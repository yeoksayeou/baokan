<p>〔中央社重慶五日電〕蔣主席因應數外國新聞記者之請求，特於昨日在官邸接見，茲誌各項問答如左：</p>
<p>問：（一）主席意見是否認為最近同意改組之政府為中國政治永久解決之辦法，在實行選舉以後，是否仍以此政府為原則，或以多數黨組織一黨內閣？</p>
<p>主席答：現在乃政黨合作之開始，將來政府採取何種方式，須由國民大會決定。余個人甚願中國各黨派永久合作，共同建設國家。</p>
<p>問，（一）在同意改組政府以後，國民黨已放棄其旣得之權利，將來國民黨在國家之地位如何？</p>
<p>答，國民黨對國家祇知其責任，而不知有權利，現在將其一部責任分與各黨派，實為還政於民願望之開始。還政於民以後，國民黨仍當與全國人民共負建國的責任。</p>
<p>間，（三）政府何時可以改組？</p>
<p>答，在國民黨二中全會以後，經政府與各方洽商，即可改組。</p>
<p>問，（四）根據新憲法實行選舉時，主席是否將為總統候選人？</p>
<p>答：余尙未想到此事，余以為還政於民以後，余對國家，對人民已完盡其應盡之義務矣。</p>
<p>間，（五）主席是否仍擬一遊美國，何時啟程？</p>
<p>答，余常盼能往美國一遊，如有機會，甚願早日成行。</p>
<p>問，（六）在日本投降半年以後，中國，蘇聯及中國共產黨之新聞記者，均得前往東北九省，自由工作，而英·美記者迄今不准進入，是否有中國以外之國家應負其責？？</p>
<p>答，關於此事，吳部長已將事實告知各位，余並無其他意見。</p>
<p>問，（七）政治協商會議之軍事決議案中，何以未規定共產黨之軍隊應縮編為若干師？</p>
<p>答，此事可由軍事三人小組會議決定之。</p>
<p>問，（八）現在中國國內軍事衝突業已停止，主席是否計劃派遣軍隊，參加佔領日本？</p>
<p>答，此事正在考慮中。</p>
<p>問，（九）主席認為今日中國內政上以何種問題最為重要？</p>
<p>答，余以為交通，教育及公共衛生三者最為重要。</p>
<p>問，（十）日本天皇是否應認為戰犯，主席對於佔領日本之各項政策，是否滿意？</p>
<p>答，余對麥克阿瑟元帥管制日本之各項，政策與辦法，大體同意。</p>
<p>問，（十一）在業經公布之中蘇條約以外，中國是否正與蘇聯進行談判，作有關經濟與政治之讓步？</p>
<p>答，中·蘇之間，現在並無正式談判，關於經濟合作方面，局部的及非正式的商談，則時在進行，但無所謂讓步。</p>
<p>問，（十二）政府何時還都南京，還都以後重慶之地位如何？</p>
<p>答，政府準備在五月以前還都，但亦須視交通情形如何，始能決定。還都以後重慶將永久成為中國之陪都，且須特設機構，推進建設，余個人願每年至少能來重慶一次。</p>
<p>問，（十三）在軍事·政治獲得協商之後，美國軍事顧問團是否可以進行組織？</p>
<p>答，此事將由兩國政府洽商再定。</p>
<p>問，（十四）馬歇爾元帥在中國除擔任三人小組會議顧問之外，尙有其他活動否？</p>
<p>答，馬歇爾元帥此次來華之主要任務，爲協助中國對於盟軍之義務，自以軍事問題爲中心，然軍事與基他部門往往互相關連，故其努力對其他方面亦有間接之幫助。以馬歇爾元帥之智慧與與經歷，余相信共必能圓滿達成任務。</p>
<p>問，（十五）由中國發往海外之電報，往往因中斷而遲延，以致失去時效，不知主席能促交通部有所改進否？</p>
<p>答，當然應予改進。至此，讀者文摘記者阿特里女士臨時提出問題，請主席答覆。</p>
<p>問，政府在此次政治協商會議中，讓步甚多，何以並不注重宣傳，加以譾明。又政府經此讓步之後，中共私有之軍隊保證全真能國家否？</p>
<p>答，余以前已言之，國民黨認為，政權乃是一種責任，而非權利，政府能將其責任之一部份交付於國民，而由國民共同擔負，此乃政府所始終祈求者，而且余認此爲余平生最覺自慰之一事。至於軍隊國家化一點，乃此次政治協商會議主要目的之一，全國人民相信共產黨對於此事必能切實作到，殆無疑義。</p>

<h3 id="c2">外匯匯率問題 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 王曉籟</p>
<p>一·外匯匯率有從速確定之必要</p>
<p>自政府改訂黃金脾價爲八萬五千元一兩以來，黑市金價彼動不已，或高過十萬元，或低至八萬元。美鈔市價亦漲跌不定，忽傳美鈔匯價將定一千元，市價隨之跌落，繼又傳爲一千五百元，市價立刻上揚，故美鈔價高時曾達千八百餘元，低時將近千元。滬市波動尤爲頻繁，整個金鈔市塲幾全爲投機氣氛所籠罩。金價的謠言可以影響匯價，匯價的謠傳亦足以影響金價，且均刺激物價，相激相盪，波濤洶湧，經營國外貿易者幾於無法動手。蓋匯率不確定，出口業的成本計算旣感困難，進口業的盈虧計算亦無把握，貿易等於投機，穩健商人無不望而却步。故爲發展國外貿易計，外匯匯率實有從速確定之必要。</p>
<p>二·當前各方對匯率意見的紛歧</p>
<p>目前我國國外匯率所以遲遲未能確定者，實因關係複雜，不僅要考慮到國內經濟情况，也要注視美國的動向。由中國自身利害着想，匯率之偏高偏低，（高匯率即低匯價，低匯率即高匯價），意見尙甚紛歧，中外的看法亦復不同。歸納起來，約有下列幾派意見：</p>
<p>（一）主張匯率偏低者。甚至主張法幣貶値程度達於每一美元合法幣六七千元之多的。其意即先假定國內目前物價指數爲二千倍，匯價亦依戰前匯率計算，每天金一元合法幣三元四角，依二千倍推算法幣，等於六千八百元。美國物似上漲約百分之四十，再以百四十分之一百乘六千八百，的得四千八百餘元，故依購買力平價計算，中美匯價應爲美金一元合法幣五千元左右。惟中國目前財政收支尙未平衡，最近之將來通貨膨脹現象或仍將繼續若干時，匯率如即訂定在五千元，不久又將改訂，故不如逕定在六千元或七千元，較目前購買力平價尙超出一二千元，爲今後半年或一年之通貨膨賬留有餘地。政府必須於半年或一年內，將財政整理就緒。此法之利如下：</p>
<p>（一）一勞永逸。外匯政策貴宜穩定。規定匯率太高，如不够平衡國際收支，勢必逐步將法幣貶値降低，時時改動，殊非所宜，今從低規定，可免此弊。</p>
<p>（二）保護國內工業。我國工業向極幼稚，抗戰期間亦少進步。英美戰時生產技術一日千里，故英美貨之價廉物美，必非我國工業所能與之競爭。惟法幣匯率降低，等於加高外貨之價格，足以保護國內幼稚工業，工人失業問題亦可望解決。</p>
<p>（三）促進土產外銷。國產貨品成本昻責，對外不易推銷，惟有貶低匯率，可以降低國貨之外幣售價，方有大量推銷之機會。如國內桐油每擔三〇〇〇〇元，如依七千元匯率計算，僅售美金四元三角，已够原本，若依一千元計算，則非三〇元美金不辦。高低相去，何啻天淵？故匯率從低規定，可以獎勵土產外銷。</p>
<p>（二）主張匯率偏高者之意見。主張高匯率即低匯價者，有以一美元僅合法幣一千元或一千五百元爲度。按照目前的金價與匯價，每一美元僅能折合此數目也。假定法幣的匯率從高規定，其利有三：</p>
<p>（一）利於經濟建設。我國工業經濟本其幼　，抗戰斯內又幾爲敵人摧毀殆盡。日寇在我淪區所建設者，亦多半於日寇投降後破壞。今後我國爲提高人民生活水準，非施行大規模的經濟建設不爲功。此種建設所需資本，大部份均仰賴外國協助。匯率從高規定，自大有利於建設。</p>
<p>（二）减輕政府負擔。抗戰期間政府借用英美債款爲數不少，戰後尙須繼續吿貸，將來本息之償付，爲數甚鉅。法幣匯率從高，則减輕政府負擔不少。</p>
<p>（三）易得美國的同情。美國此次戰後，國內失業間題非常嚴重，故希望各國貨幣的價値對美維持相當高價，俾能多多吸收美國貨物，以維持美國國內之充分就業。同時美國極願對各國貸款，協助各國經濟之發展。故中國對美匯率偏高，自爲美國人士所贊助。</p>
<p>（三）主張等級匯率制者。對於匯兌仍採審核辦法，惟視匯兌需要之種類，分設等級。凡必需物品進口所需之外匯，依照高匯率（即低匯價）給予較多之外匯，若非必須品，則依低匯率（即高匯價）計算，以示限制。輸出給匯，亦可分別辦理。其利益在：</p>
<p>（一）經濟建設與幼稚工業之保護，得兼籌並顧。</p>
<p>（二）限制人民之無益浪費，促進國際收支之平衡。</p>
<p>（四）主張採幅度辦法者。此派以目前國內穩定的物價水準尙未建立，合於購買力平價之平衡匯率亦無從決定。目前所主張訂定之匯價，皆係揣測者。匯價過低即匯率過高，則匯兌求過於供，政府決無龐大資金以維持匯率，匯價過高，即匯率過低，則人民生活大受威脅，皆非所宜。故最好不採訂定政策，而採幅度辦法。政府如認一千五百元適當時，即以此爲假定之中心點，而於上下設定變動之限度，如最高一八〇〇元，最低一二〇〇元，市場匯價在此限度內自由買賣。經過相當期間，市場匯價如長期盤旋於一七〇〇元，則可將假定中心點上移，並縮小其幅度，如以一七〇〇爲中心，而以一九〇〇與一五〇〇爲其上下之限度。如此逐漸移動並縮小其幅度，以達最後之穩定。此法之利：</p>
<p>（一）政府無須設立鉅大平準基金，以維持匯價。</p>
<p>（二）幅度之移動，不易引起人民之注意。</p>
<p>（三）目前從速開始實施，經過半年後，或能找到一個合於自然物價水凖之平衡匯價，屆時我國加入國際貨幣基金會議，勢甚順利。</p>
<p>三·本人意見</p>
<p>上述一二兩說，各有所見，倘無詳實統計數字來作證，殊難判斷其優劣。等級匯率制予主管人自由裁量之權力，恐多流弊。故鄙意頗贊成幅度辦法。惟開始實施時，最好假定以二千元爲幅度中心，上下限度任以二百元爲準，即在二二〇〇元與一八〇〇元之間，黃金牌價亦調整至十萬元，與匯僅保持平衡狀態，以免投機家套取利益。如果匯價衝破二二〇〇之關口時，政府應短期的試行無限制的賣出外匯以平抑之。正式進口商爲避免匯兌之風險，預買匯兌期貨時，如有交易證明文件，政府騐明確實後，亦應盡量供應。若平抑無效，則假定之匯價中心與黃金牌價應同時調整。如是逐步調整，迨市楊匯價長期盤旋於假定之匯價中心，例如二五〇〇時，乃逐次縮小其徊度爲一〇〇元，最後達至五〇元，即可作爲確定之匯價矣。如是，對外匯兌平價爲二五〇〇元，政府買入二四五〇元，賣出二五五〇元，實行无限制的賣。倘能於半年內達到此目的，當爲上述各項調整辦法中之最經濟而且最有效者。用獻一得，質諸高明。</p>

<p>〔本報南京五日電〕重慶訊：繼廖承志後由延安提出之第一批政治犯名單，正由政府逐名審核調查中。此項政治犯，將於最近一週後重獲自由，原則上已無問題，惟有若干名在貴州息烽等地受訓，經由政府釋出多時，且在抗戰陣營中獲得榮譽者，彼等今已觀感一新，是否願意重回「老家」誠一疑問。蓋今日中國人民已呼吸新時代自由空氣，政府自不能强令任何人返回某一政治集團，日前重慶盛傳共黨將釋放馬法五以交換葉挺，微聞政府對此舉雖表關切，但釋放之方式或不願爲戰俘之交換，政府處理此類問題之原則，爲祇須今後言政治者均能矢誠矢信，講法講理，而不訴之於暴動攫奪，徒苦人民，任何政治犯，均可獲釋，並不限於共產黨。</p>

<p>〔本報北平四日電〕週來東北局勢惟可以「混沌」二字形容之，據記者自可靠方面探悉，東北負責當局詢問蘇軍何日可完成其撤退工作，蘇方尙無具體答覆。蘇軍撤退準備工作，確有若干表現，如瀋陽周圍蘇軍已有向瀋陽集結模樣，瀋陽以北蘇軍亦有調動情形，惟外電所傳瀋陽以南蘇軍業已撤退之說，此間官方尙未能予以證實。新六軍進至溝幫子，新民後，已暫停止前進，竚侯大局開展。張家璈飛渝，聞係因蘇軍延期撤退，政府原定計劃未能如預期推進，故而向蔣主席請示。現東北中共領導下之軍隊，為數約三四十萬，惟其幹部僅新四軍之三個團及熱河之八路軍李運昌部，其餘多為彼等到東北後新收編者。前蘇軍擬自長春撤時，共軍部向該地集結，有將進入長春模樣，近因蘇軍展緩撤退，此種趨勢暫成過去，但將來如蘇軍撤退，大好東北仍有烽火燎原可能。外傳馬歇爾對東北局勢有所建議之說，此間官方尙無所悉，大連市原來可接收，但因長鐵南段為共軍活動區，接收人員安全未獲創立，故至今尙滯長春未出發。營口方面情形仍混沌，東北徒勞中正在向錦州遷移中，在熊式輝主任離平前，將召集平津各政治委員集會一次，藉與東北耆宿交換意見。</p>

<p>〔中央社倫敦四日合衆電〕安全理事會今日爭辯七小時後，方行散會。蘇代表於會中首次企圖使用五强之吾決權。主席瑪金擬將埃及所提希境內英軍並未脅及和平，但應請安全理事會注意美曾允諾俊速撤退希境英軍一議案，付諸表決時，蘇首席代表維辛斯基頓時挺身起立揚言，決擊敗此議案，並稱：吾人需要五常任理事國之全體同意票，安全理事會不能表決此議案，蓋蘇聯加以反對也。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦五日電〕聯合國安全理事會昨日午後開會時，英外相貝文，堅決要求「對英國作明白之評判」。蘇聯代表團長維辛斯基則堅主希臘境內英軍作「無條件之撤退」，針鋒相對，各不相讓，經長久之爭論後，各代表對於希臘問題，不克在英蘇雙方意見之間，獲取最後解決之妥協辦法，乃於午後九時四十分散會，定今夜十時三十分再行集會。</p>
<p>蘇方猛烈反攻</p>
<p>昨日午後開會時，維辛斯基對貝文展開劇烈之反攻稱，「余可設明者，蘇聯代表團認爲言語之惡劣，莫過於一九四六年二月一日貝文之言，彼所稱莫斯科宣傳威脅和平一節，絕無絲毫根據，况彼出此言，豈以爲與兩國間友誼相調和乎？蘇聯代表團聞得英代表忽出此言，咸感不快往事之冷氣侵襲，且能思及往時在我兩國間作祟之陰影，莫斯科宜傳歌曲，乃一舊曲，一九二一年間寇松勲爵（當時英外相）曾作此種指摘，甚且提出最後通牒，然吾人頗易闡明，寇松勳　之整個計劃，遂吿失敗，一九二六至二七年間，英外相張伯倫曾隨寇松先例，就所謂莫斯科之反英宣傳事，致牒蘇政府，此等指摘，結果雖然失敗，然其痕跡猶在，危險莫甚，方貝文聞得吾人就希臘局勢發友好的警吿，彼即以莫斯科宜傳爲言，吾人述及希臘之不人道與恐怖情况，仍被稱爲莫斯科宣傳，吾人言及英軍留駐，被冒險者與多數反動份子利用以抗聯合國，又被指爲宣傳，貝文請安全理事會明白評判英政府是否在希臘危害世界和平之問題，蘇聯代表團對此問題，已予答覆，茲再度申明，英方干涉希臘內政，已引起在事實上危害國際和平之局勢，英軍在希，實乃壓迫該國國內政務之工具，已造成特別緊張之局面，或不獨對希臘人民，且於國際和平，均有嚴重後果。維辛斯基發言，共歷一小時又三刻，結尾重申蘇聯要求英軍立刻從希臘作無條件之撤退。</p>
<p>英駁斥蘇指商</p>
<p>詞畢，貝文以低沉而疲倦之音繼起答覆，時爲午後五時。貝文駁斥對蘇不友好之一切指摘稱：無人能謂渠對蘇聯不友好者，良以當蘇聯在英殊少友好之際，渠曾盡其所能，以助蘇聯也。維氏演詞，駁斥渠於星期五日所發言論中各點，固頗詳盡，且謂去歲七月蘇聯就希臘事所提備忘錄，未包涵對英抨擊，更引述英國會若干議員附和蘇方見解之言，要知在英國對於任何問題，僅述其一方面者，乃不常有之事，渠已令其隨員以英國會就希臘事辯論之詳細報吿書副本，送交維辛斯基。貝文又追述：「關於法美英三國監督希臘選舉之協定事，史達林元帥曾表示完全信任英方政策，乃維辛斯基今對此點，堅持弗捨，殊屬趣事，蓋蘇聯政府歷次均不深覺此事，或則於吾人之行動，表示信賴也。余從未否認希臘左翼運動在抗戰中曾有良好工作，所感驚詫者，乃爲德國敗北後，彼等突然停止將德人逐出希境，而竟取攫奪權力之政策，英國所以關切希臘者，旣非由於强權政治，亦非因經濟利益之故，世人當憶自一九四〇年至一九四一年間，英團之作戰盟國，除不列顛共和國之外，僅不畏敵人進攻之希臘而已，至其他各國所爲何事，余願留待世人猜測可也。」貝文末乃重申其堅決要求，力請安全理事會明白評判英軍在希，是否保護一　人民。</p>
<p>希代表之聲明</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敎四日專電〕希臘代表阿特耐弟斯，本日午後於安全理會會議中，發表聲明，駁斥他國所加於希臘可能威脅其鄰國之指責。據稱：希臘三度被保加利亞所侵攻不應蘇威脅鄰國之名，事實上，吾人曾受我若千鄰國之威脅。關於英軍駐防希臘是否威脅和平一點，渠稱，余認此首應由英國貝文外相予以答覆，就吾人而言，余所說明者，乃英軍開來希臘，吾人表示歡迎，英軍開來希臘係應希臘歷任政府之請，英軍之來，促成希臘解放，嗣後英軍仍在希臘駐防，吾不幸發生內戰，値此時際，英軍駐防希臘境內，實一幸事。希臘人民將於三月卅一日舉行選舉，是時何人治理國家將可循民主方式決定之。</p>
<p>我贊同美建議</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦五日電〕史退丁紐斯主張安全理事會不宜干涉希臘事件之建議，中法兩國代表均表示贊成，中國代表顧維鈞認為安全理事會應表示希臘於及早舉行選舉後，可使英軍之撤退，成爲可能，惟安全理事會不應採取任何行動。主席梅金，亦贊成史氏之建議，主張勿取千涉行動。波蘭代表亦謂：如英人詢問英軍之駐在希臘是否有危世界和平，渠將答以「吾」，理事會略事討論美國「決議」之條件後，蘇聯代表維辛斯基即謂，蘇聯代表團同意發表宣言，申明英方旣已宣布英軍當儘早撤退，理事會認該一問題已吿結束，惟英代表貝文反對此項建議，主張發表明晰申明，述明英軍之駐希臘並不有危國際和平，苟能以此爲前後決議，渠同意不再有所行動，但如依維辛斯基所言而行，則不啻承認蘇聯之申訴爲有理。而貝文於經安全理事會討論後，已同意撤退英軍。貝文謂渠當不致幼稚一至於此。至七時五十五分，安全理事會經五小時之辯論後，乃休會十分僅以整理各種決議，結果並未能就各種決議成立協議。</p>

<p>— 黃炎培與記者談</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕正當政治恊商會議閉幕不久，民主同盟的主角政恊代表黃炎培先生翩然飛滬。爲了要向故鄉父老兄弟致慰，更爲了向民衆明白地闡釋政協會的成就，乃於昨日下午四時在華龍路中華職業敎育社招待各報記者敍談。</p>
<p>閃電介紹</p>
<p>雖然斜風細雨，雖然」杯淸茶，但盛况與情緒，勝過任何招待會，小小的屋子裏擠滿了人，沒有座位就站着聽，站着寫，這顯示了廣大人民對國事的關懷。黃先生　胖的圓臉，愉快的笑容，他提議先根據記者們的簽名單點名，因爲他要想認識一批新朋友，於是像上課一樣地他喊一個名字，便有一位記者站起來和他招呼，我懷疑他是否記得住三四十個陌生的名字和陌生的臉。</p>
<p>從頭做起</p>
<p>談話開始，他先提到「悲痛的勝利」，因爲是五百餘萬將士的生命換來的，而且顯然地，人民尙不曾眞正食到勝利之果。但是他說：不管怎樣，我們總是勝利了，天不亡中國，尙有今日，我們總要好好地從頭做起，而且大家都來做，一步一步不斷地做去，就必定有成功的一天。</p>
<p>朝野一致</p>
<p>他說政恊會廿二天中空氣和諧，軍事國突也已經全部停止，行前一日，首經電詢王若飛，王氏代表中共負責答覆全國都已經停止衝突，接着邵力子來送行，也說到軍事衝突確已完全停止，這是他帶給上海及收復區民衆的第一個好消息。關於保障人民基本自由的要求，政府已經將舊有法令分別修改或廢止，廿四年公布的「提審法」，也馬上就要通令實施，他相信這些都是很快地就要得到的。釋放政治犯也已經由政府通令各地，想來也是眼前的事。整軍建軍各事大綱都已經商定，但等實施。所以今後不論在朝在野，都不是說的事，而是自己着手做的時期了。</p>
<p>再變戲法</p>
<p>有人問：邊區政府的撤消和軍隊國家化兩件事，實行起來，是否將有困難。黃先生答得很好，他說：多少困難艱苦，我們都已經克服了，這兩件事，不能便說毫無困難，但在全國一致要求統一的局面之下，想來即有困難，亦必能順利完成。問：行政院長將由何人出任，答：當待國府改組後方能及於行政院。他又報吿：民主報已於二月一日在重慶出版，中華職業敎育社的工作如舊，但變戲法的巧妙將有不同。</p>
<p>最後他說月內就要回渝，出席憲草審議委員會及下月召開的參政會，記者們請他下次來上海時帶更多的消息給我們，談話就在一片歡笑聲中結束了。</p>

<p>外幣美　初開一六六〇元，隨金市而進退，最高一六九〇元，午刻步降至一五八〇元，午收一六〇〇元，全受證券帮及銀錢業套買，套積遂自七〇〇元對十兩稍稍軋攏至六八五元左右，結果較大除夕回跌八十元，港票初堅後疲，老貨自二六〇元高價回小至二四五元左右，新貨自七五元退至七三元，准成交以錢兌業迄未復業，極爲淸稀。</p>

<p>華股上場則受多方出籠新壓迫，未見振作，永紗降至二千元關內，美亞一千六，景福自一〇三元退至九五元以下，大戶出金進股，一度轉俏，永紗回好至二一五〇元，美亞一六五〇元，景福一〇五元以上，無如隔年多頭紛紛出籠，金鈔均在轉疲，環境又少刺激，此後退逐步下跌，午刻最疲，午收都以低價結束，較大除夕計永紗回跌二〇〇元，美亞一七〇，信和八五元，景福十元，新光九元，勤興六元，各冷門亦回小半成左右。</p>

<p>— 梅子</p>
<p>我愛燈，因為牠是黑暗中的光明。</p>
<p>尤其是那盞在陰暗十字街頭的路燈，只怕除了海洋中的燈塔以外，再沒有其他的燈火比這個來得更有價值，令人生敬；上元節的走馬燈誠然可愛，但是最多博得孩子們的歡欣跳躍而已；華筵盛會時的燈綵雖是美麗，也不過為有錢的紳士淑女們裝點了旖旎的風光。但是，十字街頭的那盞路燈卻是偉大的，雖然牠的光輝是十分微弱，半明半滅，在冷夜的寒風中微顫……</p>
<p>每天，當牠亮了的時候，附近沒有時鐘的人家因此知道該預備晚餐了。</p>
<p>郵差送完了這一天最後的一批信，依然還能認清每一家的門牌。</p>
<p>扶着手杖的老公公省下叫車的幾個錢，粗心的孩子不至於走到泥坑裏或是垃圾旁邊去，賣炒白菓的小販可以藉了這糢糊的一點光，點清楚蛋白菓的人是否少給他一張鈔票？算一下今天的收益有多少？</p>
<p>路上的行人無有不得着牠的恩惠，他告訴你：前面是什麼路？後面是什麼路？向左又是那兒？向右是那兒？</p>
<p>牠照着有家的人回家，沒有家的流浪人身邊也多一個他自己的影子，不顯得孤單寂寞……</p>
<p>默默的歌頌這暈黃的半明半滅的路燈，當牠每次　了之後。</p>
<h3 id="c68">春節雜感 <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— 施濟美</p>
<p>我十分的喜歡這所謂春節，也就是農歷的新年，因為當黃金也似的少年日子飛逝之後，誰都未能免俗，感嘆華年如水，浮生若夢，恨不得戰後的光陰，一天慢似一天，讓自己多年青一些時候。陽歷改成國歷，於是人們無形中將提前一個月增長一歲，誰願意這樣子計算呢？幸得陰歷並未澈底廢除，於是這必須增加的一歲年齡尚可以暫緩增加，因此這有限的「暫緩」時期遂特別的可珍貴，令人戀　；這幾天日子，　商店裏損益計算書上的盈餘，是人們青春的「花紅」！</p>
<p>臘月二十三或是二十四日，是「送灶」的日子，所謂「送灶」，是送社神上天，這規矩各地皆有，但是儀式不一定相同，不過有一點卻是一樣，就是送灶的灶神「上天言好事，下界保平安」，有些地方還抹一些灶糖在灶神的嘴上，希望他上天多說幾句甜言蜜語，大槪就是授意給他要隱惡揚善的意思。於是我們覺得這風俗太不民主了。在今日，「送灶」的習慣，似已不及往昔那樣風行，我們該為漸開的民智可喜麼？不，可悲的是，「送灶」這玩意兒如今卻漸在活人身上實習起來了。</p>
<p>水仙花，天竹，臘梅，松柏的枝葉，差不多遍地全有賣的，松柏表示長青，臘梅是梅開五福，水仙和天竹象徵什麼忘了，反正是再吉利也沒有的詞兒，人們為了討吉利，全買來作新春的點綴，連平時終年不買花的人家也破例了；設若花魂有知，牠們不傷心麼？為了不和庸俗的桃李爭艷，才開在這冰凍的臘月寒天，誰知道還是被採摘下來裝點了大紅大綠的新年？</p>
<p>這些日子該是主婦最忙碌的時候，（以主婦為主，她指揮着其餘的人。）採辦年貨，製年點心，年　，送年禮，經濟的籌劃，還有年終大掃除，差不多最　也得打「送灶」日就開始忙起來，直到大除夕，還是手忙腳亂；翌年元旦才閒，一閑可就閑得可以，正經事除了拜年就是被拜年，餘下全是玩，各式各樣的玩，連着有許多天；所以我對於過年的看法是：除夕以前的幾天日子，大家拼命的忙，元旦以後的幾天日子，大家死勁的閑；這就是過年。</p>
<p>今年的新歲，爆竹聲聲慶太平，放爆竹的人有二種，一種還是和往年一樣的是小孩子，還有一種人是我們的盟軍美國兵。</p>
<p>提起爆竹，連初小三年級的孩子也知道是我國古代三大發明之一，我們的祖先確是值得驕傲的；慚愧的是人家現在已經發明原子炸彈了，他們的子孫卻還沒有進步了什麼，想到這，怎能不為老大的文明古國傷心呢？</p>
<p>最有意思的還是守歲燭，在上海，蠟燭這樣東西，代表了某一種典型人物，通常沒有人愛接受這不可愛的稱呼；實在我對於蠟燭卻有着出奇的愛好，如果將牠擬人的描寫起來，則可以說牠有詩人的氣質，英雄的懷抱，宗教家捨己為帬的殉道精神；除夕夜的守歲燭尤其不同平常，如果我也是蠟燭的話，我就希望人們挑選了我作守歲的用途，守歲燭比生日蛋糕上的壽燭，洞房裏的花燭全都幸福，因為我也能親歷到一切舊的結束及一個新的開始，別的臘燭的壽命最多不過幾小時，牠的一夜卻等於兩年，守歲燭及時而光亮，及時而滅亡。</p>
<p>上了年紀的人愛說，「新年是小孩子們的！」這話似不合理而實有大道理，雖是從新年第一天起，無分老幼的人全都長大了一歲，好像證明了新年是大家的；其實，小孩子們要知道更多新奇的事情，盼望着自己快些長大，所以增加一歲年齡，他們十分高興；而上了年紀的人，擔憂老之將至，因此對於這非過不可的年，只有敷衍，並無興趣；，有句西方俗語俗語：「人生是一座橋，從搖籃到墳墓。」這座橋的路程縱長也有限，過了一年，就離開搖籃更遠一步，離開墳墓更近一步，你叫他怎麼起勁得起來呢？鏡裏朱顏，愁邊白髮，千金難買年少，千金難買年少！所以說：「新年是小孩子們的」！你看，那些小孩子們，正睜大了圓溜溜的又黑又亮的眸子在玩着心愛的走馬燈哩！看見剛才轉過去的那個古裝美女又轉了出來，孩子小嘴一張，天真的笑了，這笑容彷彿在那兒見過似的，是了，就是你自己，十年前？二十年前？也玩着走馬燈，啊！好快的日子，就這麼一就這麼一轉眼功夫，也像走馬燈上人物的輕輕一轉，……但是，燈上的美女永遠那樣年輕，那個將軍也從不老邁，只是玩走馬燈的孩子卻不再是當年的了。你不覺得惆悵麼？在那華燈齊明的元宵佳節的晚上，新年是小孩子們的，良辰美景全是小孩子們的，千金難買年少，我們怎能夠不小心一點，謹慎一點，珍重一點，一步一步的走過我們生命的橋？</p>
<h3 id="c69">過年 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— 于洪</p>
<p>許多年來對於過年有些怕了，但對於以後的年卻有不少憧憬，因為幾年來孤身做客，在異鄉中看到別人的團聚，是一種難堪的誘惑，希望的是以後愉快的勝利，流離在遼遠邊漠的山城的家人歸來，雖然是個夢，卻有着超現實的期待。</p>
<p>勝利後，喜歡聽無線電中的廣播家報，每天耐性的忍受着和中沙啞的雜音，知道這裏面不必會有自己人的消息，但卻望在裏面找尋一點山城中的跡象。</p>
<p>每次聽過廣播家報後便色然而喜，每一個人都重複着說：</p>
<p>「我們都很好，可以趕回家去過年。」</p>
<p>這簡單的言語裏，可以讀出流離在山城中的遠客，多麼渴望着久別的家鄉。人們捨不得傳統的舊年，是捨不得這多溫煦的習慣，我決不厚非這習慣，每年我都忍受着難堪期望着來年的勝利。</p>
<p>不曾看見？渡過聖誕節後，遠征在異域的客軍，才掀起返鄉的風潮？他們一樣，太渴望了他們那溫煦的習慣，假使這習慣的日子到來得晚，那麼這風潮必會延宕，為了印合我自己的憧憬，我有這樣的信心。</p>
<p>但今年我失望了，我更怕今年舊歷的新年，許多需索的手伸過來，我沒有錢，我不該這樣窮，但是我窮得很。有一處的傭人問我：</p>
<p>「先生，儂香煙鈿把過哦？」</p>
<p>過年的時候「先生們」原有把香煙鈿的義務，對於一個孤身做客的遊子，如果你不曾免卻世俗的　慮，這香煙鈿是一筆龐大的支出。但是我自己的香煙卻一年比一年的低劣。一位在報館裏做事的朋友告訴我：</p>
<p>「我用五分之一薪水付報館茶房的年賞！」</p>
<p>我完全明白，他沒有撒謊，並且我相信，不久他那另外的五分之四也將付在香煙鈿的項下，因為他也是一個孤獨的人。</p>
<p>這些我也情願，假如用這些錢便可以購到渴念的溫煦。沒有，完全沒有，山城中嘆誦着「出蜀難」，有人寄來幾個疎落的字</p>
<p>「何時出蜀頗難預料，當視交通工具而定。」</p>
<p>有一張報紙刋載：中華文藝界協會，將購木船順江而下，茅盾夫婦也將搭這船回上海，附有大字標題：</p>
<p>「作家去冒險，坐木船東下！」</p>
<p>過年是團聚的別署，在家過年的時候過不了年便更覺難堪了。緬望着在山城中的家人們，我想：</p>
<p>「又是一年了，我們明年見吧！」</p>
<h3 id="c70">友伴 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— 蕭華</p>
<p>那年當我正在山城求學時，一次偶然的機會，我同電認識了，我們很快地成為要好的朋友，出出進進，常是兩個一塊，要是其中一個因為什麼事暫時離開時，另一個就會感到難堪的寂寞。</p>
<p>連我們自己有時也會暗吃一驚，我們怎麼會這樣和好相處呢，照理無論從氣質或嗜好上來衡量，我們之間都有顯著的區別，我們也生活在完全不同的地方，然而事實上，我們的感情卻超越兄弟手足，這似乎是件很難思議的事情。</p>
<p>我們的住室非常窄隘，除下兩張床外，簡直很少有活動的餘地，但我們卻很愛這地方，早晨如果我們將積滿灰塵的花格窗揭開，就有柔和的陽光曬滿一地，屋子外橫着一個用石板砌成不算太小的院子，靠牆植着一排茶花，一陣風吹過，就有溫馨的香味掃進來，我們對於這一席小天地感着濃厚的愛好。</p>
<p>我們在山城的生活，日子很窘，我們的荷包裏常是空空如洗，但這並不會使我們對生活的信心揺動過，當我們從那裏弄來一筆錢時，我們是很知道怎麼排遣的：上小鋪裏喝兩盅燒酒或者我們將屋子打掃得乾凈些，在瓶裏插一束紫荊花，有過一回我們幾至到了一文莫名的境地，那天似乎又卻逢着一個什麼節日，在屋裏枯守旣不甘願，出去則花費不起，隨後我們不知從那裏揀出許多銅板來，原來是我們平常不留意隨意拋在抽屜的角落裏的，我們收集出很多，我們的興奮幾乎是不可言喻的，我們覺得目前我們是很富裕了，我們帶跑帶跳地到攤子上每人吃了兩大碗米線同耳塊，剩下的錢我們還買了一大包花生，我很愉快地渡過那個節日。</p>
<p>也有些時候我們在城郊的公路上作着散步，對於那些挽着手親熱的男女，我們常是不能掩抑地透露一種妒嫉眼光，我們心理暗暗咀咒着，我們甚至說：</p>
<p>「瞧你們幸福吧！天老爺就會壞運氣給你們！」</p>
<p>我們還歡喜作着為人們喜笑的鄉村旅行，那是我們苦寂的生活裏一絲調劑，從那裏面使我們活潑，年青。</p>
<p>但不久我就因為一樁什麼事離開了那裏，我的生活裏開始單調，像填上一大段空白。</p>
<p>雷曾經來過信，他那麼寫：</p>
<p>「今天房東太太走過來問我，她說：「大學先生，那位郭先生怎麼不來了呀！」你說我回答她些什麼好呢，我對她苦笑了半天。」</p>
<p>我接了信以後，我苦坐了半天，我陷在極度的煩腦裏。</p>
<p>現在離那時候又是五六年的事了，雷大槪已回到北方，他是否還想念我們那個裝着花格窗子的小房間，還有那院牆植着的茶花？</p>
<h3 id="c71">清晨的北平 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— 凌星</p>
<p>我想念北平。</p>
<p>仲秋天氣的北平城，早晨仍舊籠着一片靜穆，街上有幾個拉夜車的車夫，已經疲倦了，曳着洋車懶散的往廠子拉，碰見有出早車的朋友，精神奕奕的由對面走過，便倦怠的招呼一聲：</p>
<p>「早呵，大劉！」</p>
<p>於是留在街上的便仍是一片靜穆，在長安街上，這一條平坦坦的大道上，便祗有這麼幾個人幌過去。由南池子趟下去，看見天安門還是糢糊糊，懞憧憧的一大塊，那一對矗立在門外的華表，就像兩隻擎天柱子，高高的，高高的，沒入那鉛色的空際。</p>
<p>這地方太空曠，前面是一大塊絨花樹的林園，漫着總理銅像之基的漢白玉大道上走下去，有三五個揩着包袱捎馬子的客人，匆匆的往前攢趕，誰都不言語，就像是朝拜聖哲的香客，對着前面峨巍的箭樓沉默。偶然有誰咳嗽一聲，便清澈的震蕩得老遠，像是在荘嚴肅穆的祭壇下，敲破了祭壇上的杯盞，連自己都有些吃驚。</p>
<p>在天安門的兩旁，中山公園和太廟的大門都還緊閉着，已經漸漸的有些拖着客人的洋車跑過來了，車夫摧着千層底的鞋子，踏着地，「沙沙沙」的響；坐車的人都擁着用線氈包裹好的行李，和已經有好幾處被壓扁了的柳條包，這些人都不太吝惜靜穆，響着喉嚨大聲的談笑，在談笑中閃出些無邪的疎狂，讓別的趕路的漢子都扯過脖子來看，然後轉過頭來低低的自語：</p>
<p>「　，學生們，趕到天津去土學了？」</p>
<p>搯挼指頭算算看，離八月節已經不遠，是學堂裏開學的時候了，這些年青人，住在古老綿北平，緬慕着天津南開地方那活潑的學府，在家裏熬過了兩個月漫長的夏天，好容易快開學了，便急忙的提前趕回去，家裏的什麼人也拉不住，情願天沒有亮的時候起個大早，趕八點鐘的特別快車，到天津的時候還可以趕上在那渴想的牛肉館裏吃頓午飯。</p>
<p>每逢開學汛的時候，趕路的客人總是艷羨着這些無邪而疎狂的學生，因為他們上站比誰都早上比誰佔得的坐位都好，比誰都沒有牽掛，比誰都快樂，坐在車箱裏，仍舊是高聲的談論，放量的狂笑。</p>
<p>這幾輛縐由紅色的三座門轉過來，越過中山公園大門的洋車這就麼響亮着拈上天安門對面的漢白玉甬道，拖下去。北平這古城的清晨的靜穆就好像由此震破。順道漢白玉甬道的絨花樹下走過去，中華門的外面已經改換了一番景像，賣燒餅油炸鬼的，賣炒肝肥腸的，賣老豆腐的……各式各樣賣早點的攤子都擺了出來，不惜本錢的大聲呼喚，靠西交民巷牌樓跟底下的那爿羊肉館的學徒也悠着嗓子叫起來：</p>
<p>「吃包兒唊！包兒熱的唊，熱的包兒又熱唊！」</p>
<p>清晨的北平呵！</p>
<h3 id="c72">寒夜 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>

<p>一夜的風雨，滴碎了遊子的心；撩亂了征人的腸。</p>
<p>「鄉土非吾戀，親老至堪悲。」</p>
<p>為了生存，掙扎在飢餓線上，已整整三個年頭。</p>
<p>胸前綴滿了酸辛的回憶；心　深印着不磨的創痕。</p>
<p>蕭條約客館，只有寒燈獨對。</p>
<p>它依依近人，還像當年伴我讀書時的神情，但更覺得親切有味。</p>
<p>歲月的箭鏃，無情地射迫着有限的人生。</p>
<p>寒漏點點，催逝了良夜；臘鼓聲聲，送盡了殘年。</p>
<p>可是，它也帶來了曙光和新春。</p>
<p>浩瀚的前程，豈容我繼續徬徨。</p>
<p>收拾起時代給予的創傷；把握住新春賜予的溫馨。來締造我的新生。</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] Chairman Chiang, in response to requests from several foreign journalists, granted them an audience at his official residence yesterday. A record of the questions and answers is as follows:</p>
<p>Question: (1) Does the Chairman believe that the recently agreed-upon reorganized government is a permanent solution for Chinese politics? After the implementation of elections, will this government still be the principle, or will a single-party cabinet be formed by the majority party?</p>
<p>Chairman's Answer: This is the beginning of cooperation between political parties. What form the government will take in the future must be decided by the National Assembly. I personally sincerely hope that all parties in China will cooperate permanently and jointly build the country.</p>
<p>Question: (2) After agreeing to reorganize the government, the Kuomintang has relinquished its vested interests. What will be the position of the Kuomintang in the country in the future?</p>
<p>Answer: The Kuomintang only knows its responsibility to the country and does not acknowledge having any rights. Now, distributing part of its responsibility to various parties is the beginning of fulfilling the wish of returning power to the people. After returning power to the people, the Kuomintang should still bear the responsibility of national construction together with the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>Question: (3) When will the government be reorganized?</p>
<p>Answer: After the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee, the reorganization can be carried out after consultation between the government and all parties.</p>
<p>Question: (4) When elections are held under the new constitution, will the Chairman be a candidate for president?</p>
<p>Answer: I have not thought about this matter yet. I believe that after returning power to the people, I will have fulfilled my obligations to the country and the people.</p>
<p>Question: (5) Does the Chairman still intend to visit the United States, and when will he depart?</p>
<p>Answer: I have always hoped to visit the United States. If there is an opportunity, I sincerely hope to make the trip as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Question: (6) Six months after Japan's surrender, journalists from China, the Soviet Union, and the Chinese Communist Party have all been able to go to the nine northeastern provinces and work freely, but British and American journalists are still not allowed to enter. Is there a country other than China that should be held responsible for this?</p>
<p>Answer: Regarding this matter, Minister Wu has already informed you of the facts. I have no other comments.</p>
<p>Question: (7) In the military resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, why was it not stipulated how many divisions the Communist Party's army should be reduced to?</p>
<p>Answer: This matter can be decided by the Military Three-Person Committee meeting.</p>
<p>Question: (8) Now that military conflicts within China have ceased, does the Chairman plan to send troops to participate in the occupation of Japan?</p>
<p>Answer: This matter is under consideration.</p>
<p>Question: (9) What does the Chairman consider the most important domestic issue in China today?</p>
<p>Answer: I believe that transportation, education, and public health are the three most important.</p>
<p>Question: (10) Should the Japanese Emperor be considered a war criminal? Is the Chairman satisfied with the various policies for the occupation of Japan?</p>
<p>Answer: I generally agree with Marshal MacArthur's various policies and methods for controlling Japan.</p>
<p>Question: (11) In addition to the published Sino-Soviet Treaty, is China currently negotiating with the Soviet Union to make concessions related to economics and politics?</p>
<p>Answer: There are no formal negotiations between China and the Soviet Union at present. Regarding economic cooperation, local and informal discussions are ongoing from time to time, but there are no so-called concessions.</p>
<p>Question: (12) When will the government return to Nanjing? What will be the status of Chongqing after the return?</p>
<p>Answer: The government is preparing to return to the capital before May, but it will also depend on the traffic conditions to determine. After the return to the capital, Chongqing will permanently become China's auxiliary capital, and a special agency must be established to promote construction. I personally wish to come to Chongqing at least once a year.</p>
<p>Question: (13) After military and political consultation, can the United States Military Advisory Group proceed with its organization?</p>
<p>Answer: This matter will be determined by consultation between the two governments.</p>
<p>Question: (14) In addition to serving as an advisor to the Three-Person Committee, does Marshal Marshall have other activities in China?</p>
<p>Answer: Marshal Marshall's main task in coming to China this time is to assist China with its obligations to the Allied forces, and military issues are naturally at the center. However, military issues are often interconnected with other departments, so his efforts also indirectly help other areas. With Marshal Marshall's wisdom and experience, I believe he will be able to successfully complete his mission.</p>
<p>Question: (15) Telegrams sent from China to overseas are often delayed due to interruptions, resulting in missed opportunities. I wonder if the Chairman can urge the Ministry of Communications to make improvements?</p>
<p>Answer: Of course, improvements should be made. At this point, Ms. Atlee, a journalist from Reader's Digest, raised a question and asked the Chairman to answer.</p>
<p>Question: The government has made many concessions in this Political Consultative Conference. Why does it not pay attention to publicity and explain it in detail? Also, after the government makes these concessions, can the privately owned army of the Chinese Communist Party guarantee complete nationalization?</p>
<p>Answer: I have said before that the Kuomintang believes that political power is a responsibility, not a right. The government can hand over a part of its responsibility to the people and have the people bear it together. This is what the government has always sought, and I consider this one of the most gratifying things in my life. As for the nationalization of the army, it is one of the main goals of this Political Consultative Conference. The people of the whole country believe that the Communist Party will definitely achieve this in practice, without any doubt.</p>

<h3 id="e2">The Foreign Exchange Rate Problem <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Xiaolai</p>
<p>1. The Foreign Exchange Rate Needs to Be Determined Promptly</p>
<p>Since the government revised the gold parity to 85,000 yuan per ounce, the black market gold price has fluctuated continuously, sometimes exceeding 100,000 yuan, and sometimes as low as 80,000 yuan. The market price of the US dollar has also fluctuated, with rumors that the exchange rate of the US dollar would be set at 1,000 yuan, causing the market price to fall accordingly. Then, rumors that it would be 1,500 yuan immediately caused the market price to rise. Therefore, the price of the US dollar has reached more than 1,800 yuan at times, and nearly 1,000 yuan at low times. Fluctuations in the Shanghai market are even more frequent. The entire gold and banknote market is almost entirely enveloped in a speculative atmosphere. Gold price rumors can affect the exchange rate, and exchange rate rumors can also affect the gold price. Both stimulate prices, interact and surge, and those engaged in foreign trade are almost unable to start. Because the exchange rate is uncertain, cost accounting for the export industry is difficult, and profit and loss calculation for the import industry is also uncertain. Trade is equal to speculation, and prudent merchants all retreat. Therefore, for the sake of developing foreign trade, the foreign exchange rate really needs to be determined promptly.</p>
<p>2. Current Disagreements on Exchange Rate Opinions</p>
<p>The reason why our country's foreign exchange rate has been delayed in being determined is because the relationship is complicated. Not only must domestic economic conditions be considered, but also the direction of the United States must be observed. From the perspective of China's own interests, opinions on whether the exchange rate is too high or too low (high exchange rate means low exchange price, low exchange rate means high exchange price) are very divergent, and the views of China and foreign countries are also different. To sum up, there are approximately the following opinions:</p>
<p>(1) Those who advocate a low exchange rate. Some even advocate that the legal currency should be devalued to as much as 6,000 to 7,000 legal currency per US dollar. Their meaning is to first assume that the current domestic price index is 2,000 times. The exchange price is also calculated according to the pre-war exchange rate, with one yuan of gold equivalent to 3.4 legal currency per day. According to the 2,000-fold calculation, it is equal to 6,800 yuan. US prices seem to have risen by about 40 percent. Multiplying 6,800 by 104/100 yields more than 4,800 yuan. Therefore, according to purchasing power parity, the Sino-US exchange price should be about 5,000 legal currency per US dollar. However, China's current fiscal revenue and expenditure have not yet been balanced, and the phenomenon of currency inflation may continue for some time in the near future. If the exchange rate is set at 5,000 yuan immediately, it will be revised again soon. Therefore, it is better to directly set it at 6,000 yuan or 7,000 yuan, which exceeds the current purchasing power parity by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, leaving room for currency inflation in the next six months or one year. The government must sort out its finances within six months or one year. The benefits of this method are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Once and for all. Foreign exchange policy should be stable. If the exchange rate is set too high, such as not enough to balance international payments, the legal currency will inevitably be gradually devalued, which is not appropriate. Now, if it is set low, this disadvantage can be avoided.</p>
<p>(2) Protect domestic industry. My country's industry has always been very young, and it has made little progress during the Anti-Japanese War. British and American wartime production technology has advanced rapidly. Therefore, the cheap and high-quality British and American goods must not be able to compete with my country's industry. However, lowering the legal currency exchange rate is equivalent to increasing the price of foreign goods, which is enough to protect domestic infant industry, and the unemployment problem of workers can also be expected to be solved.</p>
<p>(3) Promote the export of local products. The cost of domestic products is high, and it is not easy to sell them abroad. Only by devaluing the exchange rate can the foreign currency price of domestic goods be reduced, so that there is an opportunity for mass sales. For example, if domestic tung oil is 30,000 yuan per picul, if calculated according to the 7,000 yuan exchange rate, it will only sell for 4.3 US dollars, which is enough to cover the cost. If calculated according to 1,000 yuan, it will not be done without 30 US dollars. How different is it? Therefore, setting the exchange rate low can encourage the export of local products.</p>
<p>(2) Those who advocate a high exchange rate. Those who advocate a high exchange rate, that is, a low exchange price, think that one US dollar is only 1,000 yuan or 1,500 yuan of legal currency. According to the current gold price and exchange price, each US dollar can only be converted into this amount. Assuming that the exchange rate of the legal currency is set high, there are three benefits:</p>
<p>(1) It is beneficial to economic construction. My country's industrial economy is still young, and it was almost completely destroyed by the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War. Most of what the Japanese invaders built in my occupied areas was also destroyed after the Japanese invaders surrendered. In the future, in order to improve the living standards of the people, large-scale economic construction must be carried out. Most of the capital required for this kind of construction depends on foreign assistance. Setting the exchange rate high is naturally very beneficial to construction.</p>
<p>(2) Reduce the government's burden. The government borrowed a lot of British and American loans during the Anti-Japanese War, and it still needs to continue borrowing after the war. The repayment of principal and interest in the future will be very large. A high legal currency exchange rate will reduce the government's burden a lot.</p>
<p>(3) It is easy to get the sympathy of the United States. After this war, the unemployment problem in the United States is very serious. Therefore, it hopes that the value of each country's currency will maintain a fairly high price against the United States, so that it can absorb more American goods to maintain full employment in the United States. At the same time, the United States is very willing to lend to various countries to assist the economic development of various countries. Therefore, a high exchange rate between China and the United States is naturally supported by Americans.</p>
<p>(3) Those who advocate a tiered exchange rate system. The audit method is still adopted for exchange, but different levels are set according to the type of exchange required. For foreign exchange required for the import of essential goods, more foreign exchange is given according to a high exchange rate (that is, a low exchange price). If it is not an essential product, it is calculated according to a low exchange rate (that is, a high exchange price) to show restrictions. The export exchange can also be handled separately. The benefits are:</p>
<p>(1) Economic construction and the protection of infant industry can be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>(2) Restrict people's useless waste and promote the balance of international payments.</p>
<p>(4) Those who advocate adopting a range method. This school believes that the current stable domestic price level has not yet been established, and a balanced exchange rate that conforms to purchasing power parity cannot be determined. The exchange prices currently advocated are all guesses. If the exchange price is too low, that is, the exchange rate is too high, then the demand for exchange is greater than the supply. The government will never have huge funds to maintain the exchange rate. If the exchange price is too high, that is, the exchange rate is too low, the people's lives will be greatly threatened, which is not appropriate. Therefore, it is best not to adopt a fixed policy, but to adopt a range method. If the government believes that 1,500 yuan is appropriate, then use this as the assumed center point, and set the limits of change above and below, such as a maximum of 1,800 yuan and a minimum of 1,200 yuan. The market exchange price can be freely traded within this limit. After a considerable period of time, if the market exchange price hovers around 1,700 yuan for a long time, the assumed center point can be moved upward and the range can be reduced, such as using 1,700 as the center and 1,900 and 1,500 as its upper and lower limits. Gradually move and narrow the range in this way to achieve final stability. The benefits of this method:</p>
<p>(1) The government does not need to set up a huge equalization fund to maintain the exchange price.</p>
<p>(2) The movement of the range is not easy to attract people's attention.</p>
<p>(3) If it is implemented immediately now, after half a year, a balanced exchange price that conforms to the natural price level may be found. At that time, my country will join the International Monetary Fund Conference, which will be very smooth.</p>
<p>3. My Opinion</p>
<p>The above two arguments each have their own views. Without detailed statistical figures to prove it, it is difficult to judge their merits. The tiered exchange rate system gives the person in charge the power of discretionary decision, which may lead to many abuses. Therefore, I quite agree with the range method. However, when starting implementation, it is best to assume that 2,000 yuan is the range center, and the upper and lower limits are 200 yuan each, that is, between 2,200 yuan and 1,800 yuan. The gold price is also adjusted to 100,000 yuan to maintain a balanced state with the exchange, so as to prevent speculators from profiting. If the exchange price breaks through the 2,200 mark, the government should try selling foreign exchange without restrictions in the short term to suppress it. When formal importers pre-purchase exchange futures to avoid exchange risks, the government should also supply them as much as possible after verifying the transaction documents. If the suppression is ineffective, the assumed exchange price center and the gold price should be adjusted at the same time. Adjust it gradually in this way. When the market exchange price hovers around the assumed exchange price center for a long time, for example, 2,500 yuan, gradually reduce its range to 100 yuan, and finally reach 50 yuan, which can be used as the determined exchange price. If so, the foreign exchange parity is 2,500 yuan. The government buys in at 2,450 yuan and sells at 2,550 yuan, implementing unlimited sales. If this goal can be achieved within half a year, it should be the most economical and effective of the above adjustment methods. I offer a humble opinion for the consideration of experts.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Chongqing, 5th] The Ministry of Social Affairs plans to strengthen relief undertakings.

<h3 id="e8">Another Batch of Political Prisoners to Be Released; List Under Review and Investigation <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Chongqing News: The first list of political prisoners submitted by Yan'an after Liao Chengzhi is being reviewed and investigated by the government one by one. These political prisoners will regain their freedom in the recent week. In principle, there is no problem. However, some of them have been trained in Xifeng, Guizhou and other places, and have been released by the government for a long time, and have won honors in the Anti-Japanese War camp. It is doubtful whether they are willing to return to their "old home". Today, the Chinese people have breathed the free air of a new era. The government cannot force anyone to return to a certain political group. It was rumored in Chongqing a few days ago that the Communist Party would release Ma Fawu in exchange for Ye Ting. It is heard that the government is concerned about this move, but the government may not want to exchange prisoners of war in the way of release. The principle of the government's handling of such problems is that as long as those who talk about politics in the future can be sincere and trustworthy, and talk about law and reason, instead of resorting to riots and plunder, which only causes suffering to the people, any political prisoner can be released, and is not limited to the Communist Party.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Penghu, 4th] The takeover of Penghu has now been completed, and the household registration and land registration books are complete. Under the Japanese rule, the administrative system originally had Penghu Hall, with two branch halls below, followed by street and village markets. Now the provincial government has clearly ordered to change it to county, township, and town. Penghu has inconvenient transportation, and it is planned to set up a district office in the original branch hall area, and the original tribal meeting area will be changed to "village". The village chief will be elected by the villagers. In terms of education, all schools have abolished the enslavement curriculum, and Taiwanese compatriots have been selected as principals and teachers, but the books can be completely bombed, and there are few books left. Penghu is a military stronghold. The Taiwan-Penghu Naval Commander has a branch in Penghu. During the takeover, in order to facilitate the implementation of political affairs, it was agreed with the naval authorities that administration and military affairs would be divided. Penghu is currently facing two major problems: one is food. The island is barren and the people are poor, and it is known as a barren land. Food has always been supplied by Taiwan. In the past, rice for September to March of the following year was stored before the autumn wind started. The islanders live by fishing, but almost all ships were damaged during the war, and there is also a shortage of fuel. It is hoped that the authorities will find ways to allocate funds for relief.</p>

<p>[Report from our Nanjing office, 5th] To alleviate the severe housing shortage in Nanjing, the Nanjing Municipal Government plans to construct public housing.

<h3 id="e14">Unified Management by the Economic Reception Committee of the Nine Northeastern Provinces. The Actions of the New Sixth Army Await Further Development of the Overall Situation <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Beiping office, 4th] The situation in the Northeast over the past week can only be described as "chaotic." According to reliable sources, our reporter has learned that the responsible authorities in the Northeast have inquired with the Soviet army about when they will complete their withdrawal. The Soviet side has not provided a specific response. There are indeed some signs of Soviet preparations for withdrawal. For example, Soviet troops around Shenyang appear to be concentrating towards the city, and there have also been movements of Soviet troops north of Shenyang. However, the official here has not been able to confirm reports in the foreign press that Soviet troops south of Shenyang have already withdrawn. The New Sixth Army has stopped its advance after reaching Goubangzi and Xinmin, and is awaiting further developments in the overall situation. Zhang Jia'ao's flight to Chongqing is reportedly due to the delayed Soviet withdrawal, which has prevented the government's original plans from progressing as expected. He has gone to seek instructions from Chairman Chiang. The number of troops under the control of the Chinese Communist Party in the Northeast is approximately 300,000 to 400,000, but their leadership consists of only three regiments from the New Fourth Army and Li Yunchang's Eighth Route Army unit from Rehe. The rest are mostly newly recruited after their arrival in the Northeast. When the Soviet army initially planned to withdraw from Changchun, Communist troops gathered in the area, appearing to be preparing to enter the city. However, due to the Soviet army's delayed withdrawal, this trend has temporarily subsided. But, if the Soviet army does withdraw, the vast Northeast still faces the possibility of widespread conflict. The official here has no knowledge of the alleged advice given by Marshall regarding the Northeast situation. The city of Dalian was originally ready for reception, but due to the Communist army's activity in the southern section of the Changchun Railway, the safety of the reception personnel has not been established. Therefore, they remain stranded in Changchun and have not departed. The situation in Yingkou remains chaotic. The Economic Relief Efforts in the Northeast are moving towards Jinzhou. Before Director Xiong Shihui leaves Beiping, he will convene a meeting of political committee members from Beiping and Tianjin to exchange views with senior figures from the Northeast.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] Zhang Jia'ao, chairman of the Economic Committee of the Northeast Headquarters, told reporters on the 5th that the economic reception of the nine northeastern provinces will be managed by the Northeast Enemy and Puppet Industry Reception Committee, organized by the Northeast Headquarters, with Xiong Shihui, director of the Northeast Headquarters, concurrently serving as chairman, and special commissioners stationed in the Northeast from relevant departments serving as members. The principles for receiving economic enterprises in the Northeast have already been formulated. These principles are based on the principles and experience of receiving enemy and puppet economic enterprises in North China and Central China, and the reception work will be carried out accordingly. The rural economy of the Northeast has been exploited and oppressed by the enemy and puppets for fourteen years, and is on the verge of bankruptcy. Local industries such as hot pot (using high-quality liquor) and oil mills (extracting oil from beans) are unable to compete with those operated by the enemy and puppets using new methods. Moreover, the "grain delivery" and "gratitude delivery" methods implemented by the enemy and puppets for farmers are the main reasons for the decline of the rural economy. In the future, it is imperative to give the people of the Northeast an opportunity to recuperate and thrive.</p>

<p>[United Press, Yan'an, 5th] A spokesperson for the highest political department of the Chinese Communist Party stated that although the Political Consultative Conference has concluded successfully, from the Communist Party's perspective, there are still two unresolved issues: the Northeast issue and the Communist Party's participation in the coalition government. Regarding the first issue, it is claimed that the Communist Party authorities have instructed Zhou Enlai to immediately resume negotiations with the central government to prevent renewed conflict between the Kuomintang and Communist forces in the area. Secondly, the Communist Party also wants to obtain several ministerial positions, regardless of department.</p>

The Establishment of the Trusteeship Council is Postponed. <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 5th] Yesterday, the United Nations Security Council had a heated debate on the Greek issue, overshadowing other developments. Notable points include: (1) Syria and Lebanon appealed to the Security Council, demanding the immediate and complete withdrawal of British and French troops from their territories; (2) The Soviet Union opposed the United Nations agency's proposed budget of 25 million US dollars as excessive; (3) The Soviet Union continued to strongly oppose the Western European countries' proposal to establish a special organization to handle refugees, and condemned the tolerance of anti-Soviet political propaganda in the refugee camps in western Germany.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 5th] The Chief Representative of Syria to the United Nations General Assembly, Kolay, stated today that Syria and Lebanon have requested the Security Council to order the immediate withdrawal of British and French troops from the two countries. Another dispute has thus arisen in the Council.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] The United Nations Trusteeship Committee unanimously decided last night to recommend to the General Assembly that the establishment of the Trusteeship Council be postponed. "Because the governments administering trust territories must first reach an agreement before the Trusteeship Council can be established." The Trusteeship Council is the successor to the Mandates Commission of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 4th] If the current plan is adopted, the United States will pay a quarter of the United Nations' expenses. The only temporary financial plan currently being decided is to first raise an operating fund of 25 million US dollars to meet the required expenditures in the United Nations agency's first annual budget. This amount will be borne jointly by 51 countries, with the United States contributing 6.25 million US dollars and China contributing 1.625 million US dollars.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Stalemate on the Greek Issue, Verbal Battle Between Britain and the Soviet Union Intensifies. Bevin Demands a Clear Judgement on Britain's Actions. The Soviet Side Insists on the Unconditional Withdrawal of British Troops <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 4th, Associated Press] The Security Council adjourned today after seven hours of debate. The Soviet representative attempted to use the veto power of the five permanent members for the first time during the meeting. When Chairman Makin proposed that the presence of British troops in Greece did not threaten peace, but that the Security Council should take note of the fact that the United States had promised to swiftly withdraw British troops from Greece, the chief Soviet representative, Vyshinsky, immediately stood up and declared that he would defeat the motion, stating: "We need the unanimous vote of the five permanent members. The Security Council cannot vote on this motion because the Soviet Union opposes it."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] When the United Nations Security Council met yesterday afternoon, British Foreign Secretary Bevin firmly demanded "a clear judgement on Britain's actions." The head of the Soviet delegation, Vyshinsky, insisted on the "unconditional withdrawal" of British troops from Greece, with each side refusing to yield to the other. After a lengthy debate, the representatives failed to reach a compromise solution on the Greek issue between the opinions of Britain and the Soviet Union. The meeting adjourned at 9:40 PM and was scheduled to reconvene at 10:30 PM tonight.</p>
<p>Soviet Side Launches Fierce Counterattack</p>
<p>At the afternoon meeting yesterday, Vyshinsky launched a fierce counterattack against Bevin, stating, "I can state clearly that the Soviet delegation considers the words of Bevin on February 1, 1946, to be the worst. His claim that Moscow's propaganda threatens peace has absolutely no basis. Moreover, does he believe that saying this is in harmony with the friendship between the two countries? The Soviet delegation felt uneasy when the British representative suddenly made this statement. The chill of past events invaded, and we could think of the shadows that plagued our two countries in the past. The Moscow propaganda song is an old song. In 1921, Lord Curzon (then British Foreign Secretary) made such accusations and even issued an ultimatum. However, we can easily explain that Lord Curzon's entire plan failed. Between 1926 and 1927, British Foreign Secretary Chamberlain followed Curzon's example and sent a letter to the Soviet government regarding so-called anti-British propaganda in Moscow. Although the results of these accusations were failures, their traces remain, which is extremely dangerous. When Bevin heard our friendly warning regarding the situation in Greece, he immediately used the term Moscow propaganda. Our description of the inhumanity and terror in Greece is still called Moscow propaganda. Our mention of the British troops remaining in Greece being used by adventurers and a majority of reactionaries to resist the United Nations is also referred to as propaganda. Bevin asked the Security Council to clearly judge whether the British government is endangering world peace in Greece. The Soviet delegation has answered this question and now reaffirms that British interference in Greek internal affairs has caused a situation that, in fact, endangers international peace. The presence of British troops in Greece is, in fact, a tool for suppressing the country's domestic affairs, creating a particularly tense situation that has serious consequences not only for the Greek people but also for international peace." Vyshinsky spoke for one hour and fifteen minutes, concluding by reiterating the Soviet Union's demand for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of British troops from Greece.</p>
<p>Britain Refutes Soviet Accusations</p>
<p>After Vyshinsky's speech, Bevin replied in a low and weary tone, at 5 PM. Bevin refuted all accusations of being unfriendly to the Soviet Union, stating that no one can say that he is unfriendly to the Soviet Union, because when the Soviet Union had few friends in Britain, he did his best to help the Soviet Union. Vyshinsky's speech refuted each point in the statement he made on Friday in detail. He stated that the Soviet Union's memorandum on Greece last July did not contain any attacks on Britain. He also quoted the words of several members of the British Parliament who agreed with the Soviet view. It should be known that it is not common in Britain to only state one side of any issue. He had ordered his staff to send a copy of the detailed report of the British Parliament's debate on Greece to Vyshinsky. Bevin also recalled: "Regarding the agreement between France, the United States, and Britain to supervise the Greek elections, Marshal Stalin expressed complete trust in British policy. It is interesting that Vyshinsky insists on this point today, because the Soviet government has never deeply felt about this matter, or has expressed trust in our actions. I have never denied that the Greek left-wing movement did good work during the war of resistance. What surprised me was that after the defeat of Germany, they suddenly stopped expelling the Germans from Greece and instead adopted a policy of seizing power. Britain's concern for Greece is not due to power politics or economic interests. The world should remember that from 1940 to 1941, Britain's wartime allies, besides the United Kingdom, were only the Greeks, who were not afraid of the enemy's attack. As for what other countries did, I would like to leave it to the world to guess." Bevin finally reiterated his firm demand and strongly urged the Security Council to clearly judge whether the British troops in Greece were protecting a people.</p>
<p>Statement by the Greek Representative</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 4th Dispatch] The Greek representative, Attinaidis, issued a statement at the Security Council meeting this afternoon, refuting accusations by other countries that Greece might pose a threat to its neighbors. It is claimed that Greece has been invaded by Bulgaria three times, and should not be accused of threatening its neighbors. In fact, we have been threatened by several of our neighbors. Regarding the question of whether the British troops stationed in Greece pose a threat to peace, he said, "I believe this should first be answered by British Foreign Secretary Bevin. As for us, what I can explain is that we welcomed the arrival of British troops in Greece. The arrival of British troops in Greece was at the request of successive Greek governments. The arrival of British troops facilitated the liberation of Greece. Afterwards, British troops remained stationed in Greece. Unfortunately, a civil war broke out. At this time, it was fortunate that British troops were stationed in Greece. The Greek people will hold elections on March 31, at which time who will govern the country can be decided democratically."</p>
<p>I Agree with the US Proposal</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] The representatives of China and France both expressed support for Stettinius's suggestion that the Security Council should not interfere in the Greek incident. Chinese representative Gu Weijun believes that the Security Council should state that Greece can hold elections as soon as possible to make the withdrawal of British troops possible, but the Security Council should not take any action. Chairman Makin also agreed with Stettinius's suggestion, advocating that no intervention action should be taken. The Polish representative also said, "If the British ask whether the presence of British troops in Greece endangers world peace, I will answer 'Yes'." After the Council briefly discussed the conditions of the American "resolution," Soviet representative Vyshinsky said that the Soviet delegation agreed to issue a declaration stating that since the British side has announced that British troops should withdraw as soon as possible, the Council believes that the issue has come to an end. However, British representative Bevin opposed this proposal, advocating for a clear declaration stating that the presence of British troops in Greece does not endanger international peace. If this could be a preceding resolution, he agreed not to take any further action, but if he acted according to Vyshinsky's words, it would be tantamount to admitting that the Soviet Union's complaint was justified. However, Bevin has agreed to withdraw British troops after discussions by the Security Council. Bevin said he would not be so naive as to do this. At 7:55 PM, after five hours of debate, the Security Council adjourned for ten minutes to organize various resolutions, but ultimately failed to reach an agreement on the various resolutions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 4th Dispatch] Our representative Gu Weijun spoke about the Greek issue at the Security Council meeting this afternoon, first saying that China sincerely respects and sympathizes with Greece's heroic resistance against the Nazi army from 1937 to 1945. He then stated: "China's attitude towards this issue discussed by the Security Council is that it hopes that it will not be transformed into a cause that damages goodwill and understanding between countries. China also hopes that all countries will always abide by the United Nations Charter. China is one of the Security Council's directors, and our delegation hopes to assist this important United Nations agency in carrying out its important tasks."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th Dispatch] The US Federal Supreme Court, by a vote of six to two, upheld the US Military Tribunal's verdict that Yamashita Tomoyuki, former commander of the Japanese forces in the Philippines, should be sentenced to death by hanging for war crimes. The Supreme Court has refused to intervene and has rejected Yamashita's petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The Supreme Court's decision has effectively overturned Yamashita's argument regarding the legal status of the US Military Tribunal after the end of the war. Chief Justice Stone of the Supreme Court, representing the majority opinion, stated: "The military authorities' trial was lawful, because before the peace treaty, the power to prosecute cases of violation of the laws of war did not belong to the courts, but was in the hands of the government and political institutions. And this prosecutorial power itself may be bound by the terms of the peace treaty, as was the case with Japan's surrender." The Supreme Court overturned Yamashita's claim that he was not responsible for the actions of his subordinates, and ruled that the purpose of the laws of war is to protect civilians and prisoners of war from violence. If the commander of an invading army fails to take reasonable measures to protect civilians and prisoners of war and can be innocent, then the laws of war will be greatly ineffective.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 5th] A spokesman for MacArthur stated this morning that the authority to review the Yamashita case now rests with MacArthur. MacArthur's decision will be his final decision. Whether to execute him or commute the sentence will be decided by MacArthur.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] Moscow Radio: Multiple mass graves have been discovered in the Lanchedorf area near Opole in Silesia, some as deep as 30 feet or more, containing the bodies of no fewer than 190,000 Russian, French, British, and Polish prisoners of war. A committee jointly formed by the Polish government and Red Army representatives to investigate the German massacre has determined that the German army detained over 200,000 Allied prisoners of war in the Lanchedorf concentration camp, most of whom were Russians and Poles. However, when the Soviet army occupied the area, only 800 prisoners remained in the camp. The bodies in the mass graves were stacked in layers of ten to twelve. The medical team determined that some of the bodies had been shot, while others died from exhaustion, disease, or unbearable torture. The evidence related to this discovery has been compiled and submitted to the Nuremberg Military Tribunal. The bodies have been reburied, and many people participated in the funeral. The authorities plan to build a monument on the site to commemorate and never forget.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 3rd dispatch] The key members of the new cabinet appointed by the King of Siam, headed by Prime Minister Apaiwong, all have decades of experience in politics. Pramoj serves as the Foreign Minister, Watcharat as the Finance Minister, and Sri Sanan as the Interior Minister. Among Siam's current priorities, foreign affairs and finance take precedence, hence the selection of Pramoj and Watcharat for these positions. Pramoj hopes to use his ability to promote relations between Siam and the UK and the US to negotiate with France for the return of the three provinces obtained from Vietnam in 1941. He will also be responsible for implementing the terms of the Anglo-Siamese Treaty and revising foreign policy to bring Siam into the international community. During his short term as Prime Minister, he was most liked by our people, especially after the successful signing of the Sino-Siamese Friendship Treaty. With him taking up the new position of Foreign Minister, closer friendly relations between China and Siam are expected. The biggest difficulty faced by the new cabinet is the task of financial reconstruction. Finance Minister Watcharat is a wise statesman and a capable diplomat. He has Chinese ancestry and is one of the longest-serving officials in the Siamese government. Overseas Chinese are very concerned about the selection of the Siamese Interior Minister, as his duties will affect the welfare of the overseas Chinese community. The appointment of Sri Sanan as Interior Minister is deeply welcomed by the overseas Chinese.</p>

The infants in the jars were three or four years old at the oldest and only a few months old at the youngest.

<h3 id="e40">Dikes on Both Banks of the Huangpu River Collapsed, Municipal Government Plans to Repair, Work Relief Scheduled to Start Within the Week <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>[Report] The dikes on both sides of the Huangpu River in this city, from Cao'an Temple in Pudong to Huangjia Bay, and from Qiujiang Bridge in Puxi to the boundary of Yangshan County, have a total length of approximately 30 kilometers. They have not been repaired for seven or eight years, and many places have collapsed, greatly affecting farmland and houses. After investigation by the Seawall Engineering Team of the Municipal Works Bureau, the construction steps have been determined. However, the investigation shows that repairing according to the regulations will cost 1,140,000,000 yuan. If ordinary repairs can be carried out to prevent seawater from flooding in summer and autumn, it will cost 100,000,000 yuan. This plan has been approved by the municipal government after being submitted by the bureau. However, due to the city's financial difficulties, the monthly allocation of funds still differs from the budget. Therefore, the Works Bureau has applied to the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for the distribution of workers' flour, adopting a method of half labor costs and half flour. If building materials can be provided free of charge, it will further accelerate the work. In addition, it is planned to adopt a work-for-relief system and a conscription method to strengthen manpower. The bureau has been deploying construction along the dikes since the day before yesterday and has also requested the assistance and cooperation of relevant district offices, town offices, police sub-bureaus, and local people. If everything can be resolved smoothly, the project can begin within a week.</p>

<p>General Wedemeyer, Commander-in-Chief of the US Armed Forces in China, and Brigadier General Calloway, Acting Chief of Staff of the US Armed Forces in China, sent letters to Mayor Qian yesterday, expressing their gratitude for the Allied reception held by twelve groups, including the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and local associations, at the Paramount Ballroom on January 20. The original text stated briefly: During this World War, the soldiers of our two countries fought side by side, resolutely and unyieldingly, against those who seized our freedom. Therefore, the relationship between China and the United States has become closer.</p>
<p>The good cooperative spirit shown by the Chinese and American armies in the China Theater is not only an essential factor for the victory in this war but also greatly contributes to the maintenance of future security in the Far East, and it is worthy of cherishing. In this transition from war to peace, the hidden reefs and counter-currents that can damage the solid friendship between domestic and international relations can be encountered everywhere. If we want to avoid the recurrence of the tragic disasters of war, we must strive to seek mutual understanding and</p>
<p>peaceful compromise</p>
<p>, and make the same efforts as we did in fighting the aggressors in the past few months. True understanding between the peoples of the world can only be achieved by seeking the truth with an indomitable spirit. If all countries in the world cannot be patient and eliminate prejudices, then true friendship will not be possible. Your Mayor has always had a warm enthusiasm for the friendship and understanding between our two nations of China and the United States, which is to be congratulated. Thank you for your kindness to me and my comrades, and I am writing this letter to express my sincere gratitude.</p>
<h3 id="e44">"Japan's Spy" Author Murdered in Manila <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>[United Press] According to a message from Manila: The author of "Japan's Spy," Yamura van Seber, an Italian who had become a Chinese national, has passed away. Sources familiar with the matter said: Since the Japanese army occupied Manila, Van Seber was unable to retreat back to his country and had been hiding in Manila for several months. The Japanese military police finally found clues to his whereabouts at a Filipino's place. The Filipino was the one who translated his famous book "Japan's Spy" into Filipino. After Van was arrested, he was executed in the Chinese cemetery north of Manila, or it is said that he was executed in the Southern Cemetery. It is said that he was killed during the early period of the Japanese occupation.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Whether in Power or in Opposition, Everyone Must Work Together: Huang Yanpei Talks to Reporters <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[Report] Just after the Political Consultative Conference closed, Mr. Huang Yanpei, the Political Consultative Conference representative and protagonist of the Democratic League, flew to Shanghai. In order to comfort the elders and brothers of his hometown and to clearly explain the achievements of the Political Consultative Conference to the public, he invited reporters from various newspapers to a symposium at the China Vocational Education Society on Hualong Road yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Flash Introduction</p>
<p>Although there was a drizzling rain and only a cup of tea, the grand occasion and mood were better than any reception. The small room was crowded with people, and those without seats stood and listened, stood and wrote, which showed the great concern of the people for national affairs. Mr. Huang had a round face and a cheerful smile. He suggested that he first call the names on the list of reporters who signed in because he wanted to get to know a new group of friends. So, as if he were in class, he called a name, and a reporter stood up and greeted him. I doubt if he could remember thirty or forty unfamiliar names and faces.</p>
<p>Starting from Scratch</p>
<p>At the beginning of the conversation, he first mentioned the "painful victory" because it was exchanged for the lives of more than five million soldiers, and it was clear that the people had not yet truly tasted the fruits of victory. But he said: In any case, we have always won. Heaven has not abandoned China, and we still have today. We must always start from scratch, and everyone must do it. If we do it step by step, we will surely have a day of success.</p>
<p>Unity in Government and Opposition</p>
<p>He said that the atmosphere was harmonious during the 22 days of the Political Consultative Conference, and the military conflicts had all stopped. The day before he left, he first telegraphed Wang Ruofei, who represented the Communist Party of China, to be responsible for replying that all conflicts had stopped nationwide. Then Shao Lizi came to see him off and also said that the military conflicts had indeed completely stopped. This was the first good news he brought to Shanghai and the recovered areas. Regarding the demand for the protection of the people's basic freedoms, the government has revised or abolished the old laws separately, and the "Habeas Corpus Act" promulgated in the 24th year will be implemented immediately. He believes that these will be obtained soon. The release of political prisoners has also been ordered by the government to various places, and I think it is also in sight. The outlines of all major matters of military reorganization and army building have been agreed upon, but they are waiting for implementation. Therefore, in the future, whether in power or in opposition, it is not a matter of talking, but a period of personally doing things.</p>
<p>Another Magic Trick</p>
<p>Someone asked: Will there be difficulties in implementing the two things of abolishing the border governments and nationalizing the army? Mr. Huang answered very well. He said: We have already overcome so many difficulties. We cannot say that these two things are without difficulties, but under the situation of the nationwide demand for unity, even if there are difficulties, they will surely be completed smoothly. Asked: Who will be the Premier of the Executive Yuan? Answer: It will not be possible to be in the Executive Yuan until after the reorganization of the National Government. He also reported: The Democratic Daily was published in Chongqing on February 1. The work of the China Vocational Education Society is the same as before, but the magic trick will be different.</p>
<p>Finally, he said that he would return to Chongqing within the month to attend the Constitution Draft Review Committee and the Political Participation Council to be convened next month. The reporters asked him to bring more news to us when he comes to Shanghai next time. The conversation ended in laughter.</p>

<p>According to the US Military Headquarters in the China Theater: Two Japanese generals, the main perpetrators of the massacre of three airmen under General Doolittle, have been transferred to Shanghai for trial. The two main perpetrators are Sawada Shigeru, former commander of the 12th Japanese Army in the Shanghai area, and Wakao, a Japanese army captain who participated in sentencing the American airmen to death. Accompanying these two main perpetrators was Major Doyle of the US Military Justice Department. Major Doyle recently flew to Tokyo and found the two main perpetrators in a Japanese prison. He returned them to this place this morning and they were imprisoned in the Ward Road Prison along with the other perpetrators involved in the case.</p>
<p>The US Military Headquarters in the China Theater announced today that 18 Japanese officers who committed atrocities against American airmen in Hankou will be interrogated by the US Military Commission. The Commission rejected the defendants' lawyers' request to review the evidence. The Commission ruled favorably on the defendants' lawyers' request at the hearing on Friday at the Ward Road Prison, but the prosecutor requested a retrial of the request, which was held this morning. The case will continue on February 11. It was also announced that two of the defendants are said to have recently died and are currently under investigation.</p>

In his address, Mayor Qian stated: Although Shanghai is an international metropolis and a hub of industry and commerce, the prosperity of the city depends on the maintenance of the countryside, and the development of industry and commerce requires the support of agriculture. The market and the countryside are closely related and interdependent. All citizens of our city should not only place deep expectations on the rehabilitation of farmers and the revitalization of the countryside, but also provide strong assistance.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Zhongfu Bank Ordered to Be Liquidated; Several Other Collaborating Banks Still Exist; Orders for Closure and Liquidation Will Be Issued Separately <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>[Our News] Zhongfu Bank of this city received an order from the Ministry of Finance the day before yesterday, instructing it to cease operations and liquidate immediately. A reporter interviewed a senior official of the Ministry of Finance yesterday, who stated: If any banks or money shops in the recovered areas are found to have engaged in collaborationist activities, they will be ordered to cease operations and liquidate separately. Several such institutions have been found to have solid evidence of collaboration. In addition to Zhongfu Bank, which has already been ordered to cease operations by the Ministry, the names of the other institutions cannot be disclosed before formal orders are issued by the Ministry. Zhongfu Bank was established in the fifth year of the Republic of China (1916), with its general management office initially located in Tianjin and later moved to Shanghai. It has one branch in this city and branches in Hankou and Beiping. According to a staff member of the bank, it is still unclear whether the bank's business was implicated due to personnel holding positions in the puppet regime. It is said that since the order to cease operations and liquidate, the bank has temporarily suspended receipts and payments, and everything must wait for the appointment of the liquidator before it can be handled.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Trial of Traitors: Life Imprisonment for Secret Agent <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>[Our News] Yesterday, the Criminal Division of the High Court held several trials for cases of treason. In the morning, Judge Zhu Zonghai interrogated Wang Jinfa. Wang opened the Dongya Automobile Company on Dongchang Road in Pudong. In order to protect his business, he entrusted Ito, a Japanese national, to introduce him to the enemy's military police and served as a secret agent. He used his power to intimidate travelers. However, Wang denied this in court yesterday. After consulting with twelve witnesses, Judge Zhu ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the collegiate panel continued to try Dong Jin and Gan Rangyun. Dong was a major secretary in the Shanghai office of the 37th Division of the puppet army. The prosecutor filed a public prosecution based on the regulations for punishing traitors. Dong argued that the division had revolted before the victory and was incorporated into the Third War Zone. The court ordered a judgment to be delivered on the afternoon of the 12th.</p>
<p>Gan Rangyun, also known as Gan Weilu, is 72 years old. His father was British and his mother was Cantonese. In the spring of the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), he served as a senior member of the puppet Legislative Yuan, and resigned at the end of the 31st year (1942). He founded the publication "Voice of New China," advocating the rejection of Britain and the United States. After the victory, the British Naval Office in Shanghai reported him to the city police局, and he was arrested and transferred to the court. The case had been tried once before. At the hearing yesterday, Gan claimed that he had not formally obtained Chinese nationality, and he hired lawyers Tang Huaiqun and Qin Shouzhang to argue that, due to his nationality, the prosecution for the crime of treason based on "plotting to resist one's own country" was inappropriate. The court ordered a judgment to be delivered on the afternoon of the 12th.</p>
<p>Two traitors were also sentenced yesterday: (1) Wu Yimin, a secret agent of the enemy's Shanghai East Military Police, was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for life; (2) Xu Xing, a member of the Xin庄 puppet inspection station, was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for eight years.</p>

<p>The labor strike in the Cantonese cuisine industry has been deadlocked for a week. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, representatives from both labor and management were sent to the Social Affairs Bureau for the first negotiation of the Lunar New Year. Zhu Guilin of the Mediation Section of the Social Affairs Bureau presided over the mediation. However, because the management representatives were not fully authorized, they could not provide concrete answers to the conditions and issues raised by the labor side, and the negotiations made no progress. At 4:00 PM, mediation continued. First, the issue of year-end bonuses was discussed. The labor side demanded 35,000 yuan per person, while the management side only agreed to 15,000 yuan, a significant difference.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Initial Rise Followed by Fall; Gold Market Transactions Quiet; More than 100,000 Less Than on New Year's Eve <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>During the market closure, it was said that a few transactions called for prices as high as 1.3 million or more. Yesterday, the market opened with an initial rise, with prices called above 1.25 million. There was supply but no demand. The price of gold in the capital (Chongqing) was at 930,000. Jewelry stores continued their New Year's holiday. Under this twofold pressure, many long positions from the previous year were liquidated, causing the official market opening to fall back to 1.17 million. After opening, it continued to fall to 1.13 million. At this time, speculative funds saw the low price and bought in, causing it to rise again to 1.19 million. Large investors took out gold to buy currency, and securities firms also took out gold to buy stocks. The rising trend was blocked, and small investors also followed suit and liquidated. With prices in a situation of either advancing or retreating, the situation deteriorated, and at noon, prices gradually fell to 1.095 million. The noon closing was 1.105 million, more than 100,000 less than on New Year's Eve. Jewelry stores were closed, and there were no listed prices for gold ornaments or silver. There were also no transactions in silver dollars. The black market exchange rate eased to around 12%.</p>
<p>Foreign currency, the US dollar, initially opened at 1,660 yuan, rising and falling with the gold market, with a high of 1,690 yuan. At noon, it gradually fell to 1,580 yuan. The noon closing was 1,600 yuan. This was entirely due to securities firms and money shops engaging in arbitrage. As a result, the arbitrage spread narrowed slightly from 700 yuan per ten taels to around 685 yuan. Ultimately, it fell 80 yuan compared to New Year's Eve. Hong Kong dollars were initially firm but then weakened. Old currency retreated slightly from a high price of 260 yuan to around 245 yuan. New currency retreated from 75 yuan to 73 yuan. Approved transactions were extremely rare because money exchange businesses have not yet resumed operations.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Bullish Positions Close; Chinese Stocks Uniformly Decline <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Foreign stocks also closed at low prices. The public bond industry continued to be on holiday, with no official transactions taking place. However, it was said that Class C bonds were trading slightly at 1,900 yuan and 2,000 yuan. Miscellaneous brands had no transactions.</p>
<p>Chinese stocks, upon entering the market, were subjected to new pressure from the closing of bullish positions and showed no signs of rallying. Yong Yarn fell below the 2,000 yuan level, Meiya fell to 1,600, and Jingfu retreated from 103 yuan to below 95 yuan. Large investors took out gold to buy stocks, and the market briefly turned bullish, with Yong Yarn rebounding to 2,150 yuan, Meiya to 1,650 yuan, and Jingfu to above 105 yuan. However, long positions from the previous year were closed one after another, gold and currency weakened, and the environment lacked stimulation. After this, prices gradually fell, with the lowest prices at noon. The noon closing prices were all low. Compared to New Year's Eve, Yong Yarn fell by 200 yuan, Meiya by 170, Xinho by 85 yuan, Jingfu by 10 yuan, Xinguang by 9 yuan, and Qinxing by 6 yuan. Various unpopular stocks also fell by about half a percent.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks also started to cut long positions yesterday. After opening, they remained under selling pressure throughout the day, and the noon closing prices were also low. As a result, compared to New Year's Eve, large stocks fell by about 10%, while smaller stocks fell by about half a percent.</p>

The rice and grain market will reopen tomorrow. Yesterday, the Central Bank's listed prices remained stable. Money exchange businesses are still on holiday. The Western medicine market remained brisk, with saccharin and quinine prices both reaching new highs. Black Lion and Light Lion 606 remained in demand and rose slightly. Other items were also quite firm.</p>

The first item decided upon is the inspection of raw silk. All silk merchants have been notified to register the quantity of raw silk they intend to ship for export in the near future from the 6th to the 8th of this month, so that inspections can be scheduled accordingly.</p>

<p>During the Lunar New Year holiday, the three associations of yarn, cloth, dyeing, and weaving in this city continued to deliberate separately and appeal in all directions regarding their request to the government for the return of the remaining yarn and cloth robbed by the enemy and puppet regimes. Recently, member factories of the Dyeing and Weaving Association reported that the line bills issued by the former puppet Business Unified Association had been transferred by the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Region to the China Textile Construction Company. The association and others were greatly alarmed. In addition to petitioning the Executive Yuan to issue a prompt instruction, they jointly petitioned the National Political Consultative Conference and the Control Yuan in Chongqing, detailing the beginning and end of the robbery and requesting that the Disposal Bureau be instructed to stop it promptly based on legal principles and commercial realities. According to sources from responsible persons of the association, they are collecting powers of attorney from members so that they can apply for legal relief if there is no other way. The original petition is too long to be recorded here.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously stated that companies, banks, money shops, trust companies, and other industries in Shanghai, in addition to their original legal tender capital, were forced to increase their capital by puppet organizations during the occupation, with all income being received in puppet currency. Since the puppet currency was converted to legal tender at a rate of 200 to 1, it was uncertain whether this subsequently increased puppet currency capital and all claims and debts would be repaid or recovered at a rate of 200 to 1, or whether other measures would be determined. After submitting two telegrams to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs on October 31st and December 13th of last year to request instructions, they received a response from the Ministry of Economic Affairs on January 23rd of this year, Document No. 21338 of the 35th Yu Shang: "Both telegrams have been noted. Regarding the handling of puppet currency capital within companies, this Ministry has drafted measures for the registration and handling of various companies in the recovered areas, submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval, and then submitted them to the Supreme National Defense Council for record. The measures will be announced and implemented after approval, and you should handle the matter accordingly after the measures are announced."</p>

<h3 id="e67">Lamp <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Meizi</p>
<p>I love lamps, because they are light in the darkness.</p>
<p>Especially that street lamp at the dark crossroads, I'm afraid that apart from the lighthouse in the ocean, no other light is more valuable and respectable; the revolving lantern of the Lantern Festival is indeed lovely, but it only wins the joyful jumping of children; the colored lanterns of grand banquets are beautiful, but they only decorate the charming scenery for wealthy gentlemen and ladies. However, that street lamp at the crossroads is great, although its light is very weak, half-bright and half-dim, trembling slightly in the cold wind of the cold night...</p>
<p>Every day, when it lights up, families nearby without clocks know that it is time to prepare dinner.</p>
<p>The postman, after delivering the last batch of letters for the day, can still clearly recognize the house numbers.</p>
<p>The old man leaning on his cane saves the money for a taxi, the careless child won't fall into the mud pit or next to the garbage, can the peddler selling fried ginkgo use this vague bit of light to clearly see if the person eating the protein fruit has given him one banknote less? Calculate how much income he has made today?</p>
<p>Travelers on the road all benefit from its grace. It tells you: What road is in front? What road is behind? Which way is to the left? Which way is to the right?</p>
<p>It illuminates the way home for those who have families, and the homeless wanderer also has a shadow by his side, so he doesn't feel lonely...</p>
<p>Silently praising this dim, half-bright, half-dim street lamp, after it goes out each time.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Random Thoughts on the Spring Festival <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>I am very fond of this so-called Spring Festival, which is also the Lunar New Year, because after the golden days of youth have flown by, no one can avoid lamenting that time flies like water and life is like a dream. They wish that the post-war years would slow down day by day, allowing them to be younger for a little longer. The solar calendar was changed to the national calendar, so people would unknowingly add a year to their age a month earlier. Who would want to calculate it that way? Fortunately, the lunar calendar has not been completely abolished, so this year that must be added can be temporarily postponed. Therefore, this limited period of "postponement" is particularly precious and makes people reluctant to part with it. These few days, the surplus on the profit and loss statement in the stores is a "bonus" for people's youth!</p>
<p>The twenty-third or twenty-fourth day of the twelfth lunar month is the day to "send off the Kitchen God." The so-called "sending off the Kitchen God" is to send the Kitchen God to heaven. This custom exists in all regions, but the rituals are not necessarily the same. However, one thing is the same: the Kitchen God who is sent off is expected to "speak good words in heaven and ensure peace in the world below." Some places even smear some Kitchen God candy on the Kitchen God's mouth, hoping that he will say a few sweet words in heaven, generally instructing him to conceal evil and promote good. Therefore, we feel that this custom is too undemocratic. Today, the habit of "sending off the Kitchen God" seems to be less popular than in the past. Should we be happy about the gradual development of people's intelligence? No, what is sad is that the act of "sending off the Kitchen God" is now gradually being practiced on living people.</p>
<p>Daffodils, sacred bamboo, wintersweet, and pine and cypress branches are almost everywhere for sale. Pine and cypress represent longevity, wintersweet represents the five blessings blossoming, and I forgot what daffodils and sacred bamboo symbolize, but anyway, there are only auspicious words. People buy them all as decorations for the New Year to seek good luck, and even families who usually don't buy flowers all year round make an exception. If the spirits of the flowers knew, wouldn't they be heartbroken? In order not to compete with vulgar peaches and plums, they bloom in this freezing cold winter, who would have known that they would still be picked and used to decorate the bright red and green New Year?</p>
<p>These days should be the busiest time for housewives (mainly housewives, who direct the rest of the family). Purchasing New Year's goods, making New Year's snacks, New Year's offerings, sending New Year's gifts, planning the finances, and also the year-end cleaning. Almost the latest they can start getting busy is from the day of "sending off the Kitchen God," and they are still in a flurry until New Year's Eve. They only become idle on the first day of the New Year, and when they are idle, they are very idle. The only serious things are paying New Year's greetings and receiving New Year's greetings, and the rest is all play, all kinds of play, for many days in a row. So my view of the New Year is this: in the days before New Year's Eve, everyone is desperately busy, and in the days after New Year's Day, everyone is extremely idle. That's what the New Year is.</p>
<p>This year's New Year is filled with the sound of firecrackers celebrating peace. There are two types of people who set off firecrackers: one is still children, as in previous years, and the other is our allied American soldiers.</p>
<p>Speaking of firecrackers, even third-graders know that they are one of the three great inventions of ancient China. Our ancestors are indeed worthy of pride. What is shameful is that people have now invented the atomic bomb, but their descendants have not made much progress. Thinking of this, how can one not be saddened for the ancient civilization?</p>
<p>The most interesting thing is the New Year's Eve candle. In Shanghai, the word "candle" represents a certain typical person, and usually no one likes to accept this unlovable term. In fact, I have a surprising fondness for candles. If I were to describe it in personified terms, I would say that it has the temperament of a poet, the aspirations of a hero, and the martyrdom spirit of a religious person who sacrifices himself for the masses. The New Year's Eve candle is especially different from usual. If I were a candle, I would hope that people would choose me for the purpose of staying up late. The New Year's Eve candle is happier than the birthday candle on a birthday cake or the wedding candle in a bridal chamber, because I can also personally experience the end of everything old and the beginning of something new. The lifespan of other candles is only a few hours at most, but its one night is equal to two years. The New Year's Eve candle is bright in time and dies in time.</p>
<p>Older people like to say, "The New Year is for the children!" This statement seems unreasonable but actually makes a lot of sense. Although everyone, old and young, grows a year older starting from the first day of the New Year, which seems to prove that the New Year is for everyone, in fact, children want to know more new and exciting things and look forward to growing up quickly, so they are very happy to add a year to their age. But older people worry about the approach of old age, so they only go through the motions for this year that cannot be avoided and have no interest in it. There is a Western saying, "Life is a bridge from cradle to grave." The journey of this bridge is long but limited. Every year that passes takes them further away from the cradle and closer to the grave. How can you expect them to be enthusiastic? The rosy cheeks in the mirror, the white hair on the temples, youth cannot be bought for a thousand pieces of gold, youth cannot be bought for a thousand pieces of gold! So it is said, "The New Year is for the children!" Look, those children are staring with their round, dark, and bright eyes, playing with their beloved revolving lantern! Seeing that the ancient beauty who just passed by has turned out again, the child's small mouth opens and smiles innocently. That smile seems familiar. Yes, it's yourself, ten years ago? Twenty years ago? Also playing with a revolving lantern. Ah! How quickly the days pass, just in the blink of an eye, like the light turn of the figures on the revolving lantern... But the beauties on the lantern are always so young, and that general never gets old, only the child playing with the revolving lantern is no longer the same as before. Don't you feel melancholy? On that night of the Lantern Festival with bright lights, the New Year is for the children, the beautiful scenery is all for the children, youth cannot be bought for a thousand pieces of gold. How can we not be more careful, more cautious, more cherish, and walk step by step across the bridge of our lives?</p>
<h3 id="e69">New Year <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Hong</p>
<p>For many years, I have been somewhat afraid of the New Year, but I have a lot of longing for the New Years to come, because for several years I have been a guest alone, and seeing the reunions of others in a foreign land is a kind of embarrassing temptation. What I hope for is a happy victory in the future, with my family who are scattered in the mountain cities of the remote border returning. Although it is a dream, it has a surreal expectation.</p>
<p>After the victory, I like to listen to the broadcasters on the radio, patiently enduring the hoarse static noise, knowing that there will not necessarily be any news about my own people, but hoping to find some signs of the mountain city in it.</p>
<p>Each time after listening to the broadcasters, I am delighted, and everyone repeats:</p>
<p>"We are all well and can rush home for the New Year."</p>
<p>In these simple words, you can read how much the distant guests who are scattered in the mountain cities yearn for their long-separated hometown. People are reluctant to part with the traditional old year, because they are reluctant to part with this warm habit. I will never criticize this habit. Every year, I endure the embarrassment and look forward to the victory in the coming year.</p>
<p>Haven't you seen? After Christmas, the expeditionary troops in foreign lands started a wave of returning home? They are the same, they yearn too much for their warm habits. If the days of this habit come late, then this wave will inevitably be delayed. In order to match my own aspirations, I have this confidence.</p>
<p>But this year I am disappointed, and I am even more afraid of this year's Lunar New Year. Many demanding hands are reaching out, and I have no money. I shouldn't be so poor, but I am very poor. A servant in one place asked me:</p>
<p>"Sir, have you given the cigarette money yet?"</p>
<p>During the New Year, "gentlemen" have the obligation to give cigarette money. For a traveler who is a guest alone, if you have not avoided worldly worries, this cigarette money is a huge expense. But my own cigarettes have become worse and worse year by year. A friend who works in a newspaper office told me:</p>
<p>"I use one-fifth of my salary to pay the New Year's reward to the newspaper office's tea boy!"</p>
<p>I completely understand that he is not lying, and I believe that soon the other four-fifths of his salary will also be paid for cigarette money, because he is also a lonely person.</p>
<p>I am willing to do these things, if with this money I can buy the longed-for warmth. No, not at all. In the mountain city, they are sighing and chanting "It is difficult to leave Shu." Someone sent a few sparse words:</p>
<p>"It is difficult to predict when we can leave Shu. It depends on the means of transportation."</p>
<p>A newspaper published: The China Literary and Art Circles Association will purchase wooden boats to go down the river, and Mao Dun and his wife will also take this boat back to Shanghai, with a large headline attached:</p>
<p>"Writers take a risk and take a wooden boat east!"</p>
<p>The New Year is another name for reunion. It is even more embarrassing if you cannot spend the New Year at home. Looking at my family in the mountain city, I think:</p>
<p>"It's been another year, let's see each other next year!"</p>
<h3 id="e70">Companion <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Hua</p>
<p>That year, when I was studying in a mountain city, by chance, I met Lei. We quickly became good friends. We often went in and out together. If one of us temporarily left for some reason, the other would feel unbearably lonely.</p>
<p>Even we ourselves were sometimes surprised. How could we get along so well? In theory, whether measured from temperament or hobby, there were obvious differences between us. We also lived in completely different places. However, in fact, our feelings surpassed those of brothers and sisters. This seemed to be a very incredible thing.</p>
<p>Our living room was very narrow. In addition to two beds, there was hardly any room for activity. But we loved this place. In the morning, if we opened the dusty lattice window, soft sunlight would fill the floor. Outside the house, there was a small courtyard paved with stone slabs. A row of camellias was planted against the wall. A gust of wind would sweep in a warm fragrance. We felt a strong love for this small world.</p>
<p>Our life in the mountain city was very poor. Our wallets were often empty. But this did not shake our confidence in life. When we got some money from somewhere, we knew how to spend it: we went to the small shop to drink two cups of liquor, or we cleaned the house and inserted a bunch of purple bauhinia in the bottle. Once, we were almost penniless. That day seemed to be a festival. We were unwilling to stay in the house, but we couldn't afford to go out. Then, we didn't know where we picked up a lot of copper coins. It turned out that we usually didn't pay attention and threw them casually in the corner of the drawer. We collected a lot. Our excitement was almost indescribable. We felt that we were very rich at the moment. We ran and jumped to the stall and each ate two large bowls of rice noodles and ear blocks. With the remaining money, we also bought a large bag of peanuts. I spent that festival very happily.</p>
<p>Sometimes we also took walks on the highway in the suburbs. We often couldn't suppress the revealing of envious eyes to those men and women who were holding hands intimately. We secretly cursed in our hearts. We even said:</p>
<p>"Look how happy you are! The Old Man of Heaven will bring bad luck to you!"</p>
<p>We also liked to take village trips that were amusing to people. That was a trace of adjustment in our bitter and lonely lives. It made us lively and young.</p>
<p>But soon I left there because of something. My life began to be monotonous, like filling in a large blank.</p>
<p>Lei had written to me. He wrote:</p>
<p>"Today, the landlady came over and asked me. She said, "Mr. University, why hasn't Mr. Guo come?" What do you think I should answer her? I smiled bitterly at her for a long time."</p>
<p>After receiving the letter, I sat there bitterly for a long time. I was trapped in extreme annoyance.</p>
<p>Now it has been five or six years since then. Lei has probably returned to the north. Does he still miss our small room with the lattice window, and the camellias planted on the courtyard wall?</p>
<h3 id="e71">Morning in Beiping <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Xing</p>
<p>I miss Beiping.</p>
<p>In Beiping City in the mid-autumn weather, the morning is still shrouded in a quiet solemnity. There are a few rickshaw pullers who have been pulling night shifts. They are already tired and lazily pull the rickshaws back to the factory. When they meet friends who are leaving early, who are full of energy and walk from the opposite side, they greet them wearily:</p>
<p>"Good morning, Da Liu!"</p>
<p>Then, there is still a quiet solemnity left on the street. On Chang'an Street, this flat and open avenue, there are only a few people walking past. Going down from Nanchizi, you can see that Tiananmen is still a vague, hazy big block. The pair of Huabiao pillars standing outside the gate are like two pillars propping up the sky, high, high, disappearing into the lead-colored sky.</p>
<p>This place is too empty. In front of it is a large forest park of velvet flowers. Walking down the Han white jade avenue covered with the base of the bronze statue of the Premier, there are three or five customers carrying packages and riding horses, rushing forward. No one speaks, just like pilgrims worshiping saints, silent in front of the towering arrow tower. Occasionally someone coughs, and it echoes clearly far away, as if under the solemn and solemn altar, a cup on the altar is broken, even shocking oneself.</p>
<p>On both sides of Tiananmen, the gates of Zhongshan Park and the Temple of the Emperors are still closed. Gradually, some rickshaws pulling customers have run over. The rickshaw pullers step on the ground with their thousand-layered-sole shoes, making a "sha sha sha" sound. The people sitting in the car are all hugging their luggage wrapped in wool felt and wicker bags that have been flattened in several places. These people are not too stingy with the quiet solemnity, shouting loudly with their throats, flashing some innocent and unrestrainedness in their laughter, letting other men on the road stretch their necks to look, and then turn their heads and mutter in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Heh, students, rushing to Tianjin to study?"</p>
<p>Counting on their fingers, the August Festival is not far away, and it is time for school to start. These young people, living in the ancient city of Beiping, admire the lively schools in Nankai, Tianjin. They have endured two long months of summer at home. It is finally almost time for school to start, so they rush back early. No one in the family can stop them. They are willing to get up early before dawn and catch the 8 o'clock special express train. When they arrive in Tianjin, they can still catch a lunch at the beef restaurant they have been longing for.</p>
<p>Every time during the start of school season, travelers always envy these innocent and unrestrained students, because they arrive at the station earlier than anyone else, get better seats than anyone else, have fewer worries than anyone else, and are happier than anyone else. Sitting in the carriage, they are still talking loudly and laughing wildly.</p>
<p>These rickshaws turn from the vermilion red Sanzuomen, cross the rickshaws at the entrance of Zhongshan Park, and then ring loudly on the Han white jade driveway opposite Tiananmen, dragging down. The quiet solemnity of the ancient city of Beiping seems to be shattered by this. Walking past the velvet flower trees along the Han white jade driveway, the outside of Zhonghua Gate has been transformed. Stalls selling sesame cakes and fried dough sticks, fried liver and pig intestines, and old tofu... all kinds of breakfast stalls are set up, shouting loudly regardless of the cost. The apprentice of the mutton restaurant near the Xijiaomin Lane archway also calls out with a long voice:</p>
<p>"Eat buns! Hot buns! Hot buns, so hot!"</p>
<p>Morning in Beiping!</p>
<h3 id="e72">Cold Night <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Bi Xichang</p>
<p>A night of wind and rain shattered the heart of the traveler; and disturbed the intestines of the conscript.</p>
<p>"My love is not for my homeland, but I grieve for my aging parents."</p>
<p>For the sake of survival, I have been struggling on the hunger line for three full years.</p>
<p>My chest is covered with sour and辛 memories; deep in my heart is imprinted with indelible scars.</p>
<p>In the desolate and lonely inn, only the cold lamp is alone with me.</p>
<p>It is close to people, and it still has the look of accompanying me when I was studying, but it feels more cordial and flavorful.</p>
<p>The arrow of time is relentlessly pressing on the limited life.</p>
<p>The cold drips of the water clock waste away the good night; the sound of the drumming in the twelfth lunar month ends the remaining year.</p>
<p>But, it also brings dawn and the new spring.</p>
<p>How can I continue to wander in the vast future?</p>
<p>Clean up the wounds given by the times; seize the warmth given by the new spring. To create my new life.</p>
