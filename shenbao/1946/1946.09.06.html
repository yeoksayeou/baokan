<h3>國軍前鋒進入赤峯　杜聿明飛熱河視察　冀東收復香河三河二縣</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽五日電〕杜聿明長官五日晨飛熱河視察。</p>
<p>〔本報北平五日電〕今經關係軍事機關證實，國軍昨已進入赤峯，惟迄今晨，尚有巷戰。承德國軍則掃蕩四周，由承德南下之國軍，已迫古北口，同時由密雲北上之國軍，在古北口附近正與共軍激戰中。據謂今晚或明日，國軍即可在古北口會師。今晨自　來西北開到援軍二千餘人，平古綫之收復，已自密雲開始向北進展。</p>
<p>〔本報北平五日電〕據某軍事負責人談稱，承德古北口距離匪遙，但山嶽重重，且承古之間，共軍有相當數量，故由承德南下國軍，進展未能太速。現冀東之包圍戰，業已展開，長城綫下國軍進駐義院口沿海一帶，正激戰於樂亭附近，北運河一帶之三河香河蜜抵，亦在激戰中。</p>
<p>〔本報北平五日電〕冀東國軍掃蕩戰，正於有利情况下展開，據悉，國軍已收復香河三河二縣城及馬起岱栅河村，故除北寗路東國軍已得控制該地帶平原之中心樂亭外，路西之三角山岳地帶，國軍正自東面之北寗路沿綫，西面之香河三河，相對發展中。牟廷芳今日下午二時赴唐山，聞在該地設臨時指揮所。</p>
<h3>共軍不停攻大同　國軍將攻張家口</h3>
<p>〔本報北平五日電〕陳誠說明張家口與熱河，同為一個戰塲後，記者今訪某當局，據悉共軍如一二日內不停止對大同之進攻，國軍將於一星期或一旬內，收復張家口，並稱政府不但有此決心，且有此把握。另悉，平綏綫與平承綫已同時開始行動。記者曾就此問題詢諸此間共產黨發言人，據稱共軍攻大同，乃為牽制晋南戰事，故並未考慮止行動，並暗示張家口方面共軍，正嚴陣以待。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京五日電〕中共發出挑撥性之答覆，以答陳誠參謀總長昨日所稱張家口乃國軍主要目標之語。據新華通訊社今日稱：陳誠將軍昨日之談話，與北平軍調總部政府代表鄕介民將軍致共黨代表葉劍英將軍之備忘錄相符合。陳誠已明白指出政府軍之下一目標即係張垣。</p>
<p>〔本報天津五日電〕在同城北車站機務段，四日被共軍猛攻，並施放毒氣，終致陷落，在同頃已四面被圍。據悉共軍圍城兵力如下：（一）野戰一旅一二兩團，二千餘人，駐城東北聚樂堡一帶。（二）野戰十旅廿八廿九兩團，三千餘人，駐城東倍家皂附近。（三）野戰十二旅卅四卅六兩團，三千餘人，駐城東泉子頭一帶。（四）野戰十四旅四十二四十四兵團，三千餘人，駐城北孤山附近。（五）野戰十三旅卅七卅八兩團，二千餘人，駐城南七里村一帶，主力集結城東北。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平四日電〕四日報載京滬電稱，共軍侵佔大同消息，據北平行轅王參謀長云，行轅四日下午尚接大同守軍總司令楚漢春江戌江亥江午三電，報吿軍情，並請接濟糧彈與衛生器材，另有情報一件，係聶榮臻奉朱德指令，圍攻大同，自一日起，展限一週，並限三日攻佔車站，四日開始攻城，足見大同城，至三日亥時，尚安危無恙。</p>
<h3>共軍數度猛撲被擊退　國軍堅守海安鎭　魯西反擊繼續收復曹縣</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕圍攻海安之共軍，兵力約有一萬二千餘，三日晨以主力向西門外街國軍陣地攻擊，在濃密砲火掩護下猛衝三次，均經國軍擊退，至晚再度猛襲，激戰至四日晨，卒被擊退，此役共軍被面擊斃四百餘，遺屍二百餘具。</p>
<p>〔本報江都五日電〕以海安為中心之共軍，攻勢業憶疲憊，東台共軍傾力來犯海安，有必下之決心，國軍為守衛兩泰，亦勢必堅守，該鎭戰事連續已有數日，海安周圍共軍，陳屍纍纍，記者今午接泰縣前綫電話，該鎭仍在國軍扼守中。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江五日電〕據泰縣四日官方電報稱：圍攻海安之共軍，以號稱十二個團之兵力，於四日用山砲及迫擊砲，向國軍陣地及土城內，施以猛烈射擊，繼以步兵衝鋒，激戰盡日，毫未停止，黃昏後復向城東北麓山廟及西門大街附近攻擊，我國軍始終被迫還擊，惟迄未攻入。</p>
<p>〔中央社鎭江五日電〕海安國軍在共軍大量兵力圍攻之下，固守已達六日，頃得前方確息，圍攻海安之共軍，被國軍猛擊，傷亡過半，業已開始退却。</p>
<p>〔本報泰縣五日電〕軍息：如皋前綫沉寂，海安戰事仍繼續進行中，大泗莊附近有共軍企圖活動，姜堰外圍刻無戰事，國軍正加強工事中，共軍羅有卿部約千餘人，向曲塘方面竄去。另據確息：曲塘北葉家盤踞共軍四五千人，企圖不明。</p>
<p>〔本報泰縣五日電〕確息：共軍刻大量派遣便衣工作隊携帶火器潛伏國軍防區內活動，又暗殺隊長黃某在曲塘附近活動。</p>
<p>〔本報江都五日電〕軍息：隴海路國軍收復宿遷後，正續向泗陽淮陰挺進中，該兩地共軍已起極大恐慌。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕魯西方面，已進抵柳河北仲堤圈，兩堤頭，豬廟店等處之國軍，繼續向曹縣附近共軍反擊，四日晨收復曹縣，共軍向東北方潰竄。又國軍一部於四日收復東明集，現距魯西荷澤縣僅二三公里。又共軍劉伯誠部主力，自定陶方面向韓集反攻，現激戰中。</p>
<p>〔中央社濟南五日電〕寗陽民衆不堪共軍騷擾，自動組織寗陽人民自衛團，奮起抵抗，刻已佔領寗陽縣城。</p>
<h3>魯南單縣國軍繳獲共軍文吿</h3>
<p>詆毁政府語極荒謬</p>
<p>〔中央社徐州五日電〕據息，國軍於魯南單縣繳獲共軍文件，內有毛澤東吿共產黨員書，勗其同志應作十二年長期鬥爭準備，肆力詆毁政府，語極荒謬，足見其深謀叛國之野心，而所謂和平，純屬煙幕。</p>
<h3>共軍潛伏江南　化裝刺探軍情</h3>
<p>〔本報江陰通訊〕共軍近在江南地區潛伏活動，共方華中鹽管理局，各縣合作社分派幹部，化裝鹽商，往來刺探軍事，並與潛伏同黨聯絡，對收復區之人民，一律不准進入其地區，在共軍區域之人民，不經其特別許可，一律不准出境，該區人民信件，必須本人持信至郵局購買郵票，經檢查後方准寄出。</p>

<h3>司使昨發表談話　闡明讓售剩餘物資目的　志在助我改善人民生活</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕司徒雷登大使，五日　對記者談：關於非正式小組會議一事，馬特使僅處於協助地位，負責者仍為伊本人，至共產黨堅持之兩項前提，大使未發表意見，因目前彼與馬特使仍期待即有轉機，並盼小組會能順利進行。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社南京五日電〕司使本日發表談話，對外傳美國以剩餘物資轉讓中國，將助長內戰之說，加以嚴斥。並謂：此項物資售予中國，係出於善意，志在嘉　整個中國，並非偏於一黨，况此項剩餘物資若不轉讓中國，亦將歸於無用</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕今日某昨報刋有「司徒大使對共產黨指責大使在滬與裴特森商談讓售美軍剩餘物資一事，大使即提出抗議」之消息，據司徒私人顧問傅涇波稱　，絕無此事，應予更正。至此事本身，大使曾解釋謂，此次去滬與物資轉讓之協定並無關係，且未與裴特森晤見，至此次剩餘物資數量甚大，不能送回美國，故轉讓中國，惟決非用於內戰，而為協助改善中國人民生活之用。</p>
<h3>美議員來滬轉菲　在平發表談話指責蘇聯企圖　要求美採取更堅強立塲</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平五日電〕美衆院軍委會太平洋視察團蕭特等一行十一人，結束在平日程，定六日晨九時飛滬，轉馬尼剌視察。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平五日電〕美衆院軍委會委員聲稱：美國對蘇態度，應轉強硬，否則，中國若未能解決其國內問題，美國恐將成替罪之羔羊。因美國已出任國府與中共之調解人，故中國業已爆發大規模內戰，勢將歸咎於美國。據該委員團發言人民主黨衆議員西克斯稱：馬歇爾特使及其携來協助排解中國問題之人員，現正担任犧牲一己而不討好之偉大任務，然彼等之努力，現因中國兩黨各不相讓，而備受阻碍。解決中國爭議之談判失敗，多半應歸咎於蘇方勢力，中共「因奉有上峯命令，或因軍事首腦之不負責任」，已在華北及東北破壞停戰命令。蘇聯力圖控制全中國，已在進行中，一旦成功，吾人可準備完全退出東方。美國旣關心世界和平，決不能默認此種事態云。</p>
<h3>軍隊副食費取消　按規定配發實物</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕聯勤總部公布陸軍補給辦法九月份另行規定，凡經整編後各師副食，不再發費，一律按照規定配發實物。</p>

<p>〔本報紐約特派員四日電〕美國行星影片公司準備與中國著名電影導演孫瑜合作攝製影片一部，此為中美電影員第一次之合作，該片題名「中國人眼中的美國，」由孫瑜編劇兼導演，旅居紐約已經一年之中國名星黎莉莉將在該片中飾一女記者。行星影片公司已電邀現在上海之影星金燄趕赴美國參加演劇，其餘美國演員正由行星公司特色中</p>
<h3>共黨冷淡回復拖局　五人會遙遙無期　馬司昨共同約晤周恩來</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕非正式小組會議之召開，已遙遙無期，似將有流產迹象。惟司徒大使與馬特使目前仍在作最後之努力。五日上午十時，馬特使訪司使，談一小時，聞係對中共所提兩項先決條件問題之癥結加以硏究，馬使返行館後，即接見俞大維，俞表示不發表任何意見，因彼并非代表政府來訪，而因其他問題有所商談。末稱：政府現仍極具誠意與容忍，以尋求和平。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕周恩來五日下午四時半訪馬特使，適司徒大使早一刻鍾抵達，三人當即進行晤談，至下午七時半，大使辭出返使館，並赴另一私人約會，周氏與馬帥談至下午八時即同進晚餐，九時一刻周氏始返。據中共代表團發言人稱：本日談話主題，仍為二項先決條件，並謂，如對停戰有保證，改組政府等即提政協會議解決亦可，然政府尚無答覆，今日所談仍無結果，小組會議將無法提及。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕記者五日晚訪吳秘書長鐵城，據稱：吾等仍在等候周恩來，等候開會之期到來，此種拖延書面之造成，應由共產黨負其責。又某外籍人士稱：余意總會有辦法，僵局不會長此下去。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京五日電〕非正式五人小組會議，迄五日晚止仍未正式聚會，政府代表及美大使司徒雷登氏均在靜待中，會談之序幕甫行展開，由於共黨對參與會談態度之冷淡，已呈擱淺之勢。共黨代表周恩來，四日晚與馬帥長談後，即宣稱「局勢嚴重，毫無結果」，共黨發言人日昨並稱：美國適於是時與政府簽定巨額美國剩餘物資之讓售，足以帮助內戰擴大，聞中共並已向馬帥抗議此事。由上述跡象，可指明會談正式舉行前尚多陰霾，然司徒大使對會談前途仍抱重大希望。馬帥五日晨十時曾訪大使，談一時半，下午四時半馬帥司使共同約晤周氏於馬帥行館，大使於七時辭出時，馬，周仍在繼續商談中，周氏於九時始行辭出。</p>
<h3>中央各機關編製明年度預算草案</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕明年度中央各機關預算，十月內可決定，若干機關已將預算草案送行政院，惟地方預算則因財政改制，編製稍緩。據有　方面訊，明年度財政收入，主要寄託於稅收及國營事業，至敵偽產業之處理，預定年內結束，即使不能如期辦竣，此項收入在新預算中，亦不列作重要項目。</p>

<p>〔本報牯嶺五日電〕靑年團全代大會六日舉行第五次會議，即入討論階段，其中心議題為確定團的性質，聞蔣主席·陳誠總長均擬親臨主持，俾聽取各代表之意見，就大會空氣及一般之趨向觀察，該團成為新中國新靑年唯一之獨立革命政團，頗有可能。</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺五日電〕靑年團二全大會，五日晨八時半舉行第四次大會，出席列席共七百餘人，由主席團第四組賀衷寒，王志遠，許素玉主席，檢討學校團務，發言者仍踴躍，僉認學校團務之缺點，在　費艱苦，訓練疏忽及領導失力，而其優點則為經常能予學生以國內外之眞切認識，繼由艾沙作邊疆團務補充報吿，並通過（一）前書記長張治中自主新政，造福邊疆靑年，厥功甚偉，應由大會去電慰勉。（二）舉行一邊疆團務晚會，予會衆以硏究邊疆團務之自由輕鬆機會，最後由李義代表廿七個海外單位，報吿海外團務，至十一時半散會，下午大會提案審查宣言起草工作報吿審查各委會分別開會，主席團亦開會，決定變更六日第五次大會議程，請團長蒞臨主持，聽取代表對團的性質之意見。又大會代表一百卅萬團員，慰問全體國軍將士之電文已發，請國防部轉知</p>

<p>〔本報南京五日電〕五日白部長代表蔣主席檢閱傘兵總隊，地點是在中華門外交通學校，上午八時隆重的校閱式開始，當記者參入校閱官的行列裏，在號聲中行進到這班特種兵之前時，遙望國旗飛揚，映着綠色的山巒，充份表露新生的朝氣。白部長領導在先，全體校閱官在秋陽下隨同檢閱，白部長很愉快一再對記者說，這是新興的兵種，値得提倡，傘兵將在未來的戰爭中，佔有極重要的地位。白氏並對士兵身體生活，加以垂詢，始終面現笑容，有親切之感。　閱後是參觀各種裝備傘，裝備包，裝備桶，各種應用器具，並詳加調整，對於摺傘一項，加以表演。室內參觀完畢後，接着就是傘兵基本訓練的動的表演，如機門跳出，滾翻練習，着陸訓練，操傘吊架，立體模型，跳傘等項目，並且接着一幅逼眞的戰塲在你面前展開，這個項目呌戰塲心理測騐，運用地雷爆炸，手溜彈，煙幕，機槍，鐵絲網各種武器。開始時只見一堆堆黃色綠色黑色的濃煙，自各個據點飄起，立時掩蔽了正在匐伏前進即將越鐵絲網而過的士兵，美麗的煙陣加濃，歷久不散，而不斷的聯珠砲機槍聲，響澈山巒，彈越低空而去，一旁觀戰的記者，一時就權充了戰地記者，心魂不定。接着還有很多表演。在驕陽下走了三小時，回到室內，大家都精神疲憊。白氏問：「你們看軍人好當否？」記者答：「我做一天就要垮台」。白氏大笑，實在記者早已支持不住了。下午一時開始，還有跳傘的表演，有更精彩的節目，三架P—17型的飛機，吐出了卅六個健兒，他們從高空飛下來，每個人帶了一朶花，白的紅的黃的綠的，熨貼在無限好的碧天裏，你把他當作了圖畫，然而你看着在飛機上跳下來時，却又會心弦為之緊張。他們都有健康的身心，有鋼鐵的體魄，有鎭定的心。想　從高空一千公尺凌空跳下來，你能不急嗎？記者去訪他們這批從天上落下來的英雄，大家均在飛機翼下，綠色的草地是櫈，他們活躍得像孩子，他們說「跳」第一次有點怕，第二次不怕，第三次怕了，以後越跳越怕。烏啓發是第一個跳下來的，結實鎭定活潑，是個優秀的健兒，每一次自離機至地面，共計廿五鈔鍾，還有王葆聖·朱定·紀旦初，都是最初跳下來的。表演完畢，在勵志社大家聚餐，直至五時始畢，六日晨由白部長作一次講評。</p>

<h3>行總工作檢討會開幕　蔣主席頒發訓詞　盼能排除困難發揮實效</h3>

<h3>蔣廷黻痛陳利弊　指出樂觀·不滿·棘手·諸點</h3>
<p>蔣署長今晨致詞時，對我國未能接到公允之救濟一事，表示不滿。蔣氏稱：聯總之總經費爲卅億美金，我國所得者約値六七億，數目誠鉅，但以收復區人口計，則所得者僅美金兩元，與歐洲各國每人平均可得四十元者相差太遠，即與以前之敵國義大利，每人可得十元以上，亦不能相比，此事余（蔣氏自稱）個人始終感覺不痛快。蔣氏於檢討過去工作時，舉出若干令人樂觀之事實，第一爲湘桂兩省的有五百萬人因獲得聯總物資而生：第二爲黃河長江河提興修情形進展良好，局勢若改善，黃河堵口工程可望於年底完成；第三爲遣送難民已有七十萬，由後方重歸家園，遣送僑胞工作亦在進行中；第四為農業改善，在廣西等省，頗有成效，惟在進行此類工作時，曾遭遇種種挫折，主要爲組織不好，其次爲交通條件不够。蔣氏最感不滿者，爲若干方面採用征工征物辦法，致使人民負担因而加重。蔣氏特別鄭重指出：自今以後，行總將不再支持任何採用此類方法之地區。另一使蔣氏深惡痛絕之事，爲大批聯總物資輾轉進入包工者之手，有人中飽，致作工者不能得其實惠，表示決設法予以根絕。並謂：「以後不工作者決不令其獲得糧食」。談及今後工作方針時，蔣氏稱：冬季即届，須預爲籌製寒衣，並列農業工作爲首要之舉。蔣氏繼述行總困難，認最感棘手者爲經費，政府預算雖列有鉅額善後救濟費，然行總分文未得，迄目前止，行總全賴借貸與出售物資維持。第二棘手之事爲交通困難，目前水陸運輸皆感不够，故不顧航業方面反對，仍主張應用外輸，蓋運轍分發愈多，則聯總運交我人者亦愈多云。</p>
<h3>滬分署長報告　最近工作情况</h3>
<p>午後舉行二次大會時，上海分署副署長王人麟報吿該署最近工作情况稱：上海所受災患，以工業界較重，因之本署工作「善後」重於「救濟」，自去年十月十二日迄本年七月底止，主要工作爲辦理緊急救濟，九閱月來領受補助賑品者，達九十七萬人，所散發之麵粉計一萬一千七百二十噸，受賑者中有七萬二千名爲失業工人，此係奉政院命令辦理者，上月份已結束，本署所遣送之難胞共一二七另二人，未送出者僅六百餘人，本月底可送完。本年五月間，本署曾召集各慈善團體及其他各有關機關開會，盼各機關勿專賴行總物資。自六月份起，本署物資供應即按八折發給，七月份再打八折，期能逐漸减少，至年底時，常能不再依賴本署，第二項重要工作爲衛生救濟，包括分配醫藥器材，設立免費病床與配給魚肝油奶粉等，截至七月底，共發出魚肝油九千餘磅。演奶粉七萬三千聽，入署後，又會辦理防疫工作，此事本月底可結束，另一重要工作，爲與工務局疏濬河道與修理浦東河堤，由本署供給麵粉，抽水機，運輸工具等。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>誰使中國局勢嚴重？</h3>
<p>我們初以爲五人小組在前天可以開始商談了，因寄以嘗試成功的希望。詎知周恩來離滬時說一聲嘗試，就含蓄着不願成功的意義在裏面，故到京以後，五人小組並不就舉行，昨天且更有擱淺流產的傳說。雖然馬帥司使還在晤談，力想打開僵局，吳鐵城張厲生兩位政府代表也還說願望成功，而周恩來却直說「局勢嚴重」，可見中共代表除了用那向延安請示的「拖」的方法而外，實在依然抱住「先決條件」不放，躱避他先前業已同意的五人小組的召開。這就是「局勢嚴重」　結之所在。</p>
<p>中國的局勢嚴重，其實不自今日始。自去年日寇投降之初，朱德將軍在延安發出爭取受降的白話通電以後，一年以來，局勢無日不在嚴重之中，而且其嚴重程度也祗有一天一天的加深。雖然中間有中共黨魁毛澤東重慶之行，有」而再，再而三停戰令的頒發，有政協會議的舉行，有整編統編方案的簽訂，這一切的一切，好像都不過是中共爲了鞏固和發展「解放區」而執行它「全面戰略」，因時制宜的過程，都不渦是中共在它奪取整個政權的行進行列巾所用以歡脚的凉亭。故「打」固然是嚴重，「談」也還是嚴重。照以往的談法，談不過是兩次大打中間的小休息；這種吃講茶式的談，那裏會不嚴重？這種談，根本上談不上「政治解決」的。</p>
<p>中共口頭上大喊和平，實際上迷信打仗；這是中國局勢嚴重的原因。不僅此也；中共表面上希望世界和平，　于裏却力圖製造中國成爲一個世界第三次大戰的爆發地；這更是中國局勢爲何日趨嚴重的眞正癥結所在。前幾天發現於各報的中共秘密文件，今更知道它是根據世界革命行動委員會的命令而來的。原來中共所希　的，所執行的，就是它寢寐以求的「世界革命」在中國的策略。中共的要人們無非夢想世界第三次大戰可能爆發，而這未來的大戰正是世界革命的溫牀，中共就有在中國預爲佈置此一溫牀的　務。一年以來，中國局勢之所以日趨嚴重，就是中共處心積獻要想佈置此一溫牀的結果。中共手造此嚴重的局勢，而周恩來却先喊「局勢嚴重」，好像他深怕嚴重一般，這正如強盜一而打刧了人家，一面却大喊街坊說遭了盜刧，有異曲同工之妙。</p>
<p>不過我們倒要喚醒這些夢想三次大戰者一句話：三次大戰姑無論是否會有，就使會有而是否即在目前，究竟再來一次世界大戰於中國有無好處？自然我們也知道，中共本來不把中國的好處打算在內，但無論如何，中共在中國境內高唱反美，力示親蘇，故意要想在我們的兩大盟邦美蘇之間，分別親疏厚薄甚至或友戰敵的情緒出來，使整個世界大局目前似乎存在着的裂痕，在中國先讓它格外顯現，馴至不惜把中國先投到中共所夢想的未來世界大戰中供戰塲之用，究竟良心上有些過不去罷</p>
<p>所以，我們以爲今天的中國大局，是中國內政問題，不應時時處處聯想到國際局勢。中共越想在中國製造三次大戰，我們越應迅速消除它這種可以釀成大戰的因素。而入手之方，就該不外能誠意的談則談，吾則斷然放棄姑息政策。假如沒有決斷，則姑息一查奸，局勢祗有更嚴重的！</p>
<h3>列强殖民政策的考騐</h3>
<p>中國代表團已向巴黎和會提議，主張義大利前殖民地里比亞立即宣吿獨立，如不可能，亦應提交聯合國機構託管若干年，至期滿後宣吿獨立。這一個正義的呼聲，不僅可以表示中國對於世界殖民地所採取的開明態度，抑且中國向來對各殖民地人民在受人統治下的生活，異常同情，亦可於此獲一明證。所以在中國代表提出這樣的一個建議之後，已引起世界各國的注意與重視。王世杰外長爲使各國更容易明瞭中國提出此案的動機起見，特別於前天晚上，在巴黎招待報界，闡明中國代表團光明磊落的態度，他說：「中國在巴黎和會中旣不欲要求割地，亦不欲要求賠款，但對於義大利舊有殖民地的處置，不得不提出這樣的一個建議」。</p>
<p>殖民地是資本帝國主義時代的產物，也是國際間發生糾紛，衝突，乃至戰爭的來源。第一次世界大戰固然可目以爲英德兩國爭取殖民地的戰爭，就是第二次世界大戰爆發的根木原因，也在德義日三個法西斯國家要求殖民地問題無法解決。所以有遠見的政治外交家，早已料到，如欲消滅國際糾紛，衝突，以及戰爭，則非根本剷除殖民地制度不可。誠如美國故總統羅斯福於一九四三年加薩勃蘭卡會議時稱：「殖民地制度即戰爭之謂，如以爲美軍因凱覦英法荷三國殖民地而在太平洋流血作戰，此乃不可思議的錯誤」！</p>
<p>聯合國在這次大戰中所以能獲得勝利，不能不說是羅斯福總統理想的成功。戰後如欲締造和平，使世界步入和平民主的新時代，則選須遵照羅斯福總統的意志，繼續努力以求貫澈。但是在事實上，戰後列强，不論在去年九月間五國外長會議中，或在今年五月間四國外長會議中，討論及義大利舊有殖民地時，均以各自的利益為出發點，而未能以羅斯福總統的遺思作為討論此項問題的基礎。因此，在對義和約草案中，對於義國前殖民地的處置問題，並沒有切實的規定。中國代表團提出這個修正案，乃在彌補這一個缺陷，果能如願通過，則世界各國都能明瞭列强對於殖民地的態度了。所以，不論在理論上或實際上，中國代表團的提議，是値得各國代表　密考慮的。</p>
<p>在大戰之前，列强在世界各重要地區，互相爭取「勢力範圍」，固然是殖民地制度所造成的惡果；但是在大戰之後，又有什麼「安全地帶」之說，高唱入雲，其實也是殖民地制度留下的餘毒。赤裸裸的講，無非想「我爲刀俎，人爲魚肉」，藉「安全地帶」的美名，實行役使他人的手法而已。展望今後世界的前途，離開消滅殖民地制度的時代，恐怕還極遼遠。但無論如何，人類應該具有前進向上的精神，與一切黑暗勢力鬥爭。中國代表團主張里比亞立即宣吿獨立，成至少在獨立前，先交聯合國託管至完全獨立時爲止，這一提議列强是否同意，常可視爲列强殖民政策的一大考騐。</p>

<h3>聯合國秘書長宣布大會决如期召開　希臘代表出席安理會　痛斥烏克蘭代表言論</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約州成功湖四日電〕聯合國大會奉命於本月廿三日如期召開，蘇聯反對已被置之不顧。秘書長賴依今日發表此項聲明，並稱並未收到延期開會之正式要求。大會定於廿三日晚九時（標準時間）在紐約州弗勒興市政廳開幕，由杜魯門總統及大會主席史巴克（比利時外長）致開會詞。</p>
<p>〔中央社巴黎四日合衆電〕英美二國頃反對蘇聯提提，聯合國大會延至十一月於巴黎或日內瓦召開之提議，此項提議乃維辛斯基向四大國會議提出，遭反對後，會議對此問題仍陷僵局，據此項無結果之四強會議，係於貝爾納斯赴德前夕所召開者。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎五日廣播美國成功湖訊：今日下午三時四十五分，安理會舉行第六十一次會議，希臘代表出席慷慨陳詞，痛斥烏克蘭所提出之控訴案，據謂，希臘乃一獨立自由國家，任何外國干涉均不容許。繼稱渠可提出種種事實，證明希臘非但未威脅巴爾幹和平，且為和平之因素，危害和平者，實另有其人云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約成功湖四日電〕聯合國安理會本日開會，討論烏克蘭控訴希臘案，由烏克蘭外長馬勞爾斯基發言，歷三小時之久。演說中對英國指責之甚，一如希臘。略謂，英國在希臘樹立武裝隊伍，事實俱在，英軍曾以軍器供給希臘農民，令其投效英軍。英外相貝文與首相艾德禮保證於希臘公民投票舉行後，英軍立即自希臘撤退，此項諾言並未實現。時局已趨惡化，內戰終將發生，安理會各代表應聽取希臘民主領袖之陳述，乃可明瞭時局之眞相。希臘現政府於本年三月間執政以還，即在軍政方面實行肅淸行動，企圖消滅民主份子，同時並解散工會，希臘政府所發起之討伐行動，事實上係針對國內少數民族，尤其是對於斯拉夫人民。至以最近之公民投票而論，乃為英國干涉希臘內政之結果。英國出其全力，欲使希臘「左派全國聯合陣綫」解除武裝，英軍官參加希臘討伐行動，英國並控制希臘經濟。凡此各節，違反聯合國憲章第二章第七條。安理會務必制止英國干涉希臘內政，澄淸該國局勢，確保自由的公民投票之舉行。以希臘對阿爾巴尼亞之邊界紏紛而論，希臘之侵略意向，不僅針對阿爾巴尼亞，且針對南斯拉夫，此種意向實危害巴爾幹之和平與安全。總而言之，安理會應採取適當步驟，以確保全體聯合國所謁求之和平云。馬氏此項指責，希臘代表定本日加以答應。</p>
<h3>蘇聯為維持威望　將發動外交攻勢</h3>

<h3>美英蘇三強關係將有大轉變</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦四日電〕據此間消息靈通人士談稱：現有種種理由，相信英美蘇三強間之關係，即將發生重大變更。蘇外長莫洛托夫莫斯科之行，可證明英蘇關係已到達一轉捩點。關於此層，必須檢討過去種種事實，始可明瞭梗槪。查三強間關係，尤其是英蘇兩國間關係，自勝利伊始，即吿惡化，美國則居於調解者地位，及至英前首相邱吉爾訪問美國後，大局即為一變。自是以還，杜魯門總統及貝爾納斯國務卿對蘇聯態度日益堅決，而英國則袖手旁觀。美國此項堅決態度，難得英外部與軍界之贊同，但過去數星期以來，英政界方面已開始表示相當焦慮。美國報紙已新戰爭不可避免為言，但英國輿論則開始對蘇採取較為溫和之政策，此種態度在美國與南斯拉夫最近爭執（即美機被南國擊落事件）中已表而出之。當時英國雖贊同美國對南國所提出之最後通諜，但希望此事和平解決。英國報紙反映此種希望，不僅以工黨報紙及左派報紙為然，甚至一部份地方性之自由派報紙，於獲悉蘇聯之觀點後，亦主張重新努力。工黨訪蘇代表團即於此時前後自莫斯科返倫敦，該團向艾德禮首相提出之報吿書比較樂觀，殆無疑義。據聞報吿書並不涉及外交政策，但拉斯基敎授（工黨執委會主席，即訪蘇代表團長）及其同僚給予一種印象，即英政府對東歐各國之內政，如能表示擴大的諒解，則中歐各國共黨與英工黨間，有協調之可能性。同時，史達林元帥似將拉斯基敎授，作為艾德禮首相直接代表看待。職是之故，當蘇聯一再要求修改蒙德婁公約（即保障土耳其海峽中立地位之公約）時，倫敦方面顯有一種趨勢，欲對蘇聯覓致若干共同諒解之基礎。土耳其海峽問題使英國必須在兩種途徑中有所取捨，其一，即認蘇聯為可能的敵人，增強美蘇之聯繫，摒絕蘇聯於韃靼海峽及整個中東以外，並保持在土耳其之飛機塲。另一途徑即對於一大陵國家覓至諒解的基礎，促進英蘇關係，而依照一九一五年條約之規定，解決土耳其海峽問題，以上兩種途徑必居其一，英內閣倘曾於一星期以前討論此一問題，則英駐埃談判代表史坦斯加特殆將參加，似無疑義。當此時也，貝文外相接到法外長皮杜爾，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫，及美國務卿貝爾納斯出席四外長緊急會議之通吿，因此，貝文仍留巴黎，史坦斯加特仍留埃及，英內閣會議亦吿延擱。要之，現在種種理由，相信蘇聯已決定鄭重硏究此一問題，惟其如此，莫洛托夫乃返莫斯科請訓，英蘇關係之促進，厥惟此行結果是賴云。</p>
<h3>美加聯防北極加緊工作中　雙方軍隊將續行廣泛北極演習</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山五日廣播：據華盛頓可靠方面消息，美國與加拿大之總參謀長，正加緊進行防禦工作，以防來自北極方面之襲擊，長距離飛行機之日新月異，使北極方面之防禦日趨重要。美加軍隊，將繼續舉行廣泛之北極演習。蒙哥馬利元帥於九月間訪問華府時，大致將與艾森豪威爾將軍討論北極聯防。自本星期六起B—一一九型轟炸機將自夏威夷起飛，越北極而達開羅，此點更足以顯示北極防禦之重要。美國海軍已派潛水艇與航空母艦駛往北極方海面，探測海洋情形。據稱：美國B—三六型新式轟炸機之飛行範圍，達一萬英里。茍此等飛機以阿拉斯加為根據地，即可向歐亞兩洲北部在任何一地出擊，同時類似之大型飛機，亦可自歐亞兩洲北部，經北極而向美國與加拿大出擊。</p>

<h3>王外長在巴黎談話　主張里比亞獨立　締造和平安全須具更大信心</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎四日電〕中國外長王世杰，今晚在此間招待各報記者，表示相信巴黎和會，必能成功。其言略謂：巴黎和會雖發生各種辯論與爭議，但相信和會必能成功，余認為吾人對於締造世界和平與安全，必須有更大之信心。尤其是締造對德日兩國之和約，更為重要。除非在此和會閉幕之後，立即作重大之努力，造成列強間之友好空氣。否則余不信列強對於此二軸心國之和約，能獲致協議。中國在此次和會中，旣不要求領土，亦不要求賠款，但對於義國殖民地之處置，曾提出一項建議。茲戰勝的聯合國各國代表，聚首於一堂，以決定戰敗國殖民地在法理上之地位，此在近代歷史上實為創舉。和會必須使世界明瞭義國舊有殖民地，應置於為當地居民所能接受之政府統治之下，姑以里比亞而論，中國代表團提議應立即使其獨立，如不可能，則應置於聯合國機構託管之下。如若各國同意後者，則應決定託管期限，如此可不致重蹈昔日國聯委任統治制之覆轍。是以中國代表已向對義領土及政治委會提出建議，相信聯合國憲章所規定之託管制基本原則，必能對里比亞實施，和會最好能吿知該地居民，和會對於渠輩之利益及願望，已認為處理義大利舊有殖民地之基本條件。此種態度，在世界各國視之，足以目為聯合國各國對殖民地問題，所採之政策。對於義大利以前所有殖民地，當然不能採取一種類似的解決辦法。但吾人亦不能否認事實，即里比亞與其他殖民地相較，已為開發至相當程度之殖民地。是以中國代表要求和會向外長會議提出下列各項建議，（一）對義和約必須規定里比亞立即獨立。（二）如此項建議不能為各國所接受，則將里比亞提交聯合國機構託管若干年，但聯合國機構必須保證里比亞至託管期滿之後，宣吿其獨立。</p>
<h3>特港問題三項建議</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎四日電〕巴黎和會之義大利政治及經濟委員會，今日辯論最棘手之特里埃斯特問題時，所接到之具體建議共有三則，（一）伊斯特利亞西部國際化，（二）再設專家委員會提出新方案，（三）建議之劃界辦法再予修正，以求里齊亞城劃分入南國。結果尚未就該三項成立決議。第一項係南菲所提，以該處居民大多係義人之故，英法表示贊成，惟白俄羅斯表示反對，認為不應剝奪南國適當之出海口，蓋四強原建議以該地　南故也。其第二項建議，係巴西代表方杜拉所提，認為現有方案不能令任何一方滿意，並謂再維持現狀一年，足以危害該處和平。第三項建議係白俄羅斯代表基斯洛夫所提，渠謂該城週圍均係斯拉夫人所居，義人故意集居城內。在休會之前，貝爾納斯之顧問參議員康納利曾　請各代表以世界和平為念。</p>
<p>和會軍事委會今日完成限制義陸海空軍條文之硏究，暫時通過防止義協助德日兩國重整軍備之條款。</p>
<h3>保擴土要求</h3>
<p>希代表嚴辭反駁</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎四日電〕保加利亞政治及領土委會今日開會時，希臘代表　　奈　　嚴辭反駁保加利亞之要求取得西色雷斯，指出此乃保國擴張主義之又一證明。不料保國於戰敗之翌日，竟利用准其列席和會陳述意見之機會，要求分割盟國之一，此誠一種重要之警吿，使吾人永勿遺忘。若准如所請，則廿五萬之希臘人及一千名之土耳其人，在保國　政之下，勢須出亡矣，保和約第一條已將肥沃之　國土地給予保國，茍希臘之合法要求得到滿足，希臘準備支持該條規定。至於希臘之要求調整希保疆界，係基於國防上之必要，蓋希臘曾三次受保侵略也。保加利亞掩護德軍之南翼，可謂有殊功於希特勒，當保軍佔希時，有十萬人被迫離家，猶太人被逐者五千零四十八人，歸來者僅一百廿二名。希臘東部與保接壤處之狹長地帶，為歐洲最軟弱之部份，保國得於八天之內集中軍隊，以發動侵略。軍略上之高地悉在保國境內，侵略者可不費事而佔領薩隆尼加，切斷希軍後路，此一九四一年德軍侵希時之情形也，委員會至此決定週五　論此一問題。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓四日電〕代理國務卿克萊頓今日在記者會席上談稱：「因南斯拉夫襲擊美機而死難之人員共五人。昨日美方曾以照會致南國，結束美南兩國趨於此項事件之文件往返，對於此一照會，克萊頓認為南國之賠償問題如能解決，此事即可吿一段落。渠指出蒂托元帥對美方之生命損失已示歉意，並保證不再射擊越境飛機，甚至各機未能按照信號指示飛行，亦不得予以射擊。記者詢以蒂托元帥如拒絕賠償，局勢又將如何？克萊頓謂：渠希望此一問題將獲滿意之解決，希望此事無須第三者出面調停。克氏並謂：國務院將與各機起飛地區之美軍當局會商，俾於短期內擬就賠償單。記者詢以美對擬議中之蘇聯瑞典貿易協定之意見如何？克氏謂：美對此一擬議中之協定，並無任何新舉動，前此美照會述及兩國之動機，純綷出自加強多角性貿易之意旨，蓋美國原擬在世界各地普遍建立此項貿易關係也。</p>

<h3>前法公董局　被隱匿地產總值二千億　偽府盜賣五十一畝　决予公吿無價收回</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於前法駐滬領事館隱匿前法公董局公有地產事，記者昨自有關方面探得詳情如下：法租界存在時，法公董局所有地產，據一九四一年該局刋佈之土地册中所載，共一千零零八畝餘。但勝利後我地政局自僞政府方面接收所得之前法公董局地產僅六百三十四畝餘。其間相差之三百餘畝，早經我地政當局淸查明白，計其中二七二畝餘，係僞政府接收法租界時，法方隱匿未予移交。五十一畝餘已由僞市府出售。另五十六畝餘則係法維琪政府所出售。據悉，僞府出售地產之承購者，名義上雖係普通市民，實際上幕後人物係當時與僞府有往來之某地產鉅商及陳逆璧君。現此項僞府處分之產權轉讓，已由行政院規定一律認爲無效，聞地政局即將於短期內公吿無價收回。至於維琪政府出售之地產，經市府向行政院請示結果，規定在三十一年僞市府成立以前轉讓者有效，以後者無效。惟事實上此筆總値約三百億元之地產，大部均係三十一年前所出售。至法領事館隱匿之地產總値，約在一千億元以上，近二千億元。其隱匿之方式殊爲巧妙，例如復興公園與其後而公園之土地原有契據三紙，共一百四十餘畝，而當初法領館竟將該項契據隱匿，僅蔣公國部份一百三十六畝另出一權柄單移交偽方，又有若干產業則推稱已由公董局售與法政府。現地政局雖已調查淸楚，惟因此事有關兩國外交未能遽然處置云。</p>
<h3>美法庭鞫審兩戰犯　虐待戰俘手段毒辣　零度下迫令立正　害盲腸不上麻藥</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕虐待美軍俘虜之前長春日方戰俘管理處主任松田上校及醫官川島上尉，昨由美軍法庭提審，兩犯對於是否自認有罪一節，與以往「荷克案」各犯如出一轍，均答稱「無罪」。</p>
<p>檢察官威廉，福勒中尉指稱，當時長春俘虜營中美俘備受虐待，其中一百四十人均身罹重疾，而此種疾病實係可以預防者，營中對於俘虜不予防空設備，致有美官兵二十四人於轟炸中罹難。松田上校行爲暴虐，某次於視察時，曾令美兵於戶外零度下之氣候下作長時間之立正。不少俘虜偶有不合，即遭禁閉，概不加以審詢。俘虜中有柏萊蒂上尉等三人，因擬越獄被捕後，竟遭槍決，松田應負此罪行之責任。川島上尉則身爲醫官，而忽視其責任，某次爲考萊上尉割治盲腸炎，竟不上麻藥，考萊呻吟呼痛時，反遭辱罵。</p>
<p>被吿辯護人雷芒，福勒巾尉及兩日籍律師，要求庭上將兩被吿分別審問，並擬請日政府以書面證明同意日內瓦戰俘公的，此項要求均遭駁斥。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市中心區·滬東·滬西等大小米店七百卅餘家從業員四千餘人，因要求改善待遇事，昨晨十時起一律開始罷工，至晚仍在繼續中。社會局得訊，即召集勞資雙方進行調解，並諭勞方先行復工。聞勞方決於今晨九時先行復工。昨深夜米糧業從業員協會，猶在古拔路召開緊急會議。緣米糧業職員待遇素低，平均月入僅四萬餘元。故於八月上旬，由從業員協會代表向資方提出改善待遇要求，曾經社會局調解，按月加發米四斗。原定十六日雙方簽訂調解筆錄，届時資方要求延至九月二日，嗣又延至三日。但資方始終避不出席簽訂。其時又有豆米雜糧職工會出現，資方即以協會與職工會兩者性質相同，不知與何者爲簽訂筆錄對象爲詞，延不簽訂。乃引起此次工潮。現悉資方已允今晨與協會簽訂調解筆錄並立即實行云。</p>

<h3>一區四參議員　公開徵詢民意　大會擬改在逸園舉行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市第一區參議員馬君碩·李文杰·董幹文·洪福楣等四人，昨日下午在金門飯店招待該區區公所長官，各保保長，區民代表等，公開徵集民意，以便在大會中提出。到屠開徵·應書貴·金潤庠等約五十人。由馬君碩任主席。先由李文杰致詞略稱：第一區爲全上海工商金融重心所在，責任重大，自不待言。今市參議會即將舉行，對於市政設施，市民理應關切。我人今後應如何負起責任，而使上海成爲全國模範都市，配合建國需要。繼由第一區區長程經遠表示保甲組織應嚴密，職標需劃分，經費當確立，吾則有此機構，僅具虛名，反而影響工作推進。其他區　　　　稱，　　　　　出。市政設施應重實際，脚踏實地去做，僅　表面，無濟於事。馬君碩並報吿巳具之提案二則：（一）加强保甲組織，以利自治進行。其辦法爲提高保甲人員素質，增加保甲經費，經速達到保甲人員由民選，保民大會希能按期開會，每保設合作社，保國民學校，視地方環境分別設立。（二）關於提審法，請市府轉呈行政院通令全國各軍警機關切實辦理，並分別函令本市各軍警機關切實辦理。</p>

<h3>市政諮議會　是否仍存在</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市參議會成立後，對於上海市政府市政　議委員會是否繼續存在，頗爲一般人所關心，記者特爲此事走訪有關當局，據稱：該會爲一純粹之諮詢顧問機關，並非正式民意機構，委員人數共計十四人，中西各半，該會對市政問題，僅互相交換意見，並不能作正式之決議，與市參議會之　權與性質，絕無抵觸之處云。</p>
<h3>市府如准恢復賽馬　月可收入五億四千　但看參議會能否通過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕靜安寺路跑馬廳恢復賽馬之說，甚囂塵上，雖尙須待市參議會通過，然似已得當局之默契。據跑馬廳負責人語本報記者，市財政局曾與該廳西籍主持人沃森作非正式交換意見，賽馬實行之時，在全部票款中，抽取百分之四十，其中百分之二十歸市庫，百分之二十則作塲中之收入。據估計以每次營業三億元，一月賽馬九次計算，市府每月當可收入五億四千萬元之譜。然以賽馬散失（原有五百匹，現僅存一百五十匹），塲地損壞，故市參議會即能予以通過，其正式賽馬之期，當須在兩月之後。又跑馬廳徇各方面要求，願以中問空塲出租，以供運動之思，如欲作爲網球足球場者，可向該塲當局接洽。</p>
<h3>定海接收物資不無可疑處　縣警曾與海軍發生火併三戰區方面清册亦不全　吳望伋談　杭州之行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕清查團吳委員望伋已於昨日自杭返滬，記者往詢此行經過，及淸查團赴杭工作重心。據吿：淸查團赴杭，有兩大目標：一，定海方面，海軍司令部所接收者。該一區所藏軍火·輜重·物資極多，因敵人投降前，曾積極經營，擬作爲對抗盟軍自沿岸登陸之根據地。且聞海軍司令部前往接收時，曾與定海縣政府警察開火，其中不無可疑之處，故淸查團赴杭後，必轉定海一行。其二，爲第三戰區方而所接收者，因該區物資，最初皆由三戰區接收，其後輾轉由其他各機關接收，目前各方面接收時之案卷報吿，雖多已送來，但原好淸册，頗有缺漏不全者。</p>
<p>淸查團張團長知本及張委員慶楨定於本月九日赴杭，吳委員望伋則早一二日前往佈置，在杭調查時間，的爲一星期至十天。</p>
<p>淸查團在杭州方而早已設立收件處，但密吿信件極少。</p>
<p>敵偽產業處理局駐杭辦事處下波·溫州。已拍賣之物資，迄目，共設四分處：嘉興·紹興·寗前爲止，四分處不足二十五億，　　　　　　　　　。</p>
<p>淸查團第二組，已自京赴蘇州。第三組，負責淸查安慶。徐州方面，似尙未啓程。</p>
<p>吳委員稱二淸查團赴杭後，上海方面新案件或於本月九日，至　本月十五日停止收受。但一切未結束案件，仍將繼續辦理，至於隱匿逃避之敵僞物資，日前查到　尙不多云。</p>

<h3>榮德生滿不在乎？廿四萬美金屢催未領　準備全部捐出</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕　　　案抄獲之贓款，警備司令部前已通知榮於昨日下午三時前往該部軍法處領取，但「棉紗麵粉大王」對於收回其失去之款項，，似並不感多大興趣，因至下午六時下辦公時止，榮旣米親自前來，亦未派人代領。承辦本案之軍法處朱科長曾四度電話「催駕」，第一次在四時五十五分，打至榮宅，接電話者自稱係茶房，謂所有榮家老小均在「一五七七四」恒豐紗廠，朱科長乃轉撥該號碼詢問，則接聽者係一老司務，據說榮等剛巧離廠返家。至五時十分再電榮宅，則謂仍未歸來，最後一次電話在五時二十五分打去，始由一榮姓家人接聽，答稱上午已派人至警備司令部來過，惟係至稽查處有所接洽，款項擬於明日來領云。當時辦公廳某秘書在旁，即接過電話，堅囑其必須當日來領，但直至下辦公鐘聲「噹噹」響時，堆積於軍法處長辦公桌上之纍纍美鈔法幣黃金等，猶未得見其「故主」。軍法處內因無保險箱，祗得派員夜間在室內看守，而對於榮氏之「滿不在乎」，均深感不滿。</p>
<p>發還之贓款總數，前報載爲美金二十四萬餘元，，實際上其中僅一部份係美鈔，餘者係黃金法幣等折合之數。詳確數字尙待今日公佈。昨日警察局方面派偵緝科科長馮起汕率同科員張長貴等三人，將該局抄獲部份携至警備部點交軍法處，計美鈔六萬七千四百元，法幣四百六十萬元，三粒鑚黃金戒一只，足赤金手鐲一只，金脚鐲一只，女式洋金十八K手表一只，足赤金戒六只，金耳環一付，ELBA手表一只，洋金別針一只，洋金圈一只。</p>
<p>據悉，榮家表示，領回此項贓款後，將全部分別捐作軍警機關福利基金及救濟難民之用。</p>
<h3>路員監守自盜　偵查已獲線索　馮振邦與雷姓挾貨潛逃　津浦路局懸賞五十萬元通緝</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕京滬津浦兩路客貨聯運，近發生押貨員監守自盜事件，按鐵道信譽素著，此種事件尙屬初次發生，故鐵路當局極爲重視。對在逃之津浦路押貨員馮振邦已懸賞五十萬元嚴緝。緣上月初，有本市布商陳百川，有棉布十八件，委託路局聯運至徐州，擬再轉隴海路運陝西，貨至徐州後，因隴海路中斷，無法前進，故於同月二十二日，將該項棉布交徐州站聯運回滬，即由五十一次車載運南下，押貨員爲津浦路車務組之馮齡邦。該車於二十四日到滬後，經滬北站行李房點收時，短少棉布十二件，當時押貨員馮振邦即稱，其餘十二件下次車可裝到，並簽授受證稱「棉布十二件待運」。分枇運載，原爲常有之事，故北站行李房不疑、　　　　　　，　　　　，　上北童總站長電徐州站查詢，始發覺馮振邦監守自盜。現兩路局已派稽查向佩玉，津浦路派稽查孫樹仁，李廣惠，分別在京滬徐各處進行偵查，昨悉此案業巳獲得綫索，該項貨物係馮串通徐州行李房職員雷某，冒充貨主，僞造「自理包裹票，」在南京站提去。馮雷兩人現皆在逃。唯津浦路任用職員，向係採取三人聯保制，故保馮之兩職員，已經扣押，　　　　　　　。至　　　　　之棉布十二件。計女式悅新纔一件（二十六疋）。美　呢五件（各二十六疋）。國光呢二件（各二十二疋）。國光呢六疋，美華呢六疋，吉普呢十疋（合爲一件）。吉普呢一件（二十疋）。元直貢呢一件（十疋）。格子呢一件（三十疋）。以上共計棉布十二件（二百八十二疋）。上項損失，決先由津浦路當局負責賠償云。</p>
<h3>美國醫藥助華會　今後主要目的　訓練醫藥人才</h3>
<p>現有五十人正在受訓　史蒂文斯談此行任務</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕美國醫藥助華會總幹事史蒂文斯女士於週前由美來滬，昨午在江西路該會辦事處招待記者，女士稱：渠此次來華，並未準備極多計劃，乃欲光與中國醫藥界各方領袖及中國人民多多接觸，而尋找中國目前急需及待解決之困難何在，然後共同硏討辦法。　美國醫藥助華會名譽會長爲蔣宋美齡女士，該會在戰時，曾以大量醫藥物品及設備救濟中國軍隊，現大戰結束，以後決繼續爲中國人民服務。史女士又稱：該會紐的總會工作人員，半數爲華人，此機關亦可謂爲中美合作之機構。目前供應物品尙不多，其主要目的，乃在訓練中國醫藥人才。現有五十華人正在美國受訓，其中有專家，護士，及硏究各種學術者。</p>
<p>史女士對於公共衛生允爲注意，謂：威爾基氏所作「天下一家」中會說過：「健康重於一切」。史女士又吿渠此次由美來華僅飛行五十四時，由此亦可想見病菌傳染之易。史女士對於本市撲滅霍亂運動備加贊揚，謂此病恐怖異常，而能加以控制，實非易事。</p>
<p>史女士定今日飛北平視察行政院衛生署防疫委員會籌備之配尼西林產塲，該塲定於雙十節成立。然後再轉南京至蘭州，視察蘭州護士學校，繼赴貴陽，昆明，廣州各地，約定十一月初返國報吿結果並籌劃工作計劃，以備明年來華大規模進行。</p>

<h3>徵收各類所得稅　應依新稅法辦理</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市商會頃率眞核稅局轉到財部直接稅署代電內開：「查所得稅法修正公佈後，所有各類所得稅之征收，自應依照實施要點之規定辦理。廿朱依照新稅法要點辦理者，應即分別辦理退稅或補稅，以符規定，仰即遵照」等語。市商會當據情分函各業公會轉知所屬會員一體遵辦。</p>
<h3>本市營業牌照稅　征收範圍將重訂</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市各業商號之營業牌照稅問題，最近曾經市商會秘書長嚴諤聲與財政局長谷春帆商談，應納牌照稅各業，其稅率係根據資本額千分之五征收，如遇資本額難於估計，或難於調查者。會經市政會議議決，得比照上期執照費率計算征收，惟征收範圍，雖前經財政部核准增添，各業迄未領照繳稅。近聞中央有將前頒稅法，於最近期內重行改訂之說，届時本市營業牌照征收範圍，自當重行改訂。</p>

<h3>聞蘭亭扶病受審　答問寥寥數語頻頻點首　出任偽職自稱奉命辦理　一聲爺爺老淚縱橫　庭上賜坐倒茶一杯　辯論終結　十二日宣判</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕問蘭亭漢奸嫌疑案，高院於昨日上午九時四十五分開合議庭審理。被吿由法警攙扶出監，到庭答問，（見圖本報攝）但僅寥寥數語，未作多言。並由江庸，朱扶九，沙彦楷三律師爲之辯護。審訊至十一時十分終結，庭諭本月十二日上午九時半宣判。</p>
<p>彼吿昨衣藍綢長衫，內襯白短衫褲，足穿淺褐色紗襪，白底黑鞋，鼻架無邊眼鏡，手特摺扇，鬢髮斑白，鬚長及胸。因年老力衰，精神不佳，又兼患病在身，故由法警兩名攙扶，步出忠字監，後隨法醫兩名，時爲九時二十五分。先至候審室稍事休息。其孫即上前握手問候，叫聲「爺爺」間及「身體好不好」時，被吿觸景生情，滿腔辛酸，無從作答，久久始梗咽道出「好，好」兩字，言罷即揮手示去。待其孫拭淚黯然離室後，乃除下眼鏡，自袋中掬出手帕，揩去老淚。消瘦多縐之雙手，顫抖不已。</p>
<p>九時四十五分，劉毓桂庭長偕曹駿邱煥　兩推事，檢察官葉于紹及書記官蒞庭升座，即命法警提被吿到庭，仍由兩人攙扶而上，法醫隨侍在側，以防不測。劉庭長首詢法醫被吿病狀如何，答稱患陰囊浮腫，脚氣及心臟病等症，劉庭長乃命法警備椅置於被吿欄旁，後又倒茶一杯，令被吿坐下後，即開始詢問，首問聞蘭亭七十七歲，武進人，住西愛咸斯路，前在上海證券交易所任理事，是不是？被吿於每句問後，點一點頭，不作多言。劉庭長繼請檢察官葉于紹起立陳述起訴要旨，略稱：被吿於民國卅一年參加僞組織，担任僞上海市商會監事長，民國卅二年僞商統會成立，代敵統制搜購各項物資，被吿出任該會監事長，卅三年七月又繼唐壽民出任理事長，同時兼任僞棉統會主任委員，代敵收買棉紗，又任僞上海市民衆福利協會理事長，勸募防空捐款，供敵偽利用，故依法提起公訴。</p>
<p>逐一詢問點頭作答</p>
<p>劉庭長即根據檢察官所舉被吿歷年來所任之僞職，逐一詢問。被吿或以點頭作答，或稱「對」或祗答一「是」。庭上乃問：你對於担任這些偽職，有什麼話說。被吿即起立稱有三點聲明：（一）本人不承認通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國，更不承認是漢奸。（二）本人所祖任偽職事務，事先係奉中央命令，事後亦隨時秉承中央之意志辦理。（三）本人在福履理路軍統局之一切口供，及自白書，係出於環境所逼迫，故應作無效。今欲說之話，皆在辯訴狀上，可請公判，言畢坐下。</p>
<p>心跳有病還是不講</p>
<p>庭上乃問：答辯是跟狀子一樣嗎？答：一樣。問：軍統局之筆錄你不承認，現在不妨將實情簡單講一講。答：請庭上原諒，我還是不講，因心跳厲害，有病。至此辯護律師朱扶九起立稱：被吿與前江蘇省代主席李明揚有軍事情報上之聯絡，曾由第三戰區吳是沂於上次到庭證明。後王懋功繼李明揚出長江蘇，繼續聘請被吿担任顧問，此係勝利前之事，有聘書可證。庭上即以此聘書出示被吿問：對嗎？答：對的。又問：上次黃涵之到庭證明你曾辦許多慈善事業，如難民收容所，傷兵醫院等，都不錯嗎？答：這是應盡之責，有的。問：淪陷期間在滬幹特務地下工作之戚再玉等上次到庭證明你曾對他們營救過：答：不祗一次。</p>
<p>担任偽職謂有默契</p>
<p>問：中統局曾有公函給江律師，證明你對地下工作人員曾有掩護，同時說你担任偽職，事先曾向中統局取得聯絡，有沒有這事？答：有的。從前我不敢說，現在他們旣出來說，我亦不賴，是有的。至此朱律師又起立補充稱：並非取得聯絡，而係出任僞職事先備案。庭上　問被吿：勞敬修，徐寄廎，顏惠慶等，具狀本院稱你在僞職時曾掩護工作並與敵僞消極不合作，道事有麼？答：我在裏面（指獄中）不知。又問：紗廠同業公會聯合會具狀本院稱被敵所封紗廠，經你折衝，得以發還，後敵人又欲搬遝廠內機器，亦經你加以維護，得以保全，這事都有的？答：事實。問：本院吊到僞商統會常務委員會會議記錄，計自卅三年八月至卅四年八月，共開會二十七次，內有收買及配給等方案之記錄，都有你簽的字，你看一看是不是？被吿看後，答稱：是。</p>
<p>不承認但亦不否認</p>
<p>庭上又問：本院還吊着僞新中國報及偽申報，你在僞商統會理事長任時，在「大東亞戰爭週年紀念會」及「國府還都週年紀念會」席上，皆有演詞談話發表，對於這些，你有什麼話說？答：對此我不可承認，亦不可否認。報紙要登，我不可叫他不登。但平時我不多說話是事實。繼之朱律師又以徐采丞之證明信一件呈於庭上稱：被吿於卅三年七月一日出任偽商統會理事長，但在五六兩月間，已奉中統局之命，加緊阻止統制，六月廿二日並由徐采丞直接打電報報告委員長云。</p>
<p>葉檢察官起立論吿</p>
<p>至此劉庭長即稱案情已極明瞭，即開始辯論，先請檢察官論吿。葉檢察官即起立聲稱：僞全國商業統制會爲敵人在我國統制物資之最高機構，被吿先後歷任該會之監事長及理事長，又兼僞棉紗統制會主任委員，代敵搜括物資，據調查偽行政院曾下令僞商統會先後收買軍米二百萬祖及棉紗五萬多件，被吿又任僞上海市民衆福利協會理事長，籌募防空捐僞幣十萬萬元，並屢次發表媚敵談話，實屬甘心附逆無疑，應請庭上處以應得之罪云。</p>
<p>辯護律師分別答辯</p>
<p>庭上繼請被吿之辯護律師答辯，江庸·朱扶九·沙彦楷三律師乃分別就法律事實及是非三點，逐一答辯。略謂：本案被吿上海人對之無一不知，生平剛正非常，自奉淸廉，數十年來襄助革命，服務社會，可說完全爲公，不爲自己。因剛正之故，被吿對別人所作有益之事，不願說出，上次到庭爲被吿作有利證明之人，皆係自動前來，並非出於被吿之自稱或要求。被吿係受中央之命出任僞職，今不爲外界所瞭解，受刺激太深，故雖有種種有利證明，被吿亦不願多說。去年在軍統局問話時，亦不講什麼，該局之筆錄，前後矛盾甚多，自白書亦係由人代筆，被吿在軍統局之一切口供，自白書，筆錄等完全非其本人意思，故不能承認。上次曾有軍統局戚再王，第三戰區吳是沂等到庭證明曾經被吿營救，實際上經被吿營救之地下工作人員太多，表面有一二百人，間接者有幾千人。張小通烈士之父張叔通，亦曾得被吿之掩護，而被吿本人曾因之被敵憲兵隊傳詢，威逼供出張之住址，但始終未說，如言被吿通謀敵國，則當時又爲何不向敵憲說出？被吿在上海辦事，係奉中央之命，參加任何團體偽職，皆會事先備案。李明揚代江蘇省主席時，其上海辦事處之電台，即設於被吿家中。故至王懋功出長江蘇仍繼續聘請被吿担任顧問。卅三年七月一日，被吿出任偽商統會理事長，事先會奉命設法阻止商業統制，紗布收買係卅二年之事，時被吿尙任僞監事長，不負實際責任，而此事亦非僞棉統會所收買，而由僞商統會屬下之紗布收買處所負責。至言以米二百萬担供敵，此爲僞米統會之事，而此一百萬二百萬担等亦皆爲空言，並無實據。至言防空捐，因空襲之下，死者多爲中國人，用以救濟災民，並非用以製造高射砲或飛機對抗盟機者。參加各種「紀念會」，發表談話事，或係記載不實，而被吿身負掩護之資，如不參加，則亦不成其爲掩護。卅四年二月江蘇第三區行政專員兼保安司令謝承勛來滬與任援道周佛海等接洽反正，被吿亦參與其事，今事後聽從之任援道身爲堂堂政府官員，而負策反之責之問蘭亭，倒要負罪，此事還請庭上要硏究研究。總之被吿凡有利於人民之事，說做就做，不利於人民之事絕對不做。無論在行爲上法律上講來，被吿並無假借敵僞勢力作不利於本國之行爲，而是假借敵僞勢力作有利於本國之行爲，故不能稱彼吿爲通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國，而應稱爲通謀本國，圖謀反抗敵國。被吿爲敵國之漢奸，僞政府之漢奸，而非本國之漢奸。現今不是事實問題，不是法律問題，而爲是非之分的問題，請庭上明辨是非，予被吿以無罪之判決云。</p>
<p>點頭揮手黯然道別</p>
<p>辯論終結後，庭上又問被吿：再有什麼話講？答稱：沒有話講，請庭上公判。劉庭長即宣佈本案定於本月十二日上午九時半宣判，言畢退庭。時爲十一時十分。被吿起立向其家屬親友點頭揮手，黯然道別，仍由法警攙扶還押忠字監。</p>

<h3>漢奸家屬的留生活費　高院已决定執行辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕勝利後各地法院判決之漢奸，其全部財產除酌留家屬必需生活費外沒收一語。「酌留」兩字究作如何解釋，當局迄未明文規定。為此安徽等地之法院曾向司法行政部請求解釋，但至今未聞有何答覆。茲悉上海高等法院對此已確定辦法，即將該漢奸被封之財產拍賣後，按照社會上一般普通生活情形，將其中一部份撥付家屬。此事現已由高檢處負責執行辦理。</p>
<h3>水上機關名目多　水上治安問題多</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕最近黃浦江上「黃牛黨」極爲活躍，行旅引以爲苦。江面治安情形不佳之最大癥結，實由於駢枝機關太多，職權未能統一之故。據悉，負責維持市區四十華里水程間之治安者，有六個機關之多，即（一）水上警察分局，（二）港口警察，（三）淞滬警備司令部水上稽查所，（四）憲兵團，（五）「行總」警衛組，（六）「行總」所用之請願警。日前吳市長曾召集有關方面商討改善辦法，但未得具體結果。記者昨晤警察局某高級人員，據稱：欲改善水上治安，最好將此六單位加以合併，旣使職權統一，又可節省經費。現時水上警察分局內外勤職員僅一百三十餘人，分三班値勤，故平時出動警員，至多三十餘人，自屬不够，如能成立一擴大之新組織，並增加刑事及外事警察，祖任緝查盜匪烟毒及檢查旅客護照工作，相信水上治安情形，必可大爲改善云。</p>

<h3>紗布走私問題　管理出口未奉令　華南申請之配紗達八成　紡建已配未出者四千件</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨訪中國舫建公司副總經理吳味經，叩詢紗布由華南轉口走私實况。據稱：紗布走私之事，雖時有所聞，惟因無法確切統計，故未能言其實况。然近來越南各地紗布行市熱烈，廿支紗每件折合法幣達三百萬元，普通漂布每疋折合法幣達十二萬元以上。利之所在，走私自所難免。又證以近來各方向紗廠聯合配銷機構由請配紗，出口至華南者，竟佔百分之八十。以華南之紗在加工工業言，似亦無如此　大之需要量。其過剩者，難免不通過香港澳門等地，而流向南洋各地。現紡織事業管委會對此事雖有草擬管理辦法之訊，惟尙未奉到行政院訓令。據吳氏意見，管理紗布出口辦法，最好應稍具彈性。以視國內對紗布之實際供需，而決定其出口之可否。例如紗爲原料，國內需要孔殷，目前當毋需考慮出口。惟布類成品中，南洋最暢銷之花色布。本市現感剩餘，不妨可考慮出口多少。以維持國內一般印染工業，及其員工之生活。至於本市棉紗之供應，實際上亦感有多無缺。以紡建而言，現尙有已配售之棉紗四千餘件，迄未見客戶前往出淸。此中細紗，且多至八百餘件。可見本市對棉紗之需要，決不如一般所傳之股切也。</p>
<h3>市場交易清淡　雙馬黑市再降</h3>
<p>紗布市價，較日昨趨耿，龍頭細布，成交六萬四千五百元，嘩嘰六萬元，其他各貨，成交甚少，紡建開盤仍照原價，廠號前往請購者，亦不若上届之踴躍，紗市，雙馬初開一百五十萬，後降至一百四十一二萬，雜牌貨亦退至一百三十萬元左右，除熱門貨之四十二支藍鳳仍站住二百十四萬外，其他四十二支實光，僅做二百零八萬，尙少成交，至三十二支仙桃筒管，則竟乏人問津，察其疲軟原因，自爲時届節關，銀根續緊所致，再廣帮向有大量吸收，近亦受限制，與市而以影響不少，據業中人云，最近該帮復有鉅額款項匯到，一面已有多家向關務署申請出口，將來或有一部份紗布，可望獲准南運，但預計時期，當在節後矣。</p>
<p>又訊紡建公司，對於各廠號申請登記之登記卡，業已停止收受，同時幷將前經登記核准開貨者，亦在詳加審核，切實整理，其於販賣商號，以及外埠客帮之開貨資格，亦在重行甄別，廠家則調查其生產能力，以定開貨標準，務使開貨者，得其所需，市價得以平定云。</p>
<h3>大批棉布運粵</h3>
<p>聞係海關布吿以前報裝〔本報訊〕招商局培德輪今日駛粵，運去棉布六千五百件。江慶輪今晨駛渝，裝棉花六百十餘件運重慶。昨據航業界訊，海關昨日通吿，禁止棉紗棉布運往華南，廣東·汕頭·厦門·福州等七口岸，又據華南帮客商稱，關於昨日海關布吿禁止棉紗棉布出口輸華南事，與客商並不妨礙，其禁運之目的，在於杜絕走私，因自本年一月十九日，海關第二十五號布吿，禁止棉紗棉布出口，運往外洋一節後，廣州方面偸運出境者，逐漸增多，致本市南運之棉紗棉布，不斷大量運去，價格亦因之漸見上升，又悉走私均含投機性；並由有惡勢力者所爲，對於正當客商，仍可向目的地海關申請，如得證明書，依舊可採購運輸，僅手續上稍有麻煩而已。至培德輪今日運粵之棉布，係在海關布吿之前所報裝，故可運出。</p>
<h3>金鈔由穩轉疲</h3>
<p>烚赤昨復吿下游，晨開二〇五萬光景·高價曾喊二〇六萬，中央銀行壓力復加，漲勢吿止，漸漸盤小，十時後中央銀行以二〇四萬七五之價，配給一七四條，此復逐漸由平和趨人疲軟，近午盤低至二〇一萬五，午刻站定於二〇二萬外，午後即交已穩，隔日交割更升至二〇四萬五左右，結果較前收跌一萬，飾金紋銀銀元均平，暗拆銀根不定，息價自一角半至二角不等。</p>
<p>外幣由穩步疲，美鈔自三三〇〇元賣價起，逐漸盤低，金市重疲，近午退至三二四〇元左右，始稍見回，午後隨金市同吿回升，最後復追近三三〇〇元關，結果與前收相彷彿，港票由平而疲，低價曾退至六七〇元左右，而後稍穩，結果較前收跌十元，港匯因道亨被停業，經營者不無顧慮，買戶觀望，退爲六八〇元至六九〇元，印匯八四〇元，英匯一一二五〇元，美匯牌價，均有供少求。</p>
<p>〔路透社香港四日電〕今日港匯開盤爲港幣一四·五元對法幣一萬元。</p>
<h3>多頭見風轉舵　統債步下跌</h3>
<p>公債多頭終告不支，統丙晨開已退至二二〇〇元，高價二二六〇元，即遭多頭斬殺，逐漸下游，二千元大關，不久即被打破，中途降至一七八〇元低價，始有補空維持，臨收在一八五〇元左右掙扎，結果較前收下挫五七〇元，甲乙跌落二五〇元，丁種小三五〇元，統戊亦跌三〇〇元，證交對統債暫不開拍，人心不定。</p>
<h3>麥加利　發臨時紅利</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦四日電〕麥加利銀行頃宣佈發給臨時紅利三分半，扣除捐稅。按上决發給之紅利爲二分半。</p>
<h3>道亨實行清理　自辯疏導僑匯有功　呈請財部收回成命</h3>
<p>本市寗波路四九號道亨銀行，頃以違背管理外匯法令，私營外匯業務，從中套利，財政部巳勒令停業淸理，昨探悉該行昨日起，已將上海分行停止收款，照常支付，實行淸理，同時並列舉各種事實，呈請財政部收回成命，該行經理董幹文發表談話，據稱：木號於民國十年在香港設立，專營代理僑胞匯兌業務，曾向中央銀行申請爲指定銀行，未邀裁覆，然本號在港方各聯號握有大批港匯頭寸，隨時匯向國內乃委託本號純爲代理性質，並無私自經營情事，統計木號所出售外匯，除少數私人生活費用外，以購買輪船機器棉花顏料及工業原料等爲限，故本行經營外匯，不特無擾亂金融之意向，且對國計民生裨益甚大，試觀過去凡遇市面外匯過分漲動時，本號即有大量外匯頭寸放售，以供正當進口商人之需求，外匯市價，往往因此壓平，華僑持有外匯，如無本號爲之疏導宣洩，因而流注入於投機商人之手，其對余融之弊害，恐更不堪設想，茲除呈請收回成命外，暫將上海本號淸理，以符功令云。</p>
<h3>人造絲漲風銳厲</h3>
<p>昨日人造絲紡建公司未掛牌，改於今日開貨，故黑市價又一致猛升，一二〇號天橋有光，上午喊二百四十五萬元，下午更抬高至六十萬元，最大喊到六十五萬元，較上日高漲念餘萬元，不過抬價過昂，做開殊少，下午雜牌一二〇號有光五十六萬元半，光二百〇五萬元均有交易，前者比上日大廿萬元左右，後者大十五萬元之譜，廠經平穩，因銀根奇緊，欲漲無力，綢貨當令者，售價略有增加，如民生之新艷錦及秋絲縐，昨成交價均加起一二千元，華錦縐大一百元，餘皆堅穩</p>
<h3>粳秈回漲油價猛跌</h3>
<p>米市到消兩接，新粳仍稀，白元仍缺，陳粳寥寥，店方納胃尙殷，秈米回漲千餘元，白元盤堅，新粳形勢緊俏，陳粳冷落，陳尖亦漸凋零，均以新貨爲大宗矣，麵粉零消帶呆，下挫百元，小麥閩甬動而不旺，交易稀寥，略小三五百元，北方白麥亦少進胃。</p>
<p>黃豆供過於求，中下等新豆續小五六百元，陳豆貨稀平平，蠶豆各路來源湧旺，而以浙省揀靑來貨獨多，猛小一二千元，尙乏交易，生仁廣幫不動，本街看望，猛小三四千元，尙覺呆木，麩皮步削一二百元，油市來貨略多，貨高能招遠客，店方存看小之志，無意進取，市價猛削二三千元，尙難立足。</p>
<h3>糖價再降</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢仍軟，而實銷亦觀望少動，中砂白續降三四千元，漸與評價有接近之望，下午台公司照評價十四萬元開與各糖行台中砂一批，確數若干尙未宜布，號貨僅零星成交，計汕帮冲提靑十二萬八千元，五十包。興化白十六萬五千元，興化赤十三萬六七千元，均小數千元。</p>
<h3>秋繭約五千担　貸款尙在商議中</h3>
<p>秋繭成熟時期，兩週後即届，各廠商對春季生絲墊款，尙無着落故當前急務，不止秋繭貸款問題一端，若生絲收購以七十八分均勻Ｄ級照二三條紋，每担以三百八十萬元計算，約値四百億元據絲業人士稱，每担乾　收價爲二百廿萬元，繅工費一百萬元，利息約六十萬元，再加保險管理等費，爲數不貲，若早日收購，可減少消耗及虧折，至秋　貸款問題，各方正積極推動，有關各方面代表，正在討論規定收購繭行數目，貸放，分配減低消費，及開價等事，又悉：秋繭的計可收五千祖，預計貸款爲一百五十　元，繅工費約五十億元，責成廠商收購，而由中蠶公司輔導。</p>
<h3>節關近銀根緊　證劵黑市寥落</h3>
<p>華股市况沉寂，各股一致下降，小股及冷門更甚晨初尙現平穩，高價時永紗六四八元，美亞三八五〇元，景福二五五元，新光二七五元，勤與一九五元，不分即逐漸轉疲，終於在缺乏維持及銀根逼迫下，不支而降，惟美亞尙形平和，結果較前收計永紗美亞　降，景福新光勤興各跌半成左右、較冷各中小型股亦帶小半成左右，元老股微現回小。</p>
<p>外股證券帮中人，鑒於報載外股不上市之訊，續有了結，於是熱門大股續趨下游，小股較爲平和，老多頭及西商逢低加碼，得以支持，爲狀平庸，結果校前收計怡紗英聯跌半成，業廣平平，餘者雖跌而不多。</p>
<h3>日本貨下週可到　中信將分批出售</h3>
<p>我向日訂購之人造絲，數量極鉅，據中信局易貨處經理何墨林談，首批訂貨，下週內即可運到，爲避免市塲劇烈波動起見，決分批售出，並直接配售絲織廠，不在市塲買賣，本市各廠用戶，委托中紡公司配售，外埠由木局直接發售，預料目前漲風猛烈之人造絲，將隨勢而趨平抑。</p>
<h3>銀錢業奉令　延長營業時間</h3>
<p>午後一時起四時止</p>
<p>本市各銀行錢莊，營業時間，向爲午前九時起至十二時止，午後一時起至三時止，近奉財政部令，午後改爲一時起四時止，各行莊奉令後，已於四日起遵令延長一小時。</p>
<h3>天津中央分行　擬直接辦外滙</h3>
<p>〔天津四日電〕中央銀行津分行經理卞喜孫氏稱，外匯初開放時，因對外貿易未復正常，故僅限上海總行結匯，今後各地對外貿易漸繁。尤其天津更為重要爲便利進出口商人起見，已請准總行設立津行外匯科，近並請求總行准許該行直接對外結匯，如能獲准，則貿易商人及指定銀行自行獲到極大便利。</p>
<h3>營業稅　仍照現稅率徵收　按業分級俟修正時再議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市商會以前據各業公會建議營業稅按業分級征收一案，曾於七月十三日，臚陳理由，電請財政部核辦。茲商會奉八月廿九日財部批示稱：元代電悉。查本部爲體恤商艱，已將現行營業稅稅率，减半征收。據請按業分類酌定稅級各節，尙有可採，應留俟將來修正營業稅法時參考。在未修正前，仍應體念時艱，依照現行稅率，勉力繳納，以重國課爲要。商會常錄批於日前分函各業公會查照。</p>
<h3>糧食轉口限制　奉令延長兩月</h3>
<p>行政院頃訓令江海關稅務司白立查，對於前所規定米穀由滬報運轉口之限制辦法，延長兩個月，至十月底爲止，以繼續定滬市糧食。</p>
<h3>船期迫近　外銷茶活躍</h3>
<p>洋莊茶市，以船期迫近，出口行之買聲甚囂塵上，行市繼續進展，陳抽珍由新華茶葉公司向中南茶廠搜得八十六箱，每担竟創七萬四千元高峯，比前軋升四千元光景，他若陳針眉，陳珍眉，祁門紅茶，福建小種，協和，同孚兩洋行及午昌·注裕泰·華茶等公司，各有相當沾染，至於印莊欲辦之Ｂ·Ｏ·Ｐ·嘜台灣細紅茶，據產區消息，邇來每担已漲至台幣四千元，另加運費等，合本市每担至少須售法幣十三萬元强，照此情形而論，恐一时難以順利脫手。</p>

<h3>蔣主席的家鄉</h3>
<p>— 本報廿二日奉化訊　特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>自然環境可以影響個人的氣度和學養，一種人物的成長，無疑他與所生長的地方有着莫大的關係。例如我們在紹興時，感到一種渾厚純樸與堅忍的環境，所以才有越王勾踐的故事。又如我們在餘姚時，感着河山秀麗，景物宜人，所以才有嚴子陵·王陽明·朱舜水　黃黎洲等的先賢。我們在寗波，這確是一個交通的口岸、所以商　　盛，人民多以經商爲生。毗鄰寗波的奉化，是我們國民政府　蔣主席的家鄉，我們對於這位偉大人物的崇敬、當然會使我們連想到他故里的自然環境。</p>
<p>到寗波後的第三天，我們就上奉化去。路上石子狠多，也並不頂平坦，過江口橋，這是交通部在這條公路上唯一的新建築，就到奉化城。</p>
<p>奉化面積有五千多平方里，可耕土地爲三十餘萬畝，人口有二十三萬人。這裏有縣立奉化中學，泰淸中學兩所，小學有錦溪小學等。奉化中學創於遜淸光緒年間，原名鳳麓中學，爲　蔣主席少年時代就讀之處。我們到奉化中學，見窗戶等均遭破壞，甚爲殘敗，地方人士，正謀復興中。錦溪小學原爲錦溪書院，後改爲小學，蔣主席也從這學校裏畢業的。</p>
<p>奉化縣城不太大，離城三里許有大橋，通寗海，寗波等處，所以商業較本化城內為繁盛。</p>
<p>縣城憑山而建　鳳山確似鳳凰</p>
<p>奉化縣憑鳳山而建，鳳山確像鳳凰，當地人相傳「奉化」本稱「鳳花」，山肖鳳，縣城本肖花。宋時人才輩出，學風亦盛。至元時有縣知事某，妬嫉奉化的文物，遂令縣民暫遷，將縣城改建，築成大刀形。在縣城所經的鳳首處，特釘木樁與長鐵釘十數枚，從此奉化無一名人。淸時縣人祗要做縣知事的，已爲舉縣所崇敬了。至淸末時，革命前輩周日宣先生，乃將木樁釘子盡行拔去。因此，奉化又步入了人才輩出的時代。這不過是流傳在奉化民間的故事，但鳳山似凰，確係事實。現在周日宣老先生已物故，葬在文廟之畔。周先生爲　蔣主席所敬佩之一人，故墳墓爲　蔣主席出資所造。</p>
<p>奉化城的建築毀壞的也很多，縣境有四明山，所以亦不甚安寗。現在唯一的任務，就是在如何安定秩序和復興建設。</p>
<p>由奉化城到縣屬溪口，道路亦未見十分平坦。其中有幾條木橋，有傾圯坍壞之虞。我們躭心如果蔣主席還鄕，會使他　　，的辛勞之餘更感着一段旅途的煩苦。</p>
<p>提起了文昌閣　尙有餘悸餘驚</p>
<p>溪口姑到了。前進數十步，即至武嶺門。門內宏偉的建築，爲武陵醫院和武嶺學校，院校之前有一丘墩，上有文昌閣，閣旁原有現代化住房建築一座、為　蔣主席下榻所，已爲敵人炸毁無存。傳說當時敵人獲得情報，蔣主席還鄉，且住於此屋中，乃發動重轟炸機猛炸，所以溪口的老百姓，提起文昌閣被炸這件事，還是有餘驚和餘憤的。登文昌閣，可望溪流由遠處蜿蜒來到它的脚邊。</p>
<p>武嶺學校毀損　如今都已修葺</p>
<p>武嶺學校，有初中和小學，今年增設高中，學生有七百多人。溪口人讀書，是不必化錢的，一切都免費。校中有醫院，嚴塲，林塲，罐頭廠。由　蔣主席親兼　　？設校務長。由施季言先生担任，教職員共有三十餘人。聽施先生說：「收復時，武做學校被糟蹋得不忍卒覩，現在的一切都是新近修葺起來的。」我問每月經費有多少，他說：「也不算多，因爲　蔣主席本人亦窮呀！」校舍的建築，是中西混合式，屋頂爲中式，屋身爲西式。內面很多佈置，又是古色古香。施先生又說：「此校創辨時，即着手農塲的經營，現在農塲產品，差不多可以自給自足了。溪口本來蔬菜很貴，如現在市上購買二百餘元一斤的蔬菜，現在我們需七十元一斤就够了。」</p>
<p>溪口的溪流，全名剡溪，發自嵊縣。嵊縣又源出東陽，天台，武義三縣。剡溪流經溪口，另名錦溪，溪身多已露底，石卵累累，僅有小舟曲折盤旋而過。猶憶前人詩：「戴灣衝瀨片帆通，高枕微吟到剡中。」却完全不同。沈成章氏指着面前的溪流吿訴我：「民廿五年來此時，此溪竹筏接踵，現已漸乾涸了，所以溪口必須要注意水利。」又說：「廿五年乃與徐源泉先生來此，宿在武嶺學校，吃在　蔣主席家裏、白天遍訪名勝。」</p>
<p>老屋樸實無華　僱工敲釘裝修</p>
<p>由武嶺學校而上一條水門汀築成的小小馬路，平坦異常，一排水泥的圓柱　杆，憑江而築，約可一百碼，便是正街。街道兩旁，並不高大的房屋，開設着一些小小的店舖，有電信局與郵局。過蔣家祠，門前有額曰：「忠孝傳家」，爲　蔣主席手筆。再前進而至老屋，並不豪華，極爲樸實。過白粉牆的圓洞門，門上書有「素居」兩字。入內便是幾進中式的房舍，中有堂屋，供有神位，蔣母王太夫人的遺像供在中間，兩旁有幾把嵌有大理石的椅几，折入裏面，有六間近代的房屋，也極其普通，所有全部屋舍、都爲敵破壞甚多。現在始雇二三工人，在敲釘裝置。</p>
<p>松林鳥雀噪鳴　歌頌蔣母功績</p>
<p>行二公里而至魚鱗岙脚下，拾級而登，蒼翠滿地，松林繁密。在樹叢中傳出一兩聲鳥雀的鳴聲，這是歌頌　蔣母的功績。爬三里而至蔣母墓盧。進門上有一匾，書「慈庵」兩字，爲譚延　氏手筆。後有碑亭一所，中豎一石碑，銘　國父祭蔣母文。碑後銘刻　蔣主席述母事略，爲于右任手筆，兩壁有石碑六，均爲國民政府中國國民黨褒獎　蔣主席之文。接迎碑亭的兩邊，右邊爲　蔣主席的臥室，放沙發椅與圓茶儿，床置於進門的右中側，床頭置一几，右側有梳粧台一，長腰圓的鏡子，在鏡子下面放着一匹磁製的白馬，姿態如生，在梳粧台對面，有衣櫃一具，上置白磁鵝一隻。左端有壁爐，據同去的蔣國權先生說：「這隻壁爐是燒柴木的。」壁爐左，折入有盥洗與衛生間二。</p>
<p>碑亭左面屋，爲會客室，內置沙發與桌椅。</p>
<p>石碑遭敵破壞　妙高台更慘烈</p>
<p>再左速接有平房四五間，想爲厨房等用。各室窗帘，均係布製。據同去的蔣立祥先生說：「收復時，石碑被敵人弄壞了，主席的臥室被敵人作爲馬廐，房屋被羿壞得不堪居住。現在都是新近修葺的，主席還沒有看過呢！」我問　主席來溪口時到底寓在什麼地方的時間多？據他說：「妙高台也有幾間小屋，主席遊山時，住在那裏，文昌閣有時雖然也住，但時間並不多。最多住的地方當然是此地。」我又問妙高台的房舍破壞程度如何？他說：「破壞更甚了，現在也是新修的，一切設備，主席也沒有看過，不知道他滿意不滿意？」</p>
<p>循山徑而上，抵蔣母墓前。國父手筆「蔣母之墓」四字銘於石碑之上。我們祭奠一番，復徘徊良久、見面前一座山崗，猶似屛風一般。崗下良田百千畝，遠望四面的山上，都是在雄峻巾帶着清秀之氣，瑰麗中帶着壯偉之槪。去妙高台與雪寳寺，還有二十五里路。妙高台在四明山上，松林挺翠，野花飄香，主席行館建在那裏，也是極爲簡單而樸素的八間二層樓屋。對面三里為雪　寺，同行俞濟民氏告訴我：「昔年寺內僧人每多慢客，民廿五年時故前主席林森先生，簡從來此，亦遭慢待，遂由曾養甫先生等在寺五十公尺處營建房舍，設中國旅行社，優待遊客，廿六年夏，張學良氏來寓於此，走電失火，焚燬殆盡，今屋基尙存。」</p>
<p>寺附近，有千丈岩，俯望深不可測，瀑如白練，奔騰而下。張學良氏來此時，曾以爆竹燃後，擲入岩下，其聲震動，如山崩裂。前進盤旋下至上隱潭，四面削壁，僅一路可通，而細雨微飄，臨風飛舞，身心凉爽。又下至中隱潭下隱潭，都是不可多得的勝地。</p>
<p>溪口景色雄偉　損失亦自可觀</p>
<p>溪口的風景，可說雄偉瑰麗，不過戰時的損失也極可觀，先後被敵機在炸十三次，淪陷後又遭敵僞股匪損害，統計人口被槍殺者有二百十七人，擄去失蹤者有七十三人，洋房全被焚毁者共一百廿八間，樓房六百三十間，平房七百零二間，半毁者洋房九十五間，樓房一千三百六十間，平房四百七十間，損失米一萬五千石，穀廿三萬斤，牛三百七十七頭。猪六百四十八隻，大樹四千八百餘株，竹一百五十萬株，茶葉二千餘箱。自衛槍械九十八枝。併起來，這筆數字也是極可觀的。</p>
<p>鎭上有警察所一，警察警長共祗十二人，每名警察的薪津僅八千多元，並未例外優厚，即　蔣主席的館舍，與我們在天目山麓寓一夜的潘莊相較，潘莊的設備不知要好到多少倍。俞濟民吿訴我：「昔年劉茂恩軍長去溪口謁</p>
<p>蔣主席，回來對人說，我想一位繫國家安危的人，他的家鄕，正不知怎樣的豪華了，但是看到</p>
<p>蔣先生這樣的樸實，眞叫我們慚愧！」</p>

<h3>答復讀者　法律質疑</h3>
<p>（一）家庭糾紛</p>
<p>陳辛問　某甲在十三歲時由父母之命媒妁之言與乙女訂婚，於民國廿四年制服時草草成親，未舉行重大儀式，（俗稱竈頭拜親）。現已生有子女四人。於卅年夏乙女忽患神經病，閱二月治愈，今某甲擬與乙女離婚，有疑問三點。</p>
<p>（一）鄕間竈頭拜親所結合之夫婦，是否合法？（二）曾患神經病現已治愈，可否作為離婚之理由？（三）本年（卅五年）春，甲乙會由律師作證書立分居契約，各執一紙爲憑，如何再進行澈底離婚，是否需訴之於法庭方可解決？</p>
<p>〔傅况鱗律師答〕（一）鄕間灶頭上拜婚，可視作習慣法，並不構成不合法之結婚條件，祗須當時有公開之儀式，及二人以上之證人，即爲合法，（二）須有重大不治之精神病者，始可構成離婚條件，（三）女方如亦願離婚，即由雙方書立協議離婚字據，各執一紙爲憑，否則須向法院提起離婚之訴，但須女方有構成離婚之條件者方可·</p>
<p>（二）退約還債</p>
<p>王茵芝問　敝友李女士，於數年前與某君訂婚，現因意見不合，要求解除婚約，而對方知事不可勉強，亦表同意。惟要求將過去自願給與之接濟，悉數以五千倍計算歸還，未知此項要求是否合法？</p>
<p>〔傅况鱗律師答〕查償還舊債，應增加若干倍計算，應由雙方各以公平方法洽商行之，此乃事實問題，法律並無增加倍數之明文，如雙方各執不能協意時，惟有訴之法庭解決之。</p>
<p>（三）王大可問　余於十五歲時，由父母作主憑媒與一女子訂婚，對於該項婚的余絕不同意，現余另有女友，互期白首，但因格於前約，不能訂婚，余屢促家長解除前約，父母雖已應允，然遲不實行，茲有疑問數則，請予答復</p>
<p>（一）該項婚約未得本人同意，是否有效，父母有强制履行之權否？（二）如現與女友訂婚是否有罪，前約對余有約束之效能否？是否須解除後方可，該項婚約須由何人解除？（三）訂婚結婚家長不主持有效否？（四）男子和女子的成人年齡，以幾歲爲標準？</p>
<p>〔傅況麟律師答〕（一）婚約應由男女當事人自行訂定，他人不得加以强迫；（二）前訂之婚約，本人旣不同意，可由本人或父母出面，向對方洽商解除，此項婚約，如對方無過失，並應向其給付相當之損害賠償金。此項損害，不限於財產上之損害，俟婚約解除後，再與他人另訂婚的·（三）無須家長主持，但須有公開之儀式，及二人以上之證人·　滿二十歲爲成年。</p>

<h3>准上行</h3>
<p>— 本報廿四日淮南航訊　特派員邵慎之</p>
<p>荒唐的田家庵</p>
<p>以整個皖省來說，田家庵才是皖省的中心。每天五點牛鐘，從九龍崗車房調單機到這裏，把一列今晨八時開的列東向蚌埠駛行。今天我坐車機到達這裏，然後換乘淮南路的聯運輪船到正陽關去。</p>
<p>天色逐漸放出曙光，這殘破的田家庵就逐漸淸晰地暴露出來。那水潭碼頭已八年不用，現在完全爲淮水所淹，破舊的太欄如同一具巨獸的骸骨，撑出在水面上，好像在訴說昔日的光榮。</p>
<p>主持建設委員會的張騫老先生，淮路興工時還興匆匆的來舉行破土典禮，他的成就一件一件在歷史的洪水中吞沒，這條路便是足可紀念他的遺跡，田家庵淸靜殘破，規模宛在。這才是最最傷心慘目的景象。</p>
<p>當時出裕路的營業收入，以公里數平均，在全國中佔第二位，第一位是正太路。每月收入六十萬，付銀行的借款利息十萬元，開支十八萬，可以凈餘卅二萬，淮南煤礦還不在內，這是國家的好收入。建設委員會結束，建設銀公司的資本就攙了進來，逐漸變成私人企業。目前如果沒有這巨大的私人資木投下去，那麼連大通淮南兩礦的順利開工，是頗成問題的。</p>
<p>淮南公司下的礦路兩局，路局不必說，局長吳競淸，副局長吳衛中。寗樹藩三位是幹材，後兩位都是淮南舊人，寗則曾於抗戰中主持招商局業務，經營起來不惟駕輕，而且就熟。但現在是借路開車，田裕復軌在望似不在望，當前是苦悶期。至於礦局長王德滋（前節中誤書為寗），即是戰前大通礦長，並由謝季綱。李境任副礦長，大通礦所以投入淮南公司，固有合併上的方便，事實上也有其資本上的苦悶。今日中國。眞正的私人資本實在不易有所施展。</p>
<p>我看到了田家庵的慘狀，頗生感慨。田家庵有多少人口，據說連鎭長自己也不知道。它北臨淮河，屬懷遠縣，接鳳台·壽縣交界，從這裏南至水家湖，這一個狹長地帶，東接黃姑蕩，西接瓦埠湖，北臨淮水，恰恰三面是水。皖省著匪，都在這裏嘯聚過。據說孫美瑤。張大辮子之流，都有過黃金時代。以此起家而「改邪歸正」的亦頗有人在。淮南路一通，正搗破了這老巢。然而「風氣」這名詞，說似抽象，實亦具體，在三縣犯案的英雄們仍有以此爲遷隱所在之勢。這一帶幾乎家家戶有槍支，民衆樂於求槍而不疲。日軍駐在這一帶礦區時，從泰縣拆了房子來蓋營房，投降之後，槍支出賣不少，自來得手槍每枝一千元，三八步槍一千不到。眞是得其所哉。「民間武力」蓬蓬勃勃，不似日本鬼子在時不好隨便玩了。</p>
<p>二十天以前，這裏駐軍營部的隔壁就發生搶案，有的說這因爲是編餘軍人多的緣故，有的說這</p>
<p>搶修完竣之新堤，右旁爲准河，帆檣林立，船與堤齊水位高出堤左數公尺。</p>
<p>是客匪，弄幾文盤纏。總之是人心惶惶，說編餘軍人，也確實可觀，從河南或皖北來，就從這裹轉到津浦，南京或皖南去，軍官有軍官隊進，大都則去自謀差使，—當然仍是軍差爲主，一路拖兒帶小，川資缺乏，脾氣　極，然而無人不原諒和同情他們，但這不過是一句空話，無補於實際</p>
<p>說到匪，則由此循淮河東下十餘里，在老船塢馬頭城等處，兩岸據說有一二千人，有機關槍，商船時常出事，少數不敢開，非有二三百條結在一起，請軍隊護送，浩浩蕩蕩鼓噪而過不可，身臨其境，當然緊張透了，也實在好看煞人。可惜我不敢嘗試、沒法把經騐吿訴諸位。</p>
<p>位新來駐防的營長爲了鎭長連居民人數也不淸楚而發了一頓脾氣，現在總算在查戶口了。一堆黃土茅屋、簡直無法描寫其特點，這就是皖北一帶習見的小市鎭。規規矩矩的生意人是不易立足的，自有地痞流氓攪得你垮了定結。然而最爲他們任意騁馳的地方—賭局却十分興盛，賭得發昏，往往眞刀眞槍。</p>
<p>有「靠不住」的小旅館，其規模尙不及廣西余城江或河南界首的寳貝旅館，凡是從蚌埠到正陽關的旅客一到，立刻鑚上聯運的淮南路局輪船，雖然露宿，亦所不顧、固然，一方面也是爲了有幾個錢、觀乎衰落荒唐的田家庵、眞不相信這就是中國。「你上去就知這了，這一帶都是這樣的。」一個礦警嚴肅地對我說·因此我想到張　這樣的人，而對於目前在碉堡叢中的路礦局諸位，也表示十分佩服。還要祝福許多旅人（我自己也在內）以及衆家英雄們。（特派員邵償之攝）</p>
<p>上溯淮河</p>
<p>田家庵與正陽關間，上水要九小時，下水則爲五小時行程·商辦省辦的輸運，購票後無定期，一定要買票買到有錢可賺時才開動。淮南路弄了兩隻輪船每天在這一段對開，和火車聯運，於是這些省辦和商辦的生意被搶光·他們遂另闢途徑，一齊趕到頴水去，開阜腸和界首—抗戰期中走私的著名巢穴之一。</p>
<p>現在目田家庵西開，一條普通內河小火輪，拖一條大木駁，戰前太通礦老六號煤船。淮河老水手還能叫出每隻船的名稱和經歷。他們一致惋惜許多好船在撤退時拉得正陽關劈柴燒，對這高齡的老船則表毫無興緻·「這像人一樣，」一個老水手說：「淮河上年靑力壯的死的死，跑的跑，都不見，只有我們這些老不中用的還挨着。」</p>
<p>他似乎頗以「還挨着」爲慚愧。「還挨着」就是屈服於命運的別稱，然而他不以爲是，這就可見其性格和風習·</p>
<p>他這句話所涉的範圍太廣泛了，自抗戰以迄現在，這不短的八年全包括在裘面·兵　，災害，瘟疫，以及自己的更加衰老和貧苦。我坐在木駁後梢的艙房裏看班護路警荷槍實彈，船頭架上機關槍，一有小划子靠近，立刻會鳴槍示威，令其遠離。至於淮水的洶湧，災區的廣泛，更因坐船而清楚獲得瞭解。愈向上駛，黃水愈見勇猛，如果不是有樹梢屋頂藏起，那麼我們所經過的幾乎就是一個黃海了，駕駛船隻的老大所以能够辨別河道所在，也就靠這些樹稍的指示。這樣區大的災情，並不引起舉國嚴重注意，而災區民衆始終在沈默中，這眞是冷酷的中國！沒有一個負責的官吏到這裏來看一看，却開口閉口爲民前鋒，推卸責任。一說起救災就是錢，這都不是中國人所需要的官更。</p>
<p>船上的老百姓都是冷冷的，都是被災的民衆，只說「聽天由命」，別的全認爲「算了吧」。他們自搬自挑，自蚌埠販運一點貨物來，其中有一個自阜陽來的中年婦人，她因爲尋覔丈夫和兒子的屍首，先循頴水到正陽關，再循淮水到田家庵，沒有結果，今天失望而返。廿多天以前有一條小火輸自正陽東直開界首，裝滿人貨，過了阜陽，碰到黃水的大渦流，把船捲翻，那條船冲下四十里後才被追獲，只有四個乘客從艙裏拖出，還有餘氣，終被救活，其餘則全不知去向。那個婦人說：「這全是命運注定」。他不責怪任何一個人，因此她在傷心中十分顯得心平氣和。這事遂更加增重了悲慘性。</p>
<p>到正陽關，黃水正從頴川滔滔不絕地湧出。正陽關幾乎全部陸沈，最厲害的時候只有一方里沒有水，現在水落一點，正陽關還只有兩方公里地不用濕脚走路。四面是水，只餘一個孤島。我們的輪船在田裏開過，屋脊就是最好的陸地，我將在另外一篇文章中介紹這痛苦的正陽關。</p>

<h3>台湾热带醫學研究所</h3>
<p>— 本報廿三日台北航訊　特派員江暮雲</p>
<p>合灣在日本統治時期，是作爲日本的一臠，除了在物資榨取政策之外，他們盡量用科學硏究的方法來克服自然地理所給予人爲的威脅，尤其是他需要鼓勵日本內地人向台　繁殖，他更需要以一分財力換取本雀人的三分勞力，於是作爲保健和衛生的熱帶醫學研究的發達是有其必然性的。</p>
<p>日本沒有亞熱帶，台灣眞是「得天獨厚」日本人爲了確保日本內地人在台死亡率的減低和適應於熱帶的生活，不惜化了大量的人力和物力，在醫學上用功夫，熱帶醫學硏究所就在這樣的意義下成長的。</p>
<h3>假藥橫行　有損民族健康</h3>
<p>成立了三十八年的熱帶醫學研究所，最初僅設有化學部和衛生部，後來屬於中央硏究所，七年前附屬於台灣大學、成爲配合於其他有關南洋，糖業等的主要研究所。在該所設立的熱帶病學科，熱帶衛生學科，細菌免疫學科，化學科，營養學科及漢藥學科的網要上，可以看到他們不但側重於熱帶病的硏究，調查，試騐，預防，並且還包括了營養生理及病理以及藥品的分析和鑑定，直接間接的爲熱帶地方的病者，製藥，醫治，研究和保持健康。</p>
<p>主持所務的陳禮節博士他吿訴記者說：「該所有士林台中台南三個支所，士林是細菌和免疫學的製品實騐塲所，而合中台南兩個支所則專司醫專和衛生用藥品的試騐，檢定和標封，日本人時代來台的藥品，都需要經過該所的化騐標封以後，始能出售，每年檢查約有三萬件，光復後這條法律是撤消了，現在雖仍舊繼續檢查了一萬多件，但欺詐的商人所賣的假藥·却很橫行，這不但爲台灣隱憂、直有損於民族健康！</p>
<h3>大量製作　不怕傳染病菌</h3>
<p>台灣不怕傳染病流入的，從福州帶過來的鼠疫和南方侵入的霍亂，曾猖概過一些時，因爲衛生當局的迅速措置，和該所在兩週之間製作了預防鼠疫菌苗一百四十萬人份，經常的供給霍亂預防苗，分發各縣市預防注射，結果很迅捷的將威脅生命的鼠疫消滅了。這個毁滅疫的大本營，就是士林硏究支所。</p>
<p>該所不但製作各種預防注射菌苗，包括白喉，狂犬病。流腦，霍亂鼠疫等，還有治療用的白喉血淸，百日咳，痘苗等。平時各種血淸菌苗痘苗等生物學的製品，每月每種能生產三十萬人份，必要時能增至三百萬人份。從去年十二月接收以後到七月份爲止，他們製作了八六一五三八六人份的注射苗，四三三七三CC的血淸，包括：</p>
<p>傷寒疫苗　四九、七六〇份</p>
<p>鼠疫疫苗　一二二八、八四四份</p>
<p>流行性腦脊　髓膜炎菌　七四二、五二〇份</p>
<p>霍亂疫苗　二八一六、五三〇份</p>
<p>傷寒副傷寒　混合疫苗　八〇八、四四〇份</p>
<p>痲病疫苗　一五份</p>
<p>痘苗　二九六三、八七〇份</p>
<p>白喉預防液　三四四〇份</p>
<p>百日咳疫苗　五九五份</p>
<p>赤痢疫菌　一二〇〇份</p>
<p>出血毒多價血淸　一五六份</p>
<p>神經毒多價血淸　一六份</p>
<p>霍亂診斷血淸　三〇CC</p>
<p>瓦斯坯疽血淸　三〇〇〇CC</p>
<p>破傷風血清　一三一六〇CC</p>
<p>流行性腦脊髓膜炎血清</p>
<p>一一二〇CC</p>
<p>血喉血淸　二七〇六〇CC</p>
<p>肺結核診斷原液　三CC</p>
<p>這些準確的數目，不只是告訴我們有十六種以上的病菌可以獲得預防和治療的保蹬，而且說明了他們脚踏實地的在爲人類做着消毒工作，他們沒有受到接收和光復的影響，雖然他們的研究工作曾停頓了半年，最近始由所長致力規復，但這只是屬於總所的事。</p>

<h3>乘長風破萬里浪　「梅谷將軍號」艦上記事</h3>
<p>— 黃應乾</p>
<p>「梅谷將車號」是美國主要運輸艦之一，載重二萬二千噸，在戰時有過輝煌的賞獻。比如美軍進攻琉球島之役，牠由舊金山一次載兵七千人，在馬尼剌登陸，船上尙有雷達的設備，雖然在太平洋上現時還未有掃淸的水雷，大家也覺安穩之至。這次來華是裝載美國復員官兵返國，順便搭載各國乘客五百餘人，中國乘客約二百人，戰後迄今，這條船是搭載中國乘客最多的一次。上月四日，筆者和黃德祿先生匆匆將行李搬上船去，當夜在船上歇宿。</p>
<p>播音機四項通告</p>
<p>五日晨，船上播音機先後播發幾起通吿：（一）九時起檢查防疫證件。（二）請客人不上岸，絕對不許上岸。（三）午后四時啓碇。（四）夜十二時後不許賭博。滿懷離緒的乘客們遂開始感覺緊張了，到九時大家手特防疫證件，由上海海關所派警官來船主持檢騐，以往外國人因受不平等條約的保護，照例不受檢查，自不平等條約廢除後，所有在船上外國官兵，各國人士，連中國乘客，通通均必憑證檢騐，大家排成行列，依照規定辦理。這很明顯的表示：中國的國際地位確屬提高了。忽然發現一位乘客患天花，登時拉出請其離船。如到美國港埠，凡遇有天花霍亂等傳染病的病人在船上，不但病人不許上岸，某他客人的行李乃至輪船的船身，均必加以消毒的淸洗，始准靠岸。故防疫實在是船上主要工作之一。午后四時，輪船啓碇，緩緩向吳淞口外駛行·我和德驗相顧而言曰：「萬里之行，始於足下」，乘長風，破萬里浪矣。</p>
<p>太平洋上真太平</p>
<p>余家眉山，少時讀過蘇東坡先生的名詩：「吾家江水初發源，宦遊直送江入海」·余探江源於蘿口，但從未一覩水流長江歸大海的壯觀。此次佇立梅谷艦上，駛經江入海處，實覺汪洋浩瀚，巨艦檣立，遠望祟明，隱約可見。時而風帆上下，水鷗出沒，海闊天空，極饒淸趣。據聞往舊金山航綫可經三途：（一）經香港，馬尼剌赴舊金山。（二）經橫濱，檀香山到舊金山。（三）經日本海沿北太平洋旁阿留申羣島折而南向直赴舊金山。「梅谷將軍號」係採此直航，因可縮短旅程二日至三日，往常由上海經檀香山到舊金山，至少需半月航程，自採直航，十二日可抵舊金山。但在此直航大洋十二日中，全朱見一花一草，一木一石，天連水，水連天，雪浪日光，海鷗畏鯨與蔚藍的水色，爲海上僅有的奇景。在遼廓的虛空中，頻添上無限溫情的慰藉。航程圖表係依地球經緯度爲準則，方向至爲正確，船過日本海，沿北太平洋，愈行愈凉。十二日過地球子午綫時，風雨交加，大霧茫茫，寒流襲人，衣必棉毛，全船乘客，頗感顚沛之苦。過此西南，進入西半球，又愈行愈熱了。船行速度每小時約爲十八浬，聽說美國正在趕造新輪，每小時速度增爲卅浬，由上海到舊金山。六日可達。這實予未來乘客以快速便利的信號。別滬時，朋友們向我舉杯預祝，一路順風，船行的安穩，實在使我感謝朋友們的祝福與祈禱，太平洋上眞大平！</p>
<p>平常航行遠洋的商船設備，頗爲富麗堂皇，內有圖書室，游泳池，電影塲，跳舞廳，彈子房等，每日自晨至晚，均可使客人各有其快意的娛樂。現時中美的客運商運，均未正式恢復，「梅谷號」是一艘運輸艦，艙位：美國軍官爲一等，各國人士爲一等，美國兵又爲一等。船上尙有半軍事性質的管理，故各項設備當然付之缺如了。一般客人生活上表現出來，不外悶，暈，困，三種現象。在食的方面，名爲自助餐，每日三餐，聞描鈴聲，所有客人均分批列隊，魚貫進入餐廳，手持餐盤，聽候分配食料。，必將餐盤退回指定地點，每日輪流配食牛，羊，猪肉及少許蔬菜水菓等，所有肉食一色味甜，又加油膩，最初三日尙覺可口。第五日後，即有食之不能下咽之苦·捧餐盤而愁悶，飲咖啡而厭煩。大家互相問詢：你到舊金山第一件作什麼事？必答：吃中國菜是第一件事。尙有百餘猶太客人，每天要吃好多次，他們不在餐廳中吃飯，食時口中唸唸有詞，仍然保守其特有風氣。此一無國家的民族，在我國開封東門外的一個村莊裏尙住有千餘家，大體是被中國同化了。中國乘客們好多都是初過航海生活，上船就感暈船，暈船便困在舖上。飯後又多上舖，拿本小說，困而學之。夜生活則中外人士羣集餐廳，下象棋，推牌九，打麻雀，玩梭哈，一直到夜十二時，始蘭珊而散。中國的朋友們夜七時到九時，還組有演講會，並有小姐獨唱及平劇等等。大家還印有同舟錄，表現出一團熱力與和氣。四川朋友們的道地作風，是擺龍門陣，如是朝朝暮暮，十二日的短短航程，覺得飛也似的過去了。船到舊金山，大家對「梅谷號」實不勝其惜別與依依之忱。</p>
<p>赴美以前的準備</p>
<p>出國不是一件很容易的事，有其相當麻煩。以後中美客運恢復，出國人士增多。關於赴美前之準備，特將此次經騐所得，一一寫出，藉供讀者參考：（一）護照：普通護照由各機關申請，各院部核准，轉咨外交部發給，官員護照必須國府核准，始能承領，外交護照爲政府外交人員及政府特派人員，持此護照，經過任何港埠海關，均享有免予檢騐的優待·將出國護照領得後。須由美國駐滬總領事館簽證。並由江海關防疫處或指定醫院。究成打針手續，並取得防疫處黃色證書，始可到輪船公司購票。到美國所帶外匯，愈多愈好，如所帶外匯過少，或在千元以內，則必有確切的担保，始能上岸。這是在美領館必須詢及的一件事。（二）英美兩國習慣，各有不同，英國有紳士風度，在餐廳，客廳，均必整其衣冠，尊其贍視，美國人則富粗豪氣槪，任性自然，其衣着於整潔中亦覺彬然有禮，故出國時應携帶睡衣，睡褲，牙刷，口盂，拖鞋，其他船上均應有盡有。衣服則隨時序而酌定，以少帶爲佳。（三）食物方面，千萬要帶四川榨菜，雲南大頭菜，及你所願意購買的中國罐頭食品，中國茶葉更應帶上，如船上食物吃厭了，則吃點大頭菜或飲一鍾中國茶，大大的可提神養氣，這幾項準備工畢作，都得予以注意。淮南居民自築小堤以原始方式排水（特派員邵愼之攝）</p>

<h3>小腦筋負担太重了</h3>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>值此百廢待舉之際，教育實爲立國樹人之基，而小學教育尤應特別注重，關於小學教育，雖教育部歷有規定，且時請專家集會究討，然滬市之小學教育，尙有若干處不能合於標準，是以有不能已於言者。</p>
<p>其一，滬市或以環境關係，在初小三年級時即有添授英文課程，實際此種兒童，實足年齡不過七入歲，腦力簡單脆弱，授以外國文字，不能意味體會，只知師云亦云，隨聲唱和，字母之拚成，文法上之多數少數，更不瞭解。而兒童懼受師責，加以家長之督促，課後苦苦呆讀，不知費幾何時，脆弱之腦筋，負担實覺太重。如此徒費時光，不能收效之教學，何不明令改正，展緩至五年級開始，與市立學校相同？</p>
<p>其二，教師每日令小學生回家後鉛筆抄書或抄生字，每日最多有達七八百字，最少亦必三四百字。兒童放學歸家，除準備大小楷，日記，或算術習題外，尙須伏案作書，不能作戶外之活動，有時入暮尙未完畢，晚膳後仍須繼續工作，影響其體力，視力，且養成草率從事之習慣，殊非淺鮮！如此欲求造成體智健全之國民，恐不易得？教師之意，固欲學生多加訓練，但亦曾慮及受此影響造成若干不良之後果否？</p>
<p>上述兩端，均爲鄙人就家庭中四五在學兒童與親友中在學兒童觀察所及，幷細加硏討，認爲有改進之必要，因此略陳管見，請貴刋予以發表，以供小學教育當局之參考。</p>

<h3>談個性</h3>
<p>— 夏鎮夷</p>
<p>心理衛生的秘訣</p>
<p>在你的親戚朋友或你的同胞兄弟姊妹中，你常可發現兩種完全不同的個性：有一種人常沉默寡言，多疑善感，不善交際，也不喜歡運動或娛樂，他對於團體生活好像是絕緣了的，他一天到晚像在深思遠慮，沉溺於幻想之中，以求得他唯一的滿足，有時在白天裏會拋棄工作，去沉思夢想，建造許多空中樓閣，他在公共的塲合，常獨處一旁，不願參加談笑、在人多的地方就覺怕羞而臉紅，他避免向大衆講話的機會、即使在講台之前將講詞背得滾瓜爛熱，一上了台他就現出窘態，連一句話也說不上來。</p>
<p>內向與外內</p>
<p>另外一種個性的人，和上面所講的完全相反，他是多言好動、言行一致，善辭令，好交際，他能泰然的向羣衆演說，在公共塲所，很易和不相識的人厮混而常一見如故，在團體中他常是領袖，並且是，出風頭主義者，但他的情感極易波動，興奮時異常興奮，不樂時極度憂抑。這二稱個性大心理學家熊格氏（C.C.jung）定了二個名稱：前者稱爲向內者（Mtroverts）後者稱爲向外者（Exuoverts）。</p>
<p>向內的人因爲太小心眼兒，多疑善慮，故只能交很少的朋友，並且不過普通的點頭朋友，絕少心腹之交，對於異性來往更覺侷促不安，因爲他心中不能把自已忘懷，他把自己的性別，念念不忘，每當識一個生人時他喜知道道人的底細，如果他發覺這人的地位成就在他之上，便引起濃厚的自卑心理，因此他常避開這人，減少和他交往，這樣扌能保持自己「高人一等」的感覺。可是，向外的人因爲能忘懷自己而且誠懇，他能和各人相處而發生親熱的關係，因爲他心直口快，沒有謙虛做作故人都業與交往而成莫逆，若遇到比他地位高的人，他就會百般奉承，喜歡「鑚」「拍」「吹」的人就是屬於道類的個性。</p>
<p>個性與職業</p>
<p>個性的不同，與職業的選擇有密切的關係。有許多人的失敗都是由於職業與個性的不協調所致。向內的人喜歡單獨工作，他不能和他人合作；他適宜的職業爲文學家，美術家，裁衣匠，銀行會計，書記，圖書館管理員或實騐室的技佐等職業。假使一個好動的「向外」的人擔任道種職，一定沒有好的結果。向外的人呢，因他能和他人合作並且有進取心，決斷心，及領袖慾，故他最適宜當律師，醫師，政治外交家，推銷員等職務，如果這類工作給向內的人擔任，那也不易得到好結果。</p>
<p>至於個性與民族的關係，實是一個很有興趣的間題、雖然至今還沒有具體的統計可據，然據一般觀察的結果：我們東方民族比較傾向於向內的個性；西方民族比較向外，這並不是沒有原因的數千年來吾國受了儒教的影響，「重文輕武」就等於重思想輕動作，過去我國教導兒童的訓條，「書中自有黃金屋，書巾自有顏如玉」，無非使他將來成一「文質彬彬」的君子與「弱不禁風」的書生，這些都是鼓勵向內而阻遏向外發展的主因。</p>
<p>西方民族生活和中國完全相反，他們的兒童從小養成活潑冒險的習，把大部分的精神用在自己以外的事物上，所以外國孩子比中國一般的小孩要活潑。</p>
<p>誠然，向外和向內不過代表二個極端的傾向，你不能把全部人類淸楚地劃分爲向內和向外二大類，我們普通一般人的個性是在二者之間的，他在某件事上顯出他向內性，但同時在別的事上却顯出他向外性了，極端的向內和向外都不是最適宜的現象，極端向外個性定是魯莽疏忽的人；極端的向內却因太胆小懦弱，不敢應付現實的困難，而退到幻想中去，若在精神病學的眼光看來，極端向內性是精神分裂症的　型，極端向外性是躁　　的前導。</p>
<p>我們個性的形成，除了得自父母的遺傳外，更重要的就是兒童時所養成的習慣與所處的環境，中國有句俗話「江山易改，本性難易」，這句話固然很對、但也不盡然的，先天的因素我們　無法轉變，但後天的因素，我們可有彌補的方法，　　痰就要講到爲父母的責任了。假使父母遇到極端個性的孩子，就應極力設法加以適當的教導，使能漸移默化、做到適當的改善。</p>
<p>幾條守則</p>
<p>對於極端向外性的孩子，應注意下列四點；</p>
<p>（一）給孩子充分的工作，因他有充分的精力，引導其向有益的方面發洩。</p>
<p>（二）鍛練結實的身體，給予各種戶外工作。</p>
<p>（三）使其養成獨立性與責任心，使其養成開始一件工作，必須有一結束的習慣。</p>
<p>（四）助其自制情感。</p>
<p>對於極端向內性的孩子則應注意：</p>
<p>（一）充分鍛練身體，多與他人來往，免除逃　反應。</p>
<p>（二）擴大他的興趣範圍。</p>
<p>（三）合理的社交化。</p>
<p>（四）如有問題，應鼓勵其充分自由，公開與家長討論。因這種孩子常因某種困難而沉思幻想，結果產生懷疑恐懼的心理，而不敢大胆她提出討論。響如，「性」「人生之謎」「死亡」等問題，爲父母的應待機先提出與討論。</p>
<p>當你分折你的個性後，發現你有向外或向內的特質，你切莫作杞人　大的無謂恐懼。要知道向內與向外的人各有他的地位，向內的人是供給思想，觀念的啓發者；而向外的人是推動　子的實行者，世界上若沒有這二種人，決不會進步到原子時代的今日。「知己知彼，百戰百勝。」我們便是在這「世界戰塲」中的一員，要應付這千變萬化的複雜的現社會，要在一切事業得到成功，只有一個秘訣：就是了解你的個性。</p>
<h3>精神病的潛伏期</h3>
<p>— 劉瀹慈</p>
<p>衛生是預防疾病</p>
<p>精神病同旁的病症一樣，都不是一朝一夕就能生的，它也有所謂的「潛伏時期」。不過它潛伏時期的現象不是像一般普通的病狀那樣顯而易見，所以容易被人忽略。大概是由於傳統性對於身體比對於精紳多注意的關係，所以人們發了三天寒熱，大都焦急就醫，希望即愈。可是一個人的性情忽然變得暴躁，或是多慮寡歡，人們却以爲它是家常便飯了。其實，三天的寒熱，表面似乎嚴重，一針二藥，那的確就是指日可愈的病症；心理的反常，雖然不嘔不吐，不痛不癢，外表似乎輕鬆，其實日久確會釀成棘手的重症。一則一般人都諱疾忌醫；二則人們腦海中還不大注意精神方而也會生病。所以，由慢性而不明顯的心到失常漸漸變成嚴重精神病的例案極多。換句話說，文痴武癲的瘋子都不是一言一語就能造成的，因爲他們的病症早已潛伏有期，不過它的現象未能被人早加注意，施以預防。</p>
<p>社會的複雜，環境的刺激，人們的慾望又都不約而同的那樣高。慾望得到滿足又不是那般容易，達不到慾望就難免發生心理的煩惱和衝突。在這種情形之下，所以誰也保不定誰會不會受了刺激而就生精神病症·再者精神病又不是打一針就能預防，唯一的方法，就是在日常生活之中，我們應當隨時對自己加以檢討，未雨綢繆，免得瘋病一發而即不可收拾。自己向自己檢討、自己對自己研究，對象不是別人，而是自己，再方便沒有，而且是極講求衛生的事。行總防疫隊在徐州附近鄕間爲人噴注去蝨　水</p>
<p>無名的憂鬱</p>
<p>檢舉自己簡單的方法，就是我們隨時把自己的心境加以研究，在精神方面，假如我們常常憂慮，憂慮一切不必担心的事務，或是常常猜疑，猜疑世界上一切的人都不足信任，甚至會懷疑到別人要謀害自己，平常的時候，看着別人都歡天喜地，可是自己總覺得有三四分說不出理由的不如意，如果有這種時候，我們就得捫心自問，我們的不如意有沒有顯著的原因，我們的憂慮有沒有顯著的對象，我們情緒的變化有沒有恃久性，譬如發脾氣，我們是不是發一下子就過去的，還是發起沒完，舉例來說，我們是不是看了一幕悲劇就會連哭三天，因爲一個人的心理有沒有變化，自己多少總能够覺得些，起若檢討出來，自己的行爲　和旁人兩樣，那或許就是程度上不同的心理失常了。</p>
<p>有些人眼前常常看到別人看不到的東西、有動物或有神像，也有些人常常聽到別人所聽不到的話語，歷　他的罪惡，還有些人時時有些奇特的思想，常常以爲他自己是世界的偉人，我記得曾有一個病者自己非自認是馬帥不可，其實他確是一個失業的黃包車夫，還有些人確信自己是有名的富翁，其實他的經濟狀况確是一貧如洗。</p>
<p>過分的疑慮</p>
<p>有時候我們　會作出些旣無用而又不需要的動作來，我們明知已把郵票粘上了信封，在將信拋人信箱的當兒，却非三番五次細細檢騐不可，粘了再粘，世界上眞有這種人，他把信箋放進信封裏去的時候，惟恐遺漏，拿出來放進去，曾仔細檢查了數十遍，結果收信人却還是收到了一個空信封，心理變態，五花八門，奇中生怪，不可枚述，如果我們確已有了上述的種種現象，那就是帶些神變態了。</p>
<p>還有些人被人們稱作「神經質」的人，他們好像從遺傳裏就帶些變質的個性來，他們變質的程度雖然不同，然而大都在年齡還沒有十多歲的時候，就可以看得出異常的個性，這種人智力　秀的極多，想像力也特別濃厚，但是感情和意志都有缺陷，他們的情感轉變得很快，對於愛憎的觀念也不正確，平常的時候，他們多少總帶着些抑鬱，他們缺乏忍耐力，所以容易發怒，發怒的時候，極度暴躁，而事後往往覺得後悔，他們雖然有時候也樂觀起來、以至過份的愉快，然而這時間是極短少的，他們的個性大都屬於「向內一的，（俗稱小心眼）所以對待自己極寬容而對待別人却非常嚴酷，「多疑心」是他們的特點，常常對於一件極小的事而不能安心，或是對於一件事過度的担心而轉成恐怖，他們容易失眠，常作惡夢，有時也發生悲觀厭世的想念，如果一個人眞到了這個時候，那就有精神崩潰的危險了</p>
<p>總之，精神病潛伏時期的現象極多，因爲我們對於情緒的變化大都不大注意，於是就忽略了它潛伏時期的危險。等到瘋病一旦發作，那就已經嚴重而棘手了。所以我們看見送到醫院來求治的精神病者，都已是那些非常吵鬧的病人，而事先來預防的則絕無僅有。然而精神病並不是不能預防，祗要我們能耐心隨時對自己加以檢討，防患未然，在初起時期加以初步的治療，則不致演成嚴重的病症，以至專家也束手無策，後悔無及。</p>
<h3>人與病菌之戰　（二）</h3>
<p>— 摘自「傳染病管理」　喬樹民</p>
<p>泡沬傳染——呼吸道疾病之有咳嗽或噴嚏症狀者，最易由泡沫之途徑而傳染於人，惟泡沫傳染，恒不超出十二呎以外之範圍。再則泡沬之大小，顯與所含，病菌分量有關，泡沫之大者，可含病菌較多，但落地亦較早；泡沬之小者，射程較遠，但其所含病菌常較少。近據Jenning氏之利用高速攝影法，所攝取之照片而分析，每一噴嚏，平均可以射出二萬個泡沫於空氣中，泡沬之大小不一，其中百分之八十，直徑均在二百個　以下，可以飄懸於空氣中，經迅速之蒸發而成爲泡沬核（Droplel-nuclei），飄飄盪盪，歷數小時乃至數日而不墜；其所含之病菌，亦可繼續生活若午時日，而具有傳染疾病之能力。大抵空氣閉塞之處，擁擠密集之區，此種泡沬傳染，頗不罕見。</p>
<p>（二）腸胃道傳染——由腸胃道傳染疾之疾病，在中國甚爲普遍，不潔的飲水，食品，以及蒼蠅，實爲主要之媒介，每致引發流行，其流行又可各有下列之特徵，可資鑑別。</p>
<p>1給水傳染——在歷史上，頗多給水傳染之流行病的記載，亦不乏給水控制後流行隨之撲滅的證述·、近三十餘年來，歐美各國，對於給水管理，備極注意，幷實施自來水之集中的氯氣（或漂白粉）消毒，於是腸胃傳染之流行病，在歐美頓吿絕跡，獨我中國，設有自來水之城市，在戰前僅有十七處，其中實施氯氣或漂白粉消毒者，不過七處，鄕村更無論矣。以此腸胃傳染病，到處盛行，常年皆有。即霍亂一項，已流行過五十三次之多，死於斯者，不知凡幾——</p>
<p>此外，如生冷食品，冰製品，游泳池等，亦皆可有同樣之傳染機會。</p>
<p>2乳類傳染——乳爲培養一般病菌之絕妙媒介，故在歐美習於飲乳之國家內，乳類傳染，不僅限於一般腸胃傳染，即於腥紅熱，白喉，結核等，大小流行，無慮千百起。中國飲乳之習慣絕少，尙未如彼嚴重</p>
<p>3蒼蠅傳染——夏秋之李、蒼蠅　生。如糞便汚物，不有滴當之處理，則蒼蠅携帶病菌於食物，而致傳染疾病者，極其普遍。查傳染疾病之蒼蠅，百分之九十九爲家蒼（M.Domestica），此種蒼蠅，多喜集於糞便，汚物，及食物之上，允以含有糖質之食物爲然。蓋蒼蠅不能消化蛋白質或澱粉，而必須嘔吐胃汁，以溶解食物中之糖質，然後吸食之，其嘔出物即可含有可病菌。考蒼蠅所含有之病菌，其傳染力大抵不超過四十八小時，最多亦不超過五日。有時蒼蠅可飛達一千七百磚之距　，惟其所帶病菌，則視其環境如何而定。</p>
<p>（三）昆蟲及傷口傳染</p>
<p>1傷口傳染——傷口侵入之病菌，或爲　氣　，或爲　氣屬，前者爲球菌，如葡萄球菌之類，允以鍵球菌有自淋巴管侵入血流之强烈趨勢爲重要；後者以破傷風桿菌爲最重要。</p>
<p>2昆蟲傳染——蟲傳染之病菌，或自其喙嘴刺入，或由於人的手指抓搔擦入，亦間有自傷口侵入者。大抵細菌之屬，多導源於脊椎動物；原蟲之屬，多導源於昆蟲本身。原蟲頗多異於細菌之處，允以前者多有「有性的生殖史」爲特殊。寄生以有性生殖階段者，是爲終結宿主，寄生以無性生殖階段者是爲中間宿生。完成其有性生殖之階段，乃能達無性之生殖階段，然後始能傳染於中間宿主。此完成有性生殖階段之時間，謂之外潛伏期，對於傳染病的管理，不無重要關係。凡具有外潛伏期之傳染病，其致病的微生物，多爲原蟲，但亦有爲濾過性毒者。</p>
<p>外潛伏期之重要性句得而言者有二端：一爲外潛伏期可視爲暫時的安全期，如吾人發現第一例患者，則在此期間，可趕速撲滅昆蟲，以弭傳染？其次，所謂外潛伏期者，病菌在昆蟲體內孳長生殖之時問，此種孳長生殖、必受外界氣溫之相當限制，蓋昆蟲爲冷血動物，其體溫每隨外界氣候面升降也。不僅氣溫爲然，即濕度，風向，雨量等因素、亦不無關係，詳不</p>
<p>茲假設定量的具有傳染力及毒力之病菌（種子），經由適合之途徑（播種），而侵入人體（土壤），則傳染病之發生與否，仍須視土壤之肥瘠如何——人體之感受性或抵抗力如何——而定，請論土壤。</p>

<h3>願望</h3>
<p>— 華林</p>
<p>願望好像飛鳥一樣，越過高山，越過狂海，向無限地前途遠　，時光形成歷史的行程，惟有願望永遠在歷史前面，顯出美麗的光華！</p>
<p>斐地亞司，莊嚴神聖的雅典、雕塑神像，要把全希臘的美男女的典型，加入自己愛國的熱情，加入自己的全生命，雅與神聖雕塑出來，立在雅典城市中，使希臘的靑年拜倒，金光燦爛，色彩顯耀，即使偸襲的渡海敵人，也要驚慌地在神像面前低頭！</p>
<p>希臘島——希臘島！希臘詩人安在哉？愛國之詩傳最早！拜倫，哥德，都是崇拜希臘，希臘神敎，把宇宙的自然，都形成谷種美的人生，敎我們在大自然界裏陶醉，神是不離開人的，神是永遠與人很親密的，這種美麗的幻影，籠罩着海的天涯，地的盡頭，「願望」永遠是無窮盡地向前飛　！</p>
<p>這是詩意，這是　景，這是歌曲的餘　　嫋，　　三日！</p>
<p>爲什麽我們在現實世界中、消失了我們的前程，好像　　　海　一　篇州，迷　中把舵不穩，失去了方向，隨波逐流，不知伊于胡底，希　的西西島，為　馬侵入，把希臘人囚禁起來，道些囚徒，不是奴隸，大家都高唱自由歌，歌聲驚動了海濱沙鷗，驚動了山巓雄鷹，一齊隨着歌聲，都飛翔起來，感動了羅馬人的心，他們把囚徒的枷鎖，都解放了，同聲地高歌，歌聲直上雲霄，羅馬人都說，他們愛自由，我們也愛自由，大家都是一個生命！</p>
<p>眞愛自由的人，他也尊重別人的自由，若果然解放區是有自由的話，還有什麼爭鬥，可以對敵的呢？羅馬人在歌聲中，與希臘人携手，因爲在節拍的音調裏，血脈是一樣地跳動，呼吸是一樣地激昂！</p>
<p>『願望』在無窮盡的前程，他好像是一隻飛鳥，在那天涯海角的邊際，留下歷史的殘痕！</p>
<h3>關於舞踊藝術</h3>
<p>— 叔孫如瑩</p>
<p>舞踊藝術，在今日的中國，很少有人耕耘。吳曉邦先生，與最近在上海表演的戴愛蓮女士，便是這極少數人中的兩個最有成就的人，他們爲中國荒蕪的藝壇增添了一些可貴的光輝。然而，偌大的中國，只有兩個舞踊藝術家，未免太少得可憐。不但此也，在我們這古文明的國度，能看得懂舞踊，能了解舞踊，能欣賞舞踊的人，又有多少？</p>
<p>舞踊是怎樣一種藝術？要作精深的論述也許要寫成一部書吧，這裏僅願以數百字的說明，給舞踊藝術繪出一個輪廓。</p>
<p>舞踊，是一種綜合藝術。第一，它是時間藝術與空間藝術的綜合：它不像一張畫那樣，可以讓你一覽無餘，又不像詩歌，只訴之於你心靈上的視覺。它同時佔有空間，佔有時間，它在時間裏作空間之運動。第二，它是音樂與姿態，動作的綜合：差不多一切舞踊，都以複雜的（如交響樂）或簡單的（如鼓鈸）音樂來伴奏，在動作，姿態之中，把音樂的旋律，節奏，情趣表現了出來。第三，它是各種藝術元素的綜合：舉凡綫條，色彩，形體，節奏，旋律，詩意各種藝術元素，莫不包涵在內。</p>
<p>因此，一個舞踊藝術家首先要有一個經過嚴格訓練的身體，這嚴格訓練，使他的身體能接受精微的控制，每一塊肌肉部要能盡情的鬆弛，叉要能盡情的硬直。一個舞踊家的腿臂，要能慢慢的屈伸，能隨着任何變幻的樂曲變動速度。要能　，能跑，能跳，一切人類軀體的動作，都要能控制於音樂的的束之內。其次，舞踊家要了解音樂，這樣，他扌能把他的舞姿與音樂融爲一體。所謂舞踊，也就是有形的音樂，凝固的音樂，因此，對音樂了解不够的人便不能在舞踊上有較高的成就。再次，一切藝術離不開人生，藝踊也決不例外，舞踊家要了解人生，對人生有深切的認識，那麽，他的舞踊扌有內容，扌有意義。能以技巧完美的舞踊表現出人生的眞諦的人，扌眞是偉大的藝術</p>
<p>占代的　　，不論在東方，在西方，都有　同的特點，它的目的主要的是表現人類生活。在古代有一　戰舞，便是以表揚　主題。在十八世紀前後，舞踊　經沒落到宅　容的地步了，只有一些固定的動作與姿態，崇尙華貴與典雅，於是舞踊威爲死氣沉沉的廟堂藝術，成了少數人賞心悅目的玩具。近代舞踊復甦是始於鄧肯女士，雖然她一生的羅曼諦克的事蹟使我們這不脫淸敎徒思想的國民們有所誤解，但她在舞踊藝術上的功績眞是難以磨滅。她接受了一切古典舞踊的技巧，但這些古典的技巧在她那兒得到了解放，她開始赤足，開始用那不是舞曲的樂曲來舞踊，她第一個用身體的運動與姿態來表現一個生活着的人的思想與情感。於是近代舞產生了，舞踊藝術復甦了。</p>
<p>在中國，近代舞踊是吳曉邦先生與戴愛蓮女士介紹了過來的。他們不但介紹了西洋與日本的近代舞，更在努力於中國民族舞踊的發掘與創造，戴女士的提倡民間舞自然是有其意義的。但願他們耕耘不再是一種徒勞，但願從此上海人了解什麽是舞踊藝術</p>
<h3>論模仿</h3>
<p>— 阿龍</p>
<p>目前寫文章的人似乎很不少，這在文藝的前途上說，是很可樂觀的。但是，仔細地將報章雜誌翻閱了一下，常有文章抄襲論，這一類題目發見。過若干日子就有反駁的文章刋了出來，於是，文壇　閙非凡，加以搖旗吶喊的，的確成爲一齣全武行。</p>
<p>而這齣精彩節目的結果，都是「不了了之」的，編者先生或者第三者就會寫篇把文章出來　解，調解的方汰是不說抄襲，也不是完全創作，只算受點影響，風格上的模仿</p>
<p>這種論調我是相當贊成的·記得幾年前曾有人高呼『我們需要接受文學遺產」的口號。這意思就是說，我們吸收了古人的精華，而後扌能創造出更優良的作品來。</p>
<p>人不是生來就是萬能的，起初　要別人扶養，對於自己生活上的必須之動作應該學習，應該模仿，直到能够運用自如，能够自己謀生爲止。而文學也是這樣的，不過我們不應該死板板的模仿，我們允其不應該生呑活剝的抄襲；東鱗西爪地剽竊，吾則就失去了意義。</p>
<p>梭羅訶夫的靜靜的頓河是受了託爾斯泰的影響；蕭伯納的黑女求神記雖有若千地方是模仿福爾泰的，但是，這只是模仿風格，不影響作品整個價値的。</p>
<p>至於有些作品顯然的採用名作有的情節，甚至於剽竊別人創造的人格，這種內在的模仿如同作品失去了靈魂。沒有靈魂的東西自然不會有所貢獻的。雖然我們不能肯定的設作者是以某某流行的名作爲藍本，但是這總是美中不足。</p>
<p>這裏，我要奉勸抄襲的人們：你們要多讀，多經騐。這樣，在不知不覺中，你們會得到那些書中以及現實生活中寳貴的部份，而融化了它。以後，非但落筆容易，而作品也會比較成功些。</p>
<h3>論藝術中的頽廢派　托爾斯泰的藝術論</h3>
<p>— 劉賢亞</p>
<p>藝術因爲上等階級的無信仰，而內容遂以貧乏，並且因爲他越來越特別，所以越來越複雜，越不明白，越講究門面。因此類似這樣的藝術品只爲處於特別狀態下的少數階級，或只爲蒲一人及其從者——　國王，大公，王妃等，這種的藝術作品所表現的不爲衆人所明白，而只求以　諷爲常事的人一方面的了解，第一，用這種方法便能够說得多些；第二，這種表現的方法在特種階級一方面覺着有曖昧的特別美觀。這種方法漸漸行用起來，至其終極便成爲頽廢派藝術了。</p>
<p>在頽廢派之下的藝術，多以曖昧溢露在藝術的作品上面，因此許多的詩家就共同的遵守這個定理了。並且有許多藝術家，他們都根據尼采，瓦格奈的意思，以爲他們所爲不應使愚蠢的衆人得以明白，而應當引起有學問人詩味的狀態；這種人英國美學家叫做——最自然的人——（Bestnurtlred　Men）</p>
<p>當時頽廢派中間所最尊崇的要算鮑特萊爾和魏倫。在他們的詩歌散文本的作品中，我們簡直不能明瞭它的意思，現在姑把鮑氏所著的「不相識者」照錄於下：</p>
<p>「隱謎的人，你愛誰：你父親呢，你母親呢，你兄弟呢，你妹妹呢？</p>
<p>我沒有父母，也沒有兄弟姊妹。愛你的朋友麽？</p>
<p>你用的字，他的意義我到現在還不曉得。愛你的祖國麽？</p>
<p>我不知道他在多少緯度上，愛美麽？</p>
<p>如果他是女神並且不死，那我極願意愛他。愛金麽？</p>
<p>我仇恨他，彷彿你仇恨上帝似的。唉奇怪的不相識者，你到愛什麼？</p>
<p>我愛雲……那邊經過的雲，奇妙的雲……」這「不相識者」是簽麽意思？是甚　會事？實在使我們完全不明白。因此我們覺得爲什麼頽廢派里許多的藝術家，他們却都尊崇鮑特萊爾和魏倫。</p>
<p>至於鮑特萊爾的人生觀是本粗魯的「爲已主義」作學說而把道德代以「美」及「藝術的美」不確定的意義。鮑氏看重化裝的婦人面貌甚於婦人的本來面目，又看重鐵樹和劇塲上的假山水甚於天然之物。</p>
<p>魏倫的人生觀在於凋萎的溶解，在於認自己道德的無力，在於崇拜加特立敎以救其無力。</p>
<p>他們兩人不但缺乏眞實，誠懇和樸實，還充滿了僞擬，奇癖和自尊。但是他們的學說還引起許多的藝術人讚和，這是什麼原因呢？托爾斯泰說：要解釋這個現象只要一句話：「這些詩人所處社會要的藝術並不是生活上正當並且重要的事情，都衹是游　。」</p>
<p>總括起來說：好的大的，普遍的的藝術，不明白的人不過是小部份的惡劣階級，而決不是大多數樸實淸潔的勞動人民，藝術所以使大多數人民不能不明白的，因爲它是好的。同時也可以說藝術所以使大多數不能明白的，因爲它是不好的，或者簡直不是　術。</p>
<p>因此，我們就知道頹廢派的藝術是「爲已主義」的「不明白」的藝術；也就是托爾斯泰所說的「不好」或且「簡直不是藝術」，這問題也可以擴充到通俗藝術的範　內，來討論不通俗　術的問題了。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「您哪……？」一個年輕的夥計，穿　翠藍布大褂迎了上來，朦朧的澄光，依然把他大襟上一個深紅的「5」字映顯出來，上面還有四個字，排出很整齊的半圓形，大的就是「××飯店」。</p>
<p>「借光……太晚了的，不是嗎？」來人微笑着。</p>
<p>「……六樓還有一小間，您對勁嗎？」</p>
<p>「好的……這兒不就有六層嗎？…越高越好。」</p>
<p>「請，您哪。一小夥子說着，便側着身子，在前面引路。</p>

<p>這座建築，原是北平一家頭等飯店，自從反間諜工作到了擴張階段，這　就成了北區行動總站。飯店的主持人，本是一位革命前强，而飯店又是一種藏龍臥虎的絕　掩蔽，所以在這裏佈置一個總站，頗稱適宜。底層至五樓，仍舊是普通旅社營業性質。六樓全部扌是眞正發號施令的所在，却又佈置得毫無一絲痕跡。</p>
<p>到了第六樓，我會見了總部的主持人w君。一見面您就看得出他是一位極其能幹，豪爽，而又極端機警的人。</p>
<p>「歡迎」歡迎……兄弟代表敝局最高主持人及執行總主任，歡迎先生光臨。」國語裏帶着很重的南方口音。</p>
<p>我也代表鶴見說了兩句客氣話；同時又把從長辛來，路上的種種麻煩和驚險，的略說明。</p>
<p>「『七封秘槭』現在到了什麽階段了？」w君單刀直入了。</p>
<p>「先打算把內容　出來，然後再想辦法。」</p>
<p>「有把握嗎？」</p>
<p>「試試看，可是危險性很大。」我想起鶴見匆匆出伐的那一幕。</p>
<p>「大的總有充分的佈置吧？」</p>
<p>「當然，可是對方的佈置也很嚴密呢！」</p>
<p>「K君……」w君在斟酌怎樣發問；大的他很急於要知道鶴見的身世。</p>
<p>「是的，黃花崗主動分子之一的後人</p>
<p>「　？」他瞧了　手腕上的時計；「難怪……原來……」表示驚訝。</p>
<p>「毫無一點疑義，……可是知道這件事的，先生是第三人！」我很愼重的說明了這一個要點。</p>
<p>「他本人怎樣證實的呢？」他拿起了直線電話，「對不起，時間不早了，我們還得去會見紀女士，不是嗎？」他對我道數，「……喂，……預備兩部車子，第二部距離五十碼。」放下了電話，w君又在一排六隻電絲的第一隻上按了一下。</p>
<p>「他的尊大人就是古永昶」，我繼續說明鶴見的出身；「老同盟會員名册上大槪可以査明。黃花崗舉義之後，他的令尊令堂兩位，同到日本避難，住在長崎居留地。不到一月就生了一個孩子。就是古君。同時，他的令堂，因爲產後勞悴，就去世了。……」</p>
<p>這時門上有人輕輕敲了兩下，沒有等到「請進」的回答，門已經開了。一位靑年，穿着很整齊的制服，走進房內，隨手將門　上了；瞧　w君行了一個軍禮。</p>
<p>「請分派四位輪値的同志，上第二部東子，保持五十碼距離的戒備。一w君說畢，舉了舉手。靑年應了「是」，行了禮，轉身出去了。態度十分的嚴蕭。這一點上，我看明了中國再生的佳兆。</p>

<h3>糖的行列</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>桂子飄香，秋風容易，秋老虎的尾勢雖勁，人們的心情畢竟走向淸爽。宜人的天氣，收穫的時季，上海是個消費與生產競賽最猛烈的都市，吃吃花花，想方設法謙一票，都得打疊起精神來也。</p>
<p>每逢令節倍思糖，例不分中外。原因大概由於糖是甜的，甜又屬於歡樂的原故。中秋須大啖月餅，用糖甚多，糖節的意味也就格外濃厚了。可惜馬路上尙未出現良鄕魁栗的攤子，南北交通阻礙，使我們缺少此佳果點綴佳節，眞是掃興之至！而炒栗又是需要糖的一種食物。</p>
<p>於此，我們才恍然於最近糖的糾紛之嚴重，以及欠家奔競於糖的所由來！</p>
<p>每一爿南貨店門前，都簇擁著一堆伸手嘶叫的人羣，有時排成行列，足足延長到兩三千米突。可是這一塲面中的人物，他們或她們面孔上所表現的，不是甜迷迷，而是苦兮兮，不是喜悅，而是煩躁。是的，苦兮兮在追求甜迷迷，煩躁在追求喜悅哩！</p>
<p>上海的糖大都從合灣來的，直到今日爲止，我們吃的還是過去台灣的存糖，其中正含有無數血汙，但這又非吃糖人所能想及。據說台　的蔗田大都荒廢，明年產量頗成問題，如此一來，明年此日，糖的行列恐怕要排到台灣了，是否能人各一斤呢？也很難說。</p>
<p>有人說，別慌，古巴糖會來的。</p>
<p>生活隨筆</p>
<h3>開門七件之一：買限價糖</h3>
<p>— 心齊</p>
<p>某天傍晚，隔壁的×師母。過來坐着閒談。她說：「×師母，今天南貨店裏有限價糖賣，每斤八百六十元，每人可購兩斤，貨色和馬路旁賣美國貨攤販的車糖完全一樣，比了南貨店裏平日賣的白糖潔凈得多。據說以後每兩星期配售一次，…」弟妹們聽了皆大歡喜。</p>
<p>幾天後，報上果然刋載着第八期第九期限價糖配售的消息：零售每斤八百二十元，每人限購三斤，較那天×師母說的，還賤了四十元。</p>
<p>十四日午後一時，到附近一家南貨店去買限價糖，看見早已有二百人左右在排演着長蛇陣，想來今天決不會有我買的希望，所以立刑轉回家來，吿訴母親：「今天太擠了！姑俟明天買吧？」</p>
<p>翌日，下班回家正好是十二點鐘。我對母親說：「給我留」些飯，讓我去買了糖回來吃飯。」可見走去一看，原來又站着七八十人的行列了！爲了這八百二十元一斤的糖，實在是便宜，我也就挨次排着。在我後面一下子就有百來個。</p>
<p>配售時間到了。站在最前面櫃台旁的，嚷着：「時間到了爲什麽不賣？」起初夥計們還回答說：「稍等一下。」後來嚷多了夥計們述睬也不睞，儘做着別的生意，有的自在地昂着頭搖着扇子。</p>
<p>轉瞬間一點半了，依舊沒有開始發售！前面嚷着一片，後面站的也都作不平之嗚。好容易聽得高喊一聲，『大家站齊了不要擠，開始賣了。」於是大家胸貼着背，背貼着胸，像算盤子似的緊靠着。每個人的胸前背後衣服上，都濕了。</p>
<p>「三斤，三斤，…」兩三個伙計忙碌着：數鈔票，找錢，稱糖，包紥…。半個鐘點過去了，僅走去了二三十個，輪到我買遠得站上一小時。這時見弟妹跑來，「×哥，母親叫你買不到不要買了，回去吃飯，因爲你三鐘點還要去上辦公的。」但已經站了兩個鐘點，雖然規定三點鐘停售，或許尙有希望買到，這樣走開了，未免可惜。乃對弟妹說：「那麼你們替我站着，買三斤帶回來。」</p>
<p>黃昏，我自辦公地方回家，　藝　　　　債的口　說　「×哥，我們站到三點鐘，前面僅剩七八個了；那知店裏的伙計說，時間已到，明天再賣。」</p>
<p>第三天，坐在辦公室裏兀自想着：「今天公事不多，動作加快些，一小時多就可辦完；不如提早下班，下午再請假休息半天，好去等候買糖。否則明天最末一天，買糖的情形必定更爲困難。」計議定了，提早下班。</p>
<p>回家來，母親驚異着問：「怎麼這早…？」我沒有等她說完，接着就說：「爲了買糖呀！」看錶上十一點還差一刻，走到南貨店去，啊！更有比我耐心好的，已經又有十多人候着了。</p>
<p>三小時的日光浴，的確有些不易消受，但是終於給我捧着一包三斤重的限價糖走回家來。</p>
<h3>公園</h3>
<p>— 菖蒲</p>
<p>時節雖已入秋，但週來氣候仍停滯在華氏九十多度左右。吃過晚餐之後，因爲上海房屋鱗次櫛比，沒有地方去納凉，所以想蹓躂到公園裏去。希望一舒日間的辛勞。</p>
<p>買了門票，進入了××公園，竟使我大失所望。園內野草沒脛，靠椅的橫檔木脫落，草地上的靑草也少了大半，泥方斑斑駁駁的露了出來。祇見許多露着上身，赤胸無鞋的兒童在草地上踢皮球，於是我土知草地上所以沒有靑草的原因。路旁，樹旁，籬笆旁，許多兒童拿着瓦罐在捉蟋蟀，弄得鋪在地上的整齊的磚石許多翻了身，樹根露出泥外，籬笆折斷。走到花圃旁一看，花是有的，竟是幾朶野生的蒲公英及野菊在點綴着。兒童公園內的盪鞦韆及蹺蹺板等也祇賸了空架子了。植物園中本來有許多花木的，現在也乏人修剪，以致大半枯萎不堪。風起時，沒有草的草地上的泥沙全都飛揚起來，於是公園內泥沙蔽空，對面不見人，嚇得我連忙逃出來。</p>
<p>記得戰前上海的公園還整理得相當可以的，爲什麼勝利後反會荒蕪如此呢？上海本來祇有幾個小公園，如果再任其荒蕪，不加修理，則上海將會變成沒有公園的大都會，這才是世界上的奇蹟呢！</p>
<h3>低調</h3>
<p>— 三公</p>
<p>周起因控大衆夜報而被正式檢舉，一昨又見報載曾任僞官之陳永輝因向西人索詐而亦被拘到忠字監。這兩位「聰明人」都可說是「自扳磚頭自壓脚」；常　道；「聰明反被聰明誤」旣有過去之「誤一自難保無今日之「誤」。眞是「一誤再誤」？</p>
<p>最近電車中接連演出糾紛；軍人打售票員當然軍紀要整飭，但是一部份售票員對乘客的能度欠佳，似乎亦有加以改善必要。</p>
<p>見義勇爲的榮　了亞軍的「小姐」，似乎已忘懷了乃父在縲絏中。於是乎有人說道這倒合乎一種中國固有的精神—「大義滅親」。</p>
<p>電車似乎是起點和終點的乘客的專利品，因爲中間的站頭有的雖設而不停，有的停而擠不上。道才叫做「貫澈始終」？</p>
<h3>我們愛護軍紀</h3>
<p>— 崇貞</p>
<p>從售票員被打說起</p>
<p>海軍士兵爲了要電車不到站即停，未達目的，竟然動手大打售票員，我們不能緘默。而且私自拘捕售票員挾入營中痛打，把梁光輝打得奄奄一息，試問這還成什麼體統？</p>
<p>我們認爲受過訓練的肇事士兵們，未免太輕視紀律了，「軍紀者軍隊之命脈也。」此爲軍人之本色，難道受訓的結果速自己的本色都忘了嗎！而且電車必須到站而停，盡人皆知，難道連這也不知道？我們很記得海軍在抗戰中的功績，我們很盼望新海軍的建立，但是這一次事件却重重地影響了一般對海軍的祟敬和希望。—雖然，絕對多數的海軍都不會要電車不到站即停，而繼之以動武。稍可吿慰者：海軍方面的業寳琪營長，視軍紀如泰山，已堅決表示兇手鄭福林等四人，業已禁閉，將交軍法處審理，如被書人不治身死，則允將兇手正法。我們相信這話一定會兌現。因爲對於兇手的懲罰並不是一種報復，而是愛護海軍的軍紀。我們愛護海軍。所以我們如此說。</p>
<h3>有了答案</h3>
<p>— 廷</p>
<p>由於電車售票員被打事件，我想起了一件事情：有一次跑到×軍駐滬辦事處去，因爲我想直接向傳達室投名刺，（事實上我已去過幾次，都是到傳達室的）沒有先向衛兵招呼，於是一個衛兵就毫不留情地問我「受過敎育沒有？」</p>
<p>當時我沒有答復，想不到現在却有人自告奮勇地答復了這問題。</p>

<h3>連環漫書　三毛從軍記（九四）</h3>
<p>— 張樂平作</p>
<h3>投考瑣記</h3>
<p>— 過來人</p>
<p>參加過交通及曁南兩校的入學考試，不能無記。下面的想着便寫，不拘次序，還請閱者原諒。</p>
<p>交大理化素來很難，今年却很容易。英文國文史地更不必說。但數學實在太難了！很有許多人上了第一天理化題的常，以爲數學不會十分難，結果却大出意外。交白卷的人很多，考得出而只有零分的，定也不少。</p>
<p>試塲外有人在說：「交大入學考試錄取的標準，一年比一年低」。又有人說：今年考生雖多，錄取標準，決不會提高，因爲一般成絨，並不很好」。是否準確，須看揭曉。</p>
<p>交大的知行服務處，厥功甚偉，我考曁南是在震旦大學，在你口渴得沒法而向門房買鮮橘水的時候，想到知行的聞水供應，眞是無量功德！</p>
<p>曁大的物理試題，有一題是不用鐵器，要你辨別「執是磁鐵，孰非磁鐵』。但考卷繕寫員把「孰」字寫作「熟」字。我起初還當要辨別「是熟磁鐵，非熟磁　」。不禁　暗吃驚。</p>
<p>曁南數學，較交大的便當得多。共四題（交大爲六題）二係解析幾何，一係平面幾何，一係大代數。但這裏有可商　者二：（鄙人幸能做出，下文不是牢騷）：</p>
<p>招生簡章上數學項下，理學院只試大代數解析幾何及三角。爲何三角不考而考平面幾何？結果許多人—差不多金體人—都沒預備，話又要說回來了，題目很便當，只要初中讀過三S平而幾何的，都應該做得出：</p>
<p>數學老試之後，操塲上充滿了怨恨之聲。一位同學憤怒地說：「出道題目的人，眞厥德！</p>
<p>有人慨然地說：「交大的題目眞痛快，情願考零分也値得。曁南的題目，不痛不癢，做得出而做不好」。</p>
<p>大學投考指南，差不多人手一册。最多的一種是于澄所編的又大又厚的一本。簡直沒一個人帶敎科書的。學生也學會了投機，只擇捷徑，不由正道，我國敎育的趨勢，到底是高超，是破產？</p>
<p>嚴格的說，上海的學生，並不最多譬譬如這次考曁大就看見許多同考交大的熟面孔。我有個同學，已考過西南聯大，廈門及交通，他吿訴我，他們許多同班畢業的人，已約好一同去考武漢，中央，唐山，和浙大。單是這十數人，已要細　　飾之多　　　　要　　　　人數怎慶翁不　麗</p>

<h3>National Army Vanguard Enters Chifeng; Du Yuming Flies to Rehe for Inspection; Jidong Recovers Xianghe and Sanhe Counties</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 5th] Commander Du Yuming flew to Rehe on the morning of the 5th for inspection.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 5th] Military authorities confirmed today that the National Army entered Chifeng yesterday, but as of this morning, street fighting is still ongoing. The National Army in Chengde is clearing the surrounding areas, and the National Army advancing south from Chengde has approached Gubeikou.

It is said that the National Army may join forces at Gubeikou tonight or tomorrow. More than 2,000 reinforcements arrived from the northwest this morning. The recovery of the Pinggu Line has begun from Miyun and is progressing northward.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 5th] According to a military official, the distance between Chengde Gubeikou and the bandits is long, with towering mountains, and the Communist army has a considerable number between Chengde and Gubeikou, so the progress of the National Army advancing south from Chengde has not been too rapid. The encirclement battle in eastern Hebei has already begun. The National Army along the Great Wall line is stationed in the Yiyuankou coastal area and is engaged in fierce fighting near Leting. Sanhe, Xianghe, and Midi, along the Bei Canal, are also in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 5th] The mopping-up operation by the National Army in eastern Hebei is progressing favorably. It is reported that the National Army has recovered the county towns of Xianghe and Sanhe, as well as Maqidai and Zhahe Villages. Therefore, in addition to the National Army east of the Beining Road having gained control of Leting, the center of the plain in that area, the National Army is developing in the triangular mountainous area west of the road from the Beining Road in the east and Xianghe and Sanhe in the west. Mou Tingfang went to Tangshan at 2:00 PM today, and it is rumored that he will set up a temporary command post there.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Ceaselessly Attacks Datong; National Army Will Attack Zhangjiakou</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 5th] After Chen Cheng explained that Zhangjiakou and Rehe are the same battlefield, this reporter visited a certain authority today. It is reported that if the Communist army does not stop its attack on Datong within one or two days, the National Army will recover Zhangjiakou within a week or ten days. It is also claimed that the government not only has the determination but also the certainty to do so. In addition, it is learned that the Pingsui Line and the Pingcheng Line have started operations simultaneously. This reporter inquired about this matter with the Communist Party spokesperson here, who said that the Communist army's attack on Datong is to contain the Jinan battle, so they have not considered stopping the operation, and hinted that the Communist army in Zhangjiakou is waiting in full battle array.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 5th] The Chinese Communists issued a provocative reply to Chief of Staff Chen Cheng's statement yesterday that Zhangjiakou is the National Army's main target. According to the Xinhua News Agency today, General Chen Cheng's remarks yesterday are consistent with the memorandum from General Xiang Jiemin, the government representative of the Beiping Military Mediation Headquarters, to General Ye Jianying, the Communist Party representative. Chen Cheng has clearly pointed out that the next target of the government army is Zhangyuan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 5th] The Jibei Railway Station's engine section in the same city was fiercely attacked by the Communist army on the 4th, and poison gas was released, eventually leading to its fall.

(5) The 37th and 38th Regiments of the 13th Field Brigade, with 2,000 men, are stationed in the Qilicun area south of the city, with the main force concentrated northeast of the city.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 4th] A report on the 4th carried a Beijing-Shanghai dispatch stating that the Communist army had invaded and occupied Datong. According to Chief of Staff Wang of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, the headquarters received three telegrams on the afternoon of the 4th from Chu Hanchun, the commander-in-chief of the Datong garrison, reporting on the military situation and requesting supplies of food, ammunition, and medical equipment. There was also an intelligence report stating that Nie Rongzhen, acting on Zhu De's instructions, was besieging Datong, with a deadline of one week from the 1st and a deadline of three days to capture the station, and began attacking the city on the 4th. This shows that the city of Datong was safe and sound until the Hai hour on the 3rd.</p>
<h3>Communist Army's Repeated Fierce Attacks Repelled; National Army Firmly Defends Haian Town; Counterattack in Western Shandong Continues to Recover Caoxian</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The Communist army besieging Haian has a force of approximately 12,000 men. On the morning of the 3rd, they launched an attack with their main force on the National Army positions outside the west gate. Under the cover of dense artillery fire, they charged three times but were repelled by the National Army. They launched another fierce attack in the evening, and after fierce fighting until the morning of the 4th, they were finally repelled. In this battle, the Communist army was attacked head-on, with more than 400 killed and more than 200 bodies left behind.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jiangdu, 5th] The Communist army's offensive centered on Haian is already exhausted. The Communist army in Dongtai is committing all its strength to attack Haian, determined to take it. The National Army, in order to defend Liangtai, is also bound to defend it firmly. The battle for the town has been going on for several days. The Communist army around Haian is littered with corpses. This reporter received a phone call from the front line in Taixian this afternoon, stating that the town is still under the control of the National Army.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 5th] According to an official telegram from Taixian on the 4th, the Communist army besieging Haian, with a force of twelve regiments, used mountain guns and mortars to bombard the National Army positions and the earth city on the 4th, followed by infantry charges.

<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 5th] The people of Ningyang, unable to bear the harassment of the Communist army, spontaneously organized the Ningyang People's Self-Defense Corps and rose up to resist, and have now occupied Ningyang County.</p>
<h3>National Army in Shanxian, Southern Shandong, Seizes Communist Army Documents</h3>
<p>Extremely Absurd Slander of the Government</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 5th] According to reports, the National Army seized Communist army documents in Shanxian, southern Shandong, including Mao Zedong's letter to Communist Party members, encouraging his comrades to prepare for a twelve-year long struggle, and vigorously slandering the government with extremely absurd language, which shows his deep-seated ambition to betray the country, and the so-called peace is purely a smokescreen.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Lurks in Jiangnan; Disguised to Probe Military Intelligence</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jiangyin Correspondent] The Communist army has recently been lurking and active in the Jiangnan area. The Communist Party's Huazhong Salt Administration and cooperative societies in various counties have dispatched cadres disguised as salt merchants to probe military affairs and contact lurking accomplices. People in the recovered areas are not allowed to enter their areas, and people in the Communist army's area are not allowed to leave the country without their special permission. People's letters in that area must be brought to the post office in person to purchase stamps and can only be sent out after inspection.</p>
<h3>Li Mo'an to Go to Cheng to Convene Important Meeting Today</h3>

<h3>Ambassador Stuart Expresses Views Yesterday, Clarifying the Purpose of Selling Surplus Materials, Aspiring to Help Us Improve People's Lives</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Ambassador Stuart Leighton said to reporters on the 5th regarding the informal small group meeting: Special Envoy Marshall is only in an assisting position, and he himself is still responsible. Ambassador has not expressed his opinion on the two prerequisites insisted upon by the Communist Party, because he and Special Envoy Marshall are still expecting a turning point and hope that the small group meeting can proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 5th] Ambassador Stuart issued a statement today, sternly refuting the claim that the United States' transfer of surplus materials to China would fuel the civil war. He said: The sale of these materials to China is out of goodwill, intended to benefit the entire China, not favoring one party, and moreover, if these surplus materials are not transferred to China, they will be useless.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Today's newspaper carried a message that "Ambassador Stuart protested against the Communist Party's accusations that the ambassador discussed the sale of surplus U.S. military materials with Peterson in Shanghai." According to Fu Jingbo, Ambassador Stuart's personal advisor, there was no such thing and it should be corrected. As for the matter itself, the ambassador explained that this trip to Shanghai had nothing to do with the agreement on the transfer of materials and that he did not meet with Peterson. The amount of surplus materials this time is very large and cannot be sent back to the United States, so it is transferred to China, but it is definitely not used for civil war, but to help improve the lives of the Chinese people.</p>
<h3>US Congressman Arrives in Shanghai, Transfers to Philippines, Issues Statement in Beiping Accusing Soviet Attempts, Demanding US Take a Stronger Stance</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 5th] The U.S. House Military Committee Pacific Inspection Group, led by Representative Short, ended its schedule in Beiping and is scheduled to fly to Shanghai at 9:00 AM on the 6th, and then transfer to Manila for inspection.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 5th] Members of the U.S. House Military Committee stated: The United States should take a tougher stance towards the Soviet Union; otherwise, if China fails to solve its domestic problems, the United States may become a scapegoat. Because the United States has taken on the role of mediator between the National Government and the Chinese Communist Party, the large-scale civil war that has broken out in China will inevitably be blamed on the United States. According to Representative Sikes, a Democratic Congressman and spokesperson for the committee, Special Envoy Marshall and the personnel he brought to assist in resolving the China problem are currently undertaking the great task of sacrificing themselves without pleasing anyone, but their efforts are now being hampered by the intransigence of the two parties in China. The failure of negotiations to resolve the Chinese dispute is largely due to Soviet influence, and the Chinese Communist Party, "due to orders from above or the irresponsibility of military leaders," has violated the ceasefire order in North China and the Northeast. The Soviet Union's attempt to control the whole of China is underway, and once successful, we can prepare to withdraw completely from the East. Since the United States is concerned about world peace, it cannot condone such a state of affairs.</p>
<h3>Military Subsistence Allowance Canceled; Physical Objects to be Distributed According to Regulations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The Joint Logistics Headquarters announced new regulations for the supply of the army in September. The subsistence allowance for each division after reorganization will no longer be issued, and physical objects will be distributed according to regulations.</p>
<h3>Gui Yongqing Pays Respects to the Chairman</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guling, 5th] Gui Yongqing, head of the military delegation stationed in Germany, paid his respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for the first time after returning to China to report on his duties. Gui flew to Guling with Chief of Staff Chen on the same plane.</p>
<h3>The First Collaboration Between Chinese and American Films: "America Through Chinese Eyes" to be Filmed, Directed by Sun Yu, and Jin Yan Invited to the United States</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, New York Special Correspondent, 4th] American Planet Films is preparing to collaborate with famous Chinese film director Sun Yu to produce a film, which will be the first collaboration between Chinese and American filmmakers. The film is titled "America Through Chinese Eyes," written and directed by Sun Yu. Li Lili, a famous Chinese star who has been living in New York for a year, will play a female reporter in the film. Planet Films has telegraphed Jin Yan, a film star currently in Shanghai, to rush to the United States to participate in the drama, and the remaining American actors are being selected by Planet Films.</p>
<h3>Communist Party Coldly Responds, Stalling the Situation; The Five-Person Meeting is a Distant Prospect; Marshall and Stuart Jointly Meet with Zhou Enlai Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The convening of the informal small group meeting is a distant prospect and seems to be aborted. However, Ambassador Stuart and Special Envoy Marshall are still making a final effort. At 10:00 AM on the 5th, Special Envoy Marshall visited Ambassador Stuart for an hour, reportedly to study the crux of the problem of the two prerequisites put forward by the Communist Party. After Special Envoy Marshall returned to his residence, he met with Yu Dawei, who said that he would not express any opinions, as he was not visiting as a representative of the government, but for other matters. He said at the end: The government is still very sincere and tolerant in seeking peace.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Zhou Enlai visited Special Envoy Marshall at 4:30 PM on the 5th. Ambassador Stuart arrived one hour earlier, and the three immediately held talks until 7:30 PM, when the ambassador left for the embassy and went to another private appointment. Zhou and Marshall talked until 8:00 PM and had dinner together, and Zhou did not return until 9:15 PM. According to a spokesperson for the Chinese Communist delegation, the theme of today's talks was still the two prerequisites, and he said that if there is a guarantee of a ceasefire, the reorganization of the government can also be submitted to the Political Consultative Conference for resolution, but the government has not yet responded, and today's talks have not yielded any results, and the small group meeting will not be able to be mentioned.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] This reporter visited Secretary-General Wu Techeng on the evening of the 5th, who said: We are still waiting for Zhou Enlai, waiting for the meeting to come. The creation of this delay should be the responsibility of the Communist Party. A certain foreigner said: I think there will always be a way, and the stalemate will not last long.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The informal five-person small group meeting has not formally convened as of the evening of the 5th. Government representatives and U.S. Ambassador Stuart are waiting quietly. The prelude to the talks has just begun, and due to the Communist Party's cold attitude towards participating in the talks, it is showing a trend of being shelved. Communist representative Zhou Enlai, after talking with Special Envoy Marshall at length on the evening of the 4th, declared that "the situation is serious and there are no results." The Communist spokesperson also said yesterday that the United States signed a huge amount of sales of surplus U.S. materials with the government at this time, which is enough to help expand the civil war. It is heard that the Chinese Communist Party has protested this matter to Special Envoy Marshall. From the above signs, it can be pointed out that there are still many clouds before the formal start of the talks, but Ambassador Stuart still has great hope for the future of the talks. Special Envoy Marshall visited the ambassador at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 5th for one and a half hours. In the afternoon at 4:30, Marshall and Stuart jointly met with Zhou at Special Envoy Marshall's residence. When the ambassador left at 7:00, Marshall and Zhou were still continuing the talks. Zhou did not leave until 9:00.</p>
<h3>Central Agencies Draft Next Year's Budget</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The budget for central agencies for the next year can be decided in October. Several agencies have submitted budget drafts to the Executive Yuan, but local budgets have been drafted slightly slower due to financial reforms. According to sources, next year's fiscal revenue mainly relies on tax revenue and state-owned enterprises. The handling of enemy and puppet industries is expected to be completed within the year. Even if it cannot be completed on schedule, this revenue will not be listed as an important item in the new budget.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Guling, 5th] The Youth League National Congress will hold its fifth meeting on the 6th, which will enter the discussion stage. The central issue is to determine the nature of the League. It is heard that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Chief of Staff Chen Cheng both intend to preside in person to listen to the opinions of the representatives.

Ai Sha then gave a supplementary report on frontier league affairs and passed the following resolutions: (1) Former Secretary-General Zhang Zhizhong's autonomous new administration has greatly benefited the youth of the frontier, and the congress should send a telegram to express its condolences.

<h3>Minister Bai, on Behalf of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Inspects the Nanjing Parachute Corps; All Performances Achieve Outstanding Results</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] On the 5th, Minister Bai inspected the Parachute Corps on behalf of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The location was the Transportation School outside Zhonghua Gate. The grand review ceremony began at 8:00 AM. When this reporter joined the ranks of the review officers and marched to this group of special soldiers to the sound of the bugle, I looked up at the fluttering national flag, reflecting the green mountains, fully expressing the vitality of new life. Minister Bai led the way, and all the review officers followed him under the autumn sun. Minister Bai said to reporters very happily, this is an emerging arm of the military, worthy of promotion, and paratroopers will occupy a very important position in future wars. Bai also inquired about the soldiers' physical lives, always with a smile on his face, giving a feeling of kindness. After the review, we visited various equipment parachutes, equipment bags, equipment barrels, and various application tools, and made detailed adjustments. A demonstration was given for the folding umbrella item. After the indoor visit, there was a dynamic demonstration of the basic training of paratroopers, such as jumping out of the aircraft door, rolling exercises, landing training, umbrella hanging racks, three-dimensional models, and skydiving. Then a realistic battlefield unfolded before you. This item is called battlefield psychological test, using landmine explosions, hand grenades, smoke screens, machine guns, and various weapons with barbed wire. At the beginning, I only saw piles of yellow, green, and black smoke rising from various strongholds, immediately obscuring the soldiers who were crawling forward and about to cross the barbed wire. The beautiful smoke formation thickened and lasted for a long time, and the continuous sounds of machine guns and cannons resounded through the mountains, and bullets flew across the low sky. The reporter, who was watching the battle, temporarily acted as a war correspondent, with a restless soul. There were many more performances to follow. After walking for three hours under the scorching sun, everyone was mentally exhausted when they returned indoors. Bai asked: "Do you think it's easy to be a soldier?" The reporter replied: "I would collapse if I did it for one day." Bai laughed loudly. In fact, the reporter had already been unable to support it. From 1:00 PM onwards, there were also skydiving performances, with even more exciting programs. Three P-17 aircraft spat out 36 strong men. They flew down from the high sky, each with a flower, white, red, yellow, and green, ironed on the infinitely good blue sky. You regarded him as a painting, but when you watched him jump down from the plane, your heartstrings would tense up. They all have healthy bodies and minds, steel physiques, and calm hearts. Thinking about jumping down from a height of 1,000 meters in the air, can you not be anxious? The reporter went to visit these heroes who fell from the sky. Everyone was under the wings of the plane, and the green grass was a bench. They were as lively as children. They said, "Jump" I was a little scared the first time, not scared the second time, scared the third time, and more scared after that. Wu Qifa was the first to jump down, solid, calm, and lively, an excellent strong man. Each time from leaving the aircraft to the ground, it took a total of 25 seconds. There were also Wang Baosheng, Zhu Ding, and Ji Danchu, who were the first to jump down. After the performance, everyone gathered at the Lizhi Society for a meal, which lasted until 5:00 PM. Minister Bai will give a lecture in the morning of the 6th.</p>

<h3>Opening of the General Relief Administration Work Review Meeting; Chairman Chiang Issues Admonitory Remarks; Hopes to Overcome Difficulties and Achieve Practical Results</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The first General Relief Administration (GRA) post-war relief work review meeting was held at the Academia Sinica at 9:00 AM on the 5th. Present were GRA Director Chiang Ting-fu, Deputy Director Pu Xuefeng, UNRRA China Office Director Major General Aagerton, directors and deputy directors of various branch offices, heads of various offices, heads of storage and transportation bureaus, representatives of various ministries and commissions, and CCP representative Wu Yunfu, totaling about 200 people. After Director Chiang announced the opening, he respectfully read Chairman Chiang's admonitory remarks, the original text of which stated: "Director Chiang and all colleagues attending the work review meeting: I, Chiang Kai-shek, am deeply concerned that I am unable to attend the meeting in Nanjing due to other commitments. The post-war relief work has been underway in various regions for up to a year in some places and at least half a year in others. Although some regions may have faced special circumstances and various transportation difficulties, hindering the full progress of the work, generally speaking, colleagues from the headquarters to the provincial branch offices have all been dedicated with a fiery spirit, rushing to rescue those affected by the disasters. Achievements such as transporting refugees, providing relief for the Hunan disaster, and preventing floods are undeniable. However, our country has endured eight years of war, and the devastation caused by the enemy is extremely widespread, and the damage to our vitality is particularly severe. Therefore, not only should we intensify our passive relief efforts, ensuring that all relief supplies can quickly reach disaster areas and benefit the victims, alleviating the hardships of this winter, but also, regarding projects related to restoring the people's productive capacity, we should strictly implement them according to the established plans, ensuring that disaster victims in all regions have the means to become self-sufficient in the shortest possible time. It is hoped that the colleagues attending the meeting will use their experience and follow these principles to thoroughly discuss and consider all aspects, overcome difficulties, eliminate obstacles, correct past mistakes, and achieve practical results in the future, to meet the expectations of the people of the whole country. I urge you all to work hard." After the remarks, President Song, represented by Fan Fuchang, and UNRRA China Office Director Aagerton delivered speeches in succession. After the speeches, a group photo was taken, and the opening ceremony was completed. Immediately afterwards, the first general meeting was held, where Director Chiang delivered a speech, providing a detailed account of the GRA's past and future work. The meeting adjourned at around 12:00 PM. At 2:30 PM in the afternoon, the second general meeting was held. First, GRA advisor Wu Jingchao reported on his observations from inspecting Guilin and Hunan provinces. Then, the directors or deputy directors of various branch offices each gave a brief ten-minute report, explaining the progress of their work and the difficulties encountered. The director of the Taiwan branch office, Qian Zongqi, who came from afar, attracted the most attention. The conference will hold review meetings on the 6th, and UNRRA China Office Director Major General Aagerton is scheduled to hold a press conference at 10:00 AM on the 6th.</p>
<h3>Chiang Ting-fu Critically Examines the Advantages and Disadvantages, Pointing Out Optimistic, Dissatisfied, and Tricky Points</h3>
<p>In his speech this morning, Director Chiang expressed dissatisfaction with China's failure to receive fair relief. Chiang stated: UNRRA's total budget is $3 billion USD, and China's share is worth about $600-700 million USD, which is a significant amount. However, considering the population of the recovered areas, the amount received is only $2 USD per person, which is far less than the average of $40 USD per person received by European countries, and even less than the $10 USD or more per person received by former enemy Italy. Chiang stated that he has always felt uncomfortable about this matter. When reviewing past work, Chiang cited several optimistic facts. First, 5 million people in Hunan and Guilin provinces have survived because they received UNRRA supplies. Second, the repair of the dikes of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River is progressing well. If the situation improves, the project to close the breach in the Yellow River is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Third, 700,000 refugees have been sent back to their homes from the rear, and the work of sending overseas Chinese is also underway. Fourth, agricultural improvements in provinces such as Guangxi have been quite effective. However, in carrying out this type of work, various setbacks have been encountered, mainly due to poor organization and insufficient transportation conditions. What Chiang is most dissatisfied with is that some areas have adopted the method of conscripting labor and goods, which has increased the burden on the people. Chiang specifically and solemnly pointed out that from now on, the GRA will no longer support any areas that adopt this type of method. Another thing that Chiang deeply abhors is that a large number of UNRRA supplies are being transferred to contractors, and some people are enriching themselves, so that the workers cannot get the real benefits. He expressed his determination to find a way to eradicate this. He also said, "From now on, those who do not work will not be allowed to obtain food." When talking about future work plans, Chiang said that winter is approaching, so it is necessary to prepare winter clothing in advance, and to list agricultural work as the top priority. Chiang continued to describe the difficulties of the GRA, believing that the most troublesome thing is funding. Although the government budget includes a huge amount of post-war relief funds, the GRA has not received a penny. To date, the GRA relies entirely on borrowing and selling supplies to maintain operations. The second most troublesome thing is transportation difficulties. At present, both water and land transportation are insufficient. Therefore, despite the opposition from the shipping industry, he still advocates using external transportation, because the more transport and distribution there is, the more UNRRA will deliver to us.</p>
<h3>Report from the Shanghai Branch Director on Recent Work</h3>
<p>At the second general meeting held in the afternoon, Wang Renlin, deputy director of the Shanghai Branch, reported on the branch's recent work, stating that the industrial sector in Shanghai has suffered the most severe disasters. Therefore, the branch's work focuses more on "post-war" than on "relief." From October 12 of last year to the end of July of this year, the main task was to carry out emergency relief. Over the past nine months, 970,000 people have received subsidies and relief supplies, and a total of 11,720 tons of flour have been distributed. Among the relief recipients, 72,000 were unemployed workers, which was done under the order of the Executive Yuan and was completed last month. The branch has sent a total of 1,272 refugees, and only a little more than 600 people have not been sent out. They can be sent out by the end of this month. In May of this year, the branch convened a meeting of various charitable organizations and other relevant agencies, hoping that each agency would not rely solely on the GRA's supplies. Since June, the branch's supply of materials has been issued at an 80% discount, and then an 80% discount again in July, in the hope that it can gradually reduce reliance, and that by the end of the year, it will often be able to no longer rely on the branch. The second important work is health relief, including the distribution of medical equipment, the establishment of free hospital beds, and the allocation of cod liver oil and milk powder, etc. As of the end of July, a total of more than 9,000 pounds of cod liver oil and 73,000 cans of condensed milk have been distributed. After entering the office, they also organized epidemic prevention work, which can be completed by the end of this month. Another important work is to dredge rivers and repair the river embankments in Pudong with the Public Works Bureau, with the branch supplying flour, water pumps, and transportation equipment.</p>

<h3>Mayor of Yingkou and Others Commit Malfeasance; Unauthorized Sale of Houses and Forced Donations; Northeast District Investigation Team Has Reported Them</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 4th] The Northeast District Takeover and Investigation Team today released a report exposing the illegal acts of former Yingkou Mayor Fang Yin-zhi, Councilor He Da-qian, and former Police Chief Lou De-pu. The mayor and others entered Yingkou with the National Army on April 2. On the pretext of financial difficulties, they recruited people from all walks of life to form a Financial Reorganization Committee. The committee took over 97 buildings and, under the name of troop support and without permission, sold more than 12 million yuan in circulation vouchers. There were many abuses in the selling prices and methods. They also threatened merchants and forced donations, totaling 7.4 million yuan, which were not included in the city government's accounting and were arbitrarily spent. Enemy and puppet supplies were not listed in a clear inventory, and items such as 629 boxes of cigarettes, 30 large barrels of yu leaves, and furniture were handled without authorization. In addition, before the Communist army captured Yingkou, Police Chief Lou De-pu borrowed 700,000 yuan in circulation vouchers from the city's Chamber of Commerce. He used 200,000 yuan, and the remaining 500,000 yuan were disputed between the mayor and himself, and they refused to return it, forcing the Chamber of Commerce to make up for it themselves, which is clearly fraudulent. In addition to Mayor Fang Yin-zhi, who has been notified to be detained by the authorities in Shenyang, orders have been issued to Yingkou and Anshan to detain Councilor He Da-qian and Lou De-pu (currently working in Anshan) and transfer them to Shenyang for investigation.</p>
<h3>Pro-Communist Elements Employed by UNRRA; Sabotage Relief Plans for China; GRA Representative in the U.S. Accuses the United States</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] The Chinese GRA representative in the United States today accused the United States of employing pro-Communist elements in UNRRA's China Branch to sabotage the agency's relief plans for China, embarrassing the Nanjing government. Other Chinese representatives of the GRA unanimously expressed dissatisfaction with UNRRA's actions in China, saying that the difficulties encountered by the agency were entirely the result of its policies. The repeated changes of branch directors and the vacillation of policy have made it difficult for relief efforts to proceed, and branch officials often quarrel. They hope that the new branch director, Aagerton, will be able to rectify the situation. They also said that although UNRRA Director LaGuardia issued a ban, the Shanghai branch continued to receive supplies from the headquarters as usual when needed. Expanding relief plans for China depends on improving transportation, but UNRRA has not provided any assistance in this regard.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhizhong Returns to Dihua After Inspecting Yining</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 4th] Chairman Zhang Zhizhong and his entourage of 20 people flew back to Dihua from Yining this afternoon. They stayed in Yining for a week. On August 31, they went to the famous Chenzi Gully to observe the terrain. This place is a well-known shady area. The gully is 40 kilometers long, and ten thousand peaks stand tall.

The next day, they inspected the national border line at Huoerguosi, the border between China and the Soviet Union. The Soviet side erected a barbed wire fence, and Soviet guards stood inside the barbed wire fence with guns. They were surprised to see a large number of Chinese personnel arriving. On the afternoon of the 6th, Chairman Zhang hosted a banquet to entertain military and political figures from all walks of life in Yining. During the banquet, he expounded on the new provincial government's policy guidelines, guaranteeing that democratic politics would be absolutely implemented in the future, and asked the entire people of Yining to trust the provincial government and not to act rashly or overstep boundaries.</p>

He said that the preparatory work for the Qiantang River seawall project has been largely completed. The first step is to protect the beaches and repair the collapsed stone seawalls. This work is scheduled to begin in early November and is expected to be completed by the end of June next year. Yesterday morning, he went to Zheshanzhen, 50 miles away from Hangzhou, to survey the stone used for beach protection and seawall repair, but the mountain is too far from the river and transportation is inconvenient, so he plans to turn to the mountains on the north bank of the Qiantang River Bridge for stone. The work of dredging the river and making it follow a certain deep channel is also being planned. The reporter asked about the requests from various counties in eastern Zhejiang to repair the seawalls. He replied that the Xijiang Seawall is also important, and several sluice gates in the Cao'e River are blocked. These are all within the scope of the bureau's work and will be carried out slowly. Tang Zhenxu, deputy chief engineer of the bureau, came to Hangzhou on the 4th and told the reporter that the members of the seawall project inspection team who returned to Shanghai have submitted a report, which is now being organized and will be used as a reference for the bureau.</p>

He sneaked into Wuxi yesterday and was arrested by the county government's political police at the railway station. During the enemy puppet period, Jiang served as a secret agent for the enemy garrison team in Shitangwan, committing all kinds of evils such as rape, robbery, and drug trafficking. His arrest this time has greatly pleased the people.</p>
<p>[Our Wujin Correspondent] Majishan is a mountain island in the center of Taihu Lake in the southeast. The vast expanse of water has always been a haunt for lake bandits.

Upon receiving the report, the county government immediately dispatched the head of the military affairs section, leading a team of security team soldiers, to encircle and arrest them. The robbers had already fled without a trace.

In the early years of the Republic, when the enemy occupied Tianmen, Zhou held a red flag and ordered the villagers to light firecrackers to welcome them. He then organized a maintenance association and served as a public relations officer, offering advice to the enemy commanders Yamada and Nara to attack the National Army and suppress the Tianmen guerrillas, gaining the trust of the enemy and being awarded the title of "Loyal and Pro-Japanese Family."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] As of the 5th, the Capital High Court had received 270 traitor cases. Hu Dachun, Lin Bosheng, Mei Shiping, and Zhou Guoliang have been sentenced to death. The Capital Police Department sent the case of Ma Dengyu to the High Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation on the 5th.</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 5th] Zhang Fulian, the former puppet Jiangsu Provincial Director of Education, was previously sentenced to life imprisonment by the Suzhou High Court in the first instance.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Who Made the Situation in China Serious?</h3>
<p>We initially thought the Five-Man Group could begin negotiations the day before yesterday, and placed hopes on a successful attempt. Who knew that when Zhou Enlai left Shanghai, his saying "attempt" already implied unwillingness to succeed? Therefore, after arriving in Nanjing, the Five-Man Group did not immediately convene, and yesterday there were even rumors of it being shelved and aborted. Although Marshal Ma Siling is still meeting, trying to break the deadlock, and the two government representatives, Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng, still express their desire for success, Zhou Enlai directly said "the situation is serious," indicating that the CCP representatives, besides using the "delay" method of requesting instructions from Yan'an, are still holding on to "preconditions" and avoiding the convening of the Five-Man Group that they had previously agreed to. This is where the "situation is serious" is rooted.</p>
<p>The serious situation in China, in fact, did not start today. Since the beginning of the Japanese surrender last year, when General Zhu De issued a plain-language telegram in Yan'an to seize the surrender, the situation has been serious every day for the past year, and the severity has only deepened day by day. Although in the middle there was CCP leader Mao Zedong's trip to Chongqing, the issuance of repeated cease-fire orders, the holding of the Political Consultative Conference, and the signing of the reorganization and unification plan, all of this seems to have been merely the CCP's process of consolidating and developing the "liberated areas" while implementing its "overall strategy" in accordance with the times. They are nothing more than pavilions used by the CCP to rest its feet on its march to seize the entire regime. Therefore, "fighting" is certainly serious, but "talking" is also serious. According to the previous way of talking, talking is just a short break between two major battles. How could this kind of tea-drinking talk not be serious? This kind of talk fundamentally cannot be considered a "political solution."</p>
<p>The CCP shouts for peace in words but actually believes in fighting; this is the reason for the serious situation in China. Not only that, but the CCP superficially hopes for world peace, but in fact, it strives to make China a hotbed for a third world war. This is the real crux of why the situation in China is becoming increasingly serious. The secret documents of the CCP discovered in various newspapers a few days ago now reveal that they are based on the orders of the World Revolutionary Action Committee. It turns out that what the CCP hopes for and implements is its long-dreamed-of "world revolution" strategy in China. The CCP's important figures are merely dreaming that a third world war might break out, and this future war is precisely the hotbed of world revolution, and the CCP has the task of pre-arranging this hotbed in China. The reason why the situation in China has become increasingly serious over the past year is the result of the CCP's deliberate and dedicated efforts to arrange this hotbed. The CCP created this serious situation, but Zhou Enlai was the first to shout "the situation is serious," as if he was deeply afraid of the severity. This is just like a robber who robs someone and then shouts to the neighbors that they have been robbed, which is a similar trick.</p>
<p>However, we must awaken those who dream of a third world war with a word: Regardless of whether a third world war will happen or not, even if it does happen and is imminent, will another world war be beneficial to China? Of course, we also know that the CCP does not take China's interests into account, but in any case, the CCP loudly sings anti-Americanism and strongly shows pro-Soviet sentiment within China, deliberately trying to create a sense of closeness and distance, even friendship and enmity, between our two major allies, the United States and the Soviet Union, so that the rifts that seem to exist in the overall world situation are first revealed in China, even to the point of sacrificing China as a battlefield for the future world war dreamed of by the CCP. Surely their conscience is somewhat uneasy.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that today's overall situation in China is a matter of China's internal affairs and should not be linked to the international situation at all times and in all places. The more the CCP wants to create a third world war in China, the more we should quickly eliminate this factor that could lead to a major war. And the way to start is to sincerely talk if we can, or resolutely abandon the appeasement policy. If there is no decisiveness, then appeasement will only harbor evil, and the situation will only become more serious!</p>
<h3>Examination of the Colonial Policies of the Great Powers</h3>
<p>The Chinese delegation has proposed to the Paris Peace Conference that the former Italian colony of Libya should be declared independent immediately, or if this is not possible, it should be submitted to a UN agency for trusteeship for several years, after which it should be declared independent. This just call not only shows China's enlightened attitude towards the world's colonies, but also China's consistent sympathy for the lives of people in various colonies under foreign rule, which can be clearly demonstrated here. Therefore, after the Chinese representative put forward such a proposal, it has aroused the attention and importance of countries around the world. In order to make it easier for all countries to understand the motivation of China's proposal, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie specially hosted the press in Paris the day before yesterday evening to clarify the open and honest attitude of the Chinese delegation. He said: "China does not want to demand territorial concessions or reparations at the Paris Peace Conference, but it has to make such a proposal regarding the disposal of Italy's former colonies."</p>
<p>Colonies are the product of the era of capitalist imperialism and are also the source of international disputes, conflicts, and even wars. The First World War can certainly be regarded as a war between Britain and Germany to compete for colonies, and the root cause of the outbreak of the Second World War was also that the problem of the three fascist countries, Germany, Italy, and Japan, demanding colonies could not be resolved. Therefore, far-sighted politicians and diplomats have long foreseen that if international disputes, conflicts, and wars are to be eliminated, the colonial system must be eradicated fundamentally. As former US President Roosevelt said at the Casablanca Conference in 1943: "The colonial system is tantamount to war. It is an inconceivable mistake to think that the US military is shedding blood and fighting in the Pacific for the colonies of Britain, France, and the Netherlands!"</p>
<p>It cannot be said that the success of President Roosevelt's ideals was not crucial to the United Nations' victory in this war. If we want to create peace after the war and lead the world into a new era of peace and democracy, we must follow President Roosevelt's will and continue to work hard to implement it. But in fact, after the war, the great powers, whether in the Council of Foreign Ministers of the five countries in September last year or in the Council of Foreign Ministers of the four countries in May this year, all took their own interests as the starting point when discussing the former Italian colonies, and failed to take President Roosevelt's legacy as the basis for discussing this issue. Therefore, there are no concrete provisions for the disposal of Italy's former colonies in the draft treaty of peace with Italy. The Chinese delegation put forward this amendment to make up for this defect. If it can be passed as desired, all countries in the world will be able to understand the attitude of the great powers towards colonies. Therefore, whether in theory or in practice, the proposal of the Chinese delegation is worthy of close consideration by the representatives of all countries.</p>
<p>Before the war, the great powers competed for "spheres of influence" in various important regions of the world, which was certainly an evil consequence of the colonial system; but after the war, there was also the saying of "security zones," which was loudly chanted, but in fact, it was also the remaining poison of the colonial system. To put it bluntly, it is nothing more than wanting to be "the knife and chopping board, and others the fish and meat," using the beautiful name of "security zone" to actually practice the method of enslaving others. Looking ahead to the future of the world, it is probably still very far from the era of eliminating the colonial system. But in any case, mankind should have a spirit of progress and fight against all dark forces. The Chinese delegation's proposal that Libya should be declared independent immediately, or at least be placed under UN trusteeship until it is fully independent before independence, can be regarded as a major test of the colonial policies of the great powers.</p>

<h3>UN Secretary-General Announces General Assembly Will Convene as Scheduled, Greek Representative Attends Security Council, Vigorously Criticizes Remarks of Ukrainian Representative</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, New York, 4th] The UN General Assembly is ordered to convene on the 23rd of this month as scheduled. The Soviet Union's opposition has been ignored. Secretary-General Lie made this statement today and said that he had not received a formal request for postponement. The General Assembly is scheduled to open at 9 pm (standard time) on the 23rd at Flushing Town Hall in New York State, with opening remarks by President Truman and General Assembly President Spaak (Belgian Foreign Minister).</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 4th, United Press] The UK and the US recently opposed the Soviet proposal to postpone the UN General Assembly to November in Paris or Geneva. This proposal was made by Vyshinsky to the Council of Four Foreign Ministers and was opposed. The meeting remained deadlocked on this issue. According to this inconclusive meeting of the four powers, it was convened on the eve of Byrnes's trip to Germany.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Paris, 5th: Broadcast from Lake Success, USA: At 3:45 pm today, the Security Council held its 61st meeting. The Greek representative attended and made a generous statement, vigorously criticizing the complaint filed by Ukraine. It is said that Greece is an independent and free country, and any foreign interference is not allowed. He went on to say that he could present various facts to prove that Greece not only does not threaten Balkan peace, but is a factor of peace, and that those who endanger peace are others.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, New York, 4th] The UN Security Council met today to discuss the Ukrainian complaint against Greece. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Manuilsky spoke for three hours. In his speech, he criticized the UK as much as he criticized Greece. He said that the UK has established armed forces in Greece, and the facts are there. British troops have supplied Greek farmers with weapons, ordering them to join the British army. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Prime Minister Attlee promised that British troops would withdraw from Greece immediately after the Greek plebiscite. This promise has not been fulfilled. The situation has deteriorated and civil war will eventually break out. Representatives of the Security Council should listen to the statements of the Greek democratic leaders in order to understand the truth of the situation. Since the current Greek government took office in March of this year, it has implemented cleansing actions in the military and political fields, attempting to eliminate democratic elements, and at the same time dissolving trade unions. The suppression actions launched by the Greek government are in fact aimed at domestic ethnic minorities, especially the Slavic people. As for the recent plebiscite, it was the result of British interference in Greek internal affairs. The UK has made every effort to disarm the "Leftist National United Front" in Greece, British military officers have participated in the Greek suppression operations, and the UK controls the Greek economy. All of these violate Article 2, Paragraph 7 of the UN Charter. The Security Council must stop British interference in Greek internal affairs, clarify the situation in the country, and ensure the holding of a free plebiscite. As far as Greece's border disputes with Albania are concerned, Greece's intention to invade is not only aimed at Albania, but also at Yugoslavia. This intention endangers Balkan peace and security. In short, the Security Council should take appropriate steps to ensure the peace sought by the entire United Nations. The Greek representative is scheduled to respond to Mr. Manuilsky's accusations today.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Will Launch Diplomatic Offensive to Maintain Prestige</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 4th] Diplomatic sources predicted today that the Soviet Union will soon launch a massive diplomatic offensive in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to restore its prestige on the sidelines. The Soviet Union's recent setback was the result of the Greek plebiscite, which decided to welcome King George II back to the country. These people believe that other facts that have damaged the Soviet Union's prestige are roughly as follows: (1) The visit of the US fleet to Greece, which the Soviet side considers an example of atomic diplomacy. (2) In the recent negotiations between the United States and South American countries over the aircraft incident, the Soviet Union failed to provide Tito with practical support. (3) Turkey has taken a firm stance against Soviet demands to control the Dardanelles and acquire Turkish territory. (4) Due to the deployment of British troops to Iraq and other reasons, the pro-Soviet policy of Iran's left-wing parties seems to have encountered increasing resistance. (5) The labor movement in Poland has failed to satisfy the UK and the US.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Istanbul, 5th] The governments of the UK and the US have notified Turkey that part of the UK and US fleets intend to visit the Turkish port of Izmir. The Turkish authorities have not yet responded. It is generally believed that the US aircraft carrier "Roosevelt" and other warships currently stationed in the Eastern Mediterranean will be among the ships visiting the Turkish fleet.</p>

<h3>Major Changes Expected in Relations Between US, UK, and Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 4th] According to well-informed sources here: There are now various reasons to believe that major changes are about to occur in the relations between the US, UK, and Soviet Union. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's trip to Moscow proves that UK-Soviet relations have reached a turning point. Regarding this level, it is necessary to review various past facts in order to understand the outline. The relations between the three powers, especially the relations between the UK and the Soviet Union, deteriorated from the beginning of the victory. The United States was in the position of mediator, and the overall situation changed after former British Prime Minister Churchill visited the United States. Since then, President Truman and Secretary of State Byrnes have become increasingly firm in their attitude towards the Soviet Union, while the UK has stood by. This firm attitude of the United States has not been approved by the UK Foreign Office and military, but in the past few weeks, the UK political circles have begun to express considerable anxiety. American newspapers have spoken of the inevitability of a new war, but British public opinion has begun to adopt a more moderate policy towards the Soviet Union. This attitude has been expressed in the recent dispute between the United States and Yugoslavia (the US plane being shot down by South Country). At that time, although the UK agreed with the US ultimatum to South Country, it hoped that the matter would be resolved peacefully. British newspapers reflected this hope, not only the Labor Party newspapers and the left-wing newspapers, but even some local liberal newspapers, after learning of the Soviet Union's views, also advocated renewed efforts. The Labor Party delegation to the Soviet Union returned to London around this time. There is little doubt that the report submitted by the delegation to Prime Minister Attlee was more optimistic. It is said that the report does not involve foreign policy, but Professor Laski (Chairman of the Labor Party Executive Committee, that is, the head of the delegation to the Soviet Union) and his colleagues gave the impression that if the British government could express greater understanding of the internal affairs of Eastern European countries, there would be a possibility of coordination between the communist parties of Central European countries and the British Labor Party. At the same time, Marshal Stalin seemed to regard Professor Laski as Prime Minister Attlee's direct representative. For this reason, when the Soviet Union repeatedly requested to amend the Montreux Convention (the convention that guarantees the neutrality of the Turkish Straits), there was a clear trend in London to seek a basis for some common understanding with the Soviet Union. The issue of the Turkish Straits forced the UK to choose between two paths. One is to recognize the Soviet Union as a potential enemy, strengthen US-Soviet ties, exclude the Soviet Union from the Tatar Strait and the entire Middle East, and maintain the airfields in Turkey. The other path is to seek a basis for understanding with a major country, promote UK-Soviet relations, and resolve the Turkish Straits issue in accordance with the 1915 treaty. One of the above two paths must be chosen. If the UK Cabinet had discussed this issue a week ago, it is almost certain that Stansted, the UK's representative in negotiations with Egypt, would have attended. At this time, Foreign Secretary Bevin received a notice from French Foreign Minister Bidault, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, and US Secretary of State Byrnes to attend an emergency meeting of the four foreign ministers. Therefore, Bevin remained in Paris, Stansted remained in Egypt, and the UK Cabinet meeting was also postponed. In short, there are now various reasons to believe that the Soviet Union has decided to seriously study this issue. Only in this way did Molotov return to Moscow to ask for instructions. The promotion of UK-Soviet relations depends on the results of this trip.</p>
<h3>US and Canada Speeding Up Joint Arctic Defense, Both Sides' Armies Will Continue Extensive Arctic Exercises</h3>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco, 5th: According to reliable sources in Washington, the chiefs of staff of the United States and Canada are speeding up defense work to prevent attacks from the Arctic. The increasing advancement of long-range aircraft makes Arctic defense increasingly important. US and Canadian forces will continue to conduct extensive Arctic exercises. When Marshal Montgomery visits Washington in September, he will roughly discuss joint Arctic defense with General Eisenhower. Starting this Saturday, B-119 bombers will take off from Hawaii, cross the Arctic, and reach Cairo, which further demonstrates the importance of Arctic defense. The US Navy has sent submarines and aircraft carriers to the Arctic waters to explore the ocean conditions. It is said that the range of the new US B-36 bomber reaches 10,000 miles. If these aircraft are based in Alaska, they can attack any location in northern Europe and Asia. At the same time, similar large aircraft can also attack the United States and Canada from northern Europe and Asia via the Arctic.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Germany Celebrate Victory</h3>

<h3>Foreign Minister Wang's Remarks in Paris: Advocates for Libyan Independence; Greater Confidence Needed for Creating Peace and Security</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 4th] Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, hosting reporters here tonight, expressed his belief that the Paris Peace Conference would be successful. He stated, "Although various debates and disputes have arisen at the Paris Peace Conference, I believe it will be successful. I believe we must have greater confidence in creating world peace and security. In particular, creating peace treaties with Germany and Japan is even more important. Unless significant efforts are made immediately after the closure of this conference to create an atmosphere of friendship among the major powers, I do not believe that the major powers will be able to reach an agreement on treaties with these two Axis powers. China, in this conference, is neither seeking territory nor reparations, but has made a suggestion regarding the disposition of Italian colonies. It is a modern historical innovation for representatives of the victorious Allied nations to gather together to determine the legal status of the defeated countries' colonies. The conference must make it clear to the world that the former Italian colonies should be placed under governments acceptable to the local residents. Taking Libya as an example, the Chinese delegation proposed that it should be made independent immediately, and if that is not possible, it should be placed under the trusteeship of a United Nations body. If the countries agree to the latter, the term of the trusteeship should be decided, so as not to repeat the mistakes of the League of Nations mandate system in the past. Therefore, the Chinese representative has made a proposal to the Territorial and Political Commission on Italy, believing that the basic principles of trusteeship stipulated in the United Nations Charter must be implemented in Libya. The conference should ideally inform the residents of the area that the conference has considered their interests and wishes as basic conditions for dealing with the former Italian colonies. This attitude, in the eyes of countries around the world, is sufficient to be seen as the policy adopted by the United Nations on the issue of colonies. Of course, a similar solution cannot be adopted for all former Italian colonies. But we also cannot deny the fact that Libya, compared to other colonies, is a colony that has been developed to a considerable extent. Therefore, the Chinese representative requested the conference to submit the following recommendations to the Council of Foreign Ministers: (1) The Treaty of Peace with Italy must stipulate the immediate independence of Libya. (2) If this recommendation cannot be accepted by all countries, Libya should be submitted to the United Nations for trusteeship for a certain number of years, but the United Nations must guarantee that Libya will declare its independence after the expiration of the trusteeship."</p>
<h3>Three Recommendations on the Trieste Issue</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 4th] When the Italian Political and Economic Committee of the Paris Peace Conference debated the most thorny issue of Trieste today, it received a total of three specific recommendations: (1) Internationalization of western Istria, (2) Establishment of another expert committee to propose a new plan, (3) Amendment of the proposed demarcation method to seek the inclusion of the city of Rijeka into Yugoslavia. As a result, no resolution has yet been formed on these three items. The first item was proposed by South Africa, because most of the residents there are Italians, and Britain and France expressed their support, but Belarus opposed it, believing that Yugoslavia should not be deprived of a suitable outlet to the sea, because the four powers originally suggested that the area belong to the South. The second suggestion was proposed by Brazilian representative Fandula, who believed that the current plan could not satisfy any party, and said that maintaining the status quo for another year would be enough to endanger peace there. The third suggestion was proposed by Belarusian representative Kislov, who said that the city is surrounded by Slavs, and the Italians deliberately gathered in the city. Before the adjournment, Senator Connally, an advisor to Byrnes, had earnestly asked all representatives to keep world peace in mind.</p>
<p>The Military Committee of the Conference today completed its study of the articles restricting the Italian army, navy, and air force, and tentatively passed the clauses preventing Italy from assisting Germany and Japan in rearming.</p>
<h3>Bulgaria's Territorial Expansion Demands</h3>
<p>Greek Representative Refutes Harshly</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 4th] At today's meeting of the Bulgarian Political and Territorial Committee, the Greek representative, Tsaldaris, harshly refuted Bulgaria's demand for West Thrace, pointing out that this was further proof of Bulgarian expansionism. Unexpectedly, on the day after Bulgaria's defeat, it used the opportunity to be allowed to attend the peace conference and state its views, to demand the division of an Allied nation, which is truly an important warning, which we must never forget. If the request is granted, then 250,000 Greeks and 1,000 Turks will have to flee under Bulgarian rule. Article 1 of the Bulgarian peace treaty has already given Bulgaria fertile land. If Greece's legitimate demands are met, Greece is prepared to support this provision. As for Greece's demand to adjust the Greek-Bulgarian border, it is based on the needs of national defense, because Greece has been invaded by Bulgaria three times. Bulgaria's protection of the southern flank of the German army can be said to have made a special contribution to Hitler. When the Bulgarian army occupied Greece, 100,000 people were forced to leave their homes, and 5,048 Jews were expelled, of whom only 122 returned. The narrow strip of land in eastern Greece bordering Bulgaria is the weakest part of Europe. Bulgaria can concentrate its troops within eight days to launch an invasion. The strategically high ground is all within Bulgaria, and the invaders can easily occupy Thessaloniki, cutting off the Greek army's retreat, as was the case when the German army invaded Greece in 1941. The committee then decided to discuss this issue on Friday.</p>

<h3>The United States May Declare the Case Closed If Yugoslavia Agrees to Compensation; Clayton Issues Statement on the Downing of the American Plane</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 4th] Acting Secretary of State Clayton said at a press conference today, "A total of five people died as a result of the Yugoslav attack on the American plane. Yesterday, the United States sent a note to Yugoslavia to conclude the exchange of documents between the United States and Yugoslavia regarding this incident. Regarding this note, Clayton believes that if the issue of Yugoslav compensation can be resolved, this matter can be brought to a close." He pointed out that Marshal Tito had expressed his apologies for the loss of American lives and guaranteed that he would no longer shoot down cross-border planes, even if the planes failed to fly according to signal instructions. When a reporter asked what the situation would be if Marshal Tito refused to pay compensation, Clayton said: "He hopes that this issue will be resolved satisfactorily and that there will be no need for a third party to mediate." Mr. Clayton also said: "The State Department will consult with the American military authorities in the area where the plane took off in order to draw up a list of compensations in the short term." When a reporter asked what the United States' opinion was on the proposed Soviet-Swedish trade agreement, Mr. Clayton said: "The United States has not taken any new action on this proposed agreement. The previous American note mentioned that the motivations of the two countries were purely to strengthen multilateral trade, because the United States originally intended to establish this trade relationship universally around the world."</p>
<h3>American Hydraulic Engineers Demonstrate Superb Skill: Canals Dug in the Rocky Mountains</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 4th] American engineers are now demonstrating superb skill, allowing water to flow even where there is no water in nature. Irrigation canals have been dug in the Rocky Mountains to supply water to hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland. The greatest of these projects is the Adams Tunnel, which passes through the Rocky Mountains near Estes Park in northern Colorado. At thirteen miles long, it is the longest irrigation canal in the world. The tunnel was excavated simultaneously from both sides of the mountain in 1940 and was finally connected in 1944. Next year, water from the western slope of the Rockies can be diverted to the eastern slope. The tunnel is ten feet in diameter and is paved with concrete. There are also two shorter tunnels, one 1.3 miles long and one 1.1 miles long, that branch off from the eastern entrance of the Adams Tunnel to divert part of the water to various power plants.

<h3>Former French Municipal Council: Concealed Real Estate Valued at 200 Billion; Puppet Government Stole and Sold 51 Acres; Decided to Publicly Announce Priceless Recovery</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] Regarding the former French Consulate in Shanghai concealing the publicly-owned real estate of the former French Municipal Council, the reporter learned the following details from relevant parties yesterday: When the French Concession existed, the French Municipal Council owned a total of more than 1,008 acres of real estate, according to the land register published by the council in 1941. However, after the victory, the Shanghai Land Administration Bureau only received more than 634 acres of former French Municipal Council real estate from the puppet government. The difference of more than 300 acres has long been clarified by our land administration authorities. It is estimated that more than 272 acres were concealed by the French side when the puppet government took over the French Concession and were not handed over. More than 51 acres have been sold by the puppet municipal government. Another 56 acres were sold by the French Vichy government. It is reported that although the purchasers of the real estate sold by the puppet government are nominally ordinary citizens, the figures behind the scenes are certain real estate tycoons and traitor Chen Bijun who had dealings with the puppet government at the time. Now, the transfer of property rights disposed of by the puppet government has been stipulated by the Executive Yuan to be invalid, and it is said that the Land Administration Bureau will publicly announce its priceless recovery in the near future. As for the real estate sold by the Vichy government, after the municipal government consulted with the Executive Yuan, it was stipulated that transfers before the establishment of the puppet municipal government in the 31st year were valid, and those after that were invalid. However, in fact, most of this real estate, which is valued at about 30 billion yuan, was sold before the 31st year. The total value of the real estate concealed by the French consulate is estimated to be more than 100 billion yuan, close to 200 billion yuan. Its concealment method is very clever. For example, Fuxing Park and the land behind the park originally had three title deeds, totaling more than 140 acres, but the French consulate initially concealed the title deeds and only transferred a separate title deed for the 136 acres of the Jiang Gongguo part to the puppet side. Some properties were claimed to have been sold by the Municipal Council to the French government. Although the Land Administration Bureau has investigated clearly, it has not been able to deal with it immediately because this matter involves diplomatic relations between the two countries.</p>
<h3>American Court Tries Two War Criminals; Cruel Methods of Abusing Prisoners of War; Forced to Stand at Attention Below Zero; Appendectomy Without Anesthesia</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] Colonel Matsuda, former director of the Changchun Japanese prisoner of war management office, and Captain Kawashima, a medical officer, who abused American prisoners of war, were brought to trial by the American military court yesterday. The two criminals answered "not guilty" to the question of whether they pleaded guilty, just like the criminals in the "Hoke Case" in the past.</p>
<p>Prosecutor William Fowler, a lieutenant, alleged that American prisoners in the Changchun prisoner of war camp were severely abused at the time. One hundred and forty of them suffered from serious diseases, and these diseases were preventable. The camp did not provide air raid shelters for the prisoners, resulting in the deaths of 24 American officers and soldiers in the bombing. Colonel Matsuda behaved violently. Once during an inspection, he ordered American soldiers to stand at attention for a long time in outdoor temperatures below zero. Many prisoners were imprisoned without interrogation if they did not comply. Three prisoners, including Captain Prady, were arrested after attempting to escape and were executed. Matsuda should be held responsible for this crime. Captain Kawashima, as a medical officer, neglected his responsibility. Once, he performed an appendectomy on Captain Corley without anesthesia. When Corley groaned and cried out in pain, he was scolded.</p>
<p>The defendant's defense attorneys, Lei Mang, Captain Fowler, and two Japanese lawyers, requested the court to interrogate the two defendants separately and planned to ask the Japanese government for written proof of its agreement to the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War. All of these requests were rejected.</p>
<p>Witnesses Lieutenant Colonel Harkins and Sergeant Gannett, who is blind, were present in court yesterday. Gannett was accompanied by his wife and was very concerned about the progress of the case.</p>
<h3>Rice Shop Employees Strike; Expected to be Resolved This Morning</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] More than 4,000 employees from more than 730 large and small rice shops in the central area, Pudong, and Puxi of this city went on strike at 10:00 a.m. yesterday due to demands for improved treatment, and continued into the evening. Upon receiving the news, the Social Affairs Bureau immediately summoned both labor and management for mediation and instructed the labor side to resume work first. It is reported that the labor side decided to resume work at 9:00 a.m. this morning. The Rice Grain Industry Employees Association was still holding an emergency meeting on Gu Ba Road late last night. The reason is that the treatment of rice grain industry employees has always been low, with an average monthly income of only more than 40,000 yuan. Therefore, in early August, representatives of the Employees Association made a request to the management for improved treatment. The Social Affairs Bureau mediated and agreed to issue four dou of rice per month. The two sides were originally scheduled to sign the mediation record on the 16th, but at that time the management requested an extension to September 2, and then to the 3rd. However, the management always avoided attending the signing. At that time, the Bean Rice and Miscellaneous Grain Workers Union appeared, and the management used the excuse that the nature of the Association and the Workers Union were the same and did not know which one to sign the record with, and delayed signing. This caused the current labor unrest. It is now known that the management has agreed to sign the mediation record with the Association this morning and implement it immediately.</p>
<h3>Asia Petroleum Labor-Management Dispute; Partial Agreement Reached Yesterday</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] More than 600 employees of Asia Petroleum Company went on strike yesterday due to demands for improved treatment.

<h3>Two New Warships Arrive in Shanghai from Nanjing</h3>
<p>The eight warships, including the Taikang, donated by the United States, sailed to Nanjing last month, and two of them, the "Taiping" and "Yongxing," arrived in Shanghai yesterday. It is reported that they will be dispatched for defense.</p>
<h3>Four Senators from the First District; Publicly Solicit Public Opinion; General Assembly Tentatively Scheduled to be Held in Yiyuan</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] Four senators from the first district of this city, Ma Junshuo, Li Wenjie, Dong Ganwen, and Hong Fumei, invited the heads of the district offices, Bao chiefs, and district representatives from the district to the Jinmen Hotel yesterday afternoon to publicly solicit public opinion so that they could submit it to the General Assembly. About 50 people, including Tu Kaizheng, Ying Shugui, and Jin Runxiang, attended. Ma Junshuo served as chairman. First, Li Wenjie gave a speech, stating that the first district is the center of Shanghai's industry, commerce, and finance, and its responsibilities are undoubtedly heavy. Now that the Municipal Senate is about to be held, citizens should be concerned about municipal facilities. How should we assume responsibility in the future to make Shanghai a model city in the country and meet the needs of national construction? Then, Cheng Jingyuan, the district chief of the first district, stated that the Baojia organization should be strict, the duties should be divided, and the funding should be established. We have this organization, but it is only a nominal one, which instead affects the progress of the work. Other districts claimed that municipal facilities should focus on practicality, be down-to-earth, and only focus on the surface would be useless. Ma Junshuo also reported on two proposals that had been prepared: (1) Strengthen the Baojia organization to facilitate self-government. The methods are to improve the quality of Baojia personnel, increase Baojia funding, expedite the selection of Baojia personnel by the people, hope that the Bao Min Da Hui can be held on schedule, and set up cooperatives and Bao National Schools in each Bao, depending on the local environment. (2) Regarding the pre-trial law, please ask the municipal government to forward it to the Executive Yuan to issue an order to all military and police agencies in the country to implement it earnestly, and to issue separate letters to all military and police agencies in this city to implement it earnestly.</p>
<p>[Another message] The site of the Municipal Senate was originally scheduled to be on Daxi Road, but because the session is very long and the terrain there is very low, it will become a swamp after rain, so it is planned to change the site to Yiyuan, which is currently being negotiated.</p>
<h3>Proposals by Female Senators</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] Female Senator Lu Huimin and others proposed: (1) Establish nursery schools for working women, please ask the municipal government to do so, (2) Plan to ask the municipal government to reward house building and adjust the housing shortage, (3) Universally promote sports to save the country from weakness, (4) Please ask the municipal government to focus on suburban construction and designate new urban areas as cultural areas, (5) Please ask the municipal government to build a large-scale women's relief home.</p>
<h3>Does the Municipal Advisory Council Still Exist?</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] After the establishment of the Municipal Senate in this city, the general public is quite concerned about whether the Shanghai Municipal Government's Municipal Advisory Committee will continue to exist. The reporter made a special trip to visit the relevant authorities for this matter. It is said that the committee is a purely advisory body, not a formal public opinion institution. The committee has a total of 14 members, half Chinese and half Western. The committee only exchanges opinions on municipal issues and cannot make formal resolutions, which does not conflict with the authority and nature of the Municipal Senate.</p>
<h3>If the Municipal Government Approves the Resumption of Horse Racing; Monthly Revenue Can Reach 540 Million; But It Depends on Whether the Senate Can Pass It</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The talk of resuming horse racing at the Jing'an Temple Road Racecourse is rife, and although it still needs to be approved by the Municipal Senate, it seems to have received the tacit consent of the authorities. According to the person in charge of the Racecourse, the Municipal Bureau of Finance had an informal exchange of views with Watson, the Western host of the racecourse. When horse racing is implemented, 40% of all ticket sales will be deducted, of which 20% will go to the municipal treasury and 20% will be used as income for the racecourse. It is estimated that with each business of 300 million yuan and horse racing nine times a month, the municipal government can receive 540 million yuan per month. However, due to the loss of horses (originally 500, now only 150) and the damage to the racecourse, even if the Municipal Senate can pass it, the official horse racing period must be after two months. In addition, the racecourse, in response to requests from all parties, is willing to rent out the middle empty field for sports. Those who want to use it as a tennis or soccer field can contact the racecourse authorities.</p>
<h3>There Are Questionable Aspects to the Materials Received in Dinghai; County Police Once Had an Armed Clash with the Navy; Lists from the Third Theater Area Are Also Incomplete; Wu Wangji Talks About His Trip to Hangzhou</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] Clearing Committee Member Wu Wangji returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou yesterday. The reporter went to ask about the process of this trip and the focus of the Clearing Committee's work in Hangzhou. According to reports, the Clearing Committee went to Hangzhou with two main goals: One, the items received by the Navy Command in Dinghai. This area contains a large amount of military supplies, vehicles, and materials, because the enemy actively managed it before surrendering, intending to use it as a base to resist the Allied forces from landing along the coast. It was also heard that when the Navy Command went to receive it, it had a firefight with the Dinghai County Government Police, which may have been suspicious, so the Clearing Committee must go to Dinghai after going to Hangzhou. The second is for the items received by the Third Theater Area, because the materials in that area were initially received by the Third Theater Area, and then transferred to other agencies. Although the case files and reports received by all parties have been sent, the original good lists are missing and incomplete.</p>
<p>Clearing Committee Director Zhang Zhiben and Clearing Committee Member Zhang Qingzhen are scheduled to go to Hangzhou on the 9th of this month, and Committee Member Wu Wangji will go one or two days earlier to arrange. The investigation time in Hangzhou is one week to ten days.</p>
<p>The Clearing Committee has already set up a receiving office in Hangzhou, but there are very few confidential letters.</p>
<p>The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau's Hangzhou office has four branch offices: Jiaxing, Shaoxing, Ningbo, and Wenzhou. As of now, the materials that have been auctioned off by the four branch offices are less than 2.5 billion in total.</p>
<p>The second group of the Clearing Committee has left Beijing for Suzhou. The third group is responsible for clearing Anqing. It seems that the Xuzhou side has not yet departed.</p>
<p>Committee Member Wu said that after the Second Clearing Committee went to Hangzhou, new cases in Shanghai will stop being accepted on the 9th of this month to the 15th of this month. However, all unfinished cases will continue to be handled. As for enemy and puppet materials that have been concealed and evaded, not much has been found recently.</p>
<h3>Implementing a Cleanliness Zone System; Implementation Measures Defined</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau is developing citizens' ability to self-govern to promote indoor and outdoor cleanliness, and has specially formulated the Shanghai Municipal Temporary Implementation Measures for Promoting the Cleanliness Zone System. The measures were approved by the 38th Municipal Meeting of the Municipal Government and are scheduled to be announced and implemented in early September. The measures are as follows: (1) Take Bao as the center. Each Bao will convene a temporary Bao Min Da Hui to formulate cleanliness regulations. The Bao Jia chiefs will urge each household to comply with the regulations. Those who violate the regulations will be punished by the Bao. Bao chiefs who are not effective in their work may be punished by the district office, and repeat offenders may be reported to the police station for punishment. (2) Taking the district office as the center, the district chief will convene a meeting of Bao Jia chiefs to discuss and implement measures to strive for cleanliness of streets and alleys and to clear the garbage accumulated in the past. There are also cleanliness competition measures. The district health committee will send representatives to inspect each Bao Li Long, record scores for each item, and reward and punish accordingly.</p>
<h3>Rong Desheng Unconcerned? $240,000 USD Repeatedly Urged to Collect, Preparing to Donate All</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The confiscated stolen money, the Garrison Headquarters had previously notified Rong to come to the Military Law Office of the Headquarters at 3:00 PM yesterday to collect it. However, the "Cotton Yarn and Flour King" seemed not very interested in recovering his lost money. By the time the office closed at 6:00 PM, Rong had neither come in person nor sent someone to collect it on his behalf. Zhu, the section chief of the Military Law Office in charge of the case, made four phone calls to "urge his arrival." The first call was at 4:55 PM, made to Rong's residence. The person who answered the phone claimed to be a houseboy, saying that all the members of Rong's family were at the "15774" Hengfeng Yarn Factory. Section Chief Zhu then transferred the call to that number to inquire, and the person who answered the phone was an old quartermaster, who said that Rong and others had just left the factory to return home. At 5:10 PM, another call was made to Rong's residence, but it was said that they had not yet returned. The last phone call was made at 5:25 PM, and a member of the Rong family finally answered, saying that someone had been sent to the Garrison Headquarters in the morning, but it was to the Investigation Department for some contact, and that the money was planned to be collected tomorrow. At that time, a secretary in the office was nearby and took the call, firmly urging them to come and collect it that day, but until the closing bell "ding-donged," the piles of American dollars, legal tender, and gold piled on the desk of the head of the Military Law Office had not yet seen their "rightful owner." Because there was no safe in the Military Law Office, they had to send personnel to guard the room at night, and everyone felt deeply dissatisfied with Mr. Rong's "unconcern."</p>
<p>The total amount of the returned stolen money was previously reported to be more than 240,000 US dollars. In fact, only a part of it was US dollars, and the rest was the equivalent of gold and legal tender. The exact figures are still to be announced today. Yesterday, the police station sent Feng Qishan, the chief of the Criminal Investigation Section, along with staff members Zhang Changgui and others, to bring the part confiscated by the police station to the Garrison Headquarters for handover to the Military Law Office, including US$67,400, 4.6 million legal tender, one gold ring with three diamonds, one pure gold bracelet, one gold anklet, one ladies' western gold 18K watch, six pure gold rings, one pair of gold earrings, one ELBA watch, one western gold pin, and one western gold ring.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Rong family stated that after retrieving the stolen money, they would donate all of it to the welfare fund of military and police agencies and for the relief of refugees.</p>
<h3>Railway Staff Member Embezzles Goods, Investigation Has Yielded Clues, Feng Zhenbang and a Mr. Lei Flee with Goods, Jinpu Railway Bureau Offers a Reward of 500,000 Yuan for Their Arrest</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The joint passenger and freight transport between the Beijing-Shanghai and Jinpu Railways recently experienced an embezzlement incident by a freight escort. Given the well-established reputation of the railway, this kind of incident is a first, so the railway authorities are paying great attention to it. A reward of 500,000 yuan has been offered for the strict arrest of Feng Zhenbang, the freight escort of the Jinpu Railway who is on the run. It is reported that at the beginning of last month, Chen Baichuan, a cloth merchant in this city, entrusted the railway bureau to jointly transport eighteen pieces of cotton cloth to Xuzhou, intending to transfer them to the Longhai Railway to transport them to Shaanxi. After the goods arrived in Xuzhou, they could not proceed due to the interruption of the Longhai Railway. Therefore, on the 22nd of the same month, he handed over the cotton cloth to the Xuzhou station for joint transportation back to Shanghai, which was transported southward by train No. 51, with Feng Lingbang of the Jinpu Railway Vehicle Section as the freight escort. After the train arrived in Shanghai on the 24th, the luggage room of the Shanghai North Station found that twelve pieces of cotton cloth were missing during the inventory. At that time, the freight escort Feng Zhenbang immediately said that the remaining twelve pieces could be loaded on the next train and issued a receipt stating "Twelve pieces of cotton cloth to be transported." Partial loading and transportation was a common occurrence, so the North Station luggage room did not suspect anything. , , The North Tong Station chief telegraphed the Xuzhou station to inquire and discovered that Feng Zhenbang had embezzled the goods. The two railway bureaus have now sent investigators Xiang Peiyu, and the Jinpu Railway sent investigators Sun Shuren and Li Guanghui, to conduct investigations in Beijing, Shanghai, and Xuzhou. It was learned yesterday that the case has already yielded clues, and that the goods were taken away from the Nanjing station by Feng in collusion with a Mr. Lei, an employee of the Xuzhou luggage room, who impersonated the owner and forged a "self-managed parcel ticket." Feng and Lei are now both on the run. However, the Jinpu Railway has always adopted a three-person joint guarantee system for employing employees, so the two employees who guaranteed Feng have been detained. . As for the twelve pieces of cotton cloth, they include one piece of Yuexin lady's fabric (26 pǐ), five pieces of American wool (26 pǐ each), two pieces of Guoguang wool (22 pǐ each), six pǐ of Guoguang wool, six pǐ of Meihua wool, ten pǐ of Jeep wool (combined into one piece), one piece of Jeep wool (20 pǐ), one piece of Yuanzhi tribute fabric (10 pǐ), and one piece of plaid fabric (30 pǐ). The above totals twelve pieces of cotton cloth (282 pǐ). It is said that the Jinpu Railway authorities will be responsible for compensating for the above losses first.</p>
<h3>American Bureau for Medical Aid to China, Future Main Goal: Training Medical Personnel</h3>
<p>Fifty People Currently Being Trained, Ms. Stevens Discusses Mission of This Trip</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Ms. Stevens, Director-General of the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China, arrived in Shanghai from the United States a week ago. Yesterday afternoon, she received reporters at the office of the bureau on Jiangxi Road. Ms. Stevens said: She did not prepare too many plans for this trip to China, but wanted to have more contact with leaders from all sectors of the Chinese medical community and the Chinese people to find out what difficulties China urgently needs and needs to be solved, and then discuss solutions together. Ms. Soong Mei-ling is the honorary chairman of the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China.

Ms. Stevens also said that half of the staff at the New York headquarters of the bureau are Chinese, and this organization can also be said to be a Sino-US cooperative institution. At present, the supply of goods is not much, and its main purpose is to train Chinese medical talents. There are currently fifty Chinese people being trained in the United States, including experts, nurses, and researchers in various academic fields.</p>
<p>Ms. Stevens paid great attention to public health, saying: Wilkie once said in "One World": "Health is more important than everything." Ms. Stevens also told that she only flew 54 hours from the United States to China, which shows how easy it is for germs to spread. Ms. Stevens praised the cholera eradication campaign in this city, saying that this disease is extremely terrifying, and it is not easy to control it.</p>
<p>Ms. Stevens is scheduled to fly to Beiping today to inspect the penicillin production plant being prepared by the Anti-epidemic Committee of the Executive Yuan's Department of Health, which is scheduled to be established on Double Ten Day.

<h3>Scope of Business License Tax in This City to Be Revised</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The issue of business license tax for various businesses in this city was recently discussed by Yan E'sheng, Secretary-General of the City Chamber of Commerce, and Gu Chunfan, Director of the Finance Bureau. The tax rate for each industry that should pay license tax is collected at a rate of five per thousand of the capital. If the capital is difficult to estimate or difficult to investigate, it was resolved by the municipal government meeting that it could be calculated and collected in accordance with the previous license fee rate. However, although the scope of collection has been approved and added by the Ministry of Finance, various industries have not yet obtained licenses and paid taxes. Recently, it has been heard that the central government will re-revise the previously promulgated tax law in the near future. At that time, the scope of business license collection in this city will naturally be revised accordingly.</p>

<h3>Wen Lanting Weakened by Illness During Trial, Answers Questions with Only a Few Words, Nods Frequently, Claims to Have Acted on Orders When Assuming Puppet Positions, One Cry of "Grandpa" Brings Forth Tears, Seated and Served Tea in Court, Closing Arguments Concluded, Sentencing on the 12th</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The High Court held a collegiate panel hearing on the case of Wen Lanting, suspected of being a traitor, at 9:45 AM yesterday. The defendant was helped out of prison by a bailiff and answered questions in court (see photo taken by this newspaper), but only said a few words and did not say much more. Three lawyers, Jiang Yong, Zhu Fujiu, and Sha Yankai, defended him. The hearing ended at 11:10 AM, and the court ordered that the sentence be pronounced at 9:30 AM on the 12th of this month.</p>
<p>The defendant wore a blue silk long gown, with a white short shirt and trousers underneath, light brown gauze socks on his feet, white-soled black shoes, frameless glasses on his nose, and held a folding fan in his hand. His hair was gray and his beard was long to his chest. Due to old age and weakness, poor spirits, and illness, he was helped by two bailiffs and walked out of the Zhongzi Prison at 9:25 AM, followed by two forensic doctors. He first went to the waiting room to rest for a while. His grandson stepped forward to shake hands and greet him, and when he asked "Grandpa," and "How is your health?" The defendant was touched by the scene and felt full of sorrow, unable to answer. After a long time, he choked out the words "Good, good," and then waved his hand to signal him to leave. After his grandson wiped away his tears and sadly left the room, he took off his glasses, took out a handkerchief from his pocket, and wiped away his tears. His thin and wrinkled hands trembled constantly.</p>
<p>At 9:45 AM, Presiding Judge Liu Yugui, along with two judges Cao Jun and Qiu Huan, prosecutor Ye Yushao, and court clerk, arrived in court and took their seats. They immediately ordered the bailiffs to bring the defendant to court. He was still helped up by two people, with the forensic doctor attending on the side to prevent accidents. Presiding Judge Liu first asked the forensic doctor about the defendant's condition, and the answer was that he suffered from scrotal edema, athlete's foot, and heart disease. Presiding Judge Liu then ordered the bailiffs to place a chair next to the defendant's bar, and then poured a cup of tea, and after letting the defendant sit down, he began to inquire. First, he asked Wen Lanting, 77 years old, from Wujin, residing on West Aihams Road, and formerly a director of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, is that correct? The defendant nodded after each question and did not say much more. Presiding Judge Liu then asked prosecutor Ye Yushao to stand up and state the main points of the indictment, briefly stating: The defendant joined a puppet organization in 1942 and served as the chairman of the Supervisory Committee of the Puppet Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. In 1943, when the Puppet Business Control Association was established, he controlled and collected various materials on behalf of the enemy. The defendant served as the chairman of the Supervisory Committee of the association. In July 1944, he succeeded Tang Shoumin as the chairman of the board of directors, and also served as the chairman of the Puppet Cotton Control Association, buying cotton yarn on behalf of the enemy, and also served as the chairman of the Puppet Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association, soliciting air defense donations for the enemy and puppets to use. Therefore, a public prosecution was filed in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Answering Questions with Nods One by One</p>
<p>Presiding Judge Liu immediately asked about the various puppet positions that the defendant had held over the years, according to the prosecutor's allegations. The defendant either answered with a nod, or said "Yes," or just answered with a "Yes." The court then asked: What do you have to say about holding these puppet positions? The defendant immediately stood up and said that he had three statements: (1) I do not admit to conspiring with the enemy to plot against this country, and I do not admit to being a traitor. (2) The puppet position affairs that I have held were ordered by the central government beforehand, and I always followed the will of the central government afterwards. (3) All the confessions and self-confessions I made to the Military Statistics Bureau of the Fulv Lili Road were due to environmental coercion, and should therefore be invalid. What I want to say now is all in the defense statement, please judge publicly. After he finished speaking, he sat down.</p>
<p>Heart Beating, Sick, Still Doesn't Speak</p>
<p>The court then asked: Is the defense the same as the statement? Answer: The same. Question: You do not admit the transcripts of the Military Statistics Bureau, now you may as well briefly tell the truth. Answer: Please forgive the court, I still won't speak, because my heart is beating badly, I am sick. At this point, defense lawyer Zhu Fushun stood up and said: The defendant had military intelligence contacts with Li Mingyang, the former acting chairman of Jiangsu Province, which was proven by Wu Shiyi of the Third War Zone when he came to court last time. Later, Wang Maogong succeeded Li Mingyang as the head of Jiangsu and continued to hire the defendant as an advisor, which was before the victory, and there is a letter of appointment to prove it. The court immediately showed the letter of appointment to the defendant and asked: Is it correct? Answer: Correct. Question: Huang Hanzhi testified in court last time that you had done many charitable undertakings, such as refugee shelters and wounded soldiers' hospitals, are they all correct? Answer: This is a matter of duty, yes. Question: Qi Zaiyu, who was engaged in underground work as a special agent in Shanghai during the occupation, and others testified in court last time that you had rescued them: Answer: Not just once.</p>
<p>Holding Puppet Positions Said to Have a Tacit Understanding</p>
<p>Question: The Central Statistics Bureau has an official letter to Attorney Jiang, proving that you have provided cover for underground workers, and also said that you contacted the Central Statistics Bureau in advance before taking up puppet positions, is there such a thing? Answer: Yes. I didn't dare to say it before, but now that they have come out and said it, I won't deny it, it's true. At this point, Attorney Zhu stood up again to supplement: It was not to establish contact, but to file a record in advance before taking up puppet positions. The court asked the defendant: Lao Jingshou, Xu Jiqiang, Yan Huiqing, and others have submitted statements to this court stating that you provided cover for work and passively did not cooperate with the enemy and puppets when you were in puppet positions, what about this? Answer: I don't know inside (referring to prison). Question: The court obtained the minutes of the Standing Committee meeting of the Puppet Business Control Association, which totaled 27 meetings from August 1944 to August 1945. There are records of purchase and distribution plans, all with your signature. Take a look, is it? After the defendant looked at it, he replied: Yes.</p>
<p>Doesn't Admit But Also Doesn't Deny</p>
<p>The court then asked: This court also has the Puppet New China Daily and the Puppet Shen Bao. When you were the chairman of the Puppet Business Control Association, you made speeches at the "Greater East Asia War Anniversary" and the "National Government's Return to the Capital Anniversary" meetings. What do you have to say about this? Answer: I cannot admit or deny this. If the newspaper wants to publish it, I can't tell them not to publish it. But it is a fact that I don't talk much usually. Then, Attorney Zhu presented a certificate from Xu Caicheng to the court, stating: The defendant took office as the chairman of the Puppet Business Control Association on July 1, 1944, but in May and June, he was ordered by the Central Statistics Bureau to step up the prevention of control, and Xu Caicheng directly telegraphed the chairman on June 22.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Ye Stood Up to Accuse</p>
<p>At this point, Presiding Judge Liu said that the case was very clear and began the arguments, first asking the prosecutor to accuse. Prosecutor Ye immediately stood up and stated: The Puppet National Commercial Control Association was the highest institution for the enemy to control materials in our country. The defendant successively served as the chairman of the Supervisory Committee and the chairman of the board of directors of the association, and also served as the chairman of the Puppet Cotton Yarn Control Association, collecting materials on behalf of the enemy. According to the investigation, the puppet Executive Yuan once ordered the Puppet Business Control Association to purchase 2 million dan of military rice and more than 50,000 pieces of cotton yarn successively. The defendant also served as the chairman of the Puppet Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association, raising 100,000,000 puppet currency for air defense donations, and repeatedly made pro-enemy remarks. He is undoubtedly willing to be an accomplice and should be punished by the court with the punishment he deserves.</p>
<p>Defense Lawyers Responded Separately</p>
<p>The court then asked the defendant's defense lawyers to respond. Lawyers Jiang Yong, Zhu Fushun, and Sha Yankai responded one by one on the three points of legal facts and right and wrong. They said in brief: The Shanghai people all know the defendant in this case. He has been upright and very selfless throughout his life. For decades, he has assisted the revolution and served the society. It can be said that he has completely worked for the public and not for himself. Because of his uprightness, the defendant is unwilling to speak out about the beneficial things he has done for others. The people who came to court last time to provide favorable evidence for the defendant all came voluntarily and were not based on the defendant's own claims or requests. The defendant took up a puppet position under the order of the central government, and is now not understood by the outside world and has been deeply stimulated. Therefore, although there is various favorable evidence, the defendant is unwilling to say more. He didn't say anything when he was questioned by the Military Statistics Bureau last year. The transcripts of the bureau are full of contradictions, and the self-confession was written by someone else. All the confessions, self-confessions, and transcripts of the defendant in the Military Statistics Bureau are completely not his own meaning, so they cannot be admitted. Qi Zai Wang and Wu Shiyi of the Third War Zone of the Military Statistics Bureau have testified in court last time that they had been rescued by the defendant. In fact, there are too many underground workers who have been rescued by the defendant, there are one or two hundred on the surface, and thousands indirectly. Zhang Shutong, the father of martyr Zhang Xiaotong, was also protected by the defendant, and the defendant himself was interrogated by the enemy gendarmerie because of this, and was forced to confess Zhang's address, but he never said it. If it is said that the defendant conspired with the enemy, then why didn't he tell the enemy gendarmerie at that time? The defendant handled affairs in Shanghai under the order of the central government, and any group puppet position he participated in was filed in advance. When Li Mingyang was the acting chairman of Jiangsu Province, the radio station of his Shanghai office was located in the defendant's home. Therefore, Wang Maogong continued to hire the defendant as an advisor when he became the head of Jiangsu. On July 1, 1944, the defendant took office as the chairman of the Puppet Business Control Association and was ordered in advance to find ways to prevent commercial control. The purchase of yarn and cloth was in 1943, when the defendant was still the chairman of the Supervisory Committee and was not responsible for the actual responsibility, and this matter was not purchased by the Puppet Cotton Control Association, but was responsible by the yarn and cloth purchase office under the Puppet Business Control Association. As for the statement that 2 million dan of rice were supplied to the enemy, this was a matter of the Puppet Rice Control Association, and these 1 million or 2 million dan were all empty words and there was no evidence. As for air defense donations, because most of the dead in air raids were Chinese, they were used to relieve the victims, and were not used to make anti-aircraft guns or planes to fight against the allied aircraft. Participating in various "commemorative meetings" and making speeches may have been inaccurate records, and the defendant had the capital to provide cover. If he did not participate, he would not be able to provide cover. In February 1945, Xie Chengxun, the administrative commissioner and security commander of the third district of Jiangsu, came to Shanghai to contact Ren Yuandao, Zhou Fohai, and others to defect, and the defendant also participated in it. Now that Ren Yuandao, who listened to it afterwards, is a dignified government official, while Wen Lanting, who is responsible for the counter-insurgency, has to bear the crime. This matter is still requested to be studied by the court. In short, the defendant does whatever is beneficial to the people, and absolutely does not do anything that is not beneficial to the people. Whether speaking from a behavioral or legal point of view, the defendant did not use the power of the enemy and puppets to act in a way that was detrimental to this country, but used the power of the enemy and puppets to act in a way that was beneficial to this country. Therefore, he cannot be called conspiring with the enemy to plot against this country, but should be called conspiring with this country to plot against the enemy. The defendant is a traitor to the enemy country, a traitor to the puppet government, not a traitor to this country. Now it is not a question of fact, not a question of law, but a question of right and wrong. Please the court distinguish between right and wrong and give the defendant a verdict of not guilty.</p>
<p>Nodding, Waving, Sad Farewell</p>
<p>After the arguments ended, the court asked the defendant again: Do you have anything else to say? He replied: I have nothing to say, please the court judge publicly. Presiding Judge Liu immediately announced that the verdict in this case was scheduled to be announced at 9:30 AM on the 12th of this month, and then adjourned the court. It was 11:10 AM. The defendant stood up, nodded and waved goodbye to his family and friends sadly, and was still helped back to the Zhongzi Prison by the bailiffs.</p>
<h3>Chen Jicheng and Mao Tiemei Case, Witnesses Summoned, Retrial Rescheduled, Wang Zhenchuan and Others Indicted</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of Chen Jicheng, the puppet ambassador to Manchuria, Mao Tiemei, the intelligence officer of the puppet Nanjing Political Security Bureau, and others was investigated yesterday, and the summoned witnesses were rescheduled for retrial.</p>
<p>Wang Zhenchuan, Guo Renjie, Xu Fuxiang, Du Lixiang, Li Renfu, Zhu Jinxu, Zhang Jiaxiang, and others were indicted by the High Prosecutor's Office on suspicion of treason. In addition, Zhu Heming, Liu Xianglin, Wang Pinfa, and others were not prosecuted due to insufficient evidence.</p>
<h3>Living Expenses for Families of Traitors, High Court Has Decided on Implementation Measures</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After the victory, the courts in various places ruled that all the property of traitors would be confiscated except for the necessary living expenses for their families. How the two words "necessary" should be interpreted has not been clearly stipulated by the authorities. For this reason, the courts in Anhui and other places have requested an explanation from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, but no response has been heard so far. It is learned that the Shanghai High Court has determined a method for this, that is, after the confiscated property of the traitor is auctioned, a part of it will be allocated to the family according to the general ordinary living conditions in the society. This matter is now being implemented by the High Prosecutor's Office.</p>
<h3>Too Many Maritime Agencies, Many Maritime Security Problems</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, the "scalpers" on the Huangpu River have been extremely active, causing great suffering to travelers. The biggest problem with the poor security situation on the river is actually due to the fact that there are too many parallel agencies and their powers have not been unified. It is reported that there are as many as six agencies responsible for maintaining security in the 40-li stretch of water in the city, namely (1) the Maritime Police Sub-bureau, (2) the Port Police, (3) the Maritime Inspection Office of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, (4) the Military Police Regiment, (5) the "Executive Yuan" Security Group, and (6) the petition police used by the "Executive Yuan." Mayor Wu recently convened relevant parties to discuss improvement measures, but no concrete results were obtained. A senior official of the police bureau told reporters yesterday that to improve maritime security, it would be best to merge these six units, which would unify their powers and save expenses. At present, there are only more than 130 on-duty personnel in the Maritime Police Sub-bureau, divided into three shifts, so at most 30 police officers are dispatched at ordinary times, which is naturally not enough. If a new and expanded organization can be established and criminal and foreign affairs police are added to be responsible for investigating bandits and opium and inspecting passengers' passports, it is believed that the maritime security situation can be greatly improved.</p>
<h3>Shipping Industry Prepares to Organize Dock Warehouse Company</h3>

The planned capital is 5 billion yuan.</p>

<h3>Charity Sale of National Goods: Nitric Acid Accidentally Splashes on Two Young Girls</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The charity sale of national goods for educational purposes, held at the Sino-French School, was on its last day yesterday. Shanghai Girls' High School student Ying Suqiu (17 years old), accompanied by her neighbor Ma Suqin (13 years old), went to the school to shop at 4 PM. They were standing at the stationery charity sale booth when Shen Jiadong, an employee of the Shanghai Machine Factory, bought a bottle of "nitric acid" and stood behind the two girls to watch the excitement. Accidentally, drops of acid leaked from the bottle and splashed on the legs of Ying and Ma. They immediately cried out in pain and fell to the ground. After the incident, the police officers stationed there sent the two girls to Nanyang Hospital for treatment and detained the perpetrator for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Regarding our newspaper's news item published on August 28th, "Major Drug Trafficking Case Cracked," we received a letter from the Dacha Air Force Station stating: "No aircraft carrying drugs has landed at the Dacha Airport. We hereby request that you investigate and make corrections." While the drug trafficking case is indeed a fact, and the suspects have long been transferred by the Songhu Garrison Command to the District Prosecutor's Office for handling, the claim of "air transport of drugs" and "landing at Dacha Airport" has been found to be incorrect after further inquiry by our newspaper with relevant parties. The case was indeed cracked by the Water Patrol Division of the Inspection Office of the Songhu Garrison Command, but it was not air transport, nor did it land at Dacha Airport. We hereby request that you make the necessary corrections. Sincerely, Continental News Agency.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Journalists Association Warmly Welcomes Professor Pei Fei</h3>

Over thirty people attended, including Feng Youzhen, Pan Gongzhan, Chen Xunian, Zhan Wenhu, Wang Yunsheng, Li 　　, and reporters from various newspapers.</p>
<p>Feng Youzhen Delivers Welcoming Speech</p>
<p>Feng Youzhen, the standing director of the Journalists Association, rose to deliver a welcoming speech, stating that the missions of educators and journalists are the same. Professor Pei Fei has studied international issues for decades and has a deep understanding of the global situation. Since the end of the war, China has been turbulent and unable to achieve peace and unity. However, we sincerely believe that the stability of China is the stability of the Far East, and only when the Far East is stable can world stability be ensured. In this turbulent world and unstable political situation, the work of journalists is extremely arduous and difficult. Professor Pei has profound research on various issues, so we ask Professor Pei for guidance. Professor Pei modestly replied that he agreed with what was said, but he did not have much to offer. He acknowledged that journalism is an arduous task, especially in a turbulent world and a troubled China. He expressed his respect and sympathy for journalists, believing that journalism and striving for peace are equally difficult tasks. Freedom of the press is the freedom of the nation, so we should always fight for freedom of the press. Over the decades, Chinese journalism has been constantly progressing, and he wished the press continuous struggle for justice. Professor Pei's brief but heartfelt words were met with applause.</p>
<p>Li Ximou Announces Lecture Topics</p>
<p>Li Ximou, deputy director of the Municipal Education Bureau, reported that Professor Pei Fei is an expert on international affairs and is visiting China as a formal representative of the United States, invited to inspect various universities and cultural institutions.

Professor Pei has scheduled four public lectures on the 10th, 11th, 17th, and 18th of this month, at 4:30 PM at the YMCA.

<h3>Gauze Smuggling Issue, Export Management Not Ordered, South China's Yarn Allocation Reaches 80%, 4,000 Pieces of Allocated Yarn Unshipped</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, this reporter visited Wu Weijing, deputy general manager of China Textile Construction Company, to inquire about the actual situation of gauze smuggling from South China. According to him, although gauze smuggling is often heard of, it is impossible to state the actual situation due to the inability to accurately quantify it. However, recently the gauze market in various parts of Vietnam has been heated, with 20-count yarn reaching 3 million legal currency per piece, and ordinary bleached cloth reaching over 120,000 legal currency per bolt. Where there is profit, smuggling is inevitable. Moreover, the applications for yarn allocation from various yarn factories to the joint distribution agencies for export to South China account for 80% of the total. It seems that the demand for yarn in South China's processing industry is not so large. The surplus is inevitably flowing to various parts of Southeast Asia through Hong Kong, Macau, and other places. The Textile Business Management Committee has drafted management measures for this matter, but has not yet received instructions from the Executive Yuan. According to Mr. Wu's opinion, the management of gauze exports should be somewhat flexible. The feasibility of exporting should be determined based on the actual domestic supply and demand for gauze. For example, if yarn is a raw material and domestic demand is urgent, there is no need to consider exporting it at present. However, among the finished fabrics, colored fabrics are the most popular in Southeast Asia. If there is a surplus in this city, it may be worth considering exporting some to maintain the domestic printing and dyeing industry and the livelihoods of its employees. As for the supply of cotton yarn in this city, there is actually more than enough. As far as Textile Construction is concerned, there are currently more than 4,000 pieces of allocated cotton yarn that have not yet been claimed by customers. Among them, there are more than 800 pieces of fine yarn. It can be seen that the need for cotton yarn in this city is not as urgent as commonly believed.</p>
<h3>Market Trading is Sluggish, Black Market Prices for "Double Horse" Drop Again</h3>
<p>The market price of gauze is slightly higher than yesterday. Fine "Dragon Head" cloth was traded at 64,500 yuan, "Wah Gee" at 60,000 yuan, and other goods were traded very little. Textile Construction's opening price remained the same, and fewer factories came to purchase than in the previous session. In the yarn market, "Double Horse" opened at 1.5 million, then fell to 1.412 million, and miscellaneous brands also retreated to around 1.3 million. Except for the popular 42-count "Blue Phoenix," which remained at 2.14 million, other 42-count "Shi Guang" only traded at 2.08 million, and there were few transactions. As for 32-count "Xiantao" cones, there were no inquiries. The reason for the weakness is that the festival season is approaching and credit is tightening. In addition, the Cantonese gang, which usually absorbs a large amount, has also been restricted, which has a significant impact on the market. According to people in the industry, the Cantonese gang has recently remitted a large amount of funds again, and many companies have applied to the Customs Administration for export. In the future, some gauze may be approved for shipment to the south, but the expected time will be after the festival.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the Textile Construction Company has stopped accepting registration cards for application registrations from various factories. At the same time, it is also carefully reviewing and reorganizing those who have already been registered and approved to receive goods. The qualification for opening goods for vendors and out-of-town customers is also being re-evaluated, while manufacturers are investigated for their production capacity in order to determine the standard for opening goods, so that those who open goods can get what they need and market prices can be stabilized, it was said.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Cotton Cloth Shipped to Guangdong</h3>
<p>Reportedly Due To Customs Announcement of Prior Registration [Reported by This Newspaper] China Merchants' "Peide" ship sailed to Guangdong today, carrying 6,500 pieces of cotton cloth. "Jiang Qing" ship sailed to Chongqing this morning, loaded with more than 610 pieces of cotton for shipment to Chongqing. According to shipping industry news yesterday, Customs issued a notice yesterday prohibiting the shipment of cotton yarn and cotton cloth to South China, including the seven ports of Guangdong, Shantou, Xiamen, and Fuzhou. According to South China merchants, the Customs announcement yesterday prohibiting the export of cotton yarn and cotton cloth to South China does not hinder merchants. The purpose of the ban is to stop smuggling. Since the Customs' No. 25 announcement on January 19 of this year, prohibiting the export of cotton yarn and cotton cloth to foreign countries, smuggling out of Guangzhou has gradually increased, resulting in a continuous large amount of cotton yarn and cotton cloth being shipped from this city to the south, and prices have gradually increased accordingly. It is also understood that smuggling is speculative and is done by people with evil forces. Legitimate merchants can still apply to the customs at the destination, and if they obtain a certificate, they can still purchase and transport goods, but the procedures are slightly more troublesome. As for the cotton cloth shipped to Guangdong by the "Peide" ship today, it was registered before the Customs announcement, so it can be shipped out.</p>
<h3>Gold and Paper Money Change from Stable to Weak</h3>
<p>"Xia Chi" reported to downstream yesterday that it opened in the morning at around 2.05 million. The high price was once called 2.06 million. The pressure from the Central Bank increased again, and the upward trend stopped. It gradually declined. The 2 million level was soon broken. It fell to a low price of 1.78 million in the middle of the day, and then short covering maintained it. It struggled at around 1.85 million at closing, resulting in a drop of 570,000 compared to the previous closing. A and B fell by 250,000, Type D fell by 350,000, and Type E also fell by 300,000. The Securities Exchange temporarily did not auction unified bonds, and people's hearts were unsettled.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies changed from stable to weak. The US dollar gradually declined from a selling price of 3,300 yuan. The gold market was heavily weak. It fell to around 3,240 yuan near noon before slightly rebounding. In the afternoon, it followed the gold market and rebounded, finally closing near the 3,300 yuan level, resulting in a similar closing to the previous day. Hong Kong dollars changed from flat to weak, and the low price once fell to around 670 yuan, and then stabilized slightly, resulting in a drop of 10 yuan compared to the previous closing. The Hong Kong exchange rate was affected by the suspension of Da Heng, and operators were concerned. Buyers waited and watched, retreating to 680 yuan to 690 yuan. Indian exchange was 840 yuan, British exchange was 11,250 yuan, and the quoted price of the US exchange rate showed a shortage of supply.</p>
<p>[Reuters Hong Kong, 4th] Today, the Hong Kong exchange rate opened at 14.5 Hong Kong dollars to 10,000 legal currency.</p>
<h3>Bulls Shift Direction Upon Seeing Wind, Unified Bonds Decline</h3>
<p>The public bond bulls finally gave way. Unified C bonds opened in the morning and had already fallen to 2,200 yuan. At the high price of 2,260 yuan, they were killed by the bulls and gradually moved downstream. The 2,000 yuan level was soon broken. It fell to a low price of 1.78 million in the middle of the day, and then short covering maintained it. It struggled at around 1.85 million at closing, resulting in a drop of 570,000 compared to the previous closing. A and B fell by 250,000, Type D fell by 350,000, and Type E also fell by 300,000. The Securities Exchange temporarily did not auction unified bonds, and people's hearts were unsettled.</p>
<h3>Chartered Bank Pays Interim Dividend</h3>

<h3>Da Heng Implements Liquidation, Defends its Contribution to Channeling Overseas Remittances, Petitions the Ministry of Finance to Withdraw the Order</h3>
<p>Da Heng Bank, located at 49 Ningbo Road in this city, was ordered to cease operations and liquidate by the Ministry of Finance for violating foreign exchange control regulations and privately operating foreign exchange business for profit. Yesterday, it was learned that the bank had suspended collection at its Shanghai branch starting yesterday, continued to pay out normally, and implemented liquidation. At the same time, it listed various facts and petitioned the Ministry of Finance to withdraw the order. Dong Ganwen, the manager of the bank, made a statement, claiming that: This firm was established in Hong Kong in the tenth year of the Republic of China, specializing in agency remittance business for overseas Chinese. It applied to the Central Bank to be a designated bank, but did not receive a reply. However, this firm holds a large amount of Hong Kong exchange in its affiliated firms in Hong Kong, and remits them to the country at any time. It entrusts this firm purely as an agent and does not engage in private operations. According to statistics, the foreign exchange sold by this firm is limited to the purchase of ships, machinery, cotton, pigments, and industrial raw materials, except for a small amount of private living expenses. Therefore, the operation of foreign exchange by this bank not only has no intention of disrupting finance, but also greatly benefits the national economy and the people's livelihood. Looking back in the past, whenever the market's foreign exchange fluctuated excessively, this firm would release a large amount of foreign exchange for sale to meet the needs of legitimate importers, and the foreign exchange market price would often be suppressed as a result. If overseas Chinese hold foreign exchange and there is no firm to channel and release it, it will flow into the hands of speculators, and the harm to Yu Rong will be even more unimaginable. In addition to petitioning for the withdrawal of the order, the Shanghai branch will be temporarily liquidated to comply with the law.</p>
<h3>Rayon Prices Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rayon Textile Construction Company did not list prices and will open sales today. Therefore, the black market price rose sharply again. 120-count "Tian Qiao You Guang" was called 2.45 million in the morning, and raised further to 600,000 in the afternoon, with the highest being 650,000, an increase of more than 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day. However, the price increase was too high, and few transactions were made. In the afternoon, miscellaneous brand 120-count "You Guang" was traded at 565,000, and "Guang" at 2.05 million, with the former being about 200,000 yuan higher than the previous day, and the latter being 150,000 yuan higher. Factory prices were stable because of tight credit. There was no power to rise. The selling price of seasonal silk goods increased slightly. For example, the selling prices of "Minsheng" Xin Yan Jin and Qiu Si Zhou increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, Hua Jin Zhou increased by 100 yuan, and the rest were firm.</p>
<h3>Japonica and Indica Rice Rebound, Oil Prices Plummet</h3>
<p>The rice market was connected to both suppliers and consumers. New japonica rice was still scarce, and white rice was still lacking. There was little old japonica rice. Shops were still eager to accept it. Indica rice rebounded by more than 1,000 yuan, and white rice remained firm. The situation of new japonica rice was tight, and old japonica rice was deserted. Old jian rice was also gradually declining, and new goods were the majority. The retail sales of flour were sluggish, falling by 100 yuan. Wheat from Fujian and Yong were active but not strong. There were few transactions, slightly down by 300 to 500 yuan. Northern white wheat was also less intake.</p>
<p>The supply of soybeans exceeded demand. The price of new lower and medium-grade beans continued to fall by 500 to 600 yuan. The price of old beans was flat due to scarcity. The supply of broad beans from various sources was strong, especially the selected green goods from Zhejiang Province, which fell sharply by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and there were still few transactions. The price of raw peanuts from the Cantonese gang did not move and the local market was watching, falling sharply by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan, and it still felt sluggish. The price of bran fell slightly by 100 to 200 yuan. The supply of oil to the market was slightly more. If the goods were good, they could attract distant customers. Shops were hesitant to take stock and had no intention of purchasing, and market prices fell sharply by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan and it was still difficult to stand firm.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Fall Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to soften, and actual sales were also watching and did little. The price of medium white sugar continued to fall by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan, gradually approaching the par value. In the afternoon, the Taiwan Sugar Company opened a batch of medium white sugar to various sugar firms in Taiwan at a par value of 140,000 yuan. The exact quantity is not yet suitable to be announced. Only scattered transactions were made for goods of different brands, including Shantou Chongtiqing at 128,000 yuan for 50 bags, Xinghua white at 165,000 yuan, and Xinghua red at 136,700 yuan, all down by a few thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>About 5,000 Loads of Autumn Cocoons, Loans Still Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>The autumn cocoon maturation period will arrive in two weeks. Various manufacturers have not yet settled the spring silk advance payment, so the current urgent task is not only the autumn cocoon loan issue. If the purchase of raw silk is based on a uniform D-grade quality of 78 points and 2-3 stripes, the value is estimated at 3.8 million yuan per load, which is about 40 billion yuan. According to silk industry sources, the purchase price of dry cocoons is 2.2 million yuan per load, the reeling cost is 1 million yuan, and the interest is about 600,000 yuan, plus insurance management fees, which is a considerable amount. If purchases are made early, consumption and losses can be reduced. The autumn cocoon loan issue is being actively promoted by all parties. Representatives from relevant parties are discussing and stipulating the number of cocoon banks to be purchased, loans, distribution, reduction of consumption, and pricing. It is also learned that it is estimated that 5,000 loads of autumn cocoons can be harvested, and the estimated loan is 150 million yuan, and the reeling cost is about 5 billion yuan. Manufacturers are responsible for the purchase, and the China Silk Company provides guidance.</p>
<h3>Festival Season Approaches, Credit Tightens, Securities Black Market Sluggish</h3>
<p>The Shanghai stock market was sluggish, and all stocks fell in unison, especially small and unpopular stocks. In the early morning, they were still stable. The high prices were 648 yuan for Yongsha, 3,850 yuan for Meiya, 255 yuan for Jingfu, 275 yuan for Xinguang, and 195 yuan for Qinyu. Soon, they gradually turned weak and eventually fell under the lack of support and pressure from tight credit. However, Meiya was still relatively stable. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yongsha and Meiya fell slightly, and Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing fell by about half a percentage point. The prices of smaller mid-sized stocks also fell slightly by about half a percentage point. Old stocks showed a slight rebound.</p>
<p>Securities dealers in foreign stocks, in view of the news that foreign stocks would not be listed, continued to close out positions. As a result, the popular large stocks continued to move downstream, while the small stocks were more stable. Old bulls and Western merchants added to their positions at low prices, which provided support, and the situation was mediocre. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yisha and Yinglian fell by half a percentage point, Yeguang was flat, and the rest fell but not much.</p>
<h3>Japanese Goods Can Arrive Next Week, China Trust Will Sell in Batches</h3>
<p>The quantity of rayon we ordered from Japan is extremely large. According to He Molin, manager of the barter department of the China Trust Bureau, the first batch of orders will arrive next week. In order to avoid severe fluctuations in the market, it was decided to sell them in batches and directly allocate them to silk weaving factories, rather than buying and selling in the market. Local factories in this city entrust the China Textile Company to allocate them, and the out-of-town factories are directly distributed by the Wood Bureau. It is expected that rayon, which is currently rising sharply, will tend to stabilize.</p>
<h3>Banking Industry Ordered to Extend Business Hours</h3>

<h3>Tianjin Central Branch Plans to Directly Handle Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>[Tianjin, 4th] Bian Xisun, manager of the Tianjin branch of the Central Bank, said that when foreign exchange was first opened, foreign trade had not yet returned to normal, so only the Shanghai head office was allowed to settle foreign exchange. In the future, foreign trade in various places will become more frequent, especially in Tianjin, which is more important. In order to facilitate import and export merchants, it has been approved by the head office to establish a foreign exchange department in the Tianjin branch, and recently requested the head office to allow the bank to directly settle foreign exchange with foreign countries. If approved, trade merchants and designated banks will be greatly facilitated.</p>

The Chamber of Commerce now received a reply from the Ministry of Finance on August 29 stating: "The telegram is understood. In order to consider the difficulties of merchants, the Ministry has already halved the current business tax rate.

<h3>Chiang Chairman's Hometown</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper, Fenghua Dispatch on the 22nd, Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>Natural environments can influence a person's temperament and learning; the growth of a person is undoubtedly greatly related to the place where they grow up. For example, when we were in Shaoxing, we felt an environment of profound simplicity, purity, and perseverance, which is why we have the story of King Goujian of Yue. Also, when we were in Yuyao, we felt the beauty of the rivers and mountains and the pleasant scenery, which is why we have such virtuous predecessors as Yan Ziling, Wang Yangming, Zhu Shunshui, and Huang Lizhou. We are in Ningbo, which is indeed a transportation hub; therefore, commerce is thriving, and most people make a living by doing business. Fenghua, adjacent to Ningbo, is the hometown of Chiang Chairman of our National Government. Our respect for this great figure naturally makes us think of the natural environment of his hometown.</p>
<p>On the third day after arriving in Ningbo, we went to Fenghua. There were many stones on the road, and it was not very smooth. After crossing the Jiangkou Bridge, which is the only new construction project of the Ministry of Transportation on this highway, we arrived at Fenghua City.</p>
<p>Fenghua has an area of more than five thousand square li, with more than three hundred thousand mu of arable land and a population of two hundred and thirty thousand people. Here, there are two county-run Fenghua middle schools, namely, Taiqing middle school, and elementary schools such as Jinxi elementary school. Fenghua middle school was founded during the Guangxu period of the late Qing Dynasty, originally named Fenglu middle school, and was where Chairman Chiang studied in his youth. When we arrived at Fenghua middle school, we saw that the windows and other parts had been damaged, and it was very dilapidated. Local people are planning to revive the school. Jinxi elementary school was originally Jinxi academy, later changed to elementary school, and Chairman Chiang also graduated from this school.</p>
<p>Fenghua County is not very big. There is a large bridge about three li away from the city, connecting Ninghai, Ningbo, and other places, so commerce is more prosperous than in Fenghua City.</p>
<p>The county seat is built against the mountain, and Phoenix Mountain does resemble a phoenix.</p>
<p>Fenghua County is built against Phoenix Mountain, and Phoenix Mountain does resemble a phoenix. Local people say that "Fenghua" was originally called "Fenghua," with the mountain resembling a phoenix and the county seat resembling a flower. During the Song Dynasty, talented people emerged in large numbers, and the academic atmosphere was also strong. During the Yuan Dynasty, a county magistrate, out of jealousy of Fenghua's culture, ordered the county residents to temporarily relocate and rebuilt the county seat into the shape of a large knife. At the phoenix head of the county seat, he specially nailed dozens of wooden stakes and long iron nails. From then on, Fenghua had no famous people. During the Qing Dynasty, if a county resident became the county magistrate, he was respected by the entire county. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, before the revolution, Mr. Zhou Rixuan, a revolutionary predecessor, removed all the wooden stakes and nails. As a result, Fenghua entered an era of talented people again. This is just a story circulating among the people of Fenghua, but the fact that Phoenix Mountain resembles a phoenix is indeed true. Now, the late Mr. Zhou Rixuan is buried next to the Confucian temple. Mr. Zhou was one of the people admired by Chairman Chiang, so Chairman Chiang funded the construction of his tomb.</p>
<p>Many of the buildings in Fenghua City have also been destroyed. The county territory has Siming Mountain, so it is not very peaceful. The only task now is how to stabilize order and revive construction.</p>
<p>The road from Fenghua City to Xikou in the county is also not very smooth. There are several wooden bridges among them, which are in danger of collapsing. We are worried that if Chairman Chiang returns to his hometown, it will make him feel the hardship of a journey after his hard work.</p>
<p>Mentioning Wenchang Pavilion, there are still lingering fears and shocks.</p>
<p>We have arrived at Xikou. After moving forward dozens of steps, we arrived at Wuling Gate. The magnificent buildings inside the gate are Wuling Hospital and Wuling School. In front of the school is a mound with Wenchang Pavilion on it. Next to the pavilion, there was originally a modern residential building, which was where Chairman Chiang stayed, but it has been bombed by the enemy and no longer exists. It is said that at that time, the enemy obtained intelligence that Chairman Chiang had returned to his hometown and was living in this house, so they launched heavy bombers to bomb it fiercely. Therefore, the people of Xikou still have lingering fears and anger when they mention the bombing of Wenchang Pavilion. Climbing Wenchang Pavilion, you can see the stream winding from afar to its feet.</p>
<p>Wuling School was damaged, but now it has been repaired.</p>
<p>Wuling School has junior high and elementary schools. This year, a high school has been added, with more than seven hundred students. Students in Xikou do not have to pay for their education; everything is free. The school has a hospital, a training field, a forest farm, and a canning factory. Chairman Chiang himself concurrently serves as the school director. Mr. Shi Jiyan is the principal, and there are more than thirty faculty members. Mr. Shi said: "When it was recovered, Wuling School was so devastated that it was unbearable to look at. Everything now has been recently repaired." I asked how much the monthly expenses were, and he said, "It's not too much because Chairman Chiang himself is also poor!" The architecture of the school building is a mix of Chinese and Western styles, with Chinese-style roofs and Western-style buildings. Many of the interior decorations are antique. Mr. Shi also said: "When this school was founded, it began to operate a farm. Now, the farm's products are almost self-sufficient. Vegetables in Xikou were originally very expensive. For example, vegetables that cost more than two hundred yuan per catty on the market now cost us only seventy yuan per catty."</p>
<p>The stream in Xikou is called Yanxi, originating from Sheng County. Sheng County originates from Dongyang, Tiantai, and Wuyi counties. Yanxi flows through Xikou and is also called Jinxi. Most of the stream bed is exposed, with many pebbles, and only small boats can twist and turn through it. I still remember the poem of the ancients: "Wearing a bay, rushing through the rapids, a single sail passes, resting my head and chanting softly to Yan." But it is completely different. Mr. Shen Chengzhang pointed to the stream in front of me and told me, "When I came here in the 25th year of the Republic (1936), bamboo rafts were following each other in this stream, but now it has gradually dried up, so Xikou must pay attention to water conservancy." He also said, "In the 25th year of the Republic, I came here with Mr. Xu Yuanquan, stayed at Wuling School, ate at Chairman Chiang's house, and visited famous scenic spots all day."</p>
<p>The old house is simple and unadorned; workers are hired to nail and decorate.</p>
<p>From Wuling School, a small road built of cement leads up, which is exceptionally flat. A row of cement pillars and poles, built along the river, about one hundred yards, is the main street. The buildings on both sides of the street, which are not very tall, have some small shops, a telegraph office, and a post office. Passing the Chiang family ancestral hall, there is a plaque in front of the door that reads: "Loyalty and Filial Piety Passed Down Through Generations," written by Chairman Chiang. Further ahead is the old house, which is not luxurious but very simple. Passing through the round door of the white powder wall, there are two words "Su Ju" (Simple Residence) written on the door. Inside are several courtyards of Chinese-style houses, with a hall in the middle where the shrines are placed. The portrait of Chiang's mother, Madam Wang, is placed in the middle, with several chairs and tables inlaid with marble on both sides. Turning inside, there are six modern houses, which are also very ordinary. All the houses have been greatly damaged by the enemy. Now, two or three workers have been hired to nail and install.</p>
<p>The birds in the pine forest chirp and sing the praises of Chiang's mother's achievements.</p>
<p>Walking two kilometers to the foot of Yulin'ao, climbing the steps, the ground is full of green, and the pine forest is dense. A few birds chirping can be heard from the bushes, which is praising Chiang's mother's achievements. Climbing three li to Chiang's mother's tomb hut. Entering the door, there is a plaque with the words "Ci An" (Kind Hermitage), written by Tan Yankai. Behind it is a pavilion with a stone tablet in the middle, inscribed with the text of the national father's memorial to Chiang's mother. Behind the tablet is inscribed Chairman Chiang's account of his mother's deeds, written by Yu Youren. There are six stone tablets on both walls, all of which are texts praising Chairman Chiang by the Kuomintang of the National Government of China. Connecting to the two sides of the tablet pavilion, the right side is Chairman Chiang's bedroom, with a sofa chair and a round tea table. The bed is placed on the right middle side of the entrance, with a table next to the bed, and a dressing table on the right side, with a long oval mirror. Under the mirror is a porcelain white horse, with a lifelike posture. Opposite the dressing table, there is a wardrobe with a white porcelain goose on it. On the left end, there is a fireplace. According to Mr. Jiang Guoquan, who went with us, "This fireplace is for burning firewood." To the left of the fireplace, there are two washrooms and toilets.</p>
<p>The room on the left side of the tablet pavilion is a reception room, with sofas, tables, and chairs inside.</p>
<p>The stone tablet was damaged by the enemy; Miaogao Terrace was even more tragic.</p>
<p>Further to the left, there are four or five bungalows, presumably for kitchens and other uses. The curtains in each room are made of cloth. According to Mr. Jiang Lixiang, who went with us, "When it was recovered, the stone tablet was damaged by the enemy, and the chairman's bedroom was used as a stable by the enemy. The houses were so badly damaged that they were uninhabitable. Now they have all been recently repaired, and the chairman has not seen them yet!" I asked where Chairman Chiang usually lived when he came to Xikou. He said, "There are also a few small houses on Miaogao Terrace, where the chairman lives when he travels in the mountains. Although he sometimes lives in Wenchang Pavilion, it is not for long. The place where he lives the most is of course here." I also asked about the extent of the damage to the houses on Miaogao Terrace. He said, "The damage is even worse. Now it has also been newly repaired. The chairman has not seen all the equipment, and I don't know if he is satisfied?"</p>
<p>Following the mountain path, we reached Chiang's mother's tomb. The national father's handwriting "Chiang's Mother's Tomb" is inscribed on the stone tablet. We paid our respects and lingered for a long time. We saw that a mountain range in front of us was like a screen. Under the range, there were hundreds of thousands of acres of fertile land. Looking into the distance, the mountains on all sides were majestic and elegant, magnificent and grand. It is still twenty-five li to Miaogao Terrace and Xuebao Temple. Miaogao Terrace is located on Siming Mountain, with tall and verdant pine forests and fragrant wildflowers. The chairman's residence is built there, which is also a very simple and plain two-story building with eight rooms. Three li across from it is Xuesi Temple. Mr. Yu Jimin, who accompanied me, told me: "In the past, the monks in the temple often treated guests poorly. In the 25th year of the Republic (1936), the former chairman, Mr. Lin Sen, came here with a simple entourage and was also treated poorly. Therefore, Mr. Zeng Yangfu and others built houses fifty meters away from the temple and set up the China Travel Service to treat tourists well. In the summer of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), Mr. Zhang Xueliang came and stayed here, and a fire broke out due to electricity, destroying almost everything. The foundation still remains."</p>
<p>Near the temple, there is a Qianzhang Cliff, which is unfathomable when viewed from above. The waterfall is like a white silk, rushing down. When Mr. Zhang Xueliang came here, he lit firecrackers and threw them under the cliff, and the sound was so loud that it seemed like the mountain was collapsing. Moving forward and spiraling down to Shangyintan, the surrounding cliffs are steep, with only one road accessible. The fine rain is drifting and dancing in the wind, making one feel cool and refreshed. Going down to Zhongyintan and Xiayintan, they are all rare scenic spots.</p>
<p>The scenery of Xikou is magnificent, and the losses are also considerable.</p>
<p>The scenery of Xikou can be said to be magnificent, but the losses during the war are also very considerable. It was bombed by enemy planes thirteen times, and after the fall, it was damaged by enemy puppet bandits. According to statistics, 217 people were shot to death, 73 people were kidnapped and missing, 128 Western-style houses were completely burned down, 630 multi-story buildings, 702 single-story buildings, 95 Western-style houses were half-destroyed, 1,360 multi-story buildings, 470 single-story buildings, 15,000 piculs of rice were lost, 230,000 catties of grain, 377 cattle, 648 pigs, more than 4,800 large trees, 1.5 million bamboos, more than 2,000 boxes of tea, and 98 self-defense firearms. Putting it all together, this number is also very considerable.</p>
<p>There is a police station in the town, with only twelve policemen including the police chief. The salary of each policeman is only more than 8,000 yuan, which is not particularly generous. Even Chairman Chiang's residence is not as good as the Pan Villa where we spent a night at the foot of Tianmu Mountain. Mr. Yu Jimin told me, "In the past, Commander Liu Maoen went to Xikou to visit Chairman Chiang. When he came back, he said to people, 'I thought the hometown of someone who is concerned with the safety of the country must be very luxurious, but seeing Mr. Chiang so simple really makes us ashamed!'"</p>

<h3>Responding to Readers - Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(1) Family Disputes</p>
<p>Chen Xin asks: A was betrothed to B at the age of thirteen by his parents' arrangement and the words of a matchmaker. They were married hastily in the 24th year of the Republic (1935) without a major ceremony (commonly known as "worshipping at the stove"). They now have four children. In the summer of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), B suddenly suffered from mental illness, which was cured after two months of treatment. A now intends to divorce B. There are three questions:</p>
<p>(1) Are couples married by "worshipping at the stove" in the countryside legally married? (2) Can having suffered from mental illness that has now been cured be grounds for divorce? (3) In the spring of this year (the 35th year of the Republic, 1946), A and B had a lawyer notarize a separation agreement, each holding a copy as proof. How can they proceed with a thorough divorce? Does it need to be resolved in court?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin replies:] (1) Marriages made by worshipping at the stove in the countryside can be regarded as customary law and do not constitute an illegal condition for marriage, as long as there was a public ceremony at the time and two or more witnesses, it is legal. (2) Only a serious and incurable mental illness can constitute grounds for divorce. (3) If the woman is also willing to divorce, both parties should write a divorce agreement, each holding a copy as proof. Otherwise, a divorce suit must be filed in court, but only if the woman has conditions that constitute grounds for divorce.</p>
<p>(2) Returning Engagement Gifts and Debts</p>
<p>Wang Yinzhi asks: My friend, Ms. Li, was engaged to a certain gentleman several years ago. Now, due to disagreements, she wants to terminate the engagement, and the other party, knowing that it cannot be forced, also agrees. However, he demands that all the assistance he voluntarily gave in the past be returned, calculated at five thousand times the original amount. Is this request legal?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin replies:] To determine whether to increase the calculation by a certain multiple when repaying old debts, both parties should negotiate in a fair manner. This is a factual matter, and the law does not explicitly specify any increase in multiples. If both parties cannot reach an agreement, they can only resort to the court for resolution.</p>
<p>(3) Wang Dake asks: When I was fifteen years old, my parents arranged for me to be engaged to a girl through a matchmaker. I absolutely disagree with this engagement. Now I have another girlfriend, and we hope to spend our lives together, but because of the previous agreement, I cannot get engaged. I have repeatedly urged my parents to terminate the previous agreement, and although my parents have agreed, they have been slow to do so. I have several questions, please answer:</p>
<p>(1) Is this engagement valid without my consent? Do my parents have the right to force me to fulfill it? (2) Is it a crime to get engaged to my girlfriend now? Does the previous agreement have any binding effect on me? Do I have to terminate it first? Who should terminate the engagement? (3) Is it valid if the parents do not preside over the engagement and marriage? (4) What is the standard for the age of adulthood for men and women?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin replies:] (1) Engagements should be entered into by the man and woman themselves, and others should not force them. (2) Since you do not agree to the previous engagement, you or your parents can come forward to negotiate the termination with the other party. If the other party is not at fault, you should also pay them reasonable compensation for damages. This damage is not limited to property damage. After the engagement is terminated, you can get engaged to someone else. (3) There is no need for parents to preside, but there must be a public ceremony and two or more witnesses. Twenty years old is considered adulthood.</p>

<h3>Daoyi Society Distributes Coffins</h3>
<p>The Daoyi Society of Ying Shi Road Middle School, adhering to the principle of Daoyi, is concerned about all charitable causes and earnestly carries them out. In the summer, they provide free medical consultations, medicine, and tea, and in the winter, they provide free clothing and porridge. They have never slackened in their efforts to provide assistance according to the seasons. Seeing that those who die without coffins are extremely pitiful, they have expanded their coffin distribution program to help families who cannot afford funerals. Thanks to the generosity of four great philanthropists, Xia Yanqing, Li Runtian, Li Xiaoyan, and Wang Juji, who donated a large batch of planks worth about 4 million yuan, workers have been hired to rush to make coffins. Anyone who is impoverished, dies, and cannot afford a funeral can apply to our society through the social service office, and a certificate from the local Baojia head is required.</p>

<h3>Approved to Proceed Upstream</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper’s 24th Dispatch from Huainan — Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi</p>
<p>The Absurdity of Tianjia'an</p>
<p>Considering the entire Anhui province, Tianjia'an is truly its heart. Every day at five o'clock, a single engine is dispatched from the Jiulonggang depot, pulling a train eastward towards Bengbu that departs at eight in the morning. Today, I arrived here by train and then transferred to a connecting Huainan Road steamer to Zhengyangguan.</p>
<p>As dawn gradually broke, the dilapidated Tianjia'an was revealed in increasing clarity. The dock on the water's edge has been unused for eight years and is now completely submerged by the Huai River. The broken trestle looks like the skeleton of a giant beast, protruding from the water, as if lamenting its past glory.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Qian, who presided over the Construction Committee, came here excitedly to hold a groundbreaking ceremony when the Huai Road was being built. His achievements have been swallowed up one by one in the flood of history. This road is a testament to his legacy. Tianjia'an is quiet and ruined, its scale still discernible. This is truly the most heartbreaking and tragic sight.</p>
<p>At that time, the business revenue from the Yu Road ranked second in the country in terms of average kilometers, with the Zhengtai Road ranking first. With a monthly income of 600,000, a bank loan interest payment of 100,000, and expenses of 180,000, there was a net surplus of 320,000. The Huainan Coal Mine was not even included. This was a good source of income for the country. After the Construction Committee concluded, the capital of the Construction Bank was incorporated, gradually turning it into a private enterprise. Currently, without this huge private capital investment, the smooth commencement of operations at the Datong and Huainan mines would be quite problematic.</p>
<p>Under the Huainan Company are the Mining and Railway Bureaus. As for the Railway Bureau, needless to say, the Director Wu Jingqing, Deputy Director Wu Weizhong, and Ning Shufan are all capable men. The latter two are veterans of Huainan. Ning once managed the China Merchants Bureau's business during the Anti-Japanese War, handling it not only with ease but also with familiarity. However, they are currently operating trains on a borrowed line, and the restoration of the Tianyu track is both within reach and seemingly out of reach. The present is a period of distress. As for the Director of the Mining Bureau, Wang Dezi (mistakenly written as Ning in the previous section), he was the mine manager of Datong before the war, with Xie Jigang and Li Jing as Deputy Mine Managers. The reason why Datong Mine was incorporated into the Huainan Company was due to the convenience of merging, but in fact, it also had its own capital difficulties. In today's China, it is truly not easy for genuine private capital to be put to use.</p>
<p>Seeing the miserable state of Tianjia'an, I felt quite emotional. No one knows how many people live in Tianjia'an, it is said that even the town chief himself doesn't know. It borders the Huai River to the north, belongs to Huaiyuan County, and adjoins Fengtai and Shou Counties. From here, south to Shuijia Lake, this narrow strip of land is bordered by Huanggu Dang to the east, Wabu Lake to the west, and the Huai River to the north, making it surrounded by water on three sides. Anhui's notorious bandits have all gathered here at some point. It is said that the likes of Sun Meiyao and "Big Braid Zhang" all had their golden age here. Quite a few people have also started their careers here and "turned over a new leaf." The opening of the Huainan Road has precisely disrupted this old nest. However, the term "atmosphere," while seemingly abstract, is actually concrete. The "heroes" who commit crimes in the three counties still tend to use this place as a sanctuary. Almost every household in this area has firearms. The people are happy to seek out weapons and never tire of it. When the Japanese army was stationed in this mining area, they dismantled houses from Taixian to build barracks. After the surrender, many guns were sold. A handgun could be obtained for 1,000 yuan, and a Type 38 rifle for less than 1,000. It truly found its place. "Civilian armed forces" are thriving. It's not like when the Japanese devils were here, when one couldn't play around casually.</p>
<p>Twenty days ago, a robbery occurred next door to the military camp here. Some say it's because there are many demobilized soldiers, others say it's</p>
<p>The newly repaired dike, with the Zhun River on its right. The masts of the sailboats are lined up, and the water level is several meters higher than the ground on the left side of the dike.</p>
<p>are traveling bandits, looking for a few coins. In short, people are panic-stricken. There are indeed a considerable number of demobilized soldiers, coming from Henan or northern Anhui, transferring through here to Jinpu, Nanjing, or southern Anhui. Officers have officers' teams to join, but most go to seek their own employment—of course, still mainly military-related. They travel with their families, lack travel funds, and are extremely temperamental. However, everyone forgives and sympathizes with them, but this is just empty talk and does not help in reality.</p>
<p>Speaking of bandits, if you go more than ten miles east down the Huai River, in places like Old Shipyard and Matoucheng, it is said that there are one or two thousand people on both banks, with machine guns. Merchant ships often have accidents. A small number of ships dare not sail alone. They must join together in groups of two or three hundred and request military escort, passing by in a mighty, boisterous procession. Being in the midst of it is certainly tense and truly spectacular. Unfortunately, I dare not try it and cannot tell you about the experience.</p>
<p>The new garrison commander got angry because the town chief didn't even know the number of residents. Now, they are finally checking the household registration. A pile of yellow earth and thatched huts—it's simply impossible to describe its characteristics. This is a typical small market town common in northern Anhui. Honest businessmen cannot easily establish themselves. Local thugs will definitely stir things up and ruin you. However, the place where they can roam most freely is the gambling den, which is very prosperous. People gamble to the point of madness, often with real knives and guns.</p>
<p>There are "unreliable" small hotels, whose scale is not even as good as the "Treasure Hotels" in Yuchengjiang, Guangxi, or Jieshou, Henan. As soon as travelers from Bengbu arrive at Zhengyangguan, they immediately rush onto the Huainan Road steamers for connecting transportation, even if it means sleeping in the open. Of course, on the one hand, it is also for a few coins. Observing the declining and absurd Tianjia'an, one truly cannot believe that this is China. "You'll know once you go up there. This whole area is like this," a mine policeman said seriously to me. Therefore, I thought of people like Zhang... and I also expressed my admiration for the gentlemen of the Road and Mining Bureaus currently in the bunkers. I also want to wish many travelers (including myself) and all the heroes well. (Photos by Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi)</p>
<p>Upstream on the Huai River</p>
<p>Between Tianjia'an and Zhengyangguan, it takes nine hours upstream and five hours downstream. State-run and commercially-run transportation services have no fixed schedule after purchasing tickets. They only operate when they can make a profit. The Huainan Road operates two steamers daily on this section, connecting with the train. As a result, the business of these state-run and commercially-run services has been completely taken over. They have opened up another route, rushing to the Ying River to open Fuyang and Jieshou—one of the famous smuggling dens during the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>Now, departing west from Tianjia'an is an ordinary inland river small steamer, towing a large wooden barge, the old No. 6 coal boat of the Datong Mine before the war. Old Huai River sailors can still name and recount the experiences of each boat. They all regret that many good boats were pulled to Zhengyangguan and burned for firewood during the retreat. They show no interest in this old boat. "It's like people," said an old sailor, "The young and strong on the Huai River are either dead or gone, and only we old useless ones are still hanging on."</p>
<p>He seemed quite ashamed of "still hanging on." "Still hanging on" is another way of saying succumbing to fate, but he doesn't think so, which shows his character and customs.</p>
<p>The scope of his words is too broad, encompassing the entire eight years from the Anti-Japanese War to the present. War, famine, plague, as well as his own increasing aging and poverty. I sat in the cabin at the stern of the wooden barge, watching the armed road patrol police with live ammunition. A machine gun was mounted on the bow. If a small boat approached, they would immediately fire a warning shot to make it go away. As for the turbulent Huai River and the widespread disaster area, I gained a clearer understanding of them by boat. The higher we went upstream, the more ferocious the yellow water became. If it weren't for the treetops and rooftops sticking out, what we passed through would almost have been a Yellow Sea. The old captain was able to distinguish the location of the river channel by relying on the indication of these treetops. Such a large disaster situation does not attract serious attention from the whole country, and the people in the disaster area remain silent. This is truly a cold China! Not a single responsible official comes here to take a look, yet they talk about being the vanguard of the people and shirk responsibility. When it comes to disaster relief, all they talk about is money. These are not the kind of officials that the Chinese people need.</p>
<p>The people on the boat were all cold, all disaster-stricken people, only saying "listen to fate," and believing that everything else should be "forgotten." They carried their own goods, transporting a little bit of cargo from Bengbu. Among them was a middle-aged woman from Fuyang, who, because she was looking for the corpses of her husband and son, first followed the Ying River to Zhengyangguan, then followed the Huai River to Tianjia'an, but to no avail. Today, she was returning in disappointment. More than twenty days ago, a small steamer departed from Zhengyang and went straight to Jieshou, loaded with people and goods. After passing Fuyang, it encountered a large whirlpool of yellow water, overturning the boat. The boat was found forty miles downstream, and only four passengers were pulled out of the cabin, still with some breath left, and were eventually rescued. The rest were all missing. The woman said, "It's all destined." She didn't blame anyone, so she seemed very calm in her grief. This event further increased the tragedy.</p>
<p>Arriving at Zhengyangguan, the yellow water was pouring out of the Ying River. Zhengyangguan was almost completely submerged. At its worst, only one square mile was not flooded. Now that the water has receded a little, Zhengyangguan still has only two square kilometers where one can walk without getting wet feet. Surrounded by water on all sides, only an isolated island remains. Our steamer traveled through the fields, with the rooftops being the best land. I will introduce this painful Zhengyangguan in another article.</p>
<p>Correction: In the "Approved to Proceed Upstream (1)" section, in the "Silent Disaster Area" section, there is an estimate of the disaster area being approximately 50,000 square kilometers. The word "万" (wan, ten thousand) is a mistake for "千" (qian, thousand). This is now specifically corrected as above. A scene of the Huainan flood (Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi)</p>

<h3>Taiwan Tropical Medicine Research Institute</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper’s 23rd Dispatch from Taipei — Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun</p>
<p>During the period of Japanese rule, Taiwan was treated as a part of Japan. In addition to the policy of extracting resources, they tried their best to overcome the threats posed by natural geography through scientific research. In particular, they needed to encourage Japanese mainlanders to reproduce in Taiwan, and they needed to exchange one share of financial resources for three shares of labor from the local population. Therefore, the development of tropical medicine research for health care and hygiene was inevitable.</p>
<p>Japan does not have a subtropical climate. Taiwan is truly "blessed by nature." In order to ensure the reduction of the death rate of Japanese mainlanders in Taiwan and their adaptation to tropical life, they spared no manpower and material resources in medicine. The Tropical Medicine Research Institute grew under such circumstances.</p>
<h3>Fake Medicines Rampant, Harming National Health</h3>
<p>The Tropical Medicine Research Institute, which has been established for 38 years, initially only had a Chemistry Department and a Hygiene Department. Later, it belonged to the Central Research Institute. Seven years ago, it was affiliated with National Taiwan University, becoming a major research institute coordinating with others related to the South Seas and the sugar industry. The outlines of the Department of Tropical Diseases, Department of Tropical Hygiene, Department of Bacterial Immunology, Department of Chemistry, Department of Nutrition, and Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, which are established in the institute, show that they not only focus on the research, investigation, experimentation, and prevention of tropical diseases, but also include nutritional physiology and pathology, as well as the analysis and identification of medicines, directly and indirectly serving the patients, pharmaceutical manufacturing, medical treatment, research, and maintenance of health in tropical regions.</p>
<p>Dr. Chen Lijie, who presides over the institute's affairs, told the reporter: "The institute has three branch offices in Shilin, Taichung, and Tainan. Shilin is the experimental site for bacterial and immunological products, while the branch offices in Taichung and Tainan specialize in the experimentation, inspection, and sealing of medical and hygiene medicines. Medicines brought to Taiwan during the Japanese era needed to be inspected and sealed by the institute before they could be sold. Approximately 30,000 items were inspected each year. This law was abolished after the restoration. Although more than 10,000 items are still being inspected, the fake medicines sold by fraudulent merchants are very rampant. This is not only a hidden danger for Taiwan, but it directly harms national health!"</p>
<h3>Mass Production, Not Afraid of Infectious Bacteria</h3>
<p>Taiwan is not afraid of the inflow of infectious diseases. The plague brought from Fuzhou and the cholera invading from the south raged for some time. Because of the rapid measures taken by the health authorities and the institute's production of 1.4 million doses of plague vaccine in two weeks, and the regular supply of cholera vaccine, distributed to various counties and cities for preventive injections, the life-threatening plague was quickly eliminated. This base for destroying epidemics is the Shilin Research Branch.</p>
<p>The institute not only produces various preventive vaccines, including diphtheria, rabies, meningitis, cholera, plague, etc., but also produces diphtheria serum, pertussis, smallpox vaccine, etc. for treatment. Normally, various biological products such as serum, vaccines, and smallpox vaccine can produce 300,000 doses per month, and can be increased to 3 million doses when necessary. From the time of reception in December of last year to July, they produced 8,615,386 doses of injections and 43,373 CC of serum, including:</p>
<p>Typhoid vaccine: 49,760 doses</p>
<p>Plague vaccine: 1,228,844 doses</p>
<p>Epidemic Cerebrospinal Meningitis Bacteria: 742,520 doses</p>
<p>Cholera vaccine: 2,816,530 doses</p>
<p>Typhoid and Paratyphoid Mixed Vaccine: 808,440 doses</p>
<p>Measles vaccine: 15 doses</p>
<p>Smallpox vaccine: 2,963,870 doses</p>
<p>Diphtheria Prophylactic: 3,440 doses</p>
<p>Pertussis vaccine: 595 doses</p>
<p>Dysentery vaccine: 1,200 doses</p>
<p>Hemorrhagic Toxic Polyvalent Serum: 156 doses</p>
<p>Neurotoxic Polyvalent Serum: 16 doses</p>
<p>Cholera Diagnostic Serum: 30 CC</p>
<p>Gas Gangrene Serum: 3,000 CC</p>
<p>Tetanus Serum: 13,160 CC</p>
<p>Epidemic Cerebrospinal Meningitis Serum:</p>
<p>1,120 CC</p>
<p>Diphtheria Serum: 27,060 CC</p>
<p>Pulmonary Tuberculosis Diagnostic Solution: 3 CC</p>
<p>These accurate numbers not only tell us that more than 16 kinds of pathogens can be prevented and treated with guarantees, but also show that they are doing solid disinfection work for mankind. They have not been affected by the reception and restoration. Although their research work was suspended for half a year, and the director has recently devoted himself to restoring it, this only applies to the general institute.</p>

<h3>Riding the Long Wind and Breaking Ten Thousand Miles of Waves: Notes from the "General Meigu" Ship</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingqian</p>
<p>The "General Meigu" is one of the main transport ships of the United States, with a deadweight tonnage of 22,000 tons. It had a brilliant contribution during the war. For example, in the US military's attack on Okinawa, it carried 7,000 soldiers from San Francisco in one trip, landing at Manila. The ship was also equipped with radar. Although there are still uncleared mines in the Pacific, everyone felt very safe. This time, it came to China to load American demobilized soldiers returning home, and also carried more than 500 passengers from various countries. There were about 200 Chinese passengers, the most passengers ever carried on this ship since the end of the war. On the 4th of last month, Mr. Huang Delu and I hurriedly carried our luggage onto the ship and spent the night on board.</p>
<p>Four Announcements from the Loudspeaker</p>
<p>On the morning of the 5th, the ship's loudspeaker broadcast several announcements: (1) Inspection of epidemic prevention certificates starts at 9:00 AM. (2) Passengers are requested not to go ashore, and are absolutely not allowed to go ashore. (3) The ship will set sail at 4:00 PM. (4) Gambling is not allowed after 12:00 midnight. The passengers, full of farewell emotions, began to feel nervous. At 9:00 AM, everyone held their epidemic prevention certificates, and the police officers sent by the Shanghai Customs came aboard to conduct the inspection. In the past, foreigners were protected by unequal treaties and were not subject to inspection. Since the abolition of unequal treaties, all foreign officers and soldiers and people from various countries on board, including Chinese passengers, must be inspected with certificates. This clearly shows that China's international status has indeed improved. Suddenly, a passenger was found to have smallpox and was immediately taken off the ship. If a person with infectious diseases such as smallpox or cholera is found on board in an American port, not only is the patient not allowed to go ashore, but the luggage of other passengers and even the hull of the ship must be disinfected and cleaned before being allowed to dock. Therefore, epidemic prevention is indeed one of the main tasks on board. At 4:00 PM, the ship set sail and slowly sailed out of the Wusongkou. Mr. Huang and I looked at each other and said, "A journey of ten thousand miles begins with a single step," riding the long wind and breaking ten thousand miles of waves.</p>
<p>The Pacific Ocean is Truly Peaceful</p>
<p>My home is in Meishan. When I was young, I read Mr. Su Dongpo's famous poem: "The river in my hometown first originates, official travels send the river directly into the sea." I explored the source of the river in Luokou, but I have never seen the magnificent sight of the water flowing into the Yangtze River and returning to the sea. This time, standing on the General Meigu ship and sailing through the place where the river flows into the sea, I truly felt the vastness of the ocean. The giant ship stood tall, and Chongming Island was faintly visible in the distance. Sometimes, sails rose and fell, and water gulls appeared and disappeared. The sea and sky were vast, and the scenery was very pleasant. It is said that there are three routes to San Francisco: (1) Via Hong Kong and Manila to San Francisco. (2) Via Yokohama and Honolulu to San Francisco. (3) Via the Sea of Japan, along the North Pacific Ocean, past the Aleutian Islands, and turning south directly to San Francisco. The "General Meigu" took this direct route because it could shorten the journey by two to three days. Usually, it takes at least half a month to travel from Shanghai to San Francisco via Honolulu. Since taking the direct route, it takes twelve days to reach San Francisco. However, in these twelve days of direct sailing on the ocean, not a single flower, grass, tree, or stone can be seen. The sky is connected to the water, and the water is connected to the sky. The snow waves, sunlight, sea gulls, whales, and the azure color of the water are the only wonders on the sea. In the vast void, infinite warmth and comfort are added. The route chart is based on the earth's longitude and latitude, and the direction is very accurate. The ship passed through the Sea of Japan and along the North Pacific Ocean, becoming colder and colder. On the twelfth day, when passing the Earth's Meridian, there was wind, rain, and dense fog, and the cold current hit people. Everyone had to wear cotton clothes. The passengers on the whole ship felt the pain of being tossed about. After passing this southwest, entering the Western Hemisphere, it became hotter and hotter. The ship's speed is about 18 knots per hour. I heard that the United States is rushing to build new ships, with a speed increased to 30 knots per hour. It takes six days to get from Shanghai to San Francisco. This is truly a signal of speed and convenience for future passengers. When leaving Shanghai, my friends raised their glasses to wish me a smooth journey. The stability of the ship made me grateful for my friends' blessings and prayers. The Pacific Ocean is truly peaceful!</p>
<p>Normally, the facilities of ocean-going merchant ships are quite magnificent, with libraries, swimming pools, cinemas, dance halls, billiard rooms, etc. From morning to night, guests can enjoy various pleasant entertainments. At present, passenger and commercial transport between China and the United States has not been officially restored. The "Meigu" is a transport ship. The cabins are divided into first class for American officers, first class for people from various countries, and first class for American soldiers. The ship still has a semi-military nature of management, so various facilities are of course lacking. The general guest life is characterized by boredom, dizziness, and sleepiness. In terms of food, it is called a buffet. Three meals a day, when the bell rings, all the guests line up in batches, file into the restaurant, hold their plates, and wait to be assigned food. They must return the plates to the designated place. Beef, mutton, pork, and a small amount of vegetables and fruits are distributed in rotation every day. All the meat is sweet and greasy. For the first three days, it was still delicious. After the fifth day, it was painful to eat. Holding the plate and feeling depressed, drinking coffee and feeling bored. Everyone asked each other: What is the first thing you will do when you get to San Francisco? The answer must be: Eating Chinese food is the first thing. There are also more than a hundred Jewish guests who eat many times a day. They do not eat in the restaurant, and they mutter words in their mouths when eating, still maintaining their unique customs. This stateless nation still has more than a thousand families living in a village outside the East Gate of Kaifeng in our country, and they have generally been assimilated by the Chinese. Many Chinese passengers are living their first ocean voyage. They feel seasick as soon as they get on the boat, and they are sleepy in the bunks. After meals, they often go to the bunks, take a novel, and study while sleepy. In the evenings, Chinese and foreign people gather in the restaurant to play Chinese chess, push dominoes, play mahjong, and play poker, until 12:00 midnight, when they reluctantly disperse. From 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM, Chinese friends also organize lectures, and there are solo performances by young ladies and Peking opera, etc. Everyone also prints a book called "Same Boat Record," showing a group of enthusiasm and harmony. The authentic style of Sichuan friends is to tell stories. Thus, morning and evening, the short twelve-day journey felt like it flew by. When the ship arrived in San Francisco, everyone felt very sad and reluctant to say goodbye to the "Meigu."</p>
<p>Preparations Before Going to the United States</p>
<p>Going abroad is not an easy thing. It is quite troublesome. In the future, when passenger transport between China and the United States is restored, the number of people going abroad will increase. Regarding the preparations before going to the United States, I will write out one by one the experiences I have gained this time, for readers to refer to: (1) Passport: Ordinary passports are applied for by various agencies, approved by various departments, and then issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Official passports must be approved by the National Government before they can be received. Diplomatic passports are for government diplomatic personnel and government special envoys. Holders of this passport enjoy exemption from inspection when passing through any port customs. After obtaining the passport for going abroad. You must complete the injection procedures at the Jianghai Customs Epidemic Prevention Office or a designated hospital, and obtain a yellow certificate from the Epidemic Prevention Office before you can buy a ticket from the shipping company. The more foreign exchange you bring to the United States, the better. If you bring too little foreign exchange, or less than 1,000 yuan, you must have a definite guarantee before you can go ashore. This is one thing that the US consulate must inquire about. (2) British and American habits are different. The British have gentlemanly manners. In restaurants and living rooms, they must dress neatly and respect their appearance. Americans are more rough and unrestrained, and they are more casual and natural. Their clothing is neat and polite. Therefore, when going abroad, you should bring pajamas, sleeping pants, toothbrushes, spittoons, slippers, and other things that the ship should have. Clothing should be determined according to the season, and it is best to bring less. (3) In terms of food, be sure to bring Sichuan pickled vegetables, Yunnan mustard tuber, and Chinese canned food that you want to buy. You should bring more Chinese tea. If you are tired of eating the food on the ship, you can eat a little mustard tuber or drink a cup of Chinese tea, which can greatly refresh your mind and nourish your energy. These preparations must be paid attention to. Residents of Huainan built small dikes to drain water in a primitive way (Photo by Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi)</p>

<h3>The Burden on Little Brains is Too Heavy</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>At this moment of rebuilding everything, education is the foundation for establishing a nation and cultivating talents, and elementary school education should be given special attention. Although the Ministry of Education has regulations regarding elementary school education, and experts are often invited to discuss it, there are still several aspects of elementary school education in Shanghai that do not meet the standards. Therefore, I feel compelled to speak out.</p>
<p>First, in Shanghai, perhaps due to environmental factors, English courses are added as early as the third grade of elementary school. In reality, these children are only seven years old. Their brains are simple and fragile. When taught foreign languages, they cannot grasp the meaning or comprehend. They only repeat what the teacher says, echoing the sounds. They do not understand the spelling of letters or the concept of singular and plural in grammar. The children, fearing punishment from the teacher, and urged on by their parents, spend a lot of time studying hard after class. The fragile brains are burdened too heavily. Why not explicitly correct this ineffective teaching method and postpone the start of English until the fifth grade, as is the case in municipal schools?</p>
<p>Second, teachers require elementary school students to copy books or new words in pencil after returning home from school. The daily amount can be as high as seven or eight hundred characters, and at least three or four hundred characters. Children, after school, have to prepare for calligraphy, diaries, or arithmetic exercises, and must also work at their desks, unable to engage in outdoor activities. Sometimes, they are not finished even at dusk, and must continue working after dinner, which affects their physical strength and eyesight, and cultivates a careless attitude. Is it easy to create a physically and mentally healthy citizenry in this way? Teachers intend to give students more training, but have they ever considered the negative consequences of this?</p>
<p>The above two points are based on my observations of four or five children in school in my family and those of friends, and after careful study, I believe there is a need for improvement. Therefore, I offer these humble opinions and ask your publication to publish them for the reference of elementary school education authorities.</p>

<p>The Rampant Gambling and Opium in Qibao Town</p>
<p>To the Editor: Qibao is an important town in western Shanghai, formerly located at the intersection of Shangsong and Qing counties. Currently, it is incorporated into the Shanghai urban area. The administration of Songyi has been taken over by the urban area, but the police force has not been extended due to insufficient allocation in the urban area. The Qingyi police have been withdrawn by order of superiors. The town is temporarily maintained by the town chief, but there are also district chiefs from the urban area, and the administration is not unified. Unscrupulous individuals are taking the opportunity to sell drugs. Although the Longhua sub-bureau has heard of this and often sends personnel to the town to investigate, the sellers are forewarned and escape. The gambling atmosphere is also terrible! Teahouses are disguised gambling dens. In this small town, there are fifteen teahouses, each with three or four mahjong tables, and a gambling table. This is what I have seen and heard, and no one cares! I hope the authorities will work with local agencies to thoroughly implement the joint liability method of the past! (Wang Dasheng)</p>
<h3>Reply by Mail</h3>
<p>Reply to Mr. Liu Guisheng: Your letter of the 28th was forwarded to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for investigation. We have now received a reply from Chairman Wang Fangong stating: "This matter has been handed over to the relevant authorities for thorough investigation. The results will be communicated separately. Please be informed accordingly."</p>
<p>Reply to Mr. Wang and Mr. Chen: The Social Affairs Bureau replied regarding the distribution of sugar, stating: "An investigation was conducted. According to the report, the Lao Tongsheng Nanhuo Store in Laoximen, Nanshi, distributed 30 bags of sugar in the ninth round, which were sold on the 14th, 15th, and 16th of this month, as recorded in the accounts. All remaining empty bags are stored in the store, and the inspection found no discrepancies. The accusation that the distributed sugar flowed into the black market cannot be substantiated." This is a special reply.</p>
<p>Reply to Mr. Sun Kezhi: The Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau replied that the property at a certain number in Baochangli has been found not to be enemy property. This is a special reply.</p>
<p>Reply to Mr. Hu Yongyuan: Letter received. Regarding the issue of unifying academic terms in the numerical naming method, if the term "yi" is used consistently instead of "wan wan" (ten thousand squared), there will be no ambiguity as you pointed out.</p>

<p>Hygiene and Medicine</p>
<h3>Talking About Personality</h3>
<p>— Xia Zhenyi</p>
<p>The Secret of Mental Hygiene</p>
<p>Among your relatives, friends, or siblings, you can often find two completely different personalities: one type is often taciturn, suspicious and sensitive, unsociable, and does not like sports or entertainment. He seems isolated from group life. He is constantly deep in thought, indulging in fantasies to find his only satisfaction. Sometimes, during the day, he abandons work to daydream, building many castles in the air. In public gatherings, he often stays alone, unwilling to participate in conversations and laughter. He feels shy and blushes in crowded places. He avoids opportunities to speak in public. Even if he memorizes his speech perfectly, he becomes embarrassed on stage and cannot say a word.</p>
<p>Introversion and Extroversion</p>
<p>The other type of personality is completely the opposite of the one described above. He is talkative and active, consistent in word and deed, eloquent, and sociable. He can speak confidently to the crowd. In public places, he easily mingles with strangers and quickly becomes acquainted. He is often a leader in groups and is an exhibitionist. However, his emotions are easily fluctuated. He is extremely excited when excited and extremely depressed when unhappy. The great psychologist C.C. Jung gave these two types of personalities two names: the former is called "Introverts," and the latter is called "Extroverts."</p>
<p>Because introverts are too narrow-minded, suspicious, and prone to worry, they can only make a few friends, and they are only casual acquaintances. They rarely have confidants. They feel even more awkward when interacting with the opposite sex because they cannot forget themselves. They are always aware of their gender. Whenever they meet a stranger, they like to know the person's background. If they find that this person's status or achievement is higher than theirs, it triggers a strong sense of inferiority. Therefore, they often avoid this person and reduce contact to maintain their feeling of being "superior." However, extroverts, because they can forget themselves and are sincere, can get along with everyone and develop close relationships. Because they are straightforward and not humble or pretentious, people are willing to associate with them and become close friends. If they encounter people of higher status, they will flatter them in every way. People who like to ingratiate themselves belong to this type of personality.</p>
<p>Personality and Occupation</p>
<p>The difference in personality is closely related to the choice of occupation. Many people fail because their occupations are not compatible with their personalities. Introverts prefer to work alone and cannot cooperate with others. Suitable occupations for them are writers, artists, tailors, bank accountants, clerks, librarians, or laboratory technicians. If an active "extrovert" takes on such a job, there will certainly be no good results. Extroverts, because they can cooperate with others and have ambition, decisiveness, and leadership desires, are most suitable to be lawyers, doctors, politicians, diplomats, salespeople, etc. If these jobs are given to introverts, it will not be easy to achieve good results.</p>
<p>As for the relationship between personality and nationality, it is a very interesting question. Although there are no concrete statistics to rely on, based on general observation: Eastern nationalities are more inclined towards introverted personalities; Western nationalities are more extroverted. This is not without reason. For thousands of years, our country has been influenced by Confucianism, "emphasizing literature and de-emphasizing military affairs," which is equivalent to emphasizing thought and de-emphasizing action. The precepts that guided children in the past, "There are golden houses in books, and there are beauties like jade in books," were nothing more than to make them "refined gentlemen" and "frail scholars," all of which encouraged introversion and hindered the development of extroversion.</p>
<p>The lives of Western nationalities are completely opposite to those of China. Their children develop a habit of being lively and adventurous from an early age, and spend most of their energy on things outside of themselves. Therefore, foreign children are more lively than the average Chinese child.</p>
<p>Indeed, extroversion and introversion only represent two extreme tendencies. You cannot clearly divide all of humanity into two categories: introverts and extroverts. The personality of the average person is between the two. He exhibits introversion in some things, but at the same time, he exhibits extroversion in others. Extreme introversion and extroversion are not the most suitable phenomena. Extremely extroverted personalities are bound to be reckless and careless people; extreme introverts, because they are too timid and weak, dare not face the difficulties of reality and retreat into fantasy. From the perspective of psychiatry, extreme introversion is a model of schizophrenia, and extreme extroversion is a precursor to mania.</p>
<p>The formation of our personality, in addition to being inherited from our parents, is more importantly influenced by the habits and environment we develop as children. There is a Chinese saying, "It is easier to change mountains and rivers than to alter one's nature." This statement is certainly correct, but it is not entirely true. We cannot change innate factors, but we can compensate for acquired factors. This leads to the responsibility of parents. If parents encounter children with extreme personalities, they should try their best to provide appropriate guidance so that they can gradually change and achieve appropriate improvements.</p>
<p>Several Rules</p>
<p>For children with extreme extroversion, pay attention to the following four points:</p>
<p>(1) Give the child plenty of work because he has plenty of energy and guide him to vent it in beneficial directions.</p>
<p>(2) Strengthen his body and give him various outdoor activities.</p>
<p>(3) Cultivate independence and a sense of responsibility, and cultivate the habit of finishing a task once it has been started.</p>
<p>(4) Help him control his emotions.</p>
<p>For children with extreme introversion, pay attention to:</p>
<p>(1) Fully exercise the body, interact with others, and eliminate the tendency to escape.</p>
<p>(2) Expand the scope of his interests.</p>
<p>(3) Encourage reasonable socialization.</p>
<p>(4) If there are problems, encourage him to fully and freely discuss them with his parents. Because this type of child often dwells on and fantasizes about certain difficulties, resulting in a psychology of suspicion and fear, and dares not boldly propose them for discussion. Such as issues like "sex," "the mysteries of life," and "death," parents should take the opportunity to raise and discuss them.</p>
<p>After analyzing your personality and discovering that you have extroverted or introverted qualities, do not have unfounded fears. Know that introverts and extroverts each have their place. Introverts are the providers of ideas and insights; extroverts are the implementers of ideas. Without these two types of people, the world would never have progressed to the atomic age of today. "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle." We are members of this "world battlefield." To cope with this ever-changing and complex modern society, and to succeed in all undertakings, there is only one secret: understand your personality.</p>
<h3>The Incubation Period of Mental Illness</h3>
<p>— Liu Yueci</p>
<p>Hygiene is Prevention of Disease</p>
<p>Mental illness, like other diseases, does not happen overnight. It also has a so-called "incubation period." However, the manifestations of its incubation period are not as obvious as those of ordinary diseases, so they are easily overlooked. This is probably due to the traditional emphasis on the body rather than the spirit, so people rush to seek medical treatment after having a fever for three days, hoping for a quick recovery. However, if a person's temperament suddenly becomes irritable, or if he is prone to worry and unhappiness, people think it is just a normal occurrence. In fact, a three-day fever, although seemingly serious, can indeed be cured with one injection and two medicines; psychological abnormality, although without vomiting or pain, and seemingly mild on the surface, can actually develop into a thorny and serious disease over time. First, people are generally reluctant to seek medical treatment; second, people's minds do not pay much attention to the fact that the mental aspect can also get sick. Therefore, there are many cases where chronic and subtle mental disorders gradually develop into severe mental illnesses. In other words, crazy people did not become crazy overnight, because their symptoms had been incubating for a period of time, but their manifestations were not noticed early enough and prevented.</p>
<p>Society is complex, the environment is stimulating, and people's desires are uniformly high. It is not easy to have desires satisfied, and if they cannot be achieved, it is difficult to avoid psychological烦恼 and conflicts. In this situation, no one can be sure who will not be stimulated and develop mental illness. Furthermore, mental illness cannot be prevented with a single injection. The only method is to constantly examine ourselves in daily life, take precautions, and avoid the madness from developing and becoming uncontrollable. Examining oneself and studying oneself, the object is not others, but oneself, which is the most convenient and hygienic thing to do. The General Epidemic Prevention Team is spraying delousing water for people in the countryside near Xuzhou.</p>
<p>Nameless Depression</p>
<p>A simple method of examining ourselves is to constantly study our own state of mind. In terms of spirit, if we are often anxious, worrying about everything that need not be worried about, or often suspicious, suspecting that everyone in the world is not to be trusted, and even suspecting that others are plotting to harm ourselves, and normally, when we see others happy, we always feel three or four points of inexplicable dissatisfaction, if we have this time, we must ask ourselves, whether our dissatisfaction has a significant reason, whether our worries have a significant object, whether the changes in our emotions have persistence, for example, when we lose our temper, whether it will pass immediately, or if it will never end, for example, if we watch a tragedy, we will cry for three days in a row, because everyone can always feel some changes in their psychology, if the examination shows that our behavior is different from others, that may be a psychological abnormality of varying degrees.</p>
<p>Some people often see things that others cannot see, such as animals or statues of gods, and some people often hear words that others cannot hear,历 their sins, and some people always have strange thoughts, often thinking that they are great men in the world. I remember that there was a patient who insisted that he was Marshal Ma, but he was actually an unemployed rickshaw puller, and some people were convinced that they were famous rich people, but their economic situation was actually abject poverty.</p>
<p>Excessive Suspicion</p>
<p>Sometimes we will make some useless and unnecessary actions. We know that we have already pasted the stamp on the envelope, but when we are about to throw the letter into the mailbox, we have to check it carefully again and again, pasting it again and again. There are indeed such people in the world who, when they put the letter into the envelope, are afraid of omissions, take it out and put it in, and carefully check it dozens of times, but the recipient still receives an empty envelope. Psychological abnormalities are diverse, strange and indescribable. If we do have the above-mentioned phenomena, then that is some kind of mental abnormality.</p>
<p>There are also some people who are called "neurotic" people. It seems that they have some kind of altered personality from heredity. Although the degree of alteration is different, the abnormal personality can be seen when they are not even teenagers. These people have a lot of intelligence 　and are particularly imaginative, but they have defects in emotion and will. Their emotions change very quickly, and their concepts of love and hate are not correct. Usually, they are always somewhat depressed. They lack patience, so they are prone to anger. When they are angry, they are extremely irritable, and they often feel regret afterwards. Although they are sometimes optimistic and even excessively happy, this time is extremely short. Their personalities mostly belong to "inwardness" (commonly known as narrow-mindedness), so they are extremely tolerant to themselves and very harsh to others. "Suspicion" is their characteristic, often unable to be at ease about a very small thing, or excessively worried about one thing and turning it into terror. They are prone to insomnia, often have nightmares, and sometimes have pessimistic and world-weary thoughts. If a person really reaches this point, then there is a risk of mental breakdown.</p>
<p>In short, there are many manifestations of the incubation period of mental illness, because we usually do not pay much attention to changes in emotions, so we ignore the danger of its incubation period. By the time madness breaks out, it is already serious and棘手. Therefore, the mental patients we see sent to the hospital for treatment are all those very noisy patients, and there are absolutely no preventive measures taken in advance. However, mental illness is not impossible to prevent, as long as we can patiently and constantly examine ourselves, prevent problems before they happen, and give initial treatment in the early stages, then it will not develop into a serious illness, so that even experts are helpless and regret is useless.</p>

<p>— Excerpt from "Infectious Disease Management" by Qiao Shumin</p>
<p>Foam Transmission - Respiratory diseases with symptoms of cough or sneeze are most easily transmitted to people through foam. However, foam transmission does not usually exceed a range of twelve feet. Furthermore, the size of the foam is clearly related to the amount of bacteria it contains. Larger foams can contain more bacteria, but also fall to the ground earlier; smaller foams have a longer range, but often contain fewer bacteria. According to an analysis of photos taken using high-speed photography by Mr. Jenning, each sneeze can eject an average of 20,000 foams into the air. The size of the foams varies. Among them, 80 percent have a diameter of less than 200 μm, and can float in the air, quickly evaporating into foam nuclei (Droplel-nuclei), drifting for hours or even days without falling; the bacteria they contain can also continue to live for noon days, and have the ability to transmit diseases. Generally, this type of foam transmission is quite common in places where the air is obstructed and densely crowded.</p>
<p>(II) Gastrointestinal Tract Transmission - Diseases transmitted through the gastrointestinal tract are very common in China. Unclean drinking water, food, and flies are the main media, often triggering epidemics. The epidemics can also have the following characteristics for identification.</p>
<p>1 Water Supply Transmission - Historically, there have been many records of epidemics transmitted through water supply, and there is no shortage of evidence that the epidemic was extinguished after water supply was controlled. In the past thirty years, European and American countries have paid great attention to water supply management, and have implemented centralized chlorine (or bleaching powder) disinfection of tap water. As a result, epidemics of gastrointestinal transmission have disappeared in Europe and the United States. Only in China, the cities with tap water before the war were only seventeen, and only seven of them implemented chlorine or bleaching powder disinfection. The countryside is even more out of the question. Therefore, gastrointestinal infectious diseases are prevalent everywhere, all year round. Cholera alone has been流行过 fifty-three times, and countless people have died from it—</p>
<p>In addition, raw and cold foods, ice products, swimming pools, etc., can all have the same transmission opportunities.</p>
<p>2 Milk Transmission - Milk is an excellent medium for culturing general bacteria. Therefore, in European and American countries that are accustomed to drinking milk, milk transmission is not limited to general gastrointestinal transmission. There are thousands of large and small epidemics of scarlet fever, diphtheria, tuberculosis, etc. Chinese people rarely drink milk, so it is not as serious as it is there.</p>
<p>3 Fly Transmission - Li and flies are thriving in summer and autumn. If feces and filth are not properly handled, flies will carry bacteria to food, resulting in the transmission of diseases, which is extremely common. The flies that transmit diseases are 99% houseflies (M.Domestica). This type of fly likes to gather on feces, filth, and food, especially foods containing sugar. Flies cannot digest protein or starch, and must vomit stomach acid to dissolve the sugar in the food, and then suck it in. The vomit can contain pathogenic bacteria. The infectivity of the bacteria contained in flies generally does not exceed forty-eight hours, and at most does not exceed five days. Sometimes flies can fly a distance of one thousand seven hundred bricks, but the bacteria they carry depend on the environment.</p>
<p>(III) Insect and Wound Transmission</p>
<p>1 Wound Transmission - Bacteria that invade wounds are either　gas　or　gas　属. The former are cocci, such as staphylococcus, of which streptococcus is important because it has a strong tendency to invade the blood stream from the lymphatic vessels; the latter is most important as tetanus bacillus.</p>
<p>2 Insect Transmission - Insect-transmitted bacteria are either刺入 through their beaks, or scratched or wiped in by human fingers, and sometimes enter through wounds. Generally, bacteria mostly originate from vertebrates; protists mostly originate from the insects themselves. Protists are quite different from bacteria, in that the former often have a "sexual reproductive history" as special. Parasites with the sexual reproductive stage are the final hosts, and parasites with the asexual reproductive stage are the intermediate hosts. Only after completing the sexual reproductive stage can they reach the asexual reproductive stage, and then they can be transmitted to the intermediate host. The time to complete the sexual reproductive stage is called the external incubation period, which is of no small importance to the management of infectious diseases. Infectious diseases with an external incubation period, the pathogenic microorganisms are mostly protists, but there are also filterable toxins.</p>
<p>The importance of the external incubation period can be said in two ways: first, the external incubation period can be regarded as a temporary safe period. If we discover the first case, then during this period, we can quickly extinguish insects to eliminate transmission? Secondly, the so-called external incubation period is the time when bacteria multiply and reproduce in the insect's body. This multiplication and reproduction must be subject to considerable restrictions from the external temperature, because insects are cold-blooded animals, and their body temperature rises and falls with the external climate. Not only the temperature is true, but also factors such as humidity, wind direction, and rainfall are not without relationship,详不</p>
<p>Now, assuming that a quantitative amount of bacteria (seeds) with infectivity and toxicity invades the human body (soil) through a suitable route (sowing), then whether an infectious disease occurs still depends on the fertility of the soil—the susceptibility or resistance of the human body—please discuss the soil.</p>

<h3>Wishes</h3>
<p>— Hua Lin</p>
<p>Wishes are like flying birds, crossing high mountains and raging seas, heading towards an infinitely distant future. Time forms the journey of history, but only wishes are forever ahead of history, displaying beautiful radiance!</p>
<p>Phidias, the solemn and sacred Athens, sculpts divine statues, incorporating the epitome of beauty of all the Greek men and women, adding his own patriotic zeal, adding his entire life, sculpting gods and sanctity, standing in the city of Athens, causing the youth of Greece to fall prostrate, with golden brilliance and dazzling colors. Even invading enemies crossing the sea would be frightened and bow before the divine statue!</p>
<p>Greek island—Greek island! Where are the Greek poets? Patriotic poems were transmitted the earliest! Byron and Goethe both worshipped Greece. The Greek religion transformed the nature of the universe into a beautiful life of grain and taught us to be intoxicated in the realm of nature. Gods do not leave people; gods are always very close to people. This beautiful illusion shrouds the ends of the sea and the edge of the land. "Wishes" forever fly forward without end!</p>
<p>This is poetic, this is scenery, this is the lingering sound of a song, lingering for three days!</p>
<p>Why, in the real world, have we lost our future, as if drifting on a boundless sea, losing direction in a daze, drifting with the waves, not knowing where we are going? Sicily, the island of hope, was invaded by Rome, and the Greeks were imprisoned. These prisoners, not slaves, all sang songs of freedom. The singing startled the seagulls on the beach, startled the eagles on the mountaintops, and together with the singing, they all flew up, moving the hearts of the Romans. They unlocked the shackles of the prisoners, and together they sang loudly. The song went straight into the sky. The Romans all said that they loved freedom, and we also love freedom; we are all one life!</p>
<p>A person who truly loves freedom also respects the freedom of others. If indeed the liberated zone has freedom, then what struggle can there be against the enemy? The Romans, in the song, joined hands with the Greeks, because in the rhythm of the melody, the blood is beating in the same way, and the breathing is equally passionate!</p>
<p>"Wishes" are in the endless future. It is like a flying bird, leaving traces of history on the edge of the world!</p>
<h3>On the Art of Dance</h3>
<p>— Shusun Ruying</p>
<p>The art of dance is rarely cultivated in China today. Mr. Wu Xiaobang and Ms. Dai Ailian, who recently performed in Shanghai, are two of the most accomplished people among these very few, and they have added some precious brilliance to China's barren art scene. However, a vast China with only two dance artists is pitifully too few. Not only that, but in our country of ancient civilization, how many people can understand dance, understand dance, and appreciate dance?</p>
<p>What kind of art is dance? A deep discussion may require writing a book, but here, I would only like to paint a silhouette of the art of dance with a few hundred words.</p>
<p>Dance is a comprehensive art. First, it is the synthesis of time art and space art: it is not like a painting that allows you to see everything at a glance, nor is it like poetry that only appeals to your spiritual vision. It occupies space and occupies time at the same time; it moves in space within time. Second, it is the synthesis of music, posture, and movement: almost all dances are accompanied by complex (such as symphonies) or simple (such as drums and cymbals) music, and in movement and posture, the melody, rhythm, and interest of the music are expressed. Third, it is the synthesis of various artistic elements: all artistic elements such as lines, colors, shapes, rhythms, melodies, and poetic intent are included.</p>
<p>Therefore, a dance artist must first have a rigorously trained body. This rigorous training enables his body to accept subtle control. Every muscle must be able to relax as much as possible and also be able to stiffen as much as possible. A dancer's legs and arms must be able to bend and stretch slowly and change speed with any changing music. They must be able to kneel, run, and jump; all movements of the human body must be controlled within the constraints of music. Secondly, the dancer must understand music so that he can integrate his dance with the music. So-called dance is tangible music, solidified music; therefore, people who do not understand music enough cannot achieve higher achievements in dance. Again, all art cannot be separated from life, and dance is no exception. Dancers must understand life and have a deep understanding of life. Only then will their dance have content and meaning. Only those who can express the true meaning of life with technically perfect dance are truly great artists.</p>
<p>Ancient dances, whether in the East or the West, have the same characteristics. Their main purpose is to express human life. In ancient times, there was a kind of war dance, which was used to express heroic themes. Around the eighteenth century, dance had declined to the point of being restricted to the boudoir, with only some fixed movements and postures, emphasizing splendor and elegance. Thus, dance became a lifeless temple art, a toy for the enjoyment of a few. The revival of modern dance began with Ms. Duncan. Although her life's romantic deeds have caused some misunderstandings among our people, who have not abandoned Puritanical thinking, her achievements in the art of dance are truly indelible. She accepted all the techniques of classical dance, but these classical techniques were liberated in her hands. She began to dance barefoot and to use music that was not dance music. She was the first to use body movement and posture to express the thoughts and emotions of a living person. Thus, modern dance was born, and the art of dance was revived.</p>
<p>In China, modern dance was introduced by Mr. Wu Xiaobang and Ms. Dai Ailian. They not only introduced Western and Japanese modern dance, but also worked hard to explore and create Chinese folk dance. Ms. Dai's advocacy of folk dance naturally has its significance. May their cultivation not be in vain, and may people in Shanghai understand what the art of dance is from now on.</p>
<h3>On Imitation</h3>
<p>— A Long</p>
<p>There seem to be quite a few people writing articles these days, which is very encouraging for the future of literature and art. However, after carefully reading newspapers and magazines, articles on plagiarism are often found. After a few days, rebuttal articles are published, and the literary world becomes very noisy. With the addition of cheering and shouting, it really becomes a full-scale martial arts performance.</p>
<p>And the result of this wonderful program is "no conclusion." The editor or a third party will write an article to mediate, and the way to mediate is not to say plagiarism, nor is it completely original, but only to be a little influenced, an imitation in style.</p>
<p>I quite agree with this view. I remember a few years ago, someone shouted the slogan "We need to accept literary heritage." This means that we absorb the essence of the ancients, and then we can create better works.</p>
<p>People are not born omnipotent. At first, they need to be supported by others, and they should learn and imitate the necessary actions in their own lives until they can use them freely and make a living on their own. And literature is the same, but we should not imitate rigidly, we should not plagiarize indiscriminately, and piecemeal plagiarism will lose its meaning.</p>
<p>Sholokhov's "Quiet Flows the Don" was influenced by Tolstoy; although Shaw's "The Adventures of the Black Girl in Her Search for God" has several places that imitate Voltaire, this is only imitating style and does not affect the overall value of the work.</p>
<p>As for some works that obviously adopt the plots of famous works, or even plagiarize the personalities created by others, this kind of internal imitation is like the work losing its soul. Things without a soul will naturally not contribute anything. Although we cannot definitively assume that the author used a certain popular famous work as a blueprint, this is always a flaw.</p>
<p>Here, I want to advise those who plagiarize: you should read more and experience more. In this way, unconsciously, you will get the valuable parts of those books and real life and melt them down. Afterwards, not only will it be easy to write, but the work will also be more successful.</p>
<h3>On the Decadent School in Art — Tolstoy's Theory of Art</h3>
<p>— Liu Xianya</p>
<p>Art is impoverished in content because of the unbelief of the upper classes, and because it is becoming more and more special, it is becoming more and more complex, more incomprehensible, and more particular about appearances. Therefore, similar works of art are only for a small number of classes in special states, or only for the author and his followers—kings, dukes, princesses, etc. Such works of art do not express what is understood by the public, but only seek to be understood by those who are accustomed to ridicule. First, in this way, one can say more; second, this method of expression feels vaguely special and beautiful in the special class. This method is gradually used, and in the end, it becomes decadent art.</p>
<p>In decadent art, ambiguity often overflows in the works of art, so many poets commonly abide by this theorem. And there are many artists who, according to Nietzsche and Wagner, believe that what they do should not be understood by the foolish public, but should arouse the poetic state of educated people; this kind of person is called by British aestheticians—the best nurtured men.</p>
<p>At that time, the most respected among the decadents were Baudelaire and Verlaine. In their poems and prose works, we simply cannot understand their meaning. Now, let us copy Baudelaire's "The Stranger" as follows:</p>
<p>"Stranger, whom do you love? Your father, your mother, your brother, your sister?</p>
<p>I have no parents, no brothers or sisters. Your friends?</p>
<p>You use words whose meaning I still do not know. Your country?</p>
<p>I do not know in what latitude it is. Beauty?</p>
<p>If she were a goddess and immortal, I would be very willing to love her. Gold?</p>
<p>I hate him as you hate God. Alas! Strange stranger, what do you love?</p>
<p>I love the clouds... the passing clouds, the wonderful clouds..." What does this "stranger" mean? What is it all about? It really makes us completely incomprehensible. Therefore, we feel why so many artists in the decadent school respect Baudelaire and Verlaine.</p>
<p>As for Baudelaire's outlook on life, it is based on the crude "egoism" as a theory, replacing morality with the uncertain meaning of "beauty" and "the beauty of art." Baudelaire valued the made-up face of a woman more than the woman's original face, and valued iron trees and artificial mountains and rivers on the stage more than natural things.</p>
<p>Verlaine's outlook on life lies in withering dissolution, in acknowledging one's moral weakness, and in worshiping Catholicism to save its weakness.</p>
<p>They both lack truth, sincerity, and simplicity, and are full of hypocrisy, eccentricity, and self-esteem. But their theories still arouse the praise of many artists. What is the reason for this? Tolstoy said: To explain this phenomenon, one only needs one sentence: "The art that these poets' society needs is not a legitimate and important thing in life, but only a game."</p>
<p>In summary: good, great, universal art is not understood by only a small part of the bad class, but never by the majority of simple and clean working people. The reason why art makes the majority of people unable to understand it is because it is good. At the same time, it can also be said that the reason why art makes the majority unable to understand it is because it is not good, or it is simply not art.</p>
<p>Therefore, we know that the art of the decadent school is the "egoistic" and "incomprehensible" art; that is, what Tolstoy said is "not good" or even "simply not art." This question can also be expanded to the scope of popular art to discuss the problem of unpopular art.</p>

<h3>An Inch of Territory, an Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"You are...?" A young waiter, wearing a cyan-blue cloth gown, came up to greet him. The hazy, clear light still reflected a deep red number "5" on his lapel, with four characters arranged in a neat semicircle above it, the larger ones being "XX Restaurant."</p>
<p>"Excuse me... It's too late, isn't it?" the man said with a smile.</p>
<p>"...There's still a small room on the sixth floor. Is that okay with you?"</p>
<p>"Good... There are only six floors here, aren't there? ...The higher, the better."</p>
<p>"Please, this way." the young man said, stepping aside and leading the way.</p>
<p>——The secret hand gestures and code words come to an end here.——</p>
<p>This building was originally a first-class hotel in Beiping. Since the counter-espionage work reached the expansion stage, this place became the North District Action Headquarters. The person in charge of the hotel was originally a strong revolutionary before, and the hotel was a superb cover for hiding dragons and crouching tigers, so setting up a headquarters here was quite appropriate. The ground floor to the fifth floor is still the ordinary hotel business. The entire sixth floor is the real place to issue orders, but it is arranged without a trace.</p>
<p>When I arrived on the sixth floor, I met Mr. W, the person in charge of the headquarters. At first glance, you can tell that he is an extremely capable, forthright, and extremely alert person.</p>
<p>"Welcome, welcome... On behalf of our bureau's highest person in charge and executive director, welcome, sir." His Mandarin had a heavy southern accent.</p>
<p>I also said a few polite words on behalf of Tsurumi; at the same time, I briefly explained the various troubles and dangers along the way from Changxin.</p>
<p>"What stage has the 'Seven Secret Keys' reached now?" Mr. W went straight to the point.</p>
<p>"The first plan is to decipher the contents, and then think of a way."</p>
<p>"Are you confident?"</p>
<p>"I'll try, but the risk is very high." I thought of the scene of Tsurumi's hasty departure.</p>
<p>"Da has made sufficient arrangements, right?"</p>
<p>"Of course, but the other side's arrangements are also very strict!"</p>
<p>"Mr. K..." Mr. W was considering how to ask; he was eager to know Da's background.</p>
<p>"Yes, a descendant of one of the active members of the Huanghuagang Uprising."</p>
<p>"Ah?" He looked at the watch on his wrist; "No wonder... So... "expressed surprise.</p>
<p>"There is no doubt about it... But the gentleman is the third person to know about this!" I very solemnly explained this key point.</p>
<p>"How did he himself confirm it?" He picked up the direct line telephone, "Sorry, it's getting late, we still have to meet Ms. Ji, don't we?" He said to me, "...Hello,...Prepare two cars, the second one fifty yards away." After putting down the phone, Mr. W pressed the first of a row of six wires.</p>
<p>"His father is Gu Yongchang," I continued to explain Tsurumi's background; "It can probably be found on the old Tongmenghui membership list. After the Huanghuagang Uprising, his parents both took refuge in Japan, living in the Nagasaki settlement. Less than a month later, a child was born. That is Gu Jun. At the same time, his mother passed away due to postpartum fatigue..."</p>
<p>At this moment, someone knocked lightly on the door twice. Without waiting for a reply of "Come in," the door was already open. A young man, wearing a very neat uniform, walked into the room and closed the door behind him; he saluted Mr. W.</p>
<p>"Please assign four comrades on rotation to the second car, maintaining a fifty-yard distance for alert." After Mr. W finished speaking, he raised his hand. The young man responded with "Yes," saluted, and turned to leave. His attitude was very solemn. From this point, I saw the good omen of China's rebirth.</p>

<h3>The Sugar Line</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Osmanthus fragrance drifts, the autumn wind is easy, although the tail of the autumn tiger is strong, people's mood is after all heading towards freshness. Pleasant weather, harvest season, Shanghai is a city where consumption and production compete most fiercely. Eating, drinking, and having fun, thinking of ways to scam a ticket, all have to be prepared spiritually.</p>
<p>Every festival makes one think of sugar, regardless of whether it is Chinese or foreign. The reason is probably because sugar is sweet, and sweetness belongs to happiness. Mid-Autumn Festival requires a lot of mooncakes, which use a lot of sugar, so the meaning of the sugar festival is especially strong. Unfortunately, there are no stalls selling Liangxiang Kui chestnuts on the road yet. Obstacles to north-south transportation make us lack this good fruit to embellish the festival. It is really disappointing! And fried chestnuts are also a kind of food that needs sugar.</p>
<p>At this, we suddenly realize the seriousness of the recent sugar dispute and the reason why creditors are competing for sugar!</p>
<p>In front of every southern goods store, there are crowds of people reaching out and shouting, sometimes forming a line that extends for two or three kilometers. But the characters in this scene, what is expressed on their faces is not sweetness, but bitterness, not joy, but irritability. Yes, bitterness is pursuing sweetness, and irritability is pursuing joy!</p>
<p>Most of Shanghai's sugar comes from Taiwan. Until today, we are still eating the sugar that Taiwan stored in the past, which contains countless blood stains, but this is beyond the imagination of sugar eaters. It is said that most of the sugarcane fields in Taiwan are abandoned, and the yield next year will be quite problematic. In this case, the sugar line may have to be extended to Taiwan next year. Can everyone get a pound? It's hard to say.</p>
<p>Some people say, don't panic, Cuban sugar will come.</p>
<p>Life Sketches</p>
<h3>One of the Seven Necessities: Buying Rationed Sugar</h3>
<p>— Xin Qi</p>
<p>One evening, the neighbor, Mrs. X, came over to sit and chat. She said: "Mrs. X, there is rationed sugar for sale in the southern goods store today, 860 yuan per catty. The goods are exactly the same as the car sugar sold by the American goods peddlers on the road, and they are much cleaner than the white sugar sold in the southern goods store on weekdays. It is said that it will be rationed once every two weeks..." My younger siblings were all overjoyed to hear this.</p>
<p>A few days later, the news of the eighth and ninth periods of rationed sugar was indeed published in the newspaper: the retail price was 820 yuan per catty, and each person was limited to three catties, which was 40 yuan cheaper than what Mrs. X said that day.</p>
<p>At 1:00 p.m. on the 14th, I went to a southern goods store nearby to buy rationed sugar. I saw that there were already about 200 people lined up in a long snake formation. Thinking that there would definitely be no hope for me to buy it today, I immediately turned back home and told my mother: "It's too crowded today! Let's wait until tomorrow to buy it?"</p>
<p>The next day, I came home from work at exactly 12 o'clock. I said to my mother, "Leave me some rice so I can go buy sugar and come back to eat." As soon as I walked over, I saw that there were already seventy or eighty people in line! For this sugar that costs 820 yuan per catty, it is really cheap, so I lined up in order. There were suddenly a hundred or so people behind me.</p>
<p>The rationing time arrived. Those standing next to the counter at the front shouted, "Why don't you sell it when the time is up?" At first, the shop assistants replied, "Wait a moment." Later, after shouting too much, the shop assistants ignored them and did other business, some comfortably raising their heads and shaking their fans.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, it was 1:30, and sales still hadn't started! There was a clamor at the front, and those standing at the back were also making sounds of discontent. It was easy to hear a loud shout, "Everyone, stand in line and don't squeeze, sales are starting." So everyone was chest to back, back to chest, tightly pressed together like abacus beads. Everyone's chest and back were wet.</p>
<p>"Three catties, three catties..." Two or three shop assistants were busy: counting banknotes, giving change, weighing sugar, wrapping it up... Half an hour passed, and only twenty or thirty people had left. It would take an hour to get to me. At this time, I saw my younger siblings running over, "Brother X, mother told you not to buy it if you can't, go home and eat, because you have to go to work in three hours." But I had already been standing for two hours. Although it was stipulated that sales would stop at 3:00, there was still hope of buying it. It would be a pity to leave like this. So I said to my younger siblings, "Then you stand for me and bring back three catties."</p>
<p>In the evening, when I came home from work, the younger siblings said with a distressed look, "Brother X, we stood until 3 o'clock, and there were only seven or eight people left in front; who knew that the shop assistants said, 'Time is up, we'll sell it tomorrow.'"</p>
<p>The third day, I was sitting in the office thinking to myself, "I don't have much official business today, so I can speed up and finish it in a little over an hour; I might as well leave work early and take a half-day off in the afternoon to wait to buy sugar. Otherwise, tomorrow, the last day, the situation of buying sugar will definitely be more difficult." After making a plan, I left work early.</p>
<p>When I came home, my mother asked in surprise, "Why are you so early...?" I didn't wait for her to finish speaking and continued, "For buying sugar!" Looking at the watch, it was still a quarter of eleven, so I went to the southern goods store. Ah! There were even more people with better patience than me, and there were already more than ten people waiting.</p>
<p>Three hours of sunbathing was indeed a bit difficult to bear, but I finally walked home holding a bag of three catties of rationed sugar.</p>
<h3>Park</h3>
<p>— Changpu</p>
<p>Although the season has entered autumn, the climate has still lingered around ninety degrees Fahrenheit for the past week. After dinner, because Shanghai's houses are crowded and there is no place to cool off, I wanted to stroll to the park, hoping to relieve the day's hard work.</p>
<p>After buying a ticket, I entered XX Park, which greatly disappointed me. The weeds in the park were ankle-deep, the horizontal bars of the deck chairs were falling off, and most of the green grass on the lawn was gone, revealing mottled patches of mud. I only saw many children with bare chests and no shoes kicking football on the lawn, so I knew the reason why there was no green grass on the lawn. Along the road, next to the trees, and next to the fences, many children were holding earthenware jars to catch crickets, which caused many of the neat bricks laid on the ground to turn over, the roots of the trees were exposed outside the mud, and the fences were broken. I walked to the flower bed and took a look. There were flowers, but they were actually a few wild dandelions and wild chrysanthemums decorating it. The swings and seesaws in the children's park were also just empty frames. There were originally many flowers and trees in the botanical garden, but now they are poorly pruned, so most of them have withered and are unbearable. When the wind rises, the mud and sand on the lawn without grass all fly up, so the park is covered with mud and sand, and people cannot be seen across the street, which scares me and I hurriedly escape.</p>
<p>I remember that the parks in Shanghai before the war were still quite well-maintained. Why are they so barren after the victory? Shanghai only has a few small parks. If they are allowed to become barren and not repaired, then Shanghai will become a metropolis without parks, which is a miracle in the world!</p>
<h3>Low Profile</h3>
<p>— San Gong</p>
<p>Zhou Qi was formally reported for suing the Mass Nightly News. Yesterday, it was also reported that Chen Yonghui, who once served as a puppet official, was detained in the Zhongzi Prison for extorting money from Westerners. These two "clever people" can be said to have "lifted a rock only to drop it on their own feet." As the saying goes, "Cleverness may be defeated by its own ingenuity." Having made a mistake in the past, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no mistake today. Is it really "one mistake after another"?</p>
<p>Recently, disputes have occurred one after another on trams. It is, of course, necessary to rectify the military discipline when soldiers beat conductors, but the poor attitude of some conductors towards passengers also seems to need improvement.</p>
<p>The "Miss" who bravely came forward has seemingly forgotten that her father is in prison. Therefore, some people say that this is in line with a traditional Chinese spirit—"placing righteousness above family ties."</p>
<p>Trams seem to be the exclusive property of passengers at the starting and ending points, because some of the stations in between are not stopped even though they are set up, and some are too crowded to board even when they stop. Is this what is called "seeing something through from beginning to end"?</p>
<h3>We Cherish Military Discipline</h3>
<p>— Chong Zhen</p>
<p>Starting from the Beating of a Tram Conductor</p>
<p>We cannot remain silent when naval soldiers, in order to get the tram to stop before reaching the station, resorted to beating the conductor when their goal was not achieved. Moreover, they privately arrested the conductor, dragged him into the camp, and beat him severely, leaving Liang Guanghui on the verge of death. What kind of system is this?</p>
<p>We believe that the offending soldiers who have received training are underestimating discipline too much. "Military discipline is the lifeblood of the army." This is the true color of a soldier. Have they forgotten their true color as a result of training? Moreover, everyone knows that trams must stop at stations. Do they not even know this? We remember the achievements of the Navy in the War of Resistance Against Japan, and we look forward to the establishment of a new Navy, but this incident has severely affected the general respect and hope for the Navy. Although, the vast majority of naval personnel would not want the tram to stop before reaching the station and then resort to violence. It is somewhat comforting that Battalion Commander Ye Baoqi of the Navy regards military discipline as paramount and has firmly stated that the perpetrators, Zheng Fulin and others, have already been detained and will be handed over to the military court for trial. If the injured person dies as a result, the perpetrators will be executed. We believe that these words will definitely be fulfilled. Because the punishment of the perpetrators is not a kind of revenge, but a protection of the Navy's military discipline. We cherish the Navy. That is why we say this.</p>
<h3>There is an Answer</h3>
<p>— Ting</p>
<p>Due to the tram conductor beating incident, I was reminded of something: Once, I ran to the Shanghai office of the × Army, because I wanted to submit my name card directly to the reception room (in fact, I had been there several times, always to the reception room), without greeting the guard first, so a guard relentlessly asked me, "Have you received any education?"</p>
<p>I did not answer at the time, but unexpectedly, someone has now volunteered to answer this question.</p>

<h3>Atomic Mooncakes</h3>
<p>— Wen Yi</p>
<p>The Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, and mooncakes are coming into season.</p>
<p>Yesterday, as I passed Sichuan Road, I saw a large advertisement posted at the entrance of a food store, with the words "Atomic Mooncakes" prominently written on it, along with phrases such as "sweet and delicious" and "thin crust, ample filling."</p>
<p>The United States invented the "atomic bomb," and we will also invent "atomic mooncakes." Everyone knows the power of the "atomic bomb," but the "atomic mooncake" is sweet and delicious. This is the mystery of the atom.</p>
<p>We are now in the "Atomic Era" and the "Glass World." Since atomic mooncakes have already been invented, we hope that "glass mooncakes" will also be available on the market.</p>

<h3>Admission Exam Miscellany</h3>
<p>— A Person Who Has Been Through It</p>
<p>Having participated in the entrance examinations of Jiaotong University and Jinan University, I cannot help but write something down. I will write down what I think of below, regardless of order, and I ask the reader to forgive me.</p>
<p>The science subjects at Jiaotong University have always been difficult, but this year they were very easy. English, Chinese, history, and geography go without saying. But mathematics was really too difficult! Many people were fooled by the ease of the science questions on the first day, thinking that mathematics would not be very difficult, but the result was a big surprise. Many people left blank papers, and there must be many who got zero points even though they were able to do some of the problems.</p>
<p>Outside the examination hall, someone said, "The admission standards for the Jiaotong University entrance examination are getting lower every year." Someone else said, "Although there are many candidates this year, the admission standards will definitely not be raised, because the general scores are not very good." Whether or not this is accurate remains to be seen.</p>
<p>The Zhi Xing Service Department of Jiaotong University has made great contributions. When I took the Jinan University exam at Aurora University, when you were so thirsty that you had no choice but to buy fresh orange juice from the gatekeeper, thinking of the water supply at Zhi Xing, it was truly immeasurable merit!</p>
<p>One of the physics questions at Jinan University was to differentiate "which is a magnet and which is not a magnet" without using any iron tools. But the exam paper copyist wrote the word "which" as "ripe." At first, I thought I had to differentiate "which is a ripe magnet and which is not a ripe magnet." I couldn't help but secretly be startled.</p>
<p>Jinan University's mathematics was much easier than Jiaotong University's. There were a total of four questions (Jiaotong University had six). Two were on analytic geometry, one was on plane geometry, and one was on advanced algebra. But there are two things that can be discussed here: (I am fortunate enough to be able to solve them, so the following is not a complaint):</p>
<p>According to the admission brochure, the mathematics section for the College of Science only tests advanced algebra, analytic geometry, and trigonometry. Why wasn't trigonometry tested, but plane geometry was tested instead? As a result, many people—almost everyone—were not prepared. But then again, the questions were very easy. Anyone who had studied the three-sided plane geometry in junior high school should have been able to do it.</p>
<p>After the mathematics exam, the sports field was filled with voices of resentment. One student angrily said, "The person who set the questions is truly lacking in virtue!"</p>
<p>Someone said with emotion, "The questions at Jiaotong University were really satisfying. It would be worth it even to get zero points. The questions at Jinan University were neither painful nor itchy. You can do them, but you can't do them well."</p>
<p>University admission guides are almost in everyone's hands. The most common one is the thick book compiled by Yu Cheng. Almost no one brought textbooks. Students have also learned to speculate, only choosing shortcuts and not following the proper path. Is the trend of our country's education towards excellence or bankruptcy?</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, there are not the most students in Shanghai. For example, at this Jinan University exam, I saw many familiar faces who had also taken the Jiaotong University exam. I have a classmate who has already taken the exams for Southwest Associated University, Xiamen University, and Jiaotong University. He told me that many of his classmates have agreed to take the exams for Wuhan University, National Central University, Tangshan Jiaotong University, and Zhejiang University together. These ten or so people alone already require careful embellishment of their many 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　how can the number be a joyful celebration</p>
