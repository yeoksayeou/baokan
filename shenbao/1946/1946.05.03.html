<h3>吾人企求和平殷切　安全為當務之急　郭泰祺廣播對安理會期望</h3>
<p>〔美新聞處紐約一日電〕聯合國安全理事會中國永久代表郭泰祺（見圖）博士，頃向中國國內作無綫電廣播，大意如下：　余得與中國國內同胞暢談聯合國安全理事會工作经過，至感欣慰。過去數月中，安理會主席一職，係由中國擔任，今余主席任期已吿届滿，余獲此機會向君等報吿余個人對，对安全理事會之希望，實快　無似。</p>
<h3>仰賴集體和平保障國家安全</h3>
<p>諸君均知在安理會提出之若干問題，無法立予解決，其原因乃此等問題係於有關雙方無法覓求直接解決辦法以後，始提交安理會。同時，此等問題之性質，均足危及國際之和平與安全，換言之，安理會之主要工作，厥爲預防任何國際局勢或糾紛威脅吾人均欲維護之和平與安全。人類憧憬和平及渴求安全，防避危險，自非於戰事吿終後始吿開始，然待至最近戰爭結束，世上各國始恍然世界和平之先決條件，爲認識和平與安全之不可分性。世人茲已覺悟，任何可以劃分之和平，係一似是而非之和平，且不能　　久　。人類經歷痛苦之經騐，始獲此敎訓，難怪今日不論大小國家，莫不仰賴集體和平，以保障彼等之安全，安理會則係依此種覺悟與信仰而建立。自籌備委員會在倫敦召開會議以迄今日，專家委員會則孜孜不倦，訂定及修正程序規則，吾人深盼此一委員會之工作，不久可吿完成。其時安理會進行討論，將有一比較完密之議事規則，可資遵循。</p>
<h3>吾人目前難題如何提高威信</h3>
<p>吾目前之難題，乃如何加强安理會之權力及提高其威信，蓋吾人所需者，非一辯論質難之議會，允非一宣傳之講壇，而爲一擁有保障世界和平與安全所需之威信與權力之機構。諸君均熟知，在安理會之下，有一五强軍事參謀委員會，此一委員會同時亦在紐的召開會議，我國代表係國府參軍長商震將軍，中國代表團包括吾人之陸軍指揮官孫立人中將，毛邦初空軍少將曁我國海陸空部隊專家不下廿名。軍事參謀委員會歷次會議向不予公開，且純係討論具體軍事問題，中國爲安理會五永久會員之一，吾人對安理會永久會籍之印象，乃此種永久會籍非一特權，而係一特殊責任。</p>
<h3>世界和平安全端賴五強合作</h3>
<p>今日世界之和平與安全端賴五大强國之携手合作，吾則必無和平與安全可言，倘五强不能團結一致，安理會勢將失去效能，最後，余欲略敘數語，說明中國對安理會之態度與政策，吾等中國人民，深信憲章所含原朋與我民國建國原則，不謀而合，職是之故，吾人參加理事會任何討論之時，悉係以憲章之精神爲依歸。中國曾抗戰十三年，吾人企求和平之念，較任何他國爲股，同時我國國防實力未臻充實，雖吾人國境與海岸綫之漫長，在世界首屈一指，然吾人缺乏充分之海陸空防禦力量，安全實爲吾人當務之急，芷因吾人對國家安全之願望，與全球其他國家對國際安全之願望互相吻合，故吾人對安理會乃寄予最熱烈之希望，同時，吾人決竭力合作，促安理會之權力與威信與日俱增。</p>

<h3>實施薩凡奇計劃已與美國公司訂立合同　長江三峽工程即將開始</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕行政院工程計畫團，頃已與美國馬立森克努生公司訂立合同，實施長江三峽工程之薩凡奇計劃。聞該公司不久將派工程師來華，進行壩基鑽探工程，將來擬在宜昌附近，築一大規模之攔水壩。其主要功用：（一）防止三峽攤險，使滬渝大輪，可以直航。（二）利用長江水力發電，供應工業需要。（三）灌漑農田，促進水利。</p>
<h3>塘沽海港計劃建議早日完成</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕行政院工程計劃團港埠組總工程師杜德等一行，視察塘沽海港，業已公畢返滬，幷擬具報吿，建議侯團長，早日完成築港計劃，以應華北開發需要。該報吿略稱：塘沽海港，係於一九四一年，日本侵佔期內開始興築，截止日本投降前止，重要部分，尙未完成。按日本原定計劃，擬在該港入口深水道之兩旁，興築防浪堤，伸入海中約七·五英里，以保護此深水道，而使吃水二十五呎深之大輪，可以自由出入。該港築成後，在經濟上之價値，據日人估訂，最初每年即可吸收二百萬噸之貨物進口，倘將碼頭及上下貨設備改進，則進口貨品可再增加一倍，最後希望能將該港改良至八百萬噸貨品進口之容量。目前如重新計劃建築該港，在未充分圓滿達成以前，尙不敢存此奢望。此次余等奉派前往視察，深覺該港有積極興築之必要。該港位於東南富庶之區，扼平津門戶，地處重要，山西河北等省煤藏，將來均可由此出口，且築港費用，遠不如戰前海輪進口，繞過大沽口沙灘所遭遇損失之鉅。就目前情形估計，全部築港費用約需二千三百五十萬美金，三年可以築成，在建設期間海輪尙可自由出入，運輸不致停頓，此外總工程師杜德幷希望該項工程，能委託美國馬立森克努生公司承築，短期內即可籌劃興工。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>第三者不能糊塗！</h3>
<p>「政治協商會議」，旣然稱爲「協商」，一定是幾方面的，至少是兩方面的。協商旣早有成果，則凡參加協商的各方面，都該拿出萬分誠意來履行。如果眞能大家履行「政協」的協議事項，履行停戰命令，履行軍隊的整編統編方案，何以會有東北的衝突？何以會有長春之戰？更何以會有周恩來氏所說的「中原衝突擴大」？一針見血的話，必有一方或雙方沒有履行這些協議的辦法。那末，講公道的，希望調處的，就得認眞硏討不履行的是那一方面，是那些人？這一點弄明白，纔可判斷是非曲直，纔可確定那一方面是破壞和平。這是論事的常識。俗語說，「旁觀者淸。」我們老百姓，本來是國家的主人，今雖退處第三方面的旁觀者，也必須做一個淸明的觀察者，而決不能以糊塗的第三者自居。</p>
<p>可是從共軍圍攻長春以來，一直到佔長春，據哈市，破壞北寗鐵路，阻擾平瀋通車，我們只聽得一部分人在呼籲調處，一部分人在嚷着大家莫再打，但對誰在挑釁，誰先動手，大家儘管肚裏明白，却未嘗直捷指摘，這便是中共所以肆意叛亂的原因。調處執行部，成立以來，有勞盟邦將士的辛苦奔走，也從來沒有切實制止過中共破壞停戰協定的舉動；這更其使中共得意忘形，爲所欲爲。總之，第三者越裝聾做啞的糊塗起來，中共的破壞協議也就愈無顧忌。</p>
<p>現在我們應該醒醒了！負有調人任務的馬歇爾特使，在離渝的前夕，對中共提出意見如下：「此時應先將長春共軍撤退，交還中央軍隊接防，以後再談其他問題。」這眞簡單極了，爽快極了，也明白極了！東北原本不在軍事調處之內，而中央承認調處，只須不妨礙國軍接收行政主權的工作，已經可算仁至義盡，共軍發動圍攻長春，顯然是背約失信，破壞協議。第三者講調處，講是非，如果對這樣顯明而又重大的違反協議的行動，不加料正，糊糊塗塗的遷就現實，只望敷衍了事，其結果必致這裏糊好裂縫，那裏又將破損。今天的事，很簡單，就得使違背協議的人受到中外的唾棄，使他們明白違背協議並沒有好處，使他們明白必得照着協議重行做起，這纔可望國家大局眞能和平。馬歇爾特使離渝前夕的意見，是對中共的起碼要求！</p>
<p>請大家看看，中共不但在東北硬佔了長春哈爾濱，並且在關內各地也先後發動攻勢。蘇北情勢的緊張，南通四郊的突襲，山東各綫鐵路搶修工程的全停，聊城兗州高密濰縣一帶的遭受共軍襲擊，甚至北平天津近郊也都有零星的奇襲騷擾，這都可以窺見共黨最近是在如何破壞停戰命令，如何推翻「政協」的協議。恰在此時，共黨發言人又在延安散播謠言，乃至不惜設立怪電台，假冒南京昆明電台的廣播，淆亂人心，並且由周恩來氏故意聲稱中原衝突擴大，揑造了許多湘鄂方面共軍已受國軍圍擊的報吿，更可證明時至今日，中共全面叛變的準備殆將成熟。拆穿說：今天不要和平，而想用武力奪取政權，或至少用武力割據地方的，就是中國共產黨。我們老百姓，縱使退處於第三者，對此也決不能袖手旁觀，更不容許糊糊塗塗的只以呼籲和平了事。須知今天的中國，不是民國十三年齊　戰爭時代的上海。我們八年抗戰，　了無量的血，流了無量的汗，我們一定要保持這戰果。誰來破壞這戰果的，誰就是全國人民的公敵！</p>
<p>「協商」是雙方的，是多方面參與的。今天協商會議的協議案，已被共黨撕毁無遺了，難道參加協商諸公還無所聞見？國民大會五月五日召集的協議，爲共黨的不提名單而延期了。國民政府的擴大改組，也爲共黨不提國府委員名單和强爭名額而無形擱置了。制定憲法的重大任務，也爲了國民大會的延期而被迫躭誤了。軍隊的整編統編，更因爲共黨至今並未提出其縮編部隊的番號而無形延擱了。東北的行政主權，協議原由國民政府負責接收，中共不得妨碍，現在更由於共軍的侵佔長春而受到阻撓了。各地軍事衝突的停止，早已頒有命令，而兩閱月來，由於中共的東撞西闖，依然到處攻擊國軍，和平希望不絕如縷了。總之，一切一切，中共口頭講和平，實際在打仗。可是只許它打人，不許人回手！中共要打人家，必先喊人家要打它；中共正在打人家，必拒絕調處；中共打好了，奪佔了地盤，必大喊停戰，使人家不好再打。等它休息若干時日，力量整理好，可以再打了，然後再先喊人家要打它　以便重演一回全武行的拿手好戲。如此這般，便是中共的如意法寳，而今天中國愛好和平的人民與善意調處的盟友，就在中共這套法寳把戲的欺騙之中。我們現在要大聲疾呼：第三者果眞要永久和平，須得淸醒起來，不能再裝糊塗，更不能再受中共的欺騙！</p>

<h3>外長會議入第二週　致力於和約討論　美蘇之間不斷發生異見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦二日廣播：四强外長今日又發生新「異議」，但因禍得福，由於「異議」之層出不窮，現已發現簡單化之討論程序，對於未來談判，將予以不少便利。今日之異議，係關於義大利戰俘之管理問題，莫洛託夫照例反對美方建議後，法外長立即起立發言稱：「外長會議自開會後，迄未成立協議，而異議則層出不窮，此後應改良討論方式，正式會議應改爲非正式會談，每日舉行一次，第一次會議定今日在英外相辦公室舉行。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎二日電〕四國外長今日加緊努力，就對義和的，覓取協議，並以討論達爾瑪希亞羣島及處理戰爭犯，列於今日議程之首。四外長預定今日舉行兩次會議，將盡可能範圍，竭力淸除意見相左各點，俾後日會議時，得以專心聽取南斯拉夫及義大利專家，就該兩國間伊斯特里亞邊界及特里埃斯特問題，陳述意見。據美方人士稱：外長外表昨夜集議時，決定將達爾瑪希亞及戰爭犯兩項問題，列入今日議程，惟戰犯爲誰，並未說明。消息靈通觀察家預料外長會議，現已開始入第二週，將致力於討論對義國及巴爾幹各國和的問題，而對巴爾幹各國和的之商計，將繼續進行至第三週，或許最後一週之多數時間，將硏究德國問題。關於義國殖民地，尤其是利比亞，各外長意見仍大相逕庭，英方主張利比亞獨立，法方提議委託義國管理，美國贊成委託聯合國管理，蘇聯則提出計劃，主張義國殖民地，分別委託叫國之一，得義國協助，會同管理。（按：達爾瑪希亞羣島位於亞得里亞海之東岸。）</p>
<h3>設對義管制會美建議遭蘇反對</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎二日電〕四國外長會議昨討論任命盟國管制委員會，以監視義大利履行條約之問題時，貝爾納斯與莫洛托夫曾起爭執，結果未能成立最後協議。其後復檢討整個義大利問題，並選擇今日會議中之議程，貝爾納斯建議設立四國控制委員會，監督義和約一般的履行，不以軍事條款爲限，此乃去年九月倫敦外長會議可曾討論者，然莫洛托夫則認此舉有損義大利主權，不可實行。貝爾納斯並謂於建立此項機構後，可使義大利不受任何國家單獨之指責。英代表貝文贊成貝爾納斯之主張，法國並無肯定立塲，惟云在原則上贊成設立盟國控制委員會。莫洛托夫抗爭後，貝爾納斯乃提議採納去年九月倫敦會議之原則，即控制委員會，僅以監督軍事條款之履行爲其職責，而莫洛托夫仍持反對，一般猜測莫洛托夫之意在預防在羅。保·匈等國設立類似之委員會。</p>

<h3>巴勒斯坦全境　今日發動總罷工抗議英美調查報告書　英駐軍大增防止動亂</h3>

<h3>德國怨女多　徵婚廣告洋洋大觀　有的自稱「黑裏俏」</h3>
<p>〔聯合社德國佛蘭克福一日電〕德國的婚姻市場，目前頗呈蓬勃之象。佛蘭克福市內許多張貼廣告的地方，一面貼着出售貨物的廣告，另一面就是曠夫怨女所登的徵婚啓事。有些報紙的分類廣吿欄內，也充滿了這樣的徵婚小啓。德國因爲這次大戰，死了很多的男十，造成了女多男少的現象。美軍佔領區內，十九歲至四十五歲的德國人，共中每四個女人祇有一個男人。爲了女多於男，所以登徵婚啓事的人也以女性佔多數。但現在男人徵婚的數目正在一天一天的增加，因爲從俘虜營裏釋放出來的德國人，日漸增多，他們出來之後，想開始過一種新的生活。徵婚人老的少的全有，有還不滿二十歲的少女，也有六十幾歲的老頭子和老太婆，其中很多女子，因爲戰爭的關係，年紀輕輕就做了寡婦。女性登的徵婚啓事中時常以有住宅和傢具爲號召，因爲這些在德國都是不大容易得到的東西。一個二十九歲的寡婦，在微婚啓事中，稱她自己爲『黑裏俏」，而且還特別聲明她擁有傢具。又有一位四十歲的寡婦，聲稱本人很「好看」而且有一個十九歲生得很漂亮的兒子，最後又附稱：在奧勃登有住宅及花園一座。不少的婦女在登廣吿時先聲明本人非常健康，而把容貌列在次要的地位。大十歲的女人，竟也聲明：「聰明活潑，願與年事稱長的與子爲偶」。男人們登的廣吿，沒有女人們那麽嚕囌，但其中一部份却特別聲明「本人非國社黨員」。</p>

<p>〔中央社東京一日合衆電〕日前外相東鄕，經美軍醫證明已能度監獄生活後，於一日夜入獄。</p>
<h3>看東條怎樣自辯</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京二日電〕日戰爭禍首東條英機，今日打破歷來之緘默，謂其辯護狀將聲明此次戰爭中，有關其個人部份之全部歷史，或將在口頭上抨擊英美在戰前各項舉動。據稱：「余將昭吿做界，此次戰爭實乃日本之自衛戰」。東條將於明日以「黷武軍閥」首腦身份出庭受審，被控各項罪狀，自謀殺個人至陰謀支配世界，無所不有。</p>
<p>東條向聯合社記者發表書面談話，表示企圖辯護各點如下：</p>
<p>侵略偏稱自衛</p>
<p>（第一）日本爲一獨立國家，一九四一年時局勢，爲「自衛」計，捨戰爭外別無他道。至於何時即信與英美一戰已不可避免一項問題，將在庭上再行陳述。（第二）日本「不欲侵略任何東方國家」，不過予以「解放」而已。至於利用各該國資源，及對人民權利實施種種限制，乃遂行戰爭所必要，但僅以戰時爲限。（第三）余以首相地位，希望一九四一年之華盛頓談判能吿成功，余發出全部命令，均附有條件，即華盛頓會議倘獲成就，則此項命令應予撤銷。（第四）余以首相兼陸相地位，「在原則上」贊成自中國撤軍，此爲談判之重大障碍，但僅可在「某種條件」下實行撤退，對中國媾和即爲其中之一項。</p>
<p>暴露軍部內情</p>
<p>東條又以慓悍之態度，直接答復問題稱：戰爭發生之初，「余當然相信日本將獲勝」。東條此種表示，顯見對於每一款罪狀，將與檢察官爭辯。東條並承認曾反對日本投降，據稱，「余曾在重臣會議中表示此項見解，但並未出以何項行動以阻止投降」。惟其子婿古賀少校曾因發起阻止日皇於波茨坦宣言後投降、企圖不遂，乃切腹自殺。柬條並稱，將當庭陳述戰前日陸海軍間長期衝突情形。關於日海軍全部若於一九四一年堅決反對東條，而不僅出以個人的反對行動，則東條是否將改變態度一問題，渠將在庭審中予以答覆。</p>
<p>還想忍辱偷生</p>
<p>其他日人謂東條於一九四一年出任首相，係預謀計劃，但東條自稱，「一九四一年十月十日拜受組閣大命時，余殊出意外，但一經出任首相，自當全力以赴」。一手發動戰爭，亦一手使戰爭失敗之東條，認為戰爭如此結局，實為「遺憾」。此際渠希望日本能在「新旗幟下復興」，渠已完全不復作自殺之企圖，且在其各項答覆中，明白表示將在受審時力爭。</p>

<h3>歐洲許多繁複問題　外長會議能解決麼？</h3>
<p>— 本報倫敦特約記者　雪岩</p>
<p>歐洲戰事的結束，至今雖已近一年，但收拾這戰後殘局和規定戰敗國今後與其他各國關係的和的，還在摸索之中，眉目未淸。這到不能怪當事者的怠慢，而是問題實在複雜。彼此利害衝突，見解交錯之處，誰都不肯輕易讓步，問題自然就不易解決了。去年九月，五强外長在倫敦開會時，就討論到此事，但倫敦外長會議的結果，誰都知道祇落得一場口舌是非，成績幾乎可說等於零。以後十二月間便有莫斯科的三長會議，繼續討論此事，從五外長變成三外長會議，本身便是一件妥協折中的成果。倫敦會議觸礁的主因之一，是蘇聯反對中法二國參加，莫斯科會議中果然沒有中法二國在內，不論英美解釋怎樣，蘇聯外交已得到實際上的初步勝利。莫斯科會議中，對於歐洲和的部分，決定由柏林會議中參與設立外長會議協定國家的外長代表，立即起草對義大利，羅馬尼亞，保加利亞，匈牙利及芬蘭的和的，待和的草成後，再召開和平會議，正式簽訂。　起草和的的方法決定後，四國外長的代表，就在倫敦工作，進度如何，因爲各方關防甚嚴，外人不知其詳。但各國當局，偶然發起牢騷來，也不免洩漏出一點消息來。大致說來，四國外長代表三個多月來工作的成績，舉得出來的，祇是意見相左之點，多於相同之點。貝爾納斯乃提議由各國外長再度親自出馬，於四月廿五日在巴黎舉行四外長會議，希望能解決紛爭之點。他這提議立刻獲得英法蘇，三國的贊同，於是外長會議如期在巴黎舉行了。不過各方紛爭之點，是否能照預定解決，我們現在不能言之過早。　四强之間，所不肯互相讓步之點，是些什麼呢？因爲商談時期，各方咸守秘密，我們很難確知其內容。但就各方直接間接傳出來的話結集起來，也勉强可知道一個輪廓。</p>
<p>在外長代表會議中，最先商討的，是對義大利的和約條款草案。例如關於如何解決義大利殖民地一點，英國原來主張暫不談判，後來因各國反對，又彷彿自行放棄原議的，蘇聯要求把的黎波里坦尼亞（Tripoliamie）交給蘇聯託治，英美大爲反對。至於法國對此態度如何，我們很少聽到。英國爲什麽主張暫不談判呢？因爲義大利的殖民地，現在大部分在英軍佔領之下，實際和英國的殖民地差不多，旁人或則對英國的佔領和管理不無懷疑之處，英國本身是毫不需疑懼，而且具有充分把握的，相信多佔一天，吃虧的決不是英國，所以他主張慢慢的談，能拖延就拖延。也恐怕正因如此，各國都表示反對。蘇聯爲什麼要求託治的黎波里坦尼亞呢？常然不是喜歡自找麻煩。託治是這次聯合國機構下的新制度，將來實際演變怎樣，我們自然不能預言。但託治制是脫胎於國聯的委任統治制，而加以改進的。委任統治的成績，今日前例具在，太平洋上日本所委治的島嶼不去說他，就講南非英法國所委治的領土罷，與殖民地究竟相去幾何，也很難估計。因此，我們猜想，蘇聯要求託治的黎波里坦尼亞，心目中先存一個委治地的底子，或則不致大錯。至於英美爲什麽反對呢？就英國說，中東近東，向來被認爲是英國通達遠東，及印度的交通要害。有一個强國的勢力，伸入道地帶時，英國就認定它是競爭的對象，帝俄，法國及義大利都曾先後，或同時和英國在這一帶角逐過。現在蘇聯勢力，已深入巴爾幹，滲透伊朗，更要求自由出入於韃靻尼爾（Dard）enells）海峽，如果再在東非立下基礎，聯成一氣，簡直是大英帝國的心腹受威嚇，反對是當然的。伊朗問題，鬧得四鄰不安，這也是主要原因之一，的黎波里坦尼亞的問題，雖無聲無響，但英國反對之熱烈，恐亦不减於伊朗問題。美國對於託治制，向有很多理論，祇是舉世滔滔，很少供她作理想實騐的地方。現在發現義大利的殖民地，尙為一無主之地，覺得不失為一機會，主張即在義大利的殖民地上，試行“國際共管的託治制。因此，單就義大利殖民地處置問題一點而言，已可知道各方意見相左之甚了，共他有的是更複雜的問題。</p>
<p>義大利是否應賠款？應賠多少？怎樣分配？都是外長代表所應解決的問題。英美目前的政策，是在穩定歐洲的局面，促使各國經濟的甦蘇。義大利不似德國那樣可怕，但亦爲歐洲主要國之一，所以對於義大利的經濟復原，看得很重。要義大利經濟能早日復原，則對他的賠款要求，不應過苛。英美法本身是彷彿不要求義大利賠款了，而對蘇聯為其本國所要求的實物賠款一億美元，和爲南斯拉夫，希臘與阿爾巴尼亞要求賠實物二億美元，認爲太苛，有碍義大利經濟的後蘇，反對甚力。其他義大利殘餘艦隊的處置，聽說蘇聯要求四分之一，英美法也都反對。再義大利將來的軍備問題，怎樣限制，各國意見也不一致，法國幾度受强鄰的侵入，創鉅痛深，最怕再有强鄰，在其左右，所以對義大利的軍備限制問題，聽說法國意見最多。此外法國還要求法義邊界的若干軍略地點，以固邊防。他如特里斯埃斯特Trieste等地的處置，現正在等待四國委員的調査報吿書，但道是源遠流長的紛爭之地，也難望其有完善的解決。</p>
<p>現在和約草案中，除了義大利外，聞已討論到匈牙利的間題。匈牙利現爲蘇聯的與國，去年已和蘇聯單獨訂立商的，英國曾經反對，最近匈國總理外長以及其他若干部長。聯袂赴蘇，又簽訂條約多種，所以在蘇聯看來，匈牙利早已不是敵國。而且匈牙利對英美等國任何讓步，皆直接間接影響到蘇聯的已得利益，所以在和議席上，蘇聯將袒護匈牙利，是可以預測的‘。　保加利亞和羅馬尼亞，英美始終認爲其不够民主，政府中還應容納其他黨派的人士，蘇聯則同氣相求，關係非常親密，所以英美和蘇聯的見解又相左是不成問題的。比較最簡單的是對芬蘭的和約，因爲祗有英蘇二國，問題容易解決，聽說現在商討已頗有進步，這是這次和的草案商談中最有成績的部分。</p>
<p>由於上述的分析中，我們知道問題是如何時繁複，四外長是否能完全解決，現在自難預測。聽說萬一不成，英美準備與義大利等單獨言和，這當然是最後的一法，不得已的下策。我想英美目前縱然有此準備，也祗是防萬一的。而且衝突之點雖多，也並不是完全不能妥協約，或則先擇能妥協約部分，草成折中案，而把實在不能妥協約部分，留待日後解決，這未始不是一法，而且從各方面看，似乎還是最可能的一法。（四月二十三日寄自倫敦）</p>

<p>新聞界敗類</p>
<h3>許力求受審　雙重傀儡　供被林逆拖拉下水　祇做做傳聲筒罷了</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕在敵偽盤據期內，曾經煊赫一時的上海新聞界敗類許力求，已於昨晨十時許，開始在高院審理。許逆前任汪逆精衛之機關報「中華日報」代理社長，發表荒謬言論，迷惑人民意識。昨日由邱煥瀛推事開第一庭傳訊，許身材矮小，穿灰黑色長衫，鼻架眼鏡，臉有慍色，行動甚遲鈍，答問時發音低微，常帶口吃。據供稱：廣東中山人，今年四十三歲，住西愛咸斯路一七一一號。於民國廿一年即入「中華日報」任事，該報變節後，「爲了生活問題」，被偽宣傳部長林柏生拖拉下水，審判長問他：「爲何要發表許多荒謬言論」？許即自認傀儡說：「該報一切社務，原由林柏生自己負責，所有一切言論，都是直接從南京發來，我祇是具名做做傳聲筒罷了。不過我曾寫過文章駡陳彬龢」審判長問：「你們在同一個陣營裏爲什麽還要互相攻擊？」答：「我根本反對陳彬龢的荒謬言論，本來我預備到內地去，可是交通困難，又找不到關係，恐怕爲了曾任僞職，被政府逮捕，所以沒有去，祇好痛罵陳彬龢。」問：「你曾出席「大東亞」新聞協會，在何時？」答：「在卅三年冬」。問：「你又担任過僞新聞協會首席理事？」答稱是。問：「是誰接收偽中華日報的？」答：「是市黨部吳紹澍光生接收去的，不過在勝利後一天，我曾出過和平號外」。審判長正言厲色道：「難道出過和平號外，便不能算漢奸嗎？眞是狡辯！」遂令被吿還押，候改期再訊。此次審理，許逆未延律師辯護，並無家屬到庭旁聽。</p>
<p>楊逆志為猶圖狡賴</p>
<p>又審楊志爲案，楊爲無錫人，二十入歲，民國廿四年曾留學日本，民三十年七月，在滬應考「七十六號」特工之考試，錄取爲繙譯，派往僞淸鄕委員會蘇州辦事處，任助理秘畫。次年春升任僞江蘇省政府薦任秘書，三十二年八月，改任僞江蘇省政府建設廳秘書兼僞米糧統制委員會蘇州辦事處副主任。三十四年一月至四月，又任僞江蘇省保安司令部少校參謀等僞職。勝利後由軍統局逮捕解案，昨晨審問時，楊逆猶岡狡賴，庭上乃諭改期再訊。</p>

<h3>逆產處理辦法　不久可望決定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕最近各地審判漢奸案件，業已積極進行，惟漢奸財產究應如何處理，至今尙無明確辦法，記者因特走訪蘇浙皖敵僞產業處理局各有關部門負責人，承吿：漢奸案件，目前已確定判決者，爲數尙少，該局曾與滬高院對逆產處理，數度洽商，依法律規定，自應由法院處置，但該局與司法行政部同係屬於行政院之國家機關，而法院人手不多，處理此龐大逆產，事實上亦或有困難，故此問題之解決，當不出下列三途：（一）由法院辦理；（二）變更法律之規定，改由敵僞產業處理局辦理，惟此舉極費時日，恐將有緩不濟急之病；（三）由法院委託敵　產業處理局辦　另由法院與該局合組適當聯合機構，負監督之責聞該局劉局長已決定向宋院長請示辦法，不久當即可決定。至日前若干尙未判決之漢奸嫌疑犯財產，則已由該局遵照宋院長指示，凡金銀珠寳，委託中央銀行代爲保管，房地產則委託中央信託局代爲保管，物資則交海關代爲保管，均未加以處理。如法院宣吿該漢奸嫌疑犯爲無罪，則其產業即由該局立即發還。又敵僞產業處理局於短期內即將撤銷，而漢奸案件之全部審結判決，恐尙須相當時日，該局逆產組究將如何繼續工作，現在亦未決定。</p>

<h3>屋荒聲中好消息　金屋不久可到</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市流動金屋投資公司，最近陸續向美國蒙高茂萊嚴訂購流動金屋，供應本市市民需要。値此房荒嚴重時期，此類輕使房屋抵滬後，將可解決一部房荒。據該公司總經理張煥章昨午吿記者，第一批金屋將於四十日後運滬，乃由該公司自訂者，但抵此後，仍可出售。現計共訂一百餘幢，將於二月內全部　達。本年內預計訂購二千幢。</p>
<p>此屋係由「單位」組合而成，每單位寬八呎，長二十呎，高的七呎，屋頂每十二吋傾斜四吋。屋頂和牆壁皆用特製之二十四號鉛片嵌釘而成，屋架用鋼鐵構造，並塗油漆兩層，由輻射熱火爐烘乾，無損銹之弊。門戶配有木門及其他金屬製成之零件；窗戶係鋼架及化學玻璃及其他金屬零件製成；每窗配有靑銅或紫銅製成之百葉窗簾，地板爲鋼製框架，加以鋼桁，舖以木板。全部房屋配有半寸厚緊硬之絕緣板，以隔絕音限。</p>
<p>該屋定價邊間每間美金八百四十六元九角，中間每問美金七百元。每組有邊間二間，中間一間，共計美金二千三百九十三元八角。目前所定空屋最大者可另添中間一間。款辦法，則照定價先付五成，餘款在交貨時付清，但碼頭關稅則由定戶自理。</p>
<p>希望銀行界投資准市民分期付款</p>
<p>張氏繼稱：此屋到滬後，如定戶自備地皮則更佳，公司方面現正與市府常局接洽，可能劃撥前法租界及虹橋一帶空地若干，供市民租用或購買，其價格當較一般地產商爲低。同時爲使一般市民均能解決房屋問題計，亟盼銀行界能投資購買，而准市民分期付款，則可减輕居民一部負担。</p>
<p>張氏又謂美國本身亦不鬧房荒，故如其他木製活動房屋等，均不能供應國外，現該公司仍竭力設法與美方接洽要求盡量供給。</p>
<h3>蓬萊虹口開票的結果　姚慕蓮汪竹一等當選　長寗榆林重選期未定</h3>

<h3>當局苦心孤詣　調整公用事業價目　水電等各公司逐月虧空數字龐大　目前所增只能顧到最低維持費用</h3>
<p>— 本報記者蒼龍</p>
<p>物價的波瀾，似乎平靜下來了。公用事業不有放過這千載一時的良機；電車，公共汽車，水和電等新價目，都紛紛經過當局的批准，而先後實行了。這是當局的一番「苦心孤詣」，因爲他們說過，公用事樂常受物價的影響　而非物價父公用事業的影饗。又說公用事業應以服務社會，改輕市民負擔爲主要目標，然而又須使他獲得最低限度的維持費用。使能延續不斷……在這種種針鋒相對的前提下，要定一個面面俱到的調整價格，確不是樁容易的事。記者想從各方面所搜集到的資料，和讀者共同硏討一下這次調整的情形。</p>
<p>三等電車增三千倍</p>
<p>先說電車，要是把本市英商電車戰前的票價，和最近的調整價驟相比較，可以看出最低票價的增漲率，比較特別銳利。據調査戰前三等最高銅元廿七枚（合九分），最低銅元六枚（合二分）；現在三等最高一百二十元，增加了一千三百卅三倍。三等最低六十元，增加了恰巧三千倍。再說頭等，戰前最高銅元卅三枚（合一角一分），最低銅元八枚（合三分弱）；現在頭等最高二百元，增加了一千八百十八倍。最低九十元，增加比率已超過三千倍。這是一個趣味性的對照，聽到最低票價的增漲倍數，也許會嚇壞你；可是，畢竟因爲以前銅元時代的底價太低了，現在縱使加上幾千倍，比較鄉些朝天討價的人力車三輪車，還是綽有餘裕。請看車廂還不是照樣的擠得滿坑滿谷，乘客口裏儘管會本能地埋怨一聲漲價，心照不宜的還是價廉物美！</p>
<p>水電加價高低不同</p>
<p>再說水和電，戰前本市英商自來水公司的水費，是每百加侖七分五厘。現在是五十四元五角五分，增加了七百廿六倍。法商水電公司是以立方公尺爲計算單位的。戰前每立方公尺水費是八分七厘五毫，現在是一百二十元，增加了一千三百七十倍。電費方面，戰前美商上海電力公司是每瓩時一角六分八厘，現在是五十元，（指小量用戶消費量在十瓩時以內者），增加了二百九十九倍。法商水電公司戰前每瓩時是一角八分二厘，現在價錢和上海電力公司一樣，增加了二百七十四倍。這兩方面比較下來，雖說法商水電公司的水費，增加的倍數較大，而電費從增加的倍數看起來，應該是最低廉的了！</p>
<p>煤氣電話便宜之至</p>
<p>電話費現在也調整了。在尙未調整價格以前，美國上海電話公司裏的一個職員，曾打趣地向記者說，要是照目前該公司裝置電話的費用計算，（裝置電話一具，須裝置費五千元，保證金一萬元）。只要公司裏有電話，那末三敎九流的人物，都可人手一具了。至於通話的費用，戰前營業用電話每月一百次，收費十元；現在（指最近調整之前，下同。（收費爲一千五百元，增加了一百五十倍。戰前住宅用電話，每月六十五次，收費六元半；現在收費九百七十五元，也增加了一百五十倍。比起水電增加的倍數來，越見低廉了。至於煤氣，英商上海自來火公司在戰前每度（一百立方英尺）收費二角八分五厘，現在收費一百九十元，只增加了六百六十六倍。以上的價格，是根據前月份計算的。</p>
<p>公用事業虧空數字</p>
<p>再看其他公用事業的虧空帳，英商電車公司三月份計虧一萬八千萬元，前後累虧至九萬六千萬元；法商永電公司三月份計虧一萬七千萬元，前後累虧至七萬八千七百萬元；美商上海電話公司三月份計虧一萬五千萬元……然而爲了顧到最大多數平民的負担，當局對各該公司價格的調整，祇限於目前最低維持費用的獲得。所謂維持費用，是限於薪工燃料及業務上必需的開支。所有折舊官利紅利等，都暫不計入。我們際解各公用事業當前處境的苦悶，我們體騐當局對課整價格的一番苦心，所以到目前爲止，公用事業的價格，還是物價狂瀾中的一塊桃源。讓我們默禱這桃源，將日益發榮滋長，以挽物價在瀾於既倒！</p>

<h3>湯恩伯王懋功　在南通廿小時　振奮了古城老百姓的心</h3>
<p>— 廿四日南通訊　冷冰寄</p>
<p>幾天前，南通就傳着將有一位軍政要員蒞臨的消息，對於本縣民衆，是一種振奮人心，打開目前局勢的興奮劑。街頭巷尾，大家都在打聽這位大員到吾？或是某某長官來了沒有的消息。而我們同行——記者，成爲他們問訊的目標。他們滿以爲新聞記者有耳聽八方的技巧，從這方面或者可以探出一些端倪來。可是，慚愧得很，我們的耳朶太短了，回答他們的是一個「不懂」！</p>
<p>懷念蘇北抽暇閃電蒞臨</p>
<p>鄧克中校乘機來通，大家神經又爲之一緊張，以爲這「次來的一定是軍政要負了。可是，報紙的報導是「來人非也」，這又是一件掃興的事。淮陰小組翌日即飛淮陰，徐州而去。</p>
<p>終於傳言證實了，而且蒞臨的長官，不只是一位。——綰理全省的王主席懋功氏，和在抗戰期間建立殊勳現在坐鎭京滬一帶的湯司令官。他們並沒有忘記蘇北，時時懷念着水深火熱中蘇北的苦難同胞。所以雖在軍政紛紜中抽空來到這古老的城池。——南通。這更是一個珍貴的消息，</p>
<p>一個足以振奮人心的消息！</p>
<p>記者們前晚就得到湯將軍和王主席由澄專輪蒞通的喜訊。昨天（二十三）得到關係方面的通知，出席上午十時更俗劇塲的各界歡迎大會。爲了職務的關係，很平就到了會塲。</p>
<p>舉行座談　慰勞勸勉有加</p>
<p>湯恩伯上將，省主席王懋功，在前（二十二）晚六時由澄乘民權軍艦由任港登陸，全城商店民衆居戶均懸着鮮明燦爛的國旗以示歡迎，馬路上警衛森嚴，秩序佳良。此間一〇五師劉師長，徐專員，楊縣長，紀書記長，新聞記者公會顧理事長，商整會錢主委均紛紛赴港迎迓，二位軍政長官專車抵桃塢路桃之華館略事休息後，接見地方眾政首長，聽取工作報吿。二十三日上午八時就一〇五師司令部舉行座談會，首由湯司令官，王主席先後致其慰勞勸勉之詞，次由錢商整會主委暨如皋縣長王運典，分別陳述意見旋即散會，相偕出席，赴更俗劇場之本縣各界歡迎大會，樓上下聽衆，座無隙地，可稱空前盛况。十時正，會塲軍樂聲大作，湯司令官王主席相繼蒞臨，湯氏身御黃色軍服，王主席御丈靑色中山裝，均各精神爽健，態度軒昂，於羣衆肅穆歡迎行列中，拾級登壇，二位長官很謙虛地含笑答禮。</p>
<p>完成建設　萬萬不可再打</p>
<p>徐專員致開會詞後，首先敬請湯司令官致訓詞，司令官在熱烈的掌聲中開始講話。他的態度是那樣的沉着而興奮，說起話來是那麽樣的熱情而明澈，每句話，每個字，都强烈地打入每個人的心坎裏。他首先說明了抗戰的勝利是從艱苦奮鬥中得來的，以落後的中國，戰勝了準備充足的日寇，更是値得驕傲的光榮。目前的一切不合理的現象與苦難，乃是戰後必有的現象，而且是意料中的事。我們只有咬緊牙關，繼續努力，以期完成建設，所以在這個時期，不容許悲觀灰心，更不能動搖。他明顯地指示着我們，今後的努力目標。今後一切間題，光打不是辦法，何况萬萬不可再打了。所以解決的方法不是「打」，而是『爭』，要據理力爭。並且今後還應在國家第一，民族至上的原則之下，遵照委座的指示，及國家的國策，向和平建國大道邁進。因爲我們不但贏得了勝利，同時還要贏得了和平。人叢中爆烈了一陳粱聲。最後，他更指出南通經濟，文化，實業在江蘇以及全國的重要性。要復興南通，第一須鞏固治安，然後一切才有辦法。他很眞誠鄭重負責加以申說。</p>
<p>破壞治安　一律都要嚴辦</p>
<p>湯司令官訓話時神彩奕奕，發音洪亮，而高低抑揚，動人至深，做手勢一揮一舉頗見功力，講到「不管是什麽人破壞南通地方治安，一律嚴辦，嚴辦……」尤其顯出虎將勇毅果斷的風度來。</p>
<p>最後，他對南通的希望很大，並且希望黨政軍團一致合作，共爲建設新南通與新中國而努力。又是一陣春雷似的掌聲。這正是我們目前迫切的要求。</p>
<p>認識時代　寄厚望於青年</p>
<p>接着，王主席開始訓話：他訓示我們應當認識時代，而現在的中國，是由破壞而入於建設，由戰爭而入於和平的大時代。如果有人加以破壞，就是全國人民的蟊賊，羣衆的公敵，而對於拯救蘇北同胞，政府決沒有忘記，並宣佈了省府的施政方針；是恢復秩序，安定民生，按照建國程序，建立自治機構。由眞正的民意機關，造成眞正的民意，這就是三民主義的真民主。最後對於負担建設新中國的下一代靑年學生，寄予了最殷切的期望。因爲他們是新的機構，新的細胞，是後一代的基層，責任綦重，應當安心讀書，信仰三民主義，宣傳三民主義，實行三民主義，然後才能做新的幹部，做後一代的繼承人，做江蘇省的主人。各校教師們允須有精神，勤儉耐勞，堅忍克苦，堅定自信心，不以物資的缺乏而萌退志。</p>
<p>會後參觀先後登艦南渡</p>
<p>接着，徐專員代表全體民衆向司令官及王主席致熱烈的　意，全體起立三鞠躬。因爲時間的關係，湯司令官急於回無錫去，大會就在熱烈興奮的氣氛中宣吿結東了。</p>
<p>散會後，湯司令官專車偕劉師長，于副師長等，赴唐閘大生紗廠參觀，由吳　階先生陪同參觀車間一週後，記者追隨前往。至一時半，湯司令官以急於返防，轉驅天生港，逕登汽艇，開往任家港軍艦。王主席於散會後，由徐專員，楊縣長等陪同至專署，縣府，縣衛生院，縣黨部，汽車站等各機關視察一週後，即搭乘專車赴任家港登艦南渡。</p>
<h3>巡禮寶島上的最高學府　台灣醫學界搖籃</h3>
<p>— 廿八日航訊　本報駐台特派員暮雲寄</p>
<p>作爲發揚台灣高等敎育的最高學府　國立合灣大學，擁有十八年的歷史，它不僅在美麗的寳島上，是一塊　，而在遠東的學術界，也佔有崇高的優越的地位。記者在一個晴朗的上午，趕到水道町的大學本部，作了個輪廓的巡視。</p>
<p>合大的前身是台北帝國大學，十八年前它只有理農學部，文政學部，十年前始設立了醫學部，一一一年前復添了工學部，接收以後，除文學院和法學院要待秋季成立外，其餘各學院，都已循入正軌。</p>
<p>深沉的荒漠感</p>
<p>記者穿過椰子林下的石子路，走進了墨痕未乾的大學之內，成行列的紅色的洋樓，靜悄悄地元立在荒烟瀰漫的草原裏。在蒼老的紅牆上，到處彈痕纍纍，如今震碎了的玻窗已改裝上了木板，但玻璃屑還深種在野草的頂端。文學院，理學院第一館二館……都是靜靜的呆着，農事化騐室裹，有少數的學生在零亂的儀器堆裏作着沉着的試騐；被炸毀了的學舍，匠工在慢條斯理地修茸着。工學院的佈吿板上，貼着「自三十四年十月至本年三月授業科學生應速補繳學費六十元」以及「四月二十日學期結束，二十二日至二十八日學期考試，五月二日第二學期開始」的通吿，稀落的着黑制服的學生拖着木展在走着，一種深沉的荒漠之感襲上心來，使我意識到冲淡了的學術空氣，大學還逗留在戰時的階段！</p>
<p>杜博士的領導</p>
<p>具有領導性的並不是其他各學院，實際是研究與實施並重的醫學院。現任院長是五十七歲的杜聰明博士，他是權威的本省人醫學界的領導者，他不僅領導着醫學院在學的學生，和醫學院前身醫學專門學校已畢業而行醫的二千個校友，而且是担任了熱帶病院硏究所，台大第一附屬醫院（有一百個醫生在這佔有一萬五千坪面積的醫院，爲每天數百病人工作着）第二附屬醫院（前身是日本紅十字醫院）的負責人。合灣的醫學界忘不了杜博士，而在杜博士那和藹的老敎授的風度和沉靜的性格上，更可以看到本省人追求醫學和科學發展的深度</p>
<p>他吿訴記者，在轟炸疏散期間，他們是怎樣費盡心機來保存醫學院和大學全部的心血結晶機械，圖書，藥品，標本……。他們疏散到台北的郊外大溪，在一個國民學校裹繼續研究，學習，差不多有半年以上的時間，有百分之九十以上的精華被保存着。</p>
<p>在過去，全大學的學生，本省人所佔的成份很少的，可是研究醫學的本省人獨多，如今日籍的學生跟着家長遺散了，現在全部是本省和少數外省的學生，總數二百人。杜博士現正忙着從東京遣散回國的本省靑年學生繼續求學的安排。他很感興地說，被徵用的。籍名敎授，還留用着，總數有十四五人。而本奮人担任敎授，副敎授，講師的總數却在三四十人以上。</p>
<p>台大過去設立大學院，及硏究科有四百人以上得到了學位。此次組織改變了，它也將和國內的大學一樣，畢業後給予醫學士學位。</p>
<p>在杜博士實際領導之下，除醫學院一百餘名的學生以外，有三四百個工作者在對醫學作深湛的研究，他們是本省病家的救星，也將是未來新中國醫學界的搖籃</p>
<p>學術上的交流</p>
<p>在醫學上一般的研究着瘧疾，人類學，寄生虫，蛇毒，漢藥，鴉片，實騐病理學，營養學，肺結核，甲狀腺病等熱帶病，這中間有很多已是在省內很有名的人物，而在台北市郊外的士林鎭熱帶病院研究所支所裏，他們更研究成功的有血淸，痘苗，和傷寒，虎列拉等的注射劑。尤其是血淸，每年可以製作供給五百萬人到一千萬人的注射，也即是本省六百萬人中，每一個人一年可打兩次。</p>
<p>痘苗，他們發明了不只是液體，而是乾燥性痘苗，只要在應用時泡在水裏就可以種了，這是痘苗的革命。</p>
<p>在熱帶病院裏，其他主要的工作是檢査藥品的化學科，熱帶病科，熱帶衛生科，厚生學科，和側重分析和試用功效的中藥科，對於國醫，杜博士聲述了他的意見，他說：「原來國醫學的問題，是黃帝內經太素經以來所傳的醫理，一方面却以陰陽，五行及五運六氣來說明抽象的哲學的理諭，也是一個空想的理論，可是再深究一下，實在是國醫的治療法，譬如張仲景的「傷寒雜症論」，實在是實際的實踐的學說及很有效能的治療方法，所以我很同意以國醫作爲參考的話。」接着他說：「眞理是一元的，國醫要是能不局限在一個Circel裏兜圈子，而通過現代科學方法和科學敎育，定可以獲致更大的效果的。」</p>
<p>他特別指出，有兩種以上的特效藥已經明得到了成果，一是飯匙倩以蛇毒抽出一種有效成份作鎭痛劑，已在四年前取得特許權。還有苦參子以爲赤痢症的特效藥，這個硏究報告在二十日下午台灣醫學會上公開發表，關於中藥，他們非但不放棄，而將加强硏究，準備設立漢藥治療科，責成祖任淸算和發揚中藥的重任。</p>
<p>杜博士鄭重地說明了合大醫學院的四個使命，（一）儘可能的選拔本省醫生和專門人才到國內從事衛生工作；（二）歡迎國內醫生和學者到本省來硏究；（三）將研究品輸送到國內去，（四）與國內專門的學者組織純學術研究性的學會。</p>

<h3>杭州也在鬧屋荒</h3>
<p>— 本報廿九日訊　特派員儲裕生寄</p>
<p>杭州爲了米荒，曾經打過米店，然而現在杭州又鬧着屋荒，又去打誰呢？</p>
<p>有一個在省府做事的人對記者說：「在杭州，娶媳婦還容易，找房子是難事。」我們每天在街上跑，或在茶館酒店裏坐坐，總是可以看見找房子的人和談房子事的人。這裏不僅是外鄉人，還有很多杭州人，不僅是沒有房子的人，而且還有自己有房子的人。</p>
<p>杭州戰前人口最多時爲七十八萬八，現在沒有準確的統計，據說只有四十多萬人，則少了三十萬人。杭州市區的房屋很少毀壞，大概有二十分之一是破損了的。但人口的减少已不止二十分之一了。即使南星橋閘口的房子破壞得多，因而人口集中在市區，但據老杭州說，南星橋閘口人口也不會超過十萬人，而且杭州人口四十多萬的的略統計中已經計算在內了。</p>
<p>我們可以這樣說：杭州並沒有屋荒，即使房屋不够，也不致於到如此嚴重的地步。那麽杭州的屋荒在那裏呢？有一位老杭州說：「杭州空房子是有的，但寗願讓它空着，不願意租給人呢！」</p>
<p>在戰前，杭州的房子很容易找得着的，有許多石庫牆門上都貼有「召粗」的條子，戰時，杭州淪陷了，敵偽强佔了很多房子，有的作倉庫，存放東西，有的作敵偽的住宅。戰後，我們的軍隊來接收，把住在民房裏的日本人日本兵，僞兵，僞官一律趕走，換來的是很多的眷屬，後來軍隊走了，眷屬還沒有走，甚至一二個人住着一所大房子。有些房東同別人訂了約，承租的人要來住房子，却被叱喝了出來，不得要領。有的承租人把傢俱搬到屋子裏，向住在屋內的人情商，但住在屋內的喧賓們把傢俱拋到街路上。他們想向他們講理，但是對方是穿着不整齊的軍服的，看不清番號，却彎轉了舌頭，比房屋主人的聲音響亮，比房屋主人來得兇狠，房子像是他們的了。</p>
<p>在沒有辦法之下，請一些另外體面的人去交涉，住在屋內的人又講了：「我根本不喜歡這所房子，我是要搬的，但是外面的房子要出金條，要挖費，又要押租，我們「窮公務員」怎樣租得起呢？我現在正在尋覓房屋，一尋到就搬好了。」眞是理直氣壯。　「幾時搬呢？」　「那要等找到房子再說。」還是得不着要領。有些人說，要房子只有用「勢」，例如大官要房子，則小官只好拚命了，小官怎樣拼命？還不是向人民要。人民沒有辦法時，只好托小官再托大官，向大官說情，送禮。這是官僚的處理房屋糾紛法。這種例子實在太多太多子。</p>
<p>另外有一種房子，是房主人隨着抗戰而進入內地去了，把房屋交給看房子的人管理。看房子的在七八年來，已一躍而爲主人了。他住着一最好的房子，拿押費，拿挖費，等到主人回來要住房子，他說房子已經都租人了。像這種例子不算少的。</p>
<p>還有一種專門做房子生意的房屋販子，他們打聽到了房子以後，就兜攬要租房子的人，承租的人用重價去挖，用重價去押，這些販子，就在其中漁利。</p>
<p>杭州的老百姓素有「杭鐵頭」之稱的，他們可以由憤怒而打毀了米店，但他們不可以由憤怒而打不講理住房子的人。雖然米是食的問題，關係大衆至鉅，但房屋是住的問題，也關係大衆的，不過房屋是一座座一幢幢的，强佔房屋的人可以逐個擊退罷了。</p>
<p>「衣，食，住，行」四大需要，我們要政府米爲人民解決這四大需要，但是政府是不是有辦法，四十多萬的杭州市民在眼服睜的注視着呢！</p>

<h3>湖南的敎育復員</h3>
<p>— 本報長沙特派員　高元禮</p>
<p>「收復區內祇有湖南的敎職員沒有甄審，也祇有湖南的學生沒有甄別，這眞是湖南的光榮，也證明湖南的敎育確有此成就。」湖南敎育廳長王鳳喈先生對記者這樣說。他幷且强調的說，廣大的淪陷區，亦尺有湖南沒有建立偽省府組織，原因還是正直之士相當的多，注重策節的關係，歸根結底的說，還是幾十年的敎育沒有自費氣力。</p>
<p>湖南敎育的發展，不能不歸於譚故院長　庵先生的倡導　　，譚氏主湘時，不但請求立案可以得到批着，而且選在精神上和物質上予以協助，因此　學校也　　一種風氣，二十年的光景，僅僅私立中學校數，增至二百所左右。大部份高參長沙，當時長沙弦　不絕，星期假日市內全是　　布制　的學生，一時傳為美　。</p>
<p>抗戰初起的一二年，湖南的敎育曾發生一些騷動，當武漢淪陷時，長沙局勢搖搖欲墜，學校當局為安全着想，幾乎是全部西遷，大部集中在安化籃田，一部移至沅陵。</p>
<p>長沙大火以後</p>
<p>長沙大火後，局勢輕趨穩定。各校遂得繼續開學，而以沅陵藍田兩地為中心，逐漸發展，這一階段一直維持川三年六月間吿一段落。</p>
<p>在這一階段裏，可說是湖南敎育最盛的時期，省敎育當局在高等敎育，中等敎育，職業敎育，師範敎育。和國民敎有方面，都盡了根當的努力．得到預期的成功。</p>
<p>高等敎育部份，在卅年開辦省立農工商三專科學校，校址均設南嶽，農專設農藝，森林，及農業經濟三科，工專說水利工程，建築工程，化學工程，及鑛治工程四科。商專設銀行會計，統計，及工商管理三科，雖在戰事期間，設備欠缺，但是仍在極度困難情形下開學，實為難得。</p>
<p>中等敎育部份，從卅年春季起，實行分區設學。按照行政督察區劃全省為十個學區，每區以　設省立中學，師範，及職業學校各一所為原則，這一計劃在不久的時期，不但完成，而且超過，卅三年上期，統計全省中學生人數為二十萬人。</p>
<p>國民敎育部份，自廿九年以來，發展頗速，　至三十三年上期止。全省一千六百鄕　中，已設鄕　中心國民學校的達一千五百餘所，分校九十七所，全省二萬一千二百九十保，已設保國民學校二冇零三百餘所，分校四千八百餘所，再益以私立小學六千餘所，省立小學十九所，金計　三成嬽千六百所，入學兒童二百六十五萬九千名。</p>
<p>在上列三項數字裏，可能　出湖南敎育發展的進度，尤其是中小學方面的發展，更為驚人，考其原因，為戰事發生以後，農村相當繁榮，　價上漲，小康之家亦有餘力令子弟入學。（未完）</p>

<p>良華受挫</p>

<p>呢羢商之營業，近來莫不减少，因深色秋冬呢羢，買方均欲等待國外之運到，以致本街及客帮皆無過問，而女色　袍料，刻因天熱，亦相繼落令，所略有交易者，祇係紗蘑膠布白直貢·凡立枯白嗶嘰·羽紗呢派力司·胖皮取法司哥等諸應時夏貨等，然為極種環境關係，貿銷力無較往年為遜，同業中除　　外，營做者甚寡。</p>

<h3>諸暨炒靑上市</h3>
<p>炒靑綠茶，經焙製後，歷年國內外均有相當去化，綠興諸暨新貨，日來已見上市，惟因成本浩大，聞開價每擔七萬元，至於其他花色，蘇州及天津各地之胃納俱亟張盛，人心頻畢堅化，市勢向前邁進，除若干種茶行情賡續升騰外，餘均底盤稔固，而最受歐美各國贊許之特貢綠茶，同業間鑒於售價尙能適合胃口，故依然拖吸，以特機出口云。</p>

<h3>四月份四大市　商業銀行存款</h3>
<p>中央銀行金融檢查處對本市及各主要城市之商業銀行存款總數，每月月底均有詳盡統計，並規定各商業銀行須海中央銀行交納存款準備金，其金額佔存款總數百分之二十，茲將四月份各地存款分列於下：</p>

<p>天津　一三、八六九、二三一、〇一二</p>
<p>南京　二、五三三、〇一七、四三〇</p>
<h3>出口稀少　進口貸淡旺不一</h3>
<p>繡貨　最近出口貿易，以國內貨物多較國外高昂，故極淸淡。頃據匯利進出口行負責人談：謂談行出口貨物，原以花邊，髮網，　花乎帕等為大宗，但目前美國花邊價反較國內便宜，僅髮網與　花手帕尙有微利可圖。並謂是項繡花手帕，以汕頭出品為最佳，但輸出數量最近亦極少，常係運輸不便及生產量缺乏所致</p>
<p>羊毛　英國羊毛，本年四個月來輸入總數已逾他十萬包，該行定貨，佔總數三分之二。</p>
<p>西藥　關於西藥進口方面謂，最近西藥到貨，以美國製藥，派德，茂孚，西藥，標準，普强，國際維他命，挪威等公司之維他命ABC針藥為多數，然他如克寗奶粉數量亦不少，但市上一磅裝貨則奇缺，價雖開始回跌，然因美鈔漲落不定，故貨價亦難　小。</p>
<p>水泥　建築材料如水泥等，最近有到一萬桶，但無利可獲，蓋因關稅由百分之十增加為百分之卅也。</p>
<p>收音機　餘如無綫電收音機，目前各進出口行接受定貨頗多，然根據該行昨日美國發來電報，謂各項收音機，四個月內恐難運滬，現該行已電美國廠商，囑其先搜羅各門市部所有各種收音機，從速運滬，以濟急需。</p>

<h3>不可避免的白人</h3>
<p>— （續完）Jack　London原著　魯莽譯</p>
<p>「薩克思多夫所運氣的是，黑人只在近距離開槍才開得準。他們不大把槍支在他們的肩膀上。他們直等他們到了一個人的近旁，然後他們才把槍支在股上開放。在他的來福槍變得太熱的時候，薩克思多夫就換過了一支。這就是他所以要隨帶兩支來福槍上去的意思。</p>
<p>「使人吃驚的就是地開槍的迅速。還有，他從不放一個脫空。要是眞有什麼東西是不可避免的話，那個人就是。使得那屠殺顯得如此驚恐的就由於他開槍的迅速。黑人要想想的時間都沒有。在他們打算想想的時候，他們就一齊衝到船的一邊，自然使獨木舟傾覆了。薩克思多夫從不停止。水面上滿是的黑人，還是乓，乓，乓，他把他的子彈射進他們的身體。沒有一顆脫空的，我能淸楚地聽到每一顆子彈都朴的一聲穿進人的肉裏面去。</p>
<p>「黑人散了開來，而向着海岸游過去。水面上是一層在震動的人頭。我站了起來，好像在一個夢中，而望着這一切——那在震動的人頭和那停止了震動的人頭。幾槍遙遠的射擊是很可誇耀的。祗有一個人達到了海岸，可是正在他站了起來要在海岸上舉步的時候，薩克思多夫打中了他。這是美匯的。而在有兩個黑人奔過來想把他從水裏拖起來的時候，薩克思多夫也打中了他們。</p>
<p>「我想什麽事情都過去了，却正在那時我又聽得了來福槍的槍聲。一個黑人從大艙的出入口爬了出來，在向欄杆奔去，而在它的牛途跌了下來。大艙裏他們擠得滿滿的。我數一數是二十個。他們一次上來一個，而即向欄杆衝去。可是他們從沒有到達那里。這使我想起了飛靶射繫。」個黑身體會從大艙的出入口爬出來，薩克思多夫的來福槍會砰一聲響，黑身體便會向下跌倒。自然，那些在下面的人並不知道在甲板上發生些什麼事情，所以他們繼續爬出來直到最後一個被，打光爲止。</p>
<p>「薩克思多夫等了一忽兒，看的確沒有了，他才降落到了甲板上。他和我是從公爵夫人號的全體人員所被遺下來的僅有的兩個，我是壞得一些都不能動，而他現在射擊完結了又什麽用處都沒有。依我的指導他洗凈了我頭蓋上的傷處，而把它們縫了起來。喝了一大口威士忌使我毅然用力站了起來。沒有什麽別的事情可做了。其餘的人都死了。薩克思多夫試欲把帆張起來，他扯着，我握着繩卷。他又變成了愚蠢的一無所知的水手了。他是一個小錢都不値的，而在我暈倒了的時候，看來我們是什麽都完了。</p>
<p>『在我淸醒過來的時候，薩克思多夫不知所可地坐在欄杆上，在等着，問我他該做什麼，我吿訴他査察受傷的人，看是不是還有個把能爬動的。他一起聚攏了六個。一個，我記得，折斷了一條腿；可是薩克思多夫說他的臂勝還是好好的。我是躺在陰影裏，在趕走蒼蠅，並指導怎樣包紮，而薩克思多夫就在指揮他的被醫治的一羣。要是他並不，在地找得升降索的以前，使那些可憐的黑人都升起在絆索台的上每一條繩子上的話，我就會感謝不盡了。其中的一個在升到半中的時候從繩子脫了出來，而滑下跌死在甲板上了；可是薩克思多夫强迫其餘的人，而使他們固守在他們的位置上。在前帆和主帆扯了起來的時候，我吿訴他把繫住　錨的繩索弄斷，而讓船解開來。我讓我自己到了船尾的舵輪那裏去，而打算操舵使她前行。我猜不透他怎麼弄的，他不但沒有弄斷那繩索，却反而把第二只鐵錨放了下去，而使我們雙倍地下錨停泊着了。</p>
<p>「到最後他才好容易把兩根繩索都弄斷了，而扯起了支索帆和頭帆，而公爵夫人號就這樣上了她的道。我們的甲板上眞是一個奇觀。死了的與將死的黑人到處都是，他們有幾個被打中在最不可想像的地方。我呌薩克思多夫和他的墓塲的一羣把他們舉起來，而從船舷上面把他們丟出去，將死的以及死人的。那天鯊魚可有一頓飽餐了。自然我們的四個被殺死了的永手也同樣處理。然而他們的頭我們放在一只蔴袋裏，還進了一些沉重的東西，使得它們不致於漂流到岸邊。而落進了黑人的手中去。</p>
<p>「我們的五個俘虜我決定了用來做船員，可是他們決定了相反的方面。他們等到了他們的機會就從船旁跳了出去。薩克思多夫用他的手槍在半空中打中兩個，而還有三個，要不是我阻止了他的話，他也會已打死在水裏的。我是屠殺得有些厭煩了，你們明白，而且，還有，他們是帮同着使船開出了的。可是這種慈心是白費的，因爲鯊魚把他們三個統統吞吃了。』</p>
<p>『我們是望不見陸地了，我的頭裏却有些發燒。無論如何，公爵夫人號一直走了三個星期，我才使我自己振作了一些，然後我們使她緩緩走到了愁德尼。無論如何那些馬琉的黑人學得了一稱永久的敎訓，就是愚弄一個白人是沒有什麼好處的。在這一件事情上看來，薩克思多夫實在是不可避免的。』</p>
<p>査理羅伯次吹了一聲長口哨，然後說：</p>
<p>「不錯，我該說是這樣。可是薩克思多夫怎樣了呢？』</p>
<p>『他加入了捕海豹的船隻，而變成了一個著名的能手。有六個年頭他在維克多利亞和聖佛蘭西斯科二城的航海界有着很高的聲名。第七年他的縱帆船在白令海爲一艘俄國巡洋艦所捕，而所有的人手，據流行的傳說，都被關進了西比利亞的鹽鑛中去。至少我從此以後從沒有聽到過他」</p>
<p>「開墾世界，」羅伯次喃喃着。「開墾世界。不錯，這裏是給他們的。總有什麽人必得這樣做的，開墾世界，我意思。」</p>
<p>伍德華德船長摸摸他秃頂上的縱橫交錯的創瘢。</p>
<p>「我已做過我的一分了，」他說。「到現在四十年。這一次會是我最後一次的航行了。然後我要到家裏去住下來了。」</p>
<p>「我肯拿這酒打賭你不會，」羅伯次挑戰。你會死在勞動中，並不在家裏。」</p>
<p>伍德華德船長立刻接受了這個打貽，可是，在我個人，我想査理羅伯次是會贏了它的。</p>
<h3>救救老人</h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>有人輕輕叩我們的門，開出去）看，是隔壁某機關的看門老伯伯，見了我父親，滿臉愁容地說：「先生請你帮帮忙，我的飯碗掉了！」父親問他怎麽會掉了，他說：「他們嫌我老了，做事不靈敏，就不要我了！」。</p>
<p>朋友張君偶而來談談，談起他所服務的醫院近况，說最近醫院中裁去一批六十歲以上的職員，因此輩年高的人，非但體力减退，頭腦和思想也大都陳舊落伍，不適宜於工作了。</p>
<p>一位失業好久的老師，託教去向某校長情商，可吾給他安揷一個位置，起先某校長一口答應，但一問那老師的年齡，立刻搖頭說：「太老了，不興！」</p>
<p>「人老珠黃不値錢，」眞可憐的老人呀！</p>
<p>常常聽到「救救孩子」「救救下一代」的呼聲。不錯，孩子是國家未來的主人翁，下一代是社會的命脈，應該重視，應該用全副力量去愛護。然而，那曾經做過國家主人翁，曾經做過社會命脈的「上一代」，因爲老了，不中用了，大家就都摒棄他們了。</p>
<p>與其說是個社會問題，還不如說是個良心問題吧？</p>
<p>救救老人！</p>
<h3>雙宿雙飛（三二）</h3>
<p>— 趙淸閣</p>
<p>孩子羣中，只有麗雲還依然不失其大眞單純的本性。雖然她比她的同伴們更孤苦，但她的印象裏，父親旣沒有給過她什麽教育，母親也沒有給過她什麽慈愛！她好像是一株生長在大自然原野上的小草，她不曾享受過半點人爲的恩澤。所以當她的父母離開了她，又被墨太太收留以後，她便把墨太太視作她的生母一般，她很泰然而習慣地安於這個新環境。特別是有　華爲伴，她感覺到莫大的幸福。她一點也不想念她的父母，她對於父母的感情很淡薄。她似無感情；有，也極漂浮，散漫；於是，她便少許多的苦惱！</p>
<p>墨太太治家的本領相富大，半年以來，過得很舒展。墨老爺的後事，自然是潦潦草草地辦了，所以不但沒有化費墨太太什麼錢，而且墨老爺的死，又節省了墨太太一筆經常酒飯的開消。</p>
<p>頭半年，墨太太忙於家事，倒也不覺得寂寞。半年以後，墨太太的家事，漸漸就了緒，她便漸漸感到苦悶了。雖也常常去和隣居們打打麻雀消遣消遣。可這究竟不能佔據她全部的時間。一空下來，她便會不耐煩得坐臥不安。荆州維新大舞台又來了一班京戲、但翁二太太不在這裏，她一個人懂怠去看。爲了這原故，她近來特別想念翁二太太。翁二太太到了北京，曾經寄過一封問候信給她。她也回給翁二太太」封信，回信上一併報了兩件喪事：一件是翁老爺的自盡，一件是墨老爺的病故。這封信是寳鈴代筆寫的。由墨太太說一句，寳鈴就照寫一句。墨太太啡寳鈴吿訴翁二太太說：「她們老姊妹眞是同命人，常初離開北京，是一樣的情形；後來住在荆州，又是一樣的情形；如今各向的丈夫都死了，也不的而同起來。」說到這兒，墨太太看見寳鈴有點不高興，於是只好住了口。同時心裏却想着：「翁二太太又有了新丈夫，她比從前應當快活了。而自己旣沒有了舊丈夫，也沒有新丈夫，反倒不及從前了。」一陣難過，不禁嘆了口氣。寶鈴把信寫好，其實他已經把墨太太的話，打了個折扣，並沒有完全照着墨太太的意思去寫。但當墨太太呌他念的時候，寳鈴還是一五一十地照着墨太太的原句如誦給她聽了。墨太太便滿意地付了郵。</p>

<p>— 蕭亢石</p>
<p>昨晤知友林君文儀，談及彼之故鄕（潮陽）自入春以來，天不作雨，早稻不能佈種，米糧發生恐慌，而南洋方面亦以交通尙未恢復，米源吿絕，以致半月前之米價，每斗需八千元左右，而其他物價亦隨之飛騰。綜計潮陽一縣，達八百鄕村，餓殍載道，甚至賣十易米，棄女郊外、厥狀之慘，非言可喩！因念滬地尙有盟邦救濟品源源而來，米價等竟狂躍不已，何况潮陽位於鄕僻，絕無救濟物品，以資援助，來日方長，危殆愈甚。旅滬潮人，不乏富有，當能爲自己鄕梓沣想，予以金錢及物質上之救濟，不使災情擴大，則刧後餘生，不再爲旱魃所噬；亦爲人類應盡之義務，何况誼　桑梓？林君言下不勝悽切，以人微言輕，泣吿筆者、爲文刊於申報，作將伯之呼，敢爲潮陽全縣乞賑，尙祈旅滬同鄕亟起爲桑梓救濟，則不勝　　禱祝者也。</p>

Upon arriving at the airport, heads of various agencies were already standing by to see the Chairman off. The Chairman repeatedly expressed his thanks and then boarded the "Meiling" plane to fly to Hankou.</p>
<h3>Zhou Enlai Visits Xu Yongchang to Discuss the Military Situation in Central China, Talks for Two Hours to Prevent Escalation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Chongqing Dispatch: Zhou Enlai, upon receiving a telegram from Yan'an, is paying close attention to the development of the Zhongyuan (Central Plains) incident. Therefore, he postponed his trip to Nanjing on the 2nd. Zhou visited government representative Xu Yongchang last night at 8:00 PM to probe the government's attitude towards the movements of the Communist forces in the Central Plains. At that time, Xu immediately asked Zhou to telegram Wang Zhen, commander of the Communist Central Plains Military Region, to remain in place and not to act rashly to avoid escalating the situation and causing further suffering to the people. He also promised to immediately telegraph the Xi'an Headquarters for instructions. It is noted that two months ago, the Communist Central Plains Army, through the Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation Commission, convened a ceasefire agreement in Hankou, inviting the national army representative General Guo Chan and the communist small Central Plains Army Commander Wang Zhen. The Wuhan Headquarters advanced 10 million yuan to the Central Plains Communist Army to purchase food to avoid disturbing the people. After receiving the funds, the Communist Army did not purchase food and continued to forcibly requisition it from the people, and constantly used the excuse of food shortages to move to Wuhe, constantly making disturbances. The sudden outbreak of war this time is also due to this. According to a certain important official who flew from Hankou to Nanjing yesterday, the Central Plains Communist Army is now eager to move towards the railway lines. Their intention is to coordinate with the activities of the Communist Army in the Hebei-Henan border area, because the main force of the Communist Army originally stationed in the Hebei-Henan border area had already left customs in succession a month ago to increase the armed forces of the Northeast Communist Army.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 2nd] Zhou Enlai met with General Xu Yongchang last night at 10:00 PM and held an important meeting that lasted two hours, and suggested that an American observer should inspect Xuanhuaidian. General Xu Yongchang agreed to forward this suggestion to Chairman Chiang. Zhou Enlai telegraphed General Marshall the results of his conversation with Xu Yongchang and asked him to find a way to prevent the situation from deteriorating further. Marshall had dispatched a special plane to pick up Zhou Enlai to Beijing, but was unable to land in Chongqing due to poor weather. Xu Yongchang and other important personnel will go to Beijing on the 3rd. After Xu Yongchang arrives in Beijing, it is expected that the Military Three-Man Team will be established soon.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] According to a certain important official who recently arrived in Beijing, small-scale conflicts have occurred frequently in the coastal areas of northern Jiangsu and along the canal in the past month. The reason is the communist army's ambush. If the communist army's actions do not affect the security of Tongyang, a large-scale war should be avoided. It is heard that the military defenses in Nantong, Yangzhou, Jingjiang, and Taixian are still in need of strengthening. As for the details of the conflict in central Hubei, Beijing has not yet received a report, but the Wuhan Headquarters and the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters have telegraphed Beijing. They are convinced that the war in that area will not escalate, because the government has never authorized any national army troops to attack the communist army. The so-called "general offensive" ordered by the national army is either for other purposes or a dream.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun, Acting Director of the Chongqing Headquarters, Sworn Into Office</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] The Chongqing Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission was officially established in Chongqing on May 1st.

Additionally, it is reported that Xiao Yisu is the Chief of Staff of the Chongqing Headquarters, and Liu Shoupeng is the Secretary-General.</p>
<h3>Wang Dongyuan Inspects Disaster Situation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changsha, 1st] Chairman Wang Dongyuan is scheduled to go to southern Hunan on the 2nd to inspect the disaster situation. Deputy Director Yao Xuehuai and Chief Liu Xuru will accompany him.</p>

<h3>Suggestions for Resolving the Northeast Problem are Being Considered by the Government and the CCP; Shao Lizi and Lu Dingyi Have Also Met for Discussions</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 2nd] Marshall's suggestions, presented in the form of a memorandum, for resolving the Northeast problem are currently being considered by the government and the CCP. Marshall seems to want to give both sides ample time for careful consideration of this major issue. It is heard that Marshall has expressed to social dignitaries of the third party that he deeply hopes that the government and the CCP can directly discuss an outline of this issue, and then the three-person meeting will make a formal decision, but before Marshal left Chongqing, the three-person meeting of Xu Yongchang, Zhou Enlai, and Marshall has not yet been held. According to sources concerned, Marshall's suggestion focuses on stopping the conflict. On military issues, he advocates that military mobilization and troop reorganization should be decided by the three-person meeting. The political suggestions are all "original principles" and not specific.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 2nd] Since the consultation of the Political Consultative Conference's Comprehensive Group has been stalled, the overall situation in the Northeast has become increasingly tense. Government representative Shao Lizi again held consultations with Lu Dingyi at 10:00 PM last night. Zhou Enlai did not attend. The two sides proposed three suggestions: (1) The ceasefire order should take effect immediately, (2) The Dongshan Political Committee should be reorganized, (3) The Communist Party should withdraw from Changchun, but neither side should station troops there. The suggestion of not stationing troops in Changchun was not approved by the government.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 2nd] According to reliable news from Shenyang, Niu Xianming, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Military Mediation Department on the government side in Shenyang, proposed that the Military Mediation Department send a team to Changchun, Harbin, Qiqihar, and Suizhong. The US has expressed its agreement to this, but it has not yet been agreed upon due to the CCP's opposition. It is rumored that the government's representatives on the Northeast team sent by the Military Mediation Department will be changed. Colonel Cai Zonglian may serve as the leader of the government side. Given the current situation, it is necessary to wait for the Military Three-Man Team to negotiate a comprehensive solution to the Northeast issue before a decision can be made. Deputy Chief of Staff Niu has unfinished work in Shenyang and will not be able to return to Beiping in the short term. [United Press, Beiping, 2nd] According to news from Shenyang today, Yang Chuoan, the mayor of Harbin, has arrived in Vladivostok and is currently returning to the country via Japan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd] The transportation authorities officially took over the Yamato Hotel yesterday and renamed it the Shenyang Railway Hotel. The Yamato Hotel is a magnificent building that belonged to the old South Manchuria Railway and has a history of forty years.</p>
<h3>The Beijing Municipal Government Prepares Spacious Housing to Accommodate the CCP Delegation; Housing and Cars Valued at Approximately 200 Million Yuan</h3>

They are also preparing eleven Western-style houses with gardens and sanitary facilities at No. 30 of the same village to accommodate Zhou Enlai and his wife, Deng Yingchao. According to current market prices, the cost of the above two houses is estimated to be 114.6 million yuan, plus the cost of repairing and furnishing the furniture, as well as two cars required by the CCP representative Long Feihu, for a total value of approximately 200 million yuan. Additionally, the Youth Party has found housing at No. 24 of Jingfengtou Village, and the Democratic League's housing can be decided on the 3rd.</p>

<h3>Important Officials of Various Agencies Remaining in Chongqing Will All Return to the Capital Before the End of the Month; Song Ziwen, Zhang Lisheng, and Others Arrived in Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] After the formal promulgation of the order to return to the capital, important officials of various central agencies remaining in Chongqing will all return to the capital before the end of May, so that the government's various tasks can be fully launched in Nanjing. The return of family members of officials of various central agencies remaining in Chongqing and the return of righteous people who have been displaced to the rear for eight years should also be actively launched. Therefore, transportation for returning to the capital and returning home in mid-May will inevitably be extremely crowded. To this end, the responsible authorities have formulated a transportation plan for May. In terms of water transportation, due to rising water levels, the Ship Allocation Committee has requested the Ministry of Transportation to quickly allocate more ships to Chongqing. It is estimated that at least 10,000 people should be transported by water in May. In terms of land transportation, approximately 20,000 people should be transported in May. In terms of air transportation, it is estimated that the number of people to be transported by China and Central Airlines should be over 7,000, and military transportation should be reduced as much as possible in May.</p>

<h3>End of the First Phase of Army Reorganization; Training Proceeding as Planned; Bai Chongxi Discusses Army Reorganization in Various Locations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 1st] Vice Chief of General Staff Bai Chongxi, when meeting with reporters in this city, answered several questions posed by the reporters. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>(Question) Can you tell us about the mission of Mr. Bai on this trip? (Answer) This trip to Shaanxi is under orders to inspect the army reorganization and training situation, and to investigate military school education.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the situation of army reorganization and training in various locations that Mr. Bai has inspected this time? (Answer) This trip passed through Bengbu, Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Xinxiang, and arrived in Xi'an. Military leaders in various locations have been able to follow the army reorganization procedures and proceed smoothly. By the end of April, the first phase of army reorganization work has been completed. Training work is also proceeding according to plan. All surplus officers and soldiers have been properly resettled, and it is ensured that their livelihood will not be a concern.</p>
<p>(Question) The militarization of families is a concern, and the government has explicitly ordered a nationwide army reorganization. The government army is currently being reorganized in phases. What is the situation with the reorganization of the Communist army? (Answer) I have not heard anything about it.</p>
<p>(Question) After the ceasefire agreement, the restoration of transportation is a matter of concern for all compatriots. When Mr. Bai arrived in Xuzhou, was the Longhai Railway able to reach Haizhou? (Answer) The Longhai Railway from Xuzhou to Zhengzhou has resumed operation. Although the section from Xuzhou to Haizhou has been repaired, formal operation has not yet been agreed to by the Communist army. This section is currently managed by the Communist army. (Question) Conflicts between the Kuomintang and the Communists are still heard from time to time in various parts of China. Can these conflicts be completely stopped in accordance with the ceasefire agreement soon? (Answer) Conflicts in various parts of China are all local, such as Nantong and Caolou, where the Communist army attacked us first. (Question) The Northeast problem has become more serious since the withdrawal of the Soviet army. How will the government handle this? (Answer) Regarding the Northeast problem, the government will carry out the takeover work in accordance with the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship after the Soviet army withdraws, in order to ensure the integrity of territorial sovereignty, so that the compatriots in the Northeast can live and work in peace. (Question) Can the military conflict in the Northeast be stopped in the short term? (Answer) The Northeast problem is currently being discussed by Marshal Marshall with representatives of the government and the Communist Party to find a solution.</p>
<p>(Question) The National Assembly has now been postponed. Will the postponement be longer, or can it be expected to be convened in the short term? (Answer) The founding outline of the nation was created by the Premier of our party, and the President is continuing its completion. The process is divided into three stages: military administration, tutelage, and constitutionalism. For more than thirty years, we have overthrown the Manchu Qing, completed the Northern Expedition, and won the eight-year war against the invaders. According to the founding program, the tutelage should be ended immediately, constitutionalism should be implemented, and power should be returned to the people. The National Assembly should be convened as soon as possible. This postponement was announced because the list of representatives from various parties had not been submitted in time. But I believe this postponement will not be too long. I hope that the list of representatives from various parties will be submitted as soon as possible, and the date of convening the National Assembly will be reset, and the fundamental law of the country will be formulated so that the country can embark on the path of the rule of law as soon as possible. Mr. Bai will stay in Shaanxi for three days, inspecting troops and military school students.</p>
<p>Measures for the Resettlement of Demobilized Officers and Soldiers</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] Regarding the planning situation of the measures for the resettlement of demobilized officers and soldiers, a reporter recently interviewed Zhao Zhenyuan, who is in charge of the Government's Demobilized Officers and Soldiers Resettlement Planning Committee. The information is as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) What is the total number of demobilized officers and soldiers nationwide? (Answer) There are approximately 2.06 million demobilized officers and soldiers, including approximately 260,000 officers and approximately 1.8 million soldiers. They are demobilized in two phases.

Together with the surplus officers from the army reorganization last year, there are now more than 200,000 officers who have been accepted for training by various headquarters (brigades), and approximately 1.2 million soldiers.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the resettlement measures for demobilized officers and soldiers? (Answer) The resettlement measures are generally divided into three categories: (1) Transfer to other occupations, (2) Further education, and (3) Retirement (limited to those who have reached the age limit and are too weak to serve). In the first phase of demobilized officers, it is planned to transfer 30,000 to other occupations as a group, 150,000 individually, 10,000 for further education, and 10,000 for retirement. In the first phase of demobilized soldiers, 1.2 million will be transferred to other occupations as a group to engage in construction and production, with the goal of transforming consumption into production.

Regarding the formulation of transfer plans, the review and compilation of expense budgets, the formulation of examination methods, and various other important matters, the committee has worked with relevant ministries and commissions to formulate a complete plan, and it was approved at the third committee meeting. A Committee for the Examination of Officers for Transfer has been established, and examination areas have been designated, including seven locations: Beijing, Ping, Xi'an, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Zhengzhou. The examination will be conducted uniformly. The examination committee members for each test area have been assigned and are expected to depart for each test area in early May. It is expected that all classes will begin training in June. In short, in addition to handling all retirements for demobilized officers and soldiers, we have also decided on various vocational training programs in order to seek a livelihood for demobilized officers and soldiers and to develop national production and construction, so as to create healthy cadres for national construction.</p>

<h3>Our Earnest Desire for Peace; Safety is the Top Priority; Guo Taiqi's Broadcast on Expectations for the Security Council</h3>
<p>[US News Agency, New York, 1st] Dr. Guo Taiqi (see photo), Permanent Representative of China to the United Nations Security Council, recently made a radio broadcast to China, the gist of which is as follows: I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak with compatriots in China about the work of the United Nations Security Council. China has held the presidency of the Security Council for the past few months. Now that my term as president has come to an end, I am very happy to have this opportunity to report to you my personal hopes for the Security Council.</p>
<h3>Relying on Collective Peace to Safeguard National Security</h3>
<p>As you all know, some of the issues submitted to the Security Council cannot be resolved immediately because the parties concerned cannot find a direct solution before submitting them to the Security Council. At the same time, the nature of these issues is sufficient to endanger international peace and security. In other words, the main task of the Security Council is to prevent any international situation or dispute from threatening the peace and security that we all want to maintain. Mankind's longing for peace and desire for security, and prevention of danger, did not begin after the end of the war. It was not until the end of the recent war that countries around the world realized that the prerequisite for world peace is to recognize the inseparability of peace and security. People have now realized that any divisible peace is a pseudo-peace and cannot last long. Mankind learned this lesson through painful experience. It is no wonder that today, regardless of the size of the country, all rely on collective peace to safeguard their security. The Security Council was established based on this kind of awareness and belief. From the meeting convened by the Preparatory Committee in London to today, the Committee of Experts has worked tirelessly to formulate and revise the rules of procedure. We sincerely hope that the work of this committee will be completed soon. At that time, the Security Council will have a more complete set of rules of procedure to follow when conducting discussions.</p>
<h3>How to Enhance Credibility is Our Current Problem</h3>
<p>Our current problem is how to strengthen the power of the Security Council and enhance its credibility. What we need is not a debating parliament, nor a propaganda forum, but an institution with the prestige and power necessary to safeguard world peace and security. As you all know, under the Security Council, there is a Military Staff Committee of the five major powers. This committee is also meeting in New York. The Chinese representative is General Shang Zhen, Chief of Staff of the National Government. The Chinese delegation includes our army commander Lieutenant General Sun Liren, Air Force Major General Mao Bangchu, and no less than 20 experts from our army, navy, and air force. The meetings of the Military Staff Committee are not open to the public and are purely for discussing concrete military issues. China is one of the five permanent members of the Security Council. Our impression of the permanent membership of the Security Council is that this permanent membership is not a privilege, but a special responsibility.</p>
<h3>World Peace and Security Depends on Cooperation of the Five Powers</h3>
<p>Today, world peace and security depends on the cooperation of the five major powers. We will have no peace and security if the five powers cannot unite. If the five powers cannot unite, the Security Council will lose its effectiveness. Finally, I would like to say a few words to explain China's attitude and policy towards the Security Council. We, the Chinese people, firmly believe that the original friends contained in the Charter coincide with the principles of national construction of our Republic. For this reason, when we participate in any discussion of the Council, we are guided by the spirit of the Charter. China has fought against aggression for thirteen years. Our desire for peace is stronger than that of any other country. At the same time, our national defense strength is not yet sufficient. Although our national borders and coastline are among the longest in the world, we lack sufficient naval, land, and air defense forces. Safety is our top priority. It is because our desire for national security coincides with the desire of other countries in the world for international security that we place the most ardent hope on the Security Council. At the same time, we are determined to cooperate fully to promote the increasing power and prestige of the Security Council.</p>
<h3>Students of Anhui College Demand Merger with Anhui University</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hefei, 1st] More than 1,000 students from Anhui College gathered and marched in the rain to the Provincial Government to petition. They expressed their opposition to the four resolutions of the Preparatory Meeting of National Anhui University and demanded: (1) National Anhui University should be based on Anhui College; (2) Reclaim the former site of Anhui University, as well as books and instruments; (3) Move to Anqing immediately. Chairman Li Pinxian and Director Wang Shaolun met with them separately. Regarding the first demand above, they stated that a decision would have to be made by the Ministry of Education. Regarding the second demand, they said that they had already started to handle it. Regarding the third demand, they said that they could consider proceeding with it. The petitioning students, except for more than ten representatives who remained, have all returned to school to attend classes. It is said that these ten or so representatives are also planning to go to Nanjing to petition the Ministry of Education again.</p>
<h3>The Grain Shortage in Guangzhou is Becoming More Serious; Rice Prices Soar, Breaking the 90,000 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 2nd] The food problem here is becoming increasingly serious, and more and more poor people are starving to death. Rice prices have risen even more sharply in the past two days, rising by more than 10,000 yuan per dan in one day. The current price of top-quality rice has broken the 90,000 yuan mark, and one hundred yuan can only buy a little more than one ounce. The authorities have convened emergency meetings for days to discuss solutions to this problem. Chairman Luo telegraphed the central government yesterday, requesting 2 billion yuan to handle emergency grain loans and relieve the province's grain shortage. In addition, the Relief Committee started distributing relief yesterday. Overseas Chinese in Siam donated 500 tons of rice, which is being distributed at various police stations every day, with each person receiving 18 jin of rice upon presentation of a ticket. However, the distribution of these rice tickets is too strict. Some families with several members only receive one ticket, or two families receive one ticket together, failing to achieve universal relief. City councilors raised this for discussion and unanimously passed a resolution requesting that the distribution period be extended. In addition, all sectors here are actively preparing to celebrate the National Government's return to the capital, scheduled to be held on May 5th at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 2nd] Fujian Province recently allocated 500,000 shi of grain as tax to support Guangdong and Taiwan Provinces, with 200,000 shi for Taiwan Province, which have been continuously shipped since last month. The Guangdong Provincial Government recently sent personnel here to negotiate the allocation and transportation of 300,000 shi, which will enter Guangdong from southwestern Fujian.</p>
<h3>Preparatory Meeting of National Assembly Passes Resolution; Telegraph Urges All Representatives to Come to Nanjing; Requests Continued Registration for Meeting on Schedule</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The preparatory meeting of the National Assembly continued its first meeting this morning. 231 representatives attended, and Ma Changxu, Chen Zifeng, He Bingru, Zhu Jingnong, Yang Yifeng, Zhang Jingyu, Su Cunpu, and others were elected as the temporary presidium. They discussed the constitution. At the time, there were two types of draft constitutions in the meeting hall, one printed with lead type and the other mimeographed. The lead-printed one advocated that the preparatory meeting should be limited to elected representatives, while the mimeographed one advocated that all representatives could participate.

<h3>Military Commission Stipulates the Age Limit for Active Duty of Officers</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st] The Military Commission, in view of the fact that the regulations on personnel in the army, navy, and air force only specify the age limit for service but do not have regulations on the age limit for active duty, resulting in a lack of flexibility in the retirement and deployment of military officers, has specially stipulated the age limit for active duty of military officers as follows: (1) First-Class Generals, 62 years old; (2) Second-Class Generals (with the rank of General), 60 years old; (3) Lieutenant Generals, 56 years old; (4) Major Generals, 50 years old; (5) Colonels, 46 years old; (6) Lieutenant Colonels, 44 years old; (7) Majors, 42 years old; (8) Captains, 40 years old; (9) Lieutenants, 38 years old; (10) Second Lieutenants, 36 years old; (11) Warrant Officers, 34 years old.

<h3>Implementation of the Savage Plan; Contract Signed with US Company; Yangtze River Three Gorges Project to Begin Soon</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan has recently signed a contract with the American Morrison-Knudsen Company to implement the Savage Plan for the Yangtze River Three Gorges Project. It is reported that the company will send engineers to China soon to conduct dam foundation drilling. In the future, it is planned to build a large-scale dam near Yichang. Its main functions are: (1) To prevent the dangers of the Three Gorges shoals, so that large ships from Shanghai and Chongqing can navigate directly; (2) To use the Yangtze River hydropower to generate electricity to meet industrial needs; (3) To irrigate farmland and promote water conservancy.</p>
<h3>Tanggu Seaport Project; Suggestions for Early Completion</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Du De, Chief Engineer of the Port Group of the Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan, and his party inspected the Tanggu Seaport and have completed their work and returned to Shanghai. They have also prepared a report suggesting to Group Leader Hou that the port construction plan be completed as soon as possible to meet the development needs of North China. The report stated: Tanggu Seaport was started in 1941 during the Japanese occupation period. Before the Japanese surrender, the important parts had not yet been completed. According to the original Japanese plan, it was planned to build breakwaters on both sides of the deep-water channel at the port entrance, extending approximately 7.5 miles into the sea, to protect the deep-water channel and allow large ships with a draft of 25 feet to enter and exit freely. After the port is built, the economic value, according to the Japanese estimates, is that it can initially absorb 2 million tons of imported goods per year. If the docks and loading and unloading equipment are improved, the imported goods can be doubled again. The ultimate goal is to improve the port to a capacity of 8 million tons of imported goods. At present, if we re-plan to build the port, we dare not have this extravagant hope before it is fully and satisfactorily completed. We were sent to inspect this time, and we deeply feel that it is necessary to actively build the port. The port is located in the prosperous area of the southeast, guarding the gateway to Peiping and Tianjin, and is located in an important location. The coal deposits in Shanxi and Hebei provinces can all be exported from here in the future, and the cost of building the port is far less than the huge losses encountered by seagoing vessels bypassing the Dagukou sandbar before the war. According to the current situation, the total cost of building the port is about US$23.5 million, and it can be completed in three years. During the construction period, seagoing vessels can still enter and exit freely, and transportation will not be interrupted. In addition, Chief Engineer Du De hopes that this project can be contracted to the American Morrison-Knudsen Company, and construction can be planned and started in the short term.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A Third Party Must Not Be Confused!</h3>
<p>The "Political Consultative Conference," being termed a "consultation," must involve several parties, at least two. Since the consultation has already yielded results, all parties participating in the consultation should exert utmost sincerity to implement them. If everyone could genuinely implement the "Political Consultative Conference" agreements, the ceasefire orders, and the military reorganization and unification plans, why would there be conflicts in the Northeast? Why would there be the Battle of Changchun? And why would there be the "expansion of conflicts in the Central Plains" as mentioned by Mr. Zhou Enlai? The crux of the matter is that one or both sides have failed to implement these agreed-upon measures. Therefore, those who advocate fairness and seek mediation must carefully investigate which side, and which individuals, are failing to implement them. Only by clarifying this point can one judge right from wrong and determine which side is undermining peace. This is common sense. As the saying goes, "The bystander sees the clearest." We common people are originally the masters of the country, and although now relegated to being bystanders as a third party, we must be clear-minded observers and must not regard ourselves as confused third parties.</p>
<p>However, ever since the Communist forces besieged Changchun, up to occupying Changchun, seizing Harbin, destroying the Beining Railway, and obstructing the smooth operation of traffic on the Ping-Shen Line, we have only heard some people calling for mediation and others shouting for everyone to stop fighting. Yet, despite everyone knowing who is provoking and who started the fighting, no one has directly pointed it out. This is why the Chinese Communist Party has been able to wantonly rebel. Since its establishment, the Executive Headquarters for Mediation has relied on the hard work of Allied soldiers, but has never effectively stopped the CCP's actions that violate the ceasefire agreement; this has only made the CCP more arrogant and reckless. In short, the more the third party acts deaf and dumb and plays the fool, the more unscrupulous the CCP becomes in violating agreements.</p>
<p>Now we should wake up! On the eve of his departure from Chongqing, Special Envoy Marshall, who is tasked with mediation, offered the following advice to the CCP: "At this time, the Communist forces in Changchun should first withdraw and hand over the defense to the Central Army, and then discuss other issues." This is extremely simple, extremely straightforward, and extremely clear! The Northeast was originally not within the scope of military mediation, and the Central Government's acceptance of mediation, as long as it did not hinder the National Army's work of taking over administrative sovereignty, could already be considered the height of benevolence and righteousness. The Communist forces' launching of the siege of Changchun is clearly a breach of agreement, a betrayal of trust, and a violation of the agreement. If a third party, when advocating mediation and discussing right and wrong, fails to rectify such obvious and significant violations of the agreement, but instead confusedly accommodates reality and only hopes to muddle through, the result will inevitably be that where one crack is patched, another will appear. The matter today is very simple: those who violate the agreement must be subjected to condemnation from both domestic and foreign sources, so that they understand that there is no benefit in violating the agreement, and that they must start anew in accordance with the agreement. Only then can we hope that the overall situation of the country can truly achieve peace. Special Envoy Marshall's advice on the eve of his departure from Chongqing is the minimum demand on the CCP!</p>
<p>Please everyone take note: The CCP not only forcibly occupies Changchun and Harbin in the Northeast, but also has launched offensives in various places within the customs. The tension in the situation in northern Jiangsu, the surprise attack on the outskirts of Nantong, the complete cessation of railway repair work on all lines in Shandong, the attacks suffered by Licheng, Yanzhou, Gaomi, and Weixian, and even sporadic surprise attacks and disturbances in the suburbs of Beiping and Tianjin, all reveal how the Communist Party has recently been violating ceasefire orders and overthrowing the "Political Consultative Conference" agreements. At this very moment, CCP spokespersons are also spreading rumors in Yan'an, even going so far as to set up strange radio stations, falsely impersonating the broadcasts of Nanjing and Kunming radio stations to confuse the public. Furthermore, Mr. Zhou Enlai deliberately claims that the conflicts in the Central Plains are expanding, fabricating many reports that the Communist forces in Hunan and Hubei have been besieged by the National Army. This further proves that, as of today, the CCP's preparations for a full-scale rebellion are nearing completion. To put it bluntly: The one who does not want peace today, but wants to seize political power by force, or at least wants to establish a separatist regime by force, is the Chinese Communist Party. We common people, even if relegated to being a third party, must not stand idly by and must not allow ourselves to merely call for peace in a confused manner. It must be known that today's China is not Shanghai during the Qi-Zhi War of the thirteenth year of the Republic of China. We fought the eight-year War of Resistance, shed immeasurable blood, and poured immeasurable sweat. We must preserve the fruits of this victory. Whoever destroys these fruits of victory is the public enemy of the entire nation!</p>
<p>"Consultation" involves both sides and multiple parties. Today, the agreements of the Political Consultative Conference have been completely torn up by the Communist Party. Have the gentlemen who participated in the consultation heard or seen nothing? The agreement to convene the National Assembly on May 5th has been postponed due to the Communist Party's failure to submit a list of nominees. The expansion and reorganization of the National Government has also been indefinitely shelved due to the Communist Party's failure to submit a list of National Government members and its forceful demand for seats. The major task of formulating a constitution has also been forced to be delayed due to the postponement of the National Assembly. The reorganization and unification of the military has been indefinitely delayed because the Communist Party has not yet submitted the serial numbers of its reduced units. The administrative sovereignty of the Northeast, according to the agreement, was originally the responsibility of the National Government to take over, and the CCP was not allowed to obstruct it. Now, it has been obstructed by the Communist forces' occupation of Changchun. Orders for the cessation of military conflicts in various places have long been issued, but in the past two months, due to the CCP's reckless actions, it has continued to attack the National Army everywhere, and the hope for peace is hanging by a thread. In short, the CCP speaks of peace but in reality, it is fighting. But it is only allowed to attack others, and no one is allowed to fight back! When the CCP wants to attack someone, it must first shout that someone is going to attack it; when the CCP is attacking someone, it must refuse mediation; when the CCP has fought well and seized territory, it must shout for a ceasefire, so that the other party cannot fight back. After it has rested for some time, and its strength has been reorganized, it can fight again, and then it will first shout that someone is going to attack it, in order to repeat its signature all-out brawl. This is the CCP's wishful thinking, and today, the peace-loving people of China and the well-meaning allies who seek mediation are being deceived by the CCP's trickery. We must now loudly proclaim: If the third party truly wants lasting peace, it must wake up, stop playing the fool, and stop being deceived by the CCP!</p>

<h3>Foreign Ministers' Conference Enters Second Week – Devoted to Peace Treaty Discussions – Disagreements Continue to Arise Between the US and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, Second Broadcast: The Four Foreign Ministers had new "disagreements" again today, but fortunately, due to the continuous emergence of "disagreements," a simplified discussion procedure has been discovered, which will provide many conveniences for future negotiations. Today's disagreement was about the management of Italian prisoners of war. After Molotov routinely opposed the US proposal, the French Foreign Minister immediately stood up and said: "Since the opening of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, no agreement has been reached, and disagreements have emerged one after another. In the future, the discussion method should be improved. Formal meetings should be changed to informal talks, held once a day. The first meeting will be held today in the office of the British Foreign Secretary."</p>
<p>[United Press Paris Second Telegram] The four foreign ministers are stepping up their efforts today to seek an agreement on the peace treaty with Italy, and have placed the discussion of the Dalmatian Islands and the handling of war criminals at the top of today's agenda. The four foreign ministers are scheduled to hold two meetings today and will try their best to clear up the points of disagreement as much as possible so that they can concentrate on listening to the opinions of Yugoslav and Italian experts on the Istrian border and the Trieste issue between the two countries at the meeting the day after tomorrow. According to US sources, the foreign ministers secretly decided last night to include the Dalmatian Islands and war criminals on today's agenda, but it was not stated who the war criminals were. Well-informed observers expect that the Foreign Ministers' Conference, which has now entered its second week, will devote itself to discussing the peace treaties with Italy and the Balkan countries, and that the negotiations on the peace treaties with the Balkan countries will continue into the third week, perhaps the majority of the last week, will study the German issue. Regarding the Italian colonies, especially Libya, the foreign ministers' opinions still differ greatly. The British side advocates Libyan independence, the French side proposes entrusting Italy to manage it, the United States agrees to entrust the United Nations to manage it, and the Soviet Union proposes a plan, advocating that the Italian colonies be entrusted to one of the countries, assisted by Italy, for joint management. (Note: The Dalmatian Islands are located on the east coast of the Adriatic Sea.)</p>
<h3>US Suggestion to Establish Control Committee for Italy Opposed by Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Reuters Paris Second Telegram] During yesterday's discussion at the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference on the issue of appointing an Allied Control Committee to monitor Italy's implementation of the treaty, Byrnes and Molotov had a dispute, and a final agreement could not be reached. Afterward, the entire Italian issue was reviewed, and the agenda for today's meeting was selected. Byrnes suggested establishing a Four-Nation Control Committee to supervise the general implementation of the Italian Peace Treaty, not limited to military terms. This was discussed at the London Foreign Ministers' Conference in September last year, but Molotov believed that this move would harm Italian sovereignty and was not feasible. Byrnes also said that after the establishment of this institution, Italy could be exempted from accusations from any individual country. British representative Bevin agreed with Byrnes's proposal, and France did not take a definite stand, but said that it agreed in principle to the establishment of an Allied Control Committee. After Molotov protested, Byrnes proposed adopting the principles of the London Conference in September last year, namely that the Control Committee would only be responsible for supervising the implementation of military terms, but Molotov still opposed it. It is generally speculated that Molotov's intention is to prevent the establishment of similar committees in Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary.</p>

<h3>US Starts "Closing Down" Bases Everywhere</h3>
<p>[United Washington Second Telegram] The United States has now started "closing down" bases everywhere in the world.

However, Okinawa Island is an ideal air base in the East, and Saipan Island and Tinian Island will not be returned to Japan. As for other bases such as the Caroline Islands, Lyziki Island, and Wake Island, the US Navy hopes to maintain them.</p>

Bidault explained France's urgent economic needs for three hours. Byrnes then discussed it with President Truman by long-distance telephone, expressing his agreement with the economic demands put forward by France. At the same time, Bidault also spoke with President Truman, who provided guarantees for both lending to France and supplying France with supplies. It is reported that the French government recently cabled Washington, stating that France needs 500,000 tons of American wheat before this year's harvest.</p>
<h3>This Year's Second Quarter UNRRA Rice Allocation May Reach 100,000 Tons</h3>

The distribution is presided over by the UNRRA.</p>
<h3>Throughout Palestine – General Strike Launched Today to Protest the British-American Investigation Report – British Troops Greatly Increased to Prevent Turmoil</h3>
<p>[Reuters Jerusalem Second Telegram] The Arab Higher Committee of Palestine notified the Arab tribes throughout Palestine to hold a general strike for one day on Friday to protest the report of the British-American investigation team. At the same time, it also telegraphed the neighboring Arab countries to launch a sympathy strike on that day. Since the publication of the British-American investigation report, neither the Jewish nor the Arab tribes have expressed satisfaction. The Jewish tribe is most disappointed that the establishment of a Jewish state is not allowed. The Arab tribe has always opposed Jewish immigration. The report suggests immigrating 100,000 Jews this year, which makes them very angry, and allowing Jews to buy land is also a major blow to the Arab tribe. There is no sign of unusual tension on the surface here, but it is known that many British troops have entered Palestine. Some people estimate that the number of British troops in Palestine has reached as many as 100,000, with the main force in the Jewish area in the north. If the Arab tribe expresses armed resistance, these areas will be the target. It is still unknown whether the British troops came here to prevent turmoil or as an occasional gathering, but it can be said to be a coincidence in this time. The security in this city is also very tight, with armored vehicles carrying machine guns and searchlights patrolling the streets day and night.</p>

The government now recognizes that this matter is extremely urgent. However, fulfilling the terms in the report will become a major task, so the British government hopes to find out how much responsibility the US government can share in military and economic terms, and then make a decision as soon as possible. It is deeply hoped that Jewish and Arab leaders can be patient.</p>
<p>[United Washington First Telegram] The US Prime Minister advocated that the United States provide military and financial assistance to prevent disturbances in Palestine, but the US Congress expressed opposition.

<h3>Germany Laments Many Unmarried Women; Marriage Advertisements Offer a Wide Spectacle; Some Even Refer to Themselves as "Dark Beauties"</h3>
<p>[United Press, Frankfurt, Germany, 1st] The marriage market in Germany is currently quite lively. In Frankfurt, many places where advertisements are posted have announcements for selling goods on one side and marriage proposals from single men and women on the other. Some newspapers' classified ad sections are also filled with these small marriage announcements. Due to the large number of men who died in the recent war, there is a phenomenon of more women than men in Germany. In the American occupation zone, among Germans aged 19 to 45, there is only one man for every four women. Because there are more women than men, most of the people posting marriage advertisements are women. However, the number of men seeking marriage is increasing day by day, as more Germans are released from prisoner-of-war camps and want to start a new life. People of all ages are seeking marriage, from young women not yet twenty years old to elderly men and women in their sixties. Many women became widows at a young age because of the war. Women's marriage advertisements often emphasize that they have housing and furniture, as these are not easy to obtain in Germany. A 29-year-old widow referred to herself as a "dark beauty" in her marriage advertisement and specifically stated that she owned furniture. Another 40-year-old widow claimed to be "good-looking" and have a very beautiful 19-year-old son, and added that she had a house and garden in Oberden. Many women declared themselves very healthy in their advertisements, placing appearance in a secondary position. Even women ten years older stated: "Intelligent and lively, willing to be paired with a partner of appropriate age." Men's advertisements are not as verbose as women's, but some specifically stated "I am not a member of the National Socialist Party."</p>

<h3>Twenty-Six War Criminals to be Interrogated This Morning; Hideki Tojo Still Trying to Quibble; Shigenori Togo Escorted to Prison</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 1st] Chief Prosecutor Joseph B. Keenan of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East announced today: Japanese war criminals Tojo and 25 others will be indicted for inciting war and aggression and will be arraigned at 10:30 AM on the 3rd. However, Iitagaki and Kimura are being escorted from Bangkok to Japan and will not be included in the indictment of Tojo and others, but will be tried separately later. The two criminals are currently en route and are expected to arrive in Tokyo within days.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, from United Press] Former Foreign Minister Togo, after being certified by the American military doctor as capable of enduring prison life, was imprisoned on the night of the 1st.</p>
<h3>Watch How Tojo Defends Himself</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 2nd] Hideki Tojo, the instigator of the Japanese war, broke his long silence today, stating that his defense will declare the entire history related to his personal involvement in this war, and may verbally criticize the actions of the UK and the US before the war. It is said: "I will proclaim to the world that this war was Japan's war of self-defense." Tojo will appear in court tomorrow as the head of the "militarist warlords" to be tried for various charges, from individual murder to conspiracy to dominate the world.</p>
<p>Tojo issued a written statement to a United Press reporter, outlining his intended defense points as follows:</p>
<p>Proclaiming Aggression as Self-Defense</p>
<p>(First) Japan is an independent country, and given the situation in 1941, there was no other way but war for the sake of "self-defense." As for the question of when I believed that a war with the United Kingdom and the United States was inevitable, I will further elaborate in court. (Second) Japan "did not want to invade any Eastern country," but only to "liberate" them. As for the use of each country's resources and the implementation of various restrictions on the rights of the people, it was necessary for the prosecution of the war, but only for the duration of the war. (Third) In my position as Prime Minister, I hoped that the Washington negotiations in 1941 would be successful. All the orders I issued were conditional, that is, if the Washington Conference achieved success, these orders should be revoked. (Fourth) In my position as Prime Minister and concurrently Minister of the Army, I "in principle" agreed to withdraw troops from China. This was a major obstacle to the negotiations, but withdrawal could only be implemented under "certain conditions," one of which was a peace agreement with China.</p>
<p>Exposing the Inner Workings of the Military</p>
<p>Tojo also answered questions directly in a stern manner, saying that at the beginning of the war, "I naturally believed that Japan would win." Tojo's statement shows that he will dispute every charge with the prosecutor. Tojo also admitted that he opposed Japan's surrender, stating, "I expressed this view in the meeting of senior ministers, but did not take any action to prevent the surrender." However, his son-in-law, Major Koga, committed suicide by seppuku after initiating an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the Japanese Emperor from surrendering after the Potsdam Declaration. Tojo also stated that he would present in court the long-standing conflicts between the Japanese Army and Navy before the war. Regarding the question of whether Tojo would have changed his attitude if the entire Japanese Navy had resolutely opposed him in 1941, instead of just individual opposition, he will answer in court.</p>
<p>Still Wants to Live a Humiliating Life</p>
<p>Other Japanese people said that Tojo's appointment as Prime Minister in 1941 was a premeditated plan, but Tojo claimed, "I was very surprised when I received the imperial order to form a cabinet on October 10, 1941, but once I became Prime Minister, I had to do my best." Tojo, who both initiated the war and caused it to fail, believes that the outcome of the war is "regrettable." At this moment, he hopes that Japan can "revive under a new banner." He no longer intends to commit suicide and clearly stated in his answers that he will fight during the trial.</p>
<h3>Various Countries Celebrate Labor Day: Exaggerations, Disturbances, and Talk of War Vary Widely</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 1st] During the celebration of Labor Day in various European countries, exaggerations, disturbances, and talk of war varied widely.</p>
<p>Paris, Rome, Berlin, Moscow</p>
<p>In Paris, 500,000 French people marched, with banners proclaiming "Complete severance of relations with Franco" and attacking the current Spanish regime, calling Franco a "murderer of democracy."</p>
<p>Although Mussolini is dead, his fanatical followers briefly harassed the headquarters of the Communist Party in Rome and the Communist Party's socialist newspaper, and once "occupied" the Rome radio station, forcing it to broadcast Fascist songs.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of workers in Berlin marched through the ruins with red flags leading the way, without any militaristic overtones, but their bombastic speakers demanded support for "the only true socialism," reminding people of Hitler's crowd psychology.</p>
<p>All cities throughout the Soviet Union had grand celebrations, with the celebration ceremony on Moscow's Red Square being the most prominent. It gathered the largest peacetime force to boast military prowess. Premier Stalin and the crowd listened quietly to the speech of Soviet hero Marshal Rokossovsky, who said: "We should not be complacent. International reactionary forces have repeatedly raised their heads, plotting to undermine the cooperation of freedom-loving nations and struggle for peace and security." The British Labor Party stipulated that Labor Day would be officially commemorated on Sunday.</p>
<h3>Japanese Liberal and Socialist Parties Reach Compromise</h3>
<p>Hatoyama May Succeed as Prime Minister</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from our Tokyo correspondent, May 2nd] The outgoing Prime Minister will dispatch Foreign Minister Yoshida to meet with MacArthur within days, recommending Ichiro Hatoyama as the successor. If MacArthur accepts this recommendation, then Shidehara will pay respect to the Emperor and make the same recommendation.

<h3>Can the Foreign Ministers' Conference Resolve the Many Complex Problems in Europe?</h3>
<p>— Xueyan, Special Correspondent for This Newspaper in London</p>
<p>Although the end of the European war was nearly a year ago, sorting out the postwar mess and defining the future relationships between the defeated countries and other nations are still being explored, and the situation is still unclear. This cannot be blamed on the parties involved being negligent, but rather because the issues are too complex. With conflicting interests and differing opinions, no one is willing to compromise easily, so the issues are naturally not easy to resolve. Last September, the five major powers' foreign ministers met in London to discuss this matter, but the results of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference, as everyone knows, only resulted in heated arguments, and the results were almost equal to zero. Later, in December, there was the Moscow Conference of Three Foreign Ministers, which continued to discuss this matter. The transformation from a five-foreign-minister conference to a three-foreign-minister conference was itself a compromise. One of the main reasons for the London conference failing was the Soviet Union's opposition to China and France's participation. Indeed, China and France were not included in the Moscow conference, and no matter how the UK and the US explained it, Soviet diplomacy had achieved an actual preliminary victory. At the Moscow conference, regarding the European peace, it was decided that the foreign minister representatives of the countries participating in the establishment of the Foreign Ministers' Conference agreement in the Berlin conference would immediately draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland. After the draft peace treaties are completed, a peace conference will be convened to formally sign them. After the method of drafting the peace treaties was decided, the representatives of the four foreign ministers began working in London. As for how the progress, because each party was very secretive, outsiders do not know the details. However, the authorities of various countries occasionally express complaints, and some news is inevitably leaked. Generally speaking, the achievements of the four foreign ministers' representatives over the past three months are that there are more points of disagreement than points of agreement. Bernardes suggested that the foreign ministers of each country personally come forward again to hold a four-foreign-minister conference in Paris on April 25, hoping to resolve the disputes. This proposal was immediately approved by the UK, France, and the Soviet Union, so the Foreign Ministers' Conference was held in Paris as scheduled. However, whether the disputes of various parties can be resolved as planned, we cannot say too early. What are the points that the four major powers are unwilling to compromise on? Because the negotiations are in progress, all parties are keeping secrets, and it is difficult for us to know the details. However, by piecing together what has been directly and indirectly revealed by various parties, we can barely understand an outline. In the Foreign Ministers' Representatives Conference, the first thing discussed was the draft of the treaty clauses with Italy. For example, regarding how to solve the issue of Italian colonies, the UK originally advocated not negotiating for the time being. Later, due to opposition from various countries, it seemed to abandon its original proposal on its own initiative. The Soviet Union requested to hand over Tripolitania to the Soviet Union for trusteeship, which was strongly opposed by the UK and the US. As for France's attitude towards this, we have heard very little. Why did the UK advocate not negotiating for the time being? Because most of Italy's colonies are currently under British military occupation and are practically the same as British colonies. Others may have doubts about the British occupation and management, but the UK itself has no doubts or fears and is fully confident that occupying them for one more day will definitely not be a loss for the UK, so it advocated discussing it slowly, and delaying it as long as possible. Perhaps for this reason, various countries expressed opposition. Why did the Soviet Union request trusteeship of Tripolitania? Naturally, it was not because it liked to make trouble for itself. Trusteeship is a new system under the current United Nations organization, and how it will actually evolve in the future, we naturally cannot predict. However, the trusteeship system is derived from the mandate system of the League of Nations and has been improved. The achievements of the mandate system are readily available today. Not to mention the islands mandated to Japan in the Pacific, let's just talk about the territories mandated to the UK and France in South Africa. How different are they from colonies? It is also difficult to estimate. Therefore, we guess that the Soviet Union's request for trusteeship of Tripolitania has a mandate territory in mind first, or it will not be too wrong. As for why the UK and the US opposed it? As far as the UK is concerned, the Middle East and the Near East have always been considered the UK's transportation hub to the Far East and India. When the power of a strong country extends into this area, the UK identifies it as a competitor. Imperial Russia, France, and Italy have all successively or simultaneously competed with the UK in this area. Now the Soviet Union's power has penetrated the Balkans, infiltrated Iran, and is also demanding free access to the Dardanelles Strait. If it establishes a foundation in East Africa and unites into one, it is simply a threat to the heart of the British Empire, and opposition is natural. The Iranian issue has caused unrest among its neighbors, and this is also one of the main reasons. Although the issue of Tripolitania is silent, the UK's opposition is probably no less than that of the Iranian issue. The US has many theories about the trusteeship system, but there are few places in the world where it can put its ideals into practice. Now that it has discovered that Italy's colonies are still ownerless, it feels that it is an opportunity and advocates trying out "international co-management trusteeship" in Italy's colonies. Therefore, just from the issue of the disposal of Italian colonies, it can already be known how different the opinions of various parties are. There are even more complex issues.</p>
<p>Should Italy pay reparations? How much should it pay? How should it be allocated? These are all issues that the foreign ministers' representatives should resolve. The current policy of the UK and the US is to stabilize the situation in Europe and promote the economic recovery of various countries. Italy is not as terrible as Germany, but it is also one of the major European countries, so it attaches great importance to Italy's economic recovery. If Italy's economy can recover as soon as possible, then the demands for reparations from it should not be too harsh. The UK, the US, and France themselves seem to not demand reparations from Italy, but they believe that the Soviet Union's demand for one hundred million US dollars in in-kind reparations for its own country and two hundred million US dollars in in-kind reparations for Yugoslavia, Greece, and Albania is too harsh, hindering Italy's economic recovery, and they strongly oppose it. As for the disposal of the remaining Italian fleet, it is said that the Soviet Union demanded one-quarter, which was also opposed by the UK, the US, and France. Furthermore, regarding the future military equipment of Italy, how to restrict it, the opinions of various countries are also inconsistent. France has been invaded by strong neighbors several times, suffering greatly, and is most afraid of having strong neighbors around it. Therefore, regarding the issue of restricting Italian military equipment, it is said that France has the most opinions. In addition, France also demands some strategic locations on the Franco-Italian border to secure its defense. As for the disposal of places such as Trieste, it is currently awaiting the investigation report of the four-nation committee, but that is a long-standing dispute, and it is difficult to expect a perfect solution. Now, in the draft peace treaty, in addition to Italy, it is said that the issue of Hungary has been discussed. Hungary is now the Soviet Union's ally, and it signed a separate treaty with the Soviet Union last year. The UK once opposed it. Recently, the Hungarian Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and several other ministers went to the Soviet Union together and signed multiple treaties. Therefore, in the eyes of the Soviet Union, Hungary is no longer an enemy country. Moreover, any concessions made by Hungary to the UK, the US, and other countries directly or indirectly affect the Soviet Union's acquired interests. Therefore, it can be predicted that the Soviet Union will protect Hungary in the peace talks. The UK and the US have always believed that Bulgaria and Romania are not democratic enough and that the government should accommodate people from other parties. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, is very close to them because of similar ideologies, so it is unquestionable that the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union will have different views. The simplest is the treaty with Finland, because there are only the UK and the Soviet Union, and the issue is easy to resolve. It is said that there has been considerable progress in the discussions, which is the most successful part of the peace treaty draft discussions. From the above analysis, we know how complex the issue is and whether the four foreign ministers can completely resolve it. It is difficult to predict now. It is said that if it fails, the UK and the US are prepared to make peace separately with Italy and other countries. This is of course the last resort, a measure of last resort. I think that even if the UK and the US currently have this preparation, it is only for contingency purposes. Moreover, although there are many points of conflict, it is not completely impossible to compromise. Or, first choose the parts that can be compromised, draft a compromise proposal, and leave the parts that cannot be compromised to be resolved later. This may not be a solution, and from all aspects, it seems to be the most likely solution. (Sent from London on April 23)</p>

<p>Scum of the Journalism World</p>
<h3>Xu Liqun on Trial: Double Puppet, Confesses to Being Dragged in by Traitor Lin; Just a Mouthpiece</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Xu Liqun, a member of the Shanghai journalistic community who was once prominent during the enemy's occupation, began trial at the High Court yesterday morning at around 10 AM. Xu, as acting president of "Zhonghua Daily," the organ of traitor Wang Jingwei, published absurd remarks to confuse the people's consciousness. Yesterday, Judge Qiu Huan-ying opened the first court session for interrogation. Xu was short in stature, wearing a gray-black long gown, with glasses on his nose, a sullen face, and very slow movements, and his voice was low and stuttered. According to his confession, he was from Zhongshan, Guangdong, 43 years old this year, and lived at 1711 West Aisi Road. He joined "Zhonghua Daily" in 1932. After the newspaper defected, "for the sake of livelihood," he was dragged into it by the puppet propaganda minister Lin Baisheng. The presiding judge asked him: "Why did you publish so many absurd remarks?" Xu immediately admitted that he was a puppet and said: "All the newspaper's affairs were originally the responsibility of Lin Baisheng himself. All the remarks were sent directly from Nanjing. I was just nominally a mouthpiece. However, I wrote articles scolding Chen Binhe." The presiding judge asked: "Why did you attack each other when you were in the same camp?" He replied: "I fundamentally opposed Chen Binhe's absurd remarks. Originally, I was preparing to go to the mainland, but transportation was difficult, and I couldn't find any connections. I was afraid that I would be arrested by the government for having served in a puppet position, so I didn't go and could only scold Chen Binhe." He asked: "When did you attend the "Greater East Asia" News Association?" He replied: "In the winter of 1944." He asked: "You also served as the chief director of the puppet News Association?" He replied yes. He asked: "Who took over the puppet Zhonghua Daily?" He replied: "It was Wu Shao Shu of the City Party Department. However, one day after the victory, I published the 'Peace Extra'." The presiding judge said sternly: "Does publishing a 'Peace Extra' mean you are not a traitor? You are just quibbling!" Then he ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody, pending rescheduling for further interrogation. Xu did not retain a lawyer to defend him in this trial, and no family members were in court to listen.</p>
<p>Traitor Yang Zhiwei Still Trying to Evade Responsibility</p>
<p>The case of Yang Zhiwei was also tried. Yang was from Wuxi, 28 years old. In 1935, he studied in Japan. In July 1941, he took the exam for special agents at "No. 76" in Shanghai and was accepted as a translator. He was assigned to the Suzhou Office of the Puppet Qingxiang Committee as an assistant secretary. The following spring, he was promoted to a recommended secretary of the Puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government. In August 1943, he was transferred to the secretary of the Puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government's Construction Department and concurrently the deputy director of the Suzhou Office of the Puppet Rice Grain Control Committee. From January to April 1945, he served as a major staff officer of the Puppet Jiangsu Provincial Security Command and other puppet positions. After the victory, he was arrested and delivered to court by the Military Intelligence Bureau. When questioned yesterday morning, traitor Yang was still trying to evade responsibility, so the court ordered a rescheduling for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Kang Sidan Dingni Actually Claims to Have Assisted Our Underground Workers</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday morning, the Provisional Criminal Court of the High Court, presided over by Judge Qiu Huanying, opened the trial of Kang Sidan Dingni, an Italian fascist party member, for the crime of communicating with the enemy and endangering the country. The defendant hired lawyer Cai Xiaobai as his defense counsel. Surprisingly, he also confessed to having assisted our underground workers in their activities in Shanghai and contributed to our Republic of China. Judge Qiu, believing that the case required further investigation, ordered a postponement for further hearings. Kang Sidan Dingni, 45 years old, came to Shanghai in January 1930 and engaged in legal practice. He also held positions at the Italian Embassy in China twice. In 1941, he served as the political secretary of the Shanghai Fascist Party and was once an advisor to Wang Jingwei, a traitor, engaging exclusively in liaison with the Japanese invaders. Even after Italy's surrender, he continued to lead the Shanghai Fascist Party, building a Japanese-organized Fascist volunteer army to fight alongside the Japanese army. Unfortunately, his good dream did not last long, and he was arrested by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters after the victory. After a detailed investigation by Prosecutor Lin Wopeng of the High Procuratorate, eight charges were listed. However, Kang Sidan Dingni claimed that he had assisted the Central Government in establishing a secret radio station in Shanghai, and Mrs. Zhao Ziyou could testify to this. The veracity of this claim is still awaiting verification.</p>
<h3>Occupying Enemy Overseas Chinese Houses: Forced Eviction</h3>
<p>The Housing Allocation Committee for Shanghai Agencies under the Executive Yuan will actively launch a campaign of forced eviction against unscrupulous individuals who illegally occupied houses during the evacuation of enemy overseas Chinese. To prevent all malpractices, the committee has specially printed a five-part form for execution orders for use during enforcement. The execution work will officially commence within days. The five parts of the form are: the first part is the stub, the second part is the execution order, the third part is the execution report form, the fourth part is the opinion form signed by the subject of execution, and the fifth part is the execution notification.</p>
<h3>Measures for Handling Traitor Property Expected to be Decided Soon</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, trials of treason cases have been actively underway in various regions. However, there are still no clear measures on how to handle the property of traitors. Therefore, the reporter visited the responsible officials of the Enemy and Puppet Industry Management Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. I was informed that the number of traitor cases that have been definitively adjudicated is still small. The bureau has repeatedly consulted with the Shanghai High Court on the handling of traitor property. According to legal regulations, it should be handled by the court. However, since the bureau and the Ministry of Judicial Administration both belong to the national agencies under the Executive Yuan, and the courts have a limited staff, handling this huge amount of traitor property may be difficult in practice. Therefore, the solution to this problem will likely be one of the following three options: (1) handled by the court; (2) change the legal regulations and let the Enemy and Puppet Industry Management Bureau handle it, but this will take a long time and may be too late to be of any use; (3) the court entrusts the Enemy and Puppet Industry Management Bureau to handle it, or the court and the bureau jointly form an appropriate joint agency to be responsible for supervision. It is said that Bureau Director Liu has decided to ask President Song for instructions on the measures, and a decision will be made soon. As for the property of some unadjudicated suspected traitors, the bureau has followed President Song's instructions and entrusted the Central Bank to take care of the gold, silver, and jewelry, entrusted the Central Trust Bureau to take care of the real estate, and handed over the materials to the Customs to take care of them, all without any processing. If the court declares the suspected traitor innocent, the bureau will immediately return the property. Furthermore, the Enemy and Puppet Industry Management Bureau will be abolished in the short term, and the complete conclusion of the trial and adjudication of traitor cases may take a considerable amount of time. It is currently undecided how the traitor property section of the bureau will continue to work.</p>
<h3>Public Trial of Wu Songgao This Afternoon; Lin Kanghou and Others Have Also Been Indicted</h3>

<p>Yesterday, the High Procuratorate also questioned Chang Yuqing, the leader of the "An Qing Association", Dai Yingfu, the former head of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, and Huang Yuan, Zhou Wenrui, Ni Aifu, Shao Hongzhu, and Lin Yifu to investigate their crimes. Wu Songgao, who has served as the former Minister of Justice Administration and the former Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government, will be publicly tried at the Tilanqiao High Court at 3:00 PM today. In addition, the case of Liu Huizhai is also scheduled for trial today.</p>
<h3>Measures for Handling Materials in the Jiang Gongmei Case Have Been Decided</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The main points of the interrogation in the Jiang Gongmei case the day before yesterday included the embezzlement part, the dereliction of duty part, and the suspected crime part that is still under investigation. However, Jiang resolutely denied all points and shirked responsibility. In the dereliction of duty part, regarding the point that Jiang arrested criminals during his tenure and released them directly without transferring them to the court for handling according to law, his confession was vague. In addition, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters has decided on the handling of confiscated materials in the case. It is reported that those belonging to the public will be returned immediately, and those belonging to the private sector will be verified and handled. As for enemy and puppet materials, such as rice, flour, sugar, and fish, which are easily moldy, they will be publicly auctioned and preserved at a converted price.</p>
<h3>Glamourous Corpse Case: Main Suspect Transferred to Court</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The main suspect in the Glamourous Corpse case at Taishan Apartments, after being transferred by the police station to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for interrogation, was transferred to the local court for trial yesterday as an ordinary criminal.</p>
<h3>The Registered Amount of Puppet Currency in This City Reached 2.7 Billion Yuan; Handling Methods Are Still Awaiting Instructions from the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>As of the end of last month, the remaining amount of the puppet Central Reserve Bank notes that were directly registered with the Central Bank totaled 2.7 billion yuan, excluding the amount registered in other cities. As for how to deal with it, relevant parties stated that once the reports from other cities arrive successively and are compiled, they will then request instructions from the Ministry of Finance for handling.</p>
<h3>Factory Resumption of Work: Measures for Bidding and Sale Passed</h3>
<p>The Enemy and Puppet Industry Review Committee of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District passed the following yesterday: (1) Measures for the bidding and sale of factories that have resumed work. A. All assets such as real estate, machinery, equipment, and decoration that are not affected by the resumption of work will still be listed in a list according to previous methods, and bidders will evaluate and bid, and the highest bidder will win the bid and purchase the entire factory. B. All raw materials, finished products, materials, accessories, etc., which are assets that change due to the resumption of work, shall be based on the quantity at the time of the winner's receipt of the factory, and the winner shall purchase them according to the evaluation of the evaluation committee, and the winner shall not raise any objections. C. If the factory that has resumed work has any uncompleted orders and contracts, they shall be inherited by the winner. (2) Return the Xing Guangying small steamer of the Shanghai Qingji Steamer Bureau, the Dafeng steamer of Dafeng Company, and the welding boat of Huaxin Electric Welding Company. (3) Return the machinery of the branch of the British Lee Hachem Motor Company, the real estate of the Christian Glory Society, the real estate of Hong Xiuzhen, the warehouse and stored materials of Haijing Foreign Company, the materials of Ba Bo Ge Boiler Company, the wood of the British Marler Company, and the stored black tea of Guanghe Company.</p>
<h3>Good News Amidst the Housing Shortage: Golden Houses Will Arrive Soon</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Mobile Golden House Investment Company of this city has recently successively ordered mobile golden houses from Montgomery Ward of the United States to supply the needs of the city's citizens. At this time of severe housing shortage, these light-use houses can solve part of the housing shortage after they arrive in Shanghai. According to the company's general manager, Zhang Huanzhang, who told reporters yesterday afternoon, the first batch of golden houses will be shipped to Shanghai in forty days, which were custom ordered by the company itself, but they can still be sold after they arrive. It is currently planned to order more than one hundred houses, all of which will arrive in February. It is expected to order two thousand houses within this year.</p>
<p>This house is composed of "units". Each unit is eight feet wide, twenty feet long, and seven feet high. The roof slopes four inches every twelve inches. The roof and walls are made of specially made 24-gauge lead sheets embedded and nailed together. The roof frame is made of steel and coated with two layers of paint, baked in a radiant heat furnace, and will not rust. The doors are equipped with wooden doors and other metal parts; the windows are made of steel frames and chemical glass and other metal parts; each window is equipped with bronze or copper venetian blinds. The floor is a steel frame with steel trusses and wooden boards. All the houses are equipped with half-inch-thick, hard insulation boards to isolate sound.</p>
<p>The price of the house is US$846.90 for each end unit and US$700 for each middle unit. Each set has two end units and one middle unit, totaling US$2,393.80. The largest empty house currently available can add another middle unit. As for the payment method, 50% of the price is paid first, and the remaining amount is paid upon delivery, but the dock customs duties are borne by the ordering customer.</p>
<p>Hoping that the Banking Industry Will Invest to Allow Citizens to Pay in Installments</p>
<p>Zhang continued to say: If the ordering customer has their own land after the houses arrive in Shanghai, it would be even better. The company is currently in contact with the Municipal Government's Standing Bureau and may allocate some vacant land in the former French Concession and Hongqiao area for citizens to rent or purchase, and the price will be lower than that of general real estate developers. At the same time, in order to enable the general public to solve the housing problem, it is hoped that the banking industry can invest in purchases and allow citizens to pay in installments, which can reduce the burden on residents.</p>
<p>Zhang also said that the United States itself does not have a housing shortage, so other wooden mobile houses cannot be supplied to foreign countries. The company is still making every effort to contact the United States to request as much supply as possible.</p>
<h3>The Results of the Vote Counting in Penglai and Hongkou: Yao Mulian, Wang Zhuyi, and Others Elected; The Date for Re-election in Changning and Yulin Is Undetermined</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Civil Affairs Office recently explained the situation of the dispute over the vote counting in the fourth district (Penglai) of this city. According to reports, there were a total of ten ballot boxes in the district. When the eighth box was opened, a certain candidate suddenly expressed disagreement and requested the vote counters to stop counting and send the ballot boxes to the court for identification. At that time, other candidates were also present and believed that this was inappropriate and expressed their opposition, requesting that the vote counting continue. The Bureau Chief, in order to respect the majority's opinion, allowed the vote counting to proceed. As a result, the elected candidates were Yao Mulian, Yao Baozhen, Zhu Liangcai, Xu Zexiang, Ye Fenghu, Zhao Yangxiong, Fan Xipin, Wang Guoxian, and Li Kaidi (the elimination of the latter three names is still subject to verification, but it is unlikely to be a problem). The date for the re-election in the ninth district (Changning) and the nineteenth district (Yulin) has not yet been determined. However, the advertisements published by the Youth League in various newspapers regarding the election dispute in the nineteenth district are completely untrue, according to the Civil Affairs Office. According to reports, the situation at the time was indeed riots by thugs, which ultimately made the election impossible to proceed. As for the election in the sixteenth district (Hongkou), the Civil Affairs Office believed that there were still some disputes, so eight ballot boxes were concentrated in the municipal government for vote counting. Now that all the circumstances have been investigated clearly, the vote counting in the district was held in Room 199 of the municipal government yesterday, with officials from the Civil Affairs Office monitoring the vote counting. More than 20 district representatives and candidates were present. The elected candidates were Wang Zhuyi, Wang Weiyin, Li Baiqing, and Zhu Hongyi. The alternate candidates were Qian Naiwen, Zhang Tianbai, Jin Qijing, and Yang Yinpu. It is also learned that the alternate candidates for the second district (Laozha) are Xu Wenzhao, Lü Guangbiao, Wang Yangzhen, Liu Zhifang, and Huang Xiaowen. The alternate candidates for the fifth district (Taishan) are Zhu Su'e, Qu Zhenhua, Hu Guopan, Du Weifan, Zhu Kongjia, Dong Kechang, Li Tianzhen, Hu Huaitian, Liu Zigang, Yin Yong, Guo Lanxin, Cao Yaxia, and Fang Yida.</p>
<h3>The Authorities' Painstaking Efforts to Adjust the Prices of Public Utilities: Water, Electricity, and Other Companies are Losing Huge Amounts of Money Every Month; Current Increases Can Only Take Care of Minimum Maintenance Costs</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Canglong</p>
<p>The wave of prices seems to have calmed down. Public utilities did not let go of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The new prices for streetcars, buses, water, and electricity have been approved by the authorities and implemented successively. This is a "painstaking effort" by the authorities, because they have said that public utilities are often affected by prices, rather than prices being affected by public utilities. They also said that public utilities should aim to serve society and reduce the burden on citizens, while still enabling them to obtain the minimum maintenance costs to continue operating continuously… It is certainly not an easy task to set a price that takes all aspects into account under these contradictory premises. The reporter would like to discuss the situation of this adjustment with the readers based on the information collected from various sources.</p>
<p>Third-Class Streetcar Increases by Three Thousand Times</p>
<p>First of all, let's talk about streetcars. If we compare the pre-war fares of the British streetcars in this city with the recent adjusted prices, we can see that the increase rate of the lowest fare is particularly sharp. According to the investigation, before the war, the highest price for third class was 27 copper coins (equivalent to nine cents), and the lowest was six copper coins (equivalent to two cents). Now the highest price for third class is 120 yuan, an increase of 1,333 times. The lowest price for third class is 60 yuan, an increase of exactly 3,000 times. Let's talk about first class. Before the war, the highest price was 33 copper coins (equivalent to 11 cents), and the lowest was eight copper coins (a little less than three cents). Now the highest price for first class is 200 yuan, an increase of 1,818 times. The lowest is 90 yuan, and the increase rate has exceeded 3,000 times. This is an interesting comparison. Hearing the increase in the lowest fare may scare you, but after all, the base price in the copper coin era was too low. Even if it is increased by thousands of times now, it is still more than enough compared to the rickshaws and pedicabs that haggle all day long. Please see that the carriages are still crowded as usual. Although the passengers will instinctively complain about the price increase, they still know that it is cheap and good!</p>
<p>Different Increases in Water and Electricity Prices</p>
<p>Let's talk about water and electricity. Before the war, the water fee of the British Shanghai Water Company was 7.5 cents per 100 gallons. Now it is 54 yuan and 55 cents, an increase of 726 times. The French Water and Electricity Company uses cubic meters as the unit of calculation. Before the war, the water fee was 8.75 cents per cubic meter. Now it is 120 yuan, an increase of 1,370 times. In terms of electricity, before the war, the American Shanghai Electric Power Company charged 16.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Now it is 50 yuan (referring to small users who consume less than 10 kilowatt-hours), an increase of 299 times. The French Water and Electricity Company charged 18.2 cents per kilowatt-hour before the war. Now the price is the same as that of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, an increase of 274 times. Comparing these two aspects, although the French Water and Electricity Company's water fee has a larger multiple increase, the electricity fee seems to be the cheapest when looking at the multiple increase!</p>
<p>Gas and Telephone are Extremely Cheap</p>
<p>The telephone fee has also been adjusted now. Before the price was adjusted, an employee of the American Shanghai Telephone Company jokingly said to the reporter that if the cost of installing a telephone in the company is calculated at the current rate (the installation fee is 5,000 yuan, and the deposit is 10,000 yuan), as long as there is a telephone in the company, people from all walks of life can have one per person. As for the cost of calls, before the war, a business telephone cost 10 yuan for 100 calls per month; now (referring to before the most recent adjustment, same below) the fee is 1,500 yuan, an increase of 150 times. Before the war, a residential telephone cost 6.5 yuan for 65 calls per month; now the fee is 975 yuan, also an increase of 150 times. Compared with the multiple increase in water and electricity, it is even cheaper. As for gas, the British Shanghai Gas Company charged 28.5 cents per degree (100 cubic feet) before the war. Now the fee is 190 yuan, an increase of only 666 times. The above prices are based on the previous month's calculations.</p>
<p>Loss Figures of Public Utilities</p>
<p>Looking at the deficit accounts of other public utilities, the British Streetcar Company lost 180 million yuan in March, accumulating a loss of 960 million yuan; the French Yongdian Company lost 170 million yuan in March, accumulating a loss of 787 million yuan; the American Shanghai Telephone Company lost 150 million yuan in March… However, in order to take care of the burden on the vast majority of common people, the authorities have limited the price adjustment of each company to obtaining the current minimum maintenance costs. The so-called maintenance costs are limited to wages, fuel, and necessary business expenses. All depreciation, official interest, and dividends are temporarily not included. We understand the depression of the current situation of various public utilities, and we experience the painstaking efforts of the authorities to adjust the prices. Therefore, so far, the prices of public utilities are still a paradise in the raging tide of prices. Let us pray silently that this paradise will prosper and grow day by day, to save prices from collapsing!</p>
<h3>Mayor Qian Sends a Telegram to Congratulate the National Government's Return to the Capital</h3>
<p>Because the National Government is about to return to the capital, Mayor Qian Dajun sent a telegram of congratulations yesterday. The text of the telegram is as follows: Respectfully to the Nanjing National Government, having read the clear order announcing the return to the capital, I rejoice in the revitalization of the national territory and remember the restoration of the Divine Land. The universe is celebrating and hundreds of millions of people are rejoicing. Tracing back to the Japanese warlords' aggression, the government, for the sake of a protracted war of resistance, moved away from the capital to the western frontier, making it the center of the whole country and the model for the military and civilians. Now, fortunately, the national foundation has been re-established, the enemy and puppet regime have collapsed, and they have returned in triumph, eliminating the flaws and fulfilling the hopes of the people across the sea, and tying the hearts of international admiration. Shanghai is close to the capital and is pleased to inherit the legacy. I respectfully send this telegram to congratulate you, hoping you will be mindful of it. Mayor of Shanghai Qian Dajun.</p>

<h3>Tang Enbo and Wang Maogong's 20 Hours in Nantong Animated the Hearts of the Ancient City's People</h3>
<p>— Nantong Dispatch on the 24th, Sent by Leng Bing</p>
<p>A few days ago, news spread in Nantong that a senior military and political official would be arriving, which was a stimulant for the local people, invigorating their hearts and opening up the current situation. Everyone on the streets and in the alleys was asking, "Has that senior official arrived?" or "Has so-and-so official come yet?" Our colleagues, the reporters, became the target of their inquiries. They fully believed that news reporters had the skill to hear from all directions, and that some clues could be discovered in this way. But, to our shame, our ears were too short, and we answered them with a "don't know"!</p>
<p>Missing Northern Jiangsu, Taking Time to Swiftly Arrive</p>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Deng Ke's arrival in Tong by plane made everyone nervous again, thinking that "this time it must be a senior military and political official." But the newspaper reports said "the person who came is not he," which was another disappointment. The Huaiyin team flew to Huaiyin the next day and went to Xuzhou.</p>
<p>Finally, the rumors were confirmed, and there was more than one senior official arriving—Wang Maogong, the Chairman in charge of the entire province, and Commander Tang, who established outstanding merits during the War of Resistance and is now stationed in the Beijing-Shanghai area. They have not forgotten Northern Jiangsu, and they are always thinking of the suffering compatriots of Northern Jiangsu in deep water and fire. Therefore, despite being caught up in military and political affairs, they took time to come to this ancient city—Nantong. This is even more precious news,</p>
<p>A piece of news that is enough to invigorate people's hearts!</p>
<p>The reporters received the good news the night before last that General Tang and Chairman Wang would arrive in Tong by special ship from Cheng. Yesterday (the 23rd), we received a notice from the relevant departments to attend the welcome meeting for all sectors of society at the Gengsu Theater at 10:00 AM. For the sake of our duties, we arrived at the venue very early.</p>
<p>Holding a Forum, Comforting and Encouraging</p>
<p>General Tang Enbo and Provincial Chairman Wang Maogong landed at Ren Gang at 6:00 PM on the evening of the day before yesterday (the 22nd) on the Minquan warship from Cheng. All stores, residents, and households in the city were decorated with bright and brilliant national flags to show their welcome. The roads were heavily guarded, and the order was good. Liu Division Commander of the 105th Division, Commissioner Xu, County Magistrate Yang, Secretary-General Ji, Chairman Gu of the Journalists Association, and Chairman Qian of the Business Consolidation Committee all rushed to the port to greet them. The two military and political leaders took a special car to Taowu Road Tao Zhi Hua Hall for a brief rest, then met with local government leaders to listen to work reports. At 8:00 AM on the 23rd, a forum was held at the headquarters of the 105th Division. First, Commander Tang and Chairman Wang gave speeches of comfort and encouragement, followed by Chairman Qian of the Business Consolidation Committee and Wang Yundian, the magistrate of Rugao County, who presented their opinions. The meeting then adjourned, and they went together to the welcome meeting for all sectors of the county at the Gengsu Theater. The audience upstairs and downstairs was packed, which can be called an unprecedented scene. At 10:00 AM, the military band played loudly in the venue, and Commander Tang and Chairman Wang arrived one after another. Mr. Tang was wearing a yellow military uniform, and Chairman Wang was wearing a dark blue Zhongshan suit. Both were energetic and dignified. In the solemn welcoming procession of the crowd, they stepped onto the stage, and the two officials humbly smiled and returned the salute.</p>
<p>Complete Construction, Absolutely No More Fighting</p>
<p>After Commissioner Xu delivered the opening remarks, Commander Tang was first invited to give a speech. The commander began to speak amidst enthusiastic applause. His attitude was so calm and excited, and his words were so passionate and clear that every sentence and every word strongly struck everyone's heart. He first explained that the victory of the War of Resistance was obtained through arduous struggle, and it was an even more glorious thing to defeat the well-prepared Japanese invaders with a backward China. The current unreasonable phenomena and sufferings are inevitable phenomena after the war and are expected. We can only grit our teeth and continue to work hard to complete the construction. Therefore, in this period, we must not be pessimistic or discouraged, let alone waver. He clearly indicated our future goals. In the future, fighting is not a solution to any problems, let alone fighting again. Therefore, the solution is not "fighting" but "struggling," and we must fight for what is right. Furthermore, in the future, we should follow the instructions of the Chairman and the national policies of the country, under the principle of the nation first and the nation supreme, and move towards the road of peace and national construction. Because we have not only won the victory but also won the peace. A burst of loud applause erupted from the crowd. Finally, he further pointed out the importance of Nantong's economy, culture, and industry in Jiangsu and the whole country. To revitalize Nantong, the first thing to do is to consolidate public security, and then everything else will be possible. He sincerely, solemnly, and responsibly stated this.</p>
<p>Anyone Who Disrupts Public Security Will Be Severely Punished</p>
<p>When Commander Tang gave his speech, he was full of vigor, his voice was loud, and his intonation was moving. His gestures and actions showed his skill. When he said, "No matter who disrupts the public security of Nantong, they will be severely punished, severely punished..." he especially showed the brave and decisive demeanor of a tiger general.</p>
<p>Finally, he had great hopes for Nantong and hoped that the Party, government, military, and groups would work together to build a new Nantong and a new China. There was another thunderous applause. This is exactly what we urgently need at present.</p>
<p>Recognize the Times, Place High Hopes on Young People</p>
<p>Next, Chairman Wang began to speak: He instructed us to recognize the times, and that China today is in a great era of moving from destruction to construction and from war to peace. If anyone tries to destroy it, they are the national traitors and the public enemies of the masses. The government has not forgotten to save the compatriots of Northern Jiangsu and announced the provincial government's policy: to restore order, stabilize people's livelihood, establish autonomous institutions according to the procedures of national construction. Genuine public opinion is created by genuine organs of public opinion, which is the genuine democracy of the Three People's Principles. Finally, he placed his most earnest hopes on the next generation of young students who will bear the burden of building a new China. Because they are the new institutions, the new cells, and the grassroots of the next generation, their responsibility is heavy. They should study with peace of mind, believe in the Three People's Principles, promote the Three People's Principles, and practice the Three People's Principles, and then they can become new cadres, successors of the next generation, and masters of Jiangsu Province. Teachers of all schools must have spirit, be diligent and thrifty, endure hardships, and be confident, and not lose their ambition due to lack of materials.</p>
<p>After the Meeting, They Visited and Boarded Ships Southward</p>
<p>Then, Commissioner Xu expressed his warm regards to the commander and Chairman on behalf of all the people, and everyone stood up and bowed three times. Because of the time, Commander Tang was anxious to return to Wuxi, and the meeting was declared over in a warm and exciting atmosphere.</p>
<p>After the meeting, Commander Tang took a special car with Division Commander Liu, Deputy Division Commander Yu, and others to visit the Dasheng Yarn Factory in Tangzha, accompanied by Mr. Wu [name unclear] who took them on a tour of the workshop. The reporter followed them. At 1:30 PM, Commander Tang, in a hurry to return to defense, turned to Tianshenggang, boarded a speedboat, and sailed to the Renjiagang warship. After the meeting, Chairman Wang, accompanied by Commissioner Xu, County Magistrate Yang, and others, went to the Commissioner's Office, the County Government, the County Health Center, the County Party Headquarters, the Bus Station, and other agencies for a week-long inspection before taking a special car to Renjiagang to board the ship southward.</p>
<h3>A Pilgrimage to the Highest Institution of Learning on Treasure Island, The Cradle of Taiwan's Medical Community</h3>
<p>— Dispatch from Taiwan on the 28th, Sent by Our Correspondent Mu Yun</p>
<p>As the highest institution of higher education in Taiwan, National Taiwan University has a history of eighteen years. It is not only a precious land on the beautiful treasure island, but also occupies a lofty and superior position in the academic world of the Far East. The reporter arrived at the University Headquarters in Suido-cho on a sunny morning and made a general tour.</p>
<p>The predecessor of National Taiwan University was Taipei Imperial University. Eighteen years ago, it only had the Faculty of Science and Agriculture and the Faculty of Arts and Politics. The Faculty of Medicine was established ten years ago, and the Faculty of Engineering was added one year ago. After the takeover, except for the Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Law, which will be established in the autumn, all other faculties have been put on the right track.</p>
<p>A Deep Sense of Wilderness</p>
<p>The reporter walked through the stone road under the coconut grove and entered the university, where the ink marks were not yet dry. Rows of red Western-style buildings stood quietly in the smoky grassland. On the old red walls, there were bullet marks everywhere. The broken glass windows have now been replaced with wooden boards, but the glass shards are still deeply planted on the tops of the weeds. The Faculty of Arts, the Faculty of Science First Hall, Second Hall... were all quietly staying put. In the agricultural chemical laboratory, a small number of students were doing calm experiments in the messy pile of instruments. On the bulletin board of the Faculty of Engineering, there were notices such as "Students of the academic department from October of the 34th year to March of this year should quickly pay 60 yuan in tuition fees" and "The semester ends on April 20th, the semester exam is from the 22nd to the 28th, and the second semester begins on May 2nd." Sparse students in black uniforms were walking, dragging wooden clogs. A deep sense of wilderness came to my heart, making me realize that the diluted academic atmosphere and the university were still lingering in the wartime stage!</p>
<p>Dr. Tu's Leadership</p>
<p>The leading faculties are not the other faculties, but the Faculty of Medicine, which focuses on both research and practice. The current dean is Dr. Tu Tsung-ming, 57 years old, who is the authoritative leader of the local medical community. He not only leads the students studying at the Faculty of Medicine and the 2,000 alumni of the Faculty of Medicine's predecessor, the Medical Specialty School, who are practicing medicine, but also serves as the person in charge of the Tropical Hospital Research Institute and the First Affiliated Hospital of National Taiwan University (with 100 doctors working for hundreds of patients every day in this hospital covering 15,000 square meters) and the Second Affiliated Hospital (formerly the Japanese Red Cross Hospital). The medical community in Taiwan will not forget Dr. Tu, and in the kind demeanor and calm character of Dr. Tu, the old professor, one can see the depth of the local people's pursuit of medical and scientific development.</p>
<p>He told the reporter how they tried their best to preserve the crystallization of the Faculty of Medicine and the entire university—machinery, books, medicines, specimens... during the bombing and evacuation period. They evacuated to Daxi, a suburb of Taipei, and continued their research and study in a national school for nearly half a year, and more than 90% of the essence was preserved.</p>
<p>In the past, the proportion of local students in the entire university was very small, but there were more local people studying medicine. Today, the Japanese students have scattered with their parents, and now all are local and a few other provincial students, totaling 200 people. Dr. Tu is now busy arranging for the local young students who have been sent back from Tokyo to continue their studies. He said with great interest that the Japanese professors who were requisitioned are still retained, totaling fourteen or five people. The total number of local people serving as professors, associate professors, and lecturers is more than thirty or forty.</p>
<p>In the past, National Taiwan University established graduate schools and research departments, and more than 400 people obtained degrees. With this change in organization, it will give a Bachelor of Medicine degree after graduation, just like universities in the mainland.</p>
<p>Under the practical leadership of Dr. Tu, in addition to the more than 100 students of the Faculty of Medicine, there are three or four hundred workers who are doing in-depth research on medicine. They are the saviors of local patients and will also be the cradle of the medical community in the new China in the future.</p>
<p>Academic Exchange</p>
<p>In medicine, they are generally researching tropical diseases such as malaria, anthropology, parasites, snake venom, Chinese medicine, opium, experimental pathology, nutrition, tuberculosis, and thyroid disease. Many of them are already well-known figures in the province. In the branch of the Tropical Hospital Research Institute in Shilin Town, a suburb of Taipei, they have successfully developed sera, vaccines, and injections for typhoid fever and cholera. In particular, sera can be produced to supply injections for 5 million to 10 million people each year, which means that each of the 6 million people in the province can get two injections a year.</p>
<p>For vaccines, they have invented not only liquid vaccines but also dry vaccines, which can be planted by soaking them in water when they are used. This is a revolution in vaccines.</p>
<p>In the Tropical Hospital, the other main tasks are the Chemical Department for inspecting medicines, the Tropical Disease Department, the Tropical Hygiene Department, the Public Health Department, and the Chinese Medicine Department, which focuses on analyzing and testing the efficacy of Chinese medicine. Regarding Chinese medicine, Dr. Tu stated his opinion, saying, "Originally, the problem of Chinese medicine is the medical theory passed down since the Huangdi Neijing (Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon) and the Taisu Jing (Great Simplicity Canon), but on the one hand, it uses yin and yang, the five elements, and the five movements and six qi to explain abstract philosophical theories, which is also an idealistic theory. But if you study it further, in fact, the treatment methods of Chinese medicine, such as Zhang Zhongjing's 'Treatise on Febrile Diseases,' are actually practical and effective theories and treatment methods. So I very much agree with using Chinese medicine as a reference." Then he said, "Truth is one. If Chinese medicine can avoid going around in circles in a limited circle and go through modern scientific methods and scientific education, it can definitely achieve greater results."</p>
<p>He specifically pointed out that more than two kinds of special medicines have already achieved results. One is to extract an effective ingredient from the snake venom of the Cobra as an analgesic, which obtained a patent four years ago. The other is Kushenzi (Sophora flavescens) as a special medicine for dysentery. This research report will be publicly released at the Taiwan Medical Association on the afternoon of the 20th. Regarding Chinese medicine, they will not only not give up but will strengthen research and prepare to establish a Chinese medicine treatment department, responsible for clearing and promoting the heavy responsibility of Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>Dr. Tu solemnly explained the four missions of the Faculty of Medicine of National Taiwan University: (1) To select local doctors and specialized talents as much as possible to engage in health work in the mainland; (2) To welcome doctors and scholars from the mainland to come to the province for research; (3) To transport research products to the mainland; (4) To organize purely academic research associations with specialized scholars in the mainland.</p>
<p>This academic exchange will affect the medical community in the mainland and will further enhance the position of the Faculty of Medicine of National Taiwan University. It is firmly believed that with Dr. Tu's perseverance and spirit, success can be expected.</p>
<p>Searching for American Pilot Graves in Taiwan</p>
<p>Members of two Chinese battlefield patrol teams are searching in Taipei for the graves of American pilots who were shot down during air raids. The headquarters of the U.S. military patrol team is located in Nanjing, and ten teams are scattered throughout China, Vietnam, and neighboring islands to thoroughly investigate the cause of death and burial sites of more than 700 American soldiers who were registered as missing in action with the U.S. Department of the Army.</p>
<h3>Housing Crisis in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng Reporting from Hangzhou, 29th of this Month</p>
<p>Hangzhou rioted against rice shops due to the rice shortage. But now, Hangzhou is also facing a housing crisis. Who will they riot against this time?</p>
<p>An individual working in the provincial government told the reporter, "In Hangzhou, finding a wife is easier than finding a house." Every day, as we walk the streets or sit in tea houses and hotels, we see people looking for houses or discussing housing matters. This isn't just among those from other provinces, but also many Hangzhou locals; not only those without houses but also those who already own them.</p>
<p>Before the war, Hangzhou's population peaked at 788,000. There are no accurate statistics now, but it is said to be only over 400,000, a decrease of 300,000. Very few houses in downtown Hangzhou were destroyed; perhaps only one-twentieth were damaged. But the population has decreased by far more than one-twentieth. Even if many houses in Nanxing Bridge and the gate area were destroyed, causing the population to concentrate in the city center, old-timers in Hangzhou say that the population of Nanxing Bridge and the gate area wouldn't exceed 100,000, and that rough estimate of Hangzhou's population of over 400,000 already includes them.</p>
<p>We can say this: Hangzhou does not really have a housing shortage. Even if there aren't enough houses, it shouldn't be this severe. So where is Hangzhou's housing shortage coming from? An old Hangzhou resident said, "There are empty houses in Hangzhou, but people would rather leave them empty than rent them out!"</p>
<p>Before the war, it was easy to find houses in Hangzhou. Many stone-framed doors had "For Rent" signs posted. During the war, Hangzhou was occupied, and the enemy and puppet regime forcibly seized many houses, using some as warehouses to store goods and others as residences for enemy and puppet officials. After the war, our troops came to take over, driving out all the Japanese, Japanese soldiers, puppet soldiers, and puppet officials living in civilian houses. They were replaced by many dependents. Later, the troops left, but the dependents didn't. Some even had one or two people living in a large house. Some landlords made agreements with others, but when the tenants came to move in, they were shouted out and got nowhere. Some tenants moved their furniture into the house and tried to reason with the people living inside, but the unwelcome occupants threw the furniture into the street. They wanted to reason with them, but the other party was wearing disheveled military uniforms, and the insignias were unclear. They spoke more forcefully than the landlord and were more fierce. The house seemed to be theirs.</p>
<p>Without a solution, they asked some other respectable people to negotiate. The people living in the house then said, "I don't like this house at all. I'm going to move, but houses outside require gold bars, 'digging fees,' and rental deposits. How can we 'poor civil servants' afford to rent them? I'm looking for a house now, and I'll move as soon as I find one." They were truly confident and righteous.</p>
<p>"When will you move?"</p>
<p>"That depends on when I find a house." They still got nowhere. Some people said that the only way to get a house is to use "power." For example, if a high-ranking official wants a house, then a low-ranking official has to try his best. How does the low-ranking official try his best? He still has to ask the people for it. When the people have no choice, they have to ask the low-ranking official to ask the high-ranking official to plead on their behalf and send gifts. This is the bureaucratic way of handling housing disputes. There are simply too many such examples.</p>
<p>Another type of house is one where the owner went to the interior with the war of resistance and entrusted the house to a caretaker. Over the past seven or eight years, the caretaker has become the master. He lives in the best house, takes deposit fees, and takes "digging fees." When the owner comes back and wants to live in the house, he says that the house has already been rented out to others. There are quite a few examples like this.</p>
<p>There are also house brokers who specialize in house trading. After they find out about a house, they solicit people who want to rent it. The tenants pay a high price to "dig" and a high price for a deposit. These brokers profit from it.</p>
<p>The people of Hangzhou have a reputation for being "iron heads." They can smash rice shops out of anger, but they cannot smash the houses of those who live in them unreasonably out of anger. Although rice is a matter of food, which is of utmost importance to the masses, housing is a matter of living, which is also of concern to the masses. However, houses are one by one, building by building. People who forcibly occupy houses can only be defeated one by one.</p>
<p>"Clothing, food, housing, transportation" are the four basic needs. We want the government to solve these four basic needs for the people with rice. But does the government have a solution? More than 400,000 citizens of Hangzhou are watching with wide eyes!</p>

<h3>Peiping Union Medical College Seeks to Reopen as Soon as Possible</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 2nd] A spokesman for the China Medical Board announced today that the Peiping Union Medical College, which was occupied by the Japanese army in 1941, has now been recovered and efforts are being made to reopen it as soon as possible. However, it is unlikely that it will be fully restored to its original state this year. The Rockefeller Foundation, which founded the Peiping Union Medical College, has reportedly held several meetings to prepare for the reopening of the school. Discussions have included the difficulty in obtaining important new equipment and securing pre-arranged transportation. Post-war surveys show that most of the school buildings are intact, but much of the laboratory and other equipment is missing or severely damaged. The Japanese used the school as a hospital and for experiments. The spokesman said that according to the planned schedule, the school will be expanded as soon as more new equipment is obtained. Before the war, the school primarily admitted Chinese students, with a small number of foreign students admitted only if there were vacancies.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Lishui News] All teachers and students of Lishui Chuzhou Middle School, in the midst of soaring living expenses, saved on food and clothing, donated funds, and collected 5,438 catties of rice to help all the poor people in the Lishui urban area. The rice was distributed a few days ago in the large playground of Longmen Ridge, with ten catties given to each extremely poor person, totaling over four hundred and sixty households, all of whom were women and children in need.

<h3>Japanese Education Must Be Completely Reformed, Advocates Dr. Compton of the United States</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Pullman, Washington, April 1] Dr. Compton stated in a speech to the Washington State University conference on April 25: I believe that the only answer to the Japanese problem is to improve public education. Dr. Compton, President of Washington State University, was a member of the education mission recently sent by the Army Department to investigate the Japanese school system. Dr. Compton said: Japanese education, from elementary school to university, is concentrated in the center, so it is very easy to be a tool for politicians and warlords. The Japanese themselves call their education "feudal, military, and bureaucratic." We (the US education mission) suggested to General MacArthur and, through MacArthur, to the Japanese government, to completely reform not only the goals of Japanese education, but also the organization and structure of Japanese public education, so that Japanese schools at all levels become tools for democratic education, not tools for war.</p>

<h3>Hunan's Education Recovery</h3>
<p>— By Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent in Changsha, Gao Yuanli</p>
<p>"In the recovered areas, only Hunan's teachers and staff have not been screened, and only Hunan's students have not been classified. This is truly Hunan's glory, and it proves that Hunan's education indeed has achieved this." Mr. Wang Fengjie, the Director of Hunan's Education Department, said this to reporters. He also emphasized that in the vast occupied territories, only Hunan did not establish a puppet provincial government. The reason for this is that there were quite a few righteous people who valued moral integrity. In the final analysis, it is because decades of education have not wasted effort.</p>
<p>The development of Hunan's education must be attributed to the advocacy of the late President Tan Yan, [庵]. When Tan governed Hunan, not only could applications for registration be approved, but spiritual and material assistance was also provided. Therefore, schools also developed a kind of atmosphere. In twenty years, the number of private secondary schools alone increased to about two hundred. Most high-ranking officials participated in Changsha's education. At that time, Changsha's music never ceased, and on weekends and holidays, the city was full of students in cloth uniforms, which was once praised as a beautiful sight.</p>
<p>In the early years of the War of Resistance, Hunan's education experienced some disturbances. When Wuhan fell, Changsha's situation was precarious. For safety reasons, the school authorities almost entirely moved west, with most concentrating in Anhua Lantian and some moving to Yuanling.</p>
<p>After the Great Fire of Changsha</p>
<p>After the Great Fire of Changsha, the situation gradually stabilized. Schools were able to resume classes, with Yuanling and Lantian as the center, gradually developing. This phase lasted until June of the 33rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1944].</p>
<p>During this phase, it can be said that Hunan's education was at its peak. The provincial education authorities made considerable efforts in higher education, secondary education, vocational education, normal education, and national education, achieving the expected success.</p>
<p>In higher education, three provincial-level vocational schools of agriculture, industry, and commerce were established in the 30th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1941]. All campuses were located in Mount Heng. The agricultural school had three departments: agronomy, forestry, and agricultural economics. The industrial school had four departments: hydraulic engineering, architectural engineering, chemical engineering, and mining and metallurgy engineering. The commercial school had three departments: banking and accounting, statistics, and business administration. Although equipment was lacking during the war, classes started under extremely difficult circumstances, which was truly commendable.</p>
<p>In secondary education, the province was divided into school districts starting in the spring of the 30th year. The province was divided into ten school districts according to the administrative inspectorates, with the principle that each district would have a provincial-level secondary school, normal school, and vocational school. This plan was not only completed but also exceeded in a short period of time. By the first semester of the 33rd year, the total number of secondary school students in the province was 200,000.</p>
<p>In national education, development has been quite rapid since the 29th year. By the first semester of the 33rd year, out of the province's 1,600 townships, over 1,500 townships had established township-level central national schools, with 97 branch schools. Out of the province's 21,290 *bao*, over 20,300 *bao* had established *bao*-level national schools, with over 4,800 branch schools. Adding the 6,000+ private primary schools and 19 provincial primary schools, there were a total of over 26,300 schools, with 2,659,000 children enrolled.</p>
<p>The above three figures may reveal the progress of Hunan's educational development. In particular, the development of primary and secondary schools is even more astonishing. The reason for this is that after the outbreak of the war, the rural areas were quite prosperous, and food prices rose. Even families with modest means had the surplus to allow their children to attend school. (To be continued)</p>

Physical goods continued to be sold off. To the point that those who registered with the Bank of China for allotment, except for the jewelers, were almost zero. The market price, under conditions of oversupply, gradually went downstream from 1.73 million. After 10 o'clock, it hovered around 1.65 million. The Bank of China allotted to registrants at a price of 1.65 million. The industry was too busy taking care of themselves, and very few registered, only 82 individuals, mostly jewelers. Speculators were scrambling for funds. Physical goods were being sold off relentlessly. At noon, it had approached 1.6 million. In the afternoon, funds were slightly easier, and there was a slight rise. As a result, the closing price fell another 50,000 compared to the previous closing. Ornaments closed at 173,000, silver at 1,700, and silver dollars were stable. The unofficial interest rate was unusually tight in the morning, with the unofficial interest rate at over 22%, but turned slightly easier in the afternoon, with interest rates from 18% to 20%. Funds for cigarettes and miscellaneous lines of work were still tight. Because of the severe drop in gold prices, the overall situation has changed. Although the source of cash will inevitably be greatly affected in the future, the authorities' measures for management will definitely be even stricter. Holders are also mostly closing out positions. In addition, the Bank of China, due to the booming gold rush, has had to make it extra convenient for those applying for foreign exchange. Importers are satisfied with the amount they receive, so there is no need to search for expensive US dollars. Yesterday, US dollars became even more deserted, gradually becoming oversupplied from 2,400 yuan, falling to below 2,230 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it was stable. As a result, it fell another 130 yuan compared to the previous close. People are affected by the US's increase in gold and silver prices, and are once again favoring cash. The spread for hedging against gold has widened to around 730 yuan. Hong Kong dollars also fell 20 yuan, Hong Kong exchange rate was 440 yuan, Rupee was 50 yuan, the US exchange rate was still stable, and the settlement of accounts was quiet.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Fall Again</h3>
<p>Although public bonds have been moved to a different location, they are still facing many external troubles. Major holders are uneasy, and the overall financial situation is unusually tight. The bond market is even more vulnerable to attack. The opening price for the C bond was 6,200 yuan in the morning. After opening, it rose to over 6,400 yuan, but major holders began to sell off. At noon, it had fallen to around 5,150 yuan, and then slightly rebounded. The afternoon closing price hovered around 5,350 yuan. The underlying trend still favored sellers, falling 650 yuan compared to the previous close. Bonds A, B, and D fell 700 yuan each, and Bond E fell 800 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market saw a surge in supplies and sluggish sales of water goods. Both *jeng* and *hsien* round-grained rice uniformly fell by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Flour dealers competed to sell, but were tired and unable to deliver. They fell another 800 to 1,000 yuan. Bran also fell another 400 to 500 yuan. Soybean oilcake followed suit, falling 700 to 800 yuan. Both local and out-of-town soybeans were in short supply, falling 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Raw peanuts also fell 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Sesame seeds of medium and low quality also fell 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Corn fell another 1,000 yuan. The oil market continued to decline due to the continued arrival of large quantities from Qingdao. It gradually went downstream, falling another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. According to the rice market information, yesterday, the city received over 3,000 *shi* of seven types of rice, including polished *jeng*.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Flat and Weak; Cotton Transactions Still Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market lacked the strength to rise. In the early morning, it still felt firm, but then some dealers were forced to sell due to financial difficulties, and prices showed signs of collapse. The two *gan* yarns once rose to 1.95 million, but ultimately closed at 1.92 million. The other brands slightly decreased by 5,000 to 30,000 compared to yesterday's market. The 42-count double-ply yarn fell by as much as 80,000 to 90,000, with little trading. The trend seems to be weakening.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York US cotton telegraphic report fell 13 to 21 points, with the near-term price at US$27.40, the forward price at US$27.52, and the Mitin spot price at US$28.07. Local spot cotton transactions were still smooth. The privately-owned Shenxin No. 9 Factory uniquely handled 1,200 bales of Mitin and Pengjiapo brands. In addition, the First Factory imported 500 to 600 bales of Indian NT and Taicang cotton, and the Nantong Dasheng Factory imported Jia Li La, etc. Market prices were similar to before.</p>
<h3>Tight Credit, Position Shortages, and Many Bounced Checks; Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets Sluggish</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks yesterday experienced a large shortage of positions at the clearing houses of smaller banks. The unofficial interest rate was raised to over 25% the night before. Many of the checks issued by some clients were bounced. The securities industry was the first to bear the brunt. Yesterday, they scrambled to remedy the situation. Buying interest became even more sluggish, and the overall trend was extremely unfavorable. Besides closing out positions, holders had no other options. This is because the industry is clearly unable to fully handle it and cannot advance funds to customers, which is the reason for this. As a result, the highest opening prices in the morning were 650 yuan for Yong Yarn, 4,850 yuan for Meiya, 83 yuan for Jingfu West, 390 yuan for Xinguang, and 323 yuan for Qinyu, and they gradually fell. Near noon, it was even more [illegible], almost all closing at low prices. The afternoon closing was down about 5% for each of the five [illegible] compared to the previous close. The less popular stocks each experienced small declines. The overall market was slightly higher. Foreign stocks were also caught in the [illegible] vortex. Many were selling off. Yisha repeatedly fell from 15,600 yuan and closed near noon at a similar price. The less popular stocks showed signs of having supply without demand. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yisha fell 1,000 yuan, steel fell 10%, and the rest fell about 5%.</p>
<h3>Reduced Sales of Woolens</h3>
<p>The business of woolen merchants has been reduced lately. This is because buyers of dark-colored autumn and winter woolens are waiting for overseas imports to arrive, so neither local nor out-of-town dealers are interested. In addition, women's cheongsam materials are also falling in popularity because of the hot weather. The only items with some transactions are seasonal summer goods such as gauze, calico, white straight tributes, vanilla, white broadcloth, feather yarn, pyroxylin, fanliskag, etc. However, due to the extremely [illegible] environment, the trading power is inferior to that of previous years. Apart from [illegible], there are very few entrepreneurs in the same industry.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Continues to Fall Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the artificial silk market saw 120-count Tian [Illegible] open at 1.56 million yuan and close at 1.52 million yuan. In the afternoon, it continued to trade at the level of 1.51 million to 1.52 million yuan, falling 50,000 yuan short of the previous day's price. 150-count shiny Peacock and Earth brands traded at 1.52 million yuan. Dachang offered 2.5 million yuan for 81-minute evenness factory silk and foreign goods, but no transaction was made. Yesterday, user silk was bid up by about 50,000 yuan, but the price of Zijing did not rise or fall, and there were no transactions. Silk goods Meiya bedspreads continued to fall sharply. Yesterday morning, the market closed at 1.13 million yuan. In the afternoon, the crepe trade association market traded at 1.065 million yuan, falling 150,000 yuan on the day. The Dachen Pattern [Illegible] closed at 3,880 yuan in the morning and traded at 3,750 yuan in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was weak due to watching and waiting for actual sales and tight credit. The trend was even weaker, and it continued to decline. The public association [Illegible] sugar fell from an initial 62,750 yuan to 62,000 yuan to 61,000 yuan, and finally to 60,500 yuan to 60,000 yuan, falling 4,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Raw sugar was 58,000 yuan. The three-and-a-half early white sugar was initially 68,000 yuan and later 65,000 yuan. Only 20,000 bags of three-and-a-half early white sugar were sold by tender at 65,000 yuan and 50 bags of raw sugar at 54,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dye Orders Busy</h3>
<p>Because textile factories' desire for dyes allocated by the Deutsche Fuel Company was not [Illegible], they ordered the goods from major American trading houses. It is reported that although Hengxin Trading House accepts orders from various dyeing and weaving factories, it is unable to supply them in large quantities and distributes them on a pro rata basis. The Mayhe Trading House also offers preferential terms of promissory notes, so users are even more eager. (Wu)</p>
<h3>Zhuji Roasted Green Tea on the Market</h3>
<p>Roasted green tea has considerable consumption at home and abroad over the years after being roasted. The new goods from Lvxing Zhuji have recently appeared on the market. However, because the cost is huge, it is said that the opening price is 70,000 yuan per *dan*. As for other varieties, the demand from Suzhou and Tianjin is extremely strong. People frequently [Illegible] strengthen, and the market is moving forward. In addition to the continued rise in the price of some kinds of tea, the rest have a stable base. The special tribute green tea, which is most appreciated by European and American countries, is still being absorbed by traders due to the fact that the selling price is still palatable, so they continue to export it.</p>
<h3>US Wheat and Lumber Imports Again in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Fumi Steamship Company's Houston Vero Tel brought 2.5 million feet of lumber from Seattle. In addition, the Pillingham Victory also brought more than 8,000 tons of wheat from Seattle. It arrived at Wusong Port the day before yesterday. Because the Huangpu River lacks wharf pontoons, it is anchored outside the port.</p>
<h3>Commercial Bank Deposits in Four Major Cities in April</h3>
<p>The Central Bank's Financial Inspection Department has detailed monthly statistics on the total number of commercial bank deposits in this city and other major cities at the end of each month. And stipulates that each commercial bank must pay a deposit reserve to the Central Bank, the amount of which accounts for 20% of the total deposit. The deposits of each region in April are listed below:</p>
<p>City Name Total Deposits</p>
<p>Shanghai 55,329,857,264</p>
<p>Qingdao 1,170,775,458</p>
<p>Tianjin 13,869,231,012</p>
<p>Nanjing 2,533,017,430</p>
<h3>Few Exports, Uneven Imports</h3>
<p>Embroidery Due to domestic goods often being more expensive than foreign goods, recent export trade is extremely light. According to a person in charge of Huili Import and Export Company, the company's export goods were originally mainly lace, hairnets, [Illegible] flower handkerchiefs, etc., but currently the price of American lace is cheaper than domestic lace. Only hairnets and [Illegible] flower handkerchiefs still have a small profit to be made. It is also said that the embroidered handkerchiefs produced in Shantou are the best, but the number of exports has been very small recently, often due to inconvenient transportation and lack of production.</p>
<p>Wool The total number of British wool imported in the first four months of this year has exceeded 110,000 bales. The company's orders account for two-thirds of the total.</p>
<p>Western Medicine Regarding the import of Western medicine, it is said that most of the recent arrivals of Western medicine are vitamin ABC injections from American pharmaceutical companies such as Parker, Mauff, Western Medicine, Standard, Pujiang, International Vitamin, and Norway. However, the quantity of Crane milk powder is also quite large, but one-pound packages are extremely scarce on the market. Although the price has begun to fall back, it is difficult to [Illegible] small because the US dollar fluctuates uncertainly.</p>
<p>Cement Regarding building materials such as cement, 10,000 barrels have arrived recently, but there is no profit to be made. This is because the customs duty has increased from 10% to 30%.</p>
<p>Radio Regarding radios, currently, many import and export companies are accepting orders. However, according to a telegram sent yesterday from the United States, it will be difficult to ship various radios to Shanghai within four months. The company has wired the American manufacturers to instruct them to collect all kinds of radios from various department stores and ship them to Shanghai as soon as possible to meet urgent needs.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Issues Simplified Tax Collection Methods: Category One Business Income Tax and Excess Profits Tax During Extraordinary Periods</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Ministry of Finance has issued the simplified methods for collecting Business Income Tax and Excess Profits Tax during extraordinary periods. The Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau has also issued a notice to various industries to declare and pay taxes. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The collection of Category One Business Income Tax and Excess Profits Tax during extraordinary periods shall be handled in accordance with tax decisions and the simplified methods outlined in these measures.</p>
<p>(2) All taxpayers shall, within one month after the end of each year's settlement, declare their income to the local direct tax authorities in accordance with the law. Each business association shall, within one month of the beginning of each year, report a list of its members to the local direct tax authorities.</p>
<p>(3) The direct tax authorities shall determine the standard taxable net profit margin based on the income statements of individual taxpayers, according to the following methods:</p>
<p>(1) Based on the income statements of taxpayers in each industry, randomly inspect 5% to 20% of the businesses with complete and accurate accounting records to determine the standard gross profit margin on sales, expense ratio, and gross profit margin on capital for each industry, in order to estimate the standard net profit margin on sales and the standard net profit margin on capital for each industry.</p>
<p>(2) For industries without sufficient or incomplete accounting records for random inspection, the standard net profit margin on sales and the standard net profit margin on capital may be estimated by referring to the figures approved in the previous year, taking into account the actual business conditions and price changes of the current year. In areas recovered after the victory against Japan, where there are no approved figures from the previous year, the standard net profit margin may be determined based on the actual business conditions of each industry in the current year, with reference to industries of similar nature.</p>
<p>(3) The standard net profit margins mentioned above may be graded according to the capital and business conditions of manufacturers and distributors.</p>
<p>(4) After the direct tax authorities determine the standard net profit margins for each industry, they shall send them to the review committee for review and approval, along with the supporting documents. Upon receiving the aforementioned documents, the review committee shall convene a meeting and make a decision within ten days.</p>
<p>(5) When the review committee holds a meeting, representatives from the direct tax authorities, local chambers of commerce, and industry associations may attend to present their opinions and provide consultations.</p>
<p>(6) The direct tax authorities shall first calculate the net profit margin on sales and the net profit margin on capital for each industry based on the income statements. If the net profit margin declared by the taxpayers in each industry meets the standards stipulated in Article 3, their declared income shall be used for tax calculation in accordance with the law. If it does not meet the standards, their income shall be calculated according to the standards stipulated in Article 3 for tax calculation in accordance with the law, and no further accounting audits shall be conducted. For businesses that have already been audited, taxes shall be calculated according to the results of the audit in accordance with the law. If any concealment or false reporting is found during the audit, in addition to the penalties stipulated in Article 19 of the Income Tax Law and Article 11 of the Excess Profits Tax Law during extraordinary periods, their income and tax payable shall be determined accordingly.</p>
<p>(7) For those who fail to report within the prescribed time limit, the direct tax authorities may calculate their income based on the standard net profit margin of the respective industry and collect taxes in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>(8) In areas recovered after the victory against Japan, the local direct tax authorities may first determine the various standard net profit margins for each industry in accordance with the provisions of Article 3, and calculate the income of each business and merchant in accordance with the provisions of Articles 6 and 7. Then, add up the income of each industry to determine the total income tax amount for the city or county. Based on this income tax amount and with reference to the budget amount of tax revenue for each city or county, calculate the tax payable by each business and merchant, prepare a list, and send it to the review committee for review and approval within two months in accordance with the procedures stipulated in Articles 4 and 5, along with the supporting documents.</p>
<p>When the review committee reviews and approves the tax amount for each city and county mentioned above, it shall take into account the distribution budget of each city and county. The direct tax authorities shall make a final decision on the tax amount approved by the review committee.</p>

<p>(10) If the business premises of the head office and its branches are not in the same location and the capital has not been divided, their income shall first be calculated separately in accordance with the provisions of Article 6, Paragraph 4, and then the head office shall calculate the tax on the total income in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>(11) Temporary business operations and businesses that have ceased operations shall declare their taxes to the direct tax authorities at any time. The direct tax authorities shall investigate and determine the tax amount at any time.</p>
<p>(12) If a taxpayer is dissatisfied with the tax payment notice, they may pay the tax within the prescribed time limit and submit relevant accounting books and documents to apply for a review. Taxes shall be calculated in accordance with the results of the review. However, those who fail to report within the prescribed time limit and those whose taxes are calculated in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 may not apply for a review.</p>

<h3>The Inevitable White Man</h3>
<p>— (Continued from Last Issue) Original by Jack London, Translated by Lu Mang</p>
<p>"What Saxe Daofu was fortunate in was that the black men only shot accurately at close range. They did not put their guns to their shoulders. They waited until they were close to a person, and then they put their guns on their hips and fired. When his rifle got too hot, Saxe Daofu switched to another one. That's why he brought two rifles with him.</p>
<p>"What was astonishing was the speed of his shooting. Also, he never missed. If there was anything inevitable, that was it. What made the massacre so horrifying was the speed of his shooting. The black men had no time to think. When they were about to think, they all rushed to one side of the boat, naturally capsizing the canoe. Saxe Daofu never stopped. The water was full of black men, still bang, bang, bang, he shot his bullets into their bodies. Not a single one missed, I could clearly hear every bullet penetrate into the flesh with a thud.</p>
<p>"The black men scattered and swam towards the shore. The water was a layer of trembling heads. I stood up, as if in a dream, and watched all this - the trembling heads and the heads that stopped trembling. A few distant shots are very boastful. Only one person reached the shore, but just as he stood up to step onto the shore, Saxe Daofu hit him. It was beautiful. And when two black men rushed over to drag him out of the water, Saxe Daofu also hit them.</p>
<p>"I thought everything was over, but just then I heard the sound of a rifle again. A black man crawled out of the entrance to the main cabin, ran towards the railing, and fell halfway. The main cabin was packed full of them. I counted twenty. They came up one at a time and rushed towards the railing. But they never got there. This reminded me of skeet shooting. A black body would crawl out of the entrance to the main cabin, Saxe Daofu's rifle would bang, and the black body would fall down. Naturally, those below didn't know what was happening on deck, so they continued to crawl out until the last one was shot dead.</p>
<p>"Saxe Daofu waited a moment, seeing that there were definitely none left, before descending to the deck. He and I were the only two left of the entire crew of the Duchess, I was too badly injured to move, and he was now useless after shooting. At my direction, he washed the wound on my head and sewed it up. A large gulp of whiskey made me stand up resolutely. There was nothing else to do. Everyone else was dead. Saxe Daofu tried to raise the sail, he pulled, and I held the rope roll. He had become a stupid, ignorant sailor again. He was worth less than a penny, and when I fainted, it seemed like we were all done for.</p>
<p>"When I woke up, Saxe Daofu was sitting on the railing, at a loss, waiting, asking me what he should do. I told him to check the injured to see if there were any who could crawl. He gathered six together. One, I remember, had broken a leg; but Saxe Daofu said his arms were still good. I was lying in the shade, chasing away flies, and directing how to bandage, while Saxe Daofu was in charge of his group of treated. If he hadn't found the hoisting rope and raised those poor black men onto every rope of the lanyard platform, I would have been endlessly grateful. One of them came off the rope halfway up and fell dead on the deck; but Saxe Daofu forced the others to hold on to their positions. When the foresail and mainsail were raised, I told him to cut the rope tying the anchor and let the ship untie. I got myself to the stern helm and planned to steer her forward. I couldn't guess how he did it, not only did he not cut the rope, but he lowered the second anchor, making us doubly anchored.</p>
<p>"Finally, he managed to cut both ropes, raised the jib and headsail, and the Duchess was on her way. Our deck was truly a spectacle. Dead and dying black men were everywhere, several of them shot in the most unimaginable places. I called Saxe Daofu and his cemetery group to lift them up and throw them off the side of the ship, the dying and the dead. The sharks had a feast that day. Naturally, our four murdered Yong sailors were treated the same way. However, we put their heads in a sack, and put in some heavy things, so that they would not drift to the shore. And fall into the hands of the black men.</p>
<p>"I decided to use our five prisoners as sailors, but they decided the opposite. They waited for their chance and jumped off the boat. Saxe Daofu hit two in mid-air with his pistol, and there were three more, if I hadn't stopped him, he would have already killed them in the water. I was a little tired of the slaughter, you understand, and, also, they were helping to get the boat out. But this kindness was in vain, because the sharks swallowed all three of them.』</p>
<p>『We couldn't see land, but I had a bit of a fever in my head. Anyway, the Duchess sailed for three weeks before I got myself up, and then we made her slowly sail to Choudni. Anyway, those Malu black men learned a permanent lesson, that there is no good in fooling a white man. In this matter, Saxe Daofu was really inevitable.』</p>
<p>Charlie Roberts blew a long whistle and then said:</p>
<p>"Well, I should say so. But what about Saxe Daofu?"</p>
<p>"He joined the sealing ships and became a famous expert. For six years he had a high reputation in the shipping industry in the two cities of Victoria and San Francisco. In the seventh year, his schooner was captured by a Russian cruiser in the Bering Sea, and all the crew, according to popular legend, were imprisoned in the Siberian salt mines. At least I have never heard of him since."</p>
<p>"Cultivating the world," Roberts murmured. "Cultivating the world. Well, this is for them. Someone has to do it this way, cultivating the world, I mean."</p>
<p>Captain Woodward touches the crisscrossing scars on his bald head.</p>
<p>"I have done my part," he said. "Forty years to now. This will be my last voyage. Then I'm going to go home and settle down."</p>
<p>"I'll bet you this wine you won't," Roberts challenges. "You'll die in labor, not at home."</p>
<p>Captain Woodward accepted the bet immediately, but, personally, I think Charlie Roberts will win it.</p>
<h3>Save the Elderly</h3>
<p>— Zhong Yuan</p>
<p>Someone knocked lightly on our door, (opening it) to see that it was the old gatekeeper from a certain organization next door. He saw my father and said with a worried face, "Sir, please help me, my job is gone!" Father asked him how he lost it, and he said, "They嫌 me for being old and not doing things nimbly, so they don't want me anymore!"</p>
<p>My friend Zhang Jun occasionally came to chat, talking about the recent situation of the hospital he served in, saying that recently the hospital laid off a group of employees over the age of sixty, because these older people are not only physically weakened, but their minds and thoughts are also mostly outdated and unsuitable for work.</p>
<p>A teacher who had been unemployed for a long time entrusted me to ask a certain principal to intercede, hoping to arrange a position for him. At first, the principal agreed readily, but when he asked the teacher's age, he immediately shook his head and said, "Too old, not popular!"</p>
<p>"Old pearls are worthless," what pitiful old people!</p>
<p>We often hear the calls to "save the children" and "save the next generation." That's right, children are the masters of the country's future, and the next generation is the lifeline of society. They should be valued and protected with all our strength. However, the "previous generation" who once were the masters of the country and the lifeline of society are now abandoned by everyone because they are old and useless.</p>
<p>Rather than saying it's a social problem, it's more of a conscience problem, isn't it?</p>
<p>Save the elderly!</p>
<h3>A Loving Couple (32)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Among the children, only Li Yun still retains her true and simple nature. Although she is more lonely than her companions, in her impression, her father never gave her any education, and her mother never gave her any love! She is like a small grass growing in the natural wilderness, she has never enjoyed any artificial grace. So when her parents left her and she was taken in by Mrs. Mo, she regarded Mrs. Mo as her biological mother, and she was very calm and accustomed to this new environment. Especially with Yu Hua as a companion, she felt great happiness. She did not miss her parents at all, and her feelings for her parents were very weak. She seemed to have no feelings; if she did, they were extremely floating and scattered; therefore, she had much less trouble!</p>
<p>Mrs. Mo's ability to manage the family is quite large. In the past six months, she has lived very comfortably. Mr. Mo's funeral was naturally handled hastily, so not only did it not cost Mrs. Mo any money, but Mr. Mo's death also saved Mrs. Mo a sum of regular food and drink expenses.</p>
<p>In the first six months, Mrs. Mo was busy with housework and didn't feel lonely. After six months, Mrs. Mo's housework gradually came to an end, and she gradually felt bored. Although she often went to play mahjong with her neighbors to pass the time, this could not occupy all of her time after all. When she was free, she would become impatient and restless. The Jingzhou Renewal Grand Stage came to another troupe of Beijing opera, but Mrs. Weng Er was not here, and she was too lazy to go and see it alone. For this reason, she had been missing Mrs. Weng Er especially recently. After Mrs. Weng Er arrived in Beijing, she had sent her a letter of greetings. She also sent Mrs. Weng Er a letter in return, reporting two funerals in the letter: one was Mr. Weng's suicide, and the other was Mr. Mo's death from illness. This letter was written by Bao Ling. Mrs. Mo said a sentence, and Bao Ling wrote it down. Mrs. Mo told Bao Ling to tell Mrs. Weng Er that "their old sisters are really in the same boat. They left Beijing at the beginning in the same situation; later, they lived in Jingzhou in the same situation; now their husbands have died, and they have become the same again." Speaking of this, Mrs. Mo saw that Bao Ling was a little unhappy, so she had to stop. At the same time, she was thinking in her heart: "Mrs. Weng Er has a new husband again, she should be happier than before. But I have neither an old husband nor a new husband, and I am not as good as before." A burst of sadness, and she couldn't help sighing. Bao Ling wrote the letter, but in fact he had discounted Mrs. Mo's words and did not write them completely according to Mrs. Mo's meaning. But when Mrs. Mo asked him to read it, Bao Ling still recited it to her word for word as Mrs. Mo had originally said. Mrs. Mo was satisfied and paid the postage.</p>

<h3>Chao Yang Drought and Famine - Please Fellow Villagers Quickly Seek Relief</h3>
<p>— Xiao Kangshi</p>
<p>Yesterday, I met my friend Mr. Lin Wenyi, who talked about his hometown (Chao Yang) Since the beginning of spring, it has not rained, and early rice cannot be planted. There is a panic over the rice and grain supply, and the southern region, with transportation not yet recovered, rice sources have dried up. As a result, the price of rice half a month ago required about eight thousand yuan per bushel, and the prices of other goods also soared. In total, Chao Yang County has eight hundred villages, people are starving to death, and there are even cases of selling their children for rice and abandoning daughters in the suburbs. The tragedy is indescribable! Thinking that Shanghai still has a source of relief goods from the Allied countries, the price of rice and other things continues to jump wildly. In addition, Chao Yang is located in a remote rural area, with no relief goods to aid them. The days ahead are long, and the danger is even greater. There are many wealthy Chaozhou people in Shanghai who should think of their homeland and provide monetary and material relief, so as not to expand the disaster. Then, those who have survived the robbery will no longer be devoured by drought. It is also a duty that mankind should fulfill, not to mention the friendship with our hometown? Mr. Lin's words were full of grief, and as a person of humble status with limited influence, he tearfully asked the writer to publish an article in the Shen Bao, to cry out for help, daring to beg for relief for the entire county of Chao Yang. I hope that fellow villagers in Shanghai will quickly rise up to provide relief to their hometown, then I will be endlessly thankful.</p>

<p>All the elderly residents of the Shanghai Bao'an Nursing Home sent a letter yesterday asking for justice and assistance, expressing their sincere feelings. Now, a copy of the letter to people from all walks of life: "Dear sirs: We are a group of old and pitiful people. We are currently living in the Shanghai Bao'an Nursing Home to eke out our remaining years. We heard the news last year after the victory of the War of Resistance, and we were especially pleased, fully expecting that our future lives would be stable. Unexpectedly, on March 13, Director Wu Fansun of this home, holding an official document from the Shanghai Charity Group, said: 'We have received orders from the Shanghai Charity Group to increase profits and have leased all the buildings of this home to the Apecy Candy Factory, and the old residents of this home must be moved to Nanshi this month to merge with the Relief Home.' After all the old residents gathered to discuss, they decided that they did not want to move elsewhere, because the buildings here were originally the former Qiliu Public Office, and later were taken over by the Charity Group, which was renamed the Shanghai Charity Hospital, and later the Shanghai Bao'an Nursing Home Second Branch. Because there was another Bao'an Nursing Home on Nanshi Station Road, after the War of Resistance, the South Branch moved to the Second Branch, and then merged into one in the 27th year and has continued to this day. Now the Charity Group is using the excuse of increasing profits to arbitrarily sell the buildings to others, and the original name of the Bao'an Nursing Home is being cancelled. The lives of all the old residents will be unknown in the future. Therefore, we have risen up in opposition, for the sake of maintaining all the buildings, for the sake of maintaining the lives of the old residents, and we especially appeal to people from all walks of life to provide righteous assistance. Respectfully, all the old residents of the Shanghai Bao'an Nursing Home."</p>
<p>Donations Delivered for Triplets</p>
<p>Since this newspaper published the story of a poor woman giving birth to triplets, people from all walks of life have been concerned and have donated a total of 140,900 yuan. This column sent someone to transfer the funds yesterday. The receipt is recorded below: "Now received from the Shen Bao Social Service Office a donation of 140,900 yuan in legal tender for the triplets. Please thank the enthusiastic gentlemen on our behalf. Li Weilun. Cheng Fengnv, April 29"</p>
