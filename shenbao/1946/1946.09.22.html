<h3>作勝利後首次巡視　主席昨晚飛蒞南昌　市民空巷出迎歡聲雷動</h3>
<p>〔本報南昌廿一日電〕蔣主席廿一日下午五時卅六分乘美齡號專機飛抵南昌，作勝利後首决巡視，主席戴呢帽，着草綠中山服，精神健旺，狀至愉快，下機後，歡迎大會主席團贛主席王陵基，省黨部主委陳肇英，靑年團幹事長詹純鑑，省參議會議長王枕心，耆紳歐陽武，彭程萬，龔師曾等，即相偕至主席前致敬，並由盛琦，劉芳南，王家瑩，陶聲慈四小姐趨前獻花，主席含笑接受時，曾連聲道好，與歡迎諸人一一握手後，旋含笑緩步出機塲，接受屏立道傍之南昌政軍黨團各界目長敬禮。主席行經歡迎人員之前，頻頻頷首答禮，直至站外，方於悠揚軍樂聲中偕王陵基同乘特一號轎車駛往民德路省政府後院行轅休息。歡迎人員中之各界首長曁贛，京，滬，漢各報記者，均乘車隨後，百餘汽車首尾銜接，極爲壯觀。</p>
<p>南昌二十萬市民，今以非常喜悅之心情，空巷出迎此曾將一千四百餘萬贛省同胞出諸水火，登諸袵席，睽違十二年，期待七十日之蔣主席。民衆歡迎行列由老虎口起至民德路上，長達十華里，軍政界歡迎人員，計有第六軍官總隊三千人，省幹訓團二千餘人，省府各廳處一千餘人，其餘均爲各學校學生及民衆，當主席所乘之轎車行經此綿長十華里之歡迎行列中時，民衆歡呼元首萬歲之聲，震耳欲龔，其情况之熱烈，秩序之嚴整，爲近十年來記者旅行各省所罕見。主席在車中見贛省同胞對渠愛戴之情，廿年如一日（聞主席於民國十五年任北伐軍總司令，在贛擊敗軍閥後，曾赤足着草鞋進入南昌，受卅萬市民盛大之歡迎），至爲欣慰。但主席於車窗中察及市郊民房廢墟上之破瓦頽垣時，想像南昌同胞所受敵寇侵凌之痛苦，不禁憮然久之，旋迴顧王陵基主席曰：「南昌老百姓太痛苦，應該趕快給以居屋，予以便利，共圖復興」。</p>
<p>今晨盛大歡迎會　主席决親臨致訓</p>
<p>廿一日爲主席蒞臨南禺之第一日，晨起凉風習習，市民因預知主席將臨，多着整潔之衣履，靜立街頭，欣然以待，當美齡號專機降落近靑雲譜的五里許之新機場時，適小雨乍晴，維時西山雨霄，南浦雲高，彩虹掛地，晚霞掩映，景色至爲優美，市民見機場一角彩虹倐起，均鼓掌歡呼，目爲祥瑞。</p>
<p>蔣主席蒞臨省府行轅後，贛省會各界首長以元首沿途辛勞，均候諭晉見，下午六時許，主席約王陵基同進晚餐，憲光劇社預定公演平劇，改廿二日晚舉行，各界盛大之歡迎元首大會，定廿二日上午七時在體育場舉行，蔣主席決親臨致詞，以慰勉江西同胞。</p>
<p>蔣主席廿二日出席南昌各界歡迎大會後，將赴靑雲譜吊烈士墓，並赴第六軍官總隊，對七千餘編餘軍官致詞，並擬親赴東湖濱之南昌行營舊址與被燬之圖書館巡視。</p>
<p>聯總駐贛人員鄧肯等廿五人，廿一日亦至機塲歡迎主席，渠等排立於歡迎行列之首。內中包括英，美，印，加等六國籍，渠等謂，在南昌得睹我元首丰采。至感榮幸。</p>
<p>將如集軍政各界　商贛省善後大計</p>
<p>國府沈秘書昌煥及主席侍從人員等廿四人，廿一日午十二時乘　47型294號機抵南昌，國府施參軍覺民，乘主席之納喜式「一七四二三」號汽車，於廿一日午抵省。美齡號專機飛臨南昌前，南昌機塲曾派小型教練機一架，尾繫丈餘紅白藍三色彩布，凌空飛行，預作信號，街頭歡迎民衆見後，均鼓掌歡呼。主席乘坐之美齡號專機降落約十分鐘後，國府軍務局長俞濟時所乘之「二八五」號專機，亦繼之降落。</p>
<p>〔本報南昌廿一日電〕聞蔣主席返京前，將召集贛黨政軍各界首長及地方耆紳，商討贛省善後大計，蔣主席對復興贛省災區農村之一般困難，甚表關懷，主席約一二日後返京。</p>
<h3>主席駐廬六十九日　行前訪民間疾苦　父老列隊歡送依依惜別</h3>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺廿一日電〕蔣主席廿一日晨九時卅五分由牯嶺行轅出發巡視南昌，廬山父老數十人衣長袍馬褂，在行轅門前列隊歡送。主席當下輿與之一一點首示謝，並謂；「勞步實不敢當，明年夏季再見」。旋乘輿取道含鄱口。觀音橋·秀峯寺至海會寺午餐，再由海會寺循九江星子公路折轉九江，主席沿途曾訪問民間疾苦，並視察觀音橋。秀峯寺兩處之故居。牯嶺街市廿一日曾打掃整潔，家家縣旗，戶戶張燈，以示歡送。主席自七月十四日來山駐節，迄九月廿一日適六十九日，山民因時親儀觀，倍感親切，一旦分別，無不依依。</p>
<p>〔中央社南昌廿一日電〕主席離牯前，曾巡視秀峯寺，憑弔抗戰時期敵人侵犯九江時激戰之地，旋赴海會寺午餐，按海會寺在戰前爲廬山訓練團所在地，自民國廿二年迄廿六年，每屆夏季，主席均在該地召集全國各地軍官來此受訓，灌輸民族思想，提高其軍事技能，奠立後來抗戰之基礎，主席於離牯以前，特前往巡視。</p>
<p>〔中央社九江廿一日電〕蔣主席由廬山南路下山，循環繞山麓之九星公路，於四時十五分安抵此間海軍碼頭，駐軍將領張瑞貴，梁勃及民衆代表在碼頭列隊恭送，主席未作休息，即乘海軍專艇渡江，五時正專機逕飛南昌巡視。</p>
<h3>糧食公賣　延期實施</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕京滬區糧食公賣，原定下月起開始，現因籌備不及，同時且有各種困難，決延期實施。</p>
<h3>軍調部美方人員　對調處興趣不减</h3>
<p>蔡文治對記者談話</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕今有記者問軍調部政府參謀長蔡文治，和平前途如何？蔡氏稱，觀美方眷屬新到六十六單位二百七十餘人，可知美方調處之興趣。據記者所悉，彼等來平前，均同意美政府所提須有至少居住一年之決心。共產黨在軍調部所表現者爲消極，工作人員日减，昨又有重要人員十六人送回張家口，外地小組有减無增，作戰地區之小組，不但不能調處，且須急謀調回，否則一樣有性命危險，且被對方視作間諜。軍調部內，對於違反和字第幾號命令等問題，亦僅談談面已</p>
<p>〔本報長春廿日電〕軍調部長春前進分部政府調處處長吳行中少將隨員兩人，今晨飛哈爾濱，並擬轉齊齊哈爾，預計作一週間之訪問。</p>
<h3>南通小組將返平</h3>
<p>〔本報南通廿一日電〕北平軍　部南通小組美代表屈門漢上校等一行五人，日前自共軍區脫險返通，所携物件，均遭共軍刧留，狀殊狼狽，現仍寓桃之華旅館，連日正整理一切，將偕同白蘭克赫司脫中校赴北平，有所報吿</p>
<h3>赤峯執行小組　業已失去自由</h3>
<p>〔中央社朝陽廿一日電〕赤峯第二執行小組，睹承德小組之遭遇後，本身已感不安，傳曾計劃撤退至北平，但因赤峯機塲慘遭破壞，擬改乘吉普車赴朝陽，轉赴北平，現該小組正向國共雙方接洽通過中，李運昌抵赤峯後，該組美代表遂失去自由，安全堪虞，該組美方代表爲麥開撒上校等三人，政府代表爲劉無畏上校，譯員陳正屛，電台台長羅沃開</p>
<h3>外匯將經常調整　辦法已擬定現正呈核中　外傳將再放長說未證實</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕此間有關方面對滬市塲所傳外匯將再調整之說，未能予以證實。某權威人士稱，政府公布新匯率迄今前後相距僅一個月，再度放長，似不可能，此種傳說之起，或由於國際銀行方面需要我重新確定法幣價値，與美金，法郞有再度貶値說所引起。另聞，有關方面已擬定一調整外匯辦法，擬經常的作比數不大之調整，現正送呈當局核示中。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕據悉，中央造幣廠工作現已停止，滬報載該廠爲適應將來幣制改革，而擬具復廠計劃，並請財部撥經費數十億一事，並不可靠，該廠滬廠爲敵偽破壞甚鉅，呈請撥予經費，加以修復則有之。舊幣制改革統一事，固爲將來所必行者，但目前談之尙早，即政局平定後，亦須相當時期，始可談改革。</p>
<h3>豐鎭大同國軍會師　張垣共軍眷屬紛紛逃逸　集寗國軍正向商都推進</h3>
<p>〔本報歸綏廿一日電〕十二戰區馬占山部，昨日由大同出擊，當晚進至孤山，今日下午與豐鎮出擊之部隊在堡子灣會師。按此解救大同之指揮官，即去年最先接收大同之孫蘭峯將軍。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕官方確息，綏東國軍與大同守軍，廿日午會師於豐鎭六驛間，自此歸綏與大同之大道，已完全打通。刻歸綏集寗業已通車，集寗至大同間，刻正加緊修復工作，短期內即可通軍。集寗戰役，共軍傷亡慘重，姚喆之副司令張柏亦陣亡，現賀龍部已自晉西北左雲右玉撤退，聶榮臻蕭克則向張家口方面撤退，原駐集寗之第一小組，雖已安全返平，但傳長官之代表周北峯（綏地政局長）迄今下落不明，上月傳曾派周氏前往集寗豐鎭，勸賀龍解圍大同，毫無結果，集密戰事乃發作。張家口之冀察晉日報，喻周爲來栖，周之安全，頗成問題。</p>
<p>〔本報天津廿一日電〕大同共軍於城郊大肆縱火後，即向張垣潰退，張垣則已有共軍眷屬三數千人，扶老携幼，紛經五台向岢嵐逃去。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕靑龍　方面，今日仍平靜，惟北平北至昌平間之公路橋樑二座，被共軍破壞，國軍已出動修理。據官方情報，康莊現駐有共軍一二零師部，懷來駐有共軍兩個旅三個團。延慶駐有共軍一個團，刻雙方尙在調動時期，一二日內或尙不致有戰事爆發。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕國軍向張家口推進消息，仍不能得到有力者之具體證明，詢諸關係方面，均諱莫如深，並以陳總長來平時，曾嚴令不許隨便透露軍事情况爲答，但謂待有結果，則不妨發表。傳朱德確在張垣坐鎭。軍調部政府方面表示，張家口小組之政府與美方代表，均受共軍監視，美方電台亦禁使用，該小組能否接回，尙成問題。另一熟悉察綏軍事地理者稱，綏東國軍進攻張家口，有三路綫可循，一爲由豐鎭經鎭用口陽高柴溝堡，一爲由豐鎭經隆盛莊柴溝堡，一爲由集寗經商都尙義張北，此三路綫以第一錢爲便利。據悉收復集寗之國軍，已分兵一路，向商都推進，進展情况不明。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿一日電〕政府軍已於今日發動對張家口之攻勢，先進攻北平西北二百里之南口，惟此訊尙未能證實。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿一日電〕自接近政府之高級官方人士證明，張家口及哈爾濱已成爲國軍進攻之主要目標後，此間有資格方面相信中國國內局勢及美國調人地位，在最近將來將有急劇之發展，對於美蘇兩國對華政策，或將引起嚴重之反響。（蘇魯戰訊請閱第二版）</p>
<h3>蔣夫人由牯抵滬　馬使夫人及宋子良同來</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕將夫人偕馬歇爾特使夫人，昨日下午一時乘機離牯飛京，抵京後稍事休息，即於五時許原機飛滬，其時秋雨驟緊，航程不便，夫人等乘機抵滬後，因視綫欠明，尋覓機塲不易，乃於本市上空盤旋數週，六時四十分在龍華機塲安全降落，到塲歡迎者有吳市長夫婦及甫自北平來滬之黃仁霖，警局代表嚴鵠組長，美軍代表査爾斯上校等。隨兩夫人同機來滬者，有中國建設公司總經理宋子良，蔣夫人副官張永良等。</p>
<p>〔中央社主市訊〕蔣夫人與馬夫人，在中國避暑勝地之廬山度過炎炎長夏後，於昨晚乘馬歇爾特使專機四七六六五〇號飛抵滬，往機塲鞦迎者將二夫人攙扶下機，並頻稱：「夫人小心」。聞渠等此來將作五六日小憇，並無特別任務。二夫人登汽車後，微笑點頭，向來迎者致意，即驅車赴東平路蔣公館休息。</p>

<h3>冀中國軍推進　昨收復白溝鎭</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕保定電話：（一）向雄縣推進之國軍，已擊潰共軍主力，昨晚收復重要據點白溝鎭，即在該鎭設縣政府，以控制全縣，現國軍已越白溝河前進二十華里。（二）向保定西南推進之國軍，昨晚收復東西林水等四據點，共軍新調二野戰團來援，正激戰中。（三）平渶路沿綫共軍，有大事破壞鐵路準備，昨晚有于家莊徐水兩車站被共軍襲擊，激戰三小時退去，同時定興新城昨晚亦被襲擊，又共軍萬餘昨開抵高牌店車站附近，有攻該車站企圖。</p>
<h3>東北百萬日軍　竟吿神秘失踪</h3>
<p>美議員要求蘇聯說明</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿一日電〕美衆議院軍委會委員希立登與席克斯兩議員，頃要求强迫蘇聯對神秘失踪不見之在東北一百萬日軍，加以說明。</p>
<h3>馬司兩使昨晤談　政局正在發展中</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕軍事節節進展聲中，和平談判仍不絕如縷，尤以馬·司兩使仍以積極信心作種種最後之努力。廿一日馬特使於上午十一時訪司徒大使，談半小時辭去，是時國府參軍皮宗敢亦往訪，馬使辭去後，皮再與司使及傅涇波晤談，未幾離去。下午一時共產黨王炳南再應的訪司使，僅留半小時。據司使左右人士稱：局勢正在發展中，記者曾詢以是否好的發展，據答，談話內容現尙不能公布，但發展當屬有希望的方面。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕頃悉，共產黨目前對三人·五人會議之爭，已轉淡，惟其目標則不變，即必須立即停戰。至外傳五入小組商談內容可予擴大一事，共產黨則仍表示堅決拒絕，因共產黨欲先談停戰，政府則主以改組國府委員會之主題談妥後，再談其他，故共產黨當不參加，惟基於停戰之前提必需召開軍事三人小組會議之觀點，今日王炳南訪司徒大使所談內容，即在上列一點上兜圈子。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕記者自某權威方面獲悉，馬特使廿日曾有一種意見文件轉交王炳南以達共產黨，內容尙無所悉，據某氏稱，此兩日內將爲大局之轉捩點，當視共產黨之答覆而定。記者旋再自美大使館及共產黨辦事處欲獲得證實，則均予以否定，認爲並無此事。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿一日電〕中央社記者因傅作義將軍致電毛澤東氏，要求其放棄武力，參加政府，赴宣傳部訪彭部長學沛，探詢意見。彭部長答稱：傳宜生先生電文，語語赤誠，不勝同感。日來國軍到處進展順利，政府對於忠勇將士，固不勝嘉慰，但同時對多數人民被中共驅迫，喪失生命，更爲惆然心傷。巾共現站在歷史的交叉路口，應深思熟慮，決定今後之政治路綫，究將繼續犧牲無數人民生侖，嘗試以武力奪取政權，抑遵從蔣主席迭次之忠告，放棄武力依循民主憲政途徑，以從事於政治之鬥爭？如從前者，於人民則延長流血，製造混亂與貧窮，於共產黨自己則朝夕受良心之苛責；如從後者，共產黨將爲中國第二大黨，爲國民黨之勁敵或諍友，或以政治方式爭取民衆之支持，或參加政府貢獻於國家之復興，利害得失，甚爲明顯，如以軍事勝敗而顧慮面子問題，殊屬無謂。抗戰中數百萬人，曾貢獻其生命於國家，今共產黨對國家貢戲若干交通要點，何所顧惜。至於周恩來先生所謂共產黨決不向國民黨屈服，更屬意外，國民黨人決不致稍存勝利或屈服之謬誤觀念，與此相反，蔣主席始終誠懇要求共產黨參加政府，參加國民大會，一個政黨如果放棄暴動政策，以從事憲政常軌之鬥爭，實爲高尙愛國之行爲，決非屈服。余觀傅將軍之電文，實與蔣主席八一四文吿之意旨完全相符。</p>
<h3>傳作義致毛澤東電</h3>
<p>（續昨）內亂是人民一致厭惡的，倡亂的你們，又如何在人民之中立足？正確的道路只有一條，在憲政常軌中，共產黨是有前途的，但武力倡亂，分裁割據，則必毀滅。請你細想：當去年勝利之初，你們提出民主，同情你們的人有多少？經過一年來事實的證明，所謂民主和平，只是你們的宣傳，而戰亂割據倒是你們眞實的行動。今天國內國外同情你們的人，又有幾個，對於你們的政策，這不是一個很顯然的測騐。做一個自命爲革命的領導者，應該曉得所謂革命形勢是客觀實在的，並不是主觀强求的，否則</p>
<p>削足適履</p>
<p>以人民之所惡，强加之於人民，是永遠不會成功的。所以我熱一誠希望你們能接受血的敎訓，立刻改變政策，放棄武力萬能的觀念，速參加政府，結束內亂，讓全國人民開足馬力來建設我們的國家。我個人始終未曾以共產黨爲敵，更沒有準備和共軍作戰，我母寗是一個同情共產黨的人，你們曾經堅決主張抗日，你們有堅決奮鬥的精神，我都欽佩，只有今天的戰亂政策，就是萬分錯誤，爲國家，爲人民設想，我請求先生立刻放棄這個政策，促憲政實現，軍隊國家化，政治民主化，來和衷共濟，一致努力，只要毛先生參加政府，以政府一員的資格，向國府保薦賀能或你們任何一位先生接替我現任的職位，我不但首先表示歡迎，並願盡力促成，你如果不嫌的話，我自己願在毛先生部下當一個最低級的職員，而絕對忠實的服從你。這樣一個和平統一民主的中國。是全國國民要求的是美蘇兩國共同希望的，也是世界各國一致同情的，我們旣與美國保持親密的合作，更與蘇聯永保親密的邦交，美蘇關係，世界和平，均可因而獲得堅固的保障。先生一轉念間，不僅中國可立致和平，人類亦將同蒙其惠，是成是敗，爲禍爲福，現在正是你們選擇的最佳機會。傅作義·酉·皓·叩。（完）</p>

<h3>社論　審核市預算的最後階段</h3>
<p>上海市參議會昨天下午討論本年下半年度預算案，論辨異常熱烈，大會可說已入最緊張最重要的階段。預算案雖因若干項收入支出的數字，尙待其他各組的審査報吿，參照討論，故未能核定歲出入的總數，但就昨天所提出的預算審査報吿書來看，可說今後大致當沒有多大更動。我們願先就昨天本報記者在塲見聞所及的報吿，及已經通過的幾款決議，略述我們的感想。</p>
<p>首先，我們認爲市參議會審核乃至討論預算案的精神，是値得市民擁護的。審査報吿所稱的審査原則是：「對於歲人預算，認爲估計較低者，酌量增加，徵收不當者予以剔除；對於歲出預算，認爲屬於行政經費者酌量裁减，屬於事業經費者照數列計。」我們以爲絕對準確。尤其我們對於昨天大會所通過的決議，責成市府主管局努力督征，整頓稅收，剔除中飽，杜絕舞弊，使稅率不增而稅收可加，務外認爲市府責無旁貸。我們知道現在有許多捐稅，市民所繳納者何止此數，而半人私囊，假定能涓滴歸公，必能超出原預算所列數字。故市府應儘先在不增新稅之條件下，盡力整飭舊稅，增加歲收，萬不可存心佔低收人，形成不數局面。如果眞正用之得常，收入不足，然後方可負責另闢稅源。至於支出，則當用者用，當省者省，「一文不落虛空地」，應是管理公家度支者所應守的軌範。尤其是，市參議會對建設事業費旣表示全部接受，則市政府更應盡力裁員簡政，儘量减少其行政費之支出，减輕市民負担，總是市府所應刻不忘懷的。</p>
<p>其次，市參議會討論時，循名覈實的作風”亦非常可取。他們認爲歲收捐稅之名目不當或時令已過者，如房捐之　征保衛團服裝費及防疫費等，毅然剔除，其不敷之數，寗願採用他法彌補足額。他們以爲向市民征收捐稅，必須名正言順，使市民大家一目瞭然，知道納稅作什麼用。現在保衛團旣早撤消，夏季防疫也已過去，若再永久在房捐項下附征，市民觀感何如？我們當然知道，經此剔除，市府要少收十七八億元，市民還是要負担彌補的責任，但我們同意市參議會的看法，寗可另闢稅源，使我們明白這項新增的稅是作什麼用的。</p>
<p>最後，我們更絕對贊成市參議會對市政府不苛求不放鬆的態度。參議會對市府原列支出，準備核减一百〇七億元之多，除了尙擬新增之支出，及剔除之收入，的須不敷當在二百三十億元之譜，道較布府原案不敷三百三十三億元，已减少了一百億。而參議會的決議，則授權市府査照此核减數額，在不减事業經費之原則下，自行通盤籌劃，斟酌事務繁簡，冗員多少，盡力裁减，以期適合，而不作硬性拘束之規定，我們認爲很得大體。這就是不苛求的作風。但同時，參議會責成市府必須於最短期間，照此決議案的範圍，重編預算送會備核，以爲將來審核決算的準繩，尤其限於本年十一月底以前造送下年度（三十六年度）的預算一點，則又表現它對市政府的收支監督，絕不放鬆。英國人常自誇他們的代議制度是先掌握了政府的「荷包權，」此次市參議會在上海市實行民主政治的初步階段中，如能秉此方針，繼續孟晋，可以說得是探　得珠，離題不遠了。</p>
<p>但是，上海市政府本年下半年度的預算，在此時討論，已經落後，只是一個試騐示範罷了。預算總額究竟若干，以及如何彌補，採用什麽新稅，我們還要竚看明天市參議會的決議。盼望參議員們要精密審愼，善盡他們的職責。</p>
<h3>華萊士矢職以後</h3>
<p>美國商務部長華萊士已於前天辭職。這不是一種意外的新聞。華萊士在紐約發表演說之後，又把他於八月廿三日上杜魯門總統書在美國各報發表，不僅使身在巴黎的國務卿貝爾納斯深感侷促不安，而且海軍部長福萊斯特和陸軍部長柏德遜也覺得不滿，不得不聯名致函杜魯門總統，聲明美國陸海兩部絕無人計擬對蘇聯採取先發制人的手段。美國政府內部意見的參差，旣暴露無遺，勢將影響到美國在國際上的地位，尤其是巴黎和會要受到一大打擊，當使社魯門總統不得不有所抉擇。華萊士的辭職，顯然是杜總統抉擇的結果。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統解釋要求華氏辭職的原因，說：「政府擁護國務卿貝爾納斯所採取之外交政策，國人固然可以絕對自由發表對於政府政策不贊同的意見，但在政府本身，必須保持一致。而今華萊士部長與政府發生「根本衝突」，至爲明顯，唯一的解決辦法，厥爲由華氏辭職。同時余亦相信，寗願以公民資格自由發表其意見。」外界盛傳，華氏辭職，係由於國務卿貝爾納斯向總統要求表明態度所致，並說華氏被迫辭職；此說雖經白宮否認，但無論如何，杜總統此番決定，實覺已無他途可循，而不得不出此者。</p>
<p>華萊士的辭職，無疑的對於美國的內政外交，必將發生遠大影響。貝爾納斯國務卿的外交政策，雖已獲得杜總統的支撑，致反對者華萊士終於去職，但不能即視爲貝爾納斯決定的勝利。因爲華萊士是故總統羅斯福新政時代碩果僅存的部長，一向視爲羅斯福新政的繼承者，他所發表的言論主張，在美國國內當有一部份人士表示擁護，尤其是美國工業組織大會。據該會政治行動委員會發表聲明稱，華萊士部長被迫辭職，對於美國國內自由與和平，實爲一大打擊。同時華萊士本人在宣佈辭職之後也表示：「余決定繼續爲和平而奮鬥，余相信美國人民，均能以故總統羅斯福之英勇精神，加入余所領導的鬥爭。」準此而論，華氏的去職，對於今年初冬衆議院改選，勢將發生若干重大影響。</p>
<p>但是我們檢討一下美國的政黨政治，即可知：華萊士今後將採取何種政治路綫，實在也是一個嚴重的問題。緣美國百餘年來，僅有民主與共和兩大政黨，第三黨迄未成長。約在三十年前，賴福萊特參議員雖曾企圖組織第三黨，這就是進步黨，但其勢力僅限於威斯康辛一州而已。此外，還有一個勞工黨，除了紐約一州而外，在其他各州也都沒有它的黨員，因此也很雖成爲有力的第三黨。我們姑且假定華氏將依賴工業組織大會政治行動委員會的支持，但是一般美國人民，都視該會爲共產黨的機關，似乎很難獲得美國大多數人民的擁護。</p>
<p>美國現政府內在的裂痕，雖因華萊士辭職而歸於一致，但是美國對於如何締造世界和平，仍是當前最嚴重的問題。華萊士辭職後發表演說稱：「余不信將地球分爲兩個世界，全將繼續主張生活於一個世界的一項原則，除了『四海一家』而外，即無和平可言」。他又指摘杜魯門政府外交政策的錯誤，謂其未能認淸引起兩次世界大戰的「基本事實」，而今又威脅第三次大戰矣，但第三次大戰將爲「原子戰爭」。這一個嚴重的警吿，的確値得杜魯門總統與貝爾納斯深思的。但是美國怎樣始能造成「四海一家」的世界，而不致分裂爲兩個集團？這却又是一個値得我們硏究的問題了。華萊士在其上社魯門總統書內，竟宜稱美國海陸軍界有一派人士正在計劃，以「先發制人」的手段加諸蘇聯。這種言論，誰也不會置信，且已經海陸兩部長予以否認，足見這成僅是華氏的敏感或幻想而已。我們認爲有遠見的政治家，不應先存此幻想，更不宜隨便發表。因爲這種幻想的存在，很容易引起不幸的災難，不僅國際合作有此作梗而不能實現，而且列强間的猜疑與誤食，也將愈結愈深，永遠不能消除了。</p>

<h3>和會未獲合理結果前　美蘇巨頭不致會晤　白宮新聞秘書羅斯昨宣布</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎二十一日緊急廣播華盛頓訊：白宮新聞秘書羅斯今晨宣稱：巴黎和會如不克獲致合理之和平，則杜營門總統將直接會晤史達林之說，並不確實。羅斯並稱：自華來士餅職以來，杜營門並未獲得貝爾納斯方面任何訊息，至於華萊士之繼任人選，今日尚不致公佈雲。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓二十日電〕自杜營門總統命令內長伊克斯自動辭職，迄今僅歷數月，而商務部長華萊士奉令辭職。華萊士爲故總統羅斯神福新政時代碩果僅存之部長，茲亦退出杜營門政府矣，今後　將採取何種政治路線，此際尚未可知，美國面數十年以來僅有兩大政黨，即限於威斯康新一州。此外尚有勞工黨，但除紐約一州面外，並無黨員。華萊士嗣後或將依賴工爲組織大會政治行動委員會之支持，殆無　義。惟美國人士當以該會爲一共黨機關，華萊士此後是否將遷居紐約，抑或仍留華盛頓，尚不可知。</p>

<h3>華萊士發表廣播演說　決爲爭取和平奮鬥　維護「世界一體」概念　推崇羅斯福善鄰政策</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二十日電〕商務部長華萊士辭職後，今晨向全力廣播。略謂，「爭取和平，較之高官厚實錄尤爲重要，較之政黨政治之顧慮尤爲重要。余曾於星期三向杜魯門總統面允暫不發言，總統今次舉動，已恢復余之自由發言權。余前在麥迪遜廣場所發表之演說，有數點曾引起廣大之誤解，允宜予以糾正。華萊士續稱，「余將爲和平而繼續奮鬥，希望國人參加此種神聖天責。我國目前之外交政策，不認識現實，此種現實曾迅導致兩次世界大戰，現有發生另一次戰爭之虞，此次且將原子彈戰爭。遠在十五看前，余即主張世界一家政策，余不信兩個世界。除非處於一個世界，吾人不能獲得和平。茲欲再度　明者，一切帝國主義及侵略，無論出自蘇聯英國或美國，均爲余所反對。同時復須聲明世界一家之概念，務須固守，若欲給予世界經濟與政治的現實性以實施方式，而有採取地域主義之必要時，亦必顧到小國之利益，一如西半球各小國在羅斯福總統善鄰政策下所享有者然。任何政策之成就，最後寄於人民之信賴與意志」。</p>
<h3>民主黨分裂　影響下屆選舉</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山二十一日廣播：華萊士之辭職，立即使各方猜測渠是否將使民主黨分裂而組第三個政黨。但消息靈通人士均認爲華萊士將在民主黨內爭取自由思想之勝利。各方以爲華萊士之脫離內閣，將使共和黨在下屆先舉中獲勝，因民主黨陣營發生裂痕故也。</p>

<h3>市參議會昨日重要決議　救濟失學兒童　提高教育經費　撤枝機關廢房損附加費　促請加速徵收地價稅</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本年下半年度，市政府究竟應該收入多少？付出多少？不敷多少？不敷的數目又是怎樣彌補？這一個爲四百萬市民所密切注意的重要議案，在昨天下午大會中展開了最熱烈最精彩的辯論之一幕。雖然因爲時間關係，確定的數字及彌補的辦法尙待下星期一再來決定，但是幾項重要的原則，已經順利通過：（一）敎育經費應至少增列爲總預算百分之二十，尤顯特別注重國民敎育之普及。（二）地價稅之微收應由市府督成地政局根據國父遺敎積極推進，務期於本年以內完成。（三）房損內附加之保衛團服裝費及夏令防疫經費應予立即取消。（四）房屋租賃管理委員會無再繼續之必要，應予裁撤。（五）警察局臨巡隊應子裁撤。（六）參談員車馬費仍予冽入，但自願放棄者應繳還市庫。</p>
<p>原先市府所編製的預算收支相抵不敷計三百三十三億餘元，經過第九小組委員會慎重審核之下，應加的加，應减的减，結果不敷牧减至二百零三億餘元。提出大會討論的詳細數字如下表所示：一，原列歲入預算總數五一，三九〇，三六三，〇一五元</p>
<p>加：擬增加之歲入預算數三，七五六，一〇〇，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>總計五五，一四六，四六三，〇一五元二，原列歲出預算總數八四，七一七，五二一，八〇〇元</p>
<p>减：（甲）照預算數擬酌予减除者　二，三九五，三六一，〇五〇元</p>
<p>（乙）購置修繕費照</p>
<p>原預算核减三成　五〇六，三六四，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>（丙）一般行政經費</p>
<p>照原預算核减一成半　七，八七五，九〇一，四九四元</p>
<p>加：擬新增之歲出預算數　一，五五六，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>總計　七五，四九五，八九五，二五六元三，收支不數數二〇，三四九，四三二，二四一元</p>
<p>徐永祚報告審查結果　並說細解釋增減各點</p>
<p>第九小組的召集人，沈永祚會計師除將該組審査經過報吿以外並將上述數字詐細加以解釋。其中歲入方面擬增加的數字係根據原有稅源上半年度的實際徵收情形酌量予以增减，計使用牌照稅收入照原預算增加一倍，筵席娛樂稅收入增加一成，新車登記費收入增加五成，屠宰稅收入增加一倍，淸潔收入增加二成，公用公司報酬金收入增加一成，學費及尊師金收入則减去尊師金部份。歲出方面，經常部門剔除的有（一）房屋租賃管理員會經費，（二）警察局騎巡隊經費。减少的爲補助及協助費支出。臨時部門减少的爲（一）市參議會開會經費，（二）市政府秘書處公報印刷及廣吿金，（三）房屋租賃管理委員會購置修理費，（四）敎育局車輛油價費，（五）私校及機關補助費，（六）公用局電氣事業設備費。剔除的則有市立平民醫院開辦費。</p>
<p>徐氏特別指出：此次預算無論在編造方面和審核方面均因時間侷促而有粗略之感。不過議會審査預算與主計或審計機關不同，祇能從大處着眼而作籠統的增减。不必規定得太剛性以免使執行時有窒礙的情形。</p>
<p>報吿完畢以後，大會就開始討諭這一個審査結果。在討論中間，潘議長綜合各參議員的意見，對於現行稅制及若干行政上不合理的地方嚴厲指摘，慷慨陳詞，在全塲最熱烈的掌聲中通過了幾項重要的決定。</p>
<p>討論教育經費</p>
<p>最先提出的是敎育經費的問題。根據憲草規定敎育經費至少應佔地方總經費百分之三十，現在審査委員會核减以後祇佔到總預算百分之十九還不到。周斐成第一個向大會呼籲，他指出敎育事業在今日中國的重要，敎育經費應該有獨立的性質，主張至少應該提高到總預算百分之二十以上。蔣紀周孫震春岑志良等亦紛紛補充意見，特別提出今日失學兒童之衆多，國民學校亟應增設，經費如何還可减少？</p>
<p>議長發表結論</p>
<p>議長對這問題下了痛快的結論，他說：「敎育事業當然最爲重要，現在敎育經費所佔百分比太低，我們主張在市府重編預算時應將敎育經費至少改爲佔總預算百分之二十，從各種費用裏統籌彌補，允應特別注重國民敎育的普及，敎育局應該把重點放在國民敎育上。當今日許許多多兒童都還沒有讀書機會的時候，有許多不必要的不急需的事情就不應該辦。舉個例說：如戲劇學校之類儘可停辦，我們先要解決小孩子的失學問題，決沒有閒錢來辦裝飾品！」他的主張在熱烈的掌聲中一致無異議通過。</p>
<p>落伍的警政設施　騎巡隊決裁撤　保衛團服裝費與防疫經費　同時表決一致取消</p>
<p>房捐中附徵的保衛團服裝費和防疫經費此次預算山依舊列入，討論時沈鼎提出取消，他認爲橫豎收支不敷，同樣要開源，凡是此種名不副實的或者已失時間性的稅收都應取消。表決結果多數贊成取消，由此而减少的十八億元收入，加入不敷數內另行籌劃</p>
<p>關於警察局騎巡隊的問題，宣局長昨天曾致函參議會略述本市市區遼闊，道路崎嶇，騎巡隊鎭壓作用最爲顯著，請爲顧及治安，予以維持云云。討論中有人認爲騎巡隊已是一種落伍的警政設施，有人則指出警察局因爲接收了一批敵產馬匹才成立騎巡隊，事實上上海不需要這種馬隊，有人則主張保留但須駐紥至郊外去，表決給果贊成保留的僅十四票，決議裁撤。</p>
<p>最後一個有趣的討論是參議員本身的車馬費問題：剛提出的時候不少參議員表示不要拿這筆費用，把預算剔除。忽然副議長徐　老說話了，他說：「我們事實上雖然不在乎這筆車馬費，但旣然有道一個規定我們也不必客氣。」費樹聲則認爲這一個問題根本不應該付討論表決，這是議會組縱上的規定，議員應享的權利，除非自己願意放棄，否則，即使全體通過這筆費用不列入預算，他個人還是要向市政府拿。</p>
<p>本案因此不再討論，如有自願放棄的則由參議會退回市庫。</p>
<p>市府預算問題　提出建議三點</p>
<p>在具體討論預算數字以前，議長臨時提出幾個重要的建議：</p>
<p>（一）參議會對於預算支出之核减僅作總數的決定，至於如何酌量支配，應由市政府統盤籌劃，斟酌事務繁簡，人員多少，破除情面，自行決定裁員簡政辦法。</p>
<p>（二）此次預算經參議會核定以後，應由市府於最短期內根據決議重編預算以備査核。</p>
<p>（三）三十六年度預算應連同參考資料於本年十一月底以前送達參議會，在第二次大會時提出討論，以免臨時侷促，審核不週。</p>
<p>這三項建議均經全體一致通過。</p>
<p>臨時動議兩項</p>
<p>昨日上午參議會中，討論馮有眞等參議員提出之臨時動議：「冬令轉瞬即屆，擬咨請市政府迅予核發臨時救濟費一億〇五百六十七萬元，以資適時購辦難童冬季被服，是否有當，提請公決案。」因漕河涇難童收容所收養難童一千七百名，開支浩大，需款股切。大會通過決議案：「請市府在預算範圍內，儘先撥款購置。」</p>
<p>另有一臨時動議係張中原等提「建議經濟部，關於接收敵偽產　工廠，如繼續出品，應更改其牌號及裝璜，以正觀瞻案。議長稱：「經濟部接收各廠，出品極多，請大家愼重考慮。」各參議員中有認爲更改所有接收之敵偽工廠出品牌號，恐有不便。李文杰稱：「例如德孚洋行出品之陰丹士林，巳爲社會應用上所普遍採用，倘也更改，頗有妨礙。」結果大會議決撤銷本案。</p>
<p>地價稅延不徵收　參議員羣起責難　開源之道尤應盡力督徵舊稅　稅收人員中飽舞弊必須根絕</p>
<p>地價稅的徵收爲什麼到現在還不能積極舉辦，參議員對於這一點的責難最爲激烈，地政局長祝平昨天又被請上台來解釋，他說：「地價稅的徵收必須先求地籍整理完成，因爲上海以前是租界，情形比較複雜，祇能一區一孤的辦理。今春財政部地政署曾經派人會同市政府商議過一個計劃並核定經費三十億元預計在下半年內完成，但直至現在這筆經費還沒有領到，僅由市政府每月籌撥一千餘萬元來應付，所以不能够迅速辦妥，希望這次預算通過以後，在本年內能够徵收到一部份。」</p>
<p>瞿鉞走上主席台發表意見，他認爲不能老是等下去，未經淸丈的土地可以定出一種過渡辦法來先行徵稅。　議長此時又發表了警闢的讜論，他說：「我們求開源除了增闢新稅以外尤應盡力督徵舊稅，在不增加稅率的原則下使收人增加，現在所列的預算收入是不一定可靠的，其中許多恐怕都將進入稅收人員的荷包裏去，這種中飽舞弊的情形必須切實革除。至於土地稅，國父遺敎中有明文規定，現在應該先定一個過渡辦法來徵收。」因此他建議「所有原則各項稅收市府應令飭主管當局努力督徵，根除中飽舞弊情形，尤以地價稅必須提早徵收以增加收入。」</p>
<p>詹文辯對於議長的意見再加補充，他覺得目前不合理的稅收狀况下眞正負担的都是些平民，有地產的人也未嘗不肯負担，怪祇怪政府無能！所以他要地政局負起責任，表現出能力，無論如何要在這半年內理出頭緒來。</p>
<p>顧錦藻認爲戶籍登記的辦法繁冗費時應該力加改善。姜屛藩主張由地政局根據國父遺敎中報價辦法即日辦理。徐永祚則認爲報價手續辦起來恐怕又非一年半載所能完成，還是應該先定過渡辦法，始能眞正達到立即增加稅收的目的。</p>
<p>最後歸納各人意見通過原則建議市府責成地政局積極推進地價稅之徵收，務須於本年以內完成。</p>
<p>特種現金保證　建議中央採用</p>
<p>關於金字第九號提案，建議採用特種現金保證制度案，日前送交第四第十兩組審査後，略有刪改，將原規則第三條廢除。審査意見爲二建議中央採用，特種現金保證制度，原擬方案，附呈中央參考。大會決議，照審査意見通過。</p>
<p>普設牙科治療機構　設置人工免費病床</p>
<p>市參議會昨日上午舉行第十九决會議，繼續討論衛生及社會方面提案。多順利通過。</p>
<p>關於衛生方面提案，第七號：「請市府普設牙科治療機稱，以增進市民健康案」。決定辦法一種：「各市立醫院，應兼設牙科，一爲牙病者施普通之治療。二爲有關各科疾病之輔助診斷，及治療之助」。決議通過。第八號「請市政府轉飭市警察局所屬，保障醫療技術人員身體自由案一。無異議通過。第九號：「請市政府設置產業工人免費病床，以　進工人健表案」。刪除案由中「產業」二字，通過。第十號：「强迫施種牛痘案」，無異議通過</p>
<p>促進勞資合作　發展民族工業</p>
<p>關於社會救濟及勞工之提案，經第七審查小組歸納爲第十二案，其中社字第二號提案：「促進勞資合作，發展民族工業案」，經大會修正通過。所決定辦法，有舉辦勞資合作工廠，公平處理勞資爭議，實行工廠會議等。</p>
<p>社字第三號提案，爲「改善配售制度，抑平物價案」。審査意見爲「擬請大會通過，咨送市府實施」。吳市長請議長允許對此點加以說明，略稱：對於配售制度，本人絕對贊成，唯目前之困難爲政府當局尙不能充份控制交通，同時市府物資，也不够普遍分配。例如食米，現在一方面由商人自由採運銷售，另一方面市府　有大量食米，可以隨時拋售，抑平米價。倘全由市府配售，目前可能有恐慌之虞。請大會愼重考慮。馮有眞提議，咨送市府斟酌辦理，決議通過。</p>
<p>添設公典　減低利息</p>
<p>社字第四號，案由係「爲典當業月息浩大，期限短促，提請市政當局重予規定，令飭遵照，以資救濟貧民，安定社會案」。各參議員討論結果，認爲利息應儘量減低，由社會局規定之，如有實際困難，應由市府主管機關，代向國家銀行或市銀行，商借低利貸款補助之。期限暫以六個月爲滿期，到期時並得准其付息轉票。同時並添設公典，利息不應超過一角，由市府主管機關，代向國家銀行或市銀行，商借低利貸舉辦之。其舉辦地點，以平民住宅區爲主。</p>
<p>社字第五號，擬請市政府辦理農民福利事業，繁榮農村，並轉呈農林部將接收之上海經濟農產，劃一部份爲示範農產案」。修正通過。第六號「應請推行國民義務勞動法，以協助開發郊區案」。大會決議「木案臨參會已有決議，督促市政府施行」。第七號「積極救濟失業職工案」。提出六項辦法，大會無異議通過。</p>
<p>重整道德　轉移風氣</p>
<p>社字第八號「重整道德，轉移社會風氣，以勵行新生活運動，爲當前急務案」。仝道雲提議應於案由中加入「提倡早市」一點，並說明早起與身體健康，節省電力之關係。多數參議員認爲辦法巾已有「提倡早市」之規定，不必重覆，未獲通過。趙仰雄主張應於辦法中加「請市政府增撥新生活運動事業費」一項，因新生活運動着重宣傳工作，非錢莫辦。議長將此點提付表決時，趙仰雄又起立稱：「請各位注意，倘大家不贊成增加這項辦法，那麼本案將毫無意義」。表決多數通過。最後大會決議，送請市政府轉咨新生活運動促進會切實施行。所定辦法，尚有規定每月第一星期爲新生活巡動週，全體官民，一致遵行。取締一切不良影片及不正當之娛樂等。</p>
<p>社字第九號，案由爲「擬加强社會救濟事業，以實現三民主義之社會政策案」。所列辦法共計八點，由大會修正通過。</p>
<p>八十六票造成撤銷　房屋租賃管理會　命運決定</p>
<p>在十九日晚上第九組舉行最後一次審査預算會的時候，召集人徐永祚曾報告審査結果，認爲「節流」起見，市府各機關中凡是可以核减或裁撤的機構，都應該撤銷，所以把「房屋租賃管理委員會」也列入被撤之列。當時曾引起第十組召集人朱扶九的反對，認爲房屋租賃管理委員會支出經費極有限，如撤銷後需支遣散費等所剩無幾，而該會調處房屋租賃糾紛實有存在的必要。可是在座的人多數主張取銷，同時據潘議長表示省錢多少不計，這個機關在事實上不是非存在不可，就應該取銷。結果這個案十是規定保留交大會討論。</p>
<p>於是，在昨日討論預算的大會上，關於房屋租　管理委員會的裁撤問題，又再度引起了一番熱烈的辯論。結果是決定了該會應該「壽終正寢」。可是這個案子討論非常精彩，造成了昨日大會中最熱鬧緊張的一幕。</p>
<p>在議長預備付表決之前，陶百川首先說明關於這問題曾在第十組審査法規時費了許多時間硏究，根據法律認爲此會有存在之理由，同時該會經費僅佔總預算七百分之一，堅持在未經召集人朱扶九解釋以前，和大會未予辯論之前，不能即付表決。可是議長報吿經他和吳市長談話結果，市長認爲房屋租賃管理委員會在法律上並無根據，可以裁撤。因爲勞資糾紛，法院不予受理，所以成立了一個勞資評斷委員會，然而房屋租賃糾紛法院可以受理，自不必另設機構，參議會儘管裁好了。但據朱扶九的聲明，關於房屋租賃糾紛的案件非常多，法院雖能受理，但所費時間一定很久，一件案子也許要費一年才能辦好。同時該會經費僅一萬三千萬元，不到總預算的七百分之一，在預算上影響極小。最後根據法律，在憲法尙未施行前，根據國民政府民國三十二年現行法規整理規則，關於地方需要法規，則國防最高委員會委員長之命令與法令有同等效力。地方所需法規雖經地方當局通過後，仍應補辦立法順序，但在未補辦前依舊有效，市長說無法律根據，希望市長再予硏究。所以他的結論是（一）在法律上絕對有根據，（二）經費不多，（三）現在房屋租賃管理會組織如果不滿，將來可以澈底改革。</p>
<p>接着瞿鉞說：我和房屋租賃管理會並無怨恨，但此會之成立在法律上實無根據，房屋租賃管理會乃根據戰時房屋租賃條例所成立，現在該條例已撤銷，管理會亦應取銷。後來有人提議保留到星期一討諭，廟京周反對說：七百分之一的項目還要延到星期一討論，樣全部預算不知到幾時才討論得完。結果在八十六票多數贊成取銷之下，房屋租賃管理委員會的命運就被決定，該會的五十八個職員，十二個工役，也將被裁掉了。</p>
<p>恭祝元首花甲榮慶　通電全國一致舉行</p>
<p>社字第一號提案，係一擬由本會發動民衆團體組織州慶祝元首花甲榮慶籌備會，建立永久紀念，以示崇德報功案。一昨以一〇一票多數通過，決定四項辦法：（一）由本會通函全市各民衆團體，組織慶祝元首花甲榮慶籌備會。（二）由本會推派代表二人參加籌備會。（大會決定推選正副議長參加。）（三）由籌備會援照五旬榮慶獻機祝壽成例，妥擬慶祝辦法，樹立更有意義之永久紀念。（四）通電各省市參議會一致進行。</p>
<p>參加清查團　五參議員工作報告</p>
<p>參加淸査團辦公之五參議員趙君豪·何元明·朱學範·王劍諤·馬君碩·昨向參議會大會報吿稱：同人等奉派出席接收處理工作淸査團，參加工作，於本月十六日接獲該團聘書，即於翌日上午前往報到，並於十八日第一次出席該團例會，同人等以本會係上海市地方民意機關，今後淸査工作似應以地方機關爲對象，較爲合理，經會同向團長陳述，當承指示，旣經加入該團工作，即爲團員之一，不必作硬性規定，惟允於此後支配工作時，當儘可能以地方案件分派處理云云。是日並決定處理重要案件兩起：（一）爲市府接收敵偽車輛交萬泰修理折價案，（二）爲市府出售中央市塲物資四十二億元案，以上兩案業經上次會議時決定送法院偵査，此次開會經秘書報吿，並正式製成決議，同人等以初次出席，案情未明，故未表示意見，嗣由團長指定王劍諤。馬君碩·何元明三人査閱第二案全卷，就法律觀點硏究，僉認本件涉於行政處分之範圍較多，似應由原調查人將有關法律部份予以注意比較妥當，查淸査團第一組之編制爲委員三人，即張團長知本，程監察使中行。及吳委員望伋等，嗣又爲張委員慶楨，范委員爭波加入，故較規定之編制增多二人，同人等係以參議員資格加人，故在職權上似有區別，就性質論，僅站在協助地位。査淸査團第一組自來滬開始工作以來，即向各接收機關一函索接收報吿，並囑準備接收淸册，俾便隨時調閱，目前已送報吿者計六十九單位，始終無答覆者僅外事局及戰犯管理處。至人民密吿方面，截至九月十九日止爲三百十三件，茲分列如次：</p>
<p>關於密吿房屋土地糾紛四十八件，關於密吿接收舞弊二十六件，關於密吿處理敵偽物資不當或違法舞弊三十二件，關於密吿隱匿敵偽物資三十三件，關於密吿處理局不發獎金四十三件，關於密吿請求發還被佔財物四十五件，關於檢舉各種舞弊雜類密吿八十六件，據秘書徐隆川面吿，上列各項案件已予處理，初査結束者約爲百分之八十左右，同人等係在淸査團將吿結束之階段內加入工作，故對於已經辦理結束之案件，似不再覆査，事實上亦無權覆査，此後當在團長領導之下工作，並擬於本會大會休會後，輪値到會辦公，惟淸査期限亦無明顯規定，同人等極願於下次報吿時，作一有具體化之報吿，尙祈議長副議長及諸全體同人隨時予以指示及督促」云。</p>
<h3>百老匯大厦决予標售　底價內定爲一百十億　六十餘幢敵產同時出售　當局負責在兩週內出清</h3>

<h3>日短夜漸長　供應愈困難　籲請節省用電　電力公司再發緊急通告　準備採取擴大限制辦法</h3>
<p>上海電力公司，因冬季將臨，市民用電需要增加，故昨日再度發出緊急通吿，分別通知各用戶，對於普通用戶，準備採取擴大限制辦法，冬季暖室電力，亦可能停止供給。該公司並懇切籲請各界人士，節省用電。華東社記者昨向本市電力主管當局獲悉，該公司戰前發電容量共達一八三·〇〇〇瓩，現祇一一九·〇〇〇瓩，其中尙須讓出二六·〇〇〇瓩，供給閘北華商及南市三電氣公司，供應南市，閘北，浦東，吳淞，眞茹一帶市民應用，故實際上上海電力公司及該公司附設之滬西電力公司，祇剩九三。〇〇〇瓩，每月不敷頗鉅。據悉：目前用電量，已超過該公司楊樹浦發電廠容量一五·〇〇○瓩。該公司爲應付此種情况，目前已與大宗工業用戶，如紗廠等，商妥一種每日輪流停電辦辦法，幷將大紗廠按日停工時間，變更在下午六時至十時，並對於申請新接或增加電熱及工業電力負荷等均已停辦，以勉維過度時期之難關。當局雖已協助該公司多方設法訂購新機，並修理損壞機件，但在明年一月底以前，難望增加發電。該公司因現狀已難維持，轉瞬冬令即屆，日短夜長，市民用電，更將增加，電力恐慌勢將益形嚴重，故　請市民節電，吾則必將採取擴大限制辦法，以及其他可能之必要措施云。</p>

<h3>「開桃園」盜古董　倫兒又告活躍　協大祥　損失亦大</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕「摸竊大隊」的行列，在人們腦海裏還沒有消逝，可是這幾天竊兒們却又在活躍起來了。</p>
<p>昨天淸早，西愛咸斯路六百廿七號梁藏生的家裏給竊兒光顧了，而且接連表演了二套技術—「開桃園」和「揚兩面光」，即掘了竹籬笆，再敲碎玻璃窗。結果，陳列在會客廳裏的名貴古董幾件，銅鏡一面，長方型玉水盂大小各一只，藍花瓶一只，和掛在衣架上的呢帽二頂，雨衣七件，還有無綫電收音機一架，均被搬走。這樣的行動，時間當然很長，但始終未曾使主人知覺，直到七點鐘，主人起身後，才發覺失竊了這許多東西，馬上報吿警局。他說無綫電，呢帽，雨衣等損失還小，大約廿多萬元，但幾件古董却難以估計了·經警局派員在出事地點調査後，發覺這個　明的竊賊竟一絲沒有痕跡遺落，因此這件無頭案的確很傷警員的腦筋呢！</p>

<h3>偽部長傳式說昨審結　四證人作有利被吿之陳述　法官出示大宗證件　訊明諭定廿八宣判</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕偽府巨頭之一，歷任「鐵道部長」「浙江省長兼保安司令」「建設部長」等職之傳式說案，自本年四月間由高等法院合議庭一度審訊後，即延攔至今。昨日上午在提籃橋高院刑一庭更新審理，辯論終結，定本月二十八日宣判。</p>
<p>十時一刻劉毓桂庭長偕曹駿·邱煥瀛兩推事及戴榮鐸檢察官·李錦章書記官升座後，即命法警押上被吿。傳身衣暗灰長衫，足穿黃褐色皮鞋，剃平頂頭，髮已斑白，面色萎黃，手持眼鏡盒，精神衰頒。首由庭上詢明現年五十六歲，浙江溫州人，最後担任之偽職，係「建設部長」。劉庭長繼宣稱：按照程序，今日本案更新審理。在調査期間，本院會向浙江省政府，交通部等調集有關證據。被吿所提出之證據，亦已一一向鎭江·杭州等地調査，現皆有覆文到來。至此被吿之辯護律師即起立聲稱：今日有爲被吿作證者四人到案，請庭上傳詢。劉庭長即命傳退旁梢坐。光問證人</p>
<p>何培榮</p>
<p>稱：抗戰時期，祖任兩路黨部主任委員兼第三戰區宣導員。卅三年初，來滬秘密工作，得彼吿掩護。六月間並隨被吿去南京，與偽府商定策反工作計劃，但因敵人突然投降，遂未實現。</p>
<p>毛敬泉</p>
<p>稱：先父毛暈在抗戰時期負責軍統局在京滬一帶之工作。被吿任偽鐵道部長時，雙方即有聯絡。時杭州嘉興一帶工作機關，紛紛爲敵憲兵隊破獲，人員皆被捕，先父亦在其內。被吿曾親自往敵憲兵隊說情，但未有結果。後經託人用錢買通裏面之翻譯及隊長，將證據消滅，乃獲釋出。上海一帶之工作機關，亦得賴以保全。後先父去重慶時，委員長曾傳令嘉獎。卅一年重回上海工作，時被吿任偽浙江省長，乃去杭見被吿，曾親自去省府三次，接洽將浙省軍權全部交出，以謀策反。但爲敵得悉，被吿因之去省長職。後在偽建設部長任內，又多方掩護工作。先父後得病亡故，其在生前隨時指示被吿，被吿亦隨時供給情報。</p>
<p>王毓祥</p>
<p>係大夏大學創辦人之一，爲被吿證明兩點：（一）卅二年，偽敎育部令大夏大學，將員生名册造報。經校董會議決置之不理，至實在無辦法時關門。一面又因本案被吿過去亦曾在大夏担任敎授，乃託其向偽敎育部轉言，勿對敎育界加以摧殘。因之如大同·復旦等大學，皆得安然存在。（二）民國卅年時，政府與偽方之地下工作人員，在滬爭鬥甚烈。某日大夏有一學生出校門時，被人擊斃。後經査明該生係偽組織人員。「七十六號」乃來函威逼亦係，託本案被吿帮忙了結者。</p>
<p>龔蔚珍</p>
<p>稱：卅二年一月，因參加黨團工作，全家被敵憲兵州隊拘捕，送常州禁閉三月。嗣因本人與被吿之妻相識，經被吿營救獲釋。外子亦得減刑。</p>
<p>圖卸罪　必先表功</p>
<p>四證人詢間畢，庭上即問被吿對此有何話說，答稱有幾點意見補充：（一）本人當初被敵憲兵隊所捕，逼迫參加偽府，曾徵得毛　之同意，此事毛敬泉不知。（二）何培榮祇言及一部份。另卅一年下半年，營救忠義救國軍第二團第三營營長孔敬士及其部下卅多人，名義上向敵憲兵隊保釋，由我們訓練。至後調往餘姚轉蕪湖放走。（三）被吿素在敎育界服務，已達二十年，當初偽府本邀我負責敎育，未就。趙正平任偽敎育部長時，上海敎育界大起恐慌，本人乃向趙進言，聽任上海敎育界自由維持下去，不必干涉。</p>
<p>眞憑實據</p>
<p>劉庭長繼以被吿在偽國府還都紀念册上發表之「中日化化協會與中日文文合作」一文見示，問有何話說。答：此係空洞文章，是在鐵道部時由秘書所寫。庭上繼以向各機關吊來之大批證件出示被吿，包括偽鐵道部擬呈偽行政院徵收偽華中鐵道公司股本，偽行政院指令被吿赴日視察鐵道事業，並出席第二次「東亞經濟懇談會」。僞鐵適部令偽華中鐵道公司指定各種運費價格等等之規章，偽建設部關於舉辦建設公債發行之辦法，及關於中日合辦公司之監督及管理條文，偽浙江省淸鄕計劃及實施辦法，協助敵登部隊採辦木材等軍用品，實行保安制度及施政方針。又淸鄕計劃中關於保安隊方案之重點在協力日軍之軍事行動，以確立治安等大批卷宗。被告閱後大部承認，但稱：關於中日合辦公司之監督及管理條文，係僞實業部長陳君慧所擬。淸鄕計劃中所稱之重點，係由偽淸鄕委員會發下。名義上淸鄭由僞府實施，實際係日軍在幹。確立浙省保安制度係因有甚多雜色部隊在日人支配下，狐借虎威，騷擾地方。乃向日人交涉，　中國方面管理。成立後，對武力一點，日人甚爲反對。平均一百人中祇二三十枝舊槍。詢問畢已十二時，即開始辯論，先由檢察官論吿，再山被吿之辯護律師章士釗，顧　等答辯，至一時許始畢。庭諭二十八日宣判。</p>

<h3>江灣處處淘金　日兵埋藏　老嫗覓寳</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕繼外傳本市復興島有敵海軍埋藏巨額金條被人吞沒之消息後，本市江灣一帶又發生敵之埋藏金條而引起之第二起淘金案。</p>
<p>緣前日本駐滬警備司令部登部隊，曾在台灣·上海搜購大批金條，並於去夏由日軍裝載於大卡車數輛運至江灣引翔路交叉附近，理藏於一防空洞內。事爲附近一農　所窺見，惟當時因有日哨兵戒嚴，距離頗遠，且時値夜間，不能察着淸楚。嗣後該防空洞已被塡平，惟該老嫗曾隻身頻往掘金，並對此事秘而不官，後經鄉鄰窺悉，始吐露實情，致最近一週來，江灣機塲，前市中心，前登部隊營部，及江灣跑馬廳一帶，陸續有居民携鏟荷鋤，爭相掘洞覓寳。甚至在虹口公園內挖掘者，亦比比皆是。此事如何處理，各方均極注意，刻正待當局予以調査後核辦。</p>

<h3>本市工商界四團體　招待蒲樂開茶會　對我勞工現狀表示須予改善　並希望埋頭苦幹完成工業化</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市市商會，總工會，中國工業協會，中國勞動協會等四團體，昨日下午四時，假國際飯店自由廳，聯合歡迎應聘來華考察之國際勞工局參事蒲樂開氏。出席者有市商會王曉籟。壽景偉，總工會水祥雲，全國工業協會上海分會吳蘊初。中國勞動協會朱學範，社會局副局長李劍華，社會部工訓司長陸京士，國際勞工局中國分局長程海峯，吳市長代表錢乃信，及工商界胡西園·章子衡·洪念祖·王人麟·仇長江等百餘人。由壽景偉主席，吳蘊初代表致詞，略稱：國際勞工局之組織，在使世界各國間之勞工有了迪絡。中國抗戰八年來，受盡敵人威脅摧殘，唯有國際間友人，（尤其是勞工方面）給我們的幫助是値得憶念的。英美等盟國，不但給予精神上的幫助，同時也給予物質上的（如捐款等）幫助，這其間，國際勞工局的努力是不可抹殺的。此次蒲樂開先生應聘來華，相信對於中國勞工之福利，必有幫助。中國是個工業落後的國家，工業設備及工人待遇等均不如人，我們希望蒲樂開先生給予有力的幫助，謹代表本市工人歡迎並致敬意。繼由中國勞動協會代表等致詞歡迎後，蒲樂開氏即發表演說：被首先表示對於工商界四團體之聯合歡迎衷心感謝，並表示極大的愉快。繼介紹國際勞工局組織之目的爲謀取勞工之福利，此番受中國社會部之聘請來華，希望能促使中國勞工局與之取得密切之合作，並稱孫中山先生所提倡之三民主義與國際勞工局之方針完全符合，如保護勞工爲民族主義，謀勞資雙方之合作爲民權主義，改善勞工生活則爲民生主義。蒲氏來華後，經過二星期之觀察，認爲中國目前之勞工現狀，猶如南京路上之交通情形：人力車，三輪車，機動車等攪做一團，紊亂不堪。此種不合理之現象，必須予以改善。蒲氏末稱：世界各國，都希望中國能成爲一工業化的國家，中國必須增加生產，埋頭苦幹。預祝自由民主主義，能引導中國走上富强之路。國際勞工局中國分局局長程海峯致詞，謂今天作柬之四個團體單位，代表了兩種不同的立塲和利益——即勞方與資方，希望此係中國勞資協調之先聲。社會局副局長李劍華稱：國際勞工局所訂定之改善勞工界原則，對於中國是非常重要的。譬如八小時工作制，是早經國際勞工局決定的，現在上海已普遍買現。並稱：今日的中國工業，已面臨最大危機，中國經過長期戰爭中之破壞，不但應使其復原，並且更應促其超過原有之成績。這個工作是艱難的，在這危急的階段，必須勞資互相諒解，澈底合作。末由社會部工礦檢査處　　長　開蓮致詞後，大會於五時</p>

<h3>對兩路局大舞弊案　陳伯莊發表談話　撤換張鴻圖張伯康早具決心　郁香嚴信口雌黃不值一笑</h3>
<p>京滬區路局材料處長强鴻　　舞弊案，前日首次開審後，社會人士對此案甚爲注意。記者特意訪該路局長陳伯莊承答覆如次：</p>
<p>（一）本人旬日來遵率部令，計劃明年全年度建設，十分忙碌，對於此案審訊全部消息，實無暇注意。惟前閱新聞報十四日載張鴻圖之辯護狀第一段稱，張伯康係本人帶來，非彼之私人，且彼曾請更換張伯康，而本八不肯者，其用意無非洗脫彼與張伯康之關係，不得不將眞相相吿：（一）張鴻圖及張伯康同係材料司職員，在去年本入奉命接收京滬區前，均素昧平生，張伯康由部派爲接收隨員，張鴻圖由部派爲材料處長，而張伯康之被派爲採購課長，則由張鴻圖所呈請。（二）本年四月，局內外對材料處已有閒話，其時本人曾向經濟部特派員張茲閱，前交通部式長現大連市長沈怡，行政院秘書尹仲容先生等請舉薦採購課長人選，其時張特派員曾　有妥員，卒因該員奉翁副院長派往華北辦接收工作，故無成議，幷曾將此事吿知張鴻圖，彼旣知本人決心更換彼所請派之張伯康，故曾另推薦材料司某人接替，大概怕本人另找到與彼素不相識之人，故又薦熟人以爲抵制掩護，本人當然不加考慮。</p>
<p>（二）此案未發前，材料司華司長壽嵩曾吿本人，謂兪樵峯部長於卸事之前一月，已風聞張鴻圖不妥，曾令華司長密查，但兪部長並未同樣密令本人，因此本人決心將張鴻圖更換，隨向兪大維部長請另派人，但大維部長一時無適當人選可派，因此本人於五月廿八令所有採購均須秉承副局長侯或華辦理。此令下後，局內員司均知本人對材料處不信任，且無私人關係，翌日即貼有攻擊該處貪汚之標貼，隨即有沈珪璋黃汝珍等吿密，局方立即追踪査究，破案送院。</p>
<p>（三）郁査嚴咬稱向本人行賄五百萬元，及三次約彼會議，全屬虛構，不値一笑。本人做事數十年，社曾自有定評。</p>

<h3>請全市市民看一看　監督寺廟條例</h3>
<p>— 張曉崧</p>
<p>本市自治機構，自上年底建立以來，因辦公房屋無着，大多均係向其他機關暫時借用，侷促一隅，影響自治工作之推行，實匪淺鮮。借住房屋，自難久居，遷移又無房子，租屋又無條子，際此戰後，人民元氣未復之時，何能奢望每個自治機構，皆能募捐建築，故各區公所自成立迄今，幾無日不在鬧房屋問題，本人亦無日不爲此而煞費腦筋。然吾人不能因辦公房屋無着而停廢自治工作，故參議員諸公，有鑒於斯，提議撥用或借用寺廟爲自治機構辦公房屋，當時反對者固有，贊成者多數。本人以事關目前推行自治工作之急要問題，要求發言，說明此提案，於情於法，並無不合之處。</p>
<p>査監督寺廟條例第四條「荒廢之寺廟，由地方自治團體管理之」之規定，則本市如有合於本條規定之寺廟，自可依法撥用。又第十條規定，「寺廟應按其財產情形，興辦公益或慈善事業，」又第十一條規定「遠反第十條之規定，（即寺廟不興辦公益或慈善事業者，）得革除其住持。」則本議案所稱商借或撥用寺廟作爲自治機構房屋，與此旨甚爲符合。茲將國民政府公佈監督寺廟條例刋諸報端，請全市市民看一看，便可明白。</p>
<p>（第一條）凡有僧道住持之宗敎上建築物，不論用何名稱，均爲寺廟。（第二條）寺廟及其財產法物，除法律別有規定外，依本條例監督之。前項法物，謂於宗敎上歷史上美術上，有關係之佛像神像禮器樂器法器經典雕刻繪畫，及其他向由寺廟保存之一切古物。（第三條）寺廟屬於左列各款之一者，不適用於本條例之規定。一·由政府機關管理者。二·由地方公共團體管理者。三·由私人建立並管理者。</p>
<p>（第四條）荒廢之寺廟，由地方自治團體管理之。（第五條）寺廟財產及法物，應向該管地方官署呈請登記。（第六條）寺廟財產及法物，爲寺廟所有，由住持管理之。寺廟有管理權之僧道，不論用何名稱認爲住持，但非中華民國人民不得爲住持。（第七條）住持於宣揚敎義，修持戒律，及其他正當開支外，不得動用寺廟財產之收入。（第八條）寺廟不動產及法物，非經所屬佛敎會之決議，並呈請該管官署許可，不得處分或變更。（第九條）寺廟收支款項，及所興辦事業，住持應於每半年終，報吿該管官署，並公吿之。</p>
<p>（第十條）寺廟應按其財產情形興辦公益，或慈善事業，（第十一條）違反本條例第五條，第六條，或第十條之規定者，該管官署得革除其住持之職。違反第七條或第八條之規定者，得逐出寺廟，或送法院究辦。（第十二條），本條例於西藏·西康·蒙古·靑海·之寺廟，不適用之。（第十三條）本條例自公布日施行。</p>

<h3>紡建掛牌取消　隨聯合配售辦理　紗布大漲市面頗呈紊亂本銷客銷同時異常活躍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第六區機器紡織業同業公會於昨日下午二時，召集會議。出席會員二十九單位，即度決議二次集團配紗時，取消以雙馬牌爲開紗之標準，而改以四百磅二十支棉紗爲標準。同時並商討各會員對配紗之分擔辦法。至開紗各項手續，觀前並無多大變更。</p>
<p>又中國紡建公司自決定　將原有每週一三五上午掛牌配售制取消後，已歸併聯合配合銷委員會統一辦理，以資劃一。故今後紡建開紗情形，亦將延遲至每週一三五下午四五時，方知端倪。聞昨日下行，紡公司會爲改變配售制，而召開會議。商討歷時頗久。</p>
<p>昨日紗市漲勞益狂，因各地交易暢達客　收羅現貨奇殷，紗價本已極爲熱身挺秀，加以紡建上日夜間發表期貨配售價格，提高六萬至十九萬，〔內三十二支藍鳳增六萬，二十支及四十二支漲十八九萬〕，是以激動人心，勢如火上加油，漲勞乃有青雲直上之概，普遍約升一成左右，據聞昨市除北路走銷仍湧，客銷暢達外，本市織廠，亦紛紛採購原料，以抵補其拋售之坯布缺額，已呈求供不均之局，且前日紡開紗，忽變方針，已決定隨商廠聯合售紗，一致加價，其昨日所開市價，且暴漲一萬，遂致市價躍升，人心惶亂，綜　價格二十支標準紗，漲起址餘萬元，爲一百七十萬元左右，四十二支二百四十餘萬元，市場人氣尚在看漲。</p>
<p>昨棉布貨價狂跳，人心惶亂，蓋數日來客幫之走化甚股，華南禁運可以開放，市勢早成堅挺之局，乃客銷經連日動辦以後，納胃漸襄，本可暫時定局，昨市之飛揚，實出於紡建開價之變理，陽鶴細布六萬三千元，較上期所開同等之五　細布，激漲一萬元，人心因以刺激，同時各坯布廠家，因前開期貨未清，不敢多放，而染廠及本街，則搜　加殷，供求既失平衡，市情遂益混亂，本日做開三A彩球細布七萬二千元，老貨四君子嗶嘰七萬六千五百元。</p>
<h3>配紗應改善三點　紗布核准南運務期公允</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗布之供應情形及其市而情形，均有劇烈之變動，有關係方面，鹹深切注意，據棉織複製品工業界負責人潘士浩氏談稱，此種變動，本在意料之中，不必驚奇，並稱關於供應辦法，正在商請當局改善之中，市面應可漸趨穩定雲，據氏表示，民營紗廠在紡建支配下之聯合開貨，原爲正當措置，惟有須改進者三點：〔一〕開售期貨，而貨款須全部收足。在此工貸無著，銀根緊急之日，尚須兼籌並顧，酌量變通，〔二〕請購單收齊後，始開價，與交易慣例不符，據其辦法，請購而退者撤消其以後之資格，則價格不合之時當如何辦理，且收單在白天，而開價在晚上，亦多不便，〔三〕期貨棧單必須限期出清，否則徒足以釀成皮球買賣，又稱紡建派貨在外匯變率後之一個月來，表面上雖似維持原價，而其間改牌加碼，早已在醞釀漲價，且以一般市價而論，其減價之低，確已使其犧牲盈利不少，今對於民營紗廠之聯售，既已取得控制，則將棉紗平配取銷，而跟商廠之盤，原屬無可厚非，惟供應辦法亦蹈覆轍，未免可惜，且以目前紡建之售價而言，陽鶴細布掛價六萬三千元，較一月前漲一萬元，較戰前則漲上八千倍以上，爲安定物價計，必須急謀有效之辦法，心避免再有刺激，棉織複製品工業以原料不足，向黑市搜購，亦非善策，應妥籌備善後，至於華南紗布禁運問題，據潘氏表示，解禁勢在必行，惟在申請核准之制度下，應注意民營生產機構之保全，紡建在目前，對於紗布市場，已取得控制權，自屬可喜之事，惟操有核運機之紡委會今後對於南運紗布之核准，應放大眼光，出以公允之措置雲。</p>
<h3>新鈔票</h3>
<p>一千一百八十箱昨由利物浦運來</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕太古藍煙囱經理之格林斯辿爾號，恩由悌爾號，及本行輪賽姆傑克號三輪由利物浦運來大批法幣同，共計一千一百八十箱，業已分別提取。</p>
<h3>外匯謠言　當局將澈查起因</h3>
<p>連日此間忽又謠傳外匯率將行調整之說，毫無事實根據，當局對此甚爲憤慨，宋院長今日　因政躬尚未大痊，在祁齊路寓邨休憩，惟曾接見銀行家多人，對此種謠言，亦有查詢，聞將飭屬澈查此項謠言起因雲。</p>
<h3>公債疲落</h3>
<p>公債仍有零星斬多，在三百餘萬成交下稍告疲落，統丙晨開二〇〇〇元，最高微升至二〇五〇元，而復告　低，價退至一八四〇元，臨收稍定，結果較前收跌落一一〇元，甲乙各小五〇元，丁戊微失挫二〇元。</p>
<h3>外股缺少變化</h3>
<p>外股大股見疲，小股有西人搜羅，微告見秀，大股開後略告下挫，均乏大變，結果較前收計英聯怡紗會德豐怡啤稍挫，鋼業航業紙業微升，業廣則平。</p>
<h3>結欵多，紗價漲金鈔繼續上升</h3>
<p>烚赤昨仍受美鈔所鼓勵，初平繼俏，陷央行於苦戰局面，晨開即微挫爲二一六萬八，央行有所管制，開後即告疲軟，曾回小至二一五萬內，無何美鈔機後步緊，又起買氣，漸漸回漲，十時後央行配給一八三條，價亦隨市提升至二一七萬二五，入後曾升至二一七萬八，始遭壓迫，逐漸固降，近午曾微挫至二一六萬，午刻在二一六萬五左右掙扎，午後散戶聞紡建提高紗價，又起騷動，曾漲到二二〇萬外</p>
<p>，而後稍回，綶再升一萬三，飾金紋銀未動，銀元賣價略增，暗拆銀根仍髩，息價仍祇一角三左右。</p>
<p>外幣亦再追隨美鈔，同趨信利，美鈔晨開尚因金價被管制，稍有斬多，三六八〇元有供，開後不久曾跌至三六〇〇元以下，方告維持，結款再來收購，立被帶高，散戶紛來追進，買風又起，漲到三七五〇元始有　　，午前曾降落至三六五〇元，午刻仍站定於三七〇〇元以上，午後因逢週六，爭買更盛，盤高至三八七〇元而後稍圓，結果較前收續升七十元，對黃金之比價稍形軋據至五七八元左右對十兩，港票隨之而高，亦漲二十元，港匯自七四〇元賣價起，提升至七五〇元有求無供，印匯自八七〇元升至九百元外，英匯一二〇〇〇元左右，美匯牌價未更已無對做。</p>
<h3>多頭逢高供售華股不易抬頭</h3>
<p>華股晨開依然循前數日老途，上場見榮，惜僅半小時，一般多頭陸續逢高供售，抬面幫無法支持，十時半後復趨下遊，物資漲風大起，遊資傾向囤積之途，於是脫股求貨者，陸續活動，市價在逐節微挫下，每況愈下，疲莫能興，僅中絲有一九〇號及一五一號，互相爭買下反見轉倘，其他各股都無辦法，近午後起斬多，臨收時有銀行幫來進，美來略告平定，結果較之前收計永紗景福平平，美亞新光勤興微降，冷門中僅麗安跌半成，餘者都告微降，成交總額四·七四四·〇〇〇股，內計永紗一·五六〇·〇〇〇股，景福九七八·〇〇〇股，新光九一七·〇〇〇股，美亞二一八·〇〇〇股，其他各股大致自數萬股至十二十萬股不等，場外各股疲多於平。</p>
<h3>國際貿易新希望　物價穩定·運輸改善</h3>
<p>〔合眾社紐約二十日電〕美國商界對於中國方面爲拉平進出口之極大差額所作之努力，刻正密切予以注意。在過去幾個月中，中國之輸出僅及輸入百分之二十，而外匯之存額又日薄，因此中美貿易前途殊爲黯淡，然最近有兩事令人發生新希望，其一爲中國政府取消出口稅，其二爲中國通貨在過去一個月中貶價幾達百分之五十上。此外美國商人尚發現其他兩種有利之微象。即最近中國市場上之物價相當穩定，與中國運輸系統之日見改進是也。</p>
<h3>到貨雖多米價仍俏　粉麥銷暢行市步升</h3>
<p>米市昨以天雨產區高昂，早市哄升二千元，收盤帶呆，結果杜羊秞軋升千元，客秞埠秞平平，白元亦少上落，粳米甚堅，客貨登記南北市共一萬一千餘石，麵粉銷路異常活玲，求過於供猛漲七八百元，小麥閩幫進胃甚濃，盤升六七百元，麥皮步步高翔，續漲二三百元，黃豆高貨見昂千元，中下平正，生仁南洋進取，本街零化亦殷，繼續步漲三五千元，　豆高倘次削，油市升降互有，青島生油來源甚多，下挫千元，豆油貨少，挺秀千元，菜油亦趨穩站，豆餅帶挺。</p>
<h3>多頭逢高供售　華股不易抬頭</h3>
<p>華股晨開依然循前數日老途，上場見榮，惜僅半小時，一般多頭陸續逢高供售，抬面幫無法支持，十時半後復趨下游，物資漲風大起，游資傾向囤積之途，於是脫股求貨者，陸續活動，市價在逐節微挫下，每況愈下，疲莫能興，僅中絲有一九〇號及一五一號，互相爭買下，反見轉倘，其他各股都無辦法，近午復起斬多，二三三號售出美亞甚多，臨收時有急用地幫來進，美亞略告平定，結果較前收計永紗景福平平，美亞新光勤興微降，冷門中僅絲業再好半成，馀者都告微降，鶴立雞群，中紡五和平平，統益大通俗人亞麗安跌半成，馀者都告微降，成交總額四·七四四·〇〇〇股，內計永紗一·五六〇·〇〇〇股，景福九七八·〇〇〇股，新光九一七·〇〇〇股，美亞二一八·〇〇〇股，其他各股大致自數萬股至十二萬股不等，場外各股疲多於平。</p>
<h3>陳抽珍　菲洲有需要　定單已簽妥</h3>
<p>印荘對於陳抽珍，陳特貢等花色，續有需要，市況見俏，本市某茶葉公司，近日又接菲洲來電，需求陳抽珍，囑源源裝運彼地，但貨方以無利可圖，態度頗爲猶豫，嗣爲殷開外銷起見，轉趨遷就，聞目前雙方定單業已簽妥，大致在下月份即擬交貨，至於紅綠茶內銷，本街店荘及蘇錫等地，依然甚暢，溫州粗毛紅，尤有隨見隨銷之勢，結果每擔溢出六萬元外，馀則亦帶鋒銳。</p>
<h3>敵偽商標處理辦法　商標局擬具三大要點</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：經濟部商標局爲整飭收復區敵偽商標處理手續起見，業已擬具處人法三點，呈奉經濟部核準在案，茲探該項辦法如次：</p>
<p>（一）凡在收復區內由敵偽組織審定註冊之商標，無論屬何國籍，一概無效，（二）敵僞組織所發商標註冊證審定書或爭議案之審定書評需及有關公報文件，均不得作爲依據商標法主張使用或其他　利之證明，（三）中外商民執有由中央政府商標註冊機關發給之註冊證或審定書，而經敵偽組織查騐加蓋戳記成加注其他字樣，或經　發文件者，應即呈繳經濟部商標局查核，一律予以換發。</p>
<h3>經濟分區制度　滬列爲第四區</h3>

<h3>日本拒絕輸出剩馀鮮繭　我方再度提出交涉　統帥部調查統計不確實</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近日合眾社東京來電，又傳駐日本盟軍統帥部，有拒絕對我輸出剩馀鮮　之訊。記者特詢諸中國蠶絲公司某負責人，據告：我國以日本鮮　剩馀頗多，而我國則頗匱乏，故曾於本年四月間，首次提出以易貨辦法，向日交換此批　　，未得結果。茲於三週前，又曾提出同樣要求，現仍在口頭交涉中。據告：美方所以遲延不拔之原因有三：（一）認爲我國現尚有存　八萬擔，已足敷本年下半度之用。（二）上海工銀昂貴同，且時有罷工風潮，即使拔給剩　，恐不能盡量生產生絲。且即有生產，恐品質不佳。（三）上海燃料問題嚴重，煤斤柴油均缺。茲據該負責人表示：美方所持原因，俱係關查不確所致。蓋估計本年我國江浙兩省所收秋　，不過二萬擔。而江浙兩省所有絲廠，共有絲車一萬〇五百部。如欲維持開車至明春俗人　上市時止，至少尚須　一千萬磅，合七萬五千擔。否則，全體絲廠，將告停工。至　工潮，最近已見緩和，決不影響生絲生產。且我國生絲質料，均極高超，商品檢騐局檢騐出口之生絲，百分之九十五，均合出口之標準。燃料實亦並不缺乏，且絲業生產，現均同政府特准配售煤斤柴油等燃料。渠又稱：我國在戰時期間，江浙各省之　桑設備，被日本寇摧毀遣。茲者尚未言及賠償，而係以日本急需之我國物資，向日交換　馀之鮮　，故此項請求，自屬合理。故現已同朱世明將軍再度向盟軍總帥部交涉易取　　。渠稱：　　美方有確實之調查，以免爲歪曲之情報所誤事。渠並深信：在各項原因調查屬實後，日本　之運來我國，當無問題雲。</p>
<h3>匯款收條印花稅　應照印花稅率第十五目貼用</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市商會於本年七月八日曾呈請財政部，略謂查受領匯款人出具之匯款收條，戰前曾由阮會呈奉鈞部解釋，以該項收條，係領款人所出，與銀行錢荘及各業商店所出憑以支取銀錢之支票匯票本票性質不同，應照銀錢收據之稅率貼花，不應比照支取或匯兌之銀錢單據貼花，當同鈞部通行全國有案，此項解釋，未　目前有無變更，應請查明示遵導語，茲商會已奉財政部批示稱，查受領匯款人出具之匯款收條，應改依修正鉺花稅法稅率第十五目支取，或匯兌銀錢之單據簿摺例，貼用印花稅票（單據每件貼印花二十元簿摺每件貼印花一百元）商會當通函各公會商店晒照辦理雲。</p>
<h3>麵粉工業危殆籲請抑平麥價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第四區麵粉工業同業公會　昨日召開理監事聯席會議，共商挽救當前麵粉工業危機。各理監事咸以目前麵粉生產成本過高，小廠雖紛紛倒閉，大廠亦在陸續停車中。現即麵粉出口弛禁，因麵粉限價關係，仍無補於廠商。設麥價不平，本市麵粉生產，惟有日趨萎縮之途。預計本年底，麵粉工廠將有一半倒閉。故月前切要之圖，決籥請政府先抑平麥價。</p>
<h3>白煤塊又猛升</h3>
<p>煤市白煤節塊，行情雖高，然因到貨無望，供者微細，求者心切，市價繼續高翔，陽泉篩塊每噸六十五萬元，尚缺賣戶，熟煤及焦炭亦因白煤塊價格上升，而隨之昂鷹，清水貨中與焦每噸高達六十萬元，普通井陘焦亦需三十三四萬元雲。</p>
<h3>鹽商請緩施行商運商銷辦法</h3>
<p>抗戰期中，政府管制食鹽官運商銷，茲以戰事結束，　須施行管制之必要，前由財部通令各地鹽商，定於三十六年元月份起，變更上項辦法，仍恢復同運商銷，惟一般鹽商，在管制期內，虧折頗大，元氣尚未恢復，若由商運商銷，資金週轉不免困難，已聯合呈請鹽務當局，延期二年實施雲。</p>
<h3>木材市況轉堅</h3>
<p>昨木材市況，杉木雖有到貨，惟因大中華船運來之杉木，遲遲起卸，且賣方因鑑成本增加，多不願廉售，惟市上需求亦　，價故轉堅。</p>
<h3>柏油日趨鬆跌</h3>
<p>柏油節前青雲直上，鋒芒無比，節後氣勢稍　，先因天時炎熱，裝運不便，來源稀少，最近各處到貨廣集，市面即受頓挫，至於各產地存積，浙東久已單薄，縱秋涼有到，亦已無多，惟金蘭杭州等行家不能多數容納，有到即銷，以申地爲尾　，故本市時見陸續有到也，而漢口方面自本埠行家辦存之貨絡繹運申後：乃販運者亦有運來，形勢漸趨和平，行家售盤業已調整，計禾本油十四萬二千元，內坪油十三萬四千元，龍尖十三萬元，的干油十二萬六千元，尖麻城油十一萬六千元，普通麻城油十一萬元。</p>

<h3>減低當息之唯一途徑</h3>
<p>— 曹永安　旭豐當</p>
<p>在獲得銀行之低利放款</p>
<p>吾當業由來已久，爲唯一之平民金融機關。故雖平蠅頭而官應不以爲迕，明知取利於民，而貧民仍樂就之，今典當營業清淡，實由利息太高，貧民無力負擔所致，告貸無門，綏急無可周轉，非社會之福也。外界不明此中情形，徒責當業以減息，但拆息太高，開支過大，各股東又何必操此蝕本生意。故欲周濟平民，必須維持典當，而欲維持典當，須使當業能獲得低利之資金，鄙意應由國家銀行或市銀行，減輕利息，放於當業，然後責當業公會減氏當息，限令實行，其各典當之組織，財力，營　實況，公會應負審查報告之責，銀行低利放款，公會負責監督，如此則款不虛放，當可支持，而貧民亦可享其實惠矣，愚從事此業，爲時尚暫，然既知內無低利之資金，即對外永無減息之可能，平民與當業，惟有交受其病而已，妥不揣人微言輕，率陳愚見，尚希高明賜教。</p>

<p>本報十九日香港航訊</p>
<p>經過八年抗戰和二次世界大戰，中華民族在世界上的地位已獲得新的估量。我們的和平政策，在國際玷　上放射着特別的光芒。我們沒有對人逞强，更談不到侵略，反之，別人過去有什麽對不起我們的地方，我們還是本守傳統的和平精神，尋求與對方成立諒解。我們很明瞭他人的苦衷。我們也知道過去多年來的積習，不要說佔盡便宜的對方一時無法更新轉變，就是我們很多「軟骨頭」，一時也不易挺起脊樑來。祇要對方能够認識了這個於情於理無可推諉的新轉變，以平等互惠的態度對待我們，我們絕無故意翻舊賬，與人爲難。這個事實，在香港問題方面，表現得更爲明顯。</p>
<p>今大世界上有識之士，誰都承認香港問題是中英邦交百年來汚點的結晶。開明的英國人民，爲了保證對中國的戰後新友誼，早已主張把香港交還中國。但英國對外政策的轉變，却跟不上國際形勢的轉變，香港問題便無形中成了中英邦交的一個重點。中國方面新的呼吸（Aspiration）和英國方面舊的傾向（Inclinationg），便以香港爲煤介而發生正面的接觸。自英軍重入香港這一年來，中英兩股勢力由於種種無法避免的因素而衝擊起來，小的不計，大的已有數起，記者前曾摘要報道。記者願趁此機會說明一句；記者站在報道的立塲上，對自己的祖國幷無偏愛，對盟友的英國亦無惡感。近日來，所以不殫煩的作有關香港問題，尤其中英雙方引起不愉快事件的報吿，一方面爲適應注視香港問題的國內讀者要求，另一方面亦所以就正於關懷中英邦交的國際人士。記者每次執筆，都深深地祈望香港這個小島將會變成中英兩大民族新友誼的基石，而不是中英兩大民族新力量的角逐塲。這個轉捩，有賴於中國方面努力的當屬不少，而有賴於英國方面努力的似爲更大。在香港新環境下最近產生的</p>
<p>中英不愉快事件</p>
<p>又有兩起：九龍設中國法庭的談判與九龍城設治的交涉。前者於七月廿九日揭露出來，後者則發生於九月初，到了港府十四日發表聲明，才吿了一個段落。當九龍設法庭的談判消息傳出時，記者因爲我官方尙未到正式發表的時期，爲了中英盟誼，當日且按下不表。不料一波未平，九龍城設治問題又一波繼起。這兩個問題都是有關中英條約和主權的，且爲多年未決的懸案，事情發展到了現在，記者考量再三，實有報道的必要。</p>
<p>九龍城問題早在戰前甘介侯祖任兩粵外交特派員的時候，已喧騰國內，中英雙方往返折　，久無結果，及至抗戰軍興，才無形停頓下來。根據一八九八年六月九日簽訂的中英展拓香港界址專條。九龍城雖夾在新界租借地中，牠的主權仍舊屬於中國的。該條約內明文規定：「所有現在九龍城內駐紥之中國官員，仍可在城內各司其事，惟不得與保衛香港之武備有所妨礙。」又議定：「仍留附近九龍城原舊碼頭一區，以便中國兵商各船渡艇任便往來停泊，几便官民任便行走。」九龍城原有居民，藉上述的規定，安居下來，不受英國法律所的束，不納港府的租稅，如是者計有二三十年。至民二十年後，英人便放出拆卸城牆開闢馬路的空氣，着令原有民居（的有百戶）遷出。居民選派代表赴廣州求援，九龍城問題遂從此起。九龍城歸實安縣屬，（淸代稱新安縣，九龍城即新安縣九龍司的寨城）雖有條約規定，仍爲我國主權所及的領土，但是彈丸小地，早已爲國人所遺忘。原有通海碼頭（名龍津渡頭）因英人塡海工程巳遭塡平。四而受租借地所包圍。城垣依山建築，（見圓）城內平地甚少，祇有官衙兩座，民巷一條，充其量亦不過像一個小村落。當日要是港府遵守條約，仍讓居民安處城中，我當局斷無小題大做，惹是生非之理。九龍城地偏山麓，無礙交通，英人在相安無事之中，何故突如其來，要拆卸城牆，開築馬路，已屬費解，後來强迫居民遷離，寗願另擇地點爲居民建築「新村」，與居民交換原有城中物業，尤其叵心莫測。當日有一部分居民中了「利誘威脅」之計，放棄原有城內住所，徙居英人代建的「新村」，但少數深明大義的，不忍與世世相傳的祖居分離，仍舊卷戀不去。兩粵外交特派員奉命一再與港府交涉，英人雖拆卸了一部分已遷離者的房屋，但始終未敢悍然拆城。這個英人遲遲</p>
<p>不敢動手拆的城</p>
<p>到了日人侵入香港，他們爲了開拓城外的啓德機塲，便把古老的小城拆得一乾二凈。九龍城遭受英日方面兩次的破壞，面目全非。由昔日衙署改爲老人院的一座房子，戰前獲得基督敎徒的重修，現已成爲城中碩果僅存完整的建築物。其旁另一間義學，現已簷破牆穿，搖搖欲倒。其他各處，都已蔓草叢生，不辨道路。戰後寳安縣當局爲確保南疆主權，根據條約，呈報粵省府和兩廣外交特派員公署，復由粵省府轉呈內政部和外交部，親劃在九龍城設法，函電往還，前後多月，最近縣當局接獲上峯覆准，特派縣府民政科科長來港和兩廣外交特派員商洽，這個消息甫經港中各報發表，九龍城問題又從一般人的記憶裏發掘出來。但這回巳由制止拆城而變爲設洽，剛巧又在報上刋出我政府進行與英方談判在九龍設立中國法庭的消息後不久。橋胞對着已失去了的主　，不由得引起了深切的憧憬。九月十四日的新生晚報，特出了一個九龍城設治的專刋，從歷史方面對這個問題作一個有系統的探討。</p>
<p>當這個事件已在僑胞之間激起不平常的反應，我駐港外交方面因爲「外交立塲」還未作正式表示時，港府發言人却在新生晚報特刋出版後三小時內，對九龍城治權問題發表正式聲明。同一條約，我們解釋爲九龍城的主權仍歸我國所有的，港府却認爲「事實上，該條約之詞句語氣，亦與不包括九龍城在內之意向不相吻合」，故「於租借期內，九龍城已變爲英國之擴展領土之一部，及隸屬英國之主權。」又進一步解釋說。「一八九九年中國官吏在九龍城內行使法權，已與保衛香港之軍事需要不相吻合，因而該項法權之行使，即吿中止」云云。</p>
<p>港府聲明發表後，是是非非，覆按條約原文，自有公論。翌日，工商晚報的許論，便以「九龍城間題」爲題，「將條約原文就正」於港府，認爲「港府發言人所談，似不無有點牽強」，蓋「九龍城問題，祇有一八九八年的條約，其後並無其他之更張」，港府聲明所言，「未悉有何其他之根據？」該報便作語重心長的結論稱：「在中英友誼如此密切中，一般發言人之談話，我們以爲有審愼之必要，不然，誤會陷於誤會之中，便不易解了。」</p>
<p>十五日，新生晚報以「港府關於九龍城的聲明」爲題著論稱；「當時條約上，雖無明文規定九龍城範圍內的土地權，係在九龍租借地範圍之外，但城內法治權　　白規定由中國方面保留……我們願意尋求事理的正確……對於港府的聲明……並不以此爲滿足。這一個關於九龍租借條約的問題，關係香港本身，也關係中英盟國，我們希望並且期待我外交當局的一言，以釋羣疑，而正視聽」。</p>

<h3>關於寺廟問題</h3>
<p>上海市參議會通過「撥用寺廟」致上海市僧衆請願覆議撤銷事，太虛近養病中，且上海事件可由佛敎分會請求市參議會市政府賢明諸公了之，故未預問。讀二十一日貴報「寺廟僧衆何必誤會」社論，論末涉及太虛，謬蒙以賢達相許，愧感之餘，不得不扶病略陳鄙見，請賜刋布。</p>
<p>（一）原論以「民國以來借用佛殿辦學，到處皆然」。此沿淸季疵政，演成敝習。民國二十年以至最近中央，疊申禁令，尙難戢止「惡風」，何可再事但導？（二）監督寺廟條例爲立法院民十八所立，關于內地佛道二教寺廟，法例明定「寺廟財產屬於寺廟」，—（私財團法人），由住持管理—（法定代理人），—非經所屬敎會（若佛敎寺廟所屬佛敎會）議決，呈請內政部批准，不得變動。則寺廟財產屬於「私財團法人或私社團法人之私產明甚。公，但公於其財團社團以內，其佛敎等寺廟與天主敎堂基督敎堂回敎淸眞寺一般。（三）監督寺廟條例，對佛敎等寺廟，須辦慈善公益，乃勸導佛寺僧衆等自動興辦者。太虛由中國佛敎會屢經勸吿各省市縣敎會及寺僧，自動興辦者已屬不少。內政部前依之訂立寺廟興辦慈善公益實施辦法，敎育部於縣鄉辦小學亦涉及勸用祠堂寺廟一條，某省或某縣據之有訂單行法或非法佔佛寺奪僧產者。最近中國佛敎會整理委員會以其流弊，陳商及呈請社會部內政部轉呈行政院，業已批令撤銷寺廟興辦慈善公益辦法，及敎育部關於縣鄕小學勸用佛寺一條，并某省某縣關於「侵害寺廟權利」等單行辦法。批經二月，想各省市縣政府應已得悉院批也。（四）地方自治機構缺辦公房屋時，撥用地方公共建築或利用公地興築，或租借民房，其途甚多。佛敎等宗敎寺廟自屬同于天主教堂等一般，是「私財團法人或私社團法人」之私產，撥用佛敎寺廟，非撥用人民私產而何？（五）雖解釋爲「撥用指孔廟岳廟等先賢廟或城隍廟等地方神廟，或監督寺廟條例所謂無主廢廟而言，此自當別論」，而對於宗敎之若佛寺等，則可向借用。幷指佛寺等或集衆人之資興建，當屬地方公產，亦屬不然，至商請租借，則應與租借一般人民私產相同，何須特將寺廟提出爲借用對象，以爲可以强迫借用之餘地？今欲息全市僧衆驚憤惶怖，惟有仗參議會市政府賢明當局，迅作如下之處置：（一）市參議會複議此「撥用或借用寺廟」一條，修正爲「撥用邑廟或無主廢廟等」，而商請租借，則由欲租借人自去商請房主同意。（二）市府速令强佔寺廟者遷出，以免全市各僧寺之慄慄疑懼。貴報執輿論界牛耳，億人瞻仰，願有以善導全市寺僧安定，俾得以發揚大慈大悲佛旨，服務社會，輔助民治，惟貴報敎正之。太虛謹啓九月廿一日</p>
<h3>星期論壇　反對原子戰爭的人們</h3>
<p>— 袁大中</p>
<p>知道原子戰爭利害的人們，未有不反對原子戰爭者；但是所以反對的心理及其作用，却不一律。如其加以分析，可分爲左列三種：</p>
<p>第一種人，自已未曾備有原子彈，根木亦不希望操有原子彈，當然更不希望別人操有原子彈。他們不僅反對原子戰爭，而且反對一切戰爭，所以他們不但並未具有原子戰爭的企圖及準備，亦少具有各種武器以供戰爭之用。他們可以說是眞正的愛好和平者；但是他們有多少力量可以供給維持和平之用？實在是很少很少！一旦遇到「野蠻人」的侵略，他們果將如何抵禦強暴以保全自己國族的生命，維特世界人類的和平？他們自已毫無把握，同時，野蠻的侵略者的野心，亦因此而加强，而把這羣愛好和平者作爲甘肥的竄獲物。</p>
<p>第二種人，自己已經備有原子彈，可是他們幷不贊成侵略主義，所以雖然備有這特凶武器，並不希望使用；雖不希望使用，可又不能不加準備，以免其被別人使用。他們與第一種人同樣的愛好和平，可是他們又具有維持和平的力量；他們不但不許自己侵略，亦幷不許別人侵略。因此，他們常是侵略者的冤家對頭，把它看作眼中釘，肉中刺。</p>
<p>第三種人，希望自己把有原子彈，同時又怕別人把有原子彈，更忌別人先他而把有原子彈，所以他們拚命的獎勵國內研究原子彈，製造原子彈，把原子彈看作第一生命，至於廢寢忘食，寗可犧牲一切以爭取這最凶的武器，甚至不惜用偸，用搶，用騙，用盡所有技倆，以期奪取別人手巾的原子彈。可是，同時他們在還沒有確切把有原子彈以前，也在那裏反對原子彈，反對原子彈戰爭。他們在自己未曾把有原子彈的時期，當然是反對原子戰爭的急先鋒；一旦他們得到原子彈之後，是否依然反對原子戰爭，却難說了。他們只是主張原子彈應該公開共有，這與取消原子彈火有區別；他們並不主張將一切秘密武器，一律公開共有，尤其他們所單獨保有的部分。他們也不主張取消亞於原子彈的一切凶器，或是禁止使用這些凶器。所以他們究竟是爲維持世界人類和平而來反對原子戰爭，還是在未來戰爭中爲把有自國的絕對勝利而來反對原子戰爭，不能使人無所疑慮。至少，他們的反戰主張，未必是澈底的。他們是否就是侵略者？我們也不必批評或辯護，自會有事實陳列在那裏，天下後世亦自有公論。</p>
<p>反對戰爭，當然包括一切戰爭在內，而不只是反對原子戰爭。如其僅僅反對原子戰爭，而不禁止其他凶器，此項舉動，不知有何意義？孟子所設，殺人以挺與刃有異乎？就是此理。納粹日義三凶，並未獲有原子彈，可是整個世界業經被他們擾亂得陵谷變遷，河枯海沸，即此可以證明第三種人之反對原子戰爭而不反對一切戰爭，是別有用心的。</p>
<p>反對戰爭，是反對無端挑戰，而不是反對被挑戰者的正常防衛。現在最可恨者，就是不分靑紅皂白，而把挑戰與應戰混在一起，不能够正本淸源的把它辨別淸楚。人間旣無公是公非，侵略者乃得公然顚倒黑白，欲以一手掩盡天下目。像軸心國往日一樣，明明是侵略鄰國的疆土，刦掠鄰邦的財產，而還要諱言之曰自衛，如此欺人太甚，亦因爲被欺者太爲糊塗，纔給與野心家以欺騙的機會。</p>
<p>現在第二種人之中，居然有人慷慨地捉議把原子彈拿出來公開共有，或是消滅不用，這宗理論不能說是不偉大，不高尙。可是在這個時期，發這種大而無當的高論，却又不免於迂闊，冒昧，甚至糊塗。我們並不反對原子彈的公開共有，但是有一個前提，凡參加此項公開共有的人們，必須先具有保證其人決不單獨濫用此項武器。如其不問心術，不辨利害，濫於公開共有，誰敢保此項利器又不被野心家乘隙濫用？我們不要以爲一經公開共有之後，大家都操有利器，自然互相牽掣，莫敢先發！試問近百年來，列强之中，何嘗不保有相當的均勢，凡屬強國，又何嘗不都保有相當的武器，相等的力量？可是，戰禍終於不免！即此可以證明公開共有，並不即足以互相牽掣顧忌，而减少侵略者的野心。所以然者，主要武器縱能保其均勢，而其他輔助作用，總不免於各有優劣巧拙，縱令乘除相抵，勢均力敵，然而時機的作用尤爲重要。所以侵略者每每力爭主動與先著，觀於軸心法西斯國家而可知。這在其他武器，還可藉空間以抵抗時間，距離遠者猶可占取守勢，徐圖轉園。例如珍珠港之陰謀，還仗着患洋遠隔，日本只可藉一度之詐欺，搶取初步勝利，而未能於此取得決定性之最後勝利。今後可不同了，如其持有原子彈者，亦仿照珍珠港的陰謀，來一度迅雷不及掩耳的奇襲，這時候被襲者縱有超特武器與大量軍備，恐怕不等你動手抵抗，甚至於未及察覺感觸之中，業已一命嗚呼了！</p>
<p>世界戰禍三大罪魁，固然已經伏罪而自斃，然而我們不要以爲繼起無人。人類俱抱有優越感，尤其是由野蠻乍入文明的初生之犢，更有不可一世的觀念。今後縱令所有民族人類，文明進步，大致平等，優越感或者能够减少若干，但是各國各族的立塲旣難强同，貧富强弱也終久不能一律。貧弱對於富强旣不勝其羨慕與嫉妬，而富强對於貧弱則表示同情者甚少，甚或因此自驕；尤其强而不富對於富而不強的國家，更如無賴土匪之垂涎於富商巨賈，終思一刦之而後快心。</p>
<p>有人說，少數强國之所以互相猜疑而不能忠實合作，是因爲原子彈之米能公開共有；因此使「無」的國家對於「有」的國家，不能無所顧慮。這在人情物理上說，常然具有片面理由。但是事實上並不如此。現在未操有原子彈之國家占全體二十分之十九，其中大多數都屬於本文所指的第一種人，他們的主權生命，迄今仍在毫無保障之中，然而他們並不爭執原子彈的有無，他們對於操有原子彈的國家，也很少猜嫌疑忌，甚至還有願意托庇宇下，藉著他們的威力，以維持一時之和平。同時，他們亦有若千正在那裏戰戰競競抱有朝不保暮之感，然而他們所引爲可憂可懼者，倒並不在於保有原子彈的人們，而正是那未曾把有原子彈而竭力要求把有原子彈的人們。</p>
<p>原子彈的威力，的確可怕，只放了兩顆原子彈，就改變了日本最後抵抗的野心而驟然投降。這對於侵略而好戰的國家，的確是一大威脅；然而如果把有原子彈的人們，確能天下爲公們固難逆料，但是截至現在爲止，持有這特輯武器的國家，並未曾濫用他們所特有的武器而去侵略別國，他們更沒有這個企圖，他們的政體，亦不容許他們抱有這個企圖。所以我覺得上節所說，因「無」對「有」而致發生猜嫌，妨害國際合作，這不過是一種托詞，藉作掩飾他們侵略的烟幕。一年以來，是第二種人在那裏侵略，還是第三種人在那裏侵略，自有事實爲之說明，也不待本文再加論列。他們還未操有最凶兵器，業已如此猖狂，一旦操之在手，又當如何？操有此利器的少數國家，因爲政體特殊而不許少數當局予以濫用，這正是民主國家的最大優點。然而對於抵抗侵略出發制人，那民全國家的優點却又變爲弱點。第三種人看破了這一點，所以表面怕他，實際並不怕他；雖不怕他，却又不敢擴張過急，以防激怒於他。因此，第三種人此際對於多少獵物，還只能陰謀撒網，而不獲立即鯨吞。這是他們目前最大的憾事。</p>
<p>今後之第二種人，如其不加愼重考慮，而徒唱高調，講開放，這對於第三種人，可說是正中下懷，而把世界上眞正愛好和平佔最大多數的第一種人，却陷於無邊苦海了！</p>

<h3>軟弱的光緒帝</h3>
<p>— 陶熊</p>
<p>讀「清宮外史」</p>
<p>光緒皇帝，這可憐的人兒！他自己沒有主張，有了主張又不敎去做，做了又怕他母親　備。因此，他只能把別人的意志當做自己的意志，走着別人替他安排好的路，等待着別人所賜給他的命運，結果、害了他自已也害了別人。把一份大好江山給帝國主義者東宰西割，弄得七零八落，若是他早就很有主張地決定做着一切，不管慈禧太后替他安排的道路，以國家社會老百姓做前題，談起家庭革命的時候就起，寗願不當皇帝，意志卻非要不可！那麽，中國還不會給弄得一敗塗地！</p>
<p>不過，光緒　帝還是一個好人，是一個叫人可憐的沒用的好人。他自己沒有意志，也不敢有意志。慈禧太后要他喜歡他所討厭的人，要他娶一個他所不愛的人，他不敢不聽，更不敢不要！但這些痛苦也只有他自己知道！這是他自己沒有意志和沒有毅力所應得的報應！應吃的酸果！</p>
<p>這些個人的小事他都沒有勇氣去解決，怎麽會有勇氣去解決國家大事呢？只能讓他的母后去獨掌大權解決一切麽。因此，把這大好河山弄得一團糟！幾次割地賠款，喪權辱國，把個國家弄得千瘡百孔！</p>
<p>不論是大人物或者是小人物，你什麼都可以不要，但你的意志却非要不可！毅力却不可沒有！否則，你會弄得後悔莫及！悔恨終年的！意志不堅定，性格柔弱的人們，你們可以去看看這前車之　的「淸宮外史」里的光緒皇帝！</p>
<h3>看「清宮外史」排演</h3>
<p>— 蕭</p>
<p>剛由南京來，臉上的灰塵還沒洗，就到海格路中電劇團去看一個朋友，沒想到，會見了這麽多朋友，全是重慶來的。他們正在排「淸宮外史」第一部，這麽熱的天，搖着扇子都還嫌熱，他們却穿了龍袍朝靴，悠悠然的在滿淸時代的宮闕下討生活！導演仍舊是楊村彬先生，自己編自己導可以隨心所欲的將設計的東西都搬到舞台上去。這一批工作態度嚴肅的好演員不會使這個戲失敗的。</p>
<p>排演室裘，除了導演及演員們的聲音外沒有任何吵雜，他們在靜悄悄的，一遍一遍又一遍的排練；沒有煩躁，沒有怨言，他們在虛心的學習，因爲他們認爲「眞正的藝術品」是不容易產生的！用欺騙的行爲去博取觀衆的喝采是可恥的！除了演員；服裝效果等工作人員的工作熱情，也眞使人佩服！那麽多占色古査的衣裳，一根帶子，一頂帽子，一會拿服裝給這個人穿，一會記住給那一位修改。效果呢？鼓點敲得不對，一次又一次。……這些無名英雄們低着頭在那兒幹！他們是小心的戰戰兢兢的等待這個『藝術品』的誕生！</p>
<p>戲排完了，我忘記了有灰塵的臉，疲乏的身子，我忘記了去！我看着這些年靑的朋友們，又恢復了猴子般的跳躍，打鬧，玩笑，在工作後來一個「喜劇式的舒解」。我想，這才是嚴　的工作，活潑的生活，我依戀着對朋友說：</p>
<p>「晚上還排嗎？」</p>
<p>「排！怎麼能不排。十分戲，現在還沒完成五分！」他一邊擦汗，一邊把服裝脫下來，摺好交給管服裝的工作人員。</p>
<p>「這點可以拿出去了！我看得忘記了我在那兒了！」</p>
<p>「不够！不够！差遠了！還得加油呵！——這一砲，不知給正在走下坡路的話劇，起點什麼反響？……」感槪頗多……</p>
<p>從重慶沿水路而下過宜昌·漢口·南京。碰見許多從事話劇工作的朋友們，都是搖頭嘆氣；這年頭的戲難幹，賠錢貨！用大量的資本培植出來的戲，所吸取來的觀衆是寥寥無幾，賠錢，負債，以致第二個戲無法再上，走了幾個地方都是一般情形，據聞上海也是如此。到底是什麽原因呢？是受內戰影饗，生活程度高，苛捐雜稅多。觀衆的薪金買不起一張戲票呢？還是幹戲的不學無術，不求進步，使熱愛話劇的觀衆失望，而不願再到劇塲裏來受罪，情願去找點別的刺激呢？這確是一個値得研究的問題，吾則，整個的話劇運動將不堪設想了，希望這次，觀衆演出公司的「淸宮外史」，能在虛心的學習中得到成功！這第一砲，會是個「冲天砲」！跟曾經遺棄過話劇的觀衆們，再回到劇塲裏來吧！這公司是爲你們——親愛的觀衆們預備的！</p>
<p>觀衆演出公司的「清宮外史」今晚在辣斐正式演出了，這不僅止是觀衆的一個好消息，並且也意味着一個新的開始。</p>
<h3>清宮外史演出</h3>
<p>— 虞平</p>
<p>劇運在走着低潮，劇壞上是一片混亂，敗倒的敗倒，改行的改行，胡攪的胡攪，而認眞地嚴肅地工作的人，却蒙受着無限的痛苦鬱悶與迫害，我們把造成如此混亂的原因歸罪於社會的不安定，但演劇工作者自身也沒有付出多少力量，他們或者逃避，或者視若無睹，或者退讓，只有少數人在堅持，堅守着崗位，堅持着一個嚴肅的態度，而在堅持之外更投身於努力奮鬥，掃除陰霾，積極建設的人更是不可多見了，在這情形之下，戲劇運動在多方壓迫下怎麽會抬頭，翻身？</p>
<p>「觀衆演出公司」的成立給劇運帶來了新的希望，他們是「苦幹」「中電」綜合的化身，是一羣聰明的傻子，他們在脫去舊衣裳後立刻又站起來套上新裝，他們過去的作風與藝術態度已經爲人所稱道，如今，他們特別强調了「爲觀衆（可不是迎合觀衆）而存在，而服務，而盡忠」的決心，因此，我相信他們將會更爲觀衆所愛戴。</p>
<p>他們的第一次演出「清宮外史」是非常適當的，第一，這是一齣富有現實主義精神的歷史劇，在歷史的觀點上，在寫作的技巧上都有很高的成就；第二，這不是一齣說敎的戲，又美妙而生動，感人至深。第三，牠有一羣輝煌的活生生的人物。加上苦幹中電一羣傷秀的演員與舞台工作者的精心創造，我相信，這個演出將在劇運進程上劃下一道標記。</p>
<h3>王者之師的翁同龢，張雁在淸宮外史中</h3>
<p>淸宮裏的人物自右至左：晋　皇后（莫愁），珍妃（　薇），慈禧太后（葉子），瑾妃（謝怡冰），李姐兒（傅惠珍）。</p>
<h3>對觀眾演出公司的祝福與願望</h3>
<p>— 靜文</p>
<p>中國人是最怕「絕後」的，前些時正當劇壇兩個年靑有爲的夥子——中電與苦幹倒下去，而活着的又帶着病體苦爭苦鬥，奄奄一息的時候，敏感的人都在担心話劇是否會從此就「絕」掉了「後」，從此就無聲無息，變成一個無聲的劇場了，而恰當其時，「觀衆演出公司」出世了，這確是喜訊，總算話劇「香煙」繼承有人，不致把個「後」給絕掉了。</p>
<p>年來話劇所受的迫害，說不完，訴不盡，眞個是一把辛酸的眼淚，而如今勝利了，却只要槍桿不要文化，內戰的砲火把人們的幸福和希望摧毀得一無所餘，劇壇也被轟聲得滿目瘡痍，荒凉一片。「觀衆演出公司」出生在這樣一個苦難的時代，我們眞祖心這小生命怎樣渡過這一段驚險的途程。</p>
<p>然而，我們看到了，道小生命是茁壯和頑强得可愛的，不怕風，不怕雨，而就在漫天地風喪雨裏站起來，槓着鋤頭去重新整理，墾植這一塊摧殘得荒凉破碎的土地，他們自信得讓人覺得希望和光明和他們站在一起。</p>
<p>一開始他們就知道：戲和觀衆是分不開的，沒有觀衆還會有什麼戲？戲是屬於觀衆的，正如同一個民主的政府屬於人民的一樣。得到觀衆的扶持和營養，這小生命才能壯大起來，他們是和觀衆相依爲命的，觀衆愛的他們愛，觀衆憎惡的，他們也都憎惡</p>
<p>如今他們要演出「淸宮外史」了，他們將第一次受到觀衆們公正的考騐。</p>
<p>除祝福他們外，另有六願：</p>
<p>一願「觀演」長命百歲。</p>
<p>二願劇壇欣欣向榮。</p>
<p>三願捐稅不再增加。</p>
<p>四願劇人生活安定。</p>
<p>五願演出不受阻碍。</p>
<p>六願劇運一帆風順。</p>

<p>看吧！上海電影院所開映的影片中，十有八九是以色情來號召的。許許多多的靑年，被沉醉在這迷霧中。捨此以外，無非是胡鬧而毫無意義的影片，來迎合一般低級趣味的觀衆。可是這種影片，對於國家的文化，可說是一個嚴重的打擊，也可說是一個致命的創傷。但是在這個時候，一部包含正義感的國產巨片，與上海人士相見了，這就是「忠義之家」的演出，創我電影界罕有之光彩。</p>
<p>「忠義之家」的內容，是敍述一門三代的忠貞，在抗戰八年之巾，始終在威武不屈，貧賤不移之下，與敵人作殊死的奮鬥。這部影片，靠了編導者高超的手法，及演員們嚴肅的演技，博得一致的好評。其中男主角由劉瓊主演，也是本片中最成功的一個演員。他身兼二角，一飾服務空軍的愛國者華維綱，一飾白髮蒼蒼年老的祖父華耿齋，他把二者的氣魄，在不同的動作上，言語上表揚出來。這種成功的確並不是偶然的，完全是由他純熟的演技，及精粹的國語中獲得的。女主角秦怡飾的是維綱之妻，也就是耿齋的媳婦，有幾幕演得很能感動人。其他如葉小珠飾的孫兒大民，嚴肅飾的韓國青年，田鈞飾的空軍同志，他們都把愛國的情緒發揮無遺。韓濤，方伯，莊凱　等演得也不錯，爲此片增色不少。</p>
<p>看完了這部「忠義之家」電影的觀衆們，他們的腦海中都會鈎起無限的感概的。封鎖，擠戶口米，凡是在淪陷區的同胞，那一個沒有嚐到此辛酸的滋味，憑藉敵偽的勢力，爲虎作倀，魚肉鄉民的漢奸，固然要受國法的制裁。但是法西斯殘酷的蹂躪，我們是永遠不能把牠忘掉的，反正一片血眼，我們還得要向他們淸算，大國民風度要有限度的。</p>
<p>總而言之，這是一部血和淚的寫眞。最後筆者虔誠地貢介紹「忠義之家」於全上海市民之前。</p>
<p>舞台技術講話</p>
<h3>服裝與色彩</h3>
<p>— 文泉</p>
<p>由於人文的進化，服裝上的色彩，已成爲新時代的畫筆，它說明了李候，說明了民族的特性，給人類精神以新的展示。它　倣自然，壓縮宇宙的華美及人類的思想於經緯之上。濃　勝過自然，具體勝過史籍，它成了人類的寵兒，人類的益友！</p>
<p>從個人方面說，它說明了人物的個性，年齡，身份，季候，和突發的事件（如婚喪等），且能極正確，極敏銳迅速地預示給別人。</p>
<p>它在物質發達的社會裏，正試着擊破人們爲服裝而服裝的習慣，代替以爲色彩而服裝的威力。這種威力遂逐漸增高了他的藝術價値。</p>
<p>在戲劇中，它這種權能均將盡　的允許發揮，而且深獲劇藝的歡迎。莫德威（H.K.Moderwell）說：「舞合畫面是生動的，戲劇性的；它的特殊的美，是在於行動，在於人的參加活動。它是動的，而繪畫是靜的，因此，舞台畫面便便有大的活力，與鮮明的對照。」他在這裏說明了兩點：舞台畫面是動的，而這動又必須有行動的人去參加，然後才能產生畫面偉大的活力，服裝上的色彩，既然附着於有行動的人的身上，在精神上（戲劇的），在形象上（繪畫上），它都是促使舞台畫面動的有力的因素，這因素揮發着人類精神的衝突，使無相的畫面成爲有相，使環境與人物如大氣之與地球萬物，產生必然的因果，生死的關聯。同時，它微着人物的行動，使靜的繪畫藝術成爲動的裝　藝術。它做着人類與上帝的媒介，便萬物生，使宇宙榮，完成燦爛的劇藝。</p>
<p>茲舉巴克斯特（Benois）替鄧南遮D'Annunxio計的La　Pisanall。中，找一找服裝色彩在全劇色彩中發生偉大成功的證明：</p>
<p>序幕中，他在一間深紫色與鮮緣色，加以金色裝飾，富有宗敎氣息的富麗內景中，以鮮黃（皇后衣）與魚鮮紅（太子衣）的兩種極强的補色，介紹了兩位主要人物。接着第一幕他在粗黑綫條下，舖上一片暖熱的橘紅色，鈎劃出一個碇船的碼頭。在這碼頭上來了無數富麗熱色雜亂的求婚者，向一個女奴求婚。後來王子來了，披着白衣，騎着白馬，當女奴接受了王子底愛的時候，她便披上了王子的白衣，騎着白馬走了。</p>
<p>第二幕他用冷靜的純藍色，程式化的畫上白色的圖案適中略加一點紅橙色的筆觸，修道女都穿着白色與灰藍色的衣服，整個寺院充滿了和平與幽靜，常這寺院被Antlock底王子帶着妓女進來藝瀆時，一種鮮　的，世俗的色彩，便把這幕幽靜的景象破壞了。</p>
<p>第三幕他們回到宮殿中底榮華與殘忍中La　Pisanell因皇后底陰謀將被處死。這一幕用的幕布是深緣加上金色圖案，整個的色彩構颺極其複雜，但値得一提的，在全幕中有一種特殊的紅色，深淡不等，逐漸變深。近結局時，紅色更深而發紫，最後奴隷仍入塲，均穿着紫紅的服裝，帶來了一堆紫紅色的花束這熱極了的色彩，終於把這女子窒死了。</p>
<p>他這種大胆的運用色彩，獲得了永垂不朽的聲望。也證明了服裝上色彩的威力，確實有助於戲劇。</p>
<h3>精緒的滌凈</h3>
<p>— 管玉</p>
<p>一幅白絹上有了汚點，可以放在淸水里去洗一洗，使它回復到潔白。</p>
<p>一個人的心靈里，有了情緒上的煩惱只有藝術能够使它回復到平靜。</p>
<p>戲劇藝術必須有「滌凈」的作用。它必須要使劇塲里的觀衆忘掉自己，否則這劇本的演出就是失敗。</p>
<p>有進步意識的劇本是我們需要的。有戲劇性的劇本更是我們所需要的。這兩者合而爲一的劇本，一定是一部成功的好劇本！也必定是觀衆所喜歡，所眾於接受的劇本！</p>
<p>很多只有進步意識的劇本，很爲智識份子所歡迎，但它不一定給所有的觀衆歡迎！</p>
<p>很多當於戲劇性的劇本，很受觀衆的歡迎，但它不一定被智識階級的人士所愛好！</p>
<p>很多觀衆走進劇塲是爲了娛樂，不是爲了被敎育。眞正的藝術工作者是爲了社會敎育，不是被娛樂。這里面的距離該如何細的把它們拉近，這該是劇作者的責任！</p>
<p>劇本必須有力量控制觀衆的情感！觀眾走出劇塲也必須要覺得有一股力量在壓着他。否則，雙方的目的都沒有達到！藝術工作者沒有達到敎育的目的，觀衆沒有得到姨樂的結果！</p>
<p>觀衆在無一聊煩惱的時候才走進劇塲，劇塲不能使他滿足，他就會站起來走！爲了愛好而來的觀衆只是全數中的最少數，把他看作重要得如同吃飯的觀衆，是少數中的最少數了！</p>
<p>藝術工作者千不要綳着臉對觀衆說：我是在敎育你！</p>
<p>觀衆不能接受，也不要說：智識水準太低！</p>
<p>一切的一切，都該從你本身做起。無論如何，應該先讓觀衆能接受你的東西。但你不可迎合觀衆！</p>
<p>觀衆是一幅有了汚點的白絹，藝術工作者是一泓淸水，常觀衆走出劇塲的時候，你必須使他這一幅白絹回復到潔白！</p>

<h3>文藝復興與作家友情</h3>
<p>— 華林</p>
<p>前次春秋副刋上，發表一篇『文人友情與政治關係』，言之至爲懇切，世上最可寶貴的是友情，况且文藝家在自然界中，所愛慕的對象，是江上淸風與山間明月，絕不是利祿富貴；即使文藝家與聞政事，也不是政客投機之流，他有一種愛國熱情，或是挽救世界與人道的思想！</p>
<p>文藝家變成政客，拿文藝做了爭權奪利的工具，這種文藝家，自然不會有『眞實的友情』！更無法把這些投機分子，聯合成一體，現在我們需要的就是友情，由眞實友誼上從事文藝復興遝動，然後我們的工作纔能開始。今先舉一件事，請大家商榷，指敎：</p>
<p>我們常有會面聚談的機會。最好在地點適中</p>
<p>，交通方便的地方，徵求選定一二咖啡館或茶室</p>
<p>，與店主入說明，每週輪流一二日，特約合作，</p>
<p>做爲文藝家聚會之處。羅馬的『公道地』巴黎的</p>
<p>『蒙巴拉司』皆有文藝咖啡館。在重慶時期，我</p>
<p>們也曾有過「星期六晚茶」的聚會。</p>
<p>這不過是一種作家的聯誼，然而是我們的迫切的要求！先由眞實的友情入手，然後努力本地方上的文化建設，成立各種文學藝術的學會，建議國家保障作家生活，補助研究與出版事業，就可以再推廣到全國成爲一致地運動。此次大戰後，我們所接受的敎訓，誰也不能外世界而生存，整個世界，關係至爲密切，無論世界任何一部分的角落裏，都能影響到全世界的安危！所以我們更要進一步，溝通中西文化，接受世界新潮流，洗刷中國的腐敗空氣。</p>
<p>我們從事文藝復興遝動，當然應該從作家聯誼入手，而以「全世界」爲目標，我們把中國固有的文化，發揚光大，貢獻到世界上去，世界上任何學術思想，都薈萃在中國，安定世界未來的命運！</p>
<p>政治關係是一時的，友情是不朽的！友情的擴大纔有人生的趣味。「以文會友，以友輔仁。』『風雨如晦，鷄鳴不已。』惟超功利的博愛思想，纔能有眞實的友情！唯眞實的友情，纔能展開新時代的文藝復興運動！</p>
<h3>杯</h3>
<p>— 浩然</p>
<p>拿起一隻光明澄澈潔白可愛的玻璃杯，我默默地浸在一池沉思的靜水中了！的確，我愛它，並不是因爲它輕巧而玲琍，高貴而富麗，而是爲了它深深地代表着眞摯的感情，人生的滋味！</p>
<p>沒有一個人能够一天離得了杯，正如沒有一尾魚能够一刻出得了水，因爲它緊緊地和生活連繫在一起，離了杯的人就像出了水的魚，縱能於極短的時間內苟延殘喘，而死神的唇邊却已展開會心的微笑；他將無法感受上帝的普愛的恩澤，一個冥冥的世界正爲着他而打開幽黯的門牆！</p>
<p>然而，人們所祈求的不是平平淡淡的生，無聲無臭的生……</p>
<p>假使說，人生是一張平白光潔的紙張，那末杯便是一把紅黃藍紫的彩色筆；假使說，人生是一碗透明冷淡的淸水，那末杯子便是一隻甜酸苦辣的五味瓶；它會使無色的生色，乏味的出味，雖則有些色調是濃郁的，有些味道是辛酸的。這不是人們的喜愛奇特，不甘平凡，實由於造物者的可無抗拒的擺布。</p>
<p>是的，世途是崎嶇的，生活是動盪的，感情之流是海濱的潮汐，而非池塘的秋水，歡笑，熱淚，浩嘆和激怒交織成人生的圖案。賀生的欣悅還在，而弔死的哀愁復生，團聚爲好友洗塵的筵席未散，又當匆匆舉起了餞送的離杯，有什麽力量，可以促使你循着一定的生活的軌跡？有什麼髮梳，可以爲你整理心緒的亂絲？生，離，死，別，喜，怒，哀，樂，堂上，靈前，笑聲里，淚光中，不是時時地地都離不了，隻杯嗎？</p>
<p>不但是生活的水源，感情的擊絲，杯，也是一種和平的象徵！野蠻的禽獸需要着飲料，但牠不能用杯；作戰的士兵渴望着水汁，但他也沒有餘暇可以舉杯；只有香檳酒氣洋溢之地，才是和平安樂所及之區。一杯在手，萬念皆消，多少敵意與妒忌，多少罪惡和陰謀，多少不幸和幽怨，都在晶晶的玉液中化爲烏有！假如世界各國的元首都能於每年的聖誕節見面一次，開誠相談，舉杯互祝，則戰爭的慘禍必因之而减少，人類的生活也許會更幸福</p>
<p>拿起你的杯，痛飲一口吧！祝和平的奠立，和生命的永恒！</p>
<h3>風雨江上</h3>
<p>— 嘯風</p>
<p>怒風吹過江頭，捲起一片波濤。突兀的浪頭互相擁抱着，在推進，在擴散，在沉重地激盪着岸邊的岩石。</p>
<p>雨絲，在狂風裏，像輕烟，像　霧，瀰漫在嘉陵江上。雨滴不斷地洒落在江心裏，在浪頭上激起了密密的小圈。隨着那突兀的波濤，在推進，在擴散。</p>
<p>風雨中，江岸上的小店，顯得那麽冷落。雨水從稻草蓋成的屋頂上流下來，傾注在小水溝裏，急促地流向江邊去。人們都躲進屋裏去了，小店的主人，也把那擺設雜物的太攤搬了進去。</p>
<p>狹小的茶店中，避雨的人們像江上的風濤，動盪，呼笑。喧嚷的聲音，和屋外的風雨呼應。</p>
<p>在風雨飄打的江岸上，已沒有行人了。舟子們把自己的小船泊近江岸，把船頭上的鐵鍊緊繫在岩石上面，然後靜靜地在船艙裏坐下來，燃起一支粗劣的烟，默默地望着那風雨飄打的江面。</p>
<p>上行的木船，慢慢地爬過了灘頭，縴夫們卸掉背上的繩索。在風雨巾，他們赤着的身體浸在水中，騷亂地向船邊奔去。</p>
<p>木船進灣了，摸篙的放下手中的篙竿，在船頭上收抬縴索，把一條長的縴繩從江上拉起來，捲作一圈，放在船上。船掉轉了頭，停泊在江灣裏，躱避這江上的風波。</p>
<p>一隻無蓬的漁舟，正從遠處划過來。年靑的漁家女郞用力把漁網拉起，支架在船頭上。雨水浸濕了她的頭髮，浸濕了她的衣服。年老的漁父正用力地搖着槳，把小船划向前去。雨珠凝結在他的鬍鬚上，雨水在他眼角邊的皺紋裏流着。</p>
<p>「爸爸，我們回去嘍！」女兒掉過頭來，望着她的父親說。</p>
<p>「好大的雨啊！」年老的漁父低低咕囉着，像在咀咒，又像在歎息。咆哮的風，答應着他。</p>
<p>在溜了級的風裏，密密的雨點，不歇地洒落到江心，在波濤上激起了無窮的小圈，隨着浪頭推進，擴散，激盪着那岸邊的岩石。</p>
<h3>舞罷　（和闐舞星）</h3>
<p>— 司徒喬</p>
<h3>團山堡讀書</h3>
<p>— 宗白華</p>
<p>前年盟軍攻佔羅馬後，新聞記者去訪問隱居在羅馬近郊的當代大哲桑達耶那（Santayana），一位八十高齡的老人，仍然精神矍鑠地探索着這人生之謎，不感疲倦。記者問他對這次世界大戰的意見，羅馬近郊是那麽接近砲火底中心。桑達耶那悠然地答道：「我已經多時沒有報紙了，我現在常常生活在永恒的世界裏！』</p>
<p>什麽是這可愛可羨的永恒世界呢？</p>
<p>我幾年因避空襲——並不是避現實——住在柏溪對江大保附近的農家，在這狂濤駭浪的大時代中我的生活却像一泓池沼，祇照映着大保的松間明月，江上淸風。我的心底深暗處永遠潛伏一種渴望，渴望着熱的生命，廣大的世界，涓消的細流企向着大海。</p>
<p>今年一個夏晚，司徒喬卿兄突然見訪。闊別已經數年了，我忙問他別後的行踪，他說他這幾年是『東西南北之人」。先到過中國的東南角，後遊中國的西北角，從南海風光到沙漠情調，他心靈體騐的廣袤是旣廣且深，作畫無數。我聽了異常驚喜，我說我一定要來看你的創作，塡補我這幾年精神的寂寞。到了九月廿六日我同吳子咸兄相約同往金剛坡團山堡去訪司徒喬卿兼踐傅抱石兄之宿的。不料團山堡四週風景眞能入畫，背面高峯入雲，時隱時現，前面一望廣闊，而遠山如環，氣象萬千，不必南海塞北，即此已是他的「大海」了。入夜松際月出，尤爲淸寂。抱石來暢談極樂。决晨，即求喬卿展示所作。因有一大部正付裝裱，未獲窺及全豹，頗爲悵悵。然就所見，已深感喬卿兄視覺之深，興趣之廣博，技術之熟練，而允令我滿意的，是他能深深地體會和表現那原始意味的，純樸的宗敎情操，西北沙漠中這種最可寶貴，最可艷羨的篤厚的宗敎情調，這渾樸的元氣，眞是够味。回看我們都會中那些心靈早已淘空了的行尸走肉，能不令人作嘔！「晨　」「大荒飲馬」「馬程歸來」「天山秋水」「茶叙」「冰川歸人」等等，他們的美，不只是在形象，色調，技法，而是在這一切裏面，透露的情調氣氛，絲毫不頹廢的深情與活力，這是我們藝術所需要的，更是我們民族品德所需要的。所以我希望喬卿的畫展能發生精神敎育的影響。</p>
<p>但喬卿旣能畫熱情動人，活潑飛躍的舞女，引起我對生命的渴望，感到身體底節拍，而他又畫得輕靈似夢，幽深如詩的美景，令人心醉，其味更爲雋永。大槪因爲我們是東方人罷，對這「淸靜境」，對這「默」，允對那幅「再會」，感到裏面有說不盡的意味。書家在這裏用新的構圖，新的配色，寫出我們心中永恒的最深的音樂；在這裏，表面上似乎是新的形式，而骨子裏是東方人悠古的世界感觸。在這裘我懷疑喬卿受了他夫人伊湄的潛移默化，因爲這裏面頗具有着伊湄女士所寫詞美中的意境。據說伊湄女士是司徒先生每一創作最先的一個深刻的批評者。</p>
<p>我在團山堡畫室裏住了兩夜，飽看山光雪影，夜月晨曦，讀喬卿的畫，伊湄的詞，第二天又去打擾傳抱石兄，欣賞他近年作品和夫人的烹調。一件意外底收穫，就是得到一册司徒圓（喬卿的長女）從四歲到九歲所寫的小詩，加上抱石兄的一樣年齡的長子小石的插畫，册名「浪花」，是郭沫若兄在政治部四維小叢書裏出版的。這本小書裏洋溢着天眞的靈感，今人生最純凈的愉快。司徒圓四歲半在滬粵舟中寫第一首小詩：</p>
<p>「浪花白，浪花美，</p>
<p>朶朶浪花，朶朶白玫瑰。」</p>
<p>天眞的想像，天眞的音調，天眞的措詞，眞是有味。又「大海水」一首：</p>
<p>「大海水，眞怪氣，</p>
<p>雨來會生瘡，風來會皺皮。」</p>
<p>又「大雨」一首；</p>
<p>「大雨紛紛下，</p>
<p>樹木都很佩服他，</p>
<p>樹木不停地鞠躬，</p>
<p>把腰彎到地下。」</p>
<p>這裏是眞的世界，童眞的世界就是桑達耶那所常住的永恒世界吧？</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　40</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>大槪歷來日人軍政首腦人物。都要熟讀我國「戰國策」，奉爲「國策聖典」，無論對內對外，一有行動，來不來就要摘取戰國策中一二條方案，依樣　蘆，表演一下。這裏所謂「刼持案內」，大槪就是曹沫刼桓公，藺相如刼秦王的辦法，不過加上現代綁匪作風罷了。</p>
<p>第二步，如若綁架不成，就因「强刼案內」那就是「硬做」，把幾位重要人物就地刺殺，無論刺殺的成績如何，第二步就發動武力佔領。這正式發動武力的日子，因爲歷來迷信關係，必得有個「八」，所以擇定二十八日拂曉攻擊。所以明天後天（廿六·廿七，）必是一們緊張的關頭。</p>
<p>我把鶴見這件秘密電訊，通知了W君之後W君因爲不能在電話裏三言兩語說明，又怕走漏了消息，所以叫我就近去同王冷齋說明，並且就地貢獻一點意見。</p>
<p>從長辛店到宛平，祇有那麼有限的小小一段路，無奈這時，宛平一帶，都有日人的所謂「便衣步哨」其實就是特工隊和浪人，以及雇用的中國下三等暴徒無賴等，伏在田埂，暗陬黑角地方，祇要看見衣冠稍爲整齊點的單身行人，或則隨意一槍；或則御了就走，作爲敲詐勒贖的肉票。如係這被綁的人，是個窮人，村農，詐不出油水來，必彼槍殺，或迫做苦役。這麽一來，可以造成一個恐怖，混亂的局面，人心不搖自動。</p>
<p>我因事情緊急，勢在必行，便同〇四號商定了一個安全辨法。我們這一站，（連〇四號在內）共有五個上等射手，便安排了一個「彈性步哨」；山〇四號在我前而做前驅，保持十多米距離；其餘四人更前一步，在左右二十米外探索前進，探索到四五十米遠近，建立臨時哨崗，等〇四號一到，放了暗號，則又繼續向前探索等等。</p>
<p>其實我們很可以弄一部車子，一陣風，直趨宛平，無奈我們不願驚動敵人；並且一旦驚動了敵人，他們勢必大驚小怪，沒法追踪尋跡；如此，我們的電訊站，就有暴露的危險。</p>
<p>九點左右，我們已經安抵宛平，冷齋先生已在那裏坐候。我先把秘密電訊內容，詳述一過，又把W君的辦法吿訴了他。冷齋這人，氣度非凡；一聽他發言，就知道他學識閱歷，都有獨到之處。無怪三番五轉，日人在他而前，强詞奪理，都被他折服下去，無言可答。像這樣的才具，要是把他放在宋哲元或韓復榘的地位上，當抗戰之初，我怕日寇就難得渡過黃河。就算渡了河，也沒有那麽容易南下。</p>
<p>我們繼續討論了一會，我又貢獻了一個方法，可以輕而易舉，破解日人第一二兩步陰謀；他一聽之下，略一沉吟，就說「十分妥當」。我們又議定了把這破解方式，分途通知幾位重要人物的程序，和我們彼此之間，在電話裏暗通消息的隱語。萬一這個方法，被當地最高當局拒絕了，我們就使用議妥的補救辦法。</p>
<p>回長辛店的路上，因爲已過夜半，沿途比較危險。我記得我們一共遭遇過不下四五起特工的伏崗，有時是一人，有的竟有兩三人。這却不能客氣，我們只能把他們一一除掉。因爲萬一走掉一個，我們就有無限麻煩。</p>
<p>問到電訊站，我們的火本營，已經是上午兩點多鐘了。雖說十分疲倦，精力還能　持，便立即擬了兩個密碼報吿，一個回覆W君，一個通知鶴見，說明這邊全盤應付日人「三部進行曲」陰謀的辦法。臨到休息，又草了一個便條，叫人一到早飯後，便送到鼎元那裏，約他前來談話。</p>

<h3>太虛</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>因爲市參議會通過了「請市府配撥自治機構辦公房屋以利推行自治案」，其中有「撥用或借用寺廟及公共建築物」一項，致引起本市若干寺廟的和尙向參議會結隊請願。</p>
<p>我想起了現在上海的太虛法師，法師爲什麼保持沉默呢？</p>
<p>卅二年七月，在重慶，曾經作北溫泉之遊，上縉　山，參觀了那時設在縉雲寺的漢藏敎理學院，並和該院主持人太虛法師談了幾分鐘的話。</p>
<p>我並未說明我是個新聞記者，我是以普通遊客的身份和他見面的，在短短的十幾分錡內，除了由他率領說明瀏覽了他訪問印度所帶回的若干紀念品外，我將所有的時間用在注視這位佛敎一代聖宗。我希望從他的氣宇神色體魄和行動談吐中，讀出這位宗敎虔信者的不同凡俗之處，至於他對於佛學上的創見和闡釋，他的幾部著作是足以說明的了。</p>
<p>我對於法師祇有一個印象，他是一個爐火純靑的人。這爐火純靑四字也許就是一般人的道法甚深的設法。見解，閱歷，修養，到某種程度以上，人的氣度自然而然地表現着一種安詳着實與深沉，這一感覺我在于斌主敎身上也同樣接觸到的。</p>
<p>法師不僅在宗敎哲學上有造詣，他對於政治社會也同樣有深刻的認識，抗戰八年中，他並不是以一個方外人在遨遊名山大川，或是隱遯在深寺古剎中度青罄紅魚的生活。這是我們大家都知進的。</p>
<p>因之，關於此次市參議會的一　用或借用寺廟及公共建築物」一決議案，希望法師來乘此機會加以說明，將他個人的對現實政治　　的埋解，傳達給佛敎子弟。</p>
<p>國外瑣聞</p>
<h3>吻無害</h3>
<p>— 達明</p>
<p>〔編者按〕這篇文章是女作家謝冰心女士的丈夫寫的；他硏究自然科學，他在這篇文章里特別强調健康的男女接吻，並沒有傳遞唇上病菌的危險，雖然女的塗着口紅。〕</p>
<p>美國大孩子們的天眞活潑，眞是越出我們大國縉紳的理想，他們情願讓黃包車夫坐上車子，自己拚命拉起車子來，跑得滿頭大汗，或者加在地上讓檢煤渣的　孩子們當馬騎，這叫我們那些道貌岸然的紳士和金玉其外的小姐們看起來，眞是有些不雅。然而，這裏還有一件更叫他們覺得驚異的事。</p>
<p>在華盛頓大學裏的細菌學　上最近作過一次硏究接吻是否會傳染疾病的試騐，據說這次的科學研究最成功的了。試騐的結果可以證明健康的人接吻並不會傳染甚　疾病　。」</p>
<p>四對學生試吻</p>
<p>在試騐之前，生物系的一位敎授很審愼地，從班中選出了四位健康的男學生和四位健康的女學生，配成四對，讓他們在校園裘，課室外面，很自然地擁抱接吻，而接吻的方法和心情，要愈逼　愈好。但是在吻過之後，每一個人都要馬一　　菌培養　很快　接一次</p>
<p>細菌培養皿是一個圓形的淺玻皿，直徑有三寸多，高度不到一寸。有底有蓋。培養基有的是用牛肉　湯，再加些石花菜，熱　傾到細菌培養皿的底中，冷却後便成了凉粉似的凍子，蓋好之後，經過殺菌工作。便可應用。如果有細菌或者胞子落在培養基上，再保持在適當的溫度中，細曲便可滋長。經過相當時間，原來的每一個細菌或胞子。都可以　成一簇菌，那麼用肉眼便很容易看出來的。仔細數數細菌的　數，就可以代表原有細菌究竟是多少。學生們的嘴唇上如常有　　，經過接吻培養基之後，有　函類便會落到上面</p>
<p>這些吻過的細菌培養皿就被放在恒溫器內，讓細菌滋長，準備施行嚴密的檢査，是否這些人接吻過的嘴唇上會染着致病的菌類。</p>
<p>在一位名叫哈瑞遜的唇上，有少許的葡萄狀的球菌，和一些靑黴—盤尼西林黴，這都是無害的。在一位剛從空軍裏復員來的一位學生的唇上僅僅發現有極少的葡萄狀球菌，這算是最淸潔的一個。</p>
<p>女生唇上的菌</p>
<p>女生嘴唇上的菌類比男生的多得多，原因是女生多施粉脂，而粉脂帶去的菌類比起自然獲得的要多幾倍。但是並沒鵝發現甚麼可以致病的菌類。</p>
<p>這個成功的硏究很可以表現出美國大孩子們的天眞活潑，同時又對那些喜歡接吻的人給予了一個有力的保證。但是我懷疑在僞君子的社會中，能不能作出這種成績來呢？</p>
<h3>自殺</h3>

<h3>都市之瘤　性病與娼妓</h3>

<p>據　察局行政處六月間估計，上海妓女約有五六萬人。按照警察。衛生兩局規定，本市妓女須往南黃陂路「性病防治所」檢騐身體，然後對無疾病者發給營業執照。從今年二月十六日起至六月六日止，計有六百零一家妓院，妓女一千七百七十七人到院候騐。檢査結果：其中患梅毒者八百零五人，子宮病者八百八十人。其餘四萬餘朱經檢騐的私娼，情形當也相彷，傳播性病，流毒社會，眞是何堪設想！</p>
<p>前北平燕京大學美籍敎授花克，曾於一九三四年，週遊列國，考察各國娼妓制度，並將各國都市娼妓與人口比較，作成統計表；計：倫敦九百六十人中有妓女一人，柏林五百八十人中有一人，巴黎四百八十一人中有一人，芝加哥四百三十人中有一人，東京一百五十人中有一人，北平二百五十人中有一人，而紀錄最高的，却是上海，計一百三十人中間，即有妓女一人。</p>
<p>可怕的數字</p>
<p>二十六年六月，上海泰晤士報曾揭露一個可驚的事實。「據婦女團體近數月調查，公共租界內共有婦女三十四萬九千七百四十四人，操淫業者的二萬五千人。法租界內共有婦女二十七萬七千三百人，該租界舉行妓寮登記，登記者共三百九十所，此外尙有一千一百人隨時秘密賣淫，」可見警察局行政處的估計，是有其根據的。</p>
<p>誨淫的著作</p>
<p>上海娼妓之多，淫風之盛，前後巳經持續了七八十年。過去有一般自命風流，無聊無行的文人，曾筆記者書，描述娼妓的史實，不下數十種之多，如「滬淤雜記」，「歇浦芳叢志」，「上海品豔百花圖」，「申江洋塲繁華吟」，「海上羣芳譜」，「春江花史」，「滬江色藝指南」，上海六十年花界史」，「海上繁華夢」，「九尾龜」，「人間地　」，「海上花列傳」……等等，大都用小說體裁。其中也有　寓勸誡之意，不過，無聊而誨浮的居多數。</p>
<p>淸末民初，上海的一般騷人墨客，更異想天開，實行所謂「花國大總統」的選舉，依得票多寡，而定正副，第一次選舉出來的大總統是喚做冠芳老五的妓女。前後舉行十次之多。這個舉動在我們看來，未免荒唐。但在三四十年前，却被日爲風　雅事哩</p>
<p>除上海以外，我國幾個大都市如南京·漢口·北平·廣州幾乎是公私娼的集中地點。據民國二十四年調査所得·廣州一地的娼妓，巳在二萬人以上。</p>
<p>現社會中，生活困難，有些無路可走的婦女，被迫跑到賣淫線上，也有貧窮人家的女孩，被賣與妓院的。另一方面，經濟不景氣，獨身的男子，爲了解決性慾，祇有上妓院尋求滿足。</p>
<p>所以：經濟和生理的原因，造成娼妓問題，始終成爲社會的一種嚴重病態。要想割除這一個都市的毒瘤—娼妓—必須從根本着手，先安定民生，提高婦女的敎育，訓練她們的工作按能，設立婦女救濟院，安置那些孤寡無吿的婦女，這一個辦法至少要比單憑一紙禁令取締有效得多。</p>
<h3>上海禽獸不少</h3>
<p>— 凌雲</p>
<p>吳參議員正矱，鑒于上海禽默太少，主張擴充動物園。但是，如果當局決心要擴充動物園的話，那麼不要說是二處，就是二十處也馬上可以成立。因爲上海各的是「衣冠獸禽」哩！</p>
<p>時事雜感</p>
<h3>溥儀與戰利品</h3>
<p>— 歸舟</p>
<p>日本投降後，有一個國家活像一個失了理性的人，接迎的做了許多莫名其妙的事情。其犖犖大者如阻礙朝鮮獨立，搬走我國在東北的工業設備等不一而足，甚至連數十萬的日俘，也被「匿藏」在西伯利亞，經年而不遣散。世人對此莫不驚訝，日本人更覺焦急，故最近東京卒有三千婦孺遊行請願。幾年前日本婦女曾組織過「索夫團」向政府請願，現在「索夫國」有重新組織的必要吧！</p>
<p>由日俘就連想到溥儀。　儀雖是日本的走狗，但到底他是中國人，應受中國的法律制裁。英勇的紅軍「解放」了東北後，我們很感激，扣押了溥儀，我們也覺得合理，只是爲什麽我國屢决請求把溥儀引渡，而蘇聯却偏不肯答應呢？難道溥儀也是「戰利」品」？麥帥幾度請求，才允許送溥儀到遠東戰罪法庭作證。溥儀在東京除了出庭作證外，就被「匿藏」在蘇聯大使館裘，禁止與外間任何人接觸。他在作證時，曾一再離了題說明蘇聯對束北無野心。其實有無野心，法庭也無櫂過問，所以法官聽了也不耐煩起來。這是件頗堪玩味的事。記得李頓調査團到東北調查時，溥儀也曾懾於日本的威脅，而對調査團說了許多違背良心的話！</p>

<h3>After Victory, the Chairman's First Inspection Tour: The Chairman Flew to Nanchang Last Night, Citizens Emptied Their Homes to Welcome Him with Thunderous Cheers.</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanchang Office, 21st] Chairman Chiang arrived in Nanchang at 5:36 PM on the 21st aboard the special "Meiling" aircraft for his first inspection tour after the victory. The Chairman wore a felt hat and a grass-green Zhongshan suit, appearing energetic and in high spirits. Upon disembarking, he was greeted by the presidium of the welcoming committee, including the Chairman of Jiangxi Province, Wang Lingji; the Chairman of the Provincial Party Headquarters, Chen Zhaoying; the Chief of the Youth Corps, Zhan Chunjian; the Speaker of the Provincial Assembly, Wang Zhenxin; and prominent elders Ouyang Wu, Peng Chengwan, and Gong Shizeng, who paid their respects to the Chairman. Four young ladies, Sheng Qi, Liu Fangnan, Wang Jiaying, and Tao Shengci, stepped forward to present flowers. The Chairman accepted them with a smile, repeatedly saying "Good, good," and shook hands with each of the welcomers. He then smiled and slowly walked out of the airport, accepting the respectful salutes from representatives of the Nanchang government, military, party, and organizations standing along the roadside. The Chairman nodded frequently in response as he passed the welcomers, and upon reaching outside the station, he boarded special car number one with Wang Lingji amidst the melodious military music, and drove to the backyard of the provincial government on Minde Road for a rest. Various leaders from all walks of life among the welcomers, as well as reporters from Jiangxi, Nanjing, Shanghai, and Wuhan newspapers, followed in cars. Over a hundred cars, one after another, made for a spectacular sight.</p>
<p>Two hundred thousand citizens of Nanchang, with extremely joyful hearts, emptied their homes to welcome Chairman Chiang, who had rescued over fourteen million Jiangxi compatriots from fire and water and brought them comfort, whom they had longed to see for twelve years and awaited for seventy days. The welcoming crowds stretched for ten Chinese miles, from Tiger's Mouth to Minde Road. The government and military welcomers included three thousand officers from the Sixth Military Officer Corps, over two thousand members of the Provincial Cadre Training Corps, over a thousand staff from the provincial government departments, and the rest were students and citizens from various schools. When the Chairman's car passed through this long welcoming crowd of ten Chinese miles, the cheers of "Long live the leader!" from the people shook the sky. The enthusiastic atmosphere and strict order were rarely seen by this reporter traveling in various provinces in the last decade. Seeing the love and respect of the Jiangxi compatriots for him, the Chairman, while in the car, felt deeply gratified that it remained the same as twenty years ago (it is said that in 1926, when the Chairman served as the Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Expeditionary Army and defeated the warlords in Jiangxi, he entered Nanchang barefoot wearing straw sandals and received a grand welcome from 300,000 citizens). However, when the Chairman noticed the ruins of houses and dilapidated walls in the suburbs through the car window, imagining the suffering of the Nanchang compatriots under the enemy's invasion, he couldn't help but sigh for a long time. He turned to Chairman Wang Lingji and said, "The people of Nanchang have suffered too much. We should quickly provide them with housing and conveniences and work together for reconstruction."</p>
<p>Grand Welcoming Meeting This Morning: The Chairman Decided to Attend and Give Instructions in Person.</p>
<p>The 21st was the first day of the Chairman's visit to Nanchang. A cool breeze blew in the morning, and the citizens, knowing that the Chairman would arrive, wore clean clothes and stood quietly on the streets, waiting happily. When the "Meiling" special plane landed at the new airport about five Chinese miles from Qingyunpu, the light rain had just cleared, and the rain clouds over the West Mountains, the high clouds over Nanpu, the rainbow hanging on the ground, and the afterglow of the sunset created an extremely beautiful scene. The citizens saw a rainbow suddenly rising from a corner of the airport and applauded and cheered, regarding it as an auspicious sign.</p>
<p>After Chairman Chiang arrived at the provincial government office, the leaders of all circles in Jiangxi province, knowing that the leader had worked hard along the way, waited for instructions to meet him. At about 6 PM, the Chairman invited Wang Lingji to have dinner together. The Xiangguang Theater Troupe, which had been scheduled to perform Peking opera, changed the performance to the evening of the 22nd. The grand welcoming meeting for the leader by all circles was scheduled to be held at the stadium at 7 AM on the 22nd, and Chairman Chiang decided to attend in person to deliver a speech to comfort and encourage the Jiangxi compatriots.</p>
<p>After attending the welcoming meeting of all circles in Nanchang on the 22nd, Chairman Chiang will go to Qingyunpu to pay respects at the Martyrs' Cemetery, and then to the Sixth Military Officer Corps to address the more than 7,000 demobilized officers. He also plans to visit the old site of the Nanchang Headquarters on the shore of East Lake and the destroyed library.</p>
<p>Dunkin and 24 other members of the UNRRA stationed in Jiangxi also went to the airport on the 21st to welcome the Chairman. They stood at the head of the welcoming line. They included nationals from six countries, including Britain, the United States, India, and Canada. They said that they felt very honored to see the demeanor of our leader in Nanchang.</p>
<p>Will Convene Military and Government Officials from All Circles to Discuss the Post-War Reconstruction Plan for Jiangxi Province.</p>
<p>Shen Changhuan, Secretary of the National Government, and 24 other members of the Chairman's entourage arrived in Nanchang at 12:00 PM on the 21st aboard aircraft 47-294. Shi Juemin, Military Advisor of the National Government, arrived in the province on the afternoon of the 21st in Chairman's Nash-style car number 17423. Before the "Meiling" special plane flew to Nanchang, Nanchang Airport sent a small trainer aircraft with a ten-foot-long red, white, and blue tricolor cloth tied to its tail, flying in the air as a signal. The welcoming crowds on the streets cheered and applauded upon seeing it. About ten minutes after the "Meiling" special plane carrying the Chairman landed, aircraft number 285, carrying Yu Jishi, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the National Government, also landed.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanchang Office, 21st] It is reported that before Chairman Chiang returns to Nanjing, he will convene the leaders of the Jiangxi party, government, and military from all circles and local elders to discuss the post-war reconstruction plan for Jiangxi Province. Chairman Chiang is deeply concerned about the general difficulties in restoring the rural areas in the disaster-stricken areas of Jiangxi Province. The Chairman will return to Nanjing in about one or two days.</p>
<h3>The Chairman Stayed in Lushan for Sixty-Nine Days: Before Leaving, He Visited the People to Inquire About Their Suffering; The Elders lined up to See Him Off, Reluctant to Part.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 21st] Chairman Chiang departed from the Guling office at 9:35 AM on the 21st to inspect Nanchang. Dozens of elders from Lushan, dressed in long gowns and mandarin jackets, lined up in front of the office to see him off. The Chairman immediately nodded to each of them to express his thanks and said, "I dare not trouble you. See you again next summer." He then took a sedan chair to Hanzhou Pass, Guanyin Bridge, Xiufeng Temple, and had lunch at Haihui Temple. He then turned from Haihui Temple to Jiujiang Xingzi Highway and back to Jiujiang. The Chairman visited the people along the way to inquire about their suffering and inspected the old residences of Guanyin Bridge and Xiufeng Temple. Guling Street was cleaned up on the 21st, and every household hung county flags and lanterns to show their farewell. The Chairman had been stationed on the mountain since July 14th, which was sixty-nine days until September 21st. The mountain people felt very close to him because they had seen him in person. Once they parted, they were all reluctant.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 21st] Before leaving Guling, the Chairman inspected Xiufeng Temple, paying tribute to the site of the fierce battle during the enemy's invasion of Jiujiang during the Anti-Japanese War. He then went to Haihui Temple for lunch. Haihui Temple was the location of the Lushan Training Corps before the war. From 1933 to 1937, the Chairman gathered military officers from all over the country to receive training there every summer, instilling national thought and improving their military skills, laying the foundation for the subsequent Anti-Japanese War. Before leaving Guling, the Chairman made a special trip to inspect it.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jiujiang, 21st] Chairman Chiang went down the mountain from the south road of Lushan, circumnavigated the Jiuxing Highway at the foot of the mountain, and arrived safely at the naval pier here at 4:15 PM. Military generals Zhang Ruigui and Liang Bo and representatives of the people lined up at the pier to see him off. The Chairman did not rest and immediately took a naval special boat to cross the river. At 5:00 PM, the special plane flew directly to Nanchang for inspection.</p>
<h3>Public Sale of Grain: Implementation Postponed.</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 21st] The public sale of grain in the Nanjing-Shanghai area, originally scheduled to begin next month, has been postponed due to insufficient preparation and various difficulties.</p>
<h3>American Personnel in the Military Mediation Department: Interest in Mediation Undiminished.</h3>
<p>Cai Wenzhi Speaks to Reporters</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Beiping Office, 21st] Today, when a reporter asked Cai Wenzhi, Chief of Staff of the Government in the Military Mediation Department, about the prospects for peace, Cai said that the fact that over two hundred and seventy family members of the American side had newly arrived in sixty-six units showed the American side's interest in mediation. According to what the reporter knows, they all agreed to the US government's requirement to have at least a one-year stay before coming to Beiping. The Communist Party's performance in the Military Mediation Department is passive, the number of staff is decreasing day by day, and yesterday another sixteen important personnel were sent back to Zhangjiakou. There are no increases in the number of teams in other places, and the teams in the war zone not only cannot mediate, but must also urgently seek to be transferred back, otherwise their lives will be in danger and they will be regarded as spies by the other side. Within the Military Mediation Department, issues such as violating the No. "Harmony" order are only discussed briefly.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Changchun Office, 20th] Wu Xingzhong, Major General and Director of the Government Mediation Office of the Changchun Forward Branch of the Military Mediation Department, and two staff members flew to Harbin this morning, and plan to transfer to Qiqihar, with an expected one-week visit.</p>
<h3>Nantong Team Will Return to Beiping.</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nantong Office, 21st] Colonel Qu Menhan, the American representative of the Beiping Military Mediation Department's Nantong Team, and four others, escaped from the Communist area a few days ago and returned to Nantong. All the items they carried were robbed and retained by the Communist army, and they were in a very embarrassing situation. They are currently staying at the Taizhihua Hotel, and have been sorting out everything in recent days. They will accompany Lieutenant Colonel Blankhurst to Beiping to report.</p>
<h3>Chifeng Executive Team Has Already Lost Its Freedom.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chaoyang, 21st] After witnessing the experience of the Chengde team, the Chifeng Second Executive Team felt uneasy. It was rumored that they had planned to retreat to Beiping, but because the Chifeng Airport was severely damaged, they planned to take a jeep to Chaoyang and then transfer to Beiping. Currently, the team is contacting both the Nationalists and the Communists to pass through. After Li Yunchang arrived in Chifeng, the American representatives of the team lost their freedom, and their safety is worrying. The American representatives of the team are Colonel McArthur and three others, the government representative is Lieutenant Colonel Liu Wuwei, the translator is Chen Zhengping, and the radio station director is Luo Wokai.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Will Be Adjusted Regularly: Methods Have Been Drafted and Are Being Submitted for Approval; Rumors of Another Devaluation Have Not Been Confirmed.</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 21st] Relevant parties here have not been able to confirm the rumors circulating in the Shanghai market that foreign exchange will be adjusted again. A certain authoritative person said that only one month has passed since the government announced the new exchange rate, and it seems impossible to devalue it again. The emergence of this rumor may be due to the fact that international banks need us to re-determine the value of the legal currency, and it is caused by the rumors of another devaluation of the US dollar and the French franc. It is also heard that relevant parties have drafted a method for adjusting foreign exchange, planning to make small adjustments on a regular basis, which is currently being submitted to the authorities for approval.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 21st] It is learned that the work of the Central Mint has now stopped. The Shanghai newspaper reported that the factory is preparing a plan to resume production in order to adapt to the future currency system reform, and has requested the Ministry of Finance to allocate tens of billions of funds, which is not reliable. The factory was severely damaged by the enemy and puppets, and it is possible to request the allocation of funds for repair. The unification of the old currency system reform is indeed something that must be done in the future, but it is too early to talk about it at present, and it will take a considerable period of time after the political situation is stabilized before we can talk about reform.</p>
<h3>The National Army in Fengzhen and Datong Joined Forces; The Communist Army's Dependents in Zhangyuan Fled in Droves; The National Army in Jining Is Advancing Towards Shangdu.</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Gui Sui Office, 21st] The troops of Ma Zhanshan in the Twelfth War Zone attacked from Datong yesterday and advanced to Gushan last night. This afternoon, they joined forces with the troops attacking from Fengzhen in Baoziwan. It is said that the commander who rescued Datong is General Sun Lanfeng, who was the first to take over Datong last year.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Beiping Office, 21st] According to official sources, the National Army in eastern Sui and the garrison in Datong joined forces at noon on the 20th between Fengzhen and Liuyi. From then on, the main road between Gui Sui and Datong has been completely opened. The Gui Sui and Jining roads are now open to traffic, and the work of repairing the road between Jining and Datong is being stepped up and will be open to military traffic in the short term. The Communist army suffered heavy casualties in the Battle of Jining, and Zhang Bai, deputy commander of Yao Zhe, was also killed in battle. He Long's troops have now withdrawn from Zuoyun and Youyu in northwestern Shanxi, and Nie Rongzhen and Xiao Ke have withdrawn to Zhangjiakou. Although the first team originally stationed in Jining has returned to Beiping safely, it is said that the representative of the chief officer, Zhou Beifeng (Director of the Sui Land Political Affairs Bureau), is still missing. It was rumored last month that Zhou was sent to Jining and Fengzhen to persuade He Long to lift the siege of Datong, but to no avail, and the Jining battle broke out. The Jicha Jin Daily in Zhangjiakou compared Zhou to Lai Chi, and Zhou's safety is quite questionable.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Tianjin Office, 21st] After the Communist army in Datong set fire in the suburbs, they collapsed to Zhangyuan. There are already three or four thousand Communist army dependents in Zhangyuan, supporting the old and carrying the young, fleeing to Kelan via Wutai.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Beiping Office, 21st] The Qinglong area is still calm today. However, two highway bridges between Beiping North and Changping were destroyed by the Communist army, and the National Army has dispatched troops to repair them. According to official intelligence, the 120th Division Headquarters of the Communist Army is currently stationed in Kangzhuang, two brigades and three regiments of the Communist Army are stationed in Huailai, and one regiment of the Communist Army is stationed in Yanqing. Both sides are still in the process of mobilization, and there may not be any battles in the next one or two days.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Beiping Office, 21st] News of the National Army advancing towards Zhangjiakou still cannot obtain concrete proof from a powerful source. When inquiring about the relevant parties, they are all evasive and reply that Chief Chen strictly ordered not to casually reveal military information when he came to Beiping, but said that it is okay to publish it when there are results. It is rumored that Zhu De is indeed sitting in Zhangyuan. The government side of the Military Mediation Department said that the government and American representatives of the Zhangjiakou team are being monitored by the Communist army, and the American radio station is also prohibited from using. Whether the team can be retrieved is still a question. Another person familiar with the military geography of Chahar and Sui said that there are three routes for the National Army in eastern Sui to attack Zhangjiakou: one is from Fengzhen via Zenyongkou Yanggao Chaigoubao, one is from Fengzhen via Longshengzhuang Chaigoubao, and one is from Jining via Shangdu Shangyi Zhangbei. The first Qian is the most convenient of these three routes. It is reported that the National Army that recovered Jining has divided its troops into one route and is advancing towards Shangdu. The progress of the advance is unknown.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 21st] The government army launched an offensive against Zhangjiakou today and advanced to Nankou, two hundred miles northwest of Beiping. However, this news has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 21st] After senior official sources close to the government confirmed that Zhangjiakou and Harbin have become the main targets of the National Army's offensive, qualified parties here believe that the situation in China and the position of the American mediator will undergo drastic developments in the near future, which may cause serious reactions to the China policy of the United States and the Soviet Union.

<h3>Madame Chiang Arrives in Shanghai from Guling: Mrs. Marshall and Soong Tzu-liang Came Along.</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Office] Madame Chiang and Mrs. Marshall took a plane from Guling to Nanjing at 1:00 PM yesterday. After a short rest in Nanjing, they flew to Shanghai in the original plane at about 5:00 PM. At that time, the autumn rain was tight and the journey was inconvenient. After Mrs. Chiang and others arrived in Shanghai, it was difficult to find the airport due to poor visibility. They circled over the city for several weeks and safely landed at Longhua Airport at 6:40 PM. Those who came to welcome them were Mayor Wu and his wife, Huang Renlin who had just arrived in Shanghai from Beiping, Group Leader Yan Hugu of the police department, and Colonel Charles, the American military representative. Soong Tzu-liang, General Manager of the China Construction Corporation, and Zhang Yongliang, the adjutant of Madame Chiang, came to Shanghai on the same plane as the two ladies.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] After spending the hot summer in Lushan, the summer resort of China, Madame Chiang and Mrs. Marshall flew to Shanghai on Marshall's special plane No. 476650 last night. Those who came to the airport to welcome them helped the two ladies off the plane and said frequently: "Be careful, ladies." It is said that they will come here for a five or six-day stay and have no special mission. After the two ladies got into the car, they nodded and smiled to greet those who came to welcome them, and then drove to Chiang's residence on Dongping Road to rest.</p>

<h3>The National Army in Hebei and China Advances: Baigou Town Was Recovered Yesterday.</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Beiping Office, 21st] Baoding Telephone: (1) The National Army advancing towards Xiongxian has defeated the main force of the Communist Army, and recovered the important stronghold of Baigou Town last night. The county government will be set up in the town to control the entire county. The National Army has now advanced twenty Chinese miles across the Baigou River. (2) The National Army advancing southwest of Baoding recovered four strongholds, including Dongxi Linshui, last night. Two new field regiments of the Communist Army were transferred to support, and they are fighting fiercely. (3) The Communist Army along the Pinghan Road is preparing to destroy the railway in a big way. Last night, the Yujiazhuang and Xushui railway stations were attacked by the Communist Army, and they retreated after a three-hour fierce battle. At the same time, Dingxing Xincheng was also attacked last night. More than 10,000 Communist Army troops arrived near Gaopaidian Railway Station last night, and there was an attempt to attack the station.</p>
<h3>Millions of Japanese Troops in the Northeast: Mysteriously Disappeared.</h3>
<p>American Congressman Demands Explanation from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st] Representatives Hillis and Sikes, members of the US House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, recently demanded that the Soviet Union be forced to explain the mysterious disappearance of one million Japanese troops in the Northeast.</p>
<h3>Marshalls Meet Yesterday: The Political Situation Is Developing.</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 21st] Amid the military progress, peace talks are still ongoing, especially with the Marshalls still making various final efforts with active confidence. On the 21st, Special Envoy Marshall visited Ambassador Stuart at 11:00 AM, and left after talking for half an hour. At that time, Pi Zonggan, military attache of the National Government, also came to visit. After Marshall left, Pi met with Stuart and Fu Jingbo again, and left shortly after. According to people around Stuart, the situation is developing. When reporters asked whether it was a good development, they replied that the content of the conversation could not be announced at present, but the development should be hopeful.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 21st] It has been learned that the Communist Party's dispute over the three-person and five-person meetings has faded, but its goal remains unchanged, that is, an immediate ceasefire must be achieved. As for the rumors that the content of the five-member group's discussions can be expanded, the Communist Party still firmly rejects it, because the Communist Party wants to talk about a ceasefire first, and the government wants to talk about other things after the topic of reorganizing the National Government Committee is settled. Therefore, the Communist Party will not participate. However, based on the premise of a ceasefire, the Communist Party believes that the military three-person group meeting must be convened. The content of Wang Bingnan's visit to Ambassador Stuart today is circling around this point.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 21st] A reporter learned from an authoritative source that Special Envoy Marshall handed over a document containing opinions to Wang Bingnan on the 20th for delivery to the Communist Party. The content is still unknown. According to a certain person, these two days will be a turning point for the overall situation, depending on the Communist Party's reply. The reporter then tried to obtain confirmation from the US Embassy and the Communist Party Office, but both denied it, believing that this was not the case.</p>
<h3>Liang Shuming Arrived in Nanjing Yesterday.</h3>
<p>Carrying a Letter from Zhang Junmai to Marshall</p>
<p>Main Opinions Are the Same as the Communist Party.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 21st] Liang Shuming, Secretary-General of the China Democratic League, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 21st. Liang brought a letter from Zhang Junmai to Special Envoy Marshall, the content of which explained that the current situation should still focus on a ceasefire. His main opinions coincided with the Communist Party. Zhang Shenfu left Nanjing by plane for Beiping this morning.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Communist Party Is Standing at a Crossroads: Should Decide on a Political Line; It Is Said That Fu Zuoyi's Telegram to Mao Zedong Was Full of Sincerity.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Because General Fu Zuoyi sent a telegram to Mao Zedong, requesting him to abandon force and join the government, a Central News Agency reporter visited Minister Peng Xuepei of the Propaganda Department to inquire about his opinions. Minister Peng replied that General Fu's telegram was full of sincerity, and he could not agree more. In recent days, the National Army has been progressing smoothly everywhere. The government is very pleased with the loyal and brave soldiers, but at the same time, it is even more saddened by the loss of life of the majority of the people who have been driven by the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese Communist Party is now standing at a historical crossroads and should deeply consider and decide on its future political line: whether to continue to sacrifice countless lives to try to seize power by force, or to follow Chairman Chiang's repeated advice, abandon force and follow the path of democratic constitutionalism in order to engage in political struggle? If the former is chosen, the people will suffer prolonged bloodshed, create chaos and poverty, and the Communist Party itself will be tormented by conscience; if the latter is chosen, the Communist Party will be the second largest party in China, a strong enemy or friend of the Kuomintang, either winning the support of the people through political means, or participating in the government to contribute to the restoration of the country. The advantages and disadvantages are very obvious. It is meaningless to consider the issue of face due to military victory or defeat. During the War of Resistance, millions of people contributed their lives to the country. What is the Communist Party reluctant to give up in contributing some important transportation points to the country? As for Mr. Zhou Enlai's statement that the Communist Party will never surrender to the Kuomintang, it is even more unexpected. The Kuomintang will never harbor the fallacious idea of victory or surrender. On the contrary, Chairman Chiang has always sincerely asked the Communist Party to participate in the government and the National Assembly. If a political party abandons the policy of rebellion and engages in the struggle of constitutionalism, it is a noble and patriotic act, not surrender. I believe that General Fu's telegram is in complete agreement with Chairman Chiang's August 14th manifesto.</p>
<h3>Telegram from Fu Zuoyi to Mao Zedong</h3>
<p>(Continued from Yesterday) Internal strife is unanimously hated by the people. How can you, the initiators of the strife, stand among the people? There is only one correct path. In the constitutional system, the Communist Party has a future, but armed rebellion and separate division will surely be destroyed. Please think carefully: When the victory came at the beginning of last year, how many people sympathized with you for proposing democracy? After a year of factual proof, so-called democracy and peace are just your propaganda, and war and division are your true actions. How many people at home and abroad sympathize with you today? This is a very obvious test of your policies. A leader who claims to be a revolutionary should know that the so-called revolutionary situation is objective and real, not subjectively forced, otherwise</p>
<p>Cutting One's Feet to Fit the Shoes</p>
<p>To impose on the people what the people hate will never succeed. Therefore, I sincerely hope that you can accept the bloody lesson, immediately change your policies, abandon the idea of the omnipotence of force, quickly join the government, end the internal strife, and let the people of the whole country work hard to build our country. I have never been hostile to the Communist Party, and I have no intention of fighting the Communist army. My mother is a person who sympathizes with the Communist Party. You once firmly advocated the War of Resistance, and I admire your spirit of firm struggle. Only today's policy of war is extremely wrong. For the sake of the country and the people, I ask Mr. to immediately abandon this policy, promote the realization of constitutionalism, nationalize the army, and democratize politics, so as to work together harmoniously. As long as Mr. Mao participates in the government and recommends Mr. He Neng or any of you to succeed me in my current position as a member of the government, I will not only be the first to welcome him, but also be willing to do my best to make it happen. If you don't mind, I myself am willing to be a low-level staff member under Mr. Mao and absolutely faithfully obey you. Such a peaceful, unified and democratic China is what the people of the whole country demand, what the United States and the Soviet Union jointly hope for, and what all countries in the world sympathize with. We must maintain close cooperation with the United States and maintain close relations with the Soviet Union forever. The relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union and world peace can be guaranteed. With a single thought, Mr. not only can China achieve peace, but also humanity will benefit. Success or failure, good or bad, now is the best opportunity for you to choose. Fu Zuoyi, You, Hao, Kou. (End)</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan 21st Dispatch] The government has reported that the Shandong Communist army is still actively concentrating supplies from all parts of the province to the mountainous areas of southern Shandong. All supplies in the plains of western Shandong have been transported to Sangcun and Fengmao Village east of Teng County, and the Tianbao Mountain area of Fei County in recent days. The conscription of able-bodied men is being carried out urgently. 6,000 people have been drafted from each of Gu County, Qingping, and Boping in northwestern Shandong, and 10,000 from Tangyi. The public is extremely panicked and has organized self-defense groups for self-protection.

The National Army entering Jinxiang in western Shandong has advanced north and reached the southwestern part of Jiaxiang County. Jiaxiang is expected to be recovered within days. Li Jiande's People's Self-Defense Army of over a thousand people in Wulibao, west of Jiaxiang City, engaged in a fierce battle with the Communist army for a day and night, defeating the Communist army and seizing over five hundred guns. The Communist army in southern Shandong has hollowed out each hole of the Jinpu Railway's large iron bridge south of the boundary, installed explosives, and seems to be preparing to destroy transportation and abandon the railway.</p>

<h3>Legend of Jingfang's Talk to Reporters: The Strategy for Suppressing Bandits in the Taihu Lake Area Emphasizes Appeasement and Giving Bandits a Chance to Turn Over a New Leaf</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou 21st Dispatch] Major General Fu Jingfang, the commander of the bandit suppression in the Taihu Lake area, met with reporters alone today and said: The bandit suppression work is currently being actively prepared. The headquarters will be temporarily set up in Mudu Town, which belongs to the county, starting on the 22nd. Once the work has made progress, it will move to the Dongshan area. The jurisdiction covers nine counties, including Suzhou, Wuxi, Wujiang, Wujin, Yixing, Wuxing, Changxing, Guangde, and Xuancheng, spanning the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. However, the strength of the bandits is not as great as rumored. According to a confirmed investigation, the total number is no more than a thousand people. Among them, apart from a part of the New Fourth Army, very few are willing to be bandits. Most are scattered soldiers and vagrants who are forced to take risks due to their livelihood. The current government is broad-minded in everything. The government has also followed its original intention in dealing with the bandit suppression in Taihu Lake, and has instructed me to use virtue to influence people and emphasize appeasement. Therefore, the strategy for suppressing bandits is to eliminate the stubborn bandits who refuse to reform, but to give those who can repent a chance to turn over a new leaf, and allow them to choose whether to serve or return to farming, according to their wishes. The recent plan is to go to the counties under its jurisdiction in the next two or three days to inspect, exchange views with local authorities, determine the overall plan, and convene a security conference for the bandit suppression area in Suzhou on the 25th, attended by the county magistrates and military section chiefs of the five counties of Su, Xi, Wu, Wu, and Yi. As for the four counties of Wuxing and Changxing, due to the long distance, it is planned to hold a separate meeting in Wuxing. The bandit suppression period is scheduled to be completed by the end of October. For the sake of a permanent solution, it is decided to dispatch all local teams in the jurisdiction to launch operations in different areas at the same time. If necessary, mobile forces and regular troops will be requested to participate, so as to gradually tighten the encirclement and ensure that the bandits disappear and that security is maintained forever. We are truly determined to do this.</p>

<h3>Two Steamships Robbed Between Songjiang and Qingpu; Gunfire Erupts Between Robbers and Self-Defense Force; Six Passengers Unfortunate Die or Are Injured</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Songjiang Correspondent] The steamships Fuxing and Limin operate between Su, Kun, Qing, and Song, and business is quite good.

Afterwards, the bandits drove the passengers on the ship ashore and ordered the driver to sail the ship to Dianshan Lake, waiting for the Fuxing to sail from Tongli, intending to rob it again. Unexpectedly, there were several members of the self-defense force on the ship, who set up machine guns. The bandits suspected that they were government troops and opened fire. Six passengers were killed or injured. The self-defense force immediately returned fire, wounding one bandit. Seeing that the situation was not good, the bandits shouted and fled.</p>
<h3>UNRRA to Transport Railway Equipment to North China; Decides to Move and Repair Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Nanxun Railways</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nan　 Correspondent] The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway starts from Hangzhou in the east, traverses Jiangxi through Jiangshan, and extends to Zhuzhou in Hunan, connecting with the Yuehan Railway, with a total length of 1008 kilometers. During the War of Resistance, more than 80% of the entire line was destroyed. This time, due to the difficulty in obtaining track and other equipment for transportation and restoration, all sections except those ordered will be repaired by Zhu Nengxing. According to a message from the Jiangxi Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, Director Cai went to Shanghai to participate in the UNRRA meeting. Because the locomotives and tracks transported by UNRRA to Shanghai for use on various roads in North China could not be transported due to obstruction by the Communist army, he specially requested UNRRA to allocate this equipment to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Nanxun Railways so that they could be quickly repaired. UNRRA and the Ministry of Communications both strongly agreed, and all preparations are currently underway. The Nanxun Railway has a total length of 122 kilometers, and is managed by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway as a branch line. Because this road is the throat connecting Jiangxi to the Yangtze River, its importance is critical. Construction is currently underway in four sections, and it is expected to be open to traffic next spring. A large iron bridge will be built to cross the Gan River and connect with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, parallel to the Zhongzheng Bridge. The location will be between Lizhishe Niuhang or Chao Wangzhou, and is currently under investigation.</p>

He also said that UNRRA is in negotiations with the Ministry of Communications on highway transportation cooperation, but no final decision has been made. Regarding the cooperation between UNRRA and companies such as China Merchants Bureau, it is also limited to providing ships for the companies to transport UNRRA materials, but the ships still belong to UNRRA.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Final Stage of Reviewing the Municipal Budget</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council discussed the budget for the second half of this year yesterday afternoon, and the debate was extremely heated. It can be said that the conference has entered the most intense and important stage. Although the budget has not been approved due to the fact that the figures for some income and expenditure items are still awaiting the review reports of other groups for reference and discussion, judging from the budget review report submitted yesterday, it can be said that there will not be much change in the future. We would like to briefly state our feelings based on the reports of our reporters at the scene yesterday and the resolutions that have already been passed.</p>
<p>First of all, we believe that the spirit of the Municipal Council in reviewing and even discussing the budget is worthy of the support of the citizens. The review principles stated in the review report are: "For the revenue budget, those that are considered to be underestimated should be appropriately increased, and those that are improperly collected should be eliminated; for the expenditure budget, those that are considered to be administrative expenses should be appropriately reduced, and those that are considered to be business expenses should be listed in full." We believe that this is absolutely accurate. In particular, we believe that the Municipal Government has an unshirkable responsibility to diligently supervise and collect, rectify tax collection, eliminate embezzlement, and prevent fraud, so that tax revenue can be increased without increasing tax rates. We know that there are many donations and taxes now, and what the citizens pay is more than this number, and half of it goes into private pockets. Assuming that every drop can be returned to the public, it will definitely exceed the figures listed in the original budget. Therefore, the Municipal Government should do its best to rectify old taxes and increase revenue under the condition of not increasing new taxes. It must not intentionally underestimate income and form a deceptive situation. If it is truly used properly, and the income is insufficient, then it can be responsible for opening up new tax sources. As for expenditure, it should be used where it should be used, and saved where it should be saved. "Not a penny should fall into empty space" should be the principle followed by those who manage public expenditures. In particular, since the Municipal Council has expressed its full acceptance of the construction business expenses, the Municipal Government should do its best to streamline staff and administration and reduce its administrative expenses as much as possible, so as to alleviate the burden on the citizens, which should always be kept in mind by the Municipal Government.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Municipal Council's style of seeking truth from facts during discussions is also very commendable. They believe that the names of revenue donations and taxes are inappropriate or the season has passed, such as the collection of defense corps uniform fees and epidemic prevention fees from the housing donation, and they resolutely eliminated them, and would rather use other methods to make up for the shortfall. They believe that the collection of donations and taxes from citizens must be justified so that everyone can see at a glance what the taxes are used for. Now that the defense corps has been abolished early, and the summer epidemic prevention has also passed, what would be the citizens' impressions if they continue to be levied permanently under the housing donation? Of course, we know that after this elimination, the Municipal Government will receive seventeen or eight hundred million yuan less, and the citizens will still have to bear the responsibility of making up for it, but we agree with the Municipal Council's view that it is better to open up new tax sources so that we can understand what this new tax is used for.</p>
<p>Finally, we absolutely agree with the Municipal Council's attitude of not being overly demanding or letting go of the Municipal Government. The Council is preparing to reduce the original expenditure listed by the Municipal Government by more than 10.7 billion yuan. In addition to the proposed new expenditure and the eliminated income, the shortfall must be in the range of 23 billion yuan, which is 10 billion yuan less than the 33.3 billion yuan shortfall in the original plan of the cloth government. The Council's resolution authorizes the Municipal Government to investigate this reduced amount, and, on the principle of not reducing business expenses, make overall plans, consider the complexity of affairs, the number of redundant personnel, and do its best to reduce expenses in order to be suitable, without making rigid and binding regulations. We believe that this is very appropriate. This is the style of not being overly demanding. At the same time, the Council instructs the Municipal Government to recompile the budget within the scope of this resolution and send it to the Council for review in the shortest possible time, so as to serve as a guideline for future review and final accounts. In particular, the deadline for submitting the budget for the next fiscal year (the 36th year) is the end of November this year, which shows that it will never let go of its supervision of the Municipal Government's revenue and expenditure. The British often boast that their representative system first grasped the government's "power of the purse." In the initial stage of the Municipal Council's implementation of democratic politics in Shanghai, if it can adhere to this policy and continue to make progress, it can be said that it has found the pearl in the deep sea and is not far from the topic.</p>
<p>However, the budget of the Shanghai Municipal Government for the second half of this year is already behind schedule at this time of discussion, and it is only a test demonstration. How much is the total budget, and how to make up for it, and what new taxes to adopt, we still have to wait and see the Municipal Council's resolution tomorrow. We hope that the councilors will carefully and conscientiously fulfill their responsibilities.</p>
<h3>Important Resolutions of the Municipal Council Yesterday: Relief for Out-of-School Children, Increase Education Funding, Abolish Branch Agencies and Surcharges on Housing Damage Fees, Urge Acceleration of Land Value Tax Collection</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] How much revenue should the municipal government actually receive in the second half of this year? How much should it spend? How much will be deficient? And how will the deficient amount be made up? This important proposal, closely watched by four million citizens, unfolded in one of the most heated and brilliant debates at yesterday afternoon's general meeting. Although, due to time constraints, the specific figures and solutions for making up the deficit are still to be decided next Monday, several important principles have been successfully passed: (1) Education funding should be increased to at least 20% of the total budget, with particular emphasis on the universalization of national education. (2) The collection of land value tax should be actively promoted by the municipal government's Land Bureau, according to the teachings of the National Father, and must be completed within this year. (3) The defense corps uniform fees and summer epidemic prevention expenses attached to the housing damage fees should be immediately abolished. (4) The Housing Lease Management Committee is no longer necessary and should be abolished. (5) The Police Bureau's mobile patrol team should be abolished. (6) Allowances for councilors' transportation expenses should still be included, but those who voluntarily waive them should return them to the municipal treasury.</p>
<p>The original budget prepared by the municipal government showed a deficit of over 33.3 billion yuan. After careful review by the Ninth Subcommittee, additions were made where appropriate, and subtractions were made where appropriate. As a result, the deficit was reduced to over 20.3 billion yuan. The detailed figures submitted to the general meeting for discussion are shown in the following table: 1. Original Total Revenue Budget: 51,390,363,015 yuan</p>
<p>Add: Proposed Increase in Revenue Budget: 3,756,100,000 yuan</p>
<p>Total: 55,146,463,015 yuan 2. Original Total Expenditure Budget: 84,717,521,800 yuan</p>
<p>Less: (A) Proposed Discretionary Reductions in Budgeted Amounts: 2,395,361,050 yuan</p>
<p>(B) Purchase and Repair Costs Reduced by 30% of Original Budget: 506,364,000 yuan</p>
<p>(C) General Administrative Expenses Reduced by 15% of Original Budget: 7,875,901,494 yuan</p>
<p>Add: Proposed New Expenditure Budget: 1,556,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>Total: 75,495,895,256 yuan 3. Revenue-Expenditure Deficit: 20,349,432,241 yuan</p>
<p>Xu Yongzuo Reports on Review Results and Explains Additions and Subtractions in Detail</p>
<p>Xu Yongzuo, the accountant and convener of the Ninth Subcommittee, not only reported on the committee's review process but also explained the above figures in detail. The proposed increases in revenue were based on the actual collection of existing tax sources in the first half of the year, with appropriate adjustments. Specifically, license plate tax revenue was increased by one-fold compared to the original budget, banquet and entertainment tax revenue increased by 10%, new vehicle registration fee revenue increased by 50%, slaughter tax revenue increased by one-fold, sanitation revenue increased by 20%, public utility company compensation increased by 10%, and tuition and teacher appreciation fees were reduced by the teacher appreciation fee portion. On the expenditure side, the recurring departments eliminated were (1) Housing Lease Management Committee expenses and (2) Police Bureau mounted patrol expenses. Reductions were made in subsidies and assistance expenditures. Temporary departments reduced were (1) Municipal Council meeting expenses, (2) Municipal Government Secretariat gazette printing and advertising costs, (3) Housing Lease Management Committee purchase and repair costs, (4) Education Bureau vehicle fuel costs, (5) private school and agency subsidies, and (6) Public Utilities Bureau electrical equipment costs. Eliminated was the establishment cost of the Municipal Civilian Hospital.</p>
<p>Xu particularly pointed out that this budget, both in its preparation and review, felt rough due to time constraints. However, the council's review of the budget differs from that of accounting or auditing agencies, as it can only focus on the big picture and make general increases or decreases. It should not be too rigid to avoid difficulties in implementation.</p>
<p>After the report, the general meeting began to discuss the review results. During the discussion, Speaker Pan summarized the opinions of the councilors, harshly criticized the current tax system and certain unreasonable administrative practices, and, amidst the most enthusiastic applause in the entire venue, passed several important decisions.</p>
<p>Discussion of Education Funding</p>
<p>The first issue raised was education funding. According to the draft constitution, education funding should account for at least 30% of local total expenditure. However, after the review committee's reductions, it accounts for only 19% of the total budget, which is insufficient. Zhou Feicheng was the first to appeal to the general meeting, pointing out the importance of education in China today and arguing that education funding should have an independent nature and should be increased to at least 20% of the total budget. Jiang Jizhou, Sun Zhenchun, Cen Zhiliang, and others also added their opinions, especially highlighting the large number of children out of school today and emphasizing the urgent need to establish more national schools. How can funding be reduced?</p>
<p>Speaker Issues Conclusion</p>
<p>The speaker gave a clear conclusion to this issue, saying: "Education is certainly the most important. The current percentage of education funding is too low. We propose that the municipal government revise the budget to increase education funding to at least 20% of the total budget, making overall adjustments from various expenses. Special attention should be paid to the universalization of national education, and the Education Bureau should focus on national education. When so many children today still do not have the opportunity to study, many unnecessary and non-urgent things should not be done. For example, drama schools and the like can be closed down. We must first solve the problem of children out of school. We have no spare money to run ornaments!" His proposal was unanimously passed amidst enthusiastic applause.</p>
<p>Outdated Police Facilities: Mounted Patrol Team Decided to Abolish, Defense Corps Uniform Fees and Epidemic Prevention Expenses Simultaneously Voted to Abolish</p>
<p>The defense corps uniform fees and epidemic prevention expenses attached to the housing damage fees were still included in this budget. During the discussion, Shen Ding proposed their cancellation, arguing that since there is already a revenue-expenditure deficit and new sources of revenue must be found, all such nominal or outdated taxes should be abolished. The vote resulted in a majority in favor of cancellation, thereby reducing revenue by 1.8 billion yuan, which will be added to the deficit for separate planning.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the Police Bureau's mounted patrol team, Director Xuan sent a letter to the council yesterday, briefly stating that the city of Shanghai has a vast area and rugged roads, and the mounted patrol team's suppression effect is the most significant. He requested that the team be maintained for the sake of public order. During the discussion, some argued that the mounted patrol team is an outdated police facility, while others pointed out that the Police Bureau only established the mounted patrol team because it had received a batch of enemy-property horses. In fact, Shanghai does not need such a mounted team. Some advocated for its retention but proposed that it be stationed in the suburbs. The vote resulted in only fourteen votes in favor of retention, and the resolution was to abolish it.</p>
<p>The last interesting discussion was about the councilors' own transportation expenses. When it was first proposed, many councilors said they did not want to take this fee and wanted to remove it from the budget. Suddenly, Deputy Speaker Xu Lao spoke, saying: "Although we do not actually care about this transportation fee, since there is a regulation, we do not need to be polite." Fei Shusheng believed that this issue should not be discussed or voted on at all. This is a regulation of the council's organization and the rights that councilors should enjoy. Unless they are willing to waive it themselves, even if the entire body passes a resolution not to include this fee in the budget, he personally will still take it from the municipal government.</p>
<p>The case was therefore no longer discussed, and if there are volunteers to waive it, the council will return it to the municipal treasury.</p>
<p>Suggestions Made on Municipal Government Budget in Three Points</p>
<p>Before discussing the specific budget figures, the speaker temporarily put forward several important suggestions:</p>
<p>(1) The council's reduction of budget expenditure is only a decision on the total amount. As for how to weigh the distribution, the municipal government should plan comprehensively, consider the complexity of affairs, the number of personnel, break away from favoritism, and independently decide on measures to reduce staff and simplify administration.</p>
<p>(2) After this budget is approved by the council, the municipal government should revise the budget in the shortest possible time based on the resolution for verification.</p>
<p>(3) The budget for the 36th year [of the Republic] should be sent to the council together with reference materials before the end of November of this year, and it should be submitted for discussion at the second general meeting to avoid temporary constraints and inadequate review.</p>
<p>These three suggestions were unanimously passed.</p>
<p>Two Temporary Motions</p>
<p>At the council meeting yesterday morning, the temporary motion proposed by councilors Feng Youzhen and others was discussed: "As winter is approaching, it is proposed to consult with the municipal government to quickly issue a temporary relief fund of 105,567,000 yuan to purchase winter clothing for children in distress in a timely manner. Is this appropriate? Please put it to a vote." Because the Caohejing children's shelter houses 1,700 children in distress, expenses are enormous, and funding is urgently needed. The general meeting passed a resolution: "Please allocate funds from the municipal government within the scope of the budget to purchase as a priority."</p>
<p>Another temporary motion was proposed by Zhang Zhongyuan and others: "Suggest that the Ministry of Economic Affairs, regarding the factories taken over from enemy puppets, should change their brand names and decorations if they continue to produce products in order to correct public perception." The speaker said: "The Ministry of Economic Affairs has taken over many factories with many products. Please consider this carefully." Some councilors believed that changing the brand names of all enemy puppet factories taken over might be inconvenient. Li Wenjie said: "For example, the Indanthrene produced by De Fu Yanghang has been widely adopted by society. If it is also changed, it will be quite obstructive." As a result, the general meeting decided to withdraw the case.</p>
<p>Failure to Collect Land Value Tax: Councilors Rise Up to Criticize, Special Effort Should Be Made to Supervise the Collection of Old Taxes as a Way to Increase Revenue, and the Embezzlement and Corruption of Tax Collectors Must Be Eradicated</p>
<p>Why the collection of land value tax still cannot be actively carried out has been the most intense criticism from the councilors. Zhu Ping, the director of the Land Bureau, was again asked to come on stage to explain, saying: "The collection of land value tax must first require the completion of land registration. Because Shanghai was a concession in the past, the situation is more complicated, and it can only be handled district by district. This spring, the Land Administration of the Ministry of Finance sent people to discuss a plan with the municipal government and approved funding of 3 billion yuan, which is expected to be completed in the second half of the year. However, this funding has not been received until now, and the municipal government only raises more than 10 million yuan per month to cope, so it cannot be completed quickly. It is hoped that after this budget is approved, a portion can be collected within this year."</p>
<p>Qu Yue walked onto the podium to express his opinion. He believed that they cannot always wait. A transitional method can be set to collect taxes on land that has not been surveyed. The speaker at this time again gave a pertinent and insightful speech, saying: "In addition to opening up new taxes, we should strive to supervise the collection of old taxes as a way to increase revenue. Under the principle of not increasing the tax rate, we can increase revenue. The budgeted income listed now is not necessarily reliable. Many of them may enter the pockets of tax collectors. This situation of embezzlement and corruption must be effectively eliminated. As for land tax, there are clear provisions in the National Father's teachings. Now we should first set a transitional method to collect it." Therefore, he suggested that "The municipal government should order the competent authorities to work hard to supervise the collection of all principled taxes, eradicate embezzlement and corruption, and especially collect land value tax as soon as possible to increase revenue."</p>
<p>Zhan Wenbian added to the speaker's opinion. He felt that under the current unreasonable tax situation, the real burden is borne by the common people. People with real estate may not be unwilling to bear it. The blame lies with the government's incompetence! Therefore, he wanted the Land Bureau to take responsibility and show its ability to sort out the situation in these six months no matter what.</p>
<p>Gu Jinzao believed that the method of household registration is cumbersome and time-consuming and should be improved. Jiang Pingfan advocated that the Land Bureau should immediately handle it according to the bidding method in the National Father's teachings. Xu Yongzuo believed that the bidding procedure would probably take a year and a half to complete, and a transitional method should be set first to truly achieve the goal of immediately increasing tax revenue.</p>
<p>Finally, summarizing everyone's opinions, the principle was passed to suggest that the municipal government order the Land Bureau to actively promote the collection of land value tax, which must be completed within this year.</p>
<p>Special Cash Guarantee: Recommend Adoption by the Central Government</p>
<p>Regarding proposal No. 9 in the gold series, which recommends the adoption of a special cash guarantee system, after being submitted to the Fourth and Tenth Groups for review, it was slightly revised, and Article 3 of the original rules was abolished. The review opinion was to recommend the adoption of the special cash guarantee system by the central government, and the original proposed plan was submitted to the central government for reference. The general meeting resolved to adopt the review opinion.</p>
<p>Widespread Establishment of Dental Treatment Institutions, Establishment of Free Artificial Beds</p>
<p>The Municipal Council held its 19th meeting yesterday morning and continued to discuss proposals related to health and society. Most of them were passed smoothly.</p>
<p>Regarding the health proposals, No. 7: "Please ask the municipal government to establish dental treatment institutions to improve the health of citizens." The determined method is: "Each municipal hospital should also set up a dental department: First, to provide general treatment for those with dental diseases. Second, to assist in the auxiliary diagnosis and treatment of diseases related to various departments." Passed the resolution. No. 8 "Please ask the municipal government to instruct the city police bureau to protect the physical freedom of medical technicians." Passed without objection. No. 9: "Please ask the municipal government to set up free hospital beds for industrial workers to improve worker health." Delete the words "industrial" in the title and pass. No. 10: "Compulsory vaccination against smallpox", passed without objection.</p>
<p>Promote Labor-Management Cooperation, Develop National Industry</p>
<p>Regarding proposals on social relief and labor, the 7th Review Subcommittee summarized them as the 12th case, of which Social Affairs Proposal No. 2: "Promote labor-management cooperation and develop the national industry" was amended and passed by the general meeting. The decided methods include running labor-management cooperative factories, fairly handling labor-management disputes, and implementing factory meetings.</p>
<p>Social Affairs Proposal No. 3 is "Improve the distribution system and suppress prices." The review opinion is "It is proposed that the general meeting pass it and send it to the municipal government for implementation." Mayor Wu asked the speaker to allow him to explain this point, briefly stating: "I absolutely agree with the distribution system, but the current difficulty is that the government authorities cannot fully control transportation, and the city government's materials are not enough for universal distribution. For example, for food rice, merchants are now freely transporting and selling on the one hand, and the city government has a large amount of food rice that can be sold at any time to suppress rice prices on the other hand. If all is distributed by the city government, there may be a risk of panic at present. Please consider carefully." Feng Youzhen proposed that it be sent to the municipal government for deliberation and implementation, and the resolution was passed.</p>
<p>Add Public Pawnshops, Reduce Interest Rates</p>
<p>Social Affairs No. 4, the reason for the case is "Because the monthly interest rate of the pawn industry is huge and the term is short, it is proposed that the municipal authorities re-stipulate and order compliance to help the poor and stabilize society." After discussion by the councilors, it was believed that the interest rate should be reduced as much as possible and stipulated by the Social Affairs Bureau. If there are practical difficulties, the municipal government's competent authorities should borrow low-interest loans from the National Bank or the City Bank to subsidize it. The term is temporarily set at six months, and at maturity, interest payment and transfer tickets are allowed. At the same time, public pawnshops should be added, and the interest rate should not exceed one dime. The municipal government's competent authorities should borrow low-interest loans from the National Bank or the City Bank to operate them. The locations for operation should be mainly in civilian residential areas.</p>
<p>Social Affairs No. 5, "It is proposed that the municipal government handle farmers' welfare undertakings, prosper the countryside, and transfer a part of the Shanghai Economic Agricultural Products received to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry as a demonstration agricultural product." Amended and passed. No. 6 "The National Compulsory Labor Law should be promoted to assist in the development of suburban areas." The general meeting resolved that "The Interim Council has already made a resolution on this case, urging the municipal government to implement it." No. 7 "Actively rescue unemployed workers." Six methods were proposed, and the general meeting passed them without objection.</p>
<p>Rebuild Morality, Shift Trends</p>
<p>Social Affairs No. 8 "Rebuild morality, shift social trends, and practice the New Life Movement as an urgent task." Tong Daoyun proposed that the point of "advocating early markets" should be added to the case, and he explained the relationship between getting up early and physical health and saving electricity. Most councilors believed that the regulations already had a provision for "advocating early markets" and did not need to be repeated, so it was not passed. Zhao Yangxiong argued that a clause should be added to the regulations to "Please ask the municipal government to increase the appropriation for the New Life Movement," because the New Life Movement focuses on publicity work, and nothing can be done without money. When the speaker put this point to a vote, Zhao Yangxiong stood up again and said: "Please pay attention, everyone. If you do not agree to add this method, then this case will be meaningless." The majority of the votes passed. Finally, the general meeting resolved to send it to the municipal government to be forwarded to the New Life Movement Promotion Association for earnest implementation. The regulations also stipulate that the first week of each month is the New Life Patrol Week, and all officials and civilians should abide by it, banning all bad films and improper entertainment, etc.</p>
<p>Social Affairs No. 9, the reason for the case is "It is proposed to strengthen social relief undertakings to realize the social policy of the Three Principles of the People." A total of eight points were listed, which were amended and passed by the general meeting.</p>
<p>Eighty-Six Votes Caused the Abolition: The Fate of the Housing Lease Management Committee Decided</p>
<p>When the Ninth Group held its last budget review meeting on the evening of the 19th, Convener Xu Yongzuo reported on the review results, believing that "in order to save money," all municipal government agencies that could be reduced or abolished should be abolished, so the "Housing Lease Management Committee" was also listed as being abolished. At that time, it aroused the opposition of Zhu Fojiu, the convener of the Tenth Group, who believed that the expenses of the Housing Lease Management Committee were extremely limited. If it was abolished, the severance pay and other expenses would leave little left, and the committee's mediation of housing lease disputes was indeed necessary. However, most of the people present advocated cancellation. At the same time, according to Speaker Pan, no matter how much money was saved, this agency should be abolished if it was not indispensable in fact. As a result, this case was stipulated to be reserved for discussion at the general meeting.</p>
<p>Thus, at yesterday's budget discussion meeting, the issue of abolishing the Housing Lease Management Committee once again aroused a heated debate. The result was that the committee should "die a natural death." However, the discussion of this case was very exciting, creating the most lively and tense scene at yesterday's meeting.</p>
<p>Before the speaker prepared to put it to a vote, Tao Baichuan first explained that this issue had taken a lot of time to study when the Tenth Group reviewed the regulations. According to the law, there was a reason for the existence of this committee, and the committee's expenses accounted for only 7/1000 of the total budget. He insisted that it could not be put to a vote immediately before the convener Zhu Fojiu explained it and before the general meeting debated it. However, the speaker reported that after he and Mayor Wu talked, the mayor believed that the Housing Lease Management Committee had no legal basis and could be abolished. Because labor disputes were not accepted by the court, a labor dispute arbitration committee was established. However, housing lease disputes can be accepted by the court, so there is no need to set up another agency, and the council can just abolish it. But according to Zhu Fojiu's statement, there are a very large number of housing lease dispute cases. Although the court can accept them, it will definitely take a long time. It may take a year to handle a case. At the same time, the committee's expenses are only 130 million yuan, less than 7/1000 of the total budget, so the impact on the budget is minimal. Finally, according to the law, before the constitution is implemented, according to the rules for sorting out current laws and regulations of the National Government in the 32nd year of the Republic, for local required laws and regulations, the order of the chairman of the National Defense Supreme Committee has the same effect as laws and regulations. Although the local required laws and regulations have been passed by the local authorities, the legislative procedure should still be completed, but they are still valid before the completion. The mayor said that there is no legal basis, and he hopes that the mayor will study it again. So his conclusion is (1) There is absolutely a legal basis, (2) The expenses are not much, (3) If the current Housing Lease Management Committee's organization is unsatisfactory, it can be thoroughly reformed in the future.</p>
<p>Then Qu Yue said: I have no grudges against the Housing Lease Management Committee, but the establishment of this committee has no legal basis. The Housing Lease Management Committee was established based on the wartime housing lease regulations. Now that the regulations have been revoked, the management committee should also be abolished. Later, someone proposed to reserve it for discussion on Monday, and Miao Jingzhou opposed, saying: An item of 7/1000 still needs to be postponed to Monday for discussion, and I don't know when the entire budget will be discussed. As a result, with a majority of eighty-six votes in favor of cancellation, the fate of the Housing Lease Management Committee was decided, and the committee's fifty-eight employees and twelve workers will also be laid off.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the Head of State on His Sixtieth Birthday: Telegraph the Whole Country to Hold It Unanimously</p>
<p>Social Affairs Proposal No. 1 is a proposal to launch a mass organization from this council to organize a preparatory committee to celebrate the sixtieth birthday of the head of state, establish a permanent memorial, and show respect for virtue and gratitude. Yesterday, it was passed by a majority of 101 votes, and four measures were decided: (1) This council will send a letter to all mass organizations in the city to organize a preparatory committee to celebrate the sixtieth birthday of the head of state. (2) This council will send two representatives to participate in the preparatory committee. (The general meeting decided to elect the speaker and deputy speaker to participate.) (3) The preparatory committee will refer to the example of donating aircrafts to celebrate the fiftieth birthday and devise a celebration method and establish a more meaningful permanent memorial. (4) Telegraph the councils of all provinces and cities to proceed unanimously.</p>
<p>Participation in the Investigation Team: Work Report of Five Councilors</p>
<p>Five councilors Zhao Junhao, He Yuanming, Zhu Xuefan, Wang Jian'e, and Ma Junshuo, who participated in the investigation team's office, reported to the council's general meeting yesterday, saying: "We and others were assigned to attend the receiving and handling work investigation team and participate in the work. We received the team's appointment letter on the 16th of this month and went to report on the morning of the next day. We attended the team's regular meeting for the first time on the 18th. We and others believe that this council is the local representative body of public opinion in Shanghai, and the future investigation work should be targeted at local agencies as more reasonable. After consulting with the team leader, we were instructed that since we have joined the team's work, we are one of the team members and do not need to make rigid regulations. However, we will be assigned local cases for processing as much as possible in the future when distributing work. On the same day, it was also decided to handle two important cases: (1) The case of the city government receiving enemy puppet vehicles and handing them over to Wantai for discounted repairs, (2) The case of the city government selling 4.2 billion yuan of goods from the Central Market. The above two cases had been decided at the last meeting to be sent to the court for investigation. After the meeting, the secretary reported and formally made a resolution. We and others did not express our opinions because we were attending for the first time and the facts were unclear. Later, the team leader designated Wang Jian'e, Ma Junshuo, and He Yuanming to review the entire file of the second case and study it from a legal perspective. All agreed that this case involved more administrative actions and should be handled by the original investigator paying attention to the relevant legal parts. The organization of the first group of the investigation team is three members, namely Zhang Tuanchang Zhiben, Cheng Supervisor Zhongxing, and Wu Committee Wangji, etc. Later, Zhang Committee Qingzhen and Fan Committee Zhengbo joined, so the number of people has increased by two more than the stipulated organization. We and others joined as councilors, so there seems to be a distinction in our duties. In terms of nature, we are only in an assisting position. Since the first group of the investigation team started working in Shanghai, it has been sending letters to the receiving agencies to request receiving reports and instructing them to prepare receiving registers so that they can be called up at any time. Currently, 69 units have submitted reports, and only the Foreign Affairs Bureau and the War Criminals Management Office have not responded. As for the people's secret reports, as of September 19, there were 313 cases, which are listed as follows:</p>
<p>48 cases of secret reports about housing and land disputes, 26 cases of secret reports about receiving corruption, 32 cases of secret reports about improper or illegal corruption in handling enemy puppet goods, 33 cases of secret reports about concealing enemy puppet goods, 43 cases of secret reports about the processing bureau not issuing bonuses, 45 cases of secret reports about requesting the return of occupied property, and 86 cases of miscellaneous secret reports about various corruptions. According to Secretary Xu Longchuan's oral report, the above cases have been processed, and about 80% of the initial investigations have been completed. We and others joined the work in the stage when the investigation team is about to end, so we will no longer re-investigate the cases that have been processed. In fact, we have no right to re-investigate. In the future, we will work under the leadership of the team leader and plan to rotate to the meeting to handle affairs after the adjournment of this council meeting. However, there is no clear regulation on the deadline for the investigation. We and others are very willing to make a concrete report at the next report, and we hope that the speaker, deputy speaker, and all the other members will give instructions and supervision at any time."</p>
<h3>After Wallace's Resignation</h3>
<p>U.S. Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace resigned the day before yesterday. This was not unexpected news. After Wallace delivered a speech in New York and published his letter to President Truman dated August 23 in various U.S. newspapers, not only did it make Secretary of State Byrnes, who was in Paris, feel very uneasy, but also Secretary of the Navy Forrestal and Secretary of the Army Patterson felt dissatisfied. They had to jointly send a letter to President Truman, stating that no one in the U.S. Army and Navy departments was planning to take preemptive measures against the Soviet Union. The discrepancies in opinions within the U.S. government were completely exposed, which would inevitably affect the U.S.'s international standing, especially hitting the Paris Peace Conference hard, which would force President Truman to make a choice. Wallace's resignation was obviously the result of President Truman's choice.</p>
<p>President Truman explained the reasons for requesting Wallace's resignation, saying: "The government supports the foreign policy adopted by Secretary of State Byrnes. While citizens are absolutely free to express their disagreement with the government's policies, the government itself must maintain consistency. Now, Minister Wallace has a 'fundamental conflict' with the government, which is very obvious. The only solution is for Mr. Wallace to resign. At the same time, I also believe that he would rather freely express his opinions as a citizen." It is widely rumored that Wallace's resignation was due to Secretary of State Byrnes requesting the President to state his position, and that Wallace was forced to resign. Although this statement has been denied by the White House, in any case, President Truman's decision this time felt like there was no other way to go, and he had to make this decision.</p>
<p>Wallace's resignation will undoubtedly have a far-reaching impact on U.S. domestic and foreign policy. Although Secretary of State Byrnes's foreign policy has gained President Truman's support, leading to the dismissal of opponent Wallace, it cannot be immediately seen as a victory for Byrnes. Because Wallace was the only remaining minister from President Roosevelt's New Deal era and has always been regarded as the successor to the New Deal. His published speeches and advocacy will have some supporters within the United States, especially the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). According to a statement issued by the CIO's Political Action Committee, Minister Wallace's forced resignation is a major blow to freedom and peace in the United States. At the same time, Wallace himself also stated after announcing his resignation: "I am determined to continue to fight for peace, and I believe that the American people can join the struggle I lead with the heroic spirit of the late President Roosevelt." Based on this, Wallace's departure will inevitably have some significant impact on the House of Representatives elections in early winter this year.</p>
<p>However, if we examine U.S. party politics, we can see that the political path Wallace will take in the future is also a serious question. Because for more than a hundred years in the United States, there have only been two major political parties, the Democratic and Republican parties, and a third party has not yet grown. About thirty years ago, Senator La Follette attempted to form a third party, which was the Progressive Party, but its influence was limited to the state of Wisconsin. In addition, there is also a Labor Party, but except for the state of New York, it does not have members in other states, so it is also difficult to become a powerful third party. Let us assume that Wallace will rely on the support of the CIO Political Action Committee, but the general American people regard the CIO as an organ of the Communist Party, so it seems difficult to gain the support of the majority of the American people.</p>
<p>Although the internal divisions within the U.S. government have become unified due to Wallace's resignation, how the United States can create world peace is still the most serious problem at present. Wallace gave a speech after his resignation, saying: "I do not believe in dividing the earth into two worlds, and I will continue to advocate the principle of living in one world. There is no peace except for 'One World.'" He also criticized the Truman administration's foreign policy errors, saying that it failed to recognize the "basic facts" that caused the two world wars, and now it is threatening a third world war, but the third world war will be a "nuclear war." This serious warning is indeed worth pondering by President Truman and Byrnes. But how can the United States create a "One World" world without splitting into two blocs? This is another question worth studying. In his letter to President Truman, Wallace actually declared that some people in the U.S. Army and Navy were planning to use "preemptive" measures against the Soviet Union. No one would believe such remarks, and they have already been denied by the two secretaries of the Army and Navy, which shows that this is just Wallace's sensitivity or fantasy. We believe that farsighted politicians should not have this fantasy in the first place, let alone casually publish it. Because the existence of this kind of fantasy can easily cause unfortunate disasters, not only will international cooperation be hindered and unable to be realized, but also the suspicion and misunderstanding between the great powers will become deeper and deeper, and will never be eliminated.</p>

<h3>U.S. and Soviet Leaders Will Not Meet Before the Peace Conference Reaches a Reasonable Result - White House Press Secretary Ross Announced Yesterday</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] Washington, Emergency Broadcast from Paris on the 21st: White House Press Secretary Ross announced this morning: The statement that President Truman will directly meet with Stalin if the Paris Peace Conference fails to achieve reasonable peace is not true. Ross also stated that since Wallace's resignation, Truman has not received any information from Byrnes. As for Wallace's successor, it will not be announced today.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 20th] It has only been a few months since President Truman ordered Interior Secretary Ickes to resign voluntarily, and now Secretary of Commerce Wallace has been ordered to resign. Wallace was the only remaining minister from the late President Roosevelt's New Deal era, and now he has also left the Truman administration. It is not yet known what political path he will take in the future. For decades, the United States has only had two major political parties, which are limited to the state of Wisconsin. In addition, there is also a Labor Party, but it has no members except in the state of New York. Wallace may later rely on the support of the Congress of Industrial Organizations Political Action Committee, which is almost certain. However, Americans will regard the CIO as an organ of the Communist Party. It is not yet known whether Wallace will move to New York or remain in Washington.</p>
<h3>After Wallace Leaves the Cabinet, U.S. Diplomacy Returns to Normal, Various Committees of the Peace Conference Continue to Meet, and Byrnes Resumes His Active Posture</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] The departure of Secretary of Commerce Wallace from the Cabinet has had an impact, causing Secretary of State Byrnes, who is far away in Paris, to become more active. However, the government's foreign policy is still vaguely in a fog. For this reason, senior State Department officials are currently considering launching several speeches to clarify to the American people and the world what President Truman meant when he said that there would be no change in U.S. foreign policy. There are now several opportunities to use to discuss national policy, namely (1) when the United Nations General Assembly meets in New York on October 23, Truman will preside over the opening ceremony and deliver a speech, (2) Byrnes may return to the country from Paris in mid-October and will probably also give a speech. Byrnes has received invitations from all sides to speak on foreign policy. According to responsible diplomatic figures, President Truman's final decision to ask Wallace to resign has allowed U.S. diplomacy to return to normal. This move has the following important meanings: it allows the country to know that the government is not embarking on Wallace's so-called Green Fat Peaceful Policy, and it also makes Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, and other representatives of the Peace Conference understand that Byrnes has Truman's 100% support and is the leader of U.S. foreign policy today.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper News] Paris Broadcast on the 21st: The Soviet delegation's attempt to prevent the inclusion of the establishment of the South Tyrol Autonomous Region in the treaty with Italy was rejected.

<h3>British Fleet Begins Autumn Maneuvers in the Mediterranean, Greece and Malta Are Assumed Targets</h3>

<h3>Wallace Delivers Broadcast Speech, Determined to Fight for Peace, Uphold the Concept of "One World," Praises Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] After resigning as Secretary of Commerce, Wallace broadcasted this morning, stating: "Fighting for peace is more important than high-ranking positions and generous salaries, and more important than the concerns of partisan politics. I promised President Truman on Wednesday that I would not speak for the time being. The President's actions this time have restored my freedom of speech. Some points in my speech at Madison Square Garden have caused great misunderstandings, and should be corrected." Wallace continued, "I will continue to fight for peace, and I hope that people across the nation will join this sacred task. Our current foreign policy does not recognize reality. This reality has quickly led to two world wars, and there is now a risk of another war, and this time it will be a war with atomic bombs. As far back as fifteen years ago, I advocated the One World policy. I do not believe in two worlds. Unless we are in one world, we cannot achieve peace. What I want to make clear again is that I oppose all imperialism and aggression, whether it comes from the Soviet Union, Britain, or the United States. At the same time, it must be stated that the concept of One World must be firmly upheld. If it is necessary to adopt regionalism to give the economic and political reality of the world an implementation method, the interests of small countries must also be taken into account, just as the small countries in the Western Hemisphere enjoy under President Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy. The success of any policy ultimately depends on the trust and will of the people."</p>
<h3>Democratic Party Split Affects Next Election</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 20th] Democratic Senator Pepper said tonight that Secretary of Commerce Wallace's resignation may have far-reaching effects on the country and the Democratic Party.

<p>[This Newspaper News] San Francisco Broadcast on the 21st: Wallace's resignation immediately made all parties speculate whether he would split the Democratic Party and form a third party.

At the same time, Communist Party Inspection Committee Secretary Zidanov also issued a notice, listing regular examples of violations of collective farm rules, saying that farm managers illegally occupied part of the public property for their own benefit.

<p>[United Press, Moscow, 20th] Moscow newspapers revealed today that Soviet communism is now encountering an unprecedentedly serious threat in history, which threatens the entire foundation of the Soviet Union.

<h3>Days Grow Shorter, Nights Grow Longer: Supply Becomes More Difficult; Urges Conservation of Electricity: Electric Power Company Issues Another Emergency Notice; Prepares to Adopt Expanded Restriction Measures</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Electric Power Company, due to the approaching winter and the increased electricity needs of citizens, yesterday issued another emergency notice, separately notifying all users that it is preparing to adopt expanded restriction measures for ordinary users, and the supply of electricity for winter heating may also be suspended. A reporter from the East China News Agency learned from the municipal electricity authorities yesterday that the company's pre-war power generation capacity reached 183,000 kilowatts, but now it is only 119,000 kilowatts, of which 26,000 kilowatts must be allocated to the Zhabei Chinese Merchants and the Nanshi Three Electric Companies to supply the residents of Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, Wusong, and Zhenru areas. Therefore, the Shanghai Electric Power Company and its affiliated Huxi Electric Power Company actually have only 93,000 kilowatts, which is far from sufficient each month. It is reported that the current electricity consumption has exceeded the capacity of the company's Yangshupu Power Plant by 15,000 kilowatts. To cope with this situation, the company has agreed with major industrial users, such as cotton mills, on a rotating power outage system, and the daily shutdown time for large cotton mills has been changed to 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM. The company has also suspended the approval of new connections or increased electric heating and industrial power loads in order to barely maintain through this difficult period. Although the authorities have assisted the company in various ways to order new machinery and repair damaged parts, it is unlikely that power generation will increase before the end of January next year. As the current situation is difficult to maintain and winter is approaching, with shorter days and longer nights, the electricity consumption of citizens will further increase, and the electricity shortage is bound to become more serious. Therefore, the company urges citizens to conserve electricity, otherwise it will inevitably take expanded restriction measures and other necessary measures.</p>

<h3>Living Buddha; Arrested for Performing Magic; Ignorant People Band Together; Petitioning</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, dozens of ignorant people suddenly came to the Putuo Road Police Station, demanding the release of the "Living Buddha," causing a tense situation. It turned out that a man named Qin Shilong, residing at 3985 Changshou Road in the jurisdiction, came to Shanghai from his hometown of Yangzhou in May of this year, claiming to be possessed by the "Master of Heaven," able to cure all diseases. Coincidentally, the second landlord with whom he lived suffered from severe toothache and tried to have him "perform magic" to cure it, which actually worked. This was quickly spread far and wide, and dozens of people requested treatment every day. The name of the "Living Buddha" became well-known in the area. The Putuo Road Police Station, fearing that there were other circumstances and that he was practicing medicine under false pretenses, specifically ordered the police to summon Qin the day before yesterday to inquire about the details. According to him, he used to be a shoeshine boy, but after losing his job, he returned home and joined the Fushantang as an incense burner. He dreamed at night of the "Master of Heaven" teaching him the art of medicine, instructing him to come to Shanghai to save the people. The police station considered his confession to be absurd and sentenced him to detention for seven days, after which he would be deported. Unexpectedly, just yesterday afternoon, residents came to petition, requesting his release. After the police explained the facts, the residents dispersed reluctantly.</p>

<h3>Meddy Candy Company Bankrupt; Manager and Accountant Flee, Captured; Deficit of Hundreds of Millions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Meddy Candy Company, located at 107 Wenmiao Road, Nanjing, was a joint-stock company selling fresh orange juice, and its business was originally quite good. However, under the collusion of manager Wu Peilin and chief accountant Ye Bangyao, the company went bankrupt. Wu and others secretly concealed this and continued to use the company's name to fraudulently obtain large sums of money, resulting in a deficit of hundreds of millions of yuan, and then fled without a trace. A shareholder of the company, Mr. Liu, learned of this and reported it to the Penglai Police Sub-bureau for investigation. Yesterday morning, Yao Zhilong, the chief of the criminal investigation section of the sub-bureau, along with officers Yang Mianzhi, Zhang Shusheng, Zhang Detong, and Chen Hailin, discovered that Ye Bangyao was having morning tea at the East Asia Restaurant on Nanjing Road. They rushed to the address and arrested him. Under interrogation, he revealed that Wu Peilin was hiding in Room 229 of the Zhongzhou Hotel on Shandong Road. They then rushed to that location and captured Wu, who was taking a nap. According to their confessions, the company was in debt for hundreds of millions of yuan due to excessive losses and poor operations. It was also learned that a Mr. Bao, an employee of the Jinlei Advertising Company, was also a victim. The police station is currently summoning the company's shareholders for questioning.

<h3>Dispute Over Post-War Reconstruction Association; Eighty-Year-Old Woman Lies on the Ground, Refusing to Leave; Claims She Wants to Reclaim the Lease Rights from Twenty-Eight Years Ago</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, the local court of this city tried a case of obstruction of freedom. The plaintiff was Wu Tiecheng, the current Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters (representing the China Post-War Reconstruction Association). The defendants were Zhou Lushi, Zhou Wenying, Zhou Fengqi, and several others. Wu was represented in court by Jiang Hao, the current city councilor, while only Zhou Wenying appeared on the defendant's side. According to Jiang Hao's statement to the court, after the victory, the China Post-War Reconstruction Association moved to Shanghai and leased Room 402 of the Meilun Building at 153 Beijing Road from the American company Taly, paying rent in advance until the end of September of this year. On June 28 of this year, Zhou Wenying, a resident of Room 303 in the building, along with her husband Li Chengfang, nephew Zhou Fengqi, and Zhou Lushi, who was already eighty years old, came and claimed that they had lived in the house in 1939 and wanted to continue living there. Zhou Lushi threatened with her old age and illness, lying on the ground and refusing to leave. The next day, they moved in broken sofas and other miscellaneous furniture. The police station was notified and sent officers to investigate, but Zhou and others could not produce a lease. This behavior clearly constitutes an obstruction of freedom and should be dealt with according to the law. Zhou Wenying claimed that the China Post-War Reconstruction Association's office was not for their own use but was sublet to others to open a trading company. Therefore, she requested the return of the lease rights to the house from 1939. After an investigation by the court, the hearing was adjourned to the morning of the 28th of this month for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Longhua Cement Factory Lays Off Workers; Management Clarifies the Situation Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Longhua Cement Factory, belonging to the Shanghai Cement Company in this city, recently laid off workers due to its inability to maintain operations, causing a labor dispute. According to the management yesterday, since this spring, the factory has not only suffered a fatal blow in terms of sales due to the continuous dumping of foreign goods, but also faced layers of torment in terms of production and transportation, forcing it to move towards bankruptcy. Since July 25, the company has suspended production because the business prospects were hopeless. At that time, it originally intended to lay off the surplus workers, but in consideration of the livelihoods of the workers, it still hoped to maintain operations. Now, due to the constraints of the environment, it has to lay them off from the 16th of this month, which is a last resort for the company.</p>
<h3>"Opening Peach Orchard" to Steal Antiques; Thieves Are Active Again; Xie Da Xiang Suffers Great Losses</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The ranks of the "Touching and Stealing Brigade" have not yet disappeared from people's minds, but thieves have been active again in the past few days.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the home of Liang Zangsheng at 627 West Aihams Road was visited by thieves, who performed two techniques in a row—"Opening the Peach Orchard" and "Polishing Both Sides," meaning they dug through the bamboo fence and then smashed the glass window. As a result, several valuable antiques displayed in the living room, a bronze mirror, a jade water container of both larger and smaller sizes, a blue vase, and two felt hats and seven raincoats hanging on the coat rack, as well as a radio, were all taken away. Such an action would have taken a long time, but it never alerted the owner. It was not until 7:00 AM, when the owner got up, that he discovered that so many things had been stolen and immediately reported it to the police station. He said that the loss of the radio, felt hats, raincoats, etc., was small, about two hundred thousand yuan, but the antiques were difficult to estimate. After the police station sent officers to investigate the scene, they discovered that the cunning thief had left no trace behind, so this unsolved case is indeed giving the police officers a headache!</p>
<p>Also, the Xie Da Xiang store in the Eight Immortals Bridge area was robbed of more than eighty bolts of cloth the night before last, worth more than ten million yuan.</p>

<h3>Trial of Fake Minister Chuan Shishuo Concluded Yesterday; Four Witnesses Gave Testimony Favorable to the Defendant; Judge Presented Large Volume of Evidence; Adjourned for Verdict on the 28th After Clarification</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The case of Chuan Shishuo, one of the giants of the puppet government, who successively served as "Minister of Railways," "Governor of Zhejiang Province and Commander of the Security Forces," and "Minister of Construction," which had been delayed since the first trial by the collegiate panel of the High Court in April of this year, was retried yesterday morning in the Criminal Division 1 of the High Court in Tilanqiao. The debate concluded, and the verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 28th of this month.</p>
<p>At 10:15 AM, Presiding Judge Liu Yugui, along with Judges Cao Jun and Qiu Huanxing, Prosecutor Dai Rongduo, and Clerk Li Jinzhang, took their seats and ordered the bailiffs to escort the defendant in. Chuan was dressed in a dark gray Chinese gown, wearing brown leather shoes, with a flat-top haircut, his hair already gray, his face pale and yellow, holding a glasses case, and looking mentally exhausted. First, the court asked him his age, which was 56, his place of origin, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, and his last puppet post, which was "Minister of Construction." Judge Liu then declared that the case was being retried today in accordance with procedure. During the investigation period, the court had collected relevant evidence from the Zhejiang Provincial Government, the Ministry of Transportation, and other departments. The evidence submitted by the defendant had also been investigated in Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, and other places, and replies had been received. At this point, the defendant's defense attorney stood up and stated that four witnesses had arrived to testify for the defendant and requested that the court call them. Judge Liu ordered them to be seated aside.</p>
<p>Witness He Peirong</p>
<p>Claimed: During the War of Resistance, he served as the chairman of the Kuomintang branch in two locations and as a propagandist for the Third War Zone. In early 1944, he came to Shanghai for secret work and was protected by the defendant. In June, he went to Nanjing with the defendant to discuss a defection plan with the puppet government, but it was not realized due to the sudden surrender of the enemy.</p>
<p>Mao Jingquan</p>
<p>Claimed: His late father, Mao Yun, was responsible for the work of the Military Intelligence Bureau in the Nanjing-Shanghai area during the War of Resistance. When the defendant served as the puppet Minister of Railways, the two sides had contact. At that time, the work agencies in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing area were successively broken up by the enemy military police, and personnel were arrested, including his father. The defendant personally went to the enemy military police to intercede, but to no avail. Later, he entrusted someone to bribe the translator and captain inside to destroy the evidence, and he was released. The work agencies in the Shanghai area were also able to be preserved thanks to this. Later, when his father went to Chongqing, the Chairman ordered a commendation. In 1942, he returned to Shanghai to work. At that time, the defendant was the puppet Governor of Zhejiang Province, so he went to Hangzhou to see the defendant. He personally went to the provincial government three times to negotiate the complete handover of military power in Zhejiang Province to seek defection. However, the enemy learned of this, and the defendant lost his position as governor as a result. Later, during his tenure as the puppet Minister of Construction, he also provided protection for the work in many ways. His father later fell ill and died. Before his death, he constantly instructed the defendant, and the defendant provided information at all times.</p>
<p>Wang Yuxiang</p>
<p>Was one of the founders of Datong University and testified for the defendant on two points: (1) In 1943, the puppet Ministry of Education ordered Datong University to submit a list of faculty and students. The school board decided to ignore it, but when there was really no way out, they closed the door. On the one hand, because the defendant in this case had also served as a professor at Datong in the past, he entrusted him to tell the puppet Ministry of Education not to destroy the education sector. As a result, universities such as Datong and Fudan were able to survive safely. (2) In 1941, the underground workers of the government and the puppet side were fighting fiercely in Shanghai. One day, a student from Datong was shot and killed when he left the school gate. After investigation, it was found that the student was a member of the puppet organization. "76" sent a letter threatening them, which was also resolved with the help of the defendant in this case.</p>
<p>Gong Weizhen</p>
<p>Claimed: In January 1943, because of her participation in Party work, her entire family was arrested by the enemy military police and sent to Changzhou for three months of confinement. Later, because she knew the defendant's wife, she was rescued and released by the defendant. Her husband's sentence was also reduced.</p>
<p>Trying to Shirk Guilt Requires Demonstrating Merit First</p>
<p>After the four witnesses were questioned, the court asked the defendant if he had anything to say. He replied that he had several points to add: (1) When he was initially arrested by the enemy military police and forced to join the puppet government, he had obtained the consent of Mao [Yun]. Mao Jingquan did not know about this. (2) He Peirong only mentioned a part of it. In the second half of 1942, he rescued Kong Jingshi, the commander of the 3rd Battalion of the Loyal Salvation Army, and more than 30 of his subordinates. He nominally bailed them out to the enemy military police, and they were trained by us. Later, they were transferred to Yuyao and then to Wuhu and released. (3) The defendant had been working in the education sector for 20 years. The puppet government originally invited me to be responsible for education, but I declined. When Zhao Zhengping served as the puppet Minister of Education, the education sector in Shanghai was in a state of panic. I advised Zhao to allow the education sector in Shanghai to maintain its freedom and not to interfere.</p>
<p>Real Evidence</p>
<p>Judge Liu then showed the defendant an article he published in the commemorative album of the puppet national government's return to the capital, "The Sino-Japanese Cultural Association and Sino-Japanese Cultural Cooperation," and asked if he had anything to say. He replied: This is an empty article, written by the secretary when I was in the Ministry of Railways. The court then showed the defendant a large number of documents collected from various agencies, including the puppet Ministry of Railways' proposal to the puppet Executive Yuan to collect the shares of the puppet Central China Railway Company, the puppet Executive Yuan's order for the defendant to go to Japan to inspect the railway industry and attend the Second "East Asia Economic Roundtable Conference," the puppet Ministry of Railways' regulations designating various freight rates for the puppet Central China Railway Company, the puppet Ministry of Construction's measures on holding the issuance of construction bonds, and the supervision and management regulations on Sino-Japanese joint ventures, the puppet Zhejiang Province's Clearing the Countryside Plan and its implementation measures, assisting enemy Deng troops in purchasing timber and other military supplies, and implementing a security system and policy guidelines. There were also a large number of files on the focus of the security team plan in the Clearing the Countryside Plan being to cooperate with the Japanese military's military operations to establish security. After reading them, the defendant admitted most of them but stated: The supervision and management regulations on Sino-Japanese joint ventures were drafted by Chen Junhui, the puppet Minister of Industry. The so-called focus in the Clearing the Countryside Plan was issued by the puppet Clearing the Countryside Committee. Nominally, the clearing was implemented by the puppet government, but in reality, it was the Japanese army that was doing it. The establishment of the Zhejiang Province security system was because there were many mixed troops under the control of the Japanese, who were abusing their power to harass the local area. I negotiated with the Japanese and asked the Chinese side to manage it. The Japanese were very opposed to the use of force after its establishment. On average, only two or thirty old guns were given to every hundred people. After the questioning was completed at 12:00 PM, the debate began. First, the prosecutor presented the indictment, then the defendant's defense attorneys, Zhang Shizhao and Gu [Name], responded until about 1:00 PM. The court adjourned for a verdict on the 28th.</p>

<h3>Jiangwan Everywhere Golds Rushed For: Japanese Soldiers Hid Gold, Old Woman Seeks Treasure</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Following external rumors that the enemy navy had hidden a huge sum of gold bars on Fuxing Island in this city, which was then swallowed up by someone, another gold rush incident involving hidden enemy gold bars has occurred in the Jiangwan area of this city.</p>
<p>It is said that the Japanese Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, including the To Unit, had purchased a large quantity of gold bars in Taiwan and Shanghai, and last summer, Japanese soldiers loaded them onto several trucks and transported them to the vicinity of the intersection of Jiangwan Yinxiang Road, where they were hidden in an air-raid shelter. This was observed by a farmer nearby, but at that time, due to Japanese sentries enforcing martial law, the distance was quite far, and it was nighttime, so it was not possible to see clearly. Later, the air-raid shelter was filled in, but the old woman had gone alone to dig for gold many times, keeping the matter a secret. After neighbors found out, she revealed the truth, leading to residents carrying shovels and hoes to dig holes in search of treasure in the Jiangwan Airport, former city center, former To Unit headquarters, and Jiangwan Racecourse areas in recent weeks. There were even diggers in Hongkou Park everywhere. How this matter will be handled is of great concern to all parties, and it is currently awaiting investigation and verification by the authorities.</p>
<h3>Fish Market Tricycle Rickshaw Pullers Rally to the Social Affairs Bureau to Petition</h3>
<p>During the War of Resistance, goods for fish vendors at this city's fish market were transported by tricycle rickshaws. After the victory, trucks were used instead, causing more than two thousand tricycle rickshaw workers to face unemployment. Yesterday morning, about six hundred workers in the tricycle rickshaw transportation industry drove their tricycle rickshaws in a group to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, and distributed a "Solemn Appeal to All Circles to Win Back Rice Bowls for Thousands of People." The person in charge of mediation at the Social Affairs Bureau found this matter quite difficult, saying that it was inconvenient to interfere with the business of truck merchants, but considering the livelihoods of these more than two thousand workers, a solution had to be found. It was not until about 4 PM that the person in charge of the Social Affairs Bureau persuaded the workers to disband first, and to send representatives to prepare a written report of the situation to the Social Affairs Bureau for further mediation.</p>
<h3>Four Business and Industrial Groups in This City Host Tea Party to Welcome Mr. Paul Locher: Express the Need to Improve the Current Situation of Our Laborers, and Hope to Work Hard to Complete Industrialization</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the China Industrial Association, and the China Labor Association jointly welcomed Mr. Paul Locher, Counselor of the International Labor Organization, who was invited to China for investigation, at the Free Hall of the International Hotel. Among those present were Wang Xiaolai and Shou Jingwei of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Shui Xiangyun of the General Labor Union, Wu Yunfu of the Shanghai Branch of the National Industrial Association, Zhu Xuefan of the China Labor Association, Li Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Lu Jingshi, Director of the Labor Training Department of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Cheng Haifeng, Director of the China Branch of the International Labor Organization, Qian Naixin, representative of Mayor Wu, and over a hundred people from the business and industrial community, including Hu Xiyuan, Zhang Ziheng, Hong Nianzu, Wang Renlin, and Qiu Changjiang. Shou Jingwei presided over the meeting, and Wu Yunfu gave a speech on behalf of the group, stating briefly that the organization of the International Labor Organization provides a connection between workers in countries around the world. China has suffered threats and destruction from the enemy during the eight years of the War of Resistance, but only the help of international friends (especially in the labor sector) is worth remembering. Allied countries such as Britain and the United States have not only provided spiritual help, but also material help (such as donations), and the efforts of the International Labor Organization in this regard cannot be ignored. This time, Mr. Paul Locher has been invited to China, and it is believed that this will help the welfare of Chinese workers. China is an industrially backward country, and its industrial equipment and worker treatment are not as good as others. We hope that Mr. Paul Locher will provide strong assistance, and we would like to welcome and pay our respects on behalf of the workers of this city. After representatives of the China Labor Association and others delivered welcome speeches, Mr. Paul Locher gave a speech, first expressing his heartfelt gratitude for the joint welcome from the four business and industrial groups, and expressing great pleasure. He then introduced the purpose of the International Labor Organization, which is to seek the welfare of workers. He said that he was invited to China by the Chinese Ministry of Social Affairs, hoping to promote close cooperation between the Chinese Labor Bureau and the International Labor Organization, and that the Three Principles of the People advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen are fully in line with the International Labor Organization's policies, such as protecting labor for nationalism, seeking cooperation between labor and capital for democracy, and improving the lives of workers for people's livelihood. After observing for two weeks since arriving in China, Mr. Locher believes that the current labor situation in China is like the traffic situation on Nanjing Road: rickshaws, tricycle rickshaws, and motor vehicles are all mixed together, in a chaotic mess. This kind of unreasonable phenomenon must be improved. Mr. Locher finally stated that all countries in the world hope that China can become an industrialized country, and China must increase production and work hard. He wished that freedom and democracy could guide China on the road to prosperity. Cheng Haifeng, Director of the China Branch of the International Labor Organization, said in his speech that the four groups present today represent two different positions and interests—labor and capital. He hoped that this would be the prelude to labor-capital coordination in China. Li Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, said that the principles for improving the labor sector established by the International Labor Organization are very important for China. For example, the eight-hour work system was decided by the International Labor Organization long ago, and it is now widely implemented in Shanghai. He also stated that China's industry today is facing its greatest crisis. China has been destroyed by a long war, and it should not only be restored, but also exceed its original achievements. This work is difficult, and in this critical stage, labor and capital must understand and cooperate thoroughly. Finally, after Lian Kai, Director of the Industrial and Mining Inspection Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs, delivered a speech, the conference ended at 5 PM.</p>

<h3>Chen Bozhuang Speaks on the Major Corruption Case in the Two Railway Bureaus: Determined to Replace Zhang Hongtu and Zhang Bokang Early On, Yu Xiangyan's False Accusations Not Worth a Laugh</h3>
<p>The major corruption case involving Qiang Hongtu, Director of the Materials Department of the Jinghu Railway Bureau, has attracted much attention from the public since the first trial was held the day before yesterday. This reporter specially visited Chen Bozhuang, Director of the Railway Bureau, who replied as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In the past ten days, I have been following the orders of the department, planning the construction for the entire year of next year, and have been very busy. I have not had time to pay attention to all the news of the trial of this case. However, I read the first paragraph of Zhang Hongtu's defense in the Xinwenbao on the 14th, stating that Zhang Bokang was brought in by me and was not his private employee, and that he had asked to replace Zhang Bokang, but I refused. His intention was nothing more than to wash away his relationship with Zhang Bokang, and I have to tell the truth: (1) Zhang Hongtu and Zhang Bokang were both employees of the Materials Division. Before I was ordered to take over the Jinghu District last year, I had never met them before. Zhang Bokang was assigned by the department as a reception staff member, and Zhang Hongtu was assigned by the department as the Director of the Materials Department, and Zhang Bokang's appointment as the Chief of the Purchasing Section was requested by Zhang Hongtu. (2) In April of this year, there were rumors inside and outside the bureau about the Materials Department. At that time, I asked Zhang Ziyue, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Shen Yi, former Director of the Ministry of Communications and current Mayor of Dalian, and Mr. Yin Zhongrong, Secretary of the Executive Yuan, to recommend candidates for the Chief of the Purchasing Section. At that time, Special Commissioner Zhang had a suitable candidate, but because the candidate was sent to North China by Vice President Weng to handle reception work, the agreement was not reached. I also told Zhang Hongtu about this matter. Since he knew that I was determined to replace Zhang Bokang, whom he had requested to be appointed, he recommended someone from the Materials Division to take over. He probably feared that I would find someone I did not know, so he recommended an acquaintance to resist and cover up. Of course, I did not consider it.</p>
<p>(2) Before this case was revealed, Hua Shousong, Director of the Materials Division, told me that Minister Yu Qiaofeng had heard rumors about Zhang Hongtu's impropriety a month before leaving office, and ordered Director Hua to investigate secretly, but Minister Yu did not issue the same secret order to me. Therefore, I decided to replace Zhang Hongtu and asked Minister Yu Dawei to send someone else, but Minister Dawei did not have a suitable candidate to send at the time. Therefore, on May 28, I ordered that all purchases must be handled by Deputy Director Hou Huahua. After this order was issued, all employees in the bureau knew that I did not trust the Materials Department and had no private relationship. The next day, there were posters attacking the department for corruption. Then, Shen Guizhang, Huang Ruzhen, and others secretly reported the matter, and the bureau immediately tracked down and investigated the case and sent it to the court.</p>
<p>(3) Yu Xiangyan's accusations of bribing me with 5 million yuan and inviting him to meetings three times are completely fabricated and not worth a laugh. I have been working for decades, and the community has its own evaluation.</p>
<h3>Enemy Agent Chen Bohu Arrested</h3>
<p>Chen Bohu, a native of Gaoqiao, served as a secret agent for the enemy gendarmerie during the enemy-puppet period. After the victory, he fled to another port.

After interrogation and confirmation, he was transferred to the Gaojian Office yesterday afternoon, and he will soon be prosecuted by the office according to law.</p>

<h3>Zhou Bangjun Sentenced to Three Years, Li Zulai's Trial Concluded Awaiting Judgment</h3>

Zhou, wearing a light gray gown, did not express any opinion upon hearing the verdict, but only requested to see his family for a talk. The court granted his request, and after the talk, he was escorted back to prison by the bailiffs.</p>

Tao Ziwen, Section Chief of the Puppet Zhejiang Yin County Government, was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment and deprived of his civil rights for two years.

<h3>Ministry of Education Allocates Temporary Funds for National Education: Print Textbooks for People's Schools, Assign Seven Joint Supply Offices to Supply 350,000 Copies</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Nanjing] The temporary national education fund for this year, i.e., the fund for eliminating illiteracy, was originally approved at 60 million yuan. Because the amount was too small and the needs of various provinces and cities were too great, it was impossible to allocate. It has now been doubled to 120 million yuan. Since the increase is not much, it is feared that there will be little benefit if it is allocated to the provinces in a piecemeal fashion. The Ministry of Education intends to use this fund to print textbooks for people's schools, with 300 yuan per book, planning to print 350,000 copies, totaling 105 million yuan, and the remaining 15 million yuan will be reserved for other uses. The Ministry of Education has recently sent a special letter to the Seven Joint Supply Offices of National Primary and Secondary School Textbooks, ordering them to print 200,000 copies of textbooks for elementary adult classes and 150,000 copies of textbooks for elementary women's classes, and distribute them to the education departments and bureaus of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Nanjing, Shanghai, and Beiping for use.</p>

<h3>The Qunsheng Team Wins Two Consecutive Victories, Defeating the Huanan Team Again Yesterday; Performance is More Exciting Than the First Match</h3>
<p>The Qunsheng basketball team's second match in Shanghai took place yesterday at 8:00 PM at the Municipal Stadium against the local basketball "Little Overlord," Huanan. Despite the heavy rain, there were still many spectators, and Hao Gengsheng, a supervisor from the Ministry of Education, also came to watch the game in the rain. As a result, Qunsheng defeated Huanan with a score of 53 to 35. In the first half, Qunsheng took the lead with a score of 21 to 15.</p>
<p>Extremely Exciting</p>
<p>Qunsheng fielded their five strongest players: Chen Jinde, Chen Jinzhi, Cai Lianke, Cai Wenhua, and Cai Wenzhang. Huanan responded with Zhang Liangxiong, Huang Tianlie, Li Ruixiong, Liu Fushan, and Liu Fuqiang. In the first half, Huanan fought hard, and the competition between the two sides was fierce, making it difficult for Qunsheng to win. The first quarter ended in a tie, and Qunsheng only won by six points in the first half. In the second half, Qunsheng had an extremely exciting performance, which was the decisive section. In the end, Huanan tried to catch up, but it was too late.</p>
<p>Fierce Competition</p>
<p>Chen Jinzhi opened the scoring, and Huanan's Li Ruixiong scored two free throws, leading 4 to 2. Then, the score became tied at 5. Chen Jinzhi and Cai Wenhua both scored, and Qunsheng took the lead. Huanan was unwilling to show weakness, and the score was tied again at 9. Cai Wenhua and Cai Wenzhang scored one free throw each, adding three points. Huanan's Huang Tianlie scored twice, making the score 13 to 12, with Huanan taking a one-point lead. When Wenhua made a free throw, the first quarter ended with a tie at 13, with the colors of autumn equally divided. In the second quarter, both sides wasted many opportunities. Huanan's luck was extremely poor, and they failed to score on several attempts, falling behind. Huanan substituted Shen Pengju for Huang Tianlie, and Qunsheng also substituted Yang Renhui for Cai Lianke. At the end of the first half, the score was 21 to 15, with Qunsheng leading by three goals.</p>
<p>Soaring Straight Up</p>
<p>After changing sides, the game resumed, and Qunsheng's momentum increased. Yang Renhui, Cai Wenzhang, and Cai Wenhua scored three consecutive points. Huanan quickly called a timeout and replaced Huang Tianlie with Li Xianzheng, and then replaced Shen Pengju with Liu Fuqiang, but they still failed to stop the guest team's momentum. The three musketeers, Jinde, Wenhua, and Wenzhang, were successful from all sides, and the score soared straight up. At the end of the third quarter, the score was 40 to 20, with Qunsheng taking the lead. In the final quarter, Huanan showed some improvement, scoring seven consecutive points. Qunsheng called a timeout and substituted Zhu Shirong for Cai Wenhua. Huanan was still rampant for a while. Before long, Cai Lianke fouled out, and Cai Wenzhang entered the game, stabilizing the situation. When the final buzzer sounded, the score was 53 to 37, with Qunsheng winning two consecutive games.</p>

<p>Civil Affairs Briefing</p>
<h3>Please Let All Citizens Take a Look and Supervise the Temple Regulations</h3>
<p>— Zhang Xiaosong</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the city's autonomous organizations at the end of last year, most of them have temporarily borrowed offices from other agencies due to the lack of office space, crowded in a corner, which has affected the promotion of autonomous work. It is difficult to live in borrowed houses for a long time, and there are no houses to move to, and no regulations for renting houses. At this time after the war, when the people's vitality has not yet recovered, how can we expect every autonomous organization to be able to raise funds for construction? Therefore, since the establishment of the district offices, there has hardly been a day without housing problems, and I have been racking my brains for this every day. However, we cannot suspend autonomous work due to the lack of office space. Therefore, the senators, in view of this, proposed to allocate or borrow temples as office space for autonomous organizations. At that time, there were indeed opponents, but the majority supported it. I requested to speak, explaining that this proposal is in line with both reason and law, considering the urgent need to promote autonomous work at present.</p>
<p>Article 4 of the Temple Supervision Regulations stipulates that "Abandoned temples shall be managed by local autonomous bodies." Therefore, if there are temples in this city that meet the requirements of this article, they can be allocated according to law. Article 10 also stipulates that "Temples should, according to their property conditions, engage in public welfare or charitable undertakings," and Article 11 stipulates that "If they violate the provisions of Article 10 (i.e., temples do not engage in public welfare or charitable undertakings), their abbots may be removed." Therefore, the proposal to borrow or allocate temples as housing for autonomous organizations is very much in line with this purpose. Now, the National Government's promulgated Temple Supervision Regulations are published in the newspaper, please let all citizens take a look so that they can understand.</p>
<p>(Article 1) All religious buildings with monks or Taoists residing in them, regardless of their name, are temples. (Article 2) Temples and their properties and religious objects shall be supervised in accordance with these regulations, unless otherwise provided by law. The religious objects mentioned in the preceding paragraph refer to Buddha statues, deity statues, ritual instruments, musical instruments, dharma instruments, classics, carvings, paintings, and all other antiques related to religion, history, or art that have always been preserved by temples. (Article 3) Temples that fall under any of the following categories are not subject to the provisions of these regulations: 1. Those managed by government agencies. 2. Those managed by local public organizations. 3. Those established and managed by private individuals.</p>
<p>(Article 4) Abandoned temples shall be managed by local autonomous bodies. (Article 5) Temple properties and religious objects shall be registered with the local government office in charge. (Article 6) Temple properties and religious objects shall be owned by the temple and managed by the abbot. Monks and Taoists with management rights in the temple, regardless of their title, shall be recognized as abbots, but non-citizens of the Republic of China shall not be abbots. (Article 7) The abbot shall not use the income of the temple property for anything other than propagating religious doctrines, practicing precepts, and other legitimate expenses. (Article 8) Real estate and religious objects of the temple shall not be disposed of or altered without the resolution of the Buddhist Association to which it belongs and the permission of the government office in charge. (Article 9) The abbot shall report the temple's income and expenditure, and the undertakings it engages in, to the government office in charge every six months and make them public.</p>
<p>(Article 10) Temples shall engage in public welfare or charitable undertakings according to their property conditions. (Article 11) Those who violate the provisions of Article 5, Article 6, or Article 10 of these regulations may have their abbots removed from their positions by the government office in charge. Those who violate the provisions of Article 7 or Article 8 may be expelled from the temple or sent to court for investigation. (Article 12) These regulations shall not apply to temples in Tibet, Xikang, Mongolia, and Qinghai. (Article 13) These regulations shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3>Household Registration Personnel Training; Centralized Locations in Districts 4 and 5; Training Postponed</h3>
<p>The municipal government's Civil Affairs Department is organizing centralized training for household registration personnel. The fourth and fifth districts were originally scheduled to hold a four-day training from the 23rd to the 26th of this month. However, due to the investigation of military personnel occupying housing from the 21st to the 25th, all Bao cadres must participate, so the dates of the lectures in these two districts have been changed to the 26th to the 28th for three days. The lecture schedule has also been revised separately, and the department has notified the district offices accordingly.</p>
<p>In addition, the centralized location for the fourth group of household registration personnel training, originally scheduled to be held in the Guanyi Primary School on Qiujiang Road, District 17, has been changed to the auditorium of the Teacher Training Institute at No. 535, Gongping Road, District 18 (north end of Dongyuhang Road) due to the lack of tables and chairs in Guanyi Primary School, which caused many inconveniences.</p>

<h3>Textile Construction Listing Canceled; To Be Handled With Joint Allocation and Sale; Yarn and Cloth Prices Soar, Market Is Quite Chaotic; Both Local and Out-of-Town Sales Are Unusually Active</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's report] The Sixth District Machinery Textile Industry Association convened a meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday. Twenty-nine member units attended, and they decided to cancel the use of the Double Horse brand as the standard for opening yarn during the second group allocation, and instead use 400 pounds of 20-count cotton yarn as the standard. At the same time, the members discussed the sharing method for the yarn allocation. As for the various procedures for opening yarn, there was not much change from before.</p>
<p>In addition, since the China Textile Construction Company decided to cancel the original weekly Monday, Wednesday, and Friday morning listing and allocation system, it has been merged into the Joint Allocation and Sale Committee for unified handling, in order to streamline the process. Therefore, the yarn opening situation of Textile Construction in the future will be delayed until 4:00 or 5:00 PM every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday before the details are known. It is said that the Textile Company convened a meeting yesterday afternoon to change the allocation and sale system, and the discussion lasted quite a long time.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market rose crazily. Because transactions in various places were smooth and out-of-town merchants collected spot goods in a particularly eager manner, the yarn price was already extremely hot. In addition, Textile Construction announced the futures allocation price at night, raising it by 60,000 to 190,000 [including 32-count Blue Phoenix, which increased by 60,000, and 20-count and 42-count, which increased by 180,000 to 190,000], which excited people's hearts. It was like adding fuel to the fire, and the rise had the feeling of soaring to the sky, generally rising by about 10%. It is said that yesterday, in addition to the northern road sales still surging and out-of-town sales being smooth, local weaving factories in this city also purchased raw materials one after another to compensate for the shortage of gray fabric they had sold, which has presented a situation of unequal supply and demand. Moreover, the previous Textile Construction yarn opening suddenly changed its policy and decided to sell yarn jointly with commercial factories, increasing prices uniformly. The market price it opened yesterday also soared by 10,000, which led to a jump in market prices and panic among people. In summary, the price of 20-count standard yarn rose by more than 10,000 yuan, to about 1.7 million yuan, and 42-count was more than 2.4 million yuan. The market atmosphere is still looking up.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of cotton cloth jumped crazily, and people's hearts were panicked. In recent days, the out-of-town merchants have been moving quite vigorously, and the ban on shipping to South China may be lifted. The market situation had already become firm. However, after the out-of-town sales had been active for several days, the appetite gradually subsided, and the market could have temporarily stabilized. Yesterday's soaring was really due to the change in Textile Construction's opening price. Yanghe fine cloth was 63,000 yuan, which was 10,000 yuan higher than the same grade of five fine cloth opened in the previous period. People's hearts were stimulated by this. At the same time, various gray fabric factories dared not release much because the previous futures had not been cleared, while dyeing factories and this street were searching more eagerly. With the imbalance between supply and demand, the market situation became even more chaotic. Today's opening price for 3A color ball fine cloth is 72,000 yuan, and old goods Four Gentlemen serge is 76,500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Three Points Should Be Improved for Yarn Allocation; Yarn and Cloth Approval for Southward Transportation Must Be Fair</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's report] Yesterday, the supply situation of yarn and cloth and the market situation both underwent drastic changes. The relevant parties are paying close attention. According to Mr. Pan Shihao, the person in charge of the cotton textile reproduction industry, this kind of change was expected and there is no need to be surprised. He also said that the supply method is being discussed with the authorities for improvement, and the market should gradually stabilize. According to him, the joint sale of goods by private yarn mills under the control of Textile Construction was originally a proper measure, but there are three points that need to be improved: [1] Futures are sold, but the full payment must be collected. In these days of no industrial loans and tight monetary conditions, it is necessary to consider both and make appropriate adjustments. [2] The price is not opened until the purchase orders are collected, which is inconsistent with trading practices. According to the method, those who withdraw their purchase after submitting it will have their qualifications revoked in the future. Then, how should it be handled when the price is not suitable? And it is also inconvenient to collect orders during the day and open the price at night. [3] Futures warehouse receipts must be cleared within a limited time, otherwise, it will only be enough to create a snowball trade. He also said that in the month since Textile Construction distributed goods after the exchange rate change, although it seemed to maintain the original price on the surface, changing the brand and increasing the premium had already been brewing a price increase. And in terms of the general market price, the low price reduction has indeed made it sacrifice a lot of profits. Now that it has obtained control over the joint sales of private yarn mills, it is understandable to cancel the equal distribution of cotton yarn and follow the prices of commercial factories, but it is a pity that the supply method has also followed the same path. Moreover, in terms of the current selling price of Textile Construction, Yanghe fine cloth is listed at 63,000 yuan, which is 10,000 yuan higher than a month ago, and more than 8,000 times higher than before the war. In order to stabilize prices, effective measures must be taken urgently to avoid further stimulation. It is not a good strategy for the cotton textile reproduction industry to search for purchases on the black market due to insufficient raw materials. Proper preparations should be made for the aftermath. As for the ban on the transportation of yarn and cloth to South China, according to Mr. Pan, lifting the ban is inevitable, but under the system of applying for approval, attention should be paid to the preservation of private production institutions. Textile Construction has now gained control over the yarn and cloth market, which is gratifying. However, the Textile Committee, which controls the approval mechanism, should take a broader view and take fair measures for the approval of southward transportation of yarn and cloth in the future.</p>
<h3>New Banknotes</h3>
<p>1,180 boxes were shipped from Liverpool yesterday</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's report] The Taikoo Blue Funnel managed by the Glensturil, Enteel, and our bank's vessel Simjack, shipped a large batch of legal tender from Liverpool, totaling 1,180 boxes, which have already been extracted separately.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rate Rumors; Authorities Will Investigate the Cause</h3>
<p>In recent days, rumors have suddenly spread here again that the exchange rate will be adjusted, which has no factual basis. The authorities are very angry about this. President Song today rested at his residence on Qiqi Road due to his political health not yet being fully recovered, but he met with many bankers and also inquired about these rumors. It is said that he will order his subordinates to investigate the cause of these rumors.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Weak</h3>
<p>There were still some scattered sales of government bonds, and they fell slightly after trading at more than 3 million. Tong Bing opened in the morning at 2,000 yuan, rose slightly to a maximum of 2,050 yuan, and then fell again, retreating to a price of 1,840 yuan. The price stabilized slightly near the close, and the result was a drop of 110 yuan compared to the previous close. Jia and Yi each fell by 50 yuan, and Ding and Wu fell slightly by 20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Lack Change</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks saw a decline in large-cap stocks, and small-cap stocks saw some Westerners collecting them, showing a slight increase. Large-cap stocks fell slightly after the opening, but lacked major changes. The results compared to the previous close were that British-related Jardine Matheson, Ewo, Wheelock, and A.S. Watson fell slightly, while the steel, shipping, and paper industries rose slightly, and Ye Guang was flat.</p>
<h3>Many Settlements, Yarn Prices Rise, Gold and Currency Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>The yesterday was still encouraged by the US dollar, initially flat and then popular, putting the Central Bank in a difficult situation. The morning opening immediately fell slightly to 2.168 million. The Central Bank had some control, and it weakened immediately after the opening, once retreating to within 2.15 million. Soon after, the US dollar followed closely, and buying interest rose again, gradually rebounding. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 183 bars, and the price also rose with the market to 2.1725 million. After entering, it once rose to 2.178 million before being suppressed and gradually consolidated. It once fell slightly to 2.16 million near noon, struggling around 2.165 million at noon. In the afternoon, retail investors heard that Textile Construction had raised yarn prices and started to stir again, once rising to more than 2.2 million, and then slightly rebounded, then rising another 13,000. Ornaments, gold, and silver were unchanged, the selling price of silver dollars increased slightly, and the underground discount rate for money was still high, with the interest rate still only about 13%.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies also followed the US dollar and trended towards profitability. The US dollar opened in the morning, still because the gold price was controlled, there were still some sales. There was supply at 3,680 yuan, and it fell to below 3,600 yuan shortly after the opening before it was maintained. Settlements then came to purchase, and it was immediately raised. Retail investors came to chase after, and buying momentum rose again, rising to 3,750 yuan before there was any stopping. It fell to 3,650 yuan at noon, but still stabilized above 3,700 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, because it was Saturday, competition for purchases was even more intense, and the price rose to 3,870 yuan before slightly returning. The result was a continued increase of 70 yuan compared to the previous close. The exchange rate against gold was slightly fixed at about 578 yuan per ten taels. Hong Kong dollars followed suit and rose by 20 yuan. The selling price of Hong Kong exchange rates rose from 740 yuan to 750 yuan with no supply for demand. The Indian exchange rate rose from 870 yuan to over 900 yuan. The British exchange rate was around 12,000 yuan, and there were no transactions for the US exchange rate because the listed price had not changed.</p>
<h3>Bulls Selling High, Chinese Stocks Difficult to Rise</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks still followed the old path of the past few days in the morning, showing glory in the upper market, but only for half an hour. Generally, bulls continued to sell high one after another, and the lifting surface could not support it. After 10:30, it returned to the lower reaches. The rising winds of materials rose sharply, and speculative funds tended to hoard goods. Therefore, those who left stocks to seek goods continued to operate, and the market price declined in each section, becoming worse and worse, and it was difficult to revive. Only China Silk had No. 190 and No. 151 competing to buy each other, and it turned out to be transferred slightly. Other stocks had no way. There were more sales near the afternoon. When the bank came to enter at the close, the United States came to a slight settlement. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yongsheng Yarn and Jingfu were flat, and Meiya Xinguang and Qinxing fell slightly. Among the unpopular stocks, only Lian'an fell by half a percent, and the rest all fell slightly. The total transaction volume was 4,744,000 shares, including 1,560,000 shares of Yongsheng Yarn, 978,000 shares of Jingfu, 917,000 shares of Xinguang, 218,000 shares of Meiya, and other stocks generally ranged from tens of thousands of shares to tens of thousands of shares. Outside the market, most stocks were weak and flat.</p>
<h3>New Hopes for International Trade: Price Stability and Improved Transportation</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 20th] American businesses are closely monitoring China's efforts to level the significant trade imbalance. In recent months, China's exports have only reached 20% of its imports, and foreign exchange reserves are dwindling daily. The future of Sino-American trade seemed bleak. However, two recent developments have sparked new hope: the Chinese government's abolition of export taxes and the nearly 50% devaluation of Chinese currency in the past month. Additionally, American merchants have observed two other favorable signs: relatively stable prices in the Chinese market and the improving Chinese transportation system.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Remain High Despite Abundant Supply; Flour and Wheat Sales Are Strong, Market Trend Rising</h3>
<p>The rice market yesterday saw prices soar by 2,000 yuan in the early market due to high costs in the producing areas caused by rain. The closing market was sluggish. As a result, Du Yang, 秞, and Zha rose by 1,000 yuan, while Ke 秞 and Bu 秞 remained flat. White Yuan also saw little fluctuation. Glutinous rice was very firm. Registered rice from both north and south markets totaled over 11,000 stones. Flour sales were exceptionally brisk, with demand exceeding supply, causing prices to surge by 700 to 800 yuan. The Min gang of wheat showed strong interest, with prices rising by 600 to 700 yuan. Wheat bran prices were steadily climbing, continuing to rise by 200 to 300 yuan. High-quality soybeans saw prices increase by 1,000 yuan, while medium and lower grades remained stable. Raw peanuts from Nanyang were actively sought, and local retail sales were also brisk, continuing to rise by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. High-quality soybeans saw a price cut. The oil market saw mixed ups and downs. The supply of Qingdao raw oil was abundant, causing prices to fall by 1,000 yuan. Soybean oil was scarce, with prices rising by 1,000 yuan. Vegetable oil also tended to stabilize, while soybean cakes showed a slightly firm trend.</p>
<h3>Long Positions Meet High Offers; Chinese Stocks Struggle to Rise</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks opened this morning following the same pattern as the previous few days, showing initial gains. Unfortunately, this lasted only half an hour, as long positions gradually met high offers. The bullish side was unable to sustain the momentum, and after 10:30 AM, the market trended downward again. The surge in commodity prices led speculative funds to seek hoarding opportunities, causing those selling stocks to seek goods, leading to a gradual decline in market prices, worsening with each passing session, and failing to recover. Only China Silk Stocks No. 190 and No. 151, due to competition in purchasing, saw a reversal, while other stocks had no such luck. Near noon, there was renewed selling, with large quantities of American Asian Stocks being sold at No. 233. As the closing bell approached, investors needing funds came in, slightly stabilizing American Asian stocks. In the end, compared to the previous close, Yong Yarn and Jingfu were flat, while American Asian, New Light, and Qinxing saw slight declines. Among the less popular stocks, only the silk industry saw a gain of half a percent, standing out like a crane among chickens, while the rest saw slight declines. China Textile No. 5 and Heping were flat, while Tongyi, Datong, Vulgar People, and Arlene fell by half a percent, and the rest saw slight declines. The total transaction volume was 4,744,000 shares, including 1,560,000 shares of Yong Yarn, 978,000 shares of Jingfu, 917,000 shares of New Light, and 218,000 shares of American Asian. The remaining stocks traded from tens of thousands to approximately 120,000 shares each. Off-market stocks were mostly weak.</p>
<h3>Chen Chou Zhen Tea, Needed in Africa, Order Signed</h3>
<p>There is continued demand for Chen Chou Zhen and Chen Te Gong tea varieties, and the market is seeing strong sales. A certain tea company in the city has recently received a telegram from Africa requesting Chen Chou Zhen tea, requesting shipments. However, the supplier, seeing no profit, was hesitant. Later, to encourage exports, they became more accommodating. It is said that the two sides have signed a contract, and the goods are expected to be delivered next month. As for domestic sales of red and green tea, stores in this city and in Suzhou and Wuxi are still very brisk. Coarse-haired Wenzhou red tea, in particular, is selling out as soon as it becomes available, with prices exceeding 60,000 yuan per dan, and other teas are also trending strongly.</p>
<h3>Measures for Handling Enemy and Puppet Trademarks; Trademark Bureau Formulates Three Key Points</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] It is reported that the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in order to streamline the procedures for handling enemy and puppet trademarks in the recovered areas, has formulated three points for handling cases, which have been submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval. The details of these measures are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) All trademarks examined, approved, and registered by enemy or puppet organizations in the recovered areas, regardless of nationality, are invalid. (2) Trademark registration certificates, examination decisions, or review decisions on disputes issued by enemy or puppet organizations, as well as related public documents, shall not be used as evidence to assert usage or other rights under the Trademark Law. (3) Chinese and foreign merchants holding registration certificates or examination decisions issued by the central government's trademark registration authorities that have been examined and stamped or otherwise annotated by enemy or puppet organizations, or documents issued by them, should immediately submit them to the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for verification and reissuance.</p>
<h3>Economic Zoning System; Shanghai Listed as Fourth Zone</h3>
<p>According to Wu Chengluo, a representative of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the government is actively implementing a national regional economic system and expects to put it into practice soon. The locations of the zones are as follows: Zone 1, starting from Dalian, includes the nine northeastern provinces; Zone 2, starting from Tianjin, includes Hebei, Chahar, and Shanxi; Zone 3, starting from Qingdao, includes Shandong, Henan, and Shaanxi; Zone 4, starting from Shanghai, includes Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui; Zone 5, starting from Taipei, includes Fujian, Taiwan, and Penghu Islands; Zone 6, starting from Kowloon, includes Guangdong and Guangxi; Zone 7, starting from Haiphong, includes Yunnan, Guizhou, and northern Annam; Zone 8, starting from Hankou, includes Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi; Zone 9, starting from Chongqing, includes Sichuan, Xikang, Guizhou, and the southwestern regions. Industrial supervisors will be assigned to each zone.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Increases Fees for Certifying Consular Invoices</h3>
<p>Jianghai Customs has received a telegram from the Customs General Administration, effective immediately, increasing the fees for merchants applying for reissue of consular invoices to 50,250 yuan; the fee for holders of blue duplicates is increased to 16,750 yuan. The original fees for these invoices were 30,300 yuan, and 10,100 yuan for holders of blue duplicates.</p>
<h3>Japan Refuses to Export Surplus Fresh Cocoons; Our Side Renews Negotiations; Supreme Command's Investigation and Statistics are Inaccurate</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Recently, a United Press dispatch from Tokyo reported that the Allied Supreme Commander in Japan has refused to export surplus fresh cocoons to our country. A reporter inquired with a responsible person from the China Silk Company, who said: China believes that Japan has a large surplus of fresh cocoons, while China is in short supply. Therefore, in April of this year, China first proposed exchanging this batch of cocoons with Japan through barter trade, but without success. Three weeks ago, the same request was made again and is still under verbal negotiation. It is reported that there are three reasons for the US side's delay in approving the request: (1) They believe that China currently has 80,000 dan of cocoons in storage, which is sufficient for the second half of this year. (2) Labor costs in Shanghai are high, and there are frequent strikes, so even if the surplus cocoons are approved, they may not be able to produce silk in large quantities. Moreover, even if silk is produced, the quality may not be good. (3) Shanghai's fuel problem is serious, with shortages of both coal and diesel. According to the responsible person: the reasons given by the US side are all due to inaccurate investigations. It is estimated that this year's autumn cocoon harvest in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces will not exceed 20,000 dan. The silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have a total of 10,500 silk reeling machines. In order to maintain operation until the spring silk season next year, at least 10 million pounds of cocoons are required, equivalent to 75,000 dan. Otherwise, all silk factories will shut down. As for the labor unrest, it has recently eased and will not affect silk production. Moreover, the quality of China's silk is very high. 95% of the silk inspected for export by the Commodity Inspection Bureau meets export standards. There is also no shortage of fuel, and the silk industry is currently approved by the government to purchase coal, diesel, and other fuels. The person also stated: During the war, the cocoon and mulberry equipment in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces was destroyed by Japanese invaders. The issue of compensation has not yet been discussed, and instead, China is using urgently needed Chinese goods to exchange for Japan's surplus fresh cocoons. Therefore, this request is reasonable. Therefore, General Zhu Shiming has again approached the Allied Supreme Commander to negotiate the exchange of cocoons. The person said: It is hoped that the US side will conduct a thorough investigation to avoid being misled by distorted information. The person also believes that after verifying all the facts, there will be no problem in shipping Japanese cocoons to China.</p>
<h3>Stamp Tax on Remittance Receipts; Should be Affixed According to Item 15 of the Stamp Tax Rate</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance on July 8 of this year, stating that the remittance receipts issued by recipients of remittances were explained by Ruan Hui to the Ministry of Finance before the war. It was explained that these receipts are issued by the recipients and are different in nature from checks, drafts, and promissory notes issued by banks, money shops, and other businesses for drawing money. They should be stamped at the rate for money receipts, not at the rate for money documents for drawing or remitting money. The Ministry of Finance approved this and circulated it throughout the country. The request inquired whether this interpretation has changed and requested clarification for compliance. The Chamber of Commerce has now received a reply from the Ministry of Finance stating that the remittance receipts issued by recipients of remittances should be stamped according to Item 15 of the revised stamp tax law rate, which is the example of documents or ledgers for drawing or remitting money (20 yuan per document, 100 yuan per ledger). The Chamber of Commerce will inform all associations and businesses to follow the instructions.</p>
<h3>Flour Industry in Crisis; Urges Stabilization of Wheat Prices</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Fourth District Flour Industry Association held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday to discuss ways to save the current flour industry crisis. The directors and supervisors agreed that the current production cost of flour is too high, and small factories are closing down one after another, while large factories are also gradually shutting down. Even if flour exports are decontrolled, the price limit on flour still does not help manufacturers. If wheat prices are not stabilized, flour production in the city will only continue to decline. It is predicted that half of the flour factories will close by the end of this year. Therefore, the most important measure at present is to request the government to stabilize wheat prices.</p>
<h3>White Coal Chunks Soar Again</h3>
<p>In the coal market, white coal chunks, although the price is high, due to the lack of hope of delivery, suppliers are few, buyers are eager, and the market price continues to soar. Yangquan screened chunks are priced at 650,000 yuan per ton, and there are few sellers. Smoked coal and coke are also rising due to the increase in the price of white coal chunks. Clear water coal and coke are as high as 600,000 yuan per ton, and ordinary Jingxing coke also requires 330,000 to 340,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Salt Merchants Request Postponement of Implementation of Merchant Transportation and Sales Method</h3>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, the government controlled the official transportation and merchant sales of salt. Now that the war has ended, there is no need to continue the controls. The Ministry of Finance previously issued an order to salt merchants in various regions, scheduling the change of the above method starting from January of the 36th year of the Republic, restoring merchant transportation and sales. However, salt merchants generally suffered significant losses during the control period, and their vitality has not yet recovered. If merchant transportation and sales are implemented, capital turnover will inevitably be difficult. They have jointly submitted a request to the salt affairs authorities to postpone the implementation for two years.</p>
<h3>Timber Market Turns Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the timber market saw firmer conditions. Although fir wood arrived, the unloading of fir wood shipped by Da Zhonghua was delayed, and sellers were unwilling to sell at low prices due to increased costs. However, market demand was also not high, so prices remained firm.</p>
<h3>Asphalt Gradually Declines</h3>
<p>Asphalt prices rose sharply before the festival, but the momentum has weakened after the festival. Initially, the hot weather made loading and unloading difficult, and the supply was scarce. Recently, shipments from various places have gathered, causing the market to decline. As for inventories in various production areas, eastern Zhejiang has long been depleted, and even if there are shipments in the autumn, there will not be many. However, dealers in Jinlan, Hangzhou, and other places cannot accommodate many shipments, selling them as soon as they arrive, with Shanghai as the final destination. Therefore, shipments continue to arrive in this city. As for Hankou, after the goods stored by merchants in this city were continuously shipped to Shanghai, transporters also brought shipments, and the situation gradually became peaceful. Dealers have adjusted their selling prices. Heben oil is priced at 142,000 yuan, Neiping oil at 134,000 yuan, Longjian at 130,000 yuan, Deqian oil at 126,000 yuan, Jianmacheng oil at 116,000 yuan, and ordinary Macheng oil at 110,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>The Only Way to Lower Current Interest Rates</h3>
<p>— Cao Yong'an, Xufeng Pawnshop</p>
<p>Is to Obtain Low-Interest Loans from Banks</p>
<p>The pawnshop industry has a long history and is the only financial institution for the common people. Therefore, even small profits are not considered offensive by officials. Although they know they are taking profits from the people, the poor are still happy to use them. Today, pawnshop business is sluggish, mainly because interest rates are too high, and the poor cannot afford them. They have no way to borrow money and cannot cope with urgent needs, which is not good for society. Outsiders do not understand this situation and simply blame the pawnshop industry for reducing interest rates. However, with high borrowing rates and excessive expenses, why would shareholders engage in this loss-making business? Therefore, to help the common people, we must maintain pawnshops. To maintain pawnshops, we must enable the pawnshop industry to obtain low-interest funds. I believe that national or municipal banks should reduce interest rates and lend to pawnshops, and then require the pawnshop association to reduce pawnshop interest rates and enforce them. The pawnshop association should be responsible for reviewing and reporting the organization, financial strength, and management of each pawnshop. The bank should provide low-interest loans, and the association should be responsible for supervision. In this way, the loans will not be wasted and can be supported, and the poor can also enjoy the benefits. I have been in this industry for only a short time, but I know that if there are no low-interest funds internally, there is no possibility of reducing interest rates externally. The common people and the pawnshop industry can only suffer from this problem. I have taken the liberty of expressing my humble opinion, hoping that experts will provide guidance.</p>

<h3>A New Trial for Two Great Nations: Chinese Sovereignty in Hong Kong (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Ling Fang</p>
<p>Hong Kong Airmail, 19th of this month</p>
<p>After eight years of the War of Resistance and World War II, the status of the Chinese nation in the world has been reassessed. Our policy of peace radiates a special light on the international stage. We have not bullied anyone, let alone committed aggression. On the contrary, regarding any past injustices inflicted upon us, we still adhere to the traditional spirit of peace, seeking to establish understanding with the other party. We clearly understand the difficulties of others. We also know that the accumulated habits of the past, not to mention that the party that has taken advantage of us cannot change overnight, many of our "soft bones" also find it difficult to stand up straight at once. As long as the other party can recognize this new transformation, which is undeniable in both reason and emotion, and treat us with an attitude of equality and mutual benefit, we will never deliberately bring up old scores or make things difficult for others. This fact is even more evident in the Hong Kong issue.</p>
<p>Today, enlightened people all over the world recognize that the Hong Kong issue is the crystallization of a century of stains on Sino-British relations. To ensure a new post-war friendship with China, enlightened British people have long advocated returning Hong Kong to China. However, the transformation of British foreign policy has not kept pace with the transformation of the international situation, and the Hong Kong issue has become a focal point of Sino-British relations. The new aspirations of the Chinese side and the old inclinations of the British side have come into direct contact with Hong Kong as a medium. Since the British army re-entered Hong Kong a year ago, Sino-British forces have clashed due to various unavoidable factors. Small incidents are countless, and there have been several major ones, as I have previously reported in summary. I would like to take this opportunity to clarify a point: Standing on the position of reporting, I have no partiality for my own country and no ill will towards our ally, Britain. Recently, the reason why I have tirelessly reported on the Hong Kong issue, especially on the unpleasant events caused by both China and Britain, is on the one hand to meet the demands of domestic readers who are paying attention to the Hong Kong issue, and on the other hand to seek correction from international people who care about Sino-British relations. Every time I pick up my pen, I deeply hope that this small island of Hong Kong will become the cornerstone of a new friendship between the two great nations of China and Britain, rather than a battleground for the new forces of the two great nations. This turning point relies on a lot of effort on the Chinese side, but it seems to rely more on the effort of the British side. Recently, in the new environment of Hong Kong, the following</p>
<p>Unpleasant Sino-British Incidents</p>
<p>There are two more: the negotiations on the establishment of a Chinese court in Kowloon and the negotiations on the establishment of a government in Kowloon City. The former was revealed on July 29, and the latter occurred in early September, reaching a conclusion only when the Hong Kong government issued a statement on the 14th. When the news of the negotiations on the establishment of a court in Kowloon was released, I did not report it at the time for the sake of Sino-British friendship, because the official announcement had not yet been made. Unexpectedly, one wave has not subsided, and the issue of establishing a government in Kowloon City has risen again. These two issues are related to Sino-British treaties and sovereignty, and are long-standing unresolved cases. The matter has developed to the present, and after careful consideration, I believe that reporting is necessary.</p>
<p>The Kowloon City issue was already a topic of national discussion during the time when Gan Jiehou and Zu Ren were special envoys for foreign affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi before the war. Sino-British exchanges and negotiations were frequent, but there was no result. It was not until the outbreak of the War of Resistance that it came to a standstill. According to the Convention Between Great Britain and China Respecting an Extension of Hong Kong Territory, signed on June 9, 1898, although Kowloon City is located within the leased territory of the New Territories, its sovereignty still belongs to China. The treaty clearly stipulates: "The Chinese officials now stationed in Kowloon City shall continue to exercise their functions there, provided that they do not interfere with the military requirements of the defence of Hong Kong." It was also agreed: "It is further agreed that the old jetty near Kowloon City shall be reserved for the convenience of Chinese men-of-war, merchant and passenger vessels, boats and junks, as well as for the convenience of Chinese officials and citizens." The original residents of Kowloon City, by virtue of the above provisions, settled down, not subject to British law, and not paying taxes to the Hong Kong government, for a period of two or three decades. After 1931, the British began to release information about demolishing the city walls and building roads, ordering the original residents (there were hundreds of households) to move out. The residents elected representatives to seek assistance in Guangzhou, and the Kowloon City issue arose from this point. Kowloon City belongs to the jurisdiction of Xin'an County (known as Xin'an County in the Qing Dynasty, Kowloon City is the walled city of Jiulong Division of Xin'an County). Although the treaty stipulates that it is still territory under our country's sovereignty, it is a small place that has long been forgotten by the Chinese people. The original Tonghai Pier (named Longjin Pier) has been filled in due to British land reclamation projects. It is surrounded by leased territory. The city walls are built on a mountain (see circle). There is very little flat land in the city, only two official buildings and one civilian alley. At most, it is like a small village. If the Hong Kong government had complied with the treaty and allowed the residents to live in the city in peace, our authorities would have had no reason to make a fuss or cause trouble. Kowloon City is located in the foothills of the mountains and does not hinder traffic. Why did the British suddenly want to demolish the city walls and build roads when they were living in peace and harmony? It is already incomprehensible. Later, they forced the residents to move out, and were willing to choose another location to build a "new village" for the residents in exchange for their original properties in the city, which is especially unpredictable. At that time, some residents fell for the "inducement and threats" and abandoned their original homes in the city, moving to the "new village" built by the British. However, a small number of people who understood the righteousness could not bear to separate from their ancestral homes that had been passed down from generation to generation, and they were still reluctant to leave. The special envoy for foreign affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi was ordered to negotiate with the Hong Kong government again and again. Although the British demolished some of the houses of those who had moved away, they never dared to demolish the city forcefully. This city that the British were hesitant to</p>
<p>Demolish</p>
<p>Was completely demolished by the Japanese invaders when they invaded Hong Kong in order to develop the Kai Tak Airport outside the city. Kowloon City has been destroyed twice by the British and Japanese, and its appearance has been completely changed. A house that was converted from the former government office into a home for the elderly was renovated by Christians before the war and has now become the only complete building left in the city. Next to it is a free school, which is now dilapidated and about to collapse. All other places are overgrown with weeds and roads are indistinguishable. After the war, in order to ensure sovereignty over the southern border, the Bao'an County authorities, in accordance with the treaty, reported to the Guangdong Provincial Government and the Commissioner's Office for Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi. The Guangdong Provincial Government then reported to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They personally planned to establish a law in Kowloon City. Telegrams and letters were exchanged for many months. Recently, the county authorities received a reply from the higher authorities approving the plan and specially sent the chief of the Civil Affairs Section of the county government to Hong Kong to discuss with the Commissioner's Office for Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi. As soon as this news was published in the Hong Kong newspapers, the Kowloon City issue was excavated from the memory of the general public. However, this time it has changed from preventing the demolition of the city to negotiating the establishment of a government, which just happened to be published in the newspapers shortly after the news that our government was conducting negotiations with the British on the establishment of a Chinese court in Kowloon. The overseas Chinese could not help but feel a deep yearning for the sovereignty that they had lost. The Xinsheng Evening News of September 14 published a special issue on the establishment of a government in Kowloon City, exploring the issue systematically from a historical perspective.</p>
<p>When this incident had already aroused an unusual reaction among the overseas Chinese, because the "diplomatic position" of our diplomatic mission in Hong Kong had not yet made an official statement, the spokesman of the Hong Kong government issued an official statement on the issue of Kowloon City governance within three hours after the publication of the special issue of the Xinsheng Evening News. We interpret the same treaty as the sovereignty of Kowloon City still belonging to our country. However, the Hong Kong government believes that "in fact, the wording and tone of the treaty do not coincide with the intention of not including Kowloon City." Therefore, "during the lease period, Kowloon City has become part of the expanded territory of the United Kingdom and is subject to British sovereignty." It further explained that "in 1899, the exercise of legal rights by Chinese officials in Kowloon City was no longer compatible with the military needs of the defence of Hong Kong, and therefore the exercise of these legal rights was terminated."</p>
<p>After the Hong Kong government's statement was issued, right and wrong were determined by reviewing the original text of the treaty. The next day, the Xinbao Newspaper's commentary, titled "The Kowloon City Issue," "corrected the original text of the treaty" to the Hong Kong government, believing that "what the Hong Kong government spokesman said seems to be somewhat far-fetched," because "there is only the 1898 treaty regarding the Kowloon City issue, and there have been no other changes since then." The Hong Kong government's statement, "it is not known what other basis there is?" The newspaper made a heartfelt conclusion, saying: "In such close Sino-British friendship, we believe that the words of general spokesmen need to be prudent. Otherwise, misunderstandings will be trapped in misunderstandings, and it will be difficult to resolve them."</p>
<p>On the 15th, the Xinsheng Evening News published a commentary titled "The Hong Kong Government's Statement on Kowloon City," saying: "Although the treaty at the time did not explicitly stipulate that the land rights within the Kowloon City area were outside the scope of the Kowloon leased territory, the legal governance rights within the city were clearly stipulated to be retained by the Chinese side... We are willing to seek the correctness of the facts... We are not satisfied with the Hong Kong government's statement... This issue of the Kowloon Lease Treaty is related to Hong Kong itself, and also to the Sino-British allies. We hope and expect a word from our diplomatic authorities to dispel doubts and correct misunderstandings."</p>

<h3>Regarding Temple Issues</h3>
<p>Concerning the Shanghai Municipal Council's passage of "Appropriating Temples," which led to a petition from Shanghai's monks requesting reconsideration and revocation, Tai Xu is currently ill and recuperating. Moreover, the Shanghai incident can be addressed by the Buddhist Association requesting the wisdom of the Municipal Council and the Municipal Government, so he did not intervene. After reading the "Why Must Temples and Monks Misunderstand?" editorial in your esteemed newspaper on the 21st, the concluding remarks mention Tai Xu, mistakenly praising me as a wise man. Overwhelmed with shame and gratitude, I must address some humble opinions while ill, and request that you publish them.</p>
<p>(1) The original article states, "Since the Republic of China, it has been common practice everywhere to borrow Buddhist halls for schools." This follows the flawed policies of the Qing Dynasty, evolving into a bad habit. Since the 20th year of the Republic of China, the central government has repeatedly issued prohibitions, but it is still difficult to curb this "evil trend." How can this be encouraged again? (2) The Temple Supervision Regulations were established by the Legislative Yuan in 1929, concerning Buddhist and Taoist temples in the mainland. The law clearly stipulates that "temple property belongs to the temple" – (private corporate entity) – managed by the abbot – (legal representative) – and cannot be altered without the resolution of the affiliated religious association (such as the Buddhist Association for Buddhist temples) and approval from the Ministry of Interior. Therefore, temple property clearly belongs to the "private property of a private corporate entity or private social organization." Public, but public only within its corporate or social structure, like Buddhist temples, Catholic churches, Christian churches, and Muslim mosques. (3) The Temple Supervision Regulations require Buddhist temples to engage in charitable and public welfare activities, encouraging Buddhist monks to initiate these activities voluntarily. Tai Xu, through the Chinese Buddhist Association, has repeatedly advised religious associations and temples in various provinces, cities, and counties to initiate these activities voluntarily, and many have already done so. Previously, the Ministry of Interior established the Implementation Measures for Temples Engaging in Charitable and Public Welfare Activities. The Ministry of Education also involved a clause on encouraging the use of ancestral halls and temples for establishing primary schools in counties and townships. Some provinces or counties, based on this, have enacted separate regulations or illegally occupied Buddhist temples and seized monastic property. Recently, the Reorganization Committee of the Chinese Buddhist Association, addressing these malpractices, consulted and petitioned the Ministry of Social Affairs, which then forwarded it to the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan has already approved the revocation of the Implementation Measures for Temples Engaging in Charitable and Public Welfare Activities, the Ministry of Education's clause on encouraging the use of Buddhist temples for primary schools in counties and townships, and certain provincial or county regulations concerning "infringement of temple rights." The approval was issued two months ago, and it is assumed that the governments of various provinces, cities, and counties have already been informed of the Executive Yuan's approval. (4) When local autonomous organizations lack office space, there are many ways to appropriate local public buildings, utilize public land for construction, or rent private houses. Buddhist temples, like Catholic churches, are "private property of private corporate entities or private social organizations." Appropriating Buddhist temples is no different from appropriating private property of the people. (5) Although it is explained that "appropriation refers to Confucian temples, Yue Fei temples, and other temples dedicated to sages, or city god temples and other local deity temples, or abandoned temples without owners as defined in the Temple Supervision Regulations, these should be discussed separately," for religious temples such as Buddhist temples, borrowing should be considered. Furthermore, the assertion that Buddhist temples are built with collective funds and therefore belong to local public property is also incorrect. As for requesting a lease, it should be the same as leasing private property of ordinary people. Why specifically single out temples for borrowing, creating room for forced borrowing? To quell the city's monks' shock, anger, fear, and anxiety, I urge the wise authorities of the Municipal Council and the Municipal Government to take the following actions swiftly: (1) The Municipal Council should reconsider the "appropriating or borrowing temples" clause, revising it to "appropriating city god temples or abandoned temples without owners." As for requesting a lease, the person seeking the lease should negotiate with the property owner for consent. (2) The Municipal Government should immediately order those forcibly occupying temples to evacuate, to avoid causing constant fear and anxiety among all the monks and temples in the city. Your esteemed newspaper holds the leading position in public opinion, admired by millions. May it guide the monks and temples of the city to stability, so that they can promote the Buddha's great compassion, serve society, and assist in civil governance. I humbly request your esteemed newspaper to correct and guide me. Sincerely, Tai Xu, September 21st</p>
<h3>Weekly Forum: People Who Oppose Atomic Warfare</h3>
<p>— Yuan Dazhong</p>
<p>Those who understand the benefits and harms of atomic warfare invariably oppose it; however, the psychology and effects of their opposition are not uniform. If analyzed, they can be divided into the following three types:</p>
<p>The first type of people neither possesses atomic bombs nor hopes to possess them, and certainly does not hope that others possess them either. They not only oppose atomic warfare, but also oppose all wars. Therefore, they not only do not have any intention or preparation for atomic warfare, but also possess few weapons of any kind for use in war. They can be said to be truly peace-loving; however, how much power do they possess to maintain peace? It is very, very little! Once they encounter the invasion of "barbarians," how will they defend themselves against violence to preserve the lives of their nation and maintain peace for the world? They have no confidence in themselves. At the same time, the ambition of the barbaric invaders is strengthened, and they regard this group of peace-lovers as a delicious and easily acquired prize.</p>
<p>The second type of people already possess atomic bombs, but they do not approve of aggression. Therefore, although they possess this particularly fierce weapon, they do not hope to use it; although they do not hope to use it, they cannot help but prepare for it, lest it be used by others. They are just as peace-loving as the first type of people, but they also have the power to maintain peace; they not only do not allow themselves to invade, but also do not allow others to invade. Therefore, they are often the sworn enemies of aggressors, seeing them as thorns in their eyes and splinters in their flesh.</p>
<p>The third type of people hope that they themselves will possess atomic bombs, while also fearing that others will possess atomic bombs, and even more fearing that others will possess atomic bombs before them. Therefore, they desperately encourage domestic research into atomic bombs and the manufacture of atomic bombs, regarding atomic bombs as their first life, even to the point of neglecting sleep and meals, and being willing to sacrifice everything to obtain this most lethal weapon, even resorting to theft, robbery, deception, and every possible trick to seize atomic bombs from others' hands. However, at the same time, before they have definitely obtained atomic bombs, they are also there opposing atomic bombs and atomic warfare. During the period when they have not yet possessed atomic bombs, they are of course at the forefront of opposing atomic warfare; once they obtain atomic bombs, it is difficult to say whether they will still oppose atomic warfare. They merely advocate that atomic bombs should be openly shared, which is different from abolishing atomic bombs altogether. They do not advocate that all secret weapons should be openly shared, especially those parts that they possess exclusively. They also do not advocate abolishing all weapons that are inferior to atomic bombs, or prohibiting the use of these weapons. Therefore, it is impossible not to doubt whether they oppose atomic warfare for the sake of maintaining world peace and for all mankind, or whether they oppose atomic warfare in order to achieve absolute victory for their own country in future wars. At the very least, their anti-war stance is not necessarily thorough. Are they aggressors? We do not need to criticize or defend them, as the facts will speak for themselves, and future generations will have their own public opinion.</p>
<p>Opposing war, of course, includes all wars, not just opposing atomic warfare. If one only opposes atomic warfare and does not prohibit other lethal weapons, what is the meaning of this action? Mencius asked, is there a difference between killing a man with a stick and with a knife? This is the same principle. The three Axis powers of Nazi Germany, Italy, and Japan did not possess atomic bombs, but the entire world had already been disrupted by them to the point of shifting mountains and valleys, and drying up rivers and boiling seas. This proves that the third type of people who oppose atomic warfare but do not oppose all wars have ulterior motives.</p>
<p>Opposing war is opposing unprovoked challenges, not opposing the normal defense of those who are challenged. What is most hateful now is that people do not distinguish between right and wrong, but mix up challenges and responses, failing to clearly distinguish between them. Since there is no public right or wrong in the world, aggressors are able to openly reverse black and white, trying to conceal the truth from the eyes of the world. Like the Axis powers of the past, they clearly invaded the territories of neighboring countries and plundered the property of neighboring countries, but still euphemistically called it self-defense. Such blatant deception is only possible because the deceived are too muddled, giving ambitious people the opportunity to deceive.</p>
<p>Now, among the second type of people, there are actually some who generously propose to take out atomic bombs for open sharing or to destroy them without using them. This theory cannot be said to be ungreat or ignoble. However, at this time, to utter such grand but impractical pronouncements is unavoidable in being impractical, rash, and even muddled. We do not oppose the open sharing of atomic bombs, but there is a prerequisite: all those who participate in this open sharing must first guarantee that they will never individually abuse this weapon. If one does not ask about intentions, does not distinguish between benefits and harms, and engages in open sharing indiscriminately, who can guarantee that this powerful weapon will not be abused by ambitious people taking advantage of the situation? We should not think that once it is openly shared, everyone will possess powerful weapons, and they will naturally restrain each other, and no one will dare to strike first! Consider the past hundred years, among the great powers, have they not all maintained a considerable balance of power, and have not all powerful countries possessed considerable weapons and equal strength? However, war has still not been avoided! This proves that open sharing is not enough to restrain each other and reduce the ambition of aggressors. The reason for this is that while major weapons can maintain a balance of power, other auxiliary functions are inevitably superior or inferior, skillful or clumsy. Even if the advantages and disadvantages are offset and the forces are evenly matched, the role of timing is still very important. Therefore, aggressors often strive for initiative and the first move, as can be seen in the case of the Axis fascist countries. In the case of other weapons, one can still use space to resist time, and those at a distance can still take a defensive posture and gradually seek a turnaround. For example, the conspiracy of Pearl Harbor relied on the distance of the ocean, and Japan could only use a single act of deception to seize an initial victory, but failed to achieve a decisive final victory with it. The future will be different. If those who possess atomic bombs also imitate the conspiracy of Pearl Harbor to launch a sudden surprise attack, then even if the attacked have ultra-special weapons and a large amount of military equipment, they will probably die before they can even resist, or even before they can detect or feel the attack!</p>
<p>The three major culprits of world war have certainly already been brought to justice and perished, but we should not think that there is no one to succeed them. Humans all harbor a sense of superiority, especially those who have just entered civilization from barbarism, who have an even more arrogant view of the world. In the future, even if all nations and humans are civilized and progress to roughly equal levels, the sense of superiority may be reduced somewhat, but the positions of various countries and ethnic groups will still be difficult to force into uniformity, and wealth and strength will ultimately not be equal. The poor and weak will inevitably feel envy and jealousy towards the rich and strong, while the rich and strong will show little sympathy for the poor and weak, or even become arrogant as a result. In particular, countries that are strong but not rich are like gangsters coveting wealthy merchants, always thinking of robbing them for their own pleasure.</p>
<p>Some say that the reason why a few strong countries are suspicious of each other and cannot cooperate sincerely is because atomic bombs cannot be openly shared; therefore, the countries that "have not" cannot help but be apprehensive about the countries that "have." This often has a partial justification in human nature and physics. However, this is not the case in reality. The countries that do not possess atomic bombs account for nineteen-twentieths of the total, and most of them belong to the first type of people mentioned in this article. Their sovereignty and lives are still completely unprotected, but they do not dispute the possession of atomic bombs. They also have very little suspicion or distrust of the countries that possess atomic bombs, and some even want to take shelter under their wings, using their power to maintain temporary peace. At the same time, there are also some who are trembling with fear, feeling that their future is uncertain, but what they find worrisome and fearful is not the people who possess atomic bombs, but precisely those who have not possessed atomic bombs and are trying their best to possess atomic bombs.</p>
<p>The power of atomic bombs is indeed terrifying. The dropping of just two atomic bombs changed Japan's last-ditch resistance and led to its sudden surrender. This is indeed a major threat to aggressive and warlike countries; however, if those who possess atomic bombs can truly work for the common good of the world, it is difficult to predict. However, as of now, the countries that possess this special weapon have not abused their special weapons to invade other countries, and they do not have this intention. Their political systems also do not allow them to harbor this intention. Therefore, I feel that what was said in the previous section, that the suspicion caused by "have-nots" towards "haves" hinders international cooperation, is just a pretext to cover up their aggression. For the past year, whether it is the second type of people who are invading or the third type of people who are invading, the facts speak for themselves, and this article does not need to discuss it further. They are already so rampant even before they possess the most lethal weapon. Once they have it in their hands, what will they do? The few countries that possess this powerful weapon are unable to abuse it due to their special political systems, which is the greatest advantage of democratic countries. However, when it comes to resisting aggression and taking the initiative, the advantages of democratic countries become weaknesses. The third type of people see this point, so they are afraid of it on the surface, but not really afraid of it in reality; although they are not afraid of it, they do not dare to expand too quickly, to avoid provoking it. Therefore, the third type of people can only conspire to cast nets for a few prey at this time, and cannot immediately devour them. This is their greatest regret at present.</p>
<p>In the future, if the second type of people do not consider carefully and only sing high-sounding tunes and talk about openness, this will be exactly what the third type of people want, and will trap the first type of people, who truly love peace and account for the largest number in the world, in an endless sea of suffering!</p>

<h3>The Weak Emperor Guangxu</h3>
<p>— Tao Xiong</p>
<p>Reading "Unofficial History of the Qing Court"</p>
<p>Emperor Guangxu, that pitiful soul! He had no opinions of his own, and even when he did, he was never allowed to act on them. If he did, he feared his mother’s [Empress Dowager Cixi's] disapproval. Thus, he could only treat others’ wills as his own, walk the path that others had arranged for him, and await the fate that others had bestowed upon him. In the end, he harmed himself and others. A perfectly good empire was carved up by imperialists from east to west, leaving it in shambles. If only he had decided to do everything according to his own convictions, regardless of the path Cixi had laid out for him, with the country, society, and the people as his priorities. He should have initiated a revolution within his family the moment it was mentioned, preferring not to be emperor but insisting on having his own will! Then, China wouldn't have been reduced to such a miserable state!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Emperor Guangxu was still a good person, a pitifully useless good person. He had no will of his own and dared not have one. Cixi wanted him to like those he disliked, to marry someone he didn't love, and he dared not disobey, let alone refuse! But only he knew these pains! This was the retribution he deserved for lacking will and perseverance! The bitter fruit he had to eat!</p>
<p>He lacked the courage to resolve these small personal matters, so how could he have the courage to resolve national affairs? Could he only let his mother rule and resolve everything? As a result, this great land was plunged into chaos! Repeated land cessions and indemnities, loss of sovereignty and national humiliation, left the country riddled with holes!</p>
<p>Whether you are a great figure or a small one, you can give up anything, but you must have your own will! You must not lack perseverance! Otherwise, you will end up with endless regrets! People with weak wills and personalities, you can look at Emperor Guangxu in "Unofficial History of the Qing Court" as a lesson from the past!</p>
<h3>Watching the Rehearsal of "Unofficial History of the Qing Court"</h3>
<p>— Xiao</p>
<p>I just arrived from Nanjing, and before I even washed the dust off my face, I went to the China Electric Theatre Group on Haig Road to see a friend. I didn’t expect to meet so many friends, all from Chongqing. They were rehearsing the first part of "Unofficial History of the Qing Court." In this scorching heat, even fanning oneself felt too hot, yet they were wearing dragon robes and court boots, leisurely making a living in the palaces of the Manchu era! The director was still Mr. Yang Cunbin, who could freely bring his designs to the stage as he both wrote and directed. This group of good actors with a serious work ethic will not let this play fail.</p>
<p>In the rehearsal room, apart from the voices of the director and actors, there was no noise. They were quietly rehearsing, again and again. There was no impatience, no complaints. They were learning humbly because they believed that "true works of art" are not easily produced! It is shameful to use deceptive means to win the audience's applause! Apart from the actors, the enthusiasm of the costume and special effects staff was also truly admirable! So many ancient and colorful costumes, a belt, a hat—they were constantly dressing this person, remembering to modify that one. And the special effects? The drum beats were wrong, again and again… These unsung heroes were working there with their heads down! They were cautiously and tremblingly awaiting the birth of this "work of art"!</p>
<p>After the play was rehearsed, I forgot my dusty face, my tired body, I forgot to leave! I watched these young friends, who had returned to their monkey-like jumping, frolicking, and joking, performing a "comedic relief" after work. I thought, this is true rigorous work, lively life. I said to my friend with lingering attachment:</p>
<p>"Are you rehearsing tonight too?"</p>
<p>"Yes! How can we not rehearse? We haven't even finished five-tenths of the play!" He wiped his sweat while taking off his costume, folding it neatly and handing it to the costume staff.</p>
<p>"This part can be shown! I watched it and forgot where I was!"</p>
<p>"Not enough! Not enough! Far from it! We have to work harder! — I wonder what kind of reaction this first shot will have on the declining drama scene?…" Many thoughts…</p>
<p>From Chongqing, traveling down the river through Yichang, Hankou, and Nanjing, I met many friends engaged in drama work, all shaking their heads and sighing. It's hard to do theater these days, it's a money pit! The plays cultivated with a large amount of capital attract very few audiences. Losing money, accumulating debts, leading to the inability to stage a second play. This was the general situation everywhere I went. I heard that Shanghai is the same. What is the reason? Is it the impact of the civil war, the high cost of living, and heavy taxes that prevent audiences' salaries from affording a theater ticket? Or are the theater workers uneducated and unprogressive, disappointing theater enthusiasts who are unwilling to come to the theater to suffer and would rather seek other stimulation? This is indeed a problem worth studying. Otherwise, the entire drama movement will be unimaginable. I hope that this time, the Audience Performance Company's "Unofficial History of the Qing Court" can achieve success through humble learning! May this first shot be a "shot that soars to the sky"! Let the audience who once abandoned theater return to the theater! This company is prepared for you—dear audience!</p>
<p>The Audience Performance Company's "Unofficial History of the Qing Court" officially premiered tonight at the Lycée Français. This is not only good news for the audience but also signifies a new beginning.</p>
<h3>Performance of "Unofficial History of the Qing Court"</h3>
<p>— Yu Ping</p>
<p>The theater movement is experiencing a downturn, and the theater world is in chaos. Some are failing, some are changing careers, some are making a mess of things, while those who work seriously and conscientiously suffer endless pain, depression, and persecution. We blame the instability of society for causing such chaos, but theater workers themselves have not contributed much effort. Some escape, some turn a blind eye, some give way, and only a few persevere, holding steadfast to their posts and adhering to a serious attitude. Even fewer, in addition to persevering, devote themselves to hard work, clearing away the haze, and actively building. In this situation, how can the drama movement raise its head and turn itself around under multiple pressures?</p>
<p>The establishment of the "Audience Performance Company" brings new hope to the theater movement. They are the embodiment of the "hard work" and "China Electric" spirit, a group of smart fools. After taking off their old clothes, they immediately stand up and put on new ones. Their past style and artistic attitude have already been praised. Now, they especially emphasize their determination to "exist for, serve, and be loyal to the audience (not just cater to the audience)." Therefore, I believe they will be even more loved by the audience.</p>
<p>Their first performance, "Unofficial History of the Qing Court," is very appropriate. First, this is a historical play with a strong sense of realism, achieving great success in terms of historical perspective and writing technique. Second, this is not a preachy play but is beautiful, vivid, and deeply moving. Third, it has a group of brilliant, living characters. Coupled with the careful creation of a group of outstanding actors and stage staff from Hard Work and China Electric, I believe that this performance will mark a milestone in the progress of the theater movement.</p>

<h3>Blessings and Wishes for the Audience Performance Company</h3>
<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>The Chinese fear "extinction" the most. Some time ago, when two young and promising troupes in the theater world, China Electric and Hard Work, collapsed, and those who were still alive were struggling and fighting with sick bodies, gasping for breath, sensitive people were worried whether the drama would be "extinct" from then on, becoming silent and disappearing without a trace, turning into a silent theater. Just then, the "Audience Performance Company" was born, which is indeed good news. Finally, someone inherited the "incense" of drama, so that the "lineage" would not be cut off.</p>
<p>Over the years, the persecution that drama has suffered is endless and cannot be fully described. It is truly a story of bitterness and tears. But now that victory has been achieved, all that is wanted is guns and not culture. The fires of civil war have destroyed people's happiness and hope, leaving the theater world devastated and desolate. The "Audience Performance Company" was born in such a time of suffering. We are truly concerned about how this small life will survive this dangerous journey.</p>
<p>However, we have seen that this small life is thriving and endearingly tenacious, not afraid of the wind or the rain, and stands up in the midst of the wind and rain, shouldering a hoe to reorganize and cultivate this desolate and broken land. Their confidence makes people feel that hope and light stand with them.</p>
<p>From the beginning, they knew that drama and the audience are inseparable. What drama would there be without an audience? Drama belongs to the audience, just as a democratic government belongs to the people. With the support and nourishment of the audience, this small life can grow stronger. They depend on the audience for survival. What the audience loves, they love; what the audience hates, they hate.</p>
<p>Now they are going to perform "Unofficial History of the Qing Court," and they will receive the audience's fair examination for the first time.</p>
<p>In addition to blessing them, there are six wishes:</p>
<p>1. May "Audience Performance" live to be a hundred years old.</p>
<p>2. May the theater world flourish.</p>
<p>3. May taxes no longer increase.</p>
<p>4. May theater people have a stable life.</p>
<p>5. May performances not be obstructed.</p>
<p>6. May the drama movement have smooth sailing.</p>
<h3>After Seeing "House of Loyalty"</h3>
<p>— Wu Dapeng</p>
<p>Look! Among the films showing in Shanghai cinemas, eight or nine out of ten are appealing with pornography. So many young people are intoxicated in this fog. Aside from this, there are only nonsensical and meaningless films catering to the general low-level tastes of the audience. However, such films are a serious blow to the nation's culture, and can even be described as a fatal wound. But at this time, a domestic blockbuster containing a sense of justice has met the people of Shanghai. This is the performance of "House of Loyalty," creating a rare brilliance in our film industry.</p>
<p>The content of "House of Loyalty" narrates the loyalty of a family through three generations. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, they consistently struggled to the death against the enemy with unyielding integrity in the face of power and unshaken resolve in poverty. This film, relying on the superb techniques of the director and the earnest performances of the actors, has won unanimous praise. The male lead, played by Liu Qiong, is also the most successful actor in the film. He plays two roles, one as Hua Weigang, a patriotic aviator serving in the air force, and the other as Hua Gengzhai, the gray-haired, elderly grandfather. He expresses the spirit of both characters through different actions and words. This success is indeed not accidental, but entirely due to his skilled acting and refined Mandarin. The female lead, Qin Yi, plays Weigang's wife, who is also Gengzhai's daughter-in-law. Several scenes are very moving. Others, such as Ye Xiaozhu, who plays the grandson Damin, Yansu, who plays the Korean youth, and Tian Jun, who plays the air force comrade, all fully express their patriotic emotions. Han Tao, Fang Bo, Zhuang Kai, and others also performed well, adding a lot of color to the film.</p>
<p>After watching this movie "House of Loyalty," the audience will have endless feelings in their minds. Blockades, squeezing household rice – which compatriots in the occupied areas have not tasted this bitterness? Relying on the power of the enemy and puppets, acting as accomplices for tigers and preying on the people, the traitors will certainly be punished by national law. But we can never forget the fascist's cruel trampling. Anyway, with eyes full of blood, we still have to settle accounts with them. The magnanimity of a great nation must have its limits.</p>
<p>In short, this is a true depiction of blood and tears. Finally, I sincerely recommend "House of Loyalty" to all the citizens of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Speaking of Stage Technology</p>
<h3>Costumes and Colors</h3>
<p>— Wenquan</p>
<p>Due to the evolution of humanity, the colors in clothing have become the brushes of the new era. They explain the season, illustrate national characteristics, and provide a new demonstration of the human spirit. They imitate nature, compress the splendor of the universe and human thought onto the warp and weft. Density surpasses nature, specificity surpasses historical records; it has become humanity's darling, humanity's good friend!</p>
<p>From a personal perspective, it explains the character's personality, age, identity, season, and sudden events (such as weddings and funerals, etc.), and can predict to others extremely correctly, sensitively, and quickly.</p>
<p>In a materially developed society, it is trying to break the habit of people dressing for the sake of dressing, replacing it with the power of dressing for the sake of color. This power is gradually increasing its artistic value.</p>
<p>In drama, this power will be allowed to be fully exerted and is deeply welcomed by the art of drama. H.K. Moderwell said: "The stage picture is vivid and dramatic; its special beauty lies in action, in the participation of people. It is moving, while painting is static. Therefore, the stage picture has great vitality and sharp contrast." He explained two points here: the stage picture is moving, and this movement must have acting people to participate in, and then can produce the great vitality of the picture. Since the color on the clothing is attached to the body of the acting person, in spirit (drama) and in image (painting), it is a powerful factor that promotes the movement of the stage picture. This factor exudes the conflict of the human spirit, making the imageless picture become tangible, making the environment and characters like the atmosphere and all things on earth, producing inevitable causes and effects, the connection between life and death. At the same time, it stimulates the movement of the characters, making the static art of painting become the moving art of decoration. It acts as a mediator between humans and God, creating all things and glorifying the universe, completing the brilliant art of drama.</p>
<p>Now, take Benois's design for D'Annunxio's La Pisanall as an example to find proof of the great success of costume color in the overall color of the play:</p>
<p>In the prologue, in a rich interior with deep purple and bright green colors, decorated with gold and full of religious atmosphere, he introduced the two main characters with two extremely strong complementary colors: bright yellow (queen's clothes) and fishy red (prince's clothes). Then, in the first act, he laid a warm and hot orange-red on a rough black line, outlining a pier for anchoring ships. On this pier came countless rich and hot-colored, chaotic suitors, proposing to a female slave. Later, the prince came, wearing white clothes and riding a white horse. When the female slave accepted the prince's love, she put on the prince's white clothes and rode away on the white horse.</p>
<p>In the second act, he used calm pure blue, stylized white patterns, and added a little red-orange brushstrokes appropriately. The nuns wore white and gray-blue clothes. The entire monastery was filled with peace and tranquility. When the monastery was blasphemed by Prince Antlock bringing prostitutes in, a fresh, secular color destroyed the tranquil scene.</p>
<p>In the third act, they returned to the palace's glory and cruelty. La Pisanell was about to be executed due to the queen's conspiracy. The curtain used in this act was deep green with golden patterns. The overall color composition was extremely complex, but it is worth mentioning that there was a special red color throughout the act, varying in depth and gradually deepening. Near the end, the red became deeper and turned purple. Finally, the slaves re-entered the stage, all wearing purple-red costumes, bringing a pile of purple-red bouquets. This extremely hot color finally suffocated the woman.</p>
<p>His bold use of color has earned him immortal fame. It also proves that the power of color in clothing does indeed contribute to drama.</p>
<h3>Cleansing of Emotions</h3>
<p>— Guanyu</p>
<p>A stain on a piece of white silk can be washed in clean water to restore its whiteness.</p>
<p>In a person's heart, only art can restore peace to emotional troubles.</p>
<p>Dramatic art must have the function of "cleansing." It must make the audience in the theater forget themselves, otherwise the performance of this script is a failure.</p>
<p>We need scripts with progressive consciousness. We need scripts with dramatic quality even more. A script that combines these two must be a successful and good script! It must also be a script that the audience likes and readily accepts!</p>
<p>Many scripts that only have progressive consciousness are welcomed by intellectuals, but they are not necessarily welcomed by all audiences!</p>
<p>Many scripts that have dramatic quality are very popular with the audience, but they are not necessarily liked by intellectuals!</p>
<p>Many audiences go to the theater for entertainment, not to be educated. True artists work for social education, not to be entertained. How to narrow the distance between these two should be the responsibility of the playwright!</p>
<p>The script must have the power to control the audience's emotions! The audience must also feel a force pressing on them when they leave the theater. Otherwise, neither side's purpose has been achieved! The artist has not achieved the purpose of education, and the audience has not obtained the result of entertainment!</p>
<p>The audience only goes to the theater when they are bored and troubled. If the theater cannot satisfy them, they will stand up and leave! The audience who comes out of love is only the smallest number of the total. Treating them as important as eating is the smallest of the smallest minority!</p>
<p>Artists, never face the audience with a stern face and say: I am educating you!</p>
<p>If the audience cannot accept it, don't say: The intellectual level is too low!</p>
<p>Everything, everything should start from yourself. In any case, you should first let the audience accept your things. But you must not cater to the audience!</p>
<p>The audience is a piece of white silk with a stain, and the artist is a pool of clean water. When the audience walks out of the theater, you must restore the whiteness of this piece of white silk!</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Renaissance and Friendship Among Writers</h3>
<p>— Hualin</p>
<p>In the last Spring and Autumn supplement, an article was published titled "Literary Friendship and Political Relations," which was extremely sincere. The most precious thing in the world is friendship. Moreover, what literary artists admire in nature are the clear breeze on the river and the bright moon in the mountains, certainly not profit, emoluments and wealth; even if literary artists are involved in politics, they are not the kind of opportunists of politicians. They have a kind of patriotic enthusiasm, or the idea of saving the world and humanity!</p>
<p>Literary artists who become politicians and use literature as a tool for power struggles naturally will not have "true friendship"! Moreover, it is impossible to unite these speculators into one body. What we need now is friendship, to engage in the literary renaissance movement from true friendship, and then our work can begin. Now, let me raise one thing for everyone to discuss and advise on:</p>
<p>We often have opportunities to meet and talk. It is best to solicit and select one or two cafes or tea rooms in a convenient location with convenient transportation, and explain to the owner to cooperate by special appointment one or two days a week as a gathering place for literary artists. Rome's "Gongdao Di" and Paris's "Montparnasse" all have literary cafes. During the Chongqing period, we also had a "Saturday Evening Tea" gathering.</p>
<p>This is just a literary association of writers, but it is our urgent requirement! Starting with true friendship, we will then strive for local cultural construction, establish various literary and artistic societies, and suggest that the state guarantee the lives of writers and subsidize research and publishing undertakings, so that we can then promote it to the whole country to become a unified movement. After this great war, what we have learned is that no one can survive outside the world. The whole world is closely related. Any corner of the world can affect the safety of the whole world! Therefore, we must further communicate Chinese and Western cultures, accept new trends in the world, and wash away the corrupt air of China.</p>
<p>When we engage in the literary renaissance movement, we should of course start with writers' association and aim at the "whole world." We will carry forward China's inherent culture and contribute it to the world. Any academic thought in the world will be gathered in China to stabilize the future destiny of the world!</p>
<p>Political relations are temporary, and friendship is immortal! The expansion of friendship is the interest of life. "Gathering friends through literature, and assisting benevolence through friends." "The wind and rain are like night, but the rooster does not stop crowing." Only a selfless and philanthropic idea can have true friendship! Only true friendship can unfold the literary renaissance movement of the new era!</p>
<h3>Cup</h3>
<p>— Haoran</p>
<p>Picking up a bright, clear, pure white and lovely glass, I am silently immersed in a pool of thoughtful stillness! Indeed, I love it, not because it is light and exquisite, noble and rich, but because it deeply represents sincere emotion and the taste of life!</p>
<p>No one can live without a cup for a day, just as no fish can live without water for a moment, because it is closely connected with life. A person who is separated from a cup is like a fish out of water. Even if he can barely survive for a very short time, the lips of death have already unfolded a knowing smile; he will not be able to feel the universal love of God, and a dark world is opening its gloomy walls for him!</p>
<p>However, what people ask for is not a plain and ordinary life, a silent and odorless life...</p>
<p>If life is a blank and smooth sheet of paper, then the cup is a red, yellow, blue, and purple crayon; if life is a bowl of transparent and bland clear water, then the cup is a bottle of sweet, sour, bitter, spicy flavors; it will make the colorless colorful and the tasteless flavorful, even though some tones are strong and some tastes are pungent. This is not because people like strangeness and are unwilling to be ordinary, but because of the irresistible arrangement of the Creator.</p>
<p>Yes, the path of the world is rugged, life is turbulent, and the flow of emotion is the tide of the seashore, not the autumn water of the pond. Laughter, hot tears, sighs, and anger are intertwined to form a pattern of life. The joy of congratulating birth is still there, but the sorrow of mourning death arises again. The banquet for friends to wash away the dust of travel has not yet dispersed, and the farewell cup is about to be raised in a hurry. What power can prompt you to follow a certain life track? What comb can sort out the tangled threads of your mind? Birth, separation, death, farewell, joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, in the hall, in front of the spirit, in the laughter, in the tears, isn't it always and everywhere inseparable from a single cup?</p>
<p>Not only is the source of life, the striker of emotions, but the cup is also a symbol of peace! Barbarian beasts need beverages, but they cannot use cups; soldiers at war long for water, but they do not have the leisure to raise a cup; only the land where champagne is overflowing is the area where peace and happiness reach. With a cup in hand, all thoughts disappear. How much hostility and jealousy, how many sins and conspiracies, how much misfortune and resentment, all turn into nothing in the glittering nectar! If the heads of state of all countries could meet once every Christmas, talk openly and sincerely, and raise a cup to wish each other well, the tragedy of war would inevitably be reduced, and human life might be happier.</p>
<p>Pick up your cup and drink deeply! To celebrate the establishment of peace and the eternity of life!</p>
<h3>Wind and Rain on the River</h3>
<p>— Xiaofeng</p>
<p>Angry wind blows over the riverbank, rolling up a piece of waves. Abrupt waves embrace each other, advancing, spreading, heavily pounding the rocks on the shore.</p>
<p>Rain silk, in the gust of wind, like light smoke, like thin mist, is permeated on the Jialing River. Raindrops continuously sprinkle in the river, stirring up dense small circles on the waves. Following the abrupt waves, advancing, spreading.</p>
<p>In the wind and rain, the small shops on the riverbank appear so deserted. Rainwater flows down from the straw-covered roof, pouring into the small ditch, flowing rapidly towards the river. People all hide inside the house, the owner of the shop, has also moved the stall with miscellaneous objects inside.</p>
<p>In the narrow tea shop, the people taking shelter from the rain are like the wind and waves on the river, turbulent, laughing. The noisy sound echoes the wind and rain outside the house.</p>
<p>On the riverbank battered by wind and rain, there are no pedestrians anymore. The boatmen moor their boats near the riverbank, tie the iron chains on the bow tightly on the rocks, and then sit quietly in the cabin, lighting a crude cigarette, silently watching the river battered by wind and rain.</p>
<p>The upward wooden boat slowly climbed over the shoal, the trackers took off the ropes on their backs. In the wind and rain, their naked bodies were soaked in the water, and they ran to the side of the boat in a commotion.</p>
<p>The wooden boat entered the bay, the punter put down the punt pole in his hand, collected the tow rope on the bow, pulled a long tow rope from the river, rolled it into a circle, and placed it on the boat. The boat turned its head and moored in the bay to avoid the wind and waves on the river.</p>
<p>A canopy-less fishing boat is rowing over from afar. The young fisherwoman is pulling up the fishing net with effort, supporting it on the bow. Rainwater soaked her hair, soaked her clothes. The old fisherman is rowing hard with the oars, paddling the boat forward. Raindrops condensed on his beard, rainwater flowed in the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes.</p>
<p>"Dad, let's go back!" The daughter turned her head and said to her father.</p>
<p>"What a big rain!" The old fisherman muttered lowly, as if cursing, or as if sighing. The roaring wind answered him.</p>
<p>In the flowing wind, dense raindrops incessantly fall to the river, stirring up infinite small circles on the waves, advancing, spreading, and pounding the rocks on the shore.</p>
<h3>Dance End (Hetian Dance Star)</h3>
<p>— Situ Qiao</p>
<h3>Reading in Tuanshan Fort</h3>
<p>— Zong Baihua</p>
<p>The year before last, after the Allied forces captured Rome, news reporters went to interview Santayana, a contemporary great philosopher who was living in seclusion in the suburbs of Rome. An eighty-year-old man was still vigorously exploring the mystery of life, without feeling tired. The reporter asked him for his opinion on this World War. The suburbs of Rome were so close to the center of the artillery fire. Santayana replied leisurely: "I haven't had a newspaper for a long time. I now often live in the eternal world!"</p>
<p>What is this lovely and enviable eternal world?</p>
<p>For several years, because of avoiding air raids – not avoiding reality – I lived in a farmer's house near Dabo on the opposite bank of Baixi. In this turbulent era, my life was like a pool, only reflecting the bright moon between the pines and the clear breeze on the river. In the deep dark places of my heart, there is always a lurking desire, longing for hot life, vast world, and the trickling stream yearning for the sea.</p>
<p>One summer evening this year, my brother Situ Qiao suddenly visited. We had been separated for several years. I hurriedly asked him about his whereabouts after the parting. He said that he had been "a person of the east, west, north and south" in these years. He first went to the southeast corner of China, and then traveled to the northwest corner of China. From the scenery of the South China Sea to the desert mood, the breadth of his spiritual experience was both broad and deep, and he made countless paintings. I was extremely surprised when I heard this. I said that I must come to see your creations to fill the loneliness of my spirit in these years. On September 26th, my brother Wu Zixian and I agreed to go to Jin'gangpo Tuanshan Fort to visit Situ Qiao and fulfill brother Fu Baoshi's long-standing wish. Unexpectedly, the scenery around Tuanshan Fort is really picturesque. The high peaks on the back reach into the clouds, sometimes visible and sometimes hidden. The front has a wide view, and the distant mountains are like rings, with a myriad of images. Without the South China Sea and the northern border, this is already his "sea." The moon rises between the pines at night, which is especially quiet. Baoshi came and talked happily. In the morning, I asked Qiaoqing to show his works. Because a large part was being mounted, I didn't get to see the whole picture, which was quite disappointing. However, from what I saw, I deeply felt Qiaoqing's profound vision, broad interest, and skilled technique. And what satisfied me was that he could deeply understand and express the primitive meaning and the simple religious sentiment. This most precious and enviable honest religious sentiment in the northwest desert, this simple vitality, is really flavorful. Looking back at those walking corpses in our cities whose souls have long been emptied, how can we not be disgusted! "Morning Prayer," "Drinking Horses in the Wilderness," "Returning from the Horse Journey," "Autumn Water in the Tianshan Mountains," "Tea Chat," "Returning from the Glacier," etc., their beauty is not only in the image, color, and technique, but in the mood and atmosphere revealed in all of this, the deep feeling and vitality that are not decadent at all. This is what our art needs, and it is what our national character needs even more. Therefore, I hope that Qiaoqing's painting exhibition can have an impact on spiritual education.</p>
<p>But Qiaoqing can both paint passionate and moving, lively and leaping dancers, arousing my desire for life and feeling the rhythm of my body, and he also paints beautiful scenery that is light and dreamy, deep and poetic, which is intoxicating, and its taste is even more lasting. Perhaps because we are Orientals, we feel that there is unspeakable meaning in this "quiet realm," in this "silence," and in that painting "Farewell." The calligrapher uses new composition and new color scheme to write out the deepest music of our hearts here; here, on the surface it seems to be a new form, but in essence it is the ancient world feeling of the Orientals. Here I suspect that Qiaoqing was subtly influenced by his wife Yi Mei, because this has quite the artistic conception of the beauty of the words written by Yi Mei. It is said that Ms. Yi Mei is the first and most profound critic of every creation of Mr. Situ.</p>
<p>I stayed in the studio of Tuanshan Fort for two nights, enjoying the mountain scenery and snowy shadows, the night moon and morning glow, reading Qiaoqing's paintings and Yi Mei's poems. The next day, I went to bother brother Fu Baoshi again to admire his recent works and his wife's cooking. An unexpected gain was to get a booklet of small poems written by Situ Yuan (Qiaoqing's eldest daughter) from the age of four to nine, plus illustrations by Baoshi's son Xiaoshi of the same age. The booklet is named "Waves" and was published by brother Guo Moruo in the Siwei Small Series of the Political Department. This small book is full of innocent inspiration and the purest joy of life. Situ Yuan wrote his first poem at the age of four and a half in a boat from Shanghai to Guangdong:</p>
<p>"White waves, beautiful waves,</p>
<p>Every wave, every white rose."</p>
<p>Innocent imagination, innocent tone, innocent wording, really flavorful. And a poem "Sea Water":</p>
<p>"Sea water, really weird,</p>
<p>Rain comes and causes sores, wind comes and wrinkles the skin."</p>
<p>And a poem "Heavy Rain":</p>
<p>"Heavy rain falls,</p>
<p>The trees admire him very much,</p>
<p>The trees bow non-stop,</p>
<p>Bending their waists to the ground."</p>
<p>This is the real world. The world of childhood innocence is the eternal world where Santayana often lives, right?</p>
<h3>One Inch of Mountain, One Inch of Blood 40</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Japanese military and political leaders throughout history have thoroughly studied our country's "Strategies of the Warring States," regarding it as a "sacred典of national strategy." Whether dealing with domestic or foreign affairs, whenever they take action, they invariably extract one or two plans from the "Strategies of the Warring States" and imitate them. The so-called "hostage negotiation案" here is roughly the method of Cao Mo coercing Duke Huan and Lin Xiangru coercing the King of Qin, but with the addition of modern gangster tactics.</p>
<p>The second step, if the kidnapping fails, is to use "forced negotiation," which means "doing it by force." They would assassinate several important figures on the spot. Regardless of the success of the assassination, the second step is to launch a military occupation. The date for formally launching the military force must have an "eight" in it due to historical superstition, so they chose to attack at dawn on the 28th. Therefore, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow (the 26th and 27th) will be a tense moment.</p>
<p>After I informed Mr. W of Tsurumi's secret telegram, Mr. W, because he couldn't explain it in a few words over the phone and was afraid of leaks, asked me to go to Wang Lengzhai nearby to explain and offer some advice on the spot.</p>
<p>From Changxindian to Wanping, there is only a limited short distance. However, at this time, in the Wanping area, there were Japanese "plainclothes sentries," who were actually special agents and ronin, as well as hired Chinese low-class thugs and rascals, lying in ambush on the ridges of the fields and in dark corners. As long as they saw a single pedestrian dressed even slightly neatly, they would either shoot at random or seize them and leave, using them as hostages for extortion. If the kidnapped person was a poor person or a peasant who couldn't be squeezed for money, they would definitely be shot or forced into hard labor. This way, they could create a terrifying and chaotic situation, and people's hearts would be shaken automatically.</p>
<p>Because the matter was urgent and imperative, I discussed a safe method with Number 04. In our station (including Number 04), there were five top shooters, so we arranged a "flexible sentry." Number 04 preceded me, maintaining a distance of about ten meters. The other four took a step further, scouting ahead about twenty meters to the left and right, establishing temporary sentry posts about forty to fifty meters away. Once Number 04 arrived, they would give a signal and continue scouting forward, and so on.</p>
<p>In fact, we could have easily taken a car and rushed straight to Wanping, but we didn't want to alarm the enemy. Moreover, once we alarmed the enemy, they would inevitably overreact and be unable to track our movements. In that case, our radio station would be in danger of being exposed.</p>
<p>Around nine o'clock, we arrived safely in Wanping. Mr. Lengzhai was already waiting there. I first detailed the contents of the secret telegram and then told him Mr. W's plan. Lengzhai was a man of extraordinary bearing. Just listening to him speak, you could tell that his knowledge and experience were unique. No wonder the Japanese had repeatedly tried to argue with him, but he had always refuted them and left them speechless. With such talent, if he were placed in the position of Song Zheyuan or Han Fuqu, at the beginning of the war of resistance, I'm afraid the Japanese invaders would have had difficulty crossing the Yellow River. Even if they crossed the river, it wouldn't have been so easy for them to move south.</p>
<p>We continued to discuss for a while, and I offered another method that could easily crack the Japanese first and second steps of their conspiracy. After listening, he pondered slightly and said, "Very appropriate." We also agreed on the procedure for notifying several important figures of this cracking method through different routes, and the code words we would use to communicate secretly over the phone. If this method was rejected by the local authorities, we would use the agreed-upon remedy.</p>
<p>On the way back to Changxindian, because it was past midnight, the journey was relatively dangerous. I remember we encountered no less than four or five ambushes by special agents, sometimes one person, sometimes two or three. We couldn't be polite about this; we could only eliminate them one by one. Because if even one got away, we would have endless trouble.</p>
<p>When we returned to the radio station, our base of operations, it was already past two o'clock in the morning. Although we were very tired, we still had the energy to persevere. I immediately drafted two coded reports, one replying to Mr. W and the other notifying Tsurumi, explaining the overall method of dealing with the Japanese "Three-Part March" conspiracy. Before resting, I also drafted a note, asking someone to deliver it to Dingyuan after breakfast, inviting him to come and talk.</p>

<h3>Taixu</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>Because the Municipal Council passed the "Motion to Request the Municipal Government to Allocate Office Buildings for Autonomous Organizations to Facilitate the Promotion of Autonomy," which included the item "Appropriate or Borrow Temples and Public Buildings," it caused some monks from temples in this city to petition the Municipal Council in groups.</p>
<p>I thought of Master Taixu of Shanghai. Why is the master silent?</p>
<p>In July of the 32nd year [of the Republic], in Chongqing, I once visited Beiquan and Mount缙云, and visited the Han-Tibetan Buddhist Academy, which was then located in Jinyun Temple, and talked with Master Taixu, the director of the academy, for a few minutes.</p>
<p>I did not explain that I was a journalist. I met him as an ordinary tourist. In the short ten minutes, in addition to him leading me to view some souvenirs he brought back from his visit to India, I spent all my time watching this saint of a generation of Buddhism. I hoped to read from his bearing, expression, physique, and actions the extraordinary qualities of this religious believer. As for his original ideas and explanations on Buddhist studies, his several works are sufficient to explain them.</p>
<p>I have only one impression of the master: he is a person of perfect skill. The four words "perfect skill" may be the general public's view of profound Taoism. Insight, experience, and cultivation, beyond a certain level, a person's bearing naturally expresses a kind of serenity, solidity, and depth. I also felt this way about Bishop Yu Bin.</p>
<p>The master is not only accomplished in religious philosophy, but he also has a profound understanding of politics and society. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, he did not spend his time as an outsider traveling to famous mountains and rivers or hiding in deep temples and ancient monasteries to live a life of green chimes and red fish. This is what we all know.</p>
<p>Therefore, regarding the Municipal Council's resolution to "appropriate or borrow temples and public buildings," I hope the master will take this opportunity to explain and convey his personal understanding of current politics to Buddhist disciples.</p>

<h3>Kisses Are Harmless</h3>
<p>— Daming</p>
<p>[Editor's Note] This article was written by the husband of the female writer Xie Bingxin. He studies natural science. In this article, he especially emphasizes that healthy men and women kissing does not carry the risk of transmitting germs on the lips, even if the woman is wearing lipstick.</p>
<p>The naivety and vitality of American children really exceed the ideals of our great power's gentry. They are willing to let rickshaw pullers sit in the rickshaws, and they themselves desperately pull the rickshaws, running and sweating profusely, or get down on the ground and let children who collect coal cinders ride them as horses. This looks a bit uncouth to our dignified gentlemen and ladies with appearances. However, here is something even more surprising to them.</p>
<p>The bacteriology class at the University of Washington recently conducted an experiment to study whether kissing transmits diseases. It is said that this scientific research was the most successful. The results of the experiment can prove that kissing between healthy people does not transmit any diseases.</p>
<p>Four Pairs of Students Kiss</p>
<p>Before the experiment, a professor in the biology department carefully selected four healthy male students and four healthy female students from the class, paired them into four couples, and asked them to hug and kiss naturally on campus and outside the classroom. The kissing method and mood should be as realistic as possible. However, after kissing, everyone had to immediately conduct a bacterial culture.</p>
<p>A bacterial culture dish is a circular shallow glass dish, more than three inches in diameter and less than one inch high. It has a bottom and a lid. The culture medium is made of beef broth with some agar. When heated and poured into the bottom of the bacterial culture dish and cooled, it becomes a jelly-like solid. After being covered and sterilized, it can be used. If bacteria or spores fall on the culture medium and are kept at a suitable temperature, the bacteria can grow. After a certain period of time, each original bacterium or spore can form a cluster of bacteria, which can be easily seen with the naked eye. Carefully counting the number of bacteria can represent how many original bacteria there were. If there are common bacteria on the students' lips, they will fall onto the culture medium after kissing.</p>
<p>These kissed bacterial culture dishes were placed in a thermostat to allow the bacteria to grow, preparing for a rigorous examination to see if the lips of these people who kissed would be infected with pathogenic bacteria.</p>
<p>On the lips of a man named Harrison, there were a few staphylococcus and some penicillin, all of which were harmless. On the lips of a student who had just been discharged from the air force, only a very small number of staphylococcus were found, which was considered the cleanest.</p>
<p>Bacteria on Female Lips</p>
<p>There are far more bacteria on female lips than on male lips, because women apply more powder and rouge, and the bacteria brought by powder and rouge are several times more than those obtained naturally. However, no pathogenic bacteria were found.</p>
<p>This successful study can very well demonstrate the naivety and vitality of American children, and at the same time provide a strong guarantee for those who like to kiss. But I doubt whether such results can be achieved in a hypocritical society.</p>
<h3>Suicide</h3>

<h3>Urban Tumor: Venereal Diseases and Prostitutes</h3>
<p>— Luo Baoluo</p>
<p>According to an estimate by the Administrative Office of the Police Bureau in June, there are approximately 50,000 to 60,000 prostitutes in Shanghai. According to the regulations of the Police and Health Bureaus, prostitutes in this city must go to the "Venereal Disease Prevention and Treatment Center" on South Huangpi Road to have their bodies examined, and then those without diseases will be issued business licenses. From February 16 to June 6 this year, a total of 601 brothels and 1,777 prostitutes came to the center for examination. The examination results: 805 were suffering from syphilis, and 880 were suffering from uterine diseases. The situation of the remaining 40,000 or more private prostitutes who have not been examined is probably similar, spreading venereal diseases and poisoning society. It is really unthinkable!</p>
<p>Mr. Huake, an American professor at Yenching University in Peiping, traveled around the world in 1934 to investigate the prostitution system in various countries, and compared the number of prostitutes with the population of various cities to create a statistical table. According to the statistics, there is one prostitute for every 960 people in London, one for every 580 in Berlin, one for every 481 in Paris, one for every 430 in Chicago, one for every 150 in Tokyo, one for every 250 in Peiping, and the highest record is Shanghai, with one prostitute for every 130 people.</p>
<p>Terrible Numbers</p>
<p>In June of the 26th year [of the Republic], the Shanghai Times revealed a shocking fact. "According to a survey conducted by women's groups in recent months, there are a total of 349,744 women in the Public Concession, of whom 25,000 are engaged in the sex industry. There are a total of 277,300 women in the French Concession, and the concession has registered 390 brothels. In addition, there are 1,100 people who secretly prostitute themselves at any time." It can be seen that the estimate of the Administrative Office of the Police Bureau is based on fact.</p>
<p>Obscene Works</p>
<p>The abundance of prostitutes and the prevalence of licentiousness in Shanghai have lasted for seventy or eighty years. In the past, there were some self-proclaimed romantic, bored, and unscrupulous literati who wrote about the historical facts of prostitutes, no less than dozens of kinds, such as "Shanghai Muddy Lane Miscellany," "Xiepu Fragrant Bush Records," "Shanghai Elegant Hundred Flowers Picture," "Singing of the Prosperity of Shanghai Foreign Court," "Maritime Beauties Records," "Spring River Flower History," "Shanghai Color Art Guide," "Sixty Years of Shanghai Flower World History," "Dream of Maritime Prosperity," "Nine-Tailed Turtle," "Human Hell," "Biographies of Flowers on the Sea"...etc., mostly in the form of novels. Among them, there are also those with the meaning of persuasion, but most of them are frivolous and obscene.</p>
<p>At the end of the Qing Dynasty and the beginning of the Republic of China, the general literati and poets of Shanghai had a more whimsical idea and carried out the so-called election of "President of the Flower Country," determining the president and vice president according to the number of votes. The first president elected was a prostitute named Guanfang Lao Wu. There were ten elections in total. This move seems absurd to us. But thirty or forty years ago, it was considered a romantic affair.</p>
<p>In addition to Shanghai, several major cities in our country, such as Nanjing, Hankou, Peiping, and Guangzhou, are almost concentrated places for public and private prostitutes. According to a survey in the 24th year of the Republic [of China], there were more than 20,000 prostitutes in Guangzhou alone.</p>
<p>In today's society, life is difficult. Some women who have nowhere to go are forced to sell themselves. There are also girls from poor families who are sold to brothels. On the other hand, due to the economic downturn, single men have to go to brothels to seek satisfaction in order to solve their sexual desires.</p>
<p>Therefore, economic and physiological reasons have caused the prostitution problem to always become a serious social problem. If you want to remove this urban tumor—prostitution—you must start from the root. First, stabilize people's livelihoods, improve women's education, train their work skills, and establish women's relief homes to settle those lonely and helpless women. This method is at least more effective than simply relying on a ban.</p>
<h3>There Are Many Beasts in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Ling Yun</p>
<p>Senator Wu Zhengxu, in view of the fact that there are too few birds and beasts in Shanghai, advocated expanding the zoo. However, if the authorities are determined to expand the zoo, then not to mention two places, even twenty places can be established immediately. Because Shanghai is full of "beasts in clothing"!</p>
<p>Random Thoughts on Current Affairs</p>
<h3>Puyi and War Booty</h3>
<p>— Guizhou</p>
<p>After Japan surrendered, one country acted like a person who had lost their senses and did many inexplicable things. The most prominent of these were obstructing Korean independence, moving our country's industrial equipment in the Northeast, etc., and even hundreds of thousands of Japanese prisoners of war were "hidden" in Siberia and not repatriated for years. The world was amazed by this, and the Japanese were even more anxious. Therefore, recently in Tokyo, three thousand women and children marched in a petition. A few years ago, Japanese women organized a "Husband-Seeking Group" to petition the government. Now, there is a need to reorganize the "Husband-Seeking Country"!</p>
<p>The Japanese prisoners of war reminded me of Puyi. Although Puyi was a Japanese lackey, he was still a Chinese and should be subject to Chinese law. We are very grateful that the heroic Red Army "liberated" the Northeast. We also think it is reasonable to detain Puyi, but why does our country repeatedly request the extradition of Puyi, but the Soviet Union refuses to agree? Is Puyi also "war booty"? General MacArthur asked several times before he was allowed to send Puyi to the Far East War Crimes Tribunal to testify. In Tokyo, in addition to testifying in court, Puyi was "hidden" in the Soviet Embassy and forbidden to contact anyone outside. During his testimony, he repeatedly digressed to explain that the Soviet Union had no ambitions for the Northeast. In fact, whether or not it had ambitions was none of the court's business, so the judge became impatient listening to it. This is a rather intriguing matter. I remember when the Lytton Commission went to the Northeast to investigate, Puyi was also intimidated by Japan and said many things against his conscience to the commission!</p>
