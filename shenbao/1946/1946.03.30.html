<p>〔美新聞處北平廿九日電〕調處執行部對多事之秋的東北所擬採取之行動，今日業已開始，該部執行主任白魯德准將廿九日晨離此，俾爲即將遣赴東北之流動『休戰』小組四隊準備一切。期能建立基礎，進而解決東北各省之困難軍事問題。執行小組之遣赴東北，乃調處執行部工作主要之步驟，各執行小組已奉委員會之命，僅在軍事之調整方面進行工作，並須赴衝突區域或國共軍隊接連地點，促成停戰及應有之公平調整。執行小親四組，在初期中將留於瀋陽，因自該城出發至各危險地區，在交通上困難較少也。主要之一組，將留於瀋陽，俾可與出發之各組維持控制與聯絡，至於其他各小組之工作地點，在各該組未抵達瀋陽前，暫不發表。</p>

<h3>美資源開發局設計　長江興建大水閘　約計需資十億元需時五六年　大船行經水閘用起重機吊起</h3>
<p>〔聯合社科羅拉多州鄧維爾廿八日電〕美國資源開發局設計人員現正進行繪製中國長江三峽水閘圖樣。該局設計主任賽維治已將草樣製就。美國勃爾達水閘，在世界首屈一指，即由賽氏設計。賽氏現爲中國政府之顧問工程師，美國對興建三峽水閘所予中國之協助，僅限設計工作，中國政府將出資五十萬元。興建長江水閘之主要目的，一爲利用水力供給發電，二爲便利灌漑，惟長江流域民衆受惠將不止於此，良以水閘完工後，長江不致再汜濫成災，民衆可無流離之苦。建造水閘的計需資十億元恐需五六年始能竣工。惟一旦築成，將使其他水閘爲之黯然失色。該水閘將築於宜昌流域中間，高達七百五十呎，較勃爾達水閘猶高出二十四呎，可以阻止二百五十哩之水流，此項水流可供灌漑農田一千萬英畝。其發電力比勃爾達水閘及華盛頓州郭里大水閘與沙士塔水閘發電力之總和大三倍。預料修築水閘之費用將於此項電力中獲得補償。依照賽氏計劃，水閘築成後，長江航運，將不受阻碍。大船行經水閘，可用起重機吊起，然後再將其放於航路之上，至舢板及小船則將其置於巨大之金屬桶內，吊過水閘，如網中之魚。賽氏曾笑謂：如無人云「此種辦法不能實現」，則予將感覺失望。依美國資源開發局與中國政府所定合同，該局將對初步硏究情形，水力試騐，壓力及穩度設計，與需資若干等提供最後報吿。據悉：在鄧維爾主持水閘設計者爲總工程師楊格。</p>

<h3>伊朗與聨合國</h3>
<p>聯合國這一機構，現已遭逢着空前的危機。這危機能否安然渡過，克服種種困難，而依然向着維持世界和平這條大這邁進，就得看伊朗問題今後之如何解決。廿七日的安全理事會，因蘇聯代表提出延緩討諭伊朋問題之要求未被接受而遽然退席，雖仍繼續開會，聽取伊朗代表關於蘇聯撤兵爭議之報吿，但十一國理事缺了蘇聯，畢竟是美中不足。英內閣次日即舉行會議，檢討因此所引起之新局勢。美總統則聲明完全支持美國務卿貝爾納斯之立塲，且不以蘇聯可能退出安全理事會爲慮。事態發展至此，誠爲二次世界大戰以後戰勝國家意見紛歧已到了表面嚴重化的程度。世界安危，人類禍福，目前已息息相關，我們不能不回回頭來注意一些那引起糾紛的伊朗問題，而聯合國今後究將如何處理這一問題，允値得人們的重視。</p>
<p>關於伊朗問題，在聯合國機構於去歲在倫敦開會的時候，伊朗政府即向聯合國機構提出中訴，經過一塲舌戰以後，期間也着實有不少好看而有趣的塲面，此一問題乃交由伊蘇兩國直接談判。共時又有亞塞爾拜然省自主運動的發生，而伊朗政府爲保全伊朗的領土與主權的完整，又未便作過分的讓步，因此伊朗總理雖有莫斯科之行，終未成立協議。英美駐伊的軍隊雖於三月二日如期撤離，蘇聯不特未有撤兵撤反有增兵伊朗的跡象，於是伊朗政府又再度向聯合國機構申訴。不料正當聯合國理事會開會前三小時，蘇聯突然宣布撤兵。在蘇聯，一面要求聯合國安全理事會展期開會，一而於要求不遂以後，突於開會前二小時宣布　　　以以一種新的形勢，來應付這種國際集會。故當安全理事會第一次大會席上，蘇聯代表反對將伊朗問題列入大會議程，並宣布三月廿四日蘇軍繼續自伊朗撒退，除非發生「意外事件一，蘇軍之撤退工作可於五星期或六星期內完成。</p>
<p>但美國的見解却並不同於蘇聯。美國國務卿貝爾納斯在安全理事會大會席上稱：伊朗已將上項問題提交安全理事會，並指出蘇聯之舉動實已威脅世界安全與和平。伊朗駐美大使曾於三月十八日函美政府，聲明蘇軍在三月二日後繼續留駐伊朗，並干涉伊朗內政，目前蘇方雖已聲稱與伊朗獲得協議，但蘇伊旣未聯合向安全理事會提出聲明，我人不應拒絕聆取伊朗問題之爭辯。英代表賈德幹亦聲明英方完全同意貝爾納斯之主張。至此，蘇聯代表又不得不採取延宕步驟。蘇聯見安全理事會之延期召開旣經否決，不將伊朗問題列入議程又未能在大會通過，乃請求將伊朗問題延至四月十日再討論，復提出要挾：若大會對伊朗問題在四月十日前予以討論，蘇方將退出會議。因此，會議形成嚴重僵局，而終至蘇聯代表憤然退席。今後能吾在會外企圖打開此項局勢，尙不可知。</p>
<p>値得重視的是伊朗的態度。據路透社紐約廿七日電：伊朗駐美大使阿勒，已由伊朗政府授予全權，向安全理事會議，抗議蘇軍之繼續佔領伊朗北部及干涉伊朗之內政。蘇聯代表在安全理事會議席上，對於阿勒大使是否有權代表伊朗政府發言一點，表示懷疑，但伊朗方面則指陳阿勒大使於過去數日間與德黑間會保持經常之接觸。德黑蘭來電，亦證　　　及伊朗政府並未成立解決爭端之協定。另據本報訊，據倫敦廣播：伊朗總理否認渠曾就蘇軍退出伊境問題與蘇聯成立新協定；此說似頗可靠，因伊方始終未贊同安全理事會延期討論伊朗問題。觀察家認爲蘇聯請求延期之理由有二：（一）在四月十日前伊朋油產問題談判可吿結束；（二）伊朗政府之改組及亞塞爾拜然之地位屆時已可決定。</p>
<p>從上面這些報道，可知伊朗局勢的動向。就聯合國的立塲言，伊朗問題實是聯合國機構的試金石。聯合國機構的是否能維繫世界的持久和平，胥以如何解決道次伊朗問題爲斷。就法理上言，此番的伊朗問題，是由伊朗政府向聯合國提出的申訴，而伊朗政府並未撤回此項申訴，是此次安全理事會自應照常進行討論，不能因蘇聯的態度而予以延期。將來伊朗局勢如有傀儡政權出現，將使此伊朗問題更趨複雜。在此際，聯合國機構，義正辭嚴，表明其立塲，已爲無可避免之舉動。須知目前全世界像伊朗問題這一類的問題正有不少在醞釀着，如果伊朗問題在聯合國不能獲得合理合法的解決，不能根據正義信守條的，以維護國際的和平，則世界將依然是强權政治宰割的世界，距離大西洋憲實聯合國憲章目將日遠一日。我們雖不願說未來世界大戰的種十將在這些地方散播下去，而大國爲自私心理所驅使，以致喪失理性的結果，必將使世界人類在原子能時代遭受空前的災難。我們熱望世界和平，允熱望人類正義。但願聯合國以及參加聯合國的大小國家眞能大家披肝瀝胆，推心置腹，站在平等立塲，解決一切國際的料紛，不獨伊朗問題爲然。過去的國聯雖無能，猶有李頓報吿，將東北局勢的眞相大白於世界。聯合國機構爲全人類所屬望，對於維繫世界和平，負有重責，臨此伊朗問題的難關，更應作有力的表現！</p>

<h3>黃花崗烈士殉難日　本市各機關假臨時參議會禮堂　聨合舉行紀念會　追思勝利成果的由來先烈功績不可磨滅</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日爲黄花崗烈士紀念日，市政府，市黨部，淞滬警備司令部，三民主義清年團，上海市臨時參議會等，於昨晨九時，在南昌路一一一號參議會大禮堂，聯合舉行紀念會。到錢市長，李及關，各然政首長，以及臨時參議員共約百餘人。儀式簡單隆重，會塲中參議員及來賓席，均經移去，全體排隊肅立。由錢市長任主席，略述黄花崗烈士殉難經過，並致詞云；</p>
<p>錢市長詞</p>
<p>「今天我們紀念革命先烈，遵照中央規定，還不僅是紀念黄花崗七十二烈士，而且連所有革命先烈，不論是爲國殉難，或者是積勞病故，都一併在本日加以紀念。因此這個紀念日的意義，顯得更加偉大。尤其是今年，正當抗戰勝利以後的第一年，我們在這裏紀念先烈，目睹着勝利成果之獲得，而追思這成果的由來。我們須關切這成果的保持和發揚，感念過去，策厲將來，種種情緒，同時並起，更覺得這個意義的偉大和重要。我們要對得起，要報答爲國犧牲的先烈，最要緊的還是繼承他們未竟之志，實現三民主義，造成富强康業的新中國。回顧今日一般情形，與先烈的目標距離尙遠，所以希望全國同胞，各自站在自己的崗位上，分頭努力。我們辦理上海市政的人，便當切實努力去建設一個輝煌燦爛的新上海，同時並希望各位參議員，切實指敎，切實協助，以期完成我們共同的使命，才不辜負我們舉行革命先烈紀念的意義。」</p>

<p>繼由議長徐寄廣演講，略講：「今天是革命先烈紀念日，是黄花崗七十二烈士爲了推翻數千年君主專制政體，爲了爭取民主自由而拋了頭顱，流了熱血，壯烈犧牲的一個偉人的紀念日。本人有兩點意思要想向各位報吿，同時和各位共同勉勵的。第一，九年神聖偉大的抗日戰爭，終於在勝利中結束了。上海市臨時參議會，也在勝利不久的現在成立了，昨日我們已經開成立會。我們今日之能够濟濟一堂，在這裏開會紀念，飲水思源，我們也決不能遺忘了爲民前鋒，流血犧牲的革命先烈。在今天紀念會中，我們默默地想一想，我們應該如何誠摯地接受他們的賜予。第二，現在我們的國家已經由可恥的次殖民地地位，一躍而爲世界四大强國之一了。但是我們仔細想一想，究竟我們的軍備，經濟政治……種種條件，是否已能和世界列强並駕齊驅？如果我們的條件還不够，這是很危險的，我們應該深目警惕，上下一致齊心協力，迎頭趕上，才能不從頭等國的地位上掉下來。今天我們的口號，應該要踏着先烈的血跡前進，努力奮鬥建設新中國。」辭畢，於九時半，即吿散會。</p>

<h3>從一排整齊的靴鞋中雨明了她們全部生活　天眞活潑的一羣女孩婦女簡直不願意再回去　婦女輔助隊在上海</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　方丹</p>
<p>「本報特寫」當你溜馬路的時候，看見美軍吉普卡在電車與汽車之間風馳電掣，在那飛快的一　中，你曾注意到過駕駛吉普卡的，也有笑語盈盈的女郞嗎？一樣的綠呢制服，只不過下面是裙子；一樣的在手臂上或衣領上有階級的符號，一樣的俏皮的船形帽，然而覆在下面的，是秀麗嫵媚的面龐；扶在輪盤上的手，修理過的指甲，也染得紅紅的。她們一樣的剛强勇敢，一樣的充滿着歡快的熱情；她們就爲了工作的熱情，越過太平洋，越過「駝峯」，一九四四年來到戰時的中國。</p>
<p>她們是婦女　助隊，（Womcen　Army　Crop）協助美軍工作，人數一百多，先到重慶，那時她們住在重慶求精中學內美軍總部。勝利後，小部分調到廣州，大部分隨美軍總部遷來上海。此時留在上海的一共是八十多個，她們在美軍擔任書記。打字。速記。攝影等工作。</p>
<p>巨　達路一棟整齊的房子，有陽台，有草坪，原來是一個日本銀行家的私邸，此時做了她們的大本營。樓下是餐廳·客廳·以及休息室；二樓三樓是寢室。到處都有爐子，燒得暖暖的。樓梯口雖然沒有「男賓止步」的條子，但只要看就在樓梯下的會客室中，兩個靑年G.I.對着樓梯口的期待的目光，就知道會客必在會客室無疑了。沐息室與客室相連，有舒適寬大的沙發，有收音機，有畫報。從餐室出來，她們就在休息室坐下來吐烟圈，聽音樂。</p>
<p>「老遠地跑到中國來，想不想家呢」？「不！一點不覺得」！這是極坦白無飾的回答。在她們的國家復員聲中，工潮不正在奔騰澎湃嗎？戰時跑到社會上來，代替了男子的婦女們，不但將被排擠回家庭去，而且還在遭受着丈夫或愛人們失業的痛苦。現在在中國美軍工作的她們，衣食住全部供給，薪水雖然不多，（每月五十元起碼）可是有P.X.的便窒東西可買，在那裏，從口紅香粉以至吃的玩的，都有得買。現在在美國，女郞們正在鬧絲襪恐慌，可是此時在上海的她們，只要有錢，一樣的却可買到。「上街買東西遇到困難嗎」？「自然，而且有時要論價」。她們說上海和紐約有些相像，但這也許就是紐的跟上海幷不相像的地方了吧！</p>
<p>說明着她們生活的全部的，是寢室，是每一張床下面排列得整整齊齊的那一隊鞋子：粗笨結實的靴子，爲了雨天出街跑路；半高跟的普通鞋子，是經常配着制服穿用的；兩三雙足跟離開地面三時的玲瓏鞋子，便令人想到是在禮拜三禮拜六和禮拜天，除去整齊熨貼的制服，換上坦胸露臂的晚服，旋轉於舞池所用的了。在這些遠涉重洋而來的鞋子之內，還有日本風的木屐，那是沐浴時用的；更有緞子繡花鑲滾皮毛的平底鞋，這是她們來到中國，對這神秘古老的國家的欣賞所在。「喜歡這種鞋子嗎？」「呵！穿起來舒服極了！」她們的滿意，不用到長睫毛之下去探尋，已經洋溢在甜蜜的聲調里了。</p>
<p>從道些手工繡花的緞鞋到遠程旅行而來的精美的高跟鞋，也說明着這兩個國家的距離，相差還多麼遠！而她們，這幾十個女孩子，却生活在這距離的調和里，感到舒適，感到滿意，而且她們快要「樂不思蜀」了！</p>
<p>在舖着軍毯的床上，有大洋娃娃；在書架上下面是整齊筆挺的洋裝書，上面却陳設着一霞飛路的猶太商爲她們搜集來的一些所謂中國古玩，小人小馬，以及玲瓏的盆景之類。</p>
<p>管理她們的是Captain　Rose　Wagner，她有着非常嫻雅大方的風度，而且還這麼年靑。「女孩子們在早上六點鐘都規律地起床嗎？」「不一定，若她們夜間回來得晚，也可隨便些。」她笑着回答。當她指給我們看放電影的白幕的時候，帶點詼諧地說：「道兒有電影，爲了要留女孩子們在家里！」她又談到WAC的女孩子們，都還未婚。</p>
<p>下月初，她們之中將有三十個可以回國，這該是歡喜的事，可是在她們，却幷不一定如此希望。她們已把上海當作東方的紐的了呢！</p>
<h3>三公會電請　發還刼餘紗布</h3>
<p>本市染織棉布紗業三公會，均已整理就緒，召開成立大會，當時各該業會員代表，對於請求敵產處理當局發還敵僞強迫徵用紗布一案，均有議案提出，并各委托公會理事會全權辦理，繼續力爭。三公會方面昨又有電文致行政院提供意見，（一）紗布確爲被敵僞倚勢強迫徵購，并非白願出售，似當依照民法規定，認為無效，（二）强迫收買之限價，不及當時市價百分之二十五，延經三年，尙有四分之一之價款尙未給付，此項未付價金之紗布，應請衡情審議，予以發還，（三）當時敵僞規定雖有四分之一之價款係搭發標金，但因紗布漲價之速度，遠出標金之上，應懸體念商艱，准予發還，（四）現存剩餘紗布之中，毫無敵商紗布在內，發還時幷不發生分劃敵有商有之爲難，（五）査證發還，誠不免因敵僞一再移動，或僞商統會移交時已多混和，淸理爲難，希望酌定合理辦法以爲補救，但其中有一部份紗布，當時係由敵僞責令原戶保管，原物尙在，應懇儘先准即發還，（六）染織廠，棉布號，紗號業，遭此浩劫後，破產　業，不勝枚舉，非急將此剩餘紗布發還救濟，難以復蘇。</p>

<h3>全國各地昨熱烈慶祝　勝利後首屆靑年節</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕昨爲第三局靑年節，全市國旗飄揚，又逢久雨初晴，益增光輝，三民主義靑年團上海支團部，特於上午十時，假市體育館舉行本市勝利後首次慶祝大會，並中國空童軍宣誓授旗典禮。參加者，有三民主議靑年團·各學校·各職業團體三十餘單位。各機關首長，到錢市長大鈞，吳主任委員紹澍，李副司令及闌，吳局長開先，及來賓傳曉峰，沈春暉，詹文滸，美國童子軍聯合會代表卡魯爾，英國童子軍聯合會代表高爾登，及榮譽軍人王長喜等三千餘人。</p>
<p>大會主席說明意義</p>
<p>首由大會主席吳紹澍致詞，略謂：今天是第三屆靑年節，亦是我們上海第一次以這樣盛大的姿態來紀念我們靑年自己的節日。這利其他特定的節日，如「四四」兒童節，「六六」敎師節，「三八」婦女節等，多少都含有紀念的意義。三月廿九日，是革命先烈黄花崗七十二烈士殉國紀念日，布卅五年前的今天，這些革命的靑年志士們，用頭顱熱血，震懾了昏庸腐敗的淸廷，喚醒了中華民族的靈魂，因此奠定了武漢起義成功的基礎，這革命靑年的大集合，無疑是革命史上不可磨滅的奇蹟，所以當我們三民主義青年團，在三十三年三月廿九日，召開第一次全國代表大會，通過議案，要議定一個日子爲靑年節的時候，我們的團長亦就是我們的蔣主席，特為核定了三月廿九日這一個日子。此時此地，我們慶祝和紀念靑年節應有的認識，可以分成三點：第一，要學習黄花崗革命先烈純潔熱烈的愛國精神，努力完成復興建國的使命，達成我們革命先列的目的。第二，國家經過了八年苦戰’元氣亟待恢復，民生主義的經濟建設，亟待開展。我們靑年應發揮建國精神，埋頭苦幹，努力創造，使國家經濟建設迎頭趕上，向現代文化的道路邁進。第三，我們革命靑年的唯一任務，在掃除一切建國的障碍，實現民權主義的民主政治，因此我們必須團結起來，在靑年團的領導之下，團結奮鬥，方能完成我們民主政治的革命使命，而達成革命靑年第三次大結合的目的。</p>
<p>市長致詞勉勵靑年</p>
<p>嗣由錢市長致詞，略謂：今天是革命先烈紀念日，中央所以選定今天爲靑年節，就是因爲當年爲革命而成仁的黄花崗諸烈士，大半是二三十歲的靑年，他們純潔熱烈的愛國精神，正可爲今日靑年所效法，所以有此規定。我們如何效法革命先烈來完成建國大業？本人認爲第一要有遠大的抱負。我們靑年今天所處的時代，是五千年來所未有的大時代，我們靑年應負的責任，也是空前無比的大責任，當前擺在我們面前的一條康莊大道，是要建設三民主義的現代國家，無論在社會建設方面，政治建設方面，經濟建設方面，倫理建設方面，乃至心理建設方面，都需要我們靑年担任中堅幹部，所以我們靑年，必須要有「以天下爲已任的志氣」，以創造進取的精神，來完成革命建國的使命。錢市長詞畢，詹文滸，李及蘭等相繼致詞，幷由主席介紹榮譽軍人王長喜與全體見面，全塲掌聲雷動。嗣即舉行中國童子軍上海支會直屬空童軍第一團宣誓曁成立典禮，由錢大鈞監誓，吳紹澍曹俊·葉春年·應世文·范曉證誓，儀式莊嚴隆重。大會結束後，由體育協會舉行靑年節本市靑年越野賽跑給獎典禮，收到錦旗獎品多件，由錢市長給獎，得獎者合計十名。</p>

<h3>壯志凌雲　引導靑年天空去的　空童軍</h3>
<p>— 本報記者惺吾</p>
<p>科學已把人類的領域從水陸擴充到天空間了，茫茫的太空，無疑的將成為我們樂園。第一次世界大戰，人們發現了天空的重要，而加以利用，第二次世界大戰，空軍更成了決勝負的主體。當然，飛機並不是專爲殺人而發明的，那末空童軍你也別想像爲一支凌空殺敵的「小隊伍」，他們的目的是：「引導靑年向天空去了。</p>
<p>因為戰爭的介紹，空童軍在美國首先出現。在我國是昨天才正式開始，有第一團的空童軍，他們的前身是中美童軍聯誼會，團員一共有三十三人，因為有一人生病，所以昨天在體育館的宣誓和授旗典禮，祗有三十二人參加。他們的第二中隊十一名隊員，全是中西女校的女學生，其餘是從旦·大同·聖的翰·滬江附中等校學生，也有二位已在商界服務，他們每人都有一定的事務，不能整天受訓，所以每星期祗召集一次。除了童軍三級課程以外，還注重航空知識，如飛行。滑翔。無綫電等科目。</p>
<p>不能否認我國的空軍還在萌芽時期，今後正需努力增强，我相信因爲空童軍的迅速長成，空軍的質素也將大大的進步。同時我希望空童軍由三十三人而立即擴充到三萬·三·三十萬·　三百萬人，使大中華的天空樂園，由我們自己來經營和保衛。</p>

<h3>運河道上</h3>
<p>— 本報廿五日鎭江訊陶甸寄</p>
<p>記者現在　　所說的這個運河　上，並不是指的由起點而至終點的運河道上，乃是僅僅的由揚州全萬郵的一段。這一段運河，以董里計算，爲一百〇六里，小人輪可以當日來回，而且不慌不忙。倘再易以汽車，那末祇需五小時左右，就可以來偶往返。民船是起碼一大，僅能完成單片的工作，而且還要看是不是順風，現在因新國共的界限，汽車固然是談不到，就連小火輪也都絕了影踪，唯一的交通工具，僅有郵政快船，和一些荷葉大的小船，來維持着道百〇六里的交通。</p>
<p>一綫長隄　保障下河各縣</p>
<p>我們不要看輕了這運河的一綫長隄，它是負着整個蘇北裏下河一帶的生命財產，倘若一且潰冲，則下河各縣，不但農產物蕩然無存，使是人畜均有其魚之苦。民國二十年的運隄冲口，便是一個最明顯的成例，記者前曾隨着華洋義賑會去到興化一次，那一種水災慘象，迴想起來，還是歷歷在且，全城僅有縣府後進和夫子廟有一塊乾凈上，餘下的便全是水，最低　的街道。僅僅可以看出屋頂，所以一到運河水大的時候，興化人便忙到高郵來保壩，而高郵人因爲不開壩，則滿河大水，無從宣洩，萬一發生不幸，便要首當其衝。爲了一方面要開，一方面要保，常常把負責運河的大員，弄成左右做人難，無所邇從。</p>
<p>濬河工具　早已蕩然無存</p>
<p>在遜淸的時候，對於運河，是非常之重視，歲有專款，按時興一修，並且駐有大員，負責工作，層次井獎。在平時是養尊處優，雖小至一名河夫，亦有「河工老　」之稱。但是一經出了危險，所謂大員總是褂冠跳河，以謝百姓。即到民初亦還委以要員，專司其職。隊了春修夏防而外，還有一些　河工具，如挖泥船等，往來運河一帶，從事疏濬工作，誠恐河泥淤塞，河身轉漢，容量减少，但是時到如今，不但談不到春修夏防，連那些工具也不知流落何處。所以現在的運河，險象環生，尤以高郵一帶爲最重。而且歷來運河發生潰冲，以高郵爲最多，這是因爲有着高郵湖的關係。在水小的時候，問題毫無，倘若一經過到大水之年，危險程度其是不堪設想。</p>
<p>頻年以來　隄身迭遭破壞</p>
<p>在抗戰初期，恐日軍從運隄向高郵進犯，所以由邵伯至淮陰的一叚河隄，逐叚破壞，挖成溝漕。淪陷而後，在僞組織的時期，無人過問，現在更瘡痍滿目，敗壞不堪。而且有人預言過；說是今年恐有水患。蘇省人士，乃計劃向救濟總署，商量一點辦法，作一種未雨綢繆的準備，進行春修。可是這一綫長途，却又完全操在共軍範圍，乃請出參政員冷禦秋等，前往運河一帶視察，俾便着手進行。結果，據說是未得要領而返，這樣的趨勢，是祇好任其自然，不過蘇北的人民，在這八年抗戰當中，已經是筋疲力竭，倘不幸再遭遇到水患，那不是天要滅亡蘇北人而何？</p>
<p>邵伯鎭上　變成了三不管</p>
<p>這是運河綫上一個有名市鎭，現在除了揚州是國軍範圍而外，其餘的是都在共軍掌握之中，而邵伯這一個市鎭，是比較特殊的，它雖然在名義上是屬於共軍，但是從邵伯向南，便又是國軍的範圍了，在這個鎭上的人，是相當便利的，尤其是用錢方面，抗幣法幣關金，甚至僞券，都不受重大約束縛，而且還可以從中獲利，到江南的人，一到邵伯，便要將抗幣兌成法幣，反之，不但一又不値，而且說不定還要犯罪，由　偵蘊北邊　的入又　　法警兌威　幣，才能算得道就是呌散「餞』，若是不換，則一經査出，不是悉數沒收，便是一撕了之，兌換的比率，按照規定而外，再加上一此無標準的升降，有人估計過，一萬元的法幣，祗需兌來兌去的五次，便可以將一萬元化爲烏有。</p>
<p>楚河漢界　難為了老百姓</p>
<p>離開了揚州三五里的路程，便有共軍的踪跡，最明顯的，是可以從標語上看出，而我這一次在路上，是由一位車夫，在路上慢慢的對我說：「先生，這里是新四軍的範圍」。</p>
<p>我聽了望望四野，大地是很沉靜的，看不出一點痕十跡出來，我不相信，地勢是分得這樣的明顯，一會兒，他又在沒慢的對我說：「先生，還里是國軍範圍」。　記者也望望四野，大地是很沉靜的，並找不出一點痕跡出來，我祗有一點感想，是新四軍的範團也好是國軍的範圍也好，但總是中國的土地啊，中國人爲甚麽要分出像這樣的楚河和漢界，因着這樣類似楚河和漢界，却把一般的老百姓，弄得痛苦極了，中國人走在中國的路上，行路却要小心，說話也要小心，稍一大意，都是危險重重，老百姓是犯了何罪？</p>
<p>兩點呼籲　希望早日解決</p>
<p>這一次二中全會的宣言，關於恢復交通這一點，特地指出來說，「交通不能恢復，人民則不能自由往來，貨物則不能暢遂流通，其他一切，更無從說起」，這的確是一個最嚴重的問題，因此，我們對於這一點，希望國共雙方，要以民生爲重，再不能把老百姓弄得無路可走，而一味的望死路上趕去。第二，是幣制問題，八年以來的抗戰，僞幣的影響，已經是使老百姓疲於應付，現在旣然勝利，就該讓人民稍獲喘息，不應再有抗幣和法幣的阻校，經濟遭了凍結，抗幣的困難，反而較僞幣爲允甚，因爲是四面不能流通，國共雙方，旣然好像均以民衆爲第一，便該早日先把這兩件痛苦取銷，作一個適富解決的辦法，這才是眞正的爲民。</p>

<h3>原子鼻祖</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室譯</p>
<p>關於原子的理論，不向今日始，在兩千多年以前早已有人發見了：那人便是被稱爲「嘲笑哲學家」的古代希臘思想家德謨克里圖。他平已斷定那無限小的質點裏面包藏着宇宙的秘密，可是直到我們的時代，這理論方纔成爲科學上的一項重大發見。</p>
<p>德謨克里圖誕生於黑海和愛琴海左近色雷斯占國（在今希臘和歐洲土耳其境內）的阿不台拉城，城中的居民素以愚　無知出名的。他的父親曾經私通侵略國波斯國王薛西斯，後者爲表示答謝起見，送給他許多精美的禮物，中有亞洲古國加爾底亞的魔術家即「東方的聖人」數人。靑年的德謨克里圖就跟着這幾個聖人學習。他父親死後，他把遺產變賣，出發遊歷各地，研究學問。</p>
<p>倦飛知返從事講學</p>
<p>他遍訪埃及的僧侶和術士，愛西屋皮亞的預言家，波斯的占星家，和印度的苦修的千里眼術土。他以沈思默想探索着物質的本源，他精密地觀察自然界，終於演繹成一種唯物論的見解，和近代思想比擬起來，幾乎沒有兩樣。經過許多歲月以後，他纔「倦飛知返」，回到故鄉阿不台拉城，度着敎師和講學的生涯。</p>
<p>他每次出現在公共塲所，總是對着世人的愚發毫不留情的冷讓然笑，因此得到了「嘲笑哲學家」的譚號。阿不台拉這地方可供嘲笑的事情實在太多了，所以他至死不肯離開那裏。他所作的氣象預告和政治變動的預言，什九應騐，使得他的同鄕大為　驚奇，而把他當做神人看待。他不但是原子論的鼻祖，而且也是曆法的始創者。</p>
<p>在義大利那不勒斯的博物館裏陳列着德謨克里圖的半身石膏像——滿臉髯髭，帶着嘲笑的表情。這位上古的哲人以嘲弄世人，玩笑人生而名傳後世，可是現代世界突然發覺他所首先發見的原子不再是一種談笑的資料了。</p>
<p>發展的可能性無限</p>
<p>原子能的利用尚在發軔時期，它今後發展的可能性是無限的。愛因斯坦曾經說明物質不過是凝集的能，一種物質在理論上可以改變爲叧一種物質。從他的簡單的方程式中計算出：如果把一磅泥土中所含的原子加以毀滅，可能產生一百萬匹馬力，供一萬小時應用，即足供紐約一年所需的電力。</p>
<p>在工松師能够想出方法把U—235代替煤或油以前，大約還須經過許多年月。如能達到那種高度工業化的階段，那時的發電廠一定跟現在的大不相同了。那時蒸氣將藉原子能的熱力來產生出來。</p>
<p>我們使想一塊橡胡桃大小的鈾裏面所含的潛能等於一千二百五十磅的上等煤，如能加以利用眞是一件不可思議的奇蹟。</p>

<p>到會的那犬下午，他成了全塲注意的人物，他穿着一身黑色帶有細白條的呢買西服，已現銀白的頭髮，自右分開，薄薄的貼在頭上，面孔豐滿，並不顯肥碩，鼻子上，架着一付配着黑邊的白金眼鏡，上唇蓄着花白短髭，給人的印象是莊重高貴，並沒有一般外交家的時　華臨矜。</p>
<p>顧大使的「遲到」，在二中全會徐堪部長的糧食報吿中曾提到，是因爲向英方交涉，請允許開放東南亞產米區向中國輸出食糧的問題。因爲「遲到」，全會上最重要的外交報吿檢討節目，他未曾聽到。因此，在參政會中，政治協商會議及外交兩次大會，他都出席在旁聽席上，他坐在吳鐵域秘書長與朱經農次長之間，鐵老不斷以英語和他低聲交談。政治協商會議，是勝利後國內政治上的一個新事件，顧大使極其注意。下午的外交報吿及詢問中，不少發言者，把談話投向顧大使，因寫大家提到聯合國大會！提到外交作風等等，再都是與顧大使密切相述的。</p>
<p>就新聞記者看，他是一位不應放過的新聞人物，而在二中全會與參政會中，却都因爲時間匆匆，沒有機會與顧大使作長談。在參政會中政治協商會議報吿那天，利用着休思十分鐘的時間，僅作了一段短短的談話，記者間他這次回國預備待多少時間？到不到別的地方走走？他說計劃着停留一個月，預備要到平津一帶看一看，　沒有談到正面問題，台上的吳貽芳主席已經從擴音機中宣佈「繼續開會」了。記者請顧大使爲本報簽一個名字作紀念，就匆匆結束了這個訪問。</p>
<p>顧大使是在國際上一位聲譽崇高的外交家，而他給人的印象，却也和　可親，絕沒有一般外交人員的囂張矜持態度。</p>
<p>本報重逢特約記者……趙浩生寄顧大使為本報所作檢字式：顧</p>

<h3>閉幕的話</h3>
<p>— 遠曙</p>
<p>展覽會閉幕了，我們回顧過去數日的成績，覺得有著說不盡的謝意。</p>
<p>首先，我們應當感謝這將近十萬的觀衆，爲了珍貴中國工業目前的僅有收穫，爲了求得新科學知識的渴望，他們踴躍的前來參觀。並由於我們維持秩序的難能周密，使他們不免受有許多拘束和限制，深爲抱歉。又承爲了充實中國技術教育的內容，願意捐輸給我們技敎助金，使我們的中國技術專科夜校無慮無費，深深感激。</p>
<p>共次，我們得感謝廠商的合作。各廠高都化了很大的　備費用來佈置，並且贊同我們的宗旨，願意在展覽的內容中加强敎育的意義，對於生產程序和原理特別注重說明，使觀衆易於了解，適合現階段工業化的需要，也是我們大家可以慶幸的。</p>
<p>輿論界的好意也是値得提出的。每一張報紙每一位記者，都對我們的缺憾給予最大的寬容，對任何纖小的成就，寄予最大的希望。這完全是爲了中國，爲了中國的工業，爲了中國的工業需要鼓勵，需要培養，這一種輿論的熱情，是我們技術人員和每一位有志發展民族工業的人們所感到興奮的。</p>
<p>我們也要感謝每一位展覽期間的工作人員，連各廠商派到會裏服務的代表們在一起。技協約同人是展覽會的籌備負責者多不必論，許多位邀來協助的非會員的友人們，純盡義務來担任各專門的工作，相信也是對於推進工業建設具有熱誠的。各廠商仝人不厭煩倦不避辛勞，到塲照料，並爲觀衆解釋，我們尤其深憾沒有好好的接待他們。</p>
<p>然而大家可以欣慰的，一幅新少工業的遠景總算籍上海工業品展豐會的機會展開在全國人士的面前。我們彼此相信，只要我們大家不感覺困難，我們大可以一年一年的繼續辦工業品展覽會，那這遠景必可以一天一天的拉近來。</p>
<p>再會罷，每一個關心和負責中國新工業的先生和女士們，路是不難走的，不過也得要一步一步走過去。</p>
<h3>技術人員和技術建設</h3>
<p>— 方艾</p>
<p>推進技術敎育的方向有二，一方面是普一遍的推廣技術敎育，使每一個國民普遍的注重工業問題，造成一種學習工程的社會風氣。得到最低限度的工業智識。另一方面是深入的培養一批苦幹實幹，意識上願意為建設新中國努力的技術幹部。造成學習工程的社會風氣的結果，才能鼓勵了多少靑年走向苦幹實幹的道路，中國技術協會主辦的上海工業品展覽會，目的就在希望造成這一種社會風氣；過去所舉辦的工業講座，和技術等科夜校，就是在培養一批工業建國的技術幹部。</p>
<p>上海工業品展展覧的內容，在一些不熟悉工程問題的觀衆　許嫌太枯燥，在一些專門研究工程的觀衆，一定又嫌平凡，但是無可否認，如果你能化上一兩個鐘頭仔細聽一聽各展覽部門的解釋的話，他們會吿訴你多少改進硏究過程中的辛酸史，技術人員在不接觸工程的人看來是一個手藝匠，在一些學術專家看起來是淺見者，却不知我們日常的生活，却不能不依賴這批實幹的技術人員的努力，每一種工業品經過了他們不斷的改進，才使人們的享受，達到目前的田地，原子炸彈的原理，盡人皆知，所爭持的，也只是一個技術問題。</p>
<p>技術的改進，不是一　難事，問題是在我們有沒有這種艱苦的精神，社會的實力份子是不是重視這一問題。前者是中國技術協會需加努力的，後者則是希望各界予以協助的。</p>
<p>本會的過去和將來，道過這一次展覽會，已經明顯地呈現在各界面前，願愛護本會的先生們，給予我們指正和協助。</p>
<h3>我們的呼聲</h3>
<p>— 師越</p>
<p>上海工業品展覧會開幕迄　六犬，觀衆之盛，爲八年夾所僅見，眞是始料所不及的。這樣看來，中國工業化何嘗沒有希望。</p>
<p>我們自問是後起的集團，所以隨時隨地的虎心徵求批評，但美中不足的是只聽見頌揚的字句，使我們少了攻錯的機會。</p>
<p>來了！偶然在一個私人談話裏聽到了兩個反面批評：一位說：『這種展覽會，開在五十年前，還有些意思。」我就對他說：『我們正因爲現在中國的工業，先是遭到敵僞的摧殘，接着又受到勝利的挫折，在倒退是情形之下，還不及五十年前的方興未艾，所以要用五十年前似的展覽會，把中國工業生機從新培養起來。」叧一位說：『這種展覽會，開在中外觀瞻的通商大埠，似乎獻醜，未免貽笑大方。』『不錯，」我說，「中國工業落後，是無可諱言的事實，但諱疾忌醫，是否根本辦法？是否我們技術圈裏兜兜的人的應處的態度？不怕獻醜和貽笑，正是主辦和參加這個工展的，的胆量。沒有問題人問題是在貽笑之後能不能急起直追。這我敢保證「中技」及塲內各廠商一定有這股勇氣的，「知恥」原是「近乎勇」呀！假使因這個幼稚的『工展』而盡了鼓吹中國工業化和促進中國工業的話，那末就完成了他的使命。至於「中技」眞正實幹的事業，還不是區區一個展覽會就算數了呀，不然，拿展覽會出出鋒頭就够了，何必再募什麼基金呢？</p>
<p>所以「工展」僅僅是我們的一個呼聲。</p>
<h3>「工展」感言</h3>
<p>— 施汶</p>
<p>現在不再有人懷疑，不再有人猶民；相反，代替了過去的恐惶，陰霾是興奮，有趣。多少的工作人員在他們的「工作者言」裏，表示了這個同一的感想。—誰不爲這熱烈的塲面憧憬！誰不爲這熱烈的塲面高興！</p>
<p>工作人員的崇高的忘我的精神在這個展覽會裏充份表現，他們犧牲了睡眠，犧牲了職業，或者功課，有的甚至最後連自己的健康也犧牲了。爲什麼這樣熱誠，這樣瘋在來爲展覧會努力？不是名，也不是利，是感應祖國的號召，他們覺得應該有舉行工業展覧的須要來作為全國工業化的號召。</p>
<p>是這個感應，把他們聯繫起來，親密得猶如一個家庭，各自守住了自己的崗位。一星期來，他們嘶破了喉嚨，站酸了腿，沒有怨言，沒有悔恨，每次總是熱烈地接受一天的任務。在這次裏，我們又一次　念到「人和」的可貴，並且我們史相信，任何艱苦困難的事情，只要團體一致，沒有不克服的。不相信嗎？吿訴你，展覽會確確實實依靠這個精神支撑起來。</p>
<p>第二是展覽會的舉行使整個的局勢　變，不容否認，在開始籌備的時候，大家對於中國技術協會都很生疎，就是許多關心我們的，也都爲這次憂慮，感謝廠商，感謝學術界，工業界，新聞界，學生界，承他們的協助展覽曾才能在今天圓滿閉幕。可是就是這樣技協約責任却因之增加了。因爲他已經是由聯誼性而成爲全國性的團體，換句話，他的地位是在這個會裏增高了。</p>
<p>舉辦工業品展覽會在今天不過是一個嘗試，所以許多地方都顯得不够充實，可是我們覺得在今天如果要提高學術內容，就不為適合一班水準，惟其是商品和工業的混合，才吸引了大批的觀衆，我們希望在今後能按照建國的程序，一次一次地把內容提高，把範團普遍起來。</p>
<h3>文化與工業</h3>
<p>— 寗夫</p>
<p>發揚文化，要把文化水準向上的提高我覺得還離不了工業的進步。單有文化人的頭腦，或者從事其他藝術方面的，但沒有相當工具，你憑什麽去發揚光大？</p>
<p>例子很容易，譬如寫文章，就得有支流利的筆，那支筆，是從那兒來啊？你的學術思想寫出來，就得用警鐘牌　紙和銅版，替你印發給人們讀和學。但舊的複印器太笨滯了，就得改用大明速印機，很迅速而淸晰的，使你的作品大量地散發開去。或是一本書的話，翻印了要保持版子，更得用大明實業廠出品　牌打版紙，製成紙版，以垂永久。</p>
<p>所以要是一位文化人，還得仰仗工業；要進步的工業來帮你的工作，才能事半功倍地完成你發揚文化的使命。</p>
<h3>工作者言</h3>
<p>外面下着傾盆大雨，有的地方馬路積水已經盈尺，但到會的來賓却並未因此减少。他們是那樣聚精會神地在蔡察着製造的過程，機械的，應用以及陳列着的一切，這說明了沒有什麼力量是可以阻止得了人們對於眞理的愛好和求知的慾望的。就一個工作者言，他覺得過去的努力是不無代價的，同時更相信祇要是爲了人類的進步和幸福，一切的努力都會獲得牠相當的收穫的，對於以後更艱難的工作，從這裏我們確是獲得了不小的鼓勵和更多的勇氣。—汪敏熙</p>
<p>「我們希望展覽會的內容是學術性的，有敎育意義的，使觀衆能獲得工業的常識，並喚起民衆對工業的注意。」這是本會會務部通函廠商徵求參加所說的話。</p>
<p>「廠方的佈置，假如偏重於廣吿，就失掉展覧會的意義了。看看登記表，眞使人擔心，大部份全寫此展覽品，如果變成一個百貨公司，那就糟了。」我們工作人員無不以此擔心。</p>
<p>「我們再動員公友向熟悉的廠商法接洽，說服並帮助他們設計。」</p>
<p>「我們會內也動員會友設計電機常識，機械常識，使展覽會內容充實。」這是我們開會的決議。</p>
<p>雖然我們從開始籌備迄今閉幕，工作態度始終如一，由於工作人員對於辦理展覽會，幷無豐富經騐，故處理籌備工作，極是謹愼。終屆三月廿四日開幕之期，而觀多數廠商所提供展覽成績，均附有生產過程，圖表的說明，機器實物的切面，此時我們工作人員的心情始漸輕鬆。我們深深的欽佩廠方與我木會的合作，這也是工廠界與技術人員第一次合作，希望同時是永久合作的象徵。—吳仲儀</p>
<p>名質業家姚于義　先生，昨日應本會之邀請，蒞臨參觀，承對於技協所辦的事業賜予深厚的鼓勵，並慨以鉅款，捐作技協經費。技協目前所感覺困難的會所和夜校校址間題，也承姚先生應允予以協助。這一筆送給技術人員以及中國技術建設的禮物，造福社會，是「技協」同人應　感謝的。</p>
<p>中國技術協會的會員，計包括化工，電工，機械，土木，紡織，鑛冶，農業，商業，數理等部門，分爲正會員，基本會員，初級會員，贊助會員等種。現熟烈的歡迎科學家，工程師，各級技術人員，技術專科學生加人爲會員。會章和過去史略在上海工業品展覽會特刋有詳細說明，單獨索閱會章，申請入會或其他事項，可投函上海陝西南路五三三號中國科學社轉中國技術協會。</p>

<h3>中國技術協會成立宣言</h3>
<p>中國技術協會，係出蘇聯誼社改組成立成立，其歷史已經一年六個月。這個團體，過去的事業，如工業（講座，工程界雜誌，中國技術專科夜校，已獲得社會的注意。而目上海工業品展覽會開幕以後，允引起國人的關心。茲將該會的成立宜言附刋於下，並祈技協約友人不吝賜予指導。</p>
<p>中國技術協會，於民國三十五年三月十七日在上海正式成立，願假這個機會，向全國人士申述我們的感想和願望。</p>
<p>「天下興亡，匹夫有責。」每個人對於國家，都有應　的義務。而且，「天下爲公」，國家爲國民所共有，人人均有其應予尊　的權利。中國飽經戰亂，我們極目河山，所見所聞，皆是遍地瘡　，生靈塗炭，每一個有良心有血性的中國人，孰能無動於中，而有感仔肩的艱重。本會會員，皆屬技術人員，在文盲衆多，民力衰疲的中國，獨獨很幸運地受有新敎育和新科學的洗禮，各有一技之長，際茲萬象復蘇，百廢待興之會，我們思考國情的需要，民間的呼求，允不敢妄自菲薄，深凛要以新術來服務新中國建設新中國，實應責無旁貸。</p>
<p>所以，我们組織起來了，我們揭起中國技術協會的旗幟，要替我們摯愛的祖國，號召鼓勵並且集合全國的技術人員同來參加這千載一時的建國大業，建國的工作千頭萬緒，我們所當努力的方向，一方面爲建設的促成，一方面爲人才的培養。爲了要促成建設，我們要期望每個技術人員，都投身於建國的洪流，各各貢獻他的技能，推進各部門的建設工作。我們主張培養人才就是希望國家能有源源不絕的技術的靑年軍，來繼承和發揚已成的建設基碮，惟有這樣不斷的訓練不斷的動員，一致的參與，一致的努力，於時間無一分一秒的荒怠，於人力無滴血滴汗的耗棄，而後我們的建國工作，才可以早早完成，而後我們休戚相關的同胞，才可以早早解脫苦難，獲致康樂。</p>
<p>當然，我們也不能忽視現實。抗戰勝利，迄今半載，我們深切地懷疑有無勝利果實的收穫。事實上，我們正爲民族工業的顚蹶而痛心，爲官僚資本的作集而疾首，為復員的滯緩，農民不能重理耕耘，工人被摒廠門以外，而不勝其焦慮，經濟建設計劃的渺茫而嘆息，但是痛心疾首，焦慮漢息，於事無補。不撥開雲層，看不見月光；不掃除荆棘，舖不出康莊的大道。每個人都是中國的主人，復興中國是義務，也是權利，爲了國家，也爲人民，我們應當盡力，將不合理的現象消除，把建國的機關車堆上軌道。我們要協助善良的民族工業家重興他的事業，我們要督促和擁護國家資本正當地健全地運用。我們所關心的，還有是農人回返家園，工人復歸工廠，交通的利暢，物價的低落和一個龐大的堅實的全國經濟建設計劃的實現。</p>
<p>當前的障　不能克服，則建設無由參與，無由促進，而人才的培養，也是徒勞。</p>
<p>今天，我們技術人員，認識得淸楚，參加建設新中國，不是一個職業，而是一個希，一個眞理。我們要抱着殉道渚的精神，獻出我們的學識，技能和力量，爲的要實現一個富强康樂的新中國。我們應該處處朝好處想，朝好處倣，却也不漠視艱難和陣阻。我們都是技術人員，都有愛國的忠誠，也都有呈于好的理想。爲了貫澈我們的忠誠，爲了實現我們的理想，我們相信集合在一起是有意義的。從今以後，對外我們以服務爲目標，對內則以團結爲任務。我們要做成一個健全純正的技術人員的團體，大家友好和睦，互助勉勵，培養眞誠的情誼，謀求彼此的福利，還要建樹共同的事業。</p>
<p>在艱苦困難的時期，中國的技術人員已經表現了良好的成績，相信今後的建國工作定必順利，技術人員的貢獻定必更有可觀。不過技術人員僅是建國的一環，所以我們還需要各方面的協助和合作。我們衷心地企求全國朝野上下，社會人士，予以熟烈的支持和愛護。</p>
<p>新的中國需要新的技術人員，新的技術人員要不自私，不盲從，不茍安，不投機；要有理想，有襟懷，有毅力，有氣節。中國技術協公今後便要發揚這種風氣，惟有在這種風氣裏，建國的力量才可以儘量發揮，建國大業才可以及早完成。不過，我們絕不誇張，我們只堅決相信：有一分熟，發一分光，燃料愈多，動力愈强。因此，在這煦和淸明的今天，我們敢於向全國的人士們呼籲：爲了中國，爲了企國的同胞，請伸出同情和互助的手來！</p>
<p>今當成立，謹此宣言。</p>

<h3>Top Military Mediation Officials Fly to Jinzhou to Arrange Negotiations Between the Nationalists and Communists; Mobile Teams Ready to Depart for Shenyang</h3>
<p>[Our Northern Plain Correspondent, 29th] The Executive Headquarters issued Announcement No. 20 on the 29th, stating that Brigadier General Byroade flew to Jinzhou on the 29th. He will stay briefly at the Northeast Headquarters to discuss everything with government officials and intends to arrange a meeting between the Nationalist and Communist authorities. Based on the basic principles agreed upon by the Military Affairs Trio, it was decided to first send four teams to Shenyang, leaving a central team in Shenyang to manage the liaison and communication between the teams. The head of this team is U.S. Colonel Detile. The locations of the other teams will be determined after arriving in Shenyang. It is also learned that the four teams will depart on the 30th, with Huang Jiexin, Wu Nengding, Cai Wenyu, and Chen Xianlü representing the government. Following this, a special plane will carry reporters there. The Chinese Communists will have a plane to Yan'an to pick up working cadres. Mediation Department representative Robertson is currently in Chongqing participating in the Trio talks.</p>
<p>[Our Chongqing Correspondent, 29th] The Executive Team dispatched by the Beiping Executive Headquarters is about to depart for the Northeast. General Zhang Zhizhong met with Zhou Enlai yesterday and had a candid conversation for over forty minutes, discussing the Northeast ceasefire issue and military conflicts in areas like Eastern Jiangxi and Northern Hubei. It is also learned that Zhang Zhizhong has gone to Xinjiang to take office, and the replacement to participate in the Military Affairs Trio conference to inspect the Northeast has not yet been decided. It is rumored that Zhang Qun will succeed him, but Zhang plans to go to Chengdu to handle provincial government affairs and is scheduled to return to Chongqing on the 30th.</p>
<p>[U.S. News Service, Northern Plain, 29th] The Mediation Executive Department's planned actions for the turbulent Northeast have already begun today. Brigadier General Byroade, the director of the department, left here on the morning of the 29th to prepare everything for the four mobile "ceasefire" teams soon to be dispatched to the Northeast. The goal is to establish a foundation and then resolve the difficult military issues in the Northeast provinces. The dispatch of the Executive Teams to the Northeast is a major step in the work of the Mediation Executive Department. Each Executive Team has been ordered by the committee to work only on military adjustments and must go to conflict areas or locations where Nationalist and Communist troops are in contact to promote a ceasefire and fair adjustments as needed. The four Executive Teams will initially remain in Shenyang, as it is easier to travel from that city to various dangerous areas. A major team will remain in Shenyang to maintain control and liaison with the departing teams. The work locations of the other teams will not be announced until the teams arrive in Shenyang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Northern Plain, 28th] The Executive Teams dispatched by the Executive Department, to date, total twenty-five teams. In addition, there are transportation teams responsible for reconstruction work and the four teams going to the Northeast, bringing the total to thirty-six teams.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Tianjin, 28th] The Beiping Military Mediation Department will dispatch the First Executive Team to Shenyang within two days and then send them to inspect various conflict locations within a thirty-mile radius around the city. The estimated number of non-government troops in the Northeast is 300,000. The main conflict area is around Shenyang, and large Nationalist troops have entered the area.</p>
<h3>Responsible Personnel of Various Northeast Agencies Leave Chongqing by Special Plane for Beiping; Northeast Headquarters Holds Meetings for Days</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Correspondent, 29th] It is learned that the responsible personnel of various agencies in the nine provinces and two municipalities of the Northeast, as well as the Northeast Branch of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), took fourteen special planes to Beiping this morning, from where they will proceed to the Northeast.</p>
<p>[Our Northern Plain Correspondent, 29th] The Northeast Headquarters personnel were originally scheduled to arrive in Shenyang on the 25th, but due to holding review meetings for days, the date has been changed to the 5th of next month. The complete move to Shenyang will have to wait a while, as the housing is not yet ready. Liang Huasheng, Deputy Commander of the Northeast Headquarters, will go to Changchun within a day or two. Zhao Jiaxiang, Chief of Staff, went to Shenyang on official business on the morning of the 29th and will return to Zhen on the 30th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 29th] Huang Yanping flew back here from Jinzhou at 2:00 PM on the 29th. Zhu Xinmin, a member of the delegation, returned with him. Reception personnel returning from Changchun to Jinzhou are not allowed to enter the customs without Xiong Wangren's approval but must transfer to Shenyang and other places to participate in the reception work.</p>
<p>[Our Changchun Correspondent, 28th] Your correspondent arrived in Changchun from Harbin last night. The Northeast Headquarters at the Mantan Building presents a bleak scene, filled with tension. Various reception personnel are leaving in succession, and most of the headquarters staff have also gone to Jinzhou to work. However, the military delegation has remained here in its entirety. Delegation leader Dong Yanping went to Jinzhou on official business yesterday. The delegation is preparing to advance north with the Soviet troops. Rumors are circulating in the city that Communist troops will besiege the urban area on a certain day, so the security forces remaining here cannot but make defense plans. Sandbags are piled up at various important strongholds, creating a state of wartime. The situation is very tense, with many gunshots heard in the suburbs last night. Four trucks falsely using headquarters license plates were also intercepted yesterday. A civil war is about to break out here, and the people are at a loss. However, last night's broadcast from Beiping reported that the Jinzhou Northeast Headquarters is still studying how to unify reception methods, perhaps to stabilize people's hearts. Harbin is outwardly calm, and the Soviet troops have not yet withdrawn. Communist troops surround the four suburbs. Not a single soldier is in Songjiang or Harbin. Although the former Soviet troops have expressed responsibility for maintaining order, your correspondent observes that when the Soviet troops withdraw and our troops have not yet arrived, Harbin and Songjiang Province will be handed over without a fight, or there will be no war. Furthermore, the murderer of Li Zhaolin has been apprehended. His name is Kong Qingyun, a native of Liaoning. According to his confession, it was to avenge a personal grudge from when he organized the anti-Japanese army. The Harbin municipal government has transferred Kong to the Soviet military for continued interrogation. Furthermore, Zhang Xingbang, the bandit leader of Harbin, was executed by hanging on the 28th, greatly pleasing the people.</p>
<h3>The Entire Eastern Section of the Longhai Railway is Repaired; Opening to Traffic Still Awaits Agreement; Jinan-Dezhou Highway Begins Operation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 29th] According to sources in the transportation sector, the Xuhai section of the Eastern Longhai Road will soon be completed and will be open to the country in five days. The road repair work on the Jinpu and Pinghan lines is proceeding slowly due to continued obstructions, with some sections taking three days to complete one kilometer. It is heard that the Beiping Military Mediation Department is considering forming a special transportation team to fly to various locations for inspection to address the current difficulties.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 29th] The entire Eastern section of the Longhai Railway has been repaired, but the issue of opening to traffic still awaits agreement. Furthermore, the Communist army has admitted that they individually controlled the Eastern section of the Longhai after the ceasefire order took effect.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 29th] The three-party representatives of the Military Mediation Department's Jiaoji Railway Gaomi Team have held eight meetings, but have consistently failed to obtain the Communist Party representatives' consent to start road repairs. The Military Mediation Department has specially dispatched the Railway Management Section Chief to fly from Beiping to Qingdao on the 29th for on-site inspection.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 29th] The road repair situation north of Yancheng is good and is expected to reach Yucheng within a week and Dexian within two months. This emergency repair work is proceeding very quickly. However, the areas where railway workers go must be inspected by Communist troops.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 28th] The Jinan-Zhengzhou highway is open to traffic. According to passengers, the route is generally safe, with only one inspection by the Communist army near Pingyuan. Identification documents issued by military and government agencies were torn up by them, but there were no incidents of detention. The second phase of traffic operations began on the 28th with the sale of passenger and freight tickets.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Northern Plain, 28th] The Dongqin Team dispatched by the Executive Department flew by special plane to Taiyuan this morning to transfer to Dongqin for work.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 29th] The Communist Party recently arbitrarily changed Puyang County into a city and established a so-called Bureau of Industry and Commerce to manipulate industry and commerce. Seven distilleries have closed down, and tobacco merchants have been forced to reduce prices and sell at a loss. Grain merchants are also suffering similar devastation.</p>
<h3>Many Factories in Jinan are Closed; Authorities Will Assist in Resumption of Work</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Correspondent, 29th] Before the war, Jinan's industrial development ranked second in Shandong Province, only after Qingdao. Most of these were cotton mills and flour mills. Except for some destruction during the enemy puppet era, they were generally able to maintain their integrity. After the victory, due to the Communist army's blockade, raw materials and fuel sources were difficult to obtain. In addition, most of the Japanese technicians have been sent back to their country, causing the factories to fall into a state of suspension. Currently, less than ten percent of the factories are in operation, and the number of unemployed workers is increasing daily. The authorities have recently begun to pay attention to this and will soon start an investigation to prepare to assist manufacturers in resuming work.</p>
<h3>Government Reorganization Expected in Early April</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Correspondent, 29th] It is learned that representatives from all parties of the Political Consultative Conference have been frequently negotiating for days, indicating that the expansion of the government will be realized soon. Official sources also stated that the government is expected to be reorganized around the 10th of next month, but the list of candidates from each party to participate in the government must be submitted by the end of this month; otherwise, the reorganization date will still be delayed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th] As the National Government is about to return to its capital, President Chiang is also going to Nanjing. People in the wartime capital have launched a commemorative movement to express their respect and admiration for President Chiang. The Chongqing Municipal Council and various people's organizations are meeting to discuss the arrangements, which will be finalized within a week.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Municipal National Assembly Representatives Should Include One Female Representative; Elections Begin in Early Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Correspondent, 29th] The number of National Assembly representatives for Chongqing Municipality has been approved by the Central Government as six, and elections will be held in early next month. All municipal councilors will be the electors, and candidates are free to participate. Registration starts today and ends on the 31st. Among the six representatives, three are regional representatives and three are professional representatives, and it is stipulated that there should be one female representative. It is heard that there are quite a few people planning to register.</p>

<p>"To His Excellency Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the Republic of China, from May 1943 to September 1945, for his distinguished leadership of the Chinese nation in its resistance against Japanese aggression. Shortages of aircraft, modern weapons, and other vital materiel created almost insurmountable difficulties, but His Excellency Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek steadfastly persevered, inspiring Chinese forces to hold their ground and to inflict heavy losses upon more than a million enemy troops over vast areas and rugged terrain in China. His resolute determination to expel the enemy from the mainland of China culminated in ultimate victory, forcing the Japanese to retreat, surrender, and end the war. His courage, ingenuity, political skill, and unswerving faith that final victory would reward his long-suffering people contributed in no small measure to the success of the Allied war effort."</p>

<h3>Councilors Review Reception Work; Suggest Organizing Committee to Thoroughly Investigate Reception and Handling of Materials</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th] The various review committees of the Council of Political Affairs, except for the Third Special Review Committee, continued to meet this morning to review proposals. The Third Special Review Committee was originally scheduled to hold a meeting tonight, but due to a conflict with the meeting time of the Fourth Review Committee, it has been changed to 8:00 PM tomorrow night.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th] The Council of Political Affairs held its thirteenth meeting at 3:20 PM on the 29th. Weng Wenhao and Yu Feipeng attended to answer questions regarding economic and transportation reports and to review issues regarding the reception of enemy puppet materials and industries. Chairman Wang Yunwu attended. 192 councilors were present. After the Secretariat reported, Ministers Weng and Yu provided written answers to the various inquiries and then gave oral responses. Weng first explained the reason why China does not mine gold but uses U.S. dollars, saying that it was because the government adopted a gold policy to recover legal tender, and therefore borrowed heavily from the United States. Moreover, the cost of gold mining increased with commodity prices, and many of China's gold mines are currently closed. Weng also said that the reason why factories in the rear closed down and many factories in the front had not resumed work was due to inconvenient transportation and the significant impact of inflation, with many difficulties. However, the government had actively tried to help the factories in the rear, and the government would naturally strengthen its efforts to resume work in the factories in the front. Minister Yu answered the question of whether transportation enterprises should be state-owned or privately-owned, saying that laws such as the Railway Law already stipulated that those belonging to the national scope should be state-owned in principle. Local transportation should be operated by local governments and private enterprises. Highways, waterways, and air transport can also be state-owned or privately-owned. Yu continued, saying that the cancellation of the registration of China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) was decided by the Executive Yuan, perhaps due to the reasons of registered routes and foreign exchange. He then explained the reasons for black market train tickets and slow telegrams. Councilors Li Zhongnang and Xu Deheng proposed that the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway should be restored as soon as possible, and Duanmu Kai questioned the CNAC case, saying that the government should value the rights of the people. Minister Yu replied that he would submit this opinion to the government for decision. After a ten-minute break, the meeting continued to review the issue of receiving enemy puppet materials and industries. First, the proposer, Liu Shumo, explained the reason for the proposal. The councilors then spoke in succession, summarizing the main points as follows: In Jinan, factories that were received are stealing and selling raw materials. How should labor unrest in the rear, such as the Daduhe case, be handled? Those who are corrupt in the reception work should be severely punished. The reception situation in Guangzhou, Hainan Island, Taiwan, and other places is chaotic, evolving into a competition between large and small agencies, a competition between agencies and the people. Air Force reception of farms has ships without coal and cars without gasoline, and superiors and subordinates deceive each other, competing for profits. These malpractices have greatly affected the government's credibility. Councilor Wang Puhan and others advocated organizing an investigation team to thoroughly investigate the situation of enemy puppet materials received in various places. Finally, the meeting decided: (1) To recommend that the government organize a committee to investigate the reception and handling of enemy puppet materials, and the organizational methods will be formulated by the presidium and submitted to the general meeting for approval. (2) Reports from councilors on cases of corruption in reception in various places will be sent to the government for investigation and handling. The meeting adjourned at 6:50 PM.</p>

<h3>U.S. Military Advisory Group to Stay in China for Five Years, Helping China Build a Modern Army, Group of Young Officers to Go to the U.S. for Training in August</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] Major General McClure, head of the U.S. Military Advisory Group in China, told United Press reporters today that the group is currently in the organizational stage and will be formally established before or after the dissolution of the China Theater. He said that the group includes various departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and its headquarters will be located in Nanjing, the capital of China, maintaining close contact with the Chinese Military Affairs Commission. Representatives will also be assigned to important troops and training centers throughout the country. He said that the group, at the invitation of Chairman Chiang, will stay in China for at least five years, and the stay can be extended if the Chinese government needs it afterwards. The group's goal is to help modernize the Chinese army and completely change the Chinese people's perception of modern national defense forces. General McClure believes that it is most important for China to focus on equipping a small but modern army, navy, and air force, infantry, and long-range artillery, because armored units are not suitable for operating in the mountains of North China and the rice paddies of South China. Air force bomber squadrons are also important because their function is equivalent to long-range artillery. He believes that China lacks the economic and industrial strength to maintain a modern navy, but the navy cannot be ignored, and the training of Chinese sailors has already begun in Qingdao by U.S. Navy personnel. He believes that in building a new modern national defense force in China, the training, supply, leadership, and quality of the army are more important than quantity. Improving these aspects will be the main task of the U.S. Military Advisory Group in China.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Today, authoritative sources here revealed that the Chinese government is planning to send 350 young army, navy, and air force officers to the United States for one year of training in August. After completion, they will return to the country and serve as instructors in 22 military schools throughout the country. These sources pointed out that General Marshall's plan to reduce the Chinese army to 60 divisions by September 1, 1947, requires a large number of well-trained officers. Establishing 22 military officer schools will help achieve this goal. The 350 young officers going to the United States for training will become the core of these military schools. It is heard that the examination of these candidates will begin soon, and will be specifically handled by the U.S. authorities in China.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 29th Dispatch] In order to accurately understand the actual situation of troops throughout the country and prepare for army reorganization, the Ministry of Military Affairs has specially dispatched liaison officers to be stationed in various armies throughout the country, responsible for liaison and inspection, and will conduct detailed investigations on the military discipline, personnel, horses, weapons, ammunition, office supplies, in-kind supplies, and uniforms and equipment of various armies throughout the country, and report them to the ministry for record.

<h3>U.S. Bureau of Reclamation Designs Grand Dam on the Yangtze River, Estimated Cost of 1 Billion Yuan, Taking 5-6 Years, Large Ships Pass Through the Dam Using Cranes</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Denver, Colorado, 28th Dispatch] Designers at the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation are currently drawing up plans for the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River in China. Savage, the design director of the bureau, has completed the draft. The Boulder Dam in the United States, which is the world's leading dam, was designed by Savage. Savage is currently a consulting engineer for the Chinese government. The U.S. assistance to China in building the Three Gorges Dam is limited to design work, and the Chinese government will pay 500,000 yuan. The main purposes of building the Yangtze River Dam are to utilize hydropower for power generation and to facilitate irrigation. However, the people in the Yangtze River basin will benefit from more than this, because after the dam is completed, the Yangtze River will no longer flood, and the people will not have to suffer from displacement. The construction of the dam is estimated to cost 1 billion yuan and may take five to six years to complete. However, once built, it will overshadow other dams. The dam will be built in the middle of the Yichang basin, reaching a height of 750 feet, which is 24 feet higher than the Boulder Dam, and can stop 250 miles of water flow. This water flow can irrigate 10 million acres of farmland. Its power generation is three times greater than the combined power generation of the Boulder Dam, the Grand Coulee Dam in Washington State, and the Shasta Dam. It is expected that the cost of building the dam will be compensated for by this electricity. According to Savage's plan, after the dam is built, navigation on the Yangtze River will not be hindered. Large ships passing through the dam can be lifted by cranes and then placed on the waterway. As for sampans and small boats, they will be placed in huge metal buckets and lifted over the dam, like fish in a net. Savage once said with a smile: "I will feel disappointed if no one says 'this method cannot be realized'." According to the contract between the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and the Chinese government, the bureau will provide a final report on preliminary research, hydraulic tests, pressure and stability design, and the amount of funds required. It is reported that the chief engineer in charge of the dam design in Denver is Young.</p>

Now, the provincial government has issued a special arrest warrant. The local county government has ordered its subordinates to fully cooperate in the arrest, ensuring his capture and transfer.</p>

<p>Lei Yunsheng's Owner Accused of Embezzlement</p>
<p>The Huafeng Money Exchange, located at No. 6 Guanqian Street, Suzhou, was established during the enemy occupation in the 27th year of the Republic of China. It expanded its business in the 31st year, and the shareholders' meeting elected Lei Xianzhis as the general manager. Lei is the owner of the Xiaoyunsheng Pharmacy, residing at No. 77 Miaotang Lane, Suzhou. After the victory last year, the exchange and the Shanghai Shen Exchange suspended business in October. All office equipment and furnishings in Suzhou and Shanghai were sold for 100,000 and 200,000 yuan respectively. Shareholder Zhang Bibo accused Lei of disposing of assets without the consent of all shareholders, and filed a lawsuit in the local court's criminal division, accusing Lei Xianzhis of embezzlement. On the 25th of this month, Judge Han summoned both parties for questioning. As witnesses still need to be summoned, the hearing was postponed. It has been learned that the local court yesterday summoned Zheng Zhiping, Jiang Mutao, Liu Shoumei, and others to testify, and the hearing is scheduled to resume at 1:00 PM on April 1st.</p>

<p>Provincial Order Reduces Military Grain Quota</p>
<p>The provincial government is urgently pressing for the requisition of military grain. On the 26th, Commissioner Pan was sent to Jiangyin, bringing a check for 60 million yuan. After meeting with County Magistrate Fang, and being deeply sympathetic to the difficulties faced by the people of Jiangyin, the provincial government reduced the original quota of 50,000 shi (unit of volume) to 24,000 shi, as a gesture of compassion. County Magistrate Fang strongly argued that industry and commerce were depressed, and the people had no surplus grain. He requested Commissioner Pan to report back to the provincial government to seek a full exemption, in order to alleviate the people's suffering.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Iran and the United Nations</h3>
<p>The United Nations, as an institution, is now facing an unprecedented crisis. Whether this crisis can be safely overcome, resolving various difficulties, and continue to move forward on the path of maintaining world peace depends on how the Iranian issue is resolved in the future. The Security Council meeting on the 27th was abruptly adjourned when the Soviet representative's request to postpone the discussion of the Iranian issue was not accepted. Although the meeting continued, listening to the Iranian representative's report on the dispute over the Soviet withdrawal, the absence of the Soviet Union from the eleven-member council was still a drawback. The British cabinet held a meeting the next day to review the new situation caused by this. The US President stated that he fully supported US Secretary of State Byrnes' position and was not concerned about the possibility of the Soviet Union withdrawing from the Security Council. The development of the situation to this point shows that the differences of opinion among the victorious countries after the Second World War have reached a serious degree on the surface. The safety of the world and the welfare of mankind are now closely related, and we cannot help but turn our attention to the Iranian issue that caused the dispute, and the importance of how the United Nations will handle this issue in the future is worthy of people's attention.</p>
<p>Regarding the Iranian issue, when the United Nations convened in London last year, the Iranian government filed a complaint with the United Nations. After a war of words, during which there were indeed many interesting scenes to watch, the issue was handed over to Iran and the Soviet Union for direct negotiations. At the same time, the autonomous movement in Azerbaijan Province occurred, and the Iranian government, in order to preserve the integrity of Iran's territory and sovereignty, was unwilling to make excessive concessions. Therefore, although the Iranian Prime Minister made a trip to Moscow, no agreement was reached. Although the British and American troops stationed in Iran withdrew as scheduled on March 2, the Soviet Union not only did not withdraw its troops but also showed signs of increasing its troops in Iran. As a result, the Iranian government once again filed a complaint with the United Nations. Unexpectedly, just three hours before the United Nations Security Council meeting, the Soviet Union suddenly announced its troop withdrawal. On the one hand, the Soviet Union requested the United Nations Security Council to postpone the meeting, and on the other hand, after the request was not granted, it suddenly announced two hours before the meeting, to deal with this international gathering in a new form. Therefore, at the first meeting of the Security Council, the Soviet representative opposed including the Iranian issue on the agenda and announced that the Soviet army would continue to withdraw from Iran from March 24, and that unless an "unexpected event" occurred, the withdrawal of the Soviet army could be completed within five or six weeks.</p>
<p>However, the United States' view is different from that of the Soviet Union. US Secretary of State Byrnes stated at the Security Council meeting that Iran had submitted the above-mentioned issue to the Security Council and pointed out that the Soviet Union's actions had threatened world security and peace. The Iranian Ambassador to the United States wrote to the US government on March 18, stating that the Soviet army continued to be stationed in Iran after March 2 and interfered in Iran's internal affairs. Although the Soviet Union has now claimed to have reached an agreement with Iran, since the Soviet Union and Iran have not jointly issued a statement to the Security Council, we should not refuse to listen to the debate on the Iranian issue. British representative Jebb also stated that the British side fully agreed with Byrnes's claim. At this point, the Soviet representative had to take delaying measures again. Seeing that the postponement of the Security Council meeting had been rejected, and the failure to include the Iranian issue on the agenda had not been approved by the General Assembly, the Soviet Union requested that the Iranian issue be discussed again on April 10, and then made a threat: If the General Assembly discusses the Iranian issue before April 10, the Soviet side will withdraw from the meeting. As a result, the meeting formed a serious deadlock, and the Soviet representative finally stormed out of the meeting in anger. It is still unknown whether they will attempt to break the situation outside the meeting in the future.</p>
<p>What is noteworthy is Iran's attitude. According to a Reuters dispatch from New York on the 27th, the Iranian Ambassador to the United States, Ala, has been authorized by the Iranian government to protest to the Security Council against the continued occupation of northern Iran by the Soviet army and interference in Iran's internal affairs. The Soviet representative expressed doubt at the Security Council meeting as to whether Ambassador Ala was authorized to speak on behalf of the Iranian government, but the Iranian side pointed out that Ambassador Ala had maintained constant contact with Tehran in the past few days. A dispatch from Tehran also confirmed that the Iranian government had not reached an agreement to resolve the dispute. According to a report from this newspaper, according to London Broadcasting, the Iranian Prime Minister denied that he had reached a new agreement with the Soviet Union on the issue of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Iran; this statement seems to be quite reliable, because the Iranian side has never agreed to postpone the Security Council's discussion of the Iranian issue. Observers believe that the Soviet Union's reasons for requesting a postponement are twofold: (1) The negotiations on the Iranian oil production issue may be concluded before April 10; (2) The reorganization of the Iranian government and the status of Azerbaijan may have been decided by then.</p>
<p>From the above reports, we can see the direction of the Iranian situation. From the perspective of the United Nations, the Iranian issue is a touchstone for the United Nations as an institution. Whether the United Nations as an institution can maintain lasting world peace depends on how this Iranian issue is resolved. From a legal point of view, this Iranian issue was a complaint filed by the Iranian government with the United Nations, and the Iranian government has not withdrawn this complaint. Therefore, the Security Council should proceed with the discussion as usual and should not postpone it because of the Soviet Union's attitude. If a puppet regime appears in Iran in the future, it will make this Iranian issue more complicated. At this moment, it is inevitable for the United Nations as an institution to express its position righteously and sternly. It must be understood that there are many problems like the Iranian issue that are brewing in the world. If the Iranian issue cannot be resolved reasonably and legally in the United Nations, and cannot be based on justice and adherence to treaties to maintain international peace, then the world will still be a world dominated by power politics, and the goals of the Atlantic Charter and the United Nations Charter will be farther and farther away. Although we do not want to say that the seeds of a future world war will be sown in these places, the result of the great powers being driven by selfish motives, leading to a loss of rationality, will inevitably cause the world's human beings to suffer an unprecedented disaster in the atomic age. We eagerly hope for world peace and eagerly hope for human justice. May the United Nations and the countries, large and small, participating in the United Nations, truly open their hearts and minds, treat each other with sincerity, stand on an equal footing, and resolve all international disputes, not only the Iranian issue. Although the League of Nations in the past was incompetent, it still had the Lytton Report, which made the truth of the Northeast situation known to the world. The United Nations as an institution is what all mankind expects, and it has a heavy responsibility to maintain world peace. In the face of the difficult situation of the Iranian issue, it should make a strong performance!</p>

<h3>Huanghuagang Martyrs' Memorial Day, Various Agencies in the City Jointly Held a Memorial Meeting in the Auditorium of the Provisional Council, Recalling the Origin of the Fruits of Victory, the Achievements of the Martyrs Cannot Be Erased</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday was the Huanghuagang Martyrs' Memorial Day. The Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Songhu Garrison Command, the Three People's Principles Youth League, the Shanghai Provisional Council, and other organizations jointly held a memorial meeting at 9:00 AM yesterday in the auditorium of the Council at No. 111 Nanchang Road. Mayor Qian, Li Ji, Guan, and other government leaders, as well as more than one hundred provisional councilors attended. The ceremony was simple and solemn. The councilors' and guests' seats in the venue were removed, and everyone stood in line solemnly. Mayor Qian served as chairman, briefly recounted the martyrdom of the Huanghuagang martyrs, and delivered a speech saying:</p>
<p>Mayor Qian's Speech</p>
<p>"Today, when we commemorate the revolutionary martyrs, in accordance with the central government's regulations, we are not only commemorating the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang, but also all revolutionary martyrs, whether they died for the country or died from overwork, are all commemorated on this day. Therefore, the significance of this memorial day is even greater. Especially this year, which is the first year after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, we are here to commemorate the martyrs, witnessing the achievement of victory, and recalling the origin of this achievement. We must be concerned about the preservation and promotion of this achievement, feel grateful for the past, and encourage the future. All kinds of emotions arise at the same time, and we feel the greatness and importance of this meaning even more. To be worthy of, and to repay the martyrs who sacrificed for the country, the most important thing is to inherit their unfinished ambitions, realize the Three People's Principles, and create a prosperous and strong new China. Looking back at the general situation today, the distance from the martyrs' goals is still far away. Therefore, I hope that all compatriots across the country will stand on their respective positions and work hard separately. Those of us who are handling Shanghai's municipal administration should make earnest efforts to build a glorious and splendid new Shanghai. At the same time, I hope that all councilors will give practical guidance and practical assistance in order to complete our common mission, so that we will not fail to live up to the meaning of our revolutionary martyrs' memorial."</p>
<p>Speaker Xu's Speech</p>
<p>Then, Speaker Xu Jiguang delivered a speech, briefly saying: "Today is the Revolutionary Martyrs' Memorial Day. It is the memorial day of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang who threw their heads and shed their blood for the sake of overthrowing the thousands of years of monarchical autocracy and for the sake of fighting for democracy and freedom. I have two points that I want to report to you and encourage you to work together. First, the nine-year sacred and great War of Resistance Against Japan finally ended in victory. The Shanghai Provisional Council was also established not long after the victory. We are able to gather here today to hold a meeting and commemorate. When drinking water, we must think of the source. We must not forget the revolutionary martyrs who led the way for the people and sacrificed their lives for blood. In today's memorial meeting, let us silently think about how we should sincerely accept their gifts. Second, our country has now jumped from a shameful semi-colonial status to become one of the world's four major powers. But if we think carefully, can our military, economic, political...various conditions really be on par with the world's powers? If our conditions are not enough, this is very dangerous. We should be deeply vigilant, unite our efforts from top to bottom, and catch up in order to avoid falling from the position of a first-class country. Today our slogan should be to move forward on the bloodstained footsteps of the martyrs, work hard and strive to build a new China." After the speech, the meeting was adjourned at 9:30 AM.</p>
<h3>City Provisional Council Holds First Meeting Today</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The City Provisional Council is scheduled to hold its first general meeting at 9:00 AM today to begin discussing various proposals. In the afternoon, the Mayor will hold a tea party in the Municipal Government conference room to entertain all councilors and invite relevant agency personnel to participate. After the council opened, the most intense work outside the council for each councilor was to discuss and prepare proposals.

<p>Tradition Calls for Improvement of Material Rationing</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Councilor Tong Xian and others plan to submit two proposals: (1) Requesting the government to allocate 30% of the education funds to the Shanghai education community to restore and develop the city's education, and to allocate a portion of it to subsidize private schools so that they can continue to maintain themselves. (2) Requesting the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to use all the proceeds from the sale of materials for relief purposes and not to take it as the administrative expenses of the agency. At the same time, it is proposed that although the various materials sold by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration are called fair prices, they are actually not much different from market prices, and there are also uneven distribution issues. In the future, they should be distributed to each household in the city according to the population.</p>
<p>Local Autonomy Association Provides 20 Opinions</p>

The Secretariat of the Council telegraphed the Executive Yuan yesterday afternoon to request instructions on a separate replacement. According to the election rules, Zhao's vacancy should be filled by the third alternate councilor, Yu Jieqing, (the first alternate councilor, He Bingsong, has already filled the vacancy of Pan Gongqing).

<h3>Industrial Products Exhibition, Last Day Today</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Industrial Products Exhibition organized by the China Technology Association has been welcomed by all sectors since its opening. Although there has been wind and rain for days, the number of citizens who went to visit is still in the tens of thousands every day. Today is the last day of the exhibition. Citizens will not want to miss this last opportunity, so the crowded situation must be even worse than on other days. Yesterday, the association hosted leaders from all walks of life. Tian Gan, Wang Tian, Min Shufen, and other four people accompanied the delegation to visit the entire venue. The "China Technology Association" hired Hu Xiguo, Cao Huiqun, Yang Ju, Zhao Zukang, Gu Yixiu, Zhao Hui, and other five people as evaluation committee members to determine the results of each participating unit. The association will award certificates to the most outstanding performers.</p>
<h3>Police Officers Must Not Check Pedestrians Without Orders</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to a secret report from the Municipal Police Department, recently, the captains of various branches and police teams under the department have often intercepted pedestrians and military vehicles arbitrarily without orders while on duty, and privately inspected them, extorting them on the pretext. This is especially true in the suburbs. The authorities of the bureau believe that this kind of out-of-bounds action not only tarnishes the reputation of the police but also harms the citizens. Therefore, they ordered their subordinates to investigate and ban it in order to reassure merchants and travelers. If police officers have the above-mentioned behavior in the future, once it is verified, they will be severely punished without leniency, and it is hoped that the victims will secretly report and report at any time.</p>
<h3>Enormous Object, Comes and Goes Suddenly, Pan American Airlines "Constellation" Airliner, Flies from the US to Shanghai, Only Takes 33 Hours</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Pan American Airlines airliner "Constellation" that arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday flew from Shanghai to the US again at 10:30 AM yesterday, without carrying passengers or cargo. The aircraft set a new record for post-war aviation flights over the Pacific, taking 33 hours and 27 minutes from the US to Shanghai. During the return trip, it will pass through the Aleutian Islands and Ayon Island to test whether the northern route is applicable. It is said that the plane originally planned to stay in Shanghai for three days to check the engine, but took off and returned to the US early for some reason. The plane brought 44 passengers, including 21 technical personnel from the "United Relief Administration," Yuan Te, vice president of China Aviation Corporation, three personnel from Pan American Airlines, and four members of the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation. The plane was slightly delayed in Tokyo due to bad weather. This flight achievement was unexpected. The plane has a huge fuselage and is equipped with four engines. It is one of the six airliners leased by the "United Relief Administration." It will fly between the US and China once a week to speed up the transport of the main personnel of the "United Relief Administration" to China to assist our country in promoting relief and rehabilitation work. The picture shows the "Constellation" that arrived in Shanghai from the US in 33 hours and 27 minutes with its passengers.</p>

<h3>From a Row of Neat Boots and Shoes, Their Entire Lives are Revealed. A Group of Innocent and Lively Girls and Women Simply Do Not Want to Return. The Women's Auxiliary Corps in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Reporter Fang Dan</p>
<p>"Our Newspaper Special" When you are strolling down the street and see American Jeeps speeding between trams and cars, have you ever noticed that the drivers of those Jeeps are also smiling women? Wearing the same green woolen uniforms, only with skirts below; the same rank insignia on their arms or collars; the same jaunty boat-shaped hats, but beneath them, beautiful and charming faces; and hands on the steering wheel with manicured and red-painted nails. They are just as strong and brave, just as full of joyful enthusiasm; for the enthusiasm for work, they crossed the Pacific Ocean, crossed the "Hump," and came to wartime China in 1944.</p>
<p>They are the Women's Auxiliary Corps (Women Army Corps), assisting the American military in their work. There are over a hundred of them. They first arrived in Chongqing, where they lived in the American headquarters within Qiujing Middle School in Chongqing. After the victory, a small number were transferred to Guangzhou, and the majority moved to Shanghai with the American headquarters. At this time, there are a total of over eighty left in Shanghai, working for the American military as secretaries, typists, stenographers, and photographers.</p>
<p>A neat building on Judah Road, with balconies and lawns, originally a private residence of a Japanese banker, now serves as their headquarters. Downstairs are the dining room, living room, and lounge; the second and third floors are bedrooms. Stoves are everywhere, burning warmly. Although there is no sign that says "Men are Prohibited" at the staircase, just by looking at the expectant eyes of two young G.I.s in the waiting room under the stairs, it is clear that meetings must take place in the waiting room. The lounge is connected to the guest room, with comfortable and large sofas, a radio, and illustrated magazines. After coming out of the dining room, they sit down in the lounge to blow smoke rings and listen to music.</p>
<p>"Having traveled so far to China, do you miss home?" "No! Not at all!" This is an extremely frank and unadorned answer. In their country, the call for demobilization, aren't labor strikes surging? Women who came out into society during the war, replacing men, will not only be squeezed back into their families, but also suffer from the unemployment of their husbands or lovers. Now working for the American military in China, their food, clothing, and accommodation are all provided. Although the salary is not high (at least fifty yuan per month), they can buy cheap things at the P.X., where they can buy everything from lipstick and powder to food and toys. Now in America, girls are panicking about stockings, but at this time in Shanghai, as long as they have money, they can still buy them. "Do you encounter difficulties when shopping on the street?" "Of course, and sometimes you have to bargain." They say Shanghai is somewhat similar to New York, but perhaps that is where New York and Shanghai are not alike!</p>
<p>What explains their entire lives is the bedroom, the row of shoes arranged neatly under each bed: the clunky, sturdy boots, for running around on the street on rainy days; the half-heeled ordinary shoes, which are often worn with uniforms; the two or three pairs of delicate shoes with heels three inches off the ground, which make one think of wearing bare-shouldered evening gowns on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays, aside from the neat and pressed uniforms, and twirling on the dance floor. Among these shoes that have traveled across the ocean, there are also Japanese-style clogs, which are used for bathing; even more, there are satin embroidered flat shoes trimmed with fur, which is where they appreciate this mysterious and ancient country when they come to China. "Do you like these shoes?" "Oh! They are extremely comfortable to wear!" Their satisfaction, without having to search beneath their long eyelashes, is already overflowing in their sweet tone.</p>
<p>From those hand-embroidered satin shoes to the exquisite high-heeled shoes that have traveled from afar, it also shows how far apart the two countries are! And they, these dozens of girls, live in the harmony of this distance, feeling comfortable, feeling satisfied, and they are about to "forget about their homeland in the joy of being here!"</p>
<p>On the beds covered with army blankets, there are large dolls; on the bookshelves, below are neat and crisp foreign books, but above are some so-called Chinese antiques, small figurines, small horses, and delicate potted landscapes, collected for them by Jewish merchants on Xiafei Road.</p>
<p>Managing them is Captain Rose Wagner, who has a very elegant and generous demeanor, and is also so young. "Do the girls get up regularly at six in the morning?" "Not necessarily. If they come back late at night, they can be more flexible." She replied with a smile. When she pointed out the white screen for showing movies, she said with a bit of humor: "There are movies here to keep the girls at home!" She also mentioned that the WAC girls are all unmarried.</p>
<p>At the beginning of next month, thirty of them will be able to return to their country, which should be a happy thing, but for them, it is not necessarily so. They have already regarded Shanghai as the New York of the East!</p>
<h3>The Three Public Guilds Telegraphically Request the Return of Remaining Seized Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>The three public guilds of dyeing, weaving, cotton cloth, and yarn in this city have all been reorganized and convened their founding assembly. At that time, member representatives of each industry all raised proposals regarding the case of requesting the return of yarn and cloth forcibly requisitioned by the enemy and their puppets from the enemy property disposal authorities, and each entrusted the council of directors of the public guild to handle the matter with full authority and continue to strive for it. Yesterday, the three public guilds also sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan, providing their opinions: (1) The yarn and cloth were indeed forcibly purchased by the enemy and their puppets by relying on their power, and were not sold willingly. It seems that it should be deemed invalid in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Law. (2) The forced purchase price was less than 25% of the market price at the time. After three years, a quarter of the price has not yet been paid. This portion of yarn and cloth for which the price has not been paid should be reviewed with consideration and returned. (3) Although the enemy and their puppets stipulated at the time that a quarter of the price would be issued in the form of bonus money, the speed at which the price of yarn and cloth rose was far above the bonus money. It should be considered that businesses are in dire straits and be approved for return. (4) Among the remaining yarn and cloth, there is no yarn or cloth from enemy merchants. There is no difficulty in dividing what belongs to the enemy and what belongs to the merchants when returning it. (5) It is inevitable that checking and returning will be difficult due to repeated movements by the enemy and their puppets or the fact that the puppet merchant unified association has mixed things up a lot when handing them over. It is hoped that a reasonable method will be determined for remedy, but for a portion of the yarn and cloth that was ordered by the enemy and their puppets to be kept by the original households, and the original items are still there, it should be requested that it be approved for return as soon as possible. (6) After suffering this catastrophe, dyeing and weaving factories, cotton cloth stores, and yarn stores have declared bankruptcy in countless numbers. It is difficult to recover unless this remaining yarn and cloth is returned for relief immediately.</p>
<h3>Workers' Cost of Living Index Increases Dramatically; Several Newspaper Offices Consider Closing Down</h3>
<p>The printing technicians of various newspaper offices in this city are currently requesting adjustments to their treatment in accordance with the workers' cost of living index. After the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Government Labor-Management Dispute Mediation Committee approved its implementation, most newspaper offices reluctantly accepted it, but they all felt deeply that they could not bear the burden. According to reports, the workers' cost of living index in this city in March has risen to more than 2,750 times. If the salaries of printing technicians must be based on this standard, most newspaper offices will not be able to cope. Therefore, several newspaper office authorities are now considering announcing a shutdown when necessary.</p>
<h3>From a Manila Concentration Camp, a Female Doctor Bitterly Narrates the Atrocities of the Japanese</h3>
<p>Hates Tomoyuki Yamashita to the Bone; the United Nations is Too Lenient Toward Japanese Criminals</p>
<p>Today, a reporter visited Ms. Gasha, a female doctor, the owner of "Yunshi Lu" at No. 6 Da Xi Road in this city. During the Japanese occupation of Manila, Gasha was trapped in a concentration camp for four years and is really one who can testify to the many who died in the battle. Among them, those who were governed by the Americans were the most numerous, so no American soldier in Manila did not know of Dr. Gasha. After the Japanese surrender, Gasha went to the United States to receive an award and only recently returned to Shanghai. It is said that during the Japanese occupation, thousands of people died in the concentration camp. Gasha once wrote to Marshal MacArthur, pointing out that the Japanese committed many evils during their banditry and submitted their list. When Mr. Yang, the former Chinese Consul General to the Philippines, was killed by the Japanese, Gasha was also present. She hates Tomoyuki Yamashita, the Tiger of Malaya, to the bone. She also said that the United Nations is too lenient to people and that many Japanese war criminals are still at large. Gasha solemnly stated that we should avenge the dead and uphold justice and should bring the Japanese to justice.</p>
<h3>Ticket Seller is Slapped; Soldiers Cause Dispute on Bus; French and Municipal Trolleybuses Stopped Service Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] At about 2 p.m. yesterday, a French-owned 18th trolleybus arrived at the terminal station of the Great World, when a group of naval soldiers suddenly came and had a dispute over taking the bus. They grabbed ticket seller No. 264 and slapped him on both sides of the face. The ticket seller, unwilling to be humiliated for no reason, immediately stopped the 17th and 18th trolleybuses. Later, due to the persuasion of the military police patrol and the labor union, the service was restored at 4:15 p.m. Unexpectedly, some naval soldiers waited near Caishi Road and Kangti Road. When the trolleybus stopped at the station, they suddenly swarmed in, causing ticket sellers No. 628 and No. 383 to be beaten and injured. After receiving the news, the patrol team went to detain the 22 naval soldiers who caused the trouble and sent them to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters by the Taishan Police Station for investigation. Representatives of the trolleybus workers also went to the garrison headquarters to demand safety guarantees. The 17th and 18th trolleybuses had not resumed service as of late evening.</p>

<h3>After a Long Period of Rain, the Weather is Clear and the Source of Supply is Gradually Increasing; Rice Prices are Gradually Falling; the Tallow Oil Market Competition is Still Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market saw the weather clear up, and people's hearts were weak. It was also heard that rice prices in the interior had fallen. As a result, both japonica and indica rice fell by 2,000 yuan. White and dark yuan also continued to fall by a small amount of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. There were sources of supply from Hexia, Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Tongli, Songjiang, Sijing, Jiaxing, Jiashan, Pinghu, Lili, and other places. The future of rice prices will not rise again for a while. The coarse grain market was closed and there was no market.</p>
<p>Due to a month of cloudy and rainy weather, the sales of tallow oil were not strong, but the source of supply has also become increasingly scarce, so the market can still be stable. Soap factories are still taking supplies one after another, but the selling price is still only slightly over 40,000 on the market scale. Therefore, sellers are not greedy, because goods without moisture from Hangzhou always cost between 44,000 and 45,000 yuan when they arrive in Shanghai. They can only be used as fuel, and this batch of sales will always be after the Qingming Festival.</p>
<h3>Limited Sales of Hardware</h3>
<p>In recent months, overseas orders have arrived one after another, and hardware merchants have been busy shipping goods, with a tendency to be overwhelmed. However, once the orders arrive, the market becomes sluggish. This is because the actual sales of factories on this street are extremely limited. Those that have not resumed operations remain the same as before, and those that have started work have already accepted a large number of dump goods. Not only do they not need to purchase, but they also have a surplus. Out-of-town merchants have not been seen buying either. Since the route for sales is not moving, the spot goods are extremely soft, with an excess supply. However, this is only the initial arrival of goods. If they continue to arrive in the future, the situation will be even more unthinkable.</p>
<h3>New Company Law Various Fees</h3>

<p>(2) When registering for the recognition of a foreign company, a registration fee of 1,000 yuan should be paid with the document, and a license fee of 500 yuan should be paid.</p>
<p>(3) If a company applies for registration due to an increase in capital, its registration fee should be paid at a rate of one in two thousand for the increased amount, and a license fee of 500 yuan should be paid.</p>
<p>(4) When a company or foreign company applies for registration to establish a branch, a license fee of 500 yuan should be paid with the document.</p>
<h3>Britain Hopes to Resolve the Sino-British Exchange Rate Problem Soon</h3>

<h3>Malaya and Myanmar Eager to Import Chinese Cotton Textiles But Strictly Prohibit the Export of Local Goods</h3>
<p>Singapore News: According to a recent announcement by the Minister of Commerce and Industry of Malaya, local importers who are allowed to allocate goods from cotton textile factories in Shanghai will be issued import permits by the authorities. However, cotton textiles shipped from China will be subject to control and may be transferred to the interior, because clothing materials in various parts of the interior are extremely scarce. Regarding the export side, it is said that he will consult with the Colonial Office to allow the export of certain goods, but major goods such as grain, tin, rubber, leather, and pepper are all on the prohibited import list. Because in January, the total value of rubber exported from Malaya to Hong Kong was 2 million yuan, which is more than the total for the entire year of 1939. As for pepper, the total value exported in the same month was also 2 million yuan, which is more than half of the total exported in the entire year of 1939.</p>

<h3>The Nation Enthusiastically Celebrated the First Youth Day After Victory Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from this city] Yesterday was the 3rd Youth Day. National flags flew all over the city, and the long-awaited clear weather added to the brilliance. The Shanghai branch of the Three Principles of the People Youth League held the city's first victory celebration at the City Gymnasium at 10:00 AM, along with the swearing-in and flag-granting ceremony for the China Air Boy Scouts. More than 30 units participated, including the Three Principles of the People Youth League, various schools, and various occupational groups. Leaders of various agencies, including Mayor Qian Dajun, Director Wu Shaoshu, Deputy Commander Li Jilan, Director Wu Kaixian, and guests Chuan Xiaofeng, Shen Chunhui, Zhan Wenhufu, Mr. Karull, representative of the Boy Scouts of America, Mr. Golden, representative of the Boy Scouts of Britain, and honored veteran Wang Changxi, totaling more than 3,000 people.</p>
<p>Chairman of the Assembly Explains the Significance</p>
<p>The assembly began with a speech by Chairman Wu Shaoshu, who stated: Today is the 3rd Youth Day, and also the first time Shanghai commemorates our own youth festival with such a grand ceremony. This is different from other specific festivals, such as "April 4th" Children's Day, "June 6th" Teachers' Day, and "March 8th" Women's Day, which all have commemorative significance to some extent. March 29th is the anniversary of the martyrdom of the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang. Thirty-five years ago today, these revolutionary youth used their heads and hot blood to shock the fatuous and corrupt Qing government, awakening the spirit of the Chinese nation and laying the foundation for the success of the Wuchang Uprising. This grand gathering of revolutionary youth is undoubtedly an indelible miracle in revolutionary history. Therefore, when our Three Principles of the People Youth League convened its first national representative assembly on March 29th, 1933, it passed a resolution to designate a day as Youth Day, and our leader, Chairman Chiang, specifically approved March 29th as that day. At this moment, our understanding of celebrating and commemorating Youth Day can be divided into three points: First, we must learn from the pure and ardent patriotism of the revolutionary martyrs of Huanghuagang, strive to complete the mission of national revival and construction, and achieve the goals of our revolutionary predecessors. Second, the country has undergone eight years of arduous struggle, and its vitality urgently needs to be restored. The economic construction of the Principle of People's Livelihood urgently needs to be developed. Our youth should display the spirit of national construction, bury our heads and work hard, strive to create, enable the country's economic construction to catch up, and move towards the path of modern culture. Third, the only task of our revolutionary youth is to remove all obstacles to national construction and realize the democratic politics of the Principle of People's Rights. Therefore, we must unite, and under the leadership of the Youth League, unite and struggle in order to complete the revolutionary mission of our democratic politics and achieve the goal of the third great union of revolutionary youth.</p>
<p>The Mayor Delivers a Speech Encouraging Youth</p>
<p>Mayor Qian then delivered a speech, stating: Today is the anniversary of the revolutionary martyrs. The central government chose today as Youth Day because most of the martyrs of Huanghuagang who sacrificed themselves for the revolution were youth in their twenties and thirties. Their pure and ardent patriotism can be emulated by today's youth, so this regulation was made. How can we emulate the revolutionary martyrs to complete the great cause of national construction? I believe that first, we must have lofty ideals. The era in which our youth find themselves today is an unprecedented era in five thousand years. The responsibilities that our youth should bear are also unprecedentedly great. The broad road before us is to build a modern country based on the Three Principles of the People. Whether in social construction, political construction, economic construction, ethical construction, or even psychological construction, we need our youth to serve as the backbone and key personnel. Therefore, our youth must have "the ambition to take the world as their own responsibility" and use the spirit of creation and enterprise to complete the mission of revolutionary national construction. After Mayor Qian's speech, Zhan Wenhufu, Li Jilan, and others spoke successively. The chairman then introduced honorary soldier Wang Changxi to the audience, and the entire venue erupted in applause. Then, the swearing-in and establishment ceremony of the first regiment of the China Boy Scouts Shanghai Branch directly affiliated Air Boy Scouts was held, with Qian Dajun administering the oath, and Wu Shaoshu, Cao Jun, Ye Chunnian, Ying Shiwem and Fan Xiaozheng swearing. The ceremony was solemn and grand. After the assembly, the Sports Association held the Youth Day City Youth Cross-Country Race awards ceremony, receiving many banners and prizes, which were awarded by Mayor Qian. A total of ten winners were awarded.</p>
<p>Various Activities of Youth Organizations</p>
<p>There were many activities by youth organizations in the city yesterday for Youth Day. A brief record is as follows: (1) The citywide youth cross-country race was organized by the Sports Association (see sports news for details).

The lack of textbooks has hindered education and technical training in China. During the war, due to a lack of transportation, these textbooks could not be shipped to China. However, the United Kingdom China Relief Fund is now able to arrange tonnage to transport the books to China and distribute them to industrial cooperatives, the Chongqing Women's Guidance Committee, and other relevant organizations. The textbooks requested to be shipped to China include textbooks on cotton spinning, wool spinning, hydraulics, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, leather manufacturing, metallurgy, and industrial chemistry. At the same time, the Chinese Women's Association is also taking steps to ship textbooks needed for wartime relief, such as books on social problems, reports on British social and health practices, career information, hospital relief work, and related subjects.</p>
<h3>Statistics on Schools in This City</h3>
<p>The Number of City Schools Increases to More Than 220 Units</p>
<p>[Central News Agency] The Shanghai Education Bureau began receiving municipal schools last September. Initially, only more than 20 schools were received, with 9,800 students and 450 teachers and staff. As of February of this year, the number of municipal schools has increased to more than 220 units, with more than 64,000 students and more than 2,400 teachers and staff. As for private schools, under the guidance of the Education Bureau after the victory, they have also been increasing day by day. There are now more than 1,000 schools, with more than 202,000 students and approximately 17,000 teachers and staff.</p>
<h3>Elementary School Teachers in Hangzhou Demand Higher Salaries</h3>
<p>A Concrete Solution Has Been Obtained Starting in March</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Hangzhou] All elementary school teachers in Hangzhou, due to the soaring prices of all goods and the difficulty of life, with an average monthly salary of only 20,000 yuan per person, which is actually less than the income of ordinary laborers, yesterday sent representatives from various schools to the Hangzhou City Education Association in Chenghuangshan City to discuss methods to request a salary increase. After discussion, they decided to request three points, which are recorded as follows: (1) Request the same treatment as provincial civil servants (i.e., 60,000 yuan, 200%). (2) Request to be allocated public grain from the Field Grain Office. (3) Request to join the Provincial Employee Consumer Cooperative to have the right to purchase cheaper allocated goods. After the teachers' representatives meeting, they submitted a request to the Municipal Education Bureau, and Mayor Zhou and Director Hammer respectively met with them and answered that, starting in March, salaries will be issued according to the salary scale standards for provincial civil servants. As for public grain and rice, it has been agreed with the Provincial Field Grain Office to allocate one stone per person per month. 3,000 stones of public grain for the first semester of the 34th year will be distributed equally among municipal government employees, and the municipal government has allocated funds to organize an education cooperative for the benefit of teachers and staff.

<h3>Celebrating the Third Youth Day – Grand and Enthusiastic Sports Performances – Lou Wenao Wins the Cross-Country Race Championship</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the Third Youth Day. In addition to the lively celebrations, the Shanghai Branch of the Youth League held various sports competitions and performances. The weather was clear and the spring breeze was warm. The City Gymnasium was crowded with people from morning to night, reaching an unprecedented scale.</p>
<p>Cross-Country Race</p>
<p>A total of 67 athletes participated in the race, and 61 arrived yesterday, with 6 absentees. At 8:00 AM, the race started from the Youth League branch on Jin Shenfu Road, turned onto Daxing Road and then Yongjia Road. Lou Wenao took the lead, followed by Liu Guangfa, Zhou Ruquan, and Ma Riji. By the time they reached Aitan Road, the rankings had changed very little, except that Zhou Ruquan gradually fell behind. Finally, they entered Shaanxi South Road from Beidang Road and Daxing Road. The mute Lou Wenao finally arrived, reaching the finish line first, taking 34 minutes and 40 seconds. The result was not particularly good, as there were puddles of water along the way, which inevitably had an impact. The top ten winners and the results of the top three are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Lou Wenao, 34 minutes and 40 seconds, (2) Liu Guangfa, 36 minutes and 26 seconds, (3) Ma Riji, 37 minutes and 55 seconds, (4) Liu Dehong, (5) Liu Zhipeng, (6) Wan Jinsheng, (7) Wang Ji, (8) Shu Zhenyao, (9) Xu Peishun, (10) Wang Jinfu.</p>
<p>Various Performances</p>
<p>The various sports performances began at 2:00 PM in the afternoon. First, the women's youth exercises were neat and lovely, followed by tap dancing, human pyramids, etc., which were all excellent and all performed by young women, making them even more touching and impressive.</p>
<p>Women's Volleyball and Basketball</p>
<p>After the performances, there was women's volleyball. The winter camp team lost to the women's youth B team with a score of 0 to 1. Next was a mixed team against the women's youth A team. The women's youth A team had veteran players such as Zhang Biru and Cheng Hongsheng, and also invited good players such as Li Po, making their momentum quite strong. The mixed team only had eight people to fight, but they fought with few against many. Wang Weizhen and Huang Mingyuan still showed their prowess, taking the lead with a score of 2 to 0, which was truly not easy. Finally, in women's basketball, the 27th team defeated the Jiu V team.</p>
<p>Health Checkup</p>
<p>The health checkup began at 10:00 AM. Yesterday was for the senior high school men's group. Today, starting at 9:00 AM, is for the senior high school men's group, and starting at 2:00 PM in the afternoon is for the Xuanzi senior and junior high schools.</p>

<h3>Lofty Ambitions Reaching for the Clouds: Air Scouts Guiding Youth Skyward</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Xingwu</p>
<p>Science has expanded the realm of humanity from land and sea to the sky. The vast expanse of space will undoubtedly become our paradise. In World War I, people discovered the importance of the sky and began to utilize it. In World War II, the air force became the main force determining victory. Of course, airplanes were not invented solely for killing. Therefore, you should not imagine Air Scouts as a "small team" solely for aerial combat. Their purpose is: "To guide youth toward the sky."</p>
<p>Due to the introduction through war, Air Scouts first appeared in the United States. In our country, they officially began just yesterday with the first troop of Air Scouts. Their predecessor was the Sino-American Scout Friendship Association. The troop has a total of thirty-three members. Because one person is ill, only thirty-two people participated in the swearing-in and flag-granting ceremony in the gymnasium yesterday. Their second platoon has eleven members, all female students from McTyeire School. The rest are students from schools such as Shanghai University, Datong, St. John's, and Shanghai College. There are also two who are already working in the business world. Each of them has certain duties and cannot be trained all day long, so they only gather once a week. In addition to the three levels of Boy Scout courses, they also emphasize aviation knowledge, such as flight, gliding, and radio.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that our country's air force is still in its infancy and needs to be strengthened in the future. I believe that because of the rapid growth of Air Scouts, the quality of the air force will also greatly improve. At the same time, I hope that the Air Scouts will expand from thirty-three people to thirty thousand, three hundred thousand, or even three million, so that the paradise in the sky of Greater China can be managed and defended by ourselves.</p>

<h3>On the Canal Road</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Tao Dian from Zhenjiang, the 25th</p>
<p>The "canal road" I am referring to is not the entire canal from beginning to end, but only a section from Yangzhou to Quanwan Post Office. This section of the canal is one hundred and six li according to Dongli, a small steamboat can make a round trip in a day without rushing. If a car is used, it only takes about five hours to make a round trip. Ordinary boats are at least half a day. It can only complete one-way task, and it also depends on whether the wind is favorable. Now, due to the boundaries of the New Nationalists and Communists, cars are out of the question, and even small steam launches have disappeared. The only means of transportation are postal express boats and some small boats the size of lotus leaves to maintain the transportation of the one hundred and six li section.</p>
<p>A Line of Long Embankment Protecting the Counties Downriver</p>
<p>We should not underestimate this line of long embankment of the canal. It bears the lives and property of the entire Lixiahe area of northern Jiangsu. If it were to collapse, not only would the agricultural products of the counties downriver be wiped out, but humans and animals would also suffer. The breach in the canal embankment in the twentieth year of the Republic of China is the most obvious example. I once went to Xinghua with the China International Famine Relief Commission. The tragic scene of that flood is still vivid in my memory. Only the backyard of the county government and the Confucius Temple had a clean spot of land. The rest was all water. The lowest streets could only see the rooftops. Therefore, when the canal water rises, the people of Xinghua rush to Gaoyou to protect the dam, while the people of Gaoyou, because they do not open the dam, cannot discharge the floodwaters, and if an accident occurs, they will bear the brunt. In order to both open and protect, the officials in charge of the canal are often caught in the middle, finding it difficult to please both sides.</p>
<p>Dredging Equipment Long Gone</p>
<p>During the late Qing dynasty, the canal was highly valued. There was a special fund every year to carry out repairs on time, and a high-ranking official was stationed to be responsible for the work, with clear levels of awards. In peacetime, they were well taken care of. Even a small canal worker was called "Master Canal Worker." However, once a danger occurred, the so-called high-ranking officials always resigned and jumped into the river to apologize to the people. Even in the early Republic of China, important officials were appointed to take charge of the work. In addition to spring repairs and summer defenses, there were also some dredging tools, such as dredgers, traveling along the canal, engaging in dredging work, fearing that the riverbed would be silted up with mud, the river channel would be narrowed, and the capacity would be reduced. But now, not only is there no spring repair or summer defense to speak of, but even those tools are nowhere to be found. Therefore, the current canal is full of dangers, especially in the Gaoyou area. And the most collapses in the canal have historically occurred in Gaoyou, which is due to the presence of Gaoyou Lake. When the water is low, there is no problem at all, but if a year of heavy flooding comes, the degree of danger is unimaginable.</p>
<p>Embankment Body Repeatedly Damaged in Recent Years</p>
<p>In the early days of the War of Resistance, fearing that the Japanese army would invade Gaoyou from the canal embankment, the section of the river embankment from Shaobo to Huaiyin was broken section by section, dug into ditches. After the fall, during the period of the puppet regime, no one cared about it. Now, it is even more scarred and dilapidated. Moreover, some people have predicted that there may be floods this year. People in Jiangsu Province are planning to discuss a solution with the Relief Administration to make preparations for spring repairs. However, this long line is completely under the control of the Communist army, so they invited members of parliament Leng Yuqiu, and others to inspect the canal area to begin work. As a result, it is said that they returned without any results. With this trend, they can only let it run its course. However, the people of northern Jiangsu have been exhausted during these eight years of the War of Resistance. If they unfortunately encounter floods again, will Heaven not be trying to destroy the people of northern Jiangsu?</p>
<p>Shaobo Town Becomes a Three-Way Free Zone</p>
<p>This is a famous town on the canal line. Now, except for Yangzhou, which is in the Nationalist army's area, the rest are under the control of the Communist army. Shaobo is a more special town. Although it is nominally under the Communist army, the area south of Shaobo is again under the Nationalist army. The people in this town are quite convenient, especially in terms of money. Anti-Japanese currency, legal tender, customs gold units, and even puppet currency are not subject to major restrictions, and profits can even be made from them. People going to the south of the Yangtze River have to exchange anti-Japanese currency for legal tender in Shaobo. Otherwise, it is not only worthless, but may even be a crime. People who enter the northern areas that have been penetrated and investigated are required to exchange "Wei" currency through the police in order to be considered "Jian" [frugal]. If they do not exchange it, once it is discovered, it will either be confiscated in full or torn up. The exchange rate, in addition to the regulations, is subject to some unstandardized ups and downs. Some people have estimated that if 10,000 legal tender is exchanged back and forth five times, it can be turned into nothing.</p>
<p>The Chu-Han Border Makes Things Difficult for the Common People</p>
<p>Three or five li away from Yangzhou, there are traces of the Communist army. The most obvious thing can be seen from the slogans. And on the road this time, a driver slowly said to me, "Sir, this is the area of the New Fourth Army."</p>
<p>I listened and looked around. The earth was very quiet, and I couldn't see any traces. I didn't believe that the terrain was divided so clearly. After a while, he slowly said to me again, "Sir, this is the area of the Nationalist army." The reporter also looked around. The earth was very quiet, and I couldn't find any traces. I only have one thought: whether it is the area of the New Fourth Army or the area of the Nationalist army, it is still Chinese land. Why do Chinese people have to divide it like this Chu-Han border? Because of this Chu-Han border, it has made the common people suffer extremely. Chinese people walking on Chinese roads have to be careful when walking and careful when speaking. A little carelessness is fraught with danger. What crime have the common people committed?</p>
<p>Two Appeals: Hope for an Early Resolution</p>
<p>In the declaration of the Second Plenary Session, regarding the restoration of transportation, it was specifically pointed out that "If transportation cannot be restored, the people cannot travel freely, goods cannot circulate smoothly, and everything else cannot be discussed." This is indeed a most serious problem. Therefore, regarding this point, we hope that both the Nationalists and the Communists will prioritize the livelihood of the people and no longer drive the common people to a dead end. Second, there is the problem of currency. The influence of puppet currency during the eight years of the War of Resistance has already exhausted the people. Now that we have won victory, the people should be allowed to catch their breath, and there should be no more obstacles between anti-Japanese currency and legal tender. Economic freeze has occurred. The difficulty of anti-Japanese currency is even greater than that of puppet currency because it cannot circulate in all directions. Since both the Nationalists and the Communists seem to prioritize the people, they should resolve these two pains as soon as possible and make an appropriate solution. This is truly serving the people.</p>

<h3>Ancestor of the Atom</h3>
<p>— Translated by Our Editorial Department</p>
<p>The theory of the atom did not begin today; it was discovered more than two thousand years ago by the ancient Greek thinker Democritus, known as the "Laughing Philosopher." He had already determined that the secrets of the universe were hidden inside the infinitely small particles. However, it was not until our time that this theory became a major scientific discovery.</p>
<p>Democritus was born in the city of Abdera in Thrace (in present-day Greece and European Turkey), near the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea. The residents of the city were known for their ignorance and stupidity. His father had secretly colluded with the Persian King Xerxes, who, to express his gratitude, sent him many exquisite gifts, including several magicians from the ancient Asian kingdom of Chaldea, that is, "sages of the East." The young Democritus studied with these sages. After his father died, he sold his inheritance and set off to travel around and study.</p>
<p>Returning Home Weary, Engaged in Lecturing</p>
<p>He visited the monks and sorcerers of Egypt, the prophets of Ethiopia, the astrologers of Persia, and the clairvoyant ascetics of India. He pondered and explored the origin of matter. He meticulously observed nature and finally developed a materialistic view that was almost the same as modern thought. After many years, he "returned home weary" to his hometown of Abdera, spending his life as a teacher and lecturer.</p>
<p>Every time he appeared in public places, he always laughed coldly and relentlessly at the stupidity of the world, thus earning the nickname "Laughing Philosopher." There were so many things to laugh at in Abdera that he refused to leave there until his death. His weather forecasts and predictions of political changes were often accurate, greatly surprising his fellow countrymen and treating him as a god. He was not only the ancestor of the atomic theory but also the creator of the calendar.</p>
<p>In the Naples Museum in Italy, there is a plaster bust of Democritus - full of beard, with a mocking expression. This ancient philosopher became famous for ridiculing the world and joking about life. However, the modern world suddenly discovered that the atom he first discovered was no longer a laughing matter.</p>
<p>Infinite Possibilities for Development</p>
<p>The use of atomic energy is still in its infancy, and its future development possibilities are unlimited. Einstein once explained that matter is merely condensed energy and that one type of matter can theoretically be changed into another. From his simple equation, it is calculated that if the atoms contained in one pound of soil were destroyed, it could produce one million horsepower for ten thousand hours, enough to supply New York's electricity needs for a year.</p>
<p>It will probably take many years before engineers can figure out how to replace coal or oil with U-235. If that level of industrialization can be achieved, power plants will certainly be very different from what they are now. At that time, steam will be generated by the heat of atomic energy.</p>
<p>We imagine a piece of uranium the size of a walnut containing the potential energy equivalent to 1,250 pounds of high-quality coal. If it can be utilized, it is truly an incredible miracle.</p>
<h3>Sketch of Ambassador Wellington Koo</h3>
<p>Ambassador Koo was nine and a half days late for the Second Plenary Session. He arrived at the meeting on the afternoon of the 10th, and was assigned seat number one. The seating chart originally had Yang Ai Yuan written on it, but it was temporarily changed to Ambassador Koo's seat.</p>
<p>That afternoon, he became the focus of attention. He was wearing a black woolen suit with thin white stripes. His already silvery white hair was parted on the right and thinly plastered on his head. His face was full but not plump. On his nose, he wore a pair of white gold glasses with black frames. He had a short, white mustache. He gave the impression of being dignified and noble, without the flashy and arrogant pretension of a typical diplomat.</p>
<p>Ambassador Koo's "lateness" was mentioned in Minister Xu Kan's report on food at the Second Plenary Session, because he was negotiating with the British side to allow the opening of Southeast Asian rice-producing areas to export food to China. Because he was "late," he did not hear the most important foreign affairs report review session at the Plenary Session. Therefore, he attended both the Political Consultative Conference and the Foreign Affairs General Assembly in the People's Political Council in the observer seats. He sat between Secretary-General Wu Tiegcheng and Vice Minister Zhu Jingnong. Mr. Wu constantly spoke with him in low voices in English. The Political Consultative Conference was a new event in domestic politics after the victory, and Ambassador Koo paid close attention to it. During the afternoon's foreign affairs report and inquiry, many speakers directed their remarks to Ambassador Koo, because everyone mentioned the United Nations General Assembly! Mentioned diplomatic style, etc., are closely related to Ambassador Koo.</p>
<p>From the perspective of a news reporter, he is a news figure that should not be missed. However, in the Second Plenary Session and the People's Political Council, because time was short, there was no opportunity to have a long conversation with Ambassador Koo. On the day of the Political Consultative Conference report in the People's Political Council, using the ten-minute break, I only made a short conversation. The reporter asked him how long he planned to stay in the country this time? Whether to go elsewhere? He said he planned to stay for a month and planned to visit the Pingjin area, but did not talk about the main issue. Chairman Wu Yifang on the stage had already announced from the amplifier "Continue the meeting." The reporter asked Ambassador Koo to sign his name as a souvenir for the newspaper and hastily ended the interview.</p>
<p>Ambassador Koo is a highly respected diplomat internationally, and the impression he gives is also approachable, without the arrogant and pretentious attitude of ordinary diplomatic personnel.</p>

<h3>Closing Remarks</h3>
<p>— Yuan Shu</p>
<p>The exhibition has closed, and as we look back on the achievements of the past few days, we feel endless gratitude.</p>
<p>First of all, we should thank the nearly one hundred thousand visitors. For the sake of cherishing the current meager gains of Chinese industry, and for the desire to seek new scientific knowledge, they eagerly came to visit. We deeply apologize that we could not avoid subjecting them to many restrictions due to our painstaking efforts to maintain order. We are also deeply grateful that they are willing to donate to our technical education assistance fund in order to enrich the content of Chinese technical education, so that our Chinese technical vocational night school has no worries about expenses.</p>
<p>Secondly, we must thank the cooperation of the manufacturers. Each factory has spent a lot of money on preparing and arranging the exhibits, and agreed with our purpose, willing to strengthen the educational significance in the content of the exhibition, and pay special attention to explaining the production process and principles, so that the audience can easily understand, and adapt to the needs of the current stage of industrialization, which is also something we can all celebrate.</p>
<p>The goodwill of the media is also worth mentioning. Every newspaper and every reporter has given the greatest tolerance to our shortcomings, and the greatest hope to any small achievement. This is entirely for China, for Chinese industry, and because Chinese industry needs encouragement and cultivation. This kind of media enthusiasm is something that we technicians and everyone who is determined to develop the national industry feel excited about.</p>
<p>We would also like to thank every staff member during the exhibition, including the representatives sent by various manufacturers to serve at the exhibition. The members of the Technical Association are of course the organizers and those responsible for the preparation of the exhibition. Many friends who are not members were invited to assist and purely volunteered to take on various specialized tasks. I believe this is also because they have a passion for promoting industrial construction. We especially regret that we did not receive the manufacturers well enough, who tirelessly and spared no effort to take care of the exhibition and explain it to the audience.</p>
<p>However, everyone can be pleased that a new and promising vision of industry has been unfolded before the people of the whole country through the opportunity of the Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition. We believe in each other that as long as we do not feel difficulty, we can continue to hold industrial product exhibitions year after year, then this vision will surely be brought closer day by day.</p>
<p>Goodbye, to every gentleman and lady who cares about and is responsible for China's new industry. The road is not difficult to walk, but it must be taken step by step.</p>
<h3>Technical Personnel and Technical Construction</h3>
<p>— Fang Ai</p>
<p>There are two directions for promoting technical education. On the one hand, it is to promote technical education universally, so that every citizen pays attention to industrial issues and creates a social atmosphere of learning engineering, gaining the minimum level of industrial knowledge. On the other hand, it is to deeply cultivate a group of hard-working and pragmatic technical personnel who are consciously willing to work hard for the construction of a new China. The result of creating a social atmosphere of learning engineering is that it can encourage many young people to embark on the road of hard work and pragmatism. The purpose of the Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition hosted by the Chinese Technical Association is to create this social atmosphere. The industrial lectures and technical night schools held in the past were to cultivate a group of technical personnel for industrial nation-building.</p>
<p>The content of the Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition may seem too dry to some audiences who are not familiar with engineering issues, and it must seem ordinary to some audiences who are specializing in engineering research. However, it is undeniable that if you can spend an hour or two carefully listening to the explanations of each exhibition department, they will tell you how much painstaking history of improvement and research. Technical personnel, in the eyes of people who do not engage in engineering, are craftsmen, and in the eyes of some academic experts, are narrow-minded. However, they do not know that our daily lives cannot but rely on the efforts of these pragmatic technical personnel. Every industrial product has been constantly improved by them, so that people's enjoyment has reached its current state. Everyone knows the principles of the atomic bomb, and what is being debated is only a technical issue.</p>
<p>The improvement of technology is not a difficult task. The question is whether we have this spirit of hard work, and whether the strong members of society attach importance to this issue. The former is what the Chinese Technical Association needs to work harder on, and the latter is what we hope all sectors of society will assist in.</p>
<p>The past and future of this association has been clearly presented to all sectors through this exhibition. We hope that the gentlemen who love this association will give us corrections and assistance.</p>
<h3>Our Voice</h3>
<p>— Shi Yue</p>
<p>The Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition has been open for six days, and the crowds are the largest seen in the past eight years, which is truly unexpected. In this way, China's industrialization is not without hope.</p>
<p>We ask ourselves that we are a late-rising group, so we humbly seek criticism anytime and anywhere, but the only regret is that we only hear words of praise, which reduces our opportunities to correct our mistakes.</p>
<p>Here it is! I happened to hear two negative criticisms in a private conversation: One said: "This kind of exhibition would have been more meaningful if it had been held fifty years ago." I said to him: "We are precisely because China's industry has been devastated by the enemy and puppets, and then suffered setbacks after victory. In a situation of regression, it is not as prosperous as it was fifty years ago. Therefore, we want to use an exhibition like the one fifty years ago to revive the vitality of Chinese industry." Another said: "This kind of exhibition, held in a cosmopolitan commercial port open to Chinese and foreign observers, seems to be embarrassing and may be laughed at by others." "That's right," I said, "it is an undeniable fact that Chinese industry is backward, but is it a fundamental solution to avoid treatment because of fear of disease? Is this the attitude that people in the technical circle should take? Not being afraid of embarrassment and ridicule is precisely the courage of the organizers and participants of this industrial exhibition. The problem is not whether there is a problem, but whether we can catch up quickly after being laughed at. I can guarantee that 'Zhong Ji' [Chinese Technical Association] and all the manufacturers in the venue definitely have this courage. 'Knowing shame' is originally 'close to courage'!" If this naive "industrial exhibition" has done its best to promote China's industrialization and promote Chinese industry, then it has completed its mission. As for the truly practical work of "Zhong Ji", it is not just a mere exhibition, otherwise, it would be enough to show off at the exhibition, why bother to raise funds again?</p>
<p>Therefore, the "industrial exhibition" is merely our voice.</p>
<h3>"Industry Exposition" Reflections</h3>
<p>— Shi Wen</p>
<p>Now no one doubts, no one hesitates; on the contrary, replacing the past fears and gloom is excitement and interest. Many of the staff members expressed this same feeling in their "Workers' Words." Who is not inspired by this enthusiastic scene! Who is not happy for this enthusiastic scene!</p>
<p>The staff's lofty, selfless spirit was fully manifested in this exhibition. They sacrificed sleep, sacrificed their professions, or schoolwork, and some even sacrificed their health in the end. Why such enthusiasm, such dedication to working hard for the exhibition? It was not for fame, nor for profit, but a response to the motherland's call. They felt there was a need to hold an industrial exhibition as a call for national industrialization.</p>
<p>It was this feeling that connected them, as close as a family, each guarding their post. For a week, they strained their voices and stood until their legs ached, without complaint or regret, always enthusiastically accepting the day's tasks. In this instance, we once again realized the value of "harmony among people," and we firmly believe that any difficult and arduous task, as long as the group is united, can be overcome. Don't believe it? I tell you, the exhibition was indeed supported by this spirit.</p>
<p>Secondly, the holding of the exhibition has undeniably changed the entire situation. At the beginning of preparations, everyone was unfamiliar with the China Technical Association, and even many who cared about us were worried about this time. Thanks to the manufacturers, academic circles, industrial circles, the press, and the student community, the exhibition was able to close successfully today. However, the responsibility of the Technical Association has increased as a result. Because it has transformed from a liaison organization into a national organization. In other words, its status has been elevated in this event.</p>
<p>Holding an industrial product exhibition is just an attempt today, so many aspects seem insufficiently substantial. However, we feel that if we want to improve the academic content today, it is not suitable for a single level of expertise. Only the mix of commodities and industry attracts a large audience. We hope that in the future, according to the national construction process, we can gradually increase the content and broaden the scope.</p>
<h3>Culture and Industry</h3>
<p>— Ning Fu</p>
<p>To promote culture, I feel that improving the cultural level is inseparable from industrial progress. If you only have the mind of a cultural person, or engage in other artistic fields, but lack the necessary tools, what can you rely on to develop and carry it forward?</p>
<p>Examples are easy to find. For example, to write an article, you need a smooth-flowing pen. Where does that pen come from? When your academic thoughts are written down, you need "Alarm Bell" brand paper and copperplate to print and distribute them to people to read and learn. But old duplicators are too clumsy, so you have to switch to the "Daming" mimeograph machine, which is very fast and clear, so that your work can be widely disseminated. Or, if it is a book, to preserve the plates when reprinting, you also need "Great Light Industry Factory" produced "Brand" proof paper to make paper plates for permanent use.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you are a cultural person, you still have to rely on industry; advanced industry to help your work, in order to complete your mission of promoting culture with half the effort and twice the result.</p>
<h3>Worker's Words</h3>
<p>Outside, it is raining heavily, and in some places the roads are flooded by inches, but the guests attending have not decreased because of this. They are so attentively observing the manufacturing process, the machinery, the applications, and everything on display. This shows that there is no force that can stop people's love of truth and desire for knowledge. As a worker, he feels that the past efforts have not been without reward. At the same time, he believes that as long as it is for the progress and happiness of mankind, all efforts will be rewarded accordingly. For the more difficult work in the future, we have indeed gained no small encouragement and more courage here. —Wang Minxi</p>
<p>"We hope that the content of the exhibition is academic and has educational significance, so that the audience can gain industrial knowledge and arouse public attention to industry." These were the words used in the association's business department's circular to manufacturers soliciting participation.</p>
<p>"If the factory's layout focuses too much on advertising, it will lose the meaning of the exhibition. Looking at the registration form is really worrying. Most of them are only writing about the exhibits. If it becomes a department store, it will be terrible." All of our staff members were worried about this.</p>
<p>"We will mobilize public friends to contact familiar manufacturers, persuade and help them design."</p>
<p>"Our association will also mobilize members to design electrical knowledge and mechanical knowledge to enrich the content of the exhibition." This was our meeting resolution.</p>
<p>Although our attitude towards work has remained the same from the beginning of preparations to the closing of the exhibition, since the staff members do not have rich experience in organizing exhibitions, they have been extremely cautious in handling the preparatory work. Finally, on March 24th, the opening date arrived, and seeing that most of the exhibition results provided by the manufacturers were accompanied by descriptions of the production process, charts, and cross-sections of the machine's physical objects, the mood of our staff gradually relaxed at this time. We deeply admire the cooperation between the factory and our association. This is also the first cooperation between the industrial circles and technical personnel. We hope that it is also a symbol of permanent cooperation. —Wu Zhongyi</p>
<p>Mr. Yao Yuyi, a famous industrialist, visited us yesterday at the invitation of our association. He gave deep encouragement to the work done by the Technical Association and generously donated a large sum of money for the expenses of the Technical Association. Mr. Yao also promised to help with the issue of the location of the Technical Association's clubhouse and night school, which the Technical Association currently feels is difficult. This gift to technical personnel and China's technological construction, benefiting society, is something that all members of the "Technical Association" should be grateful for.</p>
<p>The members of the China Technical Association include departments such as chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, textile engineering, mining and metallurgy, agriculture, commerce, mathematics, and physics, and are divided into full members, basic members, junior members, and supporting members. Scientists, engineers, technicians of all levels, and technical college students are warmly welcomed to join as members. The constitution and past history are explained in detail in the special publication of the Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition. For individual requests for the constitution, applications for membership, or other matters, please send a letter to the China Technical Association, c/o China Science Society, 533 South Shaanxi Road, Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Declaration of the Establishment of the China Technical Association</h3>
<p>The China Technical Association was established through the reorganization of the Soviet Friendship Association, and its history has been one year and six months. The past undertakings of this organization, such as industrial (lectures, engineering magazines, China Technical College Night School), have already gained social attention. Since the opening of the Shanghai Industrial Products Exhibition, it has aroused the concern of the Chinese people. The founding declaration of the association is attached below, and it is hoped that friends of the Technical Association will generously provide guidance.</p>
<p>The China Technical Association was officially established in Shanghai on March 17, 1946. We would like to take this opportunity to express our thoughts and wishes to the people of the country.</p>
<p>"Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world." Everyone has a due obligation to the country. Moreover, "the world belongs to everyone," the country is owned by the people, and everyone has the right to be respected. China has suffered from war for a long time. Looking at our rivers and mountains, what we see and hear is devastation everywhere and the suffering of the people. Every conscientious and passionate Chinese person cannot help but be moved and feel the heavy burden on their shoulders. The members of this association are all technical personnel. In China, where there are many illiterates and the people are weak, we are very fortunate to have received the baptism of new education and new science. Each of us has a unique skill. At this time of recovery and reconstruction, we consider the needs of the country and the demands of the people, and dare not underestimate ourselves. We deeply realize that we should use new technologies to serve the new China and build the new China. This is our unshirkable responsibility.</p>
<p>Therefore, we have organized ourselves. We have raised the banner of the China Technical Association to call on, encourage, and gather technical personnel from all over the country to participate in this once-in-a-lifetime undertaking of national construction for our beloved motherland. The work of national construction has countless aspects, and the directions we should strive for are to promote construction on the one hand and to cultivate talents on the other. In order to promote construction, we want every technical person to join the flood of national construction, each contributing his skills to promote the construction work in various departments. We advocate cultivating talents, hoping that the country can have a constant stream of technical young army to inherit and carry forward the established construction foundations. Only through continuous training, continuous mobilization, consistent participation, and consistent efforts, without wasting a minute or a second of time, and without wasting a drop of blood or sweat of manpower, can our national construction work be completed as soon as possible, and then our compatriots who are closely related can be freed from suffering as soon as possible and achieve well-being.</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot ignore reality. Half a year has passed since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, and we deeply doubt whether we have reaped the fruits of victory. In fact, we are heartbroken by the downfall of national industry, indignant at the gathering of bureaucratic capital, and anxious about the slow recovery, the farmers' inability to return to their fields, and the workers being excluded from factory gates. We also sigh at the vagueness of the economic construction plan, but it is useless to be heartbroken, indignant, anxious, and sighing. If you don't break through the clouds, you can't see the moonlight; if you don't remove the thorns, you can't pave a smooth road. Everyone is the master of China, and revitalizing China is an obligation and a right. For the sake of the country and the people, we should do our best to eliminate unreasonable phenomena and put the locomotive of national construction on track. We want to assist kind national industrialists in rebuilding their businesses, and we want to urge and support the legitimate and sound use of state capital. We are also concerned about the return of farmers to their homes, the return of workers to factories, the smooth flow of transportation, the decline in prices, and the realization of a huge and solid national economic construction plan.</p>
<p>If the current obstacles cannot be overcome, then we cannot participate in or promote construction, and the cultivation of talents will be in vain.</p>
<p>Today, we technical personnel clearly recognize that participating in the construction of a new China is not a career, but a hope, a truth. We must hold the spirit of martyrs and dedicate our knowledge, skills, and strength to realize a prosperous and happy new China. We should always think for the best and imitate the best, but we should not ignore difficulties and obstacles. We are all technical personnel, we all have patriotic loyalty, and we all have ideals to present to the good. In order to carry out our loyalty and realize our ideals, we believe that it is meaningful to come together. From now on, we will focus on service externally and focus on unity internally. We want to become a sound and pure group of technical personnel, friendly and harmonious, helping and encouraging each other, cultivating sincere friendship, seeking each other's welfare, and building a common cause.</p>
<p>During difficult times, Chinese technical personnel have shown excellent results, and we believe that future national construction work will definitely be smooth, and the contribution of technical personnel will definitely be even more impressive. However, technical personnel are only one part of national construction, so we also need assistance and cooperation from all aspects. We sincerely ask for the enthusiastic support and love from all levels of society across the country.</p>
<p>The new China needs new technical personnel. The new technical personnel must be selfless, non-blindly follow, non-complacent, and non-speculative; they must have ideals, breadth of mind, perseverance, and integrity. The China Technical Association will promote this style from now on. Only in this style can the power of national construction be maximized and the great cause of national construction be completed as soon as possible. However, we will never exaggerate, we only firmly believe that: if you have a point of maturity, give off a point of light, and the more fuel, the stronger the power. Therefore, on this warm and clear day, we dare to appeal to the people of the country: for the sake of China and for the sake of our compatriots, please extend your hands of sympathy and mutual assistance!</p>
<p>On the occasion of the establishment, this declaration is made.</p>
