<h3>軍調部政府代表　向共方提備忘錄　抗議安平證人爭執問題</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿七日電〕因調處無效，戰爭日趨擴大，軍調部已完全失掉互忍互諒精神，而一變爲表面化之互相攻擊。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿七日電〕安平事件調查工作，刻仍停頓中·執行部美方副委員戴伯爾門與廿五小組代表馬丁上校，昨曾與葉劍英交換意見，決定暫將前次在安平調查時所發生之枝節問題留　，立刻恢復調查工作。廿七日晨九時馬丁即召集政府，共黨兩方代表開會，席問，政府代表張叔衡稱：前次在安平調查時，中共黃代表一則申明安平鎮軍事政治情形皆已改變，所有證人，證物，證言皆不足爲憑，再則言當日如不在安平詢問完竣，則該地證人即有改變供詞之機會，並懷疑政府不能爲安平　證人負責，黃代表此種觀念如不改變，則殊無再度出發安平調查之必要。至此，張氏詢問黃逸峯已吾改變上述觀念，黃逸峯無答覆，遂以主席　格宣布休會。據悉，政府方面爲廿五小組在安平發生證人爭執之共黨代表調查態度問題，已繼美方之後致共方備忘錄一件，提出抗議，大致政府方面將俟共方予以滿意答覆後，再行復會。至安平鄉民會王亭所供共軍曾俘美軍二人事，美方　保持械默，廿七日共產黨新華社稿亦提及有關於此事供詞，但朱加任何批評，　相如何，殊費揣測。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿七日電〕軍調部中共發言人，廿七日發表書面談話，略稱：「八月一日北平世界日報戰稱，近某方人員潛入北平，進行槍劫，暗殺，間諜活動，八月十日執行部政府參謀長蔡文治，即以此爲根據，向執行部美方提出備忘錄稱：本人（蔡氏）獲悉一切執行小組之共產黨組員，於執行其和平工作職務外，均曾進行間諜活動。繼稱：本人以爲，凡執行小組之共方人員，被發現爲間諜時，彼即喪失其執行小組組員之特權，應取法律制裁。八月十一日再以備忘錄送美方，以上述之世界日報新聞爲根據，證明「共產黨已派其人員來平，在平製造混亂」，聲明「政府當局已竭盡努力，維持北平之地方治安與社會秩序」。八月廿三日新民報載平市公安局長湯永咸談話稱：平市匪患原因之一，爲茶方有暗殺搶劫之組織，並有特種身份掩護。廿四日新生報公然載稱，共軍指使匪徒，破壞平市治安，而此匪徒係受執行部某要員所領導，該發言人認爲，此乃「有組織有計劃的陰謀」指此爲「企圖陷害逮捕共產黨人員和破環執行部的存在」。繼稱：共產黨方面已在南京，北平兩地向國民黨當局提出警吿。謂：「共產黨人員應國美雙方之請，依三方協議，來到政府區域，担負調處任務，故除已要求撤查蔡文治，湯永咸外，如果在政府地區發生對共產黨人員危害失蹤或其他侵害時，共產黨方面將不能忍受」</p>

<h3>美陸次重要聲明　出售剩餘物資絕無軍火　談判民航協定與此無關</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處本市訊〕美陸次裴特森及美國國務卿與國外濟理專員特別幫辯麥　布今日經由上海美總領事署發表聲明，內容如次：</p>
<p>我人發現報紙載稱：我人正與中國政府「秘密」商談，以大量剩餘軍火，武器及其他純粹軍用品售與中國，並謂爲促使美國考慮出售是項物資，中國須以有價値之民航權利讓與美國，此種報吿，絕無根據。</p>
<p>目前止在談判者，乃以若干剩餘物資售與中國，是項物資現藏於西太平洋，其原來價債爲五萬萬美元。</p>
<p>在行將售與中國之物資內，絕無軍火，武器，飛機或任何其他純粹軍用品，所有此種剩餘物資，均係民用式或純係民間使用之物品，我等認爲中國購買是項物資，必可有利於中國之復興及其和平時期之經濟。</p>
<p>在出售剩餘物資之談判中，朱曾亦不致涉及中國民用航空權問題，至於有關民航協定之談判正由國務院代表鮑威爾進行中，飽氏雖係我人同機來華之人物，但絕非剩餘物資代表團之團員，飽氏之談判與剩餘物資談判，絕無關係。</p>
<p>鮑氏稱：渠與中國政府所商談者，乃係一種互相的及雙方面之民航協定，而是項協定之性質。正與美國與世界十八個國家所簽訂者雷同，鮑氏復稱：民航協定完成後，其條款將由國務院公開發表。</p>
<p>裴特森與麥克布復稱：以剩餘物資售與中國事，若能順利完成，絕非一種秘密協定，將發表盡面聲明或召開記渚會宣布之。</p>
<h3>在華物資非法出售案　美當局即將開始調查</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿六日電〕關於美車在華剩餘物資發現非法出售一事，美國國務院對此拒不置評，僅悉，美國當局不日即開始調查，其中最大之不法行爲，殆爲未得當局准許，擅將軍械售與中國政府，其中有完整無缺之轟炸機七架。</p>
<p>〔合衆社本市訊〕據悉：美國國外剩餘物資淸理委員會上海辦事處，曾以完好可飛之美國8-25型米契爾式轟炸機十架轉讓與中央航空公司，似已直接破壞聯邦法規「除非獲有國務院或聯合參謀部特准，不得以戰鬥設備作剩餘物資出售之規定」。該項轟炸機係於數月前交與中央航空公司者，業由該公司呈由交通部移交與中國空軍。</p>
<p>當詢及米契爾式轟炸機之來源時，中央航空公司機航組吿合衆社謂，係向美物資淸委會上海辦事處所購得，其總數約一百五十架。</p>
<p>中央航空公司機航組主任陳文寬與某由國記者晤談時，曾稱：從物資淸委會購來之8-25型機中，有若干架之飛行時間尙不足七百小時。陳並解釋謂，該項飛機至少須飛三千小時方能稱舊，據稱：其中並雜有戰爭後期所造之8-25型丁種機（按即最新之一型）。</p>
<p>據負責方面强調稱：此項軍機之轉讓與中央航空公司，事先絕未經國務院或聯合參諜部之認可，彼輩雖未能代表裴特森發言，唯對中共所稱五億美元剩餘軍用物資行將售與中國一節，深表懷疑。據指出，情委會曾協議出售犬批太平津區域內容之剩餘物資，唯此事將按照他離一之規定，不涉及有用之軍　品。</p>
<p>同時，中央航空公可陳文寬主任前發表之文件，證實合衆社前所發表關於中央公司廉價購得飛機之消息。據中央航空公司職員稱：該公司根據合同所購得之一百五十架飛機中，內有8-25型十架，C-46型九十架，C-87型二架（此係解放式轟炸機改裝作運貨用者）與C-47型四十餘架·共計價款的爲五十萬美元。如此·平均每架僅合美金三十餘元，較上海一輛商用吉普車之售價超過無幾。</p>
<p>美國外物資　委會主委麥克布稱：「此種性能之可航飛機有一「通行世界之標　價格」，每架約爲二萬美元。</p>
<h3>萬全事情登陸艇　在漢失火焚燒</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口廿七日電〕行總水運大隊萬全號登陸艇，昨以工人拋擲煙頭，引起大火，延燒達數小時，幸大半貨物，早已起卸，僅肥田粉數噸被焚，又以搶救迅速，機件幸尙保全。</p>
<h3>中共駐滬辦事處　昨招待中外記者　報吿對美剩餘物資處理意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日下午三時，中共駐滬辦事處在馬斯南路一〇七號招待本市新聞界，到中外記者七十餘人，中共方面出席發言者僅陳家康一人。當由陳氏報吿對美剩餘物資處理問題之意見，渠稱對於此事，中共擬向美國政府表示嚴重抗議，要求立即停止。旋由各報記者提出問題，至四時始散會。茲誌其問答如下：</p>
<p>問：據報載軍調處執行部政府代表陳介民曾有備忘錄致中共代表葉劍英，聲明中共如進攻大同，政府軍隊即進攻延安，承德，張家口，聞華劍英已接受，此事確否？</p>
<p>答：中共對於該備忘錄之答復，此間尙未接獲報吿，惟原則上如國軍不取攻勢：共軍決不進攻，且中共文件上從未有一定要取大同之企圖。</p>
<p>問：安平事件最近中共與美方談判情形如何？</p>
<p>答：在未有正式報吿前因受調查小組的束，不便發表。</p>
<p>問：日前報戰政府與中共爭執之區域，擬委託美國暫爲管理，此息政府已予否認，中共對此作何批評。</p>
<p>答：中共絕對反對此舉，因係違反民族主義及國家獨立。</p>
<p>問：近聞延安解放日報上有文攻擊馬帥私人，中共對美調處政策是否深有反感？</p>
<p>答：（一）直至現在，中共仍歡迎馬帥調處，並希望其根據一莫斯科會議之決定而能獲成功，（二）中共始終希望美政府終止軍事援華。</p>
<p>問：張莘夫事件報上已發表兇犯係奉中共命令，中共對此解釋如何？</p>
<p>答：此事眞相尙待延安發表，報上所載恐係一面之詞。</p>
<p>問：中共在延安拘留之政治犯將如何處置？</p>
<p>答：中共從未有政治犯，現所拘留者係作戰時之俘虜，將考慮與政府交換。</p>
<p>問：勝利已一年，硫球羣島尚未歸還中國，中共意見如何？</p>
<p>答：波茨坦會議時硫球羣島並未劃歸中國。</p>
<p>問：南京報載中共方面消息，中美間尙有關於商業航空之談判詳情如何？</p>
<p>答：余所知者僅爲此間報上中央社之消息。</p>
<p>問：中共對此項航空談判意見如何？</p>
<p>答：任何有關中國主權之事，應就商於聯合政府，在聯合政府未成立以前，我們不承認任何理政府所訂有關主權之條約。</p>
<p>問：商業航空何以有關主權？</p>
<p>答：例諸過去內河航權一事，即可明瞭，且談判亦係秘密進行者，難知其內情，很可能在關主權。</p>
<p>問：中共對李聞案意見如何？民主同盟要求移京審判一節，中共意見如何？</p>
<p>答：民盟要求是對的。</p>
<p>問：聞案兇手，旣已槍決，對該案何以仍表不滿？</p>
<p>答：槍決兇手，是否係眞正兇手，李案兇手爲誰？均成疑問。</p>
<p>問：蘇北戰事近狀如何？</p>
<p>答：報戰政府軍正向邵伯進攻，可見政府在蘇北採取攻勢。</p>
<p>問：今日報載共軍擬攻泰興泰州？</p>
<p>答：詳情不知，總之中共在蘇北佔不到便宜。</p>
<p>問：聞馬歇爾提出和平談判新方案，中共態度如何？</p>
<p>答：中共的態度報上已有明載，即不拒絕先改組後停戰的建議，但有兩個條件，即（一）是否改組政府談妥後即無條件停戰？（二）是否政府放棄中共退出蘇北等五項要求。</p>
<p>問：中共對「聯合政府」意見如何？</p>
<p>答：聯合政府包括各黨派，不是中共　國民黨兩方面的意見所能代表一切。</p>
<h3>行總救濟物資　停運冀熱共區</h3>
<p>工作人員未獲保陴</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿七日電〕行總冀熱平津分署，已停止對冀執共區之救濟，蓋該署此種工作，始終在共方强制下，一切救濟物資，不能由行總人員親自發放，而還行總定章，交通運輸亦未予協力，工作人員之安全，未得保障，因此該署決暫停止對共區救濟物資之遝輸，並呈請行總與周恩來交涉，俟獲得適當答覆後，再行解禁。該分署駐承德工作員已撤回，此前該分署運往冀熱共區之救濟物資，共約二千噸。又該分署今後之工作重心，將由救濟轉途善後，如改進農業生產，協助工業復員，並擬開井萬哏，對平津日人所遺留之工業，而被國人盜賣破壞者，則不能期待行聯之協助，亦因聯總反對也。該分署並計於一年內，在冀熱每縣，設一醫院及救濟院。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京廿七日電〕山東難民救濟協會理事長丁惟汾等，今午假慈悲社十二號歡宴新由山東視察歸來之社會部長谷正綱，藉表慰勞之意。據谷氏談稱：此次視察魯災，爲時八日，在濟僅二日，殊感匆促，然所得印象甚深，實感「魯難」嚴重，亟待救濟。現在政府管轄之區域內，計有百萬以上之難民，非加賑濟不能生活，允以淄博礦區之失業工人六萬餘名待賑允殷，此外，尙有靑年學生甚多，非設法收容，使其就學不可，所有難民均係着單衣逃出，現當秋凉之際，衣着已成問題，現在行總魯靑救濟分署與山東省政府雖已設法增加救濟物資，積極賑濟，而中央亦須增加賑物與賑款，及時救濟，谷氏表示對於救濟山東難民，已擬具計劃，不日即携牯嶺謁見主席。</p>
<h3>中樞昨紀念孔誔　張繼主席講述紀念意義</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿七日電〕廿七日爲孔子誕辰，中樞晨九時在國府禮堂舉行紀念會，由張委員繼主席，並講述紀念意義稱：吾人今日紀念孔子誕辰，爲抗戰八年勝利還都後之首次，故倍覺欣慰，此次抗戰，我國人民生命與財產損失甚大，但終能獲得勝利，實爲精神力量所致，精神力量者何，即緬懷古聖先賢之　功偉業，與五千年光榮之歷史是也。張氏繼稱：語云大戰之後，必有荒年，但今歲我國各地豐收，允以川湘鄂贛等地，今年　收之現象，爲廿年來所未有，故國家前途，深可樂覜，但不幸有一部分人士，必欲毀滅自己的國家，發動內戰，而美其名曰黨爭，孔子曰：「必也正名乎。」張氏嗣歷述堯舜禹湯孔子道統之嬗演，，並强調漢武帝對於中華民族歷史之功績，繼稱我總理繼承此一道統而傳諸總裁，亦即傳諸本黨，故吾人亟宜發揮聖人之道，而不可自侮，以招致人侮，尤應本好學近乎智，力行近乎仁，知恥近乎勇之明訓，淬厲查發。張氏最後建議各地孔廟應加保存，並經常宣講孔學。報吿歷四十分鐘。（尙有滬市及各地紀念消息，請閱第六版。）</p>
<h3>浙東四明山匪患　省府限三月肅清　綏靖指揮部九月中成立</h3>

<h3>川產桐油價大漲</h3>

<h3>前第六戰區負責人　談分配物資經過　對清查團指責有所申述</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口廿七日電〕前第六戰區長官部負責人，頃就淸查團指責該部將接收物資配發官兵，作爲勝利品一節，發表談話，對當局權宜處理之實際情形，特作坦白之申述，內容首對該部先發後報之事實，承認手續上自有未妥，但聲明其中經過與外傳事實確有出入，（一）接收物資中之非軍用品，大部已分別呈繳，有案可稽，其經該部配發者，僅屬一小部份，且此小部分物資之配發，實基於當時環境上之特殊需要，例如洋燭一項，因當時武漢電燈尙未恢復，而受降事忙，各機關均須澈夜辦公，故要臨時配發，以應急需，他如脚踏車，水泥及文具，紙張等或係交通機關傳送公文及辦公之用，或係爲修理營房時所必需，均不能不臨時配發，其他如香煙，餅干，醬油等食品，則不僅不耐久，且一部份已霉爛，更不能不早爲處理，以免全部廢棄。某負責人並吿記者曰，以當時情况之急追窘困及市面之蕭條（購買不易），動用此些許接收物資，實情理所容許，而豈得謂爲過份行動乎？（二）淸查團估計前項配發之物資，總値約四十億元，係按目前市價估計，查配發物資，係上年十一月間事，近據武漢區行政院特派員辦公處佔計，該項物資價値僅爲十八億元，如以去年物價估計，再除折舊之數字，則其價値當更不到此數，况受領勝利品之機關部隊，除長官部，警備部及兵站總監部外，尙有憲十一團，通三團，工六團，十八軍及市警局，汽八團，鄂商院等四十餘大單位，共官兵總人數至少在二萬五千人以上，何只兩千餘人，以如許人數分配此小部分物資，準情酌理，亦不爲多。（三）前第六戰區軍紀素極嚴明，抗戰八年，官兵生活雖極艱苦，但均能奉公守法，自受命來漢受降，並曾誥誠所屬，嚴守紀律，對接收工作允勉以迅速確實，故卒能圓滿達成任務。最近陸軍總部所發受降紀實中，載明本戰區接收物資數量爲全國冠，事實明顯，可資參證，且所有配發情形，均於去年十一月軍政部陳部長，內政部張部長，組織部陳部長蒞漢時，當面報吿，自信極爲光明坦白。最後該負責人謂、本案已經行政院估定物資，總值爲十八億元，飭即扣價解庫，自當遵辦，惟以長官部已結束，各受領單位亦多改編歸併，人員星散，此項價欵實無法扣回，已呈請中央准予免扣，想中央俯念官兵困難，必能予以合理解决也。</p>
<h3>武漢建大鐵橋</h3>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>民選乎？極權乎？</h3>
<p>在世界第二次大戰中，僞裝術研究及使用，眞可以說發達極了；眞的形相因爲使用僞裝的結果，幾乎全被掩飾，從高空或遠處看過去幾乎無從辨識，很容易達到以假亂眞的效果。這種僞裝雖或能欺騙敵人，終究不能欺騙自己的。這正如化妝術的流行或發展，固然可以使天生麗質益增其嬌妍，但生來不是麗　而是醜的人儘管化妝美容術如何發達，終究不能掩飾她的醜惡，這是化妝美容術的悲劇。</p>
<p>同樣的情形也發見在其它的領城。例如一昨中共代表周恩來招待記者時稱：『我認爲蔣主席的這一文吿「不僅未能改變這種局勢，而且更惡化這一局勢。」「因爲他所提的停戰條件，是要中共部隊撤出許多地區，並將當地民選政府取消，由國民黨一黨政府來接收。」又謂「在一月停戰協定宣布後，政府方面始終不實行東北停戰，不接受馬歇爾將軍提議…』我們讀了道一席談話，不也有思以化妝術來掩飾醜惡這一種滑稽的感覺嗎？</p>
<p>「民選政府，」好漂亮的名稱！試問在極權主義下的所謂「解放」區域，能有民選的政府嗎？「民選」是一種現代化妝美容術，然而卻隱藏不了極權主義的痕跡，這正如粉與口紅不能掩飾醜惡一樣。即就退一步而言，假如共軍撤離而其所製造的政治制度仍復令其存在，則人民對於極權主義的恐怖依舊未能泯滅，成千成萬流亡在外的難民，何能返鄉安居，交通依舊將受梗阻，是則問題仍然未能解決。至於所云「由國民黨一黨政府來接收，」尤無須我們指斥，今日的國民政府不儘有無黨無派的人士參加嗎？</p>
<p>關於東北，我們看見他們這樣說：「…政府方面始終不實行東北停戰，不接受馬歇爾將軍提議。」這八個月來的事實，究竟誰在不接受馬歇爾將軍的提議…中國人民的知識水準維較低，是不能輕易被欺騙的。長春哈爾濱的攻占不也由於中共的發動？凡此種種是決不能以僞裝或化妝來欺騙世人的。「民選」乎？梔權乎？中國人民誰都明白。化妝之術雖精，醜惡是終究隱藏不起來的。</p>
<h3>從希阿問題看英蘇關係</h3>
<p>聯合國安全理事會今天在紐約開會，除了討論若干非會員國要求加入聯合國的問題而外，並已以烏克蘭代表曼紐斯基對希臘的控訴列入議程內，亦將提出討論，於是希臘與阿爾巴尼亞兩國的邊界衝突，也就成爲目前國際上最重要的問題了。</p>
<p>烏克蘭代表曼紐斯基於本月廿四日，突然致電聯合國大會秘書長當伊，要求安全理事會將希阿兩國的邊界衝突列入下次會議的議程內，其所根據的理由有四：（一）希臘屢次向阿爾巴尼亞挑　，以致　起邊界衝突，足以危及巴爾幹和平；（二）希臘代表在巴黎和會發表演說，使希阿兩國關係益加緊張；（三）希臘虐待境內的少數民族；（四）希臘利用宣傳，企圖重行劃分巴爾幹國界。最後曼紐斯基並譴責英軍繼續駐留希臘境內，干涉希臘的內政。由此可知烏克蘭代表的申訴，不是一個單純的問題，僅涉及希阿兩國而已；且有着極複雜微妙的國際背景，使安全理事會處理這個間題，不得不而臨極大的困難。</p>
<p>第一曼紐斯基對希臘向安全理事會控訴，顯然是蘇聯在歐集團的一種「外交反攻」。因爲自巴黎和會在盧森堡宮開幕以來，蘇聯在每次舌戰之中，輒以「寡不敵衆」，而遭受挫折，不僅蘇聯的體面喪失殆盡，而且在精神上也頗爲沮喪；因此便想在巴黎利會之外，有所發動，藉以振起蘇聯的精神。蘇聯突然照會土耳其，要求蘇土兩國進行談判，修改蒙特　公約，　更達靻尼爾海峽在法理上的地位，也是出之於這種動機；詎意土耳其的態度鎭定，不受任何威脅，英美的意見又完全一致；預料蘇聯很難獲得其所期望的結果，曼紐斯基也就在別的方面，發動外交反攻了。</p>
<p>第二今日的希臘，在巴爾幹半島上，已成爲衆矢之的；尤其是希臘現政府要求英軍仍駐留該國境內，引起蘇聯的反感，所以在巴黎和會中，希臘和蘇聯集團所屬各國，即蘇聯·白俄羅斯·烏克蘭·南斯拉夫·捷克·波蘭等國，到處站在水炭不相容的地位，一有問題提出討論，就要引起一塲無謂的舌戰。綜合起來，雙方意見衝突的焦點，也有下列三項：（一）希臘不願阿爾巴尼亞國代表到和會陳意見；但是蘇聯集團却在幕後持撑阿爾巴尼亞國；（二）保加利亞要求經由希臘的色雷斯，以獲得直達愛琴海的口岸；（三）希臘對於阿爾巴尼亞懷有領士要求，企圖取得阿國的伊比魯斯區。從這三點看來，也可以知道這個巴爾幹問題的復雜與微妙了。</p>
<p>第三英軍駐留希臘，在木年一月間聯合國大會時，烏克蘭代表即指摘英國，謂此事足以危害世界和平。英國當即答以英軍駐留希臘，係得希臘政府的請求而出此；這樣才使烏克蘭代表無辭可對，乃自動打消。今番曼紐斯基舊事重提，把英蘇兩國間所有一切的新仇舊恨，一齊引起來了。所以希阿兩國爭議，表面上僅與希阿兩國直接有關，實際上還是英蘇衝突的露骨化。在這件事實發生之後，一般人士，均爲和會的前途担憂，其實受其影響的，何祗巴黎和會而已，聯合國安全理事會能否排難解紛，而成爲維持世界和平的有效組織，也遭遇到一大攷騐。</p>
<p>放眼看看目前的世界大局，國際間的矛盾愈演愈烈，兩大集團的對立也日見明顯，各國對於任何一個問題，都有不同的見解，甚至各執一詞，辯論到面紅耳赤，也不肯讓步；因此國際爭議大有一波未平，一波又起之勢，大戰勝利結束，迄今一年，而眞正的和平尙未降臨人間。現在大家期待巴黎和曾成功，使歐洲政治早日澄淸，但是巴黎和會自開幕以來，已經「彌月」，只聽到各國代表的吵吵鬧鬧，卻看不見討論出一些結果來。道種情勢，如果不設法補救，則巴黎和會將陷於半眠狀態，即至本年歲尾，恐怕仍不能「圓滿閉幕」。現在倫敦巴黎華盛頓等處正盛傳着四國外長會議將有重行召開的可能。這未嘗不是一個辦法，但是我們對於國際會議早已司空見慣，尤其是在大戰結束後的一年來，橫一個聯合國會議，　一個外長會議，結果都沒有商得一個具體有效的辦法，徒然把我們的視綫移來移去而已。如欲國際會議成功，則非恢復戰時同舟共濟擊敗敵人的精神不可，聯合國唯有用爭取勝利的精神來締造和平，世界和平始有實現的可能。</p>

<h3>倫敦會議下月九日召集　討論巴勒斯坦問題　英已向阿猶民族發出請柬</h3>
<p>〔本報綜合消息〕英政府已發表定九月九日與阿拉伯及猶太代表，在倫敦舉行會議，討論巴勒斯坦問題。據聯合社倫敦電，英外部廿六日宣布，已向阿族各國政府，巴勒斯坦猶太公會，及巴勒斯坦阿高級執委會發出請柬。殖民大臣霍爾雖曾與猶太公會領袖商討會議問題，惟對公會發出正式請柬，尙屬首次。猶太公會執委會上星期在巴黎宣布，會議若以英美專家所擬之巴勒斯坦分治計劃爲根據，則猶太公會不擬出席。英外部之宣布，並未指明會議節圍是否將超出英國已接受作爲談判根據而美國尙未同意之方案。大約將先與猶太及阿拉伯代表分別談話，再作決策。</p>
<p>阿族參加會議提出四項條件</p>
<p>在英國發出請柬之同日，巴勒斯坦阿拉伯高級委員會亦發表備忘錄，宣示其參加倫敦會議之四原則：（一）反對任何形式之分治計劃，（二）巴勒斯坦應依據威爾遜總統十四點原則所給予赫森王之諾言，及大西洋憲章聯合國憲章享受獨立主權國之政治今權，（三）談判應以完全獨立爲基礎，而不得以貝爾福宣言或國際聯盟之委任統洽爲依據，（四）代表團在未曾徽得巴勒斯坦阿族之意見前，不擬作具體之決定。備忘錄中並謂倫敦會議雖無眞正之希望，但該委員會爲巴勒斯坦阿拉伯族之利益計，決定仍派代表團赴倫敦出席，至於前次所提之先決條件，即該委會主席耶路撒冷大主敎赫賽尼應爲代表之一，仍屬有效。惟據聯合社訊，耶路撒冷大主敎戰時曾與希特勒等沆　一氣，爲英國所憎惡，英官方前曾公開聲明不願邀其參加。</p>

<h3>蘇澳代表昨在和會中　展開一場新激辯　澳反對歐領土任意變更　指責四強作賣買式決定</h3>
<p>〔本報綜合消息〕據巴黎廣播：對義經濟委員會，廿七日開會討論賠償問題時，澳洲代表曾提出一修正案，認爲此一問題必須加以公平處置，前敵國之經濟情形亦應考慮及之，不應使其降爲他國之經濟附庸。對羅政治及領土委員會開會時，澳洲代表又提修正案，結果主張公正處理一部份獲通過，有關少數民族權利一部份爲蘇聯代表所反對。</p>
<p>據合衆社電，和會廿七日開會時又展開一塲新激辯，蓋因澳洲代表主張組織特種調查委員會，調查五國和的中四强所決定各種領土改變，其眞正根擬畢竟何在。澳洲代表稱，彼反對任何領土之改變，除非先期獲悉此種改變之一切幕後事實，並譴責四强會議中此種買賣式之領土改變決定。廿七日義大利政治委會開會時，研究對義和的之領土條款，其中四强主張義大利應將邊境地區四小處讓與法國，其時即引起激烈爭辯。澳代表霍奇遜聲明，澳洲不願盲目附和四强買賣式之領土改變決定，並建議應組織委員會，研究該項決定及其幕後之緣因，然後再向大會提出建議，四强指示，彼等對於澳洲此項建議，將力予反對。霍奇生稱：「澳洲不願受後人之批評，謂澳洲未曾明瞭事實而盲目接受四强之決議。大西洋使吾人（包括四強在內）負有二種義務：（一）除非出於居民之願望，不應有領土之變動，（二）尊重人民選擇其政府之法權。余欲請問四强是否考慮及此。</p>
<p>蘇聯代表維辛斯基於答復澳洲之領土建議時痛加抨擊，指責澳洲企圖延緩會議時間，指霍奇生爲「初入都市之村童，率爾操觚撰述歷史，而忽視其到達都市以前之情景。」維辛斯基謂澳洲之計劃，足以摧毀四强外次費數月時間撰擬和的草案所成就之全部工作。維辛斯基提出警吿稱，苟澳洲之建議予以接受，則將使和會遷延四月至六月。維氏云：比項建義使余想起一歌劇，其中之兵士高唱「前進，前進」，但事實上則站於原處。澳洲之建議，具有遷延作用之氣息。霍奇生答稱，蘇聯代表團企圖將其拳頭塞於責詢四强決議者之喉頭，繼即指斥蘇聯代表團使和會遷延。霍氏復提出一決犧，主張將領土變革之審查工作，限於爭執地區。其後另一澳洲代表皮斯萊又對蘇聯作激烈之攻擊；渠稱，吾人拒絕爲任何大國所威嚇，惟蘇聯代表團使和會工作遷延。此點應反覆加以說明，俾世界與論得知吾人已容忍一月之苦衷。英國主席李夫擬予以阻止而無效。皮氏曾以拳擊桌，並以手指直指維辛斯基。</p>
<p>據倫敦廣播對義經濟委會與對羅政治及領土委會於廿七日下午三時開會。至六時宣吿閉會。對芬政治及領土委會亦定於廿七日開會，但至最後一分錚予以取消。又據法國新聞社訊：保加利亞政治及領士委會廿六日午後開會時，白俄羅斯代表提出修正案，主張承認保國爲盟國共同作戰國，並承認該國甚至在與明國簽訂停戰協定以前，早已對德國作戰。該案提付表決時，贊成者使有白俄羅斯，烏克蘭·南斯拉夫，及捷克四國·其餘國家並蘇聯在內均表反對。蘇聯主張外長會議所擬草的常保持原狀。</p>
<h3>對義大利和約　我再提修正案</h3>
<p>據法國新聞社訊：中國代表團廿六日又向和會提出一項重要修正案，第一，關於義大利殖民地之命運，要點有三：（一）和會對於義殖民地之最後處置，應確定一項基本原則，此一原則，應與聯合國憲章所規定之託管制相符合。（二）和會應向世界宣言，採取任何決定，應將義殖民地居民之利益及願望，視爲最高因素。（三）以前殖民地在法理上之地位，應依照各殖民地之政治發展而分別決定之。準此而論，關於利比亞，和的應規定，立即許其獨立或由聯合國託管若干年。第二，關於修改對義和約草案第四節「對義特別利益」第十八·十九·以及二十條，使其與現行局勢相符，其中最重要之修正，厥爲「義大利允將天津前義租界所有一切財產及檔案，歸還中國政府〕。按草案原文規定「義大利允將前租界檔案巾所有關係文件歸還中國政府。」</p>

<h3>內爭依然不息　印危機潛伏　真納聲明仍無合作意　英駐印專員在遴選中</h3>
<p>〔本報綜合消息〕自印度臨時政府組織成立，印督魏菲爾發表廣播演說，向回敎聯盟呼籲合作以後，回盟方面之反響仍不甚佳，但談判之門則並未全閉。據路透社孟買電，回盟主席眞納廿六日夜發表聲明稱，印督魏菲　組織印　臨時政府之舉之乃最不智之行動，非政治家應有之態度，足以引起危險而嚴重之後果。余覺印督之廣播，實為對岡敎聯盟及回敎印度之一大打擊，但余　回敎徒當以忍耐奮鬥之精神，接受此項打擊，並可自吾人之未能在臨時政府及制憲議會中獲得合理之地位一事中得一敎訓。再觀新政府之人選，印督所指定之三回敎　員，均係不爲印度回敎徒所尊重及信仰者，此事實爲一種侮辱。吾人嘗一再聲明，回印分治乃解決印度問題之唯一辦法，印督廣播時曾謂「建議之門仍屬開放」，余識不知此語應作何解，但余對印督之代表國大黨申明目前仍需要兩大黨均有代表參加之聯合政府，並當縱續使回敎聯盟參加之語，則表示欣慰。</p>
<p>國大黨方面，主席尼赫魯旣已出任印度臨時政府之首長，故將於廿七日之執委會會犧中另行選任新主席。國大黨前任主席阿柴特及最近卸任之國大黨秘書長克里巴拉尼，似最有當選之可能。</p>
<p>臨時政府成立，正式行使職權以後，印督所領導之「保管政府」自即將宣吿結束，而代表英王之總督統治，當亦同時中止。據法國新聞社倫敦廿六日訊，唐寗街十號首相管邸宣佈，英國擬在印度設立高級專員公署，業已在積極籌備中，所有職員可望於九月中隨同代理高級專員西蒙氏前往印度。至於高級專員之人選，將由外務部任命，不日即可發表，大抵在十一月間前往履新。</p>
<p>據合從社電，目前印度之情勢，表面上雖似尙平靖，但事實上，內部蘊蓄之危機已日趨顯著，此尙不止一印回齟齬之內爭問題而已，尙包括着一個印度人民與英國統治者關係之整個難題，此事將來之發展，其嚴重性可能將使今日之所謂巴勒斯坦等種種問題，相形之下，俱吿遜色。臨時政府已吿成立，國大黨已握有壓倒一切之修勢，而該然口號，向係主張「英國統治者退出印度」、國大黨領袖兼臨時玫府主席尼赫魯曾公開聲明，臨時政府一旦成立，則英國所派之總督如尙欲行使任何權力，「即將與吾人發生衝突」。國大黨方面對於要求「英人退出印度」之態度，絲毫未嘗　變。一般觀察家俱相信，印度與英國全盤衝突之發生，爲期當不在遠矣。事實上，印回兩黨如欲諜取團結，求得印度之眞正獨立，自非轉移目標，向英國鬥爭不可也。</p>
<h3>我國保甲制　流傳至印度</h3>

<p>（三）如果蘇聯　利我們保持友善關係，我們不應使他　一五·一灰心，但沒有理由我們應特別努力於此</p>

<h3>國陸法庭管轄權　美正式宣布接受　—在美國歷史上尚屬創舉—</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿六日電〕杜魯門總統函聯合國秘書長賴依，宣示美國正式接受國際法庭之强制管轄權，此一措施在美國歷史上尙屬初次。美國駐聯合國機構代表詹森亦附函申稱，余今日之行動，足證我政府決盡其所能，使聯合國機構完成其任務。吾人認爲國際法律發展至目前之階段，已足資爲國際關係之導引及基礎。吾人復認爲保證國際法之繼續發展，並使其完成其任務起見，應使一切得受國際法庭裁判之糾紛，提請一負責之法庭裁判。深信該一法庭之職責，經普遍之接受後，則法律在國際關係中之地位，當能有重大之進展。詹森函中並聲明，國際法庭受理法律上之糾紛，以下列四項情事爲限：（一）條約之解釋，（二）國際法之施行（三）凡足以構成造反國際法事件之決定，（四）決定違反國際義務時所當賠償之性質及其重要性。但在下列三項情形則不能適用：（一）如發生爭議，雙造同意將此事件訴諸另一法庭者，（二）如若爭議在美國司法範圍以內者，（三）如爭議與多方條的有關係者。對於最後一項情事，所有簽約國與爭議兩造均願訴諸國際法庭，美國亦將同意提交國際法庭，此項協定有效期定爲五年，美國並得於滿期後之六個月內發表備忘錄·以決定其是否繼續有效。</p>

<h3>日圍棋競賽　吳清源首次代表我國　可能昇為九段棋手</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京廿六日電〕我圍棋家吳淸源本日首次代表中國，在此與日圍棋家橋本鵜太郎交手，連續十局。第一局於今晨七時開始，預料將着至夜半，下午五時半時，尙未見類著之勝負。吳氏與同屬第八段之敵手，橋本及其他日棋手三人對着，敵方先走着黑子。本日棋賽引起甚大之興趣，此諒爲國際園棋賽之首次。日全國圍棋學會將分給吳氏及橋本獎金各五千日元，以爲競賽助興，初不間勝利誰屬。吳氏此决如獲勝，其他着至八段之諸棋手可能尊吳氏爲（九段）圍棋家。按日本自七年前某國手逝世後，尙無人獲此最高榮譽。</p>
<h3>被吿辯護人一致窮詰下　溥儀作證昨結束　傀儡帝否認與日勾結謀復辟　各法官協議後准渠離開東京</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京廿七日電〕遠東國際法庭上，今爲傀儡皇帝溥儀出庭作證之第八日。八日來，被吿辯護人方面一再起立質詢，　證明溥儀係勾結日方自願爲傀儡者；而溥儀則一口咬定係受關東軍之壓迫，不得已而出任偽職，事前並未夢想復辟，事後且謀爲中國收復失地，惟心有餘而力不足。今日由辯護人岡本首先質問：「證人非爲再想做中國皇帝，收復紫禁城，而曾求助於日本政府乎？證人所不滿意者，非證人之所請求，爲日本所拒絕乎？」溥儀答稱：「此事完全係出捏造」。辯護人藤井問：「證人批准法令時，非有「國務大臣」加以說明乎？」答「說明甚簡單，且不能表示反對，一切由關東軍決定。溥儀旋又供稱，被吿星野由一九三六年十二月，至一九四〇年七月間，任爲滿「總務長官」時，偽部局長之一部份係東北人，偽科長階級之中堅幹部，亦多採用東北人，然</p>
<p>渠等皆係傀儡</p>
<p>而已。薩井乃問溥儀所信用之東北藉官吏係誰？此時審判長突宣稱：「此種訊問，無補於法庭，我等所欲知者，乃證人係傀儡與吾。無論如何反問，此證人決不推翻當時係在日本壓迫之下立塲。但我等是否信用此證人，乃屬另一問題。」藤井乃要求溥儀舉實例，以證明係受關東軍壓迫。溥儀答稱：「一舉一動均受限制，豈能一一舉例說明。」辯護人藤井又問溥儀，爲實現收復失地之目的，有無與中國取得聯絡？溥儀答稱：「因受</p>
<p>日方嚴密監視</p>
<p>未能取得聯絡。」問二一証人訓練之衛兵，其組織及經費如何？」答：「衛兵由中國人及蒙古人組成，中國人略多，經費則由余籌揹。」藤井復欲問經費之收入支出有無自由？被審判長駁爲「無關連性。」藤井乃轉而問鴉片問題，溥儀供稱：「一九三二年曾公布禁止鴉片網領，以圖絕減吸食，然一方面則獎勵栽植鴉片，栽植量年有增加，並强徵工兵墨生等從事栽植工作。中毒者由官方發給許可証，故逐年增加。」繼由辯護人馬太斯質問：「一九三一年十一月三日，証人晤見日駐津總領事桑島，桑烏吿以</p>
<p>日皇盼渠復辟</p>
<p>在滿洲稱帝，其時証人非表示希望復辟，問桑烏如何復辟，日本政府將作若何援助，並如何脫出天津乎？」答：「此事全係日方捏造完全無此事實。」馬太斯復問：「証人於一九三一年十一月一三日，未向桑島總領事謂：「復辟時期尙未成熟」乎？」溥儀答稱：「無此事。」馬太斯欲繼續窮詰，遭首席檢察官季楠反對，遂結束反對訊問。溥儀作証八日·至此乃在開末拉聲中退庭而去。繼由列席法官協議，决定准許溥儀離開東京。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿七日電〕國際法庭今日開庭時，各辯護人繼續與溥儀對質，努力証明溥儀熟中追逐僞滿皇位，並與日本全面勾結。溥儀則力辯出任偽帝係日軍所迫。審判長</p>
<p>魏勃表示不耐</p>
<p>當即宣稱：此種証詞已明白表示溥儀處於壓迫之下，法庭或將結束對溥儀之對質，此非吾人相信証詞之謂，厥因繼續對質，絕對無濟於事。被吿辯護律師今日欲証明溥儀由僞滿政府支給年俸日金三百萬元，其中八十萬元作爲「零用錢。」僞政府又提出公債五百萬元，溥儀可年收利息十五萬元。審判長魏勃止之，謂問題僅在溥儀是吾傀儡，其俸給若干與此無關</p>
<h3>法庭擬請專家　鑒別溥儀筆跡</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京廿六日合衆電〕東京戰犯法庭被吿律師，對溥儀之銳利進逼，已使法庭考慮聘請字跡專家證明「滿洲國」各重要文件，是否爲溥儀之手筆，蓋　儀稱，各文件俱爲　造，被吿律師自扇面上證實溥儀之字跡，溥儀曾以此扇贈與其英語敎師習士敦，後者曾著「朦朧之禁城」一書，此書描述溥儀之昌險生涯，書中印有此扇之相片，被吿律師解釋渠欲藉此證明「滿洲國」文件爲溥儀之手筆，故法庭准其所請，庭長魏勃向被吿律師稱：法庭開始藉字跡證明溥儀是否爲謊語時，勢將需要宇跡專家之協助。日本被吿律師今日復向法庭提及殘酷之「滿洲國」史上另一神秘命案，蓋溥儀前稱日人曾謀害一不友善之中國省長，然渠除含混之證據外，亦不能作更進一步之證明，東條之辯護律師淸瀨一郎謂：該中國省長係以合法審判手續定罪後而處決者，溥儀即駁稱：甚多人民俱係遭日人之暴行而致死者，然「滿洲國」之審判僅爲消除關東軍敵人之形式而已。</p>

<h3>孫田昌植罪行成立　決送法院拘押訊究　中紡職員舞弊　根據密報澈查　清查團將會商工作期限問題</h3>
<p>蘇浙皖區接收工作淸查團工作限期規定原爲五十天，現該團第一組駐滬辦公瞬已月餘，若干重要案件仍未吿一段落，目前吳委員望伋晋京向全國各區接收工作淸查團聯合辦公處邵秘書長力子雷副秘書長震，報吿上海接收工作淸查經過時，曾對工作限期是否可延長一節，有所請示，頃得邵秘書長覆示稱：淸查團各組滬杭爲最繁劇，滬上敵僞物資允夥，糾紛特多，工作困難，自在意中，五十日之限期本爲一般規定，如事實上不能大端戲事，擬再請求斟酌延長。又原議届期不完案件，可以移交當地監察使署繼續辦理，亦不失爲補救辦法。聞張團長及各委員對是否延長，日內將會商決定。關於孫田昌植案，經該團審核調查後，認爲資敵罪行，巳正式成立，現決將本案移　法院審理，被吿交地檢處拘押。倉庫部份，張團長今日將偕吳張兩委員前往軍政部所接收之各倉庫普遍視察，以後仍將陸續抽查，市立第四醫院經密吿檢舉秘售接收物資案，據該團調查人表示並無實據，刻正就當面調查報吿審核中。又經濟部中國紡織建設公司，內部組織不健全，職員營私舞弊，來團密吿檢舉者，已有三四起，聞該團正彙案澈查，務期得一眞象。此外對於教育機關學校房產地皮糾紛案件，將由張委員慶楨會同地政局處理。張氏服務教育界十餘年，對該類案件，極爲重視，張氏表示如有侵佔學校校產者，決予淸查發還。又昨午十二時上海市黨部，及靑年團部，曾假威海衛路新生活俱樂部，邀宴淸查團團長及全體委員，席間對一般淸查工作曾廣泛交換意見。</p>
<h3>貴生輪欲行又止　結關後仍被吊銷　所裝貸物通知起出　海關承認一切損失</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕英商怡和洋行船務部貴生輪，此次由港載救濟品經滬駛靑津，因在滬裝貨載客，妨礙我國航權，經輪船商同業公會反對，致於二十六日結關後，復被吊銷。該行船務部昨晨十一時半，向各報關行宣布停止裝貨，其已裝入艙內者，亦須起出。據該行負責人告記者稱：貴生輪此次應聯總委運救濟品，運往靑津，帶裝客貨，事前均得海關當局准許，故各報關行簽單報關，均蒙放行。各貨車至碼頭，亦經關員騐訖裝船，一部份貨且已裝入艙內，嗣聞各方反對，爲愼重起見，於上星期六，復向當局請示，承特別通融，允許爲最後一次之裝運，乃於二十六日下午三時前，將結關及領事館等出口手續辦妥。不料於五時許，海關突來電話，令將結關單送還，並聲明准貴生輪裝運客貨之錯誤，承認一切損失。各報關行代表，聞訊大爲驚異，當由某高級職員發表辦法，在船內及碼頭上之貨，如不車去，可堆入黃浦，與大連汽船兩棧房，棧租由行承認，一切損失請來函述明，以便彙集後，向海關交涉。至於報出之關單，不必再報退關俟裝他船時改單，海關亦已允許。貴生輸裝貨各報關行，昨午集議商討，結果未詳。該輪原定今午北駛，因須卸貨及重行結關等手續，今日恐不及起椗。客票雖已登記，幸米售出，故無庸辦理退票手續。至於救濟品係香港裝載，仍須運靑津交卸。</p>

<h3>茶業協會招待新聞界　報吿茶貸真相　域明外傳舞弊域毫無根據　希望政府續辦貸款</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國茶業協會，昨假香港路銀行公會招待本市新聞界，由理事長麥景偉報吿茶貸詳情稱：我國茶業經長期抗戰，對輸出停頓已久，勝利後，農商均缺乏資金，從事生產或製造，故本市各茶業團體，分向行政院·四聯總處等各有關部會申請貸款二百億元。嗣後經叫聯總處核准浙皖二省茶貸七十億元，其分配額：祁紅區十八億元，屯綠區十五億元，平綠區二十二億元，溫州五億元，龍井五億元，其他五億元，貸放對象祗限於產地茶廠，其辦法，（一）由上海茶葉輸出業公會會員公司商號開列自營合營及特約茶廠，並塡明製茶箱額，資金及所需貸款數目等項，送請中農銀行核貸。（二）申請貸款之茶廠，需由上海茶業輸出業公會會員爲承還担保人，茶款則由中農各地分行直接貸與茶廠，訂立借約，並需三家連環担保，且由承還人蓋章證明，手續殊爲週詳嚴密。近某報載茶貸有舞弊等情，實爲捕風捉影，毫無根據，中農銀行亦將爲此發表聲明。又稱：茶貸雖核准爲七十億，然實際僅貸出五十二億又七千萬元，若以今年各區毛茶收購成本計算，每担平均需十四五萬元，故茶貸款項僅足收購毛茶三萬餘担，而實際上各廠所收購毛茶數量·平水。屯綠·二區已各約三萬祖左右，且一部份已精製成箱。祁紅區已精製二萬餘箱，每顆成本的合二十萬以上，故各區所欺　之毛茶總額已超出茶貸數倍·由此亦可證明茶貸舞弊之說，實不可能·茶商汪增寰唐季珊等，又講述茶業之危機，仍極嚴重，蓋外匯提高後，美國茶價合法幣每磅仍不過一千四五百元，而國內成本每磅在三千元以上，故新茶迄未出口，亟盼政府速即辦理出口津貼，以爭取國際市場，並續繼撥精製貸款及二茶貸款。最後由壽理事長提議，向政府請求豁免或减低百分之十通稅稅收，汪振實並提議加增內銷，全賴交通之輔助，製造之改良，更希同業能效法台灣焙製方法，以爭取外銷地位，至四時半散會。</p>
<h3>中農發表辦理茶貸經過</h3>
<p>又中國農民銀行發表辦理茶貸之經過云：「查近日報章對本行春季茶貸，有不符事實之新聞紀載，本行爲使社會明瞭眞象起見，特將茶貸辦理經過情形，發表如下：按本年春季東南區茶貸，係政府核定方案，交由本行承辦，其經辦情形：（一）貸款對象爲各產區之茶塲或茶廠（共二百餘家），以上海茶商爲承還保證人，由東南區塲廠聯合會及茶葉輸出業同業公會作初步審核介紹，再經本行按照各區生產狀况核定承貸數額，與承還保證之各茶商在滬先行簽訂協議書·（二）全部貸款，均屬由各產區如屯溪·紹興·溫州等行處，依照協議書，與當地塲廠簽訂借約，在當地貸放。（三）政府核定茶貸總額共爲七十億元，本行按各塲廠產收槪况爲標準，共核定茶貸額爲六十一億元，除各地場廠有因外銷不振，經營困難，自動放棄者外，計實貸總額共五十二億。（四）塲廠承領貸款，應將收購茶葉裝　繳存抵押，近據各行處寄滬表報，各區廠商收購毛茶數量，莫不超過貸款。復查今春奉命舉辦之際正値各產地交通異常困難，但本行爲適應時機，救濟茶農起見，並承中央銀行協助，不顧一切困難，盡力設法調供現鈔，以備各地廠塲收購茶葉之用，一面由產地行處根據協議書，審核當地塲廠情形，分別貸放，並隨時派稽核人員巡迴督察。綜觀各塲廠取得貸款之購茶經過情形，對於茶農經濟，裨益至多。現貸款已陸續到期，因國外茶市呆滯，本行正盡力設法協助其外銷。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕「現在上海有沒有老虎？」聽到這句話之後，你一定想到兩家公園裏的動物園罷？但是，八年抗戰之後，動物園裏的鳥獸都遭到了刧數，運復興公園裏僅有的一隻老虎都因害肺病死了，月夜經過復興路，久巳聽不到樹　裏傳來低沉的虎嘯！</p>
<p>但是，上海現在還有一只碩果僅存的老虎。剛到上海來的時候，他還祗出世了四　，重量也祗有二十多斤，現在已經十四歲了，體重也已增至二百多斤，如果他現在還在深山　莽之中，一定巳經學會了吃人！可是他目前的環境却使他非常溫順馴良，主人也非常愛護他，每天給他的食料是牛肉九斤，鷄蛋十五隻！因爲　養得很好，所以毛色非常光潤，叱咤一時的「山君」變成了善伺人意的「金絲雀」。他的主人更為他取了一個美麗的名字，叫作「花兒」。當他一聽見有人叫「花兒」的時候，他就會溫和地把頭抬起來；但是，如果惡作劇的人們用鐵棒在勞邊一碰，他還是會咆哮起來——但是他無法衝出　　　　　　　　　　　，因為那裏是用不着門　的。你如果也要去看看的話，我可以把他的地址吿訴你，他在中正中路（前愛多亞路）中南飯店樓下的　明堂藥局，他的主人就是四明堂的主人老醫師　濟。現在，花兒是四明堂的活商標，將來，花兒的遺骨大概就是供他們作虎骨木瓜酒的。　　爲籠中虎（本攝報）</p>

<p>查擄人勒贖之罪如於擄贖進行中接洽贖欵，雖得論以帮助犯，要必有帮助該罪之意思爲要件，如無正犯之意，且與綁匪並無聯絡，僅爲被虜人之家屬求託向匪說贖，仍難論以帮助勒贖罪，最高法院民廿二年上字第一〇九二號判例有案。詹榮培係申新第二及第五廠廠長，現榮德生子榮爾仁交誼甚深，榮子爲營救乃父出險，故託詹榮培說贖，而吳志剛乃利用其與詹共營華大企業公司之關係，隨即進行談判，其並無意思與匪聯絡，業經袁仲杼吳志剛等承認，而受被綁人家屬委託向匪說贖一節又爲榮德生之子一再呈明屬實，供證在案。旣無犯罪行爲，自應諭知無罪。</p>
<p>顧初十雖與袁仲杼係兒女親家且爲袁之房東，其　參加犯罪意思亦無分得贓欵之事實，已經袁伸杼供明。至於借與袁之法幣卅萬元，經查明係榮案被綁前之借貸，更與本案無關，而在其屋內搜出之美金五百元及法幣三十萬元係袁之徒弟趙吿甫所密藏，已經袁仲杼自白在卷，該趙吿用曾經緝捕未獲。</p>
<p>吳吉雲有妹吳月生在淪陷期間爲黃阿實擄去作妾，吳吉雲經營帆船業，寓居上海，與黃雖有往來，究無參加議案之事實證據。</p>
<p>陳駱氏係駱文慶之妹，陳志和則與陳駱氏拼居多年。駱文慶以分贓所得美金三千元寄存其妹陳駱氏家中，案發後此兩人　係牽累被捕。</p>

<h3>跑馬廳賽馬能否恢復　須提交市參議會討論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於本市擬將恢復跑馬廳賽馬一說，議論紛紜。現據硏究該項計劃之負責人稱：關於恢復賽馬利弊得失問題，認爲在市府經濟拮据之目前，恢復賽馬未嘗不是開源之一途。且視本市投機之風如此猖獗，則賽馬亦不失爲正當之娛樂。遠言之，若一旦市府經濟充裕後，可將跑馬廳買下，闢作草塲，供全市市民娛樂之用，則是更合理想矣。關於上項意見，雖曾再三考慮，然仍須待即將召開之參議會通過後，方可實現。</p>

<h3>不交定貸涉訟案</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市華英企業公司，因向聯營公司定購貨物發生糾紛涉訟一案，已兩誌本報。茲據華英公司總經理蔣魯棠昨日吿記者稱：該公司於本年一月十四日曾與聯營公司經理勤斯堡訂的，向美定購Pabco油毛氈一千捲，價美金五千五百另二元二角七分，約定於本年三月底以前交貨，如不能裝船交貨，則屆時應將全部貸款退還，簽約時當付定洋八百二十五元，至二月十八日，又由中央銀行電匯美國貨款美金四千六百七十七元二角七分，全部貨款，是時即已付淸，乃勤斯堡藉口交款較遲，交貨亦須延緩五星期，華英亦無異議，其後，勸斯堡稱，貨物已由Sea　Belenng輪由美起運，並出示電報，不意事隔數月·杳無音信·七月十三日，勤斯堡又謂該貨於八月十七日可以裝船，但問其船名爲何，則又諉為不知·華英逐約彼晤談，不意彼竟又避不見面，逐於七月二十二日，具狀黃浦分局，請求緝捕，以免逃亡。當即於警局中和解，由勤斯堡允承退回貨款，勤即簽發美商大利銀行A三七八四二三號八月二十二日期支票一紙，票面金額法幣二千另八、五萬元，並於調解時註明「決不通知銀行將該票止付」等字樣，而　英公司至期前往支付，竟又遭退票，遂再具狀，控訴勤斯堡虛設字號，詐欺取財之罪，墟　總經理稱，今春油毛氈在滬市價，每捲可售至七萬元，此一千捲之貨如能準期交付，價値當達七千萬之鉅，僅向勤斯堡索還貨款二千另八十五萬，該公司損失已鉅。該公司向勤斯堡定購之貨，除此油毛氈一批外，尙有「油毛氈柏油」六十五桶，水泥二百噸，雨衣一千二百件，貨款皆已於數月前付淸，勤斯堡亦未交貨。</p>
<h3>謹防扒手　摸竊法門十四種　「技術」大表演　眼明手快賽時遷</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕在上海，無論你坐在電車裏也好，在馬路上走也好，有一句最要緊的話千萬不可忘記，這句話就是：「衣帽物件，各自留心　」</p>
<p>全上海有四百多萬人，這許多人有各式各樣不同的職業，按理，眼明手快的人找起職業來自然便當得多，但是有不少人却就靠了「眼明手快」，做起「沒本錢的賣買」來，他們追隨於水滸傳裏的鼓上蚤時遷之後，學會了做賊！</p>
<p>在最熱鬧的老閘區裏，警局每星期總要抓到幾十個「摸竊黨」，抓到之後，就把他們的頭髮剃光，以便旁人容易識別，但摸竊並非大罪，所以處刑往往很輕，普通不過拘禁一個星期或者十來犬，就把他們釋放了，他們出來之後往往謀生乏術，於是有許多就又繼續了他們的老本行。</p>
<p>老閘分局在最近一星期中，又捉到了竊犯五十二名，其中有二個是少女，一個是十六歲的王美弟，一個是十八歲的陳愛珍。這許多人中，年紀最大的已經五十七歲，名叫盧玉林，最小的是畢鴻彬，今年還祗有十四歲！</p>
<p>昨天，警察局爲促進市民注意起見，在該局空地舉行了次一摸竊技術大表演，表浪的是從這五十二人中選出來的四位「選手」。原來摸竊方法，竟然也有十幾種之多，現在就一一記在下面：（一）「推黃包車」，由二人搭擋，一個人橫擋在黃包車前面，車子停下·後面的一人就想法搶車上的東西；（二）「跑菜戶」，專偷買小菜的人籃裏的菜錢或者竟是魚肉之類。（三）「跑平地」，三四人搭擋，一在地攤上賣襪衫之類，引得鄕愚圍觀，乘機扒竊。（四）「闖　堂」，以問訊爲由，闖巡人家，偸取零星衣物。（五）「包電車」，電車乘客擁擠的時候，在上下車時扒竊，有時在車上高呼「留心鈔票」，乘客不期而然的用手按摸藏鈔票的衣袋，他們就看準地方，隨時動手。（六）「拋頂宮」，又名「捉烏龜，」即搶帽子。（七）「扒圾垃」，見人鈔票凸出衣袋，一人在前面撞，一人動手。（八）「割包」，專偷自由車後所帶的東西。（九）「落地扒」，行人手携物件，疲倦時將東西置地稍憇，扒手即乘其不備，順手牽羊。（十）「甩包」，一扒手將偽造金飾擲地，貪小鄕曲拾起之後，後面即趕上一人，與其交涉，一定要拿回一點錢才肯罷手。（十一）「調包，」將褲料之類，低價在馬路兜售，乘討價還價之際，將眞物掉換棉絮稻草之類，（十二）「拋大劃」，以迅速手法，偸取鋼筆。（十三）「定風」，在行人圍觀熱鬧之際摸取鈔票。（十四）「行風」，在行人往來不經意時下手。</p>
<p>扒竊黨中頗多衣冠楚楚之流，這些人又有一個別名，叫做「將官」。全上海就有許許多多這種「將官」，率領部下，天天橫行于光怪陸離的大上海！</p>

<h3>開水竟成靈藥　吳稚老漸復健康</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前幾天吳稚暉氏身體不豫的消息傳出後，許多人都極表關切，現在，關心吳稚老健康的人們可以放心了，因爲稚老熱度已經退凈，而且能坐起來寫字。稚老這次得病的原由，是因爲在天氣熱到一百多度的那一天，到交通大學去演說了一次，那天雖然「赤日炎炎如火燒」，稚老的興緻倒極高，話也說得很多，早晨去了到下午四五點鐘才回家。稚老一向吃素，曾經說過他唯一的「營養」祗是每天飯後打一個午覺，這一天就因爲回家稍晚之故，午覺沒有睡成—於是頭暈目眩，就有些中暑的樣子，塞熱也高起來了。</p>
<p>但是他還是堅持一貫作風，不延醫，不吃藥，連他的子姪輩請他吃點丸藥都不肯答應。病中除多多睡覺之外，祗肯喝些開水。有一天情形很重，但「吉人夭相」，開水竟成靈藥，慢慢的倒痊愈起來了。</p>
<p>現在稚老的熱度已經退凈，祇是身體仍感衰弱。最近幾天又起坐寫字了，因爲收件很多，所以一寫就往往連寫七八件。別人看他精神疲憊，腕力也不如前，請他休息幾天再動筆，但是稚老還是力疾揮毫—原因竟是爲了生活問題！</p>
<h3>美軍事法庭上　上幕有趣插曲　日籍律師以手勢指示證人　檢察官指責引起題外辯論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美飛行員荷克少校被香港日軍殺害一案，昨晨繼續開審，仍提出被吿久保日外中佐作證。法庭上發生一幕有趣之插曲，即首席檢察官杜威指控日籍辯護律師M.Kumoshiro以手勢指示證人，雙方引起題外之辯論，致本案可稱毫無進展。緣因杜威對證人發問時，其站立之地位適遮住辯護席與蹬人間之視錢。辯護人向庭上提出後·杜威即宣稱其所以站立此地位，係防止Kumoshiro以點頭及手勢尋指示證人。Kumoshiro起立否認，辯稱彼之小動作，係因譯員譯詞不準確，故有煩躁之表示，並要求將杜威之指責自記錄中抹除，因將來庭上複閱時，恐不利於被吿。另一辯護人波爾少校，亦作同樣要求，並請庭上對於檢察官所發問題，加以限制。各審判官商議後，對於辯護人之要求，不予受理，惟宣稱將使檢察官之問題切合木題。審訊遂繼續進行，惟因辯護人方面仍極表不滿，杜威自動移站於較遠之處。綜計昨日久保所證述極少，檢察官問以如荷克之飛機受高射砲擊中下墜，因而觸沉船隻，是否亦屬有罪，久保答非所問，不能決定。</p>

<p>〔中央社太原廿七日電〕幷市各界，廿七日晨八時，在文廟舉行孔子誕辰及敎師節紀念大會，到萬餘人，儀式隆重，是日各機關團體學校，放假一日，全市縣旗。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨爲孔誔兼敎師節，本市各界均縣國旗慶祝，並休假一天，以資紀念外，各敎育團體，於昨晨在市長領導之下，分別在南市文廟，及市體育館，舉行隆重祀孔典禮及敎師節慶祝大會。昨日上午九時正，吳市長國楨即準時到達南市文廟，自稱：「此係戰後第一次謁廟，按抗戰前二年，當出任漢口市長時，曾到過文廟一次，然二次情形已大不相同，上海市之文廟，因受戰爭影響，己荒蕪不堪，恐漢口市亦不能例外。</p>
<p>九時半，祭禮開始，吳市長於願意來的西裝外，套上一身藍袍玄褂，緩步踏入大成殿，站在主祭者地位。時殿中古樂悠揚，由孫裕德領導下之國樂研究會，正奏演「祭孔曲」。陪祭者：敎育局主任秘書王汝昌，民衆敎育館館長徐則驤，第四區區長邵心石等，分立兩旁。陳念曾　儀。吳市長三獻禮香後，即由民敎館主任鄭于鳳恭讀視文，文曰：「大哉孔子！時中之聖。德參天地，道冠古今，共山川而不朽、並日月以常明，周遊列國，删訂六經，垂爲榘矱，樹茲典型，拯世運而臻治理，躋大同以頌承平。大哉孔子！師表萬世，爼豆常馨，以蒸以享，來格來臨，伏維尚　」。讀畢，全禮向孔子神位行三鞠躬。在孤兒院樂隊演奏「進行曲」中，全體退人大成殿。</p>
<p>吳市長於離開文廟後，即趕往亞爾培路市體育館，主持敎師節慶祝大會。參加者，有敎育部　任督學陳東原，敎育局主任秘書王汝昌，市黨部代表周斐成，靑年國書記長曹俊，及中小學校代表千餘人。主席台設在體育館正中，壁上張貼標語：「默而識之，學而不厭，誨人不倦，於我何有哉？」行禮如儀後，主席吳市長致詞，略謂：國過程中，最有功效的是敎師，一個國家的上軌道與否，其責任全在敎師。爲什麽把孔子誕辰定爲敎師節，因爲孔子是世界上第一偉大的敎師，孔子之偉大，在於：（一）其有改革社會之理想，（二）凡事有不妥協之精神，（三）終身奉行中庸之道。吳市長並謂：做敎師者，必須學習孔子之美德，並要以身作則，要責人，必先責己，要別人不妥協，自己先不妥協。若人人具此决心，則深信中華民國必能踏入正軌。繼由陳督學東原發表三點感想：（一）慶祝敎師節，必先追念大師孔子，因爲孔子不但是中國人的模範，更爲全世界人所敬仰的，（二）學習孔子之「知其不可爲而爲之」及「不知老之將至」之精神，表達理想，決不罷休，（三）要　孔子一樣富有理想，敎師最大的功勞，便是把自己的理想，去影響學生。陳督學又稱：孔子誕生於紀元前五五一年，距今二四九七年，則大後年爲孔子二五〇〇年之偉大誕辰紀念，當胡適之等前在美國時，已在籌備盛大紀念會　　　　時室有一番盛祝，在這三年之中，吾人應當爲敎育而加倍努力。　由敎育局主任秘書王汝　，國民敎育處處長朱君楊，中等敎育處代理處長謝恩高等相繼致詞，語多　勉。大會迄十二時餘始散。</p>
<h3>日本採用　新敎科書</h3>
<p>新地理課本亦出版</p>
<p>〔改造社東京廿七日電〕據麥帥總部二十二日發表，日本國民學校及中等學校用新敎科書，殆已全部完成，並已開始印刷及配給，由九月新學期開始採用。試觀其中新地理敎科書，紙張粗陋，裝訂作小册子式，旣無地圖，亦無插整，外觀因陋就簡，內容則相當進步，注重於科學的思想及科學的方法，令學生考察地理時，知悉鄉土與歷史之關係，同時强調和平精神。五年級日本地理舊敎科書第一課，首謂：「翻開日本地圖看看，無論怎樣看，形態總不平凡」，其主觀色彩甚濃厚，而新敎科書則謂：「我國是亞洲大陸東方太平洋上的島國，由大小島嶼而成」，遠較前者具有客觀性。聞此次新敎科書，尚屬暫時性質，文部省方面仍在繼續作根本改訂之研究。</p>

<h3>消滅棉紗黑市　官商協力進行　商廠按期撥紗聯合配售　經濟部議組織統籌機構</h3>
<p>（太報訊）對於紗布黑市、聞經濟部王部長有設法抑平之决心，民營紗廠業負責人表示，亦願協助政令，平定物價，據消息靈通者指稱，近週黑市之漲，民營紗廠未始不爲之寒心，其出品應否受紡建統籌支配，業中人已商討多日，前日紡建邀集談話後，空氣更濃，昨日因此會議多時，决按期撥紗若千萬件，與紡建合併平價，公開酏售，且已推　委員洽談，此舉一經實施，當能和綏市面空氣不少，因從前紡建屢次漲價，輒藉口市而上漲，國營並無讓民營　獲重利之議務也，棉紗棉布販賣商，聞亦正在籌謀，對會員商號嚴加整飭，以免　動黑市，但總以紡建開貨實况、同業公會未能明悉，控制爲難，且有若干小廠及各路客帮，必須有版賣商號爲之居間接濟，紡建開貨如不普遍均勻，此種小廠及客帮，將感受困難，據棉　品複製工業界消息，棉紗黑市如不消滅，則各廠勢將停工，並據指稱近日棉紗黑市之漲，已使正當廠商無從辦貨，紗布市塲上，近日常有以紡建成交單加價　售者，該業負責人對此，極爲憂慮，據其表示，以後紡建開貨，如能邀同公會到塲貢獻意見，則此稱　事，可　减少，有地位之觀察者談稱，今後紗布產銷、可能增重統制意味，政府决不致再　放任，以自毀其平定物價之立脚點，並稱紡建已在　租廣廈、以擴充其業務機構云，</p>
<p>（本報南京廿六日電）經濟部次長潘序倫，廿六日晨由滬返京，據談；經部爲求紗布市價趨於合理，將加强棉紡織管制委會，並擬邀各民營紡織業主持人參加，而　國民營紗廠所出紗支統一配銷，價格亦由該會負責評定。至　市棉紗廠盤與黑市相差縣殊之原因，則則於紗業中黄牛黨抬價所致，部方正設法制止。</p>
<h3>工廠配煤　燃委會不漲價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自外匯變動，柴油汽油等進口貨不免上漲，惟煤市尚稱平穩，其原因得力於燃料委員會之維持配給價為多，該會最近又有大批工廠用煤開派，工廠因上次配貨，品質不言，尚多觀望，但據該會經辦人表示，對此已有所改進云，茲探錄其配給價於后，（浦東碼頭交貨單位噸）開　二號　或基隆　十四萬元</p>
<p>又一號　　十五萬元</p>
<p>又特別　　十七萬五千元</p>
<p>又二號塊　十七萬元</p>

<h3>增加僑滙　在各方面推進中</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕此次匯率調整主要目的之一，在誘道僑民匯款回國，頃開當局對此事，已予注意，荷印僑匯及僑貨，將按新措施，使僑胞能蒙其利，馬來僑胞匯款所受限制，亦正籌擬變通辦法，使匯款數得以增加。</p>
<h3>桐油產價飛漲</h3>
<p>出口土產地價格，自外匯調整以後，莫不望風而漲，桐油價格因受滬地喊價影響，漲勢不可過，故出口桐油，將因產地之　日漲價而感因難，綜觀一週以來，漢口桐油漲起百分之六六·四，杭州漲起百分七二·三八，金衢蘭方面漲起百分七六·五，就市價而論，杭州方面，現貨殊缺，售價爲每市担九萬五千至十萬元，金華衢縣蘭　方面，每市担就地交　爲九萬元，貨缺價亂，均未入正常交易。</p>
<h3>昵羢外強內容弱</h3>
<p>自外匯調整，百物行情均漲，呢羢進口成本，確實增高不輕，各號開價，因此無不水漲船高，如美國麥爾登，前日又上漲三千元一碼，然觀其內容，則大有外强中乾之態，（一）在未漲時，生意根本淸淡，今再漲價，買方欲進，復又延期，（二）棋盤街帮外·大半均負有高利貸，今乘機會，均皆樂於脫貨而還債，（三）到貨源源，九十月份滙票早已購妥者占多數，人心究屬虛弱，因此根據大家之月光預測。此次漲價，猶如重病打强心針耳。</p>
<h3>證交經紀人　已核准二三四名</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據確息：經濟部最後核準之第一批經紀人名額，共爲二百三十四名。證交即依此項名額，在市塲中佈置位置。又證交　委會自於日前召開第十三屆籌委會後，證交內部應用之各項印刷品，塲地設備，辦公室佈置，及人事審查種種，均已進入最後階段。九月九日，決可如期開幕·聞證交總經理，將屬王志莘·協理將關　善昌云·</p>
<h3>美貸低價競銷　於我未必無利</h3>
<p>〔南京電〕美國物價調整後，宣布改正美國出口貨訂價之章程，其目的在防止國外市塲美貨之售價上漲，美國售與外國之貨物，再依照國內之限價，約加合理利潤手續費及保險費之成本，工商界認爲此舉，將使美貨在我國更為暢銷，影響國貨銷路，記者走訪經濟部重要人員，詢問對此事之感想，據談：一般銷費物資，可能因此暢銷，我國必需物資將運獲利益，汽車一項，上海售價，顯較美爲高，其原因進口商之利益過高，美政府限制商人利益，汽車價錢即可减低，有助我交通之發展，其他必需物資，可望因此减低。</p>
<h3>限制進口貸說中央澈查來源</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕外傳我國將禁止外國棉紗及五金進口，並謂此一消息係中宣部紐的中國新聞社所發出者，記者曾為此事訪國際宣傳處處長會處白，據謂：南京方面並未發出此項消息，爲辦明事實眞相計，已電紐約辦事處查詢。按此訊係合衆社所傳出，關務署及　　總稅務司已加以否認。</p>
<h3>法國擬訂購　茶葉兩萬担</h3>

<p>中美農業技術合作關　茶葉組赴蘇考察茶市</p>
<p>中美農業技術合作團，以皖蘭蕪湖爲皖茶業集散地，特派茶葉組技術人員三人，，赴　實地老察，聞皖省府對蕪湖，本擬促之成爲一茶葉中心市塲，茲經中美農業技術合作關注意之後，常更謀其迅速吿成，則蕪湖除爲長江流域米糧中心市塲之外，又爲皖茶之吐納口。</p>
<h3>食油漲價　社會局商討對策　棧單限五日提貸否則囤積論　廠商請調整配價免單獨吃虧</h3>
<p>食油價格，近又扶搖直上，（廿六日）漲至七萬九千元，幾達八萬關，市社會局正與有關各方及油廠商，商討有效對策，目前已採緊急揩置，對食油棧單嚴禁在外買賣，限五日內持單提貨供應，否則以囤積論，除棧單無效外並依法懲治，據業中人談，此次漲價原因，係製油原料之菜籽，受外匯調整之刺激而漲價，原料漲，成品亦漲，廠商方而，請社會局斟　實際情形，調整配價，以免廠商單獨吃虧，减少不合理之現象，其决，目前各廠，以動力關係，未能如理想生產，順餘，大有餘，大昌新，長德，大德新等五廠，每日出產量尚不足五百担，中國植物油料廠，亦以動力關係，無法增加，各廠商甚盼動力能有適當解决，惟目前本市食油存量，仍極充沛，即中國食汕公司一家，在貨有一萬一千餘担存黃棧，故業中人希望該公司在此時際，能大量拋出云。</p>
<h3>外貸所向披靡　國產時鐘無力對抗　鐘廠向政府請求援助</h3>
<p>外貨擁入，百業均受打擊，中國時鐘製造業，最近已發出緊急呼籲，茲將各情分誌於後：</p>
<p>中國製鐘工業概況</p>
<p>我國製鐘工業，在　前已有煙台之德順興，永業，永康，德安等四家，上海之中華，昌明，中華電鐘，上海等四家，每年約可製銷十七萬架以上，抗戰期內，上海復創設中國，中明，金聲，遠東等四家，每年亦可製銷廿萬架以上，此係就實際製銷之數字而言，若無外貨進口，則生產數字，猶不止此，市塲除供銷國內外，兼運南洋　島，迨經八年抗戰，運銷停滯，迄今成品山積，苦無推銷市塲。</p>
<p>轉勝為敗危險萬分</p>
<p>但目前之國貸時鐘廠，又被外貨　得體無完　，美國中型時鐘，每架定價約爲美金一元五角至二元，以三三五〇外匯率計算，合國幣五千〇廿元至六千七百元，加運費及關稅百分之四七·七，亦不過計國幣七千四百餘元至九千八百餘元之間，而本國製浩者，原料一項，每架已需一萬五千餘元，再加工資及廠繳一萬五千餘元，合計中型鐘成本每架在三萬元以上，與美貨時鐘相較，超過三與一之比。</p>
<p>全部鐘廠發出呼籲</p>
<p>本市全體製鐘業工廠，已於最近採取一致行動，請求中國全國工業協會，速予電呈行政院及有關各部會，要求（一）修正進口關稅，將時鐘提高徵稅，或列入A項第一款，限制數量進口，（二）　鐘原料如木鐘之發條，電鐘之漆包綫，及新式　械等，減免關稅，以鼓勵進口，以上二端，有關該業之存亡絕續，要求政府立即實施云。</p>
<h3>「及時」鐘戈維持原價</h3>

<h3>淮上行</h3>
<p>— 本報廿三日淮南快訊　特派員邵慎之</p>
<p>「江淮之間，五方之所聚也，百貨之所集也，田疇沃衍之利，山川藪澤之富，遠近之不能及也。」—顧祖禹　淮南道上</p>
<p>從蚌埠到皖西，可以溯淮河而上，也可取道淮南鐵路的水（家湖）蚌（埠）支綫。現在淮南鐵路正辦蚌埠到正陽關的水陸聯運，這條通路便成為西行的唯一孔道。</p>
<p>肥沃的淮河冲積平原，以「十年倒有九年荒」著稱，是不可想像的。然而現在的潦原水勢，是一個事實，歷代南北分爭，兩淮變成一個緩衝地帶，而且隨時成為戰塲，其存亡影響天下的得失。在不統一的中國，這片土地更從軍閥手裏拋來拋去，民對官匪，其印象無分軒輊。明太祖崛起江南，桓溫用江淮之甲，均勢奄中原；朱溫劉福通起，聲引淮上，史家以之論淮上民風，證為強悍頑梗，實則都是人民自求出路的表現。歷史決不是宿命的，中國倘能安定，兩淮是第一流政治家施展長才的地方</p>
<p>現在搭車自蚌埠到水家湖，沿途看不到一個稍稍整齊的村落，一片平原，農作繁雜，不如太湖流域有整齊的稻作，因此更顯得土地分割破碎的厲害。油麻，水稻，高粱，粟米，芝麻，紅薯，大豆，煙草，大麻，以上九種，普遍出現在這塊土地上，簡直看不出那一種是主要作物，此外則有少量的棉花。和向日葵實則其中可算煙草佔多，綠色正盛，在秋風中堅強地開着紅白色小花朶，高粱穗則已染成深紅色，有的已經摘去，只剩桿子，或植或倒，等待乾枯各種作物的高度參差，綠色濃淡不齊，高粱則特別稀瘦，可以看出其施肥和耕耘都沒有應有的深度。土地是好土地，歷年來無規則使用，更加使土質淡薄，這告訴我們什麽？農民投付於土地的除開單純而薄弱的勞力而外，就不再多有其他的東西，現在這些濃淡不齊的綠色還可以說明這些精疲力竭的農民還黏附在這裏。如成草莽，他們便不再是農民。</p>
<p>他們一向屈服於人為，現在更難與人為的自然災害抗爭是明顯的事實。車到武店從黃姑　中泛　起來的水逐漸展露於目前。站東一橋，橋座被水浸鬆，車子停住，有路警來逐車通知乘客下車步行，讓空軍皮緩緩駛入武店站，然後再搭上車去繼續西南行。可是到五十二公里處的第三號橋，一端橋座完全冲挎，據說這是第三回，十天內恐還不能修復。車子只能在橋的兩端接運，卸客運貨，差不費了兩個多小時，這路每天本來有兩趟客車，現在改成一趟，乘客遂特別擠，客車車皮不夠，故以高邊車代替，乘客在烈日下一路烤過來，其苦可知，還要爬上爬下搶坐位，汗出如漿，從武店一直到水家湖以北，路兩邊一片汪洋，只留狹狹的一條路基，多處枕木頭子下面已沒有土，水還在下面餂蝕，速度僅十五公里，以策安全，坐在車上望出去，疑心是坐在船上。所以火車停在那裏接運，時間一長，大家煩惱，肚餓口渴，幾乎每節車裏都在吵架，叫罵的聲音，嘈雜不堪。車長忙極了，往來奔走，愁眉蹙額。一個滿身補釘的老太婆從三四里外隔水趕來，手提一壺，說明是冷水，「你看多淸！」可以賣十元五十元一碗，買了一壺又一壺，因為這不是路旁的泥漿。</p>
<p>車過水家湖北閘，速度較高，從蚌埠到田家港八十餘公里，要歷八九小時。水勢之大，使這條搶修甫竣的交通綫受到了嚴重的打擊。</p>
<p>第八綏靖區司令部　參謀長徐啓明中將</p>
<p>碉堡礦廠</p>
<p>一個月以前，李先念部二千餘人從豫南鑽出來，在羅集下塘間突過淮南鐵道，越津浦路到蘇北去。皖中情勢弄得很緊張。現在稍為安定，然而碉堡處處，軍事空氣十分濃厚。從田家庵到淮南礦，短短十公里內，有水泥鋼骨碉堡一百多座，上面有照明燈設備，廠礦所在，電網重重，都是日本人所遺留，淮南路局萬餘員工，如藉此鞏固了可獲安全的一個信念。</p>
<p>抗戰前的淮南鐵路，係自懷遠南岸的田家庵到裕溪口，長二百十四公里，附帶在九龍崗舜耕山麓經營一個煤礦，這個私人企業只正式經營了兩年不足，廿五年一月通車，廿六年十月奉令破壞，廿七年六月全綫淪陷。淮南礦日產煤二千餘噸。另一個私人企業大通煤礦月產兩千噸，全賴這條運輸出口。及至去年接收，路礦面目全非。自水家湖至裕溪口一百八十八公里一段，已在卅三年給偽華中鐵路局拆去，另築一條現正通車的水蚌支綫，溝通津浦，改由陸運供煤。</p>
<p>以商業觀點來看，淮南礦必須自求出口，發展新的運銷路綫。惟不仰賴於別的運輸機構，才能便於經營。日本一以運輸船隻缺乏，且易受轟炸，通江運輸，已非必要，而津浦綫已逼於必須作分段供煤的計劃，以應軍事的需要，從水家湖修出短短的六十一公里卻是一舉手間之事，然而這一綫除運煤外便別無用處，況地臨正陽關我軍前綫，正是軍事前方，遂選綫倉促，建築亦復粗糙異常，日本投降以後，共軍的破壞攻勢，對此亦不放鬆。大通淮南兩礦，日本軍部派員駐礦催煤，數年來，這兩處私人企業單位一切已被合為一體，現在分也不好分，日本軍部下令要多少噸，也只得儘量去開，器材缺乏，尤其是木料，因此開挖不循常軌，弄得一團糟，所挖之處，險象環生。</p>
<p>吳競淸局長說：「我們來接收了亂七八糟的一堆，日本技術人員在這裏的表現是一塌糊塗。」還有那些少數部隊，有想在黑煤裏淘出些什麽珠寶來。他告訴我那隻宿舍裏惟一的浴缸，還是他在田裏發現後抬回來的，「他們搬去喂馬。」無法無天的故事一大堆，使人毛骨悚狀，驚詫不已。</p>
<p>六月一日，支線修復，總算通車了，把煤運出去，接收以來，半年辛苦，大家喘下一口氣，可是現在路一斷，煤只好積着，將來通運時又要加一重裝車的人工，加重成本不少，水家湖玉裕溪，路基仍在，可通汽車，皖省公路局在此收養路費，顧名不能思義，實為一種汽車通行稅。路局正在修橋補路，還是希望復軌，可是材料成問題，加拿大方面頗有投資的興趣，合作方式還沒有決定，然而一個企業在碉堡環拱之下，是中國建設的一幅強烈諷刺書。</p>
<p>導淮會工程處晝夜督工之孫·王兩工程師</p>
<p>復車近景</p>
<p>事業的遠景完全依托於和平安定。</p>
<p>吳競淸局長曾在美習機械，在德習電機，他以西門子工程師資格回國，裝建著名的戚墅堰電廠，「今天看來真是一個渺不足道的電廠。」曾養甫部長時代他是浙贛路局長，交通部的材料司長，現在應聘於淮南路公司董事會，任正局長，他是這碉堡陣中的事業的主持人之一。去年十二月十六日正式接受完畢，據統計全路的損失是八分之七，他們接收到三個殘破的車站，卅里鐵路，能用和作廢的車皮三百多輛，機車十六個，能走動的只有三個。戰前則有車皮七百輛，機車五十六個。水蚌支線是敵偽所築，雖然是從淮南拆去材料，但這屬於政府，交通部說：「橋歸橋，路歸路，這是敵偽產業。至於原來的淮南損失，終有一天會賠償的。」現在水蚌段係向政府租用，月付租金敷百萬元，約等於客票收入總額的六分之一。在這種產權關係下，以常情論，則這條支線的加強勢必有限度，能暢通就好，承租人決不會自行電氣化，種種客觀條件決定了中國的停滯。</p>
<p>田裕復車的近景是存在的，幾十億的資本已投了下去。能修的機客貨車已經修出，報廢的也在修理。我曾參觀過淮南局的機廠，正在把鐵蓬車改裝三等車廂，增加彈簧配上玻窗坐位，通風防熱，周身油氣，一輛新車即可出廠，這並不容易，在簡陋的設備中顯然在硬幹。目前在路上行駛的一輛頭等客車，接收時只有一個空壳。經過三個月的裝配，居然在六月一日通車之前，完全應用。此外還造過一條五十公尺長的橋鋼樑，修橋補路中的大工程之一，苦工程之一。這廠裏有不少十五六歲的少年工人，廠長柳新民也不過卅來歲。他們一致相信只要有軌材，六個月後即可復車。然而買不起，配不到，國有鐵路目前還不知其命運哩。</p>
<p>路礦兩局</p>
<p>這路局包括路礦兩局，由副局長胡衛中，寗樹藩分別負責。大通礦已合股到淮南局，因為日本人已給他們打通，不合也得合了，大通淮南兩礦，目前日產煤一千五百噸，每月以三萬五千元一噸的價格供應津浦路九千噸，以每噸六萬元價格供應煤焦管理處三萬噸，這管理處等於一個國家貿易公司，配售出去時賺一筆錢，工業用煤可以賣到十二萬元，別的配售煤還要高價。「幾十億元給他們賺去了。這些錢如果在我們手裏，就可以向國外現款購貨，立刻可以復車。」吳競淸慨然說。</p>
<p>兩礦日夜輪班開工，捲車一天廿四小時不斷轉動，此起彼落，從井裏吊出煤來，煤層傾斜有七十度，挖時頗費人工，原來一百公尺處，數年來被挖得非常危險，現已不敢進去。只好再向下挖深，循常軌開採，有一井須挖深至三百五十公尺，煤車吊到底要兩分鍾，這還須十個月才能完成。大通礦設備較佳，產量可及戰前之半，但明年此時，大約可以超過戰前產量。兩礦都在鑒新井，預計要在二三年後，可以出煤，那時漸可及五千噸。</p>
<p>局中人工超過一萬，每天給白麵粉三斤半，工資則分等級，從二三萬元至十萬元左右不等。局方說入不敷出，月月蝕本。</p>
<p>日本人在田家庵造了一個電廠，可惜只有一座空房子，一架三萬基羅的機器剛運到大通，日本就投降了。可見日本人還想在這裏多挖些煤出來。現在的發電機如果全開動，可以有五千多基羅，但是還用不到這麽多。</p>
<p>田裕復車是一個近景，礦的增產是一個近景，還有電力設備，只要有機器裝上去，一部電力可以使用於農墾，雖都在望，但企業的發展，尚待政治合理化，和平安定，從碉堡叢中解放出來！</p>
<p>已被水浸入之淮關市梢街頭（特派員邵慎之攝）</p>
<p>舜耕洪水</p>
<p>從淮南路局所在地的九龍崗向西步行二三公里，就到達舜耕山。</p>
<p>歷史傳說舜曾在此耕種。舜也不過是歷史傳說時代人物，然而這或可證明周代以前，中原的民族已經順流東下，在這一帶發展農業，迄秦漢而鼎盛。「舜」遂成為這民族和時代的代稱。「舜」以前不是有「夏禹」治水的傳說嗎？禹走九州（也據傳說），水利興，農業隨之，都是可以說得通的，無論如何，歷史上有過這一段經過卻是無可置疑。現在舜耕山隆起於澤國中，真是歷史的不幸啊！</p>
<p>我馳行淮上，看到洪水成災，老百姓躲在樹上；這時卻跑到舜耕山麓，這中國人為了緬懷歷史成績而取名的地方，看到許多農民正在夕陽下治田，起伏於煙草叢中。舜耕山逶迤東西，實際上不過一帶土崗，他們似已忘卻了光榮的古代，自甘於痛苦的命運。他們確實不會有這類的歷史知識，正如培根所說，因為沒有知識，便失去了權利。可是，雖則他們不知對三代之治概嘆緬懷，但從現實的生活中，汲取了最現實的知識。培根的知識論不過是功利論而已。</p>
<p>我同一羣農民談話，所得到的結論是十分可驚的。他們全靠雙手，不用一點工具，正在摘下煙草的花穗，以及桿旁的細葉。使兩手沾滿黏液。</p>
<p>「先生，」一個中年農人對我說：「這花可不受用，摘掉了好讓煙油到葉子裏去，葉子好厚一點，担得起分產。今年收得不好啊，你看，那半塊地都給水浸壞了，那樣小的葉子是不能用的」。他用手掌扶起一張重鈿鈿的八吋來寬的葉子，繼續說：「總要這麽大，才能賣得起錢。」</p>
<p>我問他們一畝地可收多少葉子，可以賣多少錢，他們說這塊田今年只能收兩担多，往年總要三担出頭點。至於賣多少錢就難說了，賣到過十多萬，可是新葉子一出來，已經跌到六萬幾了。今年炭又貴，還要化人工去　哩。不好算了。</p>
<p>「先生，你是曉得的，現在外國煙來了，我們的煙葉難得起價呢。」另外一個農民正從葉叢裏鑽出來，從田裏檢起一塊乾鬆的泥塊，在手掌裏擦着，因為他手上已經沾滿了煙草上的粘液。他在偏僻的鄉間說這話使我一怔。他年在五十開外，滿面縐紋，膚色紅黑，身體健康結實，載一頂寬邊草帽，口含煙袋，露出一口整齊的黃牙，使我想到加利福尼亞的美國佬，我想他一定是老闆了。可是他說：</p>
<p>「不是的，老闆在家裏呢，我們都是幫人家做的。」</p>
<p>他們一起五個人，分別屬於兩個老闆，兩個是本地人，三個則來自泰縣和頴上。他們這樣一說，分明全是僱農了。一個老闆種十畝地，一個則僅種五畝。這樣小的地主，居然也有長工。差不多他們每人管三畝。他們不全種煙草，還種一點高粱和水稻，高粱一畝收四担，現在市價是二千五百元一斗，這不過種些來自己吃，煙草才賣錢。</p>
<p>老闆管他們飯，一年給十幾萬塊錢，這就是他們的全部待遇。</p>
<p>「那裏夠用？我們還算好的，別的人家只出到八萬塊一年哩。」那個戴闊邊草帽的說。</p>
<p>從去年陰歷十月起，到今年十月至，他們這一年的僱傭合同算滿了。去年十月裏講好不過是四萬塊，一個春天物價飛昇了十倍，他們在陰歷六月裏向老闆說，錢不經用了，一定要加，這在加到十幾萬，可是也沒有確數，總得到十月裏才能拿淸，老闆也不好當呢。</p>
<p>「嘗嘗我們的煙好不好？只是沒有香料，你們怕吸不慣。」那個中年人說。</p>
<p>我自然歡迎極了，我們一齊在田塍上坐下來，他在煙草桿上撕下一片新鮮的黃葉，把熏好的深赭色煙葉碎屑捲在裏面，仿佛像一支雪茄，裝進我的煙斗。初吸的時候覺得十分醇，以後便愈吸愈覺得辣，終於沒有辦法再吸了。</p>
<p>夕陽向舜耕山後沈下去，已到歇息的時候了。那中年人問我：「先生，你是來買葉子的吧！到我們老闆那裏去坐吧。」</p>
<p>我說：「不是。」</p>
<p>「那麽你是那邊礦上的？最苦不過是做莊稼，在你們那裏當裏工就夠強呢！」</p>
<p>路局的農地也真像莊園一樣，有不少從各地來的僱工種地，每天有三斤半麵粉，工資是每月二萬元。</p>
<p>這些僱農們無田無地，靠出賣勞力生活，担心年紀大了怎麽辦，羨慕着路局裏工的待遇。我們的談話忘卻了已經西沈的夕陽。（寄自九龍崗）</p>
<h3>馬尼剌：吉普之城</h3>
<p>— 七月廿六日航訊　中央社記者邢光祖</p>
<p>整個馬尼剌市，好似是一座吉普城。吉普車輛之多，可說是任何城市所少見的。這些褐色的摩托爬虫，　集　動，在馬尼剌市街，簡直是沒有一秒鍾的閑暇，這些吉普，許多仍是軍用的，一部分已經改作民用，大多數經過改裝後成為公共汽車，在任何地區招徠乘客。而這些「公共汽車」也漆成各種各樣光怪陸離的顏色，並且張貼着許多惹人注目的廣告。</p>
<p>盜竊案日必數起</p>
<p>你躑躅或是站在任何街頭，你可以聽到這些牟利的摩托爬虫，按住着輪腳，在招呼你「加波（Quiapo）去麽」？「巴綏（Pasay）去麽」？聖皇（San　Juan）去麽？你要是鑽進了它的甲殼，便可以瞧到那些膚色曛黑頭髮蓬鬆的車夫，在要弄着機盤，他們口裏不時地在吹着口哨，或是哼着民歌，跟着車身的顛簸，成諧和的節拍，有時候拖着奇異的目光，用西班牙音調的英語問道：「你們是中國人麽」？「你們那兒來，上海是不是」？「你們是不是來經商的」？</p>
<p>車子走過一排僑胞的店舖，他們會告訴你：「這些都是中國人的店家，他們都很有錢呢！」</p>
<p>每天早上八時和午後二時是馬尼剌最喧雜擁擠的時候。六七排的車輛並列在十字街頭，有時會挨上卅分鍾不能通行。等到交通警一聲警笛發出，這許多等候最後衝刺的摩托蟲齊鳴的一聲馳去，好似牢獄裏發放出來的一羣瘋狂的囚犯，直向着一個方向奔着。但是在許多比較狹小的交叉路口。並沒有警察來維持交通的秩序，那情形便兩樣了，多數的車輛擠成一堆，伺隙而東，全像無羈的野馬，把全車的生命交付與車夫的理智和機警。有時候在開到中心的塲合，逢着橫裏刺來的車輛，不得不亟力煞住，哇的一聲正像燒燙尾巴的動物在慘叫</p>
<p>這裏的交通，每每給人一種混亂的印象。車輛旣如此之多，而各街口維持交通的警察又特別地少，車子在爭先恐後無法控制的情況下，徒然使交通梗阻，躭誤時間。此外吉普改裝的小型公共汽車並不設車站，起訖無定　，尤其在任何地點可以招納乘客，有時會從車輛稠密的行列裏擠到路旁，使後面的車子手足無措。</p>
<p>因為車輛多，所以竊車之風盛行，差不多竊車案件日必數起，但是很少能破案的。據說竊去的車輛多數開往較遠的城市去兜賣，（車輛執照是不限區域的），因此就無從調查，許多車主雖然自能駕駛也時常雇用車夫，因為在辦公或者接洽事宜的時候，必須有人能夠看守車輛，否則，隨時有失竊的可能。同時汽車間的建築也比住宅堅固得多，雖然車門及汽車都上了鎖，晚間有些聲息，還須仔細提防。最近曾發生一件荒誕的盜車事件，地點是在市區中心，一輛停在路旁，並且有車夫看守的汽車上，忽然躦進了幾個強盜，拿出手槍逼着車夫開往郊外，到了冷僻地方，他們便勒令車夫下車，然後駕着揚長而去，而車夫祇是眼望着塵埃飛揚，無計可施。</p>
<p>目前這年靑的島國最感棘手的問題，是怎樣建立一個獨立的經濟，因為財政支細，經濟破碎，所以造成社會上許多不安的現象。最顯著的便是盜刧案，打開每天的報紙，幾乎沒有一天沒有盜案發生。據警局報告：平均每日有三十起之多。我們知道一個政府最基本的任務是維持社會治安，使人民能夠安居樂業，然而今日的馬尼剌，菲律賓共和國的首府所在，竟然是盜賊橫行。</p>
<p>綁架與少女失蹤</p>
<p>這是日常發生的事情，跟這種盜案在數量上相埓的是綁架和少女失蹤。據馬尼剌　　所　未成年罪犯調查局（Tuvemile　Bureau）發表的報告，自本年正月份起，該局受理的犯案越過三千件。正月份有七百四十四件，二月份是六百八十三件，三月份有七百八十四件，四月份有六百四十九件，這是提呈檢察處辦理的數字，其餘因證據不足未加受理的，還不在其內，同時翻閱每天報紙分類廣吿欄裏，總可見到「失蹤」「招尋」「儲款以待」等離奇的廣告，警署接到這種失蹤案平均每週三十起，失蹤的多數是妙齡女郎。</p>
<p>根據警署統計少女失蹤佔失蹤案總數百分之八十，年齡在十五至二十之間，而失蹤時間是晨八時至中午，差不多每有天幾起，警署裏面總有年老的父母涕淚縱橫地報道女兒的失蹤，「她十八歲，上唇有粒黑痣，那天她着的是粉紅色短衫和裙子，頭髪並不長，但鬈鬈地兩邊分着」而警署方面有時候因為這種案件多數和私奔有關，也就淡然處之，許多情竇初開的少女，看中了人許是一個美國兵，或是同班的同學，但她家庭又十分頑固，這情形就容易釀成私奔了。最近有位大學的校花，拒絕了男同學的求愛，那同學有一天把她挾上了汽車，開往冷僻的郊外，諉稱沒有了汽油，祇好在外面躭了個晚上，終究如願以償。所以警署官員常對報案的父母說：「讓這小妮子在外面躭上幾天，等她回來，也許會有喜事呢！」於是招尋牌上又多一個妙齡女子的動人玉照。</p>
<p>貧窮是社會不安的主因，貪慾是民族道德淪亡的原因。目前瀰漫在菲島的，就是這種可怕的貧窮和貪慾的現象。所以那些助桀為虐的通敵份子，那些殺人越貨見奸黨匪徒，祇要稍微扭曲一不法律字彙的意義，甚至可以不加闡釋，便可以罰鍰釋放。諸如傀儡政府總統羅勒爾的延期審判，偽教育部長奧西亞斯（Qsias）的罰　五萬元的開釋，以及許多不宣佈而吿解決的案件，使人疑心金錢的作祟。此外再如關卡的勒索，移民證的辦理，裝置電話，須納小費，開設餐館，賄通局員，都可以顯示菲島民政上種種的缺憾。</p>
<p>僑胞在馬尼剌市</p>
<p>旅菲僑胞總數約計十三萬人。在馬尼剌一市，數在七萬以上，僑胞來菲，遠在麥哲倫發現菲律賓前五百三十九年，那時候中菲早已發生通商關係，宋元以降，迄於民國，國人欣慕菲島風光，渡海南來，難以數計，千餘年來，菲島受着我那文化的熏陶，可說是根深蒂固，又因為我僑胞的刻苦經營，使菲律賓成為太平洋的繁榮區域，自公元前九百九十二年以來，中菲兩國就互為婚媾，發生血統關係，就地理而言，馬尼剌距香港六百三十一海里，離廈門六百七十五海里，距上海也不過一千一百六十三海里，實較世界任何重要商埠為近，中菲兩國，旣具有悠久的歷史關係，密切的文化和血統交流互連的地理接壤，難怪一般僑胞，認菲島為第二故鄉，稱中菲為兄弟之邦</p>
<p>僑胞在菲，由於客觀的地位和本身的特點，不能改革社會，又不能發展工業，所以經商成為僑胞生活的要素，在戰前雖因為政局動盪未能予以合法的保護，但是由於中菲通商歷史悠久的關係，僑胞仍執菲島商界的牛耳，戰前僑商在菲投資總數在一九四一年以前，約佔全菲百分之八十，等到太平洋戰事爆發，日寇侵入菲島為止，因為戰爭的影響，入口貿易的銳減，和當地菲商的爭競，降至百分之六十，但仍能左右菲島的商業，僑胞所經營的主要的是出入口商和零售商。</p>
<p>戰前僑胞中的出入口商，主要的投資是煙　，米，麻，椰乾，木材及各種土產的貿易，但是經過這次的戰爭，菲島的土產均已破產，日寇佔領期內，多數物資遭受搜刮和破壞，目下菲島物資陷於極端的恐慌，人民生活所需，有賴於入口貿易，因此入口商品仍是供不應求，僑胞中各大中商人自下對入口貿易的投資總額在二萬萬元以上，在幣額上已越過戰前一倍，所以我們可以說入口貿易成為光復僑商經營的中樞，其次是零售商，因為集資較少，經營較易，僑商中從事零售的為數甚多，成為僑胞商業社會的主要成分，惟其因為人數過多的原故，常常受到菲方直接的壓迫，例如菲國國會裏提出的零售商菲化，菜市菲化等法案，對於僑胞生計勢將發生絕大打擊，業已造成不可幸免的危機，希望我政府當局，能努力促進中菲邦交，訂立商約，對於一般僑商，予以合法妥善的保障。</p>
<p>目下僑胞在馬尼剌一市所設置的學校，大概有二十餘所。其中中等學校凡三，以菲律賓，中正中學（校長係鮑事天氏）為最具規模，僑胞教育方面，現在所遭遇的困難很多，日寇統治菲島，雖則三年，但對文化教育所施的摧殘甚劇，原有中小學校舍大率被焚，校具圖書儀器以及書案等物，損失殆盡，要從事重建，則又經費無着，此外還有師資缺乏和小教薪津過薄等問題，也亟待解決與改善。</p>

<h3>津市碉堡　十日天津航訊</h3>
<p>— 介公</p>
<p>天津為華北最大商埠，有七十二沽分匯於五大河以入渤海東達遼瀋，西抵舊京，為北方諸省入海之咽喉，屹然為一重鎮。自七七事變後，津市首被淪陷，而倭寇即以此地為華北兵站基地，倉庫林立，工廠星佈，此外並於塘沽建筑新港，工程浩大，動工三年，可見倭寇用意之深，而市內外諸般軍事上之防禦建築，亦較他處獨多，是以在去歲日人屈膝乞降之前，此間一般居民，以為如果美軍在華北秦皇島或大沽口登陸，則倭寇必死守天津，地方糜爛，不堪設想，因此人人自危。</p>
<p>津郊治安　日趨嚴重</p>
<p>去歲八一五倭寇投降，盟軍國軍相繼進駐，市內繁華，頓復事變前之舊觀，而一切軍事防禦建築，亦均陸續拆除，尤自政府開放外匯後，市面益見繁榮，一般市民，以為從此可以安居樂業，旅津之各地人民，可以陸續還鄉，不想共產黨即於今春在華北各地發動破壞策略，初則拆毀鐵路，轟炸橋樑，繼則攻城奪地，燒殺焚掠，不數月則遍地烽火，蔓延華中。津浦路北段，自山東德州陷落後，共軍即積極北進，滄縣，靑縣，馬廠，數度圍攻，均被擊退，而北寗路北平至唐山間之一段鐵路，兩側潛伏共軍尤多，津郊各地，亦不時有共軍出沒，是以津市治安日趨嚴重，茲將各方面最近情形分紀於左：</p>
<p>九十四軍　集中駐防</p>
<p>津市自和平後，地方治安，即由國軍第九十四軍負責，最近因地方防務吃緊，市內各衝要路口及有橋樑之處，均由九十四軍派工建築伏碉及碉堡，尤以舊日租界各街口之伏碉建築最多。碉堡高者有兩三層，儼然形成戰塲，一般居民睹此，不免驚惶，而物價亦因之波動上漲。</p>
<p>對津封鎖　小販吃苦</p>
<p>據一般由四鄉入市之小販言，共軍對於津市，已採取其一貫之經濟封鎖政策，各種小販如不幸而與彼輩相遇，則貨物及法幣均被沒收。如與理論，竟有當塲被刺殺者，是以目下菜蔬，菓品都物，均感來源不足，物價因是趨昂。</p>
<p>民眾自衛　力量增強</p>
<p>此間當局因時局之關係，為增強民眾自衛力量，全市十區已開始市民訓練，編制採一三制，即一大隊分三中隊，每中隊分三分隊，每分隊分三班，每班為十五人，大隊長由警察局各分局長担任，中隊長由警察局各分所所長或分局組長担任，自上月份開始以來，成績尚好</p>
<p>商民募款　慰勞國軍</p>
<p>此間各界因九十四軍自駐防以來，維護地方，賴以安寗，現當防務吃緊之時，又值　暑期內，駐軍殊多勞苦，故由商會發起聯合各業聯合會及各區地方團體，籌募捐款三千萬元，送往九十四軍軍部，以示慰勞。</p>
<p>美軍夜間　共同佈防</p>
<p>津市治安，除由九十四軍担任維護外，駐津美軍因各地美軍近來迭遭共軍侵害，是以每晚十時後，美軍司令部按時遺派武裝兵士，分往津郊各要路口佈哨，重要地區並加派坦克車防守。每晨五時後，始行澈回。每晚十二時，即禁止行人來往，河北一帶駐軍地區，晚十時後即禁止交通，次晨五時始行解嚴云。</p>

<h3>一代文豪韋爾斯最具鼓舞性的人物</h3>
<p>— 墨衢</p>
<p>英國著名科學，政治，歷史，小說，著作家韋爾斯，著作等身，計有小說二十餘種，幻想著述十九種，短篇故事四巨帙，社會宗教政治各問題的論文十二冊，此外，尚有小冊多種。他的著作風行全球，（我國亦有譯文數種）曾在思想界發生偉大的勢力。凡歐美及以外各地讀他著作的男女增多了不少知識，甚至社會的風尚多少也因他的理想而有變動。在英國文學中堪與吉伯齡蕭伯納齊名。茲已於本月十三日在倫敦家寓逝世，享壽七十有九。這使世界尤其英是國文學界喪失一位最惹人注意最具鼓舞性的人物。英國哈默頓所編輯的世界名人傳載有他的小傳，茲據其要點，並綴以最近報紙關於韋氏的紀載，而成本傳。</p>
<p>出身寒微</p>
<p>赫勃特·喬治·韋爾斯，一八六六年九月二十一日生終坎特郡白羅姆萊鎮，出身寒微，父是職業板球員，在鎮上設一雜貨商店，母是旅館主人的女兒。夫婦倆生存在世時，從未有過快樂的享受。雜貨商店失敗關閉後，母乃被迫入某巨室服侍女主人。由於家貧乏資的原故，韋爾斯十三歲即出學校，充某化學師的助手，不久又改入某衣店服務。這全違他的本志，故在業餘之暇，研究學問，孜孜不倦，因此得於一八八二年謀得米特赫斯特文法學校的助教職。後又賴辛苦經營，獲得獎學金津貼金，而入倫敦大學肆業，一八八四年在該校動物學系以最優等畢業。</p>
<p>此後數年中，他曾充大學生物學助教與講師，但他對終寫作的興趣，却日見濃厚。一八九三年受亨萊　〔英國著作家〕熱切的鼓勵，毅然投入報界，從事筆墨生涯。兩年之從，第一冊著作「SelectConversatons　with　an　Uncle」初次問世。</p>
<p>從那時起，韋爾斯的生活可稱全是理解力的發展，流露在其出版物中，極其充實。法國名著家法郎西欽佩備至，稱他為「英語世界中最大的理智力量」。他第一冊成功的小說The　Time　Macliine（一八九五年出版）表現他是一位有科學思想與靈敏想像力的人物。但道位熱情的青年社會主義者對於當時的世界，却心存厭惡，這是在他描寫新時代遠裔Morlocks與Eloi兩人的凄凉景况中河以顯然察覺的。</p>
<p>友敵驚異</p>
<p>韋爾斯在他的自傳中告訴我們：他由柏拉圖與亨利喬治〔美國經濟學家〕而傾向社會主義。當他在南垃辛頓求學時，對於法比安會社〔Fabiau　Sociafy〕社員的行為，寄以熱烈的關切，但他不忍耐的情態，却日見滋長。所以在短時期內，他不贊同正宗派的革命學說，覺得馬克斯這人處在社會主義的世界中，猶如一個夢魔。因為他向用全教口吻的言詞否認智力應具的順時應變性，而韋爾斯却認此性為他最貴的寶藏。故在其生涯的初步階段中他便決定取獨立的革命方針，這種獨立，他曾保特到老。他的才智的生活力曾驅他屢屢改良地位。他像百色鏡一般常常更變他的意見。</p>
<p>韋爾期易於變化的心性，使友敵都為驚異不置，但在這心性之後却伏有一種永久不變的廣大哲學。韋爾斯是一位深明一種使命與靈感的人物。他以十字軍軍人的殺力和狂熱踐行前者，而宣傳後者。他不信賴一時感情的衝動，却虔誠相信人類最後的理性，所以他自己常常尊重理性。他以激昂的熱誠發洩他的厭恨與愛感，但一切總以理性為歸宿。這種態度可能的是他一生最大的錯誤。他對於人類日常生活中所特現的愚鈍，不能忍耐，而加以鄙視，這使他自己大昧於人類天真的實在性。</p>
<p>文學概念</p>
<p>因此霹爾斯的文學生涯開始便注重宣傳，而繼續不已。假使他願意的話，憑他的才能可成當代最煊赫偉大的小說家，可是「為藝術而藝術」的理論，在他的心目中却是一種詛咒。曾有一次他答覆亨利詹姆士（英美小說家）驚人的抗議道：「文學在你，猶如繪圖，是一個目的；文學在我，猶如建築，是一種方法，而有用處」。</p>
<p>從這種文學概念產生了小說若干種，而列入現代文學最卓著的成績。繼「The　Time　Machine」之後，他又寫了幻想與科學小說若干種，如「The　InvisibleMan」（一八九七年出版，一九三四年曾就題材攝製電影，極受觀眾歡迎）。「The　Ｗar　of　The　Worlds」The　First　Man　in　The　Moon」（一九〇一年出版）「The　Food　of　The　Gods」（一九〇四年出版）「The　War　in　The　Ａir」（一九〇八年出版，乃預測大戰的情狀）。以及「The　Ｗorld　Set　Free」，（一九一四年出版）。其中每一種都以推測科學發展的可能性，叙述生動的體裁，富於辛辣的諷刺，表現它的特色。他的巨帙作品「The　Stolen　Baccillus」（一八九五年出版）與「The　Plattner」（一八九七年出版）顯露他是一位具有幽默天才擅長短篇小說技能的著作家。他的「Love　and　Mr.　Lewisham」（一九〇〇年出版）與「Lipps（一九〇五年出版）經多人認為文學的傑作。在「Ann　Veronica」（一九〇九年）與「The　History　of　Mr.　Polly」（一九一〇年）出版後，他的令譽因以固足，既成偉大的小說家，又成當代社會生活的深刻批評家。他又在「Anticipations」（一九〇一年）與「First　and　Last　Things」（一九〇八年）二書中將地的思想和盤托出。（按據最近報載他尚有「Tono　Bungay」「The　Country　of　The　Blind」「The　Man　Who　Couldwork　Miracles」三種，都為精心之作，也屬小說之列。）戰爭著作韋爾斯關於戰爭的著作有「The　War　Will　End　War」（一九一四年）「The　Peace　of　The　World」「Bealby」（這是一種絕妙的幻想）「The　Research　Magnificent」（以上三種都在一九一五年出版）「Mr.　Briling　See　it　Through」（一九一六年出版，對戰時一國精神所作的動人紀述。）「The　Soul　of　a　Bishop」（一九一七年）「In　The　Fourth　Year」（一九一八年出版，乃對國際聯盟所作的批許。）以及「Joan　and　Peter」（一九一八年。）他所作的許論，與他意中以為讀者從這些著作中所可得到的定論，常常乖異，但他有自認錯誤的勇氣。歐戰終止後十餘年中，他鑒於世人獲得解脫禍患的機會，雖一時鼓舞興奮，抱改造世界的新理想與新希望，且公認他為智識運動的領袖，但不久故態復萌，漸漸放棄他們的新努力，中心很感痛苦。他又豫先見到國際聯盟祗作討論，而無行動的實權，不但不能達到和平，反而有使國家主義日趨强烈的危險。所以在他的著作中往日所抱的理想涿漸消逝。但他在初數年中仍抱悲天憫人之志，而於「The　Salvaging　of　Civilization」（一九二一年）與「Men　Lipe　Gods」二書中極盡發揮理想主義的能事，曾由許多讚者認為人類所能想像的仙境的最可愛之夢。此後的著作却回復他早年對社會所施的嚴厲鞭責，如「The　Dream」（一九二四年）「Christina　Alberta's　Father」（一九二五年）「Democracy　Under　Revision」(一九二七年）「The　Solbonne　Lectures」「Meanwhile」（一九二七年）「Mr.　Blettsworthy　　on　Rampole　Island」「The　Way　the　World　is　Goltng」（一九二八年）「The　Autocracy　of　Mr.　Parham」（一九三〇年）「After　Ｄemocracy」（一九三二年）「The　Buspington　of　Blup」（一九三三年）都可證明這位熱心改革的理想主義者在大體上雖不失韋爾斯的本色，然而對於人類的信仰已經動搖了。但他的天才並未因此受創，他的毅力亦並未因此減弱。他早年曾抱寫著人類偉大史實的志願，他不畏事功艱鉅，終在戰後以三部曲告成他的計劃。第一部分對於往代人民作為動廣泛的叙述，那便是「The　Outline　of　History」（一九二〇年出版，此書曾銷一百五十萬冊，韋氏因此致富。）繼以「The　Science　of　Life」（一九二九年出版，此書乃與G.　P.　Wells及Julian　Huxley合著。）那是詳紀生物的進化；最後完成大功的是「The　Work，　Wealth　＆　Happiness　of　Mankind」（一九三二年）那是一種社會科學的大綱。</p>
<p>韋爾斯的哲學，最初見於Anticipatiotns一書，後經多年的變更，又在「The　World　of　William　Clissold」（一九二六年出版共三。（「The　Open　Conspiracy」（一九二八年出版，韋氏稱此為世界革命的藍本，專述改造世界的前途。）以及他的自傳「Stlobiography」（一九三四年出版，雖為自傳，並非專就本人着筆，韋氏稱此為自傳的試騐，——一八六六年以後一個庸人腦力的發見與決論。）作更透澈的暴露。</p>
<p>閃電智力</p>
<p>韋爾斯所以能受同時代人欽仰的原故，全賴其具有令人興奮引眾注意的才思。很少著作家能像他寫述如此許多問題，更少著作家能像他如此激動讀者。他並有幾為人莫及的能力，而使人覺得他所說者不但值得說，並且應該說。他對各事，雖乏真的懷疑，但他批評的本領，偉大驚人。她又能運用如閃電般的智力，燭照最隱暗的事情。他富於審斷力，對於任何要素，不言過其實，亦不輕估其值，他以偉大豪邁的筆調傾動人心，或使企望，或使恐懼，或使奮起，或使沮喪。他以大匠的按能使他們配合宇宙。他使世界上的件多人知他厭視他們的愚鈍，同時又能傳達他對世界的愛感，這大約是韋爾斯最大的成功。</p>
<p>韋爾斯是一位國際主義者。他覺得虛浮的國家在經濟上與政治上所發生的瑣碎爭執，實為往代世界中造成荒蕪的主要原因，也許在將來還會斷送世界的文明。他一生注力於世界聯邦的締造，而主張各國應犧牲其主權的一部分，但他不贊成以平民政治的學理達到這個目的。他的社會主義是科學的，生物學的，而非經濟的，政治的。他的政治思想自始一貫，堅主所願有的改革應由開明的少數人領導實行，其成功可易於出自大眾的智力，或大眾的健全　劃，所以他相信偉大事業組織的首腦與科學家技衛家。他覺這些人中含有他所倡世界革命的細胞，他們祇須依着程序，盡其良知，運用所已握有的一切，自可得到權力。一九二九年成立的韋爾斯會社，（H.　G.　Wells　　Society）即本此根據而成立。他認世界各民族必須團結合作，才能使人類在科學時代中得保安全。</p>
<p>韋爾斯與許多幻想著作家不同，他在社會生活與精神生活中同樣積極。一九三四年曾赴美國謁見罷斯福總統，後又赴莫斯科謁見史太林元帥。他見俄國的社會主義轉成獨裁制，頗為失望。此次世界大戰發生，粉碎他所抱的世界和平與進步的美夢，他的心緒，日見惡劣。他見科學的擢力不賦予有遠見的人們，以增進人類的智慧，却握在强覇的人們手中，製成破壞利器，如原子彈等，這在他一九一四年所出版的「The　Word　Set　Free」一書中已豫料及此，不意竟成事實。所以他在上年寫成了「Mind　at　the　End　of　Tether」，打銷以前所抱的許多樂觀，而在人類需要希望與勇氣時宣佈人類的否運。這是他歷來著作中最頹喪的一種。</p>
<p>總之，他的視力所及的範圍，他的博學所臻的程度，他的智力，應變無窮，他的好學，孜孜不倦，他的議論，鞭辟入裏，韋爾斯賴此種種，造成他的偉大。世人到了老年，少有能保持他們的維新傾向，與他們的常識，更少能像韋爾斯始終抱着「為人」主義。</p>
<p>評讚一斑</p>
<p>韋爾斯生前已受許多名人許讚，今錄數種如下：</p>
<p>白朗恩：「韋爾斯運思極速，因此往往不能靜止，以穩固他所佔得的地位。故他的社會主義雖推動不已，常放光明，但亦時常脫節。」</p>
<p>勃羅克斯：「韋爾斯是一位智者，而非藝術家。這是說：他自然的就理想方面，而非就經騐方面，抓住並解釋生活。」今</p>
<p>麥卡賽：「韋爾斯曾解除處在窄狹環境中的青年男女所受因襲式舊禮的可怕束縛，而代以更廣大的願望，與另一種尊敬，他的盡力，較任何人為巨。」</p>
<p>韋爾斯逝世後，蕭伯納所作的評論，當然尤為確當。他說：「韋爾斯不是一位紳士，（Gentleman）他不能且不願有此身份。他是花匠與司閽之子，故毫無階級。他的行為從不像紳士，也不像店夥，或學校的教員，但他曾度過這些生涯。他獨具風度，從不摹仿他人。他是何等的可慕！他性情溫和，雖怒視吾人全體，但吾人之中無一怨恨。猶憶距今約五十年前，我與韋爾斯因左翼法比安會社所行的政策發生爭論。我毫不費力使他完全失敗，但該會社的社員雖對他不投一票，却責我不應如此魯莽，並全對他表示同情。假使他一向是個極機警極自制的人物，他受人的愛敬，必不及今日的一半。」</p>
<h3>回漢禁婚訪新疆省委艾沙</h3>
<p>— 十六日蘭州航訊　張世豪</p>
<p>在這不安定的時局中，誰不關心着新疆的問題；尤其是在唇齒相關的甘肅。人的心目中。前天晚上，青年團甘肅支團部在本市抗建堂主辦的蘭州市第四次各界聯誼會中，記者在長官席上，發現了八九位彪形大漢，頭上戴着平頂八角的繡花小帽，為首一員大將，便是別來將近一年的老朋友——艾沙先生，這一喜可真了不起。</p>
<h3>入贊中樞貢獻殊多</h3>
<p>艾沙先生雖然是道地的同胞，但是，漢話却講得非常流利。他和麥斯武德先生在抗戰期中，始終是入贊中樞，坐鎮重慶；作新疆與中央間之大橋樑，為回族奔走，為國家效力，其功蹟有口皆碑，值得我們欽佩與讚揚。</p>
<p>和艾沙先生一同來的，除了他的公子外，還有五個新疆青年團的代表，和二位考察教育和戲劇的先生，一行九人，是前天飛到蘭州的，將去出席廬山第二次青年團全國代表大會。他們剛下飛機，在西北大廈休息不久，便趕來參加聯誼晚會，作了大會的上賓，宋幹事長特別致歡迎詞，介紹給來賓認識，寇書記親自出馬，擔任招待，嘉賓們正在欣賞藝術，記者不願去多打擾，略事寒喧後，便約定翌晨八時在西北大廈暢談。</p>
<h3>濫用權勢强迫通婚</h3>
<p>拜訪艾沙先生的時候到了，艾沙剛起床，正在洗臉，記者便和小艾沙聊起天來。他今年還不到十五歲，一向在重慶讀書，這次回家玩了些日子，現在要回校上學去，他很天真，活像艾沙先生人約不到五分鐘，記者便開始和這位健談的老將談起來，記者首先詢問最近轟動中外禁止回漢通婚事件的內幕。他很坦白的告訴記者說：本來回漢的婚姻問題，並不十分嚴重，但是近年來，情况一天一天的惡化，內地來新的軍民官吏，多用權勢壓迫新疆婦女，强行結婚，因此激起新疆民眾反惑，無論如何，新疆人寗死也不願自己的姊妹嫁給內地人，問題嚴重到這個地步，於是全省人民，堅決要求中央，禁止回漢通婚，前幾天，他們自動的展開了一個普遍性的運動，凡是在民國三十二年以後和內地人結婚的新疆女子，一齊被他們從內地人家裏拖出來，關在禮拜寺裏，聽候宗教上的處置。</p>
<h3>企業公司囤貨機構</h3>
<p>其次，談到新疆企業公司的解散，他認為企業公司完全是囤積居奇，襲斷市場，摧毀私人商業的一種機構，因此，新疆人民一致反對它的存在。</p>
<p>至於伊寗事件，幸賴張主席的遠大政策而獲解決，各地秩序與治安，現已恢復正常，不過人民生活，要比在抗戰時期苦的多。物價步步高漲，令人司怕，私人經營的事業，多瀕於破產的危急階段，這幾乎成了全國的普遍現象，不過新疆更顯得嚴重些。說到軍紀問題，他認為實在有嚴加整飭的必要</p>
<p>艾沙先生說到新疆人民的願望，他過激的站了起來。他認為內地人民需要什麼？新疆人民也需要什麼；美國人民需要什麼？新疆人民也需要什麼，新疆人民願意生活在新的新疆；老實說，像盛世才時代的新疆，他們不希望再度出現。新疆需要科學化的建設事業，普及的教育，人民安定的生活，保國衛民的軍隊，愛民如子的官吏，以及親同骨肉的內地好老百姓，在這樣的情形下，他敢保證新疆人民願意投入祖國的懷抱。</p>
<h3>努力建設代替宣傳</h3>
<p>至於張治中主席，新疆人民對於他的印象非常好，也同時像對救世主一樣的寄以無窮的希望，雖然對於他們理想中的要求，還沒有實現，他們也知道張主席主新的時間還不長，他的幹部是否能配合他的工作，雖不能十足肯定，但是無論如何；張主席是好主席，是蔣主席的真正代表，新疆人民，總相信張主席是能够辦好的，能够實現他們的願望的最後艾沙先生談到當此外蒙獨立，强隣環視之下，邊疆問題應該嚴密注視，政府不但要注重有形的國防建設，而且要加强建設無形的國防建設，以建設代替宣傳，新疆的先天條件很充足，無論如何，一切建設事業，總得要急起直追，否則新疆人民的向心力，將來恐會發生問題。</p>
<p>談的時間久了，艾沙先生要進早點，記者便趁此告辭了。</p>
<h3>台省雜拾</h3>
<p>— 十五日台北航訊特派員　江暮雲</p>
<p>台灣過去有二十萬日本人，他們中有十多萬遣送回國了，還有一部份技術人員留在這裏，準備十二月前分四批遣送回國。這批人走了，代之而來的內地人至多三萬，照例房屋是不會發生恐慌的，實際上却不然，從內地來的人，多數住不到房子，台灣也鬧屋慌，這似是笑話，但這是事實。陳長官說明因為住的不方便，使他們發生不良印象，他說：「與其派人到外省去宣傳，還不如使外來客方便些，使他們回去做義務宣傳員」！解決內地人的住，確是個問題。</p>
<p>胡椒似的硫安</p>
<p>本省的水稻·甘蔗都需要肥田粉，日本人稱硫安，又名硫酸錏，尤以水稻。與甘蔗硫安施肥的習慣性很大的。救濟分署從加拿大運來了三千噸，據錢分署長說，要是供給全省，等於撒胡椒末，經過專家們的決定，本期以八元一磅的低價售給嘉義以南各地區的農戶，以每甲施用一二五磅（五六公斤）為標準，可以分配四四、五三四、二甲，可能增收的稻穀在二萬噸。可是，錢署長說：以後何時來，來多少，都是問題。日本人的殖民地經濟政策是供給台灣硫安，但廠在熊本和大阪，台灣是沒有的。根機他的報告，要求在水稻之外再想配發蔗農，是不可能的事。</p>
<p>據農業家的估計，本省糧食生產，本年第一期因缺乏肥料，減產到常年的三分之一至五分之二，從前每公畝年產米約二百英斛，小麥七十五英斛，現在至多只能收穫六十六英斛的米和五十英斛的小麥。顯明的例子是過去有三尺五寸長的稻桿，現在短到二尺五寸，八寸的稻穗縮短到五寸了。</p>
<p>使用汽車上學</p>
<p>陳長官說：用公家汽車送孩子們入學，不是愛護，而是摧毀孩童，於是警局開始取締官員員們以汽車接送孩童上學。</p>
<p>因為溫泉區北投是一個好去處，用辦公用的汽車帶太太孩子們去玩，是普通的事，長官說這需要小心，因為過去日本官吏這樣是被人側目的。</p>
<p>台灣醫藥會况</p>
<p>擁有四十六年歷史的台灣醫藥會已於前月召開大會，決定改組為民間醫藥學工作者的集團，該為會本省醫藥研究總機構，網羅全省最優秀的醫師及醫學關係者三百餘人。決定每月開例會一次，每年開大會一次，作學術演講及發表研究成績之報告。該會理事二五人，公推杜聽明博士任理事長。據杜博士告：該會為全國唯一研究熱帶病學之國體出版雜誌共四四卷。最近除繼續刊行外，並已於本月二十日主辦鼠疫研究會，由堀內·丸山兩博士講述免疾病理，森下教授講述風子研究，青木教授講述鼠話等。該會至盼國內醫藥家交換研究，互相討論，會址設台灣大學醫學院內。</p>

<p>願獎勵節烈之士</p>
<p>編輯先生：勝利現在已經一年啦！在這過去一年里，漢奸是懲處了一部分，但仍有一部分逍遙法外。這一方面因為國人多數抱着各人自掃門前雪的傳統觀忽；另一方面因為檢犁漢奸須要提出證據，不干自己誰願意找麻煩。</p>
<p>致於獎勵氣節，直到現在還沒聽到，我現在提山「懲奸」與「獎節」，是二而一的問題，也是盛飭頹風的當前急務，所以提供管見，希望興論界和社會賢達及當局的注意。</p>
<p>我認為漢奸不論大小，都應付之法曹，執法者應權衡事實，作判刑的根據！殺人者死！蹂躪人權或索詐及發國難財者除判刑外，應沒收其全部財產。這沒收下來的逆產，除償還受害人之損失外，其餘應作恢復國家經濟或救濟基金；同時提出一部分帮助貧乏的節烈之士或其遺族。</p>
<p>我以為節烈之士是宇宙正氣所鐘，是國族的靈魂。領袖在抗戰前就倡導過氣節，我希望政府當局在懲辦漢奸聲中，同時對節烈的獎勵也要付諸實行。應組織特種調查委員會，一而調查，一面令各級政府及社會人士舉薦；或自薦。級調查確屬節烈者應派大員撫慰，並給予榮譽獎勵，務使生榮死哀，遺族得所，這也許是燕王市駿骨和築台延郭隗的遺意吧！</p>
<p>本來一個人好是應該的，壞則不應該，好不應受獎；壞絕對要懲罰。可是在這綱常廢弛，道義淪喪的現社會，節烈的義士比較少，為提倡固有道德計，是應該大大的渲染一下的。（劉桐）</p>
<p>為閩省歸僑呼籲</p>
<p>編者先生：閩省僑務處自二月初旬開始登記並請領出國護照，迄今己有六月餘矣，尚未開始遣送。竊我等於太平洋戰爭爆發期間，不願做敵人之順民，故棄財產，由敵鐵蹄之下逃山，一路蒙承政府救濟，得安抵故鄉。目今閩省生活昂高，謀生艱難，五年之中，資斧已盡，生活困頓不堪，未知何處才得安身？茲以誠懇意見，籲請海外部僑務委員會及行政院善後救濟總署等各機關主管長官，速即派船免費遣送，俾數萬僑胞，得重返原居留地，以振舊業。若不急為設法派船遣送，前途何堪設想！（葉國全謹上）</p>
<p>小券破票處置辦法</p>
<p>准八月十五日總讀字第一七五號合函，以准貴報讀者余克信君來函，對於破損小券收回事，有所陳述，檢附原函一件，希查照參考等由，經已洽悉，良深感荷。茲解釋如次：（一）各地小券，早經盡量收兌，兌入後，已不再發出：（二）破損鈔券，除託各地省行代兌外，並與郵匯局訂約，委託全國郵局代兌。相應函復，統請察洽為荷。此致申報社（中央銀行發行局啟）</p>
<p>麵包陣陣香房客性命危</p>
<p>我們是跑馬廳附近，起士林麵包店第二進房屋樓上的一羣房客，方寸之間，住下了二十餘人，在這褥暑蒸人，早已有「透不過氣來」的感慨。</p>
<p>那知樓下的起士林麵包店，竟是只顧自己賺錢，不顧他人性命，他們在樓下設工業性爐灶，製造麵包及生產各種麵製品終日裏爐火融融，滿室煤灰飛舞！反之，住在樓上的一羣人性命，在已經一百度左右的熱天，如置身洪爐，又宛如一批危亡的生命羣。</p>
<p>我們起了一陣疑慮，要是爐火偶一不慎，這二十餘人勢將為他們而犧牲，我們又擔憂着一點，就是幸而不生火災，這樣避免中暑或生病。</p>
<p>這是一種呼聲，希望消防當局的注意，要是能獲安全誠感激入肺腑。（二良）</p>
<p>為何有此陷馬坑</p>
<p>編輯先生：鄙人於夜間八時許，自南市丹鳳路福佑路訪友畢，擬經民國路北歸，不料行至福佑路東段將盡處，突然雙脚踏空，傾入路上一大窟窿中，足有半身之深，真跌得我莫明其妙！皮破血流，扶創忍痛，特草此文藉為質問：（一）馬路中既有如此大深坑，為何兩旁店舖住戶，不向主管當局報告？縱不為往來行人計，不當為自身安全耶？（二）如此大深坑，維持治安的警士先生，豈不曾覩及？（三）直接負責路政的當局，如為修築溝渠而施行工程，則綠何不攔以木架，告以危險？入晚當然應燃以紅燈，但今則均未之見，不禁令人發生疑問，「馬路中掘此陷馬坑所為何來」！（方春雷）</p>

<h3>第三次大戰如果發生　北美洲將成戰場　加拿大將領談美加聯防重要性</h3>
<p>— ——椿譯自星期六夜報——</p>
<p>要在這原子時代，防衛北美洲，就非得創立嶄新的國防觀念和技能不可。</p>
<p>這是誰的事？</p>
<p>不是加拿大，也不是美國單獨的事。要防衛北美洲，不單是美加的國防政策要配合，兩國的兵力，軍器，物資，佈防等等都要有一種全部的配合。</p>
<p>現存的美加聯防關係是在一九三九年產生的，那時雙方同意：在緊急的時候·互相援助。在這個原則下產生了永久聯防議會。可是它的任務完全是一稱評議性質的，沒有一點保衛的力量。道樣的聯防機構，如果繼續下去，只能產生一種「假安全」的虛想，對於實際是無補的。如果有人今大侵略北美洲，去抵抗他的不是一支聯合的軍力，而是兩個獨立的軍事單位，旣不能配合，又沒有互相可以交換的武器。</p>
<p>在方才結束的大戰中，美加曾很忽促地做了些防衛北美的工作。加拿大造了許多飛機塲。美國在加苔原上也搶建了一六七一哩長的阿拉斯加公路，來保護阿拉斯加和阿留西安，（Aenfiani）軍島。美國還造了油管，爲了替加拿大煉油。可是，今天，沒人用道條公路，而油管也銹了。去秋，在油井附近的基地滿堆着各種美軍齟備，因爲運費太貴的緣故。</p>
<p>然而這類倉猝的試騐至少也收到相當效果。日軍因此潰敗，軍隊和物資的運輸也得以通暢，至今有許多將佐，提起阿留西安之役。還要談虎色變。可是因爲軍事新聞檢查的關係，一般人都以爲它不過是一塲無關緊要的戲目。實際上，假使不是運氣好，北美洲也許會因此變成血腥腥的戰場，敵人也未嘗不可能侵入，設立飛機基地，而作轟炸美國工業中心的打算，或者敵人甚至於炸減加大熊湖的鈾　，而毀滅原子能的唯一國內來源，那可就嚴重了！</p>
<p>阿留西亞之役，還留下別的敎訓，可以供美加聯防的長官參考。雙方的配備旣不同，武器的口徑不同，所以一切供應制度等：都得有雙份，同時雙方因此不能互用一些重要物資。有時候，因爲運輸關係，會發生一種一方面配備不足而無力作戰一方而有餘的現象。</p>
<p>許多將領都一致認爲第三次大戰如果在五十年內發生，將以北美爲戰場、加海軍參謀總長瓊司上將，在他過世不久前發表的意見很可以代表一般將領他說：</p>
<p>「第二次世界大戰同盟國之所以獲勝利，是靠着美國工業非常的生產數量和速度。否則歐洲登陸，驅德軍出俄境都是不可能的事。所以，再有大戰，侵略國一定先向美工業中心如正資堡，底特律等等下手。而敵人多半是採用空襲的方式。在這個場合下加拿大的處境可以不言而喻了。</p>
<p>美加聯防關鍵</p>
<p>美加聯防問題的關　照加拿大一方面說，還在民意方面。道計劃能不能實現，要看人民怎樣看法。</p>
<p>一般認爲是「帝國主義」者的加民都反對聯防，斥爲是一種出賣國家的下策。第一次大戰留下的老爺們也不贊同，他們認爲這一下加拿大還成加拿大嗎！即使對他們說過去。和目前又何嘗不是如此，學大不列顚，作她的羽翼，他們也許會勉强同意，不過總會感到替美國人出力，又是一件事。</p>
<p>但是我曾拿還聯防問聯和國內各式各樣的人談過，他們的想法都非常顧到現實。每一位二次大戰的退伍兵將都毫不猶豫的擁護最密切的美加軍事一元化。只有在安剔厘阿省的中南部（在美革命時保皇黨移殖於此，至今居民仍保持親英態度）居民又猛烈反對聯防。</p>
<p>加拿大有三百五十萬法語公民。在兩次大戰中他們都反對參戰，反對自己的靑年去替英國送死。講到美加聯防，一位銀行經理很可以代表一般居民的意思：「我們知道我們獨手不能保衛我們的國土。我們許多人都不承認去打歐戰是最好的保國辦法。但是都覺得和美國聯防却是理所必然的。這個强有力的　國，和我們有共同的宗旨，就是向衛。」</p>
<p>要重新確定加拿大的國防政策，不是重新編排軍隊就可以究成的。加國的工業和美國的關係就分不開。大約工廠如福特，通用，威司丁好司，奇異等都是附屬在美國總公司的。雇用的行政和技術人員也是由總公司訓練而派來的。照如今的情形，如果英國參戰，這些工廠都得換到戰時生產，製造英國式的武器。</p>
<p>第二次大戰還不滿一年，我們就看得很淸楚，要經三千哩敵人控制日海洋來實施軍事配合是不可能的。尚英軍丹刻克敗退時，一部份船戰飛機引　在去加途中都被召回，結果加拿大的訓練　，機　機身都有了，可是沒有　　。又如在大西洋艦航中，有在加船塢中下水的軍　，沒有武襲的護航·因爲當時加拿大造的砲沒有，而　國造的大小又不舍用。在一九三九年美借加長程砲作防守海岸用·　來發現　砲彈也得送去，因爲加廠造的口徑不會。諸如此類的事，在一九四〇和一九四一兩年眞是多得不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>計劃實現不易</p>
<p>大戰將結束的時候，加工廠還在趕造英國式的機械。和平了，這些工廠立刻開始轉用美大量生產的方式製造美國出品·如果再有戰爭，他們又得再改變生產方法，對於效用方面損失可太大了。</p>
<p>加拿大的海陸空總參謀對於今後的國防問題都已看得很淸楚；他們知道傳統下來的舊辦法是不够應付新需要的。同時，加拿大的軍隊也盡力適合美國的標準，靜待美加兩政府有進一步的認識，有一個確定的政策。</p>
<p>目前，加海軍已經有和美海軍聯合操演的計劃。雙方的空軍也準備聯合演習。兩國還交換指導人員，希望可以因此互相多學習些。</p>
<p>但是英國製造的飛機仍將繼續爲加空軍的主力。槍彈的口徑還是沒有一個標準。加軍隊也還得一切跟英國的方式走。</p>
<p>加參謀總長福爾古斯中將說的最中肯：「假使我們要好好地做，最重要的問題就是求協調。每一件武器，如果雙方都有，它的口徑，一定要完全相同。所用的名稱也得完全一樣，譬如一師團」這個字，從人數和作戰力講，雙方就得有完全同樣的認識。」</p>
<p>如果大戰結束得晚些，美加旣是盟國，這個聯防計劃也許已經實現。如今，可就比較要困難得多，一般的人民都厭倦戰爭，對於將來的軍事問題很難有興趣。吃政治飯的人，當然不會爲了這間題而大聲疾呼。</p>
<p>照軍人看法，對於這些新武器如原子彈，最有效的抵禦辦法就是利用相似或更完備的新武器。且敵人襲擊紐約，芝加哥等大都市，馬上這方面就可以出動把侵略國的工業中心炸成平地。</p>
<p>這個塲合之下，很明顯的，要統盤計劃保衛北美洲，加拿大對美國的需要，和美國對加拿大的需要是一而二，二而一，絕對分不開的。</p>
<p>加拿大國防工業區火車正忙于運輸工作，工作緊張。</p>
<h3>飛翼　能力超出超級空中堡壘</h3>
<p>— 鋼人譯自大眾科學雜誌</p>
<p>帶着數量驚人的炸彈，航行過全球四分之一週，更能不着陸地回來，這便是最新製成，充實美國空軍的新式飛機—飛翼的性能。</p>
<p>所以名爲飛翼，就因牠有異於平常飛機的龐大的兩翼，其翼「尖」間距達一百七十二呎，滿載時重一百零四噸半，與共重六十五噸的B-29型超級堡壘相較，載重約增加一倍。</p>
<p>飛翼爲諾斯洛（Nortgrop）飛機工廠所設計及製造。用四具拍拉，華納引擎，總發出馬力達一千二百匹馬力，各引擎和漢密敦廠製「推進式」（Push—type）旋漿，旋漿亦特製，爲二個四翼旋漿，合於同軸，並有反向裝置，使在「飛翼」着地時，兩旋漿互相反方向旋轉，以减少「飛翼」在地上的「滑程」。</p>
<p>兩翼中有抗壓的房間，可容納十五人，管理員，電訊員等另有九個位置，還有三個槍手座，小室中並備有可變「椅床」。</p>
<p>停在地面上時，有二十呎高，全身載在五個輪子上，在裏面用直徑爲五呎六吋和四呎八吋的三壘齒輪控制動作，兩翼中部截面闊三十七呎半，漸向翼尖呈流錢型减縮。</p>
<p>祗直看這一架飛翼，我們從他的外表見到這樣的製造，在飛機工程上確已有了大大的革新。</p>
<p>事實吿訴我們，這是負責設計及製造的主管人們，研究了二十三年之久，費了幾百萬小時去作各種試騐和實騐試飛，更作工程學上的研討，約翰·諾斯洛的第一次正式實騐飛翼是在一九二三年舉行的，讓他知道了有努力研究的價値，乃作不斷的試騐和改良見「飛翼在成功中」一文，載一九四二年三月號（PopularScience），現在，這第一次試飛的N-1-M飛翼是被陳列在Wright　field的博物院中，任人參觀。</p>
<p>諾斯洛非但設法解決了龐大兩翼的各項問題並且取消了通常飛機的尾部，成爲這創新紀元的飛翼。升降機舵和方向舵，合併爲一個「升降方向器」。在控制方面，更在兩翼後部有奇怪的「百葉窗洞」，在慢速航行時，免除空氣的平滑流動，得到正常控制，高速時則能自動開閉，這些都足以增進牠的航空效率。</p>
<p>置備適當的槍座，使牠更具有强大的火力網，保障安全。下面便是牠和B-29型的比較表，更使我們覺得在航空上，「飛翼」顯明地是又進一步了！</p>

<h3>從英蘇關係看　土國海峽問題　不是蒙德婁公約的修正問題　而是英蘇兩國爭霸的表面化</h3>
<p>— 朱敬炘</p>
<p>蘇聯不依照蒙德婁海峽公的的規定，突然照會土耳其政府·要求蘇土兩國單獨進行談判、變更韃靻尼爾海峽在法理上的地位。使近東的風製頓時緊張起來。因爲國際情熱變遷，而要求修改國際條的，是一件極尋常且極合理的事情，太來用不着大驚小怪，過分重視的，但是蘇聯要求蘇土兩國共同防衛海峽地帶，由來已久，她企圖排斥英國勢力的野心，也是路人皆知的事實。因此蘇聯的要求一經提出，就引起各國的驚惶失色，使大家更加相信海峽問題，不是一個單純的問題，除了與蘇土兩國直接有關而外、還有極複雜微妙的國際冀景。英國在這决事件中，雖然愼重將事，並未首先有所主張，但是蘇聯此舉、却針對着英國而發，而且不肯放鬆一步。</p>
<p>據法國新聞社廿五日莫斯科電、蘇聯廣播電台竟發出英國在海峽地帶設立軍事根據地的消息，並謂英國已在那裏造有「電逹站」，密切注意潛水艇的行動，這一個電訊，不論確實與否，即足以證明英蘇在土耳其的對立，已到了白熱化的程度。所以海峽問題，不僅是一個法理的問題，而成爲英蘇在地中海上爭霸的外交戰了。</p>
<p>洛桑會議與蒙德婁條約</p>
<p>在第一次世界大戰期間，土耳其依附德國作戰，至大戰結束，疆土大失，君士但丁堡爲列强軍隊所佔據，希臘軍隊又侵入小亞細亞沿海岸之地。國民黨領袖凱末爾乘時堀起，土耳其帝國瓦解。新興的土耳其共和國，祗偏促於小亞細亞的一隅，幸而在凱末爾領導之下，幾度奮鬥，國內的政治·經濟·文化·建設各方面都得到相當的成就，同時又擊退希臘軍隊、奪回了伊士麥國境，推至巴爾幹半島，國際上的地位，也略增高。</p>
<p>土希戰爭之後，英法義日及巴爾幹半島諸國，在洛桑會議，一九二三年七月，簽訂洛桑條約，廢約凡爾賽和約條款，承認土耳其國土的恢復。至一九三六年，土耳共照會洛桑條約簽字各國，要求修訂關於　　尼爾海峽撤廢軍備及自由通航之條款，是以英·法·日俄·南斯拉夫·羅馬尼亞·保加利亞·希臘及土耳其在蒙特里城舉行會議，由土耳其外長魯斯第提出新公的草案，結果另簽新約，以替代　日之洛桑條約，土耳其逐得重整海峽軍備。</p>
<p>二次大戰中土耳其動態</p>
<p>當第二次世界大戰開始的時候，凡在第一次大戰中依附德國的盟國，祗有土耳其沒有再度依附她。尤其是簽訂英土協定，給聯合國家以莫大的收　。這時的外交部長、就是現任總統伊諾努，他的政策是親英美的。一九三八年，凱末爾逝世之後、他就繼任爲總統，仍維持他的一貫政策。在一九四一年初，納粹切斷了英國在近東的油源供給，封鎖了蘇　士運河，又在伊拉克扶植了親軸心的政權。維琪政府復指揮法軍在叙利亞作戰，社德喀尼斯羣島是義大利的空軍基地，這時，土耳其已陷於軸心國包圍之中，納粹向她提出了假迪前往中東的要求，土耳其並不屈服，毅然拒絕。一而又動員全國軍隊，以備萬一，德國對之，也無可奈何。</p>
<p>二次大戰後蘇土的關係</p>
<p>蘇土兩國歷史上的關係，素來不睦。土耳其在第二次世界大戰中，雖保持了相當時間的中立，並在德國投降三個月前，亦曾對德宣戰，但從蘇聯看來，土耳其和德國的關係，總嫌太密切些，去年三月間，蘇聯通吿土耳其，廢止一九二五年所簽訂的蘇土友好條約。</p>
<p>戰爭結束以後，土耳其的外交局勢，仍很緊張，蘇土友好條約的廢止，在蘇聯的立塲上看來，認爲在目前時勢大變，此項條約，需加修正。在土耳其方面，亦希望與蘇修好。蘇聯大使乃與土外長於去年六月問會議，蘇聯政府提出另訂新約的三項先決條件：（一）一九二一年割讓與土耳其的喀斯和阿達漢應歸還蘇聯。（二）允許蘇聯在黑海海峽設立基地，讓蘇聯參與海峽的防務。（三）修改蒙德婁協定。這樣的談判，當然是無法進行。十二月問，蘇土邊疆，情形一度十分緊張，土耳其民衆亦舉行示威行動。但土外長所發表的，在「不求不予」的情形下，極願與蘇修好。今年三月，舊事重提，蘇聯通知土耳其，在喀斯和阿達漢兩地與達靻尼爾海峽問題未解決之前，不能簽訂任何同盟條約。</p>
<p>蘇聯的要求·土耳其不能輕易允許，領土完整，必須保持，達靻尼爾海峽，更不是土耳其單獨所能決定。在第二次大戰時，黑海中德德潛艇十分活躙、保加利亞和羅馬尼亞的上空，也充滿着飛機，以致蘇艦不能通過海峽，這是土耳其駁覆蘇聯的理由，終於把這件事情延擱下來。</p>
<p>突然其來的蘇聯提要求</p>
<p>八月八日，蘇聯向土耳其提出備忘錄一件，要求修改蒙德婁條約，認爲達靼尼爾海峽之行政權，應置於黑海各國管理之下，由蘇土兩國共問負責担任海峽的防衛工作。蘇聯外交部又公佈：從德國外交部檔案庫中，抄獲文件兩宗，第一宗爲一九三七年至一九四三年間，德國對匃政策。第二宗爲一九四一年至一九四三年間，德國對土耳其政策。在關於土耳其的一宗中，發現土假中立之名，實行援助德國，包藏禍胎，與蘇聯爲敵。蘇聯幸而勝利，得將土耳其之陰謀打消，故蘇聯要求修改蒙德婁條約，即以此爲藉口。</p>
<p>土耳其接到蘇聯的照會後，政界人士咸認爲不可接受，各報均指出此嚴重之局勢，內閣　夜集議，以謀應付，拒絕要求，堅持達靻尼爾海峽之管轄，應由蒙德婁條約之機構決定之。所稱土耳其於戰時遠反公約之一節，亦予以駁斥，且表示不能與少數國家簽訂新協定，以代替一九三六年之公約。士國政府將繼續遵守公約，認爲管制海峽唯一的外交文件，不容違背。</p>
<p>各方面注視列強的態度</p>
<p>關於達靻尼爾海峽問題，決不是蘇土兩國間之事，黑海沿岸諸國，都直接和海峽發生關係。蒙德婁公約簽字的國家，也不會置身事外。如因修正蒙德婁條約而召開國際會議，日本·羅馬尼亞，和保加利亞因曾在軸心國方面作戰，恐無出席機會，美國勢必參加，如此，則蘇聯難免不和西方各國引起外交衝突。故此事不能由蘇土兩國進行談判。蘇聯主張由黑海沿岸各國共同解決，所謂黑海沿岸各國爲：羅馬尼亞與保加利亞。但羅，保兩國現在已不啻為蘇聯之附庸。　然要摒棄非黑海沿岸的蒙德婁公約簽字國，使土耳其單獨來應付這問題</p>
<p>土耳其自接得蘇聯的要求後，曾與西方各國密切磋商。英美兩國駐土大使與土外長接洽頻繁，法駐土大使亦會訪土外長商談，可見各國對這事的注意。據說在波茨坦會議中，關於蒙德婁公約應重予考慮一節，曾獲協議。但英美決不會贊同蘇聯目前的做法，故於十四日，十五日先後發表聲明，不能接受。認為蘇聯要求與土國共同防禦此重要水道，等於要求在土國取得軍事根據地，其行動似在恢復十九世紀式之外交。</p>
<p>英國擁護土耳其反對蘇聯海峽的要求，但鑒於蘇　士運河所處之近似情形，主張一種折衷方案，以滿足蘇聯之安全要求，即把他加入聯合國控制海峽通路之委員會。美國務卿貝爾納斯宣稱：蘇聯船艦可無限制通過海峽，但反對在海峽中取得基地。蘇聯眞理報社論則謂：蘇聯此舉爲保全黑海諸國之意大利益，非黑海國家應即停止千涉海峽行政，蘇聯在黑海擁有最長之海岸綫，對於禁止非黑海國之海軍侵入，當然有最大的自衛權。</p>

<p>— 劉倚思　趙景深</p>
<p>南非洲的女作家須萊納爾最著名，我國張近芬女土會譯過她的短篇小說集「夢」。但還有一位不曾介紹到中國來的女作家劉倚思（Etlielreda　Lewis），她在英美等國都很出名。報載效八月二日死於南非阿頭弗萊特港。</p>
<p>她生於一八七六年，一直住在南非洲，以一本小說「何恩傳」（Trarler　Horn）著名。何恩的眞姓名是史密絲（Alfred　A，smith）。劉倚思的本籍是英國的克州，原是體育敎師，嫁給南非的文官。生產了第一個孩子以後，就寫詩歌。</p>
<p>她不是寫實主義者，而是屬於想像和詩意一方面的。她的小說「豎琴」（The　Harp，　1925）出版的時候，她已是一個中年婦人，而灶的兒子也已經長大成人了。豎琴可說是詩人的小說，結構鬆散，情感熱烈。這本書是討論人種問題的，不過是詩人的理想主義，而不是寫實主義。南非的風景用活潑可愛的想像寫了出來，吏以北方寒冷的城市，如紐克州的邊岸和斯干底那維亞，來與酷熱的南非作爲對照。</p>
<p>在豎琴以後，劉倚思又寫了兩本羅曼司：「飄搖的翡翠」（The　Flying　Emerald　1925）和「螳瑯」（Mantis，　1926）。她稱那兩本書爲餬口作品，的確使豎琴的讚美者很是失望。</p>
<p>她在南非報紙寫報紙文學和短篇小說的時候，遇見流浪漢何恩（AlfredAloysius　Horn）和傑克（Zambesi　Jack）跋涉到約翰堡的小花園裏來，以家用鐵器求售。傑克就談起他所知道的故事。劉倚思就拿筆記簿記了下來，寫成「早年的象牙海岸」（The　Ivory　Coast　in　the　Earies）「非洲的河水」（The　Waterso　of　Africa）等書，這幾本書在大西洋的兩岸都賣買得很好。</p>
<p>她又根據何恩的話寫成有名的「故知」或「何恩的一生及其作品」（An　Old　Vister，or　The　Lifeand　Works　of　Aloysius　Horn,　1927），美國版改題「何恩傳」一九三〇年米高梅公司攝成電影，名爲「人獸奇觀」。</p>
<p>她又寫了「少年海盜」（The　Young　Vikings，1928）。她的小說都是以蠻荒的異國情調爲特色的。</p>
<h3>空虛　（小說）</h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>雨小些了，風還在吹。呼呼大風擊打在窗子上，窗子老是格輪輪地響，響得他心煩意躁。</p>
<p>他自己也奇怪，近來爲什麼道樣怕風？諒是老了，怕風吹壞身體，那眞笑話，還是二十七歲的壯年，如何能說老？是房子單薄，怕被風吹倒下來壓死他，那更笑話，他住的是學校裏去年新建的敎員宿舍，怎麼會倒？即使倒，他亦决不是個貪財惜命的庸夫！那末是多愁善感，看見了風，就要激起什麼回憶，或傷感吧？這亦許有點兒對了，不過他自己不見得願意承認。</p>
<p>他常常吿訴學生說，「你們要盡力在實際中追尋學問。實際！只有實際是可貴的，偉大的！」不錯，他是個絕對的實際主義者。他否認一切虛無飄渺的幻想，他小視種種空洞的靈感之類的東西。他在讀書的時候，最討厭那些坐在茜粉窗下吟詩作詞的同學。當了先生，又最恨幾個自命高雅，唉聲嘆氣，借酒澆愁的國文敎師。「文學是最最虛偽的，最最不實際的！」他非但這樣想，有時甚至感到科學都帶點虛茫，囚爲科學太深奧，也近於無中生有，也有些不容易捉摸。當然一半是性之所近，但一牛確乎是自己選擇的，他選擇了史地學。數年來他把全副精神貫注在這最最實際的學問中。他不斷地在實際中追尋，究討，正像他所勉勵於學生的。</p>
<p>然而最近·他竟碰到了這麽一會事？</p>
<p>他在這裏教過二學期書，他熟悉了所有的男女同事。他是實際的，他所熟悉的便也偏於實際。如果有人問他李校長是怎麼樣的一個人？他立刻閃閃眼睛回答：「老李嗎？尖臉孔，小眼睛，皮色黃黃的，聲音帶些啞，手裏常常抱着那五歲無娘的女兒。」當然，他所熟悉於李校長的，决不止於這一點外表；不過他不喜歡用看不見摸不着不實際的言詞來形容老李或任何人。同樣，他熟悉敎體育的沈長子有一個令人觸目的電桿木身材，敎幼稚園的密司查有二塊糾紅的顋頰；敎音樂的老周頭髮總倒掛在額角上，鬍髭天天有半分長……總之，差不多每一個同事留給他的印象都是實際的，具體的，正像他在萬國通史上看見的奧國第一任皇帝的照片一樣實在具體。</p>
<p>只是，有一位女同事給他的印象，似乎有些稍稍例外：</p>
<p>自然他叫得出她的名字，是個美麗又實際的名字——梅葉。他也像熟悉其他同事一樣的熟悉她：那麽一副中等身材，略有些胖，臉孔長長的，眼睛很小，但小得並不討厭，頭　燙過，額角上掛着幾個卷卷兒，胸部很發遠，走路時老低着頭，似乎在欣賞自己兩堆高聳在胸前微微顫動的乳峯，………………</p>
<p>「她可愛嗎？」初次見到她時，有一個年輕男同事輕輕問過他。</p>
<p>「噯，沒有意思！」他旋過了頭。</p>
<p>「呸！別假正經！難道你一世不娶女人？」</p>
<p>他淡淡一笑，不回答，就走開了。可不是叫他如何能回答？他是研究史地的，他讀過許許多多古代英雄偉人的失敗，失敗於一樣東西—女人！無數美好江山的斷送，斷送於一樣東西—女人—女人是可怕的，女人自古以來就是禍水，他深深地知道深深地戒備着。不過那不是說他一世不想娶女人了，這是說：他不愿意像別人一樣，先在空巾建造許多美麗的戀愛模欄，結果却什麽都抓不到。他預備再過一二年，看中一個最合適的姑娘，立刻娶了她做妻子，叫她管家，叫她生男育女，實實惠惠，一　不盧空　一初認識的女同事，碰見時至多平淡地點點頭，就完了。梅　也不例外。</p>
<p>但有那麽一個暖和的下午，太陽光照在操塲裏，熱烘烘，把地上的黃沙晒得發了燥，隨風飛颶起來，飛在空中，像一樓黃色的烟，悠悠地飄着　着。他低下頭在這個操塲裏匆匆的走，他腋下挾着一本很厚的書（當然是史地方而的書），　心中在想着一個問題（當然是史地方面的問題），因此，他並未留意對面有人在走過來，亦並未留意前而有一串輕脆的笑聲在響着。</p>
<p>「俞先生！兪先生！」</p>
<p>終於他被一聲淸晰的笑喊驚醒了。仰起頭，他看見二個女同事站定在他而前，一個是五年級級任陸佩華，一個是梅葉。他聽人說過她們兩人是好朋友。</p>
<p>「唔唔…密司陸密司梅…」</p>
<p>淡淡地點點頭，招呼一聲，他預備像平時一樣完結了可以走。但那兩位女同事站在他前面不動，却笑嘻嘻的望着他，似乎有話要說。</p>
<p>「兪先生，你不認識我們嗎？我們倒認識你，你和我們兩人同過學呢！」果然，陸佩華開了口。</p>
<p>他一怔，「喔，我可忘了。你們是那裏和我同學的！」</p>
<p>「在第三中學。那時候我們是新生，你是老生。你忘記了，我們還很記得，好像那時你已戴了眼鏡，常常穿一件灰色中山裝……」陸佩華說到這裏，側了頭，把梅葉推推，笑着問：「阿梅，你不是說還記得兪先生在一次元旦同樂會中扮演過一個老頭子……？」</p>
<p>「……」梅葉不回答，却把小小的眼睛抬起來向他一瞥，立刻羞澀澀地低下了頭。</p>
<p>她們走了，他也走了。所謂「例外」就從這時候開始了。</p>
<p>照理這「例外」是應該屬於陸佩華的，因爲她向他笑，她向他講話，以後每次看見他，總和他說長說短的說個不完，然而不！陸佩華給他的印象很平淡，普通，與其他男女同學給他的印象毫無兩樣。唯有梅葉，雖然不大同他講話，不向他笑，每次看見他僅向他迅速地一瞥，便把頭低了，但那「一瞥」，實在太不贅通，太不平淡了！他莫名其妙地感到，那一瞥所留給他的印象，竟有些超乎實際，有些奇妙，有些不能言說的况味存在裏頭。………</p>
<p>他熟讀過中外各國的歷史，可是歷史中缺少羅曼諦克的故事，因此，他做夢都想不到在「例外」中還有：更例外的事會臨到他。有一天陸佩華獨自到他辦公室裏來找他，輕輕的向他道：</p>
<p>「兪先生，梅葉愛你，她願意和你做個朋友！」</p>
<p>「別開玩笑，密司陸！」他笑了起來。</p>
<p>「誰同你開玩笑？眞的呢！她叫我來對你說，問：你願意不願意？」</p>
<p>對陸佩華認眞的臉孔看看，他不再奇怪，也不敢再笑。他記起這是二十世紀的新世界，新世界裏的一切，當然不能與歷史上的情形相比。不錯的，男女平等，男人可向女人求愛，女人爲什麼不能向男人求愛呢？什麼「女性的尊嚴」，什麽「處女的神聖」，都應該打破了，都應該廢除了！</p>
<p>自從這「例外」中的「例外」，事件發生後，他曾省出一部份研究史地學的時間來考慮過這個問題：他是實際的，當然他的考慮，決不止於一個空洞的「愛」字，他曾仔細地想過：照年齡，他確乎可以成家了。不過他知道自己並不富有，娶的妻子，總得能不愛虛榮，溫柔耐苦，才可有一個美滿快樂的家庭。現在梅葉旣有意思，那麽不妨先和她做做朋友，觀察觀察她也好。</p>
<p>春天的傍晚，校園子雖是小小的，却也有着一　嫩綠的靑草，開着幾朶紅白黃的小花。夕陽已經沉下去，麻雀在鄰家屋脊上唧唧的叫。梅葉和陸佩華並有在前，他悄悄地隨在後面，從敎職員辦公室裏走出來，跨上校園旁的水門汀走廊，四面沒有人，陸佩華故意把脚步加快，先匆匆往外走了，剩下他和梅葉二人留在園子裏。</p>
<p>夜幕漸漸落下來，黃昏的第一顆小星出現在天邊，外面街燈的亮光亦射進來了。他靜立在一顆臘梅樹下凝視着她：淡弱的星光燈光下，她的血紅的嘴唇，鬈卷的頭髮，高聳的胸脯，似乎顯得更美麗，神秘，誘人。……她終於忘記了再三考慮着的問題，忘記了和梅葉做朋友的目的，他屈伏在眼前一些處空的實際裏：水汪汪的眼，紅的唇，微微顫動的胸脯。——他像喝過酒一樣醉了，昏迷了！……</p>
<p>好像是她先發覺後面有人來了，向他道：「有人來了，我們走吧，明天再談。」</p>
<p>他沒有回答，只沉迷的呆看着她，依戀地送她到校門口，凝望着她的背影消失在薄薄的夜霧中後，不住的向自己道：「她是可愛的，我一定要她！一定要她！」</p>
<p>二十世紀的新世界裏發明了無錢電，人們的耳朵亦像無綫電一樣敏捷起來，消息很快就傳遍全校，陸佩華「紅娘」的綽號，也無人不知了。</p>
<p>「喂，老兪，慢點走，「紅娘」又給你帶信來了！」</p>
<p>「老兪，怎麼還不請我們吃蜜糕？快來一節特別快車呀！」</p>
<p>同事們的打趣，調笑，差不多成了家常便飯，起先他未免稍覺厭煩，但漸漸地，非但不厭煩，竟感到無上的歡欣，無上的先榮。每次人家跟他打趣時，他總張開嘴巴微微的笑—從心窩裏發出的笑！</p>
<p>他承認自己完全被她屈伏了。他一刻不能離開她，就是多看一下她映在地下的影子都好，他沒有心思再作什麽考慮，正像世界大事般：大局已定了？正在那時，學校裏有一個自然敎師請了長假，李校長問着每位敎員有無相當的代踝先生可介紹，問到他時；他忽然想起最近有一個同學託他謀過事。就想把那同學紹介給了李校長。</p>
<p>他把代課先生鈕長慶介紹給每位同事的那個早晨，白雲在天空裏輕輕的移，陽光是柔和的從一排長長的玻璃窗上射進辦公室來，照着鈕長慶高偉的身材，筆挺的西裝，和一雙活潑而充滿熱情的大眼睛。</p>
<p>他完全沒有想到自己站在鈕長慶面前，忽然顯得非常蒼老呆板，他更沒有想到女人的情感，有時能比大風中的楊柳條更脆軟飄弱。他用平常的語氣介紹完其他的同事，走到梅葉身邊，不平常地向鈕長慶笑道：「這位梅葉小姐，你早知道…不必介紹了吧？……」</p>
<p>梅葉和鈕常慶相對一笑，他以爲是自己不平常的笑容傳染了人，所以並未十分注意。等他開始注意的時候，事情已進行到驚人的地步了。</p>
<p>在回憶中也許能平淡地付之一笑！但當時確有些難以忍受。他怔怔地望住了睦佩華尖尖的瓜子臉，有二分鐘不動！不笑，也不呼吸，最後他張開開瓣抖動的嘴唇，吃力地問了一聲：</p>
<p>「毫無挽回的餘地了嗎？」</p>
<p>」我想無從挽回了！」陸佩華冷冷的望着他，帶一點憐憫：「她旣叫你死心，你就死了心吧！反正開始的時候，你亦不過是被動的！」</p>
<p>一聽這話·他彷彿從一場昏夢中情醒過來了。「被動的」，不錯，是她先來追求他，先來問他求愛：如今，見了鈕長慶，又把他丟了。嘿，這種無恥的女人！下賤的女人！沒有意思，絕交就絕交！</p>
<p>他不再向陸佩華看一眼（迎她都使他厭惡了），直挺挺立起身來往外邊走去。那天正是星期日，屋子裏靜悄悄，屋子外也靜悄悄。凄黃的太陽掛在灰沉沉的高空裏，好像要下大雨。他在外面走廊裏轉一個灣，走進淸靜的圖書室，在裏面幾架高大的書櫉前坐定了。</p>
<p>捧起一本厚硬的「史地百科全書」、他恢復了原來的自己—學問與實際的追求者！</p>
<p>一字一字看下去，一字一字在摘記本上小心地寫；四週很平靜，他的心也平靜。然而忽然有一個尖細的聲音像刺一樣直刺進他的耳朵，那是梅葉慣長的做出來的嬌笑</p>
<p>「嗯，我們到那邊去，那邊好！」</p>
<p>「那邊靠不住！說不定那書毒頭正在圖書室裏，被他瞧見了如何辦？」是鈕長慶抑低着的聲音。</p>
<p>「　！看見了也不怕，偏做給他看看，他能拿我們怎樣？」</p>
<p>他疑心外面已經下了雨，天已突然暗下來，一剎時書上的字全模糊起來。他拚命掙大了眼睛想繼續寫下些綱要，但猛然間發覺自己在摘記本上寫下的竟是許多「無恥」「女人」「禍水」等等亂七八糟的字眼。</p>
<p>他似乎沒有法子坐下去了，丟下手裏的筆跑出圖書室，原來外面並未下雨，却是一陣陣呼哦啦呼啦啦的大風發狂地在空中飄刮。他閉着眼睛奔過小小的校園子時風聲裘又飛來了一聲梅葉的尖笑：「嘻嘻嘻！以後偏做給那書毒頭看看，看他怎麽樣？」</p>
<p>就是這麽，一會事，發生於兩個月前，他是實際的，他用冷靜的「一笑」結束了那事，忘記了那事，然而不知怎的從那時候起，他忽然怕了風。</p>
<p>現在雨停止了，風還在吹。呼呼大風擊打在窗子上，窗子老是格輸輪地響。他坐在房裏，悶悶的思想，他不承認風激起了他的回憶，他的感傷。可是他煩燥，他看不進書，他沒有方法解脫一種莫名其妙的懊惱，……</p>
<p>漸漸地他聽見樓下一片嘻嘻哈哈的笑聲，他知道是幾位男同事在樓下辦公室裏談天，便無聊地拉起一張紙片，在上面寫了一行字：</p>
<p>「這麼大風，我煩燥透了，有誰能用幾句話，開解我的煩燥，決以一盒原封的「哈德門」香烟爲贈！」</p>
<p>他喊一個茶房把這字條送到樓下。一會兒，茶房笑嘻嘻的回上來，，手裏換了另外三張字條，他把字條接過來一一讀着。</p>
<p>「色即是空，空即是色，」是一個研究佛經的老同事的筆跡</p>
<p>「傳道者說：虛空的虛空，虛空的虛空，凡事都是虛空！」是一個信仰基督敎的靑年同事所寫。</p>
<p>他搖搖頭，把看過的兩張字條用力一搏，拋入廢紙簍子。展開第三張大的字條時，上面有幾行淸秀的墨筆字，一看他就認出是平素自己最討厭的國文敎員王倚萍的字。</p>
<p>「朋友！你怕風嗎？然而風是虛渺的。你聽見他的聲音，却不知牠從何處來？從何處去？你厭惡牠，却永遠不能將牠抓握，永遠不能將牠消減！好！這就象黴了人生的種種煩惱了，——看不見，說不出，永不能抓握，永不能消減！……</p>
<p>朋友！你希望能解脫一些煩情嗎？我勸你和我來喝杯白乾，唱幾聲「大江東去：」……</p>
<p>看到這裏，他禁不住微微一笑，抓起桌上一盒「哈德門」交給茶房道：</p>
<p>「拿下去給王先生，吿訴他我等一會就來！」</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風16</p>
<p>鑽進了車廂，就掏出一張名片，　了過來：</p>
<p>「特務專員的大　回到總部，千萬不要忘了小人·將來小人能够晉升，一定不會不感激您的恩典的」。</p>
<p>鬧了這半天花樣，這才明白他搗的什麽鬼。</p>
<p>車子跑得相當快，也頗　得十分利害，每次羅過哨兵崗位，倒是承這傢伙的情，說明他的番號身份，再加上「緊急公幹」，就過去了。</p>
<p>誰知走了不到三十分鐘，兩方軍隊，忽地正式接觸起來，先　祇晨疏落的步槍和輕機搶·一會兒霞天的大砲也參加了·我們雖然不在火線之內，却也隔着不大太遠。幾次車子都被哨兵　住，這傢伙扛起我的總部公事名義，勉强前進，有時平着火線，有時往斜刺裏走着。</p>
<p>「祇要能走，總是好的」；我心下忖着·</p>
<p>誰知車子愈前，雙方射擊　密，最後發現了很多傷兵卡車，我們也被肯定的阻住，絕對不許再進一步。「猪　」到了道時候，使出了全身的解散，求情，吿饒，恐嚇，威脅，却是亳無效騐。從巡哨小隊的口裏，我們知道这裏距離跑馬塲只有二三公里，而且差不多是全綫開火；或是說，幾個方面都在開火。</p>
<p>正在進退踟躕的當口，戰地憲兵巡哨隊也來了。我們關上也有砲火飛過。</p>
<p>「必須立即退回原防，或是轉到豐台！」憲兵哨似呼命令着；「車內和車頭的燈，不能關閉，省得有意外！」</p>
<p>「我們退回罷！」「猪　」徵求我的意見，我如此答應着。</p>
<p>車子回頭，走了不到一里，我記得是沿路比較最僻靜的一個所在，　　　　　點小嚴林和土山·我覺得，縱使我們沒有特殊使命，退回也是不可能的事；因爲戰塲的履進　退，是瞬息萬變的，誰也料不定後一分鐘的事；便對猪　命令式的說：</p>
<p>「停車罷！」</p>
<p>他這一回却是坐在駕駛員的身邊的。我們彼此備着車頂的燈光，都應得很淸楚</p>
<p>車　停了，可是就在這一剎那間，駕駛員和那位酒已嚇　了的　　，問頭要問我停車用意的時候，被他們　見我手附着手槍盒卞，對小老虎示意的樣子·其實這也是多此一舉，小老虎在我吩咐停車的當口，早已明白一切。</p>
<p>兩個傢伙同時下了車，想是他們動了疑心了。在這種特殊情形之下，友和敵祗是一　眼的勾當。兩個傢伙已經在戒備的狀態中了，但還不敢放肆。</p>
<p>「特務專員有什麽命令呢？」猪　走近車門問。我看見他那兩粒可厭的金牙。</p>
<p>「我們今天非速到城裏不可，但情形如此之壞，不得不冒險了；」我表示了決心。</p>
<h3>雄奇與精緻</h3>
<p>— 高甜心</p>
<p>大印（一寸外）刻得雄奇，方有氣魄；小印（兩分）則須精緻，方耐人尋味。大印如刻得無氣魄，即不能奪目，無精神。小印如刻得不精，則感粗野，無味。以大刀闊斧來刻小印，終不及小刀細心刻小印爲美。反之，如以小刀刻大印，亦屬大忌。蓋此兩種妙境，（刻大印與刻小印）皆非易事。惟性情相近之人能之。</p>
<p>平情而論，大印可以充分表現刻印之藝術趣味，可以充分發揮刀法·筆法·章法·篆法之美。一目瞭然。晶晶紙上，殊使人眼明，使人心曠神怡。小印因其體小，除感玲瓏精緻而外，其於刀法。筆法。章法·篆法，實有英雄無用武地之感。</p>

<h3>軍車</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>請駐滬各軍事機關注意</p>
<p>上海有許許多多汽軍肇禍事件，在統計數字中，也許軍用車所佔的數字並不大，但由於軍用車或因任務關係駛行過快，或因車身形式特殊，或因肇禍情况的不通常，以致軍車成爲交通肇禍事件中最大的目標，爲軍事機關的令　着　，　該特別予以管理。</p>
<p>我們知道有許多事情非主管人事前所明白，甚至事後也還不知道。</p>
<p>市區交通秩序，需要各方面來協助維持遵守，公衆生活是不應該有特殊階級可以例外的。這裏，我們請求美軍駐滬當局能與我們介作，對於駕駛人的技術·以及生活管理，必須嚴格，對於市政當局所頒佈的交通規章，必須查成切實遵行。</p>
<p>上海是個都市，不是戰區，在鄉村公路上可以風馳電掣，横衝直撞。在市區行人　比的道路上，那簡直在存心殺人！</p>
<h3>我推銷　國貸代價券</h3>
<p>— 在正</p>
<p>一位女學生的報吿</p>
<p>這次國貨代似券的推銷，我們高中部五個女生，成立一組，數目是一百萬。我因爲身體不大好，平素愛靜而不愛動，又沒應對的口才，所以四位同學，特別原諒，只給我十萬元的代價券。可是我拿到這十萬元的代價券，已心事重重。</p>
<p>回到家中，忙同父親商量。父親說：「明天，我介紹幾個老朋友給你，推銷起來，比較有把握一點。」</p>
<p>這時，剛巧有位毛先生，是在××電氣公司常會計的。他自吿奮勇地對我說：「你明天可以到我們公司裏來，至少二萬元。」</p>
<p>父親道：「那好極了，先到毛先生那裏，從×××路過東，到××路××保險公司楊先生的地方，他是個靑年財主，又是我的老朋友，至少可以推銷五萬元。」</p>
<p>這是前天傍晚的話，昨天早上，天氣雖然非常熱，身體雖然不大好，從海寧路走到×××路的毛先生處，毛先生很客氣，他在我手中，揀了二千元的代價券兩張，就給我四千元。我說：「昨天你不是答應我二萬元嗎·」</p>
<p>他說：「馬馬虎虎吧，這裘來捐錢的非常多，我如果多給你一點，是要使我爲雖的。」</p>
<p>他不過一個會計，他不能慷公同之慨，我自然不便要求他實行昨天的諾言。</p>
<p>向東走至楊先生處，待我說明來意，不料神色突變。他說：「這種事情，爲什麼要尋到我這裏來呢？」</p>
<p>我說：「認識的地方不推銷，不認識的地方更難推銷了！」</p>
<p>他十分肉痛地給我五千元，看他比受到什麽急病還難過，就不說什麽，給他五千元的代價券。他看了一看，仍要還給我，我說：「不要客氣，再會吧！」</p>
<p>回到家中，已是十二時半，又氣又疲乏又熱，却不覺得餓。</p>
<p>傍晚，隔壁的魏師母，到我家來閒談。她說：「這幾天，我買了許多柬西，玻璃皮夾，玻璃皮鞋……等。」</p>
<p>我想，這是個好機會，馬上說道：「這是洋貨，請你再買一點國貨好不好？」</p>
<p>「好，」她滿口答應道：「我上月借出二百萬元，利息二角算，昨天正好收到了五十萬元利息。」</p>
<p>於是我把推銷國貨代價券的意義，對她說明。她道：「好的，我來買五萬元吧。」</p>
<p>我歡喜極了，我想這樣一來，相差有限了。當她去的時候，我忙把五萬元的　價券，放在她手裏。</p>
<p>她說：「明天上午，我把五萬元送過來吧。」我說：「不必，明天上午九點鐘，我會來取的，因爲下午就要交款了。」　母親悄悄地對我說：「你不要太樂觀，這個女人，人家叫他十三點呢！」</p>
<p>今天上午，我到她府上，她這：「你下午來吧。吃過中飯，我給你預備好。」她說時，正在數着鈔票，至少有幾十萬元。</p>
<p>吃過中飯再去，她忽而說：「這代價券，不是要等到九月一日才適用嗎？」</p>
<p>「這個不行，」她說：「那我要吃虧四五天的利息了，不上算的。」</p>
<p>我說：「不是這麼說的，發行國貨代價券的意義，不是我也對你講過了嗎？」</p>
<p>「我忘記了，那你到八月三十一日的傍晚再來拿吧？」</p>
<p>「這是來不及的，」我不耐煩了：</p>
<p>「來不及你把代價券帶去吧，我看也買不着什麼出色的國貨。」我拿起代價券，回到家中，幾乎要哭出來。</p>
<h3>我的新衣</h3>
<p>— 舊蒲</p>
<p>因物價不停的上漲，而薪津的增加郤像蝸牛爬行，多年來每月入不敷出，經濟拮据不堪，吃飯尚成問題，添衣就根本不用想，以致衣衫漸漸破舊。妻看了我這副窘態，也不禁傷心起來，時常勸我添做衣服，我明知不能再延緩的了，可是做衣服的錢又在那裏呢？</p>
<p>總算天無絕人之路，　上面看得起，加上底薪四十元大洋，從此每月的收入可以增加一萬五千元，豈不是添製衣服的好機會嗎？將這佳音說給妻聽，妻也非常高興。</p>
<p>時候雖然還未到月半，但心裏巴不得快到月底，可以拿錢添製衣服。好容易耐着性子挨，月底終於到了，當我向會計室領取薪津時雖然不過增加了一萬五千元錢，心中却充滿了希望與快樂</p>
<p>支取了薪津，時間還不過下午五時，決定先去買了布，然後回家。</p>
<p>布莊的玻璃櫃裏的綢布五花入門地陳列着眩人眼員，整疋的細布堆在牆角足足有一個人那樣高，顧客川流不息地進出，夥友穿梭般跑東跑西，一個夥友迎了上來。</p>
<p>「先生，買啥料？」</p>
<p>「制服布料有哦？」</p>
<p>「有。」</p>
<p>他立刻抱了好幾疋布料來：</p>
<p>「先生，這是花呢，最適合做制服用，價鈿包你滿意；那種是美國冲　噦，顏色非常鮮艷大方。」</p>
<p>「這種花呢啥價錢？」</p>
<p>「五千一碼，便宜得很，嘻嘻，冲嗶幾每碼也祇要七千，像你先生穿美國冲嗶變更好。」</p>
<p>我不禁發呆了，七千，五千，連一條褲也做不成了，那裏還想做制服呢？那夥友看了，我在發怔，早已明白了大半：</p>
<p>「還有一種藍卡其每碼祗要，玄色冲　　四千三千五，顏色也很大方的。」</p>
<p>「那末安安藍賣啥價錢？」</p>
<p>「祗售三千，最便宜最大方了。」</p>
<p>最便宜了，一碼三千，一套制服少不了六碼，就要一萬八千，再加上做工八千，天啊！二萬六千該是一筆多麼大的數目啊！我祗能望布興嘆了。</p>
<p>厚着臉皮跨出第一家布店的大門，可是不上幾分鐘，我叉自第四家布店走了出來，雙手仍是空空如也，怎麽辦呢？窮公務員終究無福穿新衣了。</p>
<p>我蹣跚地在街上走着，心中充滿了失望與傷心。百貨商店裘美麗的商品似乎在向我裝鬼臉，布店裏的五顏六色的綢緞也在向我誇耀，爲什麽八年來的我會變得這樣狼狽！</p>
<p>突然，一條强烈的霓虹燈光照射過來，猛地抬起頭，「××提莊」四個大字立刻映入我的眼簾中。</p>
<p>對了，旣然穿不起新衣，買套半新舊的也是好的。</p>
<p>跨入提莊，倒也有不少制服掛在牆上，可是價格祗比新的便宜一二成，最後在牆角旁看到一套八成新綫呢的，標價一萬七。</p>
<p>經過長時間的折衝，費了許多口沫，才用一萬五千的代價買了來。</p>
<p>於是多年來沒有穿過一套新衣的我，今天也總算有了一套新衣了。</p>
<h3>如此考試</h3>
<p>— 定江</p>
<p>××大學第二次考試，今天考了；我恰是派在徐匯中學，下午公民的考試，題目的確有些難。然而我們的×北同學，領了頭，大批的退出試塲。我想這種英雄有爲的　　。揚長而去的態度，的確可以敬佩。然而當我者究出去時，看見這些人正在拿着書，大抄特抄，抄完了，進去交卷，還得跟監考的搗蛋。監考的也隨他們去了。這種怪現象的發現，使我對於學生高潔無瑕的心理，受了極重的打擊。</p>
<p>現代的若干敗類，以及漢奸，正有許多在五四運動中是最熱烈的，然而惡劣社會的陶冶，使他們成了無康恥的貪官污吏。如今想起來，這些名爲大學生者，在學生時代已經如此卑鄙，那麽，他們如果一且執政治國，又是如何！</p>
<p>我不願意想，也不堪想了，敎育第一的建國時期的怪現狀，只覺得言之痛心，思之淚下！</p>
<h3>樹木與樹人</h3>
<p>蒙梯賽羅大學學生畢業時在校區內植樹一株，以留紀念。</p>
<h3>學生當侍者</h3>
<p>— 忠祈</p>
<p>生活隨筆</p>
<p>我是一個學生。</p>
<p>暑假裏，二個月的時間終不能讓它白白地浪費。何况，一個學生應該能够有自己賺錢來供給學費的精神，以免老父在酷熱的天氣中替我們子女四出奔走，張羅學費，那簡直好像叫父親做牛馬一樣，做子女的怎樣說得過去</p>
<p>因此，今年的暑假。我到一家糖果冷飲店去工作。雖然，這種地位就是萬人蔑視的Boy，而薪給更是低微得可憐，但唯其如此，正足以給我體味到僕歐生活倒低是怎樣的；同時，一日三餐是至少可以解決的了，那末，也可稍减父親的負擔。</p>
<p>好在，學生權充侍者，並不是沒有前例。記得幾年前，國際大飯店曾經公開登報徵求大學生做侍者。當時，各報上也展開了一次激烈的辯論。有人認爲這種塲所過份奢侈華糜，是罪惡的淵藪，不是純潔樸實的學生所應寄身的地方。有人却認爲半工半讀，勞工神聖，爲何不讓從未踏進過社會的學生去充實一下生活經騐呢？</p>
<p>可是，現在我相信，「勞工神聖」這句話究竟是一種理想，事實並不如此。不信且看那一種勞工在今日被視爲神聖？普遍地說一句，我們這種以勞力來換取生活的工作，至今依舊是被一般人所認爲低賤。常常有許多顧客自視甚高，對我們　出少爺或太太的架子來，頂好把我們呼之即來，斥之即去，或者嫌服侍得不週到。譬如說，客人吃汽水，我們拿了杯子給他，他偏會要麥吸管子；給了他麥吸管子，又偏要杯子了。如果兩件都給他，那末有遧老闆命令，這豈不是叫我們做難人嗎　時，我們一定只好諾聲唯唯地答應着：「是，是！」那末，他們方才覺得勝利了。對於這種做慢的態度，經常地，我們也會產生些反抗的情緒。不過，我們爲了維持商業的道德起見，雖然有些地方事與願違，也只好忍氣乔聲，不去計較它了。</p>
<p>話又得說同來了，好的顧客未始沒有。他們倒很體念商艱，瞭解我們的苦衷。常然，逍時「勞工神聖」的理想又會蕩漾在我們的腦海裏，而讓我們感到「事實是理想之母」這句話是不錯的，即使身體疲乏些，也給暫時的滿足所塡沒了。</p>
<p>的確，我們的工作是相當的繁勞，早晨七時開始，一直要到深晚十二時止，除了吃飯時間外，差不多工作十幾小時而沒有絲毫的休息。早晨冷飲雖少，但麵包糖醬的生意忙得非凡；中午以後，冷飮絡繹不斷；直到打烊以後，還得來一番整理打掃的工作：洗茶具，煮面巾，揩櫉窗，刷地板，諸如此類的工作都落在我們的身上。每天不到一時決不能人睡，統計一天不過休息五六小時，叫我們白天怎樣還有精神去應付顧客，做這樣繁重的工作呢？白日一天的跑來跑去，已經使我們兩腿發酸，一躺到牀上，眞是「不知東方之旣白」！這就是我們一天的生活。</p>
<p>說也可憐，像我們這樣的工作，論理應該到得相當的報酬·但，現在我們最大的收入—小賬，也成了問題，原因是營業稅需要另加二成，成本無形中提高，小賬的收入常然也大受影響。</p>
<p>做了僅十天的侍者，偶然對鏡一照，發現人已消瘦了許多，記得小時候讀劉半晨的「學徒苦」，描寫一個「生我者父母」的學徒生活，與我們做侍者的又相差得了多少呢？</p>
<h3>女團長逃出火坑　情願當一個傭人</h3>
<p>— 佑芙</p>
<p>因爲上海傭人難服侍，我托朋友代覓江北傭人。恰巧樓下隣居的傭人，是個年近六八十的老太婆，她有一個媳婦，剛從蘇北逃到上海，正在找一樓息之所。因此，我就僱了她的媳婦。她是一個約摸廿來歲的少婦，有鄉下姑娘的美，身體粗而壯。做起事來旣快又實在，我很滿意。</p>
<p>但是過了半個月，她好像沒有初來時那麽好，那麼認眞做事，她好似帶有丘八的氣息，長官的風度，架子亦漸漸大起來·什麽事好像很勉强。</p>
<p>最近她更大變而特變了，做事似理非理，帶睬不睬。我以爲她不願意繼續工作下去，或嫌苦，工錢少的原故吧！於是，叫我的太太問問她一個究竟。她就乘着家裏沒有一個人的機會去問她，到底爲什麽不開懷，鬱愁不展？她的回答是：「我的事，太太不能替我解決，所以也不便說·」</p>
<p>我的太太更認爲曰是件奇怪的事，好奇心驅使她分外的注意，仍然不甘休地窮根究底，非得答覆不可。輕過再三的詢問，我終於得到了一件不可吿人的　痛曲折離奇的新聞：</p>
<p>她原來不是傭人，而是一個女團長。當共軍踏入蘇北泰興以後，她就被强迫徴調受訓，爲了她年靑貌美，體强力壯。據說追求她的人大有人在。因爲這許多因素，她又被迫主持「婦女訓練「，榮任「團長」之職。每天，她要率領着五六百女兵出操。但是，雖然如此，她整天以淚水洗面，過着極痛苦的日子。他們種種卑污行爲，跟着民主與解放口號而俱來。壓迫着她透不出氣來。她不能再生存下去，她痛苦極了，因此終於以尋找丈夫爲由，請短假來滬，（並有保人擔保，）逃出了解放區，脫離了苦海。</p>
<p>但是命運註定了她，不幸之神依舊環繞着她。現在，她的保人奉命來滬找她回去，如果不回去，田地沒收，房屋燒光，家財充公，保人槍斃。因此，她處於極度的焦慮中。</p>
<p>不過，她已經和她在滬的家　開了一次緊急的家庭會議，決定不回去。因爲不去周然糟，回去也難免遭殃。據保人說：「共軍認爲她一去不復返，是蒙蔽上峰一投誠老中央，她是漢奸。」結果，連到滬找她的「保人」（請假時的保人）也不回去了。他們回去不得，家鄉產業也只好任它去了！</p>
<p>她情願當傭人，「團長」實在幹不下了。</p>
<p>新聞人物</p>
<h3>下台了的李維諾夫</h3>
<p>— 錢蕃甫</p>
<p>「集體安全」的倡導者</p>
<p>據聯合社倫敦二十四日電傳：蘇聯「外次」李維諾夫已被免職。這位曾一度名播全球的外交家，從此宣吿脫離世界政治舞台。月前李氏已届七十高齡，綜計他從事外交家的生涯，自一九一七年被任爲蘇聯駐英全權代表起，至最近解職止，前後恰滿三十年，蘇聯由革命成功到躍登强國地位，其間的因果內情，李氏可詐心頭了然。</p>
<p>李維諾先生於一八七六年，父親是一個名喚培洛司託克的猶太人，家境小康。他自幼就被送入商科學校就讀，十七歲畢業以後，曾在「帝俄」軍中服役，但爲了被當時盛行的社會主義思想所感召，遂在一八九八年加人「俄羅斯社會民主工黨」——則蘇聯共產黨的前身。</p>
<p>投身人黨以後·他努力於革命工作，一九〇一年，爲皇室密探逮捕，判處徒刑六年，充軍至西伯里亞，在黑獄中渡過一年又半，便與同志十一人越獄逃抵瑞士，就在此時，得識列寧。和他們一同過着海外飄泊的生涯。一九〇三年，黨部改組，李氏正式加入了「共產黨」，一九〇五年，潛行回國，在伏　　　拉爾附近，作秘密活動。</p>
<p>一九一七年，一十月革命」產生，蘇維埃政府成立，他被任駐英全權代表。不久，回國任「外次」職·一九三〇年，升任人民外交委員長。從一九一八至一九三五年問，李氏曾不斷地作國際性的旅行，同時借此作爲外交談判的手段。這一個時期，是他的政治生命的黃金時代。</p>
<p>一九二七年，他代表蘇聯參加「日內瓦軍縮會議」，提出一件議案：主張各國完全廢除軍備。大爲世人驚嘆，他的聲譽日隆，言語行動隨時都受世人注意，並獲得「和平使者」的稱號。</p>
<p>李氏在職期間，運用他的機智手　，與資本主義的强國週旋，鞏固了蘇聯的國際地位，他曾與歐美列强，簽訂互助公約，解除了不少國際的紛爭，但因此被目爲親英美的蘇聯外交家。所以，有人懷疑：這次李氏的被免，不啻是國際關係，眼前已到達極端複雜，嚴重的說明。</p>

<h3>Prior to Departure, Special Envoy Ma Has an Extended Conversation with the Chairman, Returning to Beijing from Kuling, Making Efforts to Break the Deadlock and Achieving Progress</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kuling by Our Newspaper, 27th] Special Envoy Marshall called on Chairman Chiang at 11:30 a.m. on the 27th for their second official meeting since arriving in Kuling, lasting for an hour. Madame Chiang was also present. After the conversation, they had lunch in the garden of the headquarters, with Madame Marshall also attending. After lunch at 2:10 p.m., Chairman and Madame Chiang accompanied Special Envoy and Madame Marshall back to their residence before returning a few minutes later. Special Envoy Ma left Kuling for Xunyang and flew to Beijing at 2:30 p.m., accompanied by Military Aide Zong Gan and others. Madame Marshall also specially escorted him to Xiaotianchi before departing. It is said that Special Envoy Ma will come to the mountain for the sixth time this weekend.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kuling by Our Newspaper, 27th] Before Special Envoy Ma left Kuling to return to Beijing, he had a long conversation with the Chairman. The Chairman and Madame Chiang expressed their admiration for Special Envoy Ma's tireless efforts, despite being in his sixties, to achieve peace, national unity, and unification in China, displaying a persistent and unwavering spirit. They personally visited Special Envoy Ma's residence to see him off. According to an observer: The government may, in principle, agree to the new proposals made by Mr. Ma and Mr. Stuart to both the government and the Communist Party for mediating the domestic disputes in China. Individuals in both Nanjing and Kuling believe that the best way to break the current deadlock is to follow the six major guidelines listed in the Chairman's August 14th statement, assess their urgency, consider the timing, discuss the implementation procedures, and hope for comprehensive peace.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Kuling by the Central News Agency, 27th] According to well-informed sources: Special Envoy Ma's five visits to Kuling have resulted in some progress in his efforts to break the current deadlock.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper, 27th] Special Envoy Ma returned to Nanjing at 6:45 p.m. on the 27th. Ambassador Stuart visited his residence at 7:10 p.m. for a lengthy discussion.</p>
<p>Government and American Personnel Did Not Comment on the CCP Statement</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper, 27th] After the Communist Party's statement was issued yesterday, neither the government nor American personnel here have made any comments. Current political activities in the capital depend on Marshal Ma's return to Beijing with Chairman Chiang's opinions before any decisions are made. Furthermore, evening newspapers reported that the Communist Party would issue another statement after Marshal Ma's return to Beijing. However, according to a CCP spokesperson, there are no such plans.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper, 27th] According to a relevant source: Zhou Enlai's claims at yesterday's press conference that the Communist Party had accepted the idea of reorganizing the government first, then ceasing hostilities, only if they received guarantees and the government did not raise the five demands again, are a distortion of the truth. Reorganizing the government was a resolution of the Political Consultative Conference and should be faithfully implemented. As for the so-called five demands, these are old, unresolved cases from the past, not new topics. The current situation depends on Marshal Ma's return to Beijing before anything becomes clear.</p>
<h3>After Inspecting the Garrison in Changzhou, Wuxi, and Suzhou, Xu Tingyao and Others Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday; The General Parachute Inspection Will Be Held in Beijing on the Fifth of Next Month</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Suzhou by Our Newspaper, 27th] In order to understand the situation of the National Army after reorganization in various regions, the Chairman of the National Government has successively dispatched high-ranking officials to inspect. This time, to inspect various special forces, a "Chairman's Personal Inspection Group" was specially formed, headed by Minister Bai of the Ministry of National Defense as his representative, and led by Lieutenant General Xu Tingyao, the Director of Mechanized Forces, and Lieutenant General Ma Chongliu, the Military Aide of the National Government.

The artillery group was ordered to stay in Suzhou to inspect the 16th Artillery Regiment before rejoining them in Shanghai. It is understood that the inspection group will return to Beijing to report after completing the inspection mission in Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper, 27th] The general parachute inspection is scheduled to be held at Ming Palace Airport on the 5th of next month, with Minister Bai of the Ministry of National Defense serving as the inspection officer.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Changzhou] The "Chairman's Personal Inspection Group," consisting of thirty-six officers and generals, led by Lieutenant General Xu Tingyao, the Director of Mechanical Forces, and Lieutenant General Ma Chongliu, the Military Aide of the National Government, departed from Beijing by express train at around 9 a.m. on the 25th and arrived in Changzhou at 11:55 a.m. Commander Li Mo'an of the First Pacification Zone, Deputy Chief of Staff Li Yuankai, and Parachute Battalion Commander Zhang, County Magistrate Sun, Chief Secretary Sheng, Director Zhou, and others all welcomed them at the station.

He said that after the reorganization of the National Army, Chairman Chiang originally intended to personally inspect each location, but due to the heavy burden of national affairs, he specially delegated Minister Bai of the Ministry of National Defense to act on his behalf. Minister Bai is currently staying in Kuling on official business, so he entrusted Military Supervisor Xu and himself, under the name of the "Chairman's Personal Inspection Group," to lead the inspection officers to Changzhou. As for the inspection work, it includes land-air liaison, logistics, transportation, joint services, health, tanks, artillery, communications, logistics, and other groups, as well as the equipment and defense situation after this decision to streamline the military.

He inquired in detail about the production and sales of oil cakes in this county.</p>

The U.S. military stationed in Qingdao will continue to assist the local government in maintaining order in the same spirit as in the past. When asked by reporters about rumors that the U.S. military stationed in Shanghai would be transferred to Qingdao, he replied: There are only two squads of U.S. Marines currently stationed in Shanghai, one being necessary personnel for the air force, and one being personnel administrators, and there is no news of them coming to Qingdao.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper, 27th] When interviewed by reporters on the 27th, American military personnel here did not deny the rumor that the U.S. military in China is "about to" withdraw, but refused to announce the exact date of withdrawal, and implicitly stated that some personnel will remain in China to work in the future.

<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing by the United Press, 27th] According to a telegram from Pan Yang, Lin Biao and his military advisors have decided to divide Northeast China into several war zones and have chosen Jiamusi, 300 kilometers northeast of Harbin, as the location of their political headquarters.</p>

<h3>The Communist Army Continues to Demolish the Ming Tombs</h3>
<p>The Hebei Provincial Government Telegraphed the Military Mediation Department to Stop It</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Tianjin by Our Newspaper, 27th] The Communist army in Changping is continuing to demolish the Ming Tombs, seemingly intent on destroying all thirteen tombs. The Hebei Provincial Government has once again telegraphed the Military Mediation Department to stop it immediately.</p>

<h3>The Northeast Nine Provinces and Regions Plan, The Headquarters Denies Changes</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Jiyang by Our Newspaper, 25th] Regarding the issue of changes to the administrative divisions of the nine northeastern provinces, the rumors in Beijing and Ping are rampant. According to the Headquarters, the government is currently promoting governance in Northern Anhui according to the established plan. The Political Committee has absolutely no intention of changing the administrative divisions. Moreover, many provinces and regions in the Northeast have not yet been recovered. The central government has always sought stability in local administration. Since the provinces and regions have already been demarcated, it seems difficult to change them easily. The rumors in Beijing and Ping may be private suggestions, and the Headquarters Political Committee has no such intention.</p>

<h3>The Communist Army Reinforces and Fiercely Attacks, The Battles Around Datong are Fierce</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Tianjin by Our Newspaper, 27th] The battle around Datong is being conducted fiercely in a seesaw state. Nie Rongzhen's offensive has been repeatedly frustrated, and three regiments of troops were transferred from Zhangjiakou.

On the 26th, the Communist Army launched fierce attacks on the military station, alcohol factory, and flour mill in the north of the city, and Caofoulou in the east of the city. As a result, the railway station and other data points were invaded, and fierce battles occurred. However, the two weeks of seesaw battles have instilled strong confidence in the National Army defending the city, so the defense is very strong.</p>

<h3>The Government Representatives of the Military Mediation Department Submitted a Memorandum to the Communist Party, Protesting the Dispute Over Witnesses in Anping</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Beiping by Our Newspaper, 27th] Due to ineffective mediation and the escalating war, the Military Mediation Department has completely lost its spirit of mutual tolerance and understanding and has become a superficial mutual attack.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Beiping by Our Newspaper, 27th] The investigation of the Anping incident is still at a standstill. Deputy Member Daberman of the American side of the Executive Headquarters and Colonel Martin, the representative of the 25th Group, exchanged views with Ye Jianying yesterday, and decided to put aside the trivial issues that occurred during the previous investigation in Anping and immediately resume the investigation. At 9 a.m. on the 27th, Martin convened a meeting of the representatives of the government and the Communist Party. At the meeting, Zhang Shuheng, the representative of the government, said: During the previous investigation in Anping, Representative Huang of the Communist Party first stated that the military and political situation in Anping Town had changed, and all witnesses, evidence, and testimony were not credible. Secondly, he said that if the interrogation was not completed in Anping that day, the witnesses there would have the opportunity to change their testimony, and he doubted that the government could be responsible for the witnesses in Anping. If Representative Huang's views were not changed, there would be no need to go to Anping for investigation again. At this point, Zhang asked Huang Yifeng if he had changed the above views. Huang Yifeng did not answer, so the chairman declared the meeting adjourned. It is understood that the government has followed the United States in sending a memorandum to the Communist Party to protest the attitude of the Communist Party representative who had a dispute over witnesses in Anping. Roughly, the government will resume the meeting after the Communist Party gives a satisfactory answer. As for the statement made by Wang Ting, a member of the Anping Township Association, that the Communist Army had captured two American soldiers, the American side remained silent. The Communist Party's Xinhua News Agency manuscript on the 27th also mentioned the testimony about this matter, but did not make any criticism. How the matter will progress is highly speculative.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Beiping by Our Newspaper, 27th] The spokesperson for the Communist Party in the Military Mediation Department issued a written statement on the 27th, stating: "On August 1, the Beiping World Daily wrote that recently, personnel from a certain party had infiltrated Beiping to carry out robbery, assassination, and espionage activities. On August 10, Cai Wenzhi, the Chief of Staff of the Executive Headquarters, used this as a basis to submit a memorandum to the American side of the Executive Headquarters, stating: I (Cai) have learned that all Communist Party members of the Executive Team, in addition to performing their duties of peaceful work, have been engaged in espionage activities. It continued: I believe that when a Communist Party member of the Executive Team is found to be a spy, he loses the privileges of being a member of the Executive Team and should be subject to legal sanctions. On August 11, another memorandum was sent to the American side, using the aforementioned news from the World Daily as a basis to prove that 'the Communist Party has sent its personnel to Ping to create chaos,' stating that 'the government authorities have done everything possible to maintain local security and social order in Beiping.' On August 23, the Xinmin Daily published a speech by Tang Yongxian, the director of the Ping City Public Security Bureau, stating: One of the reasons for the banditry in Ping City is that the tea party has organized assassination and robbery, and has special identities to cover them up. On the 24th, the Xinsheng Daily openly stated that the Communist Army instructed bandits to disrupt the security of Ping City, and these bandits were led by a certain important member of the Executive Headquarters. The spokesperson believes that this is a 'organized and planned conspiracy' to 'attempt to frame and arrest Communist Party members and destroy the existence of the Executive Headquarters.' It continued: The Communist Party has issued warnings to the Kuomintang authorities in Nanjing and Beiping, stating: 'Communist Party members came to the government area at the invitation of the American and Chinese sides and in accordance with the tripartite agreement to undertake mediation tasks, so in addition to requesting the removal of Cai Wenzhi and Tang Yongxian, if Communist Party members are harmed, go missing, or otherwise infringed upon in the government area, the Communist Party will not tolerate it.'"</p>
<h3>The Soviet Side Firmly Denies the Rumor of a Secret Agreement Between the Three Countries</h3>

<h3>Another Assassination Case in Kunming, Liu Zhihuan and Sun Duolan Were Shot and Seriously Injured, Rumors Say the Cause Was a Family Dispute</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Kunming by Our Newspaper, 26th] An assassination case occurred easily in Kunming yesterday. The injured were two people, the man was Liu Zhihuan, who had served as a cadre and secretary of the Yunnan branch of the Youth League, and the woman was Sun Duolan, who was the wife of Liu Yaoyang (also known as Liu Shangshi), the former Chief of Staff of the Kunming Headquarters. At around 12 o'clock last night, after the two watched the new play "Chen Yuanyuan" at the Provincial Party Headquarters, they took a car back to Sun's residence in Shangyuan on Daguan Road from the entrance of the Provincial Party Headquarters. The car suddenly stopped in the middle of the road, and the driver Li Heng falsely claimed that the oil was exhausted, and immediately got out of the car and opened fire with a man lying in ambush beside the road, sniping at Liu and Sun. At that time, Liu was shot twice, and his tongue was broken. Sun was shot twice, both in the head, and her injuries were quite serious. After being sniped, Liu chased the murderer for more than ten steps before collapsing. He was then sent to Kunhua Hospital for treatment by nearby residents. Both are no longer in life-threatening condition. The murderer Li Heng is an active-duty soldier, a lieutenant adjutant of a certain unit, and was arrested by the police at the train station on the Sichuan-Yunnan Road at around 6 o'clock this morning. A left-handed pistol used in the murder was also seized and has been handed over to the security authorities for interrogation. It is said that the reason for the assassination is related to a family dispute.</p>
<h3>Sakai Takao is Sentenced to Death, The Crime of Indiscriminate Slaughter, Rape, and Robbery is Extremely Heinous</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing by Our Newspaper, 27th] The Japanese war criminal Sakai Takao was publicly sentenced to death by Shi Meiyu, the President of the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense, at the Lizi Society in the capital at 3 p.m. on the 27th. The main text of the judgment is as follows: "Sakai Takao participated in the war of aggression, indiscriminately slaughtered prisoners of war, wounded soldiers, and non-combatants, and raped and robbed civilians, abused torture, and destroyed property, and is sentenced to death." When the defendant Sakai Takao was escorted to the court, he was still wearing a Tibetan-colored suit, black leather boots, and holding documents in his hand, and his attitude was still very calm. When the President of the court announced the verdict, the defendant immediately applied for permission to make a further defense after the announcement. Then, in accordance with the law, the President of the court read the judgment, and the translator translated it into Japanese. The defendant took notes while listening and often sneered with an arrogant attitude. Only when the sentence of death was announced did his face show a look of dismay and his body trembled slightly, but he still tried to remain calm. At that time, the President of the court announced, "The defendant is remanded into custody." The defendant strongly requested to make another defense, trying to make a final rescue. The President of the court said: "The judgment must be approved by the Supreme Commander before it can be executed. If you have any comments, you can submit them in writing." The defendant was remanded into custody with a helpless expression.</p>

<h3>Second Important Statement from the U.S. Regarding China: Sale of Surplus Goods Contains No Military Supplies; Negotiations on Civil Aviation Agreement Are Unrelated</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the U.S. Information Service in this City] U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Peterson and Special Assistant to the Secretary of State for Foreign Liquidation Affairs, McCabe, issued a statement today through the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai, the contents of which are as follows:</p>
<p>We have noticed reports in the newspapers stating that we are "secretly" negotiating with the Chinese government to sell a large quantity of surplus military supplies, weapons, and other purely military goods to China, and that in order to induce the United States to consider selling these goods, China must grant valuable civil aviation rights to the United States. Such reports are completely unfounded.</p>
<p>What is currently under negotiation is the sale of certain surplus goods to China. These goods are currently stored in the Western Pacific and have an original value of $500 million.</p>
<p>There are absolutely no munitions, weapons, aircraft, or any other purely military goods included in the goods that will be sold to China. All of these surplus goods are civilian-type or purely for civilian use. We believe that China's purchase of these goods will definitely benefit China's reconstruction and its peaceful economic development.</p>
<p>The issue of China's civil aviation rights has never been and will not be involved in the negotiations for the sale of surplus goods. The negotiations regarding the civil aviation agreement are being conducted by Powell, a representative of the State Department. Although Powell came to China on the same plane as us, he is definitely not a member of the surplus goods delegation. Powell's negotiations have absolutely no connection with the surplus goods negotiations.</p>
<p>Powell stated that what he is discussing with the Chinese government is a mutual and reciprocal civil aviation agreement, and that the nature of this agreement is the same as those that the United States has signed with eighteen countries around the world. Powell also stated that once the civil aviation agreement is finalized, its terms will be made public by the State Department.</p>
<p>Peterson and McCabe reiterated that if the sale of surplus goods to China can be successfully completed, it will definitely not be a secret agreement. A comprehensive statement will be issued or a press conference will be held to announce it.</p>
<h3>Illegal Sale of Supplies in China: U.S. Authorities to Begin Investigation</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 26th] Regarding the discovery of the illegal sale of U.S. surplus supplies in China, the U.S. State Department declined to comment. It is only known that the U.S. authorities will begin an investigation soon. The most serious illegal activity is the unauthorized sale of military equipment to the Chinese government, including seven intact bombers.</p>
<p>[United Press, this city] It is reported that the Shanghai office of the U.S. Foreign Surplus Property Disposal Committee transferred ten intact, flyable U.S. B-25 Mitchell bombers to the Central Air Transport Corporation, which appears to be a direct violation of federal regulations that state "combat equipment cannot be sold as surplus property unless specifically authorized by the State Department or the Joint Chiefs of Staff." These bombers were handed over to the Central Air Transport Corporation several months ago and have been submitted by the company to the Ministry of Communications for transfer to the Chinese Air Force.</p>
<p>When asked about the source of the Mitchell bombers, the Central Air Transport Corporation's flight crew informed United Press that they were purchased from the Shanghai office of the U.S. Property Disposal Committee, with a total of about 150 aircraft.</p>
<p>Chen Wen-kuan, director of the Central Air Transport Corporation's flight crew, stated in a meeting with a correspondent from a certain country that some of the B-25 aircraft purchased from the Property Disposal Committee had flight times of less than 700 hours. Chen explained that these aircraft must fly at least 3,000 hours to be considered old. It is reported that the aircraft included B-25D models manufactured in the later stages of the war (referring to the newest model).</p>
<p>Responsible parties emphasized that the transfer of these military aircraft to the Central Air Transport Corporation was not approved by the State Department or the Joint Chiefs of Staff beforehand. Although they could not speak on behalf of Peterson, they expressed deep doubts about the Chinese Communist Party's claim that $500 million of surplus military supplies would be sold to China. It was pointed out that the Property Disposal Committee had agreed to sell a large batch of surplus supplies in the Pacific region, but this would be done in accordance with established regulations and would not involve useful military equipment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a document previously published by Chen Wen-kuan, director of the Central Air Transport Corporation, confirmed United Press's previous report that the Central Air Transport Corporation had purchased aircraft at low prices. According to employees of the Central Air Transport Corporation, the 150 aircraft purchased by the company under contract included ten B-25s, ninety C-46s, two C-87s (these are Liberator bombers converted for cargo use), and more than forty C-47s, with a total value of approximately $500,000. Thus, the average cost per aircraft was only over $30 USD, slightly higher than the selling price of a commercial jeep in Shanghai.</p>
<p>McCabe, chairman of the U.S. Foreign Property Committee, stated: "There is a 'universal standard price' for aircraft of this type, which is approximately $20,000 each."</p>
<h3>Landing Craft "Wanquan" Burns in Fire in Hankou</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this newspaper in Hankou, 27th] The "Wanquan" landing craft of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's (UNRRA) Water Transport Team caught fire yesterday due to a worker throwing a cigarette butt, and the fire burned for several hours. Fortunately, most of the cargo had already been unloaded. Only a few tons of fertilizer were burned, and thanks to the rapid rescue efforts, the machinery was fortunately preserved.</p>
<h3>CCP Shanghai Office Hosts Chinese and Foreign Journalists, Reports on Views on Handling U.S. Surplus Supplies</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] At 3:00 PM yesterday, the CCP Shanghai Office hosted the city's press at 107 Route Massenet, with over 70 Chinese and foreign reporters attending. Only Chen Jiakang spoke on behalf of the CCP. Chen reported the CCP's views on the handling of U.S. surplus supplies, stating that the CCP intends to express a serious protest to the U.S. government and demand an immediate halt. Subsequently, reporters from various newspapers raised questions, and the meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM. The questions and answers are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Question: It is reported that Chen Jiemin, the government representative of the Military Mediation Office's Executive Headquarters, sent a memorandum to Ye Jianying, the CCP representative, stating that if the CCP attacked Datong, government troops would attack Yan'an, Chengde, and Zhangjiakou. Is it true that Ye Jianying has accepted this?</p>
<p>Answer: The CCP has not yet received a report on the response to the memorandum here. However, in principle, if the National Army does not take the offensive, the Communist Army will not attack. Furthermore, CCP documents have never stated an intention to take Datong.</p>
<p>Question: What is the latest situation regarding the CCP's negotiations with the U.S. on the Anping Incident?</p>
<p>Answer: I am unable to comment due to restrictions from the investigation team before there is a formal report.</p>
<p>Question: It was recently reported that the area of dispute between the government and the CCP will be temporarily managed by the United States. The government has denied this. What is the CCP's criticism of this?</p>
<p>Answer: The CCP absolutely opposes this move, as it violates nationalism and national independence.</p>
<p>Question: Recently, there was an article in Yan'an's Liberation Daily attacking Marshal [George] Marshall personally. Is the CCP deeply dissatisfied with the U.S. mediation policy?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Until now, the CCP still welcomes Marshal Marshall's mediation and hopes that it can be successful based on the Moscow Conference's decision. (2) The CCP has always hoped that the U.S. government will end military aid to China.</p>
<p>Question: It has been reported that the murderers in the Zhang Xinfu case were acting on CCP orders. How does the CCP explain this?</p>
<p>Answer: The truth of the matter is still awaiting publication from Yan'an. What is reported in the newspapers is probably one-sided.</p>
<p>Question: How will the CCP deal with the political prisoners detained in Yan'an?</p>
<p>Answer: The CCP has never had political prisoners. Those currently detained are prisoners of war during combat and will be considered for exchange with the government.</p>
<p>Question: Victory has been one year, and the Ryukyu Islands have not yet been returned to China. What is the CCP's opinion?</p>
<p>Answer: The Ryukyu Islands were not assigned to China at the Potsdam Conference.</p>
<p>Question: Nanjing newspapers reported news from the CCP side. What are the details of the Sino-U.S. negotiations on commercial aviation?</p>
<p>Answer: All I know is the news from the Central News Agency in the newspapers here.</p>
<p>Question: What is the CCP's opinion on this aviation negotiation?</p>
<p>Answer: Any matter concerning China's sovereignty should be discussed by the coalition government. Before the coalition government is established, we do not recognize any treaty related to sovereignty signed by any government.</p>
<p>Question: Why is commercial aviation related to sovereignty?</p>
<p>Answer: The past case of inland waterway navigation rights can make this clear. Furthermore, the negotiations are being conducted secretly, making it difficult to know the details, and it is very likely to involve sovereignty.</p>
<p>Question: What is the CCP's opinion on the Li Wen case? What is the CCP's opinion on the Democratic League's request for a trial in Nanjing?</p>
<p>Answer: The Democratic League's request is correct.</p>
<p>Question: Since the murderers in the Li Wen case have already been executed, why are you still dissatisfied with the case?</p>
<p>Answer: It is questionable whether the executed murderers were the real murderers. Who were the murderers in the Li Wen case?</p>
<p>Question: What is the current situation of the war in northern Jiangsu?</p>
<p>Answer: It has been reported that government troops are attacking Shaobo, which shows that the government is taking the offensive in northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>Question: It was reported today that the Communist Army intends to attack Taixing and Taizhou?</p>
<p>Answer: I do not know the details. In short, the CCP is not gaining an advantage in northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>Question: It is reported that Marshall has proposed a new peace negotiation plan. What is the CCP's attitude?</p>
<p>Answer: The CCP's attitude has been clearly stated in the newspapers, that is, it does not reject the suggestion of restructuring before a ceasefire, but there are two conditions, namely: (1) Will there be an unconditional ceasefire after the restructuring of the government is agreed upon? (2) Will the government abandon the CCP's five demands, including the withdrawal from northern Jiangsu?</p>
<p>Question: What is the CCP's opinion on the "Coalition Government"?</p>
<p>Answer: The Coalition Government includes all parties, and the opinions of the CCP and the Kuomintang alone cannot represent everything.</p>
<h3>UNRRA Relief Supplies Stopped in Communist Areas of Hebei and Jehol</h3>
<p>Staff Safety Not Guaranteed</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Beiping, 27th] UNRRA's Hebei-Jehol-Beiping-Tianjin Sub-office has stopped relief efforts in the Communist-controlled areas of Hebei and Jehol because the office's work has consistently been under Communist control. All relief supplies could not be distributed personally by UNRRA staff, and UNRRA's regulations, transportation, and staff safety were not guaranteed. Therefore, the office decided to temporarily suspend the transport of relief supplies to the Communist areas and requested the UNRRA to negotiate with Zhou Enlai. The ban will only be lifted after a satisfactory response is received. The office's staff stationed in Chengde has been withdrawn. Previously, the office transported approximately 2,000 tons of relief supplies to the Communist-controlled areas of Hebei and Jehol. Furthermore, the office's future work will shift from relief to post-disaster assistance, such as improving agricultural production and assisting industrial recovery. It is also planned to open ten thousand wells. For the industries left by the Japanese in Beiping and Tianjin that have been stolen, sold, and destroyed by the Chinese, UNRRA's assistance cannot be expected because UNRRA opposes it. The office also plans to establish a hospital and relief center in each county of Hebei and Jehol within one year.</p>
<h3>"Shandong Disaster" Serious; Relief Plan Has Been Prepared; Minister Gu to Present It to the Chairman Immediately</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] Ding Weifen, chairman of the Shandong Refugee Relief Association, and others hosted a banquet at 12 Cibei Society this afternoon for Gu Zhenggang, the Minister of Social Affairs, who had just returned from an inspection of Shandong, to express their appreciation. According to Gu, the visit to inspect the Shandong disaster lasted eight days, only two days in Jinan, which felt very rushed. However, the impression was very deep, and the "Shandong disaster" is indeed serious and in urgent need of relief. In the areas currently under government control, there are over a million refugees who cannot survive without additional relief. The over 60,000 unemployed workers in the Zibo mining area are in urgent need of relief. In addition, there are many young students who must be accommodated and allowed to attend school. All the refugees escaped in single layers of clothing. As autumn cools, clothing has become a problem. Although the UNRRA Shandong-Qingdao Relief Sub-office and the Shandong Provincial Government have found ways to increase relief supplies and are actively providing relief, the central government must also increase relief supplies and funds for timely relief. Gu stated that he has prepared a plan for relieving the Shandong refugees and will visit the chairman in Guling to present it in a few days.</p>
<h3>Central Government Commemorates Confucius' Birthday Yesterday; Chairman Zhang Ji Explains Significance of Commemoration</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] Yesterday was Confucius' birthday. The central government held a commemoration meeting at the National Government Auditorium at 9:00 AM, chaired by Zhang Ji, who also explained the significance of the commemoration, saying: "Today we commemorate Confucius' birthday for the first time after the eight-year victory of the War of Resistance and the return to the capital, so we feel especially gratified. During this War of Resistance, the Chinese people suffered great losses in lives and property, but they were able to achieve victory in the end, which was due to spiritual strength. What is spiritual strength? It is recalling the great achievements of ancient sages and the glorious history of 5,000 years." Zhang continued: "As the saying goes, after a great war, there will inevitably be a famine. But this year, there is a harvest in various parts of our country. The phenomenon of a great harvest this year in places such as Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi has not been seen in 20 years, so the future of the country is very promising. But unfortunately, there are some people who want to destroy their own country and launch a civil war, and they call it factional disputes. Confucius said, 'The first thing to do is to correct the names.'" Zhang then recounted the evolution of the Confucian orthodoxy from Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, and Confucius, and emphasized the achievements of Emperor Wu of Han for the Chinese nation's history, continuing that our Premier [Sun Yat-sen] inherited this orthodoxy and passed it on to the President [Chiang Kai-shek], which is also passed on to our party, so we should urgently promote the way of the sages and not disgrace ourselves, so as not to invite disgrace, and especially should follow the clear teachings of "being fond of learning is close to wisdom, striving to act is close to benevolence, and knowing shame is close to courage," to hone ourselves. Zhang finally suggested that Confucius temples in various places should be preserved and that Confucianism should be regularly preached. The report lasted for 40 minutes. (There are more commemoration messages from Shanghai and other places, please see page six.)</p>

<h3>Former Responsible Person of the Sixth War Zone Discusses Distribution of Supplies; Makes Statements Regarding Accusations by the Investigation Team</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Hankou, 27th] The former responsible person of the Sixth War Zone Headquarters recently issued a statement regarding the Investigation Team's accusations that the headquarters distributed received supplies to officers and soldiers as spoils of victory. He made a frank statement on the actual circumstances of the authority's expedient handling of the matter. The content first acknowledged that the fact that the headquarters issued the supplies before reporting them was not proper in terms of procedure, but stated that the process was indeed different from what was rumored. (1) Most of the non-military supplies among the received supplies have been submitted and recorded. The portion distributed by the headquarters was only a small part, and the distribution of this small part of supplies was based on the special needs of the environment at the time. For example, candles were distributed temporarily because the lights in Wuhan had not been restored at that time, and the surrender matters were busy, so all agencies had to work all night. Other items such as bicycles, cement, stationery, and paper were used for transportation of official documents, office work, or for repairing barracks, so they had to be distributed temporarily. Other food items such as cigarettes, biscuits, and soy sauce not only would not last long, but some had already become moldy, so they had to be disposed of early to avoid total waste. The responsible person told reporters that given the urgency and distress of the situation at that time, and the depression of the market (difficulty in purchasing), the use of these few received supplies was reasonable and justifiable, and could not be considered excessive behavior. (2) The Investigation Team estimated that the total value of the distributed supplies was approximately 4 billion yuan, which was estimated according to the current market price. The distribution of supplies took place in November of last year. According to the Wuhan District Executive Yuan Special Envoy's Office, the value of the supplies was only 1.8 billion yuan. If estimated at last year's prices, and then subtracting the depreciation, the value would be even less. In addition to the headquarters, the garrison headquarters, and the General Logistics Department, the units that received the spoils of victory included the 11th Regiment of the Constitution, the 3rd Signals Regiment, the 6th Engineer Regiment, the 18th Army, the City Police Bureau, the 8th Motorized Transport Regiment, the Hubei Business School, and more than 40 large units, with a total of at least 25,000 officers and soldiers, not just over 2,000 people. Considering the distribution of this small part of supplies among so many people, it was not too much. (3) The Sixth War Zone was known for its strict military discipline. Although the officers and soldiers' lives were very difficult during the eight years of the War of Resistance, they were able to abide by the law. Since being ordered to come to Hankou to accept the surrender, they had warned their subordinates to strictly observe discipline and strive for quick and accurate acceptance work. In the end, they were able to successfully complete the task. The recently issued "Records of Surrender" by the Army Headquarters stated that the amount of supplies received in this war zone was the highest in the country. The facts are clear and can be used as reference. All distribution situations were reported in person last November when Minister Chen of the Ministry of Military Affairs, Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and Minister Chen of the Organization Department came to Hankou. We believe that it was very open and frank. Finally, the responsible person said that this case has already been estimated by the Executive Yuan that the total value of the supplies is 1.8 billion yuan, and the order has been given to deduct the price and deposit it in the treasury, which should be followed. However, since the headquarters has ended and most of the receiving units have been reorganized, merged, and the personnel have been scattered, it is impossible to recover the price. A request has been submitted to the central government for exemption from deduction. I believe that the central government will consider the difficulties of the officers and soldiers and will give a reasonable solution.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Elected by the People? Or Totalitarian?</h3>
<p>During World War II, the research and application of camouflage techniques reached an unprecedented level of sophistication. The true appearance of things was almost entirely concealed by the use of camouflage, making it nearly impossible to discern the real form from high altitudes or at a distance. This easily achieved a deceptive effect. While such camouflage might fool the enemy, it could never deceive oneself. This is similar to the popularity and development of makeup: it can certainly enhance the beauty of those already blessed with natural charm, but for those who are inherently ugly, no amount of cosmetic enhancement can ultimately hide their ugliness. This is the tragedy of makeup.</p>
<p>Similar situations are found in other fields as well. For example, when the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) representative Zhou Enlai hosted reporters recently, he stated, "I believe that Chairman Chiang's proclamation 'not only fails to change the situation but also worsens it.' This is because the ceasefire conditions he proposed require the CCP troops to withdraw from many areas and abolish the locally elected governments, which would then be taken over by the Kuomintang's (KMT) one-party government." He also claimed that "after the ceasefire agreement announced in January, the government side consistently failed to implement the ceasefire in the Northeast and did not accept General Marshall's proposal..." Reading this speech, doesn't one feel a sense of the ridiculous, as if someone is trying to hide ugliness with makeup?</p>
<p>"Elected government," what a beautiful phrase! But can there be an elected government in the so-called "liberated" areas under totalitarianism? "Elected" is a type of modern makeup, yet it cannot conceal the traces of totalitarianism, just as powder and lipstick cannot hide ugliness. Even if we take a step back and assume that the CCP troops withdraw but the political system they created remains in place, the people's fear of totalitarianism will not be extinguished. How can the hundreds of thousands of refugees living in exile return to their homes and live in peace? Transportation will still be obstructed, so the problem remains unsolved. As for the claim that the areas would be "taken over by the Kuomintang's one-party government," we need not even point out that the current National Government includes non-partisan and independent figures.</p>
<p>Regarding the Northeast, we see them saying, "...the government side consistently failed to implement the ceasefire in the Northeast and did not accept General Marshall's proposal." What has actually happened these past eight months? Who has been rejecting General Marshall's proposal? The educational level of the Chinese people is relatively low, but they cannot be easily deceived. Wasn't the capture of Changchun and Harbin initiated by the CCP? All of this cannot be concealed by camouflage or makeup. "Elected"? Or totalitarian? The Chinese people understand. No matter how refined the art of makeup, ugliness will ultimately be revealed.</p>
<h3>The English-Soviet Relationship Seen Through the Greek-Albanian Issue</h3>
<p>The United Nations Security Council is meeting in New York today to discuss the applications of several non-member states to join the UN. It will also address the Ukrainian representative Mr. Manuilsky's accusations against Greece, placing the border conflict between Greece and Albania as one of the most important international issues currently.</p>
<p>On the 24th of this month, Mr. Manuilsky, the Ukrainian representative, suddenly sent a telegram to the UN General Assembly Secretary-General Mr. Lie, requesting that the Security Council include the border conflict between Greece and Albania on the agenda for the next meeting. His reasons were fourfold: (1) Greece repeatedly provoked Albania, leading to border conflicts that could endanger peace in the Balkans; (2) Speeches by Greek representatives at the Paris Peace Conference intensified the relations between Greece and Albania; (3) Greece mistreated ethnic minorities within its borders; (4) Greece used propaganda to attempt to redraw Balkan borders. Finally, Manuilsky also condemned the continued presence of British troops in Greece as interference in Greek domestic affairs. Thus, it is clear that the Ukrainian representative's complaint is not a simple matter involving only Greece and Albania; rather, it has a complex and subtle international background, making it extremely difficult for the Security Council to handle this matter.</p>
<p>Firstly, Manuilsky's accusation against Greece to the Security Council is clearly a kind of "diplomatic counter-offensive" by the Soviet Union in Europe. Since the opening of the Paris Peace Conference at the Luxembourg Palace, the Soviet Union has repeatedly suffered setbacks in verbal battles due to being "outnumbered and outgunned." Not only has the Soviet Union lost face, but it has also been quite demoralized. Therefore, it sought to launch an offensive outside the Paris Peace Conference to boost Soviet morale. The Soviet Union's sudden notification to Turkey, demanding that the two countries conduct negotiations to revise the Montreux Convention and further change the legal status of the Dardanelles Strait, also stemmed from this motive. However, Turkey's attitude remained calm and unyielding to any threat, and the opinions of Britain and the United States were completely aligned. It is expected that the Soviet Union will hardly achieve the results it desires, so Manuilsky launched a diplomatic counter-offensive in another area.</p>
<p>Secondly, today's Greece has become the target of criticism in the Balkan Peninsula, especially since the current Greek government has requested that British troops remain stationed in the country, which has provoked the Soviet Union's antipathy. Therefore, at the Paris Peace Conference, Greece and the countries belonging to the Soviet bloc, namely the Soviet Union, Belarus, Ukraine, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, have been diametrically opposed to each other everywhere. Whenever a problem is raised for discussion, it leads to a pointless verbal battle. Overall, the focal points of conflict between the two sides also include the following three items: (1) Greece is unwilling for the Albanian representative to present opinions at the conference; however, the Soviet bloc is supporting Albania behind the scenes; (2) Bulgaria demands access to the Aegean Sea directly through Greek Thrace; (3) Greece has territorial demands on Albania, attempting to obtain the Epirus region of Albania. Judging from these three points, one can also know the complexity and subtlety of this Balkan issue.</p>
<p>Thirdly, regarding the British military's stay in Greece, the Ukrainian representative pointed out to the United Nations General Assembly in January of this year that this matter could endanger world peace. Britain immediately replied that the British military's stay in Greece was at the request of the Greek government, which left the Ukrainian representative with no words to counter, so he automatically abandoned the issue. This time, Manuilsky rehashed the old story, bringing up all the new and old grudges between Britain and the Soviet Union. Therefore, the dispute between Greece and Albania is only directly related to the two countries on the surface, but in reality, it is a blatant manifestation of the conflict between Britain and the Soviet Union. After this event occurred, people generally worried about the future of the peace conference. In fact, what is affected is not just the Paris Peace Conference. Whether the UN Security Council can overcome difficulties and become an effective organization for maintaining world peace has also encountered a major test.</p>
<p>Looking at the current world situation, international contradictions are intensifying, and the opposition between the two major blocs is becoming increasingly apparent. Countries have different views on any issue, even sticking to their own arguments and arguing until they are red in the face, refusing to concede. Therefore, international disputes are arising one after another, and a true peace has not yet come to the world one year after the end of the war. Now everyone is looking forward to the success of the Paris Peace Conference to clarify European politics as soon as possible, but the Paris Peace Conference has been going on for "a full month" since it opened, and all that has been heard is the noise of representatives from various countries arguing, but no results have been seen. If this situation is not remedied, the Paris Peace Conference will fall into a state of semi-dormancy, and even by the end of this year, it may still not be able to "conclude successfully." Now London, Paris, Washington and other places are spreading the possibility that the Four Foreign Ministers Conference will be reconvened. This may not be a bad idea, but we are already accustomed to international conferences, especially in the year since the end of the war, with one UN conference after another, one foreign ministers' conference after another, and no concrete and effective solution has been negotiated, merely shifting our attention from one place to another. If international conferences are to succeed, it is necessary to restore the spirit of working together to defeat the enemy during the war. Only when the United Nations uses the spirit of striving for victory to create peace can world peace be realized.</p>
<h3>Minister Peng Holds Reception in Nanjing to Welcome American Writer Corwin; Corwin States the Whole World Yearns for Peace</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] Minister Peng Xuepei of the Central Propaganda Department held a reception at the International Club at 5:30 PM today to welcome American writer Corwin, who arrived in Nanjing yesterday. Guests included Mr. and Mrs. Sun Ke, Kong Xiangxi, Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, Gan Naiguang, Hong Lanyou, and over a hundred Chinese and foreign reporters. Corwin is the first recipient of the "One World" award, and coincidentally, today is the birthday of Confucius, the advocate of "all men are brothers," which adds profound significance to the occasion.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Corwin attended the reception hosted by Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department at 5:30 PM on the 27th and delivered an impromptu speech, saying: "After coming to China, I finally understood why Willkie spoke so highly of China in his book 'One World.' The United States is a nation that emphasizes fairness and reason, and is also somewhat 'sensitive.' Fortunately, it is also the wealthiest country in the world, so it is extremely concerned about the world, hoping that the world can be safe and peaceful. This is why it pays so much attention to China. The world today is very different from the past. 'One World' has become a 'necessity,' a 'military' necessity, because in this atomic age, we cannot afford to have five or six worlds. Therefore, President Roosevelt deeply abhorred war. In fact, everyone hates war. We need to unite with each other. This is true for Europe, and I hope it will be true for other places (including here). I am terrified of anything that is contrary to peace. The United States is gradually concerned about China's situation and problems. In fact, our own homes are also full of problems. The occurrence of various problems within a country is no different from quarrels within a family. The important thing is to be able to reconcile them."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] President Sun Ke attended the Corwin reception on the 27th and delivered a brief speech, believing that the issue today is how to realize Confucius's ideal of "all men are brothers." Sun believes that the government and the Kuomintang are sincere about peace, and he also believes that the Communist Party has this sincerity. After eight years of war, everyone yearns for peace. The goals of both sides are the same, the only difference is the means used to achieve these goals. He hopes that on the same platform, they can reach an agreement on general issues and hopes that Corwin's visit will inspire them to make new efforts for peaceful unification.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] American radio writer Corwin, the first recipient of the "One World" award, had a brief conversation with reporters on the 27th, saying that he had many feelings on this trip to China, but needed some time to "digest" them. After arriving in Nanjing, he visited many places and was most impressed by the lotus root and lotus seeds. The sweetness and tenderness of the lotus seeds were something he had never tasted before. When reporters asked about his views on the atomic bomb, he said that people all over the world yearn for peace. He hopes that this atomic energy can be diverted to construction projects to serve the peace and well-being of mankind.</p>

<h3>Local Dispatches</h3>
<p>Wuxi: Hastening the Creation of Registration Records to Impose Land Tax</p>
<p>The county's entire county district clerks have four hundred and sixteen drawings, with each drawing having more than a thousand households, a total of five hundred and thirty-six thousand households. This year's land tax collection is imminent. The creation of registration records is extremely urgent. The provincial government stipulates that an appropriation of six yuan per household and eight thousand yuan per district clerk will be allocated. It is not allowed to collect registration record rice and wheat. The district clerks are ordered to rush the creation, but the various district clerks believe that serving as agents for grain households to supply corvée labor, the government should never issue funding. Rice and wheat (registration record payments) have always been provided by grain households to maintain their livelihoods. Now the interim parliamentary meeting has resolved to abolish it, cutting off their livelihoods. Now the provincial government is still ordering the rushing of the creation of registration records, unifying the deadline for completion before September 15, and stipulates that the creation record funding is 30 million yuan, with each drawing having a standard of 70,000 yuan, but afterwards, it is not allowed to collect registration record rice and wheat. Violators will be punished.</p>
<p>Hefei: Price Fluctuations, Rice Prices Plunge</p>
<p>Since the announcement of the increase in the foreign exchange rate in the city, prices have once again fluctuated greatly. The price of gold has risen from 240,000 yuan per tael to 260,000 yuan, with no market at the price. The prices of yarn and foreign goods have suddenly risen by an average of 20% to 30%, cigarettes by 30% to 40%, and kerosene has risen from 400 yuan per jin to 480 yuan. Not only are many goods hoarded and not sold, but there are also those who take the opportunity to buy them up to monopolize and speculate. As a result, commodity prices are becoming increasingly firm. The authorities are strictly investigating and preventing this. However, the new grain has entered the market and is gradually becoming crowded. Three days ago, the price of new rice was 40,000 yuan per picul, and today (23rd) it has fallen to 24,000 to 25,000 yuan. In the countryside, it has fallen to 20,000 yuan. The livelihoods of public education personnel and common people are slightly easier.</p>
<p>Huzhou: Forcing a Widower to Death, Provoking Public Outrage</p>
<p>In Nanpu Town, under the county's jurisdiction, there is a Xie Arong, over sixty years old, who has been working as a barber and renting a house from the Liu family for many years. Liu has lost his eyesight and usually relies entirely on the assistance of neighbors and relatives to prolong his life. Recently, he owed rent and was unable to pay. Ling Futang, the Liu family's rent collector, told Xie that the house was being taken back for self-use and set a deadline for him to move out. After Xie pleaded in vain, the homeowner's rent collector actually had workers remove the roof tiles, doors, and windows of the house, leaving Xie Arong with nowhere to live and no means of support. He hanged himself in the middle of the night on the 23rd. The next day, neighbors discovered that he had already died. The matter became known to all the residents of the Bao, provoking public outrage, believing that forcing a lonely widower to death was a violation of humanity. The neighbors jointly submitted a petition to the Wuxing Court to report the matter and request legal action to redress the grievances of the deceased.</p>
<p>Yixing: Captured and Escorted Traitor to Suzhou</p>
<p>In Guanlin Town, Yixing Fourth District, there is a Miao Xiaorong. During the enemy's puppet regime, he served as a spy for the enemy army and also served as the captain of the puppet security team. Relying on the enemy's puppet power, he oppressed the people, and more than a hundred people were poisoned by him. Since the victory, Miao fled in fear of punishment. In December of last year, he was once arrested by County Magistrate Wang, but unexpectedly, the traitor was extremely cunning and escaped under the cover of night. By May of this year, all the township chiefs of the district jointly reported him, and he was captured by the county government. It is reported that he has been escorted to the Suzhou High Court for interrogation.</p>
<p>Hangzhou: Issuing Bad Checks and Fleeing with Funds</p>
<p>Zhang Fenggang, from Bazibridge in Tangqi Town, made a living selling silk with his father before the war. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he specialized in being a broker. After the victory, he changed to running Shen Su, which was quite active, so he gained the trust of all parties. On August 13th of this year, he was hired by a merchant shop in Panxi City, not knowing self-love. After a few days, he issued bad checks to easily obtain huge sums of money and goods from various shops and residents, totaling about 30 million yuan, claiming to be going to the Wuxi area, but never returned. Yesterday, the creditors held a creditors' meeting at the Louxi Entertainment Club, recommending Fan Huoyan, Lu Chutang, and Shao Fuchang as the organizers, reporting to the competent authority, applying for provisional execution, and publishing rewards in newspapers. It is said that the largest creditor is Feng Jiasheng, and Yao Yuandeng, the owner of Yao Dasheng Cloth Store, also has one million yuan owed.</p>

<h3>London Conference Convened on September 9 to Discuss Palestine Issue; Britain Has Sent Invitations to Arab and Jewish Nationalities</h3>
<p>[Combined News Report from Our Newspaper] The British government has announced that it will hold a conference with Arab and Jewish representatives in London on September 9 to discuss the Palestine issue. According to a United Press report from London, the British Foreign Office announced on the 26th that it has sent invitations to the governments of Arab countries, the Jewish Agency for Palestine, and the Arab Higher Committee of Palestine. Although Colonial Secretary Hall has discussed the conference issue with Jewish Agency leaders, this is the first time that a formal invitation has been issued to the Agency. The Jewish Agency Executive Committee announced in Paris last week that if the conference is based on the partition plan for Palestine drafted by British and American experts, the Jewish Agency does not intend to attend. The British Foreign Office's announcement did not specify whether the scope of the conference would exceed the plan that Britain has accepted as a basis for negotiation but the United States has not yet agreed to. It is likely that they will first talk to Jewish and Arab representatives separately and then make a decision.</p>
<p>Arab Participation in the Conference Proposed Four Conditions</p>
<p>On the same day that Britain issued the invitations, the Arab Higher Committee of Palestine also issued a memorandum, declaring its four principles for participating in the London Conference: (1) Opposition to any form of partition plan, (2) Palestine should enjoy the political rights of an independent sovereign state in accordance with the promise given to King Hussein by President Wilson's Fourteen Points and the Atlantic Charter of the United Nations Charter, (3) Negotiations should be based on complete independence and not on the Balfour Declaration or the League of Nations' mandate, (4) The delegation does not intend to make specific decisions without obtaining the opinions of the Palestinian Arabs. The memorandum also stated that although the London Conference has no real hope, the Committee has decided to send a delegation to London to attend for the sake of the interests of the Palestinian Arab people. As for the preconditions previously put forward, namely that the Chairman of the Committee, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Hussein, should be one of the representatives, are still valid. However, according to a United Press report, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem colluded with Hitler during the war, which was abhorrent to Britain. British officials had previously publicly stated that they did not want to invite him to participate.</p>
<h3>Disturbances in Tunisia; Pan-Arab Movement Activists Arrested</h3>

<h3>Su'ao Representative Engages in a New Fierce Debate at the Peace Conference Yesterday; Australia Opposes Arbitrary Changes to European Territory; Accuses the Four Powers of Making Bargain-Style Decisions</h3>
<p>[Comprehensive News from This Newspaper] According to Paris Radio: During the meeting of the Economic Committee on Italy on the 27th to discuss reparations, the Australian representative proposed an amendment, believing that this issue must be handled fairly and that the economic situation of the former enemy countries should also be taken into consideration, and they should not be reduced to economic vassals of other countries. During the meeting of the Political and Territorial Committee on Romania, the Australian representative again proposed an amendment, and as a result, the proposal for fair treatment of some parts was passed, while the part concerning the rights of ethnic minorities was opposed by the Soviet representative.</p>
<p>According to a United Press dispatch, another new fierce debate unfolded at the Peace Conference on the 27th, because the Australian representative advocated the establishment of a special investigation committee to investigate the true basis of the various territorial changes decided by the Big Four of the Five-Power Conference. The Australian representative stated that he opposed any territorial changes unless all the behind-the-scenes facts of such changes were known beforehand, and condemned such bargain-style territorial change decisions in the Four-Power Conference. During the meeting of the Italian Political Committee on the 27th, when studying the territorial clauses of the treaty with Italy, the Big Four proposed that Italy should cede four small border areas to France, which immediately aroused fierce debate. Australian representative Hodgson stated that Australia was unwilling to blindly endorse the bargain-style territorial change decisions of the Big Four and suggested that a committee should be formed to study the decision and the reasons behind it, and then submit recommendations to the General Assembly. The Big Four indicated that they would strongly oppose this Australian proposal. Hodgson said: "Australia does not want to be criticized by posterity for blindly accepting the resolutions of the Big Four without understanding the facts. The Atlantic Charter places two obligations on us (including the Big Four): (1) There should be no territorial changes unless it is the wish of the residents; (2) Respect the right of the people to choose their government. I would like to ask whether the Big Four have considered this."</p>
<p>Soviet representative Vyshinsky vehemently criticized Australia's territorial proposal in his reply, accusing Australia of attempting to delay the conference and referring to Hodgson as a "village boy who has just entered the city, hastily writing history, while ignoring the situation before his arrival in the city." Vyshinsky said that Australia's plan would destroy all the work accomplished by the Four Powers' foreign ministers in drafting the peace treaty over several months. Vyshinsky warned that if Australia's proposal were accepted, it would delay the Peace Conference by four to six months. Vyshinsky said: "This proposal reminds me of an opera in which the soldiers sing 'Forward, forward,' but in fact, they are standing in place. Australia's proposal has an air of procrastination." Hodgson replied that the Soviet delegation was trying to shove its fist down the throat of those who questioned the decisions of the Big Four, and then accused the Soviet delegation of delaying the conference. Hodgson then put forward a resolution, proposing that the review of territorial changes be limited to disputed areas. Later, another Australian representative, Peaceley, launched a fierce attack on the Soviet Union; he said, "We refuse to be intimidated by any great power, but the Soviet delegation is delaying the work of the conference. This point should be repeatedly explained so that world opinion knows the suffering we have endured for a month." British Chairman Leefe tried to stop him but was unsuccessful. Peaceley punched the table and pointed his finger directly at Vyshinsky.</p>
<p>According to London Radio, the Economic Committee on Italy and the Political and Territorial Committee on Romania met at 3:00 PM on the 27th. The meeting was adjourned at 6:00 PM. The Political and Territorial Committee on Finland was also scheduled to meet on the 27th, but it was canceled at the last minute. According to Agence France-Presse: During the meeting of the Political and Territorial Committee on Bulgaria on the afternoon of the 26th, the Byelorussian representative proposed an amendment, advocating that Bulgaria be recognized as a common co-belligerent, and that the country had already fought against Germany even before signing the armistice agreement with China. When the proposal was put to a vote, only Byelorussia, Ukraine, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia voted in favor. The remaining countries, including the Soviet Union, opposed it. The Soviet Union insisted that the draft prepared by the Council of Foreign Ministers should remain unchanged.</p>
<h3>We Submit Another Amendment to the Treaty of Peace with Italy</h3>
<p>According to Agence France-Presse: The Chinese delegation submitted another important amendment to the Peace Conference on the 26th. First, regarding the fate of Italian colonies, there were three key points: (1) The final disposition of Italian colonies by the Peace Conference should establish a basic principle, which should be consistent with the trusteeship system stipulated in the United Nations Charter. (2) The Peace Conference should declare to the world that any decision should regard the interests and wishes of the residents of the Italian colonies as the paramount factor. (3) The de jure status of the former colonies should be determined separately according to the political development of each colony. Accordingly, regarding Libya, the treaty should stipulate that it should be granted immediate independence or be placed under United Nations trusteeship for a number of years. Second, regarding the amendment of Sections 18, 19, and 20 of Section 4, "Special Interests for Italy," of the draft treaty of peace with Italy to make it consistent with the current situation, the most important amendment was "Italy agrees to return all property and archives of the former Italian concession in Tianjin to the Chinese government." According to the original text of the draft, "Italy agrees to return all related documents in the archives of the former concession to the Chinese government."</p>
<h3>General de Gaulle Expresses His Opinion on the Draft Constitution</h3>
<p>[News from This Newspaper] Paris, 27th, Urgent Radio: When General de Gaulle expressed his opinion on the draft constitution currently being discussed in the Constituent Assembly, he said, "Giving me the qualification of a layman without any official position, I express my opinion." He briefly stated that the constitution should give the government the greatest possible independence and unity, which is a prerequisite; otherwise, it would only be an untrustworthy institution. Regarding the issue of the French Federation, de Gaulle believed that a joint institution should be created, composed of various regions of the mainland and overseas: a federal president, a federal council, and ministers responsible for various activities within the federation. "These ministers should be jointly responsible." In fact, everything is directed by the president, and if we have several ministers, there is a danger of having several governments.</p>
<h3>Hitler Ordered Goering to Prepare for Germ Warfare</h3>
<p>Confession by Captured German Scientist</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nuremberg, 26th] Captured German scientist Schreiber confessed: Hitler ordered General Goering to prepare for germ warfare. The Germ Warfare Research Institute was established in Poznan, Poland. However, due to the continuous advance of the Red Army, the research work could not proceed. Himmler deeply desired to continue this work, but General Blome, who was in charge of the research, believed that the war was approaching the German border, and if there were no special protective measures, the German military and civilians would inevitably suffer at the same time.</p>
<h3>Anti-Soviet White Russian Immigrants for Over 25 Years on Trial Yesterday at the Moscow Military Tribunal; Main Defendant Had Close Ties with the Japanese Military; Conspiring to Seize Siberia to Strike at Soviet Power in Europe</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 27th] The Supreme Military Tribunal here today began the trial of Semyonov, the leader of the anti-revolutionary Cossacks, and seven accomplices, revealing a major conspiracy by anti-Bolshevik White Russian immigrants in the East, with the assistance of the Japanese, to seize Soviet power, which has been going on for over 25 years. The details are not yet known, but according to White Russian political leaders exiled in New York, the main defendant must undoubtedly be Semyonov, who led a White Russian army in Siberia from 1918 to 1922 and had close ties with the Japanese General Staff. During the interrogation in Moscow, Semyonov confessed that the Japanese once offered to provide 20 million Japanese yen to help him lead anti-revolutionary activities in Siberia, but he refused because he thought the amount was too small. Semyonov and his accomplices were accused of armed resistance, espionage, subversion, and terrorist activities against the Soviet Union. The defendants included Prince Ukhtomsky of the Tsarist era (who was captured by the Red Army in the Northeast), who pleaded guilty to all charges. Most of the defendants were over 70 years old and had served as junior officers in the Tsarist army. Semyonov confessed that after 1920, he and other White Russians working for the Japanese formulated a plan to seize Siberia as a base to defeat Soviet power in Europe. He also established espionage networks in various parts of the East, which ceased operations until Japan surrendered last August.</p>
<h3>American Aircraft Unable to Obtain Landing Rights in Eastern Europe</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 26th] State Department aviation officials announced: The U.S. government has not yet been able to obtain landing rights for American commercial aircraft in most countries within the Soviet sphere of influence in Eastern Europe. To date, the United States has only been able to negotiate a commercial aviation agreement with Czechoslovakia. Poland, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria intend to develop their own aviation with Soviet assistance, so it is very difficult for American aircraft to obtain landing rights there.</p>

<h3>France Withdraws Proposal to Settle Territorial Dispute with Siam in The Hague; Also Opposes Siam's Admission to the United Nations</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 26th] The government officially announced today: The French government has decided to withdraw its proposal for compromise with Siam and demand that Siam return a portion of the Vietnamese and Cambodian provinces occupied in 1941. This decision by France was due to the Siamese government's involvement in the Sirepul village massacre (Sirepul village belongs to Cambodian province, close to Siam, and recently suffered an attack, resulting in several deaths and injuries), and it has informed the US government of this intention. At the same time, the French government is unable to agree to Siam's application to join the United Nations.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the outside world's attention to the French-Siamese dispute began when the Siamese government reported in May that French troops had invaded Siam and bombed villages in the Mekong River area. In July, the Siamese government requested the United Nations to submit the matter to the Security Council, but the US State Department subsequently announced that France had asked the US to find a way to have Siam submit the case to the Hague Tribunal for a ruling.</p>

<h3>Internal Strife Continues Unabated; Indian Crisis Lurks; Jinnah States He Still Has No Intention to Cooperate; British Commissioner to India Being Selected</h3>
<p>[Comprehensive News from This Newspaper] Since the establishment of the Indian Interim Government, Governor-General Wavell made a broadcast speech appealing to the Muslim League for cooperation, but the response from the Muslim League has not been very good, but the door to negotiations has not been completely closed. According to a Reuters dispatch from Bombay, Muslim League Chairman Jinnah issued a statement on the night of the 26th, stating that Governor-General Wavell's move to organize the Indian Interim Government was the most unwise action and not the attitude a politician should have, and it is likely to cause dangerous and serious consequences. I feel that the Governor-General's broadcast is a major blow to the Muslim League and Muslim India, but I hope that Muslims will accept this blow with the spirit of patience and struggle and learn a lesson from our failure to obtain a reasonable position in the Interim Government and the Constituent Assembly. Looking at the candidates for the new government, the three Muslim members appointed by the Governor-General are not respected and trusted by Indian Muslims, which is an insult. We have repeatedly stated that the partition of India is the only way to solve the Indian problem. The Governor-General said in his broadcast that "the door to suggestions is still open," and I don't know what this means, but I am pleased that the Governor-General, on behalf of the Congress Party, stated that a coalition government in which both major parties are represented is still needed and that the Muslim League should continue to be involved.</p>
<p>On the Congress Party side, since Chairman Nehru has taken office as the head of the Indian Interim Government, a new chairman will be elected at the Executive Committee meeting on the 27th. Former Congress Party Chairman Acharya Kripalani and recently retired Congress Party Secretary-General Kripalani seem to be the most likely to be elected.</p>
<p>After the Interim Government is established and formally exercises its powers, the "Custodian Government" led by the Governor-General will immediately be declared over, and the rule of the Governor-General representing the British King will also be terminated at the same time. According to Agence France-Presse, London, 26th, Downing Street No. 10, the Prime Minister's residence, announced that Britain intends to establish a High Commission in India and is actively preparing for it. All staff are expected to travel to India in mid-September with Acting High Commissioner Simons. As for the candidate for High Commissioner, the Foreign Office will appoint him and will announce the appointment soon, and he is expected to take office in November.</p>
<p>According to a United Press dispatch, the current situation in India, although seemingly calm on the surface, is in fact, the internal crisis is becoming increasingly significant. This is not only an internal dispute between Indians and Muslims, but also includes the entire difficult problem of the relationship between the Indian people and the British rulers. The future development of this matter may be so serious that the so-called problems of Palestine and others will pale in comparison. The Interim Government has been established, the Congress Party has an overwhelming majority, and their slogan has always been "British rulers withdraw from India." Congress Party leader and Interim Government Chairman Nehru has publicly stated that once the Interim Government is established, if the Governor-General appointed by Britain still wants to exercise any power, "he will conflict with us." The Congress Party's attitude towards demanding "British withdrawal from India" has not changed at all. Observers generally believe that a full-scale conflict between India and Britain is not far off. In fact, if the Indian and Muslim parties want to seek unity and achieve true independence for India, they must shift their goal and fight against Britain.</p>
<h3>Our Country's Baojia System Spreads to India</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 27th] Riots continue unabated in various parts of India, and public security is worrying.

All residents are incorporated into mutual security groups, and mutual security chiefs are established. These mutual security chiefs form a defense organization responsible for protecting public security.</p>

<h3>The United States Formally Announces Acceptance of the Jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice - A First in American History</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 26th] President Truman sent a letter to United Nations Secretary-General Lie, declaring that the United States formally accepts the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. This measure is a first in American history. Johnson, the U.S. representative to the United Nations, also attached a letter stating, "My action today proves that my government is determined to do everything in its power to enable the United Nations to complete its mission. We believe that the development of international law has reached a stage that is sufficient to guide and form the basis of international relations. We further believe that in order to guarantee the continued development of international law and enable it to complete its mission, all disputes that are subject to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice should be submitted to a responsible tribunal for adjudication. It is believed that after the widespread acceptance of the responsibilities of this court, the status of law in international relations will be greatly advanced." Johnson's letter also stated that the International Court of Justice will only hear legal disputes limited to the following four circumstances: (1) Interpretation of treaties, (2) Implementation of international law, (3) Decisions on events that constitute violations of international law, (4) Determining the nature and importance of compensation when violating international obligations. However, it will not apply in the following three situations: (1) If a dispute arises and both parties agree to submit the event to another court, (2) If the dispute is within the judicial scope of the United States, (3) If the dispute is related to multilateral treaty provisions. For the last situation, if all signatory countries and both parties to the dispute are willing to submit to the International Court of Justice, the United States will also agree to submit to the International Court of Justice. The validity period of this agreement is set at five years, and the United States may issue a memorandum within six months after the expiry date to determine whether it remains effective.</p>

<h3>Defendant's Defense Lawyers Cross-Examine Exhaustively: Puyi's Testimony Ends Yesterday: Puppet Emperor Denies Colluding with Japan to Plot Restoration: Judges Allow Him to Leave Tokyo After Deliberation</h3>
<p>[Kaizosha, Tokyo, 27th] Today was the eighth day of the puppet Emperor Puyi's testimony at the Far East International Military Tribunal. For the past eight days, the defense lawyers have repeatedly questioned Puyi, trying to prove that he colluded with the Japanese and voluntarily became a puppet. Puyi, on the other hand, has insisted that he was forced by the Kwantung Army to take the puppet position, that he had not dreamed of restoration beforehand, and that he had even tried to recover lost territory for China afterward, but his heart was willing, but his strength was insufficient. Today, the defense lawyer Okamoto first asked: "Did the witness seek help from the Japanese government to become the Emperor of China again and recover the Forbidden City? Was the witness dissatisfied because his request was rejected by the Japanese?" Puyi replied: "This matter is completely fabricated." The defense lawyer Fujii asked: "When the witness approved decrees, was there a 'Minister of State' to explain them?" Puyi replied, "The explanation was very simple, and I could not express any opposition. Everything was decided by the Kwantung Army." Puyi then testified that the defendant Hoshino, from December 1936 to July 1940, when he served as the "Chief of General Affairs" of Manchukuo, a part of the bureau chiefs of the puppet regime were from the Northeast, and the backbone cadres at the section chief level of the puppet regime also mostly employed people from the Northeast, but</p>
<p>they were all puppets</p>
<p>only. Sakai then asked Puyi who were the Northeastern officials he trusted? At this time, the presiding judge suddenly declared: "This kind of questioning is of no help to the court. What we want to know is whether the witness was a puppet or not. No matter how you cross-examine him, this witness will never overturn his position that he was under Japanese pressure at the time. But whether we believe this witness or not is another matter." Fujii then asked Puyi to give concrete examples to prove that he was under pressure from the Kwantung Army. Puyi replied: "Every move was restricted, how can I list them one by one?" The defense lawyer Fujii also asked Puyi whether he had contacted China to realize the goal of recovering lost territory. Puyi replied: "Because I was under</p>
<p>strict Japanese surveillance</p>
<p>I was unable to make contact." He asked about the organization and funding of the guards who trained the witnesses. Puyi replied: "The guards were composed of Chinese and Mongolians, with slightly more Chinese. The funding was raised by me." Fujii wanted to ask about the freedom of income and expenditure of funds, but the presiding judge rejected it as "irrelevant." Fujii then turned to the opium issue. Puyi testified: "In 1932, a ban on opium was announced in order to reduce smoking, but on the other hand, the planting of opium was encouraged, and the planting volume increased year by year, and laborers and students were forced to engage in planting work. Those who were poisoned were issued permits by the government, so the number increased year by year." Then the defense lawyer Matthias asked: "On November 3, 1931, the witness met with the Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin, Kuwashima. Kuwashima told him that</p>
<p>the Emperor of Japan hoped he would restore</p>
<p>and become emperor in Manchuria. Did the witness express hope for restoration at that time, ask Kuwashima how to restore, what assistance the Japanese government would provide, and how to escape from Tianjin?" Puyi replied: "This matter is entirely fabricated by the Japanese. There is no such fact at all." Matthias then asked: "On November 13, 1931, did the witness not say to Consul-General Kuwashima: "The time for restoration is not yet ripe?" Puyi replied: "There is no such thing." Matthias wanted to continue cross-examining, but was opposed by the chief prosecutor Keenan, so he ended the cross-examination. Puyi testified for eight days and then left the court amidst the clicking of cameras. Then the judges present deliberated and decided to allow Puyi to leave Tokyo.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 27th] When the International Military Tribunal opened today, the defense lawyers continued to cross-examine Puyi, trying to prove that Puyi eagerly pursued the throne of the puppet Manchukuo and fully colluded with Japan. Puyi vehemently argued that his appointment as the puppet emperor was forced by the Japanese army. The presiding judge</p>
<p>Webb expressed impatience</p>
<p>and immediately declared: This kind of testimony has clearly indicated that Puyi was under pressure. The court may end the cross-examination of Puyi. This does not mean that we believe the testimony, because continuing the cross-examination is absolutely useless. The defendant's defense lawyer today wanted to prove that Puyi received an annual salary of 3 million yen from the puppet Manchukuo government, of which 800,000 yen was used as "pocket money." The puppet government also issued 5 million yen in public bonds, and Puyi could receive 150,000 yen in interest annually. The presiding judge Webb stopped him, saying that the question was only whether Puyi was a puppet, and his salary had nothing to do with it.</p>
<h3>Court Plans to Invite Experts to Identify Puyi's Handwriting</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th, United Press] The defense lawyers' sharp pressure on Puyi at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal has prompted the court to consider hiring handwriting experts to prove whether the important documents of "Manchukuo" were written by Puyi, because Puyi claimed that the documents were all fabricated. The defense lawyers confirmed Puyi's handwriting from a fan. Puyi had given this fan to his English teacher Reginald Johnston, who wrote the book "Twilight in the Forbidden City," which describes Puyi's dangerous life. A photo of this fan is printed in the book. The defense lawyers explained that they wanted to prove that the documents of "Manchukuo" were written by Puyi, so the court approved their request. Presiding Judge Webb told the defense lawyers that when the court begins to prove whether Puyi is lying by handwriting, it will need the assistance of handwriting experts. The Japanese defense lawyers today also mentioned another mysterious murder case in the cruel history of "Manchukuo" to the court. Puyi had previously stated that the Japanese had murdered an unfriendly Chinese provincial governor, but he could not provide further proof other than vague evidence. Tojo's defense lawyer, Kiyose Ichiro, said that the Chinese provincial governor was convicted and executed after legal trial procedures. Puyi immediately retorted: Many people died as a result of the atrocities of the Japanese, but the "Manchukuo" trials were only a formality to eliminate the enemies of the Kwantung Army.</p>

<h3>Sun Tianchang's Crimes Established: Decision to Send to Court for Detention and Interrogation: Embezzlement by China Textile Company Staff: Thorough Investigation Based on Secret Reports: Investigation Team to Discuss the Issue of the Working Period</h3>
<p>The original working period for the Clearing and Investigation Team for the Reception Work in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui areas was set at fifty days. Now, the first group of the team has been stationed in Shanghai for more than a month, and several important cases have not yet come to a conclusion. Currently, Committee Member Wu Wangji is traveling to Nanjing to report on the progress of the reception work clearing in Shanghai to Secretary-General Shao Lizi and Deputy Secretary-General Zhen of the Joint Office of the National Clearing and Investigation Teams for Reception Work. He has requested instructions on whether the working period can be extended. It has been learned that Secretary-General Shao replied: The teams in Shanghai and Hangzhou are the busiest and most complicated. There are many enemy and puppet materials in Shanghai, and there are many disputes, so the work is difficult, which is expected. The 50-day deadline is a general rule. If the facts cannot be completed, it is proposed to request careful extension again. It is also a remedial measure to transfer the unfinished cases to the local Supervisory Envoy's Office for continued handling. It is heard that Director Zhang and the committee members will discuss and decide on whether to extend the deadline in the next few days. Regarding the Sun Tianchang case, after review and investigation by the team, it is believed that the crime of aiding the enemy has been formally established. It has now been decided to transfer the case to the court for trial, and the defendant has been handed over to the District Prosecutor's Office for detention. Regarding the warehouse section, Director Zhang will today accompany Committee Members Wu and Zhang to inspect the warehouses received by the Ministry of Military Administration, and will continue to conduct spot checks. Regarding the secret report举报 on the Fourth Municipal Hospital's secret sale of received materials, the investigators of the team stated that there is no factual basis and are currently reviewing the face-to-face investigation report. In addition, there have been three or four secret reports举报 to the team about the internal organization of the China Textile Construction Company of the Ministry of Economic Affairs being unsound and staff members engaging in private embezzlement. It is heard that the team is thoroughly investigating the case in order to obtain the truth. In addition, disputes over real estate and land of educational institutions and schools will be handled by Committee Member Zhang Qingzhen in conjunction with the Land Administration Bureau. Zhang has served in the education sector for more than ten years and attaches great importance to such cases.

<h3>The Guisheng Wheel Wanted to Depart but Stopped Again: Canceled after Customs Clearance: Notice to Retrieve the Loaded Goods: Customs Admits All Losses</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The British Jardine Matheson Shipping Department's Guisheng Wheel, which was loaded with relief supplies from Hong Kong to Qingjin via Shanghai, was canceled after customs clearance on the 26th because it loaded goods and passengers in Shanghai, hindering China's shipping rights, after objections from the Shipowners' Association. The shipping department of the company announced to the customs brokers at 11:30 a.m. yesterday that it would stop loading goods, and those that had already been loaded into the cabin would also have to be retrieved. According to the person in charge of the company, the Guisheng Wheel should have transported relief supplies entrusted by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to Qingjin. The loading of passengers and goods was approved by the customs authorities in advance, so the customs brokers' signing and declaration were approved. When the cargo trucks arrived at the pier, they were also inspected and loaded onto the ship by customs officers, and some of the goods had already been loaded into the cabin. Later, it was heard that there were objections from all parties. For the sake of caution, on Saturday, the authorities were asked for instructions again, and it was specially facilitated, allowing the last shipment. Therefore, before 3:00 p.m. on the 26th, the export procedures for customs clearance and the consulate were completed. Unexpectedly, at around 5:00 p.m., the customs suddenly called and ordered the return of the customs clearance form, and declared that the error of allowing the Guisheng Wheel to load passengers and goods was admitted, and all losses were admitted. The representatives of the customs brokers were greatly surprised when they heard the news. A senior official announced the method: if the goods on the ship and the wharf are not transported away, they can be piled into the Huangpu River, and the stack rent of the Dalian Steamship Warehouses will be recognized by the line. All losses should be described in letters, so that they can be collected and negotiated with the customs. As for the declared customs form, it is not necessary to report for customs refund again, and the form will be changed when loading on other ships, which has also been allowed by the customs. The customs brokers who loaded the Guisheng Wheel held a meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the matter, and the result is unknown. The ship was originally scheduled to sail north this afternoon, but due to the need to unload cargo and re-clear customs, etc., it may not be able to leave the mooring today. Although the passenger tickets have been registered, fortunately they have not been sold, so there is no need to handle ticket refunds. As for the relief supplies loaded in Hong Kong, they still need to be transported to Qingjin for unloading.</p>

<p>The first and second regiments of the 67th Division of our occupation army stationed in Japan arrived in Shanghai from Haiphong on the 5th and 16th of this month, respectively. Division Commander Dai Jian arrived in Shanghai on the 16th of this month. After arriving in Shanghai, Dai went to the division headquarters in Jiangwan that evening to handle important matters. Because the division has decided to go to Japan next month, its directly subordinate units and the second regiment have been ordered to leave Shanghai on the Jiangxing Wheel at 5:00 p.m. yesterday, led by Deputy Division Commander Liu Shenghe, to go to a certain place for training. Once the date for going to Japan is set, they will come to Shanghai to wait for the wheel. The first regiment of the division has been dispatched to Suzhou for garrison duty a few days ago and is now also ordered to assemble for training. The defense of Suzhou will be taken over by the paratroopers. The third regiment is still staying in Haiphong and is also waiting for the wheel to come to Shanghai. As for Division Commander Dai, he will stay in Shanghai for a few days and then return to Nanjing to report his mission. Wang Dazhi of the First Independent Branch of the Garrison Station has been dispatched to Japan at the beginning of next month to be responsible for handling all supply matters for the division in the occupied area.</p>
<h3>Tea Industry Association Hosts Journalists, Reports on the Truth about Tea Loans: Rumors of Misconduct Are Groundless: Hopes That the Government Will Continue to Offer Loans</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The China Tea Industry Association hosted the local press at the Hong Kong Road Bank Association yesterday. Chairman Mai Jingwei reported on the details of the tea loans, saying: After a long period of resistance against Japan, the tea industry in our country has been suspended for a long time. After the victory, farmers and businesses lacked funds to engage in production or manufacturing. Therefore, various tea industry groups in the city applied to the Executive Yuan and the Four Joint Offices for loans of 20 billion yuan. Subsequently, the Four Joint Offices approved tea loans of 7 billion yuan for Zhejiang and Anhui provinces. The allocation amount: 1.8 billion yuan for the Qihong area, 1.5 billion yuan for the Tunlu area, 2.2 billion yuan for the Pinglu area, 500 million yuan for Wenzhou, 500 million yuan for Longjing, and 500 million yuan for other areas. The loan targets are limited to tea factories in the producing areas. The method is: (1) The member companies and firms of the Shanghai Tea Export Association list self-operated, joint-operated and specially-contracted tea factories, and fill in the number of tea boxes manufactured, the amount of funds and the amount of loans required, and send them to the China Agricultural Bank for approval. (2) The tea factories applying for loans need to be guaranteed by members of the Shanghai Tea Export Association for repayment, and the tea money will be directly lent to the tea factories by the local branches of the China Agricultural Bank, and a loan contract will be signed. Three parties are required to provide joint guarantees, and the guarantor must stamp the contract to prove it. The procedures are very detailed and strict. Recent reports in a certain newspaper that tea loans have been embezzled are unfounded and have no basis. The China Agricultural Bank will also issue a statement on this matter. It is also stated that although the tea loan was approved for 7 billion yuan, only 5.27 billion yuan was actually lent. If the cost of purchasing rough tea in various regions this year is calculated, an average of 140,000 to 150,000 yuan is required per dan. Therefore, the tea loan funds are only enough to purchase more than 30,000 dan of rough tea. In fact, the amount of rough tea purchased by various factories, Pinglu and Tunlu areas has been about 30,000 to 40,000 dan each, and a part of it has been refined into boxes. The Qihong area has refined more than 20,000 boxes, and the cost per box is more than 200,000 yuan. Therefore, the total amount of rough tea cheated in various regions has exceeded the amount of tea loans by several times. This can also prove that the saying that tea loans are embezzled is impossible. Tea merchants Wang Zenghuan and Tang Jisan also talked about the tea industry's crisis, which is still very serious. Because after the exchange rate increased, the price of American tea is still only 1,400 to 1,500 yuan per pound, while the domestic cost is more than 3,000 yuan per pound. Therefore, new tea has not been exported yet. We urgently hope that the government will quickly handle export subsidies to strive for the international market, and continue to allocate refining loans and second tea loans. Finally, Chairman Shou proposed to request the government to exempt or reduce the 10% general tax revenue. Wang Zhenshi also proposed to increase domestic sales, relying on the assistance of transportation and the improvement of manufacturing. He hoped that the industry could learn from Taiwan's roasting methods to strive for export status. The meeting adjourned at 4:30.</p>
<h3>China Agricultural Bank Announces the Process of Handling Tea Loans</h3>
<p>The China Agricultural Bank also announced the process of handling tea loans, saying: "Recently, there have been news reports in the newspapers about the bank's spring tea loans that are not consistent with the facts. In order to make the public understand the truth, the bank specially publishes the details of the tea loan process as follows: According to this year's spring tea loans in the southeastern region, the government approved the plan and handed it over to the bank for handling. The handling situation: (1) The loan targets are tea farms or tea factories in various producing areas (a total of more than 200), with Shanghai tea merchants as repayment guarantors. The Southeastern Regional Farm and Factory Federation and the Tea Export Association jointly conduct preliminary review and introduction, and then the bank approves the loan amount according to the production situation in each region, and signs an agreement with the tea merchants in Shanghai who guarantee repayment. (2) All loans are signed with local farms and factories in various producing areas such as Tunxi, Shaoxing, and Wenzhou according to the agreement, and loans are made locally. (3) The government approved a total of 7 billion yuan in tea loans. The bank approved a total of 6.1 billion yuan in tea loans based on the production situation of various farms and factories. Except for the fact that local farms and factories have automatically given up due to poor exports and operating difficulties, the total amount actually lent is 5.2 billion yuan. (4) Farms and factories that receive loans should store the purchased tea leaves as collateral. According to reports from various branches in Shanghai, the amount of rough tea purchased by manufacturers in various regions exceeds the amount of loans. During this spring's mission, the transportation in various producing areas was extremely difficult, but in order to adapt to the situation and help tea farmers, the bank, with the assistance of the Central Bank, disregarded all difficulties and tried its best to transfer cash to prepare for the purchase of tea leaves by factories in various places. At the same time, the local branches in the producing areas reviewed the situation of local farms and factories according to the agreement, made loans separately, and sent auditors to patrol and supervise at any time. Looking at the tea purchase process of various farms and factories that obtained loans, it has benefited the tea farmers' economy a lot. Now the loans have gradually matured. Because the overseas tea market is sluggish, the bank is trying its best to assist its exports.</p>
<h3>Siren Will Sound Tonight: Citizens Don't Panic</h3>
<p>The sirens in various places in the Huangpu District have been installed and will be officially taken over and controlled by the Huangpu Police Department at 8:00 p.m. today, and a test will be held. The sirens will sound for five minutes in various places. The police department specially notified stores and residents in the district not to panic at that time. It is also learned that the Lujiazui and Changshu districts will also be installed within the month, and all districts in the city will be fully installed by the end of the year.</p>
<h3>Mountain Lord Becomes a Canary: Tiger Acts as a Living Advertisement</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] "Are there any tigers in Shanghai now?" After hearing this sentence, you must think of the zoos in the two parks, right? However, after the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, the birds and beasts in the zoo have all suffered disasters. Even the only tiger in Fuxing Park died of lung disease. After passing Fuxing Road on a moonlit night, I have not heard the low roar of a tiger from the trees for a long time!</p>
<p>However, there is still one surviving tiger in Shanghai. When he first came to Shanghai, he was only four months old and weighed only twenty pounds. Now he is fourteen years old and weighs more than two hundred pounds. If he were still in the deep mountains and old forests, he would have learned to eat people! However, his current environment makes him very docile and the owner also takes good care of him. He is given nine pounds of beef and fifteen eggs every day! Because he is well raised, his fur is very shiny. The once roaring "Mountain Lord" has become a "Canary" that pleases people. His owner also gave him a beautiful name, "Flower". When he hears someone call "Flower", he will gently raise his head. However, if mischievous people hit the edge of the cage with iron bars, he will still roar - but he cannot rush out, because there is no need for a door</p>
<p>there. If you also want to see him, I can tell you his address. He is in the Simingtang Pharmacy downstairs in the Zhongnan Hotel on Zhongzheng Middle Road (formerly Aiduya Road). His owner is Lao Yi, the owner of Simingtang. Now, Flower is the living trademark of Simingtang. In the future, Flower's remains will probably be used to make tiger bone papaya wine.</p>

<h3>Yu Xiang Is Under Strict Interrogation: Request for Bail Is Rejected</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In the 120 million yuan embezzlement case of the Materials Office of the Two Roads Bureau, the case has become very clear since the heroine, Yu Xiang, the wife of Zhang Hongtu, the director of the Materials Office, was brought to justice for investigation. The prosecution will be filed in the near future. The night before last, when Yu was being interrogated, she requested bail from the court. The prosecutor reprimanded her for not surrendering to the court after coming to Shanghai. This time, the Two Roads Bureau has an official document to transfer her to the District Prosecutor's Office. Yu's application was rejected. The director's wife is now being held in the women's prison on Masinan Road.</p>
<h3>Milk Powder Trademark Changed: Two People Released After Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the case of the U.S.-produced "Ronnip" brand milk powder with altered trademarks, it is now based on a letter from the company's representative bank: it is declared that the factory originally cabled: "Now ask your bank (referring to Tiancheng) to re-label the up brand milk powder and change it to the brand required by your bank". The facts do not violate criminal law. As for Lin Songnian and Wang Zongkang, who were arrested, they were released after the police station clarified the above situation.</p>
<h3>Eight Rong Case Kidnappers Executed; Two Accomplices Sentenced to Eight Years; Zhan Rongpei and Others Declared Innocent</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The judgment of the Rong Desheng kidnapping case has been fully approved by the Ministry of National Defense via telegram the night before last. The principal offenders Luo Wenqing, Yuan Zhongshu, Wu Zhigang, Zheng Liantang, Huang Shaoyin, Zhao Shaozong, Zhu Chansheng, and Liu Ruibiao, eight in total, were sentenced to death with permanent deprivation of civil rights. They were escorted to Song Park execution grounds and executed by firing squad at 7:00 AM yesterday. Accomplices Luo Weiquan and Zhu Liansheng were sentenced to seven years of imprisonment with seven years of deprivation of civil rights, and are currently detained in the Tilanqiao Prison. Zhan Rongpei, Wu Jiyun, Gu Chushi, Chen Zhihe, and Chen Luo Shi, five in total, were declared innocent. However, they must still undergo formal approval procedures from the military law authorities, and therefore must post bail before they can be released.</p>
<p>To prevent any unexpected incidents during the execution of Luo Wenqing and the other eight convicts, the Garrison Headquarters exerted utmost effort to maintain secrecy beforehand. The chief examiner of the case, Section Chief Zhu, rose at 6:00 AM yesterday morning and brought forth the eight convicts from the detention center. He informed them that they were being executed by order and asked if they had any last words. Yuan Zhongshu said, "There is nothing else. It's just that my son is also currently imprisoned, and the younger one is only ten years old. I request that they be released to collect my body." Luo Wenqing similarly requested the release of his son Luo Binggen. Wu Zhigang remained silent, and the others also appeared dazed. Around 7:00 AM, nurses injected them with anesthesia, and then they were transported in two prison vans to Song Park execution grounds and executed by firing squad. According to the execution supervisor, who spoke to reporters afterwards, Luo Wenqing was already staggering and unable to walk when he arrived at the execution grounds.</p>
<p>The reasons for acquitting Zhan Rongpei and others in the judgment are as follows:</p>
<p>The crime of kidnapping for ransom, if one negotiates the ransom during the kidnapping process, although it can be considered as aiding and abetting the crime, it requires the intention to assist in the crime. If there is no intention to commit the principal offense and no contact with the kidnappers, merely acting as a family member of the kidnapped person to negotiate the ransom with the bandits, it is still difficult to consider it as aiding and abetting the crime of extortion. There is a precedent in the Supreme Court's ruling No. 1092 (Shang Zi) of the 22nd year of the Republic. Zhan Rongpei is the manager of Shenxin Factories No. 2 and No. 5 and has a very deep friendship with Rong Erren, the son of Rong Desheng. Rong's son entrusted Zhan Rongpei to negotiate the ransom in order to rescue his father, and Wu Zhigang took advantage of his relationship with Zhan, with whom he co-operated on the Hua Da Enterprise Company, to proceed with the negotiation. He had no intention of contacting the bandits, which Yuan Zhongshu and Wu Zhigang have admitted. The fact that he was entrusted by the family of the kidnapped person to negotiate the ransom has also been repeatedly stated and confirmed by Rong Desheng's son, Rong Erren, in his statements and evidence. Since there is no criminal act, an acquittal should be pronounced.</p>
<p>Although Gu Chushi is related to Yuan Zhongshu through marriage (daughter-in-law) and is Yuan's landlord, he had no intention of participating in the crime nor did he receive any share of the stolen money. Yuan Zhongshu has already confessed this. As for the 300,000 legal tender lent to Yuan, it has been verified that it was a loan before the Rong case kidnapping, and it has nothing to do with this case. The 500 US dollars and 300,000 legal tender found in his house were secretly hidden by Yuan's apprentice, Zhao Gaofu, which Yuan Zhongshu has confessed in his statement. Zhao Gaofu is still being pursued but has not yet been apprehended.</p>
<p>Wu Jiyun's younger sister, Wu Yuesheng, was kidnapped by Huang Ashi and made a concubine during the period of enemy occupation. Wu Jiyun runs a sailing business and resides in Shanghai. Although he had dealings with Huang, there is no factual evidence of his participation in the conspiracy.</p>
<p>Chen Luo Shi is Luo Wenqing's younger sister, and Chen Zhihe has lived with Chen Luo Shi for many years. Luo Wenqing deposited 3,000 US dollars of his share of the loot in his sister Chen Luo Shi's home. After the case occurred, these two were implicated and arrested.</p>
<h3>Wujin Fellow Townsmen Association Public Memorial for Qian Mingshan</h3>
<p>Mr. Qian Mingshan of Wujin, a famous scholar of the late Qing Dynasty, submitted memorials criticizing the government, retired to the countryside, and devoted himself to disaster relief and rescue of the people. Mr. Qian was a Confucian master of his generation. His poetry, lyrics, and calligraphy were all admired by his contemporaries. People south of the Yangtze River are universally familiar with the name "Ge You Lao Ren." When the enemy army invaded, Mr. Qian hid in Shanghai, his integrity surpassing worldly concerns. Sadly, he passed away in September the year before last due to deep concern for the times, unable to witness the celebration of the unification of China. The Wujin Fellow Townsmen Association and the Jigui Alumni Association, commemorating the second anniversary of Mr. Qian's passing after the victory, have specially initiated a public memorial to be held tomorrow (the 29th) from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM at No. 6, Lane 102, Tongfu Road (between Weihaiwei Road and Fuxu Road) to commemorate him.</p>
<h3>Postal Truck Causes Major Accident; Two Dead, Four Injured</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A parcel delivery truck (license plate number 1766) from the Sichuan Road Post Office Headquarters, as usual, was driven by the driver Wan A Si to various post offices at 6:00 AM every morning to load parcels. Yesterday morning, the truck was returning from the 27th Post Office in Wujiaochang to the Headquarters when, upon reaching Fanhua Du Road and Kaina Road, the steel plate broke, and the Weirpan failed. At the same time, the brakes were damaged, making it impossible for the driver to control the vehicle. The truck went straight ahead, first overturning a pedicab, injuring both the passenger and the driver. Then it ran onto the sidewalk and knocked over a bread stall. It continued to drive to No. 94 Fanhua Du Road, near the donation office of the Bureau of Finance, killing two pedestrians and seriously injuring two others. After the Jiangning Sub-bureau sent police to investigate, it was learned that one of the deceased was named Zhang Chiliang, and the other's surname and given name are unknown. Three people were seriously injured and one person was slightly injured in the incident. The driver, Wan A Si, who caused the accident, along with witness Chen Wenbin (who ran a soda stall at the intersection of Kaina Road), were taken to the bureau for interrogation and reported to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.</p>
<h3>Egerton's Remarks: UNRRA Relief Plan to Be Completed as Soon as Possible; Expected Not to Be Completed by the End of March Next Year; Embargoed Materials Have in Fact Been Lifted Item by Item</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The new Director of the UNRRA Office in China, Lieutenant General Egerton, hosted a reception for reporters at the Capital Hotel yesterday morning, which was also attended by the Acting Director, Mr. Lai. Mr. Egerton stated that he had recently arrived in China and had limited knowledge of the work of the UNRRA Office in China and the situation in China. UNRRA's mission is arduous, and the scope of relief needed in China is so vast that difficulties are inevitable. He had heard about these difficulties in Washington. He expressed his satisfaction with the efforts of UNRRA staff under these circumstances. In the future, within the limits of what the situation permits, he will complete UNRRA's post-war relief plan as soon as possible. He also expressed his gratitude to people from all walks of life for their concern for UNRRA. Then, Mr. Deng Shuxun, who served as the translator, introduced each reporter to Mr. Egerton, and the press conference concluded. After the meeting, when Mr. Egerton answered reporters' questions, he said that he had not received official news about whether UNRRA would announce its termination as scheduled by the end of March next year. Based on general observations, he expected that the termination could be postponed. Regarding the cancellation of the embargo, Mr. Egerton stated that the situation is gradually improving, and the various materials under embargo have in fact been lifted item by item.</p>
<h3>Robbery of Shantytowns in Pudong; Three Thieves Arrested and Confess</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In the area around Yinxianggang Maqiao on Xinshi Street, Yangshupu, Pudong, robberies by bandits have been occurring frequently, victimizing the residents of shantytowns. Wang Xinheng, the head of the Yangshupu Police Sub-bureau, specifically ordered Xu Shibin, the head of the Second Unit, to investigate. On the morning of the 25th, detectives Zhang Yunsheng and Ji Bingquan learned that firearms were buried in the wasteland along the Huangpu River near Guangxin Pier on Guangxin Road within their jurisdiction. The police officers went to excavate and found five homemade Mauser bullets. With this clue, they predicted that bandits would come. Therefore, they dispatched disguised police to stay and wait. As expected, at dusk that day, one person arrived and lingered for a long time before trying to leave. They were immediately apprehended and strictly interrogated. He confessed that he was Xiong Jinglin from Anhui and that he had accomplices, including Chen Jiabao, who lived in a bungalow on Longjiang Road. They then rushed to that address and arrested Chen. Chen then confessed that Gao Yongman was hiding in a bungalow at the junction of that road. They continued to arrest Gao. Under preliminary interrogation, they admitted to robbing Fei Huamin's home at No. 5 Ma Yushan Road, as well as four or five other shantytowns one after another in the Zhao Jiazhai area of Huangxing Road. They also admitted that they had a small Mauser rifle that they brought from Anhui, which had been sold by Li Guoshan, who lives in Yiren Lane on Yangshupu Road. Therefore, the sub-bureau is continuing its investigation.</p>
<h3>Whether Horse Racing at the Racecourse Can Resume; Must Be Submitted to the Municipal Council for Discussion</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] There has been much discussion about the proposal to resume horse racing at the racecourse in this city. According to the person in charge of studying the plan, it is believed that in the current situation of the city government's economic constraints, resuming horse racing may not be a way to increase revenue. And given the rampant speculation in the city, horse racing may not be a legitimate form of entertainment. In the long term, if the city government's finances are once abundant, the racecourse can be bought and developed as a park for the entertainment of all citizens, which would be even more ideal. Although the above opinions have been repeatedly considered, they still need to be approved by the upcoming City Council before they can be realized.</p>
<h3>Su Chengde and Pan Yangyao to Be Sentenced This Morning</h3>

His crimes are obvious, and the High Court is scheduled to pronounce sentence at 9:30 AM this morning.</p>
<p>Also, Pan Yangyao, the former Secretary of the Four Banks Savings Association and the Chairman of "Yongfeng Bank" in Shanghai during the enemy and pseudo-regime period, will also be sentenced this morning.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Involving Failure to Deliver on Fixed Order</h3>
<p>Hua Ying Company States Its Case</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] This newspaper has reported twice on a lawsuit involving a dispute between the Hua Ying Enterprise Company of this city and the Lian Ying Company regarding a fixed order for goods. According to Chiang Lu-tang, the general manager of Hua Ying Company, who told reporters yesterday, the company had signed a contract with Qin Sibao, the manager of Lian Ying Company, on January 14 of this year to order 1,000 rolls of Pabco roofing felt from the United States for a price of US$5,502.27, agreeing to deliver the goods before the end of March of this year. If the goods could not be shipped and delivered by then, the entire loan should be refunded at that time. A deposit of US$825 was paid at the time of signing the contract. On February 18, the Central Bank remitted US$4,677.27 to the United States, and the entire payment was cleared at that time. However, Qin Sibao claimed that the payment was delayed, and the delivery of the goods would also have to be delayed by five weeks. Hua Ying had no objection. Later, Qin Sibao claimed that the goods had been shipped from the United States on the Sea Belenng and showed a telegram. Unexpectedly, months passed without any news. On July 13, Qin Sibao again said that the goods could be shipped on August 17, but when asked what the name of the ship was, he evaded answering. Hua Ying made an appointment to meet with him, but he avoided meeting altogether. On July 22, they filed a complaint with the Huangpu Sub-bureau, requesting his arrest to prevent him from escaping. An immediate settlement was reached at the police station, and Qin Sibao promised to refund the payment. Qin immediately issued a check No. A378423 from the American Da Li Bank dated August 22 with a face value of 2,085,000 legal tender, and stated in the mediation that he "will never notify the bank to stop payment of the check." However, when Hua Ying Company went to pay on time, the check was dishonored. They then filed another complaint accusing Qin Sibao of setting up a false business and fraudulently obtaining property. The general manager stated that this spring, the market price of roofing felt in Shanghai was 70,000 per roll. If this shipment of 1,000 rolls could be delivered on time, the value would be 70 million. By only demanding the refund of the payment of 2,085,000 from Qin Sibao, the company has already suffered a huge loss. In addition to this batch of roofing felt, Hua Ying Company also ordered 65 barrels of "roofing felt asphalt," 200 tons of cement, and 1,200 raincoats from Qin Sibao, and the payments were all made several months ago. Qin Sibao has not delivered any goods.</p>
<h3>Beware of Pickpockets; Fourteen Types of Pickpocketing Techniques; "Technical" Grand Performance; Quick-Eyed and Nimble-Handed, Better Than Shi Qian</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In Shanghai, whether you are sitting on a tram or walking on the street, there is one very important thing you must never forget. That sentence is: "Pay attention to your clothes and belongings!"</p>
<p>There are more than four million people in Shanghai. These many people have all sorts of different occupations. Logically, it is naturally easier for those with quick eyes and nimble hands to find a job. However, quite a few people rely on their "quick eyes and nimble hands" to do "business without capital." They follow in the footsteps of Shi Qian, the Drum on the Water from the Water Margin, and learn to be thieves!</p>
<p>In the busiest Lao Zha District, the police station has to catch dozens of "pickpocket gangs" every week. After they are caught, their heads are shaved so that others can easily recognize them. But pickpocketing is not a major crime, so the punishment is often very light. Usually, they are only detained for a week or ten days, and then they are released. After they come out, they often lack the means to make a living, so many of them continue in their old profession.</p>
<p>The Lao Zha Sub-bureau has recently caught 52 thieves in the past week, including two girls, one 16-year-old named Wang Meidi and one 18-year-old named Chen Aizhen. Among these people, the oldest is 57 years old, named Lu Yulin, and the youngest is Bi Hongbin, who is only 14 years old this year!</p>
<p>Yesterday, in order to promote public awareness, the police station held a grand performance of pickpocketing techniques in the open space of the bureau. Four "players" selected from these 52 people demonstrated. It turned out that there are more than a dozen ways to pickpocket. They are now listed one by one below: (1) "Pushing the Rickshaw": Two people work together. One person blocks the rickshaw in front, and when the rickshaw stops, the person in the back tries to snatch things from the rickshaw. (2) "Chasing the Vegetable Buyers": Specifically stealing vegetable money or even fish and meat from the baskets of people buying vegetables. (3) "Running on Flat Ground": Three or four people work together. One sells socks and shirts on a street stall, attracting villagers to watch and taking the opportunity to pickpocket. (4) "Breaking In": Under the pretext of asking for directions, breaking into people's homes and stealing odds and ends of clothing. (5) "Surrounding the Tram": Pickpocketing when tram passengers are crowded, especially when getting on and off. Sometimes shouting "Watch out for your money" on the tram, causing passengers to unconsciously press on the pockets where they hide their money, allowing them to pinpoint the location and take action at any time. (6) "Tossing the Hat": Also known as "Catching the Turtle," i.e., snatching hats. (7) "Picking Up Trash": Seeing someone with money bulging out of their pocket, one person bumps into them from the front, and another person takes action. (8) "Cutting the Bag": Specifically stealing things carried on the back of bicycles. (9) "Ground Pickpocketing": Pedestrians carrying items, when tired, place their belongings on the ground to rest briefly. The pickpocket takes advantage of their unpreparedness to quietly steal them. (10) "Dropping the Bag": A pickpocket throws a fake gold ornament on the ground. After a greedy villager picks it up, another person immediately catches up and negotiates with them, insisting on getting back a little money before giving up. (11) "Switching the Package": Selling fabrics and other items on the street at low prices, taking advantage of the haggling to replace the real items with cotton wadding or straw. (12) "Quick Drawing": Stealing pens with quick movements. (13) "Steady Wind": Picking pockets when pedestrians are watching a lively event. (14) "Moving Wind": Taking action when pedestrians are walking and not paying attention.</p>
<p>There are many well-dressed individuals among the pickpocket gangs. These people have another name, called "Generals." There are many such "Generals" in Shanghai, leading their subordinates and roaming freely in the bizarre and colorful metropolis of Shanghai!</p>

<h3>Our Newspaper Hosts Feast for Advertising Agents; Expiration Date of August Grand Giveaway; Selected Impartially and Sealed, to Be Revealed at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>Our newspaper's President Pan and General Manager Chen hosted a banquet at the Shanghai Restaurant on Gordon Road last night for advertising agents, with over 40 people in attendance. During the banquet, President Pan gave a speech: "I hope that all agents will continue to cooperate with our newspaper in the spirit of the past, and work together for the cause of journalism in the New China." At the same time, because the second joint grand giveaway organized by major factories and shops in August will soon expire, the special imprint date should be impartially selected immediately, so that it can be revealed at the end of the month. Therefore, following the precedent of July, 31 cards with different dates were prepared in advance, each card representing one day, as well as 31 blank envelopes. The cards were sealed into the envelopes one by one in public. Five guests each selected one envelope, and then Mr. Liu Jingchuan picked one envelope from the five. The date contained in that envelope would be the winning date. The winning envelope was signed by the guests, and then it, together with the remaining 30 envelopes, were placed in a specially made wooden box, which was secured with three copper locks of different constructions. Mr. Liu Jingchuan, Mr. Lu Dongsheng, and our newspaper each kept a key. The mouth of the box was sealed and signed, and it will be unsealed together at 4:00 PM on the 31st of this month, revealed the next day, to show impartiality. During the banquet, the guests and hosts exchanged toasts and chatted merrily. They dispersed after enjoying themselves until about 10:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Repaying Kindness with Enmity: Jiangxi Woman Meets the Wrong Person</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yu Naijin, a local man, 25 years old, raised funds and went to Shangrao, Jiangxi to trade tobacco leaves last February. Unfortunately, he encountered thieves midway and was robbed clean, leaving him stranded in a foreign land. Cheng Fusheng, who runs a rice store there, took pity on his loneliness and helplessness, and because of his talent, he took him in. Yu was also quite self-aware and soon became the store's accountant. Unexpectedly, a month later, Cheng fell ill and died, and on his deathbed, he entrusted his wife, son, and daughter to Yu's care. By February of this year, Cheng's wife was also seriously ill. Knowing that she would not recover, she summoned Yu and her biological daughter, Suqing (23 years old), to her bedside and explained that her son was adopted. Therefore, she intended to marry her daughter to Yu. By this time, the two of them were already in love. Soon after, Cheng's wife passed away, and Yu took care of the funeral arrangements, fulfilling his duties well. Cheng's adopted son knew that he was not Cheng's biological son, so the siblings often quarreled. In April, Yu and the daughter were officially engaged. In order to show his goodwill to his older brother, he decided to hand over the operation of the rice store to him. He immediately instructed the daughter to pack all her private savings, five taels of gold jewelry, 1.8 million legal tender, 300 silver dollars, and valuable fur clothes into four large boxes and leave Shangrao for Shanghai. She arrived at the North Station yesterday morning. Who knew that Yu, with his human face and beast's heart, suddenly had a bad idea. He pretended to go to a friend's place at No. 147 on Fourth Malu Road to arrange accommodation, but he carried away the suitcases and never returned. The woman waited until 6:00 PM without seeing him. She hired a rickshaw to inquire at No. 147 on Fourth Malu Road, only to be told that there was no such person. She couldn't help but feel sad and burst into tears. Later, she was accompanied to the Huangpu Sub-bureau to report the incident and request an investigation.</p>
<h3>Xu Longhu Demands Wife to Leave Rickshaw; Gets Angry and Commits Assault</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Rickshaw puller Xu Longhu, residing in a shack on Huiwen Road, Zhabei, took a fancy to a young woman, Tang Jinmei (30+ years old), last December and brought two children. They used to live peacefully, but recently, due to the hot weather and sluggish rickshaw business, life became difficult. At about 2:00 AM yesterday, Xu suggested to Tang to unconditionally stop pulling the rickshaw. Tang refused, insisting on a certain amount of subsidy. Xu retorted, and an argument ensued. Then, out of anger, Xu took a fruit knife and stabbed Tang twice in the left face and three times in the throat. Blood flowed profusely, and she collapsed. Seeing the great disaster he had caused, Xu fled without a trace. Later, neighbors heard the cries and arrived, reporting to the North Station Sub-bureau, which dispatched police to rush to the scene. However, the murderer had already disappeared. Tang was then taken to Hongren Hospital for treatment, and it is said that her life is in danger.</p>

<h3>Boiled Water Turns Out to Be a Magical Medicine; Wu Zhihui Gradually Recovers Health</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After the news of Mr. Wu Zhihui's indisposition was released a few days ago, many people expressed their concern. Now, people who care about Mr. Wu's health can rest assured because Zhi Lao's fever has subsided and he can sit up and write. The reason for Zhi Lao's illness this time was that he gave a speech at Jiaotong University on a day when the weather was over 100 degrees. Although it was a "scorching sun", Zhi Lao's interest was very high, and he spoke a lot. He went in the morning and didn't return home until four or five in the afternoon. Zhi Lao has always been a vegetarian and once said that his only "nutrition" is to take a nap after lunch every day. That day, because he returned home a little late, he didn't get to take a nap - so he felt dizzy and had some heatstroke symptoms, and his fever also rose.</p>
<p>However, he still insisted on his consistent style, not seeking medical advice, not taking medicine, and not even agreeing to his nephews and nieces' request that he take some pills. During his illness, he only slept a lot and drank some boiled water. One day, his condition was very serious, but "good people are hard to kill," and boiled water turned out to be a magical medicine, and he gradually recovered.</p>
<p>Now Zhi Lao's fever has subsided, but his body still feels weak. He has started sitting up and writing again in the past few days, because he receives a lot of mail, so he often writes seven or eight pieces in a row. Others see that he is mentally exhausted and his wrist strength is not as good as before, and ask him to rest for a few days before writing again, but Zhi Lao still wields his brush with illness - the reason is for livelihood issues!</p>
<h3>Interesting Interlude at U.S. Military Tribunal: Japanese Lawyer Uses Gestures to Instruct Witness, Prosecutor's Accusation Sparks Side Debate</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The trial of U.S. pilot Major Holcomb, who was murdered by the Japanese army in Hong Kong, continued yesterday morning, with the defendant, Lieutenant Colonel Kubo, still providing testimony. An interesting interlude occurred in court when Chief Prosecutor Dewey accused Japanese defense attorney M. Kumoshiro of using gestures to instruct the witness, sparking a side debate between the two parties that brought the case to a standstill. The reason for this was that when Dewey was questioning the witness, his standing position conveniently blocked the view between the defense table and the witness stand. After the defense brought this to the court's attention, Dewey declared that his position was intended to prevent Kumoshiro from instructing the witness with nods and hand gestures. Kumoshiro stood up to deny the accusation, claiming that his small movements were due to the inaccuracy of the interpreter's translations, causing him to express agitation, and requested that Dewey's accusation be removed from the record, fearing it might prejudice the defendant during future court reviews. Another defense attorney, Major Bohr, made the same request and asked the court to limit the prosecutor's questions. After deliberation, the judges rejected the defense's request but declared that they would ensure the prosecutor's questions remained relevant to the topic. The trial continued, but with the defense still expressing strong dissatisfaction, Dewey voluntarily moved to a more distant location. In summary, Kubo testified very little yesterday. The prosecutor asked whether the sinking of Holcomb's plane, shot down by anti-aircraft fire and crashed into a sunken ship, would also constitute a crime, but Kubo's answer was evasive and indecisive.</p>

Over ten thousand people attended the solemn ceremony. All agencies, groups, and schools took a day off, and the city flew county flags.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday was Confucius' Birthday and Teachers' Day. All sectors of the city flew national flags to celebrate and took a day off in commemoration. In addition, various educational organizations, under the leadership of the mayor, held solemn Confucius worship ceremonies and Teachers' Day celebrations at the Confucius Temple in the South City and the City Gymnasium. At exactly 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Mayor Wu Kuo-chen arrived punctually at the Confucius Temple in the South City, proclaiming: "This is the first temple visit after the war. Two years before the war, when I served as Mayor of Hankou, I visited the Confucius Temple once. However, the two occasions are vastly different. Shanghai's Confucius Temple has been ravaged by the war and is in ruins. I fear Hankou cannot be an exception."</p>
<p>At 9:30, the ritual began. Mayor Wu, over his suit, put on a blue robe and black jacket and slowly stepped into the Hall of Great Achievement, standing in the position of the chief officiant. Ancient music filled the hall, played by the National Music Research Association, led by Sun Yude, performing the "Confucius Worship Song." The assistant officiants included Wang Rucang, chief secretary of the Education Bureau; Xu Zexiang, director of the Public Education Center; and Shao Xinshi, director of the Fourth District, standing on both sides. Chen Nian was in charge of ceremony. After Mayor Wu offered incense three times, Zheng Yufeng, director of the Public Education Center, respectfully read the ritual text, which stated: "Great is Confucius! The sage of timeliness. Virtue comparable to heaven and earth, doctrine surpassing ancient and modern times, enduring like mountains and rivers, ever-bright like the sun and moon, traveling among the states, compiling and editing the Six Classics, setting the standard, establishing this model, saving the world and bringing it to governance, ascending to Great Harmony to celebrate peace. Great is Confucius! The teacher of myriad ages, the sacrifices are forever fragrant, with steaming and offerings, may he come and descend, I humbly entreat." After reading, the entire assembly bowed three times to Confucius' spirit tablet. Accompanied by the "March" played by the orphanage band, the entire assembly retreated into the Hall of Great Achievement.</p>
<p>After leaving the Confucius Temple, Mayor Wu rushed to the City Gymnasium on Avenue Albert to preside over the Teachers' Day celebration. Participants included Chen Dongyuan, special inspector of the Ministry of Education; Wang Rucang, chief secretary of the Education Bureau; Zhou Feicheng, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters; Cao Jun, secretary-general of the Youth Corps; and over a thousand representatives from primary and secondary schools. The platform was set up in the center of the gymnasium, with the slogan "Silently remember, learn without satiety, teach without weariness, what is there in this for me?" pasted on the wall. After performing the rituals, Chairman Wu, the Mayor, delivered a speech, roughly stating: "Teachers are the most effective force in the nation-building process. Whether a country is on the right track depends entirely on its teachers. Why is Confucius' birthday designated as Teachers' Day? Because Confucius is the greatest teacher in the world. Confucius' greatness lies in: (1) He has the ideal of reforming society, (2) He has a spirit of uncompromisingness in everything, (3) He upholds the doctrine of the mean throughout his life." Mayor Wu also said: "Teachers must learn Confucius' virtues, lead by example, demand of oneself before demanding of others, and be uncompromising oneself before asking others to be uncompromising. If everyone has this determination, I firmly believe that the Republic of China will be able to get on the right track." Next, Inspector Chen Dongyuan expressed three reflections: "(1) To celebrate Teachers' Day, we must first remember the great teacher Confucius, because Confucius is not only a model for the Chinese people but is also admired by people all over the world, (2) Learn Confucius' spirit of 'knowing that it cannot be done and yet doing it' and 'not knowing that old age is coming,' express ideals, and never give up, (3) Be as full of ideals as Confucius. The greatest merit of a teacher is to influence students with one's own ideals." Inspector Chen also said: "Confucius was born in 551 BC, 2497 years ago, so the year after next will be the 2500th anniversary of Confucius' great birth. When Hu Shih and others were in the United States, they were already preparing a grand commemorative event... at that time, there will be a great celebration. In these three years, we should double our efforts for education." Chief Secretary Wang Ru of the Education Bureau, Zhu Junyang, director of the National Education Department, Xie Enhao, acting director of the Secondary Education Department, and others followed, with many words of encouragement. The meeting adjourned after 12 noon.</p>
<h3>Japan Adopts New Textbooks. New Geography Textbook Also Published</h3>
<p>[Kaikosha, Tokyo, 27th] According to an announcement by General MacArthur's headquarters on the 22nd, the new textbooks for Japanese national and secondary schools have been almost entirely completed and have begun printing and distribution for use starting in the new semester in September. Looking at the new geography textbook, the paper is crude, the binding is in the style of a small booklet, there are no maps or illustrations, and the appearance is simple and crude. The content is quite progressive, emphasizing scientific thought and methods, allowing students to understand the relationship between local customs and history when studying geography, while also emphasizing the spirit of peace. The first lesson of the old geography textbook for the fifth grade, "Look at the map of Japan, no matter how you look at it, its shape is always extraordinary," had a strong subjective tone. The new textbook says, "Our country is an island nation in the eastern Pacific Ocean on the Asian continent, made up of large and small islands," which is far more objective than the former. It is said that this new textbook is still of a temporary nature, and the Ministry of Education is continuing to conduct research on fundamental revisions.</p>

Finally, Deputy District Chief Lian gave instructions, encouraging the Pao-Chia Cadres to be honest and law-abiding and to adjust at any time, hoping that everyone would pay attention.</p>
<h3>Ding Shanming Resigns Concurrent Positions</h3>
<p>Ding Shanming, the head of the 20th Bao of the 26th District (Longhua), having been elected as a municipal senator of this city, and finding his public and private affairs increasingly numerous and complicated, submitted a request to resign from his position as Bao head. The district office has preliminarily approved the appointment of the deputy Bao head, Gu Zunyi, as acting Bao head.

<h3>Questions and Answers Regarding Doubts About Household Registration Laws (Continued)</h3>
<p>(44) Question: Article 8 of the Household Registration Law stipulates that household registration shall be compiled with one family as one household. Although it is one family, those who live separately shall each be a separate household. However, Article 1122 of the Civil Law stipulates that cohabitation is the main condition for forming a family. If they do not live together, they are not one family. Then 1) how should the "family" in "although it is one family" be interpreted? 2) Does the so-called living separately include separation of property and residence? 3) If it refers specifically to residence, and the residences are far apart and privately owned by the residents, it seems that each can be compiled as a separate household. If the residences are also jointly owned and very close, such as living in two courtyards, should each also be compiled as a separate household?</p>
<p>Answer: Living separately as stated in Article 8 of the Household Registration Law should include separation of property or residence. Before the large family system is completely abolished, there are occasional cases where people live separately without dividing the property, and they are naturally each a separate household.</p>
<p>(45) Question: For the convenience of statistics during the first household registration, can a standard date be stipulated?</p>
<p>Answer: A standard date can be stipulated.</p>

<h3>Eliminating the Black Market for Cotton Yarn: Government and Businesses Work Together, Mills Allocate Yarn on Schedule for Joint Distribution, Ministry of Economic Affairs Discusses Organizing a Coordinating Agency</h3>
<p>(Special Telegram) Regarding the black market for yarn and cloth, it is heard that Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is determined to find ways to suppress it. Responsible persons from private yarn mills have expressed their willingness to assist government orders and stabilize prices. According to well-informed sources, the rise in black market prices in recent weeks has caused concern among private yarn mills. Whether their products should be subject to unified distribution by the Textile Construction (纺建) has been discussed by industry insiders for many days. After a meeting convened by the Textile Construction the day before yesterday, the atmosphere became more intense. Yesterday, because of this, meetings were held for a long time, and it was decided to allocate tens of thousands of pieces of yarn on schedule to be combined with the Textile Construction for flat-price, public distribution. A committee has been formed to discuss this. Once this measure is implemented, it will undoubtedly ease the atmosphere in the market. Because in the past, the Textile Construction repeatedly raised prices, always using the market as an excuse to raise prices. There is no obligation for state-run enterprises to allow private enterprises to obtain excessive profits. Cotton yarn and cotton cloth vendors are also reportedly planning to rigorously rectify member businesses to avoid disturbances in the black market. However, in general, the public associations cannot clearly understand the actual situation of the Textile Construction opening its goods, and control is difficult. In addition, some small factories and various itinerant traders must have licensed sales firms to provide intermediary assistance. If the Textile Construction does not open its goods universally and evenly, these small factories and itinerant traders will experience difficulties. According to sources in the cotton product replication industry, if the black market for cotton yarn is not eliminated, various factories will inevitably suspend production. It is also claimed that the recent rise in the black market for cotton yarn has made it impossible for legitimate businesses to obtain goods. In the yarn and cloth market, it is common to sell Textile Construction transaction orders at inflated prices. The person in charge of the industry is extremely worried about this. According to his statement, in the future, if the Textile Construction can invite the public association to the site to contribute opinions when opening goods, this matter can be greatly reduced. Observers with status say that in the future, the production and sales of yarn and cloth may increase the significance of control. The government will never let it go again, in order to destroy its foothold in stabilizing prices. It is also said that the Textile Construction is renting large buildings to expand its business organization.</p>
<p>(Report from our Nanjing office on the 26th) Pan Xulun, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs, returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 26th. According to his statement, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in order to make the market price of yarn and cloth tend to be reasonable, will strengthen the Cotton Textile Control Committee and plans to invite principals of private textile industries to participate. The unified distribution of yarn produced by state-owned and private yarn mills and the price will also be evaluated by the committee. As for the reason why the market price of cotton yarn in Shanghai differs significantly from the black market, it is caused by speculators in the yarn industry raising prices. The ministry is trying to find ways to stop it.</p>
<h3>Coal Allocation to Factories: Fuel Committee Does Not Raise Prices</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) Since the change in foreign exchange rates, imported goods such as diesel and gasoline have inevitably risen in price, but the coal market is still relatively stable, thanks to the Fuel Committee's maintenance of the allocated price. The committee has recently allocated a large amount of coal for factory use. Factories, due to the poor quality of the previous allocation, are mostly waiting and watching. However, according to the person in charge of the committee, improvements have been made in this regard. The allocated prices are listed below (unit: ton, delivered at Pudong Wharf): No. 2 Kaishan coal or Keelung coal: 140,000 yuan</p>
<p>No. 1 Kaishan coal: 150,000 yuan</p>
<p>Special Kaishan coal: 175,000 yuan</p>
<p>No. 2 block coal: 170,000 yuan</p>
<p>Train block coal: 180,000 yuan</p>
<p>No. 2 screened block coal: 190,000 yuan</p>
<p>Train screened block coal: 200,000 yuan</p>
<h3>Increasing Overseas Remittances: Progressing on All Fronts</h3>
<p>(Report from our Nanjing office on the 26th) One of the main purposes of this exchange rate adjustment is to induce overseas Chinese to remit money back to the country. The authorities concerned are now paying attention to this matter. For overseas Chinese remittances and goods from the Dutch East Indies, new measures will be adopted to benefit overseas Chinese. The restrictions on remittances from overseas Chinese in Malaya are also being planned for alternative methods to increase the amount of remittances.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Production Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Since the exchange rate adjustment, the prices of export native products have risen in response to the situation. The price of tung oil has been affected by the bidding in Shanghai, and the rise is unstoppable. Therefore, the export of tung oil will be difficult due to the daily rising prices in the production areas. Looking at the past week, the price of tung oil in Hankou has risen by 66.4 percent, Hangzhou has risen by 72.38 percent, and the Jin-Qu-Lan area has risen by 76.5 percent. In terms of market prices, there is a severe shortage of spot goods in Hangzhou, and the selling price is 95,000 to 100,000 yuan per shi dan. In the Jinhua, Qu County, and Lanxi areas, the on-site delivery price is 90,000 yuan per shi dan. There is a shortage of goods and chaotic prices, and normal transactions are not taking place.</p>
<h3>High Prices, Weak Substance</h3>
<p>Since the foreign exchange adjustment, the prices of all goods have risen. The import cost of wool fabric has indeed increased significantly. Therefore, the asking prices of various stores have risen accordingly. For example, American Melton cloth rose by another 3,000 yuan per yard the day before yesterday. However, looking at the substance, it has a strong exterior but a weak interior: (1) Even before the price increase, business was fundamentally slow. Now that prices have risen again, buyers want to buy but postpone the purchase. (2) More than half of the businesses in Qipan Street are burdened with high-interest loans. Now they are taking advantage of the opportunity to sell their goods and repay their debts. (3) The source of goods is constant, and most of the September and October drafts have already been purchased. People's hearts are still weak. Therefore, based on everyone's moonlight forecast, this price increase is like giving a strong stimulant to a seriously ill person.</p>
<h3>234 Securities Exchange Brokers Approved</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) According to reliable sources, the final number of brokers approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the first batch is 234. The Securities Exchange will arrange positions in the market based on this number. In addition, since the Securities Exchange Preparatory Committee held its 13th preparatory meeting a few days ago, various printed materials, venue equipment, office arrangements, and personnel reviews for internal use by the Securities Exchange have entered the final stages. It is decided that the opening will be on schedule on September 9. It is heard that the general manager of the Securities Exchange will be Wang Zhixin, and the assistant manager will be Guan Shanchang.</p>
<h3>US Loans at Low Prices: Not Necessarily Unfavorable to Us</h3>
<p>(Nanjing Telegram) After the price adjustment in the United States, the announcement to correct the pricing of US export goods aims to prevent the sale price of US goods in foreign markets from rising. The price of goods sold by the United States to foreign countries will be based on the domestic limited price, plus a reasonable profit, handling fee, and insurance cost. Business circles believe that this move will make US goods more popular in our country and affect the sales of domestic goods. A reporter visited important personnel of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to inquire about their thoughts on this matter. According to their statement, general consumer goods may become popular because of this, and our country will benefit from the necessary materials being transported. The price of automobiles in Shanghai is significantly higher than in the United States, and the reason is that the profits of importers are too high. The US government restricts the interests of merchants, so the price of cars can be reduced, which will help the development of our transportation. Other necessary materials are expected to be reduced accordingly.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Import Restrictions: Central Government Thoroughly Investigates the Source</h3>
<p>(Report from our Nanjing office on the 26th) It is rumored that our country will ban the import of foreign cotton yarn and hardware, and it is said that this news was issued by the China News Agency of the Central Propaganda Department. The reporter visited the director of the International Propaganda Office, Zeng Baibai, about this matter. According to his statement, Nanjing has not issued this news. In order to clarify the facts, he has telegraphed the New York office for inquiries. According to the United Press, the Customs Administration and the Director-General of Customs have denied this.</p>
<h3>France Plans to Order 20,000 Dan of Tea</h3>
<p>France recently plans to order 20,000 dan of tea from our country, and the relevant parties are discussing it. After the price agreement is reached, the transaction can be completed.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, Egypt is currently in need of a large amount of tea imports and is reportedly considering exempting import taxes.</p>
<h3>Anhui Tea Center Market</h3>
<p>China-US Agricultural Technology Cooperation Tea Group Goes to Su (Jiangsu) to Investigate the Tea Market</p>
<p>The China-US Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group regards Wuhu in Anhui as the distribution center for Anhui tea. It has sent three tea group technicians to inspect the tea market on-site. It is reported that the Anhui Provincial Government originally intended to promote Wuhu into a tea center market. Now that it has received attention from the China-US Agricultural Technology Cooperation, it is even more seeking its rapid completion, so Wuhu, in addition to being a rice and grain center market in the Yangtze River basin, is also the source for Anhui tea.</p>
<h3>Edible Oil Prices Rise Sharply: Social Affairs Bureau Discusses Countermeasures, Warehouse Receipts Limited to Five Days for Pickup, Otherwise Considered Hoarding, Manufacturers Request Adjustment of Allocation Prices to Avoid Bearing Losses Alone</h3>
<p>Edible oil prices have recently risen sharply, (26th) rising to 79,000 yuan, almost reaching the 80,000 yuan mark. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau is discussing effective countermeasures with relevant parties and oil manufacturers. Emergency measures have been taken to strictly prohibit the sale of edible oil warehouse receipts externally and limit the pickup of goods within five days. Otherwise, it will be considered hoarding, and in addition to invalidating the warehouse receipts, they will also be punished according to law. According to people in the industry, the reason for this price increase is that the price of rapeseed, the raw material for oil production, has risen due to the stimulation of foreign exchange adjustments. When raw materials rise, finished products also rise. Manufacturers ask the Social Affairs Bureau to consider the actual situation and adjust allocation prices to avoid manufacturers bearing losses alone and reduce unreasonable phenomena. The decision is that due to power relations, the current factories cannot produce as ideally. Shunyu, Dayouyu, Dachangxin, Changde, and Dadexin and other five factories, the daily output is less than 500 dan. China Vegetable Oil Factory is also unable to increase production due to power relations. Manufacturers are very hoping that the power problem can be properly resolved. However, the current edible oil reserves in the city are still very abundant. China Food Oil Company alone has more than 11,000 dan of goods in stock, so people in the industry hope that the company can release a large amount at this time.</p>
<h3>Foreign Loans Dominate: Domestic Clocks Cannot Compete, Clock Factories Request Government Assistance</h3>
<p>With the influx of foreign goods, all industries are affected. The Chinese clock manufacturing industry has recently issued an emergency appeal. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Overview of China's Clock Manufacturing Industry</p>
<p>Before the war, there were four clock manufacturing factories in our country, namely Deshunxing, Yongye, Yongkang, and Dean in Yantai, and four in Shanghai, namely Zhonghua, Changming, Zhonghua Electric Clock, and Shanghai. They could produce and sell more than 170,000 clocks annually. During the Anti-Japanese War, four more factories were established in Shanghai, namely China, Zhongming, Jinsheng, and Far East. They could also produce and sell more than 200,000 clocks annually. This is in terms of actual production and sales figures. If there were no imports, the production figures would be even higher. The market is not only for domestic sales but also for transportation to the South Pacific islands. After eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, transportation and sales stagnated, and the finished products have been piling up until now, with no sales market.</p>
<p>Turning Victory into Defeat: Extremely Dangerous</p>
<p>However, the current domestic clock factories are being defeated by foreign goods. The price of a medium-sized American clock is about US$1.50 to US$2.00. Calculated at an exchange rate of 3,350, it is equivalent to 5,020 to 6,700 yuan in national currency. Adding transportation costs and tariffs of 47.7%, it is still only between 7,400 and 9,800 yuan in national currency. However, for domestic manufacturers, the raw material cost alone is more than 15,000 yuan per clock, plus labor costs and factory expenses of more than 15,000 yuan, the total cost of a medium-sized clock is more than 30,000 yuan, which is more than three times the price of an American clock.</p>
<p>All Clock Factories Issue Appeals</p>
<p>All clock factories in this city have recently taken concerted action and requested the China National Industrial Association to immediately telegraph the Executive Yuan and relevant ministries and commissions to request: (1) Revise import tariffs, increase the tax on clocks, or include them in item A, paragraph 1, to restrict the quantity of imports. (2) Reduce or exempt tariffs on clock materials such as clockwork for wooden clocks, enameled wire for electric clocks, and new equipment to encourage imports. The above two points concern the survival of the industry and require the government to implement them immediately.</p>
<h3>"Timely" Clock Company Maintains Original Prices</h3>
<p>In order to support national policy, the "Timely" Clock Company announced that all its branches across the country will sell various clocks, watches and parts at the original prices before the 19th.</p>
<h3>Various Industries Declare Profits Tax: Undeclared Businesses Limited to Reporting by September 5, Overdue Businesses Will Have Taxes Assessed and Ordered to Pay Directly by the Bureau</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) The Direct Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance attaches great importance to the collection of profits tax in this city for the 34th year and has sent a special inspection director to Shanghai to supervise and urge. The tax and business committees of the city's chamber of commerce recently had detailed discussions on issues such as assessment, general investigation, and tax amount. According to the Direct Taxation Bureau, the collection of profits tax must not be delayed any longer, so it is hoped that the tax committee will expedite the sorting of the declared industries, speed up the compilation of statistics, and for those who have not declared, the Direct Taxation Bureau will send personnel to conduct on-site audits to estimate the tax amount and order them to report and pay. The tax amount reported by various industries should be thoroughly audited and accurately reported to meet expectations. The Tax Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that before August of the 34th year, the area was still under occupation. Industries such as food, cloth, and shipping were all subject to enemy and puppet control and could not operate. Business was suspended. After the victory, due to the conversion of puppet currency and the obstruction and lack of transportation and raw materials, various industries had little surplus. Post-disaster commerce is indeed unable to bear the burden, so it is feared that the tax amount will be difficult to reach the expected figures. As for the industries that have not declared, they will be urged to declare as soon as possible. As a result of the discussions between the two sides, the industries that have not declared their profits tax for the 34th year are limited to submitting them to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce before September 5. Those who fail to report within the time limit will have their taxes assessed and ordered to pay directly by the Direct Taxation Bureau in order to start the collection on schedule. The reporter learned that more than 120 units have already declared, and excerpts are listed below:</p>
<p>Sugar industry, sauce and wine industry, auto freight industry, auto parts industry, engraving industry, towel and blanket industry, leather goods industry, banking industry, material bottle industry</p>

<h3>Alas, the Hunan Disaster!</h3>
<p>Hunan Province, which suffered the most during the war, has once again suffered natural disasters in peacetime, and the disaster situation is the most tragic. In the counties near Hengyang, people who have starved to death and are awaiting assistance are everywhere. It is deeply hoped that compatriots in other provinces who have not suffered disasters, after seeing these photos, will shed tears of sympathy and do their best to rescue these Hunan compatriots who have contributed to the war of resistance and are now facing adversity.

<h3>On the Banks of the Huai</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Huainan by Our Correspondent Shao Shenzhi, dated the 23rd</p>
<p>"Between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, it is where five directions converge, where all goods gather. The advantages of fertile fields and the riches of mountains, rivers, and marshes are unmatched by those far and near." — Gu Zuyu, on the Huainan Road</p>
<p>From Bengbu to western Anhui, one can either travel upstream along the Huai River or take the Shuijiahu-Bengbu branch line of the Huainan Railway. Currently, the Huainan Railway is operating combined water-land transport from Bengbu to Zhengyangguan, making this route the only thoroughfare to the west.</p>
<p>The fertile alluvial plain of the Huai River, known for "nine out of ten years of famine," is unimaginable. However, the current vast expanse of water is a reality. Throughout history, the north and south have contended, turning the areas along the Huai River into a buffer zone, and frequently a battlefield, its survival impacting the gains and losses of the entire country. In an ununified China, this land has been tossed back and forth by warlords. The impression the people have of officials and bandits is indistinguishable. Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty rose from Jiangnan, Huan Wen used the armor of the Jianghuai region, balancing the Central Plains. Zhu Wen and Liu Futong rose up, their voices echoing along the Huai River. Historians use this to argue that the people of the Huai River region are tough and stubborn, but in reality, it is a manifestation of the people seeking a way out for themselves. History is by no means predestined. If China can achieve stability, the Huai River region is where first-rate politicians can display their talents.</p>
<p>Now, taking a train from Bengbu to Shuijiahu, one does not see a single even slightly well-organized village. The entire plain is filled with a complicated mix of crops, lacking the neat rice cultivation of the Taihu Lake region, thus highlighting the fragmentation of the land. Flax, rice, sorghum, millet, sesame, sweet potatoes, soybeans, tobacco, and hemp – these nine crops are commonly found on this land. It is difficult to discern which is the main crop. There is also a small amount of cotton and sunflowers. In reality, tobacco accounts for a large proportion, its green flourishing, and its reddish-white flowers blooming strongly in the autumn wind. Sorghum ears have already turned deep red, some having been harvested, leaving only the stalks, standing or fallen, awaiting dryness. The height of the various crops varies, the shades of green are uneven, and the sorghum is particularly sparse and thin, indicating that the fertilization and cultivation lack the necessary depth. The land is good land, but years of unregulated use have made the soil infertile. What does this tell us? The farmers invest nothing more than simple and weak labor into the land. Now, these uneven shades of green also indicate that these exhausted farmers are still clinging to this place. If they become overgrown with weeds, they will no longer be farmers.</p>
<p>They have always been subjected to man-made forces, and now it is clear that they are even less able to fight against man-made natural disasters. Arriving at Wudian station, the water that has overflowed from Huanggu began to reveal itself. At a bridge east of the station, the bridge pier has been loosened by the water. The train stopped, and a railway police officer came to each carriage to inform the passengers to disembark and walk, allowing the empty carriage to slowly enter Wudian station, then re-boarding the train to continue southwest. However, at Bridge No. 3, located at the 52-kilometer mark, one end of the bridge pier had completely collapsed. It is said that this is the third time, and it may not be repaired within ten days. The train can only connect transportation at both ends of the bridge, unloading passengers and goods, taking nearly two hours. This route originally had two passenger trains per day, but now it has been reduced to one, making the train particularly crowded. There are not enough passenger cars, so high-sided wagons are used instead. Passengers are baked in the hot sun all the way, and their suffering is imaginable. They also have to climb up and down to grab seats, sweating profusely. From Wudian all the way north to Shuijiahu, the land on both sides of the road is a vast expanse of water, leaving only a narrow roadbed. In many places, there is no soil beneath the end of the rail ties, and the water is still eroding below. The speed is only 15 kilometers to ensure safety. Sitting in the car and looking out, one suspects that one is sitting on a boat. Therefore, when the train stopped there for too long, everyone became annoyed, hungry, and thirsty. Almost every carriage was arguing, and the sounds of yelling and cursing were chaotic. The conductor was extremely busy, running back and forth, his brow furrowed. An old woman covered in patches hurried from three or four miles away, across the water, carrying a pot in her hand, explaining that it was cold water. "Look how clear it is!" It could be sold for ten or fifty yuan a bowl. She sold pot after pot, because this was not roadside mud.</p>
<p>After passing Beizha station in Shuijiahu, the speed increased. It takes eight or nine hours to travel more than 80 kilometers from Bengbu to Tianjiagang. The magnitude of the water has dealt a severe blow to this traffic line that has just been repaired.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Xu Qiming, Chief of Staff of the 8th Pacification Zone Command</p>
<p>Bunkers and Mines</p>
<p>A month ago, over two thousand men from Li Xiannian's army broke out of southern Henan, crossed the Huainan Railway between Luoji and Xiatang, and crossed the Jinpu Railway to northern Jiangsu. The situation in central Anhui became very tense. Now it is slightly more stable, but bunkers are everywhere, and the military atmosphere is very strong. From Tianjia'an to the Huainan Mine, within a short 10 kilometers, there are more than 100 concrete and steel-reinforced bunkers, equipped with lighting. Factories and mines are heavily guarded by electric fences, all left behind by the Japanese. The ten thousand employees of the Huainan Railway Bureau have a belief that this strengthens their safety.</p>
<p>Before the war, the Huainan Railway ran from Tianjia'an on the south bank of Huaiyuan to Yuxikou, a distance of 214 kilometers, and included a coal mine at the foot of Jiulonggang Shungeng Mountain. This private enterprise only officially operated for less than two years. It opened to traffic in January of the 25th year and was ordered to be destroyed in October of the 26th year. The entire line fell into enemy hands in June of the 27th year. The Huainan Mine produced more than 2,000 tons of coal per day. Another private enterprise, Datong Coal Mine, produced 2,000 tons per month, relying entirely on this line for transportation and export. By the time it was taken over last year, the railway and mine were in ruins. The 188-kilometer section from Shuijiahu to Yuxikou had been dismantled by the puppet Central China Railway Bureau in the 33rd year, and another Shuibeng branch line, which is now open to traffic, was built to connect Jinpu and transport coal by land.</p>
<p>From a commercial point of view, the Huainan Mine must seek its own export and develop new transportation and sales routes. Only by not relying on other transportation institutions can it be easier to operate. The Japanese believed that there was a shortage of transport ships and that they were easily bombed. Transport by river was no longer necessary, and the Jinpu line was forced to implement a segmented coal supply plan to meet military needs. It was an easy matter to build the short 61 kilometers from Shuijiahu. However, this line had no other use other than transporting coal. Moreover, the area was adjacent to our army's front line at Zhengyangguan, making it a military front. Therefore, the route was chosen hastily, and the construction was extremely crude. After the Japanese surrendered, the Communist army's destructive offensive did not let up. The Japanese military sent personnel to the Datong and Huainan mines to urge coal production. For several years, these two private enterprise units had been integrated. Now it is difficult to separate them. The Japanese military ordered how many tons to be produced, and they had to try their best to mine them. There was a shortage of equipment, especially wood, so mining was not done in the usual way, resulting in a mess. The places where mining was done were full of danger.</p>
<p>Director Wu Jingqing said: "We came to take over a chaotic pile. The Japanese technicians' performance here was a complete mess." There were also those few troops who wanted to find some jewels in the black coal. He told me that the only bathtub in the dormitory was still one that he had found in the field and carried back. "They moved it to feed the horses." Countless stories of lawlessness made one's hair stand on end and caused great astonishment.</p>
<p>On June 1st, the branch line was repaired and finally opened to traffic, transporting the coal out. After half a year of hard work since the takeover, everyone breathed a sigh of relief. But now that the road is broken, the coal can only be piled up. When it is finally transported, it will require an extra labor cost for loading, which will increase the cost considerably. The roadbed from Shuijiahu to Yuxikou still exists and is passable by automobiles. The Anhui Provincial Highway Bureau collects road maintenance fees here, but the name is misleading, as it is actually a kind of automobile traffic tax. The Railway Bureau is repairing bridges and roads, still hoping to restore the rails, but the material is a problem. The Canadian side has a strong interest in investing, but the mode of cooperation has not yet been decided. However, an enterprise surrounded by bunkers is a strong ironic commentary on China's construction.</p>

<p>A Close-Up View of Restoring Train Service</p>
<p>The prospect of the enterprise is entirely dependent on peace and stability.</p>
<p>Director Wu Jingqing studied mechanical engineering in the United States and electrical engineering in Germany. He returned to China with a Siemens engineering qualification and built the famous Qishuyan Power Plant. "Today, it seems like an insignificant power plant." During Minister Zeng Yangfu's time, he was the director of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau and the director of the Materials Department of the Ministry of Communications. Now, he has been hired by the Huainan Railway Company's board of directors to serve as the director of the bureau. He is one of the people in charge of the enterprise in this bunker formation. The official acceptance was completed on December 16th of last year. According to statistics, the total loss of the entire line was seven-eighths. They received three dilapidated stations, 30 miles of railway, more than 300 usable and unusable carriages, and 16 locomotives, only three of which could move. Before the war, there were 700 carriages and 56 locomotives. The Shuibeng branch line was built by the enemy and puppets. Although the materials were taken from Huainan, it belongs to the government. The Ministry of Communications said: "The bridge belongs to the bridge, the road belongs to the road. This is the enemy and puppet's property. As for the original Huainan losses, they will be compensated one day." Now the Shuibeng section is leased from the government, with a monthly rent of several million yuan, which is about one-sixth of the total passenger ticket revenue. Under this kind of property relationship, in normal circumstances, the strengthening of this branch line will inevitably be limited. It is good to have smooth traffic, and the lessee will definitely not electrify it on their own. Various objective conditions determine China's stagnation.</p>
<p>The near-term prospect of restoring train service to Tianyu exists, and several billion in capital has already been invested. The locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars that could be repaired have been repaired, and those that have been scrapped are also being repaired. I visited the Huainan Bureau's locomotive factory, which is converting iron gondolas into third-class carriages, adding springs, glass windows, and seats, ventilation, and heat protection. A new car can be produced, which is not easy. It is clear that they are working hard in simple equipment. Currently, the only first-class passenger car running on the road was just an empty shell when it was taken over. After three months of assembly, it was completely applied before the opening of traffic on June 1st. In addition, a 50-meter-long steel bridge beam was built, one of the major engineering projects in bridge and road repair, one of the bitter engineering projects. There are many young workers in this factory, aged fifteen or sixteen. The factory director, Liu Xinmin, is only in his thirties. They all believe that as long as there are track materials, train service can be restored in six months. But they can't afford to buy them, and they can't be allocated. The fate of the state-owned railway is still unknown.</p>
<p>The Railway and Mining Bureaus</p>
<p>This Railway Bureau includes the Railway and Mining Bureaus, which are respectively managed by Deputy Directors Hu Weizhong and Ning Shufan. Datong Mine has been merged into the Huainan Bureau because the Japanese had already connected them. If they didn't merge, they would have had to merge anyway. The Datong and Huainan mines currently produce 1,500 tons of coal per day, supplying 9,000 tons to the Jinpu Railway at 35,000 yuan per ton and 30,000 tons to the Coal and Coke Management Office at 60,000 yuan per ton. This Management Office is like a national trading company, earning a profit when distributing it. Coal for industrial use can be sold for 120,000 yuan, and other allocated coal is even more expensive. "They earned several billion yuan. If this money was in our hands, we could buy goods from abroad with cash and restore train service immediately," Wu Jingqing said with emotion.</p>
<p>The two mines operate in shifts day and night. The winding machine turns non-stop for 24 hours a day, one after another, hoisting coal from the well. The coal seam is inclined at 70 degrees, making mining very labor-intensive. Originally, it was 100 meters deep, but it has been mined so dangerously over the years that it is no longer possible to enter. We had no choice but to dig deeper downwards and mine according to the normal method. One well needs to be dug as deep as 350 meters, and it takes two minutes for the coal car to be hoisted to the bottom. This will take ten months to complete. Datong Mine has better equipment, and its output can reach half of its pre-war output, but by this time next year, it will probably exceed its pre-war output. Both mines are appraising new wells, and it is estimated that they will be able to produce coal in two or three years. At that time, it will gradually reach 5,000 tons.</p>
<p>The bureau has more than 10,000 employees, each receiving three and a half catties of white flour per day. Wages are graded, ranging from 230,000 to 100,000 yuan or so. The bureau said that it cannot make ends meet and loses money every month.</p>
<p>The Japanese built a power plant in Tianjia'an, but unfortunately, it is just an empty house. A 30,000-kilowatt machine had just been shipped to Datong when the Japanese surrendered. It can be seen that the Japanese still wanted to mine more coal here. If all the current generators are turned on, they can produce more than 5,000 kilowatts, but not that much is needed yet.</p>
<p>Restoring train service to Tianyu is a near-term prospect, increasing mine production is a near-term prospect, and there is also power equipment. As long as the machines are installed, some electricity can be used for agricultural reclamation. Although they are all in sight, the development of the enterprise still requires political rationalization, peace and stability, and liberation from the bunkers!</p>

<p>The Flood at Shungeng</p>
<p>Walking two or three kilometers west from Jiulonggang, where the Huainan Railway Bureau is located, you reach Shungeng Mountain.</p>
<p>Historical legend says that Shun once farmed here. Shun is just a figure from the era of historical legends, but this may prove that before the Zhou Dynasty, the Central Plains people had already moved east along the river and developed agriculture in this area, reaching its peak in the Qin and Han dynasties. "Shun" became a general term for this nation and era. Before "Shun," wasn't there the legend of "Yu the Great" controlling the floods? Yu traveled the Nine Provinces (also according to legend), water conservancy flourished, and agriculture followed. This is all explainable. In any case, it is undeniable that this period of history existed. Now, Shungeng Mountain rises up in the middle of a marsh, truly a misfortune of history!</p>
<p>I traveled along the banks of the Huai River and saw the floods causing disasters, with the common people hiding in the trees. At this time, I ran to the foot of Shungeng Mountain, a place named by the Chinese to commemorate historical achievements, and saw many farmers cultivating the fields in the setting sun, rising and falling among the tobacco bushes. Shungeng Mountain meanders east and west, but it is actually just a strip of earth. They seem to have forgotten the glorious ancient times and resigned themselves to a painful fate. They certainly do not have this kind of historical knowledge, as Bacon said, because without knowledge, one loses rights. However, although they do not sigh and commemorate the rule of the Three Dynasties, they draw the most practical knowledge from their real lives. Bacon's theory of knowledge is just utilitarianism.</p>
<p>My conversation with a group of farmers led to a very surprising conclusion. They rely entirely on their hands, without using any tools, and are picking off the flower spikes of the tobacco plants, as well as the small leaves next to the stalks, getting their hands covered in mucus.</p>
<p>"Sir," a middle-aged farmer said to me, "these flowers are useless. Picking them off allows the tobacco oil to go into the leaves, making the leaves thicker and able to bear a share of the harvest. This year's harvest is not good. Look, half of that land has been ruined by the water. Leaves that small are unusable." He used his palm to support a heavy, dark eight-inch-wide leaf, and continued, "It has to be this big to be able to sell for money."</p>
<p>I asked them how many leaves they could harvest per acre and how much money they could sell them for. They said that this year, this field can only yield a little over two loads. In previous years, it would always be a little over three loads. As for how much money they can sell it for, it's hard to say. It has been sold for more than 100,000, but as soon as the new leaves come out, the price has already fallen to 60,000 or so. This year, charcoal is also expensive, and it also takes labor to bake the leaves. It's hard to calculate.</p>
<p>"Sir, you know, now that foreign cigarettes are coming, it's hard for our tobacco leaves to get a good price." Another farmer came out of the leaves, picked up a piece of dry, loose mud from the field, and rubbed it in his palm, because his hands were already covered in mucus from the tobacco. I was stunned to hear him say this in a remote rural area. He was in his late fifties, with a wrinkled face, reddish-black skin, a healthy and strong body, wearing a wide-brimmed straw hat, and a pipe in his mouth, revealing a set of even yellow teeth, making me think of a Californian American. I thought he must be the boss. But he said:</p>
<p>"No, the boss is at home. We're all working for someone else."</p>
<p>There were five of them in total, belonging to two different bosses. Two were locals, and three were from Taixian and Yingshang. The way they said it clearly indicated that they were all hired laborers. One boss cultivated ten acres of land, and the other cultivated only five acres. Even such small landlords have hired laborers. Each of them manages about three acres. They don't all grow tobacco; they also grow a little sorghum and rice. One acre of sorghum yields four loads, and the current market price is 2,500 yuan per dou. They only grow some of it to eat themselves; it is the tobacco that is sold for money.</p>
<p>The boss provides them with food and pays them more than 100,000 yuan a year. This is their entire compensation.</p>
<p>"Is that enough? We're considered to be doing well. Other families only pay 80,000 yuan a year," said the one wearing the wide-brimmed straw hat.</p>
<p>Their one-year employment contract runs from the tenth month of the lunar calendar last year to the tenth month of this year. Last October, they agreed on only 40,000 yuan, but prices soared tenfold in one spring. In the sixth month of the lunar calendar, they told the boss that the money was not enough to use and that they had to increase it. This was increased to more than 100,000, but there was no definite figure. They will not be able to receive the full amount until October. It's not easy being a boss either.</p>
<p>"Want to try our tobacco? It just doesn't have any flavoring, so you might not be used to smoking it," said the middle-aged man.</p>
<p>Naturally, I was very happy to. We all sat down on the edge of the field. He tore off a fresh yellow leaf from the tobacco stalk, rolled the smoked dark ochre-colored tobacco crumbs inside, like a cigar, and put it in my pipe. At first, it felt very mellow, but then it became spicier and spicier, and finally, I couldn't smoke it anymore.</p>
<p>The setting sun sank behind Shungeng Mountain, and it was time to rest. The middle-aged man asked me: "Sir, are you here to buy leaves? Come sit at our boss's place."</p>
<p>I said, "No."</p>
<p>"Then are you from the mine over there? The hardest thing is farming. Being a laborer at your place would be great!"</p>
<p>The Railway Bureau's farmland is really like a plantation, with many hired workers from all over growing crops. They have three and a half catties of flour per day, and their wages are 20,000 yuan per month.</p>
<p>These hired laborers have no land and live by selling their labor. They worry about what will happen when they get old and envy the treatment of the laborers at the Railway Bureau. Our conversation forgot about the setting sun that had already sunk in the west. (Sent from Jiulonggang)</p>
<h3>Manila: City of Jeeps</h3>
<p>—航訊 July 26th Air Mail — Central News Agency Reporter Xing Guangzu</p>
<p>The entire city of Manila is like a city of Jeeps. The sheer number of Jeeps is rarely seen in any other city. These brown, motorized reptiles are constantly moving, leaving no second of idleness on the streets of Manila. Many of these Jeeps are still military-grade, while some have been converted for civilian use. The majority are modified into buses, soliciting passengers in all areas. And these "buses" are painted in various bizarre colors and plastered with eye-catching advertisements.</p>
<p>Daily Thefts Number Several Cases</p>
<p>As you stroll or stand on any street, you can hear these profit-seeking motorized reptiles honking their horns, calling out, "Quiapo go, or not?" "Pasay go, or not?" "San Juan go, or not?" If you climb into its shell, you'll see the swarthy, tousle-haired drivers fiddling with the controls. They constantly whistle or hum folk songs, in rhythm with the jolting of the vehicle. Sometimes, with curious glances, they ask in Spanish-accented English: "You Chinese?" "Where you from, Shanghai?" "You come to do business?"</p>
<p>As the car passes a row of shops owned by overseas Chinese, they will tell you: "These are all Chinese stores, they are all very rich!"</p>
<p>Every morning at eight o'clock and afternoon at two o'clock are the busiest and most crowded times in Manila. Six or seven rows of vehicles line up at the crossroads, sometimes unable to move for thirty minutes. When the traffic police issue a whistle, the many motorized bugs waiting for the final sprint rush off with a collective roar, like a group of crazy prisoners released from prison, running straight in one direction. However, at many smaller intersections where there are no police to maintain order, the situation is different. Most of the vehicles squeeze together, trying to find an opportunity to move east, all like unbridled wild horses, entrusting the lives of the entire car to the driver's reason and alertness. Sometimes, when driving to the center and encountering a vehicle coming from the side, they have to brake hard, with a "wa" sound, like an animal shrieking when its tail is burned.</p>
<p>The traffic here often gives people a sense of chaos. There are so many vehicles, but there are very few police officers maintaining traffic at each intersection. Cars compete for space, unable to be controlled, which only causes traffic jams and delays. In addition, the Jeeps converted into small buses do not have fixed stations, and the starting and ending points are uncertain. In particular, they can solicit passengers at any location, sometimes squeezing from dense rows of vehicles to the roadside, leaving the cars behind them at a loss.</p>
<p>Because there are many vehicles, car theft is rampant. Almost every day, several car theft cases occur, but very few are solved. It is said that most of the stolen vehicles are driven to more distant cities to be sold (vehicle licenses are not limited to regions), so it is impossible to investigate. Many car owners, even if they can drive themselves, often hire drivers because someone must be able to guard the vehicle when they are in the office or handling affairs. Otherwise, there is a possibility of theft at any time. At the same time, the construction of car garages is much stronger than that of residences. Even if the car doors and car itself are locked, one must still be careful to be on guard at night. Recently, a ridiculous car theft incident occurred in the city center. A car parked on the side of the road and guarded by a driver was suddenly jumped into by several robbers, who took out guns and forced the driver to drive to the suburbs. When they reached a deserted place, they ordered the driver to get out of the car, then drove away, leaving the driver watching the dust fly, unable to do anything.</p>
<p>Currently, the most thorny problem for this young island nation is how to establish an independent economy, because financial support is thin and the economy is broken, causing many social unrests. The most obvious is theft. Opening the newspaper every day, there is hardly a day without theft. According to police reports: there are an average of thirty cases per day. We know that the most basic task of a government is to maintain social order so that people can live and work in peace. However, Manila, the capital of the Republic of the Philippines, is rampant with thieves.</p>
<p>Kidnappings and Missing Girls</p>
<p>These are daily occurrences, and kidnapping and missing girls are comparable in number to these theft cases. According to a report released by Manila's Juvenile Delinquent Investigation Bureau (Tuvemile Bureau), since January of this year, the bureau has handled over three thousand cases. There were 744 cases in January, 683 cases in February, 784 cases in March, and 649 cases in April. These are the figures submitted to the prosecutor's office for handling; the rest, which were not accepted due to insufficient evidence, are not included. At the same time, flipping through the classified advertisement columns of the daily newspapers, one can always see bizarre advertisements such as "missing," "searching," and "saving for later." The police station receives an average of thirty such missing person cases per week, and most of the missing persons are young girls.</p>
<p>According to police statistics, missing girls account for 80% of the total number of missing person cases, aged between fifteen and twenty, and the time of disappearance is from 8:00 AM to noon, almost several cases every day. In the police station, there are always elderly parents reporting their daughter's disappearance with tears in their eyes: "She is eighteen years old, has a black mole on her upper lip, she was wearing a pink shirt and skirt that day, her hair is not long, but curly and parted on both sides." The police sometimes dismiss it because most of these cases are related to elopement. Many young girls who are just beginning to experience love may be attracted to an American soldier or a classmate, but their families are very stubborn, which can easily lead to elopement. Recently, a university beauty refused a male classmate's love proposal. One day, the classmate took her in a car to the deserted suburbs, claiming that he ran out of gasoline, and had to stay outside all night, finally getting his wish. So, police officers often say to the reporting parents: "Let this little girl stay outside for a few days, and when she comes back, there may be good news!" So, another moving photo of a young woman is added to the search list.</p>
<p>Poverty is the main cause of social unrest, and greed is the cause of the demise of national morality. What is currently pervading the Philippine Islands is this terrible phenomenon of poverty and greed. Therefore, those collaborators who help the wicked, those murderers and robbers, and even gangster bandits, can have the meaning of a legal vocabulary slightly distorted, or even without explanation, and can be released on bail. Such as the postponement of the trial of Laurel, the president of the puppet government, the release of Osias, the pseudo-Minister of Education, with a fine of 50,000 yuan, and many cases that are resolved without announcement, make people suspect the mischief of money. In addition, extortion at checkpoints, the processing of immigration certificates, and the installation of telephones require tips, and opening a restaurant requires bribing bureau officials, which can show all kinds of shortcomings in Philippine civil administration.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Manila City</p>
<p>The total number of overseas Chinese in the Philippines is estimated to be about 130,000 people. In Manila city alone, the number is over 70,000. Overseas Chinese came to the Philippines as early as 539 years before Magellan discovered the Philippines. At that time, China and the Philippines had already established trade relations. Since the Song and Yuan dynasties, up to the Republic of China, countless Chinese people admired the scenery of the Philippine Islands and crossed the sea to come here. For more than a thousand years, the Philippine Islands have been deeply influenced by our culture. Because of the hard work of our overseas Chinese, the Philippines has become a prosperous region in the Pacific. Since 992 BC, China and the Philippines have been intermarrying and have blood relations. Geographically, Manila is 631 nautical miles from Hong Kong, 675 nautical miles from Xiamen, and only 1,163 nautical miles from Shanghai, which is closer than any other major commercial port in the world. China and the Philippines have a long history of relationship, close cultural and blood exchanges, and interconnected geographical borders. It is no wonder that overseas Chinese generally regard the Philippine Islands as their second hometown and call China and the Philippines brothers.</p>
<p>Because of their objective position and their own characteristics, overseas Chinese in the Philippines cannot reform society, nor can they develop industry, so doing business has become an essential element of the lives of overseas Chinese. Although they did not receive legal protection due to the turbulent political situation before the war, overseas Chinese still held the lead in the Philippine business community due to the long history of trade between China and the Philippines. Before the war, the total investment of overseas Chinese in the Philippines accounted for about 80% of the total in the Philippines before 1941. By the time the Pacific War broke out and the Japanese invaders entered the Philippine Islands, due to the impact of the war, the sharp decline in import trade, and the competition from local Filipino merchants, it had fallen to 60%, but it was still able to influence the Philippine economy. Overseas Chinese are mainly engaged in import and export merchants and retailers.</p>
<p>Before the war, the main investments of import and export merchants among overseas Chinese were the trade of tobacco, rice, hemp, copra, timber, and various local products. However, after this war, the local products of the Philippine Islands have all gone bankrupt. During the Japanese occupation, most of the materials were plundered and destroyed. Currently, the Philippine Islands are in extreme panic of materials, and people's lives depend on import trade. Therefore, imported goods are still in short supply. The total investment of large and medium-sized merchants among overseas Chinese in import trade is more than 200 million yuan, which is more than double that before the war in terms of currency. Therefore, we can say that import trade has become the central hub of the business of overseas Chinese after the restoration. The second is retailers, because they require less capital and are easier to operate. A large number of overseas Chinese are engaged in retail, which has become the main component of the commercial society of overseas Chinese. However, because of the excessive number of people, they are often directly oppressed by the Philippines. For example, the retail Filipinization and vegetable market Filipinization bills proposed in the Philippine Congress will have a great impact on the livelihoods of overseas Chinese and have already created an inevitable crisis. It is hoped that our government authorities can work hard to promote Sino-Philippine relations, conclude commercial treaties, and give legal and proper protection to the general overseas Chinese merchants.</p>
<p>At present, there are about twenty schools established by overseas Chinese in Manila city. Among them, there are three secondary schools, with Philippine and Chiang Kai Shek College (Principal is Mr. Bao Shitian) being the most large-scale. Overseas Chinese education is currently encountering many difficulties. Although the Japanese invaders ruled the Philippine Islands for three years, the damage they caused to culture and education was very serious. Most of the original primary and secondary school buildings were burned down, and school equipment, books, instruments, and desks were completely lost. To rebuild, there is no funding. In addition, there are also problems such as a shortage of teachers and excessively low salaries for primary school teachers, which also need to be resolved and improved.</p>

<h3>Answering Readers Medical and Health</h3>
<p>(1) Eye Twitching and Headache</p>
<p>Zhang Qingquan asks: My daughter is twenty-five years old and healthy. Four years ago, the upper corner of her right eye suddenly started twitching, but the number of times per day was still small, and the twitching time was also short, but it has not healed for a long time, and the degree of twitching has increased day by day. After an examination by a doctor, it was said that it was caused by the seventh nerve, and two decayed molars had to be extracted. An X-ray examination was performed beforehand, but the result was not effective. Later, injections of Aitamine B1 and oral potassium iodide liquid were also ineffective. Finally, a doctor of internal medicine at the Red Cross Hospital introduced her to the Shanghai Electrotherapy Institute for electrotherapy. After a long time, it seemed to be slightly better at first, but the result was still aggravated, and the duration sometimes continued to twitch for more than half an hour, and she felt very uncomfortable with a headache and small eyes. Please indicate the treatment method.</p>
<p>[Medical Doctor Tang Renjin answers] It is a neurological orbicularis oculi muscle spasm. Treatment methods: It is advisable to take Belladonna preparations and Valerian tincture, etc. It is also necessary to divert her attention. There is probably no hope of a complete recovery, but there is no risk of blindness for her eyesight.</p>
<p>(2) Soft Bones and Weakness</p>
<p>Lu asks: I have several medical questions, please answer: (1) I am seventeen years old this year. I suffered from typhoid fever last autumn and was bedridden for two months. When the illness was about to heal, I felt that the outer side of my right thigh was numb, different from my left thigh. It has been half a year now, and it is still like this. I don't know why? (2) There is phlegm in my throat in the morning, and I can't cough it out. Even if I cough it out, it is only a small piece. Is it related to the lungs, and how to treat it? (3) My younger sister is six years old this year. She suffered from "sores and boils" on her feet for a long time when she was three years old. I asked a Chinese medicine doctor for treatment, applying medicine and taking medicine, but it was not effective. I then asked a Western doctor for diagnosis and treatment, who said that the medicine applied by the Chinese medicine doctor contained mercury, and now the mercury has entered the kidneys, so it has become kidney disease. Eating lightly for several months, I saw improvement. Still unable to walk, can only say simple words, but understands everything she hears. It is also said that it was caused by carelessness during childbirth, and water dripped into the brain, and surgery is required to cure it. May I ask: (A) Is not being able to walk since birth, and not being able to walk until now; is it related to kidney disease? Or is it related to carelessness during childbirth? (B) Is this type of disease rickets? Are there any treatments? (C) In addition to surgery, are there any other treatments? (D) Can you recommend a specialist doctor? (E) If I don't see a doctor, will it heal on its own? Is there a direct relationship between being weak, timid, and not being good at speaking? If she can walk later, will this condition disappear? (4) Some people say that tea leaves contain tannic acid, and drinking too much is harmful, while others say that it is beneficial and harmless. Which is right and which is wrong?</p>
<p>[Medical Doctor Tang Renjin answers] (1) It may be caused by nerve paralysis. You can try using diathermy and vitamin B injections. (2) It is feared to be pharyngitis. You can ask an ENT doctor for treatment. It has nothing to do with the lungs. (3) According to the letter, it is feared to be rickets. You can ask a pediatrician for diagnosis and treatment. (A) It is unrelated. (B) If it is rickets, you can use vitamin D calcium agents and sun lamp irradiation; (C) No surgery is required, the treatment is as above; (D) You can consult a pediatric specialist doctor, (E) It is feared to be difficult. (F) There is a related relationship, (4) In addition to tannic acid, tea leaves also contain vitamin C, and frequent drinking is beneficial.</p>
<p>(3) Rhinitis and Dizziness</p>
<p>Gao Jie asks: I have rhinitis, and turbid nasal discharge flows out from time to time. At first, I didn't think it was strange, but now it has suddenly turned severe. I often feel a fishy smell overflowing, and my head is dizzy and swollen. Chinese medicine doctors say it is pneumococcal sinusitis, and Western medicine doctors say it is rhinitis or Nasal Catarrh. The names are different, and it is difficult to determine. Please indicate the treatment method.</p>
<p>[Medical Doctor Tang Renjin answers] It is feared to be maxillary sinusitis, which requires surgical treatment by a nasal specialist.</p>
<h3>Eliminating Latent Tuberculosis and Popularizing Examinations</h3>
<p>— 本報 readers can get preferential opportunities See today's advertisement for details</p>
<p>According to a survey conducted by British Father Allen on July 18th, the incidence of tuberculosis among students in China has increased sharply to 15% after the war. Recently, the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts held an examination for new students and found that two out of 62 people were ill. At the Hudong Labor Hospital, one in every 20 workers was found to be ill, and most of the patients were young people around the age of 24. Therefore, most of the victims of tuberculosis belong to the most useful people in society. Now the cost of living is rising, day by day, which can be called a serious problem. The symptoms of tuberculosis are initially weight loss, fever, cough, insomnia, night sweats, and sometimes fatigue. At the beginning, it may be hidden or obvious, occurring and healing from time to time, making it unpredictable and most difficult to diagnose. Modern medicine uses X-ray examination, which is the easiest and most accurate. If we want to cope with the environment and solve everything, we must first maintain our health, and X-rays are the most impartial judge of lung health.</p>
<p>In big cities, tuberculosis transmission is the most widespread, affecting the public deeply and greatly. The Hongqiao Sanatorium in this city has always spared no effort in promoting anti-tuberculosis work. Now, in order to popularize prevention, this newspaper today publishes discount coupons for readers to undergo examination, in order to eliminate latent tuberculosis, achieve early treatment, save medicine, and stabilize society. Tuberculosis is the most widespread infectious disease, causing all kinds of poverty and miserable results, countless. I hope that all sectors will promote and implement examinations as much as possible. The more universal the examination, the safer the society will be.</p>

<p>Tianjin is the largest commercial port in North China, with seventy-two gullies converging into five major rivers to enter the Bohai Sea, reaching Liaoshen in the east and the old capital in the west, serving as the throat for the northern provinces to enter the sea, and standing as an important town. Since the July 7th Incident, Tianjin was the first to be occupied, and the Japanese invaders used this place as a base for military stations in North China, with warehouses standing and factories scattered. In addition, they built a new port in Tanggu, with a huge project that took three years to complete, which shows the depth of the Japanese invaders' intentions. The various military defense buildings inside and outside the city are also more numerous than in other places. Therefore, before the Japanese surrendered last year, the general residents here thought that if the US military landed in Qinhuangdao or Dagu Port in North China, the Japanese invaders would definitely defend Tianjin to the death, and the place would be devastated, which was unimaginable, so everyone was in danger.</p>
<p>Tianjin's Suburban Security is Becoming Increasingly Serious</p>
<p>Last year on August 15th, the Japanese invaders surrendered, and the Allied and National Armies successively stationed in the city. The prosperity of the city suddenly returned to its former appearance before the incident, and all military defense buildings were gradually dismantled. Since the government opened up foreign exchange, the market has become more prosperous. The general public thought that they could live and work in peace from now on, and the people from all over the country who were traveling in Tianjin could return to their hometowns one after another. Unexpectedly, the Communist Party launched a destructive strategy in various parts of North China this spring. At first, they demolished railways and bombed bridges, and then they attacked cities and seized land, burning, killing, and plundering. In a few months, the flames of war spread everywhere and spread to Central China. After the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, from Shandong Dezhou, fell, the Communist army actively advanced north, and Cangxian, Qingxian, and Machang were besieged several times, but were repelled. There are even more Communist troops lurking on both sides of the section of the Beining Railway between Beiping and Tangshan. Communist troops also appear in various parts of Tianjin's suburbs from time to time, so Tianjin's security is becoming increasingly serious. The recent situation in various aspects is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>The 94th Army is Concentrated and Stationed</p>
<p>Since peace, the local security of Tianjin has been the responsibility of the 94th Army of the National Army. Recently, due to the tight local defense, the 94th Army has sent workers to build ambush pillboxes and pillboxes at various important intersections and bridges in the city, especially the ambush pillboxes at the old concession intersections. The pillboxes are two or three stories high, forming a battlefield. The general public cannot help but be alarmed, and prices are also fluctuating and rising as a result.</p>
<p>The Blockade of Tianjin Causes Suffering for Peddlers</p>
<p>According to general peddlers who enter the city from the surrounding villages, the Communist army has adopted its consistent economic blockade policy against Tianjin. Various peddlers, if they are unfortunate enough to meet them, will have their goods and legal currency confiscated. If they argue, some are even stabbed to death on the spot, so currently, vegetables and fruits are feeling a shortage of sources, and prices are rising as a result.</p>
<p>The People's Self-Defense Force is Strengthening</p>
<p>Due to the situation, the local authorities here have begun citizen training in all ten districts of the city in order to strengthen the people's self-defense force. The organization adopts a one-three system, that is, one brigade is divided into three companies, each company is divided into three platoons, and each platoon is divided into three squads, with fifteen people in each squad. The brigade commander is the head of each police branch, and the company commander is the head of each police station or the group leader of the branch. Since it started last month, the results have been good.</p>
<p>Merchants and People Raise Funds to Comfort the National Army</p>
<p>Because the 94th Army has been stationed here to maintain the local area and rely on it for peace, and now when the defense is tight, and it is also during the summer holidays, the garrison is very hard, the various circles here have initiated a joint federation of various industries and local groups in various districts to raise 30 million yuan in donations and send them to the headquarters of the 94th Army to show their condolences.</p>
<p>US Troops Jointly Deploy at Night</p>
<p>In addition to the 94th Army being responsible for maintaining the security of Tianjin, the US troops stationed in Tianjin have repeatedly been infringed upon by the Communist army in various places recently. Therefore, after 10:00 pm every night, the US military headquarters sends armed soldiers to set up sentry posts at various important intersections in the suburbs of Tianjin, and adds tanks to defend important areas. They only withdraw after 5:00 am every morning. Pedestrians are prohibited from traveling after 12:00 every night, and the garrison area in Hebei is prohibited from traffic after 10:00 pm and will be lifted at 5:00 am the next morning.</p>

<h3>A Literary Giant: H.G. Wells, A Most Inspiring Figure</h3>
<p>— Mo Qu</p>
<p>H.G. Wells, the renowned British writer of science, politics, history, novels, and other works, has produced an immense body of work, including over twenty novels, nineteen works of fantasy, four massive collections of short stories, twelve books of essays on social, religious, and political issues, and numerous smaller pamphlets. His works are popular worldwide (with several translations in China as well) and have had a significant impact on intellectual circles. A great many men and women in Europe, America, and beyond have increased their knowledge through reading his works, and even social customs have changed to some extent due to his ideals. In British literature, he is comparable to Kipling and Bernard Shaw. He passed away on the 13th of this month at his home in London, at the age of seventy-nine. This is a loss for the world, especially the British literary world, which has lost one of its most attention-grabbing and inspiring figures. "The World's Great Men" edited by the British Hamerton contains a brief biography of him, and this biography is based on its key points, supplemented by recent newspaper reports about Wells.</p>
<p>Humble Origins</p>
<p>Herbert George Wells was born on September 21, 1866, in Bromley, Kent, of humble origins. His father was a professional cricketer who ran a grocery store in the town, and his mother was the daughter of an innkeeper. The couple never experienced joyful enjoyment during their lives. After the grocery store failed and closed, his mother was forced to work as a servant in a wealthy household. Due to the family's poverty, Wells left school at the age of thirteen and became an assistant to a chemist. Soon after, he switched to working in a clothing store. This was entirely against his will, so he studied hard in his spare time. As a result, in 1882, he obtained a position as an assistant teacher at Midhurst Grammar School. Later, through hard work, he obtained a scholarship and entered the University of London. In 1884, he graduated with honors from the Department of Zoology.</p>
<p>For the next few years, he worked as a teaching assistant and lecturer in biology at the university, but his interest in writing grew stronger. In 1893, encouraged by Henley [British writer], he resolutely entered the newspaper industry and began his writing career. Two years later, his first book, "Select Conversations with an Uncle," was published.</p>
<p>From that time on, Wells's life can be described as a full and rich development of his intellectual powers, which were revealed in his publications. The famous French writer Anatole France admired him greatly, calling him "the greatest intellectual force in the English-speaking world." His first successful novel, "The Time Machine" (published in 1895), showed him to be a man with scientific ideas and keen imagination. However, as an enthusiastic young socialist, he felt a sense of disgust for the world at that time, which can be clearly seen in his depiction of the bleak situation of the Morlocks and Eloi in the distant future.</p>
<p>Astonishment of Friends and Foes</p>
<p>Wells tells us in his autobiography that he was drawn to socialism by Plato and Henry George [American economist]. When he was studying in South Kensington, he paid close attention to the activities of the Fabian Society, but his impatience grew. Therefore, in a short period of time, he disagreed with the orthodox revolutionary doctrines, feeling that Marx was like a nightmare in the world of socialism because he denied the adaptability of intelligence in a didactic tone, which Wells regarded as his most precious treasure. Therefore, in the early stages of his career, he decided to take an independent revolutionary approach, an independence he maintained into old age. His intellectual vitality drove him to repeatedly improve his position. Like a kaleidoscope, he often changed his opinions.</p>
<p>Wells's changeable nature astonished both friends and foes, but behind this nature lay a vast, unchanging philosophy. Wells was a man with a clear mission and inspiration. He pursued the former with the force and fervor of a Crusader and propagated the latter. He did not rely on momentary emotional impulses but sincerely believed in the ultimate rationality of mankind, so he himself often respected reason. He expressed his hatred and love with ardent enthusiasm, but everything ultimately led to reason. This attitude may have been the greatest mistake of his life. He could not tolerate the stupidity that was particularly evident in the daily lives of human beings, and he despised it, which made him greatly ignorant of the naive reality of mankind.</p>
<p>Literary Concept</p>
<p>Therefore, Wells's literary career began with a focus on propaganda and continued without end. If he had wanted to, he could have become the most illustrious and greatest novelist of his time, but the theory of "art for art's sake" was a curse in his mind. He once replied to Henry James (British-American novelist) with a surprising protest: "Literature is an end in itself for you, like painting; for me, literature is a means, like architecture, and it is useful."</p>
<p>From this literary concept came several novels that are among the most outstanding achievements of modern literature. Following "The Time Machine," he wrote several works of fantasy and science fiction, such as "The Invisible Man" (published in 1897, adapted into a popular film in 1934). "The War of the Worlds," "The First Men in the Moon" (published in 1901), "The Food of the Gods" (published in 1904), "The War in the Air" (published in 1908, predicting the situation of the Great War), and "The World Set Free" (published in 1914). Each of these is characterized by speculating on the possibilities of scientific development, narrated in a vivid style, and full of pungent satire. His massive works "The Stolen Bacillus" (published in 1895) and "The Plattner Story" (published in 1897) reveal him to be a writer with a humorous genius and skilled in short stories. His "Love and Mr. Lewisham" (published in 1900) and "Kipps" (published in 1905) are considered by many to be literary masterpieces. After the publication of "Ann Veronica" (1909) and "The History of Mr. Polly" (1910), his reputation was consolidated, and he became a great novelist and a profound critic of contemporary social life. He also revealed his thoughts in the two books "Anticipations" (1901) and "First and Last Things" (1908). (According to recent newspaper reports, he also has three books: "Tono-Bungay," "The Country of the Blind," and "The Man Who Could Work Miracles," all of which are carefully crafted and belong to the category of novels.)</p>
<p>War Writings</p>
<p>Wells's writings on war include "The War That Will End War" (1914), "The Peace of the World," "Bealby" (a wonderful fantasy), "The Research Magnificent" (all three published in 1915), "Mr. Britling Sees It Through" (published in 1916, a moving account of the spirit of a country during wartime), "The Soul of a Bishop" (1917), "In the Fourth Year" (published in 1918, a critique of the League of Nations), and "Joan and Peter" (1918). The conclusions he made and what he intended readers to get from these writings were often different, but he had the courage to admit his mistakes. In the decade after the end of the European War, he felt that the world had the opportunity to get rid of disaster. Although he was temporarily encouraged and excited, embracing new ideals and new hopes for transforming the world, and was recognized as a leader of intellectual movements, he soon relapsed into old ways and gradually abandoned their new efforts, feeling great pain in his heart. He also foresaw that the League of Nations would only discuss and not have the real power to act, not only failing to achieve peace but also risking the intensification of nationalism. Therefore, the ideals he had in the past gradually disappeared in his writings. However, in the first few years, he still held a compassionate heart and did his best to express the ability of idealism in the two books "The Salvaging of Civilization" (1921) and "Men Like Gods," which were considered by many admirers to be the most lovely dreams of the paradise that mankind could imagine. His subsequent writings, however, returned to the severe reprimands he had made to society in his early years, such as "The Dream" (1924), "Christina Alberta's Father" (1925), "Democracy Under Revision" (1927), "The Sorbonne Lectures," "Meanwhile" (1927), "Mr. Blettsworthy on Rampole Island," "The Way the World is Going" (1928), "The Autocracy of Mr. Parham" (1930), "After Democracy" (1932), and "The Bulpington of Blup" (1933). These all prove that although this enthusiastic reformer and idealist did not lose his true colors as Wells in general, his faith in humanity had been shaken. But his genius was not damaged by this, and his perseverance was not weakened by it. He had an early ambition to write about the great history of mankind. He was not afraid of the difficulty of the task and finally completed his plan with a trilogy after the war. The first part is a broad narrative of the actions of people in the past, which is "The Outline of History" (published in 1920, this book sold 1.5 million copies, making Wells rich). Followed by "The Science of Life" (published in 1929, this book was co-authored with G.P. Wells and Julian Huxley), which details the evolution of life; the final great achievement is "The Work, Wealth &amp; Happiness of Mankind" (1932), which is an outline of social science.</p>
<p>Wells's philosophy, first seen in the book "Anticipations," after years of changes, is again in "The World of William Clissold" (published in 1926, three volumes). "The Open Conspiracy" (published in 1928, Wells called this the blueprint for world revolution, dedicated to the future of transforming the world). And his autobiography "Experiment in Autobiography" (published in 1934, although it is an autobiography, it is not specifically about himself, Wells called this an autobiography experiment - the discovery and conclusions of an ordinary person's brain after 1866.) make a more thorough exposure.</p>
<p>Lightning Intelligence</p>
<p>The reason why Wells was admired by his contemporaries was entirely due to his exciting and attention-grabbing thoughts. Few writers could write about so many issues like him, and even fewer could stir readers like him. He also had a nearly unmatched ability to make people feel that what he said was not only worth saying but should be said. Although he lacked true doubt about things, his ability to criticize was surprisingly great. She can also use lightning-like intelligence to illuminate the darkest things. He is rich in judgment, does not overstate any element, and does not underestimate its value. He uses a great and bold style to move people's hearts, or to make them expect, or to make them fear, or to make them rise up, or to make them be discouraged. He uses the ability of a great craftsman to make them fit the universe. He let many people in the world know that he hated their stupidity, and at the same time, he could convey his love for the world. This is probably Wells's greatest success.</p>
<p>Wells was an internationalist. He felt that the trivial disputes that occurred in the superficial countries in terms of economics and politics were the main reason for the desolation in the ancient world and might ruin the world's civilization in the future. He devoted his life to the creation of the World Federation and advocated that countries should sacrifice a part of their sovereignty, but he did not agree with the use of the theory of democratic politics to achieve this goal. His socialism is scientific and biological, not economic and political. His political thought has been consistent from the beginning. He firmly believes that the reforms he wants should be led and implemented by an enlightened minority, and its success can easily come from the intelligence of the masses or the sound planning of the masses. Therefore, he believes in the heads of great business organizations and scientists and technicians. He feels that these people contain the cells of the world revolution he advocates. They only need to follow the procedure, do their conscience, and use everything they have already grasped to obtain power. The Wells Society (H.G. Wells Society) established in 1929 was established based on this basis. He believes that all nations in the world must unite and cooperate in order to ensure human safety in the scientific age.</p>
<p>Unlike many fantasy writers, Wells is equally active in social and spiritual life. In 1934, he went to the United States to meet with President Roosevelt, and then went to Moscow to meet with Marshal Stalin. He was disappointed to see that Russia's socialism had turned into a dictatorship. The outbreak of this world war shattered his beautiful dreams of world peace and progress, and his mood deteriorated day by day. He saw that the power of science was not given to visionary people to increase human wisdom, but was held in the hands of powerful people to make destructive weapons such as atomic bombs. This was already predicted in his book "The World Set Free" published in 1914, and it unexpectedly became a reality. Therefore, he wrote "Mind at the End of Its Tether" last year, writing off many of the optimism he had previously held, and declaring the doom of mankind when mankind needed hope and courage. This is the most depressing of all his writings.</p>
<p>In short, the scope of his vision, the extent of his erudition, his intelligence, infinite flexibility, his diligence, tireless, his arguments, incisive, Wells relied on these to create his greatness. Few people can maintain their innovation tendency and their common sense in their old age, and even fewer can always embrace "humanitarianism" like Wells.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Praise</p>
<p>Wells has been praised by many celebrities during his lifetime. Now I will record several kinds as follows:</p>
<p>Brown: "Wells thinks extremely fast, so he often cannot stand still to consolidate the position he has won. Therefore, although his socialism continues to promote and often shines brightly, it is also often disconnected."</p>
<p>Brooks: "Wells is an intellectual, not an artist. This means that he naturally grasps and explains life in terms of ideals, not in terms of experience."</p>
<p>McCarthy: "Wells has freed young men and women in narrow environments from the terrible shackles of inherited old etiquette and replaced them with greater wishes and another kind of respect. His efforts are greater than anyone else."</p>
<p>Shaw's comments after Wells's death are of course even more accurate. He said: "Wells is not a gentleman. He cannot and does not want to have this status. He is the son of a gardener and a doorkeeper, so there is no class. His behavior is never like a gentleman, or a shop assistant, or a school teacher, but he has spent these lives. He is unique and never imitates others. How admirable he is! He is mild-mannered. Although he glared at all of us, none of us resented him. I remember about fifty years ago, Wells and I had a dispute over the policies implemented by the left-wing Fabian Society. I easily made him completely defeated, but the members of the society, although not giving him a vote, blamed me for not being so reckless and expressed their sympathy to him. If he had always been a very alert and self-controlled person, he would not be as loved and respected as he is today."</p>
<h3>A Visit to Ai Sha, Member of the Xinjiang Provincial Committee, on the Prohibition of Marriage Between Hui and Han</h3>
<p>— Lanzhou Airmail Dispatch, 16th, Zhang Shihao</p>
<p>In this unstable situation, who is not concerned about the problem of Xinjiang, especially in Gansu, which is related to it like lips and teeth, in people's minds. The day before yesterday evening, at the fourth Municipal Joint Friendship Meeting of all circles in Lanzhou, hosted by the Gansu Branch of the Youth League in the Anti-Japanese Construction Hall in this city, the reporter discovered eight or nine burly men in the official seats, wearing flat-topped, eight-cornered embroidered caps. The leading general was an old friend whom I hadn't seen for almost a year—Mr. Ai Sha. This joy was truly extraordinary.</p>
<h3>Entering the Central Government and Contributing Greatly</h3>
<p>Although Mr. Ai Sha is a genuine compatriot, he speaks very fluent Mandarin. During the War of Resistance, he and Mr. Maswood always entered the central government and were stationed in Chongqing, acting as a bridge between Xinjiang and the central government, running around for the Hui people, and serving the country. His achievements are well-known and worthy of our admiration and praise.</p>
<p>Accompanying Mr. Ai Sha, in addition to his son, were five representatives of the Xinjiang Youth League and two gentlemen who were investigating education and drama. The group of nine flew to Lanzhou the day before yesterday and will attend the second National Congress of the Youth League in Lushan. They had just gotten off the plane and rested in the Northwest Building before rushing to participate in the friendship evening, as honored guests of the meeting. Chief Secretary Song delivered a special welcome speech to introduce them to the guests, and Secretary Kou personally came forward to serve as the host. The guests were enjoying the art, and the reporter did not want to disturb them too much. After a brief greeting, they agreed to have a pleasant chat at the Northwest Building at eight o'clock the next morning.</p>
<h3>Abuse of Power and Forced Marriage</h3>
<p>The time to visit Mr. Ai Sha arrived. Ai Sha had just gotten up and was washing his face, so the reporter chatted with Little Ai Sha. He is not yet fifteen years old and has been studying in Chongqing all along. He came home to play for a few days this time and is now going back to school. He is very innocent, just like Ai Sha. Mr. Ai Sha came in less than five minutes, and the reporter began to talk to this talkative veteran. The reporter first inquired about the inside story of the recent shocking event at home and abroad of prohibiting marriage between Hui and Han. He told the reporter very frankly that the marriage problem between Hui and Han was not very serious, but in recent years, the situation has deteriorated day by day. New military, civilians, and officials from the mainland mostly used their power to oppress Xinjiang women and force them to marry, which aroused the resentment of the Xinjiang people. No matter what, the people of Xinjiang would rather die than have their sisters marry mainlanders. The problem was so serious that the people of the whole province resolutely asked the central government to prohibit marriage between Hui and Han. A few days ago, they automatically launched a universal movement. All Xinjiang women who had married mainlanders since the 32nd year of the Republic of China were dragged out of the mainlanders' homes and locked in mosques to await religious disposal.</p>
<h3>Enterprise Company Hoarding Agency</h3>
<p>Secondly, talking about the dissolution of the Xinjiang Enterprise Company, he believed that the Enterprise Company was completely an organization that hoarded goods, monopolized the market, and destroyed private business. Therefore, the people of Xinjiang unanimously opposed its existence.</p>
<p>As for the Yining Incident, fortunately, Chairman Zhang's far-sighted policy resolved it, and the order and security of various places have now returned to normal, but the people's lives are much more difficult than during the War of Resistance. Prices are soaring step by step, which is terrifying. Private businesses are mostly on the verge of bankruptcy. This has almost become a common phenomenon in the country, but Xinjiang is even more serious. Speaking of military discipline, he believes that it is really necessary to strengthen it.</p>
<p>Mr. Ai Sha stood up excitedly when he talked about the wishes of the people of Xinjiang. He believes that what the people of the mainland need, the people of Xinjiang also need; what the people of the United States need, the people of Xinjiang also need. The people of Xinjiang are willing to live in a new Xinjiang; to be honest, they do not hope that the Xinjiang of Sheng Shicai's era will reappear. Xinjiang needs scientific construction projects, universal education, a stable life for the people, a army that protects the country and defends the people, officials who love the people like their own children, and good people from the mainland who are as close as flesh and blood. Under such circumstances, he dares to guarantee that the people of Xinjiang are willing to join the embrace of the motherland.</p>
<h3>Striving for Construction Instead of Propaganda</h3>
<p>As for Chairman Zhang Zhizhong, the people of Xinjiang have a very good impression of him, and at the same time, they place endless hope on him as if he were a savior. Although their ideal demands have not yet been realized, they also know that Chairman Zhang has not been in charge for a long time, and whether his cadres can cooperate with his work cannot be fully confirmed, but no matter what, Chairman Zhang is a good chairman and a true representative of Chairman Chiang. The people of Xinjiang always believe that Chairman Zhang will be able to do well and realize their wishes. Finally, Mr. Ai Sha talked about the independence of Outer Mongolia and the strong neighbors surrounding it. The border issues should be closely watched. The government should not only pay attention to the tangible national defense construction but also strengthen the construction of intangible national defense, replacing propaganda with construction. Xinjiang's natural conditions are very sufficient. No matter what, all construction projects must be accelerated, otherwise, the centripetal force of the people of Xinjiang may have problems in the future.</p>
<p>The talking time was long, and Mr. Ai Sha wanted to have an early meal, so the reporter took this opportunity to say goodbye.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes from Taiwan Province</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun, Taipei Air Dispatch, 15th</p>
<p>There used to be 200,000 Japanese in Taiwan. More than 100,000 of them have been repatriated to their country, and some technical personnel are staying here, preparing to be repatriated in four batches before December. After these people leave, the number of mainlanders who come to replace them will be at most 30,000. Normally, there shouldn't be a housing panic. However, in reality, most of the people from the mainland cannot find housing, and Taiwan is also experiencing a housing shortage. This seems like a joke, but it is a fact. Chief Chen explained that the inconvenience of housing gives them a bad impression. He said, "Instead of sending people to other provinces to promote Taiwan, it is better to make things easier for visitors, so they can become voluntary promoters when they return!" Solving the housing problem for mainlanders is indeed a problem.</p>
<p>Ammonium Sulfate Like Pepper</p>
<p>The rice and sugarcane in this province both need fertilizer. The Japanese call it "sulfate of ammonia," also known as ammonium sulfate, especially for rice. There is a very strong habit of fertilizing rice and sugarcane with ammonium sulfate. The Relief Administration transported 3,000 tons from Canada. According to Director Qian, if this were to be supplied to the entire province, it would be like sprinkling pepper. After the experts decided, this time it will be sold at a low price of eight yuan per pound to farmers in areas south of Chiayi, with a standard of 125 pounds (56 kilograms) per hectare, which can be distributed to 44,534.2 hectares, potentially increasing rice production by 20,000 tons. However, Director Qian said: when it will come again and how much will come are both problems. The Japanese colonial economic policy was to supply Taiwan with ammonium sulfate, but the factories were in Kumamoto and Osaka. Taiwan does not have any. According to his report, it is impossible to consider distributing it to sugarcane farmers in addition to rice.</p>
<p>According to agricultural experts, due to the lack of fertilizer, the first crop of this year's food production in this province has decreased to one-third to two-fifths of the normal yield. In the past, the annual rice yield was about 200 "ying hu" per hectare, and wheat was 75 "ying hu." Now, at most, it can only harvest 66 "ying hu" of rice and 50 "ying hu" of wheat. A clear example is that rice stalks used to be three feet five inches long, but now they are shortened to two feet five inches, and eight-inch rice panicles have shrunk to five inches.</p>
<p>Using Cars to Go to School</p>
<p>Chief Chen said: Using public cars to send children to school is not love but rather a way to spoil children. Therefore, the police bureau began to crack down on officials using cars to pick up and drop off children at school.</p>
<p>Because Beitou, a hot spring area, is a good place to go, it is common to use office cars to take wives and children to play. The chief said this needs to be done carefully because Japanese officials were frowned upon for doing so in the past.</p>
<p>The Situation of the Taiwan Medical Association</p>
<p>The Taiwan Medical Association, which has a history of 46 years, held a general meeting last month and decided to reorganize into a group of private medical and pharmaceutical workers. It will be the province's leading medical research institution, recruiting more than 300 of the province's most outstanding doctors and medical professionals. It was decided to hold a regular meeting once a month and a general meeting once a year to give academic lectures and report on research results. The association has 25 directors, and Dr. Du Tingming was publicly elected as the chairman. According to Dr. Du, the association is the only national organization in the country that studies tropical medicine and publishes a magazine with a total of 44 volumes. Recently, in addition to continuing publication, it also hosted a plague research conference on the 20th of this month, with Dr. Horiuchi and Dr. Maruyama lecturing on immune pathology, Professor Morishita lecturing on wind seeds, and Professor Aoki lecturing on rat tales, etc. The association hopes that domestic medical experts will exchange research and discuss with each other. The address of the association is located in the College of Medicine of National Taiwan University.</p>

<p>Wishing to Reward Those with Integrity and Loyalty</p>
<p>Editor: Victory has been a year now! In this past year, some traitors have been punished, but some are still at large. This is partly because most Chinese people hold the traditional view of "sweeping the snow in front of one's own door"; on the other hand, because prosecuting traitors requires evidence, no one wants to bother if it doesn't concern them.</p>
<p>As for rewarding integrity, I haven't heard of it until now. I am now proposing that "punishing traitors" and "rewarding integrity" are two sides of the same coin. It is also an urgent matter to correct the decadent atmosphere. Therefore, I offer my humble opinion, hoping to attract the attention of the public opinion and the society's worthy people and the authorities.</p>
<p>I believe that traitors, regardless of their size, should be handed over to the judiciary. Law enforcers should weigh the facts and make a judgment. A murderer should be put to death! Those who trample on human rights or extort and make a fortune during national crises should have all their property confiscated in addition to being sentenced. The confiscated illegal property should be used to compensate the victims' losses, and the remainder should be used for national economic recovery or relief funds; at the same time, a portion should be provided to help impoverished people with integrity and loyalty or their surviving families.</p>
<p>I believe that people with integrity and loyalty are the essence of cosmic righteousness and the soul of the nation. Leaders advocated integrity before the War of Resistance. I hope that the government authorities will implement the rewarding of integrity at the same time as punishing traitors. A special investigation committee should be organized to investigate on the one hand and order governments at all levels and people in society to recommend or self-recommend on the other hand. Those who are confirmed to have integrity and loyalty should be comforted by high officials and given honorary awards, so that they will be honored in life and mourned in death, and their surviving families will be taken care of. This may be the legacy of King Yan's buying of horse bones and building a platform to attract Guo Wei!</p>
<p>Originally, a person should be good, and should not be bad. Goodness should not be rewarded; badness should be punished. However, in this present society where ethics are lax and morality is lost, there are fewer righteous people with integrity and loyalty. In order to promote inherent morality, it should be greatly emphasized. (Liu Tong)</p>
<p>Appealing for Overseas Chinese from Fujian Province</p>
<p>Editor: The Fujian Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Office began registering and applying for passports in early February, and it has been more than six months, but the repatriation has not yet begun. During the outbreak of the Pacific War, we were unwilling to be obedient citizens of the enemy, so we abandoned our property and escaped from under the enemy's iron hoof. Along the way, we were grateful for the government's relief and were able to arrive safely in our hometown. Currently, the cost of living in Fujian Province is high, and it is difficult to make a living. In five years, our capital has been exhausted, and our lives are extremely difficult. We don't know where we can settle down? With sincere opinions, we appeal to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Overseas Department and the responsible officials of various institutions such as the Executive Yuan's Relief Administration to quickly send ships for free repatriation, so that tens of thousands of overseas Chinese can return to their original places of residence to revitalize their old businesses. If we don't urgently find a way to send ships for repatriation, what prospects can we imagine! (Respectfully submitted by Ye Guoquan)</p>
<p>Measures for Handling Damaged Small Denomination Notes</p>
<p>Approved on August 15th, General Reading No. 175 letter, in accordance with your newspaper reader Mr. Yu Kexin's letter, which has something to say about the recovery of damaged small denomination notes. A copy of the original letter is attached for your reference. We have already understood and are deeply grateful. The explanation is as follows: (1) Small denomination notes in various places have already been collected as much as possible. After being exchanged, they will no longer be issued. (2) Damaged banknotes, in addition to entrusting provincial banks in various places to exchange them, we have also signed a contract with the Postal Remittance Bureau to entrust postal bureaus across the country to exchange them. Corresponding reply, please check and understand. Sincerely, The Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank</p>
<p>The Fragrance of Bread Fills the Air, Endangering the Lives of Lodgers</p>
<p>We are a group of lodgers living upstairs in the second section of buildings above the Qishilin Bakery near the Racecourse. Within this small space, more than 20 people live, and in this hot weather, we already have the feeling of "not being able to breathe."</p>
<p>Who knew that the Qishilin Bakery downstairs only cares about making money and doesn't care about the lives of others? They have set up industrial stoves downstairs to make bread and produce various kinds of pasta. The stoves are burning all day long, and the room is filled with coal ash! Conversely, the lives of a group of people living upstairs are in a furnace in hot weather that is already around 100 degrees, like a group of dying lives.</p>
<p>We have a sense of doubt. If the stove fire is accidentally negligent, these 20 or so people will be sacrificed for them. We are also worried about one thing, that is, fortunately, there is no fire, so as to avoid heatstroke or illness.</p>
<p>This is a cry for the attention of the fire department. If we can get safety, we will be sincerely grateful. (Er Liang)</p>
<p>Why is There a Horse Trap Pit Here?</p>
<p>Editor: At about 8 o'clock at night, I finished visiting a friend at Fuyou Road, Danfeng Road, South City, and planned to return north via Minguo Road. Unexpectedly, when I was about to reach the eastern section of Fuyou Road, my feet suddenly stepped into the air and fell into a large hole in the road, which was half a body deep. I really fell in a strange way! With broken skin and blood flowing, I supported myself and endured the pain, and especially drafted this article to ask: (1) Since there is such a large deep pit in the road, why didn't the shops and residents on both sides report to the competent authorities? Even if not for the sake of passing pedestrians, shouldn't they be for their own safety? (2) Such a large deep pit, haven't the police officers who maintain law and order seen it? (3) The authorities directly responsible for road administration, if they are carrying out construction for building ditches, why not block it with wooden frames to warn of the danger? Of course, red lights should be lit in the evening, but now none of them have been seen. I can't help but wonder, "What is the purpose of digging this horse trap pit in the road!" (Fang Chunlei)</p>

<h3>If World War III Occurs, North America Will Become the Battlefield. Canadian General Discusses the Importance of U.S.-Canada Joint Defense</h3>
<p>— Translated by Chun from Saturday Evening Post</p>
<p>In this atomic age, defending North America requires establishing completely new concepts and skills for national defense.</p>
<p>Whose business is this?</p>
<p>It is not the sole business of Canada or the United States. Defending North America requires not only coordinating the national defense policies of the U.S. and Canada, but also a complete coordination of the two countries' military forces, weapons, supplies, deployments, and so on.</p>
<p>The existing U.S.-Canada joint defense relationship was created in 1939, when both sides agreed to provide mutual assistance in times of emergency. Under this principle, a permanent joint defense council was created. However, its task is entirely consultative in nature, without any defensive power. If such a joint defense mechanism continues, it can only create a false sense of "false security" and will not help in reality. If someone invades North America today, it will not be resisted by a united military force, but by two independent military units that cannot coordinate or exchange weapons.</p>
<p>During the recently concluded war, the U.S. and Canada hastily did some work to defend North America. Canada built many airfields. The United States also rushed to build a 1,671-mile Alaska Highway in the Canadian tundra to protect Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. The United States also built pipelines to refine oil for Canada. However, today, no one uses that highway, and the pipeline is also rusted. Last fall, the bases near the oil wells were piled high with various U.S. military equipment because the shipping costs were too high.</p>
<p>However, these hasty experiments at least had some effect. As a result, the Japanese army was defeated, and the transportation of troops and supplies was smooth. To this day, many generals still talk about the Aleutian campaign with fear. However, due to military censorship, the general public thought it was just an unimportant episode. In fact, if it weren't for good luck, North America might have become a bloody battlefield, and the enemy might have been able to invade, set up air bases, and plan to bomb U.S. industrial centers. Or the enemy might even bomb Great Bear Lake in Canada, destroying the only domestic source of uranium, which would be serious!</p>
<p>The Aleutian campaign also left other lessons for the U.S.-Canada joint defense officers to consider. Because the equipment of both sides was different and the calibers of the weapons were different, all supply systems had to be duplicated. At the same time, the two sides could not use some important materials interchangeably. Sometimes, due to transportation reasons, there would be a phenomenon that one side was under-equipped and unable to fight, while the other side had a surplus.</p>
<p>Many generals unanimously believe that if World War III occurs within 50 years, North America will be the battlefield. The opinion expressed by Admiral Jones, Chief of Staff of the Canadian Navy, shortly before his death, can represent the general opinion of generals. He said:</p>
<p>"The Allied victory in World War II relied on the extraordinary production quantity and speed of U.S. industry. Otherwise, the landing in Europe and the expulsion of German troops from Russia would not have been possible. Therefore, in another major war, the aggressor will definitely attack U.S. industrial centers such as Pittsburgh, Detroit, etc. first. And the enemy will most likely use air strikes. In this case, the situation of Canada can be self-evident."</p>
<p>The Key to U.S.-Canada Joint Defense</p>
<p>The key to the U.S.-Canada joint defense issue, from the Canadian perspective, lies in public opinion. Whether this plan can be realized depends on how the people view it.</p>
<p>Canadians who are generally considered "imperialists" oppose joint defense, calling it a bad policy of selling out the country. The old men left over from World War I also disagree. They think, is Canada still Canada with this? Even if they are told that this is how it has been in the past and still is now, learning from Great Britain and acting as her wing, they may reluctantly agree, but they will always feel that working for the Americans is another matter.</p>
<p>But I have discussed joint defense with all kinds of people in the United League, and their ideas are very realistic. Every veteran of World War II unhesitatingly supports the closest U.S.-Canada military integration. Only the residents of south-central Ontario (where loyalists immigrated during the American Revolution, and the residents still maintain a pro-British attitude) fiercely oppose joint defense.</p>
<p>Canada has 3.5 million French-speaking citizens. In both World Wars, they opposed participating in the war and opposed their young people dying for England. Speaking of U.S.-Canada joint defense, a bank manager can represent the general opinion of the residents: "We know that we cannot defend our country alone. Many of us do not recognize that fighting the European war is the best way to protect the country. But we all feel that joint defense with the United States is a matter of course. This powerful neighbor has the same purpose as us, which is to defend."</p>
<p>To re-establish Canada's national defense policy, it is not enough to simply reorganize the army. The relationship between Canadian industry and the United States is inseparable. About factories such as Ford, General Motors, Westinghouse, and General Electric are all affiliated with U.S. headquarters. The employed administrative and technical personnel are also trained and sent by the headquarters. As it is now, if Britain participates in the war, these factories will have to switch to wartime production and manufacture British-style weapons.</p>
<p>Less than a year into World War II, we saw very clearly that it was impossible to implement military coordination across 3,000 miles of ocean controlled by the enemy. When the British army retreated from Dunkirk, some naval warplanes were recalled on their way to Canada. As a result, Canada had training bases and airframes, but no engines. For example, in the Atlantic fleet, there were warships launched in Canadian shipyards without armed escorts because Canada did not have cannons at the time, and the sizes built by the United States were not suitable. In 1939, the United States borrowed Canadian long-range cannons for coastal defense. To find targets, shells also had to be sent because the caliber of the Canadian factory was not suitable. There were so many things like this in 1940 and 1941 that it is impossible to list them all.</p>
<p>Difficult to Implement the Plan</p>
<p>When the war was about to end, Canadian factories were still rushing to build British-style machinery. When peace came, these factories immediately began to switch to the American mass production method to manufacture American products. If there is another war, they will have to change the production methods again, and the loss in terms of efficiency will be too great.</p>
<p>The Chief of Staff of the Canadian Navy, Army, and Air Force are all very clear about the future of national defense issues; they know that the traditional old methods are not enough to meet the new needs. At the same time, the Canadian army is also trying to meet the U.S. standards, waiting for the U.S. and Canadian governments to have a further understanding and a definite policy.</p>
<p>Currently, the Canadian Navy already has plans for joint exercises with the U.S. Navy. The air forces of both sides are also preparing for joint exercises. The two countries also exchange instructors, hoping to learn more from each other as a result.</p>
<p>However, British-made aircraft will continue to be the mainstay of the Canadian Air Force. The caliber of the bullets is still not standardized. The Canadian army still has to follow the British way of doing things.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Fergus, Chief of Staff of the Canadian Army, said it best: "If we want to do it well, the most important issue is to seek coordination. If both sides have every weapon, its caliber must be exactly the same. The names used must also be exactly the same. For example, the word "division," in terms of the number of people and combat power, both sides must have a completely same understanding."</p>
<p>If the war had ended later, the U.S. and Canada, as allies, might have already realized this joint defense plan. Now, it is much more difficult. The general public is tired of war, and it is difficult to be interested in future military issues. People who eat political food will certainly not loudly advocate for this issue.</p>
<p>From a military perspective, the most effective way to resist these new weapons, such as atomic bombs, is to use similar or even more complete new weapons. And if the enemy attacks large cities such as New York and Chicago, this side can immediately dispatch forces to bomb the aggressor's industrial centers into flat ground.</p>
<p>In this case, it is clear that to comprehensively plan the defense of North America, Canada's need for the United States and the United States' need for Canada are one and two, and two and one, absolutely inseparable.</p>
<p>Canadian national defense industry area The train is busy transporting, the work is tense.</p>
<h3>Flying Wing - Capabilities Exceeding Super Fortress</h3>
<p>— Translated by Gang Ren from Popular Science Magazine</p>
<p>Carrying an amazing number of bombs, flying a quarter of the way around the globe, and being able to return without landing, this is the performance of the newly manufactured Flying Wing aircraft that enriches the U.S. Air Force.</p>
<p>The reason it is called a Flying Wing is because it has huge wings that are different from ordinary aircraft. The wingspan is 172 feet, and it weighs 104.5 tons when fully loaded. Compared with the B-29 Super Fortress, which weighs 65 tons, the load capacity is about doubled.</p>
<p>The Flying Wing was designed and manufactured by Northrop Aircraft Factory. It uses four Pratt &amp; Whitney engines, with a total horsepower of 1,200 horsepower. Each engine has a Hamilton-made "push-type" propeller. The propeller is also specially made, with two four-bladed propellers coaxial and with a reverse device, so that when the "Flying Wing" lands, the two propellers rotate in opposite directions to reduce the "taxiing distance" of the "Flying Wing" on the ground.</p>
<p>There are pressurized rooms in the wings that can accommodate 15 people. There are also nine positions for managers, communicators, etc., and three gunner seats. There are also variable "chair beds" in the small room.</p>
<p>When parked on the ground, it is 20 feet high and the whole body is carried on five wheels. The movement is controlled by a three-tooth gear with a diameter of five feet six inches and four feet eight inches. The middle section of the wings is thirty-seven and a half feet wide, gradually tapering towards the wingtips.</p>
<p>Just looking at this Flying Wing, we can see from its appearance that there has indeed been a great innovation in aircraft engineering.</p>
<p>The facts tell us that the people in charge of design and manufacturing studied it for 23 years and spent millions of hours doing various tests and experimental test flights, as well as engineering discussions. John Northrop's first formal experimental Flying Wing was held in 1923. He knew that it was worth working hard to study, so he made continuous tests and improvements. See the article "Flying Wing in Success" in the March 1942 issue (Popular Science). Now, this first test flight of the N-1-M Flying Wing is displayed in the Wright Field Museum for people to visit.</p>
<p>Northrop not only managed to solve the various problems of the huge wings but also eliminated the tail of ordinary aircraft, becoming this innovative Flying Wing. The elevator rudder and the direction rudder are combined into an "elevon." In terms of control, there are also strange "louvered holes" at the rear of the wings, which eliminate the smooth flow of air during slow-speed flight and obtain normal control, and can automatically open and close at high speeds. These are enough to increase its aviation efficiency.</p>
<p>Equipped with appropriate gun mounts, it has a powerful firepower net to protect safety. The following is a comparison table between it and the B-29, which makes us feel that the "Flying Wing" is obviously a further step in aviation!</p>

<h3>From the Perspective of Anglo-Soviet Relations: The Turkish Straits Issue is Not a Matter of Revising the Montreux Convention, But a Manifestation of the Anglo-Soviet Power Struggle</h3>
<p>— Zhu Jingxin</p>
<p>The Soviet Union, disregarding the stipulations of the Montreux Convention regarding the Straits, suddenly notified the Turkish government, demanding that the two countries conduct separate negotiations to alter the legal status of the Dardanelles Strait. This immediately heightened tensions in the Near East. Demanding the revision of international treaties due to changes in the international situation is a very common and reasonable thing, not something to be alarmed about or excessively emphasized. However, the Soviet Union's long-standing demand for joint Soviet-Turkish defense of the Straits area, and its ambition to exclude British influence, are well-known facts. Therefore, the Soviet demand, once put forward, caused alarm in various countries, making everyone more convinced that the Straits issue is not a simple one, and that besides being directly related to the Soviet Union and Turkey, there are also extremely complex and subtle international undercurrents. Although Britain has handled this matter with caution and has not taken the initiative to make any claims, the Soviet move is aimed at Britain and will not be relaxed.</p>
<p>According to a Moscow dispatch from Agence France-Presse on the 25th, the Soviet radio station even broadcast the news that Britain had established military bases in the Straits area, and claimed that Britain had built "radar stations" there to closely monitor submarine activity. Whether this report is true or not, it is sufficient to prove that Anglo-Soviet antagonism in Turkey has reached a fever pitch. Therefore, the Straits issue is not merely a legal issue, but has become a diplomatic war for Anglo-Soviet supremacy in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The Lausanne Conference and the Montreux Convention</p>
<p>During the First World War, Turkey sided with Germany in the war. By the end of the war, Turkey had lost a large amount of territory. Constantinople was occupied by the armies of the Great Powers, and Greek troops invaded the coastal areas of Asia Minor. The Kuomintang leader Kemal seized the opportunity to rise, and the Ottoman Empire disintegrated. The newly emerged Turkish Republic was confined to a corner of Asia Minor. Fortunately, under Kemal's leadership, after several struggles, considerable achievements were made in domestic politics, economy, culture, and construction. At the same time, the Greek army was repelled, and İzmir was retaken, pushing the border to the Balkan Peninsula, and Turkey's international status was slightly increased.</p>
<p>After the Turkish-Greek War, Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and the Balkan countries signed the Treaty of Lausanne at the Lausanne Conference in July 1923, abolishing the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles and recognizing the restoration of Turkish territory. In 1936, Turkey notified the signatory countries of the Treaty of Lausanne, requesting revision of the clauses regarding the demilitarization and free passage of the Dardanelles Strait. As a result, Britain, France, Japan, Russia, Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey held a conference in Montreux, where Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü proposed a new draft convention. A new treaty was signed to replace the Lausanne Treaty of that day, and Turkey was able to rearm the Straits.</p>
<p>Turkey's Activities During World War II</p>
<p>When the Second World War began, of all the Allied countries that had sided with Germany in the First World War, only Turkey did not side with her again. In particular, the signing of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement brought great gains to the Allied Nations. The Foreign Minister at this time was the current President İnönü, whose policy was pro-British and American. After Kemal's death in 1938, he succeeded him as President and continued to maintain his consistent policy. In early 1941, the Nazis cut off Britain's oil supply in the Near East, blockaded the Suez Canal, and fostered a pro-Axis regime in Iraq. The Vichy government also directed French troops to fight in Syria, and the Dodecanese Islands were an Italian air base. At this time, Turkey was surrounded by Axis powers. The Nazis put forward the request to Turkey to transit to the Middle East, but Turkey did not yield and resolutely refused. They also mobilized the national army to prepare for any eventuality, and Germany could do nothing about it.</p>
<p>Soviet-Turkish Relations After World War II</p>
<p>Historically, Soviet-Turkish relations have been unfriendly. Although Turkey maintained neutrality for a considerable period during the Second World War, and declared war on Germany three months before Germany surrendered, from the Soviet Union's point of view, Turkey's relations with Germany were always too close. In March of last year, the Soviet Union notified Turkey of the termination of the Soviet-Turkish Treaty of Friendship signed in 1925.</p>
<p>After the end of the war, Turkey's diplomatic situation remained tense. From the Soviet Union's point of view, the termination of the Soviet-Turkish Treaty of Friendship was considered that in the current changing situation, this treaty needed to be revised. On the Turkish side, they also hoped to reconcile with the Soviet Union. The Soviet ambassador held a meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister in June of last year, and the Soviet government proposed three preconditions for signing a new treaty: (1) Kars and Ardahan, which were ceded to Turkey in 1921, should be returned to the Soviet Union. (2) The Soviet Union should be allowed to establish bases in the Black Sea Straits and participate in the defense of the Straits. (3) The Montreux Convention should be revised. Such negotiations were of course impossible to carry out. In December, the situation on the Soviet-Turkish border was once very tense, and the Turkish people also held demonstrations. However, the Turkish Foreign Minister stated that under the condition of "not seeking or giving," he was extremely willing to reconcile with the Soviet Union. In March of this year, the old matter was brought up again, and the Soviet Union notified Turkey that no alliance treaty could be signed until the issues of Kars and Ardahan and the Dardanelles Strait were resolved.</p>
<p>Turkey cannot easily agree to the Soviet demands. Territorial integrity must be maintained, and the Dardanelles Strait is not something that Turkey can decide alone. During the Second World War, German submarines in the Black Sea were very active, and the skies over Bulgaria and Romania were also full of airplanes, so that Soviet ships could not pass through the Straits. This was Turkey's reason for replying to the Soviet Union, and finally postponed the matter.</p>
<p>The Sudden Soviet Demand</p>
<p>On August 8, the Soviet Union submitted a memorandum to Turkey, requesting the revision of the Montreux Convention, believing that the administrative power of the Dardanelles Strait should be placed under the management of the Black Sea countries, and that the Soviet Union and Turkey should jointly be responsible for the defense of the Straits. The Soviet Foreign Ministry also announced that it had copied two documents from the German Foreign Ministry archives. The first was Germany's policy towards the Soviet Union from 1937 to 1943. The second was Germany's policy towards Turkey from 1941 to 1943. In the one about Turkey, it was discovered that Turkey was using the name of neutrality to help Germany and harbored ill intentions to be hostile to the Soviet Union. Fortunately, the Soviet Union was victorious and was able to eliminate Turkey's conspiracy, so the Soviet Union requested the revision of the Montreux Convention, using this as an excuse.</p>
<p>After Turkey received the Soviet note, political figures generally believed that it was unacceptable. All newspapers pointed out the seriousness of the situation, and the cabinet held an emergency meeting to deal with it, rejecting the request and insisting that the jurisdiction of the Dardanelles Strait should be decided by the Montreux Convention mechanism. The claim that Turkey violated the Convention during the war was also refuted, and it was stated that it could not sign a new agreement with a few countries to replace the 1936 Convention. The Turkish government will continue to abide by the Convention, considering it the only diplomatic document governing the Straits and not allowing it to be violated.</p>
<p>All Parties Pay Attention to the Attitude of the Great Powers</p>
<p>The issue of the Dardanelles Strait is by no means a matter between the Soviet Union and Turkey. All countries along the Black Sea coast are directly related to the Straits. The countries that signed the Montreux Convention will not stand idly by. If an international conference is convened due to the revision of the Montreux Convention, Japan, Romania, and Bulgaria may not have the opportunity to attend because they fought on the side of the Axis powers. The United States will inevitably participate. In this way, the Soviet Union will inevitably cause diplomatic conflicts with Western countries. Therefore, this matter cannot be negotiated by the Soviet Union and Turkey. The Soviet Union advocates that the countries along the Black Sea coast jointly solve the problem. The so-called countries along the Black Sea coast are: Romania and Bulgaria. However, Romania and Bulgaria are now little more than vassals of the Soviet Union. It is obvious that the intention is to exclude the Montreux Convention signatory countries that are not along the Black Sea coast, so that Turkey alone must deal with this issue.</p>
<p>Since receiving the Soviet demands, Turkey has consulted closely with Western countries. The British and American ambassadors to Turkey have been in frequent contact with the Turkish Foreign Minister, and the French ambassador to Turkey has also visited the Turkish Foreign Minister for consultations, which shows the attention of various countries to this matter. It is said that at the Potsdam Conference, an agreement was reached on the need to reconsider the Montreux Convention. However, Britain and the United States will never agree to the Soviet Union's current approach, so they issued statements on the 14th and 15th, stating that they could not accept it. They believe that the Soviet Union's demand to jointly defend this important waterway with Turkey is equivalent to demanding a military base in Turkey, and its actions seem to be restoring 19th-century diplomacy.</p>
<p>Britain supports Turkey in opposing the Soviet Union's demands on the Straits, but in view of the similar situation of the Suez Canal, it advocates a compromise to meet the Soviet Union's security requirements, that is, to include it in the United Nations committee controlling the Straits passage. US Secretary of State Byrnes declared that Soviet ships could pass through the Straits without restriction, but opposed obtaining a base in the Straits. An editorial in the Soviet newspaper Pravda stated that the Soviet Union's move was to protect the interests of the Black Sea countries, and non-Black Sea countries should stop interfering in the administration of the Straits. The Soviet Union has the longest coastline in the Black Sea, and of course has the greatest right of self-defense to prohibit the invasion of navies of non-Black Sea countries.</p>

<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3>South African Female Writer</h3>
<p>— Liu Yisi Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>The most famous female writer in South Africa is Schreiner. Ms. Zhang Jinfen of our country has translated her collection of short stories "Dreams." But there is also a female writer, Liu Yisi (Ethelreda Lewis), who has not been introduced to China. She is very famous in countries such as Britain and the United States. The newspaper reported that she died on August 2 in Port Alfred, South Africa.</p>
<p>She was born in 1876 and lived in South Africa all her life. She is famous for a novel "Trader Horn." Horn's real name is Alfred A. Smith. Liu Yisi's ancestral home is Clew County in England. She was originally a physical education teacher and married a South African civil servant. After giving birth to her first child, she wrote poetry.</p>
<p>She is not a realist, but belongs to the imaginative and poetic side. When her novel "The Harp" (1925) was published, she was already a middle-aged woman, and her son had grown up. "The Harp" can be said to be a poet's novel, loosely structured and emotionally intense. This book discusses racial issues, but it is the poet's idealism, not realism. The scenery of South Africa is written with lively and lovely imagination, and the cold cities in the north, such as the coast of New York and Scandinavia, are used to contrast with the hot South Africa.</p>
<p>After "The Harp," Liu Yisi wrote two more romances: "The Flying Emerald" (1925) and "Mantis" (1926). She called those two books potboilers, which indeed greatly disappointed the admirers of "The Harp."</p>
<p>When she was writing newspaper literature and short stories for South African newspapers, she met the vagrants Horn (Alfred Aloysius Horn) and Jack (Zambesi Jack) trekking to the small garden in Johannesburg to sell household ironware. Jack talked about the stories he knew. Liu Yisi took out her notebook and wrote them down, and wrote books such as "The Ivory Coast in the Earlies" and "The Waters of Africa." These books sold very well on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>She also wrote the famous "An Old Visitor, or The Life and Works of Aloysius Horn" (1927) based on Horn's words. The American edition was retitled "Trader Horn." In 1930, MGM produced a film called "Trader Horn."</p>
<p>She also wrote "The Young Vikings" (1928). Her novels are characterized by the exotic atmosphere of the wilderness.</p>
<h3>Emptiness (Novel)</h3>
<p>— Zhong Yuan</p>
<p>The rain lessened a bit, but the wind was still blowing. The howling wind struck the windows, which rattled incessantly, grating on his nerves.</p>
<p>He himself found it strange. Why had he become so afraid of the wind lately? Perhaps it was old age, fearing the wind would damage his health. That would be a joke, he was still a robust 27-year-old; how could he be called old? Or was it the flimsiness of the house, fearing it would be blown down and crush him? That was even more laughable. He lived in the newly built faculty dormitory of the school. How could it collapse? Even if it did, he was certainly not a base fellow who valued money and feared death! So, was it perhaps sentimentality, the sight of the wind stirring up memories or sadness? This might be somewhat true, though he himself was unwilling to admit it.</p>
<p>He often told his students, "You must strive to pursue knowledge in reality. Reality! Only reality is valuable, great!" Indeed, he was an absolute pragmatist. He denied all ethereal fantasies, and he scorned empty inspirations and such things. When he was a student, he most loathed those classmates who sat by the rose-tinted windows reciting poems. As a teacher, he most hated the few literature teachers who considered themselves elegant, sighed and lamented, and drowned their sorrows in wine. "Literature is the most hypocritical, the most impractical!" He not only thought so, but sometimes even felt that science carried a touch of vagueness, because science was too profound, almost conjuring something from nothing, somewhat elusive. Of course, this was partly due to his natural inclination, but mainly it was his own choice. He chose history and geography. For years, he had poured all his energy into this most practical of subjects. He was constantly pursuing and investigating in reality, just as he encouraged his students.</p>
<p>Yet recently, he had encountered such a thing?</p>
<p>He had taught here for two semesters, and he was familiar with all the male and female colleagues. He was practical, and those he knew were also inclined toward practicality. If someone asked him what kind of person Principal Li was, he would immediately flash his eyes and answer, "Old Li? A pointed face, small eyes, yellowish skin, a slightly hoarse voice, always holding his five-year-old motherless daughter in his arms." Of course, his familiarity with Principal Li was not limited to these appearances; however, he disliked using invisible, intangible, impractical words to describe Old Li or anyone else. Similarly, he knew that Shen Changzi, the physical education teacher, had a striking telephone pole figure, and Miss Zha, who taught kindergarten, had two intensely red cheeks; Old Zhou, the music teacher, always had hair hanging over his forehead, and his mustache grew half an inch every day... In short, almost every colleague left him with a practical, concrete impression, as real and concrete as the photo of the first emperor of Austria that he saw in a world history book.</p>
<p>Only, one female colleague seemed to be a slight exception:</p>
<p>Naturally, he knew her name, a beautiful and practical name – Mei Ye. He was as familiar with her as with the other colleagues: an average build, slightly plump, a long face, small eyes, but not unpleasantly so, her hair was permed, with curls hanging on her forehead, her chest was very developed, and she always looked down when she walked, as if admiring her two prominent, slightly trembling breasts...</p>
<p>"Is she lovely?" A young male colleague had lightly asked him when he first saw her.</p>
<p>"Bah, no interest!" He turned his head away.</p>
<p>"Pah! Don't be a hypocrite! Don't tell me you'll never marry a woman?"</p>
<p>He smiled faintly, not answering, and walked away. How could he answer? He studied history and geography, and he had read about the failures of countless ancient heroes and great men, failures due to one thing—women! The loss of countless beautiful rivers and mountains, lost due to one thing—women—women are terrible, women have been a source of calamity since ancient times, he knew it deeply and guarded against it deeply. But that didn't mean he never wanted to marry a woman, it meant that he was unwilling to build many beautiful romance castles in the air like others, only to end up with nothing. He planned to wait another year or two, find a most suitable girl, and immediately marry her to be his wife, to manage the household, to bear sons and daughters, practically and honestly, never building castles in the sky. When he met a new female colleague, he would, at most, nod to her plainly when he saw her, and that was it. Mei Ye was no exception.</p>
<p>But there was one warm afternoon, the sunlight shone on the playground, hot and dry, baking the yellow sand on the ground until it became parched, and flew up with the wind, flying in the air, like a cloud of yellow smoke, drifting slowly... He lowered his head and walked quickly across this playground, carrying a very thick book under his arm (of course, a book on history and geography), his mind occupied with a question (of course, a question on history and geography). Therefore, he did not notice anyone walking towards him, nor did he notice a string of crisp laughter ringing out in front of him.</p>
<p>"Mr. Yu! Mr. Yu!"</p>
<p>Finally, he was awakened by a clear, laughing call. Looking up, he saw two female colleagues standing in front of him, one was Lu Peihua, the fifth-grade homeroom teacher, and the other was Mei Ye. He had heard people say that they were good friends.</p>
<p>"Uh... Miss Lu, Miss Mei..."</p>
<p>Nodding lightly, greeting them, he prepared to finish and leave as usual. But the two female colleagues stood in front of him, not moving, but looking at him with smiles, as if they had something to say.</p>
<p>"Mr. Yu, don't you recognize us? We recognize you, you were classmates with both of us!" Sure enough, Lu Peihua spoke.</p>
<p>He was stunned, "Oh, I forgot. Where were we classmates?"</p>
<p>"At the Third Middle School. We were freshmen then, and you were an older student. You've forgotten, but we remember it well. It seems you were already wearing glasses at that time and often wore a gray Zhongshan suit..." Lu Peihua said here, tilted her head, nudged Mei Ye, and asked with a smile, "Ah Mei, didn't you say you still remember Mr. Yu playing an old man in a New Year's Day party...?"</p>
<p>"..." Mei Ye did not answer, but raised her small eyes and glanced at him, then immediately lowered her head shyly.</p>
<p>They left, and he also left. The so-called "exception" began at this time.</p>
<p>Logically, this "exception" should have belonged to Lu Peihua, because she smiled at him, she spoke to him, and every time she saw him after that, she would talk to him endlessly. But no! Lu Peihua gave him a very plain, ordinary impression, no different from the impressions he had of other male and female colleagues. Only Mei Ye, although she didn't talk to him much, didn't smile at him, and only gave him a quick glance every time she saw him before lowering her head, but that "glance" was really too unusual, too different! He inexplicably felt that the impression that glance left him with was somewhat beyond reality, somewhat wonderful, and there was an indescribable flavor within it...</p>
<p>He had studied the history of various countries, both Chinese and foreign, but history lacked romantic stories, so he never dreamed that even more "exceptional" things would happen to him within the "exception". One day, Lu Peihua came to his office alone to find him, and said to him softly:</p>
<p>"Mr. Yu, Mei Ye loves you, she wants to be friends with you!"</p>
<p>"Don't joke, Miss Lu!" He laughed.</p>
<p>"Who's joking with you? Really! She asked me to tell you, asking: are you willing or not?"</p>
<p>Looking at Lu Peihua's serious face, he was no longer surprised, nor dared he laugh any more. He remembered that this was the new world of the twentieth century, and everything in the new world, of course, could not be compared with the situations in history. That's right, men and women are equal, men can court women, why can't women court men? Everything like "female dignity" and "virgin sanctity" should be broken and abolished!</p>
<p>Since this "exception" within an "exception" occurred, he had saved some time from studying history and geography to consider this question: He was practical, of course, his consideration was definitely not limited to an empty word "love". He had thought carefully: in terms of age, he could indeed start a family. However, he knew that he was not rich, and the wife he married must not be fond of vanity, be gentle and able to endure hardship, in order to have a happy and fulfilling family. Now that Mei Ye was interested, then he might as well befriend her first, observe her as well.</p>
<p>In the spring evening, although the school campus was small, it also had patches of tender green grass, blooming with a few red, white, and yellow small flowers. The sun had already set, and sparrows chirped on the ridge of the neighbor's house. Mei Ye and Lu Peihua walked side by side in front, he quietly followed behind, coming out of the faculty office, stepping onto the cement corridor next to the campus. There was no one around. Lu Peihua deliberately quickened her pace and hurried away first, leaving him and Mei Ye alone in the garden.</p>
<p>Night was gradually falling, the first small star of dusk appeared on the horizon, and the light from the street lamps outside also shone in. He stood quietly under a wintersweet tree, gazing at her: In the dim starlight and lamplight, her blood-red lips, curly hair, and prominent breasts seemed even more beautiful, mysterious, and alluring... He finally forgot the question he had considered again and again, forgot the purpose of befriending Mei Ye, he succumbed to some empty realities before him: watery eyes, red lips, slightly trembling breasts. He was as drunk as if he had drunk wine, he was dazed!...</p>
<p>It seemed that she was the first to notice someone coming from behind, and said to him, "Someone's coming, let's go, we'll talk again tomorrow."</p>
<p>He didn't answer, just stared at her in fascination, reluctantly seeing her to the school gate, gazing at her back disappearing into the thin night mist, and kept saying to himself: "She is lovely, I must have her! I must have her!"</p>
<p>The new world of the twentieth century had invented wireless telegraphy, and people's ears were as sharp as radios, the news quickly spread throughout the school, and everyone knew Lu Peihua's nickname, "Matchmaker".</p>
<p>"Hey, Old Yu, slow down, 'Matchmaker' has brought you a letter again!"</p>
<p>"Old Yu, why haven't you treated us to honey cakes yet? Quickly come with a special express train!"</p>
<p>The teasing and jokes of colleagues became almost commonplace. At first, he couldn't help but feel a little annoyed, but gradually, not only was he not annoyed, but he felt supreme joy, supreme glory. Every time people teased him, he would open his mouth and smile slightly – a smile from the bottom of his heart!</p>
<p>He admitted that he was completely subdued by her. He couldn't leave her for a moment, it would be good even to see her shadow reflected on the ground, he had no heart to consider anything else, as if it were a world-shaking event: the overall situation was settled? Just then, a natural science teacher in the school asked for a long vacation, and Principal Li asked each teacher if they could recommend a suitable substitute teacher. When he asked him, he suddenly remembered that a classmate had recently asked him to find a job. He thought of recommending that classmate to Principal Li.</p>
<p>The morning he introduced the substitute teacher Niu Changqing to every colleague, white clouds moved gently in the sky, and the sunlight shone softly from a row of long glass windows into the office, illuminating Niu Changqing's tall and imposing figure, his well-tailored suit, and his pair of lively and passionate big eyes.</p>
<p>He never thought that he, standing in front of Niu Changqing, suddenly seemed very old and dull, and he never thought that a woman's emotions could be more fragile and weak than willow branches in a strong wind. He introduced the other colleagues in his usual tone, walked to Mei Ye's side, and unusually smiled at Niu Changqing: "This Miss Mei Ye, you already know... no need to introduce her, right?..."</p>
<p>Mei Ye and Niu Changqing smiled at each other, he thought it was his unusual smile that infected people, so he didn't pay much attention. By the time he began to pay attention, things had progressed to an alarming extent.</p>
<p>In retrospect, perhaps one could laugh it off calmly! But at the time, it was indeed somewhat unbearable. He stared blankly at Lu Peihua's pointed oval face, without moving for two minutes! Not smiling, not even breathing, finally he opened his trembling lips with difficulty and asked:</p>
<p>"Is there no room for recovery?"</p>
<p>"I think there's no way to recover!" Lu Peihua looked at him coldly, with a hint of pity: "Since she told you to give up, then just give up! Anyway, in the beginning, you were just passive!"</p>
<p>Hearing this, he seemed to wake up from a confused dream. "Passive", that's right, she pursued him first, asked him for love first: now, seeing Niu Changqing, she threw him away again. Heh, this shameless woman! Vile woman! No interest, then break up!</p>
<p>He didn't look at Lu Peihua again (even seeing her made him disgusted), and straightened up and walked outside. That day was Sunday, the house was quiet, and it was also quiet outside. The bleak yellow sun hung in the gray sky, as if it was about to rain heavily. He turned a corner in the outside corridor, walked into the quiet library, and sat down in front of several tall bookshelves inside.</p>
<p>Holding up a thick, hard "Encyclopedia of History and Geography," he returned to his original self—a pursuer of knowledge and reality!</p>
<p>He read one word after another, writing one word after another carefully in his notebook; everything around was quiet, and his heart was also quiet. However, suddenly a shrill voice pierced his ears like a thorn, it was the coquettish laughter that Mei Ye often made.</p>
<p>"Well, let's go over there, it's better over there!"</p>
<p>"It's not reliable over there! Maybe that bookworm is in the library, what if he sees us?" It was Niu Changqing's suppressed voice.</p>
<p>"Bah! I'm not afraid even if he sees us, I insist on doing it for him to see, what can he do to us?"</p>
<p>He suspected that it had already rained outside, and the sky had suddenly darkened, and for a moment the words on the book became blurry. He desperately widened his eyes to continue writing down some outlines, but suddenly he realized that what he had written in his notebook were many words like "shameless," "woman," "calamity," and other messy words.</p>
<p>He seemed unable to sit down any longer, he threw down the pen in his hand and ran out of the library. It turned out that it was not raining outside, but a gust of howling wind was madly sweeping in the air. When he ran through the small campus with his eyes closed, Mei Ye's sharp laughter came again in the wind: "Hee hee hee! I insist on doing it for that bookworm to see in the future, what can he do?"</p>
<p>Just so, this thing happened two months ago, he was practical, he ended that thing with a calm "smile", forgetting that thing, but somehow from that time on, he suddenly became afraid of the wind.</p>
<p>Now the rain has stopped, but the wind is still blowing. The howling wind struck the windows, which rattled incessantly. He sat in the room, thinking gloomily, he didn't admit that the wind stirred up his memories, his sadness. But he was irritable, he couldn't read, he had no way to escape a kind of inexplicable annoyance...</p>
<p>Gradually he heard a burst of laughter downstairs, he knew it was several male colleagues chatting in the downstairs office, so he listlessly pulled up a piece of paper and wrote a line on it:</p>
<p>"The wind is so strong, I'm extremely irritable, who can use a few words to relieve my irritability, I will give a box of unopened 'Hardman' cigarettes as a gift!"</p>
<p>He called a tea boy to send the note downstairs. After a while, the tea boy returned with a smile, with three other notes in his hand. He took the notes and read them one by one.</p>
<p>"Form is emptiness, emptiness is form," was the handwriting of an old colleague who studied Buddhist scriptures.</p>
<p>"The Preacher says: vanity of vanities, vanity of vanities, all is vanity!" was written by a young colleague who believed in Christianity.</p>
<p>He shook his head, threw the two notes he had read into the wastebasket with force. When he unfolded the third large note, there were a few lines of neat ink characters on it. At a glance, he recognized it as the handwriting of Wang Yiping, the literature teacher he usually disliked the most.</p>
<p>"Friend! Are you afraid of the wind? But the wind is ethereal. You hear its voice, but you don't know where it comes from? Where it goes? You hate it, but you can never grasp it, you can never eliminate it! Good! This is like the various troubles of moldy life – invisible, unspeakable, never able to grasp, never able to eliminate!…</p>
<p>Friend! Do you hope to relieve some烦恼嗎？ I advise you to have a glass of liquor with me, sing a few lines of 'The Great River Flows Eastward:’…</p>
<p>Seeing this, he couldn't help but smile slightly, grabbed a box of "Hardman" on the table and handed it to the tea boy and said:</p>
<p>"Take it down to Mr. Wang, tell him I'll be there in a while!"</p>
<h3>An Inch of Territory, An Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng 16</p>
<p>Climbing into the carriage, he pulled out a business card and handed it over:</p>
<p>"Now that you, the Special Commissioner, have returned to headquarters, please don't forget me. If I can be promoted in the future, I will definitely be grateful for your kindness."</p>
<p>After all this fuss, I finally understood what he was up to.</p>
<p>The car sped along quite quickly, though it also rattled intensely. Each time we passed a sentry post, thanks to this fellow, who explained his rank and identity, plus "urgent official business," we were allowed through.</p>
<p>Who knew that in less than thirty minutes, the two armies would formally engage each other, first with sparse rifle and light machine-gun fire, and then the artillery in the sky joined in. Although we weren't within the firing line, we weren't too far away either. Several times the car was stopped by sentries, but this fellow, invoking the name of my headquarters' business, forced our way forward, sometimes moving parallel to the firing line, sometimes at an angle.</p>
<p>"As long as we can move, that's good," I thought to myself.</p>
<p>Who knew that the further the car went, the denser the shooting became. Finally, we encountered many wounded-soldier trucks, and we were definitively blocked, absolutely forbidden from going any further. At this point, "Pig Teeth" used all his powers of persuasion, pleading, begging for mercy, threatening, and intimidating, but to no avail. From the patrol squad, we learned that we were only two or three kilometers from the racetrack, and that almost the entire line was open fire; or rather, several fronts were engaged.</p>
<p>Just as we were hesitating, a battlefield military police patrol team arrived. Artillery fire was flying overhead.</p>
<p>"You must immediately retreat to your original defense, or transfer to Fengtai!" The military police seemed to be ordering; "The lights inside and on the front of the car must not be turned off, to avoid accidents!"</p>
<p>"Let's retreat!" "Pig Teeth" sought my opinion, and I agreed.</p>
<p>The car turned around, and after less than a mile, I remembered it was the quietest place along the road, with a bit of sparse woods and earthen hills. I felt that even if we had no special mission, retreating was impossible; because the advance and retreat of the battlefield are constantly changing, and no one can predict what will happen in the next minute. So I ordered Pig Teeth in a commanding tone:</p>
<p>"Stop the car!"</p>
<p>This time, he was sitting next to the driver. We could see each other clearly under the overhead light.</p>
<p>The car stopped, but just at that moment, when the driver and that wine-sodden fellow were about to ask me the reason for stopping, they saw that my hand was on the pistol holster, and the way I was signaling to Little Tiger. Actually, this was superfluous. The moment I ordered the car to stop, Little Tiger had already understood everything.</p>
<p>The two fellows got out of the car at the same time, suspecting something. Under these special circumstances, friend and foe were just a matter of a glance. The two fellows were already on guard, but they still didn't dare to act recklessly.</p>
<p>"What are the Special Commissioner's orders?" Pig Teeth approached the car door and asked. I saw his two hateful gold teeth.</p>
<p>"We must get to the city quickly today, but the situation is so bad that we have to take risks," I expressed my determination.</p>
<h3>Heroic and Exquisite</h3>
<p>— Gao Tianxin</p>
<p>Large seals (over one inch) should be engraved with a heroic spirit to have grandeur; small seals (two fen) must be exquisite to be intriguing. If a large seal is engraved without grandeur, it cannot be eye-catching and lacks spirit. If a small seal is not engraved with precision, it feels crude and tasteless. Using broad strokes to engrave a small seal is ultimately not as beautiful as carving it carefully with a small knife. Conversely, using a small knife to carve a large seal is also a major taboo. These two wonderful realms (engraving large seals and engraving small seals) are not easy tasks. Only those with similar temperaments can do it.</p>
<p>Objectively speaking, large seals can fully express the artistic interest of seal engraving, and can fully demonstrate the beauty of knife technique, brush technique, composition, and seal script. It is clear at a glance. Crystal clear on paper, it is especially pleasing to the eye and heart. Small seals, due to their small size, in addition to feeling delicate and exquisite, actually have a sense of the hero having no place to display his skills in terms of knife technique, brush technique, composition, and seal script.</p>
<h3>"To the Fields"</h3>
<p>— Work by Jean-François Millet (1814-1875)</p>
<p>Stored in the Glasgow Art Gallery</p>
<p>Millet was born into a farming family and was poor from childhood. Between the ages of fourteen and eighteen, he worked in the fields, but he was born with a talent for painting. When he had time, he often picked up charcoal to draw on the walls. The villagers saw it and were amazed, so they raised money to send him to Paris to study painting. At first, he was not very famous, but after the age of thirty-five, he gradually began to show his talent. Millet's paintings mostly depict the lives of farmers, the simple and rustic scenes of the countryside, and each picture is filled with a kind of warm humanity.</p>

<h3>Military Vehicles</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Please note from the military organs stationed in Shanghai:</p>
<p>Shanghai has many traffic accidents caused by military vehicles. In the statistical figures, perhaps the number accounted for by military vehicles is not very large, but due to military vehicles driving too fast due to mission requirements, or due to the special form of the vehicle body, or due to the unusual circumstances of the accident, military vehicles have become the biggest target in traffic accidents, for the military organs orders that special management should be given.</p>
<p>We know that there are many things that the person in charge does not understand beforehand, and even does not know after the fact.</p>
<p>Traffic order in the city needs the assistance of all parties to maintain and abide by. Public life should not have special classes that can be exempted. Here, we request that the US military authorities stationed in Shanghai can work with us to ensure that the driving skills and life management of drivers must be strict, and that the traffic regulations promulgated by the municipal authorities must be checked and strictly followed.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a city, not a war zone. On country roads, one can speed and rush around, but on roads in the city where pedestrians crowd, it is simply intentional murder!</p>
<h3>I'm Selling – National Loan Substitute Coupons</h3>
<p>— By Zheng</p>
<p>A Female Student's Report</p>
<p>This time, to promote the National Loan Substitute Coupons, our high school division formed a group of five girls, with a quota of one million. Because my health isn't great, I usually prefer quiet and don't like being active, and I don't have the gift of gab, so my four classmates were kind enough to assign me only 100,000 yuan worth of coupons. But receiving these 100,000 yuan in coupons already weighed heavily on my mind.</p>
<p>Back home, I immediately discussed it with my father. My father said, "Tomorrow, I'll introduce you to some old friends. It'll be easier to sell them that way."</p>
<p>Just then, a Mr. Mao, who is the chief accountant at the ×× Electric Company, happened to be there. He volunteered, "You can come to our company tomorrow. You can sell at least 20,000 yuan."</p>
<p>My father said, "That's wonderful. First go to Mr. Mao's, then pass by ××× Road going east to Mr. Yang's place at the ×× Insurance Company on ×× Road. He's a young tycoon and an old friend of mine. You can sell at least 50,000 yuan there."</p>
<p>That was the conversation the evening before yesterday. Yesterday morning, although the weather was very hot and I wasn't feeling well, I walked from Haining Road to Mr. Mao's place on ××× Road. Mr. Mao was very polite. He picked out two 2,000 yuan coupons from my hand and gave me 4,000 yuan. I said, "Didn't you promise me 20,000 yuan yesterday?"</p>
<p>He said, "Take it easy. So many people are donating these days. If I gave you more, it would be embarrassing for me."</p>
<p>He was just an accountant; he couldn't be generous with public funds. I naturally didn't press him to fulfill his promise from the day before.</p>
<p>Walking east to Mr. Yang's place, I explained my purpose, but unexpectedly, his expression changed drastically. He said, "Why are you coming to me with this kind of thing?"</p>
<p>I said, "If I don't try to sell to people I know, it'll be even harder to sell to people I don't know!"</p>
<p>He reluctantly gave me 5,000 yuan, looking as if he was suffering from some terrible illness. I didn't say anything and gave him the 5,000 yuan worth of coupons. He looked at them, then tried to return them to me. I said, "Don't be polite. Goodbye!"</p>
<p>Back home, it was already 12:30 PM. I was angry, exhausted, and hot, but I didn't feel hungry.</p>
<p>In the evening, Mrs. Wei, our neighbor, came over for a chat. She said, "These past few days, I've bought a lot of stuff: glass wallets, glass shoes... etc."</p>
<p>I thought this was a good opportunity and immediately said, "Those are foreign goods. Would you mind buying some domestic goods as well?"</p>
<p>"Sure," she readily replied, "I lent out 2 million yuan last month at a two-cent interest rate, and I just received 500,000 yuan in interest yesterday."</p>
<p>So I explained the significance of promoting National Loan Substitute Coupons to her. She said, "Okay, I'll buy 50,000 yuan worth."</p>
<p>I was extremely happy. I thought that in this way, the gap would be narrowed. As she was leaving, I quickly placed the 50,000 yuan worth of coupons in her hand.</p>
<p>She said, "I'll send the 50,000 yuan over tomorrow morning." I said, "No need. I'll come to pick it up at nine o'clock tomorrow morning because I have to submit the payment in the afternoon." My mother quietly said to me, "Don't be too optimistic. People call that woman 'Thirteen O'Clock'!"</p>
<p>This morning, I went to her residence. She said, "Come back this afternoon. I'll have it ready for you after lunch." As she spoke, she was counting money, at least several hundred thousand yuan.</p>
<p>After lunch, I went back, and she suddenly said, "Doesn't this coupon only become valid on September 1st?"</p>
<p>"This won't work," she said, "then I'll lose four or five days of interest. It's not worth it."</p>
<p>I said, "That's not how it works. Didn't I explain the meaning of issuing National Loan Substitute Coupons to you?"</p>
<p>"I forgot. Then come back on the evening of August 31st to pick it up?"</p>
<p>"That's too late," I said impatiently.</p>
<p>"If it's too late, then take the coupons back. I don't think you'll be able to buy any outstanding domestic goods with them anyway." I picked up the coupons and returned home, almost crying.</p>
<h3>My New Clothes</h3>
<p>— By Old Pu</p>
<p>Because prices keep rising, while salary increases crawl like snails, for years I've been spending more than I earn each month, and my finances are incredibly strained. Just getting enough to eat is a problem, so buying clothes is out of the question, which means my clothes are gradually becoming tattered. My wife, seeing my plight, can't help but feel sad, and she often urges me to make some new clothes. I know I can't put it off any longer, but where am I going to get the money for clothes?</p>
<p>Thankfully, there's always a way out. The higher-ups saw fit to add 40 yuan to my base salary, so now my monthly income can increase by 15,000 yuan. Isn't this a good opportunity to make some new clothes? I told my wife this good news, and she was very happy too.</p>
<p>Even though it wasn't even mid-month yet, I couldn't wait for the end of the month to get the money and make some new clothes. I finally managed to wait it out, and the end of the month finally arrived. When I went to the accounting office to collect my salary, even though it was just an increase of 15,000 yuan, my heart was filled with hope and happiness.</p>
<p>After collecting my salary, it was only 5 PM, so I decided to buy the fabric first and then go home.</p>
<p>Inside the fabric store, the silk fabrics in the glass cabinets were displayed in a dazzling array, and whole bolts of coarse cloth were piled in the corner, as tall as a person. Customers flowed in and out, and the shop assistants ran back and forth like shuttles. One shop assistant came up to me.</p>
<p>"Sir, what kind of material are you looking for?"</p>
<p>"Do you have uniform fabric?"</p>
<p>"Yes, we do."</p>
<p>He immediately brought over several bolts of fabric:</p>
<p>"Sir, this is flannel, most suitable for making uniforms, the price will be satisfactory to you; that kind is American wool, the color is very bright and generous."</p>
<p>"How much does this flannel cost?"</p>
<p>"5,000 yuan a yard, very cheap, *hee hee*, the American wool is only 7,000 yuan a yard, it will look even better on a gentleman like you in American wool."</p>
<p>I couldn't help but be stunned. 7,000, 5,000, I can't even make a pair of pants, let alone a uniform? The shop assistant saw that I was dazed and already understood most of it:</p>
<p>"There is also a blue khaki only at, black wool three thousand five to four thousand, the color is also very generous."</p>
<p>"Then how much does An'an Blue sell for?"</p>
<p>"Only sells for 3,000, the cheapest and most generous."</p>
<p>The cheapest, 3,000 yuan a yard, a set of uniform needs at least six yards, which is 18,000 yuan, plus 8,000 yuan for labor, oh my god! 26,000 yuan is such a huge amount! I can only sigh at the fabric.</p>
<p>I brazenly walked out of the first fabric store, but within a few minutes, I walked out of the fourth fabric store, my hands still empty. What to do? Poor civil servants are ultimately not destined to wear new clothes.</p>
<p>I staggered down the street, my heart filled with disappointment and sadness. The beautiful goods in the department store seemed to be mocking me, and the colorful silks in the fabric store were also flaunting their wealth. Why have I become so miserable after eight years?</p>
<p>Suddenly, a strong neon light shone over, and I looked up sharply. The four big characters "×× Thrift Shop" immediately caught my eye.</p>
<p>That's right, since I can't afford new clothes, buying a set of used ones is also good.</p>
<p>Stepping into the thrift shop, there were indeed quite a few uniforms hanging on the wall, but the prices were only 10-20% cheaper than new ones. Finally, in the corner, I saw a set of eight-year-old woolen uniforms, priced at 17,000.</p>
<p>After a long period of negotiation, spending a lot of saliva, I finally bought it for 15,000 yuan.</p>
<p>So, after not wearing a set of new clothes for many years, I finally have a set of new clothes today.</p>
<h3>Such an Examination</h3>
<p>— By Dingjiang</p>
<p>The second examination of ×× University was held today; I was assigned to Xu Hui Middle School to supervise the afternoon civics exam. The questions were indeed a bit difficult. However, our ×× North classmates, taking the lead, withdrew from the examination hall in large numbers. I think such heroic and promising students' attitudes of walking away with their heads held high are indeed admirable. However, when I ventured out, I saw these people holding books, copying furiously. After copying, they went back in to submit their papers, even messing with the proctors. The proctors just let them go. This strange phenomenon struck a heavy blow to my perception of students' pure and flawless hearts.</p>
<p>Many of the current scum and traitors were the most enthusiastic participants in the May Fourth Movement. However, the molding of a deteriorating society turned them into shameless corrupt officials. Now that I think about it, if these so-called university students are already so despicable in their student days, then what will they be like if they ever hold political power?</p>
<p>I don't want to think about it, and I can't bear to think about it. In this period of national reconstruction where education is paramount, this strange situation just makes me feel heartbroken to speak of and brings tears to my eyes to think of!</p>

<h3>Students as Waiters</h3>
<p>— By Zhongqi</p>
<p>Life Notes</p>
<p>I am a student.</p>
<p>I can't let the two months of summer vacation go to waste. Moreover, a student should be able to earn his own tuition, so as to avoid my aging father having to run around in the sweltering heat to arrange tuition for us children. That's practically treating my father like a beast of burden. How can we children live with that?</p>
<p>Therefore, this summer vacation, I went to work at a candy and soda shop. Although this position is the despised "Boy", and the salary is pitifully low, that's precisely why it's enough for me to understand what the lives of servants are like. At the same time, at least three meals a day can be solved, which can slightly reduce my father's burden.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it's not unprecedented for students to act as waiters. I remember a few years ago, the International Hotel publicly advertised for university students to work as waiters. At the time, the newspapers also engaged in a heated debate. Some people thought that such places were excessively luxurious and extravagant, a hotbed of vice, and not a place where pure and simple students should find themselves. Others thought that working part-time and studying was sacred labor, so why not let students who have never stepped into society enrich their life experience?</p>
<p>But now I believe that the phrase "labor is sacred" is ultimately an ideal, and the reality is not so. If you don't believe me, look at what kind of labor is considered sacred today? Generally speaking, our kind of work that exchanges labor for life is still considered lowly by most people. Often, many customers think very highly of themselves and put on airs of young masters or mistresses, wanting us to come at their beck and call, or complaining that we don't serve them well enough. For example, when a customer drinks soda, we give him a glass, but he insists on having a straw; if we give him a straw, he insists on having a glass. If we give him both, then the boss orders that we don't, isn't that making things difficult for us? At this time, we can only nod and say "yes, yes!" That's when they feel victorious. Regarding this arrogant attitude, we often have some rebellious emotions. However, in order to maintain commercial ethics, even if some things go against our wishes, we have to swallow our anger and not dwell on it.</p>
<p>But then again, good customers are not unheard of. They are very considerate of the difficulties of doing business and understand our plight. Of course, the ideal of "labor is sacred" will once again ripple in our minds, making us feel that the saying "practice is the mother of theory" is correct, and even if we are physically tired, we are temporarily filled with satisfaction.</p>
<p>Indeed, our work is quite busy and laborious. Starting at seven in the morning and continuing until twelve late at night, except for meal times, we work for almost ten hours without any rest. Although there are few cold drinks in the morning, the bread and sugar sauce business is extremely busy. After noon, the cold drinks come one after another. Until after closing, we still have to do a round of cleaning and tidying: washing tea sets, boiling face towels, wiping display windows, mopping floors, all such work falls on our shoulders. We can't fall asleep until almost one o'clock every day, so we only get five or six hours of rest a day. How can we still have the energy to deal with customers and do such heavy work during the day? Running back and forth all day long has already made our legs ache. As soon as we lie down on the bed, we truly "don't know when the east turns white!" This is our day's life.</p>
<p>It's also pitiful to say that for work like ours, we should get decent pay. But now our biggest income—tips—has become a problem. The reason is that sales tax needs to be added by another 20%, which increases costs invisibly, and the income from tips is naturally greatly affected.</p>
<p>After working as a waiter for just ten days, I casually looked in the mirror and found that I had lost a lot of weight. I remember when I was a child, I read Liu Banchen's "Apprentice's Misery," which described the life of an apprentice who was "born of my parents." How much different is it from our lives as waiters?</p>
<h3>Female Regimental Commander Escapes the Fiery Pit, Willing to Be a Servant</h3>
<p>— By Youfu</p>
<p>Because it's difficult to find good servants in Shanghai, I asked a friend to find me a servant from Jiangbei. Coincidentally, the servant of the neighbor downstairs is an old woman who is almost 70 or 80 years old. She has a daughter-in-law who just escaped from northern Jiangsu to Shanghai and is looking for a place to stay. Therefore, I hired her daughter-in-law. She is a young woman of about twenty years old, with the beauty of a country girl, her body is sturdy and strong. She works quickly and diligently, and I am very satisfied.</p>
<p>But after half a month, she didn't seem to be as good as she was when she first came, not as conscientious in her work. She seemed to have the air of a soldier, the demeanor of an officer, and her attitude was gradually growing. Everything seemed very reluctant.</p>
<p>Recently, she has changed even more drastically, doing things nonsensically, ignoring me. I thought she didn't want to continue working, or that she thought the work was too hard or the pay was too little! So, I asked my wife to ask her what was wrong, why she wasn't happy and why she was so depressed? Her answer was: "My matter, Madam, cannot be resolved for me, so it's not convenient to say."</p>
<p>My wife thought it was even stranger, and her curiosity drove her to pay extra attention, still unwilling to give up, and insisted on getting an answer. After repeated questioning, I finally obtained a shocking, painful, tortuous, and bizarre piece of news:</p>
<p>She was originally not a servant, but a female regimental commander. After the Communist army entered Taixing, northern Jiangsu, she was forcibly conscripted for training. Because she was young and beautiful, and physically strong, it is said that there were many people pursuing her. Because of these many factors, she was also forced to preside over "Women's Training" and was honorably appointed to the position of "Regimental Commander." Every day, she had to lead five or six hundred female soldiers in drills. But even so, she spent the whole day washing her face with tears, living a very painful life. Their various despicable behaviors followed the slogans of democracy and liberation. Oppressed, she couldn't breathe. She couldn't survive any longer, she was in extreme pain, so she finally took a short leave of absence to Shanghai on the pretext of looking for her husband (and had a guarantor), escaped the liberated area, and escaped the sea of suffering.</p>
<p>But fate had destined her, and the god of misfortune still surrounded her. Now, her guarantor has been ordered to come to Shanghai to find her and take her back. If she doesn't go back, her land will be confiscated, her house burned down, her family property confiscated, and her guarantor shot. Therefore, she is in extreme anxiety.</p>
<p>However, she has already held an emergency family meeting with her family in Shanghai and decided not to go back. Because even if she goes back, things will be bad, and it will be even worse if she returns. According to the guarantor, "The Communist army believes that she is gone forever, that she is deceiving the higher-ups and surrendering to the old central government, and that she is a traitor." As a result, even the "guarantor" who came to Shanghai to find her (the guarantor when she asked for leave) did not go back. They cannot go back, and their family property in their hometown can only be left to fate!</p>
<p>She is willing to be a servant; she really can't do the "regimental commander" anymore.</p>

<h3>Litvinov, Who Stepped Down</h3>
<p>— By Qian Fanfu</p>
<p>The Advocate of "Collective Security"</p>
<p>According to a Reuter dispatch from London on the 24th: Soviet "Vice Minister" Litvinov has been dismissed. This diplomat, who was once world-renowned, has thus announced his departure from the world political stage. Litvinov reached the age of seventy a month ago. Counting from when he was appointed as the Soviet Plenipotentiary Representative to the United Kingdom in 1917 to his recent dismissal, his career as a diplomat has lasted exactly thirty years. From the success of the Soviet revolution to its rise to the status of a strong power, Litvinov is well aware of the causes and consequences in between.</p>
<p>Mr. Litvinov was born in 1876. His father was a Jew named Belostrotsky, whose family was well-off. He was sent to a commercial school from an early age. After graduating at the age of seventeen, he served in the "Imperial Russian" army, but he was inspired by the then-popular socialist ideas, so he joined the "Russian Social Democratic Labour Party" in 1898 - the predecessor of the Soviet Communist Party.</p>
<p>After joining the party, he worked hard on revolutionary work. In 1901, he was arrested by the royal secret service, sentenced to six years of imprisonment, and exiled to Siberia. After spending a year and a half in a dark prison, he and eleven comrades escaped from prison and arrived in Switzerland, where he met Lenin. He lived a life of wandering overseas with them. In 1903, the party was reorganized, and Litvinov officially joined the "Communist Party". In 1905, he sneaked back to China and engaged in secret activities near Volar.</p>
<p>In 1917, the "October Revolution" occurred, and the Soviet government was established. He was appointed as the Plenipotentiary Representative to the United Kingdom. Soon after, he returned to China to serve as "Vice Minister". In 1930, he was promoted to People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs. From 1918 to 1935, Litvinov continuously travelled internationally, while using this as a means of diplomatic negotiation. This period was the golden age of his political life.</p>
<p>In 1927, he represented the Soviet Union at the "Geneva Disarmament Conference" and proposed a bill advocating that all countries completely abolish their military equipment. This greatly amazed the world, and his reputation grew daily. His words and actions were always noticed by the world, and he was given the title of "Envoy of Peace."</p>
<p>During his tenure, Litvinov used his wit and skill to negotiate with the strong capitalist countries, consolidating the Soviet Union's international status. He signed mutual assistance treaties with European and American powers and resolved many international disputes, but he was therefore regarded as a Soviet diplomat who was pro-British and pro-American. Therefore, some people suspect that Litvinov's dismissal this time is nothing less than an extremely complex and serious explanation of international relations, which have reached a critical point.</p>
