<h3>外匯牌價週一公布　貝祖詒任中行總裁　國府昨日明令准俞鴻鈞辭兼職　宋院長搭機由渝來滬</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿六日電〕國防最高委會通過開放外匯市場後，渝市金。鈔市價立見下瀉，本日黃金每兩跌價一萬七八千元，收盤廠條一萬三千五，美鈔一千九百四十元。中央銀行定三月四日（星期一）公布外匯牌價。（中央銀行管理外匯暫行辦法全又刋第四版請參閱）</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿六日電〕國府廿六日令：兼中央銀行總裁兪鴻鈞呈請辭職，兪鴻鈞准免兼職，此令。特任貝祖詒為中央銀行總裁，此令。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿六日電〕此間中外商界人士，對於政府央定之外匯新條例，均表歡迎。某商人稱：此項條例對於穩定中國幣制已收一半功效，一般意見認為：新條例擬在貿易恢復之後，聽任外匯率自動尋覓水準。新條例之目的，第一為防止資金之逃避，第二為制止投機，第三為鼓勵出口。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿六日電〕宋院長廿六日下午二時由渝飛滬。又漢口電，宋院長廿六日晚六時許飛抵本市，因氣候惡劣，在此間降陸，定廿七日晨繼續飛滬。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕國防最高委員會通過開放匯市塲消息透露後，本市黃金外幣證券等之行市，頗受震撼，一般臆測，外匯買賣旣吿開放，對外貿易可望恢復，或能因此而獲得較廉之匯率，惟亦有以新進口貨之分類辦法尙未公布，對政府究將採行何稱程度之申請許可手續，頗呈觀望，以致消息初傳時，一般市况，頗呈游移姿態，惟終吿一致瀉挫，黃金見一百四十六萬之低價，美鈔一度見二三三〇元最低價，其他如中外股市及價市等，無一不挫，足見當局新外匯措置，對上海市塲已發生初步之穩定作用。記者昨走訪財政金特派員辦公處負責人，據吿：當局開放外匯市塲案，僅見報載，彼處尙未接到當局之訓令，惟渠深信，詳細實施辦法，不久即可頒到，當可按照辦理，以遂行中央安定金融，平穩物價之宗旨。又據一般觀察：政府今後對工業及民生需要物品，得不經政府之許可，由人民隨時購辦輸入，此於國內工業之發展及國民生計之前途，裨益匪淺。且政府對外匯之供給與收買，將由中央銀行及指定之若干銀行，察酌市面情形，供求實况，予以適當之調節，則過渡之波動，自可防免。對於外幣鈔票及黃金之買賣，亦將依照同樣原則辦理，並指撥美金五億元，為法幣準備金，今後政府可充份利用其公開市塲之買賣政策，以收平穩金融市塲之宏效，故預料今後之外匯外幣黃金證券等市况，必能逐步納入正軌，物價當日趨平穩，若即若離之對外貿易，即可步入坦途。</p>

<h3>調處部抗議　請願團事件</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕軍事調處部以鄭介民·葉劍英·饒伯森三委員署名之抗議書，廿一日送達北平市政府，對二十日河北難民請願團千餘人，擁進該部呌囂鬥毆，妨碍工作，提出嚴重抗議，要求熊市長採取適當有效辦法，保證執行部內政府中共美方之辦公塲所住宅及工作人員安全自由，以便該部獲有繼續其和平工作之條件。三委員並於抗議書內鄭重聲明，彼等於提出抗議書之際，完全了解與尊重人民一切民衆自由權利，而未有反對或干涉之意。此外三委員並電呈蔣主席請責令有關機關，對該部克盡保護之責。軍調部今明兩日可能就此事發表公報。</p>
<h3>主席今日赴渝郊南京　向政校學生訓話　對蘇談判依條約爲基礎</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶廿六日電〕蔣主席本日午後三時一刻召見文官長與鼎昌，談話內容聞對當前大局有關。又據確息：蔣主席二十七日將至南泉向政校學生訓話，並聽取彼等對國是之意見。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿六日電〕蔣主席昨曾派陳立夫前往中央政治學校，勸阻學生遊行，因該校為國民黨之組織，但學生不聽。據報載：成都燕京大學之校門被搗毀，囚該校學生未參加第一次示威遊行之　，燕京學生星期一絕食一天，對此表示抗議，但組織一愛國團體，支持其他學生對東北問題之見解。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿六日電〕蔣主席向東北行營發出訓令，規定對蘇談判務須以尊重中蘇條約為基礎。而與中國法律相符合，勿與中國所簽訂之其他各項國際協定相矛盾。此乃對於蘇聯及全世界之明確的指示。即中國次不在東九省作種種讓步，以免損及中國之完整。惟一般人以為，中蘇條的之條欵，實際為雅爾達會議三巨頭所決定，中國除接受以外，別無他途，實令人憤慨。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿六日電〕據此間共產黨方面聲稱：成都「新華日報」館已被「蓋世太保」搗毀。上星期日成都學生遊行後，此事即行發生。</p>
<h3>學生繼續遊行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕首都各界爲要求蘇聯撤退東北駐軍，反對東北特殊化；今日在陰霾籠罩細雨霏霏中，舉行空前之救國示威大遊行，參加者包括士農工商各單位臨時大學敎授萬餘人，中尤以在十四年前曾為東北被日本帝國主義侵略而遊行之六十高齡陳傖夫敎授，再度漫步行伍間，最足令人感慨。遊行羣衆尾隨於高奏「義勇軍進行曲」之樂隊，浩蕩前進，一時交通為之阻塞，沿途高呼口號，張貼標語，並分組演講，情緒緊張熱烈，市民佇立觀看，莫不感奮動容，有多處民衆自動高呼口號，以響應遊行羣衆之怒吼。今日之遊行，因警憲常局事前已布置保護，故未發生意外情事。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿六日電〕渝市南岸區學生一萬餘人，為東北問題今日舉行愛國大遊行，至國府時，繞大門一週，卅位代表向蔣主席呈述對國事意見，由文官處文書局局長許靜芝接見並致詞，略謂：蔣主席對於愛國行動極為嘉許，曾於昨日懇切指示，盼諸同學對國事要注重理智，勿增加政府困難及損傷國際友情。政府二十餘年來即爲求中國領土之完勝整而奮鬥中，蘇友誼不僅爲我們所必需，亦爲世界和平之有力保證，於東北問題，主席亦曾指示，在不違背政府法令，尊重中，蘇友好條約及不損害國家主權。領土完整之原則下，謀求解次，盼各同學信任政府。</p>

<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕馬歇爾確擬赴東北一行，時間常在巡視華北各地後，軍調處工作範圍將擴展至東北，工作時間亦將延長因其尙負監督整軍任務也。馬。張·周等可能於廿七·八日來平，三氏出巡地區，已暫定集寗·濟南·張家口·新鄉·太原。徐州等地，並在延安作一夜宿，惟具體路綫尙待馬歇爾抵平後始能決定。聞馬等華北視察日程五日，完舉回平，再赴東北，馬來此可能下榻美大使館，周將住北京飯店，張則尙未定。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕美方已打掃美大使館房舍，供馬歇爾下宿。據悉：張周馬三人巡視共定五日，第一日巡視集寗，張垣兩地，第二日前往濟南，徐州，第三日新鄉，太原，第四日延安，第五日由延安返平。隨行者有隨員及美國男女記者數人。</p>

<h3>蘇司令公開承認　瀋機件搬往蘇聯</h3>
<p>〔合衆社瀋陽廿五日電〕瀋陽區蘇駐軍司令史丹凱維區將軍，今日向英美記者承認，謂蘇聯已將瀋陽若干工廠內重機件設備搬去，但史氏堅稱，此舉乃完全吻合英美蘇三强先前所成立之協議者。當詢以該項協議係在何次三强會議中成立時，渠答謂：「或在雅爾達，或在柏林，予不能確定究係出自何次會議」。史丹凱維區將軍為蘇聯官方對於此事第一次予以公開承認之一人。</p>
<p>據實答覆</p>
<p>外國記者九人，於史將軍舉行招待時，突然提出該項問題，彼等未獲正式核准，曾赴瀋陽若干工廠視察。史丹凱維區初避不作答，後經英美記者率直吿以曾自各方面獲得蘇方搬走重機件之報吿，及曾親見不少證據，彼乃據實答覆。記者詢以已否將大部機件送往蘇聯國內，史氏少停後即答曰：「或許如此」。渠並謂：「即使在歐洲美軍駐在之地區內，亦有若干敵人之軍事設備與製造戰具之機件，被送往蘇聯」。渠以爲東北之情形，正復相同。</p>
<p>會談中斷</p>
<p>當渠將此迄未知悉之協議完全透認以後，潘陽區中國駐軍司令彭璧生將軍，適於此際步入室內，會談遂迅吿小斷。史丹凱維區將軍於接見英美記者時曾宣稱：瀋陽工廠現在　注軍守衛下者，僅佔百分之十十，其餘百分之九十，俱未加以守衛。渠强調謂：蘇軍之　衛工廠，「為阻止潘陽市民之掠奪」，深盼華方速即成立彼等自己之警衛云。史氏於其總部之個人辦公室內接見記者，接見時，胸佩勛章，其神情頗類紅軍紀念節日慶祝時之姿態，蓋「大部紅軍正忙於保衛工廠」耳。</p>
<p>一切停頓</p>
<p>瀋陽普會成爲遠東一大工業城，且有「東北之支加哥」之稱，擁有人口兩百餘萬，現除爲蘇軍之消費而略產啤酒，伏加酒，與紙烟等物外，一切生產俱吿停頓。瀋陽昔有工廠四千五百七十所，內包括日人在戰時開足馬力，以生產汽車，機東，飛機，軍火，機件及各式紡織物之第一二流工廠九百四十八所。目前開工者祇二十所，此中十五家之經理為華人，五家爲蘇聯人，但該廿廠均由蘇方管制保衛。其他工廠，大部祇剩一空殼，或內部物件已遭焚如，或機件設備全被搬走，所餘殘物，嗣又被爬荒小竊偸掠一空，凡稍有價值之物，皆被彼等拿走，俾圖敬延殘喘於此汚穢而疾病蔓延之死城。</p>
<p>國軍營房</p>
<p>有廠房已空之工廠廿家，現被當作中國軍險之營舍。每一重要工廠，不論應用與吾，皆由蘇軍守衛，蘇軍士兵大抵駐在工廠四週之石牆內，以防夜襲。較小與不重要之工廠，凡已遭掠奪者，皆無蘇軍守衛，任使路人入內拾取木屑，煤塊棉絮等引火物。潘陽區內，無一工廠，係由華軍守衛者，即使名義上由華人管理之工廠，亦然如此。隨同英美記者巡視各工廠之某中國軍官告予（記者自稱）謂：「余等並無中國衛兵，因各廠廠房皆相聯接，可能與鄰近之蘇軍衛兵發生事故且亦無多少足以保衛者耳」云。</p>

<h3>社論　開放外匯市塲以後</h3>
<p>開放外滙市塲案，和貿易進出口辦法，同時山國防最高委員會通過，其要點可歸納如下：</p>
<p>一、廢止現行之官價外滙率。</p>
<p>二、不規定比率，而採用所謂外滙幅度辦法。</p>
<p>三、管理外滙，及進出口貿易。</p>
<p>四、外幣、鈔票、及黃金，同樣山中央銀行買賣。</p>
<p>五、中央銀行，對於上項業務，得指定若干共他銀行共同担任，所謂其他銀行，亦並未規定必須是華商銀行。</p>
<p>我們對於以上各項辦法，大體上很同意，因為（一）國際貿易，從此可以恢復。（二）貨暢其流，物資的供求，可以得釗相當的調節。（三）中央銀行，如果確能察酌市面情形，並依供求實况，隨時買賣外滙，則金價和一般物價的波動，可望逐漸和緩下來。（四）市塲上的遊資，得到了一個出路。（五）洋貨的進口，分為（A）自由（B）許可，和（C）禁止三類，頗合一般人的願望。因此戮們對於上項辦灶，毋寗說是：決定得太遲了。</p>
<p>同時，却也有幾點，還値得注意，第一，進出口貿易以外的外滙，還沒有嚴密規定。那麼，黑市滙票有來源叉因為C·B兩項進口貨，都不易自由買到外滙，那麼，黑市滙票有需要。第二，許可進口的貨物，和禁止進口的貨物，如須進口，當然須經過許可或特准。至於自由進口的貨物，顧名思義，應可自由進口了。但購買滙票時，須向銀行提供證明，此項證明之手續，不知怎樣？假如輸入設計臨時委員會統監籌劃，對於進口貨物的數量及價値，認為有「互相配合，避免重複與麼費時，」是項目出進口貨物，是否亦在調整之列？第三，所謂滙價的幅度，其底限或富與現時的黑市相近，以避免物價過度的衝動，但其最高限度，不知相去多少？照理論說：這個幅度，亦許察酌市面情形，依照供求實况，經過相當時期，可以相機移動，以求適合於實際情形，次非一成不變的，政府所以不規定外滙比率，而毅然採取滙幅，其主要的原因，或當在是。但是變動太易，則揣測紛起，很可以刺激投機，使一般物價的波動，依舊得不到緩和，而進出口貨的成本，也就不易確實計算，其於國計民生，影響太大，所以進個幅度，總希望把握得住，不可讓他過於流動。而且這個幅度，也不可過寬，使投機搗亂之徒，依奮可以興風作浪，搗亂整個的經濟界。</p>
<p>自由進口的貨物，照進出口貿易辦法第二條規定，其範團頗為廣泛。為保護我國幼稚的工業起見，除掉這個辦法之外，我們還希望運用共他的辦法，如關稅政策之類來加以適當的補充。因為這個滙幅的底限，如果是接近今日的黑市滙價，那麼，今日的物價，已經太高了。在安定民生這一方面來說：固嫌其不足，而國外貨價與國內貨價相去尙遠，在威脅國內工業　一方面來說：還是綽乎有餘。所以開放外滙市場，雖是打開經濟難關的要　，却不能認為解次當前經濟問題的唯一辦該。</p>
<p>至於管理外滙和管理進出口貿易，在戰爭期間，已有過相當的經騐，其成效如何，現在不必去批評。好得這一次的辦法，是由國防最高委員會掌握其最高的監督權，而另設一輸入設計臨時委員會，以負責其事，共人選，其職掌，俱定得十分周密，我們相信：過去種種不合理，和不切事實的現象，總不會申演於將來。</p>

<h3>武漢增設國民學校　救濟適齡失學兒童</h3>
<p>〔本報武漢通訊〕漢口市政府以本市兒童失學問題，情勢嚴重，本月內請求入學新生約以萬計，敎育科調查本市學齡兒童數，依　定比例計算，有六萬三千名，依照敎部　法，每班以四十名計，應設一千七百五十班始可收容，目前小學經費支給標準，每班約六萬元，計月支共需一萬萬零五百萬元，市府以財力缺乏，對此項巨大小學經費，更感無法補助，同時國民敎育僅佔敎育事業一部份，其他中學職業社會敎育，均須配合舉辦，市府為謀今後敎育之普遍改進起見，特於昨日（十九）下午二時，召集所屬財政，警察兩局局長，有關參事·科長·各區區長·及市商會，市工會整理委員常務委員在市府會議廳舉行國民敎育座談會。討論市府普遍設立國民學校辦法，敎科并提出下列各項討論，（一）改漢市所有私立小學為國民學校，（二）以區為單位，每區設中國民民所，經費由鄕鎭保甲籌出，（四）總工會·總商會·發動各職業工會·校數及失學學生情形，小學生失學數在三萬人以上，當經會議決定，遵照上項提議，以解決失學兒童就學問題。</p>

<p>請求各點送部核辦</p>
<p>又遊行行列，原定至外交部駐滬辦事處請願，以時間關係，故臨時作罷，於抵蘇領署後，即推代表傳忠仁·朱榮慶二人，赴外交部駐滬辦事處，呈遞致蘇聯史太林大元帥函一件，請求轉達，并要求發表談話，轉告同學。當由該處秘書接見，并由陳主任國廉發表談話，略謂：各位同胞和各位同學之愛國熱忱，本人非常感動，敢對各位保證政府在最英明的蔣主席領導之下，絕不會做出喪權辱國的事，東北問題必可獲得合理解決。國民之共同主張，政府當然聽取。今天各位所請求各點，當即報告外交部，轉陳政府核辦。至於囑為送致史達林元帥函，本處當亦一併轉請核送，但仍希望各位一切行動，務勿超越法律範圍，以免徒增國家困難云。</p>

<h3>陳納德將軍招待本市各報記者　盛稱中國地大物博亟應建立放空工業　願繼續助吾空運事業進展</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美前十四航空隊隊長「飛虎將軍」陳納德，昨日下午三時，在大西路樂怡飯店首次在華招待記者，由航空委員會外事科科長舒伯炎上校作陪，到各報記者二十餘人。會中陳將軍對於建設中國航空事業，極為關懷，并表示願有所貢獻。</p>
<p>陳將軍稱：在其遍歷中國內地各處後，感到中國陸上交通及空運交通均極缺乏，急宜加速改進。但目前欲在短時期內求陸上交通之發達，似不可能。故應先建設空運交通，自辦航空業。中國有極豐富之建築飛機材料，儘可利用。此外其他物產眾多，可暢銷外國市場，但無交通工具運輸，實屬最大困難。陳將軍曾以此意見貢獻蔣主席，頗蒙贊同，亦加採納。陳將軍謂其目前尚無確實計劃，但有甚多意見。并述當七七事變發生時，本人正在洛陽，遇中日戰事爆發，即電蔣主席表示其甚願為中國效勞，後昨主席覆電，接受其意見，故即趨赴南京，後即開始訓練中國空軍。此次再度來華，仍盼能盡力協助中國空運事業之進展。</p>
<p>陳將軍謂中國具有世界最大之機場，即雲南之陸良機場，其規模之大，確可居各國之上。戰後空運重要當與戰時相等，甚至更重於戰時。本人此次由舊金山抵滬，搭乘普通飛機，僅費時五十四小時。現美國民航公司正計劃，將來自舊金山起飛，在檀香山及關島稍作停留，飛抵上海，可能僅需三十小時。此計劃於本年七月當可實現。陳將軍又語記者，謂擬在滬勾留若干時日後，即赴南京。</p>

<h3>嚴厲取締下金鈔繼續跌落　匯率問題引入注意</h3>
<p>粭赤昨以報載最高國防會議通過，開放外匯政策之訊，人心對外匯及黃金掛牌問題，又漸趨樂觀，市價繼續見疲，晨開已退至一六五萬，賣氣轉熾，同時四川路方面風聲鶴淚，環境不利，午前步跌至一四五萬左右，美鈔漸開振作，逢低游資吸納，收市又回好至一五七萬以上，較前收再跌十五萬，午後美鈔不支，金價亦略下游，查禁更嚴，交易更為閑散，銀樓飾金仍無掛牌，紋銀二千元，銀元依舊供過於求，退至九〇〇元內外，暗折轉鬆，息價約自一角半至二角。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔昨因政府對外匯有整個方案決定，一般心理對匯率又有種種揣測，美匯有二千對一之看法，賣戶一度潮湧，晟開二五一〇元，供戶甚殷，最低步降至二三五〇元以下，羅比因印棉結款而反漲，（自五二〇元升為五四〇元）港票因之未動，致助長買氣，又復回好至二四〇〇元關外，結果較前收跌一五〇元，港票新貨平疲，老貨受羅比所影響，甚為平穩，低價不易獲得頭寸，賣買價再告拔開，結果以賣價而論，老貨微升，新貨則稍挫。</p>
<h3>證券下瀉</h3>
<p>公債丙種自一七〇〇元逐步減小至一四五〇元以下，戊種步降至一二〇〇元，雜牌千元關口，華股亦帶軟，永紗自二二〇〇元退至二千關邊，美亞一七〇〇元降為一六〇〇元光景，景福一一五元退至一〇五元左右，均軋小一成，洋股迫於環境，賣價較盛，但潛勢帶堅，凡此皆屬約價，難得較公開之成交，大致大股小一成左右，小型股較為穩定，約小半成左右。</p>
<h3>紗價步降</h3>
<p>昨日紗市突轉下游，因報載政府當局即將開放外匯，同時金價下瀉，致人心虛軟，十六支光明晨初開盤為一百零三萬，旋即步步下降至九十萬，其他如廿支特雙馬降至一百零八萬，廿支小型紗價近日已與十六支光明售價不相上下，可謂奇跡，然十六支光明買賣仍較廿支為活絡，蓋光明之進出，以投機性居多也，綜計昨市各支粗細紗綫均較上日小六萬至十萬之譜，紡建昨日平售為花色棉布云。</p>
<h3>花銷暢達　巴西花首次做開</h3>
<p>昨日現棉市況平疲，惟交易依然暢達，緣黃金與紗價鬆動，而一般執貨者鑒於銀根緊迫，略有遷就，紡建公司採辦特濃，計進一千三四百件之鉅，悉數為細絨原料，巴西花已有第一次做開，價較上日見軟，約小一二千元云。</p>
<h3>絲綢續疲</h3>
<p>昨市絲綢仍趨疲落，人心虛軟，市況寂靜，人造絲一二〇號天橋現貨晨開一百廿六萬元，後即降小做二百二十萬元，半光需殷，高於有光，價開二百三十萬元，廠絲另擔稍疲，計短五萬元，綢貨一蹶不振，美亞被面較上日短十一萬元強，大誠格璧縐最大做四千三百六十元，最後做四千一百元，較上日小四百六十元。</p>
<h3>米市漸定　豆油來源甚旺</h3>
<p>昨日米市早晨開盤略緊，奈消化平平，午時依然軟化，欲振無力，結果仍趨定局，勢將轉入盤旋之格，油市以青島來源甚旺，依然不振，價格續見步削，再低千餘元，豆餅平平，黃豆亦少上落，高貨略見挺秀，芝蔴回小一二千元，生仁堅穩之狀，铁皮升百元，麺粉內地堅昂，甬帮略有問津，回漲一二百元，又訊，上週本埠到米數量，據向米市場管委會調查所得，共為五〇四九二石，其內容為白粳一〇五二二石，薄稻一二五九六石，洋秈三九三八石，杜秈二三二六石，蕪秈一九二五〇石，白元九二五石，陰元九三五石，此外零星運到者，尚未列入，估計約在六萬石左右云。</p>
<h3>茶市交易見減</h3>
<p>日來本市各茶葉出品行號，鑒於海外貿易不久即可推動，除將旗鼓重整外，復忙於搜集大批紅綠茶樣寄往國外，至於本市茶葉市況，仍由本街店莊及客帮頻頻問津，但貨方心思亟挺，一味守持少出，故做開交易依然不多，但市氣堅穩如故。</p>
<h3>商情摘要</h3>
<p>工業原料市價因連日上升過巨，廠方暫停進貨，執貨者雖圖板持，趨勢已不如前之堅挺。</p>
<p>糖市平疲，但因貨方不願脫手，礦鮮成交，中以興化白價較亂，自六萬五千元至七萬元，其關鍵在稅單號碼是否相符，對則客銷可動，搜購有人，否則以本街銷呆，乏人聞津，敵產局　公會標售之糖，昨因手續不及，并未舉行。</p>
<p>棉面初開比昨午場外高二三千元，後因金價報小而告疲勢，結果與昨市相彷彿，成交頗少。</p>
<p>德孚洋行清理處售盤據訊又將遞增，其他洋商染料洋行雖有定貨，惜因運輸船隻關係未能確定期限，因之行號扳價亦緊。</p>
<p>棉織品因客銷呆滯，價見下挫，同業均抱觀望心理。</p>
<p>固本剪刀皂銷路呆滯，略為下降，黃祥茂光華等走銷頗暢，價告俏俐，跌價頗烈，洋燭喊價與昨日相彷。</p>
<p>香煙晟開人心轉堅，加以外銷甚暢，華商煙除大高樂百萬金平穩外，餘均一致上漲。</p>

<h3>Foreign Exchange Rate Announcement on Monday / Pei Tsu-yi Appointed President of the Central Bank / National Government Issued Order Yesterday Approving Yu Hung-chun's Resignation from Concurrent Post / President Song Arrived in Shanghai by Plane from Chongqing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] After the Supreme National Defense Council approved the opening of the foreign exchange market, the market prices of gold and banknotes in Chongqing immediately plummeted. The price of gold fell by 17,800 yuan per tael today, with the closing price for factory bars at 13,500 yuan, and U.S. dollars at 1,940 yuan. The Central Bank will announce foreign exchange rates on March 4 (Monday). (The "Provisional Measures for the Central Bank's Management of Foreign Exchange" is published in full on the fourth page; please refer to it.)</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] The National Government issued an order on the 26th: Yu Hung-chun, concurrently the president of the Central Bank, requested to resign. Yu Hung-chun's request to be relieved of his concurrent post is approved. This order. Pei Tsu-yi is specially appointed as the president of the Central Bank. This order.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 26th] Chinese and foreign business figures here have expressed their welcome for the new foreign exchange regulations set by the government. A certain merchant said: This regulation has already achieved half the effect of stabilizing China's monetary system. General opinion holds that the new regulations are intended to allow the exchange rate to automatically find its level after trade is restored. The purposes of the new regulations are, first, to prevent the escape of capital; second, to curb speculation; and third, to encourage exports.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] President Song flew from Chongqing to Shanghai at 2:00 PM on the 26th. According to a telegram from Hankou, President Song arrived in this city by plane at approximately 6:00 PM on the 26th. Due to inclement weather, he landed here and is scheduled to continue his flight to Shanghai on the morning of the 27th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] After the news that the Supreme National Defense Council had approved the opening of the foreign exchange market was revealed, the market prices of gold, foreign currencies, securities, etc., in this city were quite shaken. General speculation is that, with the opening of foreign exchange trading, foreign trade is expected to resume, and perhaps a more favorable exchange rate can be obtained as a result. However, some are taking a wait-and-see attitude because the classification methods for new imported goods have not yet been announced, and they are uncertain about the extent of the application and permit procedures that the government will adopt. As a result, the general market situation was quite volatile when the news was first released, but eventually, there was a uniform decline. Gold saw a low price of 1.46 million, and U.S. dollars once saw a minimum price of 2,330 yuan. Other markets, such as Chinese and foreign stock markets and price markets, all declined, which shows that the authorities' new foreign exchange measures have had a preliminary stabilizing effect on the Shanghai market. A reporter visited the person in charge of the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance yesterday, who said: The authorities' plan to open the foreign exchange market has only been seen in the newspapers, and the office has not yet received instructions from the authorities. However, he firmly believes that detailed implementation measures will be issued soon, and they will be handled accordingly to achieve the central government's aim of stabilizing finance and leveling prices. According to general observation: In the future, the government will allow the people to purchase and import goods needed for industry and people's livelihoods at any time without the government's permission, which will be of great benefit to the development of domestic industry and the future of the national economy. Moreover, the government will have the Central Bank and designated banks assess market conditions and supply and demand realities to provide appropriate adjustments for the supply and purchase of foreign exchange, so that transitional fluctuations can be prevented. The buying and selling of foreign currency banknotes and gold will also be handled according to the same principle, and 500 million U.S. dollars will be allocated as legal tender reserves. In the future, the government can fully utilize its open market trading policy to achieve the significant effect of stabilizing the financial market. Therefore, it is expected that the market conditions of foreign exchange, foreign currencies, gold, securities, etc., will gradually be brought into line, and prices will become more stable, and foreign trade, which has been uncertain, can embark on a smooth path.</p>

<h3>Mediation Department Protests / Petition Group Incident</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] The protest letter, signed by Zheng Jiemin, Ye Jianying, and Robertson, three commissioners of the Military Mediation Department, was delivered to the Beiping Municipal Government on the 21st. It lodged a serious protest against the entry of over a thousand petitioners from the Hebei refugee group on the 20th, who crowded into the department, shouting, fighting, and hindering work. It demanded that Mayor Xiong take appropriate and effective measures to ensure the safety and freedom of the department's government, CCP, and U.S. offices, residences, and staff, so that the department can have the conditions to continue its peace work. The three commissioners solemnly stated in the protest letter that, at the time of submitting the protest letter, they fully understood and respected all the freedom of rights of the people, and had no intention of opposing or interfering. In addition, the three commissioners also telegraphed Chairman Chiang, requesting him to order the relevant authorities to fulfill their responsibility to protect the department. The Military Mediation Department may issue a public statement on this matter in the next two days.</p>
<h3>Chairman Will Go to Chongqing Suburbs and Nanjing Today / Give Instructions to Political School Students / Negotiations with the Soviet Union Based on Treaties</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 26th] Chairman Chiang summoned the Secretary-General and Yu Dingchang at 3:15 PM today. The content of the conversation was reportedly related to the current general situation. According to reliable information: Chairman Chiang will go to Nanquan on the 27th to give instructions to the students of the political school and listen to their opinions on national affairs.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 26th] Chairman Chiang sent Chen Lifu to the Central Political School yesterday to dissuade students from marching, because the school is an organization of the Kuomintang, but the students did not listen. According to reports: The gate of Yenching University in Chengdu was destroyed because students of the school did not participate in the first demonstration march. Yenching students fasted for one day on Monday to protest this, but organized a patriotic group to support other students' views on the Northeast issue.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 26th] Chairman Chiang issued instructions to the Northeast Headquarters, stipulating that negotiations with the Soviet Union must be based on respect for the Sino-Soviet Treaty, comply with Chinese law, and not contradict other international agreements signed by China. This is a clear indication to the Soviet Union and the world that China will not make any concessions in the Nine Eastern Provinces that would damage China's integrity. However, the general public believes that the clauses of the Sino-Soviet Treaty were actually decided by the Big Three at the Yalta Conference, and China had no choice but to accept them, which is truly infuriating.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 26th] According to the Communist Party here, the Chengdu "Xinhua Daily" office has been destroyed by the "Gestapo." This happened after the Chengdu students' march last Sunday.</p>
<h3>Students Continue to March</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The capital's various circles, in order to demand that the Soviet Union withdraw its troops stationed in the Northeast and oppose the special status of the Northeast, held an unprecedented national salvation demonstration march today in the overcast and drizzling rain. Participants included over 10,000 professors from temporary universities and representatives from the industrial, agricultural, commercial, and academic sectors. Among them, Professor Chen Cangfu, who is in his sixties and marched fourteen years ago because the Northeast was invaded by Japanese imperialism, once again walked among the marchers, which is most touching. The marching crowd followed a band playing the "March of the Volunteers," advancing mightily, and traffic was blocked for a time. They shouted slogans along the way, posted slogans, and gave speeches in groups, their emotions were tense and passionate, and the citizens stood and watched, all feeling inspired and moved. In many places, the masses spontaneously shouted slogans to respond to the roar of the marching crowd. Today's march did not encounter any accidents because the police and military police had made arrangements for protection in advance.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] Over 10,000 students in the Nan'an district of Chongqing held a patriotic march today for the Northeast issue. When they arrived at the National Government, they circled the gate once, and thirty representatives presented their opinions on national affairs to Chairman Chiang. Xu Jingzhi, Director of the Document Bureau of the Civil Affairs Office, received them and gave a speech, which stated: Chairman Chiang highly praised the patriotic actions, and earnestly instructed yesterday that students should pay attention to reason on national affairs, and not increase the government's difficulties or damage international friendship. The government has been striving for the complete victory and integrity of China's territory for more than twenty years. Soviet friendship is not only necessary for us, but also a strong guarantee for world peace. Regarding the Northeast issue, the chairman also instructed that solutions should be sought under the principles of not violating government laws and regulations, respecting the Sino-Soviet Treaty, and not undermining national sovereignty and territorial integrity. He hoped that the students would trust the government.</p>
<h3>The Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee Is Approaching / Central Committee Members Began to Register Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] Central Committee members of the Second Plenary Session began to register at the Secretariat of the Central Party Headquarters today. A total of seventy-two Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members registered on the first day, including forty-seven Executive Committee members and twenty-five Supervisory Committee members.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 26th] The Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee will open on March 1, and the session will last approximately seven days. The issue of reorganizing the government will be left for final discussion.</p>
<h3>Zhang, Zhou, and Marshall Will Go to North China / Scheduled for a Five-Day Inspection / May Go to the Northeast After Returning to Beiping from Yan'an</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 26th] Marshall is definitely planning to go to the Northeast. The time will be after inspecting various parts of North China. The scope of work of the Military Mediation Department will be expanded to the Northeast, and the working hours will also be extended because he is still responsible for supervising the troop reduction task. Marshall, Zhang, Zhou, etc., may come to Beiping on the 27th or 28th. The areas to be visited by the three have been tentatively set as Jining, Jinan, Zhangjiakou, Xinxiang, and Taiyuan, and they will spend one night in Yan'an. However, the specific route will be decided only after Marshall arrives in Beiping. It is heard that Marshall's and others' North China inspection itinerary is five days. After completing the trip, they will return to Beiping and then go to the Northeast. Marshall may stay at the American Embassy, Zhou will stay at the Beijing Hotel, and Zhang has not yet decided.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 26th] The American side has cleaned the houses of the American Embassy for Marshall to stay in. It is learned that the inspection trip of the three, Zhang, Zhou, and Marshall, is scheduled for five days. On the first day, they will inspect Jining and Zhangjiakou. On the second day, they will go to Jinan and Xuzhou. On the third day, they will go to Xinxiang and Taiyuan. On the fourth day, they will go to Yan'an. On the fifth day, they will return to Beiping from Yan'an. The entourage includes attendants and several American male and female reporters.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 26th] The purpose of the visit to Beiping by Marshall, Zhang Zhizhong, and Zhou Enlai is to review the achievements of the Executive Headquarters in the past six weeks and to take the lead in inspecting the actual situation in various conflict areas. The Executive Headquarters has issued 14 joint communiqués in the past six weeks, which in itself can be considered an important achievement. The Executive Headquarters has three main tasks: (1) Fulfilling the order to cease conflict, which is almost complete; (2) Supervising the restoration of transportation in North and Central China, which is also underway; (3) Assisting in the evacuation of Japanese nationals from North China. The Executive Headquarters announced on February 16 that this work had begun.</p>
<h3>Soviet Commander Publicly Admits / Shenyang Machinery Was Moved to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Shenyang, 25th] General Stankevich, commander of the Soviet garrison in the Shenyang area, admitted to British and American reporters today that the Soviet Union had moved heavy machinery and equipment from several factories in Shenyang. However, Stankevich insisted that this move was fully in line with the agreement previously established by the three powers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. When asked in which Three-Power Conference the agreement was established, he replied: "Perhaps in Yalta, or in Berlin, I cannot be sure which conference it came from." General Stankevich is one of the first Soviet officials to publicly acknowledge this matter.</p>
<p>Responding Honestly</p>
<p>Nine foreign reporters suddenly raised the issue during the reception held by General Shi. They had visited several factories in Shenyang without formal approval. Shi Dan-Ke Weiqu initially avoided answering, but after the British and American reporters frankly told him that they had received reports from various sources that the Soviet side had moved heavy machinery, and that they had personally seen a lot of evidence, he answered truthfully. When reporters asked whether most of the machinery had been sent to the Soviet Union, Shi paused for a moment and then replied: "Perhaps so." He also said: "Even in the areas in Europe where the U.S. military is stationed, some enemy military equipment and machinery for manufacturing war equipment are being sent to the Soviet Union." He believed that the situation in the Northeast was the same.</p>
<p>Meeting Interrupted</p>
<p>Just as he had fully acknowledged this hitherto unknown agreement, General Peng Bisheng, commander of the Chinese garrison in the Panyang area, happened to walk into the room, and the meeting quickly came to a short end. When receiving British and American reporters, General Shi Dan-Ke Weiqu declared: Only 10% of the factories in Shenyang are now guarded by Soviet troops, and the remaining 90% are not guarded. He emphasized that the Soviet army's guarding of factories was "to prevent looting by the citizens of Panyang," and he hoped that the Chinese side would quickly establish their own guards. Shi met with reporters in his personal office at his headquarters, wearing medals and looking very much like he was celebrating the Red Army Anniversary, as "most of the Red Army is busy protecting the factories."</p>
<p>Everything is at a Standstill</p>
<p>Shenyang used to be a major industrial city in the Far East and was known as the "Chicago of the Northeast," with a population of over two million. Now, except for producing a little beer, vodka, and cigarettes for the Soviet army's consumption, all production has come to a standstill. Shenyang used to have 4,570 factories, including 948 first- and second-rate factories that Japanese used to run at full capacity during the war to produce automobiles, machinery, airplanes, munitions, machinery, and various textiles. Currently, only 20 are open, of which 15 are managed by Chinese and 5 by Soviets, but all 20 factories are controlled and guarded by the Soviet side. Most of the other factories are just empty shells, or the internal objects have been burned, or the machinery and equipment have been completely moved away, and the remaining remnants have been looted and stolen by scavengers, who have taken away anything of value to try to eke out a living in this filthy and disease-ridden city of death.</p>
<p>National Army Barracks</p>
<p>Twenty factories with empty factory buildings are now being used as barracks for Chinese troops. Every important factory, whether usable or not, is guarded by Soviet troops. Soviet soldiers mostly reside inside the stone walls around the factories to prevent night attacks. Smaller and unimportant factories that have been looted are not guarded by Soviet troops, allowing passersby to enter and pick up firewood, coal pieces, cotton batting, and other fire starters. No factory in the Panyang area is guarded by Chinese troops, even the factories nominally managed by Chinese. A Chinese military officer who accompanied the British and American reporters to inspect the factories told (the reporter claimed): "We do not have any Chinese guards, because the factory buildings are connected to each other and may cause accidents with the nearby Soviet guards, and there are not enough to protect them."</p>

<p>Section 1: Within twelve months of the promulgation of this agreement, the government should demobilize all troops beyond the ninety divisions, and the CCP should demobilize all troops beyond the eighteen divisions. Demobilization should begin immediately, with roughly one-twelfth of the total demobilization personnel being reduced each month. Within three weeks of the promulgation of this agreement, the government should prepare a roster of the ninety divisions to be retained and the order of troop demobilization for the first two months. During the same period, the CCP should prepare a detailed roster of its troops, specifying their nature, strength, weapons, the names of commanders above the brigade level, and the locations of each unit.

<p>Section 3: Within six months after the twelve months, the four army groups mentioned in the above section should be reorganized into six independent corps, with four corps each including one government army division and two CCP army divisions, and two corps each including two government army divisions and one CCP army division. Thereafter, the army groups should be abolished.</p>

<h3>Editorial: After the Opening of the Foreign Exchange Market</h3>
<p>The plan to open the foreign exchange market, along with measures for trade import and export, was simultaneously passed by the Supreme National Defense Council. Its main points can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Abolish the current official foreign exchange rate.</p>
<p>2.  Do not stipulate a rate, but adopt the so-called foreign exchange margin method.</p>
<p>3.  Manage foreign exchange and import and export trade.</p>
<p>4.  The Central Bank buys and sells foreign currency, banknotes, and gold in the same way.</p>
<p>5.  The Central Bank may designate several other banks to jointly undertake the above business. These so-called other banks are not required to be Chinese banks.</p>
<p>We generally agree with the above measures, because (1) international trade can be restored from now on; (2) the free flow of goods and the supply and demand of materials can be adequately adjusted; (3) if the Central Bank can truly consider the market situation and buy and sell foreign exchange at any time according to the actual supply and demand, the fluctuations in gold prices and general prices can be expected to gradually slow down; (4) the floating capital in the market has found an outlet; (5) the import of foreign goods is divided into three categories: (A) free, (B) permitted, and (C) prohibited, which is quite in line with the general public's wishes. Therefore, we must say that the above measures were decided too late.</p>
<p>At the same time, there are still a few points that deserve attention. First, there are no strict regulations on foreign exchange other than import and export trade. Then, black market drafts have a source. Also, because C and B import goods are not easy to freely buy foreign exchange, then black market drafts are needed. Second, goods permitted for import and goods prohibited for import, if they need to be imported, of course, must be subject to permission or special approval. As for goods that are freely imported, as the name suggests, should be freely imported. However, when purchasing drafts, proof must be provided to the bank. What are the procedures for this proof? If the Temporary Committee for Import Design plans as a whole, and believes that the quantity and value of imported goods should be "mutually coordinated to avoid duplication and waste," are the items of import and export goods also subject to adjustment? Third, the so-called foreign exchange margin, whether its lower limit is close to the current black market, in order to avoid excessive price shocks, but its upper limit, how far is it? In theory, this margin may be adjusted from time to time after a considerable period of time, in accordance with the market situation and the actual supply and demand, in order to be suitable for the actual situation, rather than being immutable. The main reason why the government does not stipulate the foreign exchange rate, but resolutely adopts the foreign exchange margin, may be this. However, if the change is too easy, speculation will arise, which can stimulate speculation and make the fluctuations in general prices unable to be缓和, and the cost of import and export goods will not be easy to calculate accurately, which has too much impact on the national economy and people's livelihood. Therefore, this margin should always be grasped and not allowed to be too fluid. Moreover, this margin should not be too wide, so that speculators can still make waves and disrupt the entire economy.</p>
<p>The goods that can be freely imported, as stipulated in Article 2 of the Import and Export Trade Measures, have a wide range. In order to protect our country's fledgling industry, in addition to this method, we also hope to use other methods, such as tariff policies, to make appropriate supplements. Because the lower limit of this foreign exchange margin, if it is close to today's black market foreign exchange rate, then today's prices are already too high. In terms of stabilizing people's livelihood, it is not enough, and the difference between foreign goods prices and domestic goods prices is still far away. In terms of threatening domestic industry, it is still more than enough. Therefore, opening the foreign exchange market is an important point in opening up economic difficulties, but it cannot be considered the only solution to the current economic problem.</p>
<p>As for the management of foreign exchange and the management of import and export trade, there has been considerable experience during the war period. What is the effect, there is no need to criticize now. Fortunately, this time, the Supreme National Defense Council is in charge of its highest supervisory power, and a Temporary Committee for Import Design is set up to be responsible for it. The candidates and their responsibilities are set very carefully. We believe that the various unreasonable and unrealistic phenomena of the past will not be repeated in the future.</p>

<h3>Wuhan Increases Number of National Schools; Provides Relief to School-Age Children Out of School</h3>
<p>[Our Wuhan Correspondent] The Hankou Municipal Government considers the problem of children out of school in the city to be severe. This month, the number of new students requesting admission is estimated to be around 10,000. According to an investigation by the Education Department, the number of school-age children in the city, calculated according to a certain ratio, is 63,000. According to the regulations of the Ministry of Education, each class should have 40 students, requiring the establishment of 1,750 classes to accommodate all of them. The current standard for primary school funding is approximately 60,000 yuan per class, requiring a total monthly expenditure of 100.5 million yuan. The municipal government, due to a lack of financial resources, feels unable to subsidize such a large amount of funding for primary schools. At the same time, national education only accounts for one part of the education sector. Other secondary vocational and social education programs also need to be organized. To achieve the overall improvement of education in the future, the municipal government convened a national education symposium yesterday (the 19th) at 2 p.m. in the Municipal Government Conference Hall. The meeting was attended by the directors of the Finance and Police Bureaus, relevant advisors, section chiefs, district administrators, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the standing committee members of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. The meeting discussed methods for the municipal government to universally establish national schools. The Education Department also proposed the following items for discussion: (1) Convert all private primary schools in Hankou into national schools; (2) Establish a national school in each district; (3) Funding should be raised by villages and "bao-jia" (ancient Chinese system of civil registration); (4) The Federation of Trade Unions and the Chamber of Commerce should mobilize various trade unions. The number of primary schools and the situation of students out of school were discussed. It was reported that the number of students out of school is over 30,000. The meeting decided to follow the above proposals to solve the problem of school-age children being out of school.</p>
<p>Wuchang: Although the Wuchang area has established five provincial primary schools, their capacity is only over 3,000 students, causing many parents to suffer in recent days because their children cannot attend school. According to officials in charge of national education at the Education Department, according to the central government's orders, primary schools are to be managed by the county and city governments. However, due to relocation and recovery, students are returning to Hankou with their parents, and the municipal organization of Wuchang has not yet been completed. To prevent school-age children from being out of school, the department established five primary schools last year and has plans to continue establishing five more. Due to funding issues, this semester may be difficult to achieve. Currently, the Wuchang Municipal Office is also actively preparing to establish central national schools and national schools in accordance with provincial government orders. In addition, the provincial experimental primary school and the affiliated primary school of the provincial first women's normal school will begin student enrollment soon. The problem of primary school enrollment in Wuchang can be gradually solved.</p>
<h3>Classroom Films: New Teaching Method After the War</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, New York, 25th] Hev writes in the latest issue of "Freedom" magazine that the rapid training of armed forces during World War II led to various new teaching methods, one of which is the use of films in the classroom. Hev explains that before the war, the development of classroom films was very slow, but the training of millions of people in the military required extreme speed, so new teaching methods had to be adopted. The most effective of these was sound films. Therefore, educational films used to teach the armed forces are now being applied to schools. Hev claims that today, schools in all 48 states of the United States are commonly using sound films as a teaching tool. Before showing a film in the classroom, the teacher first describes what the students will see. Then, the students ask questions. In this way, films not only help understanding but also guide creative planning and supplementary reading. However, the teacher is still an important part of this. It is important not to forget that films are just another teaching tool in the hands of the teacher and are used in conjunction with other teaching methods.</p>
<h3>City Primary School Principals' Association Offers Suggestions to the Education Bureau</h3>
<p>[Our City News] The Shanghai Municipal Primary School Principals' Association, in light of the recent soaring prices and difficult living conditions, believes that it is necessary to adjust the salaries of teachers and staff.

Therefore, yesterday morning, the association sent six representatives to meet with Director Gu. Deputy Director Li received them. The representatives presented two points of view: (1) salary adjustment, (2) the addition of detailed and reasonable regulations for dismissing teachers. According to Deputy Director Li, the salaries of primary school teachers and staff are based on the salaries of civil servants, so there is no need to apply. As for the regulations for dismissing teachers, in addition to the regulations of the Ministry of Education, education experts, officials in charge, principals, and teachers in this city will discuss them together in the future to supplement any deficiencies.</p>

<p>Three basketball league games will be held today as usual. The women's division game between Da Hua and Strong Hua will start first. The former has four wins in four games and is tied for the lead with the Green Team. Shen Shuwei, Zhou Zhifang, and others are very skilled, so Strong Hua has no chance of avoiding defeat. The second game is between the Red Team of Division 2 and Dong Hua. Since winning the Morning Friends Cup Division B championship, the Red Team has been working extremely hard.

<p>Da Hua - Strong Hua (Women's) 5:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Dong Hua - Red Team (Division 2) 6:15 p.m.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Circles Uphold Northeast Sovereignty in Protests; Students March in the Rain; Memorial Service Held at Aurora University Oval in Memory of Eight Martyrs</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Although there was continuous wind and rain yesterday, the memorial service for the eight martyrs, including Zhang Huafu, organized by nine organizations including the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Federation of Trade Unions, the National Diplomacy Association, the Northeast Shanghai Hometown Association, and the Student Federation, and the subsequent march, still proceeded as planned.

<p>Mourning National Heroes: Solemn and Grand</p>
<p>In the morning of yesterday, amid the chilling wind and bitter rain, students from across the city held a public memorial service on the large oval of Aurora University. The main memorial platform was set up at the north end of the oval. In the center of the platform hung a portrait of the Father of the Nation and the National Party flag. A wreath was placed under the portrait of the Father of the Nation, with a portrait of the martyr Zhang Xinfu in the middle. A white cloth was hung in front of the platform, with two horizontal banners, one reading "His Spirit Will Endure Forever" and the other "Mourning Our National Hero." Condolences from various parties hung on both sides. Wreaths from the mourners surrounded the four sides of the platform. At 10:15 a.m., the memorial service officially began. Everyone stood in silence and, amid mournful music, bowed three times to the national flag, the Father of the Nation's portrait, and the martyr Zhang Xinfu's portrait. They then observed three minutes of silence for the deceased martyrs. Then, Feng Zhi Zheng, a representative of the presidium, gave a brief and sorrowful report. Hu Tongzeng, a student at the Great China University, reported on Zhang's brief history and the situation in the Northeast. After that, Chen Donglin, a guest attending the memorial service, spoke about the current situation in the Northeast. Chen was a company commander of a certain company of the Thirteenth Army and had just returned from the Northeast, so he was very knowledgeable about the actual situation in the Northeast. After the speech, the public memorial service was held. At that time, the rain was pouring, and everyone stood solemnly in the rain, their blood boiling, almost forgetting that their clothes were soaked.</p>
<p>Request All Points to Be Sent to the Ministry for Review</p>
<p>Also, the marching procession was originally scheduled to petition at the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but due to time constraints, it was temporarily cancelled. After arriving at the Soviet Consulate, they sent two representatives, Chuan Zhongren and Zhu Rongqing, to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to submit a letter addressed to Marshal Stalin of the Soviet Union, requesting it to be forwarded, and requested to make a statement to inform the students. The secretary of the office received them, and Director Chen Guolian made a statement, saying: "I am very moved by the patriotic enthusiasm of all compatriots and students. I dare to guarantee to everyone that under the leadership of the most brilliant Chairman Chiang, the government will never do anything that would cede territory or humiliate the country. The Northeast problem will definitely be resolved reasonably. The government will naturally listen to the common demands of the people. All the points you have requested today will be immediately reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and forwarded to the government for review. As for the letter entrusted to be sent to Marshal Stalin, this office will also forward it for review and delivery. However, I still hope that all of you will not exceed the scope of the law in all your actions, so as not to increase the difficulties of the country."</p>

<h3>Tragic Train Accident Outside the North Station: Train Collision Results in Over Thirty Passenger and Track Worker Casualties; Communication Failure Blamed</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon around 4:30 PM, a train collision occurred outside the North Station in Yangqi, resulting in over thirty casualties. The incident occurred when the No. 43 express train from Beijing to Shanghai, scheduled to arrive at 4:30 PM, reached Yangqi outside Shanghai, only one li (approximately 0.3 miles) from its destination. Suddenly, three freight cars, led by engine C-156, departed from the North Station heading west to change platforms for loading. Upon reaching the location, due to a communication failure between the train and Yangqi, the two engines collided head-on, resulting in the tragic accident.

According to eyewitnesses, most of the injured were the engine crew and baggage handlers, with broken arms and legs and gruesome injuries. They were then sent to the Qiujiang Road Railway Hospital for treatment by ambulance. It is reported that five people died before treatment could be administered at the hospital, fifteen were seriously injured, and eight sustained minor injuries.</p>

Their injuries were minor, and they were discharged shortly after. The Railway Bureau immediately dispatched rescue vehicles to tow the locomotive back to the engine repair shop, and the railway tracks were also repaired immediately. The entire process was relatively quick, so the 9:00 PM night train continued to depart as scheduled.</p>

<h3>General Chennault Hosts a Reception for Newspaper Reporters in This City; Emphasizes China's Vast Land and Resources and the Urgent Need to Establish an Aviation Industry; Expresses Willingness to Continue Assisting the Development of Our Air Transportation Industry</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Former commander of the American 14th Air Force, "Flying Tiger General" Chennault, hosted his first reception for reporters in China yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Le Ee Hotel on Daxilu (now Yan'an West Road). Colonel Shu Boyan, Chief of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Aviation Commission, accompanied him. Over twenty reporters from various newspapers attended. During the reception, General Chennault expressed great concern for the development of China's aviation industry and expressed his willingness to contribute to it.</p>
<p>General Chennault stated that after traveling throughout various parts of inland China, he felt that both China's land transportation and air transportation were extremely lacking and urgently needed to be improved. However, it seems impossible to achieve rapid development of land transportation in the short term. Therefore, priority should be given to developing air transportation and operating our own aviation industry. China has abundant materials for building aircraft, which can be fully utilized. In addition, there are many other products that can be sold in foreign markets, but the lack of transportation is a major obstacle. General Chennault contributed this opinion to President Chiang Kai-shek, who greatly approved and adopted it. General Chennault said that he currently has no concrete plans, but has many ideas. He also mentioned that when the July 7th Incident occurred, he was in Luoyang. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, he telegraphed President Chiang, expressing his willingness to serve China. President Chiang replied, accepting his opinion, so he immediately went to Nanjing and began training the Chinese Air Force. This time, he came to China again, hoping to do his best to assist the development of China's air transportation industry.</p>
<p>General Chennault said that China has the largest airport in the world, namely the Luliang Airport in Yunnan, which is truly the largest in the world in terms of scale. The importance of air transportation after the war will be equal to or even greater than during the war. He traveled from San Francisco to Shanghai on a regular airplane, taking only fifty-four hours. American commercial airlines are now planning flights from San Francisco, with brief stops in Honolulu and Guam, to Shanghai, which may only take thirty hours. This plan is expected to be realized in July of this year. General Chennault also told reporters that he planned to stay in Shanghai for some time before going to Nanjing.</p>

<h3>Strict Crackdown on Speculation Causes Continued Fall in Gold Prices; Exchange Rate Issues Draw Attention</h3>
<p>Yesterday, rumors reported the highest level of the National Defence Council has agreed to release foreign exchange policy news. People's attitude towards foreign exchange and gold quotation issues gradually turned optimistic, market prices continue to appear weak, the early opening had fallen to 1.65 million, selling pressure turned intense, and at the same time the Sichuan Road area was chaotic. The environment was unfavorable, and the price fell to around 1.45 million at noon. The U.S. dollar gradually opened strongly, and low-priced floating capital was absorbed, and the closing price returned to above 1.57 million, a further drop of 150,000 compared with the previous closing. In the afternoon, the U.S. dollar was unsustainable, and the price of gold also slightly decreased. Restrictions were stricter, and transactions were more inactive. Gold jewelry in silver shops still had no quoted prices, silver ingots cost 2,000 yuan, and silver dollars were still oversupplied, falling to around 900 yuan. The black market discount rate loosened, and interest rates were about 15 to 20%.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. dollar was subject to speculations about exchange rates. Because the government has a complete plan for foreign exchange, a common perception sees 2000 to 1 as possible. Sellers surged for a time, the opening price was 2510 yuan, with ample supply, and the lowest price dropped to below 2350 yuan. The rupee rose in response to cotton settlement, (rising from 520 yuan to 540 yuan) so Hong Kong dollars did not move. The rupee helped boost buying, and the price recovered to above 2400 yuan. As a result, the closing price fell 150 yuan compared with the previous closing. New Hong Kong dollars were flat, old Hong Kong dollars were very stable due to the influence of the rupee, and low prices were not easily obtained. The buying and selling prices were further widened. As a result, in terms of selling prices, old Hong Kong dollars rose slightly, while new Hong Kong dollars fell slightly.</p>
<h3>Securities Decline</h3>
<p>Category C public bonds gradually decreased from 1700 yuan to below 1450 yuan, Category E gradually decreased to 1200 yuan, miscellaneous brands traded around 1000 yuan, Chinese stocks also weakened, Yong Yarn retreated from 2200 yuan to near 2000 yuan, Meya decreased from 1700 yuan to around 1600 yuan, and Jingfu retreated from 115 yuan to around 105 yuan, all falling by about 10%. Foreign stocks were forced by the environment, and the selling price was stronger, but the underlying trend was firm. All of this is an estimated price, and it is difficult to obtain more open transactions. Generally, large stocks fell by about 10%, and small stocks were more stable, falling by about 5%.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market suddenly turned downward. Because it was reported that the government authorities would soon open up foreign exchange, and at the same time, the price of gold declined, people's minds were weak. The early opening price of 16-count Guangming was 1.03 million, and then it gradually decreased to 900,000. Other yarns, such as 20-count special Shuangma, decreased to 1.08 million. The price of 20-count small yarn has recently been nearly the same as the price of 16-count Guangming, which can be said to be a miracle. However, 16-count Guangming is still more active in trading than 20-count yarn, because the import and export of Guangming is mostly for speculative purposes. In summary, yesterday's market prices for all counts of coarse and fine yarn decreased by 60,000 to 100,000 compared with the previous day. Fangjian yesterday sold flowered cotton cloth at a flat price.</p>
<h3>Smooth Sales; Brazilian Cotton Opens for the First Time</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market was flat, but trading was still smooth. Because the prices of gold and yarn were loose, and general holders of goods were aware of the tight money supply, they made slight concessions. Fangjian Company purchased a large quantity of special concentrates, totaling 1,300 to 1,400 pieces, all of which were fine-staple raw materials. Brazilian cotton has opened for the first time, and the price was softer than the previous day, decreasing by about 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk Continues to Weaken</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market continued to weaken, people's minds were weak, and the market was quiet. The early opening price of 120-count Tianqiao rayon spot was 1.26 million, and then it decreased to 2.2 million. Semi-gloss was in high demand, higher than gloss, with an opening price of 2.3 million. Factory silk was slightly weaker, decreasing by 50,000 yuan. Silk fabrics were in a slump, the price of Meya bedspreads was 110,000 yuan lower than the previous day, and the highest price of Dacheng Gebi crepe was 4,360 yuan, and the final price was 4,100 yuan, 460 yuan lower than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Gradually Stabilizes; Soybean Oil Sources Very Abundant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market opened slightly tight in the morning, but digestion was average. The price softened again at noon, with no strength to rise. As a result, the market still tended to stabilize and will enter a winding pattern. The oil market was still depressed with abundant sources from Qingdao, and prices continued to decrease, falling by more than 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake was flat, soybeans also had little fluctuation, high-priced goods were slightly outstanding, sesame seeds retreated by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, the raw kernels were firm, the iron skin kernels rose by 100 yuan, and the inland prices of flour were firm and strong. The Ningbo gang products had some inquiries and rebounded by 100 to 200 yuan. Also, according to the investigation by the Rice Market Management Committee, the amount of rice arriving in Shanghai last week was 50,492 shi (approximately 5,049 metric tons). The contents were 10,522 shi of white japonica rice, 12,596 shi of thin indica rice, 3,938 shi of foreign indica rice, 2,326 shi of du indica rice, 19,250 shi of wu indica rice, 925 shi of white yuan rice, and 935 shi of yin yuan rice. In addition, sporadic deliveries were not included, estimated to be around 60,000 shi.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Transactions Decrease</h3>
<p>Recently, various tea producing firms in Shanghai, in view of the fact that overseas trade will soon be promoted, are busy reorganizing their businesses and collecting large batches of black and green tea samples to send abroad. As for the tea market situation in Shanghai, street shops and guest gangs still frequently inquire, but the sellers are eager to hold up prices and only sell a little, so the number of transactions is still small, but the market atmosphere is firm as before.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Because the market prices of industrial raw materials have risen too much in recent days, factories have temporarily stopped purchasing. Although holders of goods are trying to support prices, the trend is not as firm as before.</p>
<p>The sugar market is flat, but because the sellers are unwilling to sell, sparse transactions, the price of Xinghua white sugar is more chaotic, from 65,000 yuan to 70,000 yuan. The key lies in whether the tax bill number matches. If it matches, customer sales can move and some people will buy. Otherwise, sales in this street will be stagnant and no one will ask about it. The sugar auctioned by the Enemy Property Administration and the Public Association was not held yesterday because the procedures were not completed.</p>
<p>The early opening price of cotton cloth was 2,000 to 3,000 yuan higher than the afternoon off-market price yesterday, but the trend weakened due to the price of gold being reported lower. As a result, it was similar to yesterday's market, with very few transactions.</p>
<p>Reports of disposal of assets by the German Defu Foreign Firm will increase again. Although other foreign merchants' dye firms have orders, they are unable to confirm the deadline due to shipping vessel relations, so the firms' prices are also tight.</p>
<p>Cotton textiles' prices have fallen due to sluggish customer sales, and the industry is taking a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p>Guben scissors soap sales are sluggish and have fallen slightly, while Huang Xiangmao and Guanghua sales are very smooth and prices are brisk. Price drops are quite severe, and the bid price of foreign candles is similar to yesterday.</p>
<p>The early opening of cigarettes strengthened people's confidence, and the sales were very smooth. Apart from the stability of the Baiwanjin and Da Gao brands of Chinese merchants, the prices of all others rose uniformly.</p>

<h3>Social Service: Falsely Claiming Loan Funds; Permission to Inform on Classmates to the Principal</h3>
<p>Deal earnestly to avoid abuses</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Loan Committee has accepted applications from a total of 551 schools this session, approving loans for over 7,000 students (including recipients from previous sessions reported in this newspaper). It has notified each school of the list of students and requested that each school publicize the list. Students are encouraged to truthfully report any cases of wealthy students who have obtained loans and infringed upon the rights of others in writing to the principal. The loan will be revoked as a minor punishment. The Committee will begin issuing three-tenths of the total loan amount from yesterday from 3:00 to 6:00 PM daily. The remaining amount is scheduled to be issued around March 5. It is hoped that each school will fill out the receipts issued by the Committee completely, and return them together with the individual forms of the loan recipients for verification and issuance.</p>
