<h3>政院報告行政措施　舉行政治檢討會議　政府改組尚在磋商階段</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕宋子文，翁文灝，蔣夢麟及各部署首長，定三十日下午四時，在國防部招待國民黨國大代表，報吿行政措施，交換意見，對政洽工作加以檢討。　〔本報南京廿九日電〕新憲吿成，國大閉慕後，各方視線咸集中於政府改組，傳說紛歧，大多言之過早。據聞：政府方面曾由吳鐵城，張羣向各黨派有所接洽，徵詢意見，民社黨人士則於昨今陸續去滬，預定在新年前分別接見，下月二日在滬舉行一範圍較廣泛之會議，出席者將不祇該黨各中委，討論範圍除黨內問題外，並將協商參加政府問題。同時靑年黨方面，亦將有一集會，其地點在京在滬尙未定，亦將於會中決定參加政府意見。兩黨決策後，將再一度交換意見，始可向政府作具體表示，大致政府改組問題，或尙要若干時日始可實現。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕民社黨徐傅霖，楊浚明，洪少植等，二十九日上午八時離京赴滬，徐行前語記者。新憲吿成，中國民主政治已推進一大步，今後循序漸進，政府做到明與廉，則武力割據自將消滅，彼巳與政府方面人士就改組政府問題交換多次意見，且曾與吳鐵城，張羣談及。民社黨意見請政府先擬訂改組方案，然後徵詢各黨派及社會賢達意見，吳張對此已表同意，即轉達政府考慮提出。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕雷震定三十晨百滬返京。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨在京各領袖均已紛紛來滬，徐傅霖氏於二十九晚到達，即至愚園路該黨總部休息，楊浚明氏同來。蔣勻田氏於二十八晚到滬，二十九晨即赴範園晤張君勱氏，報吿參加國大經過，當晚即乘夜車赴京轉其安徽故鄉，將在皖休息一星期左右，此後是否留京速絡，或即返上海，則並未決定。</p>
<p>雷震氏來回滬後，二十九晨曾再與張君勱氏晤談，並定當晚即回南京。本市盛傳張君勱氏已允雷氏之請，日內進京之說，民社黨發言人孫賢毅氏巳予否認。孫氏吿記者稱：「君勱先生是否晋京，民社黨是否準備參加政府，目前皆尙未有所決定。」民社黨最近期內即將在滬召開重要會議，討論對今後政局之態度。</p>
<p>蔣勻田氏旋吿記者稱：「憲法現巳通過，以後即將制定之總統選舉法等有關法規、何產生，確為一重要問題。參加國大制憲，與參加政府制定此類法規，性質頗不相同。此類有關法規之制定與憲法之推行，固有密切之關係，惟在野黨派如因該項法規係由立法院制定而即參加立法完，則其所受之的束自又與在國大時不同。」記者即請問在野黨派是否有保持在野身份而同時又參加制定此項法規之可能性，蔣氏答稱：「此即當前問頭所在」。</p>
<p>蔣氏對目前局勢，力避正面答覆，僅稱：「不停戰是談不到憲法的。」惟對於和談之前途，則蔣氏以為「已經不是再和共產黨接洽的問題。如果和談或奔走有用，則前决和談時早即應獲解決辦法。一</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕在舜生氏於廿九清晨由京抵滬，上午曾往範圍訪張君勵氏，因廿九日適為張夫人忌辰，張氏須往眞茹為夫營葬，故未及多談。張氏旋於晚間答訪左氏，交換對國事意見。左氏巳定三十一日返京。</p>
<p>關於政府改組傳說，左氏謂為尙在磋商階段，此事政府固具決心，但在野黨派之是否參加政府，與個人參加不同，所應考慮之問題極多。左氏稱，憲法通過之後，在野黨派如何參加制定由憲法而來之各種「子法」，賓一亟應從速解決之重要問題。現離憲法施行之日雖尙有一年，但明年實為事務極繁之一年，政府應即預定階段，尅期完成各種準備：例如興建一能容四千餘代表開會之禮堂，亦即此項進備之一種。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕靑年教在京諸領袖曾琦·陳啓天·余家菊等，日內營將來滬。叉張羣亦將來滬。</p>
<h3>中共開幹部會議　決定放棄和談另立政府　指示黨徒不斷武裝鬥爭</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平廿九日電〕據確息：中共中央曾於十一月十二日起，召開以毛澤東為主席之軍政黨高級幹部會議，出席者有朱德，劉少奇，廖承志，任弼時，彭德懷，林彪等，其重要決議有（一）一致擁護毛澤東領導中共奮鬥到底，（二）放葉國共和平談判，另行建立政府。（三）充實空軍力量，（四）增强在國際問宣傳力及密在英美。法等國組織中共支部，（五）封鎖各都市及搜羅物資，集中其侵佔區，（六）實施全面民兵政策，强化游擊反運動戰鬥力量。</p>
<p>〔中央社徐林廿九日電〕中共中央局以黨內反對派鬥爭日烈，為加以反整起見，於日前發布命令一件，其內容係奢談軍事之勝利，以證明毛澤東路綫之正確，對和平談判，則强調其無望，並指示其黨徙謂，「政協決議，決無實現和平之可能，武裝鬥爭，不能片刻停止」。「要在打的中問和談，在和談中間還要應尋打的籍口。」現在若停止武裝鬥爭，即為投降「敵人」，「出賣無產階級」，於是證明「祇有毛澤東之思想與路綫」，才是實行「馬列主義之路綫目標」。在宣揚毛澤東之思想，以堅完其黨徙之信仰後，該命令並責令其部從「嚴防與撲滅黨內少數反革命者活動與誘騙，以鞏固共黨基礎」，由此一命令證明，不惟可以深悉共黨毫無和平誠意，且可知毛澤東派排除異己之殘暴作風矣。</p>

<h3>勞資糾紛昨晚獲解決　京各報今日復刋　加薪倍數尙待最後洽商</h3>

<h3>昨日商談經過</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕京民營報紙十四家，於廿八日因工潮停刊後，廿九日仍未能恢復出版，未加人報聯之南京日報亦未出版。因此由央日報，和平日報兩報，及小型之社會日報，均銷行迅速，滬上遂京各報，亦均被槍購一空，有關方面對此均深表焦灼，亟望解決。廿八日下午一時，資方代表南京人報利長張友　，與調人中宣部指導科長周以洞，曾往夫子廟狀元境陋巷中之集賢棧，與勞方代表磋商至深夜，勞方要求初為調整待遇，自十二月份起，增加百分之六十二，發年終雙薪。資方表示加薪司自明年元月份起，增加百分之四十，年終雙薪事以各報均賠累不堪，無力發給。後經調人揭出折衷意見，加薪可自十二月份開始，增加倍數希望雙方不必堅持，另求一折衷數字，至年終加發津貼一點，可不必定要雙薪名義，而由各報量力酌發若干。勞方當表示司考慮，惟對年終津貼之數目，要求平均發給每人二十萬元。資方代表以各報負担力量不同，未能即允，日當時已至廿九日晨間，縱可求得解決之途，廿九日亦不可能出報，乃無結果而散。廿九白晨，勞方乃於通衢要道散發傳單，說明彼等要求，籲請社會支援。十時，資方各報社負責人復集愈於中山東路上海飯店，商討對付辦法，決定由各報設法分別解決。下午四時，大剛報窗扇緊閉之門首已貼出「本報準於明日復刊」之祇條，其他各報亦均積極努力，於勞資雙方之會商，謀取妥協，直至傍晚，尙無必一致之結果。</p>

<h3>凌汛前的黃河</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者范世勤</p>
<p>治黃河眞不是一件易事，它好懺一個人痼疾經年，內　俱弛，外肢多僵，要是用輕　　無效，用重　就可慮。多少「名醫」為它束手，多少「良藥」為它失效。不要說為它治本，就是為它治標，可也不是簡單的事。</p>
<p>像現在花園口的堵口，僅使是將它下游引歸舊道，說不上治本。花園口在明年一月底，堵得了堵不了，還是一個謎。加之，最近路王墳的開石機又被共軍炸得粉碎，道石子在工程處正是像打仗的部隊需要子彈的時候，猛來一個「彈盡」的恐慌，看這赤手空拳的工松怎得了？這兩天，上游陝州巳經結了氷，眼等着氷塊就要下來，多大多密的木椿恐怕也難抵氷刀的銳鋒。這幾天花園口補打木樁的工程，確實很順利，這也許有人請來了孔明先生的幽靈，突然在這西北風猛發的季節中，刮上二三天的東南風，把口門的水勞殺了下去，木椿一一補了起來。我們現在可以假定石料還是有辦決，那共產黨搗蛋算不了什麽；當然也假定進元程可以功德圓滿如期元成，冰刀冰山的下來也不能把這二百二十多萬萬元的工程損傷毫末。　在這樣一個假定下，我們自然可以對新黃泛區放心。就是我們現在不必再管新黃泛區的賈魯河與沙河往年只有七八公尺，甚至能見河底的水深，現在巳經到了十四五公尺了；自然也不必擔心這樣的水深會浸坍了兩岸的堤防；周家口以北要出險的七華里長的地方，也用不到去　慮；至於將來一月間的凌汎時間，水塊會冲了過來，蓋至要爬上堤來，猛地的來殺搶險的工人，也是成為夢話；用不到搶救新黃泛區的堤防，省得去挖成塊的氷土來　堤，他省得去打偌大的木構來護堤。總之；一切都可以不必顧慮，也一切都可以免了，因為水巳經回它的老家去。</p>
<p>然而黃河滬個酒醉漢，扶得東來西又倒，扶得西來東又倒　　花園口堵口為土一堵成的話，據稅水位猛然在上游要提到二公尺。那末溫縣，孟縣就要首當其衝。溫縣的大堤從民國二十三年大水修了以後，到現在選沒有好好地修過一次。那裏有二十七公里的大堤，需要立刻修起來，否則河水已經高過平地一尺，大堤一決，溫縣立刻陸沉，孟縣的大堤，比較的結實，可是不去整理的話，那也抵不住高水位的衝激。有人顧慮。如果溫縣孟縣一帶出了亂子，那水就會奔到沁水去，由沁水又奔到衛河，一直可以席捲到天津，這塲禍　起來，可就不少。</p>
<p>住在黃河邊上吃黃河　魚，使人垂涎，可是不幸葬身在　魚腹裏，却也使人不可恕　的事。為了旁的事征工相當困難，如果要修黃河的堤的話，那老百姓就多會自吿奮勇，他們熱知黃河的大害，恐怕比什麽黃河專家還深，這一年整理黃河下游，這花園口堵口工程在內，經費是六百萬萬元。這數目好像很大，但除了堵口方面化去了二百多萬萬元以外，　下來給冀魯豫三省的，每省也不過一百多萬萬元。這樣看來，數目就不怎樣龐大，同時因為物價變動太大，預算　是超不上實際的需要，於是就有偷工减料的事情發生，比如像現在蘭考一帶所築的堤防，光是用沙土准成，將來水一過去，難免沒有危險。這個問題，倒也並不十分嚴重，因為只要再化一這大錢下去就行了；最感頣痛的是：在溫孟一帶，共軍飄忽不定。最近花園口堵復局派了一個工程隊去工作，在十天之內，照了三次荒，這怎麽能使工作進展自如？在中共實行大規模破壞政策之下，也可以說在政治沒有安定之下，來治黃河，總是處處進到困難。夏禹治水的成功，境內的安謐，很有關係。在他治水以節，舜巳經放了四凶族，太平得五千里內至於荒服。可是現在黃河成為人工製造的天災，這需要有政治而兼科學頭腦的工程專家來克復。</p>
<p>總之，結集在黃河上的問題可多：堵口不成，新黃汎泛區今年凌汎是個難關；堵成了，溫孟一帶又有出岔子的危險；而且要面面顧到，中共又隔在中間為難。聽說明年黃河鐵橋要重修，那末又將提高一二尺的水位，也是關心黃河的人所要關心的一點。</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>中暹關係的新頁</h3>
<p>暹羅首任駐華大使勝古安杜拉勒克於一昨雖見　主席，呈遞就任國書，並致辭曰：「中暹親睦，歷有年所，蓋以兩國間之具有種種密切之關係也。例如貴國人民僑寓敝邦，為數甚衆，安居樂業，世代相承，中暹人民之融洽無閩，於焉足徵。此種友善之關係，巳因最近締訂之中暹友好條約，而益瑧羣固。」我主席於接受暹羅大使所　國書後復致答辭，中有句云：「在第二次世界大戰中，日本侵略者之惡靑勢力，使書國人民備蒙痛苦，中國人民寶抱無限之同情，其所以然者，蓋適如閣下頃聞所言，中遇親陸，歷有年所，兩國之聞，實具有種種之密切關係也。敝國人民之僑居暹羅者，為數甚衆，安居樂業，世代相承，吾人至以為慰。且吾人深信由於中暹友好條約之締訂，貴我兩國之正式外交關係於焉建立，中暹兩民族間之友　，亦必因而增强也。」至此次暹羅大使的來華就任，實展開了中暹關係的新頁。茲當暹羅大使就任之初，願就中暹開係作一展望。</p>
<p>中暹為兄弟之邦，自古按娼頻繁，我僑胞之居留暹境者，為數甚衆：幾占暹羅全國人口三分之一，所以中暹關係一向很篤密切。自日寇企圖造成所謂「大東亞共榮圈」以來，日本即派遣第五縱隊在暹羅大施活動，一部分暹羅人士自覺或不自覺地中了日本宣傳的毒素。風氣所播，激起了狹隘的民族主義之抬頭，重定其國號日「泰」，慕擬希特勒「收回失地」的作風，對居留我西南邊區的夾族人民，特別是在襲南境內的一擺夷」，頭懷歸併凱視之忍，曾不斷有所煽動。自從過羅倡導所謂一大泰族」運動以來，中暹關係即處處有着增礁。因為有運種狹隘的民族主義的提倡，所以到了珍珠港事變一起，攀披汶之流，便刦特中樞，倒行逆施。凡此所為，我們深知與退羅人民的眞正　向相違。誠如我　主席答辭中所云，在第二次世界大戰中，日本侵略者之惡毒勢力，使暹羅人民備業痛苦，中國人民實抱無限的同情。</p>
<p>暹羅在世界第二次大戰後開始了它的新生。正在這個時候，中暹開始有正常外交關係的建立，這實在是一件令人欣慰的事。猶憶本年初，我國曾有訪暹代表團的派遣，在團長李鐵錚公使的領導下，訪問暹羅；其後又有中暹友好條約的簽訂，建立了中暹間正常外交關係的基礎，如今又有暹羅駐華大使的蒞任，凡此，均為中暹友好關係的表現。我國對亞洲各民族的態度，迭經我　主席昭吿於世，我們不但沒有侵略的野心，而且更願以兄長自居，得携亞洲各民族，共謀人類福利，特別是亞洲人民之福利的增進。中國與暹羅過去的關係旣甚密切，茲値復國新生，中暹關係因暹羅首任駐華大使的蒞任而展開新頁之際，如何發揚光大過去存在着的中暹兩民族的傳統睦誼，當為一般關心增進中暹關係的人所努力的鵠的。我們希望由於首任暹羅駐華大使的蒞任，中暹兩國間的關係，不諭是文化的，經濟的，或是商務的，能够更加緊密起來，此不僅關係中暹兩國的睦誼，實亦東服的繁榮與和平之所緊。</p>
<p>末了，我們於此僅祝暹羅駐華大使所負使命的成功，和大侵的旅居康泰！</p>
<h3>今後憲法的實施</h3>
<p>國民大會經過十五年的波折，居然召開，而且經過四十天會議，完成中華民國的憲法，並且決定由政府在卅六年一月一日正式實佈。卅六年十二月廿五日實施。這是中國民主政治，最重要的一個進展，也是自從辛亥革命推翻帝制以來，千萬烈士仁人拋擲熱血頭顱，所得到最大的代價。</p>
<p>就憲法本身而諭，常然不能算是十全十美，加像第一條「中華民國基於三民主義，為民治，民有，民享之民主共和國」，措詞即重複累賢，因總序中旣云「依據孫中山先生創立中華民國之遺敎……制定本憲法」，共為三民主義自不待言，旣標明「三民主義」當然即為民主共和國，旣云「民主共和國」則「民治，民有，民享」，又何必加入？不過在綜合審委會討論道一條約時候，各黨各派代表爭執甚烈。後經多數通過條改為「中華民國舊於三民主義之共和國」，民社及靑年兩黨漢致不滿，幾使制憲大會陷於價局，最後國民黨代表為顧全大局起見，重新複議，取消修正案維持原案，會塲空氣，方再變和諧。</p>
<p>又如國都問題，總統與行政院職務問題，立法院與國民代表大會權限問題，滿　回藏少數民放問題，均經過長期的辯論，最後通過修正的條文，無一不是互相讓步互相妥協約結果。本來此次國民代表大會，因為中共與一部民盟黨員未肯加入，國民黨代表人數比例因此增加，但是他們並沒有憑籍多數，意氣用事，處處以大公無私的精神，容忍合作的態度，對於少數黨及少數民族代表的意見，充分尊重容納。這次國民代表大會制憲成功。國民黨代表能够在蔣主席指導之下，曲意遷就，造成融洽的情緒，至少是最大原因之一。</p>
<p>這一部中華民國的憲法，難免不有許多的缺點，但是這些缺點正是中國各黨各派合作精神的表現。憲法貴在實施，沒有全國合作的精神作基礎，一部完美人的憲法也等於　紙。從民主基本原則方面來看，這一部憲法己經充滿了民主的精神，從中國各方面事實來看，這一部憲法，更是中華民族團結一致的表現。</p>
<p>所以我們不能够尋章摘句，來搜尋憲法的缺點，我們今後最大的責任，到是怎樣促進全國各黨各派的團結合作，使憲法眞正實施，奠定中國民主政治的基礎，展開建國的工作，解除民衆的倒懸。自從辛亥革命以來，內憂外患，紛至沓來，特別是抗戰八年，中國民衆的痛苦，已經到了最後的階段。他們恨極了內亂，也門厭卷了宣專，假如中國各黨各派的領袖，尙有天良，就應當早日棄甲釋兵，根據這一部憲法，與民更始，在他們私欲泯滅之時，也就是全國民衆諒解他們之日。</p>
<p>制憲工作巳吿成功，訓政階段，即吿結束，國民黨還政於民一切以國家為重的赤心，巳昭示於天下，現在中國各黨各派的領袖還有什麽理由，一定要稱兵割據，茶　生靈，使中國國民經濟趨於破產呢？現在全國有識之土，全國軍誌報章，都把中國一切的禍源，歸咎於戰爭，這自然是不可磨滅的眞理，然而有了國民代表大會不肯參加，有了憲法不肯合作實施，戰爭的責任，到底應常誰負？人民的眼睛是雪亮的，是非曲直早巳明隊，他們從今以後再不能支持任何分裂割據的週動了。</p>
<p>憲法完成，本來應當舉國屬歡，然而今天中國民衆的數樂上，却蒙上了一層的陰影。過去的美國，南北携乎，換得了一直到今天的和平當强，最近越南的獨立同盟和國民黨在大敵當前也冰釋據疑，組成聯合政府。這都是最好的榜樣，値得我們效法。現在中央政府仍然曲意遲就，再度圖謀和平，我們誠懇地希望，未曾參加制憲工作的各黨各派從速改變能度，减少憲法實施的因艱，滿足山國人民的希望。</p>

<h3>蘇北失學失業青年福音　青年軍招致青年</h3>
<p>— 揚州訊　本報特約記者王公瀚</p>
<p>招致的辦法</p>
<p>這裏是蘇北失學失業靑年的一個福音，蔣主席鑒於蘇北十年來，遭敵偽的蹂躪與共軍的遺書，災情莾重；失學失業的靑年，復為製可觀，持手令靑年軍第二〇二師，在徐州，南通，揚州，蚌埠這四個地方，設立「靑年招致站」，大量收容失學失業的胥年。其招致的辦法仍橡採「考取」式，惟具有高小程度者即司投考。年齡的規定是：十八歲至三十歲。這裏的「揚州招致站」，已成立了一個多星期，負責人為靑年軍第二〇二師工兵營少校到營長唐奇漢君。站址設在衛街靑年團江都分團部內。據唐君吿記者，上級規定他這一單位收容靑年的數字為公百人，預定一個月內完成。</p>
<p>招致的目的　關於招致的目的，據記者的觀測，可算純為救濟靑年與造就靑年；如果針對靑年的失學失業這一層上來說，則明明是為失學失業的肯年擺好一條就里就業的路。而且，這條路是一條「好出路」，是一般青年反不易獲得的。唐奇漢君在昨天（廿四日）的記者招待會上曾說：經過考試錄取的靑年，了以相當時期的軍事訓練和職業訓練後，即可照過去靑年軍退伍的待遇分別復員——升學或就業，並就此不再服兵役。</p>
<p>社會的誤解</p>
<p>但是，他們的工作在這裏才開始，這裏的社會上對於他們的工作却發生了一個誤解，誤解他們的工作是變象的徵兵。而這個情形在另外的三個地方—徐州，南通，蚌埠，不知道也有否？記者想：服兵役本是每個國民必盡的一種義務，然一般國人對服兵役一個是存畏懼心與逃避的態度却又是不可諱言的事實。但是，對於這次靑年軍的招致可年，國人如對牠誤解了，實在是失學失業靑年自己的損失，因為，據記者的了解：這是失學失榮靑年不易再有的被救濟被造就的一個機會。當局之所以有道」舉措，純粹為愛護靑年假定有人認為當局道一舉措是變象的徽兵，記者却以為：實在恐怕還是當局為失學失業的知識靑年特地設想出來的一稱優待辦理哩。因為，我們知道：慢慢的，誰都得服兵役的。　下而，記者願將靑年軍的史實，介紹給關心的讀者。</p>
<p>青年軍史實</p>
<p>三十三年十月，中原戰爭發生，敵蹄的兇燄，長驅深入，在湘桂失陷時，蔣主席為了最後勝利與將來建國的需要，乃振臂一呼，號召十萬知識靑年從軍。當時全國活力充沛熱血沸騰的靑年，從各個角落跑出來，紛紛報名入伍，百川匯海似的擠進了軍營，不到兩個月　十萬的數字巳過了額。次年（卅四年）春，靑年軍就成立了，時計有九個師，其番號與駐紮的地點為：二〇一師在四川壁山，二〇二師在四川莾江，二〇三師在四川瀘縣，二〇四師在四川萬縣，二〇五師在貴州貴陽，一〇六師在陝西漢中，二〇七師在靈南昆明，二〇八師在江西，二〇九師在福建。實施訓練便從是年二月份開始。</p>
<p>組成的份子</p>
<p>不用說了，這十萬靑年軍的組成份子是相當複雜的，有小學生；也有大學敎授；有小學敎師；也有私塾生。有工廠技工；也有體關職員。有金融交通界人員，也有鄉村自治的工作人員。他如達官顯宦的子弟，當商碩賈的子孫等等，均皆有之。但是，入營後的靑年軍，在各級幹部「善撫」，「嚴繩」，「動敎」之下，建立紀律，安定生活，不到半年的時間，已經是一支相當勁練的軍隊。</p>
<p>軍中的生活</p>
<p>關於他們的生活，吃的方面是一天三餐，食料都是富有營義的。如：早餐菜是黃豆與花生米，午餐菜是魚肉和蔬菜，晚餐與午餐同。敎育方面，初入伍時是新兵敎育，繼而軍士敎育，再即受軍官敎育。而在精神敎育與政治訓練方面，特別注重軍隊國家化意識之養成。管理方面，為盡量要求自治，與提高他們自動學習的情緒，及廢除體罰。訓練科別方面，有操塲，有講堂。娛樂方面，花樣特多：有話劇，平劇，川劇，普樂，舞蹈，馬劇，雜要。另外，侮星期還有一次晚會。</p>
<p>復員的情形　三十四年八月中浣，日寇撫條件投降了，政府為顧念大多數從軍學生的學業，決定靑年軍自三十四年十二月起至三十五年五月底以前，完成預備軍官敎育，六月間則開始退伍。</p>
<p>三十五年五月底，政府便將靑年軍復員的交通工具準備齊全了，於是，六月一日，實行靑年軍復員，汽車，火車，繪船，把復員的靑年們送達每一個中心區域，然後再按照各個靑年尙須前進的旅程發給法定的旅費。與這同時，政府並保障復員胥年的學業與職業。臂如：科學方面：高中畢業者可免試，由敎育部分發國立各大學深造。初由進入高中，高小升入初中，都與高中升大學一樣的優待。另外，並成立大學先修班三所，靑年中學八所，復業方面，除保障原任何業者仍復何業、並另設職業訓練班六所，內分電訊，交通，農林，會計，師資等科。</p>
<p>目前的狀况</p>
<p>國防部成立後，政府為了管理的便利，在國防部機構中，特设一預備幹部管訓處，專司其事。由蔣經國負責生持。現各地都已成立了分處及通訊站。同時胥年軍由九個師整編為六個師，即二〇二師，二〇三師，二〇五師，二〇六師，二〇七師，二〇八師，現分駐於吳縣，重慶，衡陽，洛陽，瀋陽，北平等處，從事準備明年高中學生的集訓工作。</p>

<h3>蘇聯又一新行動　主張在三個月內　草就裁軍總計劃　此舉旨在爭取主動權</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約成功湖廿八日電〕蘇聯已提出新建議，主張在三個月內草具完備之裁軍計劃，包括由國際管制原子，彈及其他可怖武器之詳細方案。安全理事會之蘇聯代表葛羅米哥，頃致函聯合國秘書長賴依，將該案提交安全理事會下星期二之會議討論。該案規定由安理會立即設特別委員會，以實行全體大會最近通過之裁軍計劃中之實際措施，並於一至二月至遲不逾三月之期間內，提出有關該計劃之建議。關係方面認蘇聯此一新動議，意在取得主動，推進早日裁軍。按在聯合國全體大會中首先提出裁軍案者，即爲蘇外長莫洛托夫，經過長久之討論後，聯大卒於十二月十四日通過歷史性的裁軍決議案，責成安全理事會，草具國際裁軍公約，並建立特種機構，以管制原子能火箭及其他一切具有集團破壞力之武器。葛羅米哥之新決議，力言安理曾除實行聯大之計劃外，並應設立確保裁减軍備及軍隊之國際管制。按美國之原子能國際管制方案，已定於星期一由安全理事會罰論。若干非正式觀察家認爲蘇聯此一新決議案，意在分散安理會對美國原子能案之注意。復料原子能委員會於星期一開會討論向週一安理會所提之報吿書時，葛羅米哥或當宣布蘇聯之接受該報吿書，惟同時則將蘭明附帶若干保留，以期迅速進入普遍裁軍談判之階段。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿八日電〕蒙帥擬至莫斯科訪問一事，此間報章多表歡迎，認爲可以緩和英蘇兩國間之緊張關係。消息靈通人士並謂；蒙帥此行或將與蘇聯領袖討論普遍裁軍。軍事佔領德國。及加速撤退敵國境內之盟軍等問題。但英陸軍部人士對此，則拒木加以評論。</p>

<h3>力圖東山再起的　邱吉爾</h3>
<p>據法國新聞社紐約廿七日電，英國前首相邱吉爾本日在「柯里爾」雜誌上以「走向將來之大道」爲題，發表一文，再論「組織歐洲合衆國」的必要。該文內容要點，已見昨日各報，無庸贅述。但是有一點是値得一提的，就是邱吉爾雖已不再是當今英國的執政者，而退居反對黨領袖的地位，但以其戰時領袖的威望，他的一言一語依然爲全世界忦注目，儼然仍爲政治思想界的一大重鎭。</p>
<p>猶憶一年多前英國舉行普遍無普選，勞工黨以壓倒優勢，制服邱吉爾以及他領導的保守黨時，英國的政治家都以爲邱吉爾的政治生活的要就此「壽終正寢」了。</p>
<p>然而事實不然。邱吉爾依然是保守黨的領袖，在英國政治上依然具有相當大的力量。當他僕僕風塵于歐美兩大陸上，到處發表演說的時候，民衆均報以熱烈的歡迎，一點也沒有因在政海遭過打擊而顯出頹喪的神氣。</p>
<p>三大題目</p>
<p>邱吉爾自從首相缷任以來，對於國際政治依然十分注意‘從他許多次演說中，可以看出他極端重視三大題目；（一）蘇聯和共產主義所爭取的目標，具有危險性；（二）必須組織歐洲合衆國，藉以復興舊世界；（三）英美繼續密切合作的重要。</p>
<p>今年三月間，邱吉爾在福爾頓發表的「鐵幕」演說，曾在國際間引起軒然大波。蘇聯的批評非常尖刻，史達林甚至說他是「煽動戰爭者」認爲他的目的是在宣揚英語民族制霸世界的思想。邱吉爾這一篇演說，曾使英美兩國處於窘境，而不得不竭力表明邱吉爾所發表的祇是他個人的見解，並非當局的主張。但是邱吉爾却堅持他自己的意見，他說：「幾年之後，我想你們會同意我所說的話是應該說的」。</p>
<p>至於「組織歐洲合衆國」的主張，所引起的反響不若前者之强烈。今年，他曾分赴法國二比利時，盧森堡和荷蘭路國，鼓其如簧之舌向衆演說，但結果並未引起熱烈的反映。但是反映雖少，邱吉爾本人却堅持其主張，不稍變更。</p>
<p>內政問題</p>
<p>邱吉爾對於英國內政問題，也攻擊不遣餘力。他以保守黨領袖的地位，竭力指責勞工政府的政策，認爲現政府所推行的收歸國有計劃，勢將招致嚴重的後果，同時對於勞工黨處理英帝國當前各大問題的態度，深表驚慌，以爲帝國機構，將發生嚴重的動搖。</p>
<p>一般人認爲邱吉爾有關內政問題的各次演說，內容比較貧庸，不及他在担任戰時首相時所發表演說之精采動人。保守黨中一部份比較靑年份子，或有認爲邱吉爾過份保守，對於該黨的重掌政權反足以招致障碼的。但當十月初保守黨在黑池召開大會時，邱吉爾在黨內的領導地位，未風動搖，反有益臻鞏固之勢。</p>
<p>自從邱吉爾在競選中失敗以來，各方對他的指摘是很多的，這種批評大多來自克里姆宮和保守黨的左冀份子方面。有人說他在亞洲戰塲方面曾經採取短視的策略，以求不勞而獲；也有人說他在歐洲戰塲方面曾經反對過盟軍收效極宏的戰略。議會某委員會曾說戰時英國坦克大砲生產减少，一度造成危急的局勢，邱吉爾應尸其咎。至於埃利沃，羅斯福，則在他的一本近著中直截稱呼邱吉爾爲反動的頑固份子。</p>
<p>民間感情</p>
<p>在英爾國內，民衆對他感情不差，但在投票時却反對他的政策和他領導的政黨。例如瑪蓋脫的民衆在普選時投票贊成勞工黨，可是其後復建議在杜佛山壁上建立邱吉爾的銅像一座，口中啣着一枝巨大的雪茄。夜間船隻行經該處，仰首可以望見雪茄頭上微微的紅光。　邱吉爾吸過的雪茄烟蒂，收藏家已視爲珍品。今夏邱吉爾赴挪威時，他所投下的烟蒂，在海牙和阿姆斯特丹的市塲上，銷路極好，價値高達九十五基爾特，折合美金三十五元。</p>
<p>政海浮沉</p>
<p>政海的浮沉，各方的讚揚或責難，對於邱吉爾是極平常的事，在他七十二歲的生命中，經歷實在太多了。他在一八九九年首次參加競選，慘遭失敗。第一次世界大戰期間身居海相要聯，旋因韃靼尼爾一役慘敗，不得不於一九」五年提出辭呈。戰後，他想重入下院，失敗兩次，但最後終獲成功。第二次世界大戰爆發後，他再度出任海相，而於一九四〇年奉英皇之命擔任首相之職，終於把英國從失敗的邊緣上挽救了過來。這些，都是人所共知的，且已成爲歷史的一部份了。</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰結束，勝利來臨，邱吉爾以戰時領袖的威望參加競選，結果竟敗於勞工黨之手，此點實出世人意料之外，但是邱吉爾的「的翰牛」精神，並未因失敗而稍見衰落。今後如何，不妨拭目以待。</p>

<h3>美國對朝鮮政策　在使朝鮮</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿八日電〕國務院長官兩人今日以「吾國外交政策」爲題，發表廣播演說。兩氏』爲該院日本與朝鮮經濟司長馬丁，另一爲日本司長鮑頓。演說宗旨在闡明美國對朝鮮所採取之政策，在使朝鮮獨立與完全統一。鮑頓稱：「吾人迄未能與蘇聯遵盾四國外長會議於一年前所奠定之途徑，獲致任何進展。職是之故，吾人現正依照美國佔領區之計劃，單獨行事。」兩氏均認爲朝鮮復興，當前困難重重，因朝鮮主要工業均在蘇聯佔領區內。本年秋收又復欠佳　馬丁稱：「中國可能成爲朝鮮之大主顧，但朝鮮出口貨數量恐不致過大。」鮑頓則謂：「美國爲本身並爲朝鮮利益起見，應援助朝鮮，良以民主繁榮與友善之朝鮮，將爲遠東之重要穩定因素，而和平之遠東，乃美國外交政策之最重要目標也。美國在朝鮮之敎育計劃，政治發展及南部之自給自足各方面，均曾加以協助。劃分朝鮮南北二佔領區之壁壘一旦消除以後，則美國佔領區依照目下計劃所進行之工作，決不致阻止朝鮮社會經濟與政治生活之迅速統一。美蘇雙方於一年前舉行會議，以謀制定朝群獨立之種種擋優，但計劃全然失敗，美過失不盡在吾方，亦不盡在蘇方。吾人準備隨時與蘇聯恢復會議，依照莫斯科協定，制定可以接受之方式，以朝鮮交還朝鮮人」。</p>
<p>或問中英兩國曾共同簽署開羅宣言，該兩國何以不在朝鮮担任佔領任務乎？關於此點，鮑頓力言，關於朝鮮獨立與統一之各項措施，正由美蘇雙方草擬中，一俟適當時機，即當提出其他國家批准云。</p>
<p>蘇報評論</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿九日電〕蘇聯記者史摩倫斯基　在「史達林斯克報」撰文，抨擊美國對朝鮮之佔領政策。略謂：一九四五年莫斯科外長會議決定在朝　沒立臨時民主政府，朝鮮人聞之　　，但美國當局對此方向，並無作爲。美國人不過取日本之地位而代之，對於朝鮮農災之命運並未改變。農業改組爲朝鮮之重大問題，百分之六十耕地，仍屬於少數大地主階級及新設立之美鮮合股公司。日本之法規仍然有效，大大衆之命運日見惡劣。一九四五年九月與十月間一連串嚴重之罷工已顯示對美國人之不滿，在若干塲合，此種罷工旋於武力叛變。朝鮮人民渴待設立眞正的民主政府，爲其利益效力。此種政府惟有在正確並完全實施莫斯科會議決議時，始能成立云。</p>

<p>中央新訂之調整辦法中，已將生活倍數由七二〇倍拉高至一一〇〇倍，津貼基本數則自十一萬提高至十七萬。如是，則公務員調整後之薪水約較前增加百分之六十弱，然此係一般之平均數，嚴格計之，底薪愈大者，增加成數愈少，底薪愈小者，增加成數較大。</p>
<p>茲據記者探悉：市府所屆各局處之各級公務員，經調整其待遇後，平均可得之薪金數目如下：</p>
<p>吳市長底薪為六八〇元，原支薪金約六十萬元，調整後每月可得九十一萬八千元。</p>
<p>局長及處長之底薪，視其資歷略有上下，平均約爲五百元，原支薪金四十七萬元，調整後每月可得七十二萬元。</p>
<p>科長之底薪亦各有差別，平均約爲二百元，原支薪金二十五萬四千元，調整後每月可得三十九萬元。</p>
<p>科員中，底薪最低者為七十五元，原支薪金僅十六萬四千元，調整後每月爲二十五萬二千五百元。</p>
<p>警員之待遇，照中央規定之原則，其津貼之基本數十七萬，尚須以六折計算，即爲十萬零二千元，未經調整前，警士之待遇，平均約為十萬元左右，調整之後，約得薪金十四五萬元左右。</p>
<p>至於在調整令未公佈前，吳市長所允撥借之薪金半月，於待遇調整以後，尚須分期扣還，如何分期，則有待市府當局之決定。</p>
<h3>滬太汽車公司　各綫恢復通車</h3>
<p>滬太長途汽車公司戰前所行駛之上海至羅店瀏河寨定以及吳漱至賓山楊行月浦羅店簽各綫，定於三十六年一月一日起，全部通車，總公司及上海車站同時遷回閘北鳥鎮路光復路二三五號原址，發售客票。現因爲鎮路橋在戰時拆除，故乘客須由新閘橋北堍往東或新圾垃北堍往西，均可直達。</p>
<h3>元旦慶祝大會　更改名稱</h3>
<p>本市各界慶祝元旦大會，開將遵照中央正式指示，改為「上海市各界慶祝中華民國憲法成立暨開國卅六年紀念大會」，並定於今晨十時，在市業部召開正副組長會議，商討加緊進行。本市黨政首長將親自出席指導。</p>
<h3>各業年賞總數　當在五百億上</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕有地位之商界人士表示：今年之年終獎勵金，因地方當局能事先訂出標準，使此問題之嚴生性，爲之減輕不少。雖有若干廠商，因獲利甚多而致年賞遠過於市府所規定者，但此乃出於自願，且亦限於少數人員。據一般估計，本市各業所發出之年賞總數，當在五百億元以上。</p>
<h3>廠商聯誼會成立　國貨商場昨復業</h3>
<p>國貨展覽商場廠商聯誼會，爲互相切磋共謀發展，經籌組廠商聯誼會，已於昨日上午在該場大禮堂舉行成立會，計到有全國商會總會理事長王曉籟，中國生產促進會總會理事長毛慶祥，及全體廠商二百餘人，由胡伯翔主席，通過章程選舉委員，並全體攝影散會。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕國貨展覽商場，因新成分局派便警於二十七日下午一時向該場上海絨綫公司車取貨物，發生糾紛，致全體廠商停業，昨晨該場全體廠商會議，公推胡伯翔主席，同時歡迎中國生產促進會理事長毛慶祥塈全國商聯會理事長王曉籟，經主席會同毛王兩氏並商場負責人張子廉毛聖棟蔣仲和倪翰如盛公恕一再解釋勸導，己決議立即開市復業，並推舉代表辦理交涉。</p>
<p>〔另訊〕上海絨線公司經副理王敬之葉震，旬日前向鴻大等十二絨線號收購絨線三千七百餘磅，價值一萬萬五千餘萬元，當時均以行荘支票成交，豈知到期均遭退票，而該公司已宣告清理，各被害人即聯名呈報新成分局，會同警員前往國貨商場認看被騙貨物，以致發生糾紛。昨日下午被騙商號特在大西洋西菜社招待各報記者，報告經過。</p>
<h3>中央航空公司　追悼罹難人員</h3>
<p>中央航空公司昨假中央殯儀館，舉行罹難職員追悼大會。禮堂正中安放正機師陳瑞榮，副機師農臨泝，實習機師錢定武，電訊員林大華等四人之棺柩，前放靈台，花圈數十個，以半圓形排列靈前。貧兒教養院之樂隊奏衰樂。追悼會於下午四時開始，由陳總經理主祭，陳主任，鄧副主任陪祭，上香祭奠後，即由陳總經理致辭，對死難職員，深致衰悼，並慰勉此次因失事而辛苦之各位同仁。會後記者趨詢陳總經理，叩以關於地檢處將依法起訴事，據稱，飛機失事後二十四小時內，即電呈主管機關報告一切，非敢隱瞞，如地檢處認爲公司方面有漏報地檢處或因此而必予追究或起訴，公司方面當依法應傳出庭，決不推諉，現僅見報戰，地檢處尚未正式公事到來。</p>

<h3>從三機失事　檢討　改善　設施　天氣和飛行有密切聯繫　盲目降落設備必不可少</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕航空史上飛機失事的往例，屢見不鮮，但像最近這次在一天之內—準確說來是在幾小時之內，在一地上空，連續發生三架客機失事墜毀，死傷八十餘人的慘劇，則還是破天荒的一頁，加之失事的當天，又正是救主降生的誔日，無怪乎消息所播，社會爲之震驚，與論爲之沸騰，而近自中樞，遠及國外，對於此事無不深切注意，並且一致的認爲民航前途，應該來一番澈底的檢討和改進。</p>
<p>記者曾就手頭資料所及，把抗戰勝利以來歷次飛機的失事，作一次簡略的統計，如下表所下：</p>
<p>失事日期　失事機名　失事地點　死傷人數</p>
<p>三月十七日　戴苙軍專機　南京附近</p>
<p>三月十九日　中國公司一三九號渝滬班機　漢口金鎮　三十人</p>
<p>四月八日　中共葉挺王若飛等專機　西安附近　十二人</p>
<p>七月十二日　中央公司滬平十五號班機　濟南附近　五五人</p>
<p>九月二十日　中國公司八十一號康渝班機　西昌附近　二十人</p>
<p>十二月十四日　中央公司三十一號平滬班機　浙江長興　六人</p>
<p>十二月十四日　中國公司六十七號京滬班機　龍華機場　無</p>
<p>十二月廿五日　中國公司一四〇號渝滬班機　龍華機場　三十人</p>
<p>十二月廿五日　中國公司一一五號渝滬班機　本市近郊　四十人</p>
<p>十二月廿五日　中央公司四十八號渝滬班機　江灣附近　十一人</p>
<p>上列各機的失事原因，事實上不會這樣簡單，並且也不容易絕對的確定，因爲僅僅根據事後的調查察勘所推斷的結果，與真正的事實，多少總有一些距離。但是，正像一般史學家常以天時地利人和三點來衡量一切世事的成敗，我們研究飛機失事的原因，也不出乎（一）天氣的變化，（二）機場設備的不夠，（三）航空人員的過失以及（四）飛機本身的障碍。記者曾就這幾個問題訪問過幾位專家，所得的結論是凡此困難，都是可以克服的。</p>
<p>天機若能預測，勝算自可必操　首先從氣候來講，所謂天有不測風雲，在目前科學還不能完全發展到「天定勝天」的時代，氣候的阻碍諸如濃霧·高空結冰·急雨暴風等等，常爲造成飛機失事的主要原因，所有這些自然現象的阻礙似乎比較難以克服，但至少爲什麼不能從消極的預測和避免上努力呢？上次中央機在長興失事以後本市中央氣象台的陳台長曾經偶然與記者談起，他說如果把飛機失事的損失，用來加強氣象預測的工作，必能使失事的可能性減到極低。他的話頗有至理，航空界與氣象界亟須密切聯繫。就現在的國內飛行而論，大都祇是在起飛的時候用無綫電詢問一下終點站的氣候情形，對於數小時以後可能發生的變化，以及沿途其他各地上空的氣候情形，可以說完全茫無所知，這一種近於盲目的飛行怎麼不危險？如果氣象工作能夠做得好，除了在起迄兩地設立氣象台外，每條航綫所經之處，每隔若干距離都應設置氣象測候所，這些大大小小的氣象台和氣象測候所，每隔相當時間，報告一次當地的氣候，並與全國其他各地取得聯絡，隨時預測氣候可能的變化，則可飛的飛，不能飛的停飛，天機預洩，勝算可操，再配合其他因素的健全，飛機失事的消息，恐將絕跡於我人之耳了。</p>
<p>各處小型機場　亟須多加開闢　其次談到機場設備，可以分兩方面來講：一是機場本身的方位大小和優劣，以要市龍華機場而言，黃浦江密邇在側，冬季多霧，近水處尤多，對於飛機降落極爲適宜，而軌道尤嫌狹小路面亦已凹凸不平，雨天積水成窪,凡此種種都夠不上稱爲一個現代化的機場。且全上海民用機場僅此一處，其負担之重尤爲不合理的現象。同時在每條航綫的中途，更需多關幾處小型機場，俾萬一中途發生突變或障礙時可以有救急之處。二是機場降落和通訊的機械設備，尤其是利用雷達的盲目降落設備更是必不可少，這些都已有人屢次提出，並且認爲是刻不容緩的事了。</p>
<p>飛行人員生活　絕對不能踰規　至於飛機本身的障礙除了有些逾齡的舊機決不可爲生意眼着想而勉強使用外，與飛行人員的技術有着密切的關係。駕駛技術的優良固然不是一朝一夕間所能成就，但事前的檢查準備必須絕對的精密謹慎。記者特別認爲凡是負責公共安全的工作人員，在每次飛行的時候，他們的私生活不能有逾規的情形。記者前在黔桂時曾碰到一次覆車，其原因就是爲司機在前一天晚上一夜嫖妓，因此第二天精神恍惚所致。飛機駕駛員的任務比汽車司機更爲艱巨，我們能夠想像一個飲酒過度或急於想趕到目的地狂歡作樂的機師所可能發生的危險嗎？</p>
<p>美國航空管理　足供借鏡參考　民用航空的管理，也是非常重要的事，以航空先進的美國來說，政府在前務部之下設有兩個專管民用航空的機構。一是民用航空局，它近乎一個決策機構，可不受商務部之牽制，其任務為安全標準及航空規則之訂定，各種執照之發給及吊銷，航空稅之收取，客運貨運及航寄郵件價目之規定，民營航業間競爭聯緊之處置等等。此外並負責訂立有關失事章則，調查公佈失事情形，及防止再度發生以減少失事次數。另一執行機構為民用航空管理處，處長受商務部長之指揮，負責發展國內航空綫飛機場及其他設備，包括設計建築指揮保護等等。此外並担任各種航空技術之研究改良，並根據航空局所定規章可作緊急吊銷安全執照之措置，對於違犯航空規章者，則有權處以罰款。上述兩管理機構的組織及任務，很可以供我國即將成立的交通部民用航空局的參考。</p>
<p>不幸事件已經過去，死的已死，傷的也已傷了。所能希望的，但願當局在辦理善後之餘，切切實實的從事改革，使這一次慘痛的教訓，促成中國民航事業的新紀元，那末死者泉下有知，也可以瞑目了。</p>

<h3>中航一四〇號乘客之一　李芳經帶有巨款　墜機後追索無從　同鄉沈裕民來滬收殮　對行李散失極表悲憤</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央黨史史料編簒委員會編輯處處長沈裕民君昨至本報館聲稱：此次失事中航一四〇號機內之第宅李芳經，廣東人，係西南聯大教育系畢業，任教於清華中學，南開中學，及四川教育學院。本年考取自費留學，已與美國康乃爾大學研究院洽妥，至該院研究。惟李君家境清貧，資斧困難，乃由其親友同學酬資相助，沈處長因與李同鄉，代向正在首都開會之國大在華僑代表馮君商借，馮代表因李君僅短少二百萬元，慨然允諾，並表示願於離京前能與李君一晤，於是李君遂捆行裝，欣然飛京，不意慘遭此刦，死於非命！沈處長聞悉噩耗後，即遄道來滬，為李成殮。惟昨日趕至龍華機場，則辦事人員大多不在，乘客行李更所餘無幾．經多方探詢，始知中國航空公司雖值此震驚中外之非常事件，而昨日星期竟例假如舊，故即欲認領遺物，亦已無人接洽。沈氏因該機係臨於機場以內，乘客行李不應散失，而李君此來，隨身實有友人托帶巨款，至此追覓無從，尤為悲憤，並稱各罹難乘客親屬應即聯合追究責任，尤望地院從嚴檢舉，以慰死者而策將來之安全。</p>
<h3>象牙烟槍白玉鑲　兩烟窟設備富麗　偵查一星期　捕獲十八人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕一週前老閘警局得報，謂浙江北路慈德里四號有人私設烟館，供人吸毒，當經施分局長勸蔣股長派員偵查，歷一星期之久，悉該號進出門戶計有四處之多，不易破獲，乃派員化裝水菓販，至該弄內查明路徑後，至二十八日下午十時三三十分，派股員張國棟率領警長陳鈞幹·王從周·幹警李駿坤·崔子良·翁耀·白海山·楊中明·杜國珍等化裝馳往，預令數人隔戶翻上屋頂，攀守於窗口，其餘人員從各門同時擁入。其時有吸客十五名，正在三樓及屋頂攔樓等處吞雲吐霧，觀見警員到來，一部份擬越窗而逃，但已來不及，全部被獲。</p>
<p>計烟管主及烟客金在容，（卅三歲太倉人）楊陳阿小，（四十七歲寶山人，上兩人均住慈德里四號）賈如喜（四十六歲楊州人住福建路二五〇號）韓景坡，（卅四歲楊州人住同上）傅同康，（四十三歲蘇州人住廣東路悅來南貨號）吳風池，（卅七歲河北人住廣東路承吉里十三號）荘永高，（五十歲南京人住浙江北路慈德里四號）薛建秋，（四十五歲安徽人住古拔路一五五號）陸林白，（卅八歲上海人住惠民路人壽里一五六號）王守紅，（卅歲住西門路永德里二號）楊陳氏，（五十三歲質山人）韓陳氏，（卅二歲楊州人）徐元昌，（卅七歲寗波人）孫光濤，（卅一歲常州人）黃德明，（四十四歲以上五名均住慈德里四號）。當場查獲象牙白玉鑲烟槍三支，烟燈二只，正在熬煮烟膏二銅鍋。在夾牆內抄出馬牌克羅米手槍一支，號碼為七五〇一〇號，無執照，全部人證一併帶回分局，經嚴密偵查，據主犯金在容供，所有烟土，均向浙江南路寶裕里七號三樓韓玉明處購來，由今年二月間起，每次交易烟土十兩廿兩不等，查其往來支票簿，已達一千二百十七萬八千元，現紗無從統計。乃復押同金犯至上述地點。先由張股員四週佈置，嗣派幹警兩名從隔鄰翻過屋面，張由後門叩門，久久無應，其時韓已知失風，正在內燬減物證，約半時後，始啟門，於是各警員　擁而入。該屋係三上三下房至，約有房間十餘間，均有套房，內有三人正在吸烟。遂將韓拘獲，在其皮鞋內搜出烟土一方。其妻韓施秀如（卅二歲天津人）雖承認販毒，惟否認家中尚有其他烟土。最後在三樓床邊發現一秘密邊門，推門而入，則係一四層擱樓，滿堆家用器具，又搜查良久，卒又抄得烟土一大塊，重逾十兩，並有烟槍烟燈等物，乃連同其姪韓繼領（十八歲天津人）及吸客三名一併拘局，申請地檢處羈押十天，俾繼續偵查。</p>

<h3>區長李柏青　被押說不確</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日報載本市十六區區長李柏青之妻高葩蓮，被控印製「青年訓導團」名義封條，查封南華新邨青華小學新聞一則，記者昨於某要人處親晤李君，談及是項消息，據告十六區境內並無所謂南華新邨，亦無書寫對條由其妻蓋用區印查封小學之事，至還押之說，尤其不確。因記者親晤其人，足證並無還押之事，當係傳述之誤云。</p>
<h3>法商洋行失竊美金　未留指紋偵查困難</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市虎邱路一四七號四十七號室法商新登洋行，昨晨被小偷光顧，損失美金二千二百元。當時寫字間門及抽屉均被撬開，惟竊賊竟絲毫未留指紋。該案最早發覺者，係該行經理法人許東（年廿六歲），其時已在昨晟十時，故黃浦警分局接獲報告派員調查時，甚難覺得綫索，目前尚未能有所發展。</p>
<h3>蛇為膜拜對象　捕魚不需罟綱　高山族風俗詭異　斬下首級置台土炫耀　連杯飲血酒算是知交</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕台灣高山族土俗展覽會，在大新公司二樓舉行，記者曾作一次走馬看花的巡禮。</p>
<p>從這許多陳列的照片和展品之中，可以看山高山族生活的大概輪廓那真是近乎原始的一種生活，跟美國影片裏的土人生活，多少有些相像。高山族在宗教上，屬於一元神教，而且是拜物教。蛇是他們的「圖騰」，膜拜的對象。展品中就有一雙五百年前的蛇　。此外還有許多象形的雕刻，也都是以蛇為藍本。土族的頭目，自有他的權威，然而他的權威還在神權之下。頭目和他的族民集合，往往只穿一條短裙，然而他有一條珠光寶氣的「貝錬」表明他的身份。他有時還穿一件小貝壳的衣服，在婚裏戰首等大典時，顯示莊嚴和隆重。小貝壳只有一粒細嫩的真珠米大，穿製以後，就像一條粗鬆的白絨綫。他們還把外來的鈕扣，圖案式的釘在衣服上，這真是鈕扣的妙用。</p>
<p>他們的住宅，都是用短木撐搭的茅屋，非常簡陋，他們也有織機和穀倉，每年農事完畢後，要舉行大典。除掉農作物以外，他們的主要食品，有魚類和野獸。他們捕魚不用魚網，而用木叉和鐵叉。這一類魚叉只有三多長，全憑技術的熟練和準確。捕獸也用各種長槍和弓矢。其實，他們戰爭時所用的武器，也不外這些，只是製造得比較精巧。鋒利的長矛，彎曲的刀劍，帶有回刃的刺槍等等，充分表現高山族殺伐與尚武的精神。搏鬥之後，斬下來的人頭，放在首級臺上，算是一種光榮的炫耀。</p>
<p>這兒有一件奇異的東西，名為連杯，兩雙長杯連在一起，它的用途有三：（一）　首時，用連杯盛血和酒喝飲，算是被斬者的知交。（二）頭目爲人排難解紛，兩造用連杯同飲，以釋嫌隙。（三）夫婦飲合　酒之用。</p>
<p>在藝術上，他們也並非毫無成就，有硬木雕成的鹿頭匙，和各種雕刻精細的祭盤。他們的陶器，烟斗，和藥　，也別具風格。還有一具古代英雄的塑像，全身赤裸，看着也還英俊。</p>
<p>他們在藝術上，雖沒有達到圓熟之境，然而一種燦爛才華，却可以從粗廣淳朴中表現出來。</p>
<h3>羅卓英談　粵省政情　糧食已不缺交通漸恢復　絲業發展有前途</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕廣東省政府主席羅卓英，昨日上午由京來滬，於下午三時出席廣東旅滬同鄉歡迎茶會，席間暢談廣東近情。對復員以來之廣東治安，糧食，交通，及經濟情形有所報告。</p>
<p>羅氏稱：勝利之後，廣東之敵偽奸匪，遊雜部隊達十餘萬人，當局不斷予以掃蕩，收編，安置，遣散，直至今天四月，始逐漸安定下來，目前廣東治安絕無問題，僅香港九龍附近，尚有小股流匪。</p>
<p>至於食糧，廣東向來不足，本年四月底米價曾突破十萬元大關，幸賴　羅安南華僑之採運，中央之救濟，京滬廣東同鄉之協助，米價始漸回跌，民心趨於安定。同時廣東省政府實施全面生產，全而節約，全面購運，全面管制政策，頗獲成效。今年廣東食米已無問題。目前正積極設法解救明年三·四·五·六月之荒月問題。</p>
<p>交通方面，各江水路已通，唯船隻不足。戰前鐵路，粵漢及廣九皆已恢復通車。公路現由省府交歸民營，並予以保障及獎勵，已有華僑投資興築。</p>
<p>關於經濟，廣東絲業極有前途，據專家視察後稱：較江浙兩省更有希望。省府已定五年經濟計劃，唯缺乏資本，極盼各界踴躍投資，勿錯過建設廣東之好機會。蓋廣東生產發達，即可開關南洋市場，對我國經濟前途，關係殊為密切。</p>
<h3>青年軍二〇二師　來滬係覓址訓練</h3>

<p>音樂和女人，是大都會中不可少的點綴品，跳舞是音樂和女人的綜合物，在上海的娛樂圈內，、佔着很大勢力。舞蹈本爲人類文明最早的產物，任何民族在神權時代，舞蹈是敬神祭祖時的一種重要節目。但在現階段的上海，舞蹈已經變了質。在半明平暗的燈光之下，擁抱着裝扮得像妖魔似的女人，再加上洋洋大觀的爵士音樂，已成爲金錢和色慾的賣置。與過去含有藝術性的舞蹈，相去天壤了。</p>
<p>聖誕節纔過去，新年將到，這正是跳舞的令節。都市之夜本來是不寂寞的，這幾天格外顯得熱鬧，雖然霓虹燈已被禁止了，但到處仍有許多誘惑的燈光，隨時向路旁的行人招手。一陣陣的音樂，在凜冽的寒風中，吹送過來。假如你已控制不住自己情感的話，踏進了舞塲的大門，那更可以看到動人的一幕。一對對的舞侶，在舞池中廻旋，各種樂器交奏而成「夜之曲」，撩亂了人的心弦，在這裏，充滿了享樂者的狂笑。</p>
<h3>上海舞場回顧</h3>
<p>跳舞的風氣，在今日上海，已普遍地流行着，上自達官鉅賈，下至薪水階級，尤其是學生之流，都留迎於舞塲塲之中。他們婆娑起舞，夜以繼日，簡直忘却了一切。但跳舞在上海，却只有一段很短的歷史。</p>
<p>上海最初的跳舞，原是洋人們的玩意兒，那時外白渡橋堍的禮查飯店，跑馬廳畔的卡爾登，每逢星期六和星期日晚上，舉行交際茶舞，華人是絕無僅有的。民國十二年，一品香旅社也仿辦交際茶舞，那時達官貴人，寄寓於一品香旅邸者頗多，茶舞倒也熱鬧，這可以說是上海最早的華人跳舞塲。</p>
<p>營業舞塲·黑猫首創</p>
<p>營業性質的舞塲，首推西藏路寗波同鄕會隔壁的黑貓舞廳。備有舞女伴舞，每元伴舞三次，也是那時定下的價格。黑貓舞廳開幕後，一品香的茶舞，就無形取消了。接着開設約有愛多亞路的桃花宮，北四川路的月宮，寗波路的立道。但那時上海會跳舞的人很少，錯了步伐，翻了觔斗，狼狽不堪的，時有所聞，往往爲西人所訕笑，而社會方面，亦不像目前的放任，男女樓抱，殊不雅觀，頗多攻擊之言，舞塲營業，並不十分發達。</p>
<p>跳舞流行日久，漸覺習以爲常，遊人日多，於是新設立之舞塲，風起雲湧，如大東。大滬。辣斐。大華等先後成立，營業均稱不惡。那時更有一種小型舞塲，乃是投機者吸引中等階級舞客而設的，如順風。夜總會。逍遙。勝利。惠令登等紛紛繼起，舞票改爲每元五跳至八跳，茶資减至二角或四角。至此一般普通薪水階級，甚至商店中的小職員，均做了舞塲中入幕之賓，跳舞在上海，慢慢地大衆化了。那時舞塲營業雖盛，可是對於顧客，頗爲重視，不失遷就之意。決不會有舞女大班來介紹坐檯子，纏夾不淸，使人啼笑皆非。迨後受世界經濟恐慌的影響，上海市面，籠罩着「不景氣」，營業格外遷就，好多一元三跳的舞場，不惜降格以求，改爲一元五跳。差不多的舞塲，都舉行下午茶舞，奉送茗點，吸引顧客。可是帶了舞侶進去，仍得破費茶資，因爲舞塲和舞女，無非希望在舞票上，多點收入。最初紅舞星是不屑參加茶舞的，但漸漸在生活鞭子的驅策之下，也有許多改做茶舞了。這是舞業走向下坡的一個階段。</p>
<p>「八一三」的砲火，打破了上海人紙醉金迷的奢華生活。但在國軍西撤以後，上海市容又漸漸地繁華起來。那時添了一班由內地來滬避難的富商大賈，這許多挾有巨資而無所事事的人們，縱情聲色，使上海的娛樂界，畸形發展起來，舞塲當然是不會例外的。舊的舞塲先後復業，新開舞場，也有好幾家。但因租界戒嚴關係，晚舞八時就開始了，每逢星期六晚上，則通宵營業，有幾家甚至於每晚通脊。茶舞仍是很普遍的舉行着，許多中型和小型的舞塲，更有所謂午餐舞，如果有興的話，你可以從中午十二時起，跳至翌晨四時止。</p>
<p>孤島舞市如痴如狂</p>
<p>那時孤島上的居民，對於跳舞，好似瘋在一般，不論白天晚上，舞塲裏總是坐得滿滿的，星期六更是擁擠萬分。舞池中只見摩肩接踵，萬頭攢動，洋琴鬼又分外賣力，一曲甫終，一曲又起，累得狂熱的舞客，不　息足。全塲是籠單在脂粉烟酒的氣氛喪，直到舞客們懷中的鈔票，盡送進了舞女的皮包中，大家纔興盡而歸。這時在漫長的前綫，難有上千禽的將士們在浴血抗戰，可是上海已聽不到砲聲了，悲慘的往事，也由糢糊而淡忘了，那裏還記得到國難與家難」！</p>
<p>勝利後</p>
<p>勝利後的上海，舞塲更像吹過春風後的野草，顯得生涯鼎盛。美國水手們，袋裏貯藏了好幾個月來無法消耗的美金票，上岸後當然要盡情作樂一下。舞塲老闆接得了一批洋財神，眞是笑口常開。可是水手們醉後打架閙事，也是舞塲中所感覺到頭疼的。而且好景不長，水手們的袋裏，慢慢地空虛了，舞塲的營業，也隨而下落，於是紛紛改變營業方針，仍繼續去做華人的買賣。</p>
<h3>交際舞　解寂寞祛煩慮</h3>
<p>跳舞之風，流傳到中國，已幾乎是聲色中的一種重要項目了。公子哥兒們大都以交際爲藉口，達到他們玩弄女性的目的。伴舞的娘兒們，好多也是由窰子裏姑娘幢變而來的。舞塲遂爲滿足肉慾之地。　在歐美各國，跳舞的背景和立塲，却和中國截然不同。男女雙方，不是朋友，即是同事，因好此道，纔一起去跳舞的。他們根本認跳舞爲一種室內運動，一種美化的情調，所以跳的輕鬆而自然。解寂寞，祛煩慮，眞是別有一番風味。在大宴會上，聯翩起舞，應拍中節，更不可少，這纔眞正够得上交際二字。</p>
<p>初期的交際舞，當然是很呆板的。迨後社會上男女間的關係，漸趨自由，舞藝更比較輕鬆，步法也日見複雜，由「慢板」而轉爲「快板」了。這轉變的宗旨不外是異性互相吸引，以美化之音樂旋律，調劑社交之枯燥，此之謂高等情調！</p>
<h3>五十年前舊話　上海道署跳舞會　中國官塲第一遭</h3>
<p>遜淸光緒二十三年（西層一八九六年）舊層十月初十日，爲慈禧太后萬壽　辰，上海通蔡鈞大開盛宴，招待外賓，舉行跳舞大會，此爲中國官塲以跳舞會招待外賓的第一次，也是上海之有公開跳舞的第一次。</p>
<p>跳舞會會塲設在靜安寺路洋務局行轅內；由馬路大門至行轅門外，懸明角琉璃燈數千　，五光十色，閃爍輝煌，燈角掛五色絲，隨風飄舞。同時又裝電燈數百蓋，照耀如同白晝。內設衣帽房，手杖架。大餐廳上，排列着工字形餐桌，花團錦簇，酒冽肴香。舞廳設在內院，柚木地板。光滑可鑑。另闢休息室，吸烟室，梳妝室，更衣室，窗明几凈，陳設一新。走廊遍懸各國國旗，加以據幔綵綢。這一番佈置，當時着實費了許多心血。</p>
<p>事前，蔡道發請柬六百份，邀請各國領事，英美法德水師提督，及旅滬各國紳商仕女到會，蔡道率譯員鳳太守及洋務局會辦，提調，會審公堂各委員往來招待。巡捕房亦派譯員多人，帮同照料。西樂一班，由領班「裴納」從香港帶來，共四十人，亦參與盛會。</p>
<p>這一天新到貴賓，或戎裝甲胄，或着禮服，佩寳星，婦女則狐裘蒙茸，鮮妍奪目。招待者亦衣冠整肅，躬自迎送。所備菜餚，至爲豐美，杯盤刀叉，極一時之選。席散後，來賓略作休息，俟女客梳洗後，即舉行跳舞。直至東方已白，來賓始興盡而返。　事後外僑對於蔡道，歌頌備至。謂蔡道接待西人，不僅彬彬有禮，亦且深諳西俗，不以中國禮節束縛西人。尤其是這一决的跳舞會，確是破例，於恭辦慶典之中’寓聯絡邦交之意，禮敬西人，實不多覯云云。這一次上海破天荒的跳舞會，實開風氣之先，雖在當時一般人看來，不免有點不入眼。</p>
<h3>舞男</h3>
<p>「舞男」這名詞，大家也許感到很生疏罷，本來在男女平等的原則下，旣有舞女，也應有舞男。在歐美各國舞塲中，舞男並不希罕，他們也和舞女一樣，伴人跳舞，在中國這風氣究竟尙行不通。</p>
<p>在民國廿六年，百樂門曾有舞男出現。據說他是一向以敎授跳舞爲業的名家，由某舞女的介紹，進百樂門舞廳，每晚在那裏敎舞，同時隨時可以陪伴小姐太太們跳舞。可是曇花一現，沒有幾天就不見了，以後便繼起無人。</p>
<h3>火山上的孃兒們　從黃毛丫頭到紅星</h3>
<p>舞女是舞塲最重要的一環。商店要貨足，酒舘要菜好，舞塲當然要舞女漂亮。如票眞的紅星如雲，則堂堂陣容，營業之盛，指日可待。</p>
<p>舞女們的生活，是富於悲劇性的，我們只看到她們濃裝豔服，滿面春風，却不知道在笑容的後面，實在充滿着辛酸之淚。她們大都是落後的小市民或中產階級，爲了窮，爲了生活，迫着走上火山，出賣她們的靑春。雖然號稱世界大都市的上海，婦女職業的出路，仍少得可憐，何况她們大都沒有機會受過敎育，更沒有適當工作可做，即使有工可做，也沒有這許多工廠來收容她們，而且工資微薄又養不活她們。她們家中，大都有寡母，有弱弟幼妹，父親雖在，也是貧病交迫，整個一副家庭生活重担，都擱在她們的肩上，為了生存，為了都市中的需求，不得不出來伴舞。</p>
<p>預備當舞女，先得去學跳舞，上海有幾家舞藝傳習所，對於這班准舞女，往往特別優待，不收學費。只要在那裏耐心地學上十天半月，懂得幾種步法，就可以正式下海了。</p>
<p>學成　學成後，由小姊妹或舞藝所介紹到舞塲中去，最初只能進小舞塲。事前還得東借西凑，籌筆費用，置辦些時髦服裝，經過一番燙髪美容的手續，草草應付，於是進塲，開始她的伴舞生涯。</p>
<p>小舞塲裹的設備簡陋，舞客粗鄙，毫無可道。在小舞塲中混過一年半載之後，門路慢慢地熟了，結識的小姊妹也多了，同時還有些相熟的舞客。這時她們到頭二等舞塲中去觀光，看到了偉大的塲面，當然打動她們的芳心，便設法升遷到較高級的舞塲中去。</p>
<p>升遷　升遷是不容易的，除了面貌身段不差外，還要有較精的舞藝，和較好的談吐應酬功夫，衣服裝飾，也該考究些。最重要的是兜得轉的闊老們替效撑腰捧塲。否則升遷後，生意也維持不下去，反而有失面子，所謂爬得高跌得重是也。這樣由三等而二等而頭等，一級一級升上去，一個品貌端正，舞藝嫻熟，而有手腕的舞女，三五年後，便有踏進頭等舞塲的希望。</p>
<p>舞女們的收入，以舞票爲主，舞票須與舞塲拆賬，最紅的舞女，可得十分之七，舞塲得十分之三，次一級的，四六拆，「阿桂姐」們，只有對分了。舞女和舞塲拆賬後，還要經過舞女大班一重剝削，再分去二三成，實際所得很有限的。</p>
<p>檯子　坐　子收入雖較多，可是普通舞女不是每夜輪得到，祗有那些紅得發紫的舞星，一夜可轉八只十只檯子。現在最紅的舞女，每月收入近千萬元，這龐大的數字，令人咋舌，可是最悽涼的「桂花」舞女，每月收入，却不滿十萬元。</p>
<p>舞客們進舞塲，目的在尋歡作樂，舞女們當然不能板起了面孔。可是粗鄙的舞客們，在伴舞外，往往作種種不堪入目的調笑，舞女們笑逐顏開地應付，只能背人暗泣。在人慾橫流的上海，舞客更向舞女作進一步的要求，涉世禾深的黃毛丫頭，在金錢的誘惑之下，往往獻出了父母所遺留的淸白之軀，而任其宰割。</p>
<p>紅星　本來爬上紅星的寳座是很難的，在一色」「藝」「交際」「氣派」等各方面都要有特長，同時又能號召大批客人，川流不息地來捧她。不過這種奢靡生活，單靠正常舞票收入斷難維持，即使一夜轉檯十次，也只能換得五萬元（每次平均舞票一萬元，須與塲方及舞女大班拆賬）。所以她們最大的收入，還在闊佬們的額外賞賜，這當然有交換條件的。其間神秘關係，不言可喩。</p>
<p>在充滿着荒淫的舞塲裏，舞女很容易受環境的潛移默化。許多大紅大紫的舞女，渡過難關以後，也往往隨波逐流，祗圖眼前的狂歡，不思身世之飄零。至於墮落，不堪救藥，令人長嘆。</p>
<p>禁舞</p>
<p>現在向市政府警察局登記的舞女，已超過了二千名，她們都是靑年女子，年齡自十三四歲至三十歲左右。上海可說是舞女的製造廠，除分布全市各舞塲外，還得供應外埠及海外各地的需要，近如南京，蘇州，杭州，遠則平，津，大連，靑島，香港，厦門，甚至南洋各地都有她們的踪跡。可是京杭各地，已先後禁舞，上海的舞塲，也受不景氣的打擊，這班鶯鶯燕燕們，生活凄慘，是可以預料得到的。</p>
<h3>舞藝傳習所</h3>
<p>跳舞旣成爲一種流行的玩意兒，許多醉心於跳舞的人們，必須先去學習，免得在舞池裏「栽筋斗」。預備去當舞女的，更非先懂得幾種步法不可。於是許多跳舞學校與舞藝傳習所應遝而生，現在經警察局糾正，已一律改稱「舞藝傳習所」了。</p>
<p>舞藝傳習所大都設在破舊的洋房中，或××大厦的樓上，那裏僅有一間逼仄的小房間，沒有瑰麗的畫壁，玲瓏的花燈，只有幾把半新舊的坐椅，幾盞美術燈，和一些零辭的紙花，還有有一架不可缺少的留聲機，簡陋粗俗，與富麗堂皇的舞塲相比，誠有天壤之別，可是塗上蠟的地板，也和舞塲裏一樣的光滑。</p>
<p>那裏的學生，有富家的姨太太，預備常舞女的小家碧玉，洋行職員，大學生，行將出國的空軍。又有許多長三堂子裏的姑娘，因爲生意不好，也到那裏去習舞，想兼當舞女。那裏還有許多經濟不甚充裕的小職員，或是在舞塲中玩膩了的公子哥兒，雖然舞已會跳，也到這裏來追歡取樂。</p>
<p>那裘有所謂「敎授」和「助敎」，你化了三五萬元，就可以在他們指導之下，來學習研究了。最初是由助敎指導，到了相當程度，然後「敎授」親自出馬。所調課程，通常祇有「狐步舞」，「勃羅司」，「華爾斯」等幾種，至於再要學習別種步法，那必須額外交費。</p>
<p>當學員們的舞藝，已有一點成績，男女便可以權充伴侶，在那裏婆娑起舞了。這時那些預備去做舞女的學員，對於男學員們；盡其誘惑的能事。當她們快要離開傳習所的時償，竟個　不客編地對你說：「帮帮忙」。</p>
<h3>跳舞敎授　大班出身</h3>
<p>這班「准舞女」學成之後，大都由傳習所代她們介紹到舞塲中去，好在那裏的敎授，大都是落伍的舞女大班，介紹一兩個舞女，尙不為難。「敎授」們常常自詡地說：「你看××等紅舞星，都是我們這裏訓練出來的呀！」其實在那裏所學到的祗是幾種簡單膚淺的步法，因為舞女大班出身的敎授，並不能眞正了解跳舞的藝術，至於這班所謂「助敎」，更是可笑，他們大都是沒落的公子哥兒：文不能執筆，武不能挑担，祇有以變相的「舞男」姿態出現，伺候他人了。</p>
<p>過去舞藝傳習所，略帶營業性質，也有茶舞，晚舞等名目。學員們在規定的學習時間之外，如要參加跳舞，可以買幾張練習券，其實即是舞票的變相。那時在舞塲裏一元祗有三跳五跳，而傳習所的練習票，一元却可以買到十六張之多。於是許多會打算盤的朋友，趨之若驚，小小的房間裏，擠滿着一對對摟抱着的男女。許多女學員臨時充作舞女，因她們所付的學費很低，甚至完全免費，所以這是應盡的義務了。　「跳舞爲八大藝術之一，不能跳舞，就缺去了人生交際史上的一頁。」舞藝傳習所雖以這句話來宣傳號召，另有人却把那裏當作社交的「聖地」，調情的「天堂」，婚姻的媒介所的，也不在少數。</p>
<p>（下圖爲當年仙榮舞宮）</p>
<h3>夕陽無限好　只是近黃昏　衰落中的舞塲</h3>
<p>在舞業範圍內，也是後浪推前浪的局面，失風了的舞塲倒下去後，新的無塲又很快地建立起來。現今上海舞塲，向市警察局登記的，共有廿七家，有舞女一千八百餘名，他們是點綴都市繁榮的銷金之窟。</p>
<p>高聳於跑馬廳畔的國際飯店，裏面有極富麗的舞塲，每逢星期日有茶舞。但不備舞女，必須自帶女伴。氣派的華貴，僕歐的彬彬有禮，可以傲視其他舞塲，而食品價格之高昂”也爲他家所不及。</p>
<p>愚園路的百樂門，以遠東最華貴的舞廳為號召。的確，當那建築初落成的時候，舞池的玻璃地板，是別出心裁的。靜安寺路的仙樂，原為源遜私人的交際塲所後由謝葆生租了下來，改爲營業舞塲。在內部和外表，多够得上富麗堂皇四個字，可惜舞池太小，人一多便覺得無廻翔的餘地。</p>
<p>麗都舞廳在麥特赫斯脫路，原爲上海富商住宅。其中除廣大舞池外，尙有瑰麗的飯店，精緻的花園，其旁又附設游泳池。戈登路之大都會，也以花園舞廳著稱，有圓形古典式的舞池，露天的靑苑舞塲，曲折的花徑，以及哥爾夫球塲，種種設置，與麗都有異曲同工之妙。與大都會前後遙遙相對的是維也納，設備也很精緻。距大都會之北不遠，還有一家新仙林，也是一座花園住宅所改建的，略具園林之勝。</p>
<p>愛多亞路的大華，正對跑馬廳的大滬，都是資格很老的舞塲，過去曾有一個時期是很紅的。大滬旁邊的小都會，塲池小得可以，可謂名副其實。他和大滬在戰前是專做水手生意的。　旅館而兼營舞塲者，最早是大東和揚子。揚子以彈簧地板聞名，大東也不見弱。現在西藏路上，旅館附設舞塲者已處處皆是，像遠東，聖太樂等，都設在旅館下層、連霞飛路上的偉達，也兼營舞業了。</p>
<p>全市舞塲二十七家，其座上客，以商塲，中人爲多，過去投機之風極盛的時候，掮客們祇須一舉手之勞，就可以賺進千百萬，對於舞女們捧塲報效，自然毫無吝色。但在市面不景氣的年頭，他們也很少這雅興了。至於其他的「貴顯」以及「小開」們，不過略爲點綴門面而已。　當舞塲營業一落千丈的時候，大家都在想招攬顧客的辦法。大舞廳則竭力拉攏紅星來吸引舞客，有的還是臨時客串性質，但一次至少也可以撈進數百萬。過去曾發生過廣吿戰，競以舞星的名字，在報紙上用大號字刊布出來，以資號召，現在此風又盛了。</p>
<p>歌唱也是很好的營業工具，這是舞塲中的活動廣告，幾位紅歌星，到處趕塲，像歐陽飛鶯等，每月收入可觀，塲方沾光不少。此外武技與滑稽戲等特別節目，在舞塲裏也很流行，包銀有限，客人倒很喜歡的。　有幾家舞塲，把茶舞和茶室舞合而爲一，從前要泡二次茶的，現在祇泡一次，可以從下午二時，接連玩到七時，樂此不疲的客人，占得便宜不少。</p>
<h3>大都會畸形事業　上海舞女調查所</h3>
<p>舞索的蒸蒸日上，乃大都市中的畸形發鷹，再進而又有以舞業爲樂的機關，那便是所謂「舞女調查所保嘆所忽然動了腦筋，附設一個舞市調查所。所宣佈的宗旨是服務社會，為人羣謀幸福，可脫是「光明正大」。民國三十年，又有「舞女調查所」出現了，那是國人主排的，他們大都是失敗的舞塲人負，或是沒落的籌塲「孝子」，居然給他們想出一種有　頭的新事業來。</p>
<p>調查所的營業範圍：（二）為家庭調查其子女。世故未深的少年，在上海最易墮落，舞塲中多的是尙在求學或初入社會的靑年，因此而荒廢其學業。爲父母者可委託該所矚查，俾得洞悉其隱，且可代為看管。（二）為妻子調查其丈夫。在許多家庭中，每有丈夫跳舞，趨而熱戀，甚至拋棄家中的「黃臉婆」於不顧者。妻子爲防患未然計，欲刺探丈夫在外行踪者，可委託該所調查。同樣丈失因妻子在外交際跳舞，情有可疑，亦可請其調查。（三）爲客人調查其舞女。客人熱戀舞女，已爲今日舞塲中所常見，但對於舞女之背景，何人「撑腰」，有無「拖車」，是否爲了客人的金錢而與舞客周旋，該所能探得一切密，使不致演出種種惡化事端。（四）為舞女調查其舞客。在上海有滑頭的舞女，也有滑前沿的舞客。往往一進舞塲，舉目闊綽，舞女易受其惑，因而失身者。舞女欲　探舞客身世，調查所亦可代為服務。</p>
<p>調查所收費是以時間計算的，從前普通手續費爲五十元，再加公費二十元就够了。假使調查手續較爲復雜，不能在一星期內完畢，收費也比例地增加。</p>
<p>上海本是滑頭世界，祇有能動腦筋的，才得發財。舞女調查所無非爲了法幣，也祇有在上海的畸形社會中纔能够存在。眞是「奇事到處有，唯有上海多」了。</p>
<h3>跳舞救災</h3>
<p>「假使不用女人來做幌子，　吝者皮包中的鈔票，怎樣會飛出來呢」？</p>
<p>莫看跳舞是一種娛樂，是一種消耗，舞女們也想替社會盡一點責任。我國是個多災多難的國家，過去救國聲浪高唱入雲的時候，竟有人喊出「跳舞救國」的口號。雖然跳舞是救不了國，但遇到有什麼賑災的事，舞女們却可以號召一下。今年轟動一時的上海小姐選舉，裏面也有舞星一組，嘉惠蘇北難民不少。</p>
<p>在上海小姐選舉中，舞星組較爲單純。參加者祇有管敏莉，李珍珍，顧利華三人，李顧二人臨時又不參加競選，於是成爲管敏莉一人之天下。不過並不因爲只剩一人而减少了號召的力量，管敏莉仍得到二三一五〇票，獲得皇后寳座。亞后則屬於顧利華。</p>
<p>舞女們參加競選上海小姐的，雖然不多，但在事前，曾舉行過義舞，以嚮應救濟蘇北難民。各舞塲各自指定一天，義舞義賣。那一天舞女們收入的舞票，舞塲中賣得的茶資，悉數充作捐款。結果舞女獲得甲種獎章者有徐琴芳等九人，其中周莉娟，葉妹妹又獲得特種紀念品。得乙種獎章者有李珍珍等十八人。舞塲方面，得榮譽獎狀者有米高美，大華，仙樂，皇后，大路，遠東，高峯，小都會，國聯等九家，就在八月二十日選舉上海小姐的熱鬧塲面中給獎的。</p>
<p>以舞女爲號召來募捐，並非創舉，過去也有過好多次，不過今年是格外熱閙罷了。這種盛舉，在一般人看來，是毀譽參平的。贊成的人說：她們具有一片熱心救災的慈善心腸，發揮了人類互助的精神。但也有許多冷嘲，熱諷的話，打入她們的耳鼓。他們說：假使不用女人來做幌子，慳吝者皮包中的鈔票，怎樣會飛出來呢？但從另一方面有，這樣大的號召力，確是値得傲視男子們的。無怪要有「遂令天下父母心，不重生男重生女」之慨了。</p>

<h3>某銀行家觀察　金融危機已將過去　存款準備充實自能免除意外</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃訪某銀行家，詢問金融界一般情形，承見吿如下：（一）此次因黃金漲風引起之銀行業危機，已將過去。在此次事件中，可看出適當存款準備之重要。在戰前能有百分之二十準備，已屬十分安全；但在目前幣値不穩定之狀况下，準備率必須提高。本市最有信用銀行之存款準備，超過百分之五十十；但一般基礎較薄弱之銀行，求利之心過切，往往其準備只有一二成，遂致提存風潮發生後，無法應付。而此實爲黃金投機之外，造成銀行擱淺之主因。深盼各遭受打擊之行家，能接受此次敎訓，則對於今後金融市塲之安定，裨益甚大。（二）在此次金價之大起大落中，中央銀行無疑爲一勝利者，不但金價爲其壓低，且本身亦有收入。按粗疏之估計，央行此次恐已收入七十億元左右。（三）關於明年度之銀行賬簿，聞外商銀行已決定取消角分單位，以省記賬手續。我國銀行公會方面，亦有此項建議，但迄未微得各主要行家之同意，因一則此事涉及國家之幣制，二則繳納直接稅時角分不可略去，茲事體大，不便貿然決定。（四）明年度政府對於商業銀行之管理，勢必加强，而管理之中心，犬致爲檢查資金之逃至香港。此類逃資流至香港後，即用於支付不能請准外匯之進口。目前央行金融檢查處之工作甚爲認眞，但人手尙嫌不够。將來如能加强人力，則監督商業銀行會計，亦可收防止資金逃避之效。（五）外間謠傳明年將發行五千元之大鈔，又謂一月間將改訂匯率。在金融業之立塲言，五千元大鈔並無需要，此說當係謠言無疑。至於改訂匯率，在理論上固爲必要，但鑒於上次改訂時刺激物價之情形，勢必萬分愼重，至於確切日期，事關機密，外閒所傳，一切均屬推測而已。</p>
<h3>國絲加工外銷　官民意見分歧</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於國絲加工外銷辦法，官民兩方之觀點尙未一致。官方希望供給生絲一千四百擔，人造絲兩千箱，交由民營綢廠代織，由政府按織品之性質，予以適當之「工價」，使風雨飄搖中之絲廠，得以勉渡難關，不致倒閉。在織造期內所需之流動資金，爲數的在六十億元左右，亦將由四聯免息供給。至於成品之銷售，完全爲政府之事，盈虧與絲綢廠無關。自政府之立塲言，海外市塲必須保持，不能中斷，即使無利可圖，外銷亦需繼續。况生絲之加工外銷，可增加外匯頭寸，蓋生絲每擔之售價，約為八百美金，但織成綢緞後輸出，約可得價款一千五百美金，除去一切必要開支，至少亦有一千二百美金，固甚合算。對於民營綢廠自製自銷，有關方面表示難於同意，理由爲：（一）工廠使負「加工」之責，原料屬於公家，成品亦屬公家，銷售自應由公家負責，（二）銷售風險甚大，如有虧損，決非資本五億元之機構所能負責；自以由政府代辦爲宜。因公家所着目者爲取得外匯及保持市塲，盈虧乃决要之考慮，與私人之經營不同。截至目前爲止，彼此僅有原則上之同意，詳細辦法尙待商討，最後需由行政當局決定，方能實行。</p>
<h3>來華商輪　美佔首位</h3>
<p>頃據航業界權威方面發表，本年度（自一月至八月止）進出我國海港之商輸，當以美國爲首，計六百六十九艘，共二百六十九萬五千七百二十噸。英國第二，計八百二十六艘，共一百六十萬三千五百六十一噸。其他日輸竟亦　　蘇聯之上而　佔第三。而我國商輪總共不過二百六十五艘，計二十九萬七千八百八十二噸，且皆係舊輪，何堪與他國互爭一日之短長，須待所定一百萬噸來華後，我航業始略有一綫光明</p>
<h3>美日貿易　恢復戰前水準</h3>
<p>據本市美僑商界重要人士稱，美國與日本之貿易已恢復戰前之水準，而本年下半年，又比上半年更加發展。一九三六年至一九三八年美國輸往日本平均每”爲二〇，三〇〇，〇〇〇美元，而自日本輸入爲一三，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元。上述統計數字包括朝鮮與台灣在內。美國於一九四六年六月輸往日本之總數爲一六，九〇〇，〇〇〇美元，七月爲一六，九〇〇，〇〇〇美元，八月爲二〇，二〇〇，〇〇〇美元，同年六月自日本輸人計一四，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，七月計一一，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，八月計一二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元。</p>
<h3>商店造假賬</h3>
<p>經濟部設法防止</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部頃以戰後商業界造假賬之風甚熾，殊屬匪是。現正會同有關當局，共擬一商業會計法，使商業界之會計制度，能步入正軌。同時將規定：如製造假賬，藉以欺朦他人者，將由法律上治以應得之罪云。</p>
<h3>渝工商業倒閉多　擬援例請求貸款救濟</h3>
<p>渝市工商業，現因外貨充斥，各貨銷滯，均在極困難情形下盡力掙扎，倒閉停業者，時有所聞，據稅務機關統計，近兩月來，本市工商業倒閉者已達二十餘家，年關在週，繼踵者是否尙有，自難預斷，現各業爲挽救當前危局起見，擬向政府請求，按照救濟上海工商業貸款辦法，貸款與本市工商業，其具體辦法，正在商訂中。</p>
<h3>新舊年團逼近　檢討本市工商狀況</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕今日爲卅五年度十二月卅日，陽關已到，陰關亦僅二旬矣，回　一年來工商業在幣値貶落外貨侵淩，高利貸壓榨之下，幾造成空前未有之危局，在此一年中，金價自一月四日紅盤開出之七十八萬五千元而躍至三百卅萬元，最高且曾創三百九十五萬元空前價格美鈔自一三八五元躍至七八〇〇元（廿三日之價），各工廠商店之財產雖隨物價之高漲而增値，而其負債之數字，因受高利盤剝，更較其財產增加數倍，本年度在工業方面，較之商業更爲困難，中央社記者曾分訪各工業界，獲悉其所遭遇之痛苦，大致相同，爲一原料缺乏，二捐稅太高，三工潮起伏，四高利盤剝，商業方面，則並不若外間宣傳之駭人聽聞，前傳本年底南京路上商店將有百分之卅倒閉，此聳人聽聞之數字，似並不可靠，據南京路商聯會負責人稱，「南京路商店情形若何，現雖無從估計，然一般均在竭力支持，希望能安渡舊歷年關，但在此時期內，與社會整個經濟有極大關係，如果情形平穩，當可减少倒閉，否則南京路上確或有若干商店恐難以維持也」云云。然事實亦不能否認各業之嚴重性，霞飛路上已有若干商店將大門緊閉，公司商號之倒閉者日有所聞，全市商店確有一部份，因受市民購買力薄弱及高利貸之剝削，而將隨卅五年同逝。但如果在陰歷年關前，最近廿多天內，本市金融能風平浪靜，安然過去，則將能敉將倒而未倒之多數工商業也」，記者昨特分訪本市各業十餘單位之負責人，叩詢一年來之情形，及如何渡過新舊兩年關，據金融業巨子，布商會理事長徐寄廎氏之看法，前途並不悲觀。</p>
<p>經濟前途　並不悲觀據稱「最近我國生產能力低减，工商業不景氣，影響物價上漲，法幣貶値，黃金風潮，更不惜推波助瀾，造成恐慌事態，誠爲當前事實，然而余可斷言，將來情形可逐漸轉好，且可撥開雲翳，瞬現晴空，因不景氣之頂點，即繁榮之前夕，是以吾人之觀念，我國經濟前途，決不如想像之嚴重，更不致發生經濟崩漬之危機，例如央行對平抑黃金價格，已收有相當成效，此外四聯總處中央銀行及新近組設生產事業貸款臨時審委會對正當生產貸款均陸續大宗貸放，此種措施，於加强生產，靈活經濟，賞爲新活力，關於本市日用品及食米價格一點，則認爲吳市長對抑平市價，頗具決心，且甚有效，預料將來亦不致上漲云」。</p>
<p>錢業年關可望安渡</p>
<p>錢業公會理事長沈日新，渠認爲錢業必可安渡年關，日前之金潮澎湃，銀根帶緊，予各同業之影響極微，據氏稱，當時最顧著者，厥爲拆放頭寸驟形减少而已。所幸爲期短促，轉瞬即逝，今已好轉，且銀錢業聯準會對同業已繳準備財產，如房地產等，經評價在地政局登記後，即發公庫證，可憑此向該會以當日規定之拆息申請拆放，而資調劑，氏又稱本市現有會員，錢莊七十二家，包括內地遷來永生永慶義豐三家，及已獲財政部核准行將復業者四家，預料本年底當可安然渡過。且各莊均可盈餘，至市塲動盪，本業所感覺者，輒爲商業往來「摺交」方面呈存少欠多之家，若爲短期放款，尙不受多大牽製。</p>
<p>毛絨業好百貸呌苦</p>
<p>至於各商業，並不一定皆受社會經濟不景氣之影響，如毛絨業等本年均皆能安渡。而百貨酒菜業則反是，尤其酒菜業虧本者佔百分之六十以上。據酒菜業同業公會負責人稱：加入該會之同業有五百餘家，但有百分之六十至七十均虧本，在最近半個月內，由請停業者有十餘家，由此可見營業情形之一般。該負責人又稱：「高利貸固爲該業之致命傷，而捐稅之繁重，每一餐館須負擔營業稅所得稅利得稅印花稅牌照稅等六種，致飯菜擭格無形中被提高。營業因此更受影響，渠等唯一希望，爲筵席捐之征收仍照國府規定標準辦理，則營業或可稍見起色。至於年關，一部份勉强可以渡過，但被迫停業者爲數或不在少也。百貨業亦不景氣，較大幾家，可以說早成價的狀態。據該公會負責人稱：他們會員商店普通都是因爲購買力低，所以營業就非常淸淡，在九十月物價漲風時，一般均皆儘量進貨，甚至借高利貸買進。但事實上原來預計在二三個月內可以售出之貨物，結果經過五六個月還未能售完，現一方面營業情形不佳，一方面要付高利貸的利息，所以大多數都在呌苦。他們希望政府能够低利息貸款。至於年關，雖然在萬分困難中，都想竭力設法渡過。</p>
<p>毛絨業，除今年上半年尙有一部份商店停業外，現在一般都很好，公會會員共六十三家，據公會的負責人稱：毛絨利潤很薄，今年來源幷不感到威脅，供求方面亦均平衡。尤其是價格一向平穩，無巨大波動，年關無問題，皆可平安渡過。鐘錶業公會有會員的三百家，一般營業均甚良好，現市上所售之鐘錶皆由美國人自動進口，所以鐘錶業從今年四月份以後，即未向國外直接定貨。年關雖到，商業不景氣中，他們均可平安渡過。</p>
<p>棉布顏料情形較好</p>
<p>棉布業悄形今年尙稱良好，據公會負責人稱：營業狀况除最近一個月較差外，其餘時間大都很好，同業公會會員，去年祗有八百家，最近增加到一千四百家。普通一般較殷實者均可敷衍，僅有少數用利息者比較稍差。但同業中百分之九十均可渡過，僅有少數須視舊曆年關前整個經濟情形如何來決定他們的命運。顏料商營業情形，比較其他各業要好得多。公會會員原來是一八四家，今年新開和閉歇都有，現在會員共約有二百家，營業情形因來源不多，大部份供不應求，因爲顏料來源戰前均向國外美恒汽包華洋行定購，現該各行皆已停業，故目前來源完全靠着敵產管理處拍賣德孚洋行之敵產顏料來維持。美國貨顏料進口也很多，他們希望輸入管理委員會替他們代辦結匯購貨，以暢來源。</p>
<p>進口繁榮　出口冷淡</p>
<p>本市進出口業，進口商方面在一切「洋化」中，當然繁榮，利潤亦絞一般商業爲高，而出口業則慘淡得毫無生氣。據進出口業商業同業公會負責人談：本市進口貨物在十一月十七日進口管理辦法公布以前，頗爲踴躍，日用百貨皆有進口，而其中以棉花及汽車爲數最鉅。進口管理辦法公布以後，政府規定凡貨物在美金二千元以下者，可自由由請進口；美金二千元以上之貨物，必須呈經輸入品管理委員會核准後方可進口。進口業在卅五年度內尙稱繁榮，利潤亦尙稱不惡，惟出口業景况不佳，出口貨物以桐油猪　爲大宗，旺月時的每月輸出二千噸，淡月時的一千噸左右。我國絲茶本亦爲大宗出口品，惟本年內景况極差，該業公會當局希望明年能有新的農開，希望進口同業顧到國家社會實際之需要，輸入民生必需品及生產器材，儘量减少奢侈品之輸入。出口業前塵慘淡，希望政府對於資金運輸等各方面予以協助與獎勵。再者南洋方面本爲我國輸出品市塲，布匹及一般日用品皆可推銷，惟近年來爲印度所奪去，亟宜奮起直追，恢復舊觀，實爲明年度出口業之要圖。本年一年來之地產賈賣，可說在近數十年來交易最少之一年。據該業公會負責人談：房地產商業，自中央明令規定房地產禁止租借抵押後，所有業務，已一落千丈，現再由市府規定一切地產等應照民二十六年時之作價，以四百倍計，納千分之十五地價稅。如爲遺產，又常納遺產稅。在此民生凋敝，捐稅重重之際，若求出售，亦無人置購，故終造成全年停頓狀態。無法打開僵局。</p>
<p>營造業與地產業有連帶關係，地產旣不能活動，乃影響營造。此外據該業公會負責人談，尙有主要原因三：（一）工商界凋敝，無力建築大規模之高樓廣廈，以及較大之工廠，所有之大工程，僅靠政府方面一部份事業建築，如修鋪路面，建修飛機塲等之建築。（二）承包對象業主爲民營者，如中途業主因營業失利而吿倒帳，則承包之建築公司定受牽累。（三）在物價及工人生活指數波動不息之情况下，包建包工均屬不易，估價太高，無人問津；估價太低，又要虧本，更往往已向業主估正價格，訂定合同，開工後物價突漲，或工人要求改定工資，如此非虧無疑，故在找尋主顧時已不易，承包到手則更難之情况下，實難維持。據統計結果，僅保華建築公司，陶桂記營造廠，成泰建築公司等可以維持，全業十分之六，七，均已難以支持矣。</p>
<p>談捲煙業舉一反三</p>
<p>本年度工業方面，除棉紡業外，均有維持爲難之慨。記者以時間關係不及分訪各工業之同業公會，但僅此所訪之捲烟製革針織等各工業，已可概見本市工業嚴重之一般情形矣。捲烟業在下半年度因受高利貸壓榨，營業不振，會連倒數家。據捲烟業公會理事長戴畊莘，及該公會秘書趙爾昌稱：該業目前最大之困難，計有四大點：（一）原料來源缺乏，（二）高利貸的盤剝，（三）捐稅太高，（四）工潮此起彼伏。近悉政府因香烟價之上升，又將調整稅額，捲菸業實因無法担負，乃會商議決推派包賡笙（利興香烟廠），沈崑三（頤中烟廠）金亦耕（華美烟廠），李子唐（國華烟廠），張雨文（大東南），郭可詠（南洋烟廠）等六人，於二十七日夜車晋京向稅務署幫顯，請求暫免調整稅顧，同時並於二十六日下午三時召開全體會員臨時大會，議決工人年賞，照每人月薪加一月，以示獎勵，並採取一致行動，不准任意加减云。</p>
<p>皮革針織　均無起色</p>
<p>據皮革業公會理事長張善璋稱二皮革業在戰後仍無起色，主要原因是外貨充塞，低價傾銷，致使國貨皮革業遭受重大打擊。其次是工資過高，影響生產成本，亦有因此不堪担負而停業者。再决是政府所訂稅率太高，使產銷不暢，成本吃重，高利貸剝削下之三百餘家皮革業，更覺透不過氣來；故希望政府實行三點：（一）能减低稅率，與民生品及棉織業同一課稅；（二）請發放低利貸款；（三）禁止外國底皮進口，提高外貨而皮之進口稅率。</p>
<p>針織業包括絲襪內衣與服裝三種，一般營業均無起色，據該業公會負實人稱：尤其是積機絲據工廠受玻璃絲襪傾銷營業更爲悽慘，致停榮者甚多。至整個針織業遭受打擊之原因，亦不外高利剝削，成本太高，外貸傾銷，購買力薄弱等等同時電力之限制及原料來源問題，亦極困難。農歷年關，大部皆感週轉爲難。惟皆願竭力支持以免影響社會經濟及生產工業，彼等皆希望政府給予低利貸款，然工商貸款迄尙未聞有貸予針織業之消息，同時該業並盼當局能配給原料，取銷電力限制，以增加生產」云云。</p>
<h3>我國戰時損失　約五百餘億美金</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：戰時我國全國所遭受之直接損失，估計總値達美金三百億元，簡接損失估計總値達美金二百億元。至工礦運輸事業所遭受之損失估計總値達美金四十億元。最後一項損失政府最近將派員往日拆遷一部份工業設備，作爲日本對我戰時損失賠款之一部云。</p>
<h3>例風襲漢口　最近一個月內　倒閉商店一千二家</h3>
<p>年關迫近，漢市金融及工商業倒閉之風日熾，頃據漢口市繁局發表，自上月上旬至十二月中旬，漢口共閉商店一六二家，虧損金額共三十一億九千七百六十萬元，內計銀行，銀莊十家，油鹽業四家，服裝疋頭業七家，糧食商行十三家，五金雜貨業廿二家，飲食店二十九家，金銀號六家，營造業十一家，旅棧貨行十二家，捲烟業十家，燃料業三家，理髮業三家，鐘表業二家，海味業兩家日用品業八家，文具業一家，油漆業一家，其他十八家云。</p>
<h3>工礦運輸事業　重估固定資產價值　調整資本辦法　老資本如不加調整　新資本將無法加入</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部次長潘序倫，昨特假經濟部上侮區工商輔導處會議室，招待本市新聞界，公布日前國防最高委員會常務會議所通過之「工礦運輸事業重估固定資產價値調整資本辦法共十項，並加報吿，略稱：關於協助生產事業之辦法，最近政府各關係當局，曾在宋院長領導不，研究方案多起。惟查現時各界對協助生產事業之一般概念，終不外係向政府貸款。然借款日積月累，政府實有不勝負担之苦，而工商業亦正如飲鴆止渴，決非澈底辦法。故本部迭經研討，如何使市塲游資，集中生產事業界。考目前游資所以不願集中於生產事業界者，生產事業景况不佳，固屬原因之一。然老資本如不加調整，則新資本將無法加入。國防最高委員會有鑒於斯，遂有該一辦法之通過，並即付施行。查該項辦法在抗戰發生時，後方即已考慮及之。蓋戰前資本如不重予估價，則將發生下列弊端；（一）帳目不能準確。（二）折舊不能提出。（三）資本不能增加，徒增納稅負担，不無虛盈實稅之弊。故民國三十二年時，後方生產事業界曾請求政府准許固定資產重行估値。惟以考慮及一般公務員之身份，及政府之稅收等問題，卒不果行。茲以勝利後國內幣値仍未趨穩定，故決重定該項衙估辦法。</p>
<p>潘氏繼解釋該項辦法要點其範圍暫以工礦運輸事業爲限。至金融商業，則並不在內。蓋政府有兩項顧慮（一）財政及主計兩部，以爲最近銀行存款，各債權人要求照戰前存款數額加倍償給之問題，迄未獲有定論。今如貿然准許金融業重行估値，則無形中已支持各債權人之立塲。（二）按照辦法第七項規定，無形中能迫使社會上一都現金游資，投資於生產事業界俾便充實事業本身之基礎。然政府決不期望游資集中於商業界，以免助長投機操縱之風。</p>
<p>至增加資本之倍數，現決以經財兩部彙編之民國三十五年全國躉售物價指數之半數，爲計算之準繩。據潘氏估計，民國三十五年之指數，的爲三千五百倍，半數則爲一千七百五十倍，此係計算之最高額，如因此而不易招募新股，仍可自動酌量减低其倍數。惟亦有人認爲該項倍數太少。然潘氏認爲估價太高，將來物價穩定時，反易招致危險。</p>
<p>至工鑛運輸以外之生產事業，如漁農等業，則可適川本辦法第十項規定。惟本辦法另一特點，即以前財部對資產增値，認爲係投資利得，應照章繳納所利得稅。現定依照此項辦法重估固定資產所增之資產價値，特准不認爲所得利得，免徵所得稅與過份利得稅。現該項估價增資規定，以一次爲限。以後終望幣値趨穩，俾不再有所更動。至此項辦法施行後，生產事業界是否因此而得救，則尙需視其他因素之配合成敗而後定，固不能純賴該項辦法也。茲將該項辦法全部條文十項，探錄如次：</p>
<p>（一）工鑛運輸事業，具有左列各款情事之一時，得將原有固定資產，重行估價，以調整其資本額。</p>
<p>一、因受物價影響，致原有資本，不敷營運周轉，須增募新股時。</p>
<p>二、擴充所營事業，須增募新股時。</p>
<p>三、與他組織合併經營，須重行調整資本時。　前項估價增資以一次爲限，並限於民國三十六年度內辦理完竣。</p>
<p>（二）前條所規定之工鑛運輸事業，以業經呈准主管官署登記者爲限。</p>
<p>（三）工礦運輸事業之各項固定資產，除土地外，以其購置時原價，减去截至三十四年止，折舊損耗而得剩餘價。</p>
<p>前項剩餘價，乘三千五年全國躉售物價指數，對購置年同項指數之倍數折半後，而得重估價之最高限額，其計算公式如下：時價。</p>
<p>（四）按照前條第二項規定，所應用之各年份全國平均物價指數，由經濟部財政部，根據政府公佈之統計資料，會同編製，呈請行政院核定後公佈之。</p>
<p>（五）工礦進輸事業所有土地，應按照其所在地地政機關所估定之價額，爲重估價額。</p>
<p>（六）固定資產，經照第三條及前條重估而增値之金額，應全數轉作各該事業之資本，並按照其資本原額，比例分配與各股東，不得折作現金分派之。</p>
<p>（七）重估固定資產價値，調整資本原額之工礦運輸事業，依本辦法爲佔價增資時，至少應按所增估之價値總額五分之一，另行招募現金新股。</p>
<p>（八）重估固定資產價値，調整資本原額之工礦運輸事業，應由其執行業務之合夥人或股東或董事，依法分別提請其他合夥人或股東同意，或提請其股東會依法爲增資之決議，並備具左列各件，呈請主管官署核准。</p>
<p>一，原登記事項抄本。</p>
<p>二，重估固定資產價値調整資本方案。　三，經合夥人或股東同意之證明書或股東會決議錄。　四，經會計師證明之資產負債表，及重估固定資產價値，及增加資本後之資產負債表。</p>
<p>工礦遝輸事業，如爲獨資時，前項呈請，由其資本主爲之　關於前二項之呈請，在公司其主管官署爲經濟部，在合夥或獨資，爲市縣政府或院轄市之主管局。</p>
<p>（九）工鑛運輸事業調整資本經核准後，仍應依照商業登記法或公司法，及其他有關法令之規定，向主管官署聲請變更登記，換頒登記證件。</p>
<p>（十）工鑛運輸事業以外之生產事業，有重估固定資產價値調整資本之必要時，呈經主管官署之核准，準用本辦法之規定</p>

<h3>九十分鐘未開記錄　優游再度和青白</h3>
<p>優游力守不敢青白猛攻不</p>
<p>足聯甲組賽，靑白重逢優游，昨日下午於逸園交鋒，天雖嚴寒，惟陽光普照，故觀衆達六千餘人，情况熱烈，兩隊於第一循環以一比一媾和，靑白雖於錦標已無甚希望，惟爲保持名譽起見，出全力以擊退優游，但結果仍難如願以償，而鴨蛋一對，重行握手言好，上半時李義臣失去十二碼機會，當係不利預兆，優游雖無獲勝希望，然上次能够迫和，固屬幸運，昨賽亦以不敗作自信，理想竟成事實，故優游足以自慰矣。</p>
<p>李義臣　十二碼未中</p>
<p>昨賽由蔣吟僧任裁判，與賽雙方，均乏精彩演出，靑白瞿永福小羅在港未返，阿奎缺席，所補兩翼，新將等於虛設，幸後防堅固，故仍白璧無瑕，優游自知不易直搗黃龍，故守多於攻，九十分鐘常在混亂之局面中過渡，你來我往，各無成就，上半時靑白攻勢甚熾，懶牛數次叩門，均越野而逸，優游拉蒂表演出色，三十三分鐘時，王南珍在禁區衅人，裁判員蔣吟僧判罰十二碼，李義臣主踢，勁頭十足，然爲拉蒂拍出，此球不進，靑白銳氣頓挫，優游反形猖獗，但亦無建樹，上半時零比零，各無所獲。</p>
<p>優游會　傾全力苦守</p>
<p>下半時，優游陣容一仍其舊，靑白前鋒則大事更動，小將經林桂改踢中鋒，李義臣任左輔，宋靈聖任右內鋒，小顧充右翼，而以費春華易出陳慰芝，經此調整後，仍無補於事，優游傾全力苦守，靑白曾得四决角球，但亦一無成就，中途李義臣無意曾蹴中拉蒂小腹，觀衆一時嘩然，幸拉蒂小創即愈，球迷始平安無事，雙方入後，謹愼應付，致未肇事端，而球賽在一來一往之鬆弛情况下，一對鴨蛋終結。兩軍陣容如下；</p>
<p>靑白</p>
<p>秦必高</p>
<p>嚴士鑫　吳祺祥</p>
<p>高保正　孟義良　張鳳崗</p>

<h3>淮南煤礦巡禮</h3>
<p>— 蕪湖二十日訊　本報特派員康風</p>
<p>這兩個地方：大通與九龍崗，如果光臨過淮南煤礦區就可以知道這是兩顆寶石的閃光所在。</p>
<p>民國三年大通煤礦開始了生長，開挖礦二十多口，均未得煤，資金用盡，連幾十名工人伙食都開不成了。創始的商人夏履平曾辦過秦皇島柳江等地煤礦，認定大通可以採到煤的，賣出一根鋼絲繩，（的值數千元）來支持工人伙食，作最後的一擲，終於在這支鋼絲繩變價的伙食維持下觸到了煤層。大通煤礦公司就此募得了股本資金，（二百萬元）資金推動了生產，大通煤產開始了淮南煤礦的歷史，在抗日戰爭前最高峯產量到達一千八百噸一天。</p>
<p>大通與九龍崗</p>
<p>民國十九年，在大通東五公里的九龍崗煤層被淮南煤礦局開採了，胡衛中（當年的警務處長，現淮南鐵路局副局長）說；　「我們到九龍崗的時候，這地方只有六家人家，其中五家半是土匪。」</p>
<p>這麼一個荒村，在民廿六年發展成爲一個擁有三萬人的小小鎭市，另外還有礦路新村，工房區械，淮南煤產最高峯到二千七百噸一天。</p>
<p>民國廿六年冬，日寇逼臨，胡衛中副局長到那時負責做最後破壞礦路的工作，鐵路是由裕溪口逐段破壞到田家菴，（裕溪口爲淮南鐵路終點，與蕪湖斜隔長江，田家菴在淮河南岸，爲起點‘）才嘆息一聲離去。這位貌似馮玉祥氏說話口音也近似的胡衛中在後方八年終於又回來隨同接收這條破毀的鐵路。</p>
<p>八年淪陷中日本人把淮南鐵路變了路綫，掠奪大通與淮南兩個礦塲放在其海軍管理之下；爲了供應日本海軍燃料的節省汽油不濟。道些接辦的日本九州帝大出身技師們用殺鵝取蛋似的手段蹂躪着礦塲，爲了出產多，不惜把許多煤坑弄得採不好久即行拋棄另行開坑浪採，儘管如此，八年來日本人的最高生產量每日都不曾超過三千八百噸，（少於民廿六年兩礦四千五百噸日產量）。　自然八年來爲日本採掘去的煤，其使用效果扼死了無數量的中國軍民，這些煤開動津浦火車去運兵壓平魯蘇皖的抗敵軍民，這些煤開動日本海軍燃煤船在長江及海沿去掠殺我軍民幷運送奪取到手的作戰物資，這些煤的數量總計的爲七百萬噸。這筆債日本人開始在還，但迄今到手的只有窰木廿萬根由日本運來，日本人必需賠償他的掠奪！</p>
<p>（二）帶了四面國旗來接收</p>
<p>張友賢工程師由重慶循着那條民卅四年九月接收路綫，由重慶，芷江抵南京，然後轉道蚌埠，到達九龍崗日本海軍管理的淮南煤礦，他只帶幾個助手，另外他身上帶了四面國旗。</p>
<p>他以爲道地方第一件大事是扯下日章旗，換上八年不見的國旗，殊不知他到了礦塲抬頭一看，比絞繩架（不是絞殺人的刑具，係絞吊礦井煤車用）還高的天空飄的正是中國旗，日本人的恭順，使得張友賢更加小心，唯恐糖衣里暗藏破壞礦井的毒著！</p>
<p>張友賢，在八年重慶，以及貴州生活里就是一個辛勤的礦塲工程師，長期辛勤工作與後方不良的營養差不多毀滅了這個從事礦工二十年的老靑年，所以一到淮南來接收，神經就有點敏銳，到達礦地，他的人手少，而礦地範圍幾達二十公里的直徑，他不能管遍所有的礦井機器設備只好在住所床頭放兩架電話機，門口放一部卡車來控制全局，那兩部電話機一條錢通田家菴電廠，他不能呌電廠出任何一點事情，倘若電廠出了毛病，那礦井里的抽水機停止工作，礦水就會淹沒了礦井，另一部電話通往大通礦塲，他必需控制這產量最大的礦區，隨時注意牠的生存。</p>
<p>不久謝繁綱副局長到來了張友賢的辛勤移了一部份給這位胖胖的北方人，可是，馬上不好久這位胖副局長的血壓就給礦場接收管理弄得只往上昇，一百四十，一百五十昇到一百八十，這半百中年人爲了護衛淮南產業，跟各方來的冷算明槍對抗着，他們的機智手段，自然得到了安全效果，今年一月礦上人手才逐漸補充得以應心的配備使用，到四月二十日，才開走最後的二名日本技師。</p>
<p>除了被掘壞的煤區坑道外，日本人以及預想中的僞軍魔手由於這兩位督察嚴密，毫未損害礦的原貌。但巨量煤的生產在人手漸多的今年才開頭，因爲日本人留下的原不過是百廢待從頭的荒蕪一片！　（本報特約李鳴鵰攝）</p>
<h3>看田家庵電廠</h3>
<p>淮南礦路體系如果稱之爲一個工業巨人，坐落在淮河南岸田家菴的淮南電廠可以比擬爲這巨人的頭腦或心臟。這一天淸晨我被引導來看電廠，這電廠現有一部電機正在轟隆轉動，鋼絲刺綱環衛着這幢裝置電機的水泥鋼骨二層樓建築，樓上是發電機間與配電盤房，樓下裝置爲裝煤機，鍋爐，電帮浦，水帮浦等。這部發電機每天（二十四小時）吃下六十噸由牠的動力助採出的黑飯（煤），再發出二千基羅瓦特的電力用一寸直徑粗的高壓電綫輸送到十公里直徑的礦路區域任何需民的地方去。</p>
<p>這個電廠雖然響聲隆隆，但在里面做工的人只有寥寥數人，全廠連小工不過二百名人手，電氣課長李榮寶，每天在樓上配電盤房隔室坐鎮，這位瘦瘦長長的電廠主腦人物，早年是一個電廠技工，二十年的實際工作與自修研習所得的學理智識使他今日勝任一個電廠廠長而還有餘力。</p>
<p>一部新電機已經運到了電廠樓下空塲地上，這部電機也可發出二千基尅電力，原來是美商答應售給四川灌縣都江電廠的，可是由於淮南煤礦這一年在緊急供應京滬光明之需上大大表現過成績，行政院就給予優先機會來報答這個礦區。其實這部電機也還得花一筆巨資，陪引我的人說，是二十七優先，這當然得在日後這個礦區提供的煤價中擔除，四種方面聽說，原先撥給都江電廠的電機運到淮南煤礦去，大吵一陣，淮南礦上人以爲這些事中樞大概不會偏心的，吵也無用。這部新電機裝成後當然會增加淮南煤產，在冬季侵襲富庶的長江三角洲時，淮南電廠的日夜發電不僅照亮了黑暗的礦區，也把熱力傳到秀麗的江南。　這個電廠在戰前是沒有的，用不着誇耀日本人的成績，日本人在中國所爲者不過酷烈的榨取普遍的民力做軍事工業的累積資本。不用說，可以誇耀的不是日本人成績，而是中國人民的膏血鑄成品。</p>
<p>我看過一下戰前建用的舊電廠，電工們正在折修着透平與渦輪，水銹在鐵片里差不多淤塞了一寸間隔的葉輪，日本人只知道儘量使用機器而不檢查修理，反映出其心理上的暗無前途，殘暴役使物力的秘密，其實這種老電機也該廢棄了，但我們中國的工業化一時不易發展普遍，所以這個舊電廠還要修好供電，張友賢工程師吿訴我除了道個電廠可發一千六百基　電力外，舊大通電廠也還可發電一千　　，淮南礦一部廢棄不用的三百四十五基　發電和轉讓高平煤礦還很得人家的感激，經手工礦的人才知道緊急需用下的機器設備效用，與這些事絕緣的人那裏曉得掛帆滿載的船對風的渴念。</p>

<h3>煤礦井口一瞥</h3>
<p>淮南煤礦現有東礦塲西礦塲，以及分礦塲共三處，東礦塲爲前淮南煤礦公司的礦井所在，西礦塲爲前大通煤礦公司的礦井，分礦在西礦塲附近，礦區裘的人描述礦區煤層宛如一尾鯽魚，九龍崗的老淮南礦井（東礦）是魚頭，大通的老大通公司礦幷（即今日西礦）爲魚背，魚尾巴則是今日已封閉的洞山礦幷。</p>
<p>除了封閉停工的洞山礦井，未曾訪問，在東礦，西礦，以及西分礦我都隨着張友賢工程師去參觀過，我雖然早先也看過江西省萍鄕縣安源煤礦及新喻縣花鼓山煤礦，但在這位老礦師的面前還是惶恐得像讀「人之初」的入蒙學生，提問都不好啓齒。</p>
<p>在西礦的二號幷口，我對着上下對流的鋼絲繩注視着，二號井深一百八十公尺，鋼絲繩一根落下空煤車，一根升起裝滿煤塊的煤車，所費時間爲卅秒，全日工作不停可以吊出二千八百八十四車煤，每一軍煤重〇。五三噸，合一千五百噸煤，這是二號幷井口出煤的最大限額，由於井下工作的繁複，雖然一天三班工人下幷從事採掘煤工，但與一班井口吊出的煤的在四百車到六百車，總計這一口井日產量的七百噸這個井口吊出煤車之後，裝煤的車立即推出吊籃，一部空車立即推入吊籃塡充空位落下幷去裝煤；推出吊籃的煤車由二名工人推在小軌道上，滑到五丈距離的翻籠裏，用翻籠的轉力，把煤車翻轉使煤落在樓下的堆　間的流勵鐘帶上，履帶是寬　　皮製的，統去不停，煤經過戲帶送入驪　朧中，使煤塊與煤屑分他在煤塊　去時，還有工人整天坐於其旁檢出其中的爛木塊與石塊，然後到達一個大儲積閱，經過漏斗注入裝煤的列車車廂裏，運向需煤的地方去。</p>
<p>我自然因爲不曾下得礦幷看望一下坑底下的採煤勞動爲憾，僅只在井口旁，煤屑騰飛在太陽光綫裏就令人呼吸沉重，做一班井下的苦工，肺裏差不多要留下不少的煤　微粒，所以礦工的身體痛古可以說人類勞動生活中最酷烈的一類，在新喻花鼓山的礦幷裏，我自己倣傚礦工的勞動，在肩頸背着筐繩筐子裝了三十斤的煤，從採煤處的三尺高坑道爬向吊煤的昇降機旁，那一筐煤就被我這個狗也似的爬獸拖帶行進，坑道裏是黑暗的，我頸上一盞螢火似的礦電燈照亮了坑道，沒有但丁的神曲煉獄裏羣妖形象，坑這的空氣同裝着冒烟煤爐窄小洞穴，偶爾也碰到迎頭爬來的另一西拖煤的獸。那赤裸的骨骼包一層皮的瘦形軀體增加你在地獄裏的感覺，這就是爲他人供獻光明與溫暖的痛苦勞動，我沒有下到淮南任何一個礦井裏，但我知道，這些礦工不會比新喻花鼓山礦井中人舒適多少，當然，淮南的礦井工程師以及佐理人員也是身受地層下苦工浸蝕着心肺的痛苦正像帶兵作戰的軍官身受戰地苦楚一般，陪引我的工程師張友賢當年下井上來，因爲總是去搶救幷下積水，或起火的災害，所以常在上來時用剃刀片割破馬靴。因爲水的浸泡早把這位地下工作者的腿漲得褪不下緊嵌肉中的馬靴皮筒而必需割裂卸下。　目前由於電力供應不停，井下積水可無問題的及時抽出，所以水災淹死人的事不曾發生過，火災即幷下煤氣爆炸灼傷人的事也未發生過。只是爲濃烈的煤氣所醺悶而窒息者常有，十一月十一日即有二十多工人在幷下爲煤氣醺倒，經抬出救轉未死，馬上六百公尺做辦公室取暖煤爐烟囪的鐵管被移用到這個充溢煤氣的坑道裏送進新風，排洩煤氣。</p>
<p>在一處礦燈室我看到這個礦的組織工作有點像軍營，每一個礦下工作者必需在電燈不達處帶用裝於帽上的小礦燈，這礦燈用乾電瓶供電，這間供燈室共有一千六百盞礦燈，排得非常整齊，不斷的充電，供下一班工人下井前領用。</p>
<p>淮南煤礦由於設備以及用電作助，是一個相當機械化的產業體系，但因爲牠的煤系地層爲八十度以上直下狀的陡坡，所以礦井是直下的，而不能像萍鄕煤礦爲平進的坑道，因此地下採煤處與井道交通不能像萍鄕煤礦使用電車，所以在總的生產成本上，目前淮南煤產雖已由二十工一噸（日本控制時的生產力）進而爲今日五人出一噸煤（三號井產量）但距戰前淮南大通時代的一人出一噸煤水準尙遠，（目前美國礦工工作水準是一人產量四十噸一天，美國煤產那麼豐盛，礦工數量僅四十萬人，當然美國礦塲的高度機械化是主因。）</p>

<h3>中國氣象事業之進展</h3>
<p>— 盧溫甫</p>
<p>氣象學爲應用科學之一科，氣象事業則國防與民生建設之重要柱石也，民國以前，中國氣象事業悉操外人之手，越俎代庖，言之可恥，考觀象臺之創立，實以耶穌教士所設之上海徐家匯天文臺爲最早（一八七三年），而香港與靑島觀象臺，則爲遜淸光緒年問所始創，主其事者，乃英德二國政府，日俄戰後，日人在東三省南部及長江流域，俄人在外蒙及東三省北部，均廣設測候所，邊徼之區，滇藏內地，法英亦有氣象之設備，即沿江沿海之海關測候所，亦尙由英人赫德之之議而始得以成立，當時朝野人士之漠視科學技術，由此可見。</p>
<p>民國肇始，前北京政府敎育部即有中央觀象臺之設，其二年，氣象科成立，是爲我國自辦氣象事業之嚆矢，最初觀測僅限北平一地，後雖曾添設庫倫，張北，開封，西安等測候分所，然至民國十三年以經費拮据，分所均先後停頓，即中央觀象臺本身亦奄奄一息矣，當時該臺及各分所之工作，僅以地面觀測爲限，天氣預吿雖曾試繪天氣圖，然因測站寥寥，難期準確，始終未脫試騐時期。</p>
<p>民國十六年北伐告成，國府奠都南京，氣象研究所成立，直隸於中央研究院，以該所所長竺可楨氏之倡導，我國氣象事業，始得有長足之進步，該所除自設測候所於酒泉，貴陽，上海，寗夏，包頭，拉薩，北平，鄭州，武昌，西安，泰山及峨嵋山外，並供給儀器，訓練人員，協助各方成立測候所，同時各省市及航空水利敎育等機關，亦漸注意及此，决第設立氣象臺與測候所，以應本身之需要，迨至民國二十五年，全國測候所之數已達三百餘所，在技術上，均接受氣象研究所之指導，而觀測範圍，不僅限於地面，且推廣而至於高空，北平，南京，西安，靑島，上海，漢口，廈門，香港，重慶，杭州等地均逐日施放測風氣球，北平，南京與香港並有按時分別以風箏，飛機及探測汽球觀測高空氣象之舉，因地面與高空觀測日趨完備，從事研究者亦日有增加，天氣預吿之成效大著，各地氣候眞相於焉漸明，此於航空航海安全之增進，農林水利之設計，均有極大裨益，固不僅供學術之研討而已也。</p>
<p>自倭寇入侵，抗戰軍興，東南半壁淪陷，舊日心血，半成灰　，氣象研究所播遷入川，以經費支絀，不能從事推進氣象事業，但因時勢需要，民國三十年行政院遂有中央氣象局之設置，從此氣象事業，始有專司，在該局主持之下，西南與西北之測候網組告完成，而氣象研究所亦得以致全力於理論之研究，惟當時海運未通，設備方面，未免因簡就陋，難以盡如人意，勝利以後，中央氣象局役員還都，即努力於敵偽測候臺所之接收與氣象事業復興之籌劃，並擬有氣象五年計劃，以期逐年完成，計劃要點有三：（一）建設全國測候網設置頭等測候所三二處，二等測候所一一九處，三等測候所三五五處，分隸十一區，各測候所均備有無綫電設備，其區中心氣象臺除經常觀測地面及高空氣象外，並每日按時收集各所紀錄，發布天氣報吿，（二）培養氣象人才，設置氣象專科學校，（三）充實儀器設備，設立儀器工廠，自造各種氣象儀器，目下該局直轄氣象臺所凡氣象臺或頭等測候所南京，上海，北平，武漢，定海，肅州，武夷山等七處，二等測候所湄潭，重慶，康定，長沙，沅陵，茶陵，常德，大理，南鄭，陽泉，太原，塘沽，中寗，天津，南寗，石碚，松潘，廣元，揄林，西昌，雅安，祁連山，南充，彭水，酉陽，雷波，達縣，奉節，麗江，玉溪，鎭遠，興仁，威寗，銅仁，安順，羅甸，商縣，華山，三江，富林，等四十處三等測候所西寗，都蘭，安西，拉薩等四處，合計五十一處，均按定時作地面觀測，頭等每日廿四次，二等六至八次，三等三次，此外各省市尙有頭等測候所十九處，二等測候所五四處，三等測候所二一處，過去技術方面雖均受中央氣象局之指導，然以系統不一，重複互見，設備每有精粗之異，現已有由該局接收統籌辦理之議，惟該局本身成立之時，扼於戰時環境，組織狹小，預算有限，欲謀發展，尙有待於政府之注意改善也，中央氣象局之業務的略可分三項：（一）管理全國各級測候所站，（二）收集整理全國氣象紀錄，（三）發布天氣報吿，而尤以後者最爲一般人士所關切，現該局南京本局及其所屬之上海及北平二氣象臺均每日按時收集本國及東亞各地之氣象電訊，繪製天氣圖及高空圖表，據以製定天氣預告及各項警報，交報館與通訊社發表，並由廣播電臺，江海岸電臺及其自備之XQG5（1/2KW，8500KC.）電台定時廣播，每日一次，以備航空海及沿海漁民收聽應用。</p>
<p>氣象學之研究，端賴各地紀錄之收集，民國四年，中央觀象蛋曾有觀測叢刊之發行，至民國十年停刊，此後氣象研究所亦嘗有氣象年報，月刊及高空觀測報吿之刊布，舉凡國內各地觀測之結果，莫不廣爲搜羅，愼爲抉擇，關於歷年紀錄之整理，該所致力亦動，民國廿五年曾編印中國之雨量專刊，所載紀錄，都三五三站，截至民國廿二年，並附有全年及各月雨量分佈圖，總達五百餘面，偉為巨觀，抗戰以後，復有中國之溫度印行，其內容與編次。悉同前書，勝利蒞臨，該所又有中國氣候資料出版，凡三卷，包括各地民國卅年以前雨量，溫度，濕度，雲量等項平均與極端值，內容豐富，足備參考，中央氣象局，成立以後，對歷年各地紀錄，搜羅亦博，按旬出版旬刊，每年印行年報，最近且更有中國氣候圖集之鉅製該圖集計有氣壓，風向，溫度，雨量，濕度，雲量，日照，霧霾霜日等分佈圖九十六幅，繪製精審，實爲從事農田水利等建設計劃必備之典籍。</p>
<p>國內純粹之象刊物，以氣象研究所集刊，中國氣象學會氣象學報與中央氣象局氣象叢刋為最要，此外各大學地理，或航空研究所亦時有專刋或叢刋之印行，氣象研究所集刋為國際性之刊物，多用英文寫成，現已出至第十三卷第三號，氣象學報原名氣象雜誌，介紹與專著並重，論文皆附以英文提要，該刋十卷以前為年刋，十一卷至十三卷為月刋，十四卷以後，以印刷困難，又改為年刋，現已出至第十八卷，中央氣象局叢刋發刊於民國三十四年，不定期，大體年出一卷，卷爲四期，第二卷第三期，近已問世，中國氣象學之研究，就已發表之論文而論，多集中於天氣及氣候問題之探討，理論方面者較少，此蓋因實際需要而致之也，近年以還，因氣象事業日見開展，氣象敎育亦大有進步，各大學理學院地理系多附有氣象組，而中央太學及淸華大學且有氣象系之設立，但投考者不多，畢業生年僅數人，殊不足以應需要，尙希國內靑年，立志科學，投身斯道，庶此關係國防與民生建設之事業，得以迅速發展，而奠定國家萬年不拔之基也。</p>
<h3>揮淚話封邱（下）</h3>
<p>— 開封十九日航訊　本報駐汴記者王瘦梅</p>
<p>陳主任說：「他腦筋中除了國家民族和軍事計劃以外，另外便是「克己」兩個字，精神上，物質上，這兩個字的確支配着他的思想行爲，因此地從來沒有和別人爭過功名利祿，沒有和上級與部下發生過任何誤會，上級對他厚也好，薄也好，賞也好，罰也好，他都誠心接受，絕對服從，決不會不滿意或疑惑上級的，上决他聽到中共新華日報社論上替他鳴不平，他僅付之一笑。對友軍，對部下，他也是一樣，誹謗也好，誤會也好，他都以實際的行動來解答別人的誤解。他的私生活很簡樸，我知道他今冬以軍裝太貴，拆了一件舊大衣，才改製成了現在身上的一套軍裝，其餘的我就不知道了」。陳主任邊想邊說，好像也帶點羞澀的神氣。</p>
<p>「謝謝你，我對孫將軍的訪問工作已經完了。」我笑着感謝他</p>
<p>「那不行，你在無意中做工作，我可不能負責任！」他笑着說</p>
<p>風雪朝會</p>
<p>十七日早晨，我們這一羣過慣顚倒生活的報人，爲了參加朝會，破例六點鐘就起了床。天有不測風雨，昨天風和日麗，今天却風雪交加了。陳主任冒着風雪來請我們到會塲去，在風吹雪打中，我們走向會塲（那是廣大的曠堪），一陣巨雷似的掌聲，我們被送到了升旗台前，我回頭望望，那黑壓壓的一片，北邊是軍隊，中間是公務人員和學生，南邊是民衆，後邊是行將出發的砲兵，台上站着一位主席，他是中心學校校長，（朝會——升旗是從五綏靖區到封邱後，發動封邱黨政軍學民衆各界，每晨七時聯合舉行的，主席是各省首長輪流担任。）雄壯的國歌聲唱完之後，大家敬着禮，鮮豔美麗的國旗，在悠揚的軍樂聲中，升到了風雪的天空。</p>
<p>幾千人的復興操開始了，這是我們在開封向未看見過的蓬勃活動。</p>
<p>「除土匪！」一肅淸貪汚！」「發展經濟！」「注重敎育！」「扶植正氣！」「建設新封邱！」四十分鐘後，這幾個口號結束了朝會。</p>
<p>這裏也要照像，那裹也要照像，我們天天選擇鏡頭的人，反而成了人家的鏡頭。</p>
<p>傾聽武事　九點鐘時候，我們到了五綏靖區司令部，孫司令官和董副司令官送我們進入招待室，滿牆都是軍用地圖，有紅圈圈，有藍圈圈，有箭頭，有小旗，看去頗新鮮奪目。賓主坐定之後，那位訥於言語的孫司令官，說話了：「各位先生如果想明白本綏靖區當前形勢的話，現在由我們胡參謀長和各位報吿一下。」接着胡參謀長站了起來，他先把五綏靖區由豫南調到豫東和上月在封邱。滑縣。東明。濮陽。濮縣一帶經過的戰役，作了一個綜合報吿以後，然後他沉痛的說：「本部八九年來，先與敵人作浴血戰鬥，繼與共軍作自衛抵抗，現仍為國家統一而不能不忍痛防禦共軍，全體官兵，都是非常難過的，目俞我是絕對服從中央停戰命令，按兵不動，不過共軍始終燃燒着戰火，時時想捲土重來的，你看看目前的形勢，你就知道他們的野心了。」說着，他向第二處的一位科長拿着一根敎鞭似的長竹條走向地圖前邊，他像地理敎員似的講授開始了：「本綏靖區，在共軍方面是劉伯誠之冀魯豫邊區的第四軍分區，這個區域裏，共軍擁有地方團隊二十五個團，分在東明屬之壩頭集和滑縣屬之八里營一帶盤據。另外其主力有七個縱隊，在陽穀，朝城一帶駐紥，不時向我國軍進攻……」他一面說着，一面用那根細長的竹條指着地圖。</p>
<p>胡參謀長又站起來補充着說：「共軍是不會忘記這塊土地的，他們隨時都想再把這一塊土地塗上紅顏色，但這個夢想，由於廣大農民慓於戰亂的恐怖，永遠不會實現。今年元月共軍擄去他們九十多個婦女，這筆恥辱的血債，他們永遠不會忘記。他們迫切的希望，是在安定中生活，在生活中謀恢復他們舊日的安樂，謀求取今後之進步，而不願以現實的血肉鬥爭，寄其命運於渺不可及的幻境。基於這種覺悟，他們認爲必需嚴密組織訓練，才能配合國軍確保身家安全，他們已經够苦了，但他們在極艱苦中，需要組織起武裝自衛的力量，本部政治部針對需要，經將全縣八個鄕鎭，編爲八個自衛大隊，一百二十個保自衛中隊，九千零二十二名自衛壯丁，各級幹部均由在鄕軍官担任，每一鄕鎭派一政治指導員，會同縣自衛總隊所派軍事督練員，利用民暇，每日分區集訓二三小時，旣已受訓兩小時以上，彼等對武裝保衛家鄕，維持地方治安之認識與技術，已粗具基礎。「政府的武力」，「人民的保障」，『國軍的助手」，他們都可勝任。我們希望這塊土地上的人民　這樣安居樂業下去，更希望各位先生多多指導，使我們有所遵循！」</p>
<p>哭訴聲聲</p>
<p>孫司令官一席盛宴吃了一個多鐘點，一點兒沒躭擱，我們就到縣政府參加地方各界的座談會。順便我一個人到看守所內看了一看，這一座看守所，小得可憐，只有五六間房子（就是連縣政府也小得可憐，據說原來的縣政府被日寇和共軍拆了，現在的縣政府原是一所民房。）分做兩個屋子，共押有七十多個犯人，殺人案和遊雜部隊佔多數，那些很少經過判決面被覊押着的囚徒們，見記者進去·連呼「委員開恩，趕快給我們判決！」我沒有法答覆他們。就退了出來。到了會議室的時候，座談會已經開始了半天，劉縣長已經報吿完畢，省參議員王法平先生正揮淚呌苦，他說：「封邱原是個先天不足的五等縣份，經過八年多的蹂躪，共軍幾次的摧殘，已經是民窮財盡，精疲力竭了，而目前大軍雲集，供應浩繁，地方民力實已不能支持，老百姓爲了活命，需要軍隊保障，有了軍隊保障，他們却無力活命，他們願罄其所有，供應困難的軍隊，但他们却無所有了，原來十五萬多人口現在只剩十三萬人口的肩上，幾個月來担負了三〇五，二七五，〇四八元的各種派款，和一五六五，〇〇〇斤糧食，還有九百一十二套棉衣，三百三十四套棉大衣，他們因各種天災八禍而損失的總數是一六，八七八，二二二·〇二五元。這個沉重的負担數字，放在淹淹一息的病人肩上，那是他們無法忍受的，但大家多數都還在軍民合作與同情軍隊的立塲上，咬牙忍受着，他們無力繳燒柴，已經在拆自已的房子當柴火送了，因爲現在五綏靖區的部隊都很好，老百姓雖然苦，但他們不忍使軍隊沒柴燒。有些地方眞是忍受不下去，他們就忍痛「交牌」（把門牌交了，他們就逃亡異鄕），交的多了，就形成了「塌保」，（保成了空的，就像這一保陷落了一探）所以：在封邱境內你不會見一付笑臉，你也聰不到一聲唱「路戲」的，大家都在悲慘的嚴寒中等待着救濟，等待着减輕負担。　劉議長和商會會長都有使人下淚的哭訴，使記者不堪回憶，不忍重述！　又是下午二時，我們戴負着這里的光明和血淚，吿別了封邱，返回開對。</p>

<h3>蘇省政府　農業改進事業</h3>
<p>— 季君勉</p>
<p>一個史的回溯</p>
<p>江蘇省的農業改進，歷史悠久，民國初年，即有農商部第二棉作試騐堪之創立，而省立造林塲，蠶桑塲，麥作試騐塲，及雜穀試騐塲，相網成立，以領導改進江蘇省之農業。惜乎軍閥弄權，政治不上軌道，經費支絀諸影響，未能發展，雖有學者，專家如鄒秉文及故張嗇翁諸先生之提倡，終未能發揚。</p>
<p>北伐以後，江蘇省政府有農鑛廳之設，廳長何玉書氏，頗具辦事熟忱，延聘專家主持，如棉業專家孫玉書，及園藝專家陸費叔辰諸先生，均曾爲蘇省農業建設費過心血，確定各塲所之業務，並確籌其經費。</p>
<p>省立漁業試騐塲亦於斯時成立，並有魚輪捕魚以示範。</p>
<p>蘇省墾植事業本蓄有重要性，過去向未爲農業行政當局所注意。自農鑛廳成立後，始有墾植事業委員會之設置，聘請專家及極墾團體之代表人聯合組織之，商討墾植事宜，此爲本省行政機關注意墾植事業之濫觴。</p>
<p>推廣方面有推廣委員會，以策劃全省農林畜牧魚業蠶桑之推進。</p>
<p>農業改進與推廣，縣級機構原極重要，然一向均被忽略。在北伐完成以後，蘇省之各縣農塲普遍設立，在濱海有魚鹽之利的縣，兼成立魚業指導所。經費爲事業之母，省府又規定，徴收農業改良捐，作爲縣農業改進之經費。此期更有兩種特色，一即縣農塲之負責主持人，必經過廳方考試，始能委任，並不隨便更易能任用眞才使工作者安心。他一種即行政屬縣，經費之支用，絕對受縣方之監督，事業之進行，直接受應方之指導，僅報縣備查而已。蓋礎漸固，頗有朝氣。縣塲業務，因地制宜，分別爲第一主業，第二主業，與副業。以推廣爲主，保種及繁種爲輔。這期可算江蘇省農業改進最上軌道的黃金時代。</p>

<p>農業改進之成效，原不能立而待。必須細針密縫，邁步前進，在江蘇省農鑛廳時代，僅將基礎固定，初步計劃完成而已。若假以時日，循序前進，必有成就，惜乎不久，省府局部改組，農鑛廳併入建廳，省塲一度停頓，縣塲改爲農業推廣所，仍有數縣保留魚業部門，但徒在名義上變換，實際落空，更不若昔日之有條不紊。且無印信或鈴記，行政全不能推動，不像機關，不類團體，農業改良捐，又併入建設金庫，成爲縣建設經費之一部，不能獨立，應用時便難免無小困難。常局希望雖切，終以組織不健全，缺乏全盤之計劃，僅成强弩之末，幾不能保持前期之光輝。</p>
<p>惟本期之中畜牧事業，較諸前期爲有進步。選擇蘇省出產猪羊有名之地區，分別與中央種畜塲合組猪種保畜實騐區，或畜牧實騐區，改進猪羊種。歷史較淺，但對於畜病之防治甚多貢獻，養猪養羊者頗憑其惠。此爲本期特色之一。各縣魚業部門，（似已無漁業指導所之名義，僅附設於農推所中。）紛紛設法從實際示範着手，造船買網，以便實行捕魚，並冀自給，不仰賴於公幣之挹注。此爲本期特色二。棉業方面除原有之省立棉塲外，復有江蘇省棉產改進處之成立，前者注意試騐，後者注意推廣，分工合作，範圍頗廣。中央棉產改進所，並予以合作，事業成效，尙有表現。此爲本期特色三。</p>
<p>勝利後：人民正期待着</p>
<p>日寇侵境，政府西遷，全省農業魚牧機稱，全部停頓，或助作抗戰有關事項。勝利一年後之今日，全省農事機構尙未全復員，省立塲所，雖有形式上恢復者，實則經費之支細，事業無法展開，使主持者灰心，期待者失望。畜牧部分仍在保管期間。至縣級機稱更談不上事業，或隨縣府辦公，或則成立以後，缺少經費，無事可做而撤消。</p>
<p>淪陷八年以來，農村被敵僞壓榨。慘極，痛極，勝利一年後之今日觀之，猶百孔千瘡。非從速救濟復興，不足以舒農困。不過如何才能走上舒困孔道，非負行政和農業職責者之共同努力，難期厥功。——過去有特色的制度事業，都是今日之師，並且更要緊者，即在切中時弊，不尙空談，才有補乎實際。</p>
<h3>失業的原因</h3>
<p>— 皓</p>
<p>失業之原因很多，學者研究，分爲偶然，個人，社會，政治，經濟五種。</p>
<p>（一）所謂偶然之原因者，爲天災人禍兩種。（一）天災如地震水災火災旱災及颶風等。（二）人禍如國際戰爭國內戰爭。</p>
<p>（二）所謂個人原因者，例如智力體力，道德欠缺，疾病，殘老職務等的特變，皆足以致勞工於失業。</p>
<p>（三）所謂社會原因者，乃失業之原因，歸咎於社會。簡言之，約有六端，即財富不均，土地獨得，人口過多，缺乏組織，缺乏訓練缺乏介紹是也。財富不均則普通人購買力薄弱，資本因而停滯，工廠因爲倒閉，土地獨專，則地主得任意操縱，以作不生產之投機競爭，致勞農無地可耕，又組織缺乏，則勞工與雇主間之誤會，雖得具體和解，工人間亦未克有互助之舉。又如缺乏訓練，則勞工因之學習職業技術之機會，即無精密之技能，雖勉强從事，勢必耗費材料，出品不良，銷路不廣，工廠收縮。其結果即使勞工被雇主解僱。</p>
<p>（四）所謂政治原因者，如勞工無法律之保障，工商多苛稅之重負。</p>
<p>（五）所謂經濟原因者，則較爲複雜。因勞工原屬經濟生產要素之一。茲歷舉十二項如次：（A）因經濟循環期之變遷，致工商業由盛而袞，其結果使勞工失業BB）工業之進化及變遷，則因舊式工人每因不適於新異之機械而致失業，（C）季節工業勞工，因其工作之定期而致失業，（D）工商業不得準確消息，以致供需不應營業失敗陷工人於失業，（E）濫用信用制度，輕易借款，凡稍獲利潤者羣趨摹仿，以致生產過剩而勞工失業，（F）工時過長工作不適，以致工人勞工過度，報酬遞减，出產不良，營業受損，而勞工失業，（G）同業之競爭過烈，互相傾軋卒至生產過剩，或遭顚覆而造成失業，（H）兒童就業過早，致　喪身體，至年老時不克工作，而致失業。同時則壯健者被童工之排擠，而陷失業，（J）原料缺乏使工廠無從製造，而致勞工無業可就，（I）幣制混亂，致物價易於趨漲，工業界因生產過剩，致停閉工廠，而致工人失業。（K）投機事業過多使市上金融緊縮，信用動搖致工商業衰落工人失業。（L）階級鬥爭之說興，而勞資間易起糾紛，或同盟罷工，以要挾廠方，或停閉工廠而遺散工人，致工人又有失業之機</p>
<h3>興築金甌鐵路</h3>
<p>— 乃人</p>
<p>精通我國東南與西南最重要的幹綫——浙贛鐵路，現正在積極興修中，東南與西南的交通不久可期暢達了。</p>
<p>因而使我們想起了一條似乎應該即刻興築的路綫，即是金華商會建議的金甌鐵路，此綫的興築可以說是增加了東南一條重要的動脈，也可以說是賜給浙贛路最有力的輔助，在台灣已經復歸我國版圖的今日，不論在國防上經濟上都不容我們忽視興築這條路綫的重要性。</p>
<p>金甌之間，原有公路於戰時已拆毀净盡，勝利後雖已修築一部份，但大部份尙未興修，至於甌江也僅是一些民船的航行，實難負荷今後的重任。</p>
<p>以永嘉爲起點，經靑田麗水而至金華，與浙贛路相銜接。永嘉至麗水一段沿甌江而上路綫似無問題，但麗水到金華的一段究應經宣平縣境過武義而至金華，抑過縉雲永康而至金華，似尙有商榷的必要。因爲前者地勢比較平坦，而原有公路却是經縉雲永康的，至於在永嘉更可以延畏至瑞安平陽，甚至於到福州廈門也無所不可。</p>
<p>富庶的溫州於光緒二年便開爲商埠，總理於實業計劃中定爲三等漁業港，工商繁華，農產豐盛，漁業更是異常發達，他如平陽的明礬，靑田的　礦，武義的戴石，與農業及國防工業都有很大的關係，皆有待於此鐵路之興築有助其開發與內運也。</p>
<p>溫州距台灣很近，坐船不一日便可到達，興築金甌路是使台灣與內地聯繫最好的途徑，以便控制台島而鞏刮國防，問時台米，台糖，樟腦，石油等亦可由溫州轉運金華而內銷各地，使這「福爾摩沙」（美麗島嶼之意）與內地在經濟政治以及文化上打成一片，不再一直是特別行政區了</p>

<h3>改進紡織工業</h3>
<p>— 榮德馨講　尤懋銓記</p>
<p>申新二五紡織廠總工程師榮德馨先生自美返國曾在中國紡學庚辰同學會發表演說，特爲摘錄要點如下。今天承各位同學的熱誠招待，使我感覺無限的高興，現在我隨便與各位談談。</p>
<p>由學校求得一種專門知識，再入工廠實地去做，一定要經過種種的困難，纔能得到的結果，這便是可貴的經騐。所以祇要各人能認眞的去埋頭苦幹，就可得到充足的經騐。</p>
<p>人事千頭萬緒，錯綜複雜，所以應付人事就比應付技術困難多了。尤其在我國的紡織工廠，人事更複雜，在同一組織下，會生出許多許多的派別，所以應付人事更困難。當我們應付人事時，必定須要先根據各方面實際情形，決定一處理方針。同時在任何環境下，最要緊的還是第一要認識整個環境的演度；第二適應整個環境的趨勢，在這樣情形下，細心相機應付，經過一相當時期，纔能從事改造環境的旣定步驟，實施改進的計劃。</p>
<p>我在中央人事訓練所受訓時，恭聆蔣主席闡明政府抗戰是軍事三分，政治七分，應該觀察國際大勢，決定政治途徑，在七分的健全政治，配合三分的健全軍事，方能攻必克，戰必勝，所以我國在蔣主席英明領導之下，依照上述的方針，纔獲得這空前的最後勝利。</p>
<p>我們服務紡織的人，尤其在目前我國紡織廠情形下，應付人事七分，技術三分。我們每個人雖已認識現在工業建設的重要，但是我們要明瞭建設應該從每個人的心理開始，完成「心理建設」。同時事情無論大小，處置應有」至誠」「至公」的精神，希望大家具有共同一致的精神，發揚我國紡織業的光大前程。</p>
<p>我在美國的時候，曾到一個工廠研究實騐所去研究，有許多試騐儀器是我在國內未見到過的，由此可曉得學問技術無止境。總而言之，不進則退，應該急起直追，站在技術的最前綫努力，各位除在工廠實地苦幹外，還要多多在學術方面求進，人格和身體方面修養，處世方面學習。</p>
<h3>互商管理概論</h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>人事管理的各種問題　勞工的問題</p>
<p>關於勞工的問題，隨着所製造的貨品而異，通常貨品愈精巧，那末所付的工資也較大，向來一般製造廠對於勞工問題，並不十分注重，所以工人們時常更換工作的地方，祇要那一家工廠能够付較多的代價，就到那裏去工作，這種情形，其實對於製造廠方面是很不相宜的，因爲一則熟練的工人，一旦離開對於工作不無影響，二則每一個工廠多少有一點商業上的秘密，如機器的式樣，裝置的情形，和生產的情形，以及工作的情形，都不宜給同業知道。</p>
<p>所以現代的人事管理，應該能够做到下列的幾點：</p>
<p>一，能够雇用適當的工人，二，能够使工人安心工作，三，能够使工人的服務時期增加，因此人事管理也成爲一種專門的學問，要使企業組織發達，對於人事管理部分的工作必須健全</p>
<p>人事管理工作與生產工作</p>
<p>從前有一句俗語，說：「購買的工作做得完善以後，等於做了一半的銷售工作，」這句話的確是含有至理的，因爲如果我們所用的原料是最上等的，而代價又是非常公道的，那末我們可以製成價廉物美的貨品，在銷行方面的當然可以便利得多，就是可以收事半功倍之效，一個製造廠裏，對於購料方面，需要精明而合理地辦理，對於勞工的雇用，原則上等於購進一批原料，因爲勞工的工資也要列入貨品的成本的，而且勞工的問題，比原料更爲重要，因爲購買原料，祇要看對貨樣，鄭重檢查，就不會有什麼問題，雇用勞工以後，還需要不時去督促，使他們不會虛耗時間，去鼓勵他們，使他們有更好的工作成績，因爲工人們如果虛耗了時間，就要使生產效能减低，間接影響成本，减少利潤，所以勞工的問題，對於生產方面，有很密切的關係，要使生產工作順利地進行，產生良好的成績，勞工問題的確是值得注意的。</p>
<p>人事管理與管理部份、</p>
<p>關於人事管理，旣然非常重要，所以人事管理部分，就不能由一個低級的職員去擔任，人事管理的範圍很廣，因爲一個企業組織中，除了總經理經理廠長等由董事會聘任或兼任外，其餘的職員，都需要聘請或雇用，聘請或雇用就是人事管理的第一步工作，如果由一個低級職員主持，而聘請的是一個比他較爲高級的職員，那沒爲了職位的關係，要施行人事管理的一切實施，就要感到困難。</p>
<p>所以負責主持人事管理方面的事宜的人，必需是一個重要的的職員，以前我們曾經提出組織人事管理委員會的方法，實在可以說是從合理想的，因爲組織一個委員會，凡是各部主任都可以參加，這種方法可以使各方面貢戲實際的情形在決定某種措施以前，可以作爲參考，預先可以知道將來實施的時候有沒有困難。</p>
<p>這種人事管理委員會的辦法，可以產生下列的效果：</p>
<p>一，擬訂各種章則的時候，可以得到多方面的意見，事前知道實施的時候，有沒有困難。</p>
<p>二，企業組織的各個部分可以得到同一的待遇，決不會有互相參差的地方。</p>
<p>三，在發生人事方面的問題，如勞工提出的要求等，可以具體地應付。</p>
<p>四，因爲是一個具體的組織，所以使全體職工對於委員會所定的鞏則，容易服從。</p>
<p>在人事管理委員會裏，當然要有幾個辦事員，去辦理日常的事務，如統計，記錄，各種抄寫分發等事務。</p>

<h3>談幾種寫劇的方式</h3>
<p>— 丁伯騮</p>
<p>「寫劇是沒有一定成規可循的。」這是易卜生說過的一句名言。就他自己說，從他手中所產生的一些作品，的確就沒有完全用一種固定不移的方法。</p>
<p>但假如我們試把一些劇作家寫作的經騐下一番歸納的工夫，却又不難看出：雖然他們不承認有一定的下筆的途徑，可是總離不開幾種方式。</p>
<p>一種方式是先有一個命題（作者以其生活體騐中觀察中所孕育成的觀念，做一種提示或提議），然後再選用適當的人物適當的情境來做作者之思想的圖解。這一種方式是近代劇產生後所常見的一種，把社會價值和藝術的見解統一起來的作家，常常就是以這樣的步驟着手寫作的。用這一方式完成了作品的作家，成就的固大有人在，失敗者亦復不少，因爲他們所安排下的人與事，往往太邏輯，太槪念，太說敎……使得劇中的人與事錯綜的程度旣不够，深度也不够，凸度也不够。</p>
<p>值得做爲這種寫作方法之例證看的，還是借重易卜生吧。雖然上面說過他用過的方法不止一種，可是就這一個方法說，他也可以供給我們一個很好的例子。</p>
<p>五十歲以後的易卜生，日常的生活成了固定的一套習慣。在兩個年頭裏，他構思，他搖筆，每一個第二年正月的第二個星期內總有一部新作發表。一部才完成，他隨即籌劃下一部的寫作。差不多是用一整年的工夫孕育他所要寫的命題，人物，和情節；然後再以第二個整年的時間不斷地寫不斷地改。每天，他在同一的時間走進那去慣了的咖啡館，在坐慣了的座位上坐下，翻閱報紙，從報紙的上端窺視那些過來過去出出進進的客人。在家中，他很少同誰說話，對太太與兒子也沒有例外；他是個孤僻成性的人。家人深知他的脾氣，誰也不麻煩他，也從不問一問他正在計劃或正在寫什麼戲，因爲經騐已經吿訴他們，只要等那第二年正月內第二個星期到來，就可以讀到他的新作了。</p>
<p>他是一個非常珍惜原稿的作家，連最初的草稿都不像別的作家那樣棄之不顧。在他逝世以後，許多原稿都意料不到地被發現了。那些白紙上留下了他在寫作過程中思想之來蹤去跡，給後之研究易卜生者遺下了莫大的方使</p>
<p>當易卜生五十歲時，那是一八七八年，他小住羅馬。一個晴朗的下午，他接到一封信，瞥了一眼就塞進了衣袋，接着就出外散步了。他正在街上走着時，一個思想突然湧出，他立刻停了步，就把他所想到的東西在那信封的背面記了下來。這個信封至今還得保存着在，留在上面的文字，使我們窺探到了一個偉大作家寫作上的秘密。</p>
<p>那字跡開頭是——一一八七八年十月十九日，羅馬。」另一行像一個小標題——「悲劇的資料」，接着寫道；「有兩種道德律，兩種意識：一種是男人的，另一種屬於女性，他們彼此不知，而在現實生活中女人行爲是被男人的規律來衡量的，好像她們是男子而非女性。（——這已經是個完整的命題了。</p>
<p>隔了些日子，他又這麼寫下去：「劇中的妻子因爲沒有是非之見而遭遇不幸，天生的感情和人爲的權威使她昏亂。」</p>
<p>「一個女人在現社會裏是不存在的，因爲她們是生活在一個男性的社會中，這個社會裏的一切規律是男人制定的，審判女性行爲的司法完全站在男性的觀點</p>
<p>一」</p>
<p>「她犯了僞造罪，但她却自以爲榮，因爲她愛夫情深，她得挽救他的生命。然而丈夫呢，却用世俗的觀念站在法律這一邊川男性的眼光來看這問題。」</p>
<p>看了易卜生留在信封上的這許話、再想一想他所有的作品，熟悉於他的作品的人，立刻就會想起：這不正是「傀儡家庭」的大綱嗎？是的，那一個名劇就是用道個在散步時所得的命題發展成功的。</p>
<p>讓我們再談另一種方式吧——從構想人物或一羣人物開始而後發展爲一個戲。</p>
<p>漢米爾敦說：「假如我把一些人放在一塊，假如我以足够長的時間注意他們，他們說的作的都會給我很豐富的編劇材料的。」這是個有力的啟示。</p>
<p>我們仍不　從易卜生留下的文件中我尋實例。</p>
<p>在他計劃寫「海姐」的最初的備忘錄上，他寫過道樣簡短的文字：「灰白的，冷若氷霜，艷如桃李。」從道話中完全看不出有何有意義的命題，而且也不是一個完整的句十。繼而這短語後面加上一個短語了：「渴望生活中偉大的事件或生活的樂趣。」但仍然呌人看不出含義何在。跟着，添上更完整的話語了：「那男女終於勝利了，他外表平庸，却是個可敬的，天資聰穎的，愛自由的科學研究者。」至此，忽然接上了一句對白：」海姐說——我對於任何事沒有興味，祇有厭煩。</p>
<p>他是用這些零碎的材料構成一　高樓大廈的。</p>
<p>威廉·阿契爾（Willam　Acher）大概不同意着樣寫法。他說：即以「海姐」而論，他看不出來從劇中人身上可以找到作者所要提出的任何命題。</p>
<p>這實在是有點故意吹毛求疵；無論如何，在道部戲裏，易卜生並未因爲自人物下手而遺忘了一個作品的靈魂——主題。試想吧，劇中這位女主人翁——海妲的不幸，何嘗不是由於易卜生眼中所見的社會原因？她是本質極好的女人，如果換一個好點的生活環境，　會成爲一粒光彩耀人之寳石的，可惜她沒有，正相反，她生活於一個錯誤的世界上，錯誤的國度裹，錯誤的城市，錯誤的家庭中，因而她毀了別人也毀了自己。道部戲正是易卜生另一個對社會所下的挑戰書，說「海姐」沒有主題，未免寃枉了。</p>
<p>平內羅（Arthur　Pinero寫作的初期，許多批評家常說他的作品沒有顯明的命題，使他非常苦惱。他曾對那些批評家抗議，他說：「我的冀圖就在用人物或一羣人物，把眞實的社會狀態展開在舞合上給人看。假如批評家要從它裏面捕繹出什麼格言之類的玩意來，那是他們的事，而我是並沒有從一個什麼格言着手寫下去的……」這自然是氣憤話，實際上，假如平內羅的作品眞「抽繹」不出什麼命題來的話，那他早就會失去其在藝術田園裏的光彩了。</p>
<p>所以，儘管從人物設想看手也是一種寫，可是也絕不是說可以沒有主題而仍是一個完整的作品。</p>
<p>再要說的一個方式，是從構思一個極動人的情境着手寫一個戲。比起上述兩種來，這個方式也許容易些討巧些，但道一個方式的嘗試不是沒有條件的，要有豐富的舞台經騐，劇塲經騐，熟悉觀衆的心理，方能知道什麼才可做爲「動人約有戲劇性的情境」。</p>
<p>這一種方式之最好的例子，應該從薩都（Victorien　Sardou）的成績中去找尋。他極信服亞里斯多德所說的「動作是戲劇基本因素」的那句話，也極信服雨果說過的——「戲劇的動作用感情表現比用理智易臻成功。」所以他所計劃的情境，就着重在以刺激觀衆感情的「動作」來制勝。他的成功，另外有個幸運的遭遇，那即是在他的事业展腿開之際，有那麼一個第一流的女演員做了她成功的支柱。她呌SarahBernbard。在她的表演技術中，有三件特殊的技藝為別人所不能學得的：一是用呌鴣胡似的聲音表達一種誘惑意味的感情，一是用烏鴉似的聲音與人爭辯，另一就是表演死亡之前的聲音。薩都就利用她的長處編了許多適於她演的戲。在別人看來，那些戲自然是各不相關的，其實呢，不過是這位女演員換了不同的服飾罷了；每一個戲的中心人物，都不過是作者以她爲對象而製造出來的。</p>
<p>這一種方式，大致說來最適宜用以寫作喜劇，允適宜於寫作閙劇。</p>
<p>就說不以這種方法着手寫劇吧，對於一個劇作者言，平時留意戲劇性濃厚的「情境」也是必要的，因爲不論如何寫，旣然寫的是戲而非其他文藝作品，那就得重視一些重要的情境而增　效果上的收穫。否則，所寫出來的就不免會成爲專門訴諸聽覺的文學作品，而不是「以訴諸視覺成分爲車」的戲劇了。</p>
<p>最後要說的一種方式是——劇作家可以把他在某一時間某一地點，某一境遇下偶被激起的感覺意識地捕捉住——把這類隨興隨滅的感覺捕捉住而翻譯出來，這也可以發展成一個戲的。名劇作家霍甫特曼的「織工」，就是以道種「路子」寫成的，而「騎馬下海的人」，尤爲此方式之傑出的例子。據格里歌列夫人說，後者的作者Synge所以要寫這個戲者，就是要把在阿蘭島（Aran　Islands）實生活中所感覺的氣氛搬到舞台上來給別人也感染一下。自然，他是完全成功了的。</p>
<p>不管是什麼方式吧，爲了獵取材料，都得記住一句話，那即是「時時張大着眼睛，活動着關筋，緊緊地面對着現實的生活。」</p>
<h3>海湼詩</h3>
<p>— 廖曉帆譯</p>
<p>姑娘呵！當我們都是孩子。</p>
<p>兩個又快活又稚氣的孩子；</p>
<p>我們時常爬進鷄棚，</p>

<p>我們裝着雄鷄那樣地啼呌，</p>
<p>人們打那兒走過，</p>
<p>『唧唧咕』！他們都認爲這</p>
<p>確是雄鷄唱的情歌</p>
<p>天井裏的那些木櫃，我們裱</p>
<p>糊了它的板壁</p>
<p>我們在那裹面同居，</p>
<p>裝飾成一間雅麗的寢室。</p>
<p>鄰家的那隻老貓，</p>
<p>時常來這兒拜訪，</p>
<p>我們敎它如何打拱，叩頭，</p>
<p>和如何問候健康。</p>
<p>自從我們認識了它，</p>
<p>就樂意向它說逍說那</p>
<p>如以前對許多老貓關心過的</p>
<p>那些零碎的話。</p>
<p>我們規規矩矩地坐着談心，</p>
<p>和那些大人們一模一樣。</p>
<p>而傷逝着我們這一代</p>
<p>一切美好的事物變成感慨。</p>
<p>「愛情，信義和眞誠</p>
<p>到處都不再存在，</p>
<p>祗是咖啡的價漲得更高，</p>
<p>而会幣又日漸稀少。</p>
<p>兒時的樂趣呵已經消逝，</p>
<p>一切都變成了另一個樣子，</p>
<p>金錢，世界和年成，</p>
<p>眞誠，信義和愛情。」</p>

<h3>辭歲草</h3>
<p>— 胡膺東</p>
<p>一、</p>
<p>寒風料峭，陰雨綿綿的聖　節活做是蒙上了一襲經紗的老年人，當我踏入這大都市的熱閙區，眼看人流車海的奔騰，撥指數點這歲尾的日子，心地上覺得有點匆匆的感覺，是的，我在這都市裏討生活，應該有一年了。歲暮抒情，感集萬千。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>時間原是無情的，眼前的生活則顯得格外的無情，在這雨霧輕拂的聖　節，我原沒有什麼感想，要有的話，也是些極其平凡的，因爲，像我這樣一個平凡的人，不會有特出的生活，因此，畫出來的供狀，連自己都不敢逼視。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>在現實社會裏，我是個低能兒，我息着智識份子十的蒼白病，自己的筆尖裏無形中會流露出不健康的意織，生活如此，寫的東西不會積極，說我新傷感主義，我該坦白地承認它。</p>
<p>生活在小圈子裏，天地是狹小的，偏偏自己的臘子又有點腫脹，看不慣現實是事實，不能正視現實也是事實，這矛盾的根愈陷愈深，牢騷自所難免，祇怪自己的修養太不到家，心胸又不大，推不開，解不開，我的生活與寫作便陷入這個泥淖裏。</p>
<p>泥淖裏的日子帶住了我，我希望能掙脫這個覊絆。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>人活着一分鐘，他的希望還是跳躍的，問題是在這個希望是編排得架空的，遺寔朝向有光彩的一面的。</p>
<p>我挾帶着希望，漫步於生的道路上，一年，一個不算短的日子的考騐，令我感到這與希望依然是如何的遙遠。</p>
<p>自己艱苦地生活在這都市裏，出賣最最廉價的靑春，像耕牛一樣地工作着，不問晴暑風雨，我總得背着十字架，走進那個青春的屠宰塲去，接受那個剝削者的精神刑罰，興趣與生活分了家，這是我深深地感到窮苦的事。</p>
<p>一年，就在這種慢性的剝削裏，輕輕溜過。</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>我對於未來，存在着一種單純的奢望；我祇希望自己能够勇敢地觀脫精神上的鐐銬，抖下一身的不健康的意識，追求我的興趣，跟有興趣的一個生活的側面擁抱，在這裏，我伸出熱情的渴望的手，希望更多的朋友和我相互勉勵，引導我，熱情地哺育我。</p>
<p>過去的，該化爲陳跡，未來的，等待着人的力量去發掘，這裏讓我畫下一筆供狀，我希望前面不再是猙獰的刑塲，更希望自己不會在泥潭裏塗上一身子的汚漬。</p>
<p>站在一歲之尾，我傾訴過去，眺望明天，我的心向着向善的海洋流去，在風雨重霧之中，我憧憬着光風霽月的境界，常然，這之間，免不掉用僅有的生命力去搏鬥一塲。</p>
<h3>短篇小說的特性</h3>
<p>— 復君</p>
<p>在西洋文學中，所　小說（Flction），包括三類：（一）Novel，（二）Novelette，（三）Short　Story這裏所飾。許多人往往把Novelette和短篇小說混為一談，事實上Novelette是Novelette，短篇小說是短篇小說，全爲兩事，不是一件東西。這正如有些人以爲Novel與Short　Story的分別，要在篇幅的長短而已、是犯同樣的錯誤的。目前許多文藝刊物，都有短篇小說和長篇小說的分欄，如果我們細加考察它們的內容和章法，有些編者和作者實在並沒有把這兩種東西的分野弄淸楚。</p>
<p>我們知道約十九世紀中葉以來，世界文學的趨勢，莫不由長趨短，由繁多而趨於簡要；因爲工業革命的結果，人類的生活競爭日益緊迫，對於時間的觀念也就隨之格外覺得寳貴了。所以在文學方面的詩，就很少有荷馬，密爾頓，但丁那樣幾十萬字的長篇，大家都在競作短的抒情詩（Lysical　Poetry）。在戲劇方面，像莎士比亞的Hamlct那樣長至五齣二十幕的就很少了，漸漸變爲五齣五幕，再又變爲三齣三幕，最後又由三齣三幕而演成「獨幕劇」。所以在小說方面，也是由長篇而演變到短篇，以至目前這樣盛極一時的時代，也就不待言了。</p>
<p>短篇小說的創造者美國文學家愛倫坡（AllanPoe）說得好：「在短的小說上，作者可以把他的企圖，十二分地展開。所以在誦讀的時候，讀者的靈魂，却被作者所支配，而絕無倦怠或中斷之事。」實在的，短篇小說所表現的只是一件事情，一個塲面，或是一種心情，它不描寫人生或社會的羣像，只是描寫了它的一小部分，甚至僅是一個小小片斷而已；但是經過短篇小說作家的靈巧的手腕，「讀者的靈魂，却被作者所支配」了。我們一讀優秀的短篇小說家如愛倫坡·莫泊桑·契訶甫·奧亨利等的作品，他們有他們各人所具有的獨特的技巧，以各種不同的姿態和風格，在短短的篇幅中，捉住了人生的一斷面，用他們華麗的文筆，努力地描寫人們不注意的細微的事情，使我們讀了之後，無不爲之神迷。這就是短篇小說不同於長篇小說的地方，也就是短篇小說的特性所在。</p>
<p>當前我國文壇優秀的短篇小說作家固並不乏人，但是有很不少約有希望的作家，總往往爲了受不住生活的逼迫，企圖多獲得一點稿酬，把一個很可以製成完全精緻的短篇，不惜奮力渲染、盡量拉長它的篇幅，竟至就演成了一個長篇小說了。其結果，當然是空虛，無力，蕪雄，甚至無一讀的價值。而相反的，有許多很偉大的題材，正可以好好地加以有條理的組織，完成一個長篇的小說的，竟又以限於作者的時間和精力，或竟是文學修養之故，又變成「不了了之」的短篇小說了。前些年文壇上喧鬧着『偉大文學作品」這一問題，有一小部分人竟以小說篇幅的「長」「短」來決定文學作品的是否「偉大」，這也實在是太天眞的說法了啊！</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血137</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>從破曉之前，鶴見在安坂鷄塲發動計劃以來，野猪傳達了各式命令之後，圓子擔任內綫動作，她的行動，已經成了這計劃鎖鏈中最重要的一環。直到晚上八點半左右，鶴見動身上飛機塲時爲止，還收到過一次報吿。但是最重要的報吿，應當是在晚報第二次號外，登載那封短簡之後。鶴見十二分的需要知道別府對於這封短簡的反應別府由各門部的動作，近衛是否得到報吿，假如得了報吿之後，他的態度如何等等。</p>
<p>但是鶴見如何能獲到這個報吿呢？他們未嘗不能假借一種名義，發一個無綫電給飛機山的鶴見；從飛機下來當口，也似乎可以安排呌野猪上機塲來，傳遞一個消息；在參謀本部，鶴見有好幾個「〇」字頭的手下，擔任着內綫工作，似乎也可設法傳遞一個消息；再不然，鶴見本人，在參謀本部，進見秘書室值日官之前或後，也似乎可以借辭打一個電話，向安坂或其他預行佈置的所在，探問探問；最後，秘書室命令鶴見乘原車上別府晋謁近衛，當中的一段路上，應該預先有一個傳遞消息的佈置。這都似乎十分可能。</p>
<p>然而鶴見爲什麼沒有想到這一點？以鶴見的諜探學識，和手下這些精明强幹的脚色，那種縝密精確的思考力來論，豈能不推想到這一點？這個報吿旣是婦此重要，鶴見二度晋見近衛的這段戲，應當怎樣唱，就應當根據這個報吿來決定，却究竟爲了什麼關係，而不預先佈置一個傳遞消息的辦法呢？爲什麼把這最重的一段時間，造成了一個靜默期使鶴見斷絕了聯絡？</p>
<p>殊不知道，造成這段靜默期，是一個大學問，是一個絕頂聰明的佈置。國際的大間諜們，在一種大計劃發動之前，往往就要製造一個靜默期。這個靜默期最大的作用，就是替主體行動人，把一應「嫌疑後果」的危險，减除到零度以下。換句話說，在計劃發動之後，其結果或成或敗，主體行動的脚色，始終能保持「淸白」，任何嫌疑，牽扯不到他身上。</p>
<p>鶴見是發動這個大計劃的主動中心人物，毫無疑問；但在他出塲的這一段上，他始終表演出自己一切是被動的，是在莫明其妙的被人愚弄着，而這個愚弄的背後，是一個精密的大計劃，並且表現得十分突如其來，呌這樣精明的鶴見，也來不及發覺，而墮在牢籠之中。</p>
<p>誰都知道，東京是一個間諜和反間諜網佈置的神經中樞。那佈置種種間諜網中的幹部和鷹犬，無風三尺浪，無事都要生事，何况鶴見這次突然回來，在他們心目中，是個問題人物。縱然近衛表示了進一步的羅致鶴見，至少那第五縱隊，應當與鶴見合作起來，應常放棄敵對的監視，但事實上却不是這麼一回事；因爲兩個不同的問諜團體，絕對沒有合作的可能，要有也僅僅限於互相利用一下罷了。這，可以知道，鶴見如要保持沒有嫌疑，至少從他上飛機塲起，應該與自己的團體，絕對絕緣；讓任何特務團體，抓不着一絲把柄。</p>

<h3>責任</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>截至昨晚為止，中國中央兩航空公司三架失事的飛機，已死亡者，已有七十人。尙有十一人在醫院裏待醫治、</p>
<p>這幕慘劇，無論如何，航空公司應該負責任，交通當局也應該負任。這責任分做兩方面的：</p>
<p>一·敢底查究各機未能安全降落的原因，如果在設備方面，設備方面爲什麼不完善？爲了今後旅客的安全、對於這方面應該立刻設法改善。</p>
<p>二·據公司聲稱，死者每名發給撫卹金一百萬元，這筆數目太不成話說了，一百萬元能作什麼用？公司應該就各死亡者之身分等等負責賠償損失的。</p>
<p>世界民航史雖然短促，迄今已近四十年，這四十年中，我們尙從未看到在同一天內有三隻飛機在同一地區失事的紀錄，所以有人說聖誕節三飛機失事，雖然發生在上海，可以說是全世界第一件大新聞了。</p>
<p>我們現在靜待交通當局和航空公司對以上兩點給我們一個交待。</p>
<h3>冰山雪海，爭捕鯨魚　蘇日捕鯨隊開往南極</h3>
<p>— 魯純父</p>
<p>據麥帥總部天然資源局宣佈：日本開往南極的捕鯨隊，已共獲得鯨魚五十餘頭。莫斯科報紙稱：「蘇聯亦有捕鯨隊一隊，計共九艘，及大型供應船一艘，開往南極」。看來，杳無人跡的南極，又因捕鯨而騷動一下了</p>
<p>南極是個極寒的地帶，終年埋在冰雪卞，巍峨的冰山，四處飄浮，除了探臉家以外，是沒有人去的。但因盛產鯨魚，是世界捕鯨的最好地帶。英國科學研究會會員雷納曾在一九三四年十月間，往南極探查鯨魚蹤跡，漂浮洋面凡七月。據其回來後的報吿，鯨魚多至日見二百尾左右。因此，世界各國，都不肯把道天然富源輕輕放過。</p>
<p>戰前，在南極捕鯨最努力的是英國和挪威。每年的漁期，必有十幾艘捕鯨船出發，德國丹麥和日本雖然也曾躍躍欲試了好幾决，但總敵不過英挪二國。而現在，日本人靠了美國人的提携撑腰，却居然也在南極耀武揚威起來。</p>
<p>不易捉</p>
<p>因爲鯨魚體重力大，慣在洋中掀風作浪，所以捕捉非常不易，著名的捕鯨專家史溫特方稱，他曾用鋼叉刺殺過一尾長達九十五英尺的鯨魚。蘇聯的一個捕鯨者曾在西伯利亞海外叉着了一尾鯨魚。牠把船拖着在海中走了七小時，速度每小時八海里，繩子一共長三千英尺，船跟着牠總不能趕上。以是，捕鯨若不得法，自己的性命也會就此送掉。</p>
<p>這是一個英國專家設計的銀行經理的辦公廳。</p>
<p>捕鯨業的開始，約在一千年前；直到本世紀，各國一拼命捕捉，但鯨魚繁殖遲緩，像這樣捕捉下去，很有絕種的危險。然而也正因大家都知道捕鯨業是行將終結的行業，所以各國捕鯨的公司，都定下「趕快儘量捕獵」的辦法，以期爭先獲得最大量的收穫。</p>
<p>大搏鬥</p>
<p>鯨魚性情好玩，牠常常會和捕魚船作追逐之戲，牠在船的四周浮上沉下，游來游去，有時這樣的玩了兩三個鐘頭，玩得厭倦了，擺了擺尾巴，揚長潛泅而去。如果捕鯨者不予以驚擾，牠不大會傷人，但如果漁人拿鐵叉刺着牠敏感的肉，牠便機智地泅躍出和漁人鋼叉威力所及的範圍，然後和漁人搏鬥。所以要捕牠，必須看準了牠，予以致命的一擊，否則全船便有極大的危險。</p>
<p>一九三七年有位熟於捕鯨的科學家J.Perno發明了精巧的捕鯨方法，他們先在三百尺高的山上，建築了一個無棧電台和瞭望台，用最精密的望　來　察　面浪花的起處，決定館魚蹤跡，如果發現了，短波的無綫電台立即以火熖閃示在沿海山崖下的捕鯨船，那是再以最輕捷的飛機引擎發動，和短波無綫電指揮的高速率捕船。這時候，鯨魚又必湧現在距捕鯨船約半里附近，向海面調換新鮮空氣。於是，捕鯨船即急速向魚身駛近，在船上的魚叉砲射程以內，同時，甲板下的掌砲者即裝上裝彈，（此種砲彈能在發射出八秒鐘後，自動爆發。再隔五分鐘，當鯨身再在船附近出現時，即疾馳近前追捕，同時砲手把砲身旋向魚身，向鯨魚腹部襲擊，鯨魚受痛，潛入海底，但因魚叉頭炸藥的自動爆發，仍把鯨魚送出海面。</p>
<p>大砲轟</p>
<p>這時，砲手便把電叉射入鯨身，而在它身後拖着條導電的綫索，然後掌舵者把電綫連結電機，導入電流，於是，海面上一聲悲鳴，浪花四濺，捕鯨船駛上再放最後一砲，以防鯨屍再沉海中，這海上的科學戰爭，就在數分鐘內吿終。這辦法現已爲各國普遍採用。</p>
<p>目前，又屆鯨魚的魚期，南冰洋的寒流中，蘇日等國又爲捕鯨而競爭了。目前世界，眞是沒有一片土地不充滿着國家之間的爭霸和矛盾！</p>
<h3>點鈔雜談</h3>
<p>— 陸士雄</p>
<p>近聞中央銀行將招考許多點鈔員。</p>
<p>當這張令人神往的萬能紙——鈔票——的孕育時期，也須經過幾次三番的管敎，初次是審看大張，包括：油墨的顏色，印刷的技術，和紙張的部位，等等。其次是檢看號碼或官章等有否錯誤或漏印。再决是點核張數。上面的工作，在我國往往是操由年靑的姑娘們辦理，因爲女性比較心細，所以每一鈔券，尙未漂流到市面前，光須經過女性的多决染指摸索。當人們擎着一扎簇新的鈔票時，或許會洋洋得意地認爲『初人我手』的可愛，其實它們已經飽嘗胭脂粉氣，並且是屢經女性管敎的奴隸。在這裏我又想起美派尊重女性的習慣，任何事情是Ladies　first，論到通貨孕育的簡史中，也是適用女性第一！祖任此種工作的呌女點員，也許是新鮮的職業和名稱，她們的敎育程度，自初中以至大學不等，她們是靈活的一羣，必須手快眼快。方可勝任愉快。</p>
<p>鈔票是盡人所愛，有鈔可點，雖然「焚膏繼晷」或「節風沐雨」，都可不懨不惓的。但是我想祇有點鈔員和女點員，由於他們或她們日坐鈔城，終日與此爲伍，自然會感到見鈔生懨，甚至頭痛，這原因還在『爲誰辛苦爲誰忙』而僅做着『過手財神』的美夢罷了！</p>
<p>翻開舊書看看，在「列仙傳」上有『點石成金」和『聞見後錄』有『點鐵成金」的神話，在近代的貨幣學上似應加上『點紙成金』的新例，在我們淸苦的公敎人員一羣中，則唯有『點金乏術』和「新年缺乏點綴」的痛苦沉悶。</p>
<p>話又轉過來說：同樣的一張鈔票，它的命運和身價大有不同，譬如一張二千元的票子，在富貴人家，家財以「億」位計算，此區區二千元，隨便給乞兒也不算慷慨，但在窮苦人家，它可購幾升米，買幾斤菜，每當用去一張二千元的票子時，必先撫摩一番，如慈母之與愛子，依依不忍別離！分開以後，還是很捨不得它呢！</p>
<p>曾記得美國一位經濟學者R.M.Sauille，對於圓的價值，有所論列，他也有相似的看法，他說：究竟一塊錢值多少？這完全看這塊錢落在誰的手裘，並當作什麼用途：</p>
<p>在有固定收入的主婦手裏，一塊算是一塊。</p>
<p>在沒有固定收益的寡婦，要等於九塊錢的價值。</p>
<p>在不能生產的老年人，等五塊錢。</p>
<p>在有遠大前程的靑年人，也許祇值三角。</p>
<p>最後筆者以爲富貴人的性命，窮苦人的鈔票，孰輕孰重，抑或比等，是否也可點查一下。</p>
<p>（按：此爲「是誤殺的嗎」一文之答案，該文載昨日本刊　，那是沒有星，沒有月亮的黑夜。五英哩路之外才有人跡，所以不可能有燈光，在黑暗中，任何動物的眼睛不會發光的，除非有可以反射的光錢；至於人類的眼睛則無論在怎樣的環境下，決不會發光的。</p>
<p>所以白德婁決不可能在黑暗中看見任何所謂發光地注視着他的眼睛。（不信，你可以在晚上關起燈來試騐一下。）很明顯的，那是件故意謀殺案！</p>

<h3>混水摸魚之徒</h3>
<p>— 張季皋</p>
<p>抗戰勝利後，聯總運來了大批的救濟物資。冷落好幾年的楊樹浦碼頭，突然的熱閙起來。改行入年的跑洋船者，又活躍起來了。茶館是他們會議的地方。這個碼頭是我的，那個碼頭是你的。勢力範圍劃好之後，各人招來了弟兄。一聲起運令下，成百的搬夫，灣着腰，流着汗，把堆積如山的物資搬到岸上。他們的工資是論天計算的，一天的工資應付一個人的生活是足够的；假使是有家眷的，那就不大寬裕了。但是碼頭上的工作仍被認爲一件好差事。這之中當然有他的原因。只要我們留心的話，我們可以看見搬夫們，每人都穿了一件舊大衣。現在天冷了，披一件大衣不算希奇，可是在一兩個月前，他們也是如此裝束，所謂「奧妙」也就在其中了，大衣別有用處，可以想見。</p>
<p>工作完畢，是回去的時候了。大批的罐頭；猪肉的，牛肉的應有盡有；千百袋的麵粉堆得好像一座小山。這當然是一種誘惑，揀了幾聽大的，向腋下一夾，眞有工夫，大衣向身上一披，大搖大擺的走出去，誰也看不出他們帶夾帶。若是有一夭輪到搬麵粉了，那他們眞是高興極了。工作完畢時，很快的打開一袋麵粉，倒了一半在預先備好的袋袋裏，向兩腋下一夾，就混了出去。</p>
<p>日子久了，當然是會露出破綻的；於是被岸上的××捉去了幾個，但是不久也就大家通同了。他們在出口處放了一個火油空桶。夾帶的朋友出來了，帶罐頭的就送罐頭；帶麵粉的就抓一把麵粉，一會兒桶內已經滿了，於是再換一個空桶。</p>
<p>船上守貨艙口的經常是兩個美水兵，他們是不大聞問的。後來閙的太不像話了，於是抓住了幾個人，關了一夜，第二天也就放出來了。</p>
<p>至於幾個搬夫的頭兒腦兒，他們是坐享其成的。小弟兄們要天天孝敬的。他們眞是「有美皆備」，天天上茶館，有時開一聽菊花淡奶，開水一冲，加上方糖，眞是自得其樂！</p>

<p>「現在我到電影院中去。」仇萊在俱樂部中，對霍達耐敎授說：「我希望你去和約翰叔叔談談，和他消磨一個晚上。最近，他好像很憂愁呢。」</p>
<p>霍達耐敎授一個鐘頭之後，到了仇萊的家中，發現男僕正在手足無措的狀態中。</p>
<p>男僕說：「先生，的翰先生在一個鐘頭之前，要我端了咖啡進去之後，便把自己鎖在書房中了。現在我敲敲房門，他郤並沒有回答我。」</p>
<p>兩個人用力撞開了房門，發現的翰先生躺在地上，身旁是一隻毒藥的空瓶。書房前陽臺的門是開着。霍達耐經過了一番詳細察看之後，便回到家裏去了。幾個鐘頭之後，仇萊走進了他家的客堂中。</p>
<p>「我想在回家之前，到你這裏來，稍作逗留，約翰叔叔是不是看來很憂愁呀？」</p>
<p>「你的叔叔，已經死了。服毒而死的。你的男僕和我發覺他躺在地上。但是，已太遲了，救他不醒了。」</p>
<p>「多麼可怕啊，霍達耐敎授！爲什麼書房的門是鎖着呀？你知道嗎？」</p>
<p>「我也莫明其妙。你的男僕在你家中工作得長久嗎？』</p>
<p>「好幾年了。」仇萊回答說，雙手摔住了他的頭。</p>
<p>「啊，有了這樣的一筆遺產，現在，你可以發財了。』</p>
<p>「那有什麼呢？約翰叔叔對於我，是比世界上所有的錢要好得多了。」</p>
<p>『我希望我能够相信你這句話，」霍達耐敎授回答着說，同時他指着仇萊手中神經緊張地捏着的戲院槳根，說：「僅祇依靠這個，那是證據不足的。」</p>
<p>聰明的讀者，仇莱怎麼會引起敎授的疑心的？</p>

<p>偶爾一二小時的失眠，最好別把它當做一回事，第二天自然而然地會安之若素的！反之，它將會益形纏綿地，傷害着你的神經。</p>
<p>神經衰弱之益形嚴重，大都由於你把它看得嚴重；由是，互爲因果，終至不可收拾！</p>
<p>有許多方法似可以治失眠，但都是無用的；像數數目字等等方法，都只足以使你想着：「呀，怎麼還不入睡呀！快些睡着吧！」殊不知，越是要强它睡着，越睡不着。</p>
<p>最好的方法就是；不要睬它！你閉住眼睛，總會睡着的！你這樣地自信，就行了，切不要暴躁，多疑，或者起床散步；你必須具有決心：躺臥到睡着爲止！即使躺了一夜。（事實上沒有那回事。）這樣子，即使是屢夜失眠，都可安然過去，不久，失眠之魔，便逃走了因爲他知道你是一個强者，它不能加重你的神經衰弱！</p>
<p>其實，只要白天稍有運動，睡前不寫文章，不高談闊論，是不會失眠的！文華</p>

        <h1>1946.12.30</h1>
<h3>Report on Administrative Measures by the Executive Yuan; Political Review Conference Held; Government Reorganization Still Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] Song Ziwen, Weng Wenhao, Jiang Menglin, and heads of various departments are scheduled to report on administrative measures and exchange opinions to the National Assembly representatives of the Kuomintang at the Ministry of National Defense at 4 p.m. on the 30th, conducting a review of political work.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] With the completion of the new constitution and the closing of the National Assembly, all eyes are focused on the reorganization of the government, and rumors abound, most of which are premature. It is reported that the government, through Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Qun, has contacted various parties to solicit opinions. Members of the Democratic Socialist Party will go to Shanghai one after another in the coming days, planning to meet separately before the New Year, and a broader meeting is scheduled to be held in Shanghai on the 2nd of next month. Attendees will include more than just members of the party's central committee. The scope of discussion will include not only internal party issues but also negotiations on participating in the government. At the same time, the Youth Party will also hold a gathering, with the location yet to be determined in Nanjing or Shanghai. The meeting will also decide on the opinion of participating in the government. After the two parties make decisions, they will exchange opinions once again before making a concrete proposal to the government. Generally speaking, the issue of government reorganization may take some time to materialize.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] Xu Fulin, Yang Junming, Hong Shaozhi, and others of the Democratic Socialist Party left Nanjing for Shanghai at 8 a.m. on the 29th. Xu told reporters before his departure that the completion of the new constitution represents a major step forward in China's democratic politics. Going forward, with gradual progress, if the government achieves transparency and incorruptibility, then the warlord-style separatism will naturally disappear. He has exchanged opinions with government officials on the reorganization of the government many times and has also spoken with Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Qun. The Democratic Socialist Party suggested that the government first draft a reorganization plan and then solicit opinions from various parties and social elites. Wu and Zhang have expressed their agreement with this and will relay it to the government for consideration and proposal.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] Lei Zhen is scheduled to return to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 30th.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Various leaders of the Democratic Socialist Party in Nanjing have come to Shanghai one after another. Xu Fulin arrived on the evening of the 29th and went to the party headquarters on Yuyuan Road to rest. Yang Junming came with him. Jiang Yuntian arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 28th and went to Fan Garden on the morning of the 29th to meet with Zhang Junmai to report on the process of participating in the National Assembly. That night, he took the night train to Nanjing and then to his hometown in Anhui Province, where he will rest for about a week. It has not been decided whether he will stay in Nanjing to expedite matters or return to Shanghai immediately.</p>
<p>After Lei Zhen returned to Shanghai, he met with Zhang Junmai again on the morning of the 29th and decided to return to Nanjing that evening. There are widespread rumors in the city that Zhang Junmai has agreed to Lei's request and will go to Nanjing in the coming days, but Sun Xianyi, a spokesperson for the Democratic Socialist Party, has denied this. Sun told reporters, "Whether Mr. Junmai goes to Nanjing or whether the Democratic Socialist Party is preparing to participate in the government has not yet been decided." The Democratic Socialist Party will hold an important meeting in Shanghai in the near future to discuss its attitude towards the current political situation.</p>
<p>Jiang Yuntian then told reporters: "Now that the constitution has been passed, how to formulate the relevant laws and regulations such as the presidential election law to be formulated later is indeed an important issue. Participating in the drafting of the constitution in the National Assembly is quite different in nature from participating in the government to formulate such laws and regulations. The formulation of such relevant laws and regulations is inherently closely related to the implementation of the constitution, but if opposition parties participate in the legislative completion because the relevant laws and regulations are formulated by the Legislative Yuan, then the constraints they are subjected to will be different from those in the National Assembly." The reporter then asked whether it was possible for opposition parties to maintain their opposition status while participating in the formulation of these laws and regulations. Jiang replied, "This is the current crux of the matter."</p>
<p>Jiang avoided answering directly about the current situation, only saying, "There is no way to talk about the constitution without a ceasefire." However, regarding the prospect of peace talks, Jiang believes that "it is no longer a matter of contacting the Communist Party again for peace talks. If peace talks or running around were useful, then a solution should have been reached long ago during the previous peace talks."</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Zuo Shunsheng arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the morning of the 29th. In the morning, he visited Zhang Junli at his residence, but because the 29th was the anniversary of Zhang's wife's death, Zhang had to go to Zhenru to bury his wife, so they did not talk much. Zhang then returned to visit Zuo in the evening to exchange views on state affairs. Zuo is scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 31st.</p>
<p>Regarding the rumors of government reorganization, Zuo said that it is still in the negotiation stage. The government is indeed determined to do this, but whether opposition parties participate in the government is different from individual participation, and there are many issues to consider. Zuo said that after the constitution is passed, how opposition parties participate in the formulation of various "subsidiary laws" derived from the constitution is an important issue that should be resolved as soon as possible. Although there is still a year before the date of implementation of the constitution, next year is actually a very busy year, and the government should schedule in advance and complete various preparations on schedule: for example, building an auditorium that can accommodate more than four thousand representatives for meetings is also one of these preparations.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The leaders of the Youth Party in Nanjing, such as Zeng Qi, Chen Qitian, Yu Jiaju, etc., will come to Shanghai in the coming days. Also, Zhang Qun will also come to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The CCP Holds a Cadre Meeting; Decides to Abandon Peace Talks and Establish a Separate Government; Instructs Party Members to Continue Armed Struggle</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 29th] According to reliable sources, the CCP Central Committee held a high-level military, political, and party cadre meeting chaired by Mao Zedong starting on November 12th. Attendees included Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, Liao Chengzhi, Ren Bishi, Peng Dehuai, Lin Biao, etc. The important resolutions included: (1) unanimously supporting Mao Zedong's leadership for the CCP to fight to the end; (2) abandoning peace negotiations with the Kuomintang and establishing a separate government; (3) strengthening air force power; (4) enhancing propaganda efforts internationally and secretly organizing CCP branches in countries such as Britain, the United States, and France; (5) blockading various cities and collecting materials, concentrating them in its occupied areas; (6) implementing a comprehensive militia policy to strengthen guerrilla and counter-movement combat capabilities.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xulin, 29th] In order to rectify the increasingly fierce factional struggles within the party, the CCP Central Bureau recently issued an order, the content of which is to lavishly talk about military victories to prove the correctness of Mao Zedong's line. Regarding peace negotiations, it emphasized their hopelessness and instructed its party members that "the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference can never achieve peace, and armed struggle cannot be stopped for a moment." "We must negotiate during fighting and find excuses to fight during negotiations." Stopping armed struggle now is equivalent to surrendering to the "enemy" and "selling out the proletariat," thus proving that "only Mao Zedong's thought and line" is the way to implement the "goals of the Marxist-Leninist line." After propagating Mao Zedong's thought to strengthen the faith of its party members, the order also instructed its subordinates to "strictly guard against and eliminate the activities and deception of a small number of counter-revolutionaries within the party to consolidate the foundation of the Communist Party." This order proves that not only can we deeply understand that the Communist Party has no sincerity for peace, but we can also know the brutal style of Mao Zedong's faction in eliminating dissidents.</p>

<h3>British Newspaper Comments on China's New Constitution; Praises the Fair Attitude of the Chairman; The Democratic Spirit of the National Assembly is Especially Noteworthy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 28th] "The Scotsman," a major newspaper in Scotland, is the only British newspaper to comment on China's constitution-making. The newspaper stated that the content of the new constitution is more democratic than previous constitutional reforms. The unanimous passage of the constitution by the National Assembly shows President Chiang's own aspirations are increasingly realized. Since the defeat of Japan, the leadership of Asia has been handed over, and the leadership of Asia seems to be a victory for China, which can quickly put its country on track. Judging from China's constitution-making, it has been able to guide India, because democracy can begin to build a country of Kang and Zhang.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The London Times wrote a review today, welcoming the completion of China's new constitution, and praised the National Assembly for completing the constitution-making work in a short period of six weeks with the word "noteworthy," because it is not easy to reach a consensus with such a large number of representatives. The newspaper also stated: "Although the Communist Party did not participate, the National Assembly is still an impressive meeting. Representatives from Mongolia, Xinjiang, and the Northeast attended, which is a manifestation of the Chinese people deciding their own destiny, and the process of constitution-making has shown the democracy recognized by the Chinese people." The newspaper then praised President Chiang's fair attitude in constitution-making, and stated that the Kuomintang's role as caretaker will eventually end. China now needs expanded political life, and only through mutual competition between new and old parties can there be expanded political life. The newspaper then compared Sun Yat-sen's Five-Power Constitution with the current new constitution, stating that the former's proposed government organization is a "balanced and meticulous organization," while the latter is "simpler and more feasible." In any case, in terms of wording, the system established by the new constitution allows all free-minded people to participate without feeling dissatisfied or difficult. The newspaper also pointed out the advantages of the new constitution, such as the fact that all political parties have equal status in law, that all ethnic groups have equal status, and that personal freedom and other aspects are particularly noteworthy. Finally, it stated that the government will now redouble its efforts to reach an agreement with the Communist Party.</p>

<h3>CCP Uses River Dams for Construction, Obstructs Closing the Breach in Every Possible Way; The Shandong Provincial Associations in Jinan Pathetically Plead</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Jinan, 29th] The Shandong Provincial Associations in Jinan reported that the Yellow River Inspection Team and the Huayuankou Closing Bureau were shot at by the Communist army while inspecting the river downstream from the Bian River, forcing them to turn back. The reason the CCP did this was because the dykes they built were all war projects, and they were afraid that the inside story would be revealed, so they obstructed the team's mission in every possible way. However, the provincial associations believed that if the downstream dykes were not restored, and the breach at Huayuankou was not closed before the next month, then eastern Shandong would inevitably be submerged, and millions of people would be buried in the bellies of fish. Therefore, they again represented the downstream residents and sent a telegram to Zhu De, Mao Zedong, and Liu Bocheng, asking them not to use the river dams in order to facilitate closing the breach. The telegram was moving, and among it there was the phrase "The Yellow River is dangerous, please do not use it lightly, otherwise the land of joy will be submerged, and it will be difficult to make it a liberated area, and the people of Shandong will be fed to the fish, and there will be no source of labor." It was unbearable to read.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 29th] Since the stone quarrying machine, car, and gasoline of the Lue Wangfen Stone Factory were destroyed and burned by the Communist army on December 9, and many employees were captured, the Henan Provincial Council believed that if the CCP did not stop obstructing the closing work, the breach would be difficult to close before the ice jam, and even after the closing, it would be difficult to prevent further destruction and create several new flooded areas. Therefore, they telegraphed CCP representatives in Nanjing, Dong Biwu and Wang Bingnan, requesting them to forward the telegram to Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, asking them to remember the suffering of the people in the flooded areas, order their subordinates to provide assistance, and immediately release the captured employees.</p>
<h3>More Than Eighty Habitual Thieves in Shenyang Station Arrested; The Theft Wind in the Station Swept Away</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Shenyang, 29th] The robbery gang formed by habitual thieves in Shenyang Station has plagued merchants and travelers, which is shocking to hear.

<h3>The Labor-Management Dispute Was Resolved Last Night; Nanjing Newspapers Will Resume Publication Today; The Increase Multiple is Still Under Final Negotiation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, December 9th] The labor-management dispute of the 14 private newspapers in Nanjing was resolved between the two parties at midnight on the 29th, and each newspaper decided to resume publication. The solution is as follows: (1) Salary increase: increase by 40% from December, and 50% from January (it is said that this point is still under final negotiation). (2) Year-end bonus issue: For large newspapers, 2 million yuan will be distributed to workers, and for small newspapers, the amount will be reduced by half.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] The 14 private newspapers in Nanjing failed to resume publication on the 29th after the labor strike on the 28th. The Nanjing Daily, which did not join the Newspaper Union, was also not published. Therefore, the Central Daily News, the Peace Daily, and the small Social Daily were selling quickly. Newspapers from Shanghai also rushed to Nanjing and were bought out. The relevant parties were deeply anxious about this and eagerly hoped for a solution. At 1 p.m. on the 28th, Zhang You [blank space], the director of the Nanjing People's Daily and representative of the management, and Zhou Yidong, the director of the Guidance Section of the Central Propaganda Department, the mediator, went to the Jixian Inn in the small lane of Zhuangyuanjing in Fuzimiao and negotiated with the labor representatives until late at night. The labor side initially requested to adjust the treatment, increasing by 62% from December and issuing double salaries at the end of the year. The management stated that the salary increase would increase by 40% from January next year, and that the year-end double salary could not be paid because the newspapers were losing money. Later, the mediator proposed a compromise: the salary increase could start from December, and the increase multiple hoped that both parties would not insist and seek another compromise number. As for the year-end allowance, it was not necessary to issue it in the name of double salary, but each newspaper could issue some according to its ability. The labor side stated that they would consider it, but required an average of 200,000 yuan per person for the year-end allowance. The management representatives failed to agree immediately because the newspapers' ability to bear the burden was different. It was already the morning of the 29th, even if a solution could be found, it would be impossible to publish the newspaper on the 29th, so they dispersed without result. On the morning of the 29th, the labor side distributed leaflets on the main roads, explaining their demands and calling for social support. At 10 a.m., the responsible persons of the management newspapers gathered again at the Shanghai Hotel on Zhongshan East Road to discuss countermeasures and decided to solve them separately. At 4 p.m., a notice saying "This newspaper is expected to resume publication tomorrow" was posted on the closed door of the Dagang Newspaper. Other newspapers were also working hard to seek a compromise in the negotiations between labor and management. Until the evening, there was no consensus.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The responsible persons of the private newspapers in Nanjing that were suspended and the mediators from the relevant agencies continued to meet at the Shanghai Hotel at 7 p.m. on the 29th to discuss how to deal with the labor strike. First, the responsible persons of each newspaper reported the results of seeking individual solutions, and most of them had little success. The labor side had agreed to make concessions on the salary increase, increasing by 50%, but the year-end allowance issue was still the crux of the matter. The meeting lasted until 11:30 p.m. without result.</p>
<h3>Northern Fujian Prepares to Form a Company to Transport and Sell Local Products to Nanyang</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 29th] The counties in northern Fujian have recently initiated the preparation to form a local product transportation and sales company, specializing in transporting and selling northern Fujian's tea, timber, paper bamboo shoots and other local products to Nanyang. The capital is 2 billion yuan. In addition to raising private shares, they have also sent people to Xiamen to negotiate with the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Economic Construction Company to participate in the investment.</p>
<h3>An Aircraft of the Capital Air Transport Team Crashes; Nine People Injured in a Rice Field</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 29th] An aircraft accident occurred in the capital on the 29th. A C-47 type 302 aircraft of the Green Air Transport Brigade took off from the Da Jiaochang Airport at 7:37 a.m., bound for northern Jiangsu. Less than 20 minutes later, the aircraft engine overheated, and the pilot immediately turned back, intending to return to Da Jiaochang, but it was impossible. It was forced to land in a rice field outside Cangbo Gate. The aircraft caught fire and burned down immediately. All nine people on board were injured, two of them seriously. They were all personnel from the Air Transport Brigade Headquarters.</p>
<h3>The Yellow River Before the Ice Jam</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Fan Shiqin</p>
<p>It is really not easy to manage the Yellow River. It is like a person with chronic illness for many years, whose internal organs are relaxed and whose limbs are stiff. If you use light medicine, it will be ineffective, and if you use heavy medicine, it is a concern. Many "famous doctors" are helpless for it, and many "good medicines" are ineffective for it. Not to mention curing it at the root, even curing it at the surface is not a simple matter.</p>
<p>Like the current closing of the breach at Huayuankou, it only leads the downstream back to the old course, which cannot be said to cure the root cause. Whether Huayuankou can be blocked by the end of January next year is still a mystery. In addition, recently, the stone-opening machine at Lu Wangfen was blown to pieces by the Communist army. The stones at the construction site are just like the troops fighting need bullets, and suddenly there is a "ran out of bullets" panic. How can the construction team with bare hands do it? In the past two days, the upper reaches of Shanzhou have been frozen, and the ice is about to come down. I am afraid that no matter how big or dense the wooden stakes are, it is difficult to resist the sharp edge of the ice knife. These days, the project of adding wooden stakes at Huayuankou is indeed going smoothly, perhaps someone has invited the ghost of Mr. Kong Ming, suddenly, in this season of strong northwest winds, there are two or three days of southeast winds, which kill the water in the breach, and the wooden stakes are added one by one. We can now assume that the stone materials can still be solved, and the Communist Party's sabotage is nothing; of course, we also assume that the project can be completed successfully and on schedule, and the ice knife and ice mountain will not damage this project of more than 2.2 million yuan. Under such an assumption, we can naturally rest assured about the new Yellow River flooded area. That is, we don't have to worry about the Jia Luhe and Shahe rivers in the new Yellow River flooded area. In the past, the water depth was only seven or eight meters, and even the bottom of the river could be seen, but now it has reached fourteen or five meters; naturally, we don't have to worry about such water depth will submerge the dykes on both sides; the seven-kilometer-long area north of Zhoujiakou that is about to be dangerous does not need to be considered; as for the ice floods in January in the future, the ice will rush over and climb up the dyke, and suddenly kill the workers who are rushing to rescue the disaster, it is also a dream; there is no need to rescue the dykes in the new Yellow River flooded area, saving the trouble of digging ice and soil to build dykes, and saving the trouble of building huge wooden structures to protect the dykes. In short, everything can be ignored, and everything can be avoided, because the water has returned to its old home.</p>
<p>However, the Yellow River is like a drunkard, who can be helped to the east and fall to the west, or helped to the west and fall to the east. If the breach at Huayuankou is blocked, the water level in the upper reaches will suddenly rise by two meters. Then Wen County and Meng County will bear the brunt. The dyke in Wen County has not been properly repaired since the great flood in the 23rd year of the Republic of China. There are 27 kilometers of dykes there that need to be repaired immediately, otherwise the river water is already one foot higher than the ground, and once the dyke breaks, Wen County will be submerged immediately. The dyke in Meng County is relatively solid, but if it is not repaired, it will not be able to withstand the impact of high water levels. Some people worry that if something goes wrong in the Wen County and Meng County area, the water will flow to the Qin River, and from the Qin River to the Wei River, and it can even sweep to Tianjin. This disaster will not be small.</p>
<p>Living on the Yellow River and eating Yellow River carp makes people drool, but unfortunately, being buried in the belly of the carp is also unforgivable. It is quite difficult to conscript labor for other things, but if you want to repair the Yellow River dykes, the people will be happy to volunteer. They know the great harm of the Yellow River better than any Yellow River expert. This year, the cost of managing the lower reaches of the Yellow River, including the Huayuankou closing project, is 6 million yuan. This number seems very large, but after more than 2 million yuan has been spent on the closing of the breach, the remaining amount given to the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan is only more than 1 million yuan per province. In this way, the number is not very large. At the same time, because the price changes are too large, the budget is not up to the actual needs, so there are cases of cutting corners. For example, the dykes built in the Lankao area are only built with sand and soil. It is inevitable that there will be danger when the water passes by in the future. This problem is not very serious, because as long as you spend a lot of money again, it will be solved. The most regrettable thing is that in the Wen and Meng area, the Communist army is erratic. Recently, the Huayuankou Closing Bureau sent an engineering team to work, and it was abandoned three times in ten days. How can this make the work progress freely? Under the CCP's large-scale destruction policy, it can also be said that under the lack of political stability, it is always difficult to manage the Yellow River everywhere. Xia Yu's success in water management was closely related to the peace of the country. Before he managed the water, Shun had already released the four evil tribes, and there was peace within five thousand miles to the deserted areas. But now the Yellow River has become a man-made natural disaster, which requires engineering experts with political and scientific minds to overcome.</p>
<p>In short, there are many problems gathered on the Yellow River: if the breach is not closed, the ice flood in the new Yellow River flooded area this year will be a difficult hurdle; if it is closed, there is a risk of problems in the Wen and Meng area; and we must take care of all aspects, and the CCP is in the middle to make it difficult. I heard that the Yellow River iron bridge will be rebuilt next year, then the water level will be raised by one or two feet, which is also a point that those who care about the Yellow River should care about.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A New Page in Sino-Siamese Relations</h3>
<p>The first Siamese Ambassador to China, Shengku Anturalerek, met with Chairman Chiang yesterday, presented his credentials, and said: "The friendship between China and Siam has a long history, because there are various close relationships between the two countries. For example, many of your people live in my country, living and working in peace and contentment, and passing on from generation to generation, which is enough to show the harmony between the Chinese and Siamese people. This friendly relationship has been further consolidated by the recent signing of the Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship." After accepting the credentials presented by the Siamese Ambassador, our Chairman replied, saying: "During the Second World War, the poisonous forces of the Japanese aggressors caused the people of the book country to suffer immensely. The Chinese people deeply sympathize with this, because, as Your Excellency said just now, the friendship between China and Siam has a long history, and there are indeed various close relationships between the two countries. We are very pleased that so many of our people live in Siam, living and working in peace and contentment, and passing on from generation to generation. And we firmly believe that due to the signing of the Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship, the formal diplomatic relationship between your country and ours has been established, and the friendship between the Chinese and Siamese peoples must be strengthened accordingly." The arrival of the Siamese Ambassador to take office this time has indeed opened a new page in Sino-Siamese relations. As the Siamese Ambassador takes office, I would like to look forward to the Sino-Siamese opening.</p>
<p>China and Siam are brotherly countries, and have had frequent prostitutes since ancient times. There are a large number of Chinese compatriots living in Siam, accounting for almost one-third of the total population of Siam, so the relationship between China and Siam has always been very close and intimate. Since the Japanese invaders attempted to create the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere", Japan has sent fifth columnists to carry out activities in Siam on a large scale. Some Siamese people consciously or unconsciously fell for the poison of Japanese propaganda. The trend of the times has stirred up the rise of narrow nationalism, re-establishing its national name as "Thailand", imitating Hitler's style of "recovering lost land", and constantly instigating the Burmese people living in our southwestern border region, especially the "Yi" people in the southern border of Siam, to return to the fold. Since Thailand advocated the so-called "Greater Thai Nation" movement, there have been reefs everywhere in Sino-Siamese relations. Because of the advocacy of narrow nationalism, when the Pearl Harbor Incident broke out, the likes of Pan Phibun seized the central hub and went against the tide. We know very well that all this is contrary to the true direction of the people of Thailand. As our Chairman said in his reply, during the Second World War, the poisonous forces of the Japanese aggressors caused the people of Siam to suffer immensely, and the Chinese people deeply sympathize with them.</p>
<p>Siam began its rebirth after the Second World War. At this time, China and Siam began to establish normal diplomatic relations, which is really a gratifying thing. I remember that at the beginning of this year, our country sent a delegation to visit Siam, led by Minister Li Tiezheng, to visit Siam; later, the Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship was signed, establishing the foundation for normal diplomatic relations between China and Siam. Now the Siamese Ambassador to China has arrived, all of which are manifestations of Sino-Siamese friendly relations. Our country's attitude towards the various ethnic groups in Asia has been repeatedly announced to the world by our Chairman. We not only have no ambitions for aggression, but also want to regard ourselves as elder brothers, and work with the various ethnic groups in Asia to seek human welfare, especially the improvement of the welfare of the people of Asia. Since China and Siam have had very close relations in the past, and now that we are in the value of national rejuvenation and rebirth, and Sino-Siamese relations are opening a new page with the arrival of the first Siamese Ambassador to China, how to promote and carry forward the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Siamese peoples that existed in the past should be the goal of those who are concerned about enhancing Sino-Siamese relations. We hope that due to the arrival of the first Siamese Ambassador to China, the relations between China and Siam, whether cultural, economic, or commercial, can be more closely linked. This is not only related to the friendship between China and Siam, but also to the prosperity and peace of the East.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to wish the Siamese Ambassador to China success in his mission, and a healthy and happy journey!</p>
<h3>The Future Implementation of the Constitution</h3>
<p>After fifteen years of twists and turns, the National Assembly was finally convened. After forty days of meetings, it completed the Constitution of the Republic of China and decided that the government would formally announce its promulgation on January 1, 1947, and its implementation on December 25, 1947. This is the most important step forward in China's democratic politics and the greatest price paid for the countless martyrs and patriots who shed their blood and gave their lives since the Xinhai Revolution overthrew the imperial system.</p>
<p>Judging from the Constitution itself, it is certainly not perfect. For example, the wording of Article 1, "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People, governed by the people, owned by the people, and enjoyed by the people," is redundant and cumbersome. Since the general preamble states, "Based on the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Republic of China… this Constitution is enacted," it goes without saying that it is based on the Three Principles of the People. Since it is clearly stated as "Three Principles of the People," it is naturally a democratic republic. Since it is stated as a "democratic republic," why is it necessary to add "governed by the people, owned by the people, and enjoyed by the people"? However, during the discussion of this article in the Comprehensive Review Committee, representatives of various parties and factions argued fiercely. Later, a majority vote passed an amendment to change the article to "The Republic of China is a republic based on the Three Principles of the People." The Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party expressed strong dissatisfaction, almost causing the Constitutional Assembly to fall into a stalemate. Finally, the Kuomintang representatives, in order to consider the overall situation, reconsidered and cancelled the amendment, maintaining the original proposal, and the atmosphere at the meeting became harmonious again.</p>
<p>Also, issues such as the national capital, the duties of the president and the Executive Yuan, the powers of the Legislative Yuan and the National Assembly, and the issues of the Manchu, Hui, Tibetan, and other minority ethnic groups, all underwent lengthy debates. The final amended articles that were passed were all the result of mutual concessions and compromises. Originally, the number of Kuomintang representatives in this National Assembly increased because the Chinese Communist Party and some members of the Democratic League refused to join. However, they did not rely on their majority to act arbitrarily, but everywhere displayed a spirit of impartiality and a cooperative attitude, fully respecting and accommodating the opinions of minority parties and representatives of minority ethnic groups. The success of this National Assembly in enacting the Constitution is at least largely due to the ability of the Kuomintang representatives, under the guidance of Chairman Chiang, to make concessions and create a harmonious atmosphere.</p>
<p>This Constitution of the Republic of China inevitably has many shortcomings, but these shortcomings are precisely the manifestation of the spirit of cooperation among the various parties and factions in China. The key to a constitution lies in its implementation. Without a foundation of national cooperation, even a perfect constitution is just a piece of paper. From the perspective of basic democratic principles, this constitution is already full of the spirit of democracy. From the perspective of the realities of various aspects of China, this constitution is even more a manifestation of the unity of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Therefore, we cannot engage in textual criticism to search for the shortcomings of the Constitution. Our greatest responsibility in the future is to promote the unity and cooperation of all parties and factions in the country, so that the Constitution can be truly implemented, lay the foundation for China's democratic politics, launch the work of national construction, and relieve the people from their suffering. Since the Xinhai Revolution, internal troubles and external threats have come one after another. In particular, during the eight years of the War of Resistance, the suffering of the Chinese people has reached its final stage. They hate internal strife and are tired of war. If the leaders of the various parties and factions in China still have a conscience, they should abandon their arms as soon as possible, and, based on this Constitution, make a fresh start with the people. When their selfish desires disappear, it will be the day when the people of the whole country understand them.</p>
<p>The work of drafting the Constitution has been successfully completed, and the period of political tutelage has come to an end. The Kuomintang's sincere intention to return power to the people and put the country first has been demonstrated to the world. Now, what reason do the leaders of the various parties and factions in China have to continue to maintain their armed forces and divide the country, causing suffering to the people and pushing China's national economy to bankruptcy? Now, all enlightened people and newspapers across the country attribute all of China's misfortunes to war. This is naturally an undeniable truth. However, if some people refuse to participate in the National Assembly and refuse to cooperate in implementing the Constitution, who should ultimately bear the responsibility for the war? The eyes of the people are sharp, and right and wrong have long been clear. From now on, they can no longer support any activities that cause division and separation.</p>
<p>The completion of the Constitution should have been a cause for national celebration. However, today, a shadow hangs over the joy of the Chinese people. In the past, the United States experienced the North-South reconciliation, which led to peace and prosperity that lasts to this day. Recently, in Vietnam, the Independence League and the Kuomintang also put aside their suspicions and formed a coalition government in the face of a common enemy. These are all excellent examples worthy of our emulation. Now, the Central Government is still making concessions and attempting to achieve peace again. We sincerely hope that the various parties and factions that did not participate in the work of drafting the Constitution will promptly change their attitude, reduce the difficulties in implementing the Constitution, and fulfill the hopes of the people of the country.</p>

<h3>Suzhou Re-discusses Commercial Loan Measures, Relaxing Restrictions to Suit Actual Circumstances; Total Demand Estimated at Over 4 Billion Yuan Across All Sectors</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Suzhou, 29th dispatch] The county government had previously reached an agreement with state-owned commercial banks within the county to provide commercial loans totaling 5 billion yuan. However, the method was determined to be separate mortgage loans by each bank. This would result in industries that cannot provide collateral, such as hotels, restaurants, and businesses that sell goods that cannot be mortgaged, such as fruits and fresh produce, being unable to obtain loans. Furthermore, the costs of transportation and storage would increase the burden on borrowers. This is far removed from the actual situation and needs of businesses in the county. Moreover, providing mortgage loans separately is a regular business of banks and has nothing to do with the urgent need to assist businesses in the county. Therefore, the calls for loans have subsided in recent days, leaving many in a desperate situation. However, after the news that Provincial Chairman Wang telegraphed the Central Government and the four major banks to request the allocation of 50 billion yuan in emergency industrial and commercial loans for Jiangsu Province was revealed, the business community in the county was greatly encouraged. Furthermore, the Provincial Business Federation forwarded a telegram from the Provincial Bank on the 28th, approving relaxed loan measures. This is like a glimmer of dawn in the midst of heavy clouds for the commercial economy of the county.

<h3>Meng River Continues to be Dredged; Ship Lock to be Established at the River Mouth</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Wujin dispatch] The county is located in the center of the Jinghu Railway Line, bordering the Yangtze River to the north and Taihu Lake to the south. The land is fertile, making it an important area in the Jiangnan region. There are three major rivers connecting to the Yangtze River: the Meng River, the Zao River, and the Desheng River. The Meng River is the largest, with a wide and straight riverbed. Its northern end connects to the Yangtze River at Mengcheng, and its southern end connects to the Grand Canal at Benniu. It has always been a convenient route for transportation between the north and south of the Yangtze River, with merchants and travelers coming and going in an endless stream. However, the riverbed is often silted up due to the intrusion of Yangtze River water, which carries sand and mud. Although efforts have been made to dredge it frequently, the dredging is easily undone. This has a significant impact on farmland irrigation, industrial and commercial transportation. After the establishment of the County Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Association, Chairman Zhuang Zhongxi [莊中希] carefully planned this matter. He also joined forces with Zhenjiang and Danyang counties to request assistance from the Suning Branch in dredging the Zhenwu Canal, renovating the Danyang Zhuanhu embankment, and dredging the Meng River. It was also proposed to establish a ship lock at the mouth of the river connecting to the Yangtze River, which would be opened and closed at regular intervals to ensure a certain water level. Regarding the Meng River dredging project, the section from Benniu to Suishiwan was completed this spring. It is reported that the entire project from Suishiwan to the river mouth, as well as the establishment of a ship lock at the mouth of the Meng River, were approved at the Zhenjiang Labor Relief Conference a few days ago. The County Government will utilize the dry season in winter to resume the dredging project, and the location for the lock will be determined by personnel sent by the Jiangnan Water Conservancy Bureau. The lock project will be completed before the opening of the silkworm season. Once this project is completed, the river will no longer flow directly into the river, and the sand and mud that flow in can be accumulated in the lock. Subsequently, the scope of dredging will be reduced, and the construction will be easier. The water level of the entire county can be controlled artificially. Vessels of 100 tons can pass through the county seat and travel smoothly without hindrance. The cultivation of farmland can be protected from the disaster of flood and drought. This matter concerns the major welfare of all counties in the Jiangnan region. People in the area were overjoyed upon hearing this news and expressed their hope for its early success.</p>

<h3>Good News for Unemployed and Out-of-School Youth in Northern Jiangsu: Recruiting Youth into the Youth Army</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Wang Gonghan from Yangzhou</p>
<p>Recruitment Methods</p>
<p>This is good news for unemployed and out-of-school youth in northern Jiangsu. Chairman Chiang, recognizing that northern Jiangsu has suffered greatly from enemy occupation and Communist forces' ravages over the past decade, with severe disaster conditions and a considerable number of unemployed and out-of-school youth, has ordered the 202nd Division of the Youth Army to establish "Youth Recruitment Stations" in Xuzhou, Nantong, Yangzhou, and Bengbu to recruit a large number of unemployed and out-of-school youth. The recruitment method still resembles the "examination" style, but those with a higher elementary education level are eligible to apply. The age requirement is 18 to 30 years old. The "Yangzhou Recruitment Station" has been established for more than a week, and the person in charge is Major Tang Qihan, the battalion commander of the engineer battalion of the 202nd Division of the Youth Army. The station is located within the Jiangdu branch of the Youth League on Weihai Street. According to Tang, the higher authorities have stipulated that his unit is to recruit 100 youth, which is expected to be completed within a month.</p>
<p>Purpose of Recruitment According to the reporter's observation, the purpose of the recruitment can be considered purely to help and cultivate youth. If we focus on the unemployment and out-of-school situation of youth, then it is clearly providing a path to employment for unemployed and out-of-school youth. Moreover, this path is a "good way out" that is not easily obtained by ordinary youth. Tang Qihan said at a press conference yesterday (the 24th): After receiving a certain period of military and vocational training, the youth who pass the examination and are admitted can be demobilized according to the past treatment of veterans of the Youth Army – either to continue their education or to find employment, and will no longer be required to serve in the military.</p>
<p>Social Misunderstandings</p>
<p>However, their work has only just begun here. The society here has a misunderstanding about their work, misunderstanding that their work is a disguised form of conscription. I wonder if this situation also exists in the other three places—Xuzhou, Nantong, and Bengbu? The reporter thinks: Serving in the military is an obligation that every citizen must fulfill, but the fact that the general public has a sense of fear and avoidance towards military service cannot be denied. However, if the public misunderstands this recruitment of youth into the Youth Army, it is a loss for the unemployed and out-of-school youth themselves because, according to the reporter's understanding, this is an opportunity that unemployed and out-of-school youth may not have again to be helped and cultivated. The authorities have taken this measure purely out of love for the youth. If anyone thinks that this measure by the authorities is a disguised form of conscription, the reporter believes that it is still probably a preferential treatment specially devised by the authorities for unemployed and out-of-school educated youth. Because, we know: sooner or later, everyone has to serve in the military. Therefore, the reporter would like to introduce the history of the Youth Army to concerned readers.</p>
<p>History of the Youth Army</p>
<p>In October of the 33rd year of the Republic, the Central Plains War broke out. The fierce flames of the enemy's hooves penetrated deeply. When Hunan and Guangxi fell, Chairman Chiang, for the sake of final victory and the needs of future nation-building, raised his arms and called on 100,000 educated youth to join the army. At that time, energetic and enthusiastic youth from all corners of the country ran out, signed up for enlistment one after another, and crowded into the military camps like rivers flowing into the sea. In less than two months, the number of 100,000 had already been exceeded. The Youth Army was established in the spring of the following year (the 34th year of the Republic). There were nine divisions at that time, and their designations and locations were: the 201st Division in Bishan, Sichuan; the 202nd Division in Tongjiang, Sichuan; the 203rd Division in Luxian, Sichuan; the 204th Division in Wanxian, Sichuan; the 205th Division in Guiyang, Guizhou; the 206th Division in Hanzhong, Shaanxi; the 207th Division in Kunming, Yunnan; the 208th Division in Jiangxi; and the 209th Division in Fujian. Training began in February of that year.</p>
<p>Composition</p>
<p>Needless to say, the composition of these 100,000 Youth Army soldiers was quite complex. There were elementary school students; there were also university professors; there were elementary school teachers; there were also students of private schools. There were factory technicians; there were also government officials. There were people from the financial and transportation sectors, and there were also rural self-government workers. There were also children of high officials and wealthy merchants, and so on. However, after entering the camp, the Youth Army, under the "benevolent appeasement," "strict discipline," and "active education" of officers at all levels, established discipline and settled down. In less than half a year, it had become a fairly elite army.</p>
<p>Life in the Army</p>
<p>Regarding their lives, they ate three meals a day, and the food was all nutritious. For example, breakfast was soybeans and peanuts, lunch was fish and meat and vegetables, and dinner was the same as lunch. In terms of education, at the beginning of enlistment, there was recruit education, then non-commissioned officer education, and then officer education. In terms of spiritual education and political training, special attention was paid to cultivating the awareness of the nationalization of the army. In terms of management, efforts were made to promote self-government as much as possible, to improve their motivation for self-study, and to abolish corporal punishment. In terms of training subjects, there were drill grounds and lecture halls. In terms of entertainment, there were many types: drama, Peking opera, Sichuan opera, popular music, dance, horse opera, and variety shows. In addition, there was a party every week.</p>
<p>Demobilization Situation</p>
<p>In mid-August of the 34th year of the Republic, the Japanese pirates surrendered unconditionally. In order to take into account the studies of the majority of students in the army, the government decided that the Youth Army would complete the preparatory officer education from December of the 34th year of the Republic to the end of May of the 35th year of the Republic, and would begin demobilization in June.</p>
<p>At the end of May of the 35th year of the Republic, the government prepared all the transportation for the demobilization of the Youth Army. Thus, on June 1st, the demobilization of the Youth Army was carried out. Cars, trains, and ships transported the demobilized youth to every central area, and then legal travel expenses were issued according to the distance that each youth still had to travel. At the same time, the government guaranteed the studies and careers of the demobilized youth. For example: in the field of science, high school graduates could be exempted from examinations and sent by the Ministry of Education to national universities for advanced studies. Those who entered high school from junior high school and those who entered junior high school from higher elementary school received the same preferential treatment as those who entered university from high school. In addition, three university preparatory classes and eight youth middle schools were established. In terms of re-employment, in addition to guaranteeing that those who were already employed would return to their original jobs, six vocational training classes were also established, including telecommunications, transportation, agriculture and forestry, accounting, and teacher training.</p>
<p>Current Situation</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense, in order to facilitate management, a Reserve Cadre Training Office was specially set up in the Ministry of National Defense, responsible for this matter. Chiang Ching-kuo was in charge of the office. Branch offices and communication stations have now been established in various places. At the same time, the Youth Army was reorganized from nine divisions into six divisions, namely the 202nd Division, the 203rd Division, the 205th Division, the 206th Division, the 207th Division, and the 208th Division. They are currently stationed in Wuxian, Chongqing, Hengyang, Luoyang, Shenyang, and Beiping, preparing for the collective training of high school students next year.</p>

<h3>Leclerc Arrives in Saigon; Reinforcements Urgently Dispatched to Vietnam; Viet Minh Unyielding, Prepares for Long-Term Resistance</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 28th] General Leclerc, Inspector General of the French Army in North Africa, arrived here this afternoon. Vietnamese army, navy, and air force generals welcomed him at the airport. Leclerc's residence issued a communique stating that he had come to Vietnam on government orders for a short-term inspection. Leclerc commanded the French army in the Far East during the war and was known for his expertise in mobile warfare. [Reuters, Paris, 28th] According to an army official, the French army will launch an offensive in Vietnam in three to four weeks. The reinforcements have been urgently dispatched there. Two large troop carriers are already en route. The 43,500-ton "Île de France" is scheduled to leave Cherbourg today with 9,000 new soldiers for Toulon, and will then load a large number of troops for Vietnam. According to the Air Force, the French Air Force in Vietnam has a squadron of Spitfire fighters and a squadron of Junkers Ju 52 transport aircraft, based in Saigon, under the command of General Anteriou. The aircraft are brand new and have resumed bombing, strafing, and reconnaissance activities. Army personnel also stated that based on various reports, there are indeed Japanese individuals within the Viet Minh army.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 28th] France appears to be preparing to send a powerful fleet to the Vietnamese coast today, while also planning to use diplomatic means and aircraft and artillery to prevent the disintegration of the empire, the signs of which are becoming increasingly evident. Viet Minh escort teams are reportedly moving towards Hanoi, where French forces are working to clear the overseas Chinese district, which appears to be developing into a long-term and intense street battle. Conflicting reports are coming from Saigon. One report says that the Viet Minh has completed military preparations and is under orders to take action as soon as they are ready in Cochinchina. A French press agency report contradicts this, claiming that the Viet Minh has been ordered to refrain from taking any obvious action for the time being. Saigon appears to be under siege, and the situation is tense. Fighter pilots on the French aircraft carriers "Béarn" and "Colosse" have had all leave canceled, and similar emergency orders have been issued to personnel on the destroyers "Fantastique," "Terrible," and "Dixmude." As the new year approaches, it is generally believed that these are the harbingers of the imminent dispatch of these ships to the Far East.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting in the Suburbs of Hanoi; French-Controlled Areas Surrounded</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 28th] Reports state that French patrol aircraft have strafed Viet Minh escort teams with machine guns near Hanoi. Viet Minh forces are fiercely attacking French forces around Hanoi, with fierce fighting in the suburbs. The French-controlled part of Hanoi remains surrounded by locals and cut off from the outside world.

The Viet Minh has launched two fierce attacks on the Hanoi Botanical Garden, but were repelled. The dyke has been completely occupied by French forces, and the Viet Minh has ceased its attacks in Lang Son. At the same time, Viet Minh broadcasts monitored in Bangkok stated that French forces near Nam Dinh, 40 miles southeast of Hanoi, have been cut off. French forces attempted to approach the vicinity of the Viet Minh President Ho Chi Minh's headquarters, but were repelled by Viet Minh forces using hand grenades. The radio station also stated that there was fierce fighting for five days north of Hanoi and near Hue, with 100 French soldiers killed. The French side stated that it is not true that Japanese individuals were found among the Viet Minh corpses.</p>

<p>[Special Correspondent in New York, 29th] Regarding the issue of the merger of the US Army and Navy, there have been fierce debates between the proponents and opponents in the Senate, and it has now reached the stage of preparing for a vote in Congress. Some senators have begun drafting a bill to unify the command of the US Army and Navy, but another group of senators intends to make a final effort to prevent the merger bill from being submitted to Congress. Both sides believe that Senator Gurney, the newly appointed chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is the key to resolving this case. Proponents intend to urge Gurney to support the new bill, while opponents intend to ask Gurney to postpone the submission of the merger bill for a vote. It is also learned that Secretary of the Navy Forrestal may be transferred to become the ambassador to the United Kingdom. If so, Washington will lose a powerful opponent of the unified command of the Army and Navy.</p>

<h3>Another New Soviet Initiative, Advocating that a General Disarmament Plan Be Drafted Within Three Months; This Move Is Aimed at Seizing the Initiative</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 28th] The Soviet Union has put forward a new proposal advocating that a complete disarmament plan be drafted within three months, including detailed plans for international control of atomic bombs and other terrible weapons. The Soviet representative to the Security Council, Gromyko, has sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Lie, submitting the proposal to the Security Council for discussion at its meeting next Tuesday. The proposal stipulates that the Security Council should immediately establish a special committee to implement the practical measures in the disarmament plan recently adopted by the General Assembly, and to submit recommendations on the plan within one to two months, or at the latest within three months. Related parties believe that this new Soviet initiative is intended to take the initiative and promote early disarmament. Molotov, the Soviet Foreign Minister, first proposed the disarmament plan at the United Nations General Assembly. After a long discussion, the General Assembly finally adopted a historic disarmament resolution on December 14, tasking the Security Council with drafting an international disarmament convention and establishing a special body to control atomic energy, rockets, and all other weapons of mass destruction. Gromyko's new resolution strongly argues that, in addition to implementing the General Assembly's plan, the Security Council should also establish international controls to ensure the reduction of armaments and armed forces. The United States' international atomic energy control plan is scheduled to be discussed by the Security Council on Monday. Some informal observers believe that this new Soviet resolution is intended to divert the Security Council's attention from the US atomic energy proposal. It is also expected that when the Atomic Energy Commission meets on Monday to discuss the report submitted to the Security Council next week, Gromyko may announce the Soviet Union's acceptance of the report, but at the same time will attach certain reservations in order to quickly enter the stage of universal disarmament negotiations.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 28th] Senator Vandenberg, a Republican, recently expressed his full agreement with the American Chief Representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, Baruch, who argued that the plan to control atomic energy should not involve the veto power. Vandenberg issued a written statement to the press today, stating that if the atomic energy control treaty inevitably involves the use of the veto power, the United States Senate will not approve it.</p>
<h3>De Gaulle Statement: Will Not Participate in Election</h3>
<p>[United Press Paris, 28th] The French presidential election is scheduled for January 16th. General De Gaulle today issued a lengthy 200-word statement to the press, announcing his unwillingness to be a candidate for the presidency of the Fourth Republic of France. He stated that he did not wish to be the chairman of an incompetent government with an incapable person, and therefore his political career would at least temporarily come to an end. De Gaulle was the leader of Free France during the war and is one of the most respected, feared, and hated figures since Napoleon. The Popular Republican Movement had promised De Gaulle its support if he were to be a presidential candidate. However, many French people, especially the communists, have accused De Gaulle of seeking strong executive power in the constitution, harboring dictatorial ambitions. Another group of French people fear that he still has influence in the senior ranks of the French military. There are also those who regard De Gaulle as the greatest figure in France since Joan of Arc. With De Gaulle's withdrawal from the competition, the only remaining presidential candidate is the Socialist leader, Auriol.</p>
<h3>New Posture in British-Soviet Relations: Marshal Montgomery Scheduled to Visit Soviet Union Early Next Month; Rumors Suggest Discussions on a 20-Year British-Soviet Peace Plan</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 28th] The "Daily Worker" diplomatic correspondent claims: British Chief of Staff Marshal Montgomery will visit Moscow early next month to discuss a twenty-year peace plan. Stalin will suggest to Marshal Montgomery that periodic British-Soviet military staff conferences be held, and a joint British-Soviet intelligence chief committee be established in Moscow. This is the outline of the twenty-year treaty of friendship agreed upon by Britain and the Soviet Union during the war. The correspondent further stated that Stalin hopes that this British-Soviet staff committee will be similar in nature to the British-American staff committee in Washington.</p>
<p>[United Press Moscow, 28th] Although British Chief of Staff Marshal Montgomery's visit to Moscow is of a goodwill nature, it will allow Marshal Montgomery to reunite with the Soviet generals with whom he worked during the war, and it will enhance the military ties between the peoples of Britain and the Soviet Union. Marshal Montgomery is expected to arrive in the New Year and will be hosted by Soviet Chief of Staff Marshal Vasilevsky. According to British military attaché in Moscow, Major General Garthorse, Marshal Montgomery's stay will be brief, but he will visit several major Soviet military institutions. Marshal Vasilevsky will host a banquet at the Red Army House on Marshal Montgomery's second night in the Soviet Union, followed by a performance at the Bolshoi Theatre. The British and American ambassadors to the Soviet Union will also welcome Marshal Montgomery. This is Marshal Montgomery's first visit to the Soviet Union, and it is also the culmination of his post-war world tour, as Marshal Montgomery has already visited the United States, Canada, and the Middle East. Since U.S. Chief of Staff Eisenhower's short visit to the Soviet Union in August 1945, Marshal Montgomery's visit is the biggest event. Marshal Montgomery will be accompanied by two staff members.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London, 28th] The newspapers here have mostly welcomed Marshal Montgomery's planned visit to Moscow, believing that it could ease tensions between Britain and the Soviet Union. Well-informed sources also said that Marshal Montgomery's trip may involve discussions with Soviet leaders on universal disarmament, military occupation of Germany, and accelerating the withdrawal of Allied forces from enemy territory. However, British War Office officials have refused to comment on this.</p>

<p>[Reuters Paris, 29th] The French Socialist Party's "L'Aurore" reported today: A spokesman for Moscow Radio recently said that he had good reason to believe that Britain and the United States had already signed a secret pact. This statement is fundamentally true, but it is a little premature.

(2) The military countries of Britain and the United States will combine all their financial, economic, and military resources. (3) In the event of a state of conflict, military activities will be directed by the Supreme Command, and the resources of the two countries will be controlled by the Economic Command to make the most favorable use for both parties. (4) Britain and the United States agree never to provoke any foreign country. This agreement shall only be effective when one of the two signatory countries is attacked by a third country. (5) This agreement does not contain any imperialistic nature. Its main purpose is to protect the interests of both countries throughout the world. (6) The staff departments of the two countries will hold periodic meetings. (7) This secret agreement is not aimed at any country. It is only for self-defense, so any country that can prove that it has no imperialistic goals can participate in this agreement. (8) The full text of this agreement will be released to the press only after it is signed.</p>

<h3>Situation in East Indies Remains Unstable: Armistice Agreement Shaken; Rumors Suggest Dutch Plan to Overthrow Indonesian Government</h3>
<p>[United Press Batavia, 28th] East Indies Republican Army Commander Soetomo issued a broadcast address after meeting with President Sukarno today, accusing the Dutch military of endangering the sovereignty and independence of the East Indies, making the people of Indonesia unbearable. He said that the time to express power has arrived. The recent armistice agreed with the Dutch military in order to discuss the recognition of the republic does not mean stopping the fight for independence. He asked the people of Indonesia to restore their fighting spirit to resist the Dutch military and transport military equipment and food to the front lines. According to a Dutch military spokesperson, since the armistice on October 15th, the Dutch military has only taken defensive actions. The recent conflict was caused by Indonesian troops crossing the border. On the 26th of this month, there were no fewer than ten shooting incidents in Bandung and Surabaya alone.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Batavia, 28th] The Indonesian News Agency recently published a message stating that the Commander-in-Chief of the Dutch military in the Dutch East Indies, General Spoor, intends to overthrow the Republic of Indonesia by force.

<h3>Churchill Attempts to Make a Comeback</h3>
<p>According to Agence France-Presse, New York, 27th, former British Prime Minister Churchill published an article in "Collier's" magazine today entitled "The Road to the Future," reiterating the necessity of "organizing the United States of Europe." The main points of the article have been seen in yesterday's newspapers and need not be repeated. However, one point is worth mentioning: although Churchill is no longer the ruling figure in Britain and has retreated to the position of opposition leader, his words and deeds are still attracting worldwide attention due to his prestige as a wartime leader, and he still appears to be a major force in the world of political thought.</p>
<p>It is still remembered that when Britain held a general election more than a year ago, the Labor Party, with an overwhelming advantage, defeated Churchill and the Conservative Party he led, British politicians thought that Churchill's political life would come to an end.</p>
<p>However, that is not the case. Churchill is still the leader of the Conservative Party and still has considerable power in British politics. When he travels between the continents of Europe and the Americas, delivering speeches everywhere, the public greets him with warm welcomes. He does not show any signs of dejection because of setbacks in the political arena.</p>
<p>Three Major Topics</p>
<p>Since resigning as Prime Minister, Churchill has continued to pay close attention to international politics. From his many speeches, it can be seen that he attaches great importance to three major topics: (1) The goals pursued by the Soviet Union and communism are dangerous; (2) The United States of Europe must be organized to revive the Old World; (3) The continued close cooperation between Britain and the United States is important.</p>
<p>In March of this year, Churchill's "Iron Curtain" speech in Fulton caused a great uproar internationally. The Soviet criticism was very sharp, and Stalin even said he was a "warmonger," believing that his purpose was to promote the idea of English-speaking nations dominating the world. Churchill's speech put Britain and the United States in an awkward position, and they had to try their best to state that Churchill's speech was only his personal opinion and not the position of the authorities. But Churchill insisted on his own views, saying, "In a few years, I think you will agree that what I said should be said."</p>
<p>As for the proposal to "organize the United States of Europe," the reaction it aroused was not as strong as the former. This year, he traveled to France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, and used his eloquent tongue to deliver speeches to the public, but the result did not cause a warm response. But although the response was small, Churchill himself insisted on his views without the slightest change.</p>
<p>Domestic Problems</p>
<p>Churchill also spared no effort in attacking British domestic problems. In his position as leader of the Conservative Party, he tried his best to criticize the policies of the Labor government, believing that the nationalization plan being implemented by the current government would lead to serious consequences. At the same time, he expressed deep alarm at the Labor Party's attitude towards handling the major problems facing the British Empire, believing that the imperial structure would undergo serious shake-ups.</p>
<p>Generally, people believe that Churchill's speeches on domestic problems are relatively mediocre and not as brilliant and moving as the speeches he gave when he was the wartime Prime Minister. Some younger people in the Conservative Party may think that Churchill is too conservative and that his re-seizing of power by the party is likely to lead to obstacles. But when the Conservative Party convened a conference in Blackpool in early October, Churchill's leadership position within the party did not waver but became more consolidated.</p>
<p>Since Churchill's defeat in the election, there have been many criticisms of him from all sides. Most of these criticisms come from the Kremlin and the left-wing elements of the Conservative Party. Some say that he adopted short-sighted strategies in the Asian theater to seek gains without labor; others say that he opposed the allied strategy that achieved great success in the European theater. A committee of parliament said that the reduction in the production of British tanks and artillery during the war once caused a critical situation, and Churchill should be held accountable. As for Elliot Roosevelt, he directly called Churchill a reactionary stubborn element in one of his recent books.</p>
<p>Popular Sentiment</p>
<p>In Britain, the public has a good sentiment towards him, but they opposed his policies and the party he led when voting. For example, the people of Margate voted for the Labor Party in the general election, but later suggested building a statue of Churchill on the cliffs of Dover, with a huge cigar in his mouth. Ships passing by the area at night can look up and see the faint red light on the cigar head. The cigar butts that Churchill smoked have been regarded as treasures by collectors. This summer, when Churchill went to Norway, the cigar butts he dropped sold very well in the markets of The Hague and Amsterdam, with prices as high as ninety-five guilders, equivalent to thirty-five U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>Ups and Downs in Politics</p>
<p>The ups and downs in politics, as well as the praise or criticism from all sides, are extremely ordinary things for Churchill. He has experienced too much in his seventy-two years of life. He first participated in the election in 1899 and suffered a disastrous defeat. During World War I, he held an important position as First Lord of the Admiralty, but he had to submit his resignation in 1915 due to the disastrous defeat in the Dardanelles campaign. After the war, he wanted to rejoin the House of Commons, but failed twice, but finally succeeded. After the outbreak of World War II, he once again took office as First Lord of the Admiralty, and in 1940, he was ordered by the British monarch to assume the position of Prime Minister, finally saving Britain from the brink of failure. These are all well known and have become part of history.</p>
<p>The end of World War II and the arrival of victory, Churchill participated in the election with the prestige of a wartime leader, and the result was defeated by the Labor Party, which was really unexpected by the world, but Churchill's spirit was not weakened by the failure. What will happen in the future, we may as well wait and see.</p>

<h3>Spanish Government in Exile: Mission Accomplished, Will Dissolve; Authority Transferred to Non-Governmental Party Committees</h3>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 28th] It is reported that the Spanish Republican government in exile led by Giral will reconsider dissolving the government at the beginning of the new year, and will transfer its powers to a non-governmental committee representing various Spanish political parties.

<h3>U.S. Policy Toward Korea Aims to Make Korea</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington, 28th] Two State Department officials gave a radio address today entitled "Our Country's Foreign Policy." The two were Martin, Director of the Japan and Korea Economic Division of the Department, and Bouton, Director of the Japan Division. The purpose of the speech was to clarify the policy adopted by the United States toward Korea, which is to make Korea independent and completely unified. Bouton said: "We have not yet been able to achieve any progress with the Soviet Union in following the path laid down by the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference a year ago. For this reason, we are now acting alone in accordance with the plan for the U.S. occupation zone." Both believe that the reconstruction of Korea faces many difficulties, because Korea's main industries are in the Soviet occupation zone. This year's autumn harvest was also poor. Martin said: "China may become a major customer of Korea, but the quantity of Korean exports may not be too large." Bouton said: "The United States should assist Korea for its own sake and for the sake of Korea, because a democratic, prosperous, and friendly Korea will be an important stabilizing factor in the Far East, and a peaceful Far East is the most important goal of U.S. foreign policy. The United States has assisted Korea in education programs, political development, and self-sufficiency in the south. Once the barrier dividing the north and south occupation zones of Korea is eliminated, the work carried out by the U.S. occupation zone in accordance with the current plan will not prevent the rapid unification of Korean social, economic, and political life. The United States and the Soviet Union held a meeting a year ago to formulate various ways to establish Korea's independence, but the plan completely failed, and the fault is not entirely on our side, nor is it entirely on the Soviet side. We are prepared to resume the meeting with the Soviet Union at any time to formulate an acceptable way to return Korea to the Koreans in accordance with the Moscow Agreement."</p>
<p>Someone asked why China and Britain, which jointly signed the Cairo Declaration, are not undertaking the occupation task in Korea? On this point, Bouton strongly stated that the various measures regarding the independence and unification of Korea are being drafted by the United States and the Soviet Union, and will be submitted to other countries for approval when the time is right.</p>
<p>Soviet Newspaper Commentary</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Moscow, 29th] Soviet journalist Smolensky wrote an article in the "Stalinsk Gazette," criticizing the U.S. occupation policy toward Korea. He roughly stated: The 1945 Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference decided to establish a temporary democratic government in Korea. The Koreans heard about it. However, the U.S. authorities did not take any action in this direction. The Americans merely took the place of the Japanese and replaced them, and did not change the fate of the Korean agricultural disaster. Agricultural reorganization is a major problem for Korea. 60% of the arable land still belongs to a small number of large landlords and newly established U.S.-Korean joint ventures. Japanese laws are still in effect, and the fate of the masses is getting worse day by day. A series of serious strikes between September and October 1945 showed dissatisfaction with the Americans. In some cases, these strikes turned into armed rebellions. The Korean people are eager to establish a true democratic government to serve their interests. This kind of government can only be established when the Moscow Conference decisions are correctly and fully implemented.</p>

<h3>New Contribution to Meteorological Measurement: Balloons Ascend into Clouds; Radio Transmission Using Electric Sound; Shanghai Meteorological Station of the Second Department of the Ministry of National Defense Adapts to Aviation Needs and Provides Meteorological Reports</h3>
<p>The Second Meteorological Station of the Ministry of National Defense has decided to supply meteorological reports to various parts of the country from now on in order to meet the needs of civil aviation. The reporter made a special visit to the station yesterday (on Dashilu). According to the station director Cheng Jun, the units under the jurisdiction of the station include more than 40 meteorological branch stations in major towns and cities across the country, which regularly collect and rebroadcast the climate of each branch station four times a day. At present, the station maintains meteorological links with the Soviet Union, Guam, Japan, Manila, the Spratly Islands, the Nanyang Islands, Singapore, Annam, Burma, India, and other places.</p>
<p>Weather forecasting work is divided into three parts: (1) ordinary meteorological observation (i.e., ground meteorological observation), (2) high-altitude airflow observation. This prediction of high-altitude clouds has recently achieved special and remarkable results. The station is now using a "thunder sound" ultra-shortwave radio transmitter, attached to a fire-shaped light balloon, to ascend into the cloud layer 20 kilometers above the ground. After that, the "thunder sound" ultra-shortwave radio transmission is used, which is exceptionally accurate. The application of this "thunder sound" marks a new stage in meteorological forecasting in our country, which will greatly benefit the development of civil aviation. It has now been decided to regularly provide weather forecast reports for reference when aircraft take off.</p>

<h3>Adjustment of Civil Servant Salaries: Expected Implementation in this City After One Week; Mayor's Monthly Salary to Increase to 918,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The central government has formally announced the adjustment of civil servant salaries. Yesterday, our reporter visited the Personnel Department of the City Government to inquire whether the salary adjustment for civil servants in this city would be implemented immediately. According to Zheng Tianmu, Director of the Personnel Department, the City Government has not yet received official documents from the central government. News from newspapers cannot yet serve as a basis for implementation. He estimated that official documents from the central government would arrive here in about a week. This city will implement the adjustment immediately upon receipt of the order. Director Zheng also exchanged views with Gu Chunfan, Director of the Finance Bureau, who believes that there will be no problem with salary disbursement.</p>
<p>According to the central government's newly revised adjustment method, the cost-of-living multiplier has been raised from 720 to 1100, and the basic subsidy has been increased from 110,000 to 170,000. As a result, civil servant salaries will increase by slightly less than 60% on average after the adjustment. However, this is a general average; strictly speaking, the higher the base salary, the smaller the percentage increase, and the lower the base salary, the larger the percentage increase.</p>
<p>According to our reporter's inquiries, the average salary amounts receivable by civil servants at all levels in various bureaus and departments under the City Government after the adjustment are as follows:</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's base salary is 680 yuan, and his original salary was approximately 600,000 yuan. After the adjustment, he will receive 918,000 yuan per month.</p>
<p>The base salaries of bureau chiefs and department heads vary slightly depending on their seniority, averaging approximately 500 yuan. Their original salaries were 470,000 yuan. After the adjustment, they will receive 720,000 yuan per month.</p>
<p>The base salaries of section chiefs also vary, averaging approximately 200 yuan. Their original salaries were 254,000 yuan. After the adjustment, they will receive 390,000 yuan per month.</p>
<p>Among staff members, the lowest base salary is 75 yuan, and their original salary was only 164,000 yuan. After the adjustment, they will receive 252,500 yuan per month.</p>
<p>Regarding police officers' salaries, according to the central government's regulations, the basic subsidy of 170,000 must be calculated at 60%, which is 100,200 yuan. Before the adjustment, the average salary of police officers was approximately 100,000 yuan. After the adjustment, it will be approximately 140,000 to 150,000 yuan.</p>
<p>As for the half-month's salary that Mayor Wu promised to advance before the adjustment order was announced, it will be deducted in installments after the salary adjustment. The specific installment plan will be determined by the City Government authorities.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Taicang Motor Company: All Routes Resume Service</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Taicang Long-Distance Motor Company will resume service on all routes that operated before the war, including Shanghai to Luodian, Liuhe, and Zhai Ding, as well as Wu Song to Binshan, Yangxing, Yuepu, and Luodian Qian, starting from January 1, 1947. The headquarters and Shanghai station will simultaneously relocate to their original address at No. 235 Wuzhen Road, Guangfu Road, Zhabei, to sell passenger tickets. Currently, because the Wuzhen Road Bridge was demolished during the war, passengers must travel east from the northern end of the Xinzha Bridge or west from the northern end of the New Garbage Bridge to reach the destination directly.</p>
<h3>New Year's Celebration Assembly: Name Changed</h3>
<p>The New Year's Celebration Assembly of All Circles in this City will be renamed "Shanghai Municipal Celebration Assembly of the Promulgation of the Constitution of the Republic of China and the 36th Anniversary of the Founding of the Republic" in accordance with the formal instructions of the central government. A meeting of the leaders and deputy leaders will be held at the City Industry Department at 10:00 AM this morning to discuss speeding up preparations. The leading party and government officials of this city will personally attend and provide guidance.</p>
<h3>Total Year-End Bonuses in All Industries: Expected to Exceed 50 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Well-placed business figures indicate that this year's year-end bonuses will be less contentious because the local authorities were able to establish standards in advance. Although some manufacturers may pay bonuses far exceeding those stipulated by the City Government due to high profits, this is voluntary and limited to a small number of employees. It is generally estimated that the total amount of year-end bonuses issued by all industries in this city will exceed 50 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Manufacturers' Association: The National Goods Market Reopened Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Manufacturers' Association of the National Goods Exhibition Market was established to promote mutual exchange and common development. The inaugural meeting was held in the auditorium of the market yesterday morning. Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the National General Chamber of Commerce, Mao Qingxiang, Chairman of the General Assembly of the China Production Promotion Association, and over 200 manufacturers attended the meeting. Hu Boxiang chaired the meeting, approved the articles of association, and elected committee members. A group photo was taken, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The National Goods Exhibition Market was closed after a dispute arose on the afternoon of the 27th when a police officer from the new precinct requested goods from the Shanghai Wool Company in the market. At a meeting of all the manufacturers in the market yesterday morning, Hu Boxiang was elected as chairman. They also welcomed Mao Qingxiang, Chairman of the China Production Promotion Association, and Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the National General Chamber of Commerce. After Chairman Hu, Mao Qingxiang, Wang Xiaolai, and Zhang Zilian, Mao Shengdong, Jiang Zhonghe, Ni Hanru, and Sheng Gongshu, the responsible persons of the market, repeatedly explained and persuaded the manufacturers, they decided to reopen the market immediately and elected representatives to handle negotiations.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Wang Jingzhi and Ye Zhen, the deputy managers of the Shanghai Wool Company, purchased more than 3,700 pounds of wool from Hongda and eleven other wool shops ten days ago, valued at more than 150 million yuan. All transactions were settled with bank drafts, but they were all returned due to insufficient funds. The company has declared liquidation. The victims jointly reported the matter to the new precinct. Police officers went to the National Goods Market to identify the defrauded goods, resulting in the dispute. Yesterday afternoon, the defrauded merchants hosted reporters at the Atlantic Western Restaurant to report the incident.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation: Memorial Service for Deceased Personnel</h3>
<p>Yesterday, China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) held a memorial service for deceased employees at the Central Funeral Home. In the center of the hall were the coffins of Captain Chen Ruirong, Co-pilot Nong Linxu, Trainee Pilot Qian Dingwu, and Telegraph Operator Lin Dahua. In front of the coffins was an altar surrounded by dozens of wreaths arranged in a semi-circle. The orchestra of the Poor Children's Education Center played mourning music. The memorial service began at 4:00 PM. General Manager Chen presided over the ceremony, with Director Chen and Deputy Director Deng assisting. After offering incense and paying respects, General Manager Chen delivered a eulogy, expressing deep condolences for the deceased employees and offering comfort to the colleagues who worked hard due to the accident. After the meeting, reporters asked General Manager Chen about the District Attorney's office's plan to prosecute the case according to the law. He stated that the company had reported everything to the competent authorities within 24 hours of the plane crash and had not dared to conceal anything. If the District Attorney's office believes that the company has failed to report something or must be held accountable or prosecuted for this reason, the company will appear in court according to the law and will not shirk responsibility. Currently, they have only seen reports in the newspapers, and the District Attorney's office has not yet sent official documents.</p>

<h3>Reviewing and Improving Facilities Based on the Three Plane Crashes: Weather is Closely Related to Flight; Blind Landing Equipment is Indispensable</h3>
<p>[Special Report by Our Newspaper] There are many examples of plane crashes in aviation history, but the tragedy of three passenger planes crashing and being destroyed in one day—or rather, within a few hours—in the same airspace, resulting in more than 80 deaths and injuries, is unprecedented. In addition, the day of the crashes was Christmas Day, the day of the Savior's birth. It is no wonder that the news caused shock in society and uproar in public opinion. From the central government to foreign countries, everyone is paying close attention to this matter and unanimously believes that the future of civil aviation should undergo a thorough review and improvement.</p>
<p>Based on available data, our reporter made a brief statistic of all aircraft accidents since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, as shown in the table below:</p>
<p>Date of Accident	Aircraft Name	Location of Accident	Number of Casualties</p>
<p>March 17	Dai Li's Special Plane	Near Nanjing</p>
<p>March 19	China Airlines Flight 139, Chongqing-Shanghai Route	Jinzhen, Hankou	30</p>
<p>April 8	CCP's Ye Ting, Wang Ruofei, etc.'s Special Plane	Near Xi'an	12</p>
<p>July 12	CNAC Flight 15, Shanghai-Ping Route	Near Jinan	55</p>
<p>September 20	China Airlines Flight 81, Kangding-Chongqing Route	Near Xichang	20</p>
<p>December 14	CNAC Flight 31, Ping-Shanghai Route	Changxing, Zhejiang	6</p>
<p>December 14	China Airlines Flight 67, Beijing-Shanghai Route	Longhua Airport	0</p>
<p>December 25	China Airlines Flight 140, Chongqing-Shanghai Route	Longhua Airport	30</p>
<p>December 25	China Airlines Flight 115, Chongqing-Shanghai Route	Suburbs of This City	40</p>
<p>December 25	CNAC Flight 48, Chongqing-Shanghai Route	Near Jiangwan	11</p>
<p>The causes of the accidents listed above are actually not that simple, and it is not easy to determine them absolutely, because the conclusions drawn solely based on the results of post-accident investigation and reconnaissance will always be somewhat different from the actual facts. However, just as historians often use the three factors of timing, location, and human factors to measure the success or failure of all worldly affairs, our research into the causes of aircraft accidents also falls within the scope of (1) changes in weather, (2) inadequate airport equipment, (3) errors by aviation personnel, and (4) aircraft malfunctions. Our reporter interviewed several experts on these issues, and the conclusion was that all of these difficulties can be overcome.</p>
<p>If the Secrets of Heaven Can Be Predicted, Victory Can Be Assured. First of all, from the perspective of climate, the so-called "unexpected changes in the weather" often cause aircraft accidents in an era when science has not yet fully developed to the point of "man conquering nature." Obstacles caused by these natural phenomena, such as dense fog, high-altitude icing, heavy rain, and storms, seem difficult to overcome. But at least, why can't we try to make efforts in the passive prediction and avoidance? After the last CNAC plane crashed in Changxing, Director Chen of the Central Meteorological Observatory in this city happened to talk to our reporter and said that if the losses from plane crashes were used to strengthen meteorological forecasting work, the possibility of accidents could be reduced to a very low level. His words are quite reasonable, and the aviation and meteorological communities urgently need to establish close ties. As far as current domestic flights are concerned, most only use radio to inquire about the weather conditions at the destination station when taking off. It can be said that they are completely ignorant of the possible changes that may occur several hours later, as well as the weather conditions over other places along the way. How can this kind of nearly blind flight not be dangerous? If meteorological work can be done well, in addition to establishing meteorological stations at both the departure and arrival locations, meteorological observation stations should be set up every certain distance along each route. These large and small meteorological stations and meteorological observation stations should report local weather conditions every certain period of time and coordinate with other parts of the country to predict possible changes in weather conditions at any time. Then, those that can fly will fly, and those that cannot fly will be grounded. If the secrets of heaven are revealed in advance, victory can be assured. Coupled with the improvement of other factors, the news of aircraft accidents may disappear from our ears.</p>
<p>Small Airports in Various Places Need to Be Opened. Secondly, when it comes to airport equipment, it can be divided into two aspects: one is the location, size, and quality of the airport itself. Taking Longhua Airport in Shanghai as an example, the Huangpu River is close by, and there is a lot of fog in winter, especially near the water, which is very suitable for aircraft landing, but the runway is too narrow, and the road surface is uneven. Water accumulates in puddles on rainy days. All of these are not up to the standards of a modern airport. Moreover, there is only one civil airport in Shanghai, which is an unreasonable phenomenon due to the heavy burden. At the same time, several small airports are needed in the middle of each route so that there can be a place to help in case of sudden changes or obstacles in the middle of the route. The second is the mechanical equipment for airport landing and communication, especially the blind landing equipment using radar, which is indispensable. These have been proposed many times and are considered to be an urgent matter.</p>
<p>The Lives of Flight Personnel Must Absolutely Not Be Deviant. As for the obstacles of the aircraft itself, in addition to some old planes that are too old and should never be used for business reasons, it is closely related to the skills of the flight personnel. Good driving skills certainly cannot be achieved overnight, but pre-inspection preparations must be absolutely precise and careful. Our reporter especially believes that all staff responsible for public safety cannot have deviant private lives during each flight. Our reporter encountered an overturned car in Qianxi, and the reason was that the driver had spent the night with a prostitute the night before, so he was distracted the next day. The task of an aircraft pilot is more difficult than that of a car driver. Can we imagine the danger that a pilot who is drunk or eager to rush to the destination for revelry might cause?</p>
<p>The Aviation Management of the United States is Sufficient for Reference. The management of civil aviation is also very important. Taking the United States, which is advanced in aviation, as an example, the government has two institutions under the Ministry of Commerce that specifically manage civil aviation. One is the Civil Aeronautics Board, which is almost a decision-making body and is not subject to the constraints of the Ministry of Commerce. Its tasks are to formulate safety standards and aviation rules, issue and revoke various licenses, collect aviation taxes, stipulate passenger and freight and airmail rates, and handle competition and cooperation between private airlines. In addition, it is responsible for formulating regulations on accidents, investigating and publishing information on accidents, and preventing them from happening again to reduce the number of accidents. Another implementing agency is the Civil Aeronautics Administration, and the director is under the command of the Secretary of Commerce and is responsible for developing domestic airlines, airports, and other facilities, including design, construction, command, protection, etc. In addition, it is responsible for the research and improvement of various aviation technologies and can take emergency measures to revoke safety licenses in accordance with the regulations set by the Civil Aeronautics Board. It has the power to impose fines on those who violate aviation regulations. The organization and tasks of the above-mentioned two management agencies can be a good reference for the Civil Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Transportation, which will soon be established in China.</p>
<p>The unfortunate incident has passed. The dead are dead, and the injured are injured. What we can hope for is that while handling the aftermath, the authorities will earnestly engage in reform so that this painful lesson can promote a new era in China's civil aviation industry. Then, the dead will also be able to rest in peace.</p>
<h3>Several Severely Injured in the Plane Crash: No Danger to Life</h3>
<p>The Coffins of Yi Xingzheng and Fu Huang Were Taken Away Yesterday; Yu Yimin Was Claimed by Relatives</p>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Among the bodies of the victims of the plane crash, the body of Yu Yimin was still unclaimed in the Wanguo Funeral Home a few days ago. Until yesterday, a relative went to claim it. There are currently six victims who have not yet been placed in coffins in the funeral home. As for Tan Xingzheng and Fu Huang, who were placed in coffins in the China Funeral Home a few days ago, their closest relatives arrived yesterday and had them placed in coffins. Of the eleven injured people still being treated at Zhongshan Hospital, it is said that the injuries of several of the severely injured have improved and there is no danger to life.</p>
<h3>Zheng Pingru's Grievance Has Not Been Redressed; Her Mother's Life is Difficult; She Submits a Petition Requesting Rain and Dew; Severely Punish Ding Mocun; Grant Compensation</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] During the eight years of occupation in this city, the heroic and tragic history created by our underground workers is too numerous to write. In 1939, Miss Zheng Pingru, a graduate of the College of Political Science and Law, sacrificed her appearance to assassinate the puppet secret agent demon king Ding Mocun, but unfortunately, she failed and was killed instead. The grievance has not been redressed for seven years. Now that Ding Mocun is being tried by the High Court in the capital, Zheng's mother entrusted lawyers Han Xuezhang and Gu Weixiong to submit a petition to the High Court a month ago, requesting that Ding be severely punished to comfort the spirits of the underground workers. Recently, she also submitted a document to the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, requesting that compensation be granted. The text of her submission is as follows: "Submission regarding the request to severely punish Ding Mocun, avenge my daughter, and grant compensation. My daughter, Zheng Pingru, has been engaged in underground work in Shanghai since 1937 under the command of multiple bureaus. On December 16, 1939, she designed to lure Ding Mocun to the Siberian Fur Store on Jing'an Temple Road to buy a fur coat, in order to assassinate Ding. Unfortunately, the assassination failed, and she was arrested and detained in a house on Yidingpan Road (confirmed by Pan Sansheng). She was murdered on the afternoon of December 26. It has been seven years since then, and the grievance has not been redressed. Ding is currently being tried, and according to the Central News Agency's news on the 5th of this month, the Bureau has investigated and confirmed the fact that my daughter was murdered. I implore your Bureau to uphold justice and transfer the matter to the court to severely punish Ding and avenge my daughter. My husband, Zheng Yingbo, was the Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai High Court and passed away in 1943. I am alone and without support, and my life is difficult. I respectfully request that compensation be granted to me so that I can live out my days. This would be a great kindness. Submitted to the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang. Submitted by Zheng Huajun."</p>
<h3>Property Confiscation of Han Jians During Probation: Temporary Suspension of Enforcement</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Regarding the property of Han Jians who have already been sentenced, according to law, after deducting the necessary living expenses for their families, the remainder shall be confiscated. However, there are also cases of Han Jians who have been given suspended sentences. There is some doubt as to whether the property confiscation should be enforced in the same way, or whether the detained and sealed property should be returned due to the suspended sentence. The judicial organs of this city submitted a request to the Ministry of Justice for transfer to the Legal Interpretation Committee of the Judicial Yuan for unified interpretation of the law. It is now known that the committee has convened a meeting on the matter. It was decided that the property confiscation in cases of suspended sentences will be temporarily suspended during the probation period.</p>
<h3>Qian Huafo, Shi Zhichao, and Others Will Hold a Charity Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting</h3>
<p>Calligraphers and painters Qian Huafo and Shi Zhichao, in response to the invitation of the Shanghai Charity Burial Association, have jointly organized an exhibition and charity sale of works by nine friends, including Zhou Lianxia, Zhao Junmin, Xiong Songquan, Shen Duchi, Zong Ligu, Xie Zhiguang, and Li Xiyun, to subsidize the association's expenses. It is said that it is scheduled to be held from January 4th to 6th at the YMCA in Baxianqiao. Visitors will also receive a copy of "Key Tips for Learning Calligraphy" compiled by Shi Zhichao.</p>
<h3>Retrial of the "Wolf of Changshu": All Witnesses Will Be Summoned for Confrontation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Military Court will hold a joint collegial hearing for the Japanese war criminal "Wolf of Changshu," Michimura Haruki, at 1:00 PM today. All relevant witnesses in the case will be summoned for confrontation to facilitate the conclusion of the trial and set a date for sentencing.</p>
<h3>Li Fangjing, One of the Passengers on CNAC Flight 140, Carried a Large Sum of Money; Unsuccessful Search After the Plane Crash; Fellow Townsman Shen Yumin Came to Shanghai to Collect the Body; Expressed Extreme Grief and Anger at the Loss of Luggage</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Shen Yumin, Director of the Compilation Department of the Committee for the Compilation of Historical Materials of the Kuomintang Party History, told our newspaper that Li Fangjing, from Guangdong, who was on the ill-fated CNAC Flight 140, graduated from the Department of Education of Southwest Associated University and taught at Tsinghua High School, Nankai High School, and the Sichuan Institute of Education. This year, he passed the examination for self-funded study abroad and had already reached an agreement with the Graduate School of Cornell University in the United States to study there. However, Li came from a poor family and had difficulty with funding. His relatives and classmates helped him raise funds. Director Shen was from the same hometown as Li and helped Li borrow money from Representative Feng, a overseas Chinese representative who was attending the National Assembly in the capital. Representative Feng generously agreed because Li was only short 2 million yuan and expressed his willingness to meet with Li before leaving Beijing. Therefore, Li packed his bags and happily flew to Beijing, but unexpectedly suffered this tragedy and died! After hearing the bad news, Director Shen rushed to Shanghai to collect Li's body. However, when he arrived at Longhua Airport yesterday, most of the staff members were not there, and there was very little luggage left. After many inquiries, he learned that even in the midst of this shocking event, the China National Aviation Corporation still took its usual day off on Sunday, so there was no one to contact about claiming the belongings. Shen believes that the plane crashed within the airport, and the passengers' luggage should not have been lost. Li had a large sum of money with him entrusted by friends, but now it cannot be found. He is particularly grief-stricken and angry. He also said that the relatives of all the deceased passengers should jointly pursue responsibility and that the District Court should strictly prosecute to comfort the dead and ensure future safety.</p>
<h3>Ivory Opium Pipes Inlaid with White Jade; Two Opium Dens with Luxurious Equipment; 18 People Arrested After One Week of Investigation</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] A week ago, the Old Gate Police Station received a report that someone had privately set up an opium den at No. 4 Cide Lane, Zhejiang North Road, to provide opium for people to smoke. Branch Director Quan Jiang sent staff members led by Section Chief Jiang to investigate. After a week, it was learned that the number of entrances and exits to the building was four, making it difficult to raid. The police then sent undercover officers disguised as fruit vendors to the lane to determine the route. At 10:30 PM on the 28th, Section Chief Zhang Guodong led Police Chief Chen Jun'gan, Wang Congzhou, officers Li Junkun, Cui Ziliang, Weng Yao, Bai Haishan, Yang Zhongming, Du Guozhen, and others disguised to the location. Several officers were ordered to climb over the roof from neighboring houses and guard the windows. The remaining officers entered simultaneously from each door. At that time, there were fifteen customers smoking opium in the attic on the third floor and the roof. When they saw the police officers arrive, some tried to escape through the windows, but it was too late, and all were captured.</p>
<p>The opium den owner and opium customers were identified as Jin Zairong (33 years old, from Taicang), Yang Chen A'xiao (47 years old, from Baoshan, both residents of No. 4 Cide Lane), Jia Ruxi (46 years old, from Yangzhou, resident of No. 250 Fujian Road), Han Jingpo (34 years old, from Yangzhou, resident of the same address), Fu Tongkang (43 years old, from Suzhou, resident of Yuelai Nanhua Store on Guangdong Road), Wu Fengchi (37 years old, from Hebei, resident of No. 13 Chengji Lane on Guangdong Road), Zhuang Yonggao (50 years old, from Nanjing, resident of No. 4 Cide Lane, Zhejiang North Road), Xue Jianqiu (45 years old, from Anhui, resident of No. 155 Gubba Road), Lu Linbai (38 years old, from Shanghai, resident of No. 156 Renshou Lane, Huimin Road), Wang Shouhong (30 years old, resident of No. 2 Yongde Lane, Ximen Road), Yang Chenshi (53 years old, from Zhishan), Han Chenshi (32 years old, from Yangzhou), Xu Yuanchang (37 years old, from Ningbo), Sun Guangtao (31 years old, from Changzhou), and Huang Deming (44 years old, the above five all residents of No. 4 Cide Lane). Three ivory opium pipes inlaid with white jade and two opium lamps were seized on the spot, as well as two copper pots in which opium paste was being cooked. A Mauser chrome-plated pistol, number 75010, without a license, was found in the partition wall. All the people and evidence were taken back to the branch station. After a thorough investigation, the main criminal, Jin Zairong, confessed that all the opium was purchased from Han Yuming on the third floor of No. 7 Baoyu Lane, Zhejiang South Road. Starting from February this year, each transaction involved ten or twenty taels of opium. An examination of his checkbook revealed transactions totaling 12,178,000 yuan, but the total amount cannot be determined at this time. Jin was then escorted to the aforementioned location. Section Chief Zhang first deployed officers around the building and then sent two officers to climb over the roof from a neighboring building. Zhang knocked on the back door, but there was no response for a long time. At that time, Han knew that he had been discovered and was destroying evidence inside. About half an hour later, he opened the door, and the police officers rushed in. The house had ten or more rooms, all with suites, and three people were smoking opium inside. Han was arrested, and a piece of opium was found in his leather shoes. His wife, Han Shi Xiuru (32 years old, from Tianjin), admitted to selling drugs but denied that there was any other opium in the house. Finally, a secret side door was found next to the bed on the third floor. Pushing open the door, it was a four-story attic filled with household appliances. After a long search, another large piece of opium weighing more than ten taels was found, as well as opium pipes and lamps. Han, along with his nephew Han Jiling (18 years old, from Tianjin) and three opium customers, were taken to the station. The District Prosecutor's Office applied for their detention for ten days for further investigation.</p>

<h3>District Chief Li Boqing Says His Detention is Untrue</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, it was reported that Gao Paolian, the wife of Li Boqing, the district chief of the 16th district of this city, was accused of printing seals in the name of the "Youth Training Corps" and sealing up the Qinghua Elementary School in Nanhua New Village. Yesterday, this reporter met with Mr. Li in person at the residence of a certain important person. When asked about this news, he said that there was no such thing as Nanhua New Village in the 16th district, nor did his wife cover the district seal to seal up the elementary school. As for the saying of being taken into custody again, it is especially untrue. Since the reporter met him in person, it is sufficient to prove that there was no such thing as being taken into custody again. It must be a mistake in the transmission.</p>
<h3>French Trading Firm Loses U.S. Dollars in Theft; Difficulty in Investigation Due to No Fingerprints Left</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The French-owned Xindeng Foreign Firm at No. 147, No. 47, Huqiu Road, this city, was visited by a thief yesterday morning, losing 2,200 U.S. dollars. At that time, the office door and drawers were pried open, but the thief did not leave any fingerprints. The earliest person to discover the case was Xu Dong, the legal person and manager of the firm (26 years old). It was already 10:00 am yesterday, so when the Huangpu Police Sub-bureau received the report and sent officers to investigate, it was very difficult to find clues, and no progress has been made so far.</p>
<h3>Snakes as Objects of Worship, No Need for Fishing Nets; Bizarre Customs of the Gaoshan People; Cutting Off Heads and Placing Them on Soil Platforms for Show; Drinking Blood Wine from Linked Cups Considered Intimate Friends</h3>
<p>[Special Report by Our Newspaper] The Taiwan Gaoshan Ethnic Group Customs Exhibition is being held on the second floor of the Daxin Company. The reporter once made a hurried visit.</p>
<p>From these many exhibited photos and exhibits, we can see the general outline of the life of the Gaoshan ethnic group. It is really a life close to the original, somewhat similar to the life of the natives in American movies. In religion, the Gaoshan ethnic group belongs to a monotheistic religion and is also an animistic religion. Snakes are their "totem" and objects of worship. Among the exhibits, there is a pair of 500-year-old snakes. In addition, there are many pictographic carvings, all based on snakes. The chief of the indigenous people has his own authority, but his authority is still under the authority of the gods. When the chief and his tribesmen gather, they often only wear a short skirt, but he has a "shell chain" full of jewels to show his identity. He sometimes wears a small shell garment to show solemnity and grandeur during major ceremonies such as weddings and battles. The small shells are only the size of a tender pearl rice. After they are strung together, they look like a thick, loose white velvet thread. They also nail foreign buttons with patterns on their clothes, which is really a wonderful use of buttons.</p>
<p>Their houses are all simple thatched huts supported by short pieces of wood. They also have looms and granaries. After the agricultural work is completed every year, a grand ceremony is held. In addition to crops, their main foods include fish and wild animals. They do not use fishing nets to catch fish, but use wooden and iron forks. This type of fish fork is only three lengths long and relies entirely on skilled and accurate techniques. They also use various long spears and bows and arrows to hunt animals. In fact, the weapons they use in war are nothing more than these, but they are made more sophisticated. Sharp spears, curved swords, and barbed spears fully demonstrate the Gaoshan ethnic group's spirit of killing and martial arts. After the fight, the cut-off head is placed on the head platform, which is considered a glorious show of force.</p>
<p>Here is a strange thing called Lianbei (linked cups). Two pairs of long cups are connected together, and it has three uses: (1) When beheading, use Lianbei to hold blood and wine for drinking, which is regarded as an intimate friend of the beheaded person. (2) When the chief mediates disputes for people, both parties drink together with Lianbei to release their suspicions. (3) Used by couples to drink marriage wine.</p>
<p>In art, they are not without achievements. There are deer head spoons carved from hardwood and various intricately carved offering plates. Their pottery, pipes, and medicine mortars also have their own styles. There is also a statue of an ancient hero, naked, looking quite handsome.</p>
<p>Although they have not reached the realm of perfection in art, a kind of brilliant talent can be expressed from the rough and simple.</p>
<h3>Luo Zhuoying Talks About the Political Situation in Guangdong Province: Food is No Longer in Short Supply, Transportation is Gradually Restored, and the Silk Industry Has a Promising Future</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Luo Zhuoying, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning. In the afternoon, he attended a tea party hosted by the Guangdong fellow villagers in Shanghai, during which he talked about the recent situation in Guangdong. He reported on the security, food, transportation, and economic situation in Guangdong since the restoration.</p>
<p>Luo said: After the victory, there were more than 100,000 enemy, puppet, bandit, and mixed troops in Guangdong. The authorities have been continuously suppressing, incorporating, resettling, and disbanding them. It was not until April of this year that the situation gradually stabilized. At present, there is absolutely no problem with security in Guangdong. Only near Hong Kong and Kowloon are there still small groups of bandits.</p>
<p>As for food, Guangdong has always been insufficient. At the end of April this year, the price of rice once broke through the 100,000 yuan mark. Fortunately, thanks to the transportation of rice by the overseas Chinese in Luo'an Nanhua, the relief from the central government, and the assistance from the Guangdong fellow villagers in Nanjing and Shanghai, the price of rice gradually fell back, and the people's hearts tended to stabilize. At the same time, the Guangdong Provincial Government implemented a comprehensive production, comprehensive conservation, comprehensive purchase and transportation, and comprehensive control policy, which has been quite effective. This year, there is no problem with rice in Guangdong. At present, we are actively trying to solve the problem of food shortages in March, April, May, and June next year.</p>
<p>In terms of transportation, waterways to all rivers have been opened, but there are insufficient ships. The pre-war railways, Yuehan and Guangjiu, have all resumed operation. The highway is now handed over to private operation by the provincial government and given guarantees and incentives. Overseas Chinese have invested in construction.</p>
<p>Regarding the economy, the silk industry in Guangdong is very promising. According to experts' inspections, it is said to be more promising than Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The provincial government has set a five-year economic plan, but it lacks capital. It is hoped that all sectors will actively invest and not miss the good opportunity to build Guangdong. The development of production in Guangdong can open up the Nanyang market, which is closely related to the economic future of our country.</p>
<h3>Youth Army 202nd Division Came to Shanghai to Find Training Sites</h3>
<p>The 146th Brigade of the Shanghai Garrison was ordered to gradually move its defense. It was rumored that the defense of the Shanghai suburbs would be taken over by the 202nd Division of the Youth Army. Yesterday, Wu Hanchao, the chief of the Staff Office of the Garrison Command, told reporters that the 202nd Division was looking for a camp in Shanghai for training. As for which unit would take over the defense of the Shanghai area, the order from the Ministry of National Defense has not yet arrived.

<h3>Welcoming the New Year</h3>
<p>"The moon is cold, the sky is clear, and the night is deep,</p>
<p>A beauty's smile is worth a thousand gold pieces,</p>
<p>Hanging silk sleeves dance, raising mournful sounds,</p>
<p>Do not sing Bai Xue in Yingzhong,</p>
<p>The Wu Song at midnight moves your heart,</p>
<p>Moves your heart, hoping you appreciate,</p>
<p>I wish to be a pair of mandarin ducks in Tianchi,</p>
<p>Flying away to the blue clouds one day."</p>
<p>Li Bai's White Silk Song</p>
<p>Music and women are indispensable decorations in a metropolis, and dancing is a synthesis of music and women, occupying a large force in Shanghai's entertainment circle. Dancing was originally the earliest product of human civilization. In any nation during the theocratic era, dancing was an important program for worshiping gods and ancestors. However, in the current stage of Shanghai, dancing has changed its nature. Under the dim and ambiguous lights, embracing women dressed like demons, coupled with the magnificent jazz music, has become a sale of money and lust. It is vastly different from the artistic dancing of the past.</p>
<p>Christmas has just passed, and the New Year is coming, which is the festive season for dancing. The night in the city is not lonely originally, but it is especially lively these days. Although neon lights have been banned, there are still many tempting lights everywhere, beckoning to pedestrians on the roadside at any time. A burst of music blows over in the cold wind. If you can't control your emotions, stepping into the door of the dance hall will allow you to see a moving scene. Pairs of dancers spin in the dance floor, and various instruments play together to form a "song of the night", stirring people's heartstrings. Here, it is full of the laughter of pleasure-seekers.</p>
<h3>A Review of Shanghai Dance Halls</h3>
<p>The trend of dancing has become popular in today's Shanghai. From high-ranking officials and wealthy businessmen to salaried people, especially students, they all linger in the dance halls. They dance and dance, day and night, simply forgetting everything. However, dancing in Shanghai has only a short history.</p>
<p>The earliest dancing in Shanghai was originally a game for foreigners. At that time, the Astor House Hotel at the end of the Waibaidu Bridge and the Carlton Hotel near the Racecourse held social tea dances every Saturday and Sunday evening. Chinese people were very rare. In the twelfth year of the Republic of China, the Yipinxing Hotel also imitated the social tea dance. At that time, many high-ranking officials and dignitaries stayed at the Yipinxing Hotel, and the tea dance was also lively. This can be said to be the earliest Chinese dance hall in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Commercial Dance Halls Were First Created by Black Cat</p>
<p>The first commercial dance hall was the Black Cat Dance Hall next to the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on Xizang Road. There were dance hostesses to accompany the dance, three dances for one yuan, which was also the price set at that time. After the opening of the Black Cat Dance Hall, the tea dance at Yipinxing was virtually cancelled. Then, the Peach Blossom Palace on Aiduya Road, the Moon Palace on North Sichuan Road, and the Lidao on Ningbo Road were opened. However, at that time, there were very few people in Shanghai who could dance. It was not uncommon to see people making mistakes in their steps, somersaulting, and being embarrassed, which was often ridiculed by Westerners. Moreover, the society was not as permissive as it is now. It was unsightly for men and women to embrace, and there were many criticisms. The dance hall business was not very developed.</p>
<p>As dancing became popular over time, people gradually became accustomed to it, and there were more and more visitors. Therefore, new dance halls sprung up like mushrooms, such as Dadong, Dahu, Lafei, and Dahua, which were established one after another. The business was generally good. At that time, there was also a kind of small dance hall, which was set up by speculators to attract middle-class dancers, such as Shunfeng, Nightclub, Xiaoyao, Shengli, and Huilingdeng, which followed one after another. The dance tickets were changed to five to eight dances per yuan, and the tea fee was reduced to two or four corners. At this point, ordinary salaried people, and even small clerks in shops, became guests in the dance hall. Dancing in Shanghai slowly became popular. At that time, although the dance hall business was booming, they paid great attention to customers and did not lose their intention to accommodate. There would never be a situation where a large group of dance hostesses would come to introduce themselves to sit at the table, entangling endlessly, making people laugh and cry. Later, affected by the world economic panic, the Shanghai market was shrouded in "depression". The business was particularly accommodating. Many dance halls with three dances for one yuan did not hesitate to lower their prices and changed to five dances for one yuan. Almost all dance halls held afternoon tea dances, offering refreshments to attract customers. However, if you brought a dance partner in, you still had to spend money on tea, because the dance hall and the dance hostesses only hoped to earn more income from the dance tickets. At first, red dancers scorned participating in tea dances, but gradually, under the drive of the whip of life, many of them also switched to tea dances. This was a stage where the dance industry was going downhill.</p>
<p>The cannon fire of "August 13th" broke the extravagant life of Shanghai people who were obsessed with pleasure and extravagance. However, after the National Army withdrew to the west, the appearance of Shanghai gradually became prosperous again. At that time, a group of wealthy businessmen came to Shanghai from the mainland to take refuge. These people, who had huge amounts of money and nothing to do, indulged in pleasure, causing Shanghai's entertainment industry to develop abnormally. Dance halls, of course, were no exception. The old dance halls reopened one after another, and several new dance halls also opened. However, due to the martial law in the concession, the evening dance started at 8:00 pm. Every Saturday night, it was open all night, and some even stayed open all night. Tea dances were still very common. Many medium-sized and small dance halls also had so-called lunch dances. If you were interested, you could dance from 12:00 noon to 4:00 am the next morning.</p>
<p>The Dance Market in the Isolated Island Was Like Crazy</p>
<p>At that time, the residents on the isolated island were like crazy about dancing. Whether it was day or night, the dance halls were always full, and they were even more crowded on Saturdays. In the dance floor, you could only see shoulders rubbing against each other and crowds moving. The "foreign fiddlers" were also working extra hard. As soon as one song ended, another song started, tiring the enthusiastic dancers. The whole hall was shrouded in the atmosphere of rouge, powder, smoke, and alcohol, until the banknotes in the dancers' pockets were all sent into the dance hostesses' purses, and everyone returned with pleasure. At this time, on the long front line, countless officers and soldiers were fighting bloody battles, but Shanghai could no longer hear the sound of cannons. The tragic past was also blurred and forgotten. Who still remembered the national crisis and family difficulties!</p>
<p>After Victory</p>
<p>After the victory, Shanghai's dance halls were like weeds after a spring breeze, showing a prosperous life. American sailors had stashed away American dollar bills in their pockets that they had been unable to spend for months. Of course, they had to have fun after going ashore. The dance hall owners received a batch of foreign gods of wealth and were really smiling from ear to ear. However, the sailors fighting and making trouble after getting drunk were also a headache for the dance halls. Moreover, the good times did not last long. The sailors' pockets slowly emptied, and the business of the dance halls also declined accordingly. Therefore, they changed their business policies one after another and continued to do business with the Chinese.</p>
<h3>Social Dancing Relieves Loneliness and Eliminates Worries</h3>
<p>The custom of dancing has spread to China and has almost become an important item in sensuality. Most young masters use social interaction as an excuse to achieve their purpose of playing with women. Many of the dance hostesses who accompany the dance are also transformed from girls in brothels. The dance hall has become a place to satisfy carnal desires. However, in European and American countries, the background and position of dancing are completely different from those in China. The men and women are either friends or colleagues. They like this way and go dancing together. They simply regard dancing as an indoor sport and a kind of beautified sentiment, so they dance easily and naturally. Relieving loneliness and eliminating worries really have a special flavor. At grand banquets, dancing in unison and in rhythm is even more indispensable, which is really worthy of the word "social".</p>
<p>The initial social dance was certainly very rigid. Later, the relationship between men and women in society gradually became free, the dance skills became more relaxed, and the steps became more complex, from "slow" to "fast". The purpose of this transformation is nothing more than to attract each other with the opposite sex and to adjust the dryness of social interaction with the melody of beautiful music. This is called high-level sentiment!</p>
<h3>Old Stories of Fifty Years Ago The Shanghai Daotai Office Dance Party Was the First Time in Chinese Officialdom</h3>
<p>In the twenty-third year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the late Qing Dynasty (1896 in the Western calendar), on the tenth day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar, it was the birthday of Empress Dowager Cixi. Cai Jun, the Shanghai Daotai, held a grand banquet to entertain foreign guests and held a dance party. This was the first time that the Chinese officialdom used a dance party to entertain foreign guests, and it was also the first time that Shanghai had a public dance.</p>
<p>The venue for the dance party was set up in the Foreign Affairs Bureau's office on Jing'an Temple Road. From the gate on the road to the outside of the Foreign Affairs Bureau's gate, thousands of bright, angular, and glazed lamps were hung, with colorful lights shining brilliantly. Five-color silks were hung on the corners of the lamps, dancing in the wind. At the same time, hundreds of electric lamps were installed, illuminating the place as if it were daytime. Inside, there were cloakrooms and cane racks. On the large restaurant, there were I-shaped dining tables, full of flowers and fragrant wines and delicacies. The dance hall was set up in the inner courtyard, with teak floors that were smooth and mirrored. There were also rest rooms, smoking rooms, and dressing rooms, with bright windows and clean tables, and new furnishings. The corridors were covered with national flags of various countries, as well as silk curtains. This arrangement took a lot of effort at the time.</p>
<p>In advance, Daotai Cai sent out 600 invitations, inviting consuls from various countries, naval admirals from the United States, Britain, France, and Germany, and gentlemen and merchants from various countries residing in Shanghai to attend the meeting. Daotai Cai led the interpreter Feng Taishou and the members of the Foreign Affairs Bureau, the commissioners, and the members of the Mixed Court to greet the guests. The patrol room also sent many interpreters to help take care of things. A Western music band, led by "Peina", was brought from Hong Kong, with a total of 40 people, and also participated in the grand event.</p>
<p>On this day, the newly arrived guests were either in armor, or in formal dresses with medals, and the women were in fox furs, bright and dazzling. The hosts were also dressed neatly and greeted them in person. The dishes prepared were extremely rich, and the cups, plates, knives, and forks were the best of the time. After the banquet, the guests rested briefly, and after the female guests washed up, the dance began. It was not until the east was white that the guests returned with pleasure. Afterwards, the foreigners praised Daotai Cai, saying that Daotai Cai treated Westerners not only with courtesy, but also knew Western customs well and did not bind Westerners with Chinese etiquette. Especially this dance party was indeed an exception. It was intended to connect with foreign countries in the midst of celebrating the festival and to show respect to Westerners. It was truly rare. This unprecedented dance party in Shanghai really set a precedent. Although it was a bit unappealing to the general public at the time.</p>
<h3>Male Dancers</h3>
<p>The term "male dancer" may be unfamiliar to everyone. Originally, under the principle of equality between men and women, there should be male dancers as well as female dancers. In dance halls in European and American countries, male dancers are not rare. They, like female dancers, accompany people to dance, but this custom has not yet become popular in China.</p>
<p>In the 26th year of the Republic of China, male dancers appeared in the Paramount. It is said that he was a well-known expert who had been teaching dancing all along. Introduced by a certain dance hostess, he entered the Paramount Dance Hall and taught dancing there every night. At the same time, he could accompany ladies and wives to dance at any time. However, it was a flash in the pan and disappeared in a few days. Since then, no one has succeeded him.</p>
<h3>The Girls on the Volcano: From Greenhorns to Red Stars</h3>
<p>Dancers are the most important element of a dance hall. Shops need sufficient goods, restaurants need good food, and dance halls of course need beautiful dancers. If the dance hall truly has red stars as numerous as clouds, then a magnificent lineup and thriving business can be expected soon.</p>
<p>The lives of dancers are full of tragedy. We only see them in heavy makeup and flamboyant clothes, radiating smiles, but we don't know that behind their smiles are actually tears of bitterness. They are mostly from backward petty bourgeois or middle-class families. Because of poverty, because of life, they are forced to walk onto the volcano, selling their youth. Although Shanghai is hailed as a world metropolis, career opportunities for women are still pitifully few. Moreover, most of them have not had the opportunity to receive education, and there is no suitable work for them to do. Even if there is work, there are not enough factories to accommodate them, and the meager wages cannot support them. In their families, most have widowed mothers, and weak younger brothers and sisters. Even if their fathers are still alive, they are plagued by poverty and disease. The entire burden of family life rests on their shoulders. In order to survive, and because of the demand in the city, they have no choice but to come out and dance.</p>
<p>To prepare to become a dancer, one must first learn to dance. There are several dance training schools in Shanghai that often give special treatment to these prospective dancers and do not charge tuition. As long as they patiently learn there for ten days or half a month, and understand a few dance steps, they can officially enter the profession.</p>
<p>Training complete. After completing their training, they are introduced to dance halls by their female friends or the dance training school. At first, they can only enter small dance halls. Before that, they have to borrow money from all sides to raise funds to purchase fashionable clothes, and go through a hasty procedure of getting a perm and beauty treatment to cope. Then they enter the hall and begin their dancing career.</p>
<p>The facilities in small dance halls are crude, and the patrons are vulgar and unrefined. After spending a year or half a year in small dance halls, they gradually become familiar with the ropes, and they get to know more female friends. At the same time, they also have some familiar patrons. At this time, they visit the first and second-class dance halls. Seeing the grand atmosphere naturally moves their hearts, and they try to move up to a higher-class dance hall.</p>
<p>Advancement. Advancement is not easy. In addition to having a decent appearance and figure, they must also have more refined dancing skills, and better conversational and social skills. Their clothes and decorations should also be more elaborate. Most importantly, they need wealthy patrons who can afford to support them. Otherwise, after being promoted, they will not be able to maintain their business, and they will lose face instead. It is a case of the higher they climb, the harder they fall. In this way, they rise step by step from third-class to second-class to first-class. A dancer with good looks, skilled dancing, and social skills can hope to step into a first-class dance hall in three to five years.</p>
<p>The income of dancers is mainly based on dance tickets. The dance tickets have to be split with the dance hall. The most popular dancers can get 70%, and the dance hall gets 30%. The next level gets a 40/60 split. The "Aunt Gui" dancers only get a 50/50 split. After the dancer splits the ticket price with the dance hall, they still have to go through another layer of exploitation by the dance hostess, who takes away another 20-30%, so the actual income is very limited.</p>
<p>Table. Sitting at tables brings in more income, but ordinary dancers do not get a turn every night. Only those red-hot dance stars can rotate between eight or ten tables a night. The most popular dancers now earn nearly ten million yuan per month. This huge number is staggering, but the most miserable "Osmanthus" dancers earn less than one hundred thousand yuan per month.</p>
<p>Patrons enter the dance hall to have fun, so the dancers cannot put on a stern face. However, vulgar patrons often make all kinds of unsightly jokes in addition to dancing. The dancers respond with smiling faces, but can only cry secretly when no one is watching. In the Shanghai, where human desires run rampant, patrons make further demands on the dancers. The young and inexperienced greenhorns, under the temptation of money, often give up the purity inherited from their parents and let themselves be slaughtered.</p>
<p>Red Star. It is very difficult to climb to the throne of a red star. One must have special talents in all aspects such as "art," "social skills," and "style," and at the same time be able to attract a large number of guests to patronize her. However, it is difficult to maintain such a luxurious lifestyle solely on normal dance ticket income. Even if one rotates between tables ten times a night, one can only earn 50,000 yuan (assuming an average dance ticket price of 10,000 yuan, which must be split with the venue and the dance hostess). Therefore, their biggest income still comes from the extra rewards of wealthy patrons. This, of course, comes with strings attached. The mysterious relationship is self-evident.</p>
<p>In the dance halls filled with debauchery, dancers are easily influenced by the environment. Many popular and successful dancers, after getting through the difficult times, often drift along with the current, only seeking immediate revelry and not thinking about their drifting fate. As for those who fall and become hopeless, it is sigh-worthy.</p>
<p>Banning Dancing</p>
<p>Currently, the number of dancers registered with the Municipal Government Police Bureau has exceeded two thousand. They are all young women, ranging in age from thirteen or fourteen to about thirty years old. Shanghai can be said to be a factory for producing dancers. In addition to being distributed to dance halls throughout the city, they also have to supply the needs of other cities and overseas. Nearby cities such as Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou, and far away cities such as Peiping, Tianjin, Dalian, Qingdao, Hong Kong, Xiamen, and even various parts of Southeast Asia have their traces. However, Beijing, Hangzhou, and other places have successively banned dancing, and Shanghai's dance halls have also been hit by the recession. The miserable lives of these Yingying Yanyan are predictable.</p>
<h3>Dance Training School</h3>
<p>Since dancing has become a popular pastime, many people who are enthusiastic about dancing must first learn it to avoid "stumbling" on the dance floor. Those who are preparing to become dancers must first understand a few dance steps. As a result, many dancing schools and dance training schools sprang up. Now, after the correction of the police bureau, they have all been renamed "Dance Training Schools."</p>
<p>Dance training schools are mostly located in dilapidated Western-style houses or upstairs in ×× mansions. There is only a small, cramped room, without magnificent murals or exquisite lanterns, only a few half-new and old chairs, a few artistic lamps, and some scattered paper flowers, and an indispensable phonograph. They are simple and crude, and compared with the magnificent dance halls, they are worlds apart. However, the waxed floor is as smooth as in the dance halls.</p>
<p>The students there include wealthy mistresses, young ladies from humble families preparing to become dancers, clerks from foreign firms, university students, and air force personnel who are about to go abroad. There are also many girls from Changsan parlors, who also come there to learn to dance because business is not good, and they want to work as dancers as well. There are also many small clerks who are not very wealthy, or young masters who are tired of playing in dance halls, who also come here to pursue pleasure even though they already know how to dance.</p>
<p>There are so-called "professors" and "assistant teachers" there. If you spend 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, you can learn and study under their guidance. At first, you are guided by the assistant teacher, and when you reach a certain level, the "professor" personally takes the stage. The so-called courses usually only include a few types such as "foxtrot," "blues," and "waltz." As for learning other steps, you have to pay extra.</p>
<p>When the students' dancing skills have made some progress, men and women can temporarily act as partners and dance there. At this time, those students who are preparing to become dancers do their best to seduce the male students. When they are about to leave the training school, they will brazenly say to you: "Help me out."</p>
<h3>Dancing Professors Come from Dance Hostess Backgrounds</h3>
<p>After these "prospective dancers" complete their training, they are mostly introduced to dance halls by the training school. Fortunately, the professors there are mostly dance hostesses who have fallen behind, and it is not difficult for them to introduce one or two dancers. The "professors" often boast: "Look, red dance stars like ×× were all trained here!" In fact, what they learn there are only a few simple and superficial steps, because professors from dance hostess backgrounds cannot truly understand the art of dancing. As for these so-called "assistant teachers," they are even more ridiculous. They are mostly declining young masters: they cannot hold a pen to write, nor can they carry a load, so they can only appear as disguised "dance men" and serve others.</p>
<p>In the past, dance training schools were slightly more commercial in nature, and also had names such as tea dances and evening dances. In addition to the prescribed learning time, students who wanted to participate in dancing could buy a few practice tickets, which were actually a disguised form of dance tickets. At that time, in the dance halls, one yuan could only buy three or five dances, while the practice tickets of the training school could buy as many as sixteen. As a result, many friends who knew how to calculate rushed to it, and the small room was filled with pairs of men and women hugging each other. Many female students temporarily acted as dancers, because the tuition fees they paid were very low, or even completely free, so this was an obligation they had to fulfill. "Dancing is one of the eight major arts. If you can't dance, you are missing a page in the history of human social interaction." Although dance training schools used this sentence to promote and appeal, some people regarded it as a "holy land" for social interaction, a "paradise" for flirting, and a marriage agency.</p>
<p>(The image below is of the Xian Rong Dance Palace in those years)</p>
<h3>The Sunset is Infinitely Beautiful, but Only Near Dusk: The Declining Dance Halls</h3>
<p>Within the dance industry, it is also a situation where the back waves push the front waves. After the dance halls that have lost their appeal fall, new dance halls are quickly established. Currently, there are 27 dance halls registered with the Municipal Police Bureau in Shanghai, with more than 1,800 dancers. They are the gilded dens that adorn the prosperity of the city.</p>
<p>The International Hotel, towering on the side of the racecourse, has an extremely luxurious dance hall, which holds tea dances every Sunday. However, it does not provide dancers, so you must bring your own female companion. Its noble style and courteous service can look down on other dance halls, and its high food prices are also unmatched by others.</p>
<p>The Paramount on Yu Garden Road is promoted as the most luxurious dance hall in the Far East. Indeed, when the building was first completed, the glass floor of the dance floor was unique. The Ciro's on Jing'an Temple Road was originally the private social venue of Mr. Yuan Xun, and was later rented by Xie Baosheng and converted into a commercial dance hall. In terms of interior and exterior, it is worthy of the words "luxurious," but unfortunately the dance floor is too small, and it feels like there is no room to maneuver when there are too many people.</p>
<p>The Lido Dance Hall on Metcalfe Road was originally the residence of a wealthy Shanghai merchant. In addition to the large dance floor, there is also a magnificent hotel, an exquisite garden, and a swimming pool next to it. The Metropolitan on Gordon Road is also known for its garden dance hall, with a circular classical dance floor, an open-air green garden dance floor, winding flower paths, and a golf course. The various facilities are similar to those of the Lido. The Vienna, which is far away from the Metropolitan, is also very sophisticated in its facilities. Not far north of the Metropolitan is also a New Xianlin, which is also converted from a garden residence, with some scenic beauty.</p>
<p>The Dahua on Avenue Edward VII and the Dahu, which faces the racecourse, are both very old dance halls. In the past, there was a period when they were very popular. The Small Metropolitan next to the Dahu is so small that it can be said to be true to its name. Before the war, it and the Dahu specialized in sailor business. The earliest hotels that also operated dance halls were the Datong and the Yangzi. The Yangzi was famous for its spring floor, and the Datong was not weak either. Now, on Tibet Road, there are dance halls attached to hotels everywhere, such as the Far East and the Santa Fe, which are all located on the lower floors of hotels. Even the Weida on Avenue Joffre also operates a dance business.</p>
<p>Among the 27 dance halls in the city, the majority of their patrons are from the business world. In the past, when the speculation craze was at its peak, brokers could earn millions with just a lift of their hands, and they were naturally not stingy with supporting and rewarding the dancers. But in years of economic downturn, they also have little interest in this. As for other "nobles" and "young masters," they are just slightly decorating the facade. When the business of dance halls plummeted, everyone was thinking of ways to attract customers. The large dance halls tried their best to attract red stars to attract dance guests. Some of them were temporary guest appearances, but they could earn at least several million at a time. In the past, there was a advertising war, competing to publish the names of dance stars in large fonts in newspapers to attract customers. Now this trend is popular again.</p>
<p>Singing is also a good business tool. This is a mobile advertisement in the dance hall. Several red singers rush to different venues, and their monthly income is considerable, and the venue benefits a lot. In addition, special programs such as martial arts and comic plays are also very popular in dance halls, and the fee is limited, but the guests like them very much.</p>
<p>Several dance halls combine tea dances and tea room dances into one. In the past, you had to brew tea twice, but now you only brew it once, and you can play from 2 pm to 7 pm continuously. Customers who enjoy this are getting a lot of benefits.</p>
<h3>The Distorted Business of the Metropolis: The Shanghai Dance Girl Investigation Bureau</h3>
<p>The flourishing of dance is a distorted development in a metropolis. Furthermore, there are institutions that are happy with the dance industry, which are the so-called "Dance Girl Investigation Bureau" and "Preservation Institute". Suddenly, they moved their minds and attached a dance market investigation bureau. The proclaimed purpose of the bureau is to serve the society and seek happiness for the people, which can be removed "bright and upright." In the 30th year of the Republic of China, a "Dance Girl Investigation Bureau" appeared, which was managed by the Chinese. They were mostly failed dance hall people or declining dance hall "filial sons", and they actually came up with a new business.</p>
<p>The business scope of the investigation bureau: (1) Investigate their children for families. Young people who are not familiar with the world are most easily corrupted in Shanghai. There are many young people in dance halls who are still studying or have just entered society, and therefore abandon their studies. Parents can entrust the bureau to investigate in order to understand their secrets, and can also supervise them on their behalf. (2) Investigate their husbands for wives. In many families, husbands often dance, fall in love, and even abandon the "yellow-faced woman" at home. Wives, in order to prevent problems before they happen, can entrust the bureau to investigate their husbands' whereabouts outside. Similarly, husbands can also ask the bureau to investigate if they suspect that their wives are socializing and dancing outside. (3) Investigate their dance girls for customers. Customers falling in love with dance girls is common in today's dance halls, but the bureau can find out all the secrets about the dance girl's background, who is "supporting" her, whether she has a "trailer", and whether she is dealing with customers for their money, so as not to lead to various deteriorating situations. (4) Investigate their dance guests for dance girls. In Shanghai, there are slippery dance girls, and there are also dance guests who are at the forefront of slipping. Often, as soon as they enter the dance hall, they look generous, and dance girls are easily deceived by them and lose their bodies. Dance girls who want to investigate the background of dance guests can also ask the investigation bureau to provide services.</p>
<p>The fees of the investigation bureau are calculated by time. In the past, the general handling fee was 50 yuan, plus a public fee of 20 yuan was enough. If the investigation procedure is more complicated and cannot be completed within a week, the fee will also increase proportionally.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a slippery world. Only those who can use their brains can make a fortune. The Dance Girl Investigation Bureau is nothing more than for legal tender, and it can only exist in the distorted society of Shanghai. It is true that "strange things happen everywhere, but only in Shanghai are there more."</p>
<h3>Dancing for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>"If you don't use women as a gimmick, how would the money in the miser's purse fly out?"</p>
<p>Don't think that dancing is a kind of entertainment, a kind of consumption. Dancers also want to do a little responsibility for society. Our country is a country with many disasters and difficulties. In the past, when the wave of saving the country was singing high into the clouds, some people even shouted the slogan "dancing to save the country." Although dancing cannot save the country, dancers can call for something when there is something to do for disaster relief. This year's sensational Shanghai Miss Election also had a dance star group, which benefited the refugees in northern Jiangsu a lot.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai Miss Election, the dance star group was relatively simple. The participants were only Guan Minli, Li Zhenzhen, and Gu Lihua. Li and Gu temporarily did not participate in the election, so Guan Minli became the only one. However, the power of the appeal was not reduced because there was only one person left. Guan Minli still got 23,150 votes and won the queen's throne. The runner-up queen belonged to Gu Lihua.</p>
<p>Although there were not many dancers participating in the Miss Shanghai election, they had held a charity dance in advance to respond to the relief of refugees in northern Jiangsu. Each dance hall designated a day for charity dance and charity sale. On that day, the dance tickets earned by the dancers and the tea money sold in the dance halls were all used as donations. As a result, nine dancers, including Xu Qinfang, won type A medals, among which Zhou Lijuan and Ye Meimei also won special souvenirs. Eighteen people, including Li Zhenzhen, won type B medals. On the dance hall side, nine companies, including MGM, Dahua, Ciro's, Queen, Dalu, Far East, Gaofeng, Small Metropolitan, and Guolian, won honorary certificates, which were awarded at the lively scene of the Shanghai Miss Election on August 20.</p>
<p>It is not a new idea to raise donations by using dance girls as a gimmick. It has been done many times in the past, but this year it was particularly lively. This grand event is viewed with mixed praise and criticism by the general public. Those who agree say: they have a warm heart for disaster relief and a charitable heart, and they have demonstrated the spirit of human mutual assistance. But there are also many sarcastic and ironic words that hit their ears. They say: If you don't use women as a gimmick, how would the money in the miser's purse fly out? But on the other hand, such a great appeal is indeed worthy of looking down on men. No wonder there is a sense of "then all the parents in the world will not value sons, but value daughters."</p>

<h3>Observations of a Certain Banker: The Financial Crisis is About to Pass, Ample Deposit Reserves Can Avoid Accidents</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] A reporter recently visited a certain banker and inquired about the general situation of the financial community. The banker agreed to provide the following information: (1) The banking crisis caused by the soaring gold prices is about to pass. This incident shows the importance of adequate deposit reserves. Before the war, a 20% reserve was considered very safe; but in the current state of unstable currency values, the reserve ratio must be increased. The deposit reserves of the most reputable banks in this city exceed 50%; but the generally weaker banks, overly eager for profit, often have reserves of only 10-20%, so they cannot cope after a run on deposits. This is, in fact, the main reason for the bank's grounding, in addition to gold speculation. It is hoped that the affected bankers can accept this lesson, which will greatly benefit the stability of the financial market in the future. (2) In this large fluctuation of gold prices, the Central Bank is undoubtedly a winner, not only did it suppress gold prices, but it also had its own income. According to rough estimates, the Central Bank may have earned about 7 billion yuan in this incident. (3) Regarding the bank books for the coming year, it is heard that foreign banks have decided to cancel the jiao and fen units in order to save accounting procedures. The Bankers' Association of our country also has this suggestion, but it has not yet received the agreement of the major bankers, because on the one hand, this matter involves the national currency system, and on the other hand, jiao and fen cannot be omitted when paying direct taxes. The matter is of great importance, so it is not appropriate to make a rash decision. (4) The government's management of commercial banks next year will inevitably be strengthened, and the center of management will be to check the escape of funds to Hong Kong. These escaped funds are used to pay for imports that cannot be approved for foreign exchange. The work of the Financial Inspection Department of the Central Bank is currently very serious, but the manpower is still insufficient. If manpower can be strengthened in the future, supervising the accounting of commercial banks can also prevent the escape of funds. (5) There are rumors that a 5,000-yuan bill will be issued next year, and that the exchange rate will be revised in January. From the standpoint of the financial industry, there is no need for a 5,000-yuan bill, so this statement is undoubtedly a rumor. As for revising the exchange rate, it is theoretically necessary, but in view of the situation of stimulating prices during the last revision, it must be very cautious. As for the exact date, it is a matter of confidentiality, and everything circulated outside is just speculation.</p>
<h3>Official and Private Opinions Diverge on the Processing and Export of Domestic Silk</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the method of processing and exporting domestic silk, the views of the official and private sides have not yet been consistent. The official side hopes to provide 1,400 dan of raw silk and 2,000 boxes of rayon to be woven by private silk factories on consignment. The government will give appropriate "processing fees" according to the nature of the woven products, so that the silk factories in the precarious state can barely survive and avoid bankruptcy. The working capital required during the weaving period, amounting to about 6 billion yuan, will also be provided by the Four Banks interest-free. As for the sales of the finished products, it is entirely the government's business, and the profits and losses have nothing to do with the silk factories. From the government's standpoint, the overseas market must be maintained and cannot be interrupted. Even if there is no profit to be made, exports must continue. Moreover, processing and exporting raw silk can increase foreign exchange positions. The selling price of each dan of raw silk is about 800 US dollars, but after it is woven into silk and exported, it can get a price of about 1,500 US dollars. After deducting all necessary expenses, it can get at least 1,200 US dollars, which is very cost-effective. Regarding the private silk factories making and selling their own products, the relevant parties expressed difficulty in agreeing. The reasons are: (1) The factory is responsible for "processing," the raw materials belong to the public, and the finished products also belong to the public, so the sales should be the responsibility of the public. (2) The sales risk is very high, and if there is a loss, it is definitely not something that an organization with a capital of 500 million yuan can be responsible for; it is better for the government to handle it on its behalf. The public is focused on obtaining foreign exchange and maintaining the market, and profits and losses are not a decisive consideration, which is different from private operations. As of now, there is only agreement in principle between each other. Detailed methods are still to be discussed, and the final decision needs to be made by the administrative authorities before it can be implemented.</p>
<h3>American Commercial Ships Rank First Among Those Coming to China</h3>
<p>According to authoritative sources in the shipping industry, the commercial ships entering and leaving Chinese seaports this year (from January to August) are led by the United States, with 669 ships totaling 2,695,720 tons. The United Kingdom is second, with 826 ships totaling 1,603,561 tons. Other Japanese ships are also above the Soviet Union and rank third. However, our country's commercial ships total only 265 ships, totaling 297,882 tons, and they are all old ships. How can they compete with other countries for a day's length? It will not be until the fixed 1 million tons arrive in China that our shipping industry will have a glimmer of hope.</p>
<h3>US-Japan Trade Restores to Pre-War Levels</h3>
<p>According to important figures in the American business community in this city, trade between the United States and Japan has returned to pre-war levels, and the second half of this year has developed even more than the first half. From 1936 to 1938, the average annual exports from the United States to Japan were 20,300,000 US dollars, while imports from Japan were 13,000,000 US dollars. The above statistics include Korea and Taiwan. The total number of US exports to Japan in June 1946 was 16,900,000 US dollars, 16,900,000 US dollars in July, and 20,200,000 US dollars in August. The total number of imports from Japan in June of the same year was 14,000,000 US dollars, 11,000,000 US dollars in July, and 12,000,000 US dollars in August.</p>
<h3>Shops Make False Accounts</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs is Trying to Prevent It</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently stated that the practice of making false accounts in the business community after the war is very prevalent, which is very wrong. It is now working with relevant authorities to jointly formulate a commercial accounting law so that the accounting system of the business community can get on the right track. At the same time, it will be stipulated that if someone makes false accounts in order to deceive others, they will be punished by law according to the crime.</p>
<h3>Many Chongqing Industrial and Commercial Businesses Bankrupt, Proposed Request for Loan Relief Based on Precedent</h3>
<p>Chongqing's industrial and commercial businesses are currently struggling under the pressure of foreign goods flooding the market and slow sales. Bankruptcies and closures are frequently reported. According to tax authorities, over twenty industrial and commercial businesses in the city have closed in the past two months. With the end of the year approaching, it is difficult to predict whether more will follow. To salvage the current crisis, various industries plan to request the government to provide loans to Chongqing's industrial and commercial businesses, following the example of the Shanghai industrial and commercial loan relief program. Specific measures are currently being discussed.</p>
<h3>New and Old Year-Ends Approaching: Review of the City's Industrial and Commercial Situation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing] Today is December 30th of the 35th year of the Republic. The solar new year has arrived, and the lunar new year is only twenty days away. Looking back on the past year, industrial and commercial businesses have faced an unprecedented crisis due to currency depreciation, foreign invasion, and high-interest loans. During this year, the price of gold soared from 785,000 yuan on the opening day of January 4th to 3.3 million yuan, even reaching a record high of 3.95 million yuan. The U.S. dollar jumped from 1,385 yuan to 7,800 yuan (price on the 23rd). Although the assets of factories and shops increased with rising prices, their debts, due to high-interest exploitation, increased several times more than their assets. This year, the industrial sector faced greater difficulties than the commercial sector. The Central News Agency reporter interviewed various industrial sectors and learned that their common difficulties were: 1. Lack of raw materials, 2. High taxes, 3. Frequent labor unrest, and 4. High-interest exploitation.</p>
<p>The situation in the commercial sector is not as alarming as some reports suggest. It was previously reported that 30% of the shops on Nanjing Road would close by the end of the year, but this sensational figure seems unreliable. According to the person in charge of the Nanjing Road Businessmen's Association, "It is currently impossible to estimate the situation of the shops on Nanjing Road, but they are generally doing their best to survive the Lunar New Year. However, this period is closely related to the entire social economy. If the situation is stable, the number of closures can be reduced. Otherwise, some shops on Nanjing Road may indeed find it difficult to survive." However, the seriousness of the situation in various industries cannot be denied. Some shops on Avenue Joffre have already closed their doors, and news of company and business closures is heard every day. A portion of the city's shops will disappear with the 35th year due to weak consumer purchasing power and high-interest exploitation. However, if the city's financial situation remains calm in the last twenty days before the Lunar New Year, it will be able to save the majority of industrial and commercial businesses that are on the verge of collapse. Yesterday, the reporter interviewed the heads of more than ten businesses in the city, asking about the past year and how to survive the new and old year-ends. According to Mr. Xu Jiqing, a financial giant and chairman of the Cloth Merchants' Association, the future is not pessimistic.</p>
<p>Economic Prospects Not Pessimistic</p>
<p>According to him, "Recently, the decline in China's production capacity, the sluggishness of industry and commerce, which affected the rising prices, and the depreciation of the legal tender, and the gold rush, did not hesitate to fuel the flames, creating a panic situation, which is indeed the current reality. However, I can assert that the future situation will gradually improve, and the clouds will clear, revealing a clear sky, because the peak of recession is the eve of prosperity. Therefore, in our view, China's economic prospects are not as serious as imagined, and there will be no economic collapse. For example, the Central Bank has achieved considerable results in stabilizing gold prices. In addition, the Four Joint Offices, the Central Bank, and the newly established Temporary Review Committee for Production Enterprise Loans have successively provided large-scale loans for legitimate production. This measure will strengthen production, revitalize the economy, and reward new vitality. Regarding the prices of daily necessities and rice in this city, it is believed that Mayor Wu is determined and effective in suppressing market prices, and it is expected that they will not rise in the future."</p>
<p>Money Shops Expected to Safely Pass the Year-End</p>
<p>Shen Rixin, Chairman of the Money Shop Association, believes that money shops will definitely be able to safely pass the year-end. The recent surge in gold prices and tightening of credit had minimal impact on the industry. According to him, the most worrying thing at the time was the sudden reduction in interbank lending. Fortunately, it was short-lived and has now improved. Moreover, the Silver and Money Industry Joint Reserve Association has issued treasury bills for the assets paid by the industry as reserves, such as real estate, after evaluation and registration in the Land Administration Bureau. These bills can be used to apply for interbank lending from the association at the prevailing interbank rate for regulation. He also stated that there are currently 72 member money shops in the city, including the three companies Yong Sheng, Yong Qing, and Yi Feng, which moved from the mainland, and the four companies that have been approved by the Ministry of Finance and are about to resume operations. It is expected that the end of this year will be safely passed. And all the shops can have a surplus. As for the market turmoil, what this industry feels is that there are few stores that are owed compared to those that save and trade commercially. If it is a short-term loan, it will not be greatly restricted.</p>
<p>Wool and Velvet Industry Doing Well, Department Stores Lamenting Hardship</p>
<p>As for the various commercial sectors, they are not necessarily all affected by the social and economic downturn. For example, the wool and velvet industry has been able to safely pass this year. On the contrary, department stores and restaurants are suffering, especially the restaurant industry, where more than 60% are losing money. According to the person in charge of the Restaurant Industry Association, more than 60% to 70% of the more than 500 restaurants that have joined the association are losing money. More than ten have applied for closure in the past half month, which shows the general operating conditions. The person in charge also said: "High-interest loans are the fatal wound of this industry, and the heavy taxes are also a factor. Each restaurant has to bear six types of taxes, including business tax, income tax, profit tax, stamp tax, and license tax, which invisibly increases the price of food. The business is therefore more affected. Their only hope is that the collection of banquet donations will still be handled in accordance with the standards set by the National Government, so that the business may improve slightly. As for the year-end, some will be able to survive with difficulty, but the number of those forced to close down may not be small. The department store industry is also sluggish. It can be said that the larger ones are already in a state of marking down prices. According to the person in charge of the association, their member stores generally suffer from low purchasing power, so business is very sluggish. During the price surge in September and October, they generally tried to purchase as much goods as possible, even borrowing high-interest loans to buy them. But in fact, the goods that were originally expected to be sold in two or three months have not been sold out after five or six months. Now, on the one hand, the business situation is not good, and on the other hand, they have to pay high-interest rates, so most of them are lamenting hardship. They hope that the government can provide low-interest loans. As for the year-end, although it is in extreme difficulty, they are trying their best to find ways to survive.</p>
<p>Except for some shops in the wool and velvet industry that closed down in the first half of the year, the general situation is now very good. There are 63 members in the association. According to the person in charge of the association, the profit margin of wool and velvet is very thin. There is no feeling of threat to supply this year, and the supply and demand are balanced. In particular, the price has always been stable, without huge fluctuations. There is no problem at the year-end, and they can all pass it safely. There are 300 members in the watch and clock industry association. The general business is very good. The watches and clocks sold on the market are all automatically imported by Americans, so the watch and clock industry has not directly ordered goods from abroad since April this year. Although the year-end is coming, they can all pass it safely in the sluggish business environment.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth and Pigment Situation is Better</p>
<p>The situation of the cotton cloth industry is still good this year. According to the person in charge of the association, the business situation has been good for most of the time except for the past month, which has been worse. The industry association had only 800 members last year, but recently it has increased to 1,400. Generally, those who are more financially sound can cope, and only a few who use interest are relatively worse off. However, 90% of the industry can survive, and only a few need to see how the overall economic situation is before the Lunar New Year to decide their fate. The business situation of pigment merchants is much better than other industries. The association originally had 184 members. There have been new openings and closures this year. Now there are about 200 members. The business situation is that most of the supply cannot meet the demand because there are not many sources of supply. Before the war, the sources of pigments were all ordered from abroad from American, Hengqi, Bao, and foreign firms. Now these firms have all closed down, so the current sources of supply completely rely on the enemy property management office to auction the enemy property pigments of the Detfu Foreign Firm. There are also many imports of American pigments. They hope that the import management committee can help them handle foreign exchange settlement and purchase goods to facilitate the sources of supply.</p>
<p>Prosperous Imports, Sluggish Exports</p>
<p>The import and export industry in this city, the importers are naturally prosperous in all the "Westernization", and the profits are also higher than the general commercial industry, while the export industry is bleak and lifeless. According to the person in charge of the Import and Export Industry Business Association, the import of goods in this city was quite enthusiastic before the promulgation of the import management measures on November 17th. Daily necessities were imported, and cotton and automobiles were the most numerous. After the promulgation of the import management measures, the government stipulated that all goods below 2,000 US dollars can be freely requested for import; goods above 2,000 US dollars must be submitted to the Imported Goods Management Committee for approval before import. The import industry was still prosperous in the 35th year, and the profits were still not bad. However, the export industry was not doing well. The main export goods were tung oil and pig bristles, with a monthly output of 2,000 tons in peak months and about 1,000 tons in off-peak months. Our country's silk and tea were also major export products, but the situation was very bad this year. The association authorities hope that there will be new agricultural development next year, and hope that import companies will take into account the actual needs of the country and society, import daily necessities and production equipment, and minimize the import of luxury goods. The export industry is bleak, and it is hoped that the government will provide assistance and encouragement in terms of capital transportation. Furthermore, Southeast Asia was originally our country's export market, and cloth and general daily necessities can be promoted, but in recent years, it has been taken away by India, and it is urgent to rise up and catch up to restore the old appearance, which is the main plan of the export industry in the coming year. The real estate business this year can be said to be one of the years with the least transactions in recent decades. According to the person in charge of the association, since the central government clearly stipulated that real estate is prohibited from being leased or mortgaged, all business has plummeted. Now the municipal government stipulates that all real estate, etc. should be priced according to the price in the 26th year of the Republic of China, and pay 15/1000 of the land price multiplied by 400 times. If it is an inheritance, inheritance tax is often paid. At this time of declining people's livelihood and heavy taxes, if you want to sell, no one will buy it, so it has caused a year-long stagnation. There is no way to break the deadlock.</p>
<p>The construction industry is related to the real estate industry. Since the real estate cannot be active, it affects the construction. In addition, according to the person in charge of the association, there are three main reasons: (1) The industrial and commercial sectors are declining, and they are unable to build large-scale high-rise buildings and larger factories. All major projects rely solely on a part of the government's infrastructure construction, such as repairing roads and building and repairing airfields. (2) If the owner of the contracted project is a private enterprise, such as the owner going bankrupt in the middle due to business losses, the contracted construction company will definitely be implicated. (3) Under the circumstances of constant fluctuations in prices and workers' living standards, it is not easy to contract for construction or labor. If the estimated price is too high, no one will be interested; if the estimated price is too low, it will be a loss. More often, the correct price has been estimated to the owner and a contract has been signed. After the start of construction, prices suddenly rise, or workers request to change their wages, which will undoubtedly be a loss. Therefore, it is difficult to maintain the situation where it is not easy to find customers, and it is even more difficult to contract. According to statistics, only Baohua Construction Company, Tao Guiji Construction Factory, and Chengtai Construction Company can maintain. 60% to 70% of the entire industry is already difficult to support.</p>
<p>Talking About the Cigarette Industry - Drawing Inferences</p>
<p>In terms of industry this year, except for the cotton textile industry, all have the feeling of being difficult to maintain. Due to time constraints, the reporter was unable to interview the industry associations of various industries, but the general situation of the serious industries in this city can be seen from the various industries such as cigarette making, leather making, and knitting that were visited. In the second half of the year, the cigarette industry suffered from high-interest loans and sluggish business. Several companies even went bankrupt. According to Dai Gengxin, Chairman of the Cigarette Industry Association, and Zhao Erchang, Secretary of the Association, the biggest difficulties currently faced by the industry include four major points: (1) Lack of raw material sources, (2) Exploitation of high-interest loans, (3) High taxes, (4) Labor unrest. Recently, it has been learned that the government will adjust the tax amount due to the rise in cigarette prices. The cigarette industry really cannot afford it, so it was decided to send Bao Gengsheng (Lixing Cigarette Factory), Shen Kunshan (Yizhong Cigarette Factory), Jin Yigeng (Huamei Cigarette Factory), Li Zitang (Guohua Cigarette Factory), Zhang Yuwen (Greater Southeast), and Guo Keyong (Nanyang Cigarette Factory) to Beijing by overnight train on the 27th to help the Tax Affairs Administration to appeal, requesting a temporary exemption from adjusting the tax consideration. At the same time, a temporary meeting of all members was convened at 3 pm on the 26th to discuss the workers' year-end bonus, which will be one month's salary per person to show encouragement, and to take unified action, and no arbitrary additions or subtractions are allowed.</p>
<p>Leather and Knitting Both Without Improvement</p>
<p>According to Zhang Shanzhang, Chairman of the Leather Industry Association, the leather industry has not improved after the war. The main reason is that foreign goods are flooding the market and dumping at low prices, which has caused a major blow to the domestic leather industry. Secondly, the wages are too high, which affects the production cost, and some have closed down because they cannot afford it. Furthermore, the tax rate set by the government is too high, which makes production and sales difficult, and the cost is heavy. The more than 300 leather industries under the exploitation of high-interest loans feel even more breathless; therefore, they hope that the government will implement three points: (1) Reduce the tax rate to the same tax as people's livelihood products and the cotton textile industry; (2) Please issue low-interest loans; (3) Prohibit the import of foreign soles and increase the import tax rate on foreign leather.</p>
<p>The knitting industry includes three types: silk stockings, underwear, and clothing. The general business has not improved. According to the person in charge of the association, especially the factories that accumulate silk and rayon are even more miserable due to the dumping of glass stockings, which has led to many closures. As for the reasons for the blow to the entire knitting industry, it is also nothing more than high-interest exploitation, too high costs, foreign dumping, and weak purchasing power. At the same time, the restriction of electricity and the source of raw materials are also extremely difficult. During the Lunar New Year, most people feel difficult to make ends meet. However, they are all willing to do their best to support so as not to affect the social economy and production industry. They all hope that the government will provide low-interest loans. However, there has been no news of industrial and commercial loans being granted to the knitting industry. At the same time, the industry also hopes that the authorities can allocate raw materials and abolish electricity restrictions to increase production."</p>
<h3>China's Wartime Losses Estimated at Over 50 Billion US Dollars</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] It is reported that the total direct losses suffered by China during the war are estimated to be worth 30 billion US dollars, and the total indirect losses are estimated to be worth 20 billion US dollars. The total losses suffered by industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises are estimated to be worth 4 billion US dollars. The government will recently send personnel to Japan to dismantle some industrial equipment as part of Japan's war reparations to China.</p>
<h3>Bankruptcies Plague Hankou: 1,200 Stores Closed in the Past Month</h3>
<p>As the end of the year approaches, the wind of financial and industrial bankruptcies in Hankou is getting worse. According to the Hankou Municipal Government, from the beginning of last month to mid-December, a total of 1,262 stores closed in Hankou, with a total loss of 3.1976 billion yuan. This includes 10 banks and silver shops, 4 oil and salt shops, 7 clothing and fabric shops, 13 grain shops, 22 hardware and grocery shops, 29 restaurants, 6 gold and silver shops, 11 construction companies, 12 hotels and freight forwarding companies, 10 cigarette shops, 3 fuel shops, 3 barber shops, 2 watch shops, 2 seafood shops, 8 daily necessities shops, 1 stationery shop, 1 paint shop, and 18 other shops.</p>
<h3>Industrial, Mining, and Transportation Enterprises Revalue Fixed Assets: Method to Adjust Capital: New Capital Cannot Be Added If Old Capital is Not Adjusted</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Pan Xulun, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs, specially hosted the local news media at the conference room of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday to announce the "Method for Revaluing Fixed Assets and Adjusting Capital of Industrial, Mining, and Transportation Enterprises", which was recently passed by the Standing Committee of the National Defense Supreme Committee, consisting of ten items, and added a report, stating: Regarding the methods for assisting production enterprises, the relevant government authorities have recently studied many plans under the leadership of President Song. However, it is found that the general concept of assisting production enterprises in all sectors is nothing more than borrowing loans from the government. However, the accumulated loans have caused the government to suffer unbearable burdens, and industrial and commercial businesses are just like drinking poison to quench their thirst, which is by no means a thorough solution. Therefore, the Ministry has repeatedly discussed how to concentrate market idle funds into the production industry. The reason why idle funds are unwilling to concentrate in the production industry is that the poor conditions of the production industry are one of the reasons. However, if the old capital is not adjusted, the new capital will not be added. The National Defense Supreme Committee has taken this into consideration, and then passed this method, which will be implemented immediately. It is found that this method was already considered in the rear during the Anti-Japanese War. If the capital before the war is not revalued, the following drawbacks will occur: (1) The accounts cannot be accurate. (2) Depreciation cannot be made. (3) The capital cannot be increased, which will only increase the tax burden, and there is a drawback of virtual profit and real tax. Therefore, in the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the production industry in the rear requested the government to allow the fixed assets to be revalued. However, considering the identity of the general civil servants and the government's tax revenue, it did not work out in the end. Now that the domestic currency value has not stabilized after the victory, it has been decided to re-determine the method of government valuation.</p>
<p>Mr. Pan continued to explain the main points of the method. The scope is temporarily limited to industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises. As for finance and commerce, they are not included. The government has two concerns: (1) The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Accounting believe that the recent issue of bank deposits and creditors requesting to be repaid twice the amount of deposits before the war has not yet been resolved. Now, if the financial industry is rashly allowed to revalue, it will implicitly support the creditors' position. (2) According to the provisions of Article 7 of the method, it can invisibly force a large amount of cash idle funds in the society to invest in the production industry so as to enrich the foundation of the enterprise itself. However, the government will never expect idle funds to concentrate in the commercial sector, so as not to encourage speculation and manipulation.</p>
<p>As for the multiple of increasing capital, it is now decided to use half of the national wholesale price index compiled by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the 35th year of the Republic of China as the criterion for calculation. According to Mr. Pan's estimate, the index in the 35th year of the Republic of China is 3,500 times, and half of it is 1,750 times. This is the highest amount for calculation. If it is not easy to raise new shares as a result, the multiple can still be reduced automatically. However, some people think that the multiple is too small. However, Mr. Pan believes that if the valuation is too high, it will easily lead to danger when prices stabilize in the future.</p>
<p>As for production enterprises other than industrial, mining, and transportation, such as fishery and agriculture, they can apply the provisions of Article 10 of the method. However, another feature of this method is that the Ministry of Finance previously believed that the increase in assets was an investment gain and should be taxed in accordance with the law. Now, it is stipulated that the asset value increased by revaluing fixed assets in accordance with this method is specially allowed not to be considered as an income gain and is exempt from income tax and excessive profit tax. Now this set of valuation and capital increase regulations is limited to one time. In the future, it is hoped that the currency value will tend to stabilize, so that there will be no more changes. As to whether the production industry will be saved as a result of the implementation of this method, it still depends on the success or failure of the cooperation of other factors, and it cannot be relied on solely on this method. The full text of the ten articles of the method is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) When an industrial, mining, or transportation enterprise has one of the following circumstances, it may revalue its original fixed assets to adjust its capital amount.</p>
<p>1. When the original capital is insufficient for operation and turnover due to the impact of prices, and new shares need to be raised.</p>
<p>2. When expanding the business and raising new shares are required.</p>
<p>3. When merging with other organizations and readjusting capital is required. The revaluation and capital increase in the preceding paragraph is limited to one time and must be completed within the 36th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>(2) The industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises stipulated in the preceding article are limited to those that have been registered with the competent authority.</p>
<p>(3) The various fixed assets of industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises, except for land, shall be based on their original purchase price, minus the residual value obtained by depreciation and loss up to the 34th year.</p>
<p>The maximum limit of the revaluation price is obtained by multiplying the remaining price in the preceding paragraph by half the multiple of the national wholesale price index in the 35th year and the index for the same year of purchase. The calculation formula is as follows: current price.</p>

<h3>Ninety Minutes Without a Goal - Youyou Draws with Qingbai Again</h3>
<p>Youyou Defends Strenuously While Qingbai Attacks Ineffectively</p>
<p>In the Jia Group match of the League, Qingbai met Youyou again, facing off yesterday afternoon at the Yiyuan. Although the weather was cold, the sun shone brightly, so more than 6,000 spectators attended, making the atmosphere enthusiastic. The two teams drew 1-1 in the first round. Although Qingbai no longer has much hope for the championship, they made every effort to defeat Youyou in order to maintain their reputation, but the result was still not as desired. Instead, the two teams shook hands with a score of 0-0. Li Yichen missed a penalty kick in the first half, which was an unfavorable omen. Although Youyou had no hope of winning, they were fortunate to have forced a draw last time. They also had confidence in not losing in yesterday's match, and their ideal was realized, so Youyou can be satisfied.</p>
<p>Li Yichen Misses a Penalty Kick</p>
<p>The match was refereed by Jiang Yin-seng, and both sides lacked brilliant performances. Qingbai's Qu Yongfu and Xiao Luo have not returned from Hong Kong, and A'Gui was absent. The new players filling in on both wings were virtually useless. Fortunately, the defense was solid, so they remained impeccable. Youyou knew it would not be easy to attack the enemy's headquarters directly, so they defended more than they attacked. The 90 minutes passed in a chaotic situation, with each side attacking and defending without any success. In the first half, Qingbai's attack was fierce, and Lazy Cow knocked on the door several times, but they all went out of bounds. Youyou's Lati performed brilliantly. In the 33rd minute, Wang Nanzhen fouled in the penalty area. Referee Jiang Yin-seng awarded a penalty kick. Li Yichen took the kick with great force, but it was saved by Lati. This missed goal dampened Qingbai's spirit, and Youyou became more rampant, but they also failed to achieve anything. The first half ended 0-0, with neither side scoring.</p>
<p>Youyou Concentrates on Defending Vigorously</p>
<p>In the second half, Youyou's lineup remained the same. Qingbai made major changes to the front line. Xiao Jiang Jing Lin-gui changed to playing center forward, Li Yichen played as left winger, Song Ling-sheng played as right inside forward, Xiao Gu played as right winger, and Fei Chunhua replaced Chen Wei-zhi. However, after these adjustments, there was still no improvement. Youyou concentrated on defending vigorously. Qingbai had four decisive corner kicks, but they also achieved nothing. Midway through the second half, Li Yichen unintentionally kicked Lati in the abdomen, causing a momentary uproar among the spectators. Fortunately, Lati recovered quickly, and the fans were relieved. After the two teams entered the second half, they acted cautiously, so no further incidents occurred. The match ended with a pair of zeros in a relaxed atmosphere of back-and-forth play. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Qingbai</p>
<p>Qin Bi-gao</p>
<p>Yan Shi-xin Wu Qi-xiang</p>
<p>Gao Bao-zheng Meng Yi-liang Zhang Feng-gang</p>
<p>Fei Chun-hua Chen Wei-zhi Song Ling-sheng Li Yi-chen Gu Yi-che Jing Lin-gui</p>
<p>Youyou</p>

Instead, the Soviet Union scored three more goals in a row, resulting in the Soviet Union defeating Longjie by a score of 9-0. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In the University Football League, the specialist group match between the Tax Academy and Nantong took place at 12:30 PM yesterday, and the university group match between Aurora University and Datong University took place at 2:30 PM, both at the Jiaotong University Stadium. As a result, the Tax Academy and Nantong drew with a score of 2-2, and Datong suffered a 3-1 defeat to Aurora University, avoiding a shutout. The match details are as follows:</p>
<p>Tax Academy Draws with Nantong</p>
<p>At 12:30 PM, the specialist group match between the Tax Academy and Nantong took place at the Jiaotong University Stadium, with a large audience and good order. Ten minutes after the start of the match, the Tax Academy's forward penetrated into Nantong's territory, and Dai Yanling crossed the ball, which Feng Yili powerfully struck into the goal, giving the Tax Academy a 1-0 lead. Nantong launched a full counterattack and, two minutes before the end of the first half, Wang Huaiting scored, tying the score 1-1 at the end of the first half. In the second half, the Tax Academy launched another fierce attack, and after eight minutes, Feng Yili repeated his previous feat, scoring again, giving the Tax Academy a 2-1 lead. The players from Nantong were unwilling to give up, and after thirty-five minutes, Li Baoye scored with a long shot, tying the score again at 2-2, and the result was a draw.</p>

<p>Aurora University Defeats Datong</p>
<p>The university group match between Aurora University and Datong followed. With the cheers of the cheerleading squad, the entire Aurora University team bravely attacked. In particular, Skilo, who was tall and had long arms, and was carrying a white handkerchief, was excellent at heading and dribbling the ball. Before long, Chai Weier crossed the ball, and Datong's defender missed the ball with his leg. Aurora University's Han Mingxi rushed forward and kicked the ball into the goal from under Datong's goalkeeper, scoring the first goal. Datong's morale was immediately dampened. Defender Xu Pinjie became angry and fouled a player inside the penalty area, resulting in a free kick. Aurora University's Wu Junlin took the free kick, and the ball flew into the goal from the corner, giving Aurora University a 2-0 lead at halftime. In the second half, the players from both sides changed their formations and continued to fight. Yu Xiqing had excellent footwork, but Aurora University's goalkeeper, Sitikoff, was tall and quick. Datong's attacks became more intense, and the entire team moved forward, leaving the defense empty. Aurora University's Chen Yuwei found an opportunity to break through and scored a goal, giving Aurora University an absolute advantage with a score of 3-0. Before the end of the match, Datong's Yu Xiqing made a powerful kick, and the ball was low and fast. Sitikoff was unable to bend down in time, and the ball rolled into the goal from under his feet. As a result, Datong avoided a shutout and lost to Aurora University by a score of 3-1. The lineups for both teams are as follows:</p>

<h3>New Seabed Map Being Drawn: Report from the American Geographical Society</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chicago, 28th] The American Geographical Society held its annual meeting today, and experts presented papers on topics such as tsunamis and the depth of the western Pacific Ocean. Dr. Hibbert, a member of the Scripps Oceanographic Institution, said that a new instrument has been designed that can record the depth of tsunamis and provide warnings hours before the tides arrive. Professor Hayes, a professor of marine geography at Princeton University, said that the depth of the western Pacific Ocean is greater than previously imagined. Detailed measurements of the western Pacific during the war revealed many other facts. A new seabed map is being drawn.</p>

<h3>A Tour of the Huainan Coal Mines</h3>
<p>— Wuhu, 20th News, Our Special Correspondent Kang Feng</p>
<p>These two places: Datong and Jiulonggang, if you have visited the Huainan coal mining area, you will know that these are two glittering gems.</p>
<p>Datong Coal Mine started growing in the third year of the Republic of China. More than 20 mines were excavated, but no coal was found. The funds were exhausted, and even the food for dozens of workers could not be provided. The founder, Xia Lüping, had operated coal mines in Qinhuangdao, Liujiang, and other places. He was convinced that coal could be mined in Datong. He sold a steel cable (worth several thousand yuan) to support the workers' food and make a final gamble. Finally, with the support of the food maintained by the proceeds of the sale of the steel cable, they found a coal seam. Datong Coal Mine Company raised capital funds (2 million yuan), and the funds promoted production. Datong coal production began the history of Huainan coal mines, reaching a peak output of 1,800 tons per day before the War of Resistance against Japan.</p>
<p>Datong and Jiulonggang</p>
<p>In the 19th year of the Republic of China, the Huainan Coal Mine Bureau began mining the coal seam in Jiulonggang, five kilometers east of Datong. Hu Weizhong (the police chief at the time, and now the deputy director of the Huainan Railway Bureau) said, "When we arrived at Jiulonggang, there were only six households in this place, and five and a half of them were bandits."</p>
<p>This desolate village developed into a small town of 30,000 people in the 26th year of the Republic of China. In addition, there were also new villages for miners, workshops, etc. The peak of Huainan coal production reached 2,700 tons per day.</p>
<p>In the winter of the 26th year of the Republic of China, when the Japanese invaders approached, Deputy Director Hu Weizhong was responsible for the final destruction of the mine and roads. The railway was destroyed section by section from Yuxikou to Tianjia'an (Yuxikou is the terminal of the Huainan Railway, diagonally across the Yangtze River from Wuhu; Tianjia'an is on the south bank of the Huai River and is the starting point). He sighed and left. Hu Weizhong, who resembled Feng Yuxiang and spoke with a similar accent, finally returned with the reception of this destroyed railway after eight years in the rear.</p>
<p>During the eight years of occupation, the Japanese changed the route of the Huainan Railway and placed the Datong and Huainan mines under the management of their navy. In order to save gasoline, which was in short supply, for supplying fuel to the Japanese navy, these technicians from Kyushu Imperial University in Japan used methods like killing the goose to get the eggs, ravaging the mines. In order to increase production, they abandoned many coal pits after mining them poorly and opened new pits for wasteful mining. Even so, the highest daily production of the Japanese in eight years never exceeded 3,800 tons (less than the daily output of 4,500 tons from the two mines in the 26th year of the Republic of China). Naturally, the coal mined by the Japanese in eight years strangled countless Chinese soldiers and civilians. This coal powered the Jinpu Railway to transport troops to suppress the anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians in Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui. This coal powered the Japanese navy's coal-fired ships to plunder and kill our soldiers and civilians in the Yangtze River and along the coast, and to transport the captured war materials. The total amount of this coal was 7 million tons. The Japanese are beginning to repay this debt, but so far only 200,000 pit props have been delivered from Japan. The Japanese must compensate for their plunder!</p>
<p>(II) Receiving with Four National Flags</p>
<p>Engineer Zhang Youxian followed the reception route of September 34th of the Republic of China from Chongqing, Zhijiang to Nanjing, and then transferred to Bengbu, arriving at the Huainan coal mine managed by the Japanese Navy in Jiulonggang. He only brought a few assistants, and he carried four national flags.</p>
<p>He thought that the first important thing in Daodifang was to tear down the Japanese flag and replace it with the national flag that had not been seen for eight years. Little did he know that when he arrived at the mine and looked up, the Chinese flag was flying in the sky, higher than the gallows (not the execution tool for killing people, but the one used to hang coal carts in the mine shaft). The Japanese's obedience made Zhang Youxian even more careful, fearing that there was a poison hidden in the sugar coat to destroy the mine!</p>
<p>Zhang Youxian had been a diligent mine engineer in Chongqing and Guizhou for eight years. Prolonged hard work and poor nutrition in the rear almost destroyed this old youth who had been engaged in mining for 20 years. Therefore, when he arrived in Huainan to take over, he was a little sensitive. When he arrived at the mine, he had few people, and the mine area was nearly 20 kilometers in diameter. He could not manage all the mine shafts, machinery and equipment, so he put two telephones by the head of his bed and a truck at the door to control the overall situation. One of the two telephones connected to the Tianjia'an Power Plant. He could not allow any problems at the power plant. If the power plant broke down, the water pumps in the mine would stop working, and the mine water would flood the mine. The other telephone connected to the Datong Mine. He had to control this largest producing mine area and pay attention to its survival at all times.</p>
<p>Soon, Deputy Director Xie Fangan arrived, and Zhang Youxian's hard work was partially transferred to this chubby northerner. However, the chubby deputy director's blood pressure rose rapidly due to the mine's takeover and management, from 140, 150 to 180. This middle-aged man in his fifties fought against cold calculations and open shots from all sides to protect the Huainan industry. Their wit and means naturally achieved safe results. It was not until January of this year that the mine's manpower gradually supplemented and was equipped and used satisfactorily. It was not until April 20 that the last two Japanese technicians left.</p>
<p>In addition to the coal areas and tunnels that were dug out, the original appearance of the mine was not damaged at all thanks to the strict supervision of these two supervisors against the Japanese and the expected hands of the puppet army. However, the production of huge amounts of coal only started this year with the gradual increase in manpower, because what the Japanese left behind was a barren wasteland where everything had to be started from scratch!

<h3>Visiting the Tianjia'an Power Plant</h3>
<p>If the Huainan Mine Road system is called an industrial giant, the Huainan Power Plant located in Tianjia'an on the south bank of the Huai River can be compared to the brain or heart of this giant. Early this morning, I was led to see the power plant. There is currently a motor in this power plant that is roaring and turning. Steel barbed wire surrounds this two-story building made of cement and steel bones that houses the motor. Upstairs are the generator room and the distribution panel room. Downstairs are the coal loading machine, boiler, electric pump, water pump, etc. This generator consumes 60 tons of black rice (coal) every day (24 hours), which is mined with the help of its power, and then generates 2,000 kilowatts of electricity, which is transmitted through high-voltage wires with a diameter of one inch to any place in the mine road area that needs electricity.</p>
<p>Although this power plant is loud, there are only a few people working inside. The entire plant has only 200 people, including the small workers. Li Rongbao, the head of the electrical department, sits in the distribution panel room upstairs every day. This thin and tall head of the power plant was originally a power plant technician. Twenty years of practical work and the theoretical knowledge he acquired through self-study made him more than qualified to be the director of a power plant today.</p>
<p>A new motor has already been transported to the open space downstairs in the power plant. This motor can also generate 2,000 kilowatts of electricity. It was originally promised to be sold to the Dujiang Power Plant in Guanxian County, Sichuan by an American company. However, because the Huainan Coal Mine has performed so well this year in urgently supplying the light needed in Beijing and Shanghai, the Executive Yuan gave it priority as a reward for this mining area. In fact, this motor still requires a huge investment. The person who accompanied me said that it was 27 priorities, which of course had to be deducted from the coal price provided by this mining area in the future. From all sides, I heard that the motor originally allocated to the Dujiang Power Plant was transported to the Huainan Coal Mine, which caused a big quarrel. The people in the Huainan Mine thought that the central government would probably not be biased in these matters, and that quarreling would be useless. After this new motor is installed, it will naturally increase the production of Huainan coal. When winter strikes the rich Yangtze River Delta, the day and night power generation of the Huainan Power Plant will not only illuminate the dark mining area, but also transmit heat to the beautiful Jiangnan. This power plant did not exist before the war. There is no need to boast about the achievements of the Japanese. What the Japanese did in China was nothing but a cruel exploitation of the universal strength of the people to accumulate capital for military industry. Needless to say, it is not the achievements of the Japanese that can be boasted, but the things forged from the cream and blood of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>I looked at the old power plant built before the war. The electricians were repairing the turbine. The water rust in the iron sheets almost blocked the impeller with a one-inch gap. The Japanese only knew how to use the machines as much as possible without checking and repairing them, reflecting their psychological lack of future and the secret of brutally using material resources. In fact, this old motor should also be discarded, but it is not easy to develop the industrialization of our China universally for a while, so this old power plant still has to be repaired for power supply. Engineer Zhang Youxian told me that in addition to the power that this power plant can generate 1,600 kilowatts, the old Datong Power Plant can also generate 1,000 kilowatts, and the Huainan Mine's abandoned 345 kilowatts of power generation and the transfer of the Gaoping Coal Mine are still very grateful to others. Only the people in the handicraft mines know the effectiveness of the machinery and equipment under emergency needs, and those who are isolated from these things know where to look for the thirst of the ship fully loaded with sails for the wind.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Coal Mine Shaft</h3>
<p>The Huainan Coal Mine currently has three locations: the East Mine, the West Mine, and the Branch Mine. The East Mine is the location of the former Huainan Coal Mine Company's mines, the West Mine is the location of the former Datong Coal Mine Company's mines, and the Branch Mine is located near the West Mine. A person from the mine area described the coal seam in the mine area as being like a crucian carp. The old Huainan Mine (East Mine) in Jiulonggang is the head of the fish, the old Datong Company Mine (that is, today's West Mine) is the back of the fish, and the tail of the fish is the Dongshan Mine that is now closed.</p>
<p>Except for the closed Dongshan Mine, which I did not visit, I followed Engineer Zhang Youxian to visit the East Mine, the West Mine, and the West Branch Mine. Although I had seen the Anyuan Coal Mine in Pingxiang County, Jiangxi Province, and the Huagushan Coal Mine in Xinyu County earlier, I was still as terrified as a student entering school who was reading "The Primer of Classic," and I was too embarrassed to ask questions in front of this old mining master.</p>
<p>At the No. 2 shaft of the West Mine, I stared at the steel cables flowing up and down. The No. 2 shaft is 180 meters deep. One steel cable drops an empty coal car, and the other lifts a coal car full of coal. The time taken is 30 seconds. Working non-stop all day can hoist out 2,884 coal cars. Each military coal weighs 0.53 tons, totaling 1,500 tons of coal. This is the maximum limit for coal output at the No. 2 shaft. Due to the complexity of the work underground, although three shifts of workers go down the shaft to engage in coal mining, the amount of coal hoisted out of the shaft in one shift is between 400 and 600 cars. The total daily output of this shaft is 700 tons. After the coal car is hoisted out of this shaft, the coal loading car is immediately pushed out of the hoist basket, and an empty car is immediately pushed into the hoist basket to fill the empty space and dropped into the shaft to load coal. The coal car pushed out of the hoist basket is pushed by two workers on a small track, sliding to a flip cage 50 feet away. The turning force of the flip cage turns the coal car over and drops the coal onto the conveyor belt in the stacking room downstairs. The conveyor belt is made of wide leather and runs non-stop. The coal is sent to the separation cage through the conveyor belt to separate the coal lumps and coal fines. When the coal lumps are being transported, there are also workers sitting next to them all day to pick out the rotten wood blocks and stones in them, and then reach a large storage area, which is injected into the coal loading train carriages through a funnel and transported to the places where coal is needed.</p>
<p>Naturally, I regret that I have not been able to go down the mine to see the coal mining labor at the bottom of the pit. Just being next to the shaft, with coal fines flying in the sunlight, makes breathing heavy. Doing a shift of hard work underground will almost leave a lot of coal particles in the lungs. Therefore, the physical pain of the miners can be said to be the most severe type of human labor. In the Huagushan mine in Xinyu, I imitated the labor of the miners, carrying a basket rope basket filled with 30 pounds of coal on my shoulders and neck, climbing from the three-foot-high tunnel at the coal mining site to the elevator next to the coal hoisting machine. That basket of coal was dragged along by me, a beast-like crawler. The tunnel was dark, and a firefly-like mine lamp on my neck illuminated the tunnel. There were no demonic images in Dante's Purgatory. The air in the pit was like a narrow cave filled with a smoking coal stove. Occasionally, I would encounter another beast pulling coal crawling head-on. The naked skeleton covered with a layer of skin added to your feeling of being in hell. This is the painful labor that provides light and warmth for others. I have not been down to any mine in Huainan, but I know that these miners will not be much more comfortable than the people in the Huagushan mine in Xinyu. Of course, the engineers and assistants in the Huainan mine are also suffering from the pain of being corroded by the hard work under the strata, just like the officers who lead the troops are suffering from the hardships of the battlefield. The engineer Zhang Youxian, who accompanied me, used to go down the shaft and come up again to rescue the accumulated water in the shaft or the fire. Therefore, he often used a razor blade to cut open his riding boots when he came up. Because the immersion in water had long swollen the legs of this underground worker so that he could not pull down the leather tube of his riding boots that was tightly embedded in the flesh, and he had to cut it open to remove it. At present, because the power supply is uninterrupted, the accumulated water in the shaft can be extracted in time without any problems, so there have been no incidents of drowning. There have also been no incidents of fire or gas explosions in the shaft that have burned people. However, there are often people who are suffocated by the strong gas. On November 11, more than 20 workers were intoxicated by gas in the shaft. They were carried out and rescued without dying. Immediately, a 600-meter iron pipe of a coal stove chimney used for office heating was moved to this tunnel full of gas to send in fresh air and discharge the gas.</p>
<p>In a mine lamp room, I saw that the organization of this mine was a bit like a military camp. Every mine worker had to wear a small mine lamp attached to his hat in places where the electricity could not reach. This mine lamp was powered by a dry battery. This lamp room had a total of 1,600 mine lamps, which were arranged very neatly and continuously charged to supply the next shift of workers to pick up before going down the shaft.</p>
<p>The Huainan Coal Mine is a fairly mechanized industrial system due to the use of equipment and electricity to assist. However, because its coal system strata are steep slopes that are straight down at 80 degrees or more, the mine shafts are straight down and cannot be like the Pingxiang Coal Mine, which has flat tunnels. Therefore, underground coal mining sites and shaft traffic cannot use electric trams like the Pingxiang Coal Mine. Therefore, in terms of the total production cost, although the current Huainan coal production has advanced from 20 workers per ton (the productivity during the Japanese occupation) to today's five people producing one ton of coal (the output of the No. 3 shaft), it is still far from the level of one person producing one ton of coal in the Huainan Datong era before the war (the current working level of American miners is 40 tons per day per person. American coal production is so abundant, and the number of miners is only 400,000, of course, the high degree of mechanization of American mines is the main reason.)</p>

<h3>The Progress of China's Meteorological Undertakings</h3>
<p>— Lu Wenfu</p>
<p>Meteorology is a branch of applied science, and meteorological undertakings are important cornerstones for national defense and the construction of people's livelihoods. Before the Republic of China, China's meteorological undertakings were entirely in the hands of foreigners, who overstepped their bounds, which is shameful to say. The earliest establishment of an observatory was actually the Shanghai Xujiahui Observatory, established by Jesuit missionaries (1873), while the Hong Kong and Qingdao observatories were founded during the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the declining Qing Dynasty. These were managed by the British and German governments. After the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese widely established meteorological stations in southern Manchuria and the Yangtze River basin, while the Russians did so in Outer Mongolia and northern Manchuria. In remote areas, such as Yunnan and Tibet, the French and British also had meteorological facilities. Even the customs meteorological stations along the Yangtze River and the coast were established on the recommendation of the British man, Hart. It can be seen from this that officials and people at that time disregarded science and technology.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Education of the former Beijing government established the Central Observatory. In the second year of the Republic, a meteorological section was established, marking the beginning of China's self-run meteorological undertakings. Initially, observations were limited to Beijing, but later, branch meteorological stations were added in Kulun, Zhangbei, Kaifeng, and Xi'an. However, due to financial constraints, the branch stations were successively shut down by the 13th year of the Republic of China, and the Central Observatory itself was also on its last breath. At that time, the work of the observatory and its branches was limited to surface observations. Although weather forecasting had attempted to draw weather maps, it was difficult to achieve accuracy due to the small number of stations, and it never escaped the experimental stage.</p>
<p>In the 16th year of the Republic of China, the Northern Expedition was completed, and the National Government established its capital in Nanjing. The Meteorological Research Institute was established, directly under the Academia Sinica. Under the leadership of the Institute's director, Zhu Kezhen, China's meteorological undertakings began to make substantial progress. In addition to establishing its own meteorological stations in Jiuquan, Guiyang, Shanghai, Ningxia, Baotou, Lhasa, Beijing, Zhengzhou, Wuchang, Xi'an, Taishan, and Mount Emei, the Institute also provided instruments, trained personnel, and assisted various parties in establishing meteorological stations. At the same time, provinces, cities, and institutions involved in aviation, water conservancy, and education also gradually paid attention to this and decided to establish meteorological observatories and meteorological stations to meet their own needs. By the 25th year of the Republic of China, the number of meteorological stations across the country had reached more than 300. Technically, they all accepted the guidance of the Meteorological Research Institute. The scope of observation was not limited to the surface but extended to high altitudes. Wind-measuring balloons were launched daily in Beijing, Nanjing, Xi'an, Qingdao, Shanghai, Hankou, Xiamen, Hong Kong, Chongqing, Hangzhou, and other places. In Beijing, Nanjing, and Hong Kong, high-altitude meteorological observations were also conducted regularly using kites, airplanes, and sounding balloons. As surface and high-altitude observations became increasingly complete and the number of researchers increased daily, the effectiveness of weather forecasting greatly improved, and the true picture of the climate in various places gradually became clear. This was of great benefit to the improvement of aviation and navigation safety and the design of agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy, and it was not only for academic research.</p>
<p>Since the invasion of the Japanese pirates and the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the southeast half of the country has been lost, and the hard work of the past has been reduced to ashes. The Meteorological Research Institute moved to Sichuan. Due to insufficient funds, it could not promote meteorological undertakings. However, due to the needs of the times, the Executive Yuan established the Central Meteorological Bureau in the 30th year of the Republic of China. Since then, meteorological undertakings have been in the hands of a dedicated agency. Under the leadership of the Bureau, the meteorological observation networks in the southwest and northwest were completed, and the Meteorological Research Institute was able to devote all its efforts to theoretical research. However, at that time, maritime transport was not open, and equipment was inevitably simple and crude, and it was difficult to be satisfactory. After the victory, the Central Meteorological Bureau officials returned to the capital and immediately worked hard to take over the meteorological stations of the enemy and puppets and plan the revival of meteorological undertakings. They also drafted a five-year meteorological plan in order to complete it year by year. The main points of the plan are three: (1) To build a national meteorological observation network, setting up 32 first-class meteorological observatories, 119 second-class meteorological observatories, and 355 third-class meteorological observatories, divided into 11 districts. All meteorological stations are equipped with radio equipment. In addition to regularly observing surface and high-altitude meteorology, the district central meteorological observatories also collect records from various stations daily and issue weather reports. (2) To cultivate meteorological talents and establish a meteorological specialized school. (3) To replenish instrument equipment and establish an instrument factory to manufacture various meteorological instruments. At present, the Bureau directly manages meteorological observatories and stations, including seven first-class meteorological observatories or meteorological stations in Nanjing, Shanghai, Beijing, Wuhan, Dinghai, Suzhou, and Mount Wuyi; forty second-class meteorological observatories in Meitan, Chongqing, Kangding, Changsha, Yuanling, Chaling, Changde, Dali, Nanzheng, Yangquan, Taiyuan, Tanggu, Zhongning, Tianjin, Nanning, Shibei, Songpan, Guangyuan, Yulin, Xichang, Ya'an, Qilian Mountain, Nanchong, Pengshui, Youyang, Leibo, Daxian, Fengjie, Lijiang, Yuxi, Zhenyuan, Xingren, Weining, Tongren, Anshun, Luodian, Shangxian, Mount Hua, Sanjiang, Fulin, etc.; and four third-class meteorological observatories in Xining, Dulan, Anxi, and Lhasa, totaling 51 stations. All conduct surface observations at regular intervals, 24 times a day for first-class stations, 6 to 8 times for second-class stations, and 3 times for third-class stations. In addition, there are 19 first-class meteorological observatories, 54 second-class meteorological observatories, and 21 third-class meteorological observatories in various provinces and cities. In the past, although the technical aspects were all guided by the Central Meteorological Bureau, due to the inconsistency of systems and repeated overlapping, the equipment varied in quality. There is now a proposal to have the Bureau take over and manage them in a unified manner. However, when the Bureau itself was established, it was constrained by the wartime environment, its organization was small, and its budget was limited. If it wants to develop, it still needs the attention and improvement of the government. The business of the Central Meteorological Bureau can be roughly divided into three categories: (1) Managing meteorological observatories and stations at all levels across the country. (2) Collecting and organizing meteorological records across the country. (3) Issuing weather reports, and the latter is the most concerning to the general public. At present, the Nanjing Bureau and its affiliated Shanghai and Beijing meteorological observatories collect meteorological telegrams from home and abroad in East Asia every day at regular intervals, draw weather maps and high-altitude charts, and formulate weather forecasts and various warnings based on them, which are submitted to newspapers and news agencies for publication, and broadcast by radio stations, coastal radio stations, and its own XQG5 (1/2KW, 8500KC.) radio station once a day for aviation, sea, and coastal fishermen to listen to and use.</p>
<p>The study of meteorology depends on the collection of records from various places. In the fourth year of the Republic of China, the Central Observatory published a series of observation publications, which were discontinued in the tenth year of the Republic of China. After that, the Meteorological Research Institute also published meteorological yearbooks, monthly journals, and high-altitude observation reports. The results of observations from all over the country were widely collected and carefully selected. The Institute also devoted itself to the整理 of historical records. In the 25th year of the Republic of China, a special publication on rainfall in China was compiled and printed, which recorded 353 stations up to the 22nd year of the Republic of China, and was accompanied by maps of annual and monthly rainfall distribution, totaling more than 500 pages, which was magnificent. After the War of Resistance, the "Temperature of China" was also printed, and its content and compilation were the same as the previous book. With the arrival of victory, the Institute also published "Climate Data of China," in three volumes, including the average and extreme values of rainfall, temperature, humidity, cloud cover, etc. before the 30th year of the Republic of China in various places. The content is rich and sufficient for reference. After the establishment of the Central Meteorological Bureau, it also broadly collected records from various places over the years, publishing ten-day periodicals every ten days and annual reports every year. Recently, there has also been a large-scale production of "Atlas of Chinese Climate." The atlas contains 96 distribution maps of air pressure, wind direction, temperature, rainfall, humidity, cloud cover, sunshine, fog, haze, and frost days. The maps are carefully drawn and are essential reference books for those engaged in construction plans such as farmland water conservancy.</p>
<p>The most important domestic purely meteorological publications are the Collected Papers of the Meteorological Research Institute, the Journal of the Chinese Meteorological Society, and the Meteorological Series of the Central Meteorological Bureau. In addition, the geography departments or aviation research institutes of various universities also publish special or collected publications from time to time. The Collected Papers of the Meteorological Research Institute is an international publication, mostly written in English, and has now been published to Volume 13, Number 3. The Journal of Meteorology, formerly known as the Meteorological Magazine, emphasizes both introductions and monographs. All papers are accompanied by English abstracts. Before Volume 10, the publication was an annual publication. Volumes 11 to 13 were monthly publications. After Volume 14, due to printing difficulties, it was changed back to an annual publication, and it has now been published to Volume 18. The Central Meteorological Bureau Series was published in the 34th year of the Republic of China and is irregular. Generally, one volume is published per year, and each volume has four issues. The third issue of the second volume has recently been published. The research on Chinese meteorology, judging from the published papers, is mostly concentrated on the study of weather and climate issues, and there are fewer theoretical aspects. This is probably due to practical needs. In recent years, as meteorological undertakings have developed and meteorological education has greatly improved, the geography departments of various university science colleges are mostly attached to meteorological groups, and the Central University and Tsinghua University have even established meteorological departments, but not many people apply for the exam, and only a few graduates graduate each year, which is far from meeting the needs. It is hoped that domestic youth will be determined to pursue science and devote themselves to this field, so that this undertaking related to national defense and the construction of people's livelihoods can develop rapidly and lay the foundation for the country's lasting prosperity.</p>
<h3>Speaking of Fengqiu with Tears (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Kaifeng, 19th Dispatch from Aviation News, Our Reporter in Bian, Wang Shoumei</p>
<p>Director Chen said: "In his mind, besides the nation, the people, and military plans, there are also the two words 'self-discipline'. In spirit and in material terms, these two words really dominate his thoughts and actions. Therefore, he has never competed with others for fame or fortune, and has never had any misunderstandings with superiors or subordinates. Whether his superiors treat him well or poorly, whether he is rewarded or punished, he accepts it sincerely, obeys absolutely, and will never be dissatisfied or doubt his superiors. Even when he heard the New China Daily editorial of the Communist Party of China speaking out for him, he just smiled it off. He is the same to friendly forces and subordinates. Whether it is slander or misunderstanding, he uses practical actions to answer other people's misunderstandings. His private life is very simple. I know that this winter, because military uniforms were too expensive, he dismantled an old overcoat and remade it into the set of military uniforms he is wearing now. I don't know anything else." Director Chen said while thinking, as if with a bit of shyness.</p>
<p>"Thank you. My interview work with General Sun is over." I thanked him with a smile.</p>
<p>"That won't do. You are doing work unintentionally, and I can't take responsibility!" he said with a smile.</p>
<p>Morning Assembly in the Wind and Snow</p>
<p>On the morning of the 17th, we reporters, who were used to living an upside-down life, exceptionally got up at six o'clock in order to participate in the morning assembly. The weather is unpredictable. Yesterday it was sunny and beautiful, but today it was windy and snowy. Director Chen braved the wind and snow to invite us to the assembly hall. In the blowing wind and snow, we walked to the assembly hall (a vast open space). A thunderous burst of applause sent us to the front of the flagpole. I looked back and saw a dark mass. To the north were the troops, in the middle were civil servants and students, to the south were the people, and behind were the artillerymen about to depart. On the platform stood a chairman, who was the principal of the central school. (The morning assembly—raising the flag—was a joint event held at 7:00 every morning after the Fifth Pacification Zone arrived in Fengqiu, mobilizing people from all walks of life in Fengqiu, including the party, government, military, schools, and the public. The chairman was rotated among the heads of the various provinces.) After the majestic national anthem was sung, everyone saluted, and the bright and beautiful national flag rose into the snowy sky amid the melodious military music.</p>
<p>The invigorating exercises of thousands of people began. This was a vigorous activity that we had never seen in Kaifeng.</p>
<p>"Eliminate bandits!" "Eliminate corruption!" "Develop the economy!" "Pay attention to education!" "Support righteousness!" "Build a new Fengqiu!" Forty minutes later, these slogans ended the morning assembly.</p>
<p>There were photos to be taken here and photos to be taken there. We, who choose the lens every day, have become the lenses of others.</p>
<p>Listening to Military Affairs</p>
<p>At nine o'clock, we arrived at the headquarters of the Fifth Pacification Zone. Commander Sun and Deputy Commander Dong sent us into the reception room. The walls were covered with military maps, with red circles, blue circles, arrows, and small flags, which looked quite fresh and eye-catching. After the host and guests were seated, the taciturn Commander Sun spoke: "If you gentlemen want to understand the current situation in our Pacification Zone, let our Chief of Staff Hu report to you." Then Chief of Staff Hu stood up. He first gave a comprehensive report on the battles that the Fifth Pacification Zone had gone through from Henan to eastern Henan and last month in the Fengqiu, Huaxian, Dongming, Puyang, and Puxian areas. Then he said sadly: "Our headquarters has been fighting bloody battles with the enemy for the past eight or nine years, and then resisting the Communist army in self-defense. Now, we still have to endure the pain of defending against the Communist army for the sake of national unity. All officers and soldiers are very sad. I am absolutely obedient to the Central Government's ceasefire order and will not move. However, the Communist army is always burning with the flames of war and wants to make a comeback at any time. If you look at the current situation, you will know their ambition." As he spoke, he took a long bamboo pole like a teaching whip and walked to the front of the map with a section chief from the Second Department. He began lecturing like a geography teacher: "On the Communist army's side in our Pacification Zone is the Fourth Military District of Liu Bocheng's Jilu-Yu Border Region. In this area, the Communist army has 25 local regiments, stationed in the area of ​​Batouji in Dongming and the area of ​​Baliying in Huaxian. In addition, its main force has seven columns, stationed in the Yanggu and Chaocheng areas, constantly attacking our national army..." As he spoke, he pointed to the map with that slender bamboo pole.</p>
<p>Chief of Staff Hu stood up again and supplemented: "The Communist army will not forget this land. They always want to paint this land red again, but this dream will never be realized because of the terror of the vast number of farmers in the war. In January this year, the Communist army kidnapped more than 90 of their women. They will never forget this bloody debt of shame. Their urgent hope is to live in stability, to seek to restore their former peace and comfort in life, and to seek future progress, and are unwilling to entrust their destiny to the unreachable illusion with the current bloody struggle. Based on this awareness, they believe that it is necessary to strictly organize training in order to cooperate with the national army to ensure the safety of their families. They have suffered enough, but in extreme hardship, they need to organize an armed self-defense force. In response to the needs, the Political Department of our headquarters has divided the eight townships in the county into eight self-defense brigades, 120 self-defense squadrons, and 9,022 self-defense strong men. The cadres at all levels are served by retired military officers. A political instructor is assigned to each township to work with the military training officers sent by the county self-defense corps to conduct district training for two or three hours every day during their spare time. Having been trained for more than two hours, their knowledge and skills in armed protection of their hometown and maintaining local security have been preliminarily established. They can all be competent as "the government's armed force", "the people's protection", and "the national army's helper". We hope that the people on this land will live and work in peace like this, and we hope that you gentlemen will give more guidance so that we can follow!"</p>
<p>Sounding Cries</p>
<p>Commander Sun's banquet lasted for more than an hour. Without delaying, we went to the county government to attend a symposium with local representatives. I took the opportunity to go to the detention center alone to take a look. This detention center was pitifully small, with only five or six rooms (even the county government was pitifully small. It is said that the original county government was torn down by the Japanese and the Communist army, and the current county government was originally a private house.). Divided into two rooms, there were more than 70 prisoners detained, mostly murderers and stray troops. Those prisoners who had rarely been judged and were detained shouted when they saw reporters enter: "Commissioner, please be merciful and give us a judgment quickly!" I couldn't answer them, so I backed out. When I arrived at the conference room, the symposium had already been going on for half a day. County Magistrate Liu had already finished his report, and Provincial Councilor Wang Faping was crying out in pain with tears in his eyes. He said: "Fengqiu was originally a fifth-class county with congenital deficiencies. After more than eight years of devastation and several destructions by the Communist army, the people are impoverished and their resources are exhausted. The local people's strength cannot support the current large army gathering and the huge supply needs. In order to survive, the people need the army to protect them. With the army to protect them, they are unable to survive. They are willing to give everything they have to supply the difficult army, but they have nothing. The burden of various apportionments of 305,275,048 yuan and 1,565,000 catties of grain, as well as 912 sets of cotton clothes and 334 sets of cotton coats, has fallen on the shoulders of the only 130,000 people who remain out of the original population of more than 150,000. The total amount of losses due to various natural and man-made disasters is 16,878,222.025 yuan. This heavy burden figure, placed on the shoulders of a dying patient, is unbearable for them, but most of them are still gritting their teeth and enduring it in the position of military-civilian cooperation and sympathy for the army. They cannot afford to pay for firewood and have already demolished their own houses to use as firewood to send to the army, because the troops in the Fifth Pacification Zone are all very good now. Although the people are suffering, they cannot bear to let the army have no firewood to burn. Some places really can't bear it anymore, so they painfully "hand in their license plates" (hand in their doorplates, and they flee to other places). When they hand in too many, it forms a "collapsed guarantee" (the guarantee becomes empty, just like this guarantee has fallen into a probe). Therefore, you will not see a smiling face in Fengqiu, and you will not hear a singing "road show". Everyone is waiting for relief in the tragic cold, waiting to reduce the burden. Liu, the speaker, and the president of the Chamber of Commerce both had tearful cries that made the reporter unbearable to recall and unwilling to repeat! Again, at 2:00 in the afternoon, we carried the light and blood and tears here, said goodbye to Fengqiu, and returned to Kaifeng.</p>

<h3>Agricultural Improvement Undertakings of the Jiangsu Provincial Government</h3>
<p>— Ji Junmian</p>
<p>A Historical Retrospect</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province has a long history of agricultural improvement. In the early years of the Republic of China, the Second Cotton Crop Experiment Station of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce was established, and the provincial forestry farm, mulberry farm, wheat crop experiment station, and miscellaneous grain experiment station were established one after another to lead the improvement of agriculture in Jiangsu Province. Unfortunately, due to the warlords' manipulation of power, the failure of politics to get on the right track, and the impact of financial constraints, it failed to develop. Although scholars and experts such as Zou Bingwen and the late Mr. Zhang Qian advocated it, it was never able to develop.</p>
<p>After the Northern Expedition, the Jiangsu Provincial Government established a Department of Agriculture and Mining, with Director He Yushu, who was very enthusiastic about handling affairs, and hired experts to preside over it, such as cotton expert Sun Yushu and horticulture expert Lu Feishuchen, who had devoted their efforts to the agricultural construction of Jiangsu Province and determined the business of each farm and station and carefully planned its funding.</p>
<p>The provincial fisheries experiment station was also established at this time, and there were fishing boats to demonstrate fishing.</p>
<p>The cultivation of land has always been important in Jiangsu Province, but it has not been paid attention to by the agricultural administrative authorities in the past. After the establishment of the Department of Agriculture and Mining, the Cultivation Undertakings Committee was established, and experts and representatives of land reclamation groups were invited to jointly organize it to discuss land reclamation matters. This was the beginning of the provincial administrative organs paying attention to land reclamation undertakings.</p>
<p>On the promotion side, there was a promotion committee to plan the promotion of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fisheries, sericulture throughout the province.</p>
<p>Agricultural improvement and promotion, the county-level agencies were originally extremely important, but they have always been ignored. After the completion of the Northern Expedition, the county agricultural farms in Jiangsu Province were universally established, and in the counties with the benefits of fish and salt in the coastal area, fisheries guidance institutes were also established. Funding is the mother of undertakings, and the provincial government also stipulated that an agricultural improvement donation should be levied as funding for county agricultural improvement. There are two other characteristics of this period. One is that the responsible host of the county agricultural farm must pass the examination of the department before he can be appointed, and he can not be easily changed to be able to appoint true talents to make the workers feel at ease. The other is that the administration belongs to the county, and the use of funds is absolutely subject to the supervision of the county, and the implementation of the undertaking is directly subject to the guidance of the county, and only reported to the county for record. The foundation is gradually solid, quite vibrant. The business of the county farm is tailored to local conditions, and divided into the first main business, the second main business, and the sideline business. Promotion is the main thing, and the preservation and breeding of species are secondary. This period can be regarded as the golden age of agricultural improvement in Jiangsu Province being most on the right track.</p>
<p>Department of Construction Improvement of Animal Husbandry and Cotton Seeds</p>
<p>The effectiveness of agricultural improvement cannot be waited for immediately. It must be meticulous and move forward step by step. In the era of the Department of Agriculture and Mining of Jiangsu Province, only the foundation was fixed and the preliminary plan was completed. If given time to advance in an orderly manner, there will be achievements. Unfortunately, not long after, the provincial government partially reorganized, and the Department of Agriculture and Mining was merged into the Department of Construction. The provincial farms were once suspended, and the county farms were changed to agricultural extension centers. A few counties still retained the fisheries department, but it was only a change in name, and the actual situation was empty, not as orderly as in the past. Moreover, there was no seal or bell mark, and the administration could not be promoted at all. It was not like an organ or a group. The agricultural improvement donation was also merged into the construction treasury and became a part of the county's construction funds. It could not be independent, and it was inevitable that there would be difficulties in application. Although Changju hoped very much, it was ultimately because the organization was unsound and lacked a complete plan, it only became the end of a powerful crossbow, and it could hardly maintain the glory of the previous period.</p>
<p>However, during this period, animal husbandry was more advanced than in the previous period. The famous pig and sheep producing areas in Jiangsu Province were selected, and the pig and sheep breeding preservation and animal husbandry experimental areas were jointly established with the Central Breeding Farm to improve pig and sheep breeds. The history is relatively shallow, but it has made many contributions to the prevention and control of animal diseases, and those who raise pigs and sheep have benefited greatly from it. This is one of the characteristics of this period. The fisheries departments of various counties (it seems that there is no longer the name of fisheries guidance institute, only attached to the agricultural extension center) have successively tried to start with practical demonstrations, building ships and buying nets, in order to carry out fishing and hope to be self-sufficient, not relying on the support of public funds. This is the second characteristic of this period. In terms of cotton industry, in addition to the original provincial cotton farm, there was also the establishment of the Jiangsu Provincial Cotton Production Improvement Office. The former paid attention to experiments, and the latter paid attention to promotion, division of labor and cooperation, and the scope was quite broad. The Central Cotton Production Improvement Institute also cooperated with it, and the effectiveness of the undertaking was still demonstrated. This is the third characteristic of this period.</p>
<p>After the Victory: The People are Looking Forward To</p>
<p>When the Japanese invaders invaded the country, the government moved west, and all agricultural, fishery, and animal husbandry institutions in the province were completely suspended or assisted in matters related to the War of Resistance. Today, one year after the victory, the agricultural institutions in the province have not yet fully returned to their original positions. Although some provincial farms have been formally restored, the funding is so small that the undertaking cannot be launched, making the hosts disheartened and the expectations disappointed. The animal husbandry part is still in the custody period. As for the county-level agencies, there is no need to talk about undertakings. They either work in the county government, or they are established but lack funding and have nothing to do, so they are abolished.</p>
<p>In the eight years since the fall, the countryside has been exploited by the enemy and puppets. It is extremely tragic and painful. Looking at it today, one year after the victory, it is still full of holes and scars. Unless relief and restoration are carried out as soon as possible, it will not be enough to relieve the farmers' difficulties. However, how to get on the right path of relieving difficulties is difficult to achieve without the joint efforts of those responsible for administration and agriculture. - The characteristic systems and undertakings of the past are all the teachers of today, and more importantly, it is to hit the current malpractices and not to engage in empty talk in order to be practical.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Unemployment</h3>
<p>— Hao</p>
<p>There are many reasons for unemployment. Scholars have studied and divided them into five categories: accidental, individual, social, political, and economic.</p>
<p>(1) The so-called accidental causes are of two types: natural disasters and man-made disasters. (1) Natural disasters include earthquakes, floods, fires, droughts, and hurricanes. (2) Man-made disasters include international wars and domestic wars.</p>
<p>(2) The so-called individual causes include deficiencies in intelligence, physical strength, and morality, as well as diseases, old age, and special changes in duties, all of which can lead to unemployment for laborers.</p>
<p>(3) The so-called social causes are those where the blame for unemployment is attributed to society. In short, there are approximately six aspects: unequal distribution of wealth, monopolization of land, overpopulation, lack of organization, lack of training, and lack of job placement services. Unequal distribution of wealth weakens the purchasing power of ordinary people, causing capital to stagnate and factories to close down. Monopolization of land allows landlords to manipulate arbitrarily, engaging in unproductive speculation and competition, leaving farmers with no land to cultivate. Moreover, lack of organization leads to misunderstandings between laborers and employers, preventing concrete reconciliation, and workers are unable to take mutual assistance measures. Furthermore, lack of training deprives laborers of opportunities to learn vocational skills, resulting in a lack of precise skills. Even if they勉强engage in work, they inevitably waste materials, produce substandard products, and have limited sales, causing factories to shrink. As a result, laborers are dismissed by employers.</p>
<p>(4) The so-called political causes include the lack of legal protection for laborers and the heavy burden of excessive taxes on industry and commerce.</p>
<p>(5) The so-called economic causes are more complex. Because laborers are originally one of the factors of economic production. Now, list the twelve items as follows: (A) Changes in the economic cycle cause industry and commerce to decline from prosperity, resulting in labor unemployment. (B) The evolution and changes of industry cause old-fashioned workers to become unemployed due to their inability to adapt to new and different machinery. (C) Seasonal industrial laborers become unemployed due to the periodic nature of their work. (D) Industry and commerce lack accurate information, resulting in supply and demand imbalances, business failures, and workers being unemployed. (E) Abuse of the credit system and easy borrowing lead to widespread imitation of even slight profits, resulting in overproduction and labor unemployment. (F) Excessive working hours and unsuitable work cause workers to be overworked, reduce wages, result in poor production, damage business, and cause labor unemployment. (G) Excessive competition among businesses leads to mutual infighting, ultimately resulting in overproduction or collapse, creating unemployment. (H) Children's early employment leads to physical damage, making them unable to work in old age, leading to unemployment. At the same time, healthy adults are crowded out by child labor, leading to unemployment. (J) Lack of raw materials prevents factories from manufacturing, leading to laborers being unable to find work. (I) Currency chaos causes prices to easily rise, and the industrial sector closes factories due to overproduction, causing workers to become unemployed. (K) Excessive speculation causes financial tightening in the market and credit instability, leading to industrial and commercial decline and worker unemployment. (L) The rise of class struggle makes labor and capital prone to disputes or union strikes to pressure factories, or factories close down and dismiss workers, causing workers to have another chance of unemployment.</p>
<h3>Building the Jin'ou Railway</h3>
<p>— Nairen</p>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, which connects the most important trunk lines in Southeast and Southwest China, is currently under active construction. The transportation between the Southeast and Southwest regions is expected to be smooth soon.</p>
<p>This reminds us of a railway line that seems to need to be built immediately, namely the Jin'ou Railway proposed by the Jinhua Chamber of Commerce. The construction of this line can be said to have added an important artery to the Southeast region and also be said to have given the most powerful assistance to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Now that Taiwan has been restored to our national territory, we cannot ignore the importance of building this railway line, both in terms of national defense and economy.</p>
<p>Between Jinhua and Oujiang, the original highway was completely demolished during the war. Although part of it has been repaired after the victory, most of it has not been repaired. As for the Oujiang River, it is only navigable by some civilian ships, which is difficult to bear the heavy responsibility in the future.</p>
<p>Starting from Yongjia, passing through Qingtian and Lishui, and reaching Jinhua, it is connected to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. The section from Yongjia to Lishui follows the Oujiang River, and the route seems to have no problems. However, for the section from Lishui to Jinhua, should it pass through Xuanping County, pass through Wuyi to reach Jinhua, or pass through Jinyun and Yongkang to reach Jinhua, it seems that there is still a need for discussion. Because the former has relatively flat terrain, while the original highway passes through Jinyun and Yongkang. As for Yongjia, it can even be extended to Ruian and Pingyang, and even to Fuzhou and Xiamen.</p>
<p>The wealthy Wenzhou was opened as a commercial port in the second year of Guangxu. The Prime Minister designated it as a third-class fishing port in the industrial plan. The industry and commerce are prosperous, the agricultural products are abundant, and the fishery is particularly developed. Other things like Pingyang's alum, Qingtian's 礦minerals, and Wuyi's 戴dai stone are all closely related to agriculture and national defense industries, and all need the construction of this railway to help their development and internal transportation.</p>
<p>Wenzhou is very close to Taiwan, and it can be reached by boat in less than a day. Building the Jin'ou Railway is the best way to connect Taiwan with the mainland, so as to control Taiwan Island and consolidate national defense. At the same time, Taiwanese rice, Taiwanese sugar, camphor, petroleum, etc. can also be transshipped from Wenzhou to Jinhua and sold in various places in the mainland, so that this "Formosa" (meaning beautiful island) can be integrated with the mainland economically, politically and culturally, and will no longer be a special administrative region.</p>

<h3>Improving the Textile Industry</h3>
<p>— A Lecture by Rong Dexin, Recorded by You Maoquan</p>
<p>Mr. Rong Dexin, Chief Engineer of Shenxin No. 25 Textile Factory, gave a speech at the Gengchen Alumni Association of the Chinese Textile Society after returning from the United States. The main points are excerpted below. Today, I am very happy to be warmly received by all of you. Now I will talk to you casually.</p>
<p>Obtaining specialized knowledge from school and then going to the factory to do it in practice, you must go through all kinds of difficulties to get the results. This is valuable experience. Therefore, as long as everyone can earnestly devote themselves to hard work, they can get sufficient experience.</p>
<p>Human affairs are complicated and intricate, so dealing with people is much more difficult than dealing with technology. Especially in my country's textile factories, human affairs are even more complicated. Under the same organization, many, many factions will be created, so dealing with people is even more difficult. When we deal with people, we must first determine a handling policy based on the actual situation in all aspects. At the same time, in any environment, the most important thing is to first understand the evolution of the entire environment; second, adapt to the trend of the entire environment. In this situation, carefully deal with the opportunity. After a considerable period of time, can you start the established steps of transforming the environment and implement the improvement plan.</p>
<p>When I was trained at the Central Personnel Training Institute, I respectfully listened to Chairman Chiang explaining that the government's war of resistance was three points military and seven points political. We should observe the international situation and determine the political path. With seven points of sound politics and three points of sound military, we can attack and win, and win every battle. Therefore, under the wise leadership of Chairman Chiang, our country followed the above-mentioned policy to achieve this unprecedented final victory.</p>
<p>Those of us who serve in the textile industry, especially in the current situation of my country's textile factories, should deal with human affairs seven points and technology three points. Although each of us recognizes the importance of industrial construction now, we must understand that construction should start from everyone's psychology and complete "psychological construction." At the same time, no matter how big or small things are, the disposal should have the spirit of "utmost sincerity" and "utmost impartiality." I hope everyone has a common spirit to promote the great future of my country's textile industry.</p>
<p>When I was in the United States, I went to a factory research laboratory to study. There were many experimental instruments that I had never seen in China. From this, I can understand that there is no end to learning and technology. In short, if you don't advance, you will retreat. You should catch up quickly and work hard at the forefront of technology. In addition to working hard in the factory, you should also seek advancement in academic aspects, cultivate your personality and body, and learn in the aspects of dealing with the world.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Discussion on Management</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Various Issues in Personnel Management: Labor Issues</p>
<p>Regarding labor issues, they vary depending on the goods being manufactured. Usually, the more exquisite the goods, the higher the wages paid. In the past, general manufacturers did not pay much attention to labor issues, so workers often changed their workplaces. As long as a factory could pay a higher price, they would go there to work. This situation is actually very inappropriate for manufacturers, because on the one hand, skilled workers, once they leave, will inevitably affect the work, and on the other hand, every factory has some commercial secrets, such as the style of the machines, the installation situation, and the production situation, as well as the work situation, should not be known to the same industry.</p>
<p>Therefore, modern personnel management should be able to achieve the following points:</p>
<p>1. Able to hire appropriate workers, 2. Able to make workers work with peace of mind, 3. Able to increase the service period of workers. Therefore, personnel management has also become a specialized subject. To make the enterprise organization develop, the work in the personnel management part must be sound.</p>
<p>Personnel Management Work and Production Work</p>
<p>There used to be a saying that "doing the purchasing work perfectly is equal to doing half of the sales work." This sentence does contain a great truth, because if the raw materials we use are the best and the price is very fair, then we can make cheap and beautiful goods, which will of course be much more convenient in terms of sales, that is, we can achieve twice the result with half the effort. In a manufacturing plant, the purchase of materials needs to be handled shrewdly and reasonably. The employment of labor is in principle equivalent to purchasing a batch of raw materials, because the wages of labor must also be included in the cost of goods, and labor issues are more important than raw materials, because when purchasing raw materials, just look at the samples and carefully check them, and there will be no problems. After employing labor, it is also necessary to supervise them from time to time so that they will not waste time, and to encourage them so that they will have better work performance, because if the workers waste time, it will reduce production efficiency and indirectly affect costs and reduce profits. Therefore, labor issues are closely related to production, and to make production work smoothly and achieve good results, labor issues are indeed worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Personnel Management and Management Section</p>
<p>Since personnel management is very important, the personnel management section cannot be taken care of by a low-level employee. The scope of personnel management is very wide, because in an enterprise organization, in addition to the general manager, manager, and factory director being hired or concurrently held by the board of directors, the rest of the employees need to be hired or employed. Hiring or employment is the first step of personnel management work. If it is presided over by a low-level employee, and the person hired is a higher-level employee than him, then in order to implement all the implementation of personnel management due to the relationship of position, it will be difficult.</p>
<p>Therefore, the person responsible for handling personnel management matters must be an important employee. Previously, we have proposed the method of organizing a personnel management committee, which can really be said to be from a reasonable ideal, because organizing a committee, all department heads can participate, this method can make the actual situation of various aspects can be used as a reference before deciding on a certain measure, and it can be known in advance whether there will be difficulties when implementing it in the future.</p>
<p>This method of personnel management committee can produce the following effects:</p>
<p>1. When formulating various rules and regulations, you can get opinions from many aspects and know in advance whether there will be difficulties when implementing them.</p>
<p>2. Each part of the enterprise organization can receive the same treatment, and there will never be any discrepancies with each other.</p>
<p>3. In the event of personnel problems, such as the demands raised by labor, they can be dealt with concretely.</p>
<p>4. Because it is a concrete organization, it makes all employees easily obey the consolidation rules set by the committee.</p>
<p>In the personnel management committee, there must of course be several clerks to handle daily affairs, such as statistics, records, various copying and distribution of affairs.</p>

<h3>Talking About Several Ways to Write a Play</h3>
<p>— Ding Bolu</p>
<p>"There is no fixed rule to follow when writing a play." This is a famous saying by Ibsen. As far as he himself is concerned, some of the works produced by him did not completely use a fixed method.</p>
<p>But if we try to summarize the experience of some playwrights, it is not difficult to see that although they do not admit that there is a certain way to write, they always stick to several ways.</p>
<p>One way is to first have a proposition (the author uses the ideas that have been nurtured in his life experience and observation to make a suggestion or proposal), and then select appropriate characters and appropriate situations to illustrate the author's thoughts. This method is a common one after the emergence of modern drama. Writers who unite social values and artistic insights often start writing with such steps. There are many people who have achieved success by completing their works in this way, and there are also many failures, because the people and things they arrange are often too logical, too conceptual, and too didactic... making the degree of complexity of the people and things in the play is not enough, the depth is not enough, and the convexity is not enough.</p>
<p>It is still worthwhile to take Ibsen as an example of this writing method. Although it was said above that he has used more than one method, he can also provide us with a good example in terms of this method.</p>
<p>After the age of fifty, Ibsen's daily life became a fixed set of habits. In two years, he conceived and wrote. Every second Tuesday in January, a new work was published. As soon as one was completed, he immediately planned the writing of the next one. He spent almost a whole year cultivating the proposition, characters, and plot he wanted to write; then he spent the second whole year constantly writing and constantly revising. Every day, at the same time, he walked into the usual coffee shop, sat in the usual seat, and flipped through the newspapers, peeking at the passing guests from the top of the newspapers. At home, he rarely spoke to anyone, with no exception to his wife and son; he was a lonely person. His family knew his temper well, and no one troubled him, nor did they ever ask what play he was planning or writing, because experience had already told them that they could read his new work only when the second Tuesday in January of the second year came.</p>
<p>He was a writer who cherished the original manuscript very much, and did not discard even the first draft like other writers. After his death, many original manuscripts were unexpectedly discovered. Those blank papers left traces of his thoughts in the writing process, leaving a great convenience for those who study Ibsen later.</p>
<p>When Ibsen was fifty years old, it was 1878, he stayed in Rome for a short time. One sunny afternoon, he received a letter, glanced at it and stuffed it into his pocket, and then went out for a walk. As he was walking on the street, a thought suddenly popped out. He immediately stopped and wrote down what he thought of on the back of the envelope. This envelope is still preserved to this day, and the words left on it allow us to peek into the secret of writing of a great writer.</p>
<p>The handwriting begins with "——October 19, 1878, Rome." Another line is like a small title —— "Tragic Data," followed by: "There are two moral laws, two consciousnesses: one is the man's, the other belongs to the woman. They do not know each other, and in real life, women's behavior is measured by men's rules, as if they were men rather than women." (——This is already a complete proposition.</p>
<p>A few days later, he wrote down: "The wife in the play encounters misfortune because she has no sense of right and wrong. Natural emotions and artificial authority confuse her."</p>
<p>"A woman does not exist in the present society, because they live in a male society, in which all the rules are made by men, and the judiciary that judges women's behavior stands entirely from the male point of view."</p>
<p>"She committed forgery, but she thought she was glorious, because she loved her husband deeply and had to save his life. However, the husband stood on the side of the law with worldly concepts and looked at this issue from a male perspective."</p>
<p>After reading these words left by Ibsen on the envelope, and thinking about all his works, those who are familiar with his works will immediately think: Isn't this the outline of "A Doll's House"? Yes, that famous play was developed from the proposition he got when he was walking.</p>
<p>Let's talk about another way —— starting from conceiving a character or a group of characters and then developing it into a play.</p>
<p>Hamilton said: "If I put some people together, if I pay attention to them for a long enough time, what they say and do will give me a wealth of writing material." This is a powerful revelation.</p>
<p>We still 不not search for examples from the documents left by Ibsen.</p>
<p>In his first memorandum when planning to write "Hedda Gabler", he wrote such short words: "Gray, cold as ice, beautiful as peach and plum." From those words, you can't see any meaningful proposition at all, and it is not a complete sentence. Then a phrase was added after this phrase: "Desire for great events in life or the joy of life." But still叫people can't see what the meaning is. Then, more complete words were added: "The man and woman finally won. He is mediocre in appearance, but he is a respectable, intelligent, and freedom-loving scientific researcher." At this point, a line of dialogue suddenly connected: "Hedda said —— I have no interest in anything, only boredom."</p>
<p>He used these fragmented materials to construct a　tall building.</p>
<p>William Archer probably disagreed with this writing method. He said: Even with "Hedda Gabler", he could not see that any proposition that the author wanted to propose could be found from the people in the play.</p>
<p>This is indeed a bit deliberately nitpicking; in any case, in this play, Ibsen did not forget the soul of a work —— the theme —— because he started from the characters. Think about it, isn't the misfortune of the heroine in the play —— Hedda's due to the social reasons seen in Ibsen's eyes? She is a woman of extremely good nature. If she changed to a better living environment,　she would become a shining gem. Unfortunately, she did not. On the contrary, she lived in a wrong world, a wrong country, a wrong city, and a wrong family, so she ruined others and herself. This play is another challenge book that Ibsen gave to society. It is unfair to say that "Hedda Gabler" has no theme.</p>
<p>In the early days of writing, many critics often said that Arthur Pinero's works had no obvious proposition, which made him very distressed. He once protested to those critics, saying: "My intention is to use characters or a group of characters to show the real social situation on the stage for people to see. If the critics want to extract some maxims or something from it, that's their business, but I didn't start writing from a certain maxim..." This is naturally an angry word. In fact, if Pinero's works really "extract" nothing proposition, then he would have lost his glory in the artistic field long ago.</p>
<p>Therefore, even though starting with character setting is also a way of writing, it is by no means to say that it can be a complete work without a theme.</p>
<p>Another way to say is to start with conceiving a very moving situation to write a play. Compared with the above two, this method may be easier and more clever, but the attempt of this method is not without conditions. You must have rich stage experience, theater experience, and be familiar with the psychology of the audience to know what can be used as a "moving and dramatic situation."</p>
<p>The best example of this method should be found in the achievements of Victorien Sardou. He extremely believed in Aristotle's saying that "action is the basic element of drama", and he also extremely believed in what Hugo said —— "The dramatic action is easier to succeed when expressing emotions than using reason." Therefore, the situation he planned focused on using "action" that stimulates the audience's emotions to win. His success had another fortunate encounter, that is, when his career began to unfold, a first-class actress became the pillar of her success. Her name is Sarah Bernhardt. In her performance skills, there are three special skills that others cannot learn: one is to express a kind of tempting emotion with a voice like a turtledove, one is to argue with people in a voice like a crow, and the other is to perform the voice before death. Sardou used her strengths to write many plays suitable for her to perform. In the eyes of others, those plays are naturally unrelated to each other. In fact, they are just that the actress has changed into different costumes; the central characters of each play are just what the author created with her as the object.</p>
<p>This method is generally most suitable for writing comedies and most suitable for writing farces.</p>
<p>Let's say not to start writing a play in this way. For a playwright, it is also necessary to pay attention to the "situation" with strong drama. Because no matter how you write, since you are writing a play rather than other literary works, you have to pay attention to some important situations and increase the harvest in terms of effect. Otherwise, what is written will inevitably become a literary work that is specially appealing to the sense of hearing, rather than a drama "with visual components as the main".</p>
<p>The last way to say is —— the playwright can consciously capture the feeling that he was occasionally aroused at a certain time, at a certain place, and in a certain situation —— capture and translate this kind of feeling that comes and goes with inspiration, and this can also be developed into a play. The famous playwright Hauptmann's "The Weavers" was written in this "way", and "Riders to the Sea" is an outstanding example of this method. According to Mrs. Gregory, the reason why the author Synge of the latter play wanted to write this play was to move the atmosphere felt in the real life of the Aran Islands to the stage for others to infect. Naturally, he was completely successful.</p>
<p>No matter what the way is, in order to hunt for materials, you have to remember a sentence, that is, "Always open your eyes wide, move your joints, and face real life closely."</p>
<h3>Heine's Poem</h3>
<p>— Translated by Liao Xiaofan</p>
<p>Girl! When we were both children,</p>
<p>Two happy and naive children;</p>
<p>We often climbed into the henhouse,</p>
<p>Hiding under the straw, playing games.</p>
<p>We pretended to crow like roosters,</p>
<p>People walked by there,</p>
<p>"Chirp chirp"! They all thought this</p>
<p>It is indeed the love song sung by the rooster</p>
<p>In the courtyard, those wooden cabinets, we framed</p>
<p>Pasted its panels</p>
<p>We lived together inside,</p>
<p>Decorated into an elegant bedroom.</p>
<p>The old cat from the neighbor's house,</p>
<p>Often comes here to visit,</p>
<p>We teach it how to salute, kowtow,</p>
<p>And how to greet health.</p>
<p>Since we got to know it,</p>
<p>I would like to say to it and say that</p>
<p>Those fragmentary words that I have cared for many old cats as before.</p>
<p>We sat and talked properly,</p>
<p>Exactly like those adults.</p>
<p>And mourning that our generation</p>
<p>All the beautiful things become sighs.</p>
<p>"Love, faith and sincerity</p>
<p>No longer exist everywhere,</p>
<p>It's just that the price of coffee is getting higher,</p>
<p>And the society coins are becoming increasingly scarce.</p>
<p>The joy of childhood has passed away,</p>
<p>Everything has become another way,</p>
<p>Money, world and year,</p>
<p>Sincerity, faith and love."</p>

<p>羅闌司 (T. Lawrence 1769-1830) was a renowned English portrait painter of the 18th century. This portrait is of the most famous tragic actress of that time in England; the original is held in the National Gallery of England. His style is rich in emotion, elegant, and unrestrained, placing him alongside耿司保洛, 鞠茲, 羅姆萊, and others, as a member of the Rococo movement; he is also a figure whose contributions occupy a significant place in the history of English art in world art history.</p>
<h3>Year-End Grass</h3>
<p>— 胡膺東</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>The biting cold wind and continuous drizzle of the Christmas season make it seem like an aging person draped in a silk scarf. As I step into the bustling district of this metropolis, watching the surging flow of people and cars, and counting down the days to the end of the year, I feel a sense of urgency in my heart. Yes, I have been making a living in this city for almost a year now. Year-end sentiments evoke myriad feelings.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>Time is inherently ruthless, and life before my eyes seems especially so. In this Christmas season veiled in rain and mist, I have no particular feelings. If there are any, they are extremely ordinary, because, as an ordinary person like myself, I don't have an extraordinary life. Therefore, the confessions I sketch are something I dare not even look at directly.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>In this real world, I am a slow learner. I suffer from the pallid illness of intellectuals. Unhealthy thoughts flow unconsciously from my pen. Life is like this, and what I write cannot be positive. If you call me a new sentimentalist, I must frankly admit it.</p>
<p>Living in a small circle, the world is narrow. Unfortunately, my mouth is a bit swollen, and I cannot stand the reality. The fact that I cannot face reality is also a fact. This contradiction sinks deeper and deeper, and complaints are inevitable. I can only blame myself for not being cultivated enough and for not having a large enough heart. Unable to push away, unable to untangle, my life and writing are trapped in this quagmire.</p>
<p>The days in the quagmire hold me back. I hope to break free from this bondage.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>As long as a person is alive for a minute, their hope is still leaping. The problem is that this hope is artificially arranged, a vestige directed towards the bright side.</p>
<p>I carry hope and stroll on the road of life. A year, a not-so-short period of testing, makes me feel how distant this is from hope.</p>
<p>I live arduously in this city, selling my cheapest youth, working like an ox, regardless of sunshine, heat, wind, or rain. I always have to carry the cross and enter the slaughterhouse of youth to accept the spiritual punishment of the exploiters. Interest and life have separated, and this is what I deeply feel as a poor thing.</p>
<p>A year slips by lightly in this chronic exploitation.</p>
<p>V.</p>
<p>Regarding the future, I harbor a simple extravagance; I only hope that I can bravely break free from the shackles of the spirit, shake off the unhealthy consciousness, pursue my interests, and embrace the side of life that interests me. Here, I extend my hand of passionate desire, hoping that more friends will encourage each other with me, guide me, and nurture me with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The past should be turned into relics, and the future awaits the power of people to explore. Here, let me draw a confession. I hope that the front will no longer be a terrifying execution ground, and I hope even more that I will not smear myself with filth in the mire.</p>
<p>Standing at the end of the year, I confide in the past and look to tomorrow. My heart flows towards the ocean of goodness. In the heavy fog of wind and rain, I yearn for the realm of bright wind and clear moon. Of course, in between, I inevitably have to fight a battle with my limited vitality.</p>
<h3>Characteristics of Short Stories</h3>
<p>— 復君</p>
<p>In Western literature, the term "Fiction" includes three categories: (1) Novel, (2) Novelette, and (3) Short Story, which are discussed here. Many people often confuse Novelette with short stories. In fact, a Novelette is a Novelette, and a short story is a short story. They are two different things, not the same. This is just like some people thinking that the difference between a Novel and a Short Story is only the length of the piece, which is the same mistake. Currently, many literary publications have separate columns for short stories and novels. If we carefully examine their content and structure, some editors and authors really have not clarified the distinction between these two things.</p>
<p>We know that since about the mid-19th century, the trend in world literature has been to move from long to short, from complex to concise; because as a result of the industrial revolution, the competitive pressure of human life has become increasingly urgent, and the concept of time has become particularly precious. Therefore, in poetry, there are very few long poems like those of Homer, Milton, and Dante, which are hundreds of thousands of words long. Everyone is competing to write short lyrical poems (Lysical Poetry). In drama, there are very few that are as long as Shakespeare's Hamlet, which is five acts and twenty scenes. It has gradually changed to five acts and five scenes, then to three acts and three scenes, and finally evolved from three acts and three scenes to "one-act plays." Therefore, in novels, it has also evolved from novels to short stories, to the point of such a flourishing era as it is now, which goes without saying.</p>
<p>The creator of the short story, the American writer Allan Poe, said it well: "In a short story, the author can fully develop his intentions. Therefore, when reading, the reader's soul is controlled by the author, and there is no fatigue or interruption." In reality, what a short story expresses is only one event, one scene, or one mood. It does not depict a panorama of life or society, but only depicts a small part of it, or even just a small fragment; but through the skillful hands of short story writers, "the reader's soul is controlled by the author." When we read the works of excellent short story writers such as Edgar Allan Poe, Guy de Maupassant, Anton Chekhov, and O. Henry, they have their own unique techniques, and in various poses and styles, they grasp a cross-section of life in a short space, and use their gorgeous writing to diligently describe the subtle things that people do not pay attention to, which cannot fail to fascinate us after reading them. This is what distinguishes the short story from the novel, and it is the characteristic of the short story.</p>
<p>At present, there is no lack of excellent short story writers in the Chinese literary world, but many promising writers often cannot withstand the pressure of life and attempt to obtain a little more manuscript fees. They spare no effort to render a short story that can be made completely exquisite and lengthen its length as much as possible, and it has evolved into a novel. As a result, of course, it is empty, powerless, rough, and even worthless to read. On the contrary, there are many great themes that can be properly and methodically organized to complete a novel, but they have become short stories that are "unfinished" due to the author's time and energy, or even due to literary cultivation. A few years ago, the literary world was noisy with the question of "great literary works." A small number of people actually decided whether a literary work was "great" based on the "length" of the novel, which is really too naive!</p>
<h3>Poetic Words</h3>
<p>— 歐陽琴</p>
<p>Do not insult poetry; do not bury poetry: do not rape poetry, poetry is the noblest empress in the wealth of art</p>
<p>The highest realm of poetry is truth, the deepest understanding of poetry is goodness, and the greatest expression of poetry is beauty, and the three are indispensable.</p>
<p>Good poems are easy to remember, easy to read, and easy to sing, but extremely difficult to write.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 137</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>Since the dawn before dawn, when 鶴見 launched the plan at the 安坂 chicken farm, 野猪 conveyed various orders, and 圓子 was in charge of the internal operations, her actions have become the most important link in the chain of this plan. Until about 8:30 in the evening, when 鶴見 left for the airport, he had received a report once. But the most important report should be after the second extra edition of the evening newspaper published that short message. 鶴見 needed to know the reaction of 別府 to this short message to the fullest extent. Whether the actions of 別府 from various departments were reported to 近衛, and what his attitude was after receiving the report, and so on.</p>
<p>But how could 鶴見 obtain this report? They could not, in the name of something, send a radio message to 鶴見 at 飛機山; it seemed that they could also arrange for 野猪 to come to the airport to deliver a message when they got off the plane; in the Staff Headquarters, 鶴見 had several subordinates with "〇" at the beginning of their names, who were in charge of internal work, and it seemed that they could also find a way to deliver a message; if not, 鶴見 himself, before or after meeting with the secretary's office officer on duty at the Staff Headquarters, could also use the excuse to make a phone call to 安坂 or other pre-arranged places to inquire; finally, the secretary's office ordered 鶴見 to take the original car to 別府 to visit 近衛, and there should be an arrangement for delivering a message on the way. All this seemed very possible.</p>
<p>However, why didn't 鶴見 think of this? With 鶴見's espionage knowledge, and the shrewd and capable characters under his command, how could they not have deduced this point with such meticulous and precise thinking power? Since this report was so important, how 鶴見 should sing this play of seeing 近衛 for the second time should be determined based on this report, but what was the reason for not pre-arranging a way to transmit the message? Why did they create a period of silence in this most important period of time, cutting off 鶴見's contact?</p>
<p>What they didn't know was that creating this period of silence was a great knowledge and an extremely clever arrangement. International master spies often create a period of silence before launching a major plan. The greatest function of this period of silence is to reduce the danger of all kinds of "suspicious consequences" to below zero for the main actors. In other words, after the plan is launched, whether the result is success or failure, the role of the main actor can always remain "innocent," and any suspicion will not be involved.</p>
<p>鶴見 is undoubtedly the active center of launching this major plan; but in this section where he appears, he always performs as if everything he is doing is passive, and he is being played by people in a mysterious way, and behind this play is a precise plan, and it is performed very suddenly, so that even such a shrewd 鶴見 has no time to detect it, and falls into the cage.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Tokyo is the neural center where the networks of spies and counter-spies are arranged. The cadres and lackeys who arrange various spy networks create waves without wind, and they create incidents even when nothing is happening. Moreover, 鶴見's sudden return this time is a problem figure in their minds. Even if 近衛 expressed further recruitment of 鶴見, at least that Fifth Column should cooperate with 鶴見, and should often give up hostile surveillance, but the fact is not the case; because two different spy groups absolutely have no possibility of cooperation, and if there is any, it is only limited to mutual use. From this, it can be known that if 鶴見 wants to remain innocent, he should be absolutely insulated from his own group, at least from the time he goes to the airport; so that no special service group can catch a trace of a handle.</p>

<h3>Responsibility</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>As of last night, seventy people had died in the three plane crashes of China Central Airlines and China National Aviation Corporation. Eleven more people are still in the hospital waiting for treatment.</p>
<p>No matter what, the airline should be held responsible for this tragedy, and the transportation authorities should also be held responsible. This responsibility is divided into two aspects:</p>
<p>1.  Thoroughly investigate the reasons why the planes failed to land safely. If there are problems with the equipment, why is the equipment not perfect? For the safety of passengers in the future, ways should be found to improve this aspect immediately.</p>
<p>2.  According to the company, each deceased will be given a consolation payment of one million yuan. This amount is too unreasonable. What can one million yuan be used for? The company should be responsible for compensating for the losses based on the identity of each deceased, etc.</p>
<p>Although the history of civil aviation in the world is short, it has been nearly forty years since then. In these forty years, we have never seen a record of three planes crashing in the same area on the same day. Therefore, some people say that the three plane crashes on Christmas, although they occurred in Shanghai, can be said to be the biggest news in the world.</p>
<p>We are now waiting for the transportation authorities and airlines to give us an explanation on the above two points.</p>
<h3>Icebergs and Snowy Seas, Competing to Hunt Whales - Soviet and Japanese Whaling Fleets Head to Antarctica</h3>
<p>— 魯純父</p>
<p>According to the announcement by the Natural Resources Bureau of General MacArthur's Headquarters, the Japanese whaling fleet heading to Antarctica has obtained more than fifty whales in total. Moscow newspapers reported: "The Soviet Union also has a whaling fleet of nine ships and one large supply ship heading to Antarctica." It seems that the desolate Antarctica is stirred up again by whaling.</p>
<p>Antarctica is an extremely cold region, buried in ice and snow all year round, with towering icebergs floating everywhere. Except for explorers, no one goes there. However, because it is rich in whales, it is the best area in the world for whaling. 雷納, a member of the British Scientific Research Association, went to Antarctica to explore whale tracks in October 1934, floating on the ocean surface for seven months. According to his report after returning, there were as many as two hundred whales a day. Therefore, countries around the world are unwilling to let go of these natural resources lightly.</p>
<p>Before the war, the countries that worked the hardest to hunt whales in Antarctica were Britain and Norway. Every fishing season, more than a dozen whaling ships would depart. Although Germany, Denmark, and Japan had tried a few times, they could not match the two countries of Britain and Norway. But now, the Japanese, with the support of the Americans, are actually strutting their stuff in Antarctica.</p>
<p>Difficult to Catch</p>
<p>Because whales are heavy and powerful, and habitually stir up waves in the ocean, they are very difficult to catch. The famous whaling expert史溫特方 said that he had stabbed a whale as long as ninety-five feet with a harpoon. A Soviet whaler once harpooned a whale overseas in Siberia. It dragged the boat in the sea for seven hours, at a speed of eight nautical miles per hour. The rope was three thousand feet long, and the boat could not keep up with it. Therefore, if whaling is not done properly, one's own life will be lost.</p>
<p>This is an office designed by a British expert for a bank manager.</p>
<p>Whaling began about a thousand years ago; until this century, countries have been desperately catching them, but whales reproduce slowly. If they continue to be caught like this, they are in danger of becoming extinct. However, it is precisely because everyone knows that the whaling industry is an industry that is about to end that whaling companies in various countries have decided on a method of "quickly hunting as much as possible" in order to strive to obtain the largest harvest first.</p>
<p>Great Fight</p>
<p>Whales are playful in nature. They often play chasing games with fishing boats. They float up and down around the boat, swimming back and forth, sometimes playing like this for two or three hours. When they get tired of playing, they wag their tails and swim away. If whalers do not disturb them, they will not hurt people much, but if fishermen stab their sensitive flesh with harpoons, they will cleverly swim out of the range of the fishermen's harpoons, and then fight the fishermen. Therefore, to catch them, you must aim at them and give them a fatal blow, otherwise the entire ship will be in great danger.</p>
<p>In 1937, J.Perno, a scientist who was skilled in whaling, invented an ingenious whaling method. They first built a radio station and lookout post on a mountain three hundred feet high, and used the most precise telescopes to observe the waves on the sea surface to determine the whereabouts of whales. If they found them, the shortwave radio station immediately flashed a flame signal to the whaling ship under the coastal cliffs. Then, they launched a high-speed catch boat with the lightest aircraft engine and shortwave radio command. At this time, the whale would definitely appear near the whaling ship about half a mile away, exchanging fresh air to the sea surface. Therefore, the whaling ship quickly approached the whale's body. Within the range of the harpoon gun on the ship, the gunner under the deck loaded the gun, (this type of shell can automatically explode eight seconds after being fired. Five minutes later, when the whale appears near the ship again, they will rush forward to chase and capture it. At the same time, the gunner turned the gun body towards the whale's body and attacked the whale's abdomen. The whale was in pain and dived into the sea, but because of the automatic explosion of the harpoon head, it still sent the whale out of the sea.</p>
<p>Bombardment</p>
<p>At this time, the gunner fired an electric harpoon into the whale's body, and dragged an electrically conductive wire behind it. Then, the helmsman connected the electric wire to the motor and introduced current. As a result, there was a scream on the sea surface, waves splashed everywhere, and the whaling ship sailed up to fire the final shot to prevent the whale's body from sinking into the sea again. This scientific war on the sea ended in a few minutes. This method has now been widely adopted by various countries.</p>
<p>At present, the whale fishing season has arrived again. In the cold currents of the Southern Ocean, the Soviet Union, Japan, and other countries are competing for whaling again. At present, the world is really full of competition and contradictions between countries in every piece of land!</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Counting Money</h3>
<p>— 陸士雄</p>
<p>I recently heard that the Central Bank will recruit many money counters.</p>
<p>When this fascinating and all-powerful piece of paper - banknotes - is in its gestation period, it must also undergo several times of management and teaching. The first time is to review the large sheets, including: the color of the ink, the printing technology, and the position of the paper, etc. The second is to check whether there are any errors or omissions in the numbers or official seals, etc. The third is to check the number of sheets. The above work is often done by young girls in our country, because women are more meticulous. Therefore, before each banknote flows into the market, it must go through many touches and explorations by women. When people hold a bundle of brand-new banknotes, they may proudly think that they are lovely because they are 'first in my hands'. In fact, they have already tasted the air of rouge and powder, and they are slaves who have been managed by women many times. Here, I am reminded of the American habit of respecting women, where Ladies first in everything. When it comes to the brief history of currency gestation, women are also first! The job of calling female counters may be a new profession and title. Their educational level ranges from junior high school to university. They are a flexible group and must be quick with their hands and eyes to be able to do the job happily.</p>
<p>Banknotes are loved by everyone, and having banknotes to count, even if it means 'burning the midnight oil' or 'braving the wind and rain', they will not be tired. But I think only money counters and female money counters, because they sit in a city of banknotes every day and are with them all day long, will naturally feel bored with seeing banknotes, or even have headaches. The reason for this is still 'for whom are they working so hard?' and only dreaming of being a 'fortune god who passes by'!</p>
<p>Open an old book and take a look. In 'Biographies of Immortals' there is the myth of 'turning stones into gold' and in 'Records After Hearing and Seeing' there is the myth of 'turning iron into gold'. In modern monetary studies, the new example of 'turning paper into gold' should be added. Among our poor public servants, there is only the pain and depression of 'lacking the ability to turn gold' and 'lacking decoration for the New Year'.</p>
<p>To turn the conversation back: the same banknote has different destinies and values. For example, a two-thousand-yuan note, in a wealthy family with assets calculated in the 'billions', this mere two thousand yuan is not even generous to give to a beggar, but in a poor family, it can buy several liters of rice and several pounds of vegetables. Every time a two-thousand-yuan note is used, it must first be caressed, like a loving mother and her beloved child, reluctantly parting! Even after parting, they are still very reluctant to part with it!</p>
<p>I remember that an American economist, R.M. Sauille, had some comments on the value of money. He had a similar view. He said: How much is a dollar really worth? It all depends on who the dollar falls into and what it is used for:</p>
<p>In the hands of a housewife with a fixed income, a dollar is worth a dollar.</p>
<p>In the hands of a widow without a fixed income, it is worth nine dollars.</p>
<p>In the hands of an unproductive elderly person, it is worth five dollars.</p>
<p>In the hands of a young person with a promising future, it may only be worth three cents.</p>
<p>Finally, I believe that the lives of the rich and the banknotes of the poor, which is more important, or whether they are equal, whether they can also be counted.</p>
<p>(Note: This is the answer to the article "Is it a wrongful killing?", which was published in this journal yesterday. It was a dark night without stars or moon. There were people five miles away, so there was no possibility of light. In the dark, no animal's eyes will glow unless there is reflective light; as for human eyes, they will never glow under any circumstances.</p>
<p>Therefore, 白德婁 could not have seen any so-called glowing eyes staring at him in the dark. (If you don't believe it, you can turn off the lights and try it at night.) Obviously, it was a deliberate murder case!</p>

<h3>Those Who Fish in Troubled Waters</h3>
<p>— 張季皋</p>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the United Nations brought in a large amount of relief supplies. The Yangshupu Wharf, which had been deserted for several years, suddenly became lively. Those who had changed careers and started running foreign ships came to life again. Teahouses were where they met. This wharf is mine, that wharf is yours. After the spheres of influence were divided, everyone recruited brothers. With an order to start transportation, hundreds of porters, bending their backs and sweating, moved the mountains of supplies to the shore. Their wages were calculated by the day, and a day's wages were enough to cover a person's life; if they had a family, it would not be very well-off. But working at the wharf was still considered a good job. There was certainly a reason for this. If we pay attention, we can see that the porters all wore old overcoats. Now that the weather is cold, wearing an overcoat is not surprising, but they were dressed like this a month or two ago. The so-called "mystery" lies in this, and it is conceivable that the overcoat has other uses.</p>
<p>The work is completed, and it's time to go back. A large number of canned goods; pork, beef, everything; thousands of bags of flour piled up like a small mountain. This is certainly a temptation. They picked a few big cans, clamped them under their armpits. They really had the skill. They put on their overcoats and swaggered out. No one could tell that they were carrying anything. If it was their turn to move flour one day, they would be extremely happy. When the work was completed, they quickly opened a bag of flour, poured half of it into a pre-prepared bag, clamped it under both armpits, and mixed in.</p>
<p>As time went on, flaws would naturally be revealed; so a few people were caught by the ×× on the shore, but soon everyone got along with them. They put an empty kerosene barrel at the exit. When friends who were carrying things came out, those who carried cans would give cans; those who carried flour would grab a handful of flour. In a while, the barrel was full, so they would change to an empty barrel.</p>
<p>The two American sailors who guarded the cargo hold on the ship rarely asked questions. Later, it became too outrageous, so they caught a few people, locked them up overnight, and released them the next day.</p>
<p>As for the leaders of the porters, they enjoyed the fruits of their labor. The little brothers had to pay tribute to them every day. They really had "everything beautiful," and they went to teahouses every day. Sometimes they opened a can of chrysanthemum evaporated milk, poured hot water on it, and added sugar cubes. They really enjoyed themselves!</p>

<h3>Insufficient Evidence, Feel Free to Guess!</h3>
<p>— Ge Chunliang</p>
<p>"I am going to the cinema now." Chou Lai said to Professor Huo Danai in the club, "I hope you will talk to Uncle John and spend an evening with him. He seems very worried lately."</p>
<p>An hour later, Professor Huo Danai arrived at Chou Lai's home and found the male servant in a state of panic.</p>
<p>The male servant said, "Sir, Mr. John asked me to bring him coffee an hour ago and then locked himself in the study. Now I knock on the door, but he does not answer me."</p>
<p>The two men forced the door open and found Mr. John lying on the floor, with an empty poison bottle beside him. The door to the front balcony of the study was open. After a detailed inspection, Huo Danai returned home. Several hours later, Chou Lai walked into the parlor of his house.</p>
<p>"I thought I would come here for a short stay before going home. Does Uncle John seem very worried?"</p>
<p>"Your uncle is dead. He died of poisoning. Your male servant and I found him lying on the floor. But it was too late to save him."</p>
<p>"How terrible, Professor Huo Danai! Why was the door to the study locked? Do you know?"</p>
<p>"I am also baffled. Has your male servant worked in your home for a long time?"</p>
<p>"For many years," Chou Lai replied, clutching his head with both hands.</p>
<p>"Ah, with such an inheritance, now you can become rich."</p>
<p>"What does that matter? Uncle John is worth more to me than all the money in the world."</p>
<p>"I wish I could believe you," Professor Huo Danai replied, pointing to the movie ticket stub nervously held in Chou Lai's hand, and said, "Relying solely on this is insufficient evidence."</p>
<p>Smart readers, how did Chou Lai arouse the professor's suspicion?</p>
<h3>When You Have Insomnia</h3>
<p>— Zui Yin</p>
<p>Insomnia is not a serious matter unless you take it too seriously yourself.</p>
<p>Occasional one or two hours of insomnia, it is best not to take it as a big deal, and naturally you will accept it calmly the next day! Conversely, it will become more and more lingering and harm your nerves.</p>
<p>The increasing severity of neurasthenia is mostly due to you taking it too seriously; therefore, it becomes a vicious cycle, ultimately becoming unmanageable!</p>
<p>Many methods seem to cure insomnia, but they are useless; methods like counting numbers only make you think, "Oh, why haven't I fallen asleep yet! Fall asleep quickly!" Little do you know that the more you force yourself to fall asleep, the less you can sleep.</p>
<p>The best way is: don't pay attention to it! You close your eyes, and you will always fall asleep! You have such confidence, and that's it. Don't be irritable, suspicious, or get up and walk around; you must have the determination: lie down until you fall asleep! Even if you lie down all night. (In fact, that's not the case.) In this way, even if you suffer from insomnia for many nights, you can pass it safely, and soon, the demon of insomnia will flee because he knows you are a strong person, and he cannot aggravate your neurasthenia!</p>
<p>In fact, as long as you exercise a little during the day, and do not write articles or talk loudly before going to bed, you will not suffer from insomnia! Wen Hua</p>
<p>At a grand wedding ceremony, the groom noticed that one of the guests seemed displeased. "Have you kissed the bride?" (Note: According to Western customs, guests should kiss the bride at the wedding to show their congratulations.) He asked, hoping to cheer up this unhappy guest.</p>
<p>The guest looked into the distance and said unhappily, "Not recently."</p>
<p>News Figure</p>
<h3>General Qin Dechun</h3>
<p>— Mi Shan</p>
<p>General Qin Dechun, who was recently ordered to come to Shanghai to be responsible for handling the Jiangwan ammunition depot explosion case, is the current Director of the Ministry of National Defense, styled Shaowen. He is a soldier of orthodox background, graduating from the second class of the Infantry Department of the Baoding Military Academy and the sixth class of the Army University. He has served as Chief of Staff, Regimental Commander, Brigade Commander, Division Commander, and Army Commander. During the Great Wall Resistance against Japan, he served as Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Third Army Corps, and severely damaged the Japanese invaders at Xifengkou and Luowenyu on the Great Wall Line. General Qin became famous for this battle, becoming a prominent figure in China's history of resistance against Japan.</p>
<p>In 1933, he served as Deputy Commander of the Twenty-ninth Army and Chairman of Chahar Province. In 1935, he was transferred to be the Mayor of Beiping. At that time, the enemy was actively plotting aggression and repeatedly made many rude and unreasonable demands to the Pingjin authorities. General Song Zheyuan was not in Beiping, and it was General Qin who was responsible for negotiating with Matsui Iwane. When the Lugouqiao Incident suddenly broke out, it was entirely thanks to the proper handling of Qin, Zhang Zhizhong, and Feng Zhian that the foundation for resisting the enemy was laid. Subsequently, Qin transitioned to a purely military position, fighting in various places in central and southern Hebei.</p>
<p>Before the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense, Qin was the Director of the Military Affairs Department. After being transferred to the position of Vice Minister of National Defense, one major event that everyone will not forget is his trip to Japan this summer to testify at the Far East International Tribunal, accusing the Japanese war criminals Doihara and others of their crimes. Because Qin had personally experienced the enemy's various conspiracies on the eve of the War of Resistance, he was able to speak persuasively.</p>
<p>Qin is a native of Yixian County, Shandong Province, and his hometown is now occupied by the Communist army. He is now fifty-four years old and has authored the book "Memories of Beiping." In his spare time, he only likes to read books and practice calligraphy, and has no other hobbies.</p>
