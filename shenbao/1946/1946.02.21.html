<p>〔本報重慶廿日電〕重慶沙磁區各校學校，以東北形勢日趨嚴重，羣情激昻，連日分別集會醞釀第二次愛國大遊行，各牆頭分貼標語壁報，其顯著者有「反對政府軟弱外交」「共產黨出賣祖國」「國家利益高於一切」「檢舉賣國間諜」「反對秘密外交」等標語，而平時色彩顯露之過激份子，大都銷聲息跡，不敢再在羣衆之前露臉。</p>
<h3>中法新約談判內容　王外長半赴巴黎提早簽訂</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿日電〕消息靈通方面預料，俟中國外交部長王世杰抵達巴黎後，當可使中法新的，提早簽訂，越南北部華軍之撤退，當可隨該的之成立而實現。其他尙在討論中之問題，有：（一）治外法權，法人認爲在新的成立前，仍保留其在華之治外法權，（二）法國天主敎會在中國之財產權，（三）海防建立自由港，（四）滇越鐵路之讓與中國，（五）華軍駐越南之佔領費等。又關於越南維明堂與法當局之談判，各方仍力持　默，據悉法內閣昨曾討論此事，殖民部長慕台特曾就越南局勢，提出檢討。</p>
<h3>蘇仍掌握東北交通綫　張嘉展期離渝　毛澤東周恩來在延安會商</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶廿日電〕據悉：東北各地交通綫，目前仍由蘇軍負責管理，在東北重要都市中，蘇軍均派有各軍事交通特派員，專門管理鐵路運輸等事宜。</p>

<h3>馬歇爾仍將留華　美軍事顧問團計劃完成</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九日電〕美駐華特使馬歇爾元帥在任務未完成以前，仍將留華。基倫二級上將，屬於陸軍部，馬帥則係代表杜魯門總統與國務院，馬歇爾元帥現正準備啓程赴中國各地視察。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九日電〕今日自權成方面獲悉：美國駐華軍事顧問團之計劃業已完成，並已獲得最高軍事與政治長官之核准，目前僅等待杜魯門總統作最後之批准。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶十九日電〕周恩來又已飛回延安，與毛澤東接洽，同時，外長王世杰昨自南京向蔣主席請示回渝後，即與蔣經國及張嘉璈磋商，各方奔走頻煩，可知國共雙方又在互爭東北之控制權。</p>
<p>〔聯合社延安十九日電〕周恩來今日返抵此間，會見毛澤東，周氏對此行任務不願有所表示，或係討論東北局勢。據悉，中共方面已於一星期前，向政府要求談判東北地方自治及承認並改編東北方面三十萬軍隊問題，聞周恩來勾留一宵，明日即將遄返重慶。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九日電〕國務卿貝爾納斯今日告報界謂，國務院尚未獲得蘇軍自東北撤退之證明。渠謂：美國已要求中，蘇兩國，將有關東北談判進行情形，通知華儲，中，蘇政府尚未置覆。國務卿貝爾納斯表示希望謂：朝鮮境內美，蘇聨使委員會，可於三月初起開始工作，以處置各種經濟與行政問題，對於北緯三十八度朝鮮南北分界一事，非俟該委會開始工作，唯望有所進展。繼又透路：艾契森決定返日，祖任麥克阿瑟統帥之政治問題</p>
<p>〔中央社紐的十九日合衆電〕紐的前鋒論壇報論稱，中國東北目前之情况，使期盼美，蘇兩國保持良好關係之人士失望，該地最近未來之發展，將爲美，蘇兩國能吾樹立友好關係之試金石，有此種試騐或爲幸事，此種試騐，將給與較目前之事實，更爲淸晰之指示。而表明前此爲亞洲東北地區而商定之國際合作，是否爲事實，或僅為外表堂皇，而無意義之字句而已。</p>
<h3>本年度國防大計決定　實行建設空海軍　陸軍各將領分別離京返防</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕重慶訊：軍事復員會議決策這一的「精兵主義」，並不限於國，聞本年長議定之力防大計，對精練空軍，重建海軍，亦有適合時宜之決定。今後中國空軍及海軍之青島。以目前政府所採之措施觀之，將來中國空軍與海軍之建設信條，顯亦重質而不重量，觀於海軍僅設一處，而暫時不言設部，空軍單位之日見其少，亦足說明今日中國不但海軍與空軍之一切建設均須重質而不重量　，雖機構本身亦然。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕出度軍事復員會議各將領，今日上午已有五分之一返防，留京各將領今日全日曾參觀駐防京幾之七十四軍作野外演習。七時，陸軍總部在勵志社舉行晚會，並演出平劇·話劇，雖節目精彩，但與會者殊不見踴躍，蓋各將領以大　雖除，但仍瘡痍滿目，不忍盡情遊樂，急欲返防。聞明日止下午有大批將領返防，梅蘭芳已中止來京。</p>
<p>會發言人談稱：整軍計劃夫定大批高級將領退休，會中重要決議如下：（一）設立作戰部隊，代替現有軍團。（二）縮編軍隊爲九十師。（三）多數軍長改任師長。（四）改善軍隊配備，以增強各師傅實力。（五）充實第團力量，（六）每師編入砲兵一團。</p>
<h3>修路工作阻礙增加　已遭遇嚴重試驗　魯省境內共軍調動忙碌</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日急電〕交通界訊，復路工作現已遭遇嚴重試騐，因目前準備修復津浦膠兩路之器才人工，雖已陸續到達工段，但工作究能於何日開始，殊難預期。據由徐州以北督修鐵路歸來之工程人員談，三日以來，修路障碍已視前有加，且聞魯境共軍，調動甚忙，似與東北局勢有關。又據消息靈通者言，如修復工程不能於今後之五日內進行無阻，此事可能成為畫餅。此以共軍魯南軍區以內之擋路者，目前對購糧一事，甚感興趣，餘均諉爲不知。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平廿日電〕據今日華文報紙消息：國軍與共產軍在股漢鐵路上何定南約五里處發生衝突。華方消息並稱：在河南北部之安陽，又有接觸。鐵道督修小組預定於今日離此赴安陽，監督該省內之鐵路修理工作。今日此間獲悉：食米與蕃署約四十五萬斤已抵達山東省之泰安，預定在國共與美方委員聨使織之糧食委員會指導之下，將立即開始分配工作。</p>
<h3>港附逆嫌疑犯受審</h3>
<p>〔合衆社香港廿日電〕香港附逆嫌疑犯七十至九十人，中六人昨日下午第一批開始受審。</p>
<h3>昆明費機塲　更名陳納德</h3>
<p>本月初建議滇省府，請將昆明飛機塲改名陳納德機塲，並在機塲附近建設小型公園，園中立碑，紀念陳將軍在華功動，此項建議，已於十九日省府會議中通過照辦。</p>
<h3>李烈鈞在渝逝世</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿日電〕革命元勳中監委李烈鈞，向患血壓過高，入春以來，舊恙趨劇，速日經醫診治未效，廿日晚十時廿分在渝逝世，李年六十五歲。</p>
<h3>專論　門胡開放與現階段的中國均勢</h3>
<p>— 施志剛</p>
<p>一　強國的使運沒落了</p>
<p>國內方面，政治協商雖吿成功，而政黨合作從事建設事業，還在渺茫的期望中。政治的不安造成經濟和社會的潰壞，一切設施都不能使人民滿意，而當局已經感到焦頭爛額。民主的呼聲，徒然增加了紊亂，並不曾促使實際進步。內在的矛盾使中國不能步英蘇兩國的後塵，立刻走上復興大道。全國人民的視綫，都集中在國內秩序的安定一個問題上面，而對於外來勢力的深入多少削弱了注意。國際勢力消長演變中，中國被動地又成了世界問題的焦點。這一次勝利雖曾造成我們千載一時的轉機，而這個機會眼看又將「坐失」。說得迫切一點，中國簡直又將踏上次殖民地的地位了。固然聯合國中，中國是四强之一，但是中國所以能够成爲强國的勝利，却是「恥辱的勝利」。這是怎樣說呢？</p>
<p>第一，中國打勝了，却把外蒙古的宗主權丟掉了。雖然這是合於民族主義和大西洋憲章民族自次的原則，但是爲什麼一定要在戰勝之後的今天纔由蘇聯和我們訂立同盟協定規定這樣做呢？第二次世界大戰中戰勝國而丟掉領土的祇有波蘭和我國，試問我們自處怎樣的地位？其次，盟國在華有駐軍。雖然中國是四强之一，但是許多方面太像伊朗，太像希臘。我們的仗，靠別人打勝了，所以別人的軍隊可以駐在我國，協助受降，或者延不撤退。尤其是東北，蘇軍一再延期，不肯立即撤退。這情形，試問同義和團之役中國戰敗後，俄軍　棧不退的情形，有什麼兩樣？再說，日本戰敗了，所以要受外國的監視。千涉，而在我們戰勝國的國內，也有變相的彼此爭奪權益，任憑他人處理，名義雖不同，而實際上和戰敗國一樣，這是何從說起？</p>
<p>非特戰後國力特別膨脹的美蘇兩國，積極伸展勢力於吾國；甚至連與我們情形同其「悽慘」的英法兩帝國主義國家，也有意無意的企圖恢復它們的本來面目，幻想在這一個覺醒的團土上苟延它們昏庸的殘夢。九龍屏山機塲事件和上海白爾丁事件以及馬來。暹羅等處所表演的排華慘劇，正足以說明我們的斷語。</p>
<p>我們可以從這紊亂的屋子裏推開窗十瞭望世界。中國以外的世界，在這次戰後已顯然地形成了三個分野——新興資本主義的美國，社會主義的蘇聯，和英法等沒落帝國主義的集團。它們正各自憑恃自已的制度和形式，企圖積極的擴展勢力，儘可能伸展到世界的任何一角。中國，可能成爲超然於三大勢力圈以外的獨立個體，也更可能被它們任何一個所吸收，這是一個最大的競爭塲。這是歷史上戰國的復演。</p>
<p>這是一個極大的危機，在民族競爭塲中，我們自身的力量太微弱，而又加以我們的注意力正集中於久懸不次的國內問題。假使一定要從內部的權利分淸着手，然後再伸展到世界去，那時候，也許朝鮮已不再獨立，越南又要自主不成，南洋的華僑已被排斥殆盡，而我們自身的命運，竟已被別人所「註定」了。</p>
<p>總之，如果長此以往大家不覺醒，我們依舊處在被支配的地位，曇花一現的「强國」命運，已難免沒落之嘆！</p>
<p>二　蘇聨勢力向東方伸展</p>
<p>埃，里務（Emery　Reves）在他所著「和平的剖析」（The　Anatomy　of　Peace）一書中，曾有這樣的話—</p>
<p>蘇聯外交政策的發展路綫與其他强國的路綫全然相同——同盟，勢力範圍，勢窮力蹙時的權宜與妥協，軍事勝利後的擴展，共產主義祇是蘇聯的手段，用爲達到這一個目的——一個民族主義的大目的。……</p>
<p>一九二〇年以後，共產主義已逐漸减少其重要性，而民族主義部繼續增高。在早期的二十五年中，共產國際雖野心甚大，然其影響，則未能遠出國門。可是極權的蘇維埃民族國家却繼之而來。即在諸外國的共產黨派，確係受莫斯科所鼓勵的，亦已置其使本國社會主義化的鬥爭於一旁，而漸變爲蘇聯民族主義政策的工具。彼等所採之態度，並非基於樹立共產主義的需要，而係基於增强蘇聨國際地位的需要。</p>
<p>依這樣說法來解釋，爲什麼有東歐國家集團？爲什麼土耳其要重申立場？爲什麼伊朗要請求聯合國調解？都是顯而易見的。</p>
<p>這種動亂和擾攘，不但見之於蘇聯西陲的各隣國，同時也見之於蘇聯東部鄰邦的中國。除了去年中蘇同盟協定所規定的事項以外，蘇聯的影子更閃遍我國的東北和西北。約如下列—</p>
<p>一，伊寗事變，自去年哈薩克民族暴動以後，迪經政府派員綏靖談判，允許高度自治。最近盛傳「東土耳其斯坦共和國」又在助亂了。</p>
<p>二，外蒙古唐弩烏梁海地區併入蘇聯，改稱「丹努杜佛省」，並非外蒙公民投票所決定。</p>
<p>三，內蒙及東北的興安嶺一帶，又產生自治政權。</p>
<p>四，對東北方面，又有新經濟談判。</p>
<p>以上都是是根據最近的報道，而所謂合法的條約規定尙且在外。計有——</p>
<p>一，中蘇協定中國承認外蒙獨立。中蘇共管中國長春鐵道，旅順軍港中蘇共用，由蘇聯駐防。大連成爲自由市。</p>
<p>二，雅爾協定，除中國方面外，蘇聨又佔據千島列島及南部庫頁。</p>
<p>三，聯合國決定，朝鮮五年託管。蘇軍駐守朝鮮半島北部。總括起來，蘇聯在東亞的收穫，實已相當鉅大。無怪美國人看得眼紅，指爲蘇聯已恢復了沙皇時代的權利。</p>
<p>據未證實的消息，蘇聯更有劃分中國長春鐵路一帶爲「安全走廊」的要求。同時，錦州東北行營又將成立，看來遼東西將成爲中蘇兩大勢力的分野。如果這趨勢不能挽回，那和北　時代滅遼以後收不回燕雲十六州，又有什麼兩樣？</p>
<p>我們可以從這一點證明埃。里務的話，的確有它存在的理由。</p>
<p>我們不能單獨責備英美在阿爾泰協定中的出賣政策。蘇聨能够要求恢復帝俄時代的權利，那麼，同樣是戰勝國，爲什麼我們就不能恢復前淸時候所喪失的一切權利呢？總而言之，「弱國無外交」是事實。退一步說，我們假使把這一次戰事中國的利害得失，和克里米亞戰爭中的土耳其，或和第一次大中的意大利相比較，那麼未始不可慰情聊勝於無」。</p>
<p>對於東北的現養，，誠如美國人所說，同第一次大戰之後的山東問題一樣棘手。蘇聨和日本太相像了。蘇聯已經完全無缺地承繼了帝俄。我們試看帝俄對中國的手段怎樣？它每當中國能收到一點不勞而獲的成果。英法聯軍之役，淸帝逃出北京，與英法成立城下之盟；俄使伊格業替夫從中調停和平，結果俄國獲得江東六十四屯之地。陝甘回亂之役，俄國更出面交涉，結果中國喪失伊犂河下游一帶地方。甲午中日之役，中國割　遼東半島，由俄德法三國出面干涉收回，結果成立中俄密約，造成此度中蘇軍事同盟協定各條件的歷史基礎，此後雖經蘇聨一度鄭重聲明放棄而雅爾泰協定中又出爾反爾要求繼承！當時帝俄更慫恿德法二國分別佔據膠澳及廣州灣，形成淸示幾遭列强瓜分的危機。辛亥革命之役，俄國又鼓動外蒙章嘉呼圖克圖的獨立，如此之例，不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>此次中蘇軍事同盟協定，中蘇兩簽字國均為安定民主陣營的甚石，這一協定，足以保障太平洋西岸秩序的安定；貢獻偉大，自無庸多所揣測。然就近來新談判的傳說推想，愈益使人緬懷過去歷史，而有戰戰兢兢的觀感。</p>
<p>復次，再試從甲午以來日本侵華史的種種觀察，諸如：鼓勵少數民族，造成附庸政權，積極陰謀分裂；慘殺寺方負責人員（如蔡公時烈士），藐視中國主權；以及養養亡清餘孽，包藏禍心等等，詭計多端，自難一手掩盡世界耳目。日寇笨抽按兩，無非陰謀削弱中國，便利自身的擴張，誠爲侵略者之允。此度大戰之後，侵略勢大消滅殆盡，我人希望任何國家能以日本爲設鑑，不再妄想侵犯中華民國的主權。（未完）</p>

<h3>原子彈製造秘密　仍握於美國掌中　加拿大決肅清國內奸逆　偵查間諜案續有嫌欵犯被捕</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九日電〕美國務卿貝爾納斯今日向報界指稱：關於製造原子彈之秘密知識，迄今仍在美政府保守中，此中秘密並未爲加拿大所發生之任何國際間諜探得也。關於美英加享有之原子彈情報方面，貝爾納斯又作一明期之正式聲明，略謂，原子彈製造秘密，即英加兩政府亦無所知，遑論其他國家。渠稱，加拿大問諜案份子，並無佈置於美國之情事，美國公民亦並不與該案有所牽涉。渠又稱：渠並無理由在美逮捕任何案犯，渠不信原子彈實騐室主任格魯夫斯少將曾發表關於原子彈若干秘密已被洩漏之言詞。貝氏謂最近曾晤及格氏，格氏始終並無此種淤曾。果如外間所傳，謂蘇聯秘密人員曾偸帶滿載間諜案文件之箱籠而尙能潛離美國海港云云，渠將不勝驚異。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九日電〕今日「託倫多明星日報」載稱，加拿大將要求國內一切與間諜有關之蘇特務人員退出加國。「加拿大將堅持一蘇聯大使館之人事總淸掃行動，並要求採取措施，務使不再發生偵取加國軍事及科學秘密之運動。」蒙特利爾雜誌今日對蘇聯控稱，「蘇聯擬於加拿大市塲上，拋出價值十二萬五千鎊之黑市鈾產之計劃已被發現。」</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社渥太華二十日電〕洩湘原子彈秘密案仍在神秘神狀中，內閣曾於昨日開會，但事後並未發表聲明。據當局宣稱：政府首要目標，在肅淸國內奸逆，據聞被捕嫌疑犯中，有巨奸十餘名，其中一部份，以詐財爲業，少數則爲職業性間諜。</p>
<p>〔聯合社渥太華二十日電〕加政府今日宣布，關於「原子間諜綱」一事，政府已準備續發公告，以澄清不分皂白之謠　　言。內閣鑒於全世界注意此案，及外界無的放矢之猜疑，頗為不安，並亟欲對政府偏員之犯有　漏秘密嫌疑者加以注意，且知其中若干人職位極高。</p>
<p>〔法新聞社倫敦十九日電〕據此間明星夜報本日載稱：英陸軍部情報處價騎四出，開始有關加原子秘密洩漏案之偵查工作，目前正向倫敦市區以及駐有加拿大部隊之南部諸郡進行搜索。</p>

<h3>為印憲政開闢途徑　英要員使命重大　從印人本身覓取解決方案</h3>

<p>美軍法庭自本月初開始審判日戰犯十八名以來，至今已達第三星期，本來計劃於昨日正式宣判，但因各種口供與辯論，均未完成，其宣判期將改爲本星期六。被吿辯論律師哈金斯克守職責，似欲脫各氾於罪，或至少减輕彼等之罪名，但原吿辯論律師韋斯特，亦當仁不讓，極力為已死者伸寃，於是法庭之間，舌戰時起，使主審官五人，有左右爲難之勢。哈金斯舉出二點欲得勝訴。（一）各氾爲執行上峯命令，不得不逆意奉行，以盡軍人天職。（二）推翻各氾原來口供，使彼等卸罪他人。昨日法庭曾先後傳日三十四軍司令鏑本正雄少將·福本龜治上校·及酒井定次少校·出庭提取口供。此三人狡賴多端，有時說「不記得」，有時說「不知道」，有時又說「我沒有做此事」。但觀三人之貌，並非糊塗或善忘之人，昨晨哈金斯中校對到庭少設人松浦覺，問以關於日本軍中命令在戰時之重要性，松浦覺說等於天皇之命，蓋哈金斯欲從各犯因服從命令一點中减輕彼等之罪名。旋傳駐漢口憲兵司令福本龜治上校。此人年五十二，髮已斑白，自稱對遊行之事不贊成，只奉命派憲兵出動合作，而派憲兵合作之理由有三：（一）爲保護美飛行員，（二）爲預防彼等逃脫或自較，（三）軍令如山，不可違反·韋斯中校於此時以其口供出示，請求　釋「懲罰」之意義·福本堅不承認有參與行爲，並以卅四軍司令忠野正義及憲兵總司令服部守次之話爲證，其言曰：「你們不必担憂，一切由我負責。』問其知吾所作所爲，有遠國際公法及人道，福本說：「知道，故不贊成。」至是，法官退庭。下午再傳福本　治，彼仍假裝糊塗，屢次搖頭說：「不知道。」法官再傳酒井定次少校，酒井定次年五十，農夫出身，在軍中服務已有三十年，有妻子一，兒女六人，據稱，殺害美飛行員之事發生後，彼得情報部泉毅一中尉（在逃）之報吿，方知其情，當時日軍心理，以爲可以藉此遊行機會，大事宣傳，並僞稱日人已打落美國飛機，同時並可平漢口人民之憤。彼當時曾與福本龜治談及此事，福本說怕會有麻煩，但旣是命令，只好執行，「我毫無辦法。」韋斯中校問：「參加殺害美飛行員之人，是否由你這派。」答：「是的，但只指派一人，並未指出要派任何人。」於是韋斯中校又宣讀其口供之一部，該犯反稱口供稍有錯誤，於是因爲「懲罰戰犯」及「侮辱戰犯」二字義之差別，又累得翻譯員翻了半個鐘頭字典，酒井定次又不承認曾簽字於命令紙上，其口供與以上二人大同小　　異。昨日費時五小時，竟毫無結果。</p>
<h3>中華煙草公司　三廠開工</h3>
<p>月出捲烟五千大籍</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部接管之敵資中華烟草公司，自上月十一日奉合復工以來，迄今已有第一第二第三各廠開工。三廠共有捲煙機六十五架，現大部業已開動，每月可出捲烟五千大箱。據聞目前原料之不源，尚不困難。最近青島方面，可望　有大批煙葉裝到，前經濟部烟草組所接管之各捲烟廠，除　標賣成發還者外，全部將劃歸該公司經營。該公司組織及　營章程，刻已起草完竣，正待關係當局審核通過，性質大致與中國紡織建設公司及中國蠶絲公司等相類似。該公司經營時期，定爲二年，期限屆滿，發售公司設票俾便移交民營。目前在董事會尙未產生前，總經理一職·暫由經濟部指定由楊錫仁充任。</p>
<p>華商煙廠籌復工</p>
<p>又據此間結商煙廠業公會負責人告稱：本市華商烟廠登記入會者，共達六十五家。實際開工生產者，當在三十家以上。大廠如華成南洋等，正在籌備復工中。目前捲烟原料如烟葉紙圈等，雖存底尙充，惟來源仍未十分疏暢。且捲烟之從價征稅，負担亦重，故亟望華商烟廠，能極力設法自力更生，以　華商捲烟之地位。</p>

<h3>美軍剩餘物資　將接受各界承購</h3>
<p>最大主顧為聯合國善救署</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：美國外淸理委員會「出價及承諾計劃」下所應處理之美軍剩餘物資，一月內可望即將公開接受市府及其他工商企業界出價承購。該會迭接各界探詢剩餘物資之問題，現該會正積極將太平洋區內，包括冲繩島關島等地之剩餘物資，分門別類。惟華東及上海地區，是否有剩餘軍用品，則尙屬疑問。</p>
<p>本市之出價人，仍將給予承購太平洋區內美軍各前哨綫之剩餘物資。該會刻已獲得還輸飛機一架，不久將再得一架，俾載運各出價人飛赴各處</p>
<p>實地參觀</p>
<p>剩餘物資，以明究竟，聞該會在本市標售剩餘物資，頗爲謹愼將事。每一出價人之背景，及其對各方面之關係，均將經審核。該會有權拒絕發售任何剩餘物資，並表白「美政府並不擬涉足於零躉營業，且不擬供給「投機取巧者以鉅利」云。而處理美軍留華剩餘物資之</p>
<p>整個目標</p>
<p>在協助善後救濟工作。故美國剩餘物資之最大主顧，即聯合國善後救濟總署是也。聯總現已獲得大批剩餘物資，尤以運貨車及建築材料居多。聯總更將大量吸收美軍之剩餘糧食。現本市各界申請所需者，以各種。</p>
<p>車輛居多</p>
<p>此中尤以吉普車為最。惟據某一觀察家稱：大都之出價人，咸屬商人，頗擬利用此項剩餘物資，以巷代來自美國之進口貨。惟據測訪項出價人獲得剩餘物資之希望，將色為渺茫。據悉：該會對各項剩餘物資，將視其地點種類及情況之不同。而</p>
<p>分類定價</p>
<p>然後再公開招標承購。在一定之日期內，投標書通同承購保證金百分之十，必須送達該會。開標時各投標者將被邀出席。該會在接受前，對出價人將作面面俱到之考慮，如因特殊原因，則出高價之人，亦有被吾決之事發生。又據吿此間最近有剩餘之運輸飛機一批，架數不詳，業已</p>
<p>售與聨總</p>
<p>，中國航空公司及中央航空公司等。目前該會對出價人分爲三種：對某數種主要剩餘物資，聯總高居優先權之鰲首，中國政府次之。本市之出價人，則歸入第三種「其他」類中。</p>

<h3>流動市塲交易下　金鈔同時回漲　資料夾券不公開買賣　華股對做價徵升</h3>
<p>烚赤昨因銀根鬆動，買氣轉盛，證交大樓因有當局巡查，諸多不便，交易移往四川路一帶，暗中進行，晨初即微見趨榮，為一四二萬，賣買極形困難，雖屬零星交易，亦易波動，一度自一四五萬同挫至一四〇萬，無如國際周勢旣刺激人心，銀根轉鬆，復助長買戶活動，午收又回漲至一四五萬以上，較前收漲起半成，午後續有零星之搜羅者，喊高至一五〇萬左右，趨勢頗爲堅穩，飾金仍無掛牌，紋銀一千六，銀元八〇〇元左右，暗拆續鬆，息價的一角半至二角。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔仍隨金市進退，初時在二千元關內外盤旋，百元券拒絕交割，買戶不易獲得籌碼，遂自一九八〇元左右漸盤漸堅，金市回好，二千元關外遂吿站定不破，竟盤好至二〇五〇元前後，較前收漲起六十元，港票老貨以港地申鈔報三七，匯水七九折，三三〇元左右有賣少買，港電在三四〇元以上，新貨八〇至八五元，均見小挫。</p>
<p>公債華洋股票均無集會，不公開之賣買讓受，在雙方實際需要下，計公債初時在前收價盤旋，最後回小半成，華股則較前收價稍昇，稍有對做，外股則一遍賣價，喊價在前收價以下，少數有供無求。</p>

<p>昨日現棉交易較爲减色，殆銀根緊迫，而紡建公司忽存觀望，交易，計進棉米得林及火機花周浦籽花等一百餘件。</p>
<h3>呢羢銷路暢達</h3>
<p>昨呢號交易大有進展，本市大小各區西服帮，南京杭州裁縫帮，咸有强健進胃，零星交易，多於原疋原箱，因在今日之高物價下，大半只求配合各種花色，其能購辦原箱與整疋呢羢者，十僅一二而已，又昨日紡建公司已開出一批呢羢云。</p>

<p>棉布市塲交易閑散，客帮依然趦趄不前，加以中國紡織建設公司賡續供售棉布，爲抑平市價之先聲，是故布市被莫能興。</p>
<h3>綢市先疲後堅</h3>
<p>綢市平穩，晨開即小，終因廠盤成本未見減低，業中人乘賤吸購，市勢先疲後堅，美亞被面初開一〇九萬，賣出，收盤一百十萬買進，大誠璧縐由三千七百四十元步升至三千八百三十元，午後一致趨昻，絲市堅挺，按現今市價尙不足產地成本，市况一致看高。</p>

<h3>紅茶趨勢穏定</h3>
<p>連疲數日之紅茶，趨勢已轉平定，至其原因，一部份被銀根緊迫之散戶，吐售巳吿稀少，且大戶堅售如故，所以買者納胃雖少，市氣尙能站穩，結果比上日均鮮變遷，至於緣茶，在進胃畫集下，人心依然不餒，各貨成交價均極樂觀。</p>

<p>言論</p>
<h3>新女性的「再出發」！</h3>
<p>— 鮑石溪</p>
<p>劃時代的建國聲中，新女性應齊一步伐；向着劇時代的建設大路「再出發」！</p>
<p>過女的「婦女運動」失敗了：</p>
<p>（一）在心理方面：喪失自信。倚賴盲從。虛僞自欺。消極和被動心理的存在。</p>
<p>（二）在倫理方面：無「修身·齊家·治國」的求軒觀念。無「重禮尚義，明廉知恥」的德性。不鼓勵男子「為國盡忠，為民族盡考。」不為「公而記私，國而忘家」。</p>
<p>（三）在社會方面：不求社會「現代化」。無合作精利。不爲「新社會」的實現而努力。不深入農村。不着重建國的基層工作。</p>
<p>（四）在政治方面：不本於國家的需要與時代的潮流而奮鬥。無確定遠大的目標。無崇明的志向—不立志在邊疆，不致力於政治建設，不以報國救民爲抱負。</p>
<p>（五）在經濟方面：無簡單樸素的生活；顚倒「十里洋塲」紙醉金迷的夢境。不「自力更生」。無技術知識。不致身於農。工。商業的發展。不求實際工作。不求創造。不求發明。不立志做技術人員。工程師。不謀「享受大衆化」。</p>
<p>過去的，已成「叫日黃花」了，不必留戀，也不必悲傷。但願今後的「新生命，從茲開始。</p>
<p>東方的「弱不經風」，「可掌土舞」的「睡美人」啊，起來！時代的巨輪，已走上原子威脅的時期，不再容妳甜睡了！不再容妳「寄生」了。邁妳們的雙足，齊起步伐，大着膽，向傳統的思想挑戰！向建設的路途邁進！</p>
<p>讓我們展開「新女性運動」的雄姿，「再出發」！</p>
<p>第一，剷除倚賴盲從的心理，不務虛榮，不事奢侈，不度浪漫生涯。要求實學，打倒「女子無才便是德」的陳舊思想；愚民政策！專心讀書，好自修養，埋頭研究。一洗過去的消極和被動心理。實行簡單樸實的新生活。</p>
<p>第二，致力於社會工作，謀理想的「新社會」的實現。務求社會「現代化」。倡導合作運動。實踐建國的基層工作；深入農村，啓發文盲，救濟貧弱，爲人羣謀福利。</p>
<p>第三，新女性應「自力更生」。運用手腦。立志爲敎員。機械員·工程師·飛行員。醫師·藥劑師·護士·參政員。致身於社會敎育文化工作，致身於科學研究工作，謀農工作商各業的新發展。</p>
<p>第四，要立志做大事，但不要做大官。確定遠大的目標，以報國救民爲終身抱負，爭取婦女參政權，謀婦女的精神和肉體的解放！爲人類的「自由。平等與幸福」而致力。培養未來世界的鮮艷花朶。</p>
<p>從今以後，新女性不再是「手無搏鷄之力」和「腦無一點思想」的「目不識丁」的人物，而是身心健全，有實學·有技能·有前進思想的女子。對兒女，不僅是「良母」，而應是「賢師」；不可「溺愛不明」，而要「循衛善誘」敎導有方。對丈夫，不僅是「賢妻」，而常是革新的「賢內助」；不可「助紂爲虐」—無「明廉知恥」的德性，無「建國的信仰」；無「救國的道德」。而須要給以精神上的鼓勵；不營私，不舞弊；爲國家盡全忠，爲民族盡大孝。</p>
<p>社會</p>
<h3>房東房客應和衷共濟</h3>
<p>— 莉</p>
<p>目前上海的房屋非常缺乏，有許多從內地來的人，一時找不到房屋，局處在旅館裏。上海鬧着房荒，自然有牠的原因。一則在戰爭時期，已經破壞的房屋，沒有建設起來；二則上海的人口，一天天地增加，但房屋的建築，並沒有增多。</p>
<p>然而因爲房荒而利用機會，實行漁利的，也大有人在，一般二房東把他們的房屋出租一部份，需索大得驚人的頂費，也有藉口合同期滿，收回自用，以致與三房客大起交涉的，也是日有所聞。</p>
<p>本來上海的二房東，生就一副特別的面目，（自然良善的二房東並不是沒有）在出租房屋的時候，對三房客絕對歡迎，但相處了一個時期，不是今天限制電燈，就是明天限制自來水，在二房東和三房客之間，弄得水火不相容，這種情形，對於社會秩序的建設，和家庭生活的改善，大有阻礙。</p>
<p>在二房東方面應該認淸目前一切尙沒有恢復正常，即使在美國也鬧着房荒，一時不易建設所需要的房屋。他們也在儘量根據現實來謀應付辦法是：（一）使用現有可資移動而無人居住的暫時的房屋，（二）使用荒廢而建築尙好的住宅，（三）將大住宅，工商機關房屋改裝。我們也要照着現實的環境，共同應付目前的困難，二房東與三房客，應該和衷共濟，不能處於敵對的地位。</p>
<p>在現在的世界上，一個國家，決不能脫離其他國家而獨自生存，各個家庭也不能再『各人自掃門前雪』而應該互相合作了。</p>

<h3>憂鬰</h3>
<p>— 溯因</p>
<p>在一間三面有窗的病院房間裏，靠南窗的病床上靜悄悄地躺着一個女孩子，她的面容黯淡，雙眉輕鎖，雖是一個初成熱的少女，却失去了少女固有的丰韻。她一雙憂樊的眸子正在凝視着西窗外遠屬一排浴於秋陽殘輝中的樹梢發怔。</p>
<p>「怎麼今天早上兪醫生不來呢？我有話要說，他偏偏不來了。此刻是五點鎭了吧，劉醫生也許就要來了，眼他說吧。」</p>
<p>棋下一陣說話聲，接着是樓梯上急促和沉重的步履聲，她心裏惴着，她連忙整了一整衣襟和散亂的頭髮，這時，院長劉醫生魁梧的影子已在她眼前出現了。</p>
<p>「劉醫生好！」</p>
<p>劉醫生站在門檻外，點了點頭，「沈小姐你好着嗎？」</p>
<p>往日，她總是照例回答；「好的」，可是今天她却躊躇着，她不能說「好」，可是也不能說「不好」。她看劉醫生的神情好像今天是格外的匆忙，連房間裹也不路進來，她幾乎想把預備說的話不說，「開天說吧。」但劉醫生看見她這副躊躇的神情，便舉步跨了進來。後面的護士林小姐也跟踵進來，走到她牀邊想把她足邊的縐做一團的毯子拉拉平直，但沈小姐却把足部的毯子拉了開來。</p>
<p>「劉醫生，請你給我看看這隻右足，昨天媽來給我揩足發覺這隻足的小腿運膝部都浮腫了呢！」</p>
<p>劉醫生從容地　下腰來按揑了一會她的腿膝，又望了一望她的面容，「這不是腫，是肥胖呢！你的面寵不是也胖了嗎？」</p>
<p>「哦，不見得吧！媽說這隻左足就細瘦。」</p>
<p>劉醫生把她左足也按揑着比較了一下，「差不多。」接着他轉首對林小姐說：「騐騐小便看。」一面順手把毯子蓋好了沈小姐的足，對她說了一句「沒有什麼，別擔心。」便匆匆地走了出去。她望着劉醫生的背影，滿腹狐疑。</p>
<p>早上九點鐘，副院長兪醫生照例巡視各病房。當他和議士朱小姐走進沈小姐的房間裏時，發覺了沈小姐眉宇間蘊藏着深重的憂　而對她注視着。</p>
<p>『兪醫生早！你昨天怎麼沒有來？』</p>
<p>『到杭州去出診。你可有甚麼事情嗎？』</p>
<p>她臉兒一紅，囁嚅着說：『昨天劉醫生關照驗小便，剛巧……剛巧月經來，不知可不可以騐？』</p>
<p>站在旁邊的朱小姐一聽到她的話，突然舉手掩鼻，奪門而出。她窘得無地自容，本來蒼白的臉兒現在像天半朱誼。她宭急地的說：</p>
<p>『我問過林小姐可不可以驗，她說不知道，叫我問你。』</p>
<p>『不能騐。爲甚麼要騐小便呢？』兪醫生平靜地的問。</p>
<p>『爲了腿腫。』她的侷促稱减，揭開足部的毯子。</p>
<p>兪醫生捻揑和審視了一下她的腿部，『並不腫。』</p>
<p>『哦？』她舉起頭和脖子來想自己來看看腿部，可是兪醫生一手把她身體按住了。「別動！動了要動壞背脊骨的。」</p>
<p>道時，朱小姐走回了房間裏，還對兪醫生扮了一個鬼臉，『怪難爲情的！』窘得她差一點哭了出來。幸虧兪醫生轉背走了，朱小姐也隨着出去。</p>
<p>月光從玻璃窗裏照進，射在狀上，地上，反映得滿室幽明。</p>
<p>『啊！今天不是陰歷十月半了麼？怎麼這回月經還不來呢？前次是八月底前幾天來的，已愆期半個多月了。以前雖也愆期，但至多差十天八天。我也許生了『乾血癆』，樓下十五號房間裏的鄒小姐不是說也生的『乾血癆』嗎？住院已四個月，病還沒有好。聽說這病是纏綿難愈的，要是我也生了這種病，那可糟了，這脊骨痛病更不會好了。吹！』一陣恐懼壓上她的心頭。</p>
<p>『媽來時問間她吧？……不，不能讓她知道的，給她知道了她更有理由要我回家去了。一回了家，她一定不許我再這樣靜臥着的了，因爲她說腿博是平臥太久的結果。但醫生却說我的『脊骨癆』不是這樣靜臥着，是很危險的。唉，究竟應該怎麼辦呢？』惶恐，悲哀，迷惑種種的情緒一齊困圍着她的心。</p>
<p>「還是問問醫生吧，到底懲柑這些日子是不是生了『乾血癆。」』可是羞愧的感覺立刻排開了惶恐悲哀，迷惑種種情緒而獨據了她的心。一個半月前朱小姐掩鼻疾走的印象，突破了她强力的意識的壓抑，重新浮現在腦際，她竭力掙扎掉那難堪的印象的窘迫，『問問又有甚麼用處呢？他們總是會說不是的　像腿腫那樣。』</p>
<p>她跌進了憂　的深淵，她由懷疑而確信她是患了『乾血癆』了。</p>
<p>常識</p>
<h3>今年星期計算法</h3>
<p>— 彭竇</p>
<p>你要知道二十五年中，那一天是星期幾嗎？這裏吿訴你一個法子，非常準確。</p>
<p>法則：一月加一，二月加四，三月加四，四月加〇，五月加二，六月加五，七月加〇，八月加三，九月加六，十月加一，十一月加四，十二月加十六。</p>
<p>公式：日期加加數以七除，除不盡的餘數就是星期幾，除盡了就是星期日。</p>
<p>例如：三月十四日星期幾？八月二十五日星期幾？</p>
<p>說明：三月十四日，依照公式，十四加四，以七除，還剩四，就是星期四</p>
<p>八月二十五日，依照公式二十五加三以七除，剛巧除盡，所以是星期日。</p>
<p>隨筆</p>
<h3>「肖」的兒子</h3>
<p>— 自芳</p>
<p>因爲古書上有過這麼一句話：『堯之子，丹朱不肯』，因此後世對人子不上進，不學好的都叫做『不肖』。這兩字含義的不合情理，不合邏輯，凡是稍且常識的人都會感覺到的。你想：凡是兒子不好的都是不肖父親的，那末，舉世爲父的人都是唐堯無疑了。毋怪宋儒羅仲素說：『天下無不是的父母』，這句話可說是『不肖』兩字的註脚。假使一定說道是顚撲不破的眞理，那麼凡是不學好的兒子祗要給他娶妻生子，馬上就變做聖賢人了，那眞是『易如反掌』，何樂而不爲？</p>
<p>無如在事實上，儘有許多子女繞膝的人也被認爲『不肖的」，那末，這『不肖』的兒子的兒子視他的老子是否也是『是』的？比方某甲對他的老子忤逆不孝，那末依據『天下無不是的父母』道一鐵律，某甲的兒子對於他老子忤逆祖父的行爲該認爲是不錯的，更常進一步效法老子的『懿行』。如果這採，那麼某甲該說他的兒子是『肖』的，而欣然忍受他的忤逆行爲了吧？</p>

<p>[Report from This Newspaper, Chongqing, 20th] Schools in the Shapingba and Ciqikou districts of Chongqing are deeply concerned about the increasingly serious situation in the Northeast. They have held meetings for several days to brew a second patriotic demonstration. Slogans and wall newspapers are posted everywhere, with prominent slogans such as "Oppose the government's weak diplomacy," "The Communist Party is selling out the motherland," "National interests are above all else," "Report traitors and spies," and "Oppose secret diplomacy." Those who usually openly show their radical tendencies have mostly disappeared and dare not show their faces in front of the masses again.</p>
<h3>Content of Sino-French New Treaty Negotiations; Foreign Minister Wang Will Go to Paris to Sign It Early</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 20th] Well-informed sources expect that once Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie arrives in Paris, the new Sino-French treaty can be signed early, and the withdrawal of Chinese troops from northern Vietnam can be realized with the establishment of the treaty. Other issues still under discussion include: (1) extraterritoriality, with the French believing that they should retain their extraterritorial rights in China before the treaty is established; (2) the property rights of the French Catholic Church in China; (3) the establishment of a free port in Haiphong; (4) the transfer of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to China; and (5) the occupation fees for Chinese troops stationed in Vietnam. Regarding the negotiations between the Viet Minh and the French authorities, all parties are still maintaining silence. It is reported that the French cabinet discussed the matter yesterday, and Colonial Minister Moutet reviewed the situation in Vietnam.</p>
<h3>The Soviets Still Control Transportation Lines in the Northeast; Zhang Jiaao Postpones Departure from Chongqing; Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai Confer in Yan'an</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper, Chongqing, 20th] It is reported that the transportation lines in various parts of the Northeast are currently still under the management of the Soviet army. In important cities in the Northeast, the Soviet army has dispatched military transportation special commissioners to specifically manage railway transportation and other matters.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 20th] Zhang Jiaao, chairman of the Economic Committee of the Northeast Headquarters, previously returned to Chongqing to report to the highest authorities and ask for instructions on everything. He was originally scheduled to fly to Peiping on a special plane on the morning of the 20th, but he was unable to do so due to some reason and will stay here for a few more days.</p>
<h3>Marshall Will Remain in China; Plan for U.S. Military Advisory Group Completed</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] U.S. Special Envoy to China Marshal Marshall will remain in China until his mission is completed. Lieutenant General Gillem, of the War Department, whereas Marshall represents President Truman and the State Department. Marshal Marshall is now preparing to depart for various parts of China for inspection.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] It was learned today from authoritative sources that the plan for the U.S. Military Advisory Group in China has been completed and has been approved by the highest military and political leaders. It is now only awaiting final approval from President Truman.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 19th] Zhou Enlai has also flown back to Yan'an to confer with Mao Zedong. At the same time, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie consulted with Chairman Chiang in Nanjing yesterday after returning to Chongqing and then discussed matters with Chiang Ching-kuo and Zhang Jiaao. With all parties rushing around frequently, it can be seen that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are once again vying for control of the Northeast.</p>
<p>[United Press, Yan'an, 19th] Zhou Enlai returned here today to meet with Mao Zedong. Zhou was unwilling to comment on the mission of this trip, perhaps to discuss the situation in the Northeast. It is reported that the Chinese Communist Party requested negotiations with the government a week ago on the issue of local autonomy in the Northeast and recognition and reorganization of the 300,000 troops in the Northeast. It is said that Zhou Enlai will stay overnight and return to Chongqing tomorrow.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] Secretary of State Byrnes told the press today that the State Department has not yet obtained proof of the Soviet army's withdrawal from the Northeast. He said that the United States has asked China and the Soviet Union to notify Washington of the progress of negotiations regarding the Northeast, but the Chinese and Soviet governments have not yet replied. Secretary of State Byrnes expressed the hope that the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission in Korea could begin work in early March to deal with various economic and administrative issues. Regarding the division of Korea north and south at the 38th parallel, progress is only expected after the commission begins work. He also revealed that Acheson decided to return to Japan to assist General MacArthur with political issues.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 19th, United Press] The New York Herald Tribune commented that the current situation in Northeast China disappoints those who hope that the United States and the Soviet Union will maintain good relations. The recent future development of the area will be a touchstone for the United States and the Soviet Union to establish friendly relations. Such a test may be a good thing. This test will give a clearer indication than the current facts as to whether the international cooperation agreed upon earlier for the Northeast region of Asia is a fact or merely high-sounding and meaningless words.</p>
<h3>This Year's National Defense Plan Decided; Implementing the Construction of the Air Force and Navy; Army Generals Leave Beijing and Return to Their Posts</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Chongqing News: The decision of the military demobilization conference, this "elite soldiers policy," is not limited to the army. It is heard that this year's long-deliberated national defense plan also has timely decisions suitable for refining the air force and rebuilding the navy. In the future, the Chinese Air Force and the Navy's Qingdao. Judging from the measures currently taken by the government, the construction creed of the Chinese Air Force and Navy in the future will obviously emphasize quality over quantity. The fact that the Navy only sets up one place and does not mention setting up a department for the time being, and the air force units are becoming less and less, also illustrates that today, not only all construction of the Navy and Air Force of China must emphasize quality over quantity, but the same is true of the institutions themselves.</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] One-fifth of the generals who attended the military demobilization conference returned to their posts this morning. The generals remaining in Beijing visited the 74th Army stationed in the Beijing-Tianjin area to see field exercises today. At 7:00 PM, the Army Headquarters held an evening party at the Lizhi Society and performed Peking opera and plays. Although the program was wonderful, the participants were not very enthusiastic. It is said that although the generals had a big conference, the landscape was still full of scars and they could not bear to enjoy themselves. They were eager to return to their defenses. It is heard that a large number of generals will return to their posts tomorrow afternoon, and Mei Lanfang has cancelled his trip to Beijing.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the meeting stated that the troop reorganization plan decided that a large number of senior generals would retire, and the important resolutions of the meeting were as follows: (1) establish combat troops to replace the existing army corps; (2) reduce the army to ninety divisions; (3) most army commanders would be reassigned as division commanders; (4) improve the equipment of the army to enhance the strength of each division; (5) replenish the strength of the regiments; (6) each division would be incorporated a regiment of artillery.</p>
<h3>Increasing Obstacles to Road Repair Work; Encountering Serious Tests; Communist Troops Busy Moving in Shandong Province</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th, Urgent Telegram] News from transportation circles indicates that road repair work is now encountering serious tests. Although the equipment, materials, and manpower to be used to repair the Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways have arrived at the work sections one after another, it is difficult to predict when the work will begin. According to engineering personnel who returned from supervising the repair of the railway north of Xuzhou, the obstacles to road repair have increased in the past three days, and it is heard that the Communist troops in Shandong Province are very busy moving, which seems to be related to the situation in the Northeast. Moreover, according to well-informed sources, if the repair work cannot proceed unhindered within the next five days, this matter may become a pie in the sky. The obstructors within the Lunan Military Region of the Communist Army are currently very interested in purchasing grain, and all other matters are dismissed as unknown.</p>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 20th] According to today's Chinese newspapers, the National Army and the Communist Army clashed about five miles from Hedingnan on the Pinghan Railway. Chinese sources also said that there was also contact in Anyang in northern Henan. The Railway Supervision Team is scheduled to leave here today for Anyang to supervise the railway repair work in that province. It was learned here today that approximately 450,000 catties of rice and sweet potatoes have arrived in Taian, Shandong Province, and will be distributed immediately under the guidance of the Food Committee of the joint National-Communist-U.S. commission.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Suspects Accused of Rebellion Are Tried</h3>

This proposal was approved and will be implemented at the provincial government meeting on the 19th.</p>
<h3>Li Liejun Dies in Chongqing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 20th] Li Liejun, a veteran of the revolution and member of the Central Supervisory Committee, had suffered from high blood pressure. Since the beginning of spring, the old ailment has worsened rapidly. Medical treatment was ineffective, and he passed away in Chongqing at 10:20 PM on the 20th at the age of sixty-five.</p>
<h3>Special Commentary: The Opening of Door Households and the Current Chinese Balance of Power</h3>
<p>— Shi Zhigang</p>
<p>I. The Decline of a Strong Nation's Mission</p>
<p>Domestically, although political consultation has been declared successful, the hope of political parties cooperating in construction remains faint. Political instability leads to economic and social collapse. No measure can satisfy the people, and the authorities already feel overwhelmed. The clamor for democracy only increases disorder and does not promote real progress. Internal contradictions prevent China from following in the footsteps of Britain and the Soviet Union and immediately embarking on the road to revival. The attention of the entire nation is focused on the stability of domestic order, somewhat weakening attention to the infiltration of external forces. Amid the ebb and flow of international power, China has passively become the focus of world problems again. Although this victory has created a once-in-a-millennium opportunity for us, this opportunity is about to be "missed." To put it urgently, China is about to step into the position of a semi-colony again. Of course, China is one of the four powers in the United Nations, but China's ability to become a strong nation in victory is a "shameful victory." How is this so?</p>
<p>First, China won the war but lost sovereignty over Outer Mongolia. Although this is in line with the principles of nationalism and the Atlantic Charter's self-determination of nations, why must the Soviet Union and we conclude an alliance treaty stipulating this only today, after the victory? Among the victorious countries in World War II, only Poland and our country lost territory. What position do we place ourselves in? Second, allied countries have troops stationed in China. Although China is one of the four powers, it is too much like Iran and Greece in many ways. We relied on others to win the war, so other people's troops can be stationed in our country to assist in the surrender or delay withdrawal. Especially in the Northeast, the Soviet army repeatedly postponed its withdrawal. In this situation, what is the difference between the Russian army's unwillingness to withdraw after China's defeat in the Boxer Rebellion? Furthermore, Japan was defeated and therefore must be monitored and interfered with by foreign countries. However, in our victorious country, there is also a disguised struggle for rights and interests, allowing others to handle it. Although the names are different, it is actually the same as a defeated country. How can this be explained?</p>
<p>Not only the United States and the Soviet Union, whose national strength has expanded particularly after the war, are actively extending their influence to our country, but even the two imperialist countries, Britain and France, whose situation is as "miserable" as ours, are also intentionally or unintentionally attempting to restore their original appearance, fantasizing about prolonging their dim-witted dreams in this awakened land. The Kowloon Ping Shan Airport incident, the Shanghai Bairding incident, and the anti-Chinese tragedies performed in Malaya and Siam are enough to illustrate our judgment.</p>
<p>We can open the window from this chaotic house and look out at the world. The world outside China has clearly formed three divisions after this war – the newly emerging capitalist United States, the socialist Soviet Union, and the group of declining imperialist countries such as Britain and France. They are each relying on their own systems and forms, attempting to actively expand their influence and extend it as far as possible to any corner of the world. China may become an independent entity outside the three spheres of influence, or it may be absorbed by any one of them. This is the largest arena of competition. This is a re-enactment of the Warring States period in history.</p>
<p>This is a huge crisis. In the arena of national competition, our own strength is too weak, and our attention is focused on long-pending domestic problems. If we must start with clarifying internal rights and then extend to the world, then perhaps Korea will no longer be independent, Vietnam will fail to achieve autonomy, the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia will be almost completely excluded, and our own fate will have been "predetermined" by others.</p>
<p>In short, if everyone does not awaken and we remain in a dominated position, the fleeting "strong nation" destiny will inevitably decline!</p>
<p>II. The Extension of Soviet Influence to the East</p>
<p>埃, 里务 (Emery Reves) in his book "The Anatomy of Peace" once said this:</p>
<p>"The development path of Soviet foreign policy is exactly the same as that of other strong countries – alliances, spheres of influence, expediency and compromise when power is exhausted, and expansion after military victory. Communism is only a means for the Soviet Union to achieve this goal – a great nationalist goal...</p>
<p>After 1920, communism gradually decreased in importance, while nationalism continued to increase. In the early twenty-five years, although the Communist International was very ambitious, its influence failed to extend far beyond its borders. However, the totalitarian Soviet national state followed. Even the Communist parties in foreign countries, which were indeed encouraged by Moscow, have set aside their struggle to socialize their own countries and gradually become tools of Soviet nationalist policy. Their attitude is not based on the need to establish communism, but on the need to enhance the international position of the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>Interpreted in this way, why is there an Eastern European country group? Why does Turkey want to reaffirm its position? Why does Iran want to request UN mediation? All are obvious.</p>
<p>This turmoil and disturbance is not only seen in the neighboring countries on the western border of the Soviet Union, but also in China, the eastern neighbor of the Soviet Union. In addition to the matters stipulated in last year's Sino-Soviet Alliance Treaty, the shadow of the Soviet Union is flashing all over our Northeast and Northwest. Approximately as follows:</p>
<p>1. The Yining Incident: After the Kazakh national riots last year, the Chongqing government sent personnel to pacify and negotiate, allowing a high degree of autonomy. Recently, there have been rumors that the "East Turkestan Republic" is stirring up trouble again.</p>
<p>2. The Outer Mongolian Tangnu Ulianghai region was incorporated into the Soviet Union and renamed "Tannu Tuva Province," which was not decided by a referendum of Outer Mongolian citizens.</p>
<p>3. Autonomous regimes have emerged in Inner Mongolia and the Xing'an Mountains area of the Northeast.</p>
<p>4. There are new economic negotiations on the Northeast issue.</p>
<p>The above are all based on recent reports, and the so-called legal treaty provisions are still outside. These include—</p>
<p>1. In the Sino-Soviet Agreement, China recognizes the independence of Outer Mongolia. China and the Soviet Union jointly manage the Chinese Changchun Railway, and the Lushun Military Port is jointly used by China and the Soviet Union and defended by the Soviet Union. Dalian becomes a free city.</p>
<p>2. In the Yalta Agreement, in addition to the Chinese side, the Soviet Union also occupies the Kuril Islands and Southern Sakhalin.</p>
<p>3. According to the UN decision, Korea is under trusteeship for five years. Soviet troops are stationed in northern Korea. In summary, the Soviet Union's gains in East Asia have been quite substantial. No wonder the Americans are jealous, pointing out that the Soviet Union has restored the rights of the Tsarist era.</p>
<p>According to unconfirmed news, the Soviet Union has even demanded to demarcate the area along the Chinese Changchun Railway as a "security corridor." At the same time, the Jinzhou Northeast Headquarters will be established. It seems that Liaodong will become the division between the two major forces of China and the Soviet Union. If this trend cannot be reversed, what is the difference between this and the inability to recover the Sixteen Prefectures of Yanyun after the Liao Dynasty was destroyed in the Five Dynasties period?</p>
<p>We can prove from this point that what 埃. 里务 said does have its reasons.</p>
<p>We cannot solely blame the British and Americans for the betrayal policy in the Altai Agreement. The Soviet Union can demand the restoration of the rights of the Tsarist era, so why can't we, who are also a victorious country, restore all the rights we lost before the Qing Dynasty? In short, "weak countries have no diplomacy" is a fact. Taking a step back, if we compare the gains and losses of China in this war with those of Turkey in the Crimean War or Italy in World War I, then it may not be possible to comfort ourselves with "better than nothing."</p>
<p>Regarding the current situation in the Northeast, as the Americans say, it is as thorny as the Shandong issue after World War I. The Soviet Union is too much like Japan. The Soviet Union has completely and flawlessly inherited Tsarist Russia. Let's see how Tsarist Russia treated China. It always received some unearned gains whenever China could. During the Anglo-French War, the Qing Emperor fled Beijing and formed a humiliating alliance with Britain and France; the Russian envoy Igniatiev mediated peace, and as a result, Russia obtained the land of the Sixty-Four Villages East of the River. During the Shaanxi-Gansu Hui Rebellion, Russia even came forward to negotiate, and as a result, China lost the area along the lower reaches of the Ili River. In the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, China ceded the Liaodong Peninsula, which was intervened and recovered by Russia, Germany, and France. As a result, the Sino-Russian secret treaty was established, creating the historical basis for the various conditions of this Sino-Soviet military alliance agreement. Although the Soviet Union once solemnly declared its abandonment, it went back on its word in the Yalta Agreement and demanded inheritance! At that time, Tsarist Russia even encouraged Germany and France to occupy Jiaozhou and Guangzhou Bay respectively, forming a crisis in which the Qing Dynasty was almost divided by the great powers. During the Xinhai Revolution, Russia instigated the independence of Outer Mongolia's Zhangjia Hutuktu. There are countless examples of this.</p>
<p>In this Sino-Soviet military alliance agreement, the two signatory countries, China and the Soviet Union, are the cornerstones of the stable democratic camp. This agreement is sufficient to ensure the stability of the Pacific West Coast order; its contribution is great, and there is no need for much speculation. However, speculating from the recent rumors of new negotiations makes people increasingly reminiscent of the past history and have a cautious feeling.</p>
<p>Furthermore, try to observe the history of Japanese aggression against China since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, such as: encouraging ethnic minorities, creating vassal regimes, actively plotting division; massacring responsible personnel (such as martyr Cai Gongshi), disregarding Chinese sovereignty; and raising remnants of the fallen Qing Dynasty, harboring evil intentions, etc. There are so many tricks that it is difficult to hide them from the world. The Japanese bandits made every effort to weaken China and facilitate their own expansion, which is indeed the act of an aggressor. After this war, the aggressive forces have been almost completely eliminated. We hope that any country can take Japan as a lesson and no longer fantasize about infringing upon the sovereignty of the Republic of China. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Secrets of Atomic Bomb Manufacturing Still Held in American Hands Canada Decides to Purge Domestic Traitors Investigation of Espionage Cases Continues, Suspects Arrested</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 19th] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes told the press today: The secret knowledge of manufacturing atomic bombs is still being kept by the U.S. government. This secret has not been detected by any international spies in Canada. Regarding the atomic bomb information shared by the U.S., Britain, and Canada, Byrnes made another formal statement, stating that neither the British nor Canadian governments know the secrets of atomic bomb manufacturing, let alone other countries. He claimed that the Canadian spy case elements did not deploy in the United States, and no U.S. citizens are involved in the case. He also claimed that he has no reason to arrest any suspects in the U.S. He does not believe that Major General Groves, director of the atomic bomb laboratory, ever said that some secrets of the atomic bomb had been leaked. Byrnes said that he had recently met with Groves, and Groves never said such a thing. If it is as rumored that Soviet secret personnel stole a suitcase full of espionage case documents and were able to leave the U.S. port, he would be very surprised.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 19th] Today's "Toronto Star" reported that Canada will require all Soviet agents related to espionage to leave Canada. "Canada will insist on a total cleansing of the personnel of the Soviet Embassy and demand that measures be taken to ensure that the movement to detect Canada's military and scientific secrets does not happen again." Montreal magazine today accused the Soviet Union, "The Soviet Union's plan to dump 125,000 pounds worth of black market uranium on the Canadian market has been discovered."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Ottawa, 20th] The case of leaking atomic bomb secrets is still shrouded in mystery. The cabinet met yesterday, but no statement was issued afterwards. According to the authorities, the government's primary goal is to purge domestic traitors. It is said that there are more than a dozen major traitors among the arrested suspects, some of whom are engaged in fraud, and a few are professional spies.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Ottawa, 20th] The Canadian government announced today that regarding the "atomic espionage network," the government is prepared to issue further announcements to clarify indiscriminate rumors. The cabinet is quite uneasy about the worldwide attention to this case and the outside world's unfounded suspicions, and is eager to pay attention to government officials suspected of leaking secrets, knowing that some of them hold extremely high positions.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London, 19th] According to today's Star Evening News, the intelligence department of the British Army Ministry is conducting an investigation into the Canadian atomic secret leak case and is currently conducting searches in the London area and the southern counties where Canadian troops are stationed.</p>
<h3>Limited Number of Visitors to US Atomic Bomb Test About 200 Reporters</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington, 20th] Secretary of State Byrnes said at a press conference yesterday: When the US Navy conducts atomic bomb tests in May and June, the only foreigners allowed to visit will be representatives of the UN Atomic Energy Commission. The representatives of the committee include China, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Canada, Australia, Egypt, the Netherlands, and Mexico in addition to the United States.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Chicago, 20th] Navy Public Information Director Miller told the Inland Daily Newspaper Association that the atomic bomb test in the Pacific may be broadcast to the world like a play, and about 200 newspaper reporters will be allowed to visit the experiment on ships 8 to 10 miles away. There are 19 ships used as targets and 150 ships around the perimeter.</p>
<h3>UK Officials' Mission to India is Important, Seeking Solutions from Indians to Open the Way for India's Constitutional Government</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 20th] Three key members of the British cabinet are scheduled to fly to India at the end of next month to make the greatest efforts to open up constitutional solutions. A government spokesman said that the success of this mission is of great importance not only to India and the British Commonwealth, but also to world peace. The three cabinet members are Secretary of State for India Lawrence, Secretary of Commerce Cripps, and Secretary of the Navy Alexander. According to Lawrence, this proposal has been fully agreed to by Indian Governor Wavell, and the future of 400 million people will be determined by this. The three ministers have broad powers for this trip and will actually represent the British cabinet in India. Their research matters are not limited to Cripps' proposals, but will seek the best way to deal with the situation from the Indians themselves. The most important thing is to establish a constitutional body. Britain recognizes that constitutionalism is the task of the Indians themselves, and Britain only intends to assist them in reaching a consensus. The time the delegation stays in India is not limited, and the negotiation situation will depend on the local environment. They will listen to the opinions of all parties in India as much as possible, and do not carry specific suggestions on this trip. They can only decide on a plan that is most suitable for India after referring to the opinions of the Indians.</p>

<h3>MacArthur Promotes Anti-Drug Work in Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 20th] US government drug experts said today that they believe MacArthur's anti-drug campaign in Japan is the "most significant development" in international anti-drug work and hope that this measure can stimulate China and other opium-producing regions to ban opium. These experts pointed out that the recent burning of opium in China indicates that the Chinese government is determined to ban drugs. An official said that Japan used to produce 15 to 20 tons of opium annually, and in addition, according to a 1943 estimate, Korea also produced 35 to 40 tons of opium annually.</p>

<h3>Another Example of Nazi Atrocities Soap Made from Human Fat</h3>
<p>Institutes specially designed for this were quite interested!</p>
<p>[Associated Press Nuremberg, 19th] Soviet prosecutors announced in the international court today the details of how Nazi Germans extracted oil from the bodies of victims in a special factory in Danzig and made soap. When a German assistant testified that he had helped boil the bodies and used the soap, many people turned pale. The assistant said that in the summer of 1943, a building was completed in the Danzig Anatomy Institute, named "Human Skeletal Product Experiment Institute." In January of the following year, it began to make soap from human fat. The human raw materials were supplied by a mental hospital, which routinely terminated the lives of those who were physically and mentally unsound. Later, 400 headless corpses were obtained from the Konigsberg prison. The Nazis had a guillotine in the prison. Nazi officials and scientists were very interested in this soap-making experiment, and many people went to the experimental institute to visit. Dr. Conti, who once served as the Nazi Minister of Health, was one of them. Conti has committed suicide in Nuremberg. The assistant also confessed that he had personally boiled the oil from 40 male and female corpses, obtaining 7,280 kilograms, and had used as much as 4 kilograms of this human fat soap for cosmetics and washing.</p>

<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Military Officer Executed for Collaborating with Thieves and Stealing Weapons</p>
<p>Ji Yaozhou, an attached platoon leader of the Third Platoon, First Company, Tianyi Regiment, Eighty-seventh Division, Seventy-first Army, stated that in August of last year, while stationed in Liuzhou, Guangxi, he colluded with local merchants and residents to steal bolt-action submachine guns and ammunition, selling them to a Mr. Mo in Dongquan Township, Liuzhou. The matter was discovered by the company, and he was transferred to the military headquarters. Subsequently, the military headquarters received orders from Suzhou, and the soldier was escorted to Suzhou along with the army. The military headquarters, considering that the soldier dared to steal and sell weapons and ammunition during wartime, violating Article 2, Section 3 of the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Corruption, submitted the case to the Garrison Headquarters of the Beijing-Shanghai Area, which approved his execution by firing squad yesterday.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>

<p>Changzhou</p>
<p>Drug Trafficking Fugitive Arrested and Sent to Beijing</p>
<p>Izo Sakubei, 30 years old, from Niigata Prefecture, Japan, previously came to China with the invading Japanese army and had been here for five or six years. He served as the captain of the enemy police guard team in Wutang, Changzhou. In addition to wantonly harming our compatriots, he colluded with Chinese traitors and vagrants to sell opium, heroin, and other drugs on a large scale. After his military service expired, he was reassigned as a ticket inspector on inland riverboats. Using his brutal methods, he mistreated passengers, accumulating a large sum of money, which he lent to civilians at high interest rates. In August of last year, when the Japanese surrendered, Izo Sakubei, because of his fluency in Chinese, was able to hide more easily and was not discovered and sent to a concentration camp. However, his loans became uncollectible, and he gradually became impoverished. He gave three privately hidden handguns to a Mr. Jia in Wutang, allowing him to hide in the countryside for a long time. Recently, Mr. Jia, fearing that the fugitive's whereabouts would be exposed and implicate him, transported him by boat to the countryside of Liyang. He was eventually discovered by the Changzhou garrison and arrested, and evidence of his crimes was collected and sent to Beijing for investigation.</p>

<h3>Investigation of Household Registration in the City - Mobilizing Over 26,000 People</h3>
<p>Estimated Expenses Exceed 10 Million Yuan - If Not Completed Within a Week, It May Be Extended</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau began investigating household registration throughout the city some days ago and originally planned to complete the task within a week. It has been learned that, to facilitate procedures for citizens, the effort may be extended by one or two days. The investigation will result in precise and detailed statistics. Currently, approximately 70 people are being trained to carry out this work, and the results are expected to be published in early March. This investigation involves the mobilization of over 26,000 people each day, with an estimated cost exceeding 10 million yuan. According to officials from the Civil Affairs Bureau yesterday, the investigation has been proceeding smoothly. However, there have been some misunderstandings regarding this effort. The Baobaojia system was promulgated in our country in the 18th year of the Republic of China. The enemy and puppets stole our inherent good system to carry out their governing agenda and plunder the people's food and private property. Therefore, the nature is fundamentally different. Moreover, investigating household registration is necessary for any country, whether for educational, economic, or social reasons. It is hoped that citizens will understand the true meaning and cooperate with the government.</p>
<h3>High Court Held Hearing Yesterday - Interrogation of Former Puppet Prison Warden - Lei Midi Di, Si Xue Er Fa and Xi Bao Xiong and Three Other Criminals Summoned on the Same Day</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The former puppet Shanghai Prison Warden, Shen Guanquan, transferred 850 prisoners from the prison to Zhoushan Islands and other places to assist the enemy in constructing defensive fortifications. Due to the unbearable torture, 60 to 70 of these prisoners died one after another. Those who survived were mostly unrecognizable. During his tenure, Shen also stole and sold a large number of paper, white cloth, scrap copper, gray felt, and other items stored in the prison, which were worth tens of millions of yuan in puppet currency at the time. After the victory, he was reported by Chen Weifan, a senior official who had left the prison. After an investigation by the High Procuratorate, he was prosecuted by the High Court in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 1, Sections 1 and 4 of the Regulations for Punishing Traitors. Several other people were also implicated, including Xu Quanyuan, the head of the prison's work section; Shen Guanrong, the deputy head of the work section; and Zhang Xuemei, the deputy head of the general affairs section. Shen and Zhang are currently on the run, Xu has been released on bail, and Shen Guanquan is in custody. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Cao interrogated Shen Guanquan in the criminal court of the Tilanqiao High Court. Shen Guanquan stated that the Japanese initially requested the transfer of 1,200 prisoners, with orders from the puppet Shanghai Municipal Government and the puppet Shanghai High Court Procuratorate. The Japanese also sent trucks to force the loading of prisoners, so there was no way to refuse. In the end, a total of 850 people were transported. As for the sale of items, it was due to a lack of funds and was approved by Wu Songbi, the Minister of Puppet Judicial Administration at the time. The proceeds that were not accounted for were used to provide for underground workers and political prisoners imprisoned in the prison and to provide them with travel expenses after their release. In addition, they were used to establish an obligation school, so he was also an underground worker. Subsequently, the court interrogated Xu Quanyuan. The lawyer hired by the defendant presented various pieces of evidence and requested that the court summon Ai Guofan and Wan Molin, and five others who were responsible for underground work in Shanghai at the time, to testify. The court ruled that the court would deliberate and decide. The accuser, Chen Weifan, was absent. The case was adjourned for further hearing. Shen Guanquan was returned to custody.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Judge Cai also interrogated the Portuguese national Lei Midi Di, Si Xue Er Fa, and the Hungarian national Xi Bao Xiong, who were accused of purchasing a large amount of gasoline, alcohol, and other supplies for the enemy for military use. The defendants hired lawyer Tang Huaiqun to defend them. After investigation, the court ruled that the hearing be adjourned for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Continued Trial of War Criminals on the 18th - Decision to Extend the Formal Sentencing</h3>
<p>The Japanese Commander Continues to Feign Ignorance</p>
<p>The American Military Tribunal began trying eighteen Japanese war criminals at the beginning of this month and has now reached its third week. Originally, the formal sentencing was scheduled for yesterday, but because various testimonies and arguments have not been completed, the sentencing date will be changed to this Saturday. The defendant's defense lawyer, Hawkins, seems to be trying to absolve each offender of guilt or at least reduce their sentences, but the plaintiff's defense lawyer, Webster, is also striving to seek justice for the deceased. As a result, a war of words breaks out in the court from time to time, putting the five presiding judges in a difficult position. Hawkins cited two points in an attempt to win the case: (1) Each offender had to follow orders from superiors and act against their own will in order to fulfill their military duties. (2) To overturn each offender's original confession, so that they could shift the blame to others. Yesterday, the court successively summoned Major General Kabumoto Masao, Commander of the Japanese 34th Army; Colonel Fukumoto Kameji; and Major Sakai Sadaji to appear in court to extract confessions. These three people were extremely cunning, sometimes saying "I don't remember," sometimes saying "I don't know," and sometimes saying "I didn't do this." But judging from the appearances of the three, they were not confused or forgetful people. Yesterday morning, Lieutenant Colonel Hawkins asked Matsumoto Satoru, who had just arrived, about the importance of orders in the Japanese army during wartime. Matsumoto Satoru said that it was equal to the Emperor's order, because Hawkins wanted to reduce the guilt of each offender from the point of obeying orders. Then, Colonel Fukumoto Kameji, Commander of the Garrison in Hankou, was summoned. This man was 52 years old, with graying hair, and claimed that he did not agree with the parade and only dispatched the garrison to cooperate on orders. The reasons for dispatching the garrison to cooperate were threefold: (1) to protect American pilots, (2) to prevent them from escaping or committing suicide, and (3) military orders are like mountains and cannot be violated. At this time, Lieutenant Colonel Webster produced his confession and asked to explain the meaning of "punishment." Fukumoto firmly denied participating in the action and cited the words of Tadano Masayoshi, Commander of the 34th Army, and Hattori Moriji, Commander of the Garrison: "You don't have to worry, I will take care of everything." Asked if he knew that what he was doing violated international law and humanity, Fukumoto said, "I know, so I don't agree." At this point, the judge left the courtroom. Fukumoto Osamu was summoned again in the afternoon, and he still pretended to be confused, repeatedly shaking his head and saying, "I don't know." The judge then summoned Major Sakai Sadaji. Sakai Sadaji was 50 years old, came from a farming family, and had served in the army for 30 years. He had a wife, one son, and six daughters. It is said that after the murder of the American pilots occurred, he learned of the situation from a report from Lieutenant Izumi Takeshi (who is on the run). At the time, the Japanese army thought that they could use this parade opportunity to publicize it widely and falsely claim that the Japanese had shot down an American plane, and at the same time quell the anger of the people in Hankou. He had discussed this with Fukumoto Kameji at the time, and Fukumoto said that he was afraid there would be trouble, but since it was an order, he had to execute it, "I have no way to help it." Lieutenant Colonel Webster asked, "Did you send the person who participated in the killing of the American pilots?" He replied, "Yes, but I only designated one person and did not specify who to send." So Lieutenant Colonel Webster read out a part of his confession. The offender countered that the confession had some errors. Then, because of the difference in the meaning of the words "punishing war criminals" and "insulting war criminals," the translator had to spend half an hour looking up dictionaries. Sakai Sadaji also did not admit to signing the order paper. His confession was largely the same as the above two. Yesterday took five hours, but to no avail.</p>
<h3>China Tobacco Company - Three Factories Start Production</h3>
<p>Monthly Output of 5,000 Large Cases of Cigarettes</p>
<p>[Our Report] The China Tobacco Company, an enemy asset taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, has had its first, second, and third factories start production since resuming work on the 11th of last month. The three factories have a total of 65 cigarette machines, most of which are now in operation, and can produce 5,000 large cases of cigarettes per month. It is reported that there are no difficulties in obtaining raw materials at present. Recently, a large shipment of tobacco leaves is expected to arrive from Qingdao. All of the cigarette factories taken over by the Tobacco Group of the former Ministry of Economic Affairs, except for those that were auctioned off and returned to their owners, will be operated by the company. The company's organizational and operational charter has been drafted and is awaiting review and approval by the relevant authorities. The nature of the company is roughly similar to that of the China Textile Construction Company and the China Silk Company. The company's operating period is set for two years. When the deadline expires, the company will issue shares to facilitate the transfer to private operation. Currently, before the board of directors is formed, the position of general manager will be temporarily filled by Yang Xiren, designated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
<p>Chinese Tobacco Factories Preparing to Resume Work</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the local Chinese Tobacco Factory Association, a total of 65 Chinese tobacco factories in the city have registered as members. In reality, more than 30 factories are in production. Large factories such as Huacheng and Nanyang are preparing to resume work. Although the current stock of raw materials for cigarettes, such as tobacco leaves and paper wrappers, is still sufficient, the source is not yet fully smooth. Moreover, the ad valorem tax on cigarettes is a heavy burden, so it is hoped that Chinese tobacco factories will do their best to rely on their own efforts to strengthen the position of Chinese cigarettes.</p>

<h3>American Military Surplus Goods to be Accepted for Purchase by All Sectors</h3>
<p>United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is the Largest Customer</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] It is reported that the American Foreign Liquidation Commission's "Bidding and Commitment Program" for the handling of American military surplus goods is expected to be open to bids from municipal governments and other industrial and commercial enterprises within a month. The commission has received repeated inquiries from all sectors regarding the issue of surplus goods. Currently, the commission is actively categorizing surplus goods in the Pacific region, including Okinawa and Guam. However, it is still doubtful whether there are any surplus military supplies in East China and the Shanghai region.</p>
<p>Bidders in this city will still be given the opportunity to purchase surplus goods from various American military outposts in the Pacific region. The commission has already obtained one return flight and will soon obtain another to transport bidders to various locations to</p>
<p>Inspect the Surplus Goods on Site</p>
<p>to clarify the situation. It is reported that the commission is being very careful in selling surplus goods in this city. The background of each bidder and their relationships with all parties will be reviewed. The commission reserves the right to refuse to sell any surplus goods and stated that "the US government does not intend to engage in retail or wholesale business, nor does it intend to provide 'profiteers' with huge profits." The</p>
<p>Overall Goal</p>
<p>of handling American military surplus goods in China is to assist in relief and rehabilitation work. Therefore, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is the largest customer for American surplus goods. UNRRA has already obtained a large number of surplus goods, especially trucks and building materials. UNRRA will also absorb a large amount of American military surplus food. Currently, various sectors in this city are applying for various</p>
<p>Vehicles, Primarily</p>
<p>Jeeps. However, according to one observer, most of the bidders are merchants who intend to use these surplus goods as a substitute for imported goods from the United States. However, it is predicted that the bidders' hopes of obtaining surplus goods are slim. It is reported that the commission will</p>
<p>Categorize and Price</p>
<p>various surplus goods according to their location, type, and condition, and then publicly solicit bids. Within a certain period, tenderers are required to submit a tender together with a bid bond of 10%. All tenderers will be invited to attend the bid opening. Before accepting a bid, the commission will give comprehensive consideration to the bidder. For special reasons, even the person who bids the highest price may have their bid rejected. It has also been reported that a batch of surplus transport aircraft has recently been</p>
<p>Sold to UNRRA</p>
<p>, China National Aviation Corporation, and Central Air Transport Corporation. Currently, the commission divides bidders into three categories: UNRRA has the highest priority for certain major surplus goods, followed by the Chinese government. Bidders in this city are classified into the third category, "Others."</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Mobile Market Transactions Lead to Simultaneous Rebound in Gold and Paper Money. Document Folders and Coupons are Not Traded Publicly. Chinese Stocks are Quoted at a Premium.</h3>
<p>Due to the easing of credit yesterday, buying sentiment increased, and transactions moved to the Sichuan Road area due to inconveniences caused by authorities inspecting the Securities Exchange Building. Trading was conducted secretly. Early morning trading showed slight improvement, reaching 1.42 million. Trading was extremely difficult, and even small transactions were prone to fluctuations. The price once fell from 1.45 million to 1.40 million. However, the international situation stimulated sentiment, and the easing of credit further fueled buying activity. The afternoon closing rebounded to above 1.45 million, an increase of 50% compared to the previous close. Scattered buying continued in the afternoon, with bids rising to around 1.50 million, and the trend was quite firm. Ornaments were still not listed. Sycee silver was around 1600, and silver dollars were around 800 yuan. Interest rates continued to ease, with daily interest rates at 15% to 20%.</p>
<p>The price of US dollars followed the gold market's ups and downs, initially hovering around 2000 yuan. Hundred-dollar bills were refused for delivery, and buyers had difficulty obtaining chips. The price gradually strengthened from around 1980 yuan. As the gold market improved, the price above 2000 yuan became stable. The price finally rose to around 2050 yuan, an increase of 60 yuan compared to the previous close. Old Hong Kong dollars were quoted at 37 times the Shanghai dollar in Hong Kong, with a 79% exchange rate. There were fewer sellers than buyers at around 330 yuan. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were above 340 yuan, and new notes were between 80 and 85 yuan, all showing slight declines.</p>
<p>There were no gatherings for government bonds or Chinese and foreign stocks. Private transactions were conducted based on the actual needs of both parties. Initially, government bonds hovered around the previous closing price, but finally rebounded slightly. Chinese stocks were slightly higher than the previous closing price, with some matched trades. Foreign stocks were all offered at prices below the previous closing price, with few buyers and no sellers.</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales Improve</h3>
<p>The yarn market turned onto a smooth path yesterday as sales improved and purchasing was strong. 20-count Double Horse yarn once again exceeded the million-dollar mark, while Blue Phoenix and Golden Bridge also exceeded 900,000. Confidence was strengthened as a result, and the trend was quite stable.</p>
<h3>Scattered Transactions in Spot Cotton</h3>
<p>Spot cotton transactions were less active yesterday, likely due to tight credit and the Shanghai Textile Construction Company's sudden wait-and-see attitude. Transactions included over one hundred pieces of imported cotton, Midlin, and Fire Engine brand Zhoupu cottonseeds.</p>
<h3>Good Sales of Woolen Fabrics</h3>
<p>Woolen fabric transactions saw significant progress yesterday. Western clothing tailors from various districts in this city, as well as tailors from Nanjing and Hangzhou, had strong demand. Most transactions were for single pieces or boxes, as, under today's high prices, most only sought to match various colors. Only one or two out of ten could afford to purchase entire boxes or bolts of woolen fabric. It was also reported that the Shanghai Textile Construction Company had released a batch of woolen fabrics yesterday.</p>
<h3>Weak Cotton Cloth</h3>
<p>The cotton cloth market was quiet, and buyers remained hesitant. In addition, the China Textile Construction Company continued to supply and sell cotton cloth as a precursor to suppressing market prices, so the cloth market was unable to rise.</p>
<h3>Silk Market Initially Weak, Then Strong</h3>
<p>The silk market was stable. It opened slightly lower in the morning, but as factory costs had not decreased, traders bought on the cheap, and the market trend initially weakened but then strengthened. Meiya bed sheets opened at 1.09 million and were sold out, closing at 1.1 million bid. Dacheng Bi crepe rose from 3740 yuan to 3830 yuan. The afternoon trend was uniformly upward, and the silk market was firm. Based on current market prices, they were still insufficient to cover production costs, and the market generally expected higher prices.</p>
<h3>Hundreds of Boxes of Chinese Tea to be Shipped to the United States Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] It has been several years since the export of Chinese tea from this city ceased. Currently, there is strong demand in Europe and the United States. According to reporter investigations, recently, New York and other places plan to order several hundred tons of black tea, pearl tea, Gongxi tea, and other green teas from a tea merchant in this city. However, the tea merchant in this city, considering the depleted inventory in Shanghai and the fact that the new tea season is still far away, is finding it difficult to make a decision and remains hesitant. However, it is said that several hundred boxes will be shipped to the United States within days to meet the urgent overseas demand.</p>
<h3>Stable Trend in Black Tea</h3>
<p>The trend in black tea, which had been weakening for several days, has stabilized. This is partly because distress sales from small holders due to tight credit have become scarce, and large holders are maintaining prices. Therefore, although buying demand is small, the market atmosphere is still stable. The results are largely unchanged compared to the previous day. As for green tea, under the influence of concentrated demand, sentiment remains strong, and transaction prices for all goods are very optimistic.</p>
<h3>Reduced Supply, Strong Demand, Rice Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>The rice market is very active, with a limited supply and more demand than supply. Prices have risen by more than 2,000 yuan again. Flour has also increased by 300-600 yuan. Soybeans remain stable. The oil market is stable with a continued supply from Qingdao, and prices are temporarily unchanged. Soybean cakes have risen by 100-200 yuan, bran is strong, and raw peanuts have increased slightly.</p>
<h3>Lumber Sales are Robust</h3>
<p>The lumber market has been thriving recently, with robust sales to other ports and within this city. As a result, the price of foreign pine building materials is strong, and the price of Lauan plywood is also rising steadily. It is reported that small-scale plywood is being sold in this city, currently priced at 320 yuan per square foot, produced by Taichang.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Sugar prices have fallen due to the goods tax, making it difficult to transport goods.</p>
<p>Northern and Southern goods: Melon seeds remain strong, black dates are firm, and longan are declining rapidly.</p>
<p>Various brands of soap and Beautiful Phoenix matches are selling well and have risen in price. Wax candles are firm in price due to limited sales in northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>Cigarettes: Front Door cigarettes are selling well and are strong, while transactions in older brands of factory cigarettes are being negotiated downwards.</p>

<h3>New Women's "Re-Departure"!</h3>
<p>— Bao Shixi</p>
<p>In the epoch-making sound of national construction, new women should move in step; "re-depart" towards the construction road of a great era!</p>
<p>The "women's movement" of the past failed:</p>
<p>(1) In terms of psychology: Loss of confidence. Reliance on blind obedience. Hypocrisy and self-deception. Existence of passive psychology.</p>
<p>(2) In terms of ethics: No lofty concept of "self-cultivation, family management, national governance". No virtues of "valuing propriety, emphasizing righteousness, being honest and knowing shame". Failing to encourage men to "devote their loyalty to the country and their filial piety to the nation". Failing to be "public-spirited and disregarding self-interest, prioritizing the nation and forgetting the family".</p>
<p>(3) In terms of society: Not seeking social "modernization". Lacking cooperation. Not working towards the realization of a "new society". Not going deep into rural areas. Not focusing on rebuilding the grassroots work of the country.</p>
<p>(4) In terms of politics: Not striving based on the needs of the country and the trend of the times. Lacking clear and ambitious goals. Lacking lofty aspirations—not aspiring to serve on the frontier, not devoting themselves to political construction, not taking serving the country and saving the people as their ambition.</p>
<p>(5) In terms of economics: Lacking a simple and frugal life; indulging in the drunken dreams of the "Ten Miles Foreign Concession". Not "self-reliant". Lacking technical knowledge. Not engaging in the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce. Not seeking practical work. Not seeking creation. Not seeking invention. Not aspiring to be technical personnel or engineers. Not planning for "mass enjoyment".</p>
<p>The past has become "yesterday's flowers", there is no need to miss it, nor is there any need to be sad. I only hope that the "new life" will begin from now on.</p>
<p>Eastern "weak and frail," "capable of dancing in the palm of one's hand," "sleeping beauties," arise! The great wheel of the times has entered the age of atomic threats, and no longer allows you to sleep sweetly! No longer allows you to "parasitize." Lift your feet, move in step, be bold, challenge traditional thinking! March towards the road of construction!</p>
<p>Let us unfold the majestic posture of the "New Women's Movement" and "re-depart"!</p>
<p>First, eliminate the psychology of reliance and blind obedience, do not seek vanity, do not pursue luxury, do not live a romantic life. Demand practical learning, overthrow the outdated idea that "a woman without talent is virtuous"; a policy of keeping the people ignorant! Focus on reading, cultivate yourself, and bury yourself in research. Completely wash away the passive psychology of the past. Practice a simple and frugal new life.</p>
<p>Second, dedicate yourself to social work and strive for the realization of an ideal "new society." Strive for social "modernization." Advocate for the cooperative movement. Practice the grassroots work of national construction; go deep into rural areas, enlighten the illiterate, relieve the poor and weak, and seek the welfare of the people.</p>
<p>Third, new women should be "self-reliant." Use their hands and brains. Aspire to be teachers, mechanics, engineers, pilots, doctors, pharmacists, nurses, and political participants. Devote themselves to social education and cultural work, devote themselves to scientific research work, and seek new developments in agriculture, industry, and commerce.</p>
<p>Fourth, you must aspire to do great things, but do not seek to become high officials. Set ambitious goals, take serving the country and saving the people as your lifelong ambition, strive for women's suffrage, and seek the spiritual and physical liberation of women! Strive for the "freedom, equality, and happiness" of mankind. Cultivate the bright and beautiful flowers of the future world.</p>
<p>From now on, new women are no longer "powerless" and "brainless" "illiterate" figures, but rather women who are physically and mentally healthy, with practical learning, skills, and progressive thinking. To their children, they are not only "good mothers," but should also be "wise teachers"; not "blindly indulging," but "gently guiding" and teaching effectively. To their husbands, they are not only "virtuous wives," but often revolutionary "good helpmates"; not "assisting the wicked"—lacking the virtues of "honesty and shame," lacking the "faith of national construction," lacking the "morality of saving the country." Rather, they must provide spiritual encouragement; not engaging in self-interest or corruption; devoting all their loyalty to the country and their great filial piety to the nation.</p>

<h3>Landlords and Tenants Should Cooperate and Work Together</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>At present, there is a great shortage of housing in Shanghai. Many people who come from the interior cannot find housing for a while and are staying in hotels. Shanghai is experiencing a housing shortage, which naturally has its reasons. One reason is that the houses that were destroyed during the war have not been rebuilt; another reason is that the population of Shanghai is increasing day by day, but the construction of houses has not increased.</p>
<p>However, there are also many people who are taking advantage of the housing shortage to profit. In general, second landlords rent out part of their houses and demand exorbitant key money. There are also cases where they use the excuse that the contract has expired to take back the house for their own use, leading to disputes with subtenants, which are heard of every day.</p>
<p>Originally, the second landlords of Shanghai have a special face (naturally there are also good second landlords). When renting out houses, they are absolutely welcome to subtenants, but after living together for a period of time, they either restrict electricity today or restrict tap water tomorrow. The relationship between the second landlord and the subtenant becomes incompatible, which greatly hinders the construction of social order and the improvement of family life.</p>
<p>Second landlords should recognize that everything has not yet returned to normal. Even in the United States, there is a housing shortage, and it is not easy to build the necessary houses. They are also trying their best to come up with solutions based on reality: (1) Use existing movable temporary houses that are uninhabited, (2) Use abandoned but well-built residences, (3) Convert large residences and office buildings. We must also deal with the current difficulties together according to the current environment. Second landlords and subtenants should cooperate and work together and cannot be in an antagonistic position.</p>
<p>In today's world, a country cannot survive alone without other countries, and individual families can no longer "sweep the snow in front of their own doors" but should cooperate with each other.</p>
<p>Physiology</p>
<h3>Melancholy</h3>
<p>— Tracing the Cause</p>
<p>In a hospital room with windows on three sides, a girl lay quietly on a bed near the south window. Her face was dim, her brows lightly furrowed. Although a young woman just coming into her prime, she had lost the inherent charm of a maiden. Her pair of sorrowful eyes were staring blankly at a row of treetops outside the west window, bathed in the last rays of the autumn sun.</p>
<p>"Why hasn't Doctor Yu come this morning? I have something to say, but he just won't come. It's five o'clock now, isn't it? Maybe Doctor Liu will come soon. I'll tell him."</p>
<p>There was a burst of talking, followed by hurried and heavy footsteps on the stairs. Her heart pounding, she hurriedly tidied her collar and disheveled hair. At this moment, the burly figure of Doctor Liu, the hospital director, appeared before her.</p>
<p>"Good morning, Doctor Liu!"</p>
<p>Doctor Liu stood outside the threshold, nodding slightly. "Miss Shen, are you feeling well?"</p>
<p>In the past, she always answered as usual: "Yes, I am." But today, she hesitated. She couldn't say "yes," but she couldn't say "no" either. She saw that Doctor Liu looked particularly rushed today, not even stepping into the room. She almost decided not to say what she had prepared, thinking, "I'll tell him another day." But Doctor Liu, seeing her hesitant expression, stepped inside. Nurse Miss Lin followed closely behind, walking to her bedside and trying to smooth out the crumpled blanket at the foot of the bed. But Miss Shen pulled the blanket away from her feet.</p>
<p>"Doctor Liu, please take a look at this right foot. Yesterday, when my mother came to wipe my feet, she noticed that the calf and knee of this foot were swollen!"</p>
<p>Doctor Liu calmly bent down to press and knead her leg and knee for a while, then looked at her face. "This isn't swelling, it's just fat! Isn't your face fatter too?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't think so! My mother said this left foot is thin and slender."</p>
<p>Doctor Liu pressed and compared her left foot. "About the same." Then he turned to Miss Lin and said, "Test the urine." He smoothed the blanket over Miss Shen's feet and said, "It's nothing, don't worry," before hurrying out. She watched Doctor Liu's back, full of suspicion.</p>
<p>At nine o'clock in the morning, Vice President Doctor Yu routinely inspected each ward. When he and Nurse Miss Zhu walked into Miss Shen's room, they noticed the deep melancholy hidden between Miss Shen's brows as she gazed at them.</p>
<p>"Good morning, Doctor Yu! Why didn't you come yesterday?"</p>
<p>"I went to Hangzhou for a consultation. Is there anything you need?"</p>
<p>Her face turned red, and she stammered, "Yesterday Doctor Liu asked for a urine test. It just so happens... it just so happens my period came. I don't know if it's okay to test?"</p>
<p>Nurse Miss Zhu, standing next to her, suddenly covered her nose and rushed out of the room when she heard her words. She was so embarrassed that she wanted to disappear. Her originally pale face was now as red as the sunset. She said anxiously:</p>
<p>"I asked Miss Lin if it was okay to test, and she said she didn't know and told me to ask you."</p>
<p>"You can't test. Why do you need a urine test?" Doctor Yu asked calmly.</p>
<p>"Because of the leg swelling." Her nervousness lessened as she uncovered the blanket from her feet.</p>
<p>Doctor Yu kneaded and examined her leg. "It's not swollen."</p>
<p>"Oh?" She raised her head and neck to try to see her leg herself, but Doctor Yu held her body down with one hand. "Don't move! Moving will damage your spine."</p>
<p>At that moment, Miss Zhu returned to the room and made a face at Doctor Yu. "How embarrassing!" She was so embarrassed that she almost cried. Fortunately, Doctor Yu turned and left, and Miss Zhu followed him out.</p>
<p>Moonlight shone through the glass window, casting itself on the bed and the floor, reflecting a dim brightness throughout the room.</p>
<p>"Ah! Isn't today the fifteenth of the tenth lunar month? Why hasn't my period come yet? Last time it came in late August, more than half a month late. Although it's been late before, it was at most ten or eight days. Maybe I have 'dry blood consumption.' Isn't Miss Zhou in room fifteen downstairs said to have 'dry blood consumption' too? She's been in the hospital for four months, and she's still not better. I heard this disease is lingering and difficult to cure. If I also have this disease, then that's terrible, and this back pain won't get better either! Ugh!" A wave of fear washed over her.</p>
<p>"Should I ask my mother when she comes? ...No, I can't let her know, because if she knows, she'll have even more reason to send me home. Once I go home, she definitely won't let me rest like this anymore, because she says the leg swelling is the result of lying down for too long. But the doctor says it's very dangerous if I don't rest for my 'spinal consumption.' Sigh, what should I do?" Fear, sorrow, and confusion all surrounded her heart.</p>
<p>"Should I ask the doctor if I really have 'dry blood consumption' these days?" But the feeling of shame immediately pushed aside fear, sorrow, confusion and other emotions and occupied her heart alone. The impression of Miss Zhu covering her nose and rushing away a month and a half ago broke through the suppression of her strong consciousness and re-emerged in her mind. She struggled to shake off the embarrassment of that unbearable impression. "What's the use of asking? They'll always say it's not true, just like the leg swelling."</p>
<p>She fell into the abyss of melancholy. She went from suspecting to believing that she had contracted 'dry blood consumption.'</p>

<h3>This Year's Weekday Calculation Method</h3>
<p>— Peng Dou</p>
<p>Do you want to know what day of the week a certain date is in the twenty-fifth year? Here's a very accurate method for you.</p>
<p>Rule: Add one to January, add four to February, add four to March, add zero to April, add two to May, add five to June, add zero to July, add three to August, add six to September, add one to October, add four to November, and add six to December.</p>
<p>Formula: Add the date to the added number, divide by seven, and the remainder is the day of the week. If there is no remainder, it is Sunday.</p>
<p>For example: What day of the week is March 14th? What day of the week is August 25th?</p>

<h3>"Unfilial" Sons</h3>
<p>— Zi Fang</p>
<p>Because there is a saying in ancient books: 'Yao's son, Danzhu, refused,' therefore, later generations called people who are unmotivated and do not study well 'unfilial.' The meaning of these two words is unreasonable and illogical, and anyone with a little common sense will feel it. Think about it: If all sons who are bad are due to their unfilial fathers, then everyone who is a father in the world is undoubtedly Tang Yao. No wonder the Song Dynasty scholar Luo Zhongsu said: 'There are no bad parents in the world.' This sentence can be said to be a footnote to the two words 'unfilial.' If we must say that it is an unbreakable truth, then all sons who do not study well only need to marry and have children, and they will immediately become saints, which is 'as easy as turning one's hand,' why not do it?</p>
<p>However, in fact, there are many people with children around their knees who are also considered 'unfilial.' Then, does the son of this 'unfilial' son consider his father to be 'right'? For example, if someone is rebellious and disobedient to his father, then according to the iron rule that 'there are no bad parents in the world,' should that person's son consider his father's behavior of being rebellious to his grandfather to be correct, and even further imitate his father's 'excellent behavior'? If this is the case, then should that person say that his son is 'filial' and gladly endure his rebellious behavior?</p>

<h3>Social Services: Tracking Down People</h3>
<p>Seeking my cousin Li Xing, formerly named Ping, studied medicine in the United States. Before the war, he brought his niece Yu Zhen (now said to be married to a Gu) and opened a hospital on Connaught Road in Shanghai. After the incident, there was no news for a long time.

<h3>Service Briefs</h3>
<p>Introduction to a Phthisis (Pulmonary Tuberculosis) Formula. In recent years, the use of oil-soaked ginkgo nuts to treat pulmonary tuberculosis has become popular in the north, and it is indeed effective. This formula is also known in the Suzhou-Hangzhou area, but it is kept secret and not widely publicized, so few people know about it. Recently, after successful experimentation, the method, efficacy, experimentation, and administration of oil-soaked ginkgo nuts have been printed for distribution. Inquiries can be made at Bao Shan Tang, No. 24, Lane 239, Fuxing Middle Road.</p>
