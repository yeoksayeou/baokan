<h3>國大首次預備會議　熱烈討論選主席團辦法　代表充分表現民主精神</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕國民大會十八日晨十時舉行預備會議，到代表一三七二人。蔣主席今日以國民代表身份於十時正蒞臨會塲，夫人遲五分鐘亦抵達。大會即於十時十分開始。首由籌委會秘書長洪蘭友報吿，略謂：國民大會代表原定二〇五〇名，經國民政府公佈者一六九〇名，報到代表迄至今晨止，共一五〇一名，本白到會迄十時止爲一二八九名，已足法定人數，宣佈開會。同時提請公推臨時主席，經陳介生提議請孫科担任，全體均鼓掌贊同。孫氏旋即登主席座，一時水銀燈四射掌聲如雷，大會即在孫氏領導行禮下開始。今日議程即討論主席團選舉辦法，首由洪蘭友加以說明，並稱：該項草案之要點，其推選辦法之愼重，乃在使其達到選賢任能之目的。旋即由各代表發言討論應行修正各點，自始至終，發言者共三十餘人，惟要求發言者業達一〇四位，以時間關係，至十二時法定散會時，經臨時主席宣佈延長半小時，然厥不能全體發言，經於十二時四十分散會。並決定明晨九時續舉行預備會討論該項辦法。茲誌國民大會主席團選舉辦法草案，暨討論經過如次：</p>
<p>（甲）草案：第一條主席團候選人，由各代表產生單位自行選舉每單位至少一人，代表十人以上之單位，每超過十人增加候選人一名，餘數不滿十人者，四捨五入。由各單位用無記名連記法選舉之，得票較多者當選，構成候選人總名單，被推候選人不以本單位產生代表爲限。</p>
<p>第二條主席團主席五十五人，由大會代表就主席團候選人總名單，用無記名連記法選舉之，得票較多者當選，票數相同以抽籤定之。</p>
<p>第三條由國民政府直接遴選代表所選出之主席團候選人，應獲選主席之人數，得依各代表產生單位人數之此例產生之，不及比例額數時，得單獨計算。</p>
<p>第四條本辦法經國民大會預備會議通過後施行。</p>
<p>（乙）討論經過：今日討論問題，雖僅主席國選舉辦法一項，但各代表均極注重，以極愼重態度進行研討，發言者極踴躍，要求發言者達一零四人，以時間限制，僅三十餘人能發表意見，情况熱烈，迄十二時半尚不能有所決定，旋由主席宣佈，定十九日九時再舉行預備會，繼續討論。茲綜合各項意見如次，一，職業代表與區域代表應分開提出，候選人因職業與區域代表係分別產生者，尤以農工商各團體，應分別提出；二，應特別重視農民，因中國有百分之八十五以上爲農民，不應忽視職業團體，忽視農民利益；三，主張修正選舉辦法第一條最末一句，即：「被推選人不以本單位產生代表爲限」。有人主張取消其中「不」字，有人認爲應全句取消；四，應重視邊疆士著民族，特別給予名額；五，不分區域，進行普選；六，按照全體人數分配，每三十七人推選一人；七，每一單位推選一人，首先規定五十五個單位；八，要求按下列比例分配區域代表二十人，職業代表十人，自由職業二人，特選代表四人，國府直接遴選代表十九人，共五十五人。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕國大預備會爲選舉主席團辦法一事，發言者達數十人，實極表現民主化。據陳立夫稱，國大爲民主之第一調，吾人對今日此項熱烈情形甚表愉快，蓋民主者本爲浪費時間之舉，然此項浪費時間爲綜合各方意見，故爲求完美意見，雖稍感費時，仍屬必要。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕吳鐵城十八日上午八時半，自滬飛京，旋即出席國大預備會。</p>
<h3>主席團候選人數　總計二百十二人　國大籌委會草擬之辦法</h3>

<h3>周恩來等　今飛延安</h3>

<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕周恩來定十九日晨乘馬帥五星專機飛返延安，同往者十四人，董必武及其發言人等，則仍留京。某氏稱，此不能謂國共已破裂，僅可謂係一時之中斷而已。</p>
<h3>中樞紀念週　蔣主席致訓</h3>
<p>勗勉制定完善憲法</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕中樞紀念週今日因國大預備會，定十時開會，提前於上午八時半舉行。中央執監委員，各機關首長，次長及國大代表中之中國國民黨黨員，均出席參加。蔣主席親臨領導行禮，並致訓詞，略謂：因國大開會，得與各代表相聚一堂，甚爲欣慰，召開國民大會，爲本黨與全國國民多少年來所奮鬥之目標，本黨秉承總理暨諸先烈之　敎，及其革命精神，五十餘年艱苦奮鬥，即爲召開國大，制頒憲法，奠立建國基礎，故本次大會，實關係吾人建國大業之成敗，諸位責任極爲重大，盼在此决會議中，能制定一完善之憲法，以慰總理暨諸先烈在天之靈。主席繼勗勉各代表要和藹謙虛，開會時，要有秩序，並守紀律，詞畢，領導宣讀黨員守則，歷時四十分鐘禮成。</p>
<h3>各黨派審議憲草　預定今日可完成</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕憲草審議會十七日三時在孫科寓邸舉行，到王寵惠，孫科，吳經熊，林彬，陳啓天，左舜生，王雲五，繆嘉銘，張君勱，至六時始舉。十八日所研討者，仍爲過去政協憲草審議會所通過，復經王寵惠，吳經熊在文字上有所校訂者。本日對原則無改動，僅文字上有所修酌，聞大部份已審議完畢。十九日三時再舉行第二次會，諒可全部完成。</p>
<h3>曾琦談制憲</h3>
<p>應超黨派超地方性</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕曾琦十八日在川·康·滇·黔·貴五省市代表聚餐中，就制憲意見發表談話，强調憲法是超黨派超地方性者，爲國家而制，非爲黨派或地方面制，應國家至上，民族至上，任何一黨一派決不能以其片面意思貫澈整個憲法。渠並表明靑年黨決無片面意思，當力求憲法之完整性。近略感不適正事靜養</p>
<h3>李璜日內晉京</h3>
<p>近略感不適正事靜養</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕年黨領袖李璜，近來奔走和平，甚爲勞頓，身體略感不適，遵醫生囑，稍事靜養，日內即晋京出席國大。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口十八日電〕靑年黨代表陳一淸，十七日自湘乘車抵漢，定十八日午或十九日晨與該黨留漢代表胡自翔，李毓華等飛京出席國大。</p>
<p>又與賀耀組同來者，尙有湘代表仇鱉，戴國璋等，均定十八日飛京。</p>
<h3>民社黨代表由京抵平　商參加國大問題　陳總長等與張君勱晤談</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十八日電〕張君勱代表孫寳剛，十八日下午五時飛抵平，當驅車赴民社黨中常委胡海門寓休息，並應胡晚宴，有該黨中常委梁秋水及其他民社黨重要人員十餘作陪。席間即討論民社黨參加國大間題。聞孫下機後，即向胡梁等表示，君勱先生派我來徵求北方同人意見。對參加國大問題，君勱先生無意獨斷。截至記者發電時，胡宅晚宴猶未散。民社黨第二號領袖張東蓀，昨日接張君勱促其赴南京電報後，繞室躊躇，心神極不安。今日記者二度往訪，張均守口若瓶，謂在未與同人會商決定前，不願發表任何談話。聞張於十六日曾電上海民社黨總部，反對參加國大，謂：「切勿表決參加，否則本黨分裂」。迄至今日，張此意似仍堅決。今日截至下午五時止，張氏尙在燕大卅一號敎職員宿舍中，焦思此重大問題。據其夫人言：今晚張與梁漱溟，將赴淸華應潘光旦宴。某熟悉該黨內情者稱：民社黨有七常委，上海方面有四常委，其中有三常委贊成參加國大，一常委反對；北平有三常委，爲張東蓀，胡海門，梁秋水，張·胡·梁反對參加，故民社黨頗有因此問題而分裂之可能。孫寳剛此行，與張等商談，結果如何，截至發電時止，尙無所知。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十八日電〕張君勱二代表抵平後，葉篤裝即逕由機塲赴燕大與張東蓀商談。孫寳剛即進城與胡海門等商談。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕據聞張君勸對政府所提四項意見，政府大致可以同意。張君勱本日甚忙，雷震於九時往訪，十一時張羣往訪，下午四時雷再往訪，五時邵力子亦往訪，七時則赴陳誠，王世杰之宴。民社黨孫寳剛，葉篤義已於十八日晨飛平，日內可返京，該黨提交國大名單一事，不日可決定。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕陳誠，王世杰十八日晚七時在普陀路八號宴客，計到張嘉璈，張軍，傳斯年，范予遂，周鯁生，高一涵，蕭一山，繆嘉銘，張君勱，左舜生，曾琦，陳啓天，顧毓琇，張伯謹，童冠賢等，餐後並有所晤談，至九時許始陸續散去。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕民盟人士十八日晨九時曾舉行內部會議，下午四時部力子曾訪羅隆基等，六時半羅隆基，章伯鈞訪周恩</p>
<p>（上）國大預備會主席孫科。（下）列席預備會之國大代表，主席夫婦亦在座。（本報特派攝影記者顧廷　　）</p>
<h3>中共對府委名額　可能同意十三名</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕國府委會改組一事，在研討中。至府委名額問題，中共前所堅持之十四名，現已放棄，可能同意政府十三名之意見。中共及民盟之名額，均予以保留。某氏稱：如張君勱參加，則亦即係民盟份子。又政府對改組政院一事，亦在考慮中。</p>
<h3>傘兵總隊聲明　所部絕未他調</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州十八日電〕傘兵總隊司令馬師恭少將，十八日午發表靈要聲明如下：中國降落傘部隊，僅傘兵總隊一個，由本人負責統率，現所部兵力完全分駐京滬沿線，一部分且正集中南京訓練，絕無他調，外傳已集中陝甘寗邊區附近一節，堪稱荒謬已極。共產黨此項消息，用意純在强調戰爭氣氛，企圖掩飾其備戰行爲之不當，係混淆世界聽聞也。</p>
<h3>鈕永建抵瀋</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十八日電〕鈕永建偕夫人，十八日午飛抵瀋，擬在此勾留五六日，十九日起開始視察黨務，然後赴長春·永吉。</p>
<h3>實施進口全面管制　工業將獲得保護　王雲五補充進出口管制意見</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕宋子文發表進出口管制談話後，經濟部長王雲五，十七日加以補充稱：進口管制在目前有此必要，亦爲今日我國幼稚工商界一致要求，此次當盡將所有進口全面管制，其中規定將機器。工業器械，主張從優從寛，而對其他進口則較前爲嚴。相信政府對於工業從此可護得保護，同時國際盟友亦定能對吾人此舉有所解諒。進口管制後，進口量不一定就此减少，然多爲吾人所必需者，對於此項必需品，政府應加强運輸，予以便利。但對民族有碍者，應加嚴管制，是合理的。因如是始能培養吾人之工業，增加生產也。此次公佈之辦法甚佳，惟執行上尙需補充與鄭重研究。</p>
<h3>國大預備會花絮</h3>
<p>— 本報記者張明</p>
<p>蔣主席以國民代表的身份在會塲出現，事先無人知道，悄悄的就進來。坐在他抽中的第一號位子上，的五分鐘後，蔣夫人着淡咖啡色海虎絨大衣至，坐第二號，與主席及白部長左右爲鄰。</p>
<p>白部長一進會塲，遇見記者首先便說：你們新聞多了。陳立夫與一西藏穿喇嘛裝的代表同進會塲，邊走邊談。王世杰對表決器極感興趣，站立該處仰觀數分鐘之久。十一時十分，邵力子退席，十三分王世杰退席，敏感的記者，立刻猜測到兩位政協代，先後出場的原因，結果當記者在休息時間內去參政會時，却見邵氏正在辦公室改造舊信封。</p>
<p>會議到了十一點時候，尙無一點眉目，有一位代表，在沒有經過民權初步的程序要求發言的時候，就站起來發言，大聲疾呼，請主席注意控制時間。却不料接下來另一位代表又以更大的聲浪來說：「即使到了明天也還是要討論，不能以時間來限制」。於是會塲立趨紛亂。</p>
<p>戴于兩院長都穿了長袍馬褂，戴院長正襟危坐若有所思，于院長不斷翻閱議事日程和手册以及報紙。</p>
<p>陳果老着中山服，也許是爲了咳嗽，頸閱圍着毛綫圍巾。不斷的注意新聞記者的動態。有人說：「果老又在研究靑年記者的態度和採訪技巧了」。</p>
<p>代表休息室中，在休息時間內，到處擠滿了人，新聞記者穿梭似的來去，織成了新聞網。</p>
<p>女代表莊靜，陳逸雲站在一起，都穿了深綠色的呢質旗袍，但是陳瘦，莊肥，是一個很强烈的對照。</p>
<p>今天發言的，說四川話的不少，女代表無一人，但散會後，劉　衡靜却一再和記者說：「女的要吃虧的，我本來要說話，可是大家對這個草案根本原則都在發生動搖之時，我就更不好說話了」。</p>
<p>張道藩說話最有條理，而且也最淸楚，引起全塲人士的注意。</p>
<p>旁聽的新聞記者，於八時許就到會塲佔領坐位，等到大會開始，坐位早已沒有，後到的自然只有站在那裏作璧上觀靑年黨代表曾琦，在會塲中到處握手。</p>
<p>在政府公佈了修正進出口貿易暫行辦法的今天，王雲五成了採訪記者的對象，但他的話並不多。</p>
<p>吳鐵城今最才由滬返京，十時前就出現在會場，頗受人注目。</p>
<p>李宗仁的座决在旁邊，因爲他個兒比較小，許多人都忽略了他，雖然三顆輝煌的將星，還是讓記者們明白了他的身份。</p>
<p>散會時已經十二時卅五分，大家飢腸轆轆，只聽得大會事務人員在報吿，某處招待代表，某處招待記者。</p>
<p>商主席偕夫人是在十一時一刻後休息時間內離去的。但就在夫人離去前爲記者羣包圍請其簽名，夫人以國民代表的身份，爲一般國民簽字。</p>
<p>主席孫科每次說話，其中必夾以乾咳之聲，坐在主席的靠背椅裏參閱文件，如在立法院一樣。</p>
<p>推選主席時，正當麥格風裏提名到孫科的時候，適值孫院長偕吳鐵城秘書長步入會塲，一時歡迎的掌聲，如春雷乍發。</p>
<p>蔣主席在座，曾出五十一型派克，摘錄各代表的發言。十一時一刻，遞上意見紙，建議休息五分鐘。</p>
<p>休息以後，蔣主席離去。白部長獨自一人悄然坐着，頻頻看表，到十二時，就手挾皮包匆匆而去。，苗夷代表協砥中，發言最激昻慷慨。</p>
<p>張羣雖已報到，並未出席，諒必又是爲商談奔忙去了。</p>

<p>〔中央社東京十八日專電〕據盟軍總部經濟工業組工業及賠償科科長雷戴今日稱：中國將獲得日本作爲賠償之工業設備及機器中之大部份，至於此類賠償物品之運華，則將爲一長時期以後之事。數月以前，我政府即曾請求發給各式急需之設備及機器，以作爲戰爭期內被日軍破壞各區建設及復員之用。但盟軍總部當局在未得華盛頓遠東委會同意前，不能答允中國之要求，能合中國特殊用途相當數量之物資，自本年元月份起即早應自日本啟運，作爲賠償。遠東委會之延遲分配日本賠償物資，乃由於蘇聯拒絕參加本年八月間所召集之賠償會議所致。不僅中國政府，即其他盟國以及盟總當局本身，均亟欲澄清有關問題，面對日本賠償物資採取行動。盟總對此，尤爲關切，因關於日本工廠可認爲免於充作賠償一事之久懸不決，將躭擱工業恢復，而間接亦延長佔領時期。目前不論蘇聯參加討論與否，美國最近之決定進行分配日本賠償物資，可產生明確行動。鮑萊報告杜魯門總統，建議美國立即開始收集日本賠償物資，結果可能加速進行此事；但「立即」一詞，多少容易引起誤解，因收集日本各項實物賠償，爲一異常複雜之問題也。各種小件物品，如器械工具，發電機及其他各獨立單位之器械，數週內即可卦裝啟運，但拆裝整個工廠或需時數月。各咱機械工具及其他小件物品之清冊，頃已造就，各工廠各部狀況報告書，均在準備中，但欲尋得合乎各同盟國家所要求之動力廠，及特殊用途之工廠，則頗困難。盟總當局對賠償物資搬走後，日本經濟所受之影響，已爲之焦慮。保護及卦裝各項搬走之機件，又需極大量之木料，鐵釘，及脂油，僅此數項，即爲一巨大之支出。數月前日本農林省官員曾予估計，封裝賠償物資所需木料，幾等於日本全國房屋建設所需之木料，日本國內運輸計劃所需亦極龐大；其他如何自日本運出賠償物資，亦成爲問題，日本現有運輸能力實不足作爲運輸賠償物品之用，大多數借予日政府作爲遣送日人返國用之美自由輪，亦已歸還美國，運輸將爲中國一特大問題，蓋中國所有船隻有限，而自日啟運之機器，其總量則極大也。</p>
<h3>中瑞新約批準書　昨舉行換文典禮　三分鐘內即完成手續</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕中瑞（典）新約批準書換文典禮，十八日下午二時一刻在外部舉行。二時許，瑞典駐華公使亞勒，偕商務秘書龍海德抵達外部，當由交際科長王季徵招待，陪至二樓會客室稍憇，旋王外長與甘次長乃光·王化成·葉公超·陳雄飛·陳明池偕來，王外長與亞勒公使握手問好，欣謂：「今日真好天氣！」後，即開始交換簽字於預置室內長案上之兩批準紅本上，一時水銀燈大明，攝影記者紛搶鏡頭。王外長以毛筆及鋼筆并簽字中英文名字，亞勒則以鋼筆簽署瑞典名字。兩人簽字并加蓋橡皮關防後，同舉香檳互賀，全部典禮手續於三分鐘內即告完成。亞勒再與王外長閑談片刻，至下午二時二十分携一約本辭去。按中瑞關於取消瑞典在華治外法權及其他有關特權之條約，業於三十四年四月五日於重慶簽字，并經兩國政府批準，依該約　第八條之規定，自兩國政府相互通知批準之日起即發生效力。該約已於同年七月二十日經兩國政府批準生效，今日爲雙方批準約本之換文，共交換兩份。瑞公使亞勒於換文後，接見記者，發表談話稱：瑞典人民對中國攸久之文明，及航綫，約每月一班，另有二公司并經營中美航綫。</p>

<h3>漢奸之家屬　生活費問題</h3>
<p>司法院參事有新解釋</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕關於漢奸家屬生活費酌留問題，自司法院解字第三二一三號解釋發表后，一般因其過於抽象，咸認處理時將生困難。記者爲此事走訪司法院革參事，承告：各地情形不同，各人家庭狀況亦異，因之對漢奸家屬生活費，自難作肯定之規定，惟漢奸家屬有獨立能力，能自謀生活者自不予酌留，故雖無硬性之規定，處理時尚不致有如想象中之困難。至漢奸債務清償問題，所以規定執行機關不負清理之責者，爲限冒名索取債務，此事對少數債權人雖失之公平，然爲保一般利益，此種規定實有其必要。</p>
<h3>京滬與西北之間　陸空交通日迅捷　徐州至西安直達車恢復</h3>
<p>〔本報西安十七日電〕停開幾達十年之隴海鐵路徐州本案間直通車，最近有新編列車「黃河號」，以實際行車時間僅二十六小時之速率恢復。此間人士甚感興奮。眾認該開車若不在開封停留一夜，在徐州再與開往浦口及上海之列車時刻聯接，則上海與西安間旅程，可能縮短爲三日，「黃河號」列車亦可由每週往返一次而增爲二次。蘇，豫，陜，甘，晉南，鄭北五省之客貨，郵運，當大受稗益。惟目前該鐵路沿綫仍分段售票，而每次換車即爲黑市車票之活動機會，其票價甚有漲至一倍以上者。</p>
<p>又，西安與京滬間空運近益形暢達，惟航空行程雖僅有六七小時之距離，而「航泱」函件仍鮮能在一百小時以內投達，航寄報紙甚至有需七日者，此實有待於郵局之改善。</p>

<h3>社論　國際局勢的新趨勢</h3>
<p>大約由於國大的召開，一般人的視綫都似乎集中在國內；然而近日來，國際間的一股新趨勢，卻不容我們忽視的。這一股新趨勢，表現於兩咱不同的事態上。第一，是美國競選的結果，被稱爲右傾的共和黨在美國的國會中占着控制的多數；第二，是歐洲左翼政團的抬頭。歐洲基翼政團的抬頭，又表現於兩種不同的事態：（一）法國總選舉的結果，共產黨又重復變爲第四共和國的第一政黨；（二）英國工黨內部的分裂自由徵象—這表現於英國工黨議員數十人，在下院對政府的外交政策表示異議，要求修正。這一種國際局勢的新趨勢是值得我們注意的。</p>
<p>這一股國際局勢的新趨勢，表現出兩種不同的姿態，在美國是所謂右傾的共和黨的得勢，在歐洲是左翼團的抬頭。但倘若我們一加究詰，此種趨勢的姿態或形相雖有不同，然促成的因素，則彼此同之。這促成的因素是什麼？這就是蘇聯勢力的膨脹。自納粹乞降歐戰停止以來，蘇聯的勢力積極向歐陸擴展，波羅的海的立陶宛，拉脫維亞，愛沙尼亞，在戰前原是獨立國畳如今已併入蘇聯版圖固不必說，波蘭，羅馬尼亞，匈牙利，南斯拉夫，甚至捷無斯拉夫現在事實上也已經變了蘇聯的附庸。在戰敗的德國，蘇聯的占領區，在面積上固大於英美法的占領區，而且在德國人民的心理上，又是德國的心臟，加以在世界各處，自韃靼尼爾海峽以至遼遠的各處，包括自非洲的印度洋岸，至北太平洋的千島，以迄水雪荒涼的南極，蘇聯都在表示它的勢力。人類從第二次世界大戰中過來所發現的是蘇聯勢力的惡性膨脹；就是以租借物資供給蘇聯，使它打退了納粹的德國，美國在此種情形之下，也有應付爲難之感。對蘇綏靖嗎？這倒底有失美國的尊嚴。所以儘管有像華萊士之流，主張對蘇綏靖，然而美國的輿論，總期期以爲不可。對蘇採取強硬政策嗎？美國的現勢又不許可。貝爾納斯的政策之所以軟中有硬，硬中有軟者，就是爲此。</p>
<p>由於美國對蘇的沒有堅定政策，這結果卻造成蘇聯勢力的再擴張。對於這種局勢，歐洲人的感覺是特別銳敏的；更何況左翼政黨如共產黨那樣的，原與莫斯科通聲氣。利用了人民對於蘇聯的畏懼，對於美國的失望，於是共產黨及左翼政團便大有用武之地。這是爲此，所以此次在法國的普選，共產黨重又抬頭而成爲法國的第一政黨。這也是如此，所以英國現在執政的工黨，也有了分裂的徵兆。講到英國，它的工黨與歐陸的左翼政黨原有顯然的區別。社會主義在英國本祇是知識階級的一種消遣，它本沒有大陸上的左傾色彩；其後雖有職業工會等團體的加入，然其一貫的作風是合法及有秩序的門爭，不像大陸社會主義的傾向暴亂。自工黨在總選舉中得勝出組政府以來，秉承了這種保守的傳統，在美蘇爭雄的局勢下，採取了比較親美的政策；因爲這種政策的採取，合於工黨的條件，同時，又合於英國的條件。可是一年以來，蘇聯勢力的擴張如故，於是引起了少數年青情激的工黨議員的不滿，致對蘇綏靖所採取的新孤立主義，有異曲同工之妙。現在艾德禮政府旣因此而要求信任的表決，其必不能得到英國工黨議員的多數支持，殆可斷言。</p>
<p>因爲當今美國政府對於蘇聯的沒有堅定政策，同時，在世界各處以及美國國內的沒有政策，這結果就表現在美國此次選舉共和黨的得勢。雖然共和黨及民主黨雙方都稱此次選舉的結果，對於美國的外交政策沒有影響。但我們得明瞭此次選舉對美國外交政策之所以沒有直接影響者，不是共和黨對民主黨有什麼好感；而是民主黨依舊掌握有行政的大權。美國人民對於民主黨雖已表示厭棄，可是格於憲法的規定，共和黨卻無權組織政府。共和黨的對外政策，自然要比民主黨的來得現實。即以中國而論，在民主黨執政的時代，可以有藍辛石井協定於前，可以有雅爾達協定於後；而在共和黨的時代，我們就看見有華盛頓會議，以及中國關稅自主的協定。共和黨是以「大棒」政策出名的。此次選舉雖給他們在國會的控制，沒有給他們行政的大權；但由於這次選舉的結果，可能使杜魯門總統的政府，在對外政策上採取更堅定的立場。</p>
<p>所以無論從哪一方面看，目前這股國際新趨勢所呈現的姿態雖不同，然論其本質則一，就是如何應付蘇聯勢力的續續擴展。我國與蘇聯的關於最爲重要，中蘇國界的綿長，世無其匹；我們應該珍視蘇聯的陸誼，那末，我們對於蘇聯又將如何自處呢？這實在是值得我們鄭重考慮的。</p>

<p>國內問題專家預測</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十七日電〕美國內問題專家於研究全國之購買及生產狀况後，預料明春將發生戰後第一次經濟波動，然大規模之波動則須待至兩年以後。但明春發生之經濟波動。在全國甚至國外亦均不免受其影饗。目前美國已達蓬勃時期，就業人數之多，失業人數之少，均已達美國空前紀錄，全國收入突破一切紀錄，生產數字亦超過以前所有之數字，故此乃眞正蓬勃之現象，因比相反的波動狀態遲早終不免發生。若十樂觀的美國人認爲美人之購買力猶綽有餘裕，蓋在戰爭期間生活緊縮，人民多有節蓄，而至戰後，各種物品之需要量均大爲增加，蓬勃現象猶可維持相當時期。然一方面則亦有人指出此項理論之不可靠，彼等提出兩點事實，以資證明：一爲戰時儲蓄額之增加並不普遍，實際上僅百分之十之民擁有大量儲蓄金，其餘百分之九十之人民或在銀行中有少數存款，但決不足以應付物價之增加；其决物價上漲殊鉅，購買者不久即將達到雖需要但不願　無力購買之一日。今若干製造商業已發見前一趨勢。美國之專家復謂：避免明春之經濟危機，有兩種可能性：（一）由各工業聯合一致，採取不漲價政策，或甚至减價政策；（二）由於工潮之發生，工資亦隨之提高，使工人得以應付上昇之生活費用，但此乃暫時的拖延政策，至最後，更惡劣的經濟危機必將爆發。國外市塲或可使許多製造商渡過明春難關，然政府若不能採取更好之政策以調和美國之人力，生產，及世界之需要，則較明春更惡劣之狀態終必來臨。</p>
<h3>佔領期中的日本（下）佔領工作分爲三個階段</h3>
<p>— 紐約時報駐東京特派員　派勞脫原著　張德乾譯</p>
<p>每一個有思想的日本人都知道：在今日環境之下，惟有合作才是出路，即使是或許尙躲在地下盼望着＂Der　Tag”（德語：那一天）從速到來的殘餘軍閥們，也是如此想法。佔領工作結束得愈快，日本各黨各派從事各別政治活動的機會也來得愈快，尤其是那些極端派。保守派的朝日新聞在日本銷數最大，某日曾扼要地表示道：「佔領工作能否在短期內完成？端視佔領部隊能否與日本人民順利合作。」換一句話說，合作的程度愈大，佔領的結束愈快。</p>
<p>有幾種重要的因素須加考慮。第一，佔領當局曾廣泛地調查過，並未發現有組織的地下活動。第二，日本的自由份子對我們所提供的制度予以贊助，擬促其實現。可是另有一羣人（人數究有幾何，是無法估計的），却感到痛心，充滿着憤恨，在等候機會，重建舊有的封建政治。還有一羣人在追求蘇聯式的暴力革命，現已相當普遍的共禪宣傳，就以這羣人爲主要目標。</p>
<p>有一個値得注意的因素是最純樸的日本老百姓，曾於今年四月誰明他們確能從事民主選舉。當他們被許自由投票時，他們就表示了顯著地歧異的政治觀點，從純粹的共產主義，到佔領軍所允許的範圍，無不表示出來。得票最多的人中，有一人後來被麥帥總部認爲係不良份子而宣吿取消資格的，他就是自由黨領袖鳩山一郞。</p>
<p>由這種顯著的政治意識，可以看出日本人過去在精神上所受軍閥統制的影響，並不如一般想像之甚；至少現在，如果再想統制，是不會那樣容易就範了。日本人或許是不大注意理論的，雖然他們大多數都似乎情願犧牲舊傳統，來享受新賦給他們的自由；請看他們自願選舉許多婦女爲新國會的議員，雖然他們從前一向認爲婦女是低劣的。他們所需要的是衣，食，住，和相當的政治安定，足以使他們恢復工作，有機會重建他們的生活。</p>
<p>日本人已在慢慢地開始向建設之涂茹辛含古地前進着。日本市鎭在推行着建設計劃者，我們看見有許多小木屋像雨後春筍似地在爲炸彈所毁的遺址中重建起來。有一天，靜岡市曾光榮宣吿：牠自己爲全日本首先替被炸難民完成建屋計劃的一個市。　跳舞塲重新開門了。小舖子裏堆存着簡單的貨物。記者寫此文時，窗外正有一羣日本孩子在玩小型棒球，跑着，呌着，笑着。東京的酒菜館近來對少數幸運的有產階級供應着家華的餐食，因此政府對客飯的限價便更加嚴厲了。—光亮的汽車駛過東京街頭，牠們不是盟軍將領的汽車，牠們是日本人的，一年以前牠們都藏在最隱蔽的地方，深怕被佔領部隊拿去。可是如果你想買一輛這種汽車時，那其所索日元代價之鉅，幾乎可以和自地球到火星的哩程相等。沒有人對日元有何信心，通貨膨脹是在不斷地進行着。</p>
<p>日本的工業原可吸收那些失業份子，卻受着那尙未解決的賠款問題的影響。假使一家工廠將來是要拆散了運到外國去作爲償付戰債之用的，日本人顯然是不願爲着替失業份子找工作做，而把牠重建，修理，改裝，或擴充的。</p>
<p>首相吉田茂有一天在議會演說，曾用最簡單的措辭，說明戰後日本須維持戰前百分之七十的人口，祗有戰前百分之五十六的土地，尙須减去多種物產，現在不得不自國外輸入，而以工業品償付其代價。這實在是一切問題由最基本的問題</p>
<p>當佔領工作進入第二年的時候，盟軍對於這許多問題能否獲得一個答案，（聯合國在他們本國也常有許多同類的問題無法解決）實在是一種「賭博」，不僅對於麥帥是如此，對於整個西方世界也莫不如此。</p>

<h3>魚市塲放本收鮮　引起外界指摘　唐承宗發表談話</h3>
<p>上海魚市塲因在沈家門設立臨時辦事處，辦理大對船放本收鮮，引起外界指摘。本埠小型報及寗彼地方報亦有刋載其事者。茲據該塲總經理唐承宗談稱：此事報載與事實諸多不符，緣沈家門向常之習慣，大對船出漁，例須向魚商借本，而魚高欲在當地收鮮，亦遂視放本爲應分之舉。年來因魚商營業不振，致大對船漁本苦難借到，無力及時出漁，頓現生產衰落之象。太塲徇關心漁業各方之請求，勉力籌撥業務資金兩億元，辦理大對船放本收鮮，原係應事實切要，冀有所補濟，惟以限於財力，數額太少，不克普遍放貸，又因組織簡單，不克多多延攬各方推　之人才，致遭向隅者之不滿，謂利率按月一角，以高利貸剝削漁民。其實規定利率，按月六分，與一般銀錢業往來拆息相較，賠貼已不在少數。又謂放款係由少數魚棧包辦，其實所有放款，全係辦事處直接核辦，並不假手他人，甚且謂款額之兩億元，係動用農民銀行漁貸，於中取利者。其實農行辦理漁貸，係由該行以直接方式分戶貸放，且早在五六月之前，現正陸續到期，由該行分別收回中，而本塲此次放本之款，則係本塲業務資金之一部，放出未久，須於收鮮時，陸續收回，完全兩事，豈能併爲一談。是外界所傳，純出誤會。惟太塲辦理是項工作，旨在調劑魚貨產銷，際此漁業衰象未獲解除，則本塲旣定方針，自當繼續認眞推行，各界如有予以善意指示者，自無不竭誠歡迎也云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市警察總局刑二科於九月底破獲一大規模有組織之專盜汽車匪窟，拘獲共犯達十五人之多，內白俄六人，國人七名，計考查夫·麥基沙夫·高爾德飛特·谷古門·伏洛寗·康來佑·嚴士鑫·石少棠·王德培·支顯宗·王芹蓀·王濂元·王樹常·黃雷夢·沈薇黃·全部案已於昨日移地檢處偵查。此案之破獲費時甚久，遠於本年五月一日，美軍上校克勞恩之自備汽車，晚上九時停於延慶路華亭路口之際，突來白俄三人，（即考查夫·麥基沙夫·高爾德飛特）其中一人持有手槍，威脅車夫胡小元開車，至冷僻處將胡推下，由其中一人駕車逸去。警局得克勞恩報告後，即偵騎四出，但苦無織索，不料事隔十天，又有市民劉德啟之自備福特汽車被劫，據車夫報告當時被劫情形，及三白俄之面貌等，與克勞恩汽車被劫情形，無一不相胞合。經警局數目之努力，卒告全案破獲，並於沈薇黃處抄得馬牌手槍一枝，聞地檢處將依公共危險，盜竊等罪起訴。</p>

<h3>不見梅郎溪醉酒十餘年　生平傑作漏演在明宵</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕梅蘭芳率領之梅劇團，此次在中國大戲院公演以來，備受熟烈歡迎，所浪各劇，悉爲梅氏精心得意之作。「貴妃醉酒」一劇，尤爲其生平傑作，係得自故名伶路三寳傳授，向不輕易出演，其名貴可見。梅氏不演此劇已十餘年，茲以各方要求，定明晚在該院公演。「醉酒」一劇，全部四平調到底，且角怕唱二簧、最怕唱四平。「身上」有「軟腰」，「臥魚」，「亮扇」等繁重做工。酒醉神情須不脫貴妃身份，限神尤難，故此劇非天份功候俱臻絕頂，即不免於「瘟」，面有吃力不討好之感矣。梅君迄今功力依舊，誠屬難能可貴，今竟漏演唱做並重之「醉酒」一劇，專覺共　可爲貴。</p>

<h3>輸入管理會執委會成立　制定輸入施行細則　市塲平靜各方面反應良好</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸入臨時管理委員會執行委員會，於昨日上午八時卅分，正式在中央銀行三樓，開始辦公。全體執行委員，旋即舉行會議。由主任委員　　給主席，出席全體委員李榦·張福運·林維英·陳長桐等四人。當即開始制定修正進出口貿易暫行辦法之施行細則，及程序，曁公吿等事項。未幾敵會，當由貝氏召集指定經營外匯業務之中外銀行廿餘家之負責人談話，吿以修正進出口貿易暫行辦法即付施行，囑各行遵行。末並由各行提出疑問，分爲解答。各行如有未盡之問題，今後仍可由書面提出。下午四時，全體執行委員又又續舉行會議，至六時許，全部施行細則，郎吿制訂完畢，由執委會委員兼秘書處長陳長桐，向新聞記者正式發表。（施行細則全部條文，詳見本報第九版廣吿）。陳氏報吿完畢後，又參加　委會繼續會議，直至七時許始吿散會。</p>
<p>又本報記者爲明瞭修正進出口貿易暫行辦法頒行後各界之反響起見，昨特分訪巾外各界領袖，及巡視市塲動態，茲將訪問經過，分別華報如决：</p>
<p>徐寄庼觀感　此舉可促進生產事業　切盼進口商勿行抬價</p>
<p>本市市商會理事長徐寄廎氏談稱：近數月來，進口貨大批來華傾銷，而出口貨則甚少，國內生產事業，備受打擊，美匯亦受相常形響，故工商界常嘖有繁言。茲者修正辦法頒佈施行，對非必要之進口貨，加以限制。必要之進口貨，則予以方便。而出口貨中、除禁止出口者外，均可自由出口。此舉可促進我國之生產事業，對我國之經濟情形，將有莫大之帮助。又此次執行委員會負責諸公，堪稱一時之選，各委員平時學識經騐豐富，故當能圓滿達成任務。惟有一點須加注意，即已進口之貨，或將見機騰漲。深望各進口商，爲顧全大衆福利，勿任意抬價是幸。</p>
<p>加強金融地位　促使經濟穩定</p>
<p>芙商會理事長談片</p>
<p>英國商會理事長凱捷克氏談稱：該項修正辦法之施行，足證政府決心維持並加强中國之金融地位。穩健而謹愼之進口商，對該項辦法，常表歡迎。蓋以長期眼光目之，該項辦法將使經濟情况，趨於穩定。又負責執行委員會諸公，均係素著聲譽之士。惟如將該項辦法加詳研究，外商方面，將產生三項主要問題：（一）已　立之合同，將如何處理。（二）未設有限額之各進口貨，其限額　如何確定。（三）工業器材之輸入，常需積年累月。中央銀行對該方面所需之外匯，是否可以供給。凱氏旋稱：以上純係出自會卒間之觀察，至於有建議性之評述，固尙待該一新機構工作若干時日後，方有端倪云。</p>
<p>美商會領袖談</p>
<p>美國商會理事長施密士，以詼諧之　調，對記者談稱：該項修正辦法之來，似嫌過於敏捷。惟本人以時間所限，尙未及從詳研究全部辦法內容。　一事彰彰明甚，即每一種進日物品，均需於事先取得許可證，至申請手續如何，申請並發　　多久，申請表格是否業已印就</p>
<p>則迄無所知。又在途中之進口質，將如何處置。本人經營之着軍商業，固早在許可入口之列。故修正辦法之施行，想不致對吾業有何影響。然該項許可入口制度，今則已推廣及於一般進口貨矣。</p>
<p>申請手續應迅速　限制配額須公允</p>
<p>本市進出口商業同業公會理事長張煥章氏談稱：査目前之進口貨數量，實太龐大，而此中尤以奢侈品消耗品居多。該一辦法實施後，渠所希望者有以下數點：（一）辦理申請進口手續，應力求迅速。（二）對限制分配額，應力求公允。（三）依照辦法規定，進口商須至輸人臨時管理委員會登記。惟進口商大多在進出口公會已辦理登記，故希望如係公會會員，即足爲登記之證明。（四）對現有之執行委員中，望能有若干有關之商業團體參加，以免隔膜。（五）希望每種進口貨有一限額。在限額內，應准各進口商，自由分配道口結匯。（六）限額之分配，如何使之公允，值得從詳考慮及硏究。渠最後稱：修正辦法施行後，對進口商不習增多一重困難。因現在向外定貨，定後未必即有貨，今如在定貨前，需先經申請許可，而許可後欲定之貨，是否仍有，則更屬渺茫矣。</p>
<p>希望實施辦法　到達善意目的</p>
<p>中國進出口貿易協會總幹事張禹九氏談稱：修正辦法之頒行，不啻予國內工業生產界一復蘇之機會。例如非必要貨品之限制進口，生產機器進口之給予便利，凡此種種措施，用意殊屬良佳惟甚望當局對許可進口及不許可進口之貨品，通加以明白區別。務使許可進口之貨物，申請許可之手續，應儘量簡化，俾使迅速進口。不許可進口之貨物，不妨斷然予以禁止進口，切勿出以消極之限制辦法，一方面仍接受申請，而一方面則拖延其批准許可入口之日期，徒使商人不便。張氏旋稱：任何管制辦法之制立，用意總屬良善。深望此項辦法實施後，能充份達到其善意之目的。對出口問題，張氏提出希望兩點：（一）設法减低國內生產成本，（二）望國人勿在國外市塲，貶價傾銷，以免减跌國貨外銷之價格，徒使國家人民，兩受損失。</p>
<p>拯救工商危機　鬆動外匯頭寸</p>
<p>中國進出口貿易協會負責人邱良榮氏談稱：修正辦法之施行，對本市工業界，裨益良多。洋貨競爭之威脅，於此可吿减少。同時，政府又允發放工業貸款，對本市工商界之危機，不無挽救之處。又政府對外應頭寸之調度，又可多一重保障。邱氏認爲過去我國購買進口貨物，各進口商類多茫無頭濫買，實等於搶購物資，結果大部進口商，均吿虧蝕。今番採行許可輸入制後，該種畸形進口情形，當可改善不少。邱氏稱：本市目前之進一口行家’十九皆屬新興組織。而有若干素具悠久歷史之進口行家，亦有不加入公會爲會員者，且往往一商兼營數種進口貨物，故對登記進口商之標準，及限額之分配，亟需鄭重考慮。依邱氏觀察：修正辦法施行後，最主要之課題，厥唯走私問題。走私來源不外：（一）香港，（二）上海進口之商船。諒以限額關係，不能獲得許可進口之物資價必騰漲，利亦益厚。利之所在，商人當設法走私，故政府對此，尤應再三注意及之。</p>
<h3>美鈔黃金市價　昨日均見下挫</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自行政當局宣布實行人口許可制度後，昨日美鈔暗盤及黃金市價，均見下挫。惟據有經騐之觀察家稱：除非入口許可制實施有效，並能根絕走私，否則美鈔黑價，仍將上漲；黃金亦將隨美鈔而上昇，惟因央行壓力關係，漲勢尙不致如美鈔之猛烈。美鈔傾向漲價之理由有兩：（一）幣値不安定，放高利貸不安全，有人以購冒美鈔爲保存價値之方法。（二）目前全國各地，外貨走私依然猖獗，此類交易，均需以美鈔付現，故有人在市上收購美鈔，致日來黑市大漲。試看店舖中陳列之美貨，大多非政府許可進口之物，巾行核准外匯甚爲嚴謝格，中外商人勾結走私，均以美鈔爲支付工具。需求旣大，而供應有限，漲價爲事所必然。又股票之市價，因宋院長宣布扶助國內生產事業，人心振奮，昨晨價格曾一度上揚。惟因大局展望，仍不樂觀，午後又回疲。觀察家認爲政府之扶助，並非短期所能生效；故股票市價今後之變化，在短期內受許可入口制度實施之影響小，而受時局變化之影響大。至於市上美貨之售價，裁至昨午爲止，尙未見波動。</p>
<h3>减少不必要輸入　保獲本國工商業　視進口品需要緩急作合理分配</h3>
<p>張福運解釋新辦法要旨</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨日走訪關務署長張福運氏，詢問對於修正進出口貿易暫行辦法之感想及意見。承答稱：站在政府人員之立塲，不能作任何批評，亦無任何意見。惟對於記者所詢問各點，可歸納解釋如下：（一）政府採用進口貨許可制度之動機，決非限制人民正常需要，例如棉花爲國民之必需品，自當准其入口。政府之意，僅在將進口品之種類及數量，加以合理之分配。同時我國之國際收支，太不平衡。此項辦法實施以後，可减少不必要之輸入，使我國之進出口値能漸趨於平衡。（二）提高進口稅稅率仍在計劃研究之中，此與實行進口許可制度完全爲兩件事，兩者可互相補充。（三）將來各項商品限額之分配，爲目前最主要之工作，現由輸人臨時管理委員會詳加討硏巾。原則爲按照國民之需要而作適當之分配，此點本人不便詳談。（四）今後緝私工作將加强。本市走私之情形已减少。惟華南方面，則甚爲嚴重，今後將嵌加取締，免使不必要之外貨輸入我國市塲。（五）進口許可制度之實施，本人之看法，認爲對於中美商的並不抵觸。蓋商的之訂立，雙方完全站在平等與互惠立塲。在新辦法之下，對於友邦生產工具之進口，固萬分歡迎也。至於在倫敦國際貿易與就業會議中，我國代表團贊成美國之主張，但恐有保留處。新辦法之訂立，爲我國主權之運用，他人必能諒解。（六）新辦法並非專着月於减少入口，以求國際收支之平衡。而在商品分類之中，已寓有保護太國工商業之意。</p>
<h3>胡伯翔談感想</h3>
<p>保護我國生產事業　防止外貨可能傾銷</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國工業協會當務理事兼國貨廠商聯合會負責人胡伯翔氏，昨日對記者詳談對於我國實行進口許可制度之感想，茲歸納要點如下：（一）此項辦法之用意，在限制輕工業產品之輸入，而歡迎精細機器之進口，此對本國廠商有利，亦即保護我國之生產事業，實爲政府賢明之措施。（二）禁止我國不需要之貨物進口時，必須同時根絕走私，方能收到實效，否則名義上禁止進口，事實上依然源源走私，反而損失關稅之收入。（三）對於禁止進口之商品，應同時禁止外商在華製造同類之商品；對於限制進口之商品，應同時限制外商在華製造同類之商品，方爲澈底。對於我國不需要之商品，除嚴格實行進口許可制度外，仍應提高其進口稅稅率。（四）在限制外貨入口時，如爲原料及工業上必需之物，應先詳加調査，使正當之工商業可獲得適常之供應。必需避免此類有限額供給之商品落入投機者之手，以致居奇抬價，藉謀高利，而使正當工商業蒙受損失。同時政府應注意此類限額入口品之產地價格，藉作合理限價之依據；並調査各廠以往之需要量，作爲將來分配之標準。限額辦法，如執行不善，將爲害國貨廠商，凡此均盼政府愼重執行。以上爲胡氏站在工業協會立塲上，對於進口新辦法之感想。在國貨商業立塲上，胡氏亦認爲目前之辦法，可防止外貨之可能傾銷。目前傾銷現象固尙未發現，但如奶粉等商品，即以低價泛濫於我國市塲。爲防止此類情形起見，政府最好能在海外設立機構，調査各國出口品在太國市塲之價格，以防止傾銷。記者詢以如外貨進口激减後；國貨是否將因供給减少而漲價。胡氏認爲眞正能長期存在之工業，不致乘機圖致暴利。數月以來，國產品之價格並無狂漲之現象，相信高利貸如能取締時，進口許可制不致造成土貨之漲價。</p>
<h3>進出口公會　將集會商討　提出具體意見供政府採納</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕進出口業對於新辦法之感應，最爲敏銳。本市該業同業公會副秘書長周經爲氏對記者稱：政府此項辦法之主要用意，一爲加强整個貿易業之控制，二爲寫最近買進之大批剩餘物資求出路。過去進出口業之控制，由巾央銀行負責，責任旣過重，又與行政常局失去聯緊，今則臨時管理委員會設立，人力集巾，指揮一元化，控制大爲增强。我國最近購進之美軍剩餘物資。實際價値凡八億美元，種類繁多，爲數浩大。在新辦法之下，政府自可將其其售與進出口商人；如此物資經有銷路，政有又可成少輸入，節省外匯。預料新辦法實施後，政府對於合法經營進出口業之商家，將有嚴格之核定。同時今後商人經營進出口業者，如過去一家經營四十餘種商品者，恐再難以繼續；而商人之經營，將逐漸專業，例如經營進口機器者，不能忽而轉入進口原料，或發生類似之跳動。本市進日口會員商家在六百家以上，甚希望有特殊背景之進出口商家亦能加入公會。此類商家，因背景有力，過去曾公然致函外商，言明即使央行不核准外匯，亦可進行交易等語。此類辭令，使正直之外商亦大爲大滿。預料在新辦法下，此類進川口公司仍有其特殊之便利。進出口公會日內將集會商討，詳細硏究進口新辦法，並將提出具體意見，以供政府採納。目前希望者，即政府尊重公會之地位，將來限額之分配，能通過公會而獲得合理之解決。周氏對於進口商品之分類次序，認爲尙確當，惟分類尙不够詳細；並稱：不久將有詳細之補充辦法，對於新辦法宣布前訂購之進口物品，將有一定之處理辦法。</p>

<h3>吳市長召集紡織業　商討消滅棉紗黑市　議定辦法限期結清期貨</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長於昨（十八日）午二時半，在市府大禮堂召開緊急會讓，商討消滅棉　黑市辦法，計到中國紡建公司總經理束雲章，第六區棉紗公會理事長王啓宇，紡管會林　包，楊錫仁，染織業潘士浩，針繼業徐昭侯，手帕萊姚思偉，棉織業董久峰，崇信紗廠　實虎，申新紗廠榮鴻元，永安紗廠郭棣活，統益紗廠董春芳等，由吳市長主席，首先申　政府對於取締棉紗黑市之決心，希望各界切勿以爲頒布之法令，乃一紙具文而已。政府已抱有最大決心，對於黑市之取締，必須澈底做到。繼謂，所以今天要召集緊急會議，是接奉宋院長昨自南京來電，囑轉吿紗商，實行加强竹制進口貨後，對本國紗商有利。並稱棉花的來源絕無問題，則棉紗可儘量生產，黑市絕無存在之理由。吳市長昨日下午並親往各棉紗市塲巡視，結果査得江西路協和紗號有重大無弊情形，該號於十月二十五日買紗二九〇件，但其中竟有八十件之去路不明，現已予澈査。此外，對於目前黑市之製造因素，經昨午之調査後，收獲良多，且已搜集大批證據，站在政府之立塲上，本當嚴厲處分，但爲使各位能有機會，在心理上爲澈底的改變，所以從寬，希望各位要多爲大衆着想。吳市長發言時，能度堅決語調極爲沈重。末稱：今日在坐各位皆爲棉紗業，紗廠業代表，對於爲什麽仍有黑市價格之存在，請予解答，並共同討論取締辦法。</p>
<p>發生黑市原因</p>
<p>第六區棉舫公會理事長王啓宇發表意見：謂棉紗產量每月六萬五千件是不正確的，目前本市棉紗產量，每天的可剩餘四〇〇件，每月以廿四天計，每月之餘一額的爲一萬二千件。現民營廠家之唯一希，乃爲儘力添置新錠子及新設備。關於黑市之因素，王氏認爲十二磅細布價格上漲，每疋布可賺二萬元，所以商人都要多進紗，在供不應求之情形下，黑市應運而起。</p>
<p>第六區棉紡公會理事唐星海稱：黑市之原因有二：（一）複製業所需用的是廿支紗，而配到的却爲卅二支，則必售后此而購彼。（二）各產家需用之神類不同，如習慣用「　　」者，必拒用「雙馬」，買賣之間，黑市遂造成。</p>
<p>葉　業　士　謂：複製品六個公會之第一步工作，乃制止以黑　價　買出，但是因爲配紗量之不足，實無法禁止其買進。故主張若　紗不能增加，則願意减工，但工人方面，希望市府設法調解。並主張棉紗配價可予酌量提高。</p>

<p>末由紡建公司束雲章報吿該公司之眞實內容，謂年內大部份棉紗之產量，須供給製軍服之用，明年五月內，亦須留相當之數量，故紡建公司實已盡最大之努力，對於增加生產一層，目前尙難談到。對於配紗方面，希望能達到卞分之八九成，複製業方面可把所需之詳細名單開具，並稱這個時候是需要「相讓爲國」的，希望大家切勿氣餒。並且在供應不能相抵之目前，望各廠商能不做期貨。</p>
<p>末由吳市長發表結論：（一）節電問題，已與市公用局商妥，即將發動市府高級職員，親赴各街道各商店懇切勸吿。吳市長亦決親自出動，以身作則。並保證節電問題，必定澈底實現，以增加生產。（二）棉花問題，若廠商欲赴外埠，如漢口鄭州等地採購棉花，而缺乏資金者，則保證中央銀行必可設法貸借。最後，吳市長認爲各廠商做期貨而不負擔利息，極不合理。對於取締黑市問題，議決重要辦法四項：（一）自今日起，至廿五日止，各廠商所有期貨（已繳淸者除外），在本星期內一律理淸，照一角拆息計算，退還持單人。吾則准持單人向市府吿發。（二）此後各廠商再有期貨交易時，必須先扣除利息。（三）今日起，凡棉紗之交易，必須在棉紗業公會市塲中成交。如在塲外拋紗，一槪作爲違法論，並決依法嚴辦。。紗廠之自動出口者，必須經詳盡之登記，並須有相常之限期，若逾期未運出者，一律作爲囤積論。</p>

<h3>華股人心暗淡　賣風所向披靡</h3>
<p>華股昨初開以宋院長發表對國產工商業有貸款之舉，人心稍振，上傷即開高盤，惟高價時獲利多方，一致傾出，不久反漲爲跌，一五一號二二九號一七二號二一八號均陸續有售，開後即吿步跌，十時後八九號等有補，一九八號仍售，低後轉呈盤局，無何交易見稀，人心悲觀，檯面帮紛售，惟十一時後仍有掙扎，一四五號一八四號等紛售之下，籌碼終吿鬆動，現永紗一度跌至六〇〇元關口，入後補空轉股，一四三號一五五號一六二號廣帮有納，臨收時在六一〇元內外掙扎，結果較上週六熟股計永紗美亞信和景福新光各跌百分之二迄百分之四，勤興獨跌百分之七，冷股麗安大通微升，內衣華豐平平，餘均微跌至一成弱不等。遞交一致下跌，午後上塲時之短時平穩，不久即因一五一號三八號一四五號二三三一號連袂售出而被壓迫下游。六百元之現永紗，終被打破。低後苒轉徘徊，結果較上週六熱股計永紗信和景福新光各跌半成光景，美亞勤興各跌百分之七，冷股大通獨漲一成半，火柴跌一成，　安微升，餘者均吿微跌至半成不等。遞交除永公無從統計外，均跌半成左右。塲外各股亦稍疲落。</p>

<h3>細紗超過四百萬　配貨不夠現貨籌碼枯竭　龍頭做到九萬二千五百</h3>
<p>棉紗昨日黑市漲風更見擴大，據聞紡管會配售各廠之紗量，實際用途均感短絀，故不得不向黑市搜購，是以市上現貨籌碼枯竭，而求戶殷切，市價步漲，尤以四十二支細紗之漲勢最爲驚人，每件由三八〇萬破四〇〇萬元大關創空前高峯</p>
<p>布市漲風，已不若上週之猛，搜進各戶，吐售者甚多，價格較週六略高，龍頭現貨做九萬二千五百元，藍鷄九萬一千元，四君子　嘰九萬八千元，各種色布，則仍站定原盤，大陸士林十三萬五千元。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕燒碱市面，近越常軌，實不免有投機作風在內，以至市價一天數變，與黃金美鈔一般，據業中人云，上週由歐美及合灣遝滬之貨，的四百餘桶，該貨尙在報關，的十天當可提貨，市面有人拋售，其價爲一百零五萬元，現貨交易甚稀，硫化碱白蠟亦有到貨。</p>
<h3>汕頭青步跌</h3>
<p>昨　市如靑糖以汕帮傾向售出，以致急遽下降，跌度近萬元，其他亦被帶小，惟台糖以現貨尙缺，仍能穩定，公會劃盤現貨中砂自十四萬三千元，生砂赤十二萬二千元，汕帮開出黃崗靑竟破十萬大關僅九萬八千元至五六七千元，棉赤十一萬九千元，厚片靑八萬五千元，祝靑九萬七千元，興化赤十二萬二三千元，中莊興化自十三萬六七千元，統共成交三百件弱。</p>

<h3>食油配售開始　門市每斤一千二百元　油價審議會暫緩召開</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海食油零售業醬園業及醬酒菜三同業公會合組之「上海食油聯合配銷辦事處，昨已正式辦公；會員前往登記者，共達一千餘家。在評價未調整前，所有上海食油零售商，均須遵社會局限價，門莊每斤一千二百元，菜油豆油一律。昨日民營廠配出食油共四百担，其分配比例係：大有餘廠一百廿八祖，大昌新八十担，長德五十二担，順餘四十八担，大生十六担，爲民十二祖，以上均係豆油，大德新則配出菜油六十四担。配與一百十五家，（虹口區）每家一桶，計合三担半。其餘各家，因時間關係，將於今日繼續配售云。至調整售價，將視成本如何而定，現植物油廠成太會計已送交社會局，其他民營油廠尙未送到，故油價審議會決暫緩召開。</p>

<h3>人造絲　黑市復活之原因　配貨花色不全數量不足</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕人造絲前因來源斷絕，市上存貨日枯，以致市價一度高翔，幾成漫無止境之局面，自日本人造絲來滬，由中央信託局負責辦理配售事宜，以絲織廠及針織業爲配售對象，各廠商向中信局由請登記實警數量，經核准後按月分八次配售，於是黑市幾成死市，市價跌落與最高價相較幾達半數，此不得不歸功於配售之辦理得宜，不料最近黑市竟又死灰復燃，推究其因，仍不外配售量不足，實銷商仍須向黑市購進所致，然各廠由請登記實需數量，已由中信局核准配售，何故尙有不足，前報諉諸一部份廠商作繭自縛，自己造成，實亦似是而非，緣甲廠假定有織綢機十台，申請登記每月需人造絲八大箱，其中五箱，需一二〇號有光，二箱一二〇號半光，一箱七五號半光，但目前中信局所配售者，盡是一二〇號有光，對於甲廠之申請配售數量，按照有光配售，每月只有五箱可得，其三箱半光，付之缺如，則甲廠每月不敷之數，除仍向黑市搜購外，並無他法，倘配售機關能依照廠商申請總數配售，即申請半光或無光者，亦以有光抵冲之，則各廠原須用半光或無光者，可設法改造，儘量利用有光，則黑市自無復活之機會矣。</p>
<h3>紐約日絲跌價</h3>

<p>據中　消息，關於撥發該公司收購之另戶乾繭，交由江浙民營絲廠代繅，以資接濟一事，經該公司與繅絲公會治商，決定數額爲四千担，凡屬能繅製優級生絲之民營絲廠，均可代繅，正向該公司辦理申請中。</p>

<h3>豫南「土皇帝」入獄</h3>
<p>— 本報開封記者王瘦梅</p>
<p>十三日航訊</p>
<p>馳名豫南的「商城王」顧瑩，被河南省政府免職扣押了，這好像一隻猛虎被捉進了籠子裏。</p>
<p>商城，八年來被死的恐怖籠罩着，早已經失去了光明和正義，沒有了公理和法律，變成了另一個世界，而這個世界的主人，就是恐怖製造者的顧瑩。</p>
<p>「土皇帝」顧榮的產生，據商城人說：「顧瑩在「功業」上只有三個恩人：一個是軍閥，一個是共產黨，另一個便是日寇。」那就是說眾閥，共產黨和日寇造成了他特殊的環境，使他在用恐怖征服了商城之後，便成「商城王」。</p>
<p>軍政大權　集於一身</p>
<p>顧烾，頭腦簡單，毫無常識，一個十足的「土豹子」。他沒有讀過什麼軍事政治會籍，也沒有看過公文卷宗，他的字典中只有一個「殺」字。他是以紅槍會起家的，遠在抗戰以前，他在某軍閥庇護支持之下，在商城新生鄉一帶組織紅槍會，糾合地方武力，集土匪流氓於一團，某軍閥是想利川他擴充自己的實力，他是想借這個機會奠定武力征服商城的基礎，不久，他已擁有相當雄厚的武力了。</p>
<p>抗戰初期，因我軍事失利，在暴的敵人，於佔領京滬之後，沿江西進，武漢情勢岌岌可危，爲佈置保衛大武漢，白副總長對大別山門戶的商城十分注意，因爲商城如淪陷，敵人即可越火別山而直逼武漢。因爲商城在戰略上佔了重要地位，速着商城的地方武力，也被重視了，而當時在商城擁有雄厚武力的顧瑩，正是態度曖昧，白氏以爲這支武力，無謚如何要應用在自衛衛國的正道上去，否則這支武力不投敵，必投奸，因此，顧瑩就被任爲　擊司令兼商城縣長，集軍政火權於一身，這給他以大展「抱負」的好機會。</p>
<p>他掌握了商城眾政火權之後，立刻決定了兩種作風：一個是以屠殺製造恐怖，以恐怖達成征服統治的目的。一個是加强商城的特殊化，造成上峯遷就環境的心理，藉以鞏固自己的軍政地位。他的這種作風竟成功了，他在商城的軍事政治地位，一直在這種作風下保持到被扣爲止。省當局對商城的眞實情形，也是在最　才弄淸楚。</p>
<p>兒子被顧縣長殺掉　家長反設宴道歉</p>
<p>在他那種可怕的作風下，他却製造了些什麽罪惡呢？商城三十萬民衆可以吿訴大家：</p>
<p>他好殺，用殺來立威，用殺來消滅異已，凡是與他有仇恨的他就要殺，凡是不服從他的，他也要殺，七八年來，在他的屠刀下被殺掉的著名正紳，計有洪襄卿，梅友香，胡顯閣等，其餘或全家被他活埋，或個人被他暗殺的，簡直不能以數計。三十二年十一月間，商城省立信陽師範分校學生因細故發生風潮，顧瑩以縣長地位去維持校務，到校後在總理紀念週中，暗示打手將該校好學生飽其福當塲槍斃，全校師生譁然，此事發生後第三天，記者適因公抵該縣，聞之駭然，但聽不到一個人對此案發表意見，記者曾經再三問過他們，但沒有一個人敢說一句話。更奇怪的是，死者家長反到城內備酒席請顧縣長吃酒，在酒席上正式向顧縣長表示道歉：「小兒該死，請縣長不要生氣，不要和我們計較……」顧瑩的兇惡和被征服下的民衆的可憐悲慘，由此可見一斑了。</p>
<p>記得當記者那次和道「土皇帝」會的時候，他曾坦直而得意的吿訴記者說：「商城的事情很好辦，我的命令下去，說到那里，辦到那里，他們大家都知道我的脾氣，他們不服從我，就不客氣。比如禁止賭博，我光貼個條子，寫上四個字：「禁止賭博」，然後商城境內，如發現再有人在賭，我的便衣隊就乾脆向他們投一個炸彈，使他們都回老家去。（他說到這里，張開了大嘴，發出得意而可怕的笑聲，好像空谷虎嘯一樣，使人毛骨悚然。）還有處置妓女，記得有一天早上，我忽然想起妓女要不得，立刻下命令，限妓女即日離境，如到天黑再在商城縣境內發見妓女，那就是活埋，妓女不能跑路嗎？哼，那是不到時候，記得那天，命令一下，她們連行李都不顧，就拼命爭着趕路，到天黑，沒有一個不跑在距城一百二十里的縣境以外。</p>
<p>殺人魔王的話</p>
<p>「三歲的小孩也要殺　留着他將來殺我嗎」</p>
<p>他的刑法種類甚多，亦甚酷，不關刑事民事，不問案情輕重：他都要呌他們領敎領敎他的厲害。聽說該縣西鄕，某姓因與人發生田產糾紛，不知怎的，動了他的虎怒，他就把那家全家人活埋了，最後只剩一個三歲小孩，他的衛士們見狀甚慘，不忍再埋，顧瑩大怒道：「斬草必需除根，留這小畜牲將來殺我嗎？」於是他自已動手，扒了個坑，將這小孩也埋了。在商城，吸紙烟，賣紙烟都犯法，有一周姓因賣紙烟，被顧瑩用電刑處決了。</p>
<p>老百姓悲憤語</p>
<p>「司令不死我工不止」</p>
<p>顧瑩身體健壯。他有三個姨太太。這三個都是從人家搶來的姨太太，分在新生鄉的蔡塘子，四方窪，沈家畈三千地方居住着，他很懂得享受，他知道金屋藏嬌，他徵工徵料，在這三個地方大興土木，建筑華麗而堂皇的居室，合計華屋一千餘間，聽說華屋的墻壁都是用美麗的花石條砌起來的，墻的厚度竟達三公尺據說迫擊砲打不透。爲了建屋需要花石條，就在險峻的懸崖中開了一條十一里長的馬路，那些被征調的老百姓，不敢說不願意，現在仍然在老老實實的爲顧塋做工，可是在那里也有個諺語：「司令不死，我工不止。」這諺語，人人心里記得，人人口里說不得。　多年的司令兼縣長，他已成了個驚人的財主了。他現在已有良田一萬八千畝。他的財富，當然是由橫征暴歛而來，商城的民衆，每年除了完納正糧之外，顧瑩以辦敎育爲名，又向他們每石再抽四斗至七斗，（每斗三十斤）名曰「寄稻莊」，春季每石又抽麥二斗至三斗，除百分之一二辦學外，其餘的就無人敢査問了，速年天災掀收，百姓一天天瘦下去，顧瑩却一天胖似一天！</p>
<p>上級的例行公文，在他這里向來是不被重視的，他的縣府秘書拿一個他的紅色印泥岡章，天天在蓋那些「等因奉此」的例行公事，下級看到這些公文，也一樣的往架子上一擺，不管是天大的事，也就算了。他另外有一個自己用的藍色印泥的圖單他如果下命令，就用這個圖章，下級人員一看到籃色圖章的手諭，那就不折不扣，不眠不休的要貫澈這個命令，稍有玩忽，他們就會得到不可想像的結局。</p>
<p>他那種剛愎頑固的態度，是很少見的記得那次他和記者談話時，他這樣說：「俺（商城方言，就是我的意思）沒讀過三民主義，俺也不管三民主義不三民主義，俺就是這樣幹法，俺也不管人家批評不批評，俺有俺的主意。」這樣剛愎自用的人物，在目前的行政人員中能找到幾個？</p>
<p>上次全省開行政會議，事前好多人想着他不會到省參加，也有好多人希望瞻仰一下這個殺人的魔王。誰知他竟然帶着三蔴袋鈔票來了。他到開封後，盡量想把那些鈔票送給能替他帮忙的要人們，因爲他知道商城那些被征服的奴隸們的吼聲，已經震動開封了。</p>
<p>河南省政府當局，在當時對此案始終保持沉默，這沉默引起了商城人的不安，也引起了輿論界的注意，此間各報都以顯著地位，刊載這個「土皇帝」的罪行。</p>
<p>沉着果　的劉主席，畢竟抱着澄淸吏治的決心，行政會議剛閉幕，他就不動聲色的手令將顧瑩免職，並飭省會警察局將顧瑩免職扣押了。</p>
<p>這消息傳出來，人心大快轟動一時。尤其那些商城人興奮得幾乎跳起來。</p>
<p>現在顧塋被扣起已經好久了，並且早已由省會警察局移交法院訊辦，但商城人興奮的面影中似乎又添上一絲疑慮，因爲法院遲遲不宣判，他們恐怕法院給這個殺人魔王的顧瑩判一個三年二年的徒刑，顧瑩一交保蹬金，又復如虎出柙，放虎歸山，那將使商城人不堪設想。他們並不是過慮，此間社會人士，也正爲這個問題替商城人揑一把汗。</p>
<p>豫魯監察使署在前幾天已對顧塋案提出了糾舉書，社會人士讀了那糾舉書，人人爲之髪指，人人都主張趕快刺死這隻老虎，但承辦比案的開封地方法院，他有他的步驟，他不能在證據未完全獲到以前，如一般人想像那樣乾脆的馬上就把顧瑩結果。</p>
<p>今天這里的河南民報和中國時報上登載了這樣一個消息：「中央社訊，前商城縣長顧瑩，經該縣人士吿發後，豫魯監察使署派員到商月餘，查獲貪汚違法案件數十起，皆取得確證，提起糾舉，引起社會憤慨，據聞省府亦同時派幹員蒞商調査，又搜集鐵證多件，調査報吿書洋洋五六萬言，皆由有關之應處簽註意見，已將卷證移交開封地方法院併案檢舉，其中如草菅人命，貪污數字，盜用國防器材，截擊三十九軍等項，更屬無法無天，駭人聽聞，且所査各項多半爲該縣吿發人所未曾揭舉者，現聞該縣吿發人復根據事實向開封地院補請依法起訴。」</p>
<p>這個消息發表後，社會人士都伸長郣子，期望着這個亂世魔王的末日之到臨，連顧瑩屠刀下的那些寃魂，也日夜在開封地方法院門前候着消息！</p>

<h3>新疆透視</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>確保西陲門戶</p>
<p>記者駕駛吉普卡在新疆天山以南的古代沙漠隊商的漫漫長途上作數天的巡禮以後，對於這中古時代的回教文明的政治經濟現勢，自　能作正雍的記述。這一個經濟體系形成了廣大無垠的荒漠中的小小活壞，自從一九三三年盛世才僭立新省以來，實際上已和現代世界隔絕。今則在新任省主席張治中將軍治下，新疆已踏上了復興大道。</p>
<p>一九四五年八月廿六日，正當伊寗叛變高潮時期，由回敎徒，烏伊格人，烏茲倍克人，塔奇克人，和寇爾吉茲人混合組成之軍隊攻佔備犁。（新疆省南部的要塞並爲通達阿富汗，蘇聯和印度的門戶。）該城被叛黨一萬三千人佔領，至七月一日始遵照六月六日在迪化簽訂的條約，交還中國軍隊。其後，大批國軍源源開入新省南部，駐重兵於吐魯番，庫軍，阿克蘇，疏勒，蒲犁，莎車等要城。</p>
<p>據中國非官方人士稱：蘇聯對新疆土人作生動的反華宣傳，此項宣傳，因俄貨的充斥於土人市塲而隨之增强。這是可能的事，但須知隣近蘇聯各共和國的回敎民族，與新疆回民血統相同，政治上的畛域對於他們不是十分重要的。記者與新疆回民領袖相處半月，始終不能察出這些邊疆民族有絲亳共產主議傾向。反之，他們對中國共產黨却表示厭惡。</p>
<p>據烏伊格族人稱：駐紥於新省南部的國軍已近十萬人，目前仍在繼續增加。新疆當局不願透露駐軍的實在數目。數月前，因張主席廢除捐稅及釋放政治犯的德政而挽回了土人對國民政府的信心，現在，道信心已經隨着國軍的大量增加而開始動搖了。土人領袖發出呼籲，謂維持地方治安或防衛外國侵掠，無需乎大量的軍隊，此等軍隊，消費巨額的食糧，徒然增重地方的經濟負祖。據悉：回民已呈請張主席將浩大的軍費移用於發展灌漑及公路之需，以便推銷穀物，水果，氈毯，皮革，雖皮等貨物。　突厥族烏伊格人，至少佔新省四百萬人口中的百分之七十五，其餘除各大城市中的行政官，店主及技師等「外鄕」華人的十五萬人外，均爲回敎徒。這些回敎徒，在種族和宗敎上素來團結一致，最近因伊寗叛變而益形堅强。新省工人依據迪化條約規定，現正辦理省議會及縣議會代表選舉。</p>
<p>回民叛黨現已完全控制新疆省的西北最當饒之區，國民政府則控制着南都沃壤密佈的廣大地域，該處居民同樣享有自治權，但缺乏水，道路和衣服。</p>
<p>如果國民政府方面能予張治中以必要的支援，同時伊　叛亂政府能允許他取得瑪那斯河以西的石油，煤等資源，那麽盛世才暴政所造成的可恥的局面，張氏當能加以矯正。如果張氏能滿足沙漠牧民和沃壞農民的最簡單的需要，並解除他們給養大隊駐軍的重負，那麽，發生於新疆南部的騷亂，當即可以敉平。</p>
<p>新疆南部沃壞的黃土盛產小麥，甘蔗，粟，瓜，玉蜀黍，葡萄，和蘋菓。在山麓的草地上放牧着成千累萬的牛羊和馬。</p>
<p>在新疆省建築一條橫　全省的現代公路，可使貧乏的新省繁榮起來，同時可以確保中國西陲的門戶。</p>

<h3>星期論壇　公共衛生是一種戰爭</h3>
<p>— 周尙</p>
<p>爲全國公共衛生行政會議以後而作</p>
<p>抗戰是一個偉大的改造家。個人的利益是附屬於公衆的需要。在抗職過程巾爭取勝利時，我們男男女女爲公衆和益而議牲。抗戰結束了，勝利的簡單目的消失了。而新目的新目標必須要找尋。這裏有一個目的是毫無疑義的必須要選擇的，這目的便是健康。爲健康而戰，爲健康而聯合各地方人士作共同而戰。這是影響我們每個人的生命和全體的幸福。這個戰爭每個人該參加一部份。</p>
<p>公共衛生是科學，是藝術，同時也是一種戰爭，全世界所有國家都該參加這種戰爭而成爲聯合國。它的敵人有時爲一個細菌或濾過性毒，有時爲一隻　一隻　，有時爲一頭蒼蠅或一頭蚊蟲，一隻犬或一隻老鼠。有時爲一種無生命的化學物質。有時爲人類腦和手的產物。有時却爲我們自己。</p>
<p>公共衛生的戰爭，不但在醫院和實騐室，不但在病人的床邊。它的戰塲是在參政會，在行政院，在工廠，在礦穴，在生食物的野外，在囊食物的店舖，在廚房，在洗衣處，在學校，在家庭。當下水道壞了，垃圾堆積了，汚物中的敵人出現了，戰爭便進行了。衛生的敵人太多，防不勝防，所以我們要時時刻刻提心吊膽準備小打火戰。</p>
<p>這個戰略目的是簡單而淸楚，可能的戰衛路綫却很多，目前中國打這個仗，緊急應戰的路綫似有下列幾條：（一）骯綠，（二）無智，（三）貧窮</p>
<p>第一條戰綫是與骯髒作陣地的正面戰：</p>
<p>我國衛生最成問題的是骯髒。骯髒蹧踢了人命，骯髒減弱了國力，骯髒損毀了道德，骯髒降低了國格。我們每天在不潔中過日子，隨地小便，隨地吐痰。死猫死鼠，殘渣垃圾，禽獸魚骨，菜果皮穀，都是以大街爲歸宿，內地城市像泥菩薩一蹲一蹲的排着大的小的碎的好的糞缸，一壁淘米，洗菜，一壁洗便桶倒夜　。馬牛羊鷄犬豕與人同居對臥，野蠻時代遺留下來的，「有雨一街泥，無風三尺土」的街夾着一匹一匹的猪玀與人爭先恐後的競走。國際觀瞻的大都市，下水道的會街倒多少房子，市區心臟，竟讓它污水長流，臭氣沖天。四周都佈滿着垃圾堆，死東西，讓細菌自由繁殖散播。五月間上海的垃圾一積便是一二·〇〇〇噸，怎樣會不使安身託命的百萬市民不寒而慄。</p>
<p>個人方面癩痢頭，爛眼睛，膿皰瘡，癩疥瘡等等一年四季盛行於大小社會。身　，頭　，跳蝨，臭蟲，蚊子，蒼蠅，何止恒河沙數。金黃的牙齒，滿面的鬚子，長毛的頭髮，黑漆的頸項，油膩的衣衫，人面前手指挖鼻孔，搔大腿，鼻涕再送到門邊　底。　子在身上整天擾扒，捉到了不慌不忙向嘴裏一送，唇齒間便嘖嘖不止，雷特洛甫博士（Dr.　Rocloff）親見他的繼導在一分鐘內捉到八十九個。</p>
<p>現在我們急需普遍建立自來水制度。日本式的公共浴室，舉行淸潔運動，刷牙運動，同時下鄕建溝渠。波毛意（L.Bonmer）敎授謂「一道溝渠之於鄕村其對鄕村的利益可與國家之開闢巴拿馬或蘇彝士運河相比擬。』衛生工程實是這稀戰爭的主力步隊。但我國習衛生工程者少如鳳毛麟角，此次衛生行政會議有設置衛生工程獎學金案是値得提倡的。</p>
<p>第二要與無智作左翼的側擊戰，無智是愚蠢，愚蠢最易壤事。各式各樣壞事一半是有智識聰明人明知過犯，一半是無智識笨人無意造成的。衛生上的壞事是由無智所釀成。迷信是健康的死對頭，迷信來自愚蠢。我們因爲敎育落後，衛生智識不普及，處此原始時代，視病仍爲惡魔所虐，求神問卜，依然未　渡過耶穌紀元前一二，〇〇〇年石器時代，不知害了多少大小生命。危及了民族生物基礎，動搖了建設國家基本。我們該用衛生敎育這支軍隊應戰。勝利後第一次全國衛生行政會議在保健業務組中議決了加强衛生宣傳，和設置科學術生敎育宣傳機稱兩案。這是衛生的先頭步隊，用以啓發民智不可少的方法。</p>
<p>哈佛大學公共衛生敎授施梅爾（Wilson　G.　Smillie）對於控制瘧疾強調敎育政策的重要，他說：「控制瘧疾方案是不能成功的，除非人民充分明白這病傳染的道理和預防的方法」。實施學校衛生敎育和民衆衛生敎育之前，醫師護士該先懂得衛生敎育，這倒不是知識問題，而是一種態度問題。我們今日有醫事人員三〇二八九名，其中醫師一三四〇人，護士五九九七，希望他們聯合着全國敎員做衛生大使和衛生敎師。我們必須敎育兒童未出世前的母親，我們必須教育她在分娩時期；分娩後我們必敎育母親和兒童兩方；我們必須敎育兒童自嬰兒時期進學校，敎育在學校時期，教育出學校而入社會工作時期，然後在成人時期不時的復敎育。牢記，我們沒有足够的醫師和護士療治疾病，讓他們健康吧。</p>
<p>這功課是簡單的。淸潔新鮮空氣，良好的食物，努力工作，充分休息，有假日，合理而不迷信，科學而不信命運，我們必須找出人民知道的什麽，他們怎樣的學習，他們無智到怎麽程度，我們必須在學校，在家庭，在播音台，影片，標語，報紙，敎育他們。</p>
<p>第三個右翼的戰塲開闢在貧窮方面：貧窮是健康的大敵人·貧窮的原因是疾病·失業·年老及大家庭。逍些問題都與貧窮成了互爲因果，人家身體强精神足一切生產勝過我們，我們就將一面倒的傾銷人家的東西，我們勝利後一聽出口貿易失敗而造成失業；因失業而轉業是內政計劃與組織的壞現象。我們因不健康易衰易老，不但不能生產還要銷費，一進一出，相差自大。大家庭中，多疲　殘疾，生之者寡，食之者衆，安能不貧不窮？</p>
<p>貧窮在病時得不到她當的醫療，和調養，不該死而寃枉死的不知其數。貧窮在平時，住擁擠的房屋，地狹人稠，疾病滋生，吃的是一瓢飲一簞食，那得不搜死餓死。勝利後房荒得可怕，物價如野馬般的奔跳，優秀國民不免受反淘汰，反選擇的急流中淹歿。</p>
<p>人民應在合理租價上有適當的住宅，國家應該有治標治本的好計劃，更需要掃除貧民窟。至於食物人人應有適當的質量，尤其是孕母，乳母，五歲以下嬰兒和學校兒童却需要一等的好養料，這意思是給他們以充足的維生素高等的蛋白質和礦物質，道不是浪費，乃是需要，我們如此的窮不能免費給予，至少要廉價供給，這需要控制食物價格，必要時，須補充食物生產，這是國家食物計劃，控制市塲和分配，使錢必定做人的僕人，絕對絕對不讓錢做主人。</p>
<p>我國公共衛生本身已經貧血，無錢滋養。自一九四〇年至今年國家歲出總預算（以千元爲單位）二·九一五·六二一·五六〇·衛生經費支出爲三·六六八·八四五·佔〇·一二六，即國家用去一千境錢中辦衛生的只有一百二十六元。請看英印二國情况如何：</p>
<p>英國一九三四－三五年　印度一九三一－三二年</p>
<p>全國人口　四六·六八〇·〇〇〇　二七一·五八〇·〇〇〇</p>
<p>全國收入</p>
<p>英鎊　三·七〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇　慮比　一六·八九〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇</p>
<p>國幣　五九·二〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇　國幣　二一·一一二·五〇〇·〇〇〇</p>
<p>醫事費用</p>
<p>英鎊　七五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇　慮比　四〇·八〇〇·〇〇〇</p>
<p>國幣　一·二〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇　國幣　五一〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇</p>
<p>醫事費用佔政府總支出百分數　七·九七　一·八五</p>
<p>公共衛生費</p>
<p>英鎊　二七·〇〇〇·〇〇〇　慮比　一七·四〇〇·〇〇〇</p>
<p>國幣　一·八七二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇　國幣　二〇·七五〇·〇〇〇</p>
<p>公共衛生費佔政府總支出百分數　一二·四三〇　〇·七九</p>
<p>我們與他們比較不免愧急，對英國固望塵莫及，連得印度也相形見拙，西洋有一句話，「公共衛生是買來的」，（Pubiec　Health　is.　Purchasable）我們今日有這樣的公共衛生，若以金額與成績來比較，已算是大吿成功了。曩昔「朕即國家」時代，國家預算是量入爲出，今日民主時代，應該是量出爲入，前者有多少錢做多少事，後者是要做多少事去拿多少錢。公共衛生事屬性命交關，貧窮的老百姓一定肯拿出這筆錢來的。</p>
<p>這種戰爭不獨是衛生家和醫師的職責，道是我們大家的職責。我們知道目的，我們有戰略，只要把我們的意志聯合着所有我們的力量，我們便能打勝仗。（三五，十一，八於首都）</p>

<h3>母教</h3>
<p>— 金燮山</p>
<p>……要知二十年後的孩子　且看今日的母親！</p>
<p>我們不難從歷史中找出若干偉大的人物都受母親的重大影響，因而能推進社會，爲國家民族增光榮；但同時我們也可以看到若干不肖子，未始不與母敎有重大的關係。</p>
<p>古書中是這樣說：「養不敎，父之過，敎不嚴，師之惰。」好像孩子一切不良行爲的造成與母親無關。敎是應當父親來敎的，但試問目今的社會制度下，做一個父親的能有多少時間來教育孩子？我這意思並不是想推卸一切爲父者的責任，不過說明爲父者可能敎育孩子的時間太少而已——而母親差不多可以說是整天陪伴着孩子的。即使是一個學齡孩童的母親，她可能與孩子接觸的時間也總要比做父親的多得多。而且母親的溫慈與父親的嚴峻，孩子的喜歡親近何人，也是自然的結果了。（親近即就可以自然灌輸敎育的機會。）我們不能武斷地說溫慈不足以敎育孩子，那末母親敎養孩子責任的重大，也於此可見。</p>
<p>女子的責任旣是這樣重要，可是我們張開眼來瞧瞧，現在正在敬着母親的一些人羣吧！</p>
<p>並不須要怎樣統計，我們可　知道大多數的吾國婦女還是陷於文盲的苦境中。勉們缺乏智識無淸新頭腦；高等的從打牌中消磨她們的歲月，比較次等的，就以搬弄是非來增加生活的熱鬧。邨婦駡街，我們還是可以從上海的幾條里弄中找尋出來。無知，愚蠢，一切不智慧的舉動，還永遠存在於太多數的家庭中。上海最熱鬧的南京路上的一家廟宇內，初一月半還是人仰馬翻，熱鬧非凡，雖然有人說，這其中大多是「生意浪」女人，但仍有不少家庭婦女插足其中。這還不够說出中國婦女敎育前途的悲哀嗎？</p>
<p>婦女敎育前途的悲哀，也即是孩子的悲哀。魯迅先生曾經這樣說過：「要知二十年後的國家，只要看今日的孩子。」但我們不妨說：「要知二十年後的孩子，且看今日的母親！」</p>
<p>母親與孩子接觸時間之多，上面已經說過了。孩子是富於模仿性的。孩子旣與母親接觸時間更多。無疑的，受到母親的影響也一定最大。但許多的母親旣都陷於無敎育的可憐狀態中，能不爲我們的孩子悲，爲我們的國家悲</p>
<p>女子的須要敎育眞是不待言的，而且這呼聲早已喊過了。可是鑒於標準的母親之少，女子敎育的沒有多大成效，現在我們須要急切喊出的口號，是一切婦女均須要再敎育——母親的敎育；怎樣可以做爲一個標準的母親，實在也可以列爲專門的科目呵！假使政府可能辦出一個母親專科學校出來，比起新娘學校，這並不是什麼標新立異的多餘之舉。</p>
<h3>杜魯門女公子隨父在　立城投票（紐約時報攝寄）</h3>
<h3>老小姐</h3>
<p>— 余靜譯自大陸報，陶樂絲狄絲原著</p>
<p>婦女雖達到了解放地位，但仍不能擺脫一個主要的桎梏，就是必須結婚。女子沒有丈夫就是她爲女子失敗的徽號。常然，在從前只有結婚是女子唯一的高尙職業，丈夫與脂粉一般是成爲必需品，丈夫不但是一張吃飯票子，也是社會交際塲所的入座券。女子沒有丈夫，就是沒福氣，被拋棄於幸運門外的黑暗中，那裏是一羣啼哭，悲憤的「剩餘品」</p>
<p>可是今日一切漸漸變遷了，機會之門對於男與女是同等開放的，她們可以選擇任何自己喜歡的職業，個人的賺錢能力是只限制於自己的作事能力。快樂的未婚婦女是人們最歡迎的座上客，然而，普通一般的老小姐，雖是手上也戴着指環，足上也飾着金鍊，她們仍將羞恥於自己手上沒有結婚指環。</p>
<p>如果每張結婚執照都是幸福的證件，你自然很能理解女人爲什麽要追求它；如果一個女子瘋狂地愛着一個男予，你也能理解爲什麽她追求他直至得着他。但是，每年結婚的千千萬萬女子，並沒有上述的任何一個理由使她們肩上結婚的重任。</p>
<p>她們不是偉大熱情的犧牲者，她們不是像詩人所說：「沒有愛，世界就完了。」她們從庸俗的靑年中找尋不到少女夢想的英雄，往往他沒有一些是合乎她們所要求的丈夫，可是她們寗願嫁給所見的唯一的男子，而不能忍受把小姐兩字刻在墓石上的恥辱。</p>
<p>職業婦女結婚並不是基於得到丈夫便能坐了享福的幻象，她能記起鄰座寫字桌的女同事常在法國時裝店買衣裳，而現在她結了婚只有在下等店舖購買，她還常常要帮助她的姊姊付房租，買鞋子給孩子們。</p>
<p>結婚批環的代價是異常的高，而女子仍繼續和它們拉攏，她們即使不是瘋狂地愛着，也去結婚，也許她們自己也不知其所以然。沒有一天我不接到婦女的來信，詢問怎樣和何處去找尋丈夫，或是怎樣從兩個或三個男性中選擇一個，作者對他們中任何一個實在是並無偏向的。</p>
<p>許多婦女旣非爲愛而結婚，亦不希冀結了婚能過舒適生活，而如此堅決的要結婚，是任何人所不能理解的，我的意見以爲她們仍是傳統桎梏的犧牲者，寗可人家稱呼一聲太太，而不要呌老小姐。</p>
<h3>奶媽</h3>
<p>— 燕影</p>
<p>在紙醉金迷的上海，有錢的太太迷戀於物質的亨受，爲了避免哺育的麻煩，於是大都僱用奶媽來代勞。做母親的根本沒想到利多還是害多，加以虛榮心的作祟，僱用奶媽也就成爲富家的一種標幟。</p>
<p>其次是一般職業婦女，爲了她們自身的職菜。不得不把哺乳的責任交給奶媽，她們的動機未必不純正，伹是在得失利害的權衡下，再顧到兒女精神上的修養，恐怕還是得不償失的多。</p>
<p>母愛是偉大的，母親應在撫育敎養的過程中給予精神上薰淘，在兒女的小心靈中就建築下修養之路，然而僱用了奶媽，母愛的灌輸旣失去了很多的機會，而僱用的奶媽又常給小主人以不應有的放肆，於是就形成了溺愛或放肆的客觀環境。還有，奶媽大都來自貧苦的人家，她們爲了工作和衛生方面的限制，很少有健全的體格，更危險的或者有潛伏的傳染病，而且禹魯的腦筋，也可能影響到小孩我們常可看到許多精明的父母，而他的孩子却粗變得很，往往是這個原因。</p>
<p>總之，從各方面看來，僱用奶媽是最不値得的事。爲家庭的幸福，兒女的前途，我們除非爲了本身生病等等的不得已，應該摒絕僱用奶媽的惡習。</p>
<h3>羢綫的判別</h3>
<p>— 費文</p>
<p>購買時必須比較硏究</p>
<p>羢綫已經成爲家家必用的衣着必需品，因爲它的優點是柔軟，溫暖，輕巧，在穿過以後，又可以拆開洗滌重做。</p>
<p>這裏是幾個判別羢綫優劣的方法，在購買羢綫時，可以利用：</p>
<p>（一）柔軟的測騐：我們拿起羢綫，可以放在鼻部或面頰上，品質優良的羢綫，會產生一種溫暖柔和的感覺，品質低劣的羢綫，就有一種生硬之感。</p>
<p>（二）拉力測騐：我們拉開一絞羢綫，用力地拉，品質優良的羢綫，可以拉得較長且非常自然。</p>
<p>（三）彈注測騐，彈性對於絨綫是一個必要條件，因爲沒有彈性，結成的羢綫衫就根本不會柔軟，要試騐彈性，可以拿出一根用兩手拉長，品質優美的羢綫彈性很大，品質低劣的羢綫，彈性很小。</p>
<p>最近上發現有所謂澳洲羢綫者，其實是上海的非正式羢綫廠所製造的，無非貼上一個冒牌的商標而已，購買羢錢時不可不知。</p>
<h3>糊火柴盒</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>村婦的副業</p>
<p>談到農村婦女的副業，這也是關心婦女生活者，値得注意的一件事。就我所知道的農村婦女的副業，如滬郊的閔行，周浦，川沙，南橋等處，她們在農忙之餘，大都以糊製火柴盒，爲唯一的副業。據調查所得：目前農村中的婦女，每大假如糊製火柴盒一千隻，那末，它的酬報，僅僅是法幣八百元，而且，糊製火柴盒的原料，—漿糊，也要自備的。手法敏捷的婦女，自平至暮，充其極，每天可以糊製火柴盒五千隻，所得到的酬報，也祗是法幣四千元而已。在生活如此高昂的情况之下，一個農村婦女，如果要以糊製火柴盒的收入，來維持一家三四口的生活，無論如何，是一件不可能的事。</p>
<p>據熟悉火柴製盒業的朋友說：以糊製火柴爲副業的農村婦女，澈底的說來，她們實在也是可憐的被剝削者。因爲在目前，滬郊各鄕鎭上的該業主持者，他們向上海各火柴廠中所取得的酬報，決不會這樣的菲薄；然而，他們却利用一般農村婦女農暇中無事可爲的弱點，來剝削她們，以肥一己，這確乎是一件不合情理不合人道的事。</p>
<p>所以，怎樣提倡農村婦女正當的副業，以改善她們的生活，這是目前婦女界，以及關心婦女問題的人士們，所不該忽視的一件事實。</p>
<h3>後母心</h3>
<p>— 鳳</p>
<p>我的結婚，是在二三年前的一個秋天，那時候我已經三十歲了。照一般世俗的眼光看起來，那並不是一個理想圓滿的婚姻，因爲我也免不了因年齡的老大而祗得受做塡房的委曲，而且丈夫的前妻還遺下了一個四歲的孩子！</p>
<p>可是事實上我不失望，並不以作填房爲不圓滿的婚姻，也不因前妻留下個費人手脚的孩子而怨恨。我祗懷了一個信念和決心：我一定要使我的婚姻幸福，我一定要打陂以往遺留下來後母卑視虐待前妻孩子的殘暴的成見，我要做一個慈愛的後母！</p>
<p>這不是一個輕而易舉的嘗試，祗少在傳統的觀念下後母已在無形中被定了一個狠毒偏私的面型。在鄰居的耳膜中，在親友的心目中，你的一舉一動都會被他們注意着，批評着。可是爲了愛的驅使，爲了要做一個拔萃的後母，我畢竟負下了這重担！</p>
<p>我們的結婚是愉快的，無論在精神或物質方面。丈夫有着一個良善諄樸的靈魂，是一個溫文能護家的男子，而我的習性也與他相仿，我相信這種婚姻是往往比較完美的一種，因爲我看到許多夫婦間的不安相痛苦都是因爲性格和脾氣的不同，而到了互相不能瞭解的地步。關於這一點，我是幸運的，嚴重的問題就是在他前妻留下的孩子—明的身上了。</p>
<p>我始終記得，在我們結婚後丈夫呌明第一次稱呼我「媽」時的情景。明穿了新的絨綫衣，一隻手握在他爸爸的手掌中慢慢塊跑到我面前來，雖然他爸爸數次的命他喚「媽」，他總是不響，睜着兩隻又圓又大的眼睛，盯着我瞧！最後，他爸爸似乎惱了，說「不呌我不歡喜你了！」他驚了一下，一陣痛苦的陰影在他的臉上掠過，像受了委曲再也忍不住似的倒在他爸爸的懷裏哭了。可憐的孩子，雖還小，可是小小的心靈中已知道了喪失了親母的痛苦，孩子的感情是眞誠的，我爲他所感動，我攙了他的手，把他抱到我的懷中，愛戀似的撫摸着他的柔髮，一面輕輕地溫柔地在他的耳際說；「不要哭，明，我是和你媽媽一樣地歡喜你呢！」沒多久，他止了抽噎，慢慢地抬起了那雙可憐紅紅的淚眼，輕輕地呌了聲「媽！」呌完，又撲在我的懷中！眞摯的感情決不能强制的。我抱了他，體會到他那時候小小的心靈中所特有的感覺，我覺得我是深深地被感動了。我不能使他已經恐懼悲悒的心靈再受摧殘了，我愛他當甚於愛我自己的孩子！</p>
<p>從此以後，我們母子之間的感情是一天比一天的和諧親密，初期的印象往往會給人們留下了一個不可磨滅的痕跡！我愛他！我在空閒的當兒便給他織絨綫衫，他也從不頑皮，從不要買這樣買那樣。晚上當我們一家三口坐着閒談，或聽音樂的時候，他更乖乖地坐在丈夫的膝頭，或躺在我的懷裏，我們的生活更完美了。我知道許多丈夫都爲前妻留下的孩子的命運担憂，當然在他新失人的面前又不敢直說，怕會引起夫婦間的不睦，但想起了前妻，又深深地感到良心上的譴責，那種心靈上的痛苦和不安，是非局外人所能想像到的。而我的丈夫，看到我們之間的那種親密。和睦，我相信，那已成爲過慮了！</p>
<p>一年後，我的孩子出世了，可是我並沒有因此而疏忽了他，反而我感到這時候倘若一有偏私是頂易遭受到物議的。我照料他一如往日，我不願使他因看到他弟弟的被母親愛護而想起了目己沒有母親的辛酸，同是爲了他倆兄弟日後的和睦和親愛，我應該爲他們築下了牢固的義礎！</p>
<p>現在我的孩子已兩歲了，明已漸漸擺出哥哥的樣千，吃的東西總要分一半給弟弟，在我的慈愛中，他們之問已沒有絲毫的界限了！如今每當我聽見明親熱地喚着「弟弟」，或看到他兩手攙手地一同在草地上搖搖擺擺地在玩着的時候，我的心裏就充滿了一種說不出的快活和尉安，但願所有爲母親所遺留下的孩子都會福，我至誠地祝福他們！</p>

<h3>王爾德與美國</h3>
<p>— 王銳</p>
<p>近　海斯基，畢爾孫（Hesketh　Pearson）的新著「奧士卡，王爾德：其生活及其機智」，洋洋洒洒，痛快淋漓，堪稱近年關於天才作家王爾德的一部最完全，最忠實的評傳，書中描述不少關於王爾德的故事，亦簡潔有趣，令人不忍釋手。</p>
<p>其中有一節畢爾孫叙述王爾德旅美的經過，扼要道來，可見一代文豪對於近代最大强國見解之一斑。有人勸蕭伯納遊美，蕭婉謝，也許是受王爾德的影響。王爾德遊美爲時甚暫，其批評，畢爾孫認爲眞是一針見血。天才眞覺的敏銳，一般人看來誠不啻是一種奇跡。</p>
<p>話說王爾德於一八八二年抵美，即作巡廻演講，百老匯戲劇界獻給他一束純結的百合花。他雖不接受而使他的總管家傷盡腦，但是他穿的服裝，極奢華的能事。對於記者們發表的機智談話，使他的巡迴演講獲得輝煌成功。他的公開談話，效果最强，印象最深者，即在紐約碼頭對一個海關職員答問時所說的幾個字，海關職員問道：「你有什麼公開談話宣佈嗎？」他答：「就只有我的天才。」</p>
<p>王爾德旅行美國其用意類乎對馬克吐溫旅行歐洲的一種報復。馬克吐溫旅歐以後發表的印象錄「國外旅行記實」率直嘲笑所謂高級的歐洲文化。王爾德以同樣率直態度嘲笑美國，說美國幾無文化可言。</p>
<p>他說:「在美國，生活是一種主悄無終止的刑罰。」　　「最先使我感到不合理的，就是美國人的習慣，喜歡在靠近壁爐所在，懸掛圖畫。當我理解這　種風習所生的利益時，我始發覺那些畫幅是何等拙劣。」</p>
<p>「美國生意經所形成的一般淺薄傾向，及她對於精神文化所取的不公平態度，係由於這個國家的一種邪行異說使然，就是他們公開承認：在美國要是一個人沒有能力說圓一個謊，他就不配做美國的民族英雄。」</p>
<p>克里格斯維勒縣的知事拍電報給他：「你願意光臨敝邑作美學演講嗎？」</p>
<p>王爾德回電說：「請先把貴縣的縣名加以改變。」</p>
<p>克里格斯維勒這個縣名實在太不美。</p>
<p>哈佛大學學生聽王爾德演講時自穿短褲，胸佩向日葵或百合花。王爾德在講台站穩，調節自己的呼吸，身上穿的却是一件晚禮服。這使孩子們覺得有點兒愚蠢，但是當他說，他「似乎在教室裏看到某種藝術運動的跡象」時，孩子們便笑着向他表示熱烈的敬意。他的一句警語：「諷刺畫是庸俗之流獻給天才的大貢品」却又使全堂學生震驚不置。</p>
<p>王爾德對於作家的一切批評，溫和寬仁，不願意無故戳傷作家的自尊。他的批評最嚴酷的，要算他對美國畫家詹姆斯威塞爾所說的一句話，這畫家雖有相當宏麗的成就，但是個極端的利己主義者。他說：「威塞爾在我看來是大師當中的一個。我敢說威塞爾對於我的意見完全同意。」</p>
<p>這話原很厚道，但是有一次倫敦泰晤士報藝術批評記者評威塞爾畫說，在他看來，這張作品好，那張作品壞，如此而已。</p>
<p>威塞爾心有未甘，說：「親愛的朋友，這不該說這張畫好，那張畫壞。好與壞並是你該用的辭藻。但是你可以說，我喜歡這張，不喜那張，這才是你份內應做的事。現在請你來吃泗——這一定是你很喜歡的。」</p>
<p>「我願我曾說過這樣的話」王爾德豪爽而又快樂地對威塞爾讚揚道。</p>
<p>「你一定能够，奥士卡，你一定能夠。」威塞尔兴高采烈答道。</p>
<p>后来王尔德敉平画家与记者之间的笔战时，说：「威塞爾常以大寫的我字，來拚湊他的藝術作品。」</p>
<p>淺薄者企圖毀壞大文豪的言行也同樣是不客氣的。從紐約到舊金山，許多醉鬼强迫他縱情豪飲。但是每次飲酒，他總把包圍他的人灌得不省人事，並且像死豬一般，他一隻又一隻把他們堆壘進馬車，然後洋洋得意把馬車駛回自己的旅館去。</p>
<p>柯羅拉度的礦工款待他進金鑛的底層遊覽。王爾德很稱讚這些礦工，說他們的服裝在美國是最好的。在礦穴內他對礦工們說：「我們坐下來參加一個宴會，第一道菜是威士奇，第二道也是威士奇，第三道還是威士奇。」礦工們酩酊大醉，昏昏沉沉一覺睡到大天亮，而王爾德這時也許已經在另一個交際塲所侃侃而談，好像參加一個倫敦的茶會似的。</p>
<h3>詩語</h3>
<p>— 賓家</p>
<p>高尚的意志和純潔的靈魂，常常比美的形色與雕琢的詞句，更深刻而長久地令人感動。——詩人的態度永遠是歲　堅忍的。</p>
<h3>波斯的古代藝術</h3>
<p>— 劉獅</p>
<p>波斯即今日的伊朗，在幾百年間，一直是一個詩人的，哲學家的，神秘主義的國家，然而近年以來，大多數人談起波斯的藝術來，莫不及其　子的出產。波斯　子的式樣，雖然盛名不義，但却是不實用。波斯人在基督降生四千年之前，他們早已造作了美麗的模製陶器，以及精巧的織物。波斯位當東西兩半球之間，爲近東文化的中心，在科學上如天文，數學，在藝術上如金屬細工，陶器，都曾有其燦爛的光輝。</p>
<p>波斯的藝術，是波斯人日常生活上的完整的一部。他們富有天才致力於美化他們飲用的碗具，裝綴他們插花用的瓶子，甚至在他們用爲武器的斧鉞之上，也必設法做得十分精緻。其後的至紀元前一〇〇〇年，他們的馬鞍上，也裝置着美麗的靑銅飾品，這些馬鞍的彫刻，是一九二九年在西部波斯的一處墳蒸內發見的。坐騎大抵與主人合葬一墓。女人的屍體，則往往葬殮在一隻大型的瓶裏。</p>
<p>波斯歷史的開始，即心其藝術爲首，在紀元前五五〇年，即已抵達其高峯。在西勒斯大帝（Cyrus　the　Great）及大留士（Darius）統治之下，波斯攻克了尼羅河至愛琴海的全部土地，建設第一個世界帝國。他們在新獲的領土內，建起紀念性的築物，飾以印象深刻的彫塑，塡以彩色的用具。紀元前三三〇年，他們被亞歷山大大帝所征服，乃吸收了古希臘的文化。在九百年之後阿刺伯人侵入，他們在數學及天文學上又獲得了新的槪念。十三世紀，蒙古人進入近東，他們又受了中國大畫家的熏染，但波斯人還是吸收了轉變爲他們自己的東西。他們從中國人學得了新的槪念，在陶器上施用鮮艷的彩色。直至十五世紀，歐洲的藝術，進入文藝復興的盛世，波斯的藝術，又抵達一個興雅和精緻的頂點，爲前所未曾超過的。附圖爲馬鞍上靑銅彫塑之一，爲太陽之神　駕一獅，代表宇宙之力。鑄塑於西歷紀元前一〇〇〇年間。</p>
<h3>詩牌　揚州續夢之六</h3>
<p>— 洪爲法</p>
<p>李斗的揚州畫舫錄中所寫的過去揚州景物，早和春夢一樣的消逝了。可是其中所提到的詩牌，在十五年前，筆者和任二北等人却曾籍此以爲公餘惟一的消遣，也耗去不少的時光。</p>
<p>關於詩牌，在畫舫錄中是這樣記載着：</p>
<p>『诗牌以象牙爲之，方半寸。每人分得數十字或百餘字，凑集成詩，最難工妙。休園筱園最盛。近共傳者：張四科云：「舟棹恐隨風引去，樓台疑是氣噓成。」藥根和尚云：「雨窗話鬼燈先暗，酒肆論　劍忽鳴。」黃北垞云：「流水莫非遷客意，夕陽都是美人魂。」汪容夫云：「葉脫辭窮巷，蓮衰掃半湖。」皆警句也。』</p>
<p>那時任二北正在鎭江主持省立鎭中，筆者也就在那裏工作。閑來談到畫舫錄中的詩牌，很是感到興趣，便也決定製作一戰副來試試。可是如用象牙，我輩不是富有的鹽商，斷不可能。如改用竹子，旣費事也不美觀，結果便偷工减料，用那錶好來印名片的宣紙製作。並且不採方形，改成矩形，每張上寫一個字，簡直和普通人家要的紙牌差不多了。</p>
<p>紙的詩牌製作好了以後，大家多不贊同『每人分得數十字或百餘字，凑集成詩』的辦法，以爲過於呆板，缺少變化。反正呌做「牌」，不如參用打馬將的方法，倒還名符其實，於是更決定了新的牌律：（一）全牌三百字，名詞，動詞，代詞，副詞，介詞等俱備。（二）同局至少二人，至多六人。（三）起牌發牌，均依坐序。（四）首家起十四葉，餘均十三葉。（五）全局同意，得和牌重起。（六）得依序收他人所發之牌。（七）三百葉外，另有白葉若干。每人得留一白葉，代夫任何理想之字，若是得第二葉，必發出。（八）成牌至十字，至多十四字。（九）成牌句法，三言，四言，五言，七言，長短句不拘。（十）成牌之句，如同局之人多數否認者，應暫止成牌，繼續原局。（十一）一人成牌，餘人得就所有，各自成句，依優劣次第錄之。</p>
<p>牌律旣決，牌字也得酌定。最初是由筆者選了一千餘習見的字，經大家一再刪减，剩了三百字。其中名詞最多，動詞形容詞次之，其他詞類最少。經多次實驗的結果，已足速用，也就不再增加。</p>
<p>自此以後，公餘之暇，或留鎭江在鐵甓城頭，或返揚州在平山堂畔，多是一局詩牌。開始時大家手法不熟，聯想不靈，發牌收牌，常會弄巧成拙，費時很多，後來才漸漸的快起來。大約不足一小時，就可完成一局了。每局成牌以後，當時都會記錄下來，也多有可以稱誦的句子，如『煙籠柳綫遙添碧，雨捲江帆亂入樓。』「『可憐一曲桃花扇，都是新亭舊淚痕。』『玉笛低歌閑對酒，夕陽紅葉冷無聲。』『離懷風亂葉，春半一帆遙。』『烟花憐別夢，風葉滿空山。』『流水可憐碧，鶯花又暮春。』……</p>
<p>後來因爲「一二八」國難發生，大家便無雅興要此詩牌，並且不久以後，也就各懷苦悶，萍梗東西。衹是二北在判離以後，還能壓抑着離情，將詩牌的牌律，牌字，以及各局湊成詩句，彙成一冊，油印分寄局中同人，定名爲「葉局新語。」並且在卷首題一絕句：「翻新葉子鬥閑情，從此無聊却有名；最是局中新語好，夕陽紅葉冷無聲。」一附有跋語：「此集旣就，苦無其名，因擬四字，並戲題一絕，無非常局之迷耳。惟　局二字不興，並無舊篇，何日新語，其生造可笑如此。」當時筆者也曾和了一首：『可憐身世寄閑情，撚斷吟　浪博名；一自西風吹雨過，哀蟬落葉總無聲。』過後二北更再行編訂，改稱「喪志錄」，和紙的詩牌一併鉛印問世，謗自然還是「當局之迷。」可是時移世變，至於今日，欲求再聚一地，要着詩牌，消遣世慮，又何從再得，這眞是揚州續夢了！</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　97</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>（前情節略）八年抗戰，我國大後方以及淪陷區內，千百萬英勇的中華兒女，爲了守衛祖國，拿鮮紅的熱血，洒遍了每寸山河。我們收集了這些悲壯的故實，來紀念恢復失土的艱苦。</p>
<p>第一個故實—「七封秘緘」—記革倭寇勾結了歐陸的幾個戰魔，訂定了七紙秘密文件，要蹂躪整個世界，毀滅一切文化。</p>
<p>靑年鶴見玉，從搖籃起到陸大畢業止，純受日本教育。也許由於血統純正，充滿着量片正义感，看不惯倭寇那种破落户作风—奸，掳，烧，刹，放睹，贩毒，敲诈，勒索，種種罪犯行爲。正在起了反感的當口，偶然發見他本人，原是一們中國老同盟同志占繼漢先生的嫡裔。同時又風聞「七封秘緘」的消息，於是利用他在日本參謀本部的職位，徴集同志，組織了十二個秘密電台，要把這「七封秘緘」的內容，設法揭露，來挽回這生靈塗炭的大刦。</p>
<p>在進行秘密工作中，他發現他正愛着一位天驕不羣的東北女兒紀耀羣。因恐墮入情網，躭誤了大計，所以抱着必死的精神，託辭回到本土，投入龍潭虎穴般的黑龍會中，進行探索「七封秘緘」的工作……</p>
<p>第一卷　七封秘緘</p>
<p>第六章　黑龍會中倩影</p>
<p>這裡東京帝國大學相去不遠，斯美大樓的鐘，正嘡嘡的敲完了十二下，表示這時已是午夜，所有的日間工作，應該告一段落了。斯美大樓束行不到幾十步的某種俱樂部，會員已經一批一批走完，只賸下最後一人。他穿着整潔的夜禮服，看樣子不過二十多點年紀，面部輪廓，烘托出一個標準化的美男子；頸顎全部綫條，劃出了沉靜，堅毅；全身肌骨，長得勻亭調和，愈加顯得精力充沛。</p>
<p>他在俱樂部門口，雲母石的台階上出現的當口，早見他的汽車，一部一九三五型的道奇，已經毫無聲息地從左側滑行了過來，停在台階下面。司機下車，開了車門，在那裏侍候着。也舉首瞧了一眼那淸碧的天空，那朗爽的下弦冷月，吩咐他的司機先到上野公園正門去候着，他需要散步一回。司機躬身應了，就把車子開走了。</p>
<p>靑年輕輕噓了一口氣，待車子去得遠了，這才走下台階，似乎欣賞夜色似的，一步一步向東慢慢走着。他的步履極其遲綏，表示已經相當的疲倦；這是因爲他自從前天，經瀋陽飛渡海峽以來，連日連夜，受着秘密的「五級測驗」，不曾好好休息，這時才將所有課題完成。設非他有過人的精力，早應疲乏得不能動彈了，然而他仍舊保留着相當的活力。</p>
<p>他爲什麼要受這「五級測騐」？那衹是一種入會的秘密手續：第一級測騐是個「忠」字。在測騐時，除了六個資望最高的執監委員，用各種不同的問題，反覆探　之外，還有很酷虐的　騐。譬如說，委員問你，「殺人是違犯國法和違反道德的勾當，會中執行委員，命你去殺人，你如實行殺人，那就是故意犯法作惡；如不執行，就是違背會中命令。這個問題，你如何解決？」</p>

<p>現在，大使已回到北平了，閉門謝客，大概是這幾個月太疲勞所致，政協綜合會議南京還在繼續舉行，我們希望大使休息幾天再能回到南京繼續努力。</p>

<h3>吉普正傳</h3>
<p>— 馬葉</p>
<p>（編者按：這篇吉普自述的文字，是以輕鬆的筆法介紹些一常識，不開玩笑。）</p>
<p>我，「吉普」（暫時沿用你們所慎用的名稱吧！），具備充分的事實和理由，對於一切誤解我，蔑視我，咀咒我，和拍我「馬屁」的人們，致送如左之備忘錄，作嚴重的抗議。我，「吉普」具備充分的證據，對「自由談」上屢决刊載關於我的傳記和賈名的自白晝，作如左之補充書。並以「人命爲重」的善意建議書。</p>
<p>辯正</p>
<p>我首先奉命辯正：「吉普」並非我之本名。據我調査所得，「吉普」這兩個方塊字是發源於山城重慶的美國新聞處，這字眼在中國正在「統一地」流行各地，譯音能如此「一成不變」，雖屬難得，但我看來却要不得。「吉普」分明是「Jeep」譯音過來，但我要再度聲明：「Jeep」亦非我之本名，我之全名！</p>
<p>我有一個非常誇躍非常光榮的本名，日：「萬能車」，洋文寫來是「General　Purpose」，因爲我能致力許多種其他車輛所不能的技能，我不祗運載兵員，也輸送傷兵，搬信件，運火器，而且可以作爲獨立的無綫電收發站，軍用電話站，第一步小型救傷車，野戰X光移動站，小型軍用修理廠，……說不情，數不淸。羅斯福總統曾站在我背上閱兵。諾爾曼第難頭我載過第一批士兵登陸上岸；我能睡在B—25型運輸機飛越「世界屋脊」，飛機停落重慶機塲，我就用我自己的四條腿（車輪子）由運輸機上白動的溜下來，立即服務。我可以爬山，也可以涉水，可以飛天，也可以爬地洞。……總之，我有全能，找榮膺「萬能」二字而無愧！</p>
<p>萬能</p>
<p>美國老兵們起初很規矩的稱呼我整個無缺的全名，但後來說我名字拖泥帶水長得一點，因而簡稱爲GP。第二步，GP兩個字母又說念起來不大順口，再變就變成個簡稱作Geep·這正如美國老兵自稱爲GI的一樣，字雖然短了，呌起來却有點親熱。我本名旣然是「萬能車」，所以希望中國友邦人士要簡稱我名字時，就呌作「老萬」吧，「萬」不是「百家姓」之一麼？不呌「老萬」呌</p>
<p>「小萬」也可以，但不要和詩人之要「小曼」相混，切記切記！有人曾建議呌我做「捷」，也頗要得，另立于案存照。</p>
<p>說到我家譜：我是我大家族中一員，全球各地，散佈有我百千萬個同樣臉型同樣身材的兄弟，但各人做着各人不同工作，各人的手藝（惟有接送小少爺上學，是在中國的特殊「兼差」）。我的兄弟太多太多了，所以我們並非一父一母所生，在美國，「福特汽車廠」著名的是V字八汽缸汽車，「克萊斯勒廠」的是華貴車，「威爾士廠」的是四座小包車，「通用汽車廠」的是貨車，……但在戰時，這些著名的工廠都是我的同胞兄弟們的父母。在平時，「福特」的零件不能裝上「克萊斯勒」的車，也不能配上「威爾斯」或「通用」的車子上。惟有我們的任何一個胞兄胞弟，都可以交換穿着任何一件衣服，如有不幸殘廢，如拐手脫臂，壞心斷腸，我們胞兄胞弟之間的「五臟六腑」，都可以自由交換，不論他父母是那一個廠家。</p>
<p>零件</p>
<p>我的圖樣是美國汽車工業設計專家們之結晶，我任何一部份零件都是挑選股最精於製造這一門頭的工廠來製造。譬如我有一對防空限睛（防空燈），它的登泡子，罩子，防空色玻璃，泡泡頭…等等，都是分開各個專門工廠來製造。</p>
<p>我有堅强的抵抗力和耐震力，也有充沛的速率來馳騁行走。我雖然可以控掣，可惜我不能自主。所以，當坐在我背上的「吉普女郞」用香水的氣息，帶鼻音「唔」腔的甜言，和飄動的髮絲拂在駕駛者的面頰作多方面的迷人攻勢時，你們，不幸的車下之鬼們就在我的跟前出現。我憐惜你們，你們和我同樣的沒有罪。</p>
<p>請你們不要咀咒我和吉普女郞。因爲我們和她們同樣的任由那些飾有徽章領章胸章的大人們擺布。我們失去自由和自主。………我曾爲此而腹中雷鳴，淚下如雨：</p>
<p>但我的心是善良的。我希望車輛的主管者對於駕駛人員審核一下，有天理有良心的駕駛員也自動的自我檢討一下，看自己的駕駛技術是否已經達到水準。在這裏，我誠心地開列出一條最省錢可靠的方法，希望有車階級立即實施。</p>
<p>請先用繩子量量我前後脚（前後輸胎）的距離，拿這尺度作半徑，在平坦的廣塲或較爲廣寬而冷靜的弄堂的地面上用白粉畫一個圓周，然後，再用繩子量量我左右脚（輪胎）的距離，把道尺度加寬一尺，在先前畫好的圓周上再用白粉畫兩條直綫作爲汽車進出口。這樣，請你再找一個人在旁邊作見證，但祗許他當你失敗時吿訴你重新再來一次，而不許它事先向你警吿，說你的駕駛快就要逸出疇範。</p>
<p>行進</p>
<p>一切準備好了，請你坐在我背上，開動我從兩根直綫之間駛入圓周之內，你立刻剎車停住，倒後，轉動圓盤，前進，剎車，復倒後。……如此，不管你由左面或右面，我唯一的要求是你在五分鐘之內，將我在圓周之內倒了頭，轉了一百八十度角，由駛進圓周時那兩根直綫之間的舊路駛出，當然，車頭要先行，車屁股在後。</p>
<p>假如你能滿足我上述所說，那你就有資格向五大洲任何大都市領取汽車駕駛執照的資格。請不要看輕這個有名的國際慣用的試題。失敗了，再來！十天不成，期以一月，最後成功，必屬於您。</p>
<p>您有了上述的技能若然還有失事的話，我，「老萬」，願粉身碎骨以贖罪！</p>
<p>人命爲重，風頭爲輕。速率第二，安全第一！</p>
<p>常識</p>
<h3>關於　治外法權</h3>
<p>— 文漪</p>
<p>國人對於「治外法權」（Extrality）這個名詞恐怕沒有一個會不生惡感的，但其實這是一種誤會，治外法權不一定都是不平等的，同時很多人又常把治外法權與領事裁判權牽連在一起，而，實際上這完全是兩件事。</p>
<p>治外法權分兩種：</p>
<p>一平等的治外法權（Extra—terrioriality）這種治外法權適用）如駐外大使公使等，享受這種治外法權的即可享受下列幾種特別權利（Privileges）</p>
<p>1外交官本人及隨員Suite）享受特別優待及保護。</p>
<p>2外交官使館享受特別保護</p>
<p>3外交官有時得晋謁駐在國元首及參加特別宴會。</p>
<p>享受這種治外法權的又可免除下列各種應盡之義務（Immuniies）</p>
<p>1受駐在國民事及刑事上之制裁。</p>
<p>2不必在駐在國服兵役，到法院作證人等。</p>
<p>異國之商務官（Commercial　agents）如總領事，領事副領事等不能享受治外法權。但如駐在國特別優待，亦得享受治外法權之利益。</p>
<p>（二）不平等的治外法權（Exlra—territorality）適用於列強駐遠東（這種治外法權僅見於遠東）之僑民，不平等的治外法權包括兩種：</p>
<p>1法院裁判權（Courtisdiction）如英美日本前在上海設立特別法院。</p>
<p>2領事裁判權（ConsularJurisdiction）如多數國家前在中國未設特別法院，而民刑案件由外國領事裁判。</p>
<p>按治外法權（不平等的）起於前淸，而究其列強所以要在中國得到到治外法權的利益，實由於前淸時所訂法律之不良，即如「殺人者死」，這條法律混統看似乎沒有過不去的地方，然而其實根本錯誤。在外國殺人分故殺（Murder）與誤傷致死（Man—slaughter）而制定其罪名之輕重，然中國舊法律殺人者不問其故殺或誤傷致死，一律處以極刑，今試舉一例。</p>
<p>百年前英商船販雅片至廣東經過虎門砲台，舢板卸貨之際，有英水手不愼將雅片一箱由頂層掉下，而擊中一婦人腦袋致死，於是中國官廳强欲該船。主交出凶犯處以極刑雖經船主再三解釋係誤傷致死，不能判以極刑但是那個英國水手終於在「殺人者死」的法律下被正法了。這件事引起英國報紙的批評與攻訐，他們爲了要保陣他們僑民的生命，所以才有向中國要求「治外法權」的動機。</p>
<p>一九二一年華府會議（Washington　Conference）時，九國代表聚於華盛頓中國首席代表史兆其提議取消列强在中國境內之治外法權，各國代表對此提議俱不反對；但有附帶條件爲「中國須於一定時期內改良法律，經各國派代表團調査認可，即行取消「。中國代表回國後，即設法謀改良法律，但當時正値軍閥割據之時，改良法律，頗形困難，而爲時已久，調査團屢詢已否改良完竣，結果中國政府反去電阻駕，於是「撤消治外法權」這件事也無形擱淺。</p>
<p>直至這次戰爭勝利後，列强在中國境內的治外法權才算完全撤消。但是，自己如再不爭氣，則一切平等互惠的條約，都會自然而然變質的。</p>

<h3>新任南京市長沈怡</h3>
<p>— 長治</p>
<p>報載新任南京市長沈怡先生十四日由滬飛京，十六日就任，十八日舉行首次紀念週後正式視事。這是南京建都以來，勝利之後從「接收都市」到「建設都市」的開始。</p>
<p>南京之建設，爲今後全國各大都市建設之模範，而且在人多，嘴多，意見多，錢少，物資少的情形下，建設南京和當南京市長這一工作，實在難得很；我們希望沈怡能有過人的經騐與魄力，把南京建設好，使中外觀感爲之一新。這裏僅介紹一些沈怡的二三事，並不想在道裏先頌揚他怎樣好，好不好，須看將來事實的表現。</p>
<p>當你坐着汽車從北四川路底經過江灣而達市中心區虬江碼頭等地，沿途寬廣舉目無邊坦平光滑四通八達的柏油馬路………整齊的樹木……偉大的建築物羅列其間，這就是抗戰前「大上海建設計劃」市政建設實行家沈怡先生心血的結晶。沈先生如能利用過去的經騐，來長南京，也許可以勝任愉快。</p>
<p>抗戰以前沈市長長滬市工務局十年，以「專家」而仕，經五易市長，在國事不振，强鄰脅境之下，從事市政建設實際工作，爲各方所欽遲。他是一位工程師，抗戰期內主持大後方甘肅省水利工程及任交部决長，襄助政府，參與抗戰大計，實行「建國政治」，對抗戰略有質獻，這大槪是他此次長京的主要原因。</p>
<p>回想勝利當年，政府當局發表東北各省市行政首長名單時，會愼重誠懇宣吿國人：「東北久經淪陷，主政人員，都是精心選拔國內第一流建設人才。」勝利一年，當局認爲大連市政遲遲不獲隱定，便派沈怡出馬。這說明當局對沈氏的重視。他在大連時，適值東北錯綜複雜的軍政間題沒有解決，其成績如何，很難論定。現在沈氏旣調主京市，大概可以一顯身手。</p>
<p>關於南京，大家都知道：交通的不便，街道的不整，下水道的淤塞，是市政的致命傷。這一切改進，當然必須有錢。不過，決不能把一切未盡人力的過失，完全推諉在「錢」的上面。前任京市長的不得好評，肇因於此。</p>
<p>這裏，雖然是空空洞洞的幾句話，却是一般人對於沈怡先生的厚望。我想他決不會使人民失望的！</p>

<h3>無辜的殺人犯7</h3>
<p>— 許桂庭</p>
<p>魯遜蹙一蹙眉頭說：「但是，她會打電話去報吿警局的。她會裝做睡覺，然後打電話去報吿的。你看罷，女人總是這一套的。可是，米恩夫人，我並不是說你待我不好的啊！」。</p>
<p>「即使她這樣做，又有什麼大不了的事呢？你遲早總要對他們說的呀。我以爲現在喚他們來這裏也是對的。」</p>
<p>魯遜靠緊着椅子，手仍然插在大衣袋裏，說：「現在什麽都淸楚了。眞可憐，從前總未曾弄淸楚。我的父親使媽媽捱了不少苦頭，但是我是很愛她。當然，我是一個獨生子。可是，她對我不忠實，還是和他鬼混，所以我先把他殺死，然後用手槍打死她。你們同意這樣做法是合理嗎？我相信在法國的人是贊成這樣做法的。」</p>
<p>「你什麼時候把手槍打死她的呀？」米恩問。</p>
<p>「噢，許多年前了，」他很狡滑的笑了一笑：「最有趣的就是：假使她不和他鬼混，怎樣會生我出來呢？」他對米恩夫人似乎頗爲親熱地看了一看，說：「這是米恩夫人所指點出來的呢。」</p>
<p>柏莉鎭靜地說：「但是，我不明白魯遜夫人怎樣會撹在一起的。我很明白關於你的母親的一切。」</p>
<p>魯遜臉龐似乎要崩潰了，表示極痛苦地說：「我不想談及我的妻子。她是一個偉大的孩子。如果有人說不是的話，他一定是一個可惡的說謊傢伙。」講完這句話之後，他轉向着米恩，突然間冷笑起來說：「奇怪得很，你爲什麼要道樣麻煩來聽我講日本鬼予的事情呢？這是一些也不重要的。」</p>
<p>「我也想到，這或者不是關於你的故事的全部。」米恩說：「我揣測你以前一定不高興把所有的事情吿訴我的。」</p>
<p>「並非如此」，魯遜皺着眉頭說：一事情沒有弄淸楚之前，我當然不高興完全講出來呀。」他又注視着柏莉，向她做着怪親熱的笑臉，然後說：「對不起，我不想再使你覺得無聊。米恩天人，如果你覺得疲倦，你可以去睡。」</p>
<p>柏莉躊躇一會，勉强笑着說：「你不介意嗎？我覺得有些眼倦呢。」</p>
<p>「當然不介意，」魯遜馬上跳起來說，他的手還是插在大衣袋裏。他靜默地立着，一直等到柏莉出去而且關了門。然後，他轉過身，冷笑　：「我可以和你購五塊錢，她一定是跑出去，用電話報吿警局。女人總是干篇一律的。我當然知道的，可是她　視着我，簡直像貓監視着耗子一樣，我有什麽辦法？」他長嘆一聲，同時就把手槍從袋裏拿出來。</p>
<p>米恩立刻對他說：「魯遜，請你把手槍給我！」</p>
<p>「這校手槍嗎？很好。」魯遜立刻把手槍擺在左手，然後伸出來。同時，他用右拳猛擊米恩的頭部。米恩閃避不及，吃了一拳，就跌到一張椅上去了。</p>
<p>魯遜大聲嚷道：「對不起，大夫！對不起，大夫！」他連忙走到窗口去。左手仍然緊握着手槍亂弄了一會習門，把窗打開，一　煙就跑掉了。柏莉還立在走廊上，臉色和紙一樣的蒼白。（未完）</p>

<h3>First National Assembly Preparatory Meeting: Lively Discussion on Methods for Electing Presidium, Representatives Fully Demonstrate Democratic Spirit</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 18th Dispatch] The National Assembly held a preparatory meeting at 10:00 AM on the 18th, with 1,372 representatives in attendance. Chairman Chiang, in his capacity as a National Representative, arrived at the venue at exactly 10:00 AM, with his wife arriving five minutes later. The meeting commenced at 10:10 AM. First, Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee, gave a report, stating briefly: The National Assembly originally planned for 2,050 representatives, of which 1,690 were announced by the National Government. As of this morning, 1,501 representatives had registered, and by 10:00 AM, 1,289 had arrived, meeting the legal quorum, and the meeting was declared open. A motion was then made to publicly nominate a temporary chairman. Chen Jiesheng proposed Sun Ke, which was unanimously applauded. Mr. Sun then took the chair amidst a burst of spotlights and thunderous applause. The meeting began under Mr. Sun's guidance. Today's agenda was to discuss the election methods for the Presidium. Hong Lanyou first explained the draft, stating that the key point of the careful selection methods was to achieve the goal of electing the virtuous and capable. Representatives then spoke and discussed the points to be amended. Throughout the process, over thirty representatives spoke, but 104 had requested to speak. Due to time constraints, at the legally mandated adjournment time of 12:00 PM, the temporary chairman announced a half-hour extension. However, not all could speak, and the meeting adjourned at 12:40 PM. It was also decided to continue the preparatory meeting at 9:00 AM tomorrow to discuss the methods. The draft of the National Assembly Presidium election methods and the discussion process are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Draft: Article 1: Presidium candidates shall be elected by each representative-generating unit. Each unit shall elect at least one person, and units with more than ten representatives shall add one candidate for every additional ten representatives, rounding up any remainder less than ten. Elections shall be conducted by each unit using a non-named cumulative voting method, with those receiving more votes being elected, forming the overall list of candidates. Nominees are not limited to representatives from the originating unit.</p>
<p>Article 2: The Presidium shall consist of 55 members, elected by the National Assembly representatives from the overall list of Presidium candidates using a non-named cumulative voting method. Those receiving more votes shall be elected, and ties shall be resolved by drawing lots.</p>
<p>Article 3: The number of Presidium candidates selected by representatives directly appointed by the National Government who are elected as Presidium members should be generated in proportion to the number of representatives from each representative-generating unit. If the proportional quota is not met, it may be calculated separately.</p>
<p>Article 4: These methods shall be implemented after being approved by the National Assembly preparatory meeting.</p>
<p>(B) Discussion Process: Although today's discussion was only on the election methods for the Presidium, all representatives attached great importance to it, conducting research with extreme caution. Speakers were very enthusiastic, with 104 representatives requesting to speak. Due to time constraints, only over thirty were able to express their opinions. The situation was lively, and no decision could be reached by 12:30 PM. The chairman then announced that another preparatory meeting would be held at 9:00 AM on the 19th to continue the discussion. The various opinions are summarized as follows: 1. Professional representatives and regional representatives should be nominated separately, as they are generated separately. In particular, farmers', industrial, and commercial organizations should be nominated separately; 2. Special attention should be paid to farmers, as over 85% of China's population are farmers. Professional organizations and the interests of farmers should not be ignored; 3. It was proposed to amend the last sentence of Article 1 of the election methods, namely: "Nominees are not limited to representatives from the originating unit."

<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 18th Dispatch] Dozens of speakers at the National Assembly preparatory meeting on the election methods for the Presidium truly demonstrated democratization. According to Chen Lifu, the National Assembly is the first step towards democracy. We are very pleased with today's enthusiastic situation, as democracy is essentially a waste of time. However, this waste of time is to integrate opinions from all parties, so for the sake of perfect opinions, although it may feel time-consuming, it is still necessary.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 18th Dispatch] Wu Tiecheng flew from Shanghai to Nanjing at 8:30 AM on the 18th and immediately attended the National Assembly preparatory meeting.</p>

Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members, heads of various agencies, vice ministers, and Kuomintang members among the National Assembly representatives attended. Chairman Chiang personally led the ceremony and delivered instructions, stating briefly: I am very pleased to gather with all the representatives because of the National Assembly meeting. Convening the National Assembly has been the goal for which our party and the people of the whole country have struggled for many years. Our party, in accordance with the teachings of the late Premier and all the martyrs and their revolutionary spirit, has worked hard for more than fifty years to convene the National Assembly, promulgate the Constitution, and lay the foundation for national construction. Therefore, this conference is truly related to the success or failure of our national construction cause, and you all bear a very important responsibility. I hope that in this decisive meeting, we can formulate a sound constitution to comfort the spirits of the late Premier and all the martyrs in heaven. The Chairman then urged the representatives to be kind and humble, to be orderly and disciplined during the meetings. After the speech, he led the reading of the Party members' code of conduct, and the ceremony concluded after forty minutes.</p>

A second meeting will be held at 3:00 PM on the 19th, which is expected to complete everything.</p>
<h3>Zeng Qi Discusses Constitution-Making</h3>
<p>Should Be Trans-Partisan and Trans-Regional</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 18th Dispatch] Zeng Qi delivered a speech on constitution-making at a dinner party for representatives from Sichuan, Xikang, Yunnan, Guizhou, and other provinces and cities on the 18th, emphasizing that the Constitution is trans-partisan and trans-regional, made for the country, not for parties or regions. National interests and ethnic interests should be paramount, and no one party or faction can impose its unilateral will on the entire Constitution. He also stated that the Youth Party has no unilateral intentions and will strive for the integrity of the Constitution. Recently, he has felt unwell and is resting.</p>

<p>Recently, he has felt unwell and is resting.</p>

<h3>Democratic Socialist Party Representatives Arrive in Beiping from Nanjing: Discuss Participation in National Assembly. Chen Cheng and Others Meet with Zhang Junmai</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 18th Dispatch] Zhang Junmai's representative, Sun Baogang, flew to Beiping at 5:00 PM on the 18th and drove to the residence of Hu Haimen, a Standing Committee member of the Democratic Socialist Party, to rest and attend a dinner hosted by Hu, accompanied by Liang Qiushui, another Standing Committee member of the party, and more than a dozen other important Democratic Socialist Party members. The issue of the Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the National Assembly was discussed during the dinner. It is reported that Sun stated to Hu, Liang, and others after disembarking that Mr. Junmai sent him to solicit the opinions of colleagues in the north. Mr. Junmai has no intention of making a decision on the issue of participation in the National Assembly alone. As of the time of this dispatch, the dinner at Hu's residence had not yet ended. Zhang Dongsheng, the second-in-command of the Democratic Socialist Party, paced around his room and felt extremely uneasy after receiving a telegram from Zhang Junmai yesterday urging him to go to Nanjing. Today, reporters visited him twice, but Zhang remained tight-lipped, saying that he was unwilling to make any comments before consulting with his colleagues and making a decision. It is reported that Zhang telegraphed the Shanghai headquarters of the Democratic Socialist Party on the 16th, opposing participation in the National Assembly, stating: "Do not vote to participate, otherwise the party will split." As of today, Zhang's intention seems to remain firm. As of 5:00 PM this afternoon, Zhang was still in the faculty dormitory No. 31 of Yenching University, anxiously pondering this important issue. According to his wife, Zhang and Liang Shuming will attend a dinner hosted by Pan Guangdan at Tsinghua University tonight. Someone familiar with the party's internal affairs said: The Democratic Socialist Party has seven Standing Committee members. The Shanghai side has four Standing Committee members, of which three support participation in the National Assembly and one opposes; Beiping has three Standing Committee members, namely Zhang Dongsheng, Hu Haimen, and Liang Qiushui, who oppose participation. Therefore, the Democratic Socialist Party is likely to split over this issue. It is not yet known what the outcome of Sun Baogang's visit and discussions with Zhang and others will be as of the time of this dispatch.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 18th Dispatch] After Zhang Junmai's two representatives arrived in Beiping, Ye Duzhuang went directly from the airport to Yenching University to discuss with Zhang Dongsheng. Sun Baogang entered the city to discuss with Hu Haimen and others.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 18th Dispatch] It is heard that the government can largely agree to the four points proposed by Zhang Junmai. Zhang Junmai was very busy today. Lei Zhen visited him at 9:00 AM, Zhang Qun visited him at 11:00 AM, Lei visited him again at 4:00 PM, Shao Lizi also visited him at 5:00 PM, and at 7:00 PM he attended a dinner hosted by Chen Cheng and Wang Shijie. Democratic Socialist Party members Sun Baogang and Ye Duyi flew to Beiping on the morning of the 18th and will return to Nanjing soon. The party's submission of the National Assembly list can be decided in the near future.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 18th Dispatch] Chen Cheng and Wang Shijie hosted guests at No. 8 Putuo Road at 7:00 PM on the 18th, including Zhang Jia'ao, Zhang Jun, Chuan Sinian, Fan Yushui, Zhou Gengsheng, Gao Yihan, Xiao Yishan, Miao Jiaming, Zhang Junmai, Zuo Shunsheng, Zeng Qi, Chen Qitian, Gu Yuxiu, Zhang Bojin, and Tong Guanxian. They had dinner and talked until they dispersed one after another at about 9:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 18th Dispatch] The Democratic League held an internal meeting at 9:00 AM on the 18th. In the afternoon, Shao Lizi visited Luo Longji and others, and at 6:30 PM, Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun visited Zhou Enlai.</p>

<h3>CCP May Agree to 13 Government Committee Seats</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 18th Dispatch] The reorganization of the Government Committee is under discussion. As for the issue of Government Committee seats, the CCP has abandoned its previous insistence on 14 seats and may agree to the government's suggestion of 13 seats. Seats for the CCP and the Democratic League will be reserved. Someone stated: If Zhang Junmai participates, he will also be a member of the Democratic League. The government is also considering reorganizing the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Parachute Brigade Headquarters Statement: No Transfers of Troops</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Office, 18th Dispatch] Major General Ma Shigong, Commander of the Parachute Brigade, issued the following important statement at noon on the 18th: The only parachute unit in China is the Parachute Brigade, commanded by me. The current troop strength is entirely stationed along the Nanjing-Shanghai line, and a portion is currently concentrated in Nanjing for training. There have been no transfers. The rumor that they have been concentrated near the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region is completely absurd. The Communist Party's intention in spreading this news is purely to emphasize the atmosphere of war and attempt to cover up the impropriety of its war preparations, which is intended to confuse the world.</p>
<h3>Niu Yongjian Arrives in Shenyang</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Office, 18th Dispatch] Niu Yongjian and his wife flew to Shenyang at noon on the 18th and plan to stay here for five or six days. He will begin inspecting party affairs on the 19th and then go to Changchun and Yongji.</p>
<h3>Implementation of Comprehensive Import Control: Industry to Receive Protection. Wang Yunwu Supplements Import and Export Control Opinions</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 18th Dispatch] After Song Ziwen issued a statement on import and export controls, Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu added on the 17th: Import control is necessary at present and is also a unanimous request from China's nascent industrial and commercial sectors. This time, all imports will be comprehensively controlled. Among them, it is stipulated that machinery and industrial equipment should be given preferential treatment, while other imports will be stricter than before. I believe that the government can protect industry from now on, and international allies will certainly understand our actions. After import control, the volume of imports may not necessarily decrease, but it will be mostly for what we need. The government should strengthen transportation and facilitate these necessities. However, it is reasonable to strictly control those that are harmful to the nation. Only in this way can we cultivate our industry and increase production. The measures announced this time are very good, but they still need to be supplemented and carefully studied in implementation.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Preparatory Meeting Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Zhang Ming</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's appearance at the venue as a National Representative was a surprise to everyone. He quietly entered and sat in seat number one, which he had drawn. Five minutes later, Madame Chiang arrived in a light coffee-colored sea tiger velvet coat and sat in seat number two, next to the Chairman and Minister Bai.</p>
<p>As soon as Minister Bai entered the venue, he said to reporters: You have a lot of news to report. Chen Lifu and a Tibetan representative in lama attire entered the venue together, talking as they walked. Wang Shijie was very interested in the voting machine and stood there for several minutes, looking up at it. At 11:10, Shao Lizi left the meeting, and at 11:13, Wang Shijie left. Sensitive reporters immediately guessed the reason why the two representatives of the Political Consultative Conference left one after another. However, when the reporter went to the National Political Council during the break, he saw Shao renovating old envelopes in the office.</p>
<p>By 11:00, the meeting was still nowhere near resolution. One representative stood up and spoke without going through the initial procedures of civil rights, loudly urging the chairman to pay attention to controlling the time. Unexpectedly, another representative then said in an even louder voice: "Even if it takes until tomorrow, we still have to discuss it. We cannot limit it by time." The venue immediately became chaotic.</p>
<p>Presidents Dai and Yu of the two academies both wore long gowns and mandarin jackets. President Dai sat upright, deep in thought, while President Yu kept flipping through the agenda and handbook, as well as newspapers.</p>
<p>Chen Guofu wore a Zhongshan suit, perhaps because of his cough, and had a wool scarf around his neck. He constantly paid attention to the movements of the journalists. Someone said: "Guofu is studying the attitude and interviewing skills of young reporters again."</p>
<p>The representatives' lounge was crowded with people during the break, and journalists wove in and out like shuttles, forming a news network.</p>
<p>Female representatives Zhuang Jing and Chen Yiyun stood together, both wearing dark green woolen cheongsams, but Chen was thin and Zhuang was plump, making for a strong contrast.</p>
<p>Many of those who spoke today spoke Sichuan dialect. None of the female representatives spoke, but after the meeting, Liu Hengjing repeatedly said to reporters: "Women suffer losses. I originally wanted to speak, but when everyone was shaking the fundamental principles of this draft, it was even harder for me to speak."</p>
<p>Zhang Daofan spoke most logically and clearly, attracting the attention of the entire venue.</p>
<p>The journalists who were observing had arrived at the venue around 8:00 AM to occupy seats. By the time the meeting began, the seats were already gone, and those who arrived later naturally had to stand there as onlookers. Youth Party representative Zeng Qi shook hands everywhere in the venue.</p>
<p>On the day that the government announced the revised Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade, Wang Yunwu became the target of interviews, but he did not say much.</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng had just returned to Nanjing from Shanghai today and appeared at the venue before 10:00 AM, attracting much attention.</p>
<p>Li Zongren's seat was on the side, and because he was relatively small, many people ignored him. Although he had three shining general stars, the reporters still recognized his identity.</p>
<p>By the time the meeting adjourned, it was 12:35 PM, and everyone was hungry. All that could be heard was the conference staff reporting where representatives and journalists were being entertained.</p>
<p>Chairman Shang and his wife left during the break after 11:15. However, before Madame left, she was surrounded by journalists asking for her autograph. Madame, in her capacity as a National Representative, signed for the general public.</p>
<p>Chairman Sun Ke coughed dryly every time he spoke, and he sat in the chairman's reclining chair, consulting documents, just like in the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<p>When Sun Ke was nominated through the microphone during the election of the chairman, Chairman Sun and Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng happened to enter the venue, and a burst of welcome applause erupted like spring thunder.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang was in his seat and used a 51-type Parker pen to take notes on the speeches of the representatives. At 11:15, he handed in a note suggesting a five-minute break.</p>
<p>After the break, Chairman Chiang left. Minister Bai sat alone quietly, frequently looking at his watch, and at 12:00, he grabbed his briefcase and left in a hurry. Representative Xie Dizhong of the Miao people spoke with the most passionate emotion.</p>
<p>Although Zhang Qun had registered, he did not attend, presumably busy with negotiations again.</p>

<h3>Allied Industrial Equipment Compensation from Japan: China to Receive the Majority. US Decides to Expedite Distribution of Japanese Reparations, Ship Shortage Causes Transportation Problems</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th Special Dispatch] According to Ray Dai, Chief of the Industry and Compensation Section of the Economic and Industrial Group of the Allied Headquarters, China will receive the majority of the industrial equipment and machinery from Japan as compensation, but the transport of such compensation goods to China will be a long-term matter. Months ago, the Chinese government requested the issuance of various urgently needed equipment and machinery for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of areas destroyed by the Japanese army during the war. However, the Allied Headquarters authorities cannot agree to China's request without the consent of the Far Eastern Commission in Washington. A considerable amount of materials suitable for China's special purposes should have been shipped from Japan since January of this year as compensation. The Far Eastern Commission's delay in distributing Japanese reparations is due to the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the compensation conference convened in August of this year. Not only the Chinese government, but also other allies and the Allied Headquarters itself, are eager to clarify the relevant issues and take action regarding Japanese reparations. The Allied Headquarters is particularly concerned about this, because the long-term suspension of the matter of Japanese factories that can be considered exempt from compensation will delay industrial recovery and indirectly prolong the occupation period. Currently, regardless of whether the Soviet Union participates in the discussions or not, the recent decision by the United States to proceed with the distribution of Japanese reparations may lead to decisive action. Pauley's report to President Truman, suggesting that the United States immediately begin collecting Japanese reparations, may expedite the matter; however, the word "immediately" is somewhat misleading, as collecting various material reparations from Japan is an extraordinarily complex issue. Various small items, such as machine tools, generators, and other independent units of machinery, can be packed and shipped within weeks, but disassembling an entire factory may take months. Inventories of various machine tools and other small items have recently been created, and status reports on various factories and departments are being prepared, but it is quite difficult to find power plants and factories for special purposes that meet the requirements of the various Allied countries. The Allied Headquarters authorities are already worried about the impact of the removal of compensation goods on the Japanese economy. Protecting and packing the various machines to be removed also requires a huge amount of wood, nails, and grease. These few items alone represent a huge expenditure. Months ago, officials from the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry estimated that the wood needed to package the compensation goods was almost equal to the wood needed for housing construction throughout Japan. The domestic transportation plan in Japan is also extremely large. How to transport the compensation goods out of Japan has also become a problem. Japan's current transportation capacity is insufficient to transport the compensation goods. Most of the US Liberty ships lent to the Japanese government for repatriating Japanese people have also been returned to the United States. Transportation will be a particularly big problem for China, as China has limited ships, while the total amount of machinery shipped from Japan is very large.</p>
<h3>Exchange Ceremony of Ratification Instruments of China-Sweden New Treaty Held Yesterday, Completed in Three Minutes</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 18th Dispatch] The exchange ceremony of ratification instruments of the new China-Sweden Treaty was held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 2:00 PM on the 18th. At about 2:00 PM, the Swedish Ambassador to China, Yale, and the Commercial Secretary, Long Haide, arrived at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where they were received by Wang Jizheng, Chief of the Protocol Department, and escorted to the reception room on the second floor for a brief rest. Then, Foreign Minister Wang, Vice Ministers Gan Naiguang, Wang Huacheng, Ye Gongchao, Chen Xiongfei, and Chen Mingchi arrived. Foreign Minister Wang shook hands with Ambassador Yale and greeted him, happily saying: "It's a very nice day today!" Then, they began to exchange signatures on the two ratified red books placed on the long table in the pre-arranged room. Suddenly, the mercury lamps lit up brightly, and photographers scrambled for shots. Foreign Minister Wang signed his name in Chinese and English with a brush and a fountain pen, while Yale signed his Swedish name with a fountain pen. After both signed and affixed rubber seals, they raised champagne glasses to congratulate each other. The entire ceremony was completed within three minutes. Yale chatted with Foreign Minister Wang for a while before leaving with one copy of the treaty at 2:20 PM. According to the provisions of Article 8 of the treaty between China and Sweden on the abolition of Swedish extraterritorial rights and other related privileges in China, which was signed in Chongqing on April 5, 1945, and ratified by the governments of both countries, the treaty shall enter into force from the date on which the two governments mutually notify each other of its ratification. The treaty had been approved and entered into force by the governments of both countries on July 20 of the same year. Today was the exchange of ratified treaty books, with two copies exchanged. After the exchange, Swedish Ambassador Yale met with reporters and made a speech, saying: The Swedish people respect China's lasting civilization, and the shipping line operates approximately once a month. There are also two companies operating the China-US route.</p>

<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 18th] According to transportation sources: the central government is currently planning to build the Marshall Railway, starting from Zhanjiang City, passing through Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Gansu, and ending in Xinjiang.

<p>[Central News Agency, Xiamen, 18th] Following the closing of the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Economic Construction Company's promoters' meeting, the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee responsible for planning and carrying out concrete work held its first meeting this morning. It determined the personnel responsible for various groups and elected Hu Wenhu as the director of the Standing Committee by vote, with Wang Zhenxiang and Huang Chongji as his deputies, and He Baoren as the secretary-general.</p>
<h3>Chairman Cares About Northern Jiangsu's Recovery, Personally Orders Chairman Su to Reside in Huaiyin for Supervision</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 18th] It is reported that Chairman Chiang, recognizing that Northern Jiangsu is devastated after its recapture and that pacification and administrative affairs urgently need to be promoted for recovery, has personally ordered the Executive Yuan's Pacification Zone Political Affairs Committee to inform Chairman Wang of Jiangsu Province to reside permanently in Huaiyin to facilitate close supervision.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Executive Yuan's Pacification Zone Political Affairs Committee is scheduled to hold a meeting today at the Ministry of National Defense in Nanjing. Party, government, military, and civic groups from Jiangsu Province have gathered in Nanjing to participate. It is reported that the meeting will broadly discuss the coordination of military, political, and economic efforts in the recovered areas for pacification and will decide on concrete measures to stabilize rural areas, restore production, and gradually achieve recovery in the shortest possible time. Regarding the exemption from taxes and levies in the counties of Northern Jiangsu, subsidies for county and township administrative expenses will also be decided to prevent the occurrence of apportionment and increase the burden on the people.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Chairman Wang of Jiangsu Province, concerned about the disaster situation in the harvest areas of Northern Jiangsu, has recently decided to allocate 4 million to 6 million yuan per county for disaster relief. Chairman Wang has now arrived in Nanjing from Xuzhou and is expected to return to the province within two or three days.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] To strengthen the administrative efficiency of the recovered areas and adapt to current needs, the provincial government will replace county magistrates in Jiangnan who are incompetent or have poor performance in stages. This will be discussed and decided at a provincial government meeting after Chairman Wang Maogong returns to the province.</p>
<p>[Our Yangzhou Dispatch, 18th] The Ding embankment of the Grand Canal, from Jiangdu to Tianchang, has seen improving order after the garrison troops led by Brigade Commander Liang cleared the area and assisted the local government in vigorously implementing pacification. The reorganization of the baojia system is underway, and increasing numbers of refugees are returning home.</p>
<h3>Living Expenses of Family Members of Traitors</h3>
<p>New Interpretation by Counselor of the Judicial Yuan</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Regarding the issue of appropriately retaining living expenses for family members of traitors, since the publication of Interpretation No. 3213 of the Judicial Yuan, it has been generally considered too abstract, and it is feared that difficulties will arise during handling. A reporter visited Counselor Ge of the Judicial Yuan regarding this matter, who said: The situations in various places are different, and individual family circumstances also vary. Therefore, it is difficult to make a definitive provision for the living expenses of family members of traitors. However, family members of traitors who have independent abilities and can support themselves will not be considered for retention. Therefore, although there are no rigid regulations, handling will not be as difficult as imagined. As for the issue of debt repayment for traitors, the reason for stipulating that the executing agency is not responsible for clearing debts is to limit the fraudulent collection of debts. Although this is unfair to a small number of creditors, it is necessary to protect the general interest.</p>
<h3>Increasingly Fast Land and Air Transportation Between Nanjing-Shanghai and the Northwest; Direct Train Service from Xuzhou to Xi'an Resumes</h3>
<p>[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 17th] The direct train service between Xuzhou and Xi'an on the Longhai Railway, which had been suspended for nearly ten years, has recently resumed with a newly compiled train, the "Yellow River," with an actual travel time of only twenty-six hours. People here are very excited. It is generally believed that if the train does not stop overnight in Kaifeng and connects with train schedules to Pukou and Shanghai in Xuzhou, the journey between Shanghai and Xi'an could be shortened to three days, and the "Yellow River" train could be increased from once a week to twice a week. Passenger and freight transportation for the five provinces of Jiangsu, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Southern Shanxi, as well as postal services, will greatly benefit. However, the railway still sells tickets in sections along the line, and each transfer provides an opportunity for black market ticket activity, with prices rising to more than double.</p>
<p>Furthermore, air transportation between Xi'an and Nanjing-Shanghai has recently become increasingly smooth. However, although the air journey is only six or seven hours, "aviation" mail rarely arrives within 100 hours, and newspapers sent by airmail sometimes take seven days, which urgently needs improvement by the post office.</p>
<p>Transportation between Lanzhou and Xi'an still relies on highway bus transport. Recently, the number of buses has increased to daily departures in both directions, scheduled to arrive in four days, but if there are no breakdowns along the way, a round trip can be made within a week.</p>
<h3>Railway Transportation Inspection Group Arrives in Hankou from Zhengzhou Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 18th] The national railway transportation inspection group, led by Jin Shixuan, arrived in Hankou from Zhengzhou yesterday. Starting today, they will divide and inspect various departments of the Pinghan Railway Bureau, and then proceed along the Yuehan Railway to Hengyang, Guangzhou, and Kowloon for work, before flying from Kowloon to Shanghai and then to Hangzhou for inspection.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Rushes to Repair the Circum-Hainan Highway</h3>
<p>Deadline at the end of the month for completion and traffic opening next month</p>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 18th] In order to expedite the repair of the Circum-Hainan Highway to facilitate the export of local products, the Guangdong Department of Construction has specially sent Highway Director Yi De to preside over the project, with a deadline for completion at the end of the month. The road runs from Haikou, passing through Langdong, Wenchang, Yaxian, Maimao, Lingshui, and other counties to Yulin Port, and will be open to traffic on the 20th of next month.</p>
<h3>Representative of the Bank of Taiwan Handles Foreign Exchange Settlement Matters for Seven Banks in Shanghai; Implementation to Begin Upon Exchange of Official Correspondence</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 18th] The Bank of Taiwan has recently reached an agreement with the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Shanghai Bank, HSBC, Mercantile Bank, Citibank, and Chase Bank in Shanghai, whereby the Bank of Taiwan will represent the above seven banks in handling foreign exchange settlement certificates and related matters for Taiwan. Implementation will begin upon the exchange of official correspondence. Yan Jiagan, Director of the Finance Department of Taiwan Province, stated that in the past, export goods from Taiwan Province had to go through foreign exchange settlement procedures in Shanghai, which was inconvenient. In the future, export goods will no longer need to be transshipped through Shanghai and can be directly shipped to foreign countries, including Hong Kong and Macau. The trade in products from Taiwan Province will enter a new stage. He also stated that foreign cargo ships can conveniently pass through Taiwan to load goods, but the minimum amount of export cargo that can be loaded each time must be at least 500 tons for foreign ships to be willing to come to Taiwan.</p>
<h3>Thirty Young Chinese Naval Personnel Trained on British Ships in the Mediterranean; Chairman Chiang's Grandnephew Among Them</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Malta, 18th] About thirty young Chinese naval soldiers who volunteered to join the Royal Navy before Japan's surrender are currently serving on the British First Cruiser Squadron flagship, HMS Mauritius. They are aged between twenty and twenty-one and have previously received a year of training at coastal base fleets in Plymouth and Carson, England. They are now undergoing six months of ocean-going fleet training. Everyone is now a second-class gunner. Many suffered from seasickness when they first encountered ocean life, with only four being spared. The food and treatment on board are exactly the same as for other soldiers. They are divided into three groups during work and have not yet been assigned night guard duty. The thirty live together in a room at the front of HMS Mauritius, and British Navy Sergeant Dunstable is responsible for liaison and explaining various issues to them. These Chinese youths are of excellent character, never drink alcohol, and only four smoke. Perhaps because they know that the training period is only eighteen months, they are all very diligent in their work. One of them, Chiang Tongfu (transliteration), is Chairman Chiang's grandnephew.</p>
<h3>Resumption of Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Imminent; Engineering Bureau Sends Letters to County and City Governments Along the Line for Assistance; Land Legally Purchased to be Taken Back Starting This Month</h3>

<h3>Editorial: New Trends in the International Situation</h3>
<p>Perhaps due to the convening of the National Assembly, the general public's attention seems to be focused on domestic affairs. However, in recent days, a new trend in the international situation cannot be ignored. This new trend is manifested in two different situations. First, as a result of the US elections, the Republican Party, known as right-leaning, holds a controlling majority in the US Congress. Second, there is a rise of left-wing political groups in Europe. The rise of left-wing political groups in Europe is manifested in two different situations: (1) As a result of the French general election, the Communist Party has once again become the leading party in the Fourth Republic; (2) Signs of division within the British Labour Party—this is manifested in dozens of British Labour MPs expressing disagreement with the government's foreign policy in the House of Commons and demanding revisions. This new trend in the international situation is worth our attention.</p>
<p>This new trend in the international situation manifests in two different forms: the so-called right-leaning Republican Party gaining power in the United States, and the rise of left-wing groups in Europe. However, if we investigate further, although the forms or appearances of this trend are different, the factors that contribute to it are the same. What are these contributing factors? It is the expansion of Soviet power. Since the surrender of the Nazis and the cessation of the European war, Soviet power has actively expanded into Europe. It goes without saying that the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, which were independent countries before the war, have now been incorporated into Soviet territory. Poland, Romania, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and even Czechoslovakia have now effectively become vassals of the Soviet Union. In defeated Germany, the Soviet occupation zone is not only larger in area than the British, American, and French occupation zones, but also psychologically the heart of Germany for the German people. Furthermore, throughout the world, from the Dardanelles to distant places, including the Indian Ocean coast of Africa, the Kuril Islands in the North Pacific, and even the desolate Antarctic, the Soviet Union is demonstrating its power. What humanity has discovered from the Second World War is the malignant expansion of Soviet power. Even the United States, which supplied the Soviet Union with Lend-Lease materials, enabling it to defeat Nazi Germany, feels difficult to cope with in this situation. Appeasement towards the Soviet Union? This ultimately compromises the dignity of the United States. Therefore, despite the existence of figures like Wallace who advocate appeasement towards the Soviet Union, American public opinion generally believes that it is unacceptable. Taking a tough stance towards the Soviet Union? The current situation of the United States does not permit it. This is why the policy of Byrnes is hard within the soft, and soft within the hard.</p>
<p>Because the United States does not have a firm policy towards the Soviet Union, the result is a further expansion of Soviet power. Europeans are particularly sensitive to this situation, especially left-wing parties such as the Communist Party, which originally had a close relationship with Moscow. Taking advantage of the people's fear of the Soviet Union and their disappointment with the United States, the Communist Party and left-wing political groups have a great opportunity to assert themselves. This is why the Communist Party re-emerged in the recent French general election and became the leading party in France. This is also why the ruling Labour Party in Britain is showing signs of division. Speaking of Britain, its Labour Party originally had a clear distinction from left-wing political parties on the European continent. Socialism in Britain was originally just a pastime for the intellectual class, and it did not have the left-leaning color of the continent. Although trade unions and other groups later joined, their consistent style was legal and orderly competition, unlike the tendency of continental socialism towards riots. Since the Labour Party won the general election and formed a government, it has adhered to this conservative tradition. In the situation of US-Soviet rivalry, it has adopted a relatively pro-US policy. Because the adoption of this policy conforms to the conditions of the Labour Party and also conforms to the conditions of Britain. However, for a year, the expansion of Soviet power has continued as before, which has aroused the dissatisfaction of a small number of young and passionate Labour MPs, resulting in a new isolationism that is similar to appeasement towards the Soviet Union. Now that the Attlee government has therefore requested a vote of confidence, it can be said with certainty that it will not receive the support of a majority of British Labour MPs.</p>
<p>Because the current US government does not have a firm policy towards the Soviet Union, and at the same time, does not have policies in various parts of the world and within the United States, the result is reflected in the success of the Republican Party in the US election. Although both the Republican and Democratic parties claim that the results of this election have no impact on US foreign policy. However, we must understand that the reason why this election has no direct impact on US foreign policy is not because the Republican Party has any goodwill towards the Democratic Party; it is because the Democratic Party still holds the power of the administration. Although the American people have expressed their aversion to the Democratic Party, the Republican Party has no right to form a government due to constitutional provisions. The Republican Party's foreign policy is naturally more realistic than that of the Democratic Party. Taking China as an example, during the era of Democratic Party rule, there could be the Lansing-Ishii Agreement in the past, and the Yalta Agreement later on; while in the era of the Republican Party, we saw the Washington Conference and the agreement on Chinese tariff autonomy. The Republican Party is famous for its "big stick" policy. Although this election gave them control of Congress, it did not give them the power of the administration; but due to the results of this election, it may cause the government of President Truman to adopt a firmer stance on foreign policy.</p>
<p>Therefore, no matter which aspect we look at, although the forms presented by the current new international trend are different, their essence is the same, that is, how to deal with the continued expansion of Soviet power. Our country's relationship with the Soviet Union is of utmost importance. The length of the Sino-Soviet border is unparalleled in the world. We should cherish the land friendship of the Soviet Union. Then, how will we deal with the Soviet Union? This is indeed worthy of our serious consideration.</p>

<h3>Sanmen Bay to be Developed; Inspection Group and Construction Committee to be Established First</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch] The Zhejiang Provincial Government plans to develop coastal reclamation. Regarding the proposal to develop Sanmen Bay, the Provincial Assembly unanimously resolved to request the Provincial Government to quickly make plans. There has also been a long-standing debate on whether to request the establishment of a commercial port in the bay. According to experts, the geographical conditions of the port are insufficient. The future development goals should adopt three methods: (1) improve fisheries, (2) reclaim wasteland, and (3) improve salt production. The Department of Civil Affairs and Construction has repeatedly urged by the Provincial Assembly to handle the matter and has recently conducted preliminary consultations. As a result, the Department of Construction has drafted the following two measures: (1) organize an inspection group of Sanmen Bay, inviting experts to form it, and it must depart soon; (2) organize a Sanmen Bay Construction Committee, responsible for regular planning, investigation, and other work. The above measures have been approved by Chairman Shen. Commissioner Gong Peicheng is responsible for the inspection group.</p>
<h3>Decline in Business in Wujin; Three Cloth Stores Close Down</h3>
<p>[Our Wujin Dispatch] Business in Wujin has been very sluggish for the past six months. Before the Mid-Autumn Festival, there were rumors that many businesses were closing, but they struggled through. Although there were a few, such as Yu Kang Silk and Cloth Store, they were in the minority. However, in the past ten days, three cloth stores have successively closed down, attracting social attention. The first to declare bankruptcy was Yuanhetai Cloth Store on Fuzhi Street, with total losses reaching 30 million yuan. Shareholders Liu Bingsheng, Cheng Bingcheng, and Liu Wensheng came forward to handle the matter and settled by paying 60% of the debt. On the 14th and 15th, Dingxin and Dafeng Cloth Stores in Xiyingli also suddenly announced their closure. It is reported that Dingxin's total losses exceeded 80 million yuan. The manager of the store, Ni Zhiming, on the morning of the day before the closure (the 13th), even used a payment receipt from the Silk Industry Bank to purchase ten pieces of 20-count Six Crane yarn and fifty bolts of Blue Butterfly fine cloth from the Dacheng Yarn Factory in the county. He then hired a cart to transport the yarn and cloth in two trips. Unexpectedly, that afternoon, Dacheng suddenly received a phone call from the Silk Industry Bank notifying them that Dingxin's payment was a bounced check. The factory immediately sent someone to Dingxin to investigate. Manager Ni Zhiming had already fled, and the yarn was nowhere to be found. After a thorough investigation, it was discovered that Ni Zhiming had used other names to secretly store seven pieces of yarn at the residence of a Mr. Gu at No. 32 Zhouqian Lane. The police station was notified and went to retrieve the yarn, recovering all seven pieces. The rest is still under investigation. People in society generally believe that this is close to fraud, arbitrary bankruptcy, and an attempt to profit personally. They hope that the authorities will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Fishing</h3>
<p>First Catch is Abundant</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 18th] The winter fishing season has arrived. Zhejiang fishermen have set out for the first time. According to a telegram from the County Magistrate of Dinghai to Chairman Zhu, the first catch was very large. The coast is peaceful, and there have been no disasters. However, in order to strengthen winter defenses and ensure the peak fishing season after December, the Dinghai Water Police Bureau has sent personnel to Shanghai to purchase five landing craft, costing approximately 60 million yuan. Then, winter coastal defense can be worry-free.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou City</h3>
<p>Planning to Build Roads</p>
<p>[Our Yangzhou Dispatch] The Jiangdu County Government, recognizing that Yangzhou is a distribution center for merchants from dozens of counties in northern Jiangsu and, in terms of geographical location, is a springboard for southern and northern Jiangsu, separated from the provincial capital Zhenjiang by only a river, feels that the existing streets in the city are too narrow. Not only are there frequent congestion problems for pedestrians and vehicles, but when it rains, vehicles splash mud everywhere, causing suffering to everyone. This month, there is a plan to build roads in the city. On the 15th, the county government announced the above plan. There are five planned construction routes. Among them, the Jia-type route, which uses Yunsishi Street, Jiaochang Street, and Jimen Bridge as the standard, is more likely to be adopted because this route is the existing commercial and industrial center of Yangzhou. Furthermore, it has been found that the length of this route is two kilometers, and the total construction cost is estimated to be over 2 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Jinan Embankment Breach Under Repair</h3>
<p>[Our Zheng Yangguan Correspondent] The Jinan dike branch in Yingshang breached during the Yellow River floods, inundating Jiangkou, Yiwu, Xiaji, and over ten other townships. Now, with the water level gradually receding, the county government convened the Jinan Embankment Breach Restoration Committee on the 6th to prevent further flooding. It was decided to build a crescent-shaped embankment outside the breach, requiring 300 large stakes, 4,000 catties of firewood, 400 large sacks, 500 catties of hemp, 40 net rolls, and 59,500 cubic meters of earthwork. 2,600 workers were assigned proportionally to eight townships: Yiwu, Xiaqiao, Longji, Xieqiao, Donggucheng, Jiangkou, Ganluo, and Yejing. Construction commenced on the 15th and is expected to be completed by the 2nd of next month.</p>
<h3>Military Officer Corps - Ministry of National Defense Dispatches Inspectors</h3>
<p>Yu Wen Arrives in Suzhou, Now Headed to Nanxun</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Correspondent, 18th] To ensure proper placement of military officers from various heavy officer corps and to understand the conditions of garrisoned troops in various provinces and cities, the Ministry of National Defense has dispatched over 30 supervisory officers to inspect provinces and cities nationwide. Major General Yu Wen, Suzhou district supervisory officer, arrived in Suzhou on the morning of the 18th. When inspecting the Parachute Corps, our reporter happened to be present. Mr. Yu informed us that his primary task is to inspect the 29th Military Officer Corps, seeking a thorough understanding of their living conditions, personnel matters, and training. Furthermore, they plan to rigorously assess the capabilities of surplus officers. The central government intends to select outstanding personnel to supplement cadres and officers in various troops. Those of lesser ability will be selected based on their aptitude and willingness to participate in training courses in agriculture, fisheries, land administration, and other fields. If they prefer to transfer to agriculture, they may also be permitted to retire, to be recalled when the nation requires. We have learned that because the 29th Military Officer Corps has moved from Suzhou to Nanxun, Mr. Yu will depart on the 19th and engage in a longer period of work with the corps in Nanxun.</p>
<h3>Self-Defense Team Robbed in Zheng Yangguan Suburbs</h3>
<p>[Our Zheng Yangguan Correspondent] To strengthen public security, the local authorities deployed the Third Self-Defense Platoon to Liuzikou (15 li west of Zheng Yangguan). On the 14th, dozens of bandits suddenly attacked the platoon headquarters at midnight. The sentries, caught off guard, were unable to respond effectively. Over 20 firearms were seized, and the platoon leader was abducted.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Commences Winter Defense</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Correspondent] The Provincial Police Department, considering Zhenjiang's proximity to the capital and Shanghai, has formulated a winter defense plan to enhance winter security and ensure public order. It was issued to various branch bureaus and stations, and uniformly implemented from the 16th. Furthermore, the Provincial Security Command, noting that banditry in various parts of the province has not been completely eradicated, has ordered all districts, counties, cities, and security and water police forces to strengthen vigilance during the winter defense period and avoid negligence. The command recently telegraphed all counties to comply and issued a copy of the "Outline for Implementing Winter Defense in Various Districts, Counties, and Cities of This Province," ordering its conscientious implementation and reporting.</p>
<h3>Two Robbers of the Yongli Steamer Arrested - Once Escaped While Being Transported</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Correspondent] On September 9th, the Yongli steamer, sailing from Songjiang to Suzhou, was robbed by armed bandits in the vicinity of Huangtiandang in Jiaozhi town, Suzhou territory, resulting in a loss of tens of millions of yuan. After months of pursuit by the Suzhou military and police authorities, a portion of the perpetrators and stolen goods were captured in Lanxi, Zhejiang. On the 16th, the Wudi Procuratorate welcomed them back to Suzhou. A brief account of the circumstances is as follows: There were five robbers involved in the case: Liu Cai, Mao Xiufa, Zhou Changfa, who are still at large, and Zhou Biao and Wang Zhenhua, who have been arrested. All are members of the Jiaozhi Self-Defense Team. On that day, they were ordered to collect rent in Xietang, carrying a submachine gun, a Mauser pistol, and two short guns. While traveling approximately two li from Xietang, they encountered the Yongli steamer and opened fire, forcing it to stop. They boarded the ship and robbed it, sparing no jewelry or clothing of male or female passengers. After looting, they fled towards Jiangxi. Later, the Jiaozhi Self-Defense Squad Leader, Hu De, discovered their trail and led his troops to track them down to the Lanxi Railway Station in Zhejiang, where they intercepted the two robbers, Zhou Biao and Wang Zhenhua, and two suitcases of stolen goods. They were temporarily detained at the Lanxi District Court. Upon receiving the report, the Wudi Court dispatched judicial police to escort them back. However, when the train arrived at the Zhuang station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, at night, Zhou and Wang took advantage of the darkness and jumped off the train in an attempt to escape. The judicial police discovered this and gave chase. After a thrilling chase between police and robbers, they were recaptured at dawn in a haystack in a farmhouse more than ten li from the station. At 5:00 PM on the 16th, they were escorted back to Suzhou. After interrogation by the prosecutor, they were ordered to be detained, and the pursuit of the remaining perpetrators was ordered.</p>
<h3>Black Terror in Quzhou - Plague-like Cases Discovered in the City - People Fear the Plague on Streets and Alleys</h3>
<p>[Our Quzhou Express News] The black terror that once gripped hearts and minds has returned to Quzhou. Recently, plague-like cases have been discovered in the city. In just five days, a twelve-year-old surnamed Zhou on Nanshi Street, a ten-year-old surnamed Fan at No. 21 Tongjia Lane, and a young man of unknown surname at the entrance of Wusheng Lane have all died after contracting the disease. Rats recently died at the Zhouhuang Temple, and the temple caretaker's child fell ill and died on the same day. The deceased first experienced chills, followed by high fever, vomiting, and swelling of the lymph nodes in the armpits and other areas, symptoms highly similar to the plague. As the news spread, people on the streets and in the alleys were all talking about the plague and fearing it. Upon learning of this, the authorities convened an emergency epidemic prevention meeting on the 11th and decided on several emergency countermeasures: (1) Conduct household censuses to prevent people from concealing those afflicted with the disease, (2) Establish isolation hospitals, (3) Establish an epidemic prevention committee. The epidemic prevention committee was established on the 13th, but medical resources are severely lacking.</p>

<h3>Allocation of Goods Needs to Be Practical</h3>
<p>We, the humble people, have suffered physically and mentally throughout the eight years of the War of Resistance. Although we could not fight the enemy on the front lines, we have steadfastly maintained our positions and worked without slackening. After the victory last autumn, we returned to Shanghai, and for the past year, our lives have been threatened. We have passively accepted our fate, waiting patiently for the government to adjust our treatment. Two months ago, the authorities, out of concern for public educators, established the Goods Allocation Office. The intention was good, and we were deeply grateful. Unexpectedly, we have already experienced great difficulty in the initial allocation of food boxes. Recently, we were again allocated one yard of melton cloth, but the selling price exceeded the retail price of the China Textile Corporation (as reported in other newspapers yesterday). The strangest thing is that when we went to the so-called "Zhongxing Military Uniform Factory" to have it measured, upon arriving at the location (No. 17 Fuchang Lane, Xizang Road, Edward Road), there were only three people sitting in the side room (which was borrowed from someone else's house). The measurements were extremely unclear. When asked how many days it would take to complete the work and whether the remaining material could be returned, the answer was: "There is no fixed date, the sewing fee is only 30,000 yuan, and the remaining material must cover the loss of the sewing fee and cannot be returned." Since we have already suffered from the initial allocation of food boxes, we cannot help but hesitate. We hope that the Allocation Office will pay attention to the interests of public educators and correct the following three points:</p>
<p>(1) The contractor should sincerely serve the public. (2) A deadline should be set for garment completion. (3) The cloth should be negotiated with the manufacturer to reduce the wholesale price and refund the balance (Wang Guoliang)</p>
<h3>Many Unemployed Become Petty Thieves</h3>
<p>Recently, burglaries and break-ins have been occurring frequently in the alleys and neighborhoods of northern Shanghai. A few days ago, my neighbor in the alley was robbed, and unfortunately, my own home was also stolen from yesterday. Clothes, miscellaneous items, water bottles, copper pendants, lead buckets, and kerosene stoves were all taken. Although the loss is small, the cost of replacing them is considerable. In the current economic downturn and with so many unemployed, jobless vagrants are forced into theft to survive, and residents cannot sleep peacefully at night. I hope that the police authorities in the northern district will increase patrols in the dark, quiet alleys at night and pay close attention to pedestrians who appear flustered and are carrying packages. At the same time, I also hope that residents of the northern district will close their front and back doors early in the evening and inspect them again before going to bed. If there is any noise late at night, they should get up and observe. Those with locks installed on their alley gates should close them early in the evening or leave only a small door for one person to enter and exit. By being vigilant and defending ourselves, we can curb the theft. (Yushi)</p>
<h3>Huainan Coal Mine Railway - Doing Its Best in the Cracks</h3>
<p>[Our Hefei Correspondent] I arrived at Jiulonggang Station, the location of the Huainan Coal Mine Railway Bureau, on a freight train on the evening of the 11th. In the dark night, the red glow of the coal coking furnace in the mining area soared into the sky, and flames and smoke spewed from the chimney. On the 12th, I visited the Tianjia'an Power Plant. Under the leadership of Mr. Li Rongbao, the head of the electrical engineering section, who "came from electrical engineering (self-taught)," the 2,000-kilowatt generator roared and turned, supplying power to the mining area with a diameter of ten kilometers for coal mining. A new generator is waiting to be installed, which will double the power supply after completion. The old power plant is busy dismantling and repairing the generator, and the sound of technicians chiseling and excavating the rusty turbine blades is incessant.</p>
<p>I then went to the three main production areas of the Huainan Coal Mine. Under the guidance of engineer Zhang Youxian, the hoists in the mine shafts rose and fell frequently, fully loaded with coal rising out of the shaft. The daily coal production reached 1,800 tons. The wall of the new No. 3 well in the West Mine has reached a depth of 200 meters underground. In two years, this well can produce 2,000 tons per day. The East Mine factory has 18 coking furnaces, which use the Pingxiang Yu's method of coking, producing 300 tons per month to supply the sand-casting factories in Beijing and Shanghai. The mine bureau has nearly 10,000 workers, who live with their families in 3,000 workshops.</p>
<p>On the 13th, I visited the Railway Bureau, led by Deputy Director Ning Shufan. Currently, the railway bureau extends 88 kilometers from Bengbu through Shuijiahu to Tianjia'an. Among them, the 26-kilometer section from Tianshui is the old Huainan Railway, and the Yongbeng section was built by the Japanese army and repaired for traffic on June 1st of this year. The entire line has 15 locomotives, over 200 passenger, freight, and coal cars. There are two passenger and freight trains running daily between Tianbeng and two coal trains running between Pukou and Tianjia'an daily, transporting 1,500 tons of coal and coke. Sometimes, coal trucks still need to cross the Yangtze River to Wuxi to supply coal to the Qishuyan Power Plant. The Jiulonggang Machine Factory, which belongs to the Railway Bureau, is headed by Liu Xinmin. It can repair two locomotives at the same time. Using waste materials abandoned by the Japanese, it has manufactured two passenger cars and twenty freight cars. The Equipment Depot, where Director Lu Fengshan of the Mechanical Affairs Department received piles of iron scrap abandoned by the Japanese, has now been organized into an orderly material warehouse. The equipment of the factory can be said to be complete, but it is eager to supplement a 50-ton crane as a giant arm for hoisting and repairing locomotives. The Engineering Department is planning the 188-kilometer track restoration project from Shuijiahu to Yuxikou. Director Li Jingshu, when mentioning the track restoration, had a particularly radiant look in his eyes. It is estimated that five kilometers of track will be laid per day, and the widest Zhugao River bridge will be built, etc. Full line traffic can be guaranteed in six months. After this line is opened to traffic, it will not only provide a Yangtze River export for Huainan coal sales, but also provide a cheap export route for grain, cotton, tobacco, and other products from the fertile central Anhui villages along the 300-kilometer route. It is currently hoped that the steel rails, sleepers, and bridges approved by the Ministry of Communications will arrive soon.</p>
<p>I then visited the employee welfare facilities. The hospital is headed by Director Wang Zhizhong. The dental equipment rivals that of Beijing and Shanghai. There are currently 20 beds. Surgical operations can be performed for appendectomies and complicated deliveries. A worker from Yi Chaohao had his bladder and urethra crushed by a train in the fog, and his life was in danger, but he was saved by surgery and is currently being treated. The hospital had 100 beds before the war and plans to restore 50 beds first. It is hoped that the Executive Yuan can allocate equipment and medicines, and an X-ray machine is urgently needed. The commercial center has departments for haircutting, laundry, sewing, and photography, with fees lower than the market price. There is a primary school with over 1,300 students, and a first-year junior high school and a Datong branch school.</p>
<p>The employees of the Railway Bureau all work above ground, and their physique, clothing, and spirit are very full. The employees of the Mine Bureau work hard 300 meters below the surface, sacrificing their own lives and health for the light of Beijing and Shanghai, resulting in a miserable scene in the workshop area. The total number of employees in the Railway and Mine Bureaus is 13,000. In addition to producing 50,000 tons of coal per day, transporting 100,000 tons of coal and cargo, and carrying 200,000 passengers, they are also busy installing new generators, flour mills, and new mine shafts. The work is in full swing, and everyone is immersed in practical work. Although the salaries of staff and workers are higher than those of civil servants, and they have housing and free electricity and coal supply, they have been able to remain honest and self-disciplined since the takeover, and their lives are simple. Therefore, they can contribute every drop to the public. And because they are located in the gap between northeastern Anhui and the Dabie Mountains, they are constantly threatened by the communist forces that run east and west, and they further develop the spirit of using the power grid bunkers to protect the mine and the road. In September, led by two geological experts, Xie Jiarong and Chai Dengbang, they explored a new coal-bearing stratum at Xinzhuangzi, Fengtai, 17 kilometers from Jiulonggang. A 120-meter drill hole found four layers of coal, totaling more than six meters thick, giving Huainan Mine a new national base and further increasing the future prospects of the Mine Road.</p>

<h3>Labor Party Splinter Faction Sparks a Storm - British House of Commons Debates Foreign Policy - Prime Minister Attlee Attends to Defend</h3>
<p>[Our Special Correspondent, London, 18th] The British House of Commons held a heated debate today on whether British foreign policy should be amended. Prime Minister Attlee stated in his speech that the time has come to vote on amending foreign policy. Mr. Attlee added that since all the riots occurred, several thousand people have died and 14,000 have been injured. At the time of reporting, the debate on amending foreign policy is still ongoing.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 17th] When the House of Commons meets tomorrow to discuss the amendment to foreign policy proposed by the "rebellious" members of the Labor Party, the United States may become the target of public criticism. A portion of the rebel faction, advocating an independent socialist policy, is expected to criticize the United States with the same intensity that the U.S. Congress criticized Britain when discussing loans to Britain. "The Observer" newspaper summarized the concerns of the rebel faction, stating that they believe that Britain's close economic ties with the United States will make it difficult for Britain to escape the inevitable trend of capitalism, from prosperity to decline. If Britain is closely linked with the United States in politics and diplomacy, it will lead to the division of the world into two major blocs, which will inevitably lead to war. Most Labor Party members feel that the rise of the Republican Party in the United States is equivalent to the rise of big business. Among the Labor Party members who have been the most critical of Bevin's foreign policy, Dugu delivered a speech today, predicting tomorrow's debate. It is said that "ignorant and small-minded Americans are preaching another war. I want to save the Soviet Union from communism, but the situation across the Atlantic is no less bad, or at least very bad." Another rebel leader stated that the British foreign policy now supported by Churchill is drifting with the tide and is worthless. He and other like-minded people want Britain to stand alone in international affairs and disassociate itself from the United States. Most observers believe that if the rebel members continue to criticize, Prime Minister Attlee will demand a vote of confidence, which he will certainly receive with an overwhelming majority.</p>
<h3>Two International Conferences in New York - Now Entering a Tense Stage - Five Major Powers Meet to Discuss Limiting the Use of the Veto - The German Question Will Be Included on the Agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Special Correspondent, New York, 18th] At 11:00 a.m. today, the five powers met to seek an agreement on the issue of limiting the veto power. Prior to that, the four foreign ministers had discussed the Trieste issue, but to date, the results of the negotiations have not been disclosed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 18th] The political and economic discussions at the Foreign Ministers' Meeting and the United Nations Conference will enter a tense stage this week. Observers have also not neglected today's foreign policy debate in the British House of Commons. People within the British side are deeply uneasy about the Labor Party members' criticism of foreign policy at this moment, as Bevin is not only conducting negotiations on drafting a peace treaty here, but also concurrently handling various important negotiations with the Foreign Office, Treasury, Department of Commerce, and Ministry of Food, the results of which have a significant impact on Britain. The success or failure of the negotiations between the United States and Britain on merging the economies of the two German zones is even more related to Britain's overall economic situation. On the political front, today's five-power meeting will discuss the five powers voluntarily limiting the use of the veto power, and the agenda following the Foreign Ministers' Meeting, including the German question, will also be submitted for discussion today. The four-power Foreign Ministers' Meeting is scheduled to open at 9:00 p.m. to continue discussing the Trieste issue.</p>

<p>[International News Service, Key West, Florida, 17th] President Truman is taking a six-day vacation, but is closely monitoring the threat of a coal miners' strike.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 18th] President Truman today ordered an all-out confrontation with John L. Lewis, President of the United Mine Workers of America, to avert a coal miners' strike on the 21st of this month. The government has urged 400,000 coal miners to continue working as usual, declaring that the contract they have with the government, which has owned the coal mines since January, will remain in effect for one more day. The Bureau of Mines has ordered leaflets to be posted at 3,300 coal mines, asking miners to respect the contract and continue mining to supply the nation's needs. Previously, President Truman supported a sixty-day truce to allow labor and management to negotiate the contract within the deadline, but this proposal was rejected by Lewis. Lewis has not actually called for a strike, but according to the miners' traditional policy of "no contract, no work," the current contract will expire at midnight on the 20th, and all coal mines will cease operations starting on the 21st.

These vintage cars drove on the old road from London to Brighton today, creating a cacophony of clanging and rattling, with crowds of spectators cheering on both sides. Although there was a heavy frost today, the drivers were able to start the engines, which can also be considered a miracle.</p>
<h3>U.S. Economy Will Inevitably Decline After Peak; Crisis to Occur Next Spring</h3>
<p>Predictions from Domestic Issues Experts</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 17th] After studying the national purchasing and production situation, American domestic issues experts predict that the first post-war economic fluctuation will occur next spring, but a large-scale fluctuation must wait until two years later. However, the economic fluctuation that will occur next spring will inevitably affect the country and even abroad. The United States has reached a boom period. The number of people employed and the number of unemployed people have reached unprecedented records in the United States. The national income has broken all records, and the production figures have also exceeded all previous figures. Therefore, this is a real boom phenomenon, and an opposite fluctuation will inevitably occur sooner or later. However, some optimistic Americans believe that Americans' purchasing power is still ample. During the war, life was tight, and people had a lot of savings. After the war, the demand for various items increased greatly, and the boom phenomenon can be maintained for a considerable period. On the other hand, some people also point out the unreliability of this theory. They put forward two facts to prove it: one is that the increase in wartime savings is not universal. In fact, only 10% of the people have a lot of savings, and the remaining 90% of the people have a few savings in the bank, but it is definitely not enough to cope with the increase in prices; The sharp rise in prices means that purchasers will soon reach a point where, although they need to buy, they are unwilling, and unable to buy one day. Several manufacturing businesses have already discovered this trend. American experts also said that there are two possibilities to avoid the economic crisis next spring: (1) Each industrial federation should unite and adopt a policy of not raising prices, or even reducing prices; (2) Due to the occurrence of labor strikes, wages will also increase accordingly, so that workers can cope with rising living expenses, but this is a temporary delay policy, and ultimately, a worse economic crisis will inevitably break out. Foreign markets may enable many manufacturers to overcome the difficulties of next spring, but if the government cannot adopt better policies to reconcile American manpower, production, and world needs, a situation worse than next spring will inevitably come.</p>
<h3>Japan in the Occupation Period (Part 2) The Occupation Work is Divided into Three Stages</h3>
<p>— Original by Parrott, New York Times Tokyo Correspondent; Translated by Zhang Deqian</p>
<p>Every thoughtful Japanese knows that cooperation is the only way out in today's environment, even the remnants of militarists who may still be hiding underground hoping that "Der Tag" (German: That Day) will come soon think so too. The sooner the occupation ends, the sooner the various parties and factions in Japan will have the opportunity to engage in their respective political activities, especially those in the extremist factions. The conservative Asahi Shimbun, which has the largest circulation in Japan, once succinctly stated: "Whether the occupation can be completed in a short period depends on whether the occupation forces can cooperate smoothly with the Japanese people." In other words, the greater the degree of cooperation, the faster the occupation will end.</p>
<p>There are several important factors to consider. First, the occupation authorities conducted extensive investigations and found no organized underground activities. Second, Japanese liberals support the system we have provided and intend to promote its implementation. However, there is another group of people (it is impossible to estimate how many) who are heartbroken, full of resentment, and waiting for the opportunity to rebuild the old feudal politics. There is also a group of people pursuing a Soviet-style violent revolution, and the now quite widespread Communist propaganda is mainly aimed at this group.</p>
<p>One noteworthy factor is that the most simple Japanese people proved in April this year that they can indeed engage in democratic elections. When they were allowed to vote freely, they expressed significantly different political views, from pure communism to the extent permitted by the occupation forces. One of the people who received the most votes was later disqualified by MacArthur's headquarters as an undesirable person, namely Ichiro Hatoyama, leader of the Liberal Party.</p>
<p>From this significant political consciousness, it can be seen that the influence of the militarist rule on the Japanese people in the past was not as great as generally imagined; at least now, if you want to control them again, they will not be so easily submissive. The Japanese may not pay much attention to theory, although most of them seem willing to sacrifice old traditions to enjoy the new freedom given to them; please see that they voluntarily elected many women as members of the new Diet, although they used to consider women to be inferior. What they need is clothing, food, housing, and considerable political stability, enough to enable them to resume work and have the opportunity to rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>The Japanese have slowly begun to move forward on the road to construction. Japanese cities and towns are promoting construction plans. We see many small wooden houses being rebuilt like bamboo shoots after a spring rain in the ruins destroyed by bombs. One day, Shizuoka City proudly announced that it was the first city in all of Japan to complete a housing project for bombing refugees. Dance halls have reopened. Small shops are piled with simple goods. As the reporter writes this article, there is a group of Japanese children outside the window playing miniature baseball, running, shouting, and laughing. Recently, Tokyo's restaurants have been supplying luxurious meals to a small number of lucky wealthy people, so the government has become even stricter with the price limit for set meals. Shiny cars drive through the streets of Tokyo. They are not the cars of Allied generals. They are Japanese. A year ago, they were hidden in the most secluded places, fearing that they would be taken away by the occupation forces. But if you want to buy one of these cars, the price asked in Japanese Yen is almost equal to the mileage from Earth to Mars. No one has any confidence in the Japanese Yen. Inflation is constantly ongoing.</p>
<p>Japan's industry, which could have absorbed those unemployed people, is affected by the unresolved reparations issue. If a factory is to be dismantled and shipped abroad in the future to pay off war debts, the Japanese are obviously unwilling to rebuild, repair, renovate, or expand it in order to find work for the unemployed.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida once spoke in the Diet, using the simplest terms to explain that post-war Japan must maintain 70% of its pre-war population, with only 56% of its pre-war land, and must reduce multiple products, now have to import from abroad, and pay with industrial products. This is really the most basic problem of all problems.</p>
<p>As the occupation enters its second year, whether the Allies can obtain an answer to these many problems (the United Nations often has many similar problems in their own countries that cannot be resolved) is really a "gamble," not only for MacArthur but also for the entire Western world.</p>

<h3>Two Factories in Western Shanghai Destroyed by Fire; Burning for Three Hours; Losses Difficult to Estimate</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Hwa Foong Rubber Goods Factory, located at 54 Pan Chia Zhai, Tun Hsin Road, Western Shanghai, specializing in the manufacture of galoshes, running shoes, sneakers, etc., and its adjacent neighbor, 55 Wang Te Kee Waste Cotton Factory. Yesterday at about 5:10 PM, a fire suddenly broke out. Immediately, thick smoke soared, and flames erupted in all directions. The fire was extinguished at 8:30 PM. Afterwards, it was learned that the Hwa Foong Rubber Factory was burned down twenty-odd factory buildings, over ten large and small machines (rated at 280 horsepower). A large number of semi-finished products, raw materials, etc., were all burned. Losses exceeded 160 to 170 million yuan. The Wang Te Kee Cotton Factory was burned down four to five thousand dan of waste cotton, over ten factory buildings and all the engines, motors, machinery and other business assets, at the time the loss was difficult to estimate. The fire department arrived in minutes after the fire started, but there was no large fire hydrant inside Pan Chia Zhai and so water was piped from a spot one li away on the road, but the goods stored in the two plants—one waste cotton, one rubber, and sundries—were highly flammable, so once lit, the inferno could not be approached. Fortunately, no one was injured. As for the cause of the fire, which factory was the origin, the Changning Police Bureau is currently investigating.</p>
<h3>Three Houses Burned in Mao Jia Nong; Fire at Cigarette Factory Injures People</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday afternoon at 5:10, a fire broke out at 27 Sheng Chi Li, Mao Chia Nong, outside the Tatung Gate in Southern Shanghai. Tenant Tang Jui-Fu, 27 of Zhenjiang, was using an air pump carelessly, causing the fire. Tang was momentarily panicked and did not extinguish the fire, instead fleeing, causing a disaster. In addition to the complete destruction of 27, the fire spread to 28 and 29. Also, because the residents there had no electric lighting facilities, most used kerosene lamps. Therefore, each household had an average of one and a half boxes of kerosene, and thus it added fuel to the fire and it was unstoppable. Despite the firefighters of the Nanshi Fire Department fighting to save the fire, the fire was extinguished only at 8:30, with considerable loss. The originator Tang Jui-Fu has been arrested by the police bureau, and is currently under investigation.</p>

<h3>Two Days of War Criminals Indicted by Military Tribunal for Abusing Allied Prisoners of War</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Military Tribunal has learned: Japanese war criminals Odera Satoshi (male, 58 years old, from Kagoshima, Japan, former director of the Japanese Army Shanghai Haifang Road Prisoner of War Camp) and Kida Dou (male, 30 years old, from Tokyo, Japan, former chief of general affairs of the Japanese Army Shanghai Haifang Road Prisoner of War Camp) have been accused of abusing Allied prisoners of war. The tribunal has investigated and confirmed the facts and formally filed a public prosecution yesterday, with a trial to be held soon. In early November 1942, the Japanese army concentrated Allied nationals in Shanghai and detained them in the Haifang Road Prisoner of War Camp, managed by Odera and others. In early July 1945, all the detained nationals in the camp were transported to Fengtai, Hebei, for centralized detention, with Odera and others continuing to be responsible for management. The treatment of prisoners of war violated the international conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war during wartime. For example, there was insufficient food, the sick were not isolated, prisoners were not allowed to take refuge during air raids, Red Cross packages were stolen, prisoners' letters were withheld, forced salutes, beatings of prisoners, overcrowding in vehicles during prisoner transport, four-day journeys without sleep, and unsanitary facilities in the camp. There are dozens of accusations and crime investigation reports from former Allied prisoners of war, including Jin, Hill, Thompson, Willing, Berg, and Frederick, as well as statements from witnesses Hillman, Bizzi, and Wang Jisheng, a nurse at the former Ward Road Police Hospital. The defendants violated Articles 10, 11, 13, 14, 26, 36, 44, and 46 of the International Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War During Wartime and should be punished according to Article 2, Paragraph 2, and Article 3, Paragraph 29 of the Wartime Criminals Trial Regulations, combined with Article 26, Paragraph 1, second half, of the same regulations.

<h3>Legal Procedures for Purchasing Blood Plasma, Responsibility Not with Merchants, Lida Trading Expresses Willingness to Return, but Must Be Reimbursed Reasonable Price</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Since the discovery of the false sale of American blood　 on the market, all sectors have paid close attention to it, and both Chinese and American authorities have ordered a thorough investigation of the truth. According to reporters' inquiries from various parties, the sale of this blood plasma does not seem to qualify as a "black market." Because the foreign merchant purchased it from the American Materials Clearing Committee through legal procedures, if the blood plasma should not be sold in the market, the responsibility does not lie with the merchant. Now the American side hopes to buy back the blood plasma at a price, and the merchant side has also expressed its willingness to do its utmost to assist.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of Lida International Trading, the company that purchased the blood plasma, the American Materials Clearing Committee sent the company a list of pharmaceutical supply items in April this year, totaling more than 100 pages, including various drugs, and blood plasma was clearly listed. The company then placed an order with the American side based on this list of items, and all the payment was remitted to the U.S. Treasury. The total weight of the drugs was 10,000 tons, and the purchase price was 1.65 million U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>The company has now stopped selling blood plasma and expressed its willingness to return all the inventory, but the Clearing Committee should pay a reasonable price to avoid losses for the company. As of yesterday, the two sides had not yet agreed on the amount of the price. The inventory in the warehouse is being closely monitored by the U.S. Navy.</p>

<h3>Difficult Estate Tax Valuation, China Trust Bureau Assists</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Direct Taxation Bureau is actively working on the collection of estate tax, but the investigation work is quite time-consuming, and valuation is also difficult. It is now planned to ask the China Trust Bureau to assist in valuation. Currently, the highest amount of estate tax paid is only more than 200,000 yuan, but there are cases under investigation that amount to hundreds of millions of yuan. Because the estate tax is a progressive tax with 18 levels, those exceeding 100 million yuan are taxed at 60% on the excess. The Direct Taxation Bureau hopes that all sectors will voluntarily pay estate tax to obtain inheritance protection. At the same time, it encourages whistleblowing, and if the investigation is verified, a bonus of 2% will be issued.</p>

<h3>Improving Telephone Efficiency, Adopting Unified Automatic System, Plan to Increase Users to More Than 130,000 Lines Within Five Years</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Works Bureau, Shanghai is an international commercial port, and the city's neural center, the telephone system, should have a unified and rational system to increase efficiency, facilitate management, and reduce costs. The plan to improve the city's telephone technology has been submitted to the Executive Yuan. To make Shanghai's telephone system rational, the basic step is to adopt a unified automatic switching system, replacing the step-by-step system with a rotary system. At the same time, the Shanghai urban area will be divided into inner and outer areas. The inner area includes the existing business and industrial areas with telephone supply, that is, the old concession, Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, and the outskirts of Shanghai will be designated as suburban areas. Within five years, the central area is planned to have 133,800 lines of users, and a six-digit number will be used. The telephone operating agency also needs to be unified.</p>
<h3>Fish Market Lending Capital to Buy Fish Causes Outside Criticism, Tang Chengzong Issues Statement</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fish Market has been criticized for setting up a temporary office in Shenjiamen to lend capital to large fishing boats to buy fish. This matter has also been published in small local newspapers in this port and in Ningbo. According to Tang Chengzong, general manager of the market, the reports are largely inconsistent with the facts. It has always been the custom in Shenjiamen that large fishing boats must borrow capital from fish merchants before going out to sea, and fish merchants who want to buy fresh fish locally also regard lending capital as their duty. In recent years, due to the sluggish business of fish merchants, large fishing boats have had difficulty borrowing capital and have been unable to go out to sea in time, resulting in a decline in production. In response to the requests of all parties concerned about the fishing industry, the market reluctantly raised 200 million yuan of operating funds to lend capital to large fishing boats to buy fish, which was originally intended to supplement the situation. However, due to limited financial resources, the amount was too small to be widely loaned, and because the organization was simple, it was unable to recruit more talented people recommended by all parties, resulting in dissatisfaction among those who were not selected, who said that the interest rate of 10% per month was usury that exploited fishermen. In fact, the stipulated interest rate is 6% per month, which is not much less than the interbank lending rate, and there is not little compensation already. It is also said that the loans are contracted by a small number of fish shops, but in fact, all loans are directly approved by the office and not handled by others. Furthermore, it is said that the amount of 200 million yuan is used to take advantage of the Farmers Bank's fishing loans. In fact, the Farmers Bank handles fishing loans by lending directly to households, and they are due in succession as early as May and June. The funds released by this market are part of the market's operating funds, which must be recovered successively when buying fish. The two are completely different and cannot be confused. What is rumored to the outside world is purely a misunderstanding. However, the market is carrying out this work to regulate the production and sales of fish. Since the decline of the fishing industry has not been resolved, the market's established policy will continue to be implemented seriously. If all sectors have good intentions to give instructions, we will sincerely welcome them.</p>

<h3>Central Bank Employee Commits Suicide by Lying on Tracks, Body Crushed into Two Sections</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Guan Guocui, an employee of the Exchange Section of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, had an elderly mother and wife.

However, after finishing work on the morning of the 16th, Guan went to the North Railway Station alone and wandered near the railway. At about 1 p.m., a train entered the station, and Dong lay down on the track. Although the driver tried to stop the train, it was too late and he was crushed into two sections. Nothing could be more tragic than this suicide. Afterwards, someone asked a senior official of the Central Bank: "The Central Bank has always had very generous salaries for its employees. How could they be forced to commit suicide due to livelihood?" He replied: "He is a countryman. This time, he was actually unfamiliar with the road and was knocked down by the train, not suicide."</p>

The entire case was transferred to the District Attorney's Office yesterday for investigation. The cracking of this case took a long time. As early as May 1st of this year, when U.S. Army Colonel Crown's private car was parked at the intersection of Yanan Road and Huating Road at 9 PM, three White Russians (namely Kao Chakov, Makishaev, and Goldfeight) suddenly appeared.

<h3>Mei Lanfang's Drunken Beauty Hasn't Been Seen for Over a Decade: A Masterpiece Will Be Performed Tomorrow Night</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Mei Lanfang's troupe has been warmly welcomed since its performance at the China Grand Theatre. The plays performed are all Mei's carefully crafted masterpieces. The play "Drunken Beauty" is his masterpiece, having been passed down from the late famous actor Lu Sanbao. He does not perform it lightly, which shows its value. Mei has not performed this play for more than ten years. Due to popular demand, it is scheduled to be performed at the theatre tomorrow night. The entire play "Drunken Beauty" is based on the Siping tune, and actors are most afraid of singing Erhuang and Siping. The "body" work includes "soft waist," "lying fish," and "bright fan," which are demanding techniques. The drunken expression must not depart from the identity of the imperial concubine, and limiting the expression is especially difficult. Therefore, this play cannot be performed without innate talent and consummate skill, otherwise it is inevitable to "stink" and give a sense of difficulty without any reward. Mr. Mei's skill is still as good as ever, which is truly commendable. Now that he is leaking the performance of the "Drunken Beauty" that combines singing and acting, it is especially worth celebrating.</p>
<h3>Fireworks Prohibited During Winter Defense Period</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Garrison Department yesterday, during the winter defense period, citizens are strictly prohibited from setting off firecrackers and cannons at night, so as to avoid misunderstandings and prevent petty criminals from taking the opportunity to cause trouble. The Garrison Department will strictly regulate and prohibit this.</p>
<p>Also, Zhang Zhengfu and Zhang Zhengxiang, barbers at 84 Yan'an Road, were arrested for teasing women with firecrackers, and Zhang Zhigao, Shen Zhixiong, and Su Tongqing, employees of a knitting factory at 298 Dongtai Road, were arrested for setting off coal mines, all for violating the law.</p>
<h3>A Total of 982 Lost Children in Ten Months</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to the statistics office of the police bureau yesterday, the total number of lost and missing children in the city from January to October of this year was 982, an average of 98 per month. Among them, 442 were found and taken back by their families, 142 were sent to shelters, 40 were sent to the Jiliang Institute, 8 were sent to the Nursery, 10 were sent to the China Women's Relief Association, 14 were sent to the People's Hospital, and 4 were sent to the Municipal Hospital.</p>
<h3>The 2.7 Billion Yuan Embezzlement Case: CNRRA Sends Letter to District Attorney's Office Requesting Immediate Legal Action; Wu Suiren Is in Shanghai and Has Not Fled</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the case of Wu Suiren, chief of the cashier section of the General Affairs Department of the CNRRA, who embezzled 2.7 billion yuan of public funds for private lending at high interest rates, it is learned that the director of the department, Huo Baoshu, sent a letter to the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office on the 16th of this month to handle the case in accordance with the law. The original letter stated: "It is hereby notified that this office received a telegram from the Nanjing headquarters of this administration on October 20, 1946, stating: 'The Central Bank has remitted 2.7 billion yuan in national currency to the UNRRA resident office as an advance for the expenses of September of this year. Please exchange it and reply by telegram.' We immediately inquired with the Central Bank. According to the bank, the funds were remitted on October 24. While we were inquiring, Wu Suiren, chief of the cashier section of this administration, stated that the above funds had been withdrawn for interest-bearing loans. He was momentarily confused and regretted it deeply. He is willing to return the transferred funds and interest in full.' Considering the large amount of funds, we advised him to return the full amount in order to avoid losses of public funds. To date, the employee has returned the above funds, together with interest of 14.6 million yuan in national currency, to the department for registration. The employee's service has been diligent on weekdays. Although he was momentarily confused this time, he repented afterward and returned all the public funds to the department, without suffering any losses. However, the transfer of public funds is illegal. In addition to being dismissed from his post, we have also sent a letter to the police bureau for investigation. We hereby send a corresponding letter, hoping that you will investigate and handle it in accordance with the law. To the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office. Wu Suiren's address: No. 2, Ruifeng Lane, Dongjiaxing Road, North Sichuan Road, Hongkou."</p>
<p>According to reporters' inquiries at the department, Wu Suiren is still in Shanghai and has not fled. The employee had a guarantor when he joined the department. At the same time, the city police bureau has also filed the case, and it is not easy to escape. Wu Suiren is from Shexian County, Anhui Province, 38 years old, and graduated from Anhui University. In his early years, he served as a section chief in the Guizhou Provincial Government. He joined the CNRRA when it was established in Chongqing.</p>
<h3>CNRRA's Ships Carrying Commercial Goods Were Approved in Advance: Director of the Maritime Administration Bureau Explains the Truth</h3>
<p>CNRRA ships carrying relief supplies often carry commercial goods in their remaining tonnage. The maritime industry in the city is very concerned about this matter and has repeatedly expressed opposition, believing that it damages the rights of shipping companies. It is also learned that the Yingkou Northeast Maritime Administration Bureau recently detained a CNRRA ship carrying commercial goods and telegraphed the Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau, requesting consultations with Liu Hongsheng, executive director of the CNRRA. According to Li Gufan, director of the Maritime Administration Bureau, the CNRRA replied that the CNRRA ships carrying commercial goods using remaining tonnage had been approved by Premier Song, so it was not an unauthorized action. The Maritime Administration Bureau believed that since Premier Song had already approved it, it should be complied with. In addition to telegraphing the Yingkou Northeast Maritime Administration Bureau to release the detained CNRRA ship, it also notified shipping companies, explaining the truth of the matter. In the future, the Maritime Administration Bureau will uniformly allow CNRRA ships to carry commercial goods.</p>

<h3>Establishment of the Executive Committee of the Import Management Committee: Formulation of Detailed Rules for Implementation; Market is Calm and Responses from All Parties Are Good</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Executive Committee of the Provisional Import Management Committee officially began operations at 8:30 AM yesterday on the third floor of the Central Bank. All members of the executive committee immediately held a meeting. Chairman Bei presided, and all members Li Gan, Zhang Fuyun, Lin Weiying, Chen Changtong, and others attended. They immediately began to formulate and revise the detailed rules and procedures for the implementation of the Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade, as well as public announcements and other matters. Soon after the meeting, Mr. Bei summoned the heads of more than 20 Chinese and foreign banks designated to operate foreign exchange business, informing them that the revised Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade would be implemented immediately and instructing all banks to comply. Finally, the banks raised questions and were answered separately. If the banks have any unresolved questions, they can still submit them in writing in the future. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, all members of the executive committee held another meeting, and by 6:00 PM, all the detailed rules for implementation were formulated. Chen Changtong, member of the executive committee and director of the secretariat, officially announced it to the journalists. (For the full text of the detailed rules, see the advertisement on page 9 of this newspaper). After Chen's report, he participated in the committee's continued meeting until it adjourned at around 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>In order to understand the reactions of all sectors after the promulgation of the revised Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade, our reporter specially interviewed leaders from various Chinese and foreign circles yesterday and inspected the market trends. The interview results are reported as follows:</p>
<p>Xu Jiqing's Views: This Move Can Promote Production Enterprises; It is Sincerely Hoped That Importers Will Not Raise Prices</p>
<p>Xu Jiqing, chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, said: In recent months, imported goods have been dumped in large quantities in China, while exports have been very few. Domestic production enterprises have been hit hard, and the US exchange rate has also been significantly affected. Therefore, the business community often has many criticisms. Now that the revised measures have been promulgated and implemented, unnecessary imports are restricted, and necessary imports are facilitated. Except for those prohibited from export, all exports can be freely exported. This move can promote the production enterprises in our country and will greatly help our country's economic situation. Also, the public officials in charge of this executive committee can be called the best of the time. Each member has rich knowledge and experience, so they should be able to successfully complete the task. However, one point must be noted, that is, goods that have already been imported may take the opportunity to rise in price. It is sincerely hoped that importers will take into account the welfare of the public and not arbitrarily raise prices.</p>
<p>Strengthening the Financial Position and Promoting Economic Stability</p>
<p>Comments from the Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Mr. Keizik, chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, said: The implementation of these revised measures proves the government's determination to maintain and strengthen China's financial position. Prudent and cautious importers often welcome these measures. From a long-term perspective, these measures will stabilize the economic situation. Also, the public officials in charge of the executive committee are all well-known people. However, if these measures are studied in detail, foreign businesses will have three main questions: (1) How will contracts that have already been established be handled? (2) How will the quotas for imported goods without limits be determined? (3) The import of industrial equipment often takes years. Can the Central Bank provide the foreign exchange required for this aspect? Keizik then said: The above is purely from the observations between meetings. As for suggestive comments, it will take some time for this new agency to work before there are any clues.</p>
<p>Comments from Leaders of the American Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Mr. Smith, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce, told reporters in a humorous tone: The arrival of these revised measures seems a bit too hasty. However, due to time constraints, I have not yet had time to study the contents of all the measures in detail. One thing is very clear, that is, a permit must be obtained in advance for each type of imported goods. As for how to apply, how long it will take to apply and issue the permit, and whether the application form has been printed, no one knows yet. Also, how will imported goods that are en route be handled? The military business I run has long been on the list of permitted imports. Therefore, the implementation of the revised measures should not have any impact on my business. However, this import permit system has now been extended to general imported goods.</p>
<p>Application Procedures Should Be Fast; Restriction of Quotas Must Be Fair</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Huanzhang, chairman of the Shanghai Import and Export Commercial Association, said: The current quantity of imported goods is really too large, and most of them are luxury goods and consumables. After the implementation of this measure, what I hope for are the following points: (1) The application procedures for import should be as fast as possible. (2) The restriction of the allocated quota should be as fair as possible. (3) According to the provisions of the measures, importers must register with the Provisional Import Management Committee. However, most importers have already registered with the Import and Export Association, so it is hoped that if they are members of the association, it will be sufficient as proof of registration. (4) It is hoped that some relevant commercial organizations can participate in the current executive committee to avoid barriers. (5) It is hoped that there will be a limit for each type of imported goods. Within the limit, each importer should be allowed to freely allocate the settlement of the import. (6) How to make the allocation of the quota fair is worth considering and researching in detail. He finally said: After the implementation of the revised measures, importers will inevitably increase the difficulty. Because now when ordering from abroad, there may not be goods immediately after ordering. If a permit is required before ordering, it is even more difficult to know whether the goods to be ordered will still be available after the permit is obtained.</p>
<p>Hope That the Implementation Measures Will Achieve Their Well-Intended Purpose</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Yujiu, executive director of the China Import and Export Trade Association, said: The promulgation of the revised measures is tantamount to giving the domestic industrial production sector an opportunity to recover. For example, restricting the import of non-essential goods and facilitating the import of production machines are all very good intentions. However, it is hoped that the authorities will clearly distinguish between goods that are permitted for import and those that are not. The application procedures for goods that are permitted for import should be simplified as much as possible to facilitate rapid import. For goods that are not permitted for import, it is better to simply prohibit their import, and not adopt passive restrictive measures. On the one hand, they still accept applications, and on the other hand, they delay the date of approval for import, which only inconveniences merchants. Zhang then said: The intention of establishing any control measures is always good. It is sincerely hoped that after the implementation of these measures, they can fully achieve their well-intended purpose. Regarding the export issue, Zhang put forward two hopes: (1) Find ways to reduce domestic production costs, (2) Hope that the Chinese people will not depreciate and dump goods in foreign markets to avoid reducing the export price of Chinese goods and causing losses to the country and the people.</p>
<p>Rescuing the Industrial and Commercial Crisis and Loosening Foreign Exchange Positions</p>
<p>Mr. Qiu Liangrong, the person in charge of the China Import and Export Trade Association, said that the implementation of the revised measures will greatly benefit the industrial sector of this city. The threat of competition from foreign goods can be reduced as a result. At the same time, the government has also agreed to issue industrial loans, which will help to rescue the industrial and commercial crisis in this city. In addition, the government can provide more protection for the allocation of foreign exchange. Qiu believes that in the past, when China purchased imported goods, importers often bought goods blindly, which was equivalent to rushing to buy goods. As a result, most importers lost money. After adopting the permit import system, this abnormal import situation can be improved a lot. Qiu said that most of the current import and export firms in the city are newly established organizations. Some import firms with a long history have not joined the association as members, and they often operate several kinds of imported goods at the same time. Therefore, the standards for registering importers and the allocation of quotas need to be carefully considered. According to Qiu's observation, the most important issue after the implementation of the revised measures is smuggling. The sources of smuggling are: (1) Hong Kong, (2) Shanghai imported merchant ships. It is expected that due to quota restrictions, the price of goods that cannot be permitted for import will rise, and the profits will be greater. Where there is profit, merchants will find ways to smuggle, so the government should pay close attention to this.</p>
<h3>The Market Prices of US Dollars and Gold Both Fell Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After the administrative authorities announced the implementation of the population permit system, the black market prices of US dollars and gold both fell yesterday. However, experienced observers said that unless the import permit system is effectively implemented and smuggling can be eradicated, the black market price of US dollars will still rise; gold will also rise with the US dollar, but due to pressure from the Central Bank, the rise will not be as drastic as that of the US dollar. There are two reasons why the US dollar tends to rise: (1) The currency value is unstable, and lending at high interest rates is unsafe. Some people buy US dollars as a way to preserve value. (2) At present, foreign goods are still being smuggled rampantly throughout the country. These transactions all require payment in cash in US dollars, so some people are buying US dollars on the market, causing the black market to rise sharply in recent days. Just look at the US goods displayed in the shops, most of which are not goods that the government allows to be imported. The Central Bank's approval of foreign exchange is very strict. Chinese and foreign merchants collude in smuggling, and US dollars are used as payment tools. Since demand is large and supply is limited, a price increase is inevitable. Also, the market price of stocks rose briefly yesterday morning because Premier Song announced support for domestic production enterprises, which boosted morale. However, due to the overall outlook, it is still not optimistic, and the price fell back in the afternoon. Observers believe that the government's support will not take effect in the short term; therefore, the future changes in the stock market price will be less affected by the implementation of the import permit system in the short term and more affected by changes in the current situation. As for the selling price of US goods on the market, as of noon yesterday, no fluctuations had been seen.</p>
<h3>Reducing Unnecessary Imports and Protecting Local Industry and Commerce: Rationally Distributing Imported Goods According to Their Urgency</h3>
<p>Zhang Fuyun Explains the Main Points of the New Measures</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the reporter visited Zhang Fuyun, Director of the Customs Administration, to inquire about his thoughts and opinions on the revised Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade. He replied that, standing in the position of a government official, he could not make any criticisms or have any opinions. However, the various points inquired by the reporter can be summarized and explained as follows: (1) The government's motive for adopting the import permit system is definitely not to restrict the normal needs of the people. For example, cotton is a necessity for the people, so it should be allowed to be imported. The government's intention is only to rationally allocate the types and quantities of imported goods. At the same time, our country's international balance of payments is too unbalanced. After the implementation of this measure, unnecessary imports can be reduced, so that our country's import and export value can gradually tend to balance. (2) Raising the import tax rate is still in the planning and research stage. This is completely separate from the implementation of the import permit system, and the two can complement each other. (3) The allocation of quotas for various commodities in the future is the most important task at present. The Provisional Import Management Committee is currently discussing it in detail. The principle is to make appropriate allocations according to the needs of the people. I am not at liberty to discuss this point in detail. (4) Smuggling work will be strengthened in the future. The situation of smuggling in this city has been reduced. However, the situation in southern China is very serious. We will strengthen crackdowns in the future to prevent unnecessary foreign goods from entering our country's market. (5) From my point of view, the implementation of the import permit system does not conflict with the Sino-US Treaty of Commerce. The conclusion of the treaty is entirely based on equality and mutual benefit. Under the new measures, we welcome the import of production tools from friendly countries. As for the fact that our country's delegation to the London International Trade and Employment Conference approved the US proposal, I am afraid there are reservations. The conclusion of the new measures is the exercise of our country's sovereignty, and others will surely understand. (6) The new measures are not specifically aimed at reducing imports to achieve a balance in the international balance of payments. The protection of domestic industry and commerce is already implied in the classification of commodities.</p>
<h3>Hu Boxiang's Thoughts</h3>
<p>Protecting Our Country's Production Enterprises and Preventing the Possible Dumping of Foreign Goods</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Mr. Hu Boxiang, incumbent director of the China Industrial Association and person in charge of the National Goods Manufacturers Federation, spoke in detail to reporters yesterday about his thoughts on our country's implementation of the import permit system. The main points are summarized as follows: (1) The purpose of these measures is to restrict the import of light industrial products and welcome the import of sophisticated machinery. This is beneficial to domestic manufacturers and protects our country's production enterprises. It is truly a wise measure by the government. (2) When prohibiting the import of goods that our country does not need, we must simultaneously eradicate smuggling in order to achieve practical results. Otherwise, the import is prohibited in name, but smuggling still continues, resulting in a loss of tariff revenue. (3) For commodities that are prohibited from import, the manufacture of similar commodities by foreign businesses in China should also be prohibited at the same time; for commodities that are restricted from import, the manufacture of similar commodities by foreign businesses in China should also be restricted at the same time in order to be thorough. For commodities that our country does not need, in addition to strictly implementing the import permit system, the import tax rate should also be increased. (4) When restricting the import of foreign goods, if they are raw materials and necessities for industry, a detailed investigation should be carried out first to ensure that legitimate industries and businesses can obtain an appropriate supply. It is necessary to avoid this kind of quota-limited supply of goods falling into the hands of speculators, resulting in hoarding and price gouging to seek high profits, causing legitimate industries and businesses to suffer losses. At the same time, the government should pay attention to the price of such quota-limited imports in the place of origin, as a basis for rational price limits; and investigate the previous needs of each factory, as a standard for future allocation. If the quota measures are not well implemented, they will harm domestic goods manufacturers. I hope that the government will implement all of this carefully. The above are Mr. Hu's thoughts on the new import measures from the perspective of the Industrial Association. From the perspective of the domestic goods business, Mr. Hu also believes that the current measures can prevent the possible dumping of foreign goods. Dumping has not yet been discovered, but commodities such as milk powder are flooding our country's market at low prices. In order to prevent this kind of situation, the government should establish an agency overseas to investigate the prices of exports from various countries in the Chinese market in order to prevent dumping. The reporter asked if domestic goods would rise in price due to a reduction in supply after foreign goods imports were drastically reduced. Mr. Hu believes that industries that can truly exist for a long time will not take the opportunity to seek windfall profits. For several months, the price of domestic products has not risen sharply. I believe that if usury can be cracked down on, the import permit system will not cause the price of domestic goods to rise.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export to Convene and Discuss, Submitting Concrete Opinions for Government Adoption</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The import and export industry is most sensitive to the new measures. Zhou Jingwei, deputy secretary-general of the industry association in this city, told reporters that the main purposes of the government's measures are: first, to strengthen the control of the entire trading industry; and second, to find a way out for the large quantities of surplus materials recently purchased. In the past, the control of the import and export industry was the responsibility of the Central Bank. This responsibility was too heavy and lost contact with the executive authorities. Now, with the establishment of the Temporary Management Committee, manpower is concentrated, command is unified, and control is greatly strengthened. The value of the US military surplus materials recently purchased by our country is actually 800 million US dollars, and the variety is large and the quantity is enormous. Under the new measures, the government can sell them to import and export merchants; in this way, the materials will have a sales channel, and the government can reduce imports and save foreign exchange. It is expected that after the implementation of the new measures, the government will strictly verify the merchants who legally operate import and export businesses. At the same time, in the future, it will be difficult for merchants operating import and export businesses, such as those who used to operate more than 40 kinds of goods, to continue; and the business operations of merchants will gradually become specialized. For example, those who operate imported machinery cannot suddenly switch to importing raw materials, or similar "jumping" will occur. There are more than 600 member merchants in this city who are engaged in import and export, and it is hoped that import and export merchants with special backgrounds can also join the association. Because this type of merchant has strong backing, they have openly written to foreign merchants in the past, stating that even if the Central Bank does not approve foreign exchange, they can still conduct transactions. Such remarks have greatly dissatisfied honest foreign merchants. It is expected that under the new measures, this type of import and export company will still have its special conveniences. The Import and Export Chamber of Commerce will convene a meeting in the next few days to discuss and study the new import measures in detail, and will submit concrete opinions for the government to adopt. What is currently hoped is that the government will respect the position of the Chamber of Commerce, and that the allocation of quotas in the future can be reasonably resolved through the Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Zhou believes that the classification order of imported goods is still appropriate, but the classification is not detailed enough; and he said that there will be detailed supplementary measures soon, and there will be certain handling methods for imported goods ordered before the announcement of the new measures.</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu Convenes Textile Industry to Discuss Eliminating Black Market in Cotton Yarn, Agreed on Methods to Settle Futures Contracts within a Time Limit</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Mayor Wu convened an emergency meeting at 2:30 pm yesterday (the 18th) in the City Government Auditorium to discuss ways to eliminate the black market in cotton yarn. Those attending included Shu Yunzhang, general manager of the China Textile Construction Corporation; Wang Qiyu, chairman of the Sixth District Cotton Yarn Association; Lin Baobao and Yang Xiren from the Textile Management Committee; Pan Shihao from the dyeing and weaving industry; Xu Zhaohou from the hosiery industry; Yao Siwei from the handkerchief industry; Dong Jiufeng from the cotton weaving industry; Shi Yihu from the Chongxin Yarn Factory; Rong Hongyuan from the Shenxin Yarn Factory; Guo Dihuo from the Wing On Yarn Factory; and Dong Chunfang from the Tongyi Yarn Factory. Mayor Wu presided over the meeting, first stating the government's determination to crack down on the black market in cotton yarn, hoping that all sectors would not think that the promulgated decrees were just empty words. The government is fully determined to thoroughly eliminate the black market. He continued, "The reason I am convening this emergency meeting today is because I received a telegram from President Song yesterday from Nanjing, instructing me to inform yarn merchants that strengthening the control of imported goods will benefit domestic yarn merchants. He also stated that there is absolutely no problem with the source of cotton, so cotton yarn can be produced as much as possible, and there is no reason for the existence of a black market." Mayor Wu also personally inspected the cotton yarn markets yesterday afternoon. As a result, it was found that the Xiehe Yarn Store on Jiangxi Road had a major wrongdoing. The store bought 290 pieces of yarn on October 25, but the whereabouts of 80 pieces are unknown. A thorough investigation is underway. In addition, after yesterday afternoon's investigation, there was a great deal of information gained regarding the factors that create the current black market, and a large amount of evidence has been collected. From the government's perspective, it should have been severely punished, but in order to give everyone a chance to completely change their thinking, leniency is being shown, and it is hoped that everyone will think more about the public good. When Mayor Wu spoke, his tone was firm and his words were very serious. He concluded by saying: "All of you sitting here today are representatives of the cotton yarn industry and yarn factories. Please explain why black market prices still exist, and discuss ways to crack down on them together."</p>
<p>Reasons for the Occurrence of the Black Market</p>
<p>Wang Qiyu, chairman of the Sixth District Cotton Yarn Association, expressed his opinion: "The statement that the monthly production of cotton yarn is 65,000 pieces is incorrect. The current production of cotton yarn in this city can only spare 400 pieces per day. Calculated at 24 days per month, the monthly surplus is 12,000 pieces. The only hope for private factories now is to do their best to add new spindles and new equipment. Regarding the factors of the black market, Mr. Wang believes that the price of 12-pound fine cloth has risen, and each bolt of cloth can earn 20,000 yuan, so merchants want to buy more yarn. In the case of supply not meeting demand, the black market arises."</p>
<p>Tang Xinghai, a director of the Sixth District Cotton Yarn Association, said: "There are two reasons for the black market: (1) The knitting industry needs 20-count yarn, but it is allocated 32-count yarn, so it must sell this and buy that. (2) Different manufacturers need different types of yarn. For example, those who are accustomed to using '云牌' will refuse to use '双马牌', and in the process of buying and selling, the black market is created."</p>
<p>Mr. Ye from the knitting industry said: "The first step for the six knitting associations is to stop buying at black market prices, but because the amount of allocated yarn is insufficient, it is impossible to prohibit buying in. Therefore, he advocated that if the amount of yarn cannot be increased, he is willing to reduce work, but he hopes that the city government will find a way to mediate with the workers. He also advocated that the allocation price of cotton yarn can be appropriately increased."</p>
<p>Content of the Textile Construction Corporation</p>
<p>Finally, Shu Yunzhang of the Textile Construction Corporation reported on the true content of the company, saying that most of the company's cotton yarn production this year must be supplied for the production of military uniforms, and a considerable amount must also be reserved in May next year, so the Textile Construction Corporation has already made its greatest efforts, and it is currently difficult to talk about increasing production. Regarding yarn allocation, he hoped that it could reach 80% to 90% of the demand. For the knitting industry, he could provide a detailed list of needs, and said that this is a time when "mutual concession is for the country," and he hoped that everyone would not be discouraged. Furthermore, in the current situation where supply cannot meet demand, he hoped that manufacturers would not engage in futures trading.</p>
<p>Finally, Mayor Wu made a concluding statement: (1) Regarding the electricity saving issue, he has discussed it with the Municipal Public Works Bureau and will soon launch senior city government officials to earnestly persuade all streets and shops. Mayor Wu has also decided to take action himself and lead by example. He guaranteed that the electricity saving issue will definitely be thoroughly implemented in order to increase production. (2) Regarding the cotton issue, if manufacturers want to go to other ports, such as Hankou and Zhengzhou, to purchase cotton, and lack funds, he guaranteed that the Central Bank will definitely find a way to provide loans. Finally, Mayor Wu believed that it was extremely unreasonable for manufacturers to engage in futures trading without bearing interest.

Otherwise, the holder of the order is allowed to report to the city government. (2) From now on, when each manufacturer engages in futures trading, interest must be deducted first. (3) From today on, all cotton yarn transactions must be completed in the market of the Cotton Yarn Industry Association. If yarn is sold outside the market, it will be regarded as illegal and will be severely punished according to law. . Yarn factories that voluntarily export must undergo detailed registration and must have a corresponding time limit. If the goods are not shipped out by the deadline, they will all be regarded as hoarding.</p>

<h3>Textbook Supply Issues - Ministry of Education to Hold Meeting Today - Representatives from Seven-Organization Joint Office Summoned to Beijing</h3>

Otherwise, if they are crudely manufactured and anyone is allowed to print them, then hundreds and thousands of versions may appear at the same time. In the future, in terms of the text, it will be impossible to correct mutual errors, and in case there is something "fake" messing with the "real" in terms of content, it will not be easy to detect or prohibit for a while.</p>

<h3>"Local Emperor" of Southern Henan Imprisoned</h3>
<p>— Wang Shoumei, Our Kaifeng Correspondent</p>
<p>13th Dispatch</p>
<p>Gu Ying, the "King of Shangcheng," renowned in southern Henan, has been dismissed and detained by the Henan Provincial Government. It is as if a fierce tiger has been caught in a cage.</p>
<p>Shangcheng has been shrouded in the terror of death for eight years, having long lost its light and justice, with no principles or laws. It has become another world, and the master of this world is Gu Ying, the creator of terror.</p>
<p>Regarding the emergence of the "local emperor" Gu Ying, people in Shangcheng say, "Gu Ying only had three benefactors in his 'achievements': one was a warlord, one was the Communist Party, and the other was the Japanese invaders." That is to say, the warlords, the Communist Party, and the Japanese invaders created a special environment for him, enabling him to become the "King of Shangcheng" after conquering Shangcheng with terror.</p>
<p>Military and Political Power Concentrated in One Person</p>
<p>Gu Ying has a simple mind, lacks common sense, and is a complete "country bumpkin." He has not studied any military or political theories, nor has he read official documents. His dictionary only contains the word "kill." He started with the Red Spear Society. Long before the War of Resistance, under the protection and support of a certain warlord, he organized the Red Spear Society in the Xinsheng Township area of Shangcheng, gathering local armed forces and uniting bandits and hoodlums. The warlord wanted to use him to expand his own power, while Gu Ying wanted to use this opportunity to lay the foundation for conquering Shangcheng by force. Before long, he possessed considerable military strength.</p>
<p>In the early days of the War of Resistance, due to our military setbacks, the enemy, after occupying Nanjing and Shanghai, advanced westward along the Yangtze River, and the situation in Wuhan became critical. In order to arrange the defense of Greater Wuhan, Deputy Chief of Staff Bai particularly paid attention to Shangcheng, the gateway to the Dabie Mountains, because if Shangcheng fell, the enemy could cross the Dabie Mountains and directly threaten Wuhan. Because Shangcheng occupied an important strategic position, the local armed forces in Shangcheng were also valued. At that time, Gu Ying, who possessed strong military power in Shangcheng, had an ambiguous attitude. Bai believed that this force, no matter what, must be used in the righteous path of self-defense and national defense. Otherwise, this force would either surrender to the enemy or become traitors. Therefore, Gu Ying was appointed as the Commander of Assaults and concurrently the Magistrate of Shangcheng County, concentrating military and political power in one person. This gave him a great opportunity to display his "ambitions."</p>
<p>After he grasped the political and military power of Shangcheng, he immediately adopted two approaches: one was to create terror through massacres in order to achieve the goal of conquest and rule; the other was to strengthen the special nature of Shangcheng, creating a psychology of accommodation to the environment at the higher levels, thereby consolidating his military and political position. His approach was successful. His military and political position in Shangcheng was maintained under this approach until he was detained. The provincial authorities only understood the true situation in Shangcheng very recently.</p>
<p>Parents Host a Banquet to Apologize After Their Son is Killed by Magistrate Gu</p>
<p>Under his terrible approach, what crimes did he commit? The 300,000 people of Shangcheng can tell everyone:</p>
<p>He loved to kill, using killing to establish his authority and eliminate dissidents. He would kill anyone he had a grudge against, and he would kill anyone who disobeyed him. Over the past seven or eight years, among the well-known upright gentlemen killed under his butcher's knife were Hong Xiangqing, Mei Youxiang, Hu Xiange, and others. As for the rest, some had their entire families buried alive by him, and some were assassinated by him in secret. The numbers are simply countless. In November of the 32nd year of the Republic, a student disturbance occurred at the Shangcheng branch of the Henan Provincial Xinyang Normal School due to a minor matter. Gu Ying, in his capacity as county magistrate, went to maintain order at the school. After arriving at the school, during the weekly memorial service, he hinted to his henchmen to shoot and kill Bao Qifu, a good student at the school, on the spot, causing an uproar among the faculty and students. Three days after this incident occurred, this reporter happened to arrive in the county on official business and was shocked to hear about it. However, no one dared to express an opinion on this case. This reporter repeatedly asked them about it, but no one dared to say a word. Even more strangely, the parents of the deceased hosted a banquet in the city to invite Magistrate Gu to dinner, formally apologizing to Magistrate Gu at the banquet: "Our child deserved to die. Please don't be angry, Magistrate, and don't hold it against us..." The ferocity of Gu Ying and the pitiful misery of the people under his conquest can be seen from this.</p>
<p>I remember that when this reporter met with the "local emperor" that time, he told me frankly and proudly, "The affairs of Shangcheng are easy to handle. When my orders go down, they are carried out to the letter. Everyone knows my temper. If they don't obey me, I won't be polite. For example, when I prohibit gambling, I just put up a sign with four words: 'Gambling is prohibited.' Then, if anyone is found gambling within the borders of Shangcheng, my plainclothes team will simply throw a bomb at them, sending them all back to their hometowns." (As he said this, he opened his mouth wide, emitting a proud and terrifying laugh, like a tiger roaring in an empty valley, making one's hair stand on end.) "Also, when dealing with prostitutes, I remember one morning, I suddenly thought that prostitutes were not allowed. I immediately issued an order limiting the prostitutes to leave the country that day. If prostitutes were found within the borders of Shangcheng County by nightfall, they would be buried alive. Can't prostitutes run away? Humph, that's because it's not time yet. I remember that day, as soon as the order came down, they rushed to get on the road so desperately that they didn't even care about their luggage. By nightfall, not one of them had failed to run beyond the county's borders, which were 120 miles away."</p>
<p>Words of a Murderous Demon</p>
<p>"Even a three-year-old child must be killed, lest he kill me in the future?"</p>
<p>He had many types of punishment, and they were very cruel. Regardless of whether it was a criminal or civil case, regardless of the severity of the case, he would make them experience his power. It is said that in the western countryside of the county, a certain family had a dispute with someone over land. Somehow, it aroused his anger, and he buried the entire family alive. In the end, only a three-year-old child was left. His guards, seeing the situation, felt it was too tragic and couldn't bear to bury him anymore. Gu Ying was furious and said, "We must uproot the weeds to prevent future trouble. Will this little beast kill me in the future?" So he did it himself, dug a pit, and buried the child as well. In Shangcheng, it was illegal to smoke or sell cigarettes. A certain Zhou was executed by Gu Ying using electric shocks for selling cigarettes.</p>
<p>Words of Grief and Anger from the Common People</p>
<p>"My work will not stop until the Commander is dead"</p>
<p>Gu Ying was healthy and strong. He had three concubines. All three of these concubines were snatched from other people. They lived in the Cai Tangzi, Sifangwa, and Shenjiafan areas of Xinsheng Township. He knew how to enjoy himself. He knew how to keep his mistresses in a golden house. He conscripted labor and materials to build magnificent and luxurious residences in these three places, totaling more than a thousand grand rooms. It is said that the walls of the grand rooms were built with beautiful flower stone bars, and the thickness of the walls reached three meters, said to be impenetrable by mortars. In order to build the houses, it was necessary to have flower stone bars, so a ten-mile-long road was opened up in the steep cliffs. The conscripted people dared not say they were unwilling and were still honestly working for Gu Ying. But there was also a saying there: "My work will not stop until the Commander is dead." Everyone remembered this saying in their hearts, but no one dared to say it out loud. After many years as commander and county magistrate, he had become an astonishingly wealthy man. He now owned 18,000 mu of fertile land. His wealth, of course, came from extortionate taxes and levies. In addition to paying regular grain taxes every year, the people of Shangcheng were also charged an additional four to seven dou per stone (each dou being thirty catties) by Gu Ying in the name of running education, called "Jidao Zhuang." In the spring, they were charged an additional two to three dou of wheat per stone. Apart from the one or two percent used for running schools, no one dared to question the rest. For years, there were natural disasters and poor harvests, and the people grew thinner day by day, while Gu Ying grew fatter day by day!</p>
<p>Routine official documents from the higher authorities were never valued in his place. His county government secretary used his red inkpad seal every day to stamp those routine official matters "depending on the circumstances." Subordinates who saw these official documents also put them on the shelf, and even if it was a big deal, it was considered done. He had another pattern of blue inkpad seal for his own use. If he issued an order, he would use this seal. Subordinates, upon seeing the handwritten order with the blue seal, would carry out the order without fail, day and night. A slight negligence would lead to unimaginable consequences.</p>
<p>His stubborn attitude was rarely seen. I remember that when he spoke with this reporter that time, he said, "I (Shangcheng dialect, meaning 'I') have not read the Three Principles of the People, and I don't care about the Three Principles of the People. I just do it this way, and I don't care if people criticize me or not. I have my own ideas." How many such stubborn people can be found among the current administrative personnel?</p>
<p>At the last provincial administrative conference, many people thought that he would not attend the province, and many people also hoped to catch a glimpse of this murderous demon. Who knew that he would bring three sacks of banknotes with him? After arriving in Kaifeng, he tried his best to send those banknotes to the important people who could help him, because he knew that the roars of those conquered slaves in Shangcheng had already shaken Kaifeng.</p>
<p>The Henan Provincial Government authorities remained silent on this case at the time. This silence caused unease among the people of Shangcheng and also attracted the attention of the media. The newspapers here all published the crimes of this "local emperor" in prominent positions.</p>
<p>Chairman Liu, who was calm and decisive, was after all determined to purify the bureaucracy. As soon as the administrative conference closed, he issued a silent order to dismiss Gu Ying and instructed the provincial police bureau to detain Gu Ying.</p>
<p>When this news spread, people were overjoyed and it caused a sensation. Especially the people of Shangcheng were so excited that they almost jumped up.</p>
<p>Now, Gu Ying has been detained for quite some time and has long been transferred from the provincial police bureau to the court for trial. However, a trace of doubt seems to have been added to the excited faces of the people of Shangcheng, because the court has been slow to pronounce a verdict. They fear that the court will sentence this murderous demon Gu Ying to a term of three or two years. Once Gu Ying posts bail, he will be like a tiger released from its cage, and letting the tiger return to the mountain would be unthinkable for the people of Shangcheng. They are not being overly concerned. Social figures here are also sweating for the people of Shangcheng on this issue.</p>
<p>The Henan-Shandong Supervisory Envoy's Office had submitted an impeachment document on the Gu Ying case a few days ago. Social figures who read the impeachment document were filled with righteous indignation, and everyone advocated quickly stabbing this tiger to death. However, the Kaifeng District Court, which is handling the case, has its own procedures. It cannot, as people generally imagine, simply execute Gu Ying immediately before all the evidence has been fully obtained.</p>
<p>Today, the Henan Minbao and China Times here published such a message: "Central News Agency Dispatch: After Gu Ying, the former magistrate of Shangcheng County, was reported by people in the county, the Henan-Shandong Supervisory Envoy's Office sent personnel to Shangcheng for more than a month and uncovered dozens of cases of corruption and illegal activities, all of which were confirmed, and impeachment was filed, causing social outrage. It is heard that the provincial government also sent officials to Shangcheng to investigate at the same time and collected more ironclad evidence. The investigation report was more than 50,000 to 60,000 words, all with opinions signed by the relevant authorities, and the case files have been transferred to the Kaifeng District Court for concurrent prosecution. Among them, such items as treating human life like grass, corruption figures, stealing national defense equipment, and intercepting the 39th Army are even more lawless and shocking. Moreover, most of the items investigated were not disclosed by the informants in the county. It is now heard that the informants in the county have requested the Kaifeng District Court to supplement the prosecution in accordance with the law based on the facts."</p>
<p>After this message was published, people in society stretched their necks, hoping for the arrival of the doomsday of this chaotic demon, and even those wronged souls under Gu Ying's butcher's knife were waiting for news day and night in front of the Kaifeng District Court!</p>

<h3>A Look at Xinjiang</h3>
<p>— Special Translation by Our Editorial Office</p>
<p>Ensuring the Gateway to the Western Border</p>
<p>After the reporter drove a Jeep on a pilgrimage for several days along the ancient desert caravan routes south of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang, he can naturally make a just and positive account of the current political and economic situation of this medieval Islamic civilization. This economic system formed a small oasis in the vast and boundless desert. Since Sheng Shicai usurped power in the new province in 1933, it has been virtually isolated from the modern world. Now, under the rule of the new provincial chairman, General Zhang Zhizhong, Xinjiang has embarked on the road to revival.</p>
<p>On August 26, 1945, at the height of the Ili rebellion, an army composed of Muslims, Uyghurs, Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Kyrgyz people captured B犁 (a fortress in southern Xinjiang Province and a gateway to Afghanistan, the Soviet Union, and India). The city was occupied by 13,000 rebels and was returned to the Chinese army on July 1, in accordance with the treaty signed in Dihua on June 6. Subsequently, large numbers of National Army troops flowed into southern Xinjiang, stationing heavy forces in the important cities of Turpan, Kuche, Aksu, Shule, Puli, and Shache.</p>
<p>According to unofficial Chinese sources, the Soviet Union is conducting vivid anti-Chinese propaganda among the local people of Xinjiang. This propaganda is enhanced by the influx of Russian goods into the local markets. This is possible, but it must be understood that the Islamic nations of the neighboring Soviet republics are of the same bloodline as the Muslims of Xinjiang, and political boundaries are not very important to them. The reporter spent half a month with the leaders of the Muslims in Xinjiang and was unable to detect the slightest communist tendency among these frontier peoples. On the contrary, they expressed disgust with the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p>According to the Uyghurs, nearly 100,000 National Army troops are stationed in southern Xinjiang Province, and the number is still increasing. The Xinjiang authorities are unwilling to disclose the actual number of troops stationed there. A few months ago, the people regained confidence in the National Government due to Chairman Zhang's virtuous policies of abolishing taxes and releasing political prisoners. Now, that confidence has begun to waver with the large increase in the number of National Army troops. Local leaders have issued appeals, saying that a large army is not needed to maintain local security or defend against foreign invasion. These troops consume huge amounts of food and only increase the local economic burden. It is said that the Muslims have petitioned Chairman Zhang to divert the huge military expenditure to develop irrigation and highways in order to promote the sale of grains, fruits, carpets, leather, and furs. The Turkic Uyghurs account for at least 75 percent of the four million people in the new province. In addition to the 150,000 "outsider" Chinese, such as administrative officials, shopkeepers, and technicians in the major cities, the rest are Muslims. These Muslims have always been united in terms of ethnicity and religion, and they have become even stronger recently due to the Ili rebellion. Workers in the new province are now holding elections for representatives to the provincial and county councils in accordance with the provisions of the Dihua Treaty.</p>
<p>Muslim rebels now completely control the most prosperous area in the northwest of Xinjiang Province, while the National Government controls the vast territory in the south, which is full of fertile land. The residents there also enjoy autonomy, but they lack water, roads, and clothing.</p>
<p>If the National Government can provide Zhang Zhizhong with the necessary support and the Ili rebel government can allow him to obtain oil, coal, and other resources west of the Manas River, then Zhang will be able to correct the shameful situation created by Sheng Shicai's tyranny. If Zhang can meet the simplest needs of the desert herders and the farmers in the fertile land and relieve them of the heavy burden of supplying large troops, then the disturbances that have occurred in southern Xinjiang can be quelled immediately.</p>
<p>The loess soil of southern Xinjiang's fertile land produces wheat, sugarcane, millet, melons, corn, grapes, and apples. Tens of thousands of cattle, sheep, and horses graze on the grasslands at the foot of the mountains.</p>
<p>Building a modern highway across Xinjiang Province can make the poor new province prosperous and at the same time ensure China's gateway to the western border.</p>

<h3>Sunday Forum Public Health is a Kind of War</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shang</p>
<p>Written After the National Public Health Administration Conference</p>
<p>The War of Resistance is a great reformer. Individual interests are subordinate to public needs. In the process of resisting the war, when striving for victory, our men and women sacrifice for the public benefit. The War of Resistance is over, and the simple goal of victory has disappeared. New purposes and new goals must be found. Here is a goal that must undoubtedly be chosen, and that goal is health. Fight for health, unite people from all regions to fight together for health. This affects the life of each of us and the happiness of the whole. Everyone should participate in a part of this war.</p>
<p>Public health is a science, an art, and also a kind of war. All countries in the world should participate in this war and become the United Nations. Its enemies are sometimes a bacterium or a filterable virus, sometimes a flea, sometimes a fly or a mosquito, a dog or a rat. Sometimes it is an inanimate chemical substance. Sometimes it is a product of human brains and hands. Sometimes, however, it is ourselves.</p>
<p>The war of public health is not only in hospitals and laboratories, not only by the bedside of patients. Its battlefield is in the Senate, in the Executive Yuan, in factories, in mines, in fields of raw food, in shops of bagged food, in kitchens, in laundries, in schools, in families. When the sewers are broken, the garbage is piled up, and the enemies in the dirt appear, the war begins. There are too many enemies of hygiene to guard against, so we must always be vigilant and prepared for small skirmishes.</p>
<p>The strategic objective of this war is simple and clear, but there are many possible battle routes. Currently, China is fighting this war, and there seem to be the following emergency response routes: (1) Dirtiness, (2) Ignorance, (3) Poverty</p>
<p>The first front is a frontal war with dirtiness as the position:</p>
<p>The most problematic aspect of hygiene in our country is dirtiness. Dirtiness wastes human lives, dirtiness weakens national strength, dirtiness damages morality, and dirtiness lowers national dignity. We live in uncleanness every day, urinating and spitting everywhere. Dead cats, dead rats, food scraps, garbage, poultry and fish bones, vegetable and fruit peels, are all destined for the streets. Inland cities are like mud bodhisattvas squatting one by one, lined with large, small, broken, and good dung tanks. On one side, rice is washed and vegetables are washed, and on the other side, chamber pots are washed and night soil is poured. Horses, cattle, sheep, chickens, dogs, and pigs live and sleep together with people. Left over from the barbaric era, the streets, "one street of mud when it rains, three feet of dust when there is no wind," are filled with pigs and people racing ahead of each other. In major international cities, the intersection of sewers collapses many houses, and the heart of the city is allowed to have sewage flowing for a long time, and the stench fills the sky. The surroundings are covered with garbage dumps and dead things, allowing bacteria to freely breed and spread. In May, the garbage in Shanghai accumulated to 12,000 tons. How can it not make the millions of citizens who live and work there shudder?</p>
<p>On the personal side, mange, sore eyes, impetigo, scabies, etc., are prevalent in large and small societies throughout the year. Lice, head lice, fleas, bedbugs, mosquitoes, and flies are too numerous to count. Golden teeth, a full face of beard, long hair, a black neck, greasy clothes, digging nostrils in front of people, scratching thighs, and then sending snot to the door. Lice disturb the body all day long, and when caught, they are leisurely sent to the mouth, and the lips and teeth are constantly buzzing. Dr. Rocloff personally saw his successor catch eighty-nine in one minute.</p>
<p>Now we urgently need to universally establish a tap water system. Japanese-style public baths, hold cleaning campaigns, brushing campaigns, and at the same time build ditches in the countryside. Professor L. Bonmer said, "The benefit of a ditch to the countryside can be compared to the country's opening of the Panama or Suez Canal." Sanitary engineering is indeed the main infantry of this rare war. However, those who are familiar with sanitary engineering in our country are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. The proposal to set up sanitary engineering scholarships at this sanitary administration conference is worth promoting.</p>
<p>The second is to fight ignorance with a left-wing flanking attack. Ignorance is stupidity, and stupidity is most likely to ruin things. Half of all kinds of bad things are knowingly committed by intelligent and clever people, and half are unintentionally caused by ignorant and stupid people. Bad things in hygiene are brewed by ignorance. Superstition is the deadly enemy of health, and superstition comes from stupidity. Because our education is backward and hygienic knowledge is not popularized, we are still in this primitive era, and we still regard illness as abuse by demons, and seek gods and ask for divination. We have not yet passed the Stone Age of 12,000 years before the Christian era, and we do not know how many lives, large and small, have been harmed. It endangers the biological foundation of the nation and shakes the foundation for building the country. We should use the army of hygienic education to fight. After the victory, the first National Sanitary Administration Conference decided to strengthen hygienic propaganda and set up scientific, technical and hygienic education propaganda agencies in the health care business group. This is the vanguard of hygiene, an indispensable method for enlightening the people's wisdom.</p>
<p>Professor Wilson G. Smillie of Public Health at Harvard University emphasized the importance of educational policy in controlling malaria. He said: "The malaria control program cannot be successful unless the people fully understand the principles of transmission and prevention of this disease." Before implementing school hygienic education and public hygienic education, doctors and nurses should first understand hygienic education. This is not a matter of knowledge, but a matter of attitude. Today we have 30,289 medical personnel, including 13,40 physicians and 5,997 nurses. We hope that they will unite with teachers across the country to be hygienic ambassadors and hygienic teachers. We must educate children and unborn mothers. We must educate her during childbirth. After childbirth, we must educate both mothers and children. We must educate children from infancy to school, educate during school, educate out of school and into the workplace, and then re-educate them from time to time in adulthood. Remember, we don't have enough doctors and nurses to treat diseases, let them be healthy.</p>
<p>This homework is simple. Clean fresh air, good food, hard work, adequate rest, holidays, reasonable and not superstitious, scientific and not fatalistic, we must find out what people know, how they learn, how ignorant they are, we must educate them in schools, in families, on radio stations, films, slogans, newspapers.</p>
<p>The third right-wing battlefield is opened in terms of poverty: poverty is the great enemy of health. The causes of poverty are disease, unemployment, old age, and large families. These problems are all mutually causal with poverty. Other people's bodies are strong and their spirits are sufficient to produce everything better than us, and we will unilaterally dump other people's things. After our victory, we hear that export trade failed and caused unemployment; the transfer of business due to unemployment is a bad phenomenon of domestic political planning and organization. Because we are unhealthy, we are prone to aging and old age. Not only can we not produce, but we must also sell. The difference between one in and one out is naturally great. In large families, there are many tired, disabled, few born, and many who eat. How can we not be poor?</p>
<p>The poor cannot get her medical treatment and recuperation when they are sick, and countless people die unjustly when they should not. The poor usually live in crowded houses, where the land is narrow and the people are crowded, diseases breed, and they eat one scoop of water and one basket of rice. How can they not starve to death? After the victory, the housing shortage is terrible, and prices are jumping like wild horses. Excellent nationals are inevitably drowned in the torrents of reverse elimination and reverse selection.</p>
<p>People should have adequate housing at reasonable rents, and the country should have good plans to treat the symptoms and root causes, and it is even more necessary to eliminate slums. As for food, everyone should have adequate quality and quantity, especially pregnant women, nursing mothers, children under five, and school children need first-class nutrients. This means giving them sufficient vitamins, high-grade proteins, and minerals. This is not a waste, but a need. We are so poor that we cannot give it away for free. At least we must supply it at a low price. This requires controlling food prices and supplementing food production when necessary. This is the national food plan, controlling the market and distribution, so that money must be the servant of people, and absolutely, absolutely not let money be the master.</p>
<p>Our country's public health itself is already anemic and has no money to nourish it. From 1940 to this year, the total national annual budget (in thousands of yuan) was 2,915,621,560, and the sanitary expenditure was 3,668,845, accounting for 0.126, that is, only 126 yuan out of 1,000 yuan spent by the country was spent on sanitation. Let's see how the situation in the two countries of England and India is:</p>
<p>England 1934-1935 India 1931-1932</p>
<p>National population 46,680,000 271,580,000</p>
<p>National income</p>
<p>Pounds 3,700,000,000 Rupees 16,890,000,000</p>
<p>National currency 59,200,000,000 National currency 21,112,500,000</p>
<p>Medical expenses</p>
<p>Pounds 75,000,000 Rupees 40,800,000</p>
<p>National currency 1,200,000,000 National currency 510,000,000</p>
<p>Medical expenses as a percentage of total government expenditure 7.97 1.85</p>
<p>Public health expenditure</p>
<p>Pounds 27,000,000 Rupees 17,400,000</p>
<p>National currency 1,872,000,000 National currency 20,750,000</p>
<p>Public health expenditure as a percentage of total government expenditure 12.430 0.79</p>
<p>We cannot help but feel ashamed when we compare ourselves with them. We are far behind England, and even India is inferior. There is a Western saying, "Public Health is. Purchasable." With such public health today, if we compare the amount of money with the results, it is already a great success. In the past, in the era of "I am the country," the national budget was based on income and expenditure. In today's democratic era, it should be based on expenditure and income. The former means doing as much as possible with as much money as possible, while the latter means taking as much money as possible to do as much as possible. Public health is a matter of life and death, and the poor people will definitely take out this money.</p>
<p>This war is not only the responsibility of hygienists and doctors, but it is our responsibility. We know the purpose, we have a strategy, as long as we unite our will with all our strength, we can win the war. (Capital, 8 November 1946)</p>

<h3>Mother Education</h3>
<p>— Jin Xieshan</p>
<p>...To know the children of twenty years from now, just look at the mothers of today!</p>
<p>It is not difficult for us to find in history that some great figures have been greatly influenced by their mothers, and thus can promote society and add glory to the country and nation; but at the same time, we can also see that some unfilial sons are not without a major relationship with mother education.</p>
<p>The ancient books say: "Raising without teaching is the father's fault, and teaching without strictness is the teacher's laziness." It seems that the creation of all the child's bad behaviors has nothing to do with the mother. Teaching should be done by the father, but may I ask how much time a father can spend educating his children under the current social system? My intention is not to shirk the responsibility of all fathers, but to explain that fathers may have too little time to educate their children—and mothers can almost be said to be with their children all day long. Even a mother of a school-age child probably has more time to contact her child than her father. Moreover, the mother's warmth and kindness and the father's sternness, and who the child likes to be close to, are also natural results. (Closeness is the opportunity to naturally instill education.) We cannot arbitrarily say that warmth and kindness are not enough to educate children, then the importance of the mother's responsibility for raising children can also be seen here.</p>
<p>Since the responsibility of women is so important, let's open our eyes and look at the crowd who are now respecting their mothers!</p>
<p>Without any statistics, we can know that the majority of our country's women are still trapped in the misery of illiteracy. They lack knowledge and have no fresh minds; the upper classes while away their years playing cards, and the lower classes increase the excitement of life by gossiping. We can still find village women cursing in the streets in several alleys in Shanghai. Ignorance, stupidity, and all unwise actions still exist in too many families. In a temple on Nanjing Road, the most bustling street in Shanghai, the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month are still chaotic and lively. Although some people say that most of them are "businesswomen," there are still many housewives among them. Isn't this enough to show the sadness of the future of Chinese women's education?</p>
<p>The sadness of the future of women's education is also the sadness of children. Mr. Lu Xun once said: "To know the country twenty years from now, just look at the children of today." But we might as well say: "To know the children of twenty years from now, just look at the mothers of today!"</p>
<p>The amount of time mothers spend with their children has already been said above. Children are rich in imitation. The child spends more time with the mother. Undoubtedly, the influence of the mother must also be the greatest. But many mothers are in a pitiful state of no education, how can we not be sad for our children and sad for our country?</p>
<p>The need for women's education is self-evident, and this call has already been shouted. However, in view of the lack of standard mothers and the lack of great success in women's education, what we need to shout urgently now is that all women need re-education—the education of mothers; how to be a standard mother can indeed be listed as a specialized subject! If the government can run a mother's specialty school, it is not a superfluous move to create something new compared to a bride school.</p>

<h3>Old Maid</h3>
<p>— Translated by Yu Jing from the Mainland News, original by Dorothy Dix</p>
<p>Although women have achieved a state of liberation, they still cannot escape a major shackle, that is, they must get married. A woman without a husband is the symbol of her failure as a woman. Of course, in the past, marriage was the only noble profession for women. Husbands and lipsticks were as necessary as husbands. Husbands were not only meal tickets, but also admission tickets to social occasions. A woman without a husband is unfortunate and is abandoned in the darkness outside the door of luck, where there is a group of crying, angry "leftovers."</p>
<p>But today everything is gradually changing. The door of opportunity is equally open to men and women. They can choose any profession they like, and the ability to earn money individually is only limited by their ability to do things. Happy unmarried women are the most welcome guests, but the average old maid, even if she is wearing rings on her hands and gold chains on her feet, will still be ashamed that she does not have a wedding ring on her hand.</p>
<p>If every marriage certificate is a certificate of happiness, you can naturally understand why women pursue it; if a woman is madly in love with a man, you can also understand why she pursues him until she gets him. But millions of women get married every year, and none of the above reasons make them shoulder the heavy responsibility of marriage.</p>
<p>They are not victims of great passion, they are not like poets who say: "Without love, the world is over." They cannot find the heroes of their girlhood dreams in vulgar youths. Often he does not meet some of their requirements for a husband, but they would rather marry the only man they have seen than endure the shame of having the word "Miss" engraved on their tombstones.</p>
<p>Working women marry not because of the illusion that they can sit back and enjoy themselves after getting a husband. She can remember that the female colleague at the writing desk next door used to buy clothes in French fashion stores, but now that she is married, she can only buy in lower-class stores. She also often has to help her sister pay the rent and buy shoes for her children.</p>
<p>The price of wedding batches is extremely high, and women continue to woo them. Even if they are not madly in love, they still get married, perhaps without even knowing why. Not a day goes by that I don't receive letters from women asking how and where to find a husband, or how to choose one from two or three men, and the author really has no bias towards any of them.</p>
<p>Many women do not marry for love, nor do they hope to live comfortably after marriage, but they are so determined to get married, which is incomprehensible to anyone. My opinion is that they are still victims of traditional shackles and would rather be called a wife than an old maid.</p>
<h3>Nanny</h3>
<p>— Yan Ying</p>
<p>In the extravagant Shanghai, wealthy wives are infatuated with the enjoyment of material things. In order to avoid the trouble of breastfeeding, they mostly hire nannies to do it for them. The mothers never think about whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. In addition, due to the vanity of the mothers, hiring nannies has become a symbol of wealthy families.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are general working women, for their own careers. They have no choice but to hand over the responsibility of breastfeeding to the nanny. Their motives may not be impure, but in the balance of gains and losses, and considering the spiritual cultivation of their children, I am afraid that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages.</p>
<p>Maternal love is great. Mothers should give spiritual nourishment in the process of nurturing and educating their children, and build the path of cultivation in their children's small minds. However, with the employment of nannies, the infusion of maternal love loses many opportunities, and the nannies often give the young masters an undue indulgence, thus forming an objective environment of doting or indulgence. In addition, most nannies come from poor families. Due to the limitations of work and hygiene, they rarely have sound bodies. More dangerously, they may have latent infectious diseases, and the brain of Yulu may also affect the children. We can often see many shrewd parents, but their children become very rough, and this is often the reason.</p>
<p>In short, from all aspects, hiring a nanny is the most worthless thing. For the happiness of the family and the future of the children, we should abandon the bad habit of hiring nannies unless it is unavoidable due to our own illness, etc.</p>
<h3>Identification of Wool Yarn</h3>
<p>— Fei Wen</p>
<p>Must compare and research when purchasing</p>
<p>Wool yarn has become a clothing necessity for every family, because its advantages are softness, warmth, and lightness. After wearing it, it can be disassembled, washed, and remade.</p>
<p>Here are a few ways to identify the quality of wool yarn that can be used when purchasing wool yarn:</p>
<p>(1) Softness test: We pick up the wool yarn and put it on the nose or cheek. Good quality wool yarn will produce a warm and soft feeling, while poor quality wool yarn will have a stiff feeling.</p>
<p>(2) Tensile test: We pull apart a twist of wool yarn and pull it hard. Good quality wool yarn can be pulled longer and very naturally.</p>
<p>(3) Elasticity test. Elasticity is a necessary condition for wool yarn, because without elasticity, the wool yarn shirt that is knitted will not be soft at all. To test the elasticity, you can take out a thread and stretch it with both hands. Good quality wool yarn has great elasticity, while poor quality wool yarn has little elasticity.</p>
<p>Recently, so-called Australian wool yarn has been discovered on the market, but it is actually manufactured by informal wool yarn factories in Shanghai, and it is nothing more than a fake trademark. You must know this when purchasing wool yarn.</p>
<h3>Pasting Matchboxes</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>Side business of rural women</p>
<p>Speaking of the side business of rural women, this is also a matter worthy of attention for those who care about women's lives. As far as I know, the side businesses of rural women, such as those in Minhang, Zhoupu, Chuansha, and Nanqiao in the suburbs of Shanghai, are mostly pasting matchboxes as their only side business when they are not busy with farming. According to a survey: At present, rural women paste about 1,000 matchboxes a day, then their remuneration is only 800 yuan in legal currency, and the raw materials for pasting matchboxes—paste—must also be prepared by themselves. Women with nimble hands can paste up to 5,000 matchboxes a day from dawn to dusk, and the remuneration they receive is only 4,000 yuan in legal currency. Under the circumstances of such high living costs, it is impossible for a rural woman to maintain the lives of a family of three or four with the income from pasting matchboxes.</p>
<p>According to a friend who is familiar with the matchbox industry, the rural women who paste matchboxes as a side business are, to put it bluntly, pitiful victims of exploitation. Because at present, the holders of this industry in various towns and villages in the suburbs of Shanghai will never get such meager remuneration from various match factories in Shanghai; however, they take advantage of the weakness of general rural women who have nothing to do during their spare time to exploit them in order to enrich themselves. This is indeed an unreasonable and inhumane thing.</p>
<p>Therefore, how to promote the proper side business of rural women to improve their lives is a fact that the women's community and people who care about women's issues should not ignore at present.</p>
<h3>A Stepmother's Heart</h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>My marriage took place in the autumn of two or three years ago, when I was already thirty years old. Viewed through the eyes of conventional society, it was not an ideal or complete marriage, because I inevitably had to accept the compromise of becoming a second wife due to my advanced age, and my husband's late wife had also left behind a four-year-old child!</p>
<p>But in reality, I wasn't disappointed. I didn't see being a second wife as an incomplete marriage, nor did I resent the fact that my husband's late wife had left behind a troublesome child. I only harbored one belief and resolution: I must make my marriage happy; I must break down the prejudiced notion, inherited from the past, that stepmothers are cruel and mistreat the children of their husband's former wife. I want to be a loving stepmother!</p>
<p>This is not an easy task, because in the context of traditional beliefs, stepmothers have been unconsciously stereotyped as vicious and biased. In the ears of neighbors and in the minds of relatives and friends, your every move will be watched and criticized. But driven by love, and wanting to be an outstanding stepmother, I bravely shouldered this heavy burden!</p>
<p>Our marriage was joyful, both spiritually and materially. My husband has a kind and honest soul. He is a gentle and caring man, and my habits are similar to his. I believe this kind of marriage is often more perfect, because I have seen so much unrest and suffering between couples due to differences in character and temperament, to the point where they cannot understand each other. On this point, I am fortunate. The most serious problem lay with Ming, the child left behind by his former wife.</p>
<p>I will always remember the scene when my husband told Ming to call me "Mom" for the first time after our marriage. Ming was wearing a new woolen sweater, and he slowly ran to me, holding his father's hand. Although his father told him to call me "Mom" several times, he didn't respond, but stared at me with his round, big eyes! Finally, his father seemed annoyed and said, "If you don't call her, I won't like you anymore!" He was startled, and a shadow of pain swept across his face. As if he could no longer bear the grievance, he burst into tears in his father's arms. Poor child, though still young, already knew the pain of losing his mother. A child's emotions are genuine, and I was moved by him. I took his hand, hugged him, caressed his soft hair lovingly, and gently and tenderly whispered in his ear: "Don't cry, Ming. I like you just like your mom did!" Before long, he stopped sobbing, slowly raised his pitiful, red, tearful eyes, and softly called out, "Mom!" After calling out, he threw himself into my arms again! Sincere emotions cannot be forced. As I held him, I felt the special feelings in his little heart at that time, and I felt deeply moved. I couldn't allow his already fearful and sad heart to be hurt any further. I loved him even more than I would love my own child!</p>
<p>From then on, the affection between us, mother and son, grew more harmonious and intimate day by day. First impressions often leave an indelible mark on people! I love him! In my free time, I knit him woolen sweaters. He never acts naughty, and never asks to buy this or buy that. In the evenings, when the three of us sit together chatting or listening to music, he sits obediently on his father's lap or lies in my arms, and our lives become even more perfect. I know that many husbands worry about the fate of the children left behind by their former wives. Of course, they don't dare to say it directly in front of their new partner, fearing that it will cause discord between them, but when they think of their former wife, they feel a deep sense of guilt. That kind of spiritual pain and unease is something outsiders cannot imagine. And my husband, seeing the closeness and harmony between us, I believe, knows those fears have been put to rest!</p>
<p>A year later, my own child was born, but I did not neglect him because of this. On the contrary, I felt that if I showed any bias at this time, it would easily be criticized. I cared for him as I always had. I didn't want him to be reminded of the pain of not having a mother when he saw his younger brother being loved by his mother. For the sake of harmony and affection between the two brothers in the future, I should build a solid foundation of righteousness for them!</p>
<p>Now my child is two years old, and Ming is gradually acting like an older brother. He always shares half of what he eats with his younger brother. In my loving care, there are no boundaries between them! Now, whenever I hear Ming affectionately calling "Younger brother," or see them holding hands and swaying together while playing on the grass, my heart is filled with an unspeakable joy and peace. I hope all the children left behind by their mothers will be blessed. I sincerely bless them!</p>

<h3>Oscar Wilde and America</h3>
<p>— Wang Rui</p>
<p>Recently, Hesketh Pearson's new book, "Oscar Wilde: His Life and Wit," is a vast, bold and delightful read. It is arguably the most complete and faithful critical biography of the genius writer Oscar Wilde in recent years. The book describes many interesting stories about Wilde and is so concise and engaging that one cannot bear to put it down.</p>
<p>In one section, Pearson describes Wilde's trip to America, briefly conveying a glimpse of the great writer's views on the largest modern power. Some people advised George Bernard Shaw to visit the United States, but Shaw politely declined, perhaps influenced by Wilde. Wilde's trip to America was brief, but Pearson believes his criticisms were spot-on. The keenness of a genius's perception seems nothing short of a miracle to the average person.</p>
<p>It is said that Wilde arrived in the United States in 1882 and immediately began a lecture tour. The Broadway theater world presented him with a bouquet of pure lilies. Although he did not accept them, much to the dismay of his butler, the extravagance of his attire was unparalleled. His witty remarks to reporters made his lecture tour a resounding success. The most powerful and memorable of his public pronouncements were the few words he spoke to a customs officer at the New York docks. The customs officer asked, "Do you have anything to declare?" He replied, "I have nothing to declare but my genius."</p>
<p>Wilde's trip to America was akin to a form of revenge for Mark Twain's trip to Europe. After traveling in Europe, Mark Twain published his "Innocents Abroad," frankly mocking what he called high European culture. Wilde mocked America with the same frankness, saying that America had almost no culture to speak of.</p>
<p>He said: "In America, life is one long, dreadful penance." "The first thing that struck me as unreasonable was the American habit of hanging pictures close to the fireplace. When I understood the benefits of this custom, I realized how bad those paintings were."</p>
<p>"The general shallowness of American business and its unfair attitude towards spiritual culture are due to a heretical doctrine in this country, namely, that in America, a man is not fit to be a national hero if he is unable to tell a convincing lie."</p>
<p>The governor of Kriegsville County telegraphed him: "Would you be willing to visit our town and give a lecture on aesthetics?"</p>
<p>Wilde telegraphed back: "Please change the name of your county first."</p>
<p>The name Kriegsville was simply too ugly.</p>
<p>When students at Harvard University listened to Wilde's lectures, they wore shorts and adorned themselves with sunflowers or lilies. Wilde stood firmly on the podium, adjusting his breathing, while wearing a tuxedo. This made the boys feel a little silly, but when he said that he "seemed to see signs of some kind of artistic movement in the classroom," the boys laughed and showed him their warm respect. His warning, "Caricature is vulgarity's tribute to genius," shocked the entire audience.</p>
<p>Wilde's criticisms of all writers were gentle and tolerant, unwilling to needlessly wound the self-esteem of writers. The harshest of his criticisms was a sentence he said to the American painter James Whistler, who, although he had considerable and magnificent achievements, was an extreme egotist. He said: "Whistler seems to me to be one of the masters. I dare say Whistler agrees with my opinion entirely."</p>
<p>This was originally very kind, but once, the art critic for the London Times reviewed Whistler's paintings, saying that in his opinion, this painting was good and that painting was bad, and so on.</p>
<p>Whistler was resentful and said: "Dear friend, you shouldn't say this painting is good and that painting is bad. Good and bad are not the words you should use. But you can say, 'I like this one, I don't like that one.' That's what you're supposed to do. Now come and eat oysters—you'll love them."</p>
<p>"I wish I had said that," Wilde said generously and happily, praising Whistler.</p>
<p>"You can, Oscar, you can," Whistler replied excitedly.</p>
<p>Later, when Wilde mediated the war of words between the painter and the journalist, he said: "Whistler often uses the capital letter 'I' to piece together his works of art."</p>
<p>Shallow people who try to destroy the words and deeds of great writers are equally rude. From New York to San Francisco, many drunkards forced him to indulge in lavish drinking. But every time he drank, he always managed to get those who surrounded him dead drunk, and then, like dead pigs, he piled them one by one into carriages and triumphantly drove the carriages back to his hotel.</p>
<p>Miners in Colorado treated him to a tour of the depths of a gold mine. Wilde praised these miners, saying that their clothes were the best in America. Inside the mine, he told the miners: "Let's sit down and have a feast. The first course is whiskey, the second course is also whiskey, and the third course is still whiskey." The miners were drunk and fell asleep until the sun came up, while Wilde may have already been in another social gathering, talking eloquently, as if attending a London tea party.</p>

<h3>Ancient Art of Persia</h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>Persia, which is today's Iran, has been a country of poets, philosophers, and mystics for centuries. However, in recent years, most people talk about Persian art only in terms of its rugs. Although Persian rugs are famous, they are impractical. The Persians had already created beautiful molded pottery and exquisite fabrics four thousand years before the birth of Christ. Persia, situated between the eastern and western hemispheres, was the center of Near Eastern culture, and it had its brilliant achievements in science, such as astronomy and mathematics, and in art, such as metalwork and pottery.</p>
<p>Persian art is an integral part of the daily life of the Persians. They were gifted in beautifying the bowls they drank from, decorating the vases they used for flower arrangements, and even on the axes they used as weapons, they would try to make them very refined. Later, until 1000 BC, their saddles were also decorated with beautiful bronze ornaments. The carvings on these saddles were discovered in a tomb in western Persia in 1929. The steeds were usually buried in the same tomb as their masters. The bodies of women were often buried in a large bottle.</p>
<p>The beginning of Persian history is marked by its art, which reached its peak in 550 BC. Under the rule of Cyrus the Great and Darius, Persia conquered all the land from the Nile to the Aegean Sea, building the first world empire. In their newly acquired territories, they built monumental structures, decorated with impressive sculptures, and filled with colorful utensils. In 330 BC, they were conquered by Alexander the Great and absorbed ancient Greek culture. Nine hundred years later, the Arabs invaded, and they gained new concepts in mathematics and astronomy. In the thirteenth century, the Mongols entered the Near East, and they were influenced by the great Chinese painters, but the Persians still absorbed and transformed things into their own. They learned new concepts from the Chinese and used bright colors on pottery. Until the fifteenth century, when European art entered the height of the Renaissance, Persian art reached a peak of elegance and refinement that had never been surpassed. The attached image is one of the bronze sculptures on a saddle, depicting the sun god riding a lion, representing the power of the universe. It was cast around 1000 BC.</p>
<h3>Poem Tiles: Continuing the Yangzhou Dream, No. 6</h3>
<p>— Hong Weifa</p>
<p>The past Yangzhou scenery written in Li Dou's "Yangzhou Painting Boat Records" has vanished like a spring dream. However, the poem tiles mentioned in it were used by the author and Ren Erbei and others as their only pastime after work fifteen years ago, and they spent a lot of time on them.</p>
<p>Regarding poem tiles, the "Painting Boat Records" records it this way:</p>
<p>"Poem tiles are made of ivory, half an inch square. Each person gets dozens or hundreds of characters, and they put them together to form poems. It is most difficult and ingenious. The Xiu Garden and Xiao Garden were most popular. Recently, the verses commonly circulated are: Zhang Sike said: 'The boat oar is afraid of being blown away by the wind, the tower is suspected of being breathed into existence.' The monk Yaogen said: 'Rainy window talks about ghosts, the lamp dims first, the tavern discusses swords, and suddenly there is a sound.' Huang Beizha said: 'The flowing water must be the meaning of the exiled, the setting sun is all the soul of a beauty.' Wang Rongfu said: 'Leaves fall, words exhaust the poor alley, lotus decays, sweeping half the lake.' All are witty sayings."</p>
<p>At that time, Ren Erbei was in charge of the Provincial Zhenzhong in Zhenjiang, and the author was working there. When we talked about the poem tiles in the "Painting Boat Records" in our spare time, we were very interested and decided to make a set to try. However, if we used ivory, we were not wealthy salt merchants and it was impossible. If we used bamboo instead, it would be troublesome and unsightly. As a result, we cut corners and used the Xuan paper that was used to print business cards. Moreover, we did not use a square shape, but changed it to a rectangle, with one character written on each card, almost like the paper cards used by ordinary people.</p>
<p>After the paper poem tiles were made, everyone did not agree with the method of "each person getting dozens or hundreds of characters, and they put them together to form poems," thinking that it was too rigid and lacked change. Anyway, it was called "tiles," so it would be more accurate to use the method of playing mahjong. So we decided on new tile rules: (1) The entire set of tiles has 300 characters, with nouns, verbs, pronouns, adverbs, prepositions, etc. all included. (2) At least two people and at most six people per game. (3) The starting tile and dealing are both in order of seating. (4) The first player starts with fourteen tiles, and the rest have thirteen tiles. (5) If the whole game agrees, the tiles can be reshuffled and restarted. (6) You can collect tiles issued by others in order. (7) In addition to the 300 tiles, there are several blank tiles. Each person can keep one blank tile to represent any desired character. If you get a second blank tile, you must discard it. (8) A completed set of tiles has up to ten characters, and up to fourteen characters at most. (9) The sentence structure of the completed set of tiles can be three-character, four-character, five-character, seven-character, or sentences of varying lengths. (10) If most of the people in the same game deny the sentence of the completed set of tiles, the completion of the tiles should be temporarily stopped and the original game should continue. (11) After one person completes a set of tiles, the remaining people can use all the tiles they have to complete sentences, and record them in order of merit.</p>
<p>Once the tile rules were decided, the tile characters also had to be determined. Initially, the author selected more than 1,000 commonly seen characters, which were repeatedly deleted by everyone, leaving 300 characters. Among them, there were the most nouns, followed by verbs and adjectives, and the fewest other parts of speech. After multiple experiments, it was sufficient to be used quickly, so we did not add any more.</p>
<p>From then on, in our spare time, whether we stayed in Zhenjiang on the Iron Pi City Head, or returned to Yangzhou by the Ping Shan Hall, it was mostly a game of poem tiles. In the beginning, everyone's skills were not skilled, and their associations were not flexible. Dealing and collecting tiles often backfired and took a lot of time. Later, it gradually sped up. It took less than an hour to complete a game. After each game was completed, it was recorded at the time, and there were many verses that could be recited, such as "Smoke shrouds the willow threads and adds to the green in the distance, rain rolls the river sails and scatters into the building." "Pitiable is a song of the Peach Blossom Fan, all are new pavilion old tears." "Jade flute softly sings and idly faces wine, setting sun red leaves coldly silent." "Leaving feelings, the wind scatters the leaves, half of spring, a sail is far away." "Smoky flowers pity the dream of parting, wind leaves fill the empty mountain." "Flowing water is pitiable and green, orioles and flowers are another late spring." …</p>
<p>Later, because the "January 28th" national crisis occurred, everyone no longer had the refined interest to play this poem tile game, and not long after, everyone became distressed and separated. Only Erbei was able to suppress his parting feelings after the trial, and compiled the tile rules, tile characters, and poems composed in each game into a volume, mimeographed and sent to the colleagues in the game, named "New Words of the Leaf Game." And on the title page of the volume, he inscribed a quatrain: "Turn new leaves to fight leisure, from then on boredom becomes famous; the best are the new words in the game, setting sun red leaves coldly silent." A postscript was attached: "This collection is completed, but there is no name for it, so I suggest four characters, and jokingly titled a quatrain, nothing but a fascination with the game. However, the word 'game' is not popular, and there are no old articles, what day will there be new words, its creation is laughably so." At that time, the author also wrote a poem in response: "Pitiable life is entrusted to leisure, twisting broken chants and waves to win fame; since the west wind blew and the rain passed, the cicadas and fallen leaves are all silent." Afterwards, Erbei re-edited it and renamed it "Record of Lost Ambition," and the paper poem tiles were printed and published together. Detractors naturally still saw it as "fascination with the game." But times change, and as for today, wanting to gather together again, playing poem tiles, to relieve worldly worries, how can we get it again? This is truly continuing the Yangzhou dream!</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood 97</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>(Previous plot summary) During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, millions of heroic Chinese sons and daughters in our country's rear and occupied areas shed their bright red blood over every inch of mountains and rivers in order to defend their motherland. We have collected these tragic stories to commemorate the hardships of recovering lost land.</p>
<p>The first story—"The Seven Secret Agreements"—recounts how the Japanese pirates colluded with several war demons of Europe, signing seven secret documents to trample on the entire world and destroy all culture.</p>
<p>The young man, Tsurumi Tama, received a purely Japanese education from the cradle to graduation from the Army War College. Perhaps due to his pure bloodline, he was full of a sense of justice and couldn't stand the Japanese pirates' style of poverty—rape, looting, burning, killing, gambling, drug trafficking, extortion, and various criminal behaviors. Just as he was beginning to feel disgusted, he accidentally discovered that he was actually a direct descendant of Mr. Zhan Jihan, an old Chinese Tongmenghui comrade. At the same time, he heard rumors of the "Seven Secret Agreements," so he used his position in the Japanese General Staff Headquarters to recruit comrades and organize twelve secret radio stations to try to reveal the contents of the "Seven Secret Agreements" in an attempt to save the world from this catastrophe.</p>
<p>During the course of his secret work, he discovered that he was in love with a proud and extraordinary Northeastern girl, Ji Yaoqun. Fearing that falling into a love affair would delay his grand plan, he returned to the homeland with a spirit of certain death and plunged into the dragon's den and tiger's lair that was the Black Dragon Society to carry out the work of exploring the "Seven Secret Agreements"...</p>
<p>Volume One: The Seven Secret Agreements</p>
<p>Chapter Six: A Beautiful Figure in the Black Dragon Society</p>
<p>Not far from here is Tokyo Imperial University. The clock on the Hume Building has just chimed twelve times, indicating that it is now midnight and all daytime work should be finished. A certain club, a few dozen steps east of the Hume Building, has already seen its members leave in batches, leaving only the last person. He is wearing a neat tuxedo, looks no more than twenty years old, and the contours of his face bring out a standardized handsome man; the lines of his neck and jaw all delineate calmness and perseverance; the muscles and bones of his whole body grow evenly and harmoniously, making him appear even more energetic.</p>
<p>As he appeared on the mica steps at the entrance of the club, he saw his car, a 1935 Dodge, already silently gliding over from the left and stopping at the bottom of the steps. The driver got out of the car, opened the door, and waited there. He also looked up at the clear blue sky, the bright waning moon, and told his driver to wait for him at the main entrance of Ueno Park first, as he needed to take a walk. The driver bowed in response and drove the car away.</p>
<p>The young man lightly breathed a sigh of relief, and after the car had gone far away, he stepped down the steps and walked slowly eastward, as if admiring the night scenery. His pace was extremely slow, indicating that he was quite tired; this was because since flying across the strait from Shenyang the day before yesterday, he had been subjected to the secret "five-level test" day and night and had not had a good rest. At this time, he had completed all the subjects. If he didn't have extraordinary energy, he would have been too tired to move, but he still retained considerable vitality.</p>
<p>Why did he have to take this "five-level test?" It was just a secret procedure for joining the society: the first level of test is the word "loyalty." During the test, in addition to the six executive committee members with the highest qualifications, probing repeatedly with various questions, there are also very cruel tests. For example, a committee member asks you, "Killing is an act that violates national law and morality. If an executive committee member orders you to kill someone, and you actually kill someone, then that is deliberately breaking the law and doing evil; if you don't carry out the order, then you are violating the orders of the society. How do you solve this problem?"</p>

<p>Mei and Cheng Competing on Stage</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang and Cheng Yanqiu's performances in Shanghai this time have been described by some as a competition, with supporters of both sides cheering and shouting. Because their tastes differ, it is understandable that they support different performers. However, as one of the audience members, we welcome their competition on stage as much as possible. The reason is simple: there are good plays to watch.</p>
<p>It is said that Mei Lanfang is going to perform "The Drunken Concubine." Mei has not performed this play for ten years, which shows one aspect of his efforts to show all his skills.</p>
<p>Security Official Situ</p>
<p>There are many strange sights on Nanjing Road. A pair of stone figures by the racetrack is one, and the Rainbow Temple below the Rising Sun Building is another.</p>
<p>The official name of the Rainbow Temple is Security Official Situ Temple. Every time I pass by, seeing the prosperous incense burning and the huge golden plaque, I always think of Ambassador Situ Leideng, who traveled up and down Mount Lu many times to mediate, and I hope that he can also become a security official Situ.</p>
<p>Now, the ambassador has returned to Beiping and is refusing to see guests, probably because he is too tired from these months. The Nanjing Political Consultative Conference is still continuing. We hope that the ambassador can rest for a few days and then return to Nanjing to continue his efforts.</p>

<h3>A True Story of Jeep</h3>
<p>— Ma Ye</p>
<p>(Editor's note: This self-narration of a jeep introduces some common knowledge in a lighthearted tone, no joking.)</p>
<p>I, "Jeep" (temporarily using the name you cautiously use!), with ample facts and reasons, hereby send the following memorandum to all those who misunderstand me, despise me, curse me, and flatter me, as a serious protest. I, "Jeep," with ample evidence, hereby offer the following supplementary note to the repeated publication of my biography and falsely named confessions in "Free Talk." And a good faith proposal with "Human Life is Paramount."</p>
<p>Clarification</p>
<p>I am first ordered to clarify: "Jeep" is not my original name. According to my investigation, the two Chinese characters "吉普" (Jeep) originated from the American Information Service in the mountain city of Chongqing. This term is now "uniformly" popular throughout China. Although it is rare for a transliteration to be so "unchanging," I find it unacceptable. "Jeep" is clearly a transliteration of "Jeep," but I must state again: "Jeep" is also not my original name, my full name!</p>
<p>I have a very exaggerated and glorious original name, which is: "All-Purpose Vehicle," written in Western language as "General Purpose," because I can devote myself to many skills that other vehicles cannot. I not only transport soldiers, but also transport wounded soldiers, deliver letters, transport firearms, and can also serve as an independent wireless radio transceiver station, military telephone station, first aid small ambulance, field X-ray mobile station, small military repair shop,... There's too much to say, too many to count. President Roosevelt once stood on my back to review the troops. I carried the first batch of soldiers ashore at the Normandy landing; I could sleep in a B-25 transport plane and fly over the "Roof of the World." When the plane landed at Chongqing Airport, I used my own four legs (wheels) to slide down from the transport plane automatically and immediately serve. I can climb mountains, I can wade through water, I can fly, I can crawl through caves... In short, I am all-powerful, and I am worthy of the title "All-Purpose!"</p>
<p>All-Purpose</p>
<p>American veterans initially called me by my full and complete name very properly, but later they said my name was too long and cumbersome, so they abbreviated it to GP. Second, the two letters GP were said to be a little awkward to pronounce, so they changed it again to the abbreviation Geep. This is just like American veterans calling themselves GI. Although the word is shorter, it sounds a bit more affectionate. Since my original name is "All-Purpose Vehicle," I hope that when Chinese friendly people want to abbreviate my name, they will call me "Old Wan." Isn't "Wan" one of the "hundred surnames"? If you don't call me "Old Wan," you can call me</p>
<p>"Little Wan" is also fine, but don't confuse it with the poet's desire for "Little Man," remember, remember! Someone once suggested calling me "Jie," which is also quite acceptable and will be noted for future reference.</p>
<p>Speaking of my family tree: I am a member of my large family. All over the world, there are hundreds of millions of my brothers with the same face and body shape, but each does his own different job. Each person's skill (only picking up young masters and young ladies to school is a special "side job" in China). There are too many of my brothers, so we are not born of the same father and mother. In the United States, the "Ford Motor Company" is famous for its V-shaped eight-cylinder cars, the "Chrysler Company" for its luxury cars, the "Willys Company" for its four-seater small sedans, and the "General Motors Company" for its trucks... But during the war, these famous factories were all the parents of my brothers. In peacetime, "Ford" parts cannot be installed on "Chrysler" cars, nor can they be matched with "Willys" or "General Motors" cars. Only any of our brothers can exchange any piece of clothing. If they are unfortunately disabled, such as a broken arm or leg, a broken heart, the "internal organs" between our brothers can be freely exchanged, regardless of which factory their parents are from.</p>
<p>Parts</p>
<p>My design is the crystallization of American automotive industry design experts. Every part of me is manufactured by the factory that is best at manufacturing that type of part. For example, I have a pair of anti-aircraft eyes (anti-aircraft lights). Its light bulbs, covers, anti-aircraft colored glass, bubble heads... etc., are all manufactured separately by specialized factories.</p>
<p>I have strong resistance and shock resistance, and I also have sufficient speed to gallop. Although I can be controlled, unfortunately, I cannot be autonomous. Therefore, when the "Jeep girl" sitting on my back uses the scent of perfume, a nasal "um" tone of sweet words, and fluttering hair brushing against the driver's cheeks as a multifaceted charming offensive, you, the unfortunate ghosts under the car, appear in front of me. I pity you, you and I are equally innocent.</p>
<p>Please do not curse me and the Jeep girls. Because we and they are equally at the mercy of those adults adorned with badges, collar badges, and chest badges. We lose our freedom and autonomy... I have rumbled in my stomach and shed tears like rain for this:</p>
<p>But my heart is kind. I hope that the supervisors of vehicles will review the drivers, and drivers with conscience and reason will also automatically self-examine to see if their driving skills have reached the standard. Here, I sincerely list a most economical and reliable method, hoping that the vehicle-owning class will implement it immediately.</p>
<p>Please first measure the distance between my front and rear feet (front and rear tires) with a rope, take this measurement as the radius, and draw a circle with white powder on a flat square or a relatively wide and quiet alley floor. Then, measure the distance between my left and right feet (tires) with a rope, widen this measurement by one foot, and draw two straight lines on the previously drawn circle as the car's entrance and exit. In this way, please find someone to witness it, but only allow him to tell you to try again when you fail, and do not allow him to warn you in advance that your driving is about to deviate from the scope.</p>
<p>Driving</p>
<p>Everything is ready, please sit on my back, start me up and drive me into the circle between the two straight lines. You immediately brake and stop, reverse, turn the steering wheel, go forward, brake, and reverse again... In this way, no matter whether you come from the left or the right, my only requirement is that within five minutes, you turn me around in the circle, turn one hundred and eighty degrees, and drive out of the old road between the two straight lines when you drove into the circle. Of course, the front of the car should go first, and the rear of the car should follow.</p>
<p>If you can satisfy what I said above, then you are qualified to obtain a car driving license from any major city in the five continents. Please do not underestimate this famous and internationally used test question. If you fail, try again! If you don't succeed in ten days, aim for a month. Success will surely belong to you in the end.</p>
<p>If you have the above skills and still have an accident, I, "Old Wan," am willing to be crushed to pieces to atone for the crime!</p>
<p>Human life is paramount, and showing off is light. Speed is second, safety is first!</p>
<p>Common Sense</p>
<h3>On Extraterritoriality</h3>
<p>— Wen Yi</p>
<p>Chinese people probably don't have a single person who doesn't feel disgusted by the term "extraterritoriality," but in fact, this is a misunderstanding. Extraterritoriality is not necessarily unequal, and many people often associate extraterritoriality with consular jurisdiction, but in reality, these are completely two different things.</p>
<p>There are two types of extraterritoriality:</p>
<p>(1) Equal extraterritoriality (Extra-territoriality) This type of extraterritoriality applies to foreign ambassadors and ministers, etc., who enjoy the following special rights (Privileges):</p>
<p>1 Diplomats themselves and their suites enjoy special treatment and protection.</p>
<p>2 Diplomatic embassies enjoy special protection.</p>
<p>3 Diplomats sometimes get to meet the heads of state of the host country and attend special banquets.</p>
<p>Those who enjoy this type of extraterritoriality are also exempt from the following obligations (Immunities):</p>
<p>1 Being subject to civil and criminal sanctions in the host country.</p>
<p>2 Not having to serve in the military in the host country, testify in court, etc.</p>
<p>Foreign commercial agents, such as consuls-general, consuls, and vice-consuls, do not enjoy extraterritoriality. However, if the host country provides special treatment, they may also enjoy the benefits of extraterritoriality.</p>
<p>(2) Unequal extraterritoriality (Exlra-territorality) applies to expatriates of the great powers stationed in the Far East (this type of extraterritoriality is only seen in the Far East). Unequal extraterritoriality includes two types:</p>
<p>1 Court jurisdiction (Courtisdiction) such as the special courts previously established by the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan in Shanghai.</p>
<p>2 Consular jurisdiction (ConsularJurisdiction) such as the foreign consuls who previously adjudicated civil and criminal cases in China before most countries established special courts.</p>
<p>Extraterritoriality (unequal) originated in the late Qing Dynasty, and the reason why the great powers wanted to obtain the benefits of extraterritoriality in China was actually due to the poor laws established in the late Qing Dynasty. For example, the law "those who kill shall die" seems to have no flaws, but in fact, it is fundamentally wrong. Foreign countries distinguish between murder (Murder) and manslaughter (Man-slaughter) and determine the severity of the crime, but Chinese old laws prescribe the death penalty for all killings, regardless of whether they are intentional or unintentional. Now let's take an example.</p>
<p>A hundred years ago, a British merchant ship trafficked opium to Guangdong and passed through the Humen Fort. While unloading goods from a sampan, a British sailor accidentally dropped a box of opium from the top floor, hitting a woman's head and killing her. As a result, the Chinese government strongly demanded that the ship surrender the murderer and execute him. Although the shipowner repeatedly explained that it was an accidental death and could not be sentenced to the death penalty, the British sailor was finally executed under the law of "those who kill shall die." This incident aroused criticism and attacks from British newspapers. In order to protect the lives of their expatriates, they had the motivation to demand "extraterritoriality" from China.</p>
<p>During the Washington Conference in 1921, when representatives of the nine countries gathered in Washington, the chief Chinese representative, Shi Zhaoji, proposed the abolition of extraterritoriality for the great powers in China. The representatives of all countries did not object to this proposal, but there was a condition attached: "China must improve its laws within a certain period of time, and after a delegation sent by various countries investigates and approves, the abolition will be carried out." After the Chinese representatives returned to China, they tried to improve the laws, but at that time, it was the era of warlord separatism, and it was quite difficult to improve the laws. After a long time, the investigation team repeatedly asked whether the improvement was complete. As a result, the Chinese government sent a telegram to prevent them from coming, and the matter of "abolishing extraterritoriality" was also shelved in an intangible way.</p>
<p>It was not until after the victory of this war that the extraterritoriality of the great powers in China was completely abolished. However, if we do not strive for self-improvement, all equal and mutually beneficial treaties will naturally deteriorate.</p>

<h3>The Newly Appointed Mayor of Nanjing, Shen Yi</h3>
<p>— Changzhi</p>
<p>According to reports, the newly appointed Mayor of Nanjing, Mr. Shen Yi, flew from Shanghai to Nanjing on the 14th, took office on the 16th, and officially started his duties after holding the first memorial week on the 18th. This is the beginning of Nanjing's transformation from a "received city" to a "constructed city" after becoming the capital.</p>
<p>The construction of Nanjing will be a model for the construction of major cities across the country in the future, and in the case of many people, many opinions, little money, and few materials, building Nanjing and being the mayor of Nanjing is really difficult. We hope that Shen Yi can have extraordinary experience and courage to build Nanjing well and give a new impression to China and foreign countries. Here, I only introduce some of Shen Yi's anecdotes, and I don't want to praise him for how good he is here first. Whether he is good or not depends on the performance of the facts in the future.</p>
<p>When you are sitting in a car and pass from the bottom of North Sichuan Road through Jiangwan to the Qujiang Wharf in the city center, you will see wide, boundless, flat, smooth, and accessible asphalt roads... Neat trees... Great buildings lined up among them. This is the crystallization of the hard work of Mr. Shen Yi, the municipal construction practitioner of the "Greater Shanghai Construction Plan" before the Anti-Japanese War. If Mr. Shen can use his past experience to lead Nanjing, he may be able to be competent and happy.</p>
<p>Before the Anti-Japanese War, Mayor Shen served as the director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works for ten years. He was appointed as an "expert" and served under five mayors. Under the circumstances of national decline and the threat of strong neighbors, he engaged in practical work of municipal construction and was admired by all parties. He is an engineer. During the Anti-Japanese War, he presided over the water conservancy projects in Gansu Province in the rear and served as the director of the Ministry of Communications, assisting the government and participating in the overall anti-Japanese plan, implementing "nation-building politics," and making contributions to the anti-Japanese strategy. This is probably the main reason for his appointment as the mayor of Nanjing this time.</p>
<p>Recalling the year of victory, when the government authorities announced the list of administrative heads of the provinces and cities in the Northeast, they solemnly and sincerely announced to the people: "The Northeast has been occupied for a long time, and the main personnel are carefully selected domestic first-class construction talents." A year after the victory, the authorities believed that the municipal administration of Dalian had not been stabilized for a long time, so they sent Shen Yi to take over. This shows the importance the authorities attach to Mr. Shen. When he was in Dalian, the complex military and political problems in the Northeast had not been resolved, and it is difficult to determine his achievements. Now that Mr. Shen has been transferred to Nanjing, he can probably show his skills.</p>
<p>Regarding Nanjing, everyone knows that the inconvenience of transportation, the disorder of the streets, and the blockage of the sewers are the fatal injuries of the municipal administration. Of course, all these improvements must have money. However, we must never completely blame all the failures that have not been done on "money." The unpopularity of the former mayor of Nanjing stemmed from this.</p>
<p>Here, although there are only a few empty words, they are the general public's high hopes for Mr. Shen Yi. I think he will never disappoint the people!</p>

<h3>The Innocent Murderer 7</h3>
<p>— Xu Guiting</p>
<p>Ruthann frowned and said, "But she'll call the police. She'll pretend to be asleep, and then call the police. You see, women always do that. But Mrs. Meane, I'm not saying you're treating me badly!".</p>
<p>"Even if she does, what's the big deal? You'll have to tell them sooner or later. I thought it was right to call them here now."</p>
<p>Ruthann leaned back in his chair, his hands still in his coat pockets, and said, "Now everything's clear. It's a pity I never got it clear before. My father made my mother suffer a lot, but I loved her very much. Of course, I'm an only child. But she was unfaithful to me, she was still messing around with him, so I killed him first, then shot her with a gun. Do you agree that this is a reasonable thing to do? I believe people in France approve of that."</p>
<p>"When did you shoot her with the gun?" Mean asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, many years ago," he smiled slyly, "The most interesting thing is: if she hadn't messed around with him, how would I have been born?" He looked at Mrs. Mean with what seemed like great affection and said, "This is what Mrs. Mean pointed out."</p>
<p>Bailey said calmly, "But I don't understand how Mrs. Ruthann got mixed up in it. I understand everything about your mother."</p>
<p>Ruthann's face seemed to collapse, expressing great pain, "I don't want to talk about my wife. She's a great kid. If anyone says she's not, he must be a nasty liar." After saying this, he turned to Meane, suddenly sneering, "It's very strange, why did you bother to listen to me talk about the Japanese ghosts? It's not important at all."</p>
<p>"I also thought that this might not be the whole story about you," Meane said, "I suspect you weren't happy to tell me everything before."</p>
<p>"Not so," Ruthann frowned, "Of course I wasn't happy to tell everything before things were clear." He then looked at Bailey, giving her a strangely affectionate smile, and said, "Sorry, I don't want to bore you anymore. Mr. Mean, if you're tired, you can go to sleep."</p>
<p>Bailey hesitated for a moment, forced a smile and said, "You don't mind? I feel a little sleepy."</p>
<p>"Of course not," Ruthann jumped up immediately, his hands still in his coat pockets. He stood silently, waiting until Bailey went out and closed the door. Then, he turned around and sneered: "I can bet you five dollars, she must have run out to call the police. Women always do the same thing. Of course I know, but she stared at me, just like a cat staring at a mouse, what can I do?" He sighed deeply, and at the same time took the gun out of his pocket.</p>
<p>Meane immediately said to him, "Ruthann, please give me the gun!"</p>
<p>"This pistol? Very good." Ruthann immediately put the pistol in his left hand, then stretched it out. At the same time, he punched Meane in the head with his right fist. Meane couldn't dodge in time, took a punch, and fell onto a chair.</p>
<p>Ruthann shouted loudly, "Sorry, Doctor! Sorry, Doctor!" He hurried to the window. His left hand still tightly held the pistol and fiddled with the door for a while, opened the window, and ran away in a puff of smoke. Bailey was still standing in the corridor, her face as white as paper. (To be continued)</p>
