<h3 id="c2">蔣主席剴切致詞　盼舉國一致排萬難求安定　增強力量以加速建國工作 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶十日電〕蔣主席十日晨出席政治協商會議，致開會詞。致詞之前，首謂本人很愉快的向諸位宣布停止衝突的辦法，已經商妥，停止衝突的命令，即可發布。（鼓掌）繼宣讀開會詞，全文如次：</p>
<p>各位先生：今天政治協商會議開幕，本席代表國民政府，向各位致誠摯之歡迎，同時也願乘此時機，陳述我個人對會議的期望。至於政府的方針，我在元旦廣播詞中，已經詳盡說明，不再重述。</p>
<p>今天到會的各位會員，有半數以上都曾參加過歷屆的國民參政會，因此我在今天很自然的聯想到國民參政會的成就。參政會到今天，已是第四屆，而民選的成分，逐漸增加，現在由選舉產生的參政員，已佔總額三分之二。歷屆參政會對國家的貢獻，不一而足，而最重要的，就是共同一致擁護抗戰到底的國策。儘管參政員中間，在政治上的立塲和見解各有不同而對於國家民族安危存亡所繫的根本大計，其主張則是全體一致，始終一貫的。我們所以能持久抗戰，護得勝利，這是一種主要的力量。現在我們抗戰已告勝利，我們中國對這次世界大戰中的任務，正如其他聯合國一樣，要贏得勝利，並且要贏得和平，所謂贏得和平，就一般的說，是要確實保持勝利的成果，建立世界和平的秩序，永絕侵略戰亂的根源，而就我們中國來說，尤其要緊接着抗戰的勝利，以舉國一致的努力，排除萬難，以謀國內秩序的安定，和建國工作的進行。</p>
<p>集中力量　開始建國工作</p>
<p>本會議召集的目的是邀集各黨派代表和社會賢達，來共商國是。我們所要商討的，是國家由戰時度到平時，由抗戰進到建國的基本方案，也就是怎麼樣集中一切力量，增强一切力量，以開始建國工作的問題。我們八年苦戰，死者爲國犧牲，生者備嘗痛苦，唯一的目的，就是在保障民族的生存，排除建國的障得，以求得這一個復興建設的良機。現在抗戰旣已勝利結束，建國工作就應該立即開始。我們中國必須實行三民主義，已爲全國所公認，中國必須成為統一民主而强盛的國家，更是世界所切望。所以我們一方而要努力促成國民大會的如期召集，民主憲政的及早實施，同時，我們要在國民大會召開以前，集思廣益，羣策羣力，來消除一切足以妨得意志統一，影響安寗秩序，和延緩復興建設的因素，以充實我們建國的力量，加速我們建國的進行。政府召集本會議的旨趣，就在於此，本會議的使命與任務，也就在於此。</p>
<p>加強法治　建立憲政基礎</p>
<p>我們過去因為進行着生死存亡的抗戰，一切的招置與法令，都着重於適應軍事的要求。抗戰結束以後，我們的工作應該「善後爲先，建設第一。」許多戰時法令，已經在陸續廢止或修改，今後政治上和社會上一切的設施，都要盡量納之於正常的軌轍，加强法治的精神，以立憲政的基礎。參加本會議的各位先生，對於此點，一定是具有同感的。如有意見，深望盡量陳述，政府無不可以考慮採納，但是我們必須注意國家社會現實的狀况，總要使過渡期間，不發生困難或紛亂，使國家根木不至於動搖，以期順利推行憲政，而使建國工作得以圓滿進行。</p>
<p>人民要求　安定復興統一</p>
<p>本會議雖然不是由人民選舉而產生，但各位先生熱心國事，關切民生，一定能體察人民眞正盼願望，認識人民迫切的要求。國父有言：「國家之基本在於人民。」所以人民的要求，與國家的需要，必然是符合的。依本席的視察，今天我們人民最迫切的要求，是求安定，求復興，求國家的統一進步與繁榮，以增進他們的生活。最低限度也要求他們的生活有保障，使他們得以安居樂業，使他們的自由不受侵害。對於這一點，政府當然要負責盡職，以滿足人民的願望，解除人民的痛苦，保障人民的自由。同時本會議所要充分商討的，也就要以這些最迫切的要求爲基礎，來確定我們當前的國是。我們中國必須實現民主，這是我們國民革命一貫的宗旨，也是這次艱苦抗戰的目的。但在國民大會沒有召集，憲政沒有實施以前，人民眞正的意志，還沒有充分表達的途徑，我們大家的責任，却是十分的沉重。政府這次召集本會議，祗有責任和義務的觀念，決沒有自私和得失之見。政府對於本會議的決定，只要有利於國家的建設，有裨於人民的幸福，有助於民主的推進，無不傾誠接納。同時，我個人在會議開始的今天，要對各位貢獻下面幾點的意見：</p>
<p>眞誠坦白　樹立民主楷模</p>
<p>第一，要眞誠坦白，樹立民主的楷模。我們這一次會議，當然不是爲各黨派解決自身問題的會議，而是爲共同奠定建國基礎的會議。我們各人對於國事的見解，和政治上的主張，必不能絕對相同，或許有距離甚大，但是我希望各位在鞏固國本的共同認識之下，都能充分坦白的提出主張，不必有所隱諒或保留。我們正可以藉此熱烈討論的機會，從各種不同的見解中，發現共同的途徑。從相互的諒解中，增進我們的合作精神。惟有坦白，纔見得眞誠，也唯有犧牲成見，擇善而從，纔能成立合理而有益的決議。應主張的就積極主張，該讓步的應不惜讓步。我們要以這一次爲民主精神的試驗，也要以這一次爲養成民主風度的嚆矢。我們希望本會議能始終保持諒解與和諧，不希望發生任何的停頓和波折。</p>
<p>大公無私　顧全國家利害</p>
<p>第二，要大公無私，顧全國家的利益。我們的諒解與讓步，有一個共同的指歸，這就是國家民族的利益爲先，而黨派或個人的得失爲後。在國家民族整個的利益之前，所有黨派或個人部分的成見，應無不可以犧牲，無不可以讓步。爲了成立有效的決議，有時候撤消我們的提案，比之堅持我們的主張更有偉大的價値。這樣纔見得我們謀國的公忠，纔能使這次會議有確實的成就。</p>
<p>高瞻遠矚　正視國家前途</p>
<p>第三要高瞻遠矚，正視國家的前途，我們在舉行會議的中間，有三件事大家要牢記在心：（一）是抗戰期中軍民犧牲的壯烈，（二）是我們同胞流離痛苦渴望解救的迫切，（三）是我們國家過去蒙受憂患的深重，和民族前途安危禍福的不可預知。所以我們這一次會議，是要集中力量，而決不可以分散力量。是要造成團結，而決不可以破壞團結。是要扶助政府，增強政府，而決不是要削弱政府。是要開闢建國的前途，促使我們國家的進步，而決不可以使國家停滯在百事落後的地位，甚而至於造成國家的退步。只要我們能認識這幾個要點，而後我們國家乃可以邁進於民主建設的大道，爲世界友邦所尊重　各位先生，木席對於這一次會議，是具有充分的信心，我深感我們過去國民參政會的精誠合作，已經贏得抗戰的勝利，我因此同樣深信，這一次會議的成就，必能推進建國的工作，保持勝利的成果，以贏得和平。世界輿論所屬望，人民殷切的祈求，都集中於我們這一次政治協商會議，敬以十分的誠意，禱祝本會議的成功，詞畢。</p>
<p>保障自由　承認政黨地位</p>
<p>主席繼宣現在我還要乘此機會，向各位宣布，政府決定實施的事項。　「人民之自由」人民享有身體、信仰、言論、出版、集會、結社之自由。現行法令，依此原則，分別予以廢止或修正。司法與警察以外機關，不得拘捕審訊及處罰人民。</p>
<p>「政黨之合法地位」各政黨在法律之前，一律平等，並得在法律範圍之內，公開活動。</p>
<p>「普選」各地積極推行地方自治，依法實行由下而上之普選</p>
<p>「政治犯釋放」政治犯除漢奸及確有危害民國之行爲者外，分別予以釋放。</p>
<h3 id="c3">停止衝突令頒布　成立執行總部組織考察團 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>

<p>〔本報北平九日電〕今日對東北局勢前途，似任何人均難作肯定之預測。刻中蘇雙方軍事當局，已商妥十五日交接潘陽防務，但届時能否實現，仍須視事實演變如何而定。上月今日，杜聿明所部，已進至新民城，審陽實已近在咫尺，時逾一月，而北寗淺之局勢，乃與月前無大差異。推其原因，並非遭受共產軍且碍，因其力量殊非雄厚，一擊即潰，主要原因，仍係外交方面，未盡妥貼，恐與蘇軍有誤會。總明之杜聿明將軍，乃利用時間，將其利劍指向北，方澄淸北寗綫左側局勢，並掌握由內蒙通往東北之孔道。至北寗綫附近蘇軍駐防情形，據蘇方通知，新民縣新立屯縣，駐有蘇軍，而實際因採購關係。打虎山黑山一帶，亦有蘇軍散佈，前有蘇軍參謀長與我前綫師長接洽，表示歡迎國軍入瀋，我亦曾派大員，前往設營，世杜聿明將軍最後考慮結果，仍決定暫時不作非正式接防。今後是否東進，尙待最高當局之命令。目前杜聿明將軍正傾力于黑山以北，阜新以東之地區，今後杜將軍之次一目光，似將投射于過去滿淸皇帝之夏日避暑遊獵之所。現在作戰于風雪前綫之國軍，士兵冬服，仍未齊備，每軍僅領到半皮大衣二萬件，毛帽尙未領到，士兵多手脚凍壞，行動維艱，俟最精銳之新一軍新六軍等伙伴到達後，彼等始可脫卸最重要任務，而稍息仔肩。</p>
<p>〔本報北平八日電〕熊主任式輝，今午專機飛錦視察。軍政部特派員郜子舉中將，亦另機飛往。一般判斷，熱河局勢，短期內將有新發展。</p>

<h3 id="c10">聯合國首屆全體大會 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>聯合國首屆全體大會昨日在倫敦揭幕。昨日適爲前國際聯盟在凡爾賽剏立的二十六週年紀念日，可謂巧合。相信聯合國大會當可完成國聯所未能完成的使命。溯自進行擊潰軸心戰事以來，軍事上的發展往往與政治上的發展同時展開。這其間有卡薩白蘭卡，開羅，德黑蘭，魁北克，克里米亞等盟國主要首長的會商，與不列登塢，鄧巴頓橡樹園，舊金山等的國際會議，而一切努力均在如何組織一個堅强的聯合國機構。以確保世界的永久和平。經過迭次的初步會商，聯合國首屆全體會議始於昨日召開於倫敦。對於這個具有歷史意義的國際會議的召開，全世界的人民，特別是亞洲的人民，中國的人民，在經過了長期戰禍之後，無不寄予熱切之期望。</p>
<p>聯合國的組織，是世界人類經過這次空前大戰的慘痛經騐以後熱烈要求的結果。聯合國的人民從戰爭中得到敎訓，得到和平不可分和「天下一家」的敎訓。在今日，任何一地的和平遭到了破壞，必將影響其它各地，乃至世界整個的和平。人類在世界第一次大戰中，本已得到了慘痛的經騐，因而有國聯的機構，希望維繫國際間的和平。但當第一次世界大戰之後，這個國聯組織受到了所謂先天不足的影響，以致不能發揮其應具有之權力，終至第二次世界大戰又於二十年內爆發。人類在飽受了戰爭的創傷以後，鑒於已往的錯誤。所需要的是一個堅强的國際組織；這個願望，就表現在聯合國機構的組成。</p>
<p>聯合國這個國際組織與過去的國際組織，在性質上原有不同的。第一，聯合國的組織以這次對軸心國家作戰的國家，特別是對軸心作戰的主要國家爲主體。這些國家遭遇了軸心的侵略，用血，用肉，用無量數的人的生命，將軸心擊潰了，他們殷切地希望可以有持久的和平。聯合國這個組織是流了無量數聯合國人民的血而培養出來的。血的交流，使他們有對於國際組織的新認識。第二，這次聯合國的組織主要是在故羅斯福總統的感召下而成立，且得美國的積極支持。在擊潰軸心的戰事上，美國盡了最大的努力。由於第一次世界大戰後國際組織不健全的慘痛經騐，美國在聯合國的組織上，亦與在擊潰軸心戰爭的努力上一樣，盡了最大的努力。像這樣一個組織，不但負有維繫持久的世界和平之使命，且可發揮其權力而達成其所負之使命。</p>
<p>聯合國首屆全體會議之召開於倫敦，就在正式產生這個機構，來運用它的機能以維繫世界和平。據傳這次首屆全體會議的議程，除處理有關原子能的管制問題以外，包括：（一）選舉安全理事會非常任理事六席，以與中美英蘇法五國最占勢力之委員會合作。非常任理事之選舉，當按地域分配；（二）選舉聯合國機構秘書長；（三）推定軍事委員會，指導安全理事曾應請各國分担之軍額；（四）托管制的實施問題；（五）聯合國永久會址問題。在這以外，自然還可能討論到旁的問題。就這些議程來看，可知這次全體會議的主要任務是將聯合國的機構組織起來，使這個機構能够早日運轉。在如何運轉這個聯合國的機構來發揮它的權力上，聯合國與過去的國際聯盟，不可相提並論。這次聯合國的組織以美國爲主要柱石，與國聯的未曾得到美國參加，先後皇着極有趣的輝映。紐的時報在送美國代表團赴英出席聯合國首屆會議之際，會說：「如果美國曾加入國際聯盟，同時聯盟會員國能冒小險以避大難，並對侵略國採取斷然措置，則國際聯盟成功之機會必更良好。」現在的聯合國組織，旣有美國的積極參加，在其機構的運轉上，鑒於過去國聯的失敗，深信必能做到冒小險以避大難。</p>
<p>在舊金山會議的時候，我國代表團曾提出中國爲欲促使聯合國成爲一個堅强的組織，準備拋棄一部分主權，交付與聯合國。這一主張的被提出，一時博得美國與論界一致的推戴，認爲支持聯合國組織最具意義的舉措。美國代表羅斯福夫人在抵達倫教的時候，亦向各報記者宜稱：「原子炸彈已令全世界人民瞭然於聯合國機構之責任，成功非僅爲我人希望之事，必須從事工作，並交出我人所有一切。」可見欲使聯合國組織發揮其最大效能，必須「交出我人所有一切」，包括國家的主權若干成分在內。過去國際機構的錯誤，就山於將國家看得太高，將國際組織看得太輕，這一種態度，已不再適合於像目下這樣一個原子能的時代了。</p>
<p>倫敦召開的聯合國首屆全體會議，對於聯合國機構的組織上，必將有重要的協議，自不待言。關於聯合國永久會址問題，聞決從美國波士頓及紐的附近兩地擇一選用。會址的選擇是僥有意義的舉施。波士頓在美國歷史上雖爲名城，其地又有世界著名的學府和文化機關，但在聯合國的會址上，我們覺得紐約的海德公園似較波士頓為尤宜。在擊潰軸心的努力，羅斯福總統為人類盡了不可磨滅的貢獻。羅斯福總統雖不會看見聯合國機構的產生，但聯合國的組織，實由羅斯福總統的感召。今聯合國集五十一國之代表爲世界謀持久之和平，倘其會址能設於羅斯福總統生前生長遊憇，生後陵墓所在之故鄉，各代表得於折衝橡俎討論會議之間，緬懷美國故大總統對於人類的豐切偉業，深信在精神及心裏方面必能起一種侵良的作用，於世界和平的維擊大有裨益。</p>

<p>〔合眾社倫敦十日電〕五十一個聯合國代表全體大會，今日在此正式揭幕。此或係人類阻止未來戰爭之最後一次企圖。開幕時間爲下午四時（上海時間午夜）其時開會鈴聲響澈威斯敏斯德古寺附近之中央會堂。首由英首相阿特里致開會議，樓述新國際機構之一般問題。小國代表之一比利時外長斯巴克將被一致推舉爲第一次大會主席，嗣後各代表即開始聯合國機構組織工作，此一工作需四至六星期內究成。彼時將宣告休會，至下半年在美國永久會址再度召集。此次所感　刺性者，今日之集會適爲各國企圖保持世界安全集體行動開始日之第廿六週年紀念，蓋上次大戰後各國代表聚集於日內瓦，組織國際聯盟之日，正爲一九二〇年之一月十日也。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十日電〕出席聯合國大會各主要代表經兩日來之幕後廣泛討論後，昨夜榮受英王之陸重招宴。會議前舉行非正式集合之主旨，厥爲保障聯合國機構大會之順利進展。至於討論主題，迄今未有披露，然一般人相信棘手之蘇聯問題·蘇土爭執·及西班牙問題，當已在集議中提出。大會之最重要問題，乃爲組織原子彈管制委員會，此點諒將有繁重之討論。聞中國外長王世杰未能參與大會，故中國代表團將由駐英大使顧維鈞率領之。蘇聯表團則由副外委長維辛斯甚領導。各通訊社及報館均己完成極週密之佈置，俾以此歷史性會成之進展情形，隨時報告全世界。</p>
<p>對原子能管制　列強無異見</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十日電〕聯合國機構首次大會，定今日在此間舉行，各代表均從事擊後之準備，並研究大會議程，同時美國務鄕貝爾納斯駁斥列强絕對最重要之原子炸彈問題，意見歧異之種種傳說。貝爾納斯昨夜稱：按照莫斯科決議案措辭，防範辦法顯將施諸委員會所提任何計劃之各階段，而委員會所提任何計劃，當然須提交各政府，依照其憲法需要而批准之。貝氏又稱：關於莫斯科決議，從未有加以修正之問題，美國頗關切於聯合國機構之成功，渠將留此，直至會議已在成功之途。渠意聯合國機構此次會議，將以討論組　之細則爲限云。</p>
<p>本屆大會工作　側重組織性</p>
<p>據本社外交訪員稱：如有期望此次會議立刻解決世界各項懸案者，諒將失望。大會之最先工作，乃爲組織性與制法性者，傳使此機構得以有效的實現，並得以處理其雙重任務，即開始全世界之經濟復興與使和平不致破碎是。僅必要機構之設置，工作已甚繁重，或將耗去各代表在大會初次會議中之全部時間，抑世界負責政治家畢集倫敦，乃有在大會會議室以外，從事許多重要討論之機會，而歐洲將來事態之形成，或亦將在大會之外詳加討論。五强外畏之次長均將在倫敦草擬對義·保·羅·芬·匈·之和約。大會議程中未特別述及之困難問題，尙有與土耳其·里文達·巴勒斯坦·印度尼西亞及中國有關各事。而德國之管制問題，如果不在倫敦更進一階段，則將亦令人驚詫。此外，美·英·法外長將獲一良好機會，討論關於法國與西班牙之今後步驟。法國代表團究由何人率領，仍待戴高樂將軍作最後之決定。</p>

<p>〔聯合社倫敦十日電〕英王喬治六世昨晚在聖詹姆士宮公宴聯合國大會各國首席代表，即席以莊重語調致詞，略謂：「全世界人類及其萬代子孫之福，緊於諸君之手，諸君負責奠定新世界之基礎。最近一次戰爭幾使吾人之世界瀕於殲滅，今後必須永不再蹈覆轍。新世界中男女均可充份認識前途之光明，但當前之目的，非努力及犧牲不能達到。各國加入聯合國爲會員，乃爲一種服務，非自私自衛，或爲一國之利益，而為對整個國家社會服務，此乃顯而易見之特微。現有一種原動力，必須感召一切行動，俾以合作·諒解·及善意的精神，應付一切困難。聯合國當前遭遇之各項工作，乃世界和平的十字軍，不能立即完成，亦不能全部完成，除非吾人能相互諒解忍耐及寬恕，始足濟事。」</p>
<h3 id="c13">善救工作　可獲合理支援 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十日電〕聯合國首久全體大會，可望對善後救濟總署之工作，通過新的補助，英代表團決定於開會時，提議集體支援善救總署。再就現勢觀，如不加緊合作以減輕戰後經濟之痛苦，解決緊急之問題，恐僅憑國際政治合作，猶不足以維持持久和平。英代表團之建議，可使聯合國全體了　善救署之重要與困難，俾使該署成爲國際協力復興之有力工具，山聯合國爲其後盾，使其續費得以充裕。第一次大戰後，呼　善後救濟工作中，大部份為南　氏一人之功勞，此次大戰後之善後救濟問題。較前次史爲重大，然而尙未聞有人倡導合理之支援，英國之建議，於通過以後，可使善救總署直接由聯合國機構秘書處負責，續費旣可獲得保障，而各國政府　洽時亦可較為便利。</p>

<p>麥孚里克並稱，予完全贊成對華親善政策，但此項親善政策須戰後關係爲基礎。中國目下並無意便利美商在中國恢復營業，此種不安定情形，必須立即予以解除。美國駐華使館官員人數極其不足，必須大加擴充，並加以增設。國務院自中國方面所得情報如不充分，絕難賢明的處理對華關係云。</p>

<p>〔聯合社東京十日電〕日本總選舉日期，將由聯合國統帥郃決定，至今尙未宣布，似爲解決現內閣危機一大關鍵。平常消息靈通之日人方面於今日宣稱：內閣有全體辭職之可能，其勢有增無减，主要問題則爲幣原首相是否將重膺任命，或另易新人。若早日舉行總選，幣原或將暫時保留其閣員，俟選舉後再組織政黨政府，如選舉延期數月，或須另問新首相。惟最後決定於何日舉行大選，迄今尙無指示。據有勢力之美國人方面表示意見，謂肅淸不合格候選人及改組政黨係兩重問題，再加以選舉籌備手續，欲望在春季前舉行投票，不免令人懷疑，日人方面則謂多數閣員已深信有總辭職之必要，如有六七閣員辭職，幣原個人自亦不能戀棧，但可於事先約定，提出總辭職後，由日皇重行任命，再組新閣。日人多信此事將在幣原銷假前，或於回任時實行之。此外尙有一辦法，即由幣原陳請統帥部暫准有問題能閣員留任，或准其全體辭職，而另任新首相。據消息靈通方面稱：幣原將與其親信商議後，再作再後決定，惟內閣方面已在暗中作辭職準備，俟決定後實行。政治活動仍在表面下進行，外相吉田與其他主要閣員，頻往相府訪問，並間吉田曾與其岳父前宮內大臣牧野作密切接洽，牧野深得日皇信任，爲現在日本統治界中之關鍵人物。據新聞界報告：自由黨黨魁山曾於招待記者時宣稱：幣原政府毫無能力，致引起目前社會之不安，自由黨宜與社會民主黨合作，組織新內閣以謀補救，此爲本黨對國家應負之責任。本黨雖承爲現內閣爲總選舉前之臨時內閣，然以時局益趨嚴重，不得不改變此項態度。社會民主黨發言人亦於同時宣稱，如能在閣員中獲得四席，自當提出人選。觀察者以爲兩黨作此建議，或謀在下屆內閣中增加代表，惟是否有充分實力以組織一完全內閣，不免令人懷疑云。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓九日電〕據史密遜學院最近報告：暹羅產有一種身體粗大的鯰魚，能呑食石頭，曾經在一條鯰魚的胃裏，找到大如人拳的石塊。若說鯰魚眞的以石頭充飢，似乎難以想像，大約是在嚙食水藻的時候，水藻和石頭黏在一起，一不小心才把石頭呑下吐去。到暹羅的河流中去巡視，正無與看一次海產展覽會，可以發現許多奇事，有一種魚能够向昆虫噴射，使其落入水中，然後吞食，另外一些魚不能在水中濟伏過久，否則便會涮斃。更有一種小魚，歡喜爬上岸邊搬食虫類。此外還有一種鯉魚，它的鼻子已經發展成爲吸管，能在水中用鼻子吸住石頭。那稱呑食石頭的鯰魚，大可以和他訂立合同，各取所需，就是當鯰魚咄食海藻的時候，讓鯉魚吸住石頭。免得把石頭呑下肚去。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕此次宋院長重行蒞滬，對於本市復趨上漲之物價，得以抑平，頗爲各界所感戴，宋氏昨晨九時在中國銀行二樓召集金融界負責人舉行重要會議。</p>
<p>重要會議</p>
<p>到浙江興業銀行徐寄庼，新華銀行王志莘，金城銀行徐國懋。大陸銀行許漢剿，上海銀行伍克家，浙江實業銀行陳篤如，國華銀行沈叔玉，中南銀行胡惠奪，鹽業銀行蕭彥和，四行儲蓄會周　孫，國貨銀行張竹嶼，聚興誠銀行楊培昌等，至中國銀行三樓院長辦公處，除詳詢各行現況外，對今後促進生產建設及中央處理收復區財政金融之方針均有詳盡指示，同時對遲　未公佈之新匯率，亦曾提出商討，聞原則已在決定。一俟宋氏返渝後，當可公佈。至外傳新匯率採分級制，將屬不可能，會議至十時半始散。</p>
<p>今晨飛京</p>
<p>宋氏於會後復在辦公室延見中委潘公展，江蘇監察使程中行，並接見外交部駐滬辦事處主任陳國應，陳氏就「白爾丁」號非法運回法國納粹分子卡可平諾事件之交涉與處理經過，提出報告，宋院長認爲陳氏對此事件之處置，頗爲適當。下午三時復到辦公處召見彭學沛。劉攻芸，垂詢關於上海區敵僞產業處理情形，晚膳後六時，又到處處理重要公務，上海市工務局局長趙祖康曾往晉謁，聞宋院長定於今晨乘機飛京，隨宋院長來滬之一行人員，亦同機赴京。</p>
<p>出售物資</p>
<p>〔合衆社訊〕行政院長宋子文今日訓令上海敵產處理委員會，以低價出售大量棉布·冬服·米糧·台灣糖·冷氣魚肉，藉以抑低物價·宋氏令該委會利用一切方法，完遂政府當局之穩定物價計劃，並抑低目前各物之市價。渠透露：因市上缺貨，煤價聯漲至每噸美金四百元，茲對燃料之管理與越南煤之進口問題，已採取措置矣。</p>
<p>陳長桐談</p>
<p>記者昨訪中國銀行國外匯兌部經理陳長桐氏，據談：政府對外匯問題，曾作縝密商討，並廣徵意見，目前已至公佈階段，大約宋院長返渝後，即可決定公佈。陳氏繼答稱：新外匯率之厘訂，將以物價作標準，其所以遲遲未經公布者，即以各地物價，懸殊過甚，目前物價已趨平定，故料新外匯率之公佈，殆已指日可待。陳氏嘗與中外商業人士徽詢意見，進出口商對於現所產生之自然匯率，並不以爲過高或過低，陳氏對外傳新匯率將分幾個等級之說，予以否定。謂外匯以單純劃一爲佳，以杜流弊。但對奢侈品等，將予以限制。據陳氏意見，提高關稅限制外匯之最佳方法。政府對外匯政策，決獎勵出口，務使我國際收支獲得平衡。陳氏又稱：匯率漲落糜定，易使商人受風險，物價亦將隨之動盪，影響民生，依照布利頓森林協定，各國對於匯率之調整，僅限百分之十以內，超過此限度，則須由國際會議決定。故我外匯率公布後，將一反過往之每日掛牌制度，務使其能有長時期之穩定。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕轟動全市之李澤一案，高院原定昨晨九時四十分在提監橋該院特別刑庭開審。未至九時半，李澤之妻。弟，到庭旁聽，各報社記者亦絡譯而來，達七八十人。於朔風寒氣中，鵠候至九時半，仍未聞有開庭消息，時李澤所延辯護律師陳霆銳亦至，詢諸法警，則答稱今日並無案件開審。然各人傳票明明寫出十日上午九時四十分。</p>
<p>重加偵查改檢查庭</p>
<p>嗣由該院職員透露：本案為愼重計，已發交高檢慮再行偵查，然後決定是否提起公訴。甫於此時，李澤由法警自獄中帶至辦公室，昂首而過，惟面色憔悴，鬢　滿頭，所御藍呢單袍，領間衣鈕亦未扣好，未幾檢察官戴雲鐸蒞庭宣告：本案已由高院移交本處重行偵查，偵查期內依法不得旁聽。法警驅衆離庭，衆人大譁，羣起責問，嗣由戴檢察官詳爲解釋，說明收到傳票之證人，仍可按次入庭對質，眾始離庭。</p>
<p>曾任為職謂非自願</p>
<p>李澤首被傳入，訊問約半小時，李對「商統會」理事及「十六種商品評價委員會」兩僞職均承認，惟梅係環境所迫，並非自願。繼傳職工代表韓武成。舒月橋·姚卓人·葉秋彬·等四人先後入庭對質，韓等當繳呈證件，證明李澤確曾任僞職，檢察官送令四人具結，聲明如係共嫌誣告，甘願受罰，罰則爲徒刑七年。繼再傳新新公司高級職員黃振光及森大鐵廠韓志明·志援各隨帶卅三年九月份帳册入庭核對。據韓等稱：水汀百餘隻係森大鐵廠向新新公司購入，共計價款僞幣二百〇七萬四千元，第一次付五十萬，第二次六十萬，第三次全數付淸。全係上海興業銀行支票。查該銀行業經遵照財部命令停業淸理，當須待吊閱該銀行往來帳册後，方能證明。審訊畢時已一點廿分，計耗時二小時又半。昨日下午五時，新新職工代表韓武成等十人接得淞滬警備總司令部稽查處傳票，着於今晨十時赴該部聰候訊間，惟未傳舒月橋，亦未寫明被傳案由。</p>

<p>烚赤昨續趨下游，執貨者都感乏味，紛紛了結，另謀出路，形勢成一面倒，惟過程平庸，盤旋殊多，晨開八四萬五後，自八四萬七逐漸下挫，中途雖不乏數戶趁低收納，但力量有限，終難見挺，大戶隨波逐流，見勢不佳，紛紛轉移目標於洋股及公債，市况逐步衰落，午刻已步降至八二萬五左右，午後亦然，業中人意興闌珊，交易寥落，結果較前收續挫一萬，銀樓飾金掛八萬八，紋銀七百元，銀元四百五至四百六，暗拆仍在六分至九分間，金市呆滯，游資趨往公債及新港票，另謀發展，設無特殊刺激，金市當更沉寂。</p>
<p>美鈔仍扼於金市之不振，而難振作，惟局勢尙形穩健，晨初略見好轉，無如金市每况愈下，逐被帶小，午刻曾退入一四二〇元以內，而後稍被拉上，結果較前收跌十五元，港票受證券帮大戶所垂靑，游資紛紛跟隨而來，紛購新貨，以致新貨步倘，結果老貨以無投機氣氛而平庸，新貨則漲起五元·</p>

<h3 id="c72">海上長征 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— 莊君朋</p>
<p>海是那麼遼闊，天是那樣高遠，水通天，天連水，水湧起了白色的浪花，四周只是水天相接，看不見一片陸地，天上浮着一朶一朶的彩雲，隨着風兒飄來飄去，海上飛着三五成羣的海鷗，一忽兒高飛，冲人雲香，一忽兒低飛，掠水而飛舞。</p>
<p>一隻自由“Liberty”，號的帆船，正向着南方前進！船上坐着十幾個年靑的中國男女，他們崇拜自由，酷愛自由，想用他們的力量去開闢自由，發掘自由，創造自由，培植自由，孕育自由，……建立一個「自由」的「新天地」——烏托邦。船在海的中央，揚起了帆，當住了舵，向前駛去，駛去，浪花衝擊着船舷，突然吐出一道白沫，浪越來越大，風愈吹愈緊，我們底小舟眞是太渺小了，在碧波裹徘徊，布帆似乎受不住在風的猛襲，幾次三番將要傾倒或折斷，把舵者雖然天天掉換，可是他們沒有航海的經騐，幾天的勞頓，弄得精疲力盡，好像只有任其自然，隨着風前進，他們和她們與風浪搏鬥！</p>
<p>這次海上長征，自然要遭受在風和駭浪，但是船上的伙伴，毫不在意，一點不覺得懼怕，爲了要「逃避現實」，甘胃遠行的危險，十分十二分的願意忍受，他們看不慣殘酷的戰塲，他們過不慣僞裝的樂園，他們深知和平是人類的偽君子，他們熟諗戰爭是人類的野心家，他們懷疑什麼呌做公理？什麼呌做正義？什麼呌做民主？什麼呌做自由？什麼呌做幸福？…他們有堅强的信念，勇敢的精神，誰都自信；「不久的將來，他們會駛到幸福的彼岸，自由的樂土，——他們可以在那裏建立烏托邦，——無錢國，顯然他們受過金錢的迫害和壓榨。</p>
<p>他們不但不怕風，不怕浪，反打起不屈不撓的精神，繼續前進又前進！他們有時看看天空中的浮雲，蒼狗變幻須臾；有時看看海上的白鷗，自由自在地翱翔；有時看者碧波萬頃的海；有時看看白色的浪花，有時興致所至，合唱一支「自由」之歌曲，「平等」「博愛」……兼伴奏着口琴，抑揚頓挫，多麼悅耳！他們酷愛「自由」，恐怕要比他們自己的「生命」還要「可貴」。尤其他們看見海鷗一忽兒冲上靑天，一忽兒掠過海水，這種「自由」的生活，眞够地們的羨慕。</p>
<p>夜來了，整個的海包圍在黑暗之中，所以他們辨不出東西南北，鼻子裏只覺得有一種鹽味的氣息，耳朶只聽到怒濤的澎湃，他們雖然可以說海上生活已有十幾天了，可是這種遭遇還是初次，也許「天公」不肯「做美」，故意和他們「爲難」吧！前途如此險惡，不能使他有半點兒灰心，反增加了勇氣百倍，努力前進，大家爲了要壯壯自己的胆，不約而同唱了一支「伏爾加船夫曲」，因爲大家提高了嗓子唱，於是比前次唱得更響更有勁，風却也在發怒似的在吹，不幸布帆給風兒吹去了半截，不能再乘風而去，大家雖吃驚不少，但也無可如何，素性將下半截風帆卸了下來，反正會使船身平穩些。</p>
<p>夜深了，風緊浪大，船兒的身子，不免東傾西斜，任其在海中前進，船上有一位最年靑的明强說：「怎麼啦！船兒爲什麼不動了，難道這船觸礁不成？年紀稍大的自强笑着說：「不要害怕！這裏沒有礁，如何會觸礁呢？……」船長黎明說：「船兒不動了，的確不動了，我們不要慌，你們看啊！那邊最遠最遠的地方，好像有一綫燈塔之光，也許這裏沒有礁……。」一言未了，黎芬指着東方說：「你們不必辯論了，不久一定天要亮了，看呀！那邊不是有一綫亮光嗎？而且這光不像螢光般的燈塔之光，……」惠芬打趣地說：「這裏一定是陸地了，……船兒說不定給岸邊的泥土膠住了。」玉琴正色道：「大家沒瞧見那邊有一輪旭日嗎？……不是由紫而紅，紅而白，不久太陽有光芒出來了，海上日出的量緻，還是生平第一遭吧！志高第一個走到船頭上，那時眞的日光多了，太陽也上升，他一看船身，眞的給岸旁的泥士膠住了，很快活地兩足用力一蹬，突的跳到岸石上，接着十幾個靑年男女陸續跳上了岸，在岸上唱着一支「勝利」之歌，不但響亮，而且雄壯，他們的理想，已經實現了，「自由」也兌現了，你想：他們是何等的愉快啊！</p>
<p>這個小島，便呌「自由島」</p>
<h3 id="c73">從伊娃白朗的日記說起 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— 施濟美</p>
<p>安道夫希特勒，這脆秘莫測的怪人，人們以爲他將是個永遠的獨身者，誰知他在自殺之前忽然結婚了。那個名呌伊娃白朗的新娘說：「和希特勒同死，有無上的光榮。」</p>
<p>如果這記載是確實的話，我們丟開政治的立塲不談，對於道極富戲劇性的「烈士殉國，烈女殉夫」的塲面，頗覺感人甚深，而願寄以一些同情；尤其像伊娃白朗這女人，她甘心將寶貴的生命完全獻給一個走到末路的人，姑不論是一個何等樣的人，然而也够偉大了。似乎全德意志，甚至全世界的女人只有她最懂得眞正的愛情。因此在沒有理智過份情感的心理上，簡直會聯想起古中國時代那一雙處在四面楚歌聲中的英雄美人，項羽和他的處兮」。</p>
<p>然而，眞的是這樣嗎？</p>
<p>我們在另一天的報紙上讀到了又一個消息，美國的情報員發現希特勒的情婦所寫的日記，那日記是一九三五年寫的，那情婦就是伊娃白朗——一九四五年才和他結婚的那個新娘。</p>
<p>於是，一切戲劇性的感人情緒全因此而喪失了；我們只覺得希特勒是一個無可否認的怪人，臨死他還記得留下一個驚人的安排，給後世以新奇。</p>
<p>日讀伊娃的日記，其中有一段：「風和日麗，天氣好。我——德國與世界最大要人的夫人，却要在家枯坐，倚窗望天……」</p>
<p>何等惆悵而又何等怨鬱的寥寥數語？就這寥寥數語寫出了多少數不淸的綺恨與羅愁，伊娃白朗不是作家，但是她把自己體騐到的情緒和滋味，寫得比什麼都眞。聰明的占中國的詩人，也曾用「驀見陌頭楊柳色，悔敎夫婿覓封侯」的詢句描摹過，雖然作者並不是女人。</p>
<p>在我們現實生活的周遭，有許多許多的華麗貴婦，她們儀態萬方，她們珠光寶氣，她們金校玉葉，她們……然而，這一切表面的豪華與富麗生活她們是否快樂和滿足？那金色的帳幕後有沒有眼淚，怨言，和緊蹙的柳葉眉？</p>
<p>我想起伊娃白朗，以及許多許多像她一樣的女人，不禁憶起一句話：「女人用靑春和美麗增添了男人的光榮，而她的光榮，却只是男人的愛寵。」</p>
<p>我不知道這些話是對與錯，但是旣然想起了，不妨寫下來，獻給新婚的瑪蘿，她的丈夫是一個善良的好靑年，一個旣不聞名於世，又無廣大財富的工程師；我祝他們永遠的幸福！</p>

<p>— 趙淸閣</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>墨太太一夜都沒睡好，肚子接二連三的陣陣疼個不休。這會子剛有些朦朧了，又被墨老爺給吵醒，禁不住使勁兒踢了他一脚。</p>
<p>「你是在幹嗎呀？這麼大歲數啦，還像小孩子似的睡不安神。」</p>
<p>「什麼？你，你在說什麼？」</p>
<p>「我問你是在作什麼夢？人家剛想閉一會兒眼睛，你就大呼，小呌的。」</p>
<p>墨太太越說越上火，要不是身上不方便，恨不得爬起來按住他揍兩拳頭才出氣。</p>
<p>「我是在作夢？你說我是在作夢？」</p>
<p>墨老爺有些淸醒了，他睜開了眼緒，向週圍看了看，原來是躺在牀上。再用手摸了摸自己的身體，並沒有陷在汚泥裏，而是緊緊裏在一條軟軟的絲棉彼子裏。於是，他愉快地吁了一口氣。</p>
<p>「你不是作夢，就是遊地獄去啦！不然，怎麼會大淸早起嚷着「打鬼，打鬼」呢？」墨太太說罷，狠狠地翻了一個身。墨老爺這才明白，爲了自己剛才作夢，擾亂了太太，所以太太如今發脾氣了。</p>
<p>「是的。我剛孝作了一個怪夢！」墨老爺低聲下氣地向墨太太承認了。</p>
<p>這時，遠近的雄鷄「喔喔」報曉，墨老爺輕輕撩起帳門，向窗子瞟了一限，但見曙日昇起，房間裏已經大亮了。</p>
<p>「啊，天都明啦！」墨老爺放下帳門，自言自語地說。</p>
<p>「我再跟你說一遍：我一夜都沒睡好！聽淸楚了沒有？天明了，你趁早兄給我爬起來。上書房裏去！別緊直跟我嘰哩咕嚕的。」墨太太簡直是在發命令。</p>
<p>「呃！」</p>
<p>墨老爺一邊應着，一邊坐起身來穿衣服。下牀的時候，特別小心地替太太把被子蓋蓋，又掩好了帳門。草草洗了洗臉，然後才悄悄步出房間，走到西廂房的書房去。</p>
<p>墨老爺朗聲讀了一會子詩經，又咳嗽了許久，這才看見家裏人，一個個出現了。第一個走進書房來的是賽鈴——墨老爺膝下僅有的一位公子。</p>
<p>「寳鈴，今兒再把那本「三字經」念一遍，等會兒背給我聽。」</p>
<p>墨老爺說罷，寳鈴「嗯」了一聲，就規規矩矩地去坐到他天天作叻課的桌子前面。</p>
<p>接着，墨盛端了一碗紅棗粥來，這是墨老爺的早點。墨老爺看了看粥，沒說什麼，只深深嘆了口氣。</p>
<p>「老爺，您就遷就着喝兩口呷呷吧！我聽見您先頭咳嗽的利害，所以特地自己去趕着熬了來。唉！視如今，沒的可說啦！什麼燕窩白耳的，貴得呌你不敢問。」</p>
<p>墨盛瞧着墨老爺那分神氣，明白他的意思，所以少不得勸了他兩句。</p>
<p>「我知道！」墨老爺沉　地吐出這意味深長的三個字。</p>
<p>墨盛不便再講什麼，便畢恭舉敬地退了出去。</p>
<p>墨老爺感槪萬端地，喝下那碗紅棗粥。由於墨盛剛才的這一派話；和他臨走時的那種極盡禮貌的一躬；又把墨老爺的往事，勾上了心頭！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Jointly Discussing Plans for Peaceful Nation-Building: Opening Ceremony of the Consultative Conference Successfully Concluded <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] After leading the nation's military and civilians to victory in the War of Resistance against Japan, the National Government, in order to achieve peaceful nation-building and implement constitutional government, convened a Political Consultative Conference of representatives from various parties and prominent social figures to jointly deliberate on national affairs. Amidst the expectations of the people nationwide, the conference opened at 10:00 AM on the 10th in the National Government Auditorium. Chairman Chiang personally presided over the meeting. Members present included Chen Qitian, Chang Naiyi, Yu Jiaju, Wang Yunwu, Shao Lizi, Guo Moruo, Miao Jiaming, Fu Sinian, Zeng Qi, Yang Yongjun, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Shijie, Sun Ke, Zhang Lisheng, Qian Yongming, Chen Lifu, Li Zhuchen, Wang Ruofei, Deng Yingchao, Wu Yuzhang, Ye Jianying, Dong Biwu, Chen Bulei, Hu Lin, Lu Dingyi, Zhang Lan, Shen Junru, Shao Congen, Zhang Dongsun, Zhang Shenfu, Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Liang Shuming, Huang Yanpei, Zhou Enlai, and Zhang Qun, totaling thirty-six people. Mo Dehui and Zhang Junmai, two members, were absent due to not having returned to Chongqing. The venue was arranged simply and neatly. In front of the stage, the members' seating area was in five rows, with seats arranged according to the list published by the government. The press seating area was in four rows, at the rear. When the Chairman arrived, all members stood at attention, and the Chairman smiled and nodded in acknowledgement. Secretary-General Lei Zhen reported the number of attendees, after which the Chairman announced the opening of the meeting, reverently read the Last Will and Testament of the Founding Father of the Republic, and first announced that a method for stopping military conflicts had been agreed upon, and that orders to cease conflict would be issued immediately, to which the meeting hall responded with unanimous applause. He then continued with his opening address, pointing out the purpose of convening the Political Consultative Conference and his opinions on the conference, which were to gather ideas widely and jointly discuss the basic plan for peaceful nation-building and to promote the implementation of constitutional government. He hoped that all members would be sincere and candid, impartial and selfless, far-sighted, and prioritize the nation in all matters. He also wished the conference success. Finally, he announced the government's decision to implement certain measures. After the speech, Zhou Enlai, representative of the Chinese Communist Party, Zeng Qi, representative of the Youth Party, Shen Junru, representative of the Democratic League, and Shao Congen, representative of non-party and non-factional individuals, delivered speeches. (The texts of the speeches will be published tomorrow.) Secretary-General Lei Zhen reported that the meeting would continue at 3:00 PM tomorrow. At 11:30 AM, the Chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Chongqing, 10th] The English name of the Political Consultative Conference is (Political Conference). As the name suggests, it is of a consultative nature. The opening ceremony this morning was extremely simple, but the arrangement of the venue was very solemn. The representatives were seated in the front, followed by special guests and the press. Restrictions on guests were very strict, and the press received special treatment. Foreign reporters who understood Chinese included Varaw, Macaleauy, and Chebykin.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Chairman Chiang's Earnest Address: Hopes for National Unity to Overcome All Difficulties in Pursuit of Stability, Strengthening Power to Accelerate Nation-Building <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] Chairman Chiang attended the Political Consultative Conference on the morning of the 10th and delivered an opening address. Before the address, he first said that he was very pleased to announce to everyone that a method for stopping conflicts had been agreed upon and that orders to cease conflict would be issued immediately. (Applause) He then read the opening address, the full text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>Gentlemen, today marks the opening of the Political Consultative Conference. On behalf of the National Government, I extend a sincere welcome to all of you. At the same time, I would like to take this opportunity to express my personal expectations for the conference. As for the government's policy, I have already explained it in detail in my New Year's Day broadcast address, so I will not repeat it.</p>
<p>More than half of the members present today have participated in previous sessions of the National Political Council. Therefore, I naturally think of the achievements of the National Political Council. The National Political Council is now in its fourth session, and the proportion of elected members has gradually increased. Elected members now account for two-thirds of the total. The National Political Council has made numerous contributions to the country, but the most important one is the unanimous support for the national policy of resistance to the end. Although the members of the National Political Council have different political stances and opinions, their stance on the fundamental plan concerning the safety and survival of the nation and the people has been entirely consistent from beginning to end. This is a major force that has enabled us to persevere in the war of resistance and secure victory. Now that our war of resistance has come to a victorious end, our mission in this world war, like that of other United Nations, is to win victory and to win peace. Winning peace, generally speaking, means to firmly maintain the fruits of victory, establish a world order of peace, and eliminate the root causes of aggression and war forever. For China, in particular, it is especially important to immediately follow the victory of the War of Resistance with a united national effort to overcome all difficulties in order to seek domestic order and stability and to carry out the work of nation-building.</p>
<p>Concentrating Power to Begin Nation-Building</p>
<p>The purpose of convening this conference is to invite representatives from various parties and prominent social figures to jointly deliberate on national affairs. What we want to discuss is the basic plan for the country to transition from wartime to peacetime, from resistance to nation-building, that is, how to concentrate all forces and strengthen all forces to begin the work of nation-building. We have endured eight years of bitter fighting, with those who died sacrificing for the country and those who lived enduring great suffering. Our sole purpose was to ensure the survival of the nation and to remove obstacles to nation-building in order to obtain this good opportunity for revitalization and construction. Now that the War of Resistance has ended victoriously, the work of nation-building should begin immediately. It is universally recognized throughout the country that China must implement the Three Principles of the People. It is also the hope of the world that China must become a unified, democratic, and strong nation. Therefore, on the one hand, we must strive to promote the timely convening of the National Assembly and the early implementation of democratic constitutionalism. At the same time, before the National Assembly is convened, we must gather ideas widely and pool our efforts to eliminate all factors that could hinder unity of will, affect order and stability, and delay revitalization and construction, in order to strengthen our nation-building power and accelerate our nation-building progress. This is the aim of the government in convening this conference, and this is the mission and task of this conference.</p>
<p>Strengthening the Rule of Law to Establish a Constitutional Foundation</p>
<p>In the past, because we were engaged in a life-and-death war of resistance, all arrangements and laws focused on adapting to military requirements. After the end of the War of Resistance, our work should prioritize "post-war recovery first, construction first." Many wartime laws have been gradually abolished or amended. In the future, all political and social arrangements should be brought back to normal as much as possible, and the spirit of the rule of law should be strengthened to establish a constitutional foundation. The gentlemen participating in this conference must feel the same way about this point. If you have any opinions, I hope you will express them as much as possible. The government is willing to consider and adopt them. However, we must pay attention to the real situation of the country and society and ensure that no difficulties or turmoil occur during the transition period, and that the foundation of the country is not shaken, so as to smoothly promote constitutionalism and enable the work of nation-building to proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>People's Demands: Stability, Revival, and Unity</p>
<p>Although this conference is not elected by the people, all of you are enthusiastic about national affairs and concerned about the people's livelihood. You will certainly be able to understand the people's true hopes and wishes and recognize their urgent demands. The Founding Father of the Republic said, "The foundation of a country lies in its people." Therefore, the people's demands must be consistent with the needs of the country. According to my observation, the people's most urgent demands today are for stability, for revival, and for the country's unified progress and prosperity, in order to improve their lives. At a minimum, they also demand that their lives be guaranteed, that they can live and work in peace, and that their freedom is not violated. Of course, the government must be responsible and fulfill its duties to meet the people's wishes, relieve their suffering, and protect their freedom. At the same time, what this conference needs to fully discuss should also be based on these most urgent demands to determine our current national policy. China must realize democracy. This is the consistent goal of our national revolution and the purpose of this arduous War of Resistance. However, before the National Assembly is convened and constitutionalism is implemented, there is no way for the people's true will to be fully expressed. Our responsibility is very heavy. The government convenes this conference with only a sense of responsibility and obligation and has no selfish or self-interested considerations. The government will sincerely accept any decision made by this conference as long as it is beneficial to the country's construction, beneficial to the people's happiness, and helpful to the advancement of democracy. At the same time, on the day the conference begins, I would like to offer the following points:</p>
<p>Sincerity and Candor: Establishing a Democratic Model</p>
<p>First, be sincere and candid and establish a democratic model. This conference is certainly not a conference for various parties to solve their own problems, but a conference for jointly laying the foundation for nation-building. Our views on national affairs and our political positions cannot be absolutely the same, and may even be very different. However, I hope that all of you, under the common understanding of consolidating the foundation of the country, can fully and candidly express your views without any concealment or reservation. We can take this opportunity for heated discussion to discover common ground from different perspectives and to enhance our spirit of cooperation through mutual understanding. Only with candor can we see sincerity, and only by sacrificing prejudices and choosing what is good can we make rational and beneficial resolutions. We should actively advocate what should be advocated, and we should not hesitate to concede what should be conceded. We want to use this as a test of democratic spirit, and we want to use this as the beginning of cultivating a democratic demeanor. We hope that this conference can maintain understanding and harmony throughout, and we do not want any interruptions or setbacks.</p>
<p>Impartiality and Selflessness: Considering the Interests of the Country</p>
<p>Second, be impartial and selfless and consider the interests of the country. Our understanding and concessions have a common goal, which is to prioritize the interests of the nation and the people and to put the gains and losses of parties or individuals second. Before the overall interests of the nation and the people, all prejudices of parties or individuals should be sacrificed and conceded. To make effective resolutions, sometimes withdrawing our proposals is of greater value than insisting on our positions. Only in this way can we see our loyalty to the country, and only in this way can this conference achieve substantial results.</p>
<p>Farsightedness: Facing the Future of the Country</p>
<p>Third, be farsighted and face the future of the country. In the middle of holding the conference, there are three things that everyone should keep in mind: (1) the heroism of the soldiers and civilians who sacrificed during the War of Resistance, (2) the urgency of our compatriots who are displaced and suffering and longing for relief, and (3) the depth of the past suffering of our country and the unpredictability of the safety and well-being of the nation's future. Therefore, this conference is to concentrate power and must not disperse power. It is to create unity and must not destroy unity. It is to support the government and strengthen the government and not to weaken the government. It is to open up the future of nation-building and promote the progress of our country, and it must not allow the country to stagnate in a state of backwardness, or even cause the country to regress. As long as we can recognize these key points, our country can embark on the road of democratic construction and be respected by the friendly countries of the world. Gentlemen, I have full confidence in this conference. I deeply feel that the sincere cooperation of our past National Political Council has won the victory in the War of Resistance. Therefore, I am equally convinced that the achievements of this conference will promote the work of nation-building, maintain the fruits of victory, and win peace. World public opinion and the people's earnest prayers are focused on this Political Consultative Conference. I respectfully pray for the success of this conference with great sincerity. The speech ends here.</p>
<p>Guaranteeing Freedom and Recognizing the Status of Political Parties</p>
<p>The Chairman then announced that he would take this opportunity to announce the matters that the government has decided to implement.</p>
<p>"The Freedom of the People" The people enjoy freedom of person, belief, speech, publication, assembly, and association. Existing laws and regulations will be abolished or amended accordingly. Agencies other than the judiciary and the police shall not arrest, interrogate, or punish the people.</p>
<p>"The Legal Status of Political Parties" All political parties are equal before the law and may conduct public activities within the scope of the law.</p>
<p>"Universal Suffrage" All localities will actively promote local self-government and implement universal suffrage from the bottom up in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>"Release of Political Prisoners" Political prisoners, except for traitors and those who have committed acts that endanger the Republic of China, will be released separately.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Ceasefire Order Issued, Executive Headquarters Established, Inspection Team Organized <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 10th] National Government representative Zhang Qun and Chinese Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai, after consulting Chairman Chiang and Mao Zedong respectively and obtaining their approval, issued the following ceasefire order to all troops:</p>
<p>The National Army's regular army, volunteer army, irregular army, and guerrillas, and the Chinese Communist Army's troops, shall execute the following orders:</p>
<p>(1) Immediately cease all conflicts. (2) Except for certain specific areas, all troop movements within the country shall cease. However, movements for demobilization, reorganization, supply, management, and local security are permitted. (3) Cease destroying or obstructing all lines of communication. All troops shall immediately remove all obstacles to the lines of communication. (4) Immediately establish an Executive Headquarters in Beiping to implement the ceasefire agreement. The headquarters will include three members, one representing the government, one representing the Communist Party, and one representing the United States.</p>
<p>All necessary instructions and orders unanimously agreed upon by the three members will be issued by the Executive Headquarters in the name of the Chairman of the National Government.</p>
<p>We have reached the following oral agreement regarding the above ceasefire order: (1) The ceasefire order does not affect military operations in the Jiangnan region, so that the National Army can continue to implement its troop reorganization plan.

(3) The lines of communication referred to in the ceasefire order include postal communication. (4) The National Army troops moving in accordance with the aforementioned oral agreement must report to the Executive Headquarters daily.</p>
<p>The Executive Headquarters' agreements, recommendations, and directives will only address urgent issues arising from the ceasefire. The sole objective of the United States' participation in the headquarters is to assist the Chinese members in implementing the ceasefire order. The Executive Headquarters will include working groups composed of officers and soldiers to investigate the details on the ground.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] According to military sources, after the government representatives and the Chinese Communist Party representatives agreed on methods for stopping conflicts and restoring communication, Chairman Chiang telegraphed the Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army, all field headquarters, pacification headquarters, war zones, front armies, garrison commanders, guard commanders, army groups, provincial chairmen, and army commanders on the 10th, instructing them to strictly comply.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] Government representatives Zhang Qun, Wang Shijie, and Shao Lizi, and Chinese Communist Party representatives Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, Wang Ruofei, and Ye Jianying, after several discussions and exchanges of views on the issue of stopping military conflicts and restoring communication, reached a unanimous agreement on January 5.

They shall submit and publish reports on the true facts at any time.</p>

<h3 id="e5">Clouds Gradually Dissipating over the Situation in Northeast China: National Army Awaiting Takeover of Shenyang <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Beiping, 9th] Today, it seems difficult for anyone to make a definite prediction about the future of the situation in Northeast China. The Chinese and Soviet military authorities have agreed to hand over the defense of Shenyang on the 15th, but whether this can be realized at that time depends on how the facts evolve. On this day last month, Du Yuming's troops had advanced to Xinmin City, and Shenyang was already within reach. A month has passed, and the situation on the Beining Line is not much different from a month ago. The reason for this is not that they have been obstructed by the Communist army, because their strength is not strong and they can be defeated with one blow. The main reason is still that the diplomatic aspects have not been properly handled, and there may be misunderstandings with the Soviet army. General Du Yuming is using the time to point his sword northward to clarify the situation on the left side of the Beining Line and to control the channel from Inner Mongolia to Northeast China. As for the Soviet troops stationed near the Beining Line, according to the Soviet side, Soviet troops are stationed in Xinmin County and Xinlitun County, but in reality, it is for procurement purposes. Soviet troops are also scattered around Dahushan and Heishan. A Soviet chief of staff contacted our front-line division commander, expressing welcome to the National Army's entry into Shenyang. We also sent senior officials to set up camp. General Du Yuming finally decided not to make an informal takeover for the time being. Whether or not to advance eastward in the future is still awaiting orders from the highest authorities. Currently, General Du Yuming is focusing on the area north of Heishan and east of Fuxin. General Du's next focus seems to be on the summer resort and hunting ground of the past Manchu emperors. The National Army soldiers fighting on the snowy front line are still not fully equipped with winter uniforms. Each army has only received 20,000 half-leather coats, and they have not yet received wool hats. Many soldiers' hands and feet are frostbitten, making it difficult to move. After their most elite partners, the New First Army and the New Sixth Army, arrive, they can be relieved of their most important tasks and rest for a while.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Beiping, 8th] Director Xiong Shihui flew to Jinzhou by special plane this afternoon to inspect. Lieutenant General Gao Ziju, a special commissioner of the Ministry of Military Administration, also flew there on another plane. It is generally believed that the situation in Rehe will have new developments in the short term.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 9th] There was snow and wind here yesterday, and air transportation was hindered. Today it is clear and sunny, and ten more planes arrived, carrying National Army troops. Twenty-nine personnel from the Ministry of Transportation, including Zhang Wei, Zeng Yuming, and Xiao Jingxuan, arrived on one plane at the same time as the National Army troops.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 8th] Director Peng of the camp construction team surveyed Dongda Camp and the Tiexi Industrial Zone this afternoon as sites for the National Army barracks. Mr. Peng and Soviet Garrison Commander Govorov held another meeting at 3:00 PM this afternoon, and the result was satisfactory. The National Army is scheduled to take over the defense of Shenyang, Fushun, Anshan, Liaoyang, and Benxihu on the 15th. As for the date of takeover in Xinmin, it will be decided by Director Du himself. With the National Army's arrival in Shenyang approaching, the two million citizens here are preparing to step up preparations for a comfort conference. In addition to preparing to raise more winter clothes, they will also raise 20 million yuan for the military.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e10">The First Session of the United Nations General Assembly <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>The first session of the United Nations General Assembly opened in London yesterday. Coincidentally, yesterday was the 26th anniversary of the establishment of the League of Nations in Versailles. It is believed that the United Nations General Assembly can accomplish the mission that the League of Nations failed to complete. Since the war to defeat the Axis powers began, military developments have often unfolded simultaneously with political developments. During this period, there were consultations among the leading figures of the Allied nations in Casablanca, Cairo, Tehran, Quebec, and Crimea, as well as international conferences in Bretton Woods, Dumbarton Oaks, and San Francisco. All efforts were focused on how to organize a strong United Nations organization to ensure lasting world peace. After repeated preliminary consultations, the first session of the United Nations General Assembly finally convened in London yesterday. People all over the world, especially the people of Asia and the people of China, who have endured long periods of war, have high expectations for the convening of this historically significant international conference.</p>
<p>The organization of the United Nations is the result of the ardent demands of the world's people after experiencing the painful lessons of this unprecedented war. The people of the United Nations have learned lessons from the war, understanding that peace is indivisible and that "all under heaven are one family." Today, any disruption of peace in one place will inevitably affect other places, and even the entire world's peace. Humanity had already learned painful lessons from the First World War, resulting in the League of Nations, hoping to maintain peace among nations. However, after the First World War, the League of Nations organization suffered from so-called inherent deficiencies, preventing it from exercising its due power, ultimately leading to the outbreak of the Second World War within twenty years. Having suffered the wounds of war, humanity has learned from past mistakes. What is needed is a strong international organization; this desire is reflected in the composition of the United Nations organization.</p>
<p>The United Nations international organization is fundamentally different in nature from past international organizations. First, the United Nations organization is primarily composed of countries that fought against the Axis powers in this war, especially the major countries that fought against the Axis powers. These countries encountered Axis aggression, using blood, flesh, and countless lives to defeat the Axis. They earnestly hope for lasting peace. The United Nations organization was cultivated with the blood of countless people of the United Nations. The exchange of blood gave them a new understanding of international organizations. Second, the current United Nations organization was mainly established under the inspiration of the late President Roosevelt and received active support from the United States. In the war to defeat the Axis, the United States made its greatest efforts. Due to the painful experience of the imperfect international organization after the First World War, the United States made its greatest efforts in the organization of the United Nations, just as it did in the effort to defeat the Axis powers. Such an organization not only bears the mission of maintaining lasting world peace but can also exercise its power to achieve its assigned mission.</p>
<p>The convening of the first session of the United Nations General Assembly in London is to formally create this organization, to use its functions to maintain world peace. It is said that the agenda of this first session, in addition to dealing with the issue of atomic energy control, includes: (1) electing six non-permanent members of the Security Council to cooperate with the five countries of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and France, which hold the most power. The election of non-permanent members should be based on regional distribution; (2) electing the Secretary-General of the United Nations organization; (3) appointing a Military Committee to guide the military quotas that the Security Council should request each country to contribute; (4) the implementation of the trusteeship system; (5) the issue of the permanent headquarters of the United Nations. In addition to these, other issues may naturally be discussed. Judging from these agendas, it can be seen that the main task of this General Assembly is to organize the structure of the United Nations, so that this organization can operate as soon as possible. In how to operate this United Nations organization to exert its power, the United Nations cannot be compared with the League of Nations of the past. The current United Nations organization, with the United States as its main pillar, and the League of Nations' failure to obtain the participation of the United States, reflect a very interesting contrast. The New York Times, when sending the US delegation to the UK to attend the first session of the United Nations, said: "If the United States had joined the League of Nations, and if the member states of the League could have taken small risks to avoid great disasters, and taken decisive measures against aggressor nations, then the League of Nations would have had a better chance of success." Now, the United Nations organization, with the active participation of the United States, and in light of the past failures of the League of Nations, firmly believes that it will be able to take small risks to avoid great disasters in its operation.</p>
<p>At the San Francisco Conference, our delegation proposed that China, in order to promote the United Nations into a strong organization, was prepared to relinquish part of its sovereignty to the United Nations. The proposal was immediately praised unanimously by the American media, who considered it the most meaningful measure to support the United Nations organization. When US representative Eleanor Roosevelt arrived in London, she also declared to reporters: "The atomic bomb has made the people of the world aware of the responsibility of the United Nations organization. Success is not only what we hope for, we must work and hand over everything we have." It can be seen that in order to maximize the effectiveness of the United Nations organization, it is necessary to "hand over everything we have," including some components of national sovereignty. The error of past international organizations was that they placed too much emphasis on the nation and too little on the international organization. This attitude is no longer suitable for an atomic energy era like the present.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the first session of the United Nations General Assembly in London will have important agreements on the organization of the United Nations. Regarding the issue of the permanent headquarters of the United Nations, it is said that a decision will be made to select one of two locations near Boston and New York in the United States. The selection of the headquarters is a meaningful measure. Although Boston is a famous city in American history, and it has world-renowned universities and cultural institutions, we feel that Hyde Park in New York is more suitable for the headquarters of the United Nations than Boston. In the effort to defeat the Axis powers, President Roosevelt made indelible contributions to humanity. Although President Roosevelt did not see the creation of the United Nations organization, the United Nations was indeed organized under the inspiration of President Roosevelt. Now that the United Nations has gathered representatives from fifty-one countries to seek lasting peace for the world, if its headquarters can be located in the hometown where President Roosevelt lived, grew up, rested, and where his tomb is located after his death, the representatives, while engaging in negotiations and discussions, can remember the great achievements of the late President of the United States for mankind, and it is believed that it will generate a subtle effect on the spiritual and mental level, which will be of great benefit to the maintenance of world peace.</p>

<h3 id="e11">First Session of the United Nations General Assembly - British Prime Minister Delivers Opening Address - Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak Elected as President of the Assembly <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 10th] The General Assembly of representatives from fifty-one United Nations officially opened here today. This may be humanity's last attempt to prevent future wars. The opening time was 4:00 PM (midnight Shanghai time), at which time the sound of the meeting bell reverberated throughout the Central Hall near Westminster Abbey. First, British Prime Minister Attlee delivered the opening address, outlining the general issues of the new international organization. One of the representatives from a small country, Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, will be unanimously elected as the President of the First General Assembly, after which the representatives will begin the work of organizing the United Nations, a task that will take four to six weeks to complete. At that time, the meeting will be adjourned until the second half of the year when it will reconvene at the permanent headquarters in the United States. What is striking is that today's gathering is the 26th anniversary of the day when countries attempted to initiate collective action to maintain world security. The representatives of countries gathered in Geneva to organize the League of Nations on January 10, 1920.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] After extensive behind-the-scenes discussions over the past two days, the major representatives attending the United Nations General Assembly were honored with a grand banquet hosted by the British King last night. The main purpose of the informal gathering before the meeting was to ensure the smooth progress of the United Nations General Assembly. As for the topics discussed, nothing has been disclosed to date, but it is generally believed that thorny Soviet issues, the Soviet-Turkish dispute, and the Spanish issue have been raised in the deliberations. The most important issue of the General Assembly is the organization of the Atomic Bomb Control Committee, which is expected to involve heavy discussions. It is heard that Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie was unable to participate in the General Assembly, so the Chinese delegation will be led by Ambassador to the UK Gu Weijun. All news agencies and newspapers have completed extremely detailed arrangements to report the progress of this historic event to the world at any time.</p>
<p>No Disagreement Among Major Powers on Atomic Energy Control</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] As the first General Assembly of the United Nations organization is scheduled to be held here today, representatives are engaged in post-impact preparations and studying the agenda of the General Assembly. At the same time, US Secretary of State Byrnes refuted various rumors of disagreements among the major powers on the most important issue of the atomic bomb. Byrnes said last night: According to the wording of the Moscow resolution, preventive measures will be applied to all stages of any plan proposed by the committee, and any plan proposed by the committee must, of course, be submitted to the governments for approval in accordance with their constitutional requirements. Byrnes also said: There has never been a question of amending the Moscow resolution. The United States is very concerned about the success of the United Nations organization. He will stay here until the meeting is on the road to success. He believes that this meeting of the United Nations organization will be limited to discussing the details of the group.</p>
<p>This General Assembly's Work Emphasizes Organization</p>
<p>According to this agency's diplomatic correspondent, those who expect this meeting to immediately resolve all outstanding world issues will be disappointed. The primary work of the General Assembly is organizational and legislative, in order to enable this organization to be effectively realized and to handle its dual tasks, namely to begin the economic recovery of the world and to prevent peace from being shattered. Simply setting up the necessary institutions is a very heavy task, which may consume all of the representatives' time in the first meeting of the General Assembly. However, the gathering of the world's responsible politicians in London provides an opportunity to engage in many important discussions outside the meeting room of the General Assembly, and the formation of future events in Europe may also be discussed in detail outside the General Assembly. The Deputy Foreign Ministers of the five powers will draft treaties of peace with Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Finland, and Hungary in London. Difficult issues not specifically mentioned in the General Assembly's agenda include matters related to Turkey, Libya, Palestine, Indonesia, and China. And it would be surprising if the issue of the control of Germany does not advance further in London. In addition, the Foreign Ministers of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France will have a good opportunity to discuss the future steps regarding France and Spain. The question of who will lead the French delegation is still awaiting the final decision of General de Gaulle.</p>

<p>[United Press, London, 10th] British King George VI hosted a public banquet at St. James's Palace last night for the chief representatives of all countries attending the United Nations General Assembly, and delivered a solemn speech, stating: "The well-being of all mankind in the world and their descendants is in your hands. You are responsible for laying the foundations of a new world. The most recent war nearly annihilated our world, and we must never repeat it in the future. In the new world, men and women can fully realize the brightness of the future, but the current goal cannot be achieved without effort and sacrifice. Joining the United Nations as a member is a service, not for selfish self-defense, or for the benefit of one country, but to serve the entire national society. This is an obvious characteristic. There is now a driving force that must inspire all actions, so as to deal with all difficulties in a spirit of cooperation, understanding, and goodwill. The tasks currently facing the United Nations are a crusade for world peace, which cannot be completed immediately, nor can it be fully completed unless we can understand, tolerate, and forgive each other."</p>
<h3 id="e13">Relief Work Can Obtain Reasonable Support <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] The first General Assembly of the United Nations is expected to pass new subsidies for the work of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). The British delegation decided to propose collective support for UNRRA at the meeting. Considering the current situation, if cooperation is not strengthened to alleviate the economic pain of the post-war period and solve urgent problems, international political cooperation alone may not be enough to maintain lasting peace. The British delegation's proposal can make the United Nations fully aware of the importance and difficulties of UNRRA, so that the agency can become a powerful tool for international cooperation and reconstruction, backed by the United Nations, so that its funding can be sufficient. After the First World War, most of the credit for relief work was due to Herbert Hoover alone. The relief problems after this war are more serious than before. However, no one has yet advocated reasonable support. The UK's proposal, after its adoption, would allow UNRRA to be directly responsible to the Secretariat of the United Nations organization, ensuring continued funding and facilitating consultations with governments.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] US government officials announced today that twelve countries have accepted the US invitation to attend the International Trade Conference to be held this spring, including China.

<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] Mr. Maverick, an important figure in American business, went to China to investigate the interests of American businesses in the Far East for two months. After just returning, he met with President Truman today and submitted a report. According to Maverick, the negotiations on the Sino-US commercial treaty have been going on for eight months. The US State Department has submitted a draft to China, but neither government has made it public. The Chinese side is incomprehensible regarding the conclusion of the treaty. This kind of attitude should be corrected, so that all industries related to trade with China will know the basis on which they are permitted to operate. The United States should not lend funds until it knows the use of the loans and China's ability to repay them.</p>
<p>Maverick also said that he fully supports the friendly policy towards China, but this friendly policy must be based on post-war relations. China currently has no intention of facilitating the resumption of business by American businesses in China. This unstable situation must be resolved immediately. The number of officials in the US Embassy in China is extremely insufficient and must be greatly expanded and increased. It is difficult to handle relations with China wisely if the State Department does not obtain sufficient information from China.</p>

US military commander Lieutenant General Hodge said: The Soviet Union has agreed to begin negotiations within a week or ten days. At the same time, the fighting among the parties in southern Korea has eased today. Representatives of the four major parties of the left and right wings jointly issued a declaration calling for support for the Moscow Three-Power Resolution to safeguard Korean sovereignty and independence and to assist in the development of democracy.</p>

<p>Heavy Fighting in Sumatra</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] The UK deeply hopes that Indonesians can gain autonomy, but does not hope for their independence, for the following reasons: (1) The British feel that the cultural development on the many islands to which Indonesia belongs is quite uneven, which could lead to various difficulties. (2) It is feared that extremists will seize power and promote the Japanese "Greater East Asia" policy, which may lead to hatred of white people and the danger of spreading to other parts of the Far East. This view is the same as that of some American military leaders.</p>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 10th] According to the Dutch side's report from the East Indian Republican government, fierce battles between the East Indian independence army and the Japanese army have taken place in the Ajiche area of northern Sumatra. The number of incidents in Sumatra has increased compared to before, and the situation seems to be in chaos. Leaders of the Sumatran natives have protested to the British and Danish Allied forces, requesting that the Japanese army be disarmed as soon as possible.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Guwahati, Assam Province, 10th] When Gandhi arrived here from Calcutta to inspect the entire Assam Province, he gave a speech saying: We Indians seem to be about to achieve independence, perhaps it will be realized within a few days. When Gandhi's car stopped at night, he heard large crowds chanting slogans, so he said that freedom consists of more real and determined action than chanting slogans. Last night's situation was terrible. I still hope to live to be 120 years old, and I cannot tolerate this kind of phenomenon for several consecutive days. The Indian people's lack of discipline proves that they have not fully followed the non-violent doctrine I have been promoting for 25 years. However, the people of the country do not need to be discouraged. It is indeed not easy to make 400 million people obey discipline without using violence. Twenty-five years is not enough to carry out this major task. I hope to live to be 125 years old to witness the completion of my doctrine, but if I encounter events like last night again, I am afraid that this fragile old age will end in less than a month.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] British military police officers said yesterday that General von Below, who signed Hitler's last will and testament, has been arrested in Bad Godesberg near Bonn on the Rhine. Von Below had changed his name not far from the headquarters of a British division, so he was not noticed. The arrest was made after a tip-off. The city of Bad Godesberg was where Hitler met with the late British Prime Minister Chamberlain before the signing of the Munich Agreement in 1938.</p>

<p>Shanghai Robbers of Gold Apprehended in Songjiang</p>
<p>On the 5th of this month, an elderly woman was seen by the county detective squad attempting to exchange gold ornaments at a silver shop. Upon investigating the source of the ornaments, it was discovered that a major gang had robbed a large sum from the Lao Wannian Silver Shop in Shanghai and was hiding in the city. The police immediately apprehended two key suspects, Bao Wenyun and Xie Wuquan (who were originally from Songjiang and came from a wealthy family). A significant amount of gold ornaments was recovered. It was also discovered that accomplices were hiding in Shanghai. The squad dispatched officers to Shanghai, seized firearms, and the remaining gang members fled upon hearing the news. They are currently being pursued.</p>

<p>County Government Supervises the Collection of Military Grain</p>
<p>The county received orders to collect 50,000 shi (a unit of dry measure) of military grain, and has been actively proceeding with the task. A Military Grain Collection Committee has been established to oversee the process. However, the provincial grain funds cannot be allocated in full immediately, while the procurement of military grain is urgently needed. Therefore, a method of collection has been proposed, requiring each district to subscribe for and deliver a certain amount to the warehouse. Until the grain funds arrive in the county, temporary grain receipts will be issued to tenant farmers. Once the grain funds arrive, payment will be made upon presentation of the receipts.</p>

<p>Frequent Reports of Robberies on Water and Land</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the year, frequent robberies have been reported here. The most significant cases are: (1) Zhou Junnan's home in Miaojiawan, outside the South Gate, was invaded by three robbers with guns who attempted to rob it.

<h3 id="e21">Date of Japanese General Election to Be Decided by Allied Supreme Commander; Prime Minister Shidehara's Resignation Dependent on the General Election <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 10th] The date of the Japanese general election will be decided by the Allied Supreme Commander. The fact that it has not yet been announced seems to be a major key to resolving the current cabinet crisis. Well-informed Japanese sources stated today that the possibility of the entire cabinet resigning is increasing. The main question is whether Prime Minister Shidehara will be reappointed or replaced by a new person. If the general election is held soon, Shidehara may temporarily retain his cabinet members and then form a political party government after the election. However, if the election is postponed for several months, a new prime minister may have to be appointed. However, no instructions have been given as to when the final decision on when to hold the general election will be made. Influential American sources have expressed the view that purging unqualified candidates and reorganizing political parties are two separate issues. In addition, given the election preparation procedures, it is doubtful that the vote can be held before spring. Japanese sources said that the majority of cabinet members are convinced that a total resignation is necessary. If six or seven cabinet members resign, Shidehara himself will not be able to remain in office. However, it can be agreed in advance that after submitting a total resignation, the Emperor of Japan will reappoint him to form a new cabinet. Many Japanese believe that this will be done before Shidehara returns from his leave, or when he returns to office. Another option is for Shidehara to request the Supreme Commander to temporarily allow the cabinet members with problems to remain in office, or to approve their total resignation and appoint a new prime minister. According to well-informed sources, Shidehara will consult with his close advisors before making a final decision. However, the cabinet is secretly preparing to resign, and will implement it after a decision is made. Political activities are still underway behind the scenes. Foreign Minister Yoshida and other key cabinet members frequently visit the Prime Minister's residence. It is also reported that Yoshida has been in close contact with his father-in-law, former Minister of the Imperial Household Makino, who is deeply trusted by the Emperor of Japan and is a key figure in the current Japanese ruling class. According to news reports, Liberal Party leader Hatoyama declared when hosting reporters that the Shidehara government is incompetent, causing the current social unrest. The Liberal Party should cooperate with the Social Democratic Party to form a new cabinet to remedy the situation, which is the party's responsibility to the country. Although the party considers the current cabinet as a temporary cabinet before the general election, it has to change this attitude as the situation becomes more serious. A spokesperson for the Social Democratic Party also declared at the same time that if they can obtain four seats in the cabinet, they will nominate candidates. Observers believe that the two parties are making this proposal in order to increase representation in the next cabinet. However, it is doubtful whether they have sufficient strength to form a complete cabinet.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Minister of Commerce and Industry Fujiyama Resigned Yesterday Morning <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 10th] Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry Aiichiro Fujiyama resigned this morning because he had previously served as secretary of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and the Political Association of Japan, which falls within the scope of MacArthur's recent directive.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Tokyo, 10th] The Shidehara Cabinet has decided to resign en masse. Interior Minister Horikiri said: "Some members of the Cabinet will resign, and I am one of them." He refused to answer questions about the MacArthur directive, but expressed his gratitude for President Chiang's broadcast regarding the Japanese people. He went to Shidehara's private residence, but because he was ill, he was received by his son, Toko Taro. Foreign Minister Yoshida arrived at that time, and he said that although they wanted to avoid a total resignation, it seemed unavoidable. As for the opinion of the Allied authorities, they believe that whether or not the Shidehara Cabinet resigns en masse should be decided by the current Japanese government.</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 10th] Shidehara's assistant chief medical officer, Miyoshi, said today: "So far, the members of the Shidehara Cabinet have not discussed the issue of a total cabinet resignation." He said: "The cabinet is not scheduled to hold a special meeting today, but it will meet tomorrow." Shidehara has recovered from his illness after two weeks, but according to Miyoshi, he still needs to rest for a few days, so he will probably not be able to return to work as usual this week. "Yomiuri Hochi" said today that Shidehara has given up his plan to reorganize the cabinet and has decided to resign en masse, believing that the Emperor of Japan will order him to reorganize a new cabinet.</p>

<h3 id="e25">Far Eastern Commission Held First Meeting in Tokyo Yesterday; Japanese War Crimes Tribunal Being Organized <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 10th] The Far Eastern Commission held its first meeting here today at MacArthur's headquarters. Representatives from eleven countries and MacArthur's economic and scientific advisor, Major General Marquat, held consultations. The details were not disclosed. The commissioners then had lunch with MacArthur. In the afternoon, they continued to meet with Marquat. Meanwhile, the wartime transport ship "McKinley," carrying the commissioners and their entourage from Honolulu, arrived in Japan and has moved from Yokohama to the Tokyo docks today, where it will serve as the commissioners' headquarters and living quarters during their stay in Japan.</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 10th] Far Eastern Commission Chairman MacMahon announced today that the representatives of the eleven countries will inspect Honshu after today's meeting, from Sendai to Osaka, Kyoto, and Kobe, and will also inspect the Hiroshima atomic bombing area. The commission's stay in Japan is limited, and it is scheduled to return to Washington on the 31st of this month.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 10th] According to reports, the Japanese war crimes tribunal is being organized and is expected to bring former Japanese Prime Minister Tojo and other Japanese war criminals to trial within a month. This tribunal differs significantly from the Nuremberg International Tribunal for trying German war criminals. MacArthur will hold great power in the trial of Japanese war criminals, which has been specifically granted to MacArthur by the U.S. Army and Navy Chiefs of Staff. MacArthur has the right to: (1) appoint prosecutors and judges representing the nine participating countries; (2) review the court's judgment and reduce the sentence, but not increase it. MacArthur has repeatedly cabled Washington, requesting that the trial of Japanese war criminals in Tokyo be conducted entirely by the United States, in order to expedite its conclusion.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Strange Fish Found in Siamese Rivers <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 9th] According to a recent report by the Smithsonian Institution, Siam produces a type of catfish with a stout body that can swallow stones. Stones as large as a human fist have been found in the stomach of a catfish. It seems hard to imagine that catfish really eat stones to satisfy their hunger. It is likely that when they are gnawing on algae, the algae and stones stick together, and they accidentally swallow the stones and then spit them out. Visiting the rivers of Siam is like seeing a marine exhibition, where many strange things can be found. One type of fish can spray insects, causing them to fall into the water and then swallow them. Other fish cannot submerge in the water for too long, or they will drown. There is also a small fish that likes to climb onto the shore and move insects. In addition, there is a type of carp whose nose has developed into a suction tube, allowing it to suck stones in the water with its nose. The catfish that swallows stones can sign a contract with it, each taking what they need. When the catfish eats algae, the carp can suck the stones, so that the catfish doesn't swallow the stones.</p>

<h3 id="e27">President Chiang Discusses with Education Authorities; Punish Students Who Caused Trouble at National Provisional University; Eight People Detained After Investigation by the Capital District Attorney's Office <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 10th] The stern stance of Hang Liwu, Vice Minister of Education, on handling the student unrest at the National Provisional University (Lin Da) has generated a good impression among intellectuals in the capital. Fourteen students, including Yu Boqing, who caused trouble, have been expelled by order of the Ministry of Education. The faculty and staff who resigned jointly due to the student unrest have all been retained. The Ministry of Education's decisive adoption of such strict measures for the Lin Da student unrest should be the starting point for reversing the academic atmosphere. After the order to expel the students who caused trouble was issued, the education authorities declared with certainty that if the students in that class were to resist guidance or disobey the rules again in the future, they would not hesitate to dissolve the entire class.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 10th Urgent Dispatch] President Chiang was very angry when he heard that a small number of students at National Provisional University were causing trouble and insulting teachers for no reason. He has instructed the education authorities to punish the students who caused trouble according to the law in order to correct the academic atmosphere. He instructed them to properly comfort the students in that class who were polite, law-abiding, and diligent in their studies, and to examine the students' actual needs in life and improve them appropriately.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 10th Urgent Dispatch] The Capital District Court Prosecutor's Office, on the grounds that class advisor Wang Shulin was injured in the violence, which involved a criminal offense, specially summoned fourteen students, including Yu Boqing, to the court for questioning on the morning of the 10th. On that day, nine people, including Yu Boqing, Sun Di, Li Shutang, Yao Dajun, Ding Jincheng, Ouyang Zhen, Yang Shihou, Yan Jiqing, and Sheng Chuanxian, arrived. Five others did not arrive, one of whom was said to have secretly gone to Shanghai. When the court opened, all the students gathered at the court, requesting to attend the hearing. The court did not allow attendance because it was an investigation court, so the students gathered in the court's main hall. The interrogation court began the interrogation at 9:30 a.m., using two people as a group. The interrogation was completed at 12:30 p.m., and eight people were detained in court, with only one person released on bail.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing News] The president of Jinling University is currently planning the reopening of the university in Nanjing. Because the school buildings have been borrowed by cram schools, the cram schools are shortening the originally planned one-year cram period to the summer in order to let the universities reopen. The pre-university program at National Provisional University has a similar situation. It can also be completed by the summer, and the building will be returned to National Central University for classes to resume. In addition, the National Conservatory of Music has established a preparatory office for reopening on Guofu Road and plans to reopen. (An)</p>

<p>[Dahua News Agency Xinghua News] Shi Jiyan, the director of the Feng Hua Xikou Wuling School, which was founded by President Chiang, went to Xikou under the order of President Chiang to prepare for the restoration of the school. He arrived at the end of last year. After inspecting the school, he believed that the damage was too great, and it would not be easy to restore it to its original appearance. He must ask President Chiang for instructions in person, so he recently left Xikou, passed through Ningbo, transferred to Shanghai, and flew to Chongqing. According to Zhu Kongrong, who came with Shi Jiyan, the repairs to the school buildings can begin after the instructions are received. As for the school affairs, in addition to actively enriching the elementary school department and temporarily setting up remedial classes for the middle school department, it is planned to add industrial and commercial departments in the future if conditions permit.</p>

<p>The Tongzhou Normal School was established by Zhang Jian of Nantong. During the national crisis, it suffered significant damage. Recently, alumni of the school residing in Shanghai planned to organize the Shanghai branch of the Tongzhou Normal School Alumni Association to assist in the school's restoration. Zhang Jingli, Tang Yishan, Song Zijing, and eight others were elected as standing committee members. A dinner and general membership meeting are scheduled for the 13th of this month at the Gongdelin vegetarian restaurant.</p>
<p>The original school building of the Lixi Cheng Primary School in the Penglai Road area of Nanshi, which was quite grand in scale, was occupied by the enemy and puppet forces during the occupation, resulting in considerable damage. After the victory, it was used as the headquarters of the 23rd Conscription Regiment, preventing its immediate return. It is now learned that the garrison headquarters ordered the relocation of the military police unit from the school building last month. Furthermore, the garrison headquarters convened a meeting of military and police leaders on January 2nd, which resolved to return all school buildings occupied by military and police forces. Therefore, the school is scheduled to hold a general alumni meeting at its current location on Sapose Road at 9:00 AM on the 13th of this month to discuss the arrangements for resuming classes.</p>
<p>The original campus of the University of Shanghai (沪江大學) in Yangshupu was occupied by the enemy and puppet forces when the war broke out. After the victory, it was stationed by the Korean Restoration Army, which has now been ordered to move out. The campus has been taken back by the university authorities. According to President Fan Zhengkang, the campus was severely damaged. The university originally planned to move back and resume classes this spring, but the repairs may not be completed in time, leaving the possibility of returning to the old site for classes this spring in doubt.</p>
<p>All public and private middle schools in Beijing will hold placement tests in the near future to reclassify students based on their performance. Whether or not elementary schools will hold similar tests is still under consideration.</p>
<p>The original location of the Shanghai Municipal Shangwen Primary School was on Xueqian Street in Nanshi. During the war of resistance, it moved to 291 Sapose Road in the former French Concession. After the victory, the original school building was occupied by the police bureau's security brigade and the second district management office of the public works bureau. Despite repeated negotiations, they refused to vacate, preventing the school from resuming classes to this day.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Primary School Physical Education Teachers' Association held its second preparatory meeting at the gymnasium the other day, with Wang Fu of the Education Bureau in attendance to provide guidance. It was decided that the inaugural meeting would be held two weeks after the start of the next semester.</p>

<h3 id="e38">President Song Convenes Meeting with Banking Sector to Discuss New Exchange Rate Principles and Direct Fiscal and Financial Policies <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] President Song's recent return to Shanghai, which has helped to curb the rising prices in the city, has been greatly appreciated by all sectors. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, Mr. Song convened an important meeting with the heads of the financial sector on the second floor of the Bank of China.</p>
<p>Important Meeting</p>
<p>Xu Jiyun of Zhejiang Xingye Bank, Wang Zhixin of Xinhua Bank, Xu Guomao of Jin Cheng Bank, Xu Hanjiao of the Continental Bank, Wu Kejia of Shanghai Bank, Chen Duru of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Shen Shuyu of Guohua Bank, Hu Hui of Zhongnan Bank, Xiao Yanhe of Yanyeh Bank, Zhou Sun of the Four Banks Joint Savings Society, Zhang Zhuyu of Guohuo Bank, Yang Peichang of Juxingcheng Bank, and others arrived at the president's office on the third floor of the Bank of China. In addition to inquiring about the current situation of each bank in detail, he provided detailed instructions on promoting production and construction in the future and on the central government's policies for handling the finances of the recovered areas. At the same time, he also raised the issue of the new exchange rate, which has been delayed for some time, for discussion. It is heard that the principles have been decided. Once Mr. Song returns to Chongqing, they can be announced. As for the rumors that the new exchange rate will adopt a graded system, this is unlikely. The meeting ended at 10:30 AM.</p>
<p>Flying to Beijing this Morning</p>
<p>After the meeting, Mr. Song received Central Committee Member Pan Gongzhan and Jiangsu Supervisor Cheng Zhonghang in his office, and also met with Chen Guoying, the director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' office in Shanghai. Mr. Chen presented a report on the negotiations and handling of the "Berdine" ship's illegal transportation of the French Nazi Kaco Pingno. President Song believed that Mr. Chen's handling of this incident was quite appropriate. At 3:00 PM, he returned to his office to meet with Peng Xuepei and Liu Gongyun to inquire about the handling of enemy and puppet properties in the Shanghai area. After dinner at 6:00 PM, he went to his office to handle important official business. Zhao Zukang, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works, went to pay his respects. It is heard that President Song is scheduled to fly to Beijing this morning, and the staff who came to Shanghai with President Song will also fly to Beijing on the same plane.</p>
<p>Sale of Goods</p>
<p>[United Press] Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen today instructed the Shanghai Enemy Property Handling Committee to sell large quantities of cotton cloth, winter clothing, rice, Taiwanese sugar, and refrigerated fish and meat at low prices in order to suppress prices. Mr. Song ordered the committee to use all means to complete the government's plan to stabilize prices and to suppress the current market prices of various items. He revealed that because of the shortage of goods on the market, the price of coal has risen to US$400 per ton. Measures have now been taken to manage fuel and import Vietnamese coal.</p>
<p>Chen Changtong Speaks</p>
<p>Yesterday, this reporter visited Mr. Chen Changtong, the manager of the Foreign Exchange Department of the Bank of China. According to his discussion, the government has conducted thorough discussions on the foreign exchange issue and has solicited opinions widely. It is now at the stage of announcement, and it is expected that it can be decided and announced after President Song returns to Chongqing. Mr. Chen went on to say that the setting of the new exchange rate will be based on commodity prices. The reason for the delay in its announcement is that commodity prices vary too widely in different places. Commodity prices are now tending to stabilize, so it is expected that the announcement of the new exchange rate is just around the corner. Mr. Chen has consulted with Chinese and foreign business people for their opinions. Importers and exporters do not think that the current natural exchange rate is too high or too low. Mr. Chen denied the rumors that the new exchange rate will be divided into several grades, saying that a simple and uniform foreign exchange rate is better to prevent abuses. However, luxury goods, etc., will be restricted. According to Mr. Chen, raising tariffs is the best way to restrict foreign exchange. The government's foreign exchange policy is to encourage exports, so as to balance our international balance of payments. Mr. Chen also said that fluctuating exchange rates make it easy for merchants to take risks, and commodity prices will also fluctuate, affecting people's livelihoods. According to the Bretton Woods Agreement, each country's adjustment of exchange rates is limited to within 10%. If this limit is exceeded, it must be decided by an international conference. Therefore, after our foreign exchange rate is announced, it will reverse the past practice of daily quotations and strive to achieve long-term stability.</p>

<p>After Shali was arrested, his key accomplice, the Annamese Nguyen Van Huong, spread various rumors that were detrimental to our country and incited people's hearts, attempting to carry out his conspiracy. He used to collude with Shali, bully the Chinese, and was also an unscrupulous person. He also served as the personal secretary of Hua Bu'er, the former French Concession Police Superintendent who had committed suicide for fear of punishment. The Investigation Division of the Garrison Headquarters, on suspicion that Nguyen was a war criminal and that he wantonly spread rumors, sent military police to arrest Nguyen at 275 Masnan Road yesterday afternoon and sent him to the Military Law Office for questioning.

<h3 id="e41">National Assembly Representatives in Shanghai Issue Statement Defending Civil Rights <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] National Assembly representatives in Shanghai, Xi Yushu, Qin Liankui, He Yuanming, Zhou Xuexiang, Ding Zhongying, and others jointly issued an opinion defending civil rights, stating: "Since the promulgation of the Provisional Constitution, the government has returned power to the people, fulfilling its promises. Last year, the government clearly ordered the convening of the National Assembly on May 5th of this year. The War of Resistance has ended, and the drafting of the constitution is underway. By following the law and keeping faith, the nation will be built. The National Assembly representatives in Shanghai, recognizing that the foundation of law and trust has been established, hope to contribute to the national interest and fulfill their mission by working hard to prepare for the constitution. They do not wish to add any other complications. However, constitutional government is based on the rule of law. If the rule of law is rejected first, what constitutional government can there be? Now, the government has invited dozens of representatives from various parties and factions, as well as several non-partisan figures, to form a political consultative conference. Its meaning is to reconcile the various factions, and its power is not to relinquish major policies. However, it is heard that some people intend to use the opportunity of consultation to attempt to re-elect National Assembly representatives, thereby delaying the return of power and seeking to divide power for their own convenience. How can this be what the people of the whole country hope for? We cannot remain silent. The Provisional Constitution has been in effect for fifteen years, but due to foreign troubles, its promises have not been fulfilled. However, the exercise of the power of governance, which legally represents the National Assembly, is still clearly stated in the Provisional Constitution and has not been diminished. Now that the National Assembly has been scheduled to convene, there is a legitimate way to return power. If we stop halfway and unite to divide power, we will be violating the law, breaking faith, and seizing civil rights. What is the rule of law? What is democracy? We, as representatives of the people, will never recognize its legal effect. Before the start of the consultation, we issue this statement, reporting to the government and the public, let us all uphold the rights of the people."</p>
<h3 id="e42">The Stock Exchange is Preparing to Resume Business; the Public Exchange of the Former Shanghai Stock Exchange has Lost its Basis for Existence <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The other day, the North China Daily News carried a message that foreign businessmen hoped that the British Public Exchange would resume business as soon as possible. This reporter made a special visit to a well-known banker in this port for this matter, and he was kind enough to express his opinion, stating that according to the laws of our government, only one stock exchange is allowed to be established in each region. The cancellation of the former Shanghai Commodity and Securities Exchange was based on this principle. The British Public Exchange was originally established based on extraterritoriality, and now that extraterritoriality has been abolished, the exchange has lost its basis for existence. It is now heard that the Chinese Stock Exchange is actively preparing to resume business, and Mr. Du Yuesheng is in charge of it. Mr. Du is a leader in the industrial and commercial circles and currently serves as the chairman of the China General Chamber of Commerce, and he is very familiar with Shanghai's industrial finance. Now that he is in charge of this matter, he will certainly be able to do it well. Our country is now trying to attract foreign investment and engage in construction. Friendly countries should be able to support this move to facilitate foreign investment. In my personal opinion, anyone with relevant experience and qualifications can participate, such as domestic foreign banks joining the unified method of the Silver Industry Exchange. As for the listing of stocks of Chinese and foreign companies, as long as they comply with our country's laws, they should not be divided into different regions and should have equal opportunities. It is best to have financial and industrial organizations to form a credit investigation agency to jointly participate in the review, and the content of each company should be investigated in detail for the reference of investors. It is heard that the institute has now hired experienced experts to plan carefully according to the systems of the British and American exchanges. When preparations are complete, it can be officially resumed.</p>

<p>Li Ze's Trial Scene</p>
<h3 id="e58">Criminal Court Transfers to Prosecutor's Office Li Ze Case Investigated Again Yesterday Employee Representatives Submit Evidence and Make Pledges <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The sensational Li Ze case, originally scheduled by the High Court to be tried at 9:40 AM yesterday in the Special Criminal Court at Ti Jian Bridge. Before 9:30 AM, Li Ze's wife and younger brother arrived at the court to listen in, and reporters from various newspapers also arrived in droves, reaching seventy or eighty people. In the piercing cold wind, they waited until 9:30 AM, but still no news of the trial opening was heard. At this time, Chen Tingrui, the defense lawyer hired by Li Ze, also arrived and asked the bailiffs, who replied that there were no cases being tried today. However, everyone's summons clearly stated 9:40 AM on the 10th.</p>
<p>Re-investigation Changes to Prosecutor's Court</p>
<p>Later, a staff member of the court revealed: For the sake of prudence, the case has been sent to the High Prosecutor's Office for re-investigation, and then a decision will be made as to whether to file a public prosecution. At this moment, Li Ze was brought from the prison to the office by bailiffs, head held high, but his face was haggard and his temples were covered in white hair. The buttons on his blue serge robe were not fastened. Soon after, Prosecutor Dai Yunduo arrived in court and announced: This case has been transferred by the High Court to this office for re-investigation. During the investigation period, listening in is not allowed according to law. The bailiffs drove the crowd out of the court, causing a great uproar. The crowd questioned the prosecutor, who explained in detail that witnesses who had received summonses could still enter the court to confront Li Ze in turn. Only then did the crowd leave the court.</p>
<p>Former Positions Claimed to be Involuntary</p>
<p>Li Ze was the first to be summoned and questioned for about half an hour. Li admitted to the two false positions of director of the "Business Coordination Council" and the "Sixteen Kinds of Commodity Evaluation Committee," but claimed that he was forced by the environment and not voluntary. Subsequently, employee representatives Han Wucheng, Shu Yueqiao, Yao Zhuoren, Ye Qiubin, and others were summoned to court to confront Li Ze. Han and others submitted evidence to prove that Li Ze had indeed held false positions. The prosecutor ordered the four to make pledges, stating that if they were accomplices in false accusations, they would willingly accept punishment, the penalty being seven years of imprisonment. Subsequently, Huang Zhenguang, a senior employee of the New New Company, and Han Zhiming and Zhiyuan from the Sen Da Iron Factory were summoned to court with the account books for September of the 33rd year to be verified. According to Han and others, more than a hundred water crafts were purchased by the Sen Da Iron Factory from the New New Company, for a total price of 2,074,000 in counterfeit currency. Fifty million was paid the first time, sixty million the second time, and the full amount was paid the third time. All were checks from the Shanghai Xingye Bank. It has been found that the bank has been ordered by the Ministry of Finance to suspend operations and liquidate, so it must wait until the bank's transaction records are reviewed before it can be proven. The trial ended at 1:20 PM, taking two and a half hours. At 5:00 PM yesterday, ten employee representatives from the New New Company, including Han Wucheng, received summonses from the Inspection Office of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, ordering them to go to the headquarters this morning at 10:00 AM to await questioning, but Shu Yueqiao was not summoned, nor was the case being investigated specified.</p>
<p>Garrison Headquarters Also Investigated Yesterday</p>
<p>The Garrison</p>
<p>Headquarters Inspection Office had previously questioned Li Ze by Inspector Bi Gaokui. Yesterday morning, Fang Xuegu, the director of the company's art department, and Liang Gongchen, the director of the cosmetics department, who went to the puppet Manchukuo to participate in the "Exhibition" in the 31st year, were summoned to the Garrison Headquarters for questioning. Inspector Bi personally questioned them, inquiring in detail about their experiences in puppet Manchukuo. According to Fang Xuegu, the puppet Ministry of Industry sent Chen Zhong to purchase a large number of goods from the New New Company to be transported to the Northeast to participate in the so-called "Greater East Asia Exhibition," requesting the company to send personnel to accompany them to sort and arrange them. Because the puppet authorities repeatedly requested, Liang Gongchen and Chen Bosong were sent to go with him. The accompanying persons were Chen Zhong from the puppet Ministry of Industry, a Jin official from the puppet Counselor's Office, a Niu commissioner from the puppet Counselor's Office, and other staff members from the puppet Ministry of Industry, a total of seven people. Inspector Bi asked: In addition to the New New Company, were there any other companies transporting goods to the puppet Manchukuo Exhibition? The answer was: No. According to Liang, the travel and accommodation expenses were all paid by the puppet Ministry of Industry. The company told us to see how the business was there.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Major Investors Shift Focus Gold Prices Gradually Decline New Hong Kong Dollar Notes Show Activity Again <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Red-hot stocks continued to trend downwards yesterday, and those holding goods felt bored, settling their accounts and seeking other outlets. The situation became one-sided, but the process was mediocre, with much fluctuation. After opening at 845,000 in the morning, it gradually declined from 847,000. Although several households took advantage of the low prices to buy in the middle, their strength was limited and it was difficult to see any rise. Major investors followed the trend and, seeing the situation was not good, shifted their focus to foreign stocks and public bonds. The market gradually declined, and by noon it had fallen to around 825,000. The afternoon was the same, and those in the industry were dispirited and trading was sparse. As a result, the close was down 10,000 from the previous day. Gold jewelry was listed at 88,000, silver taels at 700 yuan, and silver dollars at 450 to 460 yuan. The secret discount was still between six and nine cents. The gold market was stagnant, and floating capital tended to public bonds and new Hong Kong dollar notes to seek other developments. If there is no special stimulus, the gold market will be even more deserted.</p>
<p>The US dollar is still difficult to boost due to the sluggish gold market, but the situation is still stable. It initially showed a slight improvement in the morning, but as the gold market deteriorated, it was dragged down. It once fell below 1420 yuan at noon, and then it was slightly pulled up. As a result, it closed down 15 yuan from the previous day. Hong Kong dollar notes were favored by securities firm investors, and floating capital followed, buying new notes. As a result, the new notes rose. The old notes were mediocre due to the lack of speculative atmosphere, while the new notes rose by 5 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Yarn Prices Become More Stable <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market started down and ended strong. Initially, it continued the previous day's weak trend, falling another 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. For example, 20-count Double Horse once fell to 650,000, and 16-count Guangming once fell to 400,000. Then, due to the successive purchases by inland investors and fellow traders, although the transaction volume was not large, the market was enlivened a lot. Each yarn rose by 40,000 to 50,000. Finally, 20-count Double Horse was traded at 700,000, and 16-count Guangming was traded at 440,000 to 450,000. As a result, the market price was similar to the previous day, and people's hearts were no longer as weak as the day before yesterday, but became more stable.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Sales in Various Places Gradually Open Up The Tea Market Continues to be Attractive <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The Ningbo area of Zhejiang is also a rich tea-producing area. According to people in the pharmaceutical industry, when the enemy puppets were entrenched, the people were quite miserable under various oppressions, especially the tea farmers, who suffered the most. Whenever the new tea came on the market, the traffic was blocked, making sales difficult. Although there was no shortage of human consumption in the producing area, the income was ultimately not enough to cover the expenditure. Therefore, people changed to other industries, and some even chopped down tea trees for firewood. Therefore, the tea production is declining day by day. At present, the enemy puppets have surrendered, and the sales in various places are gradually opening up. Recently, Jiangbei, Tianjin and other places have shown a great willingness to accept tea. Unfortunately, the supply of red and green tea in this city has been exhausted for a long time, and the stock has not been replenished, resulting in a shortage of supply and soaring prices. Yesterday, Tong Taixiang sold Huizhou fried green tea, and the price rose to 44,000 yuan per load, a increase of more than 4,000 yuan compared with the previous increase.

<p>The rice and grain investors from Tianjin and Qingdao are very enthusiastic. Early indica rice soared by 700 to 800 yuan, and northern japonica rice also increased by 400 to 500 yuan. Indica rice and glutinous rice both rose by 200 to 300 yuan. Flour is scarce and still firm, but the enthusiasm for investing in Southeast Asia has waned. The oil market was firm in the morning and weak in the afternoon, and the market temporarily lacked glory and disgrace. Soybean cake from Taiwan and Shantou is still being absorbed, rising by another 100 yuan. Soybeans have returned to a small increase of 200 to 300 yuan. The liquor market rose by 500 yuan with the rise in rice prices.</p>

<p>Turmeric was previously very firm due to the scarcity of arrivals and stocks, but it has returned due to slightly sluggish sales. According to a quick report from the producing area of Shangrao yesterday, someone has been collecting turmeric recently, resulting in a production price increase of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. The Shanghai market is relatively stable, with about 50 loads of goods being offered, priced at 18,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Floating Capital Concentrates on Public Bonds Class C Breaks Through Three Levels Stock Market Generally Mediocre <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The public bond market was unusually strong yesterday. Chinese investors and floating capital joined in, but the stage was narrow. Once major investors pulled up the price, retail investors followed suit. Various ideals and rumors abounded. Class C consecutively broke through the major levels of 1,000, 1,100, and 1,200 yuan from the initial price of 970 yuan in the morning. Short sellers were forced to cover urgently, and at noon it soared to a new high of 1,255 yuan, and then slightly pulled back. As a result, compared with the previous close, Class A and B rose by 320 yuan, Class C rose by 200 yuan, Class D rose by 320 yuan, and Class E rose by 280 yuan. Floating capital was widely mobilized to take advantage of the price market, so that miscellaneous brands were much more attractive than Class C and E.</p>
<p>The Chinese stock market fluctuated greatly, but because major investors were concerned with other things, retail investors were unable to boost the price. Although there were many good rebounds in the middle, the chips had become loose, and it was nothing more than major investors pretending to make a show, and that's all. After struggling, the noon close compared with the previous close showed that Yongsha fell by 80 yuan, Meiya fell by 30 yuan, and Sanxiao was slightly down by 1 yuan and 2 yuan. Real estate stocks continued to make progress under the rumor that the property registration of real estate companies could be exempted from taxes.</p>
<p>Because securities firms and paper industry investors continued to be active in foreign stocks, Yisha was the target of public investment, and the market was still vigorous in the first half of the day. However, the overall trend was unfavorable, and those who profited came continuously, so it could not be supported at noon. However, Ye Guang continued to show luster under the favorable rumors. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yisha fell by 150 yuan, Yizao and Paper fell by 50 yuan each, and Huidemeng and Yeguang rose by 150 yuan each. Rubber stocks were mediocre and unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Silk is Weak <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>In the midst of the plunge in yarn and cloth, silk also inevitably followed the trend. Rayon opened weak in the morning, with 120 Tianqiao at 830,000 yuan, and retreated to the 800,000 level at noon. Silk mills bought in at low prices, and the price rebounded, closing at 830,000 yuan in the evening, a small decrease of 20,000 yuan compared with the previous day. The spot of rayon is quite scarce, and the demand exceeds the supply, often low and then high. However, the overall trend is difficult to avoid weakness. The market situation for factory warp is quiet, and the price is stable. The price of silk goods shows a decline. Meiya quilt face was traded at 550,000 yuan, Dachen checkerboard crepe factory's market has not opened, and the market is doing 1,650 yuan, and Minsheng brocade is still on the original market.</p>

<h3 id="e72">The Long March at Sea <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuang Junpeng</p>
<p>The sea is so vast, the sky is so high, the water connects to the sky, the sky connects to the water, the water surges with white waves, and all around is just the connection of water and sky, and not a single piece of land can be seen. Clouds of various colors float in the sky, drifting with the wind. Gulls fly in groups of three or five over the sea, sometimes flying high, rushing into the clouds, and sometimes flying low, skimming the water and dancing.</p>
<p>A sailing boat called "Liberty" is heading south! On board are a dozen young Chinese men and women, who admire freedom, love freedom, and want to use their power to open up freedom, explore freedom, create freedom, cultivate freedom, nurture freedom, ... to establish a "free" "new world" - Utopia. The boat is in the middle of the sea, its sails are raised, its rudder is set, and it is sailing forward, sailing forward, the waves are hitting the hull, suddenly spitting out a white foam, the waves are getting bigger and bigger, and the wind is blowing harder and harder, our little boat is really too small, wandering in the blue waves, the cloth sail seems to be unable to withstand the fierce attack of the wind, several times it is about to capsize or break, although the helmsman changes every day, but they have no sailing experience, and after a few days of fatigue, they are exhausted, as if they can only let nature take its course, and follow the wind forward, they and she are fighting against the wind and waves!</p>
<p>This long march at sea will naturally suffer from wind and huge waves, but the partners on board do not care at all and do not feel afraid at all. In order to "escape reality," they are willing to take the risk of going far away, and are very willing to endure it. They cannot get used to the cruel battlefield, they cannot get used to the disguised paradise, they know that peace is the hypocrite of mankind, they know that war is the ambitious person of mankind, they doubt what is called justice? What is called justice? What is called democracy? What is called freedom? What is called happiness? ... They have firm beliefs, a brave spirit, and everyone is confident: "In the near future, they will sail to the shore of happiness, the land of freedom, - where they can establish Utopia, - a country without money, obviously they have suffered from the persecution and exploitation of money.</p>
<p>They are not only afraid of the wind, not afraid of the waves, but also fight with an indomitable spirit, and continue to move forward! Sometimes they look at the floating clouds in the sky, which change rapidly; sometimes they look at the white gulls on the sea, soaring freely; sometimes they look at the vast blue sea; sometimes they look at the white waves, and sometimes they are in the mood to sing a song of "freedom," "equality," "fraternity," ... accompanied by a harmonica, with ups and downs, how pleasant! They love "freedom" so much that they are afraid it is more "valuable" than their own "lives." Especially when they see the gulls rushing up into the sky and skimming over the sea, they really envy this kind of "free" life.</p>
<p>Night has come, the whole sea is surrounded in darkness, so they can't tell the east, west, north, and south, they only feel a salty breath in their noses, and they only hear the roaring waves in their ears. Although they can say that they have been living at sea for more than ten days, this is the first time they have encountered this kind of experience. Maybe "God" is not willing to "beautify" them, and deliberately "make things difficult" for them! The future is so treacherous, which cannot make them lose heart at all, but increases their courage a hundredfold, and they strive to move forward. In order to strengthen their courage, everyone sang a "Volga Boatmen's Song" in unison, because everyone raised their voices to sing, so it was louder and more energetic than the last time. The wind was also blowing furiously, and unfortunately half of the canvas was blown away by the wind, and they could no longer take advantage of the wind to go. Everyone was quite surprised, but there was nothing they could do. They simply unloaded the lower half of the sail, which would at least make the boat more stable.</p>
<p>It was late at night, the wind was strong and the waves were high, and the boat's body inevitably tilted east and west, letting it move forward in the sea. Mingqiang, the youngest on board, said, "What's wrong! Why is the boat not moving? Could it be that the boat has hit a reef?" The slightly older Ziqiang smiled and said, "Don't be afraid! There are no reefs here, how can it hit a reef?..." Captain Liming said, "The boat is not moving, it really is not moving, let's not panic, look! In the farthest place over there, there seems to be a line of lighthouse light, maybe there are no reefs here..." Before he finished speaking, Lifen pointed to the east and said, "You don't have to argue, it will definitely be dawn soon, look! Isn't there a line of light over there? And this light doesn't look like the light of a firefly lighthouse..." Huifen joked, "This must be land, ... the boat may have been stuck in the mud by the shore." Yuqin said sternly, "Didn't everyone see a round of rising sun over there? ... not from purple to red, red to white, soon the sun will have light coming out, the beauty of sunrise at sea, or the first time in my life! Zhigao was the first to walk to the bow of the boat, and at that time there was really more sunlight, and the sun was also rising. He saw at a glance that the boat's body was really stuck in the mud by the shore. He happily kicked hard with both feet and suddenly jumped onto the shore stone. Then more than a dozen young men and women jumped ashore one after another, singing a "Victory" song on the shore, not only loud, but also majestic. Their ideals have been realized, and "freedom" has also been realized. Think about it: how happy they are!</p>
<p>This small island is called "Freedom Island."</p>
<h3 id="e73">Starting from Eva Braun's Diary <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>Adolf Hitler, this mysterious and unpredictable oddball, was thought to be a lifelong bachelor, but who knew he would suddenly get married before committing suicide? The bride named Eva Braun said, "To die with Hitler is the supreme glory."</p>
<p>If this record is true, leaving aside political positions, we find the dramatically poignant scene of a "martyr dying for his country, a chaste woman dying for her husband" deeply moving and worthy of some sympathy. Especially for a woman like Eva Braun, who willingly dedicated her precious life completely to a man at the end of his road, regardless of what kind of person he was, she was still great. It seems that among all the women in Germany, even the world, only she truly understood genuine love. Therefore, in a psychological state devoid of excessive reason and filled with emotion, one might even recall that pair of heroic figures from ancient China surrounded by the "songs of Chu on all sides," Xiang Yu and his Consort Yu.</p>
<p>However, is that really the case?</p>
<p>We read another piece of news in the newspaper the next day: American intelligence agents discovered the diary written by Hitler's mistress. The diary was written in 1935, and that mistress was Eva Braun—the bride who married him in 1945.</p>
<p>As a result, all dramatic and touching emotions were lost; we only feel that Hitler was an undeniable oddball, who even on his deathbed remembered to leave behind a shocking arrangement to give posterity novelty.</p>
<p>Reading Eva's diary, there is a passage: "The wind is gentle, and the sun is bright, the weather is good. Yet I—the wife of the most important person in Germany and the world—must sit at home withered, leaning on the window, gazing at the sky..."</p>
<p>What melancholy and resentful few words! Just these few words write out countless grievances and sorrows. Eva Braun is not a writer, but she wrote the emotions and flavors she experienced more truthfully than anything else. Clever Chinese poets also used the line, "Suddenly seeing the color of willow branches at the edge of the road, I regret having urged my husband to seek a title," to describe it, although the author was not a woman.</p>
<p>In our real lives, there are many, many glamorous and noble women. They are graceful in every way, adorned with pearls and jewels, golden branches and jade leaves, they... However, are they happy and satisfied with all this superficial luxury and wealth? Are there tears, complaints, and tightly furrowed brows behind that golden curtain?</p>
<p>I think of Eva Braun, and many, many women like her, and I can't help but recall a saying: "Women use youth and beauty to add to the glory of men, but their glory is only the love and favor of men."</p>
<p>I don't know if these words are right or wrong, but since I thought of them, I might as well write them down and dedicate them to the newlywed Marlo. Her husband is a kind and good young man, an engineer who is neither famous in the world nor possesses great wealth; I wish them eternal happiness!</p>
<h3 id="e74">Flying Together (3) <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Mrs. Mo didn't sleep well all night, her stomach aching continuously in waves. She had just drifted off into a hazy sleep when she was awakened by Mr. Mo, and couldn't help but kick him hard.</p>
<p>"What are you doing? You're so old, yet you can't sleep peacefully like a child."</p>
<p>"What? You, what are you saying?"</p>
<p>"I'm asking what you're dreaming about? I just want to close my eyes for a while, and you're shouting and screaming."</p>
<p>Mrs. Mo grew angrier as she spoke. If her body wasn't uncomfortable, she would have liked nothing more than to get up, hold him down, and punch him a few times to vent her anger.</p>
<p>"I was dreaming? You say I was dreaming?"</p>
<p>Mr. Mo became somewhat sober. He opened his eyes and looked around. It turned out he was lying on the bed. He then touched his body with his hand, and he was not stuck in the mud but wrapped tightly in a soft silk cotton quilt. Thus, he happily breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>"If you weren't dreaming, you were visiting hell! Otherwise, why would you be shouting 'fight the ghosts, fight the ghosts' so early in the morning?" Mrs. Mo said before angrily turning over. Mr. Mo then understood that he had disturbed his wife because of his dream, so she was now throwing a tantrum.</p>
<p>"Yes. I just had a strange dream!" Mr. Mo humbly admitted to Mrs. Mo.</p>
<p>At this time, roosters in the distance crowed the dawn. Mr. Mo gently lifted the bed curtain and glanced at the window. He saw that the morning sun was rising, and the room was already bright.</p>
<p>"Ah, it's already dawn!" Mr. Mo said to himself as he lowered the curtain.</p>
<p>"I'll say it again: I didn't sleep well all night! Did you hear clearly? It's dawn, so get up early for me. Go to the study! Don't keep babbling to me." Mrs. Mo was practically giving an order.</p>
<p>"Uh!"</p>
<p>Mr. Mo responded as he sat up and got dressed. When he got out of bed, he was especially careful to cover his wife with the quilt and tucked in the curtain. He hastily washed his face, and then quietly walked out of the room and went to the study in the west wing.</p>
<p>Mr. Mo loudly recited the Book of Poetry for a while, and then coughed for a long time before he saw the family members appear one by one. The first one to walk into the study was Bao Ling—Mr. Mo's only son.</p>
<p>"Bao Ling, recite that 'Three Character Classic' once more today, and recite it to me later."</p>
<p>After Mr. Mo said this, Bao Ling "mm"ed and obediently went to sit at the desk where he did his lessons every day.</p>
<p>Then, Mo Sheng brought a bowl of red date porridge, which was Mr. Mo's breakfast. Mr. Mo looked at the porridge and didn't say anything, only sighed deeply.</p>
<p>"Master, please make do with a few sips! I heard you coughing so badly earlier, so I specially rushed to cook it myself. Alas! Nowadays, there's nothing to say! Bird's nest and white fungus are so expensive that you dare not even ask about them."</p>
<p>Mo Sheng, seeing Mr. Mo's distracted look, understood what he meant, so he couldn't help but persuade him with a few words.</p>
<p>"I know!" Mr. Mo uttered these three meaningful words somberly.</p>
<p>Mo Sheng didn't find it appropriate to say anything more, and he respectfully retreated.</p>
<p>Mr. Mo drank the bowl of red date porridge with all sorts of feelings. Because of Mo Sheng's words just now, and the extremely polite bow he made when he left, Mr. Mo's past was brought to his heart!</p>
<h3 id="e75">Seagull <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>

When the storm comes, and the waves surge as high as mountains, it's even more dangerous! Why bother! We are much more comfortable; under the eaves of people's houses, we build a small nest, marry and have children, peaceful, happy... Safe from wind and rain."</p>
<p>Oh, seagull! Are you smiling bitterly? Yes—to understand the ocean, to understand you, the little sparrow's head and chest are really too small and narrow!</p>
<p>Social Service. This newspaper and Xinwenbao Newspaper and other commercial entities jointly manage student aid. Fundraising is comprehensively planned, and subsidized students receive the same aid as before.</p>
<p>This newspaper's student aid fund has been in operation for nine sessions. In the past, due to the government's relocation during the Anti-Japanese War, the government's influence could not reach most of the needy students in Shanghai, so the responsibility of providing relief could not be fully carried out. The colleagues of this newspaper's student aid fund, based on the innate human duty of mutual assistance, combined social strength and collective effort to handle student aid affairs, directly seeking relief from the pain of youth uprooted and impoverished during the war, and indirectly contributing to the nurturing of talents for society and the country. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, and the sun has shone again, our government authorities have long since completed their return. This student aid movement should be comprehensively planned and uniformly managed. Therefore, this newspaper, Xinwenbao, and the "Shanghai Municipal Education Loan Committee" headed by the Municipal Education Bureau have repeatedly discussed and decided to cooperate. This is truly a new era in the student aid movement. The three parties, as a single entity, cooperate sincerely, and it undoubtedly increases great strength in manpower, material resources, and financial resources. It is hoped that people from all walks of life and readers will maintain their past enthusiasm, cooperate even more, and enthusiastically donate, so that funding will be sufficient and our student aid effectiveness can be brought into full play. The country and society are deeply reliant on this! As for the students who received aid in the previous session from Shen Bao and Xinwenbao, we will do our best to seek relief together. We hope that you students will bravely forge ahead and complete the mission of hard work!</p>
<p>Letter from a Reader in Changshu</p>
<h3 id="e76">Please the County Government to Appropriately Reduce Rental Rates <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Editor: We humbly borrow a corner of your esteemed newspaper to appeal to the suffering of our tens of thousands of farmers, hoping for your permission. Now that the enemy has surrendered and the sun has shone again, everyone is jubilant, rejoicing and raising their foreheads to celebrate. At the same time, the National Government has clearly ordered the exemption of land tax in the occupied areas, and the benefits have reached all people, who are grateful and appreciative. However, the farmers in the seventh district of Changshu alone are not receiving such benefits, causing them deep doubt! As this district has public properties such as You Wenbin's education fund, an orphanage, and a charitable ferry, before the 26th year of the Republic [1937], the rental rate per acre was only 1.05 yuan. After deducting surcharges and the land tax that should be paid, the actual rental amount was only a little over 5 jiao. At that time, the price of rice was 9 yuan per shi, which is equivalent to only 5 sheng or so. Now, the public property office has come to this district to collect rent, and after deducting the 25% rent reduction per acre, they are still collecting 1.2 dou of rice, which is the same amount as collected by the enemy puppets in previous years. Upon inspection, the farmers in our seventh district who lease land are different from those in other counties, in that they can freely buy and sell, and the property rights always belong to the farmers. Therefore, they naturally have the right to enjoy the exemption from land tax. It is clear that the rent collection office this year can only collect a portion of the rent interest. Now, they are acting rashly, not knowing on what basis. Can the enemy puppets' past practices be used as a rule for future rent collection? The people in our seventh district, in addition to shouldering 10 million yuan of legal tender in loans from the county government and all the expenses of the district office, already feel exhausted. Amidst the 25% rent reduction and the clear order to exempt land tax, the rental rate collected is actually heavier than in previous years. Are the farmers in our seventh district of Changshu not citizens of the Republic of China, who should not enjoy the national favor of land tax exemption? Or does the local government, facing economic difficulties, want to take from the farmers to make up for them? Survivors of the catastrophe, covered in scars, after experiencing the depths of misery, are now suffering from arbitrary levies. The grief of the small people is unparalleled! We deeply hope that the authorities will show mercy, exempt the land tax that should be paid from the rent, and appropriately reduce the rental rate, so that the tens of thousands of farmers in our seventh district will be infinitely grateful. Respectfully submitted by the farmers of the seventh district of Changshu County.</p>
<p>Strange Encounter of an Apprentice</p>
<h3 id="e77">Picking up a Piece of Candy, Eating It, Becoming Mute <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Editor: Yesterday morning at around 9:00 a.m., Zhu Yuexiang, an apprentice from our shop, was delivering rice to Fuxu Fang on Hede Road. At the entrance of the alley, he encountered an old man with a short stature and a beard as white as snow, reaching to his abdomen. The old man was holding candy in both hands and met Zhu at the entrance of the alley. At this time, the old man accidentally dropped a piece of candy next to Zhu's feet. Zhu immediately told the old man, "Old man, you dropped your candy!" The old man turned around, looked at him, and said, "It's okay, pick it up and eat it, this candy is very sweet." After saying that, he left the alley. So Zhu picked it up, saw that the candy was lovely and red, and swallowed it. After eating it, his throat felt slightly painful, but he didn't mention it when he returned to the shop. Who knew that when he got up this morning, he had lost his hearing and could not speak. The shop owner was extremely anxious when he saw this, and after inquiring in detail about what had happened yesterday, he was shocked. Thinking that if children throughout the city were careless, they would be subjected to the evil plans of bad people, we are sending this letter to be published in your esteemed newspaper to warn future generations and to prevent such occurrences early. If a good doctor in Shanghai is able to treat him, we hope that they will come to our shop and relieve Zhu of his lifelong suffering. The merits will be immeasurable!
