<p>短評</p>
<h3>為四項呼籲進一解</h3>
<p>民主同盟的政協代表，黃炎培·梁漱溟·章伯鈞諸氏，昨日在滬招待記者，報吿他們對時局有既項呼籲：（一）請全國同胞一致制止內戰；（二）請國共兩黨勿蹈內戰的過失；（三）督促東北及各地澈底奉行停戰命令；（四）朮開協商會議。一片息事寗人的好意，値得我們欽佩。不過我們　願爲民盟代表諸公進一解。</p>
<p>「內戰」是人人所厭惡，停戰是政府與中共早已頒發的命令，協商又是民盟諸公親身參加的工作，當時彷彿都有協議，那末今天爲什麽還要有勞諸公再來呼籲？我們要問諸公：「內戰」是那一方挑釁的？首先違背停戰命令的是那一方面？在協商會議時，商定東北由國府派員接收，不在軍事調處範圍之內，現在首先不履行協議偏要用兵爭佔長春的是那一方面？此外，布關內各地到處攻襲城市，破壞鐵路的，又是那些部隊？民盟諸公旣然悲天憫人，呼籲和平，不知道對於存心破壞和平的好亂之徒，究竟作什麽感想？諸公敦勸雙方讓步，是否可以保證中央一再讓了步，共黨從此眞能和平？如果不問是非皂白，那麼盜刦之後，是否也要呼籲被刦者和盜匪雙方讓步，纔算公道，纔不愧息事寗人？</p>
<p>算了吧！請民盟諸公不要忘了自己也是國家的主人，自己也是參加協商的分子，好亂之徒根本瞧不起諸公，不把諸公所曾經參與的協議當一回事，諸公不但無如之何，而且依然祗有跟着他們，在他們佔了一些地盤之後再來喊「停戰」！</p>
<p>老實說，單是呼籲決沒有用的，必須有眼睛看淸楚那一方面違背停戰令，再用力量來懲處這些違背停戰令者，才可眞正制止內戰。民盟諸公自問：您們的眼睛何在？您們的力量何在？</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>印度的統一和分裂</h3>
<p>據各方從西姆拉傳來的消息，企圖解決印局之圓桌會議，因爲國大黨及回教聯盟不能成立協議，終於宣吿失敗。英印雙方定今日（十六）發表正式文吿，此文吿將涉及印度獨立問題，大槪英閣訪印代表團已露放棄統治印度之意，故甘地於離西姆拉赴新德里前，敦促印人準備爲向由而奮鬥。又訊，則謂印督魏斐爾在考慮儘早設立臨時政府，在全體人民支持之下，設立制　機構。自從這些消息傳出來之後，印度局勢又爲世人所關心。依據各種跡象，三方面的圓桌會議結束以後，英政府如何企圖打開印度的僵局，另覔解決的途徑，尙有待於英政府的正式公布。但印度局勢之所以難於成立協議，以及今後印度局勢的如何展開，我們誼切隣邦，願一述其觀感。</p>
<p>首先找們要說的，中印雖爲具有歷史友誼的隣邦，但中印兩民族間對彼此現况的了解，着實不够。印度是一個極複雜的地方，我們曉得的實在有限。中國對於印度的認識，和佛敎的傳入結着深綠，若干人士或以爲印度到如今還是個佛國，殊不知行過印度。今日已找不出一個釋迦牟尼的信徒。我們對印度的認識太不够了中印　民族雖同爲亞洲的文明古國，然而這兩民族的發展歷史郤毫不相同。中國是一個具有濃厚歷史感的民族，而印度對於歷史感則可說一點也沒有。中國有二十四史的寳庫，而印度歷史的紀錄，幾乎全仰給於外國，特別是中國。中國是一個地理的單位，早在兩千年前完成政治上的統一，而印度郤自有史以來，一直到現在，迄未統一。目前旣有英領印度，又有法領葡領印度，還有受英國保護的土皇帝。孔雀王朝可以說是純印度人的「大一統」局面，然其勢力，不及於印度的南部。稱古爾帝國的阿克拔大帝，來自印度外的中央亞細亞，致力於印度的統一，然亦賫志以終，宿願不償。從有史以來，從沒有過統一的印度！這是印度人的歷史命運！</p>
<p>自從印度人民有了民族的覺醒，在甘地及尼赫魯等的領導下積極展開民族解放運動以來，印度人即憧憬於一個現代的獨立而統一的印度之建立。這一運動的展開，同時也促起回敎人民的自覺；爲了保衛回敎人民的利益，他們也在「回教聯盟」的旗幟下，建立「巴基斯坦」的呼號下，展開了他們的政治行動？因爲歷史原因的積聚，印度的西北及北部以迄東部的孟加拉阿薩姆諸地，其居民幾乎全部或大部爲回敎人民。他們和印度人（Hindu）雖同在印度，但語言，宗敎，生活習慣的不同，使他們之間判若兩個民族。印度人有極濃的階級觀念，有下賤的不可接觸的階段（Untouchable），而回敎人却無貧富之分，均在同一寺院禮拜。印度人以牛爲神聖不可侵犯，而回敎人民則經常以牛肉爲食物。有此種種不同，故在印回聚居之處，往往因細故而釀成巨變。例如，倘有一回敎人以牛肉擲於印度人聚居之地，印度人以爲褻瀆神明，對於回敎人必將大動干戈；同樣，如一印度人以猪肉擲於回敎人民聚居之處，亦必招致相等的結果。印回人民問仇恨極深，確似不易合作。這次三方會議之失敗，便由於甘地尼赫魯所代表的國大黨主張印度應該在印度人（Hindu）領導之下建立一個統一的印度，而以眞納為代表的回教聯盟則堅主印回分治，回教人民必須建立他們</p>
<p>站在中國國民革命的立塲，我們當然希望能够有個統一的獨立印度出現。但我們若以客觀的態度來檢討一下印度的局勢，英國如果退出印度之後，若使在國大黨所代表的印度人領導之下而建立起一個獨立統一的印度，必將招致占有印度人口三分一以上的回敎人民的反對，而使印度，亞洲，乃至整個世界將趨於不安。印回人民間不同的觀念太深了，任何人都不能同時起領導印回兩部人民的作用。自從孔雀王朝以後的二千年間，印度人民經常被外來的異族所統治；在這二千年間外來人口與外來宗敎及其它的歷史因素，已在印度的西北，北部及東部建立了不可動搖的根基。我們不可忽略了這一點。於此，我們要特別聲明的，即在我國亦有一個數目不在小的回敎人口，但印度的回民問題與中國的回敎人口根本是兩事。信奉回敎的中國人民，他們是中國民族的構成份子，與非回敎的中國人民在歷史文化上完全是一體，這與印度的回民獨立運動是不可同日而語，背景不同，不能視同一律。中國民族是一體，印度却並不如此。</p>
<p>印度的獨立是一種極艱巨的工作。目今英國在工黨執政下，工黨對於印度的政策，向來較邱吉爾所領導的保守黨爲開明。艾德禮所領導的英政府，爲欲促成印度的獨立而派遣赴印內閣團，與國大黨及回敎聯盟進行商談。對於英政府這種明智的舉措，我們自然極感欣慰。如今三方面會議是失敗了，此後英政府將繼續努力，尋求解決途徑，自不待言。一個分裂的印度，當然容易招致未來的危難；但一個統一的印度，又有目前這種現實的阻礙。如何能够調和印回人民各自的願望，使雙方的理想都能得到現實而無損於印度對外的統一，是固有望於雙方領袖的忍讓，尤望於第三者明智的斡旋。一個不安的印度，對於中國的安全，關係匪輕。我們希望三方面的人物能够運用他們的智慧米打開目今的僵局。</p>

<p>〔中央社巴黎十四日電〕德境美軍佔領區副總司令克萊二級上將及政治顧問墨菲，已抵巴黎，參加四國外長會議，關於德國問題之討論，克萊及墨菲，曾參加今晨舉行之外畏會議。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十四日電〕四國外長本日舉行會議，美國務卿貝爾納斯因欲挽救會議不使完全失敗起見，建議在德國問題討論完畢後，立即散會，延至六月十五日再行開會。同時四國外次仍賡續舉行會議，設法消除各項紛歧意見，俾四國外長於下月重開會議時，易於互相妥洽。貝爾納斯幷提出三項建議如下：（一）立即決定召開廿一國和平大會，開會日期可定於七月一日或七月十五日，關於此層如不能獲得協議，則和平大會開會日期，改由四國外長下次會議時決定之；（二）立即修正對義大利停戰協定；（三）對奧地利和約草案，可列於六月十五日外長會議議事日程，屆時應吾討論之其他問題，則由各國外次商定之。英法兩國外長對此各項建議，雖在原則上表示同意，但仍會同蘇聯外長要求從長計一議。本日外長會議央定，將義大利殖民地處理問題，以及義南兩國疆界問題，提付外次會議討論。</p>

<h3>開羅及亞歷山大英軍　七月底前撤退　英埃現正討論完成撤兵期限　運河防務計劃將為棘手問題</h3>
<p>〔路透社開羅十五日電〕此問已接英高級當局命令，囑開羅與亞歷山大之英軍，於七月底以前撤退。同時據權威方面稱，英國估計在埃軍事設備，價値約一萬萬六千萬鎊，意欲讓與埃及，惟埃方則謂此等設備，價値至多祗及其半，的八千萬鎊，此亦修約談判代表所面臨問題之一。開羅及亞歷山大之英軍雖奉令於七月底以前撇退，惟埃及全部之英軍何時可以撤退，猶成問題。埃及認爲撤兵不能遲至一年以後，英方則謂須兩年始能撤畢，若干代表且謂須五年之久。完全撤兵日其爲談判之主要議程，雙方聞已議定由英專家伴同埃及軍事顧問團至各英軍設備視察，以決定合理的完成撤兵期限。其他應行討論之問題尙多，如一旦發生戰爭或有戰爭威脅時，埃及得如何保護英國在埃之利益，以及蘇彝士運河之防務計劃等等，尤以後一問題最感棘手。英國以運河爲帝國生命綫，故應由英國參加佈防，而埃及則認在上次戰爭中埃及保衛之成績殊佳，故不必英人顧慮。埃人意志堅決，決不欲與他國共同防衛埃及。至蘇丹問題，當至會議末期始討論。</p>

<p>海上三老之一</p>
<h3>袁履登昨晨公審　操一口上海化寗波話供稱：　「戶口米」配給無着堅欲辭職　療養院假裝生病始獲「批准」</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕在敵偽期內，曾與聞闌亭·林康侯二人，號稱海上「三老」之袁履登，昨晨八時四十分，由高院蕭羅長　棻開特刑第二庭首次調查。被告延陣霆銳·李寶森·巢紀梅三律師為辯護人，對起訴書所述各點，聲稱與實際情形相反；彼之出任偽職，完全是為人民辦事，絕非通敵。經蕭庭長根據起訴書一一查訊後，宣論改期再訊。昨晨開庭，因事前並未公佈，故到庭旁聽者寥寥；袁之家屬，出庭者亦不多，袁亦未曾要求接見家屬，僅辯護人陳霆銳律師，於退庭後與被告談話三分鐘。</p>
<p>袁為寗波人，年六十八，住貝勒路十六弄四號，原任上海前公共租界華董，淪陷後，仍任工部局華董。三十一年七月，兼任偽上海市商會理事長；九月間，復兼任偽行政院米糧統制委員會主任委員，暨南京偽物資審議會委員，代敵收購米糧。三十二年二月，滬市受我機轟炸，敵寇不安，將中心區分為六大區，實施封鎖政策，被告竟代組織保甲，自任保甲籌備會主席，負責籌備；至六月始行完成任務，交由偽警察署保甲處，從事清查戶口，同年冬，邵逆式軍組織大華銀行，被告充任該行總經理，並兼任偽新國民運動委員會委員等職。勝利後被捕，由　　處</p>
<p>提起公訴　昨晨被告穿身半舊紫銅色小花綢袍，着白襪黑鞋，鼻架黑邊老光眼鏡，雉光頭，髮已白，但態度鎮靜，精神猶佳。答供時，操一口上海化寗波語，常作笑顏。蕭庭長訊問被告年齡籍貫一過，即問有何財產？答稱：所有財產多為股票，已開清單呈交軍統局；至所住房屋，乃係租來。問：「你家還有什麼人？」答：「父母俱亡，有妻一，兒已娶媳，三十三歲，經商，有孫子三人，孫女一人，最大的十五歲，最小的祗有七歲。」袁乃聲稱：檢察官所撰起訴書，與被告行為不合，因彼之</p>
<p>出任偽職　全是為民辦事，絕非通敵。事變前，除其本身事業外，曾與虞治卿合辦上海難民救濟協會，並連任工部局華董達十餘年。太平洋戰爭發生後，所有中西董事均誣蟬聯。卅年上半年，偽政府要改組工部局，華籍董事四人均欲辭職，其中三人去香港，僅彼一人被日人强迫留任。三十一年下半年，英美董事均被禁於集中營內，彼直任至租界收回始止。卅一年七月，由上海各業同業公會呈請偽政府，改組上海市商會，公推彼為理事長。卅三年滿期後，仍被公推聯任，直至去年十一月為止。三十三年九月，偽行政院院長周　佛海，委任為所屬米糧統制會主任委員，彼曾提出</p>
<p>二項條件　（一）提高米糧收買價格，以利農民：（二）保證戶口米之配給。周說，「只要你出來，便不成問題，」遂充任之。該會有副主任二人，委員七八人，統轄：（一）甲區，包括江蘇十二縣，浙江三縣；（二）乙區：蘇北與安徽二地，惟購買米糧，乃由日軍包辦。至於收買價格，均經日軍許可，始行辦理。彼曾將收買價格，從二百元一担，提高到八百二十元，復以物價高漲過劇，戶口米卒不能繼續配給，即堅欲辭職未果。後至虹橋療養院假裝生病，始獲批准。又稱：「我如存心做漢奸，早可以利用職權，發了大財：可是我乃然窮得很，我之採辦米糧，完全是盡義務，一切公費都退還偽府，把它當作救濟難民工作做。」共做了八月，最初三月做得還好，後來</p>
<p>逐漸不行　到最後二月，配給米無着，實在使我很痛心，所以祇好托病辭戰。」同時，又否認曾出席三十三年十一月三日之物資審議會，與出任同年十月十三日之米統會聯席會議主席。審判長問：「米統會有日本人嗎？」答：「有日籍委員四五人，均為三菱·三井·大華等日商公司之代表。」問：「卅二年九月十五日，報載　會發表談話，說米統會收買糧食，有煩「友邦恊助，　嗎？」答：「沒有，沒有。」問：「卅二年十月十一日，米糧採辦工會開籌備大會，你又演講？」答：「沒有，沒有。」問：「卅三年五月七日，你到南京去報告採購糧食情形？」答：「我是去辭職的。」問：「你也是國民外交促進委員會的委員？」答：「這是旁通情形，目的仍是為謀地方利益。」問：「你發表的「大東亞」言論很多？」答稱：「我尚有思想，做主席頂多說一二分鐘話，從未發表</p>
<p>長篇言論　報上所載，都是他人杜撰，當時又無法更疋。」問：「當時離滬的聞人很多，你為什麼要留在上海？」答：「我自己是為維持朋友，親戚及慈善機關，不得不留在上海，但我曾勸奚玉書，徐寄　離滬，杜月笙·吳開先·何德奎都知道我的。」至偽　機運動委員會贊助委員事，彼稱並未到過機場。至此，袁以久立不支，吞人丹數粒，蕭庭長令其旁坐休息三分鐘，又繼續訊問。關於籌組保甲事，供稱：「卅一年二月十四日晚，上海各地發生爆炸，日軍對鎖租界達三分之二，害民極大，故辦理保甲，為有功於民，並非為肅清地下工作人員。」至於三十二年十二月至三十四年七月間，充任邵逆式軍所辦大華銀行總經理，乃因與邵為老世交之故。又偽新國民運動委員會委員職，係掛名　使，未到會，至此蕭庭長遂宜諭改期再訊。</p>

<p>休息五分鐘後，繼續升庭，提訊龍華俘虜集中營管理員湯淺賓吉。因湯犯所提希望調查之二點：（一）非軍人身份：（二）俘虜糧食不屬本人管理，及證明並未殺害俘虜。然因證人無從傳訊，故庭諭再行改期審訊。</p>

<h3>羅存米　多至三百餘萬噸　美英均為聯總訂購　僑胞募款救濟糧荒</h3>
<p>秦稱遠東糧倉之暹羅，自一九三四至一九三八五年間，暹米出口數量，平均每年爲一，五四六，一二四噸，自一九三九年歐戰爆發，一九四于年日軍在　登陸佔領以後，至一九四五年，在此五年之內，因歐亞戰爭激烈，國際交通阻粳，暹米鮮有出口，而逐年積存之米，據非正式統計，總額當有七百五十萬噸，日軍陷暹時期，由日軍私自運出者，五年之內，總約二百餘萬噸，一九四一年，暹羅國內中部區域大水泛濫，及今年之春旱，兩者損失約在一百萬噸以上，而暹米本年輸出量，按其積存估計，當不下三百五十萬噸，當暹境陷敵時，鐵路公路多遭破壞，至今國內運輸工具與燃料均甚缺乏，雖經聯總不斷接濟補充，但仍不敷應用，各交通幹綫現正用日俘修建因材料缺少，非短時所可補救，因而暹米由內陸遝至海洋，運輸亦爲最大困難，故暹方甚盼聯合國多予交通器材，期早恢復，以便食糧運輸</p>
<p>另悉自英軍控制暹羅後，　政府即頒新令限制米糧，橡膠錫，柚木等四種物資出口，自勝利以後，統計暹政府免費贈英食米已達廿萬噸，以補英軍佔領費用，英並另向暹價購食米一百廿餘萬甽，常前在暹購米老，英美兩國各有單位，均代聯總向暹方官商合營之購米公司訂購，規定購價為每百斤（合我市稱一百廿斤）上米六十五銖（暹幣），次米卅五銖，（每銖合法幣一八五元）聞已購十餘萬噸。</p>
<p>我旅張華僑所組之　羅華僑救濟祖國糧荒委員會理事長鄭午樓氏，乘此次返國出席國大之便，並向我政府當局洽商今後由暹運米返國賑濟事，聞已商訂原則，倘英暹當局予我購運仍多限制，旅暹之三百萬華僑則擬發起節食運動，以剩餘救祖國之糧荒，據鄭氏表示此項辦法，並不影響暹米消耗，當可獲得英暹當局採納，鄭氏又稱，該會自去年成立以後，即擬籌募二千萬銖採購食米，連濟祖國，現已募約一千餘萬銖，購食米七千四百餘噸，自本年三月十五日起，分三批運回祖國，已交粵省賑濟，現仍在繼續勸募中，期募足二千萬銖云。</p>
<h3>生產成本太高　出口業的致命傷　國內物價超過國外　工資利息負擔不輕　提高匯率決非善策</h3>
<p>（本報訊）記者爲明瞭最近本市出口事業實况起見；特趨訪本市進出口商業同業公會理事長張煥章氏，據稱：邇來國內各物生產成本，有增無减，我國出口品中，除機器製品不能與外洋競爭外，即手工業品亦無法開展，揆厥原因，不外：（一）工資太高，據稱；我國工人工作能力，的須三人始抵國外工人一名，惟目前國內工資水準之高，已超過國外，故向以人工低廉著稱於世之我國，竟連此本能之優越條件，亦已落後，遑談其他，（二）國內交通呆　，運費奇昂，無形中增加出口品之成本，（三）利息高翔，暗息常在兩角左右，普通出口品，設在本市擱置一個月，則利息之損失，枝租之附加，共出口成本，月需遞加三成，故出口品與一般物價之趨勢，仍屬向上，而美國最近生絲市塲則日趨下游，出口商無形中腹背受敵，一籌莫展，記者旋詢以有人主張提高現定官價外匯率，是否對出口事業有所帮助，渠稱：提高外匯率，並不能解決當前出口業之苦悶，且因外匯率之一經提高，一般物價勢必追隨於後，結果出口品成本非惟不能因而减低，反將因一般物價高漲，而使成本日益增高，決非善策，張氏且主張中央銀行對黃金供應之價格，應力求穩定，最好勿隨市上落，致反爲投機家所乘，最後渠稱：本市出口業在目前之處境中，實有一無辦法之感，縱使呼籲政府救濟，政府亦將感無從下手，而根本解決。尙在儘全力以减低生產成本，俾使出口品能在國際市塲上競一日之短長，此題而能解決，則其他枝節問題，均不難迎刃而解，張氏旋稱二統計本市進出口業公會會員四五百家，實際從事出口事業者，不足百分之一。其他大部均從事進口業，惟進口品中，類多消費品，彼並舉最近自美國寄到之出口品種類價格單爲例，皮鞋每雙自美金三元四角至五元，呢帽每頂自美金三元至六元，全新羊毛西裝（三件），每套自美金四十五元至五十元，女式春季大衣，每件自美金廿四元至卅四元等等，以上各項價目，尙係零售價格；且各物品質，亦以擇最優美者為準，今設以美國之鞋衣價格而言，在我國尙不足以償工銀，談何原料，而最近因本市各項生產條件之不合理想，美商衛利韓公司已作遷港計，英美烟公司亦擬遷往日本開工，故欲使本市生產條件日益好轉，非先從减低生產成本不爲功。</p>

<h3>躍馬烽煙中的　杜聿明將軍　本報十三日訊　特給記者趙浩生寄自南京</h3>
<p>遙望東北，我懷念着杜聿明將軍。</p>
<p>時間並沒有冲淡我對杜將軍的記憶。遠在半年以前，我在重慶見到杜將軍，那時正當他東北保安司令長官的新　發表，而且準備着在一兩天就要啓程赴任的時候。當時，東北九省二車的主席，市長，以及東北的嘗老長春鐵路的理事劉哲先生都在座。他們在爲遠行的杜將軍祝餞，同時對東北保安問題交換童見。</p>
<p>第一個印印象</p>
<p>杜將軍是在約定時間的前十分鐘到來的，他穿着一身草綠色的呢軍服，給人的第一個印象，就是精幹，結實，生力躉勃。他的身材並不高大，也沒有一般將軍型的肥碩，面部平實，但眉鋒挺勁，眼睛的光彩和嘴角的筋肉，都充分顯示着軍人所特有的緊張。杜將軍的外形，和他的思想，魄力，都是一種具象化的「力」的表現。他的一口純粹的陝西話和大家打着招呼，陜西話聽來是樸實的，家常的，和杜將軍的性格完全相調和。</p>
<p>當時在座的每位東北人士，都對社將軍的被派赴東北表示歡迎和慶幸。</p>
<p>勝利的將軍</p>
<p>于斌主敎，稱杜將軍爲「勝利的將軍」大家在談話中對杜將軍有點貢獻：第一是因爲東北受難最久，而今在全面勝利後，希望杜將軍此去多安撫，少用兵，第二是東北地方，關內人比較生疏，在在都需要熟悉地方情形的人協助安撫工作的推行，所以希望杜將軍麾下，多用東北人。</p>
<p>國軍即祖國</p>
<p>杜將軍表示：他完全以服務的心情到東北去，他希望得到東北人的協助指導，他深感到此行任務的艱苦。談到軍民合作，他說在一個長官看，只要是軍民之間有了糾紛，不論是那方面錯，都應該懲罰軍人。他一再强調的提出，這次國軍到東北去，在對人民的心理上與實際任務上，所負的責任都是極其艱鉅的。東北人民看見國軍，像看到了祖國。國軍應該給在苦難中生活了十四年的東北同胞帶來幸福，帶來安定。杜將軍的話是　懇的，在沒有任何修飾的辭藻中，都極其感人。</p>
<p>新英雄詩篇</p>
<p>年老的人告訴杜將軍東北的風風　氣候，希望他早爲士兵備冬裝。年靑的人，希望杜將軍能在東北寫下一頁可爲萬世傳聲的英雄詩篇。當時的空氣，像家人圍坐，促　傾談，誰也沒有想像到而且不願意想像到東北會演變到目前這種混亂的局面。</p>
<p>社將軍努力</p>
<p>一塲和平安定的美夢變成一塲悲慘的噩夢了。正像記者有一天在重慶聽劉哲老先生談起他到長春的觀感一樣。他說：「困居長春，像站在家門口而不能走進去一，人世間再沒有比這更殘酷的事一情了。」</p>
<p>半年前，杜聿明將軍是帶着東北人的希望和夢想走向東北。今一天社聿明將軍在這種混亂的局面中，正爲千萬人的希望和夢想的實現而奮鬥。遙望東北，我懷念着那躍馬狼煙中的杜聿明將軍。</p>

<h3>鴉片如何禁絕？</h3>
<p>— 祝宗海</p>
<p>鴉片因含有麻　性，任何人一經沾染，沈緬不易自拔。而喁啡高根海洛因等毒物，爲禍之烈，甚於鴉片。我國民政府特於民國卅年二月十九日頒佈禁烟禁毒治罪暫行條例，以爲懲治違犯烟禁毒禁者之特別刑法，考自民國三年施行嗎啡治罪法以後，歷年頒佈禁烟法，嚴禁烈性毒品暫行條例，禁烟治罪暫行條例，禁毒治罪暫行條例，以迄現今適用之禁烟禁毒治罪暫行條例，費時廿餘載，不可謂不久，處刑重則死刑或無期，最輕爲一年以上有期徒刑，不可謂不重。如此嚴刑竣法，禁烟期間已達廿多年之久，今仍不能禁絕，烟民反有增無減，豈眞民不畏死，樂此不疲，抑亦禁烟政策之施行有可反省者布乎？</p>
<p>按鴉片犯罪與普通犯罪不同，普通犯罪，如命盜偸竊等罪犯，國家訂定嚴刑竣法，認眞緝捕，已犯者覊禁獄囚，未犯者望而却步，即足以收刑罰之效果。若鴉片犯則不然，吸炳日久，其量愈增，歷時愈久，　亦愈大。成癮者之身體，受烟毒侵害，即有便閉失眼手頭食慾减少精神萎　等病態發現，若不能滿足其烟癮，則嘔吐流淚流鼻涕心悸等情狀隨之加甚，並有脫癥而死者。故普通罪犯，祗須覊禁獄中，剝奪其自由，感化敎誨，使其生誨悟遷善之心，此爲硏究監獄學者之能事。若鴉片烟犯，徙然　禁獄中，而不予以戒烟藥品，則無異置之死地。故鴉片烟犯，醫療重監禁，勒戒勝於處刑，國家禁烟政策之終極目的，在於已吸烟者戒除烟　，未吸烟者不敢染此　習，用以增張國民之健康。但人皆有惰性，而尤以烟民爲甚，若不加以張火壓力，鮮有肯認受戒烟　苦決心戒烟者。問令烟民肯決心戒烟，若無普國廣大之戒烟醫院與戒烟藥而。仍　望洋興歎，無補實際，　欲設立此廣大之戒烟醫院，則人力財力兩惑困難。上海爲　當集中之地，近日大峯逮捕烟民，監獄有人滿之患，而戒烟醫　之缺乏如故。上海如此，其他各地可知。國家禁烟政策之推行，若進此軌道前進，則再過廿年，恐亦難望禁絕。譬如上海烟民爲十萬人，試問有容納十萬人之監獄乎？旣無容納十萬人之監獄，而不能將此十萬烟民盡納諸獄中，則當然烟民之中，有幸有不幸，有被捕有不被捕。旣被捕矣，監獄至不能容納時，祗得交保釋放，如此一面逮捕，一面釋放，將鴉片犯視同普通罪犯，監禁處刑，不能醫療勒戒。勢必已成癮之烟民，無從戒除，未吸烟之同胞，因見社會上吸烟者尙多，認爲不妨染此惡習，初則玩吸，繼則成癮、如之何能收禁絕之效果？故鄙人主張以刑事政策補助禁烟政策，擬定實施方案如下：</p>
<p>一，已逮捕之烟犯，如確有戒烟次心能負擔戒烟經費者，准予取具殷實妥保，指定醫院限期戒絕。逾期未戒絕者，在法定刑範圍內從重處斷，以儆刁玩。　二，已逮捕之窮苦烟犯，一律交公立戒烟醫院免費勒戒。</p>
<p>三，未被發覺之烟民，如已投人醫院戒烟者，則因其在醫院所服者爲戒烟藥水，而非吸食鴉片，應不予逮捕，使能貫澈其戒烟之次心，待戒絕後出院。此點在法律上可作兩面解釋，（甲）有癮烟犯未於三月底登記，即屬觸犯禁烟禁毒治罪暫行條例，不問其是否進醫院戒烟，應一律予以逮捕。（乙）旣已進院戒烟，其所吸者非鴉片烟而爲戒烟藥水，爲員澈國家禁烟政策，應許其改過自新，不得再加逮捕而妨害其戒烟之善良次心，本人願取後說。</p>
<p>四，烟民所吸之鴉片。何從而來，不外自種烟製烟販運一鴉片及開設烟館等四類人手中取得。若將上述四種烟犯，一律處以重刑，以絕烟毒來源，方能迅速收禁烟之實效。</p>
<p>五，依行政院頒佈之肅清烟毒善後辦法第八條規定，「自治機關社會團體及熱心公益人士共同組織禁烟協曾，輔助辦理宣傳檢舉勒戒救濟等事項。」上海即應組織此禁烟協會，向社會捐募款項，設立普遍廣大的戒烟醫院。或逕向有身份地位有錢的烟民捐募大宗款項。總之，國庫旣不能負擔此鉅大戒烟經費，而政府又抱有次心禁絕烟毒，則吾人不忍坐視大批烟犯，因無戒烟藥品而死於獄中。向烟犯募捐，固不免發生流弊，將受人指摘。然二害相權取其輕，還是多捐幾個錢，使能多有幾個人戒除烟癮的好。</p>
<p>上述各點，鄙人係就市民立塲發表意見，與本人現所充任之公務員職務，不相關聯，合餅聲明。</p>
<h3>杭市民主第一聲　市參議會選舉塲面速寫</h3>
<p>— 本報十二日杭州通訊　特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>繼上海市選舉市參議員之後、枕州市在五月十二日也選舉市參議員。在選舉之前半個月，記者曾訪問過市臨時參議會的負責人問起關於這次選舉市參議員的意見。他說：「杭州自比不得上海，上海够熟烈的，但杭州總是沉着鎭定的。」</p>
<p>競選活動　不夠熱烈</p>
<p>政府公佈各區域及各職業團體候選人共一百十四人，常選的正式和候補市參議員要八十四人，不到兩個人選一個人的程度。但據記者所知：在奔走，交際的也不在少數，不過他們很少公開的對市民演說，或是氣魄較大的發表對市政建設的主張。只是在臨選舉的前兩天，一部份候選人招待一次新聞界。他們特別强調杭州爲什麼不够熱烈的原因，他們說這是代表堅毅與純樸。當時提出他們的主張，是要房屋住，要良好的道路走，要講求衛生，要提倡國貨等等。更有的攻擊另一候選人，並且自己說是以代表某一界的。</p>
<p>候選人招待茶會後，杭州市市長周象賢亦舉行茶會，招待一次。席間說明選舉法情形，有人說：「我們公民證尙未領得。」周氏從西裝袋裏拿出一張身份證，說：「我却已領得了。」市府敎育方面負責人於說明敎育會選舉之後，又說：「我如果投票，必投某某。」</p>
<p>公民證的發給，很少在前幾天就辦好的，我辦公在淸泰路，淸泰路一部份公民證是在選舉前夕才領得，下西大街某宅，戶口已調査登記完竣，而在選舉當天還沒有領着公民證。公民證是以一小方白報紙印刷的。上面一切都印就了，僅寫公民的姓名與住居的年月，發證的年月日等。在杭州市的選舉民意機關代表，表演得最熱烈的還是新聞界。近一週來，報紙上天天鼓吹，為候選人介紹，不過也有報紙稍稍對某某等候選人宣傳得較為偏重一些，也算不着什麽痕跡。選舉前夜，正報社長吳望伋先生發起組織市參議員選舉記者參觀團，下一天借了一輛吉普車，各報館自願前往的可以齊集出發。參加的有東南日報，浙江日報，大同日報和正報。記者亦被邀參加。　先到市農會，職業團體是以初選代表來選舉的，選舉的方法是第一次選一人，須過半數票，次多數一人爲候補，第二次選餘額。而第一次候補者仍可在第二次中選出之。我們到農會，看見很多農民坐在櫈子上聽聆選舉方法的講解。後來又到第一區投票所，在童乘寺，區　選舉是直接普選的，由人民逕往投票，以多數爲當選，次多數爲候補，但在童乘寺看來，不够十分熱烈。從童乘寺出來，我們受驅車南星橋，有見那敵人燒殺過的殘破房屋，又想起了今天人民獲得了主權，眞不勝高興。到投票所，門口貼着「非投票人不准入內」的紙條。裏面發票處，擁着很多來自田間的農胞，有的年齡很輕，有的抱蒲孩子，有的是年已六十開外的老太太，到是夠熱烈的。一位候選人在大聲的講，說：「區長自己要當選，所以公民證都自己親自去發。</p>
<p>車夫茶房　民意代表</p>
<p>我們又到商會，他們早已選好了，什麽人當選也已揭曉了，一個當選候補的人在哈哈大笑，畢竟都是商界的鉅子，所以也很多禮讓。後來，又趕到市總工會，他們也已經選出了，聽說其中有一個茶房，有一個黃包車夫都已當選，這倒是眞正的民意代表。　再上惠興中學，是二區的投票所之一。阮廳長也曾來投過票了，在敎室的角落裏，有一個人在埋頭寫，我過去一看，原來在趕寫「公民證」。又至虹道小學，一個事務員在打瞌睡，投票所主任在說：「投票情形還沒有到飽和點。」</p>
<p>選那一個　選頭一個</p>
<p>我們越過幾條馬路，想到東街路看三區選舉去，問警察，警察不曉得投票事務所這一回事。與「到南星橋問警察選舉在那裏而警察回說不曉得」一樣。結果一個小學生把我們引到了東街路中心小學，我們看見很多婦女在投票，寫票人問要選那一個？婦女們說：「選頭一個」。頭一個是區長的大名。走出小學大門，許多老百姓告訴我們，某某律師在中心小學大門上貼着紅紙條，寫：「今天選舉某某某」，我們恥他平日行為，所以被一一扯掉了</p>
<p>拆往自由職業投票所，也已竣事。律師某某和藥劑師某某某當選正式參議員，新聞記者某某某當選了候備。</p>
<p>繞過湖濱，爬上斷橋，到外西湖左蔣二公祠，上午一位記者吿訴我們說：那裏有一些小紛擾。當我們去時，紛擾已沒有了。聽說周市長也來投過票，那裏用竹竿擱成進出口，以資遵守秩序。早上的紛擾一說是為了發選舉票稍為遲緩所致。一說是有一個人領了廿四張公民證，換了三十五張選舉票，才發生糾紛的。</p>
<p>再繞蘇堤，列凈慈寺附近的投票所，那裏投票的人還踴躍，我們去時，工作人員顯得異當緊張。有一個人去投票，我們問他選那一個。他說「不曉得」。事務員唱名給他聽，唱到「某某某」時特別加重語氣，那個選民也恍悟而選「某某某」了。</p>
<p>知識份子　畢竟不同</p>
<p>從凈慈寺出來，心裏異常感慨，折到湖濱省民敎館看一看敎育會的選舉，那是直接選舉的，處理得井井有條，頗具規模。智識份子到底不同了。</p>
<p>歸途中，我們想這到底是第一次，第一次即使有些錯誤，也應該原諒。不過，我們知道了錯誤，應該立予改正。例如公民證的遲遲發給，和寫票事務員等的不太愼重，這都可作下一次選舉時的殷鑑。　同時，這一次競選的人不够熱烈，儘管候選人誇張杭州是「誠樸鎭定」，但對於自己的權利，政治的興趣，總該提到最高的程度。競選人發表的演說也稍欠煽動性的內容。我們希望競選人愈多愈好，選民也愈多愈好，愈多則表演民主的認識愈高。如果我們爲了選舉可以「平安」過去，而深恐熱烈了會惹事，那是不大對勁的。</p>
<p>聽說這一回有幾位飽學之士，就沒有選出來，而且臨參會的副議長之江大學校長李培恩只選得一個候補，這些都是要特別注意的地方。</p>
<h3>疫癘侵襲諸暨</h3>
<p>— 五日諸暨通訊　飛村</p>
<p>此間除了糧食使人恐慌外，疫癘正威脅着人的生命，在這八年大戰以後的局面，人的生侖仍是無保障的。四鄉連續傳來黑色的惡耗，先是黑死病，腦膜炎，接着是天花等等。天花已奪走了不少活潑潑的兒童，連大人也有因此而殞命的。尤其在學校病症的傳染性更大，差不多每一個學校的學生都有「因患天花」而曠課的，某一個保校，五十個學生當中，克有半數染着天花。</p>
<p>報紙上幾乎天天在大喊：「注意疫癘」，可是衛生當局實在太窮困，太負不了責任，救得了這邊，就顧不了那頭，結果是索典百不管。人力顯然已撲滅不了它，在鄕民看起來，大家只好乞靈於神明之前，各鄕正在大事迎神朮庇佑，而一些不務正業的投機份子便大大地從中混水摸魚，借賽會爲名，演戲·聚賭，最後弄得鄉民家窮財盡，而疫神却依然張牙舞爪向人索命。說起來，這是相當悽慘的，爲了賽會，爲了請菩薩庇護，攤派式的捐款普遍地在執行。</p>
<h3>忠烈仕勇　殉國英雄　張自忠將軍</h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>股汝耕在冀東組織傀儡政權的時候，記者正在北平讀書。那時，平津一帶的防守完全由二十九軍宋明軒將軍負責。北平雄偉堅固的城牆旁邊，長滿了荒草的雉堞左右，靜靜的站着二十九軍的勇士們，峭厲的朔風帶着華北平原的黄沙，吹動着他們的單薄的灰布軍衣，吹動着他們背上大刀柄上的紅　。</p>
<p>老百姓覺得安心了一點。雖然王府井大街上多的是蹣跚來往的日本兵，雖然大街小巷多的是高麗棒子們的白面舖，雖然海河上面常常浮着死路不明的尸體——可是，大家心裏記得滿淸楚：二十九軍是古北口，喜峯口的英雄。那些雪亮的刀鋒上，曾經蘸過無數日本兵的血！　然而，情形愈來愈不好。愛國學生一再被捕，「獨立評論」因爲發表了一篇反對華北特殊化的稿子，被當局勒令停刋，那篇文章的作者張奚若敎授被下令逮捕，「打倒日本帝國主義二的口號成爲最危險的禁忌。</p>
<p>祇有秦德純氏，對大家激昂慷慨的說過一句話：「我姓秦的決不賣國！」</p>
<p>別人，都守着令人難堪的械默。</p>
<p>終於，在美麗的蘆溝橋展開了抗戰的序幕！全中國的人民怒吼着抗日，全中國的山岳邱陵發出了驚天動地的回聲：抗日！然而，誰知道呢，張自忠不走！</p>
<p>難道，這位在喜峯口死戰抗日的英雄，都變了心嗎？</p>
<p>在張將軍殉國六週年的今日，回想起當時的想法，眞是慚愧無窮，悔恨無窮！我應當引將主席對張將軍的評語：「不以當世之是非毀譽亂其慮，此古大臣謀國之用心，固非尋常之人所及知，亦非尋常之人所能任！」誰知道呢？那時，張將軍已經留下了遺囑，早準備以身殉國了！</p>
<p>全面抗戰開始，張將軍終於秘密浮海，到達首都。蔣主席是知道他的苦心孤詣的，毅然起用爲五十九軍軍長。二十七年二月，增援淮河戰綫，幾次猛烈反擊，克復據點多處，使敵軍在凶燄正張之際，遭到了第一次挫敗。同年三月，敵軍以最精銳的「鐵騎」坂垣師團猛撲臨沂，準備入合兒莊，侵徐州。張將軍又奉命星夜馳援，一晝夜軍行一百八十里！激戰七畫夜，敵人飛機大砲坦克密集轟擊，但是，張將軍在槍林彈雨之中，還是親自指揮着機關槍衝</p>
<p>第二期抗戰開始時，張將軍是第三十三十團軍總司令兼第五戰區右翼兵團總司令，駐節荆門，永保襄樊，三次完成豫南鄂北之捷，一直到民國二十九年，敵軍不敢西窺。</p>
<p>民國二十九年五月一日，敵軍第三師團，第三十九師團，又臨時配合了兩聯隊，猛烈進犯。張將軍在五月九日貽書副總司令馮治安將軍：「渡河決拼一死，暫離永別不得知。」又傳論各將：「敵來犯，兄即到河東與弟等同犧牲。國家到此地步，除我等爲國家死，別無其他辦法。兄爲國家民族死之決心，海不枯，石不爛，決不半點變更，希諸弟共勉之！」</p>
<p>是抱了這樣的心情，他親自帶了少數的部隊</p>
<p>血雨腥風之中，張將軍祇每天稍爲吃一點蠶豆充飢。</p>
<p>十六日拂曉，敵人愈近了。張將軍已層層被圍。正午，子彈愈爲密集，張將軍左臂已經中了步槍彈，爲了安定軍心，他並不包紥，血，就讓他流着！</p>
<p>他不肯移轉陣地，祇時部屬散開，不要做敵人的射擊目標。二點半，右翼官兵全數犧牲。張將軍悲憤交併，帶了最後剩下的幾個人，竟向右翼衝去！</p>
<p>這是最後一次衝鋒了！張將軍連中機槍傷六處，右胸也洞穿了。他拔出了領袖贈劍自刎，結副官朱增源抱住，然而血流已多，終于不支。在大砲機槍交奏聲中，他嘶聲說「對國家，對民族，對領袖，對良心，都平安！」</p>
<p>就這樣，他用事實表現了他對國家的忠貞，他用熱血寫成了中華民族輝煌的歷史。</p>
<p>張將軍的忠烈仁勇，使敵人都深深感動了。他們把將軍的忠骸以上將禮成殮，全體官兵到塲恭祭。但終于在六天之後，就由我軍三十八師官兵尋到了靈柩，舁歸防地。馮副司令率領全體官兵，郊迎數十里，憑棺慟哭，哀震天地！</p>
<p>靈柩在五月二十八日到重慶。蔣委員長親率全體中樞當局，親迎江干，淚下如雨！</p>
<p>我們的勝利並不是偶然的。從此之後，讓我們永遠在每年五月十六日，張將軍殉國的忌辰，用最虔敬最悲悼的赤忱，來紀念這位叱咤風雲的民族英雄，也讓我們向千千萬萬在抗戰中犧牲了的軍民致敬！鋒！有一次，離開敵人的坦克本祇有百步，他就伏在路邊工事裏，指揮手槍隊，用手溜彈向敵人出擊！戰士們燃燒着長城抗戰時候的熱血，儘管武器不如人家，訓練不如人家，還是前仆後繼，反覆衝擊，終於擊退了頑强的敵軍！</p>
<p>武漢會戰開始，張將軍奉令進出潢川，掩護信陽大軍。這是一支孤軍，情形非常危險，統率部的命令是守五天到七天，但是他親冒矢石，激戰了十一晝夜。連敵人的廣播也承認是遭遇了前所未見的勁敵。　在軍中，張將軍曾打電報給他的令弟自明說：「吾一日不死，必盡我一日殺敵之責。敵一日不去，吾必矢以忠貞，至死而止！」渡河了。</p>
<p>戰綫實在長，張將軍可以抽用的兵力祇有三個團，兩個營。而敵人却增加了飛機二十餘架，重砲十餘門。在細雨瀟瀟之中，展開了血戰。五月十一日那天，反覆肉搏了十幾次！十二日，進佔棗陽，張將軍親臨前綫督師，日軍終于敗退。</p>
<p>十三日起，張將軍奉命轉擊正在南進的敵軍第十三師團，戰綫是方家集南瓜店一帶。但是那時不單將士困　，連糧秣彈藥也漸漸吿罄了。敵人改變了計劃，專門對張將軍進行合圍。飛機集密轟炸，張將軍的部隊已經不足三千人了。</p>

<p>自由談　婦女与家庭特輯</p>
<h3>兒童說謊問題</h3>
<p>— 梵溪</p>
<p>「說謊」顯然與兒童愛誠實的本性互相衝突。爲什麼大多數的兒童，都有說謊的習慣，這在兒童心理學上，佔了很重要的硏究地位。司泰恩（Stern）曾經做過許多試騐，結果都證明說謊不是兒童的本性，而是由於後天實際生活環境的影響。所以要防止兒童說謊，必須先明瞭兒童心理和各種情緒的內心衝動。兒童有時爲了認識事物不正確，和易受暗示，說出了和他思想相反的言詞。假若認爲這是在說謊，那便是最大的錯誤。當一個幼兒不知道虎與豹的區別時他會對他的母親說：「媽媽，在電影中有一隻大虎呢？」其實他所看到的只是一隻豹；或者他會見了一隻小羊而說成了捲毛狗。這樣的事實在幼兒的談話中常常發現。兒童本身並不是在說謊，而是由於他對事情了解的程度太低。沒有正確辯別事物的能力，常常把大形動物都認爲是虎，或平日常常聽到捲毛狗這名詞，便把牠應用到每種小動物的身上。所以兒童的說謊有時候是由這類的事實演進，漸漸成了習慣。並且，兒童想像力活潑，把事實與客觀的想像，揑造在一起，而自己一點也不覺得是受了虛構事實的欺騙。下面是幾個普通兒童說謊的原因，聰明的父母應該隨時加以注意：</p>
<p>（一）利己思想的驅使——利己是人類的天性，兒童在初營社會生活的時候，很想獨佔所有同伴的玩其，所以兒童常常想借說謊來騙得一點利益，或是借着說謊來滿足自己的慾望。</p>
<p>（二）摹倣成年人——兒童的墓倣性最大。四五個月的小孩，便知道怎樣學習成年人所敎的手勢和面部表情。兒童能努力學他祖父生氣的樣子，和祖母吃飯的姿勢。更明顯的是一個嬰兒哭泣，另一個嬰兒也隨之號呌；或看到一個小孩吃生梨，則情願放棄自己手中原有的橘子，而也要吃生梨。所以父母的常常爲了一時的疏忽，而做了兒童說謊的榜樣。例如；避免去見一位客人，而對兒童說：「快去吿訴張伯伯，就說媽媽和爸爸都不在家，好寳寳，聽話。」或是時兒童少說一點年歲，而能得到免費乘車的優待等。這些細微的事實，都能引起兒童說謊的動機；像這樣的事實，簡直是無形中在獎勵說謊。</p>
<p>（三）由於貪得或懶惰——這也是一種自利心的傾向，兒童永遠都希望分到比別人多一點的糖果，所以常常要板着面孔，現出可憐的樣子說：「今天沒吃到一個梨子。」或「四塊糖都被哥哥吃光了，我一點沒吃着。」這種說謊完全爲了多得一點食品。小學校中的兒童，常常爲了功課沒做完，或者不願做掃除工作而說「肚子痛」。</p>
<p>（四）由於恐懼——恐懼是造成兒童說謊的主要原因。大多數父母，常發現兒童有一點錯誤時，便疾聲厲色的去詢問，甚而打罵，這使兒童的自尊心很受影響。小孩爲了自尊起見，常常用說謊來欺騙父母，免去當時的責罰或鞭打。</p>
<p>（五）由於虛榮和狡詐——兒童自尊心頗强，無論何時，都不願意表示出自己的軟弱或無理。低能的兒童，雖然受了同伴的欺侮，而在其他同伴的面前，還是要自誇怎樣英勇和有力。以狡許來說謊，幼小兒童中尙少。兒童的狡詐心，普通在十歲以後，才完全的現露。</p>
<p>怎樣預防說謊？</p>
<p>我們旣然知道說謊的原因，完全是由於後天的環境和習慣所養成，那麽，敎師們和父母們，對於兒童所處的環境必須特別仔細，除了平時多注重品格的陶冶和養成正直與友愛的性格外，還要注意下面這幾件事：</p>
<p>（一）忠誠——無論是敎師或父母，對於兒童的態度必須忠誠，給兒童做誠實的模範，用誠實來抓到兒童的信仰。一舉一動，都要獲得兒童的崇拜與尊敬。</p>
<p>（二）溫和——愛是一切敎育行爲的推動力，所以聰明的敎師，和善良的父母，對待兒童的態度，應永遠保持溫和。雖然在發現兒童有錯誤的時候，也要婉言相勸，不要打駡，因爲威嚇和利誘，都能引起說謊。</p>
<p>（三）公平——對待兒童要絕對的公平，因爲兒童自尊心强，不要呌他們得到不應受的侮辱。更要注意，不要獎勵兒童用狡詐騙來的成功，更不要在許多人面前去批評某個兒童愚笨，或某個兒童聽明。也不應當用懲罰的方法來矯正他的錯誤。這樣不但無益，反而增强了兒童說謊的心。更應當爲兒童佈置下一個誠實的環境，對於誠實的行爲暗中加以獎勵。最要緊的是別使兒童在公衆面前道歉。要以誠實，公平，親愛的態度，使兒童自己懺悔。</p>
<p>上面提出的這幾條，常然不能包括所有敎育的方法，不過，聰明的父母們，若能眞正的去實行，那麽你們的孩子，不會養成說謊的習慣。</p>
<h3>怎樣紀念母親節</h3>
<p>— 耿星</p>
<p>前幾天，我們慶祝母親節時，我曾和幾個知友討論：爲子女的，應該怎樣去紀念它？怎樣紀念纔有意義呢？</p>
<p>我以爲工作，是紀念的最好的方法。</p>
<p>母親，一如那位母親節的創始人賈維斯所說：「受苦多而享福少」。你想吧：從十月懷胎，生產，哺乳以至撫育長大，那一樣不是母親的事，那一時刻不要她的操心？尤其是在中國，社會兒童保育事業還祗在萌芽，家庭中一切設備的不科學化，更値此生活程度日高的今日，在一般中下家庭裏做母親的眞是最辛苦甚至是最痛苦的了，她們僱不起傭人，照顧孩子而外，更要處理家庭中一切的事情，工作的重担壓得她們喘不過氣來，早起晚息，日無寗晷，更談不到甚麼消遣，娛樂了。</p>
<p>於是，由於身體，精神的缺乏休息與調劑，使她們的身體衰弱，靑春很快的消逝。精神上受了身體疲勞甚至病痛的刺激，孩子的煩擾，家庭瑣事的繁忙，以及經濟上的重壓，往往使她們變得憂抑，煩躁，容易發怒；這樣，不但她自身感受痛苦，同時使整個的家庭空氣變得緊張而陰沈，使孩子們的精神上也受到惡劣的影響。</p>
<p>所以，爲子女的，如果年齡已够大，體力已够做一點事情，那末，在讀書的餘暇，盡力帮助母親做一點事，分她一點勞吧！並且盡力做得好，用遊戲的心情去做工作，把工作當作遊戲一樣的高興去做。因爲優美的工作成績，不但使你自己快活，更會使你的母親高興，增加了家庭間融洩的氣氛，使幼小的弟妹們也受到快樂的恩賜。</p>
<p>譬如你把塵埃堆積的房間打掃一淸，灰闇的玻璃窗揩拭一亮，凌亂的什物整理得井然有序，當工作完畢時，你自己對於這眼前煥然一新的量象一定感到無限的舒適和得意，而你的母親也定然要稱讚你的能幹，使她覺得她一生爲你的辛勞並不是徒然，而得到很大的安慰！</p>
<p>我知道，你們都是深受着你們母親的，那末，母親的快樂也該就是你們的快樂。能使你母親快樂的，莫如你帮助她操作，輕减她的辛苦。所以每年逢到紀念母親節，你得找一件最能使你母親快樂的事情做。</p>
<h3>有意義的紀念</h3>
<p>— 胡悲</p>
<p>在母親節以前一星期，突然接到一位陌生人寄來的英文信，信中所說的話，很引起我的興趣。現在特把這封信公開出來，讓讀者共同玩味。這封信說：</p>
<p>「我一向時常在想母親，想到她的溫柔，想到她的偉大的犧牲，想到她的慈愛，想到她的……唔，你曉得所有那些對母親的無數的賽貴的記憶。我突然想起五月十二日就是母親節了，到那一天世界上所有的人都要尊崇他們的母親，有的在胸前掇一朵康乃馨花，有的人送花或糖菓或其他的東西給母親。我想，也許有些朋友喜歡像我那樣紀念母親節。做母親的人一生最大的苦難和犧牲就是生產。我們逍些能够得到最優良的醫藥設備的人，在生產的時候，都要感到惶恐不安，那麼那些無法請得最好的醫生接生的人呢？帮助窮苦的母親得到適當的醫學上的照顧，不是對我們的母親表示感戴的最好的辦法嗎？因此我捐款給康腦脫路九九五號上海平民婦孺醫院，因爲這是一個帮助窮苦的母親在生產前後得到最好的醫藥設備的地方。在嬰孩出世以後，母親和新生嬰孩住院十日間的醫藥費用需要國幣二萬元。我想你也許願意在母親節這一天用這個方法來紀念你的母親吧。」</p>
<p>後來經調査的結果，知道這個醫院是名醫師王逸慧博士所主持的，設備相當完備，實在吾要做母親的窮苦產婦的好去處。如果讀者中有人想用這個有意義的方式來紀念他們的母親可以直接捐款給該院。</p>
<h3>小衣裙</h3>
<p>— 淑芳</p>
<p>這是適於現在時令穿的小衣裙，最好用布料。上衣用白府綢料，的一碼左右。小裙的四尺料子。以大紅底子小白花或天藍底子的爲美。</p>
<p>依圖中式樣斟酌大小剪裁。將裙子斜裁成一半圓形，安腰帶，再加上背帶即可成一極美好簡單小裙。上衣製法甚簡單，亦可製成長袖，配在任何顏色裙子內都顯得很雅潔的。</p>
<h3>勝利後的母親節</h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>記得在三十一年五月十日，本報曾發刊母親節特刋，那時正値第二屆母親節，曾爲道一個節目，制定三種意義，就是一，發揚考親美德，二，推行父母敎育，三，救濟困苦父母。</p>
<p>本月十二日，，我們曾慶祝勝利後的第一個母親節，我以爲上述三點依舊是適合的關於第一點，孝親本來是我國人認爲一種德行的，但一部份人因爲被不純粹的思想所麻痺，以爲孝親是不合時宜的，在這個道德亟須重振的時候，更應該加以糾正和注意。</p>
<p>關於第二點，我以爲更屬重要，因爲我國對於父母敎育的歷史很短，一般人都不知道怎樣做父母，他們不能了解父母和子女之問的關係終究應該怎樣，於是父母子女之間，不能有一種協調的生活，對於齊家的工作，成爲很大的障礙。</p>
<p>第三點救濟困苦父母，固然是消極的舉動，但爲整個社會着想，能够以多餘的力量，從事救濟，也可以促進一般家庭的幸福，並使整個社曾秩序趨於完善。</p>

<h3>Standing Committee Decides on Two Principles for Tightening the Central Party Headquarters Organization: A Total of Eleven Units Under the Executive Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 15th] This morning's Central Standing Committee decided on the following two principles regarding the tightening of the organization of the Central Party Headquarters: (1) Under the Central Executive Committee, there will be the following departments: Organization, Propaganda, Agriculture and Labor, and Overseas Affairs.

<h3>Registration for National Assembly Representatives Ends Today</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 15th] After the National Assembly was postponed, registration for representatives was suspended starting on the 19th of last month. However, the preparatory committees of the provinces that arrived in Nanjing afterward were still registered and accommodated. Up to now, there have been seven such preparatory committees. A total of 238 representatives have been registered in these seven groups. 501 people had formally registered before that. The preparatory committee will stop registration starting from the 16th.

<h3>Yining Incident Agreement: Clauses Still Being Sorted Out</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 15th] Amidst reports that the Yining Incident is about to be resolved satisfactorily, according to a relevant person who recently flew from Dihua to Nanjing, there was a twist in the story that is worth tracing. It is said that since General Zhang Zhizhong received the order to concurrently serve as the Provincial Chairman in early April and returned to Dihua, he has been negotiating with the Yining representatives based on the agreement he was responsible for responding to in January of this year, specifically on Appendix 2 (i.e., the issue of reorganizing the troops involved in the incident), which still needed to be further discussed. However, after two months of delay, no result was achieved. The reason was that the Yining representatives insisted that the incident troops should be reorganized into at least thirteen regiments and demanded that these troops be stationed throughout Xinjiang. They also requested that the Deputy Commander of the Xinjiang Garrison be appointed by the Yining side. Zhang only agreed to consider the last point, while he only allowed a maximum of four regiments to be reorganized, leading the negotiations into a stalemate. At the beginning of this month, Zhang became anxious and uneasy, his daily life and diet were disrupted, and on May 8, he issued a letter to all compatriots in Xinjiang, clarifying the government's sincerity in seeking peace and the reasons for the prolonged negotiations. The letter pointed out that although he assumed the position of Provincial Chairman on April 8, government decrees could not be extended to the entire province, and construction work could not begin. However, he still stated that he would maintain the greatest patience to seek a peaceful resolution to the Yining Incident. On May 11, after Zhang's efforts and the mediation of the Soviet Consul, the Yining side reduced the original demand of thirteen regiments to eight regiments, and the requirement to station troops throughout Xinjiang was changed to stationing them in Dihua, Hax, and Aksu. At this point, the foundation for the agreement was finalized.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 15th] The agreement to resolve the Yining Incident was not signed today, reportedly because the clauses are not yet complete. This afternoon, both parties had some time to discuss this, but the clauses were still not finalized by the time of the dispatch.</p>
<h3>Pauley Goes to Korea</h3>
<p>Will Enter Soviet-Occupied Zone</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 15th] US Reparations Commissioner Pauley told reporters today that he will go to Korea on the 16th and "will knock on the door of the 38th parallel (i.e., the boundary line between the US-occupied zone in southern Korea and the Soviet-occupied zone in northern Korea) to seek entry into the Soviet-occupied zone." The US government requested the Soviet government in October last year to allow Pauley to enter the Soviet-occupied zone in Korea to conduct investigations, but has not received a response. Pauley was unable to enter the nine northeastern provinces and the Soviet military-occupied part of Korea to carry out his investigation mission. This time he said he would personally meet with Soviet sentries on the boundary line.</p>
<h3>Yu Youren Arrives in Nanjing Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Communist Army Intensifies Blockade of Jinan: Severe Coal Shortage, Food Prices Soar, Power Supply Stopped, Turning City into Dark World</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Correspondent, 15th] Due to the tight blockade of land and water transportation by the Communist army in the surrounding areas, the source of supplies is gradually nearing exhaustion. Currently, only vermicelli and straw can be allowed to pass through by the Communist army. Food and coal are absolutely prohibited, resulting in soaring prices in the past week, especially food prices. The threat of coal shortage is also becoming increasingly serious. The Jinan Power Company is running out of coal. The transportation of coal has been intercepted by the Communist army. With the approval of the military authorities, the power supply has been temporarily suspended since last night, and the city is dark and without light, a dark world.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Correspondent, 15th] The Communist army in Shandong has recently increased its troops in Liaocheng, Zhangdian, Dezhou, and Yanzhou, but there are no major conflicts in various places. Zhangling is still occupied by the Communist army. The Jinan group will go to Linyi to meet with Chen Yi to discuss matters. The CCP has intensified its blockade of Jinan's supplies. Coal transported from Zhangdian to Jinan has been detained by the Communist army in Zaoyuansi. The price of coal and food in Jinan has soared. The coal shortage is particularly serious, with each ton rising to 200,000 yuan, which is still not easy to buy. The power company's coal storage is exhausted. Except for important institutions, power was cut off on the 14th. The Jinan group's government representative, Wen Ze, invited CCP representatives Kuang Rennong and others on the 14th to discuss matters and decided to send someone to Zaoyuansi to negotiate the release of coal.</p>

<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 14th] The CCP side of the Military Mediation Department today again requested the government to increase loans to the Dongjiang Column in Guangzhou to facilitate the withdrawal of the troops. The government side stated that it could be considered if the Executive Group guaranteed that the funds would not be used for other purposes.

<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 15th] The Xinmin Bao here today said that Sipingjie, a strong stronghold of the Communist army that had been fiercely contested for several weeks, was completely occupied by the National Army yesterday.

<h3>Wu Guozhen Offers Farewell Remarks at the Capital Journalists' Association: Government and the Press Should Trust and Cooperate Seamlessly</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 15th] The new Mayor of Shanghai, Wu Guozhen, provided three key points of advice at a farewell dinner at the Capital Journalists' Association at 7:00 PM on the 15th: (1) With our joint efforts, the freedom of the press that the world needs can be said to have reached 99%. This is a beautiful result of mutual encouragement and assistance between the government and the press, and we should cherish it. (2) The development of China's press symbolizes a bright future for the country, but in terms of the entire country, it is hoped that those who are dedicated to the press will pay more attention to and promote journalism in provinces and regions lacking newspapers. Take New York as an example. The population of New York State is as high as 12 million, and the population within New York City is 6 million. However, there are only seven newspapers in New York. Even in the developed press of the United Kingdom, the number of newspapers in London is not much larger. If we hope that China's press will develop normally, we should take this as a lesson. (3) "Freedom of the press" and "democratic politics" are treasures of civilized countries and essential conditions for establishing modern countries. We will have both. The responsibility of the press in the future is extremely important and great. It is hoped that the government and the press will trust and help each other and cooperate seamlessly to promote political progress. Finally, Wu said that in the future, the government should trust reporters and inform the press of its achievements and difficulties at any time to provide the public with faithful reports. At the same time, he hoped that the press would trust the government and carefully consider its choices in selecting news to facilitate interviews. After the speech, everyone happily dined together and dispersed around 8:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Marshall Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing for a Private Visit at the Invitation of Madame Chiang</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Marshal Marshall, the U.S. Special Envoy to China, has been extremely diligent in presiding over the Kuomintang-Communist mediation efforts for the past few months. Yesterday at 11:20 AM, he arrived in Shanghai by special plane, accompanied by Lieutenant General Gillem, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Forces in China, and others. It is reported that Marshal Marshall's visit is purely at the invitation of Madame Chiang Kai-shek, in the capacity of a private guest for a visit. Therefore, neither the municipal authorities nor the U.S. military headquarters personnel were fully informed in advance. Those who welcomed him at Jiangwan Airport were only General Matthews, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Forces, General Eaker, Commander of the Air Force, and a few others. At Madame Chiang's request, Marshal Marshall and his wife will be staying at the Chairman's residence on Dongping Road for a short period. He will return to Nanjing in the next few days and will decline all meetings and social engagements.

<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 14th] Zhou Enlai held a second meeting with Special Envoy Marshall on the 14th, lasting one and a half hours. He declined to comment afterward, but it is understood that the two sides' views on resolving the Northeast issue still seem far apart. According to sources close to Marshall, Marshall met with Xu Yongchang late tonight to discuss the execution of the executive groups and the maintenance of peace in mainland China. Zhou Enlai declared after meeting with Special Envoy Marshall that there was nothing worth mentioning in the conversation and that a solution to the Northeast disputes has not yet been found.</p>

<h3>Supreme Court Upholds Original Verdict: Traitor Chen Gongbo Cannot Escape Death; Traitor Li Shengwu Prosecuted by the Capital High Court</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] After the Jiangsu High Court sentenced the arch-traitor Chen Gongbo to death on April 12th, the case was submitted to the Supreme Court for review. On the 14th, the Supreme Court announced the result of the review, with the main text stating, "The original verdict is approved." The Supreme Court also approved the death sentence in the case of traitor Miao Bin on May 3rd. Thus, the death sentences of the two traitors have been finalized and are awaiting execution.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] Li Shengwu, the puppet Minister of Education, has been prosecuted by the Capital High Court after being transferred there and repeatedly investigated by the prosecutor in accordance with the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. The indictment is summarized as follows: Facts of the crime: The defendant, Li Shengwu, is a member of the Kuomintang, and has served as a specialist member of the Central Political Committee, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Counselor of the Executive Yuan. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, he moved to Hong Kong with the Commercial Press, serving as the chief editor of the press and a member of the National Political Council. When Wang Jingwei issued his infamous telegram and was persuaded by him, he went to Shanghai in the 28th year of the Republic to serve as a member of the Puppet Central Executive Committee and a standing committee member, as well as a member of the Puppet Central Political Committee. In March of the following year, the puppet government was established under the protection of the Japanese invaders, and the defendant was appointed as the Puppet Minister of Judicial Administration. In the spring of the 30th year, Chu Minyi, the Puppet Minister of Foreign Affairs, was transferred to serve as the Puppet Governor of Guangdong Province, and the defendant concurrently served as the head of that ministry until he resigned after the Japanese invaders surrendered last year. The defendant was captured by the Military Commission's Bureau of Investigation and Statistics and sent to the court for investigation. It is found that although the defendant Li Shengwu repeatedly defended himself during the investigation, it is found that (1) If the defendant opposed Wang Jingwei's betrayal of the central government and the establishment of another government, why would he accept his invitation to go from Hong Kong to Shanghai? Moreover, it is not uncommon for Jiang's confidants to refuse to participate in the puppet organization. Now, claiming that there would be a danger to his life if he did not hold a puppet position, its untruthfulness can be generally seen. Moreover, the defendant has held a puppet position for more than five years, during which time there was no lack of opportunities to avoid it, which is sufficient to show that the claim is a decoration. (2) It is known to all enlightened people that the Japanese invaders have been plotting to destroy our country day and night for decades. The puppet National Government was created by the Japanese invaders because they were unable to control the occupied areas, and they had no choice but to create this puppet organization to drive and spur them on, in order to achieve their goal of consolidating the occupied areas, so as to facilitate a full-scale attack on our central government. Although the defendant cunningly claimed that according to international law during wartime, the occupied areas are temporarily occupied by the enemy, not ceded, and the preservation of the culture of the occupied areas should be the responsibility of our own people, it is not known that the defendant held an important puppet position in the puppet National Government, followed the instructions of the Japanese invaders, and promoted anesthetic youth enslavement education. How can it be said that it is preserving culture? (3) After Wang organized the puppet National Government, he plundered resources, blocked rural areas, recruited bandits, issued puppet currency, publicly sold opium, and enslaved young people in the occupied areas. Almost none of these were not harmful to the country and the people. The defendant successively headed the departments of justice, administration, education, and foreign affairs, promoted his government decrees, and helped him commit his crimes. However, he still lavishly talked about preserving the national vitality and the Three People's Principles of resistance war education. In view of the facts, it is just the opposite. As for not participating in important meetings of the puppet party, it is found that the defendant was a standing member of the puppet Central Executive Committee and a member of the puppet Political Conference, and he has served as a puppet minister for many years. Who would believe that he did not participate in important meetings of the puppet party? In summary, none of the defenses are false and cunning, and they are not worthy of adoption. His behavior is a violation of the first item of the second article of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. Therefore, a public prosecution is filed in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Procedure Law and Article 230, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>
<h3>Qi Xieyuan and Others Transferred to Military Law Office; Dong Kang, a Traitor, Indicted</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 14th] The third batch of military traitors, Qi Xieyuan, Shao Wenkai, Huang Nanpeng, Zhao Jinshan, Ye Hua, Wang Bin, and 17 others, have been investigated by the military organs here, and it has been decided to transfer them to the military law office of the headquarters on the morning of the 15th.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The prosecutor of the Hebei High Court has filed a public prosecution against Dong Kang, a major judicial traitor in North China. The main points of his indictment are (1) After the enemy invaded and occupied North China, he cooperated with Wang Kemin and others, participated in the puppet North China Political Affairs Committee, and served as the chairman of the Judicial Committee. Although he has changed his position since then, he has served in puppet positions for eight years. (2) Conspiring with the enemy and betraying the motherland is a clear fact. (3) The defendant claims to have been induced by Tang Erhe, but how could he have been induced by him every day for eight years? (4) The defendant claims to be 80 years old, but according to the annual calculation, he was born on the 22nd day of the Yin month of the Dingmao year of the Tongzhi reign, so he is not yet 80 years old. (5) The defendant is highly suspected of violating Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1, of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. A public prosecution is filed in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1, of the Special Criminal Cases Procedure Law.</p>
<h3>Former Corrupt Puppet Officials in Shanghai Sentenced for Treason</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 15th] The major corruption case of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Consumption Special Tax Bureau, which once shocked the whole country, involved more than 30 officials. At that time, it was investigated by the puppet Nanjing Higher Court, and they were sentenced to two years and six months in prison. Before they had served one year, the Anti-Japanese War was won. After the restoration of the judicial system in Nanjing, the prisoners in the case were released without continuing their sentences at their request. Later, on suspicion of being traitors, Guo Shaoji, the puppet section chief in the case, and Xu Gui, Wu Songlin, Zhu Junqing, Wang Beishui, Zhu Lianming, Chen Kaiyuan, Shi Renji, Zhu Hanjie, Hua Guozhong, Shen Jingmao, Qin Zhongyi, Zhou Guangyao, He Bailin, and Lin Jianxiang, were arrested and transferred to the Suzhou High Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. The Criminal Court of the High Court has now concluded the trial and sentenced the following on the afternoon of the 15th: Guo Shaoji and four others were sentenced to five years in prison, Zhu Lianming and six others were sentenced to four years in prison, and Zhou Guangyao and two others were sentenced to three years in prison.</p>

<h3>General Sun Liren Arrives in Shanghai and Will Go to Nanjing to Report to the Authorities in the Coming Days; Met with MacArthur in Tokyo on the Way</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Our City] General Sun Liren, commander of the New Army, previously attended the United Nations Military Staff Committee meeting in the United States with General Wen Zhen, and jointly discussed and drafted the International Security Force plan with military staff members of the Allied countries. He completed his public duties and arrived in Tokyo from the United States by plane on the 13th. Yesterday at 12:00 noon, he departed from Tokyo on an A.T.C. No. 5511 special plane and returned to China, arriving in Shanghai at 3:55 PM. The welcomers at Jiangwan Airport included Shen Shihua, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Jiang Zhuyi, Secretary-General of the National Diplomacy Association, Colonel Cullen of the U.S. Military Headquarters, and many of Sun's friends. Sun wore an army uniform, high boots, and the "New First Army" designation on his shoulder, with the U.S. Army Medal on the corner of his upper pocket, and a light yellow overcoat in his hand. He looked radiant. The reporter first asked Sun about his impressions of attending the United Nations Military Staff Committee meeting and the drafting process of the International Security Force plan. He smiled and replied: "I am a soldier, and I am unwilling to express too much until the time for publication." The reporter then asked about the New First Army's garrison plan and whether Sun planned to go to the Northeast. Sun also smiled and did not give a definite answer. Finally, Sun stated that he was very grateful for the convenience provided by the U.S. military along the way on his return to China. He arrived in Tokyo on the 13th and met with MacArthur. He was originally scheduled to depart for China on the 14th, but was delayed by one day due to a plane malfunction, so he was able to attend the International Military Tribunal's observation of the Japanese war criminal Kiyose. Tokyo is currently experiencing a shortage of food, and prices are rising, but order is still good due to encouragement and restraint. After Sun finished speaking, he took a car to his residence at the Broadway Mansion for rest. It is reported that Sun will stay in Shanghai for a short time before going to Nanjing to report to the highest authorities.</p>

<h3>Representatives of the Democratic League and the Political Consultative Conference Invite Newspaper Reporters</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Huang Yanpei, Liang Shuming, Zhang Bojun, Zhang Junmai, and other representatives of the Democratic League to the Shanghai Political Consultative Conference, invited newspaper reporters yesterday afternoon. However, Zhang Junmai was not present temporarily. Chairman Huang Yanpei, Liang, Zhang, and others spoke successively and answered the questions raised by the reporters. The event lasted for one hour. The main idea was that the purpose of the Democratic League is to unite the whole country and hope to realize democratic politics. Its primary task is to strive for peace. This effort has never been slackened. The four of them have four appeals regarding the current situation: (1) Compatriots from all walks of life across the country should unite to stop the civil war and save the critical situation. (2) In accordance with the words announced in the Kuomintang-Communist negotiations record of the Double Tenth Festival last year, it is recognized that the civil war is a violation of their original intentions. (3) The authorities on both sides should voluntarily make greater concessions, jointly respect the implementation of the ceasefire order of the Military Mediation Department, and a ceasefire order should be implemented uniformly throughout the country. (4) Reopen the consultative conference to resolve the unfinished issues of the previous time, and urge the implementation of various agreements, and embark on the road of peaceful nation-building that was paved a hundred days ago.</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Further Explanation of the Four Appeals</h3>
<p>Huang Yanpei, Liang Shuming, Zhang Bojun, and other representatives of the Democratic League at the Political Consultative Conference, hosted reporters in Shanghai yesterday, and reported that they had made an appeal with regard to the current situation: (1) We request all compatriots across the country to unite to stop the civil war; (2) We request the Kuomintang and the Communist Party not to make the mistake of civil war; (3) We urge that the ceasefire order in the Northeast and other places be thoroughly implemented; (4) Reopen the Consultative Conference. The good intentions of appeasement are worthy of our admiration. However, we would like to give the representatives of the Democratic League a further explanation.</p>
<p>"Civil war" is hated by everyone, the ceasefire is an order that the government and the Communist Party have long issued, and consultation is a work that the representatives of the Democratic League personally participated in. At that time, there seemed to be an agreement, so why do we still have to trouble everyone to appeal today? We want to ask everyone: Which side provoked the "civil war"? Which side first violated the ceasefire order? At the Consultative Conference, it was agreed that the Northeast would be taken over by the National Government and was not within the scope of military mediation. Which side is the first to not implement the agreement and insists on using troops to seize Changchun? In addition, which troops are attacking cities and destroying railways everywhere in the interior? Since the representatives of the Democratic League are compassionate and appeal for peace, I wonder what their feelings are about the troublemakers who are determined to undermine peace? Everyone is urging both sides to make concessions. Can they guarantee that the central government will continue to make concessions, and will the Communist Party be able to achieve true peace from then on? If you don't ask right and wrong, then after the robbery, should you also call on the robbed and the robber to make concessions to be fair and worthy of appeasement?</p>
<p>Forget it! Please don't forget that you are also the masters of the country and participants in the consultation. Troublemakers simply look down on you and don't take the agreements you have participated in seriously. Not only can you do nothing about it, but you still have to follow them and shout "ceasefire" after they have occupied some territory!</p>
<p>To be honest, just appealing is not useful. You must have your eyes open to see clearly which side is violating the ceasefire order, and then use your power to punish those who violate the ceasefire order to truly stop the civil war. The representatives of the Democratic League ask themselves: Where are your eyes? Where is your power?</p>

<p>Large Numbers of Black Insects Found in Wheat Fields In Zhangjing Bridge, Hongsheng Town, Nanmiao Lane, Nanmen, and other places in this county, large numbers of black insects have been found in wheat fields. When first born, they are only a little over a fen [unit of length, approx. 1/3 cm] long, but within a week, they are almost identical to silkworms in shape. Their bodies are covered in black hairs, and they crawl on the wheat stalks, chewing on the leaves. They are everywhere within a fifty-li [unit of distance, approx. 50 km] radius, which is alarming. In recent days, there are no intact wheat leaves, and they have already started eating the wheat ears. This is enough to form a disastrous famine. At the same time, they have also been found in Xinzhuang on the border of Cheng and Yu, and in Houtai, Dafang Bridge, Jian'an Bridge, and other places in this county. It is predicted that this summer's harvest will be at most two dou [unit of volume, approx. 20 liters] per mu [unit of area, approx. 1/15 hectare], and the farmers are all lamenting their suffering to the heavens.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Unification and Division of India</h3>
<p>According to news from Shimla, the roundtable conference attempting to resolve the Indian situation has failed because the Congress Party and the Muslim League could not reach an agreement. The British and Indian sides will issue a formal document today (the 16th). This document will touch upon the issue of Indian independence. It seems that the British cabinet delegation to India has revealed its intention to abandon its rule over India. Therefore, before leaving Shimla for New Delhi, Gandhi urged Indians to prepare to fight for freedom. Another report said that Indian Governor Wavell is considering establishing an interim government as soon as possible, and establishing a constitutional institution with the support of all the people. Since this news came out, the Indian situation has once again become the concern of the world. According to various indications, how the British government will attempt to break the deadlock in India after the end of the three-party roundtable conference, and seek another way to resolve it, remains to be seen in the British government's official announcement. But the reason why the Indian situation is difficult to reach an agreement, and how the future Indian situation will unfold, we, as a friendly neighbor, would like to express our views.</p>
<p>First of all, what we want to say is that although China and India are friendly neighbors with historical friendship, the understanding of the current situation of each other between the Chinese and Indian nations is really not enough. India is an extremely complex place, and what we know is really limited. China's understanding of India is closely linked to the introduction of Buddhism. Some people think that India is still a Buddhist country today, but they do not know that after traveling through India, it is impossible to find a follower of Sakyamuni today. Our understanding of India is too insufficient. Although the Chinese and Indian nations are both ancient civilizations in Asia, the historical development of these two nations is completely different. China is a nation with a strong sense of history, while India can be said to have no sense of history at all. China has the treasure house of the Twenty-Four Histories, while the historical records of India are almost entirely dependent on foreign countries, especially China. China is a geographical unit, and it completed political unification as early as two thousand years ago, while India has never been unified since its history until now. At present, there is British India, French India, Portuguese India, and native emperors under British protection. The Maurya Dynasty can be said to be a "great unification" situation of pure Indians, but its power does not extend to the south of India. Emperor Akbar of the Mughal Empire came from Central Asia outside India and devoted himself to the unification of India, but he also died with his ambition, and his long-cherished wish was not fulfilled. Since the beginning of history, there has never been a unified India! This is the historical destiny of the Indian people!</p>
<p>Since the Indian people had a national awakening, under the leadership of Gandhi and Nehru, they actively launched the national liberation movement, and the Indian people have yearned for the establishment of a modern, independent, and unified India. The unfolding of this movement has also prompted the awakening of the Muslim people; in order to protect the interests of the Muslim people, they have also launched their political actions under the banner of the "Muslim League" and under the call of "Pakistan"? Because of the accumulation of historical reasons, the residents of northwest and northern India, and even Bengal and Assam in the east, are almost entirely or mostly Muslim people. Although they and the Hindus are both in India, the differences in language, religion, and living habits make them seem like two different nations. Indians have an extremely strong concept of class, and there are lowly untouchable classes, while Muslims have no distinction between rich and poor, and all worship in the same mosque. Indians regard cows as sacred and inviolable, while Muslims often use beef as food. With these various differences, where Indians and Muslims live together, often minor incidents lead to major changes. For example, if a Muslim throws beef on the land where Indians live, the Indians think it is blasphemy, and they will definitely start a major fight with the Muslims; similarly, if an Indian throws pork on the land where Muslims live, it will also lead to equal consequences. The hatred between Indians and Muslims is extremely deep, and it does seem difficult to cooperate. The failure of this three-party conference is due to the fact that the Congress Party represented by Gandhi and Nehru advocated that India should establish a unified India under the leadership of Hindus, while the Muslim League represented by Jinnah insisted on the separation of India and Muslims, and the Muslim people must establish their</p>
<p>Standing on the standpoint of the Chinese National Revolution, we certainly hope that a unified and independent India can emerge. But if we objectively examine the Indian situation, if Britain withdraws from India and establishes an independent and unified India under the leadership of the Indians represented by the Congress Party, it will inevitably lead to the opposition of more than one-third of the Muslim people in India, and make India, Asia, and even the entire world unstable. The different ideas between the Indian and Muslim people are too deep, and no one can simultaneously play the role of leading the Indian and Muslim people. In the two thousand years since the Maurya Dynasty, the Indian people have often been ruled by foreign ethnic groups; in these two thousand years, foreign populations and foreign religions and other historical factors have established an unshakable foundation in the northwest, north, and east of India. We cannot ignore this point. Here, we want to particularly state that our country also has a Muslim population that is not small, but the Muslim problem in India is fundamentally different from the Muslim population in China. The Chinese people who believe in Islam are constituent members of the Chinese nation, and they are completely integrated with the non-Muslim Chinese people in terms of history and culture. This is not comparable to the Indian Muslim independence movement. The backgrounds are different, and they cannot be regarded as the same. The Chinese nation is one, but India is not like this.</p>
<p>The independence of India is an extremely arduous task. Currently, the Labour Party is in power in Britain. The Labour Party's policy towards India has always been more enlightened than the Conservative Party led by Churchill. The British government led by Attlee sent a cabinet delegation to India to promote the independence of India and conducted negotiations with the Congress Party and the Muslim League. We are naturally very pleased with this wise move by the British government. Now that the three-party conference has failed, it goes without saying that the British government will continue to work hard to find a solution. A divided India will of course easily lead to future dangers; but a unified India also has the current realistic obstacles. How to reconcile the respective wishes of the Indian and Muslim people, so that the ideals of both sides can be realized without harming the external unity of India, is hoped to be achieved through the forbearance of the leaders of both sides, and especially through the wise mediation of a third party. An unstable India is closely related to China's security. We hope that the people of the three parties can use their wisdom to break the current deadlock.</p>

<h3>Differing Opinions Difficult to Eliminate Foreign Ministers' Conference Ends Within the Week US Proposes to Reopen on the 15th of Next Month Discussion of German Issues Yesterday, Soviet Union Opposes Our Participation</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 15th Broadcast: The four-power foreign ministers' conference, which has been meeting for three weeks, is now coming to an end and should be over by the end of this week. The foreign ministers are scheduled to discuss the German issue today in an attempt to reach an agreement so that the conference will not be a complete failure. The British and American delegations will state that although the talks have reached a stalemate, they have not been completely fruitless. At the same time, thanks to the frank discussions of the four foreign ministers, agreements have been reached on a number of minor issues.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] London, 15th Broadcast: This morning, the four foreign ministers held an informal meeting in Paris to discuss the German issue. Bevin suggested that each foreign minister appoint a special representative to study the entire German issue and try to draft a peace treaty to be submitted to the peace conference, which will be held on November 12. Bevin also suggested that the representatives should review the relevant issues related to Germany at the next meeting. The French foreign minister proposed to promote the internationalization of the Ruhr and Rhineland regions, pointing out that the separation of these two regions from Germany is the best way to prevent Germany from aggressing again.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris 14th Dispatch] US Secretary of State Byrnes revealed today that China has sent a memorandum to the four foreign ministers, requesting that in accordance with the decisions made at the Potsdam Conference, when the discussion of the German issue begins (which will likely be held on the 15th), a representative be allowed to attend the meeting. Byrnes, Bevin, and Bidault all agreed, but Molotov objected. Molotov said that the current meeting is only a preliminary consultation and should be limited to the occupying countries. (Note: According to the Central News Agency London 14th Dispatch, the BBC's news broadcast said that our country has been invited to participate.)</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Paris 14th Dispatch] US Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the American-occupied zone of Germany, Lieutenant General Clay, and political advisor Murphy have arrived in Paris to participate in the four foreign ministers' conference regarding the discussion of the German issue. Clay and Murphy participated in this morning's foreign ministers' meeting.</p>
<p>[French News Agency Paris 14th Dispatch] The four foreign ministers held a meeting today. US Secretary of State Byrnes, in an effort to save the conference from complete failure, suggested that the meeting be adjourned immediately after the discussion of the German issue and reopened on June 15. At the same time, the four deputy foreign ministers should continue to meet and try to eliminate various differences so that the four foreign ministers can easily compromise with each other when they reopen the meeting next month. Byrnes also put forward three suggestions as follows: (1) Immediately decide to convene a 21-nation peace conference, with the opening date set for July 1 or July 15. If an agreement cannot be reached on this, the opening date of the peace conference will be decided by the four foreign ministers at their next meeting; (2) Immediately revise the armistice agreement with Italy; (3) The draft peace treaty with Austria can be placed on the agenda of the foreign ministers' meeting on June 15, and the other issues to be discussed at that time should be agreed upon by the deputy foreign ministers of each country. The British and French foreign ministers expressed their agreement in principle to these suggestions, but they jointly requested the Soviet foreign minister to consider them at length. The foreign ministers' meeting today decided to refer the issue of the disposal of Italian colonies and the issue of the border between Italy and Greece to the deputy foreign ministers' meeting for discussion.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris 15th Dispatch] People close to the Soviet delegation predicted today that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will agree to the US proposal to convene a 21-nation peace conference in July after the four foreign ministers meet again next month. US Secretary of State Byrnes' suggestion has four items in total, and Molotov is expected to agree to three of them, but he is determined not to include the Austrian peace treaty on the agenda of the four foreign ministers' meeting on June 15. Judging from the situation, the current meeting may end its work on the 16th, but a basic agreement on the peace treaty has not yet been reached. It is said that President Truman's special plane has already set off for Paris to pick up the US representatives to return to Washington.</p>

The British delegation is not expected to issue a document before Thursday, but it will not be delayed for long. Indian political figures expect that the British cabinet delegation will include suggestions such as the interim government and long-term solutions in the document. Well-informed sources in Shimla believe that the Congress Party will submit a list to the Governor in the name of participating in the interim government as representatives.</p>
<p>[Reuters London 15th Dispatch] British Prime Minister Attlee told the House of Commons yesterday that I will be able to issue a document on India before the end of this week. Opposition leader Churchill asked the Prime Minister whether, for the sake of convenience, a motion to adjourn could be moved when the document is issued, so that questions and comments could be raised in accordance with the procedure. According to the procedure, if a motion to adjourn is not moved, the opposition party can only raise questions in the House of Commons. Attlee seemed to tacitly approve this request, but everyone opposed it. Conservative figures now expect Churchill to be waiting for this opportunity to attack the domestic policy of the British government again. The Conservative Party is also waiting for Churchill to return to the House of Commons to lead the matter, but the direction of the attack is still unknown.</p>
<h3>Shaw's Satire on Indian Politics: Brave in Internal Conflicts, None of Your Business</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] - Mr. Shaw declined an invitation from the Tagore Society of India to attend a birthday banquet for Tagore. In his reply, Mr. Shaw stated that, being an elderly person, he could not attend such a celebratory event.

<p>Franco-Siamese Negotiations Underway</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 15th] - Government officials announced today that the United States and the United Kingdom have made a "suggestion" to France that French forces in Vietnam should not invade Siamese territory. It is reported that a week ago, French forces fired machine guns and rifles across the Mekong River at the Siamese town of Makong Phanom, causing considerable damage to the town's houses. Allegedly, the Siamese residents refused to hand over Annamese people who had fled there, leading to the French attack. These Annamese people oppose Vietnam remaining under French rule after the war.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Bangkok, 15th] - The Siamese Prime Minister informed an intelligence conference yesterday that the French claim that Siamese people had entered Vietnamese territory to loot a village was actually the work of Annamese guerrillas hiding near the Siamese border. This was the report obtained by government representatives and British and American observers after investigating the area. He expressed deep regret over the matter and stated that negotiations have begun.</p>

<h3>Far East International Tribunal Announces: Indefinite Suspension of Trials; Defendant's Defense Counsel's Unreasonable Complaints Rejected; Twenty American Civilian Lawyers Rush to Tokyo</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] - The Far East International Military Tribunal adjourned today after abruptly interrupting the defense counsel's complaints, announcing that the trial was suspended indefinitely. At the hearing today, American legal counsel Clement, representing five Japanese defendants including former Prime Minister Kiichiro Hiranuma, again accused the eleven judges of lacking the qualifications to judge the various charges in the indictment. He also stated that international law does not stipulate the various charges in the indictment. The defense also requested the prosecution to clearly state the charges, locations, and circumstances of the alleged conspiracy to launch a war of aggression and other crimes. Clement also declared that it was inappropriate for the defendants to be tried as "ordinary murderers." The complaint also demanded a list of all witnesses and the names of witnesses interviewed by the prosecution, as well as all physical evidence for the 55 charges upon which the indictment was based. British Assistant Prosecutor Karr opposed the defense counsel's request, stating that the requested information had already been announced. Chief Justice Webb also stated that Clement's arguments were not very helpful. The court then temporarily adjourned for private deliberation, and soon after, the bailiff announced an indefinite suspension of the trial.</p>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 14th] - Twenty American civilian lawyers left Hamilton Airfield on Monday evening aboard a military transport plane bound for Tokyo to defend the 28 war criminals, hoping to arrive in Japan this week, but they fear they will not have sufficient preparation time to appear in court on June 3 for the trial.</p>

<h3>Allied Council for Japan: Soviet Representative Raises Questions</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] - At today's meeting of the Four-Power Allied Council for Japan, Soviet representative Telefyanko proposed that the Supreme Commander of the United Nations should include draft directives for the implementation of the occupation in the Council's agenda. American representative Atcheson, the chairman of the committee, immediately replied that pre-discussion by the council of important directives proposed by the Supreme Commander to the Japanese government would impede the occupation and would be unreasonable. Such a procedure would transform the Control Council into a negotiating body for the four interested countries. The authority of the committee is nothing more than to provide opinions and assist in the implementation of policies already negotiated between the governments. However, the Supreme Commander can notify the Control Council 48 hours before issuing the directive. The Soviet representative also raised the issue of the repatriation of Japanese soldiers and the possible secret activities of retired Japanese officers. A spokesman for the Supreme Commander replied that 226,599 Japanese army and navy officers had been repatriated. So far, under close surveillance, there is little evidence to suggest that Japanese officers are attempting to engage in underground activities.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] - Acting Secretary of State Acheson told reporters today that the US and Britain have been discussing the issue of Pacific island bases for some time. The United States has established bases on some islands and the US Army and Navy still have interests in them.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 15th] - Authoritative sources here say that Britain has refused to transfer sovereignty of Christmas Island, Canton Island, and Funafuti Island in the western Pacific to the United States. Acting Secretary of State Acheson said that the US and Britain both claim sovereignty over these three islands and several others. It is reported that British Foreign Secretary Bevin told US Secretary of State Byrnes in Paris that if the United States was willing to join the British and New Zealand regional defense system in the Southwest and South Pacific, then Britain would be willing to cede the three islands to the United States as bases, but this would not affect British sovereignty. Britain can also set up bases on the islands.</p>

If the House vetoes it, trade between the United States and Britain and the sterling area will be impossible. In other words, Egyptian and Indian cotton will replace American cotton, South African and Near Eastern tobacco will replace American tobacco, and British cars and machinery will replace American cars and machinery. The position of American goods in half of the world's trade area will be greatly disadvantaged.</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 14th] - Acting US Secretary of State Acheson told reporters today that economic negotiations between the US and France will be completed soon, and a fixed amount will be loaned to France.</p>
<h3>British Troops to Withdraw from Cairo and Alexandria Before End of July; Britain and Egypt Are Currently Discussing Completing the Deadline for the Withdrawal of Troops; Canal Defense Plan Will Be a Thorny Issue</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 15th] - This question has received orders from senior British authorities, instructing British troops in Cairo and Alexandria to withdraw before the end of July. At the same time, according to authoritative sources, Britain estimates that the value of military equipment in Egypt is about £160 million, and intends to transfer it to Egypt, but the Egyptian side said that the value of this equipment is at most only half of it, or £80 million. This is also one of the problems facing the representatives of the amendment negotiations. Although British troops in Cairo and Alexandria have been ordered to withdraw before the end of July, the question of when all British troops in Egypt can withdraw remains. Egypt believes that the withdrawal of troops cannot be delayed until after one year, while the British side said that it will take two years to complete the withdrawal. Some representatives even said that it would take five years. The date of complete withdrawal is the main agenda of the negotiations, and it is reported that the two sides have agreed that British experts will accompany the Egyptian military advisory group to inspect the British military facilities to determine a reasonable deadline for the completion of the withdrawal of troops. There are many other issues that need to be discussed, such as how Egypt can protect British interests in Egypt in the event of war or a threat of war, and the defense plan of the Suez Canal. The latter issue is particularly thorny. Britain regards the canal as the lifeline of the empire, so Britain should participate in the defense. However, Egypt believes that Egypt's defense performance in the last war was very good, so there is no need for the British to worry. The Egyptians are determined not to jointly defend Egypt with other countries. The Sudan issue will be discussed at the end of the meeting.</p>
<p>When the representatives of the 47 countries held the 4th meeting of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in Atlantic City, New Jersey, USA, two of the representatives came from the two extremes of the earth, one was the Iranian representative (right) and the other was the Icelandic representative.</p>

Experts from the Army Air Corps hope that after this flight, they can determine the long-term storage and supply of the aircraft, and can more clearly understand the performance of this type of aircraft in emergency formation and deployment.</p>

<p>One of the Three Old Men of the Sea</p>
<h3>Yuan Ludeng's Public Trial Yesterday Morning; Speaking Fluent Shanghai-ized Ningbo Dialect, He Claimed: "Household Rice" Rationing Was Unreliable, Insisting on Resignation; Feigning Illness at a Sanitarium to Gain "Approval"</h3>
<p>[Special Report] Yuan Ludeng, who, during the enemy puppet period, was known as one of the "Three Old Men" of Shanghai, along with Wen Lanting and Lin Kanghou, was first investigated yesterday morning at 8:40 AM by Xiao Luo Changfen of the High Court's Second Special Criminal Tribunal. The defendant retained three lawyers, Chen Tingrui, Li Baosen, and Chao Jimei, as defense counsel, who claimed that the points in the indictment were contrary to the actual situation; his assumption of puppet positions was entirely for the benefit of the people and not at all a collaboration with the enemy. After Presiding Judge Xiao inquired about each point in the indictment, he announced that the hearing would be rescheduled. Because the hearing yesterday morning was not publicly announced beforehand, only a few people were present in the audience; not many of Yuan's family members attended either. Yuan did not request to see his family; only defense lawyer Chen Tingrui spoke with the defendant for three minutes after the court adjourned.</p>
<p>Yuan is from Ningbo, 68 years old, and lives at 4, Alley 16, Beile Road. He originally served as a Chinese director of the Shanghai Former International Settlement. After the fall, he continued to serve as a Chinese director of the Public Works Department. In July of the 31st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1942], he also served concurrently as the Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce; in September, he also served concurrently as the Chairman of the Rice and Grain Control Committee of the Puppet Executive Yuan and as a member of the Nanjing Puppet Materials Review Committee, purchasing rice and grain on behalf of the enemy. In February of the 32nd year, Shanghai was bombed by our planes, and the enemy was uneasy, dividing the central area into six major districts and implementing a blockade policy. The defendant even organized the Baojia system on behalf of the enemy, serving as the Chairman of the Baojia Preparatory Committee, responsible for the preparations; the task was completed in June and handed over to the Baojia Section of the Puppet Police Department, which conducted household registration checks. In the winter of the same year, Shao Shijun organized the Dahua Bank, and the defendant served as the General Manager of the bank, as well as serving concurrently as a member of the Puppet New National Movement Committee and other positions. After the victory, he was arrested and prosecuted by the court.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the defendant wore a half-old purplish-bronze small floral silk robe, white socks, and black shoes, with black-rimmed reading glasses on his nose and a shaved head with white hair, but his demeanor was calm, and his spirits were still good. When answering questions, he spoke fluent Shanghai-ized Ningbo dialect, often with a smile. After Presiding Judge Xiao asked the defendant about his age and origin, he immediately asked what property he had. He replied that most of his property was stocks and that he had submitted a list to the Military Intelligence Bureau; as for the house he lived in, it was rented. He asked, "Who else is in your family?" He replied, "Both my parents are dead. I have one wife, one son who is married and 33 years old, and three grandsons and one granddaughter; the oldest is fifteen years old, and the youngest is only seven years old." Yuan then stated that the indictment written by the prosecutor did not match the defendant's actions because his</p>
<p>assumption of puppet positions was entirely for the benefit of the people and not at all a collaboration with the enemy. Before the incident, in addition to his own business, he had co-founded the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association with Yu Zhiqing and served as a Chinese director of the Public Works Department for more than ten consecutive years. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, all Chinese and Western directors were falsely accused of corruption. In the first half of the 30th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1941], the puppet government wanted to reorganize the Public Works Department, and all four Chinese directors wanted to resign. Three of them went to Hong Kong, and only he was forced to remain by the Japanese. In the second half of the 31st year, the British and American directors were all imprisoned in concentration camps, and he remained in his position until the recovery of the concessions. In July of the 31st year, the Shanghai trade associations petitioned the puppet government to reorganize the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and unanimously recommended him as chairman. After the expiration of his term in the 33rd year, he was still unanimously recommended for reappointment, until November of last year. In September of the 33rd year, Zhou Fohai, the Premier of the Puppet Executive Yuan, appointed him as the chairman of the affiliated Rice and Grain Control Committee, and he raised</p>
<p>two conditions: (1) Increase the purchase price of rice and grain to benefit farmers; (2) Guarantee the rationing of household rice. Zhou said, "As long as you come out, it will not be a problem," so he took the position. The committee had two deputy directors and seven or eight members, overseeing: (1) District A, including twelve counties in Jiangsu and three counties in Zhejiang; (2) District B: northern Jiangsu and Anhui. However, the purchase of rice and grain was handled by the Japanese army. As for the purchase price, it was handled only after being approved by the Japanese army. He had raised the purchase price from two hundred yuan per dan to eight hundred and twenty yuan. Later, due to the excessive rise in prices, the household rice could not continue to be rationed, so he insisted on resigning without success. Later, he feigned illness at the Hongqiao Sanitarium and was finally approved. He also said, "If I had intended to be a traitor, I could have used my power to make a fortune; but I am still very poor. My procurement of rice and grain was entirely to fulfill my obligation, and all public funds were returned to the puppet government, treating it as refugee relief work." It was done for a total of eight months, and the first three months went well, but later</p>
<p>it gradually declined. By the last two months, the rationing of rice was unreliable, which really saddened me, so I had to pretend to be sick and resign." At the same time, he denied attending the Materials Review Committee meeting on November 3 of the 33rd year and serving as the chairman of the joint meeting of the Rice Control Committee on October 13 of the same year. The presiding judge asked, "Were there any Japanese on the Rice Control Committee?" He replied, "There were four or five Japanese members, all representatives of Japanese trading companies such as Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Dahua." He asked, "On September 15 of the 32nd year, the newspaper reported that the committee made a statement saying that the Rice Control Committee's purchase of grain had to "trouble our friendly nations for assistance," is that correct?" He replied, "No, no." He asked, "On October 11 of the 32nd year, the Rice and Grain Procurement Trade Union held a preparatory meeting, and you gave a speech?" He replied, "No, no." He asked, "On May 7 of the 33rd year, did you go to Nanjing to report on the procurement of grain?" He replied, "I went to resign." He asked, "Are you also a member of the National Diplomacy Promotion Committee?" He replied, "This is a tangential matter, and the purpose is still to seek local interests." He asked, "You made many 'Greater East Asia' remarks?" He replied, "I still have my thoughts. As chairman, I can only speak for one or two minutes at most and have never delivered</p>
<p>lengthy speeches. What is published in the newspapers is all fabricated by others, and there was no way to correct it at the time." He asked, "Many prominent people left Shanghai at that time, why did you stay in Shanghai?" He replied, "I myself had to stay in Shanghai to support friends, relatives, and charitable organizations, but I advised Xi Yushu and Xu Jixun to leave Shanghai. Du Yuesheng, Wu Kaixian, and He Dekui all know this." As for the matter of being a sponsoring member of the Puppet Air Force Movement Committee, he claimed that he had never been to the airport. At this point, Yuan could no longer stand and swallowed several Ren Dan pills. Presiding Judge Xiao ordered him to sit down and rest for three minutes and then continued the interrogation. Regarding the organization of the Baojia system, he stated, "On the evening of February 14 of the 31st year, explosions occurred in various parts of Shanghai, and the Japanese army blockaded two-thirds of the concessions, causing great harm to the people. Therefore, the Baojia system was implemented to benefit the people and not to eliminate underground workers." As for serving as the general manager of the Dahua Bank run by Shao Shijun from December of the 32nd year to July of the 34th year, it was because he and Shao were old friends. As for the position of member of the Puppet New National Movement Committee, it was a nominal position, and he never attended meetings. At this point, Presiding Judge Xiao announced a postponement for further hearing.</p>

<p>The Municipal Government established the River-Crossing Engineering Committee, with Mao Yisheng, chief engineer of the Qiantang River Bridge, as the director of the engineering design office of the committee. According to Mao, building a bridge across the Pujiang River is very important for the future of China's construction and the development of Shanghai. As for building a bridge, a low bridge would be cheaper, estimated at about 3 million US dollars. However, when ships pass by, the bridge must be opened, and the bridge surface traffic must be stopped. A high bridge would cost twice as much as a low bridge, about 10 million US dollars. However, when ships pass by, they can pass under the bridge opening, but its engineering is only a quarter of that of the Qiantang River Bridge. The construction cost of the channel is even greater, estimated at more than 10 million US dollars. As for which type of bridge to build and where to build the bridge, no decision has been made yet.</p>

At 3:00 PM, Presiding Judge Liu Shifang, Judges Qu Zengze, Lu Qi, Jiang Baoli, Jiang Baolian, Prosecutor Lin Wopeng, Clerk Feng Junyue, Translator Luo Jing, and designated defense lawyer Qian Naiwen arrived and took their seats. Shimoda was then brought into the court.</p>
<p>After questioning his name, age, origin, and occupation, Prosecutor Lin began reading the original indictment (see this newspaper on the 9th), and the trial began. (Question) Do you have any response to the indictment? (Answer) I was drunk on the day the incident occurred (i.e., during the massacre) and didn't know anything. What the witnesses said is not true. I hope for an investigation. (Question) What year did you come to China? (Answer) 1939. (Question) What did you do in Japan? (Answer) I worked in a naval factory. (Question) After coming to China in 1939, where did you work and in what position? (Answer) I served in the army in Hankou, as a guard. (Question) Where did you go afterwards? (Answer) I went to Yichang, Nanjing, and received military police training in Nanjing, and then I was assigned to the Wuxi Military Police to handle legal, administrative, and special high-level work. (Question) When did you go to Jiangyin? (Answer) In 1942, I was transferred to the Jiangyin Military Police, serving as a military policeman, and later handling special high-level work. (Question) Isn't special high-level work about killing people? (Answer) No, it's about investigating guerrillas, sometimes using those arrested to gather information. (Question) Who was in charge of the Jiangyin Military Police? (Answer) Captain Nagaoka and Squad Leader Saito. (Question) You confessed in Wuxi that you were next in command after Nagaoka and Saito, didn't you? (Answer) I was a sergeant and didn't know about big things. (Question) How many Chinese did the Jiangyin Military Police kill? (Answer) Except for the last time, there were none. (Question) How many people have you killed? (Answer) Absolutely none. (Question) Have you ever seen anyone killed? (Answer) No. (Question) Then why did you say you did during the prosecutor's investigation? (Answer) Early the next morning, Sergeant Shimizu told me that several Chinese had been killed on the night of August 15th. (Question) When did you learn about Japan's surrender? (Answer) At noon on the 15th, we were notified by Wuxi. At that time, we were ordered to burn and destroy all important documents and statistics, which was completed by 7:00 PM. (Question) Did you know if this procedure was legal? (Answer) I didn't know, I was just following orders. (Question) What did you do after 7:00 PM? (Answer) Drank alcohol, because that day was a Japanese memorial day. (Question) Since you knew you had surrendered, why did you drink alcohol? (Answer) The food and drinks were prepared earlier. At first, I was very unhappy when I heard about the surrender, but later I thought about drinking alcohol and going to fight guerrillas. (Question) How many Chinese were arrested at that time? (Answer) About fifteen or sixteen. (Question) How did you feel when you heard about the killing of Chinese people? (Answer) I didn't feel anything. (Question) How does the witness feel about you? (Answer) It was very good in the past. Two days before the peace, I arrested him, which caused his hatred. (Question) Why were the feelings so good in the past? (Answer) Because he was arrested before and I released him. (Question) Have you ever arrested anyone? (Answer) No. (Question) Then did you arrest the witness? (Answer) Yes. (Question) How many people have you arrested? Tell the truth! (Answer) Only three, named Zhang, Shi, and Yu. The rest have been released. (Question) Why was the person named Zhang arrested? (Answer) On August 10th, there were rumors outside that Japan had surrendered. After investigation, it was Zhang who was the main culprit, so I arrested him.</p>
<p>At this point, the witness Jiang Shoutong was brought to the court for confrontation. Jiang is a professor at Fudan University who was arrested in Jiangyin on July 20th last year and released on August 12th. What he saw and heard in prison was appalling. He stated that he witnessed a young man in his twenties, covered in injuries, being carried in by military police on the evening of August 5th, and only learned the next morning that his name was Shi Akang. However, Shi was eventually stabbed to death by Saito during the massacre. He continued to describe the horrific scene of the massacre on August 15th and pointed out that the defendant, in addition to serving as a sergeant, also served as an instructor for the special operations of the Jiangyin puppet organization. The military police arrested at least five or six hundred compatriots in Jiangyin over the past three years, most of whom were brutally murdered. At this point, the court ordered that the case be further investigated and adjourned for another trial.</p>
<p>After a five-minute recess, the court resumed and brought in Yuasa Torakichi, administrator of the Longhua Prisoner of War Camp. Because Yuasa requested that the two points he raised be investigated: (1) his non-military status; (2) the prisoner food supply was not under his management, and proof that he did not kill prisoners. However, because witnesses could not be summoned, the court ordered another adjournment.</p>

<h3>City School Building Problems: Joint Petition for Relief, Telegram to Chairman Chiang, President Song, etc., Calling for Assistance</h3>
<p>[Our City News] During the Anti-Japanese War, municipal middle school buildings in this city were either destroyed or occupied by other organizations for extended periods. For example, the buildings of Wuben Girls' Middle School, Jingye Middle School, Xinlu Normal School, and Wusong Middle School were completely destroyed. Jinyuan Middle School and Xinbei Middle School were occupied by other organizations. Although schools have勉强(biǎn qiǎng: to do with difficulty) commenced classes, the school buildings are not their original ones. Moreover, the Executive Yuan either intends to allocate the current school buildings used by these schools to the private Guanghua University, or to Tongji University, or to return the property to the owners, leaving the schools in a state of uncertainty. It is learned that at the recent meeting of municipal middle school principals, it was decided that the principals would jointly send telegrams to Chairman Chiang, President Song, and Minister Zhu, etc., requesting relief. The original telegram sent to Chairman Chiang is recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegram to the Chairman: To Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government in Nanjing: During the nation-building period, education is paramount, as clearly instructed, with profound significance. Shanghai is an international metropolis, a hub of commerce and industry, with a dense population and a large number of young people gathered here. Nurturing and educating them is of utmost urgency. Since the restoration of the city, the municipal middle schools have been the first to resume operations. We are striving to fulfill this mission under the leadership of Director Gu, deeply aware of the immense responsibility. However, the school buildings have either been destroyed by war or occupied. Very few schools have a secure location, leading to constant displacement, making it difficult to continue. Recently, we have learned that the central government intends to reallocate some of the former Gongdu Bureau elementary school buildings and enemy properties, which the municipal schools have taken over and opened, to some public and private universities. This will cause problems for many municipal middle schools in the next semester, and the impact will be severe. While university education is indeed essential, there is a difference in urgency between opening institutions of higher learning and rescuing those who have lost the opportunity to receive basic education. It is best to achieve both goals in a mutually beneficial manner, rather than sacrificing one for the other. Therefore, we earnestly request Your Excellency to understand the situation and swiftly provide relief by allocating all the former Gongbu Bureau school properties and Japanese enemy school buildings to the municipal schools, to maintain education and cultivate the foundation of the nation. In urgent anticipation of your decision. Respectfully submitted by Jin Tongyin, Chen Baotai, Yang Minghui, Zhao Dingxin, Zhou Cheng, Dong Renjian, Zheng Zhifan, Tao Guangchuan, and other principals of Shanghai municipal middle schools.</p>
<h3>The Re-Erection of the Bronze Statue of the School Founder at Chengzhong Middle School in this City</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Since returning to its original address on Tangshan Road after the victory, Chengzhong Middle School in this city, through the joint efforts of the school board, alumni association, and current faculty and students, has made some progress in the past three months. However, due to the extensive damage, it is difficult to restore its former appearance in a short time. It is reported that the bronze statue of the school founder, which was stolen by Japanese ronin in the past, has recently been retrieved and will be re-erected.

<h3>Villagers in Qingtian County Oppose Jian Teacher Training School, Demolish the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall: Incident Originates from the Use of Skull Bones as Specimens</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou News] A conflict recently erupted between the Qingtian County Jian Teacher Training School in Zhejiang Province and the residents of Zhongyi Township, resulting in the demolition of the school's Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall by the residents. The details are as follows: The school has been using the Tianfei Temple in the county seat as its school building. Students previously found skull bones in the suburbs and used them as specimens for hygiene classes. When local villagers learned of this, they believed that the sacred Buddhist site had been defiled and sought to cause trouble for the school. On March 23rd, when over a thousand residents of Zhongyi Township returned the Buddha statues to Tianfei Temple, they demolished the school's Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, destroyed all the furnishings inside, and forced Principal Zhou of the school to restore Tianfei Temple to its original state and perform a Qingjiao Buddhist ceremony for three nights. Principal Zhou, under the threat of the crowd, had no choice but to comply and performed the Qingjiao ceremony for one night. Now, the school's student union believes that the school is a place for training teachers, and students are the teachers who enlighten the masses. In this era of scientific advancement, the foolish policies of religious superstition should be eradicated. Why should the school come forward, invite Taoist priests to perform a Qingjiao ceremony at the original site of the memorial hall, and be forced to take such absurd actions? This cannot be tolerated any longer. Therefore, the entire student body is opposed to it, no matter the cost. In addition to demanding that Principal Zhou refuse to fulfill the conditions accepted under duress, they have also petitioned the county government to prevent the recurrence of violent threats from the villagers. At the same time, they have sent petitions to the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Education Department, requesting them to immediately send telegrams to the county to provide protection and emphasize education. Yesterday, they also sent letters to the Hangzhou press, narrating the facts and requesting disclosure, urging all enlightened individuals to uphold justice. (Butterfly)</p>

<h3>Sales Not Strong, Rice Prices Still Rising, Sichuan Grain Shipped by Minsheng Steamship Company</h3>
<p>Yesterday, both arrival and sales in the rice market were not strong. Gengxian rice increased by over 1,000 yuan compared to yesterday. Baiyuan rice temporarily lacked fluctuations, but the closing felt weak. This is because the market price was too high after continuous increases, and the output from the stores decreased, so the flow of sales was reduced. In addition, foreign rice has already been ordered, totaling approximately 200,000 bags, causing people's minds to soften. Flour sales were sluggish, falling by 200-300 yuan. Wheat bran followed suit, decreasing by 200-300 yuan. The soybean cake market was also mediocre. Transactions in the wood street countryside were average, and guest gangs only handled small amounts. The arrival and departure of soybeans were both scarce, and the market was stable. Red beans were scarce, and the price increased by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Corn from Nanyang remained unchanged, and a small amount from Qingdao in the north was handled. The market was stable. Red sorghum was active in sales due to the rising price of liquor, increasing by another 1,000 yuan. Due to the surge of goods from Qingdao, the oil market was unable to rise and was weak. According to rice market news yesterday, a total of over 5,000 shi of seven types of rice arrived in the city, including 3,436 shi of Baijing rice, 465 shi of thin rice, 62 shi of early rice, 45 shi of Yangxian rice, 540 shi of Duxian rice, 75 shi of Baiyuan rice, and 15 shi of Yinyuan rice.</p>
<p>According to news from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, it has been decided to use all of the passenger ships of the Minsheng Industrial Company to ship the stored grain from Sichuan. Passengers will be carried as usual. If the amount of cargo increases, the number of passengers and their luggage will be restricted.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Transactions Scarce, Fabric Market Relatively Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was weak and sales were slow. The Tianjin and Guangdong customer groups had very little appetite, so 20-count yarn decreased by around 20,000. Transactions of 42-count double-strand yarn were lively. Pure weaving factories also absorbed some, so the price was able to maintain the 2 million mark. At noon, Fangjian opened yarn as usual, offering 20-count Zhiyunpeng and Shuangnv brands. Although there was a Baoguang brand of 42-count yarn listed at 1.95 million, it was limited to lingerie and dyeing factories, so yarn merchants and knitting and cotton weaving factories could only sigh and were unable to purchase it. In addition, seven types of yarn were put up for tender, and it was reported that six companies, including Zhendachang, Shunfeng, Rongyang, Hengxing, Shuixing, and Zhenfengchang, won the bids. The bid prices were as follows: 1.88 million for 42-count Jiuyu, 1.975 million for 42-count unbranded, 2.02 million for 42-count Riguang, 1.67 million for 32-count Yanghe, 1.835 million for 40-count Riguang, 2.38 million for 60-count Yanghe cone yarn, and 1.66 million for 40-count Caiwuzi.</p>
<p>The fabric market was more stable than yarn prices. Most varieties were comparable. Twelve-pound fine cloth, Chuji Shilin, and gray oblique cloth were more popular. In the cotton market, New York American cotton fell by 9 to 18 points, with recent US dollars at 27.17, forward at 27.77, and Miterlin spot at 27.97. The current cotton market in this port is still strong, but transactions are still scarce. Only the Suzhou Sulun Yarn Factory had some transactions.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Slightly Weaker, Stocks Weakly Lower</h3>
<p>After some large investors in public bonds took profits, the market lacked excitement yesterday. At the opening, Category C bonds had already fallen slightly to around 7,150 yuan. Floating shorts were slightly replenished, and after the opening, they once rose to over 7,400 yuan. However, there were more sales again, and the price fell to around 6,850 yuan, causing short positions to cover their profits. Before noon, the price rose again to around 7,300 yuan, and the overall situation turned sideways. As a result, the closing was slightly weaker by 100 yuan compared to the previous day. Miscellaneous brands fell more because of the earlier closing time, with Categories A and B down 350, and Categories D and E down 300 yuan. Retail investors and floating capital in Chinese stocks are eagerly seeking to retreat, and large investors are waiting for opportunities. The market is devoid of stimulation. Since the opening, all stocks have gradually weakened. The process was quiet, and the situation was slightly calmer after noon. As a result, the two most popular stocks continued to decline slightly compared to the previous closing, and Jingfu and Xinguang fell by about 5%. Qinxing, on the other hand, saw a slight increase. Other stocks also declined slightly. Foreign stocks were unfavorable and fell slightly again. Yisha fell from 12,600 yuan to around 12,100 yuan before slightly recovering. Other stocks saw lower prices, with the continued decline about average compared to the previous closing.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Active, Industry Players Buying Yushan Fried Green Tea</h3>
<p>Recently, wood street stores, seeing that the price of fried green tea produced in Yushan, Jiangxi, is still relatively reasonable, have been showing interest. Traders are offering around 30,000 yuan per dan. In Hangzhou, merchants from Tianjin and Nanjing are frequently purchasing Xinqi tea in the production area, so people in this city are becoming firmer and reluctant to sell, and the supply is becoming tighter. The supply and demand for aged tea are equal, and there is little change. As for needle-like eyebrow green tea exclusively sold to Morocco in Africa, the British Jardine Matheson is still very interested, and holders are taking the opportunity to sell, pushing the market forward again.</p>
<h3>Floating Long Positions Gradually Liquidating, Gold Prices Continue to Fall, US Dollars Also Affected</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the long position in gold collapsed. The market opened lower in the morning, and floating longs gradually liquidated from 1.78 million after the opening. Around 10:00, it fell below 1.74 million and struggled. The Bank of China distributed over 100 taels to the industry, and after several rounds of negotiation, a compromise price of 1.735 million was set. Afterwards, buyers lost interest, and the 1.7 million mark was finally broken at noon. In the afternoon, floating longs were cleared, and money was loose. After falling, it slightly recovered, and finally hovered below 1.75 million. As a result, it continued to fall by 30,000. Decorative gold was 186,000, and shredded silver and silver dollars were flat. The implied interest rate was slightly lower due to loose money, from 1.5 to 1.8 cents.</p>
<p>Foreign currency US dollars were affected by the gold market and decreased slightly. After opening at 2,300 in the morning, they gradually decreased to below 2,250 yuan, and then stabilized slightly. In the afternoon, the gold market stabilized slightly, and there were continued purchases of US dollars, rising to around 2,270 yuan, but it ultimately failed to surpass the morning opening price. As a result, it fell slightly by 10 yuan. Hong Kong dollars were stable, and the buying and selling prices were slightly separated, similar to the previous day. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 45 yuan, and the Robbie exchange rate was 520 yuan, with limited transactions.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Goods at 700 Million, Promoting Silkworm Cocoon Baking Cooperatives, Undertaking Loan for Stove Repair Costs</h3>
<p>With the silk cocoon season approaching, the Shanghai branch of the Small Farmers Bank is holding mortgage loans worth 700 million yuan in various counties of Jiangsu Province. The cost for farmers to raise silkworms this year is estimated to be the equivalent of 5 dan of rice for 1 dan of fresh cocoons, and the price is unlikely to increase. The Shanghai branch of the Central Farmers Bank, in conjunction with the Wuxi Silkworm Breeding Improvement Zone, is organizing silkworm cocoon baking cooperatives to bake and sell cocoons together. The bank has sent special personnel to each county to promote the business of handling cooperative mortgage loans. All members can apply for loans from the Farmers Bank, using the dried fresh cocoons stored in the Farmers Bank or in warehouses designated by the Farmers Bank as collateral for the loan. If a member's existing furnace needs to be repaired, they can also apply to the Farmers Bank for a reasonable amount of repair costs, calculated based on the amount of cocoons received, for a term of two years, with a monthly interest rate of 4%. It is reported that the silkworm cocoon baking cooperative business is being promoted, and a meeting of silkworm farmers is scheduled to be held in Wuxi on the 15th to estimate the actual amount of loans required.</p>
<h3>Silk Slightly Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, silk was slightly weaker again. The factory silk's high uniformity asking price did not decrease, but foreign firms were unwilling to absorb it, so there were no transactions. Users' high-grade short silk fell by around 50,000 yuan, and dried warp yarn fell by around 20,000-30,000 yuan. 120-count Tianqiao brand rayon opened at 1.38 million, and closed at 1.35 million and 1.36 million, down 20,000 yuan from the previous day. The remaining types were at the same price as the previous day or down 20,000-30,000 yuan. Silk fabrics continued to show weakness. Meiya quilt covers fell by 40,000-50,000 yuan per 100 pieces, and Dacheng lattice fabric fell by 100 yuan per piece.</p>
<h3>Saving to Relieve Famine, US Bans Wheat for Liquor</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] Agriculture Secretary Anderson announced today that he will continue to restrict the waste of domestic wheat, restrict the milling of wheat into flour for domestic consumption, and ban the use of wheat for brewing beer and whiskey until June of next year in order to relieve famine abroad. The United States should provide at least 250 million bushels of wheat to famine-stricken areas. The current automatic wheat conservation plan will remain in effect, and the use of wheat as livestock feed will be further restricted. The government will requisition a quarter of the wheat purchased from warehouses and merchants for export. Farmers must sell at least half of the wheat they bring into warehouses for storage.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cloth Arrives in a Steady Stream, Private Textile Factories Request Staff Reduction</h3>
<p>Recently, a large quantity of cotton cloth from Mexico has been shipped to Shanghai, and it is being sold by the China Textile Corporation. Its price is lower than that of the Shanghai factories, and the quality is excellent. It is reported that a large quantity will continue to arrive this month and will continue to be sold on the market. It is expected that cotton cloth prices will continue to decline. Recently, private textile factories in this city have requested permission from the authorities to reduce staff because their products are selling poorly, and their production costs are too high to compete with foreign goods.</p>
<h3>British Car Prices Increase</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] British car and commercial vehicle prices are rising due to rising wages and materials costs. Yesterday, officials from the Austin Motor Company announced that the company's car prices have increased by 6% to 11%. Other manufacturers have also generally increased the average price of vehicle models by 6.5%. British manufacturers can automatically increase prices and need only consult with the government beforehand, unlike the United States, which must first obtain the approval of the Price Management Bureau.</p>
<h3>Sharp Retreat of Sugar Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market suddenly retreated due to rumors of a large amount of goods arriving and the establishment of a new company. The initial price of white sugar at the Sugar Association in the morning was 65,000 yuan, a drop of 3,000 yuan. It then fell slightly to 64,500 yuan to 4,000 yuan. In the afternoon, it fell further to 63,000 yuan, a drop of 5,000 yuan. Other types of sugar also fell accordingly. Three and a half vehicle white sugar was 67,000 yuan, and raw sugar was 55,000 yuan. There were only scattered transactions. Yuanzhou white sugar opened at 70,000 yuan, but no wholesale transactions were made.</p>
<h3>US Actively Storing Hog Bristles, to be Sold by the War Assets Administration</h3>
<p>The US government accumulated a large quantity of hog bristles from Chongqing and Calcutta during the war and has now declared them surplus materials. They will soon be sold by the War Assets Administration within a few months. The amount of hog bristles in storage is currently being kept secret, but the business community estimates that it is over one million pounds.</p>
<h3>Shortage of Flannel Inventory</h3>
<p>Sales of woolen fabrics remained limited yesterday. However, due to internal market buying, prices slightly increased. Gray flannel for Western-style clothing had some transactions, and inventory is extremely scarce. Timely sales have led to demand exceeding supply. Furthermore, due to the lack of Western goods and Renli Tianma brand fabrics, there's an opportunity for lower-end goods from Zhenfeng and Gongda to sell well. Yesterday, Zhenfeng flannel sold for 40,000 yuan, Gongda old stock for 35,000 yuan, new stock for 30,000 yuan, and miscellaneous brands sold for 27,000 to 28,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Japan's Import and Export Trade Under the Full Control of MacArthur</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 15th dispatch: The U.S. State Department recently announced that control over Japan's import and export affairs is the full responsibility of General MacArthur, the Supreme Commander in Japan. All goods exported to the U.S. must be distributed by a commercial company managed by U.S. officials [a subsidiary of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation]. Regarding international trade matters, informal consultations will also be held with other countries in the shortest possible time. It is understood that Japan's main exports this year are raw silk, cotton textiles, tin, antimony, rubber, tea, silk, etc., which will be supplied to countries urgently in need of these goods.</p>
<h3>Rice Surplus Reaches Over 3 Million Tons; U.S. and Britain Order from Allied Headquarters; Overseas Chinese Raise Funds to Relieve Famine</h3>
<p>Siam, known as the granary of the Far East, had an average annual rice export volume of 1,546,124 tons from 1934 to 1938. Since the outbreak of the European War in 1939 and the Japanese landing and occupation in 1941 until 1945, rice exports from Siam were limited due to the intense European and Asian wars and international transportation obstacles. The accumulated rice over these five years is estimated to total 7.5 million tons, according to unofficial statistics. During the Japanese occupation, about 2 million tons were privately transported out by the Japanese army over five years. Flooding in central Siam in 1941 and the spring drought this year resulted in losses of over 1 million tons. This year's rice export volume is estimated to be no less than 3.5 million tons based on accumulated reserves. When Siam fell to the enemy, railways and highways were severely damaged. Currently, domestic transportation and fuel are in short supply. Although the Allied Headquarters has continuously provided assistance, it is still insufficient. The main transportation lines are currently being repaired by Japanese prisoners, but due to a lack of materials, it cannot be remedied in the short term. Therefore, transporting Siamese rice from the interior to the coast is a major challenge. Siam hopes that the United Nations can provide more transportation equipment to facilitate early recovery and food transportation.</p>
<p>It is also reported that after British forces took control of Siam, the government issued a new order restricting the export of four materials: rice, rubber, tin, and teak. Since the victory, statistics show that the Siamese government has donated 200,000 tons of rice to Britain for free to cover the costs of British occupation. Britain has also purchased over 1.2 million *qian* (a unit of weight) of rice from Siam at a price. Currently, both British and American units in Siam are ordering rice from a Siamese government-private joint rice purchasing company on behalf of the Allied Headquarters. The stipulated purchase price is 65 baht (Siamese currency) per 100 *jin* (equivalent to 120 *jin* in Shanghai) for top-quality rice and 35 baht for second-quality rice (each baht is worth 185 legal currency). It is reported that over 100,000 tons have already been purchased.</p>
<p>Mr. Zheng Wulou, Chairman of the Siam Overseas Chinese Relief Committee for the Motherland's Famine, which was formed by overseas Chinese in Siam, took the opportunity of returning to China to attend the National Congress to negotiate with the government on shipping rice back to China for famine relief. It is reported that principles have been agreed upon. If the British and Siamese authorities continue to restrict our purchase and transportation, the 3 million overseas Chinese in Siam plan to launch a food-saving campaign to spare grain for the motherland's famine. According to Zheng, this approach will not affect Siamese rice consumption and should be adopted by the British and Siamese authorities. Zheng also stated that since its establishment last year, the committee has planned to raise 20 million baht to purchase rice to relieve the famine in the motherland. It has already raised over 10 million baht and purchased over 7,400 tons of rice, which has been shipped back to the motherland in three batches since March 15th this year and has been handed over to Guangdong Province for relief. Fundraising is still ongoing, with the goal of raising 20 million baht.</p>
<h3>High Production Costs: A Fatal Blow to Export Industry; Domestic Prices Exceed Foreign Prices; Labor and Interest Burdens Are Not Light; Raising Exchange Rates Is Definitely Not a Good Strategy</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) To understand the current situation of the export industry in Shanghai, a reporter visited Mr. Zhang Huanzhang, Chairman of the Shanghai Import and Export Chamber of Commerce. According to him, domestic production costs have been increasing recently. Among China's exports, apart from machine-made products that cannot compete with foreign products, even handicrafts cannot be developed. The reasons are nothing more than: (1) High wages. It is said that the work efficiency of Chinese workers requires three people to equal one foreign worker. However, the current wage level in China has exceeded that of foreign countries. Therefore, China, which was known for its low labor costs, has even fallen behind in this innate advantage, let alone others. (2) Stagnant domestic transportation and high freight costs indirectly increase the cost of exports. (3) High interest rates. Hidden interest rates are often around 20%. If ordinary exports are left in Shanghai for a month, the loss of interest and the additional rent together increase the export cost by 30% per month. Therefore, the trend of exports and general prices is still upward, while the U.S. raw silk market has recently been declining. Exporters are invisibly attacked from both sides and are at a loss. The reporter then inquired whether some people's suggestion to raise the current official exchange rate would help the export industry. He said that raising the exchange rate would not solve the current difficulties of the export industry. Once the exchange rate is raised, general prices will inevitably follow, resulting in export costs not only failing to decrease but instead increasing due to the general rise in prices, which is definitely not a good strategy. Zhang also suggested that the Central Bank should strive to stabilize the price of gold supply, preferably without fluctuating with the market, so as not to be exploited by speculators. Finally, he said that the current situation of the export industry in Shanghai is one of complete helplessness. Even if the government is called upon for relief, the government will feel there is no way to start. The fundamental solution lies in making every effort to reduce production costs so that exports can compete in the international market. If this problem can be solved, other minor problems will be easily resolved. Zhang then stated that the Shanghai Import and Export Chamber of Commerce has 400 to 500 members, but less than 1% are actually engaged in export business. Most of the others are engaged in import business. However, most of the imports are consumer goods. He cited the price list of export goods recently sent from the United States as an example: leather shoes ranging from US$3.40 to US$5 per pair, felt hats ranging from US$3 to US$6 per piece, new woolen suits (three pieces) ranging from US$45 to US$50 per set, women's spring coats ranging from US$24 to US$34 per piece, etc. The above prices are retail prices, and the quality of each item is selected to be the best. If we take the prices of shoes and clothing in the United States, they are not enough to cover labor costs in China, let alone raw materials. Recently, due to the undesirable production conditions in Shanghai, the U.S. company Weili Han has planned to move to Hong Kong, and the British-American Tobacco Company also intends to move to Japan to start production. Therefore, to improve the production conditions in Shanghai, it is essential to reduce production costs first.</p>

<h3>General Du Yuming in the Flames of War - Reported on the 13th by Our Newspaper - Special Dispatch from Reporter Zhao Haosheng from Nanjing</h3>
<p>Looking towards the Northeast, I miss General Du Yuming.</p>
<p>Time has not diminished my memory of General Du. I saw General Du in Chongqing as far back as half a year ago, when he had just been appointed as the Commander of the Northeast Security Headquarters and was preparing to depart in a day or two. At that time, the chairmen and mayors of the nine provinces and two cities in the Northeast, as well as Mr. Liu Zhe, the director of the Changchun Railway, were present. They were giving General Du a farewell dinner and exchanging views on the security issues in the Northeast.</p>
<p>First Impression</p>
<p>General Du arrived ten minutes before the agreed time. He was wearing a grass-green woolen military uniform, and the first impression he gave was that he was energetic, robust, and full of vitality. He was not tall, nor did he have the general-type stoutness. His face was plain, but his eyebrows were sharp, and the light in his eyes and the muscles at the corners of his mouth fully showed the tension peculiar to a soldier. General Du's appearance, his thoughts, and his courage were all a concrete manifestation of "power." He greeted everyone with his pure Shaanxi dialect, which sounded simple and homely and was completely in harmony with General Du's personality.</p>
<p>Every Northeasterner present expressed their welcome and good fortune that General Du had been sent to the Northeast.</p>
<p>The Victorious General</p>
<p>Bishop Yu Bin called General Du "the victorious general." During the conversation, everyone had a few suggestions for General Du: first, because the Northeast had suffered the longest, they hoped that General Du would provide more comfort and use less force after the overall victory; second, because people from Guannei (inside the passes) were relatively unfamiliar with the Northeast, they needed people familiar with the local situation to assist in the implementation of relief work, so they hoped that General Du would employ more Northeasterners under his command.</p>
<p>The National Army Is the Motherland</p>
<p>General Du said that he went to the Northeast entirely with a service mentality. He hoped to get assistance and guidance from the people of the Northeast. He deeply felt the arduousness of this mission. When talking about military-civilian cooperation, he said that in the eyes of a commander, as long as there were disputes between the military and civilians, regardless of who was at fault, the soldiers should be punished. He repeatedly emphasized that the responsibilities of the National Army in the Northeast, both psychologically for the people and in terms of practical tasks, were extremely arduous. The people of the Northeast saw the National Army as seeing the motherland. The National Army should bring happiness and stability to the compatriots in the Northeast who had lived in suffering for fourteen years. General Du's words were sincere, and they were extremely touching in the absence of any embellished rhetoric.</p>
<p>New Heroic Epic</p>
<p>The elderly told General Du about the climate in the Northeast and hoped that he would prepare winter clothing for the soldiers early. Young people hoped that General Du could write a heroic epic in the Northeast that could be passed down for generations. The atmosphere at that time was like a family sitting together, chatting intimately. No one imagined, and no one wanted to imagine, that the Northeast would evolve into the chaotic situation it is in today.</p>
<p>General Du's Efforts</p>
<p>A beautiful dream of peace and stability has turned into a tragic nightmare. Just as the reporter once heard Mr. Liu Zhe talk about his feelings about Changchun in Chongqing: "Being trapped in Changchun is like standing at the door of your home but not being able to go in. There is nothing more cruel in the world."</p>
<p>Half a year ago, General Du Yuming went to the Northeast with the hopes and dreams of the people of the Northeast. Today, General Du Yuming is fighting for the realization of the hopes and dreams of millions of people in this chaotic situation. Looking towards the Northeast, I miss General Du Yuming, the general galloping through the flames of war.</p>

<h3>How to Eradicate Opium? - Zhu Zonghai</h3>
<p>Opium contains narcotic properties, and anyone who becomes addicted finds it difficult to extricate themselves. Morphine, cocaine, heroin, and other narcotics are even more harmful than opium. Our national government promulgated the "Provisional Regulations for Punishing Opium and Drug Offenses" on February 19, 1941, as a special criminal law to punish those who violate opium and drug bans. Since the implementation of the "Morphine Punishment Law" in 1914, various opium prohibition laws, "Provisional Regulations for Strictly Prohibiting Highly Addictive Drugs," "Provisional Regulations for Punishing Opium Offenses," and "Provisional Regulations for Punishing Drug Offenses" have been promulgated, up to the current "Provisional Regulations for Punishing Opium and Drug Offenses." The process has taken over 20 years, which cannot be considered short. The punishments range from death or life imprisonment to imprisonment for more than one year, which cannot be considered lenient. Despite such strict laws and severe punishments, the opium ban has been in place for over 20 years, but it still cannot be eradicated, and the number of opium addicts has increased rather than decreased. Is it really that people are not afraid of death and enjoy it, or is there something to reflect on in the implementation of the opium prohibition policy?</p>
<p>The crime of opium is different from ordinary crimes. For ordinary crimes, such as murder, robbery, theft, and other offenses, the state enacts strict laws and diligently apprehends offenders. Those who have committed crimes are imprisoned, and those who have not committed crimes are deterred. This is sufficient to achieve the effect of punishment. However, this is not the case for opium offenses. The amount of opium smoked increases over time, and the addiction grows stronger over time. The bodies of addicts are harmed by opium, and symptoms such as constipation, insomnia, tremors, reduced appetite, and mental depression appear. If their addiction is not satisfied, symptoms such as vomiting, tearing, runny nose, and palpitations will worsen, and some may even die from withdrawal. Therefore, ordinary criminals only need to be imprisoned, deprived of their freedom, and educated to develop a sense of repentance and reform. This is the expertise of prison scholars. However, simply imprisoning opium addicts without providing them with detoxification drugs is tantamount to putting them to death. Therefore, for opium addicts, medical treatment is more important than imprisonment, and rehabilitation is better than punishment. The ultimate goal of the national opium prohibition policy is to help smokers quit, prevent non-smokers from developing this habit, and improve the health of the nation. However, everyone is lazy, especially opium addicts. Without external pressure, few are willing to endure the pain of detoxification and commit to quitting. To enable addicts to commit to quitting, widespread detoxification hospitals and detoxification drugs are needed. However, hoping is not enough and is of no practical use. Establishing such widespread detoxification hospitals faces both manpower and financial difficulties. Shanghai is a concentrated area for opium addicts. Recently, a large number of addicts have been arrested, and prisons are overcrowded, while the lack of detoxification hospitals remains the same. If Shanghai is like this, the situation in other places can be imagined. If the national opium prohibition policy continues on this path, it will probably be difficult to eradicate opium even after another 20 years. For example, if there are 100,000 opium addicts in Shanghai, is there a prison that can accommodate 100,000 people? Since there is no prison that can accommodate 100,000 people, it is impossible to imprison all 100,000 addicts. Therefore, among the addicts, some are lucky and some are unlucky; some are arrested and some are not. Once arrested, the prison is unable to accommodate everyone and has to release them on bail. In this way, arresting and releasing at the same time, treating opium offenders as ordinary criminals, imprisoning and punishing them, but failing to provide them with medical treatment and rehabilitation. Inevitably, addicted smokers cannot quit, and non-smoking compatriots, seeing that there are still many smokers in society, believe that it is harmless to develop this bad habit. They start by playing around and then become addicted. How can this achieve the effect of eradication? Therefore, I propose to supplement the opium prohibition policy with criminal policy and formulate the following implementation plan:</p>
<p>1.  Opium offenders who have been arrested and who are genuinely willing to quit and can afford the detoxification expenses should be allowed to provide reliable guarantors, designate a hospital, and set a time limit for quitting. Those who fail to quit within the time limit should be severely punished within the scope of the statutory penalty to deter those who are playing games.</p>
<p>2.  Impoverished opium offenders who have been arrested should be sent to public detoxification hospitals for free rehabilitation.</p>
<p>3.  Opium addicts who have not been discovered but have entered hospitals for detoxification should not be arrested because they are taking detoxification medicine in the hospital instead of smoking opium. This allows them to follow through with their commitment to quit. After they quit and are discharged from the hospital, this point can be interpreted in two ways in law: (a) Opium addicts who have not registered by the end of March are in violation of the "Provisional Regulations for Punishing Opium and Drug Offenses," regardless of whether they have entered a hospital for detoxification, and should be arrested. (b) Since they have entered a hospital for detoxification, what they are inhaling is detoxification medicine and not opium. To implement the national opium prohibition policy, they should be allowed to reform and should not be arrested again to interfere with their good intentions to quit. I prefer the latter interpretation.</p>
<p>4.  Where does the opium that addicts smoke come from? It is obtained from four types of people: those who grow opium, those who manufacture opium, those who traffic opium, and those who run opium dens. If the above four types of opium offenders are severely punished, the source of opium can be cut off, and the actual effect of opium prohibition can be quickly achieved.</p>
<p>5.  According to Article 8 of the "Post-Purification Opium Suppression Measures" promulgated by the Executive Yuan, "Autonomous organizations, social groups, and public-spirited individuals should jointly organize an Opium Prohibition Association to assist in propaganda, reporting, rehabilitation, and relief." Shanghai should organize this Opium Prohibition Association, raise funds from society, and establish widespread detoxification hospitals, or solicit large donations directly from wealthy opium addicts with status. In short, since the national treasury cannot afford this huge detoxification expense, and the government is determined to eradicate opium, we cannot bear to see a large number of opium addicts die in prison due to the lack of detoxification drugs. Soliciting donations from opium addicts will inevitably lead to abuses and be criticized. However, when choosing between two evils, it is better to choose the lesser evil. It is better to donate a few more dollars so that more people can quit opium.</p>
<p>The above points are my opinions expressed from the standpoint of a citizen and are not related to my current position as a public official. I hereby declare this jointly.</p>
<h3>The First Voice of Democracy in Hangzhou: A Quick Sketch of the Municipal Assembly Election Scene</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng, Hangzhou Correspondence from This Newspaper, 12th</p>
<p>Following Shanghai's election of municipal assembly members, Hangzhou City also elected its municipal assembly members on May 12th. Half a month before the election, this reporter interviewed the person in charge of the Municipal Provisional Assembly to ask for their opinion on this municipal assembly election. They said, "Hangzhou cannot be compared to Shanghai. Shanghai is vigorous, but Hangzhou is always calm and steady."</p>
<p>Campaign Activities: Not Enthusiastic Enough</p>
<p>The government announced a total of 114 candidates from various regions and professional groups. The number of regularly elected formal and alternate municipal assembly members was 84, which meant there were fewer than two candidates for each seat. However, according to what this reporter knows, there were quite a few people lobbying and socializing behind the scenes, but they rarely gave public speeches to the citizens or boldly announced their views on municipal construction. Only in the two days before the election did some candidates host a press conference. They particularly emphasized the reasons why Hangzhou was not enthusiastic enough, saying that it represented perseverance and simplicity. At that time, they put forward their proposals, which included the need for housing, good roads to travel on, attention to hygiene, and promotion of domestic goods. Some even attacked other candidates, claiming to represent a certain sector.</p>
<p>After the candidates' tea party, Hangzhou Mayor Zhou Xiangxian also held a tea party to entertain the press. During the meeting, he explained the election law. Someone said, "We haven't received our citizen certificates yet." Zhou took out an identity card from his suit pocket and said, "I have already received mine." The person in charge of education in the municipal government, after explaining the election of the Educational Association, added, "If I vote, I will definitely vote for so-and-so."</p>
<p>Citizen certificates were rarely processed in the few days prior to the election. My office is on Qingtai Road. Some citizen certificates in the Qingtai Road area were only received on the eve of the election. At a certain residence on Xiaxi Street, the household registration had already been investigated and completed, but they had not received their citizen certificates on the day of the election. Citizen certificates were printed on small pieces of white newsprint. Everything was printed on it, only the citizen's name and residence information were written in, along with the date of issuance. In Hangzhou's election of representatives of public opinion organs, the most enthusiastic performance was by the press. For nearly a week, newspapers promoted the candidates daily, but some newspapers slightly favored the promotion of certain candidates, which was barely noticeable. On the eve of the election, Mr. Wu Wangji, the president of Zheng Bao, initiated the organization of a municipal assembly election reporter tour. The next day, a jeep was borrowed, and reporters from various newspapers who volunteered to go could gather and set off. Participating newspapers included Southeast Daily, Zhejiang Daily, Datong Daily, and Zheng Bao. This reporter was also invited to participate. First, we went to the Municipal Farmers' Association. Professional groups elected through initial election representatives. The election method was to elect one person in the first round, requiring more than half the votes, and the next highest vote-getter would be the alternate. However, the first alternate could still be elected in the second round. We arrived at the Farmers' Association and saw many farmers sitting on benches listening to explanations of the election methods. Later, we went to the first district polling station in Tongcheng Temple. District elections are direct universal suffrage, where people go directly to vote, and the majority wins the election, with the next highest vote-getter as the alternate. However, Tongcheng Temple did not seem very enthusiastic. Coming out of Tongcheng Temple, we drove to Nanxing Bridge, seeing the dilapidated houses burned and destroyed by the enemy, and thinking about how the people have gained sovereignty today, we were truly overjoyed. Arriving at the polling station, a sign was posted at the entrance saying, "Those who are not voting are not allowed to enter." Inside the ballot distribution point, many farmers from the fields crowded around, some very young, some holding babies, and some elderly ladies over sixty years old. It was quite enthusiastic. One candidate was speaking loudly, saying, "The district chief wants to get elected himself, so he personally distributes citizen certificates."</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers and Tea Servers: Representatives of Public Opinion</p>
<p>We went to the Chamber of Commerce, where they had already finished the election, and who was elected had already been announced. One of the elected alternates was laughing heartily. After all, they were all business tycoons, so there was a lot of courtesy and deference. Later, we hurried to the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. They had already elected their representatives. We heard that one of them was a tea server, and another was a rickshaw puller, which are truly representatives of public opinion. Then we went to Huixing Middle School, which was one of the polling stations in the second district. Director Ruan had already come to vote. In the corner of the classroom, someone was writing intently. I went over to take a look and realized they were rushing to write out "citizen certificates." We also went to Hongdao Elementary School, where a clerk was dozing off. The director of the polling station said, "The voting situation hasn't reached the saturation point yet."</p>
<p>Which One to Choose? Choose the First One</p>
<p>We crossed several roads and thought about going to East Street Road to see the third district election. We asked a policeman, but the policeman didn't know anything about the polling station. It was the same as "asking a policeman in Nanxing Bridge where the election was and the policeman saying he didn't know." In the end, a primary school student led us to East Street Road Central Elementary School. We saw many women voting. The ballot writer asked which one they wanted to choose. The women said, "Choose the first one." The first one was the district chief's name. Walking out of the elementary school gate, many people told us that a certain lawyer had posted a red paper strip on the gate of Central Elementary School, writing: "Vote for so-and-so today." We were ashamed of his usual behavior, so it was torn off.</p>
<p>We proceeded to the free professions' polling station, which had also concluded. Lawyer So-and-so and pharmacist So-and-so were elected as formal assembly members, and journalist So-and-so was elected as an alternate.</p>
<p>Circling around the lakeside and climbing onto Broken Bridge, we went to the Zuo Jiang Er Gong Temple on the outer West Lake. In the morning, a reporter told us that there had been some minor disturbances there. When we arrived, the disturbances were gone. We heard that Mayor Zhou had also come to vote. Bamboo poles were used to create entrances and exits to maintain order. One account of the morning's disturbances said that it was caused by a slight delay in issuing ballots. Another account said that someone had obtained twenty-four citizen certificates and exchanged them for thirty-five ballots, which caused the dispute.</p>
<p>Circling around Su Causeway, we listed the polling station near Jingci Temple. There, the people were still enthusiastically voting. When we arrived, the staff appeared particularly nervous. Someone went to vote, and we asked him which one he was going to choose. He said, "I don't know." The clerk read out the names to him, emphasizing "so-and-so" when he got to that name. The voter then seemed to realize and chose "so-and-so."</p>
<p>Intellectuals Are After All Different</p>
<p>Coming out of Jingci Temple, I felt extraordinarily emotional. I turned to the Provincial People's Education Museum by the lake to see the election of the Educational Association, which was a direct election and was handled in an orderly manner and on a large scale. Intellectuals are different after all.</p>
<p>On the way back, we thought that this was the first time after all, and that even if there were some mistakes, they should be forgiven. However, once we know the mistakes, we should correct them immediately. For example, the delayed issuance of citizen certificates and the lack of caution on the part of the ballot writers can all serve as lessons for the next election. At the same time, the candidates in this election were not enthusiastic enough. Even though the candidates exaggerated that Hangzhou was "sincere, simple, calm and steady," they should raise the importance of their own rights and political interest to the highest degree. The speeches made by the candidates also lacked stimulating content. We hope that there will be more and more candidates, and more and more voters. The more there are, the higher the understanding of democracy will be. If we are afraid of enthusiasm causing trouble and only want the election to pass "peacefully," then that is not right.</p>
<p>I heard that several well-learned scholars were not elected this time, and that Li Peien, the vice chairman of the Provisional Assembly and president of Zhijiang University, was only elected as an alternate. These are all things that need special attention.</p>
<h3>Plague Invades Zhuji</h3>
<p>— Feicun, Zhuji Correspondence, 5th</p>
<p>Besides food causing panic here, the plague is threatening people's lives. In this post-eight-year war situation, people's livelihoods are still not guaranteed. Black news is continuously coming from the countryside, first the Black Death, meningitis, followed by smallpox, etc. Smallpox has already taken the lives of many lively children, and even adults have died from it. Especially in schools, the contagiousness of the disease is even greater. Almost every school has students "absent due to smallpox." In one particular bao school, half of the fifty students have contracted smallpox.</p>
<p>Newspapers are shouting almost every day, "Pay attention to the plague!" But the health authorities are too poor and cannot bear the responsibility. They can only save one side while neglecting the other, resulting in a completely unmanaged situation. Human power is clearly unable to extinguish it. To the villagers, everyone can only beg for blessings from the gods. Various villages are holding grand welcome ceremonies for the gods to ask for protection. Some opportunistic elements who do not do honest work are taking advantage of this situation to profit from the chaos, using festival competitions as an excuse to perform plays and gamble, ultimately leaving the villagers impoverished, while the plague god still bares its fangs and claws, demanding lives. Speaking of which, this is quite tragic. For the sake of festival competitions and asking for the protection of the bodhisattva, apportioned donations are being universally enforced.</p>
<h3>Loyal, Ardent and Brave: Martyr General Zhang Zizhong</h3>
<p>— Pingzhai</p>
<p>When Yin Rugeng was organizing a puppet regime in eastern Hebei, I was studying in Beijing. At that time, the defense of the Beijing-Tianjin area was entirely the responsibility of General Song Mingxuan of the Twenty-ninth Army. Next to the majestic and solid walls of Beijing, the brave soldiers of the Twenty-ninth Army stood quietly, among the weeds growing on the parapets. The harsh north wind carried the yellow sand of the North China Plain, blowing their thin gray cloth uniforms, blowing the red tassels on the handles of the broadswords on their backs.</p>
<p>The people felt a little more at ease. Although Wangfujing Street was filled with staggering Japanese soldiers, although the streets and alleys were filled with white-faced shops run by Koreans, and although corpses of unknown cause often floated on the Hai River, everyone clearly remembered that the Twenty-ninth Army were the heroes of Gubeikou and Xifengkou. Those shining blades had once been dipped in the blood of countless Japanese soldiers! However, the situation was getting worse and worse. Patriotic students were repeatedly arrested. "Independent Review" was ordered to cease publication because it published an article opposing the special status of North China. The author of that article, Professor Zhang Xiruo, was ordered to be arrested. The slogan "Down with Japanese Imperialism" became the most dangerous taboo.</p>
<p>Only Qin Decun spoke passionately and generously to everyone, saying, "I, Qin, will never sell out the country!"</p>
<p>Everyone else kept an embarrassing silence.</p>
<p>Finally, the Anti-Japanese War began at the beautiful Lugou Bridge! The people of all of China roared for resistance against Japan, and the mountains and hills of all of China echoed with earth-shattering sounds: Resist Japan! However, who knew that Zhang Zizhong did not leave!</p>
<p>Could it be that this hero who fought to the death at Xifengkou had changed his mind?</p>
<p>On the sixth anniversary of General Zhang's martyrdom, recalling the thoughts at that time, I feel infinitely ashamed and infinitely regretful! I should quote Chairman Jiang's comment on General Zhang: "He is not disturbed by the rights and wrongs and praises and criticisms of the world, this is the mind of an ancient minister planning for the country, which is not something that ordinary people can understand, nor is it something that ordinary people can undertake!" Who knew? At that time, General Zhang had already left a will, ready to die for the country!</p>
<p>When the all-out war of resistance began, General Zhang finally secretly sailed across the sea and arrived in the capital. Chairman Jiang knew his painstaking efforts and resolutely appointed him as the commander of the Fifty-ninth Army. In February of the 27th year, he reinforced the Huaihe front, and made several fierce counterattacks, recovering many strongholds, causing the enemy to suffer the first setback at a time when their fierce flames were spreading. In March of the same year, the enemy's most elite "iron cavalry" Itagaki Division pounced on Linyi, preparing to enter He'erzhuang and invade Xuzhou. General Zhang was ordered to rush to the aid day and night, traveling one hundred and eighty li in one day! After seven days and nights of fierce fighting, the enemy's planes, artillery, and tanks densely bombed, but General Zhang personally commanded the machine guns amidst the hail of bullets and rushed</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second phase of the War of Resistance, General Zhang was the commander-in-chief of the Thirty-third Group Army and the commander-in-chief of the right-wing corps of the Fifth War Zone, stationed in Jingmen, permanently protecting Xiangfan, and completed the victories of southern Henan and northern Hubei three times, until the 29th year of the Republic of China, when the enemy dared not look west.</p>
<p>On May 1, 29th year of the Republic of China, the enemy's Third Division, Thirty-ninth Division, and two temporary detachments launched a fierce attack. On May 9, General Zhang wrote to Deputy Commander Feng Zhian: "Crossing the river, I am determined to fight to the death. This separation may be forever." He also conveyed to the generals: "When the enemy attacks, brother will go to the east bank of the river to sacrifice with my brothers. The country has reached this point, and there is no other way but for us to die for the country. Brother's determination to die for the country and the nation will never change, even if the sea dries up and the rocks crumble. I hope you brothers will encourage each other!"</p>
<p>It was with this state of mind that he personally led a small number of troops across the river.</p>
<p>Amidst the bloody rain and wind, General Zhang only ate a little broad beans to satisfy his hunger every day.</p>
<p>At dawn on the sixteenth, the enemy was getting closer. General Zhang had been surrounded layer upon layer. At noon, the bullets became denser and denser. General Zhang had already been hit by a rifle bullet in his left arm. In order to stabilize the morale of the army, he did not bandage it, and let the blood flow!</p>
<p>He refused to move his position, only ordering his subordinates to disperse, so as not to become the enemy's shooting target. At two thirty, all the officers and soldiers on the right wing were sacrificed. General Zhang was filled with grief and indignation, and led the last remaining few people to rush towards the right wing!</p>
<p>This was the last charge! General Zhang was hit by six machine gun wounds in a row, and his right chest was also pierced. He drew out the sword given by the leader and committed suicide, but his adjutant Zhu Zengyuan hugged him, but he had lost too much blood and finally could not hold on. Amidst the sound of cannons and machine guns, he hoarsely said, "To the country, to the nation, to the leader, to my conscience, I am at peace!"</p>
<p>In this way, he used facts to show his loyalty to the country, and he used his hot blood to write a glorious history of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>General Zhang's loyalty, bravery, and benevolence deeply moved the enemy. They treated General Zhang's remains with the honor of a general, and all officers and soldiers attended the ceremony. But finally, six days later, the officers and soldiers of our Thirty-eighth Division found the coffin and carried it back to the defense area. Deputy Commander Feng led all the officers and soldiers to welcome him dozens of miles outside the city, crying bitterly over the coffin, their sorrow shaking the heavens and the earth!</p>
<p>The coffin arrived in Chongqing on May 28th. Chairman Jiang personally led all the central authorities to welcome him at the Jianggan wharf, tears falling like rain!</p>
<p>Our victory is not accidental. From now on, let us forever commemorate this heroic national hero who dominated the battlefield every year on May 16, the anniversary of General Zhang's martyrdom, with the most pious and sorrowful sincerity, and let us pay tribute to the thousands of military and civilians who sacrificed in the War of Resistance! Once, he was only a hundred steps away from the enemy's tanks, he lay in the roadside fortifications, commanded the pistol team, and attacked the enemy with hand grenades! The soldiers burned with the blood of the Great Wall War of Resistance. Although their weapons were not as good as others, and their training was not as good as others, they still followed one another and repeatedly charged, and finally repelled the stubborn enemy!</p>
<p>When the Battle of Wuhan began, General Zhang was ordered to advance into Huangchuan to cover the main force of Xinyang. This was an isolated army, and the situation was very dangerous. The order from the command was to defend for five to seven days, but he personally braved arrows and stones, fighting fiercely for eleven days and nights. Even the enemy's radio admitted that they had encountered a strong enemy they had never seen before. In the army, General Zhang once telegraphed to his younger brother Ziming, saying: "As long as I am not dead for one day, I will fulfill my responsibility to kill the enemy for one day. If the enemy does not leave for one day, I will be loyal to the death!" He crossed the river.</p>
<p>The battle line was really long, and General Zhang could only draw on three regiments and two battalions. But the enemy added more than 20 planes and more than 10 heavy artillery pieces. A bloody battle unfolded in the drizzle. On May 11, there were more than a dozen repeated melees! On the 12th, he advanced to Zaoyang. General Zhang personally went to the front line to supervise the army, and the Japanese army finally retreated.</p>
<p>Starting on the 13th, General Zhang was ordered to turn to attack the enemy's 13th Division, which was advancing south. The battle line was in the Fangjiaji Nanguadian area. But at that time, not only were the generals and soldiers trapped, but even the food and ammunition were gradually running out. The enemy changed their plan and specialized in encircling General Zhang. The planes bombed densely, and General Zhang's troops were less than 3,000 people.</p>

<h3>The Problem of Children Lying</h3>
<p>— Fanxi</p>
<p>"Lying" is clearly in conflict with the inherent honesty of children. Why most children have a habit of lying occupies a very important research position in child psychology. Stern conducted many experiments, and the results all proved that lying is not the nature of children, but is due to the influence of acquired real-life environment. Therefore, to prevent children from lying, we must first understand the inner impulses of children's psychology and various emotions. Sometimes, because children do not correctly understand things and are easily influenced by suggestions, they say words that are contrary to their thoughts. If it is considered that this is lying, it is the biggest mistake. When a young child does not know the difference between a tiger and a leopard, he will say to his mother: "Mom, there was a big tiger in the movie!" In fact, what he saw was just a leopard; or he would see a lamb and call it a curly-haired dog. Such facts are often found in the conversations of young children. Children themselves are not lying, but because their understanding of things is too low. They do not have the ability to correctly distinguish things, and often regard large animals as tigers, or they often hear the term curly-haired dog, and then apply it to every small animal. Therefore, children's lying sometimes evolves from this type of fact and gradually becomes a habit. Moreover, children's imaginations are lively, and they fabricate facts and objective imaginations together, without feeling at all that they are being deceived by fictitious facts. Below are some common reasons for children's lying, which smart parents should pay attention to at all times:</p>
<p>(1) Driven by Selfish Ideas—Selfishness is human nature. When children first start social life, they want to monopolize all the toys of their companions. Therefore, children often want to lie to get a little benefit, or lie to satisfy their desires.</p>
<p>(2) Imitating Adults—Children have the greatest tendency to imitate. Children of four or five months old know how to learn the gestures and facial expressions taught by adults. Children can try to learn the appearance of their grandfather getting angry, and the posture of their grandmother eating. More obvious is that when one baby cries, another baby cries along; or when they see a child eating a pear, they would rather give up the orange in their hand and eat the pear. Therefore, parents often become examples of children lying due to temporary negligence. For example, to avoid seeing a guest, they tell their children: "Go tell Uncle Zhang quickly that Mom and Dad are not at home. Good baby, be obedient." Or they have children say they are a few years younger in order to get free rides, etc. These subtle facts can arouse children's motivation to lie; such facts are simply rewarding lying invisibly.</p>
<p>(3) Due to Greed or Laziness—This is also a tendency of selfishness. Children always hope to get a little more candy than others, so they often have to put on a straight face and show a pitiful appearance, saying: "I didn't eat a single pear today." or "All four candies were eaten by my brother, and I didn't get any." This kind of lying is entirely for the sake of getting more food. Children in elementary schools often say "My stomach hurts" because they haven't finished their homework or don't want to do cleaning work.</p>
<p>(4) Due to Fear—Fear is the main reason for children's lying. Most parents often find that when children have a little mistake, they will ask loudly and sternly, or even beat and scold them, which greatly affects the child's self-esteem. For the sake of self-esteem, children often lie to deceive their parents to avoid the punishment or beatings at the time.</p>
<p>(5) Due to Vanity and Cunning—Children have strong self-esteem, and at no time are willing to show their weakness or unreasonableness. Low-energy children, even if they are bullied by their companions, still boast how heroic and powerful they are in front of other companions. Lying with cunning is rare among young children. Children's cunning is usually fully revealed after the age of ten.</p>
<p>How to Prevent Lying?</p>
<p>Since we know that the reasons for lying are entirely due to acquired environment and habits, then teachers and parents must be particularly careful about the environment in which children are located. In addition to paying more attention to the cultivation of character and the formation of upright and friendly character, we must also pay attention to the following things:</p>
<p>(1) Loyalty—Whether it is a teacher or a parent, the attitude towards children must be loyal, set an honest example for children, and use honesty to gain children's faith. Every move must win the children's worship and respect.</p>
<p>(2) Gentleness—Love is the driving force of all educational behaviors, so smart teachers and kind parents should always maintain a gentle attitude towards children. Even when a child is found to have a mistake, he should be persuaded gently, not beaten or scolded, because intimidation and temptation can cause lying.</p>
<p>(3) Fairness—Treat children with absolute fairness, because children have strong self-esteem, and do not let them suffer undeserved insults. Pay more attention not to reward children for success obtained by cunning, and do not criticize a certain child for being stupid or a certain child for being smart in front of many people. Nor should you use punishment to correct his mistakes. This is not only useless, but also increases the child's desire to lie. You should also create an honest environment for children and secretly reward honest behavior. The most important thing is not to make children apologize in public. Use an honest, fair, and loving attitude to make the children repent themselves.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned points, of course, cannot include all educational methods, but if smart parents can truly implement them, then your children will not develop the habit of lying.</p>
<h3>How to Commemorate Mother's Day</h3>
<p>— Geng Xing</p>
<p>A few days ago, when we celebrated Mother's Day, I discussed with several friends: How should children commemorate it? How to commemorate it meaningfully?</p>
<p>I think work is the best way to commemorate it.</p>
<p>Mothers are as Jarvis, the founder of Mother's Day, said: "Suffer more and enjoy less." Think about it: from ten months of pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding to raising them to adulthood, which one is not the mother's business, which moment does she not worry about? Especially in China, where the social children's nursery industry is still in its infancy, and the unscientific nature of all equipment in the family, coupled with the increasingly high level of life today, mothers in general middle and lower families are really the most hard-working and even the most painful. They cannot afford servants. In addition to taking care of their children, they have to handle all the affairs in the family. The heavy burden of work makes them breathless. They get up early and go to bed late, and there is no moment of peace, let alone any entertainment.</p>
<p>Therefore, due to the lack of rest and adjustment in body and spirit, their bodies become weak and their youth quickly disappears. The spirit is stimulated by physical fatigue and even pain, the annoyance of children, the busyness of family trivial matters, and the heavy economic pressure, which often makes them become depressed, irritable, and easily angry; in this way, not only does she feel pain herself, but also the entire family atmosphere becomes tense and gloomy, which also has a bad influence on the children's spirits.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the children are old enough and physically able to do something, then in their spare time from studying, try to help their mothers do something and share some of her labor! And try to do it well, do the work with a playful mood, and do the work as happily as a game. Because excellent work results not only make you happy, but also make your mother happy, increase the atmosphere of harmony between families, and give the gift of happiness to young siblings.</p>
<p>For example, if you sweep the dusty room clean, wipe the dark glass windows bright, and arrange the cluttered objects in an orderly manner, when the work is completed, you will definitely feel infinite comfort and satisfaction with this refreshed scene in front of you, and your mother will definitely praise your ability, making her feel that her life's hard work for you is not in vain, but has received great comfort!</p>
<p>I know that you are all deeply loved by your mothers, so your mother's happiness should also be your happiness. What can make your mother happy is helping her operate and reducing her hard work. So every year when you commemorate Mother's Day, you have to find something that can make your mother the happiest to do.</p>
<h3>Meaningful Commemoration</h3>
<p>— Hu Bei</p>
<p>A week before Mother's Day, I suddenly received an English letter from a stranger, and what the letter said aroused my interest very much. Now I will make this letter public so that readers can appreciate it together. The letter said:</p>
<p>"I have always been thinking about my mother, thinking about her gentleness, thinking about her great sacrifices, thinking about her kindness, thinking about her... well, you know all those countless precious memories of mothers. I suddenly remembered that May 12th is Mother's Day, and on that day, all people in the world will respect their mothers, some will wear a carnation flower on their chest, and some will send flowers or candy or other things to their mothers. I think maybe some friends would like to commemorate Mother's Day like I do. The greatest suffering and sacrifice of a mother's life is childbirth. We who can get the best medical equipment still feel uneasy when giving birth, so what about those who cannot afford the best doctors to deliver their babies? Isn't helping poor mothers get proper medical care the best way to express our gratitude to our mothers? Therefore, I donated money to the Shanghai Civilian Women and Children's Hospital at 995 Kang Nao Road, because this is a place to help poor mothers get the best medical equipment before and after childbirth. After the baby is born, the medical expenses for the mother and newborn baby to stay in the hospital for ten days cost 20,000 yuan in national currency. I thought you might want to commemorate your mother in this way on Mother's Day."</p>
<p>Later, after investigation, I learned that this hospital is presided over by the famous doctor Dr. Wang Yihui, and the equipment is quite complete. It is really a good place for poor pregnant women who want to be mothers. If any readers want to commemorate their mothers in this meaningful way, they can donate directly to the hospital.</p>
<h3>Little Dress</h3>
<p>— Shufang</p>
<p>This is a small dress suitable for wearing now, preferably made of cloth. The top uses about one yard of white poplin material. The skirt uses four feet of material. The ones with a big red background and small white flowers or a sky blue background are beautiful.</p>
<p>Cut the size according to the style in the picture. Cut the skirt diagonally into a semi-circle, install a waistband, and then add suspenders to make a very beautiful and simple small skirt. The making of the top is very simple, and it can also be made with long sleeves, which looks very elegant when matched with skirts of any color.</p>
<h3>Mother's Day After Victory</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>I remember that on May 10, 1942, this newspaper published a special Mother's Day issue. At that time, it was the second Mother's Day, and a program was made to formulate three meanings, namely, 1. Promoting filial piety, 2. Promoting parental education, and 3. Relieving distressed parents.</p>
<p>On the twelfth of this month, we celebrated the first Mother's Day after victory. I think the above three points are still suitable. Regarding the first point, filial piety was originally considered a virtue by Chinese people, but some people were paralyzed by impure thoughts and thought that filial piety was outdated. At this time when morality urgently needs to be revitalized, it should be corrected and paid attention to.</p>
<p>Regarding the second point, I think it is even more important, because my country has a very short history of parental education, and most people do not know how to be parents. They cannot understand what the relationship between parents and children should ultimately be. Therefore, there cannot be a harmonious life between parents and children, which becomes a great obstacle to the work of managing the family.</p>
<p>The third point, relieving distressed parents, is of course a passive move, but for the sake of the entire society, being able to use extra strength to engage in relief can also promote the happiness of general families and make the entire social order more perfect.</p>
