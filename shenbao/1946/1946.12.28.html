<h3 id="c25">中美工商協會主席　要求美國減低關稅　盼我採平行步驟穩定貨幣 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿七日電〕中美工商協進會主席福葉，今以「包羅廣博之節略」交美國務院，交換有關明春商務協定談判之情報，福氏乃代表該協會中與對華商務直接有關之四百家公司者，福氏在其「節略」中，要求修改中國商務政策及關稅估值，蓋　彼認為此種政策已妨碍美國之對華輸入，渠復要求美國之輸出品作關稅上讓步，并要求美國對無競爭性之中國商品降低關稅壁壘。</p>
<p>在關稅方面，渠要求中國對進口貨之估值，應有合理而一致之政策，渠指稱：甚多美國出口商，已表示不滿，蓋中國對入口貨之估值，乃根據黑市價格，而不根據真正之批發市場價格，此項措施，不僅可產生不安混亂狀態，且亦助長中國之物價上漲。其次，中國必須改革其宣布及管理商務條例之程序，中國發表新條例時，并未充分通知各商家，且常不立即通知有關之中國機關，使美商與中國交易，發生困難，中國缺乏各式之機械設備及甚多原料，故該「節略」要求中國在此項進口貨予以關稅上之讓步。并稱：最近中國商界主張採取強硬之關稅保護政策，故此點有特別重要性。</p>
<p>由於目前中國進出口之差額甚大，協進會建議平車當儘可能，對中國輸入品減少關稅，蓋對中國輸入品之減低關稅，可能甚為有限，戰前中國輸入品之二分之一至三分之二係免稅者，內包括原料，如桐油·蠶絲·錫·生皮等，至於抽稅之貨物，平均逾總數百分之五十五。據協進會稱：此種入口稅之具體減低，可促進中國之對美輸入，從而可補救中國目前出進口間之畸形差額，此乃最近中國政府採取入口貨核準制之原因。此種關稅讓步，尤其應用於中國之手工業產品，如地毯，花邊，刺繡品，髪罩，瓷器，竹製品，草帽辮等，要之，其中可包括一切并不予美國商品競爭之貨物，且此種方法，在戰前即已建立，然鑒於目前中國成本之高，美國進口當局，乃對此類物品抽稅。且較戰前超出若干倍，因此打擊此種買賣。</p>
<p>「節略」復指稱：健全之雙邊商務，即繋於減低對此項物品之關稅，中國之外匯平準，未生效果及過高之法幣價格，未與實際購買力相等前，中國之進口業，甚少補救辦法，故協進會建議美國在採取關稅讓步時，中國政府當同時採取平行步驟，以求有效之穩定貨幣。</p>
<p>在中菲油類業務　美軍將放棄經營</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿六日電〕美際海軍石油局今日稱：美軍將於十二月卅一日退出其在華經營之商業性油類業務，其在菲律賓所經營者，則於明年一月卅一日退出。據公告稱：美政府之所以退出油類業務者，係因各私營公司刻已能自行運輸，并成立儲油機構，而此項工作在戰事結束初期係特此通知不能者，自對日勝利後，美軍可售與中國及菲律賓之各項油類，計達五百五十萬桶以上，此項計劃，係得美工業界之資助，蓋此可促使美人重建其經日軍中雨地區之利益也。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿六日電〕杜魯門總統頃向國會提出一九四六年第三季之第九次聯總工作報告，同時指出聯總結束後之一九四七年救濟需要。總統附函稱：「一九四七年聯總之救濟物資或將達七億五千萬美元之多，故不少解放區大槪不需要更進一步之救濟」。總統對於國務院處理一九四七年救濟事宜之建議，表示完全同意。渠稱：「國務院之建議為一九四七年迫切之救濟問題，應由供應國之政府與受助國之政府直接協商，而以聯合國秘書處作為各會員國政府交換情報之中心點。余對於此種處理一九四七年救濟問題之辦法，完全同意」。渠稱：聯合國現正積極討論聯總結束後之救濟問題，以及照顧難民之重要問題。渠續稱：下次向國會提出報告時，「可能提供更清楚之情形，報告聯總之清理計劃，以及對一九四七年聯總結束後之供應情形」。截至本年第三季為止，聯總運出之物資共計近一六，七二三，三四二公噸，價值約二·〇四五，〇三五，〇〇〇美元。對中國之救濟計劃，連同九月份價值二億二千七百萬美元以上之物資在內，已完成約百分之四十二。該一季內聯總運出之物資，以價值而言，當以運至波蘭，義大利與中國等三國者為最大。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿六日電〕美艦一艘被大連蘇軍當局逐出港口事件，美國國務院殆已認為結束。國務院新聞發佈處主任魏特今日宣稱：美艦在大連獲準逗留四十八小時，期滿接到退出之警吿，此項警告係蘇聯碼頭管理當局發出，非蘇軍司令發出。余以為此種警告并無最後通牒意義。蘇聯官方且於四十八小時限期屆滿後，允準延長兩小時，於情於理均無不合。</p>
<p>白宮宣佈經過</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓二十六日電〕美官員已進一步調查關於所謂美艦被迫撤離大連一事，發現事實與外傳頗有出入，所稱蘇方限令美艦於二十分鐘內撤退一節，尤非事實。美通訊艦一艘駛入大連後，蘇方負責官員準其在規定之停留時間外，延長停泊兩小時，而在延長之時間未到前二十分鐘該蘇聯官員即通知美方謂時間已到，若再事逗留而發生枝節，渠不予負責。美方官員認為：該蘇聯人員寬限美艦停留時間，極度表示合作，後發覺渠本人寬限美艦停留時間，未經其上峰核準，或因此慌亂，而不得不要求美艦離去。誠如美方某官員所稱：此次事件，絕未含有威迫或不友好之意。至於乘坐該艦之三美人，則因事先未獲蘇方準許，故未能登岸，且規定大連為自由港之中蘇條約亦尚未履行。</p>
<p>美報著論抨擊</p>
<p>〔合眾社紐約廿六日電〕斯克里浦，霍華德系報紙登載社論稱：美國務院以寬大態度解決大連事件，承認蘇聯當局在該城有放下銀幕之權，此一事實足以曲解該處之大局。該社論謂：「蘇軍控制大連，其唯一原因為中國政府不能說服蘇聯將該城交還中國」。該報指責國務院遠東司（司長為范宣德）對蘇聯所採「曾力圖危害麥帥在日本之地位，并因蔣主席曾拒絕對中共讓步而不信任其所領導之中國政府」。該社論結論稱：「在國務院未曾剷除此赤色「細胞」以前，美國將繼續喪失其威信與慶享之法權」。</p>

<h3 id="c44">邊疆教育會議的召開　—并賀國際文化合作協會成立 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>具有歷史意義的國民大會甫經閉幕，我們又看見兩種也具有歷史意義的集會，召開於南京，其一為教育部召開的邊疆教育大會，又其一則為廿六日召開的國際文化合作協會成立大會。此兩集會之召開，雖所具性質及意義不一，然同為有關文教之集會，則彼此同之。人民所渴望的國家根本大汗制成了以後，而有此項有關文教會議之召開，實在是很可喜的。何以言之？我們於國民大會閉幕之際，曾就「制憲大業的完成」有所論述，以為講到憲法，「憲法本身不僅是若干條文，而是一種活的，具有生命的創造物。憲法的制定僅能說是憲法的產生，像剛誕生的嬰兒一樣，它還得發育以至長成，」我閃願全國人民能愛護我們的憲法，使它能够長育以達成年。使人民能够愛護我們的憲法，多半是一個教育的問題。我們要提高人民的教育水準，然後人民纔能够愛護這從艱苦中所產生出來的國家大法。繼國民大會之後而有此項文教會議是可喜的，因為邊疆教育結果，必可能提高邊疆地同胞對於憲法的愛護；而國際文化合作協會的成立，無疑地，其目的又在文化的領域內，增進國際間的了解；是則我們的根本大法，必可能藉國際文化合作協會這一個媒介，得到國際間一般的認識與了解。凡此，無不同憲法的誕生有關；是糨國民大會之後而有此項有關文教會議之召開，實在是可喜的事。</p>
<p>講到連續教育，這裏面的問題并不簡單，第一，邊疆教育是一個頗為龍統的名詞。我國邊疆遼闊，居留於邊疆的同胞在語言，文化，乃至血統上，本甚複雜。蒙古，西藏，新疆，以及在西南居留的各夷族，在語言，文化，乃至血統上并不相同；他們都有他們所特有的問題，出現在新疆的問題，未必盡同於西藏，不過，他們之都為我邊疆同胞則一；因其同為邊疆，我們在處理邊疆教育的問題上，便不得一秉我中央對邊政的決策。中國國民黨二中全會曾有關於邊疆政策的重要決議，開宗明義，首先就說：「查我蒙，藏，回三族同胞，俱為構成我大中華民族之一員，而其分布之地區，更為我領土不可分之一部。本黨之於各邊疆同胞，向本扶助發展之旨，携手邁進，期其共　於富強康樂之境。…今搞戰勝利，建國之責任，應由我全國同胞共同負之。」在這個決議裏所通過的，或則涉及憲法中須有明白規定保障邊疆民族之自治權利，或則涉及邊疆同胞參加政府的機會，其中有關文教者為：「在邊疆民族所在地各級之施教，應滋生本族文字，并以國文為必修科，由教育部斟酌施行，各級機關之行文，以國文及本族文字并用為原則。」</p>
<p>對此邊疆政策，本報　曾著論有所論列，認為：「國民黨二中全會的決議，於擴大邊地同胞的固有文化生活，不特足以表示中央對邊地同胞的關注，抑亦為他們此後的發展關拓了一條大道。…因此決議，我國的民族政策，愈益明顯，…這政策在消極方面的意義，是我們摒棄了具有侵略意味的同化政策，在積極方面，我們的民族政策是在扶殖邊地同胞的自我發展，而尤注意於他們固有文化的發育。今國民大會所通過之憲法，其第一百六十九條，且明白規定：「國家對於邊疆地區各民族之教育，文化，交通，水利，衛生及其它經濟，社會事業，應積極舉辦，并扶助其發展，對於土地使用，應依其氣候，土壤性質，及人民生活習慣之所宜，予以保障及發展。」是則扶助邊疆地區我同胞固有文化之發育，今且載明憲章。那末，所謂邊疆教育，其重心便也應該在扶助當地人民固有文化生活的發育，進而提高其教育水準。我們的鄰邦，蘇聯，它就採取這樣的政策；我國的邊疆又多蘇聯為鄰；我們尤應該善體國策而努力於邊疆教育之推進。</p>
<p>我們於此又應該祝賀的，就是國際文化合作協會的成立。該會的成立，我主席特頒訓詞，有所勗勉。國際文化合作協會之成立，旨在推進我國與國際間之文化關係，以謀增加我國與國際間之了解，查國與國交，其關係雖為多方面的，要以文化關係最為基始。故晚近各國對於促進國際文化合作，莫不有機構專司其事。即在我國，我們看見有英國文化委員會，美國新聞處以及蘇聯方面的文化活動。我國以文化古國而獨無是項機構專司其事，終覺不無遺憾。今國際文化合作協會成立於南京，必能秉承度席之訓勉，發揚光大我傳統文化，增益和叫族友善精神；是則將來國際文化合作協會之成績，必能與英國之英國文化委員會東西輝映。茲當其成立之際，謹申祝賀之忱。</p>
<h3 id="c45">空運的空前慘劇 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>圣誕節日發生在上海的民用航空三客機肇鬧事件的慘劇，發生在同日，其間相距不過幾小時，而死傷達八十餘人，這真是民用航空史上慘劇。過了三日，我們纔從驚愕悲悼的情緒中轉過來，開始有所思索。我們當然很感到驚異，這一連串的慘劇，竟發生於同時同地。對於死者，自然表示無限的哀悼與惋惜。由於這一連串慘劇的發生，當然使人想到責任問題。關於這個責任問題，不是航空界裏有資格的人員，是頗難於下斷語的。現在政府的主管當局旣已來滬澈查，深信在不久的將來，必能將責任判明；我們似毌須在此多所論列。不過關於飛機失事的責任問題及技術問題，我們局外人雖不必多所嘵舌，但由於此次三客機在一日內邊疆失事，對於若干點，卻迫使我們不得不加以考慮。</p>
<p>第一，出事這一天上海氣候的惡劣是眾所周知的事，據報載若干客機因接得上海氣候惡劣的電訊，即中止來滬。我們現在所要考慮的就是失事三機的飛滬，是否不曾接得上海氣候惡劣中止飛滬的電訊。如果不曾接得，為何上海不去電報告；如果去電報告，而未收到，則機中之無綫電設備必有問題；　以機中有問題之無綫電設備，不加檢查修理而逕載客飛行；　　無綫電設備無問題，那不免又是飛行人員的紀律問題。對於這些，大家都關心這次民航空慘案，願意明瞭一些。</p>
<p>第二，飛行的設備似乎實在有點問題。假使飛機場有盲目降落的設備，或者不致釀成這樣的慘劇；倘使飛機中又有降落傘的設備，則似乎也不致有這樣多的死傷。關於這些，航空公司疏忽之責，似乎難辭。至於霧，這本身本不直接造成這次的慘案。重慶是出名的霧都，而在重慶，在戰時的艱苦環境下，我們并不曾聽見有像此次的慘劇。</p>
<p>死者已不可復活，由於此次民用航空的慘劇，我們願政府及航空公司能同樣提高他們對於飛行安全的警覺。機場的設備，如果不完備應該補充；龍華的民用航空機場如果不敷用，應予添建。現在中美間及中法間的航空協定，已經簽訂，不久將有國際民用航空飛經上海；我們尤須注意上海機場的效能。由於這閃慘痛經驗，我們願此後的民用航空能更趨於安全。</p>

<h3 id="c64">越國民黨領袖表示　爭取獨立奮鬬到底　願與維明釋嫌修好組織聯合政府　俾與法方商訂有利協定 <a href="#c64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社南京廿六日電〕越南國民黨高級人員頃向本社記者談稱：越南國民黨準備與胡志明總統所領導之政府釋嫌修好，為共同的主張與法國奮鬥到底。越南國民黨己與聯合政府開始進行談判，俾樹立聯合陣綫，雙方前在勞開區發生戰爭，業己停止，如為越南利益所需要，則越南國民黨　與胡志明總統組織聯合政府。以言越南與法國之關係，越南人民急欲停止流血，而與法國成立協定。法國如願以自治領之地位界予越南，其後再在法蘭西聯邦之範圍內予以獨立，則此項協定即可成立。法國如在原則上能同意越南派遣外交代表駐在國外，則越南國民黨亦能表示滿意，且於最短期內僅要求派遣領事駐在越南各鄰邦之權。關於南圻舉行公民投票事，法國越南與南圻三方面混合委員會如能保證自由投票，則其投票之結果如何，越南國民黨自必予以接受。惟在中圻南部高原地區居有少數民族，敎育文化落後，無法舉行公民投票，實為一棘手之問題。反之，任何解決方案，凡使越南不能保有中圻南部者，越南國民黨均不能予以接受，惟此一問題亦非不能解決者也。越南國民黨亟欲修改本年三月六日所簽訂之法越兩國協定，尤其是關於少數民族之問題，但對於法越兩國成立關税同盟一事，越南國民黨準備予以接受。要之，越南準備保證法國在經濟上及文化上之利益，並願與法國忠實合作，以發展越南云。按越南國民黨領袖係前外交部長阮祥三，現在南京，主張組織「國民陣綫政府」，或有出任內閣總理兼外長之可能。</p>

<p>〔合眾社西貢廿七日電〕此間法軍事當局頃宣佈：法軍在越南戰區北部多處，擊退猛烈反攻之維明軍隊。又據公報稱：維明軍隊在河內異常活動，於該處若干地點發動反攻，但被擊退，雙方均有損失。據稱，陣亡之維明軍隊中有日人八人。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿六日電〕維明電台稱：維明共和國政府於上週遷出河內，移至河內西南十三公里處之哈登。法軍公報謂，河內東南八十哩處之南定，於聖誕夜及聖誕日曾有激戰，法軍堅守原防，重創維軍。河內郊外嘉關飛機場亦曾有維軍來攻，均經法軍擊退。河內與巴寗間卅二公里之供應道路上，亦己無維軍蹤跡，海防維軍據點被法軍克服者不少。本社西貢最近來電謂，法軍在河內之掃蕩戰，遭遇維軍堅決反抗。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社西貢廿七日電〕法殖民部長慕台今日在此宣稱，任何企圖凡未經與當地人民諮詢，而遽以中圻南部或南圻之極少部份割讓越盟共和國者，均當予以拒絕云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社西貢廿七日電〕越南各團體今日聯名上書慕台呼籲和平，謂立即停止衝突，乃為防止越南毁滅及保護法國利益之唯一方法。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿六日電〕西貢來電稱：法殖民部長慕台抵西貢後，會晤法高級專員達香禮歐，越南法軍司令伐羅埃及其參謀長勒消洛希，復接見甫自河內戰區來西貢之貝拉京德少校，故對越南局勢己獲知其全貎。慕台抵西貢後，即由交趾支那臨時政府總統李文輝為其洗塵，並由其僚屬報告維明份子在越南南部活動之情形，慕台向記者表示，渠在越逗留為期甚促，希望於一月十六日即返國向政府報告。</p>

<p>〔聯合社西貢廿七日電〕越南人民共和政府秘密電台於聖誕節廣播文告，聲明對於河內發生戰事，歸咎法方。文告稱，法方於十二月十九日提出最後通牒，要求越南人民共和政府將　權移交法方，戰事因而開始。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎卄六日電〕法外部人士認為越南之戰，乃維明之預謀行動。法外部發言人謂維明軍於十二月十九日開始進攻乃預謀的侵略，在發動侵略以前維明政府故意造成法維間較和緩之關係，使法當局疏於戒備。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿七日電〕越南事件仍為巴黎各報社評之辯論資料。左派報章痛斥越南使用武力，並要求召回法駐越高級專員達香禮歐。如「法蘭西導報——之言曰」，「保護法國人之生命，實無需演成流血事件，迫使越盟政府無條件投降後始可實現，只需不再奴役越盟人民，代以民主方針即可達到此目的。再者，駐越專員達香禮歐應予召回，傳可緩和局勢」云。反之，人民共和黨領袖許曼在「環球報」發表一文，則為　氏辯護。略謂，「某派人士好發關於消滅法西斯主義之議論，今之越南戰爭，則己發現侵略羣中之日軍軍官，由此可知殘餘勢力尚存在其間。吾人猶憶法軍前為搜彙日軍暴行之證據。而發生遭遇攻擊之朝森事件，豈亦可　咎於達香禮歐乎。」</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖廿六日電〕聯合國原子能委會政治小組委會本日舉行會議，以十票之多數通過其報告書中之技術部份，波蘭代表棄權。蘇聯代表亞力山德羅夫表示蘇聯代表團尚無時間研究報告書之內容，故未參加投票。本日所通過報告書之技術部份，共長達五十頁，分成五章：（一）綜合報告原子能委員會成立以來之工作；（二）管制原子能之技術問題；（三）各種建議——此一部分係屬空白，須俟執行委會對於管制制度成立協議後，再行填入；（四）專家委會所提出之報告書；（五）關於原子能委會各代表所進行會談之報告書。由是觀之，因第三章係屬空白，故本日所通過之報告書，其內容純屬技術性質，對於管制原子能之制度，初未提出任何建議。至於美國代表巴魯克所擬就之計劃，則定於明日與加拿大之建議，一併提交執行委會。聞加拿大代表麥克諾登，返國向政府當局請示，明日當可返此。蘇聯代表之態度，仍為未知之因素。蘇聯代表葛羅米柯及亞力山德羅夫雖均拒絕參加討論，但因報告書須於十二月卅一日以前提交安全理事會，故亦不得不採取確切之立場。</p>

<p>〔路透社新德里廿六日電〕維明共和國駐印度代表梅德周今夜稱，勒格萊將軍所部軍隊，以及更多之飛機坦克軍艦及傘兵，正源源開往越南。該一勒格萊將軍即係於一九四五年在英印軍協助下佔領越南之人，由於法軍之大規模進攻，維明民主共和國己岌岌可危，深望印度同胞羣起聲援。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿六日電〕蘇聯電台評論家今日對於越南糾紛，初次加以批評。略謂，越南時局己有嚴重之轉變，引起全世界之注意。前當一九四四年時，法國正式允許在法國聯邦機構之內，界予越南自治，厥後越南解放後，亦作同樣之聲明。此項決定之實施，與聯合國揭示之精神與原則相符，但仍不足以阻止衝突之爆發，騷擾正日益其甚。本年三月間，法國駐越南專員達香禮歐與越南共和國總統胡志明簽訂協定，結束法越雙方之軍事行動，並承認越盟為自由共和國。殆至本年七月六日法越雙方又在巴黎舉行談判，討論雙方關係，至九月十四日為止，意見甚為紛歧，繼之簽訂臨時協定。自是以來，法越關係嚴重，繼之以越南境內之軍事衝突。該評論家最後引述法國左派報紙之言論，謂法國民主派對越南之流血事件，表示焦慮，和平與安全之全體友人對此均有同感云。</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿六日電〕密歇根州共和黨參議員范登堡，為一九四八年可能當選總統之六人中之一，亦為一九四七年美外交政策之關鍵。渠於共和黨競選獲勝以後，曾向世界表示美國之外交政策將不變更，然美人或世界人士猶未忘却在五年以前渠乃著名之孤立派，曾投票反對徴兵及租借法案，就其過去政見觀尚有三大問題須於其今後之談話中獲取解答：</p>
<p>（一）孤立主義　珍珠港事件時范登堡猶為孤立派，但在數閱月後，竟完全轉變作風，承認其過去之錯誤，今日渠與貝爾納斯同為〔兩黨政策〕之創立者，然范登堡固為美國孤立派鼻祖參議員波拉之信徒，國際聯盟之失敗，波拉應負一大部份責任。范登堡今後是否將完全棄絕其根深蒂固之孤立思想尚成問題。</p>
<p>（二）國際主義　由於戰爭之進行及戰後之緊張局面，范登堡之國際主義觀念己益見堅固，今一般皆知渠為若干外交政策曾向其共和黨施行重大壓力，然此等壓力，並非一一均能奏效，例如英美借款案，范登堡個人雖表贊成，然共和黨之大部份則表反對，預料國會於討論增加進出口銀行資本十二億五千萬美元一案時，共和黨之大部份議員將表反對，而范登堡本人最近亦曾表示美國之財力，不足為世界永久之捐助人。届時范登堡將支持貝爾納斯乎？抑附和共和黨內政專家塔夫脱之意見乎？尚有待於事實之證明。</p>
<p>（三）另一問題　為范登堡過去在國際貿易政策中所取之立場。當范氏採取孤立作風之時，渠力主關税應以國內外生產價值之差額為基礎，時至今日，共和黨仍採取此項傳統的關各政策，是與貝爾納斯等之關税自由政策，適成相反。范登堡既以兩黨政策為標榜，但對於此一重大之經濟政策，何去何從尚待事實證明。預料在新年開始後之數目，前項問題即可獲得解答。</p>
<h3 id="c90">資本達八十億美元的　世界銀行 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>……要使國際經濟和國際政治分離開來，是一椿極困難的事情，己往如此，於今亦然。</p>
<p>美國和蘇聯控制各國間的政治糾紛，使新世界銀行的貸款工作未能順利展開。</p>
<p>世界銀行董事會最近決定不放出救濟借款，此事顯與美國對聯合國　後救濟總署的工作不能完全滿意有關。由於聯總的國際性質，美國所捐贈的金錢物資雖多，但不能由她自己支配，所以當美國與南斯拉夫鬧着糾紛，甚至在鬧得最厲害的時候，聯總的救濟品照樣源源不絕地運到南斯拉夫去。職是之故，在世界銀行開業的時候，美國官吏顯不願重蹈覆轍。</p>
<p>美國國會下次開會時，或有人主張給予希臘，意大利和奧地利「直接的援助」，藉以彌補聯總工作結束後所造成的缺陷。但是波蘭，南斯拉夫，捷克斯拉夫和其他東　國家則被認為自己可以有辦法，至多也祇能從美國或其他國家得到一些私人的救濟而己。假如她們乞助於世界銀行，那就一定要提出詳細的復興計劃，說明借款的用途，單是要求緊急救濟是不中用的。</p>
<p>雖然世界銀行也是一個國際機關，和聯總比較起來並無多大區别，但是在聯署中，美國的捐款雖比别國多，發言權却並不比另國大多少。可是在世界銀行中，百分之三十五以上的表決權却掌握在美國的手裏，至於表決權的分配，差不多和各國所投的資金成比例的，世界銀行的資本總額達八十億美元，美國即佔百分之三十五左右。同時根據銀行的規則，任何國家要求借款，必須獲得直接有關國家的核准（例如，欲借美金的借款，必須獲得美國核准），而目前各國所提的借款要求，幾乎完全用美金作標準的。因此世界銀行對借款問題有所決定時，勢必和美國的國際政策發生聯繫。此外，希望借款的國家，也遲遲未將詳細的申請書提出，因為她們知道世界銀行出借款項的能力尚未確立前，提出申請也無濟於事。</p>
<p>世界銀行第一批借款大致將借給法國，因為法國早就說明要借五萬萬美元進行復興工作，諸凡借款的用途以及歸償的方法，都己準備就緒。荷蘭要求借一筆款子來墊補國際貿易上的差額，大致也不會有什麼困難。</p>
<p>波蘭所提借款六萬萬美金的要求，一時恐不易辦到。猶憶今年六月間美國政府對於經由進出口銀行借給波蘭的四千萬美元信用借款，曾扣除不付，一　要波蘭把該國和鄰近各國所簽的商約公布之後，才可以照辦。</p>
<p>捷克斯拉夫可能要求借款三萬萬美元，但是前途不一定很順利。此外，丹麥大致將要求五千萬美元，智利大致將要求四千萬美元，至於能否成為事實，仍須待諸將來。</p>
<p>世界銀行在成立最初數年中的展望如何，目前尚難斷言。根據銀行內外各專家的意見，一九四七年內世界銀行的貸款能力，大致為十五億美元，至一九五〇年，可達八十億美元的高峯。（見圖）</p>
<p>到世界銀行放款數額日益增加的時候，可能有新會員國加入，所以一定有更多的資金作為借款的後盾。至於目前，世界銀行雖己開業，但是離開實現勃蘭頓金融會議所定崇高目標的時日尚遠。參加世界銀行各國都覺得要使國際經濟和國際政治分離開來，是一椿極困難的事情，巳往如此，於今亦然。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿七日電〕國際復興開發世界銀行副總裁史密斯今日宣佈：哥倫比亞巳成加入該銀行之第三十九個國家，認款額三千五百萬美元。查世界銀行之孿生組織世界貨幣基金團自成立起，哥倫比亞即係該團會員國，但該國參加世界銀行，則因國內法律上技術關係，遷延至今。尚有五國曾參加一九四四年夏季舉行之勃蘭頓會議，可在本月三十一日以前加入世界銀行，但迄今猶未表示加入，此五國為紐西蘭，澳大利，委內瑞拉，利比里亞與蘇聯</p>

<p>筵席租之征收，仍以原定之三千元爲起稅點，不論中西菜肴，凡超過三千元者一律征稅。至於新稅法中所規定，超過起稅點不及五倍者，稅率爲百分之十，五倍以上者，稅率爲百分之二十。然財局以每項價格難於稽核，故建議改爲視菜館營業設備及是否承辦整桌菜肴，分爲甲乙丙三等。甲等按百分之二十征稅，乙等按百分之十征稅，有音樂跳舞之菜館，則按娛樂稅征課百分之二十五，其餘專售平民飯食之飯店點心店，仍予免稅。上項筵席稅分等征稅辦法，已經昨晨之市政會議中通過，惟尙須待市參議會通過後，方克實施。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕穩定紗價辦法六點，自於日前由六區棉紡公會王啓宇晉謁宋院長，作進一步之洽商後，業已獲得具體協定。昨日該六點辦法，終於在下午二時召開之六區棉紡公會會員大會席上，獲得順利通過。昨日下午四時，紡管會即擴　舉行會議。到吳兼主委，李副主委，委員束　章，王啓宇，王仰先，吳味經，唐星海，郭棣活，榮一心，及該會業務處長劉文騰等，當將六點辦法，提付討論。略加附註，即獲通過。惟新方案之實施期限問題，尚待呈請宋院長核示。此外對政府收購棉紡議價，決定由國民營紗廠，各推代表三人，於今日上午十時，在江西路紡建公司議定計算成本之會計項目，然後各別計算其成本。茲紡建公司業已推定蔡回民等三人代表，民營廠則推定永安，申新，慶豐三廠代表。又第四期第四次複制業配紗，決待新議價核定後，再行發配。茲將紡管會所通過「穩定紗價辦法」六點，探誌如次：</p>
<p>穩定棉紗辦法</p>
<p>（一）凡已購及擬購外棉之紗廠，自三十六年一月一日起所製之棉紗，由政府收購其半數，如將棉紗織布者，得收購其棉布。附注：暫在上海市區內各紗廠實行。</p>
<p>（二）收購價格，照成本加百分之二十利潤。上項收購價格，由紡管會指派代表一人，紡建公司及民營紗廠各推代表一人，組織審議會議定之。</p>
<p>（三）除被收購外，所餘之紗布，由各廠集中市場，公開交易，上項交易之買賣，戶名，數額，及用途，按日編製詳表，送主管機關審核。附注：各廠在本廠開紗外，應將當日開紗數量，報告指定地點市場管理員，（指定地點暫時在紗業公會）。</p>
<p>（四）政府為運用所有收購之紗布，作為平衡紗布價格之用。上項配售價格，如較收購價格有盈額時，由政府專戶存儲。為輔助棉花生產及發展紡織業之用。</p>
<p>（五）此後任何紗廠，凡由政府供給外匯，所購之棉花，製成之紗布，百分之五十由政府收購。其收購價格照成本加百分之二十利潤。其購國棉所製之紗布，得按照第三條辦次自行買賣。</p>
<p>（六）本辦法俟紗布市價相當穩定時停止之。</p>

<p>金鈔吸胃濃厚　烚赤昨仍在實銷及補空聲中，逐漸拉高，晨開三三五萬，開後即因報載金融恐慌已有維持者，自三三三萬盤漲到三四二萬，逢高有若干壓力而回降至三三四萬，無如人心已定，形勢見穩，十時後央行以三三八萬之價，配給一三四條，此後散買慫動下，一再扳高，供源見滯，高價迫近三五〇萬，逢高續有少數壓力，午刻在三四五萬左右，午後即交復漲，隔日交割開出即躍升至三五〇萬外，央行逢高供給，加之浮多有售，臨收竟退至三二八萬，結果較前收再跌二萬，飾金掛三五萬，紋銀銀元俱平，暗拆銀根略鬆，息價自一角六至一角八不等。</p>
<p>外幣漸趨穩定，美鈔最初暗市自六二五〇元買價起，午刻盤升至六五〇〇元左右，午後高價達六七〇〇元，後以金價急降，最後復回低至六三〇〇元結束，結果較前收微升一五〇元，港票因廣幫急於求現，結果告跌三十元，港匯曾降低至一二一〇元，金鈔回漲，午刻一二五〇元仍有供給，印匯一五二五元，英匯二〇〇〇〇元，均屬賣價，成交不多。</p>
<p>公債昨稍穩健，雜牌甲乙有六〇四室吸納而較堅，統丙晨開一五八〇元，自一六〇〇元起，經五樓兩大戶來售，回低至一四三〇元，臨收仍站一四五〇元以上，結果較前收計甲乙升一二〇元，丙升三十元，丁升五十元，戊升七十元，成交約三百萬元，</p>
<p>股市補吸不弱　華股昨以一般消息見好，但業中人迫於年尾，對敲交易有年內結束，并不轉期之說，散多過於擁擠，欲漲而多阻撓，臨收竟以低價結束，晨開即因報載消息助買而微昂，開後即遭場外供給而趨疲，二〇七號一九九號一四號九九號二二九號有售，逐漸下降，十時後現永紗退至六一〇元，遞永紗六一二元，此時因金市甚穩，八九號補進之下，稍見回升，後以金價見漲，一七八號等亦購而升至六四〇元外，榮　於是時經一五一號售至停限，微有掙扎，八三號一四五號八九號二三三號一五四號一五一號一九八號連續買進，遞永紗於十一時一刻後，漲到六五四元，二〇七號一七一號二一五號一七八號有售，近午金市亦回，散多爭售，午收見疲，結果較前收計永紗勤興微挫，美亞信和景福新光微升，華豐則平，冷股景福漲停，火柴升半成，慶安跌二成弱，餘者微升，遞交永紗信和微升，新光勤興華豐平平，美亞升半成，午後因金價已昂，上塲即高，一五二號二三二號二一二號二二九號二一五號均進，現永紗升至六四五元，一八五號有售，曾回落十餘元，無如金市更俏，二二九號一九八號一四五號再進，乃見六四八元高價，一八五號二二四號四號一四號一六號連續供售，金價忽起大跌，最後竟破入六〇〇元內，結果較前收計永紗新光各跌半成光景，美亞華豐信和微降，勤興景福微升，冷股火柴升一成，中紡大通微升，景興與華豐均平，塲外各股榮辱成微。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日米到貨不多，計南市九四〇担，北市二六五三担，有關人員表示：來貨稀少之原因，一為天雨，販賣商之活動較少，二為本市銀根甚緊，致米店進貨不踴躍，現在密切注意今後數日內之到貨數量，如仍麗稀少，將採取必要措置。米價甚為平穩，北市之常熟米每担六萬三千元。</p>
<p>又訊，米市昨以天氣轉晴，人心軟化，客方無意扳守，店胃見懈，市塲賣氣濃旺，北粳續跌一二千元，南粳再挫二三千元，白元陰元步削一二千元，秞米仍少成交，麵粉因內地高昂，惟申方今日加拿大洋粉續有見抵，供源無處，形趨穩定之局，麥皮胃呆，續疲一二百元，豆餅汕頭進胃尚可，奈油廠供應接連，價格微升百元，豇豆汕頭收購仍續，依然挻秀，彔豆俏　，赤豆暫平，苞米青島繼續吸收，市勢挺站，紅糧原盤，芝蔴廣銷蟬聯，軋升千元，生仁銷路動而不旺，無榮無辱，蠶豆平庸，黃豆到銷兩不見旺，勢成擯局，油市萎靡不振，蔴油下跌二三千元，豆油盤小一二千元，菜油平疲，桶生油亦然回跌二三千元，惟萋生油店胃尚續，見挺一二千元，各糧暫趨平疲之狀。</p>

<p>— 馬靜軒</p>
<p>教學演示，爲輔導教師進修，改進教學方法，最有效的活動。教學演示的舉行，由校長或視導人員或教育研究團體，請定一位教師，用示範的教法，把教學過程，很親切的表演出來，使參觀的教師，得到一個正確的印象。</p>
<p>上海市本學期各學區教育研究會，常常舉行教學演示。這種研究的風氣，早在勝利前民二十四年起，陳鶴琴·陳選善兩位教育家，主持上海市特區教育行政時，即已切實地推行。現在上海市教育局督學室與國民教育處，便以此爲輔導教師進修的中心工作，全市教師亦莫不踴躍參加。</p>
<p>因爲教學演示，具有改進教學方法的特效，確有提倡推行的必要。茲特將舉行進應注意之點，寫在下面，以供教育界負有輔導教師進修責任的機關或個人的參考。</p>
<p>（一）在舉行教學演示之前，視導人員與擔任演示的教師，應舉行一次會議，共同決定演示的內容與方法，使演示人知道這次演示的注重點，以便參觀人容易明瞭。</p>
<p>（二）有些教學過程，不適於演示，不妨加以變更，使易於觀察。</p>
<p>（三）在演示教學之前，擔任教師，不妨先行試教一遍，並編製教案，以資熱練。</p>
<p>（四）演示時，視導人員應與參觀教師，同去參觀。</p>
<p>（五）參觀時，應公推一位教師擔任速記，把教學過程，記錄下來，作爲事後討的根據。</p>
<p>（六）演示教學完畢，應即舉行討論會。</p>
<p>（七）討論會開始時，應由擔任演示的教師，報告平時教學常規，教學技術與此次教學過程活用的地方。</p>
<p>（八）參觀人如有疑問，應即提出，請求擔任演示的教師答復。</p>
<p>（九）參觀人就參觀所得的優點，缺點，提出問題，共同討論。原來教學演示，不一定就是範教，儘管不客氣的批評。</p>
<p>（十）擔任演示的教師，要時常更換，不要僅由少數人擔人。</p>
<p>教學演示，是視導人員指導教師改進教學的良好制度，且最容易獲得教師的同情與了解，值得介紹與提倡，全國各地教育研究團體與學校，不妨試試看。</p>

<h3 id="c197">海南島的農林事業　林學家陳養材氏訪問記 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 南京八日訊　波瀅</p>
<p>陳稚（字養材）敎授爲我國有數林學家，年來以學者從政，出任農林部技正；去歲日寇投降以後，奉命赴海南島辦理接收。最近甫自瓊崖歸來，十一月廿六日在南京金陵大學作學術講演，題爲『海南島的農林事業』，內容豐富廣泛，分析淸楚詳盡。記者恭聆之後，復於本月三日趨陳先生寓所晋謁請敎，陳先生不厭求詳，悉心指示，記者以其所談關係國計民生，至深且鉅，故特爲記錄而發表之，以促國人之注意。</p>
<p>資源處女地</p>
<p>海南烏爲我國南部沿海一大海島，與台灣並稱爲中國之兩目，勝利以後，台灣與海南島相繼收復；但台灣因經日人五十年之努力，已其規模，故常局特設獨立行政系統以資經營，而報章雜誌競載台灣情况和消息，引起國人普遍而熱烈之注意，實屬可喜之現象。對海南烏問題，當局固未甚注意，而報拿雜誌亦絕少記載和報道，無怪陳先生沉痛而言，吾人不能令中國盲盲目，而漠不關心也。</p>
<p>海南島一名瓊崖，位於北緯十八度至二十度，東經一百〇八度至一百十一度間，土肥肥沃，氣候和暖如熱帶，農業資源處女地也。戰前我國無力及此，任其荒蕪；但日寇垂涎已非一日，故於二十八年二月十日入侵後，即作有計劃之佈置，準備長期盤踞，經營開拓，以爲台灣第二。特設海南島農政委員會，掌全島農林事業，凡所有烏上農業之改進，農產之加工，各農林公司之分貼，分配定當。其國內及台灣南洋各地之有力農林公司受命前來開設者凡二十八個單位，其中包括農業公司，林業公司，產業公司，漁業公司，食品加工事業，水利事業等。各項事業之總投資額共計一萬三千七百萬元，日人在海南島反投資總額共六萬萬無，占其百分之二十三弱；而一部分海軍所經辦者，其經費猶未計入於內各農林公司，咸按照計劃，次第進行，開辦雖有先後，規模　有大小然莫不各有目標，努力　赴，年來損耗，在所不計，蓋　謂國策公司，自非一般僅以牟利為目的之私人企業所可比倫。</p>
<p>瓊崖農業以作物爲主，其中可分食用作物，特用作物，園藝作物三項：</p>
<p>作物的內容</p>
<p>關於食用作物，本島農業幾全為此類作物所支配，其中以東北部之稻及西南部之甘諸爲大宗；蓋以東北濕潤，西南乾燥使然也。又因地處熱帶，稻年可三熟，甘諸年可四熟，可謂得天獨厚；偕以地未盡其利，人未盡其力，故食糧仍感不敷，而年賴洋米之　入，良可歎也，日人曾以台灣之蓬萊稻種在瓊試植，已有良好成續，再加努力，則木島食糧問題之解決，實非難事；惜各農業公司由經濟部，軍政部接收後，以不善處理，蓬萊稻種散失殆盡，艮好根茲，　於一旦，言之痛心。關於甘諸，日人對於新種之導人栽培，病蟲害之驅除防備，均不遺餘力，預計五年以後，栽植面橫可增至五萬公頃，其單位產量，以良種之普及，耕作之改善，每年每公頃增產三百公斤時，則全島廿諸生產可達每年三萬七千五百公斤之巨，不惟可補本烏食糧之不足，且對於液體燃料之生產亦多裨益也。他如豆類，小麥，木薯等，七年來，日人孜孜不倦，選擇良種，普爲推廣，成績亦斐然可觀。</p>
<p>特用作物，包括製糖之甘蔗，製汕之落花生，胡麻，纖維之棉花，黃麻，苧麻，以及烟草等。甘蔗及與其有聯帶關係之製糖事業，爲本島農業經營之最有希望者，論者且認爲其價値超出台灣之上；因以日照及氣溫之關係，甘蔗成熟期間在西南部，可較台灣之需一年半者得縮短半年，且其所含糖分亦視台灣產者爲富，故日人之經營，亦特別努力，雖其成績，尙不足以發揮其特徵，然若再期數年，當不難獲優良之結果也。落花生與胡麻亦均爲海南島之重要農產，除供島上需要外，其種子果實及汕，均向香港廣東方面輸川，生產地點幾普及全島，產量甚豐，日人俱有新式製汕工廠之設置，更有助於油脂作物之推廣。棉一化因瓊島與世界產棉地帶（北美洲南部，印度北部，及埃及等）同在等溫，等雨量綫上，故亦爲棉花之適當栽植地，只以本島氣候，終歲溫和，予病蟲生活以便利，故日人試植埃及棉及美棉系統之優良品種，結果病害雖不甚烈，然蟲害猖獗，終罕優良成績，不過這些都是人力可以克服的困難，加以努力，當不雖予以驅除。他如黃麻，苧麻，雖栽植爲量不多，但如從事開墾，開廣栽植面積，加以品種之改良，適地之選定，則前途亦極有望。烟草之在本島栽培，歷史甚爲悠久，黃色佳種，早經輸入，然以栽植粗率，尙無充分成續，日本各開發公司，亦以試植地之未能養爲選擇，治安亦未獲成功，故終未獲確實成就，然專家莫不異口同　爲有望之事業也。</p>
<p>農業的基礎</p>
<p>園藝作物，本島四時溫暖，極適於熱帶果樹之栽培，北部地方冬季較爲寒冷之時期的僅一月餘，故頗適於亞熱帶及溫帶果樹之發育，若周年供給海口果品之永興市（在瓊崖北部，南部以崖縣爲果樹唯一主要產地。）誠東亞罕有之果樹聖地也。熱帶亞熱帶及溫帶之各種果品，本島幾漠不生產，故經營果樹園，實爲本島最有利的事業，若能善自把握時機，眞不難立致以互富也。本島主要果樹有柑，橋，楊梅，梅，桃，葡萄，李，石榴，枇杷，汕柑，楊桃，橄攬，荔枝，能眼，波籮蜜，芭蕉，風梨，汕梨，檬果等不下數十種，花目繁多，產量豐富，而關於品種之改良，新種之導入試植及病蟲害之防治，日人亦均已奠定良好基礎，再加研究，前途實未可限量也。</p>
<p>至於海南島森林，中部山間尙有不少原始森林，未經日人開發，嗣後，若政治安定，交通暢便，木島之林業與木業，均有極光明之前途，自無疑義。</p>
<p>農田水利爲農業之基礎，日人鑒其重要，特設水利專科，積極從事水利工程之調查，設計，施工等工作，其巳完成工程計四十七處，受益面積計七，一七一公頃，未完成工程共十六處，計劃而未施工之工程計二三處，均預傳於十年以內次第完成，果若成功，則不惟本島所引爲極端嚴重之糧食問題得以迎刃而解，即各項農作之增產，亦當隨之解決矣</p>
<p>農產加工乃將幾產品加以工業處理，以謀其適於利用並增加其價値者也。其中包括精米，製粉，製糖，榨油，釀造，罐頭製造等項，日人經營之農業公司中，加工事業莫不與農作之栽植相輔並進，不然如農業僅以供給原料爲目的，則乃古代之原始狀態之農業耳，其不合時代潮流顯而易見，但說來痛心，我國一般人士眛而不察，以爲農產加工或食品加工，即屬工業範圍，應由整個農業中脫離分化致造成此次接收時，將所有海南島農業公司，支離分解，不可收拾，實爲國家之大不幸。</p>
<p>去年八月勝利後，中央政府各部門次第派員來瓊接收，以受降接收機構分配辦法欠佳，致步驟凌亂，手足無措，以視日人之雖戰敗而辦理交代時條目分明，井然不紊，能不愧死！</p>
<p>寶貴勝利品</p>
<p>瓊崖爲一熱帶濃業資源地，故凡所開發，自應從農業入手而後由農業而漸進於工業，方爲發展實業應取之途徑，故日人經營之原有農業公司，實爲本島可寶貴之勝利品，果能善爲運用，則二十年後海南島實業之發達，當不難與今日台灣爭雄。蓋台灣在我國統治時代，其貧困固一如今日之海南島也。迨經日人五十年之經營，竟一躍而爲日本之生命綫，良以日人之發奮努力使然也。所可憾渚，日人在瓊所奠之大好基礎此次竟因不善保管，而遭自行破壞，實令人惋惜不止。爲今之計，亟宜收拾殘局，從事整頓，分別性質，以便國營民營之決定；凡此種種，當在良好政治環境下，友克奏效，故當本年春季　　設省之說，甚靠慶上，（一度盛傳曾養甫氏將出任　崖行政首長）其時一般關心海南島人土，莫不欣然色喜，寄與一綫希望，醫英因政治環境之改善，而可使海南島之開發，步上軌道。否則如今日情况，不惟廣東省政府鞭長莫及，無力過問，本島各機構亦復各自爲政，雜亂無章，而治安且無保障，更使一般有心赴瓊工作人士，裏定不前，自更邊論開發與建設等等。</p>
<p>本文係根據陳先生廿六日之講演及三日與記者之談話寫成，完稿以後，匆促付郵，致未再星陳先生修正，實深歉仄，若有錯誤，當由記者自負文賣。陳先生眞是有心人，當勝利之初，當局有意請陳先生出掌台灣林務；而陳先生學者本色，目光如炬避易就難，蹶往一般人所不層往之海南島，負起艱巨責任。一年以來，雖以客觀環境惡劣，致無法展其長才，使他極爲灰心；但陳先生以其觀感所得，已格續寫成不少有系統之文字。大部發表於東方　　，最近聞又寫成數十萬言之「海南島開發計劃」一書，稿巳殺青，不久當可出版，顯其早日問世爲出版界放一異彩，我國學者之研究海南島而且有系統的著述者，當以陳先生日爲第一人，這份實獻，彌足珍貴。（卅五年十二月八日於南京）</p>

<p>— 桂林廿一日航訊　本報駐桂記者梁小中</p>
<p>一年容易，春天過了，秋天過了，三百多個日子，又輕輕送入記憶底深海裏。幾家歡樂，幾家惑苦，看起來都不外是一片雲，一陣烟！把世界着得冷淡的人，往往就是被世界冷淡的人，沉靜的廣西，很少人會想到應該怎樣灣過一個元且，「新年」，在他們底眼裏也一樣要吃飯啊！</p>
<p>年關　起不得勁</p>
<p>年關在人們底心裏起不得勁，桂林市上機關衙門的算盤却打得迎天價響。結算預算鬧昏了窮官府的腦筋，省政府一開賬，且慢看明年，今年年底還弗曉得啷格辦，鈔票問題好不煩惱，好容易省主席飛了一越南京，借到廿六萬萬，才打發一年過去，一瞬眼又是新春「大吉」，卅六年的預算還短一截，於是乎情急智生，栽員減政之聲又聞風而起，澦計大年初一以後，到文昌門外吃飯的府吏們，五個要不見了一個，裁員的名單還沒公佈，小職員急得有如勢鍋上的螞蟻，度其心情，大有如商店老板歲晚請夥計吃一餐「無情飯」時那情景還要尷尬，被栽的人裁了便裁了，沒有什麼安插善後，拖兒帶女的還得施兒帶女，一家八口的沒是一家八口，最可悲的是骨肉裁不去，割不斷，要生活的還得生活，請問常除夕轉到元旦，一暗一明的時間，你能够聽得盡多少沉重的嘆息聲？</p>
<p>糧賦　一催一延</p>
<p>年年難過，年年要過，本來年窮歲晚，也就是困苦的總匯，誰打得通，誰便從重壓下面喘過一口氣來，然後又的要算來年的大難，可惜走得過年關的人少，走不過年關的多，眼望着臘戍已盡，總不禁想起了限年底完淸的糧賦，連日來田糧處大舉派員到谷縣坐催，各縣又派員到各鄕坐催，一把斧頭，一柄聲，一塊太片，連串起來便構成了一幅緊張的畫面，爲了行政，政府不能够沒有米，爲了沒有米，農民們忘記了政令，一催一延之閒，隱約中我總彷彿記得聽過了許多最不愉快的故事。然而，我不願意寫，一寫下來便是兩行眼淚……</p>
<p>减租　表面實行</p>
<p>减糧减租，農民得到甚麼益處？黃主席謁見蔣至席時，蔣主席訓示要徹底實行二五减租，但是一實行起來，有些縣分竟會報稱「全無佃主佃農」。甚至有些地方表面實行减租，佃主交還了佃農一部分租榖，等到督導員走了，佃農又把榖子担回佃主家裏，簡直是在做戲！</p>
<p>痛苦的事情愈多，荒唐的事情也愈多，兩週來，挂林的市面總可以看到一種對救濟工作人員不可抑壓的忿恨，從難民被趕看到救濟分署運來的臭米，再從臭米一磅秤尅扣災糧案，有時候感情衝看到腦滿腸肥的分署職員底僞造一動起來，我簡市想跑到這一羣混羣的面前，刮它兩個耳光！</p>
<p>難已　非憤塡膺</p>

<p>台東天龍橋之奇景（特派員江暮雲寄）</p>
<h3 id="c199">台東行　到花蓮港去 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 十八日台北航訊　本報特派昌江暮雲</p>
<p>東台灣考察團離開台東縣，是十二月八日的下午。臨別的前晚，他們特別在戲院裏召開了歡迎會，這個會在台東是光復後第一次盛會，因為政府人員很少來過，國內外的視察團更視東部爲禁區，他們渴念着政府的關切，正和渴望着太平洋的暖流一樣。</p>
<p>在這個會裏，我們看到了數千民衆的笑臉，和雷動似的呼聲，這正象徵合東民衆心底裏發出來的聲音！任處長在大衆之前宣佈了政府對東台灣開發的決心，也當傷替他們解決了返待建設的實際問題。我們更看到高山族男女靑年的舞蹈，他們以最興奮的情感最眞整的表演來迎接親察團，這是並不太單純的舞，有原始的自然味，但也帶有藝術味，一種尖銳和諧的四部合唱，使人忘記了她和他們原是高山同胞，音樂和舞蹈的天才，正渴待舞蹈和音樂家們的發掘，他們希望着戴愛蓮能到這個荒城裏來。</p>
<p>台東綫　颱風是最大威脅</p>
<p>從台東到花蓮港，這裏有一條鐵路，全長一七七公里，視察團決定啓行時，每日對開三班的火車，其中一輛貴賓汽汕火車已預定給視察團專用；我們很感興趣的在長途跋涉中能有一段更舒適的專車給我們享用。道條綫，在淸末僅長一百籽，現在有一七五。九公里，轄三十九站。</p>
<p>據鐵路委會正工程司張鐘崧的吿訴，給予台東綫最大的威脅破壞力最強的就是颱風，全錢通過一〇二條約溪流，最大約有三條，每年化費於維持和修理工程的，爲數可甚大，而影響着交通，最迅速的搶修，也得二三天，所以在強風季東部交通常易陷於停頓，但一千三百個員工，却充分表現着戰勝自然的力量。這些人員中，分配在沿綫各站，百分之九十七以上是本省人，站長都由他們祖任。最近交通處爲了維持他們的生活，不能不將票價稍予增加，以資挹注，事實上却仍舊是收支難能平衡，現月大台幣二六〇萬，支出却須六百餘萬，政府維護交通的苦心，在人馬稀落的東部，更可看得到的。</p>
<p>車子以六十碼的速率，穿過各個小站，站長和員工都立正着表示敬意，車過東部竹田時，天冒着雨，近山是被低氣壓的雨雲吞沒了，風從溪流和縱谷間吹過寂寥的曠野，吹過蔗田，吹過低矮的木屋，每個人都感受着寒意，不得不添上件毛衫！</p>
<p>運輸網　東部收入僅十萬</p>
<p>和記者並肩坐的通運公司總經理徐上珍，他一提到台東的運轍就說：政府明知台東綫的運輸要虧本，但可不能和商人比，看見虧本就不辦！通運公司實際上是擔負貨物聯運的組織，只要客貨交給了它，就可以包運到指定地區。收手續費每噸最高不過十餘一元，損耗超過協定數額，就得賠一償，而運費却由公司先行代付的一，可說是負責運輸。</p>
<p>該公司全部有三千多員工，分佈在東台灣約有三百多人。在全省運輸上來看台東，它實是一個瘤，全部總月入台幣二千萬，可是東部包括羅東宜蘭在內，僅五·六十萬元；台東。花蓮港則不足十餘萬元。再以運輸量來說，戰前最繁榮時期每天火車貨物運輸上下約二萬餘噸，接收前一度降低到每天二千多噸，現在已增加到八九千噸，東部始終保持着數千噸。從台東到花蓮港，主要的運輸是糧食熙，過去白蘇澳到花蓮港，三個月間交通斷經時，完全仰賴於每小時行九碼的台通一號和帆船，不但維持貨運，而且維持了客運。接着他很高興的說，目前東部的運輸，收支若可保持平衡，而環島運輸網也已完成，今後要是台東定期航錢，對東部糖·水泥·鹽·食糧的運輸，當可暢通多多，不致單憑公路卡車的運輸，使產地與實銷地的價格相去太遠；東部民衆是不一能再承受因運輸而遭政的額外負一担的！</p>
<p>環島綫　工程費需廿萬萬</p>
<p>合灣四面環海，海岸綫計長一·一三九·二四三公里，敷設於島。北部及台西平原以迄南部的鐵路綫，和各生產事業私設鐵路組成鐵路網，合東鐵路是建於中央山脈與海岸山脈閒的台東平原，與西綫形成環烏鐵路；因爲中部叢山峻嶺，中央橫斷的鐵路和公路，都還沒有建立起來。</p>
<p>日本人原先築成從屏東到台東知本間的南部橫斷公路，全長一三七·四公里；據費局長說，這條公路日人曾通過一輛工程卡車，軍用車就從沒有駛過，路基大部是崩壞。在整個台省交通來說，該綫實無重大意義，日本人主要是怕盟軍在南部登陸，這裏是一條可以逃生的退路，實際上繞過最南端的公路，在全部里程上，不過多十餘公里，要是再化這筆鉅款來建築公路，是得不償失的。還有中橫斷公路，從台中經埔里到富士四十一公里，現在可以通車，從富里橫越崇山胡東部鋼門七十公里，還待修理，估計需費九萬萬台幣，目前該局已決定先修銅門吊橋，因爲強風坍毀了橋面，鐵索依然可予利用，所以亟待修理，並巳決定明年起修竣，要是這條中部公路打通以後，穿過中央山脈至台東，就無需繞道本烏南部或北部了。</p>
<p>其實東部的交通命脈，完全繫於環島鐵路的速接。日本人在羅東到太平山的鐵路終點土塲，穿過太平山，南湖大山，中央尖山折入淸水山而到花運港迤北的三棧，這相距百餘公里的山綫，過去他們已經化了一筆測量費，照張工程師的計劃，六年前日人準備一千萬元，目前深二百倍，爲二十億元，較築臨海綫省一百十八億元，預計測量一年後，先籌設輕便綫開始鋪建。任處長是深知這條綫是東台灣的命脈，他雖沒有把握能決定這個擁有鉅大數字的工程費，但却竭力鼓勵地方熟悉路徑的人，能陪着交通處特派的高雄港務局長林則彬賣地察勘，抗戰時他曾測量了叙滇鐵路，相信這條綫的初步調查是可以獲得圓滿結果的。任處長對記者說，公署本年度開始竹東鐵路的建設，要是環島鐵路能完成的話，陳長官在台灣的聲譽將是永垂千古，因爲五十年日人不能完成的工程，他能完成它!</p>
<p>南海上　火燒島與紅頭嶼</p>
<p>在東部我們瞭望着太平洋，用望遠鏡看，離二十九籽的火燒島的斷崖絕壁，淸顯地表露在眼前，紅頭嶼離台東直南七十米籽，這兩個南海孤島都屬於台東縣轉。因爲視察團日程決定，遺憾的使我們不能實地踏查。</p>
<p>紅頭嶼週圍三八　，住着阿眉族一二七三人，離台東海程八小時，據王科長煜仁說，氣象局會派員在島上工作，抵達時大雨傾盆，全身淋漓，不一刻，天却放晴，烈日當空，衣衫都晒乾了。這裏因爲多風，房屋很低，平面看是平房，實際上却是掘坑似的三層樓：下層土准，上蓋茅草，冬天取暖，中層是春秋使用，上層適於夏季。</p>

<h3 id="c200">山陜高原間的YVA　壺口·龍門 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 十四日航訊　本報西安記者李馳</p>
<p>水利專家薩凡奇博士一行十三日由河南飛寗夏，很少人知道他中途曾停留過西安西南四十公里的鄂縣機場，勾留過一刻，而在「山陝高原」上留下第一個脚印。近來航郵班機少，說不定這篇通訊寄到上海時，他們一行已經飛回陝西，參觀過省境內水利建設的成就，和勘察過許多處有利用價値的水源地。前者包括灌溉渠受益區，後者主要是壺口至龍門問六十五公里的黃河河槽。而實鷄以東十五公里的寳鷄峽，也順便一看。</p>
<p>水利驕人的兩點</p>
<p>談水利，陝省有兩點足以驕人：其一，着手早，歷史悠長；其二，有實効，年有改進。像久遠年代建築的精巧水渠至今猶存，李儀祉氏畢生爲陝省水利終而獻出了生命，幸而他的「第二代」正繼承着，目下省內有長度達一百二十公里的水渠，溉灌了一百六十多萬市畝的受益耕地（主要是棉田和糧田）。除了道些，省內還有不大爲人熟悉的三千多匹馬力水力發電，分佈在陝南之南鄭和實鷄之東的郿縣，然而，薩凡奇這次並不是爲了觀光這些才有此行，他的更大的任務，在乎厘訂一個治理黃河的綜合大計，包括消極的防止「黃患」，和積極的利用水力和疏通航運。換言之，要把災害和收益同時作剪形的减與增。</p>
<p>黃河自河曲至潼關，正是山西，陝西的天然省界，然而這段六百公里長一公里寬的河値旣不便通航，而且蘊藏有無限動力的黃水就白白的讓它在下游到處鬧水災。請詳細看看地圖上代表黃河這一條墨繪雙勾的淺藍色絲帶，到了陝西宜川和山西吉縣之閒，就縮窄爲一條黑綫？這個窄口就是下文所提及的壺口。再往南走，到了陝西韓城和山西河津之間，亦即下文述及之龍門，才再决放寬，而接合汾河口。在壺口到龍門之間，黃河河槽大爲縮窄。滾滾河水雖有排山倒海的威力，亦僅能汹湧於窄的山谷間，而谷愈窄水力亦愈大。這一段河道，在國父遺敎中已述及利用作爲水電廠，「白煤」，與長江三峽和廣東西江相提並重，可惜數十年來還是「紙上談兵」。將來假如有一天順利地完成，那無疑是山陝高原間的第二「揚域安」（YVA）據最樂觀的估計：它可以電化陝，晋，豫，魯四省和「隴海」等三條鐵路，灌慨四百萬畝耕地，和沿綫分段通航。還有令人最驚異的功能：只要在該段內選擇適宜地點建築一道高僅一百五十公尺的蓄水壩，即可把上流一百二十億立方公尺的黃水，積蓄得涓滴不漏，半世紀以內，其下游決無洪水之患！</p>
<p>我們的水利專家今次所期待於薩凡奇的，就是讓他在各種現成約有關資料中，加上實地勘踏，提出他寶貴的意見。</p>
<p>壺口窄流與激瀑</p>
<p>壺口在宜川縣東西十五公里，黃河到了道裏由四五百公尺的河槽漸縮窄爲二三百公尺，兩岸陡坡不高，僅十多公尺，不過河床底下有條長的一公里的深溝，其寬度和深度均約二三十公尺，上游的黃水流到這裏，統統流入這條深溝即壺口，激水如霧，有如飛瀑，吼聲似雷，確是奇觀！前人說這里「九里三分深」，勘察後已知過度的誇張，每於十一月至春三月，這六七百公尺寬的瀑布，都冰結如鏈。另據一九〇五年一個外國人的記錄，說當年五月，冰柱仍未溶化，這情景，使人想起「只今河畔冰開日，正是長安花落時」的古人詩句。冰消後壺口再度飛瀑，但洪水時則無此現象。深溝的下端附近，有兩小石島突出水面數公尺，名曰「孟門」從前有人計劃過利用這小島來築蓄水壩。</p>
<p>壺口之引人注目的是這一股窄流激瀑，有可能利用爲水力發電，據地質調查所較舊的調查（二十一年八月），壺口有八千以上秒立方公尺的流量。據另一報吿，說壺口的水位差約二十公尺。前黃河水利委員會李畫田氏最樂觀的佔計：認爲「在壹口修築五十五公尺高壩，即可得三百萬匹馬力。但另外一個極保守的佔計則說僅有三十萬匹馬力。此外尙有多人各作不同的佔計。另據今年十月「黃河治本研究團」和陝省水利局，最新的復勘，其結論對前人所佔計大有修正。其中關文啓氏且認爲「壺口純係河底深溝得名，在水中以下雖能有數公尺或十數公尺之「跌差」可能發生數萬匹馬力，然深溝狹窄，無法利用，即或設法引水出槽，而下游承力處深在河床下，施工管理，絕對困難。孟門島太小，對高壩響水，毫無意義。綜上二處，地質條件及河道情形，均不足爲築高壩地址。」壺口結冰期太長，亦是一缺點。</p>
<p>截至目前止，綜合「治本團」團長張含英陝西水利局長劉鐘瑞和新任山西水利局的曹瑞芝諸專家意見，大體上已一致認爲壺口的價値不及下文所述的龍門。</p>
<p>龍門筑壩的估計</p>
<p>黃河過了孟門以後道放寬七八百公尺，到了石門陝，河身漸漸窄到百公尺左右，兩岸峭壁也有百公尺高其後在三里浪處再放寬，到龍門和禹門口又縮窄而成六十公尺的窄口。這一段黃河，水利專家仍正在熟烈的研討着。</p>
<p>據最新的復勘結果，關文啓氏認爲石門峽或三里浪處都具有建築蓄水壩的條件，而以石門峽爲駁。「治本團」大體上也認爲石門峽附近的價値最大。據關氏佔計：建築高一百五十公尺的築水壩，即可積貯一百三十億立方公尺的黃水。以黃河在龍門一帶每年平均流量爲四百秒立方公尺計，全年也不過流下一百二十六億立方公尺的黃水，這道水壩築成以後，當然可以把上流的水完全積貯備用。不過地層底下有無漏洞，尙待證實。</p>
<p>又據歷年來黃河水文記載，最大洪水爲一萬八千秒立方公尺以洪水連續兩天作爲假設的數字，在這水壩築成後的水庫，每上部十公尺即可容納一决有如上述的大洪水。推而論之，數十年內，其下游將無水患。黃河在禺門附近的輸沙量爲百分之二，以此推算，這水壩可有五十年壽命。</p>
<p>假如利用這蓄水來發電，將發生多大的電量呢？因爲諸專家所根據的數字不同，其結論亦有極大的差異。關氏估計可產生「三十五萬匹馬力，電化山陝二百英里以內的地區，灌溉四百萬畝耕地」。曹端芝氏則以爲可得一百三十萬匹馬力，灌溉兩千萬畝耕地，和電化「平漢」「同蒲」「隴海」三錢，輸電遠至平，津，天水，和山東一帶。「黃委會」另一估計最小，僅三十萬匹馬力。</p>
<p>不過我們相信，稍待薩凡奇氏一行視察歸來，一定會立刻校正上述參差的數字，而獲到近似的結論。</p>

<h3 id="c201">論詩韻 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 黃樓</p>
<p>舊詩韻是許多人懷疑的。這自然是過去的事物，但是有他的演變，有他的歷史，有他的作用與價値。我們近幾百年來通用的詩韻，是金朝平水王文郁編的，所以通稱爲平水韻，他何以能有這樣的權威呢？因爲他已經把宋朝廣韻的二百六部歸併爲一百七部。例如廣韻是一東二冬三鐘四江五支六脂七之八微，而平水是一東二冬三江四支五微，簡單多了。但是其原則仍守展韻之舊，而廣韻又出於唐孫恤的唐韻，唐韻又本於隋陸言的切韻。隋代是南方文化向北推移的時代，將永嘉以後漸潰胡風的中原文化重新整理支配，其中語音一方面須容納黃河長江珠江三流域的特性，兼收並畜，不容偏廢。切韻這部書確是時代產物，能與政治相呼應，使中國南北漢胡之閒有了一種溝通融會的工具，決不是無意義的。語言是無理性之物，只可拿韻書來遷就語言，不能靠韻書來統一語言，雖然韻書是各處公認的標準，而事實上有許多稍爲偏僻的地方就不能與實際語音相符，所以全唐詩話上有關於胡曾的一段笑話，胡曾是現在的湖南人，他就不能分別『石』與『十』『陰與因』，而在唐朝的確普通人都知道這兩個字不能同樣念法的，石是Shik，十是Shit，陰是Yim，因是Yin，於今廣東人却還分別得很淸楚。大約那時照韻書的音蹟的，頗似現代的普通話——國語，讀書作文及一班社會上是可以行得通的。</p>
<p>看唐韻分部那樣的細密，足見不是鹵莽從事，而必曾下過工夫狠費事的折衷分析，才有這個成就，標準雖然細密，但是用在韻文上面，並不十分嚴格，只要在大原則上不錯而已，雖以律賦律詩那樣的謹嚴，也仍可通融的。在實行起來，他們並不感覺束縛太甚。</p>
<p>明太祖曾經編過洪武正韻，想把許多好像不合時代的讀音改正，使其能更適於實用，但是失敗了，結果還是通行平水韻，一直未改。以明太祖這樣好自作聰明不滿意現狀的人而不能奏效於韻書之改革，是什麼道理呢？當時找不出一個更好的標準，以主觀的見解隨便亂改是不行的，你念起順口，就不管別人順口不順口，那如何可以呢？而且字音與字形也關繫，隨便一改，牽動就太多了。</p>
<p>不錯，在事實上宋朝人塡詞已經不遵守舊的韻舊，而有所謂詞韻了，但是宋人塡詞的習慣只是怕為韻所拘束而只取個大槪，讀或唱起來的時候，恐怕要稍爲改變本音，不然，像支微齊三韻的字押在一起，如何能念得順口呢？又如宋朝的福建人作賦塡詞，以何與高老與鎖同押，我們念起來，也非學着福建腔不行。</p>
<p>韻書固然本來遷就語言而作，但讀韻文的音恐怕也要稍爲遷就韻書一點。</p>
<p>平水韻的分部是狠科學的，以羅馬字解釋之，的略如下：</p>
<p>東　ong　冬　jing　江　ong　支　i　徵　ei　魚　iu　虞</p>
<p>ou　齊佳灰　ai　眞　in　文　en　元　eun　寒　oen　删　an</p>
<p>先　ien　蕭看　iao　豪　ao　歌　o　麻　a　陽　ang　庚　eng</p>
<p>靑　ing　蒸　êng　尤　iou　侵　im　覃　am　鹽　iem　咸　iam</p>
<p>以上平韻上去入倣此</p>
<p>入聲韻分三部，（一）以k收聲（二）以t收聲（三）以p</p>
<p>收聲，粵語完全與此相同。</p>
<p>能把分韻的原則弄淸楚，於了解各處的方言有益處，做一個中國人，總應當懂得幾稱重要方言。所以韻也不可不知。舉一個例，知道齊韻的字在古音在奧奧語，都讀ai母，我們就知道廣東話的妻是tsai題是tai雞是gai知道寒韻是oen删韻是an，我們就知道吳語讀官與關完與環干與閒是不會同音的。</p>

<p>— 耶草</p>
<p>一天早晨，下着迷濛的細雨，路上很滑，在蘇州河某座橋中間，立着一個十二三歲的孩子；面貌靑秀，形像贏弱，孤獨的，仰望着霧裏的雲：赤着脚，穿了一條紫色的裙。</p>
<p>當我走近他時，他轉過臉來，露出無疵的微笑，純潔的，絕無慾求或食圖什麼的含意，淡漢的瞧着我。</p>
<p>他有一雙美麗的眼睛，圓大而有光芒，裏面充滿了智　與歡樂，彷彿還不懂什麼呌憂鬰和哀傷！</p>
<p>除了臉龐，他的兩耳，頸子，腿，手和脚，像是長年不洗一般，烏黑的，結上一層齷齪的　　　指甲長長的，長在枯瘦的手指尖上。頭髮不十分長，也不太亂，祇是頭頂上相當的骯髒；雨滴如同露珠樣的釘在髒的地方。</p>
<p>那條裙子是出色的，週身只有它算最乾凈。上邊穿着黑色的襯衣，外面罩了一件破舊的灰法關絨的馬夾。</p>
<p>傍晚，我看見他竚立在橋的另一旁。</p>
<p>三天之後，我們好像有點熟識，我又從他身邊經過時，他忽然笑迎着我，滿不在乎對我說：</p>
<p>「給我兩百塊錢！」</p>
<p>我却給他一張五百的，他接過去，飛快的跑開了。在人羣中，消逝了他的影子。聽他的聲調，看那股崛强勁兒，他多半是個男孩！</p>
<p>有兩天沒有看見他。</p>
<p>第三天，他又出現了；他不再立在那兒，從　這邊到橋那邊，飛速的來回跑着。他像是巳經搭上了帮，在搶着推過橋的三輪軍了。我心裏爲他慶幸，他總算有了職業。</p>
<p>他理了髮，裙子洗得格外的紫，比先前乾凈了許多；他笑嘻嘻的活着，還沒有學會憂響，在他那純潔的小心上。</p>
<p>一次，他推一輛三輪車過橋，坐車的人零錢不多，祇給他四十塊錢，他愉快的接了過來；他旁邊一個較大的孩子，伸手奪過錢，一下損到他臉上，罵進：</p>
<p>「沒出息，四十塊錢好幹煞！」</p>
<p>「你不要我要！」他躱閃着，笑迷迷的喃喃着，將票子一張張的拾起來。迎面碰到我，他現出熟悉的微笑，一溜烟跑到橋那頭去。</p>
<p>天寒了。因爲飲食不慎，我患了將行十日的惡性瘧疾；病中，我懷念着這個穿紫色裙的孩子；我決定病愈後找他談談，閒一問他的身世；這孩子，太可人意了！</p>
<p>吃過早飯，我便向那座橋走去。在中途，一個封閉着的倉庫的門檻外邊，偎了一羣人，愁眉苦臉，向地下瞧望着。</p>
<p>「夜裏凍死的，昨天還活活的……」有誰說。</p>
<p>從人縫中望進去，看見一個小尸挺在那兒，上身蓋一些殘破的棉絮，臉上仍舊掛着一絲微笑，僵硬的腿上裏着一條紫色的裙。</p>

<p>一，砂巖</p>
<p>江水低落的時候，棕黑的砂巖，像成羣龍最慢慢地把脊梁浮起，曝曬太陽。爲什麼不去冬眠？難道在等待另一個冰河時期？棕黑的砂巖又像水仙底球根，潔白的沙灘把它們埋種穩穩，碧綠的江水把它們淺淺浸潤，還多久才是它們發芽底時令？還多久它們便同時盡然破裂，開放出滿江花朶絢爛如錦；一朶保像華蓋撐着給縴夫休息，給那匆匆的船隻在蔭下寄碇？</p>
<p>棕黑的砂巖在江水低落的時候，祇有默默的永鳥在那兒淹留。</p>
<p>二，卵石</p>
<p>無量數卵石耀着早晨底太陽，是誰昨夜把天河裏無量數明星，一網打來傾在這碧色的江上？或者，明星是卵石黯澹的投　？卵石，聽任着喜怒無常的江流，在冬季日夜向它們嘆息哀哀；可是春夏，踐踏着它們急走，狂奔，怒吼出聯珠迸發的洪雷。於是完全失掉了崢嶸的頭角，卵石底本質却還是一般堅硬；雖然無力禁阻那麼碾和剝削，時間刦略去終證明僅屬外形。</p>
<p>耀着早晨底太陽江上的行人，願你也有本質和時間抗衡！</p>

<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>機中無聊，各人都就着燈光，閱讀報紙解悶。比及大家發現了這封短簡之後，都好像注射了一針興奮劑似的，頓時活動起來，却又因爲機聲隆隆，不便談話，只好互相指着報紙打手式；有的用筆把這短簡圈了起來，互相傳觀，有的更加好事，竟把短簡栽下身邊取下機上裝置的傳話板，上面有現成紙夾和白頁紙，把短簡夾在上面，在白頁上寫下了白己的尊見，互相傳閱。其中竟有一個冒失傢伙，帶着幾分幸災樂禍的心理，把報紙和傳話板搜集起來，一壘遞給鶴見。鶴見看過短簡，又把傳話板上的意見，一條一條，細心談下去。</p>
<p>「我要是武士道子弟，情願捨了性命，也要乘了降落傘下機，趕到別府，同那些挑戰者較量較量」。有人這們寫着。</p>
<p>「不能，對方敢挑戰，定是『道』裏的能手，鬥起來的話，怕沒有把握吧」！……另一人這們寫着。</p>
<p>「不對，我認爲勝敗沒有關係，挺身出塲，那是一個武士道英勇的表現——無論如何，總比一走了事的怯懦行徑，亦高尙得多」……</p>
<p>「我認爲這般挑戰的人，豈有此理；人家做官，是拿本領換得來的，不間這本領是屬於那一類的。如今就時他們戰鬥勝了，做官的還是做官，上司不見得把他降級，或者去議。然而戰勝了的，也不見得就能獲到官職哩，哈哈，馬鹿……加」！</p>
<p>鶴見承那冒失鬼的好意，把這些妙文給他看了，當時表示多謝了承他關注的好意，元自仍舊默默地坐在那裏，也不去理會那些笨貨的動作。他低頭沉思，的莫幾分鐘光景，忽地搯記事手册，和那枝經過別府秘書檢騐過了的活動鉛筆，匆匆寫了兩行，把身邊電鈕一按。飛機上的勤務來了，鶴見就把寫好的條子，撕下交給勤務，故意高聲說了「急電」兩個字，勤務接了字條，應聲而去。</p>
<p>同行那幾個傢伙，看了鶴見這個舉動，當然又是一番騷動，當然又有了許多揣測，簡直把這件事，看爲比自己打了勝仗，擢升了等級，還要關心。又那裘知道這一切一切，乃是鶴見今晚搜索那「七封秘緘」計劃的一部分行動呢！</p>
<p>鶴見那「急電」上寫的什麼？</p>
<p>「參謀本部電訊司司長鈞鑒，機上偶閱今晚第二次戰訊號外，獲悉少數不逞之徒，向職示威挑戰，無聊舉動，本不足計較，惟匪徒指定首相鈞座別府，恐係醉翁之意，別有危險企圖，千祈分神，轉達警戒別動隊當値注意。職，公務火急，未能分身與宵小周旋，似欠勇氣，然實亦不府意氣用事，因私鬥而誤公務。惟因此而驚及首相鈞座，職不勝惶恐之至。愚忱祈轉致各通訊社，及有關各方。鶴見玉叩」。</p>
<p>這時飛機自東京起程，向神戶長畸這條航綫前進，已有二十多分鐘，飛去不少路程，座中各人，還在興緻勃勃，運用傳話板，各抒高見的當口，陡覺機身，有些特別震蕩，似乎在打小圈子。衆人方在驚詫，瞥見那位副司機，從機首小門鑽了出來，神色緊張，手上擎着一張紙，好像電報行箋，向大衆揚了一揚，順手遞給第一篗座位上的人；意思呌大家傳觀。</p>
<h3 id="c207">牆 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 胡朔</p>
<p>在我們古老的歷史上，僅僅記載着有巢氏發明「構木爲集」的故事，却沒有提及起牆的來源。太古時期的人民，當他們結束了山野的原始生活，用薄薄的木片築起溫暖的「巢」時，他們的內心起始是滿意愉快的，然而來一陣暴風雨，隨着洪水的泛濫，木巢變成浮船，他們又埋怨着有巢氏道位發明家的低能了。</p>
<p>人類畢竟是最聰明的動物，他們終於用智懸征服了自然，突砍了生活的障礙，不知道從什麼年代起，他們又發明了牆，從此人類的生活又向文明推進了一步，他們用灰褐的磚片黏着白色的灰土，在自已的周圍築起高高的山崖似的牆壁。於是人們不再懼怕水災了，生活如一堆彎彎曲曲的樹根，他們鑽在牆洞裏，活在泥土上，日子過得一天比一天的安定穩固了。</p>
<p>牆，給人們帶來了溫暖和恬靜，在圍牆中，人們一代一代地活下來，他們給圍牆砌成各式各樣的姿勢，途上光怪陸離的美麗的色彩。他們依賴着牆的圍護，在深遠的歲月裏，抗拒了一串風暴的日子，從老祖宇一直到年幼的兒孫。</p>
<p>彷彿草原上的一粒星火，不知是在迷霧的早晨，抑是暗黑的黃昏；牆，在這無邊的曠野上，偷偷地稠密地爲成千萬的人們矗建起來。一道一道地圍着，一排一排地連毗着，像長長的城堡，像綿延不斷的山巓。……</p>
<p>從那一次以後，草原不再像沙漠般的寂寞，無盡數的人們，爲了自私的慾望，在大地的每個角落，舉起千萬條胳膊，築起牆來，又爲了它的坍圯，再在瓦礫堆旁有力地修建，組暴的嗓子野默似的呼嘯！汗的交流，力的匯聚，城鎭給人們建成了，都市的層層高大的圍牆也出現了，在每條牆邊，沿着縫隙，到處沸騰着喧囂，貪婪的笑，荒唐的夢囈，狼狗的呌吠和沉鬱的呻吟。……</p>
<p>人類的聰慧也許正是愚蠢罷，喜悅的希求換來的往往是悲哀的絕望！當第一次這山崖似的堅固的牆在泥土上矗立時，發明家也許曾興奮得發在。在嘴角綴上猙獰似的微笑。這是征服自然的成功，大地的人們將接踵地效仿他的傑作，在每個角落普遍地砌起牆來。頭項上不再挨着風雨，身體也不再寒冷，從此可以有了安息的地方。</p>
<p>可是發明家却沒有料到，人類有了牆，却也從此像牢不可破的洪溝似的隔絕了一切，模倣着築牆的人們，也更沒想到，爲了找尋溫暖，却爲自己的周遭打起柵欄，厭惡古老的生活畏懼風雨的吹打，結果却生活得更苦悶，人與人分隔了，圍牆把他們割開，把他們牢牢鎖住，像無數的囚犯似的，人們沒有了自由！</p>
<p>牆，殘酷地隔絕了一切，撕碎了人與人之間友誼……</p>
<p>人類究竟是自私的，他們中間爲了從牆邊覓取各人的幸福，他們中間不斷地排演着鬼技和鬥爭，他們重復暴露出原始的獸行忘記了都屬同類，忘記了「人性」！</p>
<p>隨着時代的演變，牆一年年多了，遮蔽了人的眼睛，變成黑茫茫的一片。</p>
<p>就是這樣地，不知從何時起，直到現在，牆給人毋無情地籠上一層濃厚的悲哀，像高山的霧永遠在那兒凝結。</p>
<p>但却沒有一個人像在人似的，勇敢地來一次「試鍊」，舉起他的拳頭向任何一道圍牆衝擊！……</p>

<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>我們讀了關於中國中央兩公司三架客機同日遇難的報道，一面悲悼，一面不無有點憤慨！悲悼渚，在罹惟難之慘；而憤慨者。何以江灣機塲地面盲目降落的設備不能取得聯絡？談華華機塲又何以無此種設備？</p>
<p>中國航空公司的兩隻飛機，在上海市空盤旋達三小時三十分鐘之久，請讀者閉目瞑想一下，常時機中人等，是一種什麼樣的心理狀態，誰不求生？這生死一髪的掙扎，人間悲慘能有逾於此者嗎？而中央航空公司的一機，强行降落墮毀於江灣張家宅，也同樣是逼至最後關頭，不得已而出此的。</p>
<p>我們知道中國與中央兩航空公司的機塲在龍華，各機其所以羣趨江灣者，爲了那里有盲目降落的設備，然而那是軍用機塲，且爲美軍管理，其缺乏平時的聯絡，自在意料之中，而此次各機先後求救於江灣機塲，除中國一機外，其它均未能脫險，其中是否另有別情，頗値得我們探討。龍華旣是兩公司的主要機塲，又爲什麼沒有此項設備？在此，我們不得不爲死難者憤慨！</p>
<p>往渚已矣，來者可追，我們現在有理山，更有權利請求航空公司充實設備，必須達到百分之百的安全，否則，在國人一向對於「飛航是危險的」這一觀念尙未打破前，反更加重，對於中國航空事業的前途，實在不堪想像的了。</p>

<p>雞犬不寧</p>
<p>據說：去年屬鷄年，鷄啼夭亮，所以天就亮了，皆大歡喜。但是，今年肖犬，鷄年與犬年一連起來，變了「雞犬不寗」，以是「劫收」在前，「舞弊」在後，子彈橫飛，物價亂跳，亂七八糟，昏天黑地。明年如何？拭目俟之！</p>
<p>去年比際</p>
<p>去年年底，金價八萬元，美鈔一千四百元，一年之中計漲了四倍有餘，五倍不足。</p>
<p>去年年底，米價七千元，今年年底，米價七萬元，多了一個圈！</p>
<p>去年年底，乘電車，不問路長路短頭等三等，一律法幣五元，今年現在最高票價達四百元，漲了八十倍！</p>
<p>買一件司麥脫襯衫的價錢，在去年歲末可買到一打；但是把去年買一件司麥脫襯衫的價錢，到令年今日只好買毛巾一條。</p>
<p>美鈔走紅</p>
<p>去年現在，鈔票花樣繁多：有法幣，有「中儲券」，有關金票，數起鈔票來可眞不大容易。今年，有錢人志不在此，腦筋蓋已動到「美鈔」上去也！</p>
<p>腦壳加價了</p>
<p>理髮一次，法幣三千元。若在去年，這數目還折合「中儲券」六十萬元，而這六十萬元「中儲券」，却還是曾經被迫用一百二十萬元法幣去換得來的。那麼豈不是現在理髮一次，合計法幣一百二十萬元嗎？</p>

<p>「葬禮稅」：行於羅馬尼亞，最高額爲三千元。</p>
<p>「頭銜稅」：西班牙的「良稅」，專向有爵位的人征收，一個勳爵每年需納稅數千元。</p>

<h3 id="c212">叫化子的組織　21賣藝求乞　（下） <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 黃嘉談</p>
<p>（十三）「開大門」——在丐帮求乞的苦肉計中，以「開大門」帮為最慘酷。所有製皮出血的驚險勾當，都是歸納於本門類裏。本帮又分別爲「紅杠」，「礦坐」，「針穿」三種派別。「紅杠」是在頭額上插着一把剃頭刀，深入皮肉寸許。外塗鮮猪血，自然猙獰可怖。「確坐」是磕在石板地上，磕頭磕得額破血流，使路人觸目驚心而給他錢。「針穿」是用一把長鋼針穿入手臂以示人。此項「開大門」幫丐，他們認定關老爺是他們的老祖師。大概是因爲關公會請華陀割臂療傷而面不改色，足以使人肅然起敬。所以他們每次出門，必先向關帝廟燒香，帮中稱爲「拜爺」。</p>
<p>（十四）「快慢跑」——那些無藝可賣的起碼丐流，他們祇好沿門托缽，苦意求乞，爲丐帮中最下級的傢伙，其行徑分爲「快走」「慢走」二種。「快走」帮走上門來，祇限說「求討一個」。店家給他錢拔脚就走，不給也就滾開跑第二家。該帮採取「寸陰是惜」主義，絕不空耗時間。「慢走」帮走上店門，侢像呆鳥一般站牢不動。不給錢打發是決不肯滾蛋的。店家逢到此輩的「長期抵抗」，如果負氣不給，丐洗永遠呆立不動，如果歷時過久方才給付，却非多給不可了。因爲丐流認爲躭擱下來的時間，須由店家負責。</p>
<p>（十五）「假分娩」——丐帮中除男丐努力要錢外，其家屬中的女丐也不甘坐食，一有機會便也向街頭發動攻勢。最普通的是表演街頭產十的活劇。表演之先，丐婦須先將猪血塗滿了稻草及衣服，在大淸早倒臥在里弄門外，懷中抱了一個甫經落地的血淋淋小孩，立刻吸引了附近的路人，丐婦便以呻吟聲裝做甫做產婦的樣子。這時附近的女太太們聞訊趕來，大家引起同情心，紛紛佈施。帮中人稱爲「跨血」。但欲表演此活劇時要先有一個新鮮的活小孩，須是剛分娩的眞嬰兒。在不同的地段可以繼續表演三數决。等到分娩三四日後便易被人們看出了破綻，不能再做了。</p>
<p>（十六）「假和尙」——丐流做充和尚，身穿僧衣，背着菩薩，挨戶募化香金。類此的冒牌傢伙，最足為佛門之累。但一般信佛虔誠的老太太們，却都急於佈施，不願查究其來歷。講藏誨盜，其此之請乎。</p>
<p>（十七）「手代足」——殘　乞丐兩足不善於行，結果祇好以手代足，手上拿着兩隻本地墊地行走求乞。但此類眞貨少而冒牌貨多。眞是虛虛實實，無從究詰呢！</p>
<p>（十八）「走雙敲」——丐流沿涂擊鼓求乞，以三根棍子打着鼓，摸仿着花鼓調，或口唱順流道情調。在農曆年底和新正期間，尤爲此輩活動的吉日。其乞討花樣繁多，但不脫三棍擊鼓的老本行。太帮便是江湖十八齣的殿軍。</p>

<p>— 慧</p>
<p>方塊漢字之需要改革，不必多辯。問題是如何改革，即是：用那一種新式樣文字來代替。半世紀以來，我們先後看到前賢想盡種種方法，其間包括了模倣日文的「假名」，併音字，簡筆字，基本漢字，注音符號，國語羅馬字，拉丁化新文字，……一直到最近又因有人使用「　」字之類的複音字。但我認爲：一切企圖保存方塊字形的四方方，不論方案如何，其終結必定失敗。</p>
<p>假如上述的前提是對，那末，今天之有人舊事重提的創製複音字，我以爲：這並不是「嘗試」，而是失敗的再現，是精力的浪費。</p>
<p>或許有人以灶定友氏創製那「囗」形內藏個一筆也不少的「書」字，作爲一「書館」的複音字來反辯。但我也想提出證據，十多年前杜氏發刊一本小册子，徵求各方面對於「圖書館」三字合戲一字的意見時，這小册中亦主張「博牧院」「美術館」一類詞兒也從新創造「複音字」，一如「圖書館」之縮下一個「書」字放在「四不透風」的框子裘那</p>
<p>這提議提出了，十多年來我却再沒有在第二個地方看到第二個「複音字」。</p>
<p>相反的，我祗記得前時杜氏做館長的國立中山大學圖書館的門首，還是用「圖書館」三字。當年又有人提議過，說雙字或三字的人名，不妨也合製成一個方塊字，但杜定友氏前兩年印行的書本，還是端端正正的寫上「杜定友」三字，不缺一筆。</p>
<p>甲骨，鐘鼎，魏碑，……你儘可寫成條幅在室內獨自欣賞；但提議用甲骨文來印行日報，那除非是瘋子。</p>
<p>一個圓圈藏個三角，你儘可自由的稱他做什麼牌　子，作爲商標，誰也沒有權利來千涉。但是必定想法子把這圖形圖案配以讀音，當一個單字以代表平面幾何書上「圓周內切正三角形」，那是吃苦不討好的事。如此之類的事情作爲一種廣吿宣傳方法則可以，真正認為改革漢字之一法，則未免過甚。</p>
<p>試想想：「金不換」，「紫鷄狼毛」，「白全毛」，「小紅尖」……這麼幾千百種毛筆名，若然「平等地」各各起個「合成字」，將是一個什麼世界！排字盤增加多少地方！</p>
<p>由像形字進化到併音文字，是一種不可抵禦的傾向，注音符號雖「龜走」（黎錦熙先生語）了二十多年，不怕；國語羅馬字至今推行不廣，也不必氣餒，「時間」必定帮叻中國文字向這方面發展的。</p>
<p>七年前至十年前的「拉丁化新文字」運動，原則上和筆者小者學生時代爸爸敎給的簡式國語羅馬字並無大差別。不過一新文字運動」自開始即有人把持着作爲政治鬥爭工具之一，於是乎被當局誤會認爲害比「洪水猛獸」。假如當時那種簡便的併音文字不與另一股政治運動合流，祇要讓其自然發展下去，我想：到今天不會有人把「架床疊屋」而况爲是改革漢字一條路吧。</p>
<p>即使是「路」，怕也是「死路一條」！</p>
<p>週未茶話</p>
<p>— 劉隨</p>
<p>祝福明年</p>
<p>今天已屆本年最後一個週末。經歷了一年來五十二個週末，我們彷彿渡越了一條漫長而又多難的激流。在離開這些曾被我們踐踏過的歲月的殘頁之前，實在有太多的感想：國是未寗，民生如棘，「倒風」遍地，「漲風」方熾；接收淸查恰似一江春水，已付東流，配售物資要算雪中送炭了，但是也沒有給予我們以想望中的溫暖。住事如烟，這些零零碎碎的遺憾即將都成陳跡。聖經裏說：「醜惡的罪過的事情讓它逝去吧！光明就要繼之來臨的。」耶誕日我們默誦這一章，心頭有無窮的幻想。所謂「往者不諫來者可追」，其實往昔我毋諍諫已多，不過似乎都沒有因此而發生過若何顯著的效果。怨艾之餘，我們祇有衷心祈禱未來的新生，確確實實地塡補大家這一年來心底的空虛和缺憾！</p>
<p>「倒風」釋微</p>
<p>標會有「倒脚」，放款有「倒賬」，市面上紛紛鬧着「倒閉」，而政治上好像也醖驤着「倒什麽」，「倒什麽」的；一片倒聲，在臘鼓頻催的目前，神經衰弱一點的人關在不勝其「何以卒歲」之感。不過這也祇限于神經衰弱的患者纔有這種感覺，稍爲正常一點而兼具老謀深算者流。是可以視若無睹的。你看：儘營有「倒脚」「倒賬」的威脅，標會與高利貸正此起彼落，方興未艾；儘管馬路上一邊在哭喪着險「關店大拍賣」，「出淸存貨削碼賤售」，而一邊十萬元以上的聖誕大菜照樣先二日就定售一空，廿八萬元一只的聖誕蛋糕，也被人搶購回去做狂歡的點綴；儘管京滬各地許多神經衰弱的人在集會，通電要「倒什麼」，「倒什麼」，而被倒的地方似乎正大展新獻，充耳未聞；莊子云：「絢爛即平淡」，俗語說：「天下本無事，庸人自擾耳」，大槪唯庸人是世間最悲哀的角色！</p>
<p>禁宵舞</p>
<p>聖誕，新年，一週串的佳時令節，都市裏的人們當然要「聞聲起舞」，好像惟有「舞」纔能够表現出慶祝之忱。不過好事多磨：上海十二時以後要禁止宵舞，杭州祇准以交際舞會的形式聊事點綴，重慶和昆明等地聽說也似禁非禁；總之跳舞不比吸食雅片，爲了維持風化和治安「禁」是要偶爾禁一禁的，但「高尙娛樂」和「體恤商艱」的大原則總顧到。所以十二時以後新舞客不再放進，塲內的人仍舊可以婆娑達且；門口設置幾個望風的，裏面的交際舞會照樣可以　舞女伴舞。跳舞之禁如此，關係不大，但願明年一月起的大規模的烟毒之禁必須雷厲！</p>
<p>再會吧「狗年」</p>
<p>江陰的田賦徵實大舞弊，玉環的社會科長侵吞賬物，蘇州的名流索詐，接踵而來，形成了本年度最後的幾件不名譽的公案。時代的新屬交替已臨近眼前，而一年來貪污事件的高潮似乎並未就此吿一段落。平心而論，物價近年關照高，當然黃污要近歲尾而益精彩，所以我們實在不應有所厚誣於顯宦名流的。今年丙成肖犬，犬性雖忠，但急了就要跳龍，自不免發生許冬越乎矩範的配事；明年丁亥肖豕，豕雖鈍而能安分，能樂天知命，縱有　腹之愛，大槪還不致於像狗那樣時常　鑽出狗　來東偷偷，西摸摸的；年尾年頭，正屬交運脫運，明年豬運交到名流們身上、大家都將坐在家裏，從事於立德立言，不再拋頭露面，今年已無多日，舞弊食污事件臨別依依，難怪要表演一次最後的高潮了！</p>

Temporary Motions: Hu Shi proposed that as the Assembly had concluded successfully this time, Secretary-General Hong Lanyou, Deputy Secretary-General Lei Zhen, and all staff members of the Secretariat had worked diligently. Several representatives of the Presidium should jointly submit two points of opinion to the Secretariat of the Assembly in the coming days, requesting that a group photo of all representatives be taken and that a sacrifice be offered to the Founding Father when the Constitution is promulgated. It is learned that the Secretariat has forwarded the above opinions to the Presidium, which has decided to hold a ceremony to offer sacrifice to the Founding Father when the Constitution is promulgated on New Year's Day next year. The original text of the Secretariat's reply is as follows: "Respectfully, thank you for the two suggestions in your letter: (1) A group photo of all representatives of the Assembly should be taken as a permanent souvenir; (2) A sacrifice should be offered to the Founding Father upon the completion of the Constitution of the Republic of China. We immediately forwarded it to the Presidium for discussion. It was generally believed that newsreels have been made of all aspects of the Assembly, and photos have been taken separately according to provinces and units for preservation. They are all awaiting compilation into the National Assembly Record. Once published and distributed to the representatives, they can be kept as a permanent souvenir. Therefore, it seems unnecessary to take a group photo. As for the second point, the National Government has been requested to hold a ceremony to offer sacrifice to the Founding Father when the Constitution is promulgated on New Year's Day in 1947. It will be recorded in the annals. We respectfully report this to you for your consideration."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 27th] Mr. Foote, Chairman of the Sino-American Industrial Association, today submitted a "Comprehensive Abstract" to the U.S. State Department to exchange information on the upcoming spring trade agreement negotiations. Mr. Foote represents 400 companies in the association that are directly involved in trade with China. In his "Abstract," Mr. Foote requests revisions to China's commercial policies and tariff valuations, as he believes these policies hinder U.S. imports to China. He also requests tariff concessions on U.S. exports and asks the United States to lower tariff barriers on non-competitive Chinese goods.</p>
<p>Regarding tariffs, he requests that China adopt a reasonable and consistent policy for the valuation of imported goods. He points out that many U.S. exporters have expressed dissatisfaction because China's valuation of imported goods is based on black market prices rather than true wholesale market prices. This measure not only creates instability and confusion but also contributes to rising prices in China. Secondly, China must reform its procedures for announcing and administering commercial regulations. When China publishes new regulations, it does not adequately notify businesses and often fails to immediately inform relevant Chinese authorities, making it difficult for American companies to trade with China. China lacks various types of machinery and many raw materials, so the "Abstract" requests that China make tariff concessions on these imported goods. It also states that the recent advocacy by Chinese business circles for a strong tariff protection policy makes this point particularly important.</p>
<p>Due to the current large trade imbalance between China's imports and exports, the association suggests that the United States reduce tariffs on Chinese imports as much as possible. The reduction of tariffs on Chinese imports may be very limited. Before the war, one-half to two-thirds of China's imports were duty-free, including raw materials such as tung oil, silk, tin, and raw hides. As for dutiable goods, the average exceeded 55 percent of the total. According to the association, this specific reduction in import taxes can promote China's exports to the United States, thereby rectifying China's current abnormal trade imbalance, which is the reason why the Chinese government recently adopted an import approval system. These tariff concessions should especially apply to Chinese handicrafts such as carpets, lace, embroidery, hairnets, porcelain, bamboo products, straw braid, etc. In short, it can include all goods that do not compete with American products. This method was established before the war, but given China's current high costs, U.S. import authorities are taxing these items and several times higher than before the war, thus impacting this trade.</p>
<p>The "Abstract" further points out that sound bilateral trade depends on reducing tariffs on these items. Before China's foreign exchange stabilization takes effect and the excessively high legal tender (currency) price is equivalent to actual purchasing power, there are few remedies for China's import industry. Therefore, the association suggests that while the United States takes tariff concessions, the Chinese government should simultaneously take parallel steps to effectively stabilize the currency.</p>
<h3 id="e26">U.S. Military to Withdraw from Oil Business in China and the Philippines <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th] The U.S. Inter-Navy Petroleum Bureau announced today that the U.S. military will withdraw from its commercial oil operations in China on December 31st and from its operations in the Philippines on January 31st of next year. According to the announcement, the U.S. government is withdrawing from the oil business because private companies are now able to transport and establish oil storage facilities on their own. This work was initially notified as impossible at the beginning of the war. Since the victory over Japan, the U.S. military has been able to sell more than 5.5 million barrels of various types of oil to China and the Philippines. This plan was supported by the U.S. industry because it could help Americans rebuild their interests in the areas devastated by the Japanese military.</p>

<h3 id="e27">UNRRA Relief Supplies to China Not Yet Half Delivered; Truman Submits Report to Congress <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 26th] President Truman recently submitted the ninth UNRRA progress report for the third quarter of 1946 to Congress, and also pointed out the relief needs after the end of UNRRA in 1947. The President's letter stated, "The relief materials of UNRRA in 1947 may reach as much as 750 million US dollars, so many liberated areas probably do not need further relief." The President expressed complete agreement with the State Department's recommendations for handling relief matters in 1947. He said: "The State Department's recommendation is that the urgent relief issues in 1947 should be directly negotiated by the governments of the supplying countries and the recipient countries, and the Secretariat of the United Nations should be used as a center for the exchange of information among the governments of the member states. I completely agree with this approach to handling the relief issues in 1947." He said that the United Nations is actively discussing the relief issues after the end of UNRRA, as well as the important issue of caring for refugees. He continued, "When I submit the next report to Congress, I may provide a clearer picture, reporting on the UNRRA cleanup plan and the supply situation after the end of UNRRA in 1947." As of the third quarter of this year, UNRRA has shipped nearly 16,723,342 metric tons of goods, worth approximately $2,045,035,000. The relief plan for China, including materials worth over 227 million US dollars in September, has been completed about 42 percent. In terms of value, the materials shipped by UNRRA in that quarter were greatest to Poland, Italy, and China.</p>
<h3 id="e28">State Department Considers Forced Departure of U.S. Warship from Dalian Resolved; Soviet Warning Had No Ultimatum Meaning <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 26th] The U.S. State Department has largely considered the incident of a U.S. warship being expelled from the port of Dalian by the Soviet military authorities to be resolved. Mr. White, director of the State Department's press release office, announced today that the U.S. warship was allowed to stay in Dalian for 48 hours and received a warning to withdraw when the period expired. This warning was issued by the Soviet port management authorities, not by the Soviet military commander. I believe that this warning did not have the meaning of an ultimatum. The Soviet authorities even allowed a two-hour extension after the 48-hour deadline expired, which is reasonable in every way.</p>
<p>White House Announces Details</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 26th] U.S. officials have further investigated the so-called forced withdrawal of a U.S. warship from Dalian and found that the facts are quite different from what was rumored. In particular, the claim that the Soviet side ordered the U.S. warship to withdraw within 20 minutes is not true. After a U.S. communication ship entered Dalian, the Soviet official in charge allowed it to extend its stay for two hours beyond the prescribed time. Twenty minutes before the extended time was up, the Soviet official notified the U.S. side that the time was up and that he would not be responsible if any further stay caused problems. U.S. officials believe that the Soviet official's granting of extra time for the U.S. warship to stay was a great show of cooperation. He later discovered that his granting of extra time had not been approved by his superiors, which may have caused him to panic and force him to ask the U.S. warship to leave. As one U.S. official said, the incident contained absolutely no coercion or unfriendliness. As for the three Americans on board the ship, they were not allowed to disembark because they had not obtained prior Soviet permission, and the Sino-Soviet treaty stipulating Dalian as a free port has not yet been implemented.</p>
<p>U.S. Newspapers Publish Critical Editorials</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 26th] Scripps-Howard newspapers published an editorial stating that the U.S. State Department's lenient handling of the Dalian incident, acknowledging the Soviet authorities' right to lower the curtain in the city, distorts the overall situation there. The editorial stated, "The only reason the Soviet army controls Dalian is that the Chinese government cannot persuade the Soviet Union to return the city to China." The newspaper accused the State Department's Far East Division (headed by Mr. Vincent) of adopting a policy toward the Soviet Union that "tried to undermine MacArthur's position in Japan and distrusted the Chinese government led by Chairman Chiang because he refused to make concessions to the Chinese Communists." The editorial concluded, "Until the State Department eradicates this red 'cell,' the United States will continue to lose its prestige and legitimate rights."</p>

<p>Chinese Ambassador Lee Submits Note Requesting Three Points; No Reply Received Yet</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 24th] (Delayed) Our embassy in Siam recently sent a note to the Siamese Foreign Ministry, based on the opinions of overseas Chinese teachers in Siam, requesting (1) to increase the number of class hours for Chinese language courses in overseas Chinese primary schools to the level before the war; (2) to exempt overseas Chinese teachers who do not teach Siamese from Siamese language examinations; (3) considering the translation of Chinese textbooks into Siamese unnecessary. It is reported that as of the time of this telegram, the Siamese authorities have not yet provided a reply. Last week, the Siamese education authorities suddenly issued orders to the following two largest overseas Chinese schools here, requiring them to register with the Siamese Ministry of Education within fifteen days: Huang Hun Middle School (run by the Chaozhou Fellow Villagers Association) and Jinmin Primary School (run by the Hakka Fellow Villagers Association). People in the overseas Chinese education community here have expressed indignation at this action by the Siamese government, believing that this order from the Siamese government is a trial balloon to test the strength of our embassy. A few days ago, overseas Chinese teachers held a meeting and unanimously decided to oppose registration until the education regulations promulgated during the Pibul government era are revised. They also resolved to pledge their support to the embassy's note and, if the points raised are all rejected, to prepare to close the schools. These issues seriously affect Sino-Siamese relations. Ambassador Lee is doing his best to handle the current case and has gained the unanimous support of the local overseas Chinese.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 27th] The Wang Shuixiang kicked-to-death case was concluded by the Hong Kong High Court a few days ago, but the jury could not reach a verdict due to differing opinions. A retrial was held at 10:00 a.m. on the 27th. The prosecutor stated in court that the police officer, Lin Xingse, was charged with manslaughter, but the charges were dropped due to insufficient evidence. However, the European part of the case will be brought up again once conclusive evidence is collected. After hearing this, the judge expressed his agreement and announced the unconditional release of the defendant. This sensational criminal case, which attracted national attention, ended with an acquittal due to a lack of evidence in the eyes of the law.</p>

<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 26th] Regarding the case on September 23 in Shanghai in which a U.S. Army jeep collided with the car of two Soviet citizens, and it was alleged that the U.S. military police beat the two Soviet citizens, the U.S. government, after thorough investigation, rejected the Soviet protest. A State Department spokesman said today: "The U.S. authorities conducting the investigation believe that the U.S. military police did not violate disciplinary conduct. Since the Soviet citizen in this case was responsible for the accident, there is no reason to demand medical compensation." The spokesman continued: "The Soviet authorities have been notified of this matter." He added: "The Soviet citizen in this case may follow the established procedures of the U.S. Army to claim compensation for the damage to his car."</p>
<h3 id="e34">Discrimination Against Overseas Chinese in the Philippines Intensifies; Filipinization of Markets Cuts Off Livelihoods of Overseas Chinese Vendors; Free Press Publishes Strongly Worded Criticism <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 27th] Mr. Lin, chairman of the Overseas Chinese Market Vendors Association, stated today that the new regulations for managing market vendors in the Philippines, scheduled to be implemented on January 1, will cut off the only livelihood of overseas Chinese vendors. The new regulations have an extremely nationalistic meaning, which is contrary to the position expressed by the Roxas government on this matter. Mr. Lin also appealed to give overseas Chinese vendors five to ten years to switch to other industries.</p>
<p>[Another Cable] Mr. Laxon, a famous columnist for the Philippine Free Press, wrote an article today, harshly criticizing Filipinos for discriminating against overseas Chinese. It is said: "Some Filipinos were outraged and indignant when white brothers began to drive them with the well-known Yankee style, but now they turn around and apply it to the overseas Chinese. Since we insist on being treated equally by white people, we should also treat other ethnic groups the same way to be fair. Even if the overseas Chinese are not superior to us, they do not regard us as inferior."</p>
<p>[Another Cable] Last week, 500 Chinese arrived in the Philippines from Xiamen without proper entry permits. Mr. Faber, the Philippine Colonial Commissioner, ordered 100 of them to be deported today. The remaining 400 were allowed to stay because they had business relations in the Philippines, or had property or relatives residing here. Another thirteen overseas Chinese were accused by the Philippine Rehabilitation and Relief Administration of privately selling stored sugar (all stored sugar in the Philippines is requisitioned by the government). If approved by Philippine President Roxas, they will also be ordered to be deported.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 27th] Farmers in the New Territories of Kowloon are conducting a passive resistance against the Hong Kong government's control of the vegetable market. Some vegetable farmers have stopped planting and are looking for other ways out, while others have switched to planting miscellaneous grains. The vegetable fields in the New Territories have now become barren land. The Kowloon General Chamber of Commerce believes that vegetables are daily necessities for citizens, and once there is no vegetable production locally, relying solely on foreign imports will have a significant impact. Therefore, they are appealing on behalf of the farmers and requesting the abolition of control.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 27th] Fishermen are deeply dissatisfied with the Hong Kong authorities' control of the fish market and the extraction of profits. The Hong Kong Fishermen's Association recently studied the possibility of opening a new fishing area on Lingding Island, far away from Hong Kong, to avoid Hong Kong's control and develop fishing in South China. They are currently drafting a plan to borrow 300,000 Hong Kong dollars from the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to build fishing village houses on the island and build a huge dam to protect against wind and waves, so as to dock large and small fishing boats. After the new fishing area is completed, Hong Kong's fishing industry may concentrate there.</p>

It is reported that the Huayuankou Blocking Project will be completed next month, but the restoration of the dikes in the old course of the Yellow River and the relocation of people in the old course area have not been completed. Therefore, the Communist Party will send personnel to negotiate with UNRRA for the funds for restoring the dikes and the subsidies for the relocation of people. Huang Hua, director of the Communist Party Executive Department's press office, said that Ye Jianying had talked with Stuart Leiden about the Yellow River blocking problem yesterday, but no new agreement was reached.</p>

<p>Shenyang Celebrated Greatly Yesterday</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 27th] Shenyang's first anniversary of takeover was celebrated greatly today on the 27th. Shenyang is now the heart of the Northeast. Mayor Dong Wenqi took over the municipal administration under dangerous conditions. The personnel of the puppet municipal government cooperated with him to overcome the difficulties. Therefore, except for the responsible departments, more than 90% of the original personnel are still employed. Mr. Huang said that he had done his best to be friendly to the Soviet army at that time. The Soviet army demanded recognition of its acquisition of property rights, but he finally managed to avoid signing. The current situation after a year is not simple. He is still maintaining the scale of an ordinary city. In his capacity as a representative of the citizens, he hopes to be changed to a municipality directly under the Executive Yuan as soon as possible to seek future development. The Shenyang Revitalization Three-Year Plan will be implemented starting next year.</p>

Those in the industry who had deposited remittances in the above four banks yesterday and the day before held meetings this morning to discuss the methods of withdrawing the remittances. Because the four banks are all trying to preserve the situation in Chongqing, they mostly asked their counterparts for accommodation with monthly promissory notes. The general trend of depositing money suddenly became prevalent again, which is another undercurrent after the insane rise in gold prices. Even short-term lending among peers is mutually suspicious, so the money market has become extremely tight again. According to people familiar with the banking industry, in the short term, several more banks may continue to stop exchanging due to poor turnover.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Convening of the Frontier Education Conference — And Congratulations on the Establishment of the International Cultural Cooperation Association <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The historically significant National Assembly has just concluded, and we see two more historically significant gatherings convened in Nanjing: one is the Frontier Education Conference convened by the Ministry of Education, and the other is the inaugural meeting of the International Cultural Cooperation Association convened on the 26th. Although these two gatherings differ in nature and significance, they are both related to cultural and educational matters and therefore share common ground. After the fundamental national blueprint longed for by the people has been completed, the convening of these cultural and educational conferences is indeed very gratifying. Why do we say this? As the National Assembly concluded, we commented on "the completion of the constitutional undertaking," believing that when it comes to the Constitution, "the Constitution itself is not just a set of articles, but a living, vital creation. The drafting of the Constitution can only be said to be its birth, like a newborn infant, it must still develop and grow," and we hope that the people of the country will cherish our Constitution, so that it can grow to adulthood. For the people to cherish our Constitution, it is largely a matter of education. We must raise the educational level of the people, and then the people will be able to cherish this national law that has emerged from hardship. The holding of these cultural and educational conferences following the National Assembly is gratifying, because the result of frontier education will inevitably be to increase the love of our frontier compatriots for the Constitution; and the establishment of the International Cultural Cooperation Association undoubtedly aims to promote international understanding in the cultural field; thus, our fundamental law will inevitably be able to gain general recognition and understanding internationally through the medium of the International Cultural Cooperation Association. All of this is related to the birth of the Constitution; therefore, the convening of these cultural and educational conferences after the National Assembly is indeed a gratifying thing.</p>
<p>Speaking of continuous education, the problems here are not simple. First, frontier education is a rather broad term. Our country's frontier is vast, and the compatriots residing in the frontier are very complex in terms of language, culture, and even blood. The Mongols, Tibetans, Xinjiang people, and the various Yi ethnic groups residing in the southwest are not the same in language, culture, and even blood; they all have their own unique problems. The problems that appear in Xinjiang are not necessarily the same as those in Tibet. However, they are all our frontier compatriots; because they are all frontiers, we must not adhere to our central government's policy on frontier administration in dealing with the issue of frontier education. The Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee had important resolutions on frontier policy, which began by stating: "It is found that our Mongol, Tibetan, and Hui compatriots are all members of our great Chinese nation, and the regions where they are distributed are an indivisible part of our territory. Our party has always aimed to assist and develop all frontier compatriots, joining hands to move forward, hoping that they will all share in prosperity and happiness. ... Now that the war has been won, the responsibility of building the country should be borne jointly by all our compatriots." The resolutions passed in this meeting either involved the need for clear provisions in the Constitution to guarantee the autonomous rights of frontier ethnic groups, or involved the opportunity for frontier compatriots to participate in the government, among which those related to culture and education were: "The teaching in all levels of education in the areas where frontier ethnic groups reside should cultivate the language of the ethnic group, and Mandarin should be a compulsory subject, to be implemented at the discretion of the Ministry of Education. The official documents of all levels of government should be used in both Mandarin and the language of the ethnic group as a principle."</p>
<p>Our newspaper has previously published articles on this frontier policy, believing that: "The resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee, in expanding the inherent cultural life of the frontier compatriots, not only shows the central government's concern for the frontier compatriots, but also opens up a broad avenue for their future development. ... Therefore, in this resolution, our country's ethnic policy is becoming increasingly clear, ... the negative significance of this policy is that we have abandoned the assimilation policy with aggressive implications, and in the positive aspect, our ethnic policy is to support the self-development of frontier compatriots, and especially to pay attention to the development of their inherent culture. The Constitution passed by the National Assembly, in its Article 169, clearly stipulates: "The State shall actively promote the education, culture, transportation, water conservancy, sanitation, and other economic and social undertakings of the various ethnic groups in the frontier regions, and assist their development. With regard to land use, it shall provide guarantees and development in accordance with the climate, soil properties, and the customs of the people." It is also now enshrined in the constitution to support the development of the inherent culture of our compatriots in the frontier regions. Then, the focus of so-called frontier education should also be on supporting the development of the inherent cultural life of the local people, and then raising their educational level. Our neighboring country, the Soviet Union, has adopted such a policy; our country's frontier is also adjacent to the Soviet Union; we should especially understand the national policy and strive to promote frontier education.</p>
<p>What we should also congratulate here is the establishment of the International Cultural Cooperation Association. Our chairman specially issued an instruction to encourage the establishment of the association. The establishment of the International Cultural Cooperation Association aims to promote the cultural relations between our country and the international community, in order to increase the understanding between our country and the international community. It is found that the relations between countries are multifaceted, but cultural relations are the most fundamental. Therefore, in recent times, all countries have had institutions dedicated to promoting international cultural cooperation. Even in our country, we see the British Council, the United States Information Service, and cultural activities from the Soviet side. Our country, as an ancient cultural country, is unique in not having such an institution dedicated to this task, which is ultimately regrettable. Now that the International Cultural Cooperation Association has been established in Nanjing, it will certainly carry forward the chairman's encouragement, promote our traditional culture, and increase the spirit of friendship among ethnic groups; then, the achievements of the International Cultural Cooperation Association in the future will certainly shine as brightly as the British Council. As it is established, we hereby express our sincere congratulations.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Unprecedented Air Transport Tragedy <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The tragedy of the three civilian aircraft accidents in Shanghai on Christmas Day occurred on the same day, with only a few hours in between, resulting in more than 80 casualties. This is truly a tragedy in the history of civil aviation. After three days, we have turned from a state of shock and mourning and begun to think. We are naturally very surprised that this series of tragedies occurred at the same time and in the same place. We naturally express our infinite condolences and regret for the deceased. Due to the occurrence of this series of tragedies, people are naturally thinking about the issue of responsibility. Regarding this issue of responsibility, it is quite difficult for unqualified personnel in the aviation industry to make a judgment. Now that the government's competent authorities have come to Shanghai for a thorough investigation, it is believed that in the near future, the responsibility will be determined; we do not need to discuss it here. However, although we outsiders do not need to talk too much about the issue of responsibility and technical issues of aircraft accidents, the fact that three aircraft crashed on the frontier in one day has forced us to consider several points.</p>
<p>First, the severe weather in Shanghai on the day of the accident was well known. According to reports, several aircraft received telegrams about the severe weather in Shanghai and suspended their flights to Shanghai. What we want to consider now is whether the three aircraft that crashed had received telegrams about the severe weather in Shanghai suspending their flights to Shanghai. If they had not received them, why did Shanghai not report it by telegram; if the telegrams were sent but not received, then there must be a problem with the radio equipment in the aircraft; flying passengers directly without inspecting and repairing the radio equipment in the aircraft that has problems; if there is no problem with the radio equipment, then it is inevitably a matter of the discipline of the flight personnel. Everyone is concerned about this civil aviation tragedy and wants to understand something about these.</p>
<p>Second, the flight equipment seems to be a bit problematic. If the airport had blind landing equipment, perhaps such a tragedy would not have occurred; if the aircraft also had parachute equipment, then it seems that there would not have been so many casualties. Regarding these, it seems difficult to absolve the airline of the responsibility of negligence. As for the fog, it itself did not directly cause this tragedy. Chongqing is a famous fog city, and in Chongqing, in the difficult environment during the war, we have not heard of such a tragedy as this.</p>
<p>The dead cannot be resurrected. Due to this civil aviation tragedy, we hope that the government and airlines can equally raise their awareness of flight safety. If the airport's equipment is incomplete, it should be supplemented; if the civil aviation airport in Longhua is insufficient, it should be added. Now that the aviation agreements between China and the United States and between China and France have been signed, and international civil aviation will soon be flying through Shanghai; we must pay special attention to the efficiency of the Shanghai airport. Due to this painful experience, we hope that civil aviation will be safer in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Jiangsu and Zhejiang Expedite Collection of Land Tax in Kind — Central Government Strictly Orders Completion of Task as Scheduled <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Hangzhou by this newspaper] The Central Government originally stipulated that the work of collecting land tax in kind for this year should be fully collected by the end of this year. Zhejiang Province started collecting later, and currently the collection in various counties is only about 30%. Therefore, the Provincial Food Bureau has decided to extend the deadline to the end of January to collect the full amount, but this decision has not been approved by the Central Government. Yesterday, the Central Government sent a strict telegram to the province urging the collection, and ordered that if the collection officials in the counties that fail to complete the collection work as scheduled should be penalized.</p>
<p>[Report from Zhenjiang by this newspaper] This year, various provinces and cities continue to implement the land tax in kind, and the Executive Yuan attaches great importance to this. It has issued a general order to all provinces to start collecting uniformly from September 15th, and to collect the full amount within three months. It has successively telegraphed and ordered various provinces and ordered various counties and cities to comply. Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Government received a telegram from the Executive Yuan, ordering all counties and cities to collect the full amount as scheduled, without any shortage of grains. It instructed the Provincial Government to appoint the director of the department or provincial committee members to conduct zonal inspections and urging, and limited the time for the establishment of land collection supervision committees in various counties and cities to perform their duties of correction and to achieve the effect of eliminating malpractices and benefiting the people. It should also report the handling situation to the Ministry of Food at any time. After receiving the order, the Provincial Government has appointed the director of the Construction Department to go to the 2nd and 4th districts for zonal inspections and urging immediately.</p>

<p>[Report from Wujin by this newspaper] The third congress of the county council of the county of Wujin, in order to maintain the integrity of the council and strictly eliminate traitors, in order to soothe the grievances of the people, the congress decided unanimously to continue to indict traitors (according to the indictment of Tang Zhuoran and others made by the council at the last congress), and the congress passed the indictment of 39 traitors, the list of which is as follows: Xu Pucheng (puppet military officer), Tang Yinghan (puppet judicial traitor), Sun Shichao (puppet county magistrate), Xu Guanqun, Jiang Jingcheng (economic traitor), Zhu Mouan (puppet central military academy instructor), Xie Aosheng, Tang Yuren, Liu Shun, Chen Xuefu, Qian Rusong, Zhou Bingkun, Ma Xianghai (all of the above are enemy and puppet secret agents), Ma Baosheng, Wu Caiyuan, Li Qingda, Lu Jinsheng, Lv Deqing, Li Ruiying (all of the above are enemy and puppet translators), Zhen Kunsheng (secret agent), Lu Juyuan (puppet Wan Chu county magistrate), Xie Zhijing (puppet legislator), Gao Guanren (interpreter), Wang Guoliang (i.e., A Qi enemy agent), Miao Sanda, Zhang Yongnian, Cao Hongxi, Pang Liangchen, Li Jinsheng, Zhuang Linda, Ren Qilin (all of the above served as enemy agents), Fu Yinbao, Shen Changshan, Zhao Hongxian (all of the above are puppet special agents), Ding Jianqian (special agent station chief), Tan Daozhi (special agent), Zhong Yuanhui, Liu Xuru (puppet district chief), Bai Xifan (puppet tax collection), totaling 39 people.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Zhejiang Province Plans to Enclose Coastal Mudflats <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Hangzhou on the 27th by this newspaper] In order to increase agricultural production in Zhejiang Province, it is determined to enclose coastal mudflats. In late last month, the provincial committee member Gong Peicheng, together with the Zhejiang Reclamation Company of the General Agricultural and Feng Bureau and other relevant agencies, formed an inspection team to inspect the fisheries and salt industry. Chairman Shen took Sanmen County as the reclamation center, and the team took Popagang, Jiantiaogang, Jiankangtang, Haili, , Panteng, Nantian, and Longquantang as the reclamation bases. It was decided that 30,000 mu of land in Nantian and Longquan could be used to set up a demonstration cooperative farm, with mechanical reclamation. As for the saying that there are 100,000 mu of land in the Huangmen reclamation area, it should actually be changed to the Huangmen Reservoir for irrigation. The large-scale reclamation of mudflats in Sanmen Bay is not economical. It is advisable to restore the old ponds first and engage in aquaculture. The only large-scale area that can be reclaimed is Popagang, and the time for desalination is not long. There are 8,000 mu of land in the Pufeng area. As for the plan to block the Xuanmen Port to create 4,000 mu of land, it is not appropriate, because water transportation and 3,000 salt farmers in Chumen will be affected, and the Shan Port will also cause floods. Gong told reporters that the reclamation of coastal mudflats to improve the lives of coastal fishermen is not only an important economic task in Zhejiang Province, but also concerns national defense and national reputation, so it is hoped that it will be carried out as soon as possible. The winter fishing season has arrived, and due to the impact of the war, 5,000 to 6,000 fishing boats from Fujian fishermen who have not come to the Zhoushan Islands and other places to fish in the past eight years have appeared in the Zhejiang Sea. Their skills are better than those of the Zhejiang people, and the harvest can be abundant. However, there is no fish and salt, so the Salt Bureau quickly abandoned the distribution of thousands of dans to help production. As for the fishery protection team, it has been established in Songmen, Shitang, Chumen, and other places.</p>

Other relief materials were also mostly distributed to northeastern Anhui. Many councilors from central and southern Anhui questioned why there was no relief when there were also disasters in central and southern Anhui. Councilors from northeastern Anhui also asked how the relief materials in the past were distributed in northeastern Anhui, and some specifically pointed out that disaster relief is like fighting a fire, and hoped to pay attention to the timeliness. Director Ye answered each item one by one.</p>

<p>[Report from our Zhenjiang Office, 27th] Zhenjiang rice merchants, anticipating the Spring Festival and compounded by continuous rains throughout the year, once raised rice prices to 62,000 yuan.

<p>[Report from our Suzhou Office, 27th] Regarding the brawl involving the Suzhou garrison, the county provisional council originally scheduled a meeting on the morning of the 27th to convene all parties to discuss post-incident mediation. However, the meeting was adjourned due to the absence of representatives from the wounded soldiers. Another meeting was held at 6 PM, with the county government, provisional council, and Chamber of Commerce inviting local party, government, and French consular officials to a dinner gathering at the New Asia Restaurant for further discussions.

The Chamber of Commerce's small quota is due to underreporting 2,000 members. Recently, the election was postponed due to the unresolved dispute over the quota of councilors for industry, commerce, and agriculture. Currently, the county provisional council, county party headquarters, and county government have negotiated and persuaded the labor union to cede two councilor seats and the farmers' association to cede one, transferring them to the Chamber of Commerce's quota. This situation was telegraphed to the provincial government for approval yesterday. Once 　 approval is received, the election will be held.</p>

<p>[Report from our Zhenjiang Office] Since the Zhenjiang Garrison Command of the Southern Jiangsu Military Region began handling conscription in its subordinate counties, the quota of soldiers from each county has been successively completed and sent to centralized locations in batches for intensified training. However, the command has recently received numerous reports of irregularities and bribery by township and village chiefs during the procedures for drafting and conscripting able-bodied men, which seriously affects the national conscription system. If such heinous acts are not punished, the foundation of conscription cannot be sound. The command has now secretly dispatched officers to investigate thoroughly.

<p>[Report from our Changshu Office] Here, on Christmas morning, a thick fog prevailed, followed by drizzle after 10 AM, which continued until nightfall. The atmospheric pressure was low. Unexpectedly, starting at 6:30 PM, startled birds (wild ducks) began falling from the sky in succession, in great numbers. The first to notice were staff at the Xin Zhuangyuan Restaurant in the northern part of the city, who collected fifteen ducks in a short time. The incident caused a sensation far and wide, with people scrambling to find them. After 8 PM, even more fell, numbering in the thousands. Some were alive and some were dead when they landed, causing a city-wide commotion and becoming a strange tale. The male birds had emerald green feathers on both sides of their heads and their entire bodies were brilliantly colored, weighing about a pound. The females were smaller, slightly dark gray. The reason for the fall varies according to different people's opinions, and a comedy of "catching wild ducks" unfolded in every corner of the city. Because residents could cook them for meals, they formed groups, holding electric torches and searching widely in the rain. They were particularly numerous in the downtown area of Shimei, Old County Field, and the Altar. The Greater China Hotel alone obtained more than twenty ducks. Numerous ducks also fell on the rooftops of newspaper offices. Until after midnight, there were still sporadic falls and searches. In the area in front of the temple, some even claimed it was a Christmas gift from Santa Claus, while others said that a beauty like Xi Shi was about to be born in the town, hence the phenomenon of falling wild geese.</p>

<p>When Will Agricultural Machinery Be Distributed?</p>
<p>It has been found that the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) plans to distribute agricultural machinery. After the victory, the cooperatives in our county successively submitted requests for distribution to the Su-Ning Branch. However, the responses they received were all along the lines of “unified allocation.” To date, no cooperative has been allocated these machines. Newspapers frequently report on agricultural machinery arriving and plans to revitalize agriculture. Why has no distribution been seen yet? Several cooperatives received official documents regarding this so-called unified allocation at the time, and joyfully convened member meetings to make reports. The farmers believed it to be true, and they all waited for foreign agricultural machinery to work for our rural areas.

<p>Two Responses Regarding Student Matters</p>
<p>1. Reply to Mr. Zhou Guoliang (1) Most universities allow students holding distribution certificates from the Ministry of Education to register, but there are exceptions, such as National Wuhan University, which requires students holding distribution certificates from the Ministry of Education to have a diploma from an experimental high school. Also, students who have not graduated from high school should declare to the university authorities when registering that they were admitted to the university with equivalent educational qualifications. (2) A distribution certificate from the Ministry of Education cannot be regarded as an academic qualification certificate; it only proves that the student holding the distribution certificate is qualified for admission.</p>
<p>2. Reply to Mr. Gu Fan (1) The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education has approved the registration of the private Hongyi Middle School, and the Bureau is now submitting it to the Ministry of Education for verification. Once the registration is approved, the graduation diplomas submitted by the school will be stamped and returned by the Bureau. (2) Since you are missing a semester of schooling and falsely reported a semester of schooling, if discovered by the authorities, it will naturally become a major problem, and there is no remedy.</p>

<p>I. Note from US Ambassador to China Leighton Stuart to Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Shih-chieh</p>
<p>With reference to the air transport agreement concluded this day between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of China, my Government understands that the following points have been agreed upon in addition:</p>
<p>(A) Pending the enlargement and improvement of the facilities of the Tientsin airport to an extent adequate to accommodate aircraft operating on the international routes specified in the above-mentioned Agreement which designate Tientsin as a point on the air route, the Chinese Government will permit aircraft operating on this route to make use of the Peiping airport for international air transport purposes.</p>
<p>(B) Any United States air carrier designated to operate on route (2) and (3) included in paragraph (A) of the Annex may, at the option of the United States Government, serve Hong Kong instead of Canton; provided, however, that the designated United States air carrier may not operate local air services between Hong Kong and any one of the points in Chinese territory mentioned in the Annex to the Agreement. Should the United States Government elect to designate Canton instead of Hong Kong, the United States air carrier designated to operate on route (2) included in paragraph (A) of the Annex shall have the right to connect at Canton with its trans-Pacific route. Chinese air carriers designated to operate on routes (1) and (2) included in paragraph (B) of the Annex shall also have the right to connect at San Francisco.</p>
<p>(C) The United States Government would like to have United States air carriers granted rights to operate to and from other points within China on international air routes in addition to those provided for in the Agreement. The Chinese Government does not at present contemplate the addition of any such points but is prepared to give the matter prompt consideration when the situation is appropriate.</p>
<p>(D) As soon as air carriers of any third country are granted rights to operate to and from additional points within China, United States air carriers shall be accorded the same rights. On a reciprocal basis, Chinese air carriers shall likewise be granted rights to operate to and from additional points within the United States.</p>
<p>(E) The phrase "and beyond" as used in the Annex to the Agreement means that the designated routes may be extended beyond the boundary of the territory of the Contracting Party in question to a point or points in another country or countries. The use of this phrase should not be interpreted as requiring that either Contracting Party must authorize additional points within its territory.</p>
<p>(F) The United States Government agrees that if at any time the United States enters into an agreement with any other country adopting the method of pre-determination of frequencies or capacity, it will enter into a similar agreement with the Chinese Government.</p>
<p>I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the expression of my highest consideration.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>To His Excellency Dr. Wang Shih-chieh Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China</p>

<h3 id="e65">Vietnamese Nationalist Party Leader Expresses Determination to Fight for Independence to the End, Willing to Reconcile with Ho Chi Minh and Organize a Coalition Government, to Negotiate Favorable Agreements with France <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 26th] A senior member of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party recently told our reporter that the Vietnamese Nationalist Party is prepared to reconcile with the government led by President Ho Chi Minh and fight France to the end for their common cause. The Vietnamese Nationalist Party has begun negotiations with the coalition government to establish a united front. The previous war in the Lao Cai region has stopped. If it is necessary for the interests of Vietnam, the Vietnamese Nationalist Party 　 will form a coalition government with President Ho Chi Minh to negotiate favorable agreements with France. Regarding the relationship between Vietnam and France, the Vietnamese people are eager to stop the bloodshed and establish an agreement with France. If France is willing to grant Vietnam the status of an autonomous region and then grant it independence within the French Union, this agreement can be concluded. If France can agree in principle to Vietnam sending diplomatic representatives abroad, the Vietnamese Nationalist Party will also be satisfied and will only request the right to send consuls to Vietnam's neighboring countries in the shortest possible time. Regarding the referendum in Cochinchina, if the mixed committee of France, Vietnam, and Cochinchina can guarantee a free vote, the Vietnamese Nationalist Party will accept the result of the vote. However, there is a minority ethnic group in the central highlands of Cochinchina with backward education and culture, making it impossible to hold a referendum, which is a thorny issue. Conversely, the Vietnamese Nationalist Party cannot accept any solution that prevents Vietnam from retaining the southern highlands of central Vietnam, but this issue is not unsolvable. The Vietnamese Nationalist Party is eager to revise the Franco-Vietnamese agreement signed on March 6 of this year, especially regarding the issue of ethnic minorities, but the Vietnamese Nationalist Party is prepared to accept the establishment of a customs union between France and Vietnam. In short, Vietnam is prepared to guarantee France's economic and cultural interests and is willing to cooperate faithfully with France to develop Vietnam. It is reported that the leader of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party is former Foreign Minister Nguyen Tuong Tam, who is now in Nanjing, advocating the establishment of a "National Front Government" and may be appointed Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Viet Minh Forces Launch Fierce Counteroffensive in Hanoi Suburbs; Moutet Refuses to Cede Territory to Viet Minh <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>[United Press International, Saigon, 27th] French military authorities here announced that French forces had repelled fierce counterattacks by Viet Minh troops in several areas of northern Vietnam. A communiqué stated that Viet Minh forces were unusually active in Hanoi, launching counterattacks at several locations, but were repelled with losses on both sides. It was reported that eight Japanese were among the Viet Minh troops killed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 26th] Viet Minh Radio claimed that the Viet Minh Republic government moved out of Hanoi last week to Ha Dong, 13 kilometers southwest of Hanoi. A French military communiqué stated that fierce fighting took place on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day in Nam Dinh, 80 miles southeast of Hanoi. French forces held their positions and inflicted heavy casualties on Viet Minh forces. The Gia Lam airfield outside Hanoi was also attacked by Viet Minh forces, but all attacks were repelled by French forces. Viet Minh forces have also disappeared from the 32-kilometer supply route between Hanoi and Ba Ninh. Many Viet Minh strongholds in Haiphong have been captured by French forces. Recent dispatches from Saigon stated that French forces in Hanoi encountered fierce resistance from Viet Minh forces in their mopping-up operations.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 27th] French Colonial Minister Moutet declared here today that any attempt to cede even a small portion of southern or central Vietnam to the Viet Minh Republic without consulting the local people should be rejected.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 27th] Various Vietnamese groups today jointly petitioned Moutet, calling for peace, stating that an immediate cessation of conflict is the only way to prevent the destruction of Vietnam and protect French interests.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 26th] A dispatch from Saigon stated that after arriving in Saigon, French Colonial Minister Moutet met with French High Commissioner d'Argenlieu, French military commander in Vietnam Valluy, and his Chief of Staff, Lecocq. He also met with Major Bellanger, who had just arrived in Saigon from the Hanoi war zone, and thus gained a full picture of the situation in Vietnam. After Moutet arrived in Saigon, he was welcomed by Le Van Hoach, President of the Provisional Government of Cochinchina, who, along with his staff, reported on the activities of Viet Minh elements in southern Vietnam. Moutet told reporters that his stay in Vietnam would be very short, and he hoped to return home to report to the government by January 16th.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Nanking, 27th] Sources at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here stated that negotiations between China and France regarding the establishment of neutral zones for overseas Chinese in Hanoi and Haiphong are progressing satisfactorily, and the French authorities in Hanoi have paid close attention to protecting overseas Chinese in the area. The Ministry has not received detailed reports regarding the safety of overseas Chinese in Nam Dinh, where French defense forces are in a precarious situation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also denied reports in the "Ta Kung Pao" that negotiations between China and France regarding the transfer of the Yunnan section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to China had stalled due to significant differences of opinion, stating that negotiations are proceeding smoothly and the two sides are gradually nearing agreement.</p>

<p>[United Press, Saigon, 27th] A secret radio station of the Vietnamese People's Republic broadcast a message on Christmas Day, blaming the French for the outbreak of war in Hanoi. The message stated that the French presented an ultimatum on December 19th, demanding that the Vietnamese People's Republic transfer power to the French, thus initiating the war.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 26th] French Foreign Ministry officials believe that the war in Vietnam was a premeditated action by the Viet Minh. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the Viet Minh attack on December 19th was a premeditated act of aggression. Before launching the aggression, the Viet Minh government deliberately created a more relaxed relationship between France and Vietnam to lower the guard of the French authorities.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] The Vietnam situation continues to be a topic of debate in Parisian newspaper editorials. Left-wing newspapers denounced the use of force in Vietnam and called for the recall of French High Commissioner d'Argenlieu to Vietnam. For example, "France-Soir" stated, "Protecting the lives of French people does not require bloodshed and forcing the Viet Minh government to surrender unconditionally. This goal can be achieved simply by ceasing to enslave the Viet Minh people and replacing it with a democratic approach. Furthermore, the recall of High Commissioner d'Argenlieu would ease the situation." Conversely, People's Republican Movement leader Schuman defended d'Argenlieu in an article published in "Le Monde," stating, "Some people like to talk about eliminating fascism. Now, in the Vietnam war, Japanese officers have been found among the aggressors, showing that residual forces still exist. We still remember the French army previously collecting evidence of Japanese atrocities. Can the Cha Son incident, which involved an attack, also be blamed on d'Argenlieu?"</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 27th] The French cruiser "Duquesne" passed through the Suez Canal today en route to Vietnam.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 26th] The giant passenger ship "Île de France," converted into a transport ship during the war and originally intended to be reconverted into a passenger ship, will, according to an announcement by the authorities, change plans and sail to North Africa this week, and then to Toulon to transport 9,000 troops to Vietnam as reinforcements.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Atomic Energy Commission Passes Technical Section of Report; Soviet Attitude Remains Ambiguous <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 26th] The Political Committee of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission held a meeting today and passed the technical section of its report by a majority of ten votes, with the Polish representative abstaining. Soviet representative Alexandrov stated that the Soviet delegation had not had time to study the contents of the report and therefore did not participate in the voting. The technical section of the report passed today is fifty pages long and is divided into five chapters: (1) a comprehensive report on the work of the Atomic Energy Commission since its establishment; (2) technical issues of controlling atomic energy; (3) various recommendations—this section is blank and will be filled in after the Executive Committee agrees on a control system; (4) the report submitted by the Expert Committee; (5) the report on the talks conducted by the representatives of the Atomic Energy Commission. From this, it can be seen that because the third chapter is blank, the content of the report passed today is purely technical and does not propose any recommendations on the system of controlling atomic energy. The plan drafted by US representative Baruch is scheduled to be submitted to the Executive Committee tomorrow along with Canada's recommendations. It is heard that Canadian representative McNaughton has returned home to consult with government authorities and is expected to return here tomorrow. The attitude of the Soviet representative remains an unknown factor. Although Soviet representatives Gromyko and Alexandrov have both refused to participate in the discussion, they will have to take a firm stance because the report must be submitted to the Security Council by December 31st.</p>

<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 26th] Mai The Chau, representative of the Viet Minh Republic in India, said tonight that General LeClerc's troops, along with more planes, tanks, warships, and paratroopers, are being sent to Vietnam. General LeClerc was the person who occupied Vietnam in 1945 with the help of the British Indian Army. Due to the large-scale French offensive, the Viet Minh Democratic Republic is in grave danger, and it is hoped that Indian compatriots will rise up to support it.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 26th] A Soviet radio commentator today criticized the Vietnam conflict for the first time. He stated, "The situation in Vietnam has undergone a serious change, attracting worldwide attention. Previously, in 1944, France formally allowed Vietnam autonomy within the French Union, and made the same statement after Vietnam's liberation. The implementation of this decision is in line with the spirit and principles of the United Nations, but it is still not enough to prevent the outbreak of conflict, and the disturbances are increasing. In March of this year, French Commissioner in Vietnam d'Argenlieu and Vietnamese Republic President Ho Chi Minh signed an agreement ending military actions between France and Vietnam, and recognizing the Viet Minh as a free republic. Later, on July 6th of this year, France and Vietnam held negotiations in Paris to discuss bilateral relations, but opinions were very divided until September 14th, and a temporary agreement was subsequently signed. Since then, Franco-Vietnamese relations have deteriorated, followed by military conflicts within Vietnam." The commentator concluded by quoting French left-wing newspapers as saying that French democrats are anxious about the bloodshed in Vietnam, and all friends of peace and security share this feeling.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Athens, 26th] The Greek government revealed that the commander of the Greek army brigade in Drama, 25 miles south of the Bulgarian border, sent a message to the Bulgarian authorities in Nevrokop, stating that guerrillas were using Bulgaria as a base. A week ago, guerrillas entered Greek territory from Bulgaria to harass it, but when Greek troops pursued them, they fled back into Bulgaria. The Greek commander warned the Bulgarian authorities that if such incidents occur again, Greek troops will continue to pursue them directly into Bulgarian territory. Official sources here also revealed that the Greek army authorities in Drama requested that the Bulgarian military commander come to negotiate border control matters, but the Bulgarian commander refused to meet, claiming that he had not received instructions from the central government. Greek Deputy Prime Minister Gonatas has returned to Athens after inspecting the northern border region. At the same time, the Greek government announced the formation of three cavalry units dedicated to suppressing bandits.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 27th] Kim Yong-in, chairman of the Korean Problems Research Association, issued two articles today, calling for the immediate and simultaneous withdrawal of US and Soviet troops from Korea.

We have never accepted the three powers' resolution to implement a five-year trusteeship over Korea. Currently, Korea is divided into two occupation zones, north and south, which hinders economic, political, and social reconstruction. I feel compelled to speak out about this. I hereby make the following requests: First, the demarcation line should be abolished. Second, Korea should be allowed to establish a provisional government without interference from the United States and the Soviet Union. Third, US and Soviet troops should withdraw immediately. Fourth, the provisional government has the right to hire foreign advisors. Fifth, the US, Soviet Union, UK, and China should guarantee Korea's sovereignty and guarantee to relinquish their political and economic privileges in Korea."</p>

<p>[United Press, New York, 26th] David Sarnoff, President of the Radio Corporation of America, said today that television will exert a significant effect for the first time in the 1948 presidential election, and the technology of campaign movements may also change as a result. Party conventions and presidential candidates can be captured by television cameras at that time. In 1924, Coolidge, Davis, Dawes, Cox, and Bryan were the first to use radio to deliver campaign speeches, which was widely regarded as miraculous as they could reach the public broadly, and campaign technology was greatly changed as a result. Television will be studied in the same way next year to make it an even more effective campaign tool in the 1948 presidential election, using both audio and video via radio transmission, and it will certainly be a further step in democratic institutions.</p>

<p>[United Press International, Washington, 26th] The House Un-American Activities Committee, through its consultant Adamson, has submitted a report accusing the American Communist Party of attempting to gain political control of the United States and intending to foment revolution through general strikes. The report also stated: (1) If a war breaks out between the US and the Soviet Union, the American Communist Party is prepared to launch a general strike by Communist unions and carry out large-scale industrial sabotage. (2) The Communist Party is engaged in organizing various political groups, whose ultimate goal is to overthrow the current government. Adamson also told reporters that the activities of Elliott Roosevelt, son of the late President Roosevelt, who recently returned from the Soviet Union, should be investigated to determine whether he has exceeded the scope of the Logan Act. This law prohibits US citizens from contacting foreign officials without legal permission in order to influence US foreign policy.</p>

<p>Japanese Troops More Brutal Than Beasts</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 26th] The Far East International Military Tribunal continued to try war criminals today, screening four reels of Japanese propaganda films, accompanied by commentary from survivors in the films. According to Dutch Deputy Prosecutor Dasselaar, the original films were sent to Australia to film the actual conditions in the Java prisoner-of-war camps. United Nations prisoners and detainees were forced to participate in the performances, and if they did not obey the orders of the Japanese directors, they were threatened with the starvation of their companions. The Japanese actors all performed in the best Hollywood style, with scenery, music, and abundant food and drink. A modern hospital was also filmed, equipped with the latest scientific equipment. The film was shot in 1942, when the Japanese army still dreamed of conquering Australia, and intended to use the film as propaganda to make Australians know that it was better to be under Japanese rule than to continue fighting. The luxurious Indonesian hotel in Batavia in the film was actually the location of the Japanese high command, and its large kitchen was used as the kitchen in the prisoner-of-war camp. Fish and meat were piled up like mountains, but in fact the prisoners could only see it being cooked and smell the aroma, and could not touch it at all, only for the enjoyment of the Japanese army. When filming this film, the Japanese army selected prisoners with better appearances in the Java concentration camps and ordered them to act. In reality, the prisoners were starving and had been hungry for half a year. After filming, the Japanese army drove them back to the dirty and unsanitary huts with bayonets and stripped them of their clothes. One scene was of Dutch prisoners seeing their families. The Japanese army searched for relatives of the prisoners in the concentration camps to make the performance realistic. When the camera stopped, the fathers, sons, husbands, and wives who had reunited for the first time since the Japanese occupied Java were immediately dragged away, and many never saw each other again.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Where Is Vandenberg Going? Three Major Issues Remain to Be Resolved <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 26th] Michigan Republican Senator Vandenberg is one of six people who may be elected president in 1948, and is also the key to US foreign policy in 1947. After the Republican Party won the election, he told the world that the US foreign policy would not change. However, Americans or people around the world have not forgotten that five years ago he was a famous isolationist who voted against conscription and the Lend-Lease Act. Based on his past political views, there are still three major issues that need to be answered in his future speeches:</p>
<p>(1) Isolationism: Vandenberg was still an isolationist at the time of the Pearl Harbor incident, but in a few months, he completely changed his style, admitted his past mistakes. Today, he and Byrnes are the founders of "bipartisan policy," but Vandenberg is the disciple of Senator Borah, the founder of American isolationism. Borah should bear a large part of the responsibility for the failure of the League of Nations. Whether Vandenberg will completely abandon his deep-rooted isolationist thinking in the future is still a question.</p>
<p>(2) Internationalism: Due to the progress of the war and the post-war tense situation, Vandenberg's concept of internationalism has become stronger. It is now generally known that he has exerted significant pressure on his Republican Party regarding some foreign policies, but not all of these pressures have been effective. For example, in the case of the Anglo-American loan, Vandenberg personally expressed his support, but most of the Republican Party opposed it. It is expected that when Congress discusses increasing the capital of the Export-Import Bank by $1.25 billion, most Republican members will oppose it, and Vandenberg himself has recently stated that the United States does not have enough financial resources to be a permanent donor to the world. Will Vandenberg support Byrnes at that time? Or agree with the opinion of Republican domestic policy expert Taft? The facts remain to be seen.</p>
<p>(3) Another issue is Vandenberg's past position in international trade policy. When Vandenberg adopted an isolationist stance, he strongly advocated that tariffs should be based on the difference between domestic and foreign production values. Today, the Republican Party still adopts this traditional tariff policy, which is in direct contrast to the tariff freedom policy of Byrnes and others. Vandenberg claims to have a bipartisan policy, but where he will go on this major economic policy remains to be seen. It is expected that answers to the above questions will be obtained in the first few months of the new year.</p>
<h3 id="e91">World Bank With Capital of 8 Billion US Dollars <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>... To separate international economics from international politics is an extremely difficult matter, as it has been in the past and remains so today.</p>
<p>The political disputes among nations controlled by the United States and the Soviet Union have hindered the smooth progress of the new World Bank's lending operations.</p>
<p>The World Bank's recent decision not to release relief loans is clearly related to the United States' dissatisfaction with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Due to UNRRA's international nature, although the United States contributed a large amount of money and supplies, it could not control their distribution. Therefore, when the United States had a dispute with Yugoslavia, even at its worst, UNRRA's relief supplies continued to flow to Yugoslavia. For this reason, American officials were clearly unwilling to repeat the same mistake when the World Bank opened.</p>
<p>When the United States Congress next convenes, some may advocate for "direct aid" to Greece, Italy, and Austria to compensate for the shortcomings left after UNRRA's work ends. However, Poland, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and other Eastern European countries are considered capable of managing on their own, at most receiving some private relief from the United States or other countries. If they seek assistance from the World Bank, they must submit detailed reconstruction plans, explaining the use of the loans; simply requesting emergency relief will not be effective.</p>
<p>Although the World Bank is also an international organization, it is not much different from UNRRA. However, in UNRRA, although the United States' contributions were greater than other countries, its voting power was not much greater than other countries. But in the World Bank, more than 35% of the voting rights are controlled by the United States. The allocation of voting rights is roughly proportional to the funds invested by each country. The total capital of the World Bank reaches 8 billion US dollars, of which the United States accounts for about 35%. At the same time, according to the bank's rules, any country requesting a loan must obtain the approval of the directly related country (for example, a loan in US dollars must be approved by the United States). Currently, almost all loan requests are based on US dollars as the standard. Therefore, when the World Bank makes decisions on loan issues, it will inevitably be linked to the United States' international policy. In addition, countries hoping to borrow have been slow to submit detailed applications because they know that it is futile to apply before the World Bank's lending capacity is established.</p>
<p>The World Bank's first batch of loans will likely go to France because France has long stated its intention to borrow 500 million US dollars for reconstruction work, and all aspects of the loan's use and repayment methods are ready. The Netherlands' request for a loan to cover the deficit in international trade is also unlikely to encounter any difficulties.</p>
<p>Poland's request for a loan of 600 million US dollars may not be easy to achieve immediately. It is recalled that in June this year, the United States government withheld a 40 million US dollar credit loan to Poland through the Export-Import Bank, requiring Poland to publish the commercial agreements it had signed with neighboring countries before proceeding with the loan.</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia may request a loan of 300 million US dollars, but its prospects are not necessarily smooth. In addition, Denmark will likely request 50 million US dollars, and Chile will likely request 40 million US dollars. Whether these will become reality remains to be seen.</p>
<p>It is currently difficult to predict the World Bank's outlook in its initial years of operation. According to experts inside and outside the bank, the World Bank's lending capacity in 1947 will be approximately 1.5 billion US dollars, reaching a peak of 8 billion US dollars by 1950. (See diagram)</p>
<p>As the World Bank's lending amount increases, new member countries may join, ensuring more funds to back the loans. As for now, although the World Bank has opened, it is still far from realizing the lofty goals set by the Bretton Woods financial conference. All countries participating in the World Bank feel that separating international economics from international politics is an extremely difficult matter, as it has been in the past and remains so today.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] World Bank Vice President Smith announced today that Colombia has become the 39th country to join the bank, with a subscription amount of 35 million US dollars. Since the establishment of the World Bank's twin organization, the International Monetary Fund, Colombia has been a member of the fund. However, the country's participation in the World Bank has been delayed until now due to domestic legal and technical reasons. There are five other countries that participated in the Bretton Woods Conference held in the summer of 1944 that can join the World Bank before the 31st of this month, but have not yet expressed their intention to join. These five countries are New Zealand, Australia, Venezuela, Liberia, and the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper] After the tragic incident in this city, where three passenger planes crashed in one night, resulting in more than 80 deaths and injuries, the Nanjing Ministry of Communications attached great importance to it. It specially sent Li Bohou, Director of the Aviation Administration Department, and Dai Anguo, Director of the Civil Aviation Administration, to Shanghai to offer condolences and supervise the handling of the aftermath. Li and Dai arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 AM yesterday and went to Longhua Airport around 9:00 AM to convene a meeting with senior officials from the Central Air Transport Corporation and the China National Aviation Corporation to listen to the companies' reports on the accident and casualties and to review the causes and responsibilities for the accident. The meeting ended at 12:00 PM.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Li and others went to the crash sites for on-site inspection. At around 4:00 PM, accompanied by personnel from the China National Aviation Corporation, they went to the Zhongshan Voice Academy to comfort the injured and pay respects to the deceased at the funeral homes.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Visiting Zhongshan Hospital <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The injured being treated at Zhongshan Hospital include six passengers from aircraft 140: Min Wanzhen, Zhang Qiyun, Liu Shengxiang, Chen A'er, Zhao Jixing, and Yu Lu Yin Huan; six passengers from aircraft 115: Zhang Chunhua, Wu Rongbing, Xue Jin Fan, Xu Weilong, girl Xu Liangyi, pilot Poulos; and a lively and healthy boy named Wang Didi.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Poulos Snores Loudly, Black-Clad Woman Smiles <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Led by staff from Zhongshan Hospital, Li and Dai went to various wards to offer condolences. The first person they saw was pilot Poulos, who was snoring loudly in bed. Except for his mouth and nose, his entire body was wrapped in bandages, and his feet were propped up with something. Zhang Chunhua, in another ward, had lighter injuries. A black-clad woman was diligently attending to her by the bedside, and both of them had smiles on their faces. The happiness they felt for being fortunate enough to survive was something that others could not imagine. It is no wonder that Director Li repeatedly said, "Blessed! Blessed!" Another injured person in the same room, Zhao Jixing, was being fed by a nurse. His father, a National Assembly representative from Liaoning Province, reportedly arrived at the hospital yesterday morning to visit him.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Chen A'er Talks Nonsense, Liu Shengxiang Had a Nightmare <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Chen A'er, in another ward, was still not fully conscious and was talking nonsense. Liu Shengxiang was able to recount the events before the accident, saying, "I felt dizzy at the time, and another female passenger on the plane gave me medicine to take. Suddenly, I felt the plane shake, and then I lost consciousness. When I woke up, I looked around the cabin and saw seven other people, five of whom were already dead." Another lightly injured person, Xue Jinfan, was being X-rayed at this time. Several other injured people were asleep. Director Li and Director Dai each left a card on everyone's bed to express their condolences. The most seriously injured was female passenger Yu Lu Cheng Huan. From the nurse's expression, it could be seen that her life was still in danger.</p>

<p>Wang Didi, who was unharmed, was sitting in bed, being fed porridge by a nurse. He was wearing a red floral cotton robe and had a chubby face. He was very cute, staring at people with his big eyes. The nurses and family members of other patients in the room were all gathered around him, teasing him. Everyone said that he was a child who "must have good fortune in the future." His safety and well-being not only surprised many people but also won the love of countless others.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Returning to Nanjing Today to Report <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>After leaving Zhongshan Hospital, they continued to go to various funeral homes to pay respects to the deceased and comfort the families. Finally, Director Li made a statement to reporters, saying: The bad weather was the main reason for the accident involving the three aircraft of the Central Air Transport Corporation and the China National Aviation Corporation, but the inadequacy of civil aviation facilities cannot be denied. Civil aviation in our country is still in the development stage, and it must not give people the feeling that air transport is like a long journey. After offering condolences to the injured and paying respects to the deceased today, I feel extremely saddened. Therefore, I feel even more that the improvement of civil aviation facilities is a matter of utmost urgency. Upon returning to Nanjing this time, I will report the situation to the authorities and try to improve it effectively. Considerable progress will be made by next year at the latest. Director Li and Director Dai are scheduled to return to Nanjing today to report and will bring with them pictorial reports from the China National Aviation Corporation and the Central Air Transport Corporation.</p>
<p>According to statistics, the losses due to the accident amounted to more than 2.5 billion yuan for the China National Aviation Corporation and the Central Air Transport Corporation.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper] On Christmas night, in the heavy rain and fog, the Central Air Transport Corporation and China National Aviation Corporation flights from Chongqing to Shanghai crashed in the suburbs of this city. It has been confirmed that only three aircraft were involved. The rumor that Central Air Transport Corporation aircraft XTT 38 was also missing is not true. When reporters went to Longhua Airport yesterday, they saw aircraft 38 safely parked at the airport. Moreover, according to a statement from the person in charge of the Central Air Transport Corporation, if another aircraft were indeed missing, the company would not need to conceal it and could not conceal it. In fact, aircraft 38 has not made any flights recently, so the outside world's reports are all misunderstandings. The company has now asked the Central News Agency to send a telegram nationwide to announce the truth.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper] Among the pilots and passengers of the three crashed aircraft, all eleven people on Central Air Transport Corporation aircraft 48 died. Of the fifteen people rescued from China National Aviation Corporation aircraft 140 and 115 and sent to Zhongshan Hospital, Yu Peng and an unknown child died of their injuries the night before. Yesterday, one more flight radio operator, Wang Xiaode, also passed away. Therefore, as of last night, the total number of deaths from the three passenger planes has increased to 69, including 11 from Central Air Transport Corporation aircraft 48, 34 from China National Aviation Corporation aircraft 115, and 24 from aircraft 140. There are still 12 injured people in Zhongshan Hospital, but among them, female passenger Yu Lu Yin Huan remains in a coma and her life is in danger. As for the unharmed four-year-old child, Wang Didi, no one has come to claim him yet.</p>
<p>In Zhangjiazhai, Jiangwan, in the destroyed civilian houses, other than one death, three injured people were treated at Gongji Hospital and are no longer in serious condition. Zhang Guoye, the head of the household, received the bad news in Nanjing and returned to Shanghai yesterday to handle the funeral arrangements.</p>
<p>Some of the bodies of the passengers who died in the crash, which were placed in the China, Universal, and Central Funeral Homes, were claimed by their families yesterday, and some have been embalmed. According to the persons in charge of the Central Air Transport Corporation and the China National Aviation Corporation, the funeral expenses of the deceased will naturally be borne by the company. If the family members claim the body and wish to handle the funeral themselves, the company is also willing to pay the same amount as the burial fee for those whose bodies are temporarily unclaimed. According to estimates from the funeral homes, this funeral expense is approximately 3.6 million yuan per body. In addition, according to government regulations, the company will also pay for the medical expenses of the injured and a compensation of 1 million yuan for each deceased, as well as 200,000 yuan for luggage compensation. However, the compensation and other amounts may be increased to show the company's apologies. The exact amount is still under negotiation and will be decided after consulting with the Ministry of Communications. The damaged civilian houses will also be compensated. The deceased pilots and radio operators will each receive a compensation of 5,000 to 10,000 US dollars.</p>

Among them, the fiancée of co-pilot Liu Linsen could not bear to see Liu's disfigured face and was overcome with grief. The mother of passenger Lu Jikang was even more like a madwoman, kneeling beside the body, stroking his head and feet, pressing her face tightly against his corpse, calling out "Jehovah" "Jehovah" and praying in a low voice.

Friends and relatives tried to persuade her to leave to avoid increasing her grief, but she still stroked the corpse and cried bitterly, and those who watched were saddened.</p>

Now, holding funeral shoes in her hand, she was touched by the sight and cried again. Yesterday, the New De茂寿衣店, which is affiliated to the China Funeral Home, had a thriving business.</p>

On the revenue side, due to the sluggish market, the revenue and expenditure are still significantly insufficient, so it is necessary to add the municipal construction surcharge on house rent and the municipal construction surcharge on public utilities in accordance with the resolution of the first session of the City Council.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Amendment to Tax Law Affects Revenue, Finance Bureau to Formulate Supplementary Measures, Feast Tax, Levied in Different Grades, Approved at Yesterday's Municipal Meeting <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Since the Central Legislative Yuan passed the reduction of feast tax and entertainment tax in various places, this city has consistently followed it. However, the Municipal Finance Bureau believes that the city's construction expenses require a large amount of funds, and the tax revenue is significantly insufficient. Although the new tax law has some difficulties in implementation, it is determined to try its best to comply. However, the feast tax has always been a major source of tax revenue in this city, and it is difficult to implement unless some changes are made. Therefore, the Finance Bureau has formulated supplementary measures on the premise of not violating the spirit of the original bill:</p>
<p>The collection of feast tax will still use the original 3,000 yuan as the starting point for taxation. Regardless of Chinese or Western cuisine, all feasts exceeding 3,000 yuan will be taxed. As for the new tax law, the tax rate is 10% for those exceeding the starting point by less than five times, and 20% for those exceeding the starting point by five times or more. However, the Finance Bureau believes that the price of each item is difficult to verify, so it is recommended to change it to divide restaurants into three grades (A, B, and C) based on their business equipment and whether they handle full table cuisine. Grade A restaurants will be taxed at 20%, Grade B restaurants will be taxed at 10%, and restaurants with music and dancing will be taxed at 25% as entertainment tax. Restaurants and dim sum shops that specialize in selling food for the common people will still be tax-exempt. The above method of grading and taxing the feast tax has been approved at the municipal meeting yesterday morning, but it will not be implemented until it is approved by the City Council.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Police Bureau Explains the Significance of Household Administration <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding recent reports in the newspapers stating that the city's household administration will be managed by the Civil Affairs Bureau next year, the Municipal Police Bureau indicated that there were some discrepancies. Yesterday, they issued a statement clarifying that the household survey conducted by the police bureau and the household administration work of the Civil Affairs Bureau are fundamentally different in nature. The police bureau's handling of household registration aims to understand the movements of the city's residents to maintain public order, focusing on "qualitative" management. On the other hand, the Civil Affairs Bureau's handling of household administration aims to determine the domicile and identity of the people, providing a basis for allocating rights and obligations, focusing on "quantitative" statistics. Their purposes and applications are distinctly different. Special investigations by the police on places with complex personnel situations and uneven quality are aimed at preventing the occurrence of harm, which is completely different from the household administration conducted by the Civil Affairs Bureau. Furthermore, the medical bureau's criminal records and population cards are specifically used to register wanted warrants and judgments from various military, administrative, and judicial agencies to investigate crimes, arrest wanted criminals, and implement control measures according to the Precautionary Law, all of which have practical effects. Yesterday, the bureau also received a telegram from the Ministry of Interior, forwarded by the Municipal Government, instructing that the original household survey institutions of the police bureau should be retained to handle investigations related to public security. Therefore, the bureau's household registration work will continue to follow the central government's orders, diligently and legally handle matters, without any changes.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In the case of embezzlement in the city government's reception of automobiles, the District Prosecutor's Office requested the Municipal Government to identify the 16 "repair fees" suspected of being involved, and the Municipal Government invited the Enemy Property Management Bureau and other agencies to cooperate with experts to handle the matter. However, because of the long interval, it is impossible to determine whether each vehicle was repaired at that time, and it is even more difficult to estimate whether the fees were appropriate. Those involved in the repair believe that there is obviously another reason, and the investigation team also paid attention to this point in the files handed over. However, all the evidence is not sufficient to determine the guilt of each defendant, and they cannot be prosecuted for the time being. The handling prosecutor is currently studying the invoices from the repair shops, hoping to find the truth from this clue.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Concrete Agreement Reached on Stabilizing Cotton Yarn Measures; Implementation Date Awaiting Approval; Separate Discussion on Cotton Yarn Purchase Cost <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The six points on stabilizing yarn prices, since Wang Qiyu of the Six District Cotton Spinning Association visited President Song a few days ago for further consultations, have already reached a concrete agreement. Yesterday, the six points were finally successfully passed at the general meeting of the Six District Cotton Spinning Association held at 2:00 PM. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the Spinning Management Committee held an expanded meeting. Wu (concurrently chairman), Li (vice chairman), and committee members Shu Zizhang, Wang Qiyu, Wang Yangxian, Wu Weijing, Tang Xinghai, Guo Dihuo, Rong Yixin, and Liu Wenteng, director of the committee's business department, submitted the six points for discussion. With slight annotations, they were passed. However, the issue of the implementation date of the new plan is still awaiting President Song's approval. In addition, regarding the government's purchase of cotton spinning prices, it was decided that national and private yarn factories would each nominate three representatives to agree on the accounting items for calculating costs at the Jiangxi Road Spinning Construction Company at 10:00 AM today, and then calculate their costs separately. The Spinning Construction Company has already nominated Cai Huimin and other three representatives, while private factories have nominated representatives from Yongan, Shenxin, and Qingfeng factories. In addition, the fourth batch of the fourth phase of replicated industry-allocated yarn will be distributed after the new negotiated price is approved. The six points of the "Measures to Stabilize Yarn Prices" passed by the Spinning Management Committee are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Measures to Stabilize Cotton Yarn Prices</p>
<p>(1) For yarn factories that have purchased or intend to purchase foreign cotton, the government will purchase half of the cotton yarn produced from January 1, 1947. If the cotton yarn is used to weave cloth, the government may purchase the cotton cloth. Note: This will be implemented temporarily in yarn factories in the Shanghai urban area.</p>
<p>(2) The purchase price will be the cost plus a 20% profit. The purchase price will be determined by a review meeting organized by one representative appointed by the Spinning Management Committee and one representative each from the Spinning Construction Company and private yarn factories.</p>
<p>(3) The remaining yarn and cloth, except for those purchased, will be concentrated by each factory in the market for open trading. The buyer's name, amount, and purpose of the above transactions must be compiled into a detailed table and submitted to the competent authority for review on a daily basis. Note: In addition to opening yarn in its own factory, each factory shall report the quantity of yarn opened on that day to the designated market manager (the designated location is temporarily in the Yarn Industry Association).</p>
<p>(4) The government will use all the purchased yarn and cloth to balance yarn and cloth prices. If the allocation price is higher than the purchase price, the surplus will be stored by the government in a special account for the purpose of subsidizing cotton production and developing the textile industry.</p>
<p>(5) Hereafter, for any yarn factory that purchases cotton with foreign exchange supplied by the government, 50% of the yarn and cloth produced will be purchased by the government. The purchase price will be the cost plus a 20% profit. Yarn and cloth made from domestically produced cotton may be bought and sold by themselves according to Article 3.</p>
<p>(6) These measures will be terminated when yarn and cloth market prices are relatively stable.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Frequent Market Fluctuations; Gold, Stocks, and Currency Unpredictable; Gold and Currency Surge Again; Chinese Stocks Rise and Fall <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Strong Gold and Currency Absorption: The scarlet fever (referring to intense speculation) continued to rise gradually yesterday amid actual sales and short covering. The morning opened at 3.35 million, and after opening, it rose from 3.33 million to 3.42 million due to reports that financial panic was being maintained. There was some pressure at higher levels and it fell back to 3.34 million. However, people's minds were settled, and the situation was stable. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 134 bars at a price of 3.38 million. After that, under the agitation of retail buyers, it repeatedly pulled up. The supply was sluggish, and the high price approached 3.5 million. There was still a small amount of pressure at higher levels. At noon, it was around 3.45 million. In the afternoon, it rebounded again. The next-day delivery opened and jumped to over 3.5 million. The Central Bank supplied at higher levels, and floating longs sold, and the market retreated to 3.28 million near the close. As a result, it fell another 20,000 compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments were listed at 35,000, and silver ingots and silver dollars were flat. The underground overnight interest rate was slightly loose, with interest rates ranging from 1.6 to 1.8 fen.</p>
<p>Foreign Currencies Gradually Stabilizing: The initial black market price of US dollars started at a buying price of 6,250 yuan. At noon, the price rose to about 6,500 yuan. In the afternoon, the high price reached 6,700 yuan, but later, due to the sharp decline in gold prices, it fell back to 6,300 yuan at the close, resulting in a slight increase of 150 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars fell by 30 yuan due to the urgent need for cash from Cantonese merchants. The Hong Kong exchange rate once fell to 1,210 yuan. As gold and currency rebounded, there was still a supply at 1,250 yuan at noon. Indian exchange was 1,525 yuan, and British exchange was 20,000 yuan, all selling prices, with few transactions.</p>
<p>Government Bonds Slightly Stable Yesterday: Miscellaneous Class A and B bonds were absorbed by 604 offices and were relatively firm. Unified Class C opened at 1,580 yuan in the morning, and started at 1,600 yuan. It was sold by two major players on the fifth floor and fell back to 1,430 yuan. Near the close, it was still above 1,450 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, Class A and B rose by 120 yuan, Class C rose by 30 yuan, Class D rose by 50 yuan, and Class E rose by 70 yuan. The transaction volume was approximately 3 million yuan.</p>
<p>Stock Market Absorption Not Weak: The Chinese stock market saw good news yesterday, but people in the industry were forced to end contra-trading within the year due to the end of the year, and there was no talk of rolling it over. There were too many retail longs, so there were many obstacles to rising. The market closed at a low price. The morning opened slightly higher due to reports boosting buying. After opening, it was weakened by the supply outside the market. 207, 199, 14, 99, and 229 were sold, gradually declining. After 10 o'clock, due to the very stable gold market, it rose slightly under the addition of 89. Later, as gold prices rose, 178 and others also purchased and rose to above 640 yuan. Rong then sold to the limit through 151, with slight struggles. 83, 145, 89, 233, 154, 151, and 198 were continuously purchased. The forward Yongsheng rose to 654 yuan after 11:15. 207, 171, 215, and 178 were sold. Near noon, the gold market also fell back, and retail longs scrambled to sell. The noon close saw weakness. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yongsheng and Qinxing fell slightly, Meiya, Xinyi, Jingfu, and Xinguang rose slightly, and Huafeng was flat. Cold stocks, Jingfu, stopped rising, matches rose by half, Qing'an fell by nearly 20%, and the rest rose slightly. Forward delivery, Yongsheng and Xinyi rose slightly, Xinguang, Qinxing, and Huafeng were flat, and Meiya rose by half.

Current Yongsheng rose to 645 yuan. 185 was sold and once fell back by more than 10 yuan. However, the gold market was even more attractive. 229, 198, and 145 entered again, and a high price of 648 yuan was seen. 185, 224, 4, 14, and 16 continuously supplied. The gold price suddenly plummeted and finally broke below 600 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yongsheng and Xinguang each fell by about half, Meiya, Huafeng, and Xinyi fell slightly, and Qinxing and Jingfu rose slightly. Cold stocks, matches, rose by 10%, Zhongfang Datong rose slightly, Jingxing and Huafeng were flat, and the honor and disgrace of each stock outside the market was subtle.</p>

<p>The Central Bank's Foreign Exchange Examination Office recently notified all designated foreign exchange banks that import goods purchased from countries in the Sterling Bloc are only allowed to apply for pounds sterling, while import goods purchased from the United States, Canada, the Philippines, and Latin America may be approved for settlement in US dollars.</p>

<p>The phenomena of financial unrest have now gradually become a thing of the past. Several banks that were rumored to be wavering have all passed through smoothly. According to a person in charge of the Central Bank, the Central Bank is paying close attention to the unfortunate events in the financial sector. The inspection work of financial institutions is currently being intensified. The Central Bank is strictly supervising the liquidation work of the exchange shops that have been suspended. If they apply for resumption of business after liquidation is completed, they will be seriously considered to avoid the recurrence of unfortunate events.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Italian Rayon Arrives in Shanghai for Sale; Price Slightly Higher than the Allotted Price <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>It is reported that Italian rayon has recently arrived in considerable quantities. Last week, a certain merchant in the city intended to sell 300 boxes of Italian rayon to the China Trust Bureau, but the China Trust Bureau only agreed to purchase it if the selling price was lower than the allotted price, so the transaction did not go through. It is heard that before the war, the annual import of Italian rayon into China was about 20,000 boxes, while Japanese rayon was between 60,000 and 80,000 boxes. Before the war, the average monthly demand for rayon in China was about 9,000 boxes, but most manufacturers at that time used Japanese rayon because each box had extra pounds. The specified number of pounds per box of rayon is 200 pounds, but Japanese rayon at that time wanted to occupy the Chinese market, so the number of pounds per box was between 205 and 206 pounds. However, there is no such preference in the current barter period. It is also heard that the China Trust Bureau has approved quota applications for rayon for various industries this month, and there are still more than 100 boxes that have not been allocated. It is now decided to hold a final allocation next Monday (30th). If no application is made after the deadline, it will be considered a waiver. As for the miscellaneous brands of rayon sold in the market recently, it is heard that most of them are Italian goods, and their prices are about 400,000 yuan higher than the allotted price.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Caustic Soda Plummets <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>In the raw material market yesterday, due to the tightening of credit, raw material prices generally fell. Sodium nitrate (Chilean nitrate) fell from 28 million yuan per ton to 16 million yuan. Glycerin and sweet potato prices remained at the original level. Caustic soda fell the most sharply. Yesterday, the market price was 2.9 million yuan per barrel, and a small amount was traded at 2.2 million yuan. Although the price has fallen by 1 million yuan, because user factories are also tight on credit, no one is buying it. Today's market is likely to see an astonishing fall. In fact, caustic soda and soda ash among the raw materials are generally considered to be no different from gold. Once they are sold, the position can be converted, so there are still a large number of buyers waiting for positions.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The British shipping company's Deloraine left Shanghai for Europe yesterday afternoon, carrying a total of more than 1,700 tons of goods, including more than 500 boxes of tea, 44 tons of tung oil, about 100 bales of Huzhou silk, more than 800 pieces of pig bristles, and 814 tons of cottonseed cake shipped to London. These exports were rare even before the war, and this is the first time that such items have been exported to Europe from this city since the victory. In addition, a large amount of cotton yarn and piece goods were shipped to Guangdong. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Zhongkai ship exported 874 pieces of piece goods and 601 pieces of pharmaceuticals from the Executive Yuan the day before yesterday, as well as 1,149 pieces of cotton yarn from the China Textile Corporation, and more than 5,440 packages of raw peanuts and 51 pieces of raw oil to Guangzhou.</p>

<p>Although the Shanghai Municipal Management Committee and the Municipal Government have strictly banned the black market for cotton yarn, it has not yet disappeared. Furthermore, the black market yarn prices have changed drastically during the recent financial turmoil, with wide fluctuations. The No. 6 District Silk Yarn Industry Association, in order to eliminate speculation by outsiders, intends to restore the organization of the exchange during the period when the authorities allow yarn factories to trade freely. The matter has been submitted to the Spinning Management Committee for approval, and preparations are underway to restore the former cotton yarn exchange market on Zhongzheng East Road. The preparations will be presided over by Wang Qiyu, chairman of the Spinning Management Committee, and are expected to be realized within January next year.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Yongxing Gold Shop Manipulates Speculation; Authorities Send Personnel to Seal and Investigate <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Social Bureau, Finance Bureau, Police Bureau, and Public Utilities Bureau, etc., recently received reports stating that Yongxing Gold Shop at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road in this city is suspected of manipulating speculation in the gold market, selling short, and operating underground banks. Therefore, at 6:00 PM the other day, they jointly dispatched personnel to the shop and sealed up more than 100 interphone telephones. It is learned that the shop has been open for many years and has been trading quite actively on weekdays, and has invisibly become a concentrated market for gold trading. Therefore, the gold market trading was quite chaotic yesterday after it was sealed the other day. Yesterday, the reporter specifically visited Chen Ruitang, the person in charge of the shop, who said: This shop has a considerable history of operating gold trading. On weekdays, it accepts the entrustment of various customers and buys and sells for them. There has never been a way to open gold futures with only 30% margin. On weekdays, it occasionally borrows and lends to peers due to the surplus or deficit of its own positions. This is a common business practice in the general financial industry and cannot be compared with the so-called underground bank business. Now the shop has submitted all account books to the Municipal Finance Bureau for investigation. Whether it is right or wrong will have its own final factual proof.</p>
<h3 id="e160">There are a Total of Seventeen Sichuan Banking and Money Shops in this City <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>A reporter was recently told by a leading figure in Sichuan banking that, apart from the Juxingcheng Bank, which has a considerable position in Shanghai's financial community and is a leader among Sichuan banks, there are also Sichuan Meifeng, Hecheng, Chongqing Commercial, Chuankang, Chuanfeng, Yaxi, Fuhua, Yongcheng, Dayu, Sichuan Agricultural and Industrial, Tonghui, Yifeng, Chengdu Commercial, Taiyu, and Huitong, a total of fifteen banks, as well as Yongqing, Yifeng, and Yongsheng, a total of three money shops, making a total of nineteen banking and money shops.</p>

<p>A person in charge of the Pipe Committee told reporters today that the soaring prices this time are rumored to be affected by the fact that the import quota figures of the committee have not yet been announced, and that the application procedures for licenses are slow. This rumor is actually one-sided. Since the committee started handling the issuance of import licenses, as of yesterday, more than 1,000 first-class licenses and more than 15,000 second- and third-class licenses have been approved. The issue of import quotas is also being actively studied recently and will be announced soon.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Banking Commercial Industry Association recently re-revised the draft of the Provisional Measures for Banning Customer Returned Checks. The revised draft is recorded below: Article 1: In addition to customers well-known to the bank, customers opening check accounts with the bank should have a guarantor recognized by the bank. Article 2: If a customer issues a check exceeding the deposit or overdraft limit and the bank returns the check, the returning bank should issue a written warning and charge a returned check handling fee of 1/1000 of the face value of the check, but not less than 1,000 yuan in national currency each time. Article 3: If a customer issues a check with the situation in the preceding article and the check is returned three times, the returning bank believes that the account is intentional and should immediately stop its dealings and report the customer's account name, name, address, etc. to the Banking Industry Association, and the association will send a confidential letter to each member bank for reference. Article 4: If the collecting bank discovers a customer who meets the circumstances of the preceding article, it may also report it to the association for verification. Article 5: If the bank does not implement the provisions of these measures properly, resulting in too many returned checks, it will be sanctioned by the Banking Commercial Industry Association.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Rice Market Arrivals Not Many, Market Continues to Weaken <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, rice arrivals were not plentiful. The south market saw 940 dan, and the north market 2653 dan. Relevant personnel indicated that the reasons for the scarce arrivals were: firstly, rainy weather reduced the activity of vendors; secondly, tight credit in the city led to rice shops being less enthusiastic about stocking up. Close attention is now being paid to the arrival quantity in the next few days. If scarcity persists, necessary measures will be taken. Rice prices are quite stable, with Changshu rice in the north market at 63,000 yuan per dan.</p>
<p>Another report: The rice market yesterday, with the weather turning sunny, saw softened sentiment. Buyers showed no intention to resist, and sellers relaxed. The market was filled with selling pressure. Northern japonica rice continued to fall by 1,000-2,000 yuan, and southern japonica rice further dropped by 2,000-3,000 yuan. Baiyuan and Yinyuan rice gradually decreased by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Youmi rice saw few transactions. Flour prices were high inland, but with Canadian flour continuing to arrive in Shanghai today, the supply source was unblocked, leading to a stabilizing situation. Wheat bran was sluggish, continuing to weaken by 100-200 yuan. Soybean cake imports from Shantou were still acceptable, but with oil mills continuously supplying, prices rose slightly by 100 yuan. Cowpeas continued to be purchased in Shantou and remained strong. Mung beans were in demand. Red beans were temporarily stable. Corn continued to be absorbed by Qingdao, and the market situation was firm. Red sorghum remained stable. Sesame continued to be widely sold, rising by 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts saw active but not strong sales, with no gains or losses. Broad beans were mediocre. Soybeans saw no strong arrivals or sales, forming a stagnant situation. The oil market was sluggish, with sesame oil falling by 2,000-3,000 yuan, soybean oil down slightly by 1,000-2,000 yuan, and rapeseed oil weak and flat. Barrelled raw oil also declined by 2,000-3,000 yuan, but unrefined oil still saw continued seller support, rising by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Various grains are temporarily trending towards stability and weakness.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Yarn Market Stops Decline, Rebounds <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market stopped declining and rebounded, as the previous losses had been significant. In addition, rising gold prices prompted those in the industry to tighten sales due to substantial losses on hand. As a result, various yarn counts and threads rose by 30,000-80,000 yuan. Sentiment has thus stabilized somewhat, unlike the listless situation of the past few days.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Import Merchants Significantly Reduce Orders <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Recently, an import firm informed the reporter that after the implementation of import controls this time, orders to foreign countries have been greatly reduced. The failure to settle foreign exchange for most goods is one reason, but the main reason is that most merchants are uninterested in placing orders due to the indefinite arrival of goods. As for the price increase of domestic inventory, it is inevitable. For example, copper, tin, hardware and other supplies are still rising in price recently.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Dumping of Japanese Goods, Very Likely to Be Shipped to China, South Seas Deserve Special Attention <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] It is rumored that next year Japanese goods will be dumped on a large scale into China. When the reporter inquired to relevant personnel, it was indicated that, based on the speed of Japan's industrial recovery, this matter is quite possible. However, in the near future, if Japanese goods are openly imported in large quantities, it will definitely be prohibited by our government. Therefore, it is necessary to disguise them as goods from other countries to enter our market. This year, some people have already used Japan's low labor costs and skilled techniques to weave silk in Japan with our country's exported raw silk, selling it to other countries under the name "China Silk," which is actually Japanese goods. With this precedent, in the future, some people may use Japanese labor and raw materials to set up factories in Japan or form partnerships with Japanese people in other ways, importing their finished products into our country in large quantities. This deserves close attention. As for the Japanese side sending personnel to Southeast Asia for business activities, although there is no definite evidence, it is highly possible.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Extremely Tight Credit, Silk Market Continues to Weaken <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's silk market conditions continued to weaken due to extremely tight credit. Artificial silk 120 High Mountain brand, with luster, was initially quoted at 3.27 million yuan in the morning, but the selling sentiment in the market was strong, almost retreating to 3.22 million yuan. The Toyo brand had relatively fewer goods and slightly higher prices, sold at 3.35 million yuan, a decrease of 50,000-60,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The remaining semi-luster and 150 luster remained at the original price. Transactions between factories and distributors were scarce, and sentiment was weak. Yesterday's quoted prices were all reduced by about 100,000 yuan. Silk fabrics also trended downward. Quilted covers and checkered crepe, although quoted at the original price of the previous day, saw no transactions. Huajin crepe fell another 50 yuan yesterday.</p>

<p>Jinshan longan twigs saw rising production prices, while exchange rates shrunk. This increased costs, and the Shanghai price was around 280,000 yuan. As a result, the Shanghai market was invigorated. Yesterday, the market price for registered longan twigs rose to 286,000 yuan, an increase of 30,000-40,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The market is still wary of further tightening, as the difference compared to dried longan is still significant.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Finance recently instructed customs authorities that, for exported goods with settled foreign exchange, which are transported by sea or cross the land border for re-import and domestic sale, and must pass through foreign ports or foreign territory, except for vessels engaged in regular trade according to ordinary transportation regulations, if transported by other vehicles, private ships, or steamers, merchants should be required to pay a 30% guarantee deposit for release. This guarantee deposit should be verified by the original Shanghai customs office based on the report form endorsed and returned by the customs office at the designated destination. If there is no customs office at the destination, the deposit will be returned upon verification of documents certified by the local county government, chamber of commerce, or trade association. If the reporting person cannot present the above report form or certification documents, the customs office may transfer the entire guarantee deposit to the national treasury.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Green Tea Sales to the Philippines Very Brisk <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>In the foreign tea market, British export firms demanded high-end aged Keemun tea, but transactions failed to materialize due to a lack of sellers. However, the Zhenzhen and Zhenmei green teas destined for Africa have been selling well recently, and the market is quite promising. According to industry sources, a certain tea company is currently interested in aged pearl tea, but the existing stock is even more depleted, resulting in a fruitless search. The transaction volume is extremely bleak, while prices remain firm, with prospects possibly soaring to the sky. As for Hua tea sales to the United States, it is still difficult to expand, as prices do not match each other's tastes. In addition, this year's Japanese tea exports to the United States have reached 7.5 million pounds. Therefore, there is a wait-and-see attitude towards our country's tea. Domestic sales of red and green tea are experiencing a more severe decline, and people's faces are showing increasing anxiety.</p>

The current price of middle-grade white sugar in the council's registered price was still flat at the beginning, at 145,000 yuan, then dropped to 137,000-137,500 yuan. Raw red sugar was 130,000 yuan to 128,000 yuan. The degree of decline was nearly 10,000 yuan. Shantou green opened at 124,000 yuan, down slightly by 2,000 yuan. Runde green was 113,000 yuan to 110,000 yuan, a decrease of more than 10,000 yuan compared to the 24th. More than 300 bags were traded. Xinghua white sugar was 163,000 yuan, Xinghua red sugar was 158,000 yuan to 155,000 yuan, and the next grade was 152,000 yuan, with about 300 transactions.</p>

<p>[United Press, Yule, 27th] The American Davis Cup team of 克拉茂 (Kramo?) and 许洛特 (Xu Luote?) today defeated the Australian team of 勃朗维区 (Blangweiqu?) and 奎斯脱 (Kuisite?) in straight sets in the doubles match: 6-2, 7-5, 6-4. They reclaimed the Davis Cup, the world tennis championship, lost in 1938. Tomorrow's final two singles matches are irrelevant to the outcome. The Australian team had won the cup from the American team in 1939. With the outbreak of World War II, the competition was suspended. Today, the sun was quite strong, and there were approximately 14,000 spectators. 克拉茂 (Kramo?) and 许洛特 (Xu Luote?) put on a peak performance, which was extremely精彩(jingcai) [brilliant, wonderful]. Although the Australian team fought with all their strength, they were ultimately no match for the American team's speed and accuracy. In the first set, the American team immediately won four consecutive games, establishing a resounding momentum and winning with 6-2. In the second set, the Australian team fought hard to tie the score at 5-5. 许洛特 (Xu Luote?) broke 奎斯脱 (Kuisite?)'s serve and then won his own service game, winning the second set with 7-5. 奎斯脱 (Kuisite?) was the weaker member of the Australian team. 许洛特 (Xu Luote?) was a major contributor to the American team's victory. 克拉茂 (Kramo?) performed as usual, but this young Californian 许洛特 (Xu Luote?) was even more outstanding. 许洛特 (Xu Luote?)'s selection was only decided at the last minute, replacing 派克 (Paike?) as the second singles player, and partnering with 克拉茂 (Kramo?) in doubles. His defeat of the ambidextrous general 勃朗维区 (Blangweiqu?) was a surprise. Since the Davis Cup competition began in 1902, this is the American team's tenth victory.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Teaching Demonstration <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Ma Jingxuan</p>
<p>Teaching demonstration is the most effective activity for guiding teachers' professional development and improving teaching methods. The holding of a teaching demonstration involves the principal, supervisors, or educational research groups inviting a teacher to use a model teaching method to present the teaching process in a very approachable manner, giving the observing teachers a correct impression.</p>
<p>The educational research associations in each district of Shanghai have frequently held teaching demonstrations this semester. This research trend began as early as the pre-victory era, in 1935, when two educators, Chen Heqin and Chen Xuanshan, presided over the Shanghai Special District Education Administration, and they had already earnestly promoted it. Now, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau's Supervisory Office and the National Education Department use this as the central work for guiding teachers' professional development, and all teachers in the city are actively participating.</p>
<p>Because teaching demonstrations have a special effect on improving teaching methods, it is indeed necessary to advocate and promote them. Here are the points that should be paid attention to when holding a demonstration, for the reference of institutions or individuals in the education sector who are responsible for guiding teachers' professional development.</p>
<p>(1) Before holding a teaching demonstration, supervisors and teachers undertaking the demonstration should hold a meeting to jointly determine the content and method of the demonstration so that the demonstrator knows the focus of this demonstration so that the observers can easily understand.</p>
<p>(2) Some teaching processes are not suitable for demonstration and may be changed to make them easier to observe.</p>
<p>(3) Before the demonstration teaching, the responsible teacher may first try teaching it once and prepare lesson plans to gain familiarity.</p>
<p>(4) During the demonstration, supervisors should attend with the observing teachers.</p>
<p>(5) During the observation, a teacher should be publicly selected to take shorthand notes, recording the teaching process as a basis for after-the-fact discussion.</p>
<p>(6) After the demonstration teaching is completed, a discussion should be held immediately.</p>
<p>(7) At the beginning of the discussion, the teacher responsible for the demonstration should report on the usual teaching routines, teaching techniques, and the flexible use of this teaching process.</p>
<p>(8) If the observers have any questions, they should raise them immediately and ask the teacher responsible for the demonstration to answer them.</p>
<p>(9) Observers should raise questions about the advantages and disadvantages of what they have observed and discuss them together. The original teaching demonstration is not necessarily a model teaching, so feel free to criticize it.</p>
<p>(10) The teacher responsible for the demonstration should be changed frequently, and should not be undertaken by only a few people.</p>
<p>Teaching demonstration is a good system for supervisors to guide teachers to improve teaching, and it is easiest to obtain teachers' sympathy and understanding. It is worth introducing and promoting, and educational research groups and schools across the country may want to try it.</p>

<h3 id="e201">National Identity Cards May Not Be Confiscated Arbitrarily; Municipal Government Issues Separate Orders for Public Notice <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government has recently received reports that a small number of unscrupulous personnel, taking advantage of their positions, are inspecting people's identity cards without cause, and some have even arbitrarily confiscated, detained, tampered with, or torn them up, which is intentionally disturbing the people. Yesterday, a special order was issued to the Municipal Police Bureau and the district offices to correct and stop this, and a letter was sent to the Songhu Garrison Command ordering them to pay attention to supervision and enforcement. A public notice was also issued, the original text of which is recorded below:</p>
<p>It is hereby announced that the national identity card is a document proving the identity of the holder. According to Article 6 of the Shanghai Municipal Government's Measures for Issuing National Identity Cards: "When people exercise their rights or bear obligations, the competent authority may order the presentation of the national identity card, but it shall not be detained or confiscated." Article 3 of the National Identity Card Precautions issued by the central government stipulates that "Governments at all levels, judicial and security agencies, and the head of the district baojia may, when necessary, order the holder to hand over the identity card for inspection, but shall not detain or confiscate it." Therefore, military and police agencies at all levels shall not conduct inspections without cause, except when necessary for official duties, and shall not arbitrarily detain, confiscate, or even tear them up. However, according to recent reports, a small number of unscrupulous personnel have been taking advantage of their positions to inspect people's identity cards without cause, and some have even arbitrarily confiscated, detained, tampered with, or torn them up. This not only violates laws and regulations but is also intentionally disturbing the people. We hereby reiterate the previous order, earnestly correcting and stopping this. If the above-mentioned situation occurs again in the future, the people may report it at any time, and this government will immediately punish them severely. In addition to separate letters, this notice is hereby issued for public notice.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Agricultural and Forestry Enterprises in Hainan Island: An Interview with Forestry Expert Mr. Chen Yangcai <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Report from Nanjing, 8th [of the month] by Bo Ying</p>
<p>Professor Chen Zhi (style name Yangcai) is one of our country's few forestry experts. In recent years, he has transitioned from being a scholar to being involved in politics, serving as a technical officer in the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. After the Japanese surrendered last year, he was ordered to go to Hainan Island to handle the takeover. Recently, he returned from Qiongyai [Hainan Island] and gave an academic lecture at Jinling University in Nanjing on November 26th, entitled "Agricultural and Forestry Enterprises in Hainan Island." The content was rich and extensive, and the analysis was clear and detailed. After respectfully listening to the lecture, I visited Mr. Chen's residence on the 3rd of this month to ask for his advice. Mr. Chen was patient and meticulous in his instructions. I believe that what he said is deeply significant and relevant to the national economy and the people's livelihood, so I have specifically recorded and published it to promote the attention of the people of our country.</p>
<p>Virgin Land of Resources</p>
<p>Hainan Island is a large island off the southern coast of our country. Together with Taiwan, it is known as the two eyes of China. After the victory, Taiwan and Hainan Island were successively recovered. However, because Taiwan has been developed by the Japanese for 50 years and has its scale, the authorities have specially set up an independent administrative system to operate it. Newspapers and magazines compete to report on the situation and news of Taiwan, which has aroused widespread and enthusiastic attention from the people of the country, which is a gratifying phenomenon. The authorities have not paid much attention to the Hainan Island issue, and newspapers and magazines have rarely recorded and reported it. No wonder Mr. Chen said painfully that we cannot let China be blindly ignorant and indifferent.</p>
<p>Hainan Island, also known as Qiongyai, is located between 18 and 20 degrees north latitude and 108 and 110 degrees east longitude. The soil is fertile, and the climate is warm like the tropics, making it a virgin land for agricultural resources. Before the war, our country was unable to reach it, letting it lie barren. However, the Japanese had coveted it for more than a day. Therefore, after invading on February 10, 1939, they made planned arrangements, preparing to occupy it for a long time and develop it, making it the second Taiwan. A Hainan Island Agricultural Policy Committee was specially established to manage all agricultural and forestry enterprises on the island, including all agricultural improvements, agricultural product processing, and the allocation of various agricultural and forestry companies. A total of 28 units of powerful agricultural and forestry companies from within the country, Taiwan, and the South Seas were ordered to come and set up operations, including agricultural companies, forestry companies, industrial companies, fishery companies, food processing enterprises, and water conservancy enterprises. The total investment of each project was 137 million yuan. The total investment of the Japanese in Hainan Island was 600 million yuan, accounting for just under 23% of their total investment. And the expenses handled by a part of the Navy were not included. Each agricultural and forestry company proceeded in sequence according to the plan. Although there were differences in the order of establishment and the scale, each had its own goals and worked hard. Losses over the years were not taken into account, as they were said to be national policy companies, which were incomparable to private enterprises that only aim to make profits.</p>
<p>Qiongyai agriculture is dominated by crops, which can be divided into three categories: food crops, special-purpose crops, and horticultural crops.</p>
<p>Content of Crops</p>
<p>Regarding food crops, the island's agriculture is almost entirely dominated by this type of crop, with rice in the northeast and sweet potatoes in the southwest being the most important. This is due to the northeast being humid and the southwest being dry. Moreover, because it is located in the tropics, rice can be harvested three times a year, and sweet potatoes can be harvested four times a year, which can be said to be blessed by nature. However, because the land has not been fully utilized and people have not exerted their full efforts, food is still insufficient, and there is still reliance on the import of foreign rice, which is regrettable. The Japanese once tried planting Taiwan's Ponlai rice in Qiongyai and achieved good results. With further efforts, the solution to the food problem on the island is not difficult. Unfortunately, after the agricultural companies were taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Military Affairs, they were not well managed, and the Ponlai rice seeds were lost, and a good foundation was destroyed overnight, which is painful to speak of. Regarding sweet potatoes, the Japanese spared no effort in introducing new varieties for cultivation and preventing and controlling diseases and pests. It is estimated that in five years, the planting area can be increased to 50,000 hectares. If the unit yield is increased by 300 kilograms per hectare per year due to the popularity of improved varieties and the improvement of cultivation, then the total production of sweet potatoes on the island can reach a huge 37.5 million kilograms per year, which can not only supplement the island's food shortage but also greatly benefit the production of liquid fuel. In the past seven years, the Japanese have also tirelessly selected improved varieties of beans, wheat, cassava, etc., and promoted them widely, with remarkable results.</p>
<p>Special-purpose crops include sugarcane for sugar production, peanuts and sesame for oil production, cotton, jute, ramie for fiber, and tobacco. Sugarcane and the sugar production industry related to it are the most promising agricultural operations on the island. Some even believe that its value exceeds that of Taiwan. Because of the relationship between sunshine and temperature, the ripening period of sugarcane in the southwest can be shortened by half a year compared to the year and a half required in Taiwan, and the sugar content is also richer than that produced in Taiwan. Therefore, the Japanese are also particularly diligent in their operation. Although their achievements are not yet sufficient to demonstrate its characteristics, it will not be difficult to obtain excellent results if we wait a few more years. Peanuts and sesame are also important agricultural products of Hainan Island. In addition to meeting the needs of the island, their seeds, fruits, and oil are transported to Hong Kong and Guangdong. The production locations are almost all over the island, and the yield is very high. The Japanese also have new-style oil mills, which further help the promotion of oil crops. Because Qiongyai is on the same isotherm and rainfall line as the world's cotton-producing areas (southern North America, northern India, and Egypt, etc.), it is also a suitable planting area for cotton. Only because the island's climate is mild throughout the year, providing convenience for the life of diseases and insects, the Japanese tried to plant excellent varieties of Egyptian cotton and American cotton systems. As a result, although the diseases were not very severe, the insect pests were rampant, and there were rarely excellent results. However, these are all difficulties that can be overcome by human effort. With effort, it should not be difficult to eradicate them. Although there is not much jute and ramie planted, if we engage in reclamation, expand the planting area, improve the varieties, and select suitable land, the future is also very promising. The cultivation of tobacco on the island has a long history, and excellent yellow varieties have long been imported. However, due to crude planting, there are no sufficient achievements. The various Japanese development companies also failed to select a suitable planting site, and security was not successful. Therefore, they ultimately did not achieve concrete results. However, experts all agree that it is a promising undertaking.</p>
<p>Foundation of Agriculture</p>
<p>The island's four seasons are warm, which is very suitable for the cultivation of tropical fruit trees. The northern part of the island has a period of only a little over a month when it is colder in winter, so it is also quite suitable for the development of subtropical and temperate fruit trees. The Yongxing City, which supplies Haikou with fruit all year round (located in northern Qiongyai, while Yaxian is the only major fruit-producing area in the south), is truly a rare fruit tree holy land in East Asia. Almost all kinds of tropical, subtropical, and temperate fruits are not produced on the island. Therefore, operating a fruit tree garden is the most profitable undertaking on the island. If we can seize the opportunity, it will not be difficult to become rich. The main fruit trees on the island include tangerines, bananas, waxberries, plums, peaches, grapes, plums, pomegranates, loquats, satsumas, star fruit, olives, lychees, longans, jackfruit, bananas, pineapples, sand pears, mangoes, etc., and there are no less than dozens of types. There are many flowers and the yield is abundant. The Japanese have also laid a good foundation for improving the varieties, introducing new varieties for trial planting, and preventing and controlling diseases and pests. With further research, the future is unlimited.</p>
<p>As for the forests of Hainan Island, there are still many primitive forests in the central mountains that have not been developed by the Japanese. In the future, if the political situation is stable and transportation is smooth, the island's forestry and timber industry will have a very bright future without a doubt.</p>
<p>Agricultural water conservancy is the foundation of agriculture. The Japanese recognized its importance and specially established a water conservancy department to actively engage in the investigation, design, and construction of water conservancy projects. The completed projects total 47, benefiting an area of 7,171 hectares. There are 16 uncompleted projects and 23 projects that have been planned but not yet started. All are expected to be completed in the next ten years. If successful, not only will the extremely serious food problem on the island be solved, but the increase in production of various crops will also be solved accordingly.</p>
<p>Agricultural product processing is the industrial processing of several products to make them suitable for utilization and increase their value. This includes rice milling, flour making, sugar making, oil extraction, brewing, and canning. Among the agricultural companies operated by the Japanese, processing enterprises advanced in parallel with crop cultivation. Otherwise, if agriculture only aims to supply raw materials, it is the primitive state of agriculture in ancient times. It is obvious that it does not conform to the trends of the times. But it is painful to say that the general public in our country is ignorant and does not realize that agricultural product processing or food processing belongs to the scope of industry and should be separated and differentiated from the entire agriculture. This led to the disintegration and irreparable damage to all the Hainan Island agricultural companies during this takeover, which is a great misfortune for the country.</p>
<p>After the victory in August last year, various departments of the central government sent personnel to Qiongyai to take over in sequence. Due to the poor distribution of the surrender and takeover agencies, the steps were disorganized and at a loss, compared to the Japanese, who, despite being defeated, handled the handover with clear items and in an orderly manner, so shame on us!</p>
<p>Precious Spoils of Victory</p>
<p>Qiongyai is a tropical agricultural resource land. Therefore, all development should start with agriculture and then gradually progress from agriculture to industry. This is the path that should be taken to develop industry. Therefore, the original agricultural companies operated by the Japanese are valuable spoils of victory on the island. If they can be used well, the industrial development of Hainan Island in 20 years will not be difficult to compete with today's Taiwan. Because Taiwan was as poor as Hainan Island is today when it was under our country's rule. However, after 50 years of operation by the Japanese, it has jumped to become the lifeline of Japan, thanks to the Japanese's vigorous efforts. What is regrettable is that the good foundation laid by the Japanese in Qiongyai was destroyed this time due to poor management, which is regrettable. The current plan is to clean up the mess and carry out rectification, dividing the nature to determine whether it is state-owned or private-owned. All of this will be effective in a good political environment. Therefore, the saying that the province will be established this spring was very reliable (it was once rumored that Zeng Yangfu would be appointed as the head of Qiongyai's administration). At that time, all people who cared about Hainan Island were happily looking forward to it, entrusting it with a ray of hope, hoping that the improvement of the political environment would enable the development of Hainan Island to get on track. Otherwise, as the situation is today, not only is the Guangdong Provincial Government unable to reach and powerless to intervene, but the various institutions on the island are also governing themselves, chaotic and disorganized, and security is not guaranteed, which makes people who are interested in going to Qiongyai to work hesitant, let alone development and construction.</p>
<p>This article is based on Mr. Chen's lecture on the 26th and his conversation with reporters on the 3rd. After the manuscript was completed, it was hurriedly mailed, and I am deeply sorry that Mr. Chen did not revise it again. If there are any errors, the reporter will bear the responsibility for the literature. Mr. Chen is truly a person with a heart. At the beginning of the victory, the authorities intended to invite Mr. Chen to take charge of forestry in Taiwan. However, Mr. Chen, with his scholar's true color and keen insight, avoided the easy and took on the difficult, rushing to Hainan Island, which most people had never visited, and shouldering heavy responsibilities. In the past year, although he was unable to display his talents due to the harsh objective environment, he was extremely discouraged. However, Mr. Chen has continued to write many systematic texts based on his observations. Most of them have been published in the East, and recently, I heard that he has written a book of hundreds of thousands of words, "Hainan Island Development Plan," the manuscript has been completed, and it will be published soon, showing that its early publication is a special highlight for the publishing industry. Mr. Chen will be the first person in our country to research Hainan Island and write systematically. This contribution is very precious. (December 8, 1946, in Nanjing)</p>

<h3 id="e203">Year-End Dark Clouds Press Down on Guilin <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Guilin 21st Air Dispatch from Our Correspondent in Guilin, Liang Xiaozhong</p>
<p>Another year easily passes; spring is gone, autumn is gone, and more than three hundred days have been lightly sent into the depths of memory. Some families rejoice, some suffer in confusion; it all looks like a cloud, a wisp of smoke! Those who see the world with coldness are often those who are treated coldly by the world. The quiet Guangxi, few people think about how to spend New Year's Day. In their eyes, they still need to eat!</p>
<p>Year-End Difficulties – Can't Muster Enthusiasm</p>
<p>The year-end cannot stir up enthusiasm in people's hearts, but the abacuses of government offices in Guilin City are clattering at a sky-high pace. Settling accounts and budgets have muddled the minds of impoverished officials. As soon as the provincial government opens its books, let alone next year, they don't even know how to manage this year-end. The money problem is very troublesome. It was only with great difficulty that the Provincial Chairman flew to Nanjing and borrowed 260 million to get through the year. In the blink of an eye, it is again a "lucky" New Year. The budget for the thirty-sixth year is still short. Therefore, in desperation, the cry for layoffs and reduced government is heard again. It is estimated that after the first day of the Lunar New Year, one out of five government officials eating outside Wen Chang Gate will disappear. The list of layoffs has not yet been announced, and the junior staff are as anxious as ants on a hot pot. Judging by their mood, it is even more awkward than when shop owners invite their employees to an "heartless meal" at the end of the year. Those who are laid off are laid off, with no placement or aftercare. Those with children and families must continue to support them. A family of eight is not a family of eight. The most tragic thing is that flesh and blood cannot be cut off, and they must still live. Please tell me, in the time from New Year's Eve to New Year's Day, in that moment of darkness and light, how many heavy sighs can you hear?</p>
<p>Grain Tax – Urge and Delay</p>
<p>Every year is difficult, but every year must be passed. Originally, the year-end and the end of the year are the total aggregation of hardship. Whoever can get through it can take a breath from under the heavy pressure, and then they have to calculate the great disaster of the coming year. Unfortunately, few people can get through the year-end, and many cannot. Looking at the end of the lunar month, one cannot help but think of the grain tax that must be paid by the end of the year. In recent days, the Grain Bureau has dispatched staff to various counties to urge payment, and the counties have also dispatched staff to various townships to urge payment. An ax, a handle, a thin slice, linked together constitute a tense picture. For the sake of administration, the government cannot be without rice. For the lack of rice, the farmers have forgotten the government's orders. Between urging and delaying, I vaguely remember hearing many of the most unpleasant stories. However, I don't want to write them; as soon as I write them down, it will be two lines of tears...</p>
<p>Rent Reduction – Superficial Implementation</p>
<p>What benefits do farmers get from reducing grain and rent? When Chairman Huang met with Chairman Chiang, Chairman Chiang instructed that the 25% rent reduction should be thoroughly implemented, but as soon as it was implemented, some counties reported "no landlords or tenant farmers at all." Some places even superficially implemented rent reduction, with landlords returning a portion of the rent grain to tenant farmers, but as soon as the supervisors left, the tenant farmers carried the grain back to the landlord's house, simply putting on a show!</p>
<p>The more painful things there are, the more absurd things there are. In the past two weeks, the Guilin market has always seen an unsuppressible resentment towards relief workers. From seeing refugees being driven away to the stinky rice brought in by the relief branch office, and then to the case of deducting disaster relief grain by the ounce per pound of stinky rice, sometimes emotions surge. When I see the bloated and greasy officials of the branch office acting hypocritically, I really want to run up to this group of scoundrels and slap them twice!</p>
<p>Difficulties – Filled with Indignation</p>
<p>The Guilin refugee shelter has more than a thousand refugees, who have been living a miserable life for five months. Not to mention that one-twelfth have died of illness and starvation, the relief branch office is also going to dissolve it at the end of the year, asking this group of white-haired people to "fend for themselves." Each person is given ninety catties of stinky rice in one go and must leave. The relief branch office tricked the refugees into signing a document, saying that it was a receipt for receiving rice. Who knew that when they opened it later, it was actually a deed of "willingly fending for themselves." For a time, the refugees were filled with unspeakable grief and indignation and appealed to all sectors of society. After all parties questioned the Guilin relief branch office, the refugees were sent to various relief centers for placement. Otherwise, there would have been another group of wronged souls who died miserably under the banner of "relief."</p>
<p>Stinky Rice – Refused to Accept</p>
<p>Since the relief branch office transported dozens of tons of stinky broken rice to Guilin and was rejected by the relevant authorities, the relief branch office sent a telegram stating: "Broken rice is better than tree bark and grass roots. If you refuse to accept it again, it will not be distributed." There is a great sense of "take it or leave it; if you don't want it, you won't even have broken rice." The Guilin office of the branch office publicly declared: "Fit for us to eat, we don't have time to care," which further aroused public outrage. Sacks of stinky rice were everywhere. The chairman of the Guilin City Council angrily cursed, "The relief branch office simply looks down on the common people; the relief branch office is not a benefactor, and the disaster victims are not beggars." However, let them laugh and curse as they please, the relief branch office is still shouting, "Come, eat!" If you don't come, you don't come. The gentlemen of the branch office won't starve to death. Alas, such relief truly fulfills a saying of the Buddhist family: "It cannot be said, it cannot be said!" How infuriating, how infuriating!</p>
<p>As the New Year approaches, I want to say something auspicious, but my chest is full of depression, which almost makes me forget that this is still a human world. Forcing myself to smile through a bitter face, I can't smile!</p>
<p>From the depths of my heart, I angrily shout, "God, may the final day of judgment come sooner!"</p>
<p>The Wonders of the Taitung Tianlong Bridge (Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun)</p>
<h3 id="e204">Travel to Taitung – Going to Hualien Port <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Taipei Air Dispatch, 18th Our Special Correspondent Chang Jiang Muyun</p>
<p>The East Taiwan Inspection Team left Taitung County on the afternoon of December 8th. On the eve of their departure, they held a special welcome meeting in the theater. This meeting was the first grand event in Taitung after the Retrocession because government personnel rarely came, and domestic and foreign inspection teams regarded the eastern part as a restricted area. They longed for the government's concern, just like they longed for the warm currents of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>At this meeting, we saw the smiling faces of thousands of people and thunderous cheers, which symbolized the voices from the bottom of the hearts of the people of East Taiwan! Director Ren announced the government's determination to develop East Taiwan in front of the public and also helped them solve the practical problems of long-awaited construction. We also saw the dances of the young men and women of the Gaoshan tribe. They welcomed the inspection team with the most enthusiastic emotions and the most genuine performances. This was not a simple dance. It had the original taste of nature, but it also had an artistic flavor, a sharp and harmonious four-part chorus, which made people forget that they were Gaoshan compatriots. The genius of music and dance is eagerly waiting for the discovery of dancers and musicians. They hope that Dai Ailian can come to this desolate city.</p>
<p>Taitung Line – Typhoon is the Greatest Threat</p>
<p>From Taitung to Hualien Port, there is a railway, with a total length of 177 kilometers. When the inspection team decided to depart, the three trains running daily, one of which was a VIP steam train, had been reserved for the exclusive use of the inspection team. We were very interested in having a more comfortable special train to enjoy during the long journey. This line was only about one hundred li long in the late Qing Dynasty, but now it is 175.9 kilometers long, with 39 stations under its jurisdiction.</p>
<p>According to the Railroad Committee's Chief Engineer Zhang Zhongsong, the biggest threat and the strongest destructive force to the Taitung Line is the typhoon. The entire line passes through 102 streams, the largest of which are about three. A very large amount is spent annually on maintenance and repair projects, which affects traffic. The fastest repairs also take two or three days. Therefore, in the strong wind season, transportation in eastern Taiwan is prone to being disrupted. However, the 1,300 employees fully demonstrate the power to overcome nature. Among these personnel, distributed at the stations along the line, more than 97% are local Taiwanese, and the stationmasters are all appointed by them. Recently, in order to maintain their livelihood, the Transportation Department had to slightly increase fares to subsidize them, but in fact, it is still difficult to balance revenue and expenditure. The current monthly income is 2.6 million New Taiwan Dollars, but the expenditure is more than 6 million. The government's painstaking efforts to maintain transportation are even more visible in the sparsely populated eastern part.</p>
<p>The car sped through the small stations at a speed of 60 yards, and the stationmasters and employees stood at attention to show their respect. When the car passed Zhutian in eastern Taiwan, it was raining, and the mountains were swallowed up by the low-pressure rain clouds. The wind blew from the streams and valleys through the desolate wilderness, through the sugarcane fields, and through the low wooden houses, and everyone felt the chill and had to put on a sweater!</p>
<p>Transportation Network – Eastern Taiwan's Income is Only 100,000</p>
<p>Xu Shangzhen, the general manager of the Transportation Company, sat next to the reporter. Whenever he mentioned transportation in Taitung, he said: The government knows that transportation on the Taitung Line will lose money, but it cannot be compared with merchants, who will not do it if they see a loss! The Transportation Company is actually an organization that undertakes joint freight transportation. As long as passengers and goods are handed over to it, it can be transported to the designated area. The handling fee is no more than ten yuan per ton, and if the loss exceeds the agreed amount, it must be compensated. The freight is paid by the company first, which can be said to be responsible for transportation.</p>
<p>The company has more than 3,000 employees, about 300 of whom are distributed in eastern Taiwan. From the perspective of transportation in the entire province, Taitung is actually a burden. The total monthly income is 20 million New Taiwan Dollars, but the eastern part, including Luodong and Yilan, is only 560,000 yuan; Taitung and Hualien Port are less than 100,000 yuan. In terms of transportation volume, in the most prosperous period before the war, the daily railway freight transportation was about 20,000 tons up and down. Before the Retrocession, it once dropped to more than 2,000 tons per day, but now it has increased to 8,000 to 9,000 tons. The eastern part has always maintained several thousand tons. From Taitung to Hualien Port, the main transportation is grain. In the past, when transportation from Suao to Hualien Port was cut off for three months, it completely relied on the Taitung No. 1 and sailing ships, which traveled at 9 knots per hour, which not only maintained freight transportation but also maintained passenger transportation. Then he happily said that at present, the income and expenditure of transportation in the eastern part can be kept in balance, and the round-the-island transportation network has been completed. In the future, if there is a regular airline to Taitung, the transportation of sugar, cement, salt, and food in the eastern part will be much smoother, and the price difference between the producing area and the actual selling area will not be too great due to the transportation by road trucks alone; the people of the eastern part can no longer bear the extra burden caused by transportation!</p>
<p>Round-the-Island Line – Construction Costs 200 Million</p>
<p>Taiwan is surrounded by the sea on all sides, with a coastline of 1,139.243 kilometers. The railway lines laid on the island, in the northern part and the Taixi Plain to the southern part, and the railways privately established by various production enterprises form a railway network. The East Taiwan Railway is built in the Taitung Plain between the Central Mountain Range and the Coastal Mountain Range, forming a round-the-island railway with the western line; because the central part is full of towering mountains, the central transverse railway and highway have not yet been established.</p>
<p>The Japanese originally built the Southern Transverse Highway from Pingtung to Zhiben in Taitung, with a total length of 137.4 kilometers; according to Director Fei, the Japanese once passed an engineering truck on this highway, but military vehicles never drove on it, and most of the roadbed was damaged. In terms of transportation in the entire province, this line has no significant meaning. The Japanese were mainly afraid of the Allied forces landing in the south, and this was a retreat route for them to escape. In fact, the highway around the southernmost tip is only a dozen kilometers longer in the total mileage, and it would be a loss to spend this huge sum of money to build a highway. There is also the Central Transverse Highway, from Taichung to Fuli via Puli for 41 kilometers, which is now open to traffic. From Fuli across the towering mountains to the eastern Tongmen for 70 kilometers, it still needs to be repaired, which is estimated to cost 90 million New Taiwan Dollars. At present, the Bureau has decided to repair the Tongmen suspension bridge first because the bridge deck was destroyed by strong winds, but the iron cables can still be used, so it needs to be repaired urgently and has been decided to be completed starting next year. If this central highway is opened up, passing through the Central Mountain Range to Taitung, there will be no need to detour to the southern or northern parts of the island.</p>
<p>In fact, the lifeline of transportation in the eastern part is completely tied to the rapid connection of the round-the-island railway. The Japanese used to build a railway from Luodong to the end of the Taiping Mountain railway in Tuchang, passing through Taiping Mountain, Nanhu Mountain, Central Jianshan, and entering the Sanzan north of Hualien Port on Qingshui Mountain. They had already spent a measurement fee for this mountain line, which is more than 100 kilometers away. According to Engineer Zhang's plan, the Japanese were prepared to spend 10 million yuan six years ago, but now it is two hundred times more, at 2 billion yuan, which is 1.18 billion yuan less than building the coastal line. It is estimated that after one year of measurement, the construction of a light railway line will be started first. Director Ren knows that this line is the lifeline of eastern Taiwan. Although he is not sure that he can decide on the engineering fee, which has a huge number, he is doing his best to encourage people who are familiar with the route to accompany Lin Zebi, the director of the Kaohsiung Port Bureau specially dispatched by the Transportation Department, to sell land for inspection. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he measured the Xudian Railway and believes that the preliminary investigation of this line can be successfully completed. Director Ren told reporters that the Public Works Department will start the construction of the Zhutian Railway this year. If the round-the-island railway can be completed, Chief Chen's reputation in Taiwan will last forever because he can complete the project that the Japanese could not complete in fifty years!</p>
<p>On the South Sea – Green Island and Orchid Island</p>
<p>In the eastern part, we looked out at the Pacific Ocean, and with binoculars, we could clearly see the cliffs of Green Island, which is 29 nautical miles away. Orchid Island is 70 nautical miles south of Taitung. These two isolated islands in the South Sea belong to Taitung County. Because the itinerary of the inspection team was decided, it was a pity that we could not conduct on-the-spot investigations.</p>
<p>Orchid Island is 38 li in circumference and is inhabited by 1,273 Yami people, which is an eight-hour sea voyage from Taitung. According to Section Chief Wang Yuren, the Meteorological Bureau sent staff to work on the island. When they arrived, it was raining heavily, and they were soaked all over. In a moment, the sky cleared, and the sun was shining brightly, and their clothes were all dried. Because it is windy here, the houses are very low. From a plane view, they are single-story houses, but in reality, they are three-story buildings like pits: the lower layer is earth, covered with thatch, for warmth in winter, the middle layer is used in spring and autumn, and the upper layer is suitable for summer.</p>

<h3 id="e205">The YVA in the Shanxi-Shaanxi Plateau – Hukou and Longmen <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Air Dispatch, 14th Our Xi'an Correspondent Li Chi</p>
<p>Water conservancy expert Dr. Savage and his party flew from Henan to Ningxia on the 13th. Few people know that he stopped over at the E County Airport, 40 kilometers southwest of Xi'an, for a moment and left the first footprint on the "Shanxi-Shaanxi Plateau." Recently, there have been fewer airmail flights. Perhaps by the time this dispatch arrives in Shanghai, his party has already flown back to Shaanxi, visited the achievements of water conservancy construction in the province, and surveyed many water sources with utilization value. The former includes the benefiting area of irrigation canals, and the latter mainly refers to the 65-kilometer Yellow River channel from Hukou to Longmen. Baoji Gorge, 15 kilometers east of Baoji, was also seen incidentally.</p>
<p>Two Points of Water Conservancy to be Proud Of</p>
<p>When talking about water conservancy, Shaanxi Province has two points to be proud of: first, it started early and has a long history; second, it is effective and improves every year. For example, the exquisite canals built in ancient times still exist today. Mr. Li Yizhi devoted his life to water conservancy in Shaanxi Province and eventually sacrificed his life. Fortunately, his "second generation" is continuing his work. At present, there are canals in the province with a length of up to 120 kilometers, irrigating more than 1.6 million mu of benefited cultivated land (mainly cotton and grain fields). In addition to these, there are also more than 3,000 horsepower of hydroelectric power, which are not well known, distributed in Nanzheng in southern Shaanxi and Mei County east of Baoji. However, Savage's trip was not for sightseeing; his greater task was to formulate a comprehensive plan for governing the Yellow River, including passively preventing "Yellow River disasters" and actively utilizing water power and dredging navigation. In other words, to simultaneously reduce disasters and increase benefits in a scissor-shaped manner.</p>
<p>From Hekou to Tongguan, the Yellow River is precisely the natural provincial boundary between Shanxi and Shaanxi. However, the 600-kilometer-long and one-kilometer-wide river is not convenient for navigation, and the Yellow River, which contains unlimited power, is allowed to cause floods everywhere downstream. Please take a closer look at the light blue ribbon representing the Yellow River on the map. When it reaches the area between Yichuan, Shaanxi, and Jixian, Shanxi, it narrows into a black line? This narrow mouth is Hukou, which is mentioned below. Further south, when it reaches the area between Hancheng, Shaanxi, and Hejin, Shanxi, that is, Longmen, which is mentioned below, it widens again and joins the Fenhe River mouth. Between Hukou and Longmen, the Yellow River channel narrows greatly. Although the rolling river water has the power to overturn mountains and seas, it can only surge in the narrow valleys, and the narrower the valley, the greater the water power. This section of the river channel has been mentioned in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings as being used as a hydroelectric power plant, "white coal," and is equally important as the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River and the Xijiang River in Guangdong. Unfortunately, it has still been "empty talk on paper" for decades. If it is successfully completed one day in the future, it will undoubtedly be the second "Yangtze Valley Authority" (YVA) between the Shanxi-Shaanxi Plateau. According to the most optimistic estimate, it can electrify the four provinces of Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, and Shandong and the "Longhai" and other three railways, irrigate 4 million mu of cultivated land, and partially open navigation along the line. There is also the most surprising function: as long as a reservoir dam with a height of only 150 meters is built at a suitable location in this section, 12 billion cubic meters of Yellow River water upstream can be stored without leaking a drop. Within half a century, there will be no flood disasters downstream!</p>
<p>What our water conservancy experts expect from Savage this time is to have him, based on various available and relevant data, plus on-the-spot surveys, provide his valuable opinions.</p>
<p>Hukou Narrow Stream and Rapid Waterfall</p>
<p>Hukou is 15 kilometers east and west of Yichuan County. When the Yellow River reaches this place, the 400-500 meter wide river channel gradually narrows to 200-300 meters. The steep slopes on both sides are not high, only more than 10 meters, but under the riverbed, there is a deep ditch that is one kilometer long, and its width and depth are both about 20-30 meters. The Yellow River water upstream flows to this place and all flows into this deep ditch, Hukou. The surging water is like fog, like a flying waterfall, and the roar is like thunder. It is indeed a spectacle! The ancients said that this place is "nine li and three fen deep," but after investigation, it is known to be an exaggeration. Every year from November to March of spring, the 600-700 meter wide waterfall is frozen like a chain. According to a foreigner's record in 1905, the ice pillars had not yet melted in May of that year. This scene reminds people of the ancient poem "Only now the day the ice melts on the riverbank, is the time when the flowers fall in Chang'an." After the ice melts, Hukou becomes a flying waterfall again, but this phenomenon does not occur during floods. Near the lower end of the deep ditch, there are two small stone islands protruding from the water surface for several meters, called "Mengmen." In the past, someone planned to use these small islands to build a reservoir dam.</p>
<p>What attracts attention to Hukou is this narrow stream and rapid waterfall, which may be used for hydroelectric power generation. According to a relatively old survey by the Geological Survey Institute (August 1932), Hukou has a flow of more than 8,000 cubic meters per second. According to another report, the water level difference at Hukou is about 20 meters. Mr. Li Huatian of the former Yellow River Conservancy Commission was the most optimistic in his estimate, believing that "building a 55-meter high dam at Hukou can generate 3 million horsepower." However, another extremely conservative estimate said that it only has 300,000 horsepower. In addition, many others have made different estimates. According to the latest resurvey by the "Yellow River Treatment Research Group" and the Shaanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau in October this year, their conclusion greatly revises the estimates of the predecessors. Among them, Mr. Guan Wenqi believes that "Hukou is purely named after a deep ditch at the bottom of the river. Although there may be a "drop" of several meters or dozens of meters underwater, tens of thousands of horsepower may be generated, but the deep ditch is narrow and cannot be utilized. Even if a method is found to draw water out of the channel, the downstream bearing point is deep under the riverbed, and construction management is absolutely difficult. Mengmen Island is too small to have any significance for a high dam. In summary, the geological conditions and river channel conditions are not sufficient to be a high dam site." The long freezing period of Hukou is also a shortcoming.</p>
<p>As of now, the opinions of experts such as Zhang Hanying, the head of the "Treatment Research Group," Liu Zhongrui, the director of the Shaanxi Water Conservancy Bureau, and Cao Ruizhi, the newly appointed director of the Shanxi Water Conservancy Bureau, have generally agreed that Hukou's value is not as good as Longmen's, which is described below.</p>
<p>Estimates for Dam Construction at Longmen</p>
<p>After the Yellow River passes Mengmen, it widens to 700-800 meters. When it reaches Shimen Gorge, the river narrows to about 100 meters, and the cliffs on both sides are also 100 meters high. Then it widens again at Sanlilang, and then narrows to a 60-meter narrow mouth at Longmen and Yumen Pass. Water conservancy experts are still fiercely discussing this section of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>According to the latest resurvey results, Mr. Guan Wenqi believes that both Shimen Gorge and Sanlilang have the conditions for building a reservoir dam, but he rejects Shimen Gorge. The "Treatment Research Group" also generally believes that the value near Shimen Gorge is the greatest. According to Guan's estimate, building a 150-meter-high reservoir dam can store 13 billion cubic meters of Yellow River water. Considering that the average annual flow of the Yellow River in the Longmen area is 400 cubic meters per second, only 12.6 billion cubic meters of Yellow River water will flow down throughout the year. After this dam is built, it can of course completely store the upstream water for use. However, whether there are loopholes under the geological formation remains to be verified.</p>
<p>According to historical records of the Yellow River hydrology, the largest flood was 18,000 cubic meters per second. Assuming that the flood lasts for two consecutive days, each upper 10 meters of the reservoir after this dam is built can accommodate a flood as large as the one mentioned above. By extension, there will be no flood disasters downstream for decades. The amount of sediment transported by the Yellow River near Yumen Pass is 2%, so it is estimated that this dam has a lifespan of 50 years.</p>
<p>If this reservoir is used to generate electricity, how much electricity will be generated? Because the numbers used by the experts are different, their conclusions also have great differences. Guan estimates that it can generate "350,000 horsepower, electrifying areas within 200 miles of Shanxi and Shaanxi, and irrigating 4 million mu of cultivated land." Cao Duanzhi believes that it can obtain 1.3 million horsepower, irrigate 20 million mu of cultivated land, and electrify the "Pinghan," "Tongpu," and "Longhai" railways, transmitting electricity as far as Ping, Tianjin, Tianshui, and Shandong. Another estimate by the "Yellow River Commission" is the smallest, only 300,000 horsepower.</p>
<p>However, we believe that after Mr. Savage and his party return from their inspection, they will immediately correct the above-mentioned disparate figures and obtain similar conclusions.</p>
<h3 id="e206">On Poetic Rhymes <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Lou</p>
<p>Many people doubt the old poetic rhymes. Naturally, they are things of the past, but they have their evolution, their history, and their function and value. The poetic rhymes we have commonly used for the last few hundred years were compiled by Wang Wenyu of PingShui during the Jin Dynasty, so they are commonly called the PingShui Rhymes. How did he come to have such authority? Because he had already combined the 206 rhyme groups of the Song Dynasty's Guangyun into 107 rhyme groups. For example, Guangyun is "one dong, two dong, three zhong, four jiang, five zhi, six zhi, seven zhi, eight wei," while PingShui is "one dong, two dong, three jiang, four zhi, five wei," which is much simpler. However, its principle still adheres to the old extended rhyme, and Guangyun is derived from Tang Sun Xu's Tangyun, and Tangyun is based on Sui Lu Yan's Qieyun. The Sui Dynasty was an era when southern culture moved north, reorganizing and dominating the Central Plains culture that had gradually collapsed under the influence of foreign customs after the Yongjia period. In terms of phonetics, it had to accommodate the characteristics of the Yellow River, Yangtze River, and Pearl River basins, encompassing all and not favoring one over the other. The book Qieyun was indeed a product of the times, capable of echoing politics and providing a tool for communication and integration between the north and south, Han and non-Han, which was by no means meaningless. Language is irrational; we can only adapt to language with rhyme books and cannot unify language with rhyme books. Although rhyme books are the universally recognized standard, there are many slightly remote places where they do not conform to actual pronunciation. Therefore, there is a joke about Hu Zeng in the Complete Tang Poems. Hu Zeng was from present-day Hunan, and he could not distinguish between "shi" (石) and "shi" (十), "yin" (陰) and "yin" (因). In the Tang Dynasty, everyone knew that these two words could not be pronounced the same way. Shi (石) was Shik, Shi (十) was Shit, Yin (陰) was Yim, and Yin (因) was Yin. Today, Cantonese speakers still distinguish them very clearly. It is likely that at that time, the pronunciation based on the rhyme book was quite similar to modern Mandarin—Putonghua—and it was acceptable for reading, writing, and general social communication.</p>
<p>Looking at how detailed the Tangyun division is, it is evident that it was not done rashly, but rather a great deal of effort was spent on compromise and analysis to achieve this. Although the standard was detailed, it was not very strict when used in rhyming prose. As long as it was not wrong in principle, even with the strictness of rhythmic prose and regulated verse, it could still be flexible. In practice, they did not feel too restricted.</p>
<p>Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty once compiled the Hongwu Zheng Yun, wanting to correct many pronunciations that seemed incompatible with the times to make them more practical. However, it failed, and the PingShui Rhymes continued to be used without change. What is the reason why Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty, who was so fond of being clever and dissatisfied with the status quo, could not succeed in reforming the rhyme book? At that time, a better standard could not be found. It is not possible to arbitrarily change things based on subjective opinions. If you find it easy to pronounce, you cannot ignore whether others find it easy to pronounce. How can that be? Moreover, the sound of a word is also related to its form. Any changes would have too many repercussions.</p>
<p>Indeed, in fact, the people of the Song Dynasty already did not abide by the old rhymes when writing lyrics, and there were so-called lyric rhymes. However, the habit of Song people writing lyrics was just to avoid being constrained by rhymes and only taking a general approximation. When reading or singing, they probably had to slightly change the original sound. Otherwise, how could words from the Zhi, Wei, and Qi rhyme groups be pronounced smoothly together? Also, if people from Fujian during the Song Dynasty used "He" (何) to rhyme with "Gao" (高) and "Lao" (老) and "Suo" (鎖) together when writing prose and lyrics, we would have to learn to speak with a Fujian accent to pronounce them.</p>
<p>While rhyme books are originally made to accommodate language, the pronunciation of rhyming prose should probably also slightly accommodate the rhyme book.</p>
<p>The division of the PingShui Rhymes is very scientific. Explained with Roman letters, it is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Dong ong Dong jing Jiang ong Zhi i Wei ei Yu iu Yu</p>
<p>ou Qi Jia Hui ai Zhen in Wen en Yuan eun Han oen Shan an</p>
<p>Xian ien Xiao Hao iao Hao ao Ge o Ma a Yang ang Geng eng</p>
<p>Qing ing Zheng êng You iou Qin im Tan am Yan iem Xian iam</p>
<p>The above are level tones. The rising, departing, and entering tones follow this pattern.</p>
<p>The entering tone rhymes are divided into three parts: (1) ending in k, (2) ending in t, (3) ending in p. Cantonese is completely the same as this.</p>
<p>Being able to understand the principles of rhyme division is beneficial for understanding dialects from various places. As a Chinese person, one should always understand several important dialects. Therefore, rhymes should also be understood. For example, knowing that the words of the Qi rhyme group are pronounced with the ai vowel in ancient sounds and in the Ao language, we know that the Cantonese "wife" is tsai, "title" is tai, and "chicken" is gai. Knowing that the Han rhyme group is oen and the Shan rhyme group is an, we know that in Wu dialect, "official" and "pass," "finish" and "ring," and "dry" and "idle" are not pronounced the same.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Avoiding Vulgarity <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>Western painting emphasizes beauty, while Chinese painting emphasizes elegance. The opposite of beauty is ugliness, and the opposite of elegance is vulgarity. If vulgarity is not removed, elegance cannot come. Painting flaws can all be cured, but only vulgarity cannot be cured. Those who are accustomed to vulgarity can be cured, but those who are born vulgar cannot be cured. Shen Xiyuan discussed avoiding vulgarity, saying:</p>
<p>"Vulgarity in painting can be roughly divided into five types: those who neither like to imitate ancient masters nor can create their own unique ideas, simply laying out things in a straightforward and monotonous manner, are called vulgar in style. Those who purely use ink washes, only showing patches of white and black, without any trace of brushwork, are called vulgar in rhythm. Those whose style is no different from others, but whose brushwork is stagnant and whose ink is dull, are called vulgar in spirit. Those who cling to the instruction of vulgar teachers, do not understand the ancient way of using the brush, or whose brushstrokes are dry like a bowstring, or whose brushstrokes are stiff like a brush, originally mediocre and unremarkable, but deliberately trying to be unconventional to shock the world, or arbitrarily creating sharp edges and corners, deliberately affecting a posed manner, are called vulgar in brushwork. Those who do not take subjects from ancient famous sages' deeds and elegant themes, but only take flattering praise of prosperity and all matters that are not suitable for poetry, are called vulgar in subject matter. -- Only by removing these five vulgarities can one approach elegance." -- Compilation of Learning to Paint from Mustard Seed Garden</p>
<p>In addition to the stylistic vulgarity, rhythmic vulgarity, spiritual vulgarity, brushwork vulgarity, and subject matter vulgarity discussed by Shen, there are many other types of vulgarity. Roughly speaking, there are still the following twelve types:</p>
<p>Crude vulgarity -- Crude brushstrokes and large leaves, arbitrarily smearing, only seeking to connect things, without any rules. Those who study Xu Tianchi, Bada Shanren, and Wu Changshuo often commit this fault.</p>
<p>Wild vulgarity -- Drawing swords and stringing bows, colors and ink running rampant, only seeking pleasure, without any restraint. Those who study the Zhe School often commit this fault.</p>
<p>Rigid vulgarity -- Exposing sinews and bones, with many angles and few curves, only seeking strength, without any gentleness. Those who study Shen Shitian and Lan Tianshu often commit this fault.</p>
<p>Soft vulgarity -- Weak brushstrokes, depicting heads and drawing feet, only seeking softness, without any boldness. Those who study Hua Xinluo and Mei Qushan often commit this fault.</p>
<p>Flattering vulgarity -- Delicate and charming, coquettish, only seeking elegance, lacking vigor. Those who study Yun Nantian often commit this fault.</p>
<p>Inky vulgarity -- Ink washes and halos, misty and distant, only seeing ink color, not seeing brushwork. Those who study Mi Nangong often commit this fault. The vulgarity of the modern Wu Naixian is particularly evident.</p>
<p>Colorful vulgarity -- Red and green mixed together, resplendent with gold and jade, only seeking beauty, with very little clarity. Those who study blue-green landscapes and meticulous flower-and-bird paintings often commit this fault.</p>
<p>Draft vulgarity -- Lacking hills and valleys in the chest, without changes in the brush, copying the past and changing the order, almost like a printing plate. Those who study Wang Luntai often commit this fault. The modern Wu Daiqiu was also unable to avoid it.</p>
<p>Strange vulgarity -- Coming from outside the sky, creating independently, the strangeness is not reasonable, the weirdness is close to absurdity. Those who study Shi Tao and Bada often commit this fault.</p>
<p>Clumsy vulgarity -- Broken and fragmented, ancient and clumsy, striving for stiffness, without any fluency. Those who study Jin Dongxin often commit this fault.</p>
<p>Heavy vulgarity -- Accumulating brushstrokes and ink, striving for thickness, the whole picture is dark, with no distinction between light and shade. Those who study Gong Banqian often commit this fault.</p>
<p>Comprehensive vulgarity -- Seeking perfection and completeness, everything that should be there is there, objects are mixed together, like a department store, embellishing scenes and offering blessings, fulfilling every request. Those who sell paintings in Shanghai often commit this fault.</p>
<p>Those who create it boast of their unique discovery, and those who admire it fall into habit. Once a painting falls into habit, there is no one who is not vulgar, because it only has the appearance of a certain school but not the spirit of that school. The above-mentioned masters were never vulgar, but those who study them fall into vulgarity.</p>

<p>— Lü Bansi</p>
<p>Rubens (1577-1640) was a representative writer of the Flemish School. His style is extremely realistic, and his colors are like gold, both seductive and sweet. In his later years, many students followed him. He was good at large-scale compositions. His output was even more astonishing. According to historians' estimates, Rubens's works, from the moment he was born until the moment he was buried, in the short 63 years, even if he didn't sleep or eat and painted non-stop, he still couldn't have painted so much. It was later proved that many paintings were helped by his students, and he only made revisions. But this portrait is an exception, because it was painted by him in his youth for his newly married wife. ( )</p>
<h3 id="e209">The Purple Skirt <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Cao</p>
<p>One morning, in a misty drizzle, the road was very slippery. A twelve- or thirteen-year-old boy stood in the middle of a bridge over the Suzhou Creek, his face delicate and handsome, his figure thin and weak, alone, looking up at the clouds in the mist: barefoot, wearing a purple skirt.</p>
<p>As I approached him, he turned his face, revealing a flawless smile, pure, without any desire or intention to exploit anything, looking at me indifferently.</p>
<p>He had a pair of beautiful eyes, round and large and luminous, filled with wisdom and joy, as if he didn't understand what sorrow and sadness were!</p>
<p>Except for his face, his ears, neck, legs, hands, and feet seemed unwashed for years, black, covered with a layer of dirt. His nails were long, growing on the tips of his thin fingers. His hair was not very long, nor too messy, just quite dirty on top; raindrops were like dewdrops pinned to the dirty areas.</p>
<p>That skirt was outstanding, the only thing on him that was the cleanest. He wore a black shirt on top, and over it, a worn-out gray cotton velvet vest.</p>
<p>In the evening, I saw him standing on the other side of the bridge.</p>
<p>Three days later, we seemed a bit familiar. When I passed by him again, he suddenly greeted me with a smile, nonchalantly saying to me:</p>
<p>"Give me two hundred yuan!"</p>
<p>I gave him a five-hundred-yuan bill instead. He took it and ran away quickly. His shadow disappeared into the crowd. From his tone and that strong energy, he was probably a boy!</p>
<p>I didn't see him for two days.</p>
<p>On the third day, he appeared again; he no longer stood there, but ran back and forth quickly from this side to the other side of the bridge. He seemed to have joined a gang and was rushing to push rickshaws across the bridge. I was glad for him in my heart that he finally had a job.</p>
<p>He had his hair cut, and his skirt was washed exceptionally purple, much cleaner than before; he lived happily, had not yet learned to worry, in his pure little heart.</p>
<p>Once, he pushed a rickshaw across the bridge, and the passenger didn't have much change, only giving him forty yuan. He happily accepted it; a larger child next to him reached out and snatched the money, slapping it on his face and cursing:</p>
<p>"Useless, forty yuan is enough for you to do!"</p>
<p>"If you don't want it, I'll take it!" he dodged, mumbling with a smile, picking up the bills one by one. Meeting me face to face, he showed a familiar smile, running to the other end of the bridge in a puff of smoke.</p>
<p>It was getting cold. Because of poor diet, I suffered from severe malaria for almost ten days; in my illness, I missed this child in the purple skirt; I decided to talk to him after I recovered, and ask about his background; this child was too lovable!</p>
<p>After eating breakfast, I walked towards that bridge. On the way, outside the threshold of a closed warehouse, a group of people huddled together, looking down at the ground with worried faces.</p>
<p>"Froze to death last night, was still alive yesterday..." someone said.</p>
<p>Looking through the cracks in the crowd, I saw a small corpse lying there, covered with some tattered cotton batting on the upper body, a smile still hanging on the face, and a purple skirt covering the stiff legs.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Small Scenes on the River <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Wei</p>
<p>I. Sandstone</p>
<p>When the river water recedes, the dark brown sandstone, like a group of dragons, slowly raises its spine, exposing it to the sun. Why not hibernate? Could it be waiting for another ice age? The dark brown sandstone is also like the bulbs of daffodils, buried firmly by the white sandy beach, and shallowly moistened by the emerald green river water. How long before it is the season for them to sprout? How long before they all burst open at the same time, opening up a river full of flowers, as brilliant as brocade; a single flower like a canopy, propping up the boatmen to rest, giving those hurried boats a place to anchor in the shade?</p>
<p>When the river water recedes, the dark brown sandstone is only silently lingered on by the eternal birds.</p>
<p>II. Pebbles</p>
<p>Countless pebbles gleam in the morning sun. Who was it that caught the countless stars in the Milky Way last night and poured them onto this emerald green river? Or are the stars merely the dim shadows of the pebbles? The pebbles are at the mercy of the capricious river, which sighs mournfully at them day and night in winter; but in spring and summer, it tramples on them as it rushes, races, and roars out thunderous torrents. As a result, they have completely lost their sharp edges and corners, but the essence of the pebbles is still generally hard; although powerless to prevent so much crushing and stripping, time will ultimately prove that it is only the outer form that is affected.</p>
<p>Travelers on the river, shining in the morning sun, may you also have an essence that can contend with time!</p>

<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Bored on the plane, everyone was reading newspapers by the light to relieve boredom. When everyone discovered this short note, they all seemed to have been injected with a stimulant, and suddenly became active, but because the plane was roaring, it was inconvenient to talk, so they could only point at the newspaper and make gestures to each other; some circled the short note with a pen and passed it around for everyone to see, and some were even more nosy, simply tearing down the short note and taking down the message board installed on the plane, which had ready-made paper clips and blank pages, clipping the short note on it, writing their own opinions on the blank pages, and circulating them among each other. One reckless fellow, with a bit of schadenfreude, collected the newspapers and message boards and handed them to Tsurumi in a pile. After Tsurumi read the short note, he carefully discussed the opinions on the message boards, one by one.</p>
<p>"If I were a samurai disciple, I would rather give up my life and parachute down to Befu to compete with those challengers." Someone wrote this.</p>
<p>"No, if the other party dares to challenge, they must be masters in the 'way'. If we fight, I'm afraid we won't be confident!" ... Another person wrote this.</p>
<p>"That's not right, I don't think victory or defeat matters. Stepping forward is a brave expression of the samurai way—in any case, it's much more noble than the cowardly act of running away" ...</p>
<p>"I think people who challenge like this are unreasonable; people become officials by using their skills, regardless of what kind of skills they are. Even if they win the battle, the official is still an official, and the superior won't necessarily demote him or discuss it. However, the victor won't necessarily get an official position, haha, baka..."</p>
<p>Tsurumi, thanks to the reckless fellow's kindness, showed him these wonderful articles, and at that time expressed his gratitude for his attention. He remained silently sitting there, ignoring the actions of those fools. He lowered his head and pondered for only a few minutes, then suddenly took out his notebook and the mechanical pencil that had been inspected by the secretary in Befu, quickly wrote two lines, and pressed the button next to him. The flight attendant came, and Tsurumi tore off the note he had written and handed it to the flight attendant, deliberately saying loudly the two words "urgent telegram". The flight attendant took the note and left in response.</p>
<p>The other fellows on the trip, seeing Tsurumi's action, of course caused another commotion, and of course there were many speculations, simply regarding this matter as more concerning than their own victory in battle or promotion in rank. Yet who knew that all of this was part of Tsurumi's plan to search for the "Seven Secret Letters" tonight!</p>
<p>What did Tsurumi write on that "urgent telegram"?</p>
<p>"To the Director of the Telecommunications Department of the General Staff Headquarters, I happened to read the extra edition of tonight's second battle news on the plane, and learned that a small number of unruly people have demonstrated and challenged me, a meaningless action, which is not worth bothering about. However, the fact that the bandits designated Prime Minister Jun's Befu may be a ruse, with other dangerous intentions. I beg you to be vigilant and relay this to the special forces on duty. I am on urgent official business and unable to deal with these petty people, which seems to lack courage, but in fact, I also do not intend to act impulsively, neglecting official duties because of private fights. However, I am extremely apprehensive that this has alarmed Prime Minister Jun. I humbly request that this be conveyed to all news agencies and relevant parties. Tsurumi Yu".</p>
<p>At this time, the plane had been flying for more than twenty minutes since it took off from Tokyo, heading towards the Kobe-Nagasaki route, and had flown quite a distance. While the people in the seats were still enthusiastically using the message boards to express their opinions, they suddenly felt a special vibration in the plane, as if it was circling. Just as everyone was surprised, they saw the co-pilot come out of the small door at the front of the plane, looking nervous, holding a piece of paper in his hand, like a telegraph form, waving it at the public, and handing it to the person in the first row of seats; meaning to let everyone pass it around.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Wall <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Shuo</p>
<p>In our ancient history, there is only the story of Youchao氏 (the Nest Builder) inventing "constructing wood for dwellings," but there is no mention of the origin of walls. In ancient times, when people ended their primitive life in the mountains and fields and built warm "nests" with thin pieces of wood, they were initially satisfied and happy. However, when a rainstorm came, followed by a flood, the wooden nests turned into floating boats, and they complained about the incompetence of Youchao氏, the inventor.</p>
<p>After all, humans are the most intelligent animals. They finally conquered nature with wisdom and overcame the obstacles of life. Since some unknown era, they invented walls. From then on, human life took another step towards civilization. They used gray-brown bricks to glue white clay, building high cliff-like walls around themselves. As a result, people were no longer afraid of floods. Their lives were like a pile of winding tree roots. They burrowed into the wall holes and lived on the soil. The days passed more and more stably and securely.</p>
<p>Walls brought people warmth and tranquility. Within the walls, people lived generation after generation. They built the walls into various shapes and painted them with bizarre and beautiful colors. Relying on the protection of the walls, they resisted a series of stormy days in the distant years, from ancestors to young children.</p>
<p>Like a spark on the prairie, whether in the misty morning or the dark dusk, walls were secretly, densely built for millions of people on this boundless wilderness. One wall surrounded another, one row connected to another, like long castles, like continuous mountain peaks...</p>
<p>From that time on, the prairie was no longer as lonely as a desert. Countless people, for their own selfish desires, raised millions of arms in every corner of the earth, building walls, and then energetically repairing them next to the rubble for its collapse. The coarse voice roared like a wild horse! The exchange of sweat, the gathering of strength, towns were built by people, and the towering walls of cities also appeared. On every side of the wall, along the cracks, there was boiling noise, greedy laughter, absurd delirium, the barking of wolves and dogs, and somber groans...</p>
<p>Perhaps human intelligence is precisely foolishness. What is often exchanged for the joyful desire is tragic despair! When the first solid wall like a mountain cliff stood on the soil, the inventor may have been excited to the point of trembling. A hideous-like smile was affixed at the corner of the mouth. This was a success in conquering nature, and the people of the earth would follow his masterpiece in every corner of the earth. They would universally build walls. Their heads would no longer be battered by wind and rain, and their bodies would no longer be cold. From then on, they could have a place of rest.</p>
<p>But the inventor did not expect that humans, having walls, would be cut off from everything like impregnable trenches. Those who imitated the building of walls did not even think that in order to find warmth, they were building fences around themselves, disliking the old life and fearing the blowing of wind and rain, but as a result lived more miserably. People were separated from each other. The walls cut them open and locked them tightly, like countless prisoners, people had no freedom!</p>
<p>Walls cruelly separated everything, tearing apart the friendship between people...</p>
<p>Humans are ultimately selfish. Among them, in order to seek their own happiness from the side of the wall, they constantly rehearsed ghostly skills and struggles. They repeatedly exposed the primitive bestiality, forgetting that they were all of the same kind, forgetting "humanity"!</p>
<p>With the evolution of the times, the walls increased year by year, blocking people's eyes, becoming a dark, vast expanse.</p>
<p>Just like that, since some unknown time until now, the walls have relentlessly shrouded people with a thick sorrow, like the fog of high mountains that forever congeals there.</p>
<p>But no one, like a human, bravely conducts a "trial", raising his fist to attack any wall!...</p>

<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>When we read the reports about the three passenger planes from the two Chinese Central Companies that encountered accidents on the same day, we felt both grief and indignation! We grieved over the tragedy of the disaster; and we were indignant. Why couldn't the blind landing equipment at Jiangwan Airport establish contact? And why didn't Tan Hwa Airport have this kind of equipment?</p>
<p>The two airplanes of the China National Aviation Corporation circled over Shanghai for three hours and thirty minutes. Please, readers, close your eyes and imagine what kind of psychological state the people in the plane were in at that time. Who doesn't seek to live? This life-or-death struggle, can there be anything more tragic in the world? And the Central Aviation Corporation's plane, forced to land and crash in Jiangwan Zhangjiazhai, was similarly forced to the final juncture, forced to do so.</p>
<p>We know that the airports of the China and Central Aviation Companies are in Longhua, and the reason why the planes flocked to Jiangwan was because there was blind landing equipment there. However, that was a military airport, and it was managed by the US military. The lack of usual contact was to be expected, and this time, the planes successively sought help from Jiangwan Airport, but only one of the China planes escaped danger. Whether there are other circumstances in this deserves our exploration. Since Longhua is the main airport of the two companies, why doesn't it have this equipment? Here, we cannot help but feel indignant for the victims!</p>
<p>What is gone is gone, what is to come can be pursued. We now have reason and even the right to request that the airline companies strengthen their equipment and must achieve 100% safety, otherwise, if the Chinese people's long-held idea that "flying is dangerous" is not broken, it will only become heavier, and the future of China's aviation industry is truly unimaginable.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Last Year, This Year, Next Year <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Fan</p>
<p>Like Chickens and Dogs in Turmoil</p>
<p>It is said that last year was the Year of the Rooster. The rooster crows at dawn, so the sky brightened, and everyone was happy. However, this year is the Year of the Dog. When the Year of the Rooster and the Year of the Dog are linked together, it becomes "like chickens and dogs in turmoil." Therefore, "requisitioning" is in the front, "malfeasance" is in the back, bullets fly, and prices jump wildly, a complete mess, dark and chaotic. What about next year? We shall wait and see!</p>
<p>A Comparison with Last Year</p>
<p>At the end of last year, the price of gold was 80,000 yuan, and the price of US dollars was 1,400 yuan. In one year, the price increased by more than four times but less than five times.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, the price of rice was 7,000 yuan, and at the end of this year, the price of rice is 70,000 yuan, an increase of ten times!</p>
<p>At the end of last year, when taking the tram, regardless of the length of the route or the class (first, second, or third), the fare was a uniform 5 yuan in legal tender. Now, the highest fare has reached 400 yuan, an increase of eighty times!</p>
<p>The price of a Smart shirt at the end of last year could buy a dozen; however, the money used to buy a Smart shirt last year can only buy a towel today.</p>
<p>The Popularity of US Dollars</p>
<p>At this time last year, there were many types of banknotes: legal tender, "Central Reserve Notes," and gold certificates. Counting the banknotes was not easy. This year, wealthy people are not interested in this; their minds have already turned to "US dollars"!</p>
<p>The Price of Brains Has Increased</p>
<p>A haircut costs 3,000 yuan in legal tender. Last year, this amount was equivalent to 600,000 yuan in "Central Reserve Notes," which had been forcibly exchanged for 1.2 million yuan in legal tender. So, doesn't that mean a haircut now costs a total of 1.2 million yuan in legal tender?</p>

<p>Seeing off the old and welcoming the new is a long story, but to put it directly: The Republic of China, starting from the 36th year (1947), should start everything anew!</p>

<p>— Qian</p>
<p>In Chinese and foreign history, we can find many unheard-of tax names. Now, let's list a few to join in the fun in this "world of taxes."</p>
<p>"Beard Tax": This is a great deed of Peter the Great of Russia. Due to his aversion, he stipulated that anyone who did not cut their beard had to pay a tax. It was not abolished until the time of Empress Catherine.</p>
<p>"Piano Tax": Italy once levied this tax. Each piano was subject to a tax of 50 lire. There was also a billiards tax, with the highest amount exceeding 250 lire.</p>
<p>"Hearth Tax": England levied a hearth tax between 1662 and 1689, charging two shillings per hearth.</p>
<p>"Window Tax": England levied a window tax between 1698 and 1851. Tax collectors would pass by the door of each house and count the number of windows to determine the tax payable.</p>
<p>"Funeral Tax": Practiced in Romania, the highest amount was 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>"Title Tax": Spain's "Good Tax" was levied specifically on people with titles. A nobleman had to pay thousands of yuan in tax each year.</p>
<p>"Head Tax": Prevalent in Southeast Asia, mostly levied by colonial authorities on indigenous people, and overseas Chinese were also not exempt.</p>

<h3 id="e217">The Organization of Beggars 21 Performing Arts Begging (Part 2) <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jiatan</p>
<p>(Thirteen) "Opening the Great Gate" - Among the cruelest tricks of the beggar gang to solicit alms, the "Opening the Great Gate" gang is the most brutal. All the dangerous acts of drawing blood by cutting the skin are classified into this category. This gang is further divided into three factions: "Red Bar," "Mine Sit," and "Needle Piercing." "Red Bar" involves inserting a barber's razor into the forehead, penetrating the flesh by about an inch. Fresh pig's blood is applied to make it look naturally ferocious and terrifying. "Mine Sit" involves knocking on the stone floor, hitting the forehead until it breaks and bleeds, shocking passersby and inducing them to give money. "Needle Piercing" involves inserting a long steel needle into the arm to show people. This type of "Opening the Great Gate" beggar believes that Lord Guan (Guan Yu) is their ancestor. This is probably because Guan Gong could ask Hua Tuo to cut his arm to heal his wound without changing his expression, which is enough to command respect. Therefore, every time they go out, they must first burn incense at the Guan Emperor Temple, which the gang calls "Worshipping the Master."</p>
<p>(Fourteen) "Fast and Slow Run" - Those low-level beggars who have no skills to sell have no choice but to beg from door to door, begging with a miserable expression. They are the lowest level of the beggar gang. Their behavior is divided into two types: "Fast Walk" and "Slow Walk." The "Fast Walk" gang comes to the door, limited to saying "Begging for something." If the shopkeeper gives them money, they take it and leave. If they don't give it, they run away to the next house. This gang adopts the principle of "every inch of time is precious" and never wastes time. The "Slow Walk" gang stands firmly in front of the shop door like a dull bird. They will never leave unless they are given money to send them away. When shopkeepers encounter this type of "long-term resistance," if they stubbornly refuse to give money, the beggar will stand still forever. If they are given money after a long time, they must give more. Because the beggar believes that the time wasted must be compensated by the shopkeeper.</p>
<p>(Fifteen) "Fake Childbirth" - In the beggar gang, in addition to the male beggars' efforts to get money, the female beggars in their families are not willing to sit idle. Whenever there is an opportunity, they launch an offensive on the streets. The most common is to perform a live drama of giving birth on the street. Before the performance, the beggar woman must first smear pig's blood on the straw and clothes and lie down outside the alleyway door in the early morning, holding a bloody newborn baby in her arms, immediately attracting passersby nearby. The beggar woman pretends to be a newly delivered mother with moans. At this time, the nearby ladies come to hear the news, and everyone is moved by sympathy and donates money. People in the gang call it "Crossing Blood." However, to perform this live drama, a fresh, live child is needed, a real baby who has just been born. It can be performed continuously three or several times in different locations. After three or four days after giving birth, the flaws will be seen by people, and it cannot be done anymore.</p>
<p>(Sixteen) "Fake Monks" - Beggars pretend to be monks, wearing monk robes, carrying Bodhisattvas, and soliciting incense money from door to door. This type of imposter is the most burdensome to the Buddhist community. However, the devout old ladies who generally believe in Buddhism are eager to donate and do not want to investigate their origins. Isn't this what is meant by hiding evil and encouraging theft?</p>
<p>(Seventeen) "Hands as Feet" - Disabled beggars whose feet are not good at walking have no choice but to use their hands as feet, holding two local pads in their hands to walk and beg. However, there are few genuine ones and many imposters. It is really a mixture of reality and falsehood, and there is no way to investigate!</p>
<p>(Eighteen) "Walking Double Knocks" - Beggars beat drums along the way to beg, hitting the drum with three sticks, imitating the flower drum tune, or singing the Shunliu Taoist tune. The end of the lunar year and the beginning of the new year are especially auspicious days for this type of activity. There are many ways to beg, but they do not deviate from the old practice of hitting the drum with three sticks. The Tai Gang is the rear guard of the eighteen classical dramas.</p>

<h3 id="e220">Also Talking About Polyphonic Characters <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>The need to reform square Chinese characters is beyond dispute. The question is how to reform, that is, what kind of new style of writing to use as a substitute. In the past half-century, we have seen our predecessors exhaust all kinds of methods, including imitating Japanese "kana," phonetic characters, simplified characters, basic Chinese characters, phonetic symbols, National Romanization, Latinized New Writing, ... up to recently when someone used polyphonic characters like "　". But I believe that all attempts to preserve the square shape of square characters, no matter how the plan is, will inevitably fail in the end.</p>
<p>If the above premise is correct, then today's rehash of creating polyphonic characters is not an "attempt" but a reproduction of failure and a waste of energy.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people will counter-argue with Zao Dingyou's creation of the "囗" shape with a "書" character inside, not missing a single stroke, as a polyphonic character for "library." But I would also like to present evidence that more than ten years ago, when Mr. Du published a booklet soliciting opinions from all parties on combining the three characters "圖書館" into one character, this booklet also advocated that words such as "博牧院" (museum) and "美術館" (art gallery) should also create "polyphonic characters," just like reducing "圖書館" into one "書" character placed in a "four-sided" frame.</p>
<p>This proposal was put forward, but for more than ten years, I have never seen a second "polyphonic character" in a second place.</p>
<p>On the contrary, I only remember that the entrance of the National Sun Yat-sen University Library, where Mr. Du was the director, still used the three characters "圖書館." Someone also proposed that names with two or three characters might as well be combined into a single square character, but in the books published by Du Dingyou in the past two years, he still wrote "杜定友" three characters neatly, without missing a stroke.</p>
<p>Oracle bone script, bronze inscriptions, Wei stele inscriptions, ... you can write them into scrolls and enjoy them alone in the room; but proposing to use oracle bone script to publish daily newspapers is nothing short of madness.</p>
<p>You can freely call a circle containing a triangle any kind of brand as a trademark, and no one has the right to interfere. But you must find a way to match this graphic pattern with a pronunciation, and use it as a single character to represent "an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle" in a plane geometry book, which is a thankless task. Such things can be used as a kind of advertising method, but truly thinking of it as a method of reforming Chinese characters is a bit too much.</p>
<p>Just think: "Gold Does Not Exchange," "Purple Chicken Wolf Hair," "White Whole Hair," "Small Red Tip"... if each of these thousands of types of writing brushes were to "equally" start with a "compound character," what kind of world would it be! How much space would the typesetting plate increase!</p>
<p>Evolving from pictographic characters to phonetic writing is an irresistible trend. Although phonetic symbols have been "crawling like a turtle" (Li Jinxi's words) for more than twenty years, don't be afraid; even if National Romanization has not been widely promoted to this day, there is no need to be discouraged. "Time" will definitely help Chinese characters develop in this direction.</p>
<p>The "Latinized New Writing" movement seven to ten years ago was, in principle, not much different from the simple National Romanization that my father taught me when I was a student. However, since the beginning of the "New Writing Movement," some people have used it as a tool for political struggle, so it was misunderstood by the authorities as being more harmful than "floods and fierce beasts." If that kind of simple phonetic writing had not merged with another political movement, as long as it was allowed to develop naturally, I think: today no one would regard "building a house on top of a bed" as a way to reform Chinese characters.</p>
<p>Even if it is a "road," I am afraid it is a "dead end"!</p>
<p>Weekend Teatime</p>
<p>— Liu Sui</p>
<p>Blessing the New Year</p>
<p>Today is the last weekend of this year. Having experienced fifty-two weekends over the past year, we seem to have crossed a long and difficult rapid. Before leaving these remaining pages of the years that we have trampled on, there are really too many feelings: the country is not peaceful, people's livelihood is like thorns, the "collapse wind" is everywhere, and the "rising wind" is raging; the requisitioning and investigation are just like a river of spring water, which has already flowed eastward, and the distribution of materials can be considered as sending charcoal in the snow, but it has not given us the warmth we expected. Past events are like smoke, and these fragmented regrets will all become relics. The Bible says: "Let the ugly sins go away! Light is about to come." On Christmas Day, we silently recite this chapter, and there are endless fantasies in our hearts. As the saying goes, "It is no use regretting the past; the future can be pursued." In fact, I have already argued too much about the past, but it seems that this has not had any significant effect. In addition to resentment, we can only sincerely pray for the rebirth of the future, truly filling everyone's emptiness and regrets in the past year!</p>
<p>A Slight Explanation of the "Collapse Wind"</p>
<p>There is "collapsing foot" in rotating credit associations, "collapsing accounts" in lending, and there is a lot of talk about "collapsing" in the market, and it seems that there is also something brewing politically; a collapse sound, in the current situation of frequent urging of the lunar drum, a person with a little neurasthenia feels overwhelmed by the feeling of "how to end the year." However, this is only limited to patients with neurasthenia who have this feeling, and those who are a little more normal and have deep calculations can turn a blind eye to it. You see: despite the threat of "collapsing feet" and "collapsing accounts," rotating credit associations and high-interest loans are rising and thriving; although there are cries of "closing down sale" and "clearing out inventory at low prices" on the road, the Christmas dinners over 100,000 yuan are still sold out two days in advance, and Christmas cakes costing 280,000 yuan are also snapped up to be used as decorations for revelry; although many people with neurasthenia in Beijing, Shanghai and other places are gathering and sending telegrams to "overthrow something," those who are being overthrown seem to be making new offerings and turning a deaf ear; Zhuangzi said: "Splendor is bland," and the saying goes: "There is nothing in the world, but mediocre people disturb themselves." Mediocre people are probably the most tragic characters in the world!</p>
<p>Prohibition of Night Dances</p>
<p>Christmas, New Year, a string of good times and festivals, people in the city of course want to "dance to the music," as if only "dancing" can express their celebration. However, good things come with twists and turns: Shanghai is to ban night dances after twelve o'clock, Hangzhou is only allowed to embellish it in the form of social dances, and it is said that Chongqing and Kunming and other places seem to ban it but not ban it; in short, dancing is not like smoking opium, in order to maintain morality and security, "banning" should be occasionally banned, but the general principles of "noble entertainment" and "consideration for business difficulties" are always taken into account. Therefore, new dancers are no longer allowed in after twelve o'clock, and people inside can still dance as usual; a few lookouts are set up at the door, and the social dances inside can still be danced with dance partners. The ban on dancing is like this, it doesn't matter much, I hope that the large-scale ban on opium and drugs starting from January next year must be swift and severe!</p>
<p>Goodbye "Year of the Dog"</p>
<p>The major corruption in the collection of land taxes in Jiangyin, the embezzlement of accounts and goods by the social section chief of Yuhuan, and the demands of celebrities in Suzhou are coming one after another, forming the last few disreputable public cases of this year. The new era is approaching, and the climax of corruption incidents in the past year does not seem to have come to an end. Frankly speaking, prices have been high in recent years, so of course the yellow filth is more wonderful near the end of the year, so we really should not make any false accusations against prominent officials and celebrities. This year is the Year of the Dog, and although the dog's nature is loyal, when it is anxious, it will jump over the wall, so it is inevitable that there will be many unexpected things; next year is the Year of the Pig, and although the pig is dull, it can be content and know its fate, and even if it has love in its belly, it probably won't often drill out of its doghouse like a dog to steal and touch things; the end of the year and the beginning of the year are the time to switch fortunes, and when the pig's luck comes to the celebrities next year, everyone will be sitting at home, engaging in establishing virtue and words, and no longer showing their faces, there are not many days left this year, and it is no wonder that corruption and eating filth incidents will perform a final climax before parting!</p>
