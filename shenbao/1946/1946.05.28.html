<h3>瀋陽各界聯合紀念週　蔣主席親臨致訓詞　指示復興東北三大原則</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽廿七日電〕瀋陽近日降雨即晴，晴後又降風沙，全市街道異常淸新，若特為元首灑揣者然，而元首在瀋每日開會·訓話·視察·接見賓客，幾無暇時，廿六日召集軍官點名訓話，立二小時又半。廿七日晨，各界擴大紀念週，又致訓極久，東北人士均稱道元首精神體力異於常人。蔣夫人除注意婦女及兒童工作外，於風土人情頗感興趣，並不辭辛勞，親作實地考察，人多稱道之。</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽廿七日電〕蔣主席蒞臨瀋市後，對復興東北產業極為關懷，廿七日上午曾召見東北行營經濟委會東北生產管理局理事長王家楨，王氏報告東北生產管理局奉令成立經過及工作方針，蔣主席指示，復興東北產業，不惟為復興東北之基礎，並為全國建設復興之基本，須努力進行。倘遇有任何困難可即報告，當予設法解決。</p>
<p>〔又電〕瀋各界聯合紀念週，廿七日上午九時半在省府大禮堂舉行，到本市黨政軍各機關代表千餘人，蔣主席親臨主持，並即席致訓，略謂：余自民國三年來東北，迄今已三十二年，此次重來，頗多感想。東北為我國生命綫，淪陷瞬經十五年，此次國土重光，吾人於接收之後，應洗刷積恥，努力建設，庶不負為保衛及收復東北而犧牲之先烈。東北為我國工業最發達之地區，但大戰之後，殘破不堪，恢復之道，不可專持機械，而應遵照總理「雙手萬能」之道訓，（一）運用東北廣大之人力，重新建設，我文武官吏，如能以身作則，則東北同胞將樂於效命。（二）東北同胞受敵為長期之壓迫，故對於國家民族之觀念，特別堅强，加以社會組織嚴密，經濟基礎穩固，政府若能因勢利導，實行新縣制，推進地方自治，則東北必可成為三民主義之實騐區。（三）東北同胞有二大優點，即勤勞與節儉，今後若能作到迅速確實，以補救遲緩與虛浮之缺點，則精神方面之革背后，必可促成物資建設迅速的發展。最後，主席諱囑軍政人員愛護人民，同時亦盼望東北同胞輸錢輸力，協助政府，以謀本身之幸福與東北地方之安定。</p>

<p>〔本報北平廿七日電〕某軍事家稱：目前越過長春前進之國軍，其活動僅在於　固長春外圍，外間所傳直趨哈爾濱之說，尙屬過早。昨晚此間所獲前方電告，國軍正由兩路趨向永吉，一路由長春西指，另路由海龍北指，按永吉·長春相距咫尺，如永吉攻下，則長春之東側威脅即可解除，沿中長路北上國軍，則已進駐德惠，共軍於四平街一役後，已無大規模有組織之抵抗，故國軍進展順利，發言人告記者，進駐哈爾濱事尙有待。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕白崇禧上將可能於本月底返京，就任國防部長新職，國防部次長三人之人選已見本報專電，聞第一廳廳長內定錢卓倫（原　叙　廳長），第二廳廳長內定鄭介民（原軍令部廳長），第三廳廳長內定張秉鈞（原軍令部廳長），第四廳廳長內定趙一　（原軍委會中將高參），第五廳廳長內定方天（原軍政部軍務署長），第六廳長尙未決定，憲兵司令仍為張　，軍法處長內定劉維曾，副官處長內定陳春　，財務署長內定林伯森，新聞局長內定鄧文儀，兵役局長內定徐思平，史料局長內定吳石其，且各局亦經內定，至所屬四個總司令人選，　提人員頗多，待主席作最後決定。國防部之業務，在部長之下分由三次長處理，一次長主管第一·第二·第三三廳，辦理部長交辦關於人馬動員者，一次長主管第四·第五·第六三廳，辦理關於物資者，一次長則主管一般業務，處理程序須　　參謀總長轉呈部長，參謀總長對於　隊調遺作戰直隸國民政府主席。又自六月一日起，原軍政部，陸軍總部，軍委會各部門即不收文，由各軍位派員合組總收發室，分別辦理。</p>

<h3>徐永昌訪馬歇爾　民盟留滬代表今日晉京</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕主席所乘之美輪號專機，已於上星期由京飛抵瀋陽，據國府中人談，主席即將返京。主席抵瀋後，對關內之軍事調處效果及京滬有關政協商談之情况，夙夜僅念，聞二十五日深夜尙手擬且詳電致京，有所指示，並聞過去三日中，主席與馬歇爾物使會互相問訊，並交換意見。聞今最晟重令部長徐永昌偕該部皮參軍訪晤馬使時，曾談及主席歸期。今晟中樞紀念週舉行後，政府代表對於促進商談一事，曾舉行一預備性之會談，中共代表似尙未忘情宣傳，對於停戰之努力，顯然已「文塲重於武塲」，斤斤於宣傳休戰。據中宣部負責人談：中共對於宣傳休戰之辦法，現尙堅持三方協議之成見，其實如武塲不能停打，一切都將徒勞。以今日各方之活動言，似乎仍在鈎心鬥角中。　民盟隆基即將來京，各黨派留滬要角，亦有於月底來京說，但一切大前提之決定，均須待主席返京後，方能展開。</p>
<p>〔法新聞社南京廿七日電〕軍事三人小組會議政府代表即軍令部長徐永昌將軍，本日訪問馬歇爾特使，此為徐式十餘日以來與馬使之首次談話，惟馬使一方面仍與中共代表周恩來繼續個別談判。徐　兩氏本日談話，聞曾涉及東北局勢之若十方面，徐氏聲明政府迫切希望局勢改善，並當竭其全力，以謀問題及早解決。軍事三人小組會議何日重開，尙未定奪，但接近政府人士預料為期不遠。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃悉：民主同盟方面留滬代表張君　·黃炎培·梁漱溟·章伯鈞·沈鈞　等，昨日上午曾一度集議，決定今晟九時聯袂晋京。據民盟某　咸人士稱：民盟代表，久留滬地，對首都政治及人局動態頗感隔膜，為瞭解　前政局不協調之詳情計，必需晋京，民盟代表於抵京後，將本　　立塲，對政局發表主張。</p>
<h3>魯境戰爭離已漸息　前途並不盡樂觀　各地共軍調動仍極頻繁</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南京廿七日電〕此間某些人士，日來有一個新的樂觀看法，認為共軍在東北之潰敗，可能影響魯局前途，趨於和緩，魯境共軍之攻擊行動，或將及時而止。惟據某軍事觀察家之意見，則認為山東問題之下，魯局前途，不盡樂觀。</p>

<p>〔本報濟南廿六日電〕此間一般人士對於濟南小組日昨在臨沂與共軍商談之結果，印象殊淡，認為共軍藉詞不允交還明水龍山等地，顯屬缺乏和平誠意，魯局前途，仍難樂觀。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南廿六日電〕據悉膠東確有蘇聯軍官百餘人，担任訓練共軍砲兵之工作。又訊膠東共軍有三團，係蘇聯裝備，惟迄今尙未獲得確實證據。</p>
<p>〔中央社濟南廿六日電〕軍息：共軍動態　誌如下：（一）渤海軍區趙　部千餘人，廿日晚由桓台竄長山，準備進犯張店。（二）解放第四師廿五團及地方部隊千餘，共約三千餘，廿三日向南定國軍陣地進犯，現仍在戰鬥中。（三）　縣共軍均向南竄，揚言進攻徐州。（四）魯南各地區共軍及地方團隊中，戰力較强者，均限期向泰安以北地區集結，幷揚言進犯濟南。（五）新四軍一部約千餘，十八日由泰安竄萬德增防。（六）解放第九師二千餘人及趙　舟警備第七旅三千餘人，廿二日均開至周村西北，有攻周村全圖。（七）龍山廿五日增來　家標部警備千人，明水增來袁也烈部二千餘人。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>擁護國際法的新原則</h3>
<p>昨聯合社續倫堡電訊，謂六個月前德國社黨高級人員廿一名，以發動戰爭等罪開始受聯合國審訊，參加審訊諸人於此案開審時，鮮有能知其進行將歷多少時日者。假使各國起訴書嚴格的限於戰爭罪及殘殺歐洲數百萬平民罪，則審訊時期可以大為縮短；乃聯合國於此次審訊中，將造成一種環境，推翻公認之國際公法與條約而實行侵略戰爭者，無論是否出於故意，亦一併列入。在實質方面，聯合國擬證明實行侵略戰者為有罪，擁護發動侵略戰之人秉政者亦為有罪，其輔助侵略之全部機構，包括德內閣與參謀總部在內，均為犯罪團體，因此龐大計劃，遂令審訊時間延長云云。現在紐倫堡的審訊，正在進行，尙未結束，將來紐倫堡國際法庭的判詞如何，現在自然無法測知。不過就檢察官的起訴以及目前的種種跡象，現在紐倫堡的審訊却根據上述報道的原則，即發動並擁護執行侵略之人均為有罪，其輔助侵略之全部機構，均為犯罪團體。這是國際法上的一種新原則，為了確保將來的持久和平我們擁護這新原則。</p>
<p>這幾天審訊日本戰犯的東京國際軍事法庭的美國法官郝經世及我國法官梅汝璈博士，正自東京來華，我們猶憶月初日本戰犯在東京開審時，被告的辯護律師，企圖檢舉法官的資格于以糾劾，限制法庭的權力，以減輕罪狀，更進而企圖根本推翻是項法庭，藉使日本諸戰犯得以逍遙法外。茲值東京國際軍事法庭中美兩法官行經上海之機會，願對日本職犯的審訊，貢獻我們的所見。</p>
<p>第一，日本戰犯辯護律師的一切企圖，如根本推翻東京國際軍事法庭的機構，或限制該法庭的權力，應根本于以駁斥。在日本戰犯辯護律師的陳述中，竟然提到波茨頓宣言為有條件的投降，與德國納粹的崩潰情形不同，德國可以有「戰犯」的審訊，而日本，據這些律師的見解，則無所謂「戰犯」。縱有所謂「戰犯」，亦祇能以當時國際法所認許者，如殺害平民，虐待戰俘等為限，而不包括執行國家政策之人。又謂檢察官所提出的發動侵略戰爭罪，使人類遭逢災難罪，旣不見於當時的國際法，亦不見於波茨頓宣言。則東京國際軍事法庭的本身存在縱使沒有問題，亦祇能審訊當時國際法所認許的一般戰罪，如殺害平民，虐待戰俘等。凡此企圖，其在表面雖為維護受訊人的權益，然其政治意義，尤重於司法的意義。此其目的，端在公開聲明而著於官文書的紀録，即日本的投降為有條件的，而非無條件的屈服。東京國際軍事法庭雖為一軍法機關，本身不應該注意到政治方面的考慮，但自從對日作戰以來的歷次風際文告，如開羅宣言以及波茨頓宣言本身均為具有約束力的國際法案，日本是完全的無條件投降，該律師等的一切企圖，均應不容猶豫，依據法律，予以嚴正的駁斥。</p>
<p>第二，為確保世界的持久和平，我們竭誠擁護這一國際法的新原則，就是，發動，執行，並擁議侵略的一切人等均為有罪，輔助侵略之全部機構，包括內閣及參謀本部在內，均為犯罪團體。國際法原是一稱活的法律，它隨着國際情形的不同而隨時在滋長發育。過去的戰鬥員與非戰鬥負之分，不判明轟炸的限制，均因新武器及新戰術的使用而失效。倘使在這個原子能的時代，而不建立起這個國際法的新原則，即發動侵略之人為有罪，輔助侵路的機構為犯罪團體，則如何能使將來的國際秩序趨於安定。陳腐的戰爭觀，即戰爭為一個國家，政策之延續，本身不為罪，決不適用於這個原子能的時代。發動侵略戰爭本計就是罪，就應受法律的制裁；這個原則的建立，必大有裨益於將來國際秩序的維繫。為了擁護這個原則，我們覺得目下在東京受訊的二十八個日本戰犯，為數實在太少，著實有一些衆所周知為侵略罪魁的日本戰犯，如今仍復逍遙法外，倘使不將他們繩之以法，何以建立起這個新的國際法原則？我們希望在受審的二十八個戰犯僅是日本戰犯受審的第一批，必將有侵略元凶繼起受訊，受到國際法律的制裁。</p>
<p>第三，中國遭受日本的侵略歷時最久，為害最烈，中國可以提出大批戰犯名單，都是侵略中國的元凶。但東京國際軍事法庭旣為一種國際法庭審訊，或將使它的工作更形繁劇，而在中國固已有軍事法庭開始審訊，現在日本或它處之日本侵華戰犯，若不由東京國際軍事法庭審訊，亦應迅速照中國政府所列名單，予以逮捕，引渡中國法庭，聽候制裁。</p>
<p>人類經過了第二次世界大戰以後，又值原子能時代的來臨，應該建立起一種新的國際秩序，就是武力的拋棄而代之以國際的法治。建立這個法治的國際社會，首須建立起發動侵略有罪的原則。這是為了這原因，所以我們對紐倫堡，特別是對東京的審訊，寄予殷切的期望。</p>

<h3>學校將因風潮破產　鬧成學生無書可讀　浙敎廳許廳長報吿敎育危機</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州訊〕浙教應許紹棣廳長在省府上届紀念週報吿，本年度省敎育經費編列數字，及省敎育機關目前經費困雖情形。茲經探誌於下：本年度省敎育經費總數，中央核定經常費六千五百十五萬元，臨時費二億九千四百七十五萬元，此外由敎廳主管之補助支出經費二百九十萬六千元。經常門六千餘萬元，包括省立各校各社敎機關等五十餘單位之全年事業費與行政費，臨時門二億九千餘萬元，包括各校之設備費，校舍建築修理費，以及全部省立各校公費生師範生職業學校學生之主副食費，其中大部份為學生膳費。茲分述如下：經常門（一）敎德全年經費二百六十三萬五千元，區區之數，除維持經常行政之外，如臨時舉辦一事，則頗費周章，對於本應部份更無論矣。</p>
<p>杯水車薪　無濟於事</p>
<p>（二）省立中等以上學校，共三十一所，目前各學校校舍，祇有十一所，尙有固定之校舍，但亦破壞不堪，佔計修理之費用，爲數已屬驚人，但已領到復員費，尙祇有六千萬元之數，在此六千萬元中，又須除去接收僞校之維持費，所以各校分配之復員費，如杯水車薪，無濟於事。各校現無法恢復舊觀，更難達到改進之目的，各校辦理之困難，尙不僅此，本年度敎育費總數，核定與上年度相同，但學校方面，班級每年自然增加，生活又如此高漲，敎廳編制預算，無論如何統籌，總感到萬分困難。省立各校之經費，不盡拮据，而且不能按時領到，原因爲要經過許多週折，手續紛緊，有此種種原因，以致更加困難，尤爲過去領取公糧一事如卅四年份之公糧及米代金，迄今未曾領到。各校迫切無法，達到極端爲難。學生爲自己吃飯關係，向校方發生責難，演成校長灰心。如此局而，實在不能維持久長，長此演變下去，可能使一若十學校，因風潮而破產，鬧成學生無書可讀爲止。</p>
<p>顧此失比　動感棘手</p>
<p>（三）省立各塲館之經費，則比較更爲困難，除省立圖書館，博物館，本列有少數維持費預算外，其餘如省立杭民敎館，杭體育塲等預算，已全部被删。目前館長塲長薪俸統在敎廳開支。顧此失彼，動感棘手。其次爲臨時門，臨時門支出最大爲學生膳費。本年省立中學公費生及師範生共計七千八百名，每名每月主副食費一月份四千元，二，三，兩月份各五千元，四至十月份各八千元。又職業學生一千一百八十名，每名每月主副食費一月份二千五百元，二，三兩月份三千元，四至十月份五千元，中央原核定祇照六千餘名計算，相差二千餘名，所以經費短列一億二千五百二十九萬元。再次關於臨時補助費之支出，本省現有二百二十五所中等以上學校，除省立外，共計一百九十四個單位，其餘尙有許多社敎機關以每一單位平均分配，為數不過一萬餘元。所以各縣私』立學校請求補助者，實難予以如願。在過去幾年內，敎育經費雖亦同樣困難，黃前主席極力主張提撥積穀變價，來補充敎育經費，現在沈主席主張與糧食部相同，不以提用積穀辦法爲然，此後自當由省府另籌辦法。所以本省敎育事業，將日瀕於更困難之境地，如果對於經費無法解決，下學期可能出之於停招公費生與享受公糧待遇之職校學生，或甚至於暫停招生，緊縮班次。但社會上放着一個矛盾之現象，就是推行國民敎育之結果，小學及初中之畢業生，一年多過一年，需要中學添加班次，亦愈形迫切，一這問題似値得大家注意。（蝶）</p>
<h3>恢復收復區中學　敎部訂蔣勵辦法　暫限省市立及優良私校</h3>

<h3>長春廿九天　（十）</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者　邵愼之</p>
<p>語言隔閡，總不懂，　譯給他們聽，仍是「不行」。說是旣然不是你的就用不着你管，破口大駡，對貝克特當胸一拳。我們警惕這種舉動不簡單，悄悄的喚門口守衛的共軍來。這時大家聽見吵嚷，都跑到樓下來看，工友也來了，瑞士朋友則仍留在會客空裏。這幾位戰士還在指這指那駡。堅稱非借不可。「你們這些傢伙，都跑不了的」。同頭看見工友，立刻教訓他們：</p>
<p>「你們還在這裏幹什麼？你們已經解放了，服侍這些小子幹什麽？我們是為人民服務的，你們快走」。幾個工友一看形勢緊張，立刻溜開。</p>
<p>門口守衛進來問他們是那裏的，答稱廿七師廿一旅樣子還是十分兇狠，及問名字就支吾不說，顯出一付點油子相：「告訴你，我姓馬，你怎麼樣」結果弄得守衛的也　起火來，四五個兵帶務槍押了他們出去。</p>
<p>隔不多久，這幾個寶貝帶務槍又來了，我們眞担心他們會衝突起米，但沒有衝突，終於把他們所要借的東西拿去了。</p>
<h3>向毛澤東抗議</h3>
<p>從十六日到廿七日，我們足足被拘留了十一天，我們用盡了許多的心力向中共的周保中，晴求恢復自由，但是請求儘管請求，不睬依舊不睬。度日如年，這短短的十一天，眞像是沉長的十一年，我們從總裏望到總外去，但見枯萎的楊柳，已從焦黃的顏色，變成了可愛的靑翠。這錄色的世界，正說明離着我們春火的心城還遙遠呢！</p>
<p>廿七的晚上，也是芮克少校將飛回瀋陽的前一天，（結果因為汽油問題延至廿九日，始行起飛）我們備了些幾只他喜歡吃的菜，為他餞行。他和我們化在一起的時候，他的共嗚與幽默，解決了找們不少的家寞。</p>
<p>當我們吃過晚飯的時候，大家回意，這是一個時機：我們沉長而無理的被拘禁，該向中共毛澤東提出抗議了。我們要求芮克少校，替我們把這信息帶出去，芮克少校鑒於我們巡境之困難，也毅然同意我們的請求。</p>
<p>美聯社麥德生和支加哥日報惠勒二人，担任起草，但中國同業，惑到處境困難，決意退出。但是聲明精神上是和他們一致的。抗議書的譯文如下：</p>
<p>「廷安中央執行委員會主席毛澤東先生：</p>
<p>下面簽名的我們五個美國記者，因為，自從四月十六日的晚上開始，我們便被中共共軍拘禁在長春，迄至於今，而和外界完全隔絕。我們謹向你提出抗議。</p>
<p>開始的時候，西面攻城軍總司令劉其人少將告訴我們，因為顧盧我們的安全，於是不得不在我們旁邊設置警衛。只要戰爭一結東，我們可以立刻自由行動。</p>
<p>劉將軍和我們談過這句話，直到現在，已是整整十一天了。這戰爭已平息了好久，可是我們依舊不能在長春自由行動，守衛的人很淸楚的告訴我們，他們來是執行上級交給他們的命令。這命令是不准我們外出，同時也阻止我們朋友的探望。</p>
<p>長春警衛司令周保中，也同樣地告訴我們，為着從「國民黨特務份子裏」「保護我們的安全」起見，我們是不准出去的。自從四月十八日起我們會見過三個中共的高級軍官，我們都向他們抗議，我們都願意發一張「沒有意外與爾無涉」的自願書，這魷是說在這個寗靜的都市喪決不再使中共軍隊，担憂我們的安全，可是每人都拒絕了我們從四月十九日起，我們僅僅奉「命」在護衛之下出去過兩次。共中有一次，當我們獲得一個衛士的允許之後去攝取一所起火的房子的鏡頭，忽然米了另一個軍官，取去了我們的兩個攝影機。至今尚來送還。</p>
<p>在衛士鹽視之下，讓我們在長春的街上走着，讓我們在許多成千成百以前是我們的敵人，而今確自由自在搖擺在大街上的日本人眼前走着，我們深切惑到，這是一個莫大的恥辱，因此，我們對於這種可疑的外出的權利，也不再考慮他了。我們承認中共高級將領們，對我們非常客氣，但是他們每次的努力，是限制我們的自由，延遲我們回瀋陽的日子</p>
<p>我們過去在延安。聽到新聞自由的原則；在重慶也和中共代表討論過這個問題，可是，我們現在的處境，確巧相反。</p>
<p>我們是中立性的記者，報導國共兩黨的消息。我們謹向你要求即刻的自由。」</p>
<h3>承認執行錯誤</h3>
<p>我們和共軍方面接觸廿天，五月二日以前絕無眞實的自由。周保中再三聲明是為了保護我們的「安全」，萬一我們中間有一個不測，中共的責任負不起云。就是我們願意簽為他們脫卸責任的文件給周，也說還是負不了責，這就是說：硬要負責。硬負責何以用槍刺對我們？何以共軍在我們圈子裏放槍？何以共軍給貝克特當胸一拳？諸如此類，我們很難相信，一一有養意的。</p>
<p>開始大司務要到街上買菜，也經過我們向守衛者請求，才准出去。我們實在要謝謝兩個大司務和三位工友，共軍曾經煽動他們（我們相信，不是出於上級的指示，而是平時教育的結果），要他們不要招呼我們，但二十天來，他們已成為我們最好的朋友。</p>
<p>後來中共東北局宣傳部長凱豐與慎之談話中，對我們表示歉意，他說：「東北局僅指示長春方面紹對負責保護諸位的安全，想不到諸位因此失去自由，要是東北局早來就好了」。（中共東北局在五月一日由吉林遷長者）愼之問凱豐說：「這樣說來這次事件的發生，是不是機械執行命令的緣故。凱豐說；</p>
<p>「是的，過於機械了一點。」</p>
<p>凱豐在五月二日下午來寫所看我們，問起他塔斯社記者行踪如何，回答說他不知道有一個塔斯社記者在這裏。新華社記者劉白羽，是北平執行部中共方面記者之一，隨東北小組人員到瀋陽，我們原在瀋陽，對於每一個新來的同業都非常歡迎，但他這時忽然在長春出現，長春中央社改為新華社他並沒有來看我們。　（未完）</p>

<h3>嘉興臨難關</h3>
<p>— 本報十九日通訉　特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>嘉興，是滬杭鐵路的中心，號稱天堂的杭嘉湖據點之一。記者於十五日由杭州午車到嘉興，我逕往鄉下跑，看見有變個農胞正在收割麥子，他們初見我時，有些書怕。後來，我問他們實際悄形，他們才告訴我：「米都雜光了，現在要買米吃了！」我問他們：「蠶實寶如何？」「祇望蠶寶寶了。但近來氣候忽冷忽熱，對於實實又有很大的妨害。」</p>
<h3>嘉興無餘糧　偏有人來此採購</h3>
<p>我才踏着月光回到城裏來，城裏議論紛紛，都為了米價在不斷的往上跳，已經越出五萬元大關，覺得很不安。小學教員為着「米」而罷了教後，縣政府勤工罷工了，縣立中學教員怠教了。十九個鄕鎭的鄉鎮長向縣政府要求辭職，他們幹不下去了。</p>
<p>我曾為此事訪問過嘉興的紳士，教員，黨部負責人，縣府負責人，律師，農胞，土人等，都一致對米價上漲表示書怕。米價為什麼會上漲呢？米業公會的負責人說：「杭州市成立了採購省外餘糧委員會，但採購糧食的人不向省外去質，偏向嘉屬一帶買。上海市成立了採購餘糧委員會，也專向沒有餘糧的熹興來買，嘉興本可自給自足，因為上述兩個原因，愈弄愈不如，達到了嚴重恐慌的程度。一</p>
<p>最近縣政府奉命徽購軍糧，給價兩萬四千元，與市價相差兩萬六千元，縣政府怪上而沒有規定差價，因為規定差價後可以把所差的數字向富戶攤派，但如果眞的有有了着似的規定，恐怕攤派到富戶身上時，富戶又轉嫁到貧農的身上，這又怎麽辦？</p>
<h3>三縣參議會　集議向省級請願</h3>
<p>問題在鄕間有糧太少，高價都不容易購得，何次這區誠的兩萬四千元呢？據說這兩萬四千元是</p>
<p>蔣主席在三月十五日規定的，常時米價還不到雨萬四千元，而有級命令才在五月十日到達，又限定六月十日把糧照解。人民對於蔣主席表一示絕對擁護，但對於省級命令的遲遲頒下表示異議。而對於中央撥的款項轉到省級，省級一直到現在還沒有發下，又表示異議。目下，嘉興要微購糧食一萬八千石，熹善一萬五千石，平湖一萬五千石，共四萬八千石，嘉興，熹善，平湖的三縣參議會，縣黨部，定十八日在嘉興集議，向省級請願。</p>
<h3>往鄉下放賑　老百姓見了害怕</h3>
<p>此間縣政人員說：「現在縣政經費，僅賴屠宰捐維持，其他稅收，都徽乎其微。」談到縣稅，計有營業牌照稅，使用牌照稅，屠宰稅，娛樂筵席稅，房捐等，中央直接稅，則有營業稅，所得稅，遣產稅，印花稅，利得稅等。常地人民對直接稅局的徽收法有很多談論，因為直接稅局對商家的營業，不問有否賬册，都來一個估計。商家說近來營業淸淡，直接稅局不相信，這不相信的結果，一個住房人僅納房租二千元，而所納捐稅卻超越了兩千元。政府不想信人民，於是人民也對政府懷疑。政府往鄕下放振，老百姓見了害怕，要去問問「先生」再說，「先生」為何？就是鄕間的土劣，或是教書先生，或是幫會的老大。聽說有一軍隊過境，強以所謂一榮譽香烟」向人民推銷，交由縣政府攤派，縣府也「等因奉此」的轉下去，人民說：「我們到底要出多少錢？就一次出足好了，不要零零碎碎的來麻煩我們。」</p>
<h3>治安費了力　仍感到許多困難</h3>
<p>現在，駐在縣裏的靑年軍，確是得着很多好評的。一般老百姓因為靑年軍來，改正了不少不正確的觀念。嘉興附廓的南滙鎮，不久以前被洗劫，迎勢察所的輕機槍也被奪去了。平湖班汽划十一時常要出事。嘉北新睦·王江涇一帶，很有點不安寗。縣政府的人說：「我們實在對於治安費盡了力掠，但是質感到了許多困難</p>
<p>難，眞的難極了，以嘉興這樣的天堂地方，要遭遇到這樣空前的困難，這到底是什麼道理？有人說這是社會問題，但社會問題是什麽人造成的呢？關於編餘隊伍，中央早經命令遺送還鄕，或是付田耕種。關於捐稅問題，中央省級，早經命令廢除一切苛雜。關於軍糧問題，中央已早早遠價購買，我看問題的焦點，是在「統忽」與「自私」！</p>
<h3>法國科學硏究　開始走向復興道路</h3>
<p>— 胡品淸譯</p>
<p>假使我們回憶停戰協定簽訂以後的法國的紊亂情形，我們便能很容易地知道當時決國科學的紊亂狀況。事實上，自一九三九年宣戰的時候起，法國科學的硏究已告停頓，因為大部份的研究人員都陸續出征了，其餘的則從事硏究直接與戰爭及國防有關的科學。</p>
<p>物質艱困</p>
<p>就物質方面而言：一部分科學儀器和材料都因轟炸而損失了，尤其是化學物品和製儀器的原料——金屬及無綫電燈泡——特別缺乏，而且媒電又是愈來愈少，巴黎科學院的報告也因印刷困難而不能按期發表，國外的科學圖書雜誌，又不能寄到巴黎，因此，法國科學家便漸漸地與外界隔絕了。</p>
<p>人才缺乏</p>
<p>除了物質方面的困難以外，科學人才也告缺乏。有的科學家上前統了，受傷了，或者被俘了，有的奉命赴北非，英國或美國去了。雖然有的逃到法國南部非淪陷區，但是又因為缺乏材料，不能從事研究。此外，還有許多科學家如郎之萬，拉比克等，都被俘了。</p>
<p>德人摧殘</p>
<p>德國人蓋意阻礙法國科學的發展，所以佔領了採礦學校和法蘭西大學裏的若里奧的實驗室，封閉了巴黎大學，格勒挪布勒大學和斯拉斯堡大學。此外，還有轟炸逮捕都使研究工作受到極大的阻礙。</p>
<p>學說發明</p>
<p>最後，在維瑛政府之下，科學家待遇過於菲薄，因此，許多研究人才，都只得放棄文化工作，以謀解決麵包問題。所以法國科學人才，漸漸地減少了。然而，他們對於國家的信心却十分堅強，他們的理想也毫不改變。</p>
<p>數學方面，有常若及儒里亞，馬羅等，織續研究且發表過論文·理論物理學方面有多勒拿夫人硏究萬有引力。密雨拉硏究原子，德斯都施研究基本原理。關於電磁馬利亞尼有新的學說發明。</p>
<p>在醫藥方面最重要的是巴斯德學院，雖然缺少谷種材料，但是還是不斷供給藥物和血淸。</p>
<p>這一切，都證明了法國科學界，依然不斷的進展。</p>
<p>兩種活動</p>
<p>年來，法國的科學活動，主要的分兩種：（一）為原理的深究，（三）為訓練靑年科學家。就研究原理方面而言，一九四一年，一九四二年及一九四三年，先後設立了數學研究所，象徽邏輯研究所及理論化學研究所。就訓練青年科學家而言，即為供給被俘的科學家以各種科學圖書雜誌，幫助在暗中從事研究工作的學生。</p>
<p>巴黎解放以後，若里奧和歐杜柏爾等，開始了科學研究的革新工作。科學家已經有一個組織，而且若里奧又提議改養國立科學研究所人員的物質生活，並改組國立科學研究所。按照新的組織，該研究所之上有一個總管理處，由十五個科學家組織成，還有一個理事會，由三百個人組成。每逢專題研究的時候，由總管理處遴選專家組織專門委員會。曾因生活問題面放棄科學研次工作的法國靑年，如今又光後回來重理其科學生涯了，因為他們受了外國科學進步的繳勵，同時，他們也知道決定一個國家的國際地位的因素，是該國的科學和思想家。</p>
<h3>中原之謎</h3>
<p>— 十八日豫北通訊　范世動</p>
<p>那時德國的西織，無戰事還是無職事。</p>
<p>中原之謎，因徐·周·自三氏之行，揭露了一半，然而還有一半沒有揭露，就是中共方面何以大驚小怪掀起這個風浪來？</p>
<p>李先念統一共軍</p>
<p>成立六個團</p>
<p>在中原的共軍領袖，是大家所知通的李先念。過去有人說他是偶本匠出身，但是現在查明，並非一個本匠。當抗戰中武淡撒退的時候，他從延安帶了四五十個幹部到了溝竹，和土共在一起，訓練了一個教導營。此後，他南下聯絡鄂中共軍領袖楊學淸，統一中原共軍，成立六個團。新四軍事變發生後，他為新四軍第五師的師長。從此，他在大洪山，桐柏山，大別山三山之間，竄來竄去，擴張勢力，李擊敗了鄂東保安第四國，及吞併了偽軍王伯淸部後，就成了十三·十四·十胞三個旅，於是有所謂豫鄂邊區保安司令部的組織，據說李先念有指揮十個團作戰的能力。</p>
<p>東北正鬧得天觀地覆的時候，周恩來突然放了一砲，說是中原也將有大規模的戰事發生。徐永禺·周恩來·白魯德三位先生，還親自跑到宣化店去了一次，調查眞相。今日中國的中原，不是對共軍向外發展</p>
<p>對共軍向外發展</p>
<p>國軍加戒備</p>
<p>敵軍投降以後，李先念德隊伍不僅控制了大洪·桐柏兩山，而且還遠攻到襄樊附近，那時正是去年十一二月之間，聲勢十分浩大。可是雙溝一次敗仗，弄得不可收拾，結果逃到鐵路以東光山織山一帶，要不是有停職協定命令，李的部隊已經在中原沒有克足之地了。</p>
<p>中原共軍到了羅山·光山，原僅佔了南面一角，為想再起起見，從停職命令後，己經侵入到了高城·潢川西南方面。閉就光山而說，原僅佔了四個鄕村，可是規在也已佔到十二個鄕村了，佔全光山四分之三的面樍。國軍對於共軍這樣再求發展，百然加以戒備。照李先念看來：中原外面形勢，沒有方法讓他發展，於是另轉念頭，說是中原共軍沒有糧吃，要求就食皖北‘其實共軍在那面，第一時期，要吃多少糧，向老百姓派多少糧，第二時期，向老百姓每畝派糧四十斤；第三時期，老百姓有多少糧，要了多少糧·光山每斗米市價是三千元，共軍曾經以一千五百元一斗拋了出來。共軍沒有糧吃，那只有天知道了。而且政府還上一個大當，借二萬萬元給共軍購糧。共軍沒有糧吃的話說不過去，但是仍舊還想一條走路，於是說國軍對共軍將有大規模的攻勢了。</p>
<p>各兵士領到子彈</p>
<p>準備竄皖北</p>
<p>在半個多月前，共軍每一士兵，已經發了二件　衫，五雙草鞋，同時發了七八十顆子彈，準備到皖北去；而且其中一二千人，已經喬裝鹽民到了目的地。中原到皖北去，也許魷是要到東北去的第一步；而日依照羅山協定，雙方部隊不准移動。因此國軍對於共軍這種企圖與對協定的破壤不得不出以盬視的游度，共軍以中原將有大規模的內戰，就是指此而說。今天中原共軍如有優厚兵力，不知早已攻了多少拭，掠了多少地，而且另有一抓說法出來，至少是將其攻掠的拭市釘上了「解次」的牌子。共軍團長逃出來</p>
<p>共軍團長逃出來</p>
<p>白馬出賣掉</p>
<p>中原共軍有其一個內在苦衷，每天總有幾個逃兵出來，前幾天還有一個團長騎了一匹白馬逃了出來，這匹白馬以五萬元的代價賣給了老百姓，作為逃難的資本。但是這點他們不好意思對着小組說出，作為要求去皖北或東北的理由。</p>

<h3>唐努烏梁海問題</h3>
<p>編輯先生：外蒙問題，已由上年八月二十四日，國防最高委員會與中央常務委員會臨時聯席會議席上，蔣主席發表演說，允許他獨立，嗣於十月二十日，蒙古公民投票，冬數贊成獨立，本年一月四日，我國民政府發出通告，承認外蒙獨立。獨立事遂確定。然我國舊時蒙古地方，除車臣汗，土謝圖汗，三音諾顏汗，札薩克圖汗四部外，尚有科布多與唐努烏梁海二部，科布多於外蒙第一次獨立，不願加入自治組織，曾困守科城一載有餘。民國四年，我承認科布多為自治誠域，科屬王公聞之謹嘆。這種情形，曾誣駐紮科布多佐理員洪楨報告我政府。足見雖同為蒙族，因抓族世系不同，意見不能一致。唐努烏梁海在科布多北面，人民為土文次及胡哈脫兩族；土文次族不願加入外蒙組織，另立唐努土文次共和國，我國國內正在多事之秋，未暇過問，實在是疏忽的。此次承認外蒙獨立，唐努土文次共和國怎樣處置來曾提及，不免成為疑問？此國是否已自動取銷了獨立？或併入外蒙共和國？還是未曾投票？來便臆斷。及見一月四日本報合眾社倫敦二日電，根據倫敎太研士報載外蒙北邊丹努杜佛共和國，已正式併入蘇聯版圖云云。查丹努杜佛，譯普和唐努土文相同，據此，則此國旣未併入外蒙共和國，又米取銷獨立，應仍為我國領土，同為公民投票自決區域，蘇聯怎樣可以擅自作主，併入他的版圖呢？一國領土，有一國之主權，允許他獨立，尚且要經過公民投票手續，蘇聯旣係聯合國之一，與我國站在同一條陣線上，斷無未得我同意，即默不作聲，把我頜土併入他版圖的道理。我國得到這樣消息，應該立即向蘇聯提出嚴重抗議，怎樣遲之又久，噤若塞蟬，絕無反響呢！在這新潮流激蕩中，素米隸屬於人的土地，大家要脫離　絆獨立，廟解印度越南東印度，都是很好榜樣，整個外蒙，素來是我國完整的領土，怎樣可以逆世界潮流，輕於放棄呢？常外蒙公民投票時，我政府曾派代表到蒙視察，科布多唐努烏梁海等處，都是投票區，都應盬視，不能例外。如共事前未曾注意到此，僅於庫倫等處視察，就算了事，米免有欠周密，這事應當查一究竟，以使補教。</p>
<p>查外蒙第二次獨立，事在民國十年；唐努土文次獨立，事在民國十一年。我政府得到此項消息，應富公開討論，決定承認與不承認，決定後就應當通告各編輯機關，據實編入中小學地理教科書中，使學生知道邊組問題性質嚴重，知所警惕，斷不能嚴守秘密，使全國國民茫然不曉。筆者於民國二十二三年間世界書局編輯初中本國地理，即將蒙古唐努土文次二個共和國，完全編入，二國國情也擇要記載，因為此等事常公開，不常秘密，國土已經變勸，書中對變動的事實仍一字不提，使學生得到的地理智識，未免失卻正確性。近年測騐高中學生，知道蒙古有兩個共和國的，十不得一二，初中及高小學生，更不必說了。這是教育界的忽略處。（鄙意教科書即不載此事，地理教師授課時，應當設法補充）。</p>
<p>雅爾達秘密協定發表，我國對這秘密協定，本無遵守之義務。他第一條說：外蒙共和國之地位，應保持不變。此條適與國父輔助外蒙之宗旨相同，我政府已自動實布，斷然乘認其獨立，表面似履行秘密協定，實際是無關。然此事形式上無利於蘇聯，是蘇聯帮助他族獨立事，事前還要秘密協定，他對此事的種視及有利，可以知道了。唐努烏梁海為我國領土，蘇聯旣未與聯合國秘密協定，又未得我國允許，乃自山劃人版圖內，改稱土文省，不知根據的是國際公法那一條？予取予求，毫無顧忌，此事如可承認，就無事不可飛認了。事經報端發現，我政府仍未有甚表示，各公團亦米有兩電結質大抵一因蘇聯未正式公布，二因東九省風雲正急，唐努烏梁海事已成次要問題，無暇顧及。現東九省與蘇聯糾紛，已告一段落，根據英國報紙，亦可提出抗議。抗議後蘇聯如願全邦交，仍本民族自決主義，山業人投票公決。惟此區聽命蘇聯已久，受麻醉已深，必收回管理數戰，矯正其心理，投票始有正確觀念。假使蘇方置之不理，或多方延宕，我應公告世界，任主持公道者公判，不可隱忍不言，致成懸突。凡我國民，應常知國士為重，雖一尺一寸土地，不司輕易損失。凡知有黨而不知有國的人，快點醒醒罷！要知道國家興亡，匹夫有責，現中國已臨最嚴重的陽頭，不可再重機动　，為虎作儀，陷國家於萬劫不復之地位。譯廉，五，廿五。</p>

<h3>羅斯福的「遊戲」</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉音</p>
<p>美國的前總統西雅督羅斯福和探險家威廉比庇是好朋友。據威廉比庇說，當他們在沙額摩山的時候，他們時常做一種『遊戲』。在促膝談心到深夜的時候，他們就到草地上去，舉首望空際搜索，尋找空中『飛馬座』左下端的一片半明不減的光霧小點，然後其中的一個人就背誦天文學上的話說：</p>
<p>那是安多美達的螺旋狀星河。</p>
<p>跟我們的銀河一樣大。</p>
<p>這是幾萬萬星河中的一個星河。</p>
<p>其中有一千億個太陽，每一個太陽都比我們的太陽大。</p>
<p>接着，羅斯福就向比庇露齒而笑說：『現在我想我們總算夠小了！讓我們去安眠吧』。</p>
<p>自誇自大的人類，很可以從羅斯福這個『遊戲』獲取教訓。</p>
<p>人生幾何？人類原是宇宙間極微渺的小動物，我們又何必這樣營營終日於爭權奪利呢？</p>
<p>還是讓我們利用這有涯之生，去為國為民為社會為人類謀些真正的福利吧！</p>
<p>特寫</p>
<h3>攔着繩子的草地</h3>
<p>— 強遜</p>
<p>公園裏，大草地的四週用繩子攔了起來，還插着幾塊「請勿入內」的木牌。遊客們望望然在草地外踱着。一個孩子牽着祖母的手走來。</p>
<p>「奶奶，到草地上去打千滾」。</p>
<p>「不行，你沒看見這塊牌子」？</p>
<p>孩子雖不識字，但是懂得攔繩子的意義。拉着祖母找凳子去了。</p>
<p>西角上，一位武裝同志扶着一位女士跨過，走進草地，傲然的向四週望着，那神情，像似敵偽時期突起封鎖綫的「特權階級」睨視着對封鎖綫着的吃戶口米的一羣。</p>
<p>一小隊穿藏靑制服的水兵，跳欄似的通過繩子，舒適的往草地上　。</p>
<p>繩子的人，有些騷然。</p>
<p>那邊，走來了三個不識中文的盟軍，對繩子望了望，又看看草地上的「制服同志」毫不猶豫的邁過繩子，隨即擇個地位，擺好姿勢，預備拍照。</p>
<p>繩子外的孩童們，再也顧不得「禁令」，　擁的鑽過繩子，把拍照的人圍了起來。</p>
<p>遊客們也不約而同的跨過繩子，走入草地，剎時就填滿了那塊「綠的空虛」。</p>
<p>檢起了一塊被拔脫的「請勿入內」的木牌，到草地上去巡視悻悻的對週圍望着。忽然，飛來了一隻小皮球，他很快的去拾了起來，昂然的往外走。一個小學生　了上來，要求發還那隻皮球。</p>
<p>「公園裏不可以踢皮球」！</p>
<p>「下次不踢了，謝謝你還給我吧」。</p>
<p>「不可以」。</p>
<p>「對不起」。</p>
<p>「再囉囌，連人一起關三個　點」。</p>
<p>小學生啞口了。含着淚走開去。—三個鐘點的自由，比一隻球更可貴。</p>
<p>太陽冒出了重雲。一個伴着孩子捉迷藏的遊客，脫下上裝，順手掛在旁邊「請勿入內」的木牌上，又摘下帽子，也擱在上面。看上去，那塊木牌很像插在田裏嚇麻雀的稻草人。</p>
<h3>橋</h3>
<p>— 王杏莊</p>
<p>橋，</p>
<p>從這岸跨到彼岸</p>
<p>它用嚴肅的目光，　盯視着急湍的流水，用微笑的心情迎接將來。</p>
<p>黑夜，黎明，屑屑的，</p>
<p>在它的旁邊流過又復回，</p>
<p>它不慨歎世事的滄桑演變，</p>
<p>它只知道服務人類的事情是應該！</p>
<p>健康</p>
<h3>防止近視</h3>
<p>— 胡德齡</p>
<p>我是一個近視眼患者，因為近視眼的緣故，許多地方吃虧，內心深感痛苦。記得以前有一次，我出去訪一位好友，適巧不在，候了多時，因另有要事，不及等待，向招待我的告辭。走出了門，不數步，遠遠的有人迎面而來，看不淸是誰，不敢攔上去招呼，恐怕弄錯了，自討沒趣，只顧低頭步行。但到面前，就是我要訪問的那位好友，他說：「我遠遠的招呼你，怎麼你理也不理？」好似責怪地語氣。我恐怕他內心不快，發生誤會，急忙連聲道歉，說明我患近視，他才恍然見諒。諸如此類的事情，很多很多。視覺不便，影響很大，有關終身幸福，至深且鉅。</p>
<p>近視眼的原因，光天遺傳的果有，而以後天平日不注意目部的衛生與攝養而成的居多。尤其是在學齡時期，年穉無知，不知目力的重要，不知怎樣愛護它，家長們亦疏忽不加指導，以致而成近視。及至將來，追悔莫及，銜恨終身。</p>
<p>眼睛旣是如此的重要，現在一般家長們，為自己兒童目力計，應該加以注意，糾正兒童閱讀不良姿態。茲就不佞目前想及的幾點，提示如下：</p>
<p>（一）適度的光綫——光綫不充足的地方，眼睛易感疲倦，不宜看書。強烈的陽光下，因為受到陽光中紫外綫及赤外綫強烈的逼射，有害目力，應予注意。</p>
<p>（二）適當的距離——光綫要自左方射來，如讀書，刺繡等近距離的用目，以距離一英呎最為適當，過近過遠，均不相宜。</p>
<p>（三）正確的姿勢——日常讀書，頭部要正，將書本傾斜，保持與水平面四十五度的角度，紙面和視綫成直角，否則于目光就有損害，睡時，切不可看書讀報。</p>
<p>（四）目力的調節——如果讀書或近距離的用目，經一小時之久，應閉目靜養一二分鐘，以資調劑，或時時抬頭遠望景物。</p>
<p>（五）電燈燈泡，以用毛底乳白或天藍色，最為妥當，為避免強烈燈光的直射，刺激眼球起見，最好要使室內燈光反射天花板，光綫由天花板反射下來。</p>
<p>（六）日暮將黑時，光綫不足，不應讀書寫字。</p>
<p>（七）有時，用目過久，眼淚涔涔流出，表示用目時候過多，眼睛已感疲倦，亟需休息，應該立即中止，合眼靜養，目光不致受損，否則一定有害無益。</p>
<p>（八）促進身體健康，每天早起或逛公園，或步行田野間，多接近大自然，怡情悅性，裨益身心，促進身體康強，加強目力。</p>
<p>以上的幾點，我想，能注意的話，不論兒童，不論成人，不問眼睛近視與否，目力健全的，不致於近視；已近視而備戴準確光度眼鏡的，眼睛不至再加深。</p>
<p>修養</p>
<h3>努力本位</h3>
<p>— 神鷹</p>
<p>在人事方面，現在不滿意的事情也太多了，但是不滿意人的地方，是消極的，不滿意自己的地方，那才是積極的。</p>
<p>自己有什麼缺陷，自己有什麼應當改善之處，我們如果能這樣虛心着檢討着自己，那麼我想一定比了「憤世嫉俗」，有了更多的益處。</p>
<p>經過了這一次大戰亂，那裏便會一步就跨入了康莊的大道呢？我們痛定思痛，要改善一個社會，要復興一個國家，責任在每一個人民身上，這雖不是一個很容易的事情，但也不是一件不可能的事情。我們要牢記着自己的本位，從努力自己本位的工作做起，先把自己份內的事情做好。多數人好了，少數人的不好，自然會立足不牢的。</p>
<p>不要空嚷着不滿意現實了，因為我們就負着改善現實的責任。要改善現實，自己先應檢討着自己。不要忘記了國家的主人翁，你自己就是一個在內。</p>

<h3>人地不宜？</h3>
<p>— 江昭然</p>
<p>「人地不宜」，這是官場中常用的一句話。</p>
<p>要說明這句話，最好是來個比方：某人主治某縣，但他對該縣的人情、風俗、歷史等，一概茫然不知，，所以做起事來，往往不很順利，甚至返　民怨；但該縣長就本質說是好縣長，作為該縣長的主管長官，就該將他調職他縣，以期政通人和。這使是「人地不宜」之語的真義。</p>
<p>但真義歸真義，事實歸事實。不是嗎？據三月間江西各報載：該省新喻縣長宋煒，昨川縣長周澈，黎川縣長朱維漢，崇仁縣長　凌雲等，均欠糧十萬担以上，各該縣的民眾，把他們吿到民政廳長王次甫去，王廳長却把他們由甲縣調乙縣，乙縣調丙縣，理由便都是「人地不宜」。</p>
<p>照此說來，「人地不宜」的古話，是已給「時代」賦予了新內容，簡直成為一般老爺們交相貪污的「盾牌」了！</p>
<p>這「盾牌」，真是漂而亮之，這般老爺們真是聰明極了！</p>
<p>但可惜的是：這「盾牌」是由「時代渣　」　積而成。將來也必為「時代洪流」所衝潰；而「時代洪流」正在開始澎湃，這「盾牌」還能屹立多少時日，該是老爺們的憂慮了！</p>

<h3>冒牌DDT　應予檢舉</h3>
<p>— 文波</p>
<p>近日街上出售冒牌美國貨DDT多種，報紙上（予閱五月廿四日本報第一張第四版本埠新聞）已有予以揭發的。現在把有經騐的專家所提出的冒牌鐵證數則，以作參考，希望衛生當局予以注意，並予檢舉，以免市民上當，同時對真正的DDT失去信心。</p>
<p>（一）市上冒牌DDT，多數是用黃色啤酒瓶裝的。其實美國毒性藥品，都是用綠色或藍色甁裝的，沒有用黃色瓶裝的。</p>
<p>（二）美國的DDT沒有十二兩裝（至少十六兩一「品脫」）。</p>
<p>（三）美國藥品最重說明，而街頭的DDT多無說明。</p>
<p>（四）按照規定，DDT是毒性藥物，標籤上應有Poison（「毒藥」）字樣，可是街頭所賣的多數沒有。</p>
<p>（五）美國商標法規定包裝不得相同，可是街頭所賣的十幾種「美國貨DDT」包裝却沒有多大兩樣。</p>
<p>（六）美國藥品很注重牌號和名字，可是街頭的啤酒牌DDT標籤上的英文拼音大多錯誤。</p>
<p>根據某專家檢騐結果，有些所謂美國貨的DDT，竟幾乎全係火油。其實火油十二兩不到二百元，啤酒瓶一隻也不到一百元，而售價有的竟高至二千五百元。欺騙市民，使無知的市民對科學的信心發生動搖，此種奸商，實在可惡。我們希望市政當局根究到底，把這些假科學之名以騙人發財者置之於法，以儆效尤。</p>

<h3>家庭都是的感想</h3>
<p>— 鷹楊</p>
<p>很早以前我曾讀過美國一個大學教授的一篇短文，「我被革職了！」</p>
<p>他是一位剛直的教授，他對教學非常認真，於是他的班上的學生多數不及格了。學生做出許多輕衊的舉動，他不理他也不在意。</p>
<p>好意的教授向他勸吿：「分數不是金子，何不落得順水人情？」但他認為自己不是對分數吝嗇施捨，他只是希望分數確能作為才智的度量！</p>
<p>校長將他　到辦公室去對他說：「學生的家長控告你，他們的子婦不是來學校受分數的苦刑。」最後訓誡他：「請顧到學校未來的前途，分數放寬些！」</p>
<p>他沒有這樣做，於是他被革職了。</p>
<p>一次偶然的機緣，他到他的一個學生家　去拜訪。他奇怪像這樣富有的家庭，竟會如此　　叫　，收音機放出一些　耳　　的樂調，他　　了，沒有一個莎士比亞戲劇莫扎特樂曲的氣氛，怎能希望訓練出一個莎士比亞和莫扎特呢？</p>
<p>於是他對革職的不幸，　　　　了。</p>
<p>我現在臨着一個同樣的攷騐。我奇怪為什會有這樣相似的環境。當我第一次跨進門時，我曾聽到收音機放出滑稽戲和燥雜音樂片，我彷彿是站在一家百貨商店的門前。當我在教書的時候，隔室的麻將，又在刺激我的神經了。</p>
<p>有一次，我看到我的學生在爭看海派的周報。我吃驚。有人慨嘆黃色新聞流入小學生手裏，這真是一個嚴重問題。我想警察局應該更積極的取締黃色新聞。當時我攷慮勸阻他們是否適合，最後另一種力量迫我如此做了。自然，我不能扳起面孔說教，我嘗試激起他們對文藝的愛好，淡忘這件事。</p>
<p>一星期過去了，我沒看到他們拿同類的書看，可是兩個星期以後，我又看到他們拿起來看了　　這是誰的過錯呢？</p>
<p>黃色新聞難道比具有吸引嗎？可是誰也知道黃色新聞對一個未成熟青年不良的刺激啊</p>

<h3>Shenyang Circles Joint Commemoration Week, Chairman Chiang Personally Delivers Admonitory Address, Instructs on Three Principles for the Revival of the Northeast</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Shenyang 27th dispatch] It has been raining in Shenyang recently, then it clears up, and after the clearing, there is wind and sand. The streets of the city are exceptionally clean, as if they have been specially cleaned for the head of state. The head of state holds meetings, gives admonitory speeches, inspects, and receives guests in Shenyang every day, and has almost no free time. On the 26th, he gathered military officers for a roll call and admonitory speech, which lasted for two and a half hours. On the morning of the 27th, at the expanded commemoration week for all circles, he again gave a very long admonitory speech. People in the Northeast all praise the head of state's spirit and physical strength as extraordinary. In addition to paying attention to women's and children's work, Madame Chiang is quite interested in the local customs and conditions, and does not hesitate to work hard and personally conduct on-the-spot investigations, which is praised by many.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Shenyang 27th dispatch] After Chairman Chiang arrived in Shenyang, he was extremely concerned about the revival of the Northeast's industries. On the morning of the 27th, he summoned Wang Jiazhen, the chairman of the Economic Committee of the Northeast Headquarters and the director of the Northeast Production Administration. Wang reported on the establishment and work guidelines of the Northeast Production Administration. Chairman Chiang instructed that the revival of the Northeast's industries is not only the foundation for the revival of the Northeast but also the foundation for the construction and revival of the entire country, and efforts must be made to carry it out. If any difficulties are encountered, they should be reported immediately, and solutions will be sought.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The joint commemoration week for all circles in Shenyang was held at 9:30 a.m. on the 27th in the auditorium of the provincial government. More than a thousand representatives from various party, government, and military agencies in the city attended. Chairman Chiang personally presided over the event and delivered an impromptu admonitory speech, saying in brief: I came to the Northeast in the third year of the Republic of China and it has been thirty-two years since then. Coming here again this time, I have many feelings. The Northeast is the lifeline of our country. It has been occupied for fifteen years. Now that our territory has been restored, after we take over, we should wash away the accumulated shame and work hard on construction so as not to let down the martyrs who sacrificed themselves to protect and recover the Northeast. The Northeast is the most industrially developed region in our country, but it is dilapidated after the war. The way to restore it should not rely solely on machinery, but should follow the teachings of the Premier [Sun Yat-sen] that "hands are omnipotent." (1) Use the vast human resources of the Northeast to rebuild. If our civil and military officials can lead by example, the people of the Northeast will be happy to serve. (2) The people of the Northeast have been subjected to long-term oppression by the enemy, so their concept of the nation and the people is particularly strong, and their social organization is tight and their economic foundation is solid. If the government can guide them according to the circumstances, implement the new county system, and promote local autonomy, the Northeast will surely become a practical experimental zone for the Three Principles of the People. (3) The people of the Northeast have two major advantages, namely diligence and thrift. If they can achieve speed and certainty in the future to make up for the shortcomings of slowness and superficiality, then after the transformation of the spiritual aspect, it will surely promote the rapid development of material construction. Finally, Chairman earnestly instructed military and political personnel to cherish the people, and at the same time hoped that the people of the Northeast would contribute money and effort to assist the government in order to seek their own happiness and the stability of the Northeast.</p>
<h3>Chairman and Madame Host a Gathering for All Circles in Shenyang, Encouraging Unity of Purpose to Build the Northeast</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Shenyang 27th dispatch] Chairman Chiang and Madame hosted a tea party for local gentry and people from all walks of life in Shenyang at 4 p.m. on the 27th in the city government auditorium. More than 300 people attended. The auditorium was simply decorated, and those invited to attend enthusiastically participated, considering it an supreme honor. At 3:45, the Chairman and Madame traveled by car from the Executive Headquarters to the city government. The streets were densely packed with citizens, who stood and looked up at the Chairman and Madame. At 4:00 p.m., the Chairman, accompanied by Madame and Deputy Chief of Staff Bai, entered the auditorium amidst thunderous applause, responding with smiles. They then took their seats and invited the guests to partake of tea and refreshments. At 4:20, the Chairman stood up and delivered a sincere speech, moving all who listened. At the end of the speech, the entire audience responded with the warmest applause. Gentry representatives Zhang Ziwen and Sun Zhonghe delivered welcoming speeches. When Zhang described the tragic situation during the enemy puppet era and the kindness of the Chairman and Madame's visit to the Northeast today, he was moved to tears, and the Chairman and Madame were also deeply moved. Chen earnestly requested the Chairman to rescue elementary education in the Northeast and requested that the Chairman approve the renaming of Shenyang as a special municipality. The Chairman listened and nodded frequently. Finally, the Chairman said with a smile that the central government would handle the issues raised by everyone. After the meeting, students from the Siwei Drama Elementary School presented flowers and performed the opera "Killing Yan Liang". The Chairman and Madame greatly appreciated and praised the children's skillful performance. Starting at 5:00 p.m., the area outside the city government was crowded with people. When the Chairman and Madame left the city government by car, the citizens cheered thunderously. The Chairman's speech briefly stated: Ladies and gentlemen, compatriots from all walks of life, it is indeed a rare opportunity for my wife and I to meet with you in Shenyang today. Recalling the fall of Shenyang on September 18, 1931, fifteen years ago, the central government was unable to provide timely assistance because it was unprepared, causing our compatriots in the Northeast to suffer oppression from the enemy puppets and live a long life of pain in deep waters. Today, gathering together, reflecting on the pain, I still feel very regretful. Now that the Northeast has been liberated and our compatriots in the Northeast have returned to the embrace of the motherland, when I meet with you today, I have a simple hope, that is, I hope that our compatriots in the Northeast will remember the pain of past invasions and oppression by foreign races and the difficulty of obtaining our freedom and independence, and from now on, we will be united, work together with one heart and one mind, strive diligently, and bury ourselves in hard work to build our Northeast, as our responsibility to build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People, and it is also the earnest expectation of compatriots across the country for you.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Representatives in Nanjing Form Groups to Study the Constitution</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing 27th dispatch] The preparatory meeting secretariat of the National Assembly has recently formulated detailed measures for studying the constitution. The measures stipulate that it will be divided into nine groups, and the issues studied by each group are as follows: Group 1: General Principles; Group 2: People's Rights and Obligations; Group 3: National Assembly; Group 4: Central Government; Group 5: Local System; Group 6: National Economy; Group 7: Education; Group 8: Implementation and Amendment of the Constitution; Group 9: Others.

<h3>Gu Weijun in Beiping Says Britain Will Return Hong Kong and Kowloon</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Beiping 27th dispatch] Ambassador Gu is currently a distinguished guest in the ancient capital, and has been busy in recent days socializing with friends from military and political circles. Today, he took time to visit the Summer Palace. Tomorrow, Cai Wenzhi, the Chief of Staff of the Executive Headquarters, will hold a cocktail party at the Beijing Hotel from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. to publicly introduce Mr. Gu to various circles. Mr. Gu told reporters here that he reiterated that Britain should return Kowloon and Hong Kong, and it will only be a matter of time, and it will not be too long, because Britain's foreign policy after the war, especially its colonial policy, has greatly changed. For example, India and Ceylon have been granted a high degree of autonomy, even independence. Britain's attitude towards Kowloon and Hong Kong will not be an exception, and British public opinion generally advocates that the Hong Kong and Kowloon issue should be resolved as soon as possible, because Britain is facing many difficulties both internally and externally, and has no time to take care of Hong Kong and Kowloon.</p>
<h3>Northern Jiangsu is Peaceful and Secure Recently, No Need to Worry</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Zhenjiang 27th dispatch] Northern Jiangsu is peaceful recently. Reports state that some communist troops besieged Yangtai, and more than 2,000 infiltrated the Beijing-Shanghai line, attempting to create disturbances. When reporters inquired about this news from responsible officials from all parties, most believed that it was due to excessive nervousness, and unanimously stated that the security of both southern and northern Jiangsu is solid, and with the current situation, it can be guaranteed that there is no need to worry. On the eve of the implementation of the agreement to cease propaganda warfare, it is hoped that everyone will pay attention with a calm mind. Public opinion will naturally have a fair judgment on the issues in northern Jiangsu, and it is firmly believed that the day of a reasonable solution is not far away.</p>

<h3>Behind-the-Scenes Election Activities in Wuhan, Joint Exposure by Various Newspapers</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Hankou 27th dispatch] The election of Wuhan city councilors was hastily concluded yesterday. The election was held in thirty districts, and the order at each venue was extremely chaotic. The district chiefs, Bao chiefs, and scribes monopolized the election, and there were all kinds of malpractices. Yang Hailong, the district chief of Zhongshan District, even beat and insulted citizens and detained reporters, creating all kinds of illegal activities. The newspapers here have specially decided to publish a "joint dispatch" to expose the behind-the-scenes activities in detail, which is truly a new era in news reporting.</p>

<h3>National Army Consolidates the Periphery of Changchun, Progressing Smoothly Towards the Northwest</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Beiping 27th dispatch] A certain military expert said: The current activities of the National Army advancing beyond Changchun are only to consolidate the periphery of Changchun. The rumors that they are heading straight for Harbin are still premature. Last night, the advance report received here stated that the National Army is advancing towards Yongji from two routes, one route pointing west from Changchun, and the other route pointing north from Hailong. Yongji and Changchun are only a short distance apart. If Yongji is captured, the threat to the east side of Changchun can be eliminated. The National Army advancing north along the China Chang Railroad has already advanced into Dehui. After the battle of Sipingjie, the communist troops no longer have any large-scale organized resistance, so the National Army is advancing smoothly. A spokesperson told reporters that the matter of advancing into Harbin is still pending.</p>
<p>[United News Agency Shenyang 27th dispatch] General Du [Yuming] said yesterday: The National Army is continuing to advance north of Changchun and has reached Jiutai, 50 kilometers northeast of Changchun, and Wanbaoshan, 30 kilometers northwest. The progress of the National Army along the Shenyang-Harbin line is still unknown. Anshan is the center of the steel manufacturing industry, 80 kilometers south of Shenyang. It was recovered by the National Army in April. The current situation is quite chaotic. 5,000 communist troops attacked from the east, and a portion of them entered the city on the 25th of this month. Railway traffic between Shenyang and Yingkou has been suspended since the 26th.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Beiping 27th dispatch] Today, a telegram from the war zone command stated that the National Army under General Du Yuming occupied Dehui, 50 li northeast of Changchun, yesterday without firing a single shot, and has now advanced to within 94 li of Harbin. The communist army under General Lin Biao is avoiding contact with the vanguard of the National Army. At the same time, Du Yuming's army launched a surprise attack from the rear of Sipingjie and occupied Hailong, an important stronghold 90 li southwest of Jilin, 90 li east of Sipingjie. Therefore, the pressure on Jilin City has already increased.</p>
<p>[Reuters Nanjing 27th dispatch] According to recent news, the vanguard of the Northeast Central Army is only 25 li away from Harbin and may reach Harbin within 48 hours.</p>
<h3>Tian Gengxin Will Take Office as Archbishop of Beiping</h3>

According to this newspaper's reporter, although the Organizational Law of the Ministry of National Defense has not yet been submitted to the Legislative Yuan, it is expected to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for discussion at the 301st meeting of the Legislative Yuan to be held in the upper part of next month. The current pending issue of the Ministry of National Defense is only the important personnel below the minister and vice ministers. This issue will not be delayed for long.

The business of the Army General Headquarters has now ended, and the relevant matters of troop deployment and relocation are temporarily handled by the General Staff Headquarters. The military situation that must be announced will be temporarily discussed and reported by the war news release team of the General Staff Headquarters for public announcement.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper Nanjing 27th dispatch] General Bai Chongxi may return to Nanjing at the end of this month to take up the new position of Minister of National Defense.

<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing 27th dispatch] The new Philippine President Roxas will take office in Manila on May 28. The Philippine Independence Ceremony is scheduled for July 4. Chairman Chiang sent a special telegram of congratulations. The telegram is as follows: "To President Roxas on the auspicious occasion of the presidency, I hereby send a telegram of congratulations and wish you boundless success in your new endeavors.

<h3>Xu Yongchang Visits Marshall, Representatives of the Democratic League Staying in Shanghai Will Go to Nanjing Today</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Nanjing 27th dispatch] The Meilun special plane used by the Chairman has flown from Nanjing to Shenyang last week. According to people in the National Government, the Chairman will return to Nanjing soon. After the Chairman arrived in Shenyang, he was concerned day and night about the effect of military mediation in Guannei and the situation of the political consultative talks in Nanjing and Shanghai. It is heard that late at night on the 25th, he drafted and sent detailed telegrams to Nanjing with instructions. It is also heard that in the past three days, Chairman and Marshall have exchanged inquiries and exchanged opinions. It is heard that when Minister Xu Yongchang and his military aide Pi visited Envoy Marshall today, they talked about the Chairman's return date. After the Central Memorial Week was held today, government representatives held a preparatory meeting to promote the talks. The Communist Party representatives seemed to still be obsessed with propaganda, and their efforts to cease fire were clearly "more focused on the verbal arena than the military arena", focusing on propaganda for a ceasefire. According to responsible persons of the Central Propaganda Department, the Communist Party is still insisting on the consensus of the three parties regarding the method of publicizing the ceasefire. In fact, if the military arena cannot stop fighting, everything will be in vain. In terms of the activities of all parties today, it seems that they are still fighting each other. Long Yunji of the Democratic League will come to Nanjing soon. Important figures from various parties staying in Shanghai will also come to Nanjing at the end of the month, but all the decisions on the major premises must wait until the Chairman returns to Nanjing before they can be launched.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Nanjing 27th dispatch] The government representative of the Military Three-Person Team, General Xu Yongchang, Minister of Military Affairs, visited Special Envoy Marshall today. This is Xu's first conversation with Marshall in more than ten days, but Marshall continues to negotiate individually with Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai on the other hand. Today's conversation between Xu and [Marshall] reportedly involved many aspects of the Northeast situation. Xu stated that the government urgently hopes for an improvement in the situation and will do its best to seek an early solution to the problem. The date of the reopening of the Military Three-Person Team meeting has not yet been determined, but people close to the government expect it to be soon.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper news] It is learned that Zhang Jun[unclear], Huang Yanpei, Liang Shuming, Zhang Bojun, and Shen Jun[unclear], representatives of the Democratic League staying in Shanghai, held a meeting yesterday morning and decided to go to Nanjing together at 9:00 a.m. today. According to a [unclear] person in the Democratic League, the representatives of the Democratic League have been staying in Shanghai for a long time and feel quite estranged from the political and human situation in the capital. In order to understand the details of the current political discord, it is necessary to go to Nanjing.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 27th Dispatch] Some individuals here have recently taken a newly optimistic view, believing that the defeat of the Communist troops in the Northeast may influence the future of the Shandong situation, leading to a moderation, and that the Communist troops' offensive actions in Shandong Province may cease in time. However, according to the opinion of a certain military observer, the future of the Shandong situation under the Shandong problem is not entirely optimistic.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 26th Dispatch] Although the battles in various parts of Shandong Province have gradually subsided in recent days, the transfer of Communist troops is still extremely frequent. It is reported that more than 30,000 Communist troops south of Tai'an, except for one route left for the local southern regiments, are all moving towards Jinan. It is also reported that the main force of the 9th Liberation Division and the Self-Defense Corps in the Zichuan area are also moving westward.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 26th Dispatch] The general public here has a rather dim impression of the results of the Jinan Group's negotiations with the Communist troops in Linyi yesterday. They believe that the Communist troops' excuse for refusing to return Mingshui, Longshan, and other places clearly shows a lack of sincerity for peace, and the future of the Shandong situation is still difficult to be optimistic about.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 26th Dispatch] It is reported that there are indeed more than one hundred Soviet military officers in Jiaodong, serving to train the Communist troops' artillery. It is also reported that the Jiaodong Communist troops have three regiments equipped by the Soviet Union, but no concrete evidence has been obtained to date.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 26th Dispatch] Military Intelligence: The movements of the Communist troops are recorded as follows: (1) More than 1,000 men from Zhao's unit of the Bohai Military Region, on the evening of the 20th, fled from Huantai to Changshan, preparing to invade Zhangdian. (2) More than 1,000 men from the 25th Regiment of the 4th Liberation Division and local troops, totaling about 3,000, attacked the Southern Dingguo army positions on the 23rd and are still fighting. (3) The Communist troops in Xi County are all fleeing south, claiming to attack Xuzhou. (4) The stronger forces among the Communist troops and local militia groups in various regions of Southern Shandong are all required to gather north of Tai'an within a time limit, and they also claim to invade Jinan. (5) A unit of the New Fourth Army, about 1,000 men, fled from Tai'an to Wande on the 18th to increase defenses. (6) More than 2,000 men from the 9th Liberation Division and more than 3,000 men from Zhao’s Zhou Security 7th Brigade all moved to the northwest of Zhoucun on the 22nd, with a full plan to attack Zhoucun. (7) 1,000 men from Jia Biao's Security unit were added to Longshan on the 25th, and more than 2,000 men from Yuan Yeli's unit were added to Mingshui.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 26th Dispatch] Communist Troops Fleeing to the National Army: (1) Li, the battalion commander of the 1st Battalion of the 6th Regiment of the Communist Party's New Fourth Army, led more than 50 of his men, two machine guns, and one grenade launcher, from Wujialou in Shan County to surrender to the National Army at 10:00 p.m. on the 18th. Because the details were not kept secret, the regiment discovered the attempt and intercepted them, killing the battalion commander and more than a dozen soldiers. (2) Zhang Xiaoyan, a soldier from the 1st Company of the 2nd Independent Battalion of the Communist Army's 8th Division, surrendered to the 77th Division of the National Army with a rifle and a hand grenade.</p>
<h3>Ye Jianying Returns to Duty; Rehe Group Departs Again</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 27th Dispatch] The situation is showing obvious improvement, and auspicious signs are appearing. Within the Military Mediation Department here, the discord has gradually turned into harmony in the past two days. The impression I got from contacting various parties is that there is still much to be done for the future of the country. Ye Jianying, who had been claiming illness and not coming to the Military Mediation Department for a long time, returned to duty today. Cai Wenzhi told reporters in a happy tone that the situation is indeed gradually brightening both inside and outside the customs. The American Chief and Deputy Chiefs of Staff, in addition to resolving many minor difficulties, are also exchanging information with each other, hoping to promote the development of major issues. The information obtained by intelligence personnel yesterday and today has also obviously changed in nature and rarely contains anything unhelpful or rashly provocative. Their enthusiasm to promote the development of the situation is especially valuable. Many executive groups that were not functioning have recently been sent to Rehe again. The Chengde, Chifeng, and Chaoyang groups have begun effective mediation, and the war in that area has stopped. The situation in Jinan is also not excessively serious. An official said: "These actions of the Communist troops are best regarded as a 'war of nerves.'" Chen Yi has assured the group representatives in Linyi that there will definitely be no problems in Jinan. The conflict in the Pingjinbao triangle area will disappear invisibly as the situation changes.</p>

<h3>Capital's War Trophy Exhibition Hall to Hold Opening Ceremony on the 30th; Grand Scale with Over 3,000 Items on Display</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] The site of the War Trophy Exhibition Hall, organized by the Army Headquarters, is located at the Nanjing Wutaishan War Trophy Ground. It has taken only forty days to transport over three thousand items from various war zones, which are now ready for display. It will be open from the 30th of this month and is divided into four exhibition rooms.

The third room is divided into (1) Engineering Equipment Section, (2) Ordnance Section, which is further divided into ammunition, gun and artillery equipment, and instrument categories, (3) Provisions and Clothing Section, which is divided into clothing and provisions categories, and (4) Communications Equipment Section. The fourth room is (1) Medical Equipment Section, and (2) National Treasures Section. This room, in addition to displaying ancient paintings and national treasures from the Tang, Song, and Ming dynasties that were stolen by the Japanese invaders, is extremely precious. These treasures were left by the Japanese in the Shanghai Peace Museum after the victory and were specially moved to Nanjing for display. There are many airplanes, artillery pieces, and tanks on display in the open air, and the scale is extremely grand. On the morning of the 29th, Commander-in-Chief He will preside over the ceremony to comfort the spirits of the anti-Japanese war martyrs. In the afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Nanjing press will be invited for a preliminary tour. The exhibition will be open to the public from the 30th, at which time Commander-in-Chief He will preside over the opening ceremony and his wife will cut the ribbon to inaugurate the event.</p>

<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Announced at the Memorial Week: We Agree to Conclude a Four-Power Pact; Seek a Reasonable Solution to the Sino-Soviet Problem in the Northeast</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] The Central Memorial Week was held at 9:00 AM on the 27th. Chairman Chiang did not return due to his visit to Shenyang and was chaired by President Yu Youren of the Executive Yuan. Foreign Minister Wang Shijie reported on recent diplomatic developments, divided into the following six items: (1) The recent proceedings of the United Nations Security Council, (2) The Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference, (3) The Japanese issue, (4) The withdrawal of Chinese troops stationed in Vietnam, (5) The Northeast problem, and (6) Other international events. When Wang reported on the Japanese issue, he said: "After careful study and consideration of the proposal by the US Secretary of State to conclude a four-power pact between China, the US, the Soviet Union, and the UK to prevent Japan from rearming and invading again, our government replied to the US government on May 17, agreeing with this policy." Regarding the Northeast problem, Minister Wang said: "The Chinese government will definitely base its policy and friendly spirit to seek a reasonable solution to all issues between China and the Soviet Union and hopes that the leaders of the Soviet government will work with the same spirit according to our efforts." Regarding the withdrawal of Chinese troops stationed in Vietnam, Wang said: "Our troops stationed in Vietnam have been gradually withdrawn and returned to the country and are scheduled to be completely withdrawn within two weeks. One division waiting for ships to Japan in Haiphong will set off for Japan as soon as the ships arrive." The French government has agreed to strictly order the French military and political agencies in Vietnam to grant Chinese people all protections in accordance with the new treaty. The new Sino-French treaty has been approved by both governments, and we sincerely hope that the French-Vietnamese negotiations can achieve satisfactory results. Finally, Minister Wang said: "The Philippines will become independent on July 4, and the British government has declared that it will grant India complete independence. We admire the foresight of the US and British governments in these two events. If the 400 million people of India can also achieve independence and democracy in a peaceful manner like the people of the Philippines and maintain their unity, this is not only a blessing for the people of India but also a major guarantee for peace and prosperity in Asia."</p>
<h3>China Suffered the Most from Japanese Devastation; Reparations Should Begin Sooner; Concrete Plan Carried by Zhu Shiming</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie reviewed the current international situation and diplomatic situation at the Central Memorial Week today. Wang first reviewed the proceedings of the recent Security Council held by the United Nations in New York and the Four Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris, recognizing that although the two meetings faced many difficult problems, our country was determined to stand on the side of justice and fairness, directly or indirectly, to promote their success. Mentioning the issue of Allied control of Japan, Minister Wang next announced that our government had issued a reply on May 17, agreeing to a new US proposal, that is, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and China conclude a treaty with Japan for a period of 20 to 25 years. The content of which is the same as the US, British, Soviet, and French treaty with Germany that the United States intended to propose but did not, so as to thoroughly limit the resurgence of aggression by both Germany and Japan. Wang also reported separately that since our country formally dispatched representatives to the Allied Committee on Japan, our government's position on the Japanese issue has been greatly respected by all parties. The relevant government departments are currently forming concrete plans on the issues of protecting overseas Chinese and reparations. The latter has been carried to Japan by General Zhu Shiming, who recently returned to the country. The content is to request the Allied Committee on Japan to obtain the request of our government to start the Japanese reparations to China earlier before the plan of the Japanese reparations plan prepared by the committee is implemented. China was devastated the most by Japan, and currently needs reparations in order to recover, which is especially pressing. In addition, Foreign Minister Wang announced the following points in the report: (1) The dispatch of Chinese troops stationed in Japan is about to depart. This is to fulfill international obligations and there is absolutely no intention to show off force against Japan. (2) The Soviet Union replied on May 23 to our note of May 10 that the Soviet troops in the Northeast have been completely withdrawn. Negotiations on Sino-Soviet economic cooperation in the Northeast cannot begin temporarily before the sovereignty of the Northeast is completely restored. Our government still consistently believes that the industrial equipment of Japan in the Northeast is not a war trophy, but compensation. (3) France has respected our proposal to protect overseas Chinese in Vietnam, and the National Army in northern Vietnam is expected to be completely withdrawn by June 10. (4) The Philippines officially became independent on July 4, which is a major commemorative event in Asia, and it is expected that its impact will extend to the entire Asia. (5) After the British Cabinet delegation went to India, the British-Indian talks have made considerable new progress. We certainly hope for a satisfactory solution as in the Philippines.</p>
<h3>Draft of Entry and Exit Registration Law for Beijing Completed</h3>

<h3>Chairman Concerned About Food Shortage in Guangdong Province; Relief Measures Handed Over to the Executive Yuan for Approval; Grain and Commodity Prices in Guangdong Gradually Declining</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 27th Dispatch] The food shortage in Guangdong is serious, and Chairman Chiang is also extremely concerned. Representatives of the National Assembly, senators, and provincial and municipal councils of this province have jointly drafted relief measures for the food shortage in Guangdong and telegraphed them to Chairman Chiang for adoption. A reply telegram has now been received, agreeing to hand them over to the Executive Yuan for approval. The original telegram is as follows: (Titles omitted) "I have received the telegram of May 4 regarding the solution to the food shortage in Guangdong and the proposed relief measures have been handed over to the Executive Yuan for earnest approval, Chiang Kai-shek, 17th Year, delivered from Beijing."</p>
<p>Also, current grain prices here have gradually declined. The price of high-quality rice is 55,000 yuan per stone. According to Mr. He Jiping, chairman of the Provincial General Chamber of Commerce, the past surge in grain prices was, of course, partly due to human factors, but the recent reports from various counties on the shortage of rice sources and thus the psychological stimulation of grain prices were the main factors. Now that there has been welcome rain in various rivers and the elimination of the phenomenon, there is hope for a harvest, so grain prices have naturally fallen. According to general observations, grain prices may fall to 40,000 yuan, while other daily necessities such as cloth are also gradually falling due to the increasing number of visitors.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hengyang, 27th Dispatch] According to a reliable investigation and statistics, there are nearly 30,000 refugees in the Hengyang urban area and more than 300,000 in the rural areas.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Upholding New Principles of International Law</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the United Press continued Reuter's telecommunication, stating that six months ago, twenty-one senior members of the German Socialist Party began their trial by the United Nations on charges such as launching a war. Few of those participating in the trial knew how long the proceedings would last when the case began. If the indictments by various countries were strictly limited to war crimes and the massacre of millions of civilians in Europe, the trial period could be greatly shortened. However, the United Nations, during this trial, will create an environment where those who overthrow recognized international law and treaties and carry out aggressive warfare, whether intentional or not, are included. In essence, the United Nations intends to prove that those who carry out aggressive warfare are guilty, and those in power who support the launch of aggressive warfare are also guilty. The entire apparatus that aids aggression, including the German cabinet and General Staff, is considered a criminal organization. This massive plan has led to the prolongation of the trial. The trial in Nuremberg is ongoing and has not yet concluded. It is naturally impossible to predict what the verdict of the Nuremberg International Tribunal will be in the future. However, based on the prosecutor's indictment and current indications, the trial in Nuremberg is based on the aforementioned principle that those who launch and support aggression are guilty, and the entire apparatus that aids aggression is a criminal organization. This is a new principle in international law. To ensure lasting peace in the future, we support this new principle.</p>
<p>In recent days, American Judge Keene and Chinese Judge Dr. Mei Ruao from the Tokyo International Military Tribunal for the Trial of Japanese War Criminals are traveling from Tokyo to China. We still remember when the trial of Japanese war criminals began in Tokyo earlier this month, the defendants' defense lawyers attempted to impeach the qualifications of the judges, limit the power of the court, reduce the charges, and even attempt to fundamentally overturn the court, so that the Japanese war criminals could escape justice. Now, taking the opportunity of the visit of the American and Chinese judges of the Tokyo International Military Tribunal passing through Shanghai, we would like to contribute our views on the trial of Japanese war criminals.</p>
<p>First, all attempts by the Japanese war criminals' defense lawyers, such as fundamentally overturning the structure of the Tokyo International Military Tribunal or limiting its power, should be fundamentally refuted. In the statements of the Japanese war criminals' defense lawyers, they even mentioned that the Potsdam Declaration was a conditional surrender, which is different from the collapse of Nazi Germany. Germany could have a trial of "war criminals," but Japan, according to these lawyers, does not have "war criminals." Even if there are so-called "war criminals," they are limited to what was recognized by international law at the time, such as killing civilians and mistreating prisoners of war, and do not include those who implement national policies. They also said that the charges of launching a war of aggression and causing disaster to humanity are not found in the international law at the time, nor in the Potsdam Declaration. Therefore, even if the existence of the Tokyo International Military Tribunal itself is not questioned, it can only try general war crimes recognized by international law at the time, such as killing civilians and mistreating prisoners of war. All these attempts, while ostensibly protecting the rights of the defendants, have political significance that outweighs judicial significance. The purpose is to publicly declare and record in official documents that Japan's surrender was conditional, not unconditional. Although the Tokyo International Military Tribunal is a military legal institution, it should not pay attention to political considerations. However, all previous public announcements since the war against Japan, such as the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration itself, are binding international legal documents. Japan's surrender was completely unconditional. All the lawyers' attempts should be unhesitatingly and rigorously refuted according to the law.</p>
<p>Second, to ensure lasting world peace, we sincerely support this new principle of international law, which is that all those who initiate, execute, and support aggression are guilty, and the entire apparatus that aids aggression, including the cabinet and the General Staff, is a criminal organization. International law is originally a living law that grows and develops with changes in the international situation. The past distinctions between combatants and non-combatants, and the limitations on indiscriminate bombing, have become ineffective due to the use of new weapons and new tactics. If this new principle of international law, that those who launch aggression are guilty and the institutions that aid aggression are criminal organizations, is not established in this atomic age, how can future international order be stabilized? The outdated view of war, that war is a continuation of a country's policies and is not inherently a crime, is no longer applicable in this atomic age. Launching a war of aggression is inherently a crime and should be subject to legal sanctions. The establishment of this principle will greatly benefit the maintenance of future international order. To uphold this principle, we feel that the current number of twenty-eight Japanese war criminals on trial in Tokyo is too small. There are indeed some well-known Japanese war criminals who are the masterminds of aggression who are still at large. If they are not brought to justice, how can this new principle of international law be established? We hope that the twenty-eight war criminals on trial are only the first batch of Japanese war criminals to be tried, and that there will be more masterminds of aggression who will be tried and sanctioned by international law.</p>
<p>Third, China has suffered the longest and most severe aggression from Japan. China can submit a large list of war criminals, all of whom are the masterminds of aggression against China. However, since the Tokyo International Military Tribunal is an international tribunal for trials, it may make its work more complicated. China already has military courts that have begun trials. Japanese war criminals who invaded China, whether in Japan or elsewhere, should, if not tried by the Tokyo International Military Tribunal, be arrested and extradited to Chinese courts as soon as possible according to the list provided by the Chinese government, to await sanctions.</p>
<p>After the Second World War, and with the advent of the atomic age, mankind should establish a new international order, which is the abandonment of force and its replacement with international rule of law. To establish this rule-of-law international society, the principle that launching aggression is a crime must first be established. This is why we place earnest hopes on the trials in Nuremberg, and especially in Tokyo.</p>

Although 38 cocoon purchasing manufacturers have registered with the silkworm improvement area, it is predicted by relevant parties that they may not be able to fully open their scales at that time. This is because some cocoon merchants do not meet the conditions and have not been able to obtain funds from the silkworm company. They also have hidden worries about the security and guarding of the four rural areas. In addition, the cocoon price is high, and the cost is calculated, which is bound to lead to losses. Therefore, the cocoon merchants have been somewhat hesitant in recent days, and about 30 to 40% have voluntarily given up. It is expected that the actual number of cocoon merchants who will open their scales to purchase cocoons will be less than 30. In addition, the Silkworm Improvement Area of this county, in order to strictly manage the cocoon trade in accordance with regulations and plan to collect fees for silkworm improvement projects, has been handling the following two matters since the 25th. 1. Manufacturers who decide to purchase cocoons shall pay a deposit of 3,000 yuan per dan according to the planned purchase quantity. 2. Unregistered cocoon firms that engage in retail drying and retail purchasing of fresh cocoons shall all register with the area. If any cocoon firm is found to be privately purchasing cocoons or engaging in retail drying, they shall be severely punished.</p>
<p>Jintan: Police Officers Commit Adultery and Break the Law</p>
<p>Wang Wenzhi, a member of the police station in this county, has been repeatedly seeking prostitutes at inns by virtue of his position. On the night of the 11th, he went to the Zhongnan Inn at No. 65 Hua Street, under the pretext of staying there, and forcibly raped Ji Dasao, a female employee of the inn. Ji did not dare to speak out because she was afraid of his power. Unexpectedly, the police officer became even more absurd, disregarding the law. A few days ago, he held a short gun and threatened Chen Rongsheng, the owner of the inn, forcing Chen to provide his wife, Chen Songshi, for him to sleep with. After Chen sternly rebuked him, the police officer became angry out of shame and beat Chen severely to vent his anger before leaving. When the news spread, the whole county was shocked. After suffering such unreasonable humiliation, Chen could no longer bear it and publicly presented a report to the county government and the county party headquarters women's association, requesting protection. After receiving the report, the county government believed that the police officer knew the law and violated the law and harmed social morals. Wang Wenzhi was arrested and interrogated by trial officer Zhu Tujing. Zhu Dasao also testified in court. The defendant could not deny it and admitted the truth. The court ordered him to be remanded and interrogated again on the 27th.</p>
<p>Gaochun: Building a Dike in Xiangtan, Assaulting and Injuring People</p>
<p>In the Xihu Township in the southwest of the lake area, there is the Danyang Lake Beach, which is a joint border area between Jiangsu and Anhui. During the period of the Japanese occupation, an organization called "Limin Kenwu Company" was established, with thousands of workers, all of whom were aliens, building dikes. The project has not been completed. This spring, the company resumed building dikes. The dike area covers about 70,000 mu. However, there are 108 weirs nearby. Due to the mountain floods and the overflowing river water, there is no slow-flowing reservoir. Every year, there is a risk of flooding. The Chun Water Conservancy Committee sent personnel to negotiate before, but it was not approved. Therefore, on May 18, the farmers of the township, seeing that the matter was related to their lives, wanted to stop it. Unexpectedly, a conflict broke out at that time, and both sides used force to fight, resulting in several deaths and injuries. After receiving the report, the county government immediately sent the county security squadron to take the murderers and the injured to the county for legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Taixing: The Communist Army is Very Active in Tai County</p>
<p>The Communist army in the four suburbs of this county is working more and more intensively. In addition to the routine kidnapping, extortion, and looting of people's wealth, and the killing of people, they have recently increased the number of troops and are very active in the third, fourth, and fifth districts and Huangqiao and other places. According to reliable sources, the Communist army's political workers have recently been forcibly levying two cotton quilts and one door panel from each bao in each township, as well as one tall bamboo ladder, in preparation for combat. If anyone refuses to comply, they will be treated as violating military orders and "killed." On the one hand, they concentrate the militia team and assign the militia two tasks: (1) Organize a harvesting team to rush to harvest wheat seedlings in various border areas and universally arm for defense. (2) Organize a sabotage team to sabotage highways on the Chenghuang and Jinghuang lines, causing traffic between Chenghuang to be cut off, and there are no pedestrians. Heavy troops are also deployed around the Shili Temple outside the east of the city, where the national army is stationed, and landmines are buried, in an attempt to attack our county town.</p>
<p>Hefei: The Ministry of Finance Lists the Province's Revenue</p>

<h3>One Wave Subsides, Another Rises: US Coal Miners Strike; Truman's Negotiations with Lewis Fail to Reach an Agreement; Powerful Members of the Senate Oppose Granting Special Privileges to the President</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] San Francisco, 27th Broadcast: Industrial unrest in the United States, one wave subsiding, another rises. Although the railway strike last week has ended, the United States is now facing another industrial crisis. All workers in the bituminous coal mines, which have already been taken over by the government, went on strike today, challenging President Truman.</p>
<p>Another report: Powerful parties in the US Senate today rejected granting President Truman emergency powers to deal with any labor unrest that opposes the government. However, government leaders are confident that they can break the opposition's power next week.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington, 26th, United Press] This morning at 4:00 AM (Greenwich Mean Time), the US government returned the railways it had taken over on the 17th to private operation.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 26th] President Truman negotiated with Coal Miners Union President Lewis at the White House today in a last-minute effort to avert the strike, but no agreement was reached. Interior Secretary Krug is scheduled to continue negotiations with Lewis tomorrow.</p>
<p>[United Press New York, 26th] National Maritime Union President Curran announced today that regardless of what legislation Congress passes, the general strike of national maritime workers will proceed as scheduled on June 15. However, at that time, the Maritime Union will still maintain legal bargaining and troop transports will continue to operate as usual. The seven national maritime unions have a total of 200,000 members. Curran made this speech to the Industrial Organizations Federation Standing Committee, which represents 600,000 workers in New York City. The meeting also passed a resolution calling for the overturning of President Truman's bill to fine and punish strikers.</p>
<p>[French News Agency Washington, 26th] After President Truman proposed a bill to ban illegal strikes and suppress labor unions, the railway unions expressed indignation. Tinei, chairman of the Car Workers Union, said here today: If Truman does not want to participate in the 1948 presidential election, then so be it. If he wants to participate, then this union will not hesitate to spend its entire reserve of $47 million to oppose Truman's election. This union is the richest union in the world and will use all its resources to fight against the members of Congress who support the president's bill.</p>
<h3>Molotov's Speech Explains Soviet Attitude; Reaffirms Opposition to Convening a 21-Nation Peace Conference Before an Agreement is Reached Among the Great Powers</h3>
<p>[United Press London, 27th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today denied that Chairman Stalin had agreed to the suggestion of US Secretary of State Byrnes for a 25-year treaty with Germany and issued a warning that if Byrnes insists on convening a peace conference before conditions are ripe, the relationship among the four powers may deteriorate. Molotov claimed that Britain and the United States are using economic assistance as a means to try to control Italy and other countries, so that these countries can become tools for further promoting capitalist policies. He said that Britain and the United States should be held responsible for the failure of the Paris Conference and pointed out that the United States is assisting Britain in maintaining its monopoly in the Mediterranean, and that the two countries had agreed in advance to jointly deal with the Soviet Union's .</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 27th] Moscow Telegraph quoted a speech made by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to the press today, explaining the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference, which stated: Certain countries obviously want to impose their will on others. Certain factions in the United States, with the help of their British friends, want to establish a chain of naval and air bases all over the world. However, during the war, at the Yalta, Tehran, and Potsdam Conferences, the views of the participating countries were consistent, and resolutions were established. However, certain countries now obviously want to impose their will on others, and some people have come out to oppose the order among the Allied countries, turning the conference room into a place of debate and quarrel. When the Soviet delegation went to Paris, it was determined to fulfill the resolutions of the Moscow Conference and was unwilling to discuss the treaty until a preliminary agreement was reached among the great powers on the treaty. Although Italy has changed its regime, the Soviet Union cannot regard it as an equal country on the Allied side. Regarding the draft treaties with Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, certain items have now yielded concrete results. The treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Finland can be regarded as drafted and ready, but it is not in the interests of the Danube countries to interfere with the interests of the Danube countries, especially for Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, which cannot be agreed upon. Regarding the issue of Italian reparations, in 1941 and 1942, fascist Italian troops attacked the Soviet Union, destroying many Soviet cities and causing significant losses to our country. Fascist Italian troops also invaded Yugoslavia, Greece, Albania, and other countries, causing them significant losses. However, considering that they established a democratic government in the final stage of the war, which was not without help, we now demand fair compensation in a moderate way. It is impossible not to impose appropriate punishment on Italy. The countries that have not had their territory invaded now believe that the US occupation forces are heavily burdened in Italy, as documented in the Italian newspapers. Therefore, if this expense can be slightly reduced, even by millions of dollars, it can enable Italy to fulfill its claim for compensation to the Soviet Union. We are well aware that the Italian people have insufficient food, but fulfilling the compensation claim will only add to their suffering. The reason why Britain and the United States oppose it is that it will make the two countries help Italy pay this compensation, which is not a pertinent argument. It has not been possible to successfully negotiate the draft peace treaty with Italy, which lacks the harmonious and cooperative understanding of the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam Conferences during the war. The Paris Conference proposed convening a 21-nation peace conference to discuss the draft peace treaties before an agreement was reached. The Soviet delegation believes that this violates the principles of Allied cooperation and therefore rejected it.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Four Foreign Ministers Met in Paris Yesterday to Discuss the French-Italian Border Issue</h3>

<h3>Reported Stalin's Proposal to the US: Negotiate a Treaty of Friendship and Remove the "Iron Curtain" in Central Europe</h3>
<p>(United Press Washington, 26th) According to newspaper columnist Pearson's broadcast today, Marshal Stalin has proposed that the Soviet Union and the United States negotiate a treaty of friendship and remove the "Iron Curtain" stretching across Central Europe. However, State Department officials stated they had no knowledge of this proposal. Pearson stated that Stalin had telegraphed Byrnes, saying that the Soviet Union is now "prepared to discuss all economic matters with the United States at length." He also said Stalin suggested negotiations begin within a month in Washington. According to Pearson, the proposal included discussions on air routes between the US and the Soviet Union, and freedom of navigation on European rivers and ports within Soviet territory. Pearson continued, "Stalin informed Byrnes that the Soviet Union is also prepared to remove the 'Iron Curtain' in Eastern Europe."</p>
<p>(United Press London, 26th) Moscow Radio broadcast today that some people view the world as a large school, with the United States acting as the teacher. This kind of didactic view is unrealistic. Lasting peace requires mutual understanding and cooperation among the three major powers. If actions are based on the intentions of those who seek to dominate the world, the unity of these three powers is unlikely.</p>

<h3>Security Council Tending to Abandon Discussion of the Iranian Question: Iranian Government and Azerbaijan Province to Reopen Negotiations</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] San Francisco, 27th Radio: The Security Council is now tending to abandon discussion of the Iranian question. According to sources close to US representative Stettinius, the US is satisfied with the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Iran. If the situation does not change significantly, the discussion of the Iranian question may be concluded immediately.</p>
<p>[United Press New York, 27th] The United States is awaiting a complete report from its embassy in Iran before deciding whether to disregard Soviet opposition and request the United Nations to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the situation in Iran.</p>
<p>[Reuters Tehran, 27th] The British radio station stated: Negotiations between the Tehran government and the autonomous province of Azerbaijan, which were suspended in Tehran two weeks ago, will reopen soon. The failure of the previous negotiations was due to the vast difference between the Azerbaijani demands for autonomy and the concessions the Tehran government was prepared to make.</p>
<p>Iranian Prime Minister Sadr claimed that the breakdown of the negotiations was due to the three unconstitutional demands made by Azerbaijani Prime Minister Jafar Pishevari, which the central government could not accept. These three demands were: Pishevari to be appointed as the highest administrative officer, to appoint himself as the commander of the gendarmerie, and to distribute land to the peasants.</p>

<h3>Adjusting to New World Strategic Perspective: Readjustment of the British Commonwealth Defense System; Conference of Dominion Prime Ministers Concludes</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 26th] The conference of Dominion Prime Ministers has just concluded. It is reported that they have agreed on a new perspective of world strategy, reforming the traditional British system and adjusting the imperial defense system. The suggestion of distributing industrial materials by imperial leaders and having each region administer its own defense has been overturned. The strategic details discussed are being kept secret by the authorities. However, attendees have made the following three hints: (1) The Mediterranean can no longer remain a "British lake." (2) India, with its 350 million people, was originally a stronghold of the British Empire system, but it may no longer be so in the future. (3) The development of air force and atomic bomb warfare has completely changed the concept of national defense during the Second World War. Therefore, the discussion focused on adapting to this changing situation and conforming to the new world strategy, to be implemented within the Commonwealth system.</p>
<h3>American People's Savings Reach 250 Billion</h3>

<h3>French Troops Cross the Mekong River: Invade Siamese Territory; Capture Longkai, Advancing on Phra Tabong; Franco-Siamese Secret Negotiations Declared a Failure</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] London, 27th Radio: Secret negotiations between France and Siam, which have been going on for two months, focusing on the Siam-Vietnam border issue, have completely failed. The Siamese delegation has departed for Saigon.</p>
<p>[United Press Bangkok, 26th] According to news from the Siamese-Vietnamese border today, 800 French troops, equipped with aircraft and artillery, crossed the Mekong River five miles southeast of Viet Zeng in Vietnam, invading Siamese territory and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with a mixed force of Siamese police and civilians. According to the report, the fighting broke out last Friday. At dawn that day, the first batch of French troops crossed the river five miles southeast of the Viet Zeng occupied area. An hour and a half later, reinforcements arrived, and the French troops began to advance eastward, subsequently capturing Longkai in Siam, with the intention of concentrating on attacking Phra Tabong. The Siamese defense line was forced to retreat ten miles westward.</p>
<p>[Reuters Bangkok, 26th] The Siamese government issued a communiqué today stating that French troops crossed the Mekong River border at two points this morning, occupied Taipo, and advanced towards Journalists' Hill. The Siamese government has lodged a complaint with the United Nations and has requested the intervention of the British and American governments, seeking a peaceful resolution through diplomatic channels. When the French troops invaded, the Siamese police initially resisted, but then retreated inland. French troops bombed Longkai, and French aircraft also conducted reconnaissance deep inside Siam.</p>
<p>According to reports from Bangkok on the 8th of this month, French troops bombed Siam's Nakhon Phanom on the banks of the Mekong River and strafed Thai islands with machine guns. After the incident, the Siamese cabinet convened an emergency meeting and sent a letter of protest to the British and American ministers to Siam to be forwarded to Paris.</p>
<p>Publication of the Contents of Franco-Siamese Negotiations</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Saigon, 27th] French authorities held secret negotiations here with an official Siamese delegation in April this year to discuss the disposition of the Vietnamese territory that Siam forcibly occupied with Japanese assistance in 1941. The content of the negotiations was only released today. At that time, the French authorities demanded that Siam return the provinces of Cambodia and Laos, occupied in 1941, to Vietnam and compensate for the losses suffered by French interests within Siam and the Siamese-occupied areas. However, both parties agreed to consider minor border revisions that would be beneficial to Siam in order to improve river transportation. In addition, both parties reviewed the issue of Siamese minorities within Vietnam.</p>

<h3>Nehru Makes a Statement: India Must Be Completely Independent; Should Have Equal Status with British Dominions; Expresses Deep Regret over the Terrorist Rule in Kashmir</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] London, 27th Radio: Nehru stated today that India must have complete freedom and should enjoy absolute equality with Britain and its Dominions.</p>
<p>[Reuters New Delhi, 27th] After the Maharaja of Kashmir left the Indian state of Kashmir, located at the southern foot of the Himalayas, its chairman Sheikh Abdullah and several leaders were arrested last week as a result. After this incident, Nehru, the chairman of the Congress Party, issued a statement yesterday, saying that assassinations occur daily in Srinagar, the capital of the state, and that women are not spared. Innocent residents are often forced to crawl in the streets and are ordered to remove their headscarves to wipe the ground. The bodies of those killed are not allowed to be claimed by relatives and are soaked in gasoline and burned. The state authorities are using such methods to suppress the people's movement, which is beyond the authority of any government. The Kashmir National Conference and the Indian People's Conference (Nehru himself is the chairman of the Indian People's Conference) have long sought to establish autonomous governments in the Indian states. This objective has gained the support of the people of Kashmir. Unexpectedly, the state government has adopted high-pressure terrorist measures, which is extremely regrettable and should be stopped.</p>

However, the impact on women's diseases is the most peculiar. One pregnant woman lost all her hair but gave birth to a healthy child. At the same time, several women with irregular menstruation were cured by the atomic bomb blast.</p>

<h3>Cessation of Reparations Deliveries in the US Occupation Zone in Germany: US Claims This Move is to Protect the Economy of the Area; Britain and France Will Announce the Same Ban</h3>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 26th] Lieutenant General Clay, Deputy Commander of the US Occupation Zone in Germany, announced tonight that, in order to accelerate the implementation of the Potsdam Agreement and to manage Germany as a whole economically, the United States has decided to stop delivering reparations from its occupation zone, except for factories that have already been allocated. This move by the United States is to protect the economy of the area in order to prevent the permanent non-implementation of the Potsdam Agreement (which is now considered highly likely in some respects), which would lead to Germany being permanently divided into east and west, with the east occupied by the Soviet Union and the west by other United Nations. The ban on movement includes all reparations claims. Britain and France have not yet announced the same ban, but it is generally believed here that they will follow the US lead. The dismantling and shipping of factories allocated within the British occupation zone is slightly behind that of the US occupation zone. In the US occupation zone, about fifteen to twenty factories have been allocated to countries claiming reparations, and these factories will still be completely delivered. The remaining 150 factories available for reparations will not be dismantled and shipped for the time being, but will be disposed of after the following points in the implementation of the Potsdam Agreement have been addressed: 1. Management of Germany as a single economic entity, and the establishment of necessary central institutions; 2. Restoration of Germany's import and export trade, providing credit and loans to pay for imported food and necessary raw materials; 3. Establishment of free international trade to assist the crippled economy of the US occupation zone and prevent the gradual decline of its industrial production again, by using raw materials that the Soviet Union and other occupation zones can supply.</p>

<h3>Japanese Minister of Agriculture Announces Solutions to Alleviate Food Shortage: Increase Production and Maximize Land Use</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 27th] The new Japanese Minister of Agriculture, Wada, told reporters from this agency that he expects Japan to feel a food shortage for a long time to come. During this period, without foreign food imports, no rationing food production can be obtained. Then ask for American assistance. The method to increase production is to confiscate and use the already reclaimed farmland, so that the land can be fully utilized. There are four points to solving the food shortage, namely: (1) Increasing fertilizer production. (2) Saving rationing procedures, (3) Increasing agricultural implement production, (4) Spreading new agricultural technologies. (5) Reforming the land system. (6) Close cooperation with farmers' cooperatives to increase food production.</p>

<h3>Scientists in US Unsure About the Possibility of Making a Cosmic Ray Bomb</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 26th] Scientists here are not very confident about whether it is possible to immediately manufacture a cosmic ray bomb, which is said to be tens of thousands of times stronger than an atomic bomb. The millions of electron volts generated within the cosmic rays obtained from space are indeed stronger than the millions of electron volts of atomic core energy, but from the discovery of the source of cosmic rays to how to generate power to make a bomb, a long process is needed. It is quite meaningful that a cosmic ray recorder will be placed inside the tip of the V-rocket when the first V-rocket is tested in New Mexico next Friday.</p>

<h3>Suppressing Grain Prices: Seven Measures Determined; Encouraging Grain Purchases; Assisting Legitimate Merchants to Reduce Costs; Severely Punishing Unscrupulous Merchants; Hoping for Reports from All Quarters</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, Mayor Wu, Secretary-General He Dekui, Social Affairs Bureau Chief Wu Kaixian, Finance Bureau Gu Chunfan, Social Affairs Bureau Industry and Commerce Section Chief Gu Bingyuan, and others convened a meeting in the Municipal Government Conference Room to encourage the purchase and transport of grain. Present were Du Yuesheng, Wang [name illegible], Xu Ji [name illegible], Feng You [name illegible], Chen Xing, Liu Gongyun, the Executive Yuan representative Wang Renlin, the Grain Administration representative Wang Daren, Shen Deren, the chairman of the Soybean and Rice Industry Association Wan [name illegible], Mi [name illegible] Industry Chen Shao [name illegible], [name illegible] San, [name illegible] Zhenhua, the leader of the pig feed industry [name illegible] Sheng, Gu Yisheng, Zhu Yongming, Xing Zhi [name illegible], the rice shop industry Zhang Xi [name illegible], Yang [name illegible], and others. The Mayor stated: "The government's policy for handling the grain issue is to thoroughly eliminate speculation and strictly prohibit hoarding and profiteering. The transport and procurement of legitimate grain merchants will not only be vigorously protected but also fully encouraged to stabilize grain prices and ensure the people's livelihood. For registered grain stockpiles, those who immediately raise market prices or deliberately wait and see, the chairman of the Soybean and Rice Industry Association Huang Cheng and the relevant leaders of the rice industry should report the facts at any time. The government will severely punish unscrupulous merchants who dare to violate the law and will not be lenient. It is hoped that legitimate rice merchants will consider the people's food needs, do their best to procure and transport grain, and suppress grain prices. We also hope that all parties will report unscrupulous merchants."</p>
<p>Du Yuesheng then continued: "Mayor Wu is concerned about the city's grain situation and has convened this grain meeting for the second time with the aim of suppressing rice prices and encouraging procurement and transport. Since the government has made its greatest efforts in this regard, grain merchants should also act in good conscience and not seek exorbitant profits. At this time when old crops are running out and new crops are not yet in, grain merchants should assist the government. Those who hoard and speculate should be reported without the slightest hesitation. Do not assume that local officials will be lenient or harbor any侥幸 [僥倖] (jiao3xing4: lucky chance; fluke) thoughts.

(4) All legitimate grain merchants in the city who have been examined and qualified by the trade association and have obtained a certificate from the association, and who are truly [name illegible] grain from the producing areas, will be issued a procurement certificate.

<h3>China Suffered the Heaviest Losses in the War; Compensation Proportion Should Naturally Be Higher; Pauley Received Reporters Yesterday; Departs Shanghai for Seoul Today</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Mr. Pauley, the personal representative of U.S. President Truman and commissioner of the Reparations Committee, came to Shanghai from Peiping.

As for Japan's property in China, the U.S. advocates that it should all be used to compensate China. Regarding the [name illegible] [name illegible] of Japanese industrial equipment to China, current regulations stipulate that the [name illegible] [name illegible] costs of reparations materials shipped from Japan are borne by Japan, while after arrival in China, they should be handled by China itself. However, the raw materials and technicians for revitalizing China's industry are quite problematic.</p>
<p>Pauley reported on the objectives of his trip to Northeast China: (1) to assess the production capacity of Northeast industry and the storage of materials; (2) the total amount of Japanese property in Northeast China and the production capacity after the transfer of Japanese industrial equipment to Northeast China. As for the investigation of Japanese-owned properties in northern Korea, the U.S. military is still in negotiations with the Soviet side.

<p>Pauley and his five-person staff left Shanghai by plane yesterday afternoon for Seoul, where they will stay for fifteen days to a month and establish an office there.</p>

<h3>Yuan Ludeng to be Sentenced on the 29th; Writes Will in Prison; Claims He Lived His Life Without Wronging Anyone; Prosecutor Xia Read Aloud the Indictment with Vehemence; After Adjournment, Meets with Family and Children in Mutual Grief</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yuan Ludeng, one of the "Three Elders" of Shanghai, has been tried twice by the Special Criminal Tribunal of the High Court. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, Presiding Judge Xiao and Judges Feng and Wang opened a debate court. In addition to the original three lawyers, Chen Rui, Li Shisen, and Chao Jimei, who were obliged to defend the defendant, the High Court also appointed lawyer Zhang Danping as the designated defender. After submitting more than ten pieces of evidence, an intense debate ensued, lasting one hour and twenty minutes, with the sentencing scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 31st of this month. The defense argued that the defendant's detention has exceeded eight months and requested bail, and the court will file a separate application.</p>
<p>Mentally Depressed, Staggering</p>
<p>When Yuan arrived in court yesterday, he had changed into a gray, unlined long gown, with coffee-colored trousers underneath, black shoes, and white socks. His complexion was paler than before, and the short hair on his forehead was almost entirely white. He appeared mentally depressed and staggered as he walked. Presiding Judge Xiao, therefore, specially provided a wooden chair, instructing him to sit beside the defendant's seat to answer questions. When first asked about the establishment of the Baojia system and the Rice Control Association, Yuan stated that he took on these roles to safeguard the security and sustenance of the Shanghai citizens, driven by a desire to serve society, and certainly not to ingratiate himself with the enemy for personal gain. He also said, "Because I am a businessman, I may not understand the law and may not know that it is a crime, but I have always done things for others and never done anything to harm others for my own benefit, so I have always been considerate of others. Even the defense lawyers this time are all volunteering to defend me." Regarding the "Rice Control Association's" purchase of rice, he testified, "The rice was obtained by us from various places, but each time it was taken away by the Japanese army. When we needed to use it, we had to borrow it from them. In the first three months, we could still borrow it, but later they refused to lend it anymore, and I had no choice but to resign." Lawyers Chen Rui and Chao Jimei presented evidence to defend the employees. At this point, Prosecutor Xia Lili read aloud Yuan's crimes of treason with vehemence, making Yuan unable to look directly at him. After he finished speaking, lawyer Chen Tingrui responded to the charges listed in the indictment, especially regarding the establishment of the Baojia system and the Rice Control Association, with more detailed arguments. The gist of his argument was the same as Yuan's own testimony, so I will not repeat it here. Then, lawyer Zhang defended, listing the inaccuracies of the crimes charged by the prosecutor.</p>
<p>Insists on Surrender, Denies Arrest</p>
<p>Finally, Presiding Judge Xiao asked Yuan again, "Is there anything else you want to say?" Yuan solemnly denied being arrested, strongly asserting that he surrendered himself. The court debate concluded, and sentencing was scheduled for the 29th of this month. After the adjournment, Yuan requested to see his family, and his children and others wept together, speechless. Yuan had also written a will in prison, which is transcribed in full below: "Throughout my life, I have never done anything against my conscience. Since childhood, I have adhered to family teachings, cherishing things and loving people. Later, I followed the teachings of the sages, embracing universal love and taking loyalty and forgiveness as my principles, teaching tirelessly. Although I have not achieved great accomplishments, I believe I have not committed any major transgressions. Fortunately, Heaven has blessed me, allowing me to enjoy a peaceful family life and receiving the goodwill of society, leaving me with no regrets. However, in adapting to the environment, I often could not do as I wished. If I suffer misfortune due to misunderstanding, I will accept it with equanimity, without blaming Heaven or others. I only hope that my children will carry on my aspirations, contributing to society as much as possible, protecting the family, and informing my disciples and all those who share my ideals to always uphold the principle of self-discipline and benefiting others, striving to realize my unfinished aspirations, so that my spirit will not die. This is especially important to me. Farewell."</p>
<h3>Xie Baosheng's First Trial: Speaks Like a Street Thug; Frankly Says: If Guilty, Proceed Quickly</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, Xie Baosheng, one of Shanghai's "important figures," was interrogated. Xie, from Chongming County, is 64 years old. Before the war, he served as the captain and deputy inspector of the Detective Brigade of the Shanghai Special Municipal Police Bureau and was acquainted with the traitor Chen Qun. In September of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), when Chen defected to the enemy and became the puppet governor of Jiangsu Province, Xie also betrayed the Central Government and took the position of deputy director of the Police Department of the puppet Jiangsu Province, assisting the director in handling police affairs throughout the province for more than two years. As a result, the original administrative structure was completely destroyed, and the people suffered greatly from local oppression. Moreover, he used the convenience of his position to recruit followers and amass wealth, his crimes being obvious. After resigning, he resided in Shanghai and was arrested by the Military Intelligence Bureau. After investigation by the High Prosecutor's Office, he was prosecuted in accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations for Punishing Traitors.</p>
<p>When Xie was brought to trial yesterday morning, he was corpulent, wearing a loose gray practical long gown, yellow leather shoes, and white trousers. His hair was already balding, but his spirits were quite good. He claimed that in his more than sixty years of life, he had never entered a police station or attended school, had not graduated, had little education, and did not know many characters, having been in business since childhood. In the 16th year of the Republic (1927), when Shen Honglie was the director of the Shanghai Police Bureau, he served as an inspector for two months. He also worked as an administrative officer on the Zhaoshang Bureau's Xinmin steamship and later on the Changxing ship on the Yangtze River run by Du Yuesheng. During the "August 13th" Incident, he organized the "Youth Battlefield Service Corps," rescuing wounded soldiers and procuring cement and steel bars for the defense forces in the Wenzhou and Taizhou areas, risking his life to supply materials for the construction of defensive fortifications. The puppet Jiangsu Police Department governed 23 counties (Xie mistakenly referred to it as Lu Province, causing laughter in the courtroom), but he was only nominally in charge and could not handle affairs. The claim that he "widely recruited followers" was untrue, claiming that he only had a few dozen. His son, Xie Wenyan, graduated from the Central Military Academy and was arrested by the Japanese army with his younger brother on May 2nd of last year, tortured for eleven days, eventually being released without incident due to Chen Qun's help. Xie had the air of a "street thug," speaking very frankly, claiming that he wore a police uniform to avoid harassment from black marketeers and searches by Japanese military police at the train station. Finally, he said, "If I am guilty, proceed quickly; if I am not guilty, release me quickly!" The court adjourned the hearing for a later date, and the defendant was remanded in custody. When he met with his family, his wife cried bitterly, and his son's eyes were full of tears, but he himself calmly consoled them, asking them to set their minds at ease.</p>
<p>Li Zuyu Continues Trial. National Socialist Party member Li Zuyu, who had successively served as Vice Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Transportation, Vice Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Industry, Counselor of the Puppet National Government, and Director of the Planning Department of the Puppet Chamber of Commerce, willingly submitted to the enemy, colluding with the enemy to plot against our country. Li still attempted to evade responsibility, falsely claiming to have rescued the literary scholar Zhao Jingshen's father, Li Xitong, and Fang Yingda, etc. After the judge inquired in detail, he also ordered the trial to be adjourned to a later date.</p>
<p>Xie Baosheng suffered from ear problems and assumed an attitude of cupping his ear and straining to hear during the trial.</p>

<h3>Teacher Registration in Hankou: 65 Qualified; Schools Lack Desks and Chairs, Requesting Relief</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Hankou] A total of 143 people registered for the teacher registration organized by the Hankou Municipal Government. Most were disqualified due to lack of documents or failing the examination. It is reported that only 65 people qualified, who will be assigned to teach in various schools as soon as possible. It is also reported that the municipal education authorities have previously requested the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to allocate funds for repairing desks and chairs in various schools due to the lack thereof. Recently, due to the arrival of summer, students are crowded together in one room, making them extremely susceptible to heatstroke. Therefore, the addition of desks and chairs is extremely urgent. The authorities have sent another letter requesting that the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration allocate a portion of the proceeds from the sale of water-damaged wheat in advance as repair funds, and also requested the issuance of work-relief flour as rations for repairing desks and chairs, so as to benefit both education and relief.</p>

<h3>Trainee Expenses for Yunnan Provincial Training Corps Subsidized by Provincial Government</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Kunming] In the past, the expenses of the trainees of the Yunnan Provincial Training Corps were not approved by the provincial training corps, and all trainees were self-funded, resulting in a heavy burden on the trainees. This year, since Director Tao of the Department of Education took office, he requested the central government to issue trainee expenses, which was approved to be discussed with the provincial government. The provincial government agreed to allocate a portion from the public fund subsidy item, so starting from the 19th training course held this month, trainees will not pay any fees upon arrival, and the group will provide all the main and non-staple food expenses.</p>

<h3>Revision of Elementary School Curriculum Standards: Meeting Held Yesterday; Chaired by Director Gu Shusen</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency Report] The elementary education experts appointed by the Ministry of Education held a meeting yesterday morning at 9:00 AM at the headquarters of the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League on Rue Pere Robert to revise the elementary school curriculum standards. Those present included Chen Heqin, Dong Renjian, Shao Rugan, Zhao Yuren, Pan Pingzhi, Zhu Junti, Lu Guanliu, Liu Xunmu, Wang Zunwu, Chen Ruhui, Wu Zengjie, Ge Liting, and dozens of others. Director Gu Shusen served as chairman, and Xia Zhijiang and Cai Jiazhen served as recorders. Director Gu first stood up to report on the previous revisions of the curriculum, stating that since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the current curriculum was no longer suitable for the period of national reconstruction, so he had gathered experts again today for discussion, and he was deeply grateful for everyone's hard work in attending and participating. Then, the agenda was discussed, and the goals for future work were set. The experts discussed with great enthusiasm and intensity, and the revisions to the curriculum standards for each subject were mainly aimed at simplification and reducing the burden on students. The discussions yesterday focused on Chinese, nature, civics, and history and geography. Discussions continued throughout the day, and group meetings were held.

<h3>Japanese Middle Schools Abolish Martial Arts Course, Promote Western Wrestling</h3>
<p>[Kaizosha, Tokyo, 27th] In Japanese middle schools, martial arts have always been a compulsory subject. Since the Allied Headquarters ordered its abolition after the surrender, a small number of middle schools wanted to replace it with Western wrestling. After the chairman of the Western Wrestling Association, Hatta, contacted the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Education authorities considered it feasible, so the association will actively launch Western wrestling, with a view to popularizing it.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Municipal Middle School Principals' Association: Relief for Current Economic Difficulties; Submits Four Solutions to the Government</h3>
<p>[Our Report from Chongqing, 27th] The Chongqing Municipal Middle School Principals' Association hosted reporters yesterday to report on the difficulties faced by various schools and submitted four solutions to the government for relief: (1) When schools cannot be maintained, all equipment will be handed over to the government, which will repay the debts and appoint another principal to manage the school. (2) The government should subsidize private schools 5,000,000 to 10,000,000 yuan per term, depending on the number of classes, and all faculty and staff should receive the same treatment as public schools. (3) The government should designate a national bank or municipal bank to grant each school a low-interest loan of 5,000,000 to 10,000,000 yuan per term. (4) The free tuition places set up by private schools were originally intended to facilitate the children of public school teachers. In addition to waiving tuition and miscellaneous fees, food expenses should be subsidized by the government.</p>
<h3>Schools Will Go Bankrupt Due to Unrest, Resulting in Students Having No Books to Read: Director Xu of Zhejiang Department of Education Reports Educational Crisis</h3>
<p>[Our Report from Hangzhou] Director Xu Shaodi of the Zhejiang Department of Education reported on the province's education budget and the current financial difficulties of the provincial education agencies at the provincial government's weekly memorial meeting. The following is an investigation and report: The total amount of the provincial education budget for this year is 65,515,000 yuan for regular expenses and 294,750,000 yuan for temporary expenses, in addition to 2,906,000 yuan in supplementary expenditure funds managed by the Department of Education. The 60 million yuan in regular expenses include the annual operating and administrative expenses of more than 50 units, including provincial schools and social education agencies. The 290 million yuan in temporary expenses include equipment fees, school building repair fees, and the main and non-staple food expenses of all public-funded teachers and vocational school students in provincial schools, the majority of which are student meal expenses. These will be described separately below: Regular Expenses (1) The entire year's expenses for the Department of Education are 2,635,000 yuan. This small amount is barely enough to maintain regular administration, and it is quite difficult to hold any temporary events, let alone improve education.</p>
<p>A Drop in the Bucket, of No Help</p>
<p>(2) There are a total of 31 provincial secondary schools and above. Currently, only 11 schools still have fixed school buildings, but they are also badly damaged. The estimated repair costs are alarming, but only 60 million yuan has been received in demobilization funds. Of this 60 million yuan, the maintenance costs of taking over the puppet schools must also be deducted, so the demobilization funds allocated to each school are like a drop in the bucket and of no help. The schools are currently unable to restore their former appearance, let alone achieve the goal of improvement. The difficulties in running the schools are not limited to this. The total amount of education funds for this year is the same as last year, but the number of classes naturally increases every year, and the cost of living is so high that no matter how the Department of Education plans the budget, it always feels extremely difficult. The funds for the provincial schools are not only tight, but also cannot be received on time, because they have to go through many twists and turns and complicated procedures, which makes the situation even more difficult. In particular, the public grain matter from the past, such as the public grain and rice money for the 34th year of the Republic (1945), has not been received to this day. The schools are urgently unable to cope and are in extreme difficulty. Students blame the schools for their food, causing the principals to lose heart. This situation really cannot be maintained for long. If this continues, it may cause ten or so schools to go bankrupt due to unrest, resulting in students having no books to read.</p>
<p>Losing Sight of One Thing for Another, Feeling Thorny</p>
<p>(3) The funding for provincial halls and venues is even more difficult. Except for the Provincial Library and Museum, which have a small maintenance budget, the budgets for the Provincial Hangzhou People's Education Center and the Hangzhou Sports Field, among others, have been completely cut. Currently, the salaries of the curators and venue directors are all paid by the Department of Education, losing sight of one thing for another, making it feel thorny. Secondly, the largest expenditure under temporary expenses is student meal expenses. This year, there are a total of 7,800 public-funded students and normal school students in provincial middle schools, with each student receiving 4,000 yuan per month for main and non-staple food expenses in January, 5,000 yuan each in February and March, and 8,000 yuan each from April to October. In addition, there are 1,180 vocational students, with each student receiving 2,500 yuan per month for main and non-staple food expenses in January, 3,000 yuan each in February and March, and 5,000 yuan each from April to October. The central government originally approved the calculation based on only 6,000 students, a difference of more than 2,000 students, so the funds are short by 125,290,000 yuan. Finally, regarding the expenditure of temporary subsidies, there are currently 225 secondary schools and above in this province. Apart from the provincial schools, there are a total of 194 units. If each unit is allocated an average amount, it will only be more than 10,000 yuan. Therefore, it is difficult to grant the requests for subsidies from private schools in various counties. In the past few years, education funding has also been difficult, and Chairman Huang has tried his best to advocate the allocation of grain reserves at changing prices to supplement education funding. Now, Chairman Shen advocates being the same as the Ministry of Food and not using the method of using grain reserves. In the future, the provincial government will have to find other ways. Therefore, the education cause in this province will be facing an even more difficult situation. If the funding cannot be resolved, it is possible that the enrollment of public-funded students and the vocational school students enjoying public grain treatment will be suspended in the next semester, or even the enrollment will be temporarily suspended and the number of classes will be reduced. However, there is a contradictory phenomenon in society, that is, as a result of the promotion of national education, the number of graduates from primary and junior high schools increases year by year, and the need to add classes to middle schools is becoming more and more urgent. This issue seems worthy of everyone's attention. (Butterfly)</p>
<h3>Restoring Secondary Schools in Recovered Areas: Ministry of Education Formulates Incentive Measures, Temporarily Limited to Provincial, Municipal, and Excellent Private Schools</h3>
<p>[Ta Hua News Agency, Nanjing] In order to rapidly restore secondary schools in recovered provinces and municipalities and actively promote secondary education, the Ministry of Education has formulated the following incentive measures: All secondary schools in Jiangsu, Shandong, Fujian, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Henan, Hebei, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, etc., and in Beijing, Shanghai, Qingdao, Ping, Tianjin, etc., will use the number established before the war as a benchmark. Except for schools that were not damaged during the war or have been restored after the end of the war, the Ministry will allocate incentive funds based on the degree of damage for each secondary school restored in each province and municipality. However, this is temporarily limited to provincial, municipal, and excellent private schools. As for county-level secondary schools, the Department of Education should order each county to mobilize local financial resources to restore them as soon as possible. The effective period for incentives is from today until January of next year. The departments and bureaus of education in the recovered provinces and municipalities should report the restoration situation of secondary schools restored within the specified time limit once a month to the Ministry for verification. The incentive funds will be submitted by the Ministry to the Executive Yuan for approval and allocation to the Ministry, and then transferred by the Ministry.</p>
<h3>Respecting Teachers and Soliciting Donations: Yesterday's Results Were Good; Art and Calligraphy Charity Sale Also Achieved Results</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The student donation teams of the Teacher Respect Movement in this city solicited donations from shops throughout the city yesterday. It is reported that a certain team from Datong University raised one million yuan. A certain team from Soochow University raised 250,000 yuan, with a total of 60 million yuan for the entire school. A certain team from Qilu Middle School raised 300,000 yuan, and other schools and teams raised amounts ranging from 200,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan, and some raised several thousand yuan. The total amount cannot yet be estimated. This kind of group activity of accumulating sand into a tower is more meritorious for educational construction than building a seven-story pagoda. Yesterday's weather was very hot. More than 20,000 students solicited donations door-to-door and were quite hardworking. Many shop managers, seeing this situation, personally came out to greet them and voluntarily filled out donation forms. A certain public organization on Xizang Road sent a special person to take care of them by the roadside, providing tea. It is estimated that 26 dan of boiled water were used in one day. A certain soda company replaced tea with soda, and all 600 dozen bottles in stock were sold out in half a day. This generosity is truly admirable. The manager of a certain raincoat factory declared that he would donate 500,000 yuan in cash to various donation teams, but only once per school. All the students, encouraged and supported by the shops and companies, will continue to go around soliciting donations today, striving to reach the target of 150,000,000 yuan. The Teacher Respect Committee issued an urgent notice yesterday, which was conveyed by the China Middle School bicycle team to the various donation teams along the way. It stated: "This committee has received instructions from the Chief Executive that student donation teams should target shops as the only targets and must not obstruct vehicles. The donations received should be recorded in the donation book at any time and sent to nearby banks (see the back of the donation book for the list of banks). Please pay attention to this." (Ren)</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Art and Calligraphy Charity Exhibition held by the Teacher Respect Movement Committee in this city has achieved excellent results.

Also, the Zhengzhong Book Company purchased a masterpiece by Wu Daiqiu for 300,000 yuan.</p>

However, the construction of new school buildings and the purchase of land could not be completed in a short period of time. It was further designated that the college should relocate to Suzhou for classes first, and the Zhuozheng Garden, a famous scenic spot in Suzhou, was designated as the school building. The college has sent professors Liu Guidong and Jiang Ruisheng, lecturer Chen Anji, and many staff members to Suzhou to prepare.

<h3>Overseas Chinese Join Forces to Relieve the Famine in the Motherland: 260,000 Tons of Siamese Rice Shipped to China; Actively Planning to Develop Nanyang Trade</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Zheng Wulou, chairman of the Siamese Overseas Chinese Relief Committee for the Famine in the Motherland, is a large merchant in the local area. Together with Lian Yingzhou, chairman of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and many other leaders of the Overseas Chinese industrial and commercial community, they transferred from Chongqing to Nanjing to discuss with government officials on relieving the famine and developing Nanyang trade. They have now completed their public duties and arrived in Shanghai. It is reported that 260,000 tons of rice from Siam have been shipped in three batches. It is possible that cotton cloth, hardware, tea, etc. will be shipped from here. It is heard that the huge amount of foreign rice has been fully entrusted to the Ministry of Food for fair-price distribution, but the location is not limited to Shanghai. Yesterday, the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association held a banquet to exchange views. Mr. Zheng expressed his willingness to do his best to help solve the food shortage in the motherland, and said that the export trade to Nanyang must be opened up. Mr. Lian also expressed that the Nanyang market is willing to establish contact with the motherland. The two gentlemen have proposed several methods: (1) Apply for the government to open up exports to Nanyang and urge diplomatic envoys to go there to provide political assistance and lift the discrimination against Chinese goods by the former local government; (2) Establish import and export banks and trade banks in the motherland; (3) Exchange samples with the domestic industrial community. The person in charge of the association expressed their willingness to assist and put forward suggestions: (1) The quality and packaging of exported products should be improved, and the association can issue certificates in the future to prevent abuses; (2) Please send suitable goods for sale at any time for review. The new products here will also be compiled by the association and sent to Nanyang; (3) The opening of export trade to Nanyang may not have a significant effect in a short time due to unfavorable exchange rates, but from the standpoint of the Chinese nation, we should prepare in advance to strive for this good market. In addition, opinions were put forward by industry leaders such as Mr. Qiang and Mr. Jin of the dyeing and weaving industry. The Overseas Chinese representatives all expressed that everyone should abandon personal concepts and cooperate. It is heard that clothing is extremely scarce in Singapore and Siam, but if domestic goods are shipped, the price will be double that of Australian goods under the current circumstances. Whether the market can avoid falling into other hands depends on whether the exchange rate can be improved. A joint Overseas Chinese bank will be established in Shanghai, and an import and export bank will be established with a plan of 4 million to 10 million Siamese currency. Major dyeing and weaving factories will pass the samples to the association for forwarding. The Chamber of Commerce in this city will also unite with various important industry associations to entertain them again.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Rice Price Unchanged</h3>

Jingwu Xian rice also arrived in Shanghai by train. The lower Xian rice was more flat and fair, and the lower-grade Xian rice was more balanced. Flour fell by five or six hundred yuan, bran fell by three or four hundred yuan. The oil market came in with a rush of goods, and prices fell by two or three thousand yuan. Sesame was sluggish and lacked energy. Red sorghum remained depressed. Qingdao wheat was not selling, and prices fell by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The sales of corn from North China were suspended, falling by more than 1,000 yuan. Soybeans were flat, but raw peanuts still had a lively outlet in Nanyang, and prices rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Soybean cake sales were lively, and prices rose by 500 to 600 yuan. According to market news in this city, a total of more than 7,000 shi of rice arrived in this city yesterday.

The (Fort Amsterfam), represented by the American President Lines, returned to Shanghai from Singapore last Saturday, carrying 2,000 tons of foreign rice, about 26,000 bags. Although it is rice from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), it can be said to be the first batch of foreign rice arriving after the war. It is heard that President Lines has transferred four ships of the same tonnage from the US wartime shipping administration, dedicated to sailing on the Shanghai-Nanyang Islands routes, specifically for transporting foreign rice. It is also said that Jardine Matheson and Swire sent the Fusheng and Ninghai ships to Siam in the middle of last month and will also load rice to Shanghai. They will also return to Shanghai within days. After that, foreign rice can be continuously supplied.</p>

The Municipal Maritime Affairs Bureau has received the Ministry's order and notified all shipping companies last Saturday to allocate river steamers as much as possible to assist in the transportation. It is learned that Chang Yi Quan divided it into two sections. The section from Chongqing to Hankou is handled by the Minsheng Company, and the section from Hankou to Shanghai is handled by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Sze Hing and various private companies.

<h3>Tongbing Falls by 500 Yuan</h3>
<p>The bulls of public debt let go, and a sudden reaction occurred. Tongbing opened slightly higher in the morning, and after opening, it stood above 7,900 yuan. As various parties successively closed out, it gradually fell back. Retail investors were also worried and panicked, and killed at the rear, and then fell to 7,300 yuan. There was slight maintenance at low prices, and it once rose slightly to above 7,400 yuan. Low prices were still seen at noon. Compared with the previous close, the C bond fell back by 500 yuan, A, B, and D fell by 200 yuan each, and E also fell by a small 450.</p>
<h3>Bulls Take the Opportunity to Continuously Emerge: Both Chinese and Foreign Stocks Plunge; Yongsha's Change of Heart Also Helps Sell News</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks continued to be strong with Yongsha. Yongsha opened above 5,200 yuan in the morning and stood firm for a long time. Retail investors rushed to buy in large numbers. The financial bulls and related parties took the opportunity to continue to emerge, and began to decline. Meiya was seen at a high price of 4,880 yuan, Jingfu 388 yuan, Xinguang 338 yuan, and Qinxing 288 yuan, gradually falling. Later, news of the instability of two banks in the financial sector spread, causing panic. It was rumored in the market that Shui Sha had changed its original intention to help sell news. Low prices were seen near noon. Yongsha saw 5,700 yuan, Meiya 4,400 yuan, Jingfu 338 yuan, Xinguang 310 yuan, and Qinxing 240 yuan. Afterwards, the price stabilized, and the discount rebounded slightly. Compared with last Saturday, Yongsha fell back by half a percent, Meiya and Jingfu fell slightly, Xinguang and Qinxing were active, and some people squeezed up a little. Dongxing fell slightly. The smaller and medium-sized stocks were bought by someone who wanted to buy and sell, and they all rose. When foreign stocks opened, it was just the Yongsha gold period, so Yisha once rebounded to 14,200 yuan. However, no one was hyping it up, and the sudden reaction of Chinese stocks suppressed it. At noon, it hovered around 12,500 yuan. Other stocks were also brought down. As a result, except for Hutchison Whampoa, which fell limitedly, all the rest fell by about 10% compared with last Saturday.</p>
<h3>A Large Amount of Gold Is Coming in Continuously: The Gold Market Feels Apprehensive; US Dollar Settlement Tends to Be Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, as large quantities of US gold arrived and the valley gold price continued to be reported, people were shocked and sold in steps, unable to rise. The morning opened slightly stable, but soon it was attacked by selling pressure. Both emerging and short-selling forces came, and it retreated from 1.85 million to 1.78 million, and then stabilized. After 10 o'clock, it hovered around 1.79 million. The 135 articles registered by the Bank of China to the industry were distributed at a price of 1.78 million. Support was still lacking after 8 o'clock. At noon, it fell to 1.76 million. In the early afternoon, it continued to weaken to 1.75 million. Later, due to the strange strength of the US dollar, short covering was triggered, and next-day delivery rebounded to 1.8 million before leveling off. As a result, it fell 50,000, ornament gold 190,000, stringed silver 1,900. Silver dollars were banned. The morning saw a high of 1,330 yuan, and the last sale was at 1,280 yuan. The secret discount was still around one jiao four fen.</p>
<p>Foreign currency US dollars were used for settlement of yarn flowers and groceries. In addition, due to the stability of the situation, the concept of emphasizing gold and neglecting currency was gradually broken. The morning opened at 2,320 yuan and was sold. After opening, the gold market weakened and fell to 2,260 yuan before maintaining. At the same time, short covering activities caused the currency market to improve even though the gold price was weak. At noon, it struggled around 2,280 yuan. In the early afternoon, it continued to strengthen slightly. Due to the end-of-month relationship, foreign firms were keen to settle, and it once rebounded to 2,340 yuan, and then flattened slightly. As a result, it fell slightly by 5 yuan. The header load was tightened to 768 yuan per ten taels. Hong Kong notes fell another 3 yuan, and the Hong Kong exchange rate traded at 415 yuan. The Indian exchange rate was 520 yuan. The US exchange rate was still flat. The bank settled the new price of yarn flowers at 2,080 yuan.</p>
<h3>Huzhou Fried Green Tea Enters the Market</h3>
<p>It has been found that fried green silk tea is the main raw material for the baking and exporting of tea leaves. At the same time, it is also highly valued by local shops, estates, Wenkebang and other groups. This year's new crop from the Huzhou production area in Zhejiang has already entered the market and arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. After several negotiations between buyers and sellers, each "zu" (a unit of measurement) was sold for 120,000 yuan, and the market atmosphere was considered stable. Other grades saw consistent trading in and out, and the trend continued to stabilize. However, the quality of the new Longjing tea arriving in Shanghai from various production areas is visibly deteriorating, so prices have slightly decreased. However, the situation is a subtle decline rather than a sharp one. As for Qimen black tea and Dafang green tea, sales are relatively active, but the supply is very tight, and the foothold may be difficult to consolidate. The demand for Gong green tea sold to Mumbai, India, is holding steady, and medium grades can still be purchased. Although prices are hovering around the original levels, due to the quality of the goods, they are actually firmer than last week.</p>
<h3>Warehouse Rent to Double, Effective June 1st</h3>
<p>[United WeChat News] The Shanghai Warehouse Trade Association recently held its second meeting of directors and supervisors, drafting twenty-five industry regulations for mutual compliance. Seventy Chinese-owned warehouse businesses have already joined the association. After investigating with the Jianghai Customs, it was found that seventeen Chinese-owned warehouse businesses have not joined the association, and they have been sent letters with deadlines to register. As for the banking industry and foreign-owned warehouses, it is planned to first send personnel to liaise and then handle the membership procedures. The industry considers various expenses to be high. The original rate of ten yuan per cubic foot per month is now set to increase to one hundred and sixty yuan, effective June 1st.</p>
<h3>Timber Market Dull and Stagnant</h3>
<p>Construction in this city has not yet started on a large scale, and the supply of timber exceeds demand, so market prices have fallen. However, factory renovations and sporadic retail sales are still not bad, so market prices have not plummeted.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday the yarn market was exceptionally stable. In terms of customer sales, Tianjin and Jilu merchants still lacked momentum. Merchants from Fujian and Jiangxi frequently sought medium-sized yarns such as "Great Flying Boat" and "Double Women." The transaction price was not much different from last weekend. At noon, the Textile Construction Company listed yarn for sale as usual. There were Sunlight and Old Sunbeam wound-on-cone 20-count yarns available for sale. The listed price was the same as the previous period.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The New York cotton market rose five to twelve points. Near-term American cotton was priced at 27.88, forward cotton at 28.51, and Middling spot cotton at 28.50. The local Shanghai cotton market was mediocre. Shenxin No. 1 Factory purchased Bai Luoqu and Pengjiapo cotton, and Nantong Dasheng Factory purchased Yingtong Middling cotton. No other transactions were reported by manufacturers.</p>
<h3>Prices of Various Grades of Manufactured Goods Rise, Rayon Market Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rayon market opened weakly. 120-count Bright Rayon from Tianqiao started at 1.42 million yuan. The market was weak. The lowest asking price was 1.33 million yuan. The closing price recovered to 1.35 million yuan. There were a few buyers in the afternoon, and the asking price was 30,000 yuan higher. As a result, it was 90,000 yuan lower than last Saturday. 75-count Golden Rooster Semi-Bright Rayon was bought in the morning at a minimum asking price of 1.40 million yuan and sold at 1.42 million yuan. In the afternoon, it recovered to 1.41 million yuan, which was 20,000 yuan lower than last Saturday. Due to the increase in cocoon prices, the prices of various grades of manufactured goods increased by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Jardine Matheson had some absorption, with a price of 1.55 million yuan. The transaction price of sericin was 1.40 million yuan. The prices of silk fabrics and American-Asian quilt covers did not fluctuate much. Dachenggeli was 7.10 yuan higher per yard.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Transactions Scarce, Prices Flat</h3>
<p>Woolen fabric transactions were scarce yesterday from various ports. Because retail business continued to decline, summer goods prices were firm and about to be removed, autumn goods were in short supply, and sales were still early. Although a small amount of American goods continued to arrive, there were no definite arrivals of British goods. However, in general, both merchants and the public ultimately believe that woolen fabrics will eventually arrive, and because prices are more than half cheaper, they are willing to postpone purchases, leading to a gradual decline in retail and wholesale transactions. With May and June approaching, the woolen fabric market will, as usual, have a period of quiet.</p>

<h3>Factory Inventory Dwindling, Customer Sales Brisk, Cloth Market Price Surge Intensifies</h3>
<p>The price of grey cloth continues to rise due to shortages, and with constant purchases from all parties, market sentiment is increasingly bullish. Some believe that the goods allocated by the China Textile Corporation are all being discounted, so those holding goods are even more reluctant to sell at lower prices. There is an urgent demand for dyed cloth, serge, gabardine, and umbrella silk from merchants from Sichuan, but factory inventories are dwindling, and the price surge is intensifying. There is demand from Guangdong, Hubei, Hunan, Tianjin, Shanxi, Ningbo, and the Beijing-Shanghai area. The shouting at the Leyuan Tea House is very loud. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth is priced as high as 53,500 yuan, 3A Caichou is 51,000 yuan, and serge is 56,000 yuan. Later, it was heard that the price of gold had fallen, and market sentiment eased. At the same time, those who had profited from the surge released their goods, and the price fell by 500 to 1,000 yuan from the high price, but existing merchants still had inventory.</p>

<h3>Changchun Twenty-Nine Days (10)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Shao Shenzhi</p>
<p>Language barriers, never understood. Translated to them, it was still "no." Said that since it's not yours, you don't need to take care of it, cursing and punching Beckett in the chest. We were wary that this move was not simple, quietly calling the communist soldiers guarding the door. At this time, everyone heard the noise and ran downstairs to see, the workers also came, but the Swiss friends remained in the reception room. These soldiers were still pointing and cursing. Insisting on borrowing. "You guys, you can't escape." When the leader saw the workers, he immediately taught them a lesson:</p>
<p>"What are you still doing here? You have been liberated, why are you serving these youngsters? We are serving the people, you go away." Several workers saw the tense situation and immediately slipped away.</p>
<p>The guard at the door came in and asked where they were from. They replied that they were from the 27th Division, 21st Brigade, looking still very fierce. When asked their names, they hesitated and did not say, showing an oily attitude: "Tell you, my name is Ma, so what?" As a result, the guard was also angered. Four or five soldiers with guns escorted them out.</p>
<p>Not long after, these treasures came again with guns. We were really worried that they would clash, but there was no conflict. Finally, they took what they wanted to borrow.</p>
<h3>Protest to Mao Zedong</h3>
<p>From the 16th to the 27th, we were detained for a full eleven days. We exhausted a lot of effort to plead with Zhou Baozhong of the Chinese Communist Party to restore our freedom, but requests were made, but ignored. Day after day, these short eleven days felt like long eleven years. We looked from inside to outside, but saw the withered willows, which had changed from a scorched yellow color to a lovely green. This green world is explaining that the spring fire of our hearts is still far away!</p>
<p>On the evening of the 27th, it was also the day before Major Reich was to fly back to Shenyang (as a result, the flight was delayed until the 29th due to gasoline problems). We prepared some of his favorite dishes to send him off. When he was with us, his empathy and humor solved a lot of our loneliness.</p>
<p>When we had finished dinner, everyone realized that this was an opportunity: our long and unreasonable detention should be protested to Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party. We asked Major Reich to bring this message out for us. Major Reich, seeing the difficulty of our situation, resolutely agreed to our request.</p>
<p>Madsen of the Associated Press and Wheeler of the Chicago Daily News took on the task of drafting, but Chinese colleagues, feeling the difficulty of their situation, decided to withdraw. But they declared that they were consistent with them in spirit. The translated text of the letter of protest is as follows:</p>
<p>"To Mr. Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Yan'an Central Executive Committee:</p>
<p>We, the undersigned five American journalists, hereby protest to you because we have been detained in Changchun by the Communist Army of the Chinese Communist Party since the evening of April 16th and have been completely isolated from the outside world until now.</p>
<p>At the beginning, Major General Liu Qiren, the commander of the attacking army in the west, told us that for the sake of our safety, he had to set up guards around us. As long as the war was over, we could move freely immediately.</p>
<p>General Liu has said this to us, and it has been a full eleven days. The war has subsided for a long time, but we still cannot move freely in Changchun. The guards clearly told us that they were carrying out orders given to them by their superiors. This order is to prevent us from going out and also to prevent our friends from visiting.</p>
<p>Zhou Baozhong, the commander of the Changchun Garrison, also told us that in order to "protect our safety" from "Kuomintang secret agents," we were not allowed to go out. Since April 18th, we have met with three senior officers of the Chinese Communist Party. We have all protested to them, and we are willing to issue a voluntary letter of "no accident and no involvement," which means that in this quiet city, we will no longer cause the Communist army to worry about our safety, but everyone has refused us. Since April 19th, we have only gone out twice under guard "on order." Once, after we obtained permission from a guard to take shots of a burning house, another officer came and took away our two cameras. It has not been returned to this day.</p>
<p>Under the watchful eyes of guards, letting us walk on the streets of Changchun, letting us walk in front of many Japanese people who were formerly our enemies but are now freely swaying on the streets, we deeply feel that this is a great shame, so we no longer consider this questionable right to go out. We admit that the senior generals of the Chinese Communist Party are very polite to us, but their efforts are to restrict our freedom and delay our return to Shenyang.</p>
<p>We have heard the principle of freedom of the press in Yan'an. We have also discussed this issue with the CCP representatives in Chongqing, but our current situation is the exact opposite.</p>
<p>We are neutral journalists, reporting on the news of both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. We hereby request your immediate freedom."</p>
<h3>Acknowledging the Execution of Mistakes</h3>
<p>We had no real freedom until May 2nd, after contacting the Communist Army for twenty days. Zhou Baozhong repeatedly stated that it was to protect our "safety," and that if something happened to us, the CCP would not be able to take responsibility. Even if we were willing to sign a document for Zhou to disclaim responsibility, he said that he still could not take responsibility, which means: he insisted on taking responsibility. Why were we then stabbed with bayonets? Why did the Communist Army fire guns in our circle? Why did the Communist Army punch Beckett in the chest? We find it hard to believe that all this was well-intentioned.</p>
<p>At first, the quartermaster had to ask the guards for permission to go to the street to buy groceries. We really had to thank the two quartermasters and the three workers. The Communist Army had incited them (we believe not on the orders of their superiors, but as a result of their usual education) to not take care of us, but in twenty days, they have become our best friends.</p>
<p>Later, Kai Feng, the director of the Propaganda Department of the CCP Northeast Bureau, expressed his apologies to Shenzhi in a conversation, saying, "The Northeast Bureau only instructed the Changchun side to be responsible for protecting your safety. I didn't expect that you would lose your freedom as a result. It would have been better if the Northeast Bureau had come earlier." (The CCP Northeast Bureau moved to Changchun from Jilin on May 1st.) Shenzhi asked Kai Feng, "Does this mean that the occurrence of this incident was due to the mechanical execution of orders?" Kai Feng said:</p>
<p>"Yes, it was a little too mechanical."</p>
<p>Kai Feng came to see us at his residence on the afternoon of May 2nd and asked about the whereabouts of the TASS reporter. He replied that he did not know that there was a TASS reporter here. Xinhua News Agency reporter Liu Baiyu, who was one of the CCP reporters in the Beiping Executive Headquarters, came to Shenyang with the Northeast team. We were originally in Shenyang and welcomed every new colleague very much, but he suddenly appeared in Changchun. He did not come to see us when the Changchun Central News Agency was changed to Xinhua News Agency. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Rocket with a Range of Forty-Three Miles</h3>
<p>Engineers at Douglas Aircraft Company are studying ionospheric rockets. The rocket has a range of forty-three miles, setting a new record and can test the effects of the outer atmosphere on climate.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing in Crisis</h3>
<p>— This Newspaper 19th News, Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>Jiaxing is the center of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and one of the bases of the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area, known as paradise. The reporter arrived in Jiaxing by noon train from Hangzhou on the 15th. I went straight to the countryside and saw a group of farmers harvesting wheat. They were a little scared when they first saw me. Later, when I asked them about the actual situation, they told me: "The rice is all mixed up, and now we have to buy rice to eat!" I asked them, "How is the silkworm season?" "We can only hope for the silkworms. But the recent climate has been cold and hot, which has greatly harmed the silkworms."</p>
<h3>Jiaxing Has No Surplus Grain, Yet People Come Here to Purchase It</h3>
<p>I returned to the city under the moonlight. There was a lot of discussion in the city, all because the price of rice was constantly jumping upwards, already exceeding the 50,000 yuan mark, and people felt very uneasy. After the primary school teachers went on strike over "rice," the county government went on strike, and the teachers of the county middle school stopped teaching. The heads of nineteen townships requested to resign to the county government; they could not continue.</p>
<p>I interviewed Jiaxing's gentry, teachers, party leaders, county officials, lawyers, farmers, locals, etc. about this matter, and they all expressed fear about the rising price of rice. Why is the price of rice rising? The person in charge of the Rice Industry Association said: "The Hangzhou City established a Surplus Grain Purchasing Committee, but the people purchasing grain did not go to the provinces outside the province, but went to the Jiaxing area to buy. The Shanghai City established a Surplus Grain Purchasing Committee, and also specifically came to Jiaxing, which has no surplus grain, to buy. Jiaxing was originally self-sufficient, but because of the above two reasons, it has become worse and worse, reaching a state of serious panic."</p>
<p>Recently, the county government was ordered to collect military grain, giving a price of 24,000 yuan, which is 26,000 yuan different from the market price. The county government blamed the superiors for not stipulating a price difference, because after stipulating a price difference, the difference could be distributed to wealthy households, but if there was a similar regulation, I am afraid that when the apportionment reached the wealthy households, the wealthy households would pass it on to the poor farmers. Then what should we do?</p>
<h3>Three County Councils Meet to Petition the Provincial Government</h3>
<p>The problem is that there is too little grain in the countryside, and it is not easy to buy even at high prices. How can we collect the 24,000 yuan from this area? It is said that this 24,000 yuan was</p>
<p>President Chiang stipulated on March 15th. At that time, the price of rice was less than 24,000 yuan, and the order did not arrive until May 10th, and the grain was required to be delivered by June 10th. The people expressed absolute support for President Chiang, but disagreed with the delay in the issuance of provincial orders. They also disagreed with the fact that the funds allocated by the Central Government were transferred to the provincial level, and the provincial level has not yet issued them. At present, Jiaxing needs to collect 18,000 piculs of grain, Jia Shan needs 15,000 piculs, and Pinghu needs 15,000 piculs, a total of 48,000 piculs. The county councils, county party departments, of Jiaxing, Jia Shan, and Pinghu will meet in Jiaxing on the 18th to petition the provincial government.</p>
<h3>Disaster Relief to the Countryside, The Common People Are Afraid When They See It</h3>
<p>The county officials here said: "Now the county government's finances rely solely on slaughter taxes to maintain, and other tax revenues are negligible." Talking about county taxes, there are business license tax, usage license tax, slaughter tax, entertainment banquet tax, housing donation, etc. The central direct taxes include business tax, income tax, inheritance tax, stamp tax, profit tax, etc. The local people have many discussions about the collection methods of the direct tax bureau, because the direct tax bureau estimates the business of merchants, regardless of whether there are account books or not. The merchants said that business has been slack recently, but the direct tax bureau does not believe it. As a result of this disbelief, a tenant only pays 2,000 yuan in rent, but the donation tax paid exceeds 2,000 yuan. The government does not trust the people, so the people also suspect the government. When the government goes to the countryside to provide relief, the common people are afraid when they see it, and they have to ask the "teacher" before proceeding. Who is the "teacher"? It is the local tyrants, or the school teacher, or the gang leader in the countryside. It is said that when a military unit passed through the territory, they forcibly sold so-called "honorary cigarettes" to the people, and handed it over to the county government to apportion. The county government also transferred it down "as ordered." The people said: "How much money do we have to pay in the end? Just pay it all at once, don't bother us with bits and pieces."</p>
<h3>A Lot of Effort on Security, Still Feeling Many Difficulties</h3>
<p>Now, the Youth Army stationed in the county has indeed gained a lot of praise. The general public has corrected many incorrect concepts because of the arrival of the Youth Army. Nanhuizhen, which is attached to Jiaxing, was looted not long ago, and the light machine gun of the Yingzhai Police Station was also taken away. Bus robberies often occur at 11 p.m. in Pinghu. The area of Jia Bei Xinmu and Wangjiangjing is a bit uneasy. The people of the county government said: "We really put a lot of effort into security, but we still feel many difficulties."</p>
<p>Difficult, really extremely difficult. It is encountering such unprecedented difficulties in Jiaxing, a paradise place. What is the reason for this? Some people say that this is a social problem, but who caused the social problem? Regarding the surplus troops, the Central Government had already ordered them to be sent back to their hometowns or to be paid to cultivate the land. Regarding the issue of donation tax, the Central Government and provincial levels had already ordered the abolition of all harsh taxes. Regarding the issue of military grain, the Central Government has already purchased it at a long price. I think the focus of the problem is on "unification" and "selfishness"!</p>
<h3>French Scientific Research Begins to Embark on the Road to Revival</h3>
<p>— Translated by Hu Pinqing</p>
<p>If we recall the chaotic situation in France after the signing of the armistice agreement, we can easily understand the disordered state of French science at that time. In fact, since the declaration of war in 1939, scientific research in France had come to a standstill, as most researchers had successively gone to war, and the rest were engaged in research directly related to war and national defense.</p>
<p>Material Hardships</p>
<p>In terms of materials: some scientific instruments and materials were lost due to bombing, especially chemical products and raw materials for making instruments—metals and radio bulbs—were particularly scarce, and coal and electricity were becoming increasingly scarce. The reports of the Paris Academy of Sciences could not be published on time due to printing difficulties, and foreign scientific books and magazines could not be sent to Paris, so French scientists gradually became isolated from the outside world.</p>
<p>Lack of Talent</p>
<p>In addition to material difficulties, there was also a lack of scientific talent. Some scientists went to the front, were injured, or captured; some were ordered to go to North Africa, Britain, or the United States. Although some escaped to the non-occupied zone of southern France, they could not conduct research due to lack of materials. In addition, many scientists, such as Langevin and Labique, were captured.</p>
<p>German Devastation</p>
<p>The Germans tried to hinder the development of French science, so they occupied the School of Mines and Joliot's laboratory in the University of France, and closed the University of Paris, the University of Grenoble, and the University of Strasbourg. In addition, bombings and arrests greatly hindered research work.</p>
<p>Theories and Inventions</p>
<p>Finally, under the Vichy government, scientists were treated too poorly, so many researchers had to abandon cultural work in order to solve the problem of bread. Therefore, the number of French scientific talents gradually decreased. However, their confidence in the country was very strong, and their ideals remained unchanged.</p>
<p>In mathematics, Chang Ruo, Julia, Maro, etc., continued to research and publish papers. In theoretical physics, Madame Dolena studied universal gravitation. Miyula studied atoms, and Destouche studied basic principles. Regarding electromagnetism, Mariani had new theories and inventions.</p>
<p>In medicine, the most important was the Pasteur Institute. Although it lacked grain seeds and materials, it continued to supply medicines and blood serum.</p>
<p>All this proves that the French scientific community is still making continuous progress.</p>
<p>Two Types of Activities</p>
<p>In recent years, French scientific activities have mainly been divided into two types: (1) in-depth research on principles, and (2) training young scientists. Regarding the study of principles, the Institute of Mathematics, the Institute of Symbolic Logic, and the Institute of Theoretical Chemistry were established successively in 1941, 1942, and 1943. Regarding the training of young scientists, it involved providing captured scientists with various scientific books and magazines, and helping students who were secretly engaged in research work.</p>
<p>After the liberation of Paris, Joliot and Hautval, etc., began the work of innovating scientific research. Scientists already have an organization, and Joliot also proposed improving the material lives of the staff of the National Institute of Scientific Research and reorganizing the National Institute of Scientific Research. According to the new organization, there is a general management office above the institute, composed of fifteen scientists, and a council, composed of three hundred people. Whenever there is a special research topic, the general management office selects experts to form a specialized committee. French youths who had abandoned scientific research due to livelihood problems have now returned to resume their scientific careers, because they have been encouraged by the progress of foreign science. At the same time, they also know that the factors that determine a country's international status are the country's scientists and thinkers.</p>
<h3>The Mystery of the Central Plains</h3>
<p>— Correspondance from Northern Henan, 18th, Fan Shidong</p>
<p>At that time, Germany's hope of the West, whether no war, or no job.</p>
<p>The mystery of the Central Plains was half revealed due to the trip of Xu, Zhou, and Zi, but there is still half that has not been revealed. Why did the Chinese Communists (CCP) make such a fuss and start this storm?</p>
<p>Li Xiannian Unifies the Communist Army</p>
<p>Establishes Six Regiments</p>
<p>The leader of the Communist army in the Central Plains is Li Xiannian, who is known to all. In the past, some people said that he was a carpenter by origin, but it has now been clarified that he is not a carpenter. When Wuhan retreated during the War of Resistance Against Japan, he brought forty or fifty cadres from Yan'an to Gouzhu and trained a teaching battalion with local communists. After that, he went south to contact Yang Xueqing, the Communist army leader in Hubei, unified the Central Plains Communist army, and established six regiments. After the New Fourth Army Incident, he became the commander of the Fifth Division of the New Fourth Army. From then on, he scurried back and forth between the Dabie Mountains, expanding his forces. After Li defeated the Fourth National Security Corps in Eastern Hubei and annexed the puppet Wang Boqing's troops, he became the 13th, 14th and 11th brigades, and there was an organization called the Hubei-Henan Border Security Command. It is said that Li Xiannian has the ability to command ten regiments in combat.</p>
<p>When the Northeast was in turmoil, Zhou Enlai suddenly fired a shot, saying that there would also be large-scale battles in the Central Plains. Mr. Xu Yongyu, Zhou Enlai, and Bai Lude personally went to Xuanhuadian to investigate the truth. Today, the Central Plains of China is not the outward development of the Communist army.</p>
<p>The Communist Army Moves Outward</p>
<p>National Army Increases Guard</p>
<p>After the enemy troops surrendered, Li Xiannian's troops not only controlled the Dahong and Tongbai Mountains, but also attacked near Xiangfan, which was between November and December of last year, and the momentum was very great. However, the defeat at Shuanggou was irretrievable, and as a result, they fled to the Guangshan and Zhushan areas east of the railway. If it were not for the order for a ceasefire agreement, Li's troops would have had no foothold in the Central Plains.</p>
<p>The Central Plains Communist army arrived at Luoshan and Guangshan, originally occupying only the southern corner. In order to rise again, they have invaded the southwest of Gaochang and Huangchuan since the ceasefire order. Taking Guangshan as an example, they originally occupied only four villages, but now they have occupied twelve villages, accounting for three-quarters of the area of ​​Guangshan. The National Army naturally took precautions against the Communist army's attempt to re-develop. According to Li Xiannian: there is no way for the outside situation in the Central Plains to allow him to develop, so he changed his mind and said that the Central Plains Communist army has no food to eat and asked to eat in northern Anhui. In fact, in that area, in the first stage, how much grain was eaten, and how much grain was sent to the people; in the second stage, 40 kilograms of grain per mu were sent to the people; in the third stage, how much grain the people had, and how much grain was taken. The market price of rice per dou in Guangshan is 3,000 yuan, and the Communist army once threw it out at 1,500 yuan per dou. Only God knows that the Communist army has no food to eat. Moreover, the government took a big hit and lent 200 million yuan to the Communist army to buy food. It is impossible to say that the Communist army has no food to eat, but they still want a way out, so they say that the National Army will have a large-scale offensive against the Communist army.</p>
<p>Each Soldier Receives Bullets</p>
<p>Preparing to Flee to Northern Anhui</p>
<p>More than half a month ago, each Communist soldier had already received two shirts and five pairs of straw sandals, and at the same time issued seventy or eighty bullets, preparing to go to northern Anhui; and one or two thousand of them had already disguised themselves as salt miners to their destination. Going from the Central Plains to northern Anhui may be the first step to the Northeast; and according to the Luoshan Agreement, neither side's troops are allowed to move. Therefore, the National Army had to take a serious attitude towards the Communist army's attempt and the destruction of the agreement. The Communist army referred to this when it said that there would be a large-scale civil war in the Central Plains. If the Communist army has superior military strength in the Central Plains today, it would have attacked many counties and plundered many lands, and another saying would have come out, at least nailing a "liberated" sign to the counties and cities they attacked. Communist Regiment Commander Escapes</p>
<p>Communist Regiment Commander Escapes</p>
<p>White Horse Sold Off</p>
<p>The Communist army in the Central Plains has its own internal difficulties. Several deserters come out every day. A few days ago, a regiment commander rode a white horse and escaped. The white horse was sold to the people for 50,000 yuan as capital for fleeing. But they were too embarrassed to tell the group as a reason to request to go to northern Anhui or the Northeast.</p>

<h3>The Tannu Uriankhai Problem</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: The Outer Mongolia issue was addressed by Chairman Jiang in his speech at the joint meeting of the National Defense Supreme Committee and the Central Standing Committee on August 24th of last year, allowing its independence. Subsequently, on October 20th, Mongolian citizens voted, and a majority approved independence. On January 4th of this year, our National Government issued a notice recognizing the independence of Outer Mongolia. The matter of independence was thus determined. However, in addition to the four parts of Chechen Khan, Tusheet Khan, Sain Noyon Khan, and Zasagtu Khan, there were also two parts, Khovd and Tannu Uriankhai, in the old Mongolian territory of our country. When Outer Mongolia first became independent, Khovd was unwilling to join the autonomous organization and stubbornly defended Khovd City for more than a year. In the fourth year of the Republic of China, I acknowledged Khovd as an autonomous region, and the princes of Khovd sighed with caution when they heard of it. This situation was falsely reported to our government by Hong Zhen, the assistant officer stationed in Khovd. It is evident that even though they are both Mongols, they cannot agree because of different ethnic lineages. Tannu Uriankhai is north of Khovd, and the people are the Tuvan and Huhot tribes. The Tuvan tribe was unwilling to join the Outer Mongolian organization and established the Tannu Tuvan Republic. Our country was in a time of trouble and did not have time to inquire, which was a neglect. This time, when recognizing the independence of Outer Mongolia, how to deal with the Tannu Tuvan Republic was not mentioned, which inevitably became a question? Has this country automatically canceled its independence? Or merged into the Outer Mongolian Republic? Or has it not yet voted? It is impossible to speculate. Upon seeing the United Press London telegram from this newspaper on January 4th, according to the London Times, the Tannu Tuva Republic on the northern border of Outer Mongolia has been formally incorporated into the Soviet territory. Upon investigation, Tannu Tuva is the same translation as Tannu Tuvan. According to this, since this country has neither merged into the Outer Mongolian Republic nor canceled its independence, it should still be our country's territory, and a self-determined area for citizen voting. How can the Soviet Union arbitrarily take the lead and incorporate it into its territory? The territory of a country has the sovereignty of a country. Allowing it to be independent still requires citizen voting procedures. Since the Soviet Union is one of the United Nations and stands on the same front as our country, there is no reason to silently incorporate our territory into its territory without my consent. Upon receiving such news, our country should immediately lodge a serious protest with the Soviet Union. Why is it delayed for so long and silent? In this surging new trend, all lands that are customarily subordinate to others want to break free from their shackles and become independent. The independence of India, Vietnam, and the East Indies are all good examples. The entire Outer Mongolia has always been the complete territory of our country. How can we go against the trend of the world and lightly give it up? When the Outer Mongolian citizens voted, our government sent representatives to Mongolia to inspect. Khovd and Tannu Uriankhai were all voting districts and should be carefully inspected without exception. If this matter was not noticed beforehand and only inspected in Kulun and other places, it would be incomplete. This matter should be investigated thoroughly to make amends.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, Outer Mongolia's second independence occurred in the tenth year of the Republic of China; Tannu Tuvan's independence occurred in the eleventh year of the Republic of China. When our government received this news, it should have openly discussed and decided whether to recognize it or not. After making a decision, it should have notified all editorial agencies to factually include it in geography textbooks for primary and secondary schools, so that students know that the border issue is serious and know what to be vigilant about. It must not be kept strictly secret, so that the people of the whole country are unaware. When the author was editing the junior high school Chinese geography book for the World Book Bureau in the 22nd and 23rd years of the Republic of China, he fully included the two republics of Mongolia and Tannu Tuvan, and also selectively recorded the national conditions of the two countries. Because such things are usually public and not usually secret, the national territory has already changed, but the book still does not mention a word about the changed facts, so the geographical knowledge that students get is inevitably inaccurate. In recent years, when testing high school students, only one or two out of ten know that Mongolia has two republics. Not to mention junior high school and elementary school students. This is a neglect of the education sector. (In my opinion, even if the textbook does not record this matter, geography teachers should find ways to supplement it when teaching.)</p>
<p>When the Yalta Secret Agreement was announced, our country had no obligation to abide by this secret agreement. Its first article said: "The status of the Outer Mongolian Republic should remain unchanged." This article is in line with the purpose of the National Father to assist Outer Mongolia. Our government has automatically implemented it and decisively recognized its independence. On the surface, it seems to be fulfilling the secret agreement, but in reality it is irrelevant. However, this matter is formally unfavorable to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union helps other ethnic groups become independent, and secret agreements are required beforehand. One can know his attitude and benefit to this matter. Tannu Uriankhai is the territory of our country. The Soviet Union has not made a secret agreement with the United Nations, nor has it obtained our country's permission, but has arbitrarily included it in its territory and renamed it Tuva Province. I don't know which article of international public law it is based on. Taking and demanding without any scruples. If this matter can be recognized, there is nothing that cannot be recognized. After the matter was discovered by the newspaper, our government still did not express much, and each public group also did not send telegrams to question. It is probably because the Soviet Union has not officially announced it, and the situation in the East Nine Provinces is urgent, and the Tannu Uriankhai matter has become a secondary issue and there is no time to take care of it. Now that the disputes between the East Nine Provinces and the Soviet Union have come to an end, protests can also be filed based on British newspapers. If the Soviet Union is willing to establish full diplomatic relations after the protest, it will still uphold the principle of national self-determination and let the local people vote for a public decision. However, this area has been listening to the Soviet Union for a long time and has been deeply anesthetized. It must be recovered and managed for several years to correct its psychology before the vote can have the correct concept. If the Soviet side ignores it or delays in various ways, I should announce it to the world and let the arbiters of justice make a fair judgment. We must not endure in silence and create a suspension. All my people should always know that the country is important. Even an inch of land cannot be easily lost. All those who know that there is a party and do not know that there is a country, wake up quickly! You must know that the rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of every citizen. China is now facing the most serious sun head and cannot repeat the opportunity to be a instrument for tigers and put the country in a position of eternal doom. Translation, 5, 25.</p>

<h3>Roosevelt's "Game"</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>The former President of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt, and the explorer William Beebe were good friends. According to William Beebe, when they were in the Shamo Mountains, they often played a "game". When they were talking late into the night, they would go to the meadow, look up at the sky and search for a small, half-bright, faint misty spot in the lower left corner of the "Pegasus" in the sky. Then one of them would recite astronomical words and say:</p>
<p>That is the spiral galaxy of Andromeda.</p>
<p>As big as our Milky Way.</p>
<p>This is one galaxy among hundreds of millions of galaxies.</p>
<p>There are a trillion suns in it, each bigger than our sun.</p>
<p>Then Roosevelt would grin at Beebe and say, "Now I think we're small enough! Let's go to sleep."</p>
<p>Self-boasting and arrogant humans can learn a lesson from Roosevelt's "game".</p>
<p>How long is life? Humans are originally tiny animals in the universe, so why should we spend all day struggling for power and profit?</p>
<p>Let us use this limited life to seek real benefits for the country, the people, society, and humanity!</p>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>The Meadow Blocked by Ropes</h3>
<p>— Qiang Xun</p>
<p>In the park, the four weeks of the large meadow were blocked by ropes, and several wooden signs with "Keep Out" were inserted. Tourists paced outside the meadow in a daze. A child came along, holding his grandmother's hand.</p>
<p>"Grandma, let's go to the meadow and roll around."</p>
<p>"No, didn't you see this sign?"</p>
<p>Although the child could not read, he understood the meaning of blocking the ropes. He pulled his grandmother to find a bench.</p>
<p>In the west corner, an armed comrade helped a lady cross over and walked into the meadow, looking around proudly. The expression was like the "privileged class" of the enemy puppet period, glaring at a group eating household rice blocked by the blockade line.</p>
<p>A small team of sailors in navy blue uniforms jumped over the barrier and comfortably sat on the grass.</p>
<p>The people outside the ropes were a little uneasy.</p>
<p>Over there, three Allied soldiers who did not know Chinese came. They looked at the ropes and then at the "uniformed comrades" on the meadow and unhesitatingly stepped over the ropes. They immediately chose a place, posed, and prepared to take pictures.</p>
<p>The children outside the ropes could no longer care about the "prohibition", and they swarmed through the ropes and surrounded the people taking pictures.</p>
<p>The tourists also crossed over the ropes and walked into the meadow, filling that "green emptiness" in an instant.</p>
<p>A man picked up a "Keep Out" wooden sign that had been pulled off and patrolled the meadow, looking around resentfully. Suddenly, a small leather ball flew over. He quickly picked it up and walked out proudly. An elementary school student chased after him and asked for the ball back.</p>
<p>"You can't kick a ball in the park!"</p>
<p>"I won't kick it next time, thank you for giving it back to me."</p>
<p>"No way."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry."</p>
<p>"If you nag again, I'll lock you up for three hours with the ball."</p>
<p>The elementary school student was speechless. He walked away in tears—three hours of freedom is more valuable than a ball.</p>
<p>The sun broke through the heavy clouds. A tourist who was playing hide-and-seek with his child took off his jacket and hung it on the nearby "Keep Out" wooden sign, and also put his hat on it. It looked like a scarecrow stuck in the field to scare sparrows.</p>
<h3>Bridge</h3>

<p>It uses a serious gaze, staring at the turbulent water, welcoming the future with a smiling mood.</p>
<p>Night, dawn, bit by bit,</p>
<p>Flowing past and returning around it,</p>
<p>It does not lament the vicissitudes of life,</p>
<p>It only knows that serving humanity is a must!</p>

<h3>Preventing Nearsightedness</h3>
<p>— Hu Deling</p>
<p>I am a nearsighted person, and because of my nearsightedness, I suffer in many ways and feel deeply pained. I remember once when I went to visit a friend, he happened to be out. After waiting for a long time, because I had other important matters to attend to, I couldn't wait any longer and said goodbye to the person who received me. As I walked out of the door, not many steps away, someone was coming towards me from afar. I couldn't see clearly who it was, and I didn't dare to stop and greet them, fearing I would make a mistake and embarrass myself, so I just walked with my head down. But when I got closer, it was the very friend I was trying to visit. He said, "I was waving to you from far away, why didn't you acknowledge me?" His tone seemed accusatory. Afraid that he would be unhappy and misunderstand, I quickly apologized repeatedly, explaining that I was nearsighted, and he finally understood and forgave me. Such incidents are numerous. Visual impairment has a great impact and is deeply and significantly related to lifelong happiness.</p>
<p>The causes of nearsightedness are sometimes hereditary, but more often they are due to a lack of attention to eye hygiene and care in daily life after birth. Especially during school age, children are young and ignorant, unaware of the importance of eyesight, and don't know how to protect it. Parents also neglect to provide guidance, leading to nearsightedness. By the time they realize it, it's too late to regret, and they harbor resentment for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>Since eyes are so important, parents today should pay attention to their children's eyesight and correct their poor reading posture for the sake of their children's eyes. Here are a few points that I can think of at the moment for your reference:</p>
<p>(1) Adequate Light – Eyes tire easily in places with insufficient light, and it is not suitable to read there. In strong sunlight, because of the intense exposure to ultraviolet and infrared rays, it is harmful to eyesight and should be avoided.</p>
<p>(2) Appropriate Distance – Light should come from the left. For close-range eye work such as reading or embroidery, a distance of one foot is most appropriate. Too close or too far is not suitable.</p>
<p>(3) Correct Posture – When reading, the head should be upright, and the book should be tilted, maintaining a 45-degree angle with the horizontal plane, so that the paper surface is perpendicular to the line of sight. Otherwise, it will harm the eyesight. Do not read books or newspapers while lying down.</p>
<p>(4) Eye Strain Regulation – If reading or doing close-range eye work for an hour, close your eyes and rest quietly for one or two minutes to adjust. Or look up and gaze at distant objects from time to time.</p>
<p>(5) For electric light bulbs, frosted white or sky blue bulbs are most appropriate. To avoid direct exposure to strong light and stimulating the eyeballs, it is best to have the indoor light reflected from the ceiling.</p>
<p>(6) Do not read or write when it is getting dark and there is insufficient light.</p>
<p>(7) Sometimes, if you use your eyes for too long, tears will flow out, indicating that you have used your eyes too much and your eyes are tired. You need to rest immediately. You should stop immediately, close your eyes and rest quietly, so that your eyesight will not be damaged. Otherwise, it will definitely be harmful.</p>
<p>(8) Promote physical health, get up early every day or stroll in the park, or walk in the fields, get close to nature, relax and enjoy yourself, benefit your mind and body, promote physical strength, and strengthen your eyesight.</p>
<p>I think that if you pay attention to the above points, whether you are a child or an adult, whether your eyes are nearsighted or not, if your eyesight is healthy, you will not become nearsighted; if you are already nearsighted and wear glasses with accurate prescription, your eyes will not worsen further.</p>
<p>Cultivation</p>
<h3>Effort as the Basis</h3>
<p>— Shen Ying</p>
<p>In terms of personnel matters, there are too many things that people are currently dissatisfied with. However, being dissatisfied with others is passive, while being dissatisfied with oneself is active.</p>
<p>If we can humbly examine ourselves in this way, to see what defects we have and what areas we should improve, then I think it will be more beneficial than being "cynical and hating the world."</p>
<p>After this great war, how can we expect to step onto the broad road of prosperity in one stride? We should learn from the pain and improve society and revive the country. The responsibility lies on every citizen. Although this is not an easy task, it is not an impossible one. We must firmly remember our own position and start by working hard in our own role, first doing our part well. If the majority of people are doing well, then the shortcomings of the minority will naturally have no foothold.</p>
<p>Stop complaining about being dissatisfied with reality, because we are responsible for improving it. To improve reality, we must first examine ourselves. Don't forget that you yourself are an owner of the country.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Thoughts</p>
<h3>Unsuited to the Place?</h3>
<p>— Jiang Zhaoran</p>
<p>"Unsuited to the place" is a common phrase in officialdom.</p>
<p>To explain this phrase, it is best to use an analogy: Suppose someone is in charge of a certain county, but he knows nothing about the local customs, traditions, and history. Therefore, when he does things, it is often not very smooth, and may even provoke public resentment. But the county magistrate is essentially a good county magistrate. The supervisor of the county magistrate should transfer him to another county in the hope of smooth administration and harmony. This is the true meaning of the phrase "unsuited to the place."</p>
<p>But true meaning is true meaning, and facts are facts. Isn't that so? According to Jiangxi newspapers in March: The county magistrate of Xinyu County, Song Wei, the county magistrate of Zuochuan County, Zhou Che, the county magistrate of Lichuan County, Zhu Weihan, and the county magistrate of Chongren County, Que Lingyun, all owed more than 100,000 dan of grain. The people of each county sued them to the Director of Civil Affairs, Wang Cifu. However, Director Wang transferred them from County A to County B, and from County B to County C. The reason given was "unsuited to the place."</p>
<p>According to this, the ancient saying of "unsuited to the place" has been given a new meaning by the "times" and has simply become a "shield" for officials to collude in corruption!</p>
<p>This "shield" is truly beautiful and bright, and these officials are truly extremely clever!</p>
<p>But unfortunately: This "shield" is accumulated from the "dregs of the times." In the future, it will inevitably be destroyed by the "torrent of the times"; and the "torrent of the times" is beginning to surge. How long can this "shield" stand? This should be the concern of the officials!</p>
<h3>Cuckoo</h3>
<p>— Huang Yihao</p>
<p>Cuckoo, cuckoo.</p>
<p>Having trod all over the country,</p>
<p>I have no place to rest.</p>
<p>Not a single grain of millet for me.</p>
<p>There is still the sound of killing in the world,</p>
<p>And ceaseless strife and plotting,</p>
<p>If the killing continues—</p>
<p>Ah! The end of the common people is near.</p>
<p>Busy, ah! The busyness of the killers.</p>
<p>No leisure, ah! No leisure to cuckoo,</p>
<p>Even though the shadow of famine has already appeared,</p>
<p>Appearing in every city area.</p>
<p>Eighty percent of the world,</p>
<p>Is crying out in material panic.</p>
<p>The self-destruction of mankind</p>
<p>—Is war, is famine.</p>
<p>Cuckoo, cuckoo,</p>
<p>Sow the grains of peace and auspiciousness!</p>
<p>You reap what you sow, ah!</p>
<p>There is no harvest without cultivation.</p>
<p>Even in the struggle for survival,</p>
<p>Sow the seeds of life.</p>
<p>Don't chase after a lifeless existence, ah!</p>
<p>Don't seek this meaningless lament.</p>
<p>Not a single grain of millet for me,</p>
<p>No place for me to rest,</p>
<p>Having trod all over the country,</p>
<p>Cuckoo, cuckoo.</p>

<h3>Fake DDT Should Be Reported</h3>
<p>— Wen Bo</p>
<p>Recently, there have been many kinds of counterfeit American DDT sold on the streets. The newspaper (refer to the local news on the fourth version of the first page of this newspaper on May 24) has already exposed it. Now, I will list several ironclad proofs of counterfeiting, put forward by experienced experts, for your reference. I hope that the health authorities will pay attention to it and report it to avoid citizens being deceived and losing confidence in genuine DDT.</p>
<p>(1) Most of the fake DDT on the market is packaged in yellow beer bottles. In fact, American toxic drugs are packaged in green or blue bottles, and not in yellow bottles.</p>
<p>(2) American DDT is not packaged in twelve-ounce containers (at least sixteen ounces per "pint").</p>
<p>(3) American medicines emphasize instructions the most, but most of the DDT on the streets has no instructions.</p>
<p>(4) According to regulations, DDT is a toxic drug, and the label should have the word "Poison," but most of the DDT sold on the streets does not have it.</p>
<p>(5) American trademark law stipulates that packaging must not be the same, but the packaging of more than a dozen kinds of "American DDT" sold on the streets is not much different.</p>
<p>(6) American medicines pay great attention to brand names and names, but the English spelling on the labels of most of the beer brand DDT sold on the streets is wrong.</p>
<p>According to the inspection results of a certain expert, some so-called American DDT are almost entirely kerosene. In fact, twelve ounces of kerosene costs less than two hundred yuan, and a beer bottle costs less than one hundred yuan, but the selling price is as high as two thousand five hundred yuan. Deceiving citizens and shaking the confidence of ignorant citizens in science, these unscrupulous merchants are really hateful. We hope that the municipal authorities will investigate to the end and bring these people who use the name of fake science to cheat people out of money to justice, so as to deter others from following suit.</p>

<p>Education</p>
<h3>Thoughts on the Family</h3>
<p>— Ying Yang</p>
<p>A long time ago, I read a short essay by an American university professor, "I Was Fired!"</p>
<p>He was an upright professor who took his teaching very seriously. As a result, most of the students in his class failed. The students made many contemptuous gestures, but he ignored them and didn't care.</p>
<p>A well-meaning professor advised him, "Grades are not gold, why not be lenient and do people a favor?" But he believed that he was not being stingy with grades, he just hoped that grades could accurately measure talent!</p>
<p>The principal summoned him to the office and said to him, "The students' parents are accusing you, their children did not come to school to suffer the torture of grades." Finally, he warned him, "Please consider the future of the school and be more lenient with grades!"</p>
<p>He did not do so, so he was fired.</p>
<p>Once, by chance, he went to visit one of his students' homes. He was surprised that such a wealthy family could be so crude and noisy. The radio was playing some unpleasant tunes. He lamented that without an atmosphere of Shakespearean drama or Mozart's music, how could one hope to train a Shakespeare or a Mozart?</p>
<p>So he no longer felt unfortunate about being fired.</p>
<p>I am now facing a similar test. I wonder why there are such similar environments. When I first stepped into the door, I heard the radio playing comedies and noisy musical segments. I felt like I was standing in front of a department store. When I was teaching, the sound of mahjong in the next room was stimulating my nerves.</p>
<p>Once, I saw my students fighting to read Shanghai-style tabloids. I was shocked. Some people lamented that yellow journalism was flowing into the hands of elementary school students, which is a serious problem. I think the police should more actively crack down on yellow journalism. At the time, I considered whether it was appropriate to dissuade them, and eventually another force compelled me to do so. Of course, I couldn't put on a stern face and lecture them. I tried to arouse their love of literature and forget about this matter.</p>
<p>A week passed, and I didn't see them reading similar books, but two weeks later, I saw them reading them again. Whose fault is this?</p>
<p>Is yellow journalism really more attractive? But everyone knows that yellow journalism has a bad stimulus for an immature youth.</p>
<p>There is not a parent who does not hope that their children will grow up and develop for the better, but the environment induces them to take the road to depravity.</p>
<p>"Without an atmosphere of Shakespearean drama or Mozart's music, how can one hope to train a Shakespeare or a Mozart?"</p>
