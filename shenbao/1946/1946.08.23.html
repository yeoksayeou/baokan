<h3>首都政治活動頻繁廣泛交換談判意見宋院長首次會晤周恩來</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕馬帥定廿三日晨由京飛潯轉牯，京中商談由司徒雷登大使負責。又國防部白部長廿二日晚六時往訪馬帥，談近一小時始出。七時司使再訪馬帥，同進晚餐。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕廿二日京中政治活動頻繁，政府·共黨與美方作循環式之接見，各方致力中心厥爲企求打開和平商談之門。司徒大使私人顧問傅涇波吿記者，目前接觸，僅廣泛交換商談原則問題及程序問題，未得進展。此種糾結不解之嚴重情勢，使居間之調停人深感頭痛·正式商談何時能够重開，刻下尙難逆料。政府方面將易宋子文院長爲談判代表。廿二日宋氏頻與美方及共產黨人士晤談，已見其端倪。據聞，蔣主席在牯嶺時，即曾屬意於宋氏。馬帥廿二日上午九時在寗海路行館接見宋氏，談一小時，宋氏辭出。司使自晨迄晚，整個時間幾均消磨於政治性之談話中。晨九時半在使館接見兪大維部長，十二時訪馬帥及柯克海軍上將，下午四時又約周恩來晤談。另一令人注目之會晤，即十時半宋子文首次在私邸接見周恩來，宋語周，渠係私人資格，並非代表政府，十一時四十分周辭出。晨間兪大維曾謁宋院長，面吿最近和平商談經過詳情。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕和平商談，廿二日重起頻繁之接觸，其在形式與趨向方面，可看出與以往不同之兩點，（一）即宋院長已出現和平談判之陣營，此點足示政府對和平之企求迫切，寗願以不同之方式以求達和平之目的。共方爲今日周恩來之訪司使，係共產黨代表團王炳南事先往大使館所商約，一反過去由馬司出面邀約之慣例，此點則足表示共黨方面亦欲大使繼續作居間之調停者，據聞廿二日司·周會晤時，大使曾詢及共黨方而張家口之廣播，唯周氏僅答以非總攻擊令，而爲出於自衛之號召。周廿二日曾表示，和平總必須達成，惟即看司·馬兩氏如何做法，並謂「和平總是可以的」，據熟悉談判內容人士稱：過去周從未作此語。</p>
<h3>白部長發表談話　政府仍以談判方式恢復和平</h3>
<p>〔路透社南京廿一日電〕國防部白部長今日下午接見記者，發表談話時，詢以政府是否認張家口電台之廣播，及延安解放日報之社論，等於共產黨之宣戰，白氏答稱：「余個人希望此舉並非表示已有戰爭狀態之存在，南京官方態度，認爲仍得以政治談判方式，停止衝突，恢復和平，吾人尙未準備戰爭」。記者又詢以若共黨擴大衝突區，並積極準備全面戰爭，政府是否仍採消極之靜等政策，以待和平解決方法之覓得。白將軍謂：「若吾人被攻當然要將其逐退，隴海綫之情形正如是」。白將軍不能預見國共將正式宣戰，並稱：「吾人決不使該種狀態發生，以談判方式解決一切問題之志願，苟未消滅，決不需要發生此項狀態。每次戰事，均係共黨主動，吾人若非被攻，從不動手，吾人已盡力避免繼續流血，蓋中國正亟需和平也」。白將軍謂，延安雖頒動員令，但政府尙未採取反揹施，渠不知國軍有新行動，以應付全面攻勢之事。記者繼詢以若至決戰階段，政府軍是否能擊退共軍，白將軍謂：「迄至目前爲止，余尙未估計國軍需時幾許，能擊淡共軍」。白將軍力言「蔣主席及中央政府，雖在共方軍事挑撥性行動之下，仍不放棄綏靖政策。吾人當設法與共方和解，想在馬帥之協助下，必能達到此目的」。關於所傳政府已向共黨提出最後通牒，吿以若不放棄圍攻大同，國軍將進攻延安及張家口之說，白將軍謂尙未接獲準確情報，渠證實彭學沛部長所稱共軍調集一切兵力，已迫近大同近郊之語。</p>

<h3>中共呼籲動員聲中關內外共軍動態華北共軍分三大部活動</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿二日電〕共產黨疾呼全體動員以赴戰爭聲中，此間某熟悉共軍全般動態之某軍事當局，今就共（軍在關內外之配備及活動，加以論列，渠稱共產黨正規軍共約八十萬，除其中約四十五萬，配備於關外外，餘均散佈於華北各省，關外共軍經四平之役後，元氣大傷，其後即積極補充及整編，將恢復其原有力量，駐熱河者約十七個旅，赤峯承德該方面共軍，將有所行動，軍調部雖指令熱河三小組召開國共軍最高指揮官會議，但終將無成·至於東北能否繼續保持其粗安狀態，實不敢言，關於華北共軍，可分三大部，其一爲劉伯誠部約十七萬人，以太行山爲根據地，司令部設於武安附近之白岩村，現在之活動，即爲沿隴海路三百里之攻勢，但顯已受挫。其二爲賀龍部約五六萬人，以晋北爲根據地，司令部設於豐鎭，現在之活動爲圍攻大同，似相當得手，但其後果則未敢逆料。其三爲陳毅部，根據地爲魯東，司令部在臨沂，（一說已遷移）約十五萬人，現在之主要活動在蘇北。此外有聶榮臻部約三萬人，以張家口爲基地，而置其主要任務於維護察綏與東北之走廊，同時防禦傅作義向東開展，惟其一部近向大同南方應縣一帶移動，似圖與賀龍夾攻大同，觀此除東北外，關內所有共軍，均已發動，至於共軍之號稱正規軍一百廿萬，民兵二百萬，實乃誇大宣傳，民兵雖有相當數目，但均不堪一擊，共軍如有飛機，當不出二十架。</p>

<h3>政府重視農業建設工作　中美實行農技合作　鄒秉文抵滬談考察感想</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕中美農業技術合作團一行，已由華北，東北轉赴華西，華南考察。該團團長鄒秉文博士因另有要公，先行返京，昨晨抵滬，接見記者談：本團由中美農業技術專家組織，七月初由京出發考察。初赴北平，參觀敵營華北農事試騐塲，石家莊農事試騐分塲，及其他各項農業經營機構與設備；繼赴天津，參觀軍糧城附近之敵營墾殖事業，並與出口行商研討推進本國農產外銷事宜。五日由津赴昌黎，參觀敵營菓樹事業。十日抵瀋陽，參觀敵辦農科大學，及敵營農具股病品藥劑，血清等各大製造公司。十一日抵長春，參觀敵在　滿所設之興農部，大陸科學研究所，各類農業公司，並與當地農業技術人員（包括日本技術人員在內）作一詳細談話。十三日抵公主嶺，參觀敵營東北農事試騐廠，並與當地尙未遺歸之日技術人員略作談話，旋即由公主嶺返平轉赴西安。本人乃　團返滬，團務現由美方團長赫契生及我方副團長沈宗瀚主持，將由西安轉往成都，漢口，廣州，柳州，台灣，浙江等地視察，本人擬於九月二日前往漢口或廣州參加。本團預定於十月內考察完畢，返京後以六星期之時間趕編全部視察報吿。其時間支配：以兩星期完成初稿，兩星期與農林部及有關機關商討內容，最後兩星期改定初稿，作爲最後報吿。報吿內容分三部分：（一）中國農業建設方案，（二）改良特用農產品方案，（三）中美農業合作方案，以供當局施政參考。參加本團考察之美農業專家十人，預定於十一月十五日離華返國述職。又本團另派考察特用農產事業之茶葉，生絲，桐油，羊毛四小組人員，亦將於最短期間完成任務。</p>
<p>此行觀感</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>讀溥儀在東京供詞的感想</h3>
<p>東京國際法庭自五月間成立，開始審訊日本戰犯以來，其間迭有精彩塲面。然其足以引起一般世人之注意者，迄目前爲止，實無逾於傀儡皇帝溥儀之出庭作證。溥儀在該法庭所作供詞，坦白率眞，雖充分表現其爲一怕死偷生之懦夫，但我們細味其供詞，對日寇之蓄意侵略中國，及其在傀儡皇帝任內所遭遇之種種迫脅，能爲坦白之供述，對於日本戰犯罪行之確定及處決，實爲有力之佐證。現在溥儀在東京法庭的供述雖猶在進行，尙未終結，但就其已供述的部分，我們願申述其觀感如次：</p>
<p>第一，日本侵略中國，蓄謀已久，原爲一種有計劃的行動。它的侵占東北，本非偶發事件，主使操縱之者實爲日本的軍閥，特別是當時在東北的關東軍。溥儀在東京國際法庭的供詞，更證明了這一點。他說：「時關東軍司令官本莊繁派參謀板垣征四郞大佐來吿余，謂東三省張學良政權恣行苛政，陷人於苦難，日本之旣得權益，亦受侵犯，故擬驅逐軍閥，剷除共黨，建立新國家」；從而可知當時的關東軍如何蓄意破壞中國的統一，展開它對於中國的侵略。僞「滿洲國」的建立，本莊，板垣，土肥原等固應負責，但日本軍閥，縱有派系之分而實爲一個整體，故即不曾直接參加「滿洲事變」者，亦應負連帶責任。由於溥儀的坦白供詞，日本軍閥的蓄意侵略中國，實在罪無可逭；此次在東京受審的日本戰犯，如由國際法庭處以極刑，也是名正言順的事。</p>
<p>第二，溥儀之爲一個傀儡及可憐的低能兒，亦於他自己的供狀中，描述得歷歷如繪。他因爲不能「臨難毋茍免」，他因爲怕死而就不能顧全大義，充分表現了他低能的天性。他本身雖僅是一個傀儡，對於日本的統治東北及對於東北的榨取，自無法負其直接的責任，但他以中華民國的人民而甘爲日本軍閥的傀儡，破壞中國領土行政的完整，縱屬衡情不無可原，於法郤斷無可恕。此其行爲，自應使其在中國法律之前受公正的裁判。所以當我們循讀了溥儀在東京國際法庭的供詞以後，第二點使我們想起的，就是我們的外交部應該積極交涉，務期將溥儀及其附和叛國之徒，解歸中國法庭審辦。</p>
<p>查此次溥儀出庭東京作證，係在蘇聯當局監護之下，事前並與美軍當局約定，待作證結束後，仍須返回蘇聯；其在東京的時候，蘇聯當局對溥儀監護極嚴，禁其與人通話。溥儀以待罪之身，行動失其自由，原爲分內之事。但我們覺得不解的是，溥儀爲中華民國的罪犯，應受中國法律的制裁，蘇聯軍隊進據東北之際，將其監護，理應事後引渡中國，歸案法辦。據新聞社電傳消息，中國希望引渡溥儀，蘇方前曾允諾，目前復予保留；若果所傳不虛，殊足令人費解。我們在此地要正吿蘇聯當局，儘速將溥儀引渡中國法院，聽候中國法律的制裁。</p>
<p>溥儀是此次世界第二次大戰中最早出爲傀儡之人，由於溥儀的先導而後纔有中國的汪精衛，陳公博，及挪威的吉斯林，法國的貝當之流。在傀儡演化的歷史上，溥儀無疑是一個祖宗。然而當我們想起傀儡演化的歷史，以昔日的溥儀來看以後的汪精衛陳公博之流，誠不免有一代不如一代的感覺。溥儀天性低能而又怕死，他的出任傀儡，雖然構成罪行，但惟其他眞是十足道地的傀儡，故在他本人的良心上，想必是苦惱萬狀。他自己還能說老實話，承認自己的一無自由，甚至戰犯辯護人硬要說他接受僞職是爲向民國政府雪恨，是爲謀國民幸福，而他偏說「這是反宣傳」，可見他雖爲傀儡，但到了法庭上，還有國家民族的觀念流露於言詞之間。到了汪精衛之流，抗戰旣已開始，國策亦早決定，而且身在後方，又絕未受到什麼壓迫，乃中途自動退出抗戰陣營，投入敵人懷抱，是直賣國求榮，甘爲奴隸，與溥儀似不可同日而語了。至於其他等而下之的傀儡，先則覥顏事敵，迨至受到國法的審訊時，而又大發他們的漢奸議論，自圓其說，企圖卸罪，以視溥儀的坦白率直，更當羞慚無地！</p>
<p>還有使我們痛惡的是：汪精衛以後的那些新傀儡們！假如不顧人民公意，出賣民族利益，而甘願作外國人奴隸，這就是傀儡的詮釋，則我們不難想知誰是這些新傀儡們了。人民在戰後需要安定，國家民族需要一個休養生息的機會，但這些新傀儡們郤違反了人民的意向，出賣了民族的利益表面上掛起悅目的幌子，而裏面包藏了無盡的毒藥。他們的沒有自由，不能自作主張，怕還要甚於溥儀。我們看見這些曾經出賣中國民族利益的傀儡們，一個一個地被清算了，對於這些新生代的傀儡們，確信在民族獨立運動的高潮中，也終有被清算的一日。</p>

<p>〔本報綜合消息〕美國與南斯拉夫間之緊張關係，目前可謂已達最高潮。據合衆社華盛頓電，美國已於廿二日向南斯拉夫提出最後通牒，限於四十八小時內（即格林威治標準時問星期六上午三時，上海時間該日正午十二時以前，）將被擊落美機內之被扣飛行員全部釋放，送出邊境，否則，美國「即將請聯合國安全理事會立即開會，採取適當措置。」通牒內以極度嚴峻之口氣，駁斥南斯拉夫所謂此僅屬偶然之意外事件，並謂南斯拉夫政府係有意爲之，故對於此事必須負完全責任。此項最後通牒文字中充滿憤慨，措辭之嚴厲，爲珍珠港事件以來所罕見，指責南斯拉夫「公然進犯國際法及聯合國憲章」，有意襲擊美機，並稱南斯拉夫之解釋完全不能自圓其說，美國人民已皆不勝震怒。</p>
<p>該項最後通牒係代理國務卿艾克遜與遠在巴黎之國務卿貝爾納斯隔大西洋通長途電話兩次後而發出者。下午五時，艾克遜請南斯拉夫駐美代辦瑪凱度至其辦公室會晤，瑪氏到後，記者即羣集室前，兩氏於辦公室中閉門會談，五分鐘後，瑪氏即出，臉色慘白，全身發抖，於記者羣中急急衝出而去，僅謂「此事國務院可吿諸君。」按美國甫曾於星期二就此事提出嚴重抗議，現不等南國答覆，即下最後通牒，此點殊値得注意。衆信美國爲維持其國際之聲譽，已下定決心，與南斯拉夫拚個高下矣。</p>
<p>美國駐南斯拉夫大使柏特森，廿二日曾偕同軍事參贊等乘專機飛往南奧邊境之甘爾特，與正在該地避暑之蒂托元帥會商，衆信此當爲獲取南方對最後通牒反應之第一機會。惟據南斯拉夫發言人廿二日稱，蒂托元帥可能拒絕美國通牒中之要求。</p>
<h3>事關美國國際地位　貝爾納斯決心火併</h3>
<p>據合衆社巴黎電，貝爾納斯國務卿已準備將美國之國際地位及美國於和會中之成功，於此事上作孤注之一擲。貝氏認爲目前和會之結果若何，已不重要，但與南斯拉夫之火併，則必須勝利，因如果南斯拉夫擊下美機，而仍可以逍遙法外，似若無事，則美國整個軍事及外交之地位，勢必將遭受嚴重損害。</p>
<p>據和會中消息靈通方面人士稱：星期三貝爾納斯國務卿與南斯拉夫副總理卡達伊晤談時，卡達伊之能度甚爲「強硬無禮」，故使貝爾納斯感覺，美國對於南斯拉夫蒂托政府之耐心，已達終點，不能不發出嚴厲之最後通牒。時間一分一秒，漸漸過去，全世界之緊張心情，亦正與時俱增，如果四十八小時限期到後，南斯拉夫仍無圓滿答覆，則此事即將交由安全理事會緊急處置矣。</p>
<h3>蘇英兩國　保持緘默</h3>
<p>又據聯合社倫敦廿二日電，晚報昨日載稱，外相貝文可望於今日在巴黎會晤南斯拉夫外長卡狄吉，吿以「蒂托總統倘繼續引起搗亂，英南關係將受嚴重損害」。但關於美國致南國最後通牒一事，英國官方並無反饗。</p>
<p>又莫斯科報紙對於美國與南斯拉夫之爭執，予以刊載，惟不置評。</p>
<h3>韃靼尼爾問題　英土牒覆蘇聯</h3>
<p>〔本報綜合消息〕關於韃靼尼爾問題，據路透社倫敦電，英國照會已於廿一夜送交蘇駐英代辦，內容大致與照會相同，反對蘇土共同防衛此海峽之議。土耳其對蘇覆牒亦於廿二日遞送蘇駐土代辦，堅決表示不能接受蘇聯所提僅由黑海國家參加新談判之建議。土政府並絕對拒絕蘇聯得與土耳其共防此海峽之建議，但同意召開國際會議，由有關盟國共同參加討論此事，據稱，土國覆文係與英美大使洽商後所擬成。</p>
<h3>瑞典購置雷達　應付神秘飛彈</h3>
<p>〔路透社斯德哥爾摩廿一日電〕瑞典政府擬向英國購置雷達配備，以偵査落於瑞典境內之神秘飛彈，預料最近即可成交。</p>
<h3>管制多瑙河　英美成立委會</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿一日電〕哥白倫資電台宣稱：德國英佔領區內現已在竇斯堡地方，成立英美管制多瑙河及其支流航遝之聯合委會。所管制之範圍，自　斯堡至卡爾斯魯爾，計長一百八十哩，位於美國與法國佔領區之邊緣。</p>
<h3>蘇挪成立　邊界協定</h3>
<p>〔聯合社挪京廿一日電〕挪威外部今日宣稱：挪代表團於八月初赴莫斯科，已與蘇聯成立兩國邊界協定。挪威在戰前本與芬蘭接壤，自蘇聯兼併貝柴莫區後，挪威遂與蘇聯成爲比鄰。</p>
<h3>瑞士與蘇聯復交</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿一日電〕瑞士駐蘇公使弗魯克裘，本日到此履新，瑞蘇兩國最近恢復邦交以來，弗氏尙爲瑞士第一個外交代表。</p>
<h3>蘇利用德工廠　制造新武器</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林二十一日電〕柏林所獲自蘇車佔領區之極端可靠消息稱，蘇聯會同德國技術人員，在若干德兵工廠內正加緊製造新式V型武器，特種噴射推進式飛機·火箭彈·及其他重武器等。從事此等製造之工廠，至少有六家。蘇聯雖不許盟方入其兵工廠內調査，但悉，柏林之西門子廠及德律風根　·伍爾夫萊本之尼特沙森威克廠，以及克拉恩布登根廠，均在製造最新式V型武器之各種零件。克虜伯廠之馬德　分廠，則正在制造重武器運往蘇聯。薩克森尼省梅斯堡附近之　那大油廠，則在製造噴射推進式飛機之燃料，目前此等燃料之產量尙不甚多。</p>
<h3>蘇聯巡洋艦　開抵黑海港　加强對土神經戰</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿二日電〕據一交換電報」今日載稱，奧迪薩軍區蘇軍司令卓柯夫元帥及其參謀部，已乘蘇巡洋艦到達羅馬尼亞黑海港口康斯坦泰，此行乃羅馬尼亞及保加利亞蘇聯駐軍部隊巡行之開始，同時亦即加强對土耳其之神經戰。</p>
<h3>美艦九艘訪葡　基地談判急轉直下</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎廿二日廣播：美國最新式巨型航空母艦「羅斯福」號，廿二日駛抵直布羅陀海峽。</p>
<p>〔路透社里斯本廿一日電〕國與葡萄牙正式談判，使亞索爾羣島長期租給美國作爲軍事及航空基地之際，美艦八艘在航空母艦「羅斯福」號之率領下，適來此作親着之訪問，有人相信此舉可能使美葡談判有更肯定之轉變，美特別談判代表二人，即國務院西歐司長寇勃森及美陸軍大西洋空運組司令魯德少將，自七月十四日以來，即在此間商談，期使阿索爾基地問題，獲得滿意之解決。當美艦於上星期五駛抵此間時，正値談判漸陷停頓之際。主要之困難在於薩拉柴政府不願有足以損害葡帝國任何部份之主權之行動，此外尙有葡國人民在未來戰爭中之安全問題。美艦之訪葡，似巳完成下列之結果（一）使葡人對於航空有新的認識，（二）促進美葡兩國之感情，（三）使葡人了解基地之重要性，（四）可給予葡人若干安全之保證。</p>
<h3>和約修正案堆積如山　將開始審查工作　康納利昨午抵達巴黎　傳蘇要求聯合國大會延期舉行</h3>
<p>〔本報綜合消息〕據合衆社訊：和會各委員會可能於廿二日下午開始工作，審査和約草案及各方提出之修正案。晨間則舉行全體大會，俾廿一個會員國能就上一日六個非會員會陳述之意見，表示見解。希臘要求答覆阿爾巴尼亞之指責，殆屬勢所必然，而奧地利之要求收回南蒂洛爾，可能引起激辯。因此各委會能否獲得充份時間，着手實際工作，尙成問題。據聯合社電：（一）秘書處於廿二晨宣布，已自會員國代表團接到二百五十個基本修正案，（二）外長會議各代表對於和約內容有廿六個重大爭點，（三）五國和約草案計有兩百廿三條及無數款，五戰敗國備忘錄中所提出之對案，當在一百以上。預料討論各修正案時，需時必久，因此對和會之期限亦無從揣猜。傳莫洛托夫已致函聯合國秘書長賴依要求將原定九月舉行聯合國全體大會延至明年一月舉行，此說迄尙未獲證實。</p>
<p>本報收聽巴黎廣播：廿二日和會全體大會開會後，美國務卿貝爾納斯不久即離開會塲，與貝氏一起離場者有國務院東歐事務顧問巴赫侖，兩人曾就南斯拉夫問題詳細檢討。由此可知，美國對上述問題較和約審核工作尤爲重視。</p>
<p>又訊，美參議員康納利已於廿二日下午一時抵達巴黎。</p>
<h3>處置義屬地　南非要求發言權</h3>
<p>據路透社訊：南非總理史末資廿一日在和會中，要求對義殖民地之處置取得發言權，渠謂南非曾以人力物力，使義大利之非洲殖民地獲得解放，故在決定將該問題移交聯合國機構處決以前，亦必須徵求南非之意見。廿一日參加和會之英國及其自治領代表在貝文主持下舉行會議，到澳外長伊瓦特·加代表克拉克斯登，紐代表梅森等，貝文仍主張若四强不能決定義屬領之未來地位，應交聯合國機構決定，而史末資則認此事應由廿一國解決。澳外長伊瓦特廿一日宜稱：澳對和約草案已提出若干修正，俾使和約得與大西洋及聯合國憲章之規定更相接近。</p>
<h3>六小國陳辭　埃及主張利比亞獨立奧反對割讓南蒂洛爾伊請注意對盟國貢獻</h3>
<p>據聯合社訊：非和會會員國六國代表廿一日出席和會，發表一陣聲明與要求。阿爾巴尼亞·埃及·與奧地利三國代表，要求分割義領土，阿爾巴尼亞與埃及兩國並要求賠償。墨西哥與古巴則爲義大利辯護，要求「共同和平」。</p>
<p>茲將埃及·古巴·奧地利·伊朗代表所陳述之意見要點，節錄如下：埃及代表加里力言埃及對於一般和平，尤其是對義和約之重視，同時對於義國提出領土要求，如和會同意，則埃及與利比亞之界綫，將移至巴迪亞城迤西。似此一九二五年讓與義國之加爾波特綠洲自應劃歸索倫平原。此外埃代表又要求利比亞應即成立一獨立自主國古巴代表亞耶拉堅決要求承認此際出席和會及將來參加任何國際會議所有各國之地位絕對平等，並主張聯合國所有各國，均應參加和約起草工作。奧外長格魯倍爾謂，關於德奧合併事當時奧國如能自國外獲得援助，則對於　國進攻，必能予以抵抗。奧國大多數人民從未擁護德帝國主義之目標，聯合國解放奧國，誠使吾人感激，吾人除欲從事和平生活而外，別無其他願望。至於將蒂洛爾南部讓與義國一點，殊不合理。</p>
<p>伊朗代表賴希瑪稱，伊朗在此次對軸心國戰爭中，亦處於重要地位，尤其是開放伊朗邊界，聽由聯合國將物資運往蘇聯接濟作戰，厥功甚偉，故伊朗自應有權參加和約起草工作。伊朋代表團即將行抵巴黎，向和會充分說明其見解。據法國新聞社訊，伊朗代表團定廿二日啓程前往巴黎，團長爲國務部長塞巴布蒂。</p>
<h3>英埃談判之門　猶未完全關閉　雙方代表發表聯合文告</h3>
<p>〔路透社亞歷山大里亞廿一日電〕埃及拒絕英國所提修改英埃條約之建議，其覆文已於今夜發表。內稱：埃及代表團認爲獲自英方之建議及解釋，並不能使彼等改變其態度，故埃及代表團宣示將仍以一九四六年八月一日遞交英方之文件爲據，今日雙方代表團曾舉行一般性之討論，結果認爲雙方仍可交換新意見，俾完成與雙方均有利益之收獲。</p>
<p>又電：英埃談判雖似已陷於僵局，但雙方代表今日所發表之聯合文吿則謂：「交換意見之門仍屬開放」。另悉：埃及現仍堅持三星期前所提交倫敦之條件。按埃及於八月日所提之照會，有下述三大要點：（一）英軍應於締結條約後之一年內，退出埃及。（二）條約所規定設立之聯防委會，應純係諮詢性質，祇能由雙方同時召集，照會不得自動召開會議。（三）雙方政府應根據蘇丹與埃及統一之原則，談判英埃蘇丹之將來問題。其中以蘇丹問題爲最多困難，英國於埃及不願考慮其他原則之前，不擬以主權　予埃及。</p>
<h3>耶路撒冷充滿恐怖　猶人反英愈烈</h3>
<p>〔本報綜合消息〕巴勒斯坦問題，各方皆正等待即將在倫敦舉行之圓桌會議謀取解決。據路透社耶路撒冷電，阿拉伯高級委會定廿二日開會討論答覆英政府關於參加倫敦會議之邀請。外傳該會可能要求派遣前耶路撒冷回敎長赫賽尼，爲未來倫敦會議中阿拉伯代表團長，但英官方對於此事已正式表示，如是阿拉伯高級委會，作此建議英方定將拒絕。</p>
<p>同時巴勒斯坦之情勢，目前仍在緊張及恐佈混亂之中。據路透社電，猶太激烈份子廿一日在巴勒斯坦街上散發傳單，謂如果前被捕之猶太靑年恐怖份子十八人被執行死刑，則「巴勒斯坦街上將滿染英人之血」。</p>
<p>本報收聽倫敦廣播：耶路撒冷街道，廿二日自晨至午，軍車開駛不絕，重要地區皆遍佈鐵絲電網及沙袋，街上時時發現匿名通吿，謂將襲擊某機關建築，故各主要建築前現皆有軍警嚴密警戒。據息，郊外英軍駐紥頗多，凡此種種似皆顯示耶路撒冷正處於暴風雨之前夕。</p>
<h3>美向聯合國機構　提領土報告　根據憲章爲各國表率</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿一日電〕美國今日率先以其領地及島嶼屬地情形，向聯合國機構提出長篇報吿書，因此英屬地及荷屬東印等區域之報吿書亦可繼之提出。政府此舉係依照憲章規定，即會員國應以其領土內尙未達到充分自治人民之經濟及社會敎育情形，提出報吿。美國爰將阿拉斯加·夏威夷·彼多黎谷·處女羣島·巴拿馬運河區·關島·美屬薩摩亞島·及太平洋各島嶼情形呈報。據英代表團發言人稱，渠尙未接到倫教方面草擬該項報吿之消息，但各會員國並無在一九四七年以前提出報吿之義務。聯合國方而人士估計，全世界附庸人民居住於此種非自治領土內者，佔總數百分之八。</p>
<h3>捷克宣布承認　西共和政府</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社布拉格廿一日電〕此間電台廣播：捷克政府本日已承認西班牙共和政府，此項照會已由捷駐法大使摩塞克面致西共和政府總理季拉爾，吿以捷克承認其政府爲西班牙唯一合法政府。</p>
<h3>印回教徒再度衝突　死傷四十餘人　白部長對印局表示關切</h3>
<p>〔聯合社孟買二十一日電〕印度敎徒與回敎徒今日又在皮哈爾及阿薩兩省發生衝突，死四人傷廿餘人。彭加爾省亦有四人被刀戳死，十二人受傷。回教徒及印度敎徒領袖今日一致譴責加爾各答流血暴動，同時軍隊及義勇隊則在收拾三千罹難者之最後一批屍體，當局正在疏通糧食來源。一部份觀察家相信暴動不致使組織臨時政府之努力遭受挫折。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社新德里二十一日電〕國大黨領袖尼赫魯本日談稱：加爾各答暴動事件，應由孟加拉省政府負責，該省當局非但不採取任何步驟，預防或制止暴動，反而推波助瀾，鼓勵暴徒。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京二十一日電〕國防部長白崇禧乃中國三千萬回敎徒中之一人，頃對加爾各答最近之流血暴動，極表關懷。並相信印度雖在混亂之中，尙能獲得完全之獨立與國家之統一。</p>
<h3>日民法修正　削減家長權利　提高婦女地位</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿二日電〕日政府已採取初步行動，取締家庭中之家長獨裁制，此種制度屢被攻擊爲民主之障礙。依照新憲法賦予個人之權利，民法已修改完成。新民法削减家長之權力，提高婦女法律上之地位。婦女與丈夫平等，不再視爲家庭之附庸，遺產以前限於傳給長子，此後可任父母選擇。</p>
<h3>暹羅政局　撲朔迷離　新王遇刺説不確　巴諾榮內閣突然辭職</h3>
<p>〔路透社盤谷廿一日電〕暹羅攝政團今日發表文吿，正式否認暹王遇刺之說，暹王年方十八，因健康關係已星期一乘飛機赴瑞士，警察宣佈星期日午夜有未獲准許之人一名進入王宮，聲稱欲見國王，該人未携武器，顯見神經錯亂，已予扣押。</p>
<p>〔聯合社盤谷廿二日電〕暹羅總理巴諾榮今日辭職，因「反對者陰謀，損害本人康健，並破壞本人及內閣之服務」。暹王刻在赴瑞士遊覽途中，巴諾榮突然辭職，令人極感驚奇。此間政界人士相信，外長査雅南咸司法部長納瓦薩伐，咸將受命出組新政府，兩人均係勢力最大之立憲黨黨員。</p>
<h3>蘇聯圖衝過海峽　土耳其幕后美英列陣相對　重要性超出和會任何問題</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿二日電〕巴黎和會開幕以來喧鬧之厲害，若與西方各國與蘇聯之衝突相比較，實渺乎其微；當前衝突正在緊閉的外交部門後，以古典的外交手腕進行。各大國對於世界最古的政治問題之一即海峽問題，正作神經戰，因此一問題觸及蘇聯三世紀半以來之最大抱負，並足以決定中東之控制權，故其兇惡性，遠過於巴黎發展之其他一切問題。其他各國，自十九世紀初葉以來，一部份國家且在此時之前，即爲海峽問題折衝。在第一次與第二次世界大戰期間，美國未有動作，但美國對於包含全世界力量轉移之任何競爭，不能袖手旁觀，蘇聯已向韃靼尼爾海峽之保衛者土耳其提出要求，此項要求非土耳其或西方各國所能接受。要求中第一點，即由黑海各國接收海峽管理權，第二點蘇土兩國接收海峽防務。所謂黑海各國即保加利亞，蘇聯及土耳其，首兩國成爲一體，土耳其在任何海峽會議中似將永處於少數者地位。以第二點而論，蘇聯將與土耳其共同軍事佔領海峽沿岸。此項要求如被接受，等於實現三世紀半前彼得一世以來蘇聯歷屆統治者之夢想，彼得大帝決心衝破陸地與冰面之桎梏，直通溫水地帶，彼得大帝之任何繼任人，其所憧憬者，無如史達林今日之美滿。波羅的海現大部份在蘇聯懷抱之中，蘇聯已在東方不凍港旅順與大連恢復其權力。千島列島之佔有，證明蘇聯已進入太平洋，目下則蘇聯勢力正向地中海與波</p>
<h3>美蘇衝突主因　在於爭奪油區</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿一日電〕據負責人士談稱：美國至一九六五年時其平時正常之汽油消耗，將有半數須自國外輸入，此足以說明美國在中東　北極圈所採政策之一部份緣因斯灣出以重大壓迫，美英法已在土耳其幕後列陣，反對蘇聯衝過海峽。美國準備分負韃靼尼爾海峽之和平管制計劃尙係初次。其他各國所焦慮者即蘇聯對其要求堅持至若何程度，史逹林準備壓迫至何時，此舉是否爲攤牌或僅爲討價還價之開始，其答復中所能窺見之世界和平，實較巴黎和會迄今成就者爲多也。。美國人造汽油之生產，尙不敷應用，故美國政府公開支持某汽油公司，在中東獲得油田開採權，美國對於韃靼尼爾海峽，巴勒斯坦以及中東局勢表示特別關切，最近美國又採取防衛措置，舉行海軍演習，並定於本年冬季在北極區舉行演習，以防來自阿拉斯加之攻擊，均可於此獲得解釋，蘇聯目前缺乏汽油，正擬攫取羅馬尼亞及奧地利亞之油田，並企圖在伊朗北部及中東獲得油田開採權，要之，油田問題具有極大之政治重要性在焉。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿一日電〕星期六晚上國務院官員在無綫電廣播中所發表關於國際合作開發世界油源之建議，美國各報對之，均加以擁護，並力促迅速採取步驟以期實行。華盛頓郵報稱：「國務院官員主張由聯合國管制世界油田資源之開發，實爲美國外交政策有希望之發展，欲免戰爭必須去除戰爭之原因，而世界油量供應，缺乏管理之競爭，即爲戰爭之潛在原因。」</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕勝利已逾一載，水陸交通依舊未見恢復，考其主要之原因，當不外軍公運輸之忙繁，致對商運未能暢通。國營招商局復業以來，力謀維持航綫，惟因差遣忙碌，一切計劃未能實行。最近該局船務處，將南北洋錢船舶重行調配，茲將各綫派定之船隻錄後：南洋錢，派漢民，延　，仲愷，培微四輪行駛，廣州爲終點。滬榕（福州）錢：派鄧鏗，林森二輸行駛。北洋錢：派執信，其美，黃興三輪行駛，以天津爲終點。北洋綫中再闢滬靑（靑島）連（大連）綫，滬靑津綫，派海冀行駛靑連綫，海蘇行駛靑津綫。又滬台（台灣）綫，派海浙，海康，海黔三輪行駛，另派蔡鍔，海贛，海鄂，海滇，海川，海桂六輪爲不定期班，輔助各踐運輸。該局對廈門，廣州，香港三分局，爲便利商運起見，各派一輪全權管轄，船隻亦已指定，海皖輪歸廈門分局，海粵輪撥廣州分局，海閩輪交與香港分局。據該局船務處稱：上項調配之船舶，如無軍公運輸之阻欄，切實實行上項計劃，各棧均可暢通。</p>

<h3>中央航空公司奮鬥成功　遷滬七個月盈利六十億　現有航綫六條　計劃展至國外</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕龍華機塲上，目前有兩個航空公司，一是中美合辦的「中國」，一是純粹國人經營的「中央」。</p>
<p>當吾四年前正式對德宣戰以後，中德合辦的歐亞航空公司，爲交通部接收改組。當時所有的是容克式五二型運輸機四架，自昆明飛行桂林·重慶·香港等地，並不定期飛航西北哈密·迪化·蘭州。可是太平洋戰爭一起，便被日太空軍炸燬，只剩了一架。也已超過了飛行年齡。</p>
<p>此時在中國商業航空界，有三四個歷史悠久的飛行家，爲了發展中國急迫需要的商業飛行事業，商准了交通部，組織成「中央航空公司」。他們向航委會，撥到了一架日本「九七」式轟炸機，不定期飛翔在成都與各重要城市間，協助政府運輸貨物，以後又絡織得到了三四架洛開特式輕轟炸機。這些，在他們少數幾個人努力奮鬥下，雖還差可應付，却全不是適宜的商航機。</p>
<p>一九四五年秋，勝利降臨，美軍在印度遺下大量剩餘物資。「中央」也購得了十一架美軍用機，「中央」的五位靑年飛行家親自駕駛那批飛機，自印度飛越喜馬來雅山的駝峯，抵達昆明。那時適値政府復員之初，交通工具缺乏，造成了發展商業航空的空前機會。他們五個人輪流着每天起飛，緊張熱烈的在中國商航這塊荒地上開墾。去年耶誕前後，又從昆明遷來上海，在龍華機塲佔了一席地。</p>
<p>苦心孤詣的奮鬥，終於並未使他們失望，今日已擁有七十架可航的旅客運輸機，在經常飛航中者凡二十架。尙有新購的美軍剩餘飛機百餘架，目前正停歇江灣機塲在整理中。</p>
<p>飛行人員已增加到十四人，仍在不斷添聘中，至本年底止，將有美空軍中的華僑飛行員二十餘人，待退任後，即來訂約加入。從美國受訓歸來的航空人員亦將有二十人應聘。</p>
<p>目前的主要航綫共有六條；滬昆·滬渝·滬平·滬港·以及最近開闢的上海蘭州，上海西安兩綫。在計劃中的，他們還　延長華南航綫至越南及盤谷，將香港綫延展至菲列賓，便利南洋各地僑胞與祖國間的交通。</p>
<p>「中央」遷滬七個月以來，毛利總額已達國幣六十億元，是交通部管轄下唯一獲利的交通事業。這一筑龐大的盈利，他們便用來購置新機，購辦地上設備，交通工具，地上人員也已激增至一千二百餘人，每月支出的薪水總額達二億元。</p>
<p>但是，機航組主任與總飛機師，並不以此自滿，他們全如此說：「我們的目的，並不在於圖利，我們只有一個唯一的目標，爲中國拓展航空事業，盡每一分的努力，爲未來進展奠下一個基石，並以事實來向全世界證明：國人具備着單獨經營航空綫的技術與能力。」</p>
<p>目前他們還有急待克服的兩大困難：（一）缺乏建築物機庫等設備，不能與天天在膨脹中的航空事業相削合，無法容納如許數量的新機，同時一個現代化的航空港，更是他們日夕的期待。（二）購置新機及地上設備時所付之一筆鉅大的海關稅，加重了他們的負祖。這種種困難，現已向賢明的當局在請求援助中。</p>
<p>中國商業航空在能華航空港孕育長成，現在即將跨開大步，向前邁進了！遼闊的中國曠野，是他們未開墾的處女地，整個世界是他們的戰塲，他們的成功是可以期待的！</p>

<p>免稅貶值後　出口貨多漲價　桐油豬鬃可勉強行銷　羊皮腸衣蛋無法出口　　〔本報訊〕昨據若干出口業中入語記者稱：政府此次調整匯率，首受其惠者，　爲一般生產出口物品之農民，及持貨之商家。出口商方面，十九皆係居間代理性質，離未能直接受惠，惟望因提高匯率後，我出口品外銷之價絡能逐步趨廉，則出口商業務，易於着手經營。然以日來桐油猪鬃等各主要出口品而言，其價格顯較未調整匯率前，已騰漲數成。以桐油言，調整匯率前之市價，每担約七萬元。近兩日來，喊價已達十一二萬元一担。目前美國之桐油市價，每磅約爲美金三角六分。折算之下，大致合我國市價十萬元一担。而南美洲阿根廷一帶，現亦有桐油生產。品質較次，數量不多。惟開價僅美金兩角一分一磅。美國本身，刻亦有桐油之代用品生產。故如我國桐油市價，昂騰不已，則必致喪失在美之市塲。甚望我國桐油商，有所警惕。再以猪鬃而言，調整匯率前之市價，每担約三十五萬元。近兩日已步漲至五十五萬元一担。猪鬃在美國之市價，四鋼月前，因貨缺價俏，曾一度高至每磅美金三元五角。近已步跌至每磅美金二元。折合我國市價，約合六十萬元一担。故以目前情形言，桐油猪鬃之出口，尙不致發生價格過高之困難。羊皮一項，調整匯率前，約爲十六萬元一担，近已漲至二十五萬元一担。目前世界　普遍缺乏牛羊皮張，美國對羊皮開價，達美金八角一磅。惟如以國內廿五萬元一担之市價折算，，成本約合美金一元一磅。故羊皮之出口，已感勉强。他如腸衣，因國內價格過高，品質又乏標準，出口　有做開。蛋品出口，以我國戰後生產量，急遽减少。自身供應，尙有不數。且價格又高，在國外普遍採取糧食限價制度之下，遂根本無從出口。據稱：自匯率調整後，各持有出口品之商家，均按提高匯率之比率，及免除出口稅之數額，紛紛將各項出口品加成漲價。深望漲價應有限度，切勿影響於原有之外銷價格。蓋日來各　進口商，頗抱觀望。並紛紛來電，要求减低售價。現聞我國出口商方面，方擬聯合維持各項出口品原開外銷價格，俾免調整匯率後所予出口品之利益，又因外銷價格之降跌，而吿消失。同時，深望出口品國內價格之提高，足以刺激一般農民之再生產能力，從而使出口品之成本及價格普遍逐步低落，然後再求逐步抑低出口品之國外市價云。　　金鈔市情穩健　港滙成交獨多　　烚赤昨平穩萬分，晨開二二〇萬有賣，時局尙形緩和，浮多有所脫手，壓力仍重，低價曾盤低至二一五萬八，中央銀行即以二一五萬五之價配給九七條，十時後漸形平穩，廣幫略有納胃。漸告微升，過程則極爲平庸，午刻已回升至二一七萬以上，午後自二一八萬又復微降至二一六萬五光景，結果較前收下降二萬二，飾金念二萬八，紋銀平而銀元升，暗拆不定，息價自一角二分至一角半不等，經數日來黃金大量賣出，已漸見緊。　　外幣極度穩健，惟過程以港幣最爲吃香，美鈔晨開三四一〇元賣，三三八〇買，開後曾扳高少許，三四〇〇元有求，終以金市趨低，亦難再越三四三〇元以上，入後始終在三三八〇元至三四一〇元之間徘徊，午後仍在三三八〇元至三四〇〇元之間掙扎，結果較前收微降二十元，港票以港申電報縮至一三七元，籌碼不多，易升難降，自七〇〇起一路買過於賣，升至七五〇元以上，結果較前收再升三十元，港匯七五〇元左右，印匯九〇〇元，英匯一萬二，港匯成交最多，美匯仍站牌價。黃金價格　英人謂不至提高　　〔路透社倫敦廿一日電〕經濟日報頃爲文評論外間謠傳世界金價可能提高一事，謂此事絕無可能，蓋世界金價如果增高，必須爲美國調整其財都買價，但目前財部買價仍爲三十五元，不久前雖有傳言謂將提高至五十六元，但此事早成過去，新財長不願將金價提高，一若其前任之兩財長然。至於英國，則亦絕未作提高金價之考慮。債市投機又盛　　統丙做一千三百元外　　公債向榮之幻想復起，操業者買意殷切，統丙晨開九六〇元，此價即遭大宗游資所追逐，一再爭買，扶搖直上，投機氣息復濃，頗多出冷進熱之套買活動，統丙竟漲到一三五〇元以上，頂價結束，統戊自八六〇步升至一〇五〇元以上，結果較前收甲乙微升五十元，統丙激漲四百元，丁種升一二〇元，統戊亦漲一九〇元。登記之偽儲劵　儘九月內補兌　　僞中儲劵未兌餘額，前經中央銀行辦理登記，業於本年四月截止，頃悉：近奉財部命令，該行規定自九月一日起至三十日止，爲兌換日期，凡各登記人，應於限期內，持該行出給之收據，向原登記行換取法幣，逾期不再兌換。鹽貸與押滙不受緊縮影響　　外匯調整後，三行兩局放款，奉上峯指示，應暫行緊縮，據悉昨日四聯分處例會曾提出討論，並經決定暫行辦法四項：（一）鹽貸：因目下鹽貸銀行業已成立，而鹽商需款孔亟，爲維持鹽運，擬繼續辦理。（二）押匯：爲調劑各地物資疏通計，仍擬繼續辦理。（三）已經總處核准各戶，正在洽辦貸款手續者，仍擬繼續辦理。（四）其餘放款，一律緊縮，　　茶商貸款月息三分　　最近茶葉業有中國茶葉貿易公司，華茶公司，及汪裕泰向中農銀行申請貸款，總數在十億元以內，同時由中央銀行承做轉抵押，在外滙調整後，出口商利益稍優之際，已將利息改至月息三分。茶葉貨物稅　當業求豁免　　〔本報訊〕據悉：本市各茶葉業輸出商，以目前經營茶業，所負担之各項賦稅，如營業稅，所得稅，印花稅等，已相當繁重。乃見中央近頒發貨物稅條例，對茶葉一項，又將課稅百分之十。故於日前一度集會，擬電呈當局，要求豁免該項百分之十之貨物稅，以利茶葉之外銷云。白煤市況堅穩　　陽泉白煤塊及小子煤，商業聯合營處有派貨，價較前市略低，計陽泉篩塊四十噸，每噸四十萬元，陽泉小子四十噸，每噸三十八萬元，然供不敷求，未經數分鐘即行全數認訖，同業成交價，陽泉篩塊仍爲四十四五萬元，市勢依然俏俐，烟煤塊市價略見微升，烟煤　廠銷，亦有推動。　　金菜步升　　金針菜以近到較稀，而去化反形活動，故開價一再上漲，昨市上貨開二十萬元，次十八九萬元，據徐州函訊亦回升二三萬元。糖市交易停頓　　前昨兩日，糖業公會因恐糖價過份激漲，故公開交易均吿停頓，其他客貨，行號間直接略有做開，如白糖鬆後略有回好，靑糖則以產價續緊，前後好起一成之譜。米市場消化不良　配出洋米店方並無進胃　　昨日南北市塲到米，共計四千二百餘石，又一六四〇包，米號業自運自銷者計二七八石，總共四千五百餘石。又一六四〇包，米市消化已轉入呆不之狀，洋米依然續配，奈店方竟無進胃，粳米高貨尙定，中次回小二三千元，白元亦跌二三千元，新粳小一二千元，秈米新陳各貨亦居高定次疲之格，麵粉以內地雜牌來貨甚多，消胃平常，洋粉亦有出售，市形略見軟化，小麥北方去化轉淡，白麥形勢平正，汕厦納取不旺，甬幫略取，中次稍覺回平，黃豆來源益稀，市形明定暗緊，閩方選高略有問津，蠶豆存到不多，見挺五六百元，黃蔴回小千元，油市到消兩接，配油續售，人心平定，早堅午疲，豆餅汕頭略有交易，存底已枯，上漲四五百元。新藥業苦悶　進口稅太低　拆息又太高　　〔本報訊〕自外匯率調整後，咸以爲外貨進口可减少，而國貨產品可暢銷，昨據本市某著名西一樂廠負責人語記者，事實上並不如此簡單，緣外匯率提高百分之六十五後，非僅外國運華之西藥製成品進價增高，即初製品咸西藥原料，亦已同時增漲，再加本市製藥商耗於利息者極鉅，故國貨西藥之銷路，一時仍未許樂觀。舉例言之，美國利率極低，每月每百元僅需利息二角五分，而我國須付出十二元。前述之藥廠每月所付利息竟達一億餘元，即其一例。再進口西藥製成品之關稅，爲進價百分之三十，而原料關稅爲百分之二十五。相差僅百分之五，廠商頗難。華股形勢恍惚　熱門跌冷門漲　　華股昨仍恍惚，由高而低，大戶初進後出，各股中途最堅，永紗六八五，美亞四〇二〇元，景福二三二元，新光二三七元，勤興一七八元，不久即遭出籠所壓迫，盤旋而降，惟美亞有大銀行吸收，較其他各股形勢爲優，較冷各股漸有投資活動，形勢緩進，近午低價永紗六五〇元，美亞三六八〇元，景福二一三元，新光二二三元，勤興一六〇元，結果較前收計永紗美亞景福勤興都吿微降，僅新光尙吿穩定，較冷各中小型股除世界平平外，餘者均好起半成左右，元老股亦稍微進。　　外股昨有廣幫斬售而吿回跌，怡紗自九三〇〇元，英聯九四〇〇元，逐漸下游，其他各股亦疲落難振，午刻最低，結果較前收計怡紗英聯鋼業各跌一成左右，餘者亦小半成光景獲益，同時今後匯率若竟影響一般生活必需品之漲便，從而影響及於人工等生產費用，則西藥製造廠所受威脅將益巨。故目前最希望者厥有二點：（一）低貸，如此得有充分資金供運用。（二）提高進口西藥成品關稅，以保護國產西藥之出路。張學良已呈准恢復邊業銀行　　〔天津廿一日電〕據悉：張學良私人經營之邊業銀行，因其個人環境關係，停業已久，張於勝利後，呈請財政部復業，已獲批准。據與張氏熟習之銀行界人士談，張函已到津，謂最近即派代表北來，轉往東北，接收敵僞時期被侵佔之私人財產，並由該代表在津決定邊業銀行復業日期。賣戶扳價太堅　茶銷不易成議　　査連日印莊吸收之合灣細紅茶，因供應奇缺，致過程岺靜，至於陳抽珍，陳珍眉等外銷花色，持者心思亦堅，其他各茶均不乏有人蒐羅，但賣扇一味扳俏，喊價漫無止境，故雙戶之談判雖未中止，但局勢終又僵持。糖類完稅後　照閩浙例貼印照　手續較繁貨照可相符　　〔本報訊〕市商會爲奉稅務署電後，關於糖類納稅轉運事宜，特據情函覆本市糖商公會，原函略云：案奉稅務署代電開，査前據該會本年四月十六日代電，以糖類完納統稅後，包件上所貼印照，經在運輸途中，輾轉搬運，脫落模糊，在所難免，請於完稅後，免貼印照，概憑完稅照運行，並飭稅局對於糖類報騐及申請分運手續，力求簡化等情，當以糖類究納統稅後，貼用印照，所以證明其爲已稅貨品，亦即保護正當商人利益，如僅憑完稅照運行，不予粘貼印照，則該項貨品是否即爲完稅照所載之貨品，無法證明，易啓舊照重用之弊，於商運査騐，均感困難，唯台灣光復以來，台糖內銷數量頗鉅，上海爲集散；岸，此項糖類，係於海關代征統稅後，由上海貨物稅局發貼印照，來電所陳貼照困難各點，　　電飭該局査明妥議救濟，並代　該會各在案，茲據上海貨物稅局電復，糖類包裝，大都以蔴袋居多，過去閩浙各省產糖地方，爲恐糖斤轉運時溶化，並避免印照模糊脫落起見，均採用在印照粘貼處縫蓋蔴布一方，雖商人稍感麻煩，而報運査騐，交相便利，如能一致倣行，則印照模糊脫落之弊，均可免除，至臺糖運滬雖多，自經台灣糖業公司統運統銷後，已洽請於商人承購時計件發給印照，並將印照號碼註明於分運申請書內，以憑塡發分運照，故於報運査騐時，即無貨照不符，及乎續困難情事等情，査該局所擬貼照補救辦法，核尙可行，仰即知照，並轉行糖業公會知照等因，特錄電轉達，即希査照分轉爲荷。倫敦中國債券跌價　　〔路透社倫敦廿一日電〕今日證券市場情形，外國債券大都穩定，但中國債券則由於中國國內政局之不平靖，下跌一鎊至二鎊。紗布銷路大暢　棉紗廠盤雖低供售太少　紡建開布亦感粥少僧多　　昨日紗市　見高　，津粵等帮去化仍　，同行吸　亦勁，是以雙馬一度哄至一百六十二萬，然敦市回至一五八萬，其餘各支，無不飛漲五萬至十萬，廠盤難低，，奈無供售，是以一般須貨者，莫不放價搜現，本街門銷亦漸活絡，前法大馬路之門市店，對中小型之廿支十六支，搜求不遺餘力，紗市前途，方興未艾。　　布市又復趨昂，人心一致望高，天津，漢口，四川，等帮相繼採辦，紛紛收進嗶嘰，結果漲五百元至一千二百五十元，紡建公司售盤未加，同業爭購，交進承購單多至數千張，一時無法處理，須延至今晨方可分發Ｖ龍頭價僅五萬七千五百元，老嗶嘰爲五萬六千元，其他布價與上期開價相仿。燒碱走勢甚俏　持貨者不願脫手　　化工原料，週來受外匯放長影響，各貨平均漲上三四成，其他因無實銷，成交甚少，僅燒碱有人問津，交易甚多，據某進口行云，馬尼刺每桶售美金一百五十元，香港每桶港幣七百元，美國每桶一百零五元五角，藥國交貨再加出口證水脚關稅等，而且不易大量運出，所以目前持有現貨者，均不願脫手，據業中人云，嗣後再向外洋定購，成本與現市價相差無幾，所以自動停止向美國定購。免除出口稅　下月起可實施　　自政府宣佈調整外匯，並決定免除出口稅後，各界對此，深爲興奮，茲據江海關方面宣稱，出口稅之免除，約於九月一日起可開始實施，至進口稅率，聞亦將改訂尙在商討考慮中。元色貨獲利獨厚　德孚存薄恒信已有退貨　染料顏料大部並未漲價　　〔本報訊〕染料顏料，爲主要進口貨之一，自外匯變動，除少數熱門貨外，售價尙能平定，染廠方面，因內地實銷稀少，亦無敢抬價收購者，昨日西顏料業同業公會集議，除決議催報所得稅外，爲協助政令平穩物價起見，對於同業動態，將加緊注意，據當業消息，已定成之染料顏料朱到埠者尙多，將來照新匯價結價，自不免受到影響，好在有若干種類，目下有相當利潤，統扯計算，所漲亦有限制，並據指稱，染料顏料之進口關稅，爲從價百分之十五至三十五不等，外匯旣變，來本必增，應納之稅，當然亦加，則同業原本有關，公會亦可加以維護云，消息靈通者指陳，染料顏料定貨之最賺錢者，莫過於熱門之元色貨，照目前售價，較來本超過三四倍不等，雖說定威數月，墊本拆息可觀，但究係獲利獨厚，縱以新匯價計算，亦不應漲價云，德孚洋行方面，傳稱該行存貨甚薄，元色等低檔熱門貨，早已派完，聞恒信洋行方面，近將一二個前客家所來之定單，退還大部份，據一般觀察，染料顏料應設法獎勵進口，俾加工複興之工業，得免於停工云。</p>

<p>台省清查團談接收  本報十九日臺北航訊　特派員江暮雲　　在圓山怪幽靜的第二賓館裏，記者會見了接收處理敵僞物資淸査團劉文島團長和各委員。　　　委員松一說，本團的任務，積極地在淸査接收後的物資和工廠的處理情形，消極地在接受人民的檢舉和控訴，對於若干本省人的苛責接收，是不能一概而論的。他指出基隆肥料工廠以四月之時間從破壞迅速地恢復開工，來說明這是一個例子。　　帶病的劉文島團長，他邀我利用早膳的時間隨便詢問，他說因爲人員少，差不多每天辦公在十六小時以上，接著他又說現在收到密吿信一百二十件，舉發貪汚的約九十件，另外都是各種建議，這些案件需要詳密調査提供具體證件，方可交司法機關辦理。他帶笑的對記者說：「我們不能做不準確的原吿啊！」關於台灣的現實，他未便表示意見，不過他堅信台灣是有前途的是可以樂觀的。經濟，敎育條件都比國內各省好，只要有定期航輪，和東南沿海各省一接通，可充分發展貿易。　　據祝秘書　吿記者，該團將於二十日赴新竹，合中，台南，高雄等地，接受人民的控訴，爲期十天，預定在本省躭留一月後轉閩。談及本省人與外省人的隔膜時，他說，這一個口號應該轉變到好人與壞人上去，好人蒙西子不潔之名，影響了工作，這是臺灣的損失，而壞人則須盡量舉發，始稱公允。不過這過渡現象，政府與民間的隔膜，希望能把時間的距離縮到最短限度。　　長官語不成聲　　上海閩台各團體要求改革本省政制後，反映在台灣的是：　　（一）宣傳會主委夏濤聲指出大惑不解處：所謂閩台各團體，實際多數爲閩省旅滬團體，赴京請願代表，也都是閩人，台灣爲一省，並非福建的殖民地，吾人誠不知此一二無聊的福建人，何以配干涉台灣事？　　（二）日產處理會主委嚴家淦，說明接收日資企業經營方針，實現民生主義。　　（三）陳長官堅具非將現有政策貫澈到底不行的決心，他在某一個集會上說：台灣弄不好，也就是整個中國弄不好。在福建七年四月的施政並沒失敗，深信在台省實行總理遺敎是於國族民生都有利的。長官今年六十四歲，每天八時辦公，下午七八時離去，捨己奉公，當他談到這樣刻苦地做還有人反對他時，已語不成聲！　　參議員大包圍　　光復後台省首次參政員八名的選舉，十六日在省參議會舉行。候選人四十一名，開票結果除林獻堂·林忠·林宗賢·羅萬俥等四人當選外，另外的却發生了問題。十三票的廖文毅，有一票寫得不能辯認，還有其他兩人，是寫錯字的，監票人民政處長周一鶚根據法理聲明要予取消一票，若干參議員却堅持仍爲合法，他們中甚至說：「政府不能干涉選舉，」雙方相持了四小時，未能解決，民政處長被包圍得却够苦了，結果是除票數較多的四位決定以外，六人（內有五人同爲十二票）將呈中樞核定，因爲陳長官也不能決定省內選舉的事。　　人們說本省人誤解民主，其實是過於廣泛地運用了民主，他們會與政府官吏力爭，他們正多方設法製迭民主的現實，企圖實現省長各市縣長以下的民選，打破目前臺省政治經濟諸般的　結！　　財政借債度日　　台省的財政，現在是借債度日！　　會計處長玉肇嘉的報吿是：（一）歲入歲出總預算二十四億，收支情形截至本年七月底止，不敷約七億餘元。（二）本年墊付款爲五億餘元，連同去年的四億餘元，共約九億餘元。（三）歲出應付款除以歲入應收款三千餘萬元抵償外，尙不敷二億餘元。以上共短少約十四億餘元，全部由借款項下抵充，借款總數十七億餘元，除了抵充前面各項費用外，結算庫存，尙有二億餘！　本省第一期稻作登塲後，照理米價可以平抑，事實上却相反，現在已盤旋到十六元上下。造成糧荒現象，據糧食局長李連春表示，一是走私，二是囤積。目前走私地方有台中的梧　，新竹的公司寮，台南的布袋等，此外有淡水，台南等。警務處胡處長說明督導査緝結果，新竹方面的走私，不若台南厲害，査到的台中有走私米一〇八包，囤積米九七五包，榖六五包糖一三一包，台南走私案十二次，米六一八包，蕃薯乾一六〇包，菉荳四一包，米荳三七包。　　這樣的査緝是否平抑了平價呢，事實上吿訴人們，米價還大扶搖直上。　　眷屬的悲喜劇　　台省公務人員最近靡不期望和國內一樣，薪水能予調整，可是調整還只在計劃，而在內地的眷屬補助費，則決於十月份起取消了。陳長官再三希望眷屬都能來台！　　陳長官說這話，一般人都認爲針對現實的，所謂現實者，就是若干公務人員到台灣來以後，事業沒有成就，却已納了外室小星之類，或是成了家。他們的對象是女職員或甚至是下女。在某部裏，有三個本省的女打字員，不多久都成了「眷屬」，主管長官不得不下令「嗣後任何男職員，不准入打字室」，而報上在結婚啓事之外，又常能發現到某某女士被遺棄或自殺的新聞，這不是什麽風紀，而是成了風氣。內地和台省人結合，是否有問題，還沒被人提起。因爲當局原先限制帶眷屬，以致公務員另找「眷屬」，要是現在眞的眷屬來時，我們一定可以看到無數的新聞和悲喜劇。臺灣省農業試驗所　（本報資料室）　　臺北大橋夏京　（特派員江暮雲攝奇）　　臺灣淡水港口　（特派員江暮電寄）香港教育與僑校  十四日香港航訊　特約記者凌芳　　香港報紙的篇幅近半月來都給學校新聞佔去了大部份。現在氣候還是相當的酷熱，但港中一般中文學校，却紛紛準備秋季復課。跟着物價的上漲，各校學費也打算增加百分之五十至百分之百，甚至巧立名目，增加種種雜費一般家長頓覺負担過重，引起了輿論界的同情，報上對於責難學校當局的話便越來越多。原本是一個被壓在社會底層的問題，而今却翻了身，變成每個家庭談話的資料。　　（一）特殊人型　　對留心香港問題的人，香港的教育倒是一個很好的題目。英人方面，老早對這個啓迪民智的工具，下了一番工夫，經過香港英文學校培養出來的學生，尤其所謂「皇家書館」的畢業生，在香港社會裏自成一種特殊人型，他們的眼光看不見香港以外的事物，而專心致志於他們的職務，他們是一種實是求是盡忠竭力的工作人員，英國人靠了他們鞏固了在香港的統浩地位，而香港也就在他們維勤維謹的服務下，一步一步向前發展—在這一點上來說，英人對香港的敎育措施是相當成功的，反過來，我們的僑民敎育却遭慘痛的失敗了。　　英人在香港的敎育事業已根傑蒂固結實纍纍的時候，我們僑校的基本才開始發芽生葉。戰前立案的僑校，計有中學四十三所，小學十四所，職校四所，但太平洋戰爭如一陣狂風，把他們吹得七零八落，枝斷根翻。戰後，僑校相率復員，單是中學方面，已逾戰前的半數，但戰前粗具規模的校舍，現多已遭拆毁，圖書儀器，本來已感缺乏，現則蕩然無存。僑校工作，不啻從頭做起，人才物力，難關重重，不勝負荷。　　（二）掙扎復興　　英人辦敎育事業，也遭同等的破壞，抑且尤有過之，香港大學，皇仁書院，英皇書院等大建築物，戰後蕭然四壁，荒凉一片，（若干敎會設辦的學校，因遭日軍徵用，尙稱完整）但英人重入香港後，便依照其殖民地部原定的計劃，儘速利用未有破壞的校址恢復「官立」英文學校五所，以初年級生爲主。每校內分「上午校」和「下午校」上午校」由上午八時至下午一時，「下午校」由下午一時至六時。地盡其用，則一所學校可當作兩所。原有敎會學校，則收容高年級生，破除傳統，試行男女同校。香港敎育，當局領得鉅額復興費，凡戰前服務於「官立」學校的敎員，俱予羅致，作擴充的準備。敎員薪金比其他政府人員優厚，原有人才亦樂於復業。現在僑校正在焦頭爛額掙扎復興之中，港府的官立學校却已踏進康莊坦道，向前邁進。　　（三）進身之階　　在僑校沒有在港設立前，港中的中文學校僅有兩三所中學，其餘都是私立小學和地方社團或同鄉會設辦的義學。有些家長甚至不讓子弟進中文小學，便逕把他們送入英文學校去。英文學校沒有中小學之分，攻讀八年，便可進升大學。這八年恰等於我國學制中小學的十二年，倒節省了四年的光陰。如果不進大學，這八年的訓練，足够一般靑年去當港府初級文員或洋行書記。因此，英文學校可說是「洋塲業務」的「進身之階」。貧寒家庭的子弟，祗好進義學或學塾式的小學鬼混幾年，出作華人商店的店員或洋行的僕歐。　　然而，時代的齒輪慢慢的轉動，祖國的大地呼喚着被侷促在這塊殖民地裘的靑年。他們便掉下了笨重的西書，負笈回國求學。有此需要，中文中學逐絞在港中出現。我敎育當局也慢慢地開始注意在歧路徬徨中的僑生，港校爲了便利學生回國升學，盡量使兩地的課程取得銜接。進一步便向敎育部和僑委會立案。國內的師資人才也流進香港來。迨至廣州失陷，當地敎育人员大批遷港，僑校數目激增，這可說是僑校開辦的全盛時期。　　（四）使用〔鐵腕〕　　這裏所說的僑校，即指那些已向「僑委會，敎育部，廣東敎育　和香港敎育司立案」的中小學而言。僑校的設立儼如向本港殖民地敎育投下一顆炸彈，港中原有的中文學校亦不得不迎頭趕上，以求進步。學熟式的私立小學，無形中遭了淘汰。官立英文學校來了一個對手，港府對僑校開始注意，却還採取相當開明的態度，未有阻撓牠的發展。但英軍重入香港後，英國遠東殖民地政策經鍋邱吉爾內閣小組委員會的檢討，已有新的轉變。尤其對文化和敎育方面，加强了他們的警覺性，必要時，不惜使用「鐵腕」作干涉的行動。原有僑校的復員工作似尙未加倍留難，但新僑校之設，已沒有過去那麼容易。　　（五）加强控制　　港府現已根據新殖民地政策，以政治力作後盾，使用雄厚的財力，豐富的物力和地方上的便利企圖剷的了僑校的根基間接地加深他們對這殖民地的控制。他們的步驟可分兩方面略作說明，消極方面：（一）港敎育司以維持學生的健康爲名：戰前一個課室可收容學生五十人的，現在只准設卅五個座位，同時還要加裝水厠和門窗。戰後房租飛漲，一層房子月租百餘元，祗得座位卅餘個，平均每個座位，就要月租四五元。加上敎員薪金和其他開支，一個學生的擔負就要十元，學費那得不貴？學費太貴，學生委實負擔不起，學校也難支持下去。（二）學校立案和敎員註册的限制。香港敎育司把僑校的校長當作「司理」，英文名曰　Manager。辦學如開店，戰前頗爲容易，手續亦簡單。戰後新學校立案，倘符合上述衛生條件，只准招生試辦，立案證書多數却遲遲不發。證書一天不發，則學校一天還未取得合法地位，隨時有被勒令停課的可能。敎員註册，除非是戰前已註册的或港府師範畢業生，否則頗爲嚴格。國內檢定合格的師資，港方槪不承認。敎員註册不成，學校是不能聘用的。　　（六）壁壘分明　　積極方面：（一）港府加緊恢復原有的官立學校，協助各敎會英文學校復課，幷以「津貼金」補助港中開辦多年的私立中文小學，阻止牠們加入僑校的隊伍襄。香港各官立學校和敎會英文學校，都是自建相當規模的校舍。戰時遭了破壞的，港府已着手從新建築，軍隊徵用的，現已陸續發還。（香港大學亦準備於十月復課）。牠們不愁經費不足，祗愁學生人數缺少。因此正當僑校增加學費掙扎圖存的時候，官立學校或受港府補助的學校，仍收戰前規定的學費，—每月四元至五元，與僑校成强烈的對比。（二）港府計劃大量訓練師資幷獎勵學業的師範生在港辦學校。港府設立的師範學校，有官立漢文中學附屬師範和羅富國師資學院兩所。前者以中文爲主，後者則以英文。前者側重訓練小學師資，後者中學師資。各師範生求學時間，旣可享受免費及其他優待，畢業後又穩有出路，復校以來，座無虛席。在五年至十年內，港府勢將頒佈「非香港畢業的師範生不能在香港任敎」的法令，届時港府的敎育權便和我們的敎育權由磨擦而發生正面的衝突了。（三）港府對僑校的課程，也有相當的限制。四書經史古文和英語，同列爲中小學的必修科。小學方面，本港敎育司已編製一套「漢文讀本」，全用文言，强迫各學採用。各校祗得除「漢文讀本」外，再增一科國語。中學方面，本港敎育司規定採用民十三編訂商務版的「現代初中或高中敎科書」，新課程標準的敎本，似不受歡迎，國定課本，更不待說。僑校每個課室，除時間表外還須多掛一個「課程用書表」，那也許是港中敎育制度的一個特色！　　很明顯的，本港的敎育分作兩大壁壘，一邊是殖民地敎育，一邊是三民主義敎育，一邊以訓練忠於英皇的「香港人」爲目標，一邊是以啓發僑童思想培養良好國民爲目標，彼消此長，勢難兩立。因此，現在復員中力謀發展的僑校，便遭遇港府極大的阻力。僑校方面在僑委會指導下，已組成華僑敎育總會港九分會。行政院核定僑民敎育復員經費項內，港中僑校復員費將爲美金三十二萬元。（港府一九四六年度敎育經費預算達五百餘萬，估港中政費開支第五位）僑校方面現盼望政府能够立刻給予實際的援助！錢江北岸海塘缺口六處共一千七百公尺，均以柴塘搶修，圖為完成之柴塘內部正加填土方。　（盛澄世攝）飛向西安　十四日西安航訊  陳藩　　記者有西安之行，下決心之初，在七月十五左右，那時候中牟臨時大橋，因舊黃河不久即將泛濫，自行拆卸，徐州外圍正進行着拉鋸戰，平漢鐵路又逢李先念部到處破壞，恰巧中央航空公司上海西安綫開航，而且票價也賤，僅八萬二千元。但是短時期沒有飛機去西安。後來票價增加一百五十倍，但也沒有飛機。八月四日的淸晨，我纔托了某大員的福搭上了飛機，在悵惘中帶來歡欣。　　戰前上海西安的航空綫，上海起程，經南京·蚌埠·鄭州·至西安的直徑，現在改爲上海·經南京·巢湖·漢口·老河口·藍縣·西安。我們這次飛機起飛時間晏，南京沒有客貨，就不飛南京了，而我們也失去了在高空島瞰五古都之一，遍地是六朝遺跡，龍蟠虎踞，雄偉宏大的石頭城的眼福。飛機改向江浙交界（偏江蘇境）飛，掠過我國最富庶區，盛產米·棉·絲·魚的太湖東流域，（這地區由蘇州河·黃浦江·運河·勾成三角形）掠過由太陽反映下澄黃色粼粼的太湖，掠過天目山餘脈茅山脈的紅土帶，沒入靑弋江流域以後，土壤轉變了顏色，（飛機上發現很困難）地形又平坦了，這兒原來是我國四大米市的蕪湖呀！還有紙·茶·安徽人是富庶的，浙東一帶經濟情形，決不會比這兒更好。　　飛機越黃山邊緣行，在荻港西南碰見了長江，進入著名產茶地帶霍山支脈皖山（一稱潛山）了，山區的上午總多雲，這雲多而且厚，飛機在這兒最是動盪不定，大约入湖北境，飛機便徐徐地下去，和長江握手時，飛機已飛得很低很低的了。待武昌機塲下降時，繞一圈便降落了。武昌逗留好些時候，才繼續飛了，飛過了已經破殘了四大商埠之一的漢口，飛過了我國二大水災區之一的兩湖平原的最低地區，那天也正閙着水災，一片白茫茫，祇和漢水劃出了界綫，（漢水河床高，）飛過並不能稱山巒地帶的大洪山脈南緣，那兒低低的，高空中俯視下去，彷彿累累荒塚，沒有森林，祇是一羣羣的黃泥崗而已。崗上每多是大路，這些山脈是長江流域常有的，而尤以湘鄂鞭一帶最爲顯著。那三省除太湖區平原以外的平原，大多與江南平原有些迴異。便是河道較稀，湖泊也沒有，邨莊附近樹林很少。展眼望去，全是黑黝黝的田坵，這地區沒有似江南平原那樣富有生氣，但也沒有似黃淮平原的一副可憐相，當然更沒有如塞外平原一片荒凉。這地區正代表了整個中國農民靠自己的勞力與自然爭生存的一幅悲酸岡，當然愈向山脈邊緣溯行，這情形愈不如。中國自杭州灣向西北劃一直綫去看生活經濟，還不是每况愈下？武當山·大別山·終南山·秦嶺諸脈，多的是少年型的山峯，生產量旣有限，而又不時鬧土匪。最近李先念部一面協商，一面鬥爭，又到了這裏，弄得民不聊生。　　丹江的源頭在華山南麓，所以記者越過了華山，進入了已認爲貧脊的黃河流域，黃河中華民族的誕生地！渭水中華民族的搖籃！你蒼老了！然而記者以爲這地區還同埃及的尼羅河一樣有價値，他少了金字塔，人首獅身像，木乃伊，但他蘊有東方獨特的藝術（碑林），也有許多古代帝王的陵墓，所遺憾者缺乏歷史性的攷績而已。　　跳下了飛機，記者穿起漢唐時代的衣冠，也戴上中古時代的眼鏡，携綫裝書，和古代人留下的手蹟晤談了，可惜我不解佛經，否則我更可知道多些，我祗能找到精神的外型，不能解剖內蘊，眞叫人跥脚叫恨！　　有人說：「跑過國內外多少都市；祇有對北平留下深刻的印象，」但西安也有他的可愛處。不過眼睛要能神往古代，凝想未來，則這城市有精神。有規模，有計劃。有希望，祇要人力加工便成了。馬路柏油化，房子立體化，自來水自　橋來，古物搜集起來，那末西安人可以放棄今日的生活，那矮而小的屋宇窰洞，不潔帶苦的井水，彌天的黃沙！讀者意見規約　　（一）本欄絕對公開，文責自負。但切忌冗。（二）切勿攻計心人，切勿一稿兩投。（三）投稿人須寫明讀者意見稿件，並須舉示眞實姓名及地址，但發表時得用筆名。（四）本欄稿件槪不致酬。（五）對來稿本報有删節之權。（六）來稿披露與否，槪不函復。（七）本報於必要時，得將來稿轉致有關機關參考。　　營業稅接連而來　　編輯先生：我們是一家小文具店，往日的營業額低得很可憐，除開學期間比較熱閙外，都在平淡中過去。本年一月至三月的營業稅，我們呈報爲依營業額千分之十五計算，共約萬餘元，不想直接稅局通知單來，須繳納四萬五千元，好容易付了；不料夏季也就接續而來，（四月—六月）一變而爲六萬元！試問我們怎樣繳付呢？每日所售不到二萬元，即使依標準算，那中間的差額究有多少？稅局方面是否依標準來計算的？而且我們的營業都是有賬，大可以淸査一下，有沒有舞弊，如其少塡了呈報的數目，請直接稅局特別査核，否則應據實徵收，是不是？（景星號）　　再論房屋租賃法　　編者先生：茲讀本月六日徐幹翰君所談的租賃特別法今敝人有意見數則如下（一）房客因房租低廉，且抑有特別法保護，故東亦租上一屋，西亦租上一屋，就上海言，未知能有幾人如此？（二）目前戰事雖已結束，但屋荒確較勝利前嚴重，今省政府發表租賃特別法，於實際情形上甚爲需要。（三）政府能顧全多數民衆的福利，而犧牲少數者權益，當然是合理的措置。（李志偉）　　萬餘人無水供應　　編者先生：江蘇路東諸安浜底梅家橋弄，居戶數達千餘，均是貧民，分居平房約千間，但並無自來水裝備，不得不向附近挑取或購熟水。因戶口衆多，求供自較困難，時値暑夏，備感痛苦。事實上有萬人以上之集居地點，應有飮水的供應裝置，蓋有關市民健康者匪鮮也。故懇當局顧念及此，迅即在本處至少裝設一自來水太平龍頭，則萬餘貧民飲水，不致時虞斷絕，感恩匪淺矣。（梅家橋弄趙永年等）　　叫我遷到那裏去　　編輯先生：鄙人居於康定路三德坊廿五號內，迄今二房東忽拒收七八月份租金，藉口本房屋前係其姊所有，日內返滬，屢逼令無條件遷讓。査本市房屋非金條不可，鄙人係一薪水階級，月入甚微，遷到那裏去？惟有請房屋租賃管理委員會及社會各界救濟了！（鄭福元）</p>

<p>淮上行　本報十七日臨淮關快訊　特派員邵慎之〔自古保江必先固淮〕  葉適　　自自然以至社會，現在的淮一點也不見其固。到處浸水，災象嚴重。公路交通斷絕，至少有五百萬民衆浸在水裏，動彈不得。淮河本身的水本來不會成災，可是加進黃河的水，這才弄得像民國二十年的模樣。　　花園口堵口不完工，七月廿二日轟的一聲，衝敞缺口，黃河之水賈魯來，經過穎川，奔入淮河，據黃河工程局測量是流量每秒八千立方公尺，淮河的最高流量是一萬五，本身的流量今年接近七千，恰恰凑成足數，復原至民國廿年的紀錄。然而十五年來，河床已頗有淤積，流速加高，水位創新紀錄了。　　民國廿年淮河最高水位二〇·一七公尺，這是淮河本身的水，如果今年也如此，再加黃水，則　沈可必，災情就不堪設想了。　　滔天的洪水　　記者啣命作淮上行，舉目四顧，到處洪水滔天，波瀾宏闊，再開槍砲聲，憶吟杜甫「血染川原丹」之句，痛苦塡膺，不能自抑。白茫茫的一片，流閃着赭黃色，露出幾堆屋脊，幾業高梁，或者稀稀落落的大豆葉，被波浪搖　，綠色偃仰，似有所語，這就是隨處可見的風景。　　皖省府有一個搶淮堤的工程組織，而取名爲「防黃處」，有幽默性。導淮委員會自四川復員，直接對淮河第一件工作是復堤，成立「復堤工程局」，要修復一千零八十公里長的淮堤，要堆上一千四百多萬土方，要把堤身增高至洪水位上一公尺；預備至本年底完工。向行總請准麵二萬七千噸，以工代賑，可是自五月迄今，已經用去三千多噸，爲了配合防黃處救急，修補潰決，恐怕完成計劃時，二萬七千噸粉還不够，未修先潰，弄得措手不及。　　昨天早上大雨滂沱，我在蚌埠看到殷誠之局長，他看看天色，愁雲如墨，說道：「這塲雨下來，水位要破紀錄了。今天是二〇·一五公尺。」到了晚上，果然昇到二〇·一八。他說：「如果沒有黃水：淮河水位至少要低兩公尺，決無問題。」　　防黃處是用徵工辦法，同復堤局一樣，忙得不可開交。我在此區工作，暗忖這種規模的災情至今還被漠視，甚至無聞，那無疑是談和打的消息壓倒了它！　　沈默的災區　　有災情之後，第二題目自是賑濟，這樣的文章和題目在中國老是做不完。可是這次的大規模水災還遲遲未引起各方注意。悲劇的結尾終會是悲劇，水災區交通阻塞，幾百萬民衆浸在水裏，幾乎悄然無聲，他們保特沈默，好像已和外界隔絕，皖省的黨政復員督導團，現在有成爲災情調査團之勢：但一時還不能收集數字資料。這是政治機構的麻痺，還是現實投來了諷刺呢？　　國民黨皖省主委劉眞如爲了這件事到南京去向政院·社會部·中央黨部·行總呼籲，安徽的地方報紙上關切地登載着他的消息，說「已經引起各方人士對皖東北災情之重視，前途頗為樂觀云。」　　因爲淮河的水位一高，支流的水就不能宣洩，於是漫將開來。截至目前爲止，災象已萬分嚴重，一點沒有樂觀的跡象。皖東北受災最重的有頴上·阜陽·太和·臨泉·鳳臺·懷遠·宿縣·靈壁·定遠·嘉山·盱眙·天長·來安·五河·泗縣·鳳陽·蒙城·渦陽，災區面積估計不下五萬方公哩！　　皖省政府·黨部及參議會聯合辦的事有三件：一，回救濟分署請工賑急賑；二，請政院豁免田賦；三，請將復員經費自一億元增至十億元。　　諸位一定知道上列各縣中，除開水災之外還有遭兵災的，不特此也，若干縣本年還有蝗災。要辦超級復員工作。關於收成，問過熟悉安徽的人，說一二成總歸有的，「各縣多少有些山地。」這是理由。　　五河共軍退却時，不知怎樣，澮河的堤忽然潰決了，就有那麼巧。現在五河縣泡在水裏，公路不通。流亡縣政府設在臨淮關張家大樓，國軍雖已進入，縣長張憲還遲遲不去，有些逃難出來先生們因爲回去過早，到晚上不知怎樣會被人殺掉，於是安全問題大被考慮，一個空頭縣長自然也有其考慮處，可是五河老百姓竟趕到臨淮關來，在張家大樓周圍大貼標語，推人請謁，恭迎縣長同縣，就在十四日這天，才開一條船到五河去「復員」的。　　夏威的參謀長徐啓明中將就勸我不必到五河去，「等半月二十天再說吧」。　　臨淮關決堤形勢略圖　（本報資料室特繪）　　泗縣的戰役　　古人以淮泗並論，謂「欲規中原者，必得淮泗」。實則即指兩淮而言。皖東五縣，現已全人國軍掌握，蘇北則尙存十一縣在共軍之手。「保江必先固淮」，蘇北戰事，實係淮甸之爭。威脅京　之語罪通普，宣傳詞令可比。如淮泗動，則中原勢危，大局爲變。影響所及，非可等閒。　　目前皖東地區，多浸在水裏，此區國軍大率爲八桂子弟，跋涉澤鄕，迤水東進。記者曾逡巡於五河道上，共軍正以三萬之衆，於七日晚開始猛攻泗縣，勢猝而猛，十日戰事結束，共軍退去。我折返蚌埠時，途遇夏威將軍參謀長徐啓明中將。遂得悉泗縣之戰經過。　　共軍進攻泗縣的兵力中間，有八路軍第八師三個團，第七師三個團，都是新從魯南越隴海東段調來的。還有新四軍第二師四個團，第七軍分區三個獨立團，第九縱隊全部。此外有郝逆鵬舉淮海部隊不折不扣的僞軍萬餘人，總兵力有三萬。　　使用這樣龐大的兵力攻一小城，足見是一個大戰鬥。這裏特別要說一說郝鵬舉，共軍不是一向極力反對政府收編僞軍的嗎？現在爲什麽聯合了僞軍攻泗縣呢？還是僞軍聯合了共軍來攻泗縣呢？這些問題在熟悉方面獲得了答覆：　　（一）確爲共軍收（編）了郝逆鵬舉，並加以指揮，此次參加攻泗縣僞軍，僞郝逆偽軍的一部份。（二）日本投降之初，蔣委員長曾命令僞軍就原駐各地維持地方秩序，聽候命令，郝逆時任僞淮海省長，即搖身一變，自稱爲國軍，在徐州大辦「接收」。席捲所有，當國軍卅二集團軍挺進徐州時，徐州已成一空城，當局指定郝逆部隊暫駐津浦綫的曹村一帶，聽令改編。共軍則以武力的或政治的方式勸郝逆「繳械」，本年三月，政府下令全國軍隊縮編，於是郝逆就向共軍連人帶槍，繳械過去，無須縮編了。　　守泗縣國軍僅六個營，不足兩個團，三萬共軍猛撲而來，八月七日晚一舉而被突入，在大小北門毀壞的城牆缺口處，突入共軍，有兩個團的番號，泗縣已築成了獨立據點式的工事，激戰一夜，到天亮時就將突入共軍殲滅了。八日晚又攻東南門，又擊退，九日拂曉攻擊，又被攻入大北門，發生巷戰，爭奪居屋，一直打到晚上，又被逐出，十日晨共軍總退却。　　據發表泗縣城北門內及城郊遺屍達三千具，綜計其傷亡將達萬人。國軍則傷亡官佐共計三十五人，士兵九百五十一人。　　「積屍草木腥」，泗縣是保住了，但也毁滅了。仰望愁雲，遠弔英魂，此處即是戰爭！　　臨淮關風雨　　坐津浦車入淮南平原，就逐漸可以看到携槍牧牛的風景。秋風起處，烏雲萬丈，洶湧而過，雨珠猛擊車窗。坐快車北上的人少極了，車中異常悽寂。瞻望四野，彷彿置身大澤鄕中。而以臨淮關爲甚。　　隴海海西綫一斷，津浦營業收入更加慘淡，一個副站長不過拿十幾萬元，僅可買兩担米。總局在濟南，膠濟在搶修，兩處根本無收入，還須自浦徐和津德段拿錢用。月月入不敷出。浦徐段在去年十月和十二月遭遇共軍兩次破壞攻勢，路方工程師拚命搶修，救急通車，多處橋樑垂危未解，泛水届近，本擬計劃自三月至五月間全部修竣橋樑，使成永久式，不致受泛水影饗。照理浦鎭車廠的生產能力在一月內可製成預定的全部樑材鉚釘而有餘，但徐州以北也要搶修，須供應魚尾板·螺絲·道釘等材料，因此迎泛計劃破產，擬修的橋樑截至目前爲止，僅完成三分之一。——託天之福（工程師們看來如此），總算那些垂危的橋樑在小心護侍之下，還沒有出過險。行車近橋時，路旁就有一塊大紅漆脾，上有「停車再開」四個白字，白字已經剝落，那塊牌子却依然通紅，司機也依然停車再開，把車輛慢慢地，似乎是偸偸摸摸的開過去。眞要有十分仔細的忍耐性。　　三冲溝紀事　　臨淮關是屬於鳳陽縣的，縣府一在鳳陽，可是警察局則設在臨淮，此中消息，不難窺測。半月以前，臨淮關的北岸還在共軍勢力圈內，韓家台，郭府窰，南新莊，曹府牆，黃坂子，共軍這些村落裏進出，番號是第七軍分區的一個獨立團。他們在三冲溝兩岸堤上挖掘散兵坑，溝北岸共軍據有一個砲壘，爲了掃淸射界起見，把南岸的堤挖平兩百公尺，（見附岡）河北鎭民雖略有防衛，但並不如臨大敵，去挖工事，圖中所示，不過說明在這一地帶的關係，河北鎭老百姓說：「一旦共軍眞要進河北鎭，也只好讓他進來。」他們在這一帶放哨。　　當淮河水漲的時候，郭府窰一帶老百姓急得雙脚跳，他們眼睜睜的看河南岸在修堤，三冲溝却開了二百公尺的門，郭府保的保長郭鶴仙說：「我們去接頭了，他們答應我們去修，可是只准每天去二十個人，而且限定是郭府保的。結果我們沒有修。」　　導淮會的工程師說：「這裏有二千多方土，二百個人做，要十天才能完工。」這是科學的算法，這說明用廿個人去搶堤是等於零。　　本月初共軍退去，因爲水已經來了。就軍事觀點看，水已把三冲溝的重要性改變了，已沒有再扼守住這個砲壘的必要。自三冲溝以至河北鎭的一道堤，導淮會最近才去勘測，着手修復，可是洪水橫決，十五日又潰破一處，臨淮關對岸一個三角地帶，現在是汪洋一片。共軍在此曾經掘堤二百公尺，對於當地老百姓是沒有利益的。這是鐵的事實。郭府保的老百姓都是證人。　　南岸復堤工程如果也像三冲溝一樣不能進行，也不能搶修，那麼臨淮關的水勢一定更加不堪設想的。五河方面連一個工程師也還沒有去。我和工程師們吿別。我們彼此相看皮膚和臉色，都是那麼黑，我們在泥濘中互道珍重，互祝健康和安全。　　快到臨淮關，車子慢慢地趟過一條水快碰外鋼樑的架樑橋，然後入站。這時臨淮關街市已展露在目前，幾乎臨淮關整個鎭市都已沒在水英，泥潭塞途。這還是搶修過堤後的現象，否則還要嚴重。走進街道，水深沒膝，但還可以坐黃包車，如果再漲水，那麼除單恃陸地行舟外，便別無其他辦法。正街地勢較高，尙且如此，鎮的邊沿許多房屋則大都已塌沒在水裏，有些還露出一個屋脊，使人憑弔。如果洪水將一切冲沒得連影跡全無，那麽災字的意義也失掉了。現在那些被災的居民却擠到正街上來，或者在堤頂或空地上搆搭簡陋的棚屋，拖泥帶水，　氣冲天，哭喊聲絞成一團。久處在這裏的也許不覺情况的混亂，我初臨其境，不免驚駭。人們　然株守着這塊被洪水蹂躪的土地，他們在等待着什麽呢？而五　等地的老百姓還躱在這裏，不　回鄉。　　他們奔走相吿，說述永勢漲落的消息。市街上店舖的門大多洞開，空無一物，只有腥味刺鼻的濁水在其中洄旋。這些店舖大抵已經遷移，但有不少小店舖却仍然堅守在那裏，照常營業，他們把一切東西都高高擱起，他們的臥床下面就是水，一躺下來，背部離開水面不過一尺；這樣侷處其間，以待顧客。　　我在泥濘中找到了導淮委員會的幾位工程師，他們櫛風沐雨，同水奮鬥，工作辛苦極了。他們在抗戰中測量沙江，修綦江水角，興川滇黔三雀水利，復員回來，立刻碰到淮水泛濫。我們在風雨中走過漫水的街道，一同巡視新修的堤岸。在臨淮關南端，他們已趕修了五公里長堤岸一條，以工代賑，用土三十萬方。這條堤堆的不是土，而是麵粉！每方土二斤粉如取土困難或路遠的，則每方三斤或四斤。兩千人作工，兩個月究成。許多船舶因開不出去，都擠在臨淮關，尤其新橋灣裏，沿着五公里長的堤岸，檣桅如林，熱鬧透了。　　水什麼時候可退呢？全沒準兒，臨淮關浸在水裏已一個月了。我看見手提鹽水瓶橡皮管的醫生，身穿短打亦涉水去看病。—可怕的疫癘！（各岡片均係特派員邵愼之所攝。）　　（上）三冲溝共軍挖平堤岸百呎（下）船家難民　　臨淮關居民於水中搶運傢具東行七星期  徐節俊　　不久以前，余因出席遠東國際法庭審判日本戰犯作證，飛赴東京，滯留至七星期之久，始得遄返上海，以此機會，得目覩東京等處戰後遺跡與一般平民戰後生活之實况，拉雜記錄，用告國人使知戰敗國目下眞相之一斑，或亦有足資警惕者在焉。　　戰後東京，非復當年景象，建築物之被毀者達十分之七八，橫濱·大坂·神戶等處尤甚，大小工廠，蕩然無存。惟餘破壞之烟囱，如蘆芽之矗立。繁盛區域，夷爲平地。頽垣敗壁，滿目荒凉。其他城市，除西京、奈良外，均遭波及。西京爲日本勝蹟”奈良爲文化區域，故盟軍於轟炸時網開一面，保留此魯殿靈光。即東京區內學府所在，亦尙多完好。皇城附近，僅呈小創，聊示薄懲，留其反省餘地。市內祇銀座·神田·淺草·　谷等區尙形熱鬧。其他則人烟寥落，市塵蕭條。東京市民於被燬荒塲多利用空地，栽種蔬菜，由市區一變而爲農圃，誠不勝滄桑之感。　　東京人口本有七百餘萬，今所留者僅及半數。市內汽車馳騁驟多，大　爲來自美邦之摩托。自皇宮以逮各省部，寂寂無聲，門可羅省，夙號世界第五大都市者，今除空　街道尚留象徵外，較大建築，破壞無遺。惟宏偉瑰麗之明治神宮，巍然矗立，完整無恙。宮內兩壁，嵌有縱橫丈餘之名畫八十幅，描寫明治一生事業，自出生以至入葬，經歷維新時代各項政績之表現，畫筆生動，畫法亦隨時代而演進。前半部倣我國之渲染，後半部效西洋之油彩，極姸盡態，惟妙惟肖。尤令人觸目者爲甲午之役，與俄日之戰，當日揚威國外之情態，活現紙上，而馬關春帆樓一幕，李鴻章與伊藤博文分庭抗禮，情景逼眞。由今觀之，徒成歷史陳跡，倘與今日戰犯當庭審判之影片相對照，當不知作何感想，好戰必敗，足爲鑒戒。　　日本人民現在生活之狀况，當爲國人所欲知。衣著一項，日人視爲不甚重要。住屋雖多被炸，但一般即就被燬荒塲中架築小屋，以避風雨。最嚴重者，厥爲食之問題。日本糧食，本極缺乏，敏前多賴越南·遏羅·台灣等處接濟。戰車期中，憑藉軍力，自佔領地任意攫取。我國糧食每年被其載運返國者，不知幾何石，今則此項來源，完全斷絕。民食恐慌，自在意中。現每口每日配給食米僅二合一勺，尙不足當健飯者之一餐。而日政府尙恐難以爲繼。閣議討論，報紙呼聲，以　　深刻爲主題。不但糧食如此，即油鹽肉類蔬菜，以至日用品如紙烟·火柴·肥皂·毛巾等等，亦皆有定量配給，市塲上幾於無處購買。偶有黑市，價格高昻。菜館除華僑開設之「中華料理」數家外，多爲小飲食店。商店所陳列者皆屬人造絲綢，手工用具，兒意玩物，書籍課本之類。應用物品幾仝鳳毛麟角。盟軍在此一切主副食物及日片品，均係自行運輸而至。惟日本通貨，尙未高度膨漲，普通物價指數較之戰前，最高不超出百倍。配給物品，皆係平價，不過十倍。據云普通每人月得三百元即足生活。故物資雖感困難，而社會狀態，尚見安定。行的一項，更不成問題。日人於交通事業，辦理甚善，火車按班開行，鐘點非常準確。電車縱橫街市，電車不及之處，則以公共汽車代之。馬路多爲寬闊之柏油路。亦有以小石砌成者，皆整齊平坦。地下隧道縱橫，皆通電車，且設商肆，自成街市。附郊各縣，則有高架電車，以資貫通。此外自由車甚多，惟我人所謂東洋車者則幾於絕跡，僅於銀座熱鬧區中，所存不足數十輛，為來自西方盟軍之裝飾品。此足徵其節省人力處。電車雖亦擁擠，但秩序頗好。上車不必買累，下車時每人補票，絕無脫漏。其他公共事業如電話，深入鄉村，衛生設備，雖受破壞，人民頗能自行整潔，以補不足。社会服务本報與救濟醫院　聯合主辦沙眼防治運動　　本市大中學生及敎職員一律免費治療　　本報社會服務處及救濟醫院董事長饒家駒神父院長王爵榮醫師最近爲本市各學校學生沙眼蔓延，幾佔全數百分之六十以上，若不早爲防治，必致影響健康，爲害匪淺，決定聯合舉辦「沙眼防治運動」，第一届暫以中學生及敎職員爲限，先行診治一百五十名，診費藥費全免，俟第一届治愈後，仍當繼續辦理，以盡國民一份子之天職。同時希望因敝報院等之提倡，全市曁全國各大醫院，羣起響應，防治沙眼，使舉國病胞，永睹光明，國家社會，實深利賴。附錄簡則如下：　　申報館社會報務處救濟醫院社會服務處　合辦「防治沙眼運動」簡則　　（一）資格　凡本市大中學生或敎職員，患有沙眼者，均可聲請治療。　　（二）貧用治療暫定一個月至兩個月，費用全免。　　（三）醫師由救濟醫院特請眼科專家（前廣慈醫院眼科專門醫師）孫元明，張義勇兩醫學博士担任治療。　　（四）登記八月二十五日起，上項學生及教職員患有沙眼者，先向本報社會服務處塡具申請表，持往西藏南路五四七號救濟醫院候診。答復讀者　法律質疑　　（一）押解質疑　　蔡炳甫問　（一）興化縣巨　况明愷綁架搶刧，婦孺皆知，後竟公開投敵，充僞團長五年，危害地方十餘年，自認不諱。在職軍官，是否有權將其拘捕？（二）匪犯在押解時，因圖逃而遭格斃，主管人員，是否犯法？（三）押送匪犯至總庫而未解綏靖司令部，是否何罪？（五）閱報載懲治漢奸條例，凡充僞軍官在少校以上者，分別輕重治罪，况犯是否適用此條例？（六）預審筆錄，經當塲宣讀，由况犯承認後印有指模，能否生效？（七）被吿范澄，爲本縣除大害，民衆竭誠感戴，茲爲良心驅使，擬從事營救，應如何進行？　　〔傅况鱗律師答〕（一）果如來函所述，該匪罪跡昭彰，逮捕送懲，幷無不合。（二）匪犯脫逃，追捕不及，開槍擊斃，依法主管官應負行政處分之責任，實施開槍射擊之押解兵，應負過失殺人之責任。（三）以軍事系統言，自以解送直接上級機關之總庫爲是，（四）依刑法第三百零二條第一項，私行拘禁論，但因不得已之故障，而致逾限時，經査明屬實者，可以免議。（五）該犯旣曾充僞軍團長，係上校階級，自在懲治漢奸條例懲治之列，（六）當然有效。（七）可由地方公正紳耆，聯名貝文承辦機關，詳舉事實，證明被吿爲地方除害，情有可原，以爲承辦機關之參考。　　（二）惡意遺棄　　于文靜問　我是一個懦弱的女子，我的丈夫，是一個地痞·賭棍·烟鬼·卅一年夏，敵寇侵擾家鄕，他就趁此機會，以種種犯罪？（四）解犯過廿四小時，應治欺凌與苛虐的手段，迫我離家，否則，就要將我打死，我不得已而被迫歸居母家，而遭受遺棄，後雖經多方托人向其理論，他總是一味蠻言，未獲具體解決，他旣不許我歸家也不負擔我生活費用，又不和我離婚，迄今五年，我依然過着流浪苦悶的生活，請問（一）這樣是否算遺棄？用何種手續訴諸法律？（二）依此情形，可否由我單方面登報離婚？在法律上有無效力？（三）離婚後，子女的敎讀婚配責任誰屬？不輕離婚手續，而再嫁別人，是否合法？（四）如我實行與人同居，被我原夫控吿時，我和同居的對方，是否會受法律的制裁？　　〔傅况鱗律師答〕（一）已屬毫無疑義的惡意遺棄，在刑法上爲犯罪。（二）惡意造桀，如仍在繼續狀態中，可向法院請求離婚，但由一方登報離婚，於法無據。（三）離婚後子女敎養婚嫁之事，依法由夫任之，但另有約定者，從其約定。（四）須經離婚手續。（五）未經離婚前，夫妻關係，依然存在，若與人同居，即犯刑法第二百卅九條之罪，處一年以下有期徒刑，其相姦者亦同。</p>

<p>衛生与医药心理衛生的意義及重要  夏鎮夷　　　當霍亂流行的時季，衛生當局總有廣大的防疫宣傳，使民衆深知霍亂的危險與預防的重要，每年也有一度的防癆運動，使人們都能明瞭肺癆對民族健康的爲害與撲滅的迫切，我嘗翻閱一般學校的衛生敎材中對於霍亂與肺癆都佔重要的地位，而我們却忽略了一個爲　民族健康更甚的勁敵——精神病。我們知道整個的人是包含着兩方面的：身體和心理，身體要注重衛生，心班也要注重衛生，我們對身體健康　　注意，對於心理健康更不可忽視。賴魯氏（La　Rue）說：「沒有心理的健康，只有身體的健康，不算是真健康。」　　兩種含義　　在這個世界動　的今日，人們的一切失去了保障，生活在高度的繁張中，精神病人的日增與問題的嚴重是無可諱言的。每年因精神病而間接直接的損失，實是可怕，在我國精神病人雖無正確的統計，若與其他各國統計來比較一下，則不難推測數目與損失的驚人，姑以美國爲例，一九二〇年美國醫學會的報吿：全國人口每三百二十五人中，有一人生精神病，又據紐約的調查：全州每二十二人中有一人精神失常，全美國精神病院的患者共四十三萬〇八百人，每年增加二萬人，一九二六年的統計：美國每年費於精神病院的經費共九千萬金元，單就紐約一州患者薪金的損失達一萬四千三百萬金元，精神道德上的損失，更足令人驚心，即全美每一百二十五對夫婦中必有一對因精神病而離婚，全國每年犯罪數共五十萬，自殺的一萬五千，其中約有半數係精神病所致，至一九三六年美國百分之一的人口有精神病症狀，精神病人增至一百三十萬人，佔全國醫院病床百分之四十七，每年精神病院的維持費須三千〇八十六萬五千金元，最近杜魯門總統在國會中發表稱：「美國至少有二百萬人患精神病，至少有一千萬人在他們一生中有一個時期需要在醫院中治療精神病。」假如我們將上述種種損失無論是道德的，經濟的，秩序的，事業的，綜合起來，便可看到精神病已成爲如何可慮的嚴重問題，我們要解決這個問題與避免種種不可估計的損失，則心理衛生運動的提倡與推進，實是刻不容緩的事。　　我知道大部份的國人對心理衛生沒有深切的認識，更有對心理衛生不知道究竟是什麽一回事，心理衛生是以科學的方法，藝術的手腕，使個人心理得到健全而自然的發展，以養成健全的人格，他的含義有二：消極方面是防制精神病的產生，改良精神病者的待遇；積極方面是促進精神的健康，養成完整的人格。　　錯誤觀念　　關於精神病預防的種種，將有另文專述，致於矯正對於精神病者的態度與觀念，也是今後推行心理衛生工作要務之一，社會上有不少的人對精神病者始終不能如身體其他疾病一般的受到人們的同情，社會上對待精神病人的態度，仍不免冷酷，誠認，和歧視，他們仍迷信精神病人係魔鬼附身或天神示罰，於是加以監禁，虐待和作　　　邪歡解的迷信苟當，不但經濟上無形的損失，而且躭誤了治愈的希望，進有不少人視精神病是一麵恥辱，所以當秘而不宣或不敷出而求治，這種錯誤觀念與態度實是推行心理衛生工作的　　。　　生活藝術　　心理衛生最高的目的，不單是精神病的治療與預防，而是增加個人適應的能力與養成究整的人格，我們知道人生最迫切的要求，在求個人的本能與環境的需要存着一種調和而完滿的關係。人人有了健全的心理，才能自由還用他天賦的智慧來應付複雜變化的環境，心理衛生也就是以促進這種最高理想的實現爲駡的。心理學桃威花脫氏。（ＷilliamWhite）說：「心理衛生是生活的藝術」實含有深遠的意思。　　由此看來，心理衛生不單是一個單純的醫學衛生問題，也是，社會與敎育問題，我深望社會人士對此應有深切的認識，更希望醫生，敎員，父母，社會工作者，宗敎家以及廣大的羣衆聯合起來推進這心理衛生神聖的工作。白米的改良  祺譯　　威林博十最早提倡食糙米以防腳氣病。一九一〇年他在馬尼刺先採用食糙米之法，以除去菲律賓地方哨兵的脚氣病。此法實行後，翌年即大見功效。在遠東行之於其他政府機關，如軍營，監獄，學校等均甚奏效。凡在可以强迫使守紀律規程的機關，皆可使食糧米以防治脚氣病。祇需保存米粒的適量糯曆與胚，而使人民可得新近去殻之米即可。若去榖殻太久，則帶糠與胚之糙米，容易變味。菲律賓兵所食糙米，係每月新去榖殻者。　　雖然，普通人民之情形則不同，良以普通人民不願食糙米，而又不能强之使食，菲律賓，日本及其他政府，雖通過法律以獎食糙米，亦未當取效。大戰前，菲律賓與日本的統計工作，頗稱精密。據云：在戰前許多年數，因患脚氣病而死者，每年不减。一九二七年，日人死於腳氣病者一三九〇九人，在一九三七年日人死於斯病者尙有一一〇九七人。在菲律賓則患脚氣病而死者一九二七年爲一七〇七五人，一九三七年爲一六七九七人。在十年之間，脚氣病之死亡率，旋降旋昇，但並無確向降低之趨勢。從一九一〇年以後，每次遠東熱帶病學會大會，屢屢提倡糙米之益。惜高論宏文，僅讚美糙米而迄未能防止腳氣病。蓋事欲致果，必須實行也。　　今吾人已能製二種白米，各能預防脚氣病。第一種白米爲猛蒸榖米，此爲數百萬印度人所習知。其製法：將帶殼之榖，浸於熱水，使維生素從糠層滲透入米粒而分佈於米粒之內；然後使之乾燥，再去糠成白米。若處置得法，則全榖百分之七十的維生素，能保留在蒸敷之內。蒸榖法雖未免簡陋，但印人食米，三分之二是經過蒸製，（譯者按：在中國數千年來，江浙有數縣人民亦食蒸毅米，其蒸製法異於印度製法。又中國蒸榖米之維生素含量，亦稍多於印度蒸榖米。詳楊氏文。）　　第二種爲普通白米再設法使加入米中的維生素，不因淘洗而失去，是謂增料米。普通白米二百分中加此「增料」米一分，已能預防脚氣病。依此計算，所費比印度蒸榖米稍廉。（譯者按：此似指用機器工業面計算，若中國舊法蒸榖米，則幾乎與普通白米同價）他種水溶性維生素及礦物質亦可設法加入米內，同時，吾人當兼顧一切代價。大抵患脚氣病者。以窮人爲多，故須注意平民之購買力。　　美國採用維生素及礦物質以矯正白麵包白粉麵之缺點，此類工作在近五年來大有進步。去年美國百分之八十的白麵包白麵粉，感受此矯正處理，而所費頗徽。以每人每年計，僅多費一角八分。此數又可在稍減其包裝等費中抵償。此爲預防缺少羅生素病症的廉法，在美國因國立硏究院　麵粉廠麵包簡等合作成功！威博士則爲實行此工作的委員會主席。美國人用米極少，故其研究院未進行白米之改良。但碾米廠商知由米之缺點，故自動採取步驟以製「增料」米或蒸榖米。聯邦中之產米者，已在建置此類麽器矣。　　美國關醫　　華社敦　威博士來滬，改良中國米以除脚氣病。擬由衛生客糧食部滬市政府之協助，設立實騐室以檢騐米的成份與其譬養性質。且　騐糙米及烝榖米之營養價値與是否合乎衛生。將先設小廠製「增料」米以試其預防脚氣病之實效。「增料」米的味與外觀。類似普通米，而營養方面則邊過之，而所加費用又無多，此其優點。任何米均可製爲「增料」米，但尤注意於廉價米云。按中國蒸榖米，昔亦常用廉價米製成，故價廉物美。其詳將在中華醫學雜誌叙述，以供參考。　　〔威林博士所主張推廣之二類改良米，將使人民大受裨益。中國舊法烝榖米若同時推廣，則他的主張與成功的可能性，將　廣大而普及。譯者謹誌。〕輪血療法之沿革  易見龍　　血有醫療之功用不自今日始，十五世紀之時，羅馬敎皇多病，即取男　之血而醫之，以求却病延年。自茲以後，終十六世之時，輸血之風即盛行於　國，甚至有用羊血以療熱病及瘋病者。但因輸血之設備不全，血型不明，止血凝結無方，消　之法不善，且醫界對於血液之生理學仍是一知半解，致捐血者與受血者多受意外之傷害。於是巴黎議會決議取締，敎皇亦嚴令禁止，提倡輸血者即大嚐鐵窗風味，致輸血療法潭沒無關者歷百年之久。自十八世紀以至十九世紀之初，蒲氏（Blunall）發明三道注射器，可以直接迅速輸血。維氏及俾氏（Vinclilw　and　Bischoff）等實行用除去織維之法咸加入　　酸鈉以止血於體外凝結，藍氏（Landsteiner）及德氏（Decostello）等又先後分血型爲四類，血型不相投者則不能輸血，如是輸血療法始進入復興時期。　　第一次大戰時，前方救護人員對於因重傷或流血過多而引起之昏迷狀能常感棘手，此種病態即警界所謂休克。患休克者不論其流血與否，其血液中之水份，無基鹽類與蛋白質往往繼續由毛細血管之內滲透至週圍組織之內，形成循環血量之减少及血液循環之迂緩病態，如不迅速施以輸血治療，則患者在九至十二小時之內，多半死亡。在前綫戰事緊張之時，每個作戰人員皆有重要之任務，如欲臨時招致捐血之人，甄別血型或作血型配合，測騐之後，再爲輸血，於救急一途，殊感不便。於是在　戰末年英醫Traus及美醫Turner等即提倡　血以救傷，並主張用檸檬酸鈉及葡萄糖之混合劑以保存血液，惟大戰旋告終，輪血救傷已無急迫之需要，故其理想未能實現。迨至一九二八年俄　Yadin自中患急病死亡之屍體內抽出血液，加入止凝劑而冷藏之，然後甄別血型及作血淸檢査，先試用於動物再施於病人，結果證明冷藏至二星期久之血液，仍有起死回生之效，於是成立血庫以應急救之需，乃開血庫之先聲。　　血液中如有血球之存在，雖用冷藏法亦不能保存至二星期以上之久。第一次大戰之末期，英醫瓦氏（Ward）即欲去血球而用血漿。正式對於血漿作有系統之硏究者，當首推美國之病理學家施匡迷氏（Strumia）施氏反覆證明血漿可用冰凍及乾涸之法長期保存，又無血型不相投之害，隨時隨地可以注射。第二次大戰各國多用大批之乾血漿以救傷，致使陣地之死亡率由百分之五十降低至百分之二。今日血槳之用途已不限於戰地之救傷，月屬大傷性，手術性及創傷性之休克各種流血病，血蛋白缺乏症以及營養不良及抵抗力薄弱之病者皆可助以血漿之治療。花柳病與娼妓  董寶機　　誰都知道娟妓是傳染花柳病的媒介，但是偏偏良家女子繼續投身娼妓，而偏偏年靑蕩子喜歡尋花問柳，這究竟是殺人呢還是自死呢？　　我現在將上海市衛生局性病防治所娼妓檢騐的報吿介紹給各位：　　該所自二月中至五月底止檢騐新舊妓女二千人左右，其中檢騐完畢者一九二八人中一一二三人有花柳病（即以下各病）佔全數百分之六十五，其中頭等妓女病率略底，其下賤者病率佔百分之八十五左右平均梅毒百分之六一·二；淋病百分之一二·七；軟疳百分之〇·一；橫痰百分之〇·〇六；夫頭濕疣百分之〇·六。淋病軟疳及橫　病率較實際爲低，因此種患者病狀顯見，大多在受檢前治療，同時女子生殖器官組織特殊，淋菌常生存深處，不易檢出，又據報吿妓女中有慢性子宮頸尖者佔百分之六〇，此項病者的一部份仍能傳染淋病，必無疑問，再觀梅毒患者大半得病在三年以內，其傳染之本能，必相當可觀，簡言之，若與該項妓女性交，其受染機會之多，可不思而知。又據該所統計，妓女接客人數少者每月五次十次；多者每日十餘次，由此可知，妓女與嫖客間彼此傳染者每月當以萬計，非但至此，本市賣淫婦女實際人數更何至二千人，倘長此以往，其爲雀不可言喩。　　花柳病的傳染方式除先天性的以外，簡直百分之九十八以上由性交得來，決非「體虛」「濕熱」所能形成，與其消極地禁娟，還一如積極地提倡性道德，實綫　肉一致的性生活。打破「狎妓嫖娼乃風流雅事」之荒謬觀念，而視作最不道德的肉慾發洩。　　至於處置娼妓，只有禁止和公開兩種辦法，歐美各國有特種法律禁止娼妓，協助管理花柳病，甚至像蘇聯把故意得到花柳病者處以徒刑，但實際上各國還有私娼存在，這因爲其中含有複雜的社會和心理問題，而非法律所能强制辨到的。　　上海娼妓衆多，其原因不外乎經濟恐慌和風氣不正之故。她們迫於生計，希望增加收入，不得不出賣肉體。大都旣不識字又不懂預防，得病之後，又不去好好醫治，以致花柳病率激增，這種可憐的一　，把娼妓幾乎當做唯一的職業，除非替她們和她們的候補者羣解決職業問題，禁娼決難奏效，最多將公娼驅入地下流爲私娼，使管理上更爲困難。我國現在還沒有處置私娼和花柳病傳染的妥善法律規定，在紫娼之前，最好請法律家和社會學家供獻意見澈底解決這種複雜的問題。疥瘡  王士良　　在這個多動多亂的年頭，有一樣皮膚病最易流行的就是折瘡。雖然它只是人體表皮的病痛，可是生過疥瘡的人，都會知道它的滋味，領略到它的厲害。我們試想千千萬萬的人，在整天繁重的工作中，在僅有短促的睡眠的時間中，被無刻停息的滿身騷癢所磨折着，這種心理上與肉體上的苦惱，將是何等巨大！尤其在一般生活困苦的人們，沒有够多的更替衣服，被褥，給疥虫造成一個恣意繁殖的環境，他們的病可以或年累月的害下去沒有止境，這樣疥瘡影響了他們的工作效率，做事精神，無論讀書做工思索，都不能勝任而愉快，而且沒有好好的休息，身體抵抗力也會降低，容易得病，得病之後，旣不能安眠，更受害不淺，疥瘡化膿之後，還可以累及胃臓發生腎炎，那更是雙重的禍害了！　　疥瘡是人，狗，貓，或者其他家畜都有的一稱皮膚病，由於蜘蛛一類的昆虫，寄生在皮膚上所產生。在人身上的一種，叫Acarysscabuek，雌虫只有白蟲的十分之一大，0.4mm.；雄的還要小一半。它們有一固特別的脾氣，就是歡喜溫緩，懼怕寒冷。晚上，當你鑽進被窩內，暖溫溫地睡意瀰浸的時候，它也興高采烈地忙碌起來掘壕呀，生卵呀迎親呀，忙亂不迭，可憐的患者，雙手只得亂抓，奇癢難熬。到了冷天，它的活動慢慢减少，表皮上的症狀，也會輕一些。假使你以爲氣候轉了，病也會退消，而不加深究的話，那末它很可能給你再來一個　季攻勢的。　　疥虫在人皮膚上生活着，長成後交配，不久，雌虫急着生卵，獨自去掘巢洞，雄虫則徘徊躑躅在上皮細胞的骸骨中間，不久即　　死去。雌虫雖是大腹便便，但仍舊挖掘不息，把你我的皮膚掘出一條條的隧道。她一面掘，一面下卵，四個一堆，五個一疊，等到卵下完，她也自得地倒在隧道末端死去，我們常見生疥瘡的人，皮膚上除了小水泡丘疹痂皮之外，那些隱隱約約細絲一樣的綫條，盡曲折奇妙的能事的，就是那些雌虫所掘的騐道，用一只針把隧道挑開，有時可能把疥虫挑在針尖上。　　疥瘡的地位，大部份在皮膚柔嫰的地方，像手指中間，腋部，腹部，大腿內側，外生殖器，等等，最厲害時可以滿身發生膿皰，這種時候，會有很多人不相信是疥瘡了，他們以爲血裏必患有「毒」，所以表顯在皮膚上，就成爲膿瘡，於是叮住醫生，非要打「淸血針」把血裏的「濕毒」淸除出去不可，其實這些　　，完全因爲我們用滿染細菌的指甲，抓破了皮膚，細菌得機會繁殖的結果，所以把疥虫消滅了，不癢，不再去抓他，膿胞自然也不會產生，現在旣已知道疥虫寄生在皮面上，用藥直接撲滅最爲理想，假使要用「清血針」淸血，嶽非綠木而求魚嗎？而且事實上。根本沒有什麽藥可以淸血的，也根本沒有什麽所謂「濕毒」。　　不過，疥蟲活動範圍，並不只限於驢膚，所有患者的衣服，被褥，都有它的餘黨。假使光在皮膚上擦擦藥，當然不能完全把它消滅。有些人對事採取馬虎的態度，光是把藥塗在有瘡的地方，沒有疥瘡的皮膚，就沒有上藥。這樣一來就把許多疥蟲，輕輕放過，於是在他們用硫磺膏用上四五天後，不見完全消退，再多用幾天，仍是如此因而疑心，「所患的不是疥瘡吧」？「還是打針作根本解決吧」？這種想法，豈非中了疥蟲的詭計！最好的辦法，是把全身的衣袴·襪子·被單等等，完全放在開水裏消毒一下，把你滿身的瘀痂，用熱水肥皇洗個乾淨，甚至把疥蟲的隧道也打開，全身不論有瘡沒瘡的地方，都擦上硫磺膏。這樣，每天二次，連擦五天，五天後，再沐浴更衣，才算一階段，治疥的藥很多，但硫磺最爲容易買到，也最便宜。疥療常是一家或一個團體的病，因此有一個人生病，其他日常接觸的人，都要檢査一下，大家一起來醫，否則一個人好了，其他人身上的疥蟲，仍然可以爬到你身上來的。</p>

<p>春秋時代的悲哀  墨萸　　在街頭上常看到很多從前沉湎於　Jazz　的人現在也哼起Ｍarne　Song來，問問他們爲什麽竟又對　Jazz　深惡痛絕？回答是：Jazz　已經不新鮮了，時代沒有向上的氣象，人們對音樂，對一切藝術都失却深淳的愛好，祇需要淺薄的滿足感官的享受；這時代是够悲哀的。　　大戰後的時代是瘡痍未復，因此藝術本身也有創痛，其實這創痛正是影印着每一個人的心理上的不安和戰慄；時代沒有紀律，人們感覺到惶惑，於是漸漸的都冷淡了對藝術去發掘一點比較深邃的事物來的勇氣與熱忱。Life上祗要刊出一種以新鮮奇異作號召服裝式樣，很快的就感染到世界上任何一個破碎的角落；浸透了色情的十彩影片在上海尤其瘋狂了許多數不淸的市民，人們智慧的淺薄固然說明了藝術的憂鬱，而藝術的憂鬱正反映了這時代的悽愴。　　在音樂和其他藝術部門不能够支持這頺廢的時代的時候，照理文學是可以多少完成一點艱巨任務的，然而中國的文學現在芷流行着一種毫無理由的趨尙：痛駡制度，否定別人；本來對這時代裏社會制度的黑暗面作一種無情的揭發和暴露是可喜的收穫，於未來藝術的絢爛的前途可以完成堅實的奠基，但是駡人者是沒有這樣璀燦的理想的，許多人祗是因爲駡人是新奇，聲聽，够刺激，他們根本沒有深刻的去觀察一下，冷靜的硏討一下被攻擊的捱駡的對方以及它的制度有否値得保留的地方？因爲駡人是新鮮的，於是評多風起雲湧的新雜誌都用駡人做成風格，這正和人們要遺葉　Jazz　去親近　Marine　Song　之類一樣：時代剝削了人們精確抉擇的性能，而人們的淺薄也加增了時代的徬徨，這樣彷彿使我們敏感地聽到了這二十世紀五十年代的藝術的啜泣。　　政治上的紛囂蕪雜固然戕　了藝術的先天，但它還不可能使這時代裏的藝術就直趨沒落；眞正使我們感到悚懼的却是將來担當建立時代藝術的第二代靑年對眞知的泪沒，對行程的迷惘。因爲這樣他們將很容易對藝術更荒怠，更不嚴　；對時代更疏懶，更不負責。現在有許多靑年常喜歡以自已的戀愛經歷來做藝術的題材，頗像要繼承五四時代的傳統，你如果要問他爲什麽一定要這樣寫？他可能吿訴你：這是我用以獻給愛人的贈禮！許多新出版的集子裏不是在封裏或刊眉都這樣的標題着嗎？藝術工作者，尤其是靑年，在他從事耕耘的開始，就忘懷了這大時代裏在自己所愛戀的個人以外還有那麽一大片廣　的天地和無數的羣衆；時代到今日還不能體系地以誘導和啓示來穩定年靑人這種浮動的氣氛，藝術的後天必然更會蒙受到一種酷烈的傷殘。　　科學在這個世紀裏面的輝煌成就無形中加重了藝術對時代的負祖。當人們在瘋狂的想像着怎樣利用原子能來揭開第三次世界大戰以前，我們很期待藝術能够完整的去支配人類的性靈，拿得出像米萊那樣的兩幅「晚鐘」與「拾穗」來也好，因爲這樣多少可以澄淸一下時代對人類的飛揚跋扈的煽惑，讓人們稍爲能够得點深淳的憧憬。　　我相信藝術並沒有想背叛時代，而時代實在辜負了藝術，這時代是够悲哀的。寒梅·幽蘭與薔薇  曾寶琳　　仲夏多綺雲的黄昏，歸舟又一次靠近了堤岸，由小生長在北國的南方孩子第一次踏入故鄕沃黑的土地。故鄉對我陌生得好似一個路人，隨着桃源　奔流的溪水我沿着上山的小道蹣跚，讓自己的影子滲和在老樹蔭中，讓微風又一次吹開回憶的門扉；——　　並不是太還的日子，就在今年春天，一個細雨迷濛的日子，母親送我由繁華的上海到明媚的西子湖畔，帶着一顆孩子跳躍的心，我開始踏進了大學的邊緣，學校在錢塘江畔六和塔旁的山上，不少紅色的建築物點綴在綠林的深處。鐘樓的國旗隨風飄揚，禮拜堂前的樹正在抽芽。溪邊的女生宿舍，總課室前的石獅……以至於路旁的野花都開始踏進了我的生活中。不久母親回去，我開始感到生疏而孤寂。在細雨春寒的日子裏我見到梅花謝。又見梨花開。只一夜的風雨已滿地花似雪的梨花。推開窗見到錢塘江被細雨迷住了江面。我感到孤帆載不盡遊子的懷念！　　「我要住在三零一號的房間，可以見到錢塘江，而且與我家的汽車，電話都是同一樣的號碼！：」一串尖利的聲音由隔壁房中傳出，我好奇的推開了房門，見到一個中年的婦人，穿着藏靑的絲絨大衣，不難看的臉。小巧的身材，站在三〇三號房間的門口，只再走一步，我即見到房中站着一個與我相彷年紀的女孩子，撓看一張嘴在連繼不斷的叨嘮着：「學校爲何沒有床？桌子？椅子？爲何沒有書架？…」我忍不住的吿訴她：「日本人留給我們房子住己太理想了！」她驚訝的看着我，免强的笑着說：「你也是剛來的嗎？」「嗯！」我回答她！她接着問：「你住在那一間？」「三百零五號！」「啊！那就是隔壁了！那麽請您替我佔住這一間！下午我叫人送床來，明日我再搬進來！」。我點頭的答應下來了。我開始注意到她有一雙誘人的眼睛，高的鼻子和二片相稱的唇。似如不是太瘦的身材與彎了的背，該會是一個够十全的美人了。不久我見到她們在樓梯口不見了。於是我又沈在寂寞的深淵裏。第二日的傍晚她果眞來了：當一切整理完了以後，她到我的房中閒談。她話很少，我僅只發現，她是一朶喛房中的嬌花·倔强而且自高·不知是那一次我的心更接近了她。她父親是上海一個大商人，六十多歲了僅只有這一位千金。她有二個母親。而她的生母却是第二個，在物質上他享受着繁華，舒適。在精神上她見到世界的另一面，使她接近了悲哀的邊缘。她見到人情的冷酷與恨毒，不知幾何時用悲淚咽去了童年的歡笑。不知幾何時護冷酷的風雨摧殘了她童年的紅花。於是她學會了驕傲，冷酷和不坦白，因爲她不相信世間會有幾個眞誠的心。因爲她珍惜她自己的情感，不願用自己的眼淚博取他人無情的訕笑，他懂得羅曼羅蘭說悲多芬：「過份的冷酷和沉默就是對人類狂熱的愛，」她酷愛着新文藝而且有一顆進取的心，我感到她像寒梅似的高傲。　　後來三零三號的房間又搬入了二個不同性格的女孩子，比較高的一個纖弱而溫雅，蒼白的臉上總露出一絲微笑，長圓的臉上有一個笑渦，一對無神的小眼也有一些和靄的光芒，她愛把自己沈在幻想的夢境中，愛注意別人對她的小動作，談笑及一切舉動都好似吃不消似的輕而嬌，對人接物像一朶幽蘭似的軟弱而淡淡的馥香圍繞人旁，一個週末的旁晚，我曾伴和着這一朶軟弱的幽蘭沿着宿舍前的石道走上鐘樓，我們見到第一顆星上升又凝視着月亮出來她向我低述着一些美麗不合現實的夢想在月色中我第一次見到她的小眼在閃着希望的光芒，我們見到錢塘江面銀波與帆影，我們的心像是更一次的接近，忽然他緊握住我的手，沈着的吿訴我：「回答我什麼是父愛？我徒然的有着父親，可是我郤喪失了父親的愛：他把對兒女的愛移到另一個不相干的女人身上，家中多加上一層疼苦，母親流着更多的淚水，爲什麼上一代鑄下了錯誤，郤讓我們來接受疼苦，爲什麼父親不爲兒女想一想？…」她低泣了！我等了半響才迫出一句：「金錢是罪惡的源泉。」這一夜我被高低不齊的思想擁擠着幾乎使腦袋破裂，我想爲何她不剛强起來？爲何她仍沈榖在幻想的濃液中。　　三零三號另一個主人公都有着强健的體格，矮小的身材，橄欖似的臉，兩隻小眼睛時，閃着熱情和豪邁的光芒，二片薄得不相稱的嘴唇經常塗得怪紅的，她正像一朶開在牆邊的薔薇向任何一個經過的路人洒下她感情的花瓣，沒有一個星期她的大名已響遍了學校每一個角落，於是在每一個可以到的地方，我經常聽見她的笑聲在盪漾，她粗惡的嗓子在歌唱，沒有一點兒顧忌，對任何事不加一點兒思索，只是縱情的做着每一件事，讚美她的是天眞，活潑，說得難聽些郤成了輕浮而浪漫，可是我郤愛她的熱誠而坦白，她只求現實的快樂從不想着過去與將來，天大的事在她郤像微風似的，輕輕的吹過了，有一日她在宿舍高聲的說：「我決不幻想將來，我更不會有什麼計劃，因爲我知道那一些都給我失望，我見到成千成萬可愛的靑年在他們求學時有崇高的理想與目標，於是十多年埋首苦贖，大學畢業了，他們在職業的門外彷徨，可能一個優秀的工學院的畢業生郤埋沒在銀行中做練習生，可能一個劣等體育系的學生，却馬上在某一個局子裏做專員，一切我都隨着命運支配，什麼計劃？都是一些使人失望的幌子，是的！我只求現實的快樂，假如我也把自己沈在回憶與希望中，那只是自尋煩惱，我的生母在生我弟弟以後的一年被父親遺棄了，以後我們即隨着如今這個妖艷的父親的新太太，我在駡聲及苦作中長成，只要我一離開這不幸的家，我馬上即歡笑，我馬上沉在片刻的娛樂中使自己麻木，沒有事可以使我頽唐，消沉，我想說就說，愛笑即笑！我不免强自己的感情，我不怕別人訕笑！」她說得似乎很高興，但！沒有一個人搭腔！以後我們各人又忙着自己的功課。　　很快的暑假又到了，我們默默的分離了。　　如今我在故鄕的沃土上漫步，我隨着桃源澗的溪水閒蕩，感情像一匹無疆繩的野馬又馳回到錢塘江畔，我懷念着那兒三個不同性格的女孩子，但願蕉綠櫻紅的日子我們又在錢塘江畔相遇！沼上白勝  黄幻吾作致留滬木刻界的公開信  吳忠翰　　—陳烟橋，張樂平，王琦，荒烟，刃鋒，章西厓，野夫，楊嘉昌，劉　華，李　，邵克萍，余白歡，陳沙兵，史良　，諸同志—　　諸同志鑒：勝利，帶來了歡聚，聯合，團結，力量。我有說不盡話語，要與你們長談，有寫不盡文字來歡頌你們的功績。用無限的歡欣來觀賞你們的大作，用無限的熱情來盼望你們事業成功。然而，你們緊集在那麽令人神往的大城市里，我却躱在如此冷僻令人發笑的小誠市中，我深感萬分慚愧而無能，雖然，你們抵滬的消息來得那麽遲緩，不齊；有的來自報章雜誌，有的來自書簡抑或談話之簡。我雖日夜思懷欲修書致候，然我的行址又是那麽不停轉徒，工作又是那麽忙碌無閒，一直延至今日始有勇氣執筆投書，呈獻給你們之前。　　我自去年夏從贛南之圍逃出，越過贛閩粤山嶺，走到閩南的懷抱了，過去三四年來帶領中外木刻流動展覽隊巡迴三四省的邊沿，展出數次不下二三十次，此次提出殘餘作品五百餘件，到了上杭爲慰勞靑年軍展出三天，到了龍岩恰値勝利日應各界之請又舉行一次展出，到了漳州爲耙念厦鼓重光又出展了四天，乘輪抵達石碼大鎭，爲了厦岐尙未完全接收完竣，寄居旅社殊覺無聊，於是又出展了兩天，一直到了厦門，那時我與詩人雷石楡兄共事於閩南新報厦門總社，生活過得非常的愉快。以後我們聯合各藝術界文化界十餘人籌備「藝苑社」的事，爲了充實社務基金，於元且日舉辦「是外木刻曁書畫金石展覽會」成績空前，立即創刋號「詩歌與木刻出版，接着木刻與繪畫」，「小說與揷畫」亦陸　出版，銷路亦甚風行。及後我受聘於漳州幾家報館職務及兼敎了女中，於是我重返古老的漳城，在半年中我刻製了數十幀大作品，其中有羅淸楨先生之公子代刻的，因爲各報副刋均要我主編畫欄，爲此之故，一般愛好藝術之靑年紛紛投學，於是我主辦了木刻講習班，算是有些小成績。　　你們在申報上，前綫日報上，發表的大作都拜讀了，同時你們想在「九一八」那天在滬舉辦大規模「抗戰八年木刻展」均知悉了，我本來想檢寄一批拙品給你們，就是因爲我自己立即要到南京，决定自己帶去了，現在我正在忙着準備兩天後的展覽會，大槪在月底可動程來滬，希望你們把住址各投在申報「春秋」副刋編輯室，以備那時趕快與你們見面敬致熱烈的握手！一寸山河一寸血  葉勁風　11　　「大哥」，他對我點了點頭，表示已經把這裏的事，都佈置妥當了；「您得記淸楚；今天我得趕緊動身，先到瀋陽總部，在可能的短時間內，佈置一點重要的掩護，佈置的方式，現在無法說明，必得到了那邊，見機而作。　　「耀羣的事，我們約會的，不是計劃在今天下午兩點起的十二小時以內，辦理完畢嗎？萬一小老虎來得晚，您得把時間放寬一些，省得出亂子，呌我們的朋友受危險。這件事，大槪要勞動您一回，負完全的實任——最好等小老虎一到，您立刻再跟對方的朋友，通一次電話。」　　「您到北平去的時候，這裏當然由〇四號負責，直到您回來爲止。可是回來之後，最好不再離開這裏，因爲我到了本土之後，也許需要您去帮一把力。您將來去，也得先到瀋陽，用第八第十二或第十五式的名義和方式，再到本土，——也得看將來的變化行事。　　我們緊緊地握着手。由於兜心底發出的感情衝動，我們都禁不住淌下了幾點熱淚；雖然仍舊掛着笑險，同時也不知所云的彼此預祝着，可是說話的音調，不覺已失去了平常的意味，聽起來，好像虔敬的信徒，夜間在肅靜的神壇前，喁喁地背誦着祈禱文似的。　　直到他動身的一刹那之前，我一直不敢正眼去注視他。偶然從兩人吐出的濃烟之中，偸偸地瞧他一下，他却是那樣的靜穆，靜穆得像年老的修道士一般，但是眉宇間的一股英毅之氣，仍舊說明他的正大，果敢，英勇，豪爽，堅忍，而富有機智。我敢担保，在小小的島國上，絕對產生不了這等光風　月的人物。　　預期的時間還沒有到，小老虎—一個十二三歲的孩子，己經踏着穩定有力的步子，跨進屋子裏來了。　　（要是您沒有親眼見過像小老虎這一類奇質異禀的特殊人物，也許您以爲他祗是舞台上，或銀幕上，或武俠筆記中的傳奇脚色。所以關於他的事情，我有些不敢儘量記載。）　　「老伯——我來哪。」一雙眼圈，又大又圓，配上特別長的睫毛，和兩顆黑多白少的大眼珠，不時的閃動着，放出很銳利的一股光芒來。個子很高，像南邊十五六歲的孩子，一張小圓鼓臉，皮膚相當黑，笑起來倒是一口整齊的白牙齒。還是前幾天給耀羣送那封長信來，鶴兄給他和我介紹，讓他叫我老伯，從此就規定了我們之間的一重關係—取消了階級或等級，只保留着一種友誼上的親密。　　「很好，你跑得眞不慢哩」。我點點頭，微微笑着，表示喜悅和歡迎。　　「好。差點沒跟兎子幹上；要不是我有事」。他閃動着滴溜滾圓的大眼珠子，表示他有些氣憤，同時也很重視自己的資任。　　「噢」？我很想聽他說點什麽，可是時間不許　，「慢着，我們就得動身，你要是覺得累，可以休息一會兒，上前屋子去吃點什麽，我還得通通電話」。我可沒把他當平常孩子看待，走了三十多里地，要是多繞了幾個圈子，恐怕還得加上十幾二十里哩。風  征驊　　風！吿訴我，要用怎樣美麗的字彙，和恰當的形容詞來比擬你？你關心潮汐的漲落，花草的消長，烟雲的變幻。……你吿訴我們季候的消息，泥土裏的消息，吿訴我們人世的寒冷或溫暖，你眞是敏感而熱情的詩人；以你獷悍的氣質來說，你又是英勇無比的鬥士；你嬌憨得如天眞無邪的孩子；又溫柔得如蜿孌的少女。　　當你吻着翩翩的蝴蝶；吻着在水面畫着圓弧的垂柳；吻着綠油油軟綿綿的芳草；吻着一切姹紫嫣紅爭奇鬥姸的花卉；而且替它們各種姿態不同的舞蹈輕快地打着節拍，那時萬物都展開了它們的笑靨欣幸地接受你的蜜吻；並且向你絮絮地低訴它們心靈裏的秘密。　　當你如猛獸那麽地咆哮，以你不可抗拒的力量捲起了澎湃的怒濤，向着那莊嚴地屹立着的岩岩衝激，高唱着豪壯粗獷的戰歌，飛濺起一萬丈的浪花，在爽朗的晴空下炫耀着奪目的光彩，那是如何動人心魄的壯列塲面啊！　　有時你在澄碧的波紋上樣着圓潤的笑渦，匆匆地寫着你美麗的抒情詩，像要抓住稍縱即逝的靈感似的，你聽！淙淙的流水不是在以鏗鏘的音調吟哦着嗎？　　有時你如駿馬般地從重　疊嶂上奔馳過去，追逐着飄忽的白雲，捲起了排空的松濤，懸崖的瀑布，奏起你生命的全音階，在萬藉裏共嗚，交織成諧和的旋律。　　有時你輕盈地跳躍在少女們波紋似的軟髮上；有時你依依地送着遊子的歸帆；有時你爲了含羞的新月遮上了黑色的輕紗；有時你吹散了滯重的積霧，帶來了一天繽紛的霞彩；有時你把霜花飄上了紗窗，織成美麗的圖案；有時你廣擴着春的消息，把新的生命吹噓給萬物。　　當黄葉飄零的時候，你嗚嗚地哭泣着，替它悽哀地唱着輓歌；當嫩芽初透的時候，你銀鈴似的笑聲又在淸新的空氣裏浮漾起來了，而且替它染上了綠意，披上了春妝。　　現在，窒息的氣氛正緊緊地壓着我們，第一顆黄昏星剛升了起來，又沉入了無邊的黑暗裘，沈鬱的夜色如墨汁一樣的浸沒了大地，一切在忍受着蛻變前的苦痛，爲了孕育它新的生命，風啊！你能不能捲去這時代的陰霾呢？音樂絮語  洪因　　現實的無情，世俗的煩惱，使一個人對任何事物不感興趣；結果造成了心理的不健康。記得心理學家張耀翔先生曾經說過：「一個人要心理健康，必須對樣樣有興趣！對工作發生興趣，對學問發生興趣，對人發生興趣…」但是現實的無情使人們心理受創，往往會至於不可收拾。身體上受了些微創傷，可以在一度甜睡後復原，但是心靈的創傷會使你澈夜不能闔眼，即使用了安眠藥片，而在藥物效用終了之後，那些煩憂依然起伏你的腦際。更有甚者，你第二次的睡眠，就非仰仗藥片不行，恢復你的心理健康，恢復你對於各種事物的興趣，應當仰仗於心理的藥物。　　我們不敢强調音樂眞可治病，但是可以斷言，音樂所以被重視，是因爲：它至少可以冲淡你的心靈煩惱，我們不敢說音樂萬能，但好的音樂，至少會鬆懈你的過分緊張的神經。　　貝多芬在他的遺囑里說：「使我不曾自殺的是音樂。」親愛的朋友：你相信音樂確有着這偉大的感應力嗎？</p>

<p>自由談鳥  少夫　　「千山鳥飛絕」這句詩，以科學立塲來說，是不正確的。　　從冰封　凍的北極，到熱帶的沙漠，密林　　，　渺汪洋中的孤島，以至南極，可以說無有無鳥跡處。在地球上，鳥是分佈最廣的一種動物。　　原因有二：　　一，鳥是流血動物，能適應氣候寒暖，調節體溫，不像昆蟲類或爬蟲類的冷血動物。　　二，鳥有强力的翼，自陸地到海洋，自高山到平原，不受空間的阻礙，與樓居陸上的動物又不同。　　雖然如此，也並不是任何一隻鳥能生活於任何一個塲所的。　　夏季，人往往流汗，這是生理上一種抗暑的方法，島沒有汗腺，不能出汗的，但牠的激動的呼吸却在　節體溫。夏天，鷄常張口急促地喘氣，就是這個道理，而在熱帶的鳥，比如駝鳥，頭與頸都沒有羽毛。　　生活安易，影響於鳥的精神作用也很大，熱帶海洋上，羣棲於珊瑚礁上的鳥類，此如信天翁，軍艦鳥，終年足食，且無敵性生活，久而久之失去危險的觀　，也就不知對人類的警戒，所以我們往往用棒可以打死牠們，用手可以楠捉牠們。　　因爲中國飛离硏究社最近將展覽羊鷹，（一種生長在印度高原的禿鷹類）想到關於鳥的一點常識，以供大家參考。除此之外，我又知道鳥的生活行爲有若干處與人相彷彿，看了鳥，頗足以給我們不少　示。雷同的原因：為了生活　鄉鎮教師都到上海來了  小石　　一二星期前，連續到我家裏來的戚友，爲數約有十餘人之多。他們都是鄕鎭敎師，他們已决心離開鄕鎮小學（都是京滬滬杭兩路附近的各鄉鎭）。他們來自不同的鄕鎭，但他們跑到上海的目的則一致。有的已在上海找到敎職，有的正在進行謀取敎職。筆者進一步的追問他們，爲什麼此次都不約而同的捨棄鄕鎭小學而都跑向都市裏來，他們的答案，一言以蔽之！都是爲了生活。據他們說：勝利以後的鄕鎭小學敎職員的薪津，小得僅及上海三輪車夫的一天所得，例如一兩萬元一月的有之；兩三萬元一月的有之：就是最好的也不超過四五萬元一月的。膳食都須自理，而且有的還要挨欠，不能如期發放。區區之數，個人的一口粥都不易維持，其他衣着的添置，家人的生活，概付厥如。所以平日狼狽的情形，在鄕鎭上簡直無出具右。　　上星期五筆者因事回鄕（相中上海百里外的一個鄕鎭），這鎮上原有完全小學一所，學生總數達四百餘人，上學期敎職員的薪津是二萬元一月，而且時常挨欠，敎師在中途爲了一口飯，迫不得已而曾一度向學生暫借米糧，不料結果因爲遭到一部分家長的不滿而中輟。因之有的兼做單　，有的兼擺攤頭，冀獲微利，　補收入。而且早經同心一致，等待這個學期結束，都得脫離學校。因爲敎職員都受相當知識，深明敦育大計，未便中途棄敎，所以，一忍再忍，忍耐到學期終了。此次　都向都市裏來了，一面向市敎局申請檢定登記。一面分託戚友四處找尋位置。所以現在上海的教師，已呈供過於求的　　。而反觀鄕鎭上呢？學校開學則近，敎職員始終無法齊聘。　　上海今年公私立小學敎師的　　，大槪都在十五六萬元至二十五六萬元之間，比之鄕鎭小學　有天壤之別。其間城鄕教師待遇的懸殊，設不速謀平衡，則未來的危險，何堪設想！敎育本無城鄉的界限，敎師最低限度的生活，自當不能過分差異。學齡兒童個個需要入校讀書，眼見得鄉鎭小學敎師都在跑向都市了，那末鄕鎭孩子誰去担負這個敎育的責任呢？如果鄉鎭學校因爲開學期近，原有敎師離校而一時無法應付，隨便由人權充敎師，濫汙充數；則對於敎育的本質與效率，更有危險的影響。所以，這個已經擺佈在我們面前的事實，希望負有敎育責任的當局曁熱心人士，火速共謀對策——搶救鄕鎮孩子！關于陳鶴  西廷　　選舉上海小姐時，陳逆鶴竟担任大會報吿員，結果被羣眾檢舉，當塲出彩。關于此公，在勝利之前，筆者僅在偽歌曲中見到大名，他是淪陷時期「保甲歌」的作曲者，「反英美協會」中的理事；勝利之後，「榮任」南京大都會舞塲樂隊的指揮，今春首都各界在國際聯歡社舉行慰勞盟軍大會時，他仍然是「舞樂」的指揮，並且得意忘形地高歌黄自先生的「熱血」，當時台下觀眾曾有所耳語，但南京人比較客氣，沒有當塲檢舉，只是在事後有人寫信問中央日報的中央副刋編者，編者僅僅幽默地答復一句：「大槪是根據徵用日俘條例吧！「其後，沒有下文。不過，首都地方法院曾經根據檢舉把他拘留偵訊過，後來也就保釋了。想不到這次又在上海小姐面前高歌「熱血滔滔」了，怪不得羣情憤慨，把他驅逐出塲。　　由于這次事件，我又想起了「大東亞進行曲」的作曲者梁逆樂音及僞自警團進行曲的作曲者陳　歌辛。他們在那兒？教育圈  南木　　某某模範是上海出名學府許多家長皆以子弟入此校肄業爲榮，所以學生常常過多，再加上去年從大後方復原歸來的學生後，人已擠得不亦樂乎，差不多每隻敎室都有七十人以上，所以今年暑假招考新生極少。　　近有某學生家長，硬要將子弟插入，校方吿之實無餘額，但這位學生家長仍不甘心，要求校方多開一班，於是校方再吿訴他說沒有地方。那位學生家長竟慷慨的答應出資三百萬元添造一些新校舍；現在這些校舍還正在興建中。這雖然是爲了自己的子弟，不過這種造福學子的精神，是値得我們欽佩的。辯護律師  劉忠彪　　一個判處外刑的被吿。對他所請的一位辯護律師說：「我化費了這許多的錢聘請了你，結果非但沒有滅刑，却仍逃不了一死。」　　律師：「國有法律，這麽大的罪孽，叫我如何辯駁呢？老實說，沒有我，你的罪刑將更重呢！」　　被吿：「什麽！判了外刑，難道還不能算是更重嗎？」　　律師：「你眞是不懂，死，是最痛快的，生於憂患不如死於安樂；今天你被判死刑，此那十年五年或一輩子的鐵窗風味要好得多多了」報壇逸話奇怪的報紙  征凡　　「狂人日報」與「乞丐新聞」　　從前巴黎有過兩種駭人聽聞的報紙：一種是「狂人日報」，專門登載各地瘋人院中瘋人的形形色色，頗受讀者歡迎；另一種是「乞丐新聞」，專爲乞丐張目，登載慈善家們的行蹤，以便一般乞丐去求乞，因此極有吸引乞丐購閱的魔力。　　無獨有偶的，奧京維也納也有過一種「乞丐新聞」。它是在一九一四年，由維也納乞丐俱樂部發行。起初用謄寫版油印，每份售價半辨士。內容都是關於乞丐的福利消息，乞丐趣味讀物，乞丐的生活狀况及徵求出讓等廣吿。業務發展得非常順利，日銷四千份以上。訂閱的不單是乞丐，甚至連紳士們定閱的也很不少。該報到上次歐戰起，就停刊。匃牙利的某貴族曾搜羅該報從創刊直至停刊全份，在一九二〇年在巴黎拍賣時，價達八千法郞。　　專登退稿　　一八三〇年，英國有一種「退報」。它的宗旨，是專門刊載他報不採錄的退稿。起初創刊時，投稿者紛至沓來。大家都想借一席地來揚眉吐氣。但是實際上，報上的文字都是庸俗下流，不堪一讀，編排也紊亂不堪，讀者生壓，因此銷路每况愈下。最後編輯者竟異想天開，通吿各投稿者，所投稿件，非但不酬稿費，並旦須納取手續費。這樣一來投稿者無異登廣吿，誰還願意來投稿？因此營業日衰，這種別開生面的「退報」，不得不宣吿關門大吉。　　人吃新聞　　有人說：「新聞紙是人們的食糧」，而世界上竟有把新聞紙來充幾的事情。第一次歐戰後，歐洲發明一種印有新聞記事的麵包，用無毒的油墨所印，閱讀完畢，就可以把他吃掉，作爲早餐。　　在歐洲還有過一種報紙印刷在闊尺餘，長二尺左右的白紗布上。閱後滌洗一過，字跡立刻消滅，便可以當手帕使用。或派作別的用塲。　　夜光報紙　　西班牙馬德里曾經經發行過「羅比那勒報」，用混有　質油墨所印刷；因此即使在黑暗的晚上，也可以非常淸晰地閱讀。今日日  中繼譯　　人物素描　　日本的裕仁皇帝，至今還住在東京城中區那遭過轟炸，圍有　溝的皇宮內。有時候他也輕衣驅車，出來跟農夫和工人談話。往常他對國家或議會有所發表，總是用運日本人也聽不懂的「朝式」語；惟其因爲聽不懂，所以日本人更對他表示尊敬，現在呢，他有時侯用無綫電對議會和國民演說，可不再用「朝式」語了，先前他叫日本人民爲「臣民」，如今却改稱「人民」了，據說有一次爲了對他挨餓的人民表示同情起見，他自己也在花園裏吃野草呢！　　不打倒日本皇帝而把他民主化，要算聯盟國佔領日本的最大成功之一了，但這一點却因另一神人的建立，而受了蓋罩——這個神人就是麥克奧塞將軍。在古老的日人傳統思想中，他高高居上，日本人只知道麥帥和他的妻·子住在美國大使館的堅壁內。他們說麥帥的公子會與一個日本公主結婚。　　離皇宮不到一哩的一個小山頂上，他們也許可以看到這所大房子，但是日本人只能在麥帥驅着黑色克迪拉車，隨着一個駕吉普的衛兵，到第一保險公司大厦去辦公的時候，才得見到他的廬山眞面目。　　在第一保險公司的頂　　門上寫着「盟軍最高司令」幾個大字。這兒　帥每天得消磨七個鐘頭的時光。他背對前臨日比谷公園的窗口，坐着，抽着板烟與來客談戰事，談佔領，也談俄國，提到史太林的時候，麥帥總愛稱他做「此人」。麥帥比往常淸瘦了，兩手也有點兒發抖，但毫無疑間的，他是一個佔領主。　　日俄戰爭（一九〇四—一九〇五）以來，麥帥研究日本已經有四十二年了，所以他自信有資格統治日本。糟糕極了  索貝　　DDS的食品店，被人改做DDT」。　　「車水馬龍」被寫做「抽水馬桶。」　　「紫羅蘭」的招牌，被聽做「猪玀來！」　　靑年進行曲開頭一段：「烙火漫天，血腥遍野，中華民族遭受着空前的浩刧，我們在苦難中長成，我們在大時代的焚爐裏鍛鍊成一個革命的靑年。……」不知被誰改做：　　「鬼話連篇，胡說八道，瞎七搭八，浪費了寳貴的時間；我們在胡調中長成，我們在大時代的飯桶中鍛鍊成一個吃飯的靑年—……」連環漫書　三毛從軍記（八三）  張樂平作掌故人力車滄桑史  甘來　　—從誕生到死亡—　　行政院爲改善國內交通狀况，曾在本年六月間舉行會議，通過廢除全國人力車。本市市政府已奉到是項命令，人力車同業，大感恐慌，車商業公會，特在七月七日，公開招待新聞界，發表呼籲，要求收回成命。　　奉令淘汰　　八月二日，本市市政府第四十一次市政會議中，決議通過：「本市人力車現已停發新照。奉令淘汰人力車案，呈復行政院自明年實施，以免加重目前失業問題。」同時，本市人力車夫職業工會籌備委員會也已經遞呈行政院，請將廢除人力車期限，由三年寬放爲十年。　　人力事的禁絕，看來祗是時間問題。　　關於人力車的是否能够如限消滅？或者在它淘汰以後，我國的交通將成如何面目？眼前還不易推測準確。　　讓我們回溯人力車流入我國的歷史，約略述之：　　人力車的發明者，據說是一個僑居日本的美國人。第一輛人力車的出現，是在一八六七年。　　東洋車　　同治十年（西歷一八七一年），上海有法國人購車數十輛，在「租界」載客往來，是爲人力車流入我國之始。但另有一個傳說：上海開埠之初，日人首先將車運入，所以名喚「東洋車」，起先拉車的都是日本人，因爲言語隔膜，改由國人經營。　　原始型的人力車，兩輪高大，與馬車後輪相去不遠，車輪用木製，行動時轆轆作聲，車身也感震撼。直至中華民國三年，方才盛行空氣橡皮　。　　初時，上海所有的人力車不過二三百輛，民國紀元前六年，已增到八千輛，中華民國二十五年，據兩「租界」工部局的登記數字，與市區的人力車數目，合計在兩萬輛左右。　　除上海以外，大江南北的鄕村市鎭如南通，如畢，阜寗，鹽城，寳應，象山，靑浦，奉化等，共有人力車二千餘輛，大部是向都市整輛購買得來的。　　一輛人力車的成本，在二十五年是五十五元至六十元。　　一輛車子　　人力車的原料，可以分爲：車胎，鋼，鋼絲，軸領，軸心，鋼珠，帆布，鋼架，木料，漆布和塔件。起先全屬舶來品，二十四年以後，除金屬部份，已能自製。國人自造的車胎，以大中華橡膠廠的雙錢牌最著各，不過英商鄧綠普廠的出品仍佔相當勢力。　　本市的人力車行，共有一百二十餘家，大小不一，有的擁有車輛五六百，有的祇有二三輛。上海的人力車夫，據二十六年間佔計，約有六萬餘人，眼前本市人烟稠密，覓職困難，人力車夫的人數當然有增無减。根據人力車商同業公會理事長陳志堯稱：本市人力車商車夫，共有十五萬人，連家屬合計，依靠人力車爲生者當在三十萬人以上。　　人騎人　　車夫向車主和貸車輛，分日夜兩班，日班由上午六時起，至正午止，車租爲一千二百元；夜班自下午二時起，至八時止，車租爲一千三百元。日班租車，可以延到下午二時以前交車，夜班可以延到翌晨六時以前交車，不另收費。不過，實際上人力車夫的被剝削，生活的痛苦，眞是罄竹難書！　　人力車的顧客，大都是中等階級以下的人。冷街僻巷，凡是公共車輛不能直達的地方，人力車依舊是人們唯一的代步工具。尤其是下雨天，隨處可以聽見：「黄包車！黄包車！」的叫聲。　　人力車果眞會淘汰嗎？這「人騎人」的交通器具，應該淘汰嗎？你以爲。</p>

        <h1>1946.08.23</h1>
<h3>Frequent Political Activities in the Capital, Broad Exchange and Negotiation of Opinions, President Song Meets Zhou Enlai for the First Time</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Marshal Ma departed from Beijing by plane to Xun on the morning of the 23rd, then proceeded to Guling. Ambassador Stuart will be responsible for negotiations in Beijing. Furthermore, Minister Bai of the Ministry of National Defense visited Marshal Ma at 6 PM on the 22nd, discussing matters for nearly an hour before departing. The Ambassador then visited Marshal Ma again at 7 PM, and they dined together.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] On the 22nd, political activities in Beijing were frequent. The government, the Communist Party, and the American side engaged in cyclical meetings, all striving to open the door to peaceful negotiations. Mr. Fu Jingbo, Ambassador Stuart's personal advisor, told reporters that current contacts are merely a broad exchange of opinions on principles and procedures for negotiation, with no progress made. This serious situation of unresolved entanglement is causing the intermediaries a great headache. When formal negotiations can resume is currently difficult to predict. The government will replace President Song Ziwen as the negotiation representative. On the 22nd, Mr. Song frequently met with American and Communist Party figures, indicating this possibility. It is said that Chairman Chiang already favored Mr. Song while at Guling. Marshal Ma received Mr. Song at his residence on Ninghai Road at 9 AM on the 22nd, and they talked for an hour before Mr. Song departed. The Ambassador spent almost his entire day, from morning to night, in political talks. At 9:30 AM, he met with Minister Yu Dawei at the embassy. At 12 PM, he visited Marshal Ma and Admiral Cooke. At 4 PM, he met with Zhou Enlai. Another noteworthy meeting was Song Ziwen's first reception of Zhou Enlai at his private residence at 10:30 AM. Song told Zhou that he was acting in a private capacity and not representing the government. Zhou departed at 11:40 AM. In the morning, Yu Dawei had visited President Song to inform him of the details of the recent peace negotiations.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Contact regarding peace negotiations resumed frequently on the 22nd. In terms of form and direction, two differences from the past can be seen: (1) President Song's appearance in the peace negotiation camp indicates the government's urgent desire for peace, willing to use different methods to achieve the goal of peace. As for the Communist side, Zhou Enlai's visit to the Ambassador today was arranged by Wang Bingnan of the Communist Party delegation, who visited the embassy beforehand, reversing the past practice of Marshal Ma and Stuart inviting. This indicates that the Communist Party also wants the Ambassador to continue to act as an intermediary. It is reported that during the Stuart-Zhou meeting on the 22nd, the Ambassador inquired about the Communist Party's broadcast in Zhangjiakou, but Zhou only replied that it was not a general offensive order, but a call for self-defense. Zhou stated on the 22nd that peace must ultimately be achieved, but it depends on how Stuart and Ma proceed, saying, "Peace is always possible." According to those familiar with the content of the negotiations, Zhou had never made this statement before.</p>
<h3>Minister Bai Issues Statement: Government Still Aims to Restore Peace Through Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 21st] Minister Bai of the Ministry of National Defense met with reporters this afternoon. When asked if the government considered the broadcast from Zhangjiakou Radio and the editorial in the Yan'an Liberation Daily equivalent to a declaration of war by the Communist Party, Mr. Bai replied, "I personally hope this does not indicate the existence of a state of war. The official attitude in Nanjing is that conflict can still be stopped and peace restored through political negotiations. We are not yet prepared for war." The reporter then asked if the Communist Party expanded the conflict zone and actively prepared for all-out war, would the government still adopt a passive wait-and-see policy, awaiting a peaceful solution? General Bai said, "If we are attacked, we will of course repel them. The situation on the Longhai Line is exactly like this." General Bai could not foresee the KMT and the communists officially declaring war, and said: "We will never let this kind of situation occur, and we don't need to have this situation until our determination to solve all problems through negotiation is eliminated. Every war is initiated by the Communist Party. If we are not attacked, we will never do anything. We have tried our best to avoid continued bloodshed, because China is in urgent need of peace." General Bai said that although Yan'an had issued a mobilization order, the government had not taken any counter-measures. He did not know that the National Army had new actions to deal with the overall offensive. The reporter then asked that, if it reached the decisive stage, could the government army defeat the Communist army? General Bai said: "Up to now, I have not estimated how long it will take for the National Army to defeat the Communist Army." General Bai emphatically stated that "Chairman Chiang and the central government, despite the military provocations of the Communist Party, still do not give up the pacification policy. We will find ways to reconcile with the Communist Party, and I think that this goal can be achieved with the help of Marshal Ma." Regarding the rumor that the government had issued an ultimatum to the Communist Party, informing them that if they did not abandon the siege of Datong, the National Army would attack Yan'an and Zhangjiakou, General Bai said he had not received accurate information. He confirmed Minister Peng Xuepei's statement that the Communist Army had gathered all its forces and was approaching the outskirts of Datong.</p>
<h3>Expanding Government Structure</h3>
<p>No Concrete Measures Yet Discussed [Our Guling Dispatch, 22nd] Chen Lifu said: Expanding the government structure and recruiting various parties have not been discussed in concrete terms. According to a certain person close to the government: Zhang Junmai, Zeng Qi, and others suggested convening a constitutional draft review meeting as soon as possible. The government has the same feeling, and it is said that relevant people are studying this issue. This matter is imperative in preparation for the National Assembly.</p>
<h3>Chen Cheng Returns to Nanjing</h3>
<p>Tang Enbo Visits Bai Chongxi</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Chen Cheng, Chief of Staff of the Ministry of National Defense, flew back to Nanjing at 3 PM on the 22nd. After a brief rest at his official residence on Guling Road and having dinner, he went directly to the Ministry of National Defense. It is said that Chen is temporarily staying in the ministry because his official residence is under renovation.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Tang Enbo, Garrison Commander, visited Minister Bai at the Ministry of National Defense on the 22nd. Tang Zong, Director of the Police Administration, also visited Mr. Bai.</p>
<h3>Ninth Executive Group Arrives in Hankou from Xi'an</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 22nd] Lu Jishi, the government representative of the Ninth Executive Group of the Military Mediation, the American representative Ke Zhujin, and the communist representative Xue Zizheng, a group of more than ten people, flew to Hankou from Xi'an at 5 pm yesterday. According to Lu, the group will make a short stay in Han, and then fly to Ping to report on the mediation process.</p>
<h3>American Representative of the Changchun Branch of the Military Mediation Arrives in Shenyang</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 21st] After taking office, Colonel Tyson, the chief American representative of the Changchun Forward Branch of the Military Mediation, accompanied by Cai Zonglian, flew to Shenyang from Changchun at 10:30 AM on the 21st. After getting off the plane, he went to the headquarters to visit Commander Du, talked for about 30 minutes before leaving, and then summoned the American personnel who were staying in Shenyang for talks. At 3 PM that day, he was still accompanied by Cai Zonglian and flew back to Changchun, and will go to Harbin to visit Lin Biao for a courtesy visit after taking office. The Shenyang group originally planned to go to Fushun for work on the 21st, but now it has been suspended.</p>

<h3>Conflicts Near Anping</h3>
<p>Group to Investigate the Truth Today</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 22nd] The KMT and Communist armies near Anping are still facing each other across the North Canal. Both sides are shelling each other, and there have been losses on both sides. The 25th subgroup of the Military Mediation Department, which specializes in mediating conflicts in this area, will depart for Xianghe on the 23rd to investigate the truth of the conflict. The subgroup consists of government representative Lieutenant Colonel Wu Nengding, Communist Party representative Colonel Wu Kejiu, and American Colonel Sha Jing, and may also visit Baodi and other places.</p>
<h3>Sun Liren Assumes Two New Positions in Changchun</h3>
<p>[Our Changchun Dispatch, 21st] Sun Liren took office today as the Commander of the Fourth Pacification Zone and the Commander of the Changchun Garrison. He met with reporters from Changchun at his resting place at 11:30 AM. It is said that the Communist army's order to launch a comprehensive disturbance is a manifestation of doing many unjust things. However, as of the time of the conversation, there was no major conflict in the Northeast. Mr. Sun passed through Changchun eighteen years ago when he returned from abroad, so this pacification period is actually his second time to Changchun. Mr. Sun is alert and determined, and believes that the overall situation is extremely optimistic.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tianjin, 22nd] Shenyang News: Sun Liren, Commander of the New First Army, has succeeded Liao Yaoxiang, Commander of the New Sixth Army, as the Changchun Garrison Commander. Liao will lead the New Sixth Army to garrison in the Siping area.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Imitates and Prints Legal Tender in an Attempt to Disrupt Finance</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 22nd] Military Intelligence: The Communist Army recently imitated the Central Bank's 1,000-yuan banknote produced by the Dadong Bookstore Chongqing Factory in the 34th year of the Republic of China, and issued it in large quantities in an attempt to disrupt finance. The difference is that the paper is rough and the printing is blurry.</p>
<h3>Road Repair Work Awaits, Joint Road Protection Agency to be Established in Ping City</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 22nd] The Pingjin Railway Bureau has not received any orders, and the road repair work is still awaiting. Also, the transportation authorities will unite the party, government, and military to establish a joint office in Ping dedicated to maintaining transportation in order to further protect the railway lines. The planned roadside protection villages will be directed by this agency.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] On the evening of the 23rd, the reporter visited Yu Dawei and asked whether there was any change in the peace talks. Yu said that the government was determined to seek peace, but today the flames of war are raging, and the Communist Party cannot disclaim its responsibility.

<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 22nd] The full-scale war in Shanxi Province has unfolded. After the Communist Army of Shanxi occupied Hongdong and Zhao counties, it continued to attack Linfen. Linfen is now in urgent condition. The Communist Army in the northern section of the Tongpu Railway is also advancing south from Xinzhou, having approached Taiyuan. There are fierce battles everywhere on the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Road today. Datong in northern Shanxi is also in a tight situation. He Long personally led the First Field Brigade and a tank team of about 10,000 people from Fengzhen to Dalan Village, northwest of Datong, to reinforce.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 22nd] Transportation circles report that west of the northern section of the Pinghan Road, the Communist Army has recently dispatched a large number of troops towards Zhangjiakou and Jehol, seemingly preparing for Zheng Jiemin's memorandum to the Communist Party on behalf of the Military Mediation Department, which stated that in order to support the self-defense war in Datong, the National Army had the freedom to take action against Zhangjiakou, Chengde, and Yan'an.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 22nd] Negotiations for a temporary truce have not yet reached an agreement. The Taiyuan Central Group of the Military Mediation Department invited representatives of the commanders of both sides to hold a joint meeting for two hours on the afternoon of the 21st, with the Datong issue still being the focus of the dispute. In order to break this deadlock, the group specially requested instructions from the Beiping Military Mediation Department.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 21st] The atmosphere of war is getting stronger and stronger. Reporters have contacted both the government and the Communist Party, and both sides have expressed this view. Following the two major battlefields of Datong and Central Plains, the next major battlefield will be Jehol. Both sides have made considerable preparations. In order to eliminate this unexploded war invisibly, the Military Mediation Department has made efforts. This is the joint meeting of the three shaking Jehol groups and the highest commanders of the KMT and the Communist armies, although the three members of the Military Mediation Department once again instructed the group to mediate, and the group also convened a preparatory meeting again on the 18th, but both were fruitless, and this unsuccessful meeting will become an excuse for the responsibility of war.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 21st] Due to the silence of the negotiations in Nanjing and Guling, coupled with the Communist Army's constant destruction of roads in eastern Jehol and western Liaoning, as well as the frequent movements of the Communist Army in the Jilin-Harbin area, the situation in the Northeast, which had been calm for many days, has become heavy again. Since coming to Shenyang, Dong Guolai has visited Du Yuming several times to report on the parallel process. It is reported that Zheng will move from Changchun to a certain place in western Liaoning, but will still go to Changchun within days. Du is recuperating due to a minor illness and will travel later. (2) According to Zhao Jiaxiang, the actions of the Communist Army in recent days are expected after the start of the Green Yarn Curtain.

There was a fierce battle in Huoxian, Shanxi Province on the 21st. The Communist Army gathered in the northeastern area of Linyi is preparing to attack the county seat. The Communist Army in Hebei Province, the Central Hebei and Southern Hebei military regions are also actively expanding their troops, and prohibit the export of food and daily necessities from the liberated areas. The Communist Army in Gaoyi, Gaocheng, Lecheng, Huolu and Jingxing in southern Hebei has increased. The Shijiazhuang area has increased by more than 23,000 people. The cloud of sorrow covers the sun, and startled wild geese are everywhere. The hope of peace, in the sound of Yan'an's order to mobilize, has scattered like floating smoke.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The Communist Army has gathered 50,000 troops on both sides of the Jiaozhou River east of Gaomi City, Shandong, and its main force controls the east-west area of Gaomi on the Jiaoji Road, attempting to block the government's restoration work on the road and supporting the encirclement and attack of Qingdao by the Communist Army.</p>

<h3>Amidst the CCP's Call for Mobilization, the Activities of Communist Armies Inside and Outside the Pass, the Communist Army in North China Divided into Three Major Forces</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 22nd] Amidst the Communist Party's call for general mobilization for war, a certain military authority here who is familiar with the overall dynamics of the Communist Army today discussed the deployment and activities of the Communist Army inside and outside the pass. He said that the Communist Party's regular army has a total of about 800,000 troops. Except for about 450,000 of them deployed outside the pass, the rest are scattered in various provinces in North China. After the battle of Siping, the Communist Army outside the pass was severely damaged. Since then, it has actively supplemented and reorganized its troops to restore its original strength. About 17 brigades are stationed in Jehol. The Communist Army in the Chifeng-Chengde area will take action. Although the Military Mediation Department has instructed the three Jehol groups to convene a meeting of the highest commanders of the KMT and the Communist armies, it will ultimately be fruitless. As for whether the Northeast can continue to maintain its rough state of peace, it is not dared to say. As for the Communist Army in North China, it can be divided into three major forces. One is Liu Bocheng's troops of about 170,000 people, based in the Taihang Mountains, with its headquarters located in Baiyan Village near Wu'an. The current activity is the offensive along the 300-li Longhai Road, but it has obviously been frustrated. The second is He Long's troops of about 56,000 people, based in northern Shanxi, with its headquarters located in Fengzhen. The current activity is the siege of Datong, which seems to be quite successful, but the consequences are not dared to be predicted. The third is Chen Yi's troops, based in eastern Shandong, with its headquarters in Linyi (one said it has been moved), about 150,000 people. The main activity now is in northern Jiangsu. In addition, there is Nie Rongzhen's troops of about 30,000 people, based in Zhangjiakou, and its main task is to maintain the corridor between Chahar-Suiyuan and the Northeast, while defending Fu Zuoyi's eastward expansion. However, a part of it has recently moved to Yingxian area south of Datong, seemingly trying to attack Datong with He Long. Judging from this, except for the Northeast, all the Communist Army inside the pass has been launched. As for the Communist Army's so-called regular army of 1.2 million and militia of 2 million, it is actually an exaggerated propaganda. Although the militia has a considerable number, they are all vulnerable. If the Communist Army has airplanes, there will be no more than 20.</p>

On the 22nd, about 3,400 dan arrived, which is still rare. The price for early rice was 40,000, and for mid-season rice, 39,000. People's minds are very settled.</p>

<h3>The Government Attaches Importance to Agricultural Development Work, China and the United States Implement Agricultural Technology Cooperation, Zou Bingwen Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss Inspection Experiences</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch] The Sino-American Agricultural Technical Cooperation Team has already moved from North China and Northeast China to West China and South China for inspection. Dr. Zou Bingwen, the leader of the team, returned to Nanjing ahead of schedule due to other important matters. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and met with reporters to discuss: The team, organized by Sino-American agricultural technology experts, departed from Nanjing in early July for inspection. Initially, they went to Beiping to visit the enemy-operated North China Agricultural Experiment Station, the Shijiazhuang Agricultural Experiment Branch, and other agricultural management institutions and equipment; then to Tianjin to visit the enemy-operated reclamation projects near Junliangcheng and to discuss the promotion of exports of domestic agricultural products with export merchants. On the 5th, they departed from Tianjin to Changli to visit the enemy-operated fruit tree business. On the 10th, they arrived in Shenyang to visit the enemy-operated Agricultural Science University and the major manufacturing companies of enemy-operated agricultural tools, disease prevention medicines, and serums. On the 11th, they arrived in Changchun to visit the Agricultural Development Department, the Continental Scientific Research Institute, and various agricultural companies established by the enemy in Manchuria, and had detailed discussions with local agricultural technicians (including Japanese technicians). On the 13th, they arrived in Gongzhuling to visit the enemy-operated Northeast Agricultural Experiment Factory, and had brief discussions with Japanese technicians who had not yet returned to their home country. Then they returned to Beiping from Gongzhuling and went to Xi'an. I then returned to Shanghai on behalf of the team. The team affairs are now presided over by Mr. Hutchison, the American team leader, and Mr. Shen Zonghan, our team deputy leader. They will go from Xi'an to Chengdu, Hankou, Guangzhou, Liuzhou, Taiwan, Zhejiang and other places for inspection. I plan to go to Hankou or Guangzhou to participate on September 2. The team is scheduled to complete the inspection by October, and will spend six weeks after returning to Nanjing to compile the entire inspection report. The time allocation is: two weeks to complete the first draft, two weeks to discuss the content with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and relevant agencies, and the final two weeks to revise the first draft as the final report. The report content is divided into three parts: (1) China's agricultural construction plan, (2) Improvement plan for special agricultural products, (3) Sino-American agricultural cooperation plan, for the reference of the authorities in implementing policies. Ten American agricultural experts participating in the team's inspection are scheduled to leave China on November 15 and return to their country to report on their duties. In addition, the team also sent four small groups of personnel to inspect the special agricultural product business of tea, silk, tung oil, and wool, and will also complete the task in the shortest period of time.</p>
<p>Impressions of This Trip</p>
<p>Regarding the impressions of this trip, Mr. Zou stated: The various agricultural institutions operated by Japan in North China and Northeast China, although their intentions were unpleasant, yet their technical achievements are worthy of reference and application by our country, which is known as an agricultural nation. From all aspects of the enemy-operated agricultural institutions, we deeply feel that the Japanese government can fully understand the importance of agricultural construction, is very determined to improve agriculture, and has a relatively reasonable organization, appropriate personnel, and sufficient funding. Therefore, in the past 30 years, under the economic aggression in Northeast China and in North China in the past few years, the achievements in operating agriculture have been considerable. According to the survey, the Japanese government spent more than 10 million Japanese yen annually on agricultural research in North China, and the technicians sent to China were all well-known experts in the country, with generous treatment and an average service life of more than 20 years (the head of the agricultural experiment station was treated as a specially appointed official), so whether it is animal husbandry, forestry, or agricultural products, all have great achievements. Mr. Zou continued: Now our government also deeply feels the importance of agricultural construction, and hopes that from now on, there will also be appropriate organization, personnel, and funding to engage in agricultural improvement and stabilize the lives of farmers. I dare to assert that the future achievements will certainly not be inferior to the achievements of Japan's operation in Northeast China in the past 30 years. Finally, Mr. Zou told reporters: Because I need to participate in the report prepared by the Sino-American Agricultural Technical Cooperation Team, I will not be able to attend the second annual meeting of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization recently held in Denmark. I have now agreed with Minister Zhou to change to Xie Jiasheng as the representative to attend, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is submitting a request for approval.</p>

<h3>Chu Minyi, a Traitor, Executed by Firing Squad This Morning; Application for Retrial Rejected by the Jiangsu High Court</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou, 22nd Dispatch] After Chu Minyi, a traitor, applied for a retrial again, and was rejected by the collegial panel of the Second Criminal Division of the Jiangsu High Court, consisting of Presiding Judge Kong Rongzhao, Judge Shen Zhaoming, and Judge Ling Fuyao, the reporter specifically approached Han Qi, Chief Prosecutor of the Jiangsu High Prosecutor's Office, to inquire about the date of execution. He was told that it has now been decided to carry it out at 8:00 AM on the 23rd at the execution ground of the Third Prison at Shizikou. Prosecutor Li Shudong will still be appointed as the supervising officer.</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou, 22nd Dispatch] After Chu Minyi, a traitor, applied for a retrial, and was rejected by the Supreme Court, his wife Dong Shunzhen applied for a retrial again, hoping to die for her husband. On the morning of the 22nd, the Suzhou High Court issued a ruling No. 11 on retrial, ruling that Chen Shunzhen's application for a retrial should be rejected. The reasons are recorded as follows: According to Article 413, paragraph 1, item 6 of the Criminal Procedure Law applicable to the special criminal case procedure in the first item of Article 1 of the Special Criminal Case Procedure Regulations, the application for a retrial based on the discovery of definite new evidence is limited to the extent that it is sufficient to recognize that the person who has been sentenced should be acquitted, dismissed, exempted from punishment, or sentenced to a lighter crime than the original judgment. It is not possible to merely criticize the sentencing of the original final judgment as a reason for applying for a retrial. The legal intention is very clear. In this case, the defendant Chu Minyi, because of the traitor case, was judged by this court in accordance with Article 2, paragraph 1, item 1 of the Punishment of Traitors Regulations, and found guilty of colluding with the enemy to plot against the country, and sentenced to death, and approved by the Supreme Court for review. The applicant, namely the defendant's wife Chu Chen Shunzhen, is applying for a retrial this time, only on the grounds that "the defendant followed the National Father and ran for the revolution for many years. This time, after the enemy country surrendered, he was able to reform and prepare to hand over and maintain security, and should be sentenced leniently. Furthermore, Shen Songting of the former National Institute of Technology, Wu Chunjiang of Jinling Middle School, students of the National Nanjing Temporary Middle School, Xi Guansheng of Shanghai Guanshengyuan, and the Jiading Houlun Silk Cocoon Factory have all presented facts that prove that the defendant is beneficial to the people, which can also be used as new evidence for applying for a retrial." The court found that the defendant's crime of colluding with the enemy to plot against the country was certain and the circumstances were serious. The original final judgment has been explained in detail. The fact that the defendant followed the National Father and ran for the revolution for many years, and maintained security in Guangdong after the enemy country surrendered to wait for the takeover, even if it is newly discovered evidence, in law, there is no reason for which he should be acquitted, dismissed, exempted from punishment, or sentenced to a crime lighter than that detailed in the original judgment, that is, it clearly does not affect the establishment of the defendant's crime of colluding with the enemy to plot against the country. Especially for the so-called acts of the defendant in the puppet office that were beneficial to the people, even if the evidence is certain, Article 3, paragraph 1 of the Regulations on Handling Traitor Cases only stipulates that the sentence may be reduced, but not necessarily. It is still a matter of judicial discretion and falls within the jurisdiction of the court. According to the previous explanation, it is also not a reason that the party concerned can use to apply for a retrial, and should be rejected.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Reflections on Pu Yi's Testimony in Tokyo</h3>
<p>Since the Tokyo International Tribunal was established in May and began trying Japanese war criminals, there have been many remarkable scenes. However, what has attracted the attention of the general public more than anything else so far is the testimony of the puppet emperor Pu Yi. Pu Yi's testimony in the court was frank and straightforward. Although it fully demonstrated his cowardice and desire to survive, upon careful examination of his testimony, we can see that his frank statements about the Japanese invaders' deliberate aggression against China and the various threats he faced during his tenure as a puppet emperor serve as powerful evidence for confirming and executing the Japanese war criminals. Pu Yi's testimony in the Tokyo court is still ongoing and has not yet concluded, but based on the parts he has already testified to, we would like to express our views as follows:</p>
<p>First, Japan's invasion of China was a long-planned and premeditated action. Its occupation of the Northeast was not an accidental event. The masterminds behind it were the Japanese militarists, especially the Kwantung Army in the Northeast at the time. Pu Yi's testimony in the Tokyo International Tribunal further proves this point. He said: "At that time, the commander of the Kwantung Army, Shigeru Honjo, sent Staff Officer Colonel Seishiro Itagaki to inform me that Zhang Xueliang's regime in the three northeastern provinces was arbitrarily imposing harsh taxes and causing suffering to the people, and that Japan's vested interests were also being infringed upon. Therefore, they planned to drive out the warlords, eliminate the communists, and establish a new country." This shows how the Kwantung Army deliberately destroyed China's unity and launched its invasion of China. Honjo, Itagaki, Doihara, and others should be held responsible for the establishment of the puppet "Manchukuo," but the Japanese militarists, despite having different factions, were essentially a unified whole, so even those who did not directly participate in the "Manchurian Incident" should also bear joint responsibility. Due to Pu Yi's frank testimony, the Japanese militarists' deliberate aggression against China is undeniably guilty. If the Japanese war criminals currently on trial in Tokyo are sentenced to death by the International Tribunal, it would be a just and legitimate act.</p>
<p>Second, Pu Yi's status as a puppet and a pathetic imbecile is vividly depicted in his own testimony. Because he could not "avoid danger," and because he was afraid of death and could not consider the greater good, he fully demonstrated his imbecilic nature. Although he himself was only a puppet and could not be held directly responsible for Japan's rule over the Northeast and its exploitation, as a citizen of the Republic of China, he willingly became a puppet of the Japanese militarists, undermining the integrity of China's territorial administration. While this may be understandable from an emotional standpoint, it is absolutely unforgivable under the law. His actions should be subject to fair judgment under Chinese law. Therefore, after carefully reading Pu Yi's testimony in the Tokyo International Tribunal, the second thing that comes to mind is that our Ministry of Foreign Affairs should actively negotiate to ensure that Pu Yi and his fellow traitors are returned to Chinese courts for trial.</p>
<p>It has been reported that Pu Yi's appearance in Tokyo to testify was under the custody of the Soviet authorities, and that there was a prior agreement with the U.S. military authorities that he would be returned to the Soviet Union after his testimony. During his time in Tokyo, the Soviet authorities kept Pu Yi under strict surveillance, prohibiting him from speaking to anyone. It is understandable that Pu Yi, as a person awaiting punishment, should have his freedom of movement restricted. However, we find it puzzling that Pu Yi, as a criminal of the Republic of China, should be subject to Chinese law. When the Soviet army entered and occupied the Northeast, they took him into custody and should have extradited him to China afterwards to be brought to justice. According to news agency reports, China hoped to extradite Pu Yi, and the Soviet side had previously agreed but now reserves its position. If the reports are true, it is difficult to understand. We would like to formally inform the Soviet authorities here to extradite Pu Yi to the Chinese courts as soon as possible to be subject to the sanctions of Chinese law.</p>
<p>Pu Yi was the first person to serve as a puppet in the Second World War. Because of Pu Yi's precedent, there were later figures like Wang Jingwei, Chen Gongbo in China, as well as Quisling in Norway and Pétain in France. In the history of the evolution of puppets, Pu Yi is undoubtedly an ancestor. However, when we think of the history of the evolution of puppets, looking at Wang Jingwei, Chen Gongbo, and others after Pu Yi, we cannot help but feel that each generation is worse than the last. Pu Yi was naturally imbecilic and afraid of death. Although his appointment as a puppet constituted a crime, he was a genuine and complete puppet, so in his own conscience, he must have been filled with distress. He was still able to tell the truth, admitting that he had no freedom, and even when the defense attorney for the war criminals insisted that he accepted the puppet position to avenge the Republic of China and to seek the happiness of the people, he insisted that "this is counter-propaganda." This shows that even as a puppet, he still had a sense of nation and ethnicity in his words. As for figures like Wang Jingwei, after the war of resistance had already begun, the national policy had long been decided, and they were in the rear, never having suffered any pressure, yet they voluntarily withdrew from the war of resistance camp and joined the enemy, directly selling out the country for personal glory and willingly becoming slaves. They cannot be compared to Pu Yi. As for other puppets of lower caliber, they shamelessly served the enemy, and when they were brought to trial under national law, they spouted their traitorous arguments, trying to justify themselves and attempting to shirk responsibility. Compared to Pu Yi's frankness and straightforwardness, they should be ashamed beyond measure!</p>
<p>What we detest even more are those new puppets after Wang Jingwei! If they disregard the public will, betray the interests of the nation, and willingly become slaves to foreigners, this is the interpretation of a puppet. Then it is not difficult for us to imagine who these new puppets are. After the war, the people need stability, and the nation needs an opportunity to recuperate, but these new puppets have violated the will of the people and sold out the interests of the nation, putting up attractive façades on the surface while concealing endless poisons inside. Their lack of freedom and inability to make their own decisions is probably even worse than Pu Yi's. We have seen these puppets who once betrayed the interests of the Chinese nation being purged one by one, and we are confident that these new generations of puppets will eventually be purged in the high tide of the national independence movement.</p>

<h3>US Issues Ultimatum to Yugoslavia: Unprecedented Severity Since Pearl Harbor, Demands Release of US Airmen Within Two Days, Yugoslav Representative Trembles Upon Receiving Ultimatum</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Comprehensive News] The tense relations between the United States and Yugoslavia can be said to have reached their peak. According to a United Press International dispatch from Washington, the United States issued an ultimatum to Yugoslavia on the 22nd, demanding that all detained airmen from the downed U.S. aircraft be released and sent across the border within 48 hours (i.e., 3:00 AM Greenwich Mean Time Saturday, or 12:00 PM Shanghai time on the same day). Otherwise, the United States "will immediately request a meeting of the United Nations Security Council to take appropriate measures." The ultimatum, in an extremely stern tone, refutes Yugoslavia's claim that this was merely an accidental incident and states that the Yugoslav government acted intentionally and must therefore bear full responsibility for the matter. The ultimatum is filled with indignation and is unprecedented in its severity since the Pearl Harbor incident, accusing Yugoslavia of "blatantly violating international law and the United Nations Charter" and intentionally attacking the U.S. aircraft. It further states that Yugoslavia's explanations are completely untenable and that the American people are outraged.</p>
<p>The ultimatum was issued after Acting Secretary of State Acheson and Secretary of State Byrnes, who is in Paris, had two long-distance telephone conversations across the Atlantic. At 5:00 PM, Acheson invited the Yugoslav Chargé d'Affaires to the United States, Mr. Makajdo, to meet him in his office. After Mr. Makajdo arrived, reporters gathered in front of the office. The two men held a closed-door meeting in the office. Five minutes later, Mr. Makajdo emerged, pale and trembling, and rushed out of the crowd of reporters, saying only, "The State Department can inform you of this matter." It is noteworthy that the United States had just issued a serious protest on Tuesday regarding this matter, and now, without waiting for Yugoslavia's response, has issued an ultimatum. It is widely believed that the United States has made up its mind to fight Yugoslavia to the end to maintain its international reputation.</p>
<p>U.S. Ambassador to Yugoslavia Patterson, accompanied by a military attaché, flew to Gante on the southern Austrian border on the 22nd to confer with Marshal Tito, who is vacationing there. It is widely believed that this will be the first opportunity to obtain Yugoslavia's response to the ultimatum. However, according to a Yugoslav spokesperson on the 22nd, Marshal Tito may reject the demands in the U.S. ultimatum.</p>
<h3>Concerns US International Standing, Byrnes Determined to Force Showdown</h3>
<p>According to a United Press International dispatch from Paris, Secretary of State Byrnes is prepared to wager the United States' international standing and success in the peace conference on this matter. Byrnes believes that the outcome of the current peace conference is no longer important, but a showdown with Yugoslavia must be won, because if Yugoslavia can shoot down a U.S. aircraft and get away with it as if nothing happened, the entire military and diplomatic position of the United States will be severely damaged.</p>
<p>According to well-informed sources at the peace conference, during Secretary of State Byrnes' meeting with Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj on Wednesday, Kardelj's attitude was "tough and rude," which made Byrnes feel that the United States' patience with the Yugoslav Tito government had reached its limit, and a stern ultimatum had to be issued. As time gradually passes, the tension around the world is also increasing. If Yugoslavia does not provide a satisfactory response after the 48-hour deadline, the matter will be urgently handled by the Security Council.</p>
<h3>Britain and Soviet Union Remain Silent</h3>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from London on the 22nd, the evening newspapers reported yesterday that Foreign Secretary Bevin is expected to meet with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Kardelj in Paris today to inform him that "British-Yugoslav relations will be severely damaged if President Tito continues to cause trouble." However, there has been no response from the British government regarding the U.S. ultimatum to Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Moreover, Moscow newspapers have published reports on the dispute between the United States and Yugoslavia, but without comment.</p>
<h3>Dardanelles Issue: Britain and Turkey Respond to Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Comprehensive News] Regarding the Dardanelles issue, according to a Reuters dispatch from London, the British note was delivered to the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in London on the night of the 21st. The content is generally the same as the note, opposing the Soviet Union and Turkey jointly defending the straits. The Turkish reply to the Soviet Union was also delivered to the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in Turkey on the 22nd, firmly stating that it could not accept the Soviet Union's proposal to have only Black Sea countries participate in new negotiations. The Turkish government also absolutely rejected the Soviet Union's proposal to jointly defend the straits with Turkey, but agreed to convene an international conference with relevant allied countries to discuss the matter. It is said that the Turkish reply was drafted after consultation with the British and American ambassadors.</p>
<h3>Sweden Purchases Radar to Deal with Mysterious Missiles</h3>
<p>[Reuters Stockholm, 21st] The Swedish government plans to purchase radar equipment from Britain to detect mysterious missiles falling within Swedish territory. It is expected that a deal will be reached soon.</p>
<h3>Control of the Danube: Britain and US Form Committee</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 21st] The Koberenz Radio Station announced that a joint British-American control committee has been established in Duisburg, Germany, in the British occupation zone, to control the Danube River and its tributaries. The controlled area extends 180 miles from Duisburg to Karlsruhe and is located on the border of the U.S. and French occupation zones.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union and Norway Establish Border Agreement</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Oslo, 21st] The Norwegian Foreign Ministry announced today that the Norwegian delegation, which went to Moscow in early August, has reached a border agreement with the Soviet Union. Before the war, Norway bordered Finland. Since the Soviet Union annexed the Petsamo region, Norway has become a neighbor of the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Switzerland and Soviet Union Restore Diplomatic Relations</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 21st] The Swiss Minister to the Soviet Union, Mr. Fruechtuge, arrived here today to take office. Mr. Fruechtuge is the first Swiss diplomatic representative since the two countries recently restored diplomatic relations.</p>
<h3>Soviets Use German Factories to Manufacture New Weapons</h3>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 21st] Extremely reliable sources from the Soviet occupation zone in Berlin claim that the Soviet Union, together with German technicians, is stepping up the manufacture of new-style V-weapons, special jet-propelled aircraft, rockets, and other heavy weapons in several German armaments factories. At least six factories are engaged in this manufacturing. Although the Soviet Union does not allow allied forces to investigate its armaments factories, it is known that the Siemens factory in Berlin, the Telefunken-Wolfshagen Nitschasenwiek factory, and the Kranenbudingen factory are all manufacturing various parts for the latest V-weapons. The Madge branch of the Krupp factory is manufacturing heavy weapons for shipment to the Soviet Union. The Nata oil factory near Meissenburg in Saxony province is manufacturing fuel for jet-propelled aircraft, but the production of this fuel is currently not very high.</p>
<h3>Soviet Cruiser Arrives in Black Sea Port, Strengthening Psychological Warfare Against Turkey</h3>
<p>[United Press International, London, 22nd] According to an exchange of telegrams" published today, Marshal Zhukov, commander of the Soviet forces in the Odessa military district, and his staff have arrived in the Romanian Black Sea port of Constanta aboard a Soviet cruiser. This trip marks the beginning of a tour of the Soviet troops stationed in Romania and Bulgaria and also strengthens the psychological warfare against Turkey.</p>
<h3>Nine US Warships Visit Portugal as Base Negotiations Take Sharp Turn</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] A broadcast from Paris on the 22nd: The United States' latest giant aircraft carrier, the USS Roosevelt, arrived in the Strait of Gibraltar on the 22nd.</p>
<p>[Reuters Lisbon, 21st] As the United States and Portugal formally negotiate the long-term lease of the Azores Islands to the United States as military and air bases, eight U.S. warships, led by the aircraft carrier USS Roosevelt, have arrived here for a friendly visit. It is believed that this move may lead to a more positive turn in the U.S.-Portuguese negotiations. Two U.S. special negotiating representatives, Mr. Coulberson, head of the West European Division of the State Department, and Major General Rude, commander of the U.S. Army Atlantic Air Transport Group, have been in discussions here since July 14, hoping to achieve a satisfactory resolution to the Azores base issue. When the U.S. warships arrived here last Friday, the negotiations were gradually coming to a standstill. The main difficulty lies in the Salazar government's unwillingness to take any action that would undermine the sovereignty of any part of the Portuguese Empire, as well as the safety of the Portuguese people in future wars. It seems that the visit of the U.S. warships has accomplished the following results: (1) To give the Portuguese people a new understanding of aviation; (2) To promote the feelings of the United States and Portugal; (3) To make the Portuguese people understand the importance of the base; (4) It can give the Portuguese people some security guarantee.</p>
<h3>Mountain of Treaty Amendment Proposals to be Reviewed Soon; Connally Arrived in Paris Yesterday Afternoon; Rumor of Soviet Request for UN General Assembly Postponement</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Comprehensive Report] According to the Associated Press: Various committees of the peace conference are likely to begin work on the afternoon of the 22nd to review the draft treaty and amendments proposed by various parties. The plenary session will be held in the morning to allow the 21 member states to express their views on the opinions presented by the six non-member states on the previous day. Greece's demand for a response to Albania's accusations is almost inevitable, and Austria's request to reclaim South Tyrol may cause heated debate. Therefore, whether the committees will have enough time to begin substantive work remains a question. According to the United Press: (1) The Secretariat announced on the morning of the 22nd that it had received 250 basic amendments from the delegations of the member states. (2) The foreign ministers' representatives have 26 major points of contention regarding the content of the treaty. (3) The draft treaty for the five countries consists of 223 articles and countless clauses, and the counter-proposals submitted in the memoranda of the five defeated countries are likely to exceed one hundred. It is expected that the discussion of the various amendments will take a long time, so the duration of the peace conference cannot be predicted. It is rumored that Molotov has sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Lie requesting that the UN General Assembly, originally scheduled for September, be postponed to January next year, but this has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<p>Our newspaper listened to Paris radio: After the plenary session of the peace conference on the 22nd, US Secretary of State Byrnes left the venue shortly thereafter, accompanied by Mr. Bohlen, Advisor on Eastern European Affairs of the State Department. The two conducted a detailed review of the Yugoslav issue. This shows that the United States attaches greater importance to the above issues than to the review of the treaty.</p>
<p>In other news, US Senator Connally arrived in Paris at 1:00 PM on the 22nd.</p>
<h3>South Africa Demands Right to Speak on Disposal of Italian Territories</h3>
<p>According to Reuters: South African Prime Minister Smuts demanded the right to speak at the peace conference on the 21st regarding the disposal of Italian colonies. He said that South Africa had used its manpower and resources to liberate Italy's African colonies, so South Africa's opinions must be sought before deciding to transfer the issue to the UN organization for resolution. Representatives of Britain and its dominions attending the peace conference on the 21st held a meeting under the chairmanship of Bevin, including Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, Representative Clarkston, and New Zealand Representative Mason. Bevin still insisted that if the four powers could not decide the future status of Italian territories, it should be decided by the UN organization, while Smuts believed that the matter should be resolved by the 21 countries. Australian Foreign Minister Evatt stated on the 21st that Australia had proposed several amendments to the draft treaty so that the treaty would be closer to the provisions of the Atlantic Charter and the UN Charter.</p>
<h3>Six Small Countries Present Arguments; Egypt Advocates for Libyan Independence, Austria Opposes Ceding South Tyrol, Iran Asks for Attention to Contributions to Allies</h3>
<p>According to the United Press: Representatives of six non-member countries of the non-peace conference attended the peace conference on the 21st and made a series of statements and requests. Representatives of Albania, Egypt, and Austria requested the division of Italian territory, and Albania and Egypt also requested compensation. Mexico and Cuba defended Italy, calling for "common peace."</p>
<p>The key points of the opinions presented by the representatives of Egypt, Cuba, Austria, and Iran are excerpted as follows: Egyptian representative Ghaleb emphasized Egypt's emphasis on general peace, especially the Italian treaty, and also mentioned territorial claims against Italy. If the peace conference agrees, the border between Egypt and Libya will be moved west of Bardia. In this case, the Garabulli Oasis, which was ceded to Italy in 1925, should be assigned to the Solum Plain. In addition, the Egyptian representative also requested that Libya should be established as an independent and autonomous country immediately. Cuban representative Ayala firmly demanded the recognition of the absolutely equal status of all countries attending the peace conference and participating in any international conference in the future, and advocated that all countries of the United Nations should participate in the drafting of the treaty. Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber said that if Austria had been able to obtain assistance from abroad at the time of the German-Austrian merger, it would have been able to resist the German attack. The majority of the Austrian people never supported the goals of German imperialism. We are grateful to the United Nations for liberating Austria. We have no other desire than to engage in peaceful life. As for ceding South Tyrol to Italy, it is unreasonable.</p>
<p>Iranian representative Raisma said that Iran also occupied an important position in the war against the Axis powers, especially in opening the Iranian border and allowing the United Nations to transport supplies to the Soviet Union to support the war, which was a great contribution. Therefore, Iran should have the right to participate in the drafting of the treaty. The Iranian delegation is about to arrive in Paris and will fully explain its views to the peace conference. According to Agence France-Presse, the Iranian delegation is scheduled to depart for Paris on the 22nd, led by State Minister Sababuty.</p>
<h3>Door to British-Egyptian Negotiations Still Not Completely Closed; Joint Statement Issued by Both Sides' Representatives</h3>
<p>[Reuters Alexandria, 21st] Egypt's rejection of Britain's proposed amendments to the British-Egyptian treaty, its response has been released tonight. It states: The Egyptian delegation believes that the suggestions and explanations obtained from the British side cannot change their attitude. Therefore, the Egyptian delegation declares that it will still base its decisions on the document submitted to the British side on August 1, 1946. Today, the representatives of both sides held a general discussion, and the result was that both sides could still exchange new ideas to complete the results that are beneficial to both sides.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: Although the British-Egyptian negotiations seem to have reached a stalemate, the joint statement issued by the representatives of both sides today stated: "The door for the exchange of opinions remains open." It is also learned that Egypt still insists on the conditions submitted to London three weeks ago. According to the note submitted by Egypt on August 1, there are three major points: (1) British troops should withdraw from Egypt within one year after the conclusion of the treaty. (2) The joint defense committee established by the treaty should be purely consultative in nature and can only be convened by both parties at the same time, and the note shall not automatically convene meetings. (3) The two governments should negotiate the future of the British-Egyptian Sudan based on the principle of the unification of Sudan and Egypt. Among them, the Sudan issue is the most difficult. Britain does not intend to grant sovereignty to Egypt before Egypt is willing to consider other principles.</p>
<h3>Jerusalem Full of Terror; Jewish Anti-British Sentiment Intensifies</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Comprehensive Report] Regarding the Palestine issue, all parties are waiting for the round table conference to be held in London to seek a solution. According to Reuters Jerusalem, the Arab Higher Committee is scheduled to meet on the 22nd to discuss the British government's invitation to participate in the London conference. It is rumored that the committee may request that former Jerusalem Mufti Hussein be sent as the head of the Arab delegation in the future London conference, but British officials have formally stated that if the Arab Higher Committee makes this suggestion, the British side will definitely reject it.</p>
<p>At the same time, the situation in Palestine is currently still tense and chaotic with terror. According to Reuters, Jewish militants distributed leaflets on the streets of Palestine on the 21st, stating that if the 18 Jewish youth terrorists who were previously arrested are executed, then "the streets of Palestine will be stained with British blood."</p>
<p>Our newspaper listened to London radio: In Jerusalem, from morning to noon on the 22nd, military vehicles drove endlessly. Important areas were covered with barbed wire and sandbags. Anonymous notices were found from time to time on the streets, stating that a certain institution building would be attacked, so there were now military and police on strict guard in front of all major buildings. It is reported that there are many British troops stationed in the suburbs. All of this seems to indicate that Jerusalem is on the eve of a storm.</p>
<h3>US Submits Territorial Report to UN Organization; Sets an Example for All Countries Based on the Charter</h3>
<p>[United Press New York, 21st] The United States took the lead today in submitting a lengthy report to the UN organization on the situation of its territories and island possessions. Therefore, reports from British territories and the Dutch East Indies and other regions may follow. The government's move is in accordance with the provisions of the Charter, that member states should submit reports on the economic, social, and educational conditions of the people within their territories who have not yet achieved full self-government. The United States reported on the situation of Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Panama Canal Zone, Guam, American Samoa, and the Pacific Islands. According to a spokesman for the British delegation, he had not yet received news from London about drafting the report, but member states were not obliged to submit reports before 1947. UN officials estimate that dependent people around the world living in such non-self-governing territories account for 8% of the total number.</p>

<h3>Japanese Civil Code Amended; Reduce Parental Rights; Improve Women's Status</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 22nd] The Japanese government has taken preliminary action to abolish the parental dictatorship system in the family, which has been repeatedly attacked as an obstacle to democracy. In accordance with the rights granted to individuals by the new constitution, the civil code has been amended. The new civil code reduces the power of parents and improves the legal status of women. Women are equal to their husbands and are no longer regarded as appendages of the family. Inheritance was previously limited to passing on to the eldest son, but henceforth parents can choose.</p>
<h3>Siamese Political Situation Complex and Confusing; Rumor of New King's Assassination Untrue; Panomrong's Cabinet Suddenly Resigns</h3>
<p>[Reuters Bangkok, 21st] The Siamese Regency today issued a statement formally denying the rumor of the Siamese King's assassination. The Siamese King, who is only eighteen years old, flew to Switzerland by plane on Monday due to health reasons. The police announced that a person who had not been allowed to enter the palace was found at midnight on Sunday, claiming to want to see the king. The person did not carry weapons and was obviously mentally deranged and has been detained.</p>
<p>[United Press Bangkok, 22nd] Siamese Prime Minister Panomrong resigned today because "opponents are conspiring to harm my health and undermine my service to myself and the cabinet." The Siamese King is currently traveling to Switzerland, and Panomrong's sudden resignation is extremely surprising. Local political figures believe that Foreign Minister Chayan Am and Justice Minister Navasava will be ordered to form a new government, both of whom are members of the most powerful Constitutional Party.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Attempts to Break Through the Straits; The United States and Britain Line Up Behind Turkey; Importance Exceeds Any Issue at the Peace Conference</h3>
<p>[United Press New York, 22nd] The noise of the Paris Peace Conference is negligible compared to the conflict between Western countries and the Soviet Union; the current conflict is being conducted behind closed diplomatic doors with classical diplomatic means. The major powers are conducting a war of nerves on one of the world's oldest political issues, the Straits issue. This issue touches on the Soviet Union's greatest ambition for three and a half centuries and is enough to determine control of the Middle East, so its viciousness far exceeds all other issues developing in Paris. Other countries have been negotiating the Straits issue since the early 19th century, and some even before this time. The United States did not act during the First and Second World Wars, but the United States cannot stand idly by in any competition involving the transfer of global power. The Soviet Union has made demands on Turkey, the protector of the Dardanelles Strait. This demand is not acceptable to Turkey or Western countries. The first point of the demand is that the countries of the Black Sea take over the management of the Straits. The second point is that the Soviet Union and Turkey take over the defense of the Straits. The so-called countries of the Black Sea are Bulgaria, the Soviet Union, and Turkey. The first two countries become one, and Turkey seems to be permanently in a minority position in any Straits conference. As for the second point, the Soviet Union will jointly occupy the coast of the Straits with Turkey militarily. If this demand is accepted, it will be equivalent to realizing the dream of successive rulers of the Soviet Union since Peter I three and a half centuries ago. Peter the Great was determined to break through the shackles of land and ice and go directly to warm waters. None of Peter the Great's successors aspired to as much as Stalin does today. The Baltic Sea is now largely in the arms of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union has restored its power in the ice-free ports of Lushun and Dalian in the East. The occupation of the Kuril Islands proves that the Soviet Union has entered the Pacific Ocean, and at present, Soviet forces are heading towards the Mediterranean and Europe.</p>
<h3>Main Reason for US-Soviet Conflict Lies in the Competition for Oil Areas</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London, 21st] According to responsible sources, by 1965, the United States will have to import half of its normal gasoline consumption from abroad, which is enough to explain part of the reason for the United States' policy in the Middle East and the Arctic Circle. The US, British, and French forces have lined up behind Turkey to oppose the Soviet Union breaking through the Straits. The United States is preparing to share the responsibility for the peaceful management plan of the Dardanelles Strait, which is still in its early stages. Other countries are concerned about how much the Soviet Union will insist on its demands, how long Stalin is prepared to exert pressure, and whether this move is a showdown or just the beginning of bargaining. The world peace that can be glimpsed in its answers is more than what the Paris Peace Conference has achieved so far. . The production of American synthetic gasoline is not enough for application, so the American government openly supports a certain gasoline company to obtain oil field exploration rights in the Middle East. The United States has expressed special concern about the situation in the Dardanelles Strait, Palestine, and the Middle East. Recently, the United States has taken defensive measures, held naval exercises, and is scheduled to hold exercises in the Arctic region this winter to prevent attacks from Alaska, which can all be explained here. The Soviet Union currently lacks gasoline and is planning to seize the oil fields in Romania and Austria and is trying to obtain oil field exploration rights in northern Iran and the Middle East. In short, the oil field issue has great political importance.</p>
<p>[US News Service Washington, 21st] The US newspapers have supported the suggestions on international cooperation to develop the world's oil resources, which were broadcast by the State Department officials on Saturday night, and urged to take steps to implement them as soon as possible. The Washington Post said: "The State Department official's advocacy of the United Nations to control the development of the world's oil resources is a promising development in American foreign policy. To avoid war, the causes of war must be removed, and the lack of managed competition in the world's oil supply is a potential cause of war."</p>

<h3>Head of Economic Experimental Farm Reported for Using His Authority for Personal Gain and Embezzlement; Complex Insider Story Involves a Wide Range of People</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The takeover work investigation team recently received a secret report accusing Zhang Binzhen, head of the Shanghai Economic Experimental Farm of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, of using his official position to engage in large-scale malfeasance when he took over the Japanese agricultural and forestry farms and livestock farms when victory first came to Shanghai. When the Japanese army was in Shanghai, they had established dozens of agricultural and forestry and animal husbandry units, which were all taken over by Zhang Binzhen at that time. After Zhang took over, he sold the dairy cows. According to the informant: the total number reached more than 1,000, and the dairy cows were replaced; Zhang also divided and sold the land of the farm without authorization. It is verified that Zhang is a confidant of Qian Tianhe, Political Vice Minister of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, so Qian may also be implicated in this case. According to the informant's report, Zhang Binzhen excluded dissidents and manipulated things, and there were dozens of counts of crimes of embezzlement and corruption. Yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock, Zhang Qingzhen, a member of the investigation team, specially summoned Zhang to the team for questioning for two hours and reviewed the files. It is reported that the inside story of this case is extremely complex and involves a wide range of people. Currently, the investigation team is working hard to collect witnesses and material evidence related to the case to clarify the truth of the entire case.</p>
<h3>Investigation Team Summoned Zhang Binzhen for Questioning Yesterday</h3>
<p>In other news: Wu Wangji and Zhang Qingzhen, two members of the investigation team, personally set out at 5:00 PM yesterday to investigate the Sun Tianchang plant case. They inspected Sun's factory on Peikai'er Road, Sun's residence on Beidang Road, and Sun's warehouse on Ximo Road. According to the two members: the evidence of Sun's crimes, such as offering airplanes, is quite solid, but Sun has also presented evidence that is beneficial to him, so the case still needs to be investigated rigorously.</p>
<h3>Hearing of the Wen Lanting Case Postponed to Today; Advance Notices Written Incorrectly; High Court Was Once Tense Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Wen Lanting case was originally scheduled to be heard in the special criminal court inside the Shanghai Prison by the High Court yesterday afternoon. Those who went to the hearing out of "reputation" made the court impossible to stand.

<h3>Wu Kaisheng Still in the Pose of a Lawyer; Completely Forgetting that He is a Criminal; Holding Law Books, Towels, and Small Fans; Mouth Full of "Defendant So-and-so"</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Wu Kaisheng, the false Vice Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and false Ambassador to Italy, was interrogated by the High Court yesterday. When Wu rebel proposed the case, he was calm and composed, holding a pocket-sized Six Laws Compendium, briefs, towels, and a small fan, just like a lawyer appearing in court. Moreover, when he testified in court, he repeatedly mentioned "Defendant So-and-so," as if he had forgotten that the defendant was himself. The case was originally scheduled to open the debate hearing yesterday, but later, because the defendant had submitted more evidence, the court still needed to investigate, so the debate was postponed to another hearing.</p>
<h3>Xiao Jianqing and Others Proposed Yesterday: Zhou Genyao's Case Has Been Prosecuted</h3>
<p>Xiao Jianqing, a native of Zhongshan, Guangdong, is currently 38 years old. During the period of enemy and puppet regimes, he successively served as the chief editor of the puppet *Zhonghua Daily* pictorial, editor of the *Youth Pictorial* run by the puppet Propaganda Department, director-general of the Propaganda Section of the Shanghai Special City Party Department of the puppet Kuomintang, and director of the Shanghai office of the puppet Chongming Special District Public Office. He engaged in distorted propaganda for the enemy and puppet regimes. His younger brother, Xiao Langping, served as assistant editor of the puppet *Youth Pictorial*, and Yang Zhenyuan and Cui Zhongtai were reporters for the same publication. In addition, Xu Teng, the captain of the Hongkou puppet Navy Baojia Youth Corps, and Wang Peiqin, the squad leader, assisted the enemy and puppet regimes in suppressing our anti-Japanese elements. The above-mentioned individuals have been jointly prosecuted by the High Procuratorate. The trial opened at the High Court yesterday afternoon. The defendants' statements were evasive and deceptive. After questioning by the court, the judge ordered the case to be adjourned for further hearing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Ling Guangyan, who served as a puppet major general brigade commander and other puppet positions for as long as six years, was previously sentenced to twelve years in prison by the High Court. Now the Supreme Court has remanded the case for a retrial. The court hearing was held yesterday afternoon.

<p>[Further Report] The High Procuratorate has prosecuted one case of suspected traitor Zhou Genyao. In addition, Xu Yuexian was found to have insufficient evidence of guilt and will not be prosecuted.</p>
<p>Zhu Boquan, Former President of Shanghai University</p>
<p>Zhu Boquan, currently 48 years old, is a native of Guizhou Gui Zhu. He studied at New York University and Columbia University in the United States. He successively served as deputy manager of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, manager of the Foreign Exchange Department, chief auditor of the Central Bank, and general manager of the Business Bureau. When the Pacific War broke out, the enemy and puppet regimes occupied the Shanghai concessions and took over the China Industrial Bank, with Zhu serving as chairman of the board. At the same time, he also served as manager of the Silver and Money Industry Joint Reserve, presided over the clearing house, and promoted puppet currency. He also served as a counselor for the puppet Central Reserve Bank, a supervisor of the puppet Central Reserve, and chairman of the Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association. In addition, he held dozens of positions as director and council member in various banks, companies, factories, and firms. Later, he resigned from his position as president of Shanghai University. He was seemingly a prominent figure in the Shanghai financial and industrial circles during the enemy and puppet period. After the victory, he was arrested and tried at the High Court yesterday morning. Zhu was dressed in a white cotton short shirt and trousers, and black shoes. He argued that when the Pacific War broke out, the Japanese army occupied the concessions, and British and American banks were closed. The deposits of Chinese people, including the defendant, were also frozen. Later, through negotiations between the defendant and Zhou Fohai, Qian Daqun, and others with Ke Yuan, the representative of the Ministry of Finance of the enemy stationed in Shanghai, the funds were unfrozen. In order to clarify the case, the court specially summoned Qian Daqun, the former vice president of the puppet Central Reserve Bank, from prison for questioning. Qian testified that this was indeed the case. The case was adjourned for further hearing.</p>

<h3>The National Merchant Shipping Bureau Adjusts North and South Ocean Shipping Routes: The Shipping Department Assigns Ships to Each Route</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] More than a year has passed since the victory, but land and water transportation has still not recovered. The main reason for this is undoubtedly the heavy burden of military and public transportation, which has hindered commercial transportation. Since its resumption of business, the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been striving to maintain shipping routes, but due to busy dispatching, all plans have not been implemented. Recently, the Shipping Department of the Bureau has reallocated ships to the northern and southern routes. The ships assigned to each route are listed below: South Ocean Route: Hanmin, Yan[something], Zhongkai, and Peiwei will sail, with Guangzhou as the final destination. Shanghai-Fuzhou Route: Deng Keng and Lin Sen will sail. North Ocean Route: Zhixin, Qimei, and Huangxing will sail, with Tianjin as the final destination. The North Ocean Route has been further divided into the Shanghai-Qingdao-Dalian route, and the Shanghai-Qingdao-Tianjin route. Haiji will sail the Qingdao-Dalian route, and Haisu will sail the Qingdao-Tianjin route. In addition, the Shanghai-Taiwan route will be served by Hai Zhe, Hai Kang, and Hai Qian. Cai E, Hai Gan, Hai E, Hai Dian, Hai Chuan, and Hai Gui will be dispatched as irregular flights to assist in transportation. The Bureau has assigned one ship to each of its Xiamen, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong branch offices for the convenience of commercial transportation. The ships have also been designated: Hai Wan will be assigned to the Xiamen branch office, Hai Yue will be transferred to the Guangzhou branch office, and Hai Min will be handed over to the Hong Kong branch office. According to the Shipping Department of the Bureau, if there are no obstacles to military and public transportation, and the above-mentioned plan is implemented in earnest, each terminal will be able to operate smoothly.</p>
<p>The People's Steamer Sails to Shanghai and Taiwan</p>
<p>The Minsheng Company's People's Steamer, with a total tonnage of over 4,000 tons, was originally a customs patrol ship.

<h3>Few Docks, Many Ships: The Public Works Bureau Convenes Shipping Industry to Discuss Solutions to Mooring Problems</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Public Works Bureau, in order to seek a solution to the problem of ship mooring, convened a group meeting of shipping industry representatives at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. Li Zhiyi of Ning Shao Company, Yu Shunwei of Sanbei Company, Li Yunliang of Dada Company, Lu Ziyang of Ping'an Company, and more than a dozen shipping industry representatives attended. Before the war, the number of docks was [damaged] significantly. Therefore, since the victory, the number of docks has decreased, and the number of ships has increased, which has had a significant impact on passenger and freight transportation. Moreover, because the arrival time of ships is uncertain, it is impossible to designate inner and outer berths in advance, which has caused a lot of disputes. Regarding the solution, after discussion yesterday, it was considered that the problem was complicated and needed to be studied in detail. It was decided that the shipping industry would draft written solutions and then submit them to the Public Works Bureau for review and approval.</p>

<h3>No Wonder Theft is Rampant at the Docks: The Culprit is a Patrolman from the Port Police Station</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yu Guoshou, patrolman No. 495 of the Jianghai Customs Port Police Station, and Cao Jiazhang, patrolman No. 216, colluded with Zhang Xuelei, also known as Zhang Wu Kouzi, a foreman, Zhong Haiqing, a carpenter, Yin Cai Tong, a laborer, and Liu Chengwen, Liu Bao, Zhu San Chengzi, Wang Caohe and other thieves who are on the run. At 10:00 AM on the 11th of this month, on the American ship (Norpel ship) between the sixteenth and seventeenth pontoons in the Huangpu River, they stole six bundles of various wool fabrics (73 yards per bundle) from the second cabin in the front, transferred them into boxes of car parts, waited for the wooden boxes to be lifted out, placed them on a barge, transported them ashore, and sold them. The matter was reported to the water police station by a secret informant. Wu Kexiao, the branch director, ordered Sun Fang, the chief of the criminal section, Sun Shiwang, a staff member of the foreign affairs section, and many police officers to rush to the scene.

<h3>The Case of the American Pilot Killed in Hong Kong: A Fierce Debate Unfolds in Military Court; The Prosecutor Constantly Asks Sharp Questions; The Court Twice Retires to Confer</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] A fierce debate unfolded in the American military court yesterday morning in the case of the murder of Major Hook. The chief prosecutor, Major Dewey, constantly asked sharp questions to Captain Yamaguchi Kyoichi, the defendant acting as a witness, refuting Yamaguchi's claim that the trial of Hook was "fair." Dewey pointed out that Yamaguchi had already read the reports from the military police and the military before the trial began and was deeply convinced of them, so he already had a preconceived notion that Hook was guilty. Yamaguchi, having testified for eight hours over the past two days, was clearly exhausted and his face was very pale. When answering the prosecutor's questions, he mostly avoided the substance. The prosecutor then asked the court to order Yamaguchi to answer "yes" or "no." At this time, the defendant's defense stood up to object, arguing that this was no different from asking someone: "Have you stopped beating your wife?" Because whether the answer is yes or no would be unfavorable. The chief defense counsel, Lieutenant Colonel Bolding, also pointed out that the prosecutor's question was "wasting time" and was "cunning and malicious." Mr. Dewey also retorted with sarcasm. The court retired twice to discuss the debate between the two sides, and finally neither side was favored. The requests of both sides were granted, and Yamaguchi was ordered to testify about the manifestation of so-called "fairness" and whether the verdict was based solely on the military's report. Finally, Yamaguchi admitted that when the decision was made by the collegial panel, since the other judges all thought Hook was guilty, he really had no right to acquit him.</p>
<h3>UNRRA China Director-General Eggerton Arrives in Shanghai in the Coming Days</h3>

<h3>Relief Supplies</h3>
<p>Transportation ships come to China in a continuous stream</p>
<p>UNRRA announced that as of this week, UNRRA has shipped a total of 893,765 tons of materials to China. Recently, 19 transport ships have come to China, 17 of which have arrived in Shanghai to unload. There are still 56 ships on their way to China, carrying a total of 165,600 tons of cargo.</p>
<h3>Rong Hongyuan, Age Thirteen: Accused of Embezzlement, Details Unknown, Retrial</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Rong Er'er, son of Rong Desheng, and his nephew Rong Hongyuan (son of Rong Zongjing), are being sued by their in-law Ding Ziren for embezzlement. The plaintiff requested Rong Desheng to be summoned at the retrial in the Criminal Court 4 of the local court yesterday morning. Rong Er'ren is currently in the United States, and only Rong Hongyuan attended the court to be questioned. Ding stated to the court that in 1919, he and Rong Desheng and Rong Zongjing jointly took over the Hengchangyuan Yarn Factory on Yichang Road and renamed it the Shenxin No. 2 Factory. At that time, the total capital was 500,000 yuan, with the Rong brothers contributing 200,000 yuan each and himself contributing 100,000 yuan. He also served as the general manager. Later, due to old age and weakness, he handed over the position of general manager to Rong Hongyuan, and Rong Er'ren served as the factory affairs manager. After they took over, they gradually embezzled his share capital and hid the original capital account books. He then presented the Shenxin No. 2 Factory's monthly report and year-end ledger as evidence. Zhang Lichuan, the accountant of the factory in 1919, and Zhu Xianfang, the factory director in 1927, testified that Ding did indeed own one-fifth of the share capital on the capital book. Rong Hongyuan said in response: "In 1919, I was only thirteen years old, so I did not know the details at that time. Later, because the factory suffered heavy losses, it was mortgaged to others. After it was recovered, I took over as general manager, but I did not know that Ding had shares in it. If he does have shares, he should be given his share." The court believed that it would be better to settle the case through reconciliation, so it advised the parties to try to reconcile out of court. Since the establishment of criminal liability must first be based on a lawsuit to confirm the equity in the civil court, the court announced that the trial would be suspended and the plaintiff would first file a lawsuit in the civil court. The embezzlement part will not be processed for the time being.</p>

<h3>A Brutal Parricide: A Horrific Matricide Occurs in Miaohang</h3>
<p>A horrific matricide occurred suddenly in Miaohang Town, Jiangwan. Just two weeks after the first "August 8th" Father's Day, when people with social conscience are actively promoting the restoration of filial piety, the sudden news of this great moral catastrophe causes concern that the social atmosphere is deteriorating and beyond saving. Liu Jinqian, 27, lives in Room 70 of the Memorial Village public housing in Miaohang. His mother, Liu Tangshi, is 60 years old. His younger brother, Yinqian, and he are both married and have separated. The family only has two or three mu of thin land. The younger brother is diligent and works in the rice industry. His mother also relies on him for support. The elder brother, Jinqian, is usually idle and does not engage in proper work. His mother loves her son deeply and still lives with her eldest son, working in the fields all day long, taking care of household affairs, and helping him solve the problem of food and clothing. Unexpectedly, not only did this fail to encourage her son to wake up, but she was often abused. The sound of her son beating and scolding his mother spread throughout the village and was despised by the neighbors long ago. At 8:00 PM on the 21st, Liu Tangshi returned from drawing water in the fields. Jinqian also returned at the same time and asked if she was going to take a bath. This angered her son, who shouted and scolded her loudly, followed by slapping her cheeks repeatedly. Liu Tangshi cried out for help in extreme pain. Jinqian then picked up a stool and smashed it at her, hitting her vital points repeatedly. She died of her injuries on the spot. The Tangjiaqiao outpost was notified and dispatched police to rush to the scene. The brutal parricide was arrested. He is now being sent to the Jiangwan Branch Bureau and transferred to the Dachang Branch Bureau for interrogation. He will soon be transferred to the court for interrogation.</p>

<h3>New President of National Yingshi University, Yang Gongda, Arrives in Hangzhou</h3>
<h3>To Go to Jinhua to Inspect New School Buildings</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Hangzhou] The new president of National Yingshi University, Yang Gongda, arrived in Hangzhou on the 19th from Beijing to oversee the university's repatriation. He is scheduled to go to Jinhua on the 23rd to inspect the new school buildings and plans to return to Beijing in early September to seek instructions from the Ministry of Education and discuss important matters within the school. President Yang told our reporter that he has been teaching for 18 years, but his appointment to Yingshi University was made hastily and his understanding of the university is not deep. However, he will ensure that the teachers and students of Yingshi University strive to preserve the spirit of Yingshi University, always emulate Mr. Chen Yingshi's great benevolence, wisdom, and courage, and always maintain their spirit of youth, becoming insightful scholars with foresight. He also hopes to manage school affairs with the spirit of the rule of law and in a democratic manner. Yingshi University currently has four colleges: liberal arts, science, agriculture, law, and commerce. A part of the university remains in Yongjia, and another part is in the process of repatriation. Only one-third of the school buildings in Jinhua are currently available, which can only accommodate two colleges at most. Therefore, inspecting the houses is the most important task. Since the Ministry of Education has ordered Yingshi University to be permanently established in Jinhua, it should have a permanent and more magnificent school building. The site has over a thousand acres of land, and the school buildings were designed by engineer Zeng Shande. If funding is available, it will soon become the greatest institution of higher learning in the southeastern region. President Yang studied in France and plans to exchange professors with France in the future and add music and art courses to cultivate students' character.</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Basketball Boom: Gathering of Heroes from North and South, Capital Air Force Team Arrives in Shanghai on the 26th, Tianjin Huasheng Team to Go South Soon, Philippine Chinese Overseas Qunsheng Team Departs Xiamen for the North</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Nanjing Air Force basketball team is on an expedition to Shanghai. It left Beijing for Wuxi on the other day (21st), where it faced off against the Liangxi team. It will go to Suzhou on the 24th for another game and is expected to arrive in this city on the 26th. After resting in Shanghai for one night, it will go to Hangzhou and then return to Shanghai on September 2nd to compete with the local strong teams in about three or four games. In addition to expressing welcome, the Basketball Committee has also invited the Hualian, Shantou, Dongfang, and Renyu teams to compete against them. It is also known that the Philippine Qunsheng and Tianjin Huasheng teams will also come to Shanghai. Therefore, the Air Force team can also compete with them at that time. It is expected that basketball giants from all over the country will gather in Shanghai, and there will be an unprecedented boom. The Air Force basketball team lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Air Force Lineup: General leader Yi Guorui, instructor and manager Wen Zongyuan, instructor Yang Hanchen, general secretary Yang Shaohua, captain Qu Xingcun, players Liu Zhenyuan, Ge Ke, Zhang Lizhi, Li Xianyue, Su Yinghai, Qin Xunze, Yao Zehua, Wang Helin, Leng Peishu.</p>
<p>Huasheng Coming to Shanghai: The Tianjin Huasheng basketball team has sent a letter to the local Basketball Committee, stating that they plan to come to Shanghai soon. The purpose is also to have an opportunity to observe the Philippine Qunsheng team. The Philippine Qunsheng team has left Xiamen and will arrive in Shanghai in the coming days. According to the above news, at that time, the confrontation between the Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Qunsheng teams will be no different from the situation in the finals of the National Games of that year. A boom and an improvement in the level of basketball are expected.</p>
<h3>Selection of Stars</h3>
<p>Furthermore, the list of Shanghai star basketball players who will go to the United States for observation has not yet been announced because there are various relationships involved. It is understood that it has been internally decided and approved by the Basketball Committee and the Executive Committee of the Sports Association. However, in accordance with the original intention of the 3198 team, the final list must be satisfactory to the team authorities before it can be announced. Initially, 3198 sent a letter to Qian Xucang, chairman of the Basketball Committee, with three conditions: (1) The number of team members is limited to seven (it may be increased to eight now), (2) They must be first-class players (the US military is familiar with the skills of the players of each team after participating in the league), (3) After the list is selected, it must be approved by 3198. Therefore, because of the above three reasons, Qian Xucang has spent a lot of effort, but with Qian's straightforwardness, impartiality, and selfless heart, he will surely be able to satisfy everyone.</p>

<h3>Brief News from the Civil Affairs Department: First District Strengthens Water Conservancy and Security, Convenes All Security Chiefs to Decide on Important Tasks</h3>
<p>The First District Office of this city, in order to speed up and promote the work of various water conservancy and security organizations, convened all water conservancy and security chiefs at the district office at 3:00 PM on the 21st of this month to discuss the matter. First, each security chief presented the difficulties in their work, and then they discussed various issues. It has been learned that the following items have been decided: (1) To complete the work of water conservancy and security organizations as soon as possible, please have the Water Police Branch effectively assist in order to achieve great results. The methods are: 1. The District Office sends a letter to the Water Police Bureau and consults with the person in charge of household registration to agree on assistance methods. 2. Each security organization should quickly report to the District Office any households or personnel who refuse to report household registration, so that they can be dealt with. 3. Send a letter to the Water Conservancy and Security Inspection Office of the Garrison Headquarters for assistance. (2) Boat households that have reported household registration should prepare household flags to indicate that they have been cleared and to facilitate passage. The methods are: 1. Stipulate the style and material of the household flag, the length of the main bamboo pole, and where it is inserted on the boat. 2. Order all security organizations and households to prepare them themselves or take the initiative to coordinate the handling. 3. The deadline for handling is the end of September. Starting in October, boat households must pass through with a county flag, otherwise they will not be allowed to pass. This does not apply to newcomers who report household registration. 4. Publish an announcement in the newspaper to inform everyone. (3) The deadline for all security organizations to complete the household registration work is September 5th. (4) The address of each security organization's office should be determined as soon as possible to facilitate office work.

<h3>After Tax Exemption and Devaluation, Export Goods Mostly Increase in Price: Tung Oil and Pig Bristles Can Barely Be Marketed, Sheepskin, Sausage Casings, and Eggs Cannot Be Exported</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Yesterday, several exporters told reporters that the biggest beneficiaries of the government's exchange rate adjustment are farmers who produce export goods and merchants who hold goods. Most exporters are intermediaries and cannot directly benefit. However, they hope that after the exchange rate increase, the price of Chinese exports can gradually become cheaper, making it easier for exporters to operate their businesses. However, judging from the recent prices of major export goods such as tung oil and pig bristles, their prices have increased by several percent compared to before the exchange rate adjustment. For tung oil, the market price before the exchange rate adjustment was about 70,000 yuan per dan. In the past two days, the asking price has reached 110,000 to 120,000 yuan per dan. Currently, the market price of tung oil in the United States is about US$0.36 per pound, which roughly equals 100,000 yuan per dan in the Chinese market. Argentina and other regions in South America also produce tung oil. The quality is lower, and the quantity is not large, but the asking price is only US$0.21 per pound. The United States itself also produces substitutes for tung oil. Therefore, if the market price of Chinese tung oil continues to rise, it will inevitably lose its market in the United States. It is hoped that Chinese tung oil merchants will be vigilant. As for pig bristles, the market price before the exchange rate adjustment was about 350,000 yuan per dan. In the past two days, it has risen to 550,000 yuan per dan. The market price of pig bristles in the United States was as high as US$3.50 per pound four months ago due to shortages and high prices. Recently, it has fallen to US$2.00 per pound, which is equivalent to about 600,000 yuan per dan in the Chinese market. Therefore, in the current situation, the export of tung oil and pig bristles should not encounter difficulties due to excessive prices. Sheepskin was about 160,000 yuan per dan before the exchange rate adjustment, but has recently risen to 250,000 yuan per dan. There is a widespread shortage of cow and sheep skins in the world, and the United States is offering US$0.80 per pound for sheepskin. However, calculated at the domestic market price of 250,000 yuan per dan, the cost is about US$1.01 per pound. Therefore, the export of sheepskin is already difficult. As for sausage casings, exports are impossible because domestic prices are too high, and the quality lacks standards. Egg exports have also decreased sharply in China after the war. The supply is insufficient for domestic demand, and prices are high. Under the universal food price limit system abroad, it is fundamentally impossible to export eggs. It is said that since the exchange rate adjustment, merchants holding export goods have increased the prices of various export goods according to the ratio of the increased exchange rate and the amount of export tax exemption. It is hoped that the price increase will be limited and will not affect the original export prices. Recently, importers have been quite hesitant and have been calling for lower prices. It is currently heard that Chinese exporters are planning to jointly maintain</p>

<p>Huai River Journey</p>
<p>This Newspaper’s Dispatch from Linhuai Pass on the 17th. Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi.</p>
<p>[From ancient times, securing the Yangzte River has always required securing the Huai River first.] – Ye Shi</p>
<p>From nature to society, the current Huai River shows no sign of being secure. Flooding is everywhere, and the disaster is severe. Highway transportation is cut off, and at least five million people are trapped in the water, unable to move. The Huai River’s own water would not have caused a disaster, but with the addition of the Yellow River’s water, it has become like the situation in the 20th year of the Republic (1931).</p>
<p>The blocking of the Huayuankou breach was not completed, and on July 22nd, with a loud bang, the breach was widened, and the Yellow River’s water came like the Jia Lu River, passing through Yingchuan and rushing into the Huai River. According to measurements by the Yellow River Engineering Bureau, the flow rate is 8,000 cubic meters per second. The Huai River’s maximum flow rate is 15,000, and its own flow rate this year is close to 7,000, which perfectly adds up to the full amount, restoring the record of the 20th year of the Republic (1931). However, in the past fifteen years, the riverbed has accumulated a lot of silt, increasing the flow rate and creating new record water levels.</p>
<p>In the 20th year of the Republic (1931), the Huai River’s highest water level was 20.17 meters, which was from the Huai River’s own water. If it is the same this year, plus the Yellow River’s water, then Shen Ke Bi (a phrase implying “it’s all over”), and the disaster situation will be unimaginable.</p>
<p>Raging Floodwaters</p>
<p>The reporter was ordered to take a trip to the Huai River region. Looking around, raging floodwaters were everywhere, with broad and expansive waves. Added to the sounds of gunfire, I recalled Du Fu’s line, “Blood stains the rivers and plains red.” Pain filled my chest, and I could not restrain myself. A vast expanse of white, shimmering with ochre-yellow, revealed a few clusters of rooftops, some fields of sorghum, or sparsely scattered soybean leaves, swaying in the waves, as if saying something. This is the scenery that can be seen everywhere.</p>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Government has an engineering organization for seizing the Huai River embankments, humorously named the “Yellow River Prevention Office.” The Huai River Guidance Committee, having returned from Sichuan, took the first action regarding the Huai River, which was to restore the embankments, establishing the “Embankment Restoration Engineering Bureau.” It will repair 1,080 kilometers of Huai River embankments, pile up over 14 million cubic meters of earth, and raise the embankment body to one meter above the flood level, planning to complete the work by the end of this year. It requested 27,000 tons of flour from the Executive Headquarters for work relief. However, since May, more than 3,000 tons have already been used to cooperate with the Yellow River Prevention Office for emergency relief and repair of breaches. It is feared that 27,000 tons of flour will not be enough by the time the plan is completed. Before repairs are made, breaches occur, leading to being caught off guard.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, with heavy rain pouring down, I saw Bureau Chief Yin Chengzhi in Bengbu. He looked at the sky, his face filled with dark clouds, and said, “With this rain, the water level will break records. Today it is 20.15 meters.” By evening, it had indeed risen to 20.18 meters. He said, “If there were no Yellow River water, the Huai River water level would be at least two meters lower, and there would be no problem.”</p>
<p>The Yellow River Prevention Office uses forced labor, just like the Embankment Restoration Bureau, and they are extremely busy. Working in this area, I secretly pondered that the news of such a large-scale disaster is still being ignored or even unknown, which is undoubtedly because the news of peace talks and fighting has overshadowed it!</p>
<p>Silent Disaster Area</p>
<p>After a disaster, the second topic is naturally disaster relief. Such articles and topics are endless in China. However, this large-scale flood has not yet attracted attention from all parties. The tragic ending will eventually be a tragedy. Traffic in the disaster area is blocked, and millions of people are trapped in the water, almost silently. They maintain silence, as if isolated from the outside world. The Anhui Provincial Party and Government Restoration Supervision Group is now becoming a disaster investigation group, but it cannot collect numerical data for the time being. Is this paralysis of the political machinery or a satire thrown in by reality?</p>
<p>Liu Zhenru, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Nationalist Party, went to Nanjing for this matter to appeal to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Central Party Headquarters, and the Executive Headquarters. Anhui’s local newspapers concernedly published his news, saying, “It has already aroused the attention of people from all walks of life to the disaster situation in northeastern Anhui, and the future is quite optimistic.”</p>
<p>Because the water level of the Huai River is high, the water from the tributaries cannot be discharged, so it overflows. As of now, the disaster situation is extremely serious, with no signs of optimism. The most severely affected areas in northeastern Anhui include Yingshang, Fuyang, Taihe, Linquan, Fengtai, Huaiyuan, Suxian, Lingbi, Dingyuan, Jiashan, Xuyi, Tianchang, Lai’an, Wuhe, Sixian, Fengyang, Mengcheng, and Guoyang. The disaster area is estimated to be no less than 50,000 square kilometers!</p>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Government, the Party Headquarters, and the Provincial Assembly jointly handled three matters: First, requesting work relief and emergency relief from the Relief Branch; Second, requesting the Executive Yuan to exempt agricultural taxes; Third, requesting that the restoration funds be increased from 100 million yuan to 1 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Everyone must know that among the counties listed above, in addition to floods, there are also those that have suffered from war. Not only that, but some counties also have locust plagues this year. Super restoration work is needed. Regarding the harvest, I asked people familiar with Anhui, and they said that there would always be 10% to 20% of a harvest, “Each county has some mountainous areas.” This is the reason.</p>
<p>When the Communist troops retreated from Wuhe, somehow, the embankments of the Hui River suddenly collapsed, so coincidentally. Now Wuhe County is submerged in water, and the roads are impassable. The exiled county government is located in the Zhangjia Building in Linhuai Pass. Although the National Army has entered, County Magistrate Zhang Xian has been slow to go. Some of the gentlemen who escaped were killed somehow at night because they returned too early. Therefore, safety issues were given great consideration, and a nominal county magistrate naturally had his considerations. However, the people of Wuhe rushed to Linhuai Pass, pasting slogans around the Zhangjia Building, pushing people to request an audience, and respectfully welcoming the county magistrate to return to the county. Only on the 14th did a boat go to Wuhe for “restoration.”</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Xu Qiming, Chief of Staff of Xia Wei, advised me not to go to Wuhe, “Wait half a month or twenty days.”</p>

<p>The Battle of Sixian</p>
<p>The ancients often compared the Huai and Si Rivers, saying, “Those who wish to control the Central Plains must obtain the Huai and Si Rivers.” In reality, this refers to the two Huai areas. The five counties in eastern Anhui are now entirely under the control of the National Army, while eleven counties in northern Jiangsu are still in the hands of the Communist troops. “Securing the Yangzte River first requires securing the Huai River.” The war in northern Jiangsu is actually a struggle for the Huai River region. The threat to Nanjing is a common theme, and the propaganda rhetoric is comparable. If the Huai and Si Rivers move, the situation in the Central Plains will be dangerous, and the overall situation will change. The impact is not to be taken lightly.</p>
<p>Currently, the eastern Anhui region is mostly submerged in water. The National Army in this area is mostly composed of soldiers from Guangxi, wading through the swampy countryside and advancing eastward. The reporter once hesitated on the road to Wuhe. The Communist troops, with a force of 30,000, launched a fierce attack on Sixian starting on the evening of the 7th. The attack was sudden and fierce. The battle ended on the 10th, and the Communist troops retreated. When I returned to Bengbu, I met Lieutenant General Xu Qiming, Chief of Staff of General Xia Wei, on the way. I then learned the details of the battle of Sixian.</p>
<p>Among the Communist troops attacking Sixian, there were three regiments of the Eighth Division of the Eighth Route Army and three regiments of the Seventh Division, all newly transferred from the eastern section of the Longhai Railway in southern Shandong. There were also four regiments of the Second Division of the New Fourth Army, three independent regiments of the Seventh Military District, and the entire Ninth Column. In addition, there were over 10,000 puppet troops from Hao Pengju’s Huaibei forces, without a doubt. The total force was 30,000.</p>
<p>Using such a large force to attack a small city shows that it was a major battle. Here, I would particularly like to talk about Hao Pengju. Isn’t the Communist army always strongly opposed to the government’s incorporation of puppet troops? Why did they now unite with the puppet troops to attack Sixian? Or did the puppet troops unite with the Communist army to attack Sixian? Answers to these questions were obtained from familiar sources:</p>
<p>(1) It is indeed true that the Communist army has taken in and incorporated Hao Pengju, and commanded him. The puppet troops participating in the attack on Sixian this time were part of Hao Pengju’s puppet army. (2) At the beginning of the Japanese surrender, Chairman Chiang ordered the puppet troops to maintain local order in their original stationed areas and await orders. Hao Pengju, then serving as the puppet governor of Huaibei Province, transformed himself into the National Army and held a large-scale “takeover” in Xuzhou, sweeping up everything. When the 32nd Group Army of the National Army advanced into Xuzhou, Xuzhou had become an empty city. The authorities designated Hao Pengju’s troops to temporarily station in the Caocun area on the Jinpu Railway line and await reorganization orders. The Communist army then used force or political means to persuade Hao Pengju to “disarm.” In March of this year, the government ordered the downsizing of troops across the country, so Hao Pengju surrendered to the Communist army with his men and guns, without needing to downsize.</p>
<p>The National Army defending Sixian had only six battalions, less than two regiments. Thirty thousand Communist troops attacked fiercely, and on the evening of August 7th, they were suddenly broken into. At the destroyed breaches in the city walls of the Great and Small North Gates, Communist troops broke in, with two regiments’ worth of personnel. Sixian had been built into an independent stronghold-style fortification. After a fierce battle overnight, by daybreak, the invading Communist troops were annihilated. On the evening of the 8th, they attacked the Southeast Gate again and were repelled again. At dawn on the 9th, they attacked again and were again broken into the Great North Gate, leading to street fighting and contention for residences, lasting until the evening, when they were again driven out. On the morning of the 10th, the Communist troops retreated completely.</p>
<p>According to reports, there were 3,000 corpses left inside the North Gate of Sixian City and in the suburbs. In total, the casualties will reach 10,000. The National Army suffered a total of 35 officer casualties and 951 soldier casualties.</p>
<p>“Piles of corpses make the grass and trees stink.” Sixian was defended, but it was also destroyed. Looking up at the sorrowful clouds and mourning the heroic souls from afar, this place is war!</p>
<p>Winds and Rains in Linhuai Pass</p>
<p>Taking the Jinpu Railway into the plain south of the Huai River, one can gradually see the scenery of carrying guns while herding cattle. As the autumn wind rises, ten thousand feet of dark clouds surge past, and raindrops pound the train windows. Very few people are taking the express train north, and the train is unusually desolate. Looking out at the surrounding fields, it seems as if one is in the Ze Township, and this is especially true in Linhuai Pass.</p>
<p>With the break in the western section of the Longhai Railway, the operating income of the Jinpu Railway has become even more dismal. A deputy stationmaster earns only a little over 100,000 yuan, which is only enough to buy two loads of rice. The headquarters are in Jinan, and the Jiaoji Railway is being repaired. Both places have no income at all and need to take money from the Puxu and Jinde sections. Every month, income falls short of expenditure. The Puxu section suffered two destructive offensives from the Communist army in October and December last year. Railway engineers worked desperately to repair and restore traffic for emergency purposes. Many bridges are in critical condition and have not been resolved. With the flood season approaching, there were plans to completely repair the bridges from March to May to make them permanent and avoid being affected by the floodwaters. In theory, the production capacity of the Puzhen Vehicle Factory could produce all the planned beam materials and rivets within a month, but the area north of Xuzhou also needed to be repaired and needed to supply fishplates, screws, and spikes, so the flood prevention plan failed. As of now, only one-third of the bridges planned for repair have been completed. Thanks to heaven (as the engineers see it), the bridges in critical condition have not had any accidents under careful protection. When the train approaches a bridge, there is a large red paint board next to the road, with the four white characters "Stop and then go" written on it. The white characters have peeled off, but the board is still red. The driver still stops and then goes, driving the vehicle slowly, as if stealthily feeling their way across. It really requires a great deal of careful patience.</p>
<p>Chronicle of the Sanchong Gully</p>
<p>Linhuai Pass belongs to Fengyang County. The county government is in Fengyang, but the police station is located in Linhuai Pass. The reason for this can be easily guessed. Half a month ago, the north bank of Linhuai Pass was still within the sphere of influence of the Communist army. The Communist army entered and exited from the villages of Hanjiatai, Guofuyao, Nanxinzhuang, Caofuqiao, and Huangbanzi. The designation was an independent regiment of the Seventh Military District. They dug trenches on the embankments on both sides of the Sanchong Gully. The Communist army occupied a gun emplacement on the north bank of the gully. In order to clear the line of fire, they leveled 200 meters of the embankment on the south bank (see attached photo). Although the residents of Hebei Town had some defenses, they did not treat it as a major enemy. The diagram only shows the relationship in this area. The people of Hebei Town said, "Once the Communist army really wants to enter Hebei Town, we can only let them in." They were on sentry duty in this area.</p>
<p>When the water level of the Huai River rose, the people in the Guofuyao area were jumping up and down in a hurry. They watched with their own eyes the dikes being built on the south bank of the river, but the Sanchong Gully had a 200-meter opening. Guo Hexian, the Bao Chief of Guofu Bao, said, "We contacted them, and they agreed to let us repair it, but only allowed 20 people to go every day, and only those from Guofu Bao. As a result, we didn't repair it."</p>
<p>An engineer from the Huai River Guidance Committee said, "There are more than 2,000 cubic meters of earth here. It would take 200 people ten days to complete it." This is a scientific calculation, which shows that using 20 people to seize the dike is equivalent to zero.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this month, the Communist army retreated because the water had already come. From a military point of view, the water has changed the importance of the Sanchong Gully, and there is no longer a need to hold onto this gun emplacement. The Huai River Guidance Committee only recently surveyed the dike from the Sanchong Gully to Hebei Town and began repairs, but the floodwaters broke through again on the 15th, and a triangular area across from Linhuai Pass is now a vast expanse of water. The Communist army once dug 200 meters of the embankment here, which was of no benefit to the local people. This is an ironclad fact. The people of Guofu Bao are all witnesses.</p>
<p>If the dike restoration project on the south bank cannot proceed like the Sanchong Gully and cannot be repaired, then the water situation in Linhuai Pass will definitely be even more unimaginable. Not even one engineer has gone to the Wuhe area yet. I said goodbye to the engineers. We looked at each other's skin and faces, all so black. We said goodbye to each other in the mud, wishing each other good health and safety.</p>
<p>As we approached Linhuai Pass, the car slowly crossed a bridge with a frame where the water was about to touch the outer steel beams, and then entered the station. At this time, the streets of Linhuai Pass were revealed before us. Almost the entire town of Linhuai Pass was submerged in water, and the roads were clogged with mud. This is still the situation after the dikes were repaired, otherwise it would be even more serious. Walking into the street, the water was knee-deep, but you could still take a rickshaw. If the water rose again, then there would be no other way but to rely on land boats. The terrain on the main street is higher, but even so, many houses on the edge of town have mostly collapsed into the water, with some still revealing a roof ridge, making people feel nostalgic. If the flood had washed away everything so that there was no trace left, then the meaning of the word "disaster" would be lost. Now, the disaster-stricken residents are crowding onto the main street, or building simple shacks on the embankment or in open spaces, dragging mud and water, with a foul odor in the air, and cries intertwined. Those who have been here for a long time may not notice the chaotic situation. I, who have just arrived, cannot help but be shocked. People are stubbornly holding onto this land ravaged by floods. What are they waiting for? And the people from Wuhe and other places are still hiding here, not daring to return home.</p>
<p>They ran around telling each other the news of the rising and falling water levels. The doors of most of the shops on the street were wide open, empty, with only smelly, turbid water swirling inside. These shops have mostly moved, but many small shops are still firmly guarding their spots, conducting business as usual. They have put everything up high, and their beds are below the water, and when they lie down, their backs are only a foot away from the water. They are cramped in between, waiting for customers.</p>
<p>I found several engineers from the Huai River Guidance Committee in the mud. They were working hard, fighting the water, and working extremely hard. During the War of Resistance, they measured the Shajiang River, repaired the Qijiang water diversion project, and developed water conservancy projects in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. After returning from restoration, they immediately encountered the Huai River flooding. We walked through the flooded streets in the wind and rain, inspecting the newly repaired dikes together. At the southern end of Linhuai Pass, they have rushed to repair a 5-kilometer-long embankment, providing work relief and using 300,000 cubic meters of earth. This embankment is not piled up with earth, but with flour! Each cubic meter of earth costs two catties of flour. If it is difficult to obtain earth or the road is far away, then it costs three or four catties per cubic meter. Two thousand people worked for two months to complete it. Many ships are crowded in Linhuai Pass because they cannot sail out, especially in Xinqiaowan. Along the 5-kilometer-long embankment, the masts are like a forest, extremely lively.</p>
<p>When will the water recede? There is no certainty at all. Linhuai Pass has been submerged in water for a month. I saw doctors carrying saline bottles and rubber tubes, wearing short clothes and wading into the water to see patients. - A terrible epidemic! (All photos are taken by special correspondent Shao Shenzhi.)</p>

<p>Seven Weeks</p>
<p>Xu Jiejun</p>
<p>Not long ago, I flew to Tokyo to testify at the Far East International Military Tribunal for the Trial of Japanese War Criminals and stayed there for seven weeks before returning to Shanghai. This gave me the opportunity to witness the post-war ruins of Tokyo and the post-war lives of ordinary people. I have compiled a random record for my compatriots to know some of the truths of the defeated countries, and there may be some things worth noting.</p>
<p>Post-war Tokyo is no longer what it used to be. About 70% to 80% of the buildings have been destroyed, especially in Yokohama, Osaka, and Kobe. Large and small factories have been razed to the ground. Only the destroyed chimneys remain, standing like reeds. Prosperous areas have been leveled. Ruined walls and broken walls are everywhere, leaving a desolate scene. Other cities, except for Kyoto and Nara, were also affected. Kyoto is a Japanese scenic spot, and Nara is a cultural area, so the Allied forces left one side of the net open during the bombing, preserving this glimmer of light. Even the locations of universities in the Tokyo area are still mostly intact. There are only minor scars near the Imperial Palace, showing a slight punishment and leaving room for reflection. Only the Ginza, Kanda, Asakusa, and Shibuya areas in the city are still lively. In other areas, there are few people, and the market is depressed. Tokyo citizens use empty spaces in the destroyed wasteland to plant vegetables, transforming the city into a farm. It is truly an overwhelming feeling of vicissitudes.</p>
<p>Tokyo originally had a population of more than 7 million, but now only half remain. There are many cars running in the city, mostly motorcycles from the United States. From the Imperial Palace to the various ministries, there is silence. The doors can be used to catch birds. The city, once known as the fifth largest city in the world, now has no large buildings left except for the empty streets, which are still a symbol. Only the magnificent and splendid Meiji Shrine stands tall, complete and unharmed. Inside the palace, the two walls are inlaid with eighty famous paintings, each more than ten feet long and wide, depicting the life of Meiji, from birth to burial, and the performance of various political achievements during the Meiji Restoration. The brushstrokes are vivid, and the painting methods also evolved with the times. The first half imitates the rendering of our country, and the second half imitates the oil painting of the West, showing the extreme beauty and vividness. What is especially striking is the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War. The state of showing off one's power abroad that day is vividly displayed on paper, and the scene of Li Hongzhang and Ito Hirobumi arguing on equal footing in the Shunpanro Pavilion in Shimonoseki is lifelike. Looking at it now, it has become a historical relic. If it is compared with the film of the war criminals being tried in court today, I don't know what they would think. Those who love war will surely be defeated, which is enough to be a warning.</p>
<p>The current living conditions of the Japanese people are what my compatriots want to know. Clothing is not considered very important by the Japanese. Although many houses have been bombed, people generally build small houses in the destroyed wasteland to avoid wind and rain. The most serious problem is food. Japan has always lacked food and relied on Vietnam, Indonesia, Taiwan, and other places for supplies. During the war, they relied on military force to arbitrarily seize from the occupied territories. I don't know how many stones of food our country transported back to the country every year, but now this source has been completely cut off. Food panic is inevitable. At present, each person is allocated only two gō and one shakyu of rice per day, which is not enough for one meal for a strong man. The Japanese government is still afraid that it will be difficult to continue. Cabinet discussions and newspaper appeals have the theme of profound reflection. Not only food, but also oil, salt, meat, vegetables, and even daily necessities such as cigarettes, matches, soap, and towels are all rationed, and there is almost nowhere to buy them in the market. Occasionally there is a black market, but the prices are high. Except for a few Chinese restaurants opened by overseas Chinese, most are small restaurants. What is displayed in the shops is all artificial silk, hand tools, children's toys, and books and textbooks. Applied items are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. The Allied forces transport all the staple and non-staple foods and Japanese items here themselves. However, the Japanese currency has not been highly inflated, and the ordinary price index is no more than a hundred times higher than before the war. Rationed items are all at flat prices, only about ten times higher. It is said that 300 yuan per month is enough for ordinary people to live on. Therefore, although materials are difficult to obtain, the social situation is still stable. The item of travel is even less of a problem. The Japanese manage the transportation industry very well. Trains run on time, and the time is very accurate. Streetcars run through the streets, and buses replace them where streetcars cannot reach. The roads are mostly wide asphalt roads. There are also those made of small stones, all neat and flat. Underground tunnels run horizontally and vertically, all connected by streetcars, and there are shops and markets. In the suburbs, there are elevated streetcars for connection. In addition, there are many bicycles, but what we call "Eastern cars" are almost extinct. Only a few dozen remain in the lively Ginza area as decorations for the Allied forces from the West. This is enough to show their saving of manpower. Although streetcars are also crowded, the order is quite good. You don't have to buy a cumulative amount when you get on the bus. Everyone pays for the supplement ticket when you get off the bus, and there are no omissions. Other public utilities such as telephones are widespread in the countryside, and although sanitation facilities have been destroyed, people are quite able to clean themselves to make up for the deficiency. Social Service</p>
<p>This newspaper and the Relief Hospital jointly organized the trachoma prevention campaign.</p>
<p>Free treatment for all middle school and college students and faculty in this city</p>
<p>Mr. Rao Jiaju, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Relief Hospital, and Dr. Wang Juerong, Director of the Hospital, have recently decided to jointly organize a "Trachoma Prevention Campaign" because trachoma is rampant among students in various schools in this city, accounting for more than 60% of the total. If prevention and treatment are not carried out early, it will inevitably affect health and cause great harm. The first session will be temporarily limited to middle school students and faculty, and 150 people will be diagnosed and treated first. The diagnosis and medication fees will be completely free. After the first session is cured, it will continue to be carried out to fulfill the duties of a citizen. At the same time, it is hoped that with the advocacy of our newspaper and the hospital, major hospitals in the city and across the country will rise up in response to prevent and treat trachoma, so that patients across the country can always see the light, which will be of great benefit to the country and society. The simplified rules are attached below:</p>
<p>Simplified Rules for the "Trachoma Prevention Campaign" jointly organized by the Social Service Department of Shen Bao and the Social Service Department of the Relief Hospital</p>
<p>(1) Eligibility: All middle school and college students or faculty members in this city who suffer from trachoma can apply for treatment.</p>
<p>(2) The free treatment is tentatively set for one to two months, and all expenses are free.</p>
<p>(3) The doctors are Dr. Sun Yuanming and Dr. Zhang Yiyong, ophthalmology experts specially invited by the Relief Hospital (formerly ophthalmology specialists at Guangci Hospital).</p>
<p>(4) Registration: Starting from August 25, students and faculty members who suffer from trachoma should first fill out an application form at the Social Service Department of this newspaper and take it to the Relief Hospital at 547 Xizang South Road for consultation. Answering Readers’ Questions Legal Enquiries (1) Arrest and Questioning Cai Bingfu asks: (1) Kuang Mingkai, a large local bully in Xinghua County, has been notorious for kidnapping and robbery. Later, he openly defected to the enemy and served as the head of a puppet regiment for five years, harming the local area for more than ten years, which he admits without denial. Do active military officers have the right to arrest him? (2) If the criminal is killed while being escorted because he tries to escape, is the person in charge committing a crime? (3) Is there any crime in escorting the criminal to the general depot without handing him over to the Pacification Headquarters? (4) Reading the newspaper about the Regulations for Punishing Traitors, it states that all puppet military officers above the rank of major will be punished according to the severity of their crimes. Does Kuang's crime apply to this regulation? (5) Can the pre-trial records, which were read out on the spot and approved by Kuang with his fingerprints, be valid? (6) The defendant, Fan Cheng, has eliminated a great scourge for the county, and the people are sincerely grateful. Now, driven by conscience, they plan to rescue him. How should they proceed? [Lawyer Fu Kuangling replies] (1) If it is as stated in the letter, the criminal's crimes are obvious, and there is nothing wrong with arresting him and sending him for punishment. (2) If the criminal escapes and cannot be caught, and is shot and killed, the officer in charge should be held administratively liable according to the law, and the escort soldier who carried out the shooting should be held liable for negligent homicide. (3) From a military perspective, it is appropriate to hand over the criminal to the general depot of the direct superior authority. (4) According to Article 302, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, it is considered illegal detention, but if the time limit is exceeded due to unavoidable circumstances, it can be waived after verification. (5) Since the criminal once served as the head of a puppet regiment, he is of the rank of colonel and is subject to punishment under the Regulations for Punishing Traitors. (6) Of course it is valid. (7) Reputable local gentry can jointly write to the handling authority, detailing the facts and proving that the defendant has eliminated a scourge for the local area and that there are extenuating circumstances, for the handling authority to refer to. (2) Malicious Abandonment Yu Wenjing asks: I am a timid woman. My husband is a rogue, a gambler, and a smoker. In the summer of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), the enemy invaded our hometown. He took this opportunity to force me to leave home by various criminal means of intimidation and abuse, otherwise, he would kill me. I had no choice but to be forced to return to my mother's home and suffer abandonment. Later, although I asked many people to reason with him, he always spoke unreasonably and did not get a concrete solution. He neither allows me to return home nor bears my living expenses, nor does he divorce me. For five years, I have been living a wandering and miserable life. Please ask: (1) Is this considered abandonment? What kind of procedures should I take to resort to law? (2) In this situation, can I unilaterally publish a divorce notice in the newspaper? Will it be legally valid? (3) After the divorce, who is responsible for the education, marriage, and matching of the children? If I do not go through the divorce procedure and remarry someone else, is it legal? (4) If I cohabit with someone and am sued by my original husband, will I and the person I cohabit with be subject to legal sanctions? [Lawyer Fu Kuangling replies] (1) It is undoubtedly malicious abandonment, which is a crime under the Criminal Law. (2) If the malicious acts are still continuing, you can petition the court for divorce, but it is not legally based for one party to publish a divorce notice in the newspaper. (3) After the divorce, the husband is legally responsible for the children's education, upbringing, and marriage, but if there is another agreement, follow the agreement. (4) Divorce procedures must be followed. (5) Before the divorce procedure is completed, the marital relationship still exists. If you cohabit with someone, you are committing a crime under Article 239 of the Criminal Law, punishable by imprisonment for up to one year, and the adulterer is also subject to the same punishment.</p>

<p>Hygiene and Medicine The Meaning and Importance of Mental Hygiene Xia Zhenyi</p>
<p>During cholera outbreaks, health authorities always conduct extensive epidemic prevention publicity, making the public deeply aware of the danger of cholera and the importance of prevention. There is also an annual anti-tuberculosis campaign, making people understand the harm that tuberculosis poses to national health and the urgency of eradication. I have often browsed through general school health textbooks, and cholera and tuberculosis occupy important positions, but we have neglected an even more formidable enemy to national health—mental illness. We know that the whole person consists of two aspects: physical and mental. We should pay attention to both physical hygiene and mental hygiene. We pay attention to physical health, and we must not neglect mental health. La Rue said, "Without mental health, only physical health is not considered true health."</p>
<p>Two Meanings</p>
<p>In today's turbulent world, people's everything has lost its guarantee, and they live in a state of high tension. The increasing number of mentally ill people and the seriousness of the problem are undeniable. The direct and indirect losses caused by mental illness every year are truly terrifying. Although there are no accurate statistics on mentally ill people in our country, it is not difficult to estimate the astonishing numbers and losses by comparing them with statistics from other countries. Take the United States as an example. According to a 1920 report by the American Medical Association, one in every 325 people in the country suffers from mental illness. According to a survey in New York, one in every 22 people in the state suffers from mental illness. There are a total of 430,800 patients in mental hospitals in the United States, and the number increases by 20,000 each year. According to 1926 statistics, the United States spends a total of 90 million gold dollars on mental hospitals each year. The loss of wages for patients in New York State alone reaches 14.3 million gold dollars. The moral and spiritual losses are even more alarming. On average one in 125 couples in the United States divorce due to mental illness. There are 500,000 crimes and 15,000 suicides nationwide each year, about half of which are caused by mental illness. By 1936, 1% of the U.S. population had symptoms of mental illness, and the number of mentally ill people had increased to 1.3 million, accounting for 47% of hospital beds nationwide. The maintenance cost of mental hospitals each year is 308.65 million gold dollars. Recently, President Truman stated in Congress: "At least 2 million people in the United States suffer from mental illness, and at least 10 million people will need to be treated for mental illness in hospitals at some point in their lives." If we combine all the above-mentioned losses, whether moral, economic, orderly, or career-related, we can see how serious the problem of mental illness has become. To solve this problem and avoid all kinds of incalculable losses, the promotion and advancement of mental hygiene is an urgent matter.</p>
<p>I know that most Chinese people do not have a deep understanding of mental hygiene, and even more people do not know what mental hygiene is all about. Mental hygiene uses scientific methods and artistic techniques to enable individuals to develop mentally in a healthy and natural way, so as to cultivate a sound personality. It has two meanings: The negative aspect is to prevent the occurrence of mental illness and improve the treatment of mentally ill people; the positive aspect is to promote mental health and cultivate a complete personality.</p>
<p>Misconceptions</p>
<p>The various aspects of mental illness prevention will be discussed in detail in another article. Correcting attitudes and concepts towards mentally ill people is also one of the important tasks in promoting mental hygiene in the future. Many people in society still cannot treat mentally ill people with the same sympathy as other physical illnesses. Society's attitude towards mentally ill people is still inevitably cold, honest, and discriminatory. They still superstitiously believe that mentally ill people are possessed by demons or punished by gods,</p>
<h3>Central Air Transport Corporation's Successful Endeavor: Profitable Sixty Billion in Seven Months Since Moving to Shanghai; Six Existing Routes, Expansion Planned to Foreign Countries</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] At Longhua Airport, there are currently two airlines, one is the "China" airline jointly operated by China and the United States, and the other is the "Central" airline purely operated by Chinese.</p>
<p>When we officially declared war on Germany four years ago, the Sino-German joint venture Eurasia Aviation Corporation was taken over and reorganized by the Ministry of Communications. At that time, all that existed were four Junkers Ju 52 transport aircraft, flying irregularly from Kunming to Guilin, Chongqing, Hong Kong and other places, as well as northwest Hami, Dihua, and Lanzhou. However, with the outbreak of the Pacific War, they were bombed and destroyed by the Japanese air force, leaving only one. This one had also exceeded its flight age.</p>
<p>At this time, in the Chinese commercial aviation industry, there were three or four veteran aviators who, in order to develop the urgently needed commercial aviation industry in China, agreed with the Ministry of Communications to form the "Central Air Transport Corporation." They obtained a Japanese "Type 97" bomber from the Aviation Committee and flew irregularly between Chengdu and various important cities, assisting the government in transporting goods. Later, they successively obtained three or four Lockheed light bombers. Although these were barely sufficient with the efforts of a few people, they were not suitable for commercial airliners.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1945, victory arrived, and the U.S. military left behind a large amount of surplus material in India. "Central" also purchased eleven U.S. military aircraft. The five young aviators of "Central" personally flew those aircraft from India across the Hiamlayas over the Hump, to Kunming. At that time, it was the beginning of the government's post-war recovery, and the lack of transportation created an unprecedented opportunity to develop commercial aviation. These five people took turns taking off every day, vigorously and enthusiastically cultivating this barren land of Chinese commercial aviation. Around Christmas last year, they moved from Kunming to Shanghai, occupying a place at Longhua Airport.</p>
<p>Their painstaking efforts finally did not disappoint them. Today, they own seventy airworthy passenger transport aircraft, with twenty in regular flight. There are also more than a hundred newly purchased U.S. military surplus aircraft currently parked at Jiangwan Airport undergoing refurbishment.</p>
<p>The number of flight personnel has increased to fourteen, and recruitment is still ongoing. By the end of this year, there will be more than twenty overseas Chinese pilots from the U.S. Air Force who, after retiring, will come to sign contracts and join. Twenty aviation personnel returning from training in the United States will also be hired.</p>
<p>Currently, there are a total of six major routes: Shanghai-Kunming, Shanghai-Chongqing, Shanghai-Peiping (Beijing), Shanghai-Hong Kong, and the recently opened Shanghai-Lanzhou and Shanghai-Xi'an routes. In the planning stages, they are also extending the South China route to Vietnam and Bangkok, and extending the Hong Kong route to the Philippines, to facilitate transportation between overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and their motherland.</p>
<p>In the seven months since "Central" moved to Shanghai, the gross profit has reached 6 billion National Currency, making it the only profitable transportation enterprise under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications. This huge profit is used to purchase new aircraft, ground equipment, and transportation vehicles. The number of ground personnel has also surged to more than 1,200, with a total monthly salary expenditure of 200 million.</p>
<p>However, the head of the Flight Group and the Chief Pilot are not complacent about this. They all say, "Our purpose is not to make a profit. We have only one goal: to expand China's aviation industry, to do our best to lay a foundation for future progress, and to prove to the world with facts that the Chinese people have the technology and ability to operate airline routes independently."</p>
<p>Currently, they still have two major difficulties to overcome: (1) The lack of buildings and hangar facilities cannot be reconciled with the ever-expanding aviation industry, and it is impossible to accommodate so many new aircraft. At the same time, a modern airport is what they are looking forward to day and night. (2) The huge customs duties paid when purchasing new aircraft and ground equipment have increased their burden. These difficulties are currently being requested for assistance from the wise authorities.</p>
<p>Chinese commercial aviation is nurtured and growing in Longhua Airport, and now it is about to take a big step forward! The vast Chinese wilderness is their virgin land to be cultivated, and the whole world is their battlefield. Their success is to be expected!</p>
<h3>Cable Fees to Europe and America Adjusted According to New Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>The International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications has been ordered to, starting today, change the fees for news telegrams sent to various countries in Europe and America, which are valued in U.S. dollars converted into National Currency, to be calculated according to the Central Bank's U.S. dollar exchange rate, at 3,350 National Currency per U.S. dollar. At the same time, the rate of conversion of gold francs into National Currency has also been changed to 1,100 National Currency per gold franc.</p>
