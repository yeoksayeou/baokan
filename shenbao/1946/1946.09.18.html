<h3>王逆揖唐之女　爲父聲請覆判</h3>
<p>林逆柏生死期不遠</p>
<p>〔本報北平十七日電〕華北頭號巨奸王揖唐被判死刑後，判決書今已送達，歷述王逆自僞臨時政府以至僞華北政委會委員長任內之各大罪狀，謂其「早歲歷任要職，而不惜名節，乘機竊發，罪惡昭彰，自應處以極刑」。惟王女淑珍，蕙珍，及其選任律師，已爲王逆聲請覆判，謂王於受審時因病不能答辯，故不能依刑訴法第二九七條逕行判決。並謂，王乃於三十三年六月一日前辭擠委員長，應予减刑，其後雖任僞諮詢委員，但靳雲鵬亦未被檢舉，云云。惟一般觀測，王女之聲請覆判，主要在拖延執行時間，而期王逆病死獄中，蓋王逆聞判死刑後，已少進飲食，企岡在執行前促致病死，監獄方面已嚴防其自殺。</p>

<h3>大局屆決定關頭　馬歇爾特使昨由牯返京　當晚在行館與司使晤談</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕馬特使十七日下午五時三刻由牯返抵京，同行者一美籍婦人，携帶行李多件，馬氏下機記者曾訪問關於與主席晤談情形，馬氏循例不作答覆。旋記者詢以夫人近况，答以「甚好，謝謝你」，並吿以夫人須待下週始返京。據悉：馬夫人原定今日偕同返京，旋以蔣夫人之堅留　故延遲下週始返。馬氏返行館后，司徒大使旋於七時往晤，傳涇彼亦於後半小時前往。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕和平商談前途，目前已届嚴重而微妙之階段，三數日來一般人士均屬望於馬特使之返京再能帶來若千佳音，同時更進一步希望主席早日返京，俾問題磋商不必再往返週折，然昨日周恩來又以「羣衆」事爲題而赴滬，並由王炳南表示，將待軍事三人會議召開有期始行返京，由此跡象，周氏大有藉故避開之意，是則和商前途實難想像。</p>

<h3>我決在九龍城設治　郭特派員曾訪港督交涉　外部何司長申明我態度</h3>
<p>〔中央社香港十六日電〕粵寶安縣政府，爲在九龍城設立治權事，經講外交部兩廣特派員請示外部，率復依照一八九八年北京條約，九龍城設治，事屬可行，正在籌備進行中，港政府十四日發表否認中國在九龍城主權之聲明，頗引起一般不明瞭該條約內容者對九龍城治權發生疑問，外交部兩廣特派員郭德華，十六日下午會見港督楊慕琦爵士，聲明中國政府將不放棄條約權益，九龍城政治正在進行。按一八九八年北平條約，中英協定訂立九十九年期限之新界租約，但條約上規定中國官員不妨碍英方保衛香港之武備條件下，得駐九龍城，並行施治權，條件並規定中國官員及艦船得在九龍碼頭一區往來停泊，一八九九年因「新界」鄉民武裝反抗英軍警接收土地房會，駐九龍城中國官兵被驅逐，但權益事實上並未喪失。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕外交部發言人情報司何司長鳳山本日接見記者，並答覆記者所詢關於報載香港政府發言人最近發表談話，否認九龍城內區域仍爲中國領土及中國目前在該區行使治權一節，申明我方之態度，特分誌如后：問：茲據香港政府發言人稱：「一八九九年中國官吏在九龍城內之治權，已因與英方軍事需要有所抵觸，宣告中止」一點，是否屬實？答：查一八九八年中英展擴香港界址專條內載：「現在九龍城內駐紮之中國官員，仍可在城內各司其事，惟不得與保衛香港之武備有所妨碍」。約中既規定中國官員仍可在城內各司其事，則我國自必派官員進入，因我對九龍城內治權，從未放棄故也。問：關於此種條約上之解釋，雙方有無歧異？答：設雙方對條約上解釋有歧異時，即依照國際公法，應作有利於承担義務國之解釋，而我國在一八九八年中英租借九龍條約中，爲承担義務之國家。</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州十七日電〕當香港中國漁民被港府壓迫派代表來穗呼籲之際，港府復公佈侵佔九龍城治權，因而更引起此間人士之嚴重注意。大光報今以「香港政府又一不智之舉」爲題，嚴厲指責英殖民地政策，謂：彼等對戰後中國地位不曾加以考慮，更不認識中英友誼關係而常　入不愉快之事件。文末強調稱：此舉已觸起我國人極大憤怒中國決不再受殖民政策的愚弄。</p>
<p>〔中央社香港十七日電〕此間官方對中國郵報今日之消息未加評論，該報謂：中國政府不欲放棄任何九龍在條約上之權利，並欲在九龍及早重建中國司法權。該報謂：「一向可靠之中國消息」謂中國外交部駐兩廣外交特派員郭德華，代表中國政府，以此事爲主題，致函香港總督　慕琦。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕英駐華大使施諦文，十七日接見記者時，以堅決之語調稱：香港政府所屬關於九龍主權問題之聲明「殊屬準確」！惟謂：渠本人對早期歷史不大熟悉，英使甫自滬歸來，對滬印象甚佳，雖經一週之快碌酬酢，無絲毫倦容，據稱：英商務考察團日內即抵華，並將赴各地觀光，中英商約談判短期內亦可開始。</p>

<h3>政府應多造營房可促進軍民情感</h3>
<p>余楠秋清查歸來談話</p>
<p>〔本報漢口十七日電〕湘鄂贛區清查團第三組組長余楠秋氏，頃對記者發表赴贛清查經過及感想。據稱：此次在贛接受密告案件，其中有三分之一，係屬房屋糾紛，而大部又係由終軍隊及倉庫所佔據，例如九江江西省立職業學校，即爲被佔之一，經向供應局交涉，始由該局令飭軍隊遷讓復校，但如此事實所在多有，考其根源，其咎亦不能單責軍隊本身，蓋國防預算，迄今未到，無法建築營房，致軍隊佔據民房，幾成不得不已之習慣，影響社會秩序甚大。且此種民房，環境惡劣，不適軍用，一方足以減低軍隊素質，一方又造成欺侮人民之機會與口實，貽患更屬無窮。爲糾正此一缺陷，國防負責當局．似應於全國各軍事據點，及交通口岸，着手築建營房倉庫，以期澈底解決。採用分期興築，與現金徵用民房兩種辦法，俾能逐漸改善，以增軍民情感，要不能以司空見慣，而有所縱容也。余氏最後表示：此一問題，當再以目擊所得，作成建議，提交本屆參政會，轉請政府注意。</p>

<h3>接受歷史的教訓！</h3>
<p>十五年前的今天，舉世皆知的「九一八」，日本帝國主義者正以大砲轟擊我瀋陽北大營，不戰而佔領了我國東三省，這不僅是日本對於我國發動侵略戰的開始，而且也是第二次世界大戰的導火綫。從那一天開始，我們就揭起反侵略的大　，經過十四年的艱苦蓄鬥，始獲得最後的勝利。今天回想十四年來的經歷，不啻有隔世之感，其間不知經過多少次的挫折與屈辱，其間更不知流了多少血，汗，與淚。幸賴我賢明的領袖　蔣主席，領導全國軍民，艱苦抗戰，百折不回，始終指揮若定，「以不變御萬變］，終於克服了最後的難關，收復我們的失土。這不僅足以表現出我民族至大至剛的精神，而且也證明公理必能戰勝強權，正義終可克服暴力。</p>
<p>今天是我國抗戰勝利後的第二個「九一八」，我國朝野仍以沉重的心情來紀念這個歷久不忘的國難紀念日，並不因侵略者業已屈膝投降而稍覺寬慰。橫在我們面前的世界，還有許多問題尚未解決，不持世界和平締造不易，國際政局演變無窮，而潛伏着的僅略勢力，且有「野火燒不盡，春風吹又生」的顧慮。甚至我們所不顧施以報復的敵人，且有敢公然侮辱中國人爲「第三種人」者！我們遇到這個紀念日，格外需要警惕！</p>
<p>第一，在大戰期間，有遠見的政治外交家，早已料到戰後締造和平的不易，所以不待戰爭結束，即主張盟國不僅在戰時需要合作，在戰場上共同奮鬥，以爭取最後勝利，就是到了戰後，還需要團結，在外交上努力，以締造世界和平。但是這種真知灼兌，在大戰結束後一年來，好像父被庸俗陳腐的爭覇觀念所掩蓋，在戰場上駢肩作戰的盟邦，目前竟似又將分道揚鏕，各奔前程，甚至對於以前敵國所採取之政策，亦有同牀異夢之感。例如英美法蘇四國的對德政策，各有巧妙不同，而美蘇二國的對日政策，亦復如斯。這種局勢如果聽其演變下去而不設法挽救，則其結果所屆，勢必徒然有利於戰敗國的抬頭，或乘隙而復施共故技。</p>
<p>第二，盟國管制德國及日本，均有相當成績；尤其是日本，不持政治民主化，而且經濟社會，亦相當安定，一年以來，已漸無戰敗國的痕跡。這自然是我們寬大政策之收穫。但是日本民族，向來崇尚武士道，迷信武力爲萬能，以侵略爲美德，「神的子孫」的陳腐思想，根深蒂固，依然觸處即發。所以我們敢說今天日本國內，尚保留着法西斯的細菌，一俟時間成熟，侵略勢力就會重行抬頭。爲今之計，麥帥管制日本，應即加緊工作，以撲滅日本國內法西斯的細菌，使其侵略成性的軍閥永無再起的一天。</p>
<p>第三，人類是理性的動物，應該最能接受歷史的教訓，世人批評凡爾賽和約大抵攻擊法國對待戰敗的德國失之太苛，以致促使人民歸附於納粹。因此今日大家都主張，對待戰敗國，絕不該重蹈覆轍，採取報復政策。巴黎和會討論對義，羅，匈·保·芬五國和約，英美代表即抱此種精神，即我國王外長，亦在巴黎發表談話，以寬大對待日本爲言。但是我們不得不向採取寬大態度的各國進一言，報復政策固不能束縛戰敗國，永遠不能翻身，但寬大爲懷亦應有其限度，否則矯枉過正，無異於扶助以前敵國侵略勢力的長大，不論對己對人，都是有害無益的。</p>
<p>第四，在十五年前九一八事變發生之初，世界各國無不視爲「局部事件」，與整個世界無關，當時惟有美國國務卿史汀生，認爲日本的侵略中國，足以危害世界和平，屢次向英國建議，採取聯合行動，以制止日本的侵略暴行，殊不料英國外相西門，目光如豆，不僅不表同意，皮而在日內瓦國聯會席上，發表親日謬論，使日本的侵略氣燄，更加高漲，終致引起中日戰爭以及太平洋戰爭。由此可知，世界和平不可分割，今後對於任何一角落的事件，均不能認爲一地一隅的事件，而大國想要孤立，已不可能。這種見解，早已爲時代所摒棄。如各國如真欲維護世界和平，必須大家採取杜漸防微的政策，隨時隨地，準備撲滅侵略的火種，以確保世界的集體安全。</p>
<p>第五，國際聯盟本來是第一次世界大戰後維持世界和平的機構，對於任何國家的侵略暴行，都負有制裁的任務。但國聯在「九一八」事變之後，對於日本侵略中國，未能發揮其權力，以致其聲望一落千丈，日趨式微，終至壽終正寢。這一個寶貴的教訓，是值得聯合國的各國當局深思的。聯合國機構能否爲維持世界和平最有效的工具？當視其能否迅速解決任何國際爭議而定。但安全理事會常任理事國得行使其「否決權」，足使聯合國機構對於任何牽涉大國的重大問題，不能有所判斷，這一個缺陷，足以構成其致命傷，急需設法補救。否則聯合國機構的前途如何，還在未定之天。</p>
<p>要之，「九一八」國難紀念日，給我們一個極大的鼓勵，足以加強我們的信念，就是：中國民族經過這一次空前的攷騐之後，可以自信，今後遭遇任何困難，都是可能征服的。因此，瞻望國內局勢，目前雖似陷於僵局，但終必仍能打開。同時「九一八」國難紀念日，又給我們一個嚴重的教訓，要我們格外警惕，保持勝利的果實，而又須隨時戒備，隨地防範，以遏止侵略勢力重復抬頭的趨勢。</p>

<p>近代的關稅，除掉極高度的工業國家，利於自由貿易，或尚受到片面協定的束縛，無法自由調整其稅率外，多少含有點保護的色彩。在工業落後的國家，尤賴此爲唯一的防禦工程。凡獨立國家，適度的調整其關稅，斷無可以非義的地方。</p>
<p>勝利以來，外貨充斥，許多工廠已遭受到關廠或減工的厄運。其倖而存在的，也都聲嘶力盡，竭力地在掙扎。各方面因此大聲疾呼，提出許多方案來謀挽救。這次上海市參議會的大會期中，這類提案，亦復不少。政府對於這一點，也未嘗不知道，不想法。諸如調整外匯，廢止出口稅，舉辦低利貸款，及收買生絲等等，並已分別辦理。獨於提高進口稅這一項，却始終徬徨却顧，抱着非常慎重的態度。最近雖有修改進口稅的傳說，聞其要點，依然限於限制非必需品，和禁止奢侈品這兩項，仍舊沒有酌增進口稅的準備。此中原因，無非爲盟邦美國正在謀關稅壁疊之削平，不使獨特異議，破壞全局的緣故。其用意，原也無可厚非。不過民族工業的安危，關係國家的生命，而保護關稅，又係維護民族工業的必要措置，其間輕重緩急，自有分別，實不容不急謀取捨，以符合兩利取重，兩害取輕的原則。</p>
<p>如本報昨日所載聯合社華盛頓的電訊，好得採行這種政策的，已不乏先例。如印度，巴西，智利，墨西哥，及澳洲等國，皆已公然聲明：在新興工業國家，保護關稅爲不可少。印度等國也都是同盟國家，她們的工業程度，還都在我國之上。美國雖感到相當麻煩，却也寄予相當同情，並沒有十分惡劣的反響。可知我國今日，如果採取適宜的而又合理的保護關稅，在國際間，也並不就會發生狠多的困難。因爲我國工業的脆弱，與目前所遭外貨的壓迫，他們未嘗不了解；他們了解的程度，或者還在我們之上，也未可知。所以修改進口稅則，和調整進口稅率，在今日已屬刻不容緩之舉，似無所用其躊躇。否則等到油乾燈盡，國人之脂膏已竭，再也沒有外貨的購買力，於輸入外貨來華的國家也未必有利。</p>
<p>不過保護關稅也須具備若干條件，在事前不容不周密準備，以期達到預期的目的。第一，須慎選對象。假如我國本無這項工業，就無所用其保護。凡屬機器和交通工具這一類貨物，近人管主張予以獎進，就是這個道理。第二，所訂稅率，要恰巧提高到適當的程度，使牠能與外貨競爭。倘超過了這個程度，便是收入主義，不是保護關稅；如不到這個程度，又失掉了保護的作用，談不到保護關稅。所以單憑直覺，只圖省事，混而統之，把某類進口稅提高幾分之幾，那是無濟於事的。第三，須把要保護的工業預先仔細地審核一下。就是說，此項工業，究竟值不值得保護。因爲天時或地利的關係，自有一類工業，無法用人爲加以促成的。還有某種工業，其基礎過於薄弱，還够不上保護，或其產量太少，遠不足以供國內的需要，那麽，直接提高關稅，無非間接提高物價，增加民眾的負担罷了。因此之故，我們雖然贊成合理的保護關稅，却不贊成貿然從事，使牠變相地又成爲「財政關稅」！</p>
<h3>經濟弭戰運動</h3>
<p>杜魯門總統最近訓令魏南特代表，向聯合國經濟暨社會理事會提議，主張明年下半年召開國際會議，討論保存及使用世界資源，以改善全世界人民生活標準的問題。這確是世界和平的福音。</p>
<p>誰都不能否認，殖民地是帝國主義的生命，世界資源是帝國主義者的血液，數百年來的國際戰爭，無不爲了爭取殖民地與爭取世界資源而引起。一般有高尚理想的政治家，早已大聲疾呼，要求平均分配世界資源。在第二次世界大戰之前，主張經濟弭戰最力的，首推比利時內閣總埋汪齊蘭，他曾到美國去研究這個問題；就是英國外相霍爾爵士，也曾在國際聯盟中發表演說，主張重行分配世界資源，企圖緩和德國對於殖民地的要求。但是這些論調，在大戰之前，徒托空言，未能見諸事實。</p>
<p>這次大戰之後，大家都抱着美妙的幻想，認爲在戰時駢肩作戰的各盟國，到了戰後，必能合作到底，決不會「利令智昏」，再因爭取殖民地爭取資源而以兵戎相見的。所以這一個問題，好像已被人忘懷了。美國參議院外交委員會主席康納萊，於本年六七月間，前往巴黎，出席四國外長會議，目睹國際問波瀾迭起，深知世界和平的前途不容樂觀，返國以後，就提出了一種預防第三次世界大戰的計劃。其中最重要的一點，就是：「美國應以全力援助聯合國機構之經濟暨社會福利計劃，俾能完成維持世界和平所必需之各種條件」。康氏對於國際政治的意見，向爲美國朝野所重視，尤其是這個計劃書是他的精心傑作，杜魯門總統自然也非常注意。這次杜總統首先倡導經濟弭戰運動，大概也受了康氏的影響。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統致函魏南特，有二點最值得吾人的注意。他說，「在今後數十年內，可能將原子能用之於和平用途」；他又說，「保存世界資源，可能成爲和平之重要基礎。」這是經濟弭戰最好的解釋。</p>
<p>戰爭終了剛剛一年，而戰神又在隱約中威脅着我們了！但是大戰之後的世界，創鉅痛深，誰還願見戰爭的再起？唯有訴諸人類的良知，以求避免戰禍之道。經濟弭戰運動，在目前確是值得倡導的。</p>

<h3>美對蘇外交政策分歧造成國內政治危機　杜魯門今日召見華萊士　華氏去留問題當可決定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十七日廣播：杜魯門定明日（十八日）召見華萊士，華氏是否將留任現職，將在此次會議中決定。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十六日電〕杜魯門總統與民主黨主席漢尼根，於商務部長華萊士宣佈渠將繼續發表公開演說反對政府之「對蘇強硬」計劃後，今日曾不內閣內部對外交政策發生分裂一事有所會商，歷時甚久。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十七日廣播：衆料華萊士將於今日返華盛頓，與杜魯門總統舉行密談。茍華氏按照其業已宣佈之計劃，繼續發表其反對國務院外交政策之演說，則政府勢必發生極大之震動。華萊士雖稱無意解職，但內閣之危機並非完全不可能發生。據巴黎來訊稱，美代表團正在等待杜魯門與華萊士會議之結果，並充份相信總統將支持貝爾納斯，甚至要求華萊士解職，或請其在將來發表演說時，不再涉及外交政策，不然即派其私人飛機「聖牛」號赴巴黎，將美代表團載回。民主黨中之保守份子對於華萊士深感憤懣，並提醒杜魯門謂，華萊士原爲共和黨員，在羅斯福推行新政期間，始參加民主黨，故應以開除黨籍加以懲戒。羅斯福夫人亦發表意見云『吾人認爲總統之某一秘書必未審愼閱讀華萊士之演說，不然總統決不致不顧及貝爾納斯之反響。美國之外交政策必須由國務卿及國務院決定，但人民有求瞭解此項政策以及表示其自己意見之權利。對蘇聯之恐懼已在國內造成，但余認爲此種恐懼缺乏現實性。</p>
<h3>華萊士率真挑戰仍堅持原來立塲　定下週二再度發表演說</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十六日電〕商務部長華萊士今日又率真向國務卿貝爾納斯挑戰，表示堅守原來主張，繼續攻擊其所謂『對蘇強硬』政策。華萊士於內閣分裂危機增長聲中，消度週末假日返京，即以電話與杜魯門總統交談，並即發表下列聲明：「余堅持上週四渠在紐約之演說，極右及極左兩派均不滿余之見解，實堪玩味。感於大多數美國人之關切，余願爲公正與持久的和平繼續努力，余將於最近之將來，對此項問題，再度發表演說。」華氏預定於本月廿四日在羅特島發表演說，該演講會係國民政治行動委員會主辦，華氏前在紐約麥迭遜廣塲之炸彈性演說，亦係該一團體所主辦。華氏並擬在全國各地從事演說，華錯之決心重親掃揮外交主張，不僅增加期與貝爾納斯間之分離，且擴大其本人一派與民主黨其他份子間之裂痕。華氏在紐約之演說已遭南部各州民主黨員之嚴厲抨擊，惟弗洛里達州參議員貝柏則例外，殊堪注意</p>
<p>損及聲譽圖謀補救</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十六日電〕美政府領袖諒已在計劃如何可以補救因華氏之演說及總統之出爾反爾，而損及美對外外交政策之聲譽及國內之團結，預料貝爾納斯不久將切實宣布政府之外交政策，尤其是關於蘇聯之部份，而杜魯門總統則將予該一聲明以鄭重之批准。美國人士已有要求總統對華萊士採取更切實之行動者，共和黨報紙並發動「華萊士必須去職」之運動。接近華氏之人則謂會氏決不辭職，華氏認其演說乃反蘇及親蘇兩絕端派間之中庸之邁。</p>

<h3>美航艦訪問希領海　蘇南同時提抗議　美不參加英土海軍演習</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十七日廣播：蘇聯與南斯拉夫雖對美航空母艦「羅斯福」號之訪問瞧得起領海提出抗議，但美海軍部今日宣佈，「羅斯福」號返國後，不久將由太平洋方面二萬七千噸之「倫杜爾夫」號駛往地中海瓜代，是以美國在地中海方面之海軍部隊，將常有航空母艦在內，海軍部發言人否認美國將參加土英在地中海方面之海軍演習，因此舉足以引起誤會。</p>

<h3>烏克蘭控案</h3>
<p>安理會討論無結果</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約成功溯十六日電〕聯合國安理會本日陸續開會，討論烏克蘭控訴希臘案，澳代表赫斯普克及荷代表克里芬斯威謂，烏克蘭代表馬努爾斯甚控訴希臘，全無事實根據。提議設立小組會，負責決定所提控訴案是否合理，此舉將使安理會得以摒棄一切毀謗或不適當之要求。以努爾斯基即繼起發言加以駁斥。但英代表賈德幹插言曰，馬努爾斯基並無阻斷安理會程序之　，甚至　事會理事亦無此項權利。蘇代表葛羅米柯爰乃提出新建議，要求安理會強迫希臘政府，採取步驟，以制止希臘侵略份子之活動，但安理會對葛氏之建議，並未付諸表決，旋即散會，至十七日續開。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約成功溯十六日電〕安理會上屈主席波蘭代表蘭琪在最近之希臘問題討論中，在處置方面似有軟弱之弊，預料蘇代表葛羅米柯邏二輪做主席後，會議面目將大爲一變。</p>

<h3>蘇聯與英美對峙　足以推翻和平佳果　羅斯福子著書述乃父言論　認赫爾利爲駐華適當人物</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十六日電〕故總統羅斯福之公子伊利沃所著「羅斯福見聞錄」一書，今日由「展望」雜誌發表其第二篇摘要，披露羅斯福與邱吉爾戰時長期爭論之內幕。關於聯合國大軍全面反攻計畫，邱吉爾原主張從侵攻馬來及巴爾幹兩處著手，羅斯福則竭力贊助美軍參謀長馬歇爾在法北諾曼第登陸之計劃，爭持良久，卒採用馬帥策略。太平洋方面，據羅斯福稱：英方亦反對麥帥之跳島戰略，而主張沿中國海岸北上，取得進攻日本本土之基地，對美軍之重視菲律賓基地，並不了解。羅氏對此解釋稱：「或英方以爲其殖民地人民不致擁護其作戰，因而非　不明瞭菲人會奔向我國旗巾。」關於巴爾幹，羅氏稱：「邱吉爾深懼放任蘇聯勢力過於強大，容或在歐洲強大；但此是否係壞事，須看許多因素而定。余並不主張置美軍生命於危境，以保護歐洲方面眞的或假想的英國利益。「由羅氏觀之，德黑蘭會議最大成就，厥爲向史達林說明美英兩國並不組織共同集團以反對蘇聯。羅氏並稱：「有一事啼以推翻戰後蘋果車者，即世界最度分裂，以蘇聯與英美對峙是也。」據伊利沃言，其父衷心頗喜史達林云。</p>
<p>該書並涉及有關中國之一段。謂美國前任駐華大使赫爾利，在羅斯福對華工作中，被認爲「適當人物。」據羅氏告其子曰：「余所不欲國務院中人爲之事，可飭赫爾利爲之，國務院中人已往曾擬將致余之公文電報秘不使余知，或故意稽留，或竟留中不發。」關於史達林及否決權問題，伊利沃稱：羅斯福於一九四三年德黑蘭會議中，曾與史達林意見一致，以爲運用個別的否決權使三強行動一致，實屬必要，羅氏並認三強一致行動實爲戰後世界所必須。</p>
<h3>南國爭特港主權　以拒簽和約相威脅　軍委會通過義領土不得設防</h3>

<p>〔聯合社倫敦十六日電〕英政府現考慮承認阿拉伯聯盟之方案，但未必與該機構樹立正式外交關係，僅爲今後英與其各會員國間交涉時，即可經由該團體辦理。按河拉伯聯盟爲阿拉伯各國之永久會議故承認一事，實在行政方面較政治方面更爲重要。</p>

<h3>日本新憲法　本報特派員傅俊儀寄自東京</h3>
<p>日本的新憲法經衆院六星期審議後，終於八月二十五日一致通過，送交貴族院，刻由該院逐條審議中。此新憲法修正案是日本第九十次臨時議會辯論的最大焦點。日本政府這次向議會提出憲法修正案的動機，據日皇在議會開幕典禮的勅書中所聲述的理由，是「余基於國民之至高總意，尊重其基本人權，俾國民之自由福祉得以永久確保，而排除強化民主主義傾向之一切障礙，更百而拋棄戰爭，期求世界之永久和平。故願將表現國民自由意志之憲法，予以全部修訂而奠國基。」其實主要的原因，當然是在披瀝日本履行</p>
<p>波茨坦宣言的誠意，同時這也是波茨坦宣言課予日本的義務，所以麥帥對於此次的新憲法案，也特別關心。在該案提出議會的第二日（六月二十一日）關於該案的審議，特發表一重要聲明，謂（一）關於憲法的各條審義，須予以充分的時間及機會；（二）明治二十二年所公布的現行憲法，在法理上具有存續性者應予確認；（三）憲法各條約表決，應由日本國民自由表明之意志而定。由此可見麥帥該案之重視，並可知現行憲法在某些地方亦准繼續存在。這次修訂的新憲法共有十一章，計一百零三條。除序文外，第一章爲天皇，以天皇爲國民統合的象徵。第二章爲戰爭的放度，排除一切武力。第三章爲</p>
<p>國民的權利及義務，國民享有一切基本的人權。第四章爲國會，分爲參衆兩院。第五章爲內閣，規定內閣總理大臣由國會議員指名，即多數黨執政的制度。第六章爲司法，司法獨立，一切司法權均屬於最高裁判所。第七章爲財政，處理國家財政的權限，須根據國會的決議，皇室的費用亦須經國會通過。第八章爲地方自治，地方公共團體的首長均須由住民選舉。第九章爲修正憲法的修正，須經國民投票表决，第十章爲最高法規，尊重人權與國際條約。第十一章爲附則。這次改訂</p>
<p>新憲的特點在使這新憲法具有國民憲法（並非人民）的性格，所以在憲法序文裏使用國民憲法及日本國民等。至於國體，據政府方面的解釋，則決無變更。據稱：日本國體的特色，是在國民內心的深處，天皇與國民結合爲一，而以天皇爲憧憬的中心。關於主權所在的問題。在序文中的規定是在國民，而非人民，這國民裏包含有天皇在內。天皇的地位是日本國家的象徵。據政府方面的解釋，僅以肉眼觀察日本國家的統合，在印象上難予理解，只有仰望天皇時，日本國家的情形才可浮現於眼前。關於宣言拋棄戰爭一點，日本各報及外國記者均大事稱贊，其實新憲法最進步的一點，是第三章確認國民的一切基本人權。例如勤勞權，及團體交涉權。在衆議中</p>
<p>爭論的焦點是憲法裏的第一條其中規定天皇是日本國民的象徵，及日本國家統合的象徵。天皇的這種地位則基於日本國民的至高總意。政府此次在議會答辯中，儘量避免使用人民二字，而麥帥在聲明中，則明確表示應將全權置於人民手中。金森國務相在衆院答辯中，只承認主權在包含</p>
<p>有天皇，國民全體。後來認爲這句話的意思非常曖昧，再加以訂正，說是主權在民，這裏包含有天皇在內。換言之，天皇及一般國民是國民的構成員，國民這一個概念，即指構成國家的人，君主也在其內，自由國家構成的要素，人民就是國民。自由黨採取國家主權說，主權係由天皇與國民二者構成，而社會黨則認爲主權係在包含天皇之國民協同體。大家對於國民及人民的概念，都區別得很清楚，所以不願意使用主權在民這句話，而贊成主權在國民，因如說是主權在人民，天皇的地位就變得非常明顯，將要失去他的存在價值，人民當然是對君主而言，包含有君主在內，人民豈不是矛盾嗎？現憲法雖然自稱是國民憲法，而非往日的臣民憲法，可是主權倒底是屬於國民呢？還是人民呢？難怪日評論家鈴木安藏說：我們學界認爲新憲法在</p>
<p>根本原則上，應與舊憲法完全不同，但有一種政治勢力想將舊憲法的原則繼續存在於新憲法。雖然這次新憲法在理論上有些矛盾的地方，尤其是關於主權問題缺乏明確的規定，仍舊把天皇的地位規定得過高，可是進步份子的影響，例如社會黨的義論，起了很大的作用在四月總選舉時，自由進步兩黨部都主張主權寄托統治者及國家，而這次居然首先贊成主權在國民的主張，而且自由黨提出修改第八十四條關於皇室財產的規定，主張一切皇室財產應屬國有。這說明了保守份子迎合時流的投機心理。至於</p>
<p>共黨的態度，對於天皇制則完全予以否認，野坂參三在議會裏的演說稱：一切國家在法理上，應有自衛的武力。否認最小限度武力的存在，就等於否認國家及種族的獨立，可是波茨坦宣言中解除日武裝的規定，將如何履行呢？共黨的無祖國，及反對戰爭的口號，又將如何自圓其說呢？現校報憲法正在貴族院審議中，咸認不致有多大的修改，最多不過是字句上的修改而已。據本日讀賣新聞載稱：將於本月廿五日貴族院本會議中通過，俟貴院通過后，日皇即將正式公佈。華盛頓遠東委員會發言人亦曾謂：不久對新憲法予以承認，所以日本新憲的成立僅是時間的問題罷了。（完）</p>

<h3>質詢行總分署工作　劉鴻生成眾矢之的　參議會電請政府交涉收回港九澳　今日聽取敵產處理局報吿</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日上午市參議會第十二次會議，特請「行總」上海分署署長劉鴻生出席報吿上海區救濟情形，及答覆質詢。各議員對於「行總」工作均甚關心，詢問至爲熱烈，劉署長除以口頭解答一部份外，餘均書面詳答。</p>
<p>繼「行總」報吿與詢問後，大會開始討論民政提案。下午第十三次會議繼續進行，討論頗爲精彩，議決提案十件。昨日大會通過市參議會會址設於前日僑自治會原址，並通過電請政府交涉收回香港九龍等案。</p>
<p>今日上午大會將舉行第十四次會議，由敵僞產業處理局負責人出席報吿工作經過。然後討論未完之民政案五件，如時間允許再擬討論金融工商經濟等提案。下午則爲第四次審査會。</p>
<p>行總上海分署的施政報吿和參議員對於行總工作的質詢是昨天上午大會議程的重心。署長劉鴻生和副署長王人麟都親自出馬，分署各級的負責人也大部列席。</p>
<p>劉署長提綱挈領的宜讀分署工作報吿，講得非常簡單，他說願意多留一些時間讓議員們提出詢問。報吿的內容有如一筆籠統的流水賬，詳細數字另外油印分發。他說：上海分署是在去年十月間成立，到今年八月底止，十個月來的賑務如下（一）經常的救濟將所得物資配發中外團體教濟老弱殘廢。（二）臨時的救濟如設立施粥廠庇寒所等。（三）郊區的救濟派遣工作隊至四郊分期放賑。（四）雖民的救濟，設立難民接轉站及招待所等。（五）失業工人的救濟成立臨時委員會，發給麵粉維持生活。（六）舉辦以上代賑協助疏濬河浜淸除垃圾等工作。（七）配發各級學校奶粉麵粉。（八）設立夏令兒童遊憇站，收容貧寒兒童。此外衛生方面所做的工作有（一）撥給病牀及設備協助醫院復員，（一）設立診療所，（二）設立免費病牀，遣送免費病人，（四）辦理衛生巡視團，（五）設立牙科訓練班，（六）設立奶粉配給站，（七）設立魚肝油配給站，（八）設立兒童飲奶站，（九）撥給病牀四百張協助防疫。至於今後工作經本月初南京檢討會議決定將着重於善後方面。</p>
<p>報吿甫畢，參議員的質詢一個緊接一個紛紛提出，劉署長成了衆矢之的。</p>

<h3>善後不善前　窮人死後才有棺材　生前無法獲得救濟　參議員羣起質詢</h3>
<p>張志韓問：今夏疫勢猖獗之時，市府爲了淸除垃圾向行總接洽卡車，但行總一定要現款交易，後未幾經交涉才撥借了一部份，請間行總是否成爲「生財有道」的機構？往者已矣，現在垃圾問題依舊嚴重，希望行總能多撥些車輛帮助市府。</p>
<p>美豪問：（一）上海分署收到的物資和經費究竟有多少？（二）這些物資和經費的用途究竟怎樣？（三）腐爛的物資究竟有多少？（四）剩下的物資究竟還有多少？（五）今後改善的計劃如何？</p>
<p>張學濂問：上海分署有三多：第一是汽車多，滿街都是救濟總署的車子。這些車子與其給分署職員享受，何不拿來救濟行荒？第二是霉爛物資多。物資與其霉爛，不如不要，旣可省一筆運費，也少佔些倉庫地位。第三是物資出售收費的多。從前時候辦救濟辦得不好要「殺頭」，現在沒有這種辦法了。但長此下去，所有的救濟物品恐怕都要到交易所去掛起牌來。請問分署成立之初，可有什麼計劃和步驟？</p>
<p>莊平問：對於「隱貧」一類，尤其是淸苦的敎育文化界人士，爲什麽有的幾次三番申請都得不到救濟？</p>
<p>侯雋人問：本市郊區如江灣大塲等地抗戰期間所受損害都較市區爲重，爲什麽現在所得的救濟極少？</p>
<p>賈德超補充侯雋人的質詢外，另問：（一）行總工作真可以說是「善其後而不善其前」，舉例說馬路上的窮人死後有棺木的施捨，生時却得不到救濟。又譬如防疫，在疫勢猖獗以後才來救濟，事前爲什麽不來預防？（二）魚肝油的配給，領到的人很少，究竟是什麽原因？</p>
<p>邵永生把「救濟」與「善後」分開來說，他問：「救濟物資拿來出售收費，則救濟意義何在？行總在計劃的時候就缺乏悲天憫人的博愛精神，好比做文章忘了題目。希望今後工作不再蹈救濟的覆轍，機構勿太龐大，辦法要痛下改革」。</p>
<p>陸克明問：「數字報吿中舊衣舊鞋都以包數計算，試問一包究竟有多少。傳問市上許多商店出售的舊西裝都從救濟總署而來，請問究竟有無其事？</p>
<p>何成甫補充陸的質詢，更具體舉出林森路思南路口某一家出售舊西裝的商店爲例。</p>
<p>丁善明請分署與工務局等接洽，多用以工代賑的辦法，推行郊區建設。</p>
<p>馬君碩問：「分署領到的舊衣有六千多包，已發放的僅二千多包，舊鞋領到的有一千五百餘包，已發放的僅九百餘包，請問其餘的如何處置？發放的標準如何？每包件數究竟多少應該算明。</p>
<h3>參議會辦公處有着落　設前日僑自治會原址</h3>
<p>行總報吿和答復質詢完畢後，休息十分鐘繼續開會，議長報告關於參議會會址，已於十五日下午會同市長前往察勘，北四川路上海劇院已破損不堪，估計修理費用須三萬萬元，故不能適用。蓬路原來日僑自治會房屋尙屬完整，大小亦已足够，但現爲美軍海軍俱樂部租用，到十一月中期滿。當與敵產處理局接洽届時不再予以續租，呈請政府撥作本曾會址。</p>
<p>最後討論第一小組委員會業已審査完畢之提案，因時間關係，僅及修正通過民字第一號議案『加强本市地方自治機構職權以推進地方自治事業案」後即吿會。</p>
<h3>劉鴻生從容不迫　登台灣答問舊衣事　我非包打聽　衹有天曉得</h3>
<p>質詢至此吿一段落，劉署長從容不迫的走上主席台。他首先說：「諸位對於上海分署不很滿意，但是別的分署都說我劉鴻生有辦法，把東西都拿到上海來了。」接着他說：（一）最寃枉的是關於拖垃圾卡車的事，我自己家門口就有垃圾。但是出售物資是總署的職權，非分署所能過問。並且到現在還在用，又十輛則借給其他衛生機關。究竟我帮不帮忙，可以問問衛生局張局長。（二）吉普車數量分署一共祇有三輛，其中一輛供總署派駐的外籍人員用，一輛供發放賑品人員用，一輛供職員大家坐，兄弟自己就從來沒有坐過。（三）所謂霉爛物質有些如去脂奶粉和麵粉等，因爲品質成份不同，色澤有些異樣，其實並非霉爛。（四）行總有無一整個計劃這一點很難確說。我說是有計劃的，但有些事情如防疫等事前都不能預料。（五）郊區救濟比較少，那是因爲救濟是以人數爲標準，如防疫工作就因爲市中心區患者比較多的緣故。（六）商店出售的舊衣服是否救濟物品，那是要我去做「包打聽」才能知道。也許我們發給難民，難民自行出售亦未可知，此外商人亦可直接向美國坎拿大定貨，據我所知其價格是美金三元五角一磅。（七）魚肝油的配發必須根據醫生證明，因爲它不是自來水可以取之不竭，人人可發。（八）舊衣舊鞋每包件數有多少那是所謂「天曉得」，連外國人自己也不知道。（九）出售物資的收入作爲經費，那是由於實際上的困難，因爲政府雖有救濟總署的經費預算，至今尙未撥發。（十）『隱貧」的救濟因爲總署與聯總訂的時不在救濟範圍之內，且非分署職權所及。</p>
<p>繼續質詢</p>
<p>張志韓起立駁質關於舊衣每包件數　　長所說的「天曉得」，他問爲什麽不可以拆開來點點淸楚。</p>
<p>副署長王仁麟走上台來解圍，他補充兩點：（一）關於「隱貧」的意義很難確定，現在已經規定分成普通和敎育文化兩方面來辦理。（二）舊衣每一包的內容從小兒尿布起至跳舞禮服止，什麽都有，過去已經利用學校設立整理站加以整理裁改，現學校雖已開學，將仍設法繼續。</p>
<p>時間已經十一點鐘了，議長雖已宣佈過停止口頭質詢，但不少議員仍紛紛在席次發言·王維咽問美方對行總工作不滿，行總有何辦法改善？費樹聲認爲行總辦事太洋化，救濟應多由本國機關辦理。孫震春指出參議員的質詢均非惡意，並非把劉署長當作「包打聽」，此外他更請行總多注意郊區的救濟。瞿鉞也特別再提出救濟工作應多多注重郊區。莊平則一再堅持要劉署長對於「隱貧」救濟給予肯定答覆。</p>
<p>再度答覆</p>
<p>劉署長再度聲明他的職權僅限於上海分署，所以關於美方對行總工作不滿一節，他說美方對於上海分署倒是相當滿意。至於洋化一點，因爲物資根本是靠外國來，事實上免不掉，不過救濟工作凡是本國機關都已有接洽担任。此外他並表示接受參議員的建議，此後當注重於郊區的救濟工作。接連串的質問，接連串的答覆，空氣相當緊張，劉署長顯然有些精疲力盡了。常朱學範再問及行總的整個救濟政策時，他有些答非所問。最後詹文滸站起來說：「答覆詢問不應含糊敷衍，要說負責任的話，如果口頭不能答覆的不如用畫面。」</p>
<p>至此，議長決定終止口頭質詢，未完的改用畫面答覆。</p>
<h3>會場花絮錄</h3>
<p>昨天參議員對於行總的質詢，空前熱烈，劉鴻生左右招架，累得幾次咳嗆。下主席台後又幾次摸出手帕抹汗。其實質詢內容大部份都是對整個行總而發，作爲上海分署署長，他可以說是「代人受過」。</p>
<p>劉鴻生報吿上海分署的工作，簡明雖然簡明了，但失之於草率。他答覆議員的質詢，爽快是爽快了，但「海派」氣息似乎太濃厚。</p>
<p>參議員發言的姿態大有可觀。有的張手舞足，有的搖頭擺腦，有的呆若不鷄，有的侷促不安。昨天有一位穿長衫的議員走到麥克風前一手持稿紙，一手撩起長衫，情態非常滑稽。</p>
<p>王人麟副署長談到救濟物品中有許多高跟鞋，發給難民旣不適用，想拍賣外國人又不答應，說是他們捐出的衣着鞋襪希望能直接穿到難民身上。他請參議員諸公代爲想想辦法究竟怎樣處理？</p>
<p>昨日上午參議會議長宣布休息十分鐘後，各人都離席去調劑一番精神，突然二樓右角一隻大水銀燈被大風吹打下了，幸而這時沒有人走過，也沒有人坐在席上，否則參議會中不免又將閙成血案。</p>
<p>吳紹澍前晚由廬山返滬，昨日初次到參議會，早晨看見熟人就握手，認識他的人也過來和他道候，大有應接不暇之勢。</p>
<p>劉鴻生報吿完畢後說：諸位參議員如有問題提出，我準備給諸位「審問」。他聽了議員們說上海分署救濟不力後，速說「寃枉」，並鄭重的聲明：「我劉鴻生生在上海，長在上海，預備死在上海，所以對於上海的救濟不會馬虎的」。</p>
<p>傅統先提出一點意見，要求市政府多多注意郊區市民的衛生和福利。他說：「滬西有條浜名叫「臭水浜」這「臭水」兩字已成了專門名詞，出了名，對於上海市實在是一個恥辱！</p>
<h3>參議會昨討論　民政方面提案　撥用寺廟問題引起熱烈論辯</h3>
<p>昨日下午，參議會繼續討論有關民政方面之提案，所討論者爲民宇第二號至第十號。其中民字第三號，關於「請市府配撥自治機構辦公房屋，以利推行自治案」，對撥用寺廟一點，各參議員頗多論辯，民政處處長張曉崧並有所說明，言辭稍激烈，並有「倘區公所等沒有房子，我民政處長不幹了」之妙語，若干參議員認爲失態，旋由張處長自動登台道歉，各參議員鼓掌，誤會冰釋，皆大歡喜。</p>
<p>第三號提案，審査意見中列有五項辦法，其中第二項即爲引起風波之「撥用寺廟及公共建築物」。王參議員正廷起立稱：「一般人士興築寺廟，自有其用意，而公共建築亦自有其用途。自治機構不應聲請撥用，將他人化錢所造之物，奪歸已用，最不應該，故應將此項辦物取消。」各參議員大爲鼓掌。朱文德謂：「不妨。將撥用改商借」。王正廷又稱：「商借極佳，但一切建築物皆可商借，不限寺廟及公共建築物，故不必明文規定」。詞畢參議員鼓掌者更多。此時議長稱：現將此點表決。王劍鍔突起立，對區公所房屋困難情形有所說明。張曉崧氏更詳加解釋。參議員之情緒遂爲之改觀，表決時廢止此項辦法未獲通過。最後所通過之第二項辦法爲「撥用或借用寺廟及公共建案物。」</p>
<p>裁撤冗員</p>
<p>第二號提案由，原爲「擬請市府裁員節政，以輕市庫負担，同時提高待遇，以增進行政效能案」。各參議員討論結果，認爲公務員待遇係中央規定，本市市政府無權單獨提高，及改爲「興辦在職員工福利事業」。並將「以輕市庫負担」一語删除。對於辦法一項，馮有眞發表意見謂：「不重要之冗員，應即酌爲裁撤」欠妥，蓋冗員豈有重要不重要之別，建議改爲「冗員應即裁撤」，結果通過。</p>
<p>省市劃界</p>
<p>民字第四號提案案由爲「省市劃界，迄未解決，以致政令紛歧，無所適從，應從速釐定，以利管轄案」。決議通過二項辦法：（一）請市府咨行江蘇省政府，對於劃界問題，迅即繼續商討，作具體解決。（二）就現行劃入本市而尙有糾紛之地區，巳設立自治機構者，應同時設立警察機構，以行使警權。</p>
<p>建設郊區</p>
<p>第六號提案係「請市府從速擬定建設本市郊區計劃，以榮市面而利發展案」。辦法分公用事業，衛生，敎育，治安及其他五項。傅統先發言稱：郊區建設較市區更爲重要，更爲迫切。並建議將本案「交市政府各主管機關計劃，逐步實施」，結果決議通過</p>
<p>撤換偽員</p>
<p>第七號提案，係「請市府及各局迅速撤換僞員案」，因中央對於此點已有所決定，乃決議「交市政府遵照三十五年八月九日行政考試兩院通吿，切實辦理。」</p>
<p>關於第十號提案「擬請褒揚本市抗戰陣亡將士，殉難軍民，並撫卹遺族，以勵忠藎案」，有人曾提議將本案撤消，但多數參議員認爲撤消欠妥，乃決議「請政府辦理」。</p>
<p>至於第五號，關於「本市前臨參會決議通過之案件，其執行程度應予檢討案」，審査辦法爲「提交各專門委員會辦理」，經大會決議，暫將本案保留，俟討論第十組提案，關於專門委員會間題時，一併討論。關於第八號「嚴懲貪汚以符法治案」，大會決議撤消，因整肅官常爲政府厲行之政策，公務員貪汚，一律嚴懲，參議會無需再作決議案。關於第九號「於各通衢設置市政意見箱，以採納民意，而利市政興革案，』因參議會素來接受人民之陳述與告密，逕案參議會，遠較投於「市政意見箱」，方便，故決議撤銷云。</p>

<h3>撥用廟產一插曲　王正廷推敲引證舌戰羣儒　張曉鬆激昂陳詞痛駡和尚</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕昨天下午，天氣是陰沉沉的，市參議會會塲裘也是陰沉沉的。第十三次會議討論民政提案，議員們爲着一件提案案由的字句，這個認爲要修正，那個覺得還有補充意見的必要，另一個又不以爲然，翻來覆去討論了半天，大家正在感到苦燥無味的時候，突然發生了一幕插曲，頓時好像給大家打了一針提神劑。……</p>
<p>在大會決議民政第三號「擬請市府配撥自治機構辦公房屋，以利推行自治案」時，有幾位議員對於辦法中第二款「撥用寺廟及公共建築物」紛紛提出意見。王參議員正廷昨天是第一天報到，他對於「撥用」兩個字認爲很不滿意，他說：寺廟是老百姓自己拿錢出來造的，不管它有用無用，總是人家的私產，我們不能任意撥用人家出錢造的房子。如果可以撥用私產的寺廟，那末隨便什麽人的房子我們都可以去撥用了。</p>
<p>後來龔夏和陳保泰等提議將「撥用」改爲「商借」兩字。但是這位老外交家又搖頭了。他說：商借可以指任何房于，私人的房子也可以商借，這根本不必規定在辦法中。</p>
<p>也許是看見幾位議員對這問題解決不了，民政處處長張曉崧抑制不了自己的情感，要求發言，他提高了嗓子說：「寺廟雖屬私產，但內政部及行政院已經有通令寺廟可拿出來辦地方自治事業」。頓時，他想到了區公所借用寺廟被趕出來時，馬上氣得怒髮冲冠，他越說越憤慨了：「像靜安寺，玉佛寺等裏面的和尙，吃鴉片，喝酒，嫖，賭，我們爲什麽不可以把他們的寺廟拿來做區公所？」接着他拿起了一本筆記簿朝桌上」拍，大聲嚷道：「如果這事辦不好，我這個民政處長也不幹了。」張處長的激昂言詞，雖然博得熱烈　聲，可是也惹起了不利的後果。</p>
<p>王延松說話了：「我個人和張處長是好朋友，可是站在參議員的立塲上說，張處長今天似乎有點失態，和尙吃·喝·嫖·賭·應該向市政府提出來依法辦理，不必對我們參議會這樣說。」跟着，莊鶴礽也提出「抗議」：「參議會是民意機關，我們要決定一件案子，有表決的方式可按照，不應該以「去」「留」來要挾。張處長今天的態度是非常不應該的，我認爲有向參議員正式道歉的必要。</p>
<p>在靜靜的二分鐘緊張空氣下，張處長勇敢地走上了發言台。帶着十分誠懇的態度，他說：「我們在厲行民主政治的時候，做一切的事，的確要取決於民意，本人因爲在過去十個月來爲區公所的事受到了許多苦惱，所以今天講話激烈了些，我接受詣位的意見，向各位道歉。」「但是，區公所的問題，還是希望諸位設法解決」。張處長短短的幾句話使大家都感動異常。</p>
<p>事後，王延松跟王正廷說：「今天你第一天報到，我呢，第一次發言，就闖了個禍。」</p>
<p>從好幾位參議員的談話中，我們對昨天這一塲風波到得了一個結論：「張處長昨天的態度、雖然說話有些過火，可是我們都能明白地諒解張處長的苦衷和他爲人的直爽和誠懇，尤其是他能屈能伸的精神，是値得我們敬佩的。財之途徑，故本黨以外之洪門弟兄，如能發揚洪門精神，爲國家民族效力，本人極感愉快，蓋殊途同歸，我人最終之目的仍係相同·司徒氏並稱，將來歸國籌備組黨之華僑領袖出國以後，民治黨總部中將仍有海外代表常駐參加，保特聯絡。該黨海內外黨員已在三百萬人以上，一切經費，均係自籌，此八十二高齡之民治黨領袖，對歸國後所見所聞，頗多感慨謂「國內同胞間相處情形，與華僑在海外時之親愛精誠，殊有不同。」司徒並表示不久將晋京謁見主席。</p>

<h3>駐滬美軍新聞聯絡處一女兵　伍鳳美小姐　從小生長在美洲　第二次回來祖國</h3>
<p>她稱美女兵都希望交一個中國朋友　對上海婦人印象矮小鮮艷和嬌嫩</p>
<p>〔本報特喜〕美國駐滬女兵，最多的時候，曾到過二三百人，大都已陸續撤退團國了，現在留下的女兵，最遲到本月底，都要離開上海，大部份將分別調至北平南京工作，也有重新投入故鄕的懷抱的。</p>
<p>美軍新聞聯絡處軍曹書記伍鳳美小姐，從小生長在美國，但是父母都是中國人，在雙親的薰陶下，她對中國有了特別强烈的愛好。她喜吃中國飯，尤其是廣東菜，她愛穿中國衣，尤其是去年流行的短襖長褲。她說：「道種衣服穿了比較靈活些！」對於現行的短旗袍，也寄予相當的好感，她認爲這種式樣是比較合理的，所以自己也做了一件，是黃顏色的，因爲她最愛黃色。</p>
<p>中國人　最有民族性</p>
<p>伍小姐生於澳里昂洲薩倫地方，那是一個幽靜的小村莊，僅有二家中國人，因爲中臘人都一歡和本國人聚在一起，所以大都集中於舊金山紐約等處熱鬧地區·伍小姐說：中國人是最有民族性的，包括她母親在裏面，在她母親的意念中，什麽都是中國好！</p>
<p>伍小姐第一次來中國是在一九二四年，曾經到過廣東和香港，此番重來，覺得變遷很多。問她對上海的印象如何？她皺皺眉頭說：「一切都很好，只是太墊，我生平從來沒有到過像上海這樣炎熱的地方！」當記者吿以這在上海也是例外中的例外時，她笑着答道：「那是我的運氣太壞了。」因爲到一個新的地方，總不斷地會有許多新的刺激，所以她說她並不想家。在她們中間，也極少患思鄕病的，反而有些伙伴們，在到了這個古老的中國後，立刻愛上了它，所以也有即使在退伍以後，還願久留在此地的。</p>
<p>學會了　三句中國話</p>
<p>她們的宿舍在連爾西愛路華懋公寓中。此外，在跑馬廳有游泳池，圖書館，綱球塲等，每天在工餘之暇，她們總愛逛馬路，讀小說，或作運動。她們都希望能有一假中國朋友，但是由於工作的忙碌，機會太少，大多不能如願以償，因此，大家都引爲莫大的遺憾。對於上海女人的印象是：矮小，鮮艷，和嬌嫰。</p>
<p>她們大家都想學中國話，有許多人已經請了先生敎授國語。同時在短短的幾個月中，她們大家都學會了三句話，而且是反複應用着的，那便是——「不好」，「不懂」，和「我是美國兵」。譬如她們到小店裏去買東西，對貨物不中意時，她們就說：「不好」，假若店夥加以解釋時，她們就說：「不懂」，而繼續糾纏不淸時，她們會急急地迸出最後一句話來：「我是美國兵」！</p>
<p>好奇心　中秋的月餅</p>
<p>她們固定的薪給，大多不足應付目前高漲的生活，伍小姐說：「這是戰後普遍的現象，經過嚴重的破壞後，供與求不能平衡，於是生活程度高漲，有限的牧入不够支出，原是必然的現象了」。好在她們都無負擔，所以經濟對於她們，還不致是個最嚴厲的威脅。</p>
<p>對於中國固有的每一個習俗，她們都發生很大的興趣，中秋的月餅，香斗，鞭砲，都曾吸引過她們的好奇心，她們一致表示：「要瞭解中國，不能單看表面，鞭砲和鑼鼓雖然無聊，但是你假使肯加以深入的觀察，中國的每一個節期，每一種風俗，都是有它歷史上的根據和價値！」</p>

<h3>「飛虎將軍」領導下　空運隊出月起飛</h3>
<p>陳納德昨日招待新聞記者</p>
<p>一秉過去協助中國之精神　盡力人人民謀福利</p>
<p>總站設廣州·設備費由行總撥付</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕「飛虎將軍」陳納德（見圖），昨假樂義飯店招待記者，對「陳納德空運隊」成立經過有所陳述。首稱，余自一九三七至一九四五年間，先後統率美航空志願隊及十四航空隊轉戰中國，協助中國之抗戰，今日乃欲於當日作戰之地，助之復興。八年從事戰爭之目的有三：（一）爲中國人民爭取自由；（二）將日軍驅出中國境外；（三）維持中國主權。凡些三者，幸皆成功。惟我人前爲完成此項任務，破壞中國之交通亦鉅。故今日乃欲一秉過去協助中國之精神，救濟災區飢病難民，補救工業戰時蒙受之損失，改善中國人民之生活，並協助提高中國人民之敎育水準。</p>
<p>空運隊以廣州爲總站，一切設備等費用約美金二百萬元，由行總撥付，其主要任務，亦即爲述輸行總之救濟物資，至行總所指定之地區。外界不明眞相之觀察者，有誤會陳氏此舉，係企圖加入中國內戰之一種手段，並謂此空運隊意欲與中國各航空公司競爭，陳氏鄭重聲稱，彼之目的在於援助中國人民，絕非參加內戰，空運隊之主要活動地區僅以華中華南爲限，在此等區域內，彼意並無內戰進行，至於競爭一層，實屬過慮，因空運隊係暫時性質，行總結束時，空運隊亦即解散，以目前空運之缺乏而論，空運器具即五倍於目前所有，亦未能盡副常前之需要。</p>
<p>除此行總所供給價値美金二百萬元之器材外，開辦時所需其他雜費的需美金一百萬元，多由前曾參加航空志願隊及十四航空隊之人士暫籌。飛行人員，亦多由彼等充任，正式航空員之月薪爲美金八百元，如飛行時間在八十小時以上，每小時另增五元。預計三星期內即可開始飛行，三個月內當可進入正軌狀態。陳氏預計飛機噸位或僅足運輸救濟物資，惟如地位有餘，則或將搭載復員之乘客。收費將依交通部之規定，惟救濟物資則因與行總有合的關係，運費將特予折扣。陳氏籌組此隊，已歷多時，記者有詢其何以遲延至今，始吿成立者，陳氏答謂因各方接洽頗費周折之故，但謂若於四個月前即獲成立，當可使多數難民，蒙受極大之利益。</p>
<h3>司法行政部顧問　龐德今由滬飛美　定明年六月再度來華長期工作</h3>
<p>世界法學權威，我國司法行政部顧問龐德敎授，定於今晨偕夫人由滬起飛返美，預定明年六月間再行來華長期工作，按龐氏來華三月，工作異常緊張，曾就我國法制作初步綜合硏究及批評，先後提供數萬言之意見，其要旨爲：（一）中國旣採行大陸法制，三十餘年，不宜多所更張。（二）中國主要法典，大體甚爲完善，具徵當年起草者頗有硏究。（三）今後宜努力提倡法律敎育，以充實法學，並編著有系統之法學鉅著，俾法律之解釋及運用，趨於統一化。（四）中國法制仿自西洋，間有不合國情處，今後宜加以調整，使適合中國之需要。（五）任何法律制度，皆有其歷史及社會背景，西洋法制之背景與中國不同，移植於中國未必皆宜，應斟酌國情予以取捨。（六）中國之人才濟濟，中國人應有自信心，勿專事摹仿他國。（七）中國學者近有主張廢除檢察制度，而代以英美之國家律師制度者，亦有主張採行英美等國之陪審制度者，此由於不明各國法制之實際情形，不足爲訓。龐氏返美後，當就我國各部門之法制作進一步之研究，以便提供意見，以備我政府參考。</p>

<h3>撞見面首少婦起殺心　鎚擊刀砍無所不用其極　老司務深夜險遭毒手</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕南京女子秦明英，二十九歲，住南市館譯東衖鴻安里一號東後廂房，平素悍潑蠻橫，。結髮丈夫亡故後，曾與人姘居，旋即吿仳離。本年五月間，秦經人介紹，又識在麥根路三泰印刷所爲老司務之上海人王利生，同居南市。甫閱四月，秦以王月入不豐，時起勃谿，對王利生非常厭惡，又擬再覓新歡。</p>
<p>本月十五日，王工作完畢返家，瞥見有一年的卅歲之西裝男子，橫臥於其床上。一經盤詰，秦反爲之掩飾，稱其爲前夫之友人。王未獲確據，亦無可如何。當時因王尙有他事，必須外出，乃忿然離家。秦非特不使該男子離去，反備肴款待，並招同弄六號之陸素珍作陪，共進晚餐，待王深夜返家，則彼等均已離去，是晚秦內心似有不快，籍故又向王索錢，王即將　中所有之現鈔萬餘元，悉數交與。嗣秦又以菜刀一柄授王，囑令磨快，王但欲博秦歡心，即將刀接去磨得光亮銳利。當夜相安無事，翌日（十六日）王於下午六時返家，較平時回家略遲一小時，秦又扳百般尋釁。迨夜間睡至十時牛，秦忽潛起趁王熟睡無備用脚向王腰部猛踢，王自夢中痛極驚覺，業因踢中要害，口中鮮血直冒。王忍痛掙扎爬起，秦復以玻璃杯擲其頭部，使王昏厥，腮部亦受重創。秦猶恐其抵抗，再以鐵鎚擊其脊骨，王痛不可耐，大聲呼援。秦聞其高呼，恐驚動鄰居，乃一不作二不休，即以隔夜囑王磨就犀利無比之菜刀，向王亂砍，王此時神智稍淸，乃以手臂招架，當被砍傷。此時同居鄰人已聞呼喊之聲，相率至東廂房中，見王已遍體鱗傷，秦仍圖肆暴，乃爲衆人所執，扭交崗警帶入南市邑廟分局訊辦。王則被送至醫院救治。</p>

<h3>菲島歸來的王正廷縱談華僑生活　又從市參議會說到國人與國事</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕靜寂中，我忽然聽見棋梯上一陣輕快的脚步聲，接着，王正廷先生就走進了客廳。王先生的頭髮已經差不多全白了，使我不禁感覺到有些意外。</p>
<p>僑務發展</p>
<p>王先生說；「我到菲律賓去的時候，已在羅哈斯總統受任之後。現在，菲律賓在大體上，秩序已趨安定，雖然有一部份地區還有些小紛擾，實際上也並不很重要。華僑一般的生活也還好，但是對於華僑在菲律賓的各種企業，菲律賓的新政府已決定了一個新的限制，就是菲籍雇員的薪津至少要佔全公司薪津總額中的十分之六，這却使華僑也許會感到相當不便。因爲　津的限制和員額的限制不同，一位職位較高的人所得的薪津也許超過了十個低級的雇員，而菲籍人士之中，好的人才也還是相當缺乏。旣受薪津比例的限制，華僑就不得不多用菲律賓人，同時還要把他們的職位相當提高，菲島人才旣少，業務的進行就感覺困難了。」</p>
<p>我問：「美國在承認菲律賓獨立的時候，是否仍舊保持着一些商業上或其他方面的優先權呢？」</p>
<p>王先生說：「當然，美菲兩國以前的關係如此深切，情感上自和其他國家不同。但在承認菲律賓獨立的時候，美國所要求的祇是菲律賓要把若干海空軍根據地租借給美國使用，至於究竟租借那幾個地方，則由兩國另行談判決定。」</p>
<p>中菲貿易</p>
<p>接着，王先生談起了菲律賓的華橋商會。華僑商務上如有糾紛，往往都由商會調停，有一家美國報上曾對此指摘，說是華僑商會破壞了菲律賓的主權。王先生說這完全是一種誤會，因爲這種調停的意義，事實上僅相當於「吃講茶」，主要的目的還是在於避免因細小的糾紛而涉訟，根本談不到侵害菲律賓的主權。</p>
<p>談到增進中菲貿易時，王先生說，菲律賓最需要的是布；茶和絲的需要都很小，但是我們的布却是自己都還嫌不够。</p>
<p>關懷政治</p>
<p>因爲王先生是市參議員，我就請問他對參議會的意見。他說；「我以爲人民對政治=這樣關切，是一個很好的現象。但是市政府的效率將來能不能及上以前的工部局，我却實在覺得恐怕未必。」</p>
<p>他輕輕撣去了雪茄烟頭的灰燼，熱心地說：「我常說中國人最缺少三種東西。第一，我們缺少組織力。全世界組織力最强的該是德國，其次是英美，法國就差得遠了，中國是根本說不上。試看政府各機關疊床架屋的有多少？做起事情來非但遲緩躭擱，而且牽制也特別來得多。這種組織力是應當從學習中養成的，祇要肯學，不怕不會。</p>
<p>一種力量</p>
<p>「第二，我們缺少一種相互配合的力量。中國人做生意，一向是各目爲政的。從古以來，『家』的觀念在我個中間是非常有影響的。在山西的各票號裏做事的就大都是家人父子，親戚故舊。你要把幾家票號聯合起來組織一個股份公司，十之八九就不會辦得成功。就說這次勝利之後的接收罷，也就是吃了不能配合的虧，於是各機關就各自爲政的接收，封條的種類五花八門，成績非常使人失望。其實，上海的一切敵僞產業，應常全部責成上海市政府接收，封條也應當祗有上海市政府的一種。這樣統一接收之後，然後再加處理，就不會紛亂了。</p>
<p>「最重要的是第三種，中國人的合作心太差了。在別的國家，負責做事的某人得到成功，往往大家就認爲這是整個國家成功的一部份，所以大家出全力來鼓勵他，幫助他成功。在中國不然，一個人快要成功的時候，別人會在一旁想：何以成功獨屬於他而不屬於我自己？於是排擠破壞，不遺餘力，結果是大家不能辦事。這三種毛病，我們必須用敎育的力量，一一加以克服，否則中國的事情就永遠不能辦好。」</p>
<p>談鋒健旺</p>
<p>王先生的談鋒很健，使我想起了他常年在國際間折衝樽俎時的上姿。</p>
<p>他說，「我對於國事的看法是如此：少數人必須服從多數，否則是談不丰民主的。但是，這少數人應當還是有批評這多數人的權利。如果這多數人的意見有錯誤，經過這種批評之後，原來的多數，也許就會成爲少數，而服從新的多數了。這才是民主的眞精神。」</p>
<p>王先生是一位非常忙碌的人，他才從菲律賓回國不久，可是最近也許又要離開上海到別處去了。</p>

<h3>千倍償付存款事　司法院長之意見　茲事體大正與財部熟商中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨以戰前銀行存款法院判決依照一千倍償付事，往訪司法院長居正，叩詢意見。居院長答稱：若依物價指數而言，一千倍並不爲過。蓋如米布等價較戰前有上漲五千倍或一萬倍以上者。但商業銀行準備金中百分之二十，係存於國庫，不得動用。此點損失，亦應顧到。現上海四行儲蓄會，不服判決，提起上訴。法院如予駁斥，亦屬非是。茲事體大，問題甚多。若不解決，則戰前債務之淸償，長期儲蓄到期提存時，此等問題，必多糾紛。前曾與財政部兪部長談及此事，現正商議解決辦法中。</p>
<h3>全國劃分　九個經濟區</h3>

<h3>金鈔平穩</h3>
<p>給赤昨仍平靜，晨開二一四萬七有賣，開後即自二一四萬八，遭賣戶所包圍，漸形微挫，惟在二一四萬左右，頗費掙扎，十時後央行以二一三萬五之價配給五〇條，此後曾微降至二一三萬二，而後稍平，午刻在二一三萬五左右，午後即交先退至二一三萬，隔日交割仍升至二一四萬左右，結果較前收無榮辱，飾金紋銀銀元均平，暗息以銀根告鬆，退至一角三左右。</p>
<p>外幣繼續平庸，惟港幣稍有軋高，美鈔晨開三三八〇元有賣，中途毫無變化，後以金市微降，午刻退至三一六〇元而後稍平，午後微升，結果較前收升五元，港票初平後堅，亦好三元，港匯初平後穩，港申電報縮少許，而扳高爲六九五元至七〇五元，印匯亦帶好爲八四五元有售，英匯微昂至一一四〇〇元有供，美匯仍站牌價。</p>
<h3>公債微挫</h3>
<p>公債成交仍見暢盛，達票面七百餘萬元，買戶仍以零散居多，間有金融性之納戶，尙形穩定，統丙晨開二一〇〇元，開後曾低至二〇五〇元，即有買方活動，中途盤好至二一八〇元，始吿回頭，臨收又退至二一〇〇元以下，結果較前收微挫五〇元甲乙戊平平，統丁軋跌一〇〇元。</p>
<h3>外股繼續下降　局勢形成一面倒</h3>
<p>外股斬售存貨繼續不斷新買戶絕迹，局勢又在一面倒之下趨降，各股除紙業祥泰尙穩外，除者都難振作，結果較前收計怡紗英聯降半成，鋼業跌落一成，業廣亞洲會德豐，怡啤雖跌尙微，紙業平平。</p>
<h3>劃一秋繭收價　不得低於二十萬元</h3>
<p>本届江浙兩省秋繭收買價格，迭經中蠶與江浙兩省當局，三區繅絲同業公會，多次會商結果，以鼓勵蠶農生產，提高鮮繭收價，曾決定以三担米價，折合鮮繭一担之價格，旋因各地米價參差不一，爲求統一收買價格起見，復又數度會商，次定將收買價格劃一，經呈當局核示，茲悉：該項決定劃一價格，業經當局核准，每担鮮繭價格，不得低於十二萬元，現江浙兩地繭行，開秤在即，其收買之價格，均須遵照此項核定之劃一價格收買，不得抑低，以恤蠶農。</p>
<h3>人造絲出三百萬關　一般綢廠商驚惶失措</h3>
<p>人造絲連朝氣焰汹湧，黑市塲人心激昂，買戶不絕，昨日又竄出三百萬元關外，一二〇號天橋有光晨開三百〇五萬元，即較上日大八九萬元，上午最小〇二萬元，最大〇八萬元，後做三百〇六萬元收盤，下午持貨者盲目扳抬，〇六〇八萬元有成交，最後十萬元有人要，賣出者喊二十萬元，比上日又高十四五萬，雜牌一二〇號有光大十一二萬元，半光上午做二百七十萬元，下午喊七十萬至八十萬元，廠經受人造絲影響，用戶絲交易頗繁，市况堅秀，惟高勻度乏人過問，以致市價難以看好，綢貨大的均提高一成左右，但交易尙未見展開，一般綢廠商，均惶惶終日，不知所措，因原料風湧飛升，綢貨實有駟馬難追之感，</p>
<h3>食糖存底頗豐</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市食糖，形威恐慌，各南貨業配給者，不易購買，但據航業訊，本市存糖極爲充足，招商局第二碼頭，即中棧，第五碼頭，即浦東楊家渡，兩棧之存糖不下三十餘萬包，業已堆儲數月，未見提出，因之昨日有海宇輪自基隆來滬，裝到大批台糖，竟無法堆存云。</p>
<h3>木材去路有限</h3>
<p>木材市况，中秋節後，市况尙未振作，洋松因到貨續至，去路有限，市價在成本綫徘徊，杉木亦因到貨湧至，賣方忍痛虧本，故一般木材市况，前途難以樂觀</p>
<h3>國人發明之人造棉花</h3>
<p>雙十節左右可開工</p>
<p>據悉：喧傳已久之人造棉花，於最近期間即可問世，記者昨晤由杭抵滬之人造棉花發明人胡逸，據稱：彼現與實業界沈益果合作，擬於上海杭州兩地籌設中國人造棉製造廠，現廠址等問題均己解決，的於雙十節左右，可正式開工。</p>
<h3>各銀行凍結外匯　央行下月起收購</h3>
<p>據確悉，中央銀行對管理外匯，已採取進一部之處置，除美匯外，所有各銀行凍結之外匯頭寸，如於本月底尙未支付，届時各銀行外幣存款，將由中央銀行依照當時市價收購，此後各外商銀行將不能開立外幣存戶，俾杜絕以美鈔私自抵結外匯云。</p>
<h3>美太平洋航綫　避開中日　改向南洋</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約十六日電〕據海事委員會方面所聽取之報吿，美國太平洋方面之航綫，其興趣似正自日本與中國方面，轉移至馬來亞與荷印方面。此種傾向，一則由於擴充南太平洋方面航業之願望，一則由於對日對華貿易之捉摸不定。目下美國輪船公司欲去該方面創辦新航綫或恢復舊航綫者，的有十家，戰前則僅有三家。</p>
<h3>新秈中次續跌　雜糧亦無起色</h3>

<h3>戰前存款增加給付合歟（上）</h3>
<p>— 謝廷信</p>
<p>戰前存款增加倍數償還事，因四行儲蓄會上海分會一案，經上海地方法院判令一千倍給付後，己引起經濟社會之密切注意。民間債權債務之糾紛，亦將因此層出不窮。此次法院方面所根據判決者，爲卅四年十二月十八日所公布之「復員後辦理民事訴訟補充條例」第十二條之規定及司法院院字第三〇一八號解釋，謂對於增减給付，爲普遍應用之規定，關於銀行方面之給付，旣無除外之明文，自應加以適用云。是皆偏袒存戶一面之判決，至因此判決後對於銀行方面是否公允，似未加充分之考慮。爰就管見所及，分兩方面申述之。</p>
<p>在法理方面言；</p>
<p>一，抵觸儲蓄銀行法　判決書內判令銀行償付一千倍之唯一理由，謂「被吿於收受儲蓄存款後，果將一部存款作爲流動資金，其餘存款或購公債及其他債券作爲擔保。或投資於房地產，以資穩固。其必將收入之資金爲多方面之活動與利用。縱公債因受財政部照票面還本辦法之影響，而蒙受相當損失外，在其他方面之投資，莫不大增其貨幣之數値，自應使負增加一千倍之給付，以維公允。」查被吿係四行儲蓄會儲蓄會運用資金必須依照民國廿三年六月廿二日立法院通過同年七月四日國民政府公佈施行之「儲蓄銀行法」辦理。儲蓄銀行法內第七條於對儲蓄銀行運用資金有下列之規定：</p>
<p>儲蓄銀行非依左列各款方法，不得運用其資金：</p>
<p>（一）購入政府公債庫券及其他擔保確實經財政部認可之有價證券。</p>
<p>（二）以政府公債庫券及其他擔保確實經財政部認可之有價證券爲質之放款。</p>
<p>（三）以繼續有確實收益之不動產爲抵押之放款。</p>
<p>（四）以他銀行定期存單或存摺爲質之放款。</p>
<p>（五）購入他銀行承兌之票據。</p>
<p>（六）存放於他銀行。</p>
<p>（七）對於農村合作社之質押放款。</p>
<p>（八）以農產物爲質之放款。</p>
<p>足見儲蓄銀行運用資金之方法大多爲放款與購公債，絕不能投資房地產。否則即屬違法。判決書上所稱「或投資於房地產」一語，自屬猜測之詞，毫無根據可言。儲蓄銀行對於七八兩項放款則有至少額之規定，對於政府公債以外之有價證券則有品質上及數額上之限制，所以儲蓄銀行運用資金途徑可謂絕對多數爲放款與公債，此二項投資均隨幣値傾跌而减値，難以達到判決書上所稱「莫不大增其貨幣之數値」之理想。事實上銀行或有未盡按儲蓄銀行法規定而經營，但該法旣已實施，司法機關決不能遽加否認。更不能武斷以「投資於房地產」列爲儲蓄銀行運用資金途徑之一。司法機關未經派員查帳，逕自武斷，未免於法無據。此爲判決書內所忽視者一。　（未完）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨爲證券交易所第二日開拍股票，交易結果，各股仍承日前趨勢，一致下游。惟下午五時集體對帳，成績又有進境，至六時二十二分，已吿軋平。昨日證交在股票市塲又有公吿二紙，其中十七號稱：美亞綢廠之股票成交單位，自九月十入“起，改爲五百股。其一百股之股票，仍可照常交割，茲將昨日交易槪况，臚述如後：</p>
<p>昨日證券開盤時，谷股行市與昨日收盤行市相差無幾，上塲經紀人於開盤後，叫價極爲踴躍，半小時內塲中市况頗見平穩，十點半後塲中空氣轉趨活潑，交易極旺，各股行市一致上揚，永安紗廠，勤興襪衫，新光內衣，美亞織綢各熱股行市允趨向榮，永安紗廠一度升至六五八元，美亞升至四二二〇元，勤興升至二三九元，旋又略見回疲，十一時後市况又趨淸淡，交易减退，行市下游。十一點半後。跌勢較大，永安紗廠低至六二八元，動興襪衫低至二二四元，美亞跌勢尤烈，有以四〇三〇元成交者。至十二時正收盤時行市方稍見回漲，綜觀本日市塲情况與昨日相似，各票行市均稍下挫，惟跌勢不大，最高最低價差距平均僅百分之五左右，成交總額共計四百九十二萬九百股，其中永安紗廠成交一百五十萬股以上，動興成交五十四萬股，華豐成交四十七萬股，量福成交四十六萬五千股，美亞成交十八萬股，均較昨日成交數量爲多云</p>
<p>又訊，華股繼續在證券業斬多下跌落，冷股中有一二中型者突吿缺乏維持，而起慘跌，反之麗安百貨及華豐搪瓷等小股，仍有活動，屹然未動，各股萎靡至前收價以下時，一度有空方補進，獲利者亦有扒轉，廣帮略進，中途突吿反動，熱股曾漲至開市價以上，買氣始止，於是脫手之風復盛，北帮亦售，永紗首先回跌，影響其他各股，其問以大中華火柴永安公司最爲法疲，跌落甚多，榮豐華豐麗安甚爲穩定，不時有上竄姿態，臨收終以大勢不利，高後亦回，結果較前收計永紗美亞景福新光勤興中紡各跌半成不到，統益五和水泥大通稍有下挫，絲業信和內衣跌半成以上，公司新亞跌一成，火柴跌一成半爲最鉅，景綸榮豐平平，麗安華豐續有扳高，塲外各股亦稍帶小。</p>
<h3>閩粵禁運後　紗線脚地仍堅　紡建棧單準期同行歡迎　棉布開出卅七種價未動</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗市穩如磐石，華南雖無銷路，然北帮頗有進胃，中型紗紅魁星天女等牌，辦去不少，長江沿綫，客戶吸納亦股，是以紗線脚地殊堅，幷不因閩粵之禁運而稍遜，紡建之期貨棧單，同行買賣極爲鬧忙，因該公司之棧單，到日取貨，的期不爽，非比民營廠中之配售棧單，有任意拖延情事也。</p>
<p>又訊，昨晨市北帮吸收二十支紗，裝赴關外，據北帮客商稱，照今日收價，裝至關外，頗有盈餘，以故一時人心蓬勃殆後終以納胃欠旺，重趨下游，近午收盤，價格較日昨略低，計四十二支藍鳳二百十六萬，至二百二十萬元，二十支藍鳳一百四十萬元左右。</p>
<p>紡建昨開白印嗶嘰藍V字細布共卅七種，價仍照原盤，各號申請嗶嘰者甚夥，唯核准者寥寥無幾，下午四時半，發准購單後，方知老貨嗶嘰，市塲價格仍喊六萬六千元，猶無人肯脫手者，藍V字則喊六萬二千五百元，無牌彩球則喊五萬八千八百元，龍頭高檔坯布，染廠需要孔返，而紡建昨日仍無開出，以致有行無市云。</p>
<h3>行爲稅混入貨物稅　乾肉亦課屠宰稅　祇只增加收入罔顧法理</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市商會據本市火腿醃臘兩公會函，請廢止乾肉屠宰稅，特呈南京財政部及上海市政府，原函略稱：查屠宰稅係就其屠宰出售之行爲，課以法定之稅率，按照民國廿年之營業稅法，木列爲營業稅之一種，嗣於三十二年及三十五年兩次修正營業稅法時，雖將屠宰稅劃出於營業稅之外，但屠宰稅旣因有屠宰出售之行爲而課稅，則該稅之爲行爲稅，自屬無可否認，行爲稅一稱對人稅，係直接稅之一種，與對物稅之爲問接稅，隨時隨地可以轉嫁者，性質絕對不同，本市屠宰稅徵收規則第四條第一項，所謂「凡由市區以外運入之鮮肉乾肉，除持有原屠宰地征收機關所給已完納屠宰稅憑證，經査騐予以免徵』之規定，是將行爲稅擅自變更爲貨物稅，與貨物稅之須憑完稅照査騐放行者，視同一例，實屬違背稅法原理，根本錯誤，年來地方政府，頒布收稅單行章程，祇以擴大範圍，加增收入爲宗旨，對於稅法基本原則，每多未能顧到，以致納稅商人，無所措手，往往呼籲經年，不得一當，事之可憫，孰甚於斯，據函前情，合再剴切電呈，仰祈鈞部（府）鑒核，俯念乾肉屠宰稅名目，就屠宰稅係行爲稅之原理而論，萬無可以成立之餘地，即日核定，予以廢除，實爲公便。</p>

<h3>九一八十五週年　舊創痕從頭說起　新感喟不絕如縷</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>十五年前的今日，殘暴的日軍在我國東北進行侵略，造成震驚世界的九一八事變，留下人類歷史上永久的汚點。十五年後的今日，日本　敗一週年之餘，東北依舊免滿身瘡痍，撫今追昔，誠有萬千感喟與無限愴痛！</p>
<p>說起日本侵華，原是「大陸政策」中所預定。有名的「田中奏摺」，早已傳播着「欲征服世界，必先征服中國，欲征服中國，必先征服滿蒙」的謬論。又以一九二九年世界經濟發生恐慌，日本對外貿易大减。一九三一年，日本國內失業人數突增，勞工農民，動盪不安，統治者與資產階級爲緩和國內革命危機，轉移人民視綫，便不得不向外尋求出路，東北首當其衝。加以其時國際情勢，錯綜複雜，西方各國，大都自顧不暇，而中國內部，又甫吿統一，尙未十分安定。敵人認爲良機難得，乃即悍然不顧一切，發動對華侵略戰爭。</p>
<p>事變的前夕</p>
<p>日本蓄意造成九一八事件，因此事先佈置，異常周密，日軍憑藉不平等條約，在滿洲南部早已取得駐兵權，在事變前夕，日本調入東三省的軍隊，已在二萬以上，加以「在鄉軍人」七干餘，警察五六千名，此外直接受日軍指揮的「胡匪」，「蒙匪」也各達數千人。沿安奉鐵路一帶，日軍更築有砲台約八十座。至於政治方面，一九三〇年，若槻內閣與金融資本家勾結，在他們的策動之下，極力擴大軍國主義化，起用積極的侵華論者宇垣一成爲朝鮮總督，內田康哉爲滿鐵總裁，南次郞爲陸相，日本軍閥從此抬頭，行爲益無忌憚。</p>
<p>日本侵路者更思慮周詳，惟恐一且用兵侵華，將引起中韓民族聯合反抗，故在一九三一年七月間，由長春日本領事嗾使韓國農民在萬寳山地方掘河引水，衝毀我國民田數萬畝，我常地農民反對，與日警衝突，被殺傷多人，日人更對韓人擴大宣傳，顧倒是非，反指中國壓迫韓農，朝鮮各地以不明眞相，遂在漢城，仁川，平壤等地發生暴動，慘殺華僑。中國政府提出抗議，日本多方推諉。禾幾，日本反藉口中村大尉在興安嶺失踪，誣說爲我方屯墾軍所殺害。怖置就緒，遂於九月十八夜，以大軍進犯瀋陽。</p>
<p>事變發動的一幕</p>
<p>日軍乘夜在南滿路炸毀柳河鐵橋，反稱係由我軍破壞，故即開始用大砲轟擊瀋陽北大營，我駐軍三百人，死難不屈。其他各區駐軍，以事起倉卒，向後撤退。日軍南路向瀋陽推進，同時北路又對長春猛襲，佔領後，更沿吉長路進犯吉林，九月二十一日，兵不血刃，佔領全省。自九月十盡佔遼吉兩省重要城鎮，但在十於十一月十八日淪陷。東三省從此便隷於日軍淫威之下，但東北人民所組織的義勇軍，仍在暗中和敵軍鬥爭。十二月二十六日，日軍分三路進攻錦州，將奉軍完全驅入關內。</p>
<p>國際間　反響與調查</p>
<p>一九三一年九月二十一日，我國政府代表在日內瓦致函國際聯盟秘書長，請其促使國聯行政院注意中日爭端，並依照盟約第十一條，請求行政院「立即採取措置，使危害國際和平之局勢不致擴大。」</p>
<p>國聯理事會當於九月三十日，十月十三日至二十四日，十一月十六日先後舉行會議，最後成立國聯調査團，設委員五人，由理事會主席遴選，經兩當事國同意後，委員資格在一九三二年一月十四日復經理事會核准，其名單如下：李頓爵士（英），佛蘭克洛斯麥考益少將（美），亨利克勞德中將（法），馬柯迪伯爵（義），恩利克希尼博士（德）·一月二十一日，調査團在日內瓦開會兩次，一致推舉李頓爲團長。依照國聯理事會十二月十日的決議，中日兩國政府均有「派參加委員一人襄助調査團之權，」其後，日本派駐士耳其大使吉田爲代表，我國代表則爲顧維鈞氏。</p>
<p>調査團一行，在四月二十日始抵達東北，逗留約六星期，而調査團報吿書，則遲至九月四日始在我國北平簽字。</p>
<p>當時國際間對於日本侵華的反響，祇有美國的態度較爲明顯，一九三二年，由國務卿史汀生發表了有名的所謂「不承認主義」，不承認武力所造成之任何結果，並重申門戶開放政策。英國無甚表示，蘇聯眼見日本强佔中東鐵路，也未加干涉，其後又用外交手腕，將中東路　售與日本。</p>
<p>國聯調査團報吿書於一九三二年九月四日經各委員簽字後，逕寄日內瓦公布，報吿書中雖聲明尊重中國主權，但爲顧及實際情勢起見，竟建議組織東三省自治政府，由各國派遣顧問，共同參加。其時日本仍視報吿書如廢紙，置諸不理。同年年終，日軍續向楡關·熱河進攻，一九三三年二月二十四日，國聯再度進行調解，日本不肯接受，宣吿退出國聯。國聯於是決議不承認日本侵佔東北的事實。</p>
<p>新的感喟</p>
<p>蘆溝橋事變以後，全面抗戰展開，歷時八載，獲得最後勝利。根據一九四三年十二月一日所發表的開羅會議宣言，確定東三省主權歸還我國所有。一九四五年八月所訂一中蘇友好同盟條約」中，蘇聯政府亦承認東三省爲中國之一部，對中國在東三省之充分主權，重申尊重，並對其領土與行政之完整重申承認。「九一入」國恥，得以全部湔雪，但國軍前往接受之際，忽然枝節橫生，共軍阻礙進行，遷延時日，徒使東北問題日益複雜化，十餘年來，東北同胞所受的痛苦，仍然未能解除，値茲九一八事變十五週年紀念日，撫今思昔，不禁感慨系之。</p>

<h3>大學考試揭曉太遲</h3>
<p>編輯先生：我是不得不到上海來投考大學。但是第一次考後，因爲久不發表，不得不另外投考一校，否則恐怕失學。但學校揭曉太遲，不但荒廢時問，且消耗金錢，其中尤以某聯大，考試已歷一月有餘，尙不發表，即交大亦在三星期以上，使人不得不內心焦急，故懇各校儘速揭示，不勝感荷。（一個考生）</p>
<h3>請提早揭曉貸金生</h3>
<p>編輯先生：我是一個早失父母的孤兒，幸由叔父撫養長大，今年由滬新初中畢業，現在入中華職業學校，本學期學費數目龐大，達吾叔父全月的薪水，吾叔父爲一布店櫃員，每月收入，除開支家中，殊不够供給吾之學費，故請求於市敎育會貸金，而學校已近上課之日，眼看着各同學拿着繳費收據，至校辦理入校手續，乃亟至市敎育會詢問，據說：至月底可知，如此吾又被摒於校門之外了，可吾請市敎育會提早揭曉，俾一般貸金學生，得沾實惠，不勝感激！（一貸金生金振華）</p>
<h3>市立高職宜减學費</h3>
<p>編者先生：我們是上海市立高級職業學校的一羣學生，我們的家長差不多全是公敎人員，農村（許多蘇北）中的貧苦子弟，因爲無力讀高中大學，所以在去年的冬天，我們一羣窮學生轉入了這個理想的學校，因爲旣可免費，且學點專門技術，做一個中等的技術人才，我們因爲窮亦不敗奢望，在第一學期繳費是雜費六千元，膳費一萬元，書籍費等三萬元已足，但是這學期第一次發出通知單，總計雜費四萬六千元，但至九月八日又通吿說另定數目計宿費三萬元，建設費二萬元，尊師金三萬元，雜費八千元膳費第一月十萬元，並且須於註册時一次繳淸，否則取消學籍，這眞是一個晴天霹靂，幾乎驚碎了我們理想的好夢，叫我們家長臨時向那裏去籌劃，這筆浩大的廿五萬元。</p>
<p>現在我們祗有請求前任校長，李副局長熙謀先生，及敎局秘書王主任汝昌先生，來可憐這批窮學生，將這期學費，儘量减輕免遭失學之苦，則感德無旣矣。（上海市立高級職業學校，紡織土木機電三級學生）</p>
<h3>公敎物配應辦補登</h3>
<p>此次滬市公敎人員物品配給登記，適在暑期中辦理，各校都在第一次規定日期內，匆匆將手綾辦妥登記完竣。但是有些學校新任敎員，在九月初始行確定，而此時已將名單繳送，致未將新敎員列入，於是遂發生請求補行登記之情事。希望此項廉價配給權利能够普遍嘉惠公敎人員，當局應特別通融，補行登記一次。（立石）</p>
<h3>尼庵改建學校議</h3>
<p>編輯先生：我家隔壁有一所尼庵，其間所居大小尼姑，無慮數十人，她們擁有很多的房產，終日循聲誦經之外，大都聚賭抽頭。現在學校正鬧着校舍無着，學費又是這樣的昂貴，許多民衆失學，許多百姓流亡，何不將這類尼庵，改辦學校，將其庵產收入，撥充救濟經費，豈非「華無用爲有用」嗎？（鄰居）</p>
<h3>軍米是否豁免？</h3>
<p>上海縣府，前奉省令徵收軍米，每畝壹升，（作價每石二萬四千元）後見報載，囚省參議會請求得蒙豁免，而所已繳之糧，迄未發還，時隔月餘，今又收本縣地方建設費，據經收者云：即前之軍糧，前次已繳，今可免收，敢問此項軍米，究竟上峯是否豁免，若已豁免，何以改頭換面，若未豁免，儘可徵收，何必更換名目。（胡質夫）</p>

<h3>奠定歐洲和平　距目標尚遠　德奧問題複雜解決匪易</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室譯自紐約時報雜誌</p>
<p>巴黎和會的進展雖然相當緩慢，但是除了特港及其腹地問題，和希保國境問題比較難解決一點以外，其餘的問題大致已逐步解決，例如對羅對芬和約草案已經審査完畢，準備簽字了。所以最近一般的論調，認爲對義·羅·保·匈·芬五個前敵國和約草案的審査工作，可望於十月十五日前結束·各國外交人員可以轉赴紐約，參加決定於十月廿三日舉行的聯合國大會了。</p>
<p>但是歐洲和平的新基礎是不是就此奠定了呢？答案是離開這個目標還遠，因爲最重要的德奧問題，還沒有着手討論，就是討論起來，也一定更麻煩複雜，決非對德國以前的五個附庸國的和約問題可以比擬。因此我們就提出德國問題在這裏來檢討一下。</p>
<p>德國問題的所以重要，有兩點理由：（一）德國是歐洲人口最衆多工業最發達的國家，同時產煤也最　富，所以對於歐洲的將來是一個最重要的決定因素；（二）德國是蘇聯和西方國家明爭暗鬥的主要目標。倫敦時報最近曾經說過：一個分裂的德國意思就是一個分裂的歐洲，可能引起種種的糾紛。今日的德國，是由美·英·蘇·法四國分區佔領着，莫洛托夫雖然說過蘇聯並不反對德國的統一，但是事實上德國還要長時期陷於分裂狀態，這是戰勝各國意見的分歧使然的。假使聯合各國間沒有像目前那樣深刻的矛盾，德國問題還不致像目前那樣難於解決。</p>
<p>蘇美意見分歧</p>
<p>蘇聯和西方國家意見的分歧，可以說是分歧到了極點，兩者之聞不惟爭奪權力以及政治和經濟目標各不相同，甚至對於目前世界上的缺陷何在以及如何予以糾正等問題，也解釋互異，意見鑿枘。蘇聯自有她的政治經濟理論，爲了要達到她的目的，不惜使用任何手段，所以在蘇軍佔領區中，對於我們在戰爭中所爭取的四大自由，也隨時可以置之不顧，同時把一切的工商業置於國家統制之下，這種情形，對於西方各國的習慣和目標，當然是格格不入的，因爲在西方國家看來，自由貿易對於世界經濟制度的穩定以及和平的確立，乃是最重要的一個條件。</p>
<p>同時，在蘇聯人的思想中，認爲資本主義世界必然會陷於沒落和崩潰，所以他們要利用資本主義的各種弱點來加速實現蘇聯領袖所想像的更好的世界，因此在資本主義和共產主義之間要找尋相同的立塲來解決一個重要問題，實在是難之尤難了。</p>
<p>蘇聯利西方國家思想上的不同，對於德國問題的解決當然有極重大的影響。</p>
<p>蘇聯的對德政策，曾由莫洛托夫在巴黎第一次加以說明；他說蘇聯希望德國成爲强國，保持其爲一個工業國家，不贊成將德國分割。</p>
<p>雙方互相猜疑</p>
<p>但是蘇聯雖然主張德國重歸統一，可是她並不和西方國家採取一致的步驟，德國的蘇軍佔領區，已經多少在實行蘇維埃制度，且無暫時性質的徵象。假如蘇聯希望德國成爲堅强繁榮，富有生產力和統一的國家，猶如莫洛托夫所說的，那麼當然不是希望德國加入日趨衰落的資本主義制度。所以有人認爲蘇聯對德國的目標，是想逐漸控制德國全部，以統一國家的美名去爭取德國人的同情。英美兩國也是希望德國統一的，但是不願意德國實行蘇聯的制度，致使蘇聯的勢力更進一步擴張闢來，結果控制了德國甚至歌洲全部。</p>
<p>所以要解決德國間題，實在極難找到　當的辦法，蘇聯和西方國家各有其自己的主張，同時大家還要把自己的主張推行到德國的全部去，這是問題的癥結所在·雙方各抱着懷疑對方的心理，所以大家都想爭取歐洲的支配權。</p>
<p>四强外長已經決定在本年底前討論德奧問題，究竟他們如何運用其智慧和魄力去解決這個對於歐洲前途最具有決定性的問題全世界人士都在拭目以待。（南）</p>

<p>上一星期，美國國務卿貝爾納斯在斯都伽特城，發表浪說，重中美國對德政策，引起國際上對於美蘇外交戰的種種揣測；而在這一星期中，美國商務部長華萊士又在紐約發表演說，主張美國外交政策有改絃易轍的必要，不僅在美國外交界引起軒然大波；而且在國際上，各國在五六天內，聽到兩種截然不同的論調，莫不驚惶失揹，尤其是有直接利書關係的英國，好像患了寒熱病，熱了一陣，又冷了一陣，幸虧杜魯門總統於十四日就發表了聲明，表示美國外交政策，迄無變更。這一塲軒然大波，始趨於平息，而各國也得以釋然於懷。</p>
<p>華氏演說親蘇反英</p>
<p>華萊士部長於十三日向美國左派市民政治行動委員會演說，其要點有四：（一）英國在近東採取帝國主義政策，蘇聯亦採取報復政策，足使美國捲入戰爭；美國非採取明朗的現實政策。即不能避免戰禍。（二）美國應以自已的眼光觀察世界政局，而不能以親英或親蘇的眼光出之；美人雖愛英人，但美國以英國爲其外交政策的基點，則屬錯誤。（三）美蘇兩國應劃分勢力範圍，互不千涉。（四）世界和平需要中國保持超然地位，無論在政治。或經濟上，均須處於兩大勢力範圍以外；但對於世界貿易，中國應開放門戶。</p>
<p>軒然大波已趨平息</p>
<p>華萊士以部長的資格，發表這種演說，在言論自由的美國，原不足重視。但是華氏是故總統羅斯福時代碩果僅存的部長，一向被人視爲親蘇份子，且有企岡恢復羅斯福政策的野心；何况華氏在演說之前，曾將演辭內容先請杜魯門總統核准，而事後杜魯門又公開表示，贊成華氏的演說。因此便引起美國外交界的軒然大波，國際輿論界也大受震動。因爲華氏的演說，不論在精神上或實質上，和貝爾納斯在德國發表的演說，匪特互相抵觸，而且背道而馳，所以貝氏遠在巴黎，聞及這個驚人消息，要「暴跳如雷」了，范登堡也說，『我不能同時聽命於兩個國務卿，』由此可見，美國外交政策已到了十字街口，何去何從？尙待杜魯門總統抉擇了。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統的聲明，終於在十四日發表了。他說：『余之初表，僅欲表明贊成華萊士部長發表此項演說之權利，但無意將此項演說作爲我國外交政策的聲明』。他又說：『我國政府旣定外交政策，迄無變更，且外交政策，非經總統與國務卿曁參衆兩院領袖討論，不能作任何重大變更』。於是因華氏演說所引起的軒然大波，也就趨於平息了。</p>
<p>巴黎和會又起風波</p>
<p>巴黎和會，預定在十月二十三日以前結束，各種委員會不得不加緊工作，最好都能在十月五日以前，完成任務。因此在盧森堡宮內的空氣，頓時緊張起來，英美兩國代表，也就乘此採取外交攻勢：（一）英美聲明放棄對義賠款要求；（二）反對保加利亞對希臘所提出之領土要求，並主張保國南陲的武裝。對保領土及政治委員會，十三日討論希臘對保國邊境所提出之修正案時，竟引起一塲風波，斯拉夫集團五國代表，未至終場，而相率退席。同時蘇聯外長莫洛托夫，又借題發揮，利用特里雅斯特港問題，對英美集團反攻。他在對義政治及領土委員會中發表演說，主張在特港設立『民主自治政府』；並諷刺英國政制不合世界潮流，英國對特港所提出的建議，與其施行於各殖民地者，並無不同。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫的演說發表後，巴黎和會又而臨到兩大難題：即（一）特里雅斯特港的地位問題；（二）保加利亞的邊界問題，有使和會破裂之虞；同時對於蘇聯和英美的關係，也將有重大的影響。</p>
<p>巴勒斯坦更恐怖了</p>
<p>巴勒斯坦因爲有猶太人的非法移殖，引起了軒然大波，使整個的迸東，也陷於動亂狀態之中。英國常局爲解決這個問題起見，特於本月十日在倫敦召開巴勒斯坦圓桌會議，邀請阿剌伯人與猶太人，聚首一堂，從容討論這個問題，俾能成立三方所能滿意的解決方案；殊不料在開幕的一天，阿猶兩族人民團體，都沒有代表出席，使巴勒斯坦會議，在悲觀消沉的空氣中揭幕。</p>
<p>在會塲巾，阿刺伯人反對猶太人在巴勒斯坦建國，又反對英國所提出的分治計劃，無形中已陷於僵局。同時在聖城，因爲猶太恐怖份子，在各地暴動，阿刺伯人於十四日罷市一天，以示抗議，巴勒斯坦局勢已進入新階段，過去猶阿兩族人互不侵犯，已有七年之久，而今此項休戰協定已被破壞無遺了。所以巴勒斯坦問題益趨複雜，使英國的政治外交家更要感覺到「頭痛」了。（九·一六）</p>

<h3>第一個飛行家</h3>
<p>— 溪譯</p>
<p>一來特一</p>
<p>發明第一架飛行機的來特兄弟之一奧維爾。來特（Orville　Wright），至今還生存着，今年七十五歲。能够親眼目賭他的發明物把世界改造成另一局面的大發明家，在美國歷史上恐怕只有來特一人了。</p>
<p>奧維爾。來特生長在一個幻想時代，那時孩子們劉覽着理想科學小說，夢想着空間飛船和飛箭。他和他的哥哥威爾寳·來特（Wilbur　Wright）接受了那幻想而演變成事實。他把華盛頓和東京間的距離縮成廿七小時半可以達到的短距離。他所發見的飛行秘訣，不但是今日的巨型飛機的基礎，更是未來的火箭飛船的基礎。</p>
<p>來特在孩提時代，對於機器就已發生興趣。他曾製浩風箏，　給他的朋友。十二歲時他開始對於印刷機發生興趣，十七歲時就造成了一架實用的印刷機。後來他又學製車床和脚踏車，成績都很美滿。</p>
<p>來特最初發動飛行的念頭，是在一八九六年患着傷寒臥在病榻上時。有一天他的哥哥帶進一張報紙，報吿他德國滑翔機專家李連德爾因滑翔機失事而殞命的消息。這觸動了來特的一種遐想，以爲李連德爾旣然死了，必得另有他人繼續他的事業。於是他便立定了潛心硏究飛行事業的決心。</p>
<p>來特兄弟開始涉獵一切有關飛行的書籍，一面硏讀，一面從事實騐。一九〇一年春，他們一切都已準備就緒，便開始作實地飛行。他們選擇北加羅林那州沿海沙灘作試騐塲所。他們把一隻雙翼滑翔機帶到「殺魔山」上，趁着順風騰空起飛，這樣一再試騐他們便學會了飛翔。他們越飛越遠，時間越長久。至此他們進一步在他們的雙翼機裏面加添一其變動機，幾經試騐，幾經改進，終於在一九〇三年十二月十七日那天，作引擎飛機的處女試飛，飛行了三十一哩，歷時五十一秒鐘。這消息在報上發表以後，並沒有引起人們的注意。他們竭力設法想得到政府的承認，但結果是失望。</p>
<p>他們改變方針，向歜洲去宣傳，居然得到歐洲人盛大的歡迎。各國政治家和皇族紛紛招待他們，宴請他們。英王愛德華和義王愛麥虞限親自觀賞他們飛行，德國王子堅請乘坐·他們的飛機，西班牙阿爾方朔王坐在飛機裏拍了一張照。他們在歐洲每一都城中公開表演飛行技術，到處受人慶賀，受人獎賞。當他們回到美國故鄕，那裏的同胞終於覺醒了，他們一連慶祝了兩天。</p>
<p>來特兄弟雖然在歐洲受到盛大的歡迎，但並不以此爲滿足，他們的宏願是欲美國陸軍部採用他們的飛機。他們不斷作種種試騐。每逢有新發明的航空機件加添進去，奧維爾。來特必定親自試騐。一九〇八年九月十七日終於發生了意外，那飛機在降落時突吿失事，另一飛機師當塲殞命，來特肋骨和股骨折斷了幾根，倖免於難。有一位朋友問他：「你的神經受影響嗎？」</p>
<p>來特似不解其言、反問道：「神經？你的意思是不是問我下次再敢飛行嗎？……我所唯一憂懼的倒是我的試騐恐怕年內不能够完成了。」</p>
<p>一九一二年威爾寳·來特患傷寒不治身死，奧維爾雖然繼續作飛行試騐一直到一九一五年，但是情形究竟不同了。他缺少了一個得力的助手；他是孤獨了。一九一四年第一次世界大戰爆發後，飛機突然從一種運動器且變成了一種殺人武器。常各種軍用飛機先後出現以後，來特的大名漸漸爲世人所遺忘了。</p>
<p>奧維爾。來特現在雖已七十五歲，但至今還沒有失去壯年時代淬勵奮發的那種堅毅的意志。他非常和　謙遜。雖曾獲得世界各國大學和學術團體的獎狀動章，可是他不喜歡向人誇耀。他不肯寫自傳，他的照片也難得在報紙上發見。</p>
<p>但是他的偉大的業績，世人是永遠不會遺忘的。已故羅斯福總統會經讚他說：「來特先生給與我們這些偉大的防禦利器—一種新的戰鬥力，一種新的和平保鐘。無疑的，他是美國當代的有數偉人之一。」</p>

<h3>友誼</h3>
<p>— 美国　O.Henry作　陶亮譯</p>
<p>是一條荒靜的街道上，一個剛上差的警士，尊嚴地走着，這種威嚴的姿態，並不是要顯給行人看的，他好像是養成了的習慣，因爲那時候，夜色已籠罩大地，並且不時還刮着寒風，與飄着一絲的細雨，雖然還沒有到宵禁的時分，可是街道上已尋不出一個人影了。</p>
<p>那警士用着各種純熟美妙的手法，揮舞着他的那根警棍，兩隻尖銳的眼睛，老是在各家店鋪住宅的門口，及幽靜的路上巡邏着，幾家專營夜市的商店，透露出微弱的燈光，其餘的幾乎都已打烊了，全靠手電筒看清遠處的景物。</p>
<p>突然，發現了一個魁梧的漢子，依靠在一家商店門口—一個黝黯的角落，於是那警士慢慢朝着那而走去，而那漢子也迎上來。</p>
<p>「警士，有什麽事情嗎」？他對警士搭訕着說到：「我不過是在這裏等待一個二十年前約定好的朋友，你不要以爲這是一件可笑的事，如果你不相信的話，我可以同你談談。在好多年前的以前，這兒本來不是一家「馬藍第」酒店嗎？……」</p>
<p>「不錯。」警士打斷了那漢子的話，岔上來說：「還是在五年前的春季，這爿酒店才收歇的呢？」</p>
<p>那漢子在警察回答時，擦着了一根火柴去點雪茄。在火柴光一閃的當兒，警士認清了他的面容，一個蒼白的臉，一雙小而黑的眼睛，在他的右肩眉旁邊，留着一條闊大的創疤，領帶上的那枝鑽石針，和一霎時的火柴光相映着。</p>
<p>「在二十年前的今晚。……」那漢子說：「我和齊美·彗而斯——他是我許多朋友中最好的一個——曾在這兒的「馬藍第」酒店中同餐過。……齊美和我的友誼，真好似如膠似漆一般，那時，我才十八歲，齊美大我兩歲，……第二天的早晨，我爲了生活，不得不離開紐約，到西部地方去，那時齊美始終不肯跟隨我，老是要逗留在紐約，所以那天分別時，二人就約定二十年後的今天，不論我倆的境況如何，孰貴孰賤；不論遠在北部西部。也要長途跋涉而來，雙方都不可失約。」</p>
<p>「咦！這倒有趣得很。」那個警士淡淡的說：「不過，依我看來，這好像太悠久了，二十年呢？……你現在可知道齊美·彗而斯德近況嗎？」</p>
<p>「這個——」那漢子顯然被問住了：「起先我們相互有信件往來，可是三年後，我倆的信息也隔絕了。……我知道齊美是一個守約的人，決不會不來的，除非他已死了。」说着，在袋中掏出一隻連錶蓋上都鑲着珠寶的挂錶。</p>
<p>「十點尚缺三分了。」那漢子說：「二十年前，我們分別的時候，正是在敲十點鐘吧！」</p>
<p>「你在西部地方，生活一定是舒適些。」</p>
<p>「比在紐約時，舒適得多多，我只願齊美能有有我一半的闊綽已夠了。……唉！他太缺少留險的精神了，滯留在紐約，生活反使他變得呆板了，若他能跟我去闖，也許會變成圓滑和勇敢了吧！」</p>
<p>警士揮動警棍，走了幾步，又回轉頭向那漢子說：「爲了職務上的關係，我先走了，希望你的朋友能及時趕到。再會吧！」</p>
<p>「我相信他會來的。再會了，朋友。」那漢子肯定的說：眼望那警士沿着人行道向前走了。</p>
<p>雨越下越大了，並且風勢也比本來加强了許多，那個爲了遵守信約—一個二十年前的約會，而不遠千里而來的漢子，依舊在商店的門口徘徊着，抽着雪茄耐心的等待着。</p>
<p>半個鐘點消逝了，方才有一個身材高大，穿着大衣的漢子，從對街奔了過來。</p>
<p>「卜潑，是你嗎？」那大漢懷疑地問了一聲。</p>
<p>「齊美。」他欣喜得高聲叫着，劃破了附近沉寂的氣氛。</p>
<p>「啊！」穿着大衣的漢子，握住了對方的手，「你的確是卜潑，我曉得只要存在世上，不會不來的。二十年確是個悠遠的日子……現在可惜那家酒店早已關閉了，否則我們不是又可以進去痛飲一頓了嗎？卜潑，西部給你的印象好嗎？」</p>
<p>「還好，在那兒我的慾望是滿足了。」他突然改變了話鋒：「齊美，我意想不到你會長得如此的高。」</p>
<p>「嗯！」</p>
<p>「齊美，你逗留在紐約，恐怕不甚得意吧！」</p>
<p>「的確，現在尚不過在市政廉中，擔任了一個小小的職務。……卜潑，我們還是談談別後的一切吧！」</p>
<p>他們二人興奮地走着，那等得心焦的朋友，因爲事業的發達吧！興奮的講述着他的成功，至於另一個却靜靜的聽着，一言不發。</p>
<p>當他們走過一個轉角處，公司裏的霓虹燈，射出刺目的光芒，兩人不由一齊注視着對方。</p>
<p>卜潑突然停止了前進，朝那穿大衣的漢子怒吼着。</p>
<p>「哼！你是不是齊美，二十年前的他，決不會像你這樣的醜陋。」</p>
<p>「朋友，且慢發怒，一個好人也會變成歹人的。」那人不得的說：「卜潑，你的事情，警察局中早已接到了芝加哥的電報，有命令叫你去一趟，現在還未到警察局之前，有一張巡邏警齊美·彗而斯託我帶給你的字樣。」</p>
<p>他展開了小紙條，臉色變得更加蒼白了，雙手也不由顫抖着。</p>
<p>那一張小字條上的句子並不多，字跡也很潦草，顯然是他臨時寫的。——</p>
<p>「卜潑：</p>
<p>你不要怪我失信，我來了很久了，就是當你在擦火柴時，我已明白了你是誰，爲了友誼，我不忍親手拘捕一個二十年前的摯友，而現在是緝拿的要犯，卜潑，我已託了一位便衣偵探來了結這件公事！</p>
<p>卜潑，你以爲我稱得上一聲朋友吧！齊美·彗而斯」</p>
<h3>板車夫的對話</h3>
<p>— 刀鋒刻</p>
<h3>中國現存最古的詩篇</h3>
<p>— 倉庚</p>
<p>文字在殷代的年，還在形成的過程中，出土的甲骨文已經證明了這一點。我們現在所能信任的最古的詩篇，是算那些呢？</p>
<p>尸子一書所載的帝堯之南風歌，和帝堯的卿雲詞，當然是無稽之談。列子載帝堯時的一篇童謠，更何況列子是晉任的僞託。所以可以說一切書籍所載的唐虞夏的詩篇，都是不可　信東西。</p>
<p>記得王任叔先生在文學讀本裏，舉禮記郊特牲裏的「蜡辭」爲第一篇古詩。辭曰：「土反其宅，水歸其緊，昆蟲無作，草木歸其宅。」根據詞句來看，確實有牠原始樸實的作風，且反映出古人崇拜物神之觀念。然而，禮記是漢代的書，故蜡辭是伊耆氏所作的話，也是不能成立，蜡辭至少是周時的作品。至於吳越春秋的黃帝斷竹歌，也無非是後人僞托而已。</p>
<p>所以有許多文學史家把周以前的現存的詩篇都一字不提，索性把詩經的三百篇奉爲中國詩歌的起源。因爲他們找不到比詩歌更早更可靠的詩篇。</p>
<p>其實，歌謠的發源和語言並行，當人類進步到能用文字記錄人事物的當兒，他們的言語也像歌謠似的帶着昔韻，所以記錄的文字，辭句，當時也帶着音韻的。從詩經最早幾篇的周頌裏，我們就能看到。周金散文似的詞句還是較周頌後來的東西。所以我們只要在最古的文物書本裏面就能找到我們中國最古的詩篇。</p>
<p>易經一書誰都認爲較詩經代而可靠的一部書，初輯成的年早當在殷末。在這部書裏，我們早能找到很完整的詩篇。如：</p>
<p>女承筐，</p>
<p>旡寶，</p>
<p>士刲羊，</p>
<p>旡血。</p>
<p>一幅多麼美麗的圖畫，詞句和音韻又是那麼嚴正和樸實。又有一首男女新婚時的戀詞。也非常完整—</p>
<p>在陰鶴鳴，</p>
<p>其子和之，</p>
<p>我有好爵，</p>
<p>吾與爾屍之！（　音波）</p>
<p>誰能說道二首詩篇較三百篇差麽？所以易經中的爻辭是中國現存最古的詩篇。</p>
<p>文學史和詩史應從易經爻辭寫起。</p>
<h3>惜餘春　（揚州續夢之一）</h3>
<p>— 洪爲法</p>
<p>十幾年前的事了。「惜餘春」，這是一個多麼典雅而又別致的名子，却給揚州教場北　一爿極小的茶社用着，總是一件夠人注意的事呀。</p>
<p>茶社的裏面，祗有三五張桌子，也祗有少數的老顧客每天在那裏，極悠閑的看報，吟詩，或者著棋。茶社的主人姓高，因爲生理上的缺陷，人都稱他高駝子。他聽到倒也泰然，因爲呼牛呼馬，在他看來，是沒有什麽榮辱在這裏面的，他一面管賬，一面又偷閒參加到一些老顧客的　體重去看報，吟詩，或者著棋。據說他已集好了許多詩稿，還沒有印出來問世，可是却也有名句傳誦於口，如「光陰似墨磨俱短，時事如棋刦更多」，這不是很　新的嗎？</p>
<p>這惜餘春裏面的陳設，都是古色古香。牆壁上除去一些字畫外，更有顧客們此唱彼和的詩稿，以及某某顧客徵詩，徵聯，以及徵求詩鐘的小啓。有時還張貼着徵求的結果，以及獎品分配的辦法。談到獎品，也很典雅而又別致。可以第一名是茶一壺，麵一碗，第二名是茶一壺，乾絲一碗，第三名是茶一壺，第四名以下是信封幾隻，信紙幾張。因此，這裏風雅的氣氛很是濃厚，那些著短衫肚裏缺少黑墨水的人們，都像自慚形穢的不敢走進去了。</p>
<p>在這惜餘春裏也可以有飯菜吃，還不都極簡單，祗是炒肉，燒豆腐之類。主人會代顧客們打算得很周到，不可做得多，也不可做得過好，恐怕顧客們喫不了，幷且花費太多。如是顧客們有什麽特殊的烹調方法，也可以親人庖廚，自行選材，自行製作。總之，主人總是站在顧客們一邊，十足的表示他自己不是惟利是圖的人，直似混跡朝市的大　。</p>
<p>主人原籍是福建人，可是寄居在揚州却已經很多年。他的叔父，據說在前清末年會在揚州府署裏做過房師。因爲批閱文字喜歡用肥大的點子，於是便得到高大點子得綽號。後來家裏也積聚了一些錢，幷且由這位惜餘春的主人高駝子，在教場開了一爿很大的麵館。這麵館呌可可居。韓愈送李愿歸盤谷序上不是說過嗎？「採於山，美可茹；釣於水，鮮可食」，這就是可可居取名的根據了。</p>
<p>高駝子開設了可可居以後，因爲他家裏原也是些筆耕的人，所以顧客中的文墨之士，每每受到特殊的優待。這該是惺惺相惜的意思。主人除了照料店務，就和這些文墨之士談詩篇論文，倒很閒雅。可惜這些文墨之士，多不是富有的人，每日品茶喫麵，大半記賬。日子久了，欠賬多，現金少，主人終於因此現金周轉不靈，沒法再撐，便祗有將可可居閉歇了。到了可可居閉歇以後，那些欠賬的文墨之士，自然有些過意不去，可是如要爲主人恢復原狀，又似乎力有未逮，便大家湊集了一些錢，由主人另外開設一爿小小的茶社。定名「惜餘春」，對於過去的可可居，實也懷着無限依戀的意思哩。</p>
<p>由可可居變成惜餘春，恰如從百花怒放的仲春，走向花事闌珊的春暮。惜餘春可愛惜，可是春光總要歸去的，這正象徵惜餘春的命運，在抗戰以前，隨着可可居又告閉歇了。唐人的詩歌裏說：「三月正當三十日，春光別我苦吟身；共君今夜不須睡，未到曉鐘猶是春」。想來愛慕風雅的高駝子當惜餘春閉歇時，會很容易的想念到這首詩，也有這首詩中所表現的情懷罷！</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　36</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「據事實的行跡上看，大概那位副隊長的護送貴賓的目標，已經達到；因爲有兩位戰地巡哨，已經指引他們回到原防，或是就近到豐台專車，豐台方面，當時因戰事吃緊，沒有人可以證明是否有貴賓到達，或是已經專車……」他皺起了眉尖，想到問題的棘手。</p>
<p>「那麼，也許是自動車失事，……」我放給他一條生路。</p>
<p>「對！」他就着我的口風，想把事件含糊了結。「聽說那位副隊長，曾經吃了過量的酒……失事的事，似乎有些必然性……？」</p>
<p>這倒出乎意料之外的一件事，做夢也沒想到會有這樣湊巧的一個機會給我利用。我心下私自慶幸，一方面打定了主意，叫這傢伙陪我上長辛店去一遭。</p>
<p>事情很順利地進行着：這傢伙一路很巴結的陪伴我，先到出事地點去偵察一番。沿路可說一無障礙；所有哨崗，巡哨，都知道我們是辦理意外案件的專員。我把他掇弄到平漢和平盧路交口不遠的三角地帶，就說：還有其他使命，請他自便，安心等我的電話。這傢伙設非碰到這件糟心的事，弄得他神不守舍，確實沒有這樣容易對付哩。爲了要了結這件無頭公案，第二天打了一個電話給他，叫他用自働車失事的說法，把公案結束呈報，我趁此也了却一件心事。</p>
<p>總計從離開長辛店，又回到長辛店，一共是整整三十六小時，其中僅有五小時的睡眠，其餘都是一些耗費體力和傷腦筋的事情，幾次驚險還不在內，所以感覺十二分疲倦。</p>
<p>然而心念記的，還是鶴見的行蹤。〇四號給我一豐電訊記事底稿，其中祗有一條是鶴見的消息，還是從天津分站發出的，當然沒有十分重要。其餘電訊中可以注意的，乃是關於宋哲元得態度和秦德純的表示，還有一條是關於張自忠的行動。</p>
<p>就這些電訊大體上說，宋哲元是單獨一種行動，也許是眼光不到，也許是另有用心。其餘如秦德純，張自忠，王冷齊，吉星文等，却是一致，然而又沒有顯明的聯合一致行動。這一點不能不歸咎於宋哲元一門心思，夢想着一種不合邏輯的和平方案。「既不能令，又不受命，」大概是他這種態度的考語。</p>
<p>第二天一大早，我還躺在床上，〇四號九來請示，說是吳工程師急於要見我一次，並說昨天已經來過兩次，看樣子是有相當嚴重的問題，亦和我討論。我因同他是北平老同學，又有相當交情，立刻便到客室裏去接見。</p>
<p>「您可回來了，可沒把我急壞！」吳工程師劈頭就是這麼一個警句。</p>
<p>「噢，」我保持着相當的鎮靜，一時還想不到有什麽事，讓他替我着急。</p>
<p>「瞧，」他滿面愁容的繼續說，好像怨我做錯了事似的「像您這樣光杆兒一個，當然沒有關係；我可是全家老小，生命財產，都在這裏，您也得替我想想哪！」</p>
<p>「怎麼說？」我給他這兩句無頭無腦的話，曚得莫名其妙，「有什麽事嗎？……咱們大家想想辦法得哪。」</p>
<p>「瞧，可見愈是天下太平，「天塌下來，還有屋脊　架住。」我說，老大哥，您得給我一個主意。」</p>
<p>吳工程師叫鼎元，在北平念完中學，後來進香港大學，專攻電機工程。人是相當漂亮聰明，可惜沒有時運。香港畢業，工程師挨不到他身上，只好在北平一個窮大學裏，當着一名數學教授，混混飯吃。好容易混到平漢路裏，當了一名副工程師，聽說還費了九牛二虎之力，走了很多門路，才弄到這們一個位置，偏巧又碰到一個最「不景氣」的時局，災官滿天飛，路局窮得買不起煤，成年的不發薪水。</p>

<h3>九一八</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>「九一八」這三個字，在所有的中國人腦筋中印象最深刻，雖然那個日子遠較一二八，八一三，以及七七爲早。</p>
<p>那位無名氏所作的一首歌曲，也幫助我們對這個日子所發生的一切慘痛事實時時湧現心頭。抗戰勝利了，我們，特別是東九省七千萬同胞，歡欣鼓舞，幾乎發狂，不幸得很，舊的九一八湔除，然而東北今日是什麼局面呢？</p>
<p>從去年九月開始，整整一年中，東北同胞過的是什麼生活，敵僑俘還沒有遣散完畢，什麼人在乘火打劫，什麼人在伺隙盤踞，我們大家心頭都雪亮。</p>
<p>我有不和東北朋友，老實說，我從他們的性格和生活行爲，我敢斷定東北的受難，衹是很短時期內的事。因爲他們都堅毅「，明是非，對於前途都很樂觀，并且信仰政府。</p>
<p>有人將東北比作遠東的火藥庫，從地理的形勢上來說，它的未來地位確實非常重要，東北人的責任固然重，政府是更不會等閒視之的。我們的國防線在東北，不僅僅是一句口號，是需要我們腳踏實地來完成這一使命的。</p>
<p>今日，我願意請大家把眼光注視到長白山鴨綠江去！</p>
<h3>痛定思痛　我們的東北</h3>
<p>東北是亞洲的寶藏，中國的生命線。請看她的物產富源：</p>
<p>大豆——產量佔全世界百分之六十五，價值佔我國出口總值百分之二十三。</p>
<p>森林——約二十五萬萬公畝，佔全國四分之一。</p>
<p>鐵路——約六千五百英里，佔全國二分之一強。</p>
<p>產——金，石油，鐵產量佔全國二分之一以上，煤佔全國產量五分之二。</p>
<p>耕地——熟田一萬五千餘萬英畝，可耕地三萬九千餘萬英畝。</p>

<p>新聞人物</p>
<h3>單身漢胡宗南　天下無易事，天下亦無難事！</h3>
<p>— 佑芙</p>
<p>廿二年的奮鬦，胡宗南將軍不僅是有名的典型將領，而且，在黃埔出身中，他是獨一無二的傑出人才。從第一期以下各期同學，幾無一人及得上他。（按第一期除胡以外沒有一個人任懷念長官與掛上將銜的）。</p>
<p>胡氏浙江孝豐人，南京高等師範肄業後，因憤恨國內政治黑暗，立志參加革命，遂決心投考黃埔。</p>
<p>怎樣考進黃埔</p>
<p>想當年胡氏投考黃埔，曾有一段趣事；胡氏因體格瘦弱，年齡已是卅開外，故初初報名，校方一再不允，後經其苦求，始得准予報名，參予考試；又因成績太差，名落孫山。胡氏異常苦楚。旋親見教育長王柏齡將軍，請求准許入學，王將軍因覺其志可嘉，乃勉強破格許他入學。</p>
<p>豈知胡氏天資較差，同學中多半廿歲左右之青年，比他聰敏，非胡氏中年之頭腦所能趕得上。於是，胡氏成爲第一期全體同學中最笨的一個；不僅是笨，平時精神也極衰頹，上課不僅時常打瞌睡，結果，弄得教官與同學都對他頭痛，一致認爲他不堪造就！</p>
<p>畢業時舉行考試，胡氏亦無法應付，教官原諒他的痛苦，遂將所有之功課集中起來出一個題目，叫胡氏解答。當時教官問胡氏：「你入黃埔所學的心得是什麼？」答對了就畢業，答不對不能畢業。胡氏馬上回答教官：「集中兵力於要點而發揮之。」教官很滿意他富有戰術思想，即準予他畢業了；想不到後來，胡氏在每當一次戰役中，都運用了這句話，因而獲得無限的戰果。安內時期，紅軍聽到「胡宗南」三個字，簡直嚇得無可形容，所以只要碰到胡宗南的第一師，共軍立刻退卻。在共方所誇耀宣傳的二萬五千里長征中，胡宗南跟蹤追擊，弄得共軍無路可走，終於活活的凍死在冰天雪地裏，以及給邊疆苗人吃掉的不計其數；一直到今天，即是共方軍隊對胡將軍的部隊戰術，也很欽佩。這也許就是他慣用當年畢業考試的那一句話所使然。</p>
<p>保衛武漢之役</p>
<p>「八一三」爆發，胡氏曾一度奉調來滬，松滬失守後，在保衛大武漢戰鬦中，胡氏統率所部駐守信陽，使敵難越雷池一步。</p>
<p>後來，他轉調西安，負起保衛大西北的使命。八年來，他一直率領數十萬大軍坐鎮西北，使敵人無法得逞一步。西北的老百姓都稱胡將軍爲「人民的褓姆」。</p>
<p>胡氏不僅拱衛西北，而且還創辦之一個軍事學府，那就是第七分校。由他自兼主任，造就了許多下級幹部，使西北龐大的部隊，不感到下級幹部的恐慌。</p>
<p>他不需要太太</p>
<p>胡氏今日之地位雖高，但還是單身漢；他似乎不喜歡親近女性；關於他的婚姻問題，許多人都問過他，他的回答是「畢生以事業爲中心。」然而，有一次，他到重慶參加集團軍總司令以上的會議，那時蔣夫人正爲孔二小姐物色對象無著，因而看中了胡氏，託人向胡宗南說明此意，但胡氏也婉辭謝絕了！所以，胡氏到現在還沒有太太。這也許是他事業能以迅速發展的因素，然，胡氏並不因此而苦惱，相反的，他能專心於事業；在胡將軍的一生中，他始終堅持著一個思想「以身許國」！</p>
<p>回憶當年投考黃埔與求學時代，任何一個人也不敢相信胡宗南曾有今日，即已死的王柏齡將軍當時亦不敢如是預料，但事實證明，胡宗南將軍是黃埔首屈一指的健將！這就是：「人不可以面相，海水不可用斗量」，「天下無易事，天下亦無難事！」只看你怎麼樣去做罷了！</p>
<h3>餓死無罪一幕活劇</h3>
<p>地點：在一警察局內</p>
<p>人物：警察一，女犯一，審問官一。</p>
<p>警察：（立下作敬禮狀）「報告，有一女犯搶東西。」</p>
<p>審官問「你爲什麼搶別人家的東西？」</p>
<p>女犯：「因爲肚子餓；老爺？實在是有幾天沒吃了」！</p>
<p>官：「你爲什麼不去幹那別的生意呢？」</p>
<p>犯：「老爺，實在不瞞你說，小的是日裏找，夜裏找，連夢中也找，而還是找不到，老爺可憐可憐小人吧丫代爲介紹一些事情！小人什麼都肯幹」！</p>
<p>官：「唔那你以前是幹什麼的」？</p>
<p>犯：「我以前是做野雞的，本來是爲了生活逼迫而做的；想不到近來沒的執照不能做了」！</p>
<p>官：「那你爲什麼不去領執照呢」？</p>
<p>犯：「是，老爺但是領執照要錢，要騐血，我沒有錢，衹有毒」！</p>
<p>官：「你沒有親戚朋友嗎」？</p>
<p>犯：「朋友親戚是有的但是現在我窮了他們一概不認得我了」！</p>
<p>犯：「老爺，搶人家的東西是犯法的」？</p>
<p>官：「當然咾」！</p>
<p>犯：「那末，自殺可是犯法的」？</p>
<p>官：「自殺也是犯法的！傷害罪」！</p>
<p>犯：「那末餓死呢」？</p>
<p>官：「唔……唔……非然」　—完—</p>
<p>（編者按：餓死無罪）</p>
<h3>提倡國貨　冒充洋貨</h3>
<p>— 王文梏</p>
<p>法國堵德在最後一課中曾經沈痛院說：「請大家不要忘了祖國的文字，將來總有反身的日子。」</p>
<p>敵人控制我們八年，而結果勝利屬於我們，這不能不說是，因爲敵人控制不住我們的靈魂——文字。</p>
<p>前些日子，報上見過：「海關上公文，將逐漸改用國文了。」這就是表示國家已覺悟到，我們必須尊重自己的文字。</p>
<p>然而，目前我們一面提倡國貨，一百卻連道地的國貨香煙——白蘭地，美麗。黃金龍，樂華，領事……在煙價上不容易找到一兩個中國字。</p>
<p>十足是國產貨品—三羊牌熱水瓶，ADK雨衣罷維雅發油，富樂色襯衫，在外表上都不易找到自己的文字，有之，也只是做了洋文的譯名。</p>
<p>一面是提倡國貨，一面卻叫國人認清：「BHK雨衣，MADE　IN　CHINA。」</p>
<p>一面是冒充洋貨，一面是叫人必須愛用國貨。真會我們這羣消費者無所適從！</p>
<p>雜談</p>
<h3>剩餘物資</h3>
<p>— 楊謀</p>
<p>最近本市公教人員，蒙物資供應局的垂青，配給了一些食物，據說這批食物，原是美軍的剩餘物資轉移我國者，公教人員有此口福，也頗自幸的了。</p>
<p>這次配給的東西，計DK二種，每種共九份，而內中又分見早中晚三餐，因此換句話說。共配給三天的食糧，所化代價，計共九千元。食糧的內容，有香煙餅干咖啡罐頭等，尚相當豐富，雖然外傳有發霉情形，但因此批物資，有係一九四〇年者，而最近者也有一九四五年者，故頗有不同，大體說來，尚屬完好。</p>
<p>這批東西，當然不能說貴。但是三天的食糧，化九千元，即使能常有這批廉價東西供應，一月共需九萬元，如一家僅以二口計算，亦需十八萬元，則公教人員之不足此待遇者，比比皆是，而公教人員之吃這批剩餘物資，亦不能不說是「高攀」。</p>
<p>美國軍隊不要了的食物，而我們公教人員尚有「吃不起」之感，這其間的距離，未免太遠了。并且也畢竟太爲我們公教人中叫屈。</p>
<p>可是，靠了美軍的福，公教人員總算能嘗到一點廉價的美國味，可不已是大大的徼幸了麼？</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 17th] The battle near Huaiyin, the heartland of the Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu, after the National Army recovered several strongholds on the evening of the 15th, reached the outskirts of Huaiyin City, twenty li away, on the 16th. According to reliable sources, the National Army entered Huaiyin City on the night of the 16th, and the Communist Army's 1st Column was annihilated by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 17th] After the National Army recovered Siyang, the New Fourth Army and the Ninth Column of the Communist Army in Huaiyin repeatedly attacked the National Army, attempting to retake Siyang. To eliminate the threat, the National Army captured strongholds such as Keyangjia Town, Taojiakai, Zhuji, and Chenjiaji on the 15th, and recovered Huaiyin County on the morning of the 17th at twelve o'clock.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Taixian, 17th] After the elite troops of the National Army advanced directly towards Huaiyin, the Communist Army's rear organizations in that area retreated towards Funing. Communist troops in the Dongtai, Xinghua, and Yancheng areas hastily built fortifications overnight.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Taixian, 17th] The Communist troops between Haian and Baimi, seeing the failure of the siege of Haian and in order to reinforce the northern front, are now withdrawing northwards in large numbers.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Taixian, 17th] According to a telephone call from Yangzhou, the Communist Army's Su Yu unit has arrived at Fanchuan, attempting to halt the National Army's counterattack.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Taixian, 17th] It has been learned that a certain unit of the National Army, after opening the Ruhai Line, is now turning its troops westward, pressing towards Hujiaji. This location is an important stronghold between Haian and Qutang.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Taixian, 17th] Reliable information: The National Army in Qintong is advancing towards the Shagangzi area. The National Army in Meiyan stationed troops in Tangjiazhuang yesterday. This location is southeast of Qintong and approximately ten li away from Shagangzi.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Taixian, 17th] According to a person from Dongtai: The Communist Army is now vigorously implementing "distribution of goods" and "distribution of property" campaigns. Even scattered pieces of furniture are being distributed, causing the people to suffer unspeakable hardships. The town of Libao has been devastated by several battles and the trampling of the Communist Army. Not a single person remains in the town, and the buildings have been almost completely destroyed, turning it into a dead town.</p>
<h3>Communist Army in Zhangjiakou Engaged in Evacuation; National Army Reaches Suburbs of Fengzhen; Communist Army Besieged in Datong Demoralized</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Tianjin, 17th] The situation in the northern theater is gradually becoming clearer. Datong in Northern Shanxi is loosening, Xinxian has been relieved, and the Communist Army in Central Shanxi has no opportunity for large-scale actions. Eleven counties in Eastern Hebei have been successively recovered, and the National Army in Central Hebei is expanding its operations. It is reported that the threat to the Beining Line has decreased, and both the PingSui and PingGu lines are being repaired. The full opening of the Jinpu Railway is also expected.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 17th] A military observer stated that after the National Army in Eastern Suiyuan advanced and stationed in Jining, they are now engaged in mopping up the remnants of the Communist Army, consolidating the outer defenses, and reorganizing and replenishing their forces. They are unlikely to immediately attack Fengzhen. A portion of the Communist Army from Datong was transferred to Fengzhen, but the siege has not been lifted. The Communist Army in Zhangjiakou is currently engaged in evacuation work. The railway between Xianmiao Village and Zhangjiakou has been destroyed. The Communist Army knows it cannot hold out and will likely withdraw from Zhangjiakou on its own.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 17th] According to related sources, the troops of Fu Zuoyi who recovered Jining and continued south have advanced to a point twenty li north of Fengzhen. The Communist Army is drawing troops from Datong to reinforce Fengzhen, attempting to hold it and prevent the National Army from relieving the siege of Datong. On the other hand, reinforcements are being transported from Yanggao to Datong in large numbers using carts and automobiles, totaling approximately ten thousand men. However, their strength has been greatly reduced, and their morale is far lower than before.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 17th] The National Army advancing south from Jining has now defeated the Communist Army. As of the 17th, the vanguard of the National Army has advanced to Wumitu (ten kilometers east of Wulishan). The Communist Army fleeing south was intercepted into several sections by the National Army advancing east along the south of the PingSui Railway, suffering heavy casualties. It is reported that a larger-scale battle may occur in the section from Jining south to Fengzhen north, because if the National Army can pass Fengzhen, the Communist Army will have no defenses to rely on. Therefore, the Communist Army will firmly defend [ ], in order to resist stubbornly.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, GuiSui, 17th] The National Army that recovered Jining continued to advance south along the PingSui Railway. On the 15th, it recovered Suji, twenty kilometers south of Jining. The vanguard has also reached Mamitu. The Communist Army there is retreating towards Fengzhen.

<h3>Situation in Northeast China Outwardly Relaxed, Inwardly Tense; Heavy Atmosphere of War on the Songhua River; Communist Army Building Base in Jiamusi</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 17th] The entire Northeast has been in an explosive state of silence for the past few weeks. The next phase of the war is expected to occur at the crossing of the Songhua River. Du Yuming's troops do not seem to intend to delve deeply into the Communist Army's area. Instead, they intend to use the time to consolidate the transportation corridor between Shenyang and Changchun. There are still a considerable number of Communist troops in the southeast of Liaoning and south of the Songhua River, occupying isolated areas, but these elements, which only have a harassing effect, are no longer a major threat.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tianjin, 16th] Sources in the North China government have learned that the Communist Army in the Northeast is establishing a large-scale operational base in Jiamusi, on the south bank of the Songhua River, 150 miles northeast of Harbin. Over the past few days, war materiel transported from Harbin to that location includes forty Japanese-made tanks and twenty damaged Japanese aircraft. These aircraft will be repaired by Japanese technicians. Jiamusi also has a mechanized unit training school, headed by a Japanese instructor. The Harbin authorities have instructed residents to donate cotton for the Communist Army to make cotton clothes. Pro-government sources also stated that the movement of the Communist Army in the Northeast is aimed at concentrating on Anshan, Haitong (transliteration), Taolaizhao, Lafa, and Faku, to correspond with the Communist Army outside the Northeast. These Communist troops will adopt guerrilla tactics against the National Army. It is also learned that the Communist Party in the Northeast is forcing the people to hold meetings and implementing liberation movements.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Will Host Reporters Today</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 17th] After Foreign Minister Wang Shijie returned to Nanjing, he scheduled a tea reception for reporters at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 5:00 PM on the 18th to report on his participation in the peace conference.</p>
<h3>Re-division of Northeastern Provincial Boundaries Has Concrete Results</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 17th] It is reported that the re-division of the boundaries of the nine provinces in the Northeast has yielded concrete results. The Topographical Department of the Ministry of Interior has already produced a blueprint of the new provincial boundaries. This matter will be officially announced once it is approved by the Executive Yuan. It is said that the reasons for the re-division are divided into two points: (1) After the re-division, some of the previously overly impoverished provinces, such as Andong and Liaobei, will be joined with some prosperous areas to make the economic capacity of the nine provinces approximately equal; (2) In the past, most of the provincial capitals of the nine provinces were on the Central Changchun Railway Line, which seems inappropriate from the current military and political perspectives.</p>
<h3>Zhang Jia'ao and Others Inspect Xiaofengman Power Plant</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yongji, 17th] Zhang Jia'ao and Chairman Yang Jian went to inspect the Xiaofengman Hydropower Plant on the 17th.

The wartime excess profits tax has been abolished and replaced by a special profits tax, with the tax rate increased from 20% to 60%. Income tax on civil servants will be levied on a progressive basis.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 17th] The Ministry of Finance's Tax Administration will reduce its organization starting next month, abolishing eight goods tax bureaus.

<h3>Public Education Personnel in the Capital</h3>
<p>Will Be Allotted Woolen Uniform Fabric</p>

Various agencies are actively preparing. It has been learned that the Ministry of Economics has decided to first allot each public education employee in the capital a piece of woolen uniform fabric, which can be distributed before winter. The allotment price will be calculated at the lowest cost. The ministry is currently counting the number of public education personnel in Nanjing. If the supply of wool is smooth, it plans to allot it to public education personnel in Shanghai. The Ministry of Economics is also planning the use of coal by various agencies this winter. If there is a surplus of coal distributed to various agencies, it will also be allotted to public education personnel. However, the distribution will be prioritized, with those who have dependents being given priority. The detailed measures are also being drafted by the ministry.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 17th] The supply of various daily necessities to civil servants in this city has been agreed upon by the Nanjing Office of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Area Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau and the Cooperative Affairs Administration of the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the National Cooperative Goods Supply Office, which will allocate and distribute supplies from seized materials.</p>

Semi-official figures also speculate that the opening of the PingSui, Jinpu, and PingHan Railways will happen soon. There are rumors in Beiping that troops will be increased in Tianjin, and that the Third Army will be transferred to Beiping. The fact that Gao Guizi came to Beiping with Chen Cheng has also attracted much attention from the press.

<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 17th] After Cai Wenzhi, Chief of Staff of the Government of the Military Mediation Department, traveled back and forth between Nanjing, Shanghai, and Guling, he returned to Beiping yesterday. Today, he met with reporters and said that the rumors that the Military Mediation Department would close down due to the deterioration of the situation are absolutely inaccurate. The central government's efforts for peace have not been relaxed at all. This time, he reported to the Chairman, who had high expectations. Although the spread of war has overshadowed the glory of mediation, the Military Mediation Department has its own future.</p>

<h3>Daughter of Traitor Wang Yitang Petitions for Retrial for Her Father</h3>
<p>Death of Traitor Lin Bosheng Imminent</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 17th] After the top traitor in North China, Wang Yitang, was sentenced to death, the judgment has now been delivered, recounting Wang's major crimes during his tenure as Chairman of the Puppet Provisional Government and the Puppet North China Political Affairs Commission, stating that he "held important positions early in his career, but did not cherish his reputation, seizing opportunities to rise, his crimes are obvious, and he should be sentenced to the death penalty." However, Wang's daughters, Shuzhen and Huizhen, and their appointed lawyer have petitioned for a retrial for Wang, saying that Wang was unable to defend himself during the trial due to illness, so he could not be directly sentenced according to Article 297 of the Criminal Procedure Law. They also said that Wang resigned as Chairman of the Committee before June 1, 1944, and should be given a reduced sentence. Although he later served as a puppet advisor, Jin Yunpeng was not prosecuted, etc. However, it is generally believed that Wang's daughter's petition for a retrial is mainly to delay the execution time, hoping that Wang will die of illness in prison. Wang has been eating and drinking less since hearing the death sentence, attempting to hasten his death before the execution. The prison authorities have taken strict precautions against his suicide.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 17th] After traitor Lin Bosheng was sentenced to death, his wife, Xu Ying, petitioned for a retrial. On the 17th, the High Court ruled that the application for a retrial was rejected. Lin's death is imminent.</p>
<h3>Five Major Traitors, Including Zhou Fohai, Ding Mocun, and Luo Junqiang, Brought Countless Treasures; Luggage Reached Hundreds of Pieces</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 17th] In addition to traitor Zhou Fohai, traitor Ding Mocun, and traitor Luo Junqiang, the two other major traitors who were escorted to Nanjing on the 16th are Ma Jiliang (Chief of General Affairs of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank) and Yang Qiuhua (Director of the Grain Affairs Department of the Puppet Ministry of Finance, who is the brother-in-law of Zhou Fohai's wife). It is also learned that Ma's wife also accompanied him. After being taken into custody last night, responsible personnel interrogated them separately. Zhou was shaking a cattail leaf fan, behaving calmly, and even smiling foolishly from time to time. It was also heard that at 11:30 PM, he was still claiming to be hungry, telling the warden that he wanted to order a banquet from a restaurant for dinner, which was rejected by the prison authorities. Only after repeated requests was he allowed to buy a bowl of beef noodles for each person. After adjustments, Luo, Ma, and Yang were in one room, and Zhou and Ding were in one room, all with small iron beds and brocade bedding. It was also heard that they brought hundreds of pieces of luggage, and the responsible personnel finished cleaning up at 3:00 AM. The property was extremely abundant, with countless gold bars and gold ingots. Those who saw it said that this was the fat of the land of the occupied areas. The military authorities responsible for escorting the traitors contacted the Capital High Court on the morning of the 17th to transfer the procedures, which will be completed within days.</p>
<h3>Chairman Changed Weekend Trip to Jiangxi; Will Return to Xikou for Sixtieth Birthday Celebration</h3>
<p>Changchun Citizens Presented a Book of Names Titled "Gratitude" to Madame Chiang</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Guling, 17th] According to reliable sources, Chairman Chiang decided to leave Guling with his wife on the 21st. After leaving Mount Lu, the Chairman will travel by car to Nanchang to inspect, while Madame Chiang will take a plane with Marshal Ma's couple and Song Ziliang back to Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Guling, 17th] October 30th of this year is the nationally designated sixtieth birthday celebration of Chairman Chiang. The Chairman's lunar birthday is September 25th (October 19th in the Gregorian calendar this year). It is reported that the Chairman will go to his hometown of Xikou at that time.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 17th] Hundreds of thousands of Changchun citizens, in order to express their gratitude to Madame Chiang for her concern for the suffering of the people and for raising relief funds, are presenting a "Book of Names of Gratitude" on silk, six zhang long and one chi five cun wide, with paper scrolls inlaid and containing the signatures of over 30,000 people. Mayor Zhao Junmai has been entrusted to present it on his trip to Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Guling, 17th] Special Envoy Marshall left Guling and returned to Nanjing at 1:20 PM on the 17th. Before leaving, he went to the headquarters to visit the Chairman and left after talking for less than ten minutes. Marshal Ma is scheduled to return to Guling on the 20th and accompany his wife and Madame Chiang back to Nanjing on the 21st.</p>
<h3>Situation at a Decisive Turning Point; Special Envoy Marshall Returned to Nanjing from Guling Yesterday; Met with the Ambassador at His Residence That Evening</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 17th] Special Envoy Marshall returned to Nanjing from Guling at 5:30 PM on the 17th, accompanied by an American woman with many pieces of luggage. When reporters interviewed Mr. Marshall about his meeting with the Chairman after he got off the plane, Mr. Marshall did not answer as usual. Then, when reporters inquired about his wife's recent situation, he replied "Very good, thank you" and told them that his wife would have to wait until next week to return to Nanjing. It is learned that Madame Marshall was originally scheduled to return to Nanjing today, but she delayed her return until next week due to Madame Chiang's firm request for her to stay. After Mr. Marshall returned to his residence, Ambassador Stuart went to meet him at 7:00 PM. [Fu] Jingbo also went there half an hour later.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 17th] The future of peace talks has now reached a critical and delicate stage. In the past few days, the general public has hoped that Special Envoy Marshall's return to Nanjing will bring some good news. At the same time, they further hope that the Chairman will return to Nanjing as soon as possible so that the problem negotiations do not have to go back and forth. However, Zhou Enlai went to Shanghai again yesterday on the pretext of "the masses" and Wang Bingnan said that he would not return to Nanjing until the military three-person conference was convened. From this sign, Zhou is very likely to be avoiding the issue. Therefore, the future of peace negotiations is difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 17th] After Zhou Enlai went to Shanghai, Wang Bingnan from the Communist Party side went out to make courtesy visits. At 11:00 AM on the 17th, Wang visited Fu Jingbo and talked for one hour. It is reported that the content of the talks still insisted on convening a military three-person group meeting, but Ambassador Stuart, who is in the middle, still did not give up the informal five-person group meeting to solve the problem politically.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 17th] Communist Party spokesman Wang Bingnan said that if Special Envoy Marshall returns to Nanjing from Guling and cannot bring back the government's written reply accepting the Communist Party's restoration of the three-person group meeting, there will be no reason for negotiations. Therefore, after Communist Party representative Zhou Enlai goes to Shanghai today, there is no need to return to Nanjing. At the same time, we have not received any assistance from the Soviet Union and will continue to do so in the future. In short, Special Envoy Marshall's return to Nanjing from Guling this time has almost reached the final decision point.</p>
<h3>My Decision to Establish Governance in Kowloon City: Special Envoy Guo Negotiated with the Governor of Hong Kong; Director He of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Clarifies Our Stance</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 16th] The Bao'an County Government of Guangdong, regarding the establishment of governance rights in Kowloon City, after seeking instructions from the Special Envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi, has replied in accordance with the 1898 Beijing Treaty, that the establishment of governance in Kowloon City is feasible and is currently being planned. The Hong Kong government issued a statement on the 14th denying Chinese sovereignty over Kowloon City, which has caused some who are not familiar with the contents of the treaty to question the governance rights of Kowloon City. Guo Dehua, Special Envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi, met with the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Alexander Grantham, on the afternoon of the 16th, stating that the Chinese government will not abandon its treaty rights and that the governance of Kowloon City is in progress. According to the 1898 Beijing Treaty, China and Britain agreed to a 99-year lease of the New Territories, but the treaty stipulated that Chinese officials could reside in Kowloon City, without hindering the British military defense of Hong Kong, and exercise governance rights. The conditions also stipulated that Chinese officials and warships could travel and dock in the Kowloon pier area. In 1899, due to the armed resistance of the villagers of the "New Territories" against the British military police taking over land and property, the Chinese officers and soldiers stationed in Kowloon City were expelled, but the rights were not actually lost.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] He Fengshan, Director of the Information Department and Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, met with reporters today and answered their questions regarding a report that the Hong Kong government spokesperson recently made a statement denying that the area within Kowloon City is still Chinese territory and that China is currently exercising governance rights in the area. The spokesperson clarified our position, which is recorded below: Question: According to the Hong Kong government spokesperson, "The governance rights of Chinese officials in Kowloon City were terminated in 1899 due to conflicts with British military needs." Is this true? Answer: The Sino-British Convention Respecting an Extension of Hong Kong Territory of 1898 states: "The Chinese officials now stationed in Kowloon City shall continue to exercise jurisdiction there, but shall not interfere with the military requirements for the defense of Hong Kong." Since the agreement stipulates that Chinese officials can continue to exercise jurisdiction in the city, our country will certainly send officials there, because we have never abandoned our governance rights in Kowloon City. Question: Are there any differences between the two sides regarding the interpretation of this treaty? Answer: If there are differences in the interpretation of the treaty between the two sides, then in accordance with international law, it should be interpreted in favor of the country bearing the obligation, and our country is the country bearing the obligation in the 1898 Sino-British Lease of Kowloon Treaty.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 17th] At a time when Chinese fishermen in Hong Kong are being oppressed by the Hong Kong government and sending representatives to Guangzhou to appeal, the Hong Kong government has again announced the encroachment on the governance rights of Kowloon City, which has aroused serious attention among people here. The Dagong Bao today published an article titled "Another Unwise Move by the Hong Kong Government," severely criticizing British colonial policy, saying: They have not considered China's post-war status, nor do they recognize the friendly relations between China and Britain, and they often introduce unpleasant incidents. The article emphasized that this move has aroused great anger among the Chinese people and that China will no longer be fooled by colonial policies.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 17th] Local officials have not commented on today's news from the China Mail, which said: The Chinese government does not want to give up any treaty rights in Kowloon and wants to rebuild Chinese judicial power in Kowloon as soon as possible. The report said that "reliable Chinese sources" said that Guo Dehua, the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Special Envoy in Guangdong and Guangxi, on behalf of the Chinese government, wrote to the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Alexander Grantham, on this matter as the main theme.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] British Ambassador to China, Sir Horace Seymour, stated in a firm tone when he met with reporters on the 17th that the Hong Kong government's statement on the Kowloon sovereignty issue was "absolutely accurate!" However, he said that he himself was not very familiar with early history. The British ambassador had just returned from Shanghai and was very impressed with Shanghai. Despite a week of busy socializing, he showed no signs of fatigue. It is said that the British commercial inspection delegation will arrive in China in the coming days and will visit various places. Negotiations on the Sino-British trade agreement may also begin in the short term.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Sir Horace Seymour paid his first official visit to Minister Wang Shijie at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 5:00 PM on the 17th.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Have Submitted All Duplicate Copies of the Inventory of Received Goods, and Have Sent Copies to General MacArthur's Headquarters for Review</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The inspection and acceptance situation in various places is tense. Most of the original inventories are hidden and not handed over. It is reported that the Japanese side has another duplicate copy and has sent all five boxes to the authorities, which will be used for inspection.

<h3>The Government Should Build More Barracks to Promote Military-Civilian Relations</h3>
<p>Yu Nanqiu's Talk After Returning from the Inspection</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Hankou, 17th] Yu Nanqiu, the leader of the third group of the inspection team in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, recently spoke to reporters about his experiences and impressions of the inspection in Jiangxi. He said that one-third of the cases reported in Jiangxi this time were housing disputes, and most of them were occupied by the military and warehouses. For example, the Jiangxi Provincial Vocational School in Jiujiang was occupied. After negotiating with the Supply Bureau, the bureau ordered the military to move out and restore the school. However, there are many such facts. Examining the root cause, the blame cannot be placed solely on the military. The national defense budget has not yet arrived, and it is impossible to build barracks, so the military's occupation of civilian housing has become a necessary habit, which has greatly affected social order. Moreover, these civilian houses are in poor condition and are not suitable for military use. On the one hand, it is enough to reduce the quality of the military, and on the other hand, it creates opportunities and excuses to bully the people, which is even more harmful. In order to correct this defect, the national defense authorities should start building barracks and warehouses at all military strongholds and transportation hubs across the country in order to completely solve the problem. Adopt the two methods of phased construction and cash requisition of civilian houses to gradually improve the situation and enhance military-civilian relations. It is not possible to turn a blind eye and tolerate it. Yu said finally that he would submit the results of his eyewitness observations as suggestions to the current Political Participation Council and ask the government to pay attention.</p>

<h3>The Jinhua River Water Conservancy Project Can Definitely Start Construction Next Month</h3>

The Zhejiang-Fujian branch has agreed to allocate 600 tons of flour for labor relief, but only two kilograms per worker is far from enough, so it has been decided to request another 1,000 tons of rice to meet the needs. As for the permanent project plan, the outline has now been drafted and will be completed in stages so that farmland water conservancy can be reasonably adjusted and the counties can be electrified. The outline will soon be passed by the Senate and will be the basis for experts to design a concrete plan. The implementation of this plan will have to wait until after March next year.</p>

<h3>Accept the Lessons of History!</h3>
<p>Fifteen years ago today, on the universally known "September 18th Incident," Japanese imperialists bombarded the Beida Camp in Shenyang with artillery, occupying our Northeast provinces without a fight. This was not only the beginning of Japan's war of aggression against China, but also the fuse of World War II. From that day on, we raised the banner of anti-aggression, and after fourteen years of arduous struggle, we finally achieved final victory. Looking back on the experiences of the past fourteen years today, it is as if we have lived through another lifetime, during which we experienced countless setbacks and humiliations, and shed countless amounts of blood, sweat, and tears. Fortunately, our wise leader, Chairman Chiang, led the military and civilians of the whole country in a difficult war of resistance, persevering through countless setbacks and consistently commanding with unwavering resolve, "using constancy to control all changes," and finally overcoming the final difficulties and recovering our lost territories. This not only demonstrates the supreme and unyielding spirit of our nation, but also proves that justice will surely triumph over power, and righteousness will ultimately overcome violence.</p>
<p>Today is the second "September 18th" after our country's victory in the War of Resistance. Our country, both government and people, still commemorate this unforgettable national humiliation day with heavy hearts, not feeling any relief because the aggressors have already surrendered. In the world before us, there are still many problems that have not been solved. Not only is the creation of world peace not easy and international political situations constantly evolving, but there is also the concern that latent aggressive forces have the potential to "not be eradicated by wildfires, but spring back to life with the spring breeze." Even the enemy that we refrained from retaliating against dares to publicly insult the Chinese as the "third kind of people"! We need to be especially vigilant when encountering this anniversary!</p>
<p>First, during the war, far-sighted political and diplomatic figures had already anticipated the difficulty of creating peace after the war. Therefore, even before the end of the war, they advocated that the Allied countries not only needed to cooperate during the war, fighting together on the battlefield to win the final victory, but also needed to unite after the war, working hard diplomatically to create world peace. However, this insightful view seems to have been overshadowed by vulgar and stale hegemonic ideas in the year since the end of the war. The Allied nations that fought shoulder to shoulder on the battlefield now seem to be parting ways again, each going their own way. There is even a feeling of discord regarding the policies adopted towards the former enemy countries. For example, the policies of the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union towards Germany each have subtle differences, and the policies of the United States and the Soviet Union towards Japan are also similar. If this situation is allowed to develop without attempting to remedy it, the result will inevitably only benefit the resurgence of the defeated countries, or they may take the opportunity to reapply their old tricks.</p>
<p>Second, the Allied countries have had considerable success in controlling Germany and Japan. In particular, Japan not only has political democratization, but also its economy and society are relatively stable. In the past year, the traces of a defeated country have gradually disappeared. This is naturally the harvest of our generous policy. However, the Japanese nation has always admired the samurai spirit, believed in the omnipotence of force, and regarded aggression as a virtue. The outdated idea of being "descendants of gods" is deeply ingrained and still erupts everywhere. Therefore, we dare to say that even today, there are still fascist bacteria in Japan. Once the time is ripe, aggressive forces will re-emerge. The current plan is for MacArthur to intensify his work in controlling Japan to eradicate the fascist bacteria in Japan, so that the aggressive warlords will never have a chance to rise again.</p>
<p>Third, human beings are rational animals and should be most receptive to the lessons of history. Critics of the Treaty of Versailles mostly attack France for being too harsh in its treatment of defeated Germany, which led to the people's adherence to the Nazis. Therefore, everyone today advocates that we should never repeat the mistakes of the past and adopt a retaliatory policy towards the defeated countries. During the Paris Peace Conference's discussion of the treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland, the British and American representatives held this spirit. Even our Foreign Minister Wang made a speech in Paris, advocating treating Japan with generosity. However, we must say to the countries that have adopted a generous attitude that while retaliatory policies cannot bind the defeated countries and prevent them from ever turning over, generosity should also have its limits. Otherwise, overcorrection is no different from helping the growth of the previous enemy's aggressive forces, which is harmful and unhelpful to both ourselves and others.</p>
<p>Fourth, at the beginning of the September 18th Incident fifteen years ago, all countries in the world regarded it as a "local incident" that was unrelated to the entire world. At that time, only U.S. Secretary of State Stimson believed that Japan's aggression against China was enough to endanger world peace. He repeatedly suggested to Britain to take joint action to stop Japan's aggressive atrocities. Unfortunately, British Foreign Secretary Simon, with his short-sightedness, not only did not agree, but also made pro-Japanese fallacies at the League of Nations meeting in Geneva, which made Japan's aggressive arrogance even higher, eventually leading to the Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific War. From this, we can see that world peace is indivisible. In the future, no incident in any corner of the world can be regarded as an event in a single place, and it is no longer possible for major countries to isolate themselves. This kind of view has long been abandoned by the times. If all countries truly want to maintain world peace, they must adopt a policy of preventing problems before they arise, always and everywhere prepared to extinguish the sparks of aggression to ensure the collective security of the world.</p>
<p>Fifth, the League of Nations was originally an organization established after World War I to maintain world peace, and it was responsible for sanctioning any country's aggressive atrocities. However, after the "September 18th" Incident, the League of Nations failed to exert its power against Japan's aggression against China, resulting in its reputation plummeting and gradually declining, eventually dying. This valuable lesson is worth pondering by the authorities of the United Nations. Whether the United Nations organization can be the most effective tool for maintaining world peace depends on whether it can quickly resolve any international disputes. However, the permanent members of the Security Council can exercise their "veto power," making it impossible for the United Nations organization to make any judgments on any major issues involving major powers. This defect is enough to constitute its fatal wound and urgently needs to be remedied. Otherwise, the future of the United Nations organization is still uncertain.</p>
<p>In short, the "September 18th" National Humiliation Day gives us a great encouragement, enough to strengthen our belief that after this unprecedented test, the Chinese nation can be confident that it can conquer any difficulties it encounters in the future. Therefore, looking ahead at the domestic situation, although it currently seems to be in a stalemate, it will eventually be able to break through. At the same time, the "September 18th" National Humiliation Day also gives us a serious lesson, requiring us to be extra vigilant, maintain the fruits of victory, and be prepared and vigilant at all times and places to curb the trend of aggressive forces rising again.</p>
<h3>A New Model for Protective Tariffs</h3>
<p>Modern tariffs, except for extremely highly industrialized countries that benefit from free trade or are still bound by unilateral agreements and cannot freely adjust their tax rates, contain a certain degree of protectionist color. In industrially backward countries, this is especially relied upon as the only defense project. It is by no means unjust for any independent country to moderately adjust its tariffs.</p>
<p>Since the victory, foreign goods have flooded in, and many factories have suffered the misfortune of closing or reducing work. Those that have survived are also struggling desperately. Therefore, all parties are loudly calling for and proposing many solutions to save the situation. During the recent general meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council, there were also many such proposals. The government is also aware of this and is not without ideas. Measures such as adjusting foreign exchange rates, abolishing export taxes, providing low-interest loans, and purchasing raw silk have been implemented separately. However, it has always hesitated on the item of raising import taxes, maintaining a very cautious attitude. Although there have been rumors recently about revising import taxes, it is said that the main points are still limited to restricting non-essential goods and prohibiting luxury goods, and there is still no preparation to moderately increase import taxes. The reason for this is nothing more than that the Allied nation of the United States is seeking to flatten tariff barriers, so it does not want to have unique disagreements and disrupt the overall situation. The intention is originally understandable. However, the safety of national industries is related to the life of the country, and protective tariffs are a necessary measure to maintain national industries. There is a distinction between the importance and urgency of these issues, and it is necessary to urgently seek a trade-off to comply with the principle of choosing the greater of two benefits and the lesser of two evils.</p>
<p>As reported by the United Press Washington dispatch in this newspaper yesterday, there is no shortage of precedents for countries adopting this policy. Countries such as India, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Australia have all publicly stated that protective tariffs are indispensable in newly emerging industrial countries. India and other countries are also Allied nations, and their degree of industrialization is above that of our country. Although the United States feels quite troubled, it also gives considerable sympathy and there is no particularly bad reaction. It can be seen that if our country adopts appropriate and reasonable protective tariffs today, it will not cause a lot of difficulties in the international community. Because they are not unaware of the fragility of our country's industry and the oppression of foreign goods currently being suffered. They may even understand it more than we do. Therefore, revising import tariffs and adjusting import tax rates is an urgent matter today, and there seems to be no reason to hesitate. Otherwise, when the oil is dry and the lamp is extinguished, and the people's wealth is exhausted, and there is no longer the purchasing power of foreign goods, it may not be beneficial to the countries that import foreign goods into China.</p>
<p>However, protective tariffs must also meet certain conditions, and careful preparation must be made in advance to achieve the intended purpose. First, the target must be carefully selected. If our country does not have this industry, there is no point in protecting it. The reason why recent people have advocated rewarding the import of goods such as machinery and transportation equipment is this. Second, the tax rate should be raised just to the appropriate level to enable it to compete with foreign goods. If it exceeds this level, it is a revenue principle, not a protective tariff; if it does not reach this level, it loses its protective effect and cannot be considered a protective tariff. Therefore, relying solely on intuition, just trying to save trouble, and vaguely and uniformly raising a certain type of import tax by a few percent is of no help. Third, the industry to be protected must be carefully reviewed in advance. That is to say, is this industry worth protecting? Because of the relationship between the timing or the geography, there is a type of industry that cannot be promoted artificially. There is also a certain industry whose foundation is too weak to be protected, or whose output is too small to meet domestic needs. Then, directly raising tariffs will only indirectly raise prices and increase the burden on the people. For this reason, although we support reasonable protective tariffs, we do not support reckless actions, which would transform them into "fiscal tariffs" in disguise!</p>
<h3>Economic War Prevention Movement</h3>
<p>President Truman recently instructed Representative Winant to propose to the United Nations Economic and Social Council that an international conference be convened in the second half of next year to discuss the preservation and use of world resources to improve the living standards of people around the world. This is indeed good news for world peace.</p>
<p>No one can deny that colonies are the lifeblood of imperialism, and world resources are the blood of imperialists. International wars for hundreds of years have been caused by the struggle for colonies and the struggle for world resources. Generally, politicians with lofty ideals have long called for the equal distribution of world resources. Before World War II, the foremost advocate for economic war prevention was Belgian Prime Minister Van Zeeland, who went to the United States to study this issue. Even British Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare gave a speech in the League of Nations, advocating the redistribution of world resources in an attempt to ease Germany's demands for colonies. However, these arguments were mere empty words before the war and did not materialize.</p>
<p>After this war, everyone held beautiful illusions, believing that the Allied countries that fought shoulder to shoulder during the war would be able to cooperate to the end after the war and would never "be blinded by profit" and take up arms against each other again over the struggle for colonies and the struggle for resources. So this problem seems to have been forgotten. Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, went to Paris in June and July of this year to attend the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. Seeing the constant waves in the international community, he knew that the future of world peace was not optimistic. After returning to the country, he proposed a plan to prevent World War III. The most important point is: "The United States should fully assist the economic and social welfare programs of the United Nations organization so that it can complete the various conditions necessary to maintain world peace." Connally's opinions on international politics have always been valued by the American government and the public, especially since this plan is his masterpiece, President Truman naturally also pays close attention to it. President Truman's initiative to launch the economic war prevention movement this time was probably also influenced by Connally.</p>
<p>There are two points in President Truman's letter to Winant that are most worthy of our attention. He said, "In the coming decades, atomic energy may be used for peaceful purposes"; he also said, "Preserving world resources may become an important foundation for peace." This is the best explanation for economic war prevention.</p>
<p>The war has ended for just one year, and the god of war is vaguely threatening us again! However, the world after the war is deeply traumatized, who would want to see the re-emergence of war? The only way to avoid war is to appeal to human conscience. The economic war prevention movement is indeed worth advocating at present.</p>

<h3>Differences in US-Soviet Diplomatic Policy Cause Domestic Political Crisis Truman Calls on Wallace Today Wallace's Retention Problem Can Be Decided</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 17th Radio: Truman has decided to summon Wallace tomorrow (the 18th). Whether Wallace will remain in his current position will be decided at this meeting.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 16th] President Truman and Democratic Party Chairman Hannegan consulted for a long time today about the internal division within the cabinet on foreign policy after Secretary of Commerce Wallace announced that he would continue to make public speeches against the government's "tough stance on the Soviet Union" plan.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 17th Radio: It is expected that Wallace will return to Washington today to hold secret talks with President Truman. If Wallace continues to publish his speeches against the State Department's foreign policy according to his already announced plan, the government will inevitably experience a great shock. Although Wallace claimed that he had no intention of resigning, a cabinet crisis is not entirely impossible. According to reports from Paris, the US delegation is awaiting the results of the meeting between Truman and Wallace and fully believes that the President will support Byrnes, even demanding Wallace's dismissal, or asking him not to involve foreign policy in future speeches, otherwise he will send his private plane "Sacred Cow" to Paris to carry the US delegation back. Conservative members of the Democratic Party are deeply indignant at Wallace and reminded Truman that Wallace was originally a Republican and only joined the Democratic Party during Roosevelt's New Deal, so he should be punished by expelling him from the party. Mrs. Roosevelt also expressed her opinion that "We believe that a certain secretary of the President must not have carefully read Wallace's speech, otherwise the President would never have disregarded Byrnes' reaction. The foreign policy of the United States must be decided by the Secretary of State and the State Department, but the people have the right to understand this policy and express their own opinions. Fear of the Soviet Union has been created domestically, but I believe that this fear lacks reality."</p>
<h3>Wallace Challenges Frankly Still Insists on Original Position Scheduled to Deliver Another Speech Next Tuesday</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 16th] Secretary of Commerce Wallace today frankly challenged Secretary of State Byrnes again, expressing his adherence to his original position and continuing to attack his so-called "tough stance on the Soviet Union" policy. Wallace, amid the growing cabinet split crisis, spent the weekend holiday returning to Beijing, and immediately talked with President Truman by phone, and immediately issued the following statement: "I insist on the speech I made in New York last Thursday. It is interesting that both the far right and the far left are dissatisfied with my views. I am grateful for the concern of most Americans, and I am willing to continue to work for a fair and lasting peace. I will deliver another speech on this issue in the near future." Wallace is scheduled to deliver a speech in Rhode Island on the 24th of this month. The lecture will be hosted by the National Political Action Committee. Wallace's previous bombing speech at Madison Square in New York was also hosted by the same group. Wallace also intends to engage in speeches throughout the country. Wallace's determination to re-sweep away diplomatic claims not only increases the separation between him and Byrnes, but also expands the rift between his own faction and other members of the Democratic Party. Wallace's speech in New York has been severely criticized by Democratic members in the southern states, with the exception of Senator Pepper of Florida, which is noteworthy</p>
<p>Seeking to Remedy the Damage to Reputation</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 16th] US government leaders understand that they are already planning how to remedy the damage to the reputation of US foreign policy and domestic unity caused by Wallace's speech and the President's change of heart. It is expected that Byrnes will soon officially announce the government's foreign policy, especially the part about the Soviet Union, and President Truman will give the statement a solemn approval. Some Americans have demanded that the President take more decisive action against Wallace, and Republican newspapers have launched a "Wallace Must Go" campaign. People close to Wallace said that Wallace will never resign. Wallace believes that his speech is a middle-of-the-road approach between the anti-Soviet and pro-Soviet extremist factions.</p>
<h3>US and Soviet Troops in Berlin Once Had a Dispute</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 17th Radio: US and Soviet troops in Berlin had a dispute on Saturday, and the situation was very serious at the time.

<p>[United Press Honolulu, 17th] The House Military Committee recently organized an inspection tour to various places in the Far East. According to Republican Congressman Short here today, the United States should strengthen all Pacific bases to cope with the expansion of the Soviet Union. In Tokyo, a US admiral told us that, looking at the current situation, the Japanese will wear US military uniforms in the next war. We might as well say frankly that the war he was talking about is almost certainly a war with the Soviet Union. I think the United States must establish a defense line along the south coast of Kyushu. The Japanese feel that although they have fought a battle account, the United States is still their best friend. The Soviet Union expressed displeasure with this attitude of the Japanese people, and that is why it demanded more say during the occupation period.</p>

<h3>Ukraine Case</h3>
<p>Security Council Discussion Without Result</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 16th dispatch] The United Nations Security Council met successively today to discuss the Ukrainian accusation against Greece. Australian representative Hasluck and Dutch representative Kerstens stated that the Ukrainian representative Manuilsky's accusation against Greece was completely without factual basis. They proposed establishing a subcommittee to determine whether the accusations were reasonable, which would allow the Security Council to reject all libelous or inappropriate demands. Manuilsky immediately followed with a rebuttal. However, British representative Jebb interjected, saying that Manuilsky had not obstructed the Security Council's proceedings, and even Security Council members did not have such a right. Soviet representative Gromyko then proposed a new resolution, demanding that the Security Council compel the Greek government to take steps to stop the activities of Greek aggressors. However, the Security Council did not put Gromyko's proposal to a vote and adjourned immediately, to resume on the 17th.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 16th dispatch] It is expected that after Soviet representative Gromyko takes over as chairman for the second term, the appearance of the Security Council meetings will change significantly, due to the weakness of the outgoing chairman, Polish representative Lange, in handling the recent discussions on the Greek issue.</p>
<h3>Molotov Frankly States: Polish Western Border is Unchangeable; Responds to Byrnes' Policy on Germany</h3>

This is the position adopted by the Soviet government. Some opinions in Byrnes' speech regarding the Polish western border may cause some doubts about the attitude of the United States towards this issue. However, questions of this nature should not be the subject of political calculations. I continue to hope that Polish friends can complete great construction work in their western lands. I am sure that the friendly cooperation between the two democratic countries of Poland and the Soviet Union will be further promoted.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 16th dispatch] Byrnes has not yet responded to Molotov's remarks on the Polish western border issue. Byrnes is expected to make some comments on this matter on Tuesday.</p>

<h3>Confrontation Between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States Could Overturn the Fruits of Peace; Roosevelt's Son Writes a Book Describing His Father's Remarks; Believes Hurley Was a Suitable Person to be Stationed in China</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 16th dispatch] The second excerpt from the book "As He Saw It," written by Elliott Roosevelt, the son of the late President Roosevelt, was published today by "Look" magazine, revealing the inside story of the long wartime debate between Roosevelt and Churchill. Regarding the overall offensive plan of the Allied forces, Churchill originally advocated starting with invasions of Malaya and the Balkans, while Roosevelt strongly supported the plan of US Army Chief of Staff Marshall to land in Normandy, northern France. After a long debate, Marshall's strategy was adopted. In the Pacific, according to Roosevelt, the British also opposed MacArthur's island-hopping strategy and advocated going north along the Chinese coast to obtain a base for attacking the Japanese mainland, not understanding the importance of the Philippine base to the US military. Roosevelt explained this by saying: "Perhaps the British believe that the people of their colonies will not support their operations, and therefore they don't understand that the Filipinos will flock to our flag." Regarding the Balkans, Roosevelt said: "Churchill is deeply afraid of allowing the Soviet Union to become too powerful, which may make it strong in Europe; but whether this is a bad thing depends on many factors. I do not advocate putting the lives of American soldiers in danger to protect the true or imagined British interests in Europe." In Roosevelt's view, the greatest achievement of the Tehran Conference was to explain to Stalin that the United States and Britain were not forming a joint group to oppose the Soviet Union. Roosevelt also said: "One thing that would overturn the post-war apple cart is the most extreme division in the world, with the Soviet Union confronting the United Kingdom and the United States." According to Elliott Roosevelt, his father was sincerely fond of Stalin.</p>
<p>The book also mentions a section about China, saying that the former US Ambassador to China, Hurley, was considered a "suitable person" in Roosevelt's work in China. According to Roosevelt's telling his son: "I can order Hurley to do things that I don't want people in the State Department to do. In the past, people in the State Department have secretly kept official documents and telegrams to me from my knowledge, or deliberately delayed them, or even kept them without sending them." Regarding Stalin and the veto issue, Elliott said that Roosevelt agreed with Stalin at the 1943 Tehran Conference that it was necessary to use individual vetoes to ensure the unity of action of the three powers. Roosevelt also believed that the unity of action of the three powers was necessary for the post-war world.</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia Threatens to Refuse to Sign Peace Treaty Over Trieste Port Sovereignty; Military Committee Passes Resolution Banning Fortifications on Italian Territory</h3>

At the same time, if the port of Trieste becomes an international port and is completely separated from the Yugoslav mainland, Yugoslavia will cut off the port's lifeline. The southern Italian border issue and the Trieste port issue should be regarded as inseparable. The people of Yugoslavia will never yield to unfair rulings, he said.</p>
<p>[This newspaper report] Paris, 17th broadcast: The Peace Conference's Military Committee decided today on the four powers' disposal of Italy's pre-war navy and ordered that the Italian border and Italian-owned islands in the Mediterranean Sea must not be fortified.</p>

<h3>Many Divorces in the United States, French are Busy with Childbirth</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 16th dispatch] According to official statistics, about one in three new families established in the United States last year broke up. More than 502,000 marriages ended in divorce shortly after marriage last year, more than 25 percent higher than the peak in 1944, setting a new record. The number of marriages last year reached 1,618,331, with divorces accounting for 31 percent.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 16th dispatch] The French Ministry of Population has established a plan to encourage childbirth, stipulating that married couples can obtain marriage loans of 80,000 to 100,000 francs, which can be repaid in installments over ten years. For each child born, the debt will be reduced by 20,000 francs. If five children are born, the loan will be considered fully repaid. According to the ministry's announcement today, if France wants to maintain its current population in the next 100 years, each family should have an average of three children. Every poor large family should be given subsidies equal to half of the income of the head of the household to maintain their living standards. France lost 3 million strong young men in the two world wars, and the above measures can make up for the lost population.</p>
<h3>Bevin's Remarks at the London Conference: Federalization of Palestine; United Kingdom Considers Recognizing the Arab League; Protests to Both Jewish Thugs and Arabs</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 16th dispatch] Foreign Secretary Bevin's speech at the London Conference today answered in detail all criticisms of the Palestine federalization plan and guaranteed that all proposed amendments would be given due consideration, allowing Palestine to eventually become fully independent. He said: In view of the interests of Jews and Arabs in the Holy Land, any solution to the Palestine issue must be fair and practical. The meeting was then adjourned for several days. Three members of the Jewish Agency Executive in the UK, Berl Locker, and Washington Gurevitch, flew to Paris today to attend an emergency meeting of the agency to discuss and decide on participating in the London talks. The Jewish Agency Executive met secretly with Colonial Secretary Hall or Foreign Secretary Bevin over the weekend. It is expected that both Arabs and Jews will send representatives to participate when the meeting resumes.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 16th dispatch] The British government is now considering recognizing the Arab League, but may not establish formal diplomatic relations with the organization. It is only to facilitate future negotiations between the UK and its member states through the organization. Since the Arab League is a permanent conference of Arab countries, recognition is more important in administrative terms than in political terms.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 16th dispatch] Huseini, the leader of the Palestinian Arabs, protested to British Commissioner Sir Alan Cunningham, declaring that if terrorist organizations persist in attacking Arabs, the Arab community will take direct action to deal with the terrorist acts. The Arabs also sent four representatives today to visit the commissioner of the Jaffa district, requesting the establishment of Arab self-defense groups to protect the lives and property of the Arab community.</p>
<h3>Japan's New Constitution; Special Correspondent Fu Junyi Reports from Tokyo</h3>
<p>After six weeks of deliberation by the House of Representatives, Japan's new constitution was finally passed unanimously on August 25 and sent to the House of Peers, where it is currently being reviewed article by article. This constitutional amendment is the biggest focus of debate in the 90th extraordinary session of the Japanese parliament. According to the reasons stated by the Japanese Emperor in his imperial rescript at the opening ceremony of the parliament, the Japanese government's motivation for submitting the constitutional amendment to the parliament this time is: "Based on the supreme will of the people, I respect their basic human rights, so that the freedom and welfare of the people can be permanently ensured, and all obstacles to strengthening the trend of democracy can be eliminated, and war can be abandoned to seek permanent peace in the world. Therefore, I am willing to completely revise the constitution that expresses the free will of the people and lay the foundation of the country." In fact, the main reason is, of course, to show Japan's sincerity in fulfilling the Potsdam Declaration. At the same time, this is also the obligation imposed on Japan by the Potsdam Declaration, so MacArthur is particularly concerned about this new constitutional bill. On the second day the bill was submitted to parliament (June 21), regarding the deliberation of the bill, an important statement was issued, saying that (1) sufficient time and opportunity must be given for the deliberation of each article of the constitution; (2) the continued validity of the current constitution promulgated in Meiji 22 should be confirmed in law; (3) the voting on each article of the constitution should be determined by the freely expressed will of the Japanese people. This shows MacArthur's emphasis on the bill, and it also shows that the current constitution is allowed to continue to exist in some places. The newly revised constitution has a total of eleven chapters and 103 articles. In addition to the preamble, the first chapter is the Emperor, with the Emperor as the symbol of national unity. The second chapter is the abandonment of war, excluding all force. The third chapter is the rights and obligations of the people, and the people enjoy all basic human rights. The fourth chapter is the parliament, divided into the House of Councilors and the House of Representatives. The fifth chapter is the cabinet, stipulating that the prime minister is nominated by members of parliament, that is, the system of the majority party in power. The sixth chapter is the judiciary, judicial independence, and all judicial power belongs to the Supreme Court. The seventh chapter is finance, and the power to handle national finance must be based on the decision of the parliament, and the expenses of the imperial family must also be approved by the parliament. The eighth chapter is local autonomy, and the heads of local public organizations must be elected by residents. The ninth chapter is the amendment of the constitution, which must be voted on by the people. The tenth chapter is the supreme law, respecting human rights and international treaties. The eleventh chapter is supplementary provisions. The characteristic of this revision</p>
<p>of the new constitution is to give this new constitution the character of a national constitution (not the people), so the terms national constitution and Japanese nationals are used in the preamble to the constitution. As for the national polity, according to the government's explanation, it will not be changed. It is said that the characteristic of the Japanese national polity is that the Emperor and the people are united as one in the depths of the hearts of the people, and the Emperor is the center of aspiration. Regarding the issue of where sovereignty lies, the provision in the preamble is in the people, not the people, and this people includes the Emperor. The Emperor's position is a symbol of the Japanese state. According to the government's explanation, it is difficult to understand the integration of the Japanese state by observing it with the naked eye. Only when looking up to the Emperor can the situation of the Japanese state emerge before our eyes. Regarding the point of declaring the abandonment of war, Japanese newspapers and foreign reporters have praised it greatly. In fact, the most progressive point of the new constitution is Chapter 3, which confirms all the basic human rights of the people, such as the right to work and the right to collective bargaining. In the House of Representatives,</p>
<p>the focus of the debate was Article 1 of the constitution, which stipulates that the Emperor is the symbol of the Japanese people and the symbol of the integration of the Japanese state. The Emperor's position is based on the supreme will of the Japanese people. In its reply to the parliament this time, the government tried to avoid using the word people as much as possible, while MacArthur clearly stated in his statement that all power should be placed in the hands of the people. In his reply to the House of Representatives, State Minister Kanamori only acknowledged that sovereignty was in the entire body of the people, including</p>
<p>the Emperor. Later, it was considered that the meaning of this sentence was very ambiguous, and it was revised again, saying that sovereignty was in the people, including the Emperor. In other words, the Emperor and the general public are constituent members of the people. The concept of the people refers to the people who constitute the country, and the monarch is also included. The element that constitutes a free country, the people, is the nation. The Liberal Party adopts the theory of national sovereignty, that sovereignty is composed of the Emperor and the people, while the Socialist Party believes that sovereignty is in the cooperative body of the people including the Emperor. Everyone distinguishes clearly between the concepts of national and people, so they are unwilling to use the phrase sovereignty resides in the people, and they support sovereignty resides in the nation, because if it is said that sovereignty resides in the people, the Emperor's position will become very obvious, and he will lose his value. Of course, the people are referring to the monarch, including the monarch. Isn't the people a contradiction? Although the current constitution claims to be a national constitution, not the subjects' constitution of the past, to whom does sovereignty belong in the end? Is it the nation or the people? No wonder Japanese commentator Yasuzo Suzuki said: We in the academic community believe that the new constitution should be completely different from the old constitution in</p>
<p>fundamental principles, but there is a political force that wants to continue the principles of the old constitution in the new constitution. Although this new constitution has some contradictory points in theory, especially the lack of clear provisions regarding the issue of sovereignty, it still stipulates the Emperor's position too high. However, the influence of progressives, such as the arguments of the Socialist Party, played a big role. In the general election in April, both the Liberal and Progressive parties advocated entrusting sovereignty to the ruler and the state, but this time they actually first agreed to the claim that sovereignty lies in the nation, and the Liberal Party proposed to amend Article 84 regarding the provisions of the imperial family property, advocating that all imperial family property should belong to the state. This illustrates the speculative mentality of conservatives catering to the current trend. As for</p>
<p>the attitude of the Communist Party, it completely denies the Emperor system. Nosaka Sanzo said in his speech in parliament: All countries should have the armed forces of self-defense in law. Denying the existence of the minimum armed forces is equivalent to denying the independence of the country and the race. But how will the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration on the disarmament of Japan be fulfilled? How will the Communist Party's slogans of no homeland and opposition to war be self-justified? The current school newspaper constitution is currently being reviewed by the House of Peers, and it is generally believed that there will not be much modification. At most, it will only be a modification of the wording. According to today's Yomiuri Shimbun, it will be passed in the House of Peers plenary session on the 25th of this month. After the House of Peers passes it, the Emperor will officially announce it. The spokesperson of the Washington Far Eastern Commission also said: The new constitution will be recognized soon, so the establishment of the new Japanese constitution is only a matter of time.

<h3>Questioning the Work of the Executive Yuan's Shanghai Branch; Liu Hongsheng Becomes the Target of Public Criticism; City Council Cables the Government to Negotiate the Recovery of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macau; To Listen to the Report of the Enemy Property Administration Today</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] At the 12th meeting of the City Council yesterday morning, Liu Hongsheng, director of the Shanghai Branch of the Executive Yuan, was specially invited to attend to report on the relief situation in the Shanghai area and answer questions. The councilors were very concerned about the work of the Executive Yuan and asked questions very enthusiastically. Director Liu answered part of them verbally, and the rest were answered in detail in writing.</p>
<p>Following the report and inquiry of the Executive Yuan, the meeting began to discuss the civil affairs proposal. The 13th meeting in the afternoon continued, and the discussion was quite exciting, resolving ten proposals. At yesterday's meeting, it was passed that the address of the City Council would be located at the original site of the former Japanese Residents' Association, and it was also passed to cable the government to negotiate the recovery of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and other cases.</p>
<p>The 14th meeting will be held this morning, and the person in charge of the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration will attend to report on the progress of the work. Then, five unfinished civil affairs cases will be discussed, and if time permits, proposals on finance, industry, commerce, and economy will be discussed. The fourth review meeting will be held in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The policy report of the Shanghai Branch of the Executive Yuan and the councilors' questions about the work of the Executive Yuan were the focus of yesterday morning's meeting agenda. Director Liu Hongsheng and Deputy Director Wang Renlin both personally appeared, and most of the responsible persons at all levels of the branch also attended.</p>
<p>Director Liu briefly read out the work report of the branch, and said that he was willing to leave more time for the councilors to ask questions. The content of the report was like a general cash flow statement, and detailed figures were printed and distributed separately. He said: The Shanghai Branch was established in October last year, and as of the end of August this year, the relief work in the past ten months is as follows: (1) Regular relief: distributing materials to Chinese and foreign organizations to relieve the elderly, weak, disabled, and abandoned. (2) Temporary relief: such as setting up porridge distribution stations and shelters. (3) Suburban relief: dispatching work teams to the suburbs to distribute relief in stages. (4) Relief for civilians: setting up refugee transfer stations and reception centers. (5) Relief for unemployed workers: establishing a temporary committee and issuing flour to maintain their livelihood. (6) Carrying out work-for-relief programs such as dredging riverbanks and clearing garbage. (7) Distributing milk powder and flour to schools at all levels. (8) Setting up summer children's recreation stations to accommodate poor children. In addition, the work done in terms of health includes: (1) allocating beds and equipment to assist hospitals in repatriation, (2) establishing clinics, (3) establishing free beds and sending free patients, (4) organizing health inspection teams, (5) establishing dental training courses, (6) establishing milk powder distribution stations, (7) establishing cod liver oil distribution stations, (8) establishing children's milk drinking stations, (9) allocating 400 beds to assist in epidemic prevention. As for the future work, the Nanjing review meeting at the beginning of this month decided to focus on post-disaster recovery.</p>
<p>As soon as the report was finished, the councilors' questions were raised one after another, and Director Liu became the target of public criticism.</p>
<p>The picture above shows Liu Hongsheng, Director of the Shanghai Branch of the Executive Yuan, giving a report.</p>
<p>The picture below shows Deputy Director Wang Renlin answering questions (photographed by this newspaper).</p>
<h3>Regarding the Aftermath, Not the Beforehand: The Poor Only Receive Coffins After Death; They Cannot Obtain Relief in Life: Senators Jointly Question</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhihan asked: When the epidemic raged this summer, the municipal government contacted the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (ERR Administration) for trucks to clear garbage, but the ERR Administration insisted on cash transactions. Only after much negotiation was a portion loaned. May I ask if the ERR Administration has become an organization that "has its own way of making money"? The past is gone, but the garbage problem is still serious. I hope the ERR Administration can allocate more vehicles to help the municipal government.</p>
<p>Mei Hao asked: (1) How much material and funding has the Shanghai branch received? (2) How exactly are these materials and funds being used? (3) How much of the materials have rotted? (4) How much material is left? (5) What are the future improvement plans?</p>
<p>Zhang Xuelian asked: The Shanghai branch has three "many"s: First, there are many cars, and the streets are full of cars from the Relief Administration. Instead of letting branch staff enjoy these cars, why not use them to relieve famine? Second, there are many moldy materials. It is better to not have the materials than to let them rot. This can save on shipping costs and take up less warehouse space. Third, there are many cases of selling relief materials for fees. In the past, if relief efforts were poorly managed, one would "lose one's head." Now, there is no such method. But if this continues, all relief items will probably be listed on the exchange. When the branch was established, were there any plans and steps?</p>
<p>Zhuang Ping asked: Regarding the "hidden poor," especially those in the impoverished education and culture circles, why are some unable to obtain relief even after applying repeatedly?</p>
<p>Hou Junren asked: The damage suffered by the suburbs of this city, such as Jiangwan Dachang, during the Anti-Japanese War was more severe than in the urban areas. Why is the relief they receive now so little?</p>
<p>In addition to Hou Junren's questions, Jia Dechao also asked: (1) The work of the ERR Administration can truly be said to "be good at the aftermath but not the beforehand." For example, the poor on the street receive coffins after death but cannot obtain relief when they are alive. And for example, with epidemic prevention, relief only comes after the epidemic rages. Why not prevent it beforehand? (2) Very few people receive cod liver oil. What exactly is the reason?</p>
<p>Shao Yongsheng separated "relief" and "aftermath" in his remarks. He asked: "If relief materials are sold for fees, what is the meaning of relief? The ERR Administration lacked the spirit of universal love and compassion when planning. It is like writing an essay and forgetting the topic. I hope that future work will not repeat the mistakes of relief efforts, that the organization will not be too large, and that drastic reforms will be implemented."</p>
<p>Lu Keming asked: "In the statistical report, old clothes and shoes are calculated in packages. May I ask how many items are in a package? It is said that many stores in the market sell old suits that come from the Relief Administration. Is this true?</p>
<p>He Chengfu supplemented Lu's questions and specifically cited a store selling old suits at the intersection of Linsen Road and Sinan Road as an example.</p>
<p>Ding Shanming asked the branch to liaise with the Public Works Bureau and other departments to use the method of "work-for-relief" more often to promote suburban construction.</p>
<p>Ma Junshuo asked: "The branch received more than 6,000 packages of old clothes, but only more than 2,000 packages have been distributed. The branch received more than 1,500 packages of old shoes, but only more than 900 packages have been distributed. How will the rest be handled? What are the distribution standards? The number of items in each package should be clearly calculated."</p>
<h3>The Office of the City Council Has a Location: Established at the Former Site of the Japanese Residents' Association</h3>
<p>After the ERR Administration finished reporting and answering questions, there was a ten-minute break before the meeting continued. The Speaker reported that he had inspected the proposed site for the City Council with the Mayor on the afternoon of the 15th. The Shanghai Theater on North Sichuan Road was badly damaged, and the estimated repair cost was 300 million yuan, so it was not suitable. The building of the former Japanese Residents' Association on Peng Road was still intact and large enough. However, it is currently leased by the U.S. Navy Club, and the lease expires in mid-November. It will be contacted with the Enemy Property Administration to not renew the lease at that time and request the government to allocate it as the site of this council.</p>
<p>Finally, the proposal that had been reviewed by the First Subcommittee was discussed. Due to time constraints, only the first proposal in the "Min" (Civil Affairs) category, "Strengthening the Powers of Local Autonomous Organizations in this City to Promote Local Self-Government," was amended and passed before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Liu Hongsheng Calmly Answers Questions About Old Clothes in Taiwan: "I Am Not an Inquirer; Only Heaven Knows."</h3>
<p>The questioning came to a temporary end. Director Liu calmly walked to the podium. He first said: "Everyone is not very satisfied with the Shanghai branch, but the other branches all say that I, Liu Hongsheng, have a way to bring everything to Shanghai." Then he said: (1) The most unfair thing is about the garbage truck. There is garbage in front of my own door. However, the sale of materials is the responsibility of the General Administration, which the branch cannot interfere with. And it is still in use, and ten more vehicles have been lent to other health agencies. As for whether I am helping or not, you can ask Director Zhang of the Health Bureau. (2) The branch has only three Jeeps in total. One is for foreign personnel sent by the General Administration, one is for personnel distributing relief goods, and one is for staff to share. I myself have never sat in one. (3) Some of the so-called moldy materials, such as skim milk powder and flour, have slightly different colors due to different quality components, but they are not actually moldy. (4) It is difficult to say for sure whether the ERR Administration has a complete plan. I say there is a plan, but some things like epidemic prevention cannot be predicted in advance. (5) There is less relief in the suburbs because the relief is based on the number of people. For example, epidemic prevention work is due to the fact that there are more patients in the city center. (6) Whether the old clothes sold in stores are relief items is something that I would have to investigate. Perhaps we gave them to refugees, and the refugees sold them themselves. In addition, merchants can also directly order from the United States and Canada. As far as I know, the price is US$3.50 per pound. (7) The distribution of cod liver oil must be based on a doctor's certificate, because it is not tap water that can be drawn endlessly and distributed to everyone. (8) The number of items in each package of old clothes and shoes is "Heaven Knows." Even the foreigners themselves do not know. (9) The income from the sale of materials is used as funding due to practical difficulties, because although the government has a budget for the Relief Administration, it has not yet been allocated. (10) Relief for the "hidden poor" is not within the scope of relief agreed upon by the General Administration and UNRRA and is not within the jurisdiction of the branch.</p>
<p>Continued Questioning</p>
<p>Zhang Zhihan stood up to refute the Director's statement that "Heaven Knows" regarding the number of items in each package of old clothes. He asked why they could not be opened and counted clearly.</p>
<p>Deputy Director Wang Renlin came to the stage to defuse the situation. He added two points: (1) The meaning of "hidden poor" is difficult to determine. It has now been stipulated to divide them into two categories: ordinary and education/culture. (2) The contents of each package of old clothes range from baby diapers to dancing dresses. There is everything. In the past, schools have been used to set up sorting stations for sorting and altering them. Although schools have now started, efforts will still be made to continue.</p>
<p>It was already 11 o'clock. Although the Speaker had announced the end of oral questioning, many councilors were still speaking from their seats. Wang Weiyan asked what measures the ERR Administration has to improve the fact that the U.S. side is dissatisfied with its work. Fei Shusheng believes that the ERR Administration is too Westernized and that relief should be handled more by domestic agencies. Sun Zhenchun pointed out that the councilors' questions were not malicious and did not regard Director Liu as an "inquirer." In addition, he asked the ERR Administration to pay more attention to relief in the suburbs. Qu Yue also specifically proposed that relief efforts should pay more attention to the suburbs. Zhuang Ping repeatedly insisted that Director Liu give a positive answer regarding relief for the "hidden poor."</p>
<p>Another Reply</p>
<p>Director Liu reiterated that his jurisdiction is limited to the Shanghai branch, so regarding the dissatisfaction of the U.S. side with the work of the ERR Administration, he said that the U.S. side is quite satisfied with the Shanghai branch. As for the Westernized aspect, it is inevitable because the materials basically come from abroad. However, all domestic agencies have been contacted to take on relief work. In addition, he expressed his acceptance of the councilors' suggestions and that he would pay attention to relief work in the suburbs in the future. A series of questions, a series of answers, the atmosphere was quite tense, and Director Liu was obviously a little exhausted. When Chang Zhu Xuefan asked about the overall relief policy of the ERR Administration, his answers were somewhat irrelevant. Finally, Zhan Wenhun stood up and said: "The answers to questions should not be vague and perfunctory. If you want to say something responsible, if you cannot answer verbally, it is better to answer in writing."</p>
<p>At this point, the Speaker decided to end the oral questioning and answer the remaining questions in writing.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Meeting</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the councilors' questioning of the ERR Administration was unprecedentedly intense. Liu Hongsheng was parrying left and right, and he coughed several times from exhaustion. After stepping down from the podium, he took out his handkerchief to wipe his sweat several times. In fact, most of the questions were directed at the entire ERR Administration, and as the director of the Shanghai branch, he can be said to be "taking the blame for others."</p>
<p>Liu Hongsheng's report on the work of the Shanghai branch was concise, but it was too hasty. His answers to the councilors' questions were straightforward, but the "Shanghai style" was too strong.</p>
<p>The councilors' gestures when speaking were quite interesting. Some waved their arms and feet, some shook their heads, some were as still as chickens, and some were restless. Yesterday, a councilor wearing a long gown walked to the microphone, holding the manuscript in one hand and lifting the long gown with the other, which was very comical.</p>
<p>Deputy Director Wang Renlin said that there were many high-heeled shoes among the relief items. They were not suitable for distribution to refugees, and foreigners did not agree to auctioning them off, saying that they hoped that the clothes and shoes they donated could be worn directly by the refugees. He asked the councilors to think of a way to handle them.</p>
<p>After the Speaker announced a ten-minute break yesterday morning, everyone left their seats to refresh themselves. Suddenly, a large mercury lamp in the upper right corner of the second floor was blown down by a strong wind. Fortunately, no one was walking by at this time, and no one was sitting in their seat. Otherwise, there would have been bloodshed in the City Council.</p>
<p>Wu Shaoshu returned to Shanghai from Lushan the night before last and attended the City Council for the first time yesterday. In the morning, he shook hands with acquaintances when he saw them, and those who knew him came over to greet him, which kept him busy.</p>
<p>After Liu Hongsheng finished his report, he said: "If any of you councilors have any questions to ask, I am prepared to be 'interrogated' by you." After hearing the councilors say that the Shanghai branch's relief efforts were inadequate, he quickly said "unjust" and solemnly declared: "I, Liu Hongsheng, was born in Shanghai, grew up in Shanghai, and plan to die in Shanghai, so I will not be sloppy with the relief efforts in Shanghai."</p>
<p>Fu Tongxian made a point, asking the municipal government to pay more attention to the health and welfare of suburban residents. He said: "There is a creek in western Shanghai called 'Stinky Creek.' The word 'stinky' has become a technical term and is famous, which is a real disgrace to Shanghai!"</p>
<h3>The City Council Discussed Proposals on Civil Affairs Yesterday; the Issue of Allocating Temples Aroused Heated Debate</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the City Council continued to discuss proposals related to civil affairs, specifically proposals 2 through 10 in the "Min" (Civil Affairs) category. Among them, proposal 3, regarding "Please the Municipal Government to Allocate Office Buildings to Autonomous Organizations to Facilitate the Promotion of Autonomy," sparked much debate among the councilors regarding the allocation of temples. Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, made some explanations, which were somewhat intense, and included the clever remark that "If the district offices and others do not have houses, I, the Director of Civil Affairs, will quit." Some councilors felt that this was inappropriate. Zhang Xiaosong then voluntarily went on stage to apologize. The councilors applauded, the misunderstanding was dispelled, and everyone was happy.</p>
<p>The review opinion for proposal 3 listed five measures, the second of which, "Allocate Temples and Public Buildings," caused the controversy. Councilor Wang Zhengting stood up and said: "The general public builds temples with their own intentions, and public buildings also have their own purposes. Autonomous organizations should not apply for allocation, taking what others have spent money to build for their own use, which is most inappropriate. Therefore, this item should be canceled." The councilors applauded greatly. Zhu Wende said: "It is okay to change 'allocate' to 'borrow'." Wang Zhengting said again: "Borrowing is excellent, but all buildings can be borrowed, not limited to temples and public buildings, so there is no need to specify it." The councilors applauded even more after he finished speaking. At this time, the Speaker said: "Now we will vote on this point." Wang Jian'e suddenly stood up and explained the difficult situation of district office housing. Zhang Xiaosong gave a more detailed explanation. The mood of the councilors changed, and the motion to abolish this measure was not passed. Finally, the second measure that was passed was "Allocate or Borrow Temples and Public Buildings."</p>
<p>Reducing Redundant Personnel</p>
<p>Proposal 2 was originally "Propose that the Municipal Government Reduce Personnel and Curtail Government Spending to Lighten the Burden on the Municipal Treasury, and at the Same Time Increase Compensation to Enhance Administrative Efficiency." After discussion, the councilors believed that the compensation of civil servants was regulated by the central government and that the municipal government had no authority to independently increase it, so it was changed to "Establish Welfare Programs for Employees in Service." The phrase "to lighten the burden on the municipal treasury" was also deleted. Regarding one of the measures, Feng Youzhen expressed his opinion that "Unimportant redundant personnel should be appropriately reduced" was inappropriate, because how can there be a distinction between important and unimportant redundant personnel? He suggested changing it to "Redundant personnel should be reduced immediately," which was passed.</p>
<p>Delineation of Provincial and Municipal Boundaries</p>
<p>Proposal 4 in the "Min" (Civil Affairs) category was "The Delineation of Provincial and Municipal Boundaries Has Not Been Resolved, Resulting in Conflicting Policies and a Lack of Direction. It Should Be Resolved Quickly to Facilitate Jurisdiction." Two measures were resolved and passed: (1) Request the Municipal Government to consult with the Jiangsu Provincial Government to continue discussions on the boundary issue and make a concrete resolution as soon as possible. (2) In areas that are currently included in this city but still have disputes, police agencies should be established at the same time as autonomous organizations have been established to exercise police power.</p>
<p>Suburban Construction</p>
<p>Proposal 6 was "Request the Municipal Government to Promptly Formulate a Plan for the Construction of the Suburbs of this City to Beautify the City and Benefit Development." The measures were divided into five categories: public utilities, sanitation, education, public security, and others. Fu Tongxian said that suburban construction is more important and more urgent than urban construction. He also suggested that the case be "handed over to the relevant departments of the municipal government for planning and gradual implementation," which was passed.</p>
<p>Replacing Puppet Officials</p>
<p>Proposal 7 was "Request the Municipal Government and Various Bureaus to Promptly Replace Puppet Officials." Because the central government had already made a decision on this point, it was resolved to "hand it over to the municipal government to handle in accordance with the notices issued by the Executive Yuan and Examination Yuan on August 9, 1946."</p>
<p>Regarding proposal 10, "Propose to Commend the Martyrs and Civilians of this City Who Died in the Anti-Japanese War and Provide Compensation to Their Families to Encourage Loyalty," some people had proposed that the case be withdrawn, but most councilors felt that withdrawal was inappropriate, so it was resolved to "request the government to handle it."</p>
<p>As for proposal 5, regarding "Review the Execution of Cases Passed by the Former Provisional City Council," the review method was "submit it to the various specialized committees for handling." After deliberation by the general assembly, it was decided to temporarily retain the case and discuss it together when discussing the proposal of the tenth group on specialized committees. Regarding proposal 8, "Severely Punish Corruption to Comply with the Rule of Law," the general assembly decided to withdraw it, because cleaning up officialdom is a policy rigorously enforced by the government, and civil servants who are corrupt are severely punished, so the City Council does not need to make another resolution. Regarding proposal 9, "Establish Municipal Opinion Boxes in Various Thoroughfares to Adopt Public Opinion and Benefit Municipal Innovation," because the City Council has always accepted people's statements and denunciations, submitting them directly to the City Council is far more convenient than submitting them to the "Municipal Opinion Box," so it was decided to withdraw it.</p>

<h3>Three Councilors Have Started Working on the Investigation Team</h3>
<p>Among the five councilors from Shanghai who were invited by the Shanghai-Hangzhou group of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Area Reception Work Investigation Team, Zhao Junhao, Ma Junshuo, and Wang Jian'e have already reported to the team yesterday. The team leader, Zhang, briefly discussed past work situations with them. It is reported that they will all attend the regular meeting today to discuss and handle various important confidential documents. In addition, the team once sent personnel to thoroughly investigate the case of Navy Captain Chen Yongqin, which was reported, but no evidence was obtained. A second investigation is now underway.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Cripps Will Come to China for a Tour</h3>
<p>Madam Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching Ling, chairman of the China Welfare Fund, announced today that Lady Cripps has accepted her invitation to co-sponsor the children's welfare ball to be held at the Yiyuan Hotel on October 7. Lady Cripps is chairman of the British United Aid to China Fund. She is about to begin an extensive tour of China to examine health stations, schools, and other welfare relief agencies.</p>
<h3>A Carpenter Reported for Collaboration</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yang Ashi, over forty years old, residing in Longhua Township, southern Shanghai, is a carpenter. During the period when the enemy puppets were in power, he willingly collaborated and harmed his compatriots.

<h3>Situ Meitang Will Go to Beijing: Many Emotions After Returning to the Country</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Since the establishment of the Democratic Constitutionalist Party, what the Democratic Constitutionalist Party thinks has attracted much attention. This reporter specially visited Situ Meitang, a standing committee member of the party, yesterday. He said that the purpose of the overseas Hongmen overseas Chinese returning to the country to form a party this time is purely to assist in the revitalization of the motherland. They did not want to take this opportunity to be promoted and become wealthy.</p>
<h3>An Interlude of Allocating Temple Property: Wang Zhengting Deliberates, Cites Evidence, and Battles a Group of Scholars; Zhang Xiaosong Gives an Impassioned Speech and Scolds Monks</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, the weather was gloomy, and the atmosphere in the City Council hall was also gloomy. The thirteenth meeting discussed civil affairs proposals. Councilors argued over the wording of a proposal, one thinking it needed to be amended, another feeling that supplementary opinions were necessary, and another disagreeing. After discussing it back and forth for a long time, just as everyone was feeling bored and tasteless, a scene suddenly occurred, instantly seeming to give everyone a shot of revitalizing energy. …</p>
<p>When the general assembly resolved civil affairs proposal 3, "Propose that the Municipal Government Allocate Office Buildings to Autonomous Organizations to Facilitate the Promotion of Autonomy," several councilors expressed their opinions on the second clause in the measures, "Allocate Temples and Public Buildings." Councilor Wang Zhengting was reporting for duty for the first time yesterday, and he was very dissatisfied with the word "allocate." He said: Temples are built by the common people with their own money. Regardless of whether they are useful or not, they are always people's private property. We cannot arbitrarily allocate houses built with other people's money. If we can allocate privately owned temples, then we can arbitrarily allocate anyone's house.</p>
<p>Later, Gong Xiahe, Chen Baotai, and others proposed changing "allocate" to "borrow." But this old diplomat shook his head again. He said: Borrowing can refer to any house, and private houses can also be borrowed. There is no need to stipulate this in the measures at all.</p>
<p>Perhaps seeing that several councilors could not solve this problem, Zhang Xiaosong, director of the Civil Affairs Department, could not restrain his emotions and asked to speak. He raised his voice and said: "Although temples are private property, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Executive Yuan have already issued orders that temples can be used to run local autonomous undertakings." Suddenly, he thought of the district office being driven out when it borrowed a temple, and he immediately became angry and his hair stood on end. The more he spoke, the more indignant he became: "The monks in Jing'an Temple, Jade Buddha Temple, and others smoke opium, drink alcohol, and gamble. Why can't we use their temples as district offices?" Then he picked up a notebook and slammed it on the table, shouting loudly: "If this matter is not handled well, I will not be the director of civil affairs." Although Director Zhang's impassioned words won enthusiastic applause, they also caused adverse consequences.</p>
<p>Wang Yansong spoke: "I am a good friend of Director Zhang personally, but from the standpoint of a councilor, Director Zhang seems to be a little out of line today. The fact that monks eat, drink, gamble should be reported to the municipal government for handling according to law. There is no need to say this to us in the City Council." Following that, Zhuang Horen also raised a "protest": "The City Council is a body of public opinion. If we want to decide a case, there is a voting method that can be followed. We should not coerce with 'leaving' or 'staying.' Director Zhang's attitude today is very inappropriate, and I think it is necessary to formally apologize to the councilors.</p>
<p>In the quiet two minutes of tense atmosphere, Director Zhang bravely walked onto the podium. With a very sincere attitude, he said: "When we are implementing democratic politics, we must indeed make decisions on everything based on public opinion. Because I have suffered a lot for the district office in the past ten months, I spoke a little more intensely today. I accept your opinions and apologize to everyone." "However, I still hope that you will find a way to solve the problem of the district office." Director Zhang's short words moved everyone very much.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Wang Yansong said to Wang Zhengting: "Today is your first day reporting for duty, and I, on the other hand, caused a disaster with my first speech."</p>
<p>From the conversations of several councilors, we came to a conclusion about the storm yesterday: "Although Director Zhang's attitude yesterday, his words were a bit too much, we can all understand Director Zhang's difficulties and his straightforwardness and sincerity, especially his spirit of being able to bend and stretch, which is worthy of our respect. Therefore, this party, other Hongmen brothers, if they can promote the spirit of Hongmen and serve the country and nation, I am very happy, because different paths lead to the same goal, and our ultimate goal is still the same." Situ also said that in the future, after the leaders of the overseas Chinese who returned to the country to prepare for the formation of a party leave the country, the headquarters of the Democratic Constitutionalist Party will still have overseas representatives stationed to participate and maintain contact. The party has more than three million members at home and abroad, and all funding is self-raised. This 82-year-old leader of the Democratic Constitutionalist Party, after seeing and hearing what he had seen and heard after returning to the country, said with emotion, "The way compatriots at home get along with each other is very different from the love and sincerity of the overseas Chinese abroad." Situ also said that he will soon go to Beijing to meet with the Chairman.</p>

<h3>U.S. Army News Liaison Office in Shanghai: Female Soldier Wu Fengmei, Grew Up in America, Returns to Homeland for the Second Time</h3>
<p>She Says Female Soldiers All Hope to Make a Chinese Friend; Impression of Shanghai Women: Petite, Bright, and Delicate</p>
<p>[Special Report from this Newspaper] The number of female U.S. soldiers stationed in Shanghai once reached two to three hundred at its peak, but most have gradually withdrawn to their home country. The remaining female soldiers will all leave Shanghai by the end of this month at the latest. Most will be transferred to work in Beiping and Nanjing, while others will return to their hometowns.</p>
<p>Sergeant Clerk Wu Fengmei of the U.S. Army News Liaison Office grew up in the United States, but her parents are both Chinese. Under the influence of her parents, she developed a particularly strong love for China. She likes to eat Chinese food, especially Cantonese cuisine, and she loves to wear Chinese clothes, especially the short jackets and long pants that were popular last year. She said, "It's more flexible to wear these kinds of clothes!" She also has a considerable appreciation for the current short cheongsam, believing that this style is more reasonable, so she made one for herself in yellow, because yellow is her favorite color.</p>
<p>Chinese People are Most Nationalistic</p>
<p>Miss Wu was born in Salem, Oregon, a quiet little village with only two Chinese families. Because Chinese people like to gather with their compatriots, they mostly concentrate in lively areas such as San Francisco and New York. Miss Wu said that Chinese people are the most nationalistic, including her mother, who believes that everything Chinese is good!</p>
<p>Miss Wu first came to China in 1924, and has been to Guangdong and Hong Kong. Coming back this time, she feels that many changes have taken place. When asked about her impression of Shanghai, she frowned and said, "Everything is very good, but it's too hot. I have never been to such a hot place in my life!" When the reporter told her that this was an exception even in Shanghai, she replied with a smile, "Then I'm just unlucky." Because there are always many new stimulations when you come to a new place, she said she doesn't miss home. Very few of them suffer from homesickness, and some of them, after arriving in this ancient China, immediately fell in love with it, so some are willing to stay here even after their discharge.</p>
<p>Learned Three Sentences of Chinese</p>
<p>Their dormitories are in the Moller Apartments on Lianer West Road. In addition, there is a swimming pool, library, and tennis court at the Racecourse. Every day after work, they like to stroll on the streets, read novels, or exercise. They all hope to have a Chinese friend, but due to the busyness of their work, there are too few opportunities, and most cannot fulfill their wishes, which everyone considers a great regret. Their impression of Shanghai women is: petite, bright, and delicate.</p>
<p>They all want to learn Chinese, and many have hired teachers to teach Mandarin. At the same time, in just a few months, they have all learned three sentences, and are using them repeatedly, which are—"Not good," "Don't understand," and "I am an American soldier." For example, when they go to a small shop to buy things, when they don't like the goods, they say, "Not good." If the shop assistant explains, they say, "Don't understand," and when they continue to be entangled, they will quickly blurt out the last sentence: "I am an American soldier!"</p>
<p>Curiosity: Mid-Autumn Festival Mooncakes</p>
<p>Their fixed salaries are mostly insufficient to cope with the current high cost of living. Miss Wu said, "This is a common phenomenon after the war. After serious damage, supply and demand cannot be balanced, so the cost of living rises, and limited income is not enough to cover expenses. This is inevitable." Fortunately, they have no burdens, so economics are not the most severe threat to them.</p>
<p>They are very interested in every inherent custom of China. Mid-Autumn Festival mooncakes, incense burners, and firecrackers have all attracted their curiosity. They unanimously said, "To understand China, you can't just look at the surface. Although firecrackers and gongs and drums are boring, if you are willing to observe in depth, every festival and every custom in China has its historical basis and value!"</p>

<h3>Under the Leadership of the "Flying Tiger General," the Air Transport Team Takes Off This Month</h3>
<p>Chennault Hosted News Reporters Yesterday</p>
<p>Upholding the Spirit of Assisting China in the Past; Doing Our Best to Seek Benefits for the People</p>
<p>Headquarters Set Up in Guangzhou; Equipment Costs Paid by UNRRA</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] "Flying Tiger General" Chennault (see photo) hosted reporters at the Leyi Hotel yesterday, and described the establishment of the "Chennault Air Transport Team." He first stated that from 1937 to 1945, he successively commanded the American Volunteer Group and the Fourteenth Air Force in China, assisting China in the War of Resistance. Today, he wants to help rebuild in the very land where he fought. The purpose of eight years of war was threefold: (1) to fight for freedom for the Chinese people; (2) to drive the Japanese army out of China; and (3) to maintain Chinese sovereignty. Fortunately, all three have been successful. However, in order to complete this task, we have also greatly damaged China's transportation. Therefore, today we want to uphold the spirit of assisting China in the past, to relieve the suffering of famine-stricken refugees in disaster areas, to remedy the losses suffered by industry during the war, to improve the lives of the Chinese people, and to help raise the education level of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>The Air Transport Team will be headquartered in Guangzhou. The cost of all equipment and other expenses is approximately US$2 million, paid by UNRRA. Its main task is to transport UNRRA relief supplies to areas designated by UNRRA. Some observers who do not understand the truth have mistakenly believed that Chen's move is an attempt to join the Chinese civil war, and that this Air Transport Team intends to compete with Chinese airlines. Chen solemnly declared that his purpose is to help the Chinese people, not to participate in the civil war. The main area of ​​activity of the Air Transport Team is limited to Central and Southern China. In these areas, he believes there is no civil war going on. As for the competition, it is an exaggeration, because the Air Transport Team is temporary in nature. When UNRRA ends, the Air Transport Team will also be dissolved. Given the current lack of air transport, even if the air transport equipment is five times what it is now, it would still not be enough to meet current needs.</p>
<p>In addition to the equipment worth US$2 million supplied by UNRRA, other miscellaneous expenses required for start-up will require US$1 million, mostly temporarily raised by people who previously participated in the American Volunteer Group and the Fourteenth Air Force. Flying personnel will also be mostly filled by them. The monthly salary of a formal airline pilot is US$800, and if the flying time is more than 80 hours, an additional US$5 per hour will be added. It is expected that flying will begin within three weeks, and it should be on track within three months. Chen estimated that the tonnage of the aircraft may only be enough to transport relief supplies, but if there is space left, it may carry returning passengers. The fare will be in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Communications, but due to the relationship with UNRRA, the freight for relief supplies will be specially discounted. Chen has been preparing to form this team for a long time. When reporters asked him why it was delayed until now, Chen replied that it was because the negotiations with various parties were quite tortuous, but said that if it had been established four months ago, it would have benefited many refugees greatly.</p>
<h3>Legal Adviser to the Ministry of Justice, Pound, Flies to the United States Today; Scheduled to Return to China in June Next Year for Long-Term Work</h3>
<p>World-renowned legal authority and legal adviser to our nation's Ministry of Justice, Professor Pound, is scheduled to fly back to the United States from Shanghai with his wife this morning. They are scheduled to return to China for long-term work in June of next year. During his three months in China, Professor Pound worked very hard, conducting preliminary comprehensive research and criticism of China's legal system. He provided tens of thousands of words of advice, the main points of which are: (1) Since China has adopted the Continental legal system for more than 30 years, it should not make too many changes. (2) China's major legal codes are generally very complete, demonstrating that the drafters had a lot of research back then. (3) In the future, efforts should be made to promote legal education to enrich jurisprudence, and to compile systematic legal masterpieces, so that the interpretation and application of laws can be unified. (4) China's legal system is modeled after the West, and there are some places where it does not conform to national conditions. In the future, it should be adjusted to suit China's needs. (5) Any legal system has its historical and social background. The background of the Western legal system is different from that of China, and it may not be suitable to transplant it to China. National conditions should be considered and selected. (6) China has abundant talents. Chinese people should have self-confidence and not specialize in imitating other countries. (7) Some Chinese scholars have recently advocated abolishing the procuratorate system and replacing it with the British and American national lawyer system, and some have advocated adopting the jury system of Britain, the United States, and other countries. This is due to a lack of understanding of the actual situation of the legal systems of various countries and is not worth learning from. After returning to the United States, Professor Pound will conduct further research on the legal systems of various departments in our country in order to provide advice for our government's reference.</p>

A reporter from Xinhua News Agency yesterday visited Du Baoqi, the chief prosecutor of the High Prosecutor's Office, and was informed that all the death sentences had been appealed to the Supreme Court, but no approval has been received. He believes that the appeals of some major traitors with heinous crimes will be rejected, and the Chief Prosecutor will order the executions. The location of the execution will be the Shanghai Prison where the traitors are detained, and all executions will be carried out by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Anonymous False Accusation Case Against a Colleague: Ouyang Huang Tried by the District Court Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The District Court yesterday tried a false accusation case. Cai Boxiong and Ouyang Huang both operate import and export businesses. Cai opened Yusheng Firm, while Ouyang opened Meifeng Customs Brokerage. Due to competition in business, they became enemies. Ouyang was jealous and took advantage of the fact that the kidnapping case of Rong Desheng, the cotton yarn king, had not yet been solved, and anonymously sent a letter to the police局, accusing Cai Boxiong of being involved in the case and of having received a portion of the stolen money. After receiving the letter, the police局 went to Cai's address and arrested him, taking him back to the bureau. Cai vehemently denied the accusations. The police局 showed him the anonymous letter, and Cai recognized that the handwriting was similar to Ouyang Huang's. The police局 sent personnel disguised as businessmen to Meifeng Customs Brokerage and managed to obtain Ouyang's handwriting. After comparing it with the handwriting on the anonymous letter, they found that they were completely identical. They also found paper identical to that of the anonymous letter in his drawer, proving that Ouyang had made a false accusation. Ouyang Huang was prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office according to the law. The trial was opened in the District Court yesterday. Cai Boxiong hired lawyer Yu Enliang to appear in court. In addition to requesting that the court punish the defendant for the crime he deserved, he also filed a civil suit, requesting that the court order the defendant to publish the full text of the judgment in the newspaper to restore his reputation. The court adjourned the trial.</p>
<h3>American Feng Bank Employee Injured in Car Accident on Way Home</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Zhixiong, a senior employee of the Sichuan Meifeng Bank, finished his work late at night and took a private car to return to his residence at No. 842 Cihui Lane, Qimen Road. When passing Lantian Road on Fuxing Middle Road, a school bus from Shanghai University suddenly stopped in the middle of the road. He braked sharply to avoid it, but unexpectedly, a Qing-Shanghai long-distance bus came speeding up from behind, causing a violent collision and knocking the car and its occupant to the ground. Li was seriously injured internally. A police officer arrived, recorded the license plate number of the vehicle responsible for the accident, and sent Li to Guangci Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a local woman named Wang Juan'di, 19 years old, was returning home from a relative's house. When walking near the Shijiazhai area of Bridge No. 4 on the Shanghai-Min Road, a truck of unknown number suddenly sped from west to east. Wang tried to avoid it but was hit and knocked to the ground, her right foot crushed. She lost consciousness. The driver, seeing no one around, sped away.</p>
<p>At 0:30 yesterday afternoon, a pedestrian named Feng A'wu (resident of No. 14, Lane 309, Wuchang Road) was run over by a jeep with the license plate number 14289 at the intersection of Sichuan North Road and Wuchang Road. He was subsequently sent to a hospital.</p>
<h3>Seeing His Wife's Lover, Husband Planned Murder Using Hammer, Knife, and Any Means Necessary, Senior Clerk Narrowly Escapes Death at Night</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Qin Mingying, a 29-year-old woman from Nanjing, lived in the east back room of No. 1, Hong'an Lane, Guanyi East Lane, Nanshi. She was known to be fierce and unreasonable. After her husband died, she lived with a lover for a while, then divorced. In May of this year, Qin was introduced to Wang Lisheng, a Shanghai native who worked as a senior clerk at the Santai Printing Factory on Maigen Road. They cohabitated in Nanshi. After only four months, Qin grew displeased with Wang's low income, often quarreled with him, and grew to loathe him, plotting to find a new lover.</p>
<p>On the 15th of this month, Wang returned home from work and caught a glimpse of a 30-year-old man in a Western suit lying on his bed. When questioned, Qin tried to cover it up, claiming he was a friend of her late husband. Wang had no evidence and could do nothing. He was already angry about other matters, and so left the house in a fit of rage. Qin did not ask the man to leave. Instead, she prepared a feast for him and invited Lu Suzhen from No. 6 of the lane to join them for dinner. By the time Wang returned home late at night, they had all left. That evening, Qin seemed unhappy and used it as an excuse to demand money from Wang, who handed over all the cash he had, over ten thousand yuan. Afterward, Qin handed Wang a kitchen knife and told him to sharpen it. Wang, wanting to please Qin, took the knife and sharpened it until it was bright and sharp. Nothing happened that night. The next day (the 16th), Wang returned home at 6:00 PM, an hour later than usual. Qin started an argument again. That night, as Wang slept soundly around 10:00 PM, Qin suddenly got up and kicked Wang hard in the waist. Wang woke up in excruciating pain, spitting blood because the kick hit a vital spot. Wang struggled to get up, enduring the pain. Qin threw a glass at his head, causing him to faint and severely injuring his cheek. Qin, afraid he would resist, then struck his spine with a hammer. Wang, in unbearable pain, screamed for help. Qin, hearing his shouts and fearing she would alarm the neighbors, decided to finish the job. She grabbed the incredibly sharp kitchen knife that she had ordered Wang to sharpen the previous night, and wildly attacked him. Wang, slightly regaining consciousness, used his arms to defend himself and was cut. By this time, neighbors had heard the screams and rushed into the east wing, finding Wang covered in injuries, and Qin still attempting to attack him. They restrained her, turned her over to the police, and took her to the Nanshi Yimiao Branch for interrogation. Wang was sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Five Hundred Ambitious Youths Prepare to Organize a Fellowship Association</h3>
<p>Before the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Shanghai Branch of the Youth Corps sent five hundred ambitious youths to study in the interior. They braved the dangers, broke through enemy lines, and safely arrived in the interior in batches. After the victory against Japan, most of them completed their studies and returned to Shanghai. To commemorate the martyred soldiers, encourage their past integrity, and motivate future endeavors, they are preparing to organize a fellowship association for the five hundred ambitious youths. Work has already begun actively. The preparatory office is temporarily located within the Shanghai Branch of the Youth Corps at No. 114, Zhongzheng South Second Road. All five hundred ambitious youths can register with Comrade Yu Zhizhong and Comrade Zhu Zhongyu at the branch.</p>

<h3>Wang Zhengting, Returned from the Philippines, Discusses the Life of Overseas Chinese, from the Municipal Council to the People and Affairs of the Nation</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] In the quiet, I suddenly heard a series of light footsteps on the stairs. Then, Mr. Wang Zhengting walked into the living room. Mr. Wang's hair was almost completely white, which surprised me.</p>
<p>Development of Overseas Chinese Affairs</p>
<p>Mr. Wang said, "When I went to the Philippines, President Roxas had already taken office. Now, the Philippines is generally stable, although there are some minor disturbances in some areas, but they are not very important. The general life of the overseas Chinese is still good, but the new Philippine government has decided on a new restriction for the various enterprises of the overseas Chinese in the Philippines. That is, the salaries of Filipino employees must account for at least six-tenths of the total salaries of the entire company. This may cause considerable inconvenience to the overseas Chinese. Because the restriction on salaries is different from the restriction on the number of employees. The salary of a person with a higher position may exceed the salaries of ten low-level employees, and good talents are still quite lacking among the Filipinos. Because they are restricted by the salary ratio, the overseas Chinese have to hire more Filipinos and raise their positions accordingly. Since there are few talents in the Philippines, the progress of business feels difficult."</p>
<p>I asked, "When the United States recognized the independence of the Philippines, did it still retain some commercial or other preferential rights?"</p>
<p>Mr. Wang said, "Of course, the relationship between the United States and the Philippines has been so close in the past, and the feelings are naturally different from those of other countries. But when the United States recognized the independence of the Philippines, what the United States asked for was only that the Philippines lease some naval and air force bases to the United States for use. As for which locations to lease, it will be decided through negotiations between the two countries."</p>
<p>Sino-Philippine Trade</p>
<p>Next, Mr. Wang talked about the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines. If there are commercial disputes among the overseas Chinese, they are often mediated by the Chamber of Commerce. An American newspaper once criticized this, saying that the Chinese Chamber of Commerce undermined the sovereignty of the Philippines. Mr. Wang said that this was completely a misunderstanding, because the meaning of this kind of mediation is actually only equivalent to "having tea and talking," and the main purpose is to avoid lawsuits due to minor disputes. There is no question of infringing on the sovereignty of the Philippines.</p>
<p>When talking about promoting Sino-Philippine trade, Mr. Wang said that what the Philippines needs most is cloth. The need for tea and silk is very small, but our own cloth is still in short supply.</p>
<p>Concern for Politics</p>
<p>Because Mr. Wang is a city councilor, I asked him for his opinion on the council. He said, "I think it is a good phenomenon that the people are so concerned about politics. But I really think it is unlikely that the efficiency of the municipal government will reach the level of the former Public Works Department in the future."</p>
<p>He lightly brushed the ash from his cigar, and said enthusiastically, "I often say that Chinese people lack three things the most. First, we lack organizational ability. The country with the strongest organizational ability in the world should be Germany, followed by the United Kingdom and the United States. France is far behind, and China is completely out of the question. Just look at how many overlapping government agencies there are? Not only is it slow and procrastinating to do things, but there are also many restrictions. This kind of organizational ability should be cultivated through learning. As long as you are willing to learn, you are not afraid of not learning.</p>
<p>A Kind of Power</p>
<p>"Second, we lack a kind of mutually coordinated power. Chinese people have always managed their businesses independently. Since ancient times, the concept of 'family' has had a very influential role among us. People working in the Shanxi pawnshops were mostly family members, fathers and sons, relatives and old friends. If you want to unite several pawnshops to organize a joint-stock company, it is unlikely to succeed in eight or nine out of ten cases. Take the takeover after this victory as an example. We have suffered from the inability to coordinate, so each agency took over independently. The types of seals were diverse, and the results were very disappointing. In fact, all enemy and puppet property in Shanghai should be entrusted to the Shanghai Municipal Government for takeover, and there should only be one type of seal from the Shanghai Municipal Government. After this unified takeover, it can then be processed, so it will not be chaotic.</p>
<p>"The most important thing is the third point. The cooperation spirit of Chinese people is too poor. In other countries, when someone responsible for doing things succeeds, everyone often thinks that this is part of the success of the entire country, so everyone tries their best to encourage him and help him succeed. It's not the case in China. When a person is about to succeed, others will think, why should success belong to him alone and not to me? As a result, they exert all their efforts to exclude and sabotage, and everyone cannot do things. We must use the power of education to overcome these three shortcomings one by one, otherwise Chinese affairs will never be done well."</p>
<p>Eloquent</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's eloquence reminded me of his posture when he was negotiating internationally for many years.</p>
<p>He said, "My view on national affairs is this: a minority must obey the majority, otherwise there is no talk of democracy. However, this minority should still have the right to criticize this majority. If the opinions of this majority are wrong, after this kind of criticism, the original majority may become a minority, and obey the new majority. This is the true spirit of democracy."</p>
<p>Mr. Wang is a very busy person. He has only recently returned to China from the Philippines, but he may leave Shanghai for another place soon.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education to Convene University Presidents in the Capital to Discuss Examinations for Returning Students; Students from Six Universities, Including Chongqing University, Cannot Be Exempted</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing] Wang Quan, Zhu Songlin, and other representatives of returning students from six universities in the rear, including Yunnan University, Sichuan University, Chongqing University, Guizhou University, Guiyang Normal College, and Medical College, petitioned the Ministry of Education on the 16th regarding their request for assistance in transferring to schools in their hometowns. Details were published in this newspaper. It has been learned that the Ministry of Education has scheduled a meeting with university presidents in the capital this Friday to discuss how to hold examinations and provide assistance to students transferring back to their hometowns. It is said that the Ministry of Education is very concerned about and wants to assist students from the rear in transferring back to their hometowns.

<h3>Regulations for Returning to School for Students of National Middle Schools</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing] The Ministry of Education has formulated regulations for students of national middle schools in the rear to return to school and has ordered various departments and bureaus to implement them. Many students and their parents are not familiar with the content of the regulations, and some who have transferred to other regions do not know whether public funding can be continued. Many have sent letters to the Ministry of Education and various departments and bureaus to inquire. According to an investigation from the Ministry of Education and inquiries to the relevant department and section, supplemented with opinions, the main points of the regulations for students of national middle schools to return to school are extracted below: (1) Students of national middle schools in the rear who return to their original hometowns should report to the Education Department and Bureau of their hometown with a transfer certificate issued by the school in the rear and wait for assignment to schools. (2) If parents are in other provinces and cities, and students do not return to their hometown but want to enroll in the place where their parents are located, they must obtain a certificate from the organization where their parents work and apply to the school for a transfer to another region. After approval, they do not have to return to their hometown and can study with their parents. (3) Those who originally had public funding will continue to receive public funding. (4) Returning students and students transferring to other regions must register for admission or transfer to another region with their academic record cards. (5) The Ministry of Education has distributed the academic record cards to the Education Departments and Bureaus of various provinces and cities, and has also allocated (1) student public funding, (2) teacher salaries, (3) class fees (if there are 25 students, the funding for one class will be allocated; if there are only 20 students, half of the class funding will be allocated), (4) construction fees to the Education Departments and Bureaus of various provinces and cities from August onward for the use of these departments and bureaus to handle the restoration of these students. (6) The Ministry of Education established national middle schools to provide relief to displaced youth during the war. Now that victory has been achieved and they are returning to their hometowns, the students of national middle schools will be transferred to local management, and considerable funding will be provided at the same time. From now on, the Ministry will not directly run middle schools, nor will it distribute students anymore.</p>

<p>Civil Affairs Briefs</p>
<h3>National Identity Cards Should Be Applied for According to Law; Civil Affairs Bureau Dispatches Letters to Each District for Implementation</h3>
<p>In order to understand the situation of citizens obtaining national identity cards, the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government has specifically stipulated that during this household re-registration, residents should be checked to see if they have applied for identity cards. If residents should apply for identity cards according to Article 2 of the revised Interim Measures for Issuing National Identity Cards by the Municipal Government but have not yet applied, they should be notified immediately to apply for them according to law. Yesterday, letters were sent to each district office, instructing them to earnestly comply and report the results of the inspection.</p>
<h3>Matters Needing Attention When Filling Out the Household Re-Registration Form Before Registration (Continued)</h3>
<p>4.  Age and Date of Birth: The age filled in the household register is the "actual age" of the person at the time of filling out the form. The calculation of "actual age" should be based on the "date of birth." (In the past, calculations were based on ordinary age, which easily led to errors, so in the future, calculations must be based on the date of birth). Therefore, when filling out the form, the date of birth can be filled in first, followed by the age. However, it is not easy for most people to answer what year they were born. A table is attached to find the year of birth from "ordinary age" or "zodiac sign."</p>
<p>Age Conversion Table (For the 35th Year of the Republic)</p>
<p>For example, if the ordinary age is 35 years old, then the year of birth is the 1st year of the Republic. If the ordinary age is 67 years old, then the year of birth is the 32nd year before the Republic. Or, if a person's zodiac sign is Ox and is in their forties or fifties, then the table shows that those with the zodiac sign of Ox in their forties have an ordinary age of 46 years old, meaning they were born in the 11th year before the Republic.</p>
<p>If only the lunar month and day of birth are remembered, they should be filled in with the lunar calendar. If the month and day of birth are completely forgotten, then they should be estimated as July 1. If the month of birth is known, but the day of birth is not, then it should be estimated as the 15th of that month.</p>
<p>After filling in the date of birth, the actual age can be calculated based on the date of birth. Another table is attached to convert the "date of birth" into actual age.</p>
<p>Table for Converting Date of Birth into Actual Age</p>
<h3>Three Bao Chiefs in the 30th District Resign</h3>
<p>Ji Zong, the Bao chief of the third Bao in the 30th district, has submitted his resignation. The district office has forwarded the resignation to the municipal government for review. Before approval is received, all Bao affairs will be temporarily handled by the deputy Bao chief, Zhang Longxiang. In addition, the resignation of Zhang Gencai, the Bao clerk, has been approved, and Yu Xianxuan has been appointed to fill the vacancy. This has been reported to the Civil Affairs Bureau for record.</p>

<h3>Regarding the Matter of Paying Deposits a Thousandfold: Opinion of the President of the Judicial Yuan; Matter is of Great Importance and Is Being Closely Discussed with the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, this reporter visited Ju Zheng, the President of the Judicial Yuan, to inquire about his opinion on the court ruling that pre-war bank deposits should be repaid a thousandfold. President Ju replied that, in terms of price index, a thousandfold is not excessive. This is because the price of rice and cloth has increased by more than five thousand or even ten thousand times compared to pre-war levels. However, 20 percent of the commercial bank's reserves are deposited in the national treasury and cannot be used. This point of loss should also be taken into account. Currently, the Shanghai Four Banks Savings Association has filed an appeal against the ruling. It would not be right for the court to reject it. This matter is of great importance and involves many problems. If it is not resolved, then the settlement of pre-war debts and the withdrawal of long-term savings upon maturity will inevitably lead to many disputes. I previously discussed this matter with Minister Yu of the Ministry of Finance, and we are currently discussing solutions.</p>
<h3>Dividing the Nation into Nine Economic Zones</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] The central design organization is following the instructions of the authorities to design the division of the country into nine economic units. This work began before the end of the Anti-Japanese War. The general outline of the nine economic regions, it is said, was determined by the highest authority and developed with the input of Weng Wenhao. In the future, the construction of each region will have its own central objectives based on the distribution of its natural resources. Furthermore, because this design work has national defense confidentiality, it will not be made public after completion.</p>
<h3>Gold Notes Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the exchange rate remained calm. The morning opened at 2,147,000 with sellers offering. After the opening, the rate was immediately surrounded by sellers at 2,148,000, gradually declining slightly. However, there was much struggle around 2,140,000. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank distributed 50 bars at a price of 2,135,000. After that, it briefly decreased to 2,132,000 and then stabilized slightly. At noon, it was around 2,135,000. In the afternoon, it first retreated to 2,130,000. Next-day settlement still rose to around 2,140,000. As a result, there was no change compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments, silver ingots, and silver dollars were all flat. The secret interest rate retreated to around 1.3 jiao due to the easing of money supply.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies continued to be mediocre. However, the Hong Kong dollar increased slightly. The US dollar opened in the morning at 3380 yuan with sellers offering. There were no changes along the way. Later, due to the slight decline in the gold market, it retreated to 3160 yuan at noon and then stabilized slightly. In the afternoon, it rose slightly. As a result, it rose by 5 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong banknotes were stable after the initial flat opening and also rose by 3 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was stable after the initial flat opening. The Hong Kong telegraphic transfer narrowed slightly and rose to 695 yuan to 705 yuan. The Indian exchange rate also improved and was offered at 845 yuan. The British exchange rate rose slightly to 11,400 yuan with supplies available. The US exchange rate remained at the posted price.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Declined Slightly</h3>
<p>Trading in government bonds was still brisk, reaching more than 7 million yuan in par value. Most buyers were still retail investors. Occasionally, there were institutional buyers, which was relatively stable. The A-B-C bond opened in the morning at 2100 yuan. After the opening, it fell to 2050 yuan, and then buyers became active. The market improved to 2180 yuan midway before turning back. Before closing, it retreated to below 2100 yuan again. As a result, it declined slightly by 50 yuan compared to the previous close. Bonds A, B, and E were flat, and Bond D fell sharply by 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Continue to Decline, Situation Forms a One-Sided Fall</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks continue to be sold off, and new buyers are nowhere to be seen. The situation is trending downward in a one-sided manner. Except for paper stocks Xiangtai, which are still stable, the others are difficult to rally. As a result, compared to the previous close, Jardine Matheson Textiles and British-American Tobacco fell by half a percent, steel stocks fell by 10 percent, and Wing On, Asia, and Wheelock Marden fell slightly, although they fell. Paper stocks were flat.</p>
<h3>Standardizing the Purchase Price of Autumn Cocoons: Not Lower Than 200,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The purchase price of autumn cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has been repeatedly discussed by the China Silk Corporation, the authorities of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and the silk industry associations of the three regions. In order to encourage silk farmers to produce and increase the purchase price of fresh cocoons, it was decided to use the price of three dan of rice to convert into the price of one dan of fresh cocoons. However, because the price of rice varies from place to place, in order to unify the purchase price, consultations were held several times. Finally, it was decided to unify the purchase price, which was submitted to the authorities for approval. It is now learned that the unified price has been approved by the authorities, and the price of each dan of fresh cocoons should not be lower than 120,000 yuan. Now that the cocoon markets in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are about to open, the purchase price must comply with the approved unified price and should not be lowered to ease the burden on silk farmers.</p>
<h3>Rayon Surpasses 3 Million Yuan: General Silk Manufacturers Are Panic-Stricken</h3>
<p>The momentum of rayon has been surging for days, and the black market is in high spirits. There is an endless stream of buyers. Yesterday, it surged past the 3 million yuan mark again. No. 120 Tianqiao Youguang opened in the morning at 3,050,000 yuan, which was 890,000 yuan higher than the previous day. In the morning, the lowest was 20,000 yuan, and the highest was 80,000 yuan. Later, it closed at 3,060,000 yuan. In the afternoon, holders blindly raised prices, and transactions were made at 60,000 and 80,000 yuan. In the end, someone wanted 100,000 yuan, and the seller shouted 200,000 yuan, which was 145,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Miscellaneous brands of No. 120 Youguang were 111,200 yuan higher. Semi-gloss was traded at 2.7 million yuan in the morning, and the afternoon saw prices of 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. Factory managers have been affected by rayon, and transactions with user silk have been quite frequent. The market is strong and resilient, but no one is interested in high uniformity, making it difficult to see a good market price. Silk goods have generally increased by about 10 percent, but transactions have not yet begun. In general, silk manufacturers are in a state of anxiety all day, not knowing what to do. Because the price of raw materials is soaring, the price of silk goods is really hard to catch up with.</p>
<h3>Sugar Stocks Are Quite Abundant</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The city's sugar is in a state of panic. It is not easy for various South Goods businesses to allocate supplies. However, according to shipping news, the city's sugar stocks are extremely abundant. The second wharf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, i.e., Zhongzhan, and the fifth wharf, i.e., Pudong Yangjiadu, have no less than 300,000 bags of sugar in stock, which have been piled up for several months without being withdrawn. As a result, yesterday, the Haiyu vessel came to Shanghai from Keelung and loaded a large batch of Taiwan sugar, but there was no way to store it.</p>
<h3>Limited Outlets for Timber</h3>
<p>The timber market has not improved since the Mid-Autumn Festival. Because of the continued arrival of foreign pine, outlets are limited, and the market price is hovering around the cost line. Due to the surge in the arrival of fir, sellers are reluctantly suffering losses. Therefore, the future of the general timber market is difficult to be optimistic about.</p>
<h3>Artificial Cotton Invented by a Chinese</h3>
<p>Can Start Work Around Double Ten Day</p>
<p>It is reported that the long-awaited artificial cotton will be launched soon. This reporter met with Hu Yi, the inventor of artificial cotton who came to Shanghai from Hangzhou yesterday. According to him, he is now cooperating with Shen Yiguo in the industrial sector to plan the establishment of Chinese artificial cotton manufacturing plants in Shanghai and Hangzhou. The problems of factory location, etc., have been solved, and it can be officially put into operation around Double Ten Day.</p>
<h3>Banks Freeze Foreign Exchange; Central Bank to Purchase Starting Next Month</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources, the Central Bank has taken further measures to manage foreign exchange. In addition to the US dollar, all foreign exchange positions frozen by banks that have not been paid by the end of this month will be purchased by the Central Bank at the market price at that time. After that, foreign banks will not be able to open foreign currency accounts in order to prevent the private settlement of foreign exchange with US dollars.</p>
<h3>US Pacific Route Avoids China and Japan; Shifts to Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 16th] According to reports heard from the Maritime Commission, the interest of the US Pacific routes seems to be shifting from Japan and China to Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. This tendency is due to the desire to expand shipping in the South Pacific and the uncertainty about trade with Japan and China. Currently, there are ten US shipping companies that want to establish new routes or restore old routes in that area, compared to only three before the war.</p>
<h3>New Xianzhong Second Continues to Fall; Coarse Grains Show No Improvement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market continued to be connected to sources, registering more than 7,000 stones. New Xianzhong Second remained downstream, showing a fatigue of more than 1,000 yuan. High-quality goods were still fixed. New japonica and old japonica presented a fixed situation. West Road early-color japonica is entering the market, while medium-color and late-color still need time. Baiyuan and Xin Yinyuan are bitterly without inquiries, continuing to fall sharply, down another 3,500 yuan. Flour still tends to be strong. Wheat from Fujian and Ningbo slightly improved, rising 5-600 yuan. Soybeans from Shantou were cleared. The market here was not strong, still more supply than demand, with prices falling 5-600 to 1,000 yuan. Medium and low grades still lacked transactions. Broad beans were in a stagnant situation. High-quality raw peanuts were fixed, and medium grades continued to decline by 1-2,000 yuan. The red sorghum market softened. Corn was still. Cowpeas fell by 1,000 yuan following the trend. The oil market showed hopeful signs. Goods from Qingdao and Dalian arrived slightly. Factory supplies were still connected. Various oils fell by 2-3,000 yuan. Soybean cake had few transactions in various ports and rural areas, falling another 3-400 yuan.</p>
<h3>Is Increased Payment of Pre-War Deposits Appropriate? (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Xie Tingxin</p>
<p>The matter of repaying pre-war deposits with increased multiples has attracted close attention from the economic and social sectors due to the Shanghai Branch of the Four Banks Savings Association case, in which the Shanghai Local Court ordered a payment of 1,000 times. Disputes over private debts and claims will also emerge endlessly as a result. The basis for the court's ruling this time is Article 12 of the "Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After Reconstruction," promulgated on December 18, 1945, and the Judicial Yuan's Interpretation No. 3018, which states that the provisions for increasing or decreasing payments are universally applicable. Since there is no express exception regarding payments by banks, they should naturally be applied. These are all rulings that favor depositors, and it seems that sufficient consideration has not been given to whether the rulings are fair to banks. Therefore, I will state my views in two aspects.</p>
<p>In terms of legal principles:</p>
<p>1.  Conflicts with the Savings Bank Law: The only reason for the ruling in the judgment that the bank should pay 1,000 times is that "after receiving savings deposits, the defendant actually used part of the deposits as working capital, and the remaining deposits were used to purchase government bonds and other bonds as collateral, or invested in real estate to stabilize the assets. They must have used the funds received for multifaceted activities and utilization. Even though government bonds suffered considerable losses due to the Ministry of Finance's method of repaying the principal at par value, the value of currency in other investments has greatly increased. They should naturally be required to increase the payment a thousandfold to maintain fairness." The defendant is the Four Banks Savings Association. The Savings Association's use of funds must be carried out in accordance with the "Savings Bank Law" passed by the Legislative Yuan on June 22, 1934, and promulgated by the National Government on July 4 of the same year. Article 7 of the Savings Bank Law has the following provisions regarding the use of funds by savings banks:</p>
<p>Savings banks may not use their funds except in accordance with the following methods:</p>
<p>(1) Purchase of government bonds, treasury bills, and other valuable securities recognized by the Ministry of Finance with reliable collateral.</p>
<p>(2) Loans secured by government bonds, treasury bills, and other valuable securities recognized by the Ministry of Finance with reliable collateral.</p>
<p>(3) Loans secured by real estate with continuous and reliable income as collateral.</p>
<p>(4) Loans secured by time deposit certificates or passbooks of other banks as collateral.</p>
<p>(5) Purchase of bills accepted by other banks.</p>
<p>(6) Deposits in other banks.</p>
<p>(7) Collateral loans to rural cooperatives.</p>
<p>(8) Loans secured by agricultural products as collateral.</p>
<p>It can be seen that most of the methods used by savings banks to use funds are lending and purchasing government bonds, and they can never invest in real estate. Otherwise, it would be illegal. The phrase "or invest in real estate" mentioned in the judgment is a conjecture and has no basis. Savings banks have minimum requirements for loans under items 7 and 8, and there are quality and quantity restrictions for valuable securities other than government bonds. Therefore, it can be said that the vast majority of savings banks' funds are used for lending and government bonds. Both of these investments depreciate with the devaluation of the currency, making it difficult to achieve the ideal of "greatly increasing the value of currency" mentioned in the judgment. In fact, banks may not have fully operated in accordance with the Savings Bank Law, but since the law has been implemented, the judiciary cannot deny it. Furthermore, it cannot arbitrarily list "investment in real estate" as one of the ways for savings banks to use funds. The judicial authorities did not send personnel to audit accounts and made arbitrary judgments without legal basis. This is one of the things overlooked in the judgment. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Fall Across the Board; Selling Pressure in the Market Is High</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday was the second day of stock auctions at the Securities Exchange. As a result of the trading, the stocks continued the previous day's trend, all falling. However, there was progress in the collective reconciliation of accounts at 5:00 PM, and the accounts were balanced by 6:22 PM. Yesterday, the Securities Exchange also issued two public notices in the stock market. Notice No. 17 stated that the trading unit for Meiya Silk Factory's stock has been changed to 500 shares starting on September 10. The 100-share stock can still be delivered as usual. The general situation of yesterday's trading is described as follows:</p>
<p>When the stock market opened yesterday, the market price of the Gu stocks was almost the same as the closing market price of yesterday. The brokers in the market were very enthusiastic in bidding after the opening. The market in the market was quite stable within half an hour. After 10:30, the atmosphere in the market turned active, and the trading was extremely strong. The market prices of Yong'an Yarn Factory, Qinxing Socks and Shirts, Xinguang Underwear, and Meiya Silk Weaving all tended to flourish. Yong'an Yarn Factory once rose to 658 yuan, Meiya rose to 4,220 yuan, and Qinxing rose to 239 yuan. Then they showed a slight fatigue again. After 11:00, the market situation became quieter, and the trading decreased, and the market price went downstream. After 11:30. The decline was greater, Yong'an Yarn Factory fell to 628 yuan, Dongxing Socks and Shirts fell to 224 yuan, and the decline of Meiya was even more severe, with some transactions at 4,030 yuan. The market price only recovered slightly when the market closed at 12:00 noon. Looking at the market situation today, it is similar to yesterday, and the market prices of all stocks have fallen slightly, but the decline is not large. The difference between the highest and lowest prices is only about 5% on average. The total transaction volume was 4,920,900 shares, of which Yong'an Yarn Factory had a transaction volume of more than 1.5 million shares, Dongxing had a transaction volume of 540,000 shares, Huafeng had a transaction volume of 470,000 shares, Liangfu had a transaction volume of 465,000 shares, and Meiya had a transaction volume of 180,000 shares, all of which were more than the transaction volume yesterday.</p>
<p>Also, Huagu continued to fall sharply in the securities industry. Some medium-sized stocks in the cold stocks suddenly lacked maintenance and began to fall miserably. On the contrary, small stocks such as Lian'an Department Store and Huafeng Enamelware were still active and remained unmoved. When the stocks fell to below the previous closing price, the short sellers made up their positions at one time, and those who made profits also took advantage of the opportunity. The Guang Gang slightly improved, but suddenly there was a counter-trend in the middle, and the hot stocks once rose above the opening price before the buying stopped. Then the trend of selling became popular again, and the Bei Gang also sold. Yongsha first fell back, affecting other stocks. The most fatigued among them were Dachina Match, Wing On Company, and the decline was the largest. Rongfeng, Huafeng, and Lian'an were very stable, and they showed upward gestures from time to time. Before closing, the overall situation was unfavorable, and the high prices also came back. As a result, the previous closings of Yongsha, Meiya, Jingfu, Xinguang, Qinxing, and Zhongfang each fell by less than half a percent. Tongyi, Wuhe, and Cement Datong had a slight decline. The silk industry Xinhuo Underwear fell by more than half a percent, and the company Xinya fell by 10%. Match fell by 15%, which was the largest decline. Jinglun Rongfeng was flat. Lian'an Huafeng continued to rise. The various stocks outside the market also showed small gains.</p>
<h3>After the Fujian-Guangdong Ban on Transport, the Yarn Market Is Still Firm; Textile and Construction Warehouse Receipts Are Welcomed on Time; 37 Kinds of Cotton Cloth Prices Are Unchanged</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the yarn market was as stable as a rock. Although there were no sales in South China, the Bei Gang had a good appetite. Medium-sized yarns such as Hong Kuixing and Tiannv were sold a lot. Customers along the Yangtze River also absorbed shares, so the yarn market was very firm, and it did not weaken slightly due to the ban on transport in Fujian and Guangdong. The trading of textile and construction futures warehouse receipts was very lively among peers, because the warehouse receipts of the company arrived on the date of delivery without any mistake, which is unlike the distribution warehouse receipts of private factories, which have arbitrary delays.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that yesterday morning, the Bei Gang absorbed 20 counts of yarn and loaded them to Guanwai. According to Bei Gang merchants, loading to Guanwai at today's closing price has a considerable surplus. Therefore, the people's minds were excited for a while, but in the end, because the appetite was not strong enough, it tended downstream again. At the close near noon, the price was slightly lower than the previous day, with 42 counts of Blue Phoenix at 2.16 million to 2.2 million yuan, and 20 counts of Blue Phoenix at around 1.4 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Fangjian opened a total of 37 kinds of white print drills and blue V-shaped fine cloth. The prices were still according to the original board. Many numbers applied for drills, but few were approved. After the purchase orders were issued at 4:30 PM, it was learned that the market price of old drills was still shouting 66,000 yuan, but no one was willing to sell. Blue V-shaped was shouting 62,500 yuan, and colorless ball was shouting 58,800 yuan. Dyeing factories needed the leading high-end gray cloth, but Fangjian did not open it yesterday, resulting in no market.</p>
<h3>Behavior Tax Mixed into Commodity Tax: Dried Meat Also Taxed with Slaughter Tax; Only Increase Revenue, Disregarding Legal Principles</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The City Chamber of Commerce, based on a letter from the city's Ham and Cured Meat Trade Associations, requested the abolition of the dried meat slaughter tax. A special submission was made to the Nanjing Ministry of Finance and the Shanghai Municipal Government. The original letter stated: "The slaughter tax is levied at a statutory rate on the act of slaughtering and selling. According to the Business Tax Law of the 20th year of the Republic of China, it was originally classified as a type of business tax. Although the slaughter tax was separated from the business tax in the two revisions of the Business Tax Law in the 32nd and 35th years, the slaughter tax is levied because of the act of slaughtering and selling. Therefore, it is undeniable that this tax is a behavior tax. A behavior tax is a tax on people, a type of direct tax, which is absolutely different in nature from a tax on goods, which is an indirect tax that can be passed on at any time and place. Article 4, Paragraph 1 of the Shanghai Slaughter Tax Collection Rules stipulates that 'Fresh and dried meat transported in from outside the urban area, unless they hold a certificate from the original slaughter site's collection agency proving that the slaughter tax has been paid, shall be exempted from taxation after verification.' This provision arbitrarily changes the behavior tax into a commodity tax, treating it the same as a commodity tax that requires tax payment certificates for verification and release. This fundamentally violates the principles of tax law and is a fundamental error. In recent years, local governments have promulgated regulations for collecting taxes, aiming only to expand the scope and increase revenue, often failing to consider the basic principles of tax law. As a result, taxpayers are at a loss, and their appeals often go unanswered for years. The matter is truly lamentable. In light of the above, we earnestly submit this telegram, hoping that your Ministry (Government) will review and approve it. Considering the name of the dried meat slaughter tax, based on the principle that the slaughter tax is a behavior tax, there is no room for it to exist. We request immediate verification and abolition, as it is in the public interest."</p>
<h3>Qingdao Cotton Yarn Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiwan vessel arrived in port yesterday from Qingdao, carrying over 71,000 pieces of goods such as fruits, including over 500 pieces of cotton yarn and over 800 pieces of tobacco leaves. The shipment of Qingdao cotton yarn to Shanghai is a first.</p>
<h3>British Trade Delegation to Fly to Shanghai from India on the 23rd</h3>
<p>The British trade delegation is visiting various places in the Far East for inspection. They are currently inspecting the cotton textile industry in places such as Calcutta and Mumbai. They are scheduled to fly to Shanghai from India on the 23rd of this month. Zhang Ziyue, the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Shanghai, has joined relevant agencies and commercial organizations to prepare for a welcome.</p>
<h3>Fake Central Reserve Bank Deposits: Periodic Continued Return</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance's Liquidation of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank has been returning deposits from the enemy-puppet period in accordance with regulations. To date, some depositors have not yet claimed their funds. In consideration of the people's rights and interests, the office has drafted further refund measures for approval by the head office. It is scheduled to resume refunds starting on October 1st, for a period of two months. The scope of liquidation responsibility of the office includes the Shanghai Branch of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank, the Suzhou Sub-branch, and eight offices in Huxi, Hunan, Nantong, Songjiang, Taicang, Kunshan, and Wuxi. In addition to public announcements in the city, the office will also forward announcements to the county governments to inform depositors in other counties. If depositors do not claim their funds by the deadline, the office will compile the cases and hand them over to the national treasury.</p>
<h3>New Quanzhou Pao Yuan (Longan) Opens</h3>
<p>The first batch of new Quanzhou Pao Yuan (longan) opened in the market yesterday. The higher prices were 280,000 yuan, with slightly lower prices for the next best. It is about 10% smaller than the first batch of Tong'an goods. As sales are not yet brisk, the market is average.</p>
<h3>High Cost of New Tea Makes Export Difficult; Stagnant Sales of Aged Tea Also Obstructed; Japan Ships Large Quantities of New Tea to America for Competitive Sales</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Our country's uncolored green tea has been sold to the United States in large quantities over the years. According to General Manager Li of Wuchang Tea Company, who spoke to reporters, the demand for tea is quite strong at present, but the price of our country's new tea is too high to promote sales. Although aged goods are closer in price, a large batch of Japanese new green tea has recently been competing for sales, reaching as much as five million pounds. It is said to be divided into three batches. The first batch of 1.5 million pounds has already been shipped, the second batch of 1.5 million pounds is also about to be shipped, and the third batch of 2 million pounds is scheduled to be shipped in early October. Based on the current situation, the promotion of our country's aged tea to the United States will once again be in a difficult situation.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 16th] The second batch of Japanese tea, totaling 1,500,000 pounds, is expected to arrive here in early October. The first batch of the same quantity was recently imported by an American trading company dealing in Japanese silk. The total amount of Japanese tea shipped to the United States in the next four months is expected to reach 5,000,000 pounds.</p>

<h3>The 15th Anniversary of the September 18th Incident: Old Scars Reopened, New Sighs Never Cease</h3>
<p>— From Our Newspaper Archives</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago today, the brutal Japanese army invaded our Northeast, causing the world-shocking September 18th Incident, leaving a permanent stain on human history. Fifteen years later today, more than a year after Japan's defeat, the Northeast is still full of scars. Looking back on the past and contemplating the present, there are countless sighs and infinite pain!</p>
<p>Speaking of the Japanese invasion of China, it was originally planned in the "Continental Policy." The famous "Tanaka Memorial" had already spread the fallacy that "to conquer the world, one must first conquer China; to conquer China, one must first conquer Manchuria and Mongolia." In addition, the world economy experienced a panic in 1929, and Japan's foreign trade decreased sharply. In 1931, the number of unemployed people in Japan suddenly increased, and workers and farmers were restless. In order to alleviate the domestic revolutionary crisis and divert people's attention, the rulers and the bourgeoisie had to seek a way out abroad, and the Northeast bore the brunt. In addition, the international situation at that time was complex, with Western countries mostly preoccupied with their own affairs, and China was newly unified and not yet fully stable. The enemy believed that a good opportunity was rare, so they blatantly disregarded everything and launched a war of aggression against China.</p>
<p>The Eve of the Incident</p>
<p>Japan deliberately created the September 18th Incident, so the preparations were exceptionally meticulous. Relying on unequal treaties, the Japanese army had already obtained the right to station troops in southern Manchuria. On the eve of the incident, the Japanese troops transferred to the three northeastern provinces already numbered more than 20,000, plus more than 7,000 "reservists," 5,000 to 6,000 police officers, and several thousand "bandits" and "Mongol bandits" directly under the command of the Japanese army. Along the Anfeng Railway, the Japanese army had built about 80 artillery forts. As for the political aspect, in 1930, the Wakatsuki Cabinet colluded with financial capitalists. Under their instigation, they vigorously expanded militarism and appointed Yugaki Kazushige, an active advocate of invading China, as Governor-General of Korea, Uchida Kosai as President of the South Manchuria Railway, and Minami Jiro as Minister of the Army. From then on, the Japanese warlords raised their heads and acted more recklessly.</p>
<p>The Japanese invaders were even more meticulous, fearing that once they used force to invade China, it would provoke a joint resistance from the Chinese and Korean nations. Therefore, in July 1931, the Japanese consul in Changchun instigated Korean farmers to dig canals and divert water in Wanbaoshan, destroying tens of thousands of acres of farmland belonging to our people. Our local farmers protested and clashed with the Japanese police, resulting in many deaths and injuries. The Japanese further spread propaganda to the Koreans, distorting right and wrong and falsely accusing China of oppressing Korean farmers. As a result, riots broke out in Seoul, Incheon, Pyongyang and other places in Korea, and overseas Chinese were massacred. The Chinese government protested, and Japan made various excuses. A few days later, Japan used the disappearance of Captain Nakamura in the Hinggan Mountains as an excuse, falsely claiming that he was killed by our garrison troops. With the preparations in place, they launched an attack on Shenyang on the night of September 18.</p>
<p>The Scene of the Incident</p>
<p>The Japanese army destroyed the Liutiao Lake railway bridge on the South Manchuria Railway at night, claiming that it was destroyed by our army, and immediately began to bombard the Beidaying barracks in Shenyang with artillery. Three hundred of our garrison troops died unyielding. The garrison troops in other areas retreated due to the suddenness of the incident. The Japanese army advanced south towards Shenyang, while the northern route launched a fierce attack on Changchun. After occupying it, they advanced along the Jichang Railway and invaded Jilin. On September 21, they occupied the entire province without firing a shot. From September 18 to the end of September, all important towns in Liaoning and Jilin provinces were occupied. Jinzhou fell on November 18. From then on, the three northeastern provinces were subjected to the Japanese army's tyrannical power, but the volunteer armies organized by the people of the Northeast continued to fight against the enemy in secret. On December 26, the Japanese army attacked Jinzhou in three routes, completely driving the Feng army into the pass.</p>
<p>International Reactions and Investigations</p>
<p>On September 21, 1931, the representative of our government in Geneva wrote to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, requesting that the Council of the League of Nations pay attention to the Sino-Japanese dispute, and in accordance with Article 11 of the Covenant, requested the Council to "immediately take measures to prevent the expansion of the situation endangering international peace."</p>
<p>The Council of the League of Nations held meetings on September 30, October 13-24, and November 16 respectively. Finally, a League of Nations Commission of Inquiry was established, consisting of five members selected by the Chairman of the Council and approved by the two parties concerned. The qualifications of the members were approved by the Council on January 14, 1932. The list is as follows: Lord Lytton (UK), Major General Frank Ross McCoy (USA), Lieutenant General Henri Claudel (France), Count Luigi Aldrovandi Marescotti (Italy), Dr. Heinrich Schnee (Germany). On January 21, the Commission of Inquiry met twice in Geneva and unanimously elected Lord Lytton as Chairman. In accordance with the resolution of the Council of the League of Nations on December 10, both the Chinese and Japanese governments had the "right to send a member to assist the Commission of Inquiry." Subsequently, Japan sent Yoshida, the ambassador to Turkey, as its representative, and our representative was Mr. Gu Weijun.</p>
<p>The Commission of Inquiry did not arrive in the Northeast until April 20, stayed for about six weeks, and the Commission of Inquiry's report was not signed in Beiping, China until September 4.</p>
<p>At that time, among the international reactions to the Japanese invasion of China, only the United States' attitude was more obvious. In 1932, Secretary of State Stimson issued the famous so-called "non-recognition doctrine," refusing to recognize any results caused by force, and reaffirming the open-door policy. Britain made little comment. The Soviet Union, seeing Japan seize the Chinese Eastern Railway, did not interfere and later used diplomatic means to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway to Japan.</p>
<p>The report of the League of Nations Commission of Inquiry was signed by all members on September 4, 1932, and sent directly to Geneva for publication. Although the report stated respect for Chinese sovereignty, in order to take into account the actual situation, it suggested organizing an autonomous government in the three northeastern provinces, with advisors sent by various countries to participate together. At that time, Japan still regarded the report as waste paper and ignored it. At the end of the same year, the Japanese army continued to attack Yuguan and Rehe. On February 24, 1933, the League of Nations conducted mediation again, but Japan refused to accept it and announced its withdrawal from the League of Nations. The League of Nations then resolved not to recognize Japan's occupation of the Northeast.</p>
<p>New Reflections</p>
<p>After the Lugouqiao Incident, the all-out war of resistance began, lasting eight years and achieving final victory. According to the Cairo Declaration issued on December 1, 1943, it was determined that sovereignty over the three northeastern provinces would be returned to our country. In the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance" signed in August 1945, the Soviet government also recognized the three northeastern provinces as part of China, reaffirmed respect for China's full sovereignty in the three northeastern provinces, and reaffirmed recognition of their territorial and administrative integrity. The national humiliation of "September 18" was completely washed away, but when the national army went to accept it, unexpected complications arose, and the communist army obstructed the process, delaying the time and making the Northeast issue increasingly complicated. For more than ten years, the suffering of the compatriots in the Northeast has still not been alleviated. On the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the September 18th Incident, reflecting on the past and contemplating the present, one cannot help but feel deeply moved.</p>

<h3>Social Services: Responding to Readers</h3>
<p>Legal Questions</p>
<p>(1) Reversing a Wrongful Conviction</p>
<p>Wei Xinmin asks: (1) In the summer of the 30th year of the Republic of China, a communist Li was assassinated. His younger brother accused my nephew (who was only eighteen years old) of being an accomplice to the county judicial office. The judicial office, based solely on the plaintiff's statement, sentenced him to fifteen years in prison. Upon appeal, the sentence was reduced to seven years and six months. We originally intended to apply for a retrial, but due to economic constraints, the wrongful conviction was never overturned. He has now been imprisoned for more than forty months and is seriously ill in prison. The detention center refuses to allow him to be released on bail for medical treatment. What should we do? (2) My relative, Mr. So-and-so, lost his wife last year. It happened that his distant sister-in-law, Ms. So-and-so, was a widow without children. Later, due to mutual comfort, they fell in love and she became pregnant. If she gives birth to a son in the future, Ms. So-and-so intends to keep him as an adopted son. I wonder if the relatives have the right to interfere? Can the law provide protection?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers]: (1) (A) If the case has not been finalized and he is still in detention, the procedures should be handled in accordance with Article 114 of the Revised Code of Criminal Procedure. Check the first paragraph of that article, which stipulates that if a report is made requesting the suspension of detention, it cannot be rejected if the third reason is that the person is currently suffering from a disease and it is difficult to recover without bail for medical treatment. (B) If the case has been finalized and is being executed, the regulations in Article 471 of the Code of Criminal Procedure should be followed. If a person sentenced to imprisonment is currently suffering from a disease and there is a risk that execution will endanger their life, the execution should be suspended under the direction of the prosecutor until they recover or the event causing the suspension ceases. However, this is not bail for medical treatment, but rather sending the prisoner to a hospital or other appropriate place. (2) The current law does not have hereditary succession. The adoption of children should be done by the adopting person themselves. A spouse cannot adopt on their behalf after their death. Children born to Ms. So-and-so and Mr. So-and-so are children born out of wedlock and cannot be adopted.</p>
<h3>Infant and Child Health Care Hospital: Continues to Accept Infants and Children</h3>
<p>Original Site Converted to Pediatric Outpatient Department</p>
<p>The Shanghai Infant and Child Health Care Hospital has a large number of infants and children being fostered from various sources, and the original site is insufficient. It has now found a second hospital at No. 7, Lane 24, North Hai'ning Road, and continues to accept fostered infants and children from three months to two years old. Registration can be made at the main hospital at No. 173, Lane 1, East Baoxing Road. The main hospital has now been converted to a pediatric outpatient department, with specialized doctors rotating shifts for consultations.</p>
<h3>Tracking Down Missing Persons</h3>
<p>Yan Bingxing Searching for Son: Dear Editor, I respectfully write to you. My son, Yan Gaoyun, also known as Taisheng, is 29 years old this year. He is from Dongjiangpu, Dinghai, Zhejiang. He was originally learning a trade in the machinery department of Yisheng Foreign Company on Xiaoshadu Road, Shanghai. He went missing on August 18, the 26th year of the Republic of China, a few days after the outbreak of the Shanghai war, on Hengfeng Road, Zhabei. Later, he sent a letter through someone saying that he was working in the 88th Division's rescue team. Since then, there has been no news. It has been nine years. Yongxing is nearly sixty years old and has only this one son. If anything unexpected happens, my later years will be unimaginable! I am especially writing to request that you publish the original letter. If anyone knows his whereabouts and informs me, I would be extremely grateful. Respectfully, Yan Yongxing. Correspondence address: c/o Yanping Road 116, Shanghai</p>
<p>Searching for Brother Song Jie: Dear Editor, I originally lived in Daximen, Huaiyuan County, Anhui. I have three brothers. My third brother joined the army in the 26th year of the Republic of China and joined the student team. Later, he was reorganized into the teaching team and lived at Wuhan University, Hubei Province. Later, he was sent to Guilin and incorporated into the second regiment headquarters of the Army Signal Corps. In the 32nd year of the Republic of China, he joined the expeditionary force. It has been more than a year since the victory, but there has been no news. The old and young at home are restless day and night. I hope that close relatives and friends, if they know the address of Song Jie (Song Tongqiang), will kindly inform me by letter. Your merit will be immeasurable. Correspondence address: Song Pintang, Song Gaoduifang, Daximen, Huaiyuan County, Anhui. Refugee Song Tongming respectfully writes.</p>

<h3>My Views on the Roosevelt Library</h3>
<p>The Roosevelt Library, which has been promoted for a long time and is about to be prepared in Shanghai, according to a Nanjing dispatch in the 13th of this newspaper, was initiated by Director Zhu after returning to Nanjing and discussing setting it up in Shanghai. It was initiated by domestic peace-loving people and those who love peace after the victory of justice, to commemorate the great achievements of the international great man, former US President Roosevelt. In my opinion, since the library site has been decided to be in Shanghai, given the size of Shanghai and the large population, a "Promotion Department" should be established. "Branches" or "District Reading Rooms" should be widely established, like the "Reading Rooms" run by the British and American embassy press offices today, displaying the latest books, newspapers, and magazines. Reading time should be extended as much as possible, and working staff should adopt a rotational system. Public holidays should also allow the public to go and make full use of the facilities. Before the library is prepared and opened, large-scale public lectures by celebrities, current affairs exhibitions, current affairs forums, current affairs tests, etc. should be held from time to time to introduce the national conditions of China and the United States. Efforts should be made to ensure that the public has a better understanding of the international situation and the domestic political situation. After opening, methods of promoting friendship between China and the United States should be used as much as possible. A "Reading Guidance Department" (or "Reference Department") should be established to answer readers' questions and compile books and periodicals such as catalogs, indexes, lecture recordings, and collections of speeches for the public to refer to.

<h3>University Exam Results Announced Too Late</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: I had no choice but to come to Shanghai to take the university entrance exams. However, after taking the first exam, because the results were not announced for a long time, I had to apply to another school, otherwise I was afraid of losing the chance to study. However, the schools announce the results too late, not only wasting time but also consuming money. Among them, a certain joint university's exam has been going on for more than a month, but the results have not yet been announced. Even Jiaotong University is taking more than three weeks, which makes people anxious. Therefore, I urge the schools to announce the results as soon as possible. I would be very grateful. (A Candidate)</p>
<h3>Please Announce Loan Recipients Early</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: I am an orphan who lost my parents early in life. Fortunately, I was raised by my uncle. This year, I graduated from Husi Middle School in Shanghai and am now entering Zhonghua Vocational School. The tuition fee for this semester is huge, reaching my uncle's entire month's salary. My uncle is a clerk in a cloth store. His monthly income, after household expenses, is hardly enough to cover my tuition fees. Therefore, I applied for a loan from the Municipal Education Association. With school starting soon, I watched as my classmates took their payment receipts to the school to complete the admission procedures. I urgently inquired at the Municipal Education Association, and was told that the results would be known by the end of the month. If this is the case, I will be shut out of the school again. I beg the Municipal Education Association to announce the results early so that loan recipients can benefit in a timely manner. Thank you very much! (A Loan Recipient, Jin Zhenhua)</p>
<h3>Municipal Vocational High School Should Reduce Tuition Fees</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: We are a group of students from the Shanghai Municipal Senior Vocational School. Our parents are almost all public school teachers, and impoverished children from rural areas (many from northern Jiangsu). Because they cannot afford to attend high school and university, we, a group of poor students, transferred to this ideal school last winter. We thought we could study for free and learn some specialized skills to become mid-level technical personnel. Because we are poor, we did not dare to expect too much. In the first semester, the miscellaneous fees were 6,000 yuan, the food fees were 10,000 yuan, and the book fees were 30,000 yuan, which was enough. However, this semester, the first notification stated that the total miscellaneous fees were 46,000 yuan. But on September 8, another notice said that the amount would be determined separately, with dormitory fees of 30,000 yuan, construction fees of 20,000 yuan, teachers' appreciation fees of 30,000 yuan, miscellaneous fees of 8,000 yuan, and food fees of 100,000 yuan for the first month, and all must be paid in full at the time of registration, otherwise their student status would be revoked. This was truly a bolt from the blue, almost shattering our ideal dreams. Where can our parents find this huge amount of 250,000 yuan on short notice?</p>
<p>Now we only ask the former principal, Deputy Director Li Ximou, and the secretary of the Education Bureau, Director Wang Ruchang, to pity this group of poor students and reduce the tuition fees as much as possible to avoid the pain of dropping out of school. We would be endlessly grateful! (Students from the Shanghai Municipal Senior Vocational School, Textile, Civil Engineering, and Electrical Engineering Classes)</p>
<h3>Public Teacher Material Allocation Should Have Supplemental Registration</h3>
<p>The Shanghai public teacher material allocation registration took place during the summer vacation. All schools hurriedly completed the registration within the first prescribed date. However, some schools' newly appointed teachers were not confirmed until early September, and by this time the list had already been submitted, so the new teachers were not included. Therefore, there has been a request for supplemental registration. It is hoped that this low-priced allocation right can universally benefit public school teachers, and the authorities should make special arrangements to allow supplemental registration once. (Li Shi)</p>
<h3>Proposal to Convert Nunneries into Schools</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: Next door to my house is a nunnery. There are dozens of nuns, large and small, living there. They own a lot of real estate. Besides chanting scriptures all day long, they mostly gamble and extract commissions. Now, schools are suffering from a lack of school buildings, and tuition fees are so expensive. Many people are unable to attend school, and many people are displaced. Why not convert these nunneries into schools and allocate the proceeds from their properties to relief funds? Wouldn't this be "turning uselessness into usefulness"? (Neighbor)</p>
<h3>Are Military Rice Exempted?</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government previously received a provincial order to collect military rice, one sheng per mu (priced at 24,000 yuan per shi). Later, it was reported that the provincial council had requested and obtained an exemption, but the grain that had already been paid had not yet been returned. After a month or so, the county is now collecting local construction fees. According to the collector, the military grain that was previously paid can now be exempted. May I ask whether the higher authorities have actually exempted this military rice? If it has been exempted, why change the name? If it has not been exempted, it can be collected, so why change the name? (Hu Zhifu)</p>

<h3>Establishing European Peace: Still Far From the Goal, The German and Austrian Problems Are Complex and Difficult to Resolve</h3>
<p>— Translated by our Newsroom from the New York Times Magazine</p>
<p>Although the progress of the Paris Peace Conference has been quite slow, with the exception of the Trieste port and its hinterland issue, and the somewhat difficult Greek-Albanian border issue, most of the remaining issues have been gradually resolved. For example, the draft treaties with Romania and Finland have been reviewed and are ready for signing. Therefore, recent general opinion believes that the review of the draft treaties with the five former enemy states—Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland—is expected to be completed before October 15th. Diplomats from various countries can then travel to New York to participate in the United Nations General Assembly scheduled for October 23rd.</p>
<p>But is a new foundation for European peace being laid on this basis? The answer is that we are still far from this goal, because the most important German and Austrian issues have not even begun to be discussed. Even if they were to be discussed, they would certainly be more troublesome and complex, and by no means comparable to the treaty issues with Germany's five former vassal states. Therefore, we will examine the German question here.</p>
<p>The German question is important for two reasons: (1) Germany is the most populous and industrially developed country in Europe, and also the richest in coal production, so it is a crucial determining factor for the future of Europe; (2) Germany is the main target of open and covert struggles between the Soviet Union and Western countries. The London Times recently stated: "A divided Germany means a divided Europe, which could lead to all sorts of disputes." Today's Germany is divided and occupied by the four powers of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France. Although Molotov has said that the Soviet Union does not oppose German unification, the fact is that Germany will remain divided for a long time, due to disagreements among the victorious powers. If there were not such deep contradictions among the allied countries as there are now, the German question would not be so difficult to solve.</p>
<p>Divergences Between Soviet and American Views</p>
<p>The divergence between the views of the Soviet Union and Western countries can be said to have reached an extreme. Not only do they differ in their struggle for power and their political and economic goals, but they also have mutually contradictory explanations of the defects of the current world and how to correct them. The Soviet Union has its own political and economic theories, and to achieve its goals, it is willing to use any means. Therefore, in the Soviet-occupied zone, the four freedoms that we fought for in the war can be disregarded at any time, and all industry and commerce are placed under state control. This situation is, of course, incompatible with the habits and goals of Western countries, because in the eyes of Western countries, free trade is the most important condition for the stability of the world economic system and the establishment of peace.</p>
<p>At the same time, in the thinking of the Soviets, the capitalist world is bound to decline and collapse, so they want to use the various weaknesses of capitalism to accelerate the realization of the better world imagined by the Soviet leaders. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to find common ground between capitalism and communism to solve an important problem.</p>
<p>The differences in thinking between the Soviet Union and Western countries will, of course, have a very significant impact on the resolution of the German question.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's policy towards Germany was first explained by Molotov in Paris; he said that the Soviet Union hoped that Germany would become a strong country, maintain its status as an industrial nation, and did not approve of dividing Germany.</p>
<p>Mutual Suspicion</p>
<p>But although the Soviet Union advocates German reunification, it does not take consistent steps with Western countries. The Soviet-occupied zone of Germany has already been implementing the Soviet system to a certain extent, and there is no sign that this is temporary. If the Soviet Union hopes that Germany will become a strong, prosperous, productive, and unified country, as Molotov said, then it certainly does not want Germany to join the increasingly declining capitalist system. Therefore, some people believe that the Soviet Union's goal for Germany is to gradually control the entire country, in order to win the sympathy of the German people under the guise of national unity. The United Kingdom and the United States also hope for German reunification, but do not want Germany to implement the Soviet system, which would further expand the Soviet Union's power, eventually controlling Germany and even all of Europe.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is extremely difficult to find an appropriate way to solve the German question. The Soviet Union and Western countries each have their own views, and at the same time, everyone wants to promote their own views throughout Germany. This is the crux of the problem. Everyone is harboring suspicions about the other party, so everyone wants to win control of Europe.</p>
<p>The four foreign ministers have decided to discuss the German and Austrian issues before the end of this year. The world is watching to see how they will use their wisdom and courage to solve this issue, which is most crucial for the future of Europe. (South)</p>
<p>International Weekly</p>
<h3>Wallace's Speech Causes a Great Disturbance</h3>
<p>— Chu Yukun</p>
<p>Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes gave a speech in Stuttgart, emphasizing the U.S. policy toward Germany, which caused all sorts of speculation internationally about the U.S.-Soviet diplomatic war. And this week, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wallace gave a speech in New York, arguing that U.S. foreign policy needed to change direction, which not only caused a great disturbance in the U.S. diplomatic community, but also internationally. Hearing two completely different arguments within five or six days, all countries were panic-stricken, especially the United Kingdom, which has a direct interest in the matter, as if it were suffering from a fever, hot for a while, then cold for a while. Fortunately, President Truman issued a statement on the 14th, stating that there had been no change in U.S. foreign policy. This great disturbance began to subside, and countries were able to breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Wallace's Speech Is Pro-Soviet and Anti-British</p>
<p>Secretary Wallace gave a speech to the left-wing Citizens Political Action Committee in the United States on the 13th, the main points of which were four: (1) The United Kingdom is pursuing an imperialist policy in the Near East, and the Soviet Union is also pursuing a retaliatory policy, which is enough to drag the United States into war; the United States must adopt a clear and realistic policy to avoid war. (2) The United States should observe the world political situation with its own eyes, and not with a pro-British or pro-Soviet outlook; although Americans love the British, it is wrong for the United States to use the United Kingdom as the basis for its foreign policy. (3) The United States and the Soviet Union should divide their spheres of influence and not interfere with each other. (4) World peace requires China to maintain a neutral position, both politically and economically, and must be outside the two major spheres of influence; but China should open its doors to world trade.</p>
<p>The Great Disturbance Has Tended to Subside</p>
<p>Wallace's speech, in his capacity as a minister, was originally not worthy of attention in the United States, where there is freedom of speech. However, Wallace is the only surviving minister from the era of former President Roosevelt, and has always been regarded as a pro-Soviet figure, and has the ambition to restore Roosevelt's policies. Moreover, before the speech, Wallace had asked President Truman to approve the contents of the speech, and afterwards Truman publicly stated that he agreed with Wallace's speech. Therefore, it caused a great disturbance in the U.S. diplomatic community, and international public opinion was also greatly shocked. Because Wallace's speech, whether in spirit or in substance, contradicted and ran counter to Byrnes' speech in Germany. Therefore, Byrnes was "furious" when he heard this shocking news from afar in Paris, and Vandenberg also said, "I cannot obey two secretaries of state at the same time." From this, it can be seen that U.S. foreign policy has reached a crossroads, and President Truman still needs to make a decision on which way to go.</p>
<p>President Truman's statement was finally issued on the 14th. He said: "My initial statement was only to express support for Secretary Wallace's right to deliver this speech, but I do not intend to use this speech as a statement of our country's foreign policy." He also said: "The established foreign policy of our government has not changed, and no major changes can be made to foreign policy without discussion by the President and the Secretary of State and the leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives." Therefore, the great disturbance caused by Wallace's speech has tended to subside.</p>
<p>New Troubles Arise at the Paris Peace Conference</p>
<p>The Paris Peace Conference is scheduled to end before October 23, and various committees have to step up their work, preferably completing their tasks before October 5. Therefore, the atmosphere in the Luxembourg Palace suddenly became tense, and the representatives of the United Kingdom and the United States took the opportunity to adopt a diplomatic offensive: (1) The United Kingdom and the United States announced that they would give up their demands for reparations from Italy; (2) They opposed Bulgaria's territorial claims against Greece, and advocated the demilitarization of Bulgaria's southern border. When the Committee on Territorial and Political Issues of Bulgaria discussed Greece's proposed amendments to the Bulgarian border on the 13th, it caused a disturbance, and the representatives of the five Slavic countries left the meeting before the end. At the same time, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov seized the opportunity to launch a counter-attack against the Anglo-American bloc by using the issue of the port of Trieste. In a speech to the Committee on Political and Territorial Issues of Italy, he advocated the establishment of a "democratic autonomous government" in Trieste, and satirized the British political system as being out of step with the world trend, and that the British proposal for Trieste was no different from its implementation in its colonies.</p>
<p>After Molotov's speech was delivered, the Paris Peace Conference faced two major problems again: (1) the issue of the status of the port of Trieste; (2) the issue of the border of Bulgaria, which threatened to break up the peace conference; at the same time, it would also have a significant impact on the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>
<p>Palestine Is Even More Terrifying</p>
<p>Palestine has caused a great disturbance because of the illegal immigration of Jews, which has plunged the entire Near East into a state of turmoil. In order to solve this problem, the British authorities convened the Palestine Round Table Conference in London on the 10th of this month, inviting Arabs and Jews to gather together and calmly discuss this issue, so as to establish a solution that can satisfy all three parties; unexpectedly, on the opening day, no representatives from Arab and Jewish people's groups attended, making the Palestine Conference open in a pessimistic and depressed atmosphere.</p>
<p>At the conference, the Arabs opposed the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, and also opposed the partition plan proposed by the United Kingdom, which has invisibly fallen into a stalemate. At the same time, in the holy city, because of the riots of Jewish terrorists in various places, the Arabs went on strike for a day on the 14th to protest, and the situation in Palestine has entered a new stage. The past seven years of non-aggression between the two races of Jews and Arabs have been completely broken. Therefore, the Palestine issue is becoming more complicated, making British politicians and diplomats feel more "headache". (September 16)</p>

<h3>The First Aviator</h3>
<p>— Translated by Xi</p>
<p>Wright the First</p>
<p>Orville Wright, one of the Wright brothers who invented the first airplane, is still alive today, at the age of seventy-five. In American history, Wright is probably the only great inventor who can witness his invention transform the world into a different situation.</p>
<p>Orville Wright grew up in an era of fantasy, when children browsed ideal science fiction novels, dreaming of space ships and flying arrows. He and his brother Wilbur Wright accepted that fantasy and transformed it into reality. He shortened the distance between Washington and Tokyo to a short distance that can be reached in twenty-seven and a half hours. The secret of flight he discovered is not only the foundation of today's giant aircraft, but also the foundation of future rocket ships.</p>
<p>Wright became interested in machines in his childhood. He made kites for his friends. At the age of twelve, he became interested in printing presses, and at the age of seventeen, he built a practical printing press. Later, he also learned to make lathes and bicycles, and his results were very satisfactory.</p>
<p>Wright first had the idea of flying when he was lying in bed with typhoid fever in 1896. One day, his brother brought in a newspaper, reporting the news that German glider expert Lilienthal had died in a glider accident. This touched Wright's imagination, thinking that since Lilienthal was dead, someone else must continue his career. So he made up his mind to devote himself to the study of aviation.</p>
<p>The Wright brothers began to dabble in all books related to aviation, studying while experimenting. In the spring of 1901, everything was ready, and they began to do field flights. They chose the coastal beaches of North Carolina as the experimental site. They brought a biplane glider to "Kill Devil Hills", and took off into the air with the wind. By repeatedly experimenting like this, they learned to fly. They flew farther and farther, and for longer and longer. At this point, they further added a variable engine to their biplane. After several trials and improvements, they finally made the first test flight of an engine airplane on December 17, 1903, flying thirty-one miles in fifty-one seconds. After this news was published in the newspaper, it did not attract people's attention. They tried their best to get the government's recognition, but the result was disappointment.</p>
<p>They changed their strategy and went to Europe to promote it, and unexpectedly received a grand welcome from the Europeans. Politicians and royal families from various countries entertained them and feasted on them. King Edward of England and King Emmanuel of Italy personally watched them fly, and the German prince insisted on riding in their plane. King Alfonso of Spain sat in the plane and took a photo. They publicly performed flying skills in every capital city in Europe, and were celebrated and rewarded everywhere. When they returned to their hometown in the United States, their compatriots finally woke up, and they celebrated for two days in a row.</p>
<p>Although the Wright brothers received a grand welcome in Europe, they were not satisfied with this. Their ambition was to have the U.S. War Department adopt their planes. They constantly conducted various experiments. Whenever a new invention of aviation parts was added, Orville Wright would personally test it. On September 17, 1908, an accident finally occurred. The plane suddenly failed when landing, and another pilot died on the spot. Wright broke several ribs and femurs, but escaped death. A friend asked him: "Are your nerves affected?"</p>
<p>Wright seemed not to understand what he meant, and asked back: "Nerves? Do you mean to ask if I dare to fly again next time? … My only worry is that my experiment may not be completed this year."</p>
<p>In 1912, Wilbur Wright died of typhoid fever. Although Orville continued to conduct flight experiments until 1915, the situation was ultimately different. He lacked a capable assistant; he was lonely. After the outbreak of World War I in 1914, airplanes suddenly changed from a sports device to a murder weapon. As various military aircraft appeared one after another, Wright's name was gradually forgotten by the world.</p>
<p>Although Orville Wright is now seventy-five years old, he has not lost the perseverance that he had in his youth. He is very kind and humble. Although he has received awards and medals from universities and academic groups in various countries, he does not like to brag to others. He refuses to write an autobiography, and his photos are rarely found in newspapers.</p>
<p>But his great achievements will never be forgotten by the world. The late President Roosevelt once praised him: "Mr. Wright has given us these great defensive weapons—a new combat power, a new peace guarantee. Undoubtedly, he is one of the few great men of our time in America."</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Friendship</h3>
<p>— By O. Henry, Translated by Tao Liang</p>
<p>On a desolate street, a newly appointed police officer walked with dignity. This majestic posture was not meant to be shown to passersby, it seemed to be a habit he had developed. Because at that time, night had enveloped the earth, and from time to time there was a cold wind blowing, and a trace of drizzle drifting. Although it was not yet curfew time, there was not a single figure to be found on the street.</p>
<p>The police officer wielded his baton with various skillful and beautiful techniques, his two sharp eyes constantly patrolling the doors of various shops and residences, and the quiet roads. A few stores specializing in night markets revealed faint lights, and the rest were almost all closed. They relied entirely on flashlights to see the scenery in the distance.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he noticed a burly man leaning against the door of a store—in a dark corner. So the police officer slowly walked towards him, and the man also came up to meet him.</p>
<p>"Officer, is there anything wrong?" he asked the police officer, "I'm just waiting here for a friend I promised twenty years ago. Don't think this is a ridiculous thing. If you don't believe me, I can talk to you about it. Many years ago, wasn't there a 'Malandi' hotel here?..."</p>
<p>"That's right." The police officer interrupted the man's words, interjecting: "This hotel only closed down in the spring five years ago, right?"</p>
<p>As the police officer replied, the man struck a match to light a cigar. In the instant the match lit, the police officer recognized his face: a pale face, a pair of small, black eyes, with a wide scar next to his right eyebrow. The diamond pin on his tie reflected the brief light of the match.</p>
<p>"Twenty years ago tonight..." the man said, "Jimmy Wells—he was the best of my many friends—and I had dinner together at the 'Malandi' hotel here... Jimmy and I had a friendship that was as close as glue. At that time, I was only eighteen years old, and Jimmy was two years older than me... The next morning, for the sake of survival, I had to leave New York and go to the western part of the country. At that time, Jimmy refused to follow me, always wanting to stay in New York. So when we parted that day, the two of us agreed that twenty years later today, no matter what our circumstances, whether rich or poor; no matter how far away in the north or west, we would travel a long distance to come, and neither of us could break the appointment."</p>
<p>"Oh! That's very interesting." The police officer said lightly, "But, in my opinion, this seems too long, twenty years?… Do you know Jimmy Wells' current situation?"</p>
<p>"This—" The man was obviously stumped by the question, "At first, we corresponded with each other, but three years later, our information was cut off... I know Jimmy is a man of his word, and he will definitely come, unless he is dead." As he spoke, he took out a pocket watch with jewels inlaid on the lid from his pocket.</p>
<p>"It's three minutes to ten." The man said, "Twenty years ago, we parted right when the clock was striking ten!"</p>
<p>"You must be living more comfortably in the western part of the country."</p>
<p>"Much more comfortable than in New York. I only wish Jimmy could have half of my wealth... Alas! He lacked the spirit of adventure too much. Staying in New York made his life become rigid. If he could have gone with me to take a chance, maybe he would have become sophisticated and brave!"</p>
<p>The police officer waved his baton, took a few steps, then turned his head and said to the man, "For the sake of my duties, I'll go first. I hope your friend can arrive in time. Goodbye!"</p>
<p>"I believe he will come. Goodbye, friend." The man said affirmatively, watching the police officer walk forward along the sidewalk.</p>
<p>The rain was getting heavier and heavier, and the wind was also much stronger than before. The man who had traveled thousands of miles to keep an appointment—a twenty-year-old appointment—was still pacing back and forth in front of the store, patiently waiting while smoking a cigar.</p>
<p>Half an hour passed before a tall man in an overcoat ran over from across the street.</p>
<p>"Bob, is that you?" The tall man asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>"Jimmy!" He cried out in joy, piercing the quiet atmosphere nearby.</p>
<p>"Ah!" The man in the overcoat shook the other man's hand, "You are indeed Bob, I knew you wouldn't fail to come as long as you were alive. Twenty years is indeed a long time... It's a pity that the hotel has already closed, otherwise we could have gone in for another round of drinking, couldn't we? Bob, what impression did the west give you?"</p>
<p>"Not bad, my desires were satisfied there." He suddenly changed the subject, "Jimmy, I didn't expect you to grow so tall."</p>
<p>"Hmm!"</p>
<p>"Jimmy, you probably didn't have much success staying in New York!"</p>
<p>"Indeed, I'm just a small official in the municipal government now... Bob, let's talk about everything since we parted!"</p>
<p>The two of them walked excitedly, the friend who had been waiting anxiously, because of the development of his career! Excitedly recounting his success, while the other listened quietly, without saying a word.</p>
<p>When they walked past a corner, the neon lights from the company shone brightly, and the two of them couldn't help but look at each other at the same time.</p>
<p>Bob suddenly stopped moving forward, roaring at the man in the overcoat.</p>
<p>"Humph! You're not Jimmy, he wouldn't have been as ugly as you are twenty years ago."</p>
<p>"Friend, wait a moment, even a good person can become a bad person." The man said helplessly, "Bob, the police station has already received a telegram from Chicago about your matter. There are orders to go there once. Before you get to the police station, there's a patrol officer Jimmy Wells entrusted me to give you this note."</p>
<p>He unfolded the small note, his face turning even paler, and his hands trembling involuntarily.</p>
<p>There were not many sentences on that small note, and the handwriting was also very scribbled, obviously it was written by him temporarily. —</p>
<p>"Bob:</p>
<p>Don't blame me for breaking my promise. I came a long time ago. I understood who you were when you struck the match. For the sake of friendship, I couldn't bear to personally arrest a close friend from twenty years ago, who is now a wanted criminal. Bob, I have entrusted an undercover detective to settle this official business!</p>
<p>Bob, you think I can be called a friend, right! Jimmy Wells"</p>
<h3>Conversation of Cart Pullers</h3>
<p>— Carved by Knife Edge</p>
<h3>The Oldest Existing Chinese Poems</h3>
<p>— Cang Geng</p>
<p>The process of forming characters was still underway during the Yin Dynasty, as evidenced by unearthed oracle bone inscriptions. So, what are the oldest poems we can reliably trust today?</p>
<p>The "South Wind Song" and "Qing Yun Song" attributed to Emperor Yao in the book "Shizi" are obviously unfounded claims. The nursery rhyme attributed to Emperor Yao's time in "Liezi" is even less reliable, given that "Liezi" is a forged work attributed to Jin Ren. Therefore, it can be said that all poems attributed to the Tang, Yu, and Xia dynasties in various books are untrustworthy.</p>
<p>I remember that Mr. Wang Renshu, in his literary reader, cited the "La Ci" (Sacrifice Song) from the "Jiao Te Sheng" (Sacrificial Rites) section of the "Book of Rites" as the earliest ancient poem. The song goes: "Earth returns to its dwelling, water returns to its source, insects cease their activity, plants and trees return to their homes." Judging from the wording, it indeed possesses a primitive and simple style, reflecting the ancient people's concept of worshiping nature spirits. However, the "Book of Rites" is a book from the Han Dynasty, so the claim that the "La Ci" was written by Yi Qi cannot be established. At the very least, the "La Ci" is a work from the Zhou Dynasty. As for the "Yellow Emperor's Broken Bamboo Song" in "Wu Yue Chunqiu," it is nothing more than a forgery by later generations.</p>
<p>Therefore, many literary historians omit all existing poems before the Zhou Dynasty, simply regarding the three hundred poems of the "Book of Songs" as the origin of Chinese poetry. This is because they cannot find any earlier and more reliable poems.</p>
<p>In fact, the origin of ballads and language is parallel. When humans progressed to the point where they could use writing to record events and things, their language, like ballads, carried a sense of antiquity. Therefore, the recorded characters and phrases also carried rhythm. We can see this from the earliest "Zhou Song" poems in the "Book of Songs." The prose-like phrases of the Zhou Jin inscriptions are later than the "Zhou Song." Therefore, we only need to look in the oldest cultural relics and books to find the oldest Chinese poems.</p>
<p>Everyone considers the "Book of Changes" a more reliable book than the "Book of Songs," with its initial compilation dating back to the late Yin Dynasty. In this book, we can find very complete poems. For example:</p>
<p>The woman carries a basket,</p>
<p>There is no treasure.</p>
<p>The man cuts the sheep,</p>
<p>There is no blood.</p>
<p>What a beautiful picture, with words and rhythms so solemn and simple. There is also a love poem for newlyweds, which is also very complete:</p>
<p>The cranes cry in the shade,</p>
<p>Their chicks respond.</p>
<p>I have a good goblet,</p>
<p>I will share it with you! (尸 is pronounced bo)</p>
<p>Who can say that these two poems are worse than the three hundred poems of the "Book of Songs"? Therefore, the lines of the "Book of Changes" are the oldest existing Chinese poems.</p>
<p>Literary history and poetry history should begin with the lines of the "Book of Changes."</p>
<h3>Cherishing the Remaining Spring (One of the Dreams Continued in Yangzhou)</h3>
<p>— Hong Wei Fa</p>
<p>It was something that happened more than ten years ago. "Cherishing the Remaining Spring" - what an elegant and unique name, yet it was used by a very small teahouse in the north of the Yangzhou drill ground. It was always something that caught people's attention.</p>
<p>Inside the teahouse, there were only three or five tables, and only a few regular customers would come every day, leisurely reading newspapers, reciting poems, or playing chess. The owner of the teahouse was named Gao, and because of a physical defect, people called him Hunchback Gao. He seemed to take it in stride, because in his view, calling a cow a horse was neither an honor nor a disgrace. He managed the accounts while also taking the time to join some of the old customers in reading newspapers, reciting poems, or playing chess. It was said that he had already compiled many poems, but had not yet published them, but famous lines such as "Time is like ink, ground short; current events are like chess, with more captures" were recited by word of mouth. Wasn't that very fresh?</p>
<p>The furnishings inside "Cherishing the Remaining Spring" were all antique. In addition to some calligraphy and paintings on the walls, there were also poems written by customers in response to each other, as well as notices from certain customers soliciting poems, couplets, and riddle poems. Sometimes, the results of the solicitations were posted, along with the distribution method of the prizes. Speaking of prizes, they were also very elegant and unique. The first prize might be a pot of tea and a bowl of noodles, the second prize was a pot of tea and a bowl of dried bean curd threads, the third prize was a pot of tea, and those below the fourth prize received a few envelopes and stationery. Therefore, the atmosphere here was very refined, and those who wore short shirts and lacked ink in their bellies seemed to feel ashamed and dared not enter.</p>
<p>You could also eat meals in "Cherishing the Remaining Spring," but they were all very simple, just stir-fried meat, braised tofu, and the like. The owner would take the customers' needs into account very carefully, not making too much or too good, lest the customers couldn't finish it and spend too much. If customers had any special cooking methods, they could also personally go to the kitchen, select their own ingredients, and make their own dishes. In short, the owner always stood on the customers' side, fully expressing that he was not just in it for the money, like a great hermit mingling in the marketplace.</p>
<p>The owner was originally from Fujian, but had lived in Yangzhou for many years. His uncle, it was said, had worked as a record keeper in the Yangzhou government office in the late Qing Dynasty. Because he liked to use large dots when correcting documents, he got the nickname "Big Dot Gao." Later, his family accumulated some money, and the owner of "Cherishing the Remaining Spring," Hunchback Gao, opened a large noodle restaurant in the drill ground. The noodle restaurant was called "Keke Ju." Didn't Han Yu say in his "Preface to Sending Li Yuan Back to Pan Valley," "Gathered from the mountains, delicious to eat; fished from the water, fresh to eat"? This was the basis for the name "Keke Ju."</p>
<p>After Gao Hunchback opened "Keke Ju," because his family was also engaged in writing, the men of letters among the customers often received special treatment. This was probably the meaning of mutual appreciation. In addition to taking care of the store, the owner would talk about poetry and essays with these men of letters, which was very leisurely. Unfortunately, these men of letters were mostly not wealthy, and most of them had their tea and noodles charged to their accounts every day. As time went on, debts accumulated and there was little cash, and the owner finally had cash flow problems and could no longer sustain it, so he had to close "Keke Ju." After "Keke Ju" closed, those men of letters who owed money naturally felt a little bad, but if they wanted to restore the owner to his original state, it seemed beyond their power, so they pooled some money and had the owner open another small teahouse. It was named "Cherishing the Remaining Spring," and it really held an infinite sense of attachment to the past "Keke Ju."</p>
<p>The transformation from "Keke Ju" to "Cherishing the Remaining Spring" was like going from the full bloom of mid-spring to the declining beauty of late spring. "Cherishing the Remaining Spring" was lovable, but the spring light was always going to depart, which symbolized the fate of "Cherishing the Remaining Spring." Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, it closed again, following in the footsteps of "Keke Ju." The Tang Dynasty poem says: "The third month is exactly the thirtieth day, the spring light departs from my bitter chanting body; let's not sleep together tonight, before the dawn bell it is still spring." It is conceivable that Gao Hunchback, who loved elegance, would easily think of this poem when "Cherishing the Remaining Spring" closed, and would also have the emotions expressed in this poem!</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 36</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Judging from the facts, it is likely that the deputy captain has achieved his goal of escorting the distinguished guest; because two battlefield patrols have guided them back to the original defense, or to the Fengtai train station nearby. At the time, Fengtai was in the thick of battle, and no one could prove whether a distinguished guest had arrived, or had already taken a special train..." He frowned, thinking about the complexity of the problem.</p>
<p>"Then, maybe it was a car accident..." I offered him a way out.</p>
<p>"Yes!" He seized on my suggestion, wanting to vaguely conclude the incident. "I heard that the deputy captain had drunk an excessive amount of alcohol... The accident seems somewhat inevitable...?"</p>
<p>This was an unexpected turn of events. I never dreamed I would have such a convenient opportunity to exploit. I secretly rejoiced in my heart, and at the same time decided to have this guy accompany me to Changxindian.</p>
<p>Things proceeded smoothly: this guy accompanied me obsequiously along the way, first going to the scene of the accident to investigate. The entire route was free of obstacles; all the sentry posts and patrols knew that we were special investigators handling the accident. I took him to the triangular area not far from the intersection of the Pinghan and Pinglu railways, and said: I have other missions, please help yourself and wait for my call. If this guy hadn't encountered this disturbing event, making him lose his composure, it really wouldn't have been so easy to deal with him. In order to conclude this headless case, I called him the next day, telling him to end the case by claiming it was a car accident and submit a report. In this way, I also concluded a worry in my heart.</p>
<p>In total, from leaving Changxindian to returning to Changxindian, it was exactly thirty-six hours, with only five hours of sleep. The rest was spent on physically and mentally exhausting things, not to mention several dangerous moments, so I felt extremely tired.</p>
<p>However, what I kept thinking about was Hetsumi's whereabouts. Number 04 gave me a draft of a Feng telegram record, which only had one piece of information about Hetsumi, and it was still sent from the Tianjin branch, so it was certainly not very important. The other telegrams that were worth paying attention to were about Song Zheyuan's attitude and Qin Decun's statement, and another was about Zhang Zizhong's actions.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, based on these telegrams, Song Zheyuan was acting alone, perhaps due to a lack of vision, or perhaps he had other intentions. The others, such as Qin Decun, Zhang Zizhong, Wang Lengqi, and Ji Xingwen, were consistent, but there was no obvious united action. This could only be attributed to Song Zheyuan's single-mindedness, dreaming of an illogical peace plan. "Unable to command, yet unwilling to obey," was probably a good commentary on his attitude.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, while I was still in bed, Number 04 came to ask for instructions, saying that Engineer Wu was eager to see me, and said that he had already come twice yesterday. It seemed that there was a rather serious problem that he also wanted to discuss with me. Since he was an old classmate from Beiping and we had a good relationship, I immediately went to the guest room to meet him.</p>
<p>"You're finally back, you've had me worried sick!" Engineer Wu's opening remark was such an alarming statement.</p>
<p>"Oh," I maintained a calm composure, momentarily unable to think of anything that would make him worry about me.</p>
<p>"Look," he continued with a worried face, as if blaming me for doing something wrong, "Someone like you, a lone wolf, of course doesn't matter; but I have my entire family, old and young, with their lives and property here, you have to think about me too!"</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" These two headless remarks left me utterly confused, "What's wrong?... Let's all think of a way."</p>
<p>"Look, it's becoming more and more peaceful, "When the sky falls, there's still the roof ridge to hold it up." I said, Old Brother, you have to give me an idea."</p>
<p>Engineer Wu was called Dingyuan. He finished middle school in Beiping, and later went to the University of Hong Kong, majoring in electrical engineering. He was quite handsome and smart, but unfortunately he lacked luck. After graduating from Hong Kong, he couldn't get a job as an engineer, so he had to work as a mathematics professor at a poor university in Beiping, just getting by. It was hard enough to get into the Pinghan Railway, working as a deputy engineer. I heard that it took a lot of effort and many connections to get this position. But then, he happened to encounter the most "depressed" situation, with corrupt officials flying everywhere, and the railway bureau being so poor that it couldn't afford coal, and not paying salaries for years.</p>

<h3>September 18th</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The three characters "September 18th" are the most deeply imprinted in the minds of all Chinese people, even though that date is much earlier than January 28th, August 13th, and July 7th.</p>
<p>A song written by an anonymous author also helps us to constantly recall all the tragic events that happened on that day. The War of Resistance was won, and we, especially the 70 million compatriots in the three northeastern provinces, were overjoyed and almost delirious. Unfortunately, the old September 18th was not wiped away, but what is the situation in the Northeast today?</p>
<p>From September of last year, for a full year, what kind of life have our northeastern compatriots been living? Enemy expatriates and prisoners have not yet been completely repatriated. Who is taking advantage of the chaos to loot? Who is waiting for an opportunity to occupy the territory? We all know it very well.</p>
<p>I have northeastern friends, and frankly speaking, based on their character and behavior, I dare to say that the suffering of the Northeast will only be a short-term matter. Because they are all "resolute, clear about right and wrong, optimistic about the future, and believe in the government.</p>
<p>Some people compare the Northeast to the powder keg of the Far East. From a geographical point of view, its future position is indeed very important. The responsibility of the northeastern people is certainly heavy, and the government will not take it lightly. Our national defense line in the Northeast is not just a slogan; it is a mission that we need to complete in a down-to-earth manner.</p>
<p>Today, I would like to ask everyone to focus their attention on Changbai Mountain and the Yalu River!</p>
<h3>Pain After Pain - Our Northeast</h3>
<p>The Northeast is the treasure house of Asia and the lifeline of China. Please look at her products and resources:</p>
<p>Soybeans - Production accounts for 65% of the world's total, and its value accounts for 23% of my country's total export value.</p>
<p>Forests - Approximately 250 million acres, accounting for one-quarter of the country's total.</p>
<p>Railways - Approximately 6,500 miles, accounting for more than half of the country's total.</p>
<p>Products - Gold, oil, and iron production account for more than half of the country's total, and coal accounts for two-fifths of the country's total production.</p>
<p>Cultivated land - More than 150 million acres of cultivated land and more than 390 million acres of arable land.</p>
<p>Immigration - The population density in the Northeast is 28 people per square mile on average. If agriculture is improved, it can accommodate more than 30 million immigrants.</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago today, the mad Japanese army invaded the city of Shenyang, Liaoning. Under the "non-resistance policy" at the time, our army retreated step by step. On November 18, within two months, the three northeastern provinces were completely under the tyrannical power of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>After years of hardship, it evolved into a full-scale war of resistance. Before victory was about to come, the "Cairo Conference" declaration held in late November of the thirtieth year determined that the sovereignty of the Northeast would be returned to our country. After Japan surrendered, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance was signed on August 14 of the thirty-fourth year, which stated in Article 2: "The Soviet government recognizes the three eastern provinces as part of China, and reiterates and reiterates its recognition of China's full sovereignty in the three eastern provinces." The Northeast's re-entry into the embrace of the motherland has been confirmed, and the people of the country are looking forward to the government taking over the administrative power of the Northeast with joy. Unexpectedly, some people took advantage of the convenience of the advance of the national army into the Northeast to establish political power one after another. Therefore, the Northeast, which had just begun to show light, was once again covered by shadows, and the problems became more and more serious, complicated, and involved international relations, and no solution has been found to this day.</p>
<h3>Crying for the Northeast!</h3>
<p>— Suo</p>
<p>Some people participate in the war today, enter the Northeast tomorrow, issue military tickets the day after tomorrow, and start taking things a few days later; after a few more days, they want to stay for a long time and create a fait accompli, but they see that the situation is not right, so they leave in dismay! However, on the occasion of leaving, they are generous and give the scraped-clean land to a "democratic"-looking warlord. Then he sits on the plateau, smoking his pipe, and watching the fire in the Northeast. This fire is still being appreciated today.</p>
<p>Today is again "September 18th." We thought about these things: we can only shed tears in our hearts!</p>

<h3>Bachelor Hu Zongnan - Nothing is Easy in the World, Nothing is Difficult in the World!</h3>
<p>— You Fu</p>
<p>After twenty-two years of struggle, General Hu Zongnan is not only a famous and typical general, but also, among those who graduated from Whampoa, he is a unique and outstanding talent. Among the students from the first term and subsequent terms, almost no one can compare to him. (According to the first term, no one except Hu was a commanding officer or held the rank of general).</p>
<p>Hu is from Xiaofeng, Zhejiang. After studying at Nanjing Higher Normal School, he was angered by the darkness of domestic politics and determined to participate in the revolution, so he decided to apply to Whampoa.</p>
<p>How He Got into Whampoa</p>
<p>There is an interesting story about Hu's application to Whampoa back then; because Hu was physically weak and over thirty years old, the school repeatedly refused his application at first. Later, after his persistent pleas, he was allowed to register and participate in the examination; but because his grades were too poor, he failed. Hu was extremely distressed. He then personally met with Education Director General Wang Boling and requested permission to enroll. General Wang felt that his ambition was commendable, so he reluctantly broke the rules and allowed him to enroll.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Hu's talent was relatively poor. Most of his classmates were young people around the age of twenty, who were smarter than him, which Hu's middle-aged brain could not keep up with. As a result, Hu became the dumbest of all the students in the first term; not only was he dumb, but he was also very listless, often dozing off in class. As a result, the instructors and classmates all had headaches because of him, and unanimously believed that he was not worth training!</p>
<p>During the graduation exam, Hu was unable to cope. The instructor forgave his pain, so he gathered all the subjects together and gave Hu a question to answer. At that time, the instructor asked Hu: "What is the essence of what you have learned at Whampoa?" If he answered correctly, he would graduate; if he didn't answer correctly, he would not graduate. Hu immediately replied to the instructor: "Concentrate forces on the key points and develop them." The instructor was very satisfied that he had tactical thinking, so he allowed him to graduate; unexpectedly, later, Hu used this sentence in every battle, and thus achieved unlimited results. During the period of internal pacification, the Red Army was simply terrified at the sound of the three characters "Hu Zongnan," so as long as they encountered Hu Zongnan's First Division, the Communist army would immediately retreat. During the Communist Party's boasted propaganda of the 25,000-mile Long March, Hu Zongnan followed and pursued, leaving the Communist army with nowhere to go, and finally freezing to death in the snowy ice, and countless others being eaten by the Miao people in the border areas; even today, the Communist army admires General Hu's troop tactics. This may be due to his habitual use of that sentence from the graduation exam back then.</p>
<p>The Battle to Defend Wuhan</p>
<p>When the "August 13th" Incident broke out, Hu was once transferred to Shanghai. After the loss of Songhu, in the battle to defend Greater Wuhan, Hu commanded his troops to garrison Xinyang, preventing the enemy from crossing the line.</p>
<p>Later, he was transferred to Xi'an and took on the mission of defending the Great Northwest. For eight years, he has led hundreds of thousands of troops to sit in the Northwest, preventing the enemy from succeeding. The people of the Northwest call General Hu "the people's protector."</p>
<p>Hu not only guarded the Northwest, but also founded a military academy, namely the Seventh Branch School. He served as the director himself, training many junior cadres, so that the vast troops in the Northwest did not feel panicked about the lack of junior cadres.</p>
<p>He Doesn't Need a Wife</p>
<p>Although Hu's position is high today, he is still a bachelor; he doesn't seem to like getting close to women; many people have asked him about his marriage, and his answer is "My whole life is centered on my career." However, once, he went to Chongqing to attend a meeting of army group commanders and above. At that time, Madame Chiang was looking for a partner for Miss Kong Er without success, so she took a fancy to Hu and asked someone to explain her intention to Hu Zongnan, but Hu also politely declined! So, Hu still doesn't have a wife. This may be a factor in his rapid career development, but Hu is not distressed by this; on the contrary, he can focus on his career; throughout his life, General Hu has always insisted on one idea: "Dedicate himself to the country!"</p>
<p>Recalling his application to Whampoa and his student days, no one dared to believe that Hu Zongnan would have what he has today, and General Wang Boling, who has already died, did not dare to predict that at the time, but the facts prove that General Hu Zongnan is the leading general of Whampoa!

<h3>Promoting Domestic Goods, Impersonating Foreign Goods</h3>
<p>— Wang Wengu</p>
<p>Frenchman Daudet once said sadly in the last lesson: "Please don't forget the writing of your motherland, there will always be a day to turn around."</p>
<p>The enemy controlled us for eight years, and as a result, victory belongs to us. It must be said that this is because the enemy cannot control our souls - writing.</p>
<p>Some time ago, I saw in the newspaper: "The customs office's official documents will gradually be changed to Chinese." This means that the country has realized that we must respect our own writing.</p>
<p>However, at present, while we are promoting domestic goods, one hundred are actually genuine domestic cigarettes - Brandy, Beauty. Golden Dragon, Yuehua, Consul... It is not easy to find one or two Chinese characters on the price of cigarettes.</p>
<p>Absolutely domestic products - Three Sheep brand thermos bottles, ADK raincoats, Beweier hair oil, Fuller color shirts, it is not easy to find your own writing on the surface, if any, it is just a translation of foreign words.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we are promoting domestic goods, but on the other hand, we are asking the people to recognize: "BHK raincoats, MADE IN CHINA."</p>
<p>On the one hand, we are impersonating foreign goods, and on the other hand, we are telling people that they must love and use domestic goods. It really makes our group of consumers at a loss!</p>

<h3>Surplus Materials</h3>
<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>Recently, the public and teaching staff of this city, favored by the Materials Supply Bureau, were given some food. It is said that this batch of food was transferred to our country from the surplus materials of the US military. The public and teaching staff are quite happy to have this blessing.</p>
<p>The things distributed this time include DK two kinds, each kind a total of nine servings, and they are divided into three meals: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Therefore, in other words. A total of three days of food was distributed, and the cost was a total of 9,000 yuan. The content of the food is quite rich, including cigarettes, biscuits, coffee, canned food, etc. Although it is rumored that there is mold, this batch of materials is from 1940, and the most recent is from 1945, so there are different situations. Generally speaking, it is still intact.</p>
<p>This batch of things is certainly not expensive. But three days of food costs 9,000 yuan, even if there is often this batch of cheap things available, a month will cost 90,000 yuan. If a family is only calculated with two people, it will cost 180,000 yuan, then there are countless public and teaching staff who cannot afford this treatment, and it cannot be said that the public and teaching staff eating this batch of surplus materials is "aiming too high."</p>
<p>The food that the US military does not want, and our public and teaching staff still feel that they "cannot afford" it, the distance between them is too far. And it is too unfair for our public and teaching staff.</p>
<p>However, thanks to the blessing of the US military, the public and teaching staff can finally taste a little cheap American flavor, isn't that a great stroke of luck?</p>
