<h3 id="c1">軍委會調查統計局長　戴笠將軍確已遇難　乘機誤觸南京馬鞍山 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔太報訊〕關於軍事委員會調査統計局戴笠將軍乘機遇難之消息，自本報於廿二日首先透露後，本市即傳說紛起，莫衷一是。茲據本報記者各方調査結果，確悉戴將軍於十七日在由北平經靑島赴滬途中，飛機在南京西南郊板橋鎭馬鞍山，誤觸山頂失事殞命。戴氏屍體亦已於焚燬之飛機中認明，於廿二日在南京入殮。茲綜合本報南京特派員及自本市關係方面深得之詳情報道如次：</p>
<p>戴笠將軍於十七日晨由北平乘航空委員會飛機二二二號飛機起飛來滬，事前已有電致滬軍統局辦事處，云將於十七日午後抵滬，並擬於十八日主持滬辦事處之紀念週。該機由美籍駕駛負二人駕駛，同機起飛者有軍統局幹部人員七人，其中有軍統局人事處長　軒芳，副人，譯員二人，衛士二人，比外尚有我軍事機關長官將校共廿三人。</p>
<p>該機中午在靑島降落，俾機中人員進午膳。繼續起飛後，曾發出電訊二則，後以油箱漏油，無綫電通訊即與地面失去聯絡。</p>
<p>當該機離青時，駕駛員曾言及當時氣候報告甚爲惡劣，如萬一不能在滬降落，則擬在京降落，在南京仍不能降落，則凖備飛機返青島，因此所載汽油　量甚大，又備氣候惡劣在各處徘徊飛行之用。該機誤觸山頂後，燃燒之速及火勢之烈，諒亦因汽油儲量過多所致。</p>
<p>低飛選擇地點　誤觸山頂汽油燃燒</p>
<p>該機出發數小時後，即遇狂風大雨，據調査：該機曾在滬近郊徘徊以圖降落，然因機塲地面視綫惡劣，乃折往南京擬在明故宮機塲降落。然在京近空盤旋時，因濃霧重重，因視綫惡劣低飛選擇降落地點，不料誤觸山頂，機內汽汕即發火燃燒，發生近年來空前之飛機失事慘禍。　據本報南京特派員之調査，該機觸撞山頂，山頂尙有三處撞痕，該機墮落後，機門適壓於地下，視其情狀，當時機中乘客，即有能生存者，亦無法開啟機門，在汽油未爆發前之一霎那間逃出。據附近鄕民談，當時曾聞及悽慘之喊呌，惟以機中子彈爆炸，不敢近前營救。　滬京兩地機場人員，於與該機失去無綫電聯絡後，即急電航空委員會報吿。十七日下午即派專機四出尋覓，美空軍常局，及我空軍部隊，雖氣候惡劣，仍冒險出發偵査。十八日又加派飛機八架，參加偵査，然因濃霧瀰澡，視綫不佳，於十九日方在南京西南郊板橋鎭馬鞍山畔發現焚毁之機身。</p>
<p>滬辦事處聞訊　幹員趕往實地調查</p>
<p>本市軍統局辦事處幹部人員，聞訊後即趕往南京實地調査。軍統局參謀長李崇詩，亦親率幹員前往偵査，然因火勢猛烈，致乘客屍體幾皆不能辨明。然首先發現者有軍統局人事處處長襲軒芳之私人圖章，及衛士之圖章各一枚。後又發見戴將軍本人所有之自衛手槍，行李鑰匙，足證戴氏係該機乘客之一無疑。調査人員更在焦炭中尋得形似戴氏門鑲之金牙，更足證實戴氏確於機中遇害。戴氏平日常衣美國貨毛衫，調査人員，曾在一屍體身背上發見同樣之毛衫一件，乃即因此認明該屍係戴氏遺體。該屍腦殻破裂，一手亦毀，共餘乘客二十人中屍體可辨認者，祇有軍統局人事處長　軒芳，翻譯二人，副官一人，術隊二人，其餘人員屍體俱已燒燬。軍統局方面自出事點抬回屍體八具，並檢獲手槍七枝。</p>
<p>廿二日已入殮　生前友好均深震悼</p>
<p>戴氏屍體自辯認無誤後，即於廿二日移往南京中山東路逸仙橋畔軍統局辦事處入殮，當用絲綿分裝上下部，凑成整體，冠以禮帽，覆以綢衾，然後入殮。該局京滬兩處幹部人員，當時皆痛哭失聲，戴氏之生前友好，均皆震悼。又戴將軍遇難消息傳至重慶後，聞當局正在討論繼任人選。</p>
<p>戴將軍宇雨晨，五十歲，原籍浙江江山。文溪小五出身，杭州第一中學畢業，黃埔軍校第六期畢業。民十六七年在胡宗南部下任參謀，任職江蘇徐州。民廿二年在南昌繼鄧文儀任軍委會調査科科長，後該科改組爲局，氏擢昇局長。夫人毛氏，亦江山籍，在抗戰時期病逝上海，迄未續絃。母藍氏，年七十一歲，尙健在。戴氏出身世族，家境平庸，兒名藏宜，廿六歲，在江山辦建國中學。西安事變時，戴氏曾與蔣夫人宋子文等去西安。戴氏個性極剛强，見解敏銳深刻，行事富魄力。十餘年來忍苦耐勞，而自奉甚儉。</p>

<p>〔本報長春廿三日電〕今續有六機運一走接收人員一批，市內雖謠言紛紛，但多靜觀變化，置身滿炭大樓或步行街頭，特感到一種新感覺，然絕非不快之感覺。</p>
<p>〔聯合社瀋陽廿四日〕　國軍司令部今日接訊，新六軍從瀋陽南進的五十哩，已抵達鞍山，另一路國軍昨日午後進駐遼陽，待生力軍開到續向南進，該兩城共軍顯已後退。傳集中該區之　正　　爲數頗多，備有日方武器。又國軍自新民出發，分東南兩路向共軍佔據之盤山與營口前進，一俟進駐營口，國軍生力軍即可在該口岸登岸，據現象觀之，國軍現正悉力肅淸整個遼東牛島。長春悄况仍混亂，據瀋陽所接片斷消息，蘇軍已退出該城，事前未通知華方當局，長春與瀋陽間電話。電報及鐵路交通仍阻斷。長春方面最後兩架飛機，昨載華方高級官員四十人飛出，低級官員的四百人仍留該城。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿四日電〕據瀋陽來訊：國軍廿日進駐撫順，派定部隊常川駐戌，第五十二軍一部，正在遼陽附近挺進，新一軍一部已於廿一日進駐鐵嶺。四平街於蘇軍撤退後，共軍乘機進佔，該地現有激戰。</p>
<p>〔聯合社瀋陽廿二日電〕（遲到）新一軍仍徒步向前推進，記者在瀋陽古城外廿餘里處，目送此等曾轉戰印緬區之健兒，肩荷自動步槍與來福槍，衣美軍皮服，戴鋼盔，着高跟北極皮靴，列成長隊，在泥濘多車轍之道路開跋前進，雨點冷而驟念，打上面龐，顯示春到東北。此等士兵係在史迪威麾下訓練成爲勁旅，由美國西點陸軍大學出身之孫立人將軍統率，甫出瘧疾叢生之熱帶森林，而至北方苦寒之地，現復深人東北平原，向三百里外之四平街進發。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春廿四日電〕此間蘇軍，現已顯著減少，近一二日來之撤退工作，似趨緩遲，不復前數日之忙迫，而風聲鷄　之局勢，亦略見鬆弛。若干觀察家均認，長春蘇軍已經撤退之數量，或較現尙未撤者爲衆。　等相信，一旦蘇軍統帥部下令　最後撤退，則一二日內或數小時內即可全部撤完。</p>
<p>〔法新聞社莫斯科廿三日電〕官方頃宣稱：蘇軍不但業已退出瀋陽，且已自隣近區械撤退，而撤退員額亦已逐漸增加。</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科廿三日電〕蘇聯陸軍機關報「紅星」今日載稱，滿洲方面氣候轉暖，蘇軍正在加速撤退。此項蘇軍當初未能撤退，係由於中國政府兩次請求，嗣則又因氣候嚴寒，致使行軍困難，瀋陽及撫順兩處蘇軍，已完全退出。</p>
<h3 id="c3">中長路運輸國軍　蘇方現已無異議 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社長春廿三日電〕關於由鐵路運輸國軍前來長春接防事，蘇方已無異議，現正商洽技術問題。此事前由我國軍事代表團向蘇方正式提照會時，蘇方雖於覆文中原則上表示贊同，但其結論則等於「碍難照辦」，　經中長鐵路理事劉哲氏與該路蘇籍副理事長喀爾根氏懇談，喀氏初亦力持反對意見，但旋即表示同意。喀氏稱：該路車輛無多，將來或須使用北寗路一部份車輛，一般認爲，利用中長鐵路運輸國軍，在原則上，理論上均無問題，而所謂技術問題，則包括員工之調遣，車輛之撥配及鐵路破壞處之修復等。衆信，倘蘇方能在此等方面予我方若干便利，則進行必極順利。劉哲與喀爾根之初度談話，係在廿一日舉行，是日並曾就擇定中長鐵路員工問題誠懇交換意見，結果商定雙方會同簽發路員證，保障彼等之安全，另由劉氏以國府委員兼中長鐵路理事之資格，頒布告中蘇兩方路員書，文中措詞均曾徴得喀氏同意，該文有云：「我最親愛的中長鐵路中蘇兩方路員，你們當蘇聯撤兵，中國軍隊接防之際，能够站布自己的崗位，盡守職責，這是我最敬佩你們的。」據劉氏語記者，最近，中長鐵路員工以時局不靖，頗感慌張，但經與蘇方商定安定辦法後，已見平穩。劉氏並稱，截至目前爲止，理事會在職員工，除有二人以經委會關係不辭而別外，餘均照常辦公。劉氏囑記者寄語關內讀者謂，中長鐵路之中國員工，現已「頂住」。</p>

<h3 id="c38">春到江南 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>「杏花春雨江南」，這具有多少畫意詩情的江南春景。生活在部市裏的人，很少有機會看到杏花的，然而江南的春雨，却總　以體會得到；尤其是渦去這一個月來，整個江南都沈浸在春雨裏。潺潺雨聲，和江南人相伴有一個月了。久雨之後，在深深領會了江南春雨的滋味以後，看到嬌柔的春陽是可愛的。這是抗戰勝利後第一個春天，該是愉快的，興奮的；然而看眼前的局勢，總不能不於愉快興奮之中，多少感到沈重。翻開報紙所看到的消息，有蘊藏在聯合國機構的問題，有伊朗問題，有我們的東北問題，還有迎篇像春意惱人那樣的記載。關於聯合國機構，我們看見有如此的報道：「衆自睽睽之安全理事會第二屆會議舉行日期，距今僅三日，英代表賈德幹及史退丁紐斯，正在加强外交戰，昨今兩日不斷與各國代表會商，俾在討論議程第一項時，能以多數票否決蘇聯請求延期開會之提案」，關於伊朗則曰：「伊朗於慶祝新年時，空氣緊張，德黑蘭遭受政變之威脅，有一觸即發之勢：據稱，左翼民主黨正計劃推翻政府。」關於東北，據本報長春廿二日電謂曾以八機運載接收人員自畏春撤離至錦州；又據另電，謂遼陽營口間之平原地一帶，近一週來結集來歷不明之武裝部隊幾及十萬，頭目及其幹部多操山東及蘇北口音，所用武器多爲日本製造，且附有重砲甚多。</p>
<p>然而令人感到意味深長的却是另一段不甚爲人注意的消息；其文如下：「據郵政管理局員責人談稱，本市郵區所屬江北麒麟鎭·三陽鎭·北新鎭·久隆鎭·及啓東一帶地方，突於上月初句被共黨「交通局」派員前來「接收」，將全部郵工驅散，並發行毛澤東郵票。現本市與該處郵路，業已中斷。這事發生於上海市郵區內，各該地距上海市中心，也不過二三十哩。「杏花春雨江南」，都市裏的人不常看見杏花，然而杏花却有時培積在都市內私人的庭院裘。離開紙醉金迷燈紅酒綠的上海僅二三十哩的地方，又在發生着並發展着怎樣的局勢。</p>
<p>與上海隔揚子江相望的南通，據本報一位讀者從南通寄來的信上說：『日寇屈降以來，南通人滿以爲可以過一點快活日子，豈知適得其反；四鄕共軍虎視耽耽，任何時間都有被呑噬的可能，所以人民都在戰慄中過生活，尤其是鄕區的人民。國軍進據縣城以后，豁免了一年的田賦，豈知鄕區的新四軍，却強派公糧，所派數目，比豁免的糧賦，不知要多上多少倍，佃農所得米糧幾悉數爲新四軍派去，騙去；又復發行「抗幣」，以此一文不値之紙片，換去大量棉花，布匹；然後派人將棉花，布匹，運至南通或上海，購回自行車及其它軍用品，於是老百姓一年以血汗辛勤可得的物資，悉數變爲印有毛澤東像之「抗幣」……上面的政治協商對於他們毫無影響，反而變本加厲，禁止學生出外求學……南通附近一帶共軍之惟一權威新聞爲「江淮導報」，前曾載有：「×月×日國民黨軍隊××人，進犯石港，被我守軍擊退，在于家圍激戰一晝夜不支，潰退馮家渡」，其時，筆者適在石港，不但未有此等事，且石港一帶，根本並無「馮家波」地方，石港人看後哭笑不得，而別處共黨却以爲有報可證，又是國軍在不遵守停戰協定……」。</p>
<p>這幾天周恩來氏在重慶發表了指摘國民黨二中全會破壞政協協議的談話以後，悄悄地飛回延安去了；在陪都召開的國民參政會，共黨代表也避不出席。觀乎本報讀者從南通寄來的忠實報道，可知陰謀破壞政協成果的倒底是誰。春雨江南使人感到煩鬱；但在政治方面，何嘗不也有春雨惱人之感？春到江南，江南人又應該有怎樣一種心情。</p>

<p>林森路</p>
<p>五六八號大昌首飾號，昨日下午三時三十分許，有美兵名達爾者，入內聲稱，欲購鑽戒，當由店夥吳毓之取出大小鑽戒五隻，任其選購。該兵即選就三隻，計人字三十一分四小粒鑽戒一只，鳥字三十一分小鑽戒一只，商字二十三分一粒小鑽戒一隻，估計値法幣四十五萬元之譜。</p>
<p>該美兵</p>
<p>審視良久，一一帶在指上，旋忽奪門而逸。店夥吳毓之隨後緊迫，幷沿途大呼捕盜，該美兵由林森路至南成都路折至蒲石路時，有八十三號警長李紹基偕四九五〇號警士巡邏抵此，奮勇追趕。其時美兵聞後面人　鼎沸，捕者愈聚愈多，乃竄入和合坊，因該弄一面大門不通，復回出在奔，</p>
<p>竟開槍</p>
<p>二響拒捕。一彈擦傷李警長之手部，幸尙輕微。後面第四九五〇號警士見　長受創，遂拔槍還擊三槍未中。該美兵又越重慶南路穿過蒲石路至鉅鹿路九星大戲院後面弄內，但知此弄又不通。至此，自知無路可逃，即開槍自戕，彈由右太陽穴貫穿左太陽穴，立時倒地，氣息僅屬。後經呂班路美軍憲兵隊據報，立派憲兵多名，乘車趕到，將該美兵舁送海格路四〇〇號美陸軍醫院，醫治無效斃命。至受傷之李警，即入警察醫院就醫。</p>

<p>— 本報記者蒼龍</p>
<p>假使你不會健忘的話，你終該記得起八年前上海的道路。南京路的光滑，霞飛路的坦直，民國路的寬敞……可是敵僞盤踞了八年，鐵蹄過處，路面遺留下了塊塊創傷，魔掌及處，車軌都給刦奪以去，賸下的是那末醜惡的深槽……要怎樣補舊整新呢？要怎樣開拓新路呢？尤其是在上海口口聲聲被稱爲世界第一流大都市的今天，道路平整的起碼條件，怎也要拼着少年中國的吃奶氣力，來完成也？</p>
<p>據工務局說：自從去年九月十二日接管了路政以後，就成立了測量總隊。測量結果，全市道路的長度，相當於上海到南京距離的三倍，的摸是一千公里的光景，這一千公里的路面，居然有三十四萬平方公尺的面積給損壞了。工務局開始工作後，把全市　分成六大工區，這些損毁的道路，各工區都經陸續整修，據說已有二十萬平方公尺面積的壞路面給補好了。</p>
<p>可是物料短缺，要補的路又太多，目前補大路用的材料，還是向上海煤氣公司買來的臭柏油，只能應付冬天的補路工作，一入盛夏就要融化開來。小路僻處，就只能拿碎石子，撒滿窟窿，勉强供川，經不起重噸軍用卡車幾次駛過，窟窿又出現了。所以舊的創傷剛補好，新的創傷又接着出現，循環不息，不注意的人，是不會覺察到修路工作正在進行。</p>
<p>什麽時候才能開始把上海的道路，大規模的整修一下？工務局道路處長吿訴我說：這時候不會太久了，因爲最近該局向美國定買了一大批瀝淸植油，預計四月底可以運到，原料一到，澈底的整修工作，就可實行。</p>
<p>現在上海的道路，就其建築的材料而講，大致可分四類，就是：（一）水泥混凝土路，（二）柏油混凝土路，（三）彈街路，（四）煤屑路，第一種路建築成本最大，也最經久耐用，這種路本市現在並不多，例如寗海西路（舊華格臬路）的一段。這種路對氣候的熱冷，很會引起漲縮，所以每隔相當距離，都要留下一小段間隙，備作伸縮的餘地，第二種路的建築成本也不小，現在損壞的情形也最重，主要的幾條這路像南京路，金陵路，林森路，中正路等，都是這類道路的代表作。第三類的彈街路，是用普通大小不整的石塊拼凑以成的，這類的路，南市比較最多，路面十九高低不平，最不受路人和車輛的歡迎，最後的一種煤屑路，則以郊外較多了。</p>
<p>拓寬道路的計劃，目前首吿實現的，只有南京西路跑馬廳北面的馬路，已經拓寬成二十公尺，至界路拓寬至三十五公尺，和浙江路拓寬至二十公尺的計劃，因爲牽涉到拆除房屋的問題，在正鬧着屋慌的今天，這計劃無形中，遭到了擱淺的命運，不過猜測當局的意思，大致將站在爲大部份市民謀福利的立足點上，來推行整個的路政，聽說今後整個都市道路的設計，要拿現有的飛機塲，車站，碼頭爲據點，而把道路的分佈，編排，給配合起來！</p>

<p>自中行配售黄金以米，金融趨勢，漸形穩定，投機　乃轉移目標，拉抬華洋股票及公債，商品方面，則以米糧步漲，刺激最大，白粳常盤旋於三萬一二千元，麵粉以客銷頗殷，價亦緊俏，兵船牌曾叩萬元大關，食油一度挺至六萬三四千元，後即回至六萬關邊，茲分述槪况如后：</p>
<p>黃金　上週烚赤趨勢平靜，惟週一開美國建議提高黄金說，同時中行又以一六二萬配出，人心向上，盤旋於一六〇萬至一七〇萬之間，週二至週五趨勢疲軟，中行於週一起，配價始終一六〇萬元不變，金業納胃，並不踴躍，黑市價已較配價爲低。</p>
<p>外幣　週一美鈔在二千元外徘徊，因美匯率穩站原盤，人心閑散，供求甚鮮，僅錢兌業略有買賣，週二至週六退至二千內，於一千九百元外掙扎，榮辱難分，港票老貨穩站四百四左右，新貨（即一九三六年及一九三七年二種）行情突俏，週三起在本市某銀行做手下，引人注意，洋行乘機扒吸，卒因籌碼短缺，頓起漲風，截止週六，猶節節步昂未已，出二百大關而至二百三十元左右，已超過老貨對折行市。</p>
<p>統債　統一公債週一至週五問津乏人，起伏狹隘，丙種在一千六百元外徘徊，僅三五十元上落，至週六因投機者靜極思動’買風頓起，價吿堅挺，丙種曾出二千元外，後退至一九二〇元，甲乙種升至一千〇五，丁種升至一千一，戊種升至一千三。</p>
<p>股票　黄金穩定以後，投機帮脫手換股，於是股票市塲大露鋒芒，市勢賡續挺升，週二外股因浮多斬結，一致步降，週三華股走勢至爲穩健，尤以午後爲鋒銳，紗廠自越四千關後，一路邁進，其他各股亦均跟上，外股在一片買聲中，昂騰亦多，週四華股買氣彌漫，市勢由大型股轉向小型股，景福及勤興均曾突破三百元大關，新光漲風亦烈，外股散戶吐出，價略回小，週五華股初開略吿小挫，後以大戶拉提，三小熱又掀起猛烈漲風，大型股漲勢較平，外股人心振奮，又向高峯邁遇進，週末廣帮吸納華股不懈，拉提仍力，復創高價，外股漲勢不一，中以亞洲及會德豐爲較烈。</p>
<p>現紗　在上週問，初承前週末漲風，加以廣東帮採辦頗力，走勢極俏，價在高峯盤旋，六十支日光雙股細紗曾高至二百八十萬，入後粤漢等主要客帮採辦雖仍不寂，但以紡建公司接收日商之紗廠日夜開工，積極生產，壓力較重，故漲勢漸弱，全週以星期一之六十支日光二百八十萬爲最高，星期四之十支嘉禾五十一萬爲最低，除廿支特雙馬獨昂外，各紗一致俱軟，尤以四十二支藍鳯暴跌十七萬爲最鉅。</p>
<p>布市　因客帮與門莊銷路不旺，廠家出數遞增，市上供給籌碼充裕，市勢連日在疲途中，各牌一致均疲三千至五六千不等</p>
<p>花市　因紡建公司接收日商之紗廠，需用原料甚切，採辦細絨原料頗鉅，故市價尙堅，獨周浦籽花去化呆滯，獨跌七千元之譜。</p>
<p>米糧　週初食米市况，因春雨連綿，又吿上漲，麵粉食油，均吿俏利，食糖賡續下游，本廠棉白尤爲黯淡，翌日食米以產地報漲，續升二千元，週三天氣放晴，食米到貨特暢，市况轉趨緩和，一致下挫，麵粉亦帶軟，雜糧方面生仁俏勢特盛，疾升三千元左右，週四食米來源增旺，市勢續呈鬆懈，上等跌五百元，中下等跌千元至千五百元不等，麵粉平庸，食油到銷相埒，小挫五百元，食糖湧到，市勢不振，週五食米市况又因陰雨，而現俏勢，各漲數百元至千五百元不等，麵粉去化活躍，亦好三百元左右，雜糧一致下挫，食油到湧銷滯，展開跌風，週末食米初堅後疲，做價大部與昨相仿，麵粉以外埠價高，又俏四百餘元，雜糧方面黄豆轉好三五百元，生仁榮辱互見，食油盤跌數百元，豆餅亦挫數十元。</p>

<p>票據交換制度，在戰前由於環境之特殊，未能集中，如外商銀行票據由匯豐銀行及中國銀行共同主持交換，華商銀行由上海銀行業聯合準備委員會所設之票據交換所主持交換，錢莊則由錢莊業聯合準備庫主持，勝利後，經財政金融當局竭力改進，摒除分割制度，實行集中交換以來，行莊稱便，成績殊佳。</p>
<p>交換行莊一五三家</p>
<p>上海票據交換所係銀錢兩業原有票據交換所合併，另組織委員會主持一切業務，而以中央銀行代表爲主任委員，四行兩局及外商銀行一律參加交換，所有各行莊間交換餘額之劃撥結算，集中於中中央銀行辦理，截至上週爲止，票據交換號數共有五十號，即直接交換銀行有三十五家，錢莊十五家，至未派得交換號委託代理交換之銀行有六十三家，錢莊三十三家，信託公司七家，其中派得交換號數之行莊，均直接向中行開戶，以憑辦理交換餘額之劃撥結算，未派得交換號數之行莊，則向交換所開立往來戶，將每日交換所餘頭寸，由交換所立戶如數存人中行，手續簡便，管理統一。</p>
<p>交換金額日有增加</p>
<p>該所自經改進集中交換後，每日交換總額，當日即可査出，且可隨時察知市塲變動之實况，如本年二月份票據交換命額爲四五九·二五一·二六六·二七〇·六二元，代理交換票據金額二〇八·四五三·〇三四·七一九·六四元，合計金額六六七·七〇四·三〇〇·九九〇·一六元，一月份票據交換金額三〇六·九七二·〇七〇·九四五·八六元，代理交換金額一二九·八六八·九三六·七五六·五九元，合計金額四三六·八四一·〇〇七·七〇二·四五元，故二月份較一月份增加達百分之五十，此足反映二月份市塲資金流動性擴大，投機猖獗及物價之波動，至最近二週來，每日交換票據張數平均在一萬張左右，交換金額亦日有增加云。</p>

<p>— 田和卿</p>
<p>頃讀本月十七日貴報第三版載有一叚本市工務局檢査工廠鍋爐的一叚新聞，內稱：「市工務局爲防止各工廠發生火災，以保障廠塲，鄰屋，工人以及一般市民之安全起見，曾派員分赴各廠調査鍋爐，電氣設備及機器，佈置地位，遇有危險性之廠塲設備，均隨時囑令遷移或改善，截至二月底止，已檢査工廠四百餘家，登起鍋爐八百餘只……」讀完這叚消息，覺得非常詫異，工務局爲求工廠之人與市民安全來執行檢査，是然是一件迫切需要的工作，可是在行政系統上究竟如何隸屬，却是一問題。</p>
<p>據報上所載消息工務局所執行的檢査工作，都是有國家法律明文規定，必須同特定的工廠檢査機構來執行的，而這一件工廠檢査工作，在抗戰以前，已由上海市工廠檢査所專可共事，行之有五六年之久，抗戰期間在大後方山社會部直接訓練合法人員，派往各工業區執行檢査工作，從未中斷，想必現任工務局負責人，對於工檢系統，總不會隔膜吧！</p>
<p>工廠檢査工作，在各工業先進國家裏，都是認爲一件非常重要的行政，各國政府對於這件工作特別審愼，執行亦非常嚴厲，並不是一二位僅僅懂工程的學者可以勝任，因爲它涉及的範圍，非常廣泛，因此國民政府對於這件工作特別慎重，自民國十八年後絡續公佈了工廠法，工廠法施行條例，工廠檢査法，及工廠安全衛生條例等，至民國二十年前，實業部曾經在本市舉辦工廠檢査人員養成所，訓練一批介法的檢査員，派往各省市去執行檢査工作，至民國二十二年，中央爲求更進一步的推行檢査工作，特別在首都成立中央工廠檢査處，來專司其事，本市社會局在民國二十年九月，成立專股，委派訓練合格人員，從事檢査工作，這不是一件普通的行政工作，民國二十二年時，本市公用局亦擬對鍋爐檢査，加以染指，當時爲法統問題，在市政會議上有過一段爭論，結果這是法律所賦予工廠檢査員的一種特定職權，當然應該由工檢員來執行，同時爲工廠裹的消防問題，社會局也曾經與公安局有過一叚筆墨官司，不料現在的工務局要把十幾年前的舊案，重行推翻。</p>
<p>工務局做今日的檢査工作，也有它一叚歷史，這個演變，還是從僞政府時代遺留下來，推溯到民國二十六年國軍西撤後，當時公共租界工部局當局也有工廠檢査工作，爲最近回滬的邢德女士所王持，太平洋戰事發生，日軍進駐租界，工檢工作，由日人負責，租界由僞政府做過一叚傀儡把戲的收回工作以後，工部局改名第一區公署，常時檢査工作，曾由工業社會處負責，到去年上半年第一區公署取消，原有工業社會處的檢査工作，就莫明其妙地把它歸併到工務局裏去了，勝利後，從重慶飛來的接收火員，把工務局全部案卷連同人員一齊接辦下去，蕭規曾隨，依樣畫葫蘆的繼承下去，於是這件有國法明文規定，必須由訓練合格的特定工檢人員所担任的工作，也一仍其舊，由工務局來執行了。</p>
<p>作者並不反對實施工廠檢査工作，可是這一件工作，任過十多年來所樹立起來的一種制度，一個法統，無論政府和人民，是都應該邀守的，尤其是法治的國家裏，更應該維護法統，絕對不應該來破壞，作者純粹是爲着愛護工廠檢査的制度，來提醒政府常局注意這件工作的法統，假如站在本市工業界的地位來講，也希望管理工廠的主管官署，最好是盡量地集中在一個官廳，由它來主持，來管理，在政府可以收到事半功倍的效果，在工廠也可以免除許多無謂的麻煩，希望工務局把這件檢査工作，早日歸還給合法的機構去執行。</p>
<p>爲移轉這一件工檢權的法統問題，有一件非常重大的先決問題，必需解決的，那便是上海各工廠檢査機構問題，應當趕快求解決，早日把它恢復起來，希望社會部不單對於上海的問題，就是全國的整個工檢系統，也應該從速規定，早日確立，使勞資雙方都有所依歸，不至於鬧出類似的法統問題來。</p>

<h3 id="c74">首都中學生　確定學籍 <a href="#c74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京專訊〕抗勝之後，首都中學校學生之學籍，陸續整理，現已大致確定。特分柝言之：</p>
<p>大學先修班　收容先修</p>
<p>（一）已停辦之公部設立臨時大學先修班，收容先修，至本年暑似爲止，成績及格，暑後亦可分別插入正式大學讀書。（二）僞組織時所辦之國立中等數校肄業生，由敎部設立國立臨時第一第二第三中學三校以收容之，其學籍，於人學考試時，視程度分班，並於寒假時又加以嚴格考定。（三）市立中小學與私立中小學敎育，繼績辦理未輟，惟市校校長人事於抗戰勝利後冬所更動調整，各校多曾於寒假考試時，寓有甄試作用，故退學留級降級者紛紛。</p>
<p>中學進修班　實際修習</p>
<p>（四）向在自由區讀書，因環境而流亡失學之靑年，敎部招訓委員會，（現改爲靑年復學就業輔導處，）設有南京靑年訓導所，（上海·安徽·北平·亦有類似之靑年復學就業之校所，）收容而敎育之。其中分高初各級，有中學主要課程之講習，並多公民及體育訓練。該所在前曾按期將　訓靑年分發至國立臨中各校讀書，現聞三月間，即將訓導所改爲由學進修班，將課程擴充與一般中學一致，仍分高初各級敎學，改班之後，與一般中學無異，學生即規定正式學籍。該班現有學生四百人，將來視校會容納情形，可擴充至五百人，其進度則因不放寒暑假，實際修習四個月爲一期，遇必要時，亦可將學生分發至公立中學插級云。（　）</p>

<p>— 本報重慶廿一日航訊　特約記者趙浩生寄</p>
<p>二十一日上午，是經濟報告和詢問，下午四時，行政院宋院長在勝利大廈舉行茶會招待參政員。</p>
<p>大廳中，據舊四排長桌，正中一短排座位，禮堂四壁，花花綠綠，華燈初亮，照耀着潔白桌布，發光的刀叉，真是洋洋大觀。</p>
<p>劉文龍老先生到得最早，四時許，幾部大交通車午後開到了，會塲中馬上大熱鬧起來，不少參政員們，趁着這個時間，拿出自己的提案，請別人簽名，不少的人，還在津津有味的談着上午經濟報告詢問的一塲風波。</p>
<p>濟濟一堂　熱烈握手</p>
<p>宋院長在門口出現，還是一身暗綠色西服，項間圍着一條白絲圍巾，順着長桌，同每一位參政員熱烈握手，最後走到門口。</p>
<p>在禮堂進門處，邵力子居左，宋院長在右，翁文瀕，和穿着長袍馬褂的蔣夢麟和宋院長站成一排，分別的迎接着一個個陸續到來的人。</p>
<p>禮堂中坐得滿滿的了，不要主人招呼，大家自動的用點心，宋院長邀請幾位在正中的一排位置上坐下，宋院長居中，左邊是江庸，李璜，錢新之，吳潤初，右邊是黃炎培，褚輔成，俞飛鵬.邵力子和翁文瀕，坐在長桌的兩端。張厲生，朱家驊，都算是半主人，分別在各桌中間坐下，王世杰算是客人，也置身在人羣中。</p>
<p>主人站起來說話了，全塲熱的鼓掌歡迎。錢新之因爲左手拿着烟鬥，只好用右手舉起攵子，敲打着他面前的盤子，表示歡迎。</p>
<p>主人舉杯　向衆祝福</p>
<p>宋院長用一口純粹的上海話發言，他說上一次招待參政員們就沒有講話，這一次本來預備還是不講話的，但是剛纔邵力子先生對他說，今天好像已經造成了要講話的形勢，非講不可了。他說明天上午大會是他的政治報告，爲了避免大會上的開工，所以他今天請大家在這裏先隨便談談。最後，他舉起茶杯，給大家祝福。</p>
<p>禇輔成在主人髮言後站起來，他說起物價問題的嚴重，希望宋院長趕快拿出辦法來解決。說到上海的封條和金條約活動，說到杭州買不米，他不斷的揮動着抓在手裏的餐巾，加重着他的語氣。</p>
<p>黃炎培氏　且走且講</p>
<p>江庸站起來，照樣的舉起杯子，向主人致謝。曾似乎已經走到結束階段了，黃炎培忽然在這時候站起來發言，他照例的先向大家打個招呼，但他的動作太慢，許多人已經站起來了，他的話已經開始，又不好啞然而止，只好說下去，但人們巳紛紛離座向外走了，就在這且散且講的情況下，黃先生的談話，在聽不清楚中結束。</p>
<p>散會了，主人們又站在門口向大家握手送別，最後走出來的一位是黃炎培。（廿一日）</p>

<p>蚌埠是記者的第二故鄉。職前，在這具有北方兼江南風光的都市里，整整地住過十多年，直到二十七年二月初淪陷的前夕，始泣別了這可愛的第二故鄉。勝利的凱簡，播送着令人興奮的捷音，記者帶着欣悅的心情，終於由陪都回到這淮上的重鎮。</p>
<p>蚌山別來無恙</p>
<p>別來無恙，景色如昔，縱橫在市區內的幾條馬路，依然是崎嶇不平，兩側高高矮矮的樓廈，八年來也沒有什麽大變化。屹立市區南邊的蚌山，仍是亭亭錯落，花木扶疏，點綴在這明媚的春光裏。不過山麓東西，添築了不少從前供敵僞住用的屋宇。蚌山是經過七年多血腥的統治，日寇雖是力竭投降，山河重光，但是這裏的汚痕穢跡，即令倒灌長淮的水，也是洗濯不淨的。</p>
<p>中山公園觀光</p>
<p>蚌山屹立在中山公園內，是市區民遊覽的唯一風景區。記者昨天在宿雨乍晴的傍晚，趁着斜陽一抹，作由渝返蚌後的實效遊覽。山南麓的抗日陣亡烈士公墓，是徐庭瑤將軍煞費神思而建築的，現在墓宇猶在，惟多年失修，巳漸損舊。山的東麓，北伐名將馬文伯軍長的銅像，早發展迅速杳無蹤影。據聞是被敵拆毀運走的，墓巳移至北麓，有汪逆兆銘題而籌刻的石碑，巍立墓前，此一汚玷，希望能及早撤除。此外如撥雲　三民池剿匪紀念塔等，仍舊存在，惟山嶺的火吶鎮亭，巳改舊觀，有戌軍在此值崗，禁止遊人接近。</p>
<p>淮河蜿蜒似蛇</p>
<p>淮河好似蜿蜒着的一條大長蛇，自上年黃河　淮，倒灌上游後，河水呈着橙黃的顔色，彷彿經過無數黃沙染着的一般，錯落在河北的小蚌埠，仍是不脫村鎮模樣。河南岸的新舊兩船塘，經多年淤積沈澱，完全變成泥沙，巳失停泊船隻的效用。附近添築了不少的草棚。最近總說當局有在鐵路東葉　子後面新開東船塘的計劃，已經數度勘測，何時興工，尚不知道。</p>
<p>淮濱晚景入畫</p>
<p>縱臥在淮上的大鐵橋，仍保持着雄偉的姿態。浦徐間的火車，每天是日夜好幾次在上面轟轟隆隆地奔馳着。回憶二十七所蚌埠淪陷的前晚，曾經國軍用炸藥破壞過，但不久就被敵人修好，恢復通車。情景如昨，但在這七年多歲月裏，蚌埠不知演了多少可歌可泣的慘劇，同時也不知造了多少可恨可恥的醜聞。</p>
<p>淮濱晚眺，帆橋如林，沙鷗飛掠過水面，人在殘陽暮烟裏，真是富有詩意的一幅自然圖畫。</p>
<p>北里弦歌喧鬧</p>
<p>華昌街一帶，二馬路一大旅社巷內，是從前着名的銷魂窟，貴人文士，巨商大賈，與夫政客武人，不知在此留了多少的鑒跡趣事，八年抗戰洪流，冲刷之下，迄今猶未冲刷淨這些汚穢。</p>
<p>這些北里之花，大都是江都熙城産，燙發，塗粉，抹口紅，着高跟，個個都是入時的妝飾，較之滬上，毫無二臻。每夕華燈初上，車水馬龍，燕燕鶯鶯，像花枝招展，必在街頭亂飛，有的出局應差，嬌啼佯嗔，淫歌浪呌，固然令人厭惡，而長紅依翠，揮金如土者，仍不乏其人。地方治安當局，且照例徵收花捐，據聞每名月繳捐款五千元，統計現在蚌埠操淫業的妓女，有三百餘名之多。每夕風光旖旎，管弦如沸，個中情景，可以想見。</p>
<p>在一陣午風聚過之後，飛來了沿戶乞討的慘音，和上述的情況相比，適成兩個苦業不同的對照。（三月廿一日）</p>

<p>日人在豫北，做了三大工程，這三大工程都沒有完成。一個工程是在濟源東南，修築十方里的溝渠，這工程只完成三分之一。如果這個工程全部完成，那濟源十方里的周圍，幹地變成水田，麥苗改成稻苗，綠水長在，青禾永生，那末北方雄偉的天色，就兼有南國憂美的風土了。其次一個工程，就是引沁入運。由沁縣到博愛的張村的一道河溝已經掘通，所差的是五個水閘沒有開工。敵人是想改良沁縣，博愛兩縣土壤，種植稻苗；同時使得河運，增加交通力量。另外一個工程，是相當的偉大，就是由武陟到新鄉東北的一百一十里長，掘成一條河道，那是卅二年冬開工，敵人曾經去年放過水，據說很不差。那一工程，還有十分之八未成，全部完成，當有五六千頃的田受惠。敵人不僅是做小恩小惠的事，有時似乎也有大恩大惠之舉。篆這些工程，可算是大恩大惠之舉。然而敵人的目的：第一是在收買眼前的人心，如像在黃汎區修堤一樣，故意做給老百姓看看；但其最終的目的，還是要向我們的老百姓作進一步的剝削。敵人開發豫北就是敵人加深剝削豫北，地多掘一尺，水多放一寸，老百姓就是要多流一尺一寸血汗。好在現在是光復了，這些工程，都已落在我們手裏，我們未完成這些工程，把大恩大惠　的賜給我們的老百姓！</p>
<p>團體人民引頸北望</p>
<p>在鄉州，有好些北上的機關，團體，以及人民逗留着。看到那些機關，團體，人民遙望北國，如呆如癡，感嘅萬分。到了新鄉，逗留的機關，團體，人民比鄭州還多，他們還是碰着釘子回來的，不像逗留鄭州的是看到「此路不通」的牌子而停足的。到了安陽，逗留的機關，團體，人民又比新鄉還多，他們不僅碰着釘子倒回的，而且是出死入生地過來的。</p>
<p>在安陽，不知有多少專員辦事處，多少特派員辦事處，更不知有多少流亡縣政府。只是冀南幾縣的黨政工作人員，流亡在安陽有一千多人。他們如今衣食爲難，飄流無定，惡運落在他們的身上。</p>
<p>我拉着幾個冀南黨政工作人員來問：「怎麽一回事？在冀南。」據他們說：冀南鬥爭的激烈，國民黨員犧牲之大，雖以蓋述，臨城書記長吳特，壯烈犧牲；磁縣縣長李貞元，書記長王紹曾同時殉難，死亡同志二百餘人；肥鄉書記長楊瀟亭，廣平書記長鄭幹卿協同固守肥鄉城堅持七十四天。現在刑合附近有十四縣團隊，由黨務督導員任曉民，郭書棠，劉書援，及刑台書記長于化　領導，在破碎的河山中，高舉着青白大義。雞澤書記長盧子和，現在在邯鄲獨立支撐着局面。其他南和縣，柏鄉，臨洛關，成安，永年，峭河，都有忠勇的賞在固守着崗位，臨洛關的許鍾奇同志，勇敢過人，一身是胆，所以有人稱之爲許鐵頭。</p>
<p>生者潦倒死者含冤</p>
<p>在晦籖的局面下，一些人悲慘的奮鬥，壯烈的犧牲，很少人會知道的。他們是很不幸，生者潦倒，死者幽幽。過去在洛陽，看到一些流亡省政府，心中異常悽然。這次在安陽，遇到那些忠勇奮鬥的志士，那種悽然的情結又浮起來，而日覺得更難堪。我只希望中國歷史迅即轉入新貞，免得再發生這一類不幸的悲劇。（三.十三。冀州）</p>
<h3 id="c85">「寶島」真面目獲初步接觸　台灣危機待克服 <a href="#c85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— 本報十六日航訊　暮時寄自台北</p>
<p>來自南榕</p>
<p>在海拔二千八百尺的福州鼓山之顛，我們可以遠眺浮沈在海面上的台灣，這裏隔着一個惡浪的海峽，航程是一四四浬，短短的距離，要是在陸上的話，只需兩三天的徒步旅行，也可以到達了，可是我們却費時整整的一個月安抵目的地。</p>
<p>原告我們估計福州經常有航輪開台灣的，所以搭着二天三夜海行的航輪到了福州，不幸的消息是開赴台灣的機帆被征用去了，帆船太冒險，而中航公司約定期班，迄未實行，團體廿餘人的話，可以請求一架，但票價是要從上海算起的，這可給我們精神上莫大的打擊。我們只有唯一的信念是：等，等船。</p>
<p>向招商局探詢，回答是到台灣雲的登記者巳有二千多人，船可望在月底有，可是能否擠得進前兩批頗成問題，幸運的經人幹旋，我們終於買到了三月十日開航的票。機帆船是受台省交通處管理的，約九十六噸，是一隻接收下來的木壳漁船，不過裝有柴油引擎而巳，俗語是綳綳船，船夫全部是日本的俘虜，因爲他們每月僅有月薪兩百元，使他們勾結了若干關係者，營着走私和搭客的勾當照規定，這船可以搭八〇人，臨時增添了四十人，結果却滿載了兩百多旅客。這批人，不是赴台的公務人員，而是經常往返的單幫客，船長和福州招商局都歡迎他們，因爲規定的票價一萬二千元，可以私費到五萬八萬元，這是驚人的數額。可是這却增添了行旅者莫大的痛苦，和生命危殆的恐懼。</p>
<p>主要的難受，不只是載重，人擠得像死豬，沒有水喝，而是船行的無定期。風向不對不開，天氣惡劣不開，老大生病不開，旅客沒權過問，招商局置之不理，所有權全部握在戰俘的手裏。對字處理不良，營私舞弊，令人痛恨，對中國舴天才的缺乏，又不能不說可憐。</p>
<p>決定十日開的船，六日政工告別了閩江，經過四天四夜，幸運的到了台灣。基隆海峽的風浪，不是南北洋面所能遇到的，船夫老是注視着惡浪的流冲，怕的是船頭　進浪濤裏雲。船的傾斜度常在三十八度左右，再加兩度，生命就要葬送了，待踏上基隆的埠頭時，疲倦得將死的旅客，相互面觀着互慶更生！</p>
<p>艱苦的海程，從上海到台灣費了一個月，飲受險驚，當記者執筆寫這篇通訊時，中心猶有餘悸！</p>
<p>基隆雨景</p>
<p>在浪濤洶湧的藍色的海上，遠望基隆，是可望而不可接的。等船駛進了港口，回頭一看，正不知船是從那一個方向開進來的！這個軍港的優勢，不祇　因爲數吉噸的航輪，呆以直靠碼頭，而是四面都是高山，山上都有樹林，翠綠的和藍色的海浪，相映成趣。</p>
<p>台灣屬於常濕溫和區域，氣候海洋性很濃，我們登陸時，在福州穿着的衣衫並不嫌熱，只是迷糊的山，港和街道口，老一陣陣的飄着毛毛雨，我們在雨中漫遊全市，開始接觸寶島的真面目　我們住在旅社所改的市府招待所裏，這裏與車站爲鄰，推開窗，可以看得出基隆港的輪廓，打着傘，穿着長統靴在街上漫步，泥濘的有一點江南黃霉天的感覺，燠熱，但又不是挺爽怏的，毛雨在洒，人們是在雨中渡過漫長的月日。</p>
<p>街道是遼闊的柏油頭，人們拖着木屐穿着百結的布衣爲生活奔波着。這裏沒有較大規模的店鋪，有的只是用木板搭起來的棚戶，他們開設着吃食店，零賣店，這情景像是遭了大火災後的流民。是的，全基隆市中心區沒有一幢可以安居的房子，有的統被炸毀了，街上滿是三和土和磚石的小堆，郵政局大樓像是保持它過往雄偉的風姿，但巳披上了成千百的彈痕，沿埠頭的運輸站和車站，燒灭彈的威力，迫使它剩了一副破碎的骨骼，港內炸沈和擊沈的船隻，更露出了它的殘體，人們都在廢墟堆里找尋生機，用簡陋的方式搭建炸後的新居。在廢墟景象的另一面，我們又看到成千留待遣歸的日僑，男女們的狼狽面孔和孩子們的窘態，使人們在痛恨侵略主義者的情結之外，頓生起針限的同情，深信這是人類的同情心吧！</p>
<p>走過一家香蕉鋪，以台幣六元四角買了一斤，店江告訴着，現在統統漲了，以前香蕉只是三分一斤，橘子以前是一元二角，如今是十二元一斤，主要是米，一斤竟漲到十八元五角，這種空前的生活指數，民衆非但不能獲得勝利的安慰，相反的却給予他們最大的厄難，他們開始過着以山芋和什糧充饑的日子。</p>
<p>在車站，看到了接管的站長，他很希望和我們談談，他說：「我來了四個月，第二批到如今沒來，真寂寞啊」！寂寞的雨中的基隆，不知何時，可以雨過天晴，讓人們享受一點勝利的幸福？</p>
<p>台北漫步</p>
<p>從基隆到台北，過去火車的班次是很多的，像電車一樣；現在却大不同了，班次少，且常誤點，據說因爲車頭少，調度困難，我們以五元五角台幣的票價，自基隆出發到台北，當時一句話。</p>
<p>短短的距離後，穿過了三個山洞，和汽車綫平等着在山巒裏蜿蜒前進。四周的山嶺叢生着茶樹，在椰子林下我們可以嗅着香蕉和桂花香味；在平野里，古老的純中國式的耕耘法，還在電氣化工業化的海島上出現，農夫用牛耕田，像浙東的水車捲着泉水灌溉着新插的秧田，人們重又回復到承平時的正常的和平的生活。</p>
<p>台北站和基隆一樣，曾受過炸彈的洗禮，因爲時間巳五點，人們都從都市里向返到郊外去，車站上縱擠䙽人羣，我們從站上走到目的地躭下了。</p>
<p>台北，是全台的心臟，日本人時代，總督府和州政府所在地，戰時此地也被炸得改變了面目。總督府，高等法院和隣近高大的洋樓，統被炸毀，數十年的榕樹，離開了原有的根另生新枝，在瓦礫塲裏，人們還像追憶着被炸時的恐怖和被炸前日本人的作威。州政府安然無恙，現在作爲建設新台灣的樞紐！長宮公署。</p>
<p>高度的工業化，和日本人的慘淡經營，使台島成了純日本式的現代花都。它原有的性格，不但在都市的外貌上看不到，即是台灣人的本質似乎也正與祖國的傳統脫了節，雖然我們到處於以前所用的日語，現在巳改爲閩南話，穿旗袍的女人也多起來了。</p>
<p>過個區域里的教育水凖很高，孩子們受的強迫國民教育，有數百個學校單位，可是如今大部停頓了，原因是校舍駐了兵，沒辦法復課。</p>
<p>台北熱鬧的太平町，滿是擺舊貨攤的，情形和上海虬江路一樣，都是日本人賣出的東西，有許多夫妻倆一同　，更有叫男女小孩賣，爲的是多備一些錢，回到被征服的故國去。</p>
<p>拆屋偷賣</p>
<p>台省人民現在正在五十一年來從未有的苦悶裏。在勝利時懷抱着過高的熱望，但現在他們是失望了，由失望而沈入悲觀的深淵里，主要的是生活高漲，逐漸失去民心，更影響了治安，而一部份接收人員的濫用職權也給民衆以不良的印象，一般智識育年，因爲政府的不能任用，造成了若干嚴重的失業恐慌，即蟬聯的，目睹政治，不能迅速上軌道，也漸漸表示了消極的反抗，我們不能不指出：這是目前台省的危機。</p>
<p>我們　　　　　　　　後的一個時期，因爲日本人的恐慌，給予台人以動亂的機會，中央政府來了，若干不法台人竟勾結了若干腐化的工作人員，擾亂治安，貪臟枉法，舉一個例，日本僑民遣數回國，僑民的財産，政府接收到的，只是無法移動的不動産，可以移動的早搬走了，最近竟連房屋也要偷了拆賣，這情景，人們說是和上海五十步與百步之比，實令人慨歎！</p>
<p>政府治台，當然有既定的國策，但以台人治台爲施政的最後準則，是值得擁擠的。到台省去的工作人員，應深自警惕，更努力保存台省的元氣，絕不能抱歪曲的征服者的心念。</p>
<p>台弱的「政經報」謂：以一個輕工業化的落後的國家，管理重工業化的台灣，是困難的，我們但希望能做到不要前進，維持現狀的境地，可是單是維持，又是多麽令人難於相信做到的事啊！</p>
<h3 id="c86">英國人所關懷的新中國　對中國問題缺乏充分理解　利害關係上流露嫉美心理 <a href="#c86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— 本報十四日航訊　倫敦特約記者雪岩寄</p>
<p>一個初從中國來的人，英國朋友，見了面總愛問：「中國現在怎樣？中國人對英國的印象怎樣？」被問的人，不免感覺這樣質泛的題目，有點難於作答。迨在英國住了若干時日，國內朋友來信，也往往好帶上一句：「英國人現在對中國的印象怎樣？」也同樣迷惘，令人難於作答。厲兩國人民，彼此關切，是自然的趨勢，但相互間的了解，就嫌不夠，也是事實。</p>
<p>一彎手指　可指出關懷理由</p>
<p>英國人中國，是不用講的。隨便一彎手指，就可以舉上十餘條理由。譬如說中英是這次戰爭中的戰友呀，英國是西洋各國中最先與中國有糾葛的國家呀，英國在戰前是歐洲諸國中與中國貿易關係最多的國家呀…等，那都不去提了。單說香港，印度與緬甸里英國人當然認爲是大英帝國的一部分，這些土地，都與中國毗連，都與中國有特殊關係，所以英國人看來，英國簡直是中國的毗鄰。尤其香港，我們縱歷史和種族的觀點着眼，知道香港是中國人的世界。英國從行政系統着眼，認爲香港仍是英國的一部分。從這一點因謀中，就變生許多連帶關係。中國人在倫敦地下車中往來，沈澱會有人來拍你肩膀，問起，「朋友，你可以讓我知道來自中國的一部分嗎？」假使你說上海，他的回答，厲是：「好地方，我在一九××年去過…」，接着可以　談好多時，有進還打聽他在中國的朋友近況之數。同樣的情形，也可以飯館或旅館中碰到，英領到達中國的可真不少，原因當然是以前的駐軍，及軍艦商船　等往來的機會太多。也許正爲如此。英國人很多感覺自己和中國關係甚深，祇　因這幾年戰爭才隔遠了。在這幾年中，自然聽到過不秒關於中國消息，但因消息，本身常互相矛盾，一般就很難道真相，碰見了中國人，喜歡打聽打聽，也是常理。</p>
<p>全篇報道　立塲常不甚公正</p>
<p>英國今日非常關心中國，是不成問題的，是相當普遍的現象。但關心之點，却因人而異。有許多地方，是我們在國內的人，所不容易想到的。今日英國報紙上刊載中國的消息，並不算多，國內最重要的問題，英國報紙，大多提到了。英國廣播公司，也常常有中國消息。譬如國內的政治協商會，停戰協定，改編軍隊及最近的東北問題，要點都經報道了。關心中國情形的人，也可以勉強知道一個眉目。但最可惜的，英國記者，在報道中國事件的語　時，有許多懷着舊時觀念的，隨便不負責任的插進一二句去，使全篇報道，失却公正客觀的立塲。譬如曼微勞動保護特衛報最近於報導中法協定成立，國軍將以越南北部轉交法軍時，報記者於言及公報中未提及撤退確實日期時，忽然加上一句充滿武斷氣氛的解釋，說「這或許是中國政府對當地駐軍是否能遵守命令沒有把握的緣故」。又如法國軍艦砲轟海防時，各報標題，大多作「華軍砲擊法軍艦」，或「法軍艦被砲擊」之類，與內容不合一。而於我國中央社所發消息，謂法軍艦首先開火一說，則加上引號，表示懷疑之意。但較左傾的幾家報紙，也有不如此作題，而僅述事實，不暗示左右袒的。大致說來，英國新聞記者對中國的態度，似乎還沒有一般人民開明。</p>
<p>英情報部　擬聘留學生撰稿</p>
<p>在我們中國人看來，英國報界，似對中國還不夠，反之，英國希望國人能對他多了解，却很殷切。英國廣播公司，每天有國語及廣東語的中文廣播，對象當然是中國人，希望藉此可使中國人對於英國多認識一點。同時英國情報部，近來想聘幾位中國留學生，幫他們撰述英國方面的消息，用電報打至英使館中的新聞專員處，供給各報，以便採用。因爲用中國學生挑選英國材料，自然了解中國人的心理多一些，在中國博得同意的機會也多一些。最近在每日電訊報的一篇中國通訊中，很責備英國宣傳界方法的錯誤，他說英國在作戰期間，有多少貢獻犧牲，在中國都沒有深刻的印象，但英國國內生活的艱苦，和英國必須向美國舉債等消息，則中國報紙登載的很多，以致在中國人的印象中，英國祇　是一個貧窮的國家罷了。曼徹斯特衛報最近在一篇昆明通訊中，也指出在中國的開着車新聞處雖經一度結束，但經過改組後，又在大量發新聞稿了。渴望了解世界情形的中國人，都讀到美國所供給的消息，所以對美國印象甚深。因此，這位記者主張英國也應該效法。</p>
<p>座談會上　暴露嫉美態度</p>
<p>很奇怪的，英國在一般外交政策方面，雖認定需要與英國合作。但在利害關連之處，即和開着車競爭與妒嫉之烈，遽非國內所能想象。今日很多英國人，想到遠東，便不免同時連想到勁敵美國，情不自禁的表現出憤慨之狀。所以提到中國，也不免提心吊胆的打擊美國在中國的作爲。記者初至英國時，因偶然機會，去參加一次中國運動委員會（China　Campaign）所主辦的座談會。當夜主辦的人是一位工黨委員，名賈拉翰（Collag　Iiam）他曾到過前綫，對中國問題，相當有研究。當晚分析國共問題，很多精到之處，後來講到美國對中國政府及共黨的態度時，對於美國攻擊非常猛烈。其他到會的人，也有同樣表示，態度都很沉痛這位議員，後來因反對政府向美貸款所答允的條件，憤而辭職了。記者當時因初到倫敦，雖然從他們的議論中，不難推知出於嫉妬之心。但爲了中國的事情，嫉妬之深，一至於此，未免使記者驚異。後來與英國人相處漸久，便知此種嫉妬心理，相當普遍。去年藉庚款及英國獎學金到英國來留學的學生，約百餘人，其中有一部分進工廠實習，據說有不少正廠的老闆和經理之類，直接問起他們將來回國後購買材料，喜歡英國貨呢？還是喜歡美國貨？</p>
<p>赴美留學　英表示反對情結</p>
<p>再如中國現在攷選留學生的課門，都是根據中國需要而定的，理論上當然很正確。但是在送到這國家去之先，也沒有仔細打聽一下，這國家的學校裏有沒有這一門功課。近年來，中國遣送出洋的學生，大都是演習應用科學的，而應用科學在很多國家，並不承認其爲高深學問，不列入研究院內。英國就是如此，所以很多來英進研究院研究他所專長的一門應用科學時，發現錯了門路，有的因此到處亂闖，不得其所，有的便改了行，也有的不願改行，想上美國學校的，却遭遇反對。英國獎賞金是不用請了，就是庚款的學生，聽說英國董事也多反對，不能遂願。歷屆英庚款學生中，都有想改赴美國求學的，都未成功。祇有第六屆，適當英國遭空襲甚烈，學生都不能安心演習，才送到加拿大的，但也不許到美國去。</p>
<p>不平氣雰　今後或稍可平息</p>
<p>談到英國人嫉妬美國的心情，我想隨便提到一件很有趣的外交上的事件。英蘇在伊朗發生利害冲突，本來在帝俄時代已經如此。後來因俄國革命，無力向外發。後來因狐國革命，無力向餐發展，才有短期的寗靜。這次作戰後，蘇軍勝利，乘機便又欲尋帝俄進所尋求的「各外發展」了。其結果，英蘇又在伊朗互爭雄長，亦爲當然之事。迨去年年底，因伊朗北部要求自主，形勢相當惡化。恰好美國這時提議開莫斯科三外長傳言。英國欣然參加，滿望伊朗問題能在三外長傳言中，求得一個妥協辦法。但在傳言中，據說蘇聯對美國雖無表示讓步，但對英國却始終強硬，臻使英國原來的希望，絲毫不能實現。一時英國報紙，講到伊朗問題，總和東九省的蘇軍並論，語調相當沉痛。在英國看來，東九省該是美蘇冲突的地點，所以蘇軍在東九省行動，不顧條約的程度，惟稍遜於在伊朗，英國便認爲是蘇聯對英美之間有所軒烥的語氣。當伊朗以此案提出於聯合國安全理事會，而蘇聯與烏克蘭亦提出要求英軍撤退希臘與荷印爲對案時，英國報紙，很敏銳的感到蘇聯沒有同時要求美軍退出中國，足見蘇聯對美國比較多所顧忌。這種態度，在英國報紙上常可以看到。好了，最近蘇軍在東九省也有了問題，而美國對伊朗北部蘇軍延不撤退，亦巳提出強硬抗議，英國的憤憤不平之氣，今後當可稍稍平息了。</p>

<h3 id="c87">希望於生產界 <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— 漢</p>
<p>記得，當政府西遷陪都以後，一切實業的重心也就隨着轉移到川黔一帶。那時，因爲時局的動　，以及國際路綫的封鎖的結果，一切東西便呈現着「早晚市價不同」的漲，尤其是當勝利快要來臨的一段時間中，物價一漲便是幾倍！那個時候，生產的廠家的確遭遇着嚴重的威脅，由於物價的不安定，產品脫售後，便掉不回所需的原料，因此收支懸殊，損失浩巨！一部分廠家仍是堅貞的，苦力支撑着，但是大部分工廠，原料照樣購進，都不開工，它的出品還是原封不動的原料，它們已退出了生產界的崗位，幹着投機囤積的勾當！於是產品大减，投機者增加，物價推波助瀾，民生疾苦也就日益加深。</p>
<p>現在，收復區的物價波動情形，與戰時毫無二致；危機的存在，確屬嚴重。此種惡劣的環境的刺激，很足以阻碍生產業之發展，現有的生產界應有高度的警覺性，在物價極度的波動中，謀求生產的發展，生產的改進，進而平穩物價！爲了挽救民生榮枯大局，就許是犧牲一部分利益，也該嚴守崗位，對整個問題作積極性的解決，負起生產界應盡的責任，然後我們方足以談如何工業化。</p>
<h3 id="c88">生產第一 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>英國效能雜誌，曾發表意見，以爲國家的組成，是工業商業和農業，因此政治實在佔據極小的部份，政府的收入，也以稅收爲重要的部門，所以報紙上登載的新聞，也應以工商業及農業等的建設爲多。</p>
<p>這一種意見，是在幾年之前發表的，但到了目前的中國情形，更爲切合。所以，「生產第一」可以說是目前最合時代的口號。</p>
<h3 id="c89">亟待解決的製綫原料 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— 羅立羣</p>
<p>無論那一種工業製品，對於原料的選擇，是決定出品優劣的重要因素。在工業先進各國，很多工廠的主要原料，是自給的，因爲不但可以减輕成本，而且可以得到配合製品所需要的品質。</p>
<p>以製綫業而論，從前曾經風行我國的練條牌木紗，因爲主要原料的棉紗是特紡的，所以對於纖維的匀度，拉力，都配合製綫的標準。</p>
<p>我國製綫工業發展的歷史不久，設備還未健全，原料的取給，向賴紗廠供應，在戰前紗廠方面有爲製綫特紡的棉紗，而現在一般紗廠方面，有爲製綫特紡的棉紗，而現在一般紗廠所紡的產品，大多爲布廠及其他織品所需要，雖然也有爲製綫可用的，但是拉力匀度，却不合標準，以致製綫業對於原料的選擇，發生相當的困難。</p>
<p>現際海禁解放，外貨乘機而來，若不急將原料問題解決，如何與之競爭？我國製綫工業的發展前途，勢將步入重大危機，要解決這個問題，除了製綫業本身努力設法解決原料的自給外，同時希望紗廠業能就製綫業原料需要的條件，以及生產的用量，專門紡製在市上供應，請不要忽視製綫業在生產建設上重要性，來互相合作。</p>
<p>雖然在目下製綫原料尙未獲得解決困難之時，但是飛綸製綫廠對於原料選擇，絕不因困難而遷就，所採用原料是向某紗廠訂的特紡，所以在品質方面更較前改進，而一方面則積極配置紡製設備，冀能在製品上達到理想的標準。</p>
<h3 id="c90">手帕織造廠原料問題之嚴重性　希望於中國紡織建設公司 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— 姚思偉</p>
<p>自抗戰勝利以後，全國上下，一致高呼着「生產建設」，但是因爲原料的缺乏，以致這一個口號，到現在還不能够正式的實現。而我們手帕織造一業，更患着這樣的嚴重問題。</p>
<p>査我們手帕織造業，在上海一地，共有一百餘家，全部織機，約有二千台以上，若完全開工，可日產一萬餘打，所用原料，需棉紗十餘件，計分六十支單紗十分之八·九，八十四支雙股和三股及一百支雙股一百二十支雙股十分之一·二。雖八十四支以上的棉紗，祗少數廠家需用，如寰球廠等等，而這問題嚴重性的產生，就在這六十支以上的棉紗上。</p>
<p>我國的國策，雖則是以農立國，但是所有的產品，泰半較歐美爲劣，尤其是主要的農產品「棉花」的生產，在經過這次長期的戰爭，一年一年的在减少，且所有的產品，祗能紡二十支四十支等的粗紗，若六十支以上的細紗，則非用外國棉花不可。</p>
<p>上海在敵偽佔領時期，根據海關進出口統計月報的統計，於民國二十九年度，一月至六月出口的手帕，計二十一萬三千七百二十四打，而至三十年度一月至六月，已增至三十二萬五千五百八十四打，完全銷售與香港，新加坡，荷屬東印度菲列賓等地。近年來因爲戰事的關係，運輸阻滯，雖吿停頓，然自抗戰勝利以後，南洋各地，已有陸續定貨，若今後海運暢通，銷數一定可觀，藉可增國外資金之輸入，於生產建設，當亦有助。</p>
<p>手帕廠同業，因鑒於原料問題，日益嚴重，而市上祇存極少數之六十支單紗，較六十支雙股，售價竟高至將近一倍，此緣於供求關係，以致一般商人之投機抬高。奈本業所用，完全單紗，以致成本加重，常然生產亦受打擊。</p>
<p>經大會議決通過，請求中國紡織建設公司，設法供應原料，當推派代表及筆者等，前往該公司，面陳問題之嚴重性，若一旦原料繼絕，則數千工人，立致失業，而且影響社會。蒙該公司副經理吳味經先生曁業務處長蔣仙旅先生等，允予設法源源供應。</p>
<p>承中國紡織建設公司的盛意，將從來未曾開出的六十支單紡，於本月二十一日，掛牌出售了，每件的售價是四百二十五萬元。但是，我們爲了價格的過高，而發生疑問，因爲同樣的六十支雙股僅須二百五十萬元，其相差之數，與一般市上相同。我們的手帕同業，若以如此高價之原料，則成本加重，對於產銷，更受影響，所以不得不再派代表及筆者等，前往中國紡織建設公司接洽，當蒙萬作琛先生代爲延見，經陳訊問售價相差之原由，據答亦因「供求關係」，若以合理來講，六十支單紗的價格，應該較六十支雙股略高，因爲在紡紗時之手續，雙股較單紗爲繁。</p>
<p>中國紡織建設公司爲我國唯一之國營商業機構，當然旨在扶助工商，發展生產，凡一舉一動，足以影響全國商業。希望該公司當局，以公平合理的價格，來戢平投機取巧之劣風。若亦因「供求關係」而跟着市價，同樣的上漲，我想似乎與創辦時之初衷，有些背道吧。</p>

<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>（二）三大部門的聯繫</p>
<p>生產，銷售和經濟調度，旣然是一般工商業的三個重要部門，要使事業有穩固的基礎和迅速的發展，三個部門，非平均發展不可。同時除了平均發展之外，更需要有密切的聯繫。這可以作一個比較明顯的譬喩，就是我們經營一種事業，等於是在耕田，生產等於是下種，銷售等於是收穫，而經濟調度等於是天時的配合。努力下種，收穫自然豐厚，同時爲了要有豐厚的收穫，我們自然非努力下種不可，但除了這兩方面的努力之外，我們還要求一年四季，風調雨順，那末滋長繁榮，可以達到預期的目的。如果天不凑巧，這一個月來長時期的大雨，下一個月來一個長時期的旱天，需要雨水的時候，雨水不來，不需要雨水的時候，却來了盆大雨，那末農作物就要受傾到極大的損害。在事業的經營上，購買原料，出售貨品，日常工資，沒有一件事可以和經濟脫離關係。如果經濟調度不得其方，那末需要購買原料的時候，無力購買，等到有力購買的時候，代價已經高昂，在不需要銷售的時候，因爲需款孔亟不得不忍痛犧牲，等到貨品出售，市價剛巧上漲，以致補進原料的數量因而减少，可見經濟調度得法，就可以得心應手，左右逢源，不得其方，那末就是到處碰壁，步步失敗。所以經濟調度，實在可以說是事業成功的最大要點，即以個人而論，又何獨不然。韋氏大辭典以理財一字（即經濟調度）Finance定爲「處理財產致能獲利的科學」。事業的經營，旣然不能拋棄獲利，主管人員就不能不懂這一種科學。</p>
<p>同時生產與銷售兩者之間的聯繫，也很容易加以解釋，在貨品開始製造之前，生產部份，如需要銷售部份供給市面上一般情形的報告，使生產的貨品，能够攫取相當的市塲，銷售部份，也需要生產部份供給關於製造的一切情形，從而知道貨品優點的所在。銷售部份，發覽貨品的銷路，可以擴展，那末就可以要求生產部份，擴充生產；生產部份，如果預算原料可有辦法，產量可以增多，就可以要求銷售部分除了固有的銷路之外，再產生新的銷路來。這樣，彼此合作，銷售生產，都可以具有把握，再加以適當的經濟調度的方法，事業的成功，自然可以操左券。</p>
<p>過去在抗戰期間，因爲物資缺乏，幣値貶落，祗要囤積物資，就可以獲利，但這終究是戰時的現象。而且也不是正當經營事業的方式。勝利以後，要配合時代非要從三方面平均發展不可，因爲市場上的競爭，日趨劇烈，非有良好的銷售方法，不足以維持固有的營業，更不足以擴展未來的銷路。如果銷路不能擴展，成本永遠不能减低。在開始建設之初，原料不易購買，生產部份的工作，也相當費力，而資金的遝用，在目前一般廠商感到資本的不足的時候，更需要有良好的調度方法，使一塊錢可以產生二塊錢的效能。</p>
<p>在大的方面着想，我們要使整個工商界的輪子轉動起來；在小的方面講，我們要使每一個工商事業的輪子轉動起來；三個部門的密切聯繫，共同討論，可以說是轉動工商業輪子的原動力。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Investigation by Military Commission and Statistics Bureau Confirms Death of General Dai Li: Plane Crashed into Ma'anshan Mountain in Nanjing <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Ta Kung Pao] Regarding the news of the death of General Dai Li of the Military Commission's Investigation and Statistics Bureau in a plane crash, since this newspaper first revealed it on the 22nd, rumors have been rampant in the city, with no consensus. According to the results of investigations by this newspaper's reporters from various sources, it is confirmed that General Dai's plane, en route from Beiping via Qingdao to Shanghai on the 17th, crashed into the summit of Ma'anshan Mountain in Banqiao Town, southwest of Nanjing, resulting in his death. Dai's body was also identified in the burned wreckage of the plane and was placed in a coffin in Nanjing on the 22nd. The following is a comprehensive report from this newspaper's special correspondent in Nanjing and detailed information obtained from relevant sources in this city:</p>
<p>On the morning of the 17th, General Dai Li departed from Beiping on Aviation Commission plane number 222, bound for Shanghai. A telegram had been sent to the Shanghai Military Statistics Bureau office beforehand, stating that he would arrive in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 17th and planned to preside over the memorial week at the Shanghai office on the 18th. The plane was piloted by two American pilots. Also on board were seven staff members of the Military Statistics Bureau, including Xu Xuanfang, Director of Personnel, a deputy, two translators, and two guards. In addition, there were twenty-three officers and generals from our military organs.</p>
<p>The plane landed in Qingdao at noon to allow the passengers to have lunch. After continuing its flight, it sent out two telegrams. Later, due to a leaking fuel tank, radio communication was lost with the ground.</p>
<p>When the plane left Qingdao, the pilot mentioned that the weather report was very bad at the time. If they were unable to land in Shanghai, they planned to land in Nanjing. If they still could not land in Nanjing, they were prepared to return to Qingdao. Therefore, the amount of gasoline carried was very large, for use in hovering and flying around in various places in bad weather. The speed of the fire and its intensity after the plane crashed into the mountain summit were also likely due to the excessive amount of gasoline stored.</p>
<p>Flying Low to Choose a Location, Crash into Mountain Summit Ignites Gasoline</p>
<p>A few hours after the plane departed, it encountered strong winds and heavy rain. According to investigations, the plane circled near the suburbs of Shanghai in an attempt to land, but due to poor visibility on the airfield ground, it turned towards Nanjing, intending to land at Ming Palace Airport. However, while circling near Nanjing, dense fog made visibility poor, so it flew low to select a landing spot. Unexpectedly, it crashed into the mountain summit, and the gasoline inside the plane ignited, causing an unprecedented plane crash disaster in recent years. According to the investigation by this newspaper's special correspondent in Nanjing, there were three impact marks on the summit where the plane crashed. The plane's door was pressed against the ground after the crash. Judging from the situation, even if there were survivors among the passengers at the time, they were unable to open the door and escape in the brief moment before the gasoline exploded. According to nearby villagers, they heard miserable screams at the time, but they dared not approach to rescue them because of the exploding bullets inside the plane. After losing radio contact with the plane, personnel at the Shanghai and Nanjing airports immediately telegraphed the Aviation Commission to report the incident. Four special planes were dispatched on the afternoon of the 17th to search. The U.S. Air Force Command and our Air Force units ventured out despite the bad weather to conduct reconnaissance. On the 18th, eight more planes were dispatched to participate in the reconnaissance, but due to the dense fog and poor visibility, the burned wreckage of the plane was not discovered until the 19th on the slopes of Ma'anshan Mountain in Banqiao Town, southwest of Nanjing.</p>
<p>Shanghai Office Receives News, Personnel Rush to Investigate On-Site</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news, personnel from the Shanghai Military Statistics Bureau office rushed to Nanjing to conduct an on-site investigation. Li Chongshi, Chief of Staff of the Military Statistics Bureau, also personally led personnel to investigate. However, due to the intense fire, the bodies of the passengers were almost impossible to identify. However, the first items discovered were the personal seals of Xu Xuanfang, Director of Personnel of the Military Statistics Bureau, and a guard. Later, Dai's personal self-defense pistol and luggage key were also found, proving beyond a doubt that Dai was a passenger on the plane. Investigators also found gold teeth fillings resembling Dai's in the charred remains, further confirming that Dai was killed in the plane. Dai usually wore American-made wool sweaters. Investigators found a similar sweater on the back of one body, and based on this, they identified the corpse as Dai's remains. The skull of the corpse was fractured, and one hand was also destroyed. Among the remaining twenty passengers, only the bodies of Xu Xuanfang, Director of Personnel of the Military Statistics Bureau, two translators, one adjutant, and two soldiers were identifiable. The bodies of the remaining personnel were all burned. The Military Statistics Bureau recovered eight bodies and seven pistols from the crash site.</p>
<p>Placed in Coffin on the 22nd, Friends Deeply Mourn</p>
<p>After the unmistakable identification of Dai's body, it was moved to the Military Statistics Bureau office on Yixian Bridge, Zhongshan East Road, Nanjing, on the 22nd to be placed in a coffin. Silk floss was used to fill in the upper and lower parts to make a complete body, a ceremonial hat was placed on the head, and a silk quilt was placed over the body before it was placed in the coffin. Staff members from the Bureau's offices in Nanjing and Shanghai wept loudly at the time, and Dai's friends deeply mourned. After the news of General Dai's death reached Chongqing, it was reported that the authorities were discussing the selection of a successor.</p>
<p>General Dai, named Yu Chen, was fifty years old and a native of Jiangshan, Zhejiang. He was a graduate of Wenxi Elementary School, Hangzhou First Middle School, and the sixth class of the Whampoa Military Academy. In the 16th and 17th years of the Republic, he served as a staff officer under Hu Zongnan, stationed in Xuzhou, Jiangsu. In the 22nd year of the Republic, he succeeded Deng Weny in Nanchang as the Director of the Investigation Section of the Military Commission. Later, the section was reorganized into a bureau, and he was promoted to Director. His wife, née Mao, was also from Jiangshan and died of illness in Shanghai during the War of Resistance. He never remarried. His mother, née Lan, is seventy-one years old and still alive. Dai came from a prominent family with modest means. His son, Zangyi, is twenty-six years old and runs the Jianguo Middle School in Jiangshan. During the Xi'an Incident, Dai accompanied Madame Chiang Kai-shek and T.V. Soong to Xi'an. Dai was extremely strong-willed, with keen and insightful views, and acted with魄力. For more than ten years, he endured hardship and was very frugal.</p>
<h3 id="e2">National Army Penetrates Deep into Northeast Plains, Clearing Liaodong Peninsula, Red Star Newspaper Says Soviet Army is Accelerating Withdrawal <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Changchun on the 23rd] Today, six more planes transported another group of receiving personnel. Although rumors are rampant in the city, most people are quietly observing the changes, standing in the Mantetsu Building or walking the streets, feeling a new feeling, but certainly not an unpleasant one.</p>
<p>[United Press, Shenyang, 24th] The National Army Headquarters received news today that the New Sixth Army has reached Anshan, fifty miles south of Shenyang. Another unit of the National Army entered Liaoyang yesterday afternoon. They are waiting for reinforcements to arrive before continuing south. It is apparent that the 共军 in the area have retreated. It is rumored that a considerable number of 共正 are concentrated in the area, equipped with Japanese weapons. Furthermore, the National Army, starting from Xinmin, advanced in two routes, southeast and northeast, towards Panshan and Yingkou, which are occupied by the 共军. Once they occupy Yingkou, the National Army reinforcements can land at that port. Judging from the current situation, the National Army is currently making every effort to clear the entire Liaodong Peninsula. The situation in Changchun is still chaotic. According to fragmented news received in Shenyang, the Soviet army has withdrawn from the city without notifying the Chinese authorities beforehand. Telephone, telegraph, and railway traffic between Changchun and Shenyang remain blocked. The last two planes from Changchun yesterday carried forty high-ranking Chinese officials. Four hundred lower-ranking officials remain in the city.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 24th] According to news from Shenyang: The National Army entered Fushun on the 20th, assigning troops to be stationed there permanently. A unit of the 52nd Army is advancing near Liaoyang, and a unit of the New First Army entered Tieling on the 21st. After the Soviet army withdrew from Sipingjie, the 共军 took the opportunity to occupy it. There is currently intense fighting there.</p>
<p>[United Press, Shenyang, 22nd] (Delayed) The New First Army is still advancing on foot. The reporter, at a place more than twenty li outside the ancient city of Shenyang, watched these brave soldiers who had fought in the India-Burma theater, carrying automatic rifles and rifles, wearing U.S. military leather clothing, steel helmets, and high-heeled Arctic leather boots, marching in long columns on muddy and rutted roads. Cold and sudden raindrops hit their faces, indicating the arrival of spring in the Northeast. These soldiers, trained by Stilwell into a formidable force, are led by General Sun Liren, a graduate of the U.S. West Point Military Academy. They have just emerged from the malaria-infested tropical forests and arrived in the bitterly cold north. Now they are penetrating deep into the Northeast plains, heading towards Sipingjie, three hundred li away.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 24th] The number of Soviet troops here has significantly decreased. The withdrawal work in the last day or two seems to be slowing down, no longer as hurried as in the previous few days, and the atmosphere of uneasiness has also slightly eased. Some observers believe that the number of Soviet troops who have already withdrawn from Changchun may be greater than those who have not yet withdrawn. They believe that once the Soviet command issues the order for the final withdrawal, it can be completed in one or two days, or even within a few hours.</p>
<p>[French Press Agency, Moscow, 23rd] Officials recently announced that the Soviet army has not only withdrawn from Shenyang but also from neighboring areas, and the number of withdrawals has gradually increased.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 23rd] The Soviet army's official newspaper, "Red Star," reported today that the weather in Manchuria is warming up, and the Soviet army is accelerating its withdrawal. The reason the Soviet army initially failed to withdraw was due to two requests from the Chinese government, and later due to severe cold weather, which made marching difficult. The Soviet troops in Shenyang and Fushun have completely withdrawn.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Soviets No Longer Object to Using China Changchun Railway to Transport National Army <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 23rd] Regarding the transport of the National Army to Changchun for handover via railway, the Soviet side no longer objects and is currently discussing technical issues. When our military delegation formally presented a note to the Soviet side on this matter, the Soviet side, although expressing agreement in principle in its reply, concluded that it was "difficult to comply." After Liu Zhe, director of the China Changchun Railway, earnestly discussed the matter with Karger, the Soviet deputy director of the railway, Karger initially strongly opposed it, but soon expressed his agreement. Karger stated that there were not many vehicles on the railway and that it might be necessary to use some vehicles from the Beining Railway in the future. It is generally believed that there are no problems in principle or in theory with using the China Changchun Railway to transport the National Army. The so-called technical issues include the deployment of employees, the allocation of vehicles, and the repair of damaged sections of the railway. It is believed that if the Soviet side can provide us with some convenience in these areas, the process will be very smooth. Liu Zhe and Karger held their initial talks on the 21st. On the same day, they also sincerely exchanged views on the issue of selecting employees for the China Changchun Railway. As a result, they agreed that both parties would jointly issue employee identification cards to protect their safety. Liu, in his capacity as a member of the National Government and director of the China Changchun Railway, issued a notice to the Chinese and Soviet employees of the railway. The wording of the document had been agreed upon by Karger. The document stated: "My dearest Chinese and Soviet employees of the China Changchun Railway, as the Soviet troops withdraw and the Chinese troops take over, your ability to stand at your posts and fulfill your responsibilities is what I admire most." According to Liu, recently, the employees of the China Changchun Railway felt panicked due to the unsettled situation, but after reaching an agreement with the Soviet side on stabilization measures, the situation has stabilized. Liu also stated that, as of now, all employees of the board of directors are working as usual, except for two who left without resigning due to their relationship with the Economic Committee. Liu instructed the reporter to convey to the readers within the pass that the Chinese employees of the China Changchun Railway have "stood firm."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] The ratification instruments for the China-Mexico Friendship Treaty were exchanged at the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs on February 26 of this year. According to Article 10 of the treaty, it will take effect from the date of the exchange of ratification instruments.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Life of Traitorous Officials Imprisoned in Nanjing, Emperor Chen Died of Illness Last Week <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Nanjing, 24th] Chen Quan, the puppet Nanjing Gendarmerie Commander, who was arrested in Nanjing in the first batch of traitors last September 28, died of illness in prison last week. It is reported that Chen was addicted to opium in the past and repented incessantly before his death. After the news of Chen's death spread, Hu Yukun, who had served in the puppet army, and Li Ou, who had served in the puppet police, panicked greatly. They were relieved only after learning that Chen had died of illness. The imprisoned traitors are living their lives in prison in various ways. Li Shengwu spends his days searching for books and newspapers, drawing, and writing. Chen Junhui eats and sleeps all day, pretending to be calm. Lin Bosheng, whenever he has the opportunity, relapses into his old habits, bragging at will, but the guards ignore him. Pu Dong, also known as the Red Bean Hall Master, claims that he is a famous amateur opera singer in Beiping who has fallen into a Nanjing cesspool, a true "falling into a pit." With nothing to do in prison, he sings loudly, his enthusiasm still intact, but it is unknown when he will sing "Being Escorted."</p>
<h3 id="e6">Marshall Requests U.S. Loan to Aid China for Large-Scale Industrial Development, U.S. Department of Agriculture Proposes Recommendations for Reviving Our Agriculture <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[French Press Agency, New York, 23rd] Marshal George C. Marshall, President Truman's special envoy to China, today requested the U.S. National Advisory Council for an additional $560 million in loans to China. Regarding this matter, the Chinese government has already submitted a request for the Export-Import Bank to consider. Well-informed sources here believe that Marshal Marshall intends for the Chinese government to quickly obtain this loan to ensure political stability and to rely on it for large-scale industrial development. However, this issue seems to be better handled by the newly established Reconstruction Bank. The reason the Export-Import Bank has been slow to study the Chinese government's request is likely due to this.</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 23rd] The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Relations Office released a report on the 22nd, proposing several recommendations for reviving rural areas in China and Korea to compensate for the enormous losses suffered during the war against Japan. The report pointed out that about half of China's rural areas have been destroyed by war and suggested a broad agricultural expansion plan to meet China's specific needs. The report strongly urged assistance to Chinese farmers in adopting modern methods and improving general health and hygiene conditions.</p>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Boston, 23rd] According to a recent report in the Christian Science Monitor: Lu Guangmian, one of the leaders of the Chinese cooperative movement, and his wife have been visiting cooperative stores in New England for a week. Lu stated that he hopes to use the experiences he gained in the U.S. to expand cooperative enterprises after returning to China. He plans to visit England, Scotland, Denmark, Sweden, the United States, and other places on this world tour. The purpose of this trip is fourfold: (1) To discuss ways to exchange products with other countries that promote cooperative enterprises. (2) To exchange cooperative technologies in order to increase production and improve the quality of goods. (3) To promote the cooperative movement to assist ordinary people in improving their economic standing. (4) To communicate news about people and their public economic problems in various places in order to help maintain international peace.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Madame Chiang Arrives in Shanghai from Chongqing, Chen Bulei Accompanies Her for Short Rest <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Madame Chiang, accompanied by Central Committee member Chen Bulei and his wife, arrived at Longhua Airport at 4:10 PM yesterday on the special plane "Meiling." Also accompanying them was Ms. Kong Lingwei, the daughter of former Executive Yuan Vice President Kong Xiangxi. Central Committee member Chen Bulei has been suffering from fatigue and insomnia for the past two months, so he came to Shanghai for a short rest. Those who greeted them at Longhua Airport included Mayor Qian, Dong XianGuang, Huang Renlin, Chen Xunyu, Zhan Wenhu, Shi Yonggeng, and dozens of relatives and friends. At 4:00 PM, the 210 "Minjiang" plane carrying Madame's entourage landed at the airport first. At 4:10 PM, "Meiling No. 1" slowly landed. Madame Chiang, full of energy, stepped off the plane first with a smile, nodding to each of the greeters. Chen Bulei and his wife followed suit. Chen looked thinner than a few years ago, a testament to his hard work for the country over the past eight years. When reporters asked about his feelings on this trip to Shanghai, Chen replied: "I have lived in Shanghai the longest, and Shanghai is no different from my second hometown to me. It has been a full nine years since I left Shanghai in March of the 26th year of the Republic. This trip to Shanghai is like a traveler returning home. I am very grateful for the friendly struggle of Shanghai during the difficult times of the War of Resistance." Chen also said that he plans to visit Hangzhou in the near future to adjust to the tense life of the past years. After getting off the plane, Chen and his wife returned to their residence with his younger brother, Chen Liannian. After getting off the plane, Madame Chiang returned to her residence on Garth Road with Dong Xianguang and Ms. Kong Lingwei. Mayor Qian also went by car to pay his respects, leaving with Dong after a few minutes. After resting for a while, Madame Chiang visited Kong Xiangxi, who had arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. It is reported that Madame's purpose in coming to Shanghai this time, in addition to visiting Endner, may be to go to Nanjing to arrange matters for returning to the capital.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report, Guangzhou, 23rd] Madame Chiang will come here in the next few days, and Chairman Chiang plans to visit Guangdong in April.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Yesterday's People's Political Council Passed a Resolution Requesting the Government to Relieve the Food Shortage, Councilors Expose Corruption, Listeners Moved <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] The People's Political Council held its seventh meeting at 8:30 AM on the 24th. 144 councilors attended, with Jiangxi as chairman. Agriculture and Forestry Minister Zhou Yichun and Judicial Administration Minister Xie Guansheng gave reports on agriculture and forestry and judicial administration, respectively, completing them in two hours. More than 40 councilors, including Wang Guanying, proposed a motion requesting the government to quickly relieve the food shortage in various parts of the country, suggesting that the government adopt three relief measures, such as "exempting disaster-stricken provinces from purchasing military grain." It was passed by a vote. Subsequently, councilors raised written and oral questions regarding agriculture and forestry and judicial administration. One of the most heated questions regarding agriculture and forestry was about why Ling Xuan, an official of the ministry, committed suicide after being dismissed and the bribery and illegal sales of dairy cows and other malfeasance by Qian Tianhe, vice minister of the ministry, and his subordinate Zhang Binzhen during the takeover of enemy and puppet Shanghai farms, requesting the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to investigate and deal with them severely. Regarding judicial administration, several councilors raised questions about the slowness of punishing traitorous officials, the low salaries of judges, the need to increase their salaries in order to implement the rule of law and eliminate corruption in accordance with the principle of "adequate salaries to foster integrity," and the shortage of judges. The oral questioning was still not completed at 12:00 noon. The chairman announced that it would continue in the afternoon session. The spirit of the councilors hating evil like an enemy and exposing corruption was fully demonstrated during the questioning at today's meeting, moving the listeners. The eighth meeting was held at 3:20 PM, with Social Affairs Minister Gu Weiji attending to give a social report. Wang Yunwu presided over the meeting, with 154 councilors in attendance. Councilor Zhou Binglin attended for the first time. Gu's report was divided into four points: (1) Relief for unemployed workers and handling of labor-management disputes. (2) Development and enrichment of professional organizations. (3) Implementation of social relief work. (4) Development of cooperative enterprises, lasting for one hour. Due to time constraints, the number of questions raised by the councilors was very small, only He Chunfan, Wu Yunchu, Xue Mingjian, Zhang Shouyue, Li Jianzhi, and Wu Wangji inquired about the China Labor Association having received $600,000 in donations from American workers, but the association did not use the funds for the welfare of workers, but as capital for political activities, which should be investigated, and the problems after the takeover of factories. The Federation of Industry and Commerce should strengthen its organization and determine wage standards to prevent labor unrest. Finally, Minister Gu replied, stating briefly: "Labor discipline takes the national interest as its premise and will strive to maintain it." There are factual difficulties in improving agricultural professional organizations and cooperative institutions. Adjusting wage standards varies from place to place, but the general principle is to take into account both the livelihood of workers and the welfare of industry. Gu also stated: "The Labor Association is a cultural organization, not a statutory workers' organization. It is true that American workers donated to the association. The association has now made personnel adjustments to ensure that the association truly becomes an institution for research and culture."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Harbin, 24th] Recent rumors spread widely that a large force of Li Zhaolin's Anti-Japanese Army had entered Harbin, indeed approaching the city limits, creating an extremely tense situation. The Harbin branch of the Central Bank was also ordered to withdraw. Mayor Yang Chuo'an calmly handled the situation, and the Soviet army expressed full responsibility for security. Li Zhaolin's remains were buried at Daoli Park on the 24th. Li's forces did not enter the city; only representatives were sent to participate in the funeral procession, and the atmosphere began to ease slightly. The main culprit in Li's case has now been apprehended by the police bureau and is undergoing strict interrogation. There are no signs of withdrawal yet from the Soviet troops in northern Manchuria. The public eagerly anticipates the arrival of the National Army. The weather in Harbin is mild. The eight members of the municipal government and various departments receiving personnel are continuing to work as usual.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 23rd] Li Zhaolin, president of the Harbin-Soviet Friendship Association, was assassinated on the 9th. Memorial services were held in both Changchun and Harbin on the 24th. Li's remains were buried on the 24th in front of the former site of the Japanese shrine in the city.</p>

<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 24th] According to reliable sources close to the National Government, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will discuss sending an executive group to the Northeast as soon as possible to prevent a small spark from turning into a prairie fire. It is said that an agreement may be reached after Zhou Enlai returns to Chongqing tonight or tomorrow. Judging from news from the Northeast, there has not yet been a major conflict between the regional government and the Communist armies. However, it is imperative to transmit the ceasefire order to the Northeast and implement it before the Soviet troops withdraw; otherwise, there will be future disputes.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 24th] Authoritative sources here reported today that several teams of the executive group will travel to the Northeast in the coming days on airplanes piloted by American pilots. Therefore, the authority of the mediation executive headquarters will be expanded to that area. However, these sources emphasized that the executive group will avoid traveling to areas controlled by the Soviet army. Therefore, whether they will arrive in Changchun by the end of next week depends on whether the Soviet army has completely withdrawn from the city by then.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Security Council Meeting Opens Today; Soviet Union Takes Unexpected Action; Proposes Suggestions to Expand Veto Power; Iranian Prime Minister Denies Direct Negotiations with Soviet Union <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 24th Radio: Twenty-four hours before the Security Council meeting, the Soviet Union suddenly took an unexpected action. The Soviet side has submitted suggestions regarding procedural rules to the Drafting Committee. These suggestions would, in effect, give the Soviet Union the right to veto any country listing the Iranian issue as a "dispute." It is heard that the representatives of the United Kingdom and the United States will oppose these suggestions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 23rd, Associated Press] According to authoritative sources: The Soviet Union is attempting to expand the application of veto power in the United Nations Security Council. The Soviet Union suggests that even if the five major powers are parties to a dispute, they can also veto any resolution of the Council. In addition, the Soviet Union also suggests that any country, whether or not it is a member of the Security Council, should have the right to propose motions in the Security Council if it is a party to a dispute. It is learned that permanent procedural rules are currently being discussed, but there is no preparation to submit a report to the upcoming Security Council.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 24th Radio: The Iranian Prime Minister made an important speech today, denying that the Iranian side had conducted direct negotiations with the Soviet Union on the issue of the Soviet army's withdrawal from Iran. It is said that his negotiations in Moscow yielded no results, and there have been no new developments since his return to Iran, nor has he discussed this issue with anyone. The Iranian Prime Minister admitted that he had met with the new Soviet Ambassador to Iran twice, but said that he only introduced the new ambassador to the Iranian King in his capacity as Foreign Minister so that the Soviet ambassador could present his credentials. The Iranian Prime Minister also denied that he had submitted his resignation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 24th Radio: The Security Council will be held tomorrow. Iran's protest against the Soviet army's continued stay in northern Iran will be an international issue that must be discussed. It is believed that the relationship of the Iranian issue is not limited to the independence of that country, but contains extremely important significance. In Iran, newspapers and people attach importance to whether the Security Council can smoothly handle this incident. Washington admits that the purpose of the Soviet Union's actions in Iran is to ensure the Soviet Union's security, but in order to achieve this security, the Soviet Union is actively attempting to dominate Middle Eastern countries and weaken British and American influence. This point is no longer concealed in diplomatic circles.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 23rd] When the Security Council holds a meeting, Iran's accusation against the Soviet Union is currently listed as the third item on the agenda. However, according to Secretary-General Lai Yi, after the meeting, the agenda can be rearranged according to the American proposal, and the case will be immediately submitted for discussion.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 24th] During the United Nations Security Council meeting, the chiefs of staff of the five major powers of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, China, and France will study secret memoranda as the basis for United Nations military action.

<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 23rd, Special Dispatch] The Soviet representative Sobulev, Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations in charge of handling Security Council affairs, said that the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Gromyko, has been appointed as a permanent member of the Security Council and has arrived in New York from Washington. The Soviet Union nominated Gromyko as the chairman of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, while the Netherlands nominated Security Council permanent member Kleffens as the representative.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Truman Delivers Speech; Strengthen the Foundation of the United Nations; Never Retreat Because Peace Encounters Danger; World Trade Must Be Restored <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd] President Truman delivered a speech at the Jackson Memorial Day dinner today, saying, "The United States must lead towards a more perfect world order. We want to increase close friendship with all countries and will strengthen the foundation of the United Nations. We will never retreat because peace and progress encounter danger on the way, and we will achieve our goals regardless of all difficulties and create a prosperous and peaceful world. The world we need is one where all countries can trade with each other and with us. This means that other countries also have the opportunity to rebuild their war-torn countries and can also cooperate with the United States to maintain orderly transactions and exchange of goods. We have made great progress in this. Just a few days ago, the International Bank and the International Monetary Fund were established in Savannah, Georgia, according to the Bretton Woods Agreement. Therefore, President Jackson led social and political reforms and fought against reactionary forces, and his achievements are well known. Following this, there is another advocate of social justice who has revived these principles. This is the late President Roosevelt. If this great savior of the world were still with us today, he would happily inspire our courage and faith and lead us to strive to improve the fate of mankind everywhere. He would shout: Continue to struggle! The complete interruption of economic life has never been greater than that of our economic relations. During the war, most of the foreign trade was managed by the government and for the government. This must also be changed. World trade must be restored and must be restored to private enterprises." Truman's speech mostly involved domestic issues, calling on the Democratic Party to unite and take responsibility. America's leadership position in the world is due to the Democratic Party's "enlightened internationalism."</p>
<p>Vandenberg Doubts Soviet Intentions</p>
<p>[United Press, Grand Rapids, Michigan, 23rd] Senator Vandenberg declared tonight: If the United States and the Soviet Union each choose their own path, the United Nations organization is unlikely to survive in its current form. If Washington and Moscow guide their foreign policies with common sense and realism, there is no need for war between the Soviet Union and the United States. Although the progress of the United Nations structure so far is deeply exciting, the solution to the biggest mystery of modern times remains elusive. The so-called biggest mystery of modern times is what the Soviet Union's true intentions are now.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Grand Ledge, Michigan, 24th] US Senator Vandenberg demanded today that free elections be held in Poland, which has now become a Soviet satellite country. Otherwise, the United States should present this fact to the United Nations organization and demand a public trial.</p>

The first test will be held around July 1st, and another test will be held in December or January. The postponement date has not been determined. This matter has been discussed by the government, and the reason for the decision to postpone it is as President Truman said.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 24th] The White House yesterday denied that President Truman's order to postpone the atomic bomb test had anything to do with Marshal Stalin's speech supporting the United Nations organization.

Ross dismissed the various speculations about the postponement of the atomic bomb test as nonsense.</p>

<h3 id="e38">Spring Arrives in Jiangnan <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>"Apricot blossoms, spring rain in Jiangnan," this conjures up so much painting-like and poetic Jiangnan springtime scenery. People living in the city rarely have the opportunity to see apricot blossoms, but the spring rain in Jiangnan is always something that can be experienced; especially in the past month, the entire Jiangnan region has been immersed in the spring rain. The sound of trickling rain has accompanied the people of Jiangnan for a month. After a long period of rain, having deeply tasted the flavor of Jiangnan's spring rain, it is lovely to see the delicate spring sunshine. This is the first spring after the victory of the War of Resistance, and it should be joyful and exciting; however, looking at the current situation, one cannot help but feel somewhat heavy amid the joy and excitement. The news seen when opening the newspaper includes problems lurking within the United Nations organization, the Iranian issue, our Northeast problem, and also a constant stream of records as annoying as the spring. Regarding the United Nations organization, we see the following report: "The second session of the Security Council, which is under public scrutiny, is only three days away. British representative Cadogan and Stetinius are strengthening diplomatic warfare. They have been constantly consulting with representatives of various countries over the past two days, hoping to use a majority vote to reject the Soviet Union's proposal to postpone the meeting when discussing the first item on the agenda." Regarding Iran, it says: "Iran is tense while celebrating the New Year. Tehran is threatened by a coup. It is said that the leftist Democratic Party is planning to overthrow the government." Regarding the Northeast, according to a report from Changchun on the 22nd, the receiving personnel were evacuated from Weichun to Jinzhou by eight aircraft; another report stated that in the plain area between Liaoyang and Yingkou, nearly 100,000 unidentified armed troops have gathered in the past week. The leaders and their cadres mostly speak with Shandong and northern Jiangsu accents, and the weapons used are mostly Japanese-made, with many heavy artillery pieces attached.</p>
<p>However, what is thought-provoking is another piece of news that does not receive much attention; it reads as follows: "According to the person in charge of the Postal Administration, the 'Transportation Bureau' of the Communist Party suddenly sent personnel to 'take over' the areas of Qilin Town, Sanyang Town, Beixin Town, Jiulong Town, and the Qidong area under the jurisdiction of the postal district in this city at the beginning of last month, dispersing all the postal workers and issuing Mao Zedong stamps. Now the postal route between this city and that area has been interrupted. This happened within the postal district of Shanghai, and these places are only twenty or thirty miles away from the center of Shanghai." "Apricot blossoms, spring rain in Jiangnan," people in the city do not often see apricot blossoms, but apricot blossoms are sometimes cultivated in private courtyards within the city. Only twenty or thirty miles away from the decadent and extravagant Shanghai, what kind of situation is happening and developing?</p>
<p>Nantong, which faces Shanghai across the Yangtze River, according to a letter from a reader in Nantong to our newspaper, says: "Since the Japanese invaders surrendered, the people of Nantong naively thought they could live a happy life, but the opposite is true; the communist troops in the surrounding countryside are watching intently, and there is a possibility of being swallowed up at any time, so people are living in fear, especially the people in the countryside. After the National Army occupied the county seat, they exempted one year's land tax, but the New Fourth Army in the countryside forcibly levied public grain, and the amount levied was many times more than the exempted land tax. Almost all the rice and grain earned by tenant farmers was taken away by the New Fourth Army; they also issued 'Resistance Currency', using this worthless piece of paper to exchange for a large amount of cotton and cloth; then they sent people to transport the cotton and cloth to Nantong or Shanghai to buy bicycles and other military supplies. Thus, the materials that the common people worked hard for a year were all turned into 'Resistance Currency' printed with Mao Zedong's image... The political consultations above have no impact on them, but instead have intensified, prohibiting students from going out to study... The only authoritative news for the communist troops near Nantong is the 'Jianghuai Guide', which previously stated: 'On × month × day, the Nationalist troops ×× people, invaded Shigang, and were repelled by our defending troops. They fought fiercely in Yujiawei for a day and night and were unable to support themselves, and retreated to Fengjiadu'. At that time, the author was in Shigang, and not only did such things not happen, but there was no 'Fengjiadu' place in the Shigang area at all. The people of Shigang didn't know whether to laugh or cry after seeing it, but the communist parties in other places thought there was evidence that the Nationalist troops were not complying with the ceasefire agreement..."</p>
<p>These few days, after Mr. Zhou Enlai made a speech in Chongqing criticizing the KMT's Second Plenary Session for undermining the Political Consultative Conference agreements, he quietly flew back to Yan'an; the Communist Party representatives also avoided attending the National Political Consultative Conference held in the capital. Judging from the honest reports sent by our readers from Nantong, we can know who is plotting to undermine the results of the Political Consultative Conference. Spring rain in Jiangnan makes people feel depressed; but in the political field, isn't there also a feeling of annoyance like spring rain? Spring has arrived in Jiangnan, what kind of mood should the people of Jiangnan have?</p>

<p>Spring Harvest in Low-Lying Fields in the Northern Countryside is Hopeless</p>
<p>The northern countryside of this county is known as a low-lying area, with the area north of Lujia Bridge being the lowest, like the bottom of a pot. In this time of continuous spring rain, all the spring-ripening crops such as rapeseed and wheat in the low-lying fields have been flooded, forming a vast expanse of water, almost becoming a swamp.</p>

<p>The Suzhou Electric Light Factory Again Faces Coal Shortage</p>
<p>The Suzhou Power Plant, after ordering coal from Shanghai a week ago and transporting it to Suzhou, had only about 20 tons left as of the 22nd. Due to insufficient electricity transmission, it first partially stopped on the evening of the 22nd, and the entire city went dark at 10:30 p.m. The second batch of coal of more than 700 tons has not arrived yet due to continuous rainy days. If no coal arrives in Suzhou within two days, it will inevitably fall into complete darkness (including Wujiang and the Huxi area under the county). According to the person in charge of the factory: a coal ship previously loaded coal in Shanghai and sailed to Suzhou. When it passed near Gaochang Temple, it was sunk by a military ship. The remaining coal ships will arrive in Suzhou within a few days.</p>

<p>Measures for Fining Qingdao Opium Paste Shops</p>
<p>In the enemy-puppet era, 77 opium paste shops were licensed to open in Qingdao. After the police bureau was ordered to arrest their debtors one by one, they interrogated them several times and dealt with them with reference to the handling methods of opium paste shops in the recovered cities and provinces in North China. The third section of the police bureau and the responsible persons of the former opium paste shop association dispatched personnel to investigate the business conditions of the opium paste shops at that time and the situation of shareholders and managers one by one, and formulated differentiated grading fine measures. The use of the fines was (1) to make a set of uniforms for all officers, officials, and police officers of the Qingdao Police Bureau, and (2) to be used as funds for establishing a drug rehabilitation hospital. All the managers and agents of the opium paste shops who were detained have been released on bail. The police bureau has specially organized a clothing committee to publicly bid for the production, and after the bidding is announced, it will order the responsible persons of each shop to pay the uniform factory.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Grand Tea Party Held by the Engineering Community to Welcome the Engineering Planning Group - Over 300 Attended with Enthusiasm - Railway Group One Will Fly to Beiping this Morning and Proceed to North China <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan was recently organized and established, with the general headquarters in Shanghai, and will begin planning the restoration and construction of national railways, highways, port and water conservancy projects. The group is composed of 15 American engineers and 30 Chinese engineers, who are about to depart to various places for inspection. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, four groups, namely the Chinese Institute of Engineers, the Chinese Society of Automotive Engineers, the Chinese Power Engineering Association, and the Chinese Institute of Electrical Engineering, held a special tea party at the International Hotel to welcome them. Hou Jiayuan, the head of the Engineering Planning Group, Mao Yisheng, the deputy head, Dode, the chief engineer, Wang Jujun, the chief engineer of the railway group, Kang Shizhen, the chief engineer of the highway group, Shao Fuzuo, the chief engineer of the port group, and engineers from various groups, as well as over 300 member representatives from the Chinese Institute of Engineers, etc., attended.</p>
<p>Zhao Zukang Delivers Welcome Speech</p>
<p>First, Zhao Zukang, the president of the Chinese Institute of Engineers, delivered a welcome speech, stating briefly that all the staff of the Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan are well-known technical experts at home and abroad. Their arrival in Shanghai this time will surely provide much assistance and guidance for the city's restoration and construction. This city has been actively repairing roads since September last year, but due to funding and material difficulties, it has not been able to complete quickly. Currently, the total length of roads in the urban area is about 1,000 kilometers, all of which need to be repaired. There are also 500 kilometers of drainage channels (divided into sewage and rainwater) that need to be dredged, and they are now being carried out separately.</p>
<p>Chief Engineer Dode Delivers Speech</p>
<p>After Zhao's speech, Chief Engineer Dode of the Engineering Planning Group was invited to give a speech. He first explained that the 15 American engineers all work at the Morrison Knudsen Engineering Company in the United States. The company has done some practical work in South America and the Pacific Islands. Next, he explained the significance of coming to China to serve, which is to assist China in completing the restoration and construction of transportation and water conservancy projects. However, since the Engineering Planning Group has just been formed and has not yet set off for inspection, there is no actual material available for reporting. He then separately introduced the American engineers to everyone.</p>
<p>The Organization of the Group Has Extensive Significance</p>
<p>Next, Hou, the head of the Engineering Planning Group, gave a speech. He said that after the victory of the War of Resistance, the work of demobilization and restoration is very important, so the Engineering Planning Group was organized. The word "planning" has a very broad meaning, and usually plans cannot be executed, and they are easily reduced to empty paper materials, which are criticized by the general public. But the mission of this group is to do practical work, which must be completed within half a year. This year is the year of preparation for national construction, and all efforts must follow the most urgent and most needed paths. This group will adhere to this purpose to achieve success. However, the standard materials for various engineering plans still rely on the guidance of colleagues in the engineering community, and it is hoped that the Engineering Institute will often hold seminars on various practical engineering problems, gather ideas and discuss them, and provide this group with reference and lessons.</p>
<p>Mao Yisheng Introduces the Head of the Group</p>
<p>Deputy Head Mao Yisheng was invited to speak. Mao gave a very detailed introduction to the personal experience of Head Hou, praising Hou as the "Railway King." All railway construction from Hangzhou in the north to Myanmar in the south has been planned and managed by Hou. With his leadership, the Engineering Planning Group will naturally be able to fulfill its mission. As for the future work center of the group, Mao said that attention should be paid to the simultaneous development of railways, highways, ports, and water conservancy departments, but close contact and cooperation must be established with the Ministry of Transportation, the Water Conservancy Commission, the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and the national engineering community to avoid becoming a paper plan. After Mao finished speaking, Hu Songzhao, a representative of the Automotive Engineering Society, Chen Shiying, a representative of the Power Engineering Chang Society, and Haught, Tanks, and Wang Zhicheng, three engineers, gave speeches one after another, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic, until it dispersed at around 6:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Hou Jiayuan Gives a Speech</p>
<p>According to Head Hou, the group is divided into three groups: (1) the port group, with Wang Jujun as the chief engineer, (2) the highway group, with Kang Shizhen as the chief engineer, and (3) the railway group, with Wang Jujun as the chief engineer. Each group has one to three American advisers. The railway group will first go to North China to inspect the Tanggu New Port and the restoration projects of various railways in North China. The highway group will first go to the southwest to inspect highway projects. The port group will also go to North China to inspect water conservancy and port projects. The railway group is divided into four teams. The first team will fly to Beiping this morning and then go to North China for inspection. Also, Head Hou and Chief Engineer Dode will fly to Beiping by plane in early next month to inspect the construction of Tanggu Port.</p>

<h3 id="e43">U.S. Sailor Snatches Diamond Jewelry and Refuses Arrest, with No Way to Escape, Commits Suicide Out of Fear of Punishment - A Police Sergeant on Bush Road Shot and Injured in the Hand <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper) Yesterday afternoon on Linsen Road (i.e., Avenue Joffre), a U.S. sailor robbed a diamond ring from a jewelry store and tried to escape with the stolen goods, and also opened fire to resist arrest. Because he had no way to escape, he committed suicide out of fear of punishment. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Linsen Road</p>
<p>At about 3:30 p.m. yesterday, a U.S. soldier named Dahl entered Dachang Jewelry Store at No. 568 Linsen Road, claiming that he wanted to buy a diamond ring. Wu Yuzhi, a shop assistant, took out five diamond rings of different sizes and let him choose. The soldier selected three of them, including a diamond ring with 31 small diamonds, a diamond ring with 31 small diamonds, and a diamond ring with 23 small diamonds, estimated to be worth 450,000 legal tender.</p>
<p>The U.S. Soldier</p>
<p>After examining them for a long time, he put them on his fingers one by one, and then suddenly rushed out the door. Shop assistant Wu Yuzhi chased after him, shouting "Thief!" along the way. When the U.S. soldier went from Linsen Road to Chengdu Road South and turned to Bush Road, Sergeant Li Shaoji, No. 83, and police officer No. 4950 were patrolling here and bravely chased after him. At that time, the U.S. soldier heard the noise behind him and the number of pursuers was increasing, so he ran into Hehe Lane. Because one side of the alley was blocked, he came back out and ran,</p>
<p>Actually Opened Fire</p>
<p>Two shots were fired to resist arrest. One bullet grazed the hand of Sergeant Li, but fortunately it was minor. Seeing that the sergeant was injured, police officer No. 4950 behind him drew his gun and fired three shots in return, but none hit. The U.S. soldier crossed Chongqing South Road and passed through Bush Road to the alley behind the Jiuxing Grand Theater on Julu Road, but he knew that this alley was also blocked. At this point, knowing that there was no way to escape, he shot himself. The bullet penetrated his right temple and exited his left temple, and he immediately fell to the ground, barely breathing. Later, the U.S. military police team on Luban Road was notified and immediately sent many military police officers to the scene by car. They carried the U.S. soldier to the U.S. Army Hospital at No. 400 Haig Road, where he died despite treatment. The injured Sergeant Li was taken to the police hospital for medical treatment.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Shanghai's Roads - Total Length Approximately 1,000 Kilometers - Over Half of Road Repairs Completed After Victory - Large-Scale Repairs Await Overseas Materials <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Canglong</p>
<p>If you haven't forgotten, you should remember Shanghai's roads eight years ago. The smoothness of Nanjing Road, the straightness of Xiafei Road, the spaciousness of Minguo Road... But after eight years of enemy occupation, the iron hooves left scars on the road surface, and the devil's claws seized the tram tracks, leaving behind those ugly deep grooves... How to repair the old and renovate the new? How to open up new roads? Especially today, when Shanghai is repeatedly called the world's first-class metropolis, how can we complete the basic condition of smooth roads, even if we have to exert the energy of a young China?</p>
<p>According to the Public Works Bureau, since taking over road administration on September 12th last year, a surveying team was established. The survey results showed that the total length of roads in the city is equivalent to three times the distance from Shanghai to Nanjing, roughly 1,000 kilometers. An area of 340,000 square meters of this 1,000-kilometer road surface was found to be damaged. After the Public Works Bureau started work, the city was divided into six major work zones. These damaged roads have been successively repaired by the work zones. It is said that 200,000 square meters of damaged road surface have been repaired.</p>
<p>However, due to material shortages and too many roads needing repair, the current material used to repair major roads is still the smelly asphalt purchased from the Shanghai Gas Company, which can only cope with winter road repairs and will melt in the summer. Small and remote roads can only be repaired by scattering gravel into the potholes. This barely works. After a few heavy-tonnage military trucks drive over them, the potholes reappear. Therefore, old wounds are barely repaired when new wounds appear, endlessly cycling. People who don't pay attention won't notice that road repair work is underway.</p>
<p>When can Shanghai's roads be thoroughly repaired on a large scale? The director of the Public Works Bureau's road department told me that this time will not be too long, because the bureau has recently ordered a large batch of asphalt oil from the United States, which is expected to arrive by the end of April. Once the raw materials arrive, thorough repairs can be implemented.</p>
<p>The construction materials of Shanghai's roads can be roughly divided into four categories: (1) Cement concrete roads, (2) Asphalt concrete roads, (3) Sett roads, and (4) Cinder roads. The first type of road has the highest construction cost and is the most durable. There are not many of these roads in the city, such as the section of Ninghai West Road (formerly Rue Wagner). This type of road is highly susceptible to expansion and contraction due to hot and cold weather, so a small gap is left at regular intervals to allow for expansion. The second type of road also has a considerable construction cost, and the damage is currently the most severe. The main roads, such as Nanjing Road, Jinling Road, Linsen Road, and Zhongzheng Road, are representative of this type of road. The third type of sett road is made up of ordinary, irregularly sized stones pieced together. These roads are most common in the Nanshi area, and the road surfaces are uneven, making them the least popular among pedestrians and vehicles. The last type, cinder roads, are more common in the suburbs.</p>
<p>The road widening plan that has been initially realized is only the road on the north side of the Nanjing West Road Racecourse, which has been widened to 20 meters. However, the plans to widen Jielu Road to 35 meters and Zhejiang Road to 20 meters have been shelved due to the issue of demolishing houses. In today's housing shortage, this plan has been virtually stranded. However, it is guessed that the authorities intend to promote the entire road administration from the standpoint of benefiting the majority of citizens. It is said that the design of the entire urban road system will be based on existing airfields, stations, and docks, and the distribution and arrangement of roads will be coordinated accordingly!</p>

<p>Speed is Sixteen to Eighteen Nautical Miles per Hour</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The U.S.'s latest (C4) type merchant vessel, operating on the Pacific Sino-American route, the first American President Lines' World Banner Sea Arrow, arrived in Shanghai at the end of last month. It then departed Shanghai at the beginning of this month for Southeast Asia, passing through European ports and returning to New York via the Atlantic Ocean. It is learned that the company's second new vessel, the Sea Bao, carrying a large batch of relief supplies from New York to China, has now arrived at Dagu Port in Tianjin. After unloading the North China relief supplies, it is expected to arrive in Shanghai in early next month. It is also learned that the U.S. Foree Steamship Company has also built four new (C4) type mail ships operating on the Sino-American route. It is reported that the first China Mail has departed from Seattle, passing through San Francisco to Luzon, Hong Kong, and Shanghai, and is expected to arrive today. The vessel has a deadweight of 14,000 tons, a speed of 16 to 18 nautical miles per hour, and is equipped with modern facilities, including refrigerated compartments suitable for transporting fresh produce. Therefore, in addition to fruits loaded from the U.S., it has also loaded a large quantity of mangoes from Luzon. It will stay in Shanghai for three or four days and is scheduled to depart Shanghai for the U.S. on the 29th, heading directly to Seattle. According to the vessel's speed, it only takes two weeks to travel from Shanghai to Seattle, making it the fastest mail ship today.</p>

<p>Most of the agencies under the U.S. Military Headquarters in this area are preparing to close. According to reporters, the various departments of the U.S. military will determine the order of their closure based on how long they are needed, demobilizing separately between April and May. General Wedemeyer is scheduled to leave China and return to the U.S. on the 2nd of next month. His work will be temporarily taken over by General Wedemeyer's Chief of Staff, Major General Matt. It is not known whether General Wedemeyer will return to China after returning home. In addition, many ships have been allocated to transport troops back to the U.S. to handle demobilization. The General Cheatham is scheduled to sail from Seattle, USA, in late March and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on April 15, transporting most of the U.S. military back to the U.S. The Navy's USS Attu is also scheduled to arrive in China in May. The work of transporting U.S. troops back to the U.S. is likely to be largely completed in May of this year.</p>
<p>Unfinished Work Must Continue</p>
<p>The work that is becoming more intense with the demobilization of the U.S. military includes the U.S. Military Advisory Group in China led by General Magruder, the Executive Headquarters led by Special Envoy Marshall, and the U.S. Foreign Surplus Property Disposal Committee headed by General Georgeson. According to reports from various sources, Marshal Marshall will return to China soon, and his representative, General Gillem, is carrying out all of Mr. Marshall's duties in Chongqing. The heads of the various departments of the Executive Headquarters responsible by the U.S. held an important meeting in Chongqing at 9:00 PM last night. All the key U.S. military personnel of the Executive Headquarters flew from Peiping and Shanghai to Chongqing for the meeting the day before yesterday afternoon or yesterday morning. General Wedemeyer has announced that although the U.S. military is engaged in demobilization, the unfinished work must continue to be completed.</p>

<p>Hoping the Health Bureau Will Immediately Investigate and Handle Properly</p>
<p>Dear Editor: Today, I am talking about the garbage problem in Shanghai, which is currently the most serious and urgently needs to be handled by the health authorities. It is said that the amount of garbage accumulated in the city every day is huge, reaching thousands of tons. Before the war, the Ministry of Public Works and merchants hired wooden barges to transport the garbage to designated locations for unloading, and there were water police to monitor to prevent boatmen from cheating. But now, the boatmen, disregarding public morality and seeking convenience, load the garbage to a point a little past [name unclear] Hua, in the river area called the Garbage Beach, and dump it into the river without unloading it on the shore, and no one investigates. This garbage is all filthy and unbearable, and the Huangpu River is the source of drinking water for the entire city. Now that garbage is thrown into the river, the citizens are ingesting large amounts of bacteria, how can they not get sick and endanger their lives? Moreover, as it accumulates over time, the Huangpu River will become clogged, and will the traffic between Jiangsu and Zhejiang be affected? Your newspaper serves the community, and I hope you will grant a small space to publish this article, so that during this period of promoting cleanliness and dredging the Huangpu River, the relevant authorities will see it and immediately send personnel to investigate and deal with it, in order to eliminate this harm and benefit the citizens. Sincerely yours, reader Yao Datian.</p>

This period has now expired, but honorary chairman Wang Xiaolai, chairman Huang Yantang, president Liang Yuming, and chief standing director Huang Yongqing, given the current high prices and the precarious lives of the poor, feel that the soup kitchen should not be stopped. They have made every effort to raise funds and have decided to continue the soup kitchen for another two months from April 1, again at the Society.

<h3 id="e63">Gold Prices Stabilize, Speculation Concentrates on Securities, Including New "Full Position" Tickets <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Since the Central Bank of China (CBC) allocated gold measured in rice, the financial trend has gradually stabilized. Speculation has shifted its target to raising the prices of Chinese and foreign stocks and government bonds. In the commodity sector, the rise in rice and grains is the most stimulating. High-quality rice consistently fluctuates around 31,000 to 32,000 yuan. Flour sales are quite strong, and prices are also tight, with "Warship Brand" once hitting the 10,000 yuan mark. Cooking oil briefly surged to 63,000 to 64,000 yuan, but then retreated to around 60,000 yuan. A detailed overview is provided below:</p>
<p>Gold: Last week, the trend of cooked (refined) gold was calm. However, on Monday, the news of the US suggestion to raise gold prices, coupled with the CBC's allocation of 1.62 million units, boosted sentiment, causing prices to fluctuate between 1.6 million and 1.7 million yuan. From Tuesday to Friday, the trend weakened. The CBC maintained the allocation price at 1.6 million yuan from Monday onwards, but the gold industry's absorption was not enthusiastic, and the black market price was already lower than the allocation price.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency: On Monday, US dollars hovered above 2,000 yuan. Because the US exchange rate remained stable, sentiment was idle, and supply and demand were scarce. Only money exchangers engaged in slight buying and selling. From Tuesday to Saturday, it retreated below 2,000 yuan, struggling above 1,900 yuan, with uncertain gains and losses. Old Hong Kong dollars remained stable at around 404. New issues (namely, the 1936 and 1937 series) suddenly became popular. Starting on Wednesday, a certain bank in the city created activity, attracting attention. Foreign firms took the opportunity to snap them up, and due to a shortage of chips (available currency/assets), a rising trend suddenly emerged. As of Saturday, it was still steadily climbing, exceeding 220 yuan and reaching around 230 yuan, already surpassing double the price of old issues.</p>
<p>Consolidated Bonds: Unified public bonds saw little interest from Monday to Friday, with narrow fluctuations. Category C bonds hovered above 1,600 yuan, fluctuating only by 30 to 50 yuan. On Saturday, due to speculators' desire for movement after extreme stillness, a buying trend suddenly emerged, and prices were firm. Category C once exceeded 2,000 yuan but then retreated to 1,920 yuan. Categories A and B rose to 1,005 yuan, Category D to 1,011 yuan, and Category E to 1,013 yuan.</p>
<p>Stocks: After the stabilization of gold prices, speculative groups sold off gold and switched to stocks, leading to a significant surge in the stock market. The market trend continued to rise. On Tuesday, foreign stocks saw a collective decline due to excessive floating profits. On Wednesday, Chinese stocks showed a very stable trend, especially in the afternoon, when the momentum was sharp. After yarn mills crossed the 4,000 yuan mark, they continued to advance, and other stocks followed suit. Foreign stocks also saw many gains amid a chorus of buying. On Thursday, buying sentiment permeated Chinese stocks, and the market trend shifted from large-cap stocks to small-cap stocks. Jingfu and Qinxing both broke through the 300 yuan mark. The rising trend of Xinguang was also fierce. Retail investors in foreign stocks sold off, and prices retreated slightly. On Friday, Chinese stocks initially experienced a slight setback at the opening, but later, large investors pushed up prices, and a fierce rising trend was sparked again among the "three smalls" (small cap stocks). The gains of large-cap stocks were relatively flat. Sentiment in foreign stocks was boosted, and they moved towards new highs. Over the weekend, Guangdong investors continued to absorb Chinese stocks relentlessly, continuing to push up prices and create new highs. The gains of foreign stocks were uneven, with Asia and Jardine Matheson being the most prominent.</p>
<p>Raw Yarn: Last week, initially supported by the rising trend of the previous weekend, coupled with strong buying from Guangdong investors, the trend was extremely strong, and prices hovered at high levels. 60-count Sunlight double-strand fine yarn once reached as high as 2.8 million yuan. Although major buyers such as Yuehan continued to purchase actively, the pressure was heavier due to the textile construction company taking over Japanese-owned yarn mills and operating day and night, actively producing yarn. Therefore, the rising trend gradually weakened. The highest price for the entire week was 2.8 million yuan for 60-count Sunlight yarn on Monday, and the lowest was 510,000 yuan for 10-count Jiahe yarn on Thursday. Except for 20-count Special Double Horse, which rose independently, all yarns uniformly softened, especially 42-count Blue Phoenix, which plummeted by 170,000 yuan, the most significant decline.</p>
<p>Fabric Market: Due to weak sales from buyers and distributors, and increased output from manufacturers, the market had an ample supply of chips (available product). The market trend was consistently weak for days, with all brands uniformly weakening by 3,000 to 6,000 units (currency unit not specified).</p>
<p>Cotton Market: Because the textile construction company took over Japanese-owned yarn mills and urgently needed raw materials, the purchase of fine cotton raw materials was quite large, so market prices remained firm. Only Zhoupu seed cotton was slow to move, falling by 7,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Rice and Grains: At the beginning of the week, the rice market rose due to continuous spring rains. Flour and cooking oil were both profitable, and sugar continued to decline. Local cotton and rice were particularly bleak. The next day, rice prices rose again by 2,000 yuan due to reports of price increases from production areas. On Wednesday, the weather cleared, and rice arrivals were particularly smooth, causing the market to turn towards easing, with uniform declines. Flour also softened. In terms of miscellaneous grains, raw peanuts had a particularly strong momentum, rising sharply by about 3,000 yuan. On Thursday, the source of rice increased, and the market trend continued to loosen, with high-quality rice falling by 500 yuan, and medium-to-low quality rice falling by 1,000 to 1,500 yuan. Flour was mediocre. Sales of cooking oil were matched by arrivals, with a slight drop of 500 yuan. Sugar flooded in, and the market trend was depressed. On Friday, the rice market showed a strong trend again due to rainy weather, with prices rising by several hundred to 1,500 yuan. Flour sales were active, also up by about 300 yuan. Miscellaneous grains uniformly declined, and cooking oil arrivals flooded the market with sluggish sales, causing a decline. Over the weekend, the rice market was initially firm and then weakened, with prices mostly the same as yesterday. Flour prices were high in other regions, rising again by over 400 yuan. In terms of miscellaneous grains, soybeans turned better by 300 to 500 yuan, raw peanuts saw mixed gains and losses, cooking oil declined by several hundred yuan, and bean cakes also fell by several tens of yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Eliminating the Division System, Concentrating Check Clearing, All Foreign Banks Participate <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Before the war, due to the special circumstances of the environment, the check clearing system could not be centralized. For example, foreign banks' checks were jointly managed by HSBC and the Bank of China, while Chinese banks' checks were managed by the Shanghai Banking Association's Joint Reserve Committee's check clearing house, and money shops were managed by the Money Shop Association's Joint Reserve. After the victory, after the strenuous efforts of the financial authorities to improve the system, the divided system was eliminated, and centralized clearing was implemented. Banks and money shops found it convenient, and the results were excellent.</p>
<p>153 Clearing Banks and Money Shops</p>
<p>The Shanghai Check Clearing House is a merger of the original check clearing houses of the banking and money shop industries, and a new organizing committee manages all business. Representatives from the Central Bank of China (CBC) serve as the chairman of the committee. The "Four Banks, Two Bureaus" (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, Central Trust Bureau, Postal Savings Bureau) and all foreign banks participate in the clearing. The allocation and settlement of all clearing balances between the banks and money shops are centralized at the CBC. As of last week, there were a total of 50 clearing numbers, meaning there were 35 directly clearing banks and 15 money shops. There were 63 banks, 33 money shops, and 7 trust companies that did not obtain clearing numbers and used agents for clearing. Banks and money shops that obtained clearing numbers opened accounts directly with the CBC to handle the allocation and settlement of clearing balances. Banks and money shops that did not obtain clearing numbers opened current accounts with the clearing house, and the clearing house deposited the daily clearing balance into the CBC, simplifying the procedure and unifying management.</p>
<p>Clearing Amount Increases Daily</p>
<p>Since the clearing house was improved and centralized, the daily total clearing amount can be checked on the same day, and the actual situation of market changes can be known at any time. For example, the check clearing amount in February of this year was 459,251,266,270.62 yuan, and the amount of checks cleared by agents was 208,453,034,719.64 yuan, totaling 667,704,300,990.16 yuan. The check clearing amount in January was 306,972,070,945.86 yuan, and the amount cleared by agents was 129,868,936,756.59 yuan, totaling 436,841,007,702.45 yuan. Therefore, the February amount increased by 50% compared to January, which reflects the expansion of market liquidity, rampant speculation, and price fluctuations in February. In the most recent two weeks, the average number of checks cleared daily has been around 10,000, and the clearing amount has also been increasing daily.</p>

<p>[Reuters, New York, 24th] It is reported that Peru's new cotton is expected to have a bumper harvest due to evenly distributed rainfall.

<h3 id="e66">US Tung Oil Production Reaches Half of Its Consumption <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, China's foreign trade has almost completely stalled. In particular, tung oil, because it is widely needed in the United States, had over thirty substitutes developed. The most effective of these were linseed oil, perilla oil, oiticica oil, and dehydrated castor oil. Currently, the United States has planted tung trees on an area of ​​approximately 20,000 acres, with last year's output being 6.7 million pounds, only half of its consumption. Since the abolition of US tung oil controls, the maximum consumption is said to be as high as one million pounds. Therefore, there is a great hope that China's high-quality tung oil will be exported in large quantities.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Arrivals from Home and Abroad: Glass... Cement... Mangoes <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Large quantities of glass and cement arrived in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Yuezhou wheel, which returned to Shanghai from Qinhuangdao, transported 6,000 cases of glass and 8,500 bags of cement. It arrived in the evening, berthed at buoys number six and seven, and was unloaded yesterday.</p>
<p>Luzon mangoes, which have not been seen for many years, are about to arrive in Shanghai. It is reported that the China Post ship of the Foo Lai Steamship Company, which is making its first voyage from Seattle to China, via San Francisco to Little Luzon, and then via Hong Kong to Shanghai, is expected to arrive around Monday or Tuesday next week. The ship has loaded a large batch of mangoes from Little Luzon. Having not been seen for six years, they can now be tasted again.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Economic Briefs <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The Provincial Bank Regulations have recently been promulgated, providing detailed provisions for the responsibilities and powers of local banks in various provinces. The financial department previously stationed supervisory officers in various provincial banks, but they are no longer necessary. It is reported that orders have been issued to abolish them.</p>
<p>The British government restricts overseas remittances to 45 yuan of remittance currency per person per month. This was noted in this newspaper. If the first batch exceeds this amount, it will be deducted in the following month. It is also stipulated that the total number of overseas Chinese in Nanyang (Southeast Asia) is used as the calculation base. If there are 1,000 overseas Chinese in Nanyang, then the monthly remittance limit is 45,000 yuan. Therefore, recent overseas remittances from Nanyang have been interrupted invisibly due to this restriction. The Star-Chang Bureau (a financial institution) explained that this is a small financial measure from the military government era, and it will be abolished once the military administration ends.</p>
<h3 id="e69">From the Perspective of Legal Orthodoxy: Discussing the Inspection of Factory Boilers <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Heqing</p>
<p>I recently read a news item on page 3 of your newspaper on the 17th of this month regarding the Municipal Bureau of Public Works' inspection of factory boilers, which stated: "The Municipal Bureau of Public Works, in order to prevent fires in factories and protect the safety of factories, neighboring buildings, workers, and the general public, has sent personnel to various factories to investigate boilers, electrical equipment, machines, and layout positions. If any factory equipment is found to be dangerous, they are instructed to move or improve it immediately. As of the end of February, more than 400 factories have been inspected, and more than 800 boilers have been registered..." After reading this news, I feel very surprised. It is indeed an urgent need for the Bureau of Public Works to carry out inspections for the safety of people and citizens in factories, but the question is to which administrative system does it belong?</p>
<p>According to the news report, the inspection work carried out by the Bureau of Public Works is clearly stipulated by national laws and must be carried out by specific factory inspection agencies. This factory inspection work had been exclusively and jointly carried out by the Shanghai Factory Inspection Institute for five or six years before the Anti-Japanese War. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Ministry of Social Affairs in the Great Rear Area directly trained legal personnel and sent them to various industrial zones to carry out inspection work without interruption. The person in charge of the current Bureau of Public Works must not be unfamiliar with the factory inspection system!</p>
<p>Factory inspection work is considered a very important administrative matter in all industrially advanced countries. The governments of various countries are particularly cautious about this work and implement it very strictly. It cannot be done by one or two scholars who only understand engineering, because the scope involved is very broad. Therefore, the National Government has been particularly cautious about this work. Since 1929, the Factory Law, the Factory Law Implementation Regulations, the Factory Inspection Law, and the Factory Safety and Sanitation Regulations have been promulgated successively. Before 1931, the Ministry of Industry once held a factory inspector training institute in this city to train a batch of legal inspectors and send them to various provinces and cities to carry out inspection work. In 1933, in order to further promote inspection work, the central government specially established the Central Factory Inspection Office in the capital to specialize in this matter. In September 1931, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs established a special section to appoint trained personnel to carry out inspection work. This is not an ordinary administrative work. In 1933, the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities also planned to get involved in boiler inspection. At that time, there was a debate on the issue of legal orthodoxy at the municipal meeting. As a result, this was a specific power granted by law to factory inspectors and should of course be carried out by factory inspectors. At the same time, for the fire protection issues in factories, the Bureau of Social Affairs also had a written dispute with the Public Security Bureau. Unexpectedly, the current Bureau of Public Works wants to overturn the old case from more than ten years ago.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Public Works' current inspection work also has a history. This evolution was left over from the puppet government era. Tracing back to 1937, after the National Army withdrew to the west, the Public Works Bureau of the then Public Concession also had factory inspection work, which was presided over by Ms. Xing De, who recently returned to Shanghai. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Japanese army entered the concession, and the factory inspection work was taken over by the Japanese. After the concession was taken back by the puppet government in a sham operation, the Public Works Bureau was renamed the First District Public Office. At that time, the inspection work was the responsibility of the Industrial Social Affairs Department. Last year, in the first half of the year, when the First District Public Office was abolished, the original inspection work of the Industrial Social Affairs Department was inexplicably merged into the Bureau of Public Works. After the victory, the receiving officers who flew from Chongqing took over all the files and personnel of the Bureau of Public Works, and Xiao followed the rules and continued to inherit the same pattern, so this work, which is clearly stipulated by national law and must be undertaken by specifically trained factory inspectors, was still carried out by the Bureau of Public Works.</p>
<p>The author does not oppose the implementation of factory inspection work, but this work, a system and legal orthodoxy that has been established for more than ten years, should be observed by both the government and the people. Especially in a country ruled by law, legal orthodoxy should be maintained and should never be undermined. The author is purely out of love for the factory inspection system to remind the government authorities to pay attention to the legal orthodoxy of this work. From the perspective of the industrial sector in this city, it is also hoped that the competent government authority managing factories should preferably be concentrated in one government office, which will preside over and manage it. The government can achieve twice the result with half the effort, and factories can also avoid many unnecessary troubles. It is hoped that the Bureau of Public Works will return this inspection work to the legal agency for execution as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In order to transfer the legal orthodoxy of this factory inspection power, there is a very important prerequisite that must be resolved, that is, the issue of Shanghai's factory inspection agencies should be resolved as soon as possible and restored as soon as possible. It is hoped that the Ministry of Social Affairs should not only address the issue of Shanghai, but also the entire factory inspection system in the country should be stipulated as soon as possible and established as soon as possible, so that both labor and management have something to rely on, and there will be no similar legal orthodoxy issues.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Municipal Elementary School Staff Association Sets External Responsibilities <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency] The seventh regular meeting of the board of directors of the Municipal Elementary School Staff Association, in addition to listening to the association's representatives' report to the Bureau of Education on the disbursement of salary arrears and the temporary advance of emergency salaries of 50,000 to 80,000 yuan, expressed disagreement regarding the general representatives' meeting convened on the 23rd, where important issues were discussed without prior notification to the representatives of various schools, and the suspension of the joint deliberation of all directors of the board of directors. The association is the executive body entrusted by the general assembly to carry out association affairs, so it could not recognize the resolutions of a small number of representatives and stipulated that all external contact matters should be the responsibility of personnel appointed by the board of directors. In addition, for the purpose of introducing occupations, job registration forms have been set up. The contact points are located at Wanzhu Elementary School, Xiaozheng Road Elementary School, and He'an Elementary School. Those who need talent and those who seek teaching positions can make contact.</p>

<p>[Dahua News Agency] Recently, prices have increased several times compared to last year, so employees in all sectors have been demanding salary adjustments. The education sector, which is known for its integrity, is also unable to maintain itself due to the increasing difficulty of making a living. Therefore, the petitions of municipal elementary schools and the strikes of municipal middle schools have occurred one after another, and are now being discussed by representatives of various schools with the Bureau of Education. However, the treatment of private schools is even lower than that of municipal schools, so the issue of teacher salaries in various private primary and secondary schools in the city also urgently needs to be addressed. It is reported that the Private Primary and Secondary School Friendship Association will hold a special meeting to discuss solutions.</p>

<p>Regular Professional Women's Training To Be Held</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Hangzhou] The Hangzhou Women's Movement Committee held its third committee meeting the other day. Attendees included Peng Huixiu et al., chaired by Dai Guyin. The meeting resolved five items, which are recorded below: (1) Regularly hold professional women's training; (2) Promote the organization of a friendship association for female teachers and female workers in this city; (3) Hold women's refresher schools at five locations, namely Xianlin Bridge, Wulong Lane, Huansha Road, Chengtou Lane, and Gaoyin Lane; (4) Send a letter to the health authorities to establish a maternity hospital for the poor and promote maternal and child health; (5) Promote Hangzhou enthusiasts and ask social welfare authorities to run nurseries.

<h3 id="e74">Student Records Confirmed in the Capital <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing] After the victory, the student records of middle schools in the capital have been gradually sorted out and are now generally confirmed. A special analysis is provided:</p>
<p>University Preparatory Class Accommodating Preparatory Students</p>
<p>(1) The temporary university preparatory class established by the Ministry of Education, which has been discontinued, will accommodate preparatory students until the summer of this year. Those who pass the exam can also be admitted to regular universities after the summer. (2) Students who studied at several national secondary schools run by the puppet government will be accommodated by the Ministry of Education in three national temporary middle schools, No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3. Their student records will be graded according to their level during the entrance examination, and they will be rigorously assessed again during the winter vacation. (3) Municipal and private primary and secondary school education continued uninterrupted, but the principals of municipal schools were changed and adjusted in the winter after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. Most schools had screening effects during the winter vacation exams, so many students were dismissed, held back, or demoted.</p>
<p>Middle School Refresher Class Actual Study</p>
<p>(4) For young people who were studying in the free area but lost their schooling due to the environment and were displaced, the Ministry of Education's Recruitment and Training Committee (now renamed the Youth Re-enrollment and Employment Guidance Office) has established the Nanjing Youth Training Institute (similar schools for youth re-enrollment and employment are also located in Shanghai, Anhui, and Beiping) to accommodate and educate them. Among them, there are high and junior grades, with lectures on the main courses of middle school, and more civic and physical education training. In the past, the institute periodically distributed trained youth to various national temporary middle schools. It is now reported that in March, the training institute will be transformed into a refresher class for study advancement, expanding the curriculum to be consistent with that of general middle schools, still divided into high and junior grades for teaching. After the class change, it will be no different from general middle schools, and students will be assigned official student records. The class currently has 400 students, and it can be expanded to 500 students in the future depending on the school's capacity. The progress will be one semester for every four months of actual study without winter or summer vacations. When necessary, students can also be distributed to public middle schools to enter appropriate grade levels. ()</p>

<h3 id="e78">Mayor's Cup Soccer Semi-Finals: Donghua Eliminates Soviet Union Yesterday, Italian Overseas Chinese Defeat Yong'an and Also Obtain Qualification for the Semi-Finals <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the weather cleared up, and the long-awaited soccer game was held as usual. Although there was no tense situation, the enthusiasm was also very high. The two acts of the Mayor's Cup semi-finals both passed in a one-sided situation due to the disparity in strength. Italian Overseas Chinese won against Yong'an by a score of six to one, while Donghua won against the Soviet Union by a clean three goals.</p>
<p>In the game between Italian Overseas Chinese and Yong'an, Xue Weitai scored two goals in the first half, taking a 2-0 lead. In the second half, Italian Overseas Chinese's Weila scored a penalty kick first. After that, Yong'an's Zhou Baoshan scored one goal, avoiding a shutout. Xue Weitai then scored a hat-trick, eliminating Yong'an by a score of six to one.</p>
<p>The game between Donghua and the Soviet Union started at 3:00 PM. Donghua's Sun Jinshun went to Hangzhou, and Song Lingsheng took the position of left forward. The Soviet Union had Robert Stov assisting, but the overall strength of the team was insufficient. It was difficult for one tree to support a tall building. Donghua was still as active as usual, but due to the rain and lack of practice for a long time, Li Yao only passed to Dai Linjing to score one goal in the first half. In the second half, Han Longhai scored two goals in a row, and finally defeated the Soviet Union by a score of three to zero, successfully advancing. Donghua lineup:</p>
<p>Zhang Banglun</p>

<h3 id="e82">An Episode Before the Opening of the Political Consultative Conference: Premier Song's Informal Tea Party <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— A Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 21st by Our Newspaper's Correspondent Zhao Haosheng</p>
<p>The morning of the 21st was devoted to economic reports and inquiries. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, Premier Song of the Executive Yuan held a tea party in the Victory Building to entertain the Councilors.</p>
<p>In the hall, old-fashioned long tables were arranged in rows, with a short row of seats in the center. The walls of the auditorium were colorful, and the bright lights illuminated the white tablecloths and gleaming silverware, creating a magnificent sight.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Wenlong arrived the earliest. Around 4:00 PM, several large buses arrived one after another, and the venue immediately became lively. Many Councilors took advantage of this time to take out their own proposals and ask others to sign them. Many people were still discussing the storm of the economic report and inquiry in the morning with great interest.</p>
<p>A Lively Gathering and Enthusiastic Handshakes</p>
<p>Premier Song appeared at the door, still wearing a dark green suit with a white silk scarf around his neck. He walked along the long table, shaking hands enthusiastically with each Councilor, and finally reached the door.</p>
<p>At the entrance to the hall, Shao Lizi stood on the left, and Premier Song stood on the right. Weng Wenhao, Jiang Menglin in a long gown and mandarin jacket, and Premier Song stood in a row, greeting the people who arrived one after another.</p>
<p>The hall was full. Without being invited by the host, everyone automatically helped themselves to refreshments. Premier Song invited a few people to sit in the row of seats in the center. Premier Song sat in the middle, with Jiang Yong, Li Huang, Qian Xinzhi, and Wu Runchu on the left, and Huang Yanpei, Chu Fucheng, and Yu Feipeng on the right. Shao Lizi and Weng Wenhao sat at the ends of the long table. Zhang Lisheng and Zhu Jiahua, as co-hosts, sat in the middle of each table. Wang Shijie, as a guest, also placed himself among the crowd.</p>
<p>The host stood up to speak, and the whole room applauded enthusiastically. Qian Xinzhi, because he was holding a pipe in his left hand, had to raise a spoon in his right hand and tap the plate in front of him to express his welcome.</p>
<p>The Host Raises His Glass and Blesses Everyone</p>
<p>Premier Song spoke in pure Shanghai dialect. He said that he did not speak the last time he entertained the Councilors. He originally planned not to speak this time either, but Mr. Shao Lizi had just told him that it seemed that the situation had already created the need to speak, and it was impossible not to speak. He said that his political report would be given at the general meeting tomorrow morning. In order to avoid delays at the meeting, he invited everyone here today to chat casually first. Finally, he raised his teacup and gave everyone his blessings.</p>
<p>After the host spoke, Chu Fucheng stood up and talked about the seriousness of the price issue, hoping that Premier Song would quickly come up with a solution. He talked about the sealing of goods and gold bar activities in Shanghai, and the difficulty of buying rice in Hangzhou. He kept waving the napkin in his hand to emphasize his tone.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Yanpei Speaks as He Walks</p>
<p>Jiang Yong stood up and, as usual, raised his glass to thank the host. It seemed that the meeting was already coming to an end, but Huang Yanpei suddenly stood up to speak at this time. As usual, he greeted everyone first, but his movements were too slow, and many people had already stood up. His speech had already begun, and it was not good to stop abruptly, so he had to continue speaking. But people were already leaving their seats and walking outside. In this situation of scattering and speaking, Mr. Huang's speech ended inaudibly.</p>
<p>The meeting adjourned, and the hosts stood at the door again to shake hands and say goodbye to everyone. The last person to walk out was Huang Yanpei. (21st)</p>
<h3 id="e83">Evening Scenery of Beng Mountain: A Heavy Town on the Huai River Shows its Beauty <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>*Report from this newspaper on the 21st. Contributed by Correspondent Qian Mengchao*</p>
<p>Bengbu is my second hometown. Before my current position, I lived in this city, which boasts both northern and southern Chinese scenery, for over a decade. I only tearfully left this beloved second home on the eve of its fall in early February of the 27th year. The victorious news filled me with excitement, and I finally returned to this important town on the Huai River from the provisional capital with a joyful heart.</p>
<p>Beng Mountain is Well</p>
<p>It is still doing well, the scenery as before. The several roads crisscrossing the city are still rugged and uneven, and the tall and short buildings on both sides have not changed much in the past eight years. Beng Mountain, standing tall on the southern edge of the city, remains graceful and well-arranged, with lush flowers and trees adorning this bright spring scenery. However, at the eastern and western foothills, many houses formerly occupied by the enemy and puppets have been added. Beng Mountain has endured more than seven years of bloody rule. Although the Japanese invaders surrendered in exhaustion, and the land has regained its light, the stains and traces here cannot be washed away even by flooding the Huai River.</p>
<p>Sightseeing at Zhongshan Park</p>
<p>Beng Mountain stands within Zhongshan Park, the only scenic spot for city residents to visit. Yesterday, I took advantage of a wisp of the setting sun in the evening after a rainstorm, and made a tour, my first visit since returning from Chongqing. The Cemetery of Anti-Japanese War Martyrs at the southern foot of the mountain was meticulously built by General Xu Tingyao. The cemetery still exists, but it has been neglected for many years and is gradually deteriorating. At the eastern foot of the mountain, the bronze statue of the famous Northern Expedition General Ma Wenbo has long disappeared. It is said that it was dismantled and taken away by the enemy. The tomb has been moved to the northern foot, and a stone tablet inscribed by the traitor Wang Jingwei stands majestically in front of the tomb. This stain should be removed as soon as possible. In addition, attractions such as "Dispelling the Clouds," the Sanmin Pond, and the Bandit Suppression Memorial Tower still exist, but the Fire Alarm Pavilion on the mountain ridge has been renovated. Soldiers are stationed here, prohibiting visitors from approaching.</p>
<p>The Huai River Winds Like a Snake</p>
<p>The Huai River resembles a long snake winding its way. Since the Yellow River reversed and flooded the upper reaches of the Huai River last year, the river water has taken on an orange-yellow color, as if dyed by countless grains of yellow sand. Little Bengbu, north of the river, still retains the appearance of a village. The old and new wharves on the south bank of the river have been completely transformed into mud and sand due to years of siltation, and no longer serve as mooring places for ships. Many thatched sheds have been built nearby. Recently, it has been said that the authorities plan to open a new eastern wharf behind Yuzi, east of the railway. Surveys have been conducted several times, but when construction will begin is still unknown.</p>
<p>Evening Scenery of the Huai River is Picturesque</p>
<p>The large iron bridge spanning the Huai River still maintains its majestic posture. Trains between Pukou and Xuzhou rush across it day and night several times a day. I recall that on the eve of Bengbu's fall in the 27th year, the National Army used explosives to destroy it, but it was soon repaired and reopened by the enemy. The scene is still vivid, but in these seven years, Bengbu has witnessed countless tragic events worthy of song and tears, and has also created countless hateful and shameful scandals.</p>
<p>A distant view of the Huai River at dusk, with sails like forests and seagulls flying over the water, people in the setting sun and twilight smoke, is truly a picturesque natural scene full of poetic charm.</p>
<p>Noisy Songs in the Northern District</p>
<p>The Huachang Street area and the alley in the Grand Hotel on Second Road were once famous pleasure quarters. Countless prominent figures, scholars, wealthy merchants, politicians, and military men left their traces and stories here. After eight years of the torrent of the Anti-Japanese War, these filthy places have still not been completely washed away.</p>
<p>Most of these "flowers" from the northern district are from Jiangdu and Xicheng. They perm their hair, powder their faces, apply lipstick, and wear high heels. Each one is fashionably dressed, no different from those in Shanghai. Every evening, when the lights are lit, there is a constant stream of traffic. The women, like flowers, flutter about in the streets, some leaving to serve customers, cooing and feigning anger, singing lewd songs. While this is certainly disgusting, there are still many who lavish money on them. The local public security authorities collect "flower taxes" as usual, reportedly 5,000 yuan per person per month. It is estimated that there are more than 300 prostitutes engaged in prostitution in Bengbu. Every evening, the scenery is beautiful and the music is loud, and one can imagine the situation.</p>
<p>After a gust of noon wind, the miserable sounds of beggars knocking on doors fly in, a stark contrast to the above situation, forming two different types of suffering. (March 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e84">Record of Investigating Three Major Projects in Northern Henan <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>*Report from this newspaper. Contributed by Fan Shiqin*</p>
<p>Projects the Enemy Dreamed of Completing</p>
<p>The Japanese carried out three major projects in northern Henan, none of which were completed. One project, located southeast of Jiyuan, involved building canals across ten square *li*. Only one-third of this project was completed. If this project had been fully completed, the dry land around the ten square *li* of Jiyuan would have been transformed into paddy fields, wheat seedlings would have been replaced with rice seedlings, green water would have flowed constantly, and green crops would have lived forever. The majestic scenery of the north would have been combined with the delicate customs of the south. The second project was to divert the Qin River into the Grand Canal. A river channel from Qin County to Zhangcun in Boai County had already been dug, with only five sluice gates yet to be built. The enemy wanted to improve the soil in Qin County and Boai County to plant rice seedlings, and at the same time increase transportation capacity through river transport. Another project was quite grand, involving digging a 110-*li* long river channel from Wuzhi to northeast Xinxiang. Construction began in the winter of the 32nd year, and the enemy released water last year, reportedly with good results. Eighty percent of that project was still unfinished, and when fully completed, it would benefit five to six thousand *qing* of land. The enemy not only engaged in small acts of kindness, but sometimes seemed to undertake grand benevolent acts. These projects can be considered grand benevolent acts. However, the enemy's purpose was, first, to win over the hearts of the people in the short term, like building embankments in the Yellow River flood area, deliberately doing it for the people to see; but their ultimate goal was to further exploit our people. The enemy's development of northern Henan meant deepening their exploitation. Every foot dug deeper, every inch of water released, meant the people would shed an extra foot and inch of blood and sweat. Fortunately, now that we have been liberated, these projects are all in our hands, and we will complete these projects and bestow great benevolence upon our people!</p>
<p>Organizations and People Look North Eagerly</p>
<p>In towns and villages, many organizations, groups, and people heading north are lingering. Seeing those organizations, groups, and people gazing north, as if in a daze, they were overwhelmed with emotion. When you arrive in Xinxiang, there are even more organizations, groups, and people lingering than in Zhengzhou, and they return after running into obstacles, unlike those lingering in Zhengzhou who stop after seeing a sign that says "No Thoroughfare". Arriving in Anyang, there are even more organizations, groups, and people lingering than in Xinxiang, and they not only run into obstacles and turn back, but also experience life and death to get there.</p>
<p>In Anyang, there are countless commissioner's offices, and countless special commissioner's offices, and even more, I don't know how many exiled county governments. There are more than a thousand party and government workers from several counties in southern Hebei exiled in Anyang. They are now struggling to eat and clothe themselves, drifting aimlessly, with misfortune befalling them.</p>
<p>I grabbed a few party and government workers from southern Hebei and asked, "What's going on in southern Hebei?" According to them, the struggle in southern Hebei is fierce, and the sacrifices of Kuomintang members are great beyond description. Wu Te, the secretary-general of Lincheng, died heroically; Li Zhenyuan, the county magistrate of Cixian, and Wang Shaozeng, the secretary-general, died at the same time, with more than 200 comrades killed. Yang Xiaoting, the secretary-general of Feixiang, and Zheng Ganqing, the secretary-general of Guangping, jointly defended Feixiang City for 74 days. Currently, there are teams from 14 counties near Xingtai, led by party affairs supervisors Ren Xiaomin, Guo Shutang, Liu Shuyuan, and Xingtai secretary-general Yu Huai, holding high the banner of righteousness amidst the fragmented landscape. Lu Zihe, the secretary-general of Jize, is independently supporting the situation in Handan. In other counties such as Nanhe, Baixiang, Linluoguan, Chengan, and Yongnian, brave and loyal people are firmly guarding their posts. Comrade Xu Zhongqi of Linluoguan is exceptionally brave and fearless, so some call him "Xu Ironhead".</p>
<p>The Living are Destitute, the Dead are Wronged</p>
<p>Under the gloomy circumstances, the tragic struggles and heroic sacrifices of some people are rarely known. They are very unfortunate, the living are destitute, and the dead are silently wronged. In Luoyang in the past, seeing some exiled provincial governments, I felt extremely sad. This time in Anyang, meeting those loyal and brave patriots, that sad feeling resurfaced, and it felt even more unbearable. I only hope that Chinese history will quickly enter a new era of righteousness, so as to avoid this kind of unfortunate tragedy from happening again. (March 13, Jizhou)</p>
<h3 id="e85">Initial Contact with the True Face of "Treasure Island": Taiwan's Crisis Awaits Overcoming <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>*Report from this newspaper on the 16th. Contributed by Twilight, from Taipei*</p>
<p>From Southern Fujian</p>
<p>From the top of Drum Mountain in Fuzhou, at an altitude of 2,800 *chi*, we can look far across the sea to Taiwan. Separated by a strait of raging waves, the voyage is 144 nautical miles, a short distance that would only take two or three days of walking on land, but it took us a whole month to safely arrive at our destination.</p>
<p>We originally estimated that there were regular voyages from Fuzhou to Taiwan, so we took a two-day, three-night voyage to Fuzhou. Unfortunately, the powered junks bound for Taiwan had been requisitioned, sailing ships were too risky, and the China National Aviation Corporation's scheduled flights had not yet materialized. A group of more than 20 people could request a plane, but the fare would be calculated from Shanghai, which was a great blow to us. Our only belief was to wait, wait for a ship.</p>
<p>We inquired with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and the reply was that more than 2,000 people had already registered to go to Taiwan. A ship was expected at the end of the month, but whether we could squeeze into the first two batches was questionable. Fortunately, through someone's intervention, we finally bought tickets for a ship sailing on March 10th. The powered junk was managed by the Taiwan Provincial Department of Transportation and was about 96 tons. It was a wooden-hulled fishing boat that had been taken over, but it was equipped with a diesel engine, so it was called a "bang-bang boat" in colloquial speech. The entire crew was composed of Japanese prisoners of war because they only received a monthly salary of 200 yuan, which led them to collude with certain individuals to engage in smuggling and taking passengers. According to regulations, this ship could carry 80 people, but 40 people were temporarily added, and the result was that more than 200 passengers were crammed aboard. This group was not composed of government officials going to Taiwan, but rather single traders who regularly traveled back and forth. The captain and the Fuzhou China Merchants Steam Navigation Company welcomed them because the regulated fare of 12,000 yuan could be privately raised to 58,000 yuan, a staggering amount. But this added to the great suffering and mortal fear of the travelers.</p>
<p>The main discomfort was not just the heavy load, with people squeezed together like dead pigs, and no water to drink, but also the irregular sailing schedule of the ship. It wouldn't sail if the wind direction wasn't right, if the weather was bad, or if the captain was sick. The passengers had no right to ask, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ignored them. All the power was in the hands of the prisoners of war. Their poor management and embezzlement were hateful, and the lack of Chinese talent was also pitiful.</p>
<p>The ship, which was scheduled to depart on the 10th, bid farewell to the Min River on the 6th and arrived in Taiwan after four days and four nights, thanks to good fortune. The winds and waves in the Keelung Strait are unmatched in the north and south oceans. The crew constantly watched the flow of the raging waves, fearing that the bow would be swallowed by the waves. The ship's angle of inclination was often around 38 degrees, and two more degrees would mean the loss of life. When they finally stepped onto the Keelung wharf, the tired and nearly dead passengers looked at each other and celebrated their rebirth!</p>
<p>The arduous sea journey from Shanghai to Taiwan took a month, fraught with danger and shock. As I, the reporter, pen this dispatch, I still feel lingering fear in my heart!</p>
<p>Keelung Rain Scene</p>
<p>Looking at Keelung from afar on the blue sea with its surging waves, it is within sight but out of reach. After the ship enters the harbor, looking back, one doesn't know which direction the ship came from! The advantage of this military port is not only because ships of several thousand tons can directly dock at the wharf, but also because it is surrounded by high mountains with forests. The verdant green and the blue sea waves complement each other.</p>
<p>Taiwan belongs to a humid and mild zone with a very strong maritime climate. When we landed, the clothes we wore in Fuzhou didn't feel too hot, but the misty mountains, harbor, and street corners were constantly covered with light rain. We wandered through the city in the rain, starting to come into contact with the true face of Treasure Island. We stayed in the city government guesthouse, which had been converted from a hotel. It was next to the station. Opening the window, we could see the outline of Keelung Harbor. Walking around the streets with an umbrella and wearing long boots, the mud felt like the yellow plum season in southern China, humid but not refreshing. Light rain fell, and people spent long days in the rain.</p>
<p>The streets are wide asphalt roads, and people are wearing worn-out cloth clothes and wooden clogs, struggling for life. There are no large-scale stores here, only sheds built of wooden planks, opening food shops and retail stores. The scene is like refugees after a major fire. Indeed, there is not a single habitable house in the central area of Keelung City. They have all been destroyed by bombing. The streets are full of small piles of concrete, earth, and bricks. The post office building seems to maintain its past majestic appearance, but it has been covered with thousands of bullet holes. The power of the bombs has forced the transportation station and railway station along the pier to be left with a broken skeleton. The ships sunk and sunk by bombing in the harbor further reveal their wreckage. People are all looking for a way to survive in the rubble, building makeshift new homes after the bombing. On the other side of the rubble scene, we also saw thousands of Japanese expatriates waiting to be repatriated. The miserable faces of the men and women and the embarrassment of the children made people feel a surge of sympathy beyond the hatred of aggressors, believing that this is human sympathy!</p>
<p>Passing by a banana shop, I bought a catty for six yuan and four jiao in Taiwanese currency. The shopkeeper told us that everything was rising in price. Bananas used to be only three cents a catty, oranges used to be one yuan and two jiao, but now they are twelve yuan a catty. The main thing is rice, which has risen to eighteen yuan and five jiao a catty. With this unprecedented cost of living, the people not only cannot get the comfort of victory, but on the contrary, it has given them the greatest hardship, and they have begun to live on sweet potatoes and mixed grains.</p>
<p>At the station, I saw the stationmaster who had taken over. He was very eager to talk to us. He said, "I have been here for four months, and the second batch has not yet arrived. It's really lonely!" The lonely Keelung in the rain, I don't know when it can clear up and let people enjoy a little happiness of victory?</p>
<p>Taipei Stroll</p>
<p>In the past, there were many trains from Keelung to Taipei, like trams; now it is very different, with fewer trains and frequent delays, said to be because there are few locomotives and it is difficult to dispatch. We took a ticket from Keelung to Taipei for five yuan and five jiao in Taiwanese currency, and that was the end of the discussion.</p>
<p>After a short distance, we passed through three tunnels and followed the road, winding through the mountains on equal footing with the cars. The surrounding mountains are covered with tea trees, and under the coconut groves, we can smell the fragrance of bananas and osmanthus. In the plains, the ancient, purely Chinese farming methods are still appearing on this electrified and industrialized island. Farmers are using oxen to plow the fields, like the waterwheels in eastern Zhejiang scooping up spring water to irrigate the newly planted rice fields. People are returning to a normal and peaceful life in a time of peace.</p>
<p>Taipei Station, like Keelung, has been baptized by bombs. Because it was five o'clock, people were returning from the city to the suburbs, and the station was crowded with people. We walked from the station to our destination and settled down.</p>
<p>Taipei is the heart of Taiwan, the seat of the Governor-General's Office and the Provincial Government during the Japanese era. During the war, this place was also bombed and changed its face. The Governor-General's Office, the High Court, and the tall Western-style buildings in the neighborhood were all destroyed. Decades-old banyan trees, leaving their original roots, grew new branches, and in the rubble fields, people still seemed to recall the terror of being bombed and the arrogance of the Japanese before the bombing. The Provincial Government is unscathed and is now the hub for building a new Taiwan! Longgong Administration.</p>
<p>A high degree of industrialization and the Japanese's hard work have turned the island of Taiwan into a purely Japanese-style modern capital. Its original character cannot be seen not only in the appearance of the city, but also the essence of the Taiwanese seems to be detached from the tradition of the motherland, although we are everywhere where the Japanese language used to be, now it has been changed to Hokkien, and the number of women wearing cheongsams has also increased.</p>
<p>The level of education in the region is very high, and children are receiving compulsory national education, with hundreds of school units, but now most of them have been suspended because the school buildings are occupied by soldiers, and there is no way to resume classes.</p>
<p>Taihei-cho in Taipei is full of stalls selling second-hand goods, just like Qu Jiang Road in Shanghai. They are all things sold by the Japanese. Many couples are doing business together, and even men and women and children are being called to sell, in order to prepare more money to return to their conquered homeland.</p>
<p>Demolishing Houses and Selling Them Secretly</p>
<p>The people of Taiwan are now in unprecedented despair for the past 51 years. They held high hopes at the time of victory, but now they are disappointed, and they have sunk into the abyss of pessimism due to the rising cost of living, gradually losing popular support, and further affecting public security, and the abuse of power by some receiving personnel has also given the people a bad impression. Because the government cannot employ general intellectuals and young people, it has caused some serious unemployment panic, that is, those who have been re-elected, seeing the politics, cannot quickly get on the right track, and have gradually expressed passive resistance, we must point out: this is the current crisis in Taiwan Province.</p>
<p>In a period after we..., because of the panic of the Japanese, the people of Taiwan were given the opportunity to cause chaos. When the central government came, some illegal Taiwanese colluded with some corrupt workers, disrupted public security, and perverted the law for bribes. To give an example, when Japanese expatriates were repatriated back to their country, what the government received from the property of the expatriates was only immovable real estate, which could be moved had long been moved away, and recently even houses have been stolen, demolished and sold, the scene, people say is compared with Shanghai, fifty steps compared to one hundred steps, it is really regrettable!</p>
<p>The government's governance of Taiwan certainly has a set national policy, but it is worth embracing to take governing Taiwan by Taiwanese as the ultimate standard of governance. The staff going to Taiwan Province should be deeply vigilant and strive to preserve the vitality of Taiwan Province, and must not hold the distorted mentality of the conqueror.</p>
<p>Taiwan's weak "Political and Economic News" said: It is difficult for a light-industrialized and backward country to manage heavy-industrialized Taiwan, but we only hope to be able to do not to advance, and maintain the status quo, but just maintaining it, is so unbelievable that it can be done!</p>
<h3 id="e86">The New China that Concerns the British: A Lack of Full Understanding of Chinese Issues, Revealing Jealousy Towards America in Matters of Interest <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondence from London by Xueyan, Our Newspaper's 14th Day Airmail</p>
<p>When someone newly arrived from China meets British friends, they are invariably asked, "What is China like now? What is the Chinese impression of Britain?" The person being asked inevitably feels that such broad questions are difficult to answer. After residing in Britain for some time, letters from friends in China often include a sentence like, "What is the British impression of China now?" This is equally bewildering and difficult to answer. It is natural for the people of the two countries to be concerned about each other, but it is also a fact that mutual understanding is insufficient.</p>
<p>**A Flick of a Finger Can Point Out Reasons for Concern**</p>
<p>The British concern for China is self-evident. A simple flick of a finger can list more than ten reasons. For example, Britain and China were allies in this war, Britain was the first Western country to have entanglements with China, Britain was the European country with the most trade relations with China before the war... all of that goes without saying. Just take Hong Kong, India, and Burma. The British naturally consider them to be part of the British Empire. These lands are all adjacent to China and have special relationships with China. Therefore, in the eyes of the British, Britain is practically China's neighbor. Especially Hong Kong, from a historical and racial perspective, we know that Hong Kong is a Chinese world. From an administrative system perspective, the British still consider Hong Kong to be part of Britain. From this point of consideration, many related relationships arise. Chinese people traveling on the London Underground may be patted on the shoulder and asked, "Friend, can you let me know if you are from a part of China?" If you say Shanghai, the answer is: "Good place, I've been there in 19xx..." Then you can talk for a long time, even asking about the well-being of friends in China. The same situation can also be encountered in restaurants or hotels. There are quite a few British who have reached China, of course, the reason is that there were too many opportunities for former troops, warships, and merchant ships to come and go. Perhaps that's why. Many British people feel that they have a very deep relationship with China, only estranged by the war in recent years. In these years, naturally, they have heard not-so-good news about China, but because the news itself often contradicts itself, it is generally difficult to know the truth. It is only natural to ask around when encountering Chinese people.</p>
<p>**The Entire Report is Often Not Very Fair in its Stance**</p>
<p>There is no question that Britain is very concerned about China today. It is a fairly widespread phenomenon. However, the points of concern vary from person to person. There are many aspects that are not easily imagined by those of us in China. The amount of Chinese news published in British newspapers today is not that great. Most of the most important issues in China have been mentioned in British newspapers. The British Broadcasting Corporation also often has Chinese news. For example, the Political Consultative Conference, the ceasefire agreement, the reorganization of the army, and the recent Northeast problem have all been reported on the main points. People who care about the situation in China can also barely get a general idea. But unfortunately, British reporters, when reporting on Chinese events, often harbor old ideas and irresponsibly insert a sentence or two, causing the entire report to lose its fair and objective stance. For example, the Manchester Guardian recently reported on the establishment of the Sino-French agreement, when the National Army was about to hand over northern Vietnam to the French army, the reporter, when mentioning that the communique did not mention the exact date of withdrawal, suddenly added a sentence full of arbitrary atmosphere, saying, "This may be because the Chinese government is not sure whether the local garrison can obey orders." Also, when French warships bombarded Haiphong, most of the newspaper headlines read "Chinese troops bombard French warships" or "French warships were bombarded," which did not match the content. As for the news issued by our Central News Agency, saying that French warships fired first, it was quoted in quotation marks, expressing doubt. However, a few of the more left-leaning newspapers did not make such headlines, but only stated the facts, without implying any bias. Generally speaking, the attitude of British journalists towards China does not seem to be as enlightened as that of the general public.</p>
<p>**British Intelligence Department Plans to Hire Students to Write Articles**</p>
<p>From our Chinese perspective, the British press seems to not understand China enough. Conversely, Britain hopes that the Chinese people can understand them more, and they are very eager. The British Broadcasting Corporation broadcasts in Mandarin and Cantonese Chinese every day, targeting Chinese people, hoping to make the Chinese people more aware of Britain. At the same time, the British Intelligence Department has recently considered hiring a few Chinese students to help them write news about Britain, which is telegraphed to the news commissioners in the British Embassy and supplied to the newspapers for adoption. Because Chinese students select British materials, they naturally understand the Chinese psychology better, and there is a greater chance of winning agreement in China. Recently, in a China dispatch in the Daily Telegraph, it severely criticized the errors in the British propaganda method, saying that Britain's many contributions and sacrifices during the war did not make a deep impression in China, but the hardships of British domestic life and the news that Britain had to borrow from the United States were published a lot in Chinese newspapers, so that in the impression of the Chinese people, Britain is just a poor country. The Manchester Guardian recently pointed out in a Kunming dispatch that the British Information Service in China, although once closed, has been reorganized and is now issuing a large number of press releases. Chinese people who are eager to understand the world situation read the news supplied by the United States, so they have a deep impression of the United States. Therefore, this reporter advocated that Britain should also follow suit.</p>
<p>**The Seminar Reveals a Jealous Attitude Towards America**</p>
<p>It is very strange that although Britain recognizes the need to cooperate with Britain in general foreign policy, in matters of interest, the intensity of competition and jealousy is beyond what can be imagined at home. Today, many British people, when thinking of the Far East, cannot help but think of the powerful enemy, the United States, and cannot help but express indignation. Therefore, when mentioning China, they cannot help but cautiously attack the actions of the United States in China. When the reporter first arrived in Britain, by chance, he attended a seminar organized by the China Campaign. The host that night was a Labour Party member named Collag Iiam. He had been to the front line and had a considerable understanding of the Chinese issue. That night, he analyzed the issue of the Nationalists and Communists, and many of the points were insightful. Later, when talking about the attitude of the United States towards the Chinese government and the Communist Party, he attacked the United States very fiercely. The other people present also expressed the same sentiment, and their attitudes were very somber. This member of parliament later resigned in anger because he opposed the conditions agreed to by the government for loans from the United States. At that time, the reporter had just arrived in London, and although it was not difficult to infer from their arguments that they were motivated by jealousy, the depth of jealousy for Chinese affairs to such an extent was surprising to the reporter. Later, after getting along with the British for a long time, I learned that this kind of jealousy is quite common. Last year, about a hundred students came to Britain to study with Geng Kuan and British scholarships. Some of them went to factories for internships. It is said that many bosses and managers of regular factories directly asked them whether they would prefer British goods or American goods when they returned to China to purchase materials in the future.</p>
<p>**Britain Expresses Opposition to Studying in the United States**</p>
<p>Furthermore, the courses for the selection of students studying abroad in China now are all based on China's needs, which is theoretically very correct. However, before sending them to this country, they did not carefully inquire whether the schools in this country have this subject. In recent years, most of the students sent abroad by China are practicing applied science, but applied science is not recognized as advanced knowledge in many countries and is not included in graduate schools. This is the case in Britain, so many people who come to Britain to study their specialty of applied science in graduate school find that they have gone down the wrong path. Some therefore rush around, unable to find their place, some change their careers, and some do not want to change their careers and want to go to American schools, but encounter opposition. British scholarships are out of the question. Even for Geng Kuan students, it is said that British directors also oppose it and cannot fulfill their wishes. In previous sessions of the British Geng Kuan students, there were those who wanted to change to study in the United States, but none succeeded. Only in the sixth session, when Britain was heavily bombed and the students could not study with peace of mind, were they sent to Canada, but they were not allowed to go to the United States.</p>
<p>**The Atmosphere of Unease May Be Slightly Eased in the Future**</p>
<p>Speaking of the British jealousy of the American mood, I would like to mention a very interesting diplomatic event. The British and Soviets have conflicts of interest in Iran, which was already the case in the era of Imperial Russia. Later, because of the Russian Revolution, it was unable to develop outwards. Later, because of the fox kingdom revolution, there was no strength to develop in the meal, so there was a short period of Ning Jing. After this battle, the Soviet army won, and took the opportunity to seek the "foreign development" that Imperial Russia had sought. As a result, the British and Soviets competed for supremacy in Iran again, which was a matter of course. By the end of last year, because northern Iran demanded autonomy, the situation had deteriorated considerably. Just at this time, the United States proposed opening the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Rumor. Britain gladly participated, hoping that the Iranian issue could be resolved in the Three Foreign Ministers' Rumor. However, in the Rumor, it is said that although the Soviet Union did not show any concessions to the United States, it remained tough on Britain, so that Britain's original hopes could not be realized at all. For a while, British newspapers, when talking about the Iranian issue, always talked about the Soviet troops in the East Nine Provinces in the same breath, and the tone was quite somber. In the eyes of the British, the East Nine Provinces should be the location of the US-Soviet conflict, so the extent to which the Soviet army acted in the East Nine Provinces, regardless of the treaty, was only slightly less than in Iran. Britain believed that it was the Soviet Union's tone of Xuan Yu between Britain and the United States. When Iran submitted the case to the United Nations Security Council, and the Soviet Union and Ukraine also proposed requiring British troops to withdraw from Greece and the Dutch East Indies as counter-cases, British newspapers keenly felt that the Soviet Union did not simultaneously demand that American troops withdraw from China, which showed that the Soviet Union was more cautious about the United States. This attitude can often be seen in British newspapers. Well, recently, there have also been problems with the Soviet army in the East Nine Provinces, and the United States has also lodged a strong protest against the Soviet army's delay in withdrawing from northern Iran. The British sense of indignation will be slightly eased in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Hopes for the Production Sector <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— Han</p>
<p>I remember that when the government moved west to the temporary capital, Chongqing, the center of all industries also shifted to the Sichuan-Guizhou area. At that time, due to the changes in the situation and the blockade of international routes, everything presented a "different price in the morning and evening" increase, especially in the period when victory was about to come, prices rose several times! At that time, manufacturing plants were indeed facing a serious threat. Due to the instability of prices, after the products were sold, they could not get back the required raw materials, so the income and expenditure were disparate, and the losses were huge! Some manufacturers were still steadfast, struggling to support themselves, but most factories still purchased raw materials, but did not start work. Their output was still the original raw materials. They had withdrawn from the production sector and were engaged in speculative hoarding! As a result, product output decreased sharply, speculators increased, prices rose with the tide, and the people's suffering deepened day by day.</p>
<p>Now, the price fluctuations in the recovered areas are no different from those during the war; the existence of the crisis is indeed serious. The stimulation of this bad environment is enough to hinder the development of the production industry. The existing production sector should have a high degree of vigilance, seek the development of production, the improvement of production, and then stabilize prices in the extreme fluctuations of prices! In order to save the overall situation of the rise and fall of people's livelihoods, even if it means sacrificing some interests, they should strictly adhere to their posts, actively solve the entire problem, and assume the responsibilities that the production sector should fulfill. Then we can talk about how to industrialize.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Production First <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The British Efficiency Magazine once expressed the opinion that the composition of a country is industry, commerce, and agriculture, so politics actually occupies a very small part, and the government's income is also mainly based on taxes, so the news published in newspapers should also focus on the construction of industry, commerce, agriculture, etc.</p>
<p>This opinion was expressed a few years ago, but it is even more relevant to the current situation in China. Therefore, "Production First" can be said to be the most suitable slogan for the current era.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Urgently Needed Sewing Thread Raw Materials <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Liqun</p>
<p>Regardless of the type of industrial product, the selection of raw materials is an important factor in determining the quality of the product. In industrialized countries, many factories' main raw materials are self-sufficient, because they can not only reduce costs, but also obtain the quality required to match the products.</p>
<p>Taking the thread making industry as an example, the Lian Tiao brand of wood yarn, which was once popular in China, because the main raw material of cotton yarn was specially spun, so the uniformity and tensile strength of the fiber were in line with the standards of thread making.</p>
<p>The history of the development of China's thread making industry is not long, the equipment is not yet sound, and the acquisition of raw materials has always relied on the supply of yarn factories. Before the war, yarn factories specially spun cotton yarn for thread making, but now the products spun by general yarn factories are mostly needed by cloth factories and other woven products. Although there are also cotton yarns available for thread making, the tensile strength and uniformity do not meet the standards, so that the selection of raw materials for the thread making industry has encountered considerable difficulties.</p>
<p>Now that the maritime ban has been lifted, foreign goods are taking the opportunity to come in. If the raw material problem is not urgently solved, how can we compete with them? The future development of China's thread making industry will inevitably enter a major crisis. To solve this problem, in addition to the thread making industry itself working hard to find ways to solve the self-sufficiency of raw materials, it is also hoped that the yarn factory industry can specially spin and supply cotton yarn on the market according to the raw material needs and production volume of the thread making industry. Please do not ignore the importance of the thread making industry in production and construction, and cooperate with each other.</p>
<p>Although the problem of sewing thread raw materials has not yet been resolved, the Fei Lun Sewing Thread Factory will never compromise on the selection of raw materials due to difficulties. The raw materials used are specially spun by a certain yarn factory, so the quality is more improved than before, and on the other hand, it actively configures spinning equipment, hoping to achieve the ideal standard in the products.</p>
<h3 id="e90">The Seriousness of the Raw Material Problem of Handkerchief Weaving Factories - Hopes for China Textile Construction Corporation <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Siwei</p>
<p>Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the whole country has been shouting "production and construction" in unison, but due to the lack of raw materials, this slogan has not yet been officially realized. And our handkerchief weaving industry is even more suffering from such a serious problem.</p>
<p>It is found that our handkerchief weaving industry has more than 100 companies in Shanghai alone, with a total of more than 2,000 looms. If fully operational, it can produce more than 10,000 dozen per day. The raw materials used require more than 10 pieces of cotton yarn, divided into 8.9 tenths of 60 single yarns and 1.2 tenths of 84 double and triple yarns and 100 double yarns and 120 double yarns. Although cotton yarn of 84 counts or more is only needed by a few manufacturers, such as Huanqiu Factory, etc., the problem of seriousness arises with these cotton yarns of 60 counts or more.</p>
<p>Although China's national policy is to establish the country on agriculture, most of the products are inferior to those in Europe and the United States, especially the production of the main agricultural product "cotton" has been decreasing year by year after this long war, and all the products can only spin coarse yarn of 20 and 40 counts. If fine yarn of 60 counts or more is to be produced, foreign cotton must be used.</p>
<p>Shanghai, during the enemy and puppet occupation period, according to the statistics of the monthly report on imports and exports of customs, in the 29th year of the Republic of China, the handkerchiefs exported from January to June totaled 213,724 dozen, and in the 30th year of the Republic of China, from January to June, they had increased to 325,584 dozen, all sold to Hong Kong, Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines and other places. In recent years, due to the war, transportation has been blocked and has been suspended, but since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, orders have been placed in various parts of Nanyang, and if sea transportation is unimpeded in the future, the sales volume must be considerable, which can increase the input of foreign capital into the country and will also contribute to production and construction.</p>
<p>Handkerchief factory colleagues, in view of the raw material problem, is becoming increasingly serious, and there are only a very small number of 60 single yarns on the market, and the selling price of more than 60 double yarns is almost twice as high, which is due to the relationship between supply and demand, resulting in general merchants speculating and raising prices. However, the raw materials used in our industry are all single yarns, which increases the cost and of course affects production.</p>
<p>After the general meeting passed a resolution requesting the China Textile Construction Corporation to find ways to supply raw materials, representatives and the author were sent to the company to explain the seriousness of the problem in person. If the raw materials were cut off, thousands of workers would lose their jobs, which would affect society. Mr. Wu Weijing, Deputy Manager of the Company, and Mr. Jiang Xianlu, Director of the Business Department, agreed to find ways to supply them continuously.</p>
<p>Bearing the good intentions of the China Textile Construction Corporation, the 60 single yarns that had never been opened for sale were listed for sale on the 21st of this month. The selling price of each piece is 4.25 million yuan. However, we questioned the excessive price, because the same 60 double yarns only cost 2.5 million yuan, and the difference is the same as the general market. If our handkerchief colleagues use such expensive raw materials, the cost will increase, and the production and sales will be more affected, so we have to send representatives and the author to contact the China Textile Construction Corporation again. Mr. Wan Zuochen was kind enough to delay the interview. After inquiring about the reason for the price difference, it was answered that it was also due to the "relationship between supply and demand". If it is reasonable, the price of 60 single yarns should be slightly higher than that of 60 double yarns, because the procedures for spinning yarn are more complicated for double yarns than for single yarns.</p>
<p>China Textile Construction Corporation is the only state-owned commercial institution in our country, and of course it aims to support industry and commerce and develop production. Any move is enough to affect the national commerce. It is hoped that the company's authorities will use fair and reasonable prices to curb the bad habit of speculation. If it is also due to the "relationship between supply and demand" and the price also rises following the market, I think it seems to be somewhat contrary to the original intention of the founding.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Mutual Discussion on Management in General <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>(2) The Connection of the Three Major Departments</p>
<p>Production, sales, and economic management are the three important departments of general industry and commerce. To ensure that a business has a solid foundation and rapid development, these three departments must develop equally. At the same time, in addition to equal development, there needs to be a close connection. This can be illustrated with a clear analogy: managing a business is like farming. Production is like sowing seeds, sales is like harvesting, and economic management is like coordinating with the weather. Diligent sowing naturally leads to a bountiful harvest. At the same time, to have a bountiful harvest, we naturally have to diligently sow seeds. But besides these two efforts, we also require favorable weather throughout the year. Only then can growth and prosperity reach the anticipated goals. If the weather is unfavorable, such as long periods of heavy rain this month followed by a long period of drought next month, or if rain comes when it is not needed and does not come when it is needed, then the crops will suffer enormous damage. In business management, purchasing raw materials, selling goods, and daily wages are all inseparable from economics. If economic management is not properly handled, then there will be no ability to purchase raw materials when needed, and by the time the ability to purchase comes, the price will already be high. When sales are not necessary, one has to sacrifice painfully due to urgent need for funds, and when the goods are sold, the market price happens to rise, resulting in a decrease in the quantity of raw materials replenished. It can be seen that proper economic management can lead to ease and success from all directions, while improper management leads to hitting walls everywhere and failing step by step. Therefore, economic management can truly be said to be the most important key to the success of a business. And this is no different when it comes to the individual. Webster's Dictionary defines the word "Finance" (i.e., economic management) as "the science of managing property to generate profit." Since business management cannot abandon profitability, managers cannot be ignorant of this science.</p>
<p>At the same time, the connection between production and sales is also easy to explain. Before goods begin to be manufactured, the production department needs the sales department to provide reports on the general situation in the market, so that the goods produced can capture a reasonable market share. The sales department also needs the production department to provide information on all aspects of manufacturing, so as to know the advantages of the goods. If the sales department sees that the sales of goods can be expanded, then it can ask the production department to expand production. If the production department estimates that there is a way to obtain raw materials and that production can be increased, then it can ask the sales department to generate new sales channels in addition to the existing ones. In this way, through mutual cooperation, both sales and production can be confident. Add to this appropriate economic management methods, and the success of the business can naturally be assured.</p>
<p>In the past, during the War of Resistance, profits could be made simply by hoarding materials due to material shortages and currency devaluation. But this was ultimately a wartime phenomenon and not a proper way to run a business. After the victory, it is necessary to adapt to the times and develop equally in all three aspects. Because market competition is becoming increasingly fierce, good sales methods are needed not only to maintain existing business but also to expand future sales. If sales cannot be expanded, costs can never be reduced. At the beginning of construction, raw materials are not easy to purchase, the work of the production department is also quite laborious, and the turnover of funds, at a time when most manufacturers feel that capital is insufficient, requires even better management methods to make one dollar produce the effect of two dollars.</p>
<p>Thinking in broad terms, we want to get the wheels of the entire industrial and commercial sector turning. Speaking in smaller terms, we want to get the wheels of every industrial and commercial enterprise turning. The close connection and joint discussion of the three departments can be said to be the driving force behind the rotation of the industrial and commercial wheels.</p>
