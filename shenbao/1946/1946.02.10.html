<h3 id="c1">軍事三人組昨集議　會商整編具體辦法　交通停戰為討論中心 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報重慶九日電〕馬歇爾·張治中·周恩來軍事三人會議，九日晨舉行新年後之第一次會議，聞原則問題均已於會前分別交換意見，協商妥善。原則問題分二部份，一為軍隊之整編考核，使逐步實現，一為混合編制，今日所商談者，即為如何具體實施之辦法，其中心在恢復交通及北平執行總部與各執行小組完成之衝突調處事宜，謀取雙方協定，將來交通恢復之後，各交通綫槪交與民用，不准再作軍用。白魯德上校之來，即為向馬歇爾特使報吿北平執行總部及各地區調處衝突經過及請示未決事項者。三人於此次會後，聞將至各停戰地區視察，完畢後即赴北平。</p>
<p>〔本報北平八日電〕調處勢利部之工作，頃在山東，赤峯與交通問題上，業已遭遇重大礁石。（一）共軍認山東泰安·張店兩地守軍為偽軍，不准予以糧食接濟。昨日由濟南運泰安之糧食一列車，被共軍領導下之人民搶去，執行部今日已增派一小組前往解決此事件，並已向蔣主席請示。官方謂，泰安·張店守軍係政府之保安隊，並非偽軍。蓋事實上彼等會在抗戰期間，作艱苦之奮鬥也。（二）赤峯保安隊係中共領導下之隊伍，依照執行部上月廿七日之命令，應行退出該參加管理與警衛，其範圍不以大江以北為限，而江南亦在其內。政府方面則認為全國路政必須由交通部統一管理。現時尚在僵持中。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶九日電〕馬歇爾·張治中及周恩來組成之三人會議，九日晨十時舉行，至下午二時始畢，由平來渝之軍事調處執行部執行組長白魯德少將亦參加，對各項問題商討至詳，據聞已獲若干協議。</p>
<h3 id="c2">部隊不論是否稱偽軍　須一律遵命停戰　調處執行部發表臨時指令 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社北平九日電〕軍事調處執行部新聞發布組，九日發表第九號聯合公吿，北平二月九日，軍事調處執行部所面臨之困難而嚴重之竟是，已於發出一臨時指令後迎刃而解，該令係致各執行小組政府及中共各部隊長官者，其中規定所有部隊不論是否稱為偽軍，均應包換在停戰令範圍之內，此項命令經調執部各執行科長一再商議後始完成，昨日復經三委員批准致各執行小組各部隊長及重慶之電文，原文如下：所有部隊，不論是否稱為偽軍，如係政府軍或中共國所承認者，均屬於停戰命令範圍之內，此種部隊及其對峙之部隊，應保持一月十三日二十四時之位置，或於必要時保持由執行小組所決定之位置，此為臨時辦法。有關部隊地位之諸問題，將俟三人委員會最後決定之。此項在全面停戰命令內包括上述部隊之規定，對各地問題之解決，將能有實際之幫助，尤其對於山東，江蘇及河南為然，因該數區內上述部隊對於政府及中共軍事長官間成立協議時，成為一種頗為嚴重之障礙。調執部委員會主席羅柏遜，今日向提及該項協議之各執行科官長之合作精神深表贊揚，並稱：中共執行科科長宋時論少將及政府執行科科長周勱武少將，在決定此項問題時之合作精神，應受最高之表揚，彼等與伊體中校不斷商議，而得之協定，對於完成執行部使命，將有大幫助。此間政府及中共代表再度表示彼等之誠意及決心，實行重慶三人會議之協議。</p>
<p>〔合眾社重慶九日電〕共產黨發言人稱：共產黨對恢復交通問題不擬讓步，但渠相信泰安危機並不嚴重，日內即可解決。又稱：共產黨允許日偽軍隊通過共軍佔領區域，但此等軍隊必先解除武裝。又稱：泰安偽軍解除武裝以後，共軍願自該處退出，以示並無佔領該城之意。關於解除偽軍武裝問題，共產黨願遵從三人委員會之決議，倘三人委員會決議由共軍解除偽軍武裝，則共軍將同時接收泰安城，但如三人委員會贊成由三方面共同行動，則由美方，政府及共產黨派遣代表接收該城。</p>

<p>〔中央社北平九日電〕軍調執部濟南小組政府代表凃敘五，中共代表陳叔亮及美方代表雷克上校，今最謁葉劍英，報吿小組在魯工作情形，並就魯省偽軍問題，有所商討。</p>
<p>〔中央社濟南九日電〕濟南小組以泰安情勢緊張，對解圍撤防意見未能一致，執行小組會三次前往調處，迄無結果，雷克上校業將經過情形詳電北平報吿，執行部已有覆電到濟，將再派泰安執行小組專負該地執行調處工作，雷克上校特於八日下午一時，偕同雙方代表及中共山東軍區武治部主任，　中軍區副司令　任農乘機飛平，與執行部負責人及泰安執行小組奈普中校等會商解決魯省一切困難，一俟獲得協議，即與泰安小組同返魯工作。又濟南小組，以濟市煤炭缺乏，已與中共代表商妥，允由淄博礦區運煤來濟，省當局已派員前往起　濟市煤荒可望解決。</p>

<p>〔本報北平八日電〕目前各地雖已無事衝突，但若干人士對和平前途仍頗悲觀。某負責當局語記者，停戰令生效後，共產軍不斷向鐵路綫移動，形成包圍態勢，國軍若干據點已陷於孤立，在此種狀態下，停戰令似僅為對國軍之一種約束力，而對共產軍則否。綜計一月十四日停戰令生效起，至念四日止之十一日中，被共軍攻佔之縣城有十一處，車站廿七處，村鎭八處，其地名及攻佔日期如下：（一）河南孟縣（一月十九日），（二）察哈爾集寧（十八日），（三）山東淄川及其附近礦區（十四日）（四）江蘇新克鎭（十八日），（五）河北玉田（十四日），（六）江蘇朋浦葆站（十八日），（七）江蘇牛山車站（十八日），（八）江蘇阿湖車站（十八日），（九）江蘇徐塘車站（十八日），（十）山東嗒耳埠車站（十六日），（十一）山東龍山車站（十九日），（十二）山西渾縣（十八日），（十三）山東金嶺鎭（十九日），（十四）山東棗園寺（十七日），（十五）山東普集（十七日），（十六）山東大臨池車站（十九日），（十七）河北安次縣（十七日），（十八）河北文安黨頭　（十九日），（十九）河北東光以南運鎭（十五日），（二十）羅山周黨畋（十五日），（二一）泰安車站（十五日），（二二）山東界首（十五日），（二三）山東萬德車站（十六日），（二四）山東博山東博山（十五日），（二五）河北豐澗縣（廿四日），（二六）遼南營口鎭（十四日），（二七）天義站（十九日），（二八）晋南浮山（十七日），（二九）晋南冀城（十八日），（三十）晉北孤岐（十七日），（三一）晉北麻會鎭（十五日），（三二）晉北高陽鎭（十六日），（三三）鄂北雷典店，下巡店，桑樹店（十四日），（三四）定遠店（十六日），（三五）潘新店（十六日），（三六）丈嶺（十六日），（三七）太保荘（十六日），（三八）益都車站（十九日），（三九）淄河店（十四日），（四十）運河（十四日），（四一）八義集（十四日），（四二）大徘（十四日），（四三）趙敦（十四日），（四四）瓦　（十四日）。</p>

<p>— 蒼龍</p>
<p>中央通訊社東京特派員宋德和先生，幾天前從東京翩然飛到上海，他腦海裹帶來了一幅屈膝後「落日帝國」的即景。記者懷着迫切的心緒，想把他這幅嶄新的即景，依樣畫葫蘆一下，以公諸同好。</p>
<p>宋先生自頂至踵，整副美國隨軍記者式的裝束，謙和地說：看到的東西太多了，不知話從何起。他點着一根紙菸，從煙霧的繚繞中，縷述着日本的片段。</p>
<p>他首先提出了當前日本最現實的難題，那就是日本的吃和穿都沒有着落，所以一般的即景，脫離不了一個「苦」字。許多大城市炸毁的程度很嚴重，於是住也發生問題。</p>
<p>日本的政體，軍閥和財閥的機構，隨着這次的屈膝，整個兒的瓦解了。今年三月底，經過大選後，日本的政體，可說有初步的成就，至於以後所趨的途徑，那要看他們政治領袖的思想如何而定奪了。日本人民現在已賦予很大的自由，可是大部的人民，都不會利用自由，幾百年來傳統思想的束縛，使日本人民的一舉一動，唯政府的命令是從。他說這種思想是亟待改造的。</p>
<p>目前在日本活　的政黨較著名的有共和黨，社會黨，進步黨，自由黨等等，後述的兩個黨是由從前的老黨改組而成。最近共和黨跟社會黨有很熾烈的競爭，看樣子社會黨似乎已佔了優勢，力量也比較大，據說這個黨是合併戰前三個小黨而成的。</p>
<p>日本的運氣可說很不錯，因為麥帥對他們的一切，是再公道也沒有了！目前日本的財政問題很感困難，雖說盟軍佔領日本的費用，須由日本供給，可是這種佔領費用的支出，每月不過十四萬萬元左右，尚不及日本作戰時期每月軍費支出十分之一。所以照日本人的算法，可望在六年內，將其本國的內債淸償。至於對外賠償，據說因為問題太複雜了，還待研究。　因為缺少絲，棉，毛等種種原料，九州和北海道兩地的煤，又因兩地的工人不願工作而沒着落，所以日本大部的工廠，都沒法生產，機件呆擱，烟囪表冒不出煆來。</p>
<p>記者不禁問起他日僑回國後的情形。他說：日僑回國，首先就要遭到住的難題，撇開吃和穿的問題不談，回國後的職業問題，也沒法解次，現在雖然還有配給制度，不過因為東西的貧乏，配給量只有以前的一半，稍為有錢的人，都取給於黑市，黑市裏條五寸長的小魚，要賣到十多日元，合計美金六角多；米的市價，黑市比官價高出三十二倍，大城市裏的居民，無不受着嚴重的威脅，而鄉村裹的人，因為有生產的關係，比較上好的多了。</p>
<p>因此在日本發生了一個很怪的現象，城市裘的人，找職業固然困難，可是大家又都不願找職業。例如：東京失業的人有七十多萬，當時有幾家工廠須要三萬多人，結果沒人去。工廠的工錢，每天不過十幾塊日元，只够買一條黑市裘的五寸小魚，結果這些人都跑到鄉村裘去，販了許多蘿蔔、靑菜、米糧之類，拿到城市裏向黑市發賣，賺的錢還勉可糊口。我告訴他上海在敵偽盤踞期間，也盛行着這種「單帮」生意，滋味如何，現在是輪到日本人嘗試的時候了！</p>
<p>宋先生又說：在日本的人民，對他們不死歸來的「皇軍」，感到很不痛快，當初一味給軍閥們朦蔽在悶葫蘆裹，成天陶醉在「大東亞」的高調裏，聰着「皇軍」的赫赫的戰跡，等到屈膝消息宣佈，才知道過去所聽到的一切，都是鏡花水月。他們當初强顏歡笑的送着「皇軍」，一批批的出去遠征侵略，現在却埀頭喪氣，拿着反感的情緒迎　他們的歸來，這正暴露了日本人民受騙後的心理，是何等的沉鬱痛苦！</p>

<p>— 本報專稿　朱民威自新疆歸來後作</p>
<p>記者於抗戰勝利後奉航委會政治部簡主任之命，赴新公幹，逗留新疆時間雖不多，但由於與各方面人士接觸頗多，爰再就自己見聞中所獲印象，提出若干問題，或足為讀者參考之一助。</p>
<p>新疆是一個邊省，且境內又有若干萬哈薩克在鬧，無疑的，用兵已是一年以來的事實。這一年來，政府報用之兵，如內地開去的步兵，這些部隊，從精河前綫一直到哈密，沿綫各地都駐紮着。截至上年九月止，他們依然是舊編制，舊裝備，舊給養。（與陳誠部長的整軍後的新制有別。）</p>
<h3 id="c44">新省國軍部隊　要適應沙漠地區特性 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>當然，在勝利以前，為了應付對日戰爭，無法派遣精銳部隊來新省駐防。但新省為我國重要門戶，其現實價値雖不如東北，但未來前途，可供華族若十萬人若千萬年之久違生息。旣爲大門，你派內衛，穿得襤褸，吃得不飽，遽而作戰，呌人看了也無好感。何况在新疆窮漠大野，要對付出沒不定的哈薩克馬隊呢？</p>
<p>在作戰方式上，政府部隊來新一年，大小各役，都是防禦綫或點的守勢戰。而對方總是襲擊或進攻，這種作戰方式，根據整個國策來說是對的，因為政府無意於戰爭，更沒有消滅哈薩克的企圖，只有為了保衛各族利益，安定生活，擁護政府主權，才在哈蕯克騷擾區駐紥其必要的部隊。　由於作戰方式以及新疆寒帶沙漠地區特性，記者認為左列諸點値得重視：</p>
<p>駐新部隊旣為防護性，而無攻擊意味，數量就不必多，太多了部隊，裝備·給養·駐地·遝輸，均會發生問題，不能發生防哈族作用，倒反而會使民間產生過重的負擔。</p>
<p>已經開進新省的部隊，要立刻實施新編制，配給新裝備，特別要針對寒帶沙漠地區的嚴寒風雪，要使每個兵·馬·汽車都要能適應該地氣候，更要給予新給養，使得一個兵就是一個健壯的精兵。</p>
<p>長期駐兵的各據點，如各縣城以及交通綫上重要點，均應發動兵工建築足够派駐部隊之營房，要把我們中國隊伍到那兒就駐民房的早年習慣改過來，若是官兵生活改過，吃飽穿暖，不打仗時，（防禦性的駐防·作戰時間很少。）做工造營房，以免擾及民居，這是最能給予邊省各宗族好感的必要行為。</p>
<h3 id="c45">兵馬飽暖精銳　緊急局勢可能轉鬆弛 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>以上各點能够辦到的話，我相信政府方面決不會有所損失，而官兵可以飽暖，用兵之區的各族人民可以安居，剩下來的是精銳兵馬便可對抗孤立的哈薩克而新省軍事形勢，也就不致嚴重到實行迪化保衛戰的狀態了。過去迪化一度緊急情勢，曾因張治中部長赴新談判而轉鬆，但最近汝此後的發展如何，仍未易逆料，且亦未許樂觀。</p>
<p>軍事問題大半解決後，進行行政上各種措施，便獲餘裕。吳主席在與記者接談時，曾表示新疆並沒有嚴重的宗族鬥爭現象，這事可於以下各例見到：除漢族自願服兵役外，新省府已停止徵兵，因此，在新各族均無兵役負担。經濟方而，政府總是做嘉惠於民之事，捐稅均不重。各族均在各自經濟活動上求自由發展，無暇亦不願鬧宗族間衝突鬥爭。因為新疆地廣人稀，家畜豐盛，草木繁茂，糧食，棉花，水菓，蠶絲，羊毛，鹽巴，林木，足够新疆各宗族四百萬人口生活之資。漢人雖非土著，幾十年來與維族蒙族等相處，也從未因種族經濟宗敎等起過衝突，這一年來哈薩克的騷擾，祇是由於哈族有史以來即有搶奪習慣，看到別人弱，他就逞强，繼之以搶奪，若再加以別的因素，就很容易作亂。政府有一支小而精銳的部隊來控制他們以後，就沒有什麼大亂子，因此，對整個新疆的行政實施，就轉到一個問題上來：到底我政府將於新疆取利呢？還是我政府為了保存國土完整而貼補新疆？</p>
<h3 id="c46">從事開化工作　忍受苦担而爭取甘果 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>就記者在新見聞所及，中央政府目前派到新疆來的人是：部隊，政府機關公務員，以及技術人員，醫藥人員，教員等，此外，政府在新發行了新疆單獨流通的新省幣。（新省幣一元，合法幣五元。）</p>
<p>政府憑著他的權力與信用引使紙幣，由紙幣換來新省人民的產生，供應來新的軍政教技術人員生活，這些在新人員，再轉而從事新疆開化工作，以使新省人民及國家受惠。若說是國家在新省的作為，可以得到收益，那只有說為國家保存了中國所有的這份土地。但這件事若要全部做好，要待中央以全力來做，僅交給來新人員是辦不了的。</p>
<p>為新省人民造福，目前新省建敎工作已有一些成就，但也還有待國家拿出新的力量來灌溉。我們有新疆這塊土地，是國家一個負擔，在眼面前雖是不大有利的土地，在日後中國的全面發展上是有很大助力的。因此，我認為即使此刻國家在復員方面處處艱苦，浩費重大，但對新疆仍不可中斷貼補政策。</p>
<p>貼補政策的執行，必需忍受限前的負累，求取未來的成就。</p>
<h3 id="c47">遴選赴新　避免人材向東流現象 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>在目前人的方面，中央派新人一員，要遴選優秀的幹才，去一個人，就得給一份溫暖給各宗族，使之向內，對於新省建設敎育所需人材，要源源供應，不要有復員時全部人材向東流的畸形現</p>
<p>物質方面，要盡量滿足新疆建設期中物資的需要，像新省新豐紗廠的四百多噸機器，要設法運來，要源源根據新省人民對內地物資的需要，把茶葉，糖，布疋運送進來。這兒姑舉一例，以槪其餘。</p>
<p>交通方面，在鐵路造成以前，政府要實行廉價行駛汽車，來聯繫新省與內地交通，鐵路愈速向西行愈好。</p>
<p>在中蘇協定業已簽定的現在，要儘量取得蘇聯對新疆建設的協助，即使予對方以互惠之大利，亦不必吝惜。</p>
<h3 id="c48">促進各族內向　全會凝溶於我國版圖 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>新疆之行，如一個夢，我現在想到的只有以上所述各點，剩下一個問題，即為使各宗族內向的問題。倘若上述軍事行政方面能够做到一部份，各宗族原本也只要求生活的安定，經濟文化生活的漸漸提高，政府能做到上述各點，即可使各宗族內向了。再著手把內地的電影，話劇，科學，敎育，現代科學生活方式，逐一對新疆輸入，加上保持並發揚各宗族語言文字與文化，內地大學與各種公共事業，（如鐵路，公路等，）吸收新省各宗族靑年受敎，學習，這都是使新省各族人士內向的辦法，持之以恒，自可產生良好的成果。如此，新疆完全凝溶於中國版圖之內，當即指日可待。（卅五年二月初於滬）</p>

<h3 id="c50">利用過剩牛乳 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>捐助供給一部分小學兒童主筆先生：</p>
<p>最近與幾位朋友閒談，得到一個驚奇的新聞，就是上海市裹牛奶棚所每日生產的三萬餘磅牛乳，竟有一部分過剩下來而找不到出路。本來，以上海人口超過五百萬的都市，說是社有三萬餘磅牛乳的供應量，已經是渺小得很。而此渺小的供應量，想不到還有過剩而找不到出路，的確使我聞之而驚奇的。有人說，一般人民生活水準，尚未能到達可以喝牛乳的地步，這個經濟問題，確是存在着。還有人說，吾國人民沒有喝牛乳的習慣。更有人說，就是有錢而能喝得起牛乳的人，却有很多的，還相信廣播裏的補藥宣傳，根本上尚未能確實明瞭牛乳的好處，這是人民對於一般營養常識的缺乏。凡此情形，都是使得牛乳所以過剩的重要因素。筆者此刻寫這短文，並不是想要解決種種形成此牛乳過剩的原由，而是要利用此過剩牛乳尋覓一個適當的有用的出路。</p>
<p>這也是最近的事，就是在某一天的申報裏論裹，讀到一篇文章，「極重要而被疏忽的一羣—淸寒學生的營養問題。」我是深深地被這篇文章所感動。因為以我是醫師的立場說，費了不少年心血敎育出來的人才，假使是身體依然弱不禁風的東亞病夫，這在國家是不可彌補的損失，而在民族健康方面講起來，是一個急切需要來補救的嚴重問題。同時又回想到去年重慶的大公報裏，陳衡哲先生有一篇「救救吾們下一代的國民」（標題大的如此，因原文不在手邊）的論文，我當時也是十二萬分的同情。我相信凡是閱讀過這篇文章的，一定也很同情的。可是同情有什麼用！文字的鼓吹，不過是開始實際作的第一步，而最重要的需要，吾們必須在文字鼓吹以後，緊跟着的是要有計劃有步驟的行動。</p>
<p>在從前，申新兩報上，募集助學金的運動，是很能受到許多人的重視，因而募集了不少款項，使得淸寒學子，可以繼續他的學業。最近不是還有募集貸學金助學金底運動麼？因此，我想要解決今日牛乳過剩而找不到出路的現實問題，似乎也可以仿照貸學金助學金募集的方法，為解次此問題中間的一個辦法。</p>
<p>進行此辦法的第一步驟，是要發起一種募款購買市場上過剩牛乳的運動。牛奶棚的主人，應該規定一個僅够成本的價格，募集方法，一個人可以經常每月祖負每日購十磅或以上的經費，或者不以磅計，捐助一筆款項亦可。總之，是盼望同情此運動的人，捐助款項，不計多少，以能盡量購買此降到最低成本之過剩牛乳。</p>
<p>第二步驟是利用此過剩牛乳，免費給與一部分必需飲用牛乳之小學兒童。所謂一部分者，是指經過體格檢查後，發見營養不良及其他有須給與牛乳必要的兒童而言；同時，在開始辦理時，應該先就淸寒家庭裘出來的兒童辦起。此種免費給與牛乳的辦法，在此次大戰期間，英國就行之於婦嬰及一般兒童。至經常辦理的，如歐美公共衛生機關或小學校，原是很普遍的，吾國戰前在南京市一度也曾有給予豆漿的辦法。免費給與牛乳，還未曾實行過。依此兩個步驟，因而我有幾個簡要的辦法：</p>
<p>（1）利用此過剩牛乳，與以適當的應用，應由地方同情及熱心人士開展宣傳運動，如用廣播，電影場裹的廣告，及各大報特闢專欄，為文提倡等等。</p>
<p>（2）仿照貸學金募集辦法，委託銀行或由報館代為教集，為一部分小學兒童給與免費牛乳之補助金，並由同情及熱心人士中組織一委員會，管理其事。</p>
<p>（3）由地方健康敎育委員會（地方衛生及敎育主管部門所成一立之機構）派員（醫師護士）檢查當地小學兒童體格，以此檢查結果，為給與免費牛乳之惟一根據。</p>
<p>（4）與牛乳業公會商定最低成本價格，並接洽如何以此上海市所過剩之牛乳（假定尚有餘剩的話）運送到其他較大城市如沿京滬錢之吳縣，無錫，武進，鎭江等地。</p>
<p>（5）此過剩之牛乳必須經常由地方衛生機關與以抽查檢騐，（因類不合格牛乳的有害，為吾人所習知，）同時嚴格管理牛奶棚，實甚重要，因為也許有極少數的牛奶棚還是不夠水凖的。</p>
<p>此外，技術方面有待商討的，自然還有若干小問題，留待同情及熱心此運動的人士來研究。筆者不過先將本人所想到的，提出來作一個建議，希望申報倡導，更望社會明達之士，不吝賜教。</p>

<p>— 駱克德教授作</p>
<p>不知有多少人曾問我：「你什麼時候去遊月宮？「一切新發明如船隻　搬之類，在沒有問世以前，世人都　笑說：不可能。可不是嗎？五十年前，誰相信飛行是可能的？連權威方面的一般人士都說：飛行沒有什麼軍事重要性。十九世紀中的醫生，還在說每小時六十哩的速度，對於人類的心是一種致命傷，二十五年前有多少人能相信，有一天人能坐在渡洋　中在大西洋中央舒舒服服的看到自己的家還同家人談話？</p>
<p>英國遊星社</p>
<p>的組織計劃目的，世人誠難置信，五十年後我們還可不依賴今日世界所用的燃料嗎？燃料，的確是我們最大的問題。這不但是個遊月社，且是個火箭社，要試騐出這火箭厦理在「正常」的太空旅行上，將來究竟能給人類生活多大的影響。</p>
<p>德國也有遊星社，十五年來受政府有力的支持，社員是星象學，航空術，化學，物理學，無綫電學，各界富有科學思想之領袖。英國遊星社成立於一九三三年，由少數科學家，不少醫生，冒險家，數理家組成。</p>
<p>直到戰爭爆發時止，遊星社研究的主題，是如何置辦一交通工具合於科學旅行的條件，而到達月球表面。戰爭期間遊　社不很活動，現在它的主要工作，仍舊是研究並分析初期的結果，英國飛</p>
<p>火箭的試驗</p>
<p>結果，英國飛向外特島的火箭回來時，不及落地就爆炸，證明燃料的不適當。為着火箭燃料，不知已經做過多少次實騐了。液體氣到最近纔許作商用，或將給人發明許多新式爆炸物的綫索，說不定在高速度旅行上，會造成新紀元，亦未可知。</p>
<p>用火箭，是現代一大發明，比較上雖不算大馬力已大到數千，儲備數千噸燃料問題，已够複雜，一隻克服太空的飛船，豈不要燃料數百萬噸？可是，初步試騐只能用較小火箭，還要帶着信號，使地球上的人能看到。液體燃料不但簡化，載人火箭的控制，且能增加火箭脫離地心吸力範圍的速度。高速度所以必要，一則克服冥其無邊際的太空，二則火箭賴高速溫度上，纔能保持效率。</p>
<p>第一個具備技術的論證與常識，想</p>
<p>作太空旅行</p>
<p>的人，是俄國人謝爾考斯基。早在一九〇三年，他就懷着這種意念，一九一四年美國葛達特博士出版他有名的著作，創導以最高度火箭作太空之技術偵察。可見太空旅行的觀念，早已萌生，遊星研究，自此便成為一種更富於正確性的科學，德美法科學家，曾悉心從事於研究工作。</p>
<p>要在月球上準備幾個月的糧食，空氣，和娛樂，目前看上去，絕不可能。據說一個成功的太空飛船，每秒鐘應達七哩的速率。人要在月球上生活，眞不容易。因為氣壓過低，茶必須放在堅固金屬器裹煮沸，立刻飲掉，吾則立刻變冷。月球上沒有樹木，床只是一塊三合土。總之，在一九四六年年初，我們還覺得遊月宮只是一個幻夢。可是將來，總有一天動身去月宮的人，說：啊！這一定是件最好壯遊！（英譯）</p>

<h3 id="c52">原子能之經濟價值 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— 趙曾整</p>
<p>本報為提倡舉世注目之「原子能」問題研究起見，特請趙曾珏先生以深入淺出之文宇，撰述上項問題之專論，分期刊載，業已於上年十二月九日本年一月十三日在本報先後發表，此係共第三篇。以後當陸續刊登星期論壇，以引起大衆研討之興趣。（編者）</p>
<p>一　原子能計算的基本定理</p>
<p>如其說第一次世界大戰為化學戰爭，無疑地第二次世界大戰可稱為物理戰爭。我們譚化學的時候，知道每一種單純元素，分到最後不能冉分的一個單位就是「原于。」世界上所有的元素，一共有九十二種。孟登利夫按各種原子的重量和性質，排成一個週期表，發現這些元素有天然的序位，規律的化學性。要形容一個原子，除了它的名字以外，還有兩個數目很重要，一個是它的比較重量，呌做「原子量」，還有一個在週期表按着次序排起來，呌做「原子序數」。原子有九十二個，有了這兩個數目，就可確定某一個了。好比有了「體重」，有了「序齒」，不難斷定那一位哥哥或弟弟。在這九十二位兄弟中，體格最重的老大哥是鈾，它的原子量是二三八，它的序數是九十二。其他的弟弟，序數愈低，體重亦愈輕。這九十二兄弟，各有各的個性。十九世紀的未葉，證明一個原子的構成，是由於核心的外圍，環繞着電子，在核心典外圍電子之間，充滿着空間，好像行星繞着太陽造成太陽系一樣。圍繞着核心的電子數目，等於「原子序數」，所以氫的外圍電子祇有一個，鈾的外圍電子有九十二個。我們稱氫的序數是一，鈾的序數是九十一。這種圍繞核心的電子，供應一切化學作用，如煤的燃燒，火藥的爆炸，都係化學性的表現。</p>
<p>現在所稱的原子能，實在是「原子核心能」，而不是表面的電子能。這種「原子核心能」，共猛無比，藏伏於核心之中，非將核心打破，不輕易放出，乃是物理性的表現。我們主要問題，要研究原子核心，到底是什麼，怎樣可以打破？其實一個原子的全部重量，都集中在很小的範圍—核心—以內。核心裏包含着「質子」及「中子」，異常堅密地相互結合。質子帶着陽電，以與外圍帶着陰電的電子相抵消。中子不帶任何電荷，完全是中和性的，其重量與質子相彷。因為中子不帶電，所以最難控制，不受原子核電塲的影響，是人們最後發見的。我　如用它來作攻擊原子核的武器，眞如入無人之境，它就是原子炸彈成功的主要角色！可是中子不能天然供給，非從原子核心分化，不能取得，這又增加我們的困難。但是自從中子出現，確立了原子核的新觀念。拿鈾來說吧，鈾的核心包含着九十二個質子，一百四十六個中子，重量二百三十八，帶電九十二。</p>
<p>中子的研究，引起了無數科學家的注意。物理學家發見速度較低的中子，反而比高速度中子來得有用，因為高速度中子，很快地穿過了物質，也許不發生作用，但是低速度中子徘徊逗遛其間，常常會發生物質的蛻變。這個緣故很容易了解，譬如一顆速率很高的槍彈，穿過人體的皮肉，反而不若一顆速率低的槍彈，在皮肉裏盤旋的厲害。利用低速中子去打擊原子核，會發生分裂的現象，是造成原子炸彈的另一主因。原子能的利用，是以物理的方法，將原子核打破，使其中藴藏的「能量」供我人的運用。在打破某種物質的原子核時，必需選擇被打的物質及新方法與新武器，換言之，打破原子核的武器最好是速度較低的「中子」，被打的物質最好是不穩定的元素。鈾族元素是出名不穩定的元素，久為科學家認為可以利用的東西。</p>
<p>可是根據物質不滅及能量不滅的兩定例，我們何以能憑空製造大量的「能」呢？遠在一九〇五年，愛因斯坦研究相對論的結果，用數學方式證明，物質與能量，可以互相轉變。道種轉變的證實，可從放射物體中見之，並且證明放射能量，等於質量單位乘光速平方之積。如一公斤的物質，全部變為能量，可得二百五十億度電量，或二十一萬五千億卡的熱量。這種驚人的數字，說明物質實在是「能」之源。物質轉變為能的一個問題，以前不為人們所注意，但在最近的十五年中，漸漸被科學家以精密的儀器，觀察試騐而證實。一由於精微儀器的發明，一由於原子物理學的進步。原來自然界的九十二種元素，包括二百五十種同位素，都是穩定的，不容易將核心打開。所以要搜求或製造核心易於打開的新元素，然後我們可以獲得原子能。綜上所述，原子能取之不易，要高强的技術，花費鉅額的資金。其經濟價値，不可不作精密研討。</p>
<p>二　原子能在戰時的價值</p>
<p>研究放射性物質時，我不不得不研究鈾族，因為　的產量比較豐富，約一百萬倍於鐳。鈾有U-238,U-235,U-234等同位素。在普通天然鈾中，U-238的佔百分之九九·七，U-235約佔百分之〇·三，U-234極少。這三種　族同位素中，第一種可稱為普通鈾，產量較第二種多一百倍，第二種可稱爲中鈾（U235）比較不穩定，其核心比較容易擊破，是爆炸的來源，它爆炸的機會，比較普通鈾多一百八十倍，所以合於做原子炸彈之用。在一九四〇年二月，明尼蘇達大學尼爾敎授，用質譜儀，利用它們不同的重量，將U238和U235來分開，另外也可以用氣化的方法，將U235從U238分離，終於純粹的中鈾是提煉成功。用這種中鈾製造的炸彈，也許就是投擲於日本廣島的一種，比較成本貴的！</p>
<p>但是科學家還要研究，比較便宜及機會較多的新物質，所以鐠（Plutonim）又由試騐而成為大規模製品.以前我曾提到物理學家用中子去打鈾，希望發現鈾屬以外的原子，結果果然有兩個元素，第一種是普通鈾把外來的中子吸收，變成一個序位九十三號新的元素，就是海王元素（Neptunium），它的核心包含九十二個質子，一百四十七個中子，可是它太不穩定，可說是普通鈾變成鐠的中間物。不久放出兩個電子，核心變為九十四個質子，一百四十五個中子，而變成鐠，或稱為海后元素（Plutonium）。這個第九十四號元素—鐠Pu239—可用化學方法與鈾238分離，而受單獨處理，因為它的化學性已經和普通鈾不同了。這一個元素遇見外來的中子，就發生分裂現象，可以爆炸而生連鎖反應，—正是宇宙的大花爆！新元素—鐠—製造時因為可以利用比較豐富的普通鈾，在機會上比較上段所述提煉中鈾的辦法，已增多了一百四十倍，並可用化學方法分離，所以比較經濟。用這種新元素製成的原子炸彈，比較成本低一點，也許就是投在長崎的那一顆炸彈！</p>
<p>截至現在止，美國自一九四〇年起，集合無數科學家研究，可以利用原子能的主要物質，歸納起來，正式公佈的，不過上述的兩種。一種是中鈾（U-235），一種是（Pu-239）。在美國物資充沛，人才輩出的環境，加速進行，共費五年之久，耗資二十億至三十億美金。如不在戰時，不為爭取最後的勝利，決不會如此之速的成功。而最有趣的，據我們所知，實在應用到的原子炸彈不過三顆，第一顆於一九四五年七月十六日首次在新墨西哥洲試騐，第二顆於八月六日投於日本廣島，第三顆於八月十日投於日本長崎。嗣後於八月十二日，日本就無條件的宣佈投降了。此後美國有否繼續製造原子彈，目前無從探悉，但無論如何，實在幫助我們結束這次世界大戰的是這三顆原子彈。假定以全部的研究及製造費用，分攤在這三顆原予彈身上，每顆約耗十億美金，而結束了此次世界空前的大屠殺。则每顆十億美元的原子彈的價値，遠超出它所費的金錢代價！無論如何，值得我們花費的。所以在戰時原子能的價值是無疑義的。</p>
<p>三　原子能在平時的經濟價值</p>
<p>其次，我們要檢討原子能在平時的經濟價値在檢討之先，我們對於運用原子能時，下列數點不能不加考慮：（一）原子能放射性的危險：（二）隔離放射設備之重量與價値；（三）可能爆炸的危險；（四）原子能原料—鈾—可能的缺乏，不能繼續供應；（五）政府對於原子能資源的嚴格控制。凡此種種，假使都能解除，我們應用中鈾（U235），可以兩種不同的方式：一為應用普通精煉的中鈾，須配備較大的鈾堆，一為應用精煉度較商的中鈾，配備較為經濟的鈾堆，以產生需要的熱能，供工業上的應用。所謂精煉的度數，即原料內所含中鈾成分的高低，通常在工業上合理的中鈾含量可自百分之一至十五。現在不妨假定用含百分之十的中鈾，為工業上應用原子能之標準原料。當原子能應用之時，第一步即為熱力之利用，此種產生於原子能之熱力，可傳之於水、空氣、或其他流體，以推動內燃式之渦輪或蒸汽渦輪，以轉動發電機或飛機。將來或以原子能作為飛彈之原動力，均係理想中最簡捷之運用範圍。</p>
<p>更進一層，要得到原子能在平時的經濟比値，最好的辦法，須將每磅原子能原料可能產生的「能」，與產生同量能的煤價或汽油價，作一個簡章的比較。我們買煤，買汽油，不是為煤或汽油，而是為「能」。我們提煉中鈾或鐠，也不是為中鈾或鐠，而是為「能」。所又以產生同量「能」的煤或汽油，與產生同量能的標準中鈾作比價，最為適常簡便。據物理學家的估計，一磅中鈾所發生的熱能，的等於一千一百四十萬度電能，即相等於三十四年十一月上海電力公司所發一個月的電量。假使平均以二磅煤發一度電，則的等於一萬噸的煤。現在上海煤的官價約合十五元美金一噸，則一磅純粹的中鈾，要求與產生同量電力的煤相競爭，其成本不能超過美金十五萬元。如中鈾的精煉度為百分之十，則此種中鈾每磅不得超過一萬五千美元，因為含百分之十的中鈉原料比較容易提煉。這種當然是最粗略的估計，但可見原子能在工業上的運用，要求有經濟的價値，其成本不應超過上述的數字。若照原子彈的成本，要達到這個數字，並非易事！要求成本的便宜，須賴科學家與工程師的共同努力，然後有實用於工業上的可能。我們希望他們的絞腦努力工作，也許不久的將來有實現的可能。（本篇完）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕記者為公司法之修改及施行等問題，特走訪立法委員兼新公司法起草委員盛振為氏，承吿起草新公司法者，除其本人外，尚有立法委員張肇元及孫九錄二氏。新公司法共有三百六十一條，原定本年一月一日施行，後以英美商方面</p>
<p>稍有意見</p>
<p>，曾由國防最高委員會提交立法院再審修訂。彼本人來滬已一月有餘，對修訂詳情未盡明瞭，惟信修訂之點，大致與外國公司之規定有關。據稱：新公司法第七條規定謂：「本法所稱外國公司，謂以營利目的，依照外國法律，或經外國政府特許組織登記營業，並經中國政府認許，在中國境內營業之公司」。當初立法原意，有鑒於過去在我國設立之</p>
<p>外國公司</p>
<p>，在其本國原無業務可言，日期致無公司之設立，該項外國公司能在我國設立，在美係根據中國貿易條例，在英則係根據香港政府頒佈之經商條例，所有規定，較其本國之公司法方便簡單。故往往在我國懸一外國公司之牌照，或稱在外國業經註册，即稱外國公司。茲新公司法規定，在中國之外國公司，其設立條件之一，為在外國須有營業。今聞再番修訂之公司法，有將「營業」二字刪去之說。其他關於外國公司得在我國</p>
<p>購置地產</p>
<p>一點，聞亦將修訂，惟稱該項規定，係屬互惠性質。再番修訂後之新公司法，曾有於本年三月一日施行之說，惟現以政府亟待遷都，或又將延遲云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕美海軍第七艦隊醫官古克上尉，日前由渝返滬。昨日下午四時，在華懋飯店五樓，招待中外記者，報吿本月四日，在渝參觀行政院衛生署各項設施經過。對於中國公共衛生，盛加稱讚。</p>
<p>渝衛生署設備完美</p>
<p>古上尉稱，在今日中國具有世界上最佳之公共衛生組織，受有極良好訓練之醫師為數亦多。渝衛生署內設備齊全，對於細菌化騐，食品·藥品檢騐等成績均極佳。並自製DDT溶解劑及豆乳粉，其滋養成份不亞於牛乳。此外又作肺病調查，發覺在渝學生，其百分之五十有肺病嫌疑。</p>
<p>衛生教育亟應提倡</p>
<p>古上尉對衛生署公共衛生教育之宣傳，尤加讚揚。並謂實施公共衛生最主要點，即在教育民衆，灌輸醫藥常識，使彼等自知衛生之重要，而能保護健康，此點於從事新聞報道者，尤屬重大責任。中國人民，往往受宗教等種種迷信所影響，致忽略正當之治療。古上尉認為中國將來之醫師護士等，均應在本國之內訓練。聘請國外領導醫務人員，僅能負指導及建議之責，而不應從事於實際工作。</p>

<p>— 平簫</p>
<p>冬盡春來，又是傳染病發動的時候了，衛生局已經採取了各種預防的步驟。</p>
<p>衛生局防疫處處長陳邦憲說：「本市已經發現了白喉，天花，和腦膜炎，患者以前一個月最多，目前已大見减低。這次傳染病在冬季發生的原因，第一：是去冬天氣反常，暖和得和春天差不多，第二：是因為外埠如漢口等處，傳染病情形相當嚴重，不免有旅客帶了一點病菌到上海來。但傳染病最活躍的時候，總是春季，値此大戰之後，市民實在應當及早預防。」</p>
<p>聯合國救濟總署幫了衛生局不少忙，他們的醫藥專家常常和局方一同開會，擬具切合實際的計劃，供局方採納。聯總也供給了一點疫苗和配尼西林，最近又預備送一輛大汽車，專備發生了時疫之後，讓衛生局趕去消毒。衛生局極力提高效率，所以他們儘量减少「公文打圈子，」力求敏捷。染疫的病人如果家境不好，那麼醫藥等費用就全部免收。目前時疫的趨勢還不嚴重，如果慢慢的猖獗起來，衛生局預備和保甲配合起來，執行强迫防疫注射。</p>
<p>因為防疫就談起了自來水。陳處長說：現在自來水公司還是經常在送水樣檢騐的，結果相當滿意。不過，有時公司水源到很乾淨，而分到人家去時。因為水管日久失修，倒變得髒了，這一種檢查便很困難。而且，時疫大多發生於貧民區域，而在這些地方，居民因為自來水太貴，大家只喝井水。現在衛生局已經開始檢騐那些井，如果認為不合衛生，就立即把井封閉。衛生局目前正在想法使自來水的價格减到極低，使大家都能喝得起。</p>
<p>上海的垃圾也是衛生局的一個難題。浦東市中心等處不計在內，上海每天要有一千九百噸的垃圾，現在衛生局有二十九輛垃圾卡車，一千五百部手推車（其中完整無損的衹八百部），實在不够。據陳處長的估計，我們目前至少要有一百輛垃圾卡車才能把這些垃圾天天出淸。</p>

<p>上海電車公司工潮，社會局於七日邀勞方代表申述意見，八日邀資方代表申述意見，雙方意見頗為接近。</p>
<p>初步審查極為鄭重</p>
<p>昨日下午，社會局與公用局協商處理辦法，並審查公司之各項章程表格，社會局派課長張振遠，公用局派代表李開第，作初步審查。吳局長開先，復親自審核，極為鄭重。並與公用局趙局長洽商處理辦法，對於職工方面所提每一項條件，及最近雙方之意見，均作縝密之硏討。據張課長語記者，工潮之談判，至此已致良好之階段。預料明日召集勞資雙方談話，諒可獲完滿之結果。</p>
<p>資方代表拒絕出席</p>
<p>又粵菜業工潮僵持局面，迄未打開，社會局定昨日下午二時召集勞資雙方，繼續至社會局談判，勞方代表朱剛，菜館菜「膳幫」代表張榮華，「本幫」代表沈金松，「錫幫」代表張震雲，「蘇幫」代表何以成，「川揚幫」代表孫順年，西菜組代表諸世法，均準時至社會局。資方代表未到，均準時至社會局。資方代表未到，據記者探悉，資方某代表致函張課長，大意謂勞方所提條件過高，資方不能接受，在勞資談判未接近前，請社會局從緩調解，故調解會議不擬參加。此舉事實上即為資方拒絕調解之表示，社會局為顧到市民之飲食便利，與社會之安寗，將於十一日提出調解決定書，命令勞資雙方遵照云。</p>

<p>局長致詞</p>
<p>首由顧敎局長致詞，略謂：校長敎員，均為神聖的敎育事業而努力，應有同患難共甘苦之精神，對於學校措施，雙方均應有法治精神，一切言行，並須合乎情理，關於之江小學不續聘敎員事件，希望共同仲裁，俾能圓滿解決。</p>
<p>雙方報告</p>
<p>次由當事人雙方報告，首由敎員代表任玉英訴述：不被續聘之經過情形，繼由校長金日章報告不續聘敎員之原因，據稱羅淑秀曾以石硯擲破學生孫德祓頭部，江淑梅任意放課，韓黎明喜惡任性，敎導無方，陳蘭英，任玉英，一再拒絕校方指導，怠廢職務。</p>
<p>代表意見</p>
<p>顧局長聽取雙方報告後，即徵詢敎員方面，對於校長所述不續聘理由，有無駁正之處，當由各教員將平時服務情形，略作報告，對校長指摘各點略加解釋。旋由小學敎師職業保障促進會代表發言，希望對於以上各敎員仍能繼續聘任。中小學聯合會及市敎育會各代表，亦相繼發言，希望校長敎師雙方協調，但過失重大之敎師不妨請其改變環境，務使雙方有利。</p>
<p>直接談判</p>
<p>最後由顧敎局長懇切表示，不續聘之各敎員，當為設法，安插於市立學校，並個別詢問各敎員願否接受，時以職業保障會代表另有意見，未獲決定。爰再由顧局長召集雙方當事人赴局室，直接磋商，未有結果，故決定下星期一繼續商談，務必獲一公允解決辦法。</p>

<p>— 唐紹華</p>
<p>——由唐明皇說到孔夫子——</p>
<p>從前我國戲劇界曾供奉一個祖師，據說這個祖師便是唐明事隆基先生。唐明皇晚年倦於政治，很知道如何尋覓高尚娛樂，便是自己領導一班梨園弟子唱戲。然而以他的一生，究竟與戲劇的關係並不密切；要說與戲劇接近的，倒應該算另一姓李的——後唐莊宗，他才是徹頭徹尾的劇人皇帝，生前以演劇度日，死後以樂器火葬，只是他生時稍後，便趕不上唐明皇之受人崇拜罷了。</p>
<p>演劇在原始時代，決不是個專業，但到了戲劇成爲專門職業之後，而從事此職業的，便永遠處於不利的地位。儘管後世的演劇者自己冒認為梨園子弟，天子門生，但以其職業來論，始終離不了「以色藝服伺於人」約定案。這個定案，顯然地有著主奴的區別，唐明皇之領導梨園，無非要訓練一班更如意的奴隸，以備自己取樂。奴隸們忘記了自身的人格，反而以他做個主宰，做個神，無怪乎後世的梨園弟子無不被人目為戲子了。</p>
<p>其他姓李或不姓李的唐明皇，便是從古至今，站在取樂的觀點上與戲子發生關係的人們。這些人們雖不是皇帝但皆唐明皇一樣的心理，他愛護戲子，賞識戲子，都是基於戲子做戲，而他們取樂的關係上。這以外，地們不知道什麼是做戯，做戯除了供人取樂之外，還有什麼可存在的理由。唐明皇決不是因為缺少人們的諷諫而特設一班演戯的來諷諫自己，同時，崇奉唐明皇為祖師的演劇者，也唯恐不能討好主上而從事於演劇。由這樣的關係，構成相似於「賣笑」的行業，則其從業者的地位，便不能不日陷於不利之中了。</p>
<p>現在要振作自拔，最好的方法，就是要先打倒唐明皇，打倒成千成萬的唐明皇。凡是敎一人以色藝服事於人的，或專以別人的色藝供自己的，都是唐明皇，都應該打倒！毁去唐明皇的偶像，再從道一行業本身，加强其諷諫的效果—現在不是大家都在高唱；戯劇是敎育麼？</p>
<p>說到敎育，從前我國的敎育界也曾崇奉有一個祖師，這個祖師便是至聖先師孔子。</p>
<p>其實孔子不但是敎育之神，而他與戲劇的關係更是密切，因為他曾經倡導過戲劇敎育運動。比孔子更早的，或者還有個周公，也深切認識價値戲劇的。但因年代邈遠，著作若存若亡，關於這一門學問的論述，沒有孔子所倡言的詳細明白。（未完）</p>

<p>— 鐵梅</p>
<p>史瑞林</p>
<p>她愛談她的學生生活，最自誇的是她在北平城裏騎自行車的威風；怎樣冒險，怎樣出色。她不能忘情那玩皮嬉笑的年月，這是每一個人最愛好的童年。</p>
<p>她是藝術學校的學生，專習塑造，每天看見她一雙泥手，房子裏全是堆的泥巴。塑像的時候，她常歡喜加以改造別人的形狀，為着合於她的「美的理想」。但是別人不理解她這一點，她就常常氣得把自己最愛的塑像摔成粉碎，可是一當自己看着那粉碎的泥巴已是一無挽救的時候，又傷心又懊悔的哭了。這是一種有趣的性格，也可以說是因為太忠實自己理想的緣故。</p>
<p>淪陷後的北平，她苦痛的生活了多年，一種好活動的性格，不允許她再待下去了，她愛演劇而演劇常常不能不使人想起祖國和自由，於是她斷然的離開了有這父親·母親·弟·妹的家，投奔到大後方去了，一到重慶看見演劇生活熱烈蓬勃的情形，尤其演劇為自由為人民的崇高的目團的使她深深的喜愛了。因為出發點是這樣美好而正確，所以她在台上變成了一個性情最好的演員，只要她能担任的角色，她都樂於用功的去揣摩表現。</p>
<p>到了後方，不幾年，她已經演了很多戲，而每一個性格，都能見出她獨到之處，在「萬世師表」裏，她將扮演一個有趣而滑稽的人物，那時上海的觀衆會深深的記着她的名字的。</p>
<p>張雁</p>
<p>張雁，他從西北高原上來，身體結實得像條小牛，面孔顯露着鮮紅的血色。他從老遠的走來，你看着他昻然向前的步伐，就像一位志士在踏着血路。給人類開闢前程，那樣子永久留給你一種沉着的印象。</p>
<p>他的野力，不但從那火樣的眼神和粗曠的面形上；而且從他的聲音上，可以感到生命的充沛，或且就因為他是這樣一個單純而强烈的性格，所以當他演出這種傾向的人物時，特別使你感到逼人的力量。</p>
<p>我記得，當他飾演「哈姆雷特」裹的鬼魂時，誰都被他裂人心魄的報仇的聲音追逐着；而感覺到恐怖。整個的臺上，好傑陰雲密佈地面吐着火舌，那是一幅怎樣慘烈殘酷的景象啊！</p>
<p>他的野力，也使他歡喜在野外生活，歡喜太陽，歡喜盡情的唱歌，年靑的小伙子，他是生活得多麼愉快啊！</p>
<p>他演過的戲很多，岳飛是他的好戲，「北京人」裘的曾皓，「大馬戲團」裏的郝順風，都得到人們的讚美。這是一個已經有了成就的演員，尤其在生活上和對藝術的態度上，不計名，不計利，惟計一個誠實和爽快，可以和人做一個好朋友，他可以翻桌子跌板凳；因為別人的錯誤和自私。這一切出於他們單純和「野力」，我也希望他永久保持一顆這樣天眞的心。</p>
<h3 id="c112">笑劇的動作 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— 英郁</p>
<p>有一次我乘電車回家，在車廂里人都佔滿了座位。在我斜對面坐着一個衣冠楚楚？矮矮小小的中年男子，他的旁邊是一位肥大，粗邁的白俄女子。這位打扮得整整齊齊的小男子在就座以後，就迅速地瞟了白俄女子一眼，接着又忙着整理他的中裝大衣，於是又在座位上轉身掏錢給賣票員，熟練地把本票夾在右手食指和無名指的中間，又轉身把找還的零錢放進衣袋，又在上面輕輕拍了一下，以資放心，於是再整理好中裝大衣坐好，過不了幾秒鐘，他又在座位上轉動起來，這回是掏出一個眼鏡盒和一塊白手絹，他取出金邊眼鏡，轉身放回眼鏡盒，然後用大手絹擦乾凈眼鏡上的玻璃，於是帶上了眼鏡，又把手絹揩揩額頭和鼻子才又在座位上轉動身子放回大手絹，再動次地整理中裝大衣，並且坐好。又過二秒鐘他在移動手臂安放的位置，同時用左手的大拇指轉一了一下帶在左手無名指上的暗紫色寳石的成指……</p>
<p>他的這些動作都是連繼不斷，層出不窮，而且快速，灵活，無瑕可擊的。在他像蒼蠅似地忙碌着的時候，坐在他的身旁的肥大粗邁的白俄女人已經不勝其擾，不堪其擾了。她先露不耐煩的神氣，沒有效力，就用疾惡眼色橫了一二眼，還是沒有效力，最後乘我的鄰座的人下去的常兒，她就突然移過來坐在我的旁邊。那時那位小男人正在身掏口袋，又一次地大肆活動起來。</p>
<p>我靜靜地觀察着，不禁大為欣賞。因為這個中年小男人和白俄女子的一段精采的表演是很喜劇化的。尤其是那位靈活，忙碌的中年小男人更有參考的價値。因為他的一舉一動，是明快，迅速，豐富，圓滿，變化無窮，而且令人應接不暇，嘆為觀止，這眞是笑劇的動作的好範本！</p>
<h3 id="c113">說話的藝術 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— 孟慶</p>
<p>我國人不大講究說話的藝術。這一大半是自秦完成封建專制以後，就嚴禁天下人隨便說話，而歷朝的封建君王也繼續推行道種苛律。因此中國的語言一直沒有能發達起來。要把失傳了二千多年的說話的藝術重新創造起來，這樣於中國新文化的進步就可有極大的帮助。也就是說新文化運動的任務之一乃是再創中國的言語，說話的藝術。</p>
<p>在舞合上的用語問題特別感到嚴重。通常寫在紙上的不能唸，同時說得出口的又很難寫。所以目前話劇只能採用一種「白話」，不是口語。這種特性的文字只是較文言接近於口語，但有限度，到了某一種程度，它就變得跟文言一樣的固執和死板，不肯順從話的口語。那是為了中國文字還沒有達到拼音的階段，還是方塊字，單音字的緣故。</p>
<p>據張駿祥先生說：「柔蜜歐與幽麗葉」一劇在外國演出只需二個半鐘頭，而在重慶演時除掉換景的困難所費的時間外，尚需四小時。因為中國言語在一短句中總有好幾個頓逗，而外國文字就可運用子音，母音的方便，說得很快。</p>
<p>說到「柔蜜歐與幽麗葉」，我就對於這個有着很多的韻文的詩劇演出感到興趣。我眞不知道當時「中電」的演員們怎樣來克服我國語言的先天的缺陷的？很多語妙雙關的合詞，以我的估計簡直太難於傳達原來的含意了。例如，在第三幕第五景，幽麗葉跟她的母親談對表哥的死和凶手柔蜜歐，說出下面的話：</p>
<p>幽（雙關）：</p>
<p>是啊，到不了我的手，</p>
<p>我希望是我，我自己，為表哥報仇。</p>
<p>又如，下面幾句：</p>
<p>幽（衝出）：</p>
<p>眞地我永遠不會滿意柔蜜歐除非我看見了他了死了——我的心為着表哥這樣難過。至於演喜劇，我國的演員總要吃虧。最近我看了幾齣喜劇演出，「少年遊」的情調是悠悠盪盪的，演員唸詞快慢倒還凑活，「妙峯山」是明快，輕鬆，我就覺大部演員都很沉重，吃力的樣子，快不起來，也輕不起來。據調查的結果，演出需時三點半鐘，比第一次演出慢了半個鐘點。</p>
<p>可見說話藝術的再造是意義重大的事！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Military Trio Held Meeting Yesterday: Discussing Concrete Reorganization Methods, Transportation Ceasefire at the Center of Discussion <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Correspondent, 9th] The Marshall, Zhang Zhizhong, and Zhou Enlai military trio held their first meeting of the new year on the morning of the 9th. It is reported that matters of principle had already been exchanged and coordinated separately before the meeting, ensuring proper arrangements. The principles are divided into two parts: one is the assessment of military reorganization for gradual implementation, and the other is mixed organization. The discussion today focused on concrete implementation methods, centering on restoring transportation and the completion of conflict mediation by the Peiping Executive Headquarters and various executive groups, seeking agreements between both sides. In the future, after the restoration of transportation, all transportation lines will be handed over for civilian use, and military use will not be permitted. Colonel Baud's arrival was to report to Special Envoy Marshall on the progress of conflict mediation by the Peiping Executive Headquarters and various regions, and to request instructions on unresolved matters. After this meeting, the trio will reportedly inspect various ceasefire zones, and then proceed to Peiping.</p>
<p>[Our Peiping Correspondent, 8th] The work of the mediation force has recently encountered significant obstacles in Shandong, Chifeng, and transportation issues. (1) The Communist forces consider the defending troops in Taian and Zhangdian, Shandong, as puppet troops and do not allow them to receive food supplies. Yesterday, a train carrying food to Taian from Jinan was looted by people under the leadership of the Communist forces. The executive department has dispatched an additional team today to resolve this incident and has requested instructions from Chairman Chiang. The official side stated that the defending troops in Taian and Zhangdian are government security forces and not puppet troops. In fact, they fought hard during the War of Resistance. (2) The Chifeng security team is a force under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. According to the executive department's order of the 27th of last month, they should withdraw from participating in management and guarding, and the scope is not limited to north of the Yangtze River but also includes south of the Yangtze. The government side believes that all road administration in the country must be unified under the management of the Ministry of Transportation. The situation is currently deadlocked.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] The trio meeting composed of Marshall, Zhang Zhizhong, and Zhou Enlai was held at 10:00 AM on the 9th and lasted until 2:00 PM. Major General Baud, head of the executive group of the military mediation executive department, also participated, and discussed various issues in detail. It is reported that some agreements have been reached.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Troops, Whether Called Puppet Troops or Not, Must All Obey Ceasefire Orders: Temporary Directive Issued by the Mediation Executive Department <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 9th] The press release group of the Military Mediation Executive Department issued Joint Announcement No. 9 on the 9th. Peiping, February 9th. The difficulties faced by the Military Mediation Executive Department, which were quite serious, have been resolved after the issuance of a temporary directive. The directive was addressed to the commanding officers of various executive groups, the government, and the Chinese Communist Party, stipulating that all troops, whether called puppet troops or not, should be included within the scope of the ceasefire order. This order was finalized after repeated discussions by the heads of the various executive sections of the Mediation Executive Department, and was approved by the three committee members yesterday before being telegraphed to the various executive groups, troop commanders, and Chongqing. The original text is as follows: All troops, whether called puppet troops or not, if recognized by the government or the Chinese Communist Party, fall within the scope of the ceasefire order. These troops and the troops opposing them should maintain the positions held at 24:00 on January 13th, or maintain the positions determined by the executive group if necessary. This is a temporary measure. All issues regarding the status of the troops will await the final decision of the trio committee. The provision to include the above-mentioned troops in the overall ceasefire order will be of practical help in resolving local problems, especially in Shandong, Jiangsu, and Henan, because in those areas, the above-mentioned troops have become a rather serious obstacle to reaching agreements between government and Chinese Communist military commanders. Robertson, Chairman of the Mediation Executive Department Committee, expressed deep appreciation today for the spirit of cooperation among the heads of the various executive sections regarding this agreement, and said: The spirit of cooperation shown by Major General Song Shilun, head of the Chinese Communist Executive Section, and Major General Zhou Miewu, head of the Government Executive Section, in deciding this issue should be highly commended. Their constant discussions with Lieutenant Colonel Ete have resulted in an agreement that will greatly help in fulfilling the mission of the Executive Department. The government and Chinese Communist representatives here have once again expressed their sincerity and determination to implement the agreements of the Chongqing trio meeting.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 9th] A Communist Party spokesperson stated that the Communist Party does not intend to compromise on the issue of restoring transportation, but he believes that the Taian crisis is not serious and can be resolved within days. He also stated that the Communist Party allows Japanese and puppet troops to pass through Communist-occupied areas, but these troops must first be disarmed. He also stated that after the Taian puppet troops are disarmed, the Communist forces are willing to withdraw from the area to show that they have no intention of occupying the city. Regarding the issue of disarming the puppet troops, the Communist Party is willing to abide by the decision of the trio committee.

However, if the trio committee agrees to joint action by all three parties, then representatives from the American side, the government, and the Communist Party will be sent to take over the city.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Fushun Coal Mine Receiving Committee Member Zhang Xinfu Tragically Murdered; All Eight Members of Delegation Killed by Armed Forces; Soviet Side Formally Notifies Zhang Jia'ao <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th (Urgent Telegram)] Regarding the report of the assassination of Zhang Xinfu, Acting Northeast Special Envoy of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, confirmation has now been obtained. In recent days, varying rumors have circulated in Nanjing, Chongqing, and Beijing. This newspaper's reporter spent two days conducting extensive investigations and learned that Zhang was indeed murdered on January 16th while accompanying Soviet personnel from Shenyang to Fushun to negotiate the takeover of the coal mines in that area. At that time, the Fushun mining area was already under the control of the Communist forces. Initially, when Zhang's sudden disappearance was reported, rumors spread in the north that Zhang had been detained, and it was heard that after being detained, he was sent by the Communist forces to Changchun. Relevant parties in Nanjing and Chongqing have indeed received reports of this. The details are currently being investigated and inquired into thoroughly. According to those familiar with the recent situation in the Northeast, the fact of Zhang's murder appears at first glance to be extremely mysterious and shocking, but given the present day and Zhang's position, this kind of incident is not unexpected. Fushun mining area is the largest coal mine in the country, with recent annual production reaching a huge 8 million tons. In the past, in addition to supplying all the needs of the South Manchurian Railway, a huge amount could also be transported out to supply the power needs of some factories in Japan. Zhang Xinfu himself was one of China's leading mining experts, already enjoying a great reputation before the war. After the war, he presided over the Mercury Mine Management Office in western Hunan and northeastern Guizhou provinces, achieving considerable success. Two years ago, he presided over the largest mining area in southern Jiangxi, making many achievements. Zhang was originally from the Northeast. This time, he went to the Northeast to participate in the takeover work, initially serving as a specialist in the office of Special Envoy Sun Yueqi, and was recently appointed to this position. At this critical moment in the nation's reconstruction, it is unfortunate that he died for the sake of national construction. Surely not only the entire mining industry will mourn his loss!</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 9th] Zhang Xinfu, a member of the Ministry of Economic Affairs receiving committee who went to Fushun to take over the coal mines, was murdered on the way from Fushun to Shenyang. Also killed at the same time were his entourage Xu Changqing, Liu Cichun, Niu Junzhang, Zhang Shede, and three police officers. Details are being investigated. According to reports, Zhang left Changchun for Fushun on January 7th accompanied by Lieutenant General Maliyi, assistant vice-chairman of the railway, traveling by train. He stayed in Shenyang for several days while General Maliyi contacted the Soviet troops stationed in Fushun, before departing for Fushun. After arriving in Fushun, he telephoned Shenyang, saying that he had lost his freedom. Afterwards, his whereabouts were unknown until January 20th, when a report was received stating that Zhang and his party of eight were taken off their special train at Lishizhai station on the evening of the 16th, while returning to Shenyang, and were all stabbed to death outside the station in a very tragic manner. Regarding this matter, the Soviet side formally notified Chairman Zhang Jia'ao, saying that they were killed by 300 armed troops and that the bodies had been found.</p>

<p>[United Press, London, 9th] The United Nations General Assembly was informally scheduled to close at the end of this week. However, due to the fact that many issues, especially the location of the headquarters, remain unresolved, it is expected that the closing will be postponed. It was generally expected beforehand that the work of the General Assembly could be completed today, but as of now, half of the issues still need to be resolved. It is now being extended to close on the 11th or 12th of this month. It is expected that the Security Council will submit the issue of Syria and Lebanon's demand for the withdrawal of British and American troops for discussion early next week.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 8th] Whether the permanent headquarters of the United Nations should be located in or near New York City seems to be becoming the focus of discussion. France proposed today that the location of the permanent headquarters be postponed until the autumn of this year, and opposed the permanent headquarters being located in New York City. The Headquarters Committee discussed this matter today, and the New York and anti-New York factions are gradually deploying their positions. The split in the battle lines originated between the five major powers. On the one hand, the Soviet Union, Britain, and China support New York City as the temporary headquarters, with the Stamford Greenwich area as the permanent headquarters. On the other hand, France suggests that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Lai Yi, should select a temporary headquarters in a location where temporary facilities are readily available, and the permanent headquarters will be decided when the United Nations General Assembly reconvenes in September.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 9th] When the Security Council of the United Nations meets at 5:00 PM today (1:00 AM Sunday, Shanghai time), Ukraine's complaint against the British troops stationed in Indonesia may be withdrawn. The Ukrainian representative, Manuelski, may not be able to attend due to a cold, thus delaying the resolution of the case. However, there are various signs indicating that major representative countries have already held consultations, leading many to believe that the complaint will be withdrawn. If Ukraine insists on its accusation, the Security Council must recommend sending a committee to Indonesia. At the same time, it is heard that the Netherlands is planning to issue a communique announcing the basic policy for resolving the Indonesian issue. The Dutch Foreign Minister revealed that good news will be coming soon.</p>

<p>[French News Agency, London, 8th] The Lord Mayor of London hosted a banquet at City Hall tonight to entertain delegates from various countries to the United Nations General Assembly. This was the first such banquet since 1939. The hall was newly decorated, and ceremonial guards in splendid uniforms stood by. Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Vishinsky and other representatives of the country were not present. After the banquet, the ancient custom of passing the cup was held to show intimacy.

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 9th] President Truman called on all parties yesterday while hosting journalists to fully support his nine-point plan to prevent world famine. He stated: India's national rice production is 12 to 15 percent short of the usual average need. Japan's rice production is also 15 percent short of normal. The food situation in many parts of the East is even worse than in Europe. For example, the Philippines and the seed production has declined, comparing to being one-fifth lower than before the war. Since Japan's surrender, aid to China has been stepped up. China enjoys the highest priority in future shipments of relief goods. The President pointed out that before Japan's surrender, due to the lack of usable ports, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's shipments to China were severely restricted.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 8th] In various parts of northern Vietnam, Vietnamese revolutionaries have recently committed illegal acts against our overseas Chinese, and the lives and property of our overseas Chinese have suffered huge losses directly and indirectly. On the 5th, when our garrison was carrying out a mission in Phu Luong Trang, 50 kilometers from Hanoi, they were attacked by armed elements of the Vietnamese Provisional Government. Our authorities, since there are no normal diplomatic relations with the Vietnamese government, cannot lodge protests with them, so they have ordered their subordinates to strengthen defenses and effectively protect overseas Chinese in various places. This reporter specifically visited Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Vietnamese Provisional Government, to inquire about the handling of the matter by the Vietnamese side. According to him, Ho expressed deep regret after the occurrence of cases of Vietnamese people violating the lives and property of overseas Chinese. It is said that the Vietnamese government sent personnel to the scene of the incident to investigate and confirm the facts, and they have joined our garrison in punishing the perpetrators. Ho also told reporters that he will strictly restrain the Vietnamese people in the future so that similar unfortunate events will not happen again.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] US Secretary of State Byrnes said today that he will recommend that the three powers conclude peace treaties with the Balkan small countries, and then begin preparing peace treaties with Japan and Germany. Byrnes believes that the treaties with Japan and Germany can be completed within a year or 18 months. He said that the peace treaty with Japan is easier to draft because Japan has a government, while it may take some time for Germany to have a government. Byrnes recalled the words of the late Roosevelt: "Before Japan can live peacefully with its neighbors, it may take 15 years or more. The Allied countries must occupy and supervise Germany and Japan until the above-mentioned period, so as to ensure that they fulfill the provisions of the treaty." He then requested the cancellation of his proposal made at the Moscow conference to hold a tripartite foreign ministers' meeting in Washington in April, as they are planning to meet at the Paris Peace Conference in May.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 7th Special Dispatch] A Chinese classical drama performed by American actors has premiered at a Broadway theater, which is a pioneering event in New York theater history. The play is called "Pipa Ji," with the famous singer and actress Mary Martin playing the female lead Zhao Wuniang. The Broadway "Pipa Ji" script is based on Bazin's 1841 French translation. The play uses Chinese costumes and background, and five-fifths of the play is singing. Most New York theater critics criticized the performance, saying it was gorgeous and dazzling, more so than the drama. However, the introduction of "Pipa Ji" to Broadway is a pioneering event in which Chinese drama is entirely performed by actors.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 8th] President Truman today refused to pardon General Yamashita Tomoyuki, and the fate of the Manila killer has been decided, with no way to save him. The President did not even issue a formal rejection of Yamashita's last-minute request, but simply sent a secretary to verbally inform reporters that the President did not want to take any action. At the same time, the War Department was also happy and informed MacArthur of the President's intentions. Therefore, the temporary suspension of the execution order was naturally canceled.</p>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 8th] Colonel Nagano, the former commander of the Japanese Kempeitai, is the first war criminal in Hong Kong. During the Japanese occupation, his headquarters was no different from hell on earth, making those who heard of it change color. In 1943, he executed 33 Chinese and Europeans, which was his greatest crime. Nagano was transferred away from Hong Kong a year ago and arrived in Hong Kong today by ship from Japan. Nagano had removed his military uniform and was wearing a neatly ironed brown casual suit. He carried his suitcase into the waiting truck in a pretentious manner and quickly drove to Stanley Prison for imprisonment. Other accomplices had already been detained in the prison. The date of the trial has not yet been decided. According to news obtained here a week ago, when Nagano was powerful in Hong Kong, he lived with a Chinese mistress in a certain residence requisitioned by the Japanese army. The mistress had been paraded through the streets of Guangzhou in full dress, and was escorted to the suburbs for execution.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 9th] At the end of the European War, the US military used a new weapon specifically for clearing landmines called "Snake." When the US military advanced, "Snake" could cut the electric wires, causing the landmines to explode in advance. The new weapon is a long metal gun filled with high explosives with a pear-shaped metal "nose," guided to its destination by a light tank. It can cross or detour around rocks or large trees. "Snake" is 400 feet long, 14 inches wide, and 5 inches high, weighing approximately 900 pounds, including 4,480 pounds of high explosives. It has parallel detonating cords sandwiched between crimped aluminum sheets.</p>
<h3 id="e38">"Sunset Empire" Snapshot: The Most Realistic Problems are Food and Clothing <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Canglong</p>
<p>Mr. Song Dehe, the Tokyo correspondent for the Central News Agency, gracefully flew from Tokyo to Shanghai a few days ago. He brought with him a snapshot of the "Sunset Empire" after its surrender. The reporter, with eager anticipation, wanted to reproduce this fresh snapshot in its entirety to share it with everyone.</p>
<p>Mr. Song, dressed from head to toe in the attire of an American war correspondent, humbly said, "I saw too many things; I don't know where to begin." He lit a cigarette and, through the swirling smoke, recounted fragments of Japan.</p>
<p>He first raised the most realistic problem facing Japan today: that is, the Japanese have no guarantee of food or clothing. Therefore, any snapshot invariably contains the word "suffering." Many large cities were severely bombed, leading to housing problems.</p>
<p>Japan's political system and the institutions of the military and financial cliques collapsed entirely with this surrender. At the end of March this year, after the general election, Japan's political system can be said to have achieved preliminary success. As for the future direction, it will depend on the thinking of their political leaders. The Japanese people now have a great deal of freedom, but most of them do not know how to use it. Centuries of traditional thought have bound the Japanese people, causing them to follow the government's orders in everything they do. He said that this kind of thinking urgently needs to be reformed.</p>
<p>Currently, the more prominent political parties active in Japan are the Republican Party, the Socialist Party, the Progressive Party, and the Liberal Party, among others. The latter two parties are reorganized from former old parties. Recently, the Republican Party and the Socialist Party have had intense competition. It seems that the Socialist Party has gained an advantage and is relatively stronger. It is said that this party was formed by merging three small parties before the war.</p>
<p>Japan's luck can be said to be very good because General MacArthur is more than fair in everything he does for them! At present, Japan's financial problems are very difficult. Although it is said that the costs of the Allied occupation of Japan must be supplied by Japan, the expenditure on these occupation costs is only about 140 million yuan per month, less than one-tenth of Japan's monthly military expenditure during the war. Therefore, according to the Japanese calculation, it is hoped that the domestic debt of the country can be repaid within six years. As for foreign reparations, it is said that the issue is too complicated and remains to be studied. Because of the lack of various raw materials such as silk, cotton, and wool, and because the workers in Kyushu and Hokkaido are unwilling to work, the coal in these two places has not been mined. Therefore, most of the factories in Japan are unable to produce. Machines are idle, and chimneys no longer emit smoke.</p>
<p>The reporter couldn't help but ask him about the situation after the Japanese nationals returned to their country. He said: "When Japanese nationals return to their country, they will first encounter the housing problem. Leaving aside the problems of food and clothing, the problem of employment after returning to the country cannot be solved. Although there is still a rationing system now, the rations are only half of what they used to be because of the scarcity of goods. Those who have a little money get their supplies from the black market. A small five-inch-long fish in the black market sells for more than ten yen, equivalent to more than sixty cents in US dollars; the market price of rice in the black market is thirty-two times higher than the official price. Residents in big cities are all under severe threat, while people in the countryside are relatively better off because they have production."</p>
<p>Therefore, a very strange phenomenon has occurred in Japan: it is difficult for people in the city to find jobs, but everyone is unwilling to find jobs. For example, there are more than 700,000 unemployed people in Tokyo. At that time, several factories needed more than 30,000 people, but no one went. The factory wage is only a dozen yen a day, just enough to buy a five-inch-long fish from the black market. As a result, these people all ran to the countryside to buy radishes, green vegetables, rice, and the like, and then sold them in the black market in the city, earning just enough to make a living. I told him that this kind of "small business" was also very popular in Shanghai during the enemy-puppet occupation. The taste of it is now the Japanese' turn to experience!</p>
<p>Mr. Song also said: "The people in Japan are very unhappy with their 'Imperial Army' that did not die and return. At first, they were blinded by the warlords and indulged in the high-sounding rhetoric of the 'Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere' all day long, listening to the illustrious battle records of the 'Imperial Army.' When the news of the surrender was announced, they realized that everything they had heard in the past was just a mirage. They forced a smile when they sent the 'Imperial Army' out on expeditions and invasions in batches, but now they hang their heads dejectedly, greeting their return with aversion. This exposes the Japanese people's depressed and painful psychology after being deceived!"</p>
<p>During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Mr. Song, in the guise of a reporter, traveled all over the world. He also visited many important battlefields in the motherland, such as Taierzhuang. He left his footprints in Vietnam, India, Burma, Hong Kong, Singapore, and India. After the end of the war with the Allied forces attacking Italy, he followed the US aircraft carrier Task Force 58, landing successively in New Guinea, New Britain, Saipan, Guam, Luzon Island in the Philippines, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. On the way, he went to the United States to cover the opening of the United Nations General Assembly. After Japan's surrender, he landed with the American army near Yokohama and has been there ever since.</p>

<p>Minhang</p>
<p>Military Discipline Inspection Group Visits and Inspects: A group of fifteen people from the Military Discipline Inspection Group of the Military Commission, led by Director Wu Cangzhou, a lieutenant general, and Chen Linrong, a lieutenant general, arrived in Minhang at around 11:00 am yesterday (the 8th). Xu, the magistrate of Shanghai County, upon hearing the news, immediately greeted them and summoned the heads of various departments and all staff members, requesting them to give instructions in the county government auditorium. After Magistrate Xu delivered a welcome speech, the heads of various departments successively reported on the work situation of each department. Then, Director Wu gave a speech to the entire staff, inquiring in detail about the county's administrative plan and hoping to establish a new lifestyle and reverse the declining trends.</p>
<p>Kunshan</p>
<p>The Postal Workers' Slowdown Resolved: Postal workers in our county once slowed down work the day before yesterday. The reason was that the salaries of postal workers in bureaus outside Shanghai differed greatly from those in the Shanghai area, so they demanded that the bureau increase the salary of each postal worker to 70,000 yuan (the monthly salary of postal workers in Kunshan was 40,000 yuan). This matter has now been successfully resolved. Starting from the 7th, normal service has resumed.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>The District Head is Accused of Dereliction of Duty and Sent to Court for Trial: Wu Bin, the head of the second district in our county, has made no achievements since taking office. Now, the county government has found evidence of dereliction of duty and ordered his arrest. After strict interrogation, the suspect will be transferred to the local court for prosecution.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>District Boundaries Restored to Pre-War State: During the enemy-puppet era, the boundaries of districts, townships, and towns in the entire county of Xiyi were handled entirely by the enemy-puppet regime, resulting in chaotic boundaries. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, County Magistrate Fan Tisheng, in accordance with the demobilization measures, first restored the district boundaries to their original state before the 26th year of the Republic (1937), and then gradually restored the township and town boundaries. However, the boundaries of Tonghan Town outside the Guangfu Gate and Beitang Town outside the North Gate have not been restored to their original state due to the machinations of some people. Yesterday, the county magistrate specially instructed Lian Wenxi, the head of the civil affairs section, to handle everything in accordance with the old case of the 26th year of the Republic (1937) and ordered the townships and towns to hand over as soon as possible to avoid disputes.</p>
<p>Nantong</p>
<p>A Large Number of Traitors Escorted to Suzhou for Trial: The local administrative commissioner's office has dispatched the security team to escort 28 traitors from the enemy-puppet era, including Yu Siliang and Zhang Xun, and two traitors detained by the local court, Wang Zhenbang (the president of the enemy-puppet Nantong Local Court) and Ma Yipo, to the Jiangsu High Court for trial. At that time, the families of the criminals, upon hearing the news, rushed to the gate of the Jiangsu Fourth Prison to wait and see them off with tears, a rather tragic scene.</p>
<p>Pinghu</p>
<p>The Suspension of County Taxes Affects Revenue and Expenditure: Since the county tax office in our county learned of the news that the new director was taking office, all collection offices have shown a state of suspension. All directors have resigned one after another, which has greatly affected the county government's finances. It is reported that the new Director Wang Shaorong convened a meeting of the heads of various departments yesterday and decided to give priority to the original tax collectors to start collecting taxes in order to avoid the suspension of tax revenue and affect the county government's revenue and expenditure.</p>

<p>Opening a Theater to Prosper the Market: Since the recovery, the security in our county has become more consolidated than before.

The petition has been approved and formally opened on February 2nd.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Enduring the Burden, Striving for Future Sweet Fruit: Looking Ahead to Xinjiang's Prospects: The Internal Problems of Various Ethnic Groups Should Be Resolved Quickly <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Special Report by Our Newspaper, Written by Zhu Minwei After Returning from Xinjiang</p>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, I was ordered by Director Jian of the Political Department of the Aviation Commission to go to Xinjiang on official business. Although the time I stayed in Xinjiang was not long, I had a lot of contact with people from all walks of life. Therefore, I would like to put forward some issues based on the impressions I gained from my own observations, which may be helpful for readers' reference.</p>
<p>Xinjiang is a border province, and there are also tens of thousands of Kazakhs causing trouble within the territory. Undoubtedly, the use of force has been a fact for a year. In the past year, the government has used troops, such as the infantry sent from the interior. These troops are stationed all along the line from the Jinghe front to Hami. As of September last year, they were still using the old system, old equipment, and old provisions (different from the new system after Minister Chen Cheng's military reorganization).</p>
<h3 id="e44">The National Army Units in Xinjiang Province Must Adapt to the Characteristics of the Desert Region <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Of course, before the victory, in order to cope with the war against Japan, it was impossible to send elite troops to Xinjiang Province for defense. However, Xinjiang Province is an important gateway to our country. Although its real value is not as great as that of the Northeast, its future prospects can provide a place for tens of thousands or even millions of Chinese people to live for a long time. Since it is a gateway, it doesn't make a good impression to have the internal security forces poorly dressed and underfed, and then suddenly go to war. Moreover, in the vast deserts of Xinjiang, how can they deal with the elusive Kazakh cavalry?</p>
<p>In terms of combat methods, the government troops have been in Xinjiang for a year, and all battles, large and small, have been defensive line or point defense battles. The other side always attacks or invades. This combat method is correct according to the entire national policy, because the government has no intention of war, let alone the intention to eliminate the Kazakhs. Only in order to protect the interests of all ethnic groups, stabilize their lives, and support the government's sovereignty, are the necessary troops stationed in the Kazakh-disturbed areas. Due to the combat methods and the characteristics of the cold desert region of Xinjiang, the reporter believes that the following points are worth paying attention to:</p>
<p>Since the troops stationed in Xinjiang are defensive and have no offensive meaning, the number does not need to be large. Too many troops, equipment, provisions, bases, and transportation will all cause problems. They cannot play a role in preventing the Kazakhs, but instead, they will put an excessive burden on the people.</p>
<p>The troops that have already entered Xinjiang Province must immediately implement the new system, equip them with new equipment, especially targeting the severe cold, wind, and snow in the cold desert region. Every soldier, horse, and car must be able to adapt to the local climate, and they must be given new provisions so that every soldier is a strong and elite soldier.</p>
<p>Long-term stationed strongholds, such as county towns and important points on transportation lines, should be mobilized to build barracks sufficient for the stationed troops. We must change the early habit of our Chinese troops living in the homes of the people wherever they go. If the lives of officers and soldiers are improved, they are fed and clothed, and when there is no war (defensive stationing and combat time are very short), they work to build barracks to avoid disturbing the people. This is the necessary behavior to give a good impression to all ethnic groups in the border province.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Well-Fed and Strong Troops and Horses: The Emergency Situation May Turn Relaxed <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>If the above points can be achieved, I believe that the government will definitely not suffer any losses, and officers and soldiers can be well-fed, and people of all ethnic groups in the war zone can live in peace. What remains is that the elite troops can confront the isolated Kazakhs, and the military situation in Xinjiang Province will not be so serious as to implement the defense of Dihua. In the past, the emergency situation in Dihua once turned relaxed due to Minister Zhang Zhizhong's visit to Xinjiang for negotiations, but how the subsequent developments will be remains difficult to predict, and optimism is not warranted.</p>
<p>After most of the military problems are solved, it will be possible to carry out various administrative measures with more time. Chairman Wu once said in an interview with reporters that there is no serious ethnic struggle in Xinjiang. This can be seen in the following examples: In addition to the Han people who volunteer to serve in the military, the Xinjiang Provincial Government has stopped conscription. Therefore, all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have no military service burden. Economically, the government always does things that benefit the people, and taxes are not heavy. All ethnic groups seek free development in their respective economic activities and have no time or desire to engage in ethnic conflicts and struggles. Because Xinjiang is vast and sparsely populated, with abundant livestock and lush vegetation, the food, cotton, fruits, silk, wool, salt, and timber are enough to support the lives of Xinjiang's four million people of all ethnic groups. Although the Han people are not natives, they have never had conflicts due to race, economy, or religion with the Uyghur, Mongol, and other ethnic groups for decades. The Kazakh disturbances in the past year have only been due to the Kazakhs' long-standing habit of plundering. When they see others as weak, they become strong, followed by plundering. If other factors are added, it is easy to cause chaos. After the government has a small but elite troop to control them, there will be no major chaos. Therefore, the implementation of the entire Xinjiang administration has turned to one question: Will our government profit from Xinjiang? Or will our government subsidize Xinjiang in order to preserve the integrity of the country?</p>

<p>As far as the reporter's observations in Xinjiang are concerned, the people currently sent to Xinjiang by the central government are: troops, government officials, and technical personnel, medical personnel, teachers, etc. In addition, the government has issued the Xinjiang-only circulating New Xinjiang currency in Xinjiang (one New Xinjiang currency is equivalent to five legal currencies).</p>
<p>The government relies on its power and credit to attract paper money, which is exchanged for the production of the people of Xinjiang and the supply of the lives of military, political, educational, and technical personnel who come to Xinjiang. These new personnel in Xinjiang then engage in the civilizing work of Xinjiang to benefit the people and the country of Xinjiang. If it is said that the country's actions in Xinjiang can be profitable, then it can only be said that it has preserved this piece of land belonging to China for the country. But to do this well, it requires the central government to do it with all its strength, and it cannot be done simply by handing it over to the personnel who come to Xinjiang.</p>
<p>To benefit the people of Xinjiang, some achievements have already been made in Xinjiang's construction and education work, but the country still needs to bring new strength to irrigate it. We have this piece of land in Xinjiang, which is a burden for the country. Although it is not very profitable at the moment, it will be of great help to China's overall development in the future. Therefore, I believe that even though the country is currently experiencing difficulties everywhere in its recovery and is incurring huge costs, the policy of subsidizing Xinjiang should not be interrupted.</p>
<p>The implementation of the subsidy policy must endure the current burdens and seek future achievements.</p>

<p>In terms of people, when the central government sends a new person to Xinjiang, it must select outstanding talents. Sending one person must give a warmth to all ethnic groups, making them inward-looking. The talents needed for Xinjiang's construction and education must be supplied continuously, and there should be no abnormal phenomenon of all talents flowing eastward during the recovery.</p>
<p>In terms of materials, the material needs of Xinjiang's construction period must be met as much as possible. For example, the four hundred tons of machinery from Xinjiang Xinfeng Textile Factory must be found a way to transport them here. The tea, sugar, and cloth needed by the people of Xinjiang must be transported in continuously according to the needs of the people of Xinjiang for materials from the interior. Here, I will give one example to cover the rest.</p>
<p>In terms of transportation, before the railway is built, the government must implement cheap car travel to connect Xinjiang with the interior. The faster the railway goes west, the better.</p>
<p>Now that the Sino-Soviet Agreement has been signed, we must try to obtain the Soviet Union's assistance in Xinjiang's construction, and we should not be stingy even if we give the other party great mutual benefits.</p>

<p>The trip to Xinjiang is like a dream. All I can think of now are the above points. There is one question left, which is the question of how to make all ethnic groups internalized. If the above-mentioned military and administrative aspects can be achieved to some extent, all ethnic groups will only ask for a stable life and a gradual improvement in their economic and cultural lives. If the government can achieve the above points, it can make all ethnic groups internalized. Then, we should start to import movies, dramas, science, education, and modern scientific lifestyles from the interior into Xinjiang one by one, while maintaining and promoting the languages, scripts, and cultures of all ethnic groups. Universities and various public undertakings in the interior (such as railways and highways) should absorb the youth of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang to receive education and study. These are all ways to make people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang internalized. If we persist in doing so, we can produce good results. In this way, Xinjiang will be completely integrated into the territory of China, which is just around the corner. (Early February 1946 in Shanghai)</p>

<h3 id="e50">Utilizing Surplus Milk <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Donating to Provide for a Portion of Elementary School Children</p>
<p>To the esteemed editor:</p>
<p>Recently, while chatting with some friends, I heard a surprising piece of news: the Shanghai Milk Shed's daily production of over 30,000 pounds of milk has a surplus portion that cannot find an outlet. Originally, for a city like Shanghai with a population exceeding five million, a supply of just over 30,000 pounds of milk is already quite meager. But to think that even this meager supply has a surplus that cannot find an outlet truly astonished me when I heard it. Some say that the general public's living standards have not yet reached the point where they can afford to drink milk; this economic problem certainly exists. Others say that our people do not have the habit of drinking milk. Still others say that even among those who have the money and can afford to drink milk, many still believe in the advertisements for tonics on the radio and fundamentally do not truly understand the benefits of milk; this is a lack of general nutritional knowledge among the people. All of these situations are important factors contributing to the surplus of milk. The purpose of writing this short article is not to resolve the various reasons for this milk surplus, but rather to seek a suitable and useful outlet for this surplus milk.</p>
<p>Just recently, in an article I read in a certain day's Shen Bao, "An Extremely Important But Neglected Group—The Nutritional Problems of Poor Students," I was deeply moved by this article. Because from my position as a doctor, the talents cultivated with many years of effort and hard work, if their bodies remain weak and frail like the "sick man of East Asia," this is an irreparable loss to the country. And in terms of national health, it is a serious problem that urgently needs to be remedied. At the same time, I recalled an essay by Mr. Chen Hengzhe in the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao last year, "Save Our Next Generation of Citizens" (the title was so large because the original text is not at hand), and I was also extremely sympathetic at the time. I believe that anyone who has read this article will also be sympathetic. But what is the use of sympathy! The encouragement of words is only the first step in starting to act practically, and the most important need is that after encouraging words, we must have planned and step-by-step action.</p>
<p>In the past, the movement to raise scholarships in the Shen Xin and Xin Shen newspapers was very much valued by many people, and as a result, a lot of money was raised, allowing poor students to continue their studies. Hasn't there been a movement to raise loan scholarships and scholarships recently? Therefore, it seems that to solve the current practical problem of a milk surplus that cannot find an outlet, we can also imitate the method of raising loan scholarships and scholarships as a way to solve this problem.</p>
<p>The first step in implementing this method is to launch a fundraising campaign to purchase the surplus milk on the market. The owner of the Milk Shed should set a price that is only enough to cover costs. In terms of fundraising methods, a person can regularly commit to purchasing ten pounds or more per day each month, or it doesn't have to be measured in pounds, and donating a sum of money is also acceptable. In short, it is hoped that people who sympathize with this movement will donate funds, no matter how small, in order to purchase as much of this surplus milk, reduced to the lowest cost, as possible.</p>
<p>The second step is to use this surplus milk to provide it free of charge to a portion of elementary school children who need to drink milk. The "portion" refers to children who, after a physical examination, are found to be malnourished or otherwise in need of milk; at the same time, when starting to implement this, it should begin with children from poor families. This method of providing milk free of charge was implemented in the United Kingdom for women, infants, and general children during the recent war. As for regular implementation, it is very common in public health agencies or elementary schools in Europe and the United States. Before the war, there was a method of giving soy milk in Nanjing, China. Free milk has not yet been implemented. Based on these two steps, I have several brief methods:</p>
<p>(1) To utilize this surplus milk and apply it appropriately, local sympathetic and enthusiastic people should launch publicity campaigns, such as using radio, advertisements in movie theaters, and special columns in major newspapers to advocate in writing, etc.</p>
<p>(2) Imitating the method of raising loan scholarships, entrust banks or newspaper offices to collect funds on behalf of the government to provide free milk subsidies to a portion of elementary school children, and a committee should be formed by sympathetic and enthusiastic people to manage the matter.</p>
<p>(3) The local health education committee (an institution formed by local health and education authorities) should send personnel (doctors and nurses) to examine the physical condition of local elementary school children, and use the results of this examination as the sole basis for providing free milk.</p>
<p>(4) Consult with the milk industry association to determine the lowest cost price, and contact them about how to transport this surplus milk from Shanghai (assuming there is still a surplus) to other larger cities, such as Wu County, Wuxi, Wujin, and Zhenjiang along the Shanghai-Nanjing line.</p>
<p>(5) This surplus milk must be regularly inspected by local health authorities (because the harm of unqualified milk is well known to us). At the same time, strict management of milk sheds is very important, because perhaps a very small number of milk sheds are still not up to standard.</p>
<p>In addition, there are naturally some minor technical issues that need to be discussed, which will be left to those who sympathize with and are enthusiastic about this movement to study. I am simply putting forward my thoughts as a suggestion, hoping that Shen Bao will advocate for it, and even more hoping that enlightened people in society will not hesitate to offer their advice.</p>

<h3 id="e51">When Will You Visit the Moon Palace? <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— By Professor Lockeard</p>
<p>I don't know how many people have asked me, "When are you going to visit the Moon Palace?" Before any new invention, such as ships, airplanes, etc., is introduced to the world, people laugh and say, "Impossible." Isn't that so? Fifty years ago, who believed that flight was possible? Even those in positions of authority said that flight had no military importance. Doctors in the mid-19th century were still saying that a speed of sixty miles per hour was fatal to the human heart. Twenty-five years ago, how many people could believe that one day people could sit comfortably in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean on an ocean liner, comfortably watch their homes, and talk to their families?</p>
<p>The organizational goals and plans of</p>
<p>The British Interplanetary Society</p>
<p>are truly hard for the world to believe. Fifty years from now, will we still be able to do without the fuels used in today's world? Fuel is indeed our biggest problem. This is not only an Interplanetary Society, but also a Rocket Society, to test the extent to which this rocket theory will affect human life in the future in "normal" space travel.</p>
<p>Germany also has an Interplanetary Society, which has been strongly supported by the government for fifteen years. Its members are leaders in various fields with scientific thinking, such as astrology, aeronautics, chemistry, physics, and radio engineering. The British Interplanetary Society was established in 1933, composed of a small number of scientists, many doctors, adventurers, and mathematicians.</p>
<p>Until the outbreak of the war, the main subject of research for the Interplanetary Society was how to set up a means of transportation that met the conditions for scientific travel to reach the surface of the moon. During the war, the Interplanetary Society was not very active. Now its main task is still to study and analyze the initial results.</p>
<p>The British Rocket Experiment</p>
<p>The result of the British flight to the Isle of Wight rocket was that it exploded before landing, proving that the fuel was unsuitable. Countless experiments have been done for rocket fuel. Liquid gas was only recently allowed for commercial use, or it may give people clues to invent many new types of explosives, which may create a new era in high-speed travel. It is not yet known.</p>
<p>Using rockets is a major modern invention. Although relatively speaking, it is not a large horsepower, it has been as large as several thousand. The problem of storing thousands of tons of fuel is complicated enough. Wouldn't a spacecraft to overcome space need hundreds of millions of tons of fuel? However, preliminary experiments can only use smaller rockets, and they must also carry signals so that people on Earth can see them. Liquid fuel not only simplifies the control of manned rockets, but also increases the speed at which rockets escape the Earth's gravitational range. High speed is necessary because, on the one hand, it overcomes the infinite space, and on the other hand, rockets rely on high-speed temperature to maintain efficiency.</p>
<p>The first person with technical arguments and common sense to</p>
<p>Dream of Space Travel</p>
<p>was the Russian Tsiolkovsky. As early as 1903, he had this idea. In 1914, American Dr. Goddard published his famous work, advocating the use of the highest rockets for technical reconnaissance of space. It can be seen that the concept of space travel had already sprouted, and interplanetary research has since become a more accurate science. German, American, and French scientists have devoted themselves to research work.</p>
<p>Preparing months of food, air, and entertainment on the moon currently seems impossible. It is said that a successful spacecraft should reach a speed of seven miles per second. It is not easy for people to live on the moon. Because the air pressure is too low, tea must be boiled in a sturdy metal container and drunk immediately, otherwise it will cool down immediately. There are no trees on the moon, and the bed is just a piece of plywood. In short, at the beginning of 1946, we still feel that visiting the Moon Palace is just a fantasy. But in the future, there will always be a day when people set off to the Moon Palace and say, "Ah! This must be the best grand tour!" (English translation)</p>

<h3 id="e52">The Economic Value of Atomic Energy <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Zengjue</p>
<p>In order to promote research on the "atomic energy" issue, which is attracting worldwide attention, this newspaper has specially invited Mr. Zhao Zengjue to write a special essay on the above issue in simple and easy-to-understand language, to be published in installments. The first two articles have already been published in this newspaper on December 9th of last year and January 13th of this year, respectively. This is the third article. Further articles will be published in the weekly forum to stimulate public interest in discussion. (Editor)</p>
<p>I. The Basic Theorem of Atomic Energy Calculation</p>
<p>If the First World War can be said to be a chemical war, then undoubtedly the Second World War can be called a physical war. When we talk about chemistry, we know that the smallest indivisible unit of each simple element is the "atom." There are a total of ninety-two elements in the world. Mendeleev arranged them into a periodic table according to their atomic weight and properties, discovering that these elements have a natural order and regular chemical properties. To describe an atom, in addition to its name, there are two numbers that are very important: one is its relative weight, called "atomic weight," and the other is its position in the periodic table, called "atomic number." With these two numbers, we can identify a specific atom. It's like having "weight" and "age," it's not difficult to determine which older or younger brother it is. Among these ninety-two brothers, the heaviest is the eldest brother, uranium, with an atomic weight of 238 and an atomic number of 92. The lower the atomic number of the other brothers, the lighter the weight. These ninety-two brothers each have their own individual characteristics. In the late nineteenth century, it was proven that an atom is composed of a nucleus surrounded by electrons. The space between the nucleus and the surrounding electrons is filled with space, like planets orbiting the sun to form the solar system. The number of electrons surrounding the nucleus is equal to the "atomic number," so hydrogen has only one electron surrounding it, and uranium has ninety-two. We say that hydrogen's atomic number is one, and uranium's is ninety-two. These electrons surrounding the nucleus supply all chemical reactions, such as the burning of coal and the explosion of gunpowder, which are chemical manifestations.</p>
<p>What is now called atomic energy is actually "atomic nuclear energy," not the superficial electron energy. This "atomic nuclear energy" is extremely powerful, hidden in the nucleus, and is not easily released unless the nucleus is broken. It is a physical manifestation. Our main question is to study what exactly the atomic nucleus is and how it can be broken. In fact, the entire weight of an atom is concentrated within a very small area—the nucleus. The nucleus contains "protons" and "neutrons," which are extremely tightly bound together. Protons carry a positive charge, which cancels out the negative charge of the electrons surrounding the nucleus. Neutrons carry no charge at all and are completely neutral, with a weight similar to that of protons. Because neutrons carry no charge, they are the most difficult to control and are not affected by the electric field of the atomic nucleus. They were discovered last by scientists. If we use them as weapons to attack the atomic nucleus, it's like entering an uninhabited land. They are the main actors in the success of the atomic bomb! However, neutrons cannot be supplied naturally and can only be obtained by breaking down the atomic nucleus, which adds to our difficulty. But since the emergence of neutrons, a new concept of the atomic nucleus has been established. Take uranium, for example: the nucleus of uranium contains ninety-two protons and one hundred and forty-six neutrons, weighing two hundred and thirty-eight and carrying a charge of ninety-two.</p>
<p>The study of neutrons has attracted the attention of countless scientists. Physicists have discovered that neutrons with lower speeds are more useful than neutrons with higher speeds, because neutrons with high speeds quickly pass through matter and may not have any effect. However, neutrons with low speeds linger in between and often cause the transmutation of matter. The reason for this is easy to understand. For example, a bullet with a very high speed passes through the flesh of the human body, but it is not as effective as a bullet with a low speed that spins around in the flesh. Using low-speed neutrons to bombard the atomic nucleus will cause fission, which is another main cause of the atomic bomb. The use of atomic energy is to break the atomic nucleus by physical methods, so that the "energy" hidden within can be used by us. When breaking the atomic nucleus of a certain substance, it is necessary to choose the substance to be bombarded and new methods and weapons. In other words, the best weapon for breaking the atomic nucleus is a "neutron" with a lower speed, and the best substance to be bombarded is an unstable element. Uranium family elements are famously unstable elements and have long been regarded by scientists as something that can be utilized.</p>
<p>But according to the two laws of conservation of matter and conservation of energy, how can we create a large amount of "energy" out of thin air? As early as 1905, Einstein, as a result of his research on the theory of relativity, proved mathematically that matter and energy can be transformed into each other. The confirmation of this kind of transformation can be seen in radioactive substances, and it proves that radioactive energy is equal to the product of the mass unit multiplied by the square of the speed of light. If one kilogram of matter is completely converted into energy, it can produce 25 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, or 2150 trillion calories of heat. This astonishing number shows that matter is indeed a source of "energy." The question of matter transforming into energy was not previously noticed by people, but in the recent fifteen years, it has gradually been observed, tested, and confirmed by scientists with precision instruments. One is due to the invention of sophisticated instruments, and the other is due to the progress of atomic physics. Originally, the ninety-two elements in nature, including two hundred and fifty isotopes, are stable and not easy to open the nucleus. Therefore, we must search for or create new elements whose nuclei are easier to open, and then we can obtain atomic energy. In summary, atomic energy is not easy to obtain, requires strong technology, and costs huge amounts of money. Its economic value must be carefully studied.</p>
<p>II. The Value of Atomic Energy in Wartime</p>
<p>When studying radioactive materials, we have to study the uranium family, because its production is relatively abundant, about one million times that of radium. Uranium has isotopes such as U-238, U-235, and U-234. In ordinary natural uranium, U-238 accounts for 99.7%, U-235 accounts for about 0.3%, and U-234 is extremely rare. Among these three uranium family isotopes, the first can be called ordinary uranium. Its production is one hundred times more than the second. The second can be called uranium-235, which is relatively unstable, and its nucleus is relatively easy to break, which is the source of the explosion. Its chance of explosion is one hundred and eighty times more than ordinary uranium, so it is suitable for making atomic bombs. In February 1940, Professor Niel of the University of Minnesota used a mass spectrometer to separate U-238 and U-235 by using their different weights. Alternatively, the gaseous method can also be used to separate U-235 from U-238. Finally, pure uranium-235 was successfully extracted. The bomb made with this kind of uranium-235 may be the one dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, which is more expensive!</p>
<p>But scientists also want to study new materials that are cheaper and have more opportunities, so plutonium has also become a large-scale product through experiments. I mentioned earlier that physicists use neutrons to bombard uranium, hoping to discover atoms other than uranium. As a result, there were indeed two elements. The first is that ordinary uranium absorbs external neutrons and becomes a new element with an atomic number of 93, which is neptunium. Its nucleus contains ninety-two protons and one hundred and forty-seven neutrons, but it is too unstable and can be said to be an intermediate between ordinary uranium and plutonium. Soon, it emits two electrons, and the nucleus becomes ninety-four protons and one hundred and forty-five neutrons, and becomes plutonium. This element number 94—plutonium Pu239—can be separated from uranium-238 by chemical methods and processed separately, because its chemical properties are different from ordinary uranium. This element encounters external neutrons and undergoes fission, which can explode and produce a chain reaction—it is the big firework of the universe! When the new element—plutonium—is manufactured, because more abundant ordinary uranium can be used, the opportunity is one hundred and forty times more than the method of refining uranium-235 mentioned in the previous paragraph, and it can be separated by chemical methods, so it is more economical. The atomic bomb made with this new element is a little cheaper, maybe it is the bomb dropped on Nagasaki!</p>
<p>Up to now, the main materials that the United States has gathered countless scientists to study and can use atomic energy since 1940 can be summarized, and only the above two have been officially announced. One is uranium-235, and the other is plutonium-239. In the United States, with abundant resources and a large number of talents, the process was accelerated, lasting for five years and costing 2 to 3 billion US dollars. If it were not in wartime, and for the sake of winning the final victory, it would never have been so successful so quickly. And the most interesting thing is that, as far as we know, only three atomic bombs were actually used. The first was tested for the first time in New Mexico on July 16, 1945, the second was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, on August 6, and the third was dropped on Nagasaki, Japan, on August 10. Afterwards, on August 12, Japan unconditionally announced its surrender. Whether the United States has continued to manufacture atomic bombs since then is currently unknown, but in any case, it was these three atomic bombs that really helped us end this world war. Assuming that all the research and manufacturing costs are spread over these three atomic bombs, each one costs about 1 billion US dollars, and it ended this unprecedented massacre. Then the value of each 1 billion US dollar atomic bomb far exceeds the monetary cost! In any case, it is worth our spending. So, the value of atomic energy in wartime is undoubtedly.</p>
<p>III. The Economic Value of Atomic Energy in Peacetime</p>
<p>Next, we want to examine the economic value of atomic energy in peacetime. Before examining, we must consider the following points when using atomic energy: (1) the dangerousness of atomic energy radioactivity; (2) the weight and value of isolation radiation equipment; (3) the danger of possible explosions; (4) the possible lack of atomic energy raw material—uranium—which cannot continue to be supplied; (5) the government's strict control of atomic energy resources. If all of these can be resolved, we can use uranium-235 in two different ways: one is to use ordinary refined uranium-235, which requires a larger uranium pile, and the other is to use uranium-235 with a higher degree of refinement, which requires a more economical uranium pile, to generate the required heat energy for industrial applications. The so-called degree of refinement refers to the level of the uranium-235 content in the raw material. Usually, the reasonable uranium-235 content in industry can range from 1% to 15%. Now we might as well assume that using uranium-235 with a content of 10% is the standard raw material for industrial applications of atomic energy. When atomic energy is used, the first step is the utilization of heat. This heat generated by atomic energy can be transferred to water, air, or other fluids to drive internal combustion turbines or steam turbines to rotate generators or aircraft. In the future, using atomic energy as the power of missiles is the simplest range of application in the ideal.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to obtain the economic ratio of atomic energy in peacetime, the best way is to make a simple comparison between the "energy" that each pound of atomic energy raw material can produce and the price of coal or gasoline that produces the same amount of energy. We buy coal and gasoline not for coal or gasoline, but for "energy." We refine uranium-235 or plutonium not for uranium-235 or plutonium, but for "energy." Therefore, it is most appropriate and convenient to compare the price of coal or gasoline that produces the same amount of "energy" with the price of the standard uranium-235 that produces the same amount of energy. According to physicists' estimates, the heat energy generated by one pound of uranium-235 is equivalent to 11.4 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, which is equivalent to the electricity generated by the Shanghai Electric Power Company in one month in November of the 34th year. Assuming that an average of two pounds of coal generates one kilowatt-hour of electricity, then it is equivalent to 10,000 tons of coal. Now the official price of coal in Shanghai is about 15 US dollars per ton, then one pound of pure uranium-235, in order to compete with coal that produces the same amount of electricity, its cost cannot exceed 150,000 US dollars. If the refinement of uranium-235 is 10%, then each pound of this kind of uranium-235 should not exceed 15,000 US dollars, because it is easier to refine raw materials containing 10% uranium-235. This is of course the most rough estimate, but it can be seen that in order for the application of atomic energy in industry to have economic value, its cost should not exceed the above figures. If according to the cost of the atomic bomb, it is not easy to reach this figure! In order to require the cheapness of the cost, we must rely on the joint efforts of scientists and engineers, and then there is a possibility of practical use in industry. We hope that their hard work will be realized in the near future. (The End)</p>

<p>UNRRA Relocation</p>
<p>The number of staff transferred from Chongqing to Shanghai by the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is increasing daily, and the office space is insufficient. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), which shares office space with the Administration, has also decided to move to the Riverside Mansion in the middle of this month. After that, the entire former site of the Japanese Mitsui Corporation will be used by the Administration. Except for Deputy Director Xue Feng, who is in Chongqing presiding over the Administration's affairs and preparing to lead the remaining staff in Chongqing to return to the capital, almost all of the key staff of the Administration have come to Shanghai from Chongqing. Among those who recently arrived in Shanghai is Director Hu Keshi of the General Affairs Department. Before Director Hu arrived in Shanghai, the Shanghai General Affairs of the Administration was concurrently handled by Committee Member Nie Guangdi. It is now said that Mr. Nie has resigned from his concurrent position, and Director Hu is fully responsible for everything.</p>

<p>Work-Relief Project to Repair River Embankments</p>
<p>The Yangtze River embankment between Wuwei County and Hexian County in Anhui Province has been in disrepair for many years, and its collapse has caused great suffering to neighboring counties. The Anhui Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has decided to start repairing the embankment on the 20th of this month. The total length is over 240 Chinese miles. The Branch will implement a work-relief program, hiring 40,000 workers daily to rush the repair. One Chinese pound of flour will be issued for each cubic foot of repair. It is estimated that a total of 2.4 million workdays will be required. If the weather remains clear for 60 consecutive days, the entire repair project can be completed. According to a spokesman for the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the repair of the Wuhe section will benefit over 20,000 square kilometers of land and over 4 million people. The most dangerous project is the Huangsitan section, which affects seven counties: Sicheng, Lujiang, Wuwei, Chaoxian, Hefei, Hexian, and Hanshan.</p>

<h3 id="e66">Sheng Zhenwei Discusses Key Amendments to the New Company Law – Related to Regulations for Foreign Companies <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Regarding the revision and implementation of the Company Law, this reporter paid a special visit to Legislative Yuan member and drafting committee member of the new Company Law, Mr. Sheng Zhenwei. He stated that in addition to himself, Legislative Yuan members Zhang Zhaoyuan and Sun Jiulu were also on the drafting committee. The new Company Law has a total of 361 articles and was originally scheduled to be implemented on January 1st of this year. However, due to some</p>
<p>minor opinions</p>
<p>from British and American business circles, the matter was submitted by the Supreme National Defense Council to the Legislative Yuan for further review and revision. Mr. Sheng has been in Shanghai for over a month and is not fully aware of the details of the revisions. However, he believes that the revisions are largely related to the regulations for foreign companies. It is reported that Article 7 of the new Company Law stipulates: "The term 'foreign company' as used in this law refers to a company that is organized and registered for profit-making purposes in accordance with foreign law or chartered by a foreign government, and which has been recognized by the Chinese government and operates within the territory of China." The original intention of the legislation was based on the fact that in the past,</p>
<p>foreign companies</p>
<p>established in our country often had no business to speak of in their home countries. The establishment of these foreign companies in our country was based on the China Trade Act in the United States, and the commercial regulations promulgated by the Hong Kong government in the UK. All regulations were more convenient and simpler than the company laws of their home countries. Therefore, they often simply hung up a foreign company license in our country or claimed to be registered abroad and then called themselves a foreign company. Now the new Company Law stipulates that one of the conditions for a foreign company in China is that it must have business operations in its home country. It is now said that the revised Company Law may remove the word "business operations." Other matters, such as foreign companies being able to</p>
<p>purchase real estate</p>
<p>in our country, are also said to be revised, but it is claimed that this regulation is of a reciprocal nature. It was once said that the re-revised Company Law would be implemented on March 1st of this year, but now it is said that it may be delayed again because the government is urgently preparing to move the capital.</p>

<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau convened a joint meeting at the Municipal Government Building yesterday morning with leading personnel from the Health Bureau, Public Utilities Bureau, and Waterworks to discuss issues such as the disposal of sewage and ditches. According to the report of the engineer from the Ditch and Canal Engineering Department of the Bureau, the water quality of the Suzhou Creek and the Shajing River is extremely poor based on water sample tests, to the extent that fish cannot survive. This is due to the accumulation of garbage dumped on both banks over the years. The poor water quality affects the city's drinking water and harms the health of the citizens. The Health Bureau is now seeking ways to prevent garbage from being dumped. Other matters concerning the inspection of well water in the city and the dredging of rivers are being actively promoted by relevant agencies, and it is also planned to request assistance from the Dredging Bureau and the Naval Authorities.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Litan Nathan Re-Examined - Zou Xiangzhi Denies Wrongdoing <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Litan Nathan, the Lithuanian owner of the former DiDi's Café on Jing'an Temple Road, was accused of serving as an informant for the Japanese Kenpeitai (military police) during the period of enemy occupation, selling firearms for them, and detaining the Cuban Luo Shengbang. He had previously been questioned once. The defendant firmly denied the charges, claiming that his business operations over the years had nothing to do with the Japanese, and that he himself had been detained twice by the Japanese Kenpeitai. The case was re-examined yesterday by Liu Yugui, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division of the High Court. The victim, Luo Shengbang, testified in court: He knew Litan Nathan and was arrested by the Japanese Kenpeitai in 1940, accused of being a Soviet spy. After suffering various tortures, he was sentenced to four years in prison and imprisoned in Shanghai Prison until he was released last year. Because Nathan was involved with the Japanese Kenpeitai, he suspected that it was Nathan who reported him. He then presented a certificate proving Nathan's service in the Kenpeitai and claimed that he could produce witnesses to prove it next time. After questioning the witness produced by the defendant, the Russian Stasichigo, the court ordered a hearing for debate on the morning of the 14th.</p>

He also served as a detective in the Special Higher Section of the Tongfu Road Police Station, where he committed many evil deeds. After the victory, he was reported, arrested, and transferred to the court. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu opened the court for questioning. The defendant stated: He was engaged in the electric light and wireless radio business. At that time, because the roads were sometimes blocked, he nominally served as a detective in the bureau for the sake of convenient work, but he did not commit any evil deeds. He also hired lawyer Huang Xiubo to defend him. The court adjourned for another hearing at a later date.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] Lieutenant Cook, a medical officer of the US Navy's Seventh Fleet, recently returned to Shanghai from Chongqing. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, he hosted Chinese and foreign reporters on the fifth floor of the Cathay Hotel to report on his visit to various facilities of the Ministry of Health of the Executive Yuan in Chongqing on the 4th of this month. He highly praised China's public health.</p>
<p>Perfect Equipment at the Chongqing Ministry of Health</p>
<p>Lieutenant Cook said that today's China has the best public health organization in the world, and there are also many well-trained doctors. The Ministry of Health in Chongqing is fully equipped, and its achievements in bacterial testing and food and drug inspection are excellent. It also produces its own DDT solution and soy milk powder, the nourishing ingredients of which are no less than those of cow's milk. In addition, it conducted a survey on lung diseases and found that 50% of students in Chongqing are suspected of having lung diseases.</p>
<p>Health Education Should Be Actively Promoted</p>
<p>Lieutenant Cook particularly praised the Ministry of Health's promotion of public health education. He said that the most important point in implementing public health is to educate the people, instill medical knowledge, and make them aware of the importance of hygiene so that they can protect their health. This is an especially important responsibility for those engaged in news reporting. The Chinese people are often influenced by various superstitions, such as religion, and neglect proper treatment. Lieutenant Cook believes that future doctors and nurses in China should be trained within the country. Hiring foreign medical leaders can only be responsible for guidance and advice and should not engage in practical work.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Actively Prevent Infectious Diseases <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>– Ping Xiao</p>
<p>As winter ends and spring arrives, it is again the time when infectious diseases start. The Health Bureau has already taken various preventive steps.</p>
<p>Chen Bangxian, Director of the Epidemic Prevention Department of the Health Bureau, said: "Diphtheria, smallpox, and meningitis have been discovered in this city. The number of patients was highest a month ago, but it has now been greatly reduced. The reasons for the occurrence of infectious diseases this winter are: First, the weather was abnormal last winter, as warm as spring; second, the situation of infectious diseases in other ports such as Hankou was quite serious, and some travelers inevitably brought some germs to Shanghai. But the most active time for infectious diseases is always spring. After this great war, citizens should really prevent them as early as possible."</p>
<p>The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has helped the Health Bureau a lot. Their medical experts often hold meetings with the Bureau to formulate practical plans for the Bureau to adopt. UNRRA also provided some vaccines and penicillin, and recently prepared to send a large car, specially prepared for the Health Bureau to rush to disinfect after an epidemic has occurred. The Health Bureau is working hard to improve efficiency, so they are trying to reduce the "circular of official documents" and strive for agility. If the infected patients are in poor condition, then all medical and other expenses will be waived. The current trend of epidemics is not yet serious. If it slowly becomes rampant, the Health Bureau plans to cooperate with the baojia (community security system) to implement compulsory vaccination.</p>
<p>Because of epidemic prevention, we talked about tap water. Director Chen said: Now the water company still regularly sends water samples for inspection, and the results are quite satisfactory. However, sometimes the water source of the company is very clean, but when it is distributed to people, it becomes dirty because the water pipes have been in disrepair for a long time. This kind of inspection is very difficult. Moreover, most epidemics occur in poor areas, and in these places, residents only drink well water because tap water is too expensive. Now the Health Bureau has begun to inspect those wells, and if they are considered unsanitary, they will immediately close the wells. The Health Bureau is currently trying to reduce the price of tap water to a very low level so that everyone can afford it.</p>
<p>Shanghai's garbage is also a problem for the Health Bureau. Not counting Pudong, the city center, and other places, Shanghai has 1,900 tons of garbage every day. Now the Health Bureau has 29 garbage trucks and 1,500 handcarts (only 800 of which are intact), which is really not enough. According to Director Chen's estimate, we need at least 100 garbage trucks to clear all this garbage every day.</p>

<p>In the Shanghai Tram Company labor dispute, the Social Affairs Bureau invited representatives of the workers on the 7th to state their opinions and invited representatives of the employers on the 8th to state their opinions. The opinions of both parties were quite close.</p>
<p>Preliminary Review Is Very Solemn</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Utilities Bureau consulted on handling methods and reviewed the company's various articles of association and forms. The Social Affairs Bureau sent Section Chief Zhang Zhenyuan, and the Public Utilities Bureau sent representative Li Kaidi, to conduct a preliminary review. Director Wu Kaixian personally reviewed the review, which was very solemn. He also consulted with Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau on handling methods, and made thorough discussions on each of the conditions proposed by the employees and the recent opinions of both parties. According to Section Chief Zhang's interview with reporters, the negotiation of the labor dispute has reached a good stage. It is expected that a meeting of labor and management will be convened tomorrow, and a satisfactory result is expected.</p>
<p>Employer Representatives Refuse to Attend</p>
<p>The Cantonese cuisine labor dispute is still deadlocked and has not been resolved. The Social Affairs Bureau scheduled a meeting of labor and management at 2:00 PM yesterday to continue the negotiations at the Social Affairs Bureau. The labor representatives Zhu Gang, Zhang Ronghua representing the "Shanbang" (mountain gang) of the restaurant industry, Shen Jinsong representing the "Benbang" (local gang), Zhang Zhenyun representing the "Xibang" (Tin gang), He Yicheng representing the "Subang" (Suzhou gang), Sun Shunian representing the "Chuanyangbang" (Sichuan and Yangzhou gang), and Zhu Shifa representing the Western Cuisine group, all arrived at the Social Affairs Bureau on time. The employer representatives did not arrive. According to reporter inquiries, a certain representative of the employers sent a letter to Section Chief Zhang, stating that the conditions proposed by the workers were too high and the employers could not accept them. Before the labor-management negotiations were close, please slow down the mediation, so they did not intend to participate in the mediation meeting. This action is in fact an expression of the employers' refusal to mediate. In order to take into account the convenience of the public's diet and the stability of the society, the Social Affairs Bureau will submit a mediation decision on the 11th, ordering labor and management to comply.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Speculators Stir Up Trouble - "Fried Yellow" Soars - Silver Shops' Absorption Power Is Also Not Small <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, "fried yellow" (gold speculation) was like a galloping horse, with almost all obstacles removed. People generally have an unbelievably high view of US exchange rates and gold. Speculators did whatever they wanted. Floating funds moved from stocks to gold. In the afternoon, the over-the-counter price was shouted up to 1.42 million. It was found that the opening price in the morning immediately rose to 1.305 million, following the momentum of the previous day. After opening, it hovered around the 1.30 million mark. Large players wanted to lure and then capture, first advancing and then retreating. In a flash, it pulled up to 1.35 million. Sichuan banks still had supply for sale at high prices, and after the price increase, it gradually stabilized. Northern banks also came to spit out overnight floating profits. It once fell back to 1.29 million. With the absorption of silver shops, it was pulled up again. The afternoon close was 1.34 million, a sharp increase of 94,000 compared to the previous close. In the afternoon, the shouted price gradually increased, the supply was limited, and the buying trend was rekindled. Floating funds gathered in gold and banknotes from all directions. Under the circumstances of something actually happening, rumors sang even higher. Next-day delivery (next Monday) traded as high as around 1.42 million, then retreated to 1.38 million, and finally closed around 1.40 million. Gold jewelry was listed at 148,000, silver at 1,300, and silver dollars rose to over 800 yuan. The dark exchange rate ranged from 1.2 cents to 1.4 cents.</p>
<p>US Dollars Gradually Rising</p>
<p>People generally believe that the listed price of US dollars at 2,000 to 1 is too low, and speculation is expected to rise further. As a result, buyers are extremely eager. At the same time, gold jumped sharply. Those who did not get gold rushed to buy dollars. Arbitragers came in droves, at a difference of 730 yuan per ten taels. The supply of US dollar chips, which had been loosening in the coming days, suddenly became tight. The opening price was 1,780 yuan, and it rose from 1,760 yuan to 1,840 yuan in the middle, and then hovered around 1,800 yuan. The afternoon close was 1,830 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose with the gold market and was shouted up to 1,930 yuan before slightly falling back. As a result, it jumped 130 yuan compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong dollar environment helped buyers. Those who profited from gold stocks sought second best, resulting in a wide range of buyers for both new and old dollars. As a result, in the chaotic situation, old dollars rose 50 yuan, and new dollars rose 20 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Large Players Emerge, Both Chinese and Foreign Stocks Fall Together <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were extremely charming in the middle of yesterday, with large players raising prices to facilitate their exit. After many twists and turns, they finally fell from a high level.

Afterwards, they were all slightly pulled up, but the unpopular stocks did not have time to recover after falling due to time constraints. As a result, the yarn factory fell slightly compared to the previous close, Mayor was flat, and the three small hot stocks were about 3 yuan higher. The rise and fall of unpopular stocks were mixed.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks also coexisted and prospered with Chinese stocks, first rising and then falling. In the end, the market price gradually reached saturation. Those who profited stopped with satisfaction, and the rising trend seemed to wait for an opportunity to come again. Eves retreated from 6,800 yuan to 6,100 yuan, and the afternoon close was 6,500 yuan, down 100 yuan compared to the previous close.

<p>Although government bonds saw high prices again yesterday, major players in the industry, observing activity in the gold market, rushed to convert their bonds into gold, leading to a temporary peak of 2,410 yuan for Type C bonds. This proved fleeting as major players aggressively sold after entering the market, causing the midday price to fall below 2,200 yuan. Consequently, compared to the previous close, Types A, B, and C each fell by 10 yuan, Type D by 18 yuan, and Type E by 50 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, foreign paper continued to rise under the influence of gold prices. A recent investigation revealed that some overseas orders have indeed been shipped, but these are not new orders placed after the war, but rather goods loaded before December 8th that were in transit in the Pacific. It is reported that American manufacturers are mostly hesitant to accept orders easily because the exchange rate with China has not been determined. Therefore, the issue of orders that has been discussed in the city for several months is extremely minor, and the high price of goods may also be due to this. However, transactions are still scarce.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Fuel Committee, in order to encourage merchants and residents to transport foreign coal to suppress rising coal prices, has formulated four measures for importing foreign coal, which have been approved by President Song. The measures are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Merchants and residents are allowed to freely transport foreign coal, except for Annam coal.</p>
<p>(2) When necessary, merchants and residents who transport foreign coal may request the Committee to issue a certificate, so as to request an export license from foreign countries. When the ship is allowed to import, the Committee will provide a certificate to the Customs to complete customs clearance.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Commercial Summary <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Dyeing and weaving factories are searching for 12-pound white unbleached fine cloth to prepare for dyeing blue cloth and Indanthrene Blue, but the market inventory is very weak.</p>
<p>Melon seeds, red dates, and black dates are all in short supply, and shipments are scarce. Transit trade along the Hangzhou-Jiaxing line and Hong Kong is still active, and prices are tightening.</p>
<p>Amidst the rising prices of everything else, saccharin and quinine have reached new high prices as a result of the price increases in Western medicine. Caustic soda rose sharply again, and manufacturers' demand remains strong. Those who have goods are refusing to sell, and prices are seen to be rising rapidly.</p>
<p>Due to the rising gold prices in recent days, which has stirred up public sentiment, holders of various cotton textile goods are unwilling to sell. The local sales channels in this city are still strong, and there is some interest in purchasing. The price of 32-count socks is rising the most strongly. The price of 3901 Goose Brand undershirts has fallen compared to yesterday due to retail sellers releasing their inventory.</p>
<p>With red gold rising daily, all kinds of daily necessities are also rising. Retail buyers are adding to their purchases, but sellers are very reluctant to sell. Soap, matches, and foreign candles have all reached new high prices. Sales of British-American Tobacco Company cigarettes are relatively smooth, and prices are firm. Among Chinese-made cigarettes, except for the slight increase in Dagaole and Baiwanjin, the rest are stable.</p>
<p>Cosmetics factories rarely sell, and merchants in the industry generally consider holding goods to be the best strategy, so prices are rising.</p>

<p>[Report from This City] Jin Rizhang, the principal of the private Zijiang Elementary School in this city, did not renew the contracts of five teachers, including Luo Shuxiu, at the end of last semester, which has caused a great uproar. The Elementary School Teachers Occupational Security Promotion Association and others have risen up to support them. After a group of more than a thousand people petitioned the Municipal Education Bureau the day before yesterday, Gu Yuxiu, the Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, invited representatives from both sides and relevant organizations to hold an arbitration meeting in the bureau's auditorium at 2 p.m. yesterday. The meeting had not reached a resolution by 7 p.m. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Director's Address</p>
<p>Gu Yuxiu, the Director of the Education Bureau, delivered a speech first, stating that both principals and teachers are working hard for the sacred cause of education, and should have a spirit of sharing weal and woe. Both sides should have a spirit of the rule of law regarding school measures, and all words and deeds must be reasonable. Regarding the Zijiang Elementary School's failure to renew the contracts of teachers, he hoped that they could arbitrate together so as to achieve a satisfactory solution.</p>
<p>Reports from Both Sides</p>
<p>Next, the parties concerned gave reports. The teacher representative Ren Yuying first described the process of not being rehired. Then, Principal Jin Rizhang reported the reasons for not renewing the contracts of the teachers, claiming that Luo Shuxiu had broken the head of student Sun Defu with a stone inkstone, Jiang Shumei arbitrarily dismissed classes, Han Liming was willful and had poor teaching skills, and Chen Lanying and Ren Yuying repeatedly refused school guidance and neglected their duties.</p>
<p>Representatives' Opinions</p>
<p>After listening to the reports from both sides, Director Gu asked the teachers' side if they had any objections to the reasons stated by the principal for not renewing the contracts. Each teacher then briefly reported on their usual service situation and gave some explanations for the points pointed out by the principal. Then, the representative of the Elementary School Teachers Occupational Security Promotion Association spoke, hoping that the above-mentioned teachers could continue to be hired. Representatives from the Joint Association of Primary and Secondary Schools and the Municipal Education Association also spoke in succession, hoping that the principal and teachers could coordinate, but teachers with serious faults might as well be asked to change their environment, so as to benefit both sides.</p>
<p>Direct Negotiations</p>
<p>Finally, Director Gu earnestly expressed that he would find a way to arrange for the teachers who were not rehired to be placed in municipal schools, and individually asked each teacher whether they were willing to accept this. At that time, because the representative of the Occupational Security Association had other opinions, no decision was reached. Therefore, Director Gu summoned the parties concerned to the bureau office again for direct consultation, but there was no result. Therefore, it was decided to continue discussing the matter next Monday and be sure to find a fair solution.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Zijiang Elementary School Board of Directors has recently decided to extend the employment of four of the five dismissed teachers. The Shenjiang Elementary School Board of Directors has also decided to reopen the school.</p>

<p>The first act of the Mayor's Cup football preliminary was held at Jiaozhou Park at 3 p.m. yesterday, with Longjie playing against the British Navy. As a result, Longjie, with its second-tier team, was able to eliminate the British Navy by a score of three to one. The score was two to zero in the first half. However, Longjie's actions during the match yesterday were quite inappropriate. The up-and-coming team should be cautious.</p>
<p>Ten minutes after the start of the match, Longjie's Gu Dirong had a good opportunity and scored a goal. Soon, Gu Dirong scored another goal. The British army tried repeatedly to counterattack without success. The score was 2 to 0 in the first half, with Longhua taking the lead. In the second half, the offensive was still controlled by the British Navy, but they could not find their way in for a long time. Longjie's Gu Dirong made a central breakthrough and scored again, taking an absolute advantage of 3 to 0. The British Navy made every effort to counterattack, and Williams finally headed in a goal. The British Navy was finally eliminated, and Longjie was promoted to the next level. The score was three to one.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Constructing Dramatic Culture (Part 1) <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Shaohua</p>
<p>——From Emperor Ming of Tang to Confucius——</p>
<p>In the past, our nation's drama circles worshiped an ancestral master, said to be Mr. Li Longji, Emperor Ming of the Tang Dynasty. In his later years, Emperor Ming of Tang grew weary of politics and knew well how to seek noble entertainment, even leading a troupe of Pear Garden disciples in performing plays himself. However, in the entirety of his life, his relationship with drama was not very close. If one were to speak of someone close to drama, it should be another Li – Emperor Zhuangzong of the Later Tang Dynasty. He was an emperor who was a complete and thorough performer, spending his life acting and being cremated with musical instruments after his death. However, he lived slightly later and could not catch up with Emperor Ming of Tang in terms of being revered.</p>
<p>Performing was definitely not a profession in primitive times. However, after drama became a specialized occupation, those engaged in it were always in a disadvantageous position. Despite later performers calling themselves Pear Garden disciples or students of the emperor, in terms of their profession, they could never escape the fate of "serving others with their looks and talents." This fixed fate clearly had a master-slave distinction. Emperor Ming of Tang's leadership of the Pear Garden was nothing more than training a group of more satisfactory slaves for his own enjoyment. When slaves forget their own personality and instead make him a master and a god, it is no wonder that later Pear Garden disciples are universally regarded as actors.</p>
<p>Other Tang Ming Emperors, whether named Li or not, are those who, from ancient times to the present, have had relationships with actors from a perspective of entertainment. Although these people are not emperors, they all have the same psychology as Emperor Ming of Tang. Their love and appreciation of actors is based on the relationship between actors performing and them deriving entertainment. Beyond this, they do not know what acting is, and what reason there is for acting to exist other than to provide entertainment. Emperor Ming of Tang certainly did not specially set up a troupe of performers to satirize himself because he lacked people's satirical advice. At the same time, performers who revered Emperor Ming of Tang as their ancestral master were afraid of not pleasing their superiors and therefore engaged in performing. This kind of relationship constitutes an industry similar to "selling laughter," so the status of its practitioners cannot help but fall into a disadvantageous position.</p>
<p>Now, to invigorate and extricate ourselves, the best method is to first overthrow the Tang Ming Emperor, overthrow thousands and millions of Tang Ming Emperors. Anyone who teaches someone to serve others with their looks and talents, or who specializes in using other people's looks and talents for their own enjoyment, is a Tang Ming Emperor and should be overthrown! Destroy the idol of the Tang Ming Emperor and then, from the industry itself, strengthen the effect of satire—isn't everyone singing loudly now that drama is education?</p>
<p>Speaking of education, our nation's education circles in the past also worshiped an ancestral master, who was the Sage Confucius.</p>
<p>In fact, Confucius is not only the god of education, but his relationship with drama is even closer because he once advocated a dramatic education movement. Even earlier than Confucius, there may have been the Duke of Zhou, who also deeply recognized the value of drama. However, due to the remoteness of the era and the uncertainty of the existence of writings, the discussion of this field of knowledge is not as detailed and clear as what Confucius advocated.

<h3 id="e111">Silhouettes of Theater People in the Rear <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Tie Mei</p>
<p>Shi Ruilin</p>
<p>She loves to talk about her student life, and she is most proud of her daring and outstanding skills of riding a bicycle in the city of Beiping. She cannot forget those playful and laughing years, which are everyone's favorite childhood.</p>
<p>She is a student at an art school, specializing in sculpting. Every day she is seen with a pair of muddy hands, and her room is full of piles of mud. When sculpting, she often likes to transform the shapes of others to fit her "ideal of beauty." But others do not understand this, and she often gets so angry that she smashes her favorite statues into pieces. However, when she sees that the shattered mud is beyond saving, she cries sadly and regretfully. This is an interesting personality, and it can also be said to be because she is too loyal to her own ideals.</p>
<p>After the fall of Beiping, she lived a painful life for many years. An active personality did not allow her to stay any longer. She loves acting, and acting often cannot but remind people of the motherland and freedom. So, she resolutely left her home with her father, mother, brother, and sister, and went to the Great Rear Area. When she arrived in Chongqing and saw the lively and vigorous theater life, especially the noble goal of acting for freedom and the people, she deeply loved it. Because the starting point was so beautiful and correct, she became an actress with the best temperament on stage. As long as she can take on a role, she is happy to work hard to study and perform it.</p>
<p>After arriving in the rear area, in a few years, she has acted in many plays, and each character shows her unique insights. In "The Model Teacher for All Generations," she will play an interesting and humorous character. At that time, the audience in Shanghai will deeply remember her name.</p>
<p>Zhang Yan</p>
<p>Zhang Yan comes from the northwest plateau, his body as strong as a calf, his face showing a bright red color. He comes from a long way away, and when you look at his forward-looking pace, he is like a patriot stepping on a bloody path, opening up a future for mankind. That image will always leave you with a calm impression.</p>
<p>His wildness is not only seen in his fiery eyes and rugged face but also felt in his voice, which is full of life. Perhaps it is because he is such a simple and strong character that when he performs such characters, you especially feel a compelling force.</p>
<p>I remember that when he played the ghost in "Hamlet," everyone was chased by his soul-stirring voice of revenge and felt terror. The entire stage was filled with dark clouds and flames, what a tragic and cruel scene!</p>
<p>His wildness also makes him like living in the wild, liking the sun, and liking to sing to his heart's content. The young lad, how happy he is living!</p>
<p>He has acted in many plays, Yue Fei is one of his best plays, Zeng Hao in "Peking Man," and Hao Shunfeng in "The Big Circus" have all received praise. This is an actor who has already achieved success, especially in his life and attitude towards art, not counting fame or profit, but only an honesty and straightforwardness. He can be a good friend to people, and he can flip tables and kick benches because of other people's mistakes and selfishness. All of this comes from their simplicity and "wildness," and I also hope that he will always maintain such a naive heart.</p>
<h3 id="e112">The Actions of Farce <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Yu</p>
<p>Once I was taking a tram home, and all the seats in the carriage were full. Diagonally opposite me sat a well-dressed, short middle-aged man. Next to him was a large, burly White Russian woman. After sitting down, this neatly dressed little man quickly glanced at the White Russian woman, then quickly busied himself arranging his Zhongshan suit coat. Then he turned around in his seat to take out money to give to the ticket seller, skillfully clipping the coupon book between his right index and ring fingers. He turned around again to put the change back into his pocket, patting it lightly to make sure it was safe. Then he rearranged his Zhongshan suit coat and sat down properly. After only a few seconds, he started moving around in his seat again. This time he took out an eyeglass case and a white handkerchief. He took out his gold-rimmed glasses, turned around to put the eyeglass case back, and then used the large handkerchief to wipe the lenses clean. Then he put on the glasses and wiped his forehead and nose with the handkerchief before turning around again to put the large handkerchief back. Once again, he rearranged his Zhongshan suit coat and sat down properly. Two seconds later, he moved his arm to adjust its position, and at the same time used the thumb of his left hand to turn the dark purple gemstone on the ring on his left ring finger...</p>
<p>His actions were continuous, endless, and fast, flexible, and impeccable. While he was busying himself like a fly, the large, burly White Russian woman sitting next to him was overwhelmed and unbearable. She first showed an impatient look, which had no effect. Then she glared fiercely once or twice, which still had no effect. Finally, taking advantage of the fact that the person next to me got off, she suddenly moved over and sat next to me. At that time, the little man was reaching into his pocket, engaging in another round of vigorous activity.</p>
<p>I quietly observed and couldn't help but admire him greatly because this wonderful performance by the middle-aged little man and the White Russian woman was very comedic. Especially the agile and busy middle-aged little man is of reference value. Because his every move is clear, fast, rich, complete, infinitely varied, and breathtaking. This is really a good model for the actions of farce!</p>
<h3 id="e113">The Art of Speaking <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Qing</p>
<p>Our people do not pay much attention to the art of speaking. This is mostly because after Qin completed the feudal autocracy, it strictly forbade the people of the world to speak casually. The feudal monarchs of successive dynasties continued to promote such harsh laws. Therefore, the Chinese language has not been able to develop. To recreate the lost art of speaking that has been lost for more than two thousand years would be of great help to the progress of China's new culture. In other words, one of the tasks of the New Culture Movement is to recreate China's language and the art of speaking.</p>
<p>The problem of language on stage is particularly serious. Usually what is written on paper cannot be read, and at the same time, what can be said is difficult to write. Therefore, at present, spoken drama can only adopt a kind of "vernacular," which is not spoken language. This characteristic of writing is only closer to spoken language than classical Chinese, but it is limited. To a certain extent, it becomes as stubborn and rigid as classical Chinese, unwilling to conform to the spoken word. This is because Chinese characters have not yet reached the stage of phoneticization and are still square characters and monosyllabic characters.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Zhang Junxiang, the play "Romeo and Juliet" only takes two and a half hours to perform abroad, while it takes four hours to perform in Chongqing, excluding the time spent changing scenery. This is because Chinese language always has several pauses in a short sentence, while foreign languages can use the convenience of consonants and vowels to speak very quickly.</p>
<p>Speaking of "Romeo and Juliet," I am interested in the performance of this poetic drama with many rhymes. I really don't know how the actors of "China Electricity" at that time overcame the inherent defects of our country's language? In my estimation, many witty homophones are simply too difficult to convey the original meaning. For example, in Act 3, Scene 5, Juliet talks to her mother about the death of her cousin and the murderer Romeo, saying the following:</p>
<p>Juliet (pun):</p>
<p>Indeed, I can't reach him.</p>
<p>I hope it is I, myself, who avenges my cousin.</p>
<p>Or, like the following sentences:</p>
<p>Juliet (rushes out):</p>
<p>Truly, I will never be satisfied with Romeo unless I see him dead—my heart is so sad for my cousin.</p>
<p>As for performing comedies, our country's actors always suffer losses. Recently, I watched several comedy performances. The tone of "Youthful Wanderings" was leisurely and unrestrained, and the actors' recitation speed was still passable. "Miaofeng Mountain" was bright and relaxed, but I felt that most of the actors were very heavy and strenuous, unable to be fast or light. According to the results of the investigation, the performance took three and a half hours, half an hour slower than the first performance.</p>
<p>It can be seen that the reconstruction of the art of speaking is a matter of great significance!</p>

<h3 id="e114">A Faithful Reader's Accusation: Even Well-to-Do Families are Receiving Aid, Hoping All Parties Will Work Together to Benefit the Truly Poor <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Editor Sir: The winter vacation is about to pass, and the new semester is imminent. Tuition fees for the next semester are indeed a serious problem for parents with economic difficulties. Fortunately, there are righteous acts such as education loans and scholarships, which allow young people who have dropped out of school to regain the opportunity to study. Their contribution to society and the nation is truly not small. However, often there are many people who have ample resources at home but still apply for scholarships. I have a relative who does just that. Every day, they take their elderly and young children to listen to operas and watch plays, even watching the afternoon performance and rushing to the night performance. They buy jewelry and lend money at interest, but they still apply for scholarships. Isn't this depriving truly poor students of their opportunity to study? At the same time, it also violates the purpose of scholarships and is even unfair to the many benefactors who are enthusiastically helping students. This matter concerns the public, so I hope that the authorities in charge can strictly review the students applying for scholarships and not allow a group of truly poor students to lose the opportunity to study. At the same time, I have heard that civil servants in general state-owned enterprises all have a portion of scholarships for their children, so many more can be reduced among loan students, and more orphans or destitute outstanding students can be rescued. Yang Mei Qing respectfully submits</p>
<p>I admire Mr. Yang's opinion very much! It is inevitable that students' parents have a kind of immoral behavior, the most shameless style. This newspaper has also encountered many of the same facts in handling scholarships over the years. Therefore, in addition to asking the principals of each school to be responsible for recommending and spot-checking family circumstances, we also ask the students who receive assistance to secretly investigate and report as much as possible. If it is indeed a well-to-do family receiving aid, not only will their qualifications be revoked, but their secrets will also be exposed in the newspaper to show a slight punishment! This time, this newspaper is cooperating with the Shanghai Education Loan Committee, and we are also paying close attention to this point. We hope that faithful readers will assist us from the sidelines and report the facts as much as possible. At the same time, we hope that the students and parents who are applying will release their conscience and not encroach on the rights of students who are indeed poor. This is as meritorious as donating your own money. (Editor)</p>
