<h3>負起責任改進政治從速完成華北復員主席在平市紀念週訓話</h3>
<p>〔本報北平二日電〕蔣主席二日仍留平，繼續召見各部門長官，二日午十一時各機關特提早一日舉行據大紀念週，請主席親臨訓話，會後赴北平行營視察，少頃返行轅，下午三時起，召見經部特派員王冀臣等經濟部人員，四時召見北平行營參謀長王鴻韶，秘書長漩一山，政務處長王捷三，十一戰區參謀長宋肯堂，副參謀長呂文貞，高松元，政治部主任趙可夫，平警局副局長祝難平等致訓，晚有茶會邀在平士紳名流及來賓相見，由潘趕回北平之頭維鉤，特往招待。記者見主席以藍筆圈定准予明晟接見之名單，有萬福麟，馬占山，馮欽哉，及李守信。又張自忠夫人亦准於明晨晋見主席及夫人。主席在平行動，周密而迅速，短短數日，各方面均顧到，行轅各室裝有電鈴，隨員承受時準備行動，鈴嚮九分鍾内，即出發。</p>
<p>〔本報北平二日電〕將主席二日出席平市昨時擴大紀念週，對華北政治多所指示、要點為（一）平津軍政步驟事檻具頗零亂，以後應力求統一，請行營李主任負起責任。（二）政風亟應革新，變消極為積積，以求功之心代無過之心。（三）平津接收工作過於零亂，且不多合理現象，致今後應澈底清查，高級長官每人只准享有住屋五間。（四）過去附逆要員，須查辦。（五）市府須注意市民健康，健全公共衛生，全市積土速予清除。（六）警察局員警良　不齊，應謀改進，警政經費，中央將予增加，訓話歴一小時。二日黨政軍熱運動大紀念週，係在中南海悵仁堂舉行，出席平津保黨政軍部人員二百餘人，孫連中於上午九時即到場照料，十一時蔣主席由李宗仁陪同李隋員蒞臨，主席戒裝，外軍大　，神採奕奕，全體人員於主席蒞場時，起立向主席致敬，主席欣然答禮，繼即由主席主持開會，十二時許散會。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平二日電〕北平黨政軍警各界，於今日上午十一時在懷仁堂舉行聯合總理紀念週，蔣主席領導行禮如儀後，即席訓詞，首調北平為全國最重要都市之一，各同志在此工作，應知本身責任之重大，目前華北之復員工作，因經濟之困難，交通這梗阻，致進行不如預期，然吾人在可能範圍內，必須自動設法打破困難，必須有愈挫愈奮不畏艱難困苦之精神，然後乃能於破壞之餘，完成建國大業。蔣主席繼指出目前一般公務人員不求有功，但求無過之心理，實勞任怨，然後事務乃推動。主席最後對平市之經濟、教育、衛生、警察各方面，均有具體之指示，尤以衛生一項，認為必須由警局協助，發動民眾，自動清除積機，請求清潔，乃能攻效，訓詞約歴四十分鍾。</p>

<h3>首批川糧抵京</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕局為解除京瀘糧荒，會談令糧食部將川省賒糧運京安濟，茲愁首批川糧二百二十順，已於昨日下午六時由氏福民裕民　三輪，裝運抵京，同時尚有復都人員一批來京。</p>
<h3>國家屆盛衰榮杜關頭　　大局已不能再拖　　政協會決議須徒速實行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕據某要員告本報記者，依據過去一週這關內外各種消息觀察，目前最堪注意者，已非所謂和戰問題，而為中國本身之國家盛衰榮杜問題，中國民眾之生死存亡問題。吾人應知，自勝利以後，共當為險謀攫奪政權計，先後在關內外毀路，擴軍，破壞工礦生產，阻撓政府復員整軍，恢復交通，致使各地生產衰落，物價飛漲，造成今日國內經濟上之戰車危機，甚至公然逞兵，阻撓政府接機，盤踞中長鐵路沿綫，假借民意，盜竊政權，不僅妨害政府履行中蘇友好同盟條約第四條中蘇共有共營中國長春鐵路之義務，且使被敵偽壓迫十四年之久之東北數千萬同胞，因交通破壞，工廠停頓，重陷絕境。政府過去雖一再委屈求全，召開協商會議，共謀國是以求和平，無奈共當禍心深藏，陽示和平，陰謀籰奪，對協商會議議決各事，如停戰復路，如加國大會議，同意政府改組，背信連令，反覆無常，實令人無可揣測，其用心無非是翻雲覆雨之陰毒手腕，以達成拖延現局之目的，將國家拖得支防破碎，將政府拖得精疲力竭，將民眾將入苦難的深淵，将熱望中國和平統一之盟友拖得頭昏腦脹，以逐其因乘便資国自肥經濟政權之目的。所幸所幸现在我政府民眾以盟國友好對於當前事實均有新認識，深感恢復全國交通，整編統編軍隊，方能挽救當前中國經濟上嚴軍之危機，設再因循自誤，不惟國際地位日益墮落，倘因廣擴之局愈拖愈糟，長令交通阻隔，農業坐廢，工廠關門，鐵產萎縮，一旦天災人禍交相煎逼，我四億伍任萬同胞將無死所矣。國人如認清此一危機之必須迅速挽救，當知政府目前所採之能度慶為必要。盡政府目前所望諸於共當者，如恢復交通，整編統編軍隊均為第一次政府協商會識決而待行之識案，如上述決議不能實行，則再開一百次協商會議，又用何用。某要員語至此，繼謂：我政府每至一聚要關頭，其決定有關救國民之大計，向不拖泥帶水，渠深信主席返京後，一切商談均須根據此一原則研究實行，方不致浪費時日。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京二日電〕某可靠方面今日證實，馬歇雨將軍已擬就新的和平方案可解決東北內爭，但內容詳情保守秘密。</p>

<p>〔路透社南京二日電〕民主同盟發言人羅隆基構：今日擬就打開國共僵局之各項措施，惟內容尚未便發表，國共所爭持之範圍，無一般所傳之甚，雙方已同意必須面突，民主同盟興馬歇雨。現已以最大努力，謀打開此僵局，雙方態度並不絕無安　之意。新任交通部長俞大維接見他者時，對興馬歇雨之會談內容　亦持緘默態度，僅謂：一般意見已互相交換，俞氏並表示共當應覆行恢復交通之協定義務。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京二日電〕此關雙方可靠人士今日工業化實馬歇雨停止已有和平新計劃，〔以溶和國共雙方要求〕，惟相信恆久和平之機會仍破微弱。</p>

<h3>已簽協定政府決照辦整軍比便不改變主席指示軍事調處工作</h3>
<p>〔本報北平一日電〕（遲到）蔣主席低平後，會召見軍調部政府方面負責人，對全國調處工作，有重要指示，此種指示，殆亦政府對當前時局之態度。其要點為（一）政府誠意力求全國之和平統一，（二）凡與中共簽訂之一切協定協議，政府方面應絕對照辦，（三）復中共方面，亦實現其業經簽訂協定與協議。關於東北問題，政府認為：（一）根據中共條約與協議協定，國府應有特權接收東北主權，（二）東北共軍應遵照整軍協定，集中候命整編，東北整軍比例，不應改變。記者詢問政府是否有　與安頓以北為共軍防區之意，發言人答，倘未問此事，惟共軍若聽整編，政府應為指定地點集中。又記者今日探悉執行部尚未加強東北調處機齊之準備，近中共方面會提議派遣小組赴長春，美方贊同，但政府尚未同意。政府方面裝表示，前共軍政長春時，方面提議派遣小組赴長春，遭中共拒絕，今日似已無必要也。另一政府發言人語記者，東北並非頻結果，乃一碟子殖果，可切片分食，而碟子則有一缺口即不成其為碟子，以喻東　北主權之不可分。</p>

<h3>以政府軍還於國　白部長談國防部組織及任務</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京二日電〕國防部一日正式成立，首任部長白祟禧上將已就職，白氏對記者談該部組織及任務稱：本業革命之軍事時間，已至最後階段，故稱極準備實施實政，將舉行政院分立之軍事委員會撤銷，成立國防部，隸屬於行政院，實現以政治軍及逮軍於國之革命目的，且因係以政府治軍，如德日功好戰之軍人，將永無抬頭之可能，此誠為國家百年根本不拔之制度。國防部組織精神上有兩大特點：（一）在使軍政密切聯系，政略戰略調協。（二）在使陸海空軍軍政軍令一元化。向氏並舉國防部當前之軍要任務，要根據憲法，由元首統率陸海空軍，故凡關於軍令事宜，均由元首命令，交由參謀總長計劃及指導，國防軍之執行關於軍政事宜，在決策範圍內者，由國防部秉承行政院之命令，交由參謀總長計劃及指導，國防軍之執行國防部當前之重要任務者，計有四點：（一）確立國防計劃，國防部為行政院長之國防幕僚機關，凡國防上之種種措施，均由國防部軍義或先交國防部計劃，再令各部，備能按期完成。（二）發展國防工業，無工業即無國防，國防部對國防工業發展之程度與速度，當按國防需要。提出整個計劃，期能逐步完成。（三）建立最現代之國防軍，國防工作事項雖多，而軍隊究為其中心，國防部當確立裝備與提高將士學術，技能水準計劃，備早監督實施完成。（四）發展科學研究與一般科學已不可分，國防部擬直接對國防科學作一部分之努力。</p>

<p>七七事變的主使者，世界　　的導火者，這個尤亞不赦的劊子手——偵字第五號載記酒井隆，在南京受審了！</p>
<p>陸軍總部的軍事法庭，今天審理首次案件，而作為開端的，正是這十五年來擾亂我從長白山頭到揚子江頭的罪魁。這個消息傳播出來後，許多人都　望一見這劊子手被人制裁時的情形，尤其是新聞記者們，都早就接洽了旁聽入塲券。</p>
<p>晨八時，人們就陸續來到，這個門禁森嚴閒人莫入的軍部，今天也吞吐着一些各種形式便服的人羣，開庭時間預定是九時，延至九時四十分，庭長石美瑜，陪審官孟傳大，高其邁，包啓　，檢察官陳光　以及書記官翻譯一行到庭；不久，酒井也就在兩個　兵，兩個庭　的押解下到了庭，這個老兒六十歲了，雖然瘦，却還强作精神，進來時，那一付故作鎭靜的神氣，似乎有不可磨滅的殺氣，從他的在近視眼鏡後面放射的目光視傳達到了，一身藏靑嗶嘰西服，黃卡嘰的襯衫，但領子未扣，領帶未結，短髪，短　，無邊眼鏡，瘦削得可怕的臉龐，身材自然不高，但不算太矮。在被告席站定後，首先把　帶來的兩冊書放下，於是攝影記者們開如了鏡頭的爭取，　光燈四射，像帶着神秘性的，在輕微的機動聲裏，為這個不可赦的戰犯，留下了無數的寫眞。</p>
<p>開庭時，他始終站立着，在聽檢察官宣讀起訴書的時候，他隨時左右顧，想從人羣覓取他的同情者，同時，因為起訴　全文很長，宣讀時間達廿五分鐘，首先是讀中文，隨後再讀日文，他邊讀邊想，一面又把紙筆取出紀錄，更有時以一種極藐視而狡獪的態度笑着，似乎這些都不足為怪似的，這樣，繼續了將近一小時的時間。</p>
<p>開始審訊了，照例先是　　，年齡，他是廣　人。住在東京，一個花甲廣　人，住在東京，一個花甲老人了，一個應該以慈悲為懷的老者了，但　他曾經是一個劊子手，　　到現在還沒有認錯，沒有覺悟。</p>
<p>對於訊問他歷任　華作戰的職務，他有些　以「是的」，有時則稱：「我已經記不淸楚了，也許是的」，或許說：「大槪是的」，全部以狡獪的態度出之，在這種氣　下進行了一上午的訊問，誰的心裏，都存着不愉快，一股火似的忿怒，幾乎要衝　着了他，但是他還是那樣　慢。</p>
<p>有一段問答是這樣的：</p>
<p>「你承認東三省是中國的地方否」？</p>
<p>「是中國的領土」。</p>
<p>「旣是中國的領土，為什麽要强迫我們的軍事長官承認偽滿為「滿洲國」呢」？</p>
<p>「希望提出證據來」。</p>
<p>當經庭長宣稱：證件甚多，並以時間告，他還以一種不可　的態度對的。</p>
<p>對於屢次參加對我國　載，他則稱：「我是軍人，只知道服從，責任應由國家政府負的」，並一再說「七七事變並不是戰爭，日本人也是不願意戰爭的，日本人為了要求生存」。又說：「這是一切悮會累　起來的」，完全抹煞　實。曾經檢察官這樣反問：「你們要求生存，就要別人不能生存嗎」？實在說，這是一種　　的　　，他是　　人　　　　　，　他　　　　，　　他取其所　，　他一個　　獨　着，生存下去。</p>
<p>問他屠殺了多少中國人民，他　　不知道，並且還說：「我曾　　部下，不許隨便殺戮」。</p>
<p>關於他的　行，庭上是這樣分　的：</p>
<p>第一部份以「七七」以前，華北所有侵略行為，都是以被告為主要指　人，第二部份是「七七」發生，也是被告的主要策動人，第三部份，在戰爭中，軍隊所有各種罪行，如强姦婦女，大　殺　中英人民奴化人民等。</p>
<p>其第一部份的侵略行為有經濟·政治·軍事侵略行動等等，都查有各種證件，足　證明，第二部份則山彼告造成軍事上的事實，迫使戰爭爆發，第三部份，則廣州香港的大屠殺，不堪一　，如以被殺以五十萬人計，今殺人戰犯能提出名字的僅四五人而已，不是說十萬人只換取一個人的　命。</p>
<p>但是他一再狡辯，當下午繼續審訊，並開始辯論時，被告　完全錯誤的否認一切。</p>
<p>但是檢察官這樣說：我們的理　是：（一）代表中國千百萬被殘殺同胞，要求審判長判被告以死刑，（二）為民族生存的威脅，及中華民族之受害，要求審判長判被告以死刑，（三）為保證世界之永久和平，請判處被告以死刑。當這一段理由譯為日文，送進他的耳鼓時，他立刻黯然，眼睛失神的晃動着，不復再有上午那種不　於一談的氣燄了。在他多似的腦中，還是永遠放着一幅很好的侵略圖案的！</p>
<p>但是他繼續向庭長作非法的要求：（一）請准用日本人任翻譯，（二）希望提出確切的證據，延長宣判時日，立刻為庭長加以駁斥，不准所請。</p>
<p>接着是法庭指定的被告辯護律師王龍，起立代為申辯，大約就事實和法律兩方面加以辯論，但都不能成立。</p>
<p>最後被告又欲挽旣倒之狂瀾，說是一切還是為了威脅，於是檢察官這樣說：「中國軍事力量保衛自己都不够，還能威脅日本人的生存嗎？中國幾乎等於日本人的市塲　　　　　給日本人以經濟的威脅嗎？「七七」明明是日本一手造成，還能說不知道嗎？」</p>
<p>這個陰險，狡詐，作惡多端的人，就在他從神經中獲的　誤起，不屈服，然而又不能不同公理底頭的情况下，　了　　　　。</p>
<p>庭長的宣布是卅」　宣判，但事後經審判官等會商，　　　　再辯論的必要，臨時改期，但聽說在六月十五日前，是必須把這案件淸理了的！</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>國防部的任務</h3>
<p>國防部於六月一日成立，部長白崇禧和參謀總長陳誠兩氏業已到部視事，同時前參謀總長兼中國陸軍總司令何應欽將軍通電全國軍官，一致擁護這新制度。這在中國近代軍事史上，揭開了新的一頁。這一個革新，不僅可視為　埔建軍以來的一大軍事改革，而且也是中國政治制度與軍事機構上一個重要的進步。今日我國朝野所一致期望的，就是軍隊國家化，和政治民主化，換句話說，即實行軍隊整　以求軍政軍令的統一，實行軍黨分立與軍民分治，為實施民主政治奠基礎。政府此次　撤軍理委員會與軍政部，而代以國防部，不僅由戰時的軍事機構　為平時的機構，而且使軍事機構與行政機構發生隸屬關係，對於軍隊國家化與政治民主化，自具有極大的推動力。誠如陳總長所說：「此次國防部之放立，乃為中國軍事機構上劃時代的改組，係採取民主國之軍事制度，而使軍事附屬於政治」。所以國防部的成立，不論在軍事上或政治上均有極大的意義</p>
<p>以我國軍政制度而言，北洋軍閥時代軍人的跋扈姑不　論，即從國民革命軍北伐時代起，以迄於今，二十年來，中央軍事機構向直屬於國民政府，此或由於革命時期與對外抗戰的軍事需要所致。以前在行政院之下，雖也有軍政部的設立，但是純屬軍事行政的機構，且因軍政軍令糾　不淸，其職權更加狹小，軍政部同時又須受軍委會的指揮，故在國防部成立之前，我國軍政幾乎是與行政沒有多大關係的。這種制度究竟是一種戰時體制，現在抗戰結束，自有改　易轍的必要。大槪一般人的意見，對於當前中國軍事問題，亟待興革的，有下列四項：（一）軍隊屬於國家，確保軍政軍令之統一。（二）軍隊建制，實行軍黨分立，軍民分治，改進軍事敎育，充實裝備，健全人事經理制度，以建設現代化之國軍。（三）改善徵兵制。（四）全國軍隊（包括國軍和共軍）應按照　軍計劃，切實　編。但是解決這些問題的先決條件，首在建立一個健全合理的軍事機構。此次國防部之加速成立，其重要意義即在此。</p>
<p>至於國防部今後應負的任務，不必說，人人都知道必極重大。　今日中國的情勢，將來加果不能建立現代化的軍隊，即無法保持民族國家的生存，更不能負起維持遠東乃至全世界的和平安全的責往。我們以為國防部至少要努力辦到下列　事：</p>
<p>第一，要切實　到軍隊國家化，此實為　立現代化國軍的先決條件。我們環觀世界列强，在政治上雖有　派的分野，但在軍事上則絕無淚別，其統帥權完全屬於國家，根本沒有「　軍」的存在。並且在政治上人事更迭或許較多，而在軍事上的人事與組織，鮮有調動。列强軍政的關係，不特軍事須服從政治，抑　軍事超然在政治　渦之上，很少受政局變動的影響。理由很簡單，因為軍事原是保障民族國家獨立生存的唯一工具，在國際關係錯綜複雜的今日，危機四伏，隨時有引起戰禍的可能，任何一國如果沒有自衛力量，就不足以生存在這個世界上。所謂「生存競爭，優勝劣敗」，在今日原子時代　更加明顯。我國軍隊國家化，今後如還不能實現，現代化的國軍就無法建立。所以軍隊能否國家化，實是我國生死存亡的關健。在國防部成立後，首光應辦的事，也就是如何能使全國軍隊　可國家化。目前國內政治陷於僵局的　結，東北戰亂的再起，誰也不能否認由於軍隊之尙未能國家化所致。若要問軍隊國家化的具體辦法，那我們就可答復，早經政治協商會議協定在案，只要誠心誠意實施和平建國綱領，只要政府與中共同時切實　行，就不難貫澈國防部的使命。</p>
<p>第二，要集中全力，建立國防。過去我國門戶洞開，幾無國防可言；日寇一經發動侵略戰、即艮驅直入我國腹地，幾乎無法遏阻。連一個嚴酷的歷史敎訓，我們何能忽視！就我國目前國際環境來看，更應「亡羊補牢」，切不可稍存僥倖心理。再　　列强，專心一致於國防的建設，我國更有急起直追的必要。例如蘇聯，戰後它的國際地位，早可高枕無憂，但在蘇聯當局，仍斤斤於「安全區」的擴充，以防戰禍再起時可作　衝地帶。此在美國，保守原子炸彈的秘密，絕對不肯公開，並在世界各地廣設海空基地，猶嫌不足，還要把國內的海陸空三軍，保持戰時的標準。一切的一切，都是為本國的安全，都是為了本國的國防。固然我們聽到貝爾納斯的呼籲縮軍，和恩斯坦的主張建立世界政府，但須知一個毫無國防基礎的國家，是沒有資格去談這些高調的。所以國防部必須集中全力，建設國防，而中國國民也必須　蘇聯建國的榜樣，束緊褲帶，擁護政府建立國防。</p>
<p>第三，要建立新軍，尤須實行整軍，而實行整軍則須採取精兵主義。重質不重量。我國陸軍，在數量上講，為世界任何一國所不及，但在質的方面，却瞠子其後！在抗戰期間，為展開全面防衛起見，不得不擁有如此龐大的單隊，但時至今日，擁有龐大軍隊，與國防無益，而給養活大，國家財政不勝負担，反足以　殺經濟，妨害了國家的建設與進步。所以我們主張精兵主義，然而我們對編餘的官兵，必須不忘記他們在抗戰期間，曾為國家作殊死戰，立下保國衛民的功勛，必須妥善安排他們，使他們在生活上敎育上精神上，完全各得其所。</p>
<p>總之，國防部的成立，　制度上的一大興革，但是最重要的，還是「事在人為」。我們在國防部成立之際，對何前總長的　達風度，為立功的將領樹立模範，固非常欽佩，而　願新任的白部長與陳德長，埋頭苦幹，為中國的建軍作更進一步的努力。强盛的中國是世界和平的　　，而國防部實　有使中國强盛的一部分重大責任。</p>

<h3>西國問題調查委會提議　聯合國應對西絕交　弗朗哥爲和平之潛在威脅</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦二日廣播：今日馬德里各晨報以顯著地位刋載安全理事會調查弗朗哥西班牙小組委員會之建議，主張聯合國與西班牙斷絕外交關係，如非弗朗哥政權下台。弗朗哥政權宣傳工作領袖一反已往慣例，認爲此等攻擊對於維持弗朗哥政權有利，而予以揭載。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約一日電〕聯合國機構西班牙問題調查委員會今日對弗朗哥政府表示道義上的譴責，并建議安全理事會以西班牙問題轉交聯合國最高機構即全體大會處理。委員會宣佈弗朗哥政權「國際和平可能的威脅」，並提議全世界普遍對西班牙絕交，除非弗朗哥政府于本年九月間撤換。報告書中建議安全理事會將此事提出本年九月三日在紐約舉行之五十一國大會。請大會要求全體會員國與西班牙絕交，除非弗朗哥政權「引退」。弗朗哥政權目前雖不威脅和平，但其各項行動，足以引起威脅，此外報告書中建議安全理事會贊同三月間英法美三國反弗朗哥聯合宣言，即呼召西班牙人已以和平方式推翻弗朗哥，樹立代理政府，以至自由選舉實行時爲止。委員會五委員，除波蘭與巴西採取保留態度外，其余一致贊同此項報告書。波蘭爲該案之原提議者，對報告採取保留態度，巴西代表亦採取保留態度。建議該案交達聯合國大會，請大會呼召各會員國對弗朗哥絕交。調查報告書提議弗朗哥政權推翻之后，及其他各項自由條件，即釋放政治犯，召囘放逐之西班牙人，政治集會自由及自由公開選舉，進行滿意之后，則聯合國應邀請西班牙加入爲會員國。</p>
<p>調查委員會發現各項事實如下：（一）弗朗哥政權爲「法西斯政權」；（二）戰爭期間，弗朗哥曾給予各敵國實質援助；（三）弗朗哥與希特勒墨索里尼勾結，對聯合國發動戰爭；（四）自戰爭結束以來，弗朗哥在若干事件中，對消除歐洲法西斯主義與納粹主義殘跡，拒絕合作；（五）弗朗哥政權繼續殘害政敵；（六）武裝人員數額遠較任何愛好和平及非侵略國家所期望者爲大。</p>
<p>報告書中對於波蘭及西班牙流亡政府指摘弗朗哥政府在德國科學家援助之下從事原子學研究一節，則並未提及。</p>
<p>報告書已分發安全理事會十一會員國，將於下次會議提出討論，下次會期大約爲本月五日。</p>
<h3>君主歟？共和歟？　義人民踴躍投票　結果在本星期內不致揭曉　米蘭兩黨發生衝突</h3>
<p>「聯合社羅馬二日電」義大利人民今晨紛往各投票處，踴躍投票，在君主與共和間有所抉擇，並選舉制憲議會。據內政部宣佈：投票結果在本月七日以前不致揭曉。此次投票，婦女參加之眾，為以前所未有，有人目擊天主教民主黨領袖加斯貝里總理在首都投票，但國王安伯托二世是否投票，則不得而知。羅馬市上有警察乘電戰車與卡車巡邏，但無意外事故，惟聞米蘭方面，今日午前二時有炸彈一枚在共產黨與社會黨報紙辦公室內爆發，傷工人三名，並引起火災。</p>
<p>〔聯合社羅馬一日電〕義大利舉行公民投票，表決帝制存廢之前夕，米蘭君主共和兩黨，已於今日發生衝突。義王安伯托二世在米蘭大禮堂門口出現時，外面示威者已衝破警察保衛線，致不得不改由間道歸去。義大利此次選舉，選民除決定君主共和之外，並將選舉制憲議會代表，以起草新義大利之政治，社會及經濟原則。此爲墨索里尼實行獨裁以來之第一　次自由選舉，選民女多於男，男子有投票權者約一千三百萬人，女子約一千五百萬人。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社羅馬一日電〕義公民投票結果，共和黨若果估有多多數，則義王室即將離開本國，依照加斯貝利總理與盟國統制制委員會執行委員勒許准將舉行會議所採決定，　時王室將經由熱內亞港出國。</p>
<h3>人口出生率太快　地球要容不下了　世界現有人口廿萬萬</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓一日電〕美國人口調查統計所今日宣布，全世界現有人口二十萬萬，如照現在之生死率推算，則在三百年內將增加至二百萬萬，須再有四十五個地球始能予以容納。世界各國人口出生率最高者爲中國及印度。印度自一九三0年至一九四0年間，出生人口雖在兩歲左右夭折四分之一，但十年間仍增加五千萬人，該國人口死亡率如降低至美國水準，則在一百年之內，印度人至少可以蕃殖至五個現在大小之地球，中國亦然。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦二日電〕星期四觀察報稱：英駐東南亞特別專員裝能動侰，正以非正式之方式，覓取暹羅越南疆界糾紛之妥協辦法，爭摯之地乃暹羅於一九四一年取自法國之老撾及柬埔寨之一部份土地。暹人對此等土地，具有深刻之感情，故不妨稱之爲暹羅之阿爾薩斯勞蘭。</p>

<h3>今日六三禁烟節　照例燒鴉片　警局嚴限本月底　禁絕全市烟毒　銷售販運一律處以極刑</h3>
<p>本日為六三禁烟節，上午，九時市政府紀念週與六三禁烟節紀念會同時舉行，吳市長國禎將親自出席報告有關禁烟事宜，並申述禁绝本市烟毒之次心。上午十一時警察局在外灘公開焚燒烟具及毒品，以促起社會之注意。警局並定本年六月底，禁絕本市烟毒，本市烟民在六月底仍未戒除者，一經查出，決從嚴法辦，對於「銷售」、「販運」、「製造」者一律處以極刑。</p>
<p>解除烟毒，中央早具決心，迭經頒佈法規，明令飭辦有案。本市已過去租界環境情形特殊，禁行禁政，未能澈底，而敵偽盤踞八載，又復施行毒化，以致滬上幾成烟毒淵蔽，言之深可痛心。上海市警察局於上年九月接收後，即注重於此項工作，宣局長以禁政攸關民族興衰，注意力特別加強，經依據中央法令，訂定本市各項計劃法規，呈奉市府核准公佈施行。一面即照規定，以三十五年三月底以前為烟民自新登記期間，六月底以前一律戒絕，在登記期內，經多方宣傳鼓勵自新，並搜集敵偽時期內烟民登記冊，蜜飭各分局切實辦理。</p>
<p>拘辦烟犯　五百餘名</p>
<p>截至三月底止，共計登記烟民六〇六〇人，繳存烟土二四九兩七錢，又一包，四塊，白粉五斤十二兩四錢半，又二百四十四包，烟膏四塊，又兩盒半，又一兩四錢，烟泡七四五只，烟灰八罐半，又五包，又半盒，又十兩九錢六分，烟渣七包，烟槍三九七支，烟燈四〇六只，零星烟具，如烟盒銅杓扦子烟盒等，共計一二〇八件，除烟土呈准撥充製藥之用及成數白粉另案辦理外，其餘悉數定今日六三禁烟節在外灘公園焚燬，以期促醒社會注意。自四月一日以後查運烟毒人犯，或送調駖，或送法院審辦，截至現在止，統計調駖嫌疑犯一九一人，送法辦烟犯三五一人，（此數）係至四月底止。五月份因各分局未經報齊尚難統計）戶長連坐切結，由民政處通令各區公所辦理，原限四月十五日前葉送各分局轉呈存核，旋以選舉事忙，致迄未呈送齊全。至於烟毒調駖所已照規定就警察醫院內附設，成立戒烟醫院，亦奉市府指定上海市立戒烟醫院辦理，惟因病房床位有限，容納數並無多，不無困難。</p>
<p>戒烟藥丸　本月發售</p>
<p>衛生局自奉頒肅清烟毒辦法後，即組織肅清烟毒協助委員會，推進工作，一面令飭各公私醫療機構，一體參加協助施戒。又市警局調騐所化驗工作，最近由該局辦理，並由市立戒烟醫院專事收容勒戒烟犯，現更奉令會同民政處警察局協議，擬訂肅清烟毒實施計劃及進度表，以便按期實施，並將市戒烟醫院擴充為市立戒烟示範所，設置三百床位，以收容勒戒烟民。關于戒絕鴉片所需之藥劑，茲已製就依照市府核定之上海市志願自戒烟民購用戒烟丸辦法，交由局藥品供應處各供應所，自本月起發售。茲將辦法錄之於後：</p>
<h3>志願自戒烟民購用戒丸辦法</h3>
<p>（一）本辦法根據行政院　　地區肅清烟毒辦法第九條及第十條之規定訂定之。（二）戒烟丸由本市衛生局遵照衛生署所定處方配置供應。（三）凡本市志願自戒烟民，經由警察局登記後，憑登記證向本市衛生局藥品供應處購買登記證，由衛生局藥品供應處加蓋戳記。（四）戒烟丸共分八號，自戒之烟民，應自度其烟癮之深淺，按號購服。（五）購買戒烟丸之烟民，依照服用方法，服完後，仍未戒絕者，得憑登記證上次購買之發藥，再購買一次。（六）凡貧苦烟民經保甲長及警察局證明後，得持證向衛生局藥品供應處請購戒烟丸，並得酌予減免收費，經售機關須詳晰登記。（七）戒烟丸不得仿製及轉售，如違得依法懲處。（八）本辦法自公布之日起施行。</p>

<h3>本市物價高於海外　外輪多空船返國　六倉庫一再增棧租</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自勝利後，歐美航商紛紛複業，大批船舶銜尾而來，因本市碼頭浮筒設備缺乏，卸貨不易，往往停泊數星期之久，開支耗大，損失甚鉅，尤以本市物價較各國高昂，輸出因之減少，大部份外輪均空船返國，我國海關對輸入之奢侈品，禁止甚嚴，故各外輪貨運亦受影響。上星期六天祥洋行，曾致電菲律賓，將來滬之二輪，如有奢侈品，勿運來滬，令在菲島或香港卸起，以免抵滬不能進口，又關於本市堆棧一再增價，客商殊有不勝負擔之苦。據太古、中華、藍烟囱、隆茂、公和祥、上海碼頭公司等六家倉庫，聯合通告：六月一日起，增加棧租百分之一百，加後再加百分之五十，此種巧妙之方法，實際計算，竟加百分之二百，例如棉花棧租每尺每月二百六十元，（每件約計十二尺，）水泥每包每月二百六十元，每桶六百三十一元，如此高昂之棧租，客商無力擔負，輪船之運輸，亦間接受相當影響。</p>
<p>外銷不利癥結所在</p>
<p>關於外貨廉價傾銷，出口實易無法展開之際，記者曾訪出口界權威有所叩詢，據稱：外銷不利因素，原因甚多，並不在匯率放長一端，即可解決，但匯率之伸縮，攸關整個國家財政與國民經濟，更不無國際牽制，未可輕率決定。現中央銀行規定，「息借外幣辦法」，實為妥善政策，將來對於出口專業，可得獎勵，從此更可樹立繁榮基礎。簡言之，實施此項辦法，將減低利息，厥為成本之要素，其他如交通工具之增加，管理方面之加強諸點，亦為出口商人之共同要求，運輸太慢，不能爭取時間，自與成本攸關。再者，現代國家均鼓勵出口專業，以爭取外匯，各國對於出口稅收，概行豁免，我國所嚴定出口稅為數雖微，若能與其他各國採取同一步驟，則可的更多裨益。</p>
<h3>禁烟與衛生</h3>
<p>— 俞松筠</p>
<p>（一）禁烟與民族健康　今天是上海市光復後的第一個禁烟節，意義特別重大。過去八年，淪陷期中，敵人施行毒化政策的殘酷，說起來真是可怕，只要看現在吸烟吸毒的人這麼多，毒化程度這樣深，就可想見。試問敵人爲什麽要對我們施行毒化政策呢？理由很簡單：他們要破壞我們的社會經濟，更重要的是要摧殘我們民族的健康，縮短我們的生命。當年林則徐先生曾說：烟毒不除，則數十年後，非特無可籌之餉，抑且無可練之兵。這是有遠見的話。敵人是用這樣的毒計，來滅亡我們的。</p>
<p>現在戰爭勝利了，我們要求民族的永久生存，自然要求民族體格的健康；要求民族體格的健康，非從速禁絕烟毒不可。所以禁烟是民族健康運動的中心工作。民族健康運動的方式，固然很多，但總沒有比禁烟工作更佔主要的地位。因為禁烟工作的目地，是掃除威脅人民健康的　　，希望每一個烟民「脫離苦海」，重新踏上康樂的人生之路。這種工作可以說是積極的工作，是極合於保健原則的工作。</p>
<p>（二）上海的禁烟工作　禁烟工作分禁種、禁運、禁製、禁售、禁吸等幾種。本市主管機關為警察局，衛生局已衛生立場，協辦調騐與戒烟二事。關於檢騐方面，警察局設有烟毒調騐所於警察醫院，專負吸烟嫌疑人調騐之責。因該所檢騐設備缺乏，固由市府規定，凡烟民小便化騐，一概送由衛生局辦理。關於戒烟方面，本市現有市立戒烟醫院一所，設於閘北橫浜路。自三十四年十二月一日成立起，至三十五年四月三十日止，共計投院施戒者二百六十四人，已戒絕二百十一人。此二百六十四人中，計男性一百八十四人，女性八十人。吸毒種　　，以吸鴉片者為多，共計一百九十五人，海洛英次之，共計六十人，嗎啡注射者四人，海洛英注射者五人。年齡方面，以三十六歲至四十歲者為最多，四十一歲至四十五歲者次之，吸毒年數以一年至十年者為最多，十一年至二十年者次之。吸毒原因，以玩要而成癮者為最多，因胃病而吸者次之，因肺結核而吸者又次之。戒烟者職業分類，計商人一百八十七人，工人十九人，居家無事者四十七人，教育界農界各三人，新聞界政界醫界各一人。上海烟民眾多，戒烟醫院所收容者，僅為極小部分。來此皆為自動求戒的，一般境況較好。有許多窮苦的烟民，多吸白麵或打嗎啡針，衛生局歷來檢埋露屍，有許多便是打嗎啡針吸白麵的。戒烟醫院又有二件事，值得告訴大家的：第一是烟民的精神訓練。一般醫護人員，除在技術方面，盡其責任，助病人達到戒絕的目的外，並作種種精神方面的啟導，使戒烟者增加戒絕的決心，並愉快其心境，減少精神上的苦悶。第二是窮苦的吸烟者，可以申請享受免費住院的便利。</p>
<p>（三）我的幾點希望　今天我借禁烟紀念的機會，貢獻幾句話：（甲）行政院於三十四年十二月明令公佈之「收復地區肅清烟毒辦法」第二條規定：「每一省市施戒總限期，至遲不得逾六個月」。本市施戒限期已近，凡未施戒的人，希望趕快投戒，不要自誤。（乙）「禁烟禁毒治罪暫行條例」第六條規定：」「施打嗎啡或吸用毒品者處死刑，吸食鴉片者處一年以上五年以下有期徒刑，有癮者並限期交醫勒令戒絕，勒戒而復吸食者處死刑或無期徒刑」。這是告訴大家，吸食鴉片或其他毒品，將受刑事處分，以及復吸後處罰的可怕。請大家快把握時機，及早戒絕。（丙）凡用誇大方式，作虛偽宣傳的戒烟劣藥，我們是絕對禁止的，希望大家不要上當，並且隨時檢舉，協助取締。（丁）不論玩要成癮，或因病而吸的人，戒絕後要使衰弱的體格變成強壯的體格，並不困難，而且是絕對可能的，只要大家注意施行下面所說的五件事：第一，每天要有適度的運動，第二，常常洗澡，第三，飲食有定時，並注意營養之配合，第四，早睡早起，第五，每天大便一次。這幾件事能夠切實做到，則身心健康，自必大有進步。</p>
<p>總之，吸食毒品是可恥的事，也是可怕的事。其貽害之處，不僅害自身，而且也害及兒孫。凡是吸食毒品的，其自身虛弱，不必說了，他的兒孫體格上，也將發生嚴重的虛弱症。所以我希望吸食毒品的，立定脚跟，咬緊牙關，及早戒絕，為自己圖生存，同時也為兒孫爭一口氣！</p>

<h3>記小學課程標準會議</h3>
<p>— 何以聰</p>
<p>道三天——五月廿七至廿九日——中，三十幾位初等教育專家和教部的特派專員們，圍坐象徵全國建設性的凈白會議桌旁，辛苦地進行着這個舉國矚目的小學課程標準會議，我以旁聽的資格，徼倖地也參加這個盛大場面，感到無上的欣慰！</p>
<p>會場在上海市陜西南路　年支團部的草原北畔，環境是那麼優美，坐在業窗面　席旁，向裹可以望見內部懸著的大鏡子裹，正滿映著窗外面的　　，緣陰搖曳，使人馳想到　樓深處的清涼風味，這樣優美，寂靜，莊肅的環境中，也只有這個偉大的工作才配得上做。</p>
<p>關於會議，已有夏蔡兩位先生的記錄，這裏將在記錄以外，做一些自由的報道。</p>
<p>正如前面所說的，會場中空氣的靜穆，是任何會議中找不出來的，這不愧是一個專家們的會議，使人無形中意識到中國教育前途的偉大。會議開了三天半，兩個半天是分組舉行的，會場中印象人人最深的，是主席顧樹森司長，那副謙　老到宿將的神氣，一切辯論，都從他的手中得到解決。會議第二天的早晨，太早了，會場中只有我和他兩個人，他笑着要去打球，在球場上馳騁的當兒，我與暗暗地稱讚他的「老當益壯」。</p>
<p>全體對各科問題的討論，都很熱烈，如蓄任堅·薛天漢·施仁夫·劉　牧·溫　桐等，尤其董任堅這位老先生，（新陸師範校長），禿著頂的頭發，發起言來卻很堅強，末了舉行綜結討論時，竟和顧司長起了對子。最溫和的要算陳鶴琴·沈百英·和陳伯吹三位先生，平心斂氣，沒一句過火話。使人感到遺憾的，不是沒有，當大家討論進入最緊張的時候，一位老先生竟呼呼的打起鼾來，有幾位先生只會抽煙，不肯講話，也未免尸位素　之嫌，還有有趣的，最後的一天，那位董校長還率領了他的家庭音樂隊，親自來表演音樂的價值，給人會穿插一個美麗的鏡頭。休息時，我要部裏的一位黃先生寫了一幅墨竹，他署款時笑着告訴我，我叫黃若舟，一家報上把我誤寫了黃若丹，申報又變成了王若舟，真是一個大笑話。</p>
<p>在幾天會議裏，我感到教育當前的有兩大危機，第一是內地教育水準的低陋，第二是師資的恐慌，前者就是黃先生報告的，他說跑到那面不要說課程的內容，連課程的名目也是七零八落的，後者更是橫在上海的切實現象了，肚皮吃不飽，誰還高興苦守在這個崗位上。這兩個危機都很迫切，需要補救的方面當然很多，但我這裏不擬提出來，因為提出來了，人家不能做，也是枉然。</p>
<p>最後一點，我要稱美他們諸位先生對各種問題都具有虛懷若谷的精神，這次位育小學教材研究會和林爾逸（見申報）先生提出的兩個意見，他們都會詳細的提出討論過，事實不能否認。這次的會議就不過是這麼一個會議，短短幾天內的成就是極有限度的，議案的生效又是有待於多方條件的實現。可是目前教育前進的需要，是那麼迫切，人們對會議的希望又是那麼熱誠，主持這個會議的教育部，將怎樣接受全國各地教育人們的通訊建議？怎樣應合各種正確的經驗和理由？集師廣益，使我們全國的基　教育力走上新生祖國底建設之路。五月三十日</p>
<h3>萬目睽睽盛傳邇遐　肺病驗方之疑難問題</h3>
<p>五月十九日本報發表陜西鳳翔縣警察局張錫賢局長所寄治肺驗方以來，大受讀者歡迎。估計照方進服者，為數已經不少，各方面來函詢問及商討者亦有五十餘件，選送本欄顧問中醫陳存仁先生再度研究，承將各問題逐項答覆，披露如次：（編者）</p>
<p>（一）陳延齡等十二人問　此方太貴，可否出各患病讀者　合配購？</p>
<p>〔陳存仁醫師答〕此方每藥二錢，現時上海藥價每劑為四千三百餘元，　合配購事不可能。今將藥名修改：東阿膠改為阿膠珠，川貝母改象貝母。藥價即可改少至二千六百元，但功效則相同也，如欲再便宜，則可向「藥行」每藥各購半斤，自行分配為四十劑，每劑合得之數極賤，但此非熟於藥行情形者不辦。</p>
<p>（二）吳灝·項志強等八人問　此方是否有預防肺病之功效？</p>
<p>〔陳存仁醫師答〕此方並無預防能力，肺弱無癆者服此僅收營養之功。</p>
<p>（三）陳伯民醫師及王業勤·郭練綱·周森之·徐之謙·陳似松讀君問　此方藥味如白芷明天冬紅花東阿膠等有無錯誤？藥品份量有無可商之處？</p>
<p>〔陳存仁醫師答〕白芷天冬等味，實係原方如此，並未刋誤·但白芷一味，應用時確有考慮必要；紅花分量，亦有商討餘地，為合理起見，鄙人以為此方應行更改者有數點：白芷須改為蒸百部，以增殺菌之效；紅花甘草用量宜輕；生地桑白皮宜重；阿膠宜改用阿膠珠。雞蛋三枚太多而太悶，消化頗成問題，久服令人　　，雞蛋在配合上本無重大關係，但為增進營養起見，不妨另外煮食，一枚亦可，二枚已足。今將此方合理的修正如次：</p>
<p>桑白皮，天冬，生地各三錢，大熟地，阿膠珠，杏仁，象貝，白芍，知母，蒸百部各二錢，紅花，甘草各五分·（另外每日食蛋二枚）</p>
<p>如此修正，不但收效較高，藥價亦減為每劑一千七百餘元矣。</p>

<h3>真誠性的文章</h3>
<p>— 邵洵美</p>
<p>這幾年來沒有寫什麼文章，腦子簡直生了銹，一枝筆好像有幾千斤重，實在缺乏勇氣去提他一提，提了起來又沒有力量去動他一動。</p>
<p>寫文章本來不可以勉強。勉強寫出來的文章，正如沒有長足，也沒有發紅的蘋果，多少帶些生青氣，還帶些酸味。</p>
<p>可是硬遍出來的文章也不是沒有。人家看得起你，要你表示些意見，你不能真的一言不發。在這種情形之下，我常說，你有什麼話說什麼話；多就多說幾句，少就少說幾句。不過有一個條件：話得要是真話。凡是真的東西，不論是一句話，一朵花，一張　子，都有一種美，一種感人的力量。</p>
<p>有許多文藝評論家，貫經會　了研究古往今來偉大的作品的特點。研究的結果，全以為作品的偉大，不外真誠二字：只有真誠才能永久，才能普遍。</p>
<p>我們所要求的文章便是一種真誠的文章。</p>
<p>阿爾特斯·赫胥裡會經在一篇叫做文學裏的鄙俗性的論文裏說過：「這是鄙俗的，在文章裏去表現那些你並不真有的，而是因為一切高尚的人都有，於是覺得你自己也應當有的情感。」</p>
<p>所以為了要　就時尚，硬說　心的話；或是為了要掩飾自己的弱點，故意批評人，咒罵人，而暴露出來的又正是他自己所有的罪惡：這種行為確是鄙俗到了極點。</p>
<p>在最近的出版界中，這種幾乎是普遍的現象，原因當然還是投機取巧，也可以說是「暴露狂」與「低級錯綜」作崇。八年的抗戰，天天在緊張裏生活，心理變熊也是一種不容易完全避免的事實。</p>
<p>戰後的社會本來要經過相當時期的紊亂。第一次大戰的歐美各國留存着有許多例子，所以我們要看到有什麼不入眼的事情或文章，也　可以不必奇怪。可是一般的人心已變成虛偽欺詐，為了要挽救人心，自應竭力來提倡真誠性的文章。</p>
<p>歐洲有一位大革命家說過：「國家經過一次大變亂，正像一個污穢的池子經過一次搗動，所有池底裏的骯髒的東西都浮到水面上來了。」對付的方法，只有靜着心等待，總有一天會乾淨的·可是我們得隨時提防，隨時告訴人，千萬勿把浮在水面上的骯髒東西，誤以為是出衆的人材。</p>
<h3>繪畫的看法</h3>
<p>— 溫桐</p>
<p>在我們的日常生活中，很容易接觸繪畫，尤其是在上海，繪畫的展覽會，差不多常常可以看見，那麼，對於繪畫這一種藝術，究竟應該怎樣去看呢？</p>
<p>繪畫是平面藝術，換句話說，當我們看的時候，只要注意繪畫的一個畫面而已。圍繞我們的周邊，繪畫可以說有好多種類，比如中國畫，油畫，漫畫，廣告畫……都是繪畫，究竟這些繪畫看起來是否一樣，或是某一種繪畫應該如何看法？這種種問題，我們是應該首先解決的。</p>
<p>繪畫的種類雖然多，可是我們不妨把它分成二類，即：一種是純粹的繪畫，這是專門給大家看的；另一種是實用的繪畫，是做宣傳或廣告用的。雖然前一種也有可能當宣傳的作用，但藝術的成份畢竟是主要條件；後一種並不是完全沒有藝術因素，可是主要的目標是說明，紀錄，和指示。</p>
<p>我在這裏，只想說明前一種所謂純粹繪畫的看法，——即中國畫，西洋畫，大衆繪畫（木刻，漫畫）的看法。</p>
<p>首先，我們來說明中國畫的看法：中國車，普通可以分為人物畫，山水畫，花鳥畫三天類，製作這種繪畫的器材，主要的是毛筆，宣紙或絹，墨顏料，而中國畫中，　　是佔畫最重要的地位。</p>
<p>當我們看見一幅中國畫的時候，首先　把握的是布局，　要看賓主的位置。荊浩說：「筆法布置，更在臨時」。李成說：「先立賓主之位，決定遠近之形，然後穿　景物，擺布高低」。</p>
<p>其次是要注意的是筆　，中國畫是注重用筆用墨的，筆是線條約構成，墨是色彩的傳施。他的粗細輕重，抑陽頓挫，都應該合乎要求，王麓豪說：「用筆用墨，相為表裏·」顧凝遠說：「元人用筆生，用意拙，有深意焉」。又說：「生則無荞氣，故文人所謂文人之筆也：拙則無作氣，故雅人所謂雅人深致也。」王石谷說：「用筆有粗有細，有濃有淡，若出一律則光矣。」至于用墨。張庚則說：「墨不論濃淡乾濕，要不帶半點烟火食氣，斯為極致。」沈宗騫說：「墨著縑素，龍統一片，是為死墨：濃淡分明，便是活墨，死墨無彩，活墨有光，不可不函為辨也。」這些話，正可作為理解中國畫筆墨的幫助。</p>
<p>國畫中的形似問題，並不佔董重要的地位所以張彥遠說：「古之畫，或遣其形似而尚其骨氣，以形似之外求其畫，以難與俗人道也。」</p>
<p>國畫的最高準則是「氣　生動」，但這是一個抽象的理念，看的人於其在抽象的理念中去摸索，還不如從它的幾個基本特徵上體味來得便利。所謂特徵，第一是輕淡，饒自然說：「布置須上下空闊，四帝疏通，庶幾滿濃，若充塞滿腹，便不風致。」第二是恬靜，便是忘我的境界。王石谷說：「畫至神妙處，必有靜氣」。又說：「畫至於靜，其登峰造極矣乎。」第三是開逸，即「無意」或「即興」要在不限定的時間中求之，張庚說：「氣韻有發於墨者，有發於筆者，有發於意者，有發於無意者，發於無意者為上。」第四是古雅，沈宗騫說：「欲於古人法度外，另開一境，鮮有不入魔道者。」如果對於這四種特徵都能領悟的話，看中國畫也就不難了。</p>
<p>中國畫上的題跋，印章，與整個畫面有　連的關係，看中國畫的人，也得注意。至于古畫的真假，好壞，是鑑別的問題，對于看　看中國畫的人，不是最重要的事。</p>
<p>其次我們要說明洋畫的看法了。所謂洋畫，是指油畫，水彩畫，木炭畫等來講它大體也可分為人物，風景，靜物三種，若與中國畫來比較，好像是方法，材料，內容的不同，實在還是精神的不同，中國畫是出世的，西洋畫是現實的。中國畫以　愷之，謝赫的理論為根據，「氣韻生動」即是它的生命，也就是作家內在的精神和感情的表現。</p>
<p>從這一種理論出發，中國車的描寫態度，一般地便說是寫意的，反之，西洋畫則是寫實的，然而廣泛地解釋起來，國畫也不是非寫實，不過是由心理的表現發展到客觀的描寫，是一種主觀的寫實罷了。</p>
<p>西洋畫的寫實，是客觀的，科學的，實證的，在畫面上，最重要的條件，便是空間觀念，換句話說：要在平面之上，現出恰恰像照相底片上所映出來的物象，有遠近，高低，大小，把在許多不同平面上的東西，在同一平面上描寫出來。</p>
<p>如果再以國畫的畫面來比較，那完全是不同的，國車上往往可以允許留下很多的空白，只要它能和所描的形象得到有機的聯絡，所以國畫上，往往只描一株花或一塊石頭，就作可為一幅繪畫，而在洋畫上，是絕對不可能的事，因為西洋畫所要求的，是現實的形象的再現，也就是要從理智出發企圖構成一個準確的空間觀念的視覺藝術。</p>
<p>洋畫的看法固然應該注意光線，空間，形體，色彩，筆技，構圖與構思，好的西洋畫，但不一定要描寫細膩，故事逼真，像二十世紀的新興洋畫，確根本衝破了傳統的技法，也可說與看中國畫的方法是相像的。</p>
<p>最後，我們應該提出大衆繪畫的看法。</p>
<p>所謂大衆繪畫，是指描寫大衆，接近大衆，指示大衆的漫畫，木刻而言，漫畫與木刻的內容往往充滿豐富的宣傳性，因此看起來往往會只注意內容而忽略形式，這是要不得的。</p>
<p>一幅優秀漫畫或木刻的條件，內容是現實的，而表現這現實的內容的手段，是繪畫的基礎技術——寫實，如果沒有寫實的基礎而徒弄一些小聽敏，這種作品是站不住的。</p>
<p>把握了這樣的基本看法，雖然如何變形，夸張的漫畫，低劣的技法，究竟還不能掩飾過哩。關於木刻，刀法上可有細密的與粗大的分別，作品的優劣，並不在粗細上分別，確在於繪畫的基礎技法的能否充實的一點之上。至於現階段的漫畫木刻的內容，當然是應該以能否表現民主精神為前提來決定優劣的。</p>
<h3>風塵</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>轉一身疲倦，從一個城市跋涉到了另一個縣城，整天的辛勞，一路的勞頓，所換得的是些什麼呢？除了滿臉的塵灰之外。</p>
<p>什麼也沒有，連鮮明的記憶，鮮艷的色彩也都從時間的巨流裏冲淡了。面前的一切都是灰灰的，灰色的行人，灰色的原野，灰色的宇宙啊！</p>
<p>原野的風沙是多麼的大？記得第一天離家，對面前的風沙是　出了驚愕。會想儘了方法來阻擋，來搏鬥，然而也終於染上了風塵的顏色了。</p>
<p>在那淡淡的灰黃的顏色裏，一大段的時光卻也過去了。</p>
<p>人為什麼得在灰黃的旅途上永無休止地走呢？</p>
<p>在旅途上，行旅是多麼的希罕着原始的色彩，那鮮艷的紅，有如煊染在天際的落日，那燦爛的綠，有如野生在原野的植物。看陽光從東方沉落到西方，想着一　　的人在原野裏馳騁，一棵棵新生的植物在風沙裏茁長起來，心裏也得到安慰了。</p>
<p>非但如此，一棵棵的植物在行旅人的手植下成長蒼茂了，行人的足跡在悠長的路途上加多起來，那時原野戀成綠油油的一片，行旅人的歌聲在樹林裏　澈開來。</p>
<p>行旅人靜靜地想着，暫時躭在一家古老的施舍裏，夜從古老的圍墻下折進了屋舍，沉重的鐘聲像魔鬼的喘息，因而打斷了他的思想。於是立起身，整一整行囊，呵出一口氣，「為什麼外面的風沙依舊是那麼的大啊！」——但願明天是個晴朗天！</p>
<h3>望</h3>
<p>— 洪野</p>
<p>拉起殘舊的窗帘，對點點繁星，小夜乃有藍色的抒情。</p>
<p>誰家的小樓上輕奏着披雅娜，悽幽的聲音，掀起一絲遊子的懷念，我的眼睛　得遠了。</p>
<p>遙遠的，遙遠的，那海天以外的遠方，是蘊藏了我無限歡笑與唏噓的故居嗎？我懷念着那些森林，雪山，常綠河旁夢一般的往事和草原上的牧羊　……。</p>
<p>多少年了？它們還依稀當年的情景嗎？</p>
<p>我熟望着朋友們的南歸；望他們披着風　，它以滿身辛勞，來自松花江畔；古長城邊，而回到會為我病中消磨了無數歲月的城市里來，告訴我一些將遺忘了的史績。而我，將握着他們的手向他們殷殷垂問：那古寨外的風情還是一樣的迷人嗎？那森林與雪山還依然如舊嗎？還有，還有那常綠河邊牧羊的女郎有沒有頻添了憔悴呢？</p>
<p>於是，我閉上眼睛，諦聆着人海的滄桑，事物的變幻，不變的只是我懷念與鄉愁所　成的夢。</p>
<p>等待着；等待着；等我過完了我的春天，我就要歸去了。披起來時的舊風衣，　起行囊，携着詩稿，向我的每一個朋友和熟悉的每一個小城與街街巷巷道一聲別。於是，輕吹着口哨；翻越過山山水水，歸去了。</p>
<p>今夜，我有訴不盡的情懷。寫吧！寫吧！這無　的美化了的詩篇……</p>
<p>二月十三日　一九四六</p>
<h3>惦念</h3>
<p>— 李揚</p>
<p>當遠離了鄉井，又從一個異鄉走向陌生的土地的時候，懷想遠在天涯的家園，惦念母親，會油然而生。而且不斷地繼續着心情的恬靜。</p>
<p>故土沒有滿天的烽火，但遍野的哀鴻，卻像是到處共鳴着，好些人的希望毀減了，在往昔美好的日子已不再享有了。</p>
<p>南國一向是為人所神往的。但是太好的日子，已不是人所能攀得；只有一些——他們超過人的道德範圍，走向高阜的超人們，他們的生活總是「美麗的」，但也正是最醜惡的。而太多的人們，他們伸出來的手，脆弱的，不，是枯乾的，他們的臉面，他們的瞳孔，已不再豐滿，他們的眼睛沒有一點光亮的「神」，他們連走路的本能都消失了。</p>
<p>家園裏的人們，我想像到他們的臉色該是慘白的，白得使我不敢去正視他的真實。而母親們呢？一切人的母親，她們又何嘗不是在　慄着過日子呢？</p>
<p>一些人來的信，從關山遠阻，涉海渡洋，帶來的一些述說，總像是很悲慘的，黯淡的日子，使他們太哀愁了。</p>
<h3>距離</h3>
<p>— 施清美</p>
<p>即使幾何考零的人，也還知道兩點之間那最短的距離是一根直綫，除此，一切的曲綫連接這兩點的時候，都比那直綫要長。</p>
<p>有一次，我們談起了人與人之間的距離。</p>
<p>那麼，什麼才是人和人之間的距離呢？是地位麼？是智識麼？是財富，身份，或是榮名？再不就是那誰都無法控制的時間與空間？……</p>
<p>然而這一切全不是，這一切都不能影響了人與人之間的遠近：深奧的哲學家覺得愚夫　　一樣有值得思考的價值，相關千金的彩球會經拋打在那個寄食的乞丐身上，聖賢會和強盜攜手，有緣千里能相見，隔着时间的河岸我們想起活在幾千年前的所歡喜或崇拜的人，在沉思中，不妨朝他作一個會心的笑。</p>
<p>人和人之間的距離，也正如同幾何學上的點和綫一樣，那根綫是用「了解」畫成的，當了解成曲綫時，咫尺如同天涯；成直綫時，遠在天邊也像是近在眼前。　一九四六年五月卅日</p>

<h3>雙宿雙飛　（四）（三）</h3>
<p>— 趙清</p>
<p>麗雲敲不開門，却明明知道麗華在屋裏，於是也哭了起來。驚動了墨太太，便走來叫麗華，張弦也跟了來。麗華聽見墨太太的聲音，只好開了門。墨太太看着麗華的眼圈兒紅紅的，以為是他們小姊妹倆鬧　扯了，忙拉住她的手往外走。一面說：</p>
<p>「怎麼好好兒的又同妹妹鬧脾氣？」墨太太半真半假地責問麗華。</p>
<p>麗華不言語，而且揮開墨太太的手，不出去。接着，一陣傷心，不禁又唏噓不已。麗雲本來不哭了，如今看見麗華哭，誤會麗華當真是生她的氣了，因此又哭起來！小姊妹倆哭個不休，哭得墨太太和張弦都沒了主張。</p>
<p>「這兩個孩子都還不懂事，以後還　師父多管教才好。」墨太太笑着說。</p>
<p>這一句話更刺激了麗華，不由自主地「哇」一聲大　起來，弄得墨太太手足無措，心裏着實有些惱，碍着張弦在旁邊，也不好意思發作。便很不高興地向麗華說：</p>
<p>「你，你是怎麼啦？」</p>
<p>麗華依舊不言語，可是也不敢大聲哭了。</p>
<p>「得！你光把麗華拉開。」張弦向墨太太說：「麗華交給我，我負責讓她不再哭就是。」張弦神氣活現地表示很有辦法的樣子。</p>
<p>「好吧：」墨太太說。「只是這孩子脾氣不好，您可得包涵着點！」說罷，墨太太　着麗雲走了。</p>
<p>張弦拍了兩下手，聳聳肩，走向麗華，不住地眨着他那一雙三角眼兒。這眼神使麗華覺得可　，可怕；於是，他邁近一步；麗華便退後一步；退到了床邊，再沒的可退了；他輕輕一舉手，抱起了麗華。這時，麗華早已不哭了，她像受了巨驚似的渾身抖起來。</p>
<p>「真乖！果然聽師父的話不哭了！小寶貝，讓師父親親你的小臉蛋！」說罷，張弦便把自己的嘴唇，凑到麗華的顋上。</p>
<p>「不！不！」麗華嚇得一面把頭往後仰，一面用力推着張弦的下顎。</p>
<p>張弦的下顎，被麗華的小手觸得援援的，同時為她那副俊秀的小白臉所醉，因此，情不自禁地便硬吻了她的頭；他的嘴；她的眼睛！</p>
<p>麗華羞辱地惱了，好忍無可忍地揮動了小拳頭不住打着張弦，但是，這反抗並不能制止張弦的野蠻，直到他滿足了，他才自動地停止那粗暴無禮的行為。然後，他裝作沒事般笑着抱了麗華到石玉樓的屋裏。邊走邊嚷着：</p>
<p>「　　，墨太太！我這個可真厲害！哭倒是不哭了，可是又打起師父來了！」</p>
<p>大家一看，果然麗華還在打張弦。墨太太連忙叱止麗華。</p>
<p>「小華，你瘋啦？怎麼敢打起師父來了？」</p>
<p>「不要緊！不要緊！作師父的理當先挨兩下，否則，以後盡是徒弟挨打，也不公平！」張弦嬉皮笑臉地說。放下了麗華，惟恐小孩子會講出實話，於是連忙又向麗云說：「小雲，快去跟姐姐玩兒吧，可不許又鬧氣！」說罷故作正經地向墨太太使了個眼色。「才不哭，你就別再嚷嚷了。」</p>
<p>麗華楞了一會子，不哭也不走開，臉上顏色氣得發青，終於鼓着最大勇氣向墨太太，又似向這屋子裏所有的人指着張弦說：</p>
<p>「我，我不跟他學戲了！」</p>
<p>然後，麗華後也不回，倔強地疾步走出去，又回到她的屋裏。</p>
<p>「得！老張，人家不要你這個師父了！看哆丟臉！」翁二太太太打趣地說：</p>
<p>於是大家笑了！</p>
<p>張弦這時又羞又悔！羞的是　這孩子當　那麼多的人給了個沒趣，悔的是剛才不該太莽撞，第一天便給了孩子一個壞印象。若果真這孩子不讓他教了，豈不是一笨到手的生意又落了空？</p>
<p>墨太太看見麗華今天這般放肆，不免有些驚訝！怕因此得罪了張弦，於是連忙道謙地說：</p>
<p>「師父別見怪，我說過，這孩子性情不好，都是從小她爸爸給慣壞了，在家裏連我的話都不聽。想着長大了，該懂事點兒啦，誰知道還是這麼個牛脾氣！您可千萬原諒着些兒，我這就去好好教訓她一頓」。說罷，墨太太便忿忿地往外走。</p>
<p>張弦連忙一把拉住墨太太，因為他懷着鬼胎，他怕這件事戳穿了更糟！因此　訕地說：</p>
<p>「讓她去好了，小孩子都是這樣。我這麼大歲數的人，還能同小孩子一般的見識嗎？　不必再去逗她了。過一會就好了。」</p>
<p>大家也幫着張弦勸住了墨太太，大家都以為是麗華不好；麗華性情乖張，只有張弦一個人心裏明白。但又無法替麗華解釋。</p>

<p>生產建設　特輯</p>
<h3>亟宜創設之：　紡織業錠帶工廠</h3>
<p>— 鄭健</p>
<p>（一）引言產業革命以後，紡織業由手工而演進為機器工業，發明改良，時有驚人之成就，乃致技術益精，生產益進。國父有言，建國之首要，為民生，民生問題包括衣·食·住·行·育·樂等，固早在舉國上下深思熟慮中。</p>
<p>衣屬紡織工業，當今建國伊始，政府對于紡織工業復興，已努力整頓，次第恢復生產中，惟對小型紡織工業，未見重視，引以為憾，錠帶工業，是屬於紡織類範圍之一種，亦為紡織廠應用物之一，但它的品質優劣，關係整個紡紗產量成品利害甚大。</p>
<p>（二）歷史一八八七年，歐洲紡織工業先進國家英國著名紡織機械製造廠道勃生廠首先研究改良錠帶，將原用團形錠繩改成扁平形錠帶，試驗成功，經各地紡廠接用後，頗得好評，優點如下：（一）成紗撚度均勻（二）減少機械裝置如原用雙滾筒改為　滾筒傳動（三）減少馬力，節省開支（四）錠帶運轉時間較圓繩為長。減少斷損空錠，增加生產量。一九〇八年歐美各國紡織廠紗錠十之八九，傳動都改用錠帶，以後自紡織工業在我國興起之後，它亦跟着到我國紡織工業界中。</p>
<p>（三）国貨錠帶創立時間我國設立錠帶廠，始於民國三年，　逢歐洲大戰，外貨來源斷絕，此際我　棉紡工業當為中興時代，紡界吳君有鑒於此，從事組織，加緊進行，三年夏籌劃成功，設廠於海上齊物浦路，但當初國人對斯　未予重視，吳君等因資金短少，設備簡陋，織機僅只二十台，幸經其多年之心血克苦經營，出品逐漸改良，而駕於外貨之上，然後得全國紡織採用，聲譽日增，迨歐戰停止，列强各國大量生產之紡織品，運銷我國，從此我國棉紡業，又趨向中落時代，錠帶工業，隨之遜色，幸吳君以勇毅摯誠一賞精神奮鬥，其時該廠增製軍用織物，以增收入，該廠出品錠帶以　　，　　　以輪船為商據，二十六年八一三滬戰發生該廠始迫停頓。</p>
<p>二十七年春，吳君又從事奔走各方設法將該廠重要機件遷入舊法租界，準備恢復生產，後因政府軍需棉織之急，囑再遷移，終於二十七年冬吳君率領全班員工及機器達香港，與當地保安實業公司合資設立棉織廠，擴充範圍，筆者當時在該廠担任工務方面，經六月之久，將原有之全部織機及增添之織機，共合有三百台之多，努力整頓配置完竣繼續生產。</p>
<p>當初因保安公司係製造防毒面具為主，其棉織品　均由棉織部代織製如面具袋背帶，及頭帶管帶等，及至一九三九年德國掀起世界大戰，各國捲入戰禍者甚多，一九四〇年英國國內一部棉織工業改為軍需工業，一部軍需棉織品委托香港各大工廠承造，廠中亦得分配定製織造各帶數量頗多，從事生產，不意到歲暮季節，日人發動太平洋戰爭，該廠燬於炮火，吳君三</p>
<p>十年之苦心經營，已付一炬矣，現吳君在渝擬再計劃恢復斯業，苦於經濟力弱，無法如願，祗有望洋興嘆耳。</p>
<p>方今建國伊始，工業待興之今日，今後全國計劃，實行千萬錠紡廠，則錠帶工業，應設法重整，全國月前從事斯業，僅海上幾家，大都設備未全　生產量少，此後務須及時擴充，努力準備，以供應用，免致外貨充斥，金錢外溢，筆者以為允宜利用敵偽紡織工廠一部份，以供斯業之應用。</p>
<h3>埋頭建設</h3>
<p>— 林漢</p>
<p>幾十年來的我國，受盡了帝國主義者的侵欺與剝削，土地的喪失同然是極令人痛心的一回事，但帝國主義者的無形的枷鎖與無情的魔手以不平等條約下的特權獲取我國市塲，掠奪我國資源，吮吸國人膏脂，幾使我國無形的沉淪到萬刦不復的辦慘境地；八年的殘酷戰事就把在帝國主義者經濟侵略下殘喘而僅有的一點基礎統統摧毀凈盡，戰事勝利結束後的我國，正如大病方瘥的上了年紀的人一樣，急需滋補，調　，如果　　得法，未　不　　「返老為　」的　　起來！</p>
<p>「返老為　」之　為何？一言了之，那便是「埋頭建設」。建設政治，建設科學，建設民生，建設國防，現在正是什麼都得建設的時候了！關於政治，國防我們暫時不談，且說有關科學的「迎頭趕上」與有關民生的「生產建設」。早在十九世紀蒸汽機發明而大量應用的時候，我們就該及時拔步趕上別人，而今別人已飛速的進展到了開發無盡藏的「原子能」時代了，我們還在望　莫及的慢步走，翻閱近數十年的我國科學，實業發達史，我們就從未有過一些超越別人或與人並駕的表現，如此國家怎能不落伍衰該呢？現在僥倖抗戰勝利，一切所謂特種—帝國主義者無形的侵略工具—取銷了，主權完成了，一切建設的障碍都已淸除，而且戰前國貨市塲的勁敵—日本的　　，極有　　　　的　　；這種內在條件與外來環境，都可以說是最　　建設者。</p>
<p>據　，戰敗後的日本人，每日做十四小時的工作，埋頭苦幹，在處心積　的圖謀復興了！記得美能生產局長納爾遜說過「除非東方出現一個新的製造便宜貨的國家以供應戰前日本所擁有的外國市塲，日本的工業不久必會再度執遠東的牛耳，日本必會再度成為一個帝國主義侵略國」，「戰後中國如能代替日本為東方的領導工業國，那不獨是美國之幸，亦且是全世界之福」。這種昭著的見解，我們能否認嗎？日本在掙扎翻身了，友邦在督促我們，愛護我們，我們也該警覺，惕勵，把握這再好沒有的機　，埋頭建設，不要使幾十年來的革命，八年來的苦戰，千辛萬苦換來的千載一時的良機白白的放過。</p>
<h3>活動房屋平民化　美國準備大量生產</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>戰爭結束以後，整個世界上面，除了食糧發生恐慌之外，居住問題，也萬分嚴重。直接遭遇戰爭的國家不必說，像英，法，蘇，德等國，有許多城市，在戰爭斯內，房屋毀損了不少。就是美國，沒有被敵人轟炸過，也在鬧居住荒。</p>
<p>要解決居住問題照目前的情形，當然要建築萬千住屋，但這非但在時間上，人力上不可能，短時期內，豈能完工？就是原料也發生了問題。因為戰爭期內，所有製造建築材料及家具雜物的工廠，都集中力量於製造軍用品。因此，在美國人，以為關於居住荒，最迅速而有效的解決方法，莫如使活動房屋，大量生產。</p>
<p>為應此需要起見，在短時期內，美國活動房屋的大量生產，乃為必然。現在整個美國，已有不少建築公司，在進行或計劃築造活動房屋。而他們所注意之點，一方面是大量生產；另方面是求平民化；同時，還注意到宣傳工作，使一般人對活動房屋，都發生起信用來。</p>
<p>實際上美國的建築公司，築造活動房屋，在戰前早已開始，不過那時還不為人注意。到了戰後的今日，為了居住　　，活動房屋才鴻運當頭，為人注意起來。尤其在幾年的戰爭中，活動房屋於軍事方面，曾有不少貢獻，會　美軍當守望所，營房，及　頭工人宿舍等。所以那時全　生產的活動房屋。完全當做軍用。</p>
<p>戰爭結束了，活動房屋當然要由軍用轉移到民用上面，從此以後，各公司所製的活動房羅，將在市塲公開出售，而式樣方面，也和戰時不同，比較要精緻美觀。其　　，更在可按照你家中的人口，需要何種房屋，而確定一層或兩層，三四間或七八間。</p>
<p>照日前的情形，整個美國，舊的公司在擴展範圍，新的公司在創設，大家集中於製造活動房屋上面。而且注意到平民化，成本力使減輕，售價務必低廉，最簡單的美金二千元光景一座。這在美國，已適於一個普通工人的經濟力量了。競爭的劇烈，任何人可以看得出來。</p>
<p>而且我們相信活動房屋的生產，更不久可由美國擴展到整個世界各地。因為近來各國派人到美國去研究活動房屋者很多。　英國，早已把幾家飛機廠改裝過而製造活動房屋了。因此我們不難想像到再隔幾年，這種新事業準會擴展到世界各國呢！</p>

<p>一個國家治否，政治是否入於正軌，端視政府能否求得法治，人民有無守法精神以為斷。</p>
<p>後方來滬失業工人，前日向社會同請願復工，發生暴動，搗毀玻窗公物，繳除警衛槍械，把持前後大門，禁止人員出入，幸而當局應付有方，致未釀成慘案。這是上海自有工潮以來的最嚴重的現象，前一天吳市長谷部長發表處理工潮辦法五點，僅其中第一點為「嚴辦鼓動工潮者」，第五點為「勞工應絕對遵守紀律」。而為時相隔一日，前天工人請願中，竟至大先是工人揚言，準備棺材担架，其後又大出打手，演成全武行鬧社會局先，毆警奪槍，毀物傷人，無異在對吳市長的工潮政策，作直接的挑釁。</p>
<p>我們固不論此次事件有無其他背景，但彼等行動顯然逾越純粹經濟性工潮的範國，則已無待　述，不錯這批失業工人在後方時，有功於抗戰，有助於生產，來滬後應該予以優先復工。這是工人　理的要求，政府應該先行設法安插，以慰忠貞，可說　無旁貨。但彼等採行這種暴動方式，不但已失却社社會的同情心，而且是完全違犯法紀，阻撓國家走向建設之途的悖謬行為，我們對於煽動行兇主犯，主張嚴懲。</p>
<p>彼等都是從後方來滬的失業工人，在抗戰時間曾經流盡汗血，受盡艱苦　緊守崗位，協助政府，從未罷工怠亦工，未曾演過這套全　行·現在抗戰雖已勝利，但國家尙在最艱困的境遇之中，我們要建立一個燦爛光明的新中國，必有齊一步驟，加緊生產。後方工人更不應忘記了以往的光榮歷史，更不沒辱以往忠貞為國的精神，他們都是新中國的工程師，應該奉公守法，一面用合理的方法，來達到就業的月的，一面切勿感情用事，以致自毀脆弱的國基。</p>
<h3>互商管理概論</h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>因為他肯負起責任，他所說的話，也就成為可以實行的話，因此能够取得下屬們的信仰，使他的決定的方案，能够實行。</p>
<p>我們在商業塲中，時常可以聽見別人說，某人是說話有肩膀的，這其實就是負責任的意思。一個肯負責任的人，對於上級和下級都可以取得信任，更可以使外界人士信任他的一舉一動，因此造就他成功的機會。</p>
<p>三，觀察的能力：要解決各種問題，先要研究問題的中心在什麼地方，因此觀察的能力，也是相當重要的，我們在遇到問題發生的時候，如果不加分析，就看不出問題的所在，一定要把一個問題中的主要中心提出來，這分別問題的中心，就需要觀察的能力。</p>
<p>四，收集資料：一個取決事情，能够準確的人和一個判斷錯誤的人中間的分別，往往是資料收集得充足與否的分別，我們在研究一個問題而需要解決的時候，一定先要把各種有關於本問題的資料盡量收集，作為解決的根據，因為沒有那些資料—事實—憑空臆測，所作的判斷，一定不會準確的。</p>
<p>同時，也要注意到所收集的資料是不晨準確的資料，如果所收集的資料也並不準確，那末所作的判斷，也不能準確了。</p>
<p>五，集中思想：要解決一個問題，在研究的時候，一定要集中思想，決不能隨隨便便，在管理法則上，有一個原理，就是：</p>
<p>「一個能够把事情辦到好的人，就是能够在謀問題解決的過程中，把思想集中在問題上而摒除其他一切雜念的」。</p>
<p>六，理想：理想也是非常重要的，我們在解決一個問題的時候，一定要想到問題的各方面和各種可能的後果，一個沒有理想的能力的人，往往祗能就事情和問題的浮面着想，不免有顧此失彼的地方。</p>
<p>以上各點，都是根據養成健全的心智方面，必須養成的必要條件。</p>
<p>前言</p>
<p>在談到生產機構的各個問題之前，我們可以說一說關於經營工商企業的目的，關於這一點，可以說任何企業的且的，是為着獲得利潤，雖則這利潤的獲得可以分為月前和將來的種，有許多企業，在創設之後，就可以獲得相當的利潤，但是也有一般企業，一定要經過相當時期的刻苦經營，方才能够獲得利潤，也有一種人，為着他們自身的名譽或地位而經營一種事業，他們的目的，不在乎獲取金錢上的利益，但名譽和地位的增高，也可以說是利益的一種，所以在談到一個企業的是否成功的時候，往往要問牠是否能使投資者有相當的利潤。</p>

<h3>新荷出水·遊艇如梭　白門浮世繪卷</h3>
<p>— 南京廿八日通訊　芝楠</p>
<p>南京，似乎是在蛻變中，可是目前所發生的許多事情以及一現象，的確需要高度的警覺，更需要明確的處理。今後，人是越來越多了，如果不趁此早點把一些與市民有切膚之痛的問題解決，將來的應付是極不容易的，我們想在此對首都作一簡明的素描。</p>
<p>玄武湖光　漸人黃金時代</p>
<p>春已遲暮，天氣晴和得可愛，還沒有酷熱，坐飛機田重慶來的朋友們初來此間不免驚訝，眞合了一首詞句：「若到江南趕上春，千萬和春住」。江南天氣的變化，使人易於適應。落雨天如在高樓凭窗遠跳，烟雨迷濛中的石頭城別具一種風姿。雨天在大街行走，不像在重慶泥漿飛濺，車輛過處，行人都要向它「鞠躬」，以雨傘作盾牌，然而此間的小巷在雨天則盡成朮道，非涉水而過不可。</p>
<p>曾經熱閙過一時的舞池，如今是冷落了。禁舞是南京中央日報首先提議的。禁舞令下，舞女，樂師，大班等曾經請願，要求復業，可是結果失望。於是舞場變作音樂茶座，舞女們有的搖身變爲歌女式交際花，有的渴求一個終身的歸宿，有的則溜到上海依舊度其樓抱生涯去了。舞客們難道自甘冷落麽？到夫子廟聽淸唱，是另一種刺激，同時，蓬拆之聲，也時時從私家舞會裏傳出來，與前不同的祇是那些舊日舞女大都玉容憔悴了。</p>
<p>夏天的無形脚步漸漸踅近。市區內，洒水車已經出動，摩登仕女們也帶士他們的太陽眼鏡。吉普卡來去如飛，每天有傷人的消息。每到假日，玄武湖，白鷺洲，遊人如雲。湖上新荷出水，游艇如梭。今後二個月，自然是玄武湖的黃金時期。湖邊的茶室餐廳也應時而生。座上客常滿，游艇以白布作篷，其中安放躺椅小方桌，坐十二人，八人，六人不等，因爲遊人多，索價也高，另外有一種輕便小艇，祇容搭客二人，價錢稍低。</p>
<p>報界幽默　指出屋荒嚴重</p>
<p>最近京市的某報以詼諧的口吻說：「房事嚴重」！用這樣不雅的字眼來形容目前的房荒，叫人看了有點啼笑皆非！還都人員從水上來，從空中來，一天一天的增多，纔到京都，沒有人不爲房子問題感覺頭痛。南京雖大，洋房雖多，可是與他們無關，不少人不得已暫時以小旅館作爲他們的家，也有人情願受點冷淡與閑氣寄居在親友家裏。即使找到房子，一筆押租與行租往往大得嚇人，中產階級以下的人便無力負擔。據官方宣佈：南京市在戰前人口，約有一百三十萬，現在人口僅有七十萬，從這兩個數字看來，南京實在不應該有所謂房荒現象。房十問題的發生，還是人爲的因素爲主。而今，南京擁有房產的人是肥了，而租房的中下級公敎人員是瘦了。</p>
<p>前天晚報上，就登着一條新聞：「房東强迫搬家，房客情急投河」。昨天的中央日報上就登載着該社馬星野社長的一篇「兩個實例，一聲呼籲」。兩個實例是：「第一件事是田吉營某號的房東向我提出：我們一位主筆的住所，月租由四萬元加到三十萬元，押租由十萬元加到百萬元。第二件事是地方法院向我送了，張傳票，要我五月卅日上午出庭，爲的是我的房東要賣掉我所住的房子，說我與他所訂的契約無效，而我沒有讓他出賣」。像這樣的事，的確僅是恒河沙數中的一二。這幾個月來，奸商們「挖屋」，無形中把房價提高了不知多少倍。無怪乎馬社長激昂慷慨地說：「你不能把你每月全部的收入，乖乖地獻給你的房東，而讓你自己同你父母妻子活活餓死！你不能典當你僅餘的衣服，變賣了你僅餘的箱籠，來補滿你每月的房租！如果你不貪汚，你不發勝利財，你有什麼辦法來找房子住？正直的讀者：我一生沒有浪費過ｇ　文錢，我不抽烟，不喝酒，不跳舞，不打牌，我從沒有向道個社會要求非分的享受，而這個社會說：你活該睡在馬路上！而這個社會說：你必須每月向房東獻卅萬元！這個道理，我無論如何是想不通的！」</p>
<p>聽說市政府，警察廳已經開始調査全市的房屋了，遇有空的，就强迫出租，不許待價而沽。這一着雖然遲了點，不過，如果確實做到，也差强人意了。</p>
<p>順流而下　米糧流向上海</p>
<p>掙扎在生活綫上的人是愈過愈多了！生活剝奪了人們的意趣，粉碎了人們的雄心壯志。人們每天都爲着柴米油鹽發愁。黃金與米糧彷彿兩股疾風，盤旋直上！黃金的漲落，市民們沒有直接受它的影響，而糧價的飛騰却使一般人目瞪口呆，頽然歎息！前個月纔三萬，大家已經覺得難以支持，然而沒到半個月的功夫，由三萬再向上跳，每跳一級都使人們的神經緊張一次，四萬大關越過了，接着又過了五萬，看趨勢還要上揚！食米缺乏有以致之麽？不是！正如其他許多醜惡事項一樣，原來是有人暗中操縱！有幾家報紙提出了嚴懲「米蛀蟲」的主張，可是並沒有什麼影響。米價上漲之風如故！升斗小民，顫抖在昂揚的米價下！官方雖然對這一方面也想有所努力，於是有所謂「議價」，然而議價太低了，又造成有市無米的現象，江邊的米乾脆不上來，一直順流而下，流到上海去了。因此議價也在隨時變動中。事實上，如果當局眞拿出辦法，拿出魄力，將糧價穩定定在一個合理的數目上，不是不可行的，然而由於組織不健全，人本複雜，市政富局的努力也近乎徒然，扶得東來西又倒！</p>
<p>臨時參議會在結束時會留下一個令人愉快的尾聲，那就是糧食特派員允臨參會之請，將京市存米七萬石平糶應市。臨參會閉幕快一月了，這件事除了當時予人一點慰安外，後來就沒有下文！最近因爲米價漲得飛快，參議員們想起道張支票，要求兌現，但是時間久了，變化也自然多了。到如今，這七萬石米仍是人們心底的一個謎！</p>
<p>每天淸晨，主婦們提籃去市塲買菜，最低的菜蔬也要三百五十元一斤，肉也漲到一千二了。每天花去的鈔票仍和往常一樣，然而籃裏的菜蔬却日漸减少了。籃裏的重量在天天减輕，主婦心裏的重量却在天天加重。</p>
<p>看的人多　買的人還是少</p>
<p>社會的危機與經濟的危機彷彿一座深潭，市面的繁榮彷彿是水面的浮萍，它遮蓋了一切！</p>
<p>各種各樣的大商店如雨後春筍股出現。開幕時更有從上海請來的女明星剪綵，作爲活廣吿！最近成立的益世廣播電台，似乎成了商家宣傳的根據地，高歌一曲之後，便是一段令人刺耳的介紹，某公司，某商店，貨色如何好，價格如何低，請各界仕女前往光顧云云，完全是一種海派作風！入晚霓虹燈把夜空照耀得五色繽紛，收音機的樂聲悠揚。熱鬧的太平路，中山路上，路人熙熙攘攘。窗橱裏陳列着的幾乎是淸一色的美國貨。新近運到的玻　提包，玻璃　子吸引了摩登婦女們佇立端詳。因爲京滬近在咫尺，凡是從海外運到上海的舶來品，過不幾天，自然會在南京出現。一般人都對洋貨發生莫大典趣，心想一步一趨跟上外國的享受，從未有人意想到洋貨充斥所引起的民族工業危機，可是在另一方面，儘管洋貨滿坑滿谷，但是國民經濟能力遠比戰前低落，加之物價高漲，薪給階級的所得不能隨着比例的增加，所以一般人的購買力便無形中大大削减。任憑玻璃窗樹裏百貨雜陳，音樂喧大，也不能刺激起市面的生氣。看的人多，買的人日少了。</p>
<p>目前南京的繁榮至少可以說有一半建築在奢靡風氣之上。城南夫子廟仍是銷金窟，也是鈔票階級的樂園。入晚小汽車在路邊排列成一字長蛇陣，酒樓飯館，座無虛席。巨商大賈，達官貴人，一擲數十萬金，毫無吝色！看來好像中國並未閙着飢荒，三千萬人面臨着死亡也是「謠言！」</p>
<p>慨乎言之　「南京無文化」</p>
<p>這裏是一片沙漢，沒有一株文化的苗芽！</p>
<p>最近，纔有人在報上感槪萬分似地說：「南京無文化」這並非過甚其詞，知識份子如魚，文化如水，他們需要文化來浸潤，然而偌大的南京，等於一片沙漠，最令人奇怪的是：一般人都沉溺於聲色感官刺激中，對文化的荒凉表示漢不關心。許多文化人從重慶來，對南京似乎不感興趣，一齊集中到上海去了，到今天，這裏沒有一本堅實的刊物，沒有一次大規模的文化活動，却讓一般奢侈享樂風氣掩覆了。沒有一家像樣的書店，不三不四的小書店裏陳列着的多是海派小報和性感的淫書。也沒有一個像樣的圖書館，運動塲。</p>
<p>就以話劇一項而論，萎弱得可憐。唯一的點綴便是唐槐秋的中國旅行劇團，然而也僅是點綴而已，並沒有擁有大量的觀衆。劇團在上演新戲時從沒有將「卡司特「給大家看看，却以「某某小姐參加演出」相號召，前些時更從上海請來某女星意圖吸引觀衆。由這一點看來，足以證明還沒有脫離明星主義，至於上演的塲數也沒有超過二三十塲的。據說中央靑年劇社已經全部遷返首都，正在計劃演出「淸宮外史」或「桃花　」這支戲劇界的生力軍也許可能打破目下的沉寂。</p>
<p>近來，更有些人爲子女的上學問題發愁，固然復員不是復原，然而在敎育方面連復原也沒有做到，單以小學而論，戰前有二百所，學生十萬人，現在僅僅七十所。只能容納學生二萬八。許多人由重慶來，孩子們無處讀書，讓他們終日遊蕩街頭總不是一種敎育！</p>
<p>從各方面看，南京已在漸漸蛻變，然而不可避免的是光明和黑暗，進步與落伍，兩種勢力仍在角逐。如果南京的市民不被利慾遮蔽了理性，其前途必然是益趨燦爛。</p>
<h3>一斤茶葉三斤米　浙江茶業外銷黯淡</h3>
<p>大家知道龍井茶葉是浙江的名茶，但不知道外銷的茶葉並不是龍井，這種浙江的外銷茶，却對於浙江的經濟有着很大的補益。在七十五個縣裏，有五十五個縣市是產茶的，可以說浙江三分之二的人民，至少都是與茶葉有着密切的關係。</p>
<p>平水區綠珠茶　暢銷國外</p>
<p>在國外，行銷最暢的要數平水區的綠珠茶，平水包括紹興，嵊縣，新昌，上虞，餘姚，諸曁，鄞縣，慈溪，奉化，天台和東陽等縣，這些縣裏出產的珠茶，即把茶葉做成一個個小圓球，遂以得名。遂要算遂淳區的綠眉茶，包括淳安，遂安和開化等縣。再要算是溫州區的紅茶，計永嘉，瑞安，平陽，泰順和樂淸等縣。另外，產茶的有臨海，仙居，黃岩，寗海，溫嶺，金華，武義，浦江，永康，磐安，義烏，建德，常山，江山，湯溪，壽昌，靑田，麗水，松陽，遂昌，宣平，雲和，景寗，龍泉，慶元，於潛，孝豐，安吉，分水，昌化，新登，桐廬，富陽，臨安，餘杭，和杭州等縣市。其中產茶面積，據近年的調査，最大的要算嵊縣，計有八萬〇八百八十九市畝，茶葉產量四萬八千一百〇二市担，平水區產茶茶園面積計有二十一萬八千〇九十九市畝，茶葉產量計十三萬八千一百二十五市担，遂淳區產茶面積，計五萬八千七百四十一市畝，茶葉產量計二萬七千七百八十八市擔。溫州區產茶茶園面積，計有二萬七千七百八十市畝，茶葉產量計有二萬三千二百卅市擔。五十四縣市，除餘杭和杭州市外，總產茶茶園面積爲四十六萬五千三百四十八市畝，產量廿七萬七千六百廿九市擔。其中平水·遂淳·溫州三區爲主要的外銷茶，其他各縣市，主要的爲內銷。</p>
<p>歷年戰爭影響　產量迭減</p>
<p>在我國外銷茶全盛時代，全國外銷總量達二百萬擔，第一次世界大戰後，各國紛起種茶並改良茶種，因之，外銷銳減，只有五六萬擔，而我們浙江的外銷茶，要佔廿萬擔，佔全國茶葉出口三分之一。浙江產茶區曾有「一斤茶葉三斤米」之傳請，即是一斤茶葉可以換三斤米，可見當時茶價高於米價。</p>
<p>抗戰後外銷更形減少，內銷因爲戰事的關係，也受着很大的影響，平水區於廿六年是以州餘萬擔計的，廿九年即減產二萬擔，卅年減產十六萬擔，卅一年減產廿三萬擔，卅二年減產廿八萬擔，直至卅五年，朝野呼籲經營茶業，勉强增產，但較廿六年猶減少十八萬擔，合祗十三萬八千一百廿五市擔。其餘溫州，遂淳等區，也比例的減少。</p>
<p>茶農砍了茶樹　淒然落淚</p>
<p>抗戰時期，許多浙江的產茶縣份，半淪敵手，茶農們也無心資敵，含辛茹苦，眼巴巴望着勝剩的到來，現在勝利是來臨了，政府銀行果然都以極大的資金來貸給茶農，甚至有的銀行收購茶葉，茶商們也像漸次地復蘇了。但同時也帶來了陰影，就是物價過份的高漲，使茶葉的成本也特別的提高，從摘葉，製焙到裝箱運出，每百斤總要在十萬元以上，運費尙不計在內，而現在收購茶葉的僅有出五萬元，使茶農感着灰心失望，於是有的把老茶樹砍了，有的　根都掘了，他們面對着砍下來的這許多棵相依爲命的茶樹嘆息落淚，甚至自尋短見的也大有人在。</p>
<p>提出三項步驟　維護茶農</p>
<p>關於收購茶價僅五萬元的理由，也因爲國外茶種改良，製法改良，所以國外的茶葉較國內外銷的茶葉為　，據說錫蘭紅茶，祇賣得美金三角五分一磅，而且色，香，味，遠勝於浙江的紅茶。外國人　茶是提精醒神的，不同於中國人這樣慢慢品評的，所以他們喜歡刺激，外國茶就具備着道個條件。</p>
<p>如果讓我們的茶業自然發展，不加改良，不加研究，那麽終究要被淘汰的。淘汰的結果，單以浙江論，直接從事於茶葉生產的五六百萬茶農，就要失業或流落於別途。悲慘的後果，實在是不能想像的了。</p>
<p>我們希望政府要盡力來維護這許多茶農，第一步，在成本過高的時候，不妨貸欵收購，即一半貸給茶農，一半作爲購茶的代價。第二步，再設法對外宣傳。我國茶種的優良和努力改良的計劃。第三步，要傾全力來改良茶種。，研究製焙的方法。關於這些，政府要獎勵從事茶葉事業的人來經營茶葉。在經營期間，希望能够做到爲茶農設想的成份多，爲自己私利設想的成份少。這樣，或許還有極大的前途。否則，我國國外的茶市塲，果然漸漸地消失了，但國外的茶葉却漸漸在我國的市塲上發現了我們已經碰見很多朋友，他們已很愛飲錫蘭紅茶和外國的茶葉。</p>

<h3>整編是這樣的麽？</h3>
<p>主筆先生：我們誰也不能吾認建國必先整軍，軍隊不整編，國家是無法走上康樂富强的大道上去。現在部隊已按照程序逐步整編了，我們這批因整編而成爲「編餘」的人，心中不免都有這樣電一個感覺：「整編是這樣的麼？這並不是說我們對整編有什麼不滿，或有些微反感。但若以部隊裏直接負責「整」和負處理編餘軍官責任的大官們而論，則不無有失望之感。</p>
<p>整編是精兵主義的實行，應該是賢者在位。可是在卅軍正好藉此「肅軍」，實行所謂「一幹，二幹，三不幹」政策。我們這批非軍長親手訓練出幹一期，幹二期的幹部，當然無條件的「編餘」，尢其那些軍醫人員最苦，若非卅軍看護訓練班出身的，就是資歷悠久，學術兼長，也得一律請出，而用那些未受正式訓練，毫無臨床經驗的來越級升代，來草菅「軍」命！</p>
<p>整編好了，軍裏像送瘟神似的催着快走，到了鄭州，又沒有地方去報到，東鑽西尋，總算在一個旅館的某號房間中找到了負責人，原來負責機關還未能及時組成呢。一直等到到榮陽來，編成了軍政部二五軍官總隊，我們的生活纔算有着落。這其間，在鄭州的十多天時間，我們爲着軍譽和軍紀，只得打腫臉裝胖子，我們的口袋也因之掏得空空的了。最可慘的是拖家帶眷的編餘者，老婆受罪，孩子受罪，臨了有的還得萬方張羅，賣去一些破爛東西來支付棧房錢。旅費當然軍裏也發，據說規定（？）只發三天的，拿到了手，已經不明不白給打了個八折，一共是五千七百六十元整。</p>
<p>我們現在住榮陽曹李，食宿問題，算是解次了。長官們也常來訓話，着眼點都在軍紀，好像編餘軍官是天生不安分的。吃雜量，聽說是糧食「來源無着」，又似乎聽說雜糧（苞穀）與麥子的價錢是一比三，難運國家會在編餘軍官身上打這些小算盤，而來購雜糧給我們吃嗎？衣服，在這樣熱的天氣，編餘的我們，仍是穿着老棉襖，脫不下來，道也是「來源無着」嗎？你不見那些曾經「曲綫救國」的人們，早就卡吱穿上了，我們這些始終走直綫的抗戰餘生，就是現在編餘了，但曾爲國家流過的血汗，總不會一並編掉了吧。如今想要一套粗布單軍服換一換季，還想不到呢！</p>
<p>在部隊整編不公平，在軍官總隊吃着雜糧穿着棉衣，這怎能不使編餘者在心中不刻上一個深深的問號：「整編吳這樣的嗎？」我們籲請全國人士要注意這個「問號」，更希望直接，間接主其事的人，要拿出良心來，本着最高當局的意旨，人民的願望，來確實負責的把這件事弄好，更要各方面多設輔導機關，來對編餘軍官予以幫助和指導，解決其困難，趕快的使我們迅速分別的轉業，深造。退役吧，不要再呌我們爲着生活，爲着前途，而受苦，而徬徨了。</p>

<h3>禁烟</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>沒有人敢說上海現在癥君子已絕跡了罷！</p>
<p>記得在香港，看到印度土是放在牙膏管子模樣的錫管子裏的，每管五錢，外面的裝璜色彩，着買比牙膏還要漂亮。</p>
<p>記得在重慶，一個星籍朋友回答我：我們到任何地方，不愁找不到「抽」，茶館店一坐，不用泡幾開茶的功夫，就拔出路道來。</p>
<p>烟霞客的手段，門檻，不由人不佩服。</p>
<p>前若干日子。上海曾雷厲風行地拘捕過不少烟犯，其中最吸引人注意的，却是三個女人，袁美雲，夏佩珍，和鄭冰如。我們不敢說這是禁烟廣吿，我們却希望能普及，有許多烟犯不必替他們隱姓埋名，至於「有人講話」，那就放鬆一記，大大要不得！</p>
<p>今天，一定又有焚燬烟土烟具這一幕演出，這證明畢竟還有這些撈什子，幾時才可「無可焚燬」呢？</p>
<h3>六朝烟雨話南京</h3>
<p>— 方乃淸</p>
<p>南京自三國，吳，六朝，南唐，明初歷代建都以來，已成我國文物中心。在六朝及明初最盛的時候，城內外的人口，曾經到達近百萬的數字。此後歷經兵燹，至洪楊太平天國失敗，人民飽受戰禍，戶口銳減。在民國十六年以前，全城人口不過三十萬左右，直至十六年夏，國民革命命北伐成功，國府定都南京，都城規模粗具，國臻治理，民慶來蘇，兼以密邇上海，商業易興，人口激增，至十六年冬，南京人口已增至三十七萬有餘。南京在軍閥當政時代，日漸式微，城郭雖大，益形其陋。阡陌連市，廣土自荒。以言道路通衢，多坎坷不平，僻巷則積水如瀦，秦淮河畔，歌舞昇平，祇不過供貪官汚吏，不肖軍人，興來消遣，興盡耀武揚威而己。所謂六朝風流，早無餘跡，可資欣賞。及至華北底定，瀋陽易幟，統一成功，政治漸上軌道，可言建設。市區乃大興土木，公用事業亦漸趨完備，南京遂日形繁榮，據民國二十四年底之南京人口調査，彼時南京市區人口，已達一百零一萬有餘。</p>
<p>南京為我國南北東西之交通要津，其自然環境之優越，稍有常識者，類能道之，不必詞費。自國府定都，至民國二十四年底，此八年又半之短短歲月中，政府雖於內憂外患極艱難之時會，亦未懈建國必先建都之大願。因是建設猛進，市政日新。市區以內新式建築，寬廣馬路，已適合現代都市之要求，見稱世界。習慣繁榮壯麗，都市生活之外交使節，已一變其留戀北京，鄙夷南京之觀念，在南京問舍求地，安於斯矣。設無中日之戰，政府建設大南京之計劃，早已實現。政府建設南京之計劃曾擬劃定政治區，工業區，住宅區，及現代都市應有莊麗偉大幽靜之花園，乃至百獸雜陳之動物園，復絕古今之博物館，包羅萬象之科學館。聞政府建設政治區之計劃，原擬將國府興五院建於一處，國府居中，五院外環，旁臨大路。行政院之對面，則爲各部之部址，政治區之附近，卽爲住宅區，以居公務員。政府之辦公處所，旣集中一處，行政考核，自可收迅速切實之大效，而公務員因作息咫尺，不勞奔波，對於其自身之時間，經濟，精神，均有裨益，可望愼盡厥職，發揚蹈勵，以努力進修。此舉對轉移中國往昔頽敗之政風，實不無影響。惜日本入寇，神京淪陷，此一計劃，亦成刦灰。今常抗戰勝利，欲唱凱旋，人登春臺，一旦和平實現，交通恢復，物價穩定，重建南京之日，卽爲政治區奠基之始，從好處想，固不難也。</p>
<p>南京位於江蘇之西南部，在長江之南岸，東接句容，西望江浦，南通高淳，北對六合。東南與漂水爲界，西南與安徽之當塗接壤。陸路有京滬津浦兩路，及京杭國道之便；水道則有長江內河舟楫之利，交通至便。故南京建都後，舊江寗府屬各縣之農產物，因運銷較易，其農業經濟價值，亦賴提高。農民生活亦視前較佳。不但此也，即在以北鄰近南京之各縣，亦蒙其利。不過南京雖適合百萬以上都市人口居住，但當人口移動性較大之今日，南京之商業組織及習習慣，尙不合今日之要求。尤其是復員期間，還都之前夕。試以四月一月爲例，據查上月政府由空運還都人員約為八千人，由水陸兩路還都者，不足五萬人。南京房荒之程度依然，而南京物價及糧價，從四月中旬起，一日數漲，激漲三分之一或一半。以言米價，四目中旬之米價，上米每石曾跌至二萬一千元，但至四月底時，已漲至每石三萬八千元，而且有價無市。米價之高低，在南京市塲上，影響極大，米價旣漲，百物俱貴，理髮沐浴兩業，即藉口水漲船高，而高抬其價，黑市理髮，有貴至每頭二千元矣。因此，特低薪爲生之公敎人員，及以數千至萬餘元過活之小兵，生活遂愈苦，營養乃愈差。吾人應知上海物價雖高，幸尙有彈性，南京則不然，試以上海吃飯辦法爲例，上海有六百元或五百元之客飯，一百五十元之陽春麵，三四百元可以在小飯攤上果腹。而南京之客飯，每客已近千元，最少亦須七百七十元，光麵每碗必索二百五。南京是首都，講究面子，小飯攤很少，一位幸而來得很遲的小公務員，或者是小兵，冒冒失失上館子，只叫一菜一淸湯，二碗飯，動輙要當塲出醜。因為換不出一千八百元來付賬，只好脤紅　子，駡一聲混賬。其實賬並不混，南京之商人心術也不差。商店漲價理由，是千篇一律為了房租貴，損稅重，米價高，人工昂，或者說上海已經漲價，來貨高。前者令人追念卅二年以前重慶之低生活，後者使人懍然南京鄰近上海這一投機市塲之危機。所以當南京市民及新聞記者聽說糧政特派員即將拋糧，社會部即將在京設食堂，辦宿舍，以及某部將辦合作社，都不由喜上眉梢，喊一聲有辦法。</p>
<p>南京人的口頭禪，還保存了若干什麽「事變」與「和平」，由西南西北還都的人，多歡確沒有忘記那八年抗戰的痛苦，和難得的勝利。有人在繼續茹苦倉　，寗可飲恨於斗室。也有人忘却痛苦，祇覺勝利將儻來的勝利財，不獻國家，不救難民，獻給　前火山上的舞　，以及舞女大班，熱皆餐廳茶室，乃至龜之奴，鴇之母，於是南京舞場，遂越不像話。當華鐙乍明，樂聲甫啓，迷人的歌喉，靡靡響起時，那客多池小的大都會，光明，金谷，或幾家舞池，煞是好看！煞是熱鬧，而且好看熱鬧至無法形容。那些舞客舞伴們，因爲太擠，只好像木杆似的，一根根相對貼着立着，那樣子眞是可憐得寸步難移，動彈不得。與其說是舞塲，還不如呌做火柴盒，來得恰常。毋怪參議會要大聲疾呼地，主張取締，南京舞塲的茶價和其他，的當上海之一半，這玩意比上海廉，所以雅俗共賞，生意特別好。</p>
<p>說到南京的市參議會，又令人陡覺民主前途一片光明。京市臨參會在開會期間，着實放了幾砲：第一砲轟跑了一個「問題代表」，可惜缺少一點下文。第二砲將公共汽軍的票價，打退了一半。（原價二百元，經政府核准一倍，現因參會反對，仍維持原價。）市民對於參會諸公之「能」，及政府尊重民意之「賢」，均有相當之好評。第三砲是看準了糧政特派員掌握的七萬石米，要求特派員拿出來平賣，救救窮人，已經也放中了的。南京市民說：「這才是員主的日子，我們老百姓，現在也懂得民主了。我們以後要求有說得出，做得出的民主。如果說眞話，賣假葉，那就是民主騙子；我們要絞死他。」這時天上機聲隆糧，正有大批國大代表和各黨派專機來到</p>
<p>當還都將成尾聲，馬歇爾特　曁胡佛先生先後到京的時候，接着領導抗戰八年榮獲民族救星　　的蔣主席同時凱旋。中共代表　周恩來等諸先生。也到了南京。當天，（五月五日）下午四時二十分，蔣主席爲了感謝那遠涉甫洋，席不暇暖爲災民造福的美前總統胡佛，特偕馬歇爾特使，王世杰部長，親送胡佛上機，並於胡佛瀕行之前，四人合攝一照。在這一張具有人類偉大慈愛的笑容上，我們新聞記者爲了一部災民獲救，第一次在南京展開笑顏了。</p>
<h3>榮獲金像獎的美男子　雷米倫</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>榮獲一九四五年度美國電影藝術科學硏究院金像獎的美男子雷米倫，而今在好萊塢，比前更見聞名。影迷之中，甚至有痴心少女，鍾情於他，寫信去追求呢</p>
<p>（一）理想中的時代姑娘</p>
<p>最近雷米倫對於女人，曾下過批評。據他說，一九四六式的男子所需要的一種姑娘是帶有婦人典型，尤其要聰　而服裝穿得適時。少女們參加「派對」，必須滑稽，絕忌獨占大衆的注意力，她可能用講故事，會說話的手段來使團體中人竟夜呼嘯，然而等到回家之時，就恢復她的本來面目。</p>
<p>（二）反對婦女狂飲酣醉</p>
<p>雷米倫以主演「失去的週末」而榮獲金像獎，他對於歡喜飲酒的女人，表示反對，而在這部影片中，他就飾一個酒徒，因而演得格外出色。他以爲婦女的偶然飲酒。固不足指責，但在飲而不知所止者，自屬不宜。因女人多飲了酒，比男子更歡喜說話，此時面孔也特別難看。尤其爲女人比男子來得易受刺激感情又豐富，到不能控制惑情時，就會鬧起亂子來。</p>
<p>（三）獲得金獎出於意料</p>
<p>當他拍攝「失去的週末」一片時，沒有想到會獲莫大的成功，所以榮獲金獎，出於意外。也許爲飾了一個醉漢，會感動一般不幸的酒徒。雷米倫在好萊塢已聞名十三年，而今他拍完了第十五部影片。他的酒量很好，常他走進酒店，吩咐拿薑酒和苦酒來時，侍者會叮着他看的。他如果在飲酒，連影迷也有些爲之不安呢，人們都盼他走進餐室，面色不紅，所以每飲必為　酒苦酒之類。</p>
<p>（四）夫婦之間極端和好</p>
<p>他近年來的成功，除了獲獎之外，另一種測騐，是打電話和電報給他的人正逐見增加。但他照爲除了整個世界崇拜獲獎的人以以外，在自己和以前根本沒有什麼不同。影迷中一般痴心少女，追求他的固大有其人，但他和妻子倆感情很好，他六歲的孩子，常他是一個英雄，因爲最近在一張西部影片中曾看見他出現。目前他唯一的志願，是完了他七年的合同後，抽出假期，到野外去垂釣，打撈和滑雪，未米的幾個月，他預備帶了妻女，到南美去作假期旅行。等到回好萊塢時，或許可試試他新打的一艘四十呎長的漁船了。</p>
<h3>戀愛與錢</h3>
<p>— 曹作漢</p>
<p>戀愛的先決條件，是金錢；而不是眞情與善意。</p>
<p>我還是年靑的不知愁滋味的小伙子，所以在偶然的不經意中，會受了天性的支配而墜人桃色的網。如醉如痴的一陣子，幾次夢醒以後，才得到如此這樣的一條定律。心靈所担受的創痛又是如何的殘酷，而定律又是如此的歪曲。</p>
<p>五年前在我敎書的時候，曾爲一假女孩子所愛，所謂人心都是肉做的吧，經她半年多的追逐，我也不自覺的愛上了她，又是兩年多的往還，她嫁人了，其時我正在失業中，兩人含情默默的分開，咱們都沒有一句話，她現在已做了母親了，據說還是很懷念我。</p>
<p>我想經濟力量影響於職業女子的心情或者會好一點吧，因此不久又認識了一個職業女子，這次是經人介紹，由我主動，因我想從實騐中認識戀愛的眞諦。</p>
<p>經過情形是很好，去年咱們訂了婚。</p>
<p>訂婚以後，有位別了多年的老友來看我，閑談中談起前一次的離合，他問我原因。</p>
<p>「沒有原因，這算不得是失戀，他沒有要扔掉我，我沒有要扔掉她，但，咱們得分開，而也在默默中分開了。」我再想了一想，補充着說：「如勉強要找原因的話，大槪是因爲我貧窮，Kiss不能當飽，所以她離開我原是合理。」</p>
<p>經注制度和我開了次玩笑；她對，我也不錯。</p>
<p>最近我又爲了良心上不滿於主管者的作風，自動的辭了職；她的環境仍是如恒，可是對我的情緒，已在逐漸的變，我心領神會得很　楚。</p>
<p>難道眞的是：戀愛的先決條件，是金錢，而不是眞情與善意。這次玩笑，我可受不了，人總是感情動物，所幸近來我又有了事，但女人的眞價我又得重新估計了，在這裏想冒昧的勸一句，在事業未成功前，還是槍斃戀愛吧。</p>

<h3>我們不願「屈死」</h3>
<p>— 余謙</p>
<p>馬路如虎口，當中不可走。現在的上海灘，眞是更要時時刻刻足下當心！</p>
<p>一個初來上海的人，冷不防背後「彭」一聲　砲，直覺地煞住脚回頭一看，就在這當兒，一部風馳電掣的十輪大卡車駕到，於是陰曹地府多了一名「屈死」。</p>
<p>這是假想的一幅畫，你說沒有可能嗎？</p>
<p>市長大人啊局長大人啊：我們與其需要那裝着擴大器的交通巡邏車，在馬路上兜兜風，喊兩聲「過馬路當心」：我們不如需要禁止那些在市區內橫衝直撞的吉普卡，十輪卡，沒有必要在市區內行駛的各種軍用車！</p>

<h3>某巨頭　臉色四變</h3>
<p>— 馮憶</p>
<p>棉花紗布大王，榮德生，自被山大王「釋放」歸來後，內幕複雜，迄難「大白」，雖榮家語人，此次出綁純係「無條件」，但據熟悉內幕者言：此係「啞子吃黃連」，有說不出之苦衷在。</p>
<p>警局方面曾爲「大王」之事，煞費苦心，而今榮雖歸來，但仍欲偵知來龍去脈，蓋深恐此風一長，將益增「人怕出名猪怕肥」之危險也。</p>
<p>有人謂：榮家之難，難在做人難，三個山大王要錢要得緊，警察局要人要得緊，榮家　　要　　，　今的問題，例不在於「財去人安」？却在於警察局滿想　點顏色出來，於是盜匪去了警察來，榮家依然有苦難說。</p>
<p>有人說：這年頭沒有錢的「要想活命」大閙罷工，大鬧社會局，可是有了錢的却亦爲了「要想活命」而鬧得雞犬不寧。前後兩「鬧」，雖然形式不同，而意義則一，同樣「要想活命」，「鬧」出許多事情來。</p>
<p>操縱米糧，當局平具決心，中央特派大員，來滬澈查，風聲緊急，米商最初尚以為官場做事，三斧頭之後，當可無事，不意此番却是眞刀眞槍，至此才吃一驚。米商某巨頭曾被中央大負一度傳詢，首問「操縱者究係何人」？某巨頭臉上一「紅」，瞠目不知所答。大員繼之緊逼一句，「你說是誰」？於是某巨頭看看形勢　緊，臉色「二度」，　紅轉「白」，但仍守口如瓶，未敢作　　。大員至此大愁，「你不說我先槍斃你！」，某巨頭雖胸有成竹，一聽槍彆之聲，到底要錢者更要性命，至此不免心中着　，臉色「三變」，由白轉「靑」。大　　復袖出主席手諭，事情已臨最後關頭，某巨頭閱後，祇覺眼前　星亂冒，不由得臉色「四變」，由靑轉「黑」。當時情景，油時震說，正是：大員急令令口喝三聲響，巨頭汗涔涔臉容四鈀變」。</p>

<p>袁履登最多判處無期徒刑，早在一般人意料之中；袁爲海上「三老」之一，「老」而死，不成其爲賊矣。</p>

<h3>Assume Responsibility and Improve Politics; Expedite the Completion of North China's Restoration: Chairman's Admonition During Memorial Week in Beiping City</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 2nd Dispatch] Chairman Chiang remained in Beiping on the 2nd, continuing to summon various department heads. At 11:00 AM on the 2nd, various institutions specially held a grand Memorial Week one day early, inviting the Chairman to personally give an admonition. After the meeting, he went to inspect the Beiping Pacification Headquarters. Shortly after, he returned to the headquarters. From 3:00 PM, he summoned the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Special Envoy Wang Jichen and other personnel from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. At 4:00 PM, he summoned Chief of Staff Wang Hongshao of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, Secretary-General Xuan Yishan, Director of Political Affairs Wang Jiesan, Chief of Staff Song Kentang of the Eleventh War Zone, Deputy Chiefs of Staff Lu Wenzhen and Gao Songyuan, Director of the Political Department Zhao Kefu, Deputy Director of the Beiping Police Bureau Zhu Nanping, and others for an admonition. In the evening, there was a tea party to meet with local gentry, celebrities, and guests in Beiping. Tou Weigou, who had rushed back to Beiping, was specially invited to host. The reporter saw the Chairman using a blue pen to circle the names of those permitted to be received by Ms. Sheng (Soong Mei-ling, Chiang's wife), including Wan Fulin, Ma Zhanshan, Feng Qinzai, and Li Shouxin. In addition, Mrs. Zhang Zizhong was also permitted to meet with the Chairman and Madam tomorrow morning. The Chairman's actions in Beiping are meticulous and swift. In just a few days, all aspects have been taken care of. Each room in the headquarters is equipped with an electric bell, and the attendants are prepared to act at any moment. Within nine minutes of the bell ringing, they are ready to depart.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 2nd Dispatch] Chairman Chiang attended yesterday's expanded Memorial Week in Beiping City on the 2nd, giving many instructions regarding politics in North China. The key points were: (1) The military and political steps in Beiping and Tianjin are quite disorganized and should be unified in the future. Director Li of the Pacification Headquarters is asked to take responsibility. (2) Political conduct urgently needs to be reformed, transforming passivity into activity, and seeking merit instead of avoiding fault. (3) The reception work in Beiping and Tianjin is too disorganized, with many unreasonable phenomena. A thorough investigation should be conducted in the future, and each senior official is only allowed to enjoy a five-room residence. (4) Key personnel who collaborated with the enemy in the past must be investigated. (5) The city government must pay attention to the health of citizens, improve public health, and quickly remove accumulated soil throughout the city. (6) The quality of police officers in the police bureau is uneven and should be improved. The central government will increase funding for police administration. The admonition lasted one hour. The grand Memorial Week for party, government, and military affairs on the 2nd was held in Huai Ren Tang in Zhongnanhai. More than 200 personnel from the party, government, and military departments of Beiping, Tianjin, and Baoding attended. Sun Lianzhong arrived at the venue at 9:00 AM to take care of arrangements. At 11:00 AM, Chairman Chiang, accompanied by Li Zongren and his entourage, arrived. The Chairman was unarmored, wearing a military uniform, and looking radiant. All personnel stood up and paid respects to the Chairman upon his arrival. The Chairman gladly returned the salute and then presided over the meeting, which adjourned around 12:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 2nd Dispatch] The party, government, military, and police circles of Beiping held a joint Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week at Huai Ren Tang at 11:00 AM this morning. After Chairman Chiang led the ceremony in accordance with the rituals, he delivered an impromptu speech. He first emphasized that Beiping is one of the most important cities in the country, and all comrades working here should be aware of the gravity of their responsibilities. Currently, the restoration work in North China is not progressing as expected due to economic difficulties and transportation obstructions. However, within the possible range, we must take the initiative to find ways to overcome difficulties and have a spirit of perseverance and fearlessness of hardship, so that we can complete the great task of national construction after the destruction. Chairman Chiang then pointed out that the current mentality of general civil servants seeking only to avoid fault rather than striving for merit is detrimental. Only by working hard and bearing complaints can affairs be promoted. Finally, the Chairman gave concrete instructions on the economic, educational, health, and police aspects of Beiping City, especially on the health aspect, believing that the police bureau must assist in mobilizing the public to automatically remove accumulated waste and request cleanliness in order to be effective. The speech lasted about forty minutes.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 2nd Dispatch] Chairman Chiang and his wife are scheduled to return to Nanjing by plane tomorrow. The local women's association plans to present Madam Chiang with a silk banner to publicly praise her contributions to the country.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 2nd Dispatch] Chairman Chiang specially awarded 500,000 yuan to all police officers in Beiping today to commend their excellent service since the recovery of the city.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Sichuan Grain Arrives in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd Dispatch] In order to alleviate the grain shortage in Nanjing and Shanghai, a meeting instructed the Ministry of Food to transport grain on credit from Sichuan Province to Nanjing for relief. The first batch of 220 tons of Sichuan grain arrived in Nanjing yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, transported by the Minfu, Yumin, and Sanlun steamers. At the same time, a group of personnel returning to the capital also arrived in Nanjing.</p>
<h3>The Nation Reaches a Critical Juncture of Prosperity and Decline; the Overall Situation Can No Longer Be Delayed; the Resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference Must Be Implemented Swiftly</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd Dispatch] According to a certain important official who told our newspaper's reporter, based on observations of various news from inside and outside the passes over the past week, the most noteworthy issue at present is no longer the so-called issue of war or peace, but the issue of the nation's prosperity and decline, and the survival of the Chinese people. We should know that since the victory, the communists have been scheming to seize power, first destroying roads inside and outside the passes, expanding their armies, destroying industrial and mining production, and obstructing the government's restoration of order, military reorganization, and restoration of transportation, resulting in the decline of production and soaring prices everywhere, creating today's severe economic crisis, and even openly using force to obstruct the government's takeover, occupying the areas along the Chinese Changchun Railway, stealing political power under the guise of public opinion, not only hindering the government's fulfillment of its obligations under Article 4 of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance regarding the joint operation of the Chinese Changchun Railway, but also plunging tens of millions of compatriots in the Northeast who have been oppressed by the enemy and puppets for fourteen years into a desperate situation due to the destruction of transportation and the shutdown of factories. Although the government has repeatedly sought peace through concessions and convened consultative conferences to jointly seek solutions for the country, the communists have deeply hidden their evil intentions, outwardly displaying peace while secretly plotting to seize power, going back on their word and changing constantly regarding the resolutions of the consultative conferences, such as the cessation of hostilities and the restoration of roads, and the agreement on the government's reorganization after the convocation of a national assembly. This is truly unfathomable. Their intention is nothing more than a treacherous tactic of turning the situation upside down in order to achieve the purpose of delaying the current situation, dragging the country into fragmentation, exhausting the government, plunging the people into misery, and confusing allies who eagerly hope for China's peaceful unification, so as to achieve their goal of taking advantage of the situation to enrich themselves in terms of economic and political power. Fortunately, the government, the people, and friendly allies now have a new understanding of the current situation, and deeply feel that only by restoring national transportation and reorganizing and unifying the armed forces can the current economic crisis in China be saved. If we continue to delay and make mistakes, not only will our international status decline day by day, but if the overall situation continues to deteriorate due to prolonged transportation blockages, agricultural abandonment, factory closures, and industrial decline, and once natural disasters and man-made disasters combine to torment us, our 450 million compatriots will have nowhere to die. If the Chinese people recognize this crisis that must be quickly averted, they should know that the measures currently taken by the government are necessary. What the government currently hopes from the communists, such as the restoration of transportation and the reorganization and unification of the armed forces, are all matters that were resolved and awaiting implementation by the first government consultative conference. If the above resolutions cannot be implemented, what is the use of holding another hundred consultative conferences? The official continued, "Whenever our government reaches a critical juncture, its decisions concerning the great plan to save the nation have never been indecisive. He deeply believes that after the Chairman returns to Nanjing, all discussions must be based on this principle for research and implementation, so as not to waste time.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 2nd Dispatch] A reliable source confirmed today that General Marshall has drafted a new peace plan to resolve the civil strife in the Northeast, but the details are kept secret.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Da Gang Daily stated in today's war bulletin: "The Chairman has formulated three new suggestions for resolving the civil strife in the Northeast: (1) Stop the National Army's actions, (2) The Communist Army withdraws from Harbin and Qiqihar, (3) Send administrative officials to the areas controlled by the Communist Army."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 2nd Dispatch] Luo Longji, a spokesman for the Democratic League, stated: "Today, measures are being drafted to break the deadlock between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but the details are not yet convenient for publication. The scope of the dispute between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is not as extensive as generally believed. Both sides have agreed that they must face the difficulties. The Democratic League and Marshall are now making every effort to break this deadlock. The attitudes of both sides are not completely devoid of hope." Yu Dawei, the newly appointed Minister of Transportation, also remained silent about the content of his talks with Marshall when meeting with others, only stating: "General opinions have been exchanged." Yu also stated that the Communist Party should fulfill its treaty obligations to restore transportation.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 2nd Dispatch] Reliable sources from both sides of this issue stated today that Marshall has a new peace plan [to reconcile the demands of both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party], but it is believed that the opportunity for lasting peace remains weak.</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang and Others Pass Through Hankou Heading East</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 2nd Dispatch] Feng Yuxiang, Wang Chonghui, Li Jishen, Zou Lu, Wang Baoxing, Chu Fucheng, and other gentlemen, as well as overseas Chinese tycoon Li Tiefu, etc., arrived in Hankou at 8:00 PM last night from Chongqing on the Minlian steamer. After inspecting the overseas Chinese district and the urban area for a week, they rested at the Xuan Palace Hotel, and met with many friends here. Director Cheng of the Pacification Headquarters and Garrison Commander Peng Shan both visited and hosted a banquet. They returned to the ship for the night at 12:00 AM and departed east to Nanjing at 7:00 AM this morning.</p>
<h3>Rumor that Fu Zuoyi Arrives in Beiping</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 2nd Dispatch] It is rumored that Fu Zuoyi arrived in Beiping yesterday to meet with Chairman Chiang and report on the recent situation in Suiyuan Province. He will return to the province within days.</p>
<h3>National Army Advancing Towards Harbin in Several Columns; Xiong Shihui Inspects Changchun from Shenyang</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd Dispatch] Army Headquarters: The main force of the Northeast National Army, 30,000 men, has been selected to enter the strategic zone on the Chang-Ha Railway in Jilin Province, near the Erdaohezi. All strategic areas have been captured. The National Army can now enter Harbin at any time. According to news from Beiping, the Central Government is currently expressing plans to hold Harbin firmly, but this plan has not been noticed by the people. However, the Communist Army is indeed making a desperate struggle in Anshan and other places.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Northeast National Army Headquarters, 2nd Dispatch] General Du Yuming's advance guard is advancing towards Harbin. According to authoritative sources here tonight, they discovered that the Communist Army has blown up a major bridge on the Songhua River, 75 miles south of Harbin.

<h3>Government Decides to Follow Signed Agreements; Military Reorganization Ratio Unchanged; Chairman Instructs on Military Mediation Work</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 1st Dispatch] (Delayed) After Chairman Chiang arrived in Beiping, he summoned the government representatives of the Military Mediation Department, and gave important instructions regarding national mediation work. These instructions essentially represent the government's attitude towards the current situation. The main points are: (1) The government sincerely strives for national peace and unity. (2) The government will absolutely abide by all agreements and protocols signed with the Communist Party. (3) The Communist Party must also fulfill the agreements and protocols that it has signed. Regarding the Northeast issue, the government believes: (1) According to the Sino-Soviet treaty and the truce agreement, the National Government should have the exclusive right to take over sovereignty in the Northeast. (2) The Northeast Communist Army should comply with the military reorganization agreement, concentrate and await reorganization. The ratio of military reorganization in the Northeast should not be changed. When asked if the government intended to designate the area north of the Xing'an Mountains as a defense zone for the Communist Army, the spokesman replied that he had not heard of this, but if the Communist Army agreed to the reorganization, the government should designate a concentration point. In addition, the reporter learned today that the Executive Headquarters has not strengthened the preparation for mediation in the Northeast. Recently, the Communist Party proposed sending a group to Changchun, which was supported by the US, but the government has not yet agreed. The government stated that when the Communist Army attacked Changchun, the government proposed sending a group to Changchun, which was rejected by the Communist Party, so it seems unnecessary now. Another government spokesman told reporters that the Northeast is not an apple, but a plate of apples, which can be sliced and eaten separately, but the plate cannot have a missing piece, implying that the sovereignty of the Northeast cannot be divided.</p>

<h3>"Return the Government's Army to the State"--Minister Bai Talks about the Organization and Tasks of the Ministry of National Defense</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd Dispatch] The Ministry of National Defense was officially established on the 1st, and the first Minister, General Bai Chongxi, has taken office. Bai told reporters about the organization and tasks of the ministry, stating: "The military period of our revolution has reached its final stage. Therefore, we are now preparing to implement constitutional government, abolish the Military Affairs Commission, which is separated from the Executive Yuan, and establish the Ministry of National Defense, which is subordinate to the Executive Yuan, to achieve the revolutionary goal of 'returning the government's army to the state.' Moreover, because the military is governed by the government, warlike soldiers like those in Germany and Japan will never have the possibility of rising to power. This is truly a fundamental and unshakable system for the nation for centuries to come." The organizational spirit of the Ministry of National Defense has two major characteristics: (1) To closely link military administration with politics, and to coordinate political strategy with military strategy. (2) To unify military administration and military command of the army, navy, and air force. Xiang also listed the current military tasks of the Ministry of National Defense, which are based on the constitution, in which the head of state commands the army, navy, and air force. Therefore, all matters concerning military command are ordered by the head of state and planned and directed by the Chief of Staff. The implementation of the National Defense Force regarding military administrative matters, within the scope of decision-making, is based on the orders of the Executive Yuan by the Ministry of National Defense, and is planned and directed by the Chief of Staff. The important tasks of the current National Defense Force are: (1) Establish a national defense plan. The Ministry of National Defense is the national defense advisory body to the President of the Executive Yuan. All national defense measures are initiated by the Ministry of National Defense or first handed over to the Ministry of National Defense for planning, and then ordered to various departments to complete them on schedule. (2) Develop national defense industries. Without industry, there is no national defense. The Ministry of National Defense will propose a comprehensive plan for the degree and speed of development of national defense industries in accordance with national defense needs, so that it can be gradually completed. (3) Establish the most modern national defense force. Although there are many national defense tasks, the military is ultimately at its center. The Ministry of National Defense will establish a plan to equip and improve the academic and skill levels of officers and soldiers, and supervise its implementation. (4) Scientific research and general science are now inseparable. The Ministry of National Defense intends to directly contribute to national defense science.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 1st Dispatch] (Delayed) After Chairman Chiang arrived in Beiping, he summoned government officials in charge of the military mediation department and gave important instructions regarding the national mediation work. These instructions basically reflect the government's attitude toward the current situation. The main points are: (1) The government sincerely strives for national peace and unity. (2) The government will absolutely abide by all agreements and protocols signed with the Communist Party. (3) The Communist Party also [must] implement its already signed agreements and protocols. Regarding the Northeast issue, the government believes: (1) According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty and the truce agreement, the National Government should have the exclusive right to receive the sovereignty of the Northeast. (2) The Communist Army in the Northeast should comply with the military reorganization agreement and concentrate to await reorganization. The ratio of military reorganization in the Northeast should not be changed. When asked if the government intended to designate the area north of the Xing'an Mountains as a defense zone for the Communist Army, the spokesman replied that he had not heard of this, but if the Communist Army listens to the reorganization, the government [will] designate a central location. Furthermore, a reporter found out today that the Executive Department had not yet strengthened the preparations for mediation in the Northeast. Recently, the Communist Party suggested sending a small group of twenty-eight people to Changchun, which the U.S. supported, but the government has not yet agreed. The government side stated that when the Communist Army attacked Changchun, the government side proposed sending a small group to Changchun, which was rejected by the Communist Party, so it does not seem necessary today. Another government spokesperson told the reporter that the Northeast is not an apple, but a plate of apples. It can be cut into slices and eaten, but the plate will not be a plate if there is a defect. This is to convey that the sovereignty of the Northeast cannot be divided.</p>

<h3>The Culprit Who Disturbed China: An Observation of Sakai's Trial by Our Beijing Correspondent Zhang Ming</h3>
<p>The mastermind of the July 7th Incident, the spark that ignited the world, this unforgivable butcher—Sakai Takashi, recorded as Case Number 5 of the Detective Office—is being tried in Nanjing!</p>
<p>The Military Tribunal of the Army Headquarters is trying its first case today, and the one marking the beginning is precisely the culprit who has disturbed our land from the Changbai Mountains to the Yangtze River for the past fifteen years. After this news spread, many people hoped to witness the scene of this butcher being sanctioned, especially the journalists, who had already contacted for admission tickets to the hearing.</p>
<p>At eight in the morning, people began to arrive one after another. The military headquarters, a place usually heavily guarded and off-limits to idlers, was today taking in crowds of people in various forms of plain clothes. The opening of the trial was scheduled for nine o'clock but was delayed until nine forty. The presiding judge, Shi Meiyu; assessors Meng Chuanda, Gao Qimai, and Bao Qiwei; prosecutor Chen Guangwei; and the secretary and translators arrived at the court. Soon after, Sakai arrived at the court escorted by two soldiers and two court officers. This old man was sixty years old. Although thin, he still tried to appear energetic. When he entered, his feigned composure seemed to emanate an indelible air of murderous intent, conveyed through the gaze behind his nearsighted glasses. He was wearing a dark blue serge Western suit and a khaki shirt, but the collar was unbuttoned, and the tie was not tied. He had short hair, a short beard, and rimless glasses, with a frighteningly gaunt face. His build was naturally not tall but not too short. After standing in the defendant's seat, he first put down the two books he had brought. Then, the photographers began to compete for shots, and the flashes of light flashed in all directions, leaving countless photos of this unforgivable war criminal in the soft whirring of the cameras, adding an air of mystery.</p>
<p>During the opening of the trial, he stood the whole time. While listening to the prosecutor read the indictment, he looked around from side to side, trying to find his sympathizers in the crowd. At the same time, because the full text of the indictment was very long, the reading took twenty-five minutes. First, it was read in Chinese, then in Japanese. He pondered as he listened, and took out paper and pen to take notes. Sometimes he smiled with an extremely contemptuous and cunning attitude, as if these were not surprising at all. In this way, it continued for nearly an hour.</p>
<p>The interrogation began. As usual, he was first asked his name and age. He was from Guangdong. He lived in Tokyo. A sixty-year-old man from Guangdong, living in Tokyo. An old man who should have compassion in his heart. But he had been a butcher, and he had not admitted his mistakes or awakened even now.</p>
<p>Regarding the questioning about his past positions in the war against China, he sometimes responded with "Yes," and sometimes said, "I don't remember clearly, maybe yes," or perhaps said, "Probably yes," all delivered with a cunning attitude. Under this atmosphere, the interrogation continued for a whole morning. Everyone felt unhappy, and a fire-like rage almost burst towards him, but he was still so slow and composed.</p>
<p>One exchange went like this:</p>
<p>"Do you admit that the three northeastern provinces are Chinese territory?"</p>
<p>"They are Chinese territory."</p>
<p>"Since they are Chinese territory, why did you force our military leaders to recognize the puppet Manchukuo as 'Manzhouguo'?"</p>
<p>"I hope you can provide evidence."</p>
<p>The presiding judge then declared: There are many pieces of evidence, and he told him the time, but he still responded with an unbelievable attitude.</p>
<p>Regarding his repeated participation in invading our country, he said, "I am a soldier, I only know how to obey orders, and the responsibility should be borne by the national government." He repeatedly said, "The July 7th Incident was not a war, and the Japanese also did not want war. The Japanese were asking for survival." He also said, "This is all accumulated misunderstandings," completely denying the truth. The prosecutor once retorted, "Do you demand survival by making others unable to survive?" In reality, this is a kind of sophistry. He wants people to listen to him and allow him to take what he wants, so that he, an individual, can live on alone.</p>
<p>When asked how many Chinese people he had slaughtered, he said he didn't know at all, and even said, "I have always instructed my subordinates not to kill people casually."</p>
<p>Regarding his crimes, the court divided them into the following parts:</p>
<p>The first part concerned all the acts of aggression in North China before the "July 7th Incident," for which the defendant was the main instigator. The second part was that the "July 7th Incident" itself was mainly orchestrated by the defendant. The third part was all the various crimes committed by the army during the war, such as raping women, mass killings of Chinese and British people, and enslaving the people.</p>
<p>The first part of the aggression involved economic, political, and military aggressive actions, all of which were supported by various pieces of evidence sufficient to prove it. The second part was that the defendant created a military fait accompli, forcing the outbreak of war. The third part involved the massacres in Guangzhou and Hong Kong, which were too horrible to describe. If we count the number of people killed as 500,000, then only four or five war criminals can be named. Isn't it said that one person's life is exchanged for ten thousand?</p>
<p>But he repeatedly quibbled, and when the trial continued in the afternoon and the debate began, the defendant completely and falsely denied everything.</p>
<p>But the prosecutor said this: Our reasons are: (1) On behalf of millions of Chinese compatriots who were brutally murdered, we request the presiding judge to sentence the defendant to death; (2) For the threat to the survival of the nation and the suffering of the Chinese nation, we request the presiding judge to sentence the defendant to death; (3) To ensure lasting world peace, please sentence the defendant to death. When this paragraph of reasoning was translated into Japanese and sent into his ears, he immediately became somber, and his eyes shook blankly, no longer having the dismissive arrogance he had in the morning. In his deceitful brain, he still has a very good pattern of aggression!</p>
<p>But he continued to make illegal demands to the presiding judge: (1) Please allow a Japanese to be the translator; (2) I hope to present concrete evidence and extend the sentencing date. The presiding judge immediately rejected his request and did not grant it.</p>
<p>Next, Wang Long, the defense lawyer appointed by the court for the defendant, stood up to defend him, debating from both factual and legal perspectives, but neither could be established.</p>
<p>Finally, the defendant tried to salvage the situation, saying that everything was still due to threats. Then the prosecutor said, "China's military strength is not enough to defend itself, how can it threaten the survival of the Japanese? China is almost equal to the Japanese market. How can it pose an economic threat to the Japanese? The 'July 7th Incident' was clearly created by Japan single-handedly, how can you say you don't know?"</p>
<p>This insidious, cunning, and evil-doing person, because he obtained his error from his nerves, did not submit, but could not help but bow to the principle of public justice, ending the interrogation.</p>
<p>The presiding judge announced that the verdict would be announced on the 30th, but afterwards, after consultation among the judges, it was deemed unnecessary to debate further, and the date was temporarily changed, but it is said that this case must be cleared before June 15th!</p>
<h3>New Scientific Discovery: Penicillin Can Be Chemically Synthesized</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Report from the China Society of Natural Sciences:</p>
<p>(1) In the past, the production of penicillin relied on extraction from the cultivation of fungi, resulting in high costs and inability to be universally available. Recently, through the research of the Medical Research Group of the U.S. Scientific Research and Development Bureau and British medical research, crystalline penicillin can be produced from streptomycin. If mercury is added to remove a molecule of carbon dioxide, it can become a kind of cephalosporin. Its chemical structure has been clarified, and it is expected that it can soon be synthesized artificially through chemical methods, without having to rely on the production of cephalosporin fungi anymore, and its cost will definitely be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>(2) The Army Department invented a mapping device during the war that was extremely precise. It could be placed behind soldiers or any other objects and automatically record direction and distance based on movement, automatically forming large-scale maps. The scale could be from one ten-thousandth to one five-hundred-thousandth. This device had a great effect on military affairs during the war, and will also be widely used in geographical surveys and exploration work in the future.</p>
<p>(3) The Shell Oil Company has invented an insecticide that is more powerful than "DDT," called Velsicol, a hydrogen carbon oxide compound. According to the experiments of Professor Coles of the University of Illinois, the killing power of this drug is three to four times greater than "DDT" for killing flies, and five to ten times greater for killing grasshoppers, which has a great effect on agricultural work.</p>

Traitor Chen Gongbo wore a blue cloth long gown, and traitor Chu Minyi wore a silk short jacket and pants. Traitor Chen Bijun wore a gray cloth cheongsam. All of them looked extremely calm. They arrived at the No. 3 Prison at ten thirty. They were first led into the lawyer reception room, where the warden, Chen Songnian, inquired about their birthplaces and years. Traitors Chen and Chu were respectively imprisoned in cells No. 1 and 2 in the Li section, while traitor Chen Bijun was imprisoned in the women's prison. More than ten pieces of luggage were delivered by their servants. All circles here believe that the execution date for traitors Chen and Chu is not far off. The reporter went to visit President Sun of the High Court in the afternoon, but he had gone to Songjiang for inspection. Therefore, he turned to visit Chief Han. The answer to the question of whether the judgment books for traitors Chen and Chu had been delivered was ambiguous, saying that he did not know the details, but he firmly denied that he had received the execution order. Therefore, it is expected that the lives of traitors Chen and Chu still have a few days to be spared.</p>

<h3>A Tragedy in Qilin Township, Wujin: Village Head Murders Four Children with His Own Hands, Suffers Severe Trauma and Develops Mental Illness</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changzhou, 2nd] Huang Zhongxiu, a villager from Mao Sanfangtou Village near Qujia Lane, No. 2 Bao, Qilin Township, Sixth District of Wujin, is over forty years old and serves as the village head of this Bao. He is cautious and taciturn. He has three sons and two daughters. In November of last year, because villager Huang Songquan plotted to become the director of the Shuixian Police Bureau, he urgently needed funds and was forced to borrow twenty dan of rice from Huang Shengzu's wife, a member of his clan, on behalf of Songquan. The price per dan was only a few yuan. This year, when Songquan repaid the loan, Shengzu's wife insisted on returning the original rice, otherwise each dan would have to be priced at 20,000 yuan. Zhongxiu had to compensate more than 300,000 yuan. He had no choice but to sell an acre of land and use the money to pay off the debt. As a result, he was filled with anger and worried about the loss of livelihood, and suffered excessive trauma, and developed mental illness. At around 6:00 AM on the 31st of last month, taking advantage of his wife's absence to wash rice on the riverbank, his three sons and one daughter were still asleep (the eldest daughter, 26 years old, did not stay at home that day). He suddenly had murderous intent, first locked the door, turned around and held a sharp blade, and continuously slashed at the fourteen-year-old eldest son, the twelve-year-old second son, the ten-year-old youngest son, and the four-year-old youngest daughter. For a time, heads were split open, necks were severed, legs were broken, and intestines were flowing, and blood and flesh covered the bed. After the second son was severely wounded, he was still able to quickly get up to the door and pull the door open to escape, but it was too late. His head was split into two pieces, his brains burst out and he fell to the ground. A family of four died, a tragic scene. When the wife of the murderer, Huang Zhang, returned home and saw this, she was shocked, unable to cry. She reported to the neighborhood chief and others, who escorted the murderer Huang Zhongxiu to the Sixth District Office in the town. The district chief, Li Youwei, interrogated him, and Huang Zhongxiu directly admitted to hacking and killing three of his own sons and one daughter. When asked why he did such a tragic thing, he said, "I suffer because I am honest. At the time, I thought that if my children grew up in the future, they would be as honest as me, and they would definitely suffer in this evil world, so I quickly killed them all." The district chief, according to the confession, prepared a document and presented the murderer to the county government for review. After the incident occurred, according to informed sources in the township, Huang Zhongxiu's murder of four children is worthy of pity. They believed that in this case, they should request to waive the inspection of the bodies of the victims and should not fail to report the case. Also, Huang Zhongxiu usually acted honestly and sincerely. When the members of the district self-defense team arrested him, they all lamented the misfortune of this mentally ill patient. Hundreds of villagers even pleaded for him to be released, and Huang Zhang also volunteered to follow her husband into prison to prevent him from committing suicide.</p>

By November, Qinbao could not stand the harassment and sneaked back to her mother's home. On April 23rd of this year, she went to her aunt's home in Huangqie, and was again forced by Chen Shenghong to live with him along with the Fengge Township Self-Defense Corps. Although the township chief mediated, it was ineffective. On the 29th of the previous month, her father and daughter went to the Qingyang District Office to sue, but District Chief Xu Zukun was unable to deal with it. Unexpectedly, when the father and daughter returned to Ning Shao, Chen Shenghong had already gathered local thugs and beat Jin Gui down and snatched Qinbao away. Fortunately, the Dan Tong Self-Defense Team chased and captured them at the ferry and escorted them to the police station. Chen Shenghong and his accomplices Hu Xiyuan, Li Zuhong, Fan Ajiu, etc. were transferred to the judiciary for trial on the 31st.</p>

<p>Rice Prices Soar and Life Is Difficult: Hefei rice prices once rose to 30,000 yuan per stone last month. Later, because the second wheat was growing vigorously and a bumper harvest was imminent, people had something to replace food, and the price fell back to 23,400 yuan. Unexpectedly, in the past week, rice prices in the ports along the river were too high, and merchants rushed to buy and transport goods out of the country. Hundreds of stones were transported north to Bengbu and south to Wuhu and Nanjing every day, and rice prices gradually rose again. The price per stone reached 43,000 yuan on the 27th. Other items also became expensive, and it is hoped that the authorities will quickly ban the export of rice and stabilize market prices.</p>

<p>Escort Team Police Rescue Fishing Boats: According to a letter from the Yuhuan Fishing Association, the Escort Brigade of the Offshore Water Police Bureau stationed in Songmen, this county, recently reported that bandit Chen Zhaoyun and his accomplices had seized seven fishermen, including Wang Gencai, and seven or eight fishing boats from Kanmen in Pishan waters. Police officers were dispatched to rescue them. The Jiang Brigade Commander sent a team to suppress them, but they unexpectedly met on the way and a fire broke out. As a result, the bandits' situation was unfavorable and they took the opportunity to escape. Three seized fishing boats and five fishermen were rescued from danger. The remaining four or five fishing boats and two or three fishermen are still in the hands of the bandits.</p>

<h3>The Mission of the Ministry of National Defense</h3>
<p>The Ministry of National Defense was established on June 1st, with Minister Bai Chongxi and Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng already assuming their duties. Simultaneously, former Chief of General Staff and Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army, General He Yingqin, sent a nationwide telegram to all military officers, expressing unanimous support for this new system. This marks a new chapter in the modern military history of China. This reform can be seen not only as a major military reform since the founding of the Whampoa Military Academy but also as an important advancement in China's political system and military organization. What the entire nation of China hopes for today is the nationalization of the military and the democratization of politics. In other words, to implement military consolidation to achieve the unification of military administration and command, to separate the military from the party and the military from the people, and to lay the foundation for the implementation of democratic politics. The government's abolishment of the Military Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Military Affairs this time, and replacing them with the Ministry of National Defense, not only transforms the wartime military organization into a peacetime organization but also establishes a relationship of subordination between the military and administrative organizations, which has a significant impetus for the nationalization of the military and the democratization of politics. As Chief of General Staff Chen said, "The establishment of the Ministry of National Defense this time is an epoch-making reorganization in China's military organization, adopting the military system of democratic countries and subordinating the military to politics." Therefore, the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense has great significance both militarily and politically.</p>
<p>In terms of China's military-political system, not to mention the arrogance of the warlords of the Northern Warlord era, even from the time of the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army until now, for the past twenty years, the central military organization has been directly under the National Government. This may have been due to the military needs of the revolutionary period and the war against foreign aggression. Although there was also a Ministry of Military Affairs under the Executive Yuan in the past, it was purely a military administrative organization. Moreover, due to the confusion between military administration and command, its powers were even more limited. The Ministry of Military Affairs also had to be under the command of the Military Affairs Commission. Therefore, before the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense, China's military administration was almost unrelated to the administration. This system is ultimately a wartime system, and now that the war of resistance has ended, there is a need to change course. Generally, people believe that the following four aspects of China's current military issues urgently need reform: (1) The military belongs to the state, ensuring the unification of military administration and command. (2) Military establishment, implementing the separation of the military from the party and the military from the people, improving military education, enriching equipment, and improving the personnel management system to build a modern national army. (3) Improving the conscription system. (4) All national troops (including the National Army and the Communist Army) should be reorganized in accordance with the disarmament plan. However, the prerequisite for solving these problems is to establish a sound and rational military organization. The accelerated establishment of the Ministry of National Defense this time has its important significance here.</p>
<p>As for the tasks that the Ministry of National Defense should undertake in the future, it goes without saying that everyone knows that they must be extremely important. In today's situation in China, if a modern army cannot be established in the future, it will be impossible to maintain the survival of the nation-state, let alone take on the responsibility of maintaining peace and security in the Far East and even the world. We believe that the Ministry of National Defense should at least strive to accomplish the following things:</p>
<p>First, it is necessary to truly achieve the nationalization of the military, which is a prerequisite for establishing a modern national army. Looking around the world's major powers, although there are factional divisions in politics, there is absolutely no difference in the military. The command authority belongs entirely to the state, and there is no such thing as a "private army." Moreover, personnel changes in politics may be more frequent, while personnel and organizational changes in the military are rare. In the relationship between the military and politics of major powers, not only must the military obey politics, but the military is also above the vortex of political struggles and is rarely affected by political changes. The reason is very simple, because the military is originally the only tool to guarantee the independent survival of the nation-state. In today's complex international relations, crises are everywhere, and there is a possibility of war at any time. If any country does not have the power of self-defense, it is not enough to survive in this world. The so-called "survival of the fittest" is even more obvious in today's atomic age. If the nationalization of China's military cannot be achieved in the future, a modern national army cannot be established. Therefore, whether the military can be nationalized is the key to China's survival. After the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense, the first thing to do is how to nationalize the national army. No one can deny that the current political stalemate in the country and the resurgence of the war in the Northeast are due to the fact that the military has not yet been nationalized. If we want to ask about the specific methods of nationalizing the military, then we can answer that it has already been agreed upon in the Political Consultative Conference. As long as we sincerely implement the Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction, as long as the government and the Chinese Communist Party simultaneously implement it in earnest, it will not be difficult to fulfill the mission of the Ministry of National Defense.</p>
<p>Second, we must concentrate all our efforts on building national defense. In the past, China's doors were wide open, with almost no national defense to speak of. Once the Japanese invaders launched a war of aggression, they drove straight into the interior of China, almost unstoppable. How can we ignore such a severe historical lesson! Judging from China's current international environment, we should "mend the fold after a sheep is lost," and we must not harbor any僥幸 mentality. Furthermore, major powers are concentrating on national defense construction, and China needs to catch up urgently. For example, the Soviet Union, after the war, its international position was already secure, but the Soviet authorities still haggle over the expansion of the "security zone" to serve as a buffer zone in case of another war. In the United States, the secret of the atomic bomb is kept secret and absolutely not made public, and it has built naval and air bases all over the world, still not enough, and it also wants to maintain the wartime standard of its domestic army, navy, and air force. All of this is for the security of the country, all for the national defense of the country. Of course, we have heard Bernath's call to reduce the military and Einstein's proposal to establish a world government, but we must know that a country without a national defense foundation is not qualified to talk about these high-sounding theories. Therefore, the Ministry of National Defense must concentrate all its efforts on building national defense, and the Chinese people must also follow the example of Soviet national construction, tighten their belts, and support the government in building national defense.</p>
<p>Third, to build a new army, we must implement military consolidation, and to implement military consolidation, we must adopt the principle of elite troops. Emphasis on quality over quantity. The Chinese army, in terms of quantity, is unmatched by any country in the world, but in terms of quality, it lags far behind! During the War of Resistance, in order to launch a comprehensive defense, it was necessary to have such a large unit, but today, having a large army is of no benefit to national defense. The financial burden of providing for them is heavy, and it is enough to strangle the economy and hinder the country's construction and progress. Therefore, we advocate the principle of elite troops. However, we must not forget that the officers and soldiers who are laid off have fought to the death for the country during the War of Resistance and have made great contributions to protecting the country and defending the people. We must properly arrange for them so that they can all get what they need in terms of life, education, and spirit.</p>
<p>In short, the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense is a major reform in the system, but the most important thing is "it depends on people." At the time of the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense, we greatly admire the graceful demeanor of former Chief of General Staff He, which sets an example for meritorious generals, and hope that the newly appointed Minister Bai and Chief of General Staff Chen will bury themselves in hard work and make further efforts for China's military construction. A strong China is the cornerstone of world peace, and the Ministry of National Defense has a great responsibility to make China strong.</p>

<h3>Western Countries Problem Investigation Committee Proposes the United Nations Should Sever Diplomatic Relations with Spain; Franco is a Potential Threat to Peace</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] London, 2nd - Broadcast: Today, all morning newspapers in Madrid prominently published the recommendations of the Security Council's sub-committee investigating Franco's Spain, advocating that the United Nations sever diplomatic relations with Spain unless the Franco regime falls. The leader of the Franco regime's propaganda work, contrary to past practice, believes that such attacks are beneficial to maintaining the Franco regime and therefore publishes them.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 1st] The United Nations' Spanish Problem Investigation Committee today expressed moral condemnation of the Franco government and recommended that the Security Council refer the Spanish problem to the United Nations' highest body, the General Assembly, for handling. The committee declared the Franco regime a "possible threat to international peace" and proposed that the world universally sever diplomatic relations with Spain unless the Franco government is replaced by September of this year. The report recommends that the Security Council submit this matter to the 51-nation General Assembly to be held in New York on September 3rd. Ask the General Assembly to demand that all member states sever diplomatic relations with Spain unless the Franco regime "retires". Although the Franco regime does not currently threaten peace, its actions are sufficient to cause a threat. In addition, the report recommends that the Security Council endorse the joint anti-Franco declaration made by the United Kingdom, France, and the United States in March, which calls on the Spanish people to overthrow Franco by peaceful means and establish an interim government until free elections are held. All five members of the committee, except Poland and Brazil, which adopted a reserved attitude, unanimously endorsed this report. Poland, the original proposer of the case, adopted a reserved attitude towards the report, and the Brazilian representative also adopted a reserved attitude. It is recommended that the case be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly, and that the General Assembly call on all member states to sever diplomatic relations with Franco. The investigation report proposes that after the Franco regime is overthrown, and after other free conditions, such as the release of political prisoners, the recall of exiled Spaniards, freedom of political assembly, and free and open elections, are satisfactorily fulfilled, the United Nations should invite Spain to join as a member state.</p>
<p>The Investigation Committee found the following facts: (1) The Franco regime is a "fascist regime"; (2) During the war, Franco provided substantial assistance to the enemy countries; (3) Franco colluded with Hitler and Mussolini to launch a war against the United Nations; (4) Since the end of the war, Franco has refused to cooperate in eliminating the remnants of European fascism and Nazism in several incidents; (5) The Franco regime continues to persecute political enemies; (6) The number of armed personnel is far greater than expected by any peace-loving and non-aggressive country.</p>
<p>The report does not mention the allegation by Poland and the Spanish government in exile that the Franco government is engaged in atomic research with the assistance of German scientists.</p>
<p>The report has been distributed to the eleven member states of the Security Council and will be submitted for discussion at the next meeting, which is scheduled for around the 5th of this month.</p>
<h3>Monarchy or Republic? The Italian People Vote Enthusiastically; The Results Will Not Be Revealed Within This Week; Conflicts Occur Between Two Parties in Milan</h3>
<p>"United Press, Rome, 2nd" - The Italian people flocked to the polling stations this morning and voted enthusiastically to choose between monarchy and republic and to elect a constituent assembly. According to a statement by the Ministry of the Interior, the results of the vote will not be revealed until after the 7th of this month. The number of women participating in this vote is unprecedented. Some people witnessed Prime Minister Gasperi, leader of the Christian Democratic Party, voting in the capital, but it is not known whether King Umberto II voted. Police patrolled the city of Rome in electric trams and trucks, but there were no accidents. However, it was reported that in Milan, a bomb exploded in the offices of the Communist and Socialist newspapers at 2 a.m. today, injuring three workers and causing a fire.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 1st] On the eve of the Italian referendum to decide whether to abolish the monarchy, clashes have already occurred between the monarchist and republican parties in Milan today. When King Umberto II of Italy appeared at the entrance of the Milan Auditorium, the demonstrators outside had broken through the police defense line, and he had to return by a side road. In addition to deciding on the monarchy and republic, voters in Italy will also elect representatives to the constituent assembly to draft the new Italian political, social, and economic principles. This is the first free election since Mussolini implemented his dictatorship. There are more female voters than male voters. About 13 million men have the right to vote, and about 15 million women.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Rome, 1st] If the Republican Party has a majority in the Italian referendum, the Italian royal family will leave the country. According to the decision made at the meeting between Prime Minister Gasperi and Lieutenant General Leish, the Executive Member of the Allied Control Commission, the royal family will leave the country through the port of Genoa.</p>
<h3>The Population Birth Rate is Too Fast; The Earth Can No Longer Hold Us; The World Now Has a Population of 2 Billion</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 1st] The US Population Census Bureau announced today that the world's current population is 2 billion. If the current birth and death rates are used, it will increase to 20 billion within 300 years, and 45 more Earths will be needed to accommodate it. The countries with the highest population birth rates in the world are China and India. Although a quarter of the population born in India between 1930 and 1940 died at around two years old, it still increased by 50 million people in ten years. If the country's mortality rate is reduced to the US level, Indians can reproduce to at least five Earths of the current size within 100 years, and so can China.</p>
<h3>French Election Forecast: The Right Wing Has a Chance to Rebuild Its Strength</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 1st] France is scheduled to hold general elections tomorrow. Political observers here are struggling to predict which of the two major parties, the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, will have the upper hand. It is generally believed that the Radical Socialist Party, which was in a leading position before the war, lost ground in the general election on October 21st last year and has a chance to rebuild its strength this time. The number of votes obtained by the extreme right wing will increase, and the number of votes obtained by the right-wing People's Republican Party will decrease. According to the results of a recent poll, the Communist Party is in the lead and can obtain 26% of the votes, and the Socialist Party is second with 23%. According to the results of a survey by the Survey and Statistics Office, the Communist and Socialist parties can obtain 25% of the votes. The People's Republican Movement Party can obtain 18%. The Communist and Socialist parties each occupy 140 or 150 seats in the 582-member House of Representatives. On the other hand, the right wing will have a great chance to rebuild its strength. The Radical Socialist Party can obtain 11% to 12% of the votes, compared to only 6% before. It can obtain about 70 seats in the House of Representatives afterward. The other right-wing parties, under the banner of the Republican Liberty Party, can obtain 15% to 20% of the votes and 80 to 100 seats in the House of Representatives.</p>
<h3>Azores Islands; The United Kingdom and the United States Return Them to Portugal</h3>

<h3>The United Nations Refugee Committee Recommends the Establishment of an International Organization to Save European and Asian Refugees; Many Opinions Are Mentioned in the Report</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 1st] The United Nations Refugee Committee today formally recommended the establishment of an international organization to help the three million homeless people in Europe and Asia. However, there are many disagreements in the committee's report, which may need to be fully discussed by the Economic and Social Council. The report begins by stating that latent political factors prevent this issue from being resolved unanimously. For example, whether refugees who disregard other countries for political reasons can receive international assistance is one point of disagreement. Fourteen members of the committee insisted that such people should be assisted, while the six Eastern countries led by the Soviet Union did not comment.</p>
<h3>The International Court Will Try Japanese War Criminals Today; It Will Summon Allied Dignitaries to Testify; The Names of the Witnesses Have Not Been Released</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 2nd] A reliable source told the United Press today: When former Prime Minister Tojo and other important war criminals are tried, famous officers in the US Army and Navy and prominent figures in the Allied diplomatic and political circles will be summoned to testify. Authorities here refused to release the names of these witnesses, but said that when the trial opens on June 3rd, the defense lawyers will take "bold" steps, and anyone the defense team deems necessary to testify will be summoned to testify. The authority continued to say that only President Truman and MacArthur were listed as the two people who "cannot be summoned to testify for the defendant." Before the prosecution makes a public statement or any evidence is received, the International Military Tribunal for the Far East will first deal with several motions submitted by both the prosecution and the defense.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 2nd] It was announced today that Professor Blanc of Catholic University Law School has been hired as the international legal advisor to Prosecutor Keenan of the Tokyo International Tribunal.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Since the Dutch professor Grotius first proposed the concept of international law to be observed by countries in 1628, Napoleon's exile on Saint Helena Island in 1815 was almost the first time a war criminal was punished. Although the Allied powers discussed the issue of German Emperor William II and more than 900 other war criminals in 1919, the concept of international trials of war criminals had not yet matured. Last November, the Nuremberg trial of Nazi war criminals was almost the first international trial in history. The Tokyo International Military Tribunal's trial, like Nuremberg, is the manifestation of mankind's highest wisdom seeking to prevent war from recurring.</p>

<p>[French News Agency, Rome, 1st] The government announced that after Italy and the United Kingdom and the United States reach a supplementary agreement, a new armistice agreement will be signed with the Allied powers. The so-called supplementary agreement is based on Article 5 of the original armistice agreement, which was drafted for the military needs of the Allied powers in Italy.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 1st] An authoritative source in diplomatic circles here revealed that a new plan that will make Germany a "political federation" is expected to be submitted to the meeting of the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France in Paris on June 15 for discussion.

The three are currently still detained, and no information about them is available. It is reported that the Romanian government arrested these three, as well as several members of the Liberal and National Peasant Parties, accusing them of anti-government conspiracies.

(2) To propose recommendations and take other appropriate actions to achieve higher standards in human rights in the United States, thereby ending the oppression of American blacks.

<h3>France Asks Britain and the U.S. to Intervene: Urges Siam to Return Territory, British Envoy Keen is Seeking a Compromise</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 1st Dispatch] Officials recently announced that, regarding Franco-Siamese relations, the French Foreign Ministry has approached the British and American ambassadors, alerting both governments. It is alleged that after border disputes arose between France and Siam, the Siamese government exaggerated the situation to divert attention, so that France's demand for Siam to return the territories seized from Vietnam in 1941 with the help of Japanese pressure would become a secondary issue. Therefore, the French government had no choice but to alert the British and American governments, thereby urging the Siamese government to cease its assistance and protection of Laotian rebels, and to return the territories seized from Laos and Cambodia to Vietnam. This is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd Dispatch] The Observer reported on Thursday that Sir Josiah Crosby, the British Special Commissioner for Southeast Asia, is informally seeking a compromise to the Siamese-Vietnamese border dispute. The disputed territory is part of Laos and Cambodia that Siam seized from France in 1941. The Siamese people have deep feelings for these territories, so they might as well be called the Alsace-Lorraine of Siam.</p>
<p>Disputed Territory Originally Belonged to Siam</p>
<p>In 1867, the Kingdom of Cambodia became a French protectorate, but the northern provinces of Battambang and Siem Reap remained within Siam. Subsequently, France exerted pressure, and in 1904, the province of Lan Chang was ceded to France. In 1907, Battambang and Siem Reap were also incorporated into French territory. These two provinces have fertile land, forming rice-producing plains, and Siem Reap also contains Siam's precious historical sites. In 1940, the Siamese military dictator, Phibul Songkhram, demanded that the Vichy government return these two provinces and other large tracts of land, leading to war. The following year, with Japanese mediation, Siam took Laos's Lan Chang province (150 miles long and 60 miles wide) and Cambodia's Battambang, Bassac provinces, and part of Siem Reap (approximately 200 miles long and 75 miles wide).</p>
<h3>New Parliament Opens: Cabinet Resigns as a Matter of Protocol</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Bangkok, 2nd Dispatch] The first session of Siam's new parliament began today, with King Ananda (20 years old) presiding in person. Siamese Prime Minister Pridi Banomyong's cabinet has resigned as a matter of protocol but will continue to work until parliament approves a new prime minister next week.</p>
<h3>Batavia Establishes War Crimes Investigation Committee: Hosted by the Chinese General Association</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 1st Dispatch] A War Crimes Investigation Committee has been established here, hosted by the Chinese General Association. Fourteen Chinese community leaders, known for their impartiality, have been appointed as members of the committee. The committee is chaired by Chiang Chia-tung. Hereafter, when relevant authorities require information regarding the activities of Chinese in the region during the Japanese occupation, they can consult this committee.</p>
<p>Dutch Refugees Evacuate Java</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st Dispatch] Dutch refugees in the Indonesian-controlled areas of central Java began evacuation last week by British aircraft. One thousand people have already been transported, and it is expected that another 1,500 will be transported this week, barring any obstacles.</p>
<h3>UN Human Rights Commission Resolves: To Establish a World Press Freedom Subcommittee, Chinese Delegate Xia Jinlin Submits Memorandum</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 1st Dispatch] The United Nations Human Rights Commission has unanimously resolved to establish a World Press Freedom Subcommittee to study implementation methods. This case has now been requested for approval by the Economic and Social Council. This case is based on a memorandum from the U.S. State Department. Human Rights Commission Chairman Eleanor Roosevelt said it has been decided to invite experts to assist. Chinese delegate Xia Jinlin also submitted a memorandum, advocating that a subcommittee should be formed by representatives from countries with different levels of development in the world's press to conduct research. Xia also said: Americans naturally only understand the world from the American perspective, but they do not know that the press in other parts of the world is not so developed. American newspapers have become an industry, with huge profits, while other countries are not. News agencies such as the Associated Press and United Press cannot be competed with by other countries. These two news agencies can rely on income to maintain themselves and do not need government subsidies. In China, newspapers are poor, and news agencies cannot survive by relying on them. This situation is not unique to China. Therefore, we must invite representatives from other countries to participate in the subcommittee so that we can draft realistic and feasible plans.</p>

<h3>Today is the June 3rd Opium Suppression Day: Opium Burned as Usual, Police Bureau Strictly Prohibits All Opium and Drug Use in the City by the End of the Month, Sales and Trafficking are Punishable by Death</h3>
<p>Today is the June 3rd Opium Suppression Day. At 9:00 AM, the Municipal Government's Memorial Week and the June 3rd Opium Suppression Day Memorial Meeting will be held simultaneously. Mayor Wu Guozhen will personally attend to report on matters related to opium suppression and to express his determination to eradicate opium and drugs in the city. At 11:00 AM, the Police Bureau will publicly burn opium paraphernalia and drugs on the Bund to raise public awareness. The Police Bureau has also set the end of June this year as the deadline for eradicating opium and drugs in the city. Any opium addicts who have not quit by the end of June will be severely punished upon discovery. "Sales," "trafficking," and "manufacturing" will be punishable by death.</p>
<p>The central government has long been determined to eliminate opium and drugs, and has repeatedly promulgated laws and regulations, clearly ordering its implementation. Shanghai, due to its past concession environment, had special circumstances, and the prohibition of opium was not thorough. Moreover, the enemy and puppets occupied the city for eight years and implemented policies of drug poisoning, so that Shanghai has almost become a haven for opium and drugs, which is deeply regrettable. After the Shanghai Police Bureau took over in September of last year, it immediately focused on this work. Director Xuan (Zhonghua) stated that opium suppression is crucial to the rise and fall of the nation, and he has paid special attention to it. He has formulated various plans and regulations for the city based on central government laws and regulations, and submitted them to the municipal government for approval and implementation. On the one hand, in accordance with the regulations, the period up to the end of March 1946 was designated as the period for opium addicts to register for reform, and all were to quit by the end of June. During the registration period, self-reform was promoted and encouraged through various means, and the registration books of opium addicts during the enemy and puppet period were collected. Each branch bureau was secretly ordered to earnestly implement the regulations.</p>
<p>More Than 500 Opium Offenders Detained</p>
<p>As of the end of March, a total of 6,060 opium addicts were registered, and 249 taels and 7 mace of opium, plus one package, four blocks, 5 catties and 12 taels and 4.5 mace of heroin, plus 244 packages, four blocks of opium paste, plus two and a half boxes, plus one tael and four mace, 745 opium bubbles, eight and a half cans of opium ash, plus five packages, plus half a box, plus ten taels and nine mace and six fen, seven packages of opium dregs, 397 opium pipes, 406 opium lamps, and miscellaneous opium paraphernalia, such as opium boxes, copper spoons, cleaners, etc., totaling 1,208 pieces were confiscated. Except for the opium, which was approved to be used for pharmaceutical purposes, and the pure heroin, which was handled separately, all the rest will be burned publicly in the Bund Park today on the June 3rd Opium Suppression Day, in order to raise public awareness. Since April 1, people who have been found transporting opium and drugs have either been sent for resettlement or to the court for trial. As of now, a total of 191 suspected offenders have been sent for resettlement, and 351 opium offenders have been sent to the court for trial (this number is up to the end of April. The statistics for May have not yet been fully reported by the various branch bureaus). The head of household's joint guarantee has been handled by the Civil Affairs Bureau issuing orders to the various district offices. They were originally limited to submit them to the various branch bureaus for submission to the archives for verification by April 15, but due to the busy election affairs, they have not yet been submitted in full. As for the opium and drug resettlement center, it has been established in accordance with the regulations within the Police Hospital, and a drug rehabilitation hospital has also been established, which has also been designated by the municipal government to be managed by the Shanghai Municipal Drug Rehabilitation Hospital. However, due to the limited number of hospital beds, the capacity is not large, which is not without difficulties.</p>
<p>Drug Rehabilitation Pills to be Sold This Month</p>
<p>Since receiving the Measures for Eradicating Opium and Drugs, the Health Bureau has organized an Opium and Drug Eradication Assistance Committee to promote the work. On the one hand, it ordered all public and private medical institutions to participate in assisting with drug rehabilitation. In addition, the testing work of the Shanghai Police Bureau's Opium and Drug Resettlement Center has recently been handled by the bureau, and the Municipal Drug Rehabilitation Hospital is specially responsible for receiving and rehabilitating opium offenders. Now, it has been ordered to jointly consult with the Civil Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau to formulate an implementation plan and schedule for eradicating opium and drugs, so that it can be implemented on schedule. The Municipal Drug Rehabilitation Hospital will also be expanded into a Municipal Drug Rehabilitation Demonstration Center, with 300 beds, to accommodate and rehabilitate opium addicts. Regarding the drugs needed to quit opium, they have now been manufactured in accordance with the Shanghai Municipal Government's approved Measures for Opium Addicts to Purchase Drug Rehabilitation Pills Voluntarily, and they have been handed over to the bureau's drug supply department's various supply points to be sold starting this month. The measures are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Measures for Opium Addicts to Purchase Drug Rehabilitation Pills Voluntarily</h3>
<p>(1) These measures are formulated in accordance with Articles 9 and 10 of the Executive Yuan's Measures for Eradicating Opium and Drugs in the Regions. (2) The drug rehabilitation pills shall be prepared and supplied by the Municipal Health Bureau in accordance with the prescription set by the National Health Administration. (3) All opium addicts in the city who voluntarily quit opium shall, after registering with the Police Bureau, purchase a registration certificate from the Municipal Health Bureau's Drug Supply Department with the registration certificate, and the registration certificate shall be stamped by the Municipal Health Bureau's Drug Supply Department. (4) The drug rehabilitation pills are divided into eight numbers. Opium addicts who quit opium on their own should judge the depth of their opium addiction and purchase and take them according to the number. (5) Opium addicts who purchase drug rehabilitation pills, if they still do not quit after taking them according to the method of taking them, may purchase them again once with the registration certificate and the drug dispensing slip from the previous purchase. (6) Poor opium addicts may, after being certified by the chief of the baojia and the Police Bureau, hold the certificate and request to purchase drug rehabilitation pills from the Municipal Health Bureau's Drug Supply Department, and may be given a reduction or exemption from fees at the discretion of the sales agency, which must register in detail. (7) Drug rehabilitation pills shall not be imitated or resold. Those who violate this shall be punished according to law. (8) These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3>Opium Den Cracked on Eve of Opium Suppression Day</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] At around 9:00 PM last night, the Changning Police Bureau, led by Director Su (surname) of the Sub-Bureau, together with Section Chief Liu (surname) and other police officers, cracked three opium dens at No. 15, No. 19, and No. 58 Zhuananbang Road West, Yidingpan Road. More than ten smokers were arrested on the spot, together with opium and opium paraphernalia, and taken to the bureau. After a preliminary trial, it was confirmed and they were sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for further investigation this morning.</p>
<h3>City's Prices Higher Than Overseas: Many Foreign Ships Return Empty, Six Warehouses Increase Storage Fees Repeatedly</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Since the victory, European and American shipping companies have resumed operations one after another, and a large number of ships have come one after another. Due to the lack of equipment at the city's wharves, it is not easy to unload goods, and they often have to be moored for several weeks, incurring huge expenses and losses. Especially since the city's prices are higher than those of other countries, exports have decreased as a result, and most foreign ships have returned empty. The Chinese customs strictly prohibits the import of luxury goods, so the cargo transport of foreign ships is also affected. Last Saturday, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. telegraphed the Philippines, instructing that if the two ships coming to Shanghai had luxury goods, they should not be transported to Shanghai, but should be unloaded in the Philippines or Hong Kong, so as to avoid being unable to be imported upon arrival in Shanghai. In addition, the repeated increase in storage fees in the city has caused great distress to merchants. According to the joint notice of six warehouses, including Butterfield &amp; Swire, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Blue Funnel Line, Lung Mow, Kung Ho Hsiang, and Shanghai Wharf Company: Starting from June 1, the storage fees will be increased by 100%, and then by another 50%. This clever method actually calculates to an increase of 200%. For example, the storage fee for cotton is 260 yuan per foot per month (each piece is about 12 feet), cement is 260 yuan per bag per month, and each barrel is 631 yuan. With such high storage fees, merchants cannot afford it, and the transportation of ships is also indirectly affected to a considerable extent.</p>
<p>Key to Unfavorable Export Sales</p>
<p>Regarding the fact that the cheap sale of foreign goods makes it difficult to expand exports, the reporter interviewed an authority in the export industry and inquired about the matter. According to reports, there are many reasons for the unfavorable export factors, and it cannot be solved by simply lengthening the exchange rate. However, the elasticity of the exchange rate is related to the entire national finance and national economy, and there is also international restraint, so it cannot be decided rashly. The current regulations of the Central Bank, "Measures for Lending Foreign Currency," are actually sound policies, and in the future, there will be rewards for export professionals, which can establish a prosperous foundation from then on. In short, the implementation of this measure will reduce interest, which is an element of cost. Other points, such as the increase in transportation tools and the strengthening of management, are also the common requirements of exporters. Too slow transportation cannot save time, which is related to cost. Furthermore, modern countries all encourage export professionals in order to earn foreign exchange. All countries generally exempt export tax revenue. Although the export tax that our country has strictly set is small, it would be more beneficial if we could take the same steps as other countries.</p>
<h3>Suppression of Opium and Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Yu Songyun</p>
<p>(I) Suppression of Opium and National Health. Today is the first Opium Suppression Day in Shanghai after its restoration, and it is of particularly great significance. In the past eight years, during the period of occupation, the cruelty of the enemy's implementation of the poisoning policy was truly frightening. Just look at the large number of people who are now smoking opium and using drugs, and the depth of the poisoning, and you can imagine it. May I ask why the enemy wanted to implement a poisoning policy against us? The reason is simple: they wanted to destroy our social economy, and more importantly, to ruin the health of our nation and shorten our lives. In those years, Mr. Lin Zexu said: If the opium poison is not eliminated, then in a few decades, not only will there be no money to be raised, but also no soldiers to be trained. These were words of foresight. The enemy used such a poisonous scheme to destroy us.</p>
<p>Now that the war has been won, we demand the permanent survival of the nation, and naturally we demand the health of the national physique. To demand the health of the national physique, opium and drugs must be banned as soon as possible. Therefore, opium suppression is the central task of the national health movement. There are certainly many methods for the national health movement, but none is more important than opium suppression work. Because the purpose of opium suppression work is to eliminate the things that threaten people's health, hoping that every opium addict can "escape from the sea of suffering" and embark on the road to health and happiness again. This kind of work can be said to be positive work, and it is work that is extremely in line with the principles of health care.</p>
<p>(II) Shanghai's Opium Suppression Work. Opium suppression work is divided into several types: prohibiting cultivation, prohibiting transportation, prohibiting manufacture, prohibiting sale, and prohibiting smoking. The competent authority in this city is the Police Bureau. The Health Bureau, from a health standpoint, assists in the two matters of investigation and detoxification. Regarding the investigation aspect, the Police Bureau has established an Opium and Drug Investigation Center in the Police Hospital, specifically responsible for the investigation of suspected opium smokers and drug users. Because the investigation equipment in the center is lacking, it is stipulated by the municipal government that all urine tests of opium addicts and drug users shall be handled by the Health Bureau. Regarding detoxification, there is currently one municipal detoxification hospital in this city, located on Hengbang Road in Zhabei. From its establishment on December 1, 1945, to April 30, 1946, a total of 264 people have been admitted to the hospital for detoxification, and 211 people have been successfully detoxified. Of these 264 people, 184 were male and 80 were female. The most common type of drug addiction was opium, with a total of 195 people. Heroin was the second most common, with a total of 60 people. There were four morphine injectors and five heroin injectors. In terms of age, the most common age group was 36 to 40 years old, followed by 41 to 45 years old. In terms of the number of years of drug use, the most common was 1 to 10 years, followed by 11 to 20 years. The most common reason for drug use was addiction through playing around, followed by drug use due to stomach problems, and then drug use due to pulmonary tuberculosis. In terms of the occupation of those undergoing detoxification, there were 187 merchants, 19 workers, 47 people who were unemployed at home, 3 people each from the education and agricultural sectors, and 1 person each from the journalism, political, and medical sectors. There are many opium addicts and drug users in Shanghai, and the number of people admitted to the detoxification hospital is only a very small fraction. Those who come here are all voluntarily seeking detoxification and are generally in better circumstances. There are many poor opium addicts and drug users who mostly smoke white powder or inject morphine. The Health Bureau has historically collected and buried exposed corpses, and many of them were morphine injectors and white powder smokers. There are also two things about the detoxification hospital that are worth telling everyone: The first is the mental training of opium addicts and drug users. In addition to fulfilling their responsibilities in technical aspects and helping patients achieve the goal of detoxification, general medical staff also provide various mental guidance to increase the determination of those undergoing detoxification and to make them feel happy and reduce mental depression. The second is that poor opium addicts and drug users can apply for the convenience of enjoying free hospitalization.</p>
<p>(III) My Few Hopes. Today, I would like to take the opportunity of the Opium Suppression Commemoration to offer a few words: (A) Article 2 of the "Measures for Eliminating Opium and Drugs in Recovered Areas" promulgated by the Executive Yuan in December 1945 stipulates: "The total time limit for detoxification in each province and city shall not exceed six months at the latest." The deadline for detoxification in this city is approaching. I hope that those who have not undergone detoxification will quickly undergo detoxification and not delay themselves. (B) Article 6 of the "Provisional Regulations on Punishing Opium Suppression and Drug Prohibition" stipulates: "Those who inject morphine or use drugs shall be sentenced to death. Those who smoke opium shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than one year and not more than five years. Those who are addicted shall also be ordered to be detoxified within a limited time. Those who relapse after detoxification shall be sentenced to death or life imprisonment." This is to tell everyone that smoking opium or other drugs will be subject to criminal punishment, and the punishment for relapse is terrible. Please seize the opportunity and quit as soon as possible. (C) We absolutely prohibit all kinds of inferior detoxification drugs that use exaggerated methods and make false propaganda. I hope that everyone will not be deceived and will report them at any time to help crack down on them. (D) Whether people become addicted through playing around or through illness, it is not difficult to transform a weak physique into a strong physique after detoxification, and it is absolutely possible, as long as everyone pays attention to implementing the following five things: First, have moderate exercise every day. Second, take a bath often. Third, eat at regular times and pay attention to the combination of nutrition. Fourth, go to bed early and get up early. Fifth, have a bowel movement once a day. If these few things can be done conscientiously, then physical and mental health will definitely improve greatly.</p>
<p>In short, smoking drugs is a shameful and terrible thing. Its harm not only harms oneself, but also harms one's children and grandchildren. It goes without saying that those who smoke drugs are physically weak, and their children and grandchildren will also develop serious physical weakness. Therefore, I hope that those who smoke drugs will stand firm, grit their teeth, and quit as soon as possible, in order to survive for themselves and also to win a breath for their children and grandchildren!</p>
<h3>Cardinal Tian Held a Grand Mass in Xuhui Yesterday and Will Go to Sheshan for Pilgrimage Tomorrow</h3>

After changing his clothes, he returned to the Xujiahui Seminary of the Society of Jesus to attend a luncheon hosted by Bishop Zhu Jiliang of Shanghai. More than one hundred people attended, including bishops, drivers, and members of the laity. Bishop Zhu of Shanghai first delivered a speech in Chinese, explaining the reasons why Cardinal Tian was chosen for this special honor. Then, Apostolic Delegate to China, Archbishop Cai Ning, delivered a speech in Latin, noting that the election of China's first Cardinal and the establishment of the ecclesial structure was a timely measure taken by the Catholic Church, representing the Pope's concern for the welfare of China. Finally, Cardinal Tian delivered a speech, stating that since the ecclesial structure in China has been established, it should cooperate sincerely, regardless of nationality or association, in the spirit of self-governance, self-sufficiency, self-propagation, and self-support, and should pay special attention to education, culture, and professional training. After the meal, Cardinal Tian inspected the Xujiahui Seminary. At four o'clock, he gave a blessing at the Cathedral. In the evening, Cardinal Tian attended a reception hosted by the Yiyou Society. Those in attendance included Bishop Zhang Weidu, Father Fang, the Cardinal's attendant, as well as Zhang Weiping, the director of the society, Father Fang Hao, Wu Jingxiong, Yuan Jiahan, Chen Shifu, Shen Danming, and more than twenty others.

<h3>Thorough Solution to the City's Housing Shortage Expected to Be Realized After the Production Conference</h3>
<p>The city's housing shortage is second only to the food shortage. Yesterday, this reporter visited Mayor Wu to inquire about strategies for dealing with the housing shortage. He said: Regarding the housing shortage, I also attach great importance to it. Chairman Chiang personally drafted in Nanjing the principle of limiting occupancy to two rooms for five or more people, and three rooms for six or more people, with a maximum of no more than four rooms, to alleviate the housing situation. I strongly agree with this principle. Hereafter, the allocation of houses by administrative Yuan agencies should follow this principle. As for thoroughly alleviating the housing shortage, it will be necessary to wait until after the production conference before it can be addressed. Before a thorough solution is realized, if anyone occupies empty houses and demands advance fees in gold bars, citizens can report them to the Social Bureau and the Municipal Government's Housing Rental Committee, and they will be severely punished and absolutely not tolerated.</p>
<h3>Inaugural Meeting of the Housing Cooperative Held</h3>
<p>The Office of the Special Commissioner for Cooperative Enterprises of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei of the Ministry of Social Affairs, in order to solve the housing shortage for public works employees in this city, advocated and initiated the organization of a housing cooperative. After active preparation, everything is ready. On May 31st, the inaugural meeting of the Shanghai First Housing Cooperative was held at No. 65 Daming Road. The articles of association were approved, and directors and supervisors were elected. All corporate members joining the cooperative will pay a share capital of 100,000 yuan, and individual members will pay a share capital of 10,000 yuan. From now until the 15th, it will be the period for collecting share capital. The cooperative's housing will be divided into two types: enemy property allocated and sold by the government, and American mobile homes. Members can choose either one and the housing will be allocated in order of joining the cooperative. After the housing is decided, members will pay 30% of the housing value first, and the remaining amount will be paid in installments. The cooperative's address is currently temporarily located at No. 65 Daming Road. If any agencies, organizations, or individuals in this city intend to join the cooperative in order to solve the housing shortage, they can directly write to the cooperative to request the articles of association and join.</p>

<h3>Russian Driver Drove Jeep While Drunk: Crashed into Police Post; Car Destroyed and Driver Died</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Russian driver Fu Kaomenxi, 35 years old, resident of No. 158 Hamilton Building, Fuzhou Road, was driving Jeep No. 15863 of the Shanghai National Automobile Transportation Company at 3:30 AM yesterday morning at high speed from the west end of Linsen Road. Because the car was traveling too fast and the driver had consumed excessive alcohol, he lost control when passing Maigao Baolu Road. The car body crashed straight into the iron post of the police booth in the center of the road with a loud crash. In addition to the wheels and car body being completely shattered, the Russian driver was thrown dozens of feet away, collapsing to the ground unconscious. He was then taken to the Nanyang Hospital for treatment by a car summoned by the police, but he died of his injuries. The body has now been transferred to the coroner's office for examination.</p>
<h3>Minister Gu Convened Business and Industry Representatives: Symposiums Held Separately in Two Locations; Continued Exchange of Opinions</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] At this critical juncture when Chinese industry is on the verge of bankruptcy, Minister Gu came to Shanghai from Nanjing specifically to convene responsible persons from various trade unions and employers and employees from both sides, to explain the government's policy decisions on handling labor disputes and to instruct business and industry circles on points that they themselves should pay attention to and improve. The reactions from various parties were mixed. Rather than lecturing, Mr. Gu wanted to hear the opinions of employers, employees and the industrial and business community in order to gather information and adopt their opinions. Yesterday afternoon and morning, he convened responsible persons from various trade unions and guilds separately at the Ningbo Township Association and the New Life Club to exchange opinions in a symposium format. During the session, both sides elaborated in detail on their own pain points and their hope for government assistance in making improvements. Mr. Gu stated that the government had great determination in supporting legitimate industry and commerce and implementing policies, and promised to relay their current difficulties and opinions to the central government for effective measures to be taken to save the current crisis.</p>
<p>[Also Reported] Mr. Gu finished his official business in Shanghai and returned to Nanjing by night train last night.</p>

<h3>Major Theft Case at the Bank of China: Mastermind's Mother and Younger Brother Arrested</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In the case of the major theft of 150 million yuan from the Central Bank, after the mastermind, Chen Yuancheng, an employee of the safekeeping section, took advantage of his position to embezzle and abscond, the Huangpu Police Precinct has been doing its best to investigate. In addition to recalling a portion of the original position and detaining and strictly interrogating Zhu Yunfei, the general manager of the Chongqing Bank Shanghai Branch, who attempted to alter accounts, the mastermind Chen Yuancheng has still not been arrested. Currently, the police precinct has received a telegram from the Zhenhai Commissioner's Office stating that the mother and younger brother of the suspect Chen have been arrested, but there is no information on Chen. This reporter specifically visited the person in charge of the Huangpu Precinct. The police precinct's reply telegram was also ambiguous. A detailed inquiry has been telegraphed again, and it is expected that a reply will be received within a few days. As for the previous reports that Chen had been arrested, they still need to be verified.</p>
<h3>Major Theft Case in Gaoqiao Town Solved Within 24 Hours</h3>
<p>A large batch of cloth worth more than 10 million yuan was stolen from Lu Xiangtai Cloth Shop on West Street, Gaoqiao Town, on the night of May 30.

Subsequently, Inspector Li Zhengming and plainclothes police chief Jiang Ji of the unit discovered within two hours that the stolen cloth was the work of Chen Genbao, a former apprentice of the shop who had stopped his apprenticeship two years ago. It was reported that the suspect had already taken the stolen goods and fled to Nanxiang. Subsequently, Inspector Li and plainclothes police chief Shi Wensheng were dispatched to arrest the person and recover the stolen goods together at the Zhangjia Ancestral Hall in the East Market of Nanxiang. The precinct then transferred the thief to the court for strict handling. The case, from its occurrence to its solving, did not exceed 24 hours.</p>
<h3>American Sailors Joking: Not Only Approaching Insult, but Also Endangering Lives</h3>
<p>At 3:00 PM yesterday, a ferry carrying twenty or thirty passengers, sailing from the Pudong Xidu area to the opposite bank, was passing by the American warship No. 585 near Yangshupu. Suddenly, passengers were hit by the warship's sailors using water hose spouts, seemingly as a joke, but they ignored the danger of the small wooden boat capsizing in the rough waves. Everyone on the boat was soaked and filled with anger. Fortunately, several policemen on the boat maintained order and said that they would report it to the American military police, and only then did it subside. According to the boatmen, similar incidents often occur in the Huangpu River. They deeply hope that those responsible for the American warship will strictly restrain their personnel.</p>
<h3>Rigorous Investigation of All Grain Loans: Jiangbei, Tongyi, Yangtze and Other Companies: Persons in Charge Summoned for Questioning</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Since the central government dispatched a high-ranking official to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the root cause of the recent surge in grain prices, all related parties have been cooperating in the investigation. Mayor Wu has also repeatedly stated his determination to suppress and stabilize grain prices in this city. Therefore, the progress of the investigation work has been swift and decisive in recent days. It is reported that those participating in the investigation work, in the case of the 16 rice shops that received grain loans, include the Military Statistics Bureau, the Jiangsu Commissioner's Office of Supervision, the Shanghai Audit Office of the Audit Department, the Ministry of Food, and the Gongxin Accounting Firm, which shows the general importance that the authorities attach to the grain loan issue. Those who dare to test the law will be punished severely. Currently, in addition to Wu Rongsheng of Santai Bank already being detained and Rong Yongming of Wuchang Rice Shop being detained again due to suspicion of price gouging, responsible persons of other companies that received grain loans, such as Jiangbei, Tongyi, and Yangtze, have also been summoned for questioning. It is reported that the entire grain loan incident is still under intensified investigation, and the truth should not be difficult to uncover.</p>
<p>Regarding the grain loan case, it was rumored yesterday that Wang Jizhi of Jiangbei Company and Lu Linxun of Tongyi Company had been detained. According to this reporter's investigation, Wang Xunzhi is not a member of Jiangbei Company. The rumors that personnel from Jiangbei and Tongyi Companies have been detained are both inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Joint Reserve of Silver and Banking Industries - Preparing for Reorganization</h3>
<p>The establishment of the Shanghai Banking Joint Reserve Committee dates back to the 21st year of the Republic of China [1932]. It was formed by banks providing verified assets as collateral to obtain public notes and treasury certificates issued by the committee for interbank lending and guarantee purposes. At that time, all major banks except the Central Bank participated as committee members, which had a considerable effect on regulating finance. However, it was announced that the committee would be dissolved in accordance with the government's regulations on clearing counterfeit currency. Now that the overall situation has been stabilized and various economic sectors are entering a new phase of construction, the banking industry in this city, following the principles set by the Ministry of Finance, is reorganizing the Joint Reserve Committee through the Banking and Money Industries Association to strengthen financial organization and assist in the development of industry and commerce. Although formal approval from the Ministry of Finance has not yet been received, it is rumored that the authorities have indicated possible approval.</p>
<h3>Anhua Commercial Bank - Ordered to Suspend Operations and Liquidate</h3>

The reason for the suspension is related to the fact that the bank was originally registered as Anhua Commercial Bank but is now simply referred to as Anhua Bank. The bank has now established a liquidation office and has begun to process receipts and payments. However, the Ministry of Finance's order to suspend operations and liquidate has not yet been directly delivered to Anhua Bank.</p>

<h3>Tragic Incident in Huaiyang, Henan - Police Officer Shoots and Kills Middle School Student - Police Chief Instigated Beforehand and Abetted the Escape Afterward</h3>
<p>[Report from our Kaifeng Office] Tian Zi'an, a police officer of the Huaiyang County Police Bureau, shot and killed Yang Qisan, a student of Chengyuan Middle School, on the evening of May 2nd without any reason. The act was inhumane. Now, students from various schools in the county have jointly organized the Yang Qisan Tragedy Support Association and sent telegrams to schools, newspapers, cultural organizations, agencies, and legal entities throughout the country, stating: Chengyuan Middle School, a private school in Huaiyang, Henan, has 15 classes in senior and junior high school with over 1,000 students. Due to insufficient dormitory space at the school, students reside in rented private residences under the guidance of the school. Yang Qisan, a student in the second year of senior high school, from Shenqiu County, resided at No. 8, Kexin Houjie in this city. He usually abided by school rules and focused on his studies.</p>
<p>Jumping Over the Wall to Enter the Compound</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, at 10 PM on the evening of May 2nd, Tian Zi'an, a police officer of the Huaiyang County Police Bureau, led two policemen, each holding a gun, jumped over the wall to enter the compound and stormed into the room of the Kong family, claiming to be acting on the orders of the police chief to conduct a household registration check. They turned over boxes and chests, creating a chaotic scene. After searching for two hours without finding anything, they discovered a bicycle in the student's room and attempted to seize it under the cover of darkness. The student stood up to reason with them, reminding the police that they were supposed to respect teachers and protect the people, and should not have greedy intentions. The police officer and policemen became enraged, tied up the student, and brutally beat him, leaving him covered in injuries. His screams echoed throughout the neighborhood. After the beating, they continued to search the room.</p>
<p>Shot in the Waist</p>
<p>Due to severe injuries and thirst, the student crawled in the courtyard in search of cool water. The police officer and policemen, assuming he was going out to report them, shot him in the waist with a handgun. The landlord and village chief carried him to the hospital, where he died immediately. Upon hearing the news, the school authorities rushed to the scene and requested Police Chief Yang Shijie to arrest the perpetrators. Unexpectedly, the police chief had already released Police Officer Tian Zi'an overnight and sent two policemen to take the blame. The Huaiyang District Court, the Huaiyang County Government, and Division Commander Zhu of the 16th Division of the garrison army sent personnel to examine the body. It was confirmed that the student, Yang Qisan, had first suffered severe injuries with broken ribs, and then a bullet penetrated his waist, causing his intestines to spill out, resulting in his death. During the court's interrogation, the two accused policemen confessed that after killing Yang Qisan, they reported to the police chief together with the police officer. The police chief asked the police officer to retrieve his pistol and two household registration books and ordered to flee through the West Gate of the city.</p>
<p>Abetting the Escape of the Perpetrator</p>
<p>It is found that Police Chief Yang Shijie actually instigated the police officer to lead policemen to commit violence in the dark and shoot and kill a student for no reason. Afterward, he also released the perpetrator, Tian Zi'an, to escape, showing blatant disregard for the law! After the tragedy occurred, students in various schools in Huaicheng, fathers calling their sons, brothers searching for their younger brothers, students fled to their hometowns, creating social terror and panic. The police chief, who treated human life like grass and ruined education, is extremely vicious. The students mourn the tragic death of Yang Qisan and vow to provide support to uphold justice. In addition to awaiting legal resolutions, they earnestly request leaders, officials, newspapers, schools to jointly advocate for the following: (1) Detain Police Chief Yang Shijie and set a deadline for the arrest of the fugitive perpetrator, Tian Zi'an; (2) Severely punish Police Chief Yang Shijie for instigating his subordinates to commit violence and abetting the escape of the perpetrator; (3) Request all newspapers to unanimously support the cause; (4) Request all school students to work together with one heart and one mind to achieve the goals.</p>

<h3>Wuhan University - Uncertain Resumption of Classes - Reinstatement Funds Not Effectively Utilized - Many Original Professors Have Accepted Positions at Other Schools</h3>
<p>[Report from our Hankou Office on the 2nd] The situation regarding the resumption of classes at Wuhan University is gradually deteriorating. The reason is that the reinstatement funds allocated by the Ministry of Education to the university cannot be effectively utilized. Each student is only issued 100,000 yuan for travel expenses, resulting in difficulties that cannot be overcome. A portion of the reinstatement funds is currently being privately stored in a bank by the university's Academic Dean Yang, which has aroused opposition from faculty and students. Furthermore, over 20 professors, including Zhu Guangqing, Chen Yuan, Yang Rencai, and Tao Xun, have lost hope in the future of Wuhan University's resumption and have mostly accepted positions at Peking University, Central University, Anhui University, and Sichuan University. Therefore, faculty and students have dispersed, and the resumption of classes is uncertain.</p>

<h3>A Record of the Elementary School Curriculum Standards Conference</h3>
<p>— He Yicong</p>
<p>During these three days—May 27th to 29th—over thirty elementary education experts and special envoys from the Ministry of Education sat around the snow-white conference table, which symbolizes the nation’s constructive efforts, and worked hard on this national-attention-focusing Elementary School Curriculum Standards Conference. As an auditor, I was lucky enough to participate in this grand occasion and felt an unparalleled joy!</p>
<p>The venue was located north of the grassland of the Youth Corps branch on Shaanxi South Road in Shanghai, in such a beautiful environment. Sitting beside the window-facing seat, I could see the large mirror hanging inside, which fully reflected the outside world, the green shade swaying, making people think of the cool flavor in the depths of the building. Only this great work deserves such a beautiful, quiet, and solemn environment.</p>
<p>Regarding the conference, both Mr. Xia and Mr. Cai have already made records. Here, I will provide some free reporting outside of the records.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the tranquility of the air in the venue was unmatched in any other conference. This truly lived up to its name as a conference of experts, unconsciously making one aware of the greatness of the future of Chinese education. The conference lasted for three and a half days, with two and a half days being held in groups. The most impressive figure in the venue was Director Gu Shusen, the chairman, with that humble, experienced, and seasoned air. All debates were resolved through his hands. On the morning of the second day of the conference, it was too early, and only he and I were in the venue. He smiled and said he was going to play ball. While I was watching him gallop on the court, I secretly praised him for being "vigorous in old age."</p>
<p>The discussions on the issues of each subject were very enthusiastic, such as Xu Renjian, Xue Tianhan, Shi Renfu, Liu Qimu, Wen Shuting, etc. In particular, Mr. Dong Renjian (Principal of Xinlu Normal School), with his bald head, spoke very forcefully. At the end, when the final summary discussion was held, he even started a couplet with Director Gu. The most gentle were Mr. Chen Heqin, Shen Baiying, and Chen Bocui, who were calm and collected and did not say a single excessive word. Unfortunately, there were some regrets. When everyone was discussing the most tense moment, an old gentleman began to snore loudly. Several gentlemen only knew how to smoke and refused to speak, which was somewhat suspect of occupying a position without doing anything. There were also interesting things. On the last day, Principal Dong even led his family music team to personally demonstrate the value of music, giving people a beautiful shot to wear. During the break, I asked Mr. Huang from the Ministry to write a ink bamboo painting. When he signed his name, he smiled and told me, "My name is Huang Ruozhou. A newspaper mistakenly wrote it as Huang Ruodan. The Shen Bao changed it to Wang Ruozhou. It's really a big joke."</p>
<p>In the few days of the conference, I felt that there were two major crises facing education. The first is the low level of education in the inland areas, and the second is the panic among teachers. The former was reported by Mr. Huang, who said that when he ran to that side, not to mention the content of the courses, even the names of the courses were scattered and disorganized. The latter is an even more practical phenomenon in Shanghai. If they can't fill their bellies, who would be happy to stick to this position? Both of these crises are very urgent, and there are certainly many aspects that need to be remedied, but I don't intend to bring them up here, because even if I bring them up, people can't do it, and it would be in vain.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to praise all of these gentlemen for having a spirit of humility and open-mindedness on various issues. The two opinions raised by the Weiyu Elementary School Textbook Research Association and Mr. Lin Eryi (see Shen Bao) were all discussed in detail by them. The fact cannot be denied. This conference is just such a conference, and the achievements in just a few days are very limited. The effectiveness of the resolutions still depends on the realization of many conditions. However, the current need for educational progress is so urgent, and people's hopes for the conference are so sincere. How will the Ministry of Education, which hosted this conference, accept the communication suggestions from educational people all over the country? How will it match various correct experiences and reasons? Collect the wisdom of teachers and benefit the public, so that our country's basic education can embark on the road of building a new homeland. May 30th</p>
<h3>The Difficulty of Popular Lung Disease Prescriptions Widely Circulated</h3>
<p>Since the Shen Bao published the prescription for lung disease sent by Zhang Xixian, the director of the Fengxiang County Police Bureau in Shaanxi Province, on May 19, it has been very popular with readers. It is estimated that a considerable number of people have taken the prescription, and there have been more than 50 letters from various parties asking about and discussing it. The letters were selected and sent to Mr. Chen Cunren, the consultant of this column and a traditional Chinese medicine doctor, for further study. He has kindly answered each question and disclosed the answers as follows: (Editor)</p>
<p>(1) Chen Yanling and twelve others asked: Is this prescription too expensive? Can sick readers combine purchases?</p>
<p>[Answer from Doctor Chen Cunren]: This prescription is two qian per medicine, and the current price of medicine in Shanghai is more than 4,300 yuan per dose. It is impossible to combine purchases. Now, I will modify the names of the medicines: donkey-hide gelatin should be changed to donkey-hide gelatin beads, and Sichuan fritillary bulb should be changed to Zhebeimu fritillary bulb. The price of the medicine can be reduced to 2,600 yuan, but the effect is the same. If you want it to be cheaper, you can buy half a catty of each medicine from a "pharmacy" and distribute it into forty doses by yourself. The number of doses per combination is extremely cheap, but this is not possible for those who are not familiar with the situation in pharmacies.</p>
<p>(2) Wu Hao, Xiang Zhiqiang and eight others asked: Does this prescription have the effect of preventing lung disease?</p>
<p>[Answer from Doctor Chen Cunren]: This prescription has no preventive ability. Taking this prescription will only have the effect of providing nutrition for those with weak lungs who do not have tuberculosis.</p>
<p>(3) Doctor Chen Bomin and Wang Yeqin, Guo Liangang, Zhou Senzhi, Xu Zhiqian, and Chen Sisong asked: Are there any errors in the medicinal ingredients of this prescription, such as Angelica dahurica, Asparagus cochinchinensis, safflower, and donkey-hide gelatin? Is there any room for negotiation on the amount of medicine?</p>
<p>[Answer from Doctor Chen Cunren]: The taste of Angelica dahurica and Asparagus cochinchinensis is indeed the original prescription, and there are no errors. However, the use of Angelica dahurica does require consideration; there is also room for discussion on the amount of safflower. For the sake of rationality, I think there are several points that should be changed in this prescription: Angelica dahurica must be changed to steamed Stemona japonica to increase the bactericidal effect; the amount of safflower licorice should be lighter; the amount of Rehmannia glutinosa and Morus alba should be heavier; donkey-hide gelatin should be changed to donkey-hide gelatin beads. Three eggs are too many and too stuffy, digestion is quite a problem, long-term consumption is annoying, and eggs have no significant relationship in the combination, but in order to increase nutrition, it is possible to cook and eat them separately, one is also possible, two are enough. Now I will modify this prescription reasonably as follows:</p>
<p>Morus alba, Asparagus cochinchinensis, and Rehmannia glutinosa three qian each, cooked Rehmannia glutinosa, donkey-hide gelatin beads, apricot kernels, Zhebeimu fritillary bulb, white peony root, Anemarrhena asphodeloides, steamed Stemona japonica two qian each, safflower, licorice five fen each (eat two eggs separately every day)</p>
<p>Such a modification not only has a higher effect, but also reduces the price of medicine to more than 1,700 yuan per dose.</p>

<h3>An Article of Sincerity</h3>
<p>— Shao Xunmei</p>
<p>I haven't written anything for the past few years, my brain is practically rusted, and the pen feels like it weighs thousands of pounds. I really lack the courage to even pick it up, and even if I did, I wouldn't have the strength to move it.</p>
<p>Writing should never be forced. Articles that are forced out are like apples that haven't grown enough or turned red, always carrying a touch of greenness and a hint of sourness.</p>
<p>But there are articles that are forced out. People think highly of you and want you to express some opinions, and you can't really remain silent. In such circumstances, I often say, say whatever you have to say; say a few more words if you have a lot to say, and a few less if you don't. But there's one condition: the words must be true. Anything that is genuine, whether it's a single word, a flower, or a piece of paper, has a kind of beauty, a kind of moving power.</p>
<p>Many literary critics have diligently researched the characteristics of great works throughout history. The result of their research is that the greatness of a work lies in nothing but sincerity: only sincerity can be eternal and universal.</p>
<p>The kind of article we demand is an article of sincerity.</p>
<p>Aldous Huxley once said in an essay called "The Vulgarity in Literature": "It is vulgar to express in writing emotions that you do not truly have, but feel you should have because all noble people have them."</p>
<p>Therefore, to cater to fashion and utter insincere words, or to deliberately criticize and curse others in order to conceal one's own weaknesses, only to expose the very sins one possesses: such behavior is indeed vulgar to the extreme.</p>
<p>In the recent publishing world, this phenomenon is almost universal, the reason of course is still speculation and expediency, which can also be said to be the worship of "exhibitionism" and "inferiority complex." Eight years of war against Japan, living in tension every day, psychological change is also a fact that is not easy to completely avoid.</p>
<p>Post-war society was originally going to go through a considerable period of chaos. Many examples remain from the countries of Europe and America after the First World War, so we can take it as read that we shouldn't be surprised if we see things or articles that don't please the eye. But the hearts of the general public have already become false and deceitful, and in order to save people's hearts, we should do our best to promote articles of sincerity.</p>
<p>A great European revolutionary once said: "A country that has gone through a great upheaval is like a dirty pond that has been stirred up, and all the dirty things at the bottom of the pond float to the surface." The only way to deal with it is to wait patiently, and one day it will be clean. But we must be vigilant at all times, and constantly tell people not to mistake the dirty things floating on the surface for outstanding talents.</p>
<h3>On Viewing Paintings</h3>
<p>— Wen Tong</p>
<p>It is easy to come into contact with painting in our daily life, especially in Shanghai, where painting exhibitions can be seen almost all the time, so how should we view painting as an art?</p>
<p>Painting is a two-dimensional art. In other words, when we look at it, we only need to pay attention to the painting as a single image. Around us, there are many kinds of paintings, such as Chinese paintings, oil paintings, comics, advertising paintings... all are paintings. Are all these paintings looked at in the same way, or how should a certain kind of painting be viewed? We should solve these kinds of problems first.</p>
<p>Although there are many kinds of painting, we can divide them into two categories: one is pure painting, which is specifically for everyone to see; the other is practical painting, which is for publicity or advertising. Although the former may also be used for publicity, the artistic component is still the main condition; the latter is not completely without artistic elements, but the main goals are explanation, recording, and instruction.</p>
<p>Here, I only want to explain the way of viewing the former type of so-called pure painting, that is, the way of viewing Chinese paintings, Western paintings, and popular paintings (woodcuts, comics).</p>
<p>First, let's explain the way of viewing Chinese paintings: Chinese paintings can generally be divided into three categories: figure paintings, landscape paintings, and flower-and-bird paintings. The main materials used to create these paintings are brushes, rice paper or silk, ink pigments, and calligraphy, which occupies the most important position in Chinese paintings.</p>
<p>When we see a Chinese painting, the first thing to grasp is the composition, and we must pay attention to the position of the host and the guests. Jing Hao said: "Brushwork and composition are even more important on the spot." Li Cheng said: "First establish the position of the host and the guests, determine the shape of the near and far, and then insert the scenery and arrange the height and low."</p>
<p>Secondly, we need to pay attention to the brush and ink. Chinese painting pays attention to the use of brush and ink. The brush is the composition of lines, and the ink is the transmission of color. Its thickness, lightness, emphasis, and suppression should all meet the requirements. Wang Luhu said: "The use of brush and ink are mutually complementary." Gu Ningyuan said: "The people of the Yuan Dynasty used the brush with vitality, the intention with simplicity, there is profound meaning in it." He also said: "Vitality means no superficiality, hence what scholars call the scholar's brush; simplicity means no artificiality, hence what refined people call refined and profound meaning." Wang Shigu said: "The use of brush has thick and thin, strong and light, if it is uniform, it will be bare." As for the use of ink, Zhang Geng said: "Whether the ink is thick, light, dry, or wet, it should not have the slightest hint of secularity, this is the ultimate." Shen Zongqian said: "If the ink on silk is a uniform piece, it is dead ink; if the shades are distinct, it is living ink. Dead ink has no color, living ink has light, and it must be carefully distinguished." These words can be used to help understand the brush and ink of Chinese paintings.</p>
<p>The likeness of form in Chinese paintings does not occupy an important position, so Zhang Yanyuan said: "Ancient paintings, either abandoned their likeness of form and valued their bone structure, seeking their painting outside the likeness of form, which is difficult to explain to vulgar people."</p>
<p>The highest principle of Chinese painting is "spirit resonance and life movement," but this is an abstract concept. Instead of groping for it in an abstract concept, it is better for the viewer to experience it from its basic characteristics. The first characteristic is lightness and simplicity. Rao Ziran said: "The arrangement must be open at the top and bottom, and the four sides must be unobstructed, so that it can be full and rich. If it is filled to the brim, it will not be elegant." The second is tranquility, which is the realm of selflessness. Wang Shigu said: "When painting reaches the realm of wonder, it must have a sense of tranquility." He also said: "When painting reaches tranquility, it has reached the peak of perfection." The third is openness and ease, that is, "unintentional" or "impromptu," which must be sought in unlimited time. Zhang Geng said: "Spirit resonance can arise from ink, from brush, from intention, or from unintentionality, and that which arises from unintentionality is superior." The fourth is classical elegance. Shen Zongqian said: "If you want to open up a new realm outside the rules of the ancients, there are few who do not fall into the demonic path." If you can understand these four characteristics, it will not be difficult to view Chinese paintings.</p>
<p>The inscriptions and seals on Chinese paintings have an intertwined relationship with the entire picture, and viewers of Chinese paintings must also pay attention to them. As for the authenticity and quality of ancient paintings, that is a matter of connoisseurship, which is not the most important thing for viewers of Chinese paintings.</p>
<p>Next, we need to explain how to view Western paintings. The so-called Western paintings refer to oil paintings, watercolors, charcoal drawings, etc. They can generally be divided into three types: figures, landscapes, and still lifes. Compared with Chinese paintings, it seems that the methods, materials, and content are different, but in reality, the spirit is different. Chinese painting is transcendent, while Western painting is realistic. Chinese painting is based on the theories of Gu Kaizhi and Xie He, and "spirit resonance and life movement" is its life, which is the expression of the writer's inner spirit and emotions.</p>
<p>Starting from this theory, the attitude of depicting Chinese paintings is generally said to be freehand, while Western paintings are realistic. However, broadly speaking, Chinese painting is not necessarily unrealistic. It is only a kind of subjective realism that develops from psychological expression to objective depiction.</p>
<p>Western painting is realistic, objective, scientific, and empirical. On the canvas, the most important condition is the concept of space. In other words, on a two-dimensional surface, the objects must appear exactly like they are reflected on a photographic negative, with distance, height, size, and things on many different planes are depicted on the same plane.</p>
<p>If we compare it with the composition of Chinese paintings, it is completely different. Chinese paintings often allow a lot of blank space, as long as it can have an organic connection with the image being depicted. Therefore, in Chinese paintings, it is often enough to depict a flower or a stone to make a painting, but this is absolutely impossible in Western paintings, because what Western paintings require is the reproduction of realistic images, that is, a visual art that attempts to construct an accurate concept of space from reason.</p>
<p>The way of viewing Western paintings should pay attention to light, space, form, color, brushwork, composition, and conception. A good Western painting does not necessarily have to be meticulously depicted or have a lifelike story. The emerging Western paintings of the 20th century have indeed completely broken through traditional techniques, and it can be said that they are similar to the method of viewing Chinese paintings.</p>
<p>Finally, we should put forward the way of viewing popular paintings.</p>
<p>The so-called popular painting refers to comics and woodcuts that depict the masses, approach the masses, and instruct the masses. The content of comics and woodcuts is often full of rich propaganda, so when viewing them, people often only pay attention to the content and ignore the form, which is not desirable.</p>
<p>The conditions for an excellent comic or woodcut are that the content is realistic, and the means to express this realistic content is the basic technique of painting - realism. If there is no basis in realism and you only play some clever tricks, this kind of work cannot stand.</p>
<p>If you grasp this basic point of view, no matter how deformed or exaggerated the comic is, the inferior technique cannot be concealed. Regarding woodcuts, there can be fine and dense or coarse and large distinctions in the knife technique, and the quality of the work does not depend on the fineness or coarseness, but on whether the basic painting techniques can be fully realized. As for the content of comics and woodcuts at this stage, of course, the premise for determining their quality should be whether they can express the spirit of democracy.</p>
<h3>The Dust of the Road</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Turning a tired body, trekking from one city to another county, what is gained from the toil of the whole day, the fatigue of the journey? Apart from a face full of dust.</p>
<p>Nothing, not even vivid memories, vibrant colors, have been washed away in the torrent of time. Everything in front of me is gray, gray pedestrians, gray fields, gray universe!</p>
<p>How strong is the wind and sand in the fields? I remember the first day I left home, I was shocked by the wind and sand in front of me. I tried my best to block it, to fight it, but in the end, I was dyed with the color of the dust of the road.</p>
<p>In that faint gray-yellow color, a large period of time has passed.</p>
<p>Why do people have to walk endlessly on the gray-yellow journey?</p>
<p>On the journey, the traveler so rarely sees the original colors, the vibrant red, like the sunset dyed in the sky, the brilliant green, like the wild plants in the fields. Watching the sun sink from east to west, thinking of groups of people galloping in the fields, and new plants growing in the wind and sand, my heart is comforted.</p>
<p>Not only that, the plants grow luxuriantly under the hands of the travelers, and the footprints of the travelers increase on the long road. At that time, the fields become a lush green, and the songs of the travelers echo through the trees.</p>
<p>The traveler thinks quietly, temporarily staying in an old almshouse. Night folds into the house from under the old walls, and the heavy bell sounds like the breathing of a demon, thus interrupting his thoughts. So he gets up, tidies up his luggage, and breathes out, "Why is the wind and sand outside still so strong!" - I hope tomorrow will be a clear day!</p>
<h3>Expectation</h3>
<p>— Hong Ye</p>
<p>Pulling up the tattered curtains, facing the twinkling stars, the small night has a blue lyricism.</p>
<p>Someone is playing the piano lightly on a small building, the sad and quiet sound stirs up a trace of remembrance in the traveler, and my eyes wander far away.</p>
<p>Far, far away, that distant place beyond the sea and sky, is it the hometown that contains my endless laughter and sighs? I miss those forests, snow-capped mountains, dreamlike past events by the evergreen river, and the shepherdess on the grassland...</p>
<p>How many years has it been? Are they still the same as they were then?</p>
<p>I watched my friends return to the south; watched them covered in wind and dust, with a body full of hardship, coming from the banks of the Songhua River; from the edge of the ancient Great Wall, and returning to the city where they had whiled away countless years of my illness, telling me some of the forgotten historical deeds. And I will hold their hands and ask them earnestly: is the scenery outside the ancient village still so charming? Are the forests and snow-capped mountains still the same as before? And, and has the shepherdess by the evergreen river become more haggard?</p>
<p>So, I close my eyes, listening carefully to the vicissitudes of the sea of people, the changes of things, the only thing that remains unchanged is the dream woven by my remembrance and homesickness.</p>
<p>Waiting; waiting; waiting for me to finish my spring, I will return. Putting on my old windbreaker that I wore when I left, picking up my luggage, carrying my poetry manuscripts, and saying goodbye to each of my friends and every familiar small city and street. So, whistling softly; crossing mountains and rivers, I will return.</p>
<p>Tonight, I have endless emotions to express. Write! Write! This endlessly beautiful poem...</p>
<p>February 13, 1946</p>
<h3>Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Li Yang</p>
<p>When far away from the hometown, and walking from one foreign land to another unfamiliar land, the thoughts of the home far away in the horizon, the thoughts of the mother, will arise spontaneously. And constantly continue the tranquility of the mood.</p>
<p>The homeland does not have a sky full of beacon fires, but the wails of grief everywhere seem to be resonating everywhere, the hopes of many people have been destroyed, and the beautiful days of the past are no longer enjoyed.</p>
<p>The South has always been the place of people's dreams. But days that are too good are no longer something people can reach; only some - they exceed the scope of human morality and move towards the high mounds of supermen, their lives are always "beautiful," but they are also the most ugly. And too many people, their outstretched hands, are fragile, no, they are withered, their faces, their pupils, are no longer full, their eyes have no light of "spirit," they have even lost the instinct to walk.</p>
<p>The people in my home, I imagine that their faces must be pale, so pale that I dare not look directly at their reality. And the mothers? The mothers of all people, aren't they all living in fear?</p>
<p>Letters from some people, from distant mountains and barriers, across the sea and across the ocean, bringing some narratives, always seem to be very tragic, and the dark days make them too sad.</p>
<h3>Distance</h3>
<p>— Shi Qingmei</p>
<p>Even people who fail geometry still know that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, and besides that, all curves connecting these two points are longer than that straight line.</p>
<p>Once, we talked about the distance between people.</p>
<p>So, what is the distance between people? Is it status? Is it knowledge? Is it wealth, identity, or fame? Or is it the time and space that no one can control?...</p>
<p>But all of this is not it, all of this cannot affect the distance between people: a profound philosopher feels that a foolish man also has value worth thinking about, a colorful ball worth a thousand gold once hit the beggar who lived on food, sages and robbers will join hands, those who are destined will meet even if they are thousands of miles away, across the riverbank of time, we think of the people we liked or admired who lived thousands of years ago, and in contemplation, we might as well give them a knowing smile.</p>
<p>The distance between people is also just like the points and lines in geometry, and that line is drawn with "understanding." When understanding becomes a curve, the distance is as close as the horizon; when it becomes a straight line, even if it is far away, it seems to be close at hand. May 30, 1946</p>
<h3>Ghee</h3>
<p>— Zhang Che</p>
<p>When I held with curiosity</p>
<p>The excitement of my heart</p>
<p>And the expectation on the corners of my lips</p>
<p>The trembling wrinkles</p>
<p>With thick red lips</p>
<p>The first time I touched the yellow</p>
<p>Molten gold-like liquid</p>
<p>That essence of the Asian prairie</p>
<p>The raw fragrance</p>
<p>How wonderful it was…</p>
<p>I smelled</p>
<p>The vigor of the wild</p>
<p>And the power of the primitive</p>
<p>And the fragrance of the valley, the fragrance of the earth, the fragrance of livestock, the fragrance of green grass, the fragrance of dew, the fragrance of moonlight, the fragrance of the nomadic girl…</p>
<p>I smelled</p>
<p>I smelled</p>
<p>Under the vast, rounded blue sky</p>
<p>The fiery red sunset</p>
<p>Shining upon the gilded splendor</p>
<p>Of the boundless green grass</p>
<p>That strong heifer</p>
<p>When the occasional breeze blows down</p>
<p>The long grass</p>
<p>Sparkling in the green</p>
<p>With hair covered in gold</p>
<p>It is grass of such fragrance</p>
<p>That feeds such a strong heifer</p>
<p>And that girl</p>
<p>(With a face tanned by the sun of the plateau</p>
<p>Whose black hair is combed by the wind of the plateau</p>
<p>Having the nimble deer-like</p>
<p>Strong arms and legs</p>
<p>The flame of youth</p>
<p>Burning red on her cheeks)</p>
<p>With bare feet bathed in the clear morning dew</p>
<p>Runs to the spring in the valley</p>
<p>Beside the spring blooming with bright red wildflowers</p>
<p>Washes off her face</p>
<p>Yesterday's sleep</p>
<p>And the darkness of the night</p>
<p>Of the fur in the tent</p>
<p>And the memory of the deceased</p>
<p>The sound of the flute at dusk</p>
<p>And then washes clean</p>
<p>Fingers smelling of milk…</p>
<p>Then</p>
<p>Carrying the drops of water that have not yet dried</p>
<p>Carrying the cool fragrance of the spring water</p>
<p>She grabs the udder of that heifer</p>
<p>From that ripe steamed bun-like</p>
<p>Full udder</p>
<p>Squeezes out the gushing milk</p>
<p>Fragrant milk filling all sides</p>
<p>It is with milk of such fragrance that ghee is made</p>
<p>When I held with curiosity</p>
<p>The excitement of my heart</p>
<p>And the expectation on the corners of my lips</p>
<p>The trembling wrinkles</p>
<p>With thick red lips the first time I touched the yellow</p>
<p>Molten gold-like liquid</p>
<p>That essence of the Asian prairie</p>
<p>The raw fragrance</p>
<p>How wonderful it was…</p>
<p>Do you embroidery pillows withering in the warm rooms in the city, do you ever smell</p>
<p>Such a fresh prairie animal fragrance?</p>

<h3>A Shared Destiny (4)(3)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qing</p>
<p>Li Yun couldn't open the door, but she clearly knew Li Hua was inside, so she started crying too. This alarmed Madam Mo, who came over and called for Li Hua. Zhang Xian also followed. Hearing Madam Mo's voice, Li Hua had no choice but to open the door. Madam Mo, seeing that Li Hua's eyes were red, assumed the two young sisters had quarreled, and quickly took her hand, leading her outside. She said:</p>
<p>"Why are you arguing with your sister again for no reason?" Madam Mo half-jokingly, half-seriously questioned Li Hua.</p>
<p>Li Hua didn't say anything, and even shook off Madam Mo's hand, refusing to go out. Then, overcome with grief, she couldn't help but sob again. Li Yun, who had stopped crying, now saw Li Hua crying and mistakenly thought Li Hua was really angry with her, so she started crying again! The young sisters cried incessantly, leaving Madam Mo and Zhang Xian at a loss.</p>
<p>"These two children are still immature; they will need Master to discipline them more in the future," Madam Mo said with a smile.</p>
<p>These words further agitated Li Hua, and she involuntarily burst into loud cries, leaving Madam Mo flustered and quite annoyed, but she was embarrassed to show it with Zhang Xian present. So, she said to Li Hua in a displeased tone:</p>
<p>"What, what's wrong with you?"</p>
<p>Li Hua still didn't speak, but she didn't dare to cry loudly either.</p>
<p>"Alright! You just pull Li Hua away," Zhang Xian said to Madam Mo, "Leave Li Hua to me, I guarantee she won't cry anymore." Zhang Xian expressed confidently that he had a solution.</p>
<p>"Okay," Madam Mo said. "But this child has a bad temper; you must be understanding!" With that, Madam Mo took Li Yun and left.</p>
<p>Zhang Xian clapped his hands twice, shrugged, and walked towards Li Hua, constantly blinking his triangular eyes. This look made Li Hua feel disgusted, even scared. As he took a step closer, Li Hua took a step back, retreating to the bedside, where there was nowhere left to retreat. He gently raised his hand and picked up Li Hua. By this time, Li Hua had already stopped crying; she trembled all over as if she had been greatly frightened.</p>
<p>"Good girl! You really listen to Master and don't cry! Little darling, let Master kiss your little face!" With that, Zhang Xian brought his lips close to Li Hua's cheek.</p>
<p>"No! No!" Li Hua, terrified, tilted her head back and forcefully pushed against Zhang Xian's chin.</p>
<p>Zhang Xian's chin was grazed by Li Hua's small hand, and he was intoxicated by her beautiful, fair face. He couldn't help but forcibly kiss her head, her mouth, her eyes!</p>
<p>Li Hua was angered and humiliated, and she desperately swung her small fists, hitting Zhang Xian repeatedly, but this resistance couldn't stop Zhang Xian's barbarity. Only when he was satisfied did he automatically stop his rude behavior. Then, he pretended nothing had happened and smiled as he carried Li Hua into Shi Yu Lou's room, shouting as he walked:</p>
<p>"Madam Mo! I'm really amazing! She's stopped crying, but now she's hitting her master!"</p>
<p>Everyone looked and, sure enough, Li Hua was still hitting Zhang Xian. Madam Mo quickly scolded Li Hua.</p>
<p>"Xiao Hua, have you gone mad? How dare you hit your master?"</p>
<p>"It's alright! It's alright! A master should take a few hits first; otherwise, it's always the student getting hit, and that's not fair!" Zhang Xian said with a playful smile. He put Li Hua down, fearing that the child would tell the truth, and quickly said to Li Yun, "Xiao Yun, go and play with your sister; don't you dare cause trouble again!" Then, he winked at Madam Mo as if he were serious. "She won't cry, so don't keep fussing."</p>
<p>Li Hua stood there for a while, neither crying nor leaving, her face turning green with anger. Finally, gathering her greatest courage, she pointed at Zhang Xian, seemingly to Madam Mo and everyone in the room, and said:</p>
<p>"I, I won't learn opera from him anymore!"</p>
<p>Then, without looking back, Li Hua stubbornly walked quickly out and returned to her room.</p>
<p>"Well, Lao Zhang, she doesn't want you as her master anymore! How embarrassing!" Second Madam Weng teased.</p>
<p>And everyone laughed!</p>
<p>Zhang Xian was now both ashamed and remorseful! He was ashamed that the child had made him look foolish in front of so many people, and he regretted being so rash just now, giving the child a bad impression on the first day. If the child really refused to be taught by him, wouldn't this easy business be lost?</p>
<p>Madam Mo was somewhat surprised to see Li Hua acting so boldly today! Afraid of offending Zhang Xian because of this, she quickly apologized, saying:</p>
<p>"Master, please don't take it to heart. I told you, this child has a bad temper; she's been spoiled by her father since she was little, and she doesn't even listen to me at home. I thought she would be more sensible when she grew up, but who knew she would still be so stubborn! Please forgive her; I'll go and discipline her properly." With that, Madam Mo walked out angrily.</p>
<p>Zhang Xian quickly grabbed Madam Mo, because he had a guilty conscience; he was afraid that if this matter was exposed, it would be even worse! So, he said awkwardly:</p>
<p>"Let her go; children are like that. I'm so old; how can I be so petty with a child? You don't need to tease her anymore. She'll be fine in a while."</p>
<p>Everyone also helped Zhang Xian persuade Madam Mo. Everyone thought it was Li Hua's fault; that Li Hua had a perverse nature. Only Zhang Xian knew the truth, but he couldn't explain it for Li Hua.</p>

<h3>Under Strict Investigation by the Authorities, Rice Prices Fell Slightly Last Week; Black Market Prices for Financial Securities Also Declined Simultaneously</h3>
<p>Rice and Grains: Under the continued strict crackdown by the authorities on rice speculation last week, people's minds were at ease, speculative activities subsided, and the market gradually returned to normal. In addition, there was a large influx of goods, resulting in sluggish retail sales. Although the overall drop for the week was slight, with Changxi White Rice falling by approximately 2,000-3,000 yuan and Xian Rice falling by approximately 3,000-5,000 yuan, there was no longer the wild price jumps of the past. If the authorities continue to strictly investigate and deal with rice speculators and manipulators, and if foreign rice can be imported as soon as possible, then the great turmoil may be transformed into a calm wind and gentle waves. After rice prices stopped rising rapidly, flour and miscellaneous grains also experienced a slight related decline. Only soybean oil cake fluctuated slightly, starting weak and sluggish at the beginning of the week, then suddenly turning lively and profitable after Thursday. However, according to investigations, the city's reserves are quite abundant, so problems are unlikely to occur. The vegetable oil allocation by vegetable oil factories was temporarily suspended due to the large reserves of oil in the market. Some say that the rise in oil prices is somewhat influenced by the suspension of allocations, as market speculators seek to profit and fear having no opportunity to do so, initially without considering the actual size of market reserves.</p>
<p>Gold Bars: The black market for gold bars opened at 1.85 million yuan at the beginning of last week and closed at 1.795 million yuan at the end of the week. During the week, on Monday, due to news of a large amount of gold arriving in Shanghai, there was a lot of selling pressure, and the price fell from 1.85 million to within the 1.8 million range. In the afternoon, it further dropped to 1.755 million yuan, the lowest price of the week. From Tuesday to Thursday, the market stabilized, hovering around 1.78 million. On Friday, due to strong demand from silver shops, it rapidly rose to 1.86 million yuan, the highest price of the week. The closing price on the weekend also fell by 47,500 yuan compared to the previous week.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency: The official exchange rate for US dollar telegraphic transfers remained unchanged. The trend of US dollar notes mirrored that of gold prices. On Monday, as gold prices fell, speculators rushed to sell, and the price dropped from 2,325 yuan to 2,260 yuan, the lowest price of the week. From Tuesday to Thursday, it was generally stable. On Friday, the gold market regained strength, and the price rose to 2,370 yuan, the highest price of the week. The closing price on Saturday was 2,330 yuan, down 10 yuan compared to the previous weekend.</p>
<p>Government Bonds: The black market for Unified C Bonds opened at 7,950 yuan at the beginning of the week. Subsequently, due to the emergence of a new organization with potentially strong selling power, the market fell back. On Tuesday and Wednesday, it continued to weaken to near the 7,000 yuan level. On Thursday, due to large-scale selling by major players, it once fell to 6,650 yuan. On Friday, selling pressure remained strong, and the market was firm at first but then declined. On Saturday, there was still no improvement, and the lowest price was 6,450 yuan. During the week, the opening price on Monday was the highest, and the price of 6,450 yuan on Saturday was the lowest. The closing price on Saturday was 6,650 yuan, down 1,200 yuan from the previous weekend.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks: The market started firm at the beginning of the week but then weakened, with significant differences compared to the previous Saturday. On Tuesday, due to active short-selling, prices were generally low, with trends similar to yesterday. On Wednesday, with further pressure from short-sellers, the market declined in a roundabout way. Although there was some support towards the close, it was still lower than yesterday. On Thursday, yarn factories rose sharply, and smaller popular stocks were level with yesterday. On Friday, it was initially quite firm but then trended lower, especially at the close. As a result, Jingfu fell the most, almost on par with Xinguang. Other stocks rose and fell differently. On Saturday, trading was even quieter, with prices slightly lower than yesterday.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange: At the beginning of the week, with low gold, note, and stock prices, people were nervous, and asking prices trended lower. On Tuesday, selling pressure was widespread, and prices were again low. The British Union was the weakest. On Wednesday, the market was mixed. On Thursday, floating buyers absorbed, and all rose. On Friday, it was weak at first but then stabilized. As a result, except for Wheelock, all declined slightly. On Saturday, there was profit-taking at high prices, resulting in a decline.</p>
<p>Rayon: The spot price of 120-count Dayouguang rayon was 1.38 million yuan on Monday, down 80,000-90,000 yuan from the previous weekend. Afterwards, the market trend remained weak. Until Thursday, due to the China Textile Corporation opening prices 20,000-30,000 yuan higher than the previous time, people's sentiment turned positive, and it actually rose by 100,000 yuan that day. On Friday, outsiders sold at high prices, causing it to fall by 30,000-40,000 yuan. On the weekend, it softened again, returning to the original price on Monday. Other miscellaneous brands did not fluctuate much during the week.</p>
<p>Factory Yarn: Firm and stable. The selling price remained unchanged throughout the week. Foreign yarn, 83 points, opened at 2.5 million yuan, 81 points at 2.45 million yuan. 78 points opened at 2.3 million yuan at the beginning of the week, and then the price was 40,000-50,000 yuan higher. The price of user silk remained unchanged. Medium-grade 5 dan, 1.95 million to 2 million yuan. Ordinary 5 dan, 1.9 million to 1.95 million yuan. Dry yarn with inspection documents, the transaction price of foreign firms was 1.55 million yuan. User dry yarn was generally between 1.3 million and 1.35 million yuan. On Saturday, due to customer inquiries, the asking price was 40,000-50,000 yuan higher.</p>
<p>Silk Fabrics: Heading towards prosperity, advancing steadily. Meiya silk, the price on Saturday was 80,000-90,000 yuan higher than on Monday. Dacheng Grid was even more extreme, the price on Saturday was 350 yuan higher than on Monday. According to insiders, Dacheng Silk Factory, due to the burden of high wages, was selling prices below cost and will be forced to stop some of its work. Other silk factories are also not worried about [missing characters] and are helpless. All manufacturers are facing a crisis, and if they do not try to save the situation, there is a risk of collapse.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn: Initially, due to good demand from Tianjin and Guangdong, and the gradual rise in gold prices, the market price trended upwards. However, due to the end of the month and the lower gold prices, and because the holidays were approaching, many bulls holding spot goods began to sell, and the price trended downwards. But the result was still a slight increase overall. The highest price for the week was 2.59 million for 40 [missing character] and Blue Phoenix on Friday. The lowest was 860,000 for 10-count Delihui on Wanqi-1. In terms of count, coarse yarn was lively while fine yarn was flat. 10-count [missing characters] rose the most by 100,000. 16-count Guang [missing character] rose by 80,000. 42-count Blue Phoenix rose by 30,000. 40-count [missing character] City and 20-count Special Shuangma remained unchanged. Recently, the phenomenon of high fine yarn prices and low coarse yarn prices in the yarn market may gradually become balanced in the future.</p>
<p>Cloth Market: Demand from merchants and retailers was quite strong, and the market improved somewhat. Shilins such as Ji Meiting and Taohuagirl were 4,000-5,000 higher than the previous week. 12-pound heavy fine cloth and 6-pound Huadie coarse cloth each rose by 3,000-4,000. In addition, the price increases for other brands were slow, approximately 1,000-2,000.</p>
<p>Cotton Market: Factories and cotton merchants were still purchasing, and the market was not deserted. The market price was lively for coarse lint raw materials but flat for fine lint raw materials. On the weekend, the factory price for Pudong Huo Ji reached as high as 100,000 yuan, on par with US cotton Mittel.</p>

<h3>Zhu Xuefan Proposes Promoting Cooperative Factories to Settle Unemployed Workers Arriving in Shanghai and Resolve the Issue of Excessive Wages</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Cooperative factories are a product of modern times and can help eliminate labor-management disputes, raise the status and responsibility of workers. After the victory, the Ministry of Social Affairs issued an order promoting them. The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau also repeatedly consulted with the Enemy and Puppet Assets Disposal Bureau, requesting the allocation of one or two enemy and puppet factories for pilot projects, but no agreement has been reached. When unemployed workers from Chongqing recently petitioned for jobs in Shanghai, Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the Federation of Labor Unions, suggested that it was difficult to place them all at once, and also proposed running cooperative factories to provide relief. According to Zhu, in addition to this, he also intends to use this cooperative spirit to solve the current problem of excessive wages. He said that he is currently drafting a plan to promote cooperative factories as a principle for labor-management cooperation during this economic and industrial crisis period. He believes that the development of the economic crisis not only makes it difficult for small factories to maintain operations, but also makes it impossible for general factories to bear labor costs due to the rising cost of living. The current wages exceed the price of raw materials, and the trend is very obvious. Therefore, Minister Gu pointed out that the industrial crisis is also a crisis for the workers themselves, and said that if factories are not operating well or have real difficulties and cannot pay wages according to the cost of living, labor and management can negotiate on their own or reduce wages through an arbitration method. However, he believes that the increase in the cost of living means that the labor remuneration obtained by workers has not actually changed, but only maintains a certain standard. This standard is a right that labor should have and should not be changed. He suggests establishing a labor-management cooperative system in factories, that is, the wages that the factory cannot bear should be voluntarily invested by the labor side to purchase the factory's shares. In this way, the factory's burden is reduced, the workers avoid losing the opportunity to work, and also obtain the corresponding profit. The worker becomes a part of the business, and should fulfill the corresponding obligations and rights. This economic cooperation between labor and management will be more thorough than spiritual cooperation. He also said that this system is the first of its kind in our country, and difficulties are inevitable. In addition to making suggestions to the government, he will also invite the press in the next few days to solicit public opinion and opinions from the business community. The worker's meeting convened by the Federation of Labor Unions today will also discuss it, and he also said that cooperative factories are also the best way to solve the problem of unemployed workers. He is currently consulting with the Ministry of Economic Affairs to allocate factories that have not yet started construction to accommodate unemployed workers from the rear and Shanghai, and to carry out pilot projects first, managed by the state, so that a huge amount of labor will no longer be wasted.</p>
<h3>Tianjin and Shanghai Have Similar Methods for Suppressing Grain Prices</h3>
<p>[Tianjin News] In order to stabilize food prices for the people, the Tianjin Social Affairs Bureau convened a meeting on the 24th of last month with representatives from wholesale grain merchants, retail grain merchants, and the Sanjin Flour Mill Association, as well as representatives from relevant agencies. The following two measures were decided: (1) Strictly crack down on horizontal transactions and prohibit hoarding and speculation. (2) Prohibit non-industry personnel from purchasing in large quantities. The amount of grain stored by all merchants should be reported on a regular basis. The Bureau will properly formulate measures to implement these two measures seriously.</p>
<h3>Another New American Rice Variety Successfully Tested</h3>

Whether it is carrying rice to Shanghai is not specified in the telegram.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Sold Over 40 Billion Yuan Worth of Enemy and Puppet Assets in May</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Enemy and Puppet Assets Disposal Bureau recently announced that in May, it entrusted the Jianghai Customs to auction enemy and puppet assets ten times and auction twice, with a total income of approximately 2.5 billion yuan. It also entrusted the Central Trust Bureau to auction eight times and auction twice, with a total income of approximately 5.5 billion yuan. In addition, it entrusted the China Textile Construction Company, the China Vegetable Oil Factory, the China Paper Industry Corporation, and other institutions to dispose of a large number of enemy and puppet assets, with cloth and rayon accounting for the largest number. Detailed statistics have not yet been received, but according to a spokesman for the Bureau, the value of assets sold in May in Shanghai alone was approximately 40 billion yuan, far more than in April.</p>
<h3>Measures Decided for Dealing with Illegal Sale of Assets</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Enemy and Puppet Assets Disposal Bureau passed measures yesterday for dealing with the illegal sale of enemy and puppet assets by receiving personnel. (1) If it is determined that the buyer and seller colluded, or the buyer knowingly purchased the assets, the assets will be confiscated. (2) If it is determined that both the buyer and seller were unaware and acted in good faith, they will be given a deadline to report to the Disposal Bureau for review. If verified to be true, they will be exempted from prosecution, but the seller will still be responsible for compensation. The Bureau has issued orders to its offices and branch offices in various locations to implement these measures.</p>

<h3>Urgently Needed: Textile Spindle Tape Factory</h3>
<p>— Zheng Jian</p>
<p>(1) Introduction: Since the Industrial Revolution, the textile industry has evolved from handicraft to machine industry. Inventions and improvements have achieved amazing results from time to time, resulting in more refined technology and more advanced production. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said that the most important thing in nation-building is the people's livelihood. The problem of people's livelihood includes clothing, food, housing, transportation, education, and entertainment, etc., which have long been deeply considered by the whole country.</p>
<p>Clothing belongs to the textile industry. At the beginning of nation-building today, the government has been working hard to rectify the textile industry and gradually restore production. However, it has not paid attention to small-scale textile industries, which is a pity. The spindle tape industry is a kind of textile industry and is also one of the materials used in textile factories, but its quality is of great importance to the output and benefits of the entire yarn spinning.</p>
<p>(2) History: In 1887, the famous textile machinery manufacturer Dobson Factory in the United Kingdom, a leading country in the European textile industry, first researched and improved the spindle tape, changing the original round spindle rope into a flat spindle tape. The experiment was successful, and it was well received by textile factories everywhere. The advantages are as follows: (1) The twist of the yarn is uniform; (2) Reduce mechanical devices, such as changing the original double roller to _ roller transmission; (3) Reduce horsepower and save expenses; (4) The running time of the spindle tape is longer than that of the round rope, which reduces breakage and empty spindles, and increases production. In 1908, 80% to 90% of the yarn spindles in textile factories in Europe and the United States used spindle tapes for transmission. Later, after the textile industry rose in our country, it also followed into our country's textile industry.</p>
<p>(3) Establishment Time of Domestic Spindle Tape: Our country established the first spindle tape factory in the third year of the Republic of China, _ during the European War, when the source of foreign goods was cut off. At this time, our _ cotton spinning industry was in a period of revival. Mr. Wu in the textile industry, in view of this, engaged in organization and stepped up the process. He successfully planned and established a factory on Qiwupu Road in Shanghai in the summer of the third year of the Republic of China. However, at first, the people of the country did not pay attention to this _. Mr. Wu and others suffered from a shortage of funds and simple equipment, with only 20 looms. Fortunately, after many years of hard work, the products were gradually improved and surpassed foreign goods, and then they were adopted by the national textile industry, and their reputation increased day by day. When the European War stopped, the major powers produced large quantities of textiles, which were transported and sold to our country. From then on, our country's cotton spinning industry declined again, and the spindle tape industry followed suit. Fortunately, Mr. Wu struggled with courage and sincerity. At that time, the factory increased the production of military textiles to increase income. The spindle tapes produced by the factory were marked with __, ___ and used ships as commercial strongholds. When the August 13th Shanghai battle broke out in the 26th year of the Republic, the factory was forced to stop.</p>
<p>In the spring of the 27th year of the Republic, Mr. Wu again worked hard to run around to find ways to move the important parts of the factory into the former French Concession to prepare for resuming production. Later, due to the urgent need for military cotton weaving by the government, he was instructed to move again. Finally, in the winter of the 27th year of the Republic, Mr. Wu led the entire staff and machines to Hong Kong and jointly established a cotton weaving factory with the local Baoan Industrial Company to expand the scope. The author was in charge of the engineering work in the factory at that time. After six months, all the original looms and the added looms, a total of more than 300, were carefully organized and arranged, and production continued.</p>
<p>At the beginning, because the Baoan Company mainly produced gas masks, all the cotton fabrics were woven by the cotton weaving department, such as mask bags, shoulder straps, and headband tubes. By 1939, Germany launched World War II, and many countries were involved in the war. In 1940, a part of the cotton weaving industry in the United Kingdom was converted into the military industry, and a part of the military cotton fabrics was entrusted to major factories in Hong Kong to undertake. The factory was also allocated a large number of weaving quantities and was engaged in production. Unexpectedly, at the end of the year, the Japanese launched the Pacific War, and the factory was destroyed by artillery fire. Mr. Wu's thirty years of painstaking management has been reduced to ashes. Now Mr. Wu is planning to restore this business in Chongqing, but he is suffering from weak economic strength and cannot fulfill his wish. He can only sigh at the ocean.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the founding of the country today, and in today's days when industry is waiting to be revived, and in the future national plan to implement a thousand spindles factory, the spindle tape industry should be reorganized, and only a few companies in Shanghai were engaged in this business a month ago. Most of the equipment is not complete and the production is small. In the future, we must expand in time, work hard to prepare, and provide applications to avoid foreign goods flooding the market and money overflowing. The author believes that it is appropriate to use part of the enemy and puppet textile factories for the application of this industry.</p>
<h3>Burying Ourselves in Construction</h3>
<p>— Lin Han</p>
<p>For decades, our country has suffered from the aggression and exploitation of imperialists. The loss of land is of course extremely heartbreaking, but the invisible shackles and ruthless magic hands of imperialists have obtained our country's markets, plundered our country's resources, and sucked the people's fat through the privileges under unequal treaties, almost making our country sink invisibly into an irrecoverable and miserable situation; eight years of brutal war has destroyed all the little foundation that had survived under the economic aggression of imperialists. Our country after the victorious end of the war is just like an elderly person who has recovered from a serious illness, and urgently needs nourishment and recuperation. If _ _ is done properly, it may not be _ _ "rejuvenated"!</p>
<p>What is the _ of "rejuvenation"? In a nutshell, it is "burying ourselves in construction." Constructing politics, constructing science, constructing people's livelihood, and constructing national defense. Now is the time when everything has to be constructed! Regarding politics and national defense, we will not discuss them for the time being, but let's talk about "catching up" in science and "production and construction" in people's livelihood. As early as the 19th century, when the steam engine was invented and widely used, we should have stepped up to catch up with others in time. Now others have rapidly progressed to the era of developing the inexhaustible "atomic energy," and we are still walking slowly, looking _ and out of reach. Looking through the history of the development of science and industry in our country in recent decades, we have never had any performance that surpassed others or kept pace with them. How can such a country not be backward and decline? Now we are lucky enough to win the War of Resistance, and all so-called special rights—invisible tools of aggression by imperialists—have been abolished, sovereignty has been completed, and all obstacles to construction have been cleared. Moreover, the strong enemy of the domestic goods market before the war—Japan's _ _ is extremely _ _ _ _ ; these internal conditions and external environment can be said to be the most _ _ builders.</p>
<p>According to _, the Japanese after the defeat do 14 hours of work every day, burying themselves in hard work and plotting to revive! I remember Nelson, the Director of the US Production Bureau, said, "Unless a new country producing cheap goods emerges in the East to supply the foreign markets that Japan possessed before the war, Japan's industry will soon once again hold the bull's ear in the Far East, and Japan will once again become an imperialist aggressor." "If China can replace Japan as the leading industrial country in the East after the war, it will not only be fortunate for the United States, but also for the whole world." Can we deny this obvious view? Japan is struggling to turn over, and friendly countries are urging us, caring for us, and we should also be alert, self-motivated, and seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to bury ourselves in construction, and not let the revolution of decades, the hard battle of eight years, and the hard-won opportunity of a thousand years be wasted.</p>
<h3>Making Mobile Homes Affordable for the Common People – The United States Prepares for Mass Production</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>After the end of the war, in the whole world, in addition to the food shortage, the housing problem is also very serious. It goes without saying that countries that directly encountered the war, such as England, France, the Soviet Union, and Germany, had many cities where a lot of houses were damaged during the war. Even the United States, which was not bombed by the enemy, is also experiencing a housing shortage.</p>
<p>To solve the housing problem, given the current situation, it is of course necessary to build thousands of houses, but this is impossible in terms of time and manpower. How can it be completed in a short period of time? Even the raw materials have become a problem. Because during the war, all factories that manufactured building materials and furniture were concentrated on manufacturing military supplies. Therefore, Americans believe that the most rapid and effective solution to the housing shortage is to mass-produce mobile homes.</p>
<p>In order to meet this need, mass production of mobile homes in the United States in the short term is inevitable. Now, there are already many construction companies in the entire United States that are conducting or planning to build mobile homes. What they pay attention to is, on the one hand, mass production; on the other hand, seeking to make them affordable for the common people; at the same time, they also pay attention to publicity work, so that people in general can trust mobile homes.</p>
<p>In fact, American construction companies had already started building mobile homes before the war, but they were not noticed at that time. Today, after the war, mobile homes are now receiving attention and becoming popular because of the housing _ _. Especially during the war years, mobile homes made many contributions to the military, serving as guard posts, barracks, and _ head workers' dormitories for the US military. Therefore, all _ mobile homes produced at that time were used entirely for military purposes.</p>
<p>Now that the war is over, mobile homes must of course be transferred from military use to civilian use. From now on, the mobile homes manufactured by various companies will be sold publicly on the market, and the styles will also be different from those during the war, and will be more exquisite and beautiful. Moreover, _ _ is determined by how many people are in your family and what kind of house you need, and determining one or two floors, three or four rooms, or seven or eight rooms.</p>
<p>Given the current situation, throughout the United States, old companies are expanding their scope, and new companies are being established, and everyone is focusing on manufacturing mobile homes. Moreover, they pay attention to making them affordable for the common people, reducing costs as much as possible, and making the selling price as low as possible, with the simplest ones costing around US$2,000. This is already suitable for the economic power of an average worker in the United States. The intensity of the competition is obvious to everyone.</p>
<p>And we believe that the production of mobile homes will soon expand from the United States to all parts of the world. Because recently, many people from various countries have been sent to the United States to study mobile homes. _ England has already converted several aircraft factories to manufacture mobile homes. Therefore, it is not difficult for us to imagine that in a few years, this new business will surely expand to countries all over the world!</p>
<h3>Labor Unrest and Law Abiding</h3>
<p>— Han Ju</p>
<p>Whether a country is well-governed and whether its politics are on the right track depends on whether the government can achieve the rule of law and whether the people have a spirit of law-abiding.</p>
<p>Unemployed workers from the rear who came to Shanghai petitioned the social organization to resume work the other day, resulting in a riot, smashing glass windows and public property, confiscating security guards' firearms, and holding the front and back doors, prohibiting personnel from entering and exiting. Fortunately, the authorities responded effectively, so no tragedy occurred. This is the most serious phenomenon since the beginning of the labor unrest in Shanghai. The day before, Mayor Wu and Minister Gu announced five measures to deal with labor unrest, only the first of which was to "severely punish those who incite labor unrest" and the fifth was to "laborers should absolutely abide by discipline." Only one day apart, in the workers' petition the day before yesterday, they even went so far as to show off coffins and stretchers first, and then sent out thugs to stage a full-scale fight with the Social Bureau first, assaulting the police, seizing guns, destroying property, and injuring people, which was no different from directly provoking Mayor Wu's labor policy.</p>
<p>We certainly do not discuss whether there are other backgrounds to this incident, but that their actions have obviously exceeded the scope of purely economic labor unrest is beyond _ narration. It is true that these unemployed workers made contributions to the War of Resistance and helped production in the rear, and should be given priority to resume work after arriving in Shanghai. This is the worker's _ reasonable request, and the government should first find a way to settle them down to comfort their loyalty, which can be said to be _ selfless. However, their adoption of this riotous method has not only lost the sympathy of the social community, but is also a perverse act that completely violates the law and obstructs the country from moving towards construction. We advocate severely punishing the masterminds who incited and committed violence.</p>
<p>They are all unemployed workers who came to Shanghai from the rear, and during the War of Resistance, they sweated and suffered _ to stay at their posts and assist the government, and never went on strike or were lazy, and never staged this full _ line. Although the War of Resistance has now been won, the country is still in the most difficult situation. If we want to build a brilliant and bright new China, we must take steps to speed up production. The workers in the rear should not forget their glorious history in the past, and should not disgrace the spirit of loyalty to the country in the past. They are all engineers of the new China, and should be honest and law-abiding. On the one hand, they should use reasonable methods to achieve the purpose of employment, and on the other hand, they must not be emotional, so as not to destroy the fragile foundation of the country.</p>
<h3>An Introduction to Mutual Consultation Management</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Because he is willing to take responsibility, what he says becomes actionable, thus gaining the trust of his subordinates and enabling his decisions to be implemented.</p>
<p>In the business field, we often hear people say that someone "speaks with shoulders," which actually means taking responsibility. A person who is willing to take responsibility can gain the trust of both superiors and subordinates, and can also make outsiders trust his every move, thus creating opportunities for his success.</p>
<p>Three, the ability to observe: To solve various problems, you must first study where the center of the problem is. Therefore, the ability to observe is also quite important. When we encounter problems, if we do not analyze them, we will not be able to see where the problem lies. We must bring out the main center of a problem. Separating the center of the problem requires the ability to observe.</p>
<p>Four, collect information: The difference between a person who can make accurate decisions and a person who makes wrong judgments is often the difference between whether the information is collected sufficiently. When we are studying a problem and need to solve it, we must first collect as much information as possible about the problem as a basis for the solution, because without that information—facts—guessing out of thin air, the judgment made will not be accurate.</p>
<p>At the same time, we must also pay attention to whether the collected information is accurate. If the collected information is not accurate, then the judgment made cannot be accurate.</p>
<p>Five, concentrate your thoughts: To solve a problem, you must concentrate your thoughts when studying it and must not be casual. In management law, there is a principle that:</p>
<p>"A person who can do things well is a person who can concentrate his thoughts on the problem and eliminate all other distractions in the process of planning a solution to the problem."</p>
<p>Six, ideals: Ideals are also very important. When solving a problem, we must think about all aspects of the problem and all possible consequences. A person without the ability to idealize often only thinks about the surface of things and problems, and inevitably overlooks this and loses that.</p>
<p>The above points are all necessary conditions that must be cultivated in terms of cultivating a sound mind.</p>
<p>Foreword</p>
<p>Before talking about the various problems of the production organization, we can say something about the purpose of running industrial and commercial enterprises. In this regard, it can be said that the purpose of any enterprise is to obtain profits, although the acquisition of these profits can be divided into short-term and future types. Many enterprises can obtain considerable profits after they are established, but there are also some enterprises that must undergo a considerable period of hard work before they can obtain profits. There are also some people who run a business for their own reputation or status. Their purpose is not to obtain monetary benefits, but the increase in reputation and status can also be said to be a kind of benefit. Therefore, when talking about whether an enterprise is successful, it is often necessary to ask whether it can make investors have considerable profits.</p>

<h3>New Lotus Emerging from Water, Pleasure Boats Like Shuttles – A Nanjing Panorama</h3>
<p>— Nanjing, 28th Day Correspondence, Zhi Nan</p>
<p>Nanjing seems to be undergoing a transformation, but many things and phenomena happening now indeed require a high degree of vigilance and even more so, clear handling. In the future, there will be more and more people. If some problems that affect citizens deeply are not resolved early, dealing with them in the future will be extremely difficult. Here, we would like to provide a concise sketch of the capital.</p>
<p>Xuanwu Lake's Scenery Approaching a Golden Age</p>
<p>Spring is late, and the weather is charmingly fine, not yet sweltering. Friends arriving by plane from Chongqing cannot help but be surprised upon their arrival, truly fitting the line of a poem: "If you arrive in Jiangnan to catch the spring, be sure to stay with the spring." The changes in Jiangnan's weather make it easy for people to adapt. On rainy days, looking out from a high-rise window, the Stone City in the misty rain has a unique charm. Walking on the streets on rainy days is unlike Chongqing, where mud splashes everywhere. As vehicles pass, pedestrians must "bow" to them, using umbrellas as shields. However, the alleys here become canals on rainy days, and one must wade through the water to pass.</p>
<p>The dance halls that were once bustling are now deserted. The Nanjing Central Daily was the first to propose a ban on dancing. After the ban was issued, dancers, musicians, managers, and others petitioned for the resumption of business, but the result was disappointing. Thus, dance halls turned into music tea houses. Some dancers transformed into singer-like socialites, some yearned for a lifelong partner, and some slipped away to Shanghai to continue their life of entertainment. Are the dancers willingly lonely? Listening to Qingchang at the Confucius Temple is another kind of stimulation. At the same time, the sounds of impromptu dances can also be heard from private parties from time to time. The only difference from before is that those former dancers mostly look pale and haggard.</p>
<p>The invisible footsteps of summer are gradually approaching. Within the city, water trucks have already been deployed, and fashionable ladies are wearing their sunglasses. Jeeps come and go like flying arrows, with news of injuries every day. Every holiday, Xuanwu Lake and Bailuzhou are crowded with tourists. New lotus flowers emerge from the water on the lake, and pleasure boats move like shuttles. The next two months will naturally be the golden period for Xuanwu Lake. Tea houses and restaurants by the lake also spring up in response. The seats are always full. The pleasure boats use white cloth as awnings, and inside are placed lounge chairs and small square tables, seating twelve, eight, or six people, depending on the boat. Because there are many tourists, the prices are also high. There is also a type of light boat that only accommodates two passengers, and the price is slightly lower.</p>
<p>Newspaper Humor Points Out Serious Housing Shortage</p>
<p>Recently, a certain newspaper in Nanjing used a humorous tone to say, "Housing matters are serious!" Using such an inelegant phrase to describe the current housing shortage makes people feel both amused and helpless! People returning to the capital are coming from the water and from the air, increasing day by day. As soon as they arrive in the capital, everyone feels a headache over the housing problem. Although Nanjing is large and there are many Western-style houses, they are irrelevant to them. Many people are forced to use small hotels as their temporary homes, and some are willing to endure coldness and neglect to live with relatives and friends. Even if they find a house, the deposit and rent are often shockingly high, making it unaffordable for those below the middle class. According to official announcements, the population of Nanjing before the war was about 1.3 million, but now it is only 700,000. Judging from these two figures, Nanjing should not have a so-called housing shortage phenomenon. The occurrence of the housing problem is still mainly due to man-made factors. Now, those who own property in Nanjing are getting rich, while the lower and middle-class public employees who rent houses are getting poorer.</p>
<p>The evening newspaper the day before yesterday published a news item: "Landlord forces tenant to move out, tenant in desperation jumps into the river." Yesterday's Central Daily published an article by its president, Ma Xingye, titled "Two Examples, One Appeal." The two examples are: "The first thing is that the landlord of a certain address in Tianjiying proposed to me that the monthly rent for the residence of one of our editors be increased from 40,000 yuan to 300,000 yuan, and the deposit from 100,000 yuan to 1 million yuan. The second thing is that the local court sent me a summons, asking me to appear in court on the morning of May 30 because my landlord wanted to sell the house I lived in, saying that the contract I signed with him was invalid and that I did not allow him to sell it." Such things are indeed only one or two grains of sand in the Ganges. In recent months, unscrupulous merchants have been "digging houses," increasing housing prices by an unknown number of times. No wonder President Ma said with激昂 and vigor, "You cannot obediently dedicate all your monthly income to your landlord and let yourself, your parents, and your wife starve to death! You cannot pawn your remaining clothes and sell your remaining luggage to make up for your monthly rent! If you are not corrupt and you do not make wartime fortunes, what can you do to find a place to live? Honest readers: I have never wasted even a penny, I don't smoke, I don't drink, I don't dance, I don't gamble, I have never asked this society for unreasonable enjoyment, but this society says: You deserve to sleep on the street! And this society says: You must offer your landlord 300,000 yuan every month! I can't figure out this logic no matter what!"</p>
<p>It is said that the municipal government and the police department have begun to investigate the city's houses, and if there are any vacant ones, they will force them to be rented out, not allowing them to be held for a higher price. This move is a bit late, but if it is done effectively, it will be barely satisfactory.</p>
<p>Flowing Downstream, Rice Flows to Shanghai</p>
<p>More and more people are struggling on the line of life! Life has deprived people of their interest and shattered their ambitions. People worry about firewood, rice, oil, and salt every day. Gold and rice seem like two strong winds, spiraling upwards! The rise and fall of gold do not directly affect the citizens, but the soaring price of grain makes the average person dumbfounded and sigh in despair! It was only 30,000 yuan last month, and everyone already felt it was difficult to bear. However, in less than half a month, it jumped upwards from 30,000 yuan. Each jump made people's nerves tense. The 40,000 yuan mark was crossed, and then it passed 50,000 yuan. It seems the trend is still upward! Is the shortage of rice due to something? No! Just like many other ugly things, it turns out that someone is secretly manipulating it! Several newspapers have put forward the proposal to severely punish "rice pests," but it has had no impact. The trend of rising rice prices remains the same! The common people tremble under the rising rice prices! Although the authorities also want to make some efforts in this regard, there is the so-called "negotiated price," but the negotiated price is too low, which has created a phenomenon of having a market but no rice. The rice on the riverside simply does not come up and flows downstream to Shanghai. Therefore, the negotiated price is also changing at any time. In fact, if the authorities really come up with a way and have the courage to stabilize the grain price at a reasonable number, it is not unfeasible. However, due to unsound organization, complex personnel, the efforts of the municipal government are almost in vain,扶得東來西又倒！</p>
<p>At the end of the Provisional Senate, there was a pleasant ending: the Grain Commissioner agreed to the request of the Provisional Senate and would sell 70,000 shi of rice stored in Nanjing at a fair price to the market. It has been almost a month since the Provisional Senate closed, and this matter, apart from giving people a little comfort at the time, has not been followed up! Recently, because the price of rice has risen so fast, the senators remembered this check and asked for it to be cashed, but as time went on, there were naturally many changes. To this day, these 70,000 shi of rice are still a mystery in people's hearts!</p>
<p>Every morning, housewives carry baskets to the market to buy vegetables. The lowest vegetables cost 350 yuan per jin, and meat has also risen to 1,200 yuan. The money spent every day is still the same as before, but the vegetables in the basket are decreasing day by day. The weight in the basket is decreasing every day, but the weight in the housewife's heart is increasing every day.</p>
<p>More People Watching, Fewer People Buying</p>
<p>The social crisis and the economic crisis are like a deep pool, and the prosperity of the market is like duckweed on the water, covering everything!</p>
<p>All kinds of large stores are emerging like bamboo shoots after the rain. When they open, they even invite female stars from Shanghai to cut the ribbon, as a living advertisement! The newly established Yishi Broadcasting Station seems to have become a base for merchants to promote their products. After singing a song, there is an ear-piercing introduction of how good the goods are and how low the prices are at a certain company or store, and inviting all ladies to visit, which is a completely Shanghai-style approach! At night, neon lights illuminate the night sky with a riot of colors, and the music from the radio is melodious. On the bustling Taiping Road and Zhongshan Road, pedestrians are bustling. Almost all of the products displayed in the windows are American goods. Newly arrived glass handbags and glass shoes attract fashionable women to stop and examine them carefully. Because Nanjing and Shanghai are so close, any imported goods shipped to Shanghai from overseas will naturally appear in Nanjing in a few days. Generally speaking, people have a great interest in foreign goods, thinking of following the foreign lifestyle step by step, and no one has ever thought about the crisis in the national industry caused by the influx of foreign goods. But on the other hand, although foreign goods are plentiful, the national economic capacity is far lower than before the war, and coupled with rising prices, the income of salaried classes cannot increase in proportion, so the purchasing power of the average person is greatly reduced. No matter how much merchandise is displayed in the glass windows and how loud the music is, it cannot stimulate the vitality of the market. More people are watching, and fewer people are buying.</p>
<p>At present, at least half of Nanjing's prosperity can be said to be built on a luxurious atmosphere. The Confucius Temple in the south of the city is still a den of consumption and a paradise for the moneyed class. In the evening, cars are lined up in a long snake formation on the side of the road, and the restaurants are packed. Big merchants, wealthy businessmen, officials and dignitaries spend hundreds of thousands of gold coins without any stinginess! It seems that China is not suffering from famine, and the death of 30 million people is also a "rumor!"</p>
<p>Lamenting: "Nanjing Has No Culture"</p>
<p>This is a desert, without a sprout of culture!</p>
<p>Recently, someone said in the newspaper with great emotion: "Nanjing has no culture." This is not an exaggeration. Intellectuals are like fish, and culture is like water. They need culture to nourish them. However, such a large Nanjing is like a desert. The most strange thing is that people are generally addicted to sensual pleasures and show no concern for the cultural wasteland. Many cultural people came from Chongqing, but they seem to have no interest in Nanjing and all concentrated in Shanghai. To this day, there is no solid publication here, no large-scale cultural activities, but a general atmosphere of luxury and pleasure covers everything. There is no decent bookstore. The messy small bookstores mostly display Shanghai-style tabloids and sexual erotic books. There is also no decent library or sports field.</p>
<p>Taking drama as an example, it is pathetically weak. The only embellishment is Tang Huaiqiu's China Traveling Troupe, but it is only an embellishment and does not have a large audience. When the troupe performs a new play, it never shows the cast list to the public, but instead calls for "Miss So-and-so's participation in the performance." Some time ago, they even invited a female star from Shanghai in an attempt to attract audiences. From this point of view, it is enough to prove that they have not yet broken away from star worship. As for the number of performances, it has not exceeded twenty or thirty shows. It is said that the Central Youth Theatre Troupe has all returned to the capital and is planning to perform "Unofficial History of the Qing Palace" or "Peach Blossom Fan." This vital force in the theatrical world may break the current silence.</p>
<p>Recently, some people have been worried about their children's schooling. Of course, recovery is not restoration, but even restoration has not been achieved in education. Taking primary schools as an example, there were 200 schools before the war, with 100,000 students, but now there are only 70 schools, which can only accommodate 28,000 students. Many people came from Chongqing, but their children have nowhere to study. Letting them roam the streets all day is not a form of education!</p>
<p>From all aspects, Nanjing is gradually transforming, but it is inevitable that light and darkness, progress and backwardness, two forces are still competing. If the citizens of Nanjing are not blinded by profit, their future will inevitably become more and more splendid.</p>
<h3>One Jin of Tea, Three Jin of Rice: Zhejiang's Tea Exports are Dim</h3>
<p>Everyone knows that Longjing tea is a famous tea in Zhejiang, but they don't know that the tea for export is not Longjing. This kind of Zhejiang export tea, however, greatly benefits Zhejiang's economy. Of the seventy-five counties, fifty-five counties are tea-producing. It can be said that at least two-thirds of the people in Zhejiang have a close relationship with tea.</p>
<p>Pingshui Area's Green Pearl Tea Sells Well Overseas</p>
<p>The most popular in foreign countries is the Green Pearl Tea from the Pingshui area. Pingshui includes Shaoxing, Sheng County, Xinchang, Shangyu, Yuyao, Zhuji, Yin County, Cixi, Fenghua, Tiantai, and Dongyang counties. The pearl tea produced in these counties is made into small round balls, hence the name. Then there is the Green Eyebrow Tea from the Suichun area, including Chun'an, Sui'an, and Kaihua counties. Next is the black tea from the Wenzhou area, including Yongjia, Rui'an, Pingyang, Taishun, and Leqing counties. In addition, there are also tea-producing areas in Linhai, Xianju, Huangyan, Ninghai, Wenling, Jinhua, Wuyi, Pujiang, Yongkang, Pan'an, Yiwu, Jiande, Changshan, Jiangshan, Tangxi, Shouchang, Qingtian, Lishui, Songyang, Suichang, Xuanping, Yunhe, Jingning, Longquan, Qingyuan, Yuqian, Xiaofeng, Anji, Fenshui, Changhua, Xindeng, Tonglu, Fuyang, Lin'an, Yuhang, and Hangzhou. Among them, according to recent surveys, the largest tea-producing area is Sheng County, with 80,889 mu, and a tea yield of 48,102 dan. The tea garden area in the Pingshui area is 218,099 mu, and the tea yield is 138,125 dan. The tea-producing area in the Suichun area is 58,741 mu, and the tea yield is 27,788 dan. The tea garden area in the Wenzhou area is 27,780 mu, and the tea yield is 23,230 dan. In the fifty-four counties, excluding Yuhang and Hangzhou, the total tea garden area is 465,348 mu, and the yield is 277,629 dan. Among them, the Pingshui, Suichun, and Wenzhou areas are the main areas for export tea, while the other counties are mainly for domestic sales.</p>
<p>Years of War Impact, Output Declines</p>
<p>During the heyday of our country's export tea, the total export volume reached 2 million dan. After the First World War, various countries started to plant tea and improve tea varieties, which led to a sharp decline in exports to only 50,000 to 60,000 dan, while our Zhejiang's export tea accounted for 200,000 dan, accounting for one-third of the country's tea exports. There was a saying in Zhejiang's tea-producing areas: "One jin of tea, three jin of rice," which meant that one jin of tea could be exchanged for three jin of rice, which shows that the price of tea was higher than the price of rice at that time.</p>
<p>After the War of Resistance Against Japan, exports declined even more. Domestic sales were also greatly affected due to the war. In the Pingshui area, the output in 1937 was calculated in hundreds of thousands of dan, but in 1940, the output decreased by 20,000 dan, in 1941 by 160,000 dan, in 1942 by 230,000 dan, and in 1943 by 280,000 dan. Until 1946, the government and the public called for operating the tea industry, and the output was勉强 increased, but it was still 180,000 dan less than in 1937, totaling only 138,125 dan. The other Wenzhou, Suichun, and other regions also decreased proportionally.</p>
<p>Tea Farmers Chop Down Tea Trees, Tears Falling Sadly</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance Against Japan, many tea-producing counties in Zhejiang were partially occupied by the enemy, and the tea farmers had no intention of aiding the enemy. They endured hardships and looked forward to the arrival of victory. Now that victory has arrived, the government and banks have indeed provided large amounts of funds to lend to tea farmers, and some banks even purchased tea. Tea merchants have also gradually recovered. But at the same time, it has also brought shadows, that is, the excessive rise in prices has made the cost of tea particularly high. From picking leaves, making tea, to packing and shipping out, every hundred jin will cost more than 100,000 yuan, and the freight is not included. However, the current purchase price of tea is only 50,000 yuan, which makes tea farmers feel disheartened and disappointed. Therefore, some have chopped down old tea trees, and some have even dug up the roots. They face the many tea trees that they have depended on for life that have been chopped down, sigh and shed tears, and many even commit suicide.</p>
<p>Propose Three Steps to Protect Tea Farmers</p>
<p>The reason for the purchase price of only 50,000 yuan is also because foreign tea varieties have been improved and the manufacturing method has been improved, so foreign tea is better than domestic export tea. It is said that Ceylon black tea only sells for 35 cents a pound in US dollars, and its color, aroma, and taste are far better than Zhejiang black tea. Foreigners drink tea to refresh themselves, which is different from the way Chinese people slowly savor it, so they like stimulation, and foreign tea has that condition.</p>
<p>If we let our tea industry develop naturally without improvement or research, it will eventually be eliminated. The result of the elimination, taking Zhejiang as an example, is that the five or six million tea farmers who are directly engaged in tea production will lose their jobs or be forced to go elsewhere. The tragic consequences are really unimaginable.</p>
<p>We hope that the government will do its best to protect these many tea farmers. The first step is to lend money for purchase when the cost is too high, that is, half of the loan should be given to tea farmers and half should be used as the price for purchasing tea. The second step is to find ways to publicize abroad. The excellent varieties of tea in our country and plans for vigorous improvement. The third step is to make every effort to improve tea varieties. , research brewing methods. Regarding these, the government should encourage people engaged in the tea industry to operate the tea business. During the operation period, it is hoped that they can do more to think about the tea farmers and less to think about their own private interests. In this way, there may still be a great future. Otherwise, our country's foreign tea market will gradually disappear, but foreign tea will gradually be discovered in our country's market. We have already met many friends who love to drink Ceylon black tea and foreign tea.</p>

<h3>Is This How Reorganization Is Done?</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor: None of us can deny that building a nation must begin with reorganizing the army. If the army is not reorganized, the nation cannot embark on the path to prosperity and strength. Now that the troops have been gradually reorganized according to procedure, we, who have become "redundant" due to the reorganization, cannot help but feel: "Is this how reorganization is done?" This is not to say that we are dissatisfied with the reorganization or have any slight resentment. However, considering the high-ranking officers in the army who are directly responsible for the "reorganization" and handling the redundant officers, we cannot help but feel disappointed.</p>
<p>Reorganization is the implementation of the elite soldier principle, and the wise should be in positions of power. However, the 30th Army is taking this opportunity to "purify the army" and implement the so-called "first cadre, second cadre, third not cadre" policy. We, who are not cadres trained by the army commander himself in the first and second cadre classes, are of course unconditionally "redundant." Especially the medical personnel are suffering the most. Unless they are graduates of the 30th Army Nursing Training Class, even those with long experience and academic expertise are all asked to leave, and those who have not received formal training and have no clinical experience are promoted across ranks to recklessly treat "military" lives!</p>
<p>Once the reorganization is completed, the army rushes us to leave as if we are plagues. When we arrived in Zhengzhou, there was no place to report. After searching everywhere, we finally found the person in charge in a certain room in a hotel. It turned out that the responsible agency had not been formed in time. It was not until we came to Rongyang and were formed into the 25th Officer Corps of the Ministry of Military Affairs that our lives began to settle down. During those ten days in Zhengzhou, we had to put on a brave face to maintain the reputation and discipline of the army, and our pockets were emptied as a result. The most miserable were the redundant officers with families, whose wives and children suffered. In the end, some had to raise money everywhere and sell some broken things to pay for the lodging. Of course, the army also provided travel expenses, reportedly (question mark?) only for three days. When we received them, they had already been discounted by 20% for some unknown reason, totaling 5,760 yuan.</p>
<p>We are now living in Caoli, Rongyang, and the problem of food and lodging has been solved for now. The officers often come to give us lectures, focusing on military discipline, as if redundant officers are inherently restless. As for the mixed grains, we hear that the grain "source is unknown." We also seem to hear that the price of mixed grains (corn) and wheat is one to three. It is hard to believe that the country would make such small calculations on the redundant officers and buy mixed grains for us to eat. As for clothing, in this hot weather, we redundant officers are still wearing old cotton-padded jackets that we cannot take off, saying that the "source is unknown" as well? Don't you see those who once "saved the country through a roundabout way" have long put on khaki uniforms? We, who have always taken a straight path in the war, even though we are now redundant, the blood and sweat we shed for the country will not be discarded along with it, right? Now we want a set of coarse cloth summer uniforms to change into, but we can't even imagine it!</p>
<p>The unfairness in the army reorganization, and eating mixed grains and wearing cotton-padded clothes in the Officer Corps, how can this not leave a deep question mark in the hearts of the redundant officers: "Is this how reorganization is done?" We urge people across the country to pay attention to this "question mark," and we hope that those who are directly or indirectly in charge will act with conscience, based on the intentions of the highest authorities and the wishes of the people, to truly and responsibly handle this matter well. We also hope that various aspects will establish more counseling agencies to provide assistance and guidance to redundant officers, solve their difficulties, and quickly transfer or further educate us separately. Let us retire and no longer suffer or feel lost for the sake of livelihood and future.</p>

<h3>Anti-Smoking</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>No one dares to say that gentlemen have disappeared from Shanghai!</p>
<p>I remember in Hong Kong, Indian opium was placed in tin tubes that looked like toothpaste tubes, each tube costing five cents. The outer packaging was even more beautiful than toothpaste.</p>
<p>I remember in Chongqing, a star friend replied to me: We can find a "smoke" anywhere we go. As soon as we sit down in a teahouse, we don't even need to steep the tea a few times before we find a way out.</p>
<p>I can't help but admire the skills and tricks of opium addicts.</p>
<p>Some time ago, Shanghai vigorously arrested many opium offenders. Among them, the most attention-grabbing were three women: Yuan Meiyun, Xia Peizhen, and Zheng Bingru. We dare not say that this is an anti-smoking advertisement, but we hope it can be popularized. Many opium offenders do not need to have their names hidden. As for "someone speaking up" and then letting them go, that is absolutely unacceptable!</p>
<p>Today, there will definitely be another scene of burning opium and opium paraphernalia. This proves that there are still these odds and ends. When can we reach a point where there is "nothing to burn"?</p>
<h3>Nanjing in the Mist and Rain of the Six Dynasties</h3>
<p>— Fang Naiqing</p>
<p>Since the Three Kingdoms, Wu, Six Dynasties, Southern Tang, and early Ming dynasties established their capitals in Nanjing, it has become the cultural center of our country. During the peak periods of the Six Dynasties and the early Ming dynasty, the population inside and outside the city reached nearly one million. After that, it experienced wars and disasters. By the time the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom failed, the people had suffered greatly from the war, and the population sharply declined. Before 1927, the entire city had a population of only about 300,000. Until the summer of 1927, when the National Revolutionary Army's Northern Expedition was successful and the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the scale of the capital was roughly established. The country was well governed, the people celebrated their revival, and commerce thrived due to its proximity to Shanghai. The population surged, and by the winter of 1927, the population of Nanjing had increased to over 370,000. During the era of warlord rule, Nanjing gradually declined. Although the city was large, it became increasingly dilapidated. Fields were connected to markets, and vast lands were left barren. The main roads were often bumpy and uneven, and the back alleys were filled with stagnant water. The banks of the Qinhuai River were filled with singing and dancing, but they only served as entertainment for corrupt officials, unscrupulous soldiers, and the like, who came to have fun and then flaunt their power. The so-called elegance of the Six Dynasties had long disappeared, leaving nothing to admire. After North China was stabilized, Shenyang changed hands, and unification was successful, politics gradually became organized, and construction could be said to have begun. The urban area was undergoing large-scale construction, and public utilities were gradually being completed. Nanjing became increasingly prosperous. According to the population survey of Nanjing at the end of 1935, the population of the urban area of Nanjing had reached over 1,010,000.</p>
<p>Nanjing is an important transportation hub in our country, connecting the north, south, east, and west. Its superior natural environment is known to anyone with common sense, so there is no need to elaborate. From the time the National Government established its capital to the end of 1935, in this short period of eight and a half years, the government, even in the face of extreme difficulties of internal and external troubles, did not slacken its great aspiration to build a nation by first building a capital. As a result, construction progressed rapidly, and the city administration was improving day by day. New-style buildings and wide roads in the urban area were suitable for the requirements of a modern city and were praised by the world. Foreign envoys who were accustomed to the prosperity and splendor of urban life had changed their perception of Nanjing, no longer yearning for Beijing and despising Nanjing. They settled in Nanjing and sought housing and land. If there had been no Sino-Japanese War, the government's plan to build a greater Nanjing would have been realized long ago. The government's plan to build Nanjing included designating political, industrial, and residential areas, as well as the magnificent and peaceful gardens and zoos with various animals that a modern city should have, as well as museums that transcended ancient and modern times, and science museums that encompassed everything. It is said that the government's plan to build the political area originally intended to locate the National Government and the five Yuan in one place, with the National Government in the center and the five Yuan surrounding it, adjacent to the main roads. Opposite the Executive Yuan would be the sites of the various ministries, and near the political area would be the residential area for civil servants. With the government's offices concentrated in one place, administrative assessment could achieve rapid and effective results, and civil servants would not have to travel long distances, saving them time, money, and energy, and allowing them to devote themselves to their duties and strive for improvement. This move would undoubtedly have an impact on changing China's past decadent political climate. Unfortunately, the Japanese invaded, and the divine capital was lost, and this plan was also reduced to ashes. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, and people are singing triumphant songs and ascending the spring stage, once peace is realized, transportation is restored, and prices are stabilized, the day of rebuilding Nanjing will be the beginning of laying the foundation for the political area. It is not difficult to think of it in a positive way.</p>
<p>Nanjing is located in the southwest of Jiangsu, on the south bank of the Yangtze River, bordering Jurong to the east, looking towards Jiangpu to the west, connecting Gaoyou to the south, and facing Luhe to the north. It is bordered by Piaoshui to the southeast and Dangtu, Anhui to the southwest. By land, there are the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou railways, as well as the convenience of the Beijing-Hangzhou national highway; by water, there is the advantage of the Yangtze River's inland waterways, making transportation extremely convenient. Therefore, after Nanjing became the capital, the agricultural products of the counties under the former Jiangning Prefecture were easier to transport and sell, and their agricultural economic value also increased. The lives of farmers were also better than before. Not only that, but even the counties north of Nanjing benefited from it. However, although Nanjing is suitable for a city population of over one million, its commercial organization and habits are not yet in line with today's requirements, especially during the period of reconstruction and on the eve of the return of the capital. Taking April as an example, it is estimated that the government transported about 8,000 people back to the capital by air last month, and less than 50,000 people returned by land and water. The housing shortage in Nanjing remains, and the prices of goods and grain in Nanjing have been rising several times a day since mid-April, rising by one-third or one-half. As for the price of rice, the price of top-quality rice once fell to 21,000 yuan per stone in mid-April, but by the end of April, it had risen to 38,000 yuan per stone, and there was no market for it. The price of rice has a great impact on the Nanjing market. Once the price of rice rises, everything becomes expensive. The barber and bath industries have taken the opportunity to raise their prices, with black market barbers charging as much as 2,000 yuan per head. As a result, public educators who live on low salaries and soldiers who live on several thousand to ten thousand yuan have an increasingly difficult life and increasingly poor nutrition. We should know that although prices in Shanghai are high, they are fortunately flexible. Nanjing is not. Taking the Shanghai way of eating as an example, Shanghai has set meals for 600 or 500 yuan, Yangchun noodles for 150 yuan, and you can fill your stomach at a small food stall for 300 or 400 yuan. In Nanjing, a set meal costs nearly 1,000 yuan, at least 770 yuan, and a bowl of plain noodles costs 250 yuan. Nanjing is the capital, and people pay attention to appearances. There are very few small food stalls. An unfortunate small civil servant or soldier who arrives late and rashly goes to a restaurant, ordering only one dish, one clear soup, and two bowls of rice, will often be embarrassed on the spot because he cannot pay the 1,800 yuan bill and can only blush and curse. In fact, the bill is not unreasonable, and the merchants in Nanjing are not bad-hearted. The reason for the price increases in the stores is always the same: high rent, heavy taxes, high rice prices, high labor costs, or that Shanghai has already raised prices and the goods are expensive. The former makes people recall the low cost of living in Chongqing before 1943, and the latter makes people shudder at the crisis of Nanjing being adjacent to the speculative market of Shanghai. Therefore, when the citizens and journalists of Nanjing heard that the grain administration special commissioner was about to release grain, the Ministry of Social Affairs was about to set up canteens and dormitories in Beijing, and a certain ministry was about to run a cooperative, they could not help but be overjoyed and shout that there was a solution.</p>
<p>Nanjing people still preserve some of the slang of "incident" and "peace." Those who returned to the capital from the southwest and northwest have not forgotten the pain of the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and the hard-won victory. Some people continue to endure hardships and would rather suffer in a small room. Some people have forgotten the pain and only feel that the victory will bring unexpected wealth, which they do not dedicate to the country or use to help the refugees, but instead offer to the dancers on the volcano and the dance troupes, hot restaurants and tea rooms, and even the turtle slaves and the procuresses. As a result, the dance halls in Nanjing are becoming increasingly outrageous. When the lanterns are lit, the music starts, and the charming voices sing softly, those cosmopolitan, Guangming, Jingu, or several dance halls that are too small are really good-looking! They are really lively, and the liveliness is indescribable. The dancers and their partners are so crowded that they are like wooden poles, standing close to each other, making it pitifully difficult to move an inch. It would be more appropriate to call it a matchbox than a dance hall. No wonder the Senate wants to loudly call for a ban. The price of tea and other things in Nanjing dance halls is half that of Shanghai. This thing is cheaper than Shanghai, so it is enjoyed by both the refined and the vulgar, and business is particularly good.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Nanjing Municipal Senate, it suddenly makes people feel that the future of democracy is bright. The Nanjing Municipal Provisional Senate fired several cannons during its meetings: The first cannon drove away a "problem representative," but unfortunately, there was little follow-up. The second cannon cut the price of public bus tickets in half. (The original price was 200 yuan, which was doubled after government approval, but now, due to the opposition of the Senate, the original price is still maintained.) The citizens have a high opinion of the "ability" of the senators and the "wisdom" of the government in respecting public opinion. The third cannon aimed at the 70,000 stones of rice controlled by the grain administration special commissioner, demanding that the special commissioner release it for sale to help the poor, and it has already hit the target. The citizens of Nanjing said: "This is what the days of being a member are like. We ordinary people now understand democracy. In the future, we will demand a democracy that can be spoken of and done. If you speak the truth and sell fake leaves, then you are a democratic swindler; we will hang him." At this time, the sound of planes roared in the sky, and a large number of National Assembly representatives and party planes were arriving.</p>
<p>As the return to the capital was coming to an end, Special Envoy Marshall and Mr. Hoover arrived in Beijing one after another, followed by Chairman Chiang, who won the title of national savior for leading the eight-year Anti-Japanese War. Representatives of the Communist Party, such as Mr. Zhou Enlai, also arrived in Nanjing. That day (May 5) at 4:20 p.m., Chairman Chiang, in order to thank former US President Hoover, who traveled across the ocean and worked tirelessly to benefit the disaster victims, personally accompanied Special Envoy Marshall and Minister Wang Shijie to see Hoover off, and the four of them took a photo together before Hoover left. On this photo with a great human loving smile, we journalists smiled for the first time in Nanjing for the sake of a group of disaster victims being rescued.</p>
<h3>The Handsome Man Who Won the Academy Award, Ray Milland</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>Ray Milland, the handsome man who won the 1945 Academy Award, is now even more famous in Hollywood than before. Among the fans, there are even infatuated girls who are in love with him and write letters to pursue him.</p>
<p>(1) The Ideal Girl of the Times</p>
<p>Recently, Ray Milland criticized women. According to him, the kind of girl that a 1946-style man needs is a typical woman, especially one who is smart and dresses appropriately. Girls who attend "parties" must be humorous and must never monopolize the attention of the public. She can use storytelling and speaking skills to make people in the group cheer all night, but when she gets home, she returns to her original appearance.</p>
<p>(2) Opposes Women Drinking Heavily</p>
<p>Ray Milland won the Academy Award for starring in "The Lost Weekend." He opposes women who like to drink alcohol. In this film, he played a drunkard, so he acted exceptionally well. He believes that women occasionally drinking alcohol is not reprehensible, but it is not appropriate for those who drink without knowing when to stop. Because women are more likely to talk when they drink too much, and their faces are especially ugly at this time. Especially since women are more easily stimulated than men and have richer emotions, they will cause trouble when they cannot control their emotions.</p>
<p>(3) Winning the Golden Award Was Unexpected</p>
<p>When he was filming "The Lost Weekend," he did not expect it to be so successful, so winning the Golden Award was unexpected. Perhaps playing a drunkard would move the general unfortunate drunkards. Ray Milland has been famous in Hollywood for thirteen years, and now he has finished his fifteenth film. He has a good tolerance for alcohol. When he walks into a hotel and orders ginger wine and bitters, the waiter will stare at him. If he is drinking alcohol, even some fans are a little uneasy. People hope that he will walk into the dining room with a face that is not red, so he always drinks ginger wine and bitters.</p>
<p>(4) Extremely Good Relationship Between Husband and Wife</p>
<p>His success in recent years, in addition to winning awards, another test is that the number of people calling and telegraphing him is gradually increasing. But he believes that other than the whole world worshiping the award winner, there is basically no difference between himself and before. There are many infatuated girls among the fans who are pursuing him, but he and his wife have a very good relationship. His six-year-old child often thinks of him as a hero because he recently saw him appear in a western film. Currently, his only wish is to take a vacation after completing his seven-year contract to go fishing, diving, and skiing in the wild. In the next few months, he plans to take his wife and daughter on a vacation trip to South America. When he returns to Hollywood, he may be able to try out his newly built forty-foot-long fishing boat.</p>
<h3>Love and Money</h3>
<p>— Cao Zuohan</p>
<p>The prerequisite for love is money, not true love and goodwill.</p>
<p>I am still a young man who does not know the taste of sorrow, so in an accidental moment, I was controlled by nature and fell into the net of romance. After a dizzy spell and a few dreams, I came to this conclusion. The pain that the soul endures is so cruel, and the conclusion is so distorted.</p>
<p>Five years ago, when I was teaching, I was loved by a fake girl. People's hearts are made of flesh, so after more than half a year of her pursuit, I also unconsciously fell in love with her. After more than two years of correspondence, she got married. At that time, I was unemployed, and the two of us separated silently without saying a word. She is now a mother, and it is said that she still misses me very much.</p>
<p>I thought that economic power might have a better influence on the mood of professional women, so I soon met another professional woman. This time, it was through an introduction, and I took the initiative because I wanted to understand the true meaning of love through experimentation.</p>
<p>The process went very well, and we got engaged last year.</p>
<p>After the engagement, an old friend I hadn't seen for many years came to see me. During the casual conversation, we talked about the previous separation. He asked me the reason.</p>
<p>"There is no reason. This cannot be considered a broken love. She didn't want to throw me away, and I didn't want to throw her away, but we had to separate, and we separated silently." I thought about it again and added, "If I had to find a reason, it was probably because I was poor. Kisses can't fill you up, so it was reasonable for her to leave me."</p>
<p>Fate played a joke on me. She was right, and I was not wrong either.</p>
<p>Recently, I resigned voluntarily because I was dissatisfied with the supervisor's style. Her environment remained the same, but her attitude towards me was gradually changing. I understood very clearly.</p>
<p>Could it really be that the prerequisite for love is money, not true love and goodwill? I can't stand this joke. People are always emotional animals. Fortunately, I have a job again recently, but I have to re-evaluate the true value of women. Here, I would like to venture to advise that before your career is successful, you should execute love.</p>
<h3>Church, Satire, Answer</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>This church is Moore Church, located at the intersection of Xizang Road and Hankou Road. It is surrounded by dance halls, theaters, coffee shops, and many street girls.</p>
<p>I don't know whether its spire architecture satirizes the surrounding environment, or whether the sounds and colors of the surrounding environment satirize it.</p>
<h3>We Don't Want to "Die Unjustly"</h3>
<p>— Yu Qian</p>
<p>The road is like a tiger's mouth, and you can't walk in the middle. Now in Shanghai, you really have to be careful every moment!</p>
<p>A person who comes to Shanghai for the first time is suddenly "Bang!" by a "cannon" from behind, instinctively stopping and turning around. At that moment, a speeding ten-wheeled truck arrives, and another person who "died unjustly" is added to the underworld.</p>
<p>This is an imaginary picture. Do you say it is impossible?</p>
<p>Mayor, Director: Instead of needing those traffic patrol cars equipped with amplifiers, driving around on the road and shouting "Be careful when crossing the road," we would rather ban those Jeeps and ten-wheeled trucks that are ramming around in the city, and various military vehicles that have no need to drive in the city!</p>

<h3>A Certain Tycoon: Four Changes in Complexion</h3>
<p>— By Feng Yi</p>
<p>The cotton yarn magnate, Rong Desheng, since being "released" by the bandits and returning, the inside story is complex, and it is still difficult to "reveal everything." Although the Rong family tells people that this abduction was purely "unconditional," according to those familiar with the inside story: this is like "a mute eating bitter herbs," having unspeakable suffering.</p>
<p>The police department had put in a lot of effort for the "Tycoon's" affair, and now although Rong has returned, they still want to investigate the ins and outs, fearing that this trend will grow, increasing the danger of "people fear becoming famous, pigs fear becoming fat."</p>
<p>Some people say: The Rong family's difficulty is that it is difficult to be a person. Three bandits urgently want money, the police department urgently wants people, the Rong family wants... Is the present problem not about "money gone, person safe"? But rather that the police department wants to find out something, so the bandits are gone and the police are here, and the Rong family still has unspeakable suffering.</p>
<p>Some people say: In this day and age, those without money "want to live" by staging big strikes and causing trouble at the Social Affairs Bureau. But those with money are also causing a commotion, even disturbing the peace, in order to "want to live." Although the two "commotions" are different in form, their meaning is the same. Both "want to live" and "stir up" many things.</p>
<p>The authorities are determined to crack down on manipulating rice prices, and the central government has specially dispatched a high-ranking official to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate. The news is urgent. The rice merchants initially thought that the officialdom's actions would be nothing after a few perfunctory gestures, but unexpectedly this time it was a real deal. Only then were they shocked. A certain rice merchant tycoon was once interrogated by the central government official, who first asked, "Who exactly are the manipulators?" The face of the tycoon turned "red," and he stared blankly, unable to answer. The official then pressed him, "Who do you say it is?" Seeing the situation was tight, the tycoon's face "changed a second time," turning from red to "white," but he still remained tight-lipped, not daring to speak. The official was very angry at this point, "If you don't speak, I'll execute you!" Although the tycoon was confident, upon hearing talk of execution, he ultimately valued his life more than money. At this point, he could not help but feel anxious, and his face "changed a third time," turning from white to "green." The official then took out a handwritten instruction from the chairman, indicating that the matter had reached a final juncture. After reading it, the tycoon only felt stars popping up before his eyes, and his face could not help but "change a fourth time," turning from green to "black." The scene at the time, as described by those present, was: "The official urgently gave the order, shouting three times, and the tycoon was sweating profusely, his face changing four times."</p>
<p>Collection of Three-Word and Two-Word Sayings</p>
<h3>To Die of Old Age is Not to Be a Thief</h3>
<p>— By Wuling Ren</p>
<p>Yuan Meiyun's drug use and the city government being accused of election fraud - I dare to say that more people will be concerned about the former than the latter. It is gratifying that the general public is quite able to "value women's rights," but it is sad that people are indifferent to "democracy."</p>
<p>It was expected that Yuan Lüdeng would at most be sentenced to life imprisonment. Yuan is one of the "three elders" in Shanghai. To die of "old age" is not to be considered a thief.</p>
<p>DDT packaged in beer bottles is already flooding the market, but according to reports: the United States has recently developed a new type of DDT soap, which can kill lice eggs when washing clothes, remove germs when used for bathing, and prevent mosquitoes from biting. I have inquired in the market, and Shanghai does not yet have this product, but I believe that it will soon be "shipped in large quantities," and stores and advertisements will be full of it.</p>
<p>After a national crisis, difficulties loom." The character "困" [difficult] contains the character "木" [wood] in the middle, clearly saying that the people are like Jesus nailed to the cross.</p>
<p>Recently, the mayor summoned the heads of various industry unions to the Queen's Theatre to give instructions, saying that in six months, everyone would be in danger of unemployment. Some say that the character "个" [ge, unit] in the phrase "six months" can be omitted.</p>
<p>Lin Bosheng, upon hearing his death sentence, said he was willing to waive the right to appeal and expressed his gratitude to the presiding judge. Presumably, Lin Bosheng had also realized that his sins were too deep, and that even "a hundred lives" would not be enough to atone for them.</p>
<h3>Living Bodhisattva, and So On</h3>
<p>— By Sima Huan</p>
<p>Yesterday, I met an old woman who had just fled from northern Jiangsu. She told me that in the various counties in northern Jiangsu occupied by the Communist army, all the large and small temples have posters with these four lines:</p>
<p>Mud Bodhisattvas fear rain</p>
<p>Paper Bodhisattvas fear wind</p>
<p>If you want to worship a living Bodhisattva</p>
<p>Then worship Mao Zedong</p>
