<h3 id="c1">討論改組國府委會　五人小組人選決定　政府中共各二人司徒雷登任主席　不牽涉軍事及政院問題 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕關於國府委會改組問題，商談漸見端倪，據悉，五人小組人選已決定，政府方面二人爲中央黨部秘書長吳鐵城、內長張勵生，共產黨二人爲周恩來，董必武，美方爲司徒雷登大使，馬特使不參加。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕政府頃已同意馬司兩使建議改組國民政府委員會一事，並決定成立五人小組，進行商討，待有所成就後，即交政協綜合小組研討關於改組政府諸問題。此項小組會議，早於馬使在　時即曾提出，惟未獲主席同意，旣經同意後，雙方廿九日即進行研討人選問題，政府方面決定爲吳鐵城，張勵生，惟未經主席最後核定，故若干記者得悉此項消息後，均慎重未即發表。頃據可靠消息，主席已同意兩氏馬代表，並召兩氏卅日赴牯，將即將開始之小組會議內容慎重探討，並定九月二人返京，該項會議將於三日啟幕。該會由司使任主席，其討論議題，據共產黨表示，約爲下列數點：（一）國府委員會名額之分配，（二）變更和平建國網領三分之一否決權之研討。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕政協府方面代表，廿九日晚六時曾就　嶺路吳秘書長公館舉行會談、計到張厲生，邵力子，陳誠，孫科，雷震，吳鐵城六人。陳立夫因病，王世杰在法未出席，據聞，談話主要中心，即就五人小組會議之出席人選及　題加以研究，至七時許即散。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿九日電〕五人小組專門討論國府委負會改組事宜，絕對不牽涉軍事問題及行政院問題。先由政府與中共雙方交換意見。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿九日電〕據悉：延安要求之否決權，並非單純的大多數，而係三分之二票數，聞司徒大使頗覺樂觀，認爲此等手續細則，慈善人士當可解決之。一　國府委員會成立，或可使戰事告終，並使馬歇爾特使及其三人委員會之國共雙方委負，得以進行整編軍隊及恢復交通工作。</p>
<p>司使訪宋院長</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕司徒大使廿九日上午九時三刻曾赴金陵神學院，演講宗教教義，達半小時。十時一刻傳顧問涇波往邀，同赴行政院拜會宋院長，至十一時半辭出，作大使　任後首次正式拜會。十一時四十分往訪馬特使，談一刻鐘返使館。國府參軍皮宗敢，於十二時訪司使，談一小時許，內容曾非正式涉及政治問題。下午四時馬市長超俊訪司使，四時半農林部長周詒春往訪，七時司使往訪馬特使，並在其行館同進晚餐，餐後觀電影。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據可靠方面息：國府印籌局近奉最高當局令，限於十月十日前製就忠勤勛章五千枚，以便於本年雙十節授予全國陸海空軍各有功國家人員，該項勛章係銀質鍍金，代表受勛者之崇高榮譽。</p>

<p>〔路透社南京廿九日電〕加拿大大使歐德倫少將，廿九日發表聲明否認曾應馬特使之請，向蔣主席有所解釋之說，據謂：「若余曾說過或做過該一報告中所述之事之一部份，加拿大政府即將認余越權，而召我返國」。「余若有政治活動，當不在國民黨，亦不在共產黨，而在中國之老百姓。中國之命運，握在蔣主席，周恩來，馬歇爾，司徒雷登諸人之手中，余對此諸公之才幹及忍耐心，旣了解而欽佩，復具有重大之信任，但余並不在彼等之圈子內。余之地位，與大衆相同，不過在旁聽席上第一排中佔一小位而已。我可以鼓掌，事實上我亦曾經鼓掌，但我必不可步至台上，余對中國羣衆，茍無欽佩愛慕之意，對若干領導人物，苟無深刻友誼，則余當早已束裝返國矣。余之留此者，因余相信，中國之發展，對於整個世界包括加拿大在內，均有重大之影響故也。其先，歐德倫並謂：余之任務，等於一在朋友之立塲上，從事研究之旁觀者，余與中國各派領袖，雖有密切私交，但余不擬參加中國政治，亦無參加之權。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿九日電〕據路透社南京消息稱：英首相艾德禮私人駐華代表魏亞特，已否認中國報載英國將參加中國政府與共產黨之新和平談判說。</p>

<h3 id="c4">召開國民大會　共黨仍在反對 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿八日電〕中共發言人王炳南稱：蔣主席若不先成立聯合政府，而於十一月十二日召開國民大會，中共將在延安召集中共控制區內各領袖，討論第二步行動。延安反對由單方面召開國民大會，通過憲法，並認此舉爲政府意欲在政治上使國家分裂。直到現在，共產區內各種政治機構均屬地方政府，因我人希望統一聯合，故並未成立中央政府。若政府提議在戰事未停止前召開國民大會，摒棄中共，我人已準備召集所有邊區政府會議，作爲答覆。外傳政府若堅持於和平談判及改組政府等主要問題解決前召開國民大會，則延安將考慮另建中共中央政府，王氏所言足以證明此說。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕中央銀行經濟顧問楊沃德，廿九日晨訪馬特使，聞就中國經濟前途及其趨勢有所論及。楊氏在華十六年，對我國經濟問題有卓越之見解，並著有專文多件，不日將撓請馬使評閱。又楊氏因患病，將赴加州休養，半年後再行來華，訪馬使係表辭行之意。</p>

<p>〔中央社徐州廿九日電〕軍息，蘇北國軍廿九日下午二時進駐宿遷縣城，共軍向東北潰竄中。</p>
<p>〔本報泰縣廿九日電〕犯白米鎭共軍，確曾一度進入市區，旋經國軍反擊，業已退出，刻戰事仍在該鎭附近進行中。曲塘海安間來犯共軍，經國軍迎擊，紛紛潰退，曲海公路亦由當局修復，惟姜曲公路之交通，因受共軍破壞，暫告停頓。</p>
<p>〔本報江都廿九日電〕揚州仙女廟當面共軍，今日小規模出動騷擾，此或爲大規模攻勢之前奏。又邵伯湖西南地區，近亦時有共軍活動。據邵伯喬墅等地逃出之難民稱：共軍現在各該地區大肆屠殺，所謂「親政府」人民婦孺，均難倖免，劉家莊一地即達三百餘人，其殺人方法，令人髮指，某人被捕後，被推入糞坑，浸約半小時，將其提出，更於烈日之下並令看棉衣，如此者再，受刑者在喊絕命，共軍以此爲樂</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿九日電〕關係軍事當局談，熱河情勢相當嚴重，承德之執行小組與軍調部失却聯絡，市內電源雖已被共軍自行破壞，但並不影饗小組利用乾電池之電機，故判斷此小組是否已有問題，美方爲此昨提議派機往承德聯絡，共方謂因情勢嚴重，不能保證飛機之安全，但美方終於昨日派出一機，有政府人員同行，迄今晚六時，尚未聞歸來。軍調部美方會詢及共軍何故破壞承德之電源，共方答稱，不僅此，承德之所有，均將予以破壞。據悉承德城內，原有共軍三個團，近刻則不詳，一部人謂國軍收復承德不難，然熱河第二重點赤峯之命運，亦在未定中。共產黨人今以半玩笑情態稱，馬帥引爲傑作之赤峯間題，解決於軍調部之始，而今日之赤峯間題，則可能爲軍調部送終。鄭洞國與東北政委會委員達王廿七日均到朝陽。隨軍事進展，蒙旗政治，亦將有顯著開展。達王並將赴平泉一行。錦州之鐵路局長萬國賓，廿八日亦到凌源策劃督飭隨軍趕修　　路、及平泉至葉柏　赤峯綫，錦　路已修至凌源西之水泉，最近可修至平泉，葉赤綫短期亦可修復。</p>

<p>〔中央社紐約廿七日電〕紐約時報本日著論，駁斥周恩來廿六日之聲明，指責中國共產黨發動宣傳戰，强迫美國自華撤退。該報社論，以「宣傳武器在中國」爲標題稱：東北中共軍隊對國軍之新攻勢，及其他若干區城之加緊戰鬥，不必即　中國已捲入全面內戰，此備乃共產黨强迫吾人自華撤退之運動之一部份，所有共產黨發言人皆强調此點，延安目前之政策，殆以此爲其主要目標。</p>
<p>任何人均可指出所謂「和平陣綫」之平行行動，美國之堅定性，在歐洲正四處受到侵略戰術之測騐，吾人在該處之利益，已發生危險，共產黨在中國亦言和平且累積若干反和平之障碍，亦如其在巴黎之所爲。周恩來在南京小心翼翼以保持其會談中之地位，且未關閉進一步談判之門，而將談判擱淺之主要責任，諉過於美國，周氏聲言若吾人停止將南太平洋剩餘物資售與中國，並撤退吾人之軍隊及終止對中國政府之支持，則和平談判，可能根據較爲合理之基礎而重開。周氏所謂「合理」者，乃指延安地位之加强，及南京地位之無限削弱。　自對日戰事結束以後，中國戰火不時閃耀，皆與共產黨在政治戰綫上之進展有關，無論何時，若共產黨一如其在東北之遭受阻止，則戰事即可暫時平靜，共產當在蘇北之重新進攻及圍攻大同，均爲其另一政治進展之反應，最近數月，延安對莫斯科更爲接近，且隨處模倣蘇聯之政策，目前中國共產黨正以最厲害之宣傳武器，指向美國此蓋彰彰明甚者也。</p>

<h3 id="c20">普通歲出追加預算　立法院昨日例會通過　樓桐蓀報告檢討經濟政策結論 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕立法院於廿九日上午九時舉行三〇六次例會，出席委員卅一人，孫院長主席，首由樓桐蓀報告該院九人委會工作槪况（見後）後，討論提案，計通過各案如次：（一）資源委員會糾織法草案，（二）修正勛章條例第六條，（三）東南鼠疫防治處組織條例草案，（四）修改司法院組織法內主計部份條文，（五）特種渦份利很稅法草案修正通過。（六）中巴文化專約，（七）通過民國卅四年度國家普通歲出江蘇，安徽，浙江，福建，廣東，廣西，湖南，湖北，山東，四川，西康，甘肅，察哈爾，河南等省及重慶，南京，北平，上海等十八省市追加預算書。</p>
<p>財經政策</p>
<p>樓桐蓀之報告略稱：該工作方式分開會討論，分組研究，分別訪查三種，爲時兩月，開會十次，其中六次並曾分別請財政·經濟。糧食。交通各部，行總，四聯總處，中央銀行等負責人到會說明，該會並對以後工作動向，檢討如下：（一）政府對財政經濟金融問題，缺乏統一性政策，制度散漫，各主管機關各自爲政，缺乏聯緊。（二）權不在機關中，推行有權，却不必負責。（三）政府處理財政金融辦法，太不溫和如此次外匯調整，比例太大，此種措施，或毀損政府信用，或刺激市塲變動，實均欠考慮。（四）應側重政策機構和人事三方面注意研究。結論爲：（一）我們的看法爲經濟第一，行政當局看法爲財政第一（二）我們的對象是人民生活，國民經濟第一，行政當局的對象是謀取國家統一，而迫切解決之兩三件事。所以我們是顧到整個財政經濟政治軍事，使政治經濟正常化血不妨礙財政軍事。</p>
<p>兩項調查</p>
<p>旋田李慶應報告，（甲）調查糙食部本年征借糧食數量，及軍糧配額事實，認爲糧食部無一整個的糧食政策，以致對消費及生產者雙方利益，朱能全船　到，而有害於國計民生，糧部應趕快設法，使後方豐收之糧食運濟需要地區，並平抑銷區市價，減輕人民負担。（乙）關於經濟部接收處理敵偽物資，調查報告意見如次：（一）冀熱察區接收廠鑛之處理情形，其仍田辦公處保管運用者，計佔全部廠鑛百分之七十以上，且各廠鑛並未附說「有物資」。（二）已接收之工廠有三三四單位，而未開工者達二百以上。（三）已復工之廠鑛營業狀况甚佳，然僅謂「足自給而有餘」，殊屬不解。（二）蘇浙皖區，（一）對皖區情形無詳細報告。（二）在滬接收之廠鑛會社及各附屬單位等，亦未詳列種類及數字。（三）已復工工廠一七六單位，且均係紡織工廠，其餘是否均在停工狀態中。（四）發還之工廠物資數字不詳。（五）封存物養之處理辦法，亦不知售價，亦不知是否已解國庫。（三）湘鄂　區，（一）據該特派員報告，物資數量與原始淸册不符。（二）對湘區接收廠鑛單位，無詳細數字。（四）粵桂閩區，對物資價値及倉庫物資，均未述及。。台灣區，據該區報告，資產應有台幣八區六億，現僅三十三億。</p>
<p>外匯會率</p>
<p>本會對於中央銀行最近提高外匯率意見，常前經濟險象造因甚多由來已久，經長期互相激盪，累積而形成挽救之道，千頭萬緒，惟一主要辦法，須先確定一　長期經濟應設政策。由此而定一全　計劃，然後依照計劃，定一套實施辯　，按步就　，分頭並進，由政　眞社會，共同努力推動，庶幾可免經浩刦，絕非一枝平節之臨時救濟方法，可能　效，須知財政金融，係整個經濟生活之一環，財政措施金融活動，須配合整個經濟建設政策後，始可收預期效果，若　融活動不配合財政措施，甚至與經濟政策無多大關係，則此種金融活動，僅有利於少數人，而不能解救大多數工商業之厄運，更難解救全社會之經濟危機。年來行政負責當局，似僅注意金融活動，無形中領導全國上下，集中資財於黃金美鈔之買賣，而忽視關係國計民生之　個經濟建設，致社會經濟現象，愈趨愈下，外匯管制原極重要，應按市塲之供需，隨時定價控制，始有利於工商，若商定一個匯率歷數月而不變，偶而一變，變動之匯率文相　甚鉅，徒使擁有大量外匯及囤積大量出口物資之商人暴得鉅利。至於眞正生產者，則受益甚少，此次外匯率驟然提高百分之六十以上，固屬有利於工商業，而法幣對外價値亦因之而貶低百分之六十有奇，物價受刺激上漲，影響民生至鉅，本會同人認爲此次提高外匯率，事前考慮似欠周詳，甚望事後對於全盤補救辦法趕快努力推動，以免社會經濟情况日趨險惡。」</p>

亦似不少，然較之漢唐間譯經之規模，大有遜色。且以近代各國哲學、文藝、社會科學、自然科學，以及史籍地誌之繁多，萬倍於釋典之量，固不必一一迻譯，然必期按世界潮流及中國所需，整理重編，使國人不復仍處蒙眛之中，而能享受獲得人類已有知識之利益，則學人固責無旁貸。無論中國學術，西洋學術，似乎在近期，中國至少應有如十八世紀法國狄岱麓學典及一個半世紀中曾出十四版之大英百科全書一部，以爲知識上　貧與普及之食糧。大抵中國書不便檢讀，而工具書又過於枯燥，國人有志而竭力從事者，雖大有人在，但均以編纂及出版上乏力而止。今李石曾氏主持有年之世界學典中文版，其四庫全書學典一册（楊家駱著），約二百餘萬字，已於此復員期中，克服大力物力的艱難而即可出版，餘册亦將付印，誠可謂爲文化復員中一大事業。允望主編者和出版者，均能繼續工作，以最大之努力，使中西學術各册，皆能逐漸出齊，陳列於吾人之前。　　此次戰爭中，文物之喪失，最難　償。雖羣述中亦有　書之輩，如近頃中央圖書館所接收者，即達百餘萬册，然以較散佚之數，則難相計量。淸乾隆時，纂四庫全書，二百年中，績修之呼聲屢起，而皆未成事實。惟日人在平所設東方文化總委員會，反會事於此。猶憶本年三月二中全會時，李石曾氏曾提議纂修中華全書，吳稚暉王亮疇諸氏均爲聯署，決議交國府辦理。提案的原議，大致由縣市而省，由各省而全國，編校各類原著，輯佚書·方志、年鑑、文存、圖徽等，更從而編纂分屬四部的全國性岡書，以及編輯校訂影印一切流傳於國外之中國圖書文物，以成燦爛　寓的「中華全書」。聞最近李氏赴歷山，亦曾擬議及此，主席深表贊許。世界學典中先出四庫全書學典，意即在提供編纂中華全書之技術，以促成此運動。國內潛居治學之士，所在多有，往往因消息不通，所致力者，或互相重複。政府於文化復員中，誠宜網羅此輩，共成斯業，以利中國文化之楚設與宣揚。

<p>美英蘇法外長攜顧問　集法外部開始會談　巴爾幹局勢亦在討論之列　　〔本報綜合消息〕據倫敦廿九日廣播：今日四强外長會議開會時，貝爾納斯首先蒞臨，貝文第二，莫洛托夫最遲。會議原擬在歷史性之　室中舉行，後經皮杜爾堅持，改在總理私人辦公室舉行。據法方意見，此種親切之環境，最有利於會議之進行。莫洛托夫之顧問爲維辛斯基與古賽夫，貝文之臘問爲麥克尼爾興傑勃，貝爾納斯之顧問爲范登堡與康納利，皮杜爾之顧問爲梅維葉。　　據路透社倫敦訊：四强外長今日下午四時在巴黎法國外交部開會，最近東歐國家之反對希臘，當爲恢復四强接觸之迫切原因之一。南斯拉夫之召回駐希大使、蘇聯之抗議希有　報紙之反蘇，烏克關之向安理會提出控訴，以及蘇駐希大使之返國，均爲反對希臘政府之各種表示。此等行動，較西方國家之反對南斯拉夫尤爲嚴重。觀察家認爲其目的在自美國奪向巴爾幹外交戰之主動優勢，以示東歐國家之反對希臘於目前環境下即舉行公民投票。復次，此次外畏會議，目的在統一四强對若干和約修正案之態度，而加速和會工作之進行。此事之發起者貝文外相，業已於廿八日下午四時十五分自倫敦起飛，於五時五十五分抵達巴黎。四强立塲之一致，巳於巴爾幹經濟委會中，英美法會同蘇聯反對漢代表所提修正案一點可以見之。　　據法國新聞社倫教消息，英外交部曾暗示外長會議除討論和會工作以外，其他問題亦將加以討論。貝文外相昨與土駐英大使會晤，因此一般人咸認爲修改蒙特婁公約問題亦爲外長會議課題之一。此次會議之主要目的，乃在決定四強對於和會其餘十七國代表所提出和約草案修正案之態度，至於已經各委會所通過之修正案，亦須決定是否加以接受。四强或任命發言人一人向和會發表演說，爲其見解有所辯護，良以此舉足以節省時間及加緊和會工作故也。和會對義委會討論　法義邊界問題　澳代表修正案否決　　據聯合社訊：義大利政治領土委會廿九日開會時，澳代表提議設立調查委會，協助調整關於法義邊境爭執之情報，當與蘇聯代表展開又一次熱烈辯論後，以十三票對六票否決。美·英·蘇·法均投反對票，澳洲·巴西·比利時·希臘·荷蘭及南非則表贊成，紐西籣棄權。當討論之際，波蘭代表韋尼威茲　請各代表捐棄瑣層之爭，而進行工作，並提醒各代表彼等曾以一個月之時間，討論九十二頁草約之六頁牛，全部草約必須經過三小組委會及全體大會通過，然後提交四外長會議。「吾人乃在準備和平，並非戰爭—原子戰爭，如若十代表所想像者」云。審議　軍事　條欵　　據巴黎廿九日廣播：軍事委會今日審查對義和約內之陸海空軍事條款，第卅九條毫無修正之必要，捷克代表提議討論第四十條，經紐捷法美等代表依次辯論後，又獲通過。隨後議及「義大利在可以涉及法南國土之地點，應拆毀及不得建築一切永久性砲壘」之條文。巴西代表提議，可補充新修正字句，此條應加「但單爲國防計，得在邊界廿公里內保存或建築之」。法代表買德魯謂，法國遵守四强所採決議，巴西修正意見，實已包括於第四十條丙，義大利根據此一條文，已可有此防禦國土之權利矣。南斯拉夫代表對此表示附議，巴西代表乃撤回其修正要求，第四十條終又獲得通過。會議於十二時一刻休止對保和約序文　第二部份通過　　據法國新聞社訊：對保加利亞政治及領土委會廿九日開會，討論對保和約序文，澳代表提出修正案，主張在序文中規定「依照公正原則」一語。南斯拉夫代表團長加台爾琪表示異議，並稱「澳洲代表團之所爲，一如此輩寗爲歐洲野蠻人殉難之傳教士，此誠令人不解。此項修正案足使若干强國對於事事必顧問之。」紐西蘭代表團長的但表示反對，請主席行使職權，重行討論澳洲所提修正案。至此，蘇代表自座中躍起，聲稱：「約但所言未免悔辱若干代表團，澳代表團於本日午後開會之初，即曾浪費時間矣。「大會最後將和約序文並澳洲所提修正案付諸表決，以十二票對一票通過，南斯拉夫投反對票·至終此項修正第二部份，期待日後討論。猶太恐怖分子　謀刺具文說　英法當局謠　　〔合衆社巴黎廿九日電〕法國警察當局頃否認關於發現猶太恐怖份子同謀行刺英外相貝文之報告。英代表團方面亦謂，此項謠言荒謬可笑。法警察當局稱，四强代表自利會開會以來，即有法國特別衛士隨從保護。巴爾幹委員會　　討論南非修正案　蘇代表反覆駁　　　據巴黎廿九日廣播：巴爾幹委員會今日開會時，烏克蘭代表起立反對南非之修正建議，謂南非所提建議之第一部份，目的在將羅馬尼亞聯緊於世界市塲之物價潮流，此則太不公正之事，南斯拉夫代表意見相同。英代表力爲南非修正案辯護，美代表認爲賠償應由前敵國負担，而不應由盟國人民分担一節，乃屬原則問題。然南代表仍繼續堅持其立塲，反　辯駁。　　據巴黎廿九日廣播：蘇聯代表古賽夫認爲對巴爾幹之修正案，實爲不堪接受者。渠指出物價一事，各國高低不同，可因種種原因發生波動，故物價問題不應預先規定於草約之內。關於此點，應任羅馬尼亞政府自己組織其經濟局面。南非所提修正建議，將使外國牽入羅馬尼亞之內政問題，致令羅馬尼亞之賠償發生附加之困難。法代表史篤巴里欲繼起發言，但遭主席之阻止，　主席提議於明最十時再繼續開會故也。按明日議程，將包括南非修正建設之繼續討論事項。八國入會申請引起激辯　安理會未獲協議　烏克蘭控訴案暫緩討論　　〔本報綜合消息〕本屆聯合國安理會廿八日於紐約開會。據路透社訊，會議一開始，荷蘭外長克里芬斯即起立發言，主張駁回烏克蘭對希臘之控訴，克氏指烏克蘭未能提出充分證據，其申訴純爲無理取鬧，意在麻煩他國，並曰，安理會應設法保護其尊嚴，吾人若使其接受一切無充分理由之申訴，則勢必將有損聯合國機構之利益。英代表賈德幹亦繼起發言，謂任何國欲提控訴，必須有充分而主要之證據。至此，蘇聯代表葛羅米柯即起立反駁，謂在未曾詳細討論該案以前，何以知其無充分之理由？安理會未加考慮即予拒絕，實屬有損　嚴。焉知烏克籣代表於安理會討論該案時未能提出更詳細之證據？聯合王國想已因烏克蘭之控訴而窘不可言，苟該案未曾牽涉聯合王國，買德幹君恐早子贊成矣。如此一塲激辯，結果爭持難下，至此，主席波籣代表期琪即建議將此事延緩至會員問題之討論告一段落後再爲計議，此項建議立即爲各代表所接受，乃即開始討論新會員申請入會之問題。按此次　　入會者原共九國，但暹羅政府因與法國之領土糾紛未曾解決，自請暫緩加入，至此乃只餘八國。美國代表的翰生曾建議，將該案併爲一集團聲請案，准八國全部加入，不必論及各國之功過，此議巴西，墨西哥，中國，埃及等國俱表贊同，但蘇聯及澳洲則表示反對。蘇代表葛羅米柯主張每一申請應個別處置，澳代表赫斯魯克亦認爲就手續問題論，似不應集團處置，而常作個別之考慮。至此，美代表乃撤回其建議，決定於廿九日會中對八國申請作個別之討論。　　廿九日上午十時半，繼續開會辯論。據合衆社電，會議情形似可能又引起蘇聯集團與英美集團閱之互用否決權。但太會亦可能接受法國之建議，即主張除通過瑞典，欲島及阿富汗加入外，其餘阿爾巴尼亞，愛爾蘭，外的但　外蒙古，及葡萄牙五國，且暫勿討論，俠一年後再議。但　代我葛羅米柯似仍企圖着阿爾巴尼亞先予通過。美國代表團發言人廿九日晨表示，如蘇聯定欲堅持，則美國可能運用否決權，反對阿爾巴尼亞及外蒙古入會。希公民投票期近　各方預測保王黨可獲勝　　左右兩翼陣綫攤牌此其時　　　〔聯合社雅典廿九日電〕希臘將於九月一日舉行公民投票，表決一度放逐之國王喬治二世復辟問題。此次投票係在國會反對派及英國勢力壓迫下，由保王黨政府主辦，將着重政體問題。左翼各黨曾於三月底，國會改選時，拒絕投票，此次則已表示參加八十六歲老政治家蘇福理斯爲三月間人民黨勝利前之內閣總理，一再指責舉行自由與忠實之投票，尚非其時。蘇氏爲共和主義派前輩，始終反對右翼人民黨，爲自由黨碩果僅存之元老。與蘇氏同列反對地位者，爲前總理三人：巴本特婁，加尼羅普洛斯，及維尼奇洛斯公子領導之全國聯合集團。共產黨支配之左派，已向共和主義派幹部示意，組成反喬治聯合陣綫，但該派幹部堅決拒絕與左派結合。右派組織嚴密，執政五月，防禦　固，重要位置均爲忠實之帝制派把持。甚至公開相信喬治將失敗之左翼份子，亦私下承認喬治回國勢不可免。　　英美聯合選舉監察團，刻正審閱三月間選舉名册之修正，該項名册爲反對派及棄權之左派所嚴厲指責。按喬治二世，被國人稱爲「不笑人」，係在德國伎入希臘之制出亡者。　　〔聯合社倫敦廿八日電〕希臘是否將隊入巴爾幹蘇聯軌道，或仍爲西方聯合國家在巴爾幹之惟一立足點，不出數日，似有實行攤牌之勢。希臘左翼共和黨與共黨，恃莫、斯科精神上援助，與保王黨鬥爭·已將兩載，終遭失利。在國內及倫敦之希方人士，均預測希王可獲勝利。目前之蔡爾達里斯內閣，係本年三月間選舉議會後所組成，爲公開之保王黨駐希臘大使返國　　〔本報訊〕倫教廿九日廣播：蘇聯駐希大使羅迭諾夫於返國前宣布，大使館職務由一等秘書却諾賽尹負責，由此可知大使之返國，並非蘇希斷絕外交關係之謂。羅氏於行前，曾往訪希外長、談四十五分鐘。英國內閣　傅將改組　　〔本報訊〕倫敦廿八日廣播：英國政界猜測：艾德禮首相正考慮大規模改組內閣，牽涉克里浦斯爵士／甚或其他閣員三人。首相官邸對此項猜測，拒絕置評。所奇者，昨有三家報紙，均載各該報政治特海員所發之類似消息蘇聯對土　領土野心　　〔路透社伊斯坦埠廿八日電〕紐約時報記者稱此間頃發現莫斯科所印，以俄文及亞美尼亞文所注釋之大亞美尼亞」地圖後，使人相信土耳其復已面臨蘇聯之另一　　，此等地圖係歿給土耳其及中東之亞美尼亞人者。依圖土國互萬平方哩之土地，約佔全國領土五分之一。北起基爾　港沿黑海岸至於西伐斯省，南迄近伊拉克邊界之地，均在大亞美尼亞之範圍以內。此一整片土地，絞蘇聯久已矚目之土國卡　斯及阿達漢兩省、約大三倍又半。英拒絕赫賽尼　出席倫敦會議　　美決定不派員旁聽　　〔本報訊〕倫敦廿九日廣播：英政府方面今日證實，美國雖已接獲英國之邀請，列席不久即將舉行之阿拉伯猶太英國巴勒斯坦會議，届時決定不派員旁聽。此間人士認爲美國此項決定，足以减少會議成功之希望。同時據殖民部稱，耶路撒冷同教主赫賽尼不致被邀出席會議。英總參謀揭示　和平三條件　　在加向參戰軍人演說　　〔法國新聞社渥太華廿九日電〕英國　蘇總長　哥馬利元帥的來加拿大訪問，木日向加拿大參戰車人發表演說，力言確保世界和平必須實行一二大條件：即（一）英國聯邦務須振作，並保持士氣。（二）英國聯邦務必保持當備軍，數額不多，但配備精良，訓練有素，同時更有優秀之後術軍爲援助。（三）英國聯邦務須從事科學研究及疏散工業。倫敦暴風雨　六年來所罕見　　〔聯合社倫敦廿九日電〕英國昨爲風雨所襲，五榖受損，海岸航運受阻，實爲六年來最猛烈者最長者各九歲，最幼者各一歲牛。八月五日野餐後留影於支加哥「三生嬰兒母親俱樂部。（美國新聞處攝寄）伊朗請示嚴重　張省要塞遭沙賽番部落攻擊　蘇方稱印軍萬名開抵巴斯拉　　〔本報訊〕倫敦廿九日廣播：伊朗發言人今日宣稱：大不列士以西九十哩相近裏海之亞塞爾拜然要塞亞第別爾，現正遭遇沙賽番部落之攻擊。據稱。亞塞爾拜然民主黨「損失慘重」　該城四郊發生游擊戰。查亞第別爾爲亞省首富城市之一，現該處一萬六千居民已陷入恐怖狀態。　　〔路透社莫斯科廿八日電〕蘇聯通訊社之德黑蘭電稱，印度軍一萬名已開抵巴斯拉，該地英軍官並聲言將進駐伊朗西南之寇迪斯坦省。蘇通訊社又謂，大宗軍火已自波斯灣之古匯及拜林運到，以便供給寇省內醞釀獨立之阿拉伯人。美國一貫政策　維護海洋自由　美艦隊行動他人無權干預　美艦隊行動他人無權干預　哈爾賽辛辣談話針對蘇聯　西半球聯防計劃推進中　　〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕美海軍宿將哈爾賽，今日爲蘇聯批評美艦隊游　東地中海事，特招待記者嚴辭加以反駁。　　〔路透社華盛頓廿八日電〕哈爾賽上將今日招待記者發表談話稱：美國在中南美諸國之合作下，正進行設立西半球防禦制度，以便於出事時，吾人得照顧此諸國之人民，並與其合作。哈爾賓上將爲太平洋戰爭之英雄，甫與陸軍參謀總長艾森　）威爾將軍，自南半球作親善之遊歷歸來。哈氏發言，素以潑辣著稱，渠答記者之問稱，吾人欲往何地，與他人無關，吾人將往任何所喜歡前往之地。但繼又聲明，美艦並不擬開人他國沿海，惟公海乃屬自由區，記者又詢以地中海是否亦爲美艦所得自由出入而不受批評之處。答曰：「余已聲明任何處所一點。哈爾賓網否認美國有恢復「大棍政策」干涉他國內政之意，並曰：「吾人需要好朋友

<p>訪李石會氏　關於「世界學典」書例　　轟動全國出版界之鉅著「世界學典」，即將陸續付刊，各界獲悉是項消息後，急欲洞識其內容與性質者殊衆，本報記者日前特爲此事往訪主編人之一的李石曾氏於滬　，經李氏悉心解答，　知一切詳情，茲轉述如次：　　猶憶民元前六年，吳稚暉·蔡孑民·張靜江·李石曾四先生，組世界社於巴黎、其主要事業之一，則　揚中國文化於國際，介紹國際文化於中國，以期建設世界性之新文化。編纂世界學典之世界學院，應溯始於此時。院長爲李氏，四十年來在國內外倡設研究院·大學·圖書館，博物館·書局·雜誌社·報社，電訊社及世界文化合作之社團與事業多所，皆世界學典表見之一端，或其相關之一環也。　　「學典」即Encyclopedia之新譚、舊譯稱「百科全書」，如十八世紀法國狄岱麓學典，曾影響於後來之法國革命，以至全世界之革命；而對思想解放，允著明效，啓蒙運動，因以成功，自由世界，藉建始基。近世最流行之學典，則有「大英百科全書」等一至現在編刊之世界學典，其體係爲李石曾氏據一新哲學新方法所創立，世界學者如愛因斯坦·　爾斯、赫里歐·阿達護等，皆極贊同，且有參加寫作者。除正在歐美等洲預備之英法等文字版外，中文版之歷史允爲久長，民元前五十七年，編國史通纂之史　閣，民元前四年譯狄岱　學典之海風樓，實爲今日正在編刋世界學典中文版之世界學院中國學典館之前身。該館現積有卡片約一千萬張，二萬萬字，理事長李比，親主編務，館長爲楊家駱氏，任職已十五年，正隨李氏，或共事新者，或就積稿改編。出版機關爲世界書局，其最先排成即可出版之一册爲楊家駱氏所著四庫全書學典，計二百四十萬字，聞印刷費，達一萬萬元以上，爲抗戰後出版物中之最巨者，其他各册，亦即陸續付印。　　今年二月，二中全會時李氏曾提「請建議政府設立機構推廣四庫全書義例纂修中華全書以利文化建設與溝通案」連署者有吳稚暉、王亮曉·居覺生·鄒海濱諸先生，經全會及常曾通過，送國民政府辦理。此册四庫全書學典，即以促成此項運動，並供給此項工作之技術及資料爲主旨，俾政府之中華全書與社會之世界學典相輔血成，以達成文化建設與溝迪之目的。允要者爲此册學典爲世界學典最先出版之一册，可見世界學典哲學與方法之一斑。至世界學典最主要之一冊，爲李氏所著之「世界」，除已於民國三十一年在紐約發表其引言一册外，現正在積極編纂中，問世之期，或亦不遠也。　　世界學院中國學典館已由四川復負通滬，世界學院又與韓籍學者設立朝鮮學典館，成立亦已半　，近已成朝鮮社會史一册及其他條文甚多，波斯學典館印度學典館等亦在籌設中，至巴黎及紐約華盛頓方面則成立已達數年，世界學院近編有「世界學典通訊」一種，其第一號聞日內即可由世界書局出版云。　　當讀者看到這部書的總名是「担界學典」，其下又繫　「中文版」三字，而這册的專名是「四庫全書學典」，在未翻閱內容前，或許會發生下列一串問題。因爲世界學典的名稱，體裁，形式及其哲學基礎與方法論等，皆煜積四十年之硏究所新創，旣爲新創，所以非有較詳的解釋，不易了解。但此種解釋，如以一般章程式的凡例來作，必致條目繁多，瑣碎難明，故現用問答體以代之：　　問：「做界」二字，是指自然世界—宇宙呢？還是指地理世界—地球呢？還是指人類世界—國際呢？　　答：人類世界爲地理世界所知較詳部份；地理世界爲自然世界所知較詳部份。　　自然世界的現象，是從光雲，銀河，恒星，行星到原子；地理世界的現象，是從氣圈，海，陸到其中每一種礦，植動物；人類世界的現象，從史前經有史到今日以至未來的個人，聚落，羣體以及世界的聯邦。還有這一切世界之理論的綜合—世界哲學，都屬於世界學典所論述之知識的範圍。　　問：「學典」二字似係一新詞·其來源與含義如何？作爲書名時，其體裁如何？與「字典」，「辭典」所異在何處？　　答：「學典」即拉丁文「Encycjopedia」（英，法文同），有「所講的學術環繞在內」之意。後凡包括一切學術在內—呈　「知識世界」且多係按辭典次序排列的書，每用此詞以構成其書名，於是此辭成爲書體之一種　　四十年前余首譯「Encyclopedia」一詢曰「百科類典」，後中國因受「四庫全書」命名的影饗，改譯爲「百科全書」。近二世紀專科的「Encyclopedia」出版頗多，在中文有一中國文學百科全書」等。文學本百科中之一科，固然其中亦可析爲多科，然於一科之名下，復繫以「百科」二字，終覺不十分妥當。且「全書」二字，在中文易與「四庫全書」之叢書式的全書相混，不足表示其爲另一書體，故余後又改譯爲「學典」。「學」以知識全體爲對象，「字」，「辭」僅指語言符號而言。「字典」、「辭典」之任務，在解釋語言符號之形，聲，義，用，「學典」雖不能離語言符號以爲書，然除可賅字典，辭典之解釋外，而尤應推廣於知識本身之詳盡的論述。故字典，辭典之條目，僅由字與辭組成；而學典之條目，除字與　外，尚有複合多數字與辭而成之論文名稱式的各種專題。　　「字典」，「辭典」旣以解釋語言符號爲主，故體裁祗須按語言符號之機械次序排列即可；學典旣以論述知識全體爲主故其中除關於各「字」，「辭」，「題」之論述須按「辭典」式排列外，其前尚須有融貫此項知識的「通論」，其後尚須有表示此項知識之交互綜錯關係興此項知識成爲社曾性行動之技術的「徵覺。　　這三部：「通論」是備論的，但亦夾排小字備查；「辭典」是備查的，但亦有長文備讀；「徵覽」有的是備　的，有的是備查的，甚至有的是備行的。　　「通論」，「辭典」，「徵驚」三部的名稱，當施於世界學典每些特殊專册時，亦可因其特殊情形而改易。但分爲三部和三部的性質則完全一致。　　問：「學典」已足表示係用一書體呈顯出的「知識世界」，何必更加「世界」二字？且如「大英百科全書」，亦以呈顯知識世界爲任務，現世界學典與其加「中文版」三字，何不易稱「中國學典」呢？　　答：在「世界學典」問世前，「大英百科全書」可以說是近代學典的典型，我們對這種典型，試提十大缺點來作解答上述問題的根據：　　第一，「大英百科全書」亦以呈顯知識世界爲任務，他的三千七百個撰稿人，一半是美國籍，其餘來自六十一個不同的國家。但牠旣以英文編成，自以供給英語民族應用爲主，其內容遂不得不側重英語民族的需要。編者加爾文（J．L．Garvin）甚至在序言首立一「英語世界」的標題，誇耀英語民族的成就，所以牠所呈顯的，祗是英語民族二萬萬人的知識世界，而非全人類二十萬萬人的知識世界。　　第二，在一百七十八年的長時期中，她陸續改編出至第十四版，此版從第一册A至Anno……第二十三册Vase至Zygo，第二十四册爲地圖和無獨立應用性的全書索引。這廿四册的體積，不能說不大，但以較知識此界之已經樻有的分量，和未來發展的無限，則實渺小而不能爲其代表。加爾文在序言中一面說：這二十四册「似乎對於任何人類需要，都足够了」；一面又說：「事實上每一歷史的，宗教的，哲學的，物理的，國際名人傳的，法律的，更不要說文學的學典，都要有這些一册，而無一廢」字；電話是否自相矛盾呢？同時前二十三册係按條目字母次序一貫的排列起米，強割千頁爲一製訂單位，第二十四册又無獨立應用性，所以抽去一册則首尾不具，所另編的年鑑，五年彙編等，則又成不能獨立存在的寄生物。所以他雖想呈顯知識世界的一切，而反將知識凝固爲互大的冰塊。同時這樣的體積，除了陳列在圖書館　書　中外，亦賞無法適應這航空時代，人類常常在流動着的需要　　第三，大英百科全書十四版共約三千五百萬字，出版後加入的編輯兪史機（W．Yust）和他的同事，承認他們永遠不能將那二中四火册的原稿閱嶺與整理一過；據說讀者中曾讀畢第十三版的，也祇有三個人。因爲牠的體積，比起知識世界所有，誠極渺小；但　包含的分量和學科，實已超出個人担負的能力之上。固然對各學科自有專家爲其閱讀與整理者，但一書之所以成爲一書，不僅在其形式的一致，而允在其內容的相關。這些其「運用之妙實存乎「心」，非可以會議式的商談來解決的。旣無一人能爲這一貫次序排列之書閱讀整理一過，那牠祇成爲各題論文與解釋的堆砌而已。這樣適形成其祗爲一知識的百貨公司，而失去知識世界的「有機體性」了。加爾文在序言中曾一再歌誦十八世紀的「狄岱麓學典」說她：「充滿生動的描寫與時代的理論，是急進思想的兵工廠，眞實知識的總倉庫，……立即發生空前的社會影響，非後代任何學典所可比擬。即其綜合，分配，排比等純粹編輯的技術，也不較十四版大英百科全書爲次。」這固由於十八世紀學典派學者共同的努力與其觀念的相近，然精力過人的主編狄岱麓，曾以其尺度通全稿二千二百萬字，使有共同而一致的表現實其主因。可惜後代學典，祗學到他的編輯技術而未能總閱整理之於一共同觀念下，固由後代「思想與實騐的無限推廣與加深，學典的編者們已遭遇日趨嚴重的困難」，蓋「知識……進展，已非任何人的精力在任何時間所能全窺」（皆加爾文序言中語），然而我們就不能尋覓一條新途徑來解決這困難，而令我們永遠不能儘量利用人類已獲的知識嗎　　第四，因爲上述的緣故，加爾文祗好在序上說：「對於像本書若干萬頁所包含的知識，要想繪出其全體印象，及其無數部類的個別認識，久已非人力所可及了。」於是這部書除了印刷的彙集外，實未給予我們以所謂「知識世界」之整體的通論式的記述、一部學典不能達到這個目的我們更將求之於何書呢？　　第五，狄岱農曾說：「若將人類或其優秀份十驅除盡絕，則舊發卓越之萬物景象，勢必成一慘淡無聲之大劇塲，且全世界亦將岑寂無聞，而變爲荒凉凄漠之狀態。至若天然景象，亦將默然無色矣」（狄岱　學典V．5p．641「學典」條）！這幾句話我們很可借來說學典中必容古今中西名作原著的重要。大英百科全書中雖也有介紹那些原著的條文，有如我們祗聽到講說戲劇的本事，而非親自看到出演一樣。要知那些原著實爲知識世界一涓一滴的構成者，把那些原著屏除在學典以外，無異將人類或其優秀份子驅除在世界之外一樣，那未所呈顯的知識世界，至少也將最精華的部份除外了！　　第六，第十四版大英百科全書共有四萬五千條，又索引五十萬條（其中第二十四册地岡上的地名索引，即佔十餘萬條），人類已知的知識之命題命名，僅有此數麽？照世界學院中國學典館所搜集，雖側重於中國，而尚未完，已達一千餘萬條，固然其中有些是絕對不必要而可删併的，但也絕不止五十四萬五千條。加爾又說：「現代生活，沒有充分時間去搜尋知識，却有更多的需要須求取知識、」人們旣無時間搜尋知識，學典正應代之搜尋而無遺；旣有更多需要求取知識，學典正應滿足所需始爲功。倘如我們在呈顯知識世界的學典中，尋不出我們所需的知識之論述取解釋，那我們更將求之何書呢？　　第七，即以每題而論，大英百科全書祗選用某人所作的某條，倘其他一人所寫因觀點或敍述方式的不同而亦有其參考價値時，那也祗好割愛了。這種「排他性」，有如祗准戴着指定顏色的眼鏡去看外界一樣。知識世界是多面的，怎樣能令人看出其多面性麽？　　第八，各寫各條，又無法爲全部的整理，於是各條間難於連藥，各知識的個性，縱可無傷，而與其他知識的相關性，却遭割裂，好像法庭上原告，被告和證人的話，永遠不能投合一樣。要知知職的存在，正如宇宙的存在。　星球間無相吸與相拒的作用，星球必至脫軌而亂馳；知識間無個性與相關的存在，知識必至爲用而不全。不但如此，甚至大英百科全　會有這樣一件有趣的　事：當編者把一篇登載了若干年的歷史論文送給某大學歷史學系老主任去審閱，請他略加訂正。結果復函中盡是帶有辛辣的評語：「毫無組織，不確與錯誤之處，　見迭出」；並附言「願爲另作」。但編者查閱原稿，當年是作」。但編者查閱原稿，當年是誰替他們寫了這樣一篇「無組織」而「不確與錯誤」的文章呢？等到證實正是那位教授自己所作時不禁大吃一驚。然而在大英百科全書這樣體例的書中，怎能避免這些矛盾呢？　　第九，用辭典式排成知識的行伍，一因命題衆多，非此難以部署；一因分類難確，非此不易檢尋。但在某些需要上，有時要將某些知識按時間次序排列，或空間方位排列，或性類區別排列，或其他特殊方式排列。所以「辭典式」雖是知識叙列的主式，但他式亦難絕對屏除而不用。且「Encyclopedia」一詞，本無專按語言符號排列之意。爲將知識世界呈顯得更明白些，其他方式在學典中能完全被擯而不用麽？即以辭典式而論，因爲大英百科全書採取多册一貫的排列法於是曾發生過這樣的事情：當五十多年前有名的常被翻印的第九版，正在編纂，編者請「氬」的發明者，諾貝爾獎金獲得人瑞雷勛爵（L．Raylorgh）寫一篇關於光學極重要的文章，預定放在第十四册中。等到那册付印時瑞雷還禾交稿，幾經催促，他說可以放在「O」集中，題目改爲optics（光學）。等到「O」集付印，仍未交稿，並要求延到「U」集，說題目算是Undulatary　Theoryof　Light（光之波動說）罷。但結果瑞當的文章，是在「W」集出現，題目樊成Wave　Theoryof　Light（道是光的波動說）了。　　第十，爲行而求知，知而不行，求知爲何？在學典中應如何使知與行間，建立起一個聯鎖來呢。　　這些問題，或者有人以爲是「學典」的形體限制，而無可如何的！加爾文也坦率的在序言中說：「有些莊嚴的哲學家們，曾夢想以一憫世紀的光陰完成一部理想的學典，然而就要失掉其主要效能了。當其後部出來的時候，其前部則已萎廢—這種進行，就好比點一長排臘燭，在中途上就把前一隻燭吹滅而另燃一隻一樣。」「厄士（Ersch）與葛魯貝爾（Gruber）。等專門學者所作的「科學文藝百科全書，」在一世紀多以前就開始，已經出了一百七十本，可是還美有完。木爾茲博士（Merz）於其十九世紀歐洲思想中對於這巨大而沒有完的工作，作了很實際的觀察：「這個工作的推動者們，顯然沒有認淸要使這類工作有效的兩個要點—：就是無論如何，不完全也必完成，又因思想與知識上的革命與演進，必定在一個限定的時間之內完成。」「在這種工作上，還有和時間同樣重要的因素，就是空間；以出版家來說，就是所佔的篇幅。把本書的十四版限於二十四册，是合理的。」我們覺得加爾文所說的哲學家的夢想，在我們看來，那夢想距實際固然太遠，距夢想却將更遠。因爲如加爾文所憂慮或木耳茲所觀察，那「哲學家」未免太不實際；但眞正呈顯知識世界的學典，亦非一個世紀的事，而爲與人類來日同其久遠的事。這話不但比加爾文所說的哲學家更夢想，而且比他甚至比加爾文更實際。此點在後面所說出的辦法，當可證明。那辦法且解除加爾文所憂慮的出版困難，及二十四册是不合理的。倘以二十四册爲滿足，即正如加爾文所說：「每一知識部門，都要來……更多的篇幅……，如賽克瑞（Thackeray）對拿比爾（Nopier）一樣可憐的喊道：「你把我的血肉割去了」最後加爾文無可如何的說：「一百册或一百多册，仍是不能解決這些相對的問題的—」然而我們却想出一個辦法，將過去學典從形體限制中解放出來。上面試提的十大缺點，和加爾文已在憂慮的，可一舉而解決。簡單些說，是使「學典」成爲「有機體」，然而不是一個神蹟。　　世界學典的「世界」二字，不僅表示着知識的範圍，他是用各種文字由各民族各地方按各思想各學科分頭編纂，爲各個獨立的自爲起止首尾完具的專册。同時谷文字又各有關於「世界」，「學典」等，總册，以爲聯絡。道樣不惟有海，陸，空軍的大國可有其學典，即弱小民族亦可各有其學典！甚至「黑人」我們也正在替他準備一册學典了。但其體誠與書式，完全一律，且互有詳略，互相徽引，互相溝通。所以世界學典又名「世界聯合學典」，現在亞，歐，美，三大洲，我們不但已在用多　民族語文如中，英，法文等分頭編纂，即少數民族如亞洲之朝鮮，歐洲之猶太，及南美之數小國，亦在用其習用之文字在編纂中。至中國境內少數民族，亦多有其文字，將來亦可各有其學典。且國外也許有人願以中文編著學典者，所以現正用中文出版者，不稱「中國版」，而稱「中文版」。　　世界學典各册，不但內容相關，無論何種文字版本，即陳列於一書架上，尺寸裝訂亦均相同。世界學典版本尺寸，共有二種：一爲圖書館本，備固定陳列之用者；一爲袖珍本，由圖書館本用薄紙縮印，所以要規定每册不能超過一千五百頁者，因在一千五百頁以上，縮印雖用薄紙，亦難裝入衣袋之中。倘內容字數非一千五百頁所能容時，則折爲兩個以上的專册，仍使各册獨立爲　，此所以爲有機體者二。　　各册自爲起止，出版不限於一時一地，因之可成專册的某學科，無論其範圍的大小，同對象者而觀點興表示方法不同者，不妨各自爲册，即僅爲辭典中之一條的條文，同題亦可由多人撰作，分見有關各册，而可各　其說。某册增删再版，亦不牽及全體。新知職後得時，隨時可編印一册，加入其中。所以分頭刋行，相距無妨萬里；繼續出版，可至人類末日，同時無所謂第一册，第二册……，或首册，末册，或主册，附册；或共幾册；其出版光後，亦不代表次序的觀念，此所以爲有機體三。　　每種文字版本的主編者，祗同與另一文字版本及此種文字版本册與册間聯絡之責。至於每册又各有其主編者，因祗一千五百頁，在中文最多容三百萬字，所以一人亦可勝任其編著。縱其中文字，係多人所寫，此册主編者亦不難全閱整理一過，成於一手，則全册可以貫串融洽，不致使這學典成爲無靈魂而堆砌物，此所以爲有機體者四。　　一般工具　，除檢查外，有「不知從何談起」之苦；一般備讀的專書，又與一般工具　無聯絡　通關係，所以其中應方分述或解釋的，又有不知從何查起之苦；至於書與書間知與行間，除少數書外，更是了無關係。世界學典版與版間，册與冊間，頁與頁間，行與行間，無不互相聯絡溝通，因此及彼，有若貫珠　此所以爲有機體者五。　　古今中西的名著，我們並不因其具有權威性而懾服其下我們祗把他看成世界或其一部份說得最清楚的代言者。知職即非我們這一代或寫作學典者所專有，反之，是世界永遠共有而又造福於世界之不容遺葉的財產·未來名著，世界學典固已留有固地，供其植根；已往名著，亦應以之各答代學典一册中之通論；或爲某册辭典一條，或微覺引錄文獻之一篇·於是後人將成我們的編著者，古人則已成我們的編著者，此所以爲有機體者六。　　世界學典通論之部，可易以原著；辭典之部每册能容的條目數，固不免有其最高的限制，但各册繼出不窮，而條目乃成無盡數；同時不惟徵覺之部時時注意採用辭典以外的方法，使知識儘量表示其交亙綜錯的多種釵列方式，倘如必要，在辭典之部的地位，亦可易以「年典」，「地誌」，「類典」或其他方式，至於「微覺」之部，可容有關文獻，可容編著者稿本與編印本有出入之「自然本」的攝影，而允其重要的是關於由知而行的「社會按術」關係文學的提供。一切一切，都表示世界學典是體例精密，而又同時是活躍有生命的書，此所以爲有機體者七。　　世界學典不惟在紙上，而且我們已以四十年的努力從事與其配合的文化建設，且編及亞、歐·美三大洲，受其影響者已有衆多的人數，我們相信這不過是其開　的開端而已。牠大則象徵宇宙，小則變爲酵菌，現此酵菌方始投入世海之中，必可引起化學的反應。呈顯一敏速的催化劑作用，其中之誘因而發酵於世海者，正如擲石水中其波圈的一層一層的擴大一棣。此所以爲有機體者八。　　總而言之：世界學典的體裁，是取法於自然世界的聯合，而成學典世界的聯合，以達大同世界的聯合。上文曾說到十八世紀狄　　學典成功要素，除技術外，尤在其觀念，世界學典是將技術與觀念合而爲一，這裏可簡單的標出，一如其書名「世界學典」或「世界聯合學典」！社會服務答覆者　醫藥生　　（一）　瘡奇　　　王兼問　小女生甫六月，尚未種痘，近染疥瘡（家人均染乾疥瘡）已將一月，奇癢難忍，唯精神愉快，現擬種痘，未知能種否！所患之疥，胸背現紅色，中微隆起，一如臭虫或蚊子咬過之「塊」然，不破奇癢，自生自滅，丰縫脈息處有如沙粒少水泡，望賜良方。　　（醫學博士余新恩答）應先醫治疥瘡，可塗硫黃油膏。宋美芬問茲有醫學問題數則祈予解答，（一）經凈三日後，總要發生腹痛一次，但用赤沙糖，沸水冲服後即愈，但下次來後仍復如前。未卜何故，應如何治療？（二）月經每來三四月即停止一二月，婚後五年皆如此，在停止期間身體一切如常，不知何故？有何藥可治？或係天然，有四季洗之語，有其實事吾？（三）結婚已五年。仍未受孕何故？　　（醫學博士余新恩答）大槪係十宮位置不正，或輸卵管堵塞之故，應就婦科專門醫師診察。　　（三）濃痰鼻涕　　凌文奎問　茲有醫藥問題數則，　賜解答：舍弟年二十，二年前起即患多痰，大多爲白沬，現益厲？濃痰鼻涕甚多，且帶微咳，白沫較前更多，未知是何病　？何法可根治？　　（醫學博士余新恩答）似爲慢性支氣管發炎，最好螢光透視一次，診察肺部有無病徵，然後據情治療。　　（四）自　　害　　張健問　敝人於四年前娛犯手淫，致患遺精滑精，曾服市上所售各　皆未見效，去春，就診於針科醫生打針服藥一月餘亦無起色，現見色流精，發育不全，痛苦殊甚，　請　告治療方法。　　（醫學博士余新恩答）宜多作健身運動，以助發育，並增强肌肉之伸縮力，太和產科職校　招收免費生　　須先經本欄證明手續　　逕啓者：敝校茲爲救濟失學靑年起見，曾設有免費生，半費生，工讀生等助學額二十名，茲以申請踴躍，額少人多，不敷分配爲再增設免費額十名，並爲普及計，擬懇貴報賜予協助，凡經　　貴報介紹或證明者，一經考試錄取，學雜費全部免收，素仰貴報服務社會，熱心教育，用敢函凟，即請兪允勿却爲　！此致申報私立太和高級助產職業學校啓（本校考期八月三十日並定九月二日開學）沈敘倫堂　贈「吐血藥草」　　敬啓者：敝宅謹遵先人遺命，繼續配製「吐血藥草」，普送各界，已歷有年，因具相當效驗，頗蒙服者贊揚，承輾轉介紹，故索者接踵惜事變後期以原料無從購獲，致萬不得已，嘗一度停送，徒勞遠近病家函電往返衷心不安，甚於同患，刻幸原料暢達，業已配就大批，藉供急需，且爲便利索取起見，再托上海白克路同春坊四十七號博濟局代送，不論面索函索，均不取分文，以踐素願，爲特專函奉懇，務求貴報本服務社會造福人羣之偉大精神，祈將此函賜予刋登，不勝盼　之至，貴報惠及病家。功德無量，肃此敬呈申報社會吸務欄沈叙倫堂啓招領失物　皖孫傳球君注意　　編輯先生：敝人於廿四日赴杭途中，趁24路公共汽車，手提零物小包一扎，係報紙包成，偶於車上人數擁擠間索鬆墜落，當經拾起擠裝另携之提包內，當時未便細檢，至杭啓提包時，瞥見有一包，內有「安徽省立第九中學畢業臨時證明書一張，上題學生孫傳球，係安徽穎上縣人，及曁南大學准考證及報名費收據，國立上海醫學院准考證，震旦大學投考證，私立上海法政學院准考證，中國新聞專科學校報名收據各一紙。又英文講義二本，練習簿二本，英數史地筆記一本，英漢字典一本，以上各件均題有孫君之名，又有各色相片多張」，因余赴杭事繁，故延至木日帶滬，請借貴報一角，披露招領，並請來高安路80街22號朱竭　君處領回。讀者上</p>

<p>衛生与医药病人與醫生  林兆耆　　人的一生難免要生病，生了病就要請敎醫生。醫生對於解除人生痛苦，負有神聖的使命，病人在病中對於醫生的期待與希望，是無可比喻的。茲將病人與醫生應有的態度及兩者間的關係，約略的談一談。人與人關係的協調，在於互相諒解，在於知己知彼，醫生和常人一樣，有機會生病，所以比較上瞭解病人，而大多病人則不是醫生，故不能洞悉醫生的困難。病人與醫生，拿流行的名詞來說是「同盟國」他們共同的敵人是疾病，他們的共同目標是戰勝疾病，所以應當和衷共濟來完成這個目標。　　完備醫生的條件　　醫生是應用科學家。他的思想行動應當由科學觀點出發；換句話說，他當有冷靜的頭腦，客觀的觀察，探求眞理的至誠，多用腦，少用嘴來研究病原病理。醫生的主要使命，是根除病原；要是病原在現代科學無從根除時，祇的解除痛苦，這是指臨床醫生而言。醫學至上的目標，是預防疾病，這比治療疾病更重要更基本更澈底。醫生和物理化學數學等科學家不同，因爲他的對象是生物，不但是生物，而且是萬物之靈的人，是有情感和智慧的人，因此做一個完備的醫生，不但對於醫學及其基本科學要有根底，同時對於人情事故，要有相當的認識。不過病人不是醫生主要的對象，主要的對象是疾病，而疾病是不通人情不講交情的，所以臨床醫生，一定要把握着這一點，要「就病治病」。凡疾病治療上所需要的，無論病家何等的反對，定要執行或勸導執行。譬如說，一個病人患了劇烈的腹痛，第一步工作，是找出致痛的原由，合理治療，不能依病人的意志爲意志，注射嗎啡或其他止痛針，求一時的痛苦解除，而延長了病理變化，以致簡單的急性盲腸炎，　成了威脅生命的化膿性的腹膜炎　　避直就輕，人之常情。有的診斷試騐及治療方法，難免要增加病人的痛苦，如從根除病原上着想，非此不可，則決不依從病人，逃避現實。譬如說，一個病人患了早期胃癌，則非用「愛克司光」「胃鏡」等檢査不可。如診斷證實後，則非開刀割治不可　，無近路可抄，也無商量的餘地，因爲胃癌是不和你商量的，如不早期割治，它要無情的蔓延，一最後斷送了病人寳貴的生侖。　　病人有肉體上及精神上雙層的痛苦，當醫生的應當有同情心及體貼心。縱然病人有時出言不遜，也應常加以原諒，因爲病人不是常人，和他們爭執吵鬧，在醫生立塲言，是有失「運動家的風度」，所謂「Sportsmanship」。　　除了醫學根基，科頭腦學，和同情病人外，最重要的當推醫德。醫生是人，也需要物質條件而生活，受相當酬報是應該的，但是同時也需要拿出全副精神全部科學訓練來服務病家。無論「診斷」「病情經過」及「治療方針」，須絕對公開。如病理複雜或病勢嚴重，應該自動的徵求病家同意，邀請學識經騐豐富的同道來會診；會診的意義是共同硏究討論，共同探求眞理，不是讓主治醫生規避責任。　　做病人的藝術　　現在要講如何做病人。做病人要有做病人的藝術；病人英文是Patient，就是要忍耐的意思譬如說，傷寒症通常有一個月的過程，病家不應無理要求醫生縮短這個過程。因爲醫生是人，不是超人，在此症無特效　前，縮短過程，他是愛莫能助的。　　往往有病家問醫生，這病你能担保嗎？這眞是天大的笑話。醫生不是保險業掮客，也不是保險公司老闆，他怎能保呢？保了出事了，他能製造同樣的人來賠償嗎？醫生僅能貢獻最近代的科學醫術及盡他最大的努力來挽救病人的生命，套一句俗話，「醫生只能醫病，不能醫命。」　　一般的病家，以爲醫生是萬能，倘若醫生經過詳細檢査硏究後，對病家說，現在還不能明確診斷，在診斷未明確前，不能下藥，那病家不重視醫生的誠實，而輕視醫生的「飯桶」。要知道醫學是活的科學，越是有學術經騐的醫生，他越深切瞭解診斷治療的艱難。醫學和其他科學一樣，需要證據及事實來充實結論，不能像舊醫舉出「看不見」「摸不着」的「肝火」「濕溫」「氣處」等抽象名詞來滿足病家的「診斷慾一。　　有很多的病家，在病人危急之時，　請醫生。醫生間的程度，相差太遠，無從會商，或科學醫與舊醫聚於一堂，南轅北轍，風馬牛不相及。病家的心理，以爲新舊醫及名醫都看過了，即死也無怨。這是缺乏理智常識及科學頭腦的幼稚心理。家人生病，自然容易衝動情感，但是情感解決不了冷酷的事實，這是拿神聖的醫學當兒戲，也是拿病人常兒戲。　　病家的估計醫生，往往拿結果爲唯一的標準，而不知道病，火體說來，有三種：第一種是不治也會好的，這是大自然的恩賜，第二種須經過科學醫的治療，始能醫愈的，第三種是非現代科學所能救的如白血症肝癌等。一般病家不分靑紅皂白，只講結果，不講事理，有時產生病人死亡全是醫生過失的變態心理，以致怕事及潔身自愛的醫生，環境不容許他任勞任怨，因而拒絕診視垂危的病人；吃虧的，無疑的是病人，因爲垂危的病人，不加　勇敢的科學治療，更缺乏生機·　　聯合起來，打到疾病！　　醫學是科學，科學是日　月異，推陳出新，不斷前進的、一般人對於飲食起居，希　有最時代化的享受，而對於攸關生命健康的醫學，則有一種牢不可破的守奮心理。在保存「國粹」的口號下，人們不能開倒車，不能阻撓中國科學的發展。科學醫是全世界不分國籍古今中外科學家絞盡腦汗的結晶，所謂中醫國醫或舊騰，沒有解剖生理病理細菌學等的基礎，僅靠按脈膊，看舌苔來診斷，眞是荒謬無比。根木不能診斷、治療更無從談起。舊醫充其量僅爲醫學歷史，古代的刀劍，怎能與現代原子彈比擬？每年我國寃枉死的雖然沒有準確統計，這數目一定是驚人的。往往急性結核症，被舊醫斷爲傷寒，粒米不准進口，所謂「餓不死的傷寒」。痛心得很，每年要餓死無數的傷寒病人。傷寒病人，吃容易消化及高熱力的飲食，可以補充因高熱度及新陳代謝增加所引起的過度營養消耗，同時可以增加抵抗力，抵抗細菌，預防加雜症及縮短恢復時期。　　總括的說，生病是不幸之事，旣生了病，要針對事實，忍耐，從速請有科學頭腦及醫德高尚的醫生來診治。現代科學不能做到「長生不老」，但至少能做到不寃枉死及不寃枉受痛苦。提起枉死及枉受痛苦，在中國是多麽的普遍呀！讓科學醫及不幸的病家，携手起來，聯合起來，打倒人生最大的敵人疾病。精神病可以消滅嗎？  張沅昌　　心理衛生的重要　　精神病這個名稱在中國還沒有普遍的被認識，可是她的存在是隨時隨地可以遇到的，住在精神病院裏的是嚴重的精神病，可是進了精神病院以後，對於社會上的損害，決不像沒有進精神病院的精神病患者那樣的嚴重，允其是精神病患者被社會所沒有發覺和認識的，那可能發生的損害、是太可怕了，每天拿出報紙來看，總是充滿了「精神不健全」所產生的記錄，這是在世界各國共有的現象，分析這些精神病態的記錄是脫不了疑妒，欺詐，仇恨，衝突，爭訟，偷盗，侵佔，暗殺，離婚，遺棄，自盡等種種不道德和反社會的行動，總結這些失常行爲的主要原因、是個人的精神不健全，不健全就是「病」，雖然文化與科學在日新月異的進步，到目前爲止，世界上沒有一個地方沒有這精神不健全的行爲，假使一定要來一個分別的話，那分別不是「有」與「無」的問題，充其量是「多」與「少」的問題，因爲是「病」，我們就要「醫」，非但要醫並且要「防止」牠不發、更進一步要根本「消滅」他、治療醫學不能使疾病消滅，現在大家都注重預防醫學了，因爲生了病再醫治，比不生病是在各方面都不經濟，關於精神病，也就脫離不了提倡「心理衛生」來預防精神病發生的道理。　　根據了宇宙間「有生有滅」的定律來觀察精神病，那精神病能够產生，也一定能够消滅的，把產生精神病的原因解決了，那不就是把精神病消滅了嗎？目前的困難點是還沒有完全知道產生精神病的原因，可是我們已經知道產生精神病，一定有「個人」的和「環境」的因素、環境一部份是天定的，可是「人定勝天」的今日，環境的大部份還是個人所能控制得住的，所以這二個因　之中，個人的原因是最重要、一個健全的個人，雖在惡劣的環境中，他還能適應而不生精神病相反的，精神不健全的個人，在優　的環境里，也免不了要生精神病，所以要消滅精神病，一定要創造精神健全的個人—「健全的人格。」　　優生的生育滅絕　　人格是由先天的遺傳和後天的環境所造成的、許多精神病都是有遺傳的傾向的、要消滅精神病，一定先要不　這些精神病的種子遺傳給子孫，優生學是硏究這遺傳問題的學科，最簡易的實施方法是精神病人的「優生的生育滅絕」。生育滅絕是使精神病人沒有生育的機能，但是性生活　是有的，最可靠而簡便的方法是女性輸卵管及男性輸精管的結紥手術，「節制生育」是一個不妥善的方法，因爲精神病人根本不能和不會認眞的採用，結果是難保不生育有潜伏性精神病傾向的子女來貽害社會，如果世界上各地同時實行精神病人的「生育滅絕」，我們的下一代就沒有遺傳性的精神病了，這是一個消滅精神病的良好方法，在中國要實行這「優生的生育滅絕一是有很大的困難，在一不孝有三，無後爲大」的占訓下，我們時常碰到古式的精神病治療法，「冲喜」將精神疾人結婚來治療精神病，這結果是散播精神病的種于給下一代，這種開倒車式的辦法，一定要用普及社會敎育的方法來改　，要使人知道精神病遺傳的嚴重性。同時要國家制定法律强制執行遺傳性精神病人的「生育滅絕」，不然精神病就不會消滅　　兒童心理指導所　　人生的過程可以分爲嬰兒，兒童，少年，中年和老年五個時期，從精神衛生的目光來看，兒　期是塑成人格最重要的時期，每一個人的精神生活是否健全，就是看他在兒童期的發展是不是健全，兒童期中最主要的環境是「家庭」和「學校」，所以「父母」與「教師」是兒童日常所最多接觸的，兒童是富於模仿性的，父母與敎師的行動都能影響兒童的發展，在兒童的心目中，都拿父母與敎師作爲他們的模範，所以父母與敎師是他們精神衛生的基本導師。但是現在有多少父母與教師，知道他們所負的重大責任和神聖使命！要使父母與敎師有效的完成這培養精神建全的兒童，那又是敎育家的責職，要提倡父母敎育和加强師範敎育中對於兒童健全精神生活的認識和實施，常父母與敎師遭遇到困難的時候，就可以向「兒童心理指導所」去求得解決，「兒童指導所」是一個硏究和診治精神不健全兒童的組織，由精神病專家，小兒科專家，心理學專家和社會工作員所主持，但是牠的工作要父母，敎師，法官和社會人士共同合作，方能達到完滿的成績。這是預防成人精神病的先鋒，也是消滅精神病過程中所不可缺少的橋樑。　　精神病可以消滅麼？答語是可以的，牠的步驟是普及敎育，使國民認職精神健全的重要，再提高教育，創造精神健全的人格，在達到消滅精神病目標之前，實施「優生的生育滅絕」和創立「兒童心理指導所」是牠的先決條件，心理衛生運動可以說是達到上述工作的總名稱。人與病菌之戰（一）　摘自「傳染病管理」  喬樹民　　人類在太古時代，與毒蛇猛獸相雜處，並無爪牙之利，祇　着人們的智慧，戰勝了毒蛇猛獸，乃得平土而居，保特其種族的延續，發展其優美的文化。現在，毒蛇猛獸是不足患了。但是、我們發現有更多厲害的生物，暗中在殺害人類、比毒蛇猛獸遺刻毒些，還兇猛些，那便是一切致病的微生物了。（簡稱病菌）假使我們不能克服那些微生物。人類將無噍類，休談發展今後的文化。　　歷來大戰之後，疾疫每易流行。良以兵　頻仍，人口異動至劇，或輾轉於溝　。或流離於這途，營養欠缺，攝護無方，迨至全民複員之日，亦即各方病歡會合之時，於是疫癘叢生、傳染猖獗，死亡之禍，殆較戰爭爲尤烈—　　疫癘者何？傅染病之流行是也。所謂傳染病，是能由一人（或物）而傳染給衆人的疾病，是中國人民超額死亡的最主要原因。所謂傳染病管理，是運用科學方法來控制這個災害，以滅免人類不必要的痛苦和超額的死亡，要能有效地控制管理傳染病，首須明瞭　　傳染病的三個要素　　吾人試默察自然界之農作物之長成、必須備有「種子」，又須加以「播種」，還須種入適合的「土壤」。傳染病的發生，亦復如此，也必須具備這樣三個要案，茲分論之：　　一種子—病原體及病源　　疾病的原因，有爲物理性的，有爲化學性的，有爲生物性的，有爲精神性的等等不一，但一切傳染病。無不各有其獨特之微生物的病原體。　　不僅從細菌學及免疫學的立塲，可以看出傳染病的獨特性，即於臨牀學方面以及流行病學方面，各種傳染病亦無不各顯示其獨特性、就流行病學立塲言之，舉凡年齡·性別·季節·地理·環境·氣候·交通·傳染方式，免疫力輕重　度，以及內外潛伏期限等，均在考慮比較之列。至於臨牀症象之千殊萬別，恒用爲診斷之資，共獨特性更無待待深論。　　吾人旣知各種傳染病，皆各有其獨特之病原體，則所謂傳染病之種子者，究何所指？此荒指貯帶具有相當傳染小力及置力的病原體之人或動物也。梵病原體者、致病的微生物也，除一二特殊例外外。此類徽生物，均不能在自然界中獨立生存甚久或繁殖，必於動物或人體內之適當蔭蔽，始得遂其生存與繁殖之獲能。是故動物與人，實僞傳染病的主要來源或大太營，茲分述之。　　（一）患病的人—傳染病的患者本身便成病源，自無問題。惟有時患者病症輕微，不易覺察，每每忽視，而不知其實際上亦爲主要的病源。　　（二）带菌者（一名菌郵）—「帶有致病微生物的人、其本身不顯示任何症狀、却能傳染疾病給他人者，謂之帶菌者。」因其本身不顯示任何病狀，故最易忽視；就團體幸福言，亦最　危險。　　上述之「出病的人」及「帶菌者」，均爲帶病菌的人，所不同者，爲症狀之有無。實則，症狀之輕重隱顯，又千差萬別，猶如物理學上之光带，可有若干輕重不同之程度。自臨床上治療立塲而論，自以重症病人爲電要，爲需要特別照護。但自傳染病管理立塲而論，則其重要性適相反。因重症病人，或住院，或臥床，行動受有限制，傳播疾病之機會，因而减少，即使行動上無何限制，人咸知其爲病人，亦皆知所防範或避離。獨此帶菌者與極輕性的患者，行動旣無拘無束，他人亦亳無戒心，常爲傳播疾病之主要來源，比習傳染病管理者，所不可不特別致意者也。　　（三）貯菌動物—貯帶病菌之動物甚多，但一般野獸飛禽之與人類社會不發生密切關係者，並無重要性可言；換言之，傳染病中之貯菌動物，槪以家畜家禽爲主。然而，鼠類雖非吾人所存心豢養，却最愛接近人類，是故亦爲主要的咛菌動物焉。　　凡上所述皆爲病源，使各病菌不具有相當之傳染力及毒力，固無論矣；即具備之，而不由適常之途徑，以侵入人體，亦不足以產生傳染病。茲論其第二個要素—播種。　　二　播種—傳染途徑及方法　　病菌之侵襲人體，其途徑不一，昔人謂「病從口入」。實際上豈僅一口已哉！下表可示傳染、途徑之概觀、　　除昆蟲傳染性貿特殊外，大抵直接或間接的接觸每爲一般傳染之主要方法，傳染最烈之疾病，多爲呼吸道之泡沬傳染；腸胃道傳染病之有腹瀉症狀者，其傳染力自亦甚大；若天昆蟲傳染，則多與節季有關，此其大槪也。在上表所列各種傳染途徑中，以呼吸道傳染，腸胃道傳染，及昆蟲傳染二者爲最普通而重要。茲分論之：　　（一）呼吸道傳染　　空氣傳染—昔人對於空氣傳染，頗爲恐怖，今已知其不甚可能，蓋據實騐證明，病者呼出之空氣，恒不含任何病菌也。即傳染最劇天花，流行性感留之類，其傳染亦多賴有直接或間接之接觸而後可，故今日之實施病休隔離於患者，但使與外界斷絕一切接觸，便足收防制之效，不復似昔日之迷信採用空間隔離矣。但空氣中所含之汚染的埃　及泡沫，則可爲傳病之媒，是又不可不知者也。</p>

<p>春秋談愛倫坡  劉會慰　　愛倫坡Elgar　Allanpoe是美國文學史上一個驚人的天才，可是他一生潦倒不堪。早年的時候，因爲他好賭博與飲酒，被佛及尼亞大學開除了學籍。後來在西點地方，又被軍法從事，驅逐出境，因爲他應該執着槍上操塲去演習的時候，不顧一切法規的坐在他房間中寫詩。　　坡幼年早孤，爲一姻葉富商所領養。最後，道一個　商也把他的義子趕走了，遺囑上並不留給他一個錢。、坡的婚姻在文學史上是一個最美麗的故事。他的妻子佛及尼雅克萊，是他最長的表妹。他們婚後，非常窮苦。坡飲着烈性的生酒。他的妹妹是發瘋了。有人說坡也是一半瘋狂的。他的年紀比他的妻子大上一倍。當時他是廿六歲，而她不過十三歲。猜想起來，他們的婚姻一定要得惡果的，可是事實上，却是一個成功的羅曼史。坡非常愛他的孩子似的妻子，因了這永生的愛，他寫成了幾首英文中不朽的詩。　　坡的詩和小說，都是文學中的珍品，可是他却不能以此換得麵包。他的「烏雅」一書，繼續不斷的寫了十年，他賣去的時候只得了十元美金，—一年的工作値一元美金。　　在紐的的葛賴得康高司Grand　Conconurse地方，有着一間茅屋，便是坡和他的妻子居住的地方。當九十餘年前，坡租這茅屋的時候，這是一個即將傾圯的破屋。現在它四周是被公寓園繞着了。不過那時這茅屋的所在還是鄕村。它隱現於蘋果樹的中間。當春天到來的時候，空氣裏充滿了櫻桃花的香氣，和密蜂的嗡嗡聲。這是一個美麗的似夢一般的境界。　　坡租住這一間茅屋，每月的房金，是三元錢。然而這區區的三元坡還是付不出。往往他是不付租金的。他的妻子却患着肺病。他甚至不能替她購備食物。有時候，他們一連好幾天沒有一些東西吃下。當蒲公英在院子裏開花的時候，他們就採了一些，把來煮熟了，吃蒲公英花。一天天這樣的挨過去。　　當鄰居們發現坡和他的妻子，眞要餓死的時候，他們送一些食物給他們，眞是太可憐了。可是他有做詩的天才，她是多情的種子，他們雖然貧苦，却是非常的快樂。　　佛及尼亞不久在那裘死了。她死的前數月，睡在一條草蓆上，沒有足够的衣被，使她溫暖。當她太冷的時候，她的母親替她擦手，坡替她擦足，他把他在西點地方穿的一件舊軍服、蓋在她戰慄的身上，到了夜裏，他哄他的貓去睡在她的足旁。　　當她死了之後，坡沒有錢營葬。要是沒有鄰人的資助，她也許要送到義塚上去了。　　佛及尼亞是在一月裏死去的。幾個月後，春天來了，月兒在蘋果樹上升起，星兒在西邊天際炯爍，坡坐着，懷念他的佛及尼亞。由於這懷念，他寫成了一首最美麗的情詩：　　皎潔的月兒，　　帶給我美麗的伊人的夢；星光燦爛，　　好像是伊人明眸的顧盼。我終夜睡在伊人的旁邊，　　伊是我的愛人，我的生命，我的新娘，伊在海邊的墳墓中，　　那潮聲潺潺的海邊的墳墓中。鬻歌  朱顏　　「春秋配」上塲了，這本來是面黃肌瘦的女孩，側着身閃出門帘。一個暴雷似的彩聲，冲着她叫着。現在她是給滿臉的油彩、木炭、胭脂，加上她原來的美麗的輪廊，裝成了一個古典的美人。已經是一個半成熟的女孩子，懂得了一點愛和憎，演過幾百塲不同性格的戲，她絲亳不顯得慌亂，跟，　機械的塲面：「大，大，大，的的大，大，」遵守一個絕對的尺度，輕盈而妖嬈地移着脚步，走到那閃耀着數不淸的電炬的合口。　　飄洒地甩一下水袖，細心地念起引子。聲音確實是她們本行認爲好本錢的聲音，雖然是尖銳了一點，但尾音却有搖曳的裊裊韻味。「好呀—」一個特別拖長的，帶着撩撥性的彩聲，使她的心震　了一下，不得不向那聲音方向投射了一個驚奇的眼光。那兒，一個滿臉汕汗的短肥的傢伙正出神地咧茄嘴，許多看客也震於這吶喊的好嗓，大家朝他看着。及至這高與高彩烈的傢伙發覺射來了戲中人的眼線，便不似思索地怪聲吼起來：「吆—吆！」於是，監個的小戲館的人們都樂開了，到處是歡樂的笑。　　這就是人們忙亂着擠軋着上戲館的理由。一個精彩的塲面過去了，人們嗑瓜子，喝茶，閉談；再等待一個上下合演的精彩演出。人們就是這樣丟失了心似的陶醉着；放走了　想和靈魂，暫短地愉樂自己。　　女孩鎭靜着心，一步一步扮演着戲。這時那做晚娘的小丑却引起來她的同情。這塗着白鼻頭的枯瘦人物裝起惡人說話，咬牙切齒地實在顯得吃力。頸頃上的一條粗粗的筋暴突着，頸和肩間生的一個紅腫的搶，更因了肌肉的抽動就要裂開來了。「唉唉，你　的什麼命！」女孩　樣天眞地想。然而當這丑角拿起家法兇狠地向她鞭打時，她却有了痛　的　實的感覺。「喂呀—」她哭起來了，抽動兩肩，如同眞的一樣。常她唱到「兒的娘呀」的時候，一串串的淚珠就掛上她塗滿油彩的雙頰！　　她不是在做戲了，她是在盡情地哭。控訴着小心靈的悲哀和悒　。再沒有比這更痛快的事了，在台上，她才有機會給自己任情地憤恨和感傷。因此她雖然十幾歲的年紀，却對悲劇有了偏愛；雖然强顏的歡笑，可以博得更多更　的彩聲。　　然而她也不會悲傷得過了分，忘記了在唱戲。那些塲面和配角，都不時有意或無意地提醒了她；更大的原因，就是她在搬演人生的時候，一雙兇惡而嚴厲的眼睛，也一直在監察着她。即上塲門的門帘後面，不是老有一雙鷹似眼睛盯着她嗎？那是屬於一個肥得像猪的女人的，她就是永遠　着無情的家法的寄媽。　　這女孩是懂得一點愛和憎的。第三塲的風流瀟洒的小生，又給了她的眞實感。她是需要一點愛的滋潤的了，作爲這同台的脚色，是實在的溫存和漂亮的人吧，她羞澀地低了頭，背誦那古老的談愛的詞令，試行游泳到從未到過的愛之河里。這是非常動人的！人們激賞着，不喊的人也叫了，像得到了滿足。　　當這女孩無知地飄飄然的時候，一句唱詞無意地走了樣，這是一種無可挽救的錯誤。打鼓的皺了一下眉毛牽就了一下。拉弦子的立即給了她一個「螺　」—他是老師呢，別瞧這滿臉鬼氣的傢伙，他有的是敎這一套的能耐。她驚覺了，又重回到演戲的眞實，一句一動，小心翼翼地唱終了塲。　　等卸了妝，拿熱水抹了臉，才穿好半舊的花布長褂，一個堅實的粗重的熱辣辣的巴掌便打上她還是黃黃的瘦瘦的面頰。　　「你媽格　，笨虫！一句南梆子都走了板！你拿三十萬，你丟你　的一輩子的人！」那肥猪樣的女人咆哮着，揮舞　手。　　女孩委屈着，習慣地鼓着嘴，她想說：「我只拿一萬呀！二十九萬是你們拿的，」「我會唱的！我不奔，我是…」然而她不可能說出來。鷹的眼睛是那樣兇惡地瞪着她，而她，確實像一只瑟縮的小鷄了。她把委屈吞咽下去　，忍着滿眼的太多的淚。　　「好呀！」前台又轟起狂潮了，是投向另一個登塲的女孩。　　她們就是這樣度過了好多好多的年華！談藝術批評  顏文樑　　創作與批評，在　術上占着同樣重要的地位。創作者可以僅憑個人的環境，個性和時代背景等，直覺地表　出一種　　米，而　術討論案則不僅於一種藝術，而更重要的具備多種條件和多種學問，用不同方式的角度，以評衡，以準　。換一句話說：藝術家只是把意念發表出來，結晶出來，而　術評論家則純粹是藝術家的發言人；或者更近乎借鑑的指導者。所以假使說，批評者的修養，比創作家還要難過萬倍，倒也並不是虛語。　　誰都承認藝術隆盛的條件，當然大部份要傑出的藝術家的產生；但另外一個條件，假使沒有批評家的鼓勵和督促，往往無從使藝術達於更精湛更理想的境城。勒斯京RUSKIN壯麗精當的藝術評論，在歐洲藝壇上，握住了一個有力的中心，至少限度他的言論，影響到幾個時代而沒有變更。最高的批評，絕不顧慮到藝術表現的方法和技巧，而祇於藝術作品所給予每個人的感應而決定的。　　當然，創作者有時由於單純的個人印象，而興起的一種情感，刻劃在藝術上，率直地或者一無裝飾地，往往通過批評者的鍛鍊而加以畳化，或者更前裁出更富於情感，這種情感，或者比創作者更不能表達出來，這是很可能的事。所以達文西那幅「晚餐圖」在某一個時期，幾乎被燬滅，但終於爲不可磨滅的一種　術評論的價值而克保至今。　　藝術評論家，幾乎就是一種藝術。而且更精深地把俗眼所看見的世界，建起一座美麗的樂園，詩人朗飛洛在他到了羅馬後，他　麗的詩篇，充滿着許多雋永的對藝術感到滿足而歌詠，而讚賞。米　的那幅荷　的農夫，那個粗野的男子，要是不被詩人　克哈姆的讚嘆，誰也不會注意到世上有着這樣的村夫，而那幅名作，也會被人忽略的。　　藝術評論家應該打破一切成見，推翻一切典型的，尺度可以量出每一種物件的定性，但用於藝術，多少有點把某一種尺度所限，一有典型的觀念，往往容易走人定型性。昔袁子才論詩，說得好：「詩者，各人之性情耳，與唐宋無與也。」定型不一定是壞的，但容易走入「故步自封」，是很自然的事。因爲藝術的門徑，決不限於一途的，王充在他的自紀篇中，曾說：「百夫之子，不同父母，殊類而生，不必相似，各有所稟，自爲佳好。」藝術正是有這種現象的。殊類而生，不必相似，祗要各有所稟。所以藝術評論家，應該拋棄一己的尺度，那或者也是很重要的。　　具備藝術評論家的條件，當然不祗一途，其他如敏銳的感覺，和潛心的修養，也是許多重要條件之一。更有如善良的意志和高潔的胸懷，也是爲一個眞實的藝評家所必具的條件。使何論批評那一種藝術，即使是不洽批評者個人的意志的，也誠摯的指出他的疵誤，拋棄人我憎惡的觀念，而使接受的如逢老友那樣的親切愉快，那樣地結果，一切　術才入於正道常軌，而藝術的隆盛也可期望的。秋雨  鄭震木刻工作頌  楊謀　　工作，工作，血管中注入了新的活力，這，簡單的筆劃，是多麼地激動，誘惑，影響着我。　　撇去了工作，人生就只是渣滓。沒有了工作，人生就只像是失了譜的七弦琴，庸俗，零亂，紛擾，乏味。停止了工作，整個生命的意義不也倏然巾斷了嗎？　　工作會拖累着我，但是，失了神的眼眶裏，充塞的却是愉快的光輝。疲倦會陣陣的襲來，無窮的信心却在替我支撐。工作包羅了快樂，它啓示生命的道路。　　世界上再沒有痛苦，比沒有工作是更大的了。總之是，無聊，無聊，無聊，……　　沒有一個人不是對自己有着抱負，懷着希望的吧，工作就是媒介，沒有了工作，一切只是幻象，一切都是虛空。工作公平地表揚着每一個人，它鐫刻下每個人辛動和疏懶。　　工作鼓起了每個人的活力，工作保證了世界的不會滅亡。人類在前進，世界在進步，因爲，有了工作，工作創造了溫暖，陰霾的空氣不是都一廓而淸了嗎？　　工作，每個人不是都在頌讚嗎？明知道，一切的工作都會帶來疲乏和辛勞，但是，誰又畏縮不前呢？一寸山河一寸血  葉勁風18　　在當時緊張局面之下，我也顧不到這是事實還是幻景，祗是想到第二步動作。　　「咱們走吧，老伯？」仍舊是一個孩子的聲音。　　「不行，咱們得把這兩個傢伙搬到車上，送到前面那個小河裏去。」這是我在事前計劃的後一部分。前一部分，當然還想靠着我那校手槍，用練習過的準確手段，把兩人射殺。可是照已經發生的事實看，我的計劃，也許爲失敗；因爲這兩個隊伙，已經先發制人了。至多，我們和對方，也祗能辦到一個機會均等，換句話，要不是小老虎的行動，道等剽疾迅捷，把我闖在一邊，也許我可以打中他們兩個，而我和小老虎也許要各吃他們一顆子彈哩。　　我的後一部分計劃實行之後，我又把車子開回頭；駛過了剛才激鬥的地點，不到半里，便將速度減低。我和小老虎，一　下車；而車子仍向前面自由行動；跑了不多遠，自己轉向田野裏面去了。　　這時候大約是農歷六月初八九，本來應當有月亮，但雲層相當厚，仍舊看不淸楚什麼，只辨得出脚前的路徑。爲了避免巡哨的囉哆，只得捨了公路，揀隱僻的田野，朝準火錢稀疏的地方走着。緊張的神經，漸次恢復了常態。　　的莫走了半小時，認爲已經避開了火綫，和共他危險，這才揀了一個小墳堆脚坐下。　　「東西都拿了」我想起我的手槍，和小老虎的口袋。　　「咱們的東西？……都在這兒」。像變魔術似的，小老虎從褲帶上摸出了我的手槍，從身後提出來那寳貝布口袋，仍是飽飽的一口袋，「還得了兩樣玩意兒。」說着，又抽出了剛才用過的手電筒，還有一柄小刀—一柄相當精緻的日本小囊子。　　「這槍？」我接過手槍來，想問他甚麼時候拾到的。　　「咱們把那兩塊料挪到車頂上的當兒，我在前輪子旁邊拾到的，隨手撳在腰裏，忘了！」　　「咱們不是早把燈擰減了嗎？」我疑心他怎麼能看得淸楚—槍是黑的，地上的土，也是黑的。　　「再黑點我也瞧得見，我爺爺說我有夜貓子眼—天生的。」　　「瞧瞧現在幾點哪，」我要試試他這雙特別眼睛，拿手腕子翻過來，給他瞧我的手表。　　「八點四十……分。」　　我把他那個戰利品手電筒，拿過來照了一下，果然一點不差。我想到這孩子的一雙黑多白少的大眼珠子，似乎是一種異稟。可是從前念生現學的時候，不記得有這一條。也許這是例外的例子，沒有記戰　　「那麽，你晚上走道，不是同白天一樣？」驚訝和好奇心理混在一起了。</p>

<p>自由談要讀書  少夫　　塘沽路第十六國民學校被學生搗毀，我們不能等閒看過，這一事件裏面所包合的嚴重性。　　學生搗毀該校的原委是這樣的—　　私校學費高昂，該校規定不收學費，因此報名投考之新生，竟達二千二百餘人，學校當局，除將舊生六百人予以繼續外，餘額僅三百餘名，昨日發榜錢取新生三百餘人，但尚有一千九百人榜上無名，於是聯合向錢校長要求「我們大家要讀醫，請校長帮帮忙；」但因敎室容量以及經費等問題，未能接受，於是發生一幕搗毀劇。　　學生行動容許鹵莽，但動機不能不承認是純正的。倘使這問題敎育當局不急謀有效的辦法，恐此類事件不僅發生在第十六國民學校而已。　　我們曾一再呼籲私校的學費太昂貴，也曾請求當局注意莘莘學子入校無門的徬徨徘徊的痛苦；畢竟能入私立學校肄業的是少數有錢人家的子弟，而讓敎育成爲貴族的專有權利，也決不是當局所能緘默的，當局倘不能將敎育普及於大衆，這不僅失職，而且是罪惡，造成社會一切罪惡的罪惡。　　敎育經費拮据是根本的原因，而在紙醉金迷的大上海，竟讓學生無學校可讀書，作爲上海人是該覺得羞恥的；尊師運動雖結束，貸學金的徽募還在繼續進行，有錢的朋友，除你們自己的子弟外，能不能爲他人的子弟設想一下，拿點錢出來哩—　　我們要擴大貸學金運動，別以爲自己的子弟能有學校可進，倘使那大多數的失學靑年憤激遷怒而願同關於盡—大家都沒有學校可進，豈是社會之福？　　除此之外，我們還貢獻一點意見，上海市各學校，無論公立，或私立，能不能各增設夜校呢？（與日校同等課程與學歷）這樣，敎室容量問題不是可以解決了嗎？　　總之，我們決不能忽視此事，更不能用官僚手段敷衍此事。新秋偶感  高武弘　　夏曳着尾巴懶懶地去了，繼之而來的是秋。「西風起，碧雲天，黃花地，北雁南飛。」對着眼前的景物，眞覺得百感交集。天氣雖然還熱，窮人却已在担憂着寒衣了；「全家都在西風裏，九月衣食未剪裁！」　　中秋節又快來了，各式各樣的月餅站在食品公司的橱窗裏向，　人投　驕傲的目光，似乎說：誰有力量來把我搬回去！」月餅小姐，你別得意忘形，搬你回去的人，他是要吃掉你的，倒是終日徘徊在橱窗前，對你流着設延的人，他們纔在仔細欣賞你的方委，日日夜夜地想念着你。　　「中國飢餓，上海跳舞，」　但跳舞而已，簡直是一片「昇平氣象。」這「昇平」是不是少數人紛師出來的呢？你能說不嗎？爲了救濟難民選舉「小姐」，「是后」之後，這一套把戲居然又　外國人採用了。華納公司廿適紀念時，預備在上海舉辦「標　夫文競賽。並免費招待全市年　雙十的少女觀據，選舉「標準美女」的時期，筆者預測，大概在今年的雙十節；囚爲華納公司國祝的是廿周紀念，應選得少女又是年　雙十，三個雙十，當然要　在一起。　　這樣一來，已經選出的「上海小姐」，「皇后一就有疑問了。　　選舉「樑準美女」之後，一九四大年的大上海，不知還有什麽花樣玩出來？　　上海都市計劃以二十五年爲對象，五十年爲準備。眞是偉大極了！　　人家有五年計劃，十年計劃，我們單只一個建設大上海計劃，就是五十年，足使人家的五年計劃、十年計劃，黯然失色。　　爲什麽不索性定了一百年呢，「百年大計，」不更好嗎？中國有許多「第一流學者，」不是常在說：「我的計劃，一百年後一定能够實現。」「我的著作，一百年後，一定風行全世界。」嗎？　　人心　悲，禮義喪失，人與人之間的義氣，還不如一條狗，所以要用狗來重振人心了。若謂不信，驚看「義犬救主」的廣吿。那上面不是有：「有功世道，激勸人心。使你感動得流出眼淚來！」等字樣嗎？　　話劇廣吿，居然也電影化起來了，五彩片的賣座好，於是「孔雀胆」的廣吿，就來上一個「五彩綺麗豪華絕代哀　凄凉歷史悲劇，」爲什麽不說七彩十彩呢不必跑馬  佐萋　　假使把上海比作一個人體的話，除了黑色的蘇州河像一條潰爛的盲腸外，那麼，跑馬應將是上海的肺臟。　　人身的健康與吾，有賴於肺部的健全，關係極大，我們要不使上海的肺　腐爛，所以切盼市政當局，對於跑馬應重行賽馬的申請，鄭重考慮，而對於改關爲公園一事，希望能從速實行！　　事關市民公益，也不算小—商標  恨忻　　報載：八月廿六日下午三時四十分，有一病倒退伍士兵由黃浦分局巡官査見，用公事車載送仁濟醫院，當時該院以病房無空榻拒絕收受，乃改送廣慈醫院，也遭同樣拒却，再送紅十字會醫院，仍被以床位客滿見拒，最後送往宏恩醫院也託故拒絕，轉輾往來，東奔西投，時已夜晚八時，此衣服襤褸之重病士兵，走遍上海各大醫院，竟無緣得醫藥救洽，且經長途顚簸，遂死於警局公事車上。　　醫院以沒有空床位爲理由，拒絕收受重病者，這與收受虛以療養爲名，實將醫院病房富旅館的人比較，眞是一個强烈的對照；又，醫院即使收受任何需要急救的病者，必須將手續費預先一次付淸，方肯開始動手術，從這兩件事看來，可見「金錢」的魔力眞大。　　所以，我認爲，以後醫院不必再以紅十字爲記，不妨以「孔方兄」作商標。我理想的夫人  芝薇　　我攻讀的是化學，因爲投奔在祖國懷抱的一個偏僻小山城裏，所以只是默默無聞地放過了我的學府過程。平淡的四年，我竟不曾談過戀愛，相信：這全是因爲生活不安定，引不起找愛興緻的緣故。最近，同事們總喜歡打趣我這個「光棍」，因之，我感到需要以「找愛的對象」來應付他們；今天我擬了幾項關於我未來夫人的應有資格，坦白地寫出來：　　我對未來夫人的理想，一點也不苛求；下面幾點將使妳明白：妳會不會是我理想中的伴侶。你—　　（一）曾受十年以上的教育，而對人生觀抱有不斷地向上性。　　（二）能够平心靜氣地處理大小事情。　　（三）認爲對生活的希望，應該次第地踏上「眞·善·美」的階段，而絕無虛榮上的企求。　　（四）面貌不必動人，只需看了不討厭。（客觀地）　　（五）不嗜姻酒·麻將、撲克、有時間需要消磨時，願意把它全部化在書報和運動，正當娛樂上面。（六）有愛好淸　的習慣；但不常施脂粉，染塗蔻丹唇膏，把頭髮燙卷成飛機或其他的式樣。　　（七）不穿花綠眩目的服裝；以爲藍布旗袍一件，半高跟皮鞋一雙，作通常服飾最爲舒適。　　（八）能够理家，稍有設計或佈置狹小房間的天才。　　（九）有旅行的愛好。　　假使妳自信上面幾點對妳並無相違的地方，而妳亦有意和我交誼往來，那末，請妳想一想，妳將用什麽方法來使我和妳相識；這，妳必須運用妳智巧！補白  希賢　　我們依動力而生存，如果你停止前進，你就完了。—Smedely　D．Bufler　　每個人底敎育裏最好而最重要的一部是他給予他自己的。—Gibbon　　每個人是他自己的祖先，也是他目己的後嗣，他開拓自己的未來，繼承自己的過去。—H．F．Edge（譯自Par　ade）福爾摩斯　從那里來　（）  斯道哀著　郁　強釋　　約瑟夫。幷耳諸如此類的推論，在其他的文章中也有很多的紀錄。柯南。道爾的愛丁堡大學同學瓊斯醫生回憶着：　　「諸位，這人有什麽病疼？」拜耳突然詢問站在他身傍戰慄着的學生。「下米，你，看看他。不，你必須不觸到他。用你的眼睛，—用你的耳朶，用你的腦子，用你的衝擊的感覺，用你的推論的能力！」　　那訥訥的學生盡了最大的能力說：「股部關節症，先生？」　　「股部並沒有毛病！」拜耳嫌惡的回答。「這個人的跛行不是由於股部的原因，僅是由於他的脚，更可說由於他的一雙脚。你可會仔細的留意到那雙鞋上用刀割開的裂縫，這裂縫所在，是鞋子對脚壓力最大的部份。他是生了雞眼，諸位，股部完全沒有病疼。但是他並不是來叫我們醫治鵝眼的，諸位，我們並不是扦脚者。他的煩惱比這更嚴重。這是侵性中酒精毒的病症，諸位。赤紅的鼻子，腫脹的臉，充血的眼睛，顫抖的手，痙舉的面部肌肉、加上快速，悸動且顯　的動脈，這一切吿訴我們是如此。但是這些推論，諸位，必須用絕對且具體的証據去証實。這一個例子，我的診斷是由病人右手衣袋中伸出的威士忌酒瓶的瓶頓頓証實的。」　　對另一個病人，他有一次說：諸位，我們這裏有一個人，他不是切軟木的就是鑿石頭的，假如你稍爲用一下你的眼睛，你就能够看到在他的食指的一邊有一塊些微硬的胼胝，而在姆指的外側有較厚的一塊；「一個確然的標誌，他不做前一行、就幹後一有。」　　還有一次，他發來他的觀察：「一個漁夫—你們留意，雖然現在是　天，氣候非常熱，可是這病人却穿着畏統靴。當他坐在椅子上時，道靴子就被淸楚的看到了。除了水手，這種季節沒有人穿長統靴。他的臉晒成黃褐色指出他是一個海岸綫的水手，並不是到外洋的深海水手。他的黃褐的皮色僅是由一種氣候造成的—還是本地的皮色。一把刀鞘露出在他的上裝下面，是這一帶漁夫們所用的那一種。他還藏着一團姻草在他嘴內較深的一隅，弄得非常熟嫻呢。諸位，這此推論的總結就是他是一個漁夫。更進一步証明我的診斷的正確性，當一陣魚的腥味報道他的到達非常題著而刺激，我注意到許多魚鱗黏附在他的身服和手上。連環漫畫　三毛從軍記（八九）  張樂平作原子老虎  小民作</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] Discussions regarding the reorganization of the National Government Committee are showing signs of progress. It is reported that the selection of the five-person group has been decided. From the government side, the two members are Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, and Zhang Lisheng, Minister of the Interior. The two members from the Communist Party are Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu. The American side is represented by Ambassador Stuart, with Special Envoy Marshall not participating.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] The government has recently agreed to the proposal by Ambassadors Marshall and Stuart to reorganize the National Government Committee and has decided to establish a five-person group to conduct discussions. After some progress is made, the matter will be handed over to the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) Comprehensive Group to study issues concerning the reorganization of the government. The idea of this small group meeting was proposed as early as when Marshall was in China, but it did not gain the Chairman's approval. After obtaining approval, both sides immediately began discussing the selection of personnel on the 29th. The government decided on Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng. However, this has not been finally approved by the Chairman, so many reporters who learned of this news have been cautious and have not published it immediately. According to reliable sources, the Chairman has agreed to the two representatives and summoned them to Guling on the 30th to carefully discuss the content of the upcoming small group meeting. They are scheduled to return to Nanjing on September 2nd, and the meeting will commence on the 3rd. The meeting will be chaired by Ambassador Stuart, and the topics for discussion, according to the Communist Party, are roughly the following: (1) The distribution of seats on the National Government Committee; (2) Discussion on changing the one-third veto power in the Outline for Peaceful National Reconstruction.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] Representatives of the government to the PCC held a meeting at Secretary-General Wu's residence on Ling Road at 6:00 PM on the 29th.

<p>[Reuters Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] Canadian Ambassador Major General Odlum issued a statement on the 29th denying that he had, at the request of Special Envoy Marshall, explained anything to Chairman Chiang. He stated: "If I had said or done any part of what is described in that report, the Canadian government would consider me to have overstepped my authority and would recall me." "If I were engaged in political activities, it would not be on behalf of the Kuomintang, nor on behalf of the Communist Party, but on behalf of the people of China. The fate of China rests in the hands of Chairman Chiang, Zhou Enlai, Marshall, and Stuart. I understand and admire the talents and patience of these gentlemen, and I have great confidence in them, but I am not within their circle. My position is the same as the general public, merely occupying a small seat in the front row of the audience. I can applaud, and I have indeed applauded, but I must not step onto the stage. If I did not have admiration and love for the Chinese people, and deep friendship with some of the leaders, I would have already packed my bags and returned home. I am staying here because I believe that the development of China has a significant impact on the entire world, including Canada." Previously, Odlum also stated: "My task is that of a researcher and observer, standing in the position of a friend. Although I have close personal relationships with leaders of all factions in China, I do not intend to participate in Chinese politics, nor do I have the authority to participate."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] According to Reuters Nanjing, the British Prime Minister Attlee's personal representative in China, Wyatt, has denied reports in the Chinese press that Britain will participate in the new peace talks between the Chinese government and the Communist Party.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Guling Dispatch, 29th] British Prime Minister's personal representative General Wyatt left Guling in the morning of the 29th for Xunyang and then flew to Nanjing.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Convening the National Assembly; The Communists Still Oppose <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] CCP Spokesperson Wang Bingnan stated: If Chairman Chiang convenes the National Assembly on November 12th without first establishing a coalition government, the CCP will convene leaders in the CCP-controlled areas in Yan'an to discuss the second step of action. Yan'an opposes the unilateral convening of the National Assembly and the adoption of a constitution, and believes that this move is an attempt by the government to politically divide the country. Until now, all political institutions in the Communist areas belong to local governments, because we hope for a unified coalition and have not established a central government. If the government proposes to convene the National Assembly before the cessation of hostilities and excludes the CCP, we are prepared to convene a meeting of all border area governments in response. What Mr. Wang said is sufficient to prove the rumour that if the government insists on convening the National Assembly before the resolution of major issues such as peace talks and government reorganization, Yan'an will consider establishing a separate CCP central government.</p>

It is reported that recently, Mao Zedong specifically provided his subordinates with four key points regarding the current situation: (1) Launch offensives; (2) Advocate for peace; (3) Be proactive in advancing; (4) Negotiate passively. At the same time, the CCP also gave its subordinates four instructions: (1) Launch a comprehensive offensive and conduct localized negotiations; (2) Consolidate the Northeast, expand into the Northwest, and make every effort to advance into the provinces of Suiyuan and Shanxi; (3) Use the Northeast as the strategic outer perimeter of the revolution and North China as the source of the revolution; (4) Unite all revolutionary forces, overthrow the notification of imperialism, and skillfully use the method of armed uprising by the masses to seize power.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Xuzhou Dispatch, 29th] Military sources report that the National Army in northern Jiangsu entered Sucheng County Town at 2:00 PM on the 29th. The Communist army is collapsing towards the northeast.</p>
<p>[Our Taixian Dispatch, 29th] The Communist army that attacked Baimi Town did indeed enter the urban area for a time, but has been repelled by the National Army. Fighting is still ongoing near the town. The Communist army that attacked between Qutang and Haian has been repelled by the National Army and is collapsing. The Qutang-Haian Highway has also been repaired by the authorities, but traffic on the Jiangqu Highway has been temporarily suspended due to damage by the Communist army.</p>
<p>[Our Jiangdu Dispatch, 29th] The Communist army facing the Xiannv Temple in Yangzhou launched a small-scale harassment today, which may be a prelude to a large-scale offensive. Also, there has recently been Communist army activity in the southwest area of Shaobo Lake. According to refugees who escaped from Shaobo, Qiaoshe, and other places, the Communist army is currently carrying out large-scale massacres in these areas. The so-called "pro-government" people, including women and children, are not spared. In Liujiazhuang alone, there were more than 300 people. Their methods of killing are appalling. One person, after being arrested, was pushed into a cesspool and soaked for about half an hour. They were then taken out and forced to look at cotton clothes under the hot sun. This was repeated again and again. The victim screamed in agony, and the Communist army took pleasure in this.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 29th] According to military authorities, the situation in Rehe is quite serious. The executive group in Chengde has lost contact with the Military Mediation Department. Although the power supply in the city has been destroyed by the Communist army, it does not affect the group's use of dry-cell-powered electrical equipment, so it is difficult to judge whether there is a problem with the group. For this reason, the US proposed yesterday to send a plane to Chengde to make contact. The Communist side said that because the situation was serious, they could not guarantee the safety of the plane. However, the US finally sent a plane yesterday with government personnel on board. As of 6:00 PM this evening, there has been no news of its return. The US side of the Military Mediation Department inquired as to why the Communist army destroyed the power supply in Chengde. The Communist side replied that not only this, but everything in Chengde would be destroyed. It is reported that there were originally three regiments of Communist troops in the city of Chengde, but the current number is unclear. Some people say that it will not be difficult for the National Army to recover Chengde, but the fate of Chifeng, the second key point in Rehe, is also uncertain. Communists are now jokingly saying that the Chifeng issue, which Marshall considered to be a masterpiece, was resolved at the beginning of the Military Mediation Department, but today's Chifeng issue may be the end of the Military Mediation Department. Zheng Dongguo and Da Wang, a member of the Northeast Political Committee, both arrived in Chaoyang on the 27th. With the progress of the military, the politics of the Mongolian banners will also have significant developments. Da Wang will also make a trip to Pingquan. Wan Guobin, the director of the Jinzhou Railway Bureau, also arrived in Lingyuan on the 28th to plan and supervise the repair of the railways along with the army, as well as the Pingquan to Yebai Chifeng line. The Jin-Cheng Railway has been repaired to Shuiquan west of Lingyuan and can be repaired to Pingquan recently. The Ye-Chi line can also be repaired in the short term.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency Beiping Dispatch, 29th] A spokesman for the CCP delegation issued a statement in Shanghai denying the attack on Datong. The Beiping Headquarters specifically refuted this. According to a spokesman for the Headquarters, the Communist army attacked Datong Ying County from the beginning of July, mobilizing tens of thousands of troops. The defending troops in the two places have been besieged for more than a month. The fighting has been brutal. The Communist army has also repeatedly fired artillery shells into the city after occupying Qilicun and Baimacheng. Residents have also been injured and killed. This is an undeniable fact, and yet the CCP spokesman still says that they did not attack Datong, trying to cover it up. This kind of self-deceiving tactic that violates the facts is really unwise. The Headquarters has decided to publish the details of the siege of Datong Ying County tomorrow (30th), which will further prove the CCP's consistent deception of the Chinese people.</p>

<h3 id="e19">New York Times Editorial Refutes Zhou Enlai's Explanation; Yan'an Imitates Soviet Policies Everywhere <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency New York Dispatch, 27th] The New York Times published an editorial today refuting Zhou Enlai's statement of the 26th, accusing the Chinese Communist Party of launching a propaganda war to force the United States to withdraw from China. The newspaper's editorial, titled "Propaganda Weapons in China," stated: "The new offensive of the Communist troops in the Northeast against the National Army, and the intensified fighting in several other areas, need not necessarily mean that China has been plunged into a full-scale civil war. This is part of the Communist Party's movement to force us to withdraw from China. All Communist spokesmen emphasize this point. Yan'an's current policy seems to have this as its main goal."</p>
<p>"Anyone can point out the parallel actions of the so-called 'peace front.' The steadfastness of the United States is being tested by tactics of aggression everywhere in Europe. Our interests there are in danger. The Communist Party in China also speaks of peace and accumulates some obstacles to peace, just as it does in Paris. Zhou Enlai in Nanjing is carefully maintaining his position in the talks and has not closed the door to further negotiations, while shifting the main responsibility for the breakdown of the talks to the United States. Mr. Zhou said that if we stop selling surplus supplies from the South Pacific to China, withdraw our troops, and end our support for the Chinese government, then peace talks may be reopened on a more reasonable basis. What Mr. Zhou calls 'reasonable' means strengthening Yan'an's position and infinitely weakening Nanjing's position." "Since the end of the war against Japan, the flames of war in China have been flashing from time to time, all related to the Communist Party's progress on the political front. Whenever the Communist Party is blocked, as it has been in the Northeast, the war will temporarily calm down. The Communist Party's renewed offensive in northern Jiangsu and the siege of Datong are both reactions to its political progress. In recent months, Yan'an has become closer to Moscow and has imitated Soviet policies everywhere. The Chinese Communist Party is currently using the most powerful propaganda weapons against the United States. This is very obvious."</p>

<p>Purchasing U.S. Surplus Materials: A Way for Sino-American Mutual Assistance</p>
<p>Spokesperson of the Central Propaganda Department Announces to Reporters</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] A Central News Agency reporter, concerning the central government's purchase of U.S. military surplus materials and the consultation on civil aviation matters, visited the spokesperson of the Central Propaganda Department, who stated the following: The purchase of U.S. military surplus materials has been under discussion for half a year and has been frequently reported in the newspapers; there is no secrecy involved. It is not cost-effective for the U.S. military to transport surplus materials from Pacific islands back to the United States, so they wish to sell them locally to China. The U.S. military in Europe also sold surplus materials to countries such as France and Italy. China, due to a shortage of materials, is willing to purchase them if the prices are low. It's a case of one side wanting to sell and the other wanting to buy. Rather than calling it U.S. aid to China, it would be better to call it Sino-American mutual assistance. As for the consultation on civil aviation, that is an entirely separate issue. This matter is still in the preliminary exploratory stage, and no agreement has been reached. If an agreement is reached in the future, it will definitely be based on complete equality and mutual benefit. During the international civil aviation conference three years ago, China had many reservations and was very cautious. The Chinese Communists are confusing these two unrelated matters, hence their immature and absurd statements.</p>
<p>Local Correspondences</p>
<p>Bankruptcy of Rural Areas in Northern Jiangsu; Central Government Emphasizes Agricultural Loans</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Correspondence] The Jiangsu Provincial Government previously drafted a plan to revive the entire rural area of Northern Jiangsu and requested an emergency agricultural loan of 10 billion yuan from the central government for Northern Jiangsu. It is now known that the Ministry of Finance has submitted the opinions signed and annotated by the Provincial Government to the Executive Yuan for discussion. The central government is deeply concerned about this, but due to the numerical issues, it is still under close study. However, this matter is expected to be approved, or at least a portion of the funds will be allocated for this purpose first.</p>
<p>Occupation of Airfield Without Payment; Supplementary Procedures for Compulsory Purchase to Be Handled</p>
<p>[Our Wujin Correspondence] The Haitang Township in the Second District of Xidamiao in this county originally encircled civilian farmland before the war to build an airfield. However, the area occupied was relatively small. After the fall of the area, the enemy greatly expanded it, forcibly occupying a large amount of civilian farmland and destroying eighteen nearby residential villages. After the victory, citizen representatives from the eighteen villages, including Zhou Chuanliang, repeatedly petitioned the authorities to return the land encircled for the airfield. Recently, the county government approved a statement from the Third Air Force Regional Command: "The Changzhou Airfield is currently in use and should be retained. In addition to separately telegraphing the Executive Yuan's temporary office in Shanghai, you are instructed to investigate and clarify the property rights. If the land for the airfield was occupied by the enemy or their puppets without paying the land price, the department will review and approve the price, jointly handle the supplementary procedures for compulsory purchase with the local government, and submit a report for approval."</p>

Since the victory, there has been a lack of National Army troops stationed there, leading to chaotic security conditions in the urban area and surrounding regions. The people are fearful, and no one dares to make constructive investments in industry and commerce. Robberies are reported daily in both urban and rural areas. First Pacification Commander Tang Enbo, recognizing the significant impact, plans to establish the Jing-Wu Garrison Command and the Wuhu City Defense Command in preparation. Tang plans to recommend the Deputy Commander of the 58th Army, Zhang Wenxin, for the position of commander of both commands. This may be realized in the near future. Furthermore, on the 24th, over a hundred armed bandits appeared in Dufeng Township, fifteen miles from the city in this county. Additionally, a gang of bandits, numbering over two hundred, also fled from the north bank of the Yangtze River to Yanzishan in Nanling, all carrying rifles and machine guns, extorting and killing people, causing great suffering to the people. The local authorities in each county are currently working together to suppress them.</p>
<p>Restoration of the Jinlan Highway; Traffic to Resume on September 1st</p>
<p>Ministry of Communications Approves Allocation of Funds for the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Correspondence] The person in charge of the Lan-Shou Road Restoration Project of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Transportation stated: "The highway from Lanxi, Magongtan, to Jinhua has now been completely restored and is scheduled to officially open to traffic on September 1st." Furthermore, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau, due to the construction costs for sections such as Zhuji, Jinhua, and Pingxiang exceeding the original budget significantly due to price increases, and the current operating income from the Hangzhou-Zhuji and Jiangshan-Raozhou sections being insufficient to cover expenses, Director Zhang Zilie personally went to Nanjing to request Minister Yu Dawei to increase the construction budget and allocate monthly funds. This has been approved, but the figures are still awaiting review by President Song Ziwen.</p>
<p>Hangzhou Clears Public Land</p>
<p>Much of Hangzhou's public land was illegally disposed of during the enemy and puppet occupation. After the city government's restoration, it began clearing the land based on the Provisional Regulations for Clearing Public Funds and Properties and the Regulations for Leasing Public Properties, and announced that all disposals during the enemy and puppet period were invalid. It is now known that the cleared public land in each district totals 2,207 mu. Those that meet the needs of municipal construction will be retained, with only short-term leases permitted. Leases for 1,701 mu of public land have already been granted, limited to self-cultivation and not for subletting for profit.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Rewarding the Elimination of Rice Borers by Exchanging Borers for Flour</p>
<p>The Suzhou-Ningbo Branch of the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), the head of the first agricultural work team stationed in Wuxi, Cheng Shouhua, recently decided to purchase rice borer eggs, moths, and withered ears of rice with goods to encourage people to eliminate rice borers. It is currently tentatively set at two catties of flour for one liang of rice moths, one catty of flour for three catties of withered rice ears, and one catty of flour for sixty egg masses. Recently, over three hundred bags of flour have been distributed in the Yanqiao area. On the 28th, another one hundred bags were transported to Liucang Township, and fifty bags were transported to Yanqiao. The work is very busy, but due to a shortage of personnel, a request has been made to the Construction Bureau to send technicians Wu and Zhao to Wuxi for assistance. The county government has also dispatched four police officers to maintain order in the townships. If any are found in the townships and towns of this county, they can be handled in the same way to promote the program widely.</p>
<p>Editorial: Prerequisites for Land Reform</p>
<p>Recently, there have been rumors that the government will implement a land reform policy to provide a good start for post-war rural reconstruction. This is naturally welcome news. Moreover, we believe that the fact that the National Government is only now "thinking about" land reform should be seen not as a new policy but as an "old tune," because today the land reform issue should not only be a problem that the government should "think about" but a problem that the government should actively "do."</p>
<p>It is said that Chairman Chiang is very concerned about this land problem and summoned Chen Guofu, Chairman of the Farmers Bank of China, and Li Shuming, General Manager, to Lushan to discuss how to proceed with the reform. President Song also mentioned this issue during his recent trip to Guling to seek instructions. The Central Standing Committee meeting on the 21st and the temporary discussion meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 22nd both discussed the implementation plan for this land reform. When President Song came to Shanghai last week, Minister Xu Kan of the Ministry of Food also came, further deepening the study of this issue. Furthermore, Xiao Zheng, Chairman of the China Land Administration Society, made specific suggestions to the central government, taking "land to the tiller" as the principle of implementation. We have heard this series of news and firmly believe that this urgent land reform issue will soon be transformed from an ideal into a reality due to the government's determination. For the sake of the lives of Chinese farmers, for the sake of Chinese agricultural production, and even for the future of China's industrialization and modernization, this is truly welcome news.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, we have not yet seen the central government's proposed plan for land reform. The content is unknown, so it is not appropriate to comment on it. However, this matter is of great importance and urgency. We would like to offer a few opinions on the prerequisites:</p>
<p>First, the government must recognize that land reform is proactive rather than reactive. What does this mean? Because "equalization of land ownership" is the main policy of the Kuomintang's Principle of People's Livelihood, "land to the tiller" is Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teaching, and the Land Law was promulgated by the National Government more than ten years ago and amended again in April of this year, with its implementation methods already announced. From any point of view, the National Government has no reason to postpone its implementation indefinitely. Furthermore, looking at the situation in rural areas before and during the war, the majority of self-cultivating farmers and tenant farmers in China, except for a few large landlords, are indeed suffering from the inability to make ends meet despite their hard work. The equalization of land rights is truly unavoidable. In the past, it could be said that the delay was due to the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, which was an extraordinary event; but now that victory has been achieved, the country's major reforms should be undertaken, and the government should especially start anew with the people. How can it not implement land reform in response to the current situation in rural areas? Therefore, since the government has this determination, it should proactively and positively shoulder the responsibility of implementing the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and implementing national policies, advancing bravely, persevering, and doing everything possible, and must not regard such a fundamental matter related to the livelihood of the people as some kind of reactive and decorative routine matter.</p>
<p>Second, the government's measures should be comprehensive rather than partial. What does this mean? Recently, there has been a saying that China is so large that a full-scale reform is too difficult, and land reform might as well be promoted first in the pacified areas, taking advantage of the situation. It is said that recently, after the National Army counterattacked in northern Jiangsu and advanced into some areas, the land issue became more prominent and urgently needed to be resolved in the pacified areas. In fact, the land issue is indeed as chaotic as tangled silk in areas that have been "liberated" by the Communists and urgently needs to be resolved, but shouldn't other areas, and even the whole of China, also seek appropriate solutions quickly? In recent years, Western political commentators have often said that the Chinese Communist Party is not truly implementing Marxism but only advocating the redistribution of land. Regardless of whether this statement is accurate, it shows that the necessity of reforming China's land has become a common consensus among economists at home and abroad. The National Government, as the only legitimate government of China, has the responsibility to implement government orders in any region of the country. If it believes that it is time to resolutely implement land reform, it should establish a comprehensive implementation plan. Although it can allow for some flexibility in phased and regional implementation to adapt to local conditions, there should be no preconceived notion of implementing it only partially when formulating the plan or program at the beginning. Otherwise, a big mistake will be made, and not only will the entire implementation disappear, but also the local implementation will add endless disturbances.</p>
<p>Third, the government must establish the authority of the executing agency and assign it the responsibilities it should bear when implementing this policy. Equalization of land rights is not a small matter, nor is it an easy task that can be done without any resistance. It requires great determination and great courage. The administrative and economic power of the executing agency should be established in the central government and even at the local level. The Land Administration Department has been established for many years. Although the scale is roughly complete, it is limited by its status and funds. The promotion of routine land administration still feels insufficient. If it is to be charged with implementing the policy of equalization of land rights, it may be beyond its power. In this regard, the central government should not only change the department to a ministry to show its determination to actively reform the land, but also establish land administration departments in all provinces and cities, set deadlines, and provide ample funding to ensure that all necessary tasks such as land declaration and land survey are completed within the prescribed period. Only then can a reasonable redistribution be based on the principle of land to the tiller. Not only this, but land reform not only contains the motive of equal distribution but also has the intention of promoting production. Only when the tiller has his own land will he be willing to work harder. This is one point. After the redistribution, new organizational methods such as "cooperative farms" and "collective farms" can be introduced as much as possible to gradually mechanize agriculture, and production can be increased. This is the second point. Because of this, in the process of land reform and in the improvement of agricultural production, the central and local governments must strengthen the status and strength of agricultural financial institutions and cooperative financial institutions, so that they can cooperate with the government's policies and implement them in a consistent manner. Only then can they hope to achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>In short, we believe that if the government wants to implement a "new policy," there will inevitably be some resistance. This is the case in ancient and modern times, at home and abroad. In ancient China, it can be said that the widespread implementation of land reform today is a major event, which is not easy to achieve and is within expectations. However, as long as the government recognizes that this matter is beneficial to the majority of the people—Chinese farmers account for 80 percent—as long as the government plans carefully in advance and executes impartially in the event, and as long as it adheres to perseverance from beginning to end, we believe that this land reform will be feasible in post-war China. Moreover, if China wants political stability, economic prosperity, and to become a modern country, frankly speaking, if it does not start with land reform quickly, all other new policy measures will be like rootless sesame grass and a fountain without a source.</p>
<p>The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference Meets Again</p>
<p>The foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union held another informal meeting yesterday at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss how to speed up the progress of the peace conference. Hopefully, this meeting of foreign ministers will not be as prolonged as the previous one.</p>
<p>The Paris Peace Conference has been open for thirty days, and we have only heard the grand pronouncements of representatives from various countries, who often argue until they are red in the face because of a disagreement. Apart from this, almost no progress has been made. Peace conference work is inherently difficult, and slow progress is not unexpected. Considering the mountain of amendments to the peace treaty proposed by representatives from various countries, it is indeed worrying. Regarding the draft peace treaty with Italy, there is almost no article that does not need to be amended. Assuming that these amendments are to be discussed and each representative is allowed to freely express his opinion, then the peace conference may not be able to "successfully conclude" by the end of this year. But can the objective international environment allow the peace conference to be delayed like this? First, the United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to open on September 23. Although some people advocate for the peace conference to be temporarily adjourned, others advocate for the United Nations General Assembly to be postponed, but in general, these two equally important international conferences are likely to be held simultaneously. However, if they are held simultaneously, international attention will inevitably be diverted, and the importance of the Paris Peace Conference will also be diminished. Second, the relations between Europe and the Far East are closely related. If the European stalemate cannot be broken, the Far East issue cannot be resolved soon. Therefore, for the sake of the future of the entire world, the Paris Peace Conference must speed up its work and complete its mission as soon as possible. The reopening of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference this time probably carries this important mission.</p>
<p>We have summarized the amendments to the draft peace treaty proposed by representatives from various countries, most of which focus on territorial demands: (1) Bulgaria demands the Serres region of Greece; (2) Greece demands a narrow strip of land in southern Bulgaria; (3) Greece demands the northern Epirus region of Albania; (4) Hungary wants to reclaim part of Outer Transylvania from Romania; (5) Abyssinia wants former Italian Somaliland in East Africa; (6) Austria demands South Tyrol from Italy; (7) Yugoslavia demands the Venezia Giulia region of Italy, including the port of Trieste. In addition, France also has territorial demands on Italy, and Egypt wants to cede a piece of territory from former Italian Libya. If these issues are to be discussed, the draft peace treaty drawn up by the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference will be completely overturned during the disputes and debates. In order to maintain the draft peace treaty, the four countries should reach an agreement on the amendments proposed by the representatives of the remaining seventeen countries so that they can adopt a common and consistent attitude. As for whether the four countries will accept the amendments that have been passed by each committee, it should also be decided at the Foreign Ministers' Conference, and at the same time, a spokesperson should be selected to defend the views held by the four countries at the Peace Conference. Whether the representatives of the seventeen countries are merely companions to the conference will largely depend on this meeting of foreign ministers.</p>
<p>Peace Conference Italian Committee Discusses French-Italian Border Issues</p>
<p>Australian Amendment Rejected</p>
<p>According to United Press: When the Italian Political and Territorial Committee met on the 29th, the Australian representative proposed setting up an investigation committee to assist in adjusting the intelligence on the French-Italian border dispute. After another heated debate with the Soviet representative, it was rejected by a vote of thirteen to six. The United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and France all voted against it, while Australia, Brazil, Belgium, Greece, the Netherlands, and South Africa voted in favor, and New Zealand abstained. During the discussion, Polish representative Winiwicz asked the representatives to abandon trivial disputes and proceed with their work, and reminded the representatives that they had spent a month discussing six and a half pages of the ninety-two page draft treaty. The entire draft treaty must pass through the three sub-committees and the plenary session before being submitted to the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. "We are preparing for peace, not war—atomic war, as some representatives imagine," he said.</p>
<p>Review of Military Clauses</p>
<p>According to Paris Radio on the 29th: The Military Committee today reviewed the military clauses in the Treaty of Peace with Italy. Article 39 did not require any amendments. The Czech representative proposed discussing Article 40, which was also passed after debate by representatives from New Zealand, Czech Republic, France, and the United States. Subsequently, the discussion turned to the clause "Italy shall dismantle and not construct any permanent fortifications in locations that may involve French national territory." The Brazilian representative proposed that new revised wording could be added, adding "but for the sole purpose of national defense, it may be preserved or constructed within 20 kilometers of the border." French representative M. Bardoux said that France abides by the resolutions adopted by the four powers, and the Brazilian amendment is already included in Article 40(c). Italy already has the right to defend its territory under this clause. The Yugoslav representative expressed his agreement with this, and the Brazilian representative withdrew his amendment request. Article 40 was finally passed again. The meeting adjourned at 12:15.</p>
<p>Adoption of Preamble, Part Two, of the Treaty with Bulgaria</p>
<p>According to Agence France-Presse: The Political and Territorial Committee for Bulgaria met on the 29th to discuss the preamble to the Treaty of Peace with Bulgaria. The Australian representative proposed an amendment stipulating the phrase "in accordance with the principles of justice" in the preamble. Yugoslav delegation leader Katarček objected, saying, "The Australian delegation's actions are like missionaries sacrificing themselves for the barbarians of Europe. This is truly incomprehensible. This amendment is enough to make some powerful countries consult on everything." New Zealand delegation leader Jordan expressed opposition and asked the chairman to exercise his authority and re-discuss the amendment proposed by Australia. At this point, the Soviet representative stood up from his seat and declared, "What Jordan said is humiliating to some delegations. The Australian delegation wasted time at the beginning of today's afternoon meeting." The General Assembly finally put the preamble of the treaty and the amendment proposed by Australia to a vote, passing it by a vote of twelve to one, with Yugoslavia voting against. Finally, the second part of this amendment awaits future discussion.</p>
<p>Jewish Terrorists Plot to Assassinate Bevin</p>
<p>British and French Authorities Deny Rumors</p>
<p>[United Press Paris Dispatch, 29th] French police authorities recently denied reports of the discovery of a Jewish terrorist plot to assassinate British Foreign Secretary Bevin. The British delegation also said that the rumors were absurd and ridiculous. French police authorities said that since the opening of the Four Powers Conference, French special guards have been following and protecting the representatives of the four powers.</p>
<p>Balkan Committee Discusses South African Amendment</p>
<p>Soviet Representative Repeatedly Refutes</p>
<p>According to Paris Radio on the 29th: When the Balkan Committee met today, the Ukrainian representative stood up to oppose South Africa's proposed amendment, saying that the first part of South Africa's proposal aimed to link Romania closely to the price trends of the world market, which was unfair. The Yugoslav representative agreed. The British representative strongly defended the South African amendment, and the US representative believed that the principle was that compensation should be borne by the former enemy country and not by the people of the Allied countries. However, the South African representative continued to insist on his position and refuted.</p>
<p>According to Paris Radio on the 29th: Soviet representative Gusev believed that the amendments to the Balkans were unacceptable. He pointed out that prices varied from country to country and could fluctuate for various reasons, so the issue of prices should not be prescribed in advance in the draft treaty. Regarding this point, the Romanian government should be allowed to organize its own economic situation. The amendment proposed by South Africa would involve foreign interference in Romania's internal affairs, causing additional difficulties for Romania's compensation. French representative Stoppani wanted to speak next, but was stopped by the chairman, who proposed to continue the meeting at 10:00 tomorrow. According to tomorrow's agenda, the continued discussion of South Africa's amendment proposals will be included.</p>
<p>Eight Countries' Applications for Membership Spark Heated Debate</p>
<p>Security Council Fails to Reach Agreement</p>
<p>Ukrainian Complaint Temporarily Postponed</p>
<p>[Our Combined Dispatch] The current session of the United Nations Security Council met in New York on the 28th. According to Reuters, at the beginning of the meeting, Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens stood up to speak, advocating for the rejection of Ukraine's complaint against Greece. Kleffens pointed out that Ukraine had failed to provide sufficient evidence, and its complaint was purely vexatious, intended to trouble other countries, and said that the Security Council should seek to protect its dignity. If we allow it to accept all complaints without sufficient reason, it will inevitably harm the interests of the United Nations organization. British representative Jebb also stood up to speak, saying that any country that wants to file a complaint must have sufficient and major evidence. At this point, Soviet representative Gromyko stood up to refute, saying that how could it be known that there was no sufficient reason before the case had been discussed in detail? Rejecting it without consideration by the Security Council would harm its dignity. How could it be known that the Ukrainian representative would not be able to present more detailed evidence when the Security Council discussed the case? The United Kingdom must have been embarrassed by Ukraine's complaint, and if the case had not involved the United Kingdom, Mr. Jebb would have approved it long ago. After such a heated debate, the result was difficult to determine. At this point, Chairman Piquet of the Polish representative suggested that the matter be postponed until the discussion of the member issue was over. This suggestion was immediately accepted by the representatives, and the discussion of the application for membership of the new members began. According to the original nine countries joining this time, but the Siamese government asked to postpone joining due to unresolved territorial disputes with France, so only eight countries remained. American representative Johnson once suggested that the case be combined into a group application, allowing all eight countries to join, regardless of the merits of each country. Brazil, Mexico, China, Egypt and other countries agreed with this proposal, but the Soviet Union and Australia opposed it. Soviet representative Gromyko advocated that each application should be handled individually, and Australian representative Hasluck also believed that from a procedural point of view, it should not be handled as a group, but should always be considered individually. At this point, the US representative withdrew his proposal and decided to discuss the applications of the eight countries individually at the meeting on the 29th.</p>
<p>The meeting continued at 10:30 a.m. on the 29th. According to United Press, the situation at the meeting may again cause the Soviet group and the British-American group to use their veto power against each other. However, the General Assembly may also accept the French proposal, which advocates that in addition to passing Sweden, Iceland, and Afghanistan, the remaining Albania, Ireland, Outer Mongolia, and Portugal should not be discussed for the time being, and should be discussed again after one year. But Gromyko, the representative of Germany, still seems to be trying to get Albania to pass first. The US delegation spokesman said on the morning of the 29th that if the Soviet Union insists, the United States may use its veto power to oppose Albania and Outer Mongolia's membership.</p>
<p>Greek Referendum Nears</p>
<p>Various Parties Predict Royalists Will Win</p>
<p>Time for Showdown Between Left and Right</p>
<p>[United Press Athens Dispatch, 29th] Greece will hold a referendum on September 1 to decide whether to restore the exiled King George II. This vote was organized by the royalist government under pressure from the parliamentary opposition and British forces, and will focus on the issue of the political system. The left-wing parties refused to vote in the parliamentary re-election at the end of March, but have now indicated their participation. 86-year-old statesman Sophoulis, Prime Minister before the People's Party victory in March, has repeatedly criticized that it is not yet time to hold a free and honest vote. Sophoulis is a veteran of the republican faction who has always opposed the right-wing People's Party and is the last surviving veteran of the Liberal Party. Other opponents alongside Sophoulis include three former prime ministers: Papandreou, Kanellopoulos, and the National United Group led by Venizelos Jr. The communist-dominated left has signaled to republican cadres to form an anti-George united front, but the cadres of that faction have resolutely refused to join forces with the left. The right wing is well-organized and has been in power for five months. Important positions are held by loyal monarchists. Even left-wing elements who openly believe George will fail privately admit that George's return is inevitable.</p>
<p>The joint Anglo-American election monitoring team is currently reviewing the amendments to the March election list, which has been severely criticized by the opposition and the abstaining left. George II, known by the people as "the unsmiling man," was exiled after Germany invaded Greece.</p>
<p>[United Press London Dispatch, 28th] Whether Greece will enter the Soviet orbit in the Balkans, or remain the only foothold of the Western Allied countries in the Balkans, a showdown seems to be imminent in a few days. The Greek left-wing Republican Party and the Communist Party, relying on Moscow's moral support, have been fighting the royalists for two years and have finally been defeated. Greek people at home and in London predict that the Greek King will win. The current Tsaldaris cabinet was formed after the parliamentary elections in March of this year and is an open royalist.</p>
<p>Soviet Ambassador Returns to Greece</p>
<p>[Our Report] London Radio 29: Before returning to his country, Soviet Ambassador to Greece Rodionov announced that the embassy's duties would be handled by First Secretary Chenosayev, which shows that the ambassador's return does not mean that Soviet-Greek diplomatic relations have been severed. Before leaving, Luo visited the Greek Foreign Minister and talked for 45 minutes.</p>
<p>British Cabinet To Be Reorganized</p>
<p>[Our Report] London Radio 28: British political circles speculate that Prime Minister Attlee is considering a large-scale reorganization of the cabinet, involving Sir Cripps/or three other cabinet members. The Prime Minister's residence declined to comment on this speculation. What is strange is that three newspapers yesterday carried similar news from political reporters.</p>
<p>Soviet Territorial Ambition Towards Turkey</p>
<p>[Reuters Istanbul Dispatch 28th] A New York Times reporter said that after discovering a "Greater Armenia" map printed in Moscow, annotated in Russian and Armenian, it made people believe that Turkey was facing another problem from the Soviet Union. These maps are given to Armenians in Turkey and the Middle East. According to the map, 10,000 square miles of Turkish territory, accounting for about one-fifth of the country's territory. From the port of Kireç, along the Black Sea coast to the province of Sivas, and south to the border near Iraq, are all within the scope of Greater Armenia. This entire piece of land is about three and a half times the size of Turkey's Kars and Ardahan provinces, which the Soviet Union has long been eyeing.</p>
<p>Britain Refuses Husseini to Attend London Conference</p>
<p>The United States Decides Not to Send Observers</p>
<p>[Our Report] London Radio 29: The British government confirmed today that although the United States has received an invitation from Britain to attend the upcoming Arab-Jewish-British Palestine Conference, it has decided not to send observers. People here believe that the United States' decision is enough to reduce the chances of the conference's success. At the same time, the Colonial Department said that the Mufti of Jerusalem, Husseini, will not be invited to attend the meeting.</p>
<p>British Chief of Staff Reveals Three Conditions for Peace</p>
<p>Speaks to Canadian Veterans</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Ottawa Dispatch 29th] British Chief of General Staff Field Marshal Montgomery's visit to Canada. Today, he gave a speech to Canadian veterans, emphasizing that ensuring world peace must implement the following two major conditions: (1) The British Commonwealth must be reinvigorated and maintain morale. (2) The British Commonwealth must maintain a prepared army, small in number but well-equipped and well-trained, and have excellent post-artillery troops to assist. (3) The British Commonwealth must engage in scientific research and disperse industries.</p>

<p>Iran Asks for Severe Measures</p>
<p>Zhang Province Fortress Attacked by Sasani Tribe</p>
<p>Soviet Side Claims 10,000 Indian Troops Arrived in Basra</p>
<p>[Our Report] London Radio 29: An Iranian spokesman announced today: The Azerbijan fortress of Ardibil, ninety miles west of Greater Tabriz, near the Caspian Sea, is currently under attack by the Sasani tribe. It is said that the Azerbijan Democratic Party "suffered heavy losses" and guerrilla warfare broke out on the outskirts of the city. Chadya Dibil is one of the richest cities in Azerbaijan Province, and 16,000 residents are now in a state of terror.</p>
<p>[Reuters Moscow Dispatch 28th] The Soviet news agency's Tehran telegram said that 10,000 Indian troops had arrived in Basra, and British officers there said they would station themselves in the Kordestan Province of southwestern Iran. The Soviet news agency also said that a large amount of military supplies had been transported from Kuhu and Bahrain in the Persian Gulf to supply the Arabs in Kou Province who were brewing independence.</p>
<p>Consistent U.S. Policy</p>
<p>Uphold Freedom of the Seas</p>
<p>No Right for Others to Interfere with U.S. Fleet Actions</p>
<p>Halsey's Incisive Remarks Aimed at the Soviet Union</p>
<p>West Hemisphere Joint Defense Plan in Progress</p>
<p>[United Press Washington Dispatch 28th] U.S. Navy veteran Halsey, in response to Soviet criticism of the U.S. fleet's tour of the Eastern Mediterranean, specially invited reporters to harshly refute it today.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington Dispatch 28th] Admiral Halsey told reporters today that the United States, in cooperation with Central and South American countries, is establishing a defense system in the Western Hemisphere so that in the event of an incident, we can take care of the people of these countries and cooperate with them. Admiral Harbin, a hero of the Pacific War, has just returned from a goodwill tour of the Southern Hemisphere with Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower. Harbin's remarks have always been known for being pungent. In answering reporters' questions, he said that it is none of anyone else's business where we want to go, and we will go anywhere we like to go. But then he stated that the US fleet does not intend to enter the coasts of other countries, but the high seas are a free zone. Reporters also asked whether the Mediterranean is also a place where US fleets can freely enter and exit without criticism. He replied: "I have stated that any place is the same." Harbin denied that the United States intended to restore the "Big Stick Policy" to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and said: "We need good friends. We have several good friends in South America and hope to maintain these friendships."</p>
<p>Nanjing Massacre</p>
<p>Cruelty Reaches Extremes</p>
<p>Eyewitness Testimony from International Tribunal</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo Dispatch 29th] Prosecutor Michael Lemm of the Tokyo International Military Tribunal testified in court today that Japanese troops committed countless rapes of women during the Nanjing Massacre, and the degree of cruelty was almost unbelievable. 24 hours a day, there was not an hour without women being dragged out by Japanese troops. Japanese troops even poured gasoline on the heads of Chinese people and then set them on fire. In Nanjing, the Japanese troops seemed to be able to do whatever they wanted. Another witness, Fitz, an American who lived in China all his life and now works for the YMCA and the United Relief Association, said: He had witnessed hundreds of Chinese civilians being captured by Japanese troops and used for bayonet practice. All those with their hands empty and Niu Mountain bare were considered by the Japanese troops to be serving in the military, and they were put to death. Their determination to harm all Chinese soldiers was clear. Madam Shui, a supervisor at Ginling Women's College, said that the licentious Japanese troops repeatedly broke into the Ginling Women's College campus and kidnapped the female students they considered most satisfactory. Japanese troops often burned civilian houses at night for fun and to keep warm. Another witness, Mr. Sun, said that Japanese troops had tied up 10,000 civilians and lined them up along the banks of the Yangtze River, then used machine guns to shoot them. All 10,000 people died within an hour. After killing 400 of them, the Japanese troops threw the bodies into the river one by one, which took 30 minutes.</p>
<p>New Translation System Breaks Language Barriers</p>
<p>Foundation of United Nations Set</p>
<p>Any Representative Can Be Heard Simultaneously</p>
<p>[US News Agency Washington Dispatch 28th] Mr. Smith recently wrote an article in the New York Times magazine describing the complex interpretation system of the Nuremberg International Tribunal, which will also be used by the United Nations General Assembly. Smith said: The International Tribunal has many excellent interpreters, who use a system called: Simultaneous interpretation in four languages." This system has contributed greatly to international cooperation. This system has been adopted since the opening of the International Military Tribunal on November 20 last year, and will also be used at the next United Nations New York Conference. The situation of the interpretation system of the International Tribunal is as follows: Auditors, judges, and defendants are all equipped with a pair of headphones, and there is also a converter on their seats, with a dial with five numbers, which can be arbitrarily rotated to listen to the translated language. Judges, defense lawyers, and defendants all speak into the microphone, and the interpreter sits in a small room behind the court, listens, and immediately translates into four languages: English, French, Russian, and German, so that everyone in the court can listen. The interpreters</p>

<p>Hangzhou Sets Tuition Fees: High School 120,000, Elementary School 40,000 [Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 29th] As the autumn school term approaches, schools in the city have begun holding entrance examinations. There are many applicants, but the Municipal Education Bureau has limited the number of admissions. The Ministry of Education, facing financial difficulties, cannot increase the number of public schools. Therefore, it encourages the establishment of private schools to alleviate the shortage of educational opportunities. Currently, the unreasonable phenomenon of military occupation of schools in Hangzhou persists. For example, the famous Anding Middle School, High Technical School, and Shulan Middle School are still forcibly occupied, making it difficult for the schools to reopen. Regarding tuition fees, the current rates are: Kindergarten around 30,000 yuan, Lower Elementary 35,000, Upper Elementary 40,000, Junior High 110,000 (230,000 with boarding), High School 120,000 (240,000 with boarding), University 250,000 (400,000 with boarding). Additionally, the Municipal Government had previously set the tuition for National Schools and private elementary schools to be collected in rice. It has now been approved to convert to cash at a rate of 45,000 yuan per stone of rice.</p>

<p>Zhengshi Middle School Reopens; Founded in 1931, it was Solely Established by Du Yuesheng The private Zhengshi Middle School in this city was founded in 1931 by Du Yuesheng.

The school has built spacious school buildings and dormitories on Anhe Temple Road, with perfect facilities, making it one of the best private schools. With the dramatic increase in the number of students in the city this semester, public and private schools are struggling to accommodate them. Zhengshi Middle School's reopening at this time is undoubtedly good news for the secondary education sector!</p>

<p>1946 National Education Statistics Still Limited to the Nineteen Provinces and Cities in the Rear; Total Number of Schools Reaches 237,000 [Our Newspaper, Nanjing News] Since the implementation of the National Education Plan in 1940, primary education in China has made rapid progress.

<p>A Chorus of Calls to Rescue Out-of-School Children; Severe Shortage of Educational Opportunities Prompts Responses from All Sectors [Our Newspaper Report] The severe shortage of educational opportunities in the city has worsened since the incident a few days ago when elementary school students in Tanggu Road, Hongkou, demanded enrollment and vandalized school facilities. It is reported that the authorities are paying close attention to this and will take emergency measures to rescue out-of-school children. Here are the dynamics of various parties:</p>
<p>Intensifying Donation Drives The Education Loan Committee's work is reaching a saturation point due to the imminent opening of the National Goods Market. To widely promote the market's donation tickets, it has mobilized schools at all levels throughout the city to organize donation teams and launch promotional efforts. Most schools have achieved excellent results, but a few schools have not yet begun donation efforts. The committee today sent letters to these schools, urging them to work together to complete this dual mission of rescuing out-of-school children and promoting national goods. The committee requests that all donation teams settle accounts by the 31st. As for the goods sold for charity obtained by the donation teams, they should be sent to the committee before the 30th to clear records and facilitate organization.</p>
<p>Accelerating the Establishment of Civilian Schools To accelerate the promotion of supplementary education for out-of-school civilians and rescue out-of-school children, the Municipal Education Bureau is not only widely running literacy classes for the public but also actively increasing the number of municipal civilian schools. Fifty schools were established last semester, and twenty new schools have been added recently. Deputy Director Li simultaneously met with the principals and head teachers of each school yesterday (29th) afternoon at 4 PM to hold emergency discussions. Furthermore, due to the large number of school-age children in the North Sichuan Road area, the existing number of National Schools is insufficient to accommodate them. The Municipal Education Bureau has specially allocated part of the school buildings in the Yokohama Bridge Municipal Drama Experimental School to establish a new National School. Gu Zhongyi, Chen Baotai, and Li Jianwu have been appointed as preparatory personnel to prepare for enrollment as soon as possible, with classes starting at the same time as other schools.</p>
<p>Granting Tuition Loans Early According to the city bank, the method for providing tuition loans to impoverished students this semester has been decided to start early next Monday. Elementary schools are eligible to borrow 80,000 yuan, and universities are eligible to borrow 240,000 yuan, with an interest rate of 1.2% per month for a term of six months. However, these loans are limited to the children of impoverished families.</p>
<p>Preferential Treatment for Children of Public Servants To show consideration for the enrollment of children of public servants and teachers, the municipal government has issued the following key points for preferential treatment: (1) Children of public servants and teachers should be given priority admission to municipal schools. (2) Private schools should give priority to admitting children of public servants and teachers for free within 20% of their free places. (3) Applications can be made to the municipal bank for loans. The Municipal Education Bureau has been notified to comply with these measures.</p>
<p>Tennis Singles Finals: Tao Guanqiu Retires Mid-Match Due to Cramps; Carson Wins Men's Championship; Carson Leads 2-1; Fourth Set Incomplete; Luo Feishi Wins Women's Championship [Our Newspaper Report] The men's and women's singles championships of the first Grass Tennis Tournament were decided yesterday. Carson won the Shanghai Men's Singles Championship, and Miss Luo Feishi won the Shanghai Women's Singles Championship. In yesterday's final, Carson was leading 2-1 in sets. When Tao Guanqiu was leading 3-0 in the fourth set, Tao suddenly suffered cramps in his hands and feet. Massage was ineffective, and he was unable to continue, announcing his retirement, which was a great pity. Miss Luo Feishi won two straight sets against Miss Zhu Zhiying. Both the men's and women's finals were quite exciting and fiercely competitive, a rare sight in the past decade. The audience was also very enthusiastic, with nearly 2,000 people, creating an unprecedented scene. The awards were presented by Mr. Huang Shaojiang. The men's and women's singles champions each received a silver cup from Mayor Wu, and the runners-up Tao Guanqiu (men) and Zhu Zhiying (women) each received a silver cup from the Tennis Committee. The final results are as follows:</p>
<p>Miss Luo: Calm and Composed; The women's final began at 4:25 PM, with Zhou Jiaqi as the referee. After a 2-2 tie, Miss Luo won two consecutive games. Although Miss Zhu won one game, Luo won another three consecutive games, taking the first set 6-3. In the second set, Miss Luo became even more stable, hitting the ball calmly. Miss Zhu, under the opponent's aggressive shots, made many mistakes and seemed flustered. Luo won four consecutive games to lead 5-1, and then won another game to win the set 6-2. Miss Luo had ample court experience, and her shots were beautiful and impressive. Miss Zhu seemed to be a bit lacking. Luo Feishi 6-3, 6-2 Zhu Zhiying</p>
<p>Men's Singles: Exciting Performance; The men's senior singles final began, and the atmosphere suddenly became tense. Carson served, and Tao Guanqiu took the lead with 3-1 and 4-1. Carson then began to come to the net and won a game. After Tao Guanqiu lost his service game in the eighth game, Carson took the lead with 5-4 and finally won the first set 7-5. In the second set, Carson continued to aggressively attack with his signature net play. His half-volley shots in front of the net were a sight to behold. Carson won the second set 6-2 with ease, leading 4-1 and 5-2. Tao Guanqiu made many mistakes and was already showing signs of fatigue, unable to resist. In the third set, the server won each game. Carson touched the net three times while coming to the net, giving away the seventh game. Mao Nun took back one set 6-3. After the break, it was hoped that Mao Nun would regain his momentum, but unexpectedly, he suddenly suffered cramps after winning three consecutive games, which was extremely unfortunate. Carson's performance was quite exciting. His groundstrokes were stable, his backhand was reliable, and his serve and net play were all excellent. Mao Nun's achievement was also commendable. It is said that Tao's performance yesterday was inferior to his usual level.</p>

<p>(55) Question: A young child who lives with their sister's husband for life will return to their clan after reaching adulthood. How should this be recorded in the household registration?</p>

<p>(3) Personal Registration Category</p>
<p>(57) Question: Both "waiting-for-husband" daughters-in-law and concubinage are not permitted by law. How should personal registration be handled?</p>

Concubinage registration can be based on the effective date of the Family Law of the Civil Code, and they should be registered separately as concubines and family members.</p>
<p>The Civil Affairs Office recently responded to Tang Dezhen that if a household plaque is lost, a detailed account of the reasons for the loss and the facts should be prepared, and a certificate of loss should be obtained from the local district chief and reported to the local district office for investigation and reissue.</p>

<p>Yarn Prices Adopt a Flexible Approach; Unified Distribution Rumors Dispelled; Centralized Distribution to Be Implemented Today; Future Yarn Market to Shift with Textile Construction [Our Newspaper Report] The procedures for the centralized distribution of yarn by private mills have been prepared and will begin today. Notices have been issued to yarn-using factories, aiming to assist the government in implementing policies to balance supply and demand. It is hoped that everyone will work together to eliminate speculation, eliminate hoarding, suppress price gouging, and stabilize prices. The "Provisional Measures for the Sale of Cotton Yarn by Shanghai Yarn Mills" have been announced, listing eight articles, clearly outlining the procedures for application, approval, payment, and allocation of goods. Applicants can receive notice of approval on the same day, and payment should be made the next day. Mills can distribute the sold yarn successively ten days after receiving payment. The measures also stipulate that applicants who fail to pay as agreed will have their application资格 cancelled. These measures are more favorable to sellers than textile construction. However, since the news of this large-scale distribution, yarn prices have fallen. This is because after the foreign exchange changes, mills have been unwilling to open up more supply.</p>
<p>Yarn Changed to 400 Pounds per Bale; According to market insiders, the yarn produced by mills has traditionally weighed 420 pounds per bale, but now it has been uniformly changed to 400 pounds, with no extra small bundles added. In reality, the amount distributed has been reduced. It is said that this has been agreed to by Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. As for the requirement to pick up goods after ten days of payment, which can then be delayed to ten or more days or even a month, with the power in the hands of the mills, it is believed that other countermeasures are needed to prevent speculation. Yarn and cloth merchants have inquired about the standard for distribution pricing, and the answer is that a flexible approach will be adopted to respond to market changes. Therefore, the market is speculating about future yarn price changes. Yesterday, Textile Construction opened its supply with no change in posted prices.</p>
<p>Bidding Method Fails to Suppress Black Market; However, in addition to distribution, another bidding method is set, where the price is determined by the purchaser, with the highest bidder winning. In reality, this is selling at black market prices. Yesterday, several hundred bolts of chicken fine cloth were bid away by a certain household. This method has been used in the past, but since the foreign exchange changes, a policy of fixed prices and public allocation has been adopted. The sudden return to black market bidding has attracted much attention in the market. Well-informed sources said that private mills originally planned to centrally distribute 20,000 bales of private yarn and 10,000 bales of state-owned yarn, but state-owned mills have now indicated that they do not have such a large amount of yarn in stock. Private mills have also withdrawn their proposal to centrally distribute 20,000 bales. Mills continue to use the word "flexible" as the standard for determining the quantity of yarn to be distributed at any time. It is difficult to predict when the distribution will be completed. According to recent past performance, Textile Construction can produce 20,000 bales of yarn per month, but one-third of its spindles are not in operation. Private mills can produce 40,000 bales of yarn per month, but one-quarter of their spindles are not in operation. Some private mills have a large number of futures orders. It is difficult to predict how much spot goods will be available in the near future. Observers with authority pointed out that a concrete method for state-owned and private mills to cooperate in stabilizing yarn and cloth prices has not yet been established. However, Textile Construction has gained some control over private mills. In the future, the attitude of private mills will shift with the will of Textile Construction.</p>
<p>Various Yarn Mills Establish Sales Methods; The Provisional Measures for the Sale of Cotton Yarn by Shanghai Yarn Mills, established by the Machine Cotton Textile Industry Association of the Sixth District, are as follows: (1) Customers who purchase cotton yarn are temporarily limited to existing customers of each mill. (2) The above customers, who have a genuine need to purchase cotton yarn, should first fill out an application form to the mill they usually deal with, stating the grade, quantity, and purpose of the yarn they intend to purchase. (The application form is attached separately and can be printed by each mill.) The amount of the application must be limited to actual needs. If there is speculation or false reporting, the amount should be reduced or the application资格 cancelled. (3) After receiving the purchase application, each mill must first determine whether the application quantity is accurate based on the customer's previous purchase record. If it is untrue, it should be corrected at any time. The association will decide the quantity and standard price (based on 20s 400-pound double horse standard) and notify each mill by 4 PM on the same day, which will then inform the applicant. Each mill and applicant shall not increase or decrease the decided quantity and price on their own. (4) If there is any remaining amount of cotton yarn to be sold by each mill, the association will allocate it on its behalf. (5) After receiving the notice, the applicant should immediately sign a transaction contract with the mill and pay the full amount in cash the next day.

<p>A Spring and Autumn Discourse on Edgar Allan Poe by Liu Huiwei</p>
<p>Edgar Allan Poe was an astonishing genius in American literary history, but he lived a life of poverty. Early in his life, he was expelled from the University of Virginia for gambling and drinking. Later, he was court-martialed and expelled from West Point because he ignored regulations and sat in his room writing poetry when he should have been practicing with a gun on the parade ground.</p>
<p>Poe was orphaned early and adopted by a wealthy merchant. Eventually, even this merchant drove his adopted son away and left him no money in his will. Poe's marriage is one of the most beautiful stories in literary history. His wife, Virginia Clemm, was his longest-serving cousin. After their marriage, they were very poor. Poe drank strong, raw wine. His sister was insane. Some said Poe was also half-mad. He was twice his wife's age. He was twenty-six, and she was only thirteen. One would expect their marriage to have disastrous results, but in fact, it was a successful romance. Poe loved his child-like wife very much, and because of this eternal love, he wrote several immortal poems in English.</p>
<p>Poe's poems and stories are literary treasures, but he could not earn bread with them. His "The Raven" was written continuously for ten years, and he sold it for only ten U.S. dollars – one year of work worth one U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>In the Grand Concourse area of New York, there is a cottage where Poe and his wife lived. When Poe rented this cottage more than ninety years ago, it was a dilapidated house on the verge of collapse. Now it is surrounded by apartments. But at that time, the cottage was located in the countryside. It was hidden among apple trees. When spring arrived, the air was filled with the fragrance of cherry blossoms and the buzzing of bees. It was a beautiful, dream-like setting.</p>
<p>Poe rented this cottage for three dollars a month. However, Poe could not even pay this small sum. He often did not pay the rent. His wife was suffering from tuberculosis. He could not even afford food for her. Sometimes, they went for days without eating anything. When dandelions bloomed in the yard, they picked some, cooked them, and ate the dandelion flowers. They lived like this day after day.</p>
<p>When the neighbors discovered that Poe and his wife were truly starving, they sent them some food, which was truly pitiful. But he had the genius to write poetry, and she was a passionate soul. Although they were poor, they were very happy.</p>
<p>Virginia died in January not long after. In the months before her death, she slept on a straw mat, without enough clothing to keep her warm. When she was too cold, her mother rubbed her hands, and Poe rubbed her feet. He covered her shivering body with an old military uniform he wore at West Point. At night, he coaxed his cat to sleep at her feet.</p>
<p>After she died, Poe had no money for a funeral. If it were not for the help of neighbors, she might have been sent to a pauper's cemetery.</p>
<p>Virginia died in January. A few months later, spring came, the moon rose in the apple trees, and the stars shone in the western sky. Poe sat and remembered his Virginia. Because of this remembrance, he wrote one of the most beautiful love poems:</p>
<p>The bright moon,</p>
<p>Brings me dreams of my beautiful love;</p>
<p>The starlight is brilliant,</p>
<p>Like the glances of my love's bright eyes.</p>
<p>I sleep beside my love all night,</p>
<p>She is my lover, my life, my bride,</p>
<p>She is in the grave by the sea,</p>
<p>In the grave by the murmuring sea.</p>

<p>"Spring and Autumn Match" is on stage. This was originally a sallow-faced girl who slipped out from behind the curtain sideways. A thunderous applause burst out, shouting at her. Now she is made up with a face full of greasepaint, charcoal, and rouge, plus her original beautiful contours, dressed as a classical beauty. Already a half-mature girl, understanding a little about love and hate, having performed hundreds of different character scenes, she does not appear flustered at all, following the mechanical scene: "Da, da, da, de da da, da," adhering to an absolute standard, moving lightly and enchantingly, walking to the opening of the stage illuminated by countless electric lights.</p>
<p>Flipping her water sleeves gracefully, she carefully recites the introduction. Her voice is indeed what her profession considers a good asset, although it is a bit sharp, but the trailing sound has a lingering charm. "Good—" A particularly long, provocative shout made her heart flutter, and she couldn't help but cast a surprised glance in the direction of the sound. There, a short, fat fellow with a sweaty face was grinning foolishly. Many spectators were also shocked by the good voice of this shout, and everyone looked at him. When this high-spirited fellow noticed the actress's gaze, he shouted strangely without thinking, "Yo—yo!" As a result, the people in the entire small theater were overjoyed, and laughter was everywhere.</p>
<p>This is the reason why people are busily squeezing into the theater. A wonderful scene passed, people cracked melon seeds, drank tea, and chatted; waiting for another wonderful performance with both the main and supporting actors. People are so intoxicated as if they have lost their hearts; releasing their thoughts and souls, temporarily amusing themselves.</p>
<p>The girl calmed her heart, step by step playing her role. At this time, the old hag playing the stepmother aroused her sympathy. This skinny figure with a white nose struggles to speak as a villain, gnashing his teeth. A thick vein on his neck is bulging, and a red sore growing between his neck and shoulder is about to burst open due to the muscle twitching. "Alas, what a fate you have!" the girl thought innocently. However, when this clown picked up the family law and whipped her fiercely, she had a painful and real feeling. "Ouch—" she cried, twitching her shoulders, as if it were real. When she sang "Oh, my mother," strings of tears hung on her greasepaint-covered cheeks!</p>
<p>She was not acting; she was crying to her heart's content, lamenting the sorrow and melancholy of her small heart. There was nothing more enjoyable than this. On the stage, she had the opportunity to indulge in her resentment and sentimentality. Therefore, although she was only in her teens, she had a preference for tragedy; although a forced smile could win more and better applause.</p>
<p>However, she would not be too sad, forgetting that she was acting. The scenes and supporting actors would remind her intentionally or unintentionally; the biggest reason was that when she was playing her life, a pair of fierce and stern eyes were always watching her. Behind the curtain of the stage door, wasn't there always a pair of eagle-like eyes staring at her? It belonged to a fat, pig-like woman, who was her heartless stepmother who always held the family law.</p>
<p>This girl understood a little about love and hate. The elegant and handsome young man in the third scene also gave her a sense of reality. She needed a little love to nourish her. As a fellow actor on the same stage, he was a real gentle and handsome person. She shyly lowered her head, reciting the ancient words of love, trying to swim into the river of love that she had never been to before. This was very moving! People appreciated it, and those who did not shout also shouted, as if they were satisfied.</p>
<p>When the girl was unknowingly floating, a line of lyrics unintentionally went wrong, which was an irreparable mistake. The drummer frowned and accommodated her a little. The string player immediately gave her a "screw"—he was the teacher, after all. Don't look down on this ghostly fellow; he had the ability to teach this set of skills. She was shocked and returned to the reality of acting, singing the scene carefully, word by word, movement by movement.</p>
<p>After removing her makeup and wiping her face with hot water, she had just put on her half-old floral cloth gown when a solid, heavy, and scalding slap hit her still sallow and thin cheek.</p>
<p>"Damn you, you stupid bug! You messed up a line in Nan Bangzi! You're throwing away thirty thousand, you're losing face for your whole life!" the pig-like woman roared, waving her hands.</p>
<p>The girl felt wronged, habitually pouting her mouth. She wanted to say, "I only took ten thousand! You took two hundred and ninety thousand!" "I can sing! I'm not running away, I'm..." However, she couldn't say it. The eagle's eyes were staring at her so fiercely, and she really looked like a shrinking chick. She swallowed her grievances, enduring the too many tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Good!" Another frenzy of applause erupted in the front, directed at another girl who had taken the stage.</p>
<p>This is how they spent many, many years!</p>
<h3 id="e22">On Art Criticism by Yan Wenliang <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Creation and criticism occupy equally important positions in art. Creators can intuitively express a kind of beauty based solely on their personal environment, personality, and era background, while art discussion cases are not limited to one kind of art, but more importantly, possess multiple conditions and multiple knowledge, using different methods and angles to evaluate and accurately judge. In other words, artists only express and crystallize ideas, while art critics are purely spokespersons for artists; or more closely, guiding mentors. Therefore, if it is said that the cultivation of critics is ten thousand times more difficult than that of creators, it is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Everyone acknowledges that the conditions for the prosperity of art naturally require the emergence of outstanding artists for the most part; but another condition is that without the encouragement and supervision of critics, it is often impossible for art to reach a more exquisite and ideal realm. Ruskin's magnificent and precise art criticism held a powerful center in the European art scene, at least to the extent that his remarks influenced several eras without change. The highest criticism never considers the methods and techniques of artistic expression, but is determined solely by the feelings that artistic works give to each individual.</p>
<p>Of course, creators sometimes develop a kind of emotion based on simple personal impressions, and carve it into art. Directly or without any decoration, it is often refined through the training of critics, or even cut out with more emotion. This kind of emotion may be even more inexpressible than that of the creator. This is very possible. Therefore, Da Vinci's "The Last Supper" was almost destroyed at one point, but it has finally been preserved to this day as an indelible value of art criticism.</p>
<p>Art criticism is almost an art in itself. Moreover, it builds a beautiful paradise in the world seen by ordinary eyes more profoundly. The poet Longfellow, after arriving in Rome, had his beautiful poems filled with many timeless satisfactions, songs, and praises for art. Millet's "The Gleaners," that crude man, would not have been noticed if he had not been praised by the poet Théophile Thoré, and that masterpiece would have been overlooked.</p>
<p>Art critics should break all prejudices and overthrow all typical standards. Scales can measure the nature of every object, but when used in art, it somewhat limits it with a certain scale. Once there is a typical concept, it is easy to fall into fixed patterns. Yuan Zicai's discussion of poetry in the past said it well: "Poetry is just each person's temperament, it has nothing to do with the Tang and Song dynasties." Fixed patterns are not necessarily bad, but it is easy to fall into "sticking to old ways," which is natural. Because the path to art is never limited to one way. Wang Chong once said in his autobiography: "The children of a hundred families do not have the same parents, they are born in different ways and do not necessarily look alike. Each has its own gifts and is good in its own way." Art has this kind of phenomenon. They are born in different ways and do not necessarily look alike, as long as each has its own gifts. Therefore, art critics should abandon their own scales, which may also be very important.</p>
<p>Of course, the conditions for possessing an art critic are not limited to one way. Other things, such as keen senses and attentive cultivation, are also many important conditions. Even more so, a kind heart and noble mind are also necessary conditions for a true art critic. No matter what kind of art is being criticized, even if it does not agree with the critic's personal will, he should sincerely point out his faults, abandon the concept of personal hatred, and make the receiver feel as cordial and pleasant as meeting an old friend. With such a result, all art can enter the correct path and the prosperity of art can be expected.</p>

<p>Work, work, new vitality injected into the blood vessels, this simple stroke is so exciting, tempting, and influencing me.</p>
<p>Without work, life is just dregs. Without work, life is just like a zither without a score, vulgar, disorganized, noisy, and boring. If work stops, doesn't the meaning of the entire life suddenly stop?</p>
<p>Work will drag me down, but the hollow eye sockets are filled with pleasant brilliance. Fatigue will come in waves, but endless confidence is supporting me. Work encompasses happiness, it illuminates the path of life.</p>
<p>There is no greater pain in the world than having no work. In short, it's boring, boring, boring...</p>
<p>Isn't everyone aspiring and hopeful for themselves? Work is the medium. Without work, everything is just an illusion, everything is empty. Work fairly praises everyone, it engraves everyone's hard work and laziness.</p>
<p>Work encourages everyone's vitality, work guarantees that the world will not perish. Humanity is advancing, the world is progressing, because there is work, work creates warmth, and isn't the gloomy air all cleared away?</p>
<p>Work, isn't everyone praising it? Knowing that all work will bring fatigue and hard work, but who shrinks back?</p>

<p>In the tense situation at the time, I couldn't care whether it was a fact or an illusion, I just thought about the second step.</p>
<p>"Let's go, old man?" It was still a child's voice.</p>
<p>"No, we have to move these two guys to the car and send them to the small river in front." This was the latter part of my plan. The first part, of course, was still thinking of relying on my school pistol, using the accurate means I had practiced, to shoot the two of them. But judging from the facts that have already happened, my plan may be a failure; because these two teammates have already preempted the opportunity. At most, we and the other party can only achieve an equal opportunity. In other words, if it weren't for Little Tiger's actions being so swift and agile, pushing me aside, maybe I could have hit them both, and Little Tiger and I might have each eaten a bullet from them.</p>
<p>After the latter part of my plan was implemented, I drove the car back; after passing the place where the fierce fight had just taken place, I slowed down the speed by less than half a mile. Little Tiger and I got out of the car; and the car continued to move forward freely; after running not far, it turned into the field on its own.</p>
<p>At this time, it was about the eighth or ninth day of the sixth lunar month. There should have been a moon, but the cloud cover was quite thick, and I still couldn't see anything clearly, I could only distinguish the path in front of my feet. In order to avoid the patrols, I had to abandon the road and pick a secluded field, walking towards the sparsely lit places. The tense nerves gradually returned to normal.</p>
<p>After walking for half an hour, thinking that I had avoided the firing line and other dangers, I picked the foot of a small grave and sat down.</p>
<p>"Did you take everything?" I thought of my pistol and Little Tiger's pocket.</p>
<p>"Our things?...They're all here." As if by magic, Little Tiger pulled out my pistol from his belt and pulled out that precious cloth pocket from behind, still full, "And I got two other things." Saying that, he pulled out the flashlight he had just used, and a small knife—a rather exquisite Japanese small purse.</p>
<p>"This gun?" I took the pistol, wanting to ask him when he had picked it up.</p>
<p>"When we moved those two guys to the top of the car, I picked it up next to the front wheel, pressed it on my waist, and forgot!"</p>
<p>"Didn't we turn off the lights earlier?" I suspected how he could see clearly—the gun was black, and the dirt on the ground was also black.</p>
<p>"I can see even if it's darker, my grandfather said I have cat's eyes—innate."</p>
<p>"Look what time it is now," I wanted to test his special eyes, and turned my wrist to show him my watch.</p>
<p>"Eight forty...minutes."</p>
<p>I took his trophy flashlight and shone it on it, and it was indeed exactly right. I thought of the child's big eyes with more black than white, which seemed to be a special gift. But when I was studying life, I don't remember having this article. Maybe this is an exceptional example, not recorded in the war.</p>
<p>"So, walking at night is the same as walking during the day?" Surprise and curiosity were mixed together.</p>

<p>We cannot take the destruction of the Sixteenth National School on Tanggu Road by students lightly. The seriousness contained in this incident is apparent.</p>
<p>The reason why the students destroyed the school is as follows—</p>
<p>Private school tuition is high. The school stipulates that no tuition is charged, so the number of new students who applied for the exam reached more than 2,200. The school authorities, in addition to continuing the 600 old students, had a balance of only more than 300 students. Yesterday, 300 new students were admitted, but there were still 1,900 who were not on the list. So they jointly asked Principal Qian to "We all want to study medicine, please help us, Principal;" However, due to classroom capacity and funding issues, the request could not be accepted, and a destruction scene occurred.</p>
<p>Students' actions may be reckless, but the motive cannot be denied as pure. If the educational authorities do not quickly seek effective solutions to this problem, I am afraid that such incidents will not only occur at the Sixteenth National School.</p>
<p>We have repeatedly called for the tuition fees of private schools to be too expensive, and we have also requested the authorities to pay attention to the pain of students wandering around without being able to enter school; after all, only a small number of wealthy families' children can study in private schools, and letting education become the exclusive right of the nobility is by no means something that the authorities can remain silent on. If the authorities cannot popularize education to the public, this is not only a dereliction of duty, but also a sin, creating all the sins of society.</p>
<p>The lack of educational funding is the fundamental reason, and in the paper drunk gold fan big Shanghai, to let students have no school to read, as Shanghai people should feel ashamed; although the respect for teachers movement has ended, the loan student fund is still going on, wealthy friends, in addition to your own children, can you think about other people's children and take out some money—</p>
<p>We want to expand the loan student fund movement, don't think that your own children can have schools to enter. If the majority of out-of-school youths become angry and resentful and wish to be equal with regard to everything, if everyone has no school to enter, is it a blessing to society?</p>
<p>In addition to this, we also contribute a little opinion. Can all schools in Shanghai, whether public or private, add night schools? (With the same curriculum and qualifications as day schools) In this way, can the classroom capacity problem be solved?</p>
<p>In short, we must not ignore this matter, and we must not use bureaucratic means to perfunctorily deal with it.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Occasional Thoughts in Early Autumn by Gao Wuhong <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Summer lazily left with its tail dragging, followed by autumn. "The west wind rises, the sky is blue, the chrysanthemums cover the ground, the wild geese fly south." Looking at the scenery in front of me, I really feel a mix of emotions. Although the weather is still hot, the poor are already worrying about winter clothes; "The whole family is in the west wind, and the food and clothing for September have not yet been cut!"</p>
<p>The Mid-Autumn Festival is coming soon, and all kinds of mooncakes stand in the windows of food companies, casting proud glances at people, seemingly saying: "Who has the strength to move me back!" Miss Mooncake, don't be carried away, the person who moves you back is going to eat you, but the people who linger in front of the window all day long, looking at you with longing eyes, are carefully appreciating your beauty and thinking of you day and night.</p>
<p>"China is starving, Shanghai is dancing,"</p>
<p>But just dancing is simply a "scene of prosperity." Is this "prosperity" fanned up by a small number of people? Can you say no? To raise money for refugees, "Miss" elections are held, and after "Queen," this trick has been adopted by foreigners. When Warner Company celebrates its 20th anniversary, it plans to hold a "Standard Beauty Contest" in Shanghai and invite all young women in the city who are twenty years old to watch the event for free. The period for electing "Standard Beauty" is predicted by the author to be around Double Ten Day this year; because Warner Company is celebrating its 20th anniversary, and the selected young woman is twenty years old, three Double Tens should be put together.</p>
<p>In this way, the already selected "Shanghai Miss" and "Queen" become questionable.</p>
<p>After the "Standard Beauty" is elected, what other tricks will be played in Shanghai in 1940?</p>
<p>Shanghai's urban plan has a 25-year target and a 50-year preparation. It's truly great!</p>
<p>Others have five-year plans and ten-year plans, but we only have one plan to build a great Shanghai, which is fifty years, enough to make others' five-year plans and ten-year plans pale in comparison.</p>
<p>Why not just set it for one hundred years? "A century of great plans," isn't that better? Many of China's "first-class scholars" are not always saying: "My plan will definitely be realized in a hundred years." "My works will definitely be popular all over the world in a hundred years."</p>
<p>People's hearts are sad, etiquette is lost, and the loyalty between people is not as good as a dog, so dogs are used to revitalize people's hearts. If you don't believe it, look at the advertisement for "Loyal Dog Saves Master." Doesn't it say: "Meritorious service to the world, encourages people's hearts. It will move you to tears!"</p>
<p>Drama advertisements have also become like movies. Colorful films are popular, so the advertisement for "Peacock Gallbladder" comes up with a "colorful, magnificent, luxurious, and incomparably sad, tragic historical tragedy." Why not say seven colors or ten colors?</p>

<p>The health and well-being of the human body depend greatly on the soundness of the lungs. In order not to let Shanghai's lungs rot, we sincerely hope that the municipal authorities will seriously consider the application to resume horse racing, and hope that the conversion to a park can be implemented as soon as possible!</p>

<p>It was reported that at 3:40 pm on August 26, a sick discharged soldier was found by an inspector from the Huangpu Sub-bureau, who used a police car to transport him to Renji Hospital. At that time, the hospital refused to accept him because there were no empty beds in the ward. He was then sent to Guangci Hospital, which was also refused for the same reason. He was then sent to the Red Cross Hospital, but was still refused because the beds were full. Finally, he was sent to Hongen Hospital, but was also refused on the pretext that the beds were full. After many transfers and throws, he traveled east and west. By 8 pm, this seriously ill soldier with ragged clothes had traveled all over the major hospitals in Shanghai, but had no chance to receive medical treatment. After a long journey, he died in the police car.</p>
<p>Hospitals refuse to accept seriously ill patients on the grounds that there are no empty beds. This is a strong contrast to those who receive patients under the guise of recuperation, but are actually turning hospital wards into hotels. Moreover, even if a hospital accepts any patient who needs emergency treatment, the handling fee must be paid in advance before surgery can begin. From these two things, it can be seen that the magic power of "money" is truly great.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think that hospitals in the future do not need to use the Red Cross as a symbol, but may as well use "Confucius's brother" as a trademark.</p>

<p>I am studying chemistry. Because I have joined the embrace of the motherland in a remote small mountain town, I have silently let my university process go by unnoticed. In those ordinary four years, I never had a romance. I believe: this is all because of the unstable life, which does not arouse the interest in finding love. Recently, my colleagues always like to joke about me as a "bachelor," so I feel the need to use "finding a love object" to deal with them; today I have drafted several qualifications that my future wife should have, and write them out frankly:</p>
<p>My ideals for my future wife are not demanding at all; the following points will make you understand: will you be my ideal partner. You—</p>
<p>(1) Have received more than ten years of education, and hold a continuously upward view of life.</p>
<p>(2) Able to handle big and small matters calmly.</p>
<p>(3) Believe that the hope for life should gradually step onto the stage of "truth, goodness, and beauty," and have absolutely no desire for vanity.</p>
<p>(4) The appearance does not have to be moving, just not annoying to look at. (Objectively)</p>
<p>(5) Do not indulge in alcohol, mahjong, or poker. When there is time to kill, I am willing to spend it all on books, newspapers, sports, and proper entertainment.</p>
<p>(6) Have a habit of loving cleanliness; but do not often apply cosmetics, paint nail polish and lipstick, or perm your hair into an airplane or other styles.</p>
<p>(7) Do not wear flashy and dazzling clothes; believe that a blue cloth cheongsam and a pair of medium-heeled leather shoes are the most comfortable for usual dress.</p>
<p>(8) Able to manage the home, with a little talent for designing or arranging small rooms.</p>
<p>(9) Have a love for travel.</p>
<p>If you are confident that the above points are not in conflict with you, and you are also interested in interacting with me, then please think about what methods you will use to make me know you; you must use your ingenuity!</p>

<p>Translated by Yu Qiang</p>
<p>Joseph Bell, and many such reasoning is recorded in other articles. Conan Doyle's Edinburgh University classmate Dr. Jones recalled:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, what ails this man?" Bell suddenly asked the trembling students standing beside him. "You, see, look at him. No, you must not touch him. Use your eyes, - use your ears, use your brain, use your impulse feeling, use your reasoning ability!"</p>
<p>The stuttering student tried his best to say: "Hip joint disease, sir?"</p>
<p>"There is nothing wrong with the hip joint!" Bell replied with disgust. "This man's limp is not due to his hip, but only due to his feet, or rather due to his pair of feet. Have you carefully noticed the cut slits on those shoes, the slits are located where the shoes exert the greatest pressure on the feet. He has corns, gentlemen, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with the hip joint. But he is not here to ask us to treat corns, gentlemen, we are not chiropodists. His troubles are more serious than this. This is a symptom of invasive alcoholic toxicity, gentlemen. The red nose, swollen face, bloodshot eyes, trembling hands, convulsive facial muscles, plus the rapid, palpitating, and distinct arteries, all tell us so. But these inferences, gentlemen, must be proven with absolute and concrete evidence. In this case, my diagnosis is proven by the whiskey bottle protruding from the patient's right hand pocket."</p>
<p>To another patient, he once said: Gentlemen, here we have a person who is either cutting corks or chiseling stones. If you use your eyes a little, you will be able to see a slightly hard callus on one side of his index finger, and a thicker callus on the outside of the thumb; "a sure sign that he is doing the former, not the latter."</p>
<p>On another occasion, he expressed his observation: "A fisherman—you notice that although it is late summer and the weather is very hot, this patient is wearing Wellington boots. When he sits on the chair, the boots can be seen clearly. Except for sailors, no one wears Wellington boots in this season. His face is tanned, indicating that he is a coastal sailor, not a deep-sea sailor on the outer ocean. His tan is only caused by one climate - it is still local skin color. A knife sheath is exposed under his upper garment, which is the kind used by fishermen in this area. He is also hiding a wad of tobacco in a deeper corner of his mouth, doing it very skillfully. Gentlemen, the conclusion of these inferences is that he is a fisherman. To further prove the correctness of my diagnosis, as soon as a fishy smell reported his arrival very clearly and stimulated, I noticed many fish scales attached to his clothing and hands."</p>

<h3 id="e35">Additional Budget for General Expenditures Passed by the Legislative Yuan Yesterday; Lou Tongseng Reports on Conclusions of Economic Policy Review <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 29th] The Legislative Yuan held its 306th regular meeting at 9:00 AM on the 29th. Thirty-one committee members were present, with President Sun presiding. First, Lou Tongseng reported on the general situation of the Yuan's nine-member committee (see below). Subsequently, proposals were discussed and the following cases were passed: (1) Draft Organizational Law of the Resources Committee; (2) Amendment to Article 6 of the Order of Merit Regulations; (3) Draft Organizational Regulations for the Southeast Plague Prevention Office; (4) Amendment to the accounting section of the Judicial Yuan Organizational Law; (5) Amended and passed the Draft Special Profit Tax Law for Speculative Activities; (6) Sino-Brazilian Cultural Agreement; (7) Passed the additional budget book for the national general expenditures of the 34th year of the Republic for Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Shandong, Sichuan, Xikang, Gansu, Chahar, Henan provinces, and Chongqing, Nanjing, Beiping, Shanghai and other eighteen provinces and cities.</p>
<p>Financial and Economic Policy</p>
<p>Lou Tongseng's report briefly stated: The working method of the committee was divided into three types: meetings and discussions, group research, and separate interviews, lasting two months. Ten meetings were held, six of which included inviting responsible persons from the Ministries of Finance, Economy, Food, and Transportation, the Executive Headquarters, the Joint Treasury Board, and the Central Bank to attend and provide explanations. The committee also reviewed the following future work trends: (1) The government lacks a unified policy on financial, economic, and monetary issues. The system is scattered, and each competent authority acts independently, lacking close connection. (2) Authority does not reside within the institutions. Those who have the power to implement do not necessarily have to take responsibility. (3) The government's approach to handling financial and monetary matters is too drastic. For example, the recent adjustment of foreign exchange rates was too large in proportion. Such measures may damage government credibility or stimulate market fluctuations, which is really lacking in consideration. (4) Attention should be paid to research on policy institutions and personnel. The conclusions are: (1) Our view is that the economy comes first, while the administrative authorities' view is that finance comes first. (2) Our focus is on people's livelihoods and the national economy first, while the administrative authorities' focus is on seeking national unification and urgently solving two or three matters. Therefore, we are taking into consideration the entire financial, economic, political, and military situation, so that political and economic normalization does not hinder finance and military affairs.</p>
<p>Two Investigations</p>
<p>Subsequently, Tian Liqingying reported on (A) the investigation into the amount of coarse grain requisitioned by the Food Department this year and the actual situation of military grain quotas. It was found that the Food Department does not have a complete food policy, resulting in a failure to fully consider the interests of both consumers and producers, which is detrimental to the national economy and people's livelihoods. The Food Department should quickly find ways to transport the abundant grain from the rear to the needy areas, stabilize market prices in the sales areas, and reduce the burden on the people. (B) Regarding the Ministry of Economic Affairs' handling of enemy and puppet assets, the opinions in the investigation report are as follows: (1) Regarding the handling of factories and mines taken over in the Hebei-Rehe-Chahar area, those still under the custody and management of the Office account for more than 70% of all factories and mines, and each factory and mine has not attached a statement of "having materials." (2) Of the 334 units of factories that have been taken over, more than 200 have not started production. (3) The operating conditions of the factories and mines that have resumed production are very good, but they only claim to be "self-sufficient and have a surplus," which is incomprehensible. (2) In the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui area, (1) there is no detailed report on the situation in the Anhui area. (2) The types and numbers of factories, mines, companies, and affiliated units taken over in Shanghai have not been listed in detail. (3) There are 176 factories that have resumed production, and they are all textile factories. Whether the rest are in a state of shutdown. (4) The numbers of factory materials returned are not detailed. (5) The method of handling sealed materials is also unknown whether the sale price is known, or whether it has been transferred to the national treasury. (3) In the Hunan-Hubei area, (1) according to the report of the special commissioner, the quantity of materials does not match the original inventory. (2) There are no detailed figures for the factory and mine units taken over in the Hunan area. (4) In the Guangdong-Guangxi-Fujian area, the value of materials and warehouse materials were not mentioned. Regarding the Taiwan area, according to the report from the area, the assets should be NT$8.6 billion, but currently there are only NT$3.3 billion.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Rate</p>
<p>Regarding the Central Bank's recent increase in the foreign exchange rate, this committee believes that the current economic crisis has many long-standing causes. After long-term mutual stimulation, it has accumulated and formed a way to save the situation. There are thousands of clues, but the only main method is to first determine a long-term economic policy. From this, a complete plan should be formulated, and then a set of implementation methods should be determined according to the plan, step by step, and advanced in parallel. The government and the society should work together to promote it, so as to avoid economic catastrophes. A temporary relief method cannot be effective. It must be known that finance is a link in the entire economic life. Financial measures and monetary activities must be in line with the entire economic construction policy to achieve the expected results. If monetary activities do not match financial measures or are not related to economic policy, then this type of monetary activity will only benefit a few people and cannot alleviate the misfortune of most industrial and commercial enterprises, let alone solve the economic crisis of the entire society. In recent years, the administrative authorities have seemed to only pay attention to monetary activities, invisibly leading the entire country to concentrate assets on the buying and selling of gold and US dollars, while ignoring the economic construction that is related to the national economy and people's livelihoods, resulting in the social and economic situation deteriorating. Foreign exchange control is extremely important. The pricing control should be adjusted at any time according to the market supply and demand, which is beneficial to industry and commerce. If a fixed exchange rate remains unchanged for several months, and then suddenly changes, the changed exchange rate will be vastly different, only causing merchants with large amounts of foreign exchange and hoarding large amounts of export goods to make huge profits. As for genuine producers, they benefit very little. The sudden increase in the foreign exchange rate by more than 60% is indeed beneficial to industry and commerce, but the value of the legal currency against foreign currency has also been devalued by more than 60%, stimulating price increases and greatly affecting people's livelihoods. The members of this committee believe that the consideration before this increase in the foreign exchange rate was not thorough enough, and hope that efforts will be made to promote comprehensive remedial measures as soon as possible to prevent the social and economic situation from becoming increasingly dangerous.</p>

<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch of the 29th] A large batch of materials from the Executive Headquarters recently arrived in Hangzhou from Shanghai on the 27th, mostly canned foods such as milk. However, some of these cans were cracked, and maggots were moving inside. The Zhejiang-Fujian Branch immediately cooperated with personnel from the UNRRA office to inspect and select the better cans. The headquarters was asked to instruct on the disposal of the spoiled canned goods. In addition, road openers that have been in Hangzhou for a month have arrived from the Relief Administration, some weighing 15 tons. Hangzhou's cranes can only lift one ton, so they cannot be lifted and used. Efforts are now being made to have people drive the machines out.</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Detroit, 28th] The Wall Street Journal recently reported: Fifty "agricultural missionaries," all members of the tractor driving team under the leadership of UNRRA and members of the Brethren Church, were trained for two weeks in the fields near here, learning how to assemble and disassemble tractors and implements, and studying Chinese culture, geography, and language in the evenings. They will arrive in China in September of this year in time to plant winter wheat and will work in the Yellow River area.</p>
