<h3>赤峯共軍準備撤退　熱全省大半收復　冀東前進國軍進駐樂亭</h3>
<p>〔本報北平四日電〕赤峯被國軍收復說，今仍未能證實，但守赤峯共軍，大事破壞機塲及搬　物資，則一如退出承德之跡象，該地居熱河中心，佔有則可控制熱北，且爲熱北蒙人牲畜毛皮之交易中心，嚴冬之交易中心。現熱省經國軍收復縣有阜新，朝陽，凌源，建平，平泉，凌南，寗城，赤峯，（雖未證實但政府已派縣長前往）承德，灤平等十縣，爲全省廿一縣之半，但其主要部份，已全入政府掌握，俟平承路打開，熱河之軍事政治意義，殊未可輕視。另訊，隆化方面國軍已到隆化西北廿公里處，另一部向豐寗推進中。鄭洞國對記者暗示，熱境共軍少作抵抗，即因其集中兵力於攻取大同，故收復圍塲赤峯，可無大阻碍，古北口至承德距離雖近，但山岳重重，共軍一部尙集中山中，國軍推進或稍需時日。</p>

<p>〔本報瀋陽四日電〕據息，鄭洞國今由平抵山海關，刻祖任該方面國軍指揮工作。</p>
<p>〔本報天津四日電〕鄭洞國將軍二日自瀋飛平，晤華北軍事當局，四日午十二時半，乘車過津出關。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽四日電〕記者頃以熱河戰事叩詢杜聿明長官，杜表示爲了不再死等挨打，故有此次之進軍，我方指揮爲鄭副長官洞國，經兩天半之努力，正式收復承德，現生力軍多已開到，承德日趨安謐，古北口方面國軍，即可會師，錦州至承德之錦承路，現通車至平泉，由此以西沿路遭受共軍破壞甚重現正搶修中。據杜估計，熱河共軍尙有三萬之兵力，遠南共軍前曾擬策應熱河戰事，發動攻勢，已被擊退。</p>
<p>〔中央社　　三日電〕自十三軍軍長石覺　將就任承德警備司令後市內治安巳漸恢復，惟共軍退却前破壞甚多，允以承市電源轉電設備、　遭炸毁，以致電燈不明，致成黑暗世界，錦古路自搶修後進展驪速，凌源至平泉即，可通軍　西至承德間因破壞極烈，鋼軌忱木爾缺，修復困難。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平四日電〕軍調處今日報吿，派駐承德執行小組，下落不明，該組最後一决無錢電報吿，係於八月廿七日收到。另據政府方面消息，熱河方面國軍乘勝疾進，共軍正向承德西北二百五十哩之　倫退却，但此訊尙未證實。</p>

<p>〔本報北平四日電〕調查安平事件之廿五小組，四日晨開會，政府方面提出增加二證人（一爲俘虜之共軍，一爲出事前被共軍截去汽車之商人），共方反對，因此無結果散會，五日晨續開·</p>
<p>〔中央社北平三日電〕軍調部廿五小組拜訪三方高級指揮官程序，已順利完成。</p>
<h3>張家口充滿戰意　聶榮臻承認國軍入承德　對大同則謂仍在包圍中</h3>
<p>〔本報北平三日電〕長城綫烽烟相接中，指揮這一綫共軍的聶榮臻（冀晋察邊區司令），今天在張家口接見四位隨廿五小組的中外記者，他說：爲了軍事上的必要，共軍　經作戰，於廿六日退出承德，日前戰事正向冀東和遼西擴大。談到長城另一端的大同，他否認共軍曾一度攻進大同，說還在包圍中。合衆社記者派克問，共軍是否一定要攻下大同，聶答：和平了怎麼都好說。接着他便攻擊閻錫山利用日俘作戰和胡宗南部進入晋南·記者追問多少時候可以拿下大同，聶答，那裏不是歸我指揮，現在由賀龍參謀長張宗遜負責。在問答裏他否認傅作義部國軍已到三岔口消息，說平綏西段共軍前錢在卓資山以東，那裏還很平靜。外記者問，如國軍進攻張家口，共軍是步承德之後，自動撤退呢，還是堅決抵抗，聶答，對方決心進攻，我們便決心抵抗。聯合社記者馬特來森臨別，深嫌來去忽忽，表示願短期再來，聶詩意的說「這是個秋天阿，希望這是個春天」，目前的張家口，充滿戰爭氣味，每條街的壁報牌上，幾乎都號召着動員自衛。一位政府方面的人士吿訴我，街上每天抓壯丁很凶，軍需工廠工作時間，延長到十四小時，禮拜天也不休息，邊區貿易公司趕製三千匣餅乾，慰勞「前方」戰士，中共幹部的太太們，都已向鄕村疏散，每一座高樓大厦，都再貼上許多紙條，近郊田野到處挖有防空壕，今天小組在由機塲進入張家口市途中，曾有飛機兩架凌空偵察，打好幾個圈子，才向北飛去。三方代表都嚇得跳下汽車，跑到秋莊稼樑裏防了一次空。</p>

<p>晋熱戰事問：大同情况如何？國防部李處長代答：周恩來先生曾保證不攻大同，但自六月廿一日開始進攻大同外團各據點，前後共陷九縣，並於八月三日直接進攻大同，截至本日止，大同仍在政府軍手中。問：國軍是否準備進攻張家口？答：大同·張家口·承德·因地形上之關係，歷來作戰即視爲一個戰塲，若共軍不停止進攻大同，則情勢至有擴展至張家口可能。問：在歷史上延安是吾亦與大同爲同一戰場？答：吾。問：政府軍隊進攻赤峯，情况如何？答：佔領赤峯事未得報吿，對於承德之進佔，願作簡明報吿：緣政府十三軍在平泉以北寗城駐有一部，當共軍圍攻寗城，由該軍派隊解圍後，前方將領接獲承德民衆代表報吿，承德爲一空城，所有蕭克賀龍軍隊均往攻大同，該地人民不堪共軍騷擾，歡迎國軍進駐，故兵不血刃即進入承德，爲確保承德計，不得不佔領其北之隆化及東南之灤平。</p>
<p>蘇北情況間：蘇北情况如何？國防部李處長代答：七月初，周恩來先生忽向政府抗議國軍進攻蘇北，共軍並僞造湯恩伯將軍之作戰命令，藉爲口實，而發動大規模進攻，參加攻擊之部隊，計有粟裕。譚震林兩部，共約十六個團兵力，且曾僞稱王鐵漢將軍被俘，終遭政府軍隊之反擊而北竄，國軍旋收復如皋·海安·李堡後，爲遵守停戰協定，未再追擊，而共軍復又增援反攻，連陷丁堰，林梓，進而圍攻海安，目前政府曾爲避免事態擴大而採防禦措施，共軍若仍繼續進攻，超過政府軍忍耐之限度，則事態必有擴大可能。</p>
<p>國軍裝備問：中國有多少個美械裝備師？答：抗日戰爭之反攻前，預定爲三十九個師，但勝利後，美租借法案即行停止，美械亦停止　華，故目前已裝備完善者，僅原在印度之六個師，其餘三十三個師，裝備之程度不及百分之七十。</p>

<h3>周恩來語外記者　大局前途極悲觀　據稱中共與蘇並無起碼接關係</h3>
<p>〔聯合社本埠三日訊〕中共代表周恩來三日下午自滬返京，行前曾接見聯合社記者，發表談話，謂中國大局有引起完全決裂及擴大爲全面內戰之危險，並謂共軍擇有利之地，實行反攻事屬當然。內戰主要原因之一，爲曾獲美國政府支持，美國如停止此項援助，並將軍隊自中國撤退，則和平「立可實現」。周氏並答記者問，謂蘇聯政府從未援助共黨黨，中國共產黨爲一政黨，與蘇聯並無直接關係。周氏謂，本人不信中國內戰，可以自動引起第三次世界大戰。周氏並稱：馬歇爾特使與司徒大使之聯合聲明雖巳承認其任務失敗，但美國仍進行談判將其剩餘物資售與中國，此項剩餘物資計値美金八億五千五百萬元，爲中國歷史上之最大數目，如此公然對中國雙方作戰中之一方加以援助，自將馬使及司徒大使之和平努力歸於無效，內戰亦因而完全無法控制。</p>
<p>又謂：共軍作戰並無意鼓動革命推翻政府。</p>

<h3>于斌抵滬暢談北行觀感　東北工業待興復　基礎雄厚不難恢復舊觀</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕東北救濟會代表于斌，王曉籟兩氏，八月六日由首都飛赴北平，轉往東北瀋陽錦州，四平街，長春等地，慰問東北難胞，業已公畢，八月二十三日返平，于斌總主教於卅日由平轉赴濟南，勾留三日，曾與第二綏靖區司令官王耀武將軍晤談，三日晚八時由濟飛返滬。記者昨趨天主教福利會訪謁于氏，茲誌其談話如下：</p>
<p>山東情況　濟南疊次受共軍包圍，外界人士頗以爲城內軍民焦急萬分，此决本人抵濟，所見並不如是，現城內軍民充滿一團朝氣，城防鞏固，治安極爲良好，且山東全省情况亦佳。</p>
<p>關外進步　關外情形，一般言之，人心均極鎭定，自蔣主席親臨東北後，進步很多，工業方面，重工業根據地，經過蘇聯搬走，共黨破壞後，損失雖甚重大，但因以往規模宏偉，剩下之設備，仍比關內各省爲佳，基礎極爲良好，假如能投入大量資本，補充一部分設備，則恢復舊有規模，自極易易。最近日僑技術人員大部遣歸，關外同胞希望關內允其是上海工業界人士，踴躍出關共同致力工業復員工作。彼等曾對王曉籟氏詳作說明，東北工廠，瀋陽一區，即有四千五百餘所，現由東北生產管理局統一管理，吳鐵城先生曾說「不到東北，不知東北之大」，本人可以說：「不到東北，不知中國工業潛力之大」。東北農產今年收成甚豐，肥田達十二成，瘠田亦達六成左右，除遼北省一部分地區，因共黨擾亂春耕未能下種外，其餘各地普遍豐收，松花江上大豆高粱一望無際，眞有全國倉庫之稱。</p>
<p>接收工作　至於接收工作，大體言之，尙未聞及貪汚舞弊情事，惟大部分工廠接收後，多未能迅速開工。在若干接收事業中，最引人注意者爲永吉之「小　滿發電廠」，偽滿時期經營該廠能發電五十六萬瓩，最高可容量爲百萬瓩，該廠電力能供給「北滿」及「南滿」各地民用及工業需要，抗戰勝利後，內部設備先經蘇聯搬運，繼經共黨破壞，剩留機器祇能發出十三萬瓩之電量，其輸電區域，現仍受共黨控制，目前祗能發出三萬瓩之電力，其餘十萬瓩停貯不用，殊爲可惜。</p>
<p>東北缺棉　談及民生疾苦，總主教親明東北人民生活，食住尙無問題惟棉花缺乏，冬裝頗成問題，轉瞬十月，東北雪季快臨，數千萬同胞及三十萬將士棉皮服裝均甚缺少，如東北救濟分署不能及早籌劃救濟，則凍死者恐怕將有數萬人之多。</p>
<p>民氣旺盛　最後于氏稱：上决本人赴東北，深感東北人民「安全感」，「穩定感」都不够，此番去東北，民氣之旺盛，實充滿新氣象，希望國人及友邦人士，對東北亦能有一新認識。長春現已成爲一國內有數之現代化都市，建築物之輝煌，令人忘其本來面目，據聞：敵僞時期曾在該市籌建「日本皇宮」，大有自東京移都長春之勢，敵人遺留之大陸科學院，規模極爲宏大。又東北各地自衛武力，均已普遍建立，穩紮穩打，一防務極爲鞏固。</p>

<h3>陳總長招待記者　上文接第一版</h3>
<p>共方要求問：總長對五人會議共方又提兩項要求，如何看法？答：請諸君回憶一月十三日停戰協定公佈後共軍之行動，即可知誰爲破壞協定者，舉凡大局，隴海路，以及李先念之出擊等，均係共軍先行攻擊而引起之戰鬥，設共軍停止其攻擊，國軍決不進攻，共軍所云停戰，最好之保證，即實行三人小組所簽訂之整軍方案，馬，張，周三氏之整軍方案中，本有三事互相關連，即停戰協定，恢復交通，與整軍方案，須同時實行是也。問：最近延安方面稱：西安軍事當局令十八集團軍辦事處撒回，究係何意？答：政府此舉乃全國性者，所有各軍辦事處均已奉令撤銷，非專對十八集團軍而有此舉。問：設司徒大使之五人會議有所成就，尊意是否認爲即可全面停戰？答：余極願五人會議有成就，如此則交通，停戰，以及其他一切問題皆有連帶解決之可能。問：共黨自宣布動員令後，共方佔領區內有何反應？答：余所知魚台民衆，對共軍已發生反抗運動，宿遷，睢寗等地潛伏之共軍，被當地人民綁送國軍，人民厭惡共軍之心理可見一斑。</p>
<p>所謂條件問：共黨要求取消五項要求，政府可吾答應？答：所謂五項要求，並非任何條件，整軍方案決定共軍在東北駐一個師，政府軍十四個師，六月七日共方要求在東北增爲五個師，經馬帥之折中增爲三個師，此可證明並非條件，乃整個計劃之改變，共軍在東北增加，別處自當減少；其决，共軍一定要求在東北佔多少省，多少縣，政府認爲東北多佔則其他方即應少佔，蘇北對京滬威脅太大，故請其讓出，結果共方提出者政府可以接受，政府提出者共方則拒不接受，故如能依照二月廿五日之整軍方案實行，則根本無任何條件可言。</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>印度的新生</h3>
<p>印度臨時政府主席尼赫魯業於本月二日在新德里宣誓就職。此一政府的成立，象徵着印度的新生。據報載消息，此一臨時政府雖以國大黨的領袖爲主席，其人選却包含錫克族代表，派西族領袖，以及回教基督教方面的代表，也可說具有充分的代表性。在他宣誓就任的時候，尼赫魯曾呼籲印度人民勿互相衝突，而常共同合作，態度光明，實在値得我們的讚佩。</p>
<p>中國與印度壤地相接。在過去交通梗阻的時候，巾印之間，還維持着交往，法顯玄奘等輩，曾不以關山的險阻和海洋的遼闊，遠去印度，這種堅毅的精神，使中印人民的關係趨於密切。今日印度境內的佛教流傳雖然已經幾乎絕跡，但佛教的思想却深印在中國人民的心間。茹素戒殺，輪迴涅槃的觀念，論其來源，均出印度，而這些觀念即在未受教育的中國鄕民間，至今還起着作用。在文化關係，中印間的關係實在可謂很深。在這次世界第二次大戰中，印度又爲我國際交通的主要路綫，中印間的關係更趨於頻繁。所以對於印度的新生，中國人民無不寄予極大的歡欣和期望。願中印人民，此後能够有更緊密的携手，共同致力於建設戰後的新世界，維繫戰後的持久和平。</p>
<p>我們覺得惋惜的是這次印度臨時政府的成立，不曾得到以眞納爲領袖的回教聯盟約合作，致臨時政府成立之日，即回民騷動開始之時。各地回民或則　掛黑旗，或則佩帶黑紗，遊行市街，以示反抗，且有流血事件發生，事態如何發展，此際尙難預料。回教聯盟的不合作固然末能削弱臨時政府的權力，因爲在臨時政府內已暫包有回教方面的代表，但有這一種不合作的政團存在，自然容易引起國內的不安。而况據合衆社孟買三日電，眞納向人表示，竟暗示蘇聯對印度事務或超過旁觀者之注意。可見印局實有關於整個中東形勢之演變。所以我們衷誠希望印度教的信奉者與回教聯盟雙方，都能相忍相讓，彼此能够覓取合作的途徑及基礎，使這次印度的新生能够不致遭受摧折。茲當印度臨時政府成立之際，我們謹於此表示我們的賀忱，並祝主席尼赫魯的政躬康泰。</p>
<h3>從配售到配給</h3>
<p>配售的最大缺點有二：（一）是貨價發生黑市；（二）是貨物流入黑市。</p>
<p>此中原因很多，諸如管制太鬆弛，計算欠精確，所有物資，無法把握得住等等；而最重要的，還是在於配價與市價相差得太遠，和所配的貨量太少，不足以應付實際的需要。　，因爲供不敷求，所以發生黑市；因爲黑市有利可圖，所以配得的貨物，不期而流入於黑市。那末，要消滅黑市，除掉合理的調整配價以外，當然要同時增加配額。配額倘或太少，除掉提高配價至黑市相等以外，始終無法消滅黑市。現在有許多配售貨，其配價常常機動，實際上竟無異跟隨黑市，其原因就在此。</p>
<p>糖價前天已調整了。現在黑市的食糖，已賣到二十萬元以外，而配價老是釘住在七萬元的原盤，這無異替投機商造機會。試看近來新設的糖行，忽然風起雲湧起來，道就可證明其中的暴利是何等優厚！</p>
<p>所以這次的調整，我們並不認爲驚與。所認爲驚異的，倒在於儘量配售這一點。果如當局所稱，今後將儘量配售，那末，此後的黑市，至少可希望緩和些，而這决所宣佈的配售價，也可望比較的持久些。</p>
<p>不過配售的目的，原在於節的物資，換句話說，就是物資不充，所以要辦配售，假如生產豐足，無　缺乏，那就該很可以自由買賣了。這次宣佈的配售辦法中，還有本市市民，將發給「購糖證」的一點，這是十分値得注意的一件事。此項購糖證如何發給，如何配購，其詳細辦法還沒有宜佈，我們自不必妄加揣測。不過有一點可以預先指出的，就是要從配售進展到配給了，我們知道：眞要節約物資，和求得合理的分配，的確非辦配給不可。配給是細密的，整個的，也是很科學的，與粗枝大葉的配售辦法大不相同。但是配給辦起來，也比配售難得多。當局旣有這決心，我們希望他準備要周密，分配要精確，最好另設一個機構，專門辦理此事。因爲應該配給的，實在不止食糖一項；可以配給的，也不止食糖一項，近來私人方面，常聽到這種主張，中央也彷彿有此計劃，似乎不妨從食糖做起，建立起一個規模來。</p>

<h3>拆息太重·客銷减退　棉紗黑市賡續下瀉　靑島貨竟遠低於紡建牌價　雙馬配售價昨又壓低八萬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗布市面，極度疲落，，紡建開紗，掛牌不動，計四十二支變股日光一九〇萬，三十二支雙股仙桃一八〇萬（筒子）二十支則實光草包一一五萬，而市塲價格，下跌殊甚，四十二支初减二一八萬，旋降至二一五萬，三十二支藍鳳仍喊一八〇萬，但無受主，仙子筒子紗市價反較紡建掛牌小去三萬，靑島貨卅二支宮女，竟以一百四十九萬五千成交，則較紡建開價反小去十餘萬元矣，雙馬昨日配價，已自一百四十萬，掛低至一百卅二萬，但配出之貨，仍不到千件，市上現貨一度降至一百四十七萬，較上星期已小去十七八萬，旋以廣帮乘康吸收，收市時回至一百五十二萬，其餘廿支各牌，約小三兩萬元，四十二支及卅二支細紗微降萬元之譜，人心仍未樂觀，緣海關有限止轉口之消息，聞自即日起，凡自本市購運棉紗布至廣東福建等處，須經關務署申請獲准，始准出口，至華南各地廠商，如有正當需要，將由紡織事業管理委員會訂定配給辦法，因此廣幫胃口　見减退，廠家實銷因節邊銀根奇緊，不敢動辦，號家均因銀根緊，拆息重，整不起單子，不惜貶價脫手，此紗價之所以大跌也，據紗廠業中人云，前次行政院救濟總署配給之花衣，已照新匯票結價，花衣市價前之為九萬餘者，今已漲至十六萬，且指陳照目下來本，可能漲至二十萬云，言下之意，大有應再行者漲之勢，但據實用廠家方面消息，現在紗廠集中派貨，一律先銀後貨，貨之派交，且未有把握，而每次申請購紗之時，無從得知其定價，認為在紗廠為自身計固得，若站在用戶立塲，則諸多不便云，故昨日民營紗廠集中派貨，申請者已不復如前次之踴躍。</p>
<h3>棉布忍痛斬售·亦由墊頭太重</h3>
<p>布市開盤極疲，迄午始定，其緣由係前晚紡建核准派貨，其二十支經偉之無牌細布，每家廠號，多有配着，墊不起銀子者非忍痛斬脫不可，所以紡建之以五萬三千元開派者，市價竟小至五萬一千元，有某某等染織廠趁疲檔收進不少，據熟悉市塲情形者言，昨日布價之跌，主因有三。（一）銀根奇緊，　　高至二角有零，號家自無意墊購，廠家亦望而却步，（二）紡建以五萬三千元之高價，掛售無牌貨，有人傳說此次身骨不佳，執單者更覺膽小，（三）前日請購無牌細布者，家家核准，轉手旣乏受主，放棄又恐拋棄開貨資格，削本二千，亦所不計，並據指稱，花色貨之未經開派者，價仍挺秀，四君子，直貢緞，售價七萬元，坯布氣勢，亦尚穩定。有地位之觀察家談稱，昨日紗布之小，全係銀根緊急所致，並據指陳，六底公　風潮時，銀根緊在金融業，現在則金融業早已預料中秋銀根當緊，藩離自固，且在外國變率後，政府又以收縮通貨為緊平物價之策，於是頭寸更緊，工商業更無餘力。</p>
<h3>公債回跌</h3>
<p>公債經報載財部關謠，漲勢未免稍受打擊，但五樓某大戶仍有代某銀行吸收統戊之訊，人心仍吿堅定，統丙晨開二五〇〇元，津幫仍來購納，曾升至二六八〇元，始被出籠，所遏止，中途低至二二九〇元，此後戊種形勢見俏，助長買方聲勢，近午又升至二四五〇元左右，結果較前收回跌二二〇元，甲乙丁丙各被帶小一五〇元。</p>
<h3>下半年救濟米　我國得廿八萬噸</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓三日電〕新近代替聯合國糧食局之國際緊急糧食委員會，對今年下半年救濟食米之分配頃決議作如下規定：（總數為一，三二四，〇〇〇噸）計中國二八〇，〇〇〇噸，印度二七〇，〇〇〇噸，錫蘭一八〇，〇〇〇噸，馬來亞一七〇，〇〇〇噸，及菲律賓一四五，〇〇〇噸，各小國亦將按照比例量配給，該委員會復強調稱，全世界食米之供求，仍患供應之不足，其七月至十二月份之配給量，若照規定量配給時，各食米消費國家尚可足敷食用。</p>
<h3>高粳盤升秈米平定</h3>
<p>米市來源仍續，惟各產區划申均不合算，販運客商興趣不濃，店方遇巧納取，秈米轉入定局，白元貨少俏俐，挺昂千餘元，新粳早色已少，晚色正値收割，在此一星期內，來貨難免見稀，今日以中次居多，高貨寥寥，盤升一二千元，陳白粳已成冷落之期，客貨登記南北市共五千餘石，社會局賡續拋售巴西米四百餘包，麵粉店胃轉淡，略呈疲勢，回小百元，小麥各貨消化淸懈，納胃不貪，各方以產消倒懸，不願貶售，形成僵局，黃豆汕頭停辦，來貨略有，相街進胃不爽，高貨平平，中次脩削三四百元，苞米客消不動，　豆回小千元，麩皮回小百元，油市步升一二千元，審議價格亦已寬放，因產地報昂，今日均照審議價格做開。</p>
<h3>人造絲激漲　比上日大十二萬元</h3>
<p>人造絲廠銷活躍，有光更呈俏利，昨市漲起十餘萬元，一二〇號天橋有光上午二百念五萬元開盤，吸收有人，提升至三十萬元收盤，然買戶仍絡續不絕，下午即做高至三十五萬元，最後同行做三十六萬元，賣出喊三十八萬元，比上日竟大起十二萬元之鉅，雜牌亦跟進，一五〇號有光搜求甚股，價比上日亦提高十二萬元，其餘半光等貨，大八九萬元不等，廠經市况較靜，做價盤旋與上日原價相仿，綢貨交易雖有，市價平穩無變化。</p>
<h3>紡建變更配售法　將以絲織廠為限</h3>
<p>紡建公司自開始配售人造絲以來，迄今已達十期，（每逢星期四配售）凡人造絲號及絲織廠商，均可申請，現該公司為免除黑市，以應絲織廠實際需要起見，特自十一期起（本週四），各人造絲號之申請配售，予以停止，今後將以專事配售絲織廠商為原則。</p>
<h3>白煤銷滯轉軟</h3>
<p>煤市白煤塊到貨仍稀，然銷路亦較前淸淡，市價平中帶軟，鴻基層本月份經濟部燃委會配價又減低一萬元，故各等白煤　均受影響，喊價雖未減低，銷路極呆，煙煤近日到貨仍受交通阻塞，市價雖無波動，市况則稍見帶緊</p>
<h3>蝦目陳貨吿罄</h3>
<p>向銷菲洲一帶之蝦目綠茶，茲據業中人云，彼地紛紛來電需貨，惟新貨成本高，難以出口，陳茶存底已將罄，故交易遂吿寂寞，　若陳袖珍，陳珍眉，陳針　，福建紅茶，邱門紅茶等，出口行依然收進，粗紅茶脫手亦順利，行市每担已狂跳至四萬八千元</p>
<h3>銀根緊迫聲中　證劵多無生氣</h3>
<p>華股因銀根尚在飄搖之中，人心脆弱，上塲時承前收餘勢而吿扳高，永紗開後抬至六七五元，美亞四〇三〇元，景福二五五元，新光二八〇元，勤興二〇〇元，較冷各中小型亦微挺前，近午遭多方了結，各股幾均回至低價結束，冷門中若中法商務搜求者湧尚現堅挺，餘者不免稍受影響，結果較前收計永紗美亞新光勤興都吿微降，景福本身支撑，跟風者甚多，獨漲半成，預定上市喊價，竟宣傳須在現貨一倍以上，亦屬怪現象也，較冷各中小型股除中法抬高半成，餘者均稍見低，元老股平衡均衡，商務續在挺進中。</p>
<p>外股跌風驟起，證劵帮中獲利了結，怡紗自一〇六〇〇元退至九六〇〇元，英聯自一二六〇〇元降至一一三〇〇元，其他各股跟縱於後，莫不趨疲，結果較前收計會德豐雖挫尚微，怡啤怡紗業廣略跌半成光景，英聯亞洲紙業綱業各跌一成左右。</p>
<h3>亞洲棉紡市場　日本仍是勁敵</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓三日電〕據國際紡織公司之報吿稱，現日本棉織品生產能力五分一及人造絲生產能力之三分一仍然存在，雖一九三九年存在之一二，三〇〇，〇〇〇紡綻，已有百分之七〇至八〇遭受破壞，但主要紡織機器製造廠中，尚有四家在一九四七年中仍有八〇〇，〇〇〇紡綻，及一六，〇〇〇，至一七，〇〇〇紡機之生產量，而彼等在一九四六年之生產品，尚未計算在內，戰爭結束時，日本潛在之人造絲生產能力，計達三五四，〇〇〇，〇〇〇磅，但以原料缺乏，其生產量已減低至一三，〇〇〇，〇〇〇磅，美國農業部頃評論稱，日本紡織業之勞工力量，仍然存在，如能獲得足量生棉之供應，則日本將能在亞洲市塲上與中國及印度互相角逐。</p>
<h3>銀根尚未回鬆·金鈔穩定不變</h3>
<p>烚赤昨穩定少變，晨開二〇五萬左右，開後人心尚好，逢低不乏買戶，自二〇四萬八升至二〇五萬八，中央銀行續施壓力，一度退至二〇四萬五，八後在二〇五萬內外徉徊，十時後中央銀行配給一八二條，價二〇五萬五，此後更形平庸，以迄午刻仍站二〇五萬以上，午後即交，突因銀根奇緊，遭斬多所壓迫，退至二〇四萬，隔日交割仍被拉上至二〇五萬以上，結果較前收微升，飾金紋銀銀元均平，暗拆初平後緊，暗息自一角七分至二角不等。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔甚為穩定，晨開三二九〇元至三三一〇元，中途曾微升至三三一五元左右，午刻仍在三三〇〇元光景徘徊，先後先後隨金市退至三二八〇元以下，最後尚平，結果較前收小二十元，港票自六九〇元回升至七一〇元左右，最後仍在七〇〇元內，結果亦小五元，港匯與港幣相同，印匯八四〇元，英匯一一二〇〇元有供給，少成交，美匯略有對做，在牌價之下少許。</p>
<h3>千倍給付存款問題　王曉籟氏發表書面談話</h3>
<p>國民參政會議政員，全國商聯會籌備主任王曉籟氏，昨對千倍給付存欵之法院判決，發表書面談話云，「余方由東北慰問及救濟同胞考察工商業並為全國商聯會籌備事宜歸來，正擬發表關於東北之觀感，乃先承新聞記者詢對於千倍給付存欵之法院判決，有何意見發表，余以行裝甫卸尚未詳細硏究為辭，茲於查閱各報所載之後，感想所及，以其影響甚巨，乃有下述之觀察」</p>
<p>（一）三十年七月一日公布施行之非常時期民事訴訟補充條例，已因三十四年十二月十八日公布施行之復員後辦理民事訴訟條例而失效，則根據現已失效之條例而來之司法院院字第二八八五號解釋例，及其後該院三十四年十一月二十一日院字第三〇一八號對行政院之咨覆，自亦失效。</p>
<p>（二）現行之補充條例，適用之對象，核其各項規定，似為淪陷區，因該區法院曾無法行使職權，訴訟未能進行，設此條例，乃所以補救社會之不平。</p>
<p>（三）關於現行補充條例第十二條之規定「法律行為成立後，因不可歸責於當事人之事由，致情事變更，非當時所得預料，而依其原有結果，顯失公平者，法院應公平裁量為增减給付或變更其他原有效果之判決」是否並無區域限定，似應先有硏究，因為在立法技術上，似乎不一致。</p>
<p>（四）三民主義之中華民國之立法，觀乎民法中之限制利息，與限制承繼，拋棄承繼，其精神與文字，偏向何在，均可明了，無庸贅述，則上述十二條之立法意志，亦可推想而知。</p>
<p>（五）至於情事，該有範圍，而謂貨幣之貶値，亦為情事之變更，似屬可通，但將置關於貨幣之特別法律於何地。</p>
<p>（六）所謂當事人，債權人，債務人，當均包入，即云貨幣之貶値，係　情事之變更，則此變更係屬常識，當時均得預料，然均無抗拒之力量，除非不愛國家民族換成外匯，存貯外國，設置物資房屋於國內，其可靠與不可靠，亦誰能預料。</p>
<p>（七）在投機賭博塲中有放一角過洋者，即一元每天一角，則一年三十六元，十年亦不過三百六十元，而不到十年一元要還一千元，似乎太失公平。</p>
<p>（八）倘使一元不作一元用，則從前錢洋並用之時，借洋者，在借據上，寫明借洋還洋，類乎美國後被取消之金條文，似比現在，高明得多。並且貨幣失去統一不變性，交易豈能成功，更其匯票期票存款放款均不能實現。</p>
<p>（九）我國幣制，將來如何改革，現可云極難預料，但決不致像第一次世界大戰後德國與英國，恢復金本位，因為管理通貨，正合國父孫中山先生貨幣革命之主張</p>
<p>（十）該條係關於經濟之條文，如其借款一定要增加給付，則農工商均將破產，我敢言若輩都為債務人，此當非該補充條例之立法原意也。</p>
<h3>收購生絲　先以一萬担為準</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕政府收購生絲，明令到滬，已誌前報，茲悉中信中　及中央銀行連日正在商討詳細辦法，聞原則已確定收購上級生絲一萬担，每担收價為三百八十萬元，詳細手續，短期內即可公布。</p>
<h3>農林部與農行合組農業機械公司　孔祥熙任董事長</h3>
<p>農林部為改進我國農業，增加生產，特與農民銀行共同發起籌組中國農業機械公司，該公司機械設備，係就聯總撥助之農業機器加以利用，技術方面，亦由聯總協助，該公司現已正式組織成立，由中國銀行董事長孔祥熙任董事長，農林部周詒春部長任副董事長，農民銀行總經理李叔明，農林部次長錢天鶴，中信局副局長沈熙瑞，及吳任滄潘光逈等任常務董事，並聘支秉淵為總經理，資金定為四億元，該公司並設農業機械廠若干，分佈於全國各地，已決定總廠設上海，天津廣州南京等十八處設分廠，總廠廠址設於軍工　，已着手修整廠房，下月即可開工，初步製造簡單農具，以適應農村需要，並低價批售農民。</p>
<h3>津漢川湘等幫搜購漂白粉漂粉精</h3>
<p>漂白粉漂粉精，前以滬市到貨甚擁，致價格慘跌，例如一〇〇市斤之小桶漂粉精，價曾高達每桶六十三四萬元，而二週前價曾回到每楹十二萬元，執有大量之定貨者，亦有忍痛以每桶八萬元斬割者，漂白粉更不堪聞問，每磅價格由三百餘元跌至一百廿元，實較滬地石灰價為廉，是以引起天津漢口及川湘贛各帮之扒吸，近以搜購甚力，致價格冉冉上升，據業中人云，漂粉精之輸入成本，每桶約為十七八萬元，故今後價難下跌，而外帮來滬採辦，多係認定牌子，如漂粉精則必為德貨億利頓，燒碱則為英貨月牌，美貨多不欲採辦，但現在市上，幾皆美貨，外帮因滬地工廠多已改用美貨，故客帮對商品牌子，成見似已　淡。</p>
<h3>市商會建議簡化鈔票式樣　旨在易於鑑別難於作偽</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市商會，迭據本市各業公會報吿：邇來市上時有偽鈔發現，偶失於檢，即蒙其害。茲復據進出口商業同業公會來函：亦發現同樣情事損失雖尚輕微，第恐日久，易滋紏紛。為防患未然，請為統籌善法，使收款付款雙方，免除無謂損失。爰經該會提交常務理事會議議決：以近來對於鈔票式樣繁多，大小參差，致使用者益感辨別為難，影響法幣之推行。已函致中央銀行發行局，嗣後發行鈔票，式樣應化繁為簡，改歸一律。俾作偽者失其微幸之機會，使用者易得鑑別之標準云。</p>

<h3>在舟山羣島上　三等軍港·頭等漁塲</h3>
<p>— 本報八月廿四日定海訊　特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>定海是舟山羣島的主島，全部一百八十五個島嶼，都歸定海管轄，她位於中國版圖上的東南海，是浙江最接近日本之一地，也是我國東南海岸的門戶，整個國家的海上堡疊。遜淸時曾請德國人來顧問設計建設海軍，在定海作爲海軍的一個根據地。並設砲台甚多，遍及於各重要島嶼，到鴉片之戰時，定海即被英軍佔領，後經淸政府再四交涉，將香港交換，始吿離去。臨行時，將砲拴帶走，這防禦砲就失掉了效用。一直到抗戰開始，敵人侵迫定海，而這許多大砲這是沒有利用。敵人佔領後，把鐵砲　去化鐵，鑄造另種的槍砲。現在舊基尙存，使人感有慚愧之至。</p>
<h3>敵在定海的措施　有說不盡的感想</h3>
<p>日本在空海，他重視這舟山羣島的價値，於是修築公路溝通全境，築造船　以備修理軍艦，挖掘泥工，排置海軍碼頭，裝置鋼管輸送淡水至海上、貯蓄軍需，加　軍備，佔用民地開飛機塲，面積爲一千六百畝。並將泗譙島佈置堅强的海空防禦基地，因爲泗瞧島爲海空必經之路。另在島上設置修理廠，在機塲上經常停有水陸兩用飛機多架，準備有大批魚雷和自殺艇，想在這空海島上背水一戰。</p>
<p>據當地人士講：一日軍在時，經常有大軍艦停泊港內」。此項大軍艦，的爲三千噸左右，因吃水不能過深之故。現在據海軍方面人告訴我：「僅接收五百餘噸的兵艦數艘，砲艦多艘，砲艦噸位僅二十五噸，爲放射魚雷用者、另自殺艇六十艘，其餘糧秣，彈藥，武器，裝備等倒很多」。現在自殺艇還堆放在飛機塲的一邊，這自殺艇身子甚小，船頭甚大，就在船頭裘貯藏炸藥，前進速率至快，由一人駕駛，如碰着火軍艦，就不顧一切，向人艦猛撞，必致回歸於盡。在飛機塲的裏面，散置着三隻水上飛機，也沒有人利用，任令　壞。我們鑒於敵人在定海的一切設置，眞有說不盡的感想，在這裏，我們慶幸敵人無條件投降較早，否則定海將在敵人的死戰下化爲灰燼，我們欣幸敵人並沒有在定海破壞，反而在定海作軍備上的建設。</p>
<h3>中國少壯空軍</h3>
<p>在艱難冗長的八年抗戰歲月中，誰也不能否認空軍的功績，這批空中的英雄，不但在職塲上表現了無比的英　，殺滅了頑强的敵寇，而且在國外也爭回了不少的榮譽。誰也不相信駕着司蒂曼練習機可以飛越駝峯，而我們的空軍，却平安地到達了中國；誰也不能信少年的中國空軍可以分列式排字飛行，而我們却做到了最艱難的排字飛行。誰也不相信能够飛到空防鞏固的日本去作戰，而我們却遠越重洋投送了人道的炸彈。他們的足跡遠至印度，英國，美國，他們的堅忍力足以叫盟邦人士讚美驚奇，叫敵人敬佩嘆服！</p>
<p>他們忘不了中國空軍的搖籃——杭州筧橋。所以每逢「九一」校慶，雖身在遠地，也必有一番熱烈的慶祝。</p>
<p>現在抗戰勝利了，他們回到了自己的母校基地。這個對抗戰有鉅大貢獻的中國空軍搖籃，該是我們全國人士心目中最崇敬的聖地。</p>
<p>下面幾張圖片，就是中國空軍在艱難冗長的八年歲月中如何由少年的時代成長到壯年？儲裕生。</p>
<p>圖片說明：（一）在美國加州受訓之我空軍（范昱集藏）（二）我靑年空軍在舊金山市區。（范昱集藏）（三）在印度慶祝抗戰勝利。（范昱集藏）（四）在滇迤受訓之航校學生。（范昱集藏）（五）本報特派員儲裕生，本報記者黃行天與航校竺主任樞壽，曹主任教官朝覺及空軍學生在機場留影。（盛澄世攝）（六）筧橋復校「八一四」空軍節游泳池修復，由該校教育長胡偉克夫人剪彩。（范昱集藏）</p>
<h3>可防禦亦可出擊　是最好三等軍港</h3>
<p>駐定海軍上校專員楊道釗吿訴我，「像定海這樣的設備，還只能說是海軍上的一個要港，一足稱爲軍港。不過敵人的意圖，是想把此處作爲軍港的，因為這　的門戶有島山作屏障，港內風平浪靜，可以防禦和出擊，確是最好的一個三等軍港」。</p>
<p>海軍少校參謀主任徐奎昭也在旁邊，他對我說：「敵人在此地是預備出擊，而在不得已時始防禦，因爲在他的自殺艇，魚雷，砲艦等的準備上可以看出來的，洞時，舟山主島定海，四週有小島護衛，形勢險要，海通曲折，可以隱避，如遇巨艦可在出擊後，避匿小島旁，大艦不易還擊。」</p>
<p>我所知道美國陸軍上將柯克氏曾來過此間，他對於道裏的地形甚爲讚美，他說定海實爲象山港的前哨，其重要性實逾於象山港。我們對於這富有軍事價値的定海，感着無比的興趣；定海城建在道舟山本島上，四週有良田，也有小小的丘陵，更有涓涓而流的溪水。城內街道整潔，商店的房屋雖爲舊式，但也很整齊，靜靜的一些也沒有煩囂之氣。這裏一百八十五個島上，有四十二萬人民，其中有一半都從事於漁業</p>
<h3>大漁塲與冷藏廠　漁產約六百萬担</h3>
<p>定海，她又是中國三大漁塲之一，即是海南島的南海漁塲，黃渤海的烟台漁塲以及舟山羣島的定海漁塲。定海的漁業有四大種：一爲大黃漁業，二爲小黃漁業，三爲帶魚業，四爲墨魚業，浙省府特設漁業局於此，派饒用泌爲局長，管理浙江沿海廿二縣，海岸綫長達六百餘海浬的漁業。單就定海的漁產，年的六百萬担以上，漁船的有三萬餘艘。我們來此時，正値冷月，漁船多半去載客載貨了，還有一些漁船停在定海之濱，桅桿林立。</p>
<p>曾去參觀冷藏廠，此爲鮮魚恐腐而冷藏者，廠裏分成一間一間的冷藏室，魚從海裏捕獲後，即剖腹將腸腑取出，然後處與冷藏室。他們就把牠並列在冷凍盤上，讓牠結成冰，再放入冷氣間，使牠保持最低的溫度，不致溶解，然後切成一條條的冰魚可以求售，或輸運到外面去。</p>
<p>漁民多半是窮困的，於是由魚行貸款給漁民，或由魚棧貸款給漁民，待漁汛收穫時，必須仍售將全部的魚賣給貸款的魚行家，那時貶價以購，漁民忍痛含淚的祗好出售了。另有魚廠，爲自已改造魚類爲鹹藏品或乾製品等，也有貸款與魚行，轉貸漁民，也有直接貸與漁民的。再由魚行貸給冰鮮般，冰鮮船再貸給漁民，漁汛後，由船向漁民收魚，再轉售與行的。這等等魚行都有佣金可收，都是剝削漁民的。這也是百千年前的舊習慣，而捕魚的方法也是千百年前的舊方法，行棧們口知一味的賺佣金，賺高利貸，而不知道予以改良的途徑，而漁民們在喘息不定謀生維艱的情形下，也只有守成規。</p>
<h3>漁汛不佳冰鹽貴　焦灼得無路可走</h3>
<p>我們曾到漁行繁盛區的沈家門考察，據熟悉者吿訴我：這裏在漁汛時，兩旁的漁船停得滿滿地，輪船都不易通過。上岸，見街道兩旁的房屋很整齊，也有西洋式建筑的，街道比較的寬敞，只是滿鼻子的魚腥，和一種人尿污水的混合臭味。</p>
<p>這裏八十多家魚行，今年因為一大風的關係，所以收不着魚，這是二十年來所未有的。魚行放出的款也收不回來，所以他們已在大聲疾呼，救濟漁民。</p>
<p>今年冰價貴，最高的要五萬元一担，鹽價也高。要七千多元一担，冰價貴，影響了冰鮮船，　價貴，影響了漁民的生活，而且海上不太平，時常遭人　　「買路錢」，或是需索「保護費」的，可憐的漁民們，捕魚像偸魚，不捕魚又還不出債。今春魚汛不好，漁民們更加焦急得走頭無路</p>
<h3>浙漁業局纔成立　新課題應加努力</h3>
<p>漁民的漁船，大多不是自己的，他們也向人租來，過漁汛後交還出租人修理，船租當然也不會小的。聽說有四十石米租一條船的，所以一條魚，從捕得後到吃的人嘴裏，其間經過不少的過程，也受了不少的剝削。</p>
<p>民們在盛大漁汛後，拿到一點錢、因爲心　裏的怨氣，於是大喝大　，也有嫖娼妓的、無非　順此痛快一下，眞是「今朝有酒今朝醉」啊！在漁民羣中，十分之九都不識字的、識字的人也不做漁民了，他們衣冠楚楚、是漁民的「代言人」了。</p>
<p>現在浙省的漁業局，才初初成立。關於如何改善漁民的生活？如何改良捕魚的方法？如何减少中間人的盤剝？如何保護捕魚人的安全？這些都是他們今後努力的課題。</p>
<p>舟山羣島，她是中國的良好軍港，她是中國的大漁塲塲，常前所發生的困難，我們希望能够獲得解決。庶幾我們沿海的這一連串島嶼能够發揮她的力量！（作於赴普陀舟中）</p>

<p>汽車殺人應訂專章</p>
<p>啓者：上海自勝利後，汽車殺人事件，愈演愈烈，項爲此事上市府當局書，請發表爲感。（上略）查上海市內汽車肇禍事件，逐漸增多，自美軍車與汽車互撞，陳某殞命；嗣後或衝至電車站上，或撞入牆壁之中，此僅就其駭人聽聞者而言。餘如三輪車，人力車，以及行路之人，被汽車撞及，因而斷頭折臂，肝腦塗地者，不知凡幾。甚至一日累積至三五次不等，而允以前夕故黨委張詠春烈士之夫人程定均女士，及其第二子張平蓀之死事爲允酷。夫在車馬紛馳之地，趦趄於馬路常中，因而被汽車撞死者，猶可諉爲咎由自取；若乃步行於行人道中，竟亦慘遭橫禍，則非日夕蟄處家中，更無他法可以免除災害。行路之人，無論行於何地，更無論所乘何車，均屬劍炊矛淅，觸處危機。鄙意今後即使交通條理井然，而汽車是否能不肇禍，仍不能併爲一談。觀於程校長，被撩之地，絕非交通繁雜之區則關於消弭汽車肇禍章程似當另爲規定，茲就管見所及，分別條陳於後：（一）詳查肇禍汽車之性質，以定交涉之方。肇禍汽車屬於何機關之所有，警局均有紀錄，然據報紙所載，，則以美軍軍用，國軍軍用，及善後總署所有者爲多，擬請嚴加交涉，務使其遵章就範，免肇事端。（二）限制行駛速率，幷訂違反懲罰章程，以資防範。汽車肇禍之原因，大率由於速率太高，而車之類別，則以吉普十居八九；查吉普車本爲盟軍軍用汽車，備有最優良之機器，以之馳騁戰塲，固屬異常敏捷，惟此時此地何用開足馬力，急馳直驅？擬請明訂行駛速率，幷訂違反懲罰章程，飭知警局嚴格取締，在深夜及人烟稀少之馬路，允宜減低速率，以免肇禍。（三）禁止十輪大卡車在市中心區行駛，查十輪巨型卡車在外國原爲公路上運輸之工具，本不當在鬧市通行，况上海街道窄狹，車馬繁多，行駛其間，最易肇禍，擬請設法禁止，以策萬全。（四）對於特殊機關之司機，一體嚴加甄別，以照愼重。查美軍及善後總署所雇之華人，俄人，司機，及軍事機關之司機，是否經警局按章發給駕駛執照，及是吾受警局管理，雖無從道揣，然旣橫衝直撞，殺人如麻，自應設法取締，擬請飭知警局，一體嚴加甄別，幷於合格發給執照時，諄切吿誡，務使其謹愼從事，免肇事端。（五）嚴禁越車行駛，以維秩序，查上海在抗戰前，租界捕房嚴禁汽車越前行駛，不獨秩序井然，且肇禍之事亦少，現在汽車在馬路中行駛，爭先恐後，錯亂參差，以致傷人互撞事件，層見疊出，擬請嚴行禁止。（六）取締肇禍逃車：查上海肇禍汽車，往往於肇禍後，不獨不停車救護被撞之人，且開足馬力逃逸，以致心慌手亂，連傷數人，此種悄形如不加有效制止，則肆無忌憚，何以保行人之安全，擬請飭知警局，嗣後如遇肇禍逃車，不服停止命令者，應即發槍警吿，再不服從，即擊破輪胎，一面將此項辦法，通咨美軍部及國軍司令部，請其轉令各司機一體知照。（七）嚴辦肇禍司機，以照烱戒：查在租界時代，汽車肇禍之事件不多，撞傷行人之司機，其處罰僅罰　而止，今則肇禍之事件多而且烈，如此次畢勳路之慘案，連傷二命，使張詠春烈士家庭陷於絕境，遣孤失所憑依，如此兇惡之司機，即極刑亦不足以蔽其辜，豈薄罰所能了事，擬請嗣後對於肇禍之司機，視情節之輕重，由警局向法院提起過失殺人之公訴，以咨懲罰，而儆效允。（八）由市政府會同市黨部發起安全運動，週在通衢懸掛標語，並印製中英文勸吿司機傳單，或另加插畫，由崗警遍發司機，俾資警惕，以上僅就其大體而言，至應如何詳訂章程，則鈞府自有權衡，非市民所能越爼，現在此項汽車殺人事件，仍在繼續進行，如不急謀制止之方，則誰能足不出戶，人人自危，乞急招會議，立付施行，縱不能完全消除，亦當使其相當减少。（丁瑞侯）</p>

<h3>日戰犯酒井隆判决書　續昨日本報第九版</h3>
<p>並有東南亞盟軍統帥部駐香港第四十三墓地登記組組員砲兵少尉，約翰雅力杜堅，在香港赤柱·黃泥浦坳·淺水灣等處，發掘墳墓，起出被殺俘虜之屍體數十具，及在遺骸堆中發見圈成手銬之巳銹鐵綫，攝成照片可憑。復經身歷其境之鄒魯夫人趙淑嘉及鄒越夫人程慕貞到庭，將當時目繫暴行，痛陳如繪。又被吿所屬部隊在九龍一帶，虐殺姦掠，以及縱犬哎人等兇殘行爲，除經證人丘日仁績證明確外，尙有阿根廷駐港領事署代表拉佛力。（R．M．Lavale）之報吿書可資佐證</p>
<p>關於刧奪我國珍藏圖書，亦有國立北平圖書館之函件可據。綜上而觀，是被吿在華北港粵實施侵略戰爭縱兵肆虐行爲，殊屬衆證確　無可諱飾。雖其持爲抗辯之理由，有下列三點：（一）謂要求撤退河北駐軍，罷免河北行政首長係根據辛丑條的。（二）謂參加作戰，係奉日本政府之命令。（三）謂本人對於部屬之暴行，並不知情，焉能負責。但關於第一點，查辛丑條約並無禁止我國在河北省駐紮軍隊以及日本有權要求罷免河北省行政首長之規定，至該的所附天津換文第四段，亦僅爲避免中日軍隊衝突起見，而就雙方在天津駐紮地點設有二十華里距離之限制，乃被吿竟以該項條約　爲日本有權要求我國撤退河北駐軍及罷免河北行政首長之主張，顯屬故爲曲解。關於第二點，按侵略戰爭，係破壞國際和平之行爲，縱令被吿奉命參加，原已不能諉卸罪責。况在作戰期間，縱兵肆虐，更屬違反國際戰爭法規·奚容藉口政府命令，希岡解免。關於第三點，揆諸國際慣例，作戰長官，對於部屬之行爲，有嚴格監督及管束之責任。被吿怠於監督部屬之行動，並忽其管束職責，已難辭咎。矧在港粵督戰，閱時將及二載，其部隊之暴行，遍及東南，謂爲毫無所聞，更屬不近情理。且就其已俘部屬野間金之助大佐所供：「原限兩日攻陷香港，但因軍團進展遲緩，致費八日之久，曾受嚴重之譴責。酒井中將定能悉知所有日軍之暴行」等語。以及駐港加拿大軍醫隊上尉醫官史丹利馬田斑夫宣誓所稱：「曾有日本軍官本田能操英語，當面聲明軍令如山，一切俘虜均須就戮」之供詞。曁被吿在審判中承認當時知悉其部旣在聖史蒂芬斯醫院戮俘事實之供述，參互而觀，允足見被吿對於其部屬之暴行，係屬知情故縱。其所以在港島作大規模之屠殺，係由於圍攻八日始獲登陸，積憤難消，乃不惜出此，以示報復，亦屬灼然，尙何有掩飾之餘地？是其種種抗辯，無非狡展圖卸，毫無可採。按尊重中國主權之獨立及領土與行政之完整，為華盛頓九國公的第一條所明定。又斥責以戰爭爲施行國家政策之工具，在巴黎非戰公約第一條並揭有明文。乃被吿初則唆使奸黨，擾亂平津，以武力迫我撤退駐軍，罷免行政長官，並主張華北五省獨立，迨率部轉戰徐州廣東後，又扶植僞軍，助長僞政府之勢力，始終參預侵略戰爭，僭竊我國主權，破壞我國領土與行政之完整。顯屬違背上開國際公的各規定，自應成立破壞和平罪。爰予比照我國刑法第一百零一條第一項關於以暴動方法竊據國土僭奪主權罪所定之刑科處。至其在作戰期內縱兵屠殺俘虜·傷兵·紅十字會醫師·護士·及其他非戰鬥人員，並肆施强姦·搶刦·流放平民，濫用酷刑，及破壞財產等暴行，係分別違反海牙陸戰規例第四條至第七條第廿三條第三項第七項，第廿八條，第四十六條，第四十七條，及日內瓦公的第一搽至第六條，第九條，第十條各規定，應構成戰爭罪及違反人道罪。雖前開各種暴行，在我國刑法上均有相當條文可資比照，然查被吿對於部屬之暴行，一再知情故縱，無非企圖恃虐立威，征服人民，以達其侵略戰爭之目的。其係基於一個槪括之犯意極爲明顯。所有縱兵殺戮姦掠等暴行，不過爲其整個肆虐行爲之態　，亦即其概括犯意之實現。根據法條競合及特別法優於普通法之原理原則，自應歸納各種暴行而比照陸海空軍刑法第卅四條關於縱兵肆虐罪之規定處刑。又查被吿破壞和平，參預侵略戰爭，因而違反人道及戰爭法規，其罪行具有方法結果之關係，應從一重處斷。按被吿處心積慮，從事侵略工作，迭以陰驚手段，勾結挑撥，引起蘆溝橋七七事變，爲此次世界大戰之導綫。致演成歷史上空前之浩刦，已屬違反國際正義，破壞世界和平。且於作戰期內，蹂躪港粵，鋒鏑所至，生靈塗炭，村里爲墟。尤以剖腹，抉目，凌遲，刴屍之殘酷手段，加諸迎降俘虜，殘廢士兵，救傷人員以及無辜平民，更　慘絕塵寰，實爲人類之蟊賊，文明之公敵，窮兇極惡，無可寬貸。應予科處極刑，以昭燜戒。</p>
<p>據上論結，應依戰爭罪犯審判辦法第一條，第八條，刑事訴訟法第二百九十一條前段，華感頓九國公的第一條，巴黎非戰公約第一條，海牙陸戰規例第四條至第七條，第二十三條第三項，第七項，第二十八條，第四十六條，第四十七條，日內瓦公約第一條至第六條，第九條，第十條，陸海空軍刑法第三十四條，刑法第一百零一條第一項，坊五十五條，判決如主文。本案經本庭檢察官陳光處蒞庭執行職務。</p>

<h3>世界航空站：香港</h3>
<p>— 本報廿四日香港航訊　特約記者凌芳</p>
<p>據路透社訊，英國航空公司飛艇「漢密頓號，」定於八月二十四日，載客十六名由倫敦波爾機場，以四日時間，作八·三五二哩飛行，駛往香港。此爲該公司遠東「龍綫」的開幕。以後每週一班，由英倫直飛香港。不久，每週將增開一班，並由香港伸展航程至上海，而其最後目的地則爲柬京。</p>
<p>龍綫之重要地位</p>
<p>戰後香港和歐美各地的正式定期航空綫，尙以這個美國航空公司的「龍綫」爲嚆矢。英軍重入香港後，從日軍手裏奪回啓德機場，一面着手開闢平山機場，計劃在香港設立一個世界航空站。啓德飛機塲經過日人三年的經營，拆卸九能城三千家民房，築成兩條長達二千碼的跑道，作十字形，足供四引擎的巨型運輸機升降，（戰前只有一條八百碼的跑道），但還未够接納最新式的巨型郵機，因之英當局決心選擇新界屛山一帶農村，改築一個具有長五千碼跑道的大機場。可是平山鄕民誓死反對，釀成驚撼國際的屛山機場事件，英廷使於本年四月，宣佈放棄建築。英人在新界錦田，戰前築有一個機場，但爲地勢所限，無從擴展。聽說現已另擇地點，準備開築一個符合現代國際民航機塲標準的大機場，建築費達四百萬鎊，預期三十個月完成，因經費和其他關係，港府和英國殖民部還在商討中，目前無法宣佈建設工程何日開始。新機場地位，港府也保守秘密，大概總在我國寳安縣屬的新界租借地之內吧。</p>
<p>水陸兩用的機塲</p>
<p>在標準大機場開築前，啓德機場尙可負起香港航空港現階段的責任。據一個有經騐的駕駛員說，啓往德機場，是與上海江灣機塲媲美，而壓倒廣州天河機塲。啓德機塲，一邊靠獅子山，一邊臨九龍灣，是一個水陸兩用，設備週全的航空站，殆非一般祗供陸機使用的機塲所能及。</p>
<p>漢密頓號的設備</p>
<p>英國海外航空公司的倫敦香港綫採用飛艇飛行，今天啓程港來的「漢密頓號」，裝有四個引擎，機重五萬五千磅，載客十六人，船員六人，時速一百七十哩，機內有睡床十六張，梳化椅十六張，分爲四室，上層另有一個房間，內設酒吧，餐房，廚房，厕所，佈置新式，供應便利。每逢星期三由港開出，票價單程一百七十鎊，來回票三百零六鎊。貨運費每公斤十七先令逾限行李，每公斤收一鎊十四先令。倫敦與香港間的交通，自是更形密切。戰前英國海外航空公司的遠東綫，以英倫至澳洲綫爲主幹，另建星加坡香港支綫，以資聯絡，所以這回倫敦香港直接通航，還算是有史以來的首次。</p>
<p>汎美公司的表示</p>
<p>戰前除英國海外航空公司外，汎美航空公司也在港设站。太平洋戰事爆發那天，汎美航空公司的「夏威夷號飛前襪」，就在啓德機塲的水上浮站侧，作了日本炸彈的犧牲品。戰前汎美航空公司的橫渡太平洋錢，由舊金山出發，經檀香山，中途島，域克島，關島，馬尼剌而至香港，全程需時六天。戰後因英美航空權益，未成協議，所以遲遲未有復航。香港寄往美國航郵，祗由英倫，轉駁。過去一度盛傳，美方計劃在澳門设站，以代香港，但本港美領事處已對記者正式否認這個消息。最近英美遠東航空權益，似已獲致妥協，汎美公司駐港人員，日前表示兩月內將可派機恢復港美直接通航，但仍須等待華盛頓民事航空局的批准。</p>
<p>據說汎美航空公司戰後把橫渡太平洋綫，分爲南北兩綫。北綫經檀香山，阿拉斯加，東京，上海而至香港。南綫則經檀香山轉澳洲，荷屬東印度，星加坡，馬尼刺而至香港。汎美航空公司，最近已派機由美渡大西洋，經歐陸而至印度，正式開航紐的新德里綫，作爲全球航綫的一段，將來伸展至星加坡，便連接北太平洋綫或南太平洋綫而完成環球綫的飛行，香港也就成爲環球綫主要聯絡站之一。</p>
<p>港航空綫的發展</p>
<p>除中國，中央，英國海外和汎美四家航空公司外，即將在港設立航空綫者，還有西南民航公司，菲列賓遠東航運公司和亞洲航空公司。（遠東航運公司已於今日派「天空主人」巨型機作菲港綫處女航，安全抵港，全程祇費二小時。）後兩公司的馬尼刺香港綫，都已非正式通航多次。而中國航空公司，近亦有意派機開闢香港星加坡綫香港加爾各答綫。以香港爲中心的遠東航空網，現已次第完成。中英美航空事業，勢將掀起一塲激烈的競爭。</p>
<p>港府爲適應這個新環境，定於下月恢復啓德機塲附屬的遠東航空訓練學校，造就航空人材。該校戰前已成立數年，我國學生在其中畢業的，計有百餘人，現多服務於國內航空界。該校舊職員經已大半返港，今後改各遠東航空訓練學院，九月一日正式開始招生。校中課程計分飛行班與機械班兩部。據該學院總工程師屈君對記者說，學院復校之初，儀器和各種機件，尙未完備，擬先開辦飛行班，機械班須俟各種器材運到，然後恢復。該校已向英倫訂購新式練習機三架，下月內將可運抵本港。</p>
<p>籌劃建築大機塲</p>
<p>香港因爲具有優越的地理條件，海運時代已爲世界主要港口之一。戰後展開了航空時代，港府便迎頭趕上，籌劃建築適合　標準的大機塲，企圖力保牠在國際交通上的地位。恰如海運需要深水的港灣，空運則需要廣闊的基地，前者廣州賽不過香港，後者香港却比不上廣州。國際航空綫戰後多改用陸機而不用水機，美國C69式巨型陸機。便無法在現下的香港機塲降落。傳說汎美公司最近已轉移目標於廣州，是否屬實，尙待證明。但我們必須配合客觀環境，加緊整頓廣州的航空設備，在航空的交通上這回萬萬不能再讓香港佔上風！</p>

<p>勝利以後，駱氏初次爲上海讀者們所熟悉的，是他的短篇小說集「北望園的春天」；他那種舒緩，纖麗；非常別緻的風格，曾爲許多愛好文藝的靑年們所喜悅和倣傚，同時取材現實；充滿了濃厚的地方色彩，這在荒蕪的文壇上，無疑是珍貴的收獲。「罪證」和「北望國的春天」比較起來不論內容和風格上，要嚴肅得多了；後者雖然缺少春天的溫馨和沁香；可是牠祗少還讓我們嗅到一些春天的氣息，而「罪證」却像一塊沉甸甸的烙鐵，水京也壓在我門的心靈上；酷寒而又沉重；那些不愉快的噩夢，又明明清淸地在眼前映現出來；在勝利後的失望中過去的仇恨，加上面臨的危機，誰又能不顫慄而畏懼呢？許多血雨猩風的嘶殺過去了，許多生命和寳藏廉價的喪失了；這些好像剛消逝過的，又好像在久遠以前；但決不是夢境，在人類所能聽得到的聲音中，我們終於聽到了最慘厲的囈語，那是因壓迫威脅而致瘋在的，勇士們的囈語；他們直到今天，還被困在自己幽暗的屋子裏，口口聲聲地申辯着，求恕着，怒吼着；他們從來也沒有犯過罪，可是他們被懲罰的比死刑還要殘酷；「罪證」中的主角，就是這樣遭遇到的：</p>
<p>一九三一年春天，吳占奎在北方高級中學畢業後，懷着一顆熱烈的求知心，以及對大都市生活的熱望，來到北平；他考取了北平大學的法學院；在學校裘，他對政治不感興趣，從未有所活動，每天按時拿了書本，到課堂聽講上課，假期或空閒的時候，常到戲院子裏聽京劇，散塲了，往往嘆口氣，就算表迷他內心的贊美和愉快；這年冬天，他打算到關外的故鄉來度假期，「他第一次感到胸襟的輕快，第一次望見冬季天空下的一望無際的雪野。沿途那些頂尖露出木把高的草枝，那些在雪地上低飛的寒雀，想着時光的交替，想着離家一年，異鄉作客的日子，想着故鄉裏的小友，恐怕都隨着歲月變化了。」吳占奎微笑了，他覺得自己該怎樣用功，才不辜負這寳貴的靑春……他在天津辦理「入國證」（入滿洲國的）的那天；才開始注意到東三省事變對自己的影響，溥儀的回鑾大典却不是文字上的東西了，在到達大連的傍晚。吳占奎和其他十一個知識靑年的「入國證」被扣留了，他們被中國通譯官所審問，沒有事實的證明，沒有分辯的餘地，就憑着敵人一己的猜疑，他被解入監獄，兩腿加上刑具；五年中間，吳占奎衰老了，憔悴了：「他的眼請中顯出極大的不靜和空虛，他不再有學術上的慾望，也失去了靑春的孤傲。彷彿他對世界上沒有一點兒希求。只是注意着小窗口的亮光，看看是不是好發囚糧了，聽着隔壁的脚步聲，聽聽是不是有新的囚犯關進來，還是有老囚犯得到提審的幸福偶爾有燕子閃過，他知道是春天了，然而春天又離得他那麼遙遠，偶爾院心出現一片落葉，他感到秋天了，然而秋夭又是那麼渺茫。」…直到「滿洲國王」大赦的日子，他才被驟放出來，就在剛出獄的一刹那，他曾爲了廣闊的馬路，人羣，牲口，車輛，錄的樹，亮的電燈，以及火紅的夕陽和海邊的暮靄所暈眩。吳占奎被他妹妹玉芳接到老家琿春後神智一直恍恍惚惚，他所能記憶得起的友人全變了；他的教師李漢臣，吸上雅片成了無賴；好友金立吾也是烟鬼：而且三句不離生意經，老想和日本人合作賺大錢。他的精力已經不能使他注意到這些瑣事。他所聽得淸的，祗有金立吾臨走時講的話：「有特務密查跟你。」因此吳占奎在頓刻之間，迷離沘沌起來，他不能安心地待在家裘，也不睡眠，他完全瘋狂了，被他的父親用麻繩綑縛起雙手，關閉在房裏。就在這天晚上占奎的父親大鵬趕到朝鮮地帶去收豆子，準備在日本和露西亞（蘇俄）開戰的時候，可以多得些利益；可是他迷失了方向，走到朝鮮國境裏去了，他被拘禁了一夜，第二天被日本警察押解起來，而且病倒了。</p>
<p>最後，吳大鵬死了，占奎瘋了，玉芳也從此不多說話了，她老是緘默又挹鬱地趕着活兒。他們都不曾犯過罪，是那兒來的「罪證」要懲罰他們呢？當我在讀完這本書的時候，我才眞正覺得人類最渴望的，莫過於「眞理」兩字；法西斯，以及和牠相似的惡魔，到什麼時候消滅呢？牠殺害了無辜的年靑人，叫他們不死不活，精神上蒙受到虐待和創傷；有人說：「祗有瘋狂的人是痛快的，他們可以毫無忌憚地笑和哭。」可是瘋狂者的　語，遲鈍的眼光却明明顯露出永世的哀怨。又有人說：「社會適合不强不弱者生存，一切中庸主義者是不會發狂的，也不會滅亡的……祗有瘋子走到滅亡，因爲他是强者，而又是弱者，他是弱者，然而又自以爲强者……據說現在發瘋最多的就是靑年了。」因此我們需要爲靑年人爭取他應享受的歲月，他不能隨意被壓迫發狂！</p>
<p>駱賓基在這本小說中，暫且收藏起他纖柔的手筆，但仍保存了流利和細膩的特點，他把瘋狂者的心理，動作，刻劃得生動非常。我們很可能想象得出，一個忠實的文藝者，在他用血淚和悲憤，描摹出那些殘酷的事實時，是怎樣熱烈地懷着「控訴」的心情，是的；他在「控訴」，在「控訴」這「莫須有」的「罪證」。</p>
<h3>國際公法的將來怎樣</h3>
<p>— 孫杭</p>
<p>一九四二年春，整個世界還在爲了戰爭焦灼頭痛的時候，若干美國和加拿大有心世道的人士，却已在開始討論戰後的善後問題了。他們是一羣國際公法學者，大約有近二百人，先後在紐約，芝加哥，費城，華盛頓，舊金山等等地方開了十八次會議。討論的中心問題便是『國際公法的將來應是怎樣？』</p>
<p>經過了澈底的和再三的商討，他們才發表了一個報吿，作爲他們共同的意見。這報吿由卡內基國際和平基金委員會編輯成書，名曰「國際公法的將來」。我國吳澤炎氏已譯成中文，由商務印書館出版。</p>
<p>這書除引言前言外，分成三大部分。第一是將來國際公法的基理，「就是在國際社會中成立和維持一種有效的法律制度所必不可缺的前提。」第二是將來國際公法的原則，這些原則可以是「關於未來國際公法宣言的一個草案。」第三是將來國際公法的提議，便是「執行上述原則所可以採行的若干措置。」</p>
<p>前兩部分是比較抽象的，理論的。所以，以對於國際公法有切實的貢獻而論，最後的提議無疑是較具體而有價値。</p>
<p>國際公法的發展，本應和世界情勢的變遷配合着的。有時候，人類受够了教訓，吃盡了痛苦，想要救救自己，甚且要想法創造能够藉以獲得和平和安全的國際公法，來領導世界情勢的變遷。因之，國際公法的發展，不單依靠着國際關係的發展，也須以人類的智慧和需要作為推動的因素。</p>
<p>爲此，國際公法不應再是不自主的產物如習慣法一樣了，他應該是人爲的一件工具，作爲開發人類前途的一種幫助。人類要用國際公法使世界從戰爭走向和平，便要加意創造國際公法，而不是承認茶種習慣的國際公例。</p>
<p>這本書便是對國際公法一的種創造。他的話都是以世界和平和法律秩序的立塲出發，有些地方，是革了現存國際公法的命；有些地方，是根本建立了一種新的國際公法。</p>
<p>（一）對現存國際公法革命—國際公法上有一個很複雜的問題，便是國家主權和國際公法的關係是怎樣？依照傳統的說法，國家是國際構成的一員，國際公法對她有拘束力，必須先得她的同意。換句話說，國家可以考慮該項國際公法是否有損及她的主權而決定取捨。這個傳統是有很大的缺點的，因爲這樣一來，國際公怯便屈服在主權之下，國際間的合作和秩序，也不得不以國家利益爲依歸了。</p>
<p>從前已有許多人提議把國家的主權削減以適合國際的合作，如英國的拉斯基教授便是其中的有力份子。現在這本書裏更有進一步的主張，他的基理第三條後段說：「一個國家的主權，受國際公法的限制。」這豈非革了傳統國際公法的命嗎？</p>
<p>（二）創造新國際公法——國際公法的拘束力常嫌薄弱，因為它不像國內法一樣有一個立法機關和司法機關。雖國際永久法庭成立後，名義上司法機關是有了，但立法機關則始終仍付缺如。</p>
<p>這本書的提議七於：「全體會議經三分之二的票決，和得到行政院的同意，應有修正國際公法一般規則和執行新的國際公法一般規則之權。」這便是國際公法的立法機構，是國際公法上的一種新創造。</p>
<p>統觀全書，諸如此類富有革命性和創造性的議論是很多的。對於國際公法喜歡研究的人，威者說，對於人類有心關切的人，這本書確是組成你們救世思想或救世方法的有價値的參攷。</p>

<h3>刦餘圖書館的重建</h3>
<p>— 趙震譯</p>
<p>爲了復興戰區人民的知識生活起見，美國現正以大量的圖書雜誌救濟歐洲及遠東各國的圖書館和學術硏究機關。爲了重建被德國人和日本人所任意及故意破壞的圖書館，美國公私團體機關已從事搜集大量學術性的圖書雜誌，預備裝運至各國。在此次戰爭中，被燬及遺失的圖書，總計有兩萬萬之多。在波蘭有百分之七十的圖書館被燬與被刦掠。在捷克，南斯拉夫，有一牛以上的圖書館被燬。蘇俄損失五千萬卷圖書。在中國和菲律濱，日本人除了把他們自己所需要的圖書搶歸日本之外，把其除所有的書都　滅了。</p>
<p>遭戰爭破壞的國家，其學者專家們和學術的新發明新進步失掉了接觸。他們知道近年來科學上有極大極多的發明，可是他們無法可以硏究。因此，美國各大學，各教育團體，各圖書館，各政府機關，在戰爭初起時，早已着手搜羅圖書，以便在戰後運贈給各國。</p>
<p>洛氏基金社的捐贈</p>
<p>一九四一年五月洛氏基金社　　美國圖書館協會所設之戰區圖書館救濟組，定購整套雜誌，以便捐助各被害國家。自一九四一年以來，美國圖書館協會已動用卅萬元美金定購三百六十五種專門性的雜誌，年定三萬五千七百十份定期刋物，其中九十多份是醫學雜誌。這些雜誌和其他各機關各私人所捐助的雜誌已一同運送至各國了。</p>
<p>在書籍方面，洛氏基金社已撥款廿萬元美金，購買了卅五套專門著作，每套有七百五十種專門書籍，預備送給中，英，俄，法，義，波蘭，捷克…等國。現在又已準備好了一張定書單，選定了一千六百種專門性質的參考書，特別是最近十年來出版的新書。共中自然科學和應用科學的書佔百分之六十，人文科學和社會科學的書佔百分之四十。</p>
<p>美國各地的救濟機關和救濟計劃旣日漸加多，為謀資金之善用與通力合作起見，需要有一個能作通盤籌劃的中心機關。於是在一九四五年四月於華盛頓之國會圖書館中設立了一個「美國圖書救濟處」，其任務是統驚國外圖書館救濟工作，調查外國圖書館被燬之情况及其所需，搜集圖書，接洽運輸船隻。「美國圖書救濟處」企圖於一九四六年內能運送一百萬至三百萬册書籍雜誌至國外。此大量之書籍都是全美國人民所捐贈的。他們現在又在進行一種募捐運動，要徵求四百多種專門雜志，四十八州中每州都有一個書籍採集站。</p>
<p>各國政府的努力</p>
<p>歐洲各國的政府都已在美國定購了大批書籍。中國教育部亦已定購了廿套。每套有一百九十五種專門雜誌。百分之八十是替國立北平圖書館定的，百分之卅是替國立地質調查所所定，國立淸華大學則已定購了價値一萬二千元美金的新書。</p>
<p>蘇俄亦在美國定購若干種圖書雜誌，每種各定購六十本。</p>
<p>戰區被燬圖書館之救濟工作，雖大半是民間私人的努力，但美國國務院也曾援助過近東及遠東各國。當戰爭正在進行時，國務院曾按月贈送七十五種專門科學雜誌的攝影本子給中國。那時交通極度困難，這些救濟品必須經由空運飛越喜馬拉耶山而輸入中國。自一九三七年以還，美國國務院捐贈中國的書籍巳將價値五萬元美金了。</p>
<h3>圖書的整理</h3>
<p>— 危言</p>
<p>美國的國會圖書館現在正忙着向全國出版界徵求書籍，加以歸類整理，然後分贈給全世界戰後復員的許多國家。足見盟國對於戰後建設的各方面都在平均的發展。但是在我國我們不幸而剛好發現了一個悽慘的對照。據說當上海市立博物館剛接收的時間除了幾個空洞的房間之外別無長物，負責的人也因爲市庫的拮拙而無法發展。當然，連飯都吃不飽的國家而侈談文化建設似乎是多餘的事。不過國家的建設無論如何卻應該是多方面平衡發展的。目前社會的需要我們一定要顯及，但是將來永久的大計也不能沒有準備。這種準備工作就要從硏究學術入手。</p>
<p>講到學術研究，我們覺得太可憐了。非但實騐儀器談不到，即多找幾本書看看就勢不可能。全國各大學可說沒有一個完備的圖書館。戰後古籍的散佚無法重新搜集起來，這不必說，即使欲求一個收藏全國最近出版物完備的岡書館，便可說是踏破鐵靴無處覓。本來學術的空氣就不够濃厚，再加上少數想讀書的人們不是沒有錢買書讀，便是沒有地方借書讀。請問這個社會怎能長進？</p>
<p>所以我們希望在國家方面能拿一部分錢出來購買外國書籍分贈各大都市的圖書館和全國各大學；在國內的出版界方面，每次出版新書最好能贈送各大圖書館或給它們一個很大的折扣；在各城市中設立一個比較完備的圖書館，多做一點整理和搜集圖書的工作。我們要保持中國幾千年來以文化立國的精神。</p>

<h3>談崑曲山坡羊</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>我學唱崑曲，常遇到商調山坡羊，最膾炙人口的雷峯塔「斷橋」，漁家樂「藏舟」，牡丹亭「驚夢」以及玉簪記「問病」。後二齣唱法與前二齣不甚同；前者悲哀中帶有激越，後者則悲哀中帶有織綿。商調屬於秋，原是帶有肅殺的秋意或哀愁的。</p>
<p>因爲能唱山坡羊，便檢閱集成曲譜中所有的山坡羊。根據僅有的十齣，再加上一齣與衆曲譜裏的問病來做結論，也許是危險或不甚可靠的。我姑且寫下來，以備他日作更詳盡的歸納。我所看到的特殊現象如下：</p>
<p>（一）山坡羊兩支大的即可獨立成套。且不帶尾聲。</p>
<p>梁辰魚浣紗記「養馬」是這樣的，玉簪記問病也是這樣的。</p>
<p>（二）山坡羊常與別的宮調聯套，很少與木調聯套的。</p>
<p>在這十一齣裏，山坡羊下常用仙呂，仙呂入雙調，雙調，正宮，中呂，黃鍾，越調，甚至用羽調，但用商調的，只有斷橋一齣。</p>
<p>（三）山坡羊與仙呂或仙呂入雙調聯套者最多。</p>
<p>占花魁「賣油」山坡羊是與仙呂皂羅袍，解酲甘州，皂角望鄕聯套的。但皂角望鄕的前面插了一曲仙呂入雙調玉抱肚。牧羊記「看羊」山坡羊是與仙呂入雙調夜行船序，黑麻序，錦衣香，漿水令聯套的。雷峯塔「斷橋」是與仙呂入雙調五供養，玉交校聯套的，末綴本調金絡索二曲。雙紅記「盜絹」山坡羊與仙呂皂角兒聯套。祝髮記「祝髮」山坡羊亦與仙呂二犯傍粧台聯套，但末綴中呂撲燈蛾二曲。許之衡「曲律易知」卷下有幾句話說得很好：「山坡羊屬悲哀之曲，然或先悲而後喜者，則接仙呂或仙呂入雙調均可，視其情節而定之。」看羊以至凍餓，這是悲，但吃了仙人的賜與，便能不餓，這便是喜了；白娘娘怪許仙負心，不該讓法海欺負她，這是悲，但見面以後，又生憐念，這便是喜了；賣油生活固是悲，但乍見花魁，好像增加了新的生命力，這又是喜了；紅綃在閨中自怨自歎，等待情人不來，這是悲，但被崑崙負去與崔生相會，這又是喜了。祝髮不盡合此說，置之不論。</p>
<p>山坡羊與他調相聯的：藏舟聯黃鍾降黃龍與黃龍滾，驚夢聯越調山桃紅與綿搭絮，花神唱黃鍾，只能常作配角的插曲看。荆釵記哭鞋聯套最亂，次序是：仙呂入雙調川撥棹二曲，羽調勝如花一曲和越調憶虎序二曲。琵琶記喫糠則聯雙調孝順兒四曲和正宮雁過沙三曲。好像第一支總還是離不了仙呂入雙調或雙調似的。</p>
<p>（四）山坡羊每爲兩支相連，很少單獨用一支的。</p>
<p>山坡羊連用兩支的是：喫糠，看羊，盜綃，哭鞋，養馬，藏舟，斷橋，問病八齣，單用一支的僅祝髮，驚夢，賣油三齣。</p>
<h3>家</h3>
<p>— 唐遐齡</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>我兩年多沒有回家了，雖然離家只有二三百里路。但我沒有一天忘記過家。</p>
<p>白髮衰親：明年便七十歲了。我很久沒有瞻仰慈容，不知老人爲念遊子而朝夕倚閭，健康上又衰減幾分？這是我首先不能自己於懷的。</p>
<p>父親的墓木已拱了，我也應該回去進兩盂麥飯，燒幾張紙錢。一個人身後子女，除此還有什麼追遠的意思表現呢？</p>
<p>妻雖是個醜女子，但我們結婚十二年來，畢竟伉儷情篤。允其是那一雙小兒女，牽母佯啼，問我何日歸去？</p>
<p>因爲有了這些牽掛，所以我每天都打算着回家一次。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>哥哥上月裏來了一封信。</p>
<p>這封信在我心裘：如同尖刀刻下的一條血痕，現在每一憶起，還要使我痛哭失聲。</p>
<p>信裏而有一段是這樣寫的：</p>
<p>——你兩年多沒有回來了，家裘人都很想念你，尤其是母親，身體一天一天的衰弱下來，時常想起你的時候：便老淚奪眶而出。母親恐怕……我不忍心說：總而言之，你快回來看一趟吧！你的那兩個孩子，的確可愛！他們有時把小臉兒仰着：牽其母的衣襟問道：媽！爸爸什麼時候回來呀？表情是多麼天眞，誠懇，渴望着解答——</p>
<p>當時我心裏一酸！熱淚便從眼眶中滾出。在這個當兒：我似乎看見了母親扶着手杖，瘦弱無力的坐在椅子上面，從她的那副憂鬱蒼白的臉上看來，我感覺母親更衰老了。她老人家也不言語，只是眼含着一包慈淚，妻在旁邊做針綫，也低下頭去，熱淚更像珍珠一般，一連串的落下。兩個孩子看見大人那樣：呆了一忽，最後也就莫明其妙的張開小嘴，陪着哇的一聲哭了出來。一問屋裏：充滿着悲哀的空氣，悽切的情調，一發使我傷心無旣！</p>
<p>我伏在桌上：不知道哭了好久。</p>
<p>咕　一聲午炮，才算把我從悲哀的包圍圈裏解放出來當時我緊握着拳頭，決心的請假回去。</p>
<p>沒有想到，我又遲延至今，還未北上。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>大前年我回家住了幾天，滋味眞是十分難受！</p>
<p>家鄉不大平安。</p>
<p>苛捐黃汎，逼得遍地都是强盜，殺人搶刧，簡直一夕數驚。我家裏如今窮了，到不怕土匪來搶，可是我曾經在家鄕做過兩年行政工作，開罪梁山好漢，恐怕也是在所難免。看他們那種慘酷手段，實在叫我提心吊胆，夜不安枕。</p>
<p>同時兩袖清風回去，穿着破舊的粗布衣裳，雖然家裏人不像蘇季子的父母妻嫂那般勢利眼，可是自家看看自家的寒酸樣兒，總覺得有一點難以爲情。</p>
<p>尤其那些鄕下老，最愛的是錢；他們聽說我回來了，都到我家來看看我。幾旬粗俗的寒暄以後：他們便開始問我了：「一個月有多少薪餉？這一次剩多少錢帶回來？」好像人生就是爲了錢這一件大事。我是空囊而歸，眞叫他們問得不好意思，我心裏立刻浮起一種討厭和卑視的感情。但也只好淡笑一下算了。</p>
<p>母親明白我的苦衷，便從旁說道：</p>
<p>—錢！一個月到有幾千，但他不像我們家裏過日子，可以省吃儉用。他外邊有許多年靑朋友，應酬用錢很厲害，我們家翻正是窮了，橫財不富命苦人，我不想叫他亂弄錢，因爲刮地皮的人，子孫終究不昌啊！他規規矩矩的幾個死餉，那裏會有錢剩呢？他這次回去的盤川，恐怕還要家裏凑咧——</p>
<p>的確，家裏任何人，都不希望我弄錢，雖然窮了。</p>
<p>這樣的家庭：也眞給予貧病歸來的遊子不少精神上的安慰！</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>自家沒有錢帶回去，家裏反來因爲我回去的關係，增加了一些負擔，家裏若果是富有，倒也無所謂。</p>
<p>一些親朋隣家，都來看我，從早起到晚上深夜，屋裏總是不斷客人。到了吃飯時候：當然要留人家一頓便餐，鄕裏雖是沒有好東西吃，但幾樣熟菜，半斤燒酒和一些饅頭，無論怎樣是不能再儉省的。這些消耗和我回來一批旅費，家裏又買了兩擔多食糧</p>
<p>喝燒酒，睡眠時間不充分，使我委頓得力竭聲嘶，無法支持下去。</p>
<p>晚上到半夜纔能睡，鷄嗚狗叫一聲，便又慌得爬了起來聽着。早上正在好睡的時候：妻又到房裏來喊我，她說外面又來客了。雖然心裏有些兒煩！但覺得人家來的是美意，又只好起來揉揉眼睛出去。中午也沒有空暇午睡片時。我會吃酒，大家都是知道，客人到家，又不能不殷勤招待，陪着喝個盡歡。猜三道五，接連幾天喝個不息，未免過量一點。所以我到家第四天，眼睛便開始紅腫，嗓子也同時沙啞了。</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>八年黃災，家鄕苦得無法形容！</p>
<p>過去許多隣家，現在大部份都逃荒走了。在朔風凜冽中，一些破矮的茅屋裏面：鑚出來幾個衣服襤褸的鵠面鳩形的大人和小孩，手裏拿着小筐繩子，瑟縮的到崗上挖菜柴。樣子可憐得很！但還要在飢寒綫上掙扎。</p>
<p>鄕村到了這樣慘境，貪官汚吏們還是要刮喲！</p>
<p>保辦公處招待費，一個月也要兩三萬元，衣冠禽獸們，吃喝着小民最後一滴血。</p>
<p>繳五十市斤公糧，要預先準備老秤八十斤，他們秤像現代刊物一樣，好出特大號。</p>
<p>也不知道國家要多少壯丁，他們每人一年都要攤上幾回。但也便宜，只要你肯送上兩文，馬上便安然無事。他們要謀一家老小生活，所以在送禮方面，也就惟力是視了。</p>
<p>一家新買了幾升黃豆，預備和菜煮吃，然而鄕丁大人光臨，又把他弄走，據說是軍隊要馬料</p>
<p>另外他們闊派，中飽，簡直是無所不爲，聽見了以後令人生氣。但我又沒有財力與時間，出來拔刀相助，替我們同胞吿狀伸寃，打個不平。其實：他們都是上下相通，彼此勾結，蹤然我出來鬧他一下，也決沒有半點用處。除非我是劍仙俠客，可以飛刀殺人。</p>
<p>我是個小胆鬼，窮公務員，好安靜，心腸軟，却又有幾分傻氣。像這樣危險，拜金，酬應頻繁，滿目瘡痍，陰霾黑暗社會，我怎麼能敢回去呢？</p>
<p>（六）</p>
<p>家庭充滿着愛，溫馨，使人不覺的便會陶醉，會忘記了社會上所有的憎恨，仇視，和一切罪惡。</p>
<p>在故鄕，社會露出了黑暗的一面。小百姓在飢寒錢上掙扎，呻吟，顚沛流離。貪官汚吏們吸着人血，吃着同胞的骨和肉。吃喝飽了，他們發出來一個得意的獰笑。</p>
<p>回家滋味：像吃一顆甘草，先是甜，可是甜中又帶一些苦。</p>
<p>但我還是想要回家。</p>
<p>我想回到慈母的懷抱中：讓她老人家慈祥的手撫摸着我，撫摸着我的周身，把我沈浸在慈和愛匯成的大海裏；使我的身心能够復蘇。</p>
<p>到父親墓上，我想儘情的痛哭一塲！但不是單爲自己。</p>
<p>領着兩個孩子：我想在母親前學老萊子綵衣娛親，母親看見了，一定會笑出聲來，也許把我攬在懷裏，喊一聲乖兒。</p>
<p>妻將更要笑開櫻口。</p>
<p>家裏多麼快樂呀！我要趕快的回去啊！</p>
<p>然而，故鄕的許多可怕的陰影，又驀然間襲上心頭。</p>
<h3>女兵</h3>
<p>— 刃鋒刻</p>
<h3>爬山和舖路</h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>小時候聽見一位頭髮花白的老先生這樣說：「人生是一座荒山，漫長無際的歲月，就是那山上紊亂崎嶇的石級。年輕的時候我在這座荒山上喘息流汗，憧憬着山頂的奇景鮮花，幻想着美麗的白雲藍天，拚命地爬呀爬呀，不顧脚下的銳石荆棘、忘却了兩旁的懸崖深谷，只一心地爬上老，爬上去，好容易我到達了山頂。可是呀，當我到達山頂一看，什麼都沒有，而我是正在向着下山的去路了！」</p>
<p>人生眞的是這樣空幻碼？</p>
<p>許多年來，我確曾因着那位先生的話而惶惑疑慮；無論在深夜滴滴的細雨中，或是在淸晨微白的曙色裏，我總不忘記：我是在爬山！我不怕喘息流汗，也不怕銳石荆棘和懸崖絕壁；只是我怕，當我苦苦地爬到山頂的時候，眞的什麼都沒有，而我是正在向着下山的去路了！—那時候我將何等悲哀！</p>
<p>很僥倖，我忽然得到了一個解答：</p>
<p>是一個可愛的年輕朋友，有一次用她纖纖的小手在我的紀念册上繪了一幅畫，畫中有一個頭戴草帽的壯夫，在一塊荒凉的野地上舖着一條長長的路，他一手揑着鐵鏟，剷除前面的石塊磚層；另一手捧着鮮花的種子，一路地撒過去。於是在他撤過的地方，美麗的薔薇和馨香的玫瑰開放了，五色的蝴蝶在花前翩舞，活潑的小鳥在天空高飛……</p>
<p>朋友沒有給那幅畫題上什麼字，但這個深刻的啓示，已經够了！——</p>
<p>我不是在爬山，我是在舖路！</p>
<p>上帝沒有給任何人預備一個現成的美麗的山頂；上帝只給任何人一把鐵鏟，一包花種，，叫他們自己去創造，自己去舖築一條香花瀰漫的大路！</p>

<p>從郊外看北平，在雲層籠罩之下，在隆隆砲聲，響徹四野，倏然靜止的沉寂之下，這座古城，肅靜得好像一座千年的墟墓。您要是替牠想到當日龍讓虎步風橋陣馬的一番旺盛情景，也許免不了要替牠感覺惆悵。</p>
<p>從破曉到日落，到深夜，北平的人，抱着緊張的情緒，一面招架着一度一度排打過來的高潮，一面私下彼此打聽着「情形究竟怎麼樣哪？」同時還要抓住那維持一日三餐的活計，往下幹着；直到拾掇傢伙，關門下閂，打着呵欠，耽着一點心事，爬上床舖或炕舖。</p>
<p>城中某一部分人，一部分的特殊「選民」，我們可以隨意引用「醉生夢死」或「紙醉金迷」來描寫他們；單單是這般迷醉或夢死的人們，不知是失去了性靈，還是留戀着這已經沒落了的最後一絲之故都繁華，苦苦地支持着這每天一度，最後一次高潮的尾聲——電影院的『完』，園子的『明日請早』，八大胡同邊緣上韓安潭，可能聽得見那麼過尖了嗓子，喊着的最後一聲『見客—』，或是『明日見，您哪』。</p>
<p>這一切都過去了，偌大的一座城，才可以說表面的停止活動了。</p>
<p>我說「表面」，爲的還有一個「裏面」。在這「裏面」裏，至少還有兩股勢力，這時候還在朝着高潮的頂點，努力的活躍着：一股勢力很興頭的在討論，怎樣繼　　大　　　　着的大屠殺，「掃蕩」，「全減」。一股却是很沉着的在躊劃怎樣挽回這人類的浩刧。</p>
<p>就在這個時候，您要是站在祟文門的敵樓上，就可瞧見一個中等個子，穿着不大整齊的西服，拖着沉重的步子，但很機警的，從東交民巷穿了出來。他似乎很疲倦，因爲他從南郊來，蜿蜒地穿過了幾重零碎的火錢，至少經過了三次風險，還有相當多的麻煩。</p>
<p>您要是跟在他後面，可以看見這個踽踽凉凉的影子，走完了東交民巷，上了崇文門街大道，略略駐了駐足，四下張望了一下，就向東單牌樓走去</p>
<p>這時，他忽然覺得步子輕鬆了，腿上也帶了勁；因爲北平的路燈，雖說昏沉沉地，他却依稀看得出一箭不到的路東，矗立着一座六層的建築。這是他此行的目的地。大厦的每層，還留下一兩盞較弱的燈火，點綴着北平的一綫生機。</p>
<p>到了這座高樓的對街，他停了步。儘他的目力瞧去，街的兩頭，並看不見半個人影。認爲悄形適宜，他這　抬起一隻手來，好像漫不經心似的，把頭髮搔扒了幾下，又將衣領整了一整，於是提起輕快的步履，很敏捷地跨過街去，逕直走進那還半捲着的大門。</p>

<h3>致榮德生先生</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>德生先生：</p>
<p>對於閣下的飽受驚險，我們非常同情；而能安危出難，確是件値得欣慰的事！</p>
<p>閣下出險了，匪徒伏法了，軍警當局的努力偵防，凡是讀了警備司令部的全部經過報吿的人，不由不頌讚敬佩從事緝辦此案的工作人員的勤勇敏捷以及不辭勞瘁的精神，這是閣下的幸運，是市民安全的保障，也更是負責治安者的光榮！</p>
<p>事情雖已結束，據說還有點小首尾尚待料理，這首尾就是閣下的家屬付與綁匪的贖款，經第三方面軍及警察局警備司令部稽查處先後抄獲的美金二十四萬餘元，據說，此項賊款依法應發還被擄人領回，並且已由警備部通知閣下於今日前往該部軍法處具領。</p>
<p>像這樣的情形，是否「依法」須發還，自有法學家來解答，不過為閣下着想，恐怕不一定要領回此款的。道理無他，（一）當初閣下家屬拿出此款時，目的在脫閣下於險，決不打算收回的，這正如中國的一句老話，所謂求其「財去人安樂」而已；（二）退一步想，假使綁匪們在未破案之前而全部花用了，無從追回，那不也是件極大可能的事嗎？</p>
<p>因此，我們願意向閣下建議，將這筆款子設立一個「德生助學金」，來資助那些無錢讀書的莘莘學子，這樣不僅那些受惠的學子終身感動，國家社會也同樣蒙受其利。</p>
<p>近來學校荒，學費貴的嚴重情形，閣下不致於不知道；尊師運動，敎育貸金，叔蘋公獎學金，以及其他很多很多的熱心人士的奔走呼號，閣下也不致於不知道。美金廿四萬餘元，以目前法幣折合華三三五〇計算，約為七億八千四百餘萬元，這不是一個小數目，倘使閣下贊同此事，立即實行，它所產生的效果，那是無法估計的。</p>
<p>我們敬佩閣下從事實業的功績，我們更相信閣下明白了這些道理後，定有救濟今日上海失學靑年的決心，因之，我們願意向閣下呼籲和建議！</p>
<p>心理衛生</p>
<h3>怎樣應付苦悶　壓制乎？發洩乎？</h3>
<p>— 桂庭</p>
<p>「萬事須執其中，過度則受其害！」—心理健康的座右銘。</p>
<p>有些人神經非常鎭靜，似乎雖泰山崩圯於前，亦無動乎中者。但有些人則完全相反，稍受刺激，則坐立不安，倉惶不知所措。實則從生理心理上看來，這兩種人可能是同樣神經緊張的。</p>
<p>在我們目前所處的環境下，神經上的刺激是絕對不能避免的。我們的問題就是：怎樣能够正當發洩這些神經的力量，以免過分緊張。</p>
<p>發洩的方法</p>
<p>發洩神經的力量以免過分緊張的方式大致有四種：（一）以肌肉運動的方式來冲淡神經的緊張，於是就做出許多小動作來，如嚼口香糖，搖脚，或者演手勢等，（二）由口部以聲音的方式來發洩神經的力量如唱歌，吹噓，或談笑等動作；（三）以身體組織的消耗來維持外表的鎭靜，結果使內藏的正常運動遭受意外的障碍。所以，許多人為了社會的地位不能任意發洩他們的情感者如商塲的老闆，敎授，律師等，通常是最容易患着消化器和心臟的毛病的；（四）另外一種是觀念運動的方式。這種人總是喜歡整天在那裏幻想，從空山樓閣裏硏究一些解決困難的辦法；有時在自己腦筋裏轉念頭如何應付對己侮辱的人。這也是屬於這一類發洩神經緊張的方式。</p>
<p>肌肉的運動</p>
<p>在此四類的方式裏，肌肉的運動是最有效騐的。我們平常也曾注意到，勞動人的神經總是不會像職業工人和寫字間職員那麼緊張。比方，搥石塊的工人總是不會患失眠病的。至於觀念運動呢，有時也許能够適應環境而獲有裨益。但其害却有兩端：（一）因為這樣並不需要消耗許多生理上的精力，所以仍然未能减少過分的緊張，（二）幻想得太多，有時會達到不能分辨夢幻與唯實的地步。以口部用聲音的方式來减輕神經緊張的效果則在乎上述兩者之間，而這是袪除胸中苦悶的最簡便的辦法。以身體組織的消耗來維持外表的鎭靜是最要不得的辦法，因為神經的緊張旣無處發洩，則結果祗能向內發展，對比較衰弱的臟腑進攻，於是百病　生，如心臟病，消化不良，頭痛等。</p>
<p>勿過分禁壓</p>
<p>我們目前生活上最大的錯誤是把天然賦予我們發洩神經緊張的出路都關閉起來，並且從不設法找尋另外的出路。下面的建議對於患着神經緊張的人們或許有所裨助。第一，我們可以變動生活的方式來减輕神經緊張。尤其是劇烈的運動至為有效。第二我們有時也不能不對於發洩神經緊張的方式有所選擇，使其在特殊的情形下發揮最大的效果。譬如你一下不留意倒翻了墨水瓶，弄得四處都齷齪不堪。當時你可以咀　一番，或者忙着用吸水紙把它弄乾淨，來發洩你精神上所受的刺激，那麼，不用說，後面的方式是較為適宜的。這在心理學上是呌做「特殊的適應」。第三，我們有時也可以施用與當前環境無關的補充動作來發洩精神的緊張。下面一例可以為證。兩班大學生參加考試一班是命令着靜坐應考，不許妄動；而加一班則准其自由行動或作任何聲響。於是，後一班的學生在考試時口嚼香口糖，手舞足蹈，做着各式各樣的動作。而其他一班的學生就緊張到歇斯的利來起來。所以，我們精神一受刺激之後，最好是走到花園裏運動一番，到廚房裏去烤餅，或者甚至於咬指甲，亂敲鋼琴。</p>
<p>反覆的嘗試</p>
<p>這樣總比合起掌來，強作歡容，以誇示自制能力，有益得多了。第四，假使你試過上述的方法而未奏效時，你可以施用「反覆嘗試」的方式。這又是心理學上的一個名詞，其原理是：「如果你起首就失敗了的話，你應該再嘗試一次或者無數次」。第五，心理健康上最重要的座右銘就是：「萬事須執其中過度則受其害」。例如我們淸晨早起，吃過一頓豐美大餐，或者運動一番之後，就埋首於解決算數問題。初時，精神興奮，銳敏與迅度逐漸增加。但是到了某種程度，腦筋便會遲鈍起來，到後來甚至於完全崩潰了。所以，我們在「執其中」之時，亦即在並不太緊張之時，是做工作最有效最容易的時候。</p>

<p>— 流亡</p>
<p>公博：哎喲！老兄太失約了，等得我好苦。</p>
<p>民誼：對不起，我那賢妻，替我什麼上訴再審……唉……</p>
<p>公博：××兄怎麼還沒來？</p>
<p>民誼：他眞開心，在重慶天天逛舞廳呢？</p>
<p>公博：（嘆氣）唉諒天下之大漢奸，唯君與公博耳。</p>
<h3>低調</h3>
<p>— 三公</p>
<p>海軍士兵兇殺電車售票員一事，可作「士氣旺盛」一例看。</p>
<p>外匯調整時吳市長曾力言決不致影響日用必需品之售價，八月底市府公布之生活指數，果與七月份不相上下，方知市長之不我欺也。</p>
<p>記得預言家曾經這樣說過：「今年無夏季」。他的預言却是中了，你看今年最熱的天氣不是不在夏季而在秋季麼？</p>
<p>「夫子溫良恭儉讓，以得之，」這句格言假使用在軋電車及公共汽車的時候，適足成為「夫子溫良恭儉讓以失之。」</p>

<h3>印度要人：尼赫魯</h3>
<p>— 溪枝</p>
<p>英國終於在西姆拉會議中允許印度獨立了。現在印度國民大會主席尼赫魯，已經接受了英國魏菲爾總督的邀請，出任組織印度獨立過渡時的政府，使印度走向眞正自由平等的路上去。這裡介紹一些關於尼赫魯的事：</p>
<p>遠在十八世紀的時候，他的祖先由那高原地帶遷移到沃野千里的平原地帶來。這位祖先名呌拉吉，高爾，是一位有聲望的波斯文和梵文學者，甚為當時的蒙哥爾王朝的皇帝所器重，移居皇城德里，還得到一份封地，包括一條運河上的住宅。所從「尼赫魯」（意為運河）一字，便和這位祖先的名字，連在一起，成為他的姓名的一部分。後來「高爾」一字漸漸取消，我們便單呌「尼赫魯」了。</p>
<p>這族人幾經盛衰，結果那份封地用盡，後來又受了一八五七年印度民族革命運動的影響，失掉了所有的一切，他的祖父和兩位伯父，便只好加入難民羣，流亡到亞格刺城。在這個時候，印度便被英國以暴政侵佔統治，以迄於今。</p>
<p>他父親在後半世的時候，憤恨英國暴政統治印度，斷然拋棄了一切，變成印度民族的鬥士，為印度民族解放而奮鬥，總因辛勞過甚，死於一九三一年。</p>
<p>他從幼年時，常受堂哥的思想薰陶，充滿了對外族統治的憤恨，同時又受家庭敎師布魯克司（美國人）的影響，一九〇五年於十六歲時到英國入哈洛學校求學；繼後轉入劍橋大學硏究，他喜歡文學，書籍愛好王爾德（十九世紀末英國唯美文學家）的作品。同時，因為要做當時在美國獄中的印度革命家的辯護，所以也正經讀過法律。</p>
<p>他於一九一二年二十三歲時回國，隨即參加國民運動，為印度回敎的領袖，一九二一年不合作運動發生的時候，即熱烈贊助這項運動，終致初次被捕入獄，迄今已有七次之多，他在監獄內，待遇比較寬大，因為許可他讀書和寫文章，反而成了硏究政治經濟的好機會，把他變成了一個社會主義的思想者，經過了十多年的奮鬥，他在印度的地位，日漸崇高，全印度人民，對他的敬愛，僅次於甘地，他不但是甘地的忠實信徒，同時也是甘地惟一的繼任人。他的夫人茄夢娜，是一位女中之傑，正為跟隨她丈夫奔走革命而入獄，因此身體衰弱，病死於一九三六年，他有一個女兒，呌做苗蒂娜，是留美國的學生。</p>
<p>他為了促進中印兩國的親善。在我國抗戰方甜的時候，正經來中國觀光過一次，回國以後，便積極鼓勵國內的大學，添設中國文一科。這就表現了中國給了他深刻的影響，而他對我們中國寄着莫大的希望。</p>
<p>他有身高五尺十寸英尺的軀幹，非常英俊，他很歡喜運動和游泳，愛好著作，山水。小孩的時候，也喜歡吃肉，後因受甘地的勸吿，一九二〇年以來，就成為素食主義者了。煙草時不釋手，酒於出國的時候，或許也稍許飲一些。</p>
<p>他平常總是帶着一個白色甘地帽，在白色帽子的下面，露出了灰白色的頭髪，這可想見他為印度奮鬥的勞悴了。他的面孔相當的白，並不像我們平常在上海所見的印度人一樣。他穿着白色印度式的腰衣，外面加一件背心，正和其他印度甘地信徒一樣，脚下穿的是草屨，着了這個裝束，你決不會想到他是一個貴族出身的人。</p>

<h3>The Communist Party Still Insists on Preconditions; Five-Person Talks Await Commencement; Zhou Enlai Visited Special Envoy Marshall Yesterday for Extensive Discussions</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 4th Dispatch] The prelude to the informal five-person group meeting has already shown that it will encounter immense difficulties. The point of divergence stems from the Communist Party's repeated insistence on resolving two preconditions. The government believes that the purpose of convening this meeting, as suggested by Ambassador Stuart and Special Envoy Marshall, is solely to resolve the issue of reorganizing the National Government Committee and does not involve any other matters. This is because the reorganization of the National Government Committee is the crux of all other issues. Moreover, a ceasefire cannot be effectively achieved on the basis of the so-called unconditional ceasefire alone to achieve a permanent ceasefire. The foundation still lies in the reorganization and unification of the armed forces. If a satisfactory agreement can be reached on this point and implemented accordingly, then the fundamental conditions for a ceasefire will be met, and the war will stop by itself, even without being called to a halt. On the 4th, all parties were watching Zhou Enlai's actions, hoping that he could visit Stuart and Marshall promptly and that progress could be made so that this meeting could commence. However, Zhou only visited Special Envoy Marshall at 4:30 PM and left at 7:30 PM. According to a spokesperson for the Communist Party delegation, they can only provide eight characters at present, which means Mr. Zhou believes that "the situation is serious and the future is bleak." When reporters asked if he would visit Ambassador Stuart again for pre-meeting discussions, they were told that it had not yet been decided. However, they stated that if these two preconditions are not decided before the meeting, the meeting cannot be held. They also said that what they consider most important are the ceasefire and military matters, and they are not interested in the "eight, four, four, four" quota for members of the National Government Committee. The talks with Special Envoy Marshall on the 4th were mainly about the ceasefire issue. The Communist Party's attitude towards the small group meeting will be clarified in the coming days.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 4th Dispatch] Ambassador Stuart and Special Envoy Marshall were still waiting to meet with Zhou Enlai with a positive attitude on the 4th. There were no activities from any parties in the morning. At 12:30 PM, Special Envoy Marshall visited President Song at Beijige, where they had a long conversation and had lunch together. Zhou Enlai only arrived at the guesthouse to meet at 4:30 PM. Ambassador Stuart first met with Minister Yu Dawei around 4:00 PM, reportedly a casual conversation covering a wide range of topics, including British and American customs and sentiments. Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng arrived at 5:00 PM and left at 6:15 PM. According to Wu and Zhang, their only current goal is to await the day when the small group meeting can be convened. Regarding the Communist Party's so-called preconditions, since they were not raised beforehand, they have no opinion to express. They only hope for a satisfactory outcome. Wu and Zhang were very calm in their attitude.</p>
<p>Wu and Zhang Visited Ambassador Stuart Again Yesterday, Making Extremely Constructive Representations</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th Dispatch] Government representatives Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng of the non-official five-person group meeting, visited Ambassador Stuart again at his residence at 5:00 PM on the 4th, for a long talk that lasted an hour and a half. Minister Yu Dawei happened to visit the Ambassador before Wu and Zhang arrived, so he also participated in the conversation, as did Fu Jingbo. After Wu and others left, the Ambassador met with the Central News Agency reporter alone. The Ambassador said: "We are all waiting for Mr. Zhou Enlai. Until Mr. Zhou informs us that he is ready to participate, there is nothing to do." Stuart continued: "Government representatives are prepared to participate in the talks." When asked about his impressions after meeting with government representatives twice, he said: "They show a very constructive and helpful attitude." He then said: "Minister Zhang and I are new to our positions, but Secretary-General Wu is an old friend. I met Mr. Wu when he was the mayor of Shanghai, and I visited him every time I went to Shanghai. Later, we met several times in Hong Kong and Chongqing." The Ambassador continued: "Yesterday, I met with Marshal Marshall and talked with the American senators who visited Beijing. Their visit to China is unrelated to the liquidation of American military property." The conversation lasted for twenty minutes. The Ambassador was very happy and showed that he still had hope for the talks. The Ambassador finally shook hands with the reporter and said: "I am invited to dinner by the British Ambassador tonight. He told me not to wear a tie, just a jacket, to attend this most informal dinner, which is what I am most happy to attend." The Ambassador went to the British Ambassador's dinner at eight o'clock. General Wyatt was also present. Furthermore, Zhou Enlai has not yet met with Ambassador Stuart this evening.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 4th Dispatch] On the 4th, a spokesperson for the Communist Party delegation stated that the Communist Party has lodged a serious protest with Marshal Marshall and Ambassador Stuart regarding the purchase of surplus American materials agreement signed between the US and the government but has not received a response.</p>
<p>[Our Taixian Office, 4th Dispatch] According to military sources here this afternoon, the battle on the outskirts of Hai'an is currently proceeding fiercely.</p>
<p>[Our Taixian Office, 4th Dispatch] Taixing News: American senators were hosted at a banquet by Deputy Foreign Minister Gan Naiguang in Beijing. Martin is on the right, and the person in the front row on the left in the diagram is Mr. Gan.

(2) The situation in Rugao Hai'an is stable.</p>
<p>[Our Jiangdu Office, 3rd Dispatch] After the focus of the war in northern Jiangsu shifted to the right wing, the Communist army on the Yunhe River on the left wing has gradually moved eastward in batches. In addition to strengthening fortifications, the Communist army left behind is also seizing rice and forcibly collecting grain for transportation north.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 4th Dispatch] 150,000 Communist troops from Northeast China, including 5,000 Koreans armed with Japanese weapons, are heading to northern Jiangsu to reinforce.</p>
<h3>Curfew in Chengjing Area Extended by Two Hours</h3>
<p>[Our Jiangyin Office, 4th Dispatch] After the establishment of the Chengjing Area Command, Commander Guo Yongbiao set up defensive works in important areas inside and outside the city in order to strengthen the defense of the port. The curfew has been extended by two hours starting from the 4th. Also, according to reports, the situation on the outskirts of Jingjiang is slightly tense. Fires and killings have only occurred in Gushan Town, Guojiadai, and other places. The security of Jingcheng is solid and quiet as usual.</p>
<h3>The Communist Army Recruits Lake Bandits, Planning Activities in Southern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Office, 4th Dispatch] Recently, Su Yu, the political commissar of the New Fourth Army of the Chinese Communist Party, personally went to Taihu Lake and recruited more than 5,000 lake bandits led by Japanese Communist Wu Zhi and bandit leaders Yang Yanbin and Gu Fuxing into the Taihu Column of the New Fourth Army. Yang Yanbin was appointed as the commander of the column, and Gu Fuxing was appointed as the political commissar and concurrently the head of Taihu County. The column includes three detachments, with Jin Buqing as the commander of the first detachment, Fan Shiping as the commander of the second detachment, and Zhou Hequn as the commander of the third detachment. They are preparing to conduct large-scale activities in southern Jiangsu.</p>
<h3>Airlift of Food and Medicine to Support Datong Garrison</h3>
<p>Northeast National Army Enters Halahai</p>
<p>[Our Guling Office, 4th Dispatch] The morale of the National Army in Datong is extremely high, but there are difficulties in obtaining food and medicine. The authorities have taken effective measures to provide supplies by airlift. The Beiping Pacification Headquarters has also sent telegrams to the officers and soldiers defending the city to encourage them.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Office, 4th Dispatch] The National Army has entered Halahai, a station on the Changchun-Bai Chengzi railway, located northwest of Changchun, more than 170 li away.</p>
<h3>The Tianjin Section of the Beining Railway is Repeatedly Sabotaged by the Communist Army</h3>
<p>[Our Tianjin Office, 4th Dispatch] The Tianjin-Yuyu section of the Beining Line has been repeatedly sabotaged recently. The National Army authorities are strengthening their attention to this situation.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Office, 3rd Dispatch] At 211 kilometers between Chadian and Hangu on the Beining Road, a mine was again buried and destroyed by the Communist Army on the morning of the 3rd. An armored vehicle derailed there at 4:00 AM. When workers were repairing it, it triggered a mine explosion, seriously injuring five people and slightly injuring four people. Five unexploded landmines were later dug up. It was repaired at 1:35 PM. Between Tangshan and Kaiping, the Communist Army secretly removed track nails on the 3rd morning. Five mixed passenger cars derailed there at 3:00 AM and were only repaired at 3:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Carpenters From All Over Chahar Province Are Recruited Empty by the Communist Army</h3>
<p>Gathering at Juyongguan to Build Fortifications</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 4th Dispatch] It is reported that the Communist Army has gathered carpenters from all over Chahar Province in the Juyongguan area to build fortifications.</p>
<h3>Accepting Director Xue Yue's Advice, Hao Pengju Led His Troops to Revolt; Du Shu, Who Was Captured While Defending Dongming, Escaped and Returned</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 3rd Dispatch] Hao Pengju, the former commander of the Sixth Route Army, was incited by the Communist Party and moved north with his troops. After claiming to be the "Commander-in-Chief of the Democratic Allied Army," he eventually felt uneasy due to incompatible temperaments and suspicion and discrimination from the Communist Army. The reporter recently entered the city with the head of Suqian County. According to the surrendered officers and soldiers of the 3478th and other divisions of the New Fourth Army, Hao Pengju has accepted Director Xue Yue's advice, implemented a revolt with his troops, assumed a new position, and declared his support for the Central Government, obedience to Chairman Chiang, and commitment to peaceful unification, military reorganization, and national construction. He has been fighting against the Communist Army in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 4th Dispatch] Du Shu, the former commander of the 17th Detachment, who had defended Dongming for half a year, was captured by the Communist Army in Juancheng, western Shandong, after Dongming fell. He recently took advantage of an opportunity and led more than a thousand of his former troops to escape and return at the end of August. He arrived at An Yang Dongtianshi Village on the first day and has telegraphed the Pacification Office to report and await orders.</p>
<h3>The Communist Army in Chifeng is Preparing to Retreat; Most of Rehe Province is Recovered; The National Army Advancing in Eastern Hebei Enters Laoting</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 4th Dispatch] The claim that Chifeng has been recovered by the National Army has not yet been confirmed today, but the Communist Army guarding Chifeng is destroying the airfield and moving supplies on a large scale, which is the same as the signs of withdrawing from Chengde. The area is located in the center of Rehe, and occupying it can control northern Rehe and is the trading center for livestock fur of the Mongolians in northern Rehe and the trading center in the cold winter. At present, the counties recovered by the National Army in Rehe Province include Fuxin, Chaoyang, Lingyuan, Jianping, Pingquan, Lingnan, Ningcheng, Chifeng (although not confirmed, the government has sent a county magistrate there), Chengde, Luanping, and other ten counties, accounting for half of the province's twenty-one counties, but its main parts have all fallen into the hands of the government. Once the Pingcheng Road is opened, the military and political significance of Rehe should not be underestimated. Another report states that the National Army in Longhua has reached 20 kilometers northwest of Longhua, and another unit is advancing towards Fengning. Zheng Dongguo hinted to reporters that the Communist Army in Rehe offered little resistance because they concentrated their forces on capturing Datong, so recovering Weichang Chifeng should not be difficult. Although the distance from Gubeikou to Chengde is close, the mountains are heavy, and a part of the Communist Army is still concentrated in the mountains, so it may take some time for the National Army to advance.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 4th Dispatch] According to sources, the mopping-up operation in eastern Hebei started yesterday west of the Beining Railway. The National Army advancing southeast from Luanxian recovered Fencheng yesterday, and then recovered Laoting. It is expected that the plain area in the west of the Beining Line can be stabilized in ten days. The stabilization of the entire area of eastern Hebei will take about twenty days. Chen Jicheng, the deputy commander of the Eleventh War Zone, is now stationed in Tangshan. A certain military figure stationed in Tianjin will go to the front line tomorrow to inspect. Also, the claim that Gubeikou was recovered is not accurate, but the National Army going north has arrived at the first town north of Gubeikou yesterday. The war in that area is quite fierce. At the same time, the work of clearing the countryside is also being carried out in the Shijiazhuang area of central Hebei.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Office, 4th Dispatch] According to reports, Zheng Dongguo arrived at Shanhaiguan from Pingjin today and is currently in charge of the command of the National Army in that area.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Office, 4th Dispatch] General Zheng Dongguo flew from Shenyang to Beiping on the 2nd to meet with the military authorities in North China. At 12:30 noon on the 4th, he took a car through Tianjin and out of the pass.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Office, 4th Dispatch] When the reporter asked Commander Du Yuming about the war in Rehe, Du said that in order to no longer wait passively to be attacked, there was this advance. Our commander is Deputy Commander Zheng Dongguo. After two and a half days of effort, Chengde was officially recovered. Now, many new forces have arrived, and Chengde is becoming more peaceful. The National Army in Gubeikou will be able to join forces. The Jin-Cheng Road from Jinzhou to Chengde is now open to traffic to Pingquan. The road west of this point has been heavily damaged by the Communist Army and is now being repaired. According to Du's estimation, the Communist Army in Rehe still has 30,000 troops. The Communist Army in the far south had planned to cooperate with the war in Rehe and launch an offensive, but they were repelled.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, 3rd Dispatch] Since Shi Jue, the commander of the 13th Army, will take office as the commander of the Chengde Garrison, the security in the city has gradually recovered. However, the Communist Army destroyed a lot before retreating. The power and electrical equipment of the city were bombed and destroyed, resulting in dim lights and a dark world. The Jingu Road has made rapid progress since the repair. Lingyuan to Pingquan is about to be opened for military use. The repair between the west and Chengde is difficult because the rails and sleepers are extremely damaged.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 4th Dispatch] The Military Mediation Department reported today that the whereabouts of the executive group stationed in Chengde are unknown. The last telegram received from the group was on August 27th. According to government sources, the National Army in Rehe is advancing rapidly, and the Communist Army is retreating to Olun, 250 miles northwest of Chengde, but this information has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<h3>Tang Enbo's Speech Denies He Will Head Jiangsu</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 4th Dispatch] Tang Enbo, the commander of the capital garrison, hosted reporters on the 4th. I recognize that he will serve as the chairman of Jiangsu Province. He also said: Some bandits in Taihu Lake have been dispatched to suppress them, and the Jinghu line is very peaceful. There is no problem with the security of the capital.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 4th Dispatch] The 25-member group investigating the Anping incident held a meeting on the morning of the 4th. The government proposed to add two witnesses (one was a captured Communist soldier, and the other was a merchant whose car was intercepted by the Communist Army before the incident), but the Communist Party opposed it, so the meeting ended without results. It will continue tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 3rd Dispatch] The process of the 25-member group of the Military Mediation Department visiting the senior commanders of the three parties has been successfully completed.</p>
<h3>Zhangjiakou is Full of War Intent; Nie Rongzhen Admits That the National Army Entered Chengde; Regarding Datong, He Said That It is Still Under Siege</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 3rd Dispatch] Amid the smoke of war on the Great Wall line, Nie Rongzhen (commander of the Jinchaji Border Region), who commands the Communist Army on this line, met with four Chinese and foreign reporters accompanying the 25-member group in Zhangjiakou today. He said: For military necessity, the Communist Army withdrew from Chengde on the 26th after fighting. The war is currently expanding to eastern Hebei and western Liaoning. Talking about Datong at the other end of the Great Wall, he denied that the Communist Army had ever entered Datong, saying that it was still under siege. Associated Press reporter Parker asked if the Communist Army must capture Datong. Nie replied: Everything is easy to say if there is peace. Then he attacked Yan Xishan for using Japanese prisoners of war and Hu Zongnan's troops for entering southern Shanxi. When reporters asked when Datong could be captured, Nie replied that it was not under his command and that Chief of Staff He Long and Zhang Zongxun were currently in charge. In the question and answer session, he denied the news that Fu Zuoyi's troops had reached Sanchahe, saying that the Communist Army on the western section of the Ping Sui Line was ahead of Zhuozi Mountain to the east and that it was still very calm there. Foreign reporters asked if the National Army attacked Zhangjiakou, would the Communist Army follow Chengde and retreat automatically or resist resolutely. Nie replied that if the other party was determined to attack, they would be determined to resist. Associated Press reporter Matteson felt that the visit was too brief and expressed his willingness to come again in the short term. Nie said poetically, "This is autumn, I hope this is spring." The current Zhangjiakou is full of war atmosphere. Almost every street's bulletin board is calling for mobilization for self-defense. A government official told me that the streets are arresting recruits very fiercely every day. The working hours of the military factories have been extended to fourteen hours, and they do not rest on Sundays. The border region trade company is rushing to make three thousand boxes of biscuits to慰勞"frontline" fighters. The wives of the Chinese Communist Party cadres have all been evacuated to the countryside. Many strips of paper have been re-pasted on every high-rise building. Anti-aircraft trenches have been dug everywhere in the fields of the suburbs. Today, while the group was entering Zhangjiakou City from the airport, two planes were circling in the air for reconnaissance, and then flew north. The representatives of the three parties were so frightened that they jumped out of the car and ran into the autumn crops to take cover once.</p>
<h3>Government Personnel in Guling Will Leave the Mountain Successively</h3>
<p>[Our Guling Office, 4th Dispatch] Government personnel in Guling are currently packing their luggage and will be leaving the mountain successively before the 10th of this month. Wu Dingchang, the chief civil servant of the National Government, will return to Beijing before the 10th.</p>
<h3>Deng Yingchao in Shanghai Speaks to the Press</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Deng Yingchao, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, hosted the press in this city at her residence at No. 107 Masnan Road at 3:00 PM yesterday to attend the International Women's Congress in the United States. Three points were reported: (1) The International Women's Congress was initiated by the late President Roosevelt's wife, with the aim of bringing together women from all countries in the world to jointly study and discuss the cooperative ways that should be adopted to assist in the realization of the United Nations Charter. The conference is scheduled to be held in New York on October 13th. Deng has received an invitation from Mrs. Kartell, the chairman of the steering committee of the conference, and will go abroad after the passport procedures are completed. In order to fully provide the opinions of the Chinese women to the conference, six questions were raised based on the conference's preliminary agenda, and she is prepared to publicly solicit opinions from female compatriots from various countries. (2) The International Democratic Women's Federation was established in Paris last November with the aim of eliminating fascism. At that time, representatives from more than 40 countries including Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France attended, and a total of ten people from China planned to participate. However, due to transportation restrictions, they were unable to make the trip, and the Chinese embassy in France was entrusted to submit the agenda on their behalf. As a result, the conference elected official directors of the conference, and China occupied eight seats, and notified the CCP area that it could occupy three seats (two official and one alternate). After the general election of women in the CCP area, Deng Yingchao, Cai Chang, and Ding Ling (alternate) were elected. The conference has now decided to convene the Executive Committee in Moscow on October 15th. The conference will last for three days, and the main issues are to resolve the aftermath and food issues. Deng decided to give up because of the conflict between the two conferences. (3) I hope that Chinese women will put forward their opinions as much as possible and submit them to the conference for discussion.</p>
<h3>The Communist Army in the Suburbs of Nantong Recruits Laborers, Forcibly Conscripting 150,000 Strong Men, Expanding the Militia Organization and Transferring Them to the Front Line</h3>
<p>[Report from this Zhenjiang, 4th Dispatch] According to official sources, the Communist Army's rebellion in northern Jiangsu is unfulfilled and intends to conscript 150,000 strong men in the suburbs of Nantong. Conscription began on September 1st in Liuqiao, Qiantang, Lusi, and other places. In the name of holding a "turning over meeting," all the strong men who arrived were detained and escorted to another location to replenish the number of soldiers. It is said that nearly 40,000 strong men have been forcibly conscripted in Jinsha, Shigang, Xiting, Qiantang, Lusi, Liuqiao, and other areas in recent days, and they have all been imprisoned by the Communist Army in Shigang Town. Conscription is still continuing in various townships. In addition, the Communist Army in northern Jiangsu has recently expanded the militia organization, with the county as the regiment, the district as the battalion, and the township as the team. The township team leader is responsible for patrolling and checking, and is transferred to the front line when necessary. Each township is organized with a 1,000-member anti-special operations commando team to control all words and deeds of the people.</p>
<h3>Commander-in-Chief Chen Executed Reporters Yesterday, Summarizing Military Reforms, and the National Army's Reorganized Troops Have Exceeded 60 Percent</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 4th Dispatch] At 3:30 PM on the 4th, Commander-in-Chief Chen Cheng hosted Chinese and foreign reporters at Lishi Society, with more than a hundred people present. First, Chen made a brief report, which was divided into the following three points: (1) The reorganization of the Ministry of National Defense is gradually being completed. It is expected that all departments will be on the right track by the end of this month. (2) Regarding the military reorganization plan decided by the three-person group, the government is continuing to implement it. More than 60% have now been reorganized, and the rest will continue to be reorganized despite all difficulties. (3) The issue of surplus officers is being handled in the following three ways. First, those who are old and voluntarily retire have been allowed to retire. Second, those who still volunteer to be career officers are currently being trained to prepare them for incorporation into the army. Third, those who volunteer to change careers are currently undergoing career change education. After the report, reporters asked questions, and Commander-in-Chief Chen answered them one by one. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reorganization situation question: How many officers and soldiers have been reorganized? Answer: The original 59 armies have been reorganized into 59 divisions. It is hoped that the remaining 31 armies will be reorganized into 31 divisions, for a total of 90 divisions. Question: How will the surplus officers and soldiers be handled? Answer: Those who are surplus will retire.</p>
<p>Shanxi-Rehe war question: What is the situation in Datong? Director Li of the Ministry of National Defense answered on behalf of him: Mr. Zhou Enlai once guaranteed not to attack Datong, but since June 21, he has started attacking the outposts of the Datong regiment, and a total of nine counties have fallen, and he directly attacked Datong on August 3. As of today, Datong is still in the hands of the government army. Question: Is the National Army preparing to attack Zhangjiakou? Answer: Datong, Zhangjiakou, and Chengde have historically been regarded as a battlefield due to their topographical relations. If the Communist Army does not stop attacking Datong, the situation may expand to Zhangjiakou. Question: Is Yan'an also on the same battlefield as Datong in history? Answer: Yes. Question: What is the situation of the government army attacking Chifeng? Answer: There is no report of the occupation of Chifeng. I would like to make a brief report on the occupation of Chengde: The government's 13th Army has a unit stationed in Ningcheng north of Pingquan. When the Communist Army besieged Ningcheng, the army sent troops to relieve the siege. Then the front-line generals received a report from the representatives of the people of Chengde that Chengde was an empty city, and all Xiao Ke and He Long's troops had gone to attack Datong. The local people could not bear the harassment of the Communist Army and welcomed the National Army to enter. Therefore, they entered Chengde without bloodshed. In order to ensure Chengde, we had to occupy Longhua to its north and Luanping to its southeast.</p>
<p>Situation in Northern Jiangsu Question: What is the situation in Northern Jiangsu? Director Li of the Ministry of National Defense answered on behalf of him: At the beginning of July, Mr. Zhou Enlai suddenly protested to the government against the National Army's attack on Northern Jiangsu. The Communist Army forged the battle order of General Tang Enbo, using it as an excuse to launch a large-scale attack. The units participating in the attack included Su Yu and Tan Zhenlin's troops, with a total of about 16 regiments. They also falsely claimed that General Wang Tiehan was captured, and were eventually counterattacked by the government army and fled north. After the National Army recovered Rugao, Hai'an, and Libao, it did not pursue further in order to comply with the ceasefire agreement. However, the Communist Army reinforced and counterattacked again, successively capturing Dingyan and Linzi, and then besieging Hai'an. At present, the government has taken defensive measures to avoid further expansion of the situation. If the Communist Army continues to attack, exceeding the government army's limit of tolerance, the situation will inevitably expand.</p>
<p>National Army Equipment Question: How many American-equipped divisions does China have? Answer: Before the counter-offensive in the War of Resistance Against Japan, 39 divisions were planned, but after the victory, the American Lend-Lease Act was stopped, and the American equipment was also stopped being transported to China. Therefore, at present, only the six divisions originally in India are fully equipped, and the equipment level of the remaining 33 divisions is less than 70%.</p>

<h3>Zhou Enlai Tells Foreign Reporters That the General Situation and Future are Extremely Pessimistic; It is Said That the CCP Has No Minimal Contact with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, this city, 3rd Dispatch] Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, returned to Beijing from Shanghai on the afternoon of the third. Before leaving, he met with reporters from the Associated Press and issued a statement, saying that the overall situation in China has the danger of causing a complete split and expanding into a full-scale civil war, and that it is natural for the Communist Army to choose a favorable location to implement a counter-offensive. One of the main reasons for the civil war is that it has been supported by the US government. If the US stops this assistance and withdraws its troops from China, peace "can be achieved immediately." Zhou also answered reporters' questions, saying that the Soviet government has never assisted the Communist Party, the Chinese Communist Party is a political party, and has no direct relationship with the Soviet Union. Zhou said that he did not believe that the Chinese civil war could automatically cause a third world war. Zhou also said that although the joint statement of Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart has admitted that its mission has failed, the United States is still negotiating to sell its surplus materials to China. These surplus materials are valued at US$855 million, which is the largest amount in Chinese history. Such open assistance to one side of the war in China will invalidate the peace efforts of Ambassador Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, and the civil war will be completely uncontrollable.</p>
<p>He also said that the Communist Army's war does not intend to incite a revolution to overthrow the government.</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan Plans 1 Billion to Quickly Relieve Disaster Victims in Shandong Province</h3>

The remaining 700 million yuan will be allocated soon.</p>

<h3>Yu Bin Arrives in Shanghai and Talks About Impressions of His Trip North: The Northeast's Industry Awaits Revival, With a Solid Foundation, It Won't Be Difficult to Restore Its Former Glory</h3>
<p>[This City News] Northeast Relief Association representatives Yu Bin and Wang Xiaolai flew from the capital to Beiping on August 6th, then went to Shenyang, Jinzhou, Sipingjie, Changchun and other places in the Northeast to comfort the refugees. They completed their mission and returned to Beiping on August 23rd. Archbishop Yu Bin transferred from Beiping to Jinan on the 30th, staying for three days. He met with General Wang Yaowu, Commander of the Second Pacification Zone. He flew back to Shanghai from Jinan on the evening of the 3rd. A reporter visited Mr. Yu at the Catholic Welfare Association yesterday. Here is a record of his conversation:</p>
<p>Situation in Shandong: Jinan has been surrounded by the Communist army several times. Outsiders believe that the military and civilians in the city are extremely anxious. However, what I saw when I arrived in Jinan was not the case. The military and civilians in the city are full of vitality. The city defense is solid, and the public security is very good. The situation in the entire Shandong province is also good.</p>
<p>Progress Outside the Pass: Generally speaking, the people outside the pass are very calm. Since Chairman Chiang personally visited the Northeast, there has been much progress. In terms of industry, although the heavy industry base suffered significant losses after being removed by the Soviet Union and destroyed by the Communist Party, because of its grand scale in the past, the remaining equipment is still better than that of the provinces inside the pass, and the foundation is very good. If a large amount of capital can be invested to supplement some of the equipment, it will be very easy to restore the original scale. Recently, most of the Japanese technical personnel have been repatriated. The compatriots outside the pass hope that Shanghai industrialists will be willing to go outside the pass to work together for industrial restoration. They explained in detail to Mr. Wang Xiaolai that there are more than 4,500 factories in the Shenyang area of ​​the Northeast alone, which are now under the unified management of the Northeast Production Administration. Mr. Wu Tiecheng once said, "If you don't go to the Northeast, you don't know how big the Northeast is." I can say: "If you don't go to the Northeast, you don't know how great the industrial potential of China is." The agricultural production in the Northeast this year is very abundant. Fertile fields reached 120%, and barren fields also reached about 60%. Except for some areas in Liaobei Province, where spring plowing failed due to Communist disturbances, all other areas have generally had a bumper harvest. The soybeans and sorghum on the Songhua River are boundless, truly worthy of the name of the national granary.</p>
<p>Takeover Work: As for the takeover work, generally speaking, I have not heard of any cases of corruption. However, after most of the factories were taken over, they often failed to start operations quickly. Among the takeover projects, the most noteworthy is the "Xiaofeng Man Power Plant" in Yongji. During the puppet Manchukuo period, the plant could generate 560,000 kilowatts, and the maximum capacity could be 1 million kilowatts. The plant's power could supply the civil and industrial needs of "Northern Manchuria" and "Southern Manchuria." After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the internal equipment was first removed by the Soviet Union, and then destroyed by the Communist Party. The remaining machines can only generate 130,000 kilowatts of electricity. Its power transmission area is still under the control of the Communist Party. Currently, only 30,000 kilowatts of electricity can be generated, and the remaining 100,000 kilowatts are stopped and not used, which is a pity.</p>
<p>Northeast Lacks Cotton: Speaking of the hardships of the people's livelihood, the Archbishop personally understands the lives of the people in the Northeast. There is no problem with food and housing, but the lack of cotton makes winter clothing a problem. In the blink of an eye, October is approaching, and the snowy season in the Northeast is approaching. Tens of millions of compatriots and 300,000 soldiers are in great need of cotton-padded clothing. If the Northeast Relief Branch cannot plan relief as soon as possible, it is feared that tens of thousands of people will freeze to death.</p>
<p>Vigorous Popular Sentiment: Finally, Mr. Yu said: The decision to go to the Northeast made me deeply feel that the Northeast people lack a sense of security and stability. This trip to the Northeast shows that the vigorous popular sentiment is full of new atmosphere. I hope that the people of the country and friendly countries can also have a new understanding of the Northeast. Changchun has now become one of the few modernized cities in the country. The magnificence of the buildings makes people forget its original appearance. It is heard that the enemy and puppet regime once planned to build a "Japanese Palace" in the city, with the intention of moving the capital from Tokyo to Changchun. The Continental Science Academy left by the enemy is extremely grand in scale. In addition, the self-defense forces in various parts of the Northeast have been universally established, step by step, and the defense is extremely solid.</p>
<h3>Our Minister to the Holy See, Xie, Receives the Grand Cross Medal</h3>

<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Assembly Meeting: Shen Honglie Attends and Reports</h3>
<p>[Hangzhou, This Newspaper, 4th] The Zhejiang Provincial Assembly held its first plenary session today, chaired by Speaker Zhang Qiang. Provincial Chairman Shen Honglie reported on the government's policy and future work, and passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Chiang. The meeting adjourned in the afternoon. Also, the Hangzhou City Assembly postponed its closing to the 6th due to the large number of proposals that could not be discussed on schedule. The Assembly decided to request the Two Roads Bureau to add a branch line from Hangzhou to Jianqiao to facilitate transportation.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Implements New County System: Actively Expanding and Merging Townships</h3>
<p>[Suzhou, This Newspaper, 4th] This county is implementing a new county system and is actively handling the expansion and merger of townships to improve the grassroots political system. It has now been decided to divide the county into nine districts, namely: (1) Suzhou District, (2) Wuxi District, (3) , (4) Huangdai District, (5) Yangcheng District, (6) Songbei District, (7) Songnan District, (8) Dongshan District, (9) Xishan District.

<h3>French Banking Group Representatives Arrive in Nanjing to Discuss the Construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] Representatives of the French banking group participating in the negotiations for the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, Shabanai, and representatives of the China Construction Bank arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 4th.

<h3>Two Honored Guests at the Chairman's Headquarters: One Representative Each from the Shaanxi and Shandong Youth League's Farmers and Workers: Attending Last Night's Dinner Without Losing Their True Colors</h3>
<p>[Kuling Central News Agency, 4th] Tong Huaizheng, a young farmer from Shaanxi, and Shen Shirong, a young worker from Shandong, attended the dinner at the Chairman's Headquarters at 7:30 p.m. on the afternoon of the 4th, and were honored guests received by the Chairman. They respectively represent the vast number of young farmers and workers in Shaanxi and Shandong, came to Kuling to participate in the Second National Congress of the Youth League, and were elected as members of the Presidium. They are still dressed as farmers and workers, without losing their true colors, mixed among some Western-dressed and extravagantly dressed representatives, showing the universality and mass nature of the composition of the Youth League. They and the 26 members of the Presidium of the National Congress accepted the Chairman's special invitation to dine at the Chairman's Headquarters. During the dinner, they were deeply favored by the Chairman, and were asked for their opinions on improving the League's affairs. They each made statements from the perspective of farmers and workers, which were highly praised by the Chairman. At the same time, Zhang Sheng, Liu Yi, Song Zhigang, Ren Guorong, Yang Guojun, Chen Yiyun, Xu Suyu and other eight student and women representatives on the Presidium were also inquired by the Chairman about their age, origin and academic experience until they dispersed at 9:30 p.m.</p>
<h3>Minister of Food Xu Kan Reports: Bumper Harvests Everywhere This Year: The Establishment of "Ever-Normal Granaries" Is Difficult to Achieve for Now</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] This reporter recently interviewed Minister Xu Kan, who had just arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai, about food supply and the widely spread "Ever-Normal Granaries." Mr. first told me: "This year, God blesses us, and we celebrate the bumper harvest." The annual harvests in all parts of the country are good. It is true that the weather has been hot recently, which is of great benefit to the autumn rice. In addition, Siamese rice, Vietnamese rice and Argentine wheat flour are arriving continuously, so there is no problem with the supply of military and civilian food. In Shanghai alone, food prices are stable, and Wushan rice has fallen to around 30,000 yuan. The people of Shanghai prefer white japonica rice, and they still find tribute rice too rough, which is a major problem. As for the rumor that "Ever-Normal Granaries" will be established to avoid low grain prices hurting farmers, it is difficult to realize at present because it is not easy to build warehouses. There are two main tasks today: (1) To stabilize prices and lower the prices of goods other than food, so as to avoid the price difference between grain prices and the prices of daily necessities and fuel being too large; (2) To evenly transport grain so that the price of grain in grain-deficient areas is reduced, which can maintain the stability of grain prices in grain-producing areas. In fact, the fact that there is no shortage of food supply in the country relies on the smooth transportation. The Ministry of Food has made every effort to solve this problem.</p>
<h3>Minister of Finance Yu Clearly States: Government Bonds Will Be Repaid at Face Value: Rumors of Double Repayment Are All False</h3>
<p>[Nanjing Central News Agency, 4th] Recently, the Shanghai bond market has risen again, and rumors of double repayment have been widely spread. The Central News Agency reporter specially visited Minister Yu Hongjun to inquire about the truth. He said that the government's bond repayment at face value has been announced by the Ministry of Finance and clearly stated by President Song, and will never be changed. The various rumors outside are unfounded and are being used by speculators. They should not be easily believed or blindly followed.</p>
<h3>The Great Traitor Wang Yitang Is on Trial: He Remains Silent in Court, Only Saying "I Deserve to Be Shot": The Hebei High Court Scheduled the Verdict for the Morning of the 7th</h3>
<p>[Beiping Central News Agency, 3rd] He Chengshuo, presiding judge of the Criminal Division of the Hebei High Court, prosecutor Xu Yuli and others, accompanied by bailiffs, went to the First Prison this morning to interrogate the great traitor Wang Yitang. Starting at 10:00 a.m., two servants carried the traitor Wang from cell number five to the temporary court in the prison and placed him on a reclining chair. First, Judge He described in detail the twelve points of crimes committed by the traitor Wang during his tenure as chairman of the Puppet North China Political Affairs Committee. The traitor Wang remained silent, and only his lawyers, Li Yishen and Wang Zanxi, defended him for an hour. The judge then said to the traitor Wang that if he did not speak at this time, there would be no more opportunity to speak in the future. The traitor Wang then replied: "I did not hear clearly the twelve points of crimes mentioned by the judge, and I have nothing to say. I deserve to be shot." The judge then announced that the verdict would be announced at 10:00 a.m. on September 7. The court adjourned at 1:30 p.m. and the traitor Wang was carried back to his cell. Also, the great traitors Guan Yixian, Lin Wenlong, Zhao Xinbo, Wu Zanzhou, Zhu Shushen and others will also be publicly tried in the near future, and evidence is being actively collected.</p>
<p>[Nanjing Central News Agency, 4th] The Capital High Court announced verdicts in two cases of Chinese traitors on the 4th: (1) Chen Yunwen was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment. Chen was originally a secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and later followed the traitor Wang to leave, serving as director of the Legislative Bureau of the Puppet Executive Yuan, permanent vice-minister of the Puppet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and counselor of the Puppet National Government. (2) Luo Huatang, a puppet agent, was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment.</p>

It is heard that this suggestion was discussed and accepted at the UNRRA conference held in Geneva this time. The UNRRA office in China may not be closed until the end of 1947.</p>
<h3>Linpu Town, Xiaoshan, Zhejiang Province, Prepares to Elect Miss Linpu</h3>

<h3>Minister Chen Receives Reporters, Continued from Page 1</h3>
<p>Communist Demands: Question: How does the Minister view the two additional demands made by the Communist Party at the Five-Person Conference? Answer: Please recall the actions of the Communist army after the announcement of the ceasefire agreement on January 13. You can see who is destroying the agreement. All battles, such as those on the Longhai Road and Li Xiannian's attacks, were caused by the Communist army's prior attacks. If the Communist army stops its attacks, the National Army will never attack. The best guarantee for the Communist army's so-called ceasefire is to implement the troop reorganization plan signed by the Three-Person Group. The troop reorganization plan of Mr. Ma, Mr. Zhang, and Mr. Zhou is interrelated in three aspects, namely the ceasefire agreement, the restoration of transportation, and the troop reorganization plan, which must be implemented simultaneously. Question: Recently, Yan'an claimed that the Xi'an military authorities ordered the withdrawal of the Eighteenth Group Army Office. What does this mean? Answer: This move by the government is nationwide. All military offices have been ordered to withdraw, not specifically targeting the Eighteenth Group Army. Question: If Ambassador Stuart's Five-Person Conference achieves something, does Your Excellency think that a full ceasefire can be achieved? Answer: I sincerely hope that the Five-Person Conference will achieve something. In this way, transportation, ceasefire, and all other issues can be resolved in conjunction. Question: After the Communist Party announced the mobilization order, what has been the reaction in the Communist-occupied areas? Answer: As far as I know, the people of Yutai have launched a resistance movement against the Communist army. The Communist army lurking in Suqian, Suining and other places has been bound and sent to the National Army by the local people. The people's aversion to the Communist army is evident.</p>
<p>So-called Conditions: Question: The Communist Party demands the cancellation of the five demands. Can the government agree? Answer: The so-called five demands are not any conditions. The troop reorganization plan stipulated that the Communist army would station one division in the Northeast and the government army would station fourteen divisions. On June 7, the Communist Party demanded to increase to five divisions in the Northeast. After Marshal Ma's compromise, it was increased to three divisions. This proves that it is not a condition, but a change in the entire plan. If the Communist army increases in the Northeast, it should decrease elsewhere. The Communist army must demand how many provinces and counties to occupy in the Northeast. The government believes that if the Northeast occupies too much, other parties should occupy less. Northern Jiangsu poses too great a threat to Nanjing and Shanghai, so please let it go. As a result, the Communist Party's proposals can be accepted by the government, but the government's proposals are rejected by the Communist Party. Therefore, if it can be implemented in accordance with the troop reorganization plan of February 25, there are no conditions at all.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Rebirth of India</h3>
<p>Jawaharlal Nehru, President of the Interim Government of India, was sworn into office in New Delhi on the second of this month. The establishment of this government symbolizes the rebirth of India. According to news reports, although this interim government is led by the leader of the Congress Party, its members include representatives of the Sikh community, leaders of the Parsi community, and representatives of the Muslim and Christian communities, which can be said to be fully representative. When he was sworn into office, Nehru called on the Indian people not to conflict with each other, but to cooperate together, with an open attitude, which is truly worthy of our admiration.</p>
<p>China and India are adjacent to each other. In the past, when transportation was difficult, there was still contact between China and India. Fa Xian, Xuanzang and others did not consider the dangers of the mountains and the vastness of the ocean, and went to India. This resolute spirit made the relationship between the Chinese and Indian people closer. Today, although the spread of Buddhism in India has almost disappeared, Buddhist thought is deeply imprinted in the minds of the Chinese people. Vegetarianism, non-killing, and the concept of reincarnation and nirvana all originated in India, and these concepts still play a role among even the uneducated Chinese villagers. In terms of cultural relations, the relationship between China and India can be said to be very deep. During the Second World War, India was also the main route of our international transportation, and the relationship between China and India became more frequent. Therefore, the Chinese people are full of joy and hope for the rebirth of India. May the Chinese and Indian people be able to work together more closely in the future, and work together to build a new world after the war and maintain lasting peace after the war.</p>
<p>What we regret is that the establishment of the interim government of India this time did not receive the cooperation of the Muslim League led by Jinnah, so that the day the interim government was established was the time when Muslim riots began. Muslims in various places either hung black flags or wore black veils to parade in the streets to show their opposition, and there were bloodshed incidents. How the situation will develop is still difficult to predict at this time. The non-cooperation of the Muslim League has not weakened the power of the interim government, because the interim government already includes representatives of the Muslim side for the time being, but the existence of such a non-cooperative political group is naturally easy to cause domestic unrest. Moreover, according to a United Press report from Bombay on the 3rd, Jinnah told people, even hinting that the Soviet Union's attention to Indian affairs may exceed that of a bystander. It can be seen that the Indian situation is actually related to the evolution of the entire Middle East situation. Therefore, we sincerely hope that both the followers of Hinduism and the Muslim League can be tolerant and seek ways and foundations for cooperation with each other, so that the rebirth of India this time will not be frustrated. As the interim government of India is established, we hereby express our congratulations and wish President Nehru good health.</p>
<h3>From Rationing to Allocation</h3>
<p>The biggest drawbacks of rationing are two: (1) black markets arise for goods; (2) goods flow into the black market.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for this, such as too loose control, inaccurate calculations, and the inability to grasp all materials, etc.; but the most important reason is that the difference between the rationed price and the market price is too large, and the amount of goods allocated is too small to meet actual needs. Because supply cannot meet demand, black markets arise; because black markets are profitable, allocated goods inevitably flow into the black market. Therefore, to eliminate the black market, in addition to reasonably adjusting the rationed price, it is of course necessary to increase the quota at the same time. If the quota is too small, the black market cannot be eliminated unless the rationed price is raised to the level of the black market. At present, the rationed prices of many rationed goods often fluctuate, which is actually no different from following the black market. The reason for this lies here.</p>
<p>The price of sugar was adjusted the day before yesterday. Now, black market sugar has been selling for more than 200,000 yuan, while the rationed price is always pegged to the original price of 70,000 yuan, which is tantamount to creating opportunities for speculators. Just look at the newly established sugar stores that have sprung up recently, which can prove how generous the profits are!</p>
<p>Therefore, we do not think that this adjustment is surprising. What is considered surprising is the point of rationing as much as possible. If, as the authorities claim, they will ration as much as possible in the future, then the black market can at least be expected to ease somewhat, and the rationed price announced will also be expected to be relatively lasting.</p>
<p>However, the purpose of rationing is to save materials. In other words, because materials are not sufficient, rationing is necessary. If production is abundant and there is no shortage, then it should be possible to buy and sell freely. In the rationing measures announced this time, there is also the point that "sugar purchase certificates" will be issued to citizens of this city, which is a very noteworthy thing. How these sugar purchase certificates will be issued and how they will be rationed has not yet been announced, so we need not speculate. However, one point can be pointed out in advance, that is, we are about to move from rationing to allocation. We know that to truly save materials and seek a reasonable distribution, allocation is indeed indispensable. Allocation is meticulous, comprehensive, and very scientific, which is very different from the rough and general rationing method. However, allocation is also much more difficult to implement than rationing. Since the authorities have this determination, we hope that they will prepare carefully and distribute accurately. It is best to set up another agency specifically to handle this matter. Because what should be allocated is actually not just sugar; what can be allocated is not just sugar. Recently, private parties have often heard this suggestion, and the central government also seems to have this plan. It seems that it is possible to start with sugar and establish a scale.</p>

Since Molotov had not yet returned to Paris at that time, Vyshinsky represented the Soviet Union. Today's meeting was convened at Vyshinsky's request.

<h3>Major Retail Sales in the United States, Nylon Stockings Sell for Only One U.S. Dollar After Work, Amazing Automobile Production</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 3rd] Competition in the U.S. retail industry is becoming increasingly intense. Major department stores have launched discount campaigns to attract customers. The volume of retail goods continues to be 25% to 40% higher than last year, and in many categories, there is almost a shortage of supply. However, under the new policy, prices have been reduced. For example, men's white shirts have been reduced from US$3.95 per piece to US$2.66. Nylon stockings are selling for only US$1.20 per pair, and many other goods are being sold for only 15% higher than the wholesale price, and all are lower than the price limits set by the Price Administration. Competition in the automobile manufacturing industry is also quite intense. A total of 250,000 new automobiles were produced in August, and it is hoped that a total of 2.475 million will be produced in 1946. The estimated demand is between 13 million and 17 million units. The Yokosuka residence was sold. Prince Nashimoto also sold his Takajo residence for 400,000 yuan. Prince Takamatsu, the third younger brother of Hirohito, also sold his Takanawa residence and moved into a smaller house. Currently, the Japanese imperial family is concerned about the property tax issue. It is said that Prince Takamatsu has the most property among the imperial family, at 15 million yuan, followed by Prince Nashimoto at about 3.5 million yuan. Prince Mikasa, the fourth younger brother of Hirohito, has the least, at about one million yuan. According to the property tax rate, 76% of the property value should be collected. For example, Prince Kaya's property is only 1.5 million yuan. After deducting property tax, he only has 360,000 yuan left, which is not easy to maintain his current lifestyle. Therefore, he can no longer hire a chauffeur and drives himself. Prince Fushimi takes a bath once every four days to save fuel, and his children can only take the tram or walk to school. The Princes Kitashirakawa and Takeda are cultivating their gardens and having their children grow vegetables.</p>
<h3>Japanese Imperial Family at the End of the Road, Selling Real Estate and Growing Vegetables</h3>
<p>[Kaizo Company, Tokyo, 4th] Since MacArthur announced the abolition of their privileges in May, the Japanese imperial family has had their monthly living expenses of 10,000 yen, which were paid by the Imperial Household Ministry, stopped, and all other preferential treatments have also ceased. In addition, they must pay all taxes, including income tax, land tax, and property tax, just like ordinary citizens. To establish a new way of life, they can only cut spending, selling luxury items such as cars, valuable furniture, utensils, and works of art to pay for living expenses. Some want to sell large houses or villas. For example, Prince Takeda has already sold his</p>

<h3>Masterminded the Murders of Three Reporters and Two Judges, One of the Leading Figures of "76" in Western Shanghai, Xia Zhongming Retracts Confession During Retrial, Wen Lantong and Chen Jicheng to Be Interrogated Today</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The High Court is scheduled to hear the case of Wen Lantong, the former Chairman of the National Commercial Control Association, at 10:00 AM today. Whether or not he will appear in court remains a mystery. In the afternoon, the cases of Chen Jicheng, the former ambassador to Manchukuo, and Mao Tiemei, an intelligence officer of the former Nanjing Political Security Bureau, will be heard.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The High Court yesterday heard several cases of suspected traitors. Xia Zhongming, 45 years old, from Shanghai, was the chief clerk of the city's police headquarters before the war. After the war began, he served as the supply director of the Shanghai National Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Force Headquarters. He was later captured by the enemy and defected in August 1939, serving as Li Shiqun's Japanese translator, the leader of the direct group of the former Special Operations Headquarters, the executive deputy director of the former Investigation and Statistics Department, and the director of the Shanghai Office, among other positions. He was also a leading figure of "76." He was arrested after the victory and prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office. He was interrogated by the High Court once before. At the retrial yesterday afternoon, the defendant was wearing a gray serge long gown, with a small-checked cotton short shirt and trousers underneath, and yellow leather shoes. His back was slightly hunched, and his face was thin. He denied all the confessions he made to the Military Intelligence Bureau, claiming that they were made under duress. He also denied all the terrorist incidents inquired about by the court, such as presiding over the assassinations of Zhu Xinggong of the Chinese-language Ta Mei Evening News, Zhang Sixu of the English-language Ta Mei Evening News, Jin Huating of the Shen Bao, Qian Hongye, the criminal division chief of the Special District Local Court, Yu Hua, the criminal division chief of the Special District High Court, and the kidnapping of employees of the Bank of China and the Farmers Bank, claiming that he did not know about them or was not in Shanghai at the time. He claimed that he had rescued more than 30 arrested Youth League members and many underground workers. The court then summoned Zhang Hongwei and Wang Ming, both of whom testified that the defendant had rescued them. Later, Xu Weizhen, the former president of the former Shanghai High Court, who had already been sentenced, was questioned in detail about the assassination of Qian Tingwei and the "76" takeover of the Special District Court. Xu denied any involvement in the matter. The court ordered that the case be reheard at a later date.</p>
<h3>Concealing Shao Shijun's Assets as a Traitor, Shen Shubao Continues Trial and Is Released on Bail</h3>
<p>Shao Shijun, the former Director of the Su-Zhe-Wan Unified Tax Bureau of the former Reformed Government and the former Director of the Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance of the former National Government, disappeared without a trace after the victory. The amount he had amassed over the years was unknown, hence the nickname "God of Wealth." On August 11 last year, after hearing the news of the enemy's surrender, his wife, Jiang Dongrong (also known as Dongrong), packed some valuables and jewelry into five leather boxes and a steel safe, and deposited them in the clinic of Dr. Shen Shubao at 195 Ma Huo Road. She later opened the safe, removed some valuables, and stored them in a type B safe deposit box number 703 at the Shanghai West District Branch of the Four Banks Trust Department and safe deposit box number 85 at the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank, both rented under Shen Shubao's name. Later, after the authorities pursued Jiang Dongrong, she confessed the previous events, and Shen Shubao's wife also voluntarily reported the matter to the City Party Headquarters, and the traitorous assets were recovered. Shen Shubao was then prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office for the crime of concealing traitorous assets, along with Shao Shijun and others. However, because Shao himself is still at large and has not been apprehended, he is still wanted. Therefore, only Shen Shubao was interrogated at the hearing yesterday afternoon. Shen testified that he knew Jiang Dongrong because he had treated her for an illness. Last year, she rented a ward in his clinic, and later came with her sister, Jiang Donghua, claiming that her sister was getting married and needed to deposit some clothes and ornaments. On October 11, she suddenly came with several armed soldiers and took away some of the boxes. When he returned home at night, he learned that the property belonged to Shao Shijun. His wife then voluntarily reported the matter to the City Party Headquarters. The court ordered that the case be reheard at a later date, and the defendant remained on bail.</p>
<p>On the same day, the cases of Rao Shu, the former Chief Inspector of the Special High Section, and Shan Xinfa were heard. Witnesses were questioned and detained for further hearings.</p>
<h3>Xu Tieshan Sentenced to Three Years Imprisonment, Gu Huanzhang to Be Sentenced on the 11th</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Xu Tieshan, the former Director of the Central China Tobacco Distribution Association, was sentenced to three years imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for three years by the High Court yesterday.</p>
<p>On the same day, the case of Gu Huanzhang, the former Chairman of the Shanghai Leather Industry Association, was concluded and is scheduled to be sentenced on the 11th of this month.</p>
<h3>Xie Wenda and Others Prosecuted</h3>
<p>[Another Report] The High Prosecutor's Office has prosecuted the suspected traitors Xie Wenda, Fu Shaofa, Fan Danian, Wang Shoulun, Wu Wenkui (also known as Little Wu), Jin Yuzhen, and Fan Qishan. Another three cases, Zhu Guilin, Chen Shusheng, and Lin Liangwei, were not prosecuted due to insufficient evidence.</p>
<h3>Xue Jianqiu Case Resolved, Transferred to District Court for Handling</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The main culprits in the Xue Jianqiu "kidnapping" case, Zhang Xifu and others, after being transferred from the Garrison Command Military Law Department, were found after several investigations not to have intended to kidnap and extort. They had merely encountered Xue Jianqiu midway, identified him as a traitor, and used intimidation to make him feel fearful in order to obtain money. They later went to bars, dance halls, and barbershops together. Xue Jianqiu could have refused to comply and reported the crime to the police at any time, and did not completely lose his free will. As for the detention in the guard room of a building in the central district, it was still nothing more than a method of intimidation to obtain money. Based on the precedent of the Supreme Court's Ruling No. 976 of 1929, the act of private detention for the purpose of intimidating someone into handing over property should be punished as a serious crime of intimidation. Since these culprits are not military personnel, they will be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office today for handling.</p>

<h3>The 行總's Large Number of Vessels Are Handed Over to Various Shipping Companies for Management. Liu Hongsheng Convened Various Companies to Discuss Methods</h3>
<p>In order to solve operational difficulties and to expedite the transport of relief supplies, 行總 Executive Director Liu Hongsheng is preparing to hand over all of the 行總's vessels to various shipping companies for management, with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company also invited to participate. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, representatives from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) including Mr. Kirk, 行總 representatives including Director Chen Guangyuan, and shipping industry representatives including Li Yunliang, Cheng Yuzhai, and Wei Huanzhang were specially invited to a meeting. Hosted by Chairman Liu Hongsheng, the meeting discussed methods for handing over 行總's large number of vessels to various shipping companies for management. The meeting lasted for three hours and the results were very satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Private Companies Oppose Monopoly</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] One hundred and twenty-five private shipping companies are deeply dissatisfied because the 行總 and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company have exclusively established a temporary contract, with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company monopolizing the transport of relief supplies and other companies unable to share in the benefits. It is rumored that they will take joint action. When reporters inquired about this with the 行總's person in charge, the following response was received: 行總 Director Jiang stated at a meeting of the Far East Committee that no shipping company should monopolize the distribution of relief goods. The current agreement with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, where 行總 vessels are handed over to the company to transport relief supplies, is entirely because the company has wider shipping routes and more complete facilities and equipment (such as wharves and warehouses). There is no matter of monopolization. According to the agreement, if there is extra cargo space when the vessels return after transporting 行總's supplies, commercial goods can be loaded. This provision is purely to avoid empty return trips and has no other meaning. The main reason for the 125 shipping companies' attack on the 行總 is that other companies also desperately need vessels and equipment due to war losses, but the 行總 has never allowed them to transport materials on their behalf. Now that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is enjoying the benefits alone, it is inevitably unfair.</p>

The ship is currently undergoing repairs and completing procedures for going abroad. If this initiative is realized, it can be described as a pioneering feat of Chinese ships sailing abroad.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] The case of Korean Sun Tianchang providing military supplies to the enemy has been thoroughly investigated by the 消查團, which believes that there is indeed evidence of providing aid to the enemy, so it was transferred to the District Court Procuratorate for investigation.

It is reported that Sun's wife, Zhao Dongshan, has been actively lobbying recently and has hired lawyers Jiang Yiping and others to defend Sun.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Rectifies Financial Discipline; Orders Dao Heng Bank to Suspend Operations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Shanghai Dao Heng Bank was originally approved by the Central Bank as a Class A foreign exchange business.

<h3>Two War Criminals, Matsuda and Kawashima, to be Tried by US Court This Morning; Accused of Mistreating Prisoners of War in Changchun</h3>
<p>Following the Hong Kong case, the US military court will try Japanese war criminals Colonel Matsuda and Captain Kawashima at 8:00 AM this morning at Tilanqiao Prison. They are accused of mistreating American soldiers in Changchun. The former was the director of the Japanese Changchun Prisoner of War Management Office, and the latter was a medical officer managing prisoners of war. Both committed extreme cruelty against the American prisoners of war in Changchun. US Army Lieutenant Colonel Hankins and Sergeant Gagnet were the most severely mistreated. They arrived in Shanghai from the US a few days ago to testify against the two war criminals. Hankins was arrested by the Japanese army during the Pearl Harbor incident in 1942 and transferred to the Changchun prisoner of war camp, where he was released when the Soviet army entered Changchun in 1945. Hankins served in the military for 18 years and suffered oppression and abuse by the Japanese in Changchun. He will now testify. Sergeant Gagnet became blind during his captivity due to mistreatment and is accompanied by his wife on this trip to Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Auctions Confiscated Goods; Investigation Team Notes Two Points: Whether the Auction Should Occur and Whether the Procedures Are Legal; All Accounting Books Will Be Sent to the Audit Bureau for Review</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Regarding the 4 billion yuan embezzlement case, Zhang Qingzhen from the investigation team personally visited Mayor Wu the day before yesterday to inquire about the proceedings. It is now learned that Mayor Wu made a special phone call to Committee Member Zhang at 10:00 AM yesterday to correct what he said the day before about the audit bureau participating in the auction of pseudo-Central Market goods during his term, saying that it was a temporary memory error. He also said that the auction method still followed the method during Mayor Qian's term, and the audit bureau did not actually participate. Furthermore, according to Committee Member Zhang's statement to reporters: The Municipal Government Confiscated Goods Management Office's entire inventory of confiscated goods, accounts, and auction records are planned to be submitted to the Shanghai Office of the Audit Department of the Control Yuan for review. However, yesterday, Committee Member Zhang visited Director Xie Haoling, but because the accounting books had not yet been retrieved, they were not brought back. Committee Member Zhang also stated that there are two key points in this case: (1) Responsibility Issue: The municipal government should not auction off these goods to fund welfare undertakings, because other cities do not have such a large amount of enemy-pseudo goods, so how will employee welfare be handled? Therefore, the use of such goods should be centrally planned and distributed by the state. The municipal government does not seem to have the right to handle them. (2) Procedural Issues: Whether the auction procedures are legal and whether the income and expenditure figures match still need to be reviewed by experts from the Audit Bureau before it can be known whether there are any abuses. According to the municipal government's report to the investigation team: As of May 27 of this year, the Xingye Trust Company handled the pseudo-Central Market goods on behalf of the municipal government, with a total value of 3.031981 billion yuan. The total expenditure for employee welfare and the city's education fund was 3.00813542 billion yuan. This matter was handled by General Manager Xu Baohua of Xingye Trust Company, together with Qian Jianqiu, a city government counselor, under the orders of Mayor Qian. Later, after the municipal government was reorganized in May, Xu Baohua, general manager of Xingye Trust Company, resigned, and Xie Haoling, director of the Confiscated Goods Management Office, was appointed by the municipal government, together with Qian Jianqiu, to continue handling the matter. All the procedures are recorded in files and inventories for verification.</p>

We are preparing to hold a comprehensive symposium. We are very grateful that Professor Pei Fei can attend. We hope that Professor Pei Fei can share his impressions after coming to China, because China has undergone many changes after eight years of war. I believe Professor Pei Fei will have good opinions."</p>
<p>Professor Pei Fei then delivered a speech, stating: "Since coming to China, I feel that the general observation of Chinese people is that the domestic political situation is a reflection of international problems. Whether this view is correct remains to be proven by facts. We don't want to say more. As for why Japan suffered such a disastrous defeat, it was based on its own stupidity and arrogance. When the Lugouqiao Incident broke out, I expressed in Japan that if Japan did not abandon its policy of aggression against China, it would inevitably encounter a tragic fate unprecedented in history." After Professor Pei's speech, the committee members discussed Far Eastern issues with him, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. The symposium adjourned around 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>It Is Difficult to Reduce the Proportional Amount of Banquet Tax</h3>
<p>The banquet industry in this city is quite unclear about the collection of banquet tax stipulated by the Municipal Finance Bureau. They listed several points and submitted them for instructions but did not receive a reply. Yesterday afternoon, they specially sent several representatives to the bureau to ask Director Gu for instructions. Deputy Director Hu Wenzhi received them and answered various questions. It is said that the banquet tax is collected on behalf of the government, and the above tax rate cannot be considered for reduction. The unified account form made by the bureau is a necessary measure for tax collection. The reason for making the bureau's form is only to standardize the format for easy inspection. All legitimate restaurants should support and promote it and not oppose it. All small restaurants whose meals sold do not exceed 1,200 yuan can use the meal ticket method to avoid banquet tax.</p>

<h3>Coffin Shop Owner's Jests Lead to Future Troubles; Five People Detained for Intimidation and Assault</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Shen Longxing, the owner of the Longxing Coffin Shop on Fuxing East Road in Nanshi, married a woman named Jin, but they had no children. Zhang Chen, a 31-year-old Ningbo woman who was a servant from a certain family at 41 Tonglu Road, was attractive, and Shen had jokingly said he wanted to marry her as a concubine, but due to their social status, it was never done. Who knew that this was heard by outsiders, and a group of gangsters, knowing that Shen Longxing had accumulated wealth, conspired to extort money. At 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, a man dressed in a military uniform, holding a weapon, led two men in plainclothes to the coffin shop, intending to talk to the owner. Shen was away in the countryside, so his wife, Shen Jin, came out to meet them.

<h3>Statement by the Garrison Command Regarding the Return of the Ransom Money in the Rong Case</h3>
<p>After the Garrison Command released the news that the 245,000 US dollars in recovered loot from the Rong case would be returned to Rong Desheng, some people argued that the money should be used for disaster relief instead of being returned. Lawyers in the city also expressed their opinions. Yesterday, the Military Law Office of the Garrison Command, which handled the case, issued a statement explaining the reasons for returning the money: (1) Except for cases where the defendant is a soldier, bandit cases should be tried by the judicial organs in accordance with the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations. However, due to the special circumstances in the Songhu area, the Army Headquarters submitted a report to the National Government, which approved it as a martial law area and authorized the General Headquarters to handle bandit cases in accordance with the Martial Law. The Rong Desheng kidnapping incident is a crime under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 9 of the Regulations for the Suppression of Bandits. Therefore, it will be tried by this headquarters. (2) The ransom money in the Rong case is the property obtained by the bandits and should be returned to the victim in accordance with Article 7, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations for the Suppression of Bandits. As for how to dispose of the ransom money after it is returned, it is Rong Desheng's right and not something that the judicial organs can decide on his behalf. (3) The current Regulations for the Suppression of Bandits are different from the expired Regulations for the Suppression of Kidnappers. There is no explicit penalty for Rong Xingsheng's family asking others to pay the ransom, so Rong Desheng cannot be given any crime. Whether the current Regulations for the Suppression of Bandits are suitable for the current public security needs of Shanghai is a legislative issue, and this headquarters is not in a position to comment.</p>

<h3>A Mobile Kitchen Capable of Feeding 10,000 People Daily: Chefs Must Be Trained, To Be Shipped to Hengyang Within a Week to Help Famine Victims</h3>
<p>The Wanren, a vessel belonging to the Water Transport Brigade of the Executive Yuan, loaded with four mobile kitchens, approximately one thousand tons of food, and other utensils, is scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Hengyang, Hunan Province, within this week for disaster relief. Each mobile kitchen has four large wheels and is equipped with a water tank. It is powered by two trucks and has six large iron pots inside. Using coal, wood, or oil for fuel, it can cook soup, vegetables, porridge, etc., within 30 minutes, enough to feed 600 people or 10,000 people daily. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has allocated a total of 32 such kitchens to China. One of them, donated by the Australian government, is already in use in Hengyang. Including the four that are about to be shipped, there will be as many as five in the Hengyang area. Within this month, 20 more will be shipped from Australia to Shanghai.

<h3>Recovering the Hearts of the Northeast: Transporting Cultural Provisions</h3>
<p>Ministry of Education Orders Municipal Education Bureau to Comply</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Ministry of Education recently instructed the Municipal Education Bureau: "With the victory of the War of Resistance and the recovery of national territory, the active recovery of the long-occupied Northeast is the unanimous request of the people. Investigating the recovery of the Northeast, it is by no means only the recovery of Northeast materials, but also the recovery of Northeast hearts. In addition to administration, cultural propaganda is obviously an important tool for recovering hearts. Therefore, transporting cultural provisions to various parts of the Northeast is an urgent matter.

<h3>Temporary University Distributes Students: Must Undergo Placement Test</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Nanjing] The Ministry of Education has distributed students from the Nanjing Temporary University Preparatory Class and the Beijing-Shanghai Temporary University Preparatory Class to various schools. It is reported that Nanjing University and Central University will hold placement tests for these distributed students. If their level is adequate, they can attend classes with the regular students. If there are students who do not meet the standards, their classes will be placed behind. However, since the Ministry of Education has already made the distributions, the principle remains unchanged. Some people misunderstood this to mean that they still need to take an entrance examination after being distributed and requested clarification from the Ministry of Education. It is now understood that this is a placement test, not an entrance examination. Students will be placed based on their actual level, and both new and old students will take the same test.</p>

<h3>High Interest Rates · Decreased Sales to Merchants Cotton Yarn Black Market Continues to Plunge Qingdao Goods Are Even Lower Than the Spinning and Weaving Factory's Listed Price Double Horse Rationing Price Was Lowered Again Yesterday by 80,000</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the yarn and cloth market was extremely weak. The Spinning and Weaving Factory's listed prices remained unchanged: 42-count double-strand "Sunlight" at 1.9 million, 32-count double-strand "Xiantao" at 1.8 million (on cones), and 20-count pure cotton grass bale at 1.15 million. However, the market prices fell sharply. 42-count initially decreased to 2.18 million, then fell to 2.15 million. 32-count "Blue Phoenix" was still quoted at 1.8 million, but there were no buyers. The market price of "Xianzi" cone yarn was actually 30,000 lower than the Spinning and Weaving Factory's listed price. Qingdao's 32-count "Maid" goods were sold at 1.495 million, which was more than 100,000 lower than the Spinning and Weaving Factory's asking price. The rationing price of "Double Horse" yesterday dropped from 1.4 million to 1.32 million, but less than 1,000 pieces were rationed. The spot price on the market once fell to 1.47 million, which was 170,000 to 180,000 lower than last week. It then rebounded to 1.52 million due to absorption by Guangdong merchants. The prices of other 20-count brands fell by about 20,000 to 30,000. The prices of 42-count and 32-count fine yarns decreased slightly by about 10,000. People are still not optimistic because of the news that customs has limited re-exports. It is said that from today, anyone purchasing cotton yarn and cloth from this city for transport to Guangdong, Fujian, and other places must apply to the Customs Administration for approval before being allowed to export. If manufacturers in South China have legitimate needs, the Textile Industry Management Committee will formulate rationing measures. Therefore, the appetite of Guangdong merchants has decreased. Because the edge silver is tight, factories dare not take action. Dealers are reluctant to make deals due to tight cash flow and high interest rates, and they are willing to sell at a loss. This is why yarn prices have fallen sharply. According to yarn factory insiders, the flower cloth rationed by the Executive Yuan Relief Administration last time has been settled at the new exchange rate. The market price of flower cloth, which was previously over 90,000, has now risen to 160,000, and it is said that it may rise to 200,000 based on current costs, implying that there is a potential for further price increases. However, according to news from practical manufacturers, yarn factories are now concentrating on delivering goods, and goods are only delivered after payment. Moreover, there is no guarantee of delivery, and the pricing is unknown when applying to purchase yarn each time. It is believed that this is beneficial for yarn factories, but inconvenient for users. Therefore, yesterday's applications for concentrated yarn distribution by private yarn factories were not as enthusiastic as the previous time.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Sold at a Loss · Also Due to Excessive Advances</h3>
<p>The cloth market opened extremely weak, and prices only stabilized at noon. The reason is that the Spinning and Weaving Factory approved the distribution of goods the night before, and many factories and dealers were rationed with non-branded fine cloth made of 20-count warp and weft. Those who could not afford to advance the money had no choice but to sell at a loss. Therefore, the market price of the goods that the Spinning and Weaving Factory distributed at 53,000 yuan was actually as low as 51,000 yuan. Some dyeing and weaving factories took advantage of the weakness to buy in a lot. According to those familiar with the market situation, the fall in cloth prices yesterday was mainly due to three reasons: (1) Extremely tight cash flow, with interest rates as high as 20%, dealers had no intention of advancing money, and factories also shied away. (2) The Spinning and Weaving Factory sold non-branded goods at a high price of 53,000 yuan, and some rumors suggested that the quality was poor, making those with purchase orders even more cautious. (3) Those who applied to purchase non-branded fine cloth the day before were all approved, but since there were few buyers for resale, they were afraid of losing their qualification to open the letter of credit if they gave up, so they did not hesitate to sell at a loss of 2,000. It was also pointed out that the prices of patterned goods that had not been distributed were still firm. "Four Gentlemen" and tribute satin were sold at 70,000 yuan, and the momentum of grey fabrics was also relatively stable. Observers with status commented that the fall in yarn and cloth prices yesterday was entirely due to tight cash flow. They also pointed out that during the "June-bottom public debt" crisis, the tight cash flow was in the financial industry, but now the financial industry had already anticipated the Mid-Autumn Festival cash crunch and secured itself. Moreover, after the foreign exchange rate fluctuations, the government used contractionary monetary policy to stabilize prices, resulting in even tighter liquidity, leaving industry and commerce with no surplus funds.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Fall Back</h3>
<p>Public bonds were somewhat affected by the news report about the Ministry of Finance's rumors, but a major player on the fifth floor was still reportedly absorbing "Unified Wu" on behalf of a certain bank, and people's confidence remained firm. "Unified Bing" opened in the morning at 2,500 yuan, and Tianjin merchants continued to buy, once rising to 2,680 yuan before being suppressed by selling pressure. It fell to 2,290 yuan in the middle of the day. After that, the situation of "Wu" improved, boosting the buying momentum, and it rose to around 2,450 yuan near noon. As a result, it closed 220 yuan lower than the previous day. Jia, Yi, Ding, and Bing were all pulled down by about 150 yuan.</p>
<h3>Second Half of the Year Relief Rice Our Country Gets 280,000 Tons</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] The International Emergency Food Committee, which recently replaced the United Nations Food Bureau, has decided on the following allocations for relief rice in the second half of this year (totaling 1,324,000 tons): China 280,000 tons, India 270,000 tons, Ceylon 180,000 tons, Malaya 170,000 tons, and the Philippines 145,000 tons. Smaller countries will also be allocated proportionally. The committee also emphasized that the global supply and demand of rice still suffers from insufficient supply. If the rations for July to December are allocated according to regulations, the rice-consuming countries will still have enough to eat.</p>
<h3>High Japonica Rice Rises, Indica Rice Stabilizes</h3>
<p>The supply of rice continues, but the declared prices from various producing areas are not cost-effective, and merchants are not very interested. Shops occasionally make small purchases, and Indica rice has entered a stable state. White Yuan rice is scarce and sells well, with prices rising by more than 1,000 yuan. Early-season Japonica rice is already scarce, and late-season rice is being harvested. The supply of goods will inevitably be scarce within the next week. Today, medium-grade rice is the most common, with high-quality rice being rare, and prices rising by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Old white Japonica rice has become unpopular. Registered goods for merchants in the North and South markets total more than 5,000 dan. The Social Affairs Bureau continues to sell Brazilian rice at over 400 bags. Flour shops have turned lukewarm and are slightly weak, falling back by 100 yuan. The digestion of various wheat goods is slow, and purchases are not greedy. All parties are unwilling to sell at a loss due to the inverted relationship between production and sales, forming a stalemate. Soybean shipments from Shantou have stopped, and there are few new arrivals. Xiang Street's appetite is not strong, and high-quality goods are flat, while medium-grade goods have been slightly reduced by 300 to 400 yuan. Corn sales are stagnant, and soybean prices have fallen back by 1,000 yuan. Bran prices have fallen back by 100 yuan. The oil market has risen by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and the approved prices have also been relaxed because producing areas have reported higher prices. Today, all transactions are based on the approved prices.</p>
<h3>Rayon Soars · Up 120,000 Yuan From the Previous Day</h3>
<p>Rayon factory sales are active, and bright rayon is even more popular. Yesterday, market prices rose by more than 100,000 yuan. 120-count "Tianqiao" bright rayon opened in the morning at 2.05 million yuan, and after being bought up, closed at 2.3 million yuan. However, buyers continued to flock in, and the price rose to 2.35 million yuan in the afternoon. Finally, fellow traders traded at 2.36 million yuan, with sellers asking for 2.38 million yuan, a huge increase of 120,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Miscellaneous brands also followed suit. 150-count bright rayon was in great demand, and the price also increased by 120,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The prices of other semi-bright and other goods varied by 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. Factory-direct sales were quieter, and prices hovered around the same level as the previous day. Although there were transactions in silk goods, market prices were stable with no changes.</p>

<p>Since the Spinning and Weaving Factory began rationing rayon, it has reached the tenth period (rationed every Thursday). Rayon dealers and silk weaving factories could all apply. Now, in order to eliminate the black market and meet the actual needs of silk weaving factories, the company has decided to stop accepting rayon dealer applications from the eleventh period (this Thursday). In the future, rationing will be limited to silk weaving factories.</p>
<h3>White Coal Sales Stagnant and Turning Soft</h3>
<p>The arrival of white coal lumps in the coal market is still scarce, but sales are also weaker than before. Market prices are flat with a hint of softness. The Ministry of Economic Affairs' Fuel Committee has reduced the allocation price for Hongji Layer this month by 10,000 yuan, so all grades of white coal have been affected. Although asking prices have not been reduced, sales are extremely sluggish. The arrival of bituminous coal has been hampered by traffic congestion recently. Although market prices have not fluctuated, the market situation is slightly tighter.</p>
<h3>Shrimp Eye Aged Goods Sold Out</h3>
<p>Regarding shrimp eye green tea, which is sold to the African region, insiders say that they have been receiving telegrams requesting goods. However, the cost of new goods is high, making it difficult to export, and the inventory of aged tea is about to be exhausted, so transactions have become quiet. However, export firms are still buying aged "Sleeves," aged "Fine Brows," aged "Needles," Fujian black tea, and Keemun black tea. Sales of coarse black tea are also smooth, and market prices have soared to 48,000 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Amidst Tight Credit Conditions · Securities Mostly Lifeless</h3>
<p>Due to the still fluctuating credit conditions, the public's confidence in Chinese stocks is fragile. When the market opened, it initially rebounded due to the residual momentum of the previous close. Yonghua Yarn rose to 675 yuan after opening, Meiya to 4,030 yuan, Jingfu to 255 yuan, Xinhua to 280 yuan, and Qinxing to 200 yuan. Smaller and medium-sized stocks that are normally less active also rose slightly. However, near noon, faced with profit-taking from many parties, almost all stocks returned to low prices before closing. Among the less active stocks, Sino-French Business surged and showed strong resilience due to a surge in demand, while others were slightly affected. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yonghua Yarn, Meiya, Xinhua, and Qinxing all fell slightly. Jingfu maintained its own position, with many followers, and rose by half a percent alone. The announced asking price for the planned listing is said to be more than double the current price, which is also a strange phenomenon. Among the less active medium-sized and small stocks, Sino-French rose by half a percent, while the rest saw slight declines. Senior stocks were balanced and stable. Business continued to advance.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks saw a sudden drop, and securities firms took profits. Yishui retreated from 10,600 yuan to 9,600 yuan, and British United dropped from 12,600 yuan to 11,300 yuan. Other stocks followed suit, becoming weak. As a result, compared to the previous close, Hutchison Whampoa saw only a slight decline, while Yishui Beer, Yishui Yarn, and Yeguang all fell by about half a percent. British United, Asia Paper, and Kangye all fell by about ten percent.</p>
<h3>Asian Cotton Spinning Market · Japan Remains a Formidable Competitor</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] According to a report from the International Textile Company, one-fifth of Japan's cotton textile production capacity and one-third of its rayon production capacity still exist. Although 70% to 80% of the 12,300,000 spindles that existed in 1939 have been destroyed, four major textile machinery manufacturers still had a production capacity of 800,000 spindles and 16,000 to 17,000 textile machines in 1947. The products they produced in 1946 have not yet been calculated. At the end of the war, Japan's potential rayon production capacity reached 354,000,000 pounds, but due to a lack of raw materials, its production has been reduced to 13,000,000 pounds. The U.S. Department of Agriculture commented that Japan's textile labor force still exists, and if it can obtain a sufficient supply of raw cotton, Japan will be able to compete with China and India in the Asian market.</p>
<h3>Credit Still Not Easing · Gold and Banknotes Stable and Unchanged</h3>
<p>The black market rate was stable with little change yesterday, opening around 2.05 million. After the opening, sentiment was still good, and there was no shortage of buyers when prices were low, rising from 2.048 million to 2.058 million. The Central Bank continued to exert pressure, once falling back to 2.045 million, then hovering around 2.05 million. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 182 bars at a price of 2.055 million. After that, it became even more mediocre, remaining above 2.05 million until noon. It was closed in the afternoon. Suddenly, due to extremely tight credit conditions, it was forced down by many profit-takers, falling back to 2.04 million. The next-day settlement was still pulled up to over 2.05 million. As a result, it closed slightly higher than the previous close. Decorative gold, silver bullion, and silver dollars were all flat. The underground interest rate was initially flat, then tightened, with underground interest rates ranging from 17% to 20%.</p>
<p>The foreign currency market was very stable. U.S. dollars opened at 3,290 yuan to 3,310 yuan. They once rose slightly to around 3,315 yuan in the middle of the day. They were still hovering around the 3,300 yuan mark at noon. They then followed the gold market back to below 3,280 yuan, and finally remained flat. As a result, they closed 20 yuan lower than the previous close. Hong Kong dollars rebounded from 690 yuan to around 710 yuan, and finally remained within the 700 yuan range. As a result, they also fell slightly by 5 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was the same as the Hong Kong currency. Indian Rupees were offered at 840 yuan, and British Pounds at 11,200 yuan, with few transactions. U.S. dollars were slightly traded at a slight discount below the listed price.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Thousand-Fold Payment Deposits · Mr. Wang Xiaolai Issues Written Statement</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Xiaolai, member of the National Council of Political Affairs and Director of the Preparatory Committee of the National Federation of Commerce, issued a written statement yesterday regarding the court's ruling on the thousand-fold payment deposit case, saying, "I have just returned from the Northeast, where I was inspecting industry and commerce and providing comfort and relief to our compatriots, and preparing for the National Federation of Commerce. I was just about to publish my impressions of the Northeast when I was asked by reporters for my opinion on the court's ruling on the thousand-fold payment deposit case. I initially declined, saying that I had just unpacked and had not yet studied it in detail. Now, after reviewing the reports in various newspapers, I have the following observations, as their impact is significant."</p>
<p>(1) The Supplementary Regulations on Civil Procedure in Extraordinary Times, promulgated and implemented on July 1, 1941, have become invalid due to the Regulations on Handling Civil Procedure After Reconstruction, promulgated and implemented on December 18, 1945. Therefore, the Judicial Yuan's Interpretation No. 2885, which was based on the now-invalid regulations, and the Judicial Yuan's response to the Executive Yuan on November 21, 1945, No. 3018, are also invalid.</p>
<p>(2) The object of the current Supplementary Regulations, judging from its various provisions, seems to be the occupied areas, because the courts in those areas were unable to exercise their functions and lawsuits could not proceed. This regulation was established to remedy the injustice in society.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the provision of Article 12 of the current Supplementary Regulations, "If, after the establishment of a legal act, the circumstances change due to reasons not attributable to the parties, which could not have been foreseen at the time, and the original result is obviously unfair, the court shall fairly adjudicate to increase or decrease the payment or change other original effects," it seems that it should first be studied whether there is a regional limitation, because it seems inconsistent in terms of legislative technique.</p>
<p>(4) The legislation of the Republic of China under the Three Principles of the People, judging from the restriction on interest rates and the restriction on inheritance and renunciation of inheritance in the Civil Code, where the spirit and wording lean towards, is clear and does not need to be elaborated. The legislative intent of the aforementioned Article 12 can also be inferred.</p>
<p>(5) As for the circumstances, they should have a scope, and it seems acceptable to say that the devaluation of currency is also a change in circumstances. But where will the special laws regarding currency be placed?</p>
<p>(6) The so-called parties, creditors, and debtors, should all be included. Even if the devaluation of currency is a change in circumstances, this change is common sense and could have been foreseen at the time, but there was no power to resist it, unless one did not love the country and nation and exchanged it for foreign currency, storing it abroad, or setting up materials and houses in the country. Who can predict the reliability and unreliability of these?</p>
<p>(7) In a speculative gambling arena, there are those who release one cent for overseas, that is, one cent per day per yuan, which is 36 yuan per year, and even in ten years it is only 360 yuan. It seems too unfair to have to return 1,000 yuan for one yuan in less than ten years.</p>
<p>(8) If one yuan is not used as one yuan, then in the past when money and foreign currency were used together, those who borrowed foreign currency clearly wrote on the IOU that they borrowed foreign currency and would repay foreign currency, which seems to be much more sophisticated than the gold clause that was later canceled in the United States. Moreover, if currency loses its unified and unchanging nature, how can transactions succeed, and how can drafts, promissory notes, deposits, and loans be realized?</p>
<p>(9) How China's monetary system will be reformed in the future is currently very difficult to predict, but it will definitely not be like Germany and Britain after World War I, restoring the gold standard, because managing currency is in line with Sun Yat-sen's monetary revolution.</p>
<p>(10) This article concerns economic provisions. If loans must be increased, then farmers, industry, and commerce will all go bankrupt. I dare say that these people are all debtors, which is certainly not the original legislative intent of the Supplementary Regulations.</p>
<h3>Purchasing Raw Silk · Initially Based on 10,000 Dan</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The government's order to purchase raw silk and send it to Shanghai has been recorded in previous newspapers. It is now known that the China Trust Bureau, the Central Bank, and the Bank of China have been discussing detailed measures for days. It is reported that the principle has been determined to purchase 10,000 dan of superior raw silk, with a purchase price of 3.8 million yuan per dan. Detailed procedures will be announced in the near future.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and Agricultural Bank Jointly Establish Agricultural Machinery Company · Kong Xiangxi Serves as Chairman</h3>
<p>In order to improve agriculture in our country and increase production, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Farmers Bank have jointly initiated the establishment of the China Agricultural Machinery Company. The company's machinery and equipment will utilize the agricultural machinery allocated by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), and technical assistance will also be provided by UNRRA. The company has now been formally established, with Kong Xiangxi, Chairman of the Bank of China, serving as Chairman, and Zhou Yichun, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, serving as Vice Chairman. Li Shuming, General Manager of the Farmers Bank, Qian Tianhe, Vice Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Shen Xirui, Deputy Director of the Central Trust Bureau, and Wu Rencang and Pan Guangjiong serve as Managing Directors. Zhi Bingyuan has been hired as General Manager. The capital is set at 400 million yuan. The company will also establish several agricultural machinery factories, distributed throughout the country. It has been decided that the main factory will be located in Shanghai, and branch factories will be established in 18 locations, including Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Nanjing. The site of the main factory is located in Jungong Road, and the factory buildings have begun to be renovated. It is expected to start operations next month, initially manufacturing simple farm implements to meet rural needs, and selling them to farmers at low prices.</p>
<h3>Tianjin, Hankou, Sichuan, Hunan, and Other Merchants Search for Bleaching Powder and Bleaching Powder Essence</h3>
<p>Bleaching powder and bleaching powder essence prices had previously plummeted due to the abundance of arrivals in the Shanghai market. For example, a small bucket of bleaching powder essence weighing 100 catties had once reached a price of 630,000 to 640,000 yuan per bucket, but two weeks ago the price had returned to 120,000 yuan per bucket. Those holding large quantities of orders were also forced to sell at a loss of 80,000 yuan per bucket. Bleaching powder was even more miserable, with prices falling from over 300 yuan per pound to 120 yuan, which was actually cheaper than lime in Shanghai. This prompted merchants from Tianjin, Hankou, Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and other regions to buy up the goods. Recently, prices have been rising gradually due to the strong purchasing efforts. According to industry insiders, the import cost of bleaching powder essence is approximately 170,000 to 180,000 yuan per bucket, so it will be difficult for prices to fall in the future. Merchants from outside Shanghai mostly specify brands when purchasing goods. For example, bleaching powder essence must be the German "Ili Dun," and caustic soda must be the British "Moon" brand. American goods are generally not preferred. However, almost all goods on the market now are American goods because many factories in Shanghai have switched to using American goods. Therefore, it seems that out-of-town merchants' prejudices against brands have diminished.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Suggests Simplifying Banknote Designs · Aiming to Make Them Easier to Identify and More Difficult to Counterfeit</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly received reports from various industry associations in this city: Recently, counterfeit banknotes have been found on the market from time to time, and even a moment of carelessness can result in loss. Now, the Import and Export Chamber of Commerce has also sent a letter stating that they have also discovered similar incidents, although the losses are still minor, but there is concern that they may escalate over time. To prevent future troubles, please formulate comprehensive measures to eliminate unnecessary losses for both payers and receivers. The Chamber of Commerce submitted this to the Standing Committee meeting, which resolved that the current variety of banknote designs, with different sizes, makes it difficult for users to distinguish them, affecting the promotion of legal tender. They have sent a letter to the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank, requesting that the design of banknotes issued in the future be simplified and standardized in order to reduce the chances of counterfeiters succeeding and to make it easier for users to identify them.</p>

<h3>On the Zhoushan Archipelago · Third-Class Naval Port · First-Class Fishing Ground</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng, Dinghai, August 24</p>
<p>Dinghai is the main island of the Zhoushan Archipelago. All 185 islands are under the jurisdiction of Dinghai. It is located in the southeastern sea of China, the closest part of Zhejiang to Japan, and the gateway to the southeastern coast of our country, the maritime fortress of the entire nation. During the late Qing Dynasty, Germans were hired as consultants to design and build the navy, making Dinghai a naval base. Many forts were built, scattered across various important islands. During the Opium War, Dinghai was occupied by the British army. Later, after repeated negotiations by the Qing government, Hong Kong was exchanged, and the British finally left. Before leaving, they took the gun bolts, rendering the defensive artillery ineffective. All the way until the start of the Anti-Japanese War, when the enemy invaded Dinghai, these many cannons were not used. After the enemy occupied it, they melted down the iron cannons to cast other types of guns and cannons. The old base still exists today, making people feel extremely ashamed.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Measures in Dinghai · Countless Thoughts</h3>
<p>The Japanese valued the Zhoushan Archipelago highly, so they built roads to connect the entire territory, built shipyards to repair warships, excavated soil, arranged naval docks, installed steel pipes to transport fresh water to the sea, stored military supplies, increased military equipment, and occupied civilian land to open an airfield with an area of 1,600 mu. They also deployed a strong sea and air defense base on Siqiao Island, because Siqiao Island is a necessary sea and air route. A repair factory was also set up on the island, and several amphibious aircraft were often stationed at the airport, with a large number of torpedoes and suicide boats prepared, intending to fight a desperate battle on this sea and air island.</p>
<p>According to local people, "Japanese warships were often anchored in the port when the Japanese were present." These large warships were about 3,000 tons, because the draft could not be too deep. Now, according to the navy, "Only a few warships of more than 500 tons, and many gunboats, have been received. The gunboats have a displacement of only 25 tons and are used to launch torpedoes. There are also 60 suicide boats, and a lot of other food, ammunition, weapons, and equipment." The suicide boats are now piled on one side of the airfield. These suicide boats have very small bodies and very large bows. The explosives are stored in the bow. They advance at a very fast speed, driven by one person. If they encounter a warship, they rush towards the ship regardless of everything, inevitably resulting in mutual destruction. Inside the airfield, there are three seaplanes scattered, but no one is using them, allowing them to rot. In view of all the enemy's facilities in Dinghai, we have countless thoughts. Here, we are glad that the enemy surrendered unconditionally earlier, otherwise Dinghai would have been reduced to ashes in the enemy's desperate battle. We are glad that the enemy did not destroy anything in Dinghai, but instead made military construction in Dinghai.</p>
<h3>Chinese Young and Strong Air Force</h3>
<p>During the arduous and lengthy eight years of the War of Resistance, no one can deny the merits of the Air Force. These airborne heroes not only displayed unparalleled bravery in their duties, eliminating tenacious enemy bandits, but also won back considerable honor abroad. No one believed that flying Stearman training planes could cross the Hump, but our Air Force safely arrived in China; no one believed that the young Chinese Air Force could perform formation flying with letter formations, but we accomplished the most difficult letter formation. No one believed it was possible to fly to Japan, with its solid air defenses, to fight, but we flew across the ocean and delivered humanitarian bombs. Their footprints reached as far as India, Britain, and the United States. Their perseverance was enough to amaze and surprise allied nations, and to inspire admiration and awe in the enemy!</p>
<p>They can't forget the cradle of the Chinese Air Force – Jianqiao in Hangzhou. Therefore, every time the "September 1st" anniversary of the academy is celebrated, even if they are far away, they must have a fervent celebration.</p>
<p>Now that the War of Resistance has been won, they have returned to their alma mater's base. This cradle of the Chinese Air Force, which made a huge contribution to the War of Resistance, should be the most revered sacred place in the hearts of all our people.</p>
<p>The following pictures show how the Chinese Air Force grew from adolescence to adulthood during the arduous and lengthy eight years? Chu Yusheng.</p>

<h3>Defensive and Offensive: The Best Third-Class Naval Port</h3>
<p>Naval Captain Yang Daozhao, the special commissioner stationed in Dinghai, told me, "With equipment like that in Dinghai, it can only be said to be an important naval port, not quite a naval base. However, the enemy's intention was to use this place as a naval base, because the entrance here has islands as a barrier, and the harbor is calm and tranquil, making it defensive and offensive. It's indeed the best third-class naval port."</p>
<p>Naval Major Xu Kuizhao, the chief of staff, was also beside me. He said to me, "The enemy prepared to attack from here, and only defend when absolutely necessary, as can be seen from their preparations for suicide boats, torpedoes, and gunboats. At the same time, the main island of Zhoushan, Dinghai, is surrounded by small islands, making the terrain treacherous, the sea passages winding, allowing for concealment. If large warships are encountered, they can hide near the small islands after attacking, making it difficult for the large ships to counterattack."</p>
<p>I know that US Army General Kirk has been here. He praised the terrain here very much, saying that Dinghai is actually the outpost of Xiangshan Port, and its importance exceeds that of Xiangshan Port. We feel immense interest in this Dinghai, which is rich in military value; Dinghai City is built on the main island of Da Zhoushan, surrounded by fertile fields, small hills, and trickling streams. The streets in the city are clean, and although the buildings of the shops are old-fashioned, they are also very neat, quiet, and free from hustle and bustle. There are 420,000 people on these 185 islands, half of whom are engaged in fishing.</p>
<h3>Large Fishing Grounds and Cold Storage Plants: Fish Production Around 6 Million Dan</h3>
<p>Dinghai is also one of China's three major fishing grounds, namely the South China Sea fishing ground of Hainan Island, the Yantai fishing ground of the Yellow and Bohai Seas, and the Dinghai fishing ground of the Zhoushan Islands. Dinghai's fishing industry has four major types: large yellow croaker fishing, small yellow croaker fishing, ribbonfish fishing, and cuttlefish fishing. The Zhejiang Provincial Government has specially set up a Fisheries Bureau here, sending Rao Yongbi as the director, to manage the fisheries of the 22 counties along the Zhejiang coast, with a coastline of more than 600 nautical miles. Dinghai's fish production alone is more than 6 million dan per year, with more than 30,000 fishing boats. When we came here, it was the cold season, and most of the fishing boats had gone to carry passengers and goods, and there were still some fishing boats moored on the coast of Dinghai, with masts standing in forest formation.</p>
<p>I visited the cold storage plant, which is for cold storage of fresh fish for fear of spoilage. The plant is divided into separate cold storage rooms. After the fish are caught from the sea, the abdomen is cut open and the intestines are removed, and then they are placed in the cold storage room. They are lined up on freezing pans, allowed to freeze, and then placed in cold air rooms to keep them at the lowest temperature so that they do not melt, and then cut into strips of frozen fish that can be sold or transported outside.</p>
<p>Most of the fishermen are poor. Therefore, the fish market lends money to the fishermen, or the fish wharf lends money to the fishermen. When the fishing season is harvested, they must still sell all the fish to the lending fish market, which then buys them at a low price. The fishermen can only sell them with pain and tears. There are also fish factories that transform fish into salted or dried products themselves, and they also lend money to fish markets, which in turn lend money to fishermen, or lend directly to fishermen. Then, the fish market lends money to ice-fresh boats, and the ice-fresh boats lend money to fishermen. After the fishing season, the boats collect fish from the fishermen and sell them to the fish markets. These fish markets all have commissions to collect, and all exploit the fishermen. This is also an old habit from hundreds and thousands of years ago, and the fishing methods are also old methods from hundreds and thousands of years ago. The fish markets only know how to make commissions and high-interest loans, and do not know how to improve the methods. The fishermen, in a situation where they are struggling to make a living, can only stick to the rules.</p>
<h3>Poor Fishing Season, Expensive Ice and Salt: Anxious and Nowhere to Go</h3>
<p>We went to Shenjiamen, a prosperous area of the fish market, for investigation. According to acquaintances, the fishing boats on both sides were full during the fishing season, and even ships could hardly pass through. Ashore, we saw that the buildings on both sides of the street were very neat, and there were also Western-style buildings. The streets were relatively wide, but our noses were filled with the fishy smell and a mixed stench of human urine and sewage.</p>
<p>There are more than 80 fish markets here. This year, due to a strong wind, no fish were caught, which has not happened in 20 years. The money lent out by the fish markets cannot be recovered, so they are crying out for help to rescue the fishermen.</p>
<p>This year, the price of ice is high, the highest is 50,000 yuan per dan, and the price of salt is also high, more than 7,000 yuan per dan. The high price of ice affects the ice-fresh boats, and the high price of salt affects the lives of fishermen. Moreover, the sea is not peaceful, and people often ask for "passage money" or extort "protection fees." The poor fishermen fish like they are stealing fish, and if they don't fish, they can't pay back their debts. The fishing season this spring was bad, and the fishermen are even more anxious and have nowhere to go.</p>
<h3>The Zhejiang Fisheries Bureau Has Just Been Established: New Topics Should Be Worked Hard</h3>
<p>Most of the fishermen's fishing boats are not their own. They also rent them from others and return them to the lessors for repairs after the fishing season. The boat rental is certainly not low. I heard that the rental for a boat is 40 dan of rice. Therefore, a fish goes through many processes and is exploited a lot from the time it is caught to the time it is eaten.</p>
<p>After the grand fishing season, the fishermen get a little money, because of the resentment in their hearts, they drink and gamble heavily, and some even go whoring. They just want to have a good time. It's really "live for today, for tomorrow we die"! Nine out of ten fishermen are illiterate, and those who are literate do not become fishermen. They are well-dressed and are the "spokespersons" for the fishermen.</p>
<p>Now, the Zhejiang Provincial Fisheries Bureau has just been established. How to improve the lives of fishermen? How to improve fishing methods? How to reduce the exploitation of middlemen? How to protect the safety of fishermen? These are all topics that they will work hard on in the future.</p>
<p>The Zhoushan Islands, a good naval port and a large fishing ground in China, are facing difficulties, and we hope to be able to solve them so that this series of islands along our coast can exert their strength! (Written on the boat to Putuo)</p>

<p>Car Deaths Should Have a Special Chapter</p>
<p>Dear Editor: Since the victory in Shanghai, car deaths have become increasingly rampant. I hereby write to the Shanghai Municipal Government regarding this matter, and would appreciate it if you could publish it. (Omitted above) It has been found that the number of car accidents in Shanghai is gradually increasing. Since the collision between a US military vehicle and a car, which resulted in the death of Mr. Chen; subsequently, cars have crashed into tram stations or into walls. These are just the most shocking examples. Countless rickshaws, pedicabs, and pedestrians have been hit by cars, resulting in severed heads, broken arms, and splattered brains. The number of accidents can accumulate to three to five times a day, and the death of Ms. Cheng Dingjun, the widow of martyr Zhang Yongchun, the former secretary of the Party Committee, and her second son, Zhang Pingsun, is particularly tragic. If a person is hit by a car because they are lingering in the middle of the road in an area with heavy traffic, it can be attributed to their own fault. However, if a person is walking on the sidewalk and is also met with tragedy, then there is no other way to avoid disaster other than to stay at home all day long. Pedestrians, no matter where they are walking, and no matter what vehicle they are riding, are in a precarious situation, with danger at every turn. In my opinion, even if traffic regulations are well-organized in the future, it is still impossible to guarantee that cars will not cause accidents. Considering that Principal Cheng was killed in an area that was not particularly congested, it seems that separate regulations should be made regarding the elimination of car accidents. I will now present my humble opinions in separate articles: (1) Investigate the nature of the car causing the accident in detail to determine the method of negotiation. The police station has records of which organization the car belongs to, but according to newspaper reports, most of them are US military, National Army, and UNRRA vehicles. It is proposed to conduct strict negotiations to ensure that they comply with the regulations and avoid causing accidents. (2) Limit the speed of travel and prescribe a penalty for violations to prevent accidents. The cause of car accidents is mostly due to excessive speed, and the type of vehicle is mostly jeeps. Jeeps are originally military vehicles of the Allied forces, equipped with the best machines, and are extremely agile when driving on the battlefield. However, what is the need to open the throttle and drive straight ahead at this time and place? It is proposed to clearly prescribe the speed of travel and prescribe a penalty for violations, and instruct the police station to strictly crack down on violations. The speed should be reduced at night and on roads with sparse traffic to avoid accidents. (3) Prohibit ten-wheeled trucks from driving in the city center. Ten-wheeled trucks were originally tools for transporting goods on highways in foreign countries, and should not be allowed to pass through the city. Moreover, the streets of Shanghai are narrow and congested, and it is easy to cause accidents when driving in them. It is proposed to find a way to prohibit them to ensure safety. (4) Conduct strict screening of drivers of special agencies in a uniform manner to ensure caution. Whether the Chinese, Russian, and drivers hired by the US military and UNRRA, and the drivers of military agencies, have been issued driver's licenses by the police station in accordance with the regulations, and whether they are under the management of the police station, cannot be known. However, since they are rushing around, killing people like flies, measures should be taken to crack down on them. It is proposed to instruct the police station to conduct strict screening in a uniform manner, and to give them earnest warnings when issuing licenses, so as to ensure that they act with caution and avoid causing accidents. (5) Strictly prohibit overtaking to maintain order. Before the War of Resistance, the patrolmen in the concessions strictly prohibited cars from overtaking. Not only was the order well-maintained, but there were also fewer accidents. Now, cars are driving in the road, vying to be first, and the order is chaotic, resulting in injuries and collisions. It is proposed to strictly prohibit this. (6) Crack down on hit-and-run cars: Cars in Shanghai often do not stop to rescue the person who was hit after causing an accident, but instead open the throttle and flee, resulting in panic and injury to several people. If this situation is not effectively curbed, then what will become of the safety of pedestrians? It is proposed to instruct the police station that if a hit-and-run car is encountered in the future and refuses to stop, a warning shot should be fired immediately. If the driver still refuses to comply, the tires should be shot out. At the same time, this method should be communicated to the US military and the National Army headquarters, requesting them to pass on the message to all drivers. (7) Strictly punish the drivers who cause the accidents to serve as a warning: There were not many car accidents in the era of concessions. The punishment for drivers who injured pedestrians was only a fine. Now, the number of accidents is high and fierce. The tragedy on Bixun Road this time resulted in two deaths, plunging the family of martyr Zhang Yongchun into a desperate situation, and leaving orphans without support. Such a vicious driver, even the death penalty is not enough to cover his crime. How can a small fine be enough to settle the matter? It is proposed that in the future, the police station should file a public prosecution with the court for negligent homicide against the drivers who cause the accidents, depending on the severity of the circumstances, to punish them and to serve as a warning. (8) The municipal government should jointly launch a safety campaign with the municipal party committee, hang slogans in the streets, and print leaflets in Chinese and English to advise drivers, or add illustrations, and distribute them to drivers by the patrol police to raise awareness. The above is only a general overview. The municipal government has the authority to decide how to formulate the regulations in detail, which is beyond the ability of citizens to do. Now, the car killings are still continuing. If we do not act quickly to prevent them, then who can stay at home and feel safe? Please convene a meeting urgently and implement these measures immediately. Even if they cannot be completely eliminated, they should be reduced considerably. (Ding Ruihou)</p>
<h3>Worry-Free Drinking Water in the Western District</h3>
<p>On August 23rd, the Reader's Opinions column of your newspaper published a section about citizen Zhao Yongnian et al. requesting the installation of a free tap water outlet in Meijiaqiao Lane, Zhuanbang, Jiangsu Road. It has been found that the water pipes laid in the Tingsu Road area are of small diameter and have insufficient water pressure, making it difficult to get water. If more taps are installed, it will be even more affected. Therefore, it is difficult to install them in the area at present. However, in order to take care of the drinking water of the poor, the Bureau has now notified the Shanghai Water Company to open three fire hydrants free of charge for emergency needs: (1) Zhuanbang, Jiangsu Road East, (2) Middle Zheng West Road (between Dihua Road and Jiangsu Road), (3) near Yugu Village, Jing'an Temple Road. Please publish this to let everyone know. (Public Utilities Bureau, August 31)</p>

<h3>Judgment on Japanese War Criminal Takashi Sakai Continued from page 9 of yesterday's newspaper</h3>
<p>Also, John Allerdice Dugan, a lieutenant in the artillery and a member of the Allied Southeast Asia Command's 43rd Cemetery Registration Group stationed in Hong Kong, excavated dozens of corpses of murdered prisoners of war in cemeteries in Stanley, Wong Nai Chung Gap, Repulse Bay, and other places in Hong Kong. In addition, rusted iron wires that had been used as handcuffs were found in the piles of remains, and photos were taken as evidence. Furthermore, Mrs. Zhao Shujia, the wife of Zou Lu, and Mrs. Cheng Muzhen, the wife of Zou Yue, who were present at the scene, went to court and described the atrocities they witnessed at the time in vivid detail. In addition to the testimony of witness Qiu Riren, who clearly proved that the troops under the defendant's command committed acts of abuse, rape, and plunder in the Kowloon area, as well as the cruel act of releasing dogs to bite people, there is also a report from Rafael R.M. Lavale, the representative of the Argentine Consulate in Hong Kong, which can be used as corroborating evidence.</p>
<p>Regarding the robbery of our country's treasured books, there is also a letter from the National Peking Library that can be used as evidence. In summary, the defendant's implementation of the war of aggression in North China and Hong Kong and Guangdong, and the wanton acts of the troops, are clearly proven and undeniable. Although the reasons he gave for his defense are as follows: (1) He said that the request to withdraw the troops stationed in Hebei and to dismiss the head of the Hebei administration was based on the Boxer Protocol. (2) He said that he participated in the war on the orders of the Japanese government. (3) He said that he was not aware of the atrocities of his subordinates, so how could he be responsible? However, regarding the first point, the Boxer Protocol does not prohibit our country from stationing troops in Hebei Province, nor does it give Japan the right to demand the dismissal of the head of the Hebei administration. As for the fourth paragraph of the Tianjin Exchange of Notes attached to the protocol, it only sets a limit of 20 li between the places where the Chinese and Japanese troops are stationed in Tianjin in order to avoid conflicts between the Chinese and Japanese troops. The defendant actually used this article to claim that Japan had the right to demand that our country withdraw the troops stationed in Hebei and dismiss the head of the Hebei administration, which is a deliberate distortion. Regarding the second point, a war of aggression is an act of destroying international peace, and even if the defendant participated in it on orders, he cannot shirk his responsibility. Moreover, during the war, the troops committed wanton acts, which is a violation of international laws of war. How can he excuse himself by citing government orders in the hope of being relieved of responsibility? Regarding the third point, according to international practice, the commander of the war has the responsibility to strictly supervise and control the actions of his subordinates. The defendant's negligence in supervising the actions of his subordinates and neglect of his supervisory responsibilities is already difficult to excuse. Moreover, he supervised the war in Hong Kong and Guangdong for nearly two years, and the atrocities of his troops spread throughout the Southeast. It is even more unreasonable to say that he has heard nothing about it. Moreover, according to the confession of his captured subordinate, Colonel Kinzuke Noma: "We were originally limited to two days to capture Hong Kong, but because the advance of the army was slow, it took eight days, and we were severely reprimanded. Lieutenant General Sakai must have known all the atrocities of the Japanese army," as well as the sworn statement of Stanley Martin Banfill, a captain medical officer in the Canadian Army Medical Corps stationed in Hong Kong: "A Japanese officer named Honda, who was proficient in English, stated in person that military orders were like mountains, and all prisoners of war must be killed." And the defendant's admission during the trial that he knew at the time that his troops had killed prisoners of war in St. Stephen's Hospital, it is sufficient to show that the defendant knew about and condoned the atrocities of his subordinates. The large-scale massacre on Hong Kong Island was due to the fact that it took eight days of siege to land, and the accumulated anger was difficult to dissipate, so he did not hesitate to do this to show revenge, which is also clear. What else is there to hide? All of his defenses are nothing more than cunning attempts to shirk responsibility, and are not acceptable at all. To respect the independence, sovereignty, and territorial and administrative integrity of China is clearly stipulated in Article 1 of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. And to condemn war as an instrument of national policy, Article 1 of the Pact of Paris clearly states. The defendant first incited treacherous parties to disrupt Tianjin and force us to withdraw our troops and dismiss administrative officials, and advocated the independence of the five provinces of North China. After leading his troops to fight in Xuzhou, Guangdong, he supported puppet troops and promoted the power of the puppet government, and always participated in the war of aggression, usurping our country's sovereignty and destroying our country's territorial and administrative integrity. It is clearly a violation of the above-mentioned international provisions and should be found guilty of disrupting peace. Therefore, he is punished by analogy with Article 101, Paragraph 1 of our country's Criminal Law, which deals with the crime of seizing national territory and usurping sovereignty by means of violence. As for his atrocities during the war, such as massacring prisoners of war, wounded soldiers, Red Cross doctors, nurses, and other non-combatants, as well as rape, robbery, deportation of civilians, abuse of torture, and destruction of property, are violations of Articles 4 to 7, 23 (3), 23 (7), 28, 46, and 47 of the Hague Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, and Articles 1 to 6, 9, and 10 of the Geneva Convention. Although there are corresponding provisions in our country's Criminal Law that can be used for analogy, the defendant repeatedly knew about and condoned the atrocities of his subordinates, intending to establish prestige by abuse and conquer the people to achieve the purpose of his war of aggression. His general criminal intent is very obvious. All the atrocities of killing, raping, and plundering are just manifestations of his entire wanton behavior, that is, the realization of his general criminal intent. Based on the principles of the concurrence of laws and the superiority of special law over general law, all kinds of atrocities should be summarized and punished by analogy with the provisions of Article 34 of the Criminal Law of the Army, Navy, and Air Force regarding the crime of wanton behavior. Moreover, the defendant disrupted peace and participated in the war of aggression, thereby violating humanitarian and war regulations. The crimes are related in terms of method and result, and should be punished with the more serious punishment. The defendant deliberately engaged in aggressive work, repeatedly using insidious means to collude and provoke, causing the July 7th Incident at Lugou Bridge, which led to this World War. It has become an unprecedented catastrophe in history, which is a violation of international justice and a destruction of world peace. Moreover, during the war, he trampled on Hong Kong and Guangdong, and wherever the weapons went, the people were devastated and the villages were turned into ruins. In particular, the cruel methods of disembowelment, gouging out eyes, slicing, and cutting up corpses were applied to prisoners of war, disabled soldiers, rescue workers, and innocent civilians, which is even more tragic and is the scourge of mankind and the enemy of civilization. He should be sentenced to the most severe punishment to show deterrence.</p>
<p>Based on the above conclusions, the judgment shall be made in accordance with Articles 1 and 8 of the War Criminals Trial Regulations, the first paragraph of Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 1 of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, Article 1 of the Pact of Paris, Articles 4 to 7, 23 (3), 23 (7), 28, 46, and 47 of the Hague Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, Articles 1 to 6, 9, and 10 of the Geneva Convention, Article 34 of the Criminal Law of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, Article 101 (1) of the Criminal Law, and Article 55 of the Criminal Law. The prosecutor of this court, Chen Guang, performed his duties in court.</p>

<h3>World Aviation Hub: Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Our Hong Kong Air News on the 24th, Special Correspondent Ling Fang</p>
<p>According to Reuters, British Airways' airship "Hamilton" is scheduled to depart from London's Poole Airport on August 24th, carrying 16 passengers on an 8,352-mile flight to Hong Kong in four days. This marks the opening of the company's Far East "Dragon Line." Subsequently, there will be one flight per week, directly from England to Hong Kong. Soon, an additional flight per week will be added, and the route will extend from Hong Kong to Shanghai, with its final destination being Tokyo.</p>
<p>The Important Position of the Dragon Line</p>
<p>After the war, the "Dragon Line" of this American airline was the beginning of formal scheduled air routes between Hong Kong and various parts of Europe and the United States. After the British army re-entered Hong Kong, they took Kai Tak Airport back from the Japanese army and started to develop Ping Shan Airport, planning to establish a world aviation hub in Hong Kong. After three years of operation by the Japanese, Kai Tak Airport had 3,000 civilian houses in Kowloon City demolished to build two runways, each 2,000 yards long, in a cross shape, sufficient for the take-off and landing of four-engine giant transport aircraft (before the war, there was only one runway of 800 yards), but it was not enough to accommodate the latest giant mail planes. Therefore, the British authorities decided to choose the rural area of Ping Shan in the New Territories to rebuild a large airport with runways 5,000 yards long. However, the villagers of Ping Shan were determined to oppose it, resulting in the internationally shocking Ping Shan Airport incident. The British government announced its abandonment of construction in April of this year. The British had built an airport in Kam Tin in the New Territories before the war, but it was limited by the terrain and could not be expanded. It is said that another location has now been selected, preparing to build a large airport that meets the standards of modern international civil airports, with a construction cost of four million pounds, expected to be completed in 30 months. Due to funding and other relationships, the Hong Kong government and the British Colonial Office are still discussing it, and it is currently impossible to announce when construction will begin. The location of the new airport is also kept secret by the Hong Kong government, but it is probably within the New Territories leased from Baoan County in our country.</p>
<p>An Amphibious Airport</p>
<p>Before the construction of a standard large airport, Kai Tak Airport can still take on the current responsibility of Hong Kong's air harbor. According to an experienced pilot, Kai Tak Airport is comparable to Shanghai's Jiangwan Airport and surpasses Guangzhou's Tianhe Airport. Kai Tak Airport, with Lion Rock on one side and Kowloon Bay on the other, is an amphibious, well-equipped aviation station, which is beyond the reach of ordinary airports that only serve land-based aircraft.</p>
<p>The Equipment of the Hamilton</p>
<p>British Overseas Airways Corporation's London-Hong Kong route uses airship flights. The "Hamilton," which is departing for Hong Kong today, is equipped with four engines, weighs 55,000 pounds, carries 16 passengers, and has a crew of six. It has a speed of 170 miles per hour. The interior has 16 beds and 16 sofa chairs, divided into four rooms. The upper floor has another room with a bar, dining room, kitchen, and toilets, with a modern layout and convenient supplies. It departs from Hong Kong every Wednesday, with a one-way ticket price of £170 and a round-trip ticket price of £306. The freight rate is 17 shillings per kilogram. Excess baggage costs £1 14s per kilogram. Transportation between London and Hong Kong will be even closer. Before the war, British Overseas Airways Corporation's Far East route was mainly the England-Australia route, with a Singapore-Hong Kong branch line built for connection. Therefore, this direct flight between London and Hong Kong can be considered the first in history.</p>
<p>Pan American's Statement</p>
<p>Before the war, in addition to British Overseas Airways Corporation, Pan American Airways also had a station in Hong Kong. On the day the Pacific War broke out, Pan American Airways' "Clipper Hawaii" became a victim of Japanese bombs on the side of the water station at Kai Tak Airport. Before the war, Pan American Airways' trans-Pacific route departed from San Francisco, via Honolulu, Midway Island, Wake Island, Guam, Manila, and to Hong Kong, taking six days for the entire journey. After the war, due to the lack of agreement on Anglo-American aviation rights, flights were delayed. Hong Kong mail to the United States is only transferred via England. In the past, there were rumors that the United States planned to set up a station in Macau to replace Hong Kong, but the US Consulate in Hong Kong has formally denied this news to reporters. Recently, Anglo-American Far East aviation rights seem to have reached a compromise. Pan American's staff in Hong Kong said a few days ago that aircraft will be dispatched to resume direct flights between Hong Kong and the United States within two months, but still waiting for the approval of the Civil Aeronautics Board in Washington.</p>
<p>It is said that Pan American Airways has divided the trans-Pacific route into north and south lines after the war. The northern route goes via Honolulu, Alaska, Tokyo, Shanghai, and to Hong Kong. The southern route goes via Honolulu to Australia, the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, Manila, and to Hong Kong. Pan American Airways has recently dispatched an aircraft from the United States across the Atlantic, via Europe, to India, officially opening the New Delhi line as a section of the global route. In the future, it will extend to Singapore, connecting the North Pacific or South Pacific line to complete the global flight, and Hong Kong will become one of the main communication stations on the global route.</p>
<p>Development of Hong Kong Air Routes</p>
<p>In addition to China, Central, British Overseas and Pan American Airways, Southwest Airlines, Philippine Far Eastern Shipping Company, and Asia Airlines will soon establish air routes in Hong Kong. (The Far East Shipping Company dispatched a "Sky Master" giant aircraft on the Philippine-Hong Kong maiden voyage today, safely arriving in Hong Kong, the entire journey costing only two hours.) The Manila-Hong Kong routes of the latter two companies have been unofficially open for many times. China Airlines is also interested in dispatching aircraft to open the Hong Kong-Singapore and Hong Kong-Calcutta routes. The Far East air network centered on Hong Kong has now been gradually completed. Chinese, British, and American aviation industries are bound to set off a fierce competition.</p>
<p>In order to adapt to this new environment, the Hong Kong government is scheduled to restore the Far East Aviation Training School attached to Kai Tak Airport next month, to cultivate aviation talents. The school was established several years before the war, and more than 100 Chinese students have graduated from it, most of whom are now serving in the domestic aviation industry. Most of the old staff of the school have returned to Hong Kong, and in the future, it will be renamed the Far East Aviation Training Academy, officially starting enrollment on September 1. The school's curriculum is divided into flight and mechanical classes. According to Mr. Qu, the chief engineer of the academy, at the beginning of the school's reopening, the instruments and various parts are not yet complete. It is planned to open the flight class first, and the mechanical class must wait for various equipment to arrive before resuming. The school has ordered three new training aircraft from England, which will be shipped to Hong Kong next month.</p>
<p>Planning to Build a Large Airport</p>
<p>Because of its superior geographical conditions, Hong Kong has been one of the world's major ports in the age of maritime transport. After the war, the age of aviation has begun. The Hong Kong government is catching up, planning to build a large airport that meets the standards, in an attempt to maintain its position in international transportation. Just as maritime transport requires deep-water harbors, air transport requires a vast base. Guangzhou cannot compete with Hong Kong in the former, but Hong Kong cannot compare with Guangzhou in the latter. After the war, international air routes mostly used land-based aircraft instead of seaplanes, and the American C69 giant land-based aircraft cannot land at the current Hong Kong airport. It is rumored that Pan American Airways has recently shifted its target to Guangzhou. Whether this is true remains to be proven. However, we must coordinate with the objective environment and intensify the rectification of Guangzhou's aviation facilities. This time, we must not let Hong Kong take the lead in aviation transportation!</p>

<h3>Evidence of Guilt</h3>
<p>— Zheng Jia'ai</p>
<p>By Luo Binji, First Edition, August 35th Year</p>
<p>The first collection of literary works recently published by Minsheng Bookstore consists of ten books, one of which is Luo Binji's novella, entitled "Evidence of Guilt," with a total length of about 40,000 words.</p>
<p>After the victory, Luo was first familiar to Shanghai readers with his collection of short stories, "The Spring of Beiwangyuan"; his gentle, delicate, and very unique style was loved and imitated by many young people who loved literature and art. At the same time, the material was realistic and full of strong local characteristics, which was undoubtedly a precious harvest in the barren literary world. Compared with "The Spring of Beiwangyuan," "Evidence of Guilt" is much more serious in terms of content and style; although the latter lacks the warmth and fragrance of spring, it still allows us to smell some of the breath of spring, while "Evidence of Guilt" is like a heavy brand iron, pressing on our hearts; cold and heavy; those unpleasant nightmares are clearly reflected in front of us; in the disappointment after the victory, the past hatred, coupled with the crisis facing us, who can not tremble and fear? Many bloody killings have passed, and many lives and treasures have been lost cheaply; these seem to have just disappeared, and seem to have been long ago; but it is definitely not a dream. In the sounds that humans can hear, we finally hear the most miserable delirium, which is caused by oppression and threat, the delirium of warriors; they are still trapped in their own dark houses, constantly defending, begging for forgiveness, and roaring; they have never committed a crime, but they are punished more cruelly than the death penalty; the protagonist in "Evidence of Guilt" is encountered like this:</p>
<p>In the spring of 1931, Wu Zhan Kui graduated from a senior high school in the North, with a passionate thirst for knowledge, as well as the hope of life in a big city. He was admitted to the Faculty of Law of Peking University. At school, he was not interested in politics and never had any activities. He took his books on time every day to attend lectures in the classroom. During holidays or spare time, he often went to the theater to listen to Peking Opera. After the show, he often sighed, which was an expression of his inner praise and happiness. This winter, he planned to go to his hometown outside the Guan to spend his holidays. "He felt light-hearted for the first time, and saw the endless snowfield under the winter sky for the first time. Those grass branches with the tips of the wooden handles exposed, those cold sparrows flying low on the snow, thinking of the passage of time, thinking of being away from home for a year, the days of being a guest in a foreign country, thinking of the little friends in his hometown, I am afraid that they have changed with the years." Wu Zhan Kui smiled. He felt how he should work hard so as not to waste this precious youth... He did not begin to notice the influence of the Manchurian Incident on himself until he was processing his "entry certificate" (to enter Manchuria) in Tianjin; Puyi's return to the capital was not just something in writing. On the evening of arrival in Dalian, Wu Zhan Kui and eleven other intellectual youths had their "entry certificates" withheld, and they were interrogated by Chinese interpreters. Without proof of the facts, without room for defense, based only on the enemy's own suspicions, he was sent to prison with shackles added to his legs; in the five years, Wu Zhan Kui grew old and haggard: "His eyes showed great restlessness and emptiness. He no longer had academic desires, and also lost the arrogance of his youth. It seemed that he had no desire for anything in the world. He just paid attention to the light in the small window, to see if it was time to distribute the prisoners' rations, listening to the footsteps in the next room, listening to see if new prisoners were being locked in, or if old prisoners had the happiness of being interrogated. Occasionally, swallows flashed by, and he knew it was spring, but spring was so far away from him. Occasionally, a fallen leaf appeared in the courtyard, and he felt it was autumn, but autumn was so vague."... It was not until the day of the "Manchukuo King's" amnesty that he was suddenly released. At the moment he was released from prison, he was dizzy with the broad road, crowds, livestock, vehicles, green trees, bright lights, and the fiery sunset and the evening haze by the sea. After Wu Zhan Kui was taken back to his hometown of Hunchun by his sister Yu Fang, his mind was always dazed. All the friends he could remember had changed. His teacher, Li Hancheng, had become a rogue by smoking opium; his good friend Jin Liwu was also an opium addict: and he never stopped talking about business, always wanting to cooperate with the Japanese to make big money. His energy could no longer make him pay attention to these trivial matters. All he could hear clearly was what Jin Liwu said when he left: "Secret agents are secretly investigating you." Therefore, Wu Zhan Kui became confused in an instant. He could not stay at home in peace, nor could he sleep. He was completely mad, and his hands were tied with hemp ropes by his father and locked in the room. That night, Zhan Kui's father, Dapeng, hurried to the Korean area to collect soybeans, preparing to make more profit when Japan and Russia (Soviet Russia) went to war; but he lost his way and went to the Korean border. He was detained overnight and escorted by Japanese police the next day, and fell ill.</p>
<p>In the end, Wu Dapeng died, Zhan Kui went mad, and Yu Fang also stopped talking much. She always worked silently and depressed. They had never committed a crime. Where did the "evidence of guilt" come from to punish them? When I finished reading this book, I truly felt that the most desired thing for mankind is the word "truth"; when will fascism, and the demons similar to it, be eliminated? It killed innocent young people, making them neither dead nor alive, and suffered mental abuse and trauma; some people say: "Only crazy people are happy, they can laugh and cry without scruples." But the delirium and dull eyes of madmen clearly reveal eternal sorrow. Some people say: "Society is suitable for the survival of the not-too-strong and not-too-weak, and all mediocrities will not go mad or perish... Only madmen go to perish, because he is strong and weak, he is weak, but he thinks he is strong... It is said that most people who go mad now are young people." Therefore, we need to fight for the years that young people should enjoy, and they cannot be arbitrarily oppressed and driven mad!</p>
<p>In this novel, Luo Binji temporarily put away his delicate writing style, but still retained the characteristics of fluency and delicacy. He vividly portrays the psychology and actions of madmen. We can very likely imagine how a faithful literary artist, when he described those cruel facts with blood, tears, and indignation, passionately held the feeling of "accusation"; yes; he is "accusing," "accusing" this "trumped-up" "evidence of guilt."</p>
<h3>What is the Future of International Law?</h3>
<p>— Sun Hang</p>
<p>In the spring of 1942, while the whole world was still anxiously troubled by the war, some well-meaning people from the United States and Canada had already begun to discuss post-war reconstruction issues. They were a group of international law scholars, about two hundred in number, who held eighteen meetings successively in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington, San Francisco, and other places. The central question discussed was, "What should the future of international law be?"</p>
<p>After thorough and repeated discussions, they published a report as their common opinion. This report was edited into a book by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, entitled "The Future of International Law." Mr. Wu Zeyan of our country has translated it into Chinese, and it has been published by the Commercial Press.</p>
<p>In addition to the introduction and preface, this book is divided into three main parts. The first is the foundation of future international law, "which is the indispensable premise for establishing and maintaining an effective legal system in the international community." The second is the principles of future international law, which can be "a draft of a declaration on the future of international law." The third is the proposals for future international law, which are "some measures that can be adopted to implement the above principles."</p>
<p>The first two parts are relatively abstract and theoretical. Therefore, in terms of practical contributions to international law, the final proposal is undoubtedly more concrete and valuable.</p>
<p>The development of international law should be in line with the changes in the world situation. Sometimes, after mankind has suffered enough lessons and pain, they want to save themselves, and even want to create international law that can be used to obtain peace and security, in order to lead the changes in the world situation. Therefore, the development of international law not only depends on the development of international relations, but also needs to take human wisdom and needs as driving factors.</p>
<p>For this reason, international law should no longer be an involuntary product like customary law. It should be a man-made tool to help develop the future of mankind. If mankind wants to use international law to lead the world from war to peace, they must deliberately create international law, rather than recognize customary international practices.</p>
<p>This book is a kind of creation for international law. Its words are based on the standpoint of world peace and legal order. In some places, it is revolutionizing the existing international law; in some places, it is fundamentally establishing a new kind of international law.</p>
<p>(1) Revolutionizing Existing International Law—A very complex issue in international law is the relationship between national sovereignty and international law. According to the traditional view, a country is a member of the international community, and international law is binding on it, but only with its consent. In other words, a country can consider whether a certain international law will harm its sovereignty and decide whether to adopt it. This tradition has great shortcomings, because in this way, international law is subordinate to sovereignty, and international cooperation and order must also be based on national interests.</p>
<p>In the past, many people have proposed to reduce national sovereignty to suit international cooperation, such as Professor Laski of the United Kingdom. Now, this book has a further proposition. The latter part of its third basic principle states: "A country's sovereignty is subject to the limitations of international law." Isn't this revolutionizing the traditional international law?</p>
<p>(2) Creating New International Law—The binding force of international law is often weak, because it does not have a legislative and judicial body like domestic law. Although the Permanent Court of International Justice was established, nominally there was a judicial body, but the legislative body has always been lacking.</p>
<p>Proposal 7 of this book states: "The General Assembly, by a two-thirds vote and with the consent of the Executive Council, shall have the power to amend the general rules of international law and to implement new general rules of international law." This is the legislative body of international law, a new creation in international law.</p>
<p>Looking at the whole book, there are many such revolutionary and creative arguments. For those who like to study international law, or, in other words, for those who are concerned about mankind, this book is indeed a valuable reference for forming your thoughts or methods of saving the world.</p>

<h3>The Reconstruction of Libraries After the Calamity</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhao Zhen</p>
<p>In order to revive the intellectual life of the people in the war zones, the United States is now providing a large number of books and magazines to libraries and academic research institutions in Europe and the Far East. In order to rebuild the libraries that were arbitrarily and deliberately destroyed by the Germans and Japanese, American public and private organizations have been collecting a large number of academic books and magazines, preparing to ship them to various countries. In this war, the total number of books destroyed and lost is more than two hundred million. In Poland, 70% of the libraries were destroyed or looted. In the Czech Republic and Yugoslavia, more than half of the libraries were destroyed. The Soviet Union lost 50 million volumes of books. In China and the Philippines, in addition to seizing the books they needed and taking them back to Japan, the Japanese destroyed all the other books.</p>
<p>The scholars and experts in the war-torn countries have lost contact with the new inventions and new progress in academics. They know that there have been great and numerous inventions in science in recent years, but they have no way to study them. Therefore, universities, educational organizations, libraries, and government agencies in the United States started collecting books at the beginning of the war, so that they could be transported to various countries after the war.</p>
<p>The Rockefeller Foundation's Donation</p>
<p>In May 1941, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Library Relief Group of the American Library Association ordered a complete set of magazines to donate to the affected countries. Since 1941, the American Library Association has used 300,000 US dollars to order 365 specialized magazines, with an annual subscription of 35,710 periodicals, of which more than 90 are medical magazines. These magazines and other magazines donated by various organizations and individuals have been shipped to various countries.</p>
<p>In terms of books, the Rockefeller Foundation has allocated 200,000 US dollars to purchase 35 sets of specialized works, each with 750 specialized books, to be sent to China, Britain, Russia, France, Italy, Poland, the Czech Republic, etc. Now, a book order list has been prepared, selecting 1,600 specialized reference books, especially new books published in the last ten years. Among them, books on natural sciences and applied sciences account for 60%, and books on humanities and social sciences account for 40%.</p>
<p>As the relief agencies and relief plans in various parts of the United States are increasing, in order to make good use of funds and cooperate closely, there is a need for a central agency that can make overall plans. Therefore, in April 1945, the "American Book Relief Office" was established in the Library of Congress in Washington. Its task is to coordinate foreign library relief work, investigate the destruction of foreign libraries and their needs, collect books, and contact transportation ships. The "American Book Relief Office" plans to ship 1 million to 3 million books and magazines abroad in 1946. These large numbers of books are all donated by the American people. They are now conducting a fundraising campaign to solicit more than 400 specialized magazines, and each of the 48 states has a book collection station.</p>
<p>Efforts of Various Governments</p>
<p>The governments of various European countries have ordered a large number of books in the United States. The Chinese Ministry of Education has also ordered 20 sets, each with 195 specialized magazines. 80% are ordered for the National Peking Library, and 30% are ordered for the National Geological Survey. National Tsing Hua University has ordered new books worth 12,000 US dollars.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has also ordered several kinds of books and magazines in the United States, each with 60 copies.</p>
<p>Although the relief work for libraries destroyed in the war zone is mostly the effort of private individuals, the US State Department has also assisted countries in the Near East and the Far East. While the war was going on, the State Department sent photographic copies of 75 specialized scientific magazines to China every month. At that time, transportation was extremely difficult, and these relief supplies had to be transported to China by air over the Himalayas. Since 1937, the books donated by the US State Department to China have been worth 50,000 US dollars.</p>
<h3>Book Arrangement</h3>
<p>— Wei Yan</p>
<p>The Library of Congress in the United States is now busy soliciting books from the publishing industry across the country, classifying and sorting them, and then distributing them to many countries in the world that are recovering after the war. This shows that the Allied countries are developing all aspects of post-war construction in a balanced way. However, in our country, we unfortunately discovered a tragic contrast. It is said that when the Shanghai Municipal Museum was first taken over, there was nothing but a few empty rooms. The person in charge was also unable to develop it due to the shortage of municipal funds. Of course, it seems superfluous to talk about cultural construction in a country where even food is not enough. However, national construction should be developed in a balanced way in all aspects. We must consider the needs of the current society, but we must also prepare for the permanent plans of the future. This preparatory work should start with academic research.</p>
<p>Speaking of academic research, we feel it is too pitiful. Not only can we not talk about experimental instruments, but it is impossible to find a few more books to read. It can be said that there is not a complete library in any university in the country. It is unnecessary to say that the ancient books that were scattered after the war cannot be collected again. Even if we want to find a complete library that collects the latest publications in the country, it can be said that we have searched everywhere and cannot find it. The atmosphere of scholarship is not strong enough in the first place. In addition, a few people who want to read are either short of money to buy books or have no place to borrow books. How can this society progress?</p>
<p>Therefore, we hope that the state can take out a part of the money to purchase foreign books and distribute them to the libraries of major cities and universities across the country; in terms of the domestic publishing industry, it is best to donate new books to major libraries or give them a large discount each time they publish; establish a relatively complete library in each city, and do more work in organizing and collecting books. We must maintain China's spirit of establishing the country with culture for thousands of years.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Talking about Kunqu Opera's "Mountain Slope Sheep"</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>When I learn to sing Kunqu Opera, I often encounter "Mountain Slope Sheep" in the Shang tune. The most popular ones are "Broken Bridge" from *The Tale of the White Snake* at Leifeng Pagoda, "Hiding the Boat" from *Fisherman's Joy*, "Startled Dream" from *The Peony Pavilion*, and "Asking About Illness" from *The Jade Hairpin*. The singing methods of the latter two operas are not very similar to the former two; the former has excitement in sorrow, while the latter has tapestry in sorrow. The Shang tune belongs to autumn, which originally has the autumnal feeling of solemnity or sorrow.</p>
<p>Because I can sing "Mountain Slope Sheep," I reviewed all the "Mountain Slope Sheep" in the *Collected Opera Scores*. Based on the only ten operas available, plus "Asking About Illness" from other opera scores, it may be dangerous or not very reliable to draw conclusions. I will write it down for now, in order to make a more detailed summary in the future. The special phenomena I have seen are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Two large "Mountain Slope Sheep" can be independent suites. And they do not have a coda.</p>
<p>Liang Chenyu's *Washing Gauze* "Raising Horses" is like this, and *The Jade Hairpin*'s "Asking About Illness" is also like this.</p>
<p>(2) "Mountain Slope Sheep" is often linked to other palace modes, and rarely linked to the Mu mode.</p>
<p>In these eleven operas, "Mountain Slope Sheep" is often followed by Xianlv, Xianlv entering Shuangdiao, Shuangdiao, Zhengong, Zhonglv, Huangzhong, Yuediao, and even the Yu tune, but only "Broken Bridge" uses the Shang tune.</p>
<p>(3) "Mountain Slope Sheep" is most often linked to Xianlv or Xianlv entering Shuangdiao.</p>
<p>*Occupying the Flower Champion*'s "Selling Oil" "Mountain Slope Sheep" is linked to Xianlv's "Soap Gauze Gown," "Sobering Up Sweet Ganzhou," and "Soap Bean Looking at Hometown." However, a song "Jade Embracing Abdomen" with Xianlv entering Shuangdiao is inserted before "Soap Bean Looking at Hometown." *The Shepherd's Tale*'s "Watching Sheep" "Mountain Slope Sheep" is linked to Xianlv entering Shuangdiao's "Night Boat Sequence," "Black Hemp Sequence," "Brocade Clothing Fragrance," and "Pickled Vegetable Order." *Leifeng Pagoda*'s "Broken Bridge" is linked to Xianlv entering Shuangdiao's "Five Offerings" and "Jade Intersection School," with two songs of the original tune "Golden Bridle" attached at the end. *Double Red Tale*'s "Stealing Silk" "Mountain Slope Sheep" is linked to Xianlv's "Soap Bean Son." *Tonsure Tale*'s "Tonsure" "Mountain Slope Sheep" is also linked to Xianlv's "Second Offense by the Dressing Table," but two songs of the Zhonglv mode, "Moth to the Lamp," are attached at the end. Xu Zhiheng's *Easy to Know Opera Rules* Volume 2 has a few words that are well said: "Mountain Slope Sheep' belongs to sad songs, but if it is first sad and then happy, then Xianlv or Xianlv entering Shuangdiao can be connected, depending on the plot." Watching Sheep until freezing and starving, this is sadness, but eating the fairy's gift will not be hungry, this is happiness; Lady White blames Xu Xian for being ungrateful, for not letting Fahai bully her, this is sadness, but after meeting, she feels pity again, this is happiness; Selling oil for a living is sad, but seeing the Flower Champion at first sight seems to increase new vitality, this is also happiness; Hongxiao complains in her boudoir, waiting for her lover not to come, this is sadness, but she is carried away by Kunlun to meet Cui Sheng, this is also happiness. Tonsure does not fully conform to this statement, so it is not discussed.</p>
<p>"Mountain Slope Sheep" is connected to other tunes: "Hiding the Boat" is connected to Huangzhong's "Descending Yellow Dragon" and "Yellow Dragon Rolling," and "Startled Dream" is connected to Yuediao's "Mountain Peach Red" and "Cotton Batting." The Flower God sings Huangzhong, which can only be regarded as an interlude of a supporting role. *Jingchai Tale*'s "Crying Shoes" has the most chaotic connection, the order is: Xianlv entering Shuangdiao's "Rowing Boat" two songs, Yu tune's "Better than Flowers" one song and Yuediao's "Remembering Tiger Sequence" two songs. *Pipa Tale*'s "Eating Bran" is connected to Shuangdiao's "Filial Son" four songs and Zhengong's "Wild Geese Passing Sand" three songs. It seems that the first song cannot always be separated from Xianlv entering Shuangdiao or Shuangdiao.</p>
<p>(4) "Mountain Slope Sheep" is often used in two consecutive songs, and rarely used alone.</p>
<p>"Mountain Slope Sheep" is used in two consecutive songs in: Eating Bran, Watching Sheep, Stealing Silk, Crying Shoes, Raising Horses, Hiding the Boat, Broken Bridge, Asking About Illness eight operas, and only Tonsure, Startled Dream, Selling Oil three operas are used alone.</p>
<h3>Home</h3>
<p>— Tang Xialing</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>I haven't been home for more than two years, although it's only two or three hundred miles away from home. But not a day goes by that I don't miss home.</p>
<p>My parents, with their white hair, will be seventy years old next year. I haven't seen their kind faces for a long time. I wonder how much their health has deteriorated as they lean on the door every day, thinking of their wandering son? This is the first thing that I can't help but feel sad about.</p>
<p>My father's tomb has already arched up. I should also go back to offer two bowls of wheat rice and burn some paper money. After a person's death, what other meaning of tracing back to the ancestors can the children express besides this?</p>
<p>Although my wife is an ugly woman, we have had a close and loving relationship for twelve years since we got married. Especially those two little children, pulling on their mother's clothes, pretending to cry, and asking me when I will return?</p>
<p>Because of these concerns, I plan to go home once every day.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>My brother sent me a letter last month.</p>
<p>This letter in my heart is like a bloodstain carved by a sharp knife. Every time I think of it now, it still makes me cry out in pain.</p>
<p>One passage in the letter reads:</p>
<p>——You haven't been back for more than two years. Everyone at home misses you very much, especially your mother. Her health is getting weaker day by day. Whenever she thinks of you, tears well up in her eyes. Mother is afraid... I can't bear to say it: In short, come back and see her soon! Your two children are indeed lovely! Sometimes they look up with their little faces, pull on their mother's clothes, and ask: Mom! When is Dad coming back? Their expressions are so innocent, sincere, and eager for an answer——</p>
<p>At that time, I felt a pang in my heart! Hot tears rolled out of my eyes. At this moment, I seemed to see my mother holding a cane, sitting weakly in a chair. Looking at her melancholy and pale face, I felt that my mother was even older. The old lady didn't say a word, but her eyes were filled with tears of kindness. My wife was doing needlework next to her, and she also lowered her head, with hot tears falling one after another like pearls. The two children saw the adults like that, froze for a moment, and finally opened their little mouths inexplicably and cried out with a "wah" sound. The whole room was filled with an atmosphere of sadness and a mood of sorrow, which made me even more sad!</p>
<p>I lay on the table, not knowing how long I cried.</p>
<p>The sound of the midday cannon liberated me from the encirclement of sadness. At that time, I clenched my fists and resolutely asked for leave to go back.</p>
<p>I didn't expect that I have delayed until now and haven't gone north yet.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>The year before last, I went home and stayed for a few days. The taste was really very uncomfortable!</p>
<p>My hometown is not very peaceful.</p>
<p>The heavy taxes and corvée labor forced people to become bandits all over the place. Killing and robbery are simply a nightly occurrence. My family is poor now, so I'm not afraid of bandits coming to rob us, but I worked in the local administration for two years, offending the heroes of Liangshan, which may be inevitable. Seeing their cruel methods, it really made me anxious and unable to sleep peacefully at night.</p>
<p>At the same time, I went back with empty sleeves, wearing old and worn coarse cloth clothes. Although my family members were not as snobbish as Su Ji's parents, wife, and sister-in-law, looking at my own shabby appearance, I always felt a little embarrassed.</p>
<p>Especially those old men in the countryside, who love money the most; they heard that I was back and came to my house to see me. After a few vulgar greetings, they began to ask me: "How much salary do you get in a month? How much money did you bring back this time?" It seemed that life was all about money. I returned with empty pockets, which really made them embarrassed to ask. A feeling of disgust and contempt immediately floated in my heart. But I had no choice but to smile faintly.</p>
<p>My mother understood my pain and said from the side:</p>
<p>—Money! He may have several thousand a month, but he doesn't live like we do at home, saving money. He has many young friends outside, and he spends a lot of money on socializing. Our family is poor anyway, and we can't get rich with ill-gotten gains. I don't want him to mess around with money, because those who exploit the people will not have prosperous descendants! He has a few fixed salaries, so where would he have any money left? The travel expenses for his return this time will probably have to be raised at home—</p>
<p>Indeed, no one in the family wants me to make money, even though we are poor.</p>
<p>Such a family really gives a lot of spiritual comfort to the wandering son who returns sick and poor!</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>I didn't have any money to bring back home, and on the contrary, my return added some burden to the family. It wouldn't matter if the family was rich.</p>
<p>Some relatives, friends, and neighbors all came to see me, from early morning to late at night. There were always guests in the house. When it came to mealtime, of course, I had to treat them to a simple meal. Although there was nothing good to eat in the countryside, a few cooked dishes, half a catty of rice wine, and some steamed buns were the least I could offer. These expenses, plus a batch of travel expenses for my return, and the family buying more than two dan of grain,</p>
<p>Drinking rice wine and not getting enough sleep made me feel exhausted and hoarse, unable to continue.</p>
<p>I could only sleep until midnight, and as soon as the rooster crowed and the dog barked, I would panic and get up to listen. When I was sleeping well in the morning, my wife would come to the room to call me, saying that there were more guests outside. Although I felt a little annoyed in my heart, I felt that people were coming with good intentions, so I had to get up, rub my eyes, and go out. I didn't even have time to take a nap at noon. Everyone knows that I can drink alcohol. When guests come to the house, I can't help but entertain them diligently and drink with them to their heart's content. Guessing the numbers, drinking non-stop for several days, I couldn't help but drink a little too much. So on the fourth day of my return home, my eyes started to become red and swollen, and my throat became hoarse at the same time.</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>The eight years of the Yellow River disaster made my hometown suffer beyond description!</p>
<p>Many neighbors who used to live here have now fled to escape the famine. In the bitter north wind, some tattered and low thatched huts: a few adults and children with emaciated faces and bird-like bodies, wearing ragged clothes, came out, holding small baskets and ropes, and crouched down to dig for vegetables and firewood on the hill. Their appearance was very pitiful! But they still had to struggle on the line of hunger and cold.</p>
<p>Even in such a miserable situation in the countryside, the corrupt officials still had to scrape!</p>
<p>The reception fee for the Bao Public Office was two or three thousand yuan a month. The beasts in human clothes were eating and drinking the last drop of blood from the common people.</p>
<p>To pay 50 catties of public grain, you have to prepare 80 catties on an old scale in advance. Their scales are like modern publications, specially made in extra-large sizes.</p>
<p>I don't know how many young men the country wants, and they have to pay for it several times a year. But it's also cheap, as long as you are willing to send two coins, you will be safe and sound immediately. They want to make a living for their families, so they give gifts according to their ability.</p>
<p>A family just bought a few liters of soybeans, preparing to cook them with vegetables, but the Township Soldier adult came and took them away, saying that the army needed horse feed</p>
<p>In addition, they squandered, embezzled, and simply did everything. It made people angry after hearing about it. But I didn't have the financial resources or time to come out to help them and file a complaint for our compatriots, to fight for justice. In fact: they are all connected from top to bottom, colluding with each other. Even if I come out to make trouble, it won't do any good. Unless I am a sword fairy or a knight-errant, who can kill people with flying knives.</p>
<p>I am a small coward, a poor civil servant, who likes to be quiet, has a soft heart, but also has a bit of foolishness. How can I dare to go back to such a dangerous, money-worshipping, frequently entertaining, full of scars, gloomy and dark society?</p>
<p>(6)</p>
<p>The family is full of love, warmth, which makes people intoxicated and forget all the hatred, animosity, and all sins in society.</p>
<p>In my hometown, society has revealed its dark side. The common people are struggling, groaning, and wandering on the line of hunger and cold. Corrupt officials are sucking human blood, eating the bones and flesh of their compatriots. After eating and drinking their fill, they let out a triumphant grin.</p>
<p>The taste of going home is like eating a licorice root, it is sweet at first, but there is also some bitterness in the sweetness.</p>
<p>But I still want to go home.</p>
<p>I want to return to my loving mother's embrace: let her kind hands caress me, caress my whole body, and immerse me in the sea of kindness and love; so that my body and mind can be revived.</p>
<p>At my father's tomb, I want to cry my heart out! But not just for myself.</p>
<p>Leading my two children: I want to learn from Lao Laizi in front of my mother, dressing in colorful clothes to amuse her. When my mother sees it, she will definitely laugh out loud, and maybe hug me in her arms and call me a good son.</p>
<p>My wife will laugh even more and open her cherry-like mouth.</p>
<p>How happy the family is! I want to go back quickly!</p>
<p>However, many terrible shadows of my hometown suddenly come to my mind again.</p>
<h3>Female Soldiers</h3>
<p>— Carved by Renfeng</p>
<h3>Climbing Mountains and Paving Roads</h3>
<p>— Zhong Yuan</p>
<p>When I was a child, I heard an old gentleman with gray hair say this: "Life is a desolate mountain, and the long, boundless years are the chaotic, rugged stone steps on that mountain. When I was young, I panted and sweated on this desolate mountain, yearning for the wonders and flowers at the summit, fantasizing about beautiful white clouds and blue skies, desperately climbing and climbing, ignoring the sharp rocks and thorns under my feet, forgetting the cliffs and deep valleys on both sides, just single-mindedly climbing until I was old, climbing up, and with great difficulty, I reached the summit. But alas, when I reached the summit and looked, there was nothing there, and I was heading down the mountain!"</p>
<p>Is life really so empty and illusory?</p>
<p>For many years, I was indeed perplexed and doubtful because of that gentleman's words; whether in the dripping rain of late night or in the faint white light of early morning, I never forgot: I am climbing a mountain! I am not afraid of panting and sweating, nor am I afraid of sharp rocks, thorns, cliffs, and precipices; I am only afraid that when I painstakingly climb to the summit, there will really be nothing there, and I will be heading down the mountain! - How sad I would be then!</p>
<p>Fortunately, I suddenly found an answer:</p>
<p>It was a lovely young friend who once drew a picture in my autograph book with her slender little hands. In the picture, there was a strong man wearing a straw hat, paving a long road in a desolate wilderness. He held an iron shovel in one hand, removing the rocks and bricks in front; and in the other hand, he held seeds of flowers, scattering them all the way. So, in the places where he scattered them, beautiful roses and fragrant roses bloomed, colorful butterflies danced in front of the flowers, and lively little birds flew high in the sky...</p>
<p>My friend did not inscribe any words on the painting, but this profound revelation was enough! ——</p>
<p>I am not climbing a mountain, I am paving a road!</p>
<p>God has not prepared a ready-made beautiful summit for anyone; God has only given anyone an iron shovel and a packet of flower seeds, telling them to create for themselves, to pave a road filled with fragrant flowers!</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng 23</p>
<p>Chapter Three: Oath</p>
<p>The night is deep.</p>
<p>The sound of artillery in the southern suburbs of Beiping gradually stopped; the sound of gunfire also went from sparse to sporadic, and then stopped.</p>
<p>Looking at Beiping from the suburbs, under the cover of clouds, under the roaring artillery fire that resounded across the fields, and the sudden silence that followed, this ancient city was as quiet as a tomb that had been around for a thousand years. If you were to think of its once prosperous scenes of dragons and tigers vying with each other, of wind, bridges, and battle horses, you might inevitably feel melancholy for it.</p>
<p>From dawn to sunset, to late at night, the people of Beiping, with tense emotions, on the one hand, resisted the tides of events that repeatedly washed over them, and on the other hand, secretly inquired about each other, "What exactly is the situation?" At the same time, they also had to grasp the jobs that sustained their three meals a day and continue to do them; until they picked up their tools, closed the doors, yawned, and with a little worry, climbed into their beds or kangs.</p>
<p>A certain part of the people in the city, a certain special "chosen people," we can freely use "living in a drunken dream" or "intoxicated by wealth" to describe them; it is only these people who are intoxicated or dreaming, I don't know whether they have lost their souls, or whether they are nostalgic for the last bit of the former capital's prosperity that has already declined, painstakingly supporting the ending of this daily, final climax - the "The End" of the movie theater, the "Please Come Again Tomorrow" of the garden, on the edge of the Eight Great Hutongs, Han Antan, may be able to hear the last cry of "Customer—" or "See you tomorrow, sir," in an excessively shrill voice.</p>
<p>All of this has passed, and the huge city can be said to have superficially stopped its activities.</p>
<p>I say "superficially" because there is also an "inside." In this "inside," there are at least two forces that are still actively striving towards the peak of the climax at this time: one force is excitedly discussing how to continue the great massacres, "sweeps," and "total reductions." But one force is very calmly planning how to save this human catastrophe.</p>
<p>At this time, if you were standing on the enemy tower of Chongwenmen, you would see a man of medium build, wearing an untidy Western suit, dragging his heavy steps, but very alert, walking out of Dongjiaomin Lane. He seemed very tired, because he came from the southern suburbs, winding his way through several layers of scattered gunfire, experiencing at least three risks, and a considerable amount of trouble.</p>
<p>If you followed behind him, you could see this lonely and cold shadow walking to the end of Dongjiaomin Lane, onto Chongwenmen Street Avenue, pausing slightly, looking around, and then walking towards Dongdan Archway.</p>
<p>At this time, he suddenly felt his steps lighter and his legs full of energy; because although the streetlights in Beiping were dim, he could vaguely see a six-story building standing less than an arrow's shot to the east. This was the destination of his trip. On each floor of the building, there were still one or two dim lights, adorning a glimmer of life in Beiping.</p>
<p>When he reached the opposite side of this tall building, he stopped. As far as his eyes could see, he couldn't see a single figure at either end of the street. Believing that the situation was suitable, he then raised a hand, as if casually, scratching his hair a few times, and tidied his collar, then lifted his light footsteps, nimbly crossed the street, and walked straight into the half-rolled gate.</p>

<p>You have escaped danger, the bandits have been brought to justice, and the efforts of the military and police authorities in investigating and preventing the crime, all those who have read the full report of the Garrison Headquarters cannot help but praise and admire the diligence, bravery, agility, and tireless spirit of the staff engaged in handling this case. This is your good fortune, a guarantee of the safety of the citizens, and even more the glory of those responsible for maintaining law and order!</p>
<p>Although the matter has ended, it is said that there are still some small loose ends to be dealt with. These loose ends are the ransom paid by your family to the kidnappers, which was seized by the Third Front Army and the Investigation Department of the Police Bureau Garrison Headquarters, totaling more than 240,000 US dollars. It is said that this stolen money should be returned to the kidnapped person according to law, and the Garrison Department has notified you to go to the Military Law Department of the Garrison Department today to claim it.</p>
<p>Whether such a situation "legally" requires a return is for legal scholars to answer, but for your sake, I am afraid it is not necessary to claim this money back. The reason is nothing more than: (1) When your family took out this money, the purpose was to get you out of danger, and they never intended to get it back. This is just like the old Chinese saying, so-called seeking "wealth gone, person safe and happy"; (2) To take a step back and think, if the kidnappers had spent all the money before the case was solved and it could not be recovered, wouldn't that also be a very likely thing?</p>
<p>Therefore, we would like to suggest that you establish a "Desheng Scholarship" with this money to help those students who have no money to study. In this way, not only will those students who benefit be grateful for life, but the country and society will also benefit from it.</p>
<p>Recently, the schools are desolate and tuition is expensive, you can't not know this; the movement to respect teachers, the education loan, the Uncle Ping Public Scholarship, and the efforts and appeals of many other enthusiastic people, you can't not know this either. More than 240,000 US dollars, converted to about 784.4 million Chinese yuan at the current legal tender exchange rate of 3350, is not a small amount. If you agree with this matter and implement it immediately, the effect it will produce is immeasurable.</p>
<p>We admire your achievements in the real estate industry, and we are even more confident that after you understand these reasons, you will have the determination to help the out-of-school youth in Shanghai today. Therefore, we are willing to appeal to and suggest to you!</p>
<p>Mental Hygiene</p>
<h3>How to Cope with Melancholy: Suppression or Release?</h3>
<p>— Guiting</p>
<p>"Everything must be held in moderation, excess will cause harm!" - The motto of mental health.</p>
<p>Some people are very calm, it seems that even if Mount Tai collapses in front of them, they will not move. But some people are the complete opposite, even if they are slightly stimulated, they will be restless and at a loss. In fact, from a physiological and psychological point of view, these two types of people may be equally nervous.</p>
<p>In the environment we are currently in, nervous stimulation is absolutely unavoidable. Our question is: how can we properly release these nervous energies to avoid excessive tension.</p>
<p>Methods of Release</p>
<p>There are roughly four ways to release nervous energies to avoid excessive tension: (1) To dilute nervous tension with muscle movement, so many small movements are made, such as chewing gum, shaking legs, or making gestures, etc., (2) To release nervous energies from the mouth with sound, such as singing, boasting, or talking and laughing; (3) To maintain external calmness by consuming body tissues, resulting in unexpected obstacles to the normal movement of the internal organs. Therefore, many people who cannot arbitrarily release their emotions due to their social status, such as business owners, professors, lawyers, etc., are usually the most susceptible to digestive and heart problems; (4) Another type is the method of conceptual movement. These people always like to fantasize all day long, researching some ways to solve problems in empty castles in the air; sometimes they turn over in their minds how to deal with people who insult them. This also belongs to this type of way of releasing nervous tension.</p>
<p>Muscle Movement</p>
<p>Of these four types of ways, muscle movement is the most effective. We have also noticed that the nerves of laborers are never as tense as those of office workers and office staff. For example, workers who hammer stones never suffer from insomnia. As for conceptual movement, it may sometimes be able to adapt to the environment and be beneficial. But its harm has two aspects: (1) Because this does not require consuming much physiological energy, it still fails to reduce excessive tension, (2) Fantasizing too much may sometimes reach the point where one cannot distinguish between dreams and reality. The effect of reducing nervous tension by using sound from the mouth is in between the above two, and this is the easiest way to dispel the melancholy in the chest. Maintaining external calmness by consuming body tissues is the most undesirable way, because nervous tension has nowhere to release, and the result can only develop inward, attacking the relatively weak internal organs, and then all kinds of diseases arise, such as heart disease, indigestion, headache, etc.</p>
<p>Do Not Suppress Excessively</p>
<p>The biggest mistake in our current life is to close the outlets that nature has given us to release nervous tension, and we never try to find other outlets. The following suggestions may be helpful to people suffering from nervous tension. First, we can change our lifestyle to reduce nervous tension. In particular, vigorous exercise is very effective. Second, we sometimes have to choose the ways to release nervous tension, so that they can exert the greatest effect in special situations. For example, if you accidentally knock over an ink bottle and make a mess everywhere. At that time, you can grumble a bit, or be busy using blotting paper to dry it, to release the stimulation you have received mentally. Then, needless to say, the latter method is more suitable. This is called "special adaptation" in psychology. Third, we can sometimes also use supplementary actions unrelated to the current environment to release mental tension. The following example can serve as proof. Two classes of college students participated in the exam. One class was ordered to sit quietly and take the exam without making any movements; while the other class was allowed to move freely or make any sound. As a result, the students in the latter class chewed gum, waved their hands and feet, and made all kinds of movements during the exam. And the students in the other class became so nervous that they became hysterical. Therefore, after we are mentally stimulated, it is best to go to the garden for a walk, go to the kitchen to bake cookies, or even bite our nails or play the piano randomly.</p>
<p>Repeated Attempts</p>
<p>This is always more beneficial than putting our palms together, pretending to be happy, and showing off our self-control ability. Fourth, if you have tried the above methods and they have not worked, you can use the method of "repeated attempts." This is also a term in psychology, and its principle is: "If you fail at the beginning, you should try again once or countless times." Fifth, the most important motto for mental health is: "Everything must be held in moderation, excess will cause harm." For example, we get up early in the morning, eat a hearty meal, or exercise, and then bury ourselves in solving arithmetic problems. At first, the spirit is excited, and the sharpness and speed gradually increase. But to a certain extent, the mind will become dull, and eventually even completely collapse. Therefore, when we are "in moderation," that is, when we are not too nervous, it is the most effective and easiest time to do work.</p>

<p>Minyi: Sorry, my virtuous wife, is doing appeals and retrials for me... alas...</p>
<p>Gongbo: Why hasn't Brother ×× come yet?</p>
<p>Minyi: He is so happy, he goes to dance halls in Chongqing every day?</p>
<p>Gongbo: (Sighs) Alas, the greatest traitors in the world are only you and Gongbo.</p>
<h3>Low Key</h3>
<p>— San Gong</p>
<p>The case of the naval soldier killing the tram conductor can be seen as an example of "vigorous morale."</p>
<p>When the foreign exchange was adjusted, Mayor Wu once strongly stated that it would not affect the prices of daily necessities. At the end of August, the city government announced the cost of living index, which was indeed similar to that of July. Only then did we know that the mayor was not deceiving us.</p>
<p>I remember a prophet once said: "There will be no summer this year." His prediction was indeed correct. Look, isn't the hottest weather this year not in summer but in autumn?</p>
<p>"The Master was gentle, kind, respectful, frugal, and yielding, and thus he attained it." This motto, if used when riding trams and buses, is sufficient to become "The Master was gentle, kind, respectful, frugal, and yielding, and thus he lost it."</p>

<h3>Indian Dignitary: Nehru</h3>
<p>— Xizhi</p>
<p>Britain has finally allowed India's independence at the Simla Conference. The current Chairman of the Indian National Congress, Nehru, has accepted the invitation of the British Governor-General Wavell to serve as the organizer of the transitional government for India's independence, leading India towards true freedom and equality. Here is some information about Nehru:</p>
<p>As far back as the eighteenth century, his ancestors moved from that highland area to the fertile plain area. This ancestor, named Raj Kaul, was a prestigious scholar of Persian and Sanskrit, highly valued by the emperor of the then Mongol dynasty, and moved to the imperial city of Delhi, and even received a fief, including a residence on a canal. Therefore, the word "Nehru" (meaning canal) was linked to the name of this ancestor and became part of his name. Later, the word "Kaul" was gradually canceled, and we simply call him "Nehru."</p>
<p>This clan went through several periods of prosperity and decline. As a result, the fief was exhausted. Later, it was affected by the Indian national revolutionary movement of 1857 and lost everything. His grandfather and two uncles had no choice but to join the refugee group and flee to Agra. At this time, India was occupied and ruled by Britain with tyranny, until today.</p>
<p>His father, in his later years, hated the British tyrannical rule over India, resolutely abandoned everything, and became a fighter for Indian national liberation, fighting for Indian national liberation, but died of overwork in 1931.</p>
<p>From his childhood, he was often influenced by the ideas of his cousin, filled with resentment towards foreign rule. At the same time, he was also influenced by his tutor Brooks (an American). In 1905, at the age of sixteen, he went to England to study at Harrow School; then he transferred to Cambridge University to study. He liked literature and books, and loved the works of Oscar Wilde (a British aesthetic writer at the end of the nineteenth century). At the same time, because he wanted to defend the Indian revolutionaries who were in American prisons at that time, he also seriously studied law.</p>
<p>In 1912, at the age of twenty-three, he returned to China and immediately participated in the national movement. He was the leader of the Indian Muslim community. When the non-cooperation movement occurred in 1921, he enthusiastically supported this movement, which led to his first arrest and imprisonment. To date, he has been arrested as many as seven times. In prison, he was treated relatively leniently, because he was allowed to read and write, which instead became a good opportunity to study political economy, turning him into a socialist thinker. After more than ten years of struggle, his position in India has become increasingly lofty. The entire Indian people respect and love him only after Gandhi. He is not only a loyal believer of Gandhi, but also Gandhi's only successor. His wife, Kamana, is an outstanding woman who was imprisoned for following her husband in the revolution, and therefore her health deteriorated and she died in 1936. He has a daughter named Medina, who is a student studying in the United States.</p>
<p>In order to promote the friendship between China and India. During our country's war of resistance, he seriously came to China for sightseeing once. After returning to China, he actively encouraged domestic universities to add a Chinese literature department. This shows that China gave him a profound influence, and he has great hopes for our China.</p>
<p>He has a torso of five feet and ten inches in height, and is very handsome. He likes sports and swimming, and loves writing and landscapes. When he was a child, he also liked to eat meat, but due to Gandhi's advice, he has been a vegetarian since 1920. Tobacco is always in hand, and he may drink a little alcohol when he goes abroad.</p>
<p>He usually wears a white Gandhi hat, and under the white hat, gray hair is revealed, which shows how hard he has worked for India. His face is quite white, unlike the Indians we usually see in Shanghai. He wears a white Indian-style waist coat, with a vest on the outside, just like other Indian Gandhi followers. He wears straw sandals on his feet. With this dress, you would never think that he is a person of noble birth.</p>
