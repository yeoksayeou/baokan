<h3>政府昨日頒布命令　國民大會延期舉行　主席招待各黨派茶會</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕國大代表決定廿五日開始報到，據非正式統計，集中京滬之各地代表已逾五百人，聞大會因時期迫促，不及完成會前之若干準備，有擬延至本月廿日舉行說。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿四日電〕國民政府令：原定本年五月五日召開之國民大會，着延期舉行，延展日期另定之，此令。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿四日電〕政府發言人吳國禎透露：蔣主席廿四日宣布，預定於五月五日召開之國民大會，已無定期展期，因共產黨與民主同盟尙未披露其代表名單。蔣主席廿四日下午四時召集少數黨及無黨無派代表舉行茶會，請其提出代表名單。當彼等宣稱尙未準備就緒時，主席即云中央政府原擬遵照政協協定，於五月五日召開國民大會，但目下必須予以展期，至於以後何日召開，將再行決定。同時政協綜合小組已預定召集會議，以謀獲致各黨派均可同意之政治解決方案。國民大會必須展期之主要理由，似爲東北爆炸性之局勢，該方面共產黨由於佔佔領長春以及在蘇聯撤離哈爾濱時預料將予以佔領之故，其地位業已增强。吳宣傳部長昨日吿新聞記者云：渠信共產黨希望國民大會展期，直至東北問題獲得對彼等滿意之解決。渠稱：共產黨不願中國各地按照政協決議使其正常化，此乃彼等吹毛求疵之理由所在。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿四日電〕中國共產黨代表周恩來，爲召集國民大會問題，再函政府代表張羣·邵力子·張厲生三人，有所申述，茲經三氏予以答覆，原函如下：恩來先生惠鋻：頃接四月廿四日大函，本欲對所舉事實經過有所辨明，適值蔣主席於本日下午約集各方代表商談，政府爲顯全大局，當已採納各方意見，將國民大會展期舉行，俾便協商。至來函所提及之擴大政府組織及憲草等問題，本已迭次洽商，並有解決途徑可循，其間是非屈直，自不必再作文字上之聲辯，惟冀貴方以國家利益爲前題，並念人民之痛苦，　誠布公，協力以促使政治協商會議一切協議皆得早見實現，以慰全國人民喁喁之望，則幸甚矣，專此布復，即頌大安。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾將提建議書　謀東北全面停戰　徐永昌任三人組政府代表</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕據悉：馬歇爾於詳細硏究各方報吿後，即將提出一建議書，彼可能建議東北全面停戰，同時美國杜魯門總統或國務院可能發表一對華政策之聲明。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕昨日由渝來京之某要員，曾微露政府已接受馬歇爾元帥建議，將盡最大可能，繼續對共黨讓步，本「相忍爲國」，「相忍爲民」悲天憫人之恕道，於今後三日內重啓談判之門，謀打開東北僵局。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿四日電〕令日獲悉：軍令部長徐永昌將軍，已繼軍政部長陳誠將軍爲軍事三人小組政府代表，徐氏已與馬歇爾將軍舉行會商，衆信三人小組不久可能開會。同時馬歇爾與蔣主席及周恩來從長計議，以謀解決東北問題。馬歇爾雖未發表任何聲明，但衆信渠已獲得若干進展，「新民報」稱：馬歇爾於聽取周恩來之報吿後，已建議一新和平方案，但其方案與周氏之計劃間，尙有相當距離，大多數人均信，現行慨局不久即可打開。「世界日報」稱：馬歇爾對於調解衝突表示樂觀，聞馬歇爾最近與周恩來舉行會議時，曾第一次提出確定之建議，屢次堅持必須獲得解決辦法。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕軍調部商派第卅一小組赴長春事，因中共謂長春無戰事，拒絕派人而擱淺。惟該小組政府代表已派出，仍於廿五日晨隨副參謀長鈕先銘飛瀋，美方代表雖亦派出，但因中共拒絕而緩行。廿五日晨同行者，尙有東北中心執行小組政府組長蔡宗濂。又担任軍調部新聞處政府處長費毓洪，美方處長凱斯，一二日來平，近日執行部美方人員大增，率皆來自縮小機構之美軍總部，綜計達五百餘人。勢即將展開，以謀解放長春，並樹立國民政府自大連至哈爾濱之主權。中共代表則稱：「聯合民主軍」將繼續奪鬥，並將盡力反對政府軍深入，據聞中共軍已炸毀長春以南鐵路橋樑數座，並已在城四周建築防禦工事。但各觀察家咸謂，中共軍武器窳劣，不能作大規模陣地戰，僅可從事流動性戰爭。同時，長春方面中共軍入城已八日，其行政權於蘇軍撤退兩日後即已樹立目下局勢平靜，巷戰係局部性質，長春中共軍司令對於一部份未及撤退之政府官吏，已保證其安全。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿四日電〕國軍新一軍已抵達長春南方六十公里地點。</p>
<p>瀋陽各火中學生三千餘人，爲要求「國軍迅速接收東北」，「反對東北特殊化」舉行大遊行，沿途高唱愛國口號，情緒激昻，圖爲參加遊行之學生。</p>
<h3>懷念長春（中）</h3>
<p>— 方仁寄於瀋陽</p>
<p>四平的一幕，住在長春的人，早就有些風聲傳入耳內，而三月十六日，滿炭大棋的負責人又宣布了，凡「無必要的人員」都要離開長春。十七日，凡是由長春叫問四平的電話，更不要談到四平以南的瀋陽，瀋陽以南的錦州，全都不通了，長春在情勢上已呈孤立之勢。同日，黑龍江，合江兩省府接收人員，全由哈爾濱乘快車回到了長春，滿炭大樓中，本來就住着很多的人，突然又增加了百數十位，外面的傳說，旣紛紜而且緊張，人心的不安，自在意想之中。</p>
<p>其實，長春向不穩方面邁步，在廿四日以前，屬於空氣一方面的，就有過那麽一度，當時市內盛傳蘇軍將於二十四日下午九時退走，某方面的隊伍於當夜就要入城，家家準備買臘燭，買糊食，儲水，忙得眞像積極在翰旋「應變」。事實的表現，誠然屬於相反，人心，却藉以獲得了鎭定，因爲謠言被事實所粉碎，終令人覺到：謠言畢竟是謠言。然而老百姓盼望國軍到達的熱烈的希望，並不因此而稍減，有許多人在那虔誠禱吿，望能早日到達。他們知道：以在十四年痛苦生活的敎訓，在身心上已經有了一個刻骨銘心的烙痕，只有國軍到了，　能象徵着讓那可憎惡的十四年往史，澈頭澈尾的在生命史上把那一頁揭過。他們見人會問：國軍究竟到了什麽地方？是不是過了四平，到了公主嶺？但是，沒有人能予他們以滿意的答覆。</p>
<p>蘇軍撤退聲中，長春已經接收的若干機關中，不少當地年輕的職員：大抵爲二十歲左右的。由穿警察服裝的「同胞」作媒介，「傳」到某方兵營內，這時便有一位說我們北方官話的軍官，勸這靑年背井離鄉，遠適異域去學習軍事，要不，便願以高價作酬勞，只要能按時給他們一些消息。比方說，「某人是從什麼地方來的」？「是不是他有反　的思想」？像這一類簡單的問題，如果獲得了答覆，發問的人都能感到滿意，而且還要從物質生活上着眼，說：「你們待遇太苦了，我們送給你的錢，只是表示一點兒意思」。固然，以往十四年，若十中國人被日本强迫着，只能說：「我是「滿洲國」人」。並几也眞眞作過了牛馬，爲「滿洲國」流過血汗，但是，主人與奴隸的滋味，異族與同胞的區別，雖年在廿歲左右的人，他都能明白這些甜酸苦辣麻的味道。</p>
<p>長春蘇軍在三月十九日就開始有撤退的情形，市區西部蘇軍作營房用的大建築，當天就空出來了好幾所，空朗朗的只剩軀壳的建築，隨日增加，而巨形戰車一輛接着一輛，爬向了車站，開出了長春。這時滿炭大樓中，集結的接收人員，也走得極多，偌大一所大樓中，在大飯廳內，每餐須吃四次始能人人吃着飯，結果改成兩次，最後只有一次。人越來越少，大樓中，繁華顯然又成過去，冷落，單調，不安，在每一個人的深心作怪。這種情緒的反面，住在滿炭大樓中的人，和市民的要求是一致的，盼望國軍早日開抵長春。</p>
<p>形勢隨日嚴重，不能打人準備防人打的，由北平於一月五日開始空運長春的保安第二總隊，以及由陳家珍編成的保安第四總隊，再加上當地的警察，分駐入空出來的各大建築物中，而且修築防禦工事，以防不測。在入市區的馬路上，在市區以內的衝要所在，保安隊和警察開始檢査行人，曾經在入市的柴車上，檢査出渦機關槍。廿七日，這天是長春向去冬以來，第一次下雨的一天，當天夜裏，細雨濛濛中，在市郊又査獲了三輛卡車，一輛小臥車，車牌是東北行營，駕駛却佩着東北保安司令長官部的符號，斯夜，在郊區響着，不僅有槍聲，而且有砲聲，電燈更趕熱鬧，夜裏忽然滅了好幾次，在以往這種現象不常有過，於是，這一切把長春的不穩，洪托得更加明顯。</p>
<h3>東九省北部共軍南移　哈爾濱機塲被佔　國軍距長春僅六十公里</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕官方訊：東九省北部共軍向南移動，似圖確保長春。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕瀋陽廿四日下午二時急電，廿四日此問派機一架飛哈爾濱，見機塲已被共軍佔領，未降落即折回。廿四日午間，瀋行營電台曾與哈軍事代表團通報，哈台稱，哈市情勢恐怖。</p>

<p>〔中央社瀋陽二十三日電〕哈爾濱情勢日趨嚴重，蘇軍廿五日即將撒退，中央及地方人員，已陸續由哈飛瀋。廿三日又有省市一部行政人員及交部與中行等及部門接收人員，八十餘人，分乘四機由哈抵瀋，中央社記者亦同機抵此。哈市情形混亂，在國軍未進駐前，究將有如何變化，現尙難言。董彥平團長將隨蘇軍離哈，嫩江省主席彭濟羣及省府人員於今晨由齊齊哈爾趕至哈埠，準備撤退。</p>

<p>〔中央社重慶廿四日電〕蔣主席廿四日在陪都各界歡送會上致詞，全文如下：各位先生同志們，本席感覺今天是政府遷都重慶八年以來最光榮·最快樂·最値得紀念的一天，我們政府花抗戰局勢艱難危急的時期遷都重慶，經過長期艱苦的奮鬥，終於獲得最後的勝利，這固然是全國軍民同胞一致努力的結果，然而我們重慶同胞與政府同甘苦，共患難，生死成敗相一致的關係，較之其他各地尤爲密切。回想敵勢猖獗時期，重慶每天都要遭受敵人殘忍的轟炸，市民同胞的生命財產，遭受不測的損失，然而大家爲表示對於抗戰的忠誠，對於政府的擁護前仆後繼，效死弗辭，這種忠貞不貳，艱苦卓絕的精神，是本席夢寐不忘的。至於重慶市民在抗戰期間轍財輸力之多，尤爲全國其他各地之冠，這種偉大的貢獻，在將來抗戰史上必將大書特書而永垂國民效忠國家的良好模範。本席生長浙江，從事革命起於廣東，然自十三歲離鄉以後，即無一地連駐八年之久如重慶者，所以重慶實爲木席的第二故鄕。還都以後，本席夫婦對於重慶的同胞，必念念不忘，對於重慶的建設，必極力倡導，亦願我重慶同胞與本席個人的情感因別離而益增，因日久而益篤，其因在抗戰期間殉職殉難同胞的寡婦孤兒，本席離渝以後，勢必照顧難周，尤望各士紳同志，推老吾老，幼吾幼之心，協助本市政府。妥爲敎養，才能安慰先烈在天之靈，也才能獎勵社會忠貞的亮節，最後本席謹祝吾重慶日益發展，重慶同胞的生活日臻康樂，而成爲全國模範的都市。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>保持原子能秘密問題</h3>
<p>自從盟軍於一九四五年八月五日在廣島上空投下了第一顆原子炸彈以來，繼着八月八日在長崎上空投下了第二顆原子炸彈，兩天之內就有日本乞降的呼籲，第二次世界大戰，就告了結束，人類也進入了一個新的原子能時代，關於原子能的利用及其應否保守秘密或交由國際機構管制，於是議論紛紛。聯合國機構雖一向有原子能委員會的組織，企圖以聯合國這個機構來負起管制原子能利用的責任，但一面在加拿大却發見有大規模的秘密組織，企圖獲致利用原子能的秘密輸出於國外。從這一點，即可知對於原子能的利用，各方如何關心。最近英國工黨主席拉斯基敎授自美遊歷回英，在會議席上談稱：「美國新造之原子炸彈，較之在日本所投者威力更大，一枚炸彈可毀滅美國印第安那及伊利諾兩大州，五枚炸彈可摧毀馬遜狄克松綫以南美國全部。」拉斯基敎授對於原子能之發展保守秘密政策，因加抨擊，稱爲「對於人類安寗之攻擊」，其言曰：「余望吾人動員全部力量，以結束此項秘密政策之非法應用；此項政策以毒害吾人每一國際關係之通路爲威脅。」</p>
<p>拉斯基敎授之談話出後，即引起華盛頓方面之反響。據聯合社華盛頓廿一日電：此間原子彈專家對拉斯基敎授所發表之談話，咸表不悅。拉斯基敎授反對原子能發展保守秘密一層，不能獲得官方大多同情。熟悉原子彈人士對於拉斯基所述之原子彈破壞能力，均表訝異。就目下所知，依照「馬哈母圖樣」造出之原子彈，與轟炸長崎所用者，式樣並無多大變動。一部分科學家估計，此項炸彈之效力，較之轟炸廣島者，增加效力約百分之二十五。官方已宣布此項炸彈威力與二萬噸炸藥相等。同時參議院原子能特別委員會委員哈特亦加批評稱：「余深感拉斯基君對其所述之事，實際一無所知，即有所知，余亦不能同意將此公開」。</p>
<p>拉斯基敎授倘若仍祗以倫敦大學政治學敎授的身分而發出上項的談話，則書生談政，或離實際較遠，原無足奇，可是他是英國工黨的主席，而英國工黨是英國現在執政的黨，他自己本人蹤不直接參加艾德禮的政府，惟其是身居工黨主席，有所言行，一方面當有若干成分反映政府的意向，另一方面又可影饗政府的政策，因而上項的談話也就爲世人所注意。上面這一段談話，原可分爲兩部分：（一）關於新造原子彈的威力問題，（二）關於原子能之發展保持秘密政策問題。對於第一部份，已有美國參議院原子能特別委員會委員哈特及美機以原子彈轟炸長崎時在塲任官方觀察員之齊夏爾上尉加以駁斥，謂爲完全不確，我們無須有所申述。惟對於原子能之發展，應否保持秘密政策這一問題，願抒所見。</p>
<p>從科學發展的歷史言，任何一種科學的新奇發明，其秘密不能歷久保持。原來所謂科學上的新發明，其發明也決不偶然，却基於累次發明的堆積。例如：沒有無綫電的發明，就不會有雷達的發明。原子能利用的發明，亦不是一朝一夕的事，而是許多對於原子能發叫積聚的結果。利用了這些對於原子研究的結果，於是製造出了原子炸彈。關於原子炸彈的理論，科學家都可以說得出來，這並沒有秘密可言。製造原子炸彈的技術，在英美加三國協同努力之下，却完成於美國。所以關於原子能的秘密，不是在它的理論，而在它製造上的技術；這是一個技術上的秘密。旣然是一個按術上的秘密，也等於其它工商秘密一樣，似乎不應該看得太重。一個工業家有保持他工業上技術秘密的自由，也正不應該多所呌囂，一定要英美加公布其原子炸彈製造的秘密。邱吉爾以爲英美加之獲有原子炸彈製造的秘密是天賦的一種「神聖信託」，這似乎有些說得太「像煞有介事」，不免與從前西洋人到各殖民地去，自己鼓吹負有神聖使命一樣的裝點門面。但因爲英美加此時並無侵略的野心，不致發動侵略戰爭來利用原子炸彈摧毀人類文明，這是比較爲大家听認識。所以我們雖未必全部同意邱吉爾的言行，但多少還能信任這秘密如繼續保持在英美加手裏，對於人類的威脅總比較落在旁的地方安全。因之，對於拉斯基敎授所云，保持原子能發展的秘密爲「對於人類安寗之攻擊」一點，也就覺得費解。我們母寗說，保持原子能發展的秘密使不落於性好侵略之國家之手，實爲維護人類安寗之必要步驟。</p>
<p>中國正如英美加一樣，無侵略的野心。我們看到目前國際局勢的動盪，野心家猶復企圖以覇術統治天下，所以感覺到此際如將原子炸彈製造的技術秘密公布，倒足以威脅人類的安寗。這種足以摧毀人類文明的武力，如果落在一個企圖稱覇世界的國家，是其對於人類安寗將是一個如何嚴重的威脅。人類將不復再有自由，多數人將淪爲奴役。這眞是人類歷史上的一個重要關鍵！</p>

<h3>安理會激辯兩小時　蘇聯要求遭否決　葛羅米柯即席聲言不再參加辯論　下次會討論西班牙問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿四日廣播：廿五日安全理事會復將集議，討論弗朗哥西班牙問題，澳洲代表建議指派小組委員會審査弗朋哥是否威脅世界和平一案，可望通過。</p>
<p>（本報訊〕舊金山廿四日廣播：經過兩小時之激辯後，安全理事會昨日吾決蘇聯代表葛羅米柯再度請求將伊朗問題自程序中撤銷之提議。葛氏當即宣稱：不再參加對於此項問題之辯論。在開會前，葛即提出警吿，謂若安理會强制進行討論伊朗問題，或將引起極爲遺憾之後果。會議展開後，葛羅米柯即陳稱：前安全理會議決將伊朗問題延至五月六日討論，此項決議應即撤回。美代表史退丁紐斯聞言，立即起立反對，並引證聯合國秘書長賴依之審査意見（按賴氏曾表示安理會有權將伊蘇問題留入議程）。英澳代表對史氏之意見，表示贊同，荷蘭·中國·巴西及墨西哥亦表示反對蘇代表之見解。法代表建議將蘇伊問題延至九日間交由聯合國大會討論，亦遭否決。至此，葛羅米柯乃稱：蘇聯代表團認爲伊朗問題留置安理會議程內，實與憲章背道而馳，以後不再參加討論此項問題。安理會主席亞飛飛不待葛氏詞畢，即迅雷不及掩耳之方法宣佈討論另一問題（西班牙問題），因而阻止蘇代表退出會塲。當時蘇聯各代表均以目注視葛氏，以定去留，旋見葛氏呆坐未動，故亦安於原位，直至安理會休會始行散會。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約廿四日電〕聯合國安全理事會今日拒絕撤銷伊朗問題而使蘇聯遭遇新慘敗。初，安全理事會經二小時之激烈辯論後，由法國代表提出一決議，主張將伊朗問題自議程中撤銷，認爲業已解決，由聯合國機構秘書長賴依就發展情形作一報吿。葛羅米柯附議，主張表決。結果爲八票對三票遭推翻。當時贊成法國所提決議者，僅蘇，法，波三國，在理事會之十一票中，如得七票即屬大多數，故無需作反面之表次。由此可知七國代表團認爲必須將伊朗問題保留於議程上，直至蘇伊兩國於五月六日提出報吿，說明紅軍是否已遵照諾言如期撤退。安全理事會於下午十時〇五分休會（上海時間爲星期三上午十一時〇五分），至星期四下午三時（上海時間星期五上午四時）再開。其時，將考慮調査弗朗哥西班牙之建議。</p>
<h3>安理會中趣事　中蘇代表　諺言交談</h3>

<h3>改權角逐局勢複雜　日三黨未獲協議　社會黨爭首相席堅持不讓　日共黨宜布擱置反天皇制</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿四日電〕日本聯合政府組織問題之談判，今日益見複雜，但尙不能謂爲已瀕絕境。社會黨執委會公開宣布，須得首相一席，始允合作，否則聽任進步黨及自由黨主政，該黨寗願居於反對黨地位。政界方面現有一種傳說，以爲於茲政權角逐複雜局勢之中，自由黨總裁鳩山如因過去極端國家主義關係而被逐出政界，則前外相吉田有脫穎而出，繼之爲自由黨總裁可能。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿四日電〕日本政治領袖擬根據普選結果，組成聯合政府，今日繼續商談，惟殊少成就。日皇裕仁已飭人囑前首相幣原就自由進步與社會三大黨會談情形，隨時提出報吿。現社會黨堅欲在內閣中佔首相等重要職位，該黨秘書長片山今晚重申立塲，謂決不退讓。自由袖領黨河野與片山再度會談後稱，彼仍深信自由黨可與社會黨合作。彼又訪晤幣原，幣原曾鼓勵彼竭力爲之。幣原昨日出任進步黨總裁，現該黨似從旁觀者地位，觀望情勢進展。惟自由黨總裁鳩山之地位尙成一大問題，該黨在新國會所佔席數最多，故鳩山最有繼任首相之望。外傳麥帥總部對鳩山之資格問題，已向日政府有所說明，惟麥帥總部加以否認。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京廿四日專電〕傳日共黨秘書長德田表示，願意暫時擱置取消天皇制之政策，俾參加四黨之聯合政府。共黨過去要求取消天皇制，已使該黨與其他各黨間離，日共黨暫時擱置反天皇制陣綫一事，雖屬重要，然其人數過少，不足轉移日本政局。</p>

<h3>日普選報告發表　麥帥認日本民主獲有進展對外界指摘言論一舉廓清</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿四日電〕麥帥今日接閱關於日本普選之報告書，並發表聲明稱：『日本人民在此次選舉中，反對極端派，選擇中央派，以爲此輩最能爲民服務，此種趨勢殊極明顯。日本人民並已放棄固有哲學理論，認爲以前所經騐者，無非「統制民衆與禁止人類自由」耳，由此可知民主政治在日本已表現其健全的進展。日本人民獲得機會，解除數十年來軍閥之桎梏，對於自由表示之變遷，自願誠心響應。林肯總統嘗有言曰，「人民較統治者尤爲賢明」，日本人民自不能例外。』報吿書中承認共黨關於選舉名上漏去多人並被禁止投票之責難，但謂剝奪選舉權者，不及選民總數千分之四。大部份因於去年十一月以來遷居，未將姓名報入新住處，但即使有此情形，儘可用郵遞方式投票，但此輩並未出此。日內務省對於此事，正在澈底調査，但無論如何，此輩遺漏者即使參加投票，亦不致變更選舉結果。同時，婦女參加選舉之踴躍，殊出意外，其成績殊不遜於男子。婦女競選者，無政黨組織爲其聲援，其當選殆因屬於女性，始獲得女界方面之擁護。麥帥聲明並稱，『純粹的民主，乃天生的一種精神性質，必須從人民意志中油然而生，然後成爲根深蒂固之制度，不可强迫灌注。日本人民獲得自由發揮其民意之　　，即衷心嚮往，反對左右兩　端派，根據經騐所得，此兩極端派不免殊途同歸，其結果無非統制民衆與禁止人類自由而已。彼等所採取者乃廣大之中央派，俾使其政府推行平衡之施政方針，爲人民利益，盡其最善之服務，民主由此表示其健全的進展。議會中當選議員應不負選民所託，發揮健全的與建設性的立法，庶使民主節節推進，有厚望焉。』</p>
<p>各當席數</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿四日電〕麥帥今日宣稱：日本初次民主選舉，投票者達二千七百萬人以上，佔選民總數百分之七十三，以前最高紀錄不過一千一百廿五萬人，女議員當選者卅八人。各黨最後常選結果如下：自由黨一百卅九席，進步黨九十三席，社會民主黨九十二席，無然派八十三席，各小黨三十八席，協同黨十四席，共產黨五席，缺席二（該二席候選人未獲最低限度票數）。</p>
<p>競選費用</p>

<h3>聯合國機構的幾點錯誤</h3>
<p>— 本報倫敦特約記者　徐鐘珮</p>
<p>在我握筆時，日內瓦正在舉行國際聯盟的第二十一次大會。會塲裏，沒有三十四會員國的國旗飄揚，旁聽席上，悄然無人。——一切舖張陳設，已非必要，這批代表，是來舉行葬禮的。</p>
<p>就在這種凄凄戚戚的環境裏，主席赫勃羅致辭：國聯所移交給聯合國大會的，不特是一筆偌大家財，而且是「二十五年來累積的寳貴經騐。」</p>
<p>其實，與其說是經騐，還不如說是一串悲悲喜喜的記憶。道些記憶裏：有消失的崇高理想，有漸行漸遠的美麗希望，有寬佑墨索里尼的霍爾（前英外相）賴伐爾協定，有犧牲捷克的慕尼黑會議，還有中國對日本在東九省行爲的控訴。</p>
<p>回想當年，日內瓦車水馬龍，威爾遜爲着一點理想，竟不惜奔走呼號，以至於死。他如九泉有知，看國聯的終結，聯合國的誕生，該是悲是喜？看着這偉大理想實行機構的生生滅滅，該感慨該傷心！</p>
<p>赫勃羅說：「國聯雖死，它的火炬却移交給一個更年青更有力的手裏。」</p>
<p>聯合國大會是否更有力？聯合國大會是否肯應用國聯的廿五年經騐？—一切人類的將來都寄託在這兩個問題的解答裹。</p>
<p>聯合國機構自有它的沖天壯志，但在行動上，却和國聯一樣，也是在現實的團結裏徘徊。</p>
<p>第一，在這以平等爲基礎的憲章裏，居然充分表現着强權政治的色彩。中、英、美、法、蘇五國，雖然每國都只有一個投票權，可是在安全理事會裏，五强可以不經公舉就自任爲常任理事。（規定在憲章第二十三條裏面），非常任理事任期有期限，有調動，常任理事則一經上任，只變動人選，不變動國籍。而且第二十七條第三項又規定：「安全理事會對於其他一切事項之決議，應以七理事國之可決票，包括全體常任理事會之同意票表決之。」意思就是任何決議，只要所謂五强中有一强不贊成，就通不過。第一百零八條又規定：「本憲章之修正案，經大會會員國三分之二表決，並由聯合國會員同三分之二，包括安全理事會全體常任理事國，各依其憲法程序批准後，對於聯合國所有會員國發生效力」。這就是說：如果五强中有一强不同意，憲章就無法修正。</p>
<p>於是，五强中假使有一强搖頭，執行世界和平機構的聯合國大會就得束手。安全理事會可以用兵，但直屬它的軍事參謀會議也只許五强參謀長參加。</p>
<p>就這樣的，五强精神統治着聯合國大會。倫敦每日郵報上有一幅漫畫，畫蘇聯代表葛羅米柯去聯合國大會開會，帶了一項「强權政治」的帽子，貝爾納斯站在一旁縐眉，貝文雙手一攤說：「對不起，先生，請你把帽子放在衣帽間裏」。蘇聯當然是戴錯了帽子。但，怨誰呢？聯合國大會憲章上，並沒有禁止他（甚至鼓勵他）戴這頂帽子進塲。</p>
<p>聯合國大會的第二點錯誤是：它的假定戰勝國都是愛好和平國家。這點假定是致命傷。我們只能希望，痴痴的希望，一切戰勝國都愛和平，却決不能武斷的下此假定。希特勒墨索里尼和日本軍閥惹事生非，自然是罪魁禍首，但旣至必戰，決勝負於疆塲，勝利的因素是武器，是工業，是技術，決不是理想，決不是主義，更決不是一點愛好和平的至誠。常識吿訴我們，戰勝國決不等於愛好和平國家，更何况歷史可以帮我們解釋。「列强」「帝國主義」等的帽子曾經出現過在「戰勝國」頭上，如果記憶猶新，一九三九年蘇聯還曾經因爲侵略芬蘭被國聯開除。</p>
<p>同樣的，我們高呼再敎育，高呼消弭戰事，後一代無罪，爲什麽在千百萬年和平寳典的憲章上，要苦苦的把「敵國」規定在條款上。第五十三條，規定「敵國係指第二次世界大戰中爲本憲章任何簽字國之敵國而言」。在我們的終極理想裏，天下一家，何苦要現在結下這瀰天大仇。</p>
<p>聯合國大會的第三個錯誤，是不普遍。敵國當然無法參預，連從未動過侵略邪念的永久中立國瑞士，瑞典，也被摒棄在和平的設計圈外，保加利亞，南斯拉夫，奧地利，葡萄牙等歐洲國家，也全然無份。和平旣是不可分，爲什麽請柬未發及這些國家？葡萄牙代表已在口出怨言，認爲國際法庭不能算是完善的法庭，因爲有許多國家，未能參加這次國際法官的遴選</p>
<p>在第一屆聯合國大會席上，法國代表也說過歐洲國家代表的稀少。集思廣益，像那些永久中立國，才可以算是最最愛好和平的國家。</p>
<p>國聯移交聯合國時，又發生了不少問題，國聯一切費用由國聯會員國分攤，這樣，國聯全部財產無條件的移交聯合國，是否等於非法搶刧了那些非聯合國會員的國聯會員國？在精神上這是否等於剝奪了它們對和平理想的追求？</p>
<p>火炬已經由國聯移到了聯合國大會，可担心的倒不是外界的風風雨雨，而是怕執火炬的自已把它就近吹熄。　四月十日夜於倫敦</p>

<h3>世界糧食普遍缺乏　聯總對我國要求　未能如數供給　蔣延黻向報界報告出席國際救濟總署大會經過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行政院善後救濟總署署長蔣廷黻氏，此次代表我國出席第四屆國際善後救濟總署大會，方於廿二日返抵本市。昨日下午三時，特假都城飯店招待本市新聞界，出席中外記者四十餘人。首由該署編譯處長沈惟泰氏致簡短介紹詞，蔣氏即起立稱，此次第四屆國際聯總大會，可說是一個糧食會議。按去秋本人曾估計，我國在本年度內，需稻米與小麥各一百萬噸。經「聯總」審査後，稻米與小麥核减爲谷七十二萬噸。本年第一季「聯總」已有小</p>
<p>十八萬噸運送我國，惟稻米迄無絲毫運到。此中問題有二：一即全世界糧食普遍缺乏，二即糧食分配，係田美英加所合組之聯合糧食分配委員會，執掌其事。該會對我國糧食之分配，數量極少。例如美國出口米糧三十萬噸，分配與我國者僅佔此數十分之一。暹羅出口米糧十六萬噸，分配予我國者僅一萬八千噸。揆厥原因：（一）因該會認我國爲農產國，糧食無虞匱乏。（二）尙未瞭解我國目前特殊之困難，諸如：（一）產米區之台灣，非惟無糧食剩餘，反需仰給亞洲大陸。（二）去年</p>
<p>湖南旱災收成僅得四成，湖南反成飢荒區。（三）戰時敵人所到之區，農田牲蓄多遭毀損，情形嚴重，故河北山東各地生產，均普遍减低。此次抵美後，曾與各國洽議對我糧食分配問題。本年第二季中，可望有稻米十二萬噸運到我國。小麥運來之數量，迄今尙未確定。惟糧食問題，性質原屬多方面的，一面固需「聯總」及各國協助，一面國內仍須極力增產。目前可做者：（一）各大都市（尤指上海）應厲行</p>
<p>節約糧食運動。普通人民不致糟耗糧食，而都市之殷富階級，糟耗特多。故本人抵滬後，即建議政府，火速施行强制節約糧食辦法。（二）糧食之運輸及分配，端賴各方面多多合作。對糧食之運輸，尤需賦予優先權。俾糧食能由各海口，儘速運到各災荒地區分配救濟。蔣氏復分別答覆各記者所提問題：（一）各地糧食增產，正積極計劃推進中。「聯總」將陸續有各項農田器材，及化學原料運來。（二）「聯總」在亞洲工作之日期，原定明年三月底爲止，茲以事實需要，或將</p>
<p>考慮延長（三）「聯總」遠東區委員會開會日期，已定爲本年六月七日，地點在我國。（四）「行總」之救濟工作，廣及中國境內一般受災之難民，無分畛域，國籍，宗敎，或黨派信仰。（五）「聯總」在我國善後救濟工作之經費，我國當初希望爲美金九萬四千五百萬元，幾經折衝，現可望維持在美金五萬六千萬元以上。（六）預計我國恢復戰前糧食生產情形，至少須遲至民國卅七年方有端倪。</p>
<h3>龐次長談救濟糧荒　應推行節食運動</h3>
<p>糧食部次長龐松舟，昨日下午接見記者稱：救濟糧荒首應推行節食運動，希望全國各省市，依照地方環境而實行。關於糧貨問題乃試辦性質，如第一批結束後本市食糧確能達價格穩定，存底豐富之良好成績，則將舉辦第二次，擬推廣至皖贛產米地區。至於此次貸款糧商十七家，將來有無繼續希望一點，則全視其成績如何爲依歸。龐氏本人對於本市糧食價格前途，極端願望，不久縮回至三萬元大關。此外龐氏聲稱：採購洋米，以補不足一項，已請新由美返國之蔣廷黻氏向聯合國建議允許我國派員在緬甸西貢仰光一帶，自由採購，如經同意，當即實施云。</p>
<h3>專運食米之美輪第一艘月底到滬</h3>
<p>（本報訊）勝利後美國協助軍公運輸，以及救濟品燃料等，不斷運輸。又因我國缺乏糧食，美國非常關切，除大量麥子麵粉運來外，又擬加派船舶，行駛南洋一帶，專事運輸食米。今據美國總統輪船公司稱，今由美國戰時船舶管理處委託，撥派福特號輪四艘，行駛香港·蘇門搭臘·新加坡·暹羅·上海·之間，第一艘福特惠赫墨（譯音）說，已由舊金山起程，約月底可到滬，定下月三日自滬運商品駛南洋，由暹羅·蘇門搭臘·等處運米來滬。該項船雙，約三千餘噸，可載貨二千噸。</p>
<h3>財部京滬特派員辦公處月底結束</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據財政部京滬區財政金融特派員辦公處負責人語記者：該處即將於本月底辦理結束。溯該處自去年九月間奉派處理京滬地區財政金融事務，迄已七月有餘，工作難　繁，惟工作人員極少；七個月中用去經費，亦僅四千餘萬元。舉其工作之犖犖大者，有（一）財政機關之接收。（二）敵性金融機構之接收與整理。（三）僞金融機構之接收與淸理。（四）協助外商銀行接收被刦之資產。（五）商營金融機構之整理。（六）保險公司之整理。（七）收換僞中儲券。（八）協助消弭罷工風潮與工廠復工貸款。（九）票據交換制度之改進。（十）督促國營行局設立分支機構。（十一）緊急處置出口貨物結匯問題等。</p>
<h3>舶來糖果餅幹充斥·我廠商將盡陷絕境</h3>
<p>本市糖果餅乾罐頭麵包商業同業公會，以近日迫來品糖果餅乾充斥市上，影響營業，長此以往，將使全國糖果餅乾廠商盡陷絕境。該會全體廠商特於前日召開會議，一致議決呈請政府設法保護。請將糖果一項，列入奢侈品類，禁止進口。提高進口餅　稅率或加征奢侈稅。</p>

<p>該會自成立至前日上午止，共收到各機關申請書三百在十餘件，房屋業主登記者六十餘件。</p>
<p>敵產房屋計一千餘幢，將由敵僞產業處理局處理公開標賣，標賣辦法，現正擬具中。</p>
<p>又本市盟僑房屋的計三千餘幢，亦須於四月三十日前向分配會辦理登記，經該會審核後，除業主必需自用者外，多餘房屋，均由該會分配出租。收入房租，仍交還業主，不得由業主私自出頂。聞洋商方面，昨日上午特舉行會議，商討此事。</p>

<h3>方稚周上校　報告菲僑胞情况　至少有萬餘人死於非命望政府團結爲僑胞後盾</h3>

<p>新中國報爲先總理於民國三的時所手創，爲當地兩大黨報之一，日人佔領期閱，該報機器被搬一空，編輯人員多遭拘禁，該報董事長及編輯三人，因此先後亡故。光復後，業於去年雙十節復刋。菲地華僑義勇軍，爲華僑國民黨部所領導組織。戰時除在菲京從事地下情報聯絡工作外，並在山頂對日寇展開游擊戰。設有電台與澳洲連絡，直接受美西南太平洋司令部指揮，與菲軍游擊隊合作。後復協助</p>

<h3>香汛寄語　「借佛遊春」上杭州</h3>
<p>— 廿日通訊　本報特派員儲裕生寄</p>
<p>香汛到了，「借佛遊春」上杭州來的人摩肩接踵。</p>
<p>滬杭車，班班都客滿，擠得水洩不通，鐵路當局爲了適合需要起見，特別加開一次火車，又加開了一次汽油火車，但是火車票總是在車子還沒有開出的前一天已經售完了。這裏包括着各種不同的人，此較貧苦的，他們要上杭州，於是坐四等車或三等車，比較富庶的人，他們也要上杭州，坐的是頭二等車，原來他們都和杭州——西湖八年沒有見面了。在勝料後的今天，自然要高高興興「要子兒」一番。</p>
<p>（一）利市三倍</p>
<p>在杭州此時，最高興的當然是旅館和吃食店，你跑遍全杭州各個旅館，都掛着客滿的脾子，有的遊客要求搭一隻舖，但旅館主人回答「搭舖的地方部沒有了」。因此，旅館的房價漲得驚人，一萬，五千一晚的都是極普通的價錢。早上，中午，晚上，吃食店也都宣吿客滿，有很多客人站着等這一桌上的客人吃完，好自已也坐下去吃。吃食店裏的跑堂聲音也喊嘶了，賬房的算盤不停的在響着。有一個杭州朋友的略估計，大槪每天要吃掉一萬條魚，五千斤　家鄕肉。原來杭州的魚顯荳腐和家鄕南肉都是極有名的。幾條衝要的市街，如靠近湖濱的延齡路，如熱鬧商市的三元坊·淸泰路·新民路·迎紫路等，各家店舖，都在爭奇鬥勝，霓虹燈別出心裁，無綫電播送紹興的篤戲，却很少有上海歌詠的。幾家舞廳喧囂達於戶外。杭州土產沙桃·香榧·藕粉·茶葉每天都銷售一空。尤其是延齡路，直到深晚十二時店家還敝着大門，播送着無綫電的音樂。</p>
<p>划子和黃包車·小汽車行·轎子莫不利市三倍，划子據說每天可以賺到兩萬塊錢，黃包車伕每天可以賺到一萬五千元，小汽車出租，每小時一萬二千元，公共汽車雖然便宜，但車身是卡車，乘客們拼命往上擠，變成了「沙丁魚」。轎子生意也不差，每天每個轎夫也可賺到一萬元。</p>
<p>（二）兩種遊客</p>
<p>遊各可以分爲兩種，一種是來自田間的農胞，他們穿着靑布襖，有的女子還繫着紅裙子，每個人都背着黄布袋，手裏套着唸珠，捧着長香，匆匆地從馬路上通過，朝山進香去。另一種是來自都市的。西裝革履的男士，和打扮得花枝招展的女士們，有的女士也穿着中國式的短襖，但跨着長西裝褲，朝山進香的農胞們總會對她們望幾眼。這些來自都市的男女，他們不慣走路的，但是上枕州來，總得要登山爬嶺，他們脚下穿的革履是絕對不適宜爬山的。聰明的商人們製作一種空花的布鞋，和草編的凉帽，向遊客們兜售，每個都市來的男女幾乎都買了布鞋與凉帽。他們穿戴在首足上，表示異常得意的神氣。</p>
<p>（三）送往迎来</p>
<p>和尙們，他們向香客們迎來送夫，拿出黃簿子，要客人們修功積德。人總願意吉祥的，凡去寺院玩的人很少有吝嗇而不解囊的。靈隱寺的羅漢殿燬於火，現在要重建了。飛來峯的一綫天，一個和尙用長竹竿指给遊客們看，看後就伸出手來向遊客們叫「阿彌陀佛」。玉泉寺的五色魚，寺內人捧出一盆盆切成薄片的壤山芋，逗魚爭食，但結果也要遊客們賞賜一些。韜光，天竺更要遊客們許許願心，可以將來飛黃騰達。</p>
<p>（四）和尚「悟」了</p>
<p>凈慈寺的大殿歪了，很多人爲这雄偉的大殿躭心，和尙捧出緣簿，要你寫一些宏願。運木井已經燒掉的了，但現在还是運木井，人們雖明知道是假的，而還一本正經的吿訴不知道的人：「這是當年濟顚僧由井中運本來造凈慈寺大殿的」。</p>
<p>六和塔正在要修寺殿，石屋洞也在要修六角亭，石屋洞的一個和尙說：「我們沒有什麽廟產，僅靠後邊一片荒山」。另一個和尙說：「做和尙做到今天，不能再空吃白食了，應該盡一些勞力，以勞力來換取生存的代價，這才是人生的意義」。一套理論，振振有詞，和尙眞的「悟」了。</p>
<p>（五）西湖划子</p>
<p>西湖裏，划子之多，爲八年來所少見，但據划子說，還只比得戰前的一半，三潭印月是每個遊客必去的地方，那裏照相館的店員們弄得手忙脚亂。湖心亭的遊客也擁擠不堪。</p>
<p>在裏西湖著名的樓外樓，太和園兩家菜館，他們的菜價也是著名的貴，但是遊客們如果不嚐一下樓外樓的菜肴醇酒，是等於白來杭州一趟的。</p>
<p>在杭州的馬路上，看見各種服飾不同外鄕來的香客，這裏至少也帶幾分爭奇鬥姸。</p>
<p>以往平時杭州市的大宗收入，是靠春秋的香汛的，現在可惜無法統計到底有多少人多少錢在這香汛期中投資到杭州市的身上。</p>
<p>人們是健忘的，八年來的創痛，和今後的資任，在遊覽杭州時，一切都給拋諸腦後了。</p>

<h3>在熱的威脅下　港僑喘息</h3>
<p>— 廿日航訊　本報特約記者　林友蘭</p>
<p>打開國內寄來的報紙，最近還可以看到冰塊·棉襖·火爐………等詞句，但在香港，已開始感受夏之驕陽的熱力了。夏裝早已上市，女人穿起雪白「沙士堅」的長外套，招搖過市。百貨公司的大櫉窗上，掛起標價每碼三十五元的英國麻布，白鳧皮鞋趕走了黑皮的和黃皮的同伴，獲得主人的賞識。慣於（享樂的人正在担心如何渡過暑天，政府因爲決心依照原定計劃把北角的海灘塡平，建築堆棧，封閉昔日的海浴區。若到遠離市區的海灘去游泳汽車旣不够分配，渡海小輪也缺乏，聽說那些海灘還遺下若干掃除不淸的地雷，金玉之軀有誰情願去冒如此不測之險？想來想去，還是最少不得一個電氣冰箱，但舊的多已毀壞了，新的還未有運到，眞是傷腦筋。</p>
<p>新裝換季</p>
<p>談何容易</p>
<p>然而，眞正傷腦筋的，却是一般受薪階級。一套最蹩脚的白斜布西裝，至少也要港幣一百二十塊。海防布的，一百八十塊，英國的Tootal麻比劣質的薄絨更値錢，非四百元休想動念。穿「夏威夷裝」吧，最便宜的一件也要四五十元。領帶每條五元起碼，花式新鮮的，索價十元以上。中裝方面呢，普通的柳條布，已有本港復員工廠織製的新貨上市，每碼五元至七元。新衣一襲，連工包料，亦非三四十元不辦。受　階級每月百元左右的收入，新裝「換季」眞是談何容易！</p>
<p>香島十年</p>
<p>物價比較</p>
<p>季節更換，社會的事物也跟着變動起來：電費增價了，水費增價了，公價物品漲價了，渡海小輪也增價了，聽說電車已準備增收票價，那麽，公共汽車看來也一定不甘落後。糧價雖還未有暴漲，但牠已漲至可驚的程度。據半官方發表的統計數字，最近香港的糧價已比十年前高漲十四倍半。香港居民一般的收入，至多也不過比十年前提高四五倍。其中痛苦，不言可喩。十年前，即是日本發動侵略我國戰事的開始，那時，內地的人民紛紛遷港避居，糧價便隨供應關係開始上漲。茲將各項分列如下，以見一班：</p>
<p>本年三月　一九三七年</p>
<p>類別　價格（港　三月價格元單位）</p>
<p>白米（每斤算）一·　·七</p>
<p>豬肉　三·五　·三五</p>
<p>牛肉　三·六　·二五</p>
<p>魚　二·二　·二</p>
<p>糖　二·八　·七</p>
<p>柴　·一　·一五</p>
<p>鹽　·二五·〇一</p>
<p>菜蔬　·四五　·〇三</p>
<p>咸魚　三·　·一一五</p>
<p>茶　四·八　·四</p>
<p>蛋（每隻計）　·二　·〇一五</p>
<p>公價食物</p>
<p>供應西人</p>
<p>最近，香港的伙食費，每人每月至少四十元，那祇是最節儉的中國菜，也是勞工局爲一般工人預算的數字。外國人照例可以買到公價食物，新鮮的，罐頭的，在家裏應有盡有，政府都替他們多方籌措，供應不斷。所以，一個「大班一在家裏的伙食費，算來和他的僕歐或車夫的相差不多，但他朝魚晚肉，咖啡牛油，吃得腦滿睗肥，他的下人却靑菜淡飯，聊以果腹，這個妙算，眞是虧得安居倫敦的「英內閣遠東救濟復興小組委員會」的大人先生想得出來。</p>
<p>蚊子亂飛</p>
<p>老鼠跳樑</p>
<p>天氣一天比一天的熱，蚊子滿天飛，（戰前香港是以沒有蚊子，夏天用不着掛帳見稱的。）虐疾流行，鼠子也特別多。倫敦方面派來一位捕鼠專家，進行殺鼠運動，當局連日又勸告居民注射防疫針。香港的僑胞正在夏熱的壓迫下喘息不休的活着。</p>

<h3>善後救濟總署贛分署　推行農村急救　分派工作隊擴大工作地區及範圍</h3>
<p>— 十九日南昌通訊　李國華寄</p>
<p>江西全省八十三縣，其中就有六十多縣被敵蹂躪，僥倖得免的，祗有十餘縣。贛北如彭澤，湖口，瑞昌，星子，等縣，於廿七年夏，相繼淪陷。二十八年敵沿南潯鐵路，逐縣侵擾，九江，永修，武寗，德安，修水，等縣，先後淪陷。省區南昌，也於是年被敵佔據。二十八，二十九兩年中，贛湘邊境之戰，如萍鄕，高安，上高，敵我爭奪甚烈，破壞極大。卅一年浙赣鐵路沿綫之戰，敵我屢進屢退，旋得旋失，敵騎所至，村落蕩然。如上饒，玉山，廣豐，貴谿，橫峯，戈陽，等縣，損失極鉅。卅三年，敵由西之蓮花，永新，竄入南之泰和，吉安，贛縣，等縣，燒殺刧掠，應有盡有。卅四年贛南之敵，復沿北竄，雖爲時不久，而燒殺至慘。</p>
<p>烽火連年　敵騎大肆蹂躪</p>
<p>連年烽火，無時或熄，更以贛西北各縣被敵大肆破壞，盤據達七年之久。各項損失，直不可以數字計。房屋方面：就南昌市而論，原有門牌三七·六七九號，被燬的已達二六·九五八號。現存的，計一〇七二一號。其損失竟在百分之七十以上。換言之，現存的房屋，不及戰前的三分之一。而這剩下的一成，又多殘破不堪，剝落沸全，且多失却本來的面目了。他如九江，德安，星子，永修，吉安，贛縣，上饒，高安，等縣，房屋的損失，均在百分之七十八以上。其他數十縣的損失，也在百分之六十以上。約計全省房屋的損失，當在卅九萬幢。無家可歸的人民，約有一百六十萬。他如衣着方面，無衣被者，約二百六十萬人。須部份救濟者，約二百卅萬人。因着房屋的破壞，老百姓也早就跑光了。八年來老年人和成人，被殺死，病死，甚至於餓死，當不在少數，兒童和嬰孩，缺乏吃和穿，死亡率當然很大。在這種情形之下，農田的荒蕪，自在意中，一時尙難得其槪數。就已査出者，贛北各縣，已在二百餘萬畝以上。贛西南各地，往往數十里內渺無人烟，簡直荒蕪得可驚。贛東雖是敵人盤據不久，收復較早，但因種種緣由，待耕的田，所在多有。至於各縣農村捐失的耕牛，其成分雖不盡同，而達過半數者，就有十一縣之多。其他各縣，缺乏的情形，正不相上下。贛省原多產稻之區，種籽一項，不致成問題，可是赤貧的農民，要出錢去買，就很艱難了。這種種都在江西分署工作的考慮之中。</p>
<p>農村急救　去冬試辦槪况</p>
<p>在去歲十月尾成立之初，就把農村緊急救濟，列爲即須舉辦的業務之一。於是在去年十二月上旬，選定了受害最深，爲禍最烈的地區，首先試辦。計分：南昌區，德安，星子，永修區，高安，上高區。救濟的目的：是協助復耕。救濟的對象：是業已回鄉（也是分署實助回鄉者）的赤貧農民及其眷屬。救濟的地區：是一片荒凉的農村。救濟的物資：是現款（購備建築材料）寒衣（散發）食鹽，食米，麵粉，（散放或以工代賑）種籽，農具。（散放），救濟的方式：是散放食物，和以工代賬。劫後的農村，是需要這樣的救濟，江西分署更本着迅速而確實的主旨做去。所謂迅速，就是馬上去做。所謂確實，就是要眞正交到老百姓手上，眞正使老百姓受到實惠。</p>
<p>上述一個地區的工作隊，在去歲十二月間，先後出發。先以調査，並召集當地士紳曁保甲長會議，決定一切進行步驟和方式。繼以實施，根據調査幷會議結果，迅速而確實地展開工作。南昌區（南昌市專案辦理除外）包括南昌縣屬之沙埠潭，萬舍，新村，幾個重點。這幾處，以前都是人烟稠密，屋字遞雲的大村莊。現在是一片荒蕪，極目無際，三十里以內，沒有一棟房屋，也看不見一個人。這一區緊急救濟的措施，分四部份：（一）建築農舍三種（竹架草蓋。（一）集體農舍。（二）單獨農舍。（三）協助農舍。）（二）散放棉衣，麵粉，農具，種籽。（三）以工代賑。（四）檢理屍骨。</p>
<h3>原定計劃　建茅舍八百棟</h3>
<p>分署原定的計劃，是建築茅舍八〇〇棟。以三百棟分配於南昌區，以二五〇棟分配於高安上高區。以二五〇棟分配於德安，永修，星子區。另建瓦屋農舍二〇〇棟，以八〇棟分配於南昌區。六〇棟分配於德安，永修，星子區。以六〇棟分配於高安上高區。此外，暫製棉衣三〇〇〇件，農具三〇〇〇套，（包括犁·鋤·鈀。）種籽五〇〇石，均交各該區分配。至耕牛，爲數甚大，需款尤鉅，另案請撥專款辦理。</p>
<p>截至目前止，南昌區的沙埠潭，萬舍，新村，三個重點，已建就了一二七棟農舍，發放了一〇〇〇件棉衣，九〇〇袋麵粉，檢埋了二七〇〇具屍骨，此外，還修建了三六座便橋。農舍之中，有共同居住之集體農舍，有帮助建成的協助農舍，也有個別居住的單獨農舍，種籽正待耕牛有着再發。</p>
<p>高安，上高區的災情和災區。經過了詳盡而周密的調査，已勘定下列九個救濟的重點，（一）高安方面，崇德鄕之熊家牆下，和章家，兩個重點，各建農舍二〇楝。（二）儀鳳鄕之奉大，和藕絲嶺，兩個重點，各建農舍四〇棟。（三）高郵鄉之昂溪，和公山，兩個重點，各雞農舍五〇棟。（四）祥符鄕之祥符山，和燕家山，兩個重點，各建農舍七〇棟。已經開始建築，進度甚速，最短期間，即可全部完成。寒衣，農具，種籽，也照實在情形散放。不過耕牛缺乏，尙待購備分配。</p>
<p>德安，永修，星子區的調査工作，除星子正在進行外，近已吿竣。各該縣的救濟重點，也經助定。德安的重點，是第一區之附城，烏石，兩處。永修的重點，是張公渡和楊家嶺，寒衣先行散放，茅屋也照預定的計劃，在興建中。</p>
<p>以上三個區的農村緊急救濟，均已次第舉辦，即可先後完成，三個月以前，　無一人，滿目荒凉的地區，現在才有房屋和人烟了。這些人正凖備着復耕的工作。他們歸來，就得着衣食住的救濟，這是他們衷心感激的。所以分派他們搬運材料，建築農舍的時候，他們都知道這是爲着他們，就十分起勁。他們做了一天的工作，都得食鹽·食米·或麵粉。每扛一根竹子，或一百束稻草，可得四兩食鹽。檢到一斤屍骨，可得一兩食鹽。如果參加集體農舍的建築，每天共分一斤食鹽，或三斤麵粉。這是分署以工代賬的方法，實惠也是在他們身上。因此，他們工作得很高興。有時高興過分，還邊做邊唱村歌。他們都異口同心的說：這是八年以來，第一次感覺到的快樂。講到檢埋屍骨，彀使他們傷心了。因爲這些頭顱和肢骨，不少是他們的父兄和兒女。慘遭屠殺，屍骨模糊，早已辨別不出了。</p>
<h3>劃十五區　每區設工作隊</h3>
<p>江西分署試辦農村急救，有了成效，認爲有擴大和普遍的必要，而且整個業務的開展，也就從這一項偉大的工作開端。於是，在本年二月下旬，把全省受災的六十縣”劃爲十五個區。每區設一工作隊，每個工作隊包含三縣至七縣。</p>
<p>這十五個工作隊，（除南昌區外）隊長的人選，幾經物色和考慮，才行決定。因爲這種工作，是極其艱鉅的，必須有服務的精神，智能的素養，才能勝任愉快。現在人選旣妥，籌備已經就緒，業已先後出發，分頭猛進。至於工作的方針，及其組織和業務項目，農村緊急救濟，是主要的項目—另有詳細而具體的規定，因不屬本篇範圍，當俟另篇報道。（四，十三）</p>

<p>如何競選市參議員？</p>
<p>主筆先生：本市將在四月廿八選舉第一屆市參議員，這是實踐民主的重要步驟，也是最好的一個民意測騐。可是根據廿日本報專載，本市三百卅萬市民僅得一千餘甲種公職候選人，爲什麽在這高呼民主自治時候，市民對競選仍感不到興趣？我想除「時間不够充裕」「宣傳不够透澈」兩點可能的說法外，還是事實表現的不够眞切。現在距離選舉日期很近了，參與競選的候選人，照理應當在各自的選區裏努力發揚他們的眞才實學，政見思想，爭取優勢選民的信任和擁戴。可是截至執筆時止，眞照這樣做的還是寥寥無幾。採取「講交情帮忙」「請客拉攏」方法的倒很踴躍。假定這一屆市參議一部分，眞是照後者的方法爭取得來，那末離開「民主」還是很遠。何况這筆請客浪費的驚人，一些沒顧到大衆的憔悴，災區的哀號。我想有眞知灼見遠大目光的競選人決不肯如此做法。感慨所及，嚴本春秋責備賢者之意，請效盟邦自由競選的精神，憑政見學識來號召，而節省請客的費用去贊助尊師運動或救災工作，豈不更好？闕逸凡上廿一日。</p>
<p>私校增收學費問題</p>
<p>主筆先生：讀貴報所載尊師運動極佩美意，惟對窮學生似尙未加考慮體恤。茲謹擬意見數則懇請登載，（一）公私立學校均是培育靑年，公立學生旣可免加學費，何以私立獨要增收一倍？（二）私立學生家庭，貧富不齊，貧者爲子弟勉籌學費，喘息未定，忽又續加一倍，自無此力量。（三）聞私校自謂增收一倍並非募捐，不知實際有等於勒捐之嫌，尤非淸寒子弟所能堪。（四）爲家長者孰不望子弟學業有成，設因無力續繳，是吾即應停學？（五）設因此而停學，所有許多遊手子弟有無走歧途之可慮？學校有無補救之策？（六）各私校之熱心苦詣，各敎師之努力育才，固所深佩。可吾另想善法，或自由募捐？富者囊槖有餘，多納不碍，貧者薪米不繼，聽其自然。（七）或更一面請政府體此苦情，酌加津貼，使知學校師生並非勞資關係，窮敎師固等於苦力者，其奈苦學生非資本家何。政府亦須稍爲體恤，以期敎育之普及而免淸寒之向隅。葉　公上。</p>

<h3>戰後師範生　延長服務年期</h3>

<p>特稿</p>
<h3>台省敎育動態</h3>
<p>— 本報台灣特派員　暮雲</p>
<p>台灣省的敎育，在行政長官署敎育處的策劃下，現正着着推進茲分別報吿如次：</p>
<p>台大風潮解決　最高學府的台灣大學附屬醫院的風潮，從上月廿二日起到本月十一日才吿解決。起因是一部份助產醫生向學校當局請求發給委任書，其中並有少數無　給者要求改爲有蔪，結果雙方堅持，弄成僵局，大門口高貼「向病者對不起」的通吿，馬路上到處都是「打倒包辦制度」「我們願做科學革會的七十二烈士」的標語，開台省高等敎育罷課罷診的新風氣。待羅校長返台後、召集兩院代表答應所提要求，他支持民主化，於是軒然大波，始吿平息。</p>
<p>國語普及困難　以國語替代日本話的運動，因政治不能迅速開展，影響了普及。敎育處在滬招聘的九十六位國語敎員，經過一個星期的訓練，已分派到各省立中小學敎習，但以人員不夠，不數分配。事實上倒是軍隊帮助了國語的普及推行。台北的七十軍政治部，已訓練了兩班學員，而一般小學因爲敎員都是本省人，能夠用簡單的國語敎援，已感匪易。台北縣屬七區內有十九個青年修煉所，其中一所在士林鎮被指定爲國語推行的所址，以符合敎育處一縣一所的規定，但到現在尚未開班。台中自去冬十二月初由國軍將全市的國語講習班由十八班擴展到二十四班，學員二千人增至三千人，現在則銳减到市區內原有二三十人一班的，僅存七八人，數目减到三分之二之上。台南的中華日報嚴重地指出，這是可怕的低潮。</p>
<p>國民學校難題　作爲實施强迫敎育的國民學校，校舍大部被駐軍隊，警備司令部已通知各軍隊於十五日前遷出，可望解決了一個難題。以台北縣論，原有國民學校一三五所，最多的學級是二八到三十學級，像宜　的礁溪瑞芳的九分國民學校是。目前各校能容留的學生只有十分之三到七，這是一般的現象。校長和重要敎員過去都是日人，他們走了，由本省人担任，敎員數打了個大折扣，而以經費不能按時發放，大部抑給於家屬的獲校團和後援會，於是外省來的敎員，天天作歸計，本省人也叫苦連天。</p>
<p>陳情書大流行　敎育界對當局「嘆願」和提出「陳情書」，大見流行，有些是用手指血捺印的「血判狀」。像台中市大屯區的全省孤苦學者大會，爲了請求認定資格，向縣當局「陳情」後，更派代表到長官公署提出「陳情書」；台化私立的土木測量學校，因爲經費沒有着落，且要求改爲公立，更以七十二個學生和敎職員聯名上「血判狀」，這情形在各縣市普遍地流行着。</p>
<p>高山敎育停頓　侷處於高山地帶的熟審高山族（即高砂族）在台北縣境共有二十二社，約七千六百人，過去日本人在這裏開辦十五個敎育所，實施同化政策，敎員都是有武力的，警官純粹是壓迫性的敎育。自從日人去後，這部份學校全部停頓了，因爲地瘠民貧，又以環境關係，沒有人願夫。台北縣曾招聘有志於高山族的敎育工作者，結果應徵的只有幾個不是辦敎育的敎育工作者。現在敎育處限本月底辦竣督導改進高山族各國民學校，想當有具體積極的辦法。</p>
<p>崇師之風未衰　台灣過去以受日本敎育之故，崇師之風，到現在還未衰落。記者曾去新竹省立商業職業學校參觀，據王校長吿，學生們崇敬師長的好風尙，國內是沒有的。不但看見師長要敬禮，即低年級看見高級的同學也要立正。小偸甚並要偸軍隊的東西，而不拿學校裏的物品，敎師看電影和上酒館（以大部酒館爲胡調之所）是被家長看不起的，環境把他們的生活約束起來，而敎師所處的地位，却是高超的，等於當地的權威的士紳。他很高興地說：我已是接收後的第五個校長，學生們國語已經能聽得懂，每天早晚升旗唱黨歌訓話，日本的侵略性的歌曲和穿木　是被禁止的。學生們都想過做官據，剛畢業的一班三十多個學生，有十九個被介紹到市政府去。</p>
<p>神社改民敎館　敎育處對本省日人的神社命令改爲民衆敎育館，或紀念館。台北縣有十一個神社，現在正計劃着改組起來。民敎館長派下來了，但一切設備都沒有，而敎育經費在下年度的預算裏，必需支付的要四千餘萬，而照估計可以收入的稅額只有四五百萬，經濟上的困難，使社會敎育和學校敎育一樣，陷於兩難之境。臨遺散的和被徵用留着的日本人，他們明知頽敗的失了光輝的神社命運結束了，但是他們不改以往作風，路過時還在作深長的遙拜。</p>

<p>商業新聞</p>
<h3>在偵騎密佈之下　公債愈做愈熱　華股僅一小時買賣</h3>
<p>公債昨再現奇景，警局査禁更進一步。對形　可疑各房，嚴密偵訊，證交大樓七樓某號戶長等加以詳査後帶局査問，惟交易在東西湊集下，時斷時續，有等在室內進行，統內晨開時屈居六〇〇〇元光景，此後在大戶東區西藏下，交易愈做愈熱，中途復創六四〇〇元新高價，而後在六三〇〇元光景盤旋，結果較前收計丙種微升一〇〇元，雜牌甲乙在大戶套買中再漲三百元，戊升二百元，丁種因前日做價最廉，昨獨漲四〇〇元，華股僅一小時賣買，後即因紗布大樓某大戶遭便裝　佐査禁，並將負責人帶局詳究，其他各處亦有査察帳目之舉，聞風相繼停止賣買，暫　風頭，惟聞査帳後，零星喊價扳高少許，開後最高時永紗五一五〇元、美亞四二〇〇元，景福四二三元，內衣搜買者續湧，價最俏利，最後較前收計永紗等五熟均稍下跌，其他各股除中國內衣續升十元外，餘者升降互見，良以十時後全部停業、成交先後因時間關係，較有參差，難　一致也，外股亦在環境不利下，有所顧忌，各股均稍低落。</p>
<h3>取締證券黑市美鈔又成奇貨</h3>
<p>美鈔受報載五月份起駐華美機關藉津以美匯價結付國幣傳說，過敏者深恐此後美鈔來源，大爲减少，奇貨可居，激起買風，晨開雖平，一轉瞬間即跳高一百元，十時後股市停頓，盤旋之餘，再起漲風，最高達二三五〇元左右，而後略起圖風，午前一度退入二三〇〇元內，午後仍形乾涸，買戶不易獲得對手，喊價又漸扳高，結果較前收漲起一七〇元，對黃金軋攏至六八〇元對十兩，美匯掛牌仍平，銀行賣價仍在二〇六〇元光景，港電羅比仍吿平穩，港票新老亦帶好十元。</p>
<p>又訊，當局爲嚴密管制美鈔起見，將採取重要措施，並與在滬之美軍當局妥商合作辦法，於散發薪水之前，全部向我方兌換法幣，以免流人黑市，同時當局對黑市美鈔之買賣，亦將定嚴密取締辦法云。</p>
<h3>金價回漲</h3>
<p>烚赤昨形勢穩定，美鈔突又趨俏，助長金市買氣、午前曾迫近中行配給價，晨開平盤，開後受美鈔突然而來之刺激、激動買風，漸漸拉上，中行配給時在一五七萬五左右，十時後股市全部停頓，投機游資轉向，金市明美鈔之光，亦跟泓至一五九萬五，而後買戶有所顧忌，回落二萬餘，午刻在一五八萬光景徘徊，午後美鈔復堅，金市得其助力、稍稍回上，結果漲起三萬，飾金十六萬八，紋銀一千六，銀元一〇五〇元有賣，暗拆仍形鬆動，息價自一角至一角半。</p>
<h3>紗市漲風漸熾　念支紗走勢最俏利</h3>
<p>昨日紗市漲勢較盛，二十支雙馬在投機帮垂靑之下，忽跳七萬，其餘二二支大小型紗亦均好起一二萬，人心頗挺，目下紗市以二十支最爲俏利，蓋各帮所需要者均以二十支爲大宗，是以市上二十支現貨不拘大廠小型，俱有供不敷求之槪，况紡建對二十支紗供售極少，故其價一時殊不易回降，昨又屆紡建公司開售例期，價與上次相仿，惟另有九組紗綫，改用招標方式，由業中人出價競爭標買云。</p>
<h3>人造絲漲十萬　廠絲平穩綢貨大漲</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲買多於賣，售價直綫上升，一二〇號天橋開盤即昂，一百四十九萬元，旋復升至一百五十四萬元收　，下午略回小做五十二萬元，結果較隔日高達十萬元，半光漲起六七萬元，廠經價平穩如故，洋行貨毫無交易、普通五担貨同行做十天期票一百八十五萬元，十五天期票一百八十七萬元，綢貨交易，昨日甚繁，漲風亦厲，美亞被面每百條漲十萬元，大誠格子　　開盤每　三千五百六十元，後做高至七百二十元。</p>
<h3>現棉交易稍遜　市價上升一二千元</h3>
<p>昨日紐約美棉因假期停市，未有電訊，木埠現棉市况仍俏　惟交易稍遜，緣美鈔與紗價俱高，致廠家談判不易接近，故無成交，僅同業有六七百包交易，市價再升一二千元。</p>
<h3>呢羢交易稀少</h3>
<p>夏令呢羢，市貨流通缺乏，行情始終高挺，西服帮用戶本客各埠雖有需要，均以價格昂貴，實地成交無幾，春貨因銷日巳過大半，交易亦寡，秋冬黑貨，則賣買更少，呢羢市况形成擯局，無大上落。</p>
<h3>煤球門銷清淡　柴炭同陷疲滯</h3>
<p>煤球自各廠恢復生產以來，產品驟有增加，然煤球銷路因受液體燃料充斥，及平價白煤屑繼續發賣影響，各煤店門銷反趨清淡，各廠盤現雖仍維持原價，但暗中均另貼佣金以圖競爭，柴炭因辦本關係，到貨雖不多，但銷路亦受上述影響、陷於疲滯狀態，市價於軟檔盤旋。</p>
<h3>麵粉禁止交易　米價仍然堅挺　內地交通不便亦爲漲價原因</h3>
<p>麵粉自上週追隨米價騰高以後，連日猛漲不已，市政當局爲防止投機，安定民生起見。已於昨日禁止該項交易，本市雜糧油餅業市塲、亦以麵扮一項、不在該市塲買賣範圍以內，昨日佈吿停止塲內麵粉買志行爲。</p>
<p>糧貸商購運之米糧，近續到一千餘石，絡續尙有運到，據　署負責人談，此次貸款購糧之十五家中，（另已核准之兩家，自棄</p>
<p>權利，未領貸款）已有兩家，各以領去之六千萬元貸款，于荀日之間，購得三千餘石，正源源運滬，其餘各家，該署正在加緊　促，期各商均能將是項貸款每月週轉三次，否則即撤去其貸款資格，據聞蕪湖一帶糧價較低。每市石僅二萬餘元，　以該地之交通工具缺乏，運輸亟感困難，故一般糧商多僅在滬區附近產地採購，甚盼交通當避對運輸能有所改進，以暢本市糧源。</p>
<p>昨日米市到銷兩淡，惟內地堅挺，產區劃申，搬運不通，是以客性頗堅，粳秈米均回漲五六百至千元，白元亦趨緊，形成盤旋之局，麵粉漲定、油市以平價汕續售，人心君平，回小五六百至千元、黃豆高俏次疲，生仁市化不振，價格下挫一二千元，豆餅亦下降二三百元，路貨小四五百元，聞救濟署洋米零星即將抵申，據米市塲息，昨日本市計到白粳等七種，共七千餘石，其種類及石數如下，白粳三·四三五石，簿稻一·五〇七石，羊秈二〇〇石，早稻一·一八三石，杜　六五〇石，白元二二六石，除元五九石。</p>
<h3>平價菜油　今日出售</h3>
<p>中國植物油廠，近受敵產管理局之委託，出售大量平價菜油，規定售與本市甲級食油零售商二百家，定價每桶（凈三百五十斤）十六萬四千五百元，今日下午二時至五時可到該處付款，並可當塲提貨，逾期則不出售。</p>
<h3>木材市况平疲</h3>
<p>昨木材市况，已趨平疲，杉木昨亦微回下，因賣方多有吐舊，洋松有到貨，價亦不振，柚木因似低，略有吸收。</p>
<h3>地產佳音　减輕契稅稅率　廢出賣所得稅</h3>
<p>政府爲免除地產呆滯，建築業停頓起見，擬將財產出賣所得稅之地產部分，決予廢止，幷調整契稅稅率，將買贈占有改爲百分之六，典契爲百分之四，交換分割爲百分之二，並經於本月十九政院會議決議試辦。</p>
<h3>燒碱市價步漲</h3>
<p>美貨燒碱，實銷日增，價格趨昂，市價續漲，昨日成交頗多，其他價格平平，據業中人云！從美國運滬拷膠白臘紅　鈉硫化碱等，因浦江內碼頭缺乏，均暫停泊吳淞口外，滑石粉及陶土因銷活，價比半月前漲達一倍有餘。</p>
<h3>茶價一蹶不振</h3>
<p>茶市賣風仍甚，一部份需要現款之貨主，雖經連日鬆脫，猶未稍戢，惟實銷有减無已，各貨行情一致慘落。</p>
<h3>敵僞布廿萬疋</h3>
<p>八萬疋已交紡建拋售</p>
<p>敵僞產業處理局，以所接收各堆棧之敵僞花紗布種類繁多，特會同中紡公司另設「接收敵僞花紗布淸理處」專重辦理，由孫伯禮爲主任。據談，該處業經淸理各類布疋逾二十萬疋，其中八萬餘疋業已絡續交紡建公司拋售云</p>
<h3>加拿大紙產　目前無法增加</h3>
<p>〔聯合社衆特利爾廿三日電〕此間印刷業協器主席茜耐爾表示意見謂：目前印刷用紙之缺乏情形，仍將無定期繼續。缺乏程度頗爲「嚴重」，一時尙無急救辦法、而加拿大各造紙廠現正在盡力開工中。在未能獲得新的配備機件以前，生產無法增加云。</p>
<h3>美八大影片公司　聯合組織出口協會　對外從事集體貿易</h3>
<p>〔路透社好萊塢廿四日電〕八大家美國影片公司刻已組成一「影片商出口協會」。據稱：若干國家對於影片頗多專營或限禁之種種限制情形、故該會將代表八大公司，作爲在國外集團經營之代理處。此等國家包括蘇聯·奧大利·保加利亞·捷克·匈牙利·羅馬尼亞·南斯拉夫·荷蘭·荷屬東印度·德國·日本與韓國。議會將在各該外國，代表八大公司，從事集體之貿易，配片及收受業務，契約期限以此後三年爲限，但在德日韓三國，則合同期限較短，十八月後即吿滿期。</p>

<h3>廢除納妾</h3>
<p>— 王重稼</p>
<p>納妾本來是不人道主義，完全是專制時代的遺毒，因爲專制時代一般達官貴人，恣縱任爲，往往廣置妾媵，蓄以作洩慾之器。她們不論是怎樣被寵幸、地位却是低微得很的。庶民百姓，起而效尤，凡無子的，也都借口爲求子而納妾，萬一遇着東獅吼的嫡妻，那妾便要遭殃。</p>
<p>民國以來，專制遺毒，依舊不能消除。而在法律上的規定，妾不能算爲家屬的一員，大凡文明國人，多係一夫一妻制，其多妻者，多爲野蠻不開化之民族。中國以堂堂古國，號稱文明，但蓄妾之風，迄不能除，而一般低劣女性，祗求虛榮，慕富豪之華榮，不惜以清白之身，甘爲人妾，而輕　淫蕩之女性，反視作姨太太爲唯一出路，誠爲婦女界之一大羞辱。</p>
<p>現在，社會到處都在高喊解放婦女，婦女界正可乘此良機猛然省悟，下甘爲人奴隸，慕小虛榮的女性，更可退然思思返了。</p>
<p>婦女</p>
<h3>婦女成功學校</h3>
<p>— 宓惟良</p>
<p>在美國紐約的第五街上，有一所很特別的婦女學校，這裏的學生的年齡，由十八歲到六十歲或更以上；她們的體重，由八十四磅至二百二十二磅，每學期的時間，祗有六星期。</p>
<p>校內的學生，由美國的各州而來，她們爲什麽不遠千里而到這裏來呢？原來她們因爲失去了他們的職業，失去了她們的丈夫，失去了她們人生上快樂的機會，這所學校是叫做杜蓓蕾成功學校（Duberry　Success　School）。起先剛進學校的學生大都是不時髦的婦女，後來將畢業時她們都已成了很漂亮的女子了，本來是平凡的女郞，後來成爲美麗的少女，心境遲鈍的，變成了充滿活力和生氣，進去的時候，似乎毫無靈感，但當你出來的時候，却是一位其有自信心的成功婦女了。</p>
<p>入校後，每一學生，都需經醫生的檢査，然後拍照相，此照片需保持到六星期後，當她再拍照時，她們往往不相信照相中的像，就是她自己。此後，量身長，磅體重，並叙述她體態姿勢上的優點和缺點。</p>
<p>假使她的身體太胖的話，在第一星期中，便體吃些「能消瘦」的食物，開始時，尙需吃幾種藥物，每天吃兩湯匙的礦物油，每天二餐前各服一湯匙，並服鎂乳二磅，每天飲開水二杯。假如感覺頭痛，感冒，或不舒服的時候，可服十喱重膠囊裝的小蘇打，同時每小時需飲白開水一杯。假如你覺得體重不能充分的减輕，那末，也須服同樣重量的小蘇打，當然，無論何時，是不能食白塔油和鹽類，並必需遵行輕瀉法六星期之久。</p>
<p>她們的特殊减輕體重量的食譜，規定如下：早晨的第一件事，須在早餐前一小時實行，就是飲冷開水三杯，接着就是健身運動，早餐包括橘子二隻（連皮吃進）和黑咖啡。十一點鐘時，再吃二隻橘子，下午一時，方進午膳，有牛肉湯，或蔬菜淸湯，蕃茄片，和二隻橘子。三時半，飲蕃匣汁，和二隻橘子。晚上六時，方始吃全日中最豐富的一餐；有芹菜湯，很熟的蔬菜片，洋蕃茹，尾食品。</p>
<p>此後她可聽一聽。己聲音所錄的唱片，六星期後，她將可聽到她的新穎悅目的聲音。</p>
<p>她們的敎室，很通空氣，她們的健身運動，是特別設計的。在她們的敎室中，可聽到女敎師正在用鐵面無私的聲音，喊着健身運動中的步驟和節拍。健康和美麗事實上是不可分離的，據成功學校的當局稱：不但要使這些肥胖的婦女，體重减輕，體態變成細瘦，（或使消瘦的婦女，體重增加）並需敎授她們如何走路，拿物工作，推，提，拉，各種的動作，不但需使每一筋肉適合健康，而且是要美觀而文雅，同時也需保持很好的姿勢。</p>
<p>以後，有另一位的敎師，敎援學生如何塗指甲，美容面部，消除缺陷。</p>
<p>假使學生不能大量减輕體重，（或增加重量），則加以瑞士式的按摩，游泳等。</p>
<p>日後，她到美容室去整容，重新設計她的頭髮的式樣，理髮，重塗她的指甲的顏色，移去她的面孔上的瑕疵，消除汚點。她的面部，手，上腿，下腿，用按摩，脂油，洗皮膚的藥水，來調和其色澤。</p>
<p>學校課程中的跳舞課，是使她們在跳舞的時候，有平衡的姿勢，而几有自信力，以便隨時可出席在社交塲所。學生在畢集的時候，已能够跳康茄，倫勃，狐步舞，華爾斯，賽巴等。</p>
<p>此後由數位敎師，共同相商決定何種的衣服，何種的色彩，使她穿上後，最爲美麗而有吸引力，同時也顧及學生的經濟能力。</p>
<p>六星期後，在畢業的時候，我們可看到這裏的學生，已成爲一羣有生氣的，姿勢好的，美麗的，有吸引力的婦女了。</p>
<p>在道所學校裏，沒有一件事，是掛名假設的，她們都是認眞執事，努力工作，希望能得到一個美好的結果。</p>
<h3>圖一：態度姿勢對婦女是極重要的。學生正在學習如何走路，頭頂有一物，行走時使身體保持平衡。　　圖二：敎師用機械來決定學生的皮　。是屬於何種的型式。</h3>
<p>家庭</p>
<h3>我做後母</h3>
<p>— 老岱</p>
<p>年齡的增加，使我從幼年的時代而達到將近中年。古語云：「男大當娶，女大當嫁。」爲了生活的困難，不能使我再躭延在家內挑選那理想中的丈夫，這是至今還感到痛苦的一件事！將近中年的我，不用諱言的，年青的男子是不會再要我的，那麼當然祗好當塡房了。處於雙方面同意的條件下，我祗得忍辱去做那人家所痛恨的後母了。但是，我很願意，我要使社會上的子女們知道後母並不是個個惡毒，潑辣的，我要打掉人們歷代所遺下的深刻的思想觀念，我要替婦女界放一異彩！</p>
<p>我的丈夫是一個將近四十歲的男子，他是做生意的，人還忠厚樸誠，眞不愧鄕人本色。前妻留下了子女二人，年紀還幼小，據說是最後生的，前幾個都病亡了。家庭生活還稱小康。我進門之後，便開始操家主婦的工作。前妻的子女時常發愁不樂，痛苦萬分，而我的四心也是非常爲他們痛苦的。他們是失了慈母的孤女，並且聽到鄰人們談到後母的如何兇惡，如何虐待種種可怕的故事，在這小小心靈上，怎麽會不寒而慄呢？可是我爲了要完成我的志願，做到不是他們心目中所想像那種可怕的後母。我時常用言語來安慰與鼓勵他們，我非常的愛護他們，使他們認識後母不是人家所說的那麼惡毒，可怕。</p>
<p>日子過的飛快，不覺已一年過去，我的生理也變動了。隆凸起的肚子使我做起事來，感到異常的討厭，麻煩。但是我對於他門的衣食方面，仍然照常料理，我不知他們近來忽然變得沉默少歡，對我含着一種機警，疑惑。我感到異常的痛苦，我不知什麽池方錯待了他們，或許另有原故？我恨不得挖出我的心來給他們看。但是事實不能這樣做，我惟有希望孩子早點出來，或許還有補救的方法。</p>
<p>孩子是呱呱地誕生了，而他們仍然如此，這使我感到非常的愁悶。不久，我才在傭人的口中知道了他們的突變，原來是後母的兒子誕生了，後母當然是痛愛自己兒子的。以前是因爲沒有子女的緣故呀！我們終於逃不了後母的「刻毒，虐待」。唉！這是多麼的傷心呀？他們太可憐了，社會上的後母，種種惡劣的情形，在他們那顆小小的心靈內留下了深刻的印象。</p>
<p>養出的孩子不覺已兩週歲了，時光的飛快，眞使人們感到它的寳貴！我對於他們的衣食，仍留心照料每次出去，總帶點果子玩物給他們，逢到假期，便帶他們出去遊逛。自己生下的兒子，與他們享同樣的待遇，有時候他們還多些。每次他們放學回來，我總預備好點心，來鼓勵他們，敎他們如何上進求學。他們如果有了錯處，我並不打罵，我祗用言語來引導指敎他們。晚上睡時，用古人的忠義有益的故事，講給他們聽。凡此種種，使他們成到家庭的溫暖，後母並不一定是人家所說的那樣可怕，兇毒。</p>
<p>不久以後，他們的臉上不再看見那時常憂悶不樂的形態，而却充滿着快樂天眞的笑容，人兒也變得活潑可愛了。時常逗引着後弟歡笑，親親睦睦地如手如足。每當我看見他們三個子一起在玩的時候，啊！我的心眞興奮快樂了，我終於完成了我的志願！我是一個好後母！</p>

<h3>The Government Yesterday Issued an Order Postponing the National Assembly; Chairman Hosts Tea Party for Various Parties</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 24th Dispatch] The National Assembly representatives have decided to begin registration on the 25th. According to unofficial statistics, more than 500 representatives from various places in Beijing and Shanghai have already gathered. It is heard that the assembly may be postponed to the 20th of this month due to the urgency of the time and the inability to complete some pre-assembly preparations.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing 24th Dispatch] Order of the National Government: The National Assembly originally scheduled to be convened on May 5th of this year is hereby postponed. The postponed date will be determined separately. This order.</p>
<p>[United Press Chongqing 24th Dispatch] Government spokesman Wu Guozhen revealed: Chairman Chiang announced on the 24th that the National Assembly, scheduled to be convened on May 5th, has been indefinitely postponed because the Communist Party and the Democratic League have not yet disclosed their list of representatives. Chairman Chiang convened a tea party for representatives of minority parties and non-party members at 4 pm on the 24th, requesting them to submit their lists of representatives. When they declared that they were not yet ready, the Chairman stated that the central government originally intended to convene the National Assembly on May 5th in accordance with the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) agreement, but it must now be postponed, and the date of future convening will be decided later. At the same time, the PCC Comprehensive Group is scheduled to convene a meeting to seek a political solution acceptable to all parties. The main reason for postponing the National Assembly seems to be the explosive situation in the Northeast, where the Communist Party's position has been strengthened due to its occupation of Changchun and its anticipated occupation when the Soviet Union withdraws from Harbin. Propaganda Minister Wu told reporters yesterday: He believes that the Communist Party hopes to postpone the National Assembly until the Northeast issue is resolved to their satisfaction. He stated: The Communist Party is unwilling to normalize various parts of China in accordance with the PCC resolutions, and this is the reason for their fault-finding.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Chongqing 24th Dispatch] Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, sent another letter to government representatives Zhang Qun, Shao Lizi, and Zhang Lisheng regarding the issue of convening the National Assembly, making some clarifications. The three responded as follows: Respected Mr. Enlai: We have just received your letter of April 24th. We originally intended to clarify the facts you mentioned, but Chairman Chiang convened representatives from all parties for discussions this afternoon. To show the overall situation, the government has adopted the opinions of all parties and postponed the National Assembly to facilitate consultations. As for the issues of expanding the government organization and the draft constitution mentioned in your letter, we have already discussed them repeatedly and there are ways to resolve them. There is no need to engage in further written arguments about who is right and wrong. We only hope that your party will prioritize the interests of the country, consider the suffering of the people, and sincerely and openly cooperate to promote the early realization of all agreements of the Political Consultative Conference, to comfort the longings of the people across the country. We wish you peace.</p>
<h3>Marshall Will Propose a Proposal to Seek a Comprehensive Ceasefire in the Northeast; Xu Yongchang Appointed as Government Representative in the Three-Person Group</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping 24th Dispatch] It is learned that after detailed study of various reports, Marshall will propose a proposal. He may suggest a comprehensive ceasefire in the Northeast. At the same time, US President Truman or the State Department may issue a statement on China policy.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 24th Dispatch] A certain important official who came to Nanjing from Chongqing yesterday vaguely revealed that the government has accepted Marshal Marshall's suggestion and will make every effort to continue to make concessions to the Communist Party, adhering to the "forbearance for the country" and "forbearance for the people" compassionate spirit, and will reopen the door to negotiations within the next three days to seek a solution to the Northeast stalemate.</p>
<p>[United Press Chongqing 24th Dispatch] It was learned today that General Xu Yongchang, Minister of Military Affairs, has succeeded General Chen Cheng, Minister of Military Administration, as the government representative in the military three-person group. Xu has held consultations with General Marshall, and it is widely believed that the three-person group may meet soon. At the same time, Marshall, Chairman Chiang, and Zhou Enlai are discussing the issue at length to seek a solution to the Northeast problem. Although Marshall has not issued any statement, it is widely believed that he has made some progress. The "Xinmin Daily" reported that after listening to Zhou Enlai's report, Marshall has proposed a new peace plan, but there is still a considerable distance between his plan and Zhou's plan. Most people believe that the current situation can be broken soon. The "World Daily" reported that Marshall expressed optimism about mediating the conflict. It is heard that Marshall, during his recent meeting with Zhou Enlai, made definite suggestions for the first time, repeatedly insisting that a solution must be found.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping 24th Dispatch] The dispatch of the 31st team of the Military Mediation Department to Changchun was shelved because the CCP stated that there was no war in Changchun and refused to send people. However, the government representative of the team has been dispatched and will still fly to Shenyang with Deputy Chief of Staff Niu Xianming on the morning of the 25th. Although the US representative has also been dispatched, it has been postponed due to the CCP's refusal. Those traveling together on the morning of the 25th also include Cai Zonglian, the government leader of the Northeast Central Executive Team. In addition, Fei Yuhong, the government director of the Military Mediation Department's news office, and Keith, the US director, have arrived in Beiping in the past two days. The number of US personnel in the executive department has greatly increased recently, all coming from the reduced US military headquarters, totaling more than 500 people. The government is about to launch a large-scale offensive to liberate Changchun and establish the sovereignty of the National Government from Dalian to Harbin. The CCP representatives stated that the "United Democratic Army" will continue to fight and will do its best to oppose the government forces' incursion. It is heard that the CCP army has blown up several railway bridges south of Changchun and has built defensive works around the city. However, all observers believe that the CCP army's weapons are inferior and cannot engage in large-scale positional warfare, only engaging in mobile warfare. At the same time, the CCP army in Changchun has entered the city for eight days, and its administrative power was established two days after the Soviet army withdrew. The current situation is calm, and the street fighting is of a local nature. The CCP army commander in Changchun has guaranteed the safety of some government officials who did not have time to evacuate.</p>
<p>[United Press Chongqing 24th Dispatch] The National Army's New First Army has reached a location 60 kilometers south of Changchun.</p>
<p>More than 3,000 middle school students in Shenyang held a large-scale parade demanding "The National Army to Quickly Take Over the Northeast" and "Oppose the Specialization of the Northeast." They sang patriotic slogans along the way with great enthusiasm. The picture shows students participating in the parade.</p>
<h3>Remembering Changchun (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Written by Fang Ren in Shenyang</p>
<p>The scene in Siping had already been rumored to the ears of people living in Changchun. On March 16th, the person in charge of Mantan Daqi (South Manchuria Railway) announced that all "unnecessary personnel" should leave Changchun. On the 17th, all telephone calls from Changchun to Siping were cut off, and there was no communication to Shenyang south of Siping, or Jinzhou south of Shenyang. Changchun was in a state of isolation in terms of the situation. On the same day, the receiving personnel of the provincial governments of Heilongjiang and Hejiang all returned to Changchun from Harbin by express train. The Mantan Building, which was already housing many people, suddenly added hundreds of people. The rumors from the outside were confusing and tense, and the anxiety of the people was naturally imaginable.</p>
<p>In fact, Changchun's move towards instability, before the 24th, belonged to the air, and there was such an incident. At that time, it was rumored in the city that the Soviet army would withdraw at 9 pm on the 24th, and a certain team would enter the city that night. Every family prepared to buy candles, buy prepared food, and store water, as if they were actively preparing to "cope with the changes." The actual performance was indeed the opposite, but the people's hearts were calmed by it, because the rumor was shattered by the facts, and it finally made people feel: a rumor is just a rumor after all. However, the ardent hope of the common people for the arrival of the National Army did not diminish because of this. Many people prayed devoutly, hoping to arrive as soon as possible. They knew: with the lesson of fourteen years of painful life, a deep brand had been imprinted on their minds and bodies. Only the National Army could symbolize the complete removal of that hateful fourteen-year history from the history of life. They would ask people: Where exactly has the National Army arrived? Has it passed Siping and reached Gongzhuling? However, no one could give them a satisfactory answer.</p>
<p>In the sound of the Soviet army's withdrawal, among the several agencies that Changchun had already taken over, many local young staff members, mostly around the age of 20, were "transmitted" to a certain barracks by "compatriots" wearing police uniforms as intermediaries. At this time, a military officer who spoke our northern Mandarin would persuade these young people to leave their hometowns and go to foreign lands to study military affairs. If not, they were willing to pay a high price, as long as they could give them some news on time. For example, "Where did someone come from?" "Does he have anti-[blank] ideas?" If an answer was obtained to this type of simple question, the person asking the question would be satisfied, and they would also focus on the material life, saying: "Your treatment is too hard, the money we give you is just a token of our appreciation." Of course, in the past fourteen years, most Chinese people were forced by Japan to only say: "I am a person of "Manchukuo"." And in fact, they had really worked as cattle and horses, shed blood and sweat for "Manchukuo," but even people around the age of 20 could understand the taste of master and slave, and the difference between foreign races and compatriots.</p>
<p>The Soviet army in Changchun began to withdraw on March 19th. The large buildings in the western part of the city used by the Soviet army as barracks were emptied on that day, and the buildings that were empty and only had shells were increasing day by day, and huge tanks were climbing towards the station one after another and leaving Changchun. At this time, the receiving personnel gathered in the Mantan Building also left a lot. In such a large building, it was necessary to eat four times a meal in the large dining hall to ensure that everyone could eat, and as a result, it was changed to two times, and finally only once. Fewer and fewer people, the prosperity of the building was obviously a thing of the past, and loneliness, monotony, and anxiety were doing evil in everyone's heart. The opposite of this mood, the people living in the Mantan Building, and the demands of the citizens were consistent, hoping that the National Army would arrive in Changchun as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The situation became more serious day by day. The second security general team, which was airlifted to Changchun from Beiping on January 5th, and the fourth security general team compiled by Chen Jiazhen, plus the local police, were stationed in the vacated large buildings and built fortifications to prevent accidents. On the roads entering the city and in the important places within the city, security teams and the police began to inspect pedestrians. A submachine gun was found on a firewood cart entering the city. On the 27th, it was the first day it rained in Changchun since last winter. That night, in the drizzling rain, three trucks and a small sedan car were seized in the suburbs. The license plate was of the Northeast Headquarters, but the drivers wore the symbols of the Northeast Security Commander-in-Chief's Department. That night, not only gunshots were heard in the suburbs, but also artillery fire, and the lights were also lively, suddenly going out several times at night, which was not common in the past, so all this made the instability of Changchun even more obvious.</p>
<h3>Communist Army in Northern Nine Provinces Moves Southward; Harbin Airport Occupied; National Army Only 60 Kilometers from Changchun</h3>

The full text is as follows: Ladies and Gentlemen, Comrades, I feel that today is the most glorious, happiest, and most memorable day since the government moved to Chongqing eight years ago. Our government moved to Chongqing during the difficult and critical period of the War of Resistance. After a long and arduous struggle, we finally achieved the final victory. This is of course the result of the concerted efforts of the military and civilians across the country. However, the relationship between our Chongqing compatriots and the government, sharing joys and sorrows, sharing weal and woe, and being consistent in life and death, is closer than in other places. Recalling the period when the enemy's forces were rampant, Chongqing suffered cruel bombing by the enemy every day, and the lives and property of the citizens suffered unexpected losses. However, in order to express their loyalty to the War of Resistance and their support for the government, everyone followed one another and died without hesitation. This loyal and unswerving, arduous and outstanding spirit is what I will never forget. As for the amount of money and effort contributed by Chongqing citizens during the War of Resistance, it is the crown of all other places in the country. This great contribution will be written in the history of the War of Resistance and will be a good model for the people to be loyal to the country forever. I grew up in Zhejiang and started my revolution in Guangdong, but since leaving my hometown at the age of thirteen, I have never stayed in one place for as long as eight years as in Chongqing, so Chongqing is actually my second hometown. After returning to the capital, my wife and I will never forget the compatriots in Chongqing, and we will do our best to advocate the construction of Chongqing. I also hope that the personal feelings between my Chongqing compatriots and myself will increase due to the separation and become more profound with time. As for the widows and orphans of the compatriots who died in the War of Resistance, it will be difficult for my wife and I to take care of them after leaving Chongqing. I especially hope that all gentlemen and comrades will promote the spirit of respecting the elderly and caring for the young, and assist our municipal government in properly educating and raising them, so as to comfort the spirits of the martyrs in heaven and reward the society's loyalty and integrity. Finally, I sincerely wish that Chongqing will develop day by day, and that the lives of Chongqing compatriots will become more and more prosperous and become a model city for the country.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Question of Maintaining the Secrecy of Atomic Energy</h3>
<p>Since the Allied forces dropped the first atomic bomb over Hiroshima on August 5, 1945, followed by the second atomic bomb over Nagasaki on August 8, Japan called for surrender within two days, and World War II ended, entering a new era of atomic energy for mankind. Discussions ensued regarding the use of atomic energy and whether its secrets should be kept or managed by international organizations. Although the United Nations has always had an Atomic Energy Commission, attempting to use the United Nations as an organization to take responsibility for controlling the use of atomic energy, a large-scale secret organization was discovered in Canada attempting to obtain the secrets of atomic energy use and export them abroad. From this point, it can be seen how concerned all parties are about the use of atomic energy. Recently, Professor Harold Laski, Chairman of the British Labour Party, traveled from the United States back to England and stated at a meeting, "The new atomic bombs made in the United States are more powerful than those dropped in Japan. One bomb can destroy the two major states of Indiana and Illinois, and five bombs can destroy all of the United States south of the Mason-Dixon Line." Professor Laski strongly criticized the policy of keeping the development of atomic energy secret, calling it an "attack on human security," and said, "I hope that we will mobilize all our strength to end the illegal application of this secret policy; this policy threatens to poison every channel of our international relations."</p>
<p>After Professor Laski's statement, it aroused repercussions in Washington. According to a United Press Washington dispatch on the 21st, atomic bomb experts here expressed displeasure with the statements made by Professor Laski. Professor Laski's opposition to keeping the development of atomic energy secret did not gain much official sympathy. People familiar with the atomic bomb expressed surprise at Laski's description of the atomic bomb's destructive power. As far as is known, the atomic bombs made according to the "Manhattan Project" design have not changed much in style from those used to bomb Nagasaki. Some scientists estimate that the effectiveness of these bombs has increased by about 25% compared to those that bombed Hiroshima. Officials have announced that the power of these bombs is equivalent to 20,000 tons of explosives. At the same time, Senator Hart, a member of the Senate Special Committee on Atomic Energy, also criticized, saying, "I deeply feel that Mr. Laski actually knows nothing about what he said, and even if he does, I cannot agree to disclose it."</p>
<p>If Professor Laski had only issued the above remarks in his capacity as a professor of political science at the London School of Economics, then a scholar's discussion of politics, or being relatively far from reality, would not have been surprising. However, he is the chairman of the British Labour Party, and the British Labour Party is the party currently in power in Britain. Although he himself does not directly participate in Attlee's government, since he is the chairman of the Labour Party, his words and actions should reflect the intentions of the government to some extent and also affect government policies. Therefore, the above remarks have attracted the attention of the world. The above remarks can be divided into two parts: (1) the question of the power of the newly built atomic bomb, and (2) the question of the policy of keeping the development of atomic energy secret. Regarding the first part, Senator Hart of the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Atomic Energy and Captain Chichester, the official observer present when the U.S. military bombed Nagasaki with the atomic bomb, have refuted it, saying that it is completely inaccurate, and we do not need to make any further statements. However, regarding the question of whether the development of atomic energy should be kept secret, we would like to express our views.</p>
<p>From the history of scientific development, the secrets of any kind of novel scientific invention cannot be kept for long. Originally, the so-called new invention in science is by no means accidental, but is based on the accumulation of repeated inventions. For example, without the invention of radio, there would be no invention of radar. The invention of the use of atomic energy is not a matter of one day and one night, but the result of many accumulations of research on atomic energy. Using these results of atomic research, atomic bombs were then manufactured. Scientists can explain the theory of the atomic bomb, and there is no secret to be kept. The technology for manufacturing atomic bombs, under the joint efforts of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, was completed in the United States. Therefore, the secret of atomic energy is not in its theory, but in its manufacturing technology; this is a technical secret. Since it is a technical secret, it is the same as other industrial and commercial secrets and does not seem to be taken too seriously. An industrialist has the freedom to keep his industrial technology secret, and it should not be clamored too much that the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada must announce the secrets of their atomic bomb manufacturing. Churchill believed that the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada have a kind of "sacred trust" endowed by heaven to have the secret of atomic bomb manufacturing. This seems to be a bit too "affected" and inevitably adorns the façade in the same way that Westerners used to go to various colonies and promote themselves as having a sacred mission. However, because the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada have no aggressive ambitions at this time and will not launch aggressive wars to use atomic bombs to destroy human civilization, this is more recognized by everyone. Therefore, although we may not fully agree with Churchill's words and deeds, we can still trust that keeping this secret in the hands of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada is safer for mankind than letting it fall into other places. Therefore, we also find it difficult to understand Professor Laski's statement that keeping the development of atomic energy secret is an "attack on human security." We would rather say that keeping the secret of atomic energy development from falling into the hands of countries that are fond of aggression is a necessary step to safeguard human security.</p>
<p>China, like the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, has no aggressive ambitions. We see the current turbulence in the international situation, and ambitious people are still trying to rule the world with hegemonic tactics. Therefore, we feel that announcing the technical secrets of atomic bomb manufacturing at this time would be enough to threaten human security. If this force capable of destroying human civilization falls into the hands of a country that attempts to dominate the world, what a serious threat it will be to human security. Mankind will no longer have freedom, and most people will be reduced to slavery. This is truly a critical juncture in human history!</p>

Because his wife was arrested yesterday, he was terrified and committed suicide by poisoning. It was determined that he had ingested opium paste before his death, as evidenced by the bluish color of his lips and fingernails. Twenty-eight opium "soft strips" and approximately one qian of opium paste, stored in an iron box, were found on his body, along with 1,480 yuan in legal tender. Inspector Fu has taken custody of these items and handed them over to the town office for safekeeping, instructing the deceased's family to claim them.</p>

<h3>Security Council Heated Debate for Two Hours; Soviet Request Rejected; Gromyko Declares on the Spot He Will No Longer Participate in the Debate; Next Meeting to Discuss Spanish Question</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] San Francisco, 24th (broadcast): The Security Council will reconvene on the 25th to discuss the Franco Spain issue. The Australian representative's suggestion to appoint a subcommittee to review whether Franco poses a threat to world peace is expected to be passed.</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] San Francisco, 24th (broadcast): After a heated debate of two hours, the Security Council yesterday rejected the Soviet representative Gromyko's renewed request to remove the Iranian issue from the agenda. Gromyko immediately declared that he would no longer participate in the debate on this issue. Before the meeting, Gromyko issued a warning, saying that if the Security Council forcibly proceeded with the discussion of the Iranian issue, it might cause extremely regrettable consequences. After the meeting began, Gromyko stated that the previous Security Council resolution to postpone the discussion of the Iranian issue to May 6 should be revoked immediately. The US representative, Stettinius, immediately stood up to oppose, and cited the review opinion of the United Nations Secretary-General Lie (Lie had stated that the Security Council had the right to keep the Iran-Soviet issue on the agenda). Representatives from the UK and Australia expressed their support for Stettinius's opinion, and representatives from the Netherlands, China, Brazil, and Mexico also expressed their opposition to the Soviet representative's views. The French representative suggested that the Soviet-Iranian issue be postponed for nine days for discussion by the United Nations General Assembly, but this was also rejected. At this point, Gromyko stated that the Soviet delegation believed that keeping the Iranian issue on the Security Council's agenda was contrary to the Charter and would no longer participate in the discussion of this issue. The President of the Security Council, Aranha, declared the discussion of another issue (the Spanish issue) in a swift and decisive manner before Gromyko could finish his statement, thus preventing the Soviet representative from leaving the meeting. At that time, all the Soviet representatives looked at Gromyko to determine whether to stay or leave. Seeing that Gromyko remained seated, they also remained in their seats until the Security Council adjourned.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 24th] The United Nations Security Council today rejected the withdrawal of the Iranian issue, causing a new crushing defeat for the Soviet Union. Initially, after two hours of heated debate, the French representative proposed a resolution to remove the Iranian issue from the agenda, believing that it had been resolved, and that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Lie, should make a report on the developments. Gromyko seconded the proposal, advocating for a vote. The result was overturned by a vote of eight to three. At that time, only the Soviet Union, France, and Poland voted in favor of the French proposal. In the eleven votes of the Security Council, seven votes were required for a majority, so a negative vote was not necessary. From this, it can be seen that the representatives of seven countries believed that the Iranian issue must be kept on the agenda until the Soviet Union and Iran submit a report on May 6, explaining whether the Red Army has withdrawn as promised. The Security Council adjourned at 10:05 PM (Shanghai time was 11:05 AM on Wednesday) and will reconvene at 3:00 PM on Thursday (Shanghai time was 4:00 AM on Friday). At that time, it will consider the suggestion to investigate Franco's Spain.</p>
<h3>Interesting Anecdote in the Security Council: Chinese and Soviet Representatives Exchange Proverbs</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 24th] The Chinese representative to the United Nations Security Council, Quo Tai-chi, stated in the Security Council today that when the Soviet Union requested the removal of the Iranian issue from the agenda of the Security Council earlier this month, he and the Soviet representative, Gromyko, exchanged proverbs, saying, "Why fret if the dog is lying on the ground?" Gromyko replied, "The Security Council is shooting a sparrow." He did not understand the meaning, and Gromyko explained that this meant "The Security Council is concerned about a trivial matter that is not worth paying attention to."</p>
<h3>Competition for Power is Complex; Japanese Three Parties Fail to Reach Agreement; Socialist Party Insists on the Position of Prime Minister and Refuses to Concede; Japanese Communist Party Announces the Suspension of the Anti-Emperor System</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 24th] Negotiations on the issue of forming a coalition government in Japan became increasingly complex today, but it cannot yet be said to have reached a dead end. The executive committee of the Socialist Party publicly announced that it would only cooperate if it obtained the position of Prime Minister. Otherwise, it would allow the Progressive Party and the Liberal Party to govern, and the party would rather be in the opposition. There is a rumor in political circles that in the complex situation of the power struggle, if J Hatoyama, the president of the Liberal Party, is expelled from the political arena due to his past extreme nationalism, then former Foreign Minister Yoshida may emerge and succeed him as the president of the Liberal Party.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 24th] Japanese political leaders intend to form a coalition government based on the results of the general election and continued discussions today, but with little success. Emperor Hirohito has ordered his men to submit reports on the discussions between the three major parties, the Liberal, Progressive, and Socialist parties, at any time. Currently, the Socialist Party is firmly demanding important positions in the cabinet, such as Prime Minister. The party's secretary-general, Katayama, reiterated his position tonight, saying that he would not give in. Kawano, a leader of the Liberal Party, said after meeting with Katayama again that he still firmly believed that the Liberal Party could cooperate with the Socialist Party. He also visited Shidehara, who encouraged him to do his best. Shidehara took office as the president of the Progressive Party yesterday, and the party now seems to be watching the situation develop from the sidelines. However, the position of J Hatoyama, the president of the Liberal Party, is still a major problem. His party has the most seats in the new parliament, so Hatoyama is the most likely to succeed as Prime Minister. It is rumored that MacArthur's headquarters has made some statements to the Japanese government regarding Hatoyama's qualifications, but MacArthur's headquarters has denied this.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] It is rumored that Tokuda, the secretary-general of the Japanese Communist Party, has stated that he is willing to temporarily suspend the policy of abolishing the Emperor system in order to participate in the coalition government of the four parties. The Communist Party's past demands to abolish the Emperor system have alienated the party from other parties. Although the Japanese Communist Party's temporary suspension of the anti-Emperor system is important, its number of members is too small to change the Japanese political situation.</p>
<h3>Allied Occupation Forces in Japan Conduct a Grand Parade Today, Another Batch Arrives in Kure Port</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Kure Port, 24th] British occupation forces in Japan, including the British Army, Navy, Air Force, Australian, New Zealand and Indian troops, will parade here tomorrow.

<h3>Britain Asks MacArthur to Return Radium to Its Original Owner</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 24th] The British Liaison Mission to Japan will ask MacArthur's headquarters to return the radium found by the Civil Assets Disposal Committee, which is worth 500,000 US dollars. According to the regular bureau of MacArthur's headquarters, it weighs a total of 83.3 grams, was airlifted here from Guangzhou in August of last year, and is now stored in the cellar of the Bank of Japan.</p>
<h3>After Meeting Gandhi, Hoover Arrives in Bombay</h3>
<p>[United Press, Bombay, 24th] Hoover arrived here today. According to the Exchange Telegraph Company, he met with Gandhi and Nehru in New Delhi. Hoover will also travel to Japan to meet with MacArthur, and will also issue a statement on the food situation in China.</p>

<h3>It is rumored that President Truman has invited Stalin to visit the United States; Truman will soon return to Washington</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 23rd] It is rumored that President Truman may invite Marshal Stalin to visit the United States. The President's Secretary, Ayers, declined to comment, only saying that President Truman will immediately return to Washington after reviewing the naval exercises. The original plan to take a cruise on the yacht Williamsburg in Shakespeare Bay has been cancelled.</p>
<h3>Report on Japanese General Election Released; MacArthur Believes Japanese Democracy Has Made Progress, Clearing Up External Criticism</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 24th] MacArthur received a report on the Japanese general election today and issued a statement saying: "In this election, the Japanese people opposed the extremists and chose the centrists, believing that they are the most capable of serving the people. This trend is very obvious. The Japanese people have also abandoned their inherent philosophical theories, believing that what they have experienced before is nothing but 'controlling the masses and prohibiting human freedom.' From this, it can be seen that democracy in Japan has shown its healthy progress. The Japanese people have been given the opportunity to break free from the shackles of the warlords for decades, and they willingly and sincerely responded to the change in freedom. President Lincoln once said, 'The people are wiser than the rulers,' and the Japanese people are no exception." The report acknowledged the Communist Party's criticism of the omission of many names from the election list and the prohibition of voting, but stated that those deprived of the right to vote were less than four per thousand of the total number of voters. Most of them moved since November of last year and did not report their names to their new residences, but even in this case, they could have voted by mail, but they did not do so. The Ministry of Home Affairs is thoroughly investigating this matter, but in any case, even if these omitted people participated in the vote, it would not change the election results. At the same time, the enthusiasm of women to participate in the election was unexpected, and their results were no less than those of men. Women candidates have no political party organization to support them, and their election is probably due to the fact that they are female and have won the support of women. MacArthur's statement also said, "Pure democracy is an innate spiritual quality that must arise spontaneously from the will of the people and then become a deeply rooted system. It cannot be forcibly instilled. The Japanese people have gained the freedom to express their public opinion and sincerely yearn for it, opposing both the left and right extremes. Based on their experience, these two extremes inevitably lead to the same path, and the result is nothing more than controlling the masses and prohibiting human freedom. What they have adopted is a broad central faction, so that their government can implement a balanced policy and serve the interests of the people to the best of its ability. Democracy has shown its healthy progress from this. It is hoped that the elected members of parliament will live up to the trust of the voters and play a healthy and constructive role in legislation, so that democracy can advance steadily."</p>
<p>Number of Seats by Party</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 24th] MacArthur announced today that more than 27 million people voted in Japan's first democratic election, accounting for 73 percent of the total number of voters. The previous highest record was only 11.25 million people. Thirty-eight female members were elected. The final election results for each party are as follows: Liberal Party 139 seats, Progressive Party 93 seats, Social Democratic Party 92 seats, Independents 83 seats, Small Parties 38 seats, Cooperative Party 14 seats, Communist Party 5 seats, Vacancies 2 (the candidates for these two seats did not receive the minimum number of votes).</p>
<p>Campaign Expenses</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 24th] The United Nations Headquarters submitted a report on the Japanese general election to MacArthur, which was released today. It listed the campaign expenses of each party, with the Communist Party spending the most. The average expense for each elected member of each party is as follows: Social Democratic Party 51,500 yuan, Progressive Party 9,200 yuan, Liberal Party 17,750 yuan, Communist Party 76,580 yuan.</p>

<h3>New Type of Sleeping Sickness Spreading on Okinawa, Threatening US Occupation Forces</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd] Rear Admiral Riefus, a US Navy medical officer, reported to the Academy of Science yesterday that a new type of sleeping sickness is spreading on Okinawa, threatening US occupation forces, and that a vaccine to resist the disease is currently being researched. Naval medical officers reported from the field that the disease is called "Japanese Encephalitis," which was prevalent among the indigenous people last summer, causing inflammation of the brain in patients. According to US health official Dr. Armstrong, the Japanese-style sleeping sickness is more virulent than what has been seen in the United States.</p>

<h3>The Terrifying Future War: Atomic Bombs Launched by Rockets Turn Thousands of Square Miles into Barren Land - Humanity Can Only Hide Underwater or Underground</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Calcutta, 24th] Lieutenant General Thorat, Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Command of India, has had his book "The Evolution of Land Warfare and Its Future," written last year, handed over to publishers for printing. After providing a historical narrative of wars over the past twenty years, the book discusses the current atomic bomb era, stating that people worldwide will enter an era of "underground" living, hiding underwater or in mountain caves to survive atomic bombings. Furthermore, after atomic bombs are controlled remotely and launched by rockets, areas up to two thousand miles away will be ravaged, with effects dozens of times greater than the bombing of Japan. These rocket-propelled atomic bombs could instantly turn thousands of square miles of land into barren deserts, and people can only escape the danger to their lives by living underwater and underground. The next problem becomes how to preserve the food needed for cave-dwelling life during such a war. Countries with vast lands will naturally have greater security in the atomic bomb warfare era, but it will still be difficult to provide comprehensive defenses.</p>
<h3>The Situation of the Philippine Election: Roxas</h3>
<p>Overwhelms Osmeña</p>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 24th] In some districts this morning, Roxas, the presidential candidate of the Philippine Nationalist Party, continues to maintain his overwhelming advantage of two-to-one or three-to-one over incumbent President Osmeña.

<p>[Associated Press, Manila, 23rd] The Philippines held a general election today. According to reports from various islands, although there were large crowds at the polls, the situation was generally peaceful. Presidential candidate Roxas has gone into hiding due to rumors that three people are planning to kidnap him. An Associated Press reporter went to his residence to investigate and saw a troop of Philippine soldiers stationed there, with machine guns densely placed, maintaining strict vigilance.</p>

<h3>A Few Mistakes of the United Nations Organization</h3>
<p>— Our London Special Correspondent, Xu Zhongpei</p>
<p>As I write this, the twenty-first General Assembly of the League of Nations is being held in Geneva. In the assembly hall, the flags of the thirty-four member states are not flying, and the spectator seats are empty. -- All the elaborate arrangements are no longer necessary; these representatives have come to hold a funeral.</p>
<p>In this desolate environment, the chairman, Hébert, gave a speech: What the League of Nations is handing over to the United Nations General Assembly is not only a large fortune, but also "twenty-five years of accumulated valuable experience."</p>
<p>In fact, rather than experience, it is more accurate to say it is a series of bittersweet memories. Within these memories: there are lofty ideals that have disappeared, beautiful hopes that have faded away, the Hoare-Laval Pact that condoned Mussolini (former British Foreign Secretary), the Munich Conference that sacrificed Czechoslovakia, and China's accusation against Japan's actions in the three northeastern provinces.</p>
<p>Thinking back to those years, Geneva was bustling with activity. Wilson, for the sake of an ideal, did not hesitate to advocate and appeal until his death. If he were aware of the end of the League of Nations and the birth of the United Nations, should he be sad or happy? Watching the rise and fall of this great institution for realizing ideals, how could he not feel moved and heartbroken!</p>
<p>Hébert said: "Although the League of Nations is dead, its torch has been passed to a younger and more powerful hand."</p>
<p>Will the United Nations General Assembly be more powerful? Will the United Nations General Assembly be willing to apply the League of Nations' twenty-five years of experience? -- The future of all mankind depends on the answers to these two questions.</p>
<p>The United Nations organization has its own soaring ambitions, but in action, it also lingers in the reality of power politics, just like the League of Nations.</p>
<p>First, in this charter based on equality, the color of power politics is fully expressed. Although each of the five countries, China, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, has only one vote, in the Security Council, the five powers can appoint themselves as permanent members without public election (as stipulated in Article 23 of the Charter). The terms of non-permanent members are limited and can be changed, while permanent members, once appointed, only change personnel, not nationality. Moreover, Article 27, paragraph 3, stipulates: "Decisions of the Security Council on all other matters shall be made by an affirmative vote of seven members including the concurring votes of the permanent members". This means that any resolution will not pass as long as one of the so-called five powers does not agree. Article 108 further stipulates: "Amendments to the present Charter shall come into force for all Members of the United Nations when they have been adopted by a vote of two thirds of the members of the General Assembly and ratified in accordance with their respective constitutional processes by two thirds of the Members of the United Nations, including all the permanent members of the Security Council". This means that if one of the five powers disagrees, the Charter cannot be amended.</p>
<p>Thus, if one of the five powers shakes its head, the United Nations General Assembly, which executes the world peace organization, will be at a loss. The Security Council can use force, but the Military Staff Committee directly under it only allows the chiefs of staff of the five powers to participate.</p>
<p>In this way, the spirit of the five powers dominates the United Nations General Assembly. There is a cartoon in the London Daily Mail depicting the Soviet representative Gromyko going to the United Nations General Assembly wearing a hat of "Power Politics". Bevin stood aside frowning, and Bevin spread his hands and said, "Sorry, sir, please put your hat in the cloakroom". Of course, the Soviet Union wore the wrong hat. But who is to blame? The Charter of the United Nations General Assembly does not prohibit him (or even encourage him) from wearing this hat into the hall.</p>
<p>The second mistake of the United Nations General Assembly is that it assumes that the victorious countries are all peace-loving countries. This assumption is a fatal wound. We can only hope, foolishly hope, that all the victorious countries love peace, but we can never dogmatically make this assumption. Hitler, Mussolini, and the Japanese militarists naturally caused trouble, but since war is inevitable and the outcome is determined on the battlefield, the factors of victory are weapons, industry, and technology, not ideals, not doctrines, and certainly not a sincere love of peace. Common sense tells us that the victorious countries are by no means equal to peace-loving countries, let alone history can help us explain. The hats of "great powers" and "imperialism" have appeared on the heads of "victorious countries." If memories are still fresh, in 1939, the Soviet Union was expelled from the League of Nations for invading Finland.</p>
<p>Similarly, we shout for re-education, shout for eliminating wars, and say that the next generation is innocent, but why should we bitterly stipulate the "enemy country" in the articles of the Charter, which is a treasure trove of peace for millions of years? Article 53 stipulates that "the enemy state means any state which during the Second World War has been an enemy of any signatory to the present Charter". In our ultimate ideal, the world is one family, so why create such a huge feud now?</p>
<p>The third mistake of the United Nations General Assembly is that it is not universal. Enemy countries are of course unable to participate, and even permanently neutral countries like Switzerland and Sweden, which have never had aggressive thoughts, are excluded from the design circle of peace. Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Austria, Portugal, and other European countries also have no part. Since peace is indivisible, why haven't invitations been sent to these countries? The Portuguese representative has already complained, believing that the International Court of Justice cannot be regarded as a perfect court because many countries have not been able to participate in the selection of international judges.</p>
<p>At the first session of the United Nations General Assembly, the French representative also spoke about the scarcity of representatives from European countries. Gathering ideas and benefiting from each other, countries like those permanently neutral countries can be regarded as the most peace-loving countries.</p>
<p>When the League of Nations was handed over to the United Nations, many problems also arose. All expenses of the League of Nations were shared by the member states of the League of Nations. In this way, is the unconditional transfer of all the assets of the League of Nations to the United Nations equal to the illegal robbery of those member states of the League of Nations that are not members of the United Nations? In spirit, does this equal depriving them of their pursuit of the ideal of peace?</p>
<p>The torch has been transferred from the League of Nations to the United Nations General Assembly, but what is worrying is not the external storms, but the fear that the torchbearer will extinguish it nearby. April 10th night in London</p>

<h3>Worldwide Food Shortage: UNRRA's Requests to Our Country Cannot Be Fully Met: Jiang Tingfu Reports to the Press on Attending the UNRRA General Assembly</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Jiang Tingfu, Director of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, who represented our country at the Fourth UNRRA General Assembly, just returned to this city on the 22nd. Yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., he specially hosted the press of this city at the Duchen Hotel, with more than 40 Chinese and foreign reporters present. First, Shen Weitai, Director of the Compilation and Translation Department of the Administration, gave a brief introduction. Then, Jiang Tingfu stood up and said that the Fourth UNRRA General Assembly could be said to be a food conference. According to my estimate last autumn, our country will need one million tons of rice and wheat each this year. After review by UNRRA, the rice and wheat were reduced to 720,000 tons of grain. In the first quarter of this year, UNRRA has shipped 180,000 tons of wheat to our country, but not a single grain of rice has arrived. There are two problems here: one is that there is a general food shortage around the world, and the other is that food distribution is managed by the United Food Distribution Committee, which is jointly formed by the United States, Britain, and Canada. The allocation of food to our country by this committee is very small. For example, the United States exports 300,000 tons of rice, and the amount allocated to our country accounts for only one-tenth of this amount. Siam exports 160,000 tons of rice, and the amount allocated to our country is only 18,000 tons. The reasons for this are: (1) The committee believes that our country is an agricultural country and there is no need to worry about food shortages. (2) It has not yet understood the current special difficulties in our country, such as: (1) Taiwan, a rice-producing area, not only has no food surplus, but also needs to be supplied by the Asian continent. (2) The drought in Hunan last year resulted in only 40% of the harvest, and Hunan has become a famine area. (3) During the war, farmland and livestock in the areas reached by the enemy were mostly damaged, and the situation is serious. Therefore, production in Hebei, Shandong, and other places has generally decreased. After arriving in the United States this time, I discussed the issue of food distribution to our country with various countries. It is expected that 120,000 tons of rice will arrive in our country in the second quarter of this year. The amount of wheat to be shipped has not yet been determined. However, the nature of the food problem is multifaceted. On the one hand, it needs the assistance of UNRRA and various countries, and on the other hand, domestic efforts must be made to increase production. Currently, what can be done is: (1) Major cities (especially Shanghai) should strictly implement a food conservation campaign. Ordinary people do not waste food, but the wealthy class in cities waste even more. Therefore, after arriving in Shanghai, I immediately suggested that the government urgently implement compulsory food conservation measures. (2) The transportation and distribution of food depend on the cooperation of all parties. Priority must be given to food transportation so that food can be quickly transported from various seaports to disaster areas for distribution and relief. Jiang also answered questions raised by reporters: (1) The increase in food production in various places is being actively planned and promoted. UNRRA will successively ship various agricultural equipment and chemical raw materials. (2) The date of UNRRA's work in Asia was originally scheduled to end at the end of March next year, but it may be considered for extension due to actual needs. (3) The date of the UNRRA Far East Committee meeting has been set for June 7th of this year, and the location is in our country. (4) The relief work of the Administration extends to general disaster-stricken refugees within China, regardless of region, nationality, religion, or party affiliation. (5) The funding for UNRRA's relief and rehabilitation work in our country was originally hoped to be US$94.5 million, but after several consultations, it is now expected to be maintained at more than US$560 million. (6) It is estimated that it will take at least until the 37th year of the Republic of China (1948) before there are signs of our country's food production returning to pre-war levels.</p>
<h3>Vice Minister Pang Discusses Relief for the Food Shortage: A Food Conservation Campaign Should Be Promoted</h3>
<p>Pang Songzhou, Vice Minister of Food, met with reporters yesterday afternoon and said that the first priority for relieving the food shortage should be to promote a food conservation campaign, hoping that all provinces and cities in the country will implement it according to local conditions. The pilot project on grain and currency problems is of a trial nature. If the local food situation can achieve good results such as price stability and abundant reserves after the first batch is completed, then a second batch will be held, which is planned to be promoted to the rice-producing areas of Anhui and Jiangxi. As for whether the seventeen grain merchants who received loans this time will have continued hope in the future, it will all depend on their performance. Pang himself has extreme hopes for the future of food prices in the city, hoping that they will soon fall back to the 30,000 yuan mark. In addition, Pang stated that in order to make up for the shortage of food, he has asked Jiang Tingfu, who has just returned from the United States, to suggest to the United Nations that our country be allowed to send personnel to freely purchase in the areas of Burma, Saigon, and Rangoon. If agreed, it will be implemented immediately.</p>

<h3>Colonel Fang Zhizhou Reports on the Situation of Overseas Chinese in the Philippines; At Least Over Ten Thousand Died Unnaturally; Hopes the Government Will Unite to Support Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Colonel Fang Zhizhou, president of the Philippine New China Daily and chief of staff of the Overseas Chinese Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, recently came to Shanghai from Manila. Yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, he specially hosted the city's press at the Xin Ya Restaurant, giving a detailed report on the situation of overseas Chinese and general conditions in the Philippines. Fang first represented various overseas Chinese organizations in the Philippines to pay respect to all sectors of the motherland. He then stated the mission of his visit. According to him:</p>
<p>The New China Daily was founded by the late Premier Sun Yat-sen in 1914 and is one of the two major party newspapers locally. During the Japanese occupation, the newspaper's machinery was completely removed, and many editorial staff were detained. The newspaper's chairman and three editors died as a result. After the liberation, it resumed publication on Double Tenth Day last year. The Philippine Overseas Chinese Volunteer Army was organized under the leadership of the Overseas Chinese Kuomintang branch. During the war, in addition to engaging in underground intelligence liaison work in Manila, it also launched guerrilla warfare against the Japanese bandits in the mountains. It had a radio station to contact Australia and was directly commanded by the U.S. Southwest Pacific Command, cooperating with the Philippine military guerrilla forces. Later, it assisted the</p>
<p>U.S. Sixth Army in clearing the remaining enemy forces. Regarding the affairs of the Overseas Chinese Mutual Aid Society, the Philippine branch, Fang also reported in detail. It is said that there are currently over a thousand members, all of whom are outstanding figures locally. As for the situation of overseas Chinese in recent years, they have suffered deeply from the devastation of violent enemies. It is estimated that among the 150,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines, at least over ten thousand have died unnatural deaths. Over half of the houses in Manila were destroyed. After the liberation, commerce gradually recovered, and the revival of overseas Chinese commerce is quite good, already ten times greater than before the war, which has aroused jealousy among the local Filipinos, so anti-Chinese incidents often occur. It is hoped that the motherland government can unite and become stronger to support overseas Chinese abroad. He then discussed the issue of judging the loyalty and treachery of overseas Chinese in the Philippines, educational issues, and many other matters, hoping that the government would pay attention to them. Currently, the urgent demands of overseas Chinese are</p>
<p>to allocate more ships so that overseas Chinese remaining in the Philippines can return to their home countries separately. It is also said that the Philippines began its election campaign on the 15th of this month, and the matter can be concluded at the end of this month. The election results will greatly affect overseas Chinese. Those participating in the election include the current Prime Minister Osmena and Roxas. The former has overseas Chinese blood and is quite sympathetic to overseas Chinese, while the latter is opposed to them. The election result is still uncertain. However, judging from the current situation, Osmena seems to have greater momentum, and the overseas Chinese are also unanimously supporting him, it is said.</p>

<h3>Answering Readers - Medicine and Health</h3>
<p>Hu Gang Asks I am eighteen years old and have suffered from asthma (chronic bronchitis) since childhood. It often occurs in the spring and autumn. Doctors are helpless. When it occurs, breathing is obstructed and extremely difficult. In the past, the episode lasted only one day, so it would heal in a week. In recent years, it has become malignant, with episodes lasting up to three days and nights, and the exhaustion is extreme. May I ask (1) Is asthma a terminal illness? (2) Please advise on symptomatic and curative treatments. (3) What can be done to reduce pain during an episode?</p>
<p>Medical Doctor Gu Yuqi Answers The root cause of the chronic bronchitis asthma you suffer from must be studied in detail. It is best to use X-ray photography to determine if there is bronchiectasis? On one hand, multiple vitamin pills can be taken internally, and glucose calcium iodide injections can be given to replenish the lungs and blood. You should also consult an internist for a detailed examination and treatment.</p>
<p>Xu Yuanmu Asks Around October 1944, I lived in the countryside. Because I did not get along well with the villagers, I felt quite lonely, so I had a relationship with an unmarried woman who was older than me, about six or seven times. During this time, I felt pain in the glans, difficulty urinating, redness and swelling of the left testicle, and swelling in the lower abdomen. After urination, a liquid similar to semen flowed out. At first, I thought it was because I was holding back sperm. Recently, after reading Dr. Yao Erchang's book on venereal diseases, I realized that it was gonorrhea and that it might even lead to infertility. I am now very regretful. I ask several questions and pray that you will not look at me as a "sinner" and "ignore" me. (1) Are the aforementioned symptoms gonorrhea? (2) Are the symptoms related and can they be cured? (3) Where is a good place to have a full body examination, and how much will it cost? Is there a free place? (4) How long will it take to be cured, and how much will it cost? (5) If I wait until graduation to work (in two years), will the symptoms worsen? (6) Will I become infertile? (7) I am now engaged. Should I cancel the engagement to avoid misfortune for the other party? (Not the aforementioned woman)</p>
<p>Medical Doctor Gu Yuqi Answers (1) It is probably gonorrhea. A scientific microbiological smear test is required for diagnosis. (2) The symptoms are related and there is hope for a complete cure. (3) You can go to the Civilian Clinic Department organized by the Yibang Road Physician Association for a full body examination and consultation on treatment options. (4) It will not cost much, as only the cost of medicine will be charged, or you can go to other municipal hospitals for free treatment. (5) It must be treated immediately. (6) It may still be possible to have children in the future. (7) It is not necessary to cancel the engagement. After curing the hidden disease, you can still marry.</p>
<p>Li Jurong Asks I am twenty-four years old, male. Seven years ago, when I was studying at junior high school, I suffered a heatstroke and fainted. After being rescued and waking up, I continued to study without rest. A few months later, I experienced palpitations, high internal pressure, dizziness, and weak legs. After treatment by a Chinese medicine doctor, I recovered, but it was never completely cured. Last August, I suffered another heatstroke and the old illness relapsed, with even more severe symptoms. Not only can I not study, but I also suffer from mental depression that is difficult to describe. Please advise on a good remedy and recuperation method.</p>
<p>Medical Doctor Gu Yuqi Answers The heart disease you suffer from is probably related to a lack of vitamin B. You should take more vitamins B and C, and at the same time consult a specialist for a detailed examination and diagnosis.</p>
<h3>Service Brief</h3>

<p>A Planned Fraud: To the Editor: I used to work for a government agency. Three years ago, I was dismissed by the puppet government and returned to Suzhou with my family to live off savings, experiencing great hardship. After the victory, the authorities, mindful of my plight, reinstated me. I immediately came to Shanghai to work, but because it is not easy to find a house in Shanghai, I had to leave my family in Suzhou. The expenses in both places are already more than I can afford. Recently, a letter to my family was opened and a large sum of money was fraudulently taken. My family was unaware and fell into their trap. The thieves planned meticulously. I imagine that there are many single travelers in Shanghai who have left their families in the mainland. I fear that similar incidents may occur. Therefore, I hastily write this letter, earnestly requesting you to correct and publish it, so that travelers can take precautions. This humble opinion may be of some benefit to social stability. Wang Wen, respectfully.</p>

<p>Tang Shichang: Mr. Tang Shichang, Deputy Manager of this newspaper, participated in the election for councilor in the Xincheng District of this city. Yesterday, he hosted a tea and refreshments reception for community leaders in the district at the Central Vegetable Cooperative, where he delivered an election speech. After an introduction by District Chief Wang Jian'e, Mr. Tang rose to speak, saying: "I don't like to talk empty words, nor do I like to make unrealistic high-sounding remarks. Therefore, I don't want to express any political views today. However, I can responsibly say that if I am elected as a councilor, I will be a public servant who is both diligent and responsible to all the citizens of Shanghai. I will take the will of the majority of citizens as my will. If citizens have good ideas that they need me to do, I will do my best to do them, and I will never refuse." Subsequently, Mr. Zhu Changli, a representative of the residents of the district, delivered a speech, saying: "Mr. Tang is a devout Buddhist who is kind and compassionate. He will surely seek benefits for the citizens." Later, Mr. Liu Huarui, a Major General Councilor of the Third Army, a representative of the "Jia" leaders of the district, delivered a speech, saying: "I have just returned from the United States. In the United States, I personally witnessed their three election campaigns, which were truly like wildfire, exceptionally enthusiastic. Now that I have returned to my country, I have encountered the first municipal councilor election. That method is much more refined than in the United States. I don't know Mr. Tang, but today, after listening to his speech, I have a deep impression." Finally, Zhou Chunfang and Wang Nanchen delivered speeches, generally stating that Mr. Tang has been engaged in the newspaper business for more than 20 years and also practiced law. On the one hand, he protects human rights, and on the other hand, he acts as a mouthpiece for the citizens. For a talent like him, we, the citizens of Xincheng District, should wholeheartedly support him.</p>

<p>Zhang Yiqu: Mr. Zhang Yiqu, a candidate for municipal councilor in the Second District, was invited by the Second District Office to give a competitive speech at the Grand Theater on Second Avenue at 10:00 AM yesterday, saying: "I am currently the General Manager of the Children's Bookstore. The Children's Bookstore was founded by me in 1930. At that time, the scope was very small, with a capital of only 1,000 yuan. Later, it gradually expanded to 20 million yuan. At the same time, branches were established throughout the country. Now, there are also branches in Taiwan, with the aim of increasingly promoting the education of children, which is related to the fate of the country. This is my only wish. Therefore, since I founded the Children's Bookstore, I have always stood on my post, working hard. After the victory, I also served as the Standing Director of the Bookstore Association and the Education Editor of the Shen Bao, all with the spirit of hard work, serving the public. Now, the municipality is facing many tasks to be done. Therefore, I feel that the ideal municipal councilor should also have the spirit of hard work, being serious, down-to-earth, sincere, and practical, to represent the citizens, to improve the municipality, to increase the welfare of the citizens, and to relieve the suffering of the citizens," etc. The whole venue applauded, expressing extreme sympathy.</p>

<h3>A Word on the Incense Season: "Borrowing Buddha to Enjoy Spring" in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— Communication on the 20th, Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>The incense season has arrived, and people "borrowing Buddha to enjoy spring" in Hangzhou are shoulder to shoulder.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou trains are full, packed like sardines. The railway authorities, to meet the needs, specially added one train and one gasoline train. However, train tickets are always sold out the day before the train departs. This includes all kinds of different people, the poorer ones who want to go to Hangzhou, so they take fourth-class or third-class cars, the richer ones who also want to go to Hangzhou, taking first-class or second-class cars, they have not seen Hangzhou - West Lake for eight years. Today, after the victory, they will naturally "have a good time."</p>
<p>(1) Profits Tripled</p>
<p>In Hangzhou at this time, the happiest are of course the hotels and restaurants. You run through all the hotels in Hangzhou, all hanging the sign of being full. Some tourists ask to share a bed, but the hotel owner replies "There is no place to share a bed." Therefore, hotel room rates have risen shockingly, 10,000, 5,000 a night are very ordinary prices. In the morning, noon, and night, the restaurants also announced that they are full. There are many customers standing waiting for the guests on the table to finish eating, so they can sit down and eat themselves. The voices of the waiters in the restaurants are hoarse, and the abacus of the cashier is constantly ringing. One Hangzhou friend roughly estimated that about 10,000 fish and 5,000 catties of local meat are eaten every day. Originally, Hangzhou's fish, broad beans, tofu, and local southern meat are very famous. Several important streets, such as Yanling Road near the lakeside, such as the bustling commercial streets of Sanyuanfang, Qingtai Road, Xinmin Road, Yingzi Road, etc., each store is competing to win, neon lights are ingenious, radio broadcasts Shaoxing opera, but there are few Shanghai songs. Several dance halls are noisy outside. Hangzhou native products such as sand peaches, incense myrtle, lotus root flour, and tea are sold out every day. Especially Yanling Road, the store is still open until 12:00 PM, broadcasting radio music.</p>
<p>Boats, rickshaws, taxis, and sedan chairs are all making triple profits. It is said that boats can earn 20,000 yuan a day, rickshaw drivers can earn 15,000 yuan a day, taxi rentals are 12,000 yuan per hour. Although public buses are cheaper, the body is a truck, and passengers are desperately squeezing up, becoming "sardines." The sedan chair business is also not bad, each sedan chair can earn 10,000 yuan a day.</p>
<p>(2) Two Types of Tourists</p>
<p>Tourists can be divided into two types, one is from the fields, the peasants, they wear blue cloth jackets, some women also wear red skirts, everyone carries a yellow cloth bag, holds rosary beads in their hands, holding long incense, passing through the road in a hurry, going to the mountains to burn incense. The other is from the city, men in suits and leather shoes, and women dressed in fancy clothes, some women also wear Chinese-style short jackets, but wear long Western-style pants, the peasants who go to the mountains to burn incense will always look at them a few times. These men and women from the city are not used to walking, but when they come to Hangzhou, they always have to climb mountains and ridges, and the leather shoes they wear on their feet are absolutely not suitable for climbing mountains. Smart merchants make a kind of openwork cloth shoes, and straw-woven cool hats, to sell to tourists, almost every man and woman from the city has bought cloth shoes and cool hats. They wear them on their heads and feet, showing an unusually proud look.</p>
<p>(3) Sending off and Welcoming</p>
<p>The monks, they welcome and send off incense visitors, take out yellow books, ask the guests to cultivate merits. People always want auspiciousness, and few people who go to the temple are stingy and do not give money. The Arhat Hall of Lingyin Temple was destroyed by fire, and now it is being rebuilt. In the One-Line Sky of Feilai Peak, a monk uses a long bamboo pole to point to the tourists, and after watching, he reaches out to the tourists and shouts "Amitabha." In the Five-Colored Fish of Yuquan Temple, the people in the temple hold out basins of sliced ​​yam, teasing the fish to compete for food, but the result is also to ask the tourists to give some rewards. Taoguang and Tianzhu also want the tourists to make wishes, so they can fly high in the future.</p>
<p>(4) The Monk "Understood"</p>
<p>The main hall of Jingci Temple is crooked, and many people are worried about this magnificent main hall. The monks hold out the alms book and ask you to write some great wishes. The Wood Transport Well has already been burned down, but now it is still the Wood Transport Well, people, even though they know it is fake, still tell the unknowing people in a serious manner: "This is the one that Jigong used to transport wood from the well to build the main hall of Jingci Temple."</p>
<p>The Liuhe Pagoda is about to repair the temple hall, and the Stone House Cave is also about to repair the hexagonal pavilion. A monk in the Stone House Cave said: "We have no temple property, only a barren mountain behind." Another monk said: "Being a monk to this day, we can no longer eat for free, we should do some labor, and exchange labor for the price of survival, this is the meaning of life." A set of theories, eloquent, the monk really "understood."</p>
<p>(5) West Lake Boat</p>
<p>In West Lake, the number of boats is less seen in the past eight years, but according to the boatmen, it is only half of what it was before the war. Three Pools Mirroring the Moon is a must-go place for every tourist, and the staff of the photo studio there are so busy that they are overwhelmed. The tourists in Huxin Pavilion are also crowded.</p>
<p>In the famous Louwailou and Taiheyuan restaurants in the Inner West Lake, their dishes are also famously expensive, but if tourists do not taste the Louwailou dishes and wine, it is equivalent to coming to Hangzhou for nothing.</p>
<p>On the streets of Hangzhou, seeing incense visitors from various foreign countries with different costumes, it also has a bit of competing for beauty.</p>
<p>In the past, the bulk of Hangzhou's revenue during peacetime was based on the spring and autumn incense seasons. Now, unfortunately, it is impossible to count how many people and how much money are invested in Hangzhou during this incense season.</p>
<p>People are forgetful, the trauma of the past eight years, and the responsibility for the future, when visiting Hangzhou, everything is left behind.</p>

<h3>Under the Threat of Heat, Hong Kong Compatriots Gasp for Breath</h3>
<p>— Air Communication on the 20th, Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Lin Youlan</p>
<p>Opening the newspapers sent from the mainland, recently you can still see words such as ice cubes, cotton-padded jackets, and stoves... But in Hong Kong, we have begun to feel the heat of the summer sun. Summer clothes have already been put on the market, and women are wearing snow-white "sarcenet" long coats, swaggering through the city. On the big windows of department stores, British linen priced at 35 yuan per yard is hung up, and white buckskin shoes drive away their black-skinned and yellow-skinned companions, gaining the appreciation of the owner. Those who are accustomed to (enjoying themselves) are worrying about how to spend the summer. The government, because it is determined to fill in the beach in North Point according to the original plan and build piles, closed the former sea bathing area. If you go to the beaches far away from the city to swim, there are not enough cars to allocate, and there is also a lack of cross-sea ferries. It is said that those beaches still have some uncleared mines. Who would be willing to risk such unpredictable dangers with a golden body? Thinking about it, you still have to have at least an electric refrigerator, but most of the old ones have been destroyed, and the new ones have not yet been transported, which is really a headache.</p>
<p>Changing Seasons</p>
<p>Talk about Easy</p>
<p>However, what is really a headache is the general salaried class. A set of the worst white serge suit costs at least 120 Hong Kong dollars. A suit made of naval cloth costs 180 Hong Kong dollars. British Tootal linen is more valuable than inferior thin velvet, and it is impossible to think about it without 400 yuan. Wear "Hawaiian shirts", the cheapest one costs 40 or 50 yuan. Ties cost at least 5 yuan each, and fresh patterns cost more than 10 yuan. As for Chinese clothing, ordinary willow cloth, new goods produced by local restoration factories have been put on the market, costing 5 to 7 yuan per yard. A new dress, including labor and materials, cannot be done without 30 or 40 yuan. With a monthly income of about 100 yuan, it is really not easy for the salaried class to "change seasons"!</p>
<p>Hong Kong Island Ten Years</p>
<p>Price Comparison</p>
<p>As the seasons change, so do the things in society: electricity prices have increased, water prices have increased, publicly priced items have increased, cross-sea ferries have also increased, and it is said that trams are preparing to increase fares, so public buses will certainly not be willing to lag behind. Although food prices have not yet soared, they have risen to an alarming degree. According to semi-official statistics, food prices in Hong Kong have recently risen 14 and a half times higher than ten years ago. The general income of Hong Kong residents has at most increased four or five times compared to ten years ago. The suffering is self-evident. Ten years ago, that is, the beginning of Japan's invasion of China, at that time, the people of the mainland moved to Hong Kong to take refuge, and food prices began to rise with the supply relationship. The following is a breakdown of each item, to see a shift:</p>
<p>March this year 1937</p>
<p>Category Price (Hong Kong dollars) March price</p>
<p>Rice (per catty) 1.7 0.7</p>
<p>Pork 3.5 0.35</p>
<p>Beef 3.6 0.25</p>
<p>Fish 2.2 0.2</p>
<p>Sugar 2.8 0.7</p>
<p>Firewood 0.1 0.15</p>
<p>Salt 0.25 0.01</p>
<p>Vegetables 0.45 0.03</p>
<p>Salted Fish 3.0 0.115</p>
<p>Tea 4.8 0.4</p>
<p>Eggs (per piece) 0.2 0.015</p>
<p>Publicly Priced Food</p>
<p>Supply Westerners</p>
<p>Recently, the food cost in Hong Kong is at least 40 yuan per month per person, which is the most economical Chinese food, and it is also the figure budgeted by the Labor Bureau for general workers. Foreigners can still buy publicly priced food, fresh and canned, and have everything at home. The government is helping them to raise funds in various ways, and the supply is constant. Therefore, the food cost of a "big boss" at home is not much different from that of his servant or driver, but he eats fish and meat in the morning and evening, coffee and butter, and eats with a full stomach, while his subordinates eat light vegetables and light rice, just to satisfy their hunger. This ingenious calculation is really thanks to the "Far East Relief and Rehabilitation Subcommittee of the British Cabinet in London" for coming up with it.</p>
<p>Mosquitoes Fly Around</p>
<p>Rats Jump Beams</p>
<p>The weather is getting hotter day by day, mosquitoes are flying all over the sky (Hong Kong was known for having no mosquitoes before the war, and there was no need to hang a net in summer). Malaria is prevalent, and there are also many rats. A rat-catching expert was sent from London to carry out a rat-killing campaign, and the authorities have been advising residents to get vaccinations for days. Hong Kong compatriots are gasping for breath under the pressure of the summer heat.</p>

<h3>Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Jiangxi Branch: Promoting Rural Emergency Relief, Dispatching Work Teams to Expand Work Areas and Scope</h3>
<p>— Nanchang Correspondence, 19th, by Li Guohua</p>
<p>Of Jiangxi's eighty-three counties, more than sixty were ravaged by the enemy, leaving only a dozen or so spared. In northern Jiangxi, counties such as Pengze, Hukou, Ruichang, and Xingzi successively fell in the summer of the 27th year [1938]. In the 28th year [1939], the enemy invaded each county along the Nanchang-Jiujiang railway, with Jiujiang, Yongxiu, Wuning, Dean, and Xiushui falling one after another. The provincial capital, Nanchang, was also occupied by the enemy that year. During the 28th and 29th years [1939-1940], fierce battles raged between our forces and the enemy in the border region of Jiangxi and Hunan, such as in Pingxiang, Gao'an, and Shanggao, causing extensive destruction. In the 31st year [1942], along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway, our forces and the enemy repeatedly advanced and retreated, gaining and losing ground in quick succession, leaving villages in ruins wherever the enemy cavalry went. Counties such as Shangrao, Yushan, Guangfeng, Guixi, Hengfeng, and Geyang suffered enormous losses. In the 33rd year [1944], the enemy infiltrated from Lianhua and Yongxin in the west into Taihe, Ji'an, Ganxian, and other counties in the south, engaging in arson, murder, and looting without restraint. In the 34th year [1945], the enemy in southern Jiangxi moved north again, and although the duration was short, the burning and killing were horrific.</p>
<p>Years of War, Enemy Cavalry Rampaging</p>
<p>Years of war, never ceasing, were compounded by the large-scale destruction inflicted by the enemy on the counties in northwestern Jiangxi, where they occupied territory for as long as seven years. The various losses are simply incalculable. In terms of housing, taking Nanchang City as an example, of the original 37,679 numbered houses, 26,958 have been destroyed. Only 10,721 remain, with losses exceeding 70 percent. In other words, the existing houses are less than one-third of what they were before the war. And even that remaining fraction is mostly dilapidated, peeling, and incomplete, having largely lost their original appearance. In other counties such as Jiujiang, Dean, Xingzi, Yongxiu, Ji'an, Ganxian, Shangrao, and Gao'an, housing losses were also above 78 percent. Losses in other dozens of counties were also above 60 percent. It is estimated that the total housing loss in the province is around 390,000 buildings. Approximately 1.6 million people are homeless. In terms of clothing, approximately 2.6 million people lack adequate clothing, and approximately 2.3 million people require partial relief. Due to the destruction of houses, the common people fled long ago. Over the past eight years, a considerable number of elderly people and adults have been killed, died of illness, or even starved to death. Children and infants, lacking food and clothing, naturally have a high mortality rate. Under these circumstances, the abandonment of farmland is inevitable, and it is difficult to obtain an accurate overall figure at this time. Based on what has already been investigated, more than 2 million mu of land in the counties of northern Jiangxi has been abandoned. In many areas of southwestern Jiangxi, there is no sign of human habitation for dozens of miles, and the desolation is simply alarming. Although eastern Jiangxi was occupied by the enemy for a shorter period, and recovered earlier, there is still plenty of land awaiting cultivation due to various reasons. As for the loss of draught cattle in the rural areas of various counties, although the reasons are not entirely the same, there are as many as eleven counties where the loss has reached more than half. The lack of cattle in other counties is no better. Jiangxi province was originally a rice-producing area, so the issue of seeds is not a problem. However, it is very difficult for impoverished farmers to find the money to buy them. All of these issues are being considered by the Jiangxi Branch.</p>
<p>Rural Emergency Relief: Overview of the Pilot Program Last Winter</p>
<p>When it was established at the end of October last year, the rural emergency relief was listed as one of the urgent tasks to be undertaken. Therefore, in early December last year, areas most severely affected and most seriously ravaged were selected for a pilot program. These were divided into: Nanchang area; Dean, Xingzi, Yongxiu area; Gao'an, Shanggao area. The purpose of the relief was to assist in the resumption of cultivation. The target of the relief was impoverished farmers and their families who had already returned to their hometowns (and whom the Branch had actually helped to return). The area of the relief was a desolate rural area. The relief supplies were: cash (to purchase building materials), winter clothing (distributed), salt, rice, flour (distributed or provided as payment for work), seeds, and farm tools (distributed). The relief methods were: distribution of food and payment for work. The ravaged rural areas needed such relief, and the Jiangxi Branch was proceeding with the principles of speed and certainty. Speed meant doing it immediately. Certainty meant that the assistance would truly reach the people, and truly provide them with tangible benefits.</p>
<p>The work teams in the above areas departed one after another in December last year. They began by conducting investigations and convening meetings with local gentry and Baojia heads to decide on all the procedures and methods. They then implemented the program, based on the results of the investigations and meetings, quickly and surely deploying the work. The Nanchang area (excluding the special project handled by Nanchang City) included several key locations in Nanchang County: Shabutan, Wanshe, and Xincun. These places used to be densely populated villages with houses lined up one after another. Now, they are desolate, boundless expanses. Within thirty li, there is not a single house or a single person to be seen. The emergency relief measures in this area were divided into four parts: (1) Constructing three types of farmhouses (bamboo frames and thatched roofs: (i) collective farmhouses; (ii) individual farmhouses; (iii) assisted farmhouses). (2) Distributing cotton clothes, flour, farm tools, and seeds. (3) Providing payment for work. (4) Collecting and burying corpses.</p>
<h3>Original Plan: Building 800 Thatched Cottages</h3>
<p>The Branch's original plan was to build 800 thatched cottages, with 300 allocated to the Nanchang area, 250 to the Gao'an Shanggao area, and 250 to the Dean, Yongxiu, Xingzi area. In addition, 200 brick-tiled farmhouses were to be built, with 80 allocated to the Nanchang area, 60 to the Dean, Yongxiu, Xingzi area, and 60 to the Gao'an Shanggao area. Furthermore, 3,000 cotton clothes and 3,000 sets of farm tools (including plows, hoes, and harrows) were to be temporarily produced, and 500 dan of seeds were to be delivered to each area for distribution. As for draught cattle, the number needed was very large, and the cost was even greater, so a separate request was made for a special appropriation to handle it.</p>
<p>As of now, in the three key locations of Shabutan, Wanshe, and Xincun in the Nanchang area, 127 farmhouses have been built, 1,000 cotton clothes and 900 bags of flour have been distributed, and 2,700 corpses have been collected and buried. In addition, 36 convenient bridges have been repaired. Among the farmhouses, there are collective farmhouses for communal living, assisted farmhouses built with assistance, and individual farmhouses for individual living. Seeds are waiting to be distributed once draught cattle are available.</p>
<p>After detailed and thorough investigation, the disaster situation and disaster areas in the Gao'an and Shanggao area, the following nine key relief locations have been identified: (1) In Gao'an, Xiongjiaqiangxia and Zhangjia in Chongde Township, two key locations, will each have 20 farmhouses built. (2) Fengda and Ouling in Yifeng Township, two key locations, will each have 40 farmhouses built. (3) Angxi and Gongshan in Gaoyou Township, two key locations, will each have 50 farmhouses built. (4) Xiangfushan and Yanjia Mountain in Xiangfu Township, two key locations, will each have 70 farmhouses built. Construction has already begun and is progressing rapidly, and will be completed in the shortest possible time. Winter clothing, farm tools, and seeds are also being distributed according to the actual situation. However, draught cattle are lacking and still need to be purchased and distributed.</p>
<p>The investigation work in the Dean, Yongxiu, and Xingzi area has been completed, except for Xingzi, which is still in progress. The key relief locations in each county have also been determined. The key locations in Dean are Fucheng and Wushi in the first district. The key locations in Yongxiu are Zhanggongdu and Yangjialing. Winter clothing has already been distributed, and thatched cottages are being built according to the planned schedule.</p>
<p>The rural emergency relief in the above three areas has been carried out in sequence and will be completed one after another. Areas that were desolate and uninhabited three months ago now have houses and people. These people are preparing for the work of resuming cultivation. They receive relief in the form of clothing, food, and shelter upon their return, and they are deeply grateful for this. Therefore, when they are assigned to transport materials and build farmhouses, they know that this is for their own benefit, and they work very energetically. They receive salt, rice, or flour for each day of work. For carrying a bamboo pole or 100 bundles of straw, they receive four liang of salt. For collecting one jin of corpses, they receive one liang of salt. If they participate in the construction of collective farmhouses, they receive a total of one jin of salt or three jin of flour per day. This is the Branch's method of paying for work, and the benefits are truly felt by them. Therefore, they work very happily. Sometimes they are so happy that they even sing folk songs while working. They all say in unison: This is the first time they have felt happy in eight years. Speaking of collecting and burying corpses, it makes them sad. Because many of these heads and limbs belong to their fathers, brothers, and children. Having been brutally murdered, the corpses are blurred and can no longer be identified.</p>
<h3>Dividing into Fifteen Districts, Each District Establishing a Work Team</h3>
<p>The Jiangxi Branch's pilot program for rural emergency relief has been effective, and it is deemed necessary to expand and generalize it. Moreover, the entire business development will begin with this great work. Therefore, in late February of this year, the sixty counties in the province affected by the disaster were divided into fifteen districts. Each district will have a work team, with each work team covering three to seven counties.</p>
<p>The selection of the team leaders for these fifteen work teams (except for the Nanchang area) has been decided after much searching and consideration. Because this kind of work is extremely difficult, it requires a spirit of service and intelligent qualities to be able to do it happily. Now that the selection of personnel has been finalized and the preparations are complete, they have set off one after another, advancing separately. As for the work guidelines, its organization and business items, rural emergency relief is the main item—there are other detailed and specific regulations, which are not within the scope of this article and will be reported in another article.

<p>Editor: The city will elect its first municipal councilors on April 28th. This is an important step in practicing democracy and the best test of public opinion. However, according to the newspaper's special report on the 20th, only a little over a thousand Class A candidates for public office have emerged among the 3.3 million citizens of the city. Why, at a time when democracy and autonomy are being loudly proclaimed, do citizens still lack interest in campaigning? I think that in addition to the two possible explanations of "not enough time" and "not enough publicity," the facts are not being presented genuinely enough. Now that the election date is approaching, candidates participating in the election should, in principle, be working hard in their respective electoral districts to promote their true talents and learning, and their political ideas, in order to win the trust and support of the dominant voters. However, as of this writing, very few are actually doing so. Those who are adopting the methods of "relying on personal connections" and "wooing with banquets" are very enthusiastic. If a portion of this municipal council is truly won by the latter methods, then it is still far from "democracy." Moreover, the amount of money wasted on these banquets is appalling, with no regard for the hardship of the masses or the cries of the disaster areas. I think that candidates with true insight and vision would never do this. My feelings are directed towards the meaning of criticizing the worthy in the style of the Spring and Autumn Annals. Please emulate the spirit of free elections in allied nations, and appeal to voters based on political views and knowledge, and save the money spent on banquets to support the Teacher Respect Movement or disaster relief work. Wouldn't that be better? Que Yifan, 21st.</p>
<p>The Issue of Private Schools Increasing Tuition Fees</p>
<p>Editor: I greatly admire the noble intentions of the Teacher Respect Movement reported in your newspaper, but it seems that poor students have not been considered or cared for. I would like to submit a few opinions and kindly request that they be published: (1) Public and private schools both cultivate youth. Since public school students can be exempted from tuition increases, why should private schools be the only ones to increase tuition by double? (2) Private school students' families have varying degrees of wealth. Poor families struggle to raise tuition fees for their children, and before they can catch their breath, they are suddenly asked to pay double. They simply do not have the strength to do so. (3) It is said that private schools claim that increasing tuition by double is not fundraising, but in reality, it amounts to coerced donations, which poor students cannot bear. (4) Which parents do not wish their children to succeed in their studies? If I am unable to continue paying due to lack of funds, should I then stop attending school? (5) If I stop attending school because of this, is there a risk that many idle children will go astray? Do schools have any remedial measures? (6) The enthusiasm and dedication of the private schools and the teachers' efforts to educate and cultivate talent are deeply admired. However, I can think of other good methods, such as voluntary fundraising. Wealthy people have surplus money and can donate more without any problem, while poor people cannot even afford food and firewood, so let them be. (7) Or, ask the government to understand this plight and provide appropriate subsidies, so that they know that schools and teachers are not simply a labor-capital relationship, and poor teachers are like coolies. The government must also show some compassion in order to popularize education and prevent the poor from being excluded. Ye Gong, submitted.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Women's Normal School Students: Suddenly Requesting Leave Pending Orders, Suddenly Resuming Classes Pending Orders</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou] During the war, students at the Guangdong Provincial Women's Normal School could receive 2.3 dou of public grain per month. After the victory, the public grain was converted into a cash payment of 4,000 yuan, but they only actually received 1,500 yuan per month. This is only enough to eat for three or four days a month, and they are hungry for most of the time. Recently, the students of the Women's Normal School held a meeting to discuss and decided to submit five demands to the Education Department: (1) Provide full meals or issue a loan of 15,000 yuan. (2) Thoroughly improve the school's sanitary facilities. (3) Improve the curriculum for normal school students. (4) Please approve the extension of service for normal school students. (5) Guarantee employment for normal school graduates and improve teachers' salaries. Director Yao of the Education Department came to the school to give a speech, and student representatives presented the above five demands. Director Yao promised to forward them to the Ministry of Education for review. All students of the Women's Normal School requested "leave pending orders." However, after continuous efforts for several days, they were unable to obtain satisfactory results. However, considering that their studies could not be abandoned for long, they resumed classes on the 18th, continuing their requests and resolving to "resume classes pending orders" in order to strive for satisfactory results.

<h3>Teachers and Students Have Their Own Land: School Land Allocated as School Property to Encourage Teachers and Students to Cultivate It</h3>
<p>[Special Report from our Chongqing Office] The Ministry of Education recently announced 14 articles of implementation measures for allocating school land in various provinces, cities, and counties as school property. The original text is as follows: (1) The school land of each province, city (including cities directly under the Executive Yuan), and county should be allocated to local schools as school property in accordance with the provisions of these measures, and teachers and students of each school should be encouraged to cultivate it themselves. (2) Provincial school land in each province, such as the academies of prefectures and counties during the imperial examination era, school properties, and academy properties of prefectures, circuits, and provinces, should be allocated to provincial secondary schools nearby as school property. (3) Public school land of counties and cities should be allocated to public primary schools and central schools and secondary schools in the city or county as school property. (4) The allocation of school land should be based on the number of classes. In principle, each class in secondary schools should be allocated 5 to 10 mu, and each class in central schools should be allocated 2 to 5 mu. The allocation should be determined based on the amount of school land available locally. (5) The land allocated to schools for cultivation should be within 5 li from rural schools and within 10 li from urban schools. If there is a surplus after allocation, it should be allocated to nearby schools. (6) The allocation of provincial and municipal school land will be handled by the provincial and municipal education departments, and the allocation of county and city school land will be handled by the county and city governments. Both will be reported by the provincial and municipal education departments to the Ministry of Education for review and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for record. (7) The school land allocated as school property will be cultivated by the teachers and students of each school. However, if students' physical strength and skills are insufficient for the work, temporary laborers may be hired to assist. The land may also be leased to people for cultivation. Forestation should also be actively carried out on mountain land. (8) School land in each school should be mainly used for planting rice, wheat, miscellaneous grains, and nutritious vegetables. (9) The cultivation of school land in primary schools and central schools should be linked to the learning of general knowledge and natural science materials. In secondary schools, it should be linked to subjects such as biology, natural history, hygiene, manual labor, agricultural and industrial arts, and practical training, as well as productive labor training. (10) After the allocation of school land to provinces, cities, and counties to schools, the schools should organize a committee to manage it. All receipts and expenditures should be formally included in the school budget. Before the educational funds of the provinces and cities are raised to compensate, one-third of the original rent should still be paid, and the rent should be reduced annually until the end of the 35th year of the Republic of China, when the compensation is raised and the rent is completely waived. (11) After the school land of provinces, cities, and counties is allocated as school property, the amount of revenue and expenditure should be investigated and listed in the national and autonomous budgets by the provincial education departments and the municipal and county education bureaus before the beginning of each fiscal year. (12) When the acreage of school land allocated to central schools exceeds the prescribed standard, its cultivation should be carried out jointly with nearby national schools. (13) The income from the self-cultivated school land of schools, in addition to paying taxes and meeting the needs of food and nutrition, should be used to enrich equipment fees. The income from other school land, in addition to paying rent, should be used to expand school facilities or supplement current expenses. (14) This law will be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>

<h3>Post-War Normal School Students Extend Service Period</h3>
<p>[Special Report from our Nanjing Office] Normal school students are required to serve in primary schools after graduation because they have received public funding. Before the war, it was stipulated that they could continue their studies or transfer to other fields of service only after completing two years. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, in order to promote national education and cultivate teachers for the country, the Ministry of Education agreed that teachers should be used for the benefit of the country. On the one hand, it formulated active measures to enable normal school students to have opportunities for further studies and improve teachers' treatment. On the other hand, it specially stipulated an extension of the service period for normal school graduates by one year. In the past, the service period for normal school graduates from senior high school was two years, but it has now been changed to three years. As for simplified normal schools (divided into four-year and three-year national programs, all of which are for those who have graduated from higher primary schools and received four or three years of normal school education), graduates who have served for one year with excellent results may, after assessment and approval, be promoted to senior high school normal departments for further studies. The one-year simplified normal school (for those who have graduated from junior high school and received one year of normal school education) does not apply to the aforementioned preferential promotion method.

<h3>Educational Trends in Taiwan Province</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent in Taiwan, Muyun</p>
<p>Under the planning of the Education Department of the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office, education in Taiwan Province is currently being promoted in an orderly manner. The report is as follows:</p>
<p>The Taiwan University Incident Resolved: The incident at the Affiliated Hospital of National Taiwan University, the highest institution of learning, lasted from the 22nd of last month to the 11th of this month before it was resolved. The cause was that some assistant obstetricians requested the school authorities to issue letters of appointment, and some of those who were unpaid requested to be changed to paid. As a result, both sides insisted, resulting in a deadlock. Notices saying "Sorry to the Patients" were posted high at the gate, and slogans such as "Down with the Patronage System" and "We are Willing to be the 72 Martyrs of the Scientific Revolution" were everywhere on the road, opening a new atmosphere of strikes and medical stoppages in higher education in Taiwan Province. After President Luo returned to Taiwan, he summoned representatives of the two hospitals and agreed to the demands they had made. He supported democratization, and thus the uproar subsided.</p>
<p>Difficulty in Popularizing Mandarin: The movement to replace Japanese with Mandarin has been affected by the inability to quickly develop politics, which has affected its popularity. The 96 Mandarin teachers recruited by the Education Department in Shanghai have been assigned to provincial middle and primary schools after a week of training, but due to insufficient personnel, the distribution is uneven. In fact, the army has helped promote the popularization of Mandarin. The Political Department of the 70th Army in Taipei has trained two classes of students, and it is already difficult for general primary schools to use simple Mandarin to teach because the teachers are all from the province. There are 19 youth training centers in the seven districts of Taipei County, one of which in Shilin Town has been designated as the site for promoting Mandarin, in accordance with the Education Department's regulation of one per county, but it has not yet opened. Since the beginning of December last winter, the national army in Taichung expanded the city's Mandarin training classes from 18 to 24, and the number of students increased from 2,000 to 3,000. Now, it has sharply decreased to only 7 or 8 people per class in the urban area, which originally had 20 to 30 people, a decrease of more than two-thirds. The Tainan China Daily seriously pointed out that this is a terrible low ebb.</p>
<p>Difficulties with National Schools: As national schools implementing compulsory education, most of the school buildings are occupied by troops. The Garrison Headquarters has notified the troops to move out before the 15th, which is expected to solve a difficult problem. Taking Taipei County as an example, there were originally 135 national schools, and the most common number of classes was 28 to 30 classes, such as the Jiaoxi and Ruifang Jiufen National Schools in Yilan. Currently, the students that each school can accommodate are only 30% to 70%, which is a common phenomenon. The principals and important teachers were all Japanese in the past. After they left, Taiwanese took over. The number of teachers has been greatly reduced, and because funds cannot be issued on time, most of them are withheld by the school groups and support associations that support the families. As a result, teachers from other provinces are planning to return home every day, and the Taiwanese are also complaining.</p>
<p>The Prevalence of Petitions: It is very common in the education sector to "appeal" to the authorities and submit "petitions." Some are "blood-printed" with fingerprints. For example, the Provincial Conference of Helpless Scholars in the Datun District of Taichung City "petitioned" the county authorities to request recognition of their qualifications, and then sent representatives to the Administrative Office to submit a "petition." The Civil Engineering and Survey School, a private school in Taiwan, has requested to be changed to a public school because the funds have not been settled, and 72 students and faculty members have jointly submitted a "blood-printed" document. This situation is prevalent in various counties and cities.</p>
<p>Stagnation of Mountain Education: The education of the Shushen indigenous people (i.e., the Takasago people) in the mountain areas, who are located in 22 communities in Taipei County, with about 7,600 people, was carried out in 15 educational institutions established by the Japanese in the past, implementing assimilation policies. The teachers were all armed, and the police were purely oppressive in their education. Since the Japanese left, all of these schools have been shut down. Because the land is barren, the people are poor, and due to environmental reasons, no one is willing to go. Taipei County once recruited educators who were interested in working with the mountain people, but only a few who applied were not educators. Now, the Education Department has set a deadline of the end of this month to complete the supervision and improvement of the national schools for the mountain people, and it is expected that there will be concrete and active measures.</p>
<p>The Style of Respecting Teachers Has Not Declined: In Taiwan, due to past Japanese education, the style of respecting teachers has not declined to this day. The reporter visited the Hsinchu Provincial Commercial Vocational School. According to Principal Wang, the students' good customs of respecting teachers are not found in the mainland. Not only do they salute when they see teachers, but lower grades also stand at attention when they see higher-grade classmates. Petty thieves even steal things from the military but do not take items from the school. Teachers are looked down upon by parents for watching movies and going to bars (since most bars are places for nonsense), and the environment restricts their lives, but the position of teachers is superior, equivalent to the local authoritative gentry. He said happily: I am already the fifth principal after the takeover. The students can already understand Mandarin. Every morning and evening, they raise the flag, sing the party song, and give speeches. Japanese aggressive songs and wearing wooden clogs are prohibited. The students all want to be officials. Of the more than 30 students who just graduated, 19 have been introduced to the city government.</p>
<p>Shrines Changed to People's Education Centers: The Education Department ordered the Japanese shrines in the province to be changed to people's education centers or memorial halls. There are 11 shrines in Taipei County, and they are now planning to reorganize them. The director of the People's Education Center has been appointed, but there is no equipment, and the education funds in the next year's budget must pay more than 40 million, while the estimated tax revenue is only 4 or 5 million. The economic difficulties have put social education and school education in a dilemma. The Japanese who are about to be dismissed and those who are requisitioned and retained know that the fate of the decadent and lost shrines is over, but they do not change their past style and still bow deeply from afar when passing by.</p>

<h3>Amidst Heavy Surveillance, Government Bonds Grow Increasingly Popular, Chinese Stocks Traded for Only One Hour</h3>
<p>Government bonds displayed a rare phenomenon yesterday, with police intensifying their crackdown. Suspicious trading houses were subjected to rigorous interrogation. The head of a certain unit on the seventh floor of the stock exchange building was investigated in detail and taken to the police station for questioning. However, transactions, pieced together from various sources, were intermittent. Some were conducted indoors. Initially, at the morning opening, prices lingered around 6,000 yuan. Subsequently, with the involvement of major players from the eastern and western districts, trading became increasingly active, briefly hitting a new high of 6,400 yuan before fluctuating around 6,300 yuan. As a result, Category C bonds closed with a slight increase of 100 yuan compared to the previous day's closing. Unclassified A and B bonds rose by another 300 yuan due to large-scale arbitrage. Category E bonds increased by 200 yuan, while Category D bonds, which were priced the lowest the previous day, rose by a remarkable 400 yuan. Chinese stocks were traded for only one hour before trading was halted. This followed the arrest of a major player from the yarn and cloth building by plainclothes detectives, who took the responsible person to the police station for further investigation. Similar inspections of accounts were carried out elsewhere, leading to a widespread cessation of trading as people sought to avoid attention. However, after the account investigations, sporadic bidding slightly increased prices. After opening, Yong Yarn reached a high of 5,150 yuan, Meiya 4,200 yuan, and Jingfu 423 yuan. Demand for underwear continued, resulting in the highest price increases. Ultimately, Yong Yarn and other seasoned stocks closed slightly lower than the previous day, while other stocks showed mixed gains and losses, except for Chinese underwear, which continued to rise by 10 yuan. Due to the complete shutdown after 10:00 AM, trading times varied, making it difficult to determine a unified price. Foreign stocks also showed some apprehension under unfavorable circumstances, with most stocks slightly declining.</p>
<h3>Crackdown on the Black Market for Securities, U.S. Dollars Become a Rare Commodity Again</h3>
<p>Fueled by reports that U.S. agencies in China would be settling salaries in national currency at the U.S. dollar exchange rate starting in May, sensitive individuals feared a significant reduction in the supply of U.S. dollars, leading to speculative hoarding and driving up buying. Although the opening price was stable, it quickly jumped by 100 yuan. After the stock market suspended trading at 10:00 AM, after some fluctuation, another round of price increases began, reaching a high of around 2,350 yuan. A minor sell-off then occurred, briefly pushing the price down to within 2,300 yuan before noon. In the afternoon, the market remained tight, with buyers struggling to find sellers, and bidding gradually increased again. As a result, the closing price was 170 yuan higher than the previous day. The gold exchange rate reached 680 yuan per ten taels. The official U.S. dollar exchange rate remained stable, with bank selling prices still around 2,060 yuan. Hong Kong electricity (shares) and rubber (shares) remained stable, while Hong Kong dollar notes (both new and old) rose by 10 yuan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that in order to strictly control U.S. dollars, the authorities will take significant measures and cooperate with the U.S. military authorities in Shanghai to exchange all salaries into legal tender before distribution to prevent them from flowing into the black market. At the same time, the authorities will also establish strict crackdown measures on the buying and selling of U.S. dollars in the black market.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Rebound</h3>
<p>Smelted gold prices were stable yesterday, and the sudden surge in U.S. dollars boosted buying sentiment in the gold market, briefly approaching the Central Bank's allocated price. The morning opening was flat, but the sudden stimulus from the U.S. dollar triggered buying, gradually pushing prices up. At the time of the Central Bank's allocation, it was around 1,575,000. After the stock market shut down at 10:00 AM, speculative funds shifted to gold, which followed the rise of the U.S. dollar, reaching 1,595,000. Subsequently, buyers became apprehensive, and prices fell by over 20,000, hovering around 1,580,000 at noon. In the afternoon, the U.S. dollar strengthened again, and the gold market, aided by this, rebounded slightly, resulting in a rise of 30,000. Ornament gold was 168,000, silver bullion 1,600, and silver dollars were sold at 1,050 yuan. Informal interest rates remained loose, with interest rates ranging from one to one and a half cents.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Price Increases Gradually Intensifying, 20-Count Yarn Most Popular</h3>
<p>The yarn market experienced more significant price increases yesterday. Twenty-count Shuangma (Double Horse) yarn suddenly jumped by 70,000 yuan due to speculative interest. The remaining 22-count yarn, both large and small, also increased by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, boosting market confidence. Currently, the yarn market favors 20-count yarn, as demand for 20-count is the highest among various groups. As a result, the supply of 20-count yarn, regardless of large or small factories, cannot meet demand. Furthermore, Fangjian (Spinning &amp; Construction) Company supplies very little 20-count yarn, making it difficult for prices to fall in the short term. Yesterday was also the regular sales date for Fangjian Company, with prices similar to the previous time. However, nine additional sets of yarn were auctioned, with industry participants bidding competitively.</p>
<h3>Rayon Prices Rise by 100,000, Spun Silk Stable, Silk Fabrics Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for rayon saw more buying than selling, and prices rose sharply. The opening price for 120-count Tianqiao (Sky Bridge) was high at 1,490,000 yuan, and then rose to 1,540,000 yuan at closing. In the afternoon, there was a slight pullback to 1,520,000 yuan, resulting in a rise of as much as 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Semi-gloss rayon rose by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan, while spun silk prices remained stable. There were no transactions in foreign goods. Ordinary five-dan goods were traded at 1,850,000 yuan for ten-day promissory notes and 1,870,000 yuan for fifteen-day promissory notes. Silk fabric transactions were very active yesterday, and price increases were also severe. Meiya (American-Asian) bedding rose by 100,000 yuan per hundred pieces. Dachang (Great Success) checkered fabric opened at 3,560 yuan per piece and later traded as high as 3,720 yuan.</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Trading Slightly Weaker, Market Prices Rise by 1,000-2,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the New York cotton market was closed due to a holiday, and there were no telegrams. The spot cotton market in M埠 (Mu Port) remained robust, but trading was slightly weaker. High U.S. dollar and yarn prices made it difficult for factories to reach an agreement, resulting in no transactions. Only 600-700 bales were traded among industry participants. Market prices rose by another 1,000-2,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Trading Scarce</h3>
<p>Summer woolen fabrics were in short supply in the market, and prices remained high. Although Western clothing tailors and customers from various ports had demand, few actual transactions occurred due to high prices. Sales of spring fabrics were also low, as most sales to Japan had already taken place. Sales of black autumn and winter fabrics were even lower. The woolen fabric market was in a stalemate, with no major fluctuations.</p>
<h3>Coal Ball Retail Sales Slow, Firewood and Charcoal Also Stagnant</h3>
<p>Since the resumption of production by various coal ball factories, production has increased rapidly. However, retail sales of coal balls have slowed down due to the prevalence of liquid fuels and the continued sale of cheap white coal dust. Although factories maintain their original prices, they secretly offer commissions to compete. Due to cost considerations, the supply of firewood and charcoal is limited, but sales are also affected by the aforementioned factors and are stagnant, with market prices fluctuating at a low level.</p>
<h3>Flour Trading Prohibited, Rice Prices Remain Firm, Inconvenient Inland Transportation Also a Reason for Price Increases</h3>
<p>Since flour prices soared following rice prices last week, they have been rising sharply in recent days. In order to prevent speculation and stabilize people's livelihoods, the municipal authorities prohibited trading in flour yesterday. The municipal miscellaneous grains and oil cake market also excluded flour from its trading scope. Yesterday, a notice was issued to stop flour trading in the market.</p>
<p>The rice and grain purchased and transported by grain loan merchants have recently arrived in excess of 1,000 shi, with more arriving continuously. According to the person in charge of the department, among the fifteen companies that received loans to purchase grain (the other two companies that had been approved forfeited their rights and did not receive loans), two companies had each purchased more than 3,000 shi with the 60 million yuan loan they received and were transporting them to Shanghai. The department is urging the remaining companies to turn over the loans three times a month; otherwise, their loan qualifications will be revoked. It is reported that grain prices in the Wuhu area are lower, only over 20,000 yuan per shi, but due to the lack of transportation tools in the area, transportation is extremely difficult. Therefore, most grain merchants only purchase from production areas near Shanghai. It is hoped that transportation authorities can improve transportation to smooth Shanghai's grain supply.</p>
<p>Yesterday, both arrivals and sales in the rice market were slow, but inland prices were firm. Production areas were divided, and transportation was blocked, so buyers were firm. Japonica and indica rice rebounded by 500-1,000 yuan, and white glutinous rice also tightened, forming a fluctuating situation. Flour prices stabilized, and the oil market continued to sell cooking oil at stable prices, and public sentiment was generally calm. Cooking oil rebounded by a small amount of 500-1,000 yuan. Yellow soybeans were expensive and secondary quality soybeans were weak. The groundnut market was depressed, and prices fell by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Soybean cake also fell by 200-300 yuan, and road goods fell by 400-500 yuan. It is reported that relief agency foreign rice will soon arrive in Shanghai. According to the rice market, yesterday, the city received over 7,000 shi of seven types of rice, including white japonica. The types and quantities are as follows: white japonica 3,435 shi, thin rice 1,507 shi, sheep indica 200 shi, early rice 1,183 shi, Du rice 650 shi, white glutinous rice 226 shi, and glutinous rice 59 shi.</p>
<h3>Affordable Vegetable Oil for Sale Today</h3>
<p>The China Vegetable Oil Factory, entrusted by the Enemy Property Administration, is selling a large amount of affordable vegetable oil, stipulating that it be sold to 200 Class A edible oil retailers in the city. The price is set at 164,500 yuan per barrel (net 350 catties). Payment can be made at the factory from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM today, and goods can be picked up on site. Sales will not be made after the deadline.</p>
<h3>Lumber Market Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the lumber market was flat and weak. Fir also fell slightly yesterday because many sellers were releasing old stock. There were new arrivals of foreign pine, and prices were also weak. Teak, because prices were seemingly low, saw some absorption.</p>
<h3>Good News for Real Estate: Reduced Deed Tax Rate, Abolished Income Tax on Sales</h3>
<p>In order to avoid stagnation in real estate and a standstill in the construction industry, the government plans to abolish the real estate portion of the income tax on the sale of property and adjust the deed tax rate, changing the purchase, gift, and possession rate to 6%, the mortgage rate to 4%, and the exchange and division rate to 2%. The decision to pilot this was made at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 19th of this month.</p>
<h3>Caustic Soda Market Prices Rising</h3>
<p>Sales of American caustic soda are increasing daily, and prices are trending upward. Market prices continued to rise, and many transactions took place yesterday. Other prices were stable. According to industry insiders, the American rubber, white wax, red sodium, and sodium sulfide shipped from the United States to Shanghai have been temporarily anchored outside Wusongkou due to the lack of piers in the Huangpu River. Talc and pottery clay prices have more than doubled compared to half a month ago due to brisk sales.</p>
<h3>Tea Prices in Free Fall</h3>
<p>Selling pressure in the tea market remains high. Some cargo owners who need cash have continued to sell off their stock for days, but without relief. Actual sales are declining, and prices are falling across the board.</p>
<h3>200,000 Bolts of Enemy and Puppet Cloth</h3>
<p>80,000 Bolts Have Been Handed Over to Fangjian for Sale</p>
<p>The Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, due to the wide variety of enemy and puppet cotton yarn and cloth received at various warehouses, has jointly established a "Receiving and Clearing Office for Enemy and Puppet Cotton Yarn and Cloth" with China Textile Company to handle the matter. Sun Boli is the director. It is reported that the office has cleared over 200,000 bolts of various types of cloth, of which over 80,000 bolts have been successively handed over to Fangjian Company for sale.</p>
<h3>Canadian Paper Production Cannot Be Increased Currently</h3>
<p>[United Press Montreal, 23rd] Qian Nai'er, chairman of the Printing Industry Association here, expressed the opinion that the current shortage of printing paper will continue indefinitely. The degree of shortage is quite "severe," and there is no immediate solution. Canadian paper mills are currently working hard to operate. Production cannot be increased until new equipment is obtained.</p>
<h3>Eight Major American Film Companies Jointly Organize Export Association to Engage in Collective Trade Abroad</h3>
<p>[Reuters Hollywood, 24th] Eight major American film companies have formed a "Film Merchants Export Association." It is said that because of various restrictions on films in certain countries, the association will represent the eight major companies as an agency for group operations abroad. These countries include the Soviet Union, Austria, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, the Netherlands, the Dutch East Indies, Germany, Japan, and South Korea. The Council will represent the eight major companies in collective trade, distribution, and receipt of business in these foreign countries. The contract period is three years hereafter, but in Germany, Japan, and South Korea, the contract period is shorter, expiring after eighteen months.</p>

<h3>Abolish Concubinage</h3>
<p>— Wang Chongjia</p>
<p>Concubinage is inherently inhumane and a remnant of the autocratic era. In autocratic times, officials and nobles were often unrestrained and kept many concubines as instruments for their lust. No matter how favored they were, their status was very low. Ordinary people followed suit, using the excuse of wanting a son to take concubines. If they encountered a shrewish wife, the concubine would suffer.</p>
<p>Since the Republic of China, the vestiges of autocracy have not been eliminated. In the legal regulations, a concubine cannot be considered a member of the family. Most civilized countries have a monogamous system, and those with multiple wives are mostly barbaric and uncivilized people. China, as a dignified ancient country, calls itself civilized, but the custom of keeping concubines has not been eliminated. Some inferior women only seek vanity and admire the glory of the wealthy, willing to sacrifice their purity and become concubines. Frivolous and promiscuous women regard being a "second wife" as the only way out, which is a great shame for the women's world.</p>
<p>Now, society is shouting for women's liberation everywhere. The women's world can take this opportunity to awaken suddenly. Women who are unwilling to be slaves and who admire petty vanity can turn back and reflect.</p>
<p>Women</p>
<h3>Women's Success School</h3>
<p>— Mi Weiliang</p>
<p>On Fifth Avenue in New York, USA, there is a very special women's school. The students here range in age from eighteen to sixty or older; their weight ranges from eighty-four pounds to two hundred and twenty-two pounds, and the duration of each semester is only six weeks.</p>
<p>The students in the school come from all states of the United States. Why do they come here from afar? It turns out that they have lost their jobs, lost their husbands, and lost the opportunities for happiness in their lives. This school is called the Duberry Success School. Initially, most of the students who just entered the school were unfashionable women. Later, when they were about to graduate, they all became very beautiful women. Originally ordinary girls, they later became beautiful young women; those with dull minds became full of vitality and energy. When they entered, they seemed to have no inspiration, but when you came out, you were a confident and successful woman.</p>
<p>After entering the school, each student must be examined by a doctor and then photographed. This photo must be kept for six weeks, and when she is photographed again, she often does not believe that the person in the photo is herself. After that, measure her height, weigh her weight, and describe the advantages and disadvantages of her posture.</p>
<p>If her body is too fat, in the first week, she will eat some "slimming" foods. At the beginning, she still needs to take some medications, take two tablespoons of mineral oil every day, one tablespoon each before two meals a day, and take two pounds of milk of magnesia, and drink two cups of boiled water every day. If you feel a headache, cold, or uncomfortable, you can take ten grains of baking soda in capsules, and drink a cup of plain boiled water every hour. If you feel that your weight cannot be fully reduced, then you must also take the same weight of baking soda. Of course, you cannot eat white oil and salt at any time, and you must follow a light laxative method for six weeks.</p>
<p>Their special weight loss diet is prescribed as follows: The first thing in the morning must be done one hour before breakfast, which is to drink three cups of cold boiled water, followed by fitness exercises. Breakfast includes two oranges (eaten with the peel) and black coffee. At eleven o'clock, eat two more oranges. At one o'clock in the afternoon, have lunch, which includes beef soup or vegetable clear soup, tomato slices, and two oranges. At three-thirty, drink tomato juice and two oranges. At six o'clock in the evening, have the most abundant meal of the day; it includes celery soup, well-cooked vegetable slices, foreign potatoes, and tail food.</p>
<p>After that, she can listen to a recording of her own voice. After six weeks, she will be able to hear her new and pleasant voice.</p>
<p>Their classrooms are very airy, and their fitness exercises are specially designed. In their classrooms, you can hear the female teacher shouting the steps and beats in the fitness exercises in an impartial voice. Health and beauty are actually inseparable. According to the authorities of the success school, not only must these obese women lose weight and become slender (or make thin women gain weight), but they must also be taught how to walk, pick up things, work, push, carry, pull, and various movements. Not only must every muscle be suitable for health, but it must also be beautiful and elegant, and at the same time maintain a good posture.</p>
<p>After that, another teacher will teach the students how to paint their nails, beautify their faces, and eliminate defects.</p>
<p>If students cannot lose a lot of weight (or gain weight), then Swiss massage, swimming, etc. are added.</p>
<p>Later, she goes to the beauty salon to have a makeover, redesign her hairstyle, have a haircut, repaint the color of her nails, and remove blemishes from her face and eliminate stains. Her face, hands, upper legs, and lower legs are harmonized in color with massage, ointments, and skin cleansing lotions.</p>
<p>The dance class in the school curriculum is to enable them to have a balanced posture when dancing, and have self-confidence, so that they can attend social occasions at any time. When the students graduate, they are able to dance the conga, rumba, foxtrot, waltz, samba, etc.</p>
<p>After that, several teachers discuss and decide together which clothes and which colors will make her the most beautiful and attractive when she wears them, and also consider the student's economic ability.</p>
<p>Six weeks later, at graduation, we can see that the students here have become a group of energetic, well-postured, beautiful, and attractive women.</p>
<p>In the school on the road, nothing is nominal or hypothetical. They all take things seriously, work hard, and hope to get a good result.</p>
<h3>Figure 1: Attitude and posture are extremely important for women. Students are learning how to walk, with an object on their heads to maintain balance while walking. Figure 2: The teacher uses a machine to determine what type of skin the student's is.</h3>

<h3>I Become a Stepmother</h3>
<p>— Lao Dai</p>
<p>The increase of age has caused me to go from a young age to nearly middle age. As the old saying goes, "When a man is grown, he should marry; when a woman is grown, she should be married." Because of the difficulties of life, I could no longer delay at home to choose my ideal husband. This is something I still feel pain about today! As I am nearing middle age, I won't hide the fact that young men will no longer want me, so of course, I can only become a replacement wife. Under mutually agreeable conditions, I had to endure the humiliation of becoming the hated stepmother. However, I am very willing, I want to let the children in society know that stepmothers are not all vicious and shrewish, I want to break the deeply ingrained ideas that people have inherited through the ages, I want to add a unique luster to the women's world!</p>
<p>My husband is a man nearing forty years old. He is in business and is honest and sincere, truly worthy of the local character. His late wife left behind two children, who are still young. It is said that they were the last born, and the previous ones all died of illness. The family's life is still considered comfortable. After I entered the house, I began to take on the work of a housewife. The late wife's children were often worried and unhappy, suffering immensely, and my heart was also very pained for them. They are orphaned children who lost their kind mother, and hearing neighbors talk about how fierce and abusive stepmothers are and all kinds of terrible stories, how could they not tremble in their little hearts? But in order to fulfill my ambition, I would not become the kind of terrible stepmother they imagined. I often comforted and encouraged them with words, and I cared for them very much, so that they would recognize that stepmothers are not as vicious and terrible as people say.</p>
<p>The days passed quickly, and a year had passed before I knew it, and my body had also changed. The protruding belly made me feel unusually annoyed and troubled when doing things. But I still took care of their food and clothing as usual. I don't know why they have suddenly become silent and unhappy recently, holding a kind of vigilance and doubt towards me. I feel exceptionally pained. I don't know where I have treated them wrongly, or perhaps there is another reason? I wish I could dig out my heart and show it to them. But the fact is that I cannot do this, I can only hope that the child will come out soon, perhaps there is still a way to remedy things.</p>
<p>The child was born with a cry, but they are still the same, which makes me feel very depressed. Soon, I learned about their sudden change from the servants. It turns out that the stepmother's son was born, and of course, the stepmother loves her own son. Before, it was because she had no children! We finally could not escape the stepmother's "harshness and abuse." Alas! How sad is this? They are so pitiful. All kinds of bad situations of stepmothers in society have left a deep impression in their little hearts.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, the child I raised was already two years old. The swift passage of time really makes people feel its preciousness! I still pay attention to taking care of their food and clothing. Every time I go out, I always bring them some fruits and toys. When it comes to holidays, I take them out for a stroll. My own son enjoys the same treatment as them, sometimes they even get more. Every time they come back from school, I always prepare snacks to encourage them and teach them how to make progress in their studies. If they make a mistake, I don't beat or scold them, I only guide and teach them with words. When they sleep at night, I tell them stories of loyalty and righteousness from the ancients. All of this makes them feel the warmth of the family, and that stepmothers are not necessarily as terrible and vicious as people say.</p>
<p>Soon after, the often worried and unhappy look was no longer seen on their faces, but instead, they were filled with happy and innocent smiles, and the children also became lively and lovely. They often tease the younger brother and laugh, being as close and harmonious as hands and feet. Every time I see the three children playing together, ah! My heart is truly excited and happy, I have finally fulfilled my ambition! I am a good stepmother!</p>
