<p>問：政府是否計劃對東北中共佔領區，將有軍事行動，是否將</p>
<p>答：部分城市之得失，無足重視，全國版圖，均應在中央政府管轄之下，而其他方面，中央已被邀請參加全國之中央政權，故若干城市之歸還中央，中央不足以爲得，中共不足以爲失。</p>

<p>周氏稱不反對停戰</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕第三方面留滬各政協代表，昨仍繼續爲和平作最後之努力。二時四十分左右，張君勱。胡霖。李璜。偕訪周恩來會談，中共方面，陳家康亦在座。會談時笑聲達於庭中，足見空氣之和諧。關於會談內容，出席者均遵胡霖氏「儘少發表」之建議，秘不肯吐。張等於四時許辭出，周恩來陳家康皆送至門際，昨日有周氏離滬之謠，實係不確。胡霖氏對包圍之記者稱：「一無新聞可吿，但余因前未參加會談，今日已得悉過去會談情形，」可見張等必已將雷秘書長前日來滬後會談經過，轉吿周恩來。</p>
<p>中共方面，仍保守緘默。</p>
<p>張君勱氏歸寓後，五時許，曾與湯一鄕銘，蔣勻田，孫寳毅等民主社會黨各自要人物商談，孫寳毅曾出吿各記者：張氏正佇待雷秘書長由京打來之長途電話，希望能知政府方面，對第三方面各代表建議停戰及召開政協之意見</p>
<p>第三方面前日曾有建議將張家口及保定劃爲緩衝區者，惟多數代表均亟欲知政府對停戰令之態度，及發表時之方式。</p>
<p>李璜於離周恩來寓後，即往地豐路與靑年黨各領袖會談，夜七時許，曾聯袂至張君勱寓商議，衆料政府之答覆必巴到達，會談至展稿時仍在進行中。</p>
<p>〔本報訊㈡據昨日下午往訪周恩來氏之第三方面代表稱，周氏曾表示，並不反對停戰，亦不反對和談，惟對和談前途，則不敢稱有把握；故各代表所得之印象爲周氏態度已有　園之勢，目前或尙在等候延安之訓令而已。</p>

<p>〔路透社南京十六日電〕最近數月來，絕少對內政發表意見之蔣夫人，頃告印度自由新聞駐京記者稱，目前乃耐心容忍之時，期使對方得有表現其對和平統一確具誠意之機會，中國經八年抗戰，再遭饑荒，民生困苦已極，故目前最迫切之問題，即給人民以食物，此不僅爲經過戰爭及敵人佔領後之糧食短少問題，亦爲合理而有效之運輸間題，此則又常視國內之和平而定，國內未有和平，交通即無從暢達，經濟必隨之敗壞，國民黨本三民主義之精神，承爲有結束一黨統治制度之需要，當及早還政於民，使其得有所喜悅之政府，政府於一九三一年潘陽事件後，即一次作此嘗試，其後於一九三六年及一九三七年又再度努力，至今番已爲第四次矣，政府之定於十一月十二日召開國大，在爲結束一黨專政，還政於民，夫人繼調，人民得自由思想，均不免有政治意見之不同，然以政黨而用軍隊反抗政府，則係另一問題，苦苦指摘決無濟於事，吾人希望能成立協定，希望共黨能認識吾人應共同努力，爲中國人民之共同福利而工作。蔣夫人於談話時，對印度政局甚表關心，並對尼赫魯氏表示信任，記者繼以印度之統一見詢，夫人謂，各政黨意見不免不同，兩副頭腦當然不能有相司之思想，然僅在思想或討論方面意見不同，乃健全之現象，但若使用暴力，則將使局勢更惡化而危險矣。據悉「不列顛世界大事記」，請蔣主席夫婦撰文述中國抗戰經過，全文長約六千字，即可脫稿。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦十五日電〕英外交部發言人繼美國國務院之後，於今日鄭重否認波茨坦協定有附有關中國之密約之說。可靠方面相信，此軍傳說乃事後所公布雅爾達會議密約所引起之一種猜測，雅爾達之密約，乃特殊情形，意在應蘇聯決定對日宣戰而產生之環境，當波茨坦會議時，已無再訂密約之理由。此間消息靈通之華方人土亦不信波茨坦密約說，惟彼等同時鄭重表示，此事如果屬實，必遭中國政府堅强反對無疑。又據此間外交觀察家指稱：所傳密約內容，亦難令人置信，譬如密約規定外蒙與中國脫離一點，在雅爾達密約中，固曾規定外蒙地位不得變更，當時外蒙國仍屬於中國主權之下也。外蒙之獨立，乃中蘇自由談判，訂立一九四五年八月中蘇條約，規決由外蒙公民投票決定之結果，再如波茨坦密約規決分割刺鮮之說，事實上，刺鮮之未米地位，係三强於一九四五年十二月在莫斯科所討論經過已有公報發表，三强當時議定設立朝鮮全國之臨時政府，在四強托管下治理五年，美蘇目前雖尙未能議定臨時政之組織，但亦顯然未有分割之意。再如密約建議中國政府容納共黨之說，亦與事實不符，馬歇爾將軍雖力圖調解國共糾紛，然停戰猶不可得，更罔論聯合政府矣。至於美英同意准許蘇聯於中國組織聯合政府不成後，在華自由行動之說，則更屬荒謬，事實證明美蘇兩國對中國局勢，意見大不相同，何來同意之說。觀察家且覺蘇聯在決定本於已責自由行動之前，勢須先向西方國家徵求意見云。</p>

<p>〔本報漢口十六日電〕漢市倒閉風日熾，工礦銀行襄理徐旭麟，以金融投機失敗，又於日前捲款潛逃。按徐所捲逃之款，共達二億七千萬元，多係向各錢莊挪借者（多者每家八千萬元），故自徐走後，連日金融界頓感極度恐慌，曾於昨日召開緊急會議，商討對策。</p>

<h3 id="c45">提高對日警覺！ <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>對義·羅·匈·保·芬五國的和約草案，業經這次廿一國和會通過，只要四國外長會作最後決定，就可以簽字成立了。這是廿一國致力和平的初步成功；今後還要從事更艱鉅更繁重的工作，以締結對德對日的和約。據美國國務卿貝爾納斯的表示，四國外長在紐約出席聯合國大會期間，就要開始討論德國問題，至聯合國大會閉幕後，重往歐洲，將德國問題作一全面的研究，俾能獲致對德和的的成立。對日和約問題，雖然還要在對德問題之後，始能涉及；但是料計今天離開對日和會開幕的日期，不會十分遼遠了。美國國務院對於對日和約，早已在那裏研究和起草，此在日本方面，對於巴黎和會的成就，更有非常敏銳的感覺，而認爲對日和會開幕的日期，就在眼前了。</p>
<p>據法國新聞社十二日東京電，日本政界人士刻正以一駭人聽聞的秘密文件，私相授受，究其內容，乃在說明日本對於對日和會所懷有的目標，並揭　若干指導原則，俾作爲日本參加和會代表團的參考。同時日本外交界人士，更在那裏研究以前的凡爾賽和約以及甫經巴黎和會通過的五種和約草案，看到盟國處處顧全義國，無不表示欣慰，而認爲將來　國對於日本依照種族，歷史，及經濟的理由提出的領土及經濟要求，必能加考慮。所以最近幾個月來，日本人又在那裏笑了，又在那裏做着美麗的迷夢了；使我們不能不提高對於日本的警覺。而隨時粉碎日本人所做着的美妙的迷夢。</p>
<p>第一，日本人以爲日本在遠東所處的地位，正與義大利在歐洲所處的地位相同；這完全是日本人的一種錯覺，也可以說日本人的「如意算盤」。義大利在第二次世界大戰中，是一個從犯，僅跟了納粹德國搖旗吶喊而已；而且在戰爭的末期，義國軍民的反法西斯鬥爭，對於盟國的獲勝，有極大的貢獻。所以世界各國都認爲與義大利締結和約，不妨溫和寬大。但是日本是第二次世界大戰的禍首罪魁，不但首先破壞和平，從事侵略中國的戰爭；而且先發制人，首先向英美宣戰；及至德國投降之後，日本猶負隅抵抗，直至山窮水盡之後，始無條件投降。所以盟國對於日本，雖然不願採取報復政策，但是決不能過分寬大。和對待義國一樣。</p>
<p>第二，日本人深信在美蘇之間，日後必將發生戰事，並認爲美蘇戰事是日本唯一的出路；日人每次聽到美蘇兩大集團對峙的消息，即自然而然流露出愉快的表情。所以我們不得不正吿日本朝野人士，不能戴了有色眼鏡，觀察國際局勢，而應正視現實；日人素以「目光如豆」見稱於世，對於國際大勢，往往認識不淸。即以目下世界大局而論，美蘇因爲思想的不同與利害的衝突，欲求其處處意見一致，固不可能；但謂美蘇戰爭將來終不能避免，似屬皮相之見；至少在今日，美蘇同樣需要和平，同樣需要合作。沒有一國願見戰禍之再起。在歐洲，雖在無形中有東歐與西歐之分；但是英國前首相邱吉爾鼓吹歐洲合衆國始終未能獲得大多數歐洲人民的歡迎。在遠東方面，美蘇對於如何管制日本，或有各不相同的見解，但是絕無集團對峙的形勢，尤其是中國願見美蘇合作，而不願意美蘇分道揚鑣故能竭盡所能，作爲美蘇間的橋樑，從中調和，促成雙方的諒解與合作。所以在美蘇之間，雖然常常發生齟齬，但是仍向着世界和平的目標，共同努力。</p>
<p>第三，日本人士聞及我國王外長世杰在巴黎宣佈對日政策，質言之；即（一）中國在戰時雖蒙受重大損失，但不提出超過日本償付能力之賠款要求;（二）至起草對日和約時，　中國不採取報復政策；（三）中國的對日政策，與美國的對日政策，大體相同；（四）締造和平，應以正義爲基礎。日人因此就發生了許多錯誤的幻覺，而以爲日本將來所提出的要求，必能獲得盟國的考慮，益感日太的前途，大有可爲。再加以太平洋盟軍最高統帥麥克阿瑟元帥的管制日本的政策，最近已由嚴厲而變爲溫和；更增添了日人樂觀的因素。但是我們要使日本人士明瞭：「寬大」決不是「縱容」，「溫和」決不是「姑息」，中國對日所以不採報復政策，麥帥管制日本所以不採取嚴峻措置，這都是爲了遠東的和平，也就是爲了世界和平。而非容許日本在暗中重整軍備以培養她的侵略勢力之謂。日人企圖保留琉球羣島，更是荒唐的夢想。</p>
<p>麥帥在九月三日日本簽降一週年紀念日發表文吿稱：「日本今後在世界上所處的地位，將爲和平的堡壘呢？抑將爲走向戰爭的跳板呢？」這一句警語，是值得世人自惕的。尤其在日本沉浸在迷夢中的今天，就是在負責管制日本的麥帥，對於日本人的陰謀也要提高警覺，隨時加以防範。</p>
<h3 id="c46">印度內爭解決了！ <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>印度問題，因爲回敎聯盟的領袖眞納，不肯加入尼赫魯組織臨時政府，釀成印回兩族許多流血的事件，加爾各答和孟買的暴動，陳屍街道，鷹隼啄食，尤慘絕人寰。據最近的消息，眞納已經與英國駐印總督魏菲爾會晤，並同國大領袖尼赫魯磋商，始決定加人臨時政府，　盟五個部長的人選也已於前天，由魏菲爾總督發表了，這是尼赫得以容忍的精神達到印　合作的一大成功。中印的關係，素來就是友好的。我們一直盼望印度內部能够早日統一，同心協力，在最近的將來，獲得眞正的獨立。</p>
<p>過去回敎聯盟的領袖所以堅持主張建設回族獨立的巴基斯坦，最主要的原因，到不是宗敎習慣的不同。世界上許多宗敎不同的民族，都能够共同相處在一個國家，中國和美國就是明例。在印度雖然印回中間，有時不免磨擦，然而也相處了多年，就是現在回敎徒最多的六省中間，也有三千多萬的印度人。一九四零年三月第一次宣佈巴基斯坦計劃的眞納，在上次歐戰期間，也主張印回合作，而且譯爲只有印回團結，印度纔可以眞正獨立。</p>
<p>眞納政治主張改變的原因，還是由於一九三六到一九三七年關，國大黨在省選舉中佔了絕大的勝利。這使眞納感覺，俄如印回合作，印度人一定會憑藉多數來壓迫少收，回敎徒在政府中間，不能多有保障自己權利的力最。他想與其聯合而受壓迫，不如獨立而得自由。這在情理上來說，眞納的巴基斯坦計劃也未可厚非。</p>
<p>但是眞納的主張是錯誤的。第一在經濟方面，印回必須合作。回敎徒大部分居住的地方，人民都很窮苦，工商業毫不發達，只有和大都市暢通有無，和比較西化的印度互相帮助，纔可以解決目前經濟的壓迫，逐漸建設將來的基礎。第二在政治方面，印度龐大的人口，廣闊的土地，豐富的資源，難免不遭野心國家的覬覦。英國雖然讓印度獨立，但是英國並沒有撤軍，以後英印的關係到底如何演變，還要看印度人本身的努力。在這種險惡的國際環境之下，印回兩族更不能分裂，只有聯合的陣綫，纔可以抵禦外侮，獲得眞正的自由。至於軍事方面，回敎徒素來佔重要的地位。假如今後印度的國防，不再假手外國，逐漸由自己建設，那麼回族對於眞正獨立的印度，還可以有偉大的貢獻。然而這種貢獻，也只有印回合作，纔可以成功。</p>
<p>至於多數少數的問題，不過是一個政治技術的問題。如像政府閣員名額的規定，選舉方法的改變，使回敎徒的領袖能够在新政府中間，充分代表八千萬回民的利益，這也並不是不可以解決的問題。國大的領袖尼赫魯對於回族並沒有歧視，國大黨重要代表中也有四人。臨時政府閣員的席次，也表示願意多讓。只要眞納不堅持印回分立，回敎徒將來無論在政治經濟　事社會各方面，決不會遭受任何的壓迫。</p>
<p>至於以前在九月三日，眞納曾經對新開記者暗示，回敎徒可能投入蘇聯的懷抱。我們當時就相信，眞納沒有誠意，不　作出一種政治的姿態，以威脅魏算爾和尼赫魯。中國古語說：「兄第　於　，外祭其侮。」印回兩族，本來是兄弟，六十年來他們都在共同携手，反抗英國的治，想建設眞納所謂「自由聯合的印度」，到今天爲着內部的爭鬥，却另外招致一個强大的國家，造成新的糾紛，新的控制，這非印度之福，也非世界之福。</p>
<p>現在眞納已經覺悟了尼赫魯也讓步了，自此印回之爭，也就可以消滅於無形了，印度的前途，即將顯示出光明。只要　內能够統一，爭取獨立終必能成功。所以我們祝望他們，早日成功，建設一個獨立自由的新國家。至於他們擺脫外力，捐　成見，終於達到統一的目的。這一個好模樣在今天的中國，實在值得我們參考。</p>

<p>把握農閒</p>
<p>首由沈主席致開會詞，闌述此次水利交通會議之意義，謂可解決人民衣食住行之四大需要，全部工程下月初發動，庶可把握冬令農閒，視緩急而先後施行，一切務求具體化。繼由各區專員分別報吿，大都爲力言水利交通之重要，而急求消災求福，一區急需疏濬南湖。二區西山東山水淹己三四次，亟須防止。三區要務在整治浦陽江浙贛綫與重建錢江南岸碼頭。四區金華江東陽南北二江爲二條爛肚腸，不獨急須治江，且應從速造林。五區修建衢江流域水閘。六區修疏曹娥江及寗紹一帶水利交通。浙南山地及沿海區域側重農田水利。</p>
<p>經費來源</p>
<p>據建設　皮廳長報吿，整治水利交通爲浙省當前急務，決不因經濟困難而停頓，故建築工程應與行政機關在工作上取得密切聯繫，至經費來源，則有四：（一）根據核定之方案，再呈請中央撥付，中央猶需補撥四十餘億元；（二）省方撥助三億元水利二億五千元交通；（三）工賑委會請行總浙閩分署撥助麪粉，以工代賑，水利一萬三千噸，交通一萬二千六百噸；（四）發動國民義務勞動，不用民財，但需利用民力，在建廳未徵收水利工程經費前，則先請農行貸款一億一千萬元。</p>
<p>義務勞動</p>
<p>下午開預備會議前，，沈主席又致調，謂全部工程十一月一日起至明年底完成，而明年三月底前爲主要期，望利用農閒，多發動義務勞動，在水利方面，大型工程特別注意防洪測量計劃，己完成小型工程除寗紹杭嘉湖外，山區各縣須大規模進行，預期三年完成，俾使旱地可不靠天吃飯，具體計劃表己　訂，惟須研究，擬先自三門縣辦起，成立墾區，並重蘭墾，擬派貢沛誠赴沿海實地考察。</p>
<p>築路原則</p>
<p>交通方面，國道已由工路總局派工程隊修理，省道之整理，先修（一）段前已有路跡而易於修復者，（二）沿海各地或通國道而有經濟價値者，（三）邊區山地可用爲治安防匪者。縣通則注重（一）連接各縣可通省道者，（二）可發展當地特產而有經濟價値者，並注意鄕村電話網之普遍佈置。至於人事機構，水利方面在省成立水利參事會，以河流爲單位，合數縣而成，並以水利工程處配合之，各縣　改水利委員會爲水利協會，各鄕保則成立水利合作社。交通方面，省或行政區域成立交通修理委員會，各縣設立交通協會。繼關預備會議。明日分水利交通兩組審查各項提案。</p>

<p>新生羣北上成問題</p>

<p>〔路透社紐倫堡十六日電〕林突在獄服毒自殺，兩小時半後十名納粹戰犯即在監獄健身房內，於照耀如畫之燈光下，一一步登十三級之紋台實行絞決。第一名絞決者爲希特勒　外長李實特洛甫，時爲上午一時十一分，最末一人爲股嘉德，時爲上午二時四十五分（上海時間上午九時四十五分。執行完畢後，看管納粹戰犯之四國委員團發表公報，證明各犯已依法執行，戈林則係服毒自殺，於晚十時四十五分畢命。巴維利亞省長霍格納。紐倫保首席檢察官萊斯納，以德國人民證人之資格，檢視戈林之屍體。戈林臥於床上以一小玻璃管之靑砒（　化鉀）塞入口中，在醫師及牧師趕到以前，其喉中作聲，即吿畢命。當局於今晨已從事調查，以發見毒藥如何運入。戈林於死前曾草遺書二通儲於俗一信封內，其一似係致典獄長者。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐倫堡十六日電〕關於戈林於處決前突然自殺一事，刻已組織三人委員會，進行調查。據美方新聞處官員麥克納耳稱：該委會將由某美軍官任主席，惟對三委員姓名則未宣佈，目前尙未逮捕亦未擬逮捕任何人。叩以是否將逮補戈林之妻，麥氏僅將以上所云又述一遍。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐倫堡十六日電〕在納粹戰犯十一名處刑前，監中戒備森嚴，每一獄室之前，均有美軍衛兵駐守，不斷視察，每兩小時調班一次。被判死刑之納粹戰犯，每夜就寢時必須背向牆壁，兩手露於被外，在睡眠中偶然備身，衛兵即入內使其恢復原狀，因此隨時可以觀察其面部。在行刑一小時前，衛兵之數量大增，哨兵均備湯姆遜輕機槍與手槍，納粹戰犯決無逃避絞決之希望。但突然間，不可能之事情竟發生矣：戈林睡於床上，背向牆壁，並不違背規則，但忽作怪聲，其時爲昨夜十時四十五分。衛兵自小洞中望入，見狀後極爲驚慌，立即通知衛隊長，衛隊長立即召醫師及牧師前來，衝入監獄，則見戈林橫陳床上，巳氣絕矣。戈林自殺之官方公吿，係由監獄司令官美軍安杜斯上校宣佈，渠稱：目下正在調查戈林如何能　藏毒藥，因各犯之衣服每日均經極嚴格搜查。至於毒藥之性質，顯與一般納粹份子所携帶以及戈林於送入獄中時在其身上所搜獲者相同。</p>
<h3 id="c73">行刑一瞥　臨終遺言各犯不同 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐倫堡十六日電〕德國悲劇之最後一幕，今晚在紐倫堡獄中刑塲表演。納粹要犯十名在絞架受首，戈林則事先服毒自殺。戈林自殺之消息係由法庭警長於午夜發表，頗引起震驚。法庭爲防繼續發生意外起見，其他各犯上紋臺時，均帶上手銬而行。刑塲設於密室中，置紋架三具，漆成墨綠色，在室中矗立，其中兩架係輪流使用，另一架備而不用。監斬者凡四十五人，包括盟國管制委員會四代表·衛隊·軍醫·新聞記者八人及譯員等。絞架底層有厚幕遮掩，一俟機關撥動，屍體吊起時，即被遮沒。李賓特洛浦（前外長）首先入塲，經譯員騐明正身，李犯拾級登絞台，到達合頂時，譯員問其尙有遺言否？李犯答稱，希望世界和平，並要求上帝拯救德國。言畢，兩劊子手即以繩圈套入其頸內，機關撥動，砰然一聲巨嚮，其回聳有如發砲，震破室中沉寂，李犯身體即沒入幕內。其餘各犯依决行刑，每次刑畢，由軍醫檢明死絕，然後移去屍體。各犯最後遺言，各各不同。蘇克爾（前衝鋒隊領袖）希望保護德國。郁特爾（前陸軍參謀長）高呼「德國萬歲」。殷嘉德（前奧地利與荷蘭佔領區總督）希望此次行刑，結束第二次世界大戰最後一幕悲劇。季合爾（前陸軍總司令）要求上帝憐惜德國人民，並喊「爲國犧牲一切」。卡丹勃倫堡（前保安警察局長）稱：「盡忠報國，死而後已」。史特萊徹（著名猶太劊子手）奔入刑場時，高呼「希特勒萬歲」，旋又嘶聲喊：「共產黨總有一天也要絞死你們的，再會」。忽又鎭靜而充滿樂觀云：「上帝吾父，我來了！」最後呼喊「愛特爾，我的愛妻」。弗朗克（前波蘭總督）臨死並無一言，最後行刑者爲弗里克（前捷克保護地總督），高呼「永生的德國萬歲」。至午前二時五十二分，最後之紋繩切斷，屍體移出，大功吿成。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐倫堡十六日電〕繼李賓特洛甫赴絞台受刑者爲季臺爾，基氏死時穿着制服及黑靴，態度冷靜，與受鞠時同。當其手銬解去而以皮帶束縛時，渠昻首而立。渠昇登最後十三級至絞台時，態度莊軍，猶如登檢閱台向士兵答禮然，一種驕橫倨傲之態，十足代表普魯士軍官之氣概。在塲觀衆一致認爲受絞刑之十人中，以季台爾最爲勇敢。基氏以完全而淸晣之語調發出其臨終遺言稱：「願上帝保佑德國人民。兩百餘萬德國軍人已先余爲國捐軀，余今追隨彼等於地下。余不畏死，余視死如歸，一切爲德國而犧牲」！基氏生時爲一軍人，死時仍爲一軍人。</p>

<p>〔聯合社紐倫堡十五日電〕德國十一名紋犯現僅餘最後數小時之生命，各犯最後一次晚餐甚爲簡單，僅粥一盆，麵包數片及咖啡一杯而已，據獄吏稱，各犯尙能自持，此輩將於午夜後行刑。死沉沉之空氣今夜已厚厚籠罩於黑暗之紐倫堡監獄，劊子手亦整裝以待。首先行刑聞爲戈林，繼之以李賓特洛甫。午夜前數小時，紐倫堡天空冰冷灰暗，有寒雨或下雪之兆。監獄四周駐有美軍勁旅嚴密守衛，以防刧獄，凡無特殊要公者，均不得入獄。飛機亦不准經過上空。</p>
<p>戈林疊接怪信</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕東北淪陷十四年，國人生命財產之犧牲於日軍鐵蹄卞者，不可勝數。今値天日重光，日敵降服，各地日本戰犯，正陸續受我國國法之制裁。十四年來之暴行，宜可淸算。乃此項罪犯，今日已另得棲身之所，遂致逍遙法外！</p>
<p>戰犯處理委員會東北督導組從東北歸來，據該組組長（即國防部戰犯管理處處長）鄒任之氏，在昨日歡迎茶會上所述，日寇所爲種種奴化及毒化東北情形，實足令人髮指。鄒氏首將該組此次由束北帶回之日軍罪證照片四十餘幀，詳加解說。內中若千照片，俱爲日軍鍘殺同胞，裂屍活祭等等，令人慘不忍睹。繼報吿東北日戰犯之實况稱：東北日軍至少在六七十萬人左右，而現剩留東北者竟祗爲極少數而不甚重要之一部，其中經民衆以戰犯罪檢舉在案者，以整個東北面積之大，乃僅二三百人，內中將少將竟祗各有二三人而已！</p>
<p>東北近況</p>
<p>鄒氏於述及東北近狀時稱：日人向視東北爲日本之一部，故溥儀稱「帝」而不稱「皇」，偽組織中人，且須稱日本爲「親邦」。文字語言，亦皆已受到文影響，稱爲「協和語」，如我人於結束語氣稱「完了」，而東北同胞，竟已代之爲「以上」。靑年學生，智力允在水準以下。此渝陷十四年間，日人在東北確已相當建設，惟流盡血汗者，皆我東北同胞，而日人則坐收其利。每年動員之同胞達百餘萬人，而東北最著者名之小　滿發電廠建設時，同胞因工作致死者竟達三十餘萬人之多！至日憲兵隊毒害愛國同胞，允足令人髮指，有通往各處之地下道，高闊約二三丈，密佈小室，皆所謂「秘密室」者。凡被視爲思想上「反滿抗日」者，即在此受其虐害。甚至全村鎭皆被「討伐」，而將同胞全數殺害。　日人毒化陰謀，其證據在東北者更到處皆是，如潘陽東門外有「禁烟局工塲」，實即製造鴉片之機關，此外尙有海洛英工廠，嗎啡廠等。</p>
<p>婦女失踪</p>
<p>東北收復後，國軍未能即行進駐，秩序遂又混亂。收復時，曾發現有婦女二萬餘人，竟吿失踪！又因日僑婦女之嫁中國人者，可免遺送，故匆促與國人結婚者極多，已登記者，有五千對。日僑因屢經變亂，生活大都不甚寬裕，日女淪爲賣笑者允多，彼等中梅毒極見盛行。　京滬一帶，目前房荒極見嚴重，但東北則有屋多人少之現象。至僞滿女影星。則幾全已與留駐該地之美軍結婚。</p>
<p>「又訪」戰犯督導組一行五人，已於昨夜晋京述職。該組各代表此次前往東北，曾搜獲村料甚多，茲分別誌後，籍窺日人在東北之暴行：</p>
<p>暴行實錄</p>
<p>（一）瀋陽「大檢舉」民國廿年十二月上旬，瀋陽南測蘇家宅附近鐵嶺開源大石橋等地，有義勇軍破壞鐵路事件發生。日軍駐瀋陽憲兵隊長森田少佐，指使部屬於瀋陽市內外大肆拘捕，連續二週之久。遭逮捕者共四百餘名。經審訊後認爲有一百卅餘名犯罪，內中包括黨政人員，憲兵軍官等。其中有黨人譚甘，於夜間越獄逃出，同行者的七十人。於是日軍乃遷怒其餘朱逃之衆，酷刑拷打後，並濫捕家屬及關係者達四百人，酷刑致死者的一百六十名。</p>
<p>（二）安東「大檢舉」民廿一年四月安東縣「警察局」指導官日人大町者，於戶口調査時，發現可疑信件，將黨人高某拘捕。於是實行檢舉抗日份子，並波及瀋陽·營口各地，被捕浙共達一千五百餘名，其中生還者僅十餘人耳。</p>
<p>（三）吉林「大撿舉」（即毓文中學事件）九一八後，北平東北黨務辦事處負責者劉剛中，派劉靜嵐。鄭之寬等至吉林，與該地黨人互相聯繫，組織抗日救國會。民廿四年二月初，因匯款問題，被僞滿吉林警察廳發覺，當時被捕者有六十餘人。內中毓文巾學校長李光漢等四人，均於嚴刑下死於獄中。其餘均判結徒刑，至民廿六年釋出。然而精神失常、身體殘廢矣。</p>
<p>又民國二十三年五月，吉林磐山縣境。王殿臣率衆欲破壞鐵路，機密洩露，被日軍逮捕，罹難者達數千人。</p>
<p>（四）哈爾濱事件民二十六年十二月，哈爾濱之愛國志士數人，與松黑一帶義勇軍約期舉事於哈爾濱北側之松浦，受漢奸董某密吿偽滿濱江警察廳，動員檢舉，搜殺殆盡，無一倖免。此即所謂「一二·三一」事件。</p>
<p>（五）東邊道「大討伐」事件民二十三年至二十五年，二十七年至二十九年，日軍於「柬邊道」兩次大討伐，受害者約六千餘人。焚燒村落房屋不計其數，當時日軍中有某中佐專嗜殺人，被其手刃者約一百六十人。</p>
<p>（六）敦化地區之大掃蕩民廿五年冬，日軍開始敦化至鏡波湖地區之「大掃蕩」。指揮官月野中佐等，燒村殺人，慘絕人寰。受害者多至三四千人，村舍成墟，災民遍野。且時値隆冬，受凍餒而死者，更莫能計其數。</p>
<p>（七）陳翰章事件民廿七年夏，吉林中學敎師陳翰章，被迫起義，聞風響應者達四五千人，活躍於吉林中部山林地帶。以是日軍大舉「討伐」，陳部力不能抗，多死於難，退隱蘇境。翌年春復出擊，曾劫奪敦化及明月溝等地僞軍警之武器，後因受敵僞軍之追擊，退至敦化東面大荒溝地方，彈盡糧絕，陳受傷自殺，所部大半被一屠殺。</p>
<p>（八）一二·三〇「大檢舉」事件民三十年十二月三十日，敵僞於東北全境發動「大檢舉」，被檢舉者總數達三百五十五名，後交僞滿司法部處理，起訴者一百九十三名，不起訴者八十七名，判處死刑者九名，無期徒刑十八名。詳見僞滿司法部型事司僞康德十一年六月編印之「一二·三〇事件之槪貌」一書。</p>
<p>（九）撫順平頂山慘案民二十一年陰歷八月十五日夜，唐聚五部義勇軍進攻撫順礦區，曾山平頂山經過。因煤礦之栗家溝工人賣店主事人管誠一假借被竊盜名義，勾串當地日軍警憲及煤礦日人等集合平頂山千金寨東山，於十六日下午二時。集中平頂山西側山崖下之西山。全體村民三百五十戶約五千名，舉火焚燒，並以機槍掃射，復衝入西山，於亂屍叢中，以刺刀刺殺重傷未死者六十餘人。得生者僅十餘名。關於此案，本年八月，東北保安司令長官部最近已捕獲與太案有關之戰犯唐田繁·高橋慶雄·西山茂作及拓植豐等四名。</p>
<p>（十）「關東州警察局」之罪行調查據「關東局施政三十年史」（民廿五年昭和十一年版）第廿四章第五節「滿洲事變與關東局警察官檢舉反滿抗日份子及宣撫工作記載」稱：東北之政治」匪」，思想「匪」，宗敎「匪」等廿五萬，在日軍實施對反「滿」抗日份子之大剿滅時，相繼拘捕「正法」。內中並詳載人「犯」姓名，逮捕年月甚詳。</p>
<p>（十一）萬寳山慘案萬寳山慘案於民廿年春開始，亦爲日本侵華主要事件之一。其經過情形，歷史上均詳載記之。近悉此慘案之禍首郝永德，即事件發生時利用韓人以擴大事件者，已經我新六軍督察組捕獲，送交長春警備司令部軍法處訊辦中。</p>
<p>（十二）毒化政策　其次，此次東北督導組對於敵僞在東北實施毒化政策之眞相，亦作一詳細之調査。緣「九一八」事變以前，日人利用「滿鐵」附屬地租界地爲據點，包庇運售太量毒品。日總領事不予禁止，反獎勵日商販賣。至民二十一年僞政府爲謀增加其財政，乃樹立鴉片專賣制度，於僞經濟部內，設立專置總局，下設專買署，及專買局（共一百〇八局），專買分局（共一百九十局）。許可之烟館爲二千一百所。阪賣鴉片量爲一千三百萬兩。製造毒品工廠在瀋陽，鴉片原料地方爲熱河。其製造之大量鴉片以「福·祿·壽·喜·松·竹·梅·蘭」等商標，獎勵推銷。民國二十七年停止鴉片專買，移交「民生部」，成立「禁烟總局」，下設「康生院」百四十五所，「營烟所」一千八百所。至此，鴉片公賣之制度表面上撤消，實由「民生部」兼賣。迨至民卅年太平洋戰爭後，日人擬增加財政之收人，廢止各地之「康生院」，增加鴉片之賣出數量。又復盡量擴充鴉片，栽種地區，除熱河省外，遼寗，遼北，吉林等省，實行大量集團種植鴉片。並大量輸送至南京，上海一帶傾銷。至有關鴉片之日罪犯，有主張鴉片專賣者，有實施毒化者，開禁主謀者，請求鴉片生產者，內中包括主張在遼寗，遼北，吉林栽種鴉片之罪魁梅本長四郞，南京一帶鴉片販賣者津末圭二等數十人。</p>

<p>中央航空公司，以福建厦門爲沿海重鎭，爲便利該地交通，特闢滬厦綫。試航工作，業已完成，短期內即將決定開航日期及票價以後往返滬港之中央公司班機，即於厦門降落。又中央公司因各項飛機另件缺乏，汽油不充足，人員不够調派，故年內除增闢滬厦綫外，不擬增派其他航空綫。</p>

<p>經濟新聞社社長束北行轅經濟委員會專門委員在沿津氏，最近應張主任委員嘉璈電約飛瀋，日前返滬，發表東北觀感如下：（一）東北九省民衆愛國心，不下於關內。希望和平，尤爲殷切。（二）東北九省之經濟秩序，已日漸恢復，經濟負責當局張公權氏，極盼年靑有志之士，前往埋頭苦幹，建設新東北。（三）瀋陽金融狀况良好，子金低廉，一般人民均無利息頭腦，投機家無存在可能。故東北可稱爲「實幹者的樂園」。（四）東北工業，雖遭摧毁，然亦不必太可惜。因日本過去之經濟建設，完全配合其軍事侵略，如照常維持，與我國國情亦不合。實有重定經濟建設計劃之必要。（五）東北最缺少者，爲棉布與工業原料，可運出者爲雜糧，當局歡迎以貨易貨。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕滬揚綫口岸班自勝利以來，因該處情形特殊，無輪航行，最近八達公司派機帆船華近號試航，由滬直駛口岸，四日一班，中途不靠他港。據該公司稱：該處地方已趨安謐，惟來貨依然寥寥，僅鷄鴨蛋類等，乘客因不明地方情形，去者甚稀，聞同興航業公司，亦將開闢口岸班。</p>
<p>南北洋綫運輸，邇來略見淸淡，因南洋綫受棉紗棉布禁運閩粵兩省影響，北洋綫受滬市貨價高昻之故。至南北洋運滬進口貨，亦全賴藥材水菓之類，至福建之木料存貨充足，一時不易運完。</p>
<p>達興輪已發遷　中國航運公司天龍輪，昨日首次開航秦皇島，因檢騐手續未完備，航政局阻制出口，另行補辦手續。達興公司達興輪，前被敵偽徵用，勝利後經招商局接收，改名江利號，行駛長江綫，達興公司經理徐忠信即申請敵僞處理局轉咨招商局發還，該局業於十四日遵照院令發還，當由該公司徐忠信簽署接收。</p>
<p>美輪來滬減少</p>
<p>美國海員第二次罷工，迄今尙＼未解決，影響船期至鉅，來華之美輸逐漸减少。茲據美國總統輪船公司宣稱：本月份由美來滬之船隻，至目下爲止，祇有三輪，客輪曼林蘭克斯號已於十五午到埠，貨輪蒙脫台維斯號昨日抵滬，尙有貨輪蒙脫勞格斯號，約下週到滬，其餘預定來滬之客貨船，均遭罷工之影響，本月內已不及來滬。曼林蘭克斯號郵船原定今日起椗駛南洋，因手續不及，改明日下午一時離滬，經香港至小呂宋，由菲島直接返美，不再來滬。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市印染工廠，自一度將於不景氣之陰　中，幾經奮鬥圖存，刻已呈顯一綫曙光。昨據某印染業鉅子語記者：最近印染業之轉機，純由於印花嗶嘰及士林布等暢銷所致。此種布疋銷路，且以本市爲大宗。緣本市勞工大衆，自工資津貼逐月＼按照生活指數調整以來，收人普遍增加，購買力亦較强。値此秋冬季節，布疋實銷遂暢。天津，北平，漢口等地，各擋布疋市價，與本市相差無幾，且常發生倒掛情形，故外銷反不若本市之暢達。至目前之印染業，胥視所備原料及染料是否充份，爲獲利之準繩，蓋染料一項，花色繁多。且匯率調整後，已漲價百分之一百。而德孚配貨，仍屬不敷所需。然印仍較染之利潤爲優厚。以印花嗶嘰言，坏布每疋六萬元，加工印染後，每疋可售十萬元，此中每疋可淨賺一萬元。染方面姑以一九〇士林布爲例，所用原坯，爲普通中擋細布，每疋爲八萬元，加工染色後，每疋可售十三萬元。惟此巾單以士林染料而言，每疋已扯二萬五千元以上。故再加工銀及利息耗損結果，已無利潤可言。現聞本市各大小印染廠，出貨多屬供不應求。某廠定貨，且已遠至十一月。然一方面工業界今日普遍之威脅，如高工資，高利貸，及雜稅等問題，在該業亦未能例外。渠等：印染業當前首要之圖，尙在抓取目前一息之轉機，多多鞏固基礎，擴張規模，增加生產，俾使每一單位之生產成木，能因而比例遞减，俾使售價愈减，銷路愈暢，由本市外埠而擴展至南洋一帶，則印染業固有其樂觀之前程云。</p>

<h3 id="c192">李銳五萬石軍糧案 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 九月廿三日長沙訊　黃潮如</p>
<p>這旁卸任　被控貪污未審結</p>
<p>那廂接事　鬼鬼祟祟問題多</p>
<p>今年長沙最聳人觀聽的新聞，除了卸任財廳長兼省田糧處長胡邁的被訴貪污案之外，當推李銳的「五萬石軍糧案」了。目下，胡邁貪污案尚在審訊中。現任湘財廳長兼省男糧處長李銳，他就是接坐胡邁那把交椅的，照理，有前車之鑒，以胡邁那樣的小心翼翼，尚不免瑯璫入獄，身繫囹圄，終應該好好的幹一番了，誰料竟又發生了一個轟動一時的「五萬石軍糧」案子。</p>
<p>參議員提出質詢　田糧處大發新聞</p>
<p>這件案子是省參議會提出質詢的，幾經轉折，現在雖尚未到確定田糧處有舞弊情事的階段，可是事實已很明顯的擺在那裏，無法掩飾了。</p>
<p>此案的經過，大略如此：省田糧處於本年六月底各縣配購糧榖奉令停購後，七月至九月份需糧七萬餘包，折榖十九萬餘石，必需另購備撥。又五月底以前，各縣普遍糧荒，配購糧征收困難，致使配撥軍糧積欠達八萬包以上。又另奉參謀總長電飭分在長沙等地籌撥屯糧一萬一千大包，該處爲預籌糧源使軍糧源源接濟，不虞中斷起見，除加緊接運贛糧調補外，並採購一部，計先後委托中原公司，民國大學生　管理處各承購榖一萬石，又託湘供應局發部隊代金榖三萬石（如需實物，由該局代爲酌購）。以上共計五萬石。共糧按中央核定價格訂爲每石一萬三千五百元，交貨地點則在長沙。</p>
<p>上述情形，表面上並無絲毫毛病。尤其令你信任的是其時長沙米價較訂購榖價爲高，誰又能否認我們的李廳長不重視公帑，使公家不吃虧。然而，細細研究起來，則其事又大謬不然，令人懷疑的地方却還是很多。</p>
<p>此事經過省參議會提出質詢，田糧處除答覆該會外，並發表一篇很長的新聞稿，解釋訂購榖米的經過，其着重　仍不外訂購榖價比當時長沙米價低，以明其毫無弊端暨節省公帑的苦心。</p>
<p>對答復表不滿　提出第二次質詢</p>
<p>此後，省參議會並不認爲「答覆圓滿」於駐會委員會第二十次會議中，又提出了第二次質詢：</p>
<p>「第一，糧價問題，來文所舉糧價爲長沙市價，而購榖地點實爲濱湖產糧區域，究竟在訂約時至交貨時之間，濱湖糧價實需若干？</p>
<p>第二，所購之糧是否全數運到長沙交貨，如確係全數運到長沙交貨，其所需運費若干？</p>
<p>第三，當訂約購榖時，秋收已屆。糧價看跌，糧政當局曾否注意此項事實？</p>
<p>第四，中原公司及民國大學及湘供應局均非糧食商人，既未經過招標手續，又未奉糧部特別指定，何以獨吞各該處代購？」</p>
<p>憑天良說，省參議會這四點質疑，實在不是無理取鬧，有意非難；是天公地道，人人同具的懷疑。這四點中最重要的關鍵是「當定約購榖時，秋收已屆，糧價看跌……」身爲田糧處長，主持一省糧政，難道連這一點觀察力都沒有麼？明明再等十天半個月糧價就會大跌而特跌，田糧處偏偏爭取這麼十天半個月的時間，委托非糧商代購，每石達五千元以上的損失（九月初長沙糧價跌至八九千元一石，濱湖米價更低）。李廳長葫蘆裏賣的什麼藥？明眼人不用細敲就可推想一二了。</p>
<p>「五萬石軍糧」案引人注意是勿庸說了，但最最令人大惑不解者是胡邁貪污案正在審訊中，這位坐在胡邁交椅上的李廳長，公然敢幹出這等鬼鬼祟祟的勾當，這就不能不令人佩服他是吃了豹子的胆了。</p>
<p>天天槍斃土匪，天天有搶案發生。此輩人真的愍不畏法？生計所逼尚屬情有可宥！這旁在懲治貪污，那廂又在幹貪污勾當，如何說得過去？這件「五萬石軍糧」案，李廳長是否有不正當的意圖，各方均極矚目，也許不久可望水落石出吧。</p>

<p>— 五日長沙訊　本報特派員高元禮</p>
<p>炎熱已過，秋意來臨，樹葉由枯黃而飄落，社會上各種氣象亦正如此，如像幾椿著名的貪污檢舉，隨着幾次會議而相繼暴露出來，這真如秋葉一樣，隨風枯落，無所遁形。</p>
<p>李銳軍糧問題　掀起軒然大波</p>
<p>在長沙鬧得最厲害也最引起人們注意的還是糧案，省參議會曾爲此案召開過一次，留省參議員談話會請田糧處長李銳和供應局長周鶴汀出席說明經過情形，可是事情經過一個多月，還沒有具體辦法，大概將以不了了之。全案經過情形是這樣的：省田糧處於七月間秋收將屆時，爲補償部隊欠糧，以一萬三千五百元之法價委託中原公司，民國大學生產事業管理處及湖南供應局採購軍糧五萬石，中原公司和民大各承購一萬石，供應局承購三萬石，而事實上該時因秋收已屆，榖價大跌，長沙每石市價已不過六千八百元因此致公家無端遭受鉅大損失，參議員大譁，於召集留省參議員談話會時，曾對兼田糧處長李銳猛施抨擊，認爲該三機構並非糧商，利用地位，與民爭利，蓋中原公司負責人爲省參議員陳雲章氏，民大生產管理處爲中監委魯蕩平氏，且事前既未通過軍糧籌購委員會，亦未通知民意機關，又未經過投票手續，措置失當，應負行政上之責任。李銳氏於答復參議員質問時，曾屢述陳雲章氏等糾纏頗久，無法脫離，只得准其承購一萬石，云云。當時陳參議員雲章因事赴滬，故會議議席上未得聞其答覆，至魯蕩平氏則有私函致趙議長炎午，申述其辦理民國大學之困難情形，謂抗戰期間，遷移四次，損失重大，勝利以後，復員困難，故不得自力更生，以求微利，以補學校經費之不足，此次採購軍糧，絕非爲一已之私利，云云。（按民國大學生產事業管理處在長設有機器鋸木廠，米廠各一所，）最後全體決議應請省府責成經辦機關負責賠償損失，如承購人有非法利得之處，亦應追回。此事在省參議會方面由此告一段落，但長沙縣參議會開會時，又舊案重提，電請省參議會派員澈查，並請監察院將授受兩方依法予以懲戒，並分電各縣市參議會一致響應，則此案頗有擴大之可能。</p>

<p>全省代表大會　結果千篇一律</p>
<p>湖南省政府召集的長沙南嶽區二行政會議結束後，湖南省黨部第五屆全省代表大會又於長沙開會，會議的結果，可說是千篇一律，都是關於改進黨務政治經濟的提案，洋洋大觀。最引人注目的則是執監委員的選舉，參加競選的濟濟多士，包羅各界領袖人物，衡陽市商會理事長歐柄堃亦專程來長參加競選，全省商聯會和長沙市商會曾予以有力的支援，他們所持的理由，是以職業團體爲根據，認爲是商界應有人參加黨的工作，選舉前一天市商會在青年會招待大會全體代表及監選委員賴璉氏，席上曾得大多數代表的贊許，可是結果歐柄堃氏還是依舊落選。側面傳出的消息，說是歐氏的競選　動發太遲，這大約亦是原因之一。</p>
<p>清查團臨別語　憾無大方寶劍</p>
<p>正是五全大會開會前後，敵僞物資接收清查團由仇亦山先生率領到長沙來工作，長沙接收的物資本是敵多僞少，可是接收敵人物資的是軍方，當時的第四方面軍，早已離湘調走，只找到一個半路向四方面軍接收汽車的前戰時運輸局代表沈達可，據沈的報告說：他接收時所有的汽車已殘破不全，可是原始清冊又找不到，去電向前四方面軍司令官王耀武問，也問不出頭緒，可是事實上調查結果，證明沈確有些「毛病」，敵人原交來的汽車總數有五六十輛，至少有一半以上是好的，但據各配車機關的報告都沒接收到一輛完善能行駛的，確是怪事。清查團在長沙沒有多留，衹將沈案移到地方法院偵訊，地院已偵查數次，據傳牽涉百餘人之多，提起公訴日期還遠，關於其他清查案件，清查團無所發表，仇亦山先生臨時曾對人說，「可惜沒有上方寶劍」，言外之意，自然是有所顧忌。</p>
<p>撫卹金五千萬　令人啼笑皆非</p>
<p>湖南郵務管理局長黃理雙和撫恤委員會湘分處長劉思誠被彈劾一案在長沙，也曾轟動一時。撫恤委員會寄交湘分處的撫恤金五千萬元，湘分處竟數月不知有其事，而郵局收到，該項匯款，竟列入協款項下，雙方皆糊糊塗塗的過了幾月，行政效率竟如此，令人啼笑皆非，此案亦由地檢處偵訊中。</p>
<h3 id="c194">金瓜石礦區淘金記 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 三日台北航訊　本報特派員　江暮雲</p>
<p>到台灣來的公教人員，人們愛以「淘金」的話來祝頌他，這話多少含有商業性的諷刺性，實際上台灣這海島却是「黃金之國」。</p>
<p>地質學家和工業研究工作者說，本省的含金量相當多，具有產掘價值的鑛山，有北部的金瓜石及瑞芳等，其他像基隆的包金舖，花蓮港秀姑　溪流域，及鳳林瑞穗莊，台東新港等地。尤其是金瓜石鑛產金，銀，銅及硫化鐵等，礦區面積，達一千八百三十二萬五千五百九十四方尺，要是完成精煉的話，合計可年產黃金五百斤，等於八百條大條子。</p>
<p>記者於日前冒暑作壙區行，記者並不想去淘金，而企圖以一天的時間實地踏查一下。在台灣，人們也愛以金爲飾物，他們更有着「只要有金可得，即生命也置之度外」的俗諺，可是另一句俗諺又給這話否定了：「基隆海口有石帆船，任憑你掙多少金，都不得實惠的」，這却說明了淘金的鑛工，不是財富的所有者，管制淘金的機構才是金的所有者，海島的風土人情，正和國內一樣。而現在浮露在內地公教人員嘴邊的話却是：「基隆的水是鹹的，揚子江的水是甜的」，他們都想買棹歸計了。</p>
<p>（一）到鑛區去</p>
<p>到金瓜石鑛區去，只有一條高踞在三貂嶺之巔的公路，這條公路一離基隆市就進入了山叢，車身在山谷裏繞轉，這裏是煤鑛區，數十萬噸的二等煤堆積在坑口，若干更在雨中仍在冒火自燃着。從基隆到金瓜石的公共汽車，原先票價衹有幾角錢，現在却漲到三十元，這數目在本地人看來是驚人的。第一個大站就是瑞芳，這是到鑛區二分之一的路程，因爲它靠近全世界多雨聞名的暖暖地方，在基隆時天氣晴朗，在瑞芳却正下着傾盆大雨，天時地理，顯然與平野大不相同。記者在通過瑞芳到金瓜石一段路程裏，身體像蹲在震動得劇烈的飛機裏似的，頭有點兒眩，飄飄然的，俯首窗外，　　之頂都已不可拾，衹有一條行過的路在綠色的山坡頂上劃着一條羊腸似的曲綫，太平洋浩渺的面影，遠遠地分別不出地平綫和海波的分野。經過兩小時，我們在一個砌着水泥的山坡上停下了，車夫抹着汗珠很高興地說，到了終點。</p>
<p>（二）斜坡鳥瞰</p>
<p>順沿着水泥石階，走上山去，兩邊都是整齊的純日本式的木造平房，闋然無聲，領導記者觀光的說，以前這裏儘是日籍技工，春間都已遣散回國，因爲接替無人，兀是空着。我們在山頂的一個斜坡上作鳥瞰，看得清依山建築起伏不平的房舍，廟宇，小學和破壞了的精煉塲，沿着路都通有鐵製的水管，民家用的現在都改取竹竿順水的臨時措置。在這荒寂的山村僻野，暫作小息，心頭上却感到有點重壓。日本人的苦幹精神，被人驚嘆的正就在此，雖然他們是具有侵略和壓榨性的，而他們却願於這海濱荒村從事於工作，樂此不倦。</p>
<p>記者在小道上佝僂着背，向着山腰裏走去。一　　路籃褸的野性的工人，迎面走過來，他投向我們以奇異的目光，我們向他上下打量一下：一套破舊的衣衫上，滿是黃泥，面色蒼白，缺少了營養的皮膚，漫長的黑髭襯着黑色的眼珠，那面目是可憐的，但又帶有恐怖的。他唯一的工具是一枝鐵　，一把鎯頭，還有一盞電石燈。但他却露着親切的口吻對我們說，大約二十分鐘，可以到礦區，不過這裏全山都可以掘金，怕的不一定有。我們把頭向下面看，在黃沙堆的山峽裏，有三·五個人在張着大篩子，正用泥倒進去，篩過後又倒到地上。再朝前看，有兩個工人正坐在石上休息着，另一個正蹲在小溪邊，用順着黃沙的鐵勺和着水，再用小鐵錘磨着砂，一次二次無數次的，結果他低聲地向他的同伴說「沒有」。我們問他，這裏有多少工人時，他幾乎說出他的凄涼的現況：「沒有別的生意可做，只好上山來淘淘金看，但沒辦法，實在不能存有大希望。這裏政府來視察過了，何時開工，正不知道什麼時候。現在都是各做各的，但多數淘得的金子，不能養活自己」！</p>
<p>（三）坑門坍了</p>
<p>記者努力地向山頂爬，因爲路是碎石堆起的，年久失修，不易行走，好容易爬到了搭有兩三間屋的地方，那屋是用了荻蓋起來的，只有一面背風，有一間是賣着乾點和茶水，有一間給幾個工人斜躺着作「休息室」，還有一間裏却有好幾個工人在淘着砂金，三個男人伏在木棒上用兩脚在鐵　裏往返地研碎着砂子，經過這手續以後，砂子被順到一隻粗製的像大鴨舌似的木槽裏，熟練的工人用兩手迅捷地搗弄着木槽，當然這時已被加着水，將黃色的浮泥，一次次的丟掉，　着一層淡藍色或是灰色的沉澱物；將這些再加人工分析，選擇其含金量。這樣原始的手工的淘金法，使若干苦工，爲了生活不能不日以繼夜的工作着，同時也使掘金的自由地富者愈富，窮者更窮。這裏完全　如一塊未開拓的處女地，只要有資本，就可以小規模的在山上糾工淘掘，據說以前有數百個，現在却所剩無幾了！矗立在上頭的對面像剝蝕了青春年華的山峯，一個工人指着告訴我們說：這就是主峯，和這裏一樣，人們是沒辦法地在找尋着黃金之夢，他一會兒又側轉身對我們說：「你看啊，後面就是以前的坑門，日本人時代是隨時修理的，現在却坍倒了」！接着他很悲喪地說：「整個山頭被掘着數十個深坑，人們都害怕着，終有一天要演出坍壓的大悲劇的」！</p>
<p>（四）怎樣淘金</p>
<p>這裏原名是日本礦業株式會社金瓜石礦山，現在經資源委會台灣銅礦籌備處接收。據負責人語記者，該礦在前十年至十三年間是全盛時代，民廿五年最高生產量所得的半製品送日本佐賀關煉廠，計煉出銅二六〇三公斤，六九五四公噸；金礦在民卅年三月就停工，年可產二一五噸。去年三月銅礦也宣告停頓。該處目前正積極修復鑛洞及選礦設備，並採收鑛水沉澱。曾擬具計劃多種，終因資金缺乏，現在擬着手小規模的金鑛採選與沉澱鑛水銅生產。除現正整理修復採選設備外，將來新建熔煉廠及副產品硫酸廠等，須俟與加拿大Novanda　Copper　Company合作，經營談判成功，始能實現，現該公司正派專家來鑛考察。不過他坦率地對記者說：金銅鑛經日人數年開採，富鑛大部已掘去，現在的儲藏量僅足供我國消費數年之用。該礦規模宏大，鑛廠現有每日處理鑛量二千五百公噸的選鑛廠及青化廠設備，可是年久失修，非大規模修理一年左右，不能生產的。</p>
<p>該鑛裏外有九百個鑛工，他們有醫院，電影院，直接間接賴以生活的有數千人，較全盛期用工人數萬人時，不可比擬，所以失業問題的嚴重，迫使他們都自發的去掘挖砂金了！</p>
<p>你要來台灣「淘金」嗎？海島有的是金子，據說在花蓮港的生蕃區產藏更豐富，可是沒有人能使出膽量來。日本人在台灣掘了金是到日本母國去精製的，日本就從沒有把台灣作爲純工業化地帶，通過生產的方式而完全它的製品，所以要完成這高度的工業化，勢非撥出最大的資本和技術，但這，至少在短期內不可能的事。在鑛區逗留了一小時，從金瓜石走趕回來時，更堅強了記者的信心。</p>

<p>— 二日桂林航訊　本報記者梁小中</p>
<p>嚴箱季節的開始，偶然在涼夜的孤燈下，輕輕地讀一闋杜工部的「石壕吏」，沉重地唸一度「兵車行」，仿彿中世紀千萬雙痛苦的眼睛，又望着今人慘淡地笑幽怨地哭，十月開始，蘆花翻白，燕雁絕跡的時候，每一縣第一市的田糧處喜孜孜的開張大吉，征借征實附加稅準時而動，限期是十二月底一律辦清，在平時，納糧交稅在老百姓的眼中是一件比種田更平凡的工作，然而，可憐一片旱潦風虫的災害造成空前飢饉的大地，糧賦却像一枝利鏃插下人們帶着希望的眼睛，請聽廣西北部流行的兩句含滿眼淚底歌謠，他們低唱着「放下禾鐮沒粒榖，老百姓是唐僧肉」的詞句，這一羣瘦瘠的唐僧肉啊，甚麼地方才是他們的西天？去年今日，飢餓死亡的恐怖籠罩着整個廣西底時候，無依無靠的佃農爲了逃避死神的掙扎，橫起心頭去「賣榖青」，向地主和暴酷的放利者借到一點僅足活命的錢，譬如說，那時候借二萬元，最多能够買到二十多斤米，但是今年秋天却一定要還上三萬元到四萬元，而慘跌到二萬元一担的米價，簡直使受盤剝的人們哭不出眼淚來，二十多斤米要還兩担米啊，這究竟是甚麼世界！個個都懂得榖賤傷農，但是有誰更能了解「放下禾鐮沒粒榖」的慘痛？而況還有一年的糧賦，年底交不出會「有吏夜捉人」？去年田賦的豁免，全部的好處交給了地主，今年來，二五減租是廣西的施政中心，政府曾企圖把豁免田賦所得的利益從地主的手上攤一點給佃農，同時切實進行減租的工作，但是惡勢力的瀰漫和佃農的愚昧無知，減租的措施，遭遇了空前的厄困，佃農在高壓的迫害下面依舊站在死亡綫上重重的被吸榨血汗，究竟誰會正視這鮮血淋離的人生，這醜惡而又兇狠的現實！兩年來深藏的苦痛，在農民的心里是一塲夢………。</p>
<p>征兵正和征　一樣，是人民無上的義務，所以死亡四百餘萬的桂東西南北，自從兩個師管區設立以後，一次壯丁身家調查的結果，抽征的工作也慢慢地像一個波浪向四方開展。秋收過後荒　的年頭迫使農民忙着籌算冬耕，他們的心裏除了一把犂扒以外，又隱約地顯現着一桿步槍的影子，糢糊地想像着又一次不知名的戰爭。雖然目下還沒有正式公佈抽征的數額，但是從最近省保安司令部奉令抽調現役兵（保安團）三分之一赴漢受訓的情形和各師區借調第十軍官總隊隊員之多以觀，相信將來總應該是一個相當可觀的數目。八桂子弟掮起一桿槍，是一個勇武的鬥士，但願這一桿槍底槍口永遠向着天上。或者是民族的敵人。</p>
<p>多多少少的煩惱，把人們帶入一個無可奈何的世界，這裏我告訴親愛的讀者桂林三個失業的集團，再從這一個荒涼的角落看中國整個的現狀。也許不會是一件沒有意義的事情。首先是省級機關本月起實行裁員，三分之一的公務員眼前是一條沒有光明的道路，相信自己「有被裁把握」的人拚命地去攢門經，覓大路到頭來大抵是焦頭爛額，準備高唱歸去來，然而工心計懂令色的却又有一套把戲，××長在中秋節得到兩箱月餅破開來裏面都是黃澄澄的金子，恭聽之餘，我真担心這位老爺當時一時大意，連破也不破便把月餅囫圇的吞下去，弄到無疾而死，好一套官塲現形記！</p>
<p>今年廣西大學的畢業生正像家鄉遲收的禾稻，爲了一塲遷梧的風潮　誤了畢業的時間，吃了一塲大虧。搶飯碗的社會裏先一個月畢業的各大學底學士們早就佔了上風，等到廣西大學的畢業生到教部登記核用的時候已是「來遲三日馬家郎」左一封是國防部的「伺候派用」右一封是是台灣行政長官公署的「殊深歉疚，」弄到的確有點走頭無路，能够有把握找到職業的人不到十分之一，學工程的還多少有點去處，學政治經濟的便叫苦連天。舉行畢業禮的時候，省府派去的代表口口聲聲希望同學們服務桑梓，等到同學們真的要服務桑梓的時候，又是一個「甄別登記後候用」好苦的大學生！人材從那裏說起？</p>
<p>嬌貴的大學生苦悶，出賣勞力的黃包車夫也苦悶桂林的黃包車是木輪的，走在破碎的馬路上有如牛車，可是在維持人道的呼聲下，當局也決心限期把這三百多架牛車弄絕了跡，人力車夫紅了眼睛，大呼「把更不人道的事情取締了再弄我們」偶然和車夫談起這事，大抵都有一點「與破車共存亡」之概。本來在中國的社會裏，不人道的事情何止拉車一樣，福利事業沒有做，却先去吹仁義的牛皮，怎樣教人受得了？</p>
<p>勞工的問題牽蕩到桂東的門戶—梧州的時候，又有一塲並不爲小的風波，出賣勞力的有好也有壞，原來梧州海員工會內有一個起卸組的組織，是一片醜惡的黑幕。</p>
<p>八年來勒收過往舯隻的商貨行水，獲財無算，直到今年九月，愈來愈兇，居然隨意操縱了粵桂來往船只的貨運商人們忍無可忍，羣向省府請願，陳述起卸組的黑幕，結果起卸組奉省府令解散不料工人們受了異黨的煽動，居然強佔碼頭，變本加厲，至使粵桂航運一度斷絕，情況嚴重，直到近日，桂省府準備採取積極措施之後，才一窩風散去，這階段這醞釀着一次海員的大罷工，然而畢竟一切又靜靜的消散了。</p>
<p>連夜狂風的怒吼，把桂林推入了初冬的大門。百劫餘生的難民午夜的哭聲，夜夜可以聽到，冬令救濟的舉措還是一個謎，猜我已不願意猜的謎。</p>
<p>可怕的癮疾又裝飾這疾病的山城，一切都是那末貧乏，記者一塲幾乎送命的惡性癮疾，還幸運地有撲　母星注射劑可用而恢復了健康。而桂北有些縣份的醫院却只能够把一粒奎寗丸破成四塊分給四個病人，說起來又荒唐又辛酸。</p>
<p>前幾天黃主席從上海回來，除了慨嘆上海「燒餅比麵包貴，開水比電油貴，茶比咖啡貴」而外，還從別一個省，和廣西比較，表示出無限的安慰，黃主席承認廣西是寂寞的，然而建設的工作却還可以「想到甚麼便做甚麼」除了中央和地方可怕的隔閡，前面便是一條光明的大路。八桂的子弟不怕寂寞，廣西的人民需要的便是真正的安慰……。（十月二日寄）</p>
<h3 id="c196">地攤一顧 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 十一日重慶航訊　本報駐渝記者王伯祥</p>
<p>熙熙攘攘湊熱鬧</p>
<p>重慶填街塞巷之地攤，爲勝利以來應運而生之一種新興事業。自外表視之，重慶地攤固無以異於其他各地，但就其發展之過程而論，則地攤在重慶毋寧爲「得風氣之先」。抑此繁華富麗之陪都，在一年以來，其間經中央各部院會之還都，以及萬千客籍居民之復員東下，仍克保有其熙熙攘攘之現象，未至驟形冷落，則所謂地攤者，又功不在小。</p>
<p>重慶有舞塲，但以整個人口而論，每夜涉足舞塲之冤大頭，究居極少數目。有京川劇塲及電影院，但容納之人數終屬有限，且票價過昂，亦不盡合普通人民之經濟環境。於是逛地攤，乃成爲一般人之娛樂，且寖假而成一種習慣。逛地攤，不一定買東西，又能飽覽各色各樣之新舊物品，此實最經濟不過，而爲正式商店中所不容有之享受。有時與二三友人環立地攤之旁，雜論風馬牛不相及之晴雨燠寒，或談正經事務，擺地攤者樂得有人湊熱鬧，亦自歡迎之不暇。如此消磨時間，較之在茶館中枯坐聊天，自然又別是一般滋味。</p>
<p>地攤是勝利產物</p>
<p>記者曾經嘗試，將重慶地攤之發展過程分爲三個時期。在此三個時期以內，各有其經營特點，亦各有其貨色種類之不同。此三時期即：（一）原始期，（二）變型期，（三）白熱期。茲爲便利起見，特依次說明於后：</p>
<p>第一原始期，起於勝利消息傳抵陪都之頃，大約截至陽暦年底爲止，爲時約計四個月。先是，居留重慶之一般客籍人士，因震於勝利之突如其來，同時又因還鄉之心過於迫切，於是不問水陸交通有無困難，以及收復區日用必需品之價值或廉或貴，無不傾箱倒篋，舉凡不能隨身携帶之衣物，均一一陳之地攤以此較低廉之價格出售，以免一旦成行，棄之可惜。故此一時期之特點爲：（一）擺設地攤者十九爲外省人，且以老弱婦孺爲多，壯年人大抵不暇爲此，或因身爲公務人員，而子攸關；（二）討價特別客氣，有時還價便賣，首先予人以在地攤上買東西確較便宜之印象；（三）所售物品多係舊貨，但因平時愛惜之故，一經洗刷整理，亦復美觀適用，使人不厭其舊；（四）種類則鞋襪衣帽，書籍古玩，磁器碗碟，乃至一切日常用品，無不應有盡有，每一地攤或多或少，均能表現擺設者之家庭狀況，社會地位，以及經濟情形。</p>
<p>舊衣店員抓機會</p>
<p>第二變型期，瞬即隨之而來，在此時期以內，外省人士已不多見，其原因並非外省人業已走光，而係大家對還鄉之困難，業已體認清楚，一方面對於收復區之物價亦早有所聞，再則廢暦年關已近，縱使走得成，亦屬來年之事，結果理知勝過感情，日常需用之物，還是以不賣爲佳。但地攤貨物之便宜，既已樹立信用，一般人對之既有良好印象，於是本地人乃抓着機會代之而起。故此一時期之特點爲：（一）擺設地攤者，十九爲舊衣舖之青年店員，每日受店主之命，在街頭巷尾，以新的姿態爭取僱主；（二）討價漫無標準，有時且較其本來之價格爲貴，稍一不慎即上其當；（三）所售物品以舊貨爲主，難以未經用過之物如毛巾鬆緊帶之類，但舊衣如呢製大衣西裝或中山服則每一攤上不下數十套，使人一望而知其爲舊衣舖之物，而非出之住家人戶。此項投機取巧之地攤自無法維持久遠，至本年三四月間，因來路貨逐漸抵渝，遂歸天然淘汰矣。</p>
<p>走私貨登峯造極</p>
<p>迨至白熱期，地攤發展至此所謂業已登峯造極，在一二兩期以內其活動範圍尚僅限於冷街僻巷，至此則其勢力已遍及於各繁盛街道，而以都郵街及大樑子兩旁人行道與隙地爲最多。甚且登門向各百貨商店直接挑　，如賣化裝品之商店門外，即常發見售賣玻璃，髮梳，緊鬆帶，以及長統舞襪之攤販；文具商店門前常發現售賣各種自來水筆之攤販等。所有貨品，大都係走私而來，且不受稅捐拘束，開支又省，故售價較低。一般正當店舖，處此威脅之下，亦常採取兩種方式，以謀抵制，即在消極方面，以還鄉減價或出清存貨及各種紀念之花樣，來吸引顧客，在積極方面，則率性選擇店中部份貨物，命本店學徒在店外自設地攤，實行佔領空間。此兩種辦法中，尤以後者收效最大，使一般攤販暗中呌苦，啼笑不得，</p>
<p>「包袱客」大活躍</p>
<p>故此一時期之特點爲：（一）擺設地攤者大半屬「包袱客」，且特別以湖北人爲多，此外則爲各店舖學徒；（二）所售貨物幾全部係由滬港走私而來之美國貨，以文具化妝品及新奇什物爲多，舊貨業已完全絕跡；（三）所有攤販，均羣集於繁盛街道，背街僻巷，業已靜寂如常；（四）機動性業已登峯造極，巡邏警察甫一出現，可以立即將全部貨物裝於箱內，提置僻靜處所，暫避一時；（五）在此期內，舉凡稅收交通市容秩序，殆無不直接間接受其影響。</p>
<p>取締辦法已規定</p>
<p>由於上述第五點所生各項影響之關係，故近日市政當局業已採取必要措置，加以取締，但一般攤販以生活關係亦不甘示弱，立即發生橫的組織，成立地攤聯誼會，藉組織的力量來保障自身的利益。本月二日該會代表多人曾往市政請願，提出種種要求，請加以保障。當日市府第三三五次市政會議，對此亦即決定：「本市各項地攤，觸目皆是，不僅有損市容，妨礙交通，抑且影響稅收，此種地攤原屬復員時期還鄉人民出售舊物，由臨時性質逐漸變相，竟成爲販賣新出貨品塲所，自應規定時限，及暫准擺設地段，嚴加管理。經決定長安寺，打鐵街，及較塲口三處。爲暫准擺設地攤之所，至時間則以本年底爲限，逾期即一律取締。」</p>
<p>地攤西施生意好</p>
<p>物極必反，地攤自亦不能逃此公例。猶憶前此國泰大戲院附近樂露春餐館前面，有一地攤，擺設者爲一青年女性，大有文君當　意味，生意「硬是要得」，一般好奇者至錫以地攤西施之綽號，每當夕陽西下，電炬齊明，環攤而立者，大都醉翁之意不在酒，只爲飽餐秀色而來。西子去後，該處已大形冷漠，將來所有地攤全歸取締，重慶街頭正恐無復目前熱鬧也。</p>

<p>— 危言</p>
<p>這年頭誰也不大願意幹出版事業，真是無名無利。職工們鬧着加薪，說是資本家在剝削他們。出版物的銷路又不好。假使你顧及成本，提髙售價，讀者們又會說你摧殘文化。假使你不顧及成本，天下又沒有這樣做生意的原則。出版物的內容方面，太深奧，曲髙和寡，沒有人肯買；太迎合低級興趣的，人家又會罵你無聊，賣野人頭；欲求其深入淺出，以通俗文字寫髙深理論的，這樣的作家又不可多得。再加上許多政治上的隔閡和限制，好的作品不容易讓你出版發行，壞的東西礙着某些關係非呌你出版不可中。這樣的工作，誰願意幹？</p>
<p>前天報上載着一個很好的消息，說是朱經晨先生願意辭去教育部次長的地位來就任商務印書館的經理，國民教育司的顧司長也是辭去官職加入中華書局從事出版事業。我們覺得這是一個可喜的現象。出版界需要這種抱着犧牲精神的人們來苦幹。我們希望他們不衹是任勞任怨，而且還要保持教育家的態度來經營出版，要使中國的出版界放出燦爛的光芒，作爲復興中國的一個基石。我們要讓大家明瞭出版是一件很重要的工作，它的使命是推進文化。無論在何種環境之下它應向着這個目標前進。從事於這種工作是需要一批勇敢的戰士的。我們願意許多人來參加這個艱苦的工作。朱顧兩位給了我們一個很好的例子。</p>
<h3 id="c198">中國經濟原論 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 楊惠　王亞南著　開明書店代售</p>
<p>針對中國經濟現實的專論在今天真是稀世珍寶，王亞南教授的這本「中國經濟原論」，對於我們的經濟論壇，是一份最確切最合適的厚禮——送來一樣最需要最渴求的東西。</p>
<p>再巧沒有，王教授在序言裏所說的幾句話，正是我這兩年常常反覆向朋友和前輩講的那幾句。我在國立交通大學也是担任髙等經濟課程，教學經驗與所得的感慨，和王教授在中山大學可說是不約而同。連想起這些也許是其他各教授想說的話：</p>
<p>「……就我平日研究的心得，我相信講里嘉圖的經濟學說，比我講中國經濟史，還應有較大的把握，但同學對後者表示的興奮，却遠較前者爲大。我當時就感到，這原因，不當完全求之於里嘉圖那部大著的難讀難講，而更應追問到：中國一般研究經濟學的青年學子，在作爲一個中國的經濟學研究者的限內，他是否有理解這樣抽象的理論之必要，或者至少，他們所研究的抽象理論，是否能拿來同現實，特別是中國經濟現實發生認識上的關聯。由於這一種感想，我對於中國大學講壇上，關於經濟學以及一切有關經濟學課程所採取的教材與教法就感到大有革正之必要，我當時所寫明」</p>
<p>先讓我簡單的把這本「中國經濟原論」介紹一下，這不只是一本普通類似「經濟學原理」的著作，如作者自己所說，他的目的，迥然不同。「原理」的作家，應當爲「人人心內所有，人人筆下所無」一句成語爲圭臬，王教授在此之外，却還創造了出色的新論——這裏是他的幾句話：「本書是嘗試把中國經濟全體，當作被若干基本經濟法則所貫澈着的統一過程或統一運動。因而，各別經濟形態相互間的內在因果關聯，是我特別想努力分析的。本書的最後一篇或第八篇，雖是當作結論，當作一切基本法則作用最後必然歸結到的後果，但由於資料的不充分和我個人研究能力的限制，我十分坦白的承認這部書極其限，也許只能算是中國經濟之科學的系統的研究之發端。」後而幾句是作者謙虛的客氣話，因爲在這本書裏，我第一次看到這麼詳盡的中國現實經濟的解剖，近十年來國內經濟在戰時變動極繁，到現在，成了極不正常極混亂的局面；然而究竟中車經濟何以會演成戰時這種局面，（這是今天每個中國人心上的問題）王教授給了我們一個最完善最基本的理解和說明。</p>
<p>不能不提出來特別介紹的，是本書第三篇「中國貨幣形態」的這一部。誰都知道，中國當前一切經濟問題都是以貨幣爲中心，今年才去世的英國經濟學權威凱因斯爵士曾經喊過經濟理論永遠離不開貨幣理論，這兩樣東西其實是一樣，我要對每個關心目前中國經濟危機，喜歡研究中國當前一切問題的人說：你一定要看這本書。請讀王教授對我們當前貨幣上最現實最迫切問題的基本的分析，真是一針見血：</p>
<p>「我們不否認適當的貨幣政策，大有助於整個經濟的發展與繁榮，但根據我們前面的分析，貨幣的作用，是有先天的限制的，一個經濟發達的國家，它的貨幣乃至金融，是與產業發生聯繫，從而，可能利用健全的金融組織，利用適當的貨幣政策，對全般經濟發生莫大的促進與領導的作用。而在一個經濟落後的我們這樣的國家，我們的貨幣與金融，寗是與商業發生較密切的聯繫；結局，在商業資本活動極形猖獗的時候，要貨幣金融從中發生糾正的功用，那功用也就想得到是有限的了！……」</p>
<p>以下幾篇，中國資本形態，中國利息形態與利潤形態，中國工資形態，中國地租形態，中國經濟恐慌形態，就都是利用經濟原理來解剖中國經濟社會：其方法是把中國經濟的正體，分別從他各個構成的形態，加以極詳細的剖析和解釋，在把經濟恐慌看作是整個經濟運動之必然歸結的限內，作者在第八篇最後的結論裏，將以前那些個別的經濟構成形態，放在全體中來予以全面的考察。（註：原書第八篇第五節的題目是：從全般經濟法則聯同作用下體現出的恐慌基因及其後果。）</p>
<p>「我們的農業的，生產不足的，慢性的經常化的經濟恐慌，便是在上述這一列經濟運動——小商品生產，商業使生產物變爲商品，商業支配產業，商業利潤髙過產業利潤，利潤受規制於利息，各種不等價交換，資本向都市向外國集中，農村各種原始資本形態的相互作用爲資本在它們之間的流轉，勞動驅逐機具，甚至驅逐畜力——所聯同體現在的諸種法則作用下產生的。所以一旦世界恐慌在週期圏上走到了好轉或復興的上環，我們也就安然的覺得自己經濟也步入好境了。這種錯覺，被以次的皮相觀察所加强，那就是，認定租與稅的保持原狀或增加。其實，特別像在我們這種社會，租與稅的增加，不但與社會勞動生產力的减退，是可以相並存在的現象，甚且可以直接當作因果關係而必然同時呈現的現象。……」</p>
<p>這是恐慌的基因，而我們這一種慢性的經常的恐慌的後果，正如許多經濟學者在担憂着，照此趨勢下去，恐怕將日益沉重到不易支持。迷信於中國經濟恐慌只是承受世界經濟恐慌盪之震者，應該好醒了，因爲要從事於經濟改造，作有效的措施，第一部必須對國內的基本情形有健全的認識。</p>
<p>這書附錄，頗爲實貴的資料與理論，關於中國的商業資本，尤其抗戰以來的商業資本如何在找尋它的舊路與發展，（戰事發生後，以前由國際資本帶來的一切商業活動的新對象，新領域，既都相繼喪失，同時，國內有限的工業，又無法對商業提供何等重要的活動門徑，結果當然商業就又「舊調重彈」的把土地生產物作爲它最可能和最有利投機對象了），商業資本與工業資本的流通問題，都有獨到的見解，詳盡的申述。「政治經濟學在中國」，「中國經濟學界的奧大利學派經濟學」，可以糾正我們普通一般人對中國經濟認識的錯誤；以王教授自己多年的經驗和研究，確能呌我們看完這本書後，就完全達到要探求中國經濟運動的整體的目的。</p>
<p>看完「中國經濟原論」閉上卷，我謹以此書介紹給所有對中國現代經濟社會發生興趣的人。</p>
<h3 id="c199">「民眾教育」讀後記 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 朱載德</p>
<p>出版者：正中書局</p>
<p>編著者：俞慶棠</p>
<p>出版年月：三十四年三月</p>
<p>滬一版</p>
<p>八年抗戰，擊潰了侵略者的野心，得重步入復興民族之途，走上建國的里程碑，大家向着「教育建國」一個共同目標邁進，何等欣慰！值此當局努力推行全民教育——國民教育之際，我們不容忽視民眾教育。何况我國有百分之八十左右的文盲，此中至少有二萬萬失學青年及成人，都沒有受教育，所以應該兒童教育與民眾教育同時並進，雙方兼顧，雙管齊下，謀全民教育的共同發展與生長，才可配合建國的需要。</p>
<p>我們廣覽中國出版物中，比較精湛而充實的民眾教育藏物，仍形寥寥。筆者今介紹民眾教育專家俞慶棠先生最近由正中出版的一本民眾教育，可以值得每個從事國民教育者一讀。關於本書的內容，可簡要的作一介紹：</p>
<p>第一章爲緒論，首先說明教育與社會的關係，須認清「教育即生活」的至髙原則。要社會有進步，社會中的羣體——民眾，必得要有普徧受教育的機會。次說明民眾教育的意義及範圍。繼則說明如何作民眾教育的研究。</p>
<p>第二章爲民眾教育與成人學習，本意可以說是對成人能學習的一種「心理建設」。著者根據成人的生理，心理及各專家的許多實驗，指出成人學習能力不一定比兒童低或髙；但至少亦可認定成人優於兒童或兒童非一定優於成人的事實，傳統的見解，都以爲成人不能學習或成人學習能力不如兒童的謬論，可以不攻自破。同時又指出所謂成人學習能力的減退是因（一）健康的漸减；（二）學習興趣的淡薄；（三）學習機會的稀少；（四）怕人譏笑等原因。著者指示了我們要設法袪去這些不幸事件，庶可增加成人學習的效率。</p>
<p>第三章爲民眾與社會經濟，著者首先提醒我們，要認清「民眾教育之重心在民生，應從民生着眼，從民生入手，以達民權，民族之進展。」然後說明中國經濟背景，搜集各方資料，分析其因子：（一）耕地不足；（二）農村經濟的崩潰；（三）民族工業的衰落。並舉出許多實例，民眾教育對於經濟建設現有的貢獻，怎樣去達到最大願望。</p>
<p>第四章和第五章爲中國民眾教育之演進及外國成人教育的概要。這二章可以說是中外民眾教育史的論述，分別說明其特徵，使我們可以明瞭我國成人教育與外國成人教育不同之點，給我們在實施時有所參考和借鏡。</p>
<p>第六章爲民眾教育與教育制度的論述。著者指出了中國現行學制中，只有學校系統，而無教育系統；而學校系統中，但列學校教育，而不列民眾教育。而在教育制度中，民眾教育還被摒除於門牆之外，認爲有研討和改革的必要。次說明民教的行政諸問題，都有精當的意見發揮。再本章決大的要求是：（一）新教育系統的建立；（二）新社會的建設，國家民族，都需要廣大民眾的文化提髙，民族意識的覺醒，才可負起建設國家復興民族的工作。</p>
<p>第七章爲民眾學校，著者告訴我們怎樣來辦理一所完善的民眾學校？是最切合實際應用的資料。（一）怎樣分班；（二）怎樣支配課程和教材；（三）學級怎樣編制；（四）怎樣教學；（五）招生和留生的困難問題怎樣解決；（六）怎樣實施訓育；（七）民校教師怎樣求得學校的進展？</p>
<p>第八章爲民眾教育館，分別說明其組織·事業·及其實施中心機關（一）民眾教育實驗區，（二）民眾圖書館，（三）民眾體育塲，列舉應興辦之事業。更說明民眾教育館應與其他機關相聯絡，始可求得事業之開展；末了說明民教館服務員應有的修養，負起重大的責任。</p>
<p>第九章爲民眾教育實驗事業，本章說明今後民教的實驗事業，應根據地方實際需要，並且應應用科學原理及方法來實驗。關於鄉村自治·鄉村建設·政教合一等問題，皆有所討論。著者還介紹了國內有名的三大民教的研究和實驗機關的實際情形，分別說明其特點，可作爲我們今後實驗事業一種有力參考。</p>
<p>第十章爲民眾教育之目的與方法，是本書的結論。著者曾說：「民眾教育的目的，髙髙的在現實生活之上，遠遠的在人們面前。」又說：「欲蘇民困，首在保養與教育。保養之最終目的，在使人民能自保自養。欲合全國人民羣策羣力，共同保養，則必須人民咸具必要之知能，則非教育不爲功，尤非以全力從事成年民眾教育不可……尤須中央之領導，促其加緊努力，方足以完成革命之大業，而竟復興民族之全功！」最後又指示了不少實施民眾教育的重要原則與方法，確能給與我們不少的幫助和動力。</p>
<p>全書共分四大單元，分述十章三十八節，共九萬餘言，內容大概如以上的介紹。至於詳細內容，還有待於讀者自己去研究，自己去體驗。不道本書最大的缺點，乃是大部資料皆係戰前的。對於抗戰時的，未有論述，不免遺憾！尚希著者能在再版時有所增訂。</p>
<p>末了筆者讀完本書以後，啟示了我對於現階段民眾教育有下面的幾點迫切要求：</p>
<p>（一）「愚」與「貧」—目前中國廣大民眾，他們需要求智慾很切，希望解決「愚」的痛苦；但是爲了生計，爲了要解決生活問題，（即是「貧」的問題）有時不能使他們分閒去受教育，還要掙扎在飢餓綫上，因此分散了他們求智的心志。因爲讀了書，獲得了智識，不一定能解決他們的生活問題。在浦東的鄉村上流行着一句話：「不識字可以找到飯吃；不識人却找不到飯吃。」所以今後的民眾教育要先能解決這個問題，誠如著者在第三章內所提醒我們的一樣，應從民生着眼，從民生入手不可。即是要謀整個社會經濟的建設不可。</p>
<p>（二）「私」與「散」——從社會的各階層去觀察，我們可以發現社會上的個人，對每一種事件都是「私心太重」，處處表現着「貪」「虛僞」和「奢華」，只知個人的享受，個己一家的富貴享樂。再從社會的羣體去觀察，團體表現的是「散漫」，「無組織」，因此整個的社會籠罩了混亂的氣氛。所以今後的民眾教育，從個人要訓練其服務道德，先要有「大我」才有「小我」；從羣體應加强其團體組織，即是加强民眾的組訓問題。</p>
<p>（三）「病」與「弱」——在社會上每一個角落裏，遍地污穢，遍地垃圾；在每一個家庭裏雜亂無章，貧病交迫，形成了整個國家不健全，民力日弱，呈現着整個中國的頹唐無生氣！所以今後的民眾教育要能搶救中國民眾的「病」與「弱」，就應該加强衛生教育，充實衛生設備，積極推行國民體育不可。</p>
<h3 id="c200">幾部研究蘇聯的書 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>蘇聯是世界的謎。想懂得這個謎的，不衹是美國人。最近美國人寫了不少研究蘇聯的書，可供參考。</p>
<p>研究蘇聯，應從歷史入手George　Vernad。ky教授替耶魯大學研究院寫了一本A　History　of　Russia篇幅不多，却很扼要，他不專寫史實，而把蘇聯人民蘇聯的文化，宗教，哲理，以及社會政治上的發展經過，逐一分析，使吾們容易了解這看去似乎是很矛盾的一個民族。他並不政治理論。他在導言中說：「史家的任務，在於著史，而不必推論到政治或道德方面去。贊同或反對蘇聯的政治方式，都無不可，不過對於這組織的估價，却不可先有成見。」此書在第二次大戰後已增訂一次，The　Home　Library出版。</p>
<p>Soveit　Politics：At　Home　and　Abroad一書，Fredrick　I　Schuman等，Alfred　Ａ.　Knoff出版。作者曾寫過很多關於國際問題的書，以International　Politics　一書爲最著。作者曾至蘇聯和巴爾幹半島游歷，熟悉蘇聯情形。此書在蘇聯宣傳政策的幕後，去探討其政治與外交的真相。從幾位蘇聯領袖的言行中憲法條文及重要國際宣言中，找尋綫索，而尤注意於外交政策變遷的因果。在美國人看來，蘇聯的外交，確有點神秘而不可測度。作者提到斯拉夫民族能否與西方民主國家合作的問題，見解頗爲確當，文筆也很流利。</p>
<p>David　J.　Ｄallin在革命前，流亡於外，其後政見又與當局不合，可是他所寫的書，却持論公允，頗有史家風度。R　ussia　and　Postwar　Europe一書，從地理、人民、以及革命經過各方面，去尋求蘇聯外交政策的基本目的，原原本本，妙有依據。邱吉爾曾把蘇聯外交政策，當作一個悶葫蘆。這悶葫蘆是不容易打破的，須用理智去解釋他，才會明白。作者用冷靜的頭腦，來寫這書，頗有新見。Yale　Univerity　Prses出版。</p>
<p>The　McMillan　Company出版的Russia　and　the　Western　World一書。Max　M.　Laserson著。作者生於Lativia聖彼得堡大學畢業，執教多年，著述甚富。此書從另一觀點來說明蘇聯在這二十五年中對於其他各國，尤其是西方各國的態度。他以爲這是從政治社會各方面演化而來。與其領袖並無多大關係。戰事影響蘇聯不小，戰後蘇聯仍需與西方各國在文化上經濟上作相當的聯絡。作者很能心平氣和地來解答這不易解答的問題。</p>
<p>Soveit　Far　Eastern　Policy乃Institute　of　Pacific　Reiations業書之一，Harriet　L.　Moore等，敘述蘇聯對於遠東各國之關係，中日兩國尤詳。其材料大都在蘇聯國內搜集而來，國外少見。書末附有外交文件，甚便參閱。作者在最近十年中，頗留意於蘇聯國內所出版之日報期刊，精通俄文，常在蘇聯境內旅行，喜與俄人往來通訊，見聞極廣。</p>
<p>Henry　A.　Wallacc與Anorew　J.　Steiger合著Soveit　Asia　Missirn，Reynal　and　Hitchcock出版。蘇屬亞細亞，美國人知道得很少。此書乃作者們的旅行記錄。他們帶了專家，譯員，棄飛機至各地考察，注意其經濟發展，外交經過，尤側重於農業調查。在旅行時，他們曾和商人，廠工，教員，科學家談話，故非耳食之談。</p>
<p>同時又有W.　L.　White的Report　on　the　Russians一書，亦是實錄。當蘇聯准許美人自由旅行之時，他從裏海，一直跑到芬蘭前綫，又從西比利亞，深入烏克蘭的美國空軍基地。途中所遇俄人，上上下下，不知多少，到過農村，也曾到過工業區域；到過戰塲，也曾到過熱鬧市鎮，所聞所見，寫來不但很審慎，而且也很幽默，回味不盡。書由World　Publishing　Company出版。</p>
<p>專寫蘇聯實力的有George　B.　Cressey所著The　Basis　os　Soveit　Stength一書。蘇聯擁有全世界十分之一的人口，七分之一的版圖，人力物力，未可輕視。作者乃Syracuse大學的地理學專家，最近由蘇聯歸來，曾游西比利亞五次。全書論原料，論新農業，論氣候，論工業，論種族背景，論各地區特點，材料皆從實地調查得來，不由抄襲。文字生動，並不枯燥。Whittlesey　House出版。</p>
<p>Science　in　Soveit　Russia一書，The　Jaques　Cattell　Press出版，乃集各家報告而成。蘇聯年來對於科學研究，致力甚勤，善於利用無綫電，在遺傳學方面，研究也有所得，醫治傷兵，更爲盡心。美蘇兩國，在這方面，正在鈎心鬥角，互爭一日之短長。</p>
<p>Leon　Trotsky，史太林的政敵，曾寫史太林傳一書已譯成英文。書本未全，僅成三分之二，即遭暗殺。所幸筆記獨存，由Charles　Malamuse補纂成書，得以出版。</p>
<p>Trotsky本係幕中人，所敍親切有味。史太林之所以能獲得政權，其經過情形，紀載更詳，皆極難得之材料。</p>
<p>美國人熱心研究蘇聯，明爭暗鬥，自應知己知彼。</p>

<p>綺樓重夢</p>
<p>「綺樓重夢」，原名「紅樓續夢緣」，亦名「蜃樓情夢」，四十八回，有嘉慶乙丑重刋本，姚變「紅樓夢綱領」所著錄者爲瑞凝堂刊本。孫楷第「中國通俗小說書目」云：「淸王某撰。署「　　主人」，首嘉慶四年西泠萴園居士序。以第一回有「吾家鳳洲先生」之語，知作者爲王氏。書接高鶚書百二十個之後。」按孫氏考訂頗是按闌島居士所撰，除是書外，尙有「無稽　語」志異一種。今夏曾假諸周煦良先生，得讀一遍。此書頗多猥褻語，故同治間丁日昌查禁淫詞小說書目列入第十二種（「同治江蘇省例」）。書爲巾箱本，凡五卷，首有籣　居士甲寅自序，又面園漫士弁語，中有「家弟關　」語，後諸家題詞中又有王萴園之作，則作者爲王蘭　，萴園是其兄，書中常涉及之，亦即「綺樓重夢」撰序者。序言僅記干支，無紀元，據全書事跡考之，甲寅乃乾隆五十九年。其中涉及作者史跡頗多，茲按其先後分別刺取於後：</p>
<p>卷二詠春云：「丙戍中和節後，此部郎汪　園集各省名士於京城南陶然亭，作詠春之會。……王生蘭沚，武林人，年最少。……王走筆立就。」此條有自傳性質，蘭　疑爲其原名，籍貫亦由此可知。丙戍爲乾隆三十一年</p>
<p>卷三夢騐云。「庚子囗囗眷居都下，是秋獲雋」。庚子乃四十五年，中北榜舉人。</p>
<p>卷二虎師云：『余自幼聞其說，未以爲信、及宰壽寗其地寸土皆山，土瘠而民貧，余有詩云：薄俸僅餘五斗外，荒城僻在萬山中，蓋實錄也。』惜未載官福建壽寗之州代。</p>
<p>卷三夏德海云：『洛陽橋在泉州城外，……余調任赤嵌，自福州至厦門泛海而東，往返皆經橋上。』又卷四台陽妖烏自記任台彎赤嵌明府時，適逢林爽文之亂云：『乙已歲余調任赤嵌，秋九蒞任，……越明年丙午夏又有諸羅送斗六門　官之案。……明年丁未。……是役也起自丙午之十一月，至戊申三月而大兵凱旋，凡歷十有八月，余始終其事。』上述乃乾隆五十年至五十三年間之事。</p>
<p>卷三春燈謎云：「已酉余因公寓省垣』則爲五十四年事。</p>
<p>又同條云：『余客東甌，元夜出觀燈謎。」同卷夢騐云：「後十數年僑寓鹿城，…余故有「江山逆旅棲甌海，風雨寒燈夢皖城」。」卷五乩詩云：「辛亥歲余解組歸寓永嘉」。此皆五十六年事。至主十九年「無稽讕語」成，後五年爲嘉慶四年，「綺樓重夢」書成。——王氏生平之可考者，略如上述。</p>

<p>「外史」第三十回「愛少　訪友神樂觀」醜道士事，見明　復祚「花當閣叢談」卷七徐方伯條，文云：「徐子輿，名中行，好客，允好少年美麗者。一客醜甚，自負能詩，介蔡子木先生荐之與子輿。蔡作書盛言客自可喜狀，以家人將之，恐客之窺書而易求也。子輿得書大歡，亟延入，愕然笑吃吃不止。贈以詩曰：「自信金聲能擲地，誰知玉貌不如人。」客猶得意，傳示爲重。」（考證所引爲「堅瓠集」）</p>

<p>元明小說傳至後世，評註者紛起，如「西遊記」一書，有「西遊證道書」，「西遊原旨」，「西遊眞詮」等六種。唯「封神演義」僅有鐘伯敬評本及「封神詮解」二種，後者爲稿本，非流行之書。「詮解」，孫楷第「中國小說書目」卷五著錄云：『未見。淸　景撰。兪樾「春在堂雜文」六編補遺卷二「兪湖隱封神詮解序」誠：「仁和有俞君者，名景，自號湖隱，仿悟一子評西遊記之例，作封神詮解。其設想之奇，會意之巧，與悟一子異曲同工。」又云：「兪君與余同姓，同爲浙人，而余不之知。鄒儷笙先生得此書於蟫斷靈柩之中，而塗乙幾不可辨識，乃以數年之功董而理之，手自繕寫，遂成定本。其哲嗣景叔大令，余門下士也，出以視余。余讀一過而歸之景叔，俾珍藏焉。」』按「書目」所據以入錄者即本俞樾文，時尙未見原書。後杭州舉行浙江文獻展覽會，曾列「封神眞詮」稿本於會中，乃假諸海昌鄒適廬家藏者。「浙江文獻展覽專號」亦列目於其中，並有解題。按原書有俞景自序，撰於嘉慶二十年乙亥，謂書乃十五年館京師敎讀時所作。又有光緒十年鄒存淦（礎笙）序，謂咸豐六年丙辰得此書手稿本，經其刪補修訂而成。則此本巳非兪氏之舊可知。書計十卷，六册。鄒氏之書，原庋藏於杭州，戰後散於平滬，北平某氏曾得其若干種，然未知此「封神詮解」落於何人之手？</p>

<p>偶檢明「文淵閣書目」，於卷十中又得話本總集二種；</p>
<h3 id="c205">「烟粉靈怪」「新詞小說」　　惜「文淵閣書目」僅名，至卷帙，篇數，版本均未注明。「新詞小說」，當爲明人編撰無疑；「烟粉靈怪」或爲宋元人之作，亦未可知。錢曾「也是國書目」有「烟粉小說」四卷，宋元人作，此「烟粉靈怪」或與之同時，此類標目乃宋元人習用之語，明人殊少用此稱謂也。按前者所錄小說，屬「烟粉」，「靈督」兩類，故總括爲「烟粉靈怪」也。此二種孫楷第「中國通俗小說書目」失載。文學語錄  頑石　　文學是靑年的滋養品，老年的消遣品，得意時的點綴品，失意時的安慰者，家居時的良友，出門時的良伴。—西塞羅（Cicers）　　偉大的文學必須具有兩種要素：高尙的道德觀念和偉大的宗敎思想。—却寗（Channing）　　文學家的作品祗能表現文學家的一都份人格；文學家是比他們的作品更偉大。—包維（Bovee)少女（雕刻）  Bartholome關於樂藝上的譯音問題  朱理惺　　早在很久以前，我就打算把樂藝上有關「中文譯音」的問題，寫一篇「自我立場」的詮說了。可是我覺得這件事旣可能爲「吃力不討好」，復對於本身反會招惹許多「求全之毀」，這在稍具「理智」一些的說，委實是「大可不必」的。　　可是現在我們的時代，即將渡完了這二十世紀的五十年代了。溯自鴉片戰爭，門戶洞開以來，我們的文明雖然只有前進而未嘗後退，然而綜合一般的西洋藝術，僅就「品名」「題解」「人名」「地方」四種最平常的「譯音」或「譯意」上講，直到如今，也還是各行其道，而絕對的不統一的。國內從事文化工作的人，縱然一代一代的企盼敎育當局明令的歸劃，但是又有誰看見有這末一段公吿或新聞，所以有好多僑居中國而能寫讀中國文字的非中國籍人，常常就此在學術上橫生許多阻難。因爲今天是「胥勃」，明天又變了「修伯特」，後天却又變了「許潑德」；其實只是「Schubert」一個人，到了中國却不遜於「拔一根汗毛而變八十萬天兵天將的孫行者」。道眞是一種「奇蹟」。至於像「華盛頓」「柏林」「巴黎」的沒有這類「奇蹟」，那究竟是多數中的少數。不能因此就以爲「譯音」上是沒有問題的。　　有人說：「只要華感頓，柏林，巴黎，那些犖犖大者而日常和我們接觸的，沒有什麼變態，那就是了。其餘不是在接觸上必要的，或和我們日常生活不相關的，一人三「名」，也無甚關係。」這種「散沙論調」，當然亦不能斥之爲絕對無理。譬如歐洲的交響樂爲國人所理解的本是少數，那當然是置於「和我們日常生活不相關的」之列，更無須敎育常局通令「劃一譯音」的。可是即使以「少數中的少數」而論，道種一人三「名」的「孫行者」，也未免太有些「不便」！　　摩置（Wolfgang　Amadeus　Mozart）是日耳曼族的　國人，生於舉國的薩爾滋堡（Saltzburg），一生沒有到過英國。也不認得英國文字，可是死後一百五十餘年，如今在山國却變了（一）「莫差特」，（二）「莫才爾德」，（三）「摩若爾特」，（四）「莫查德」等等的完全照英文譯音的「孫行奢」了。老實說，一個國家的敎育當局，對於這些「區區小事」，旣然不聞不問，那末少數中少數的一份子，最低限度也得把這個人國籍弄弄淸楚，然後愼董的譯下了他的名字。不是我不客氣的說：歐洲的國家多得很，世界上的國家更多，英文並非拉丁文，除掉有人武斷的以英文爲一概外國文字的「首席代表」外，事實上偏偏「莫才爾特」是錯的，「莫差特」也是錯的，「麼若爾德」『莫查德』以及還沒有『發明」的，也都還是「錯的」；這個不是我的「定律」，但以「原字」，「國籍」，「方言」說，英國從來沒有什麼呌「莫差特」等等的作曲家，同時根本也沒有這樣一個人，有是有的，他在中國國語的譯音裏呌「摩渣」，果眞兩字底下再加一個「特」或「德」字，那許就不是這個人了。　　像這類不統一的譯音，我一時那裏寫得了那末多，一時糾正也不是一件容易的事。但依我個人意見講，第一，至少須恪守不把人變做「孫行者」的道德，而愼重譯音。第二，絕對依照原字「國籍」和「方言」的界限，使其在中國國語發音上不越軌，（但有時照着習慣，將「悲多汶」與「貝多芬」不分，然而這兩個名字，還都不違德文原音），第三，眞正在國語發昔上找不出這麼一個字的，襲沿慣見的初譯，保持原狀。我相信只要能恪遵這三點，大致就不會「誤人」。　　最近我寫過一篇：「新世界交響曲」，我把作曲者（“Antonin　Dvorak）譯做阿多尼·伏夏克，可說是準確而且得體，因爲我會親耳聽見過某大學研究音樂的大學生一致的呌「伏夏克」爲「德伏萊克」，誰知這：“D”字無音，正如“Mozart”的“T”字無音相同。外加，“R”應作“J”音唸，比“Mozart”尤多一個關節。這祇能怪伏夏克當初取名的「開玩笑」了。寫作態度與生活態度  胡膺東　　寫作態度等於生活態度，如果你不能够充實自己的生活，樹立一種嚴肅的生活態度的話，哪麼，你的寫作會在病態的生活方式與嬌揉造作之下，變得毫無光彩。　　語言的美，語言文字的光芒，也就是你的生活的光芒，現實生活替你培養一份，「光風霽月」的生活態度，這個生活態度，通過了你的寫作技巧，而後體現出你的作品的風格山來。賈克倫頓的名著：「馬丁伊登」，完全是從他個人的實生活裏提鍊出來的。馬丁伊登的生活史正是他的生活史的一部份，他的確已經獲得了他的個性發揚的秘訣了。因爲他是從水手，洗衣工人等實際的經驗裏打滾過來的，階級型的個性充分地洋溢在這部作品裏面；從這裏我們不難發掘出他底寫作態度與生活態度的一致性的聯繫。　　當然，所謂生活態度，並不是無根無根浮萍，它的根是從整個社會意識的反映上茁生出來的。換句話說，它代表着現實社會的一種最新進的意識：這個新的意識的提鍊，在某種角度上說，是揚棄了舊的糟粕，病態的渣滓，而放射出來的。在上海，有代表着「小市民意識」的作品，專門供結躺在沙發上的遺老遺少們作爲欣賞品的，這種作品裏充滿了的，是市僧氣味黃色趣味與龐雜陳腐拖着辮子的師爺氣味；這種作品談不上價值，它祗是「文稿市塲」里頂賣得起錢的商品而已。　　牢騷感，誇大狂，肺結核型的多愁善感，細胞衰老熱情衰退症，這都是寫作態度中的病態現象。它或多或少地流行在作者的血液裏，這種作品，會使讀者們同樣地受到傳染，它沒有給讀者好處，單單給讀者以消沉，抑鬱與苦悶。　　確立健全的生活態度是一椿煩難的工作，這不僅僅是作者佩人的修養問題，却是一個活生生的生活問題。如果詩人爲了寫詩而走進象牙塔去覓取烟士波利純，那正是一椿極其悲哀的事。　　過踏實的生活，感受得深刻，對現實生活理解得淸楚，所見的世面大，所觸到的天地廣闊，所遭遇到的人與事不平凡：在這多面的學習與體會之下，寫出來的作品才有靈魂，有生命。有血有肉的現實的題材，能够給大多數人以深刻的親切的感覺，它決不會使人感到單調枯澀與晦暗。　　持一份向善的心情，用身體四肢去感受，用頭腦去思索；生活是寫作的泥土。因此，如何去過活的生活，這正是問題的關鍵所在。　　如何過活的生活，這就導來了你對於生活所持的着法，也就是人生觀的問題。多少人費着口舌來談人生觀，多少人爲着人生問題而痛苦徬徨；但是，他們害上了一點毛病，他們都把自已孤立起來，把現實跟自己間隔開來：這種看法，正是第三者的看法。他們沒有年靑地抓住自己的生活，沒有用自己的目光逼視現實世界。　　擴大生活圈子，擴大視野，從個人到整個人類，從四週的環境伸展到　個字宙。這其間，我祇能用「擴大心胸」四個字來　括它。　　當哭泣的哭泣，當　頌的歌頌，當指　　的指摘，當歡樂的歡樂；一切的一切衹要是年靑的意　。最怕的是　故式的生活態度，跟老油條式的生活能度；這些，用不到古怪高深的神經來抽住我們的神經。因此我們所企求的是一其活的頭腦，「用活的頭腦，感受活的生活」，這　是我們的生活能度。生活是一首史詩，它雄偉，它也柔弱，它如金石鏗鏘，也如　泉瀉韻。紀德語錄  田楓　　那些畏忌影響　　影響的，不啻默認他們　魂的貧乏。偉火的思想家縱不畏忌影響，但却是飢渴　，去找尋影響。一寸山河一寸血　　65  葉勁風　　這雙橋站，在這條支路上，說大不大，說小不小。這時一停車，立刻就有些亂烘烘地，上車下本，呼張喚李，只我們這一團倒呌這般茶伕巡警兩頭軋住，沒人敢闖過來。　　「走」，那疤眼狗兇神惡煞似的，瞧着我同虎弟吼了一聲，還帶着想動手動脚的意思。　　「你憑什麼叫我們走」？我幾乎按捺不住了，「咱們是上通縣的，有話，你跟　們到通縣去說」。　　「管你上那裏」，疤眼狗伸出手來了，「你們犯了法，跟咱們上局子裏去」！　　這倒叫我有些爲難了：跟他們上局子吧，那局子當然是他一氣的狗黨，我們也說不出理來，不去罷，看樣子不行。况且這一去，知道要鬧出什麼事來，豈不白白躭誤功夫？俗話說「人急智生」，我這時雖「急」，偏生不出「智」來。正在急不出辦法的當口，不想虎弟突地從我身後，槍到前面，撲的一口唾沫，吐在那疤眼狗　上：　　「走」！虎弟喝着，「老爺撰的人，老爺跟你去，瞧你把老爺怎樣」。　　虎弟那口唾沫，正打在那傢伙印堂上，祗見他一雙手立刻握上去，口裏嚷着「噯喲」。　　「小姨」，虎弟又回顯對我說，「您不用下車，還是跟着車去。這裏我認識，我回顯就趕來」。說着又使了一個眼色，一回身，把　着的幾個傢伙一排開，朝車門走去。那吃了一口唾沫的傢伙，緊緊跟在後面。　　虎弟這麼一來，倒叫我更不得主意，不過這也是一種無辦法的辦法，—兩人分開，我可先上通縣去找救兵。—我想虎弟也許還有其他解決方法，也決不至吃他們的虧。祇是叫我一人到了通州，初次見人，還沒辦事，就要求救，面子放在那裏？我正在發楞，瞥見那個商人打扮的傢伙，一揮手，對那一羣狗黨嚷道，「不行，咱們又傷了人，非得叫這婆娘也下去，她可是證人哩」！　　他這一指揮，祗見另外那兩個巡警，悶聲不響，一個抓住我的手提箱，一個搶去虎弟的包裹，往車門直跑。我想「下去也好，不下去恐怕也難辦到」，便跟在兩個巡警後面，朝車下走，省得再生麻煩。車上那些鄉下人，都睜着狂眼，帶着一臉驚恐。　　剛一下車就看見虎弟還站在月合上，對火車頭瞧着，也許要等着瞧車開走？但一瞥眼又瞧見我下了車，便跑過來問，「怎麼您也下車？」我吿虎弟說，」不行，呌他們給擠住，大概不下來不行」。那吃唾沫的疤眼狗，也打驚失怪的趕了過來，生恐虎弟要迷走似的。瞧他唾沫已經抹去了，印堂上紅着一大塊。　　（記得前在寨子裏的時候，虎弟吿訴我，說他能拿唾沫打人，我說他造謠言。他說他試給我瞧；一撮唇喚過一條狗來，他也是那麼一口唾沫打在狗顯上。那狗好像給人打了一棒似的，回顯就跑，一路啤啤呌着。他說這是氣功，還祇使了三分力　。）　　「這裏可有咱們寨子的人？」我奉着虎的手，向車站外走，一面低聲問他。　　「不知道可有…可不要緊…眞上了局子，我倒有辦法。」　　「什麼辦法？」我牛信半疑。　　「單怕他們不上局子，通州城巡警方面，聽說咱們人很多；這裏離那邊也很近，不過十來里地，也許有一兩個？要不然，我得大攪動他一下，咱們那邊自然有人要來的…」虎弟很有把握似的。枯葉  楊謀　　人生有聚就有散，綠葉可也不是枯黃了嗎？　　一踏進社會，它就給我染上了濃厚的悲涼氣氛。歡樂的時候，我好像就已經窺見了暴風雨的先兆，一點凋落和寂寞，却就給我添上了無數的愁思。　　夏的街顯是燦爛的，生氣盎然地替每個人注進了生命的興奮劑。秋的景緻却帶給每個人是凋殘的傷悼。樹葉黃了，枯了，落了，隨着塵埃，在地上打滾，沒有誰能預料生命的歸宿，然而誰願意把生命這樣的枯零寂寞！　　我們檢視那些枯葉，我彷彿憶起了它們風姿颯爽的神態，我也彷彿溫習了一遍它們美麗的歷更，然而，痕跡也沒有一些留剩，它們的短促的生命却已經忽忽而去了。　　我要向它們吿別。當它們正在歡躍，人們都賞讀着它們，但是，它們萎縮了，人們也就丟棄了。世界上更是殘酷的事實，也不容講一些不平的。　　我祝福它們明年披上了新裝，重臨人間的時候，把人間的寒暖冷熱仔細的溫算一下。 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>

<p>自由談憇  少夫　　最便宜的娛樂，莫過於逛公園了，請問，二十元的門票，是不是等於不要錢。二十元祗能買到五分之一的油條，我曾親眼看見一張遺落在馬路上五十元的鈔票，走過好幾個行人，誰也不看一眼。　　上海各公園，各有各的情趣，以中區而論，外灘公園就充滿了動的美。路上車馬行人，江中艟艦舟帆，一闋交響樂章，是別的公園中所聽不到的聲響。　　坐在江邊長椅上，看那些未來往往的船隻，多少要回復一點我們的童心，情景不是和小孩子看湎盆要行動的兵艦玩具相彷彿嗎？水是啓發人的悠思的，最低限度可滌蕩心胸，在黃蒲江蘇州河入口的那一角落，你可以痴坐半天，爲眼前景色所迷醉，留戀不欲離去。　　即使掉轉頭看那些矗立在外灘的巨厦行列罷，金頂，圓頭，火柴盒子式，…雖是金融堡壘，操縱着無量數人的生活，建築物是够壯觀的，上海的天空，被它們支撑了。　　怱亂於寫字間，商塲，電梯，汽車舞塲酒樓中的人們呀，請花費半小時到公園裏去蹓躂一下罷！偶感雜談「面子問題」  S·S　　　　在中國無論什麼事情都要講究「面子」。兩家人家打起官司來，你如果要想設法替他們進行和解，那麼兩方面一定都要鄭重其事的說：「和解當然是好的，不過我的面子總是要撑足的，假使在這個上面多化幾個錢倒沒有關係」。於是街頭巷尾「打相打」至於眼靑鼻腫的，祇要一串爆竹劈列拍拉嚮上一陣，被打的這位仁兄便從破皮流血的創痛中露出驕傲的微笑，因爲他是有「面子」了。自己親生女兒或是嬌妻被人家通姦拐跑了，你一個人噤若寒蟬不算，還要叮囑別人不要洩漏機密，美其名曰「家醜不可外揚」，實在還不是因爲恐怕「面子」掃地，「合型」破產！　　因爲這樣，茶館酒店的生意便托庇興旺起來了。往往一件極平凡，而祗須三言兩語就可解決了的問題，一定要今天梅龍鎭，明日杏化樓，兩斤陳紹，數色豐看，酒酣耳熱之際，從國家大事開篇，放言政局，縱談女人，然後方始歸到正文；待主題一出，客人已燻然欲醉，朦朧中祗見主人款洽殷勸，卑躬屈膝，遂覺得滿面風光，週身舒暢；天大事情就在這麼半推半就一迎一送之間完全O·K·縱然先前曾因爲這件事受過點委屈，但是一頓盛宴，數杯小酌，遺憾的漏洞就被塡補上了。等到明天，玻璃板下又壓着許多「敬請關第光臨」的粉紅帖子，明知三日小宴，五日大宴，對時間有損，對胃腸有害，但一想到這是「面子」，面子怎能不要呢？於是乎嚥下幾粒「食母生」，又復欣然蒞止；酒樓中笙管嗷嘈，飯店裏人頭擠擠，「面子」遂得見閃爍在人流裏了！　　做官的對「面子」更是精研獨到，出色當行；陶靖節爲五斗米折腰而掛冠，恐怕多少是因爲那位巡按上司在他折腰時，把他「面子」劃破了；這是很久以前的事，究竟叫我們覺得彼此都太有點固執而近於笨拙。現在的人就聽明得多，上司們都憬悟到此風一長，將使人們都不屑於屈居僚屬臣守之職，那麼官塲就不像官塲了；所以折腰仍舊要折腰，只是「面子」給你維持到一個最高限度。這樣彼此就都可以感到相安和滿足。你看眼前何××不是已經有了「面子」在先，接着雲南高等法院院長魯師曾在被「交章劾奏」之下不是也就明令調任安東高院院長於後了嗎？雖然「與情不洽」，「面子」總還是要留點給他們的。零零碎碎  W·W　　敵產處理局公布一筆黃金接收脹：接收三千兩，其中二千七百餘兩抵付密報獎金，算盤一撥，淨收幾何？「重」賞之重字可吃重了！處之有理，要亦難得！　　據內行人談，銀行的生財在賬上僅不過是一個極小的數，五元也好，十元也好，橫豎是一筆賬有了就行。此與處理接收的黃金賬，頗覺相似。　　黃渡鄕師龔校長的座右銘：「不怕苦，便不苦，苦中得樂是眞樂，不怕難，便不難，難中求知是眞知；不怕荒，便不荒，荒中立業是眞業；不怕忙，便不忙，忙中體人是眞人」。　　足供一般苦守者莫大安慰！掌故雞尾酒會  本報資料室　　（編者按：本文係本報資料室答讀者之問者，頗有公開發表之需要，特此披露。）　　關於雞尾酒會德起源，有這樣的傳說：　　南美洲某市鎮內，有一家小酒店，店主名呌亞登，一應店務都由這個老店主和他的年輕貌美的女兒—瑪麗—親自主持。　　亞登有養鷄的嗜好，所蓄的鷄，種類繁多，總數不下數百尾。所以酒店內外，桌椅之下，常有它們的踪跡，它們撲跳啼呌的聲音和醉客的喧嘩呼笑鬧成一片，鷄羣之中，有一隻體重十五磅，紅冠鳳尾，非常高大的雄鷄，最得老亞登的　愛，特地替它取名「碩果」。　　一天黃昏，鷄羣歸巢，檢視之下，恰巧失去了「碩果」的踪跡，亞登在焦慮中度了一夜，以後，碩果一直不見歸來，老店主面上愁容也無時得釋。後來，他索性閉門停業，在門上貼了懸變尋雞的吿白：「本店失去大雄鷄一隻，如有拾得見還者，酬金三百磅，決不食言」。滿以爲重賞之下，必有勇夫，「碩果」必能安然歸來，不料過了五日，仍無訊息。老店主愛鷄心切，便在吿白底下，加上一行：「並願將小女塞爲妻室，決無反悔」。一時全鎭居民爲之閧動，人人都在妄想尋到「碩果」便可以取得瑪麗爲妻。　　第二天淸晨，紅日還未高升，酒店的大門，有人連聲敲擊着，店主開門，望見一個英俊少年，懷中抱着「碩果」，老人驚喜如在，少年述明來意，亞登樂極流淚，說道：「請你把雞放下，一切可以照辦」。　　第二天，就在店中掛燈結綵。賀客盈門，賓至如歸，瑪麗替客人敬酒，這一個要香檳，那一個喚葡萄，另一個又呼威士忌，她來不及一一應命，便將所有各種各樣的酒，混在大酒缸中，然後分給他們每人一杯。　　酒客嚐到這杯酒，覺得味道新鮮，紛紛詢問酒名，瑪麗無詞可答，情急之間，忽然見到「碩果」昻首振尾，五色斑斕，光華奪目，於是隨口回答：「鷄尾酒」。　　那一夭的宴會，遂由客人中的一個，發起定名爲「鷄尾酒會」。自此以後，遠近仿效，一直流傳至今日，成了招待貴賓的一種宴會。這一對是紐約動物園中的長頸鹿。羅斯福　如何應付　史達林（4）  法蘭絲·潘金著　葛春樑評　　許多忠實的老民主黨員，在那時候，感覺到他確以鼻子向下的對着他們。我記得老年的鐵姆·沙立文，鮑威區域的議員，他自己是一羣有趣人物的中心，和羅斯福有過一次競論之後，說：「一個非常傲慢的人，那個羅斯福。」　　但是在一九一二年八月，一個夏天休假期中，羅斯福是被一種小兒驚瘋病所侵襲了。他在極大的危險中，在離死亡僅祗一綫的時候，他逃了生。　　在長長的幾年疾病中，羅斯福遭受了靈魂上的大改變。我注意到常他回來時，他已有了一種勇往直前的性格，痛苦和災難，已驅散了他所有的傲慢。　　對於任何的不幸，他從來沒有顯露過一絲一毫的苦悶。在偶然的機緣上，他吿訴人家他有着特殊强烈的宗敎信仰。他深信那是上蒼的干涉，才將他從瘋癱，失望，和死亡中拯救出來的。他懂得信仰使靈魂有寄託的道理，懂得一個人微小的力量該和上帝的偉大力量聯合起來。（含有所謂盡人力聽天命之意。——譯者）　　羅斯福和英國人交際，那是應付裕如的。但是他應付俄國人比較困難，俄國人民使他感覺有趣。我記得德黑蘭會議之後，有一次我和他的談話，他回憶地說：「我希望我能够更深切一些瞭解俄國人，法蘭絲，你懂得我國人嗎？」　　我回答說：「不，很抱歉，我祗認識大使館中的幾個，以及在巴黎時，看見幾個開出租汽車的白俄難民而已。」　　「啊，」總統說，「我希望有人會吿訴我關於一些俄國人的事。我看不出一個好的俄國人和一個壞的俄國人，我能够分別一個好的法國人和一個壞的法國人。我可以分別一個好的意大利人和一個壞的意大利人；但是，我不能暸解俄國人。我不知道什麼東西竟使他們這樣的詭秘呀。試試看，你能不能替我回答什麼東西竟使他們這樣詭秘？」　　不幸，我沒有時間去深刻地研究一下俄國人，但是，我讀了一些關於俄國的書，並且常和幾個在俄國住居過的人談談，常常把我所知道的事傳給總統聽，在有一次偶然的機會上，我吿訴他，有一個人，他在俄國居住過很長久，是如何的回答我的問題「什麼東西使俄國人這樣的詭秘？」他說了這樣的一句話「那是欲完成上帝的意志的慾望呀！」　　我再間：說這話的人，有沒有把現代的俄國人誤認爲革命前，深信舊敎的俄國人呀？但是他堅決地說他們是有着同樣的性格。　　當我把這話吿訴總統的時候，他說，「你知道，那句話，或許是有些意思的。那可以解釋爲他們已將幾乎有些神秘的信仰，拓展到共產主義的社會中來了。他們好像的確肯做那些對社會有好處的事。我們是先把自己臉顧好了，然後，才出力謀社會的福利的。」　　在德黑蘭，羅斯副是以一種好奇與好感，來應付史達林的。（完）新聞人物新任行總署長　霍樹寶先生  裘囡　　政院善後救濟總署署長蔣廷　先生是辭職了，而由中國銀行總稽核霍樹寳先生繼任。霍原爲商界人物，今受新命恰如經濟部長王雲五先生之由商入仕。　　霍字亞民，爲廣東新會人，早歲曾受命於國民黨元老張靜江先生處。（霍初爲中央建設委員會秘書，而張爲主任委員）。張頗倚重之。民十九年張氏一度出主浙政，霍亦於是年底奉召前往，爲浙建廳主任秘書。　　廿一年秋，建廳廳長程振鈞奉派赴英考察，而派霍爲代理廳長，翌年春程歸，省府乃於建願巾分劃農村，漁收，礦冶各處；而派霍爲三處主任，其責權實亦不亞於應長，然霍長此三處主任時，雖極致力　劃，然卒因省府空虛，而與論　枝，三處成立僅三問月爲府　　。其時適中樞調張難先爲浙主席，張靜老還官京秩，霍乃又隨之還都，受任爲中央建設委員會設計處長。二年後，又調派赴美出國考察，三月後歸國，無何忽解職入中國銀行，任職總稽核，以至於今，將屆十年，未嘗更動。　　霍豐姿異俊，於浙時浙人曾以「美男子」呼之；然霍甚知自愛，擇偶謹愼，在浙之日，中饋尙虛，久久始賦好逮，其夫人何氏風韻秀逸，擅長音律，　言中英，德，蘇等國口語，又擅交際。「解放區」一主席　李一氓瑣事  學鷗　　報載共黨蘇　邊區政府主席李一氓，在淮陰安槃巷四號的公館，陳設精美，豪華異常，滿壁書畫，收藏古董尤夥。撤退時携走細軟十餘箱。其未携定的床兩張，一爲，烏木細籐所製，嵌大理石。一爲夏天所用，全床除木架外，俱爲玻璃，均極名貴云。　　這一位新聞人物，一般人知道他歷史的很少，但在二十年前共黨文化圈中，却頗爲有名。按李原名歐陽繼修，筆名華漢，爲留日出身，回國後即投身新文藝界中，與軍調部二十七小組共方代表李初　同爲後期創造社健將。（創造社爲我國著名新文藝團體，分前後兩期，前期中堅人物爲郭沫若郁達夫王獨淸等，提倡浪漫主義文學。後期即由李等主持，專門宣傳共黨主義，提倡所謂無產階級文學）曾主編小型半月刊「流沙，」鼓吹階級鬥爭甚烈，故不久即被禁止發行，創造社亦因此被封。　　當後期創造社盛時，在號稱神秘之　的北四川路上，忽然有人開設了一爿「上海咖啡」館，裏面還　着女招待，這在當時眞可謂開風氣之先，因此引得一羣提倡無產階級文學的革命文學家無不趨之若驚，李一氓和蔣光赤都是這咖啡館裏的常客，不時和女招待謔浪笑做，韻事流傳，有時情不自禁，往往形諸筆墨，因此不免有人議他們言不顧行，這和他現在的行徑，倒可說如出一轍。　　李原是文人出身，所以據他的鄰居說他暇時以詩書自娛，却也還不脫書生本色。不過最近曾作「九嬭山」一詞，對明末李闖歌頌備至，讚美流寇，逍却未免有些不足取法了。魚蝦龜競選　各有千秋  周文　　水族中，因爲地方不靖，乃試辦保甲。公推魚，暇，蟹，龜爲保長候選人。於是，牠們個別發表競選演說，內容　富精彩，美不勝收。茲擇其要者，簡錄於後。　　魚說：「查工作之效力，首推嘴吧，嘴吧可以吩咐一切，發表一切，支配一切，這是吃得開的條件。諸位請投我一票」。　　蝦說：「……查嘴巴不能代表一切，會稅不一定會做，在下身材玲瓏巧小，大處敢去，小處可入，前有鱉，頭有刀，這是實力的保證……諸位助我一臂！」　　蟹說：「……設幸福臨我而被選，我決不起用私人，一朝天子一朝臣的沿襲習慣我最痛恨。單憑我這麼許多手腳，已可單當一面。我不會說話，大鱉會替我說話。（牠舉起兩雙大鱉）事在行，行不通我橫行。諸位……請不要忘記我呌蟹」。　　龜說：「……竊思候選人首重資望，本人水中貴族出身，這見第一點。本人有兩樓之技倆，能爬，能泳。設陸上發生事件，舍我莫屬。這長第二點。本人手脚雖不敢自比蟹公，但，伸縮性却强。兄且值得驕傲的是我背，牠的堅强，在吾族中可說是首屈一指，得天獨厚，牠可以替我把任何臂架，擔負一切。這是第三點。假設，官腔打來，關係重大風緊事敗等事發生，我則頭」縮，尾巴在背臂上一掃，一切交給甲長。　　有此四點，餘毋庸議」。</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] Chairman Chiang on the 16th issued the following full text of a statement regarding the handling of the current situation: In my Double Tenth National Day Commemoration Broadcast, I stated that the government has always adhered to resolving domestic political issues through political means and will not abandon the principle of peaceful resolution due to any circumstances. I also explained that the cessation of military conflict has always been the consistent aim of our government. The Communist Party rejected the measures proposed by the government on October 2nd, as well as the ceasefire proposals of General Marshall and Dr. Stuart. However, the government will not abandon its policy of peaceful resolution and will continue mediation and negotiation methods to seek a solution. The current domestic political and military situation must not be allowed to continue to develop, further deepening the suffering of the people. However, what we face today is an armed political party that seeks to implement its policies through force. As the person responsible for the government, I must take necessary measures to ensure the peace of the nation and the safety of the people. In light of recent developments and the urgent desire for peace among the people nationwide, and further moved by the earnest expectations expressed by various parties and factions to end the conflict as soon as possible, I hereby reiterate the government's sincerity in seeking a peaceful resolution and propose the following concrete implementation measures: Once the Communist Party agrees, the government can issue a ceasefire order immediately; the informal five-person meeting centered on Dr. Stuart should be convened immediately to discuss the reorganization of the National Government, and the three-person group meeting chaired by General Marshall should also be convened simultaneously.</p>
<p>Communist Party Should Participate in the National Assembly When Ceasefire Order is Issued</p>
<p>These meetings will proceed under the following understandings:</p>
<p>(1) Restore transportation immediately in accordance with the restoration of transportation measures drafted by the three-person group in June of this year;</p>
<p>(2) Disputes within the Military Mediation Execution Group and the Execution Department in Beiping on which both sides cannot agree shall be handled in accordance with the methods drafted by the three-person group in June of this year;</p>
<p>(3) The stationing of Northeast troops as drafted in June of this year should be implemented on a scheduled basis;</p>
<p>(4) The National Army and the Communist Army in North China and Central China shall temporarily remain in their current locations, pending consultation and resolution by the three-person group regarding the allocation of stationing areas for the National Army and the Communist Army, as well as matters concerning the reorganization and consolidation of the army, and to achieve the goal of unifying the national army;</p>
<p>(5) The agreements reached by the five-person group should be submitted to the Political Consultative Conference's comprehensive group for their agreement;</p>
<p>(6) The issue of local political power within the cabinet shall be resolved by the reorganized National Government Committee;</p>
<p>(7) The Constitution Draft Review Committee should be convened immediately to discuss and determine the draft constitution, which shall be submitted by the government to the National Assembly as a basis for discussion;</p>
<p>(8) After the Communist Party agrees to the above points, a military ceasefire order will be issued immediately. Simultaneously with the issuance of the order, the Communist Party should announce its participation in the National Assembly and submit the list of its representatives.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Lei Zhen, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), took the night train to Shanghai on the 14th, stayed in Shanghai for fourteen hours, and arrived in Nanjing by night train on the morning of the 16th. After getting off the train, he visited PCC representative Wang Shijie. After leaving at 8:30 a.m., he took a letter from the China Democratic League's Zhang Junmai and others to Sun Ke, delivering it to Sun in person. He reported his trip to Shanghai to Wang, Sun, and others, stating that the various parties generally had no objection to President Sun's proposed new ideas but hoped that the government would first make a clear statement. The Chairman immediately pointed out that the government has always insisted on resolving domestic political issues through political means and will not abandon the policy of peaceful resolution under any circumstances. The cessation of military conflict has always been the consistent aim of the government, and the government can issue a public statement to clarify the government's tolerant and sincere determination to seek peace. However, various prerequisites for a ceasefire and political resolution must be discussed quickly. Representatives of the PCC present at the time, after hearing the Chairman's clear statement, decided to gather for lunch to discuss the matter. Wu Dingchang, Chen Bulei, Chen Lifu, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Shijie, Shao Lizi, Zhang Lisheng, Lei Zhen, and others gathered for lunch at the Lishi Society and discussed solutions. At 5:00 p.m., the Chairman summoned the representatives to his residence to discuss and meticulously study the maximum extent to which the government could make concessions. It was also decided to issue a public statement and dispatch PCC representatives from the government to Shanghai to urge representatives of various parties to return to Nanjing to hold meetings to resolve all issues. The government representatives to Shanghai were determined to be Wu Tiecheng and Shao Lizi, and Lei Zhen will also accompany them. The public statement was issued by Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department at 9:30 p.m.</p>

<p>President Sun's Interview with Reporters</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] After the government decided to issue a public statement, reporters specially visited PCC representative Sun Ke and requested a statement. Sun said that the government sincerely seeks peace and adopts opinions from all parties. (Note: The content of Zhang Junmai's letter to Sun was to hope that the government would make a statement regarding a ceasefire.) For issues that were previously disputed and unresolved, concessions have been made. Currently, all depends on when the representatives of the various parties return to Nanjing. If they can arrive quickly, various group meetings can be convened immediately, and various issues can be resolved in the meetings. The reporter then visited Zhang Lisheng, who stated that the government's issuance of a public statement is precisely an expression of the government's sincerity in seeking peace, but after the public statement is issued, all hopes are pinned on the return of the representatives of various parties to Nanjing. Wu Tiecheng, Shao Lizi, Lei Zhen, and others also hope that the issuance of the public statement can achieve good results.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Minister Peng's Speech <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] A press conference for foreign reporters was held at 3:30 p.m. today, hosted by Peng Xuepei, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, and Ye Gongchao, Director of the European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The following is an excerpt of Minister Peng's answers to various reporters' questions:</p>
<p>Q: How is the current political situation?</p>
<p>A: Recently, President Sun suggested simultaneously convening the informal five-person group, the three-person group, and the Constitution Draft Review Committee to resolve issues such as avoiding military conflict, reorganizing the army, reorganizing the National Government, and completing the revision of the constitution draft, as well as opening the PCC's comprehensive group to reach an agreement. As for avoiding military conflict, the three-person group must be opened to frank discussions. It is definitely not a one-sided, empty order that can be effective. We still hope that representatives of the Communist Party and other parties will come to Nanjing as soon as possible to continue discussions.</p>
<p>Q: Does the government plan to take military action against the Communist-occupied areas in the Northeast? Will it...</p>
<p>A: The gain or loss of some cities is not important. The entire national territory should be under the jurisdiction of the central government, and the central government has been invited to participate in the central government of the entire country, so the return of some cities to the central government is not a gain for the central government or a loss for the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Zhou Claims Not to Oppose a Ceasefire</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] The representatives of the Third Force remaining in Shanghai continued to make final efforts for peace yesterday. Around 2:40 p.m., Zhang Junmai, Hu Lin, and Li Huang visited Zhou Enlai for talks. Chen Jiakang of the Communist Party was also present. Laughter could be heard from the courtyard during the talks, indicating a harmonious atmosphere. Regarding the content of the talks, all those present followed Hu Lin's suggestion of "publishing as little as possible" and remained secretive. Zhang and others left around 4:00 p.m., and Zhou Enlai and Chen Jiakang both saw them to the door. Yesterday, there were rumors that Zhou had left Shanghai, which were not accurate. Hu Lin told the surrounding reporters: "There is no news to report, but because I did not participate in the talks before, I have learned about the past talks today." It can be seen that Zhang and others must have relayed the progress of the talks after Secretary-General Lei's arrival in Shanghai the day before to Zhou Enlai.</p>
<p>The Communist Party remains conservative and silent.</p>
<p>After returning to his residence, Zhang Junmai had discussions with Tang Yiming, Jiang Yuntian, Sun Baoyi, and other important figures from the Democratic Socialist Party around 5:00 p.m. Sun Baoyi told reporters that Zhang was waiting for a long-distance call from Secretary-General Lei from Nanjing, hoping to learn the government's views on the Third Force representatives' suggestions on a ceasefire and convening the PCC.</p>
<p>The Third Force had previously suggested designating Zhangjiakou and Baoding as buffer zones, but the majority of representatives urgently wanted to know the government's attitude towards the ceasefire order and the manner in which it would be issued.</p>
<p>After leaving Zhou Enlai's residence, Li Huang went to Difeng Road to meet with leaders of the China Youth Party. Around 7:00 p.m., they went to Zhang Junmai's residence together to discuss matters. Everyone expected the government's response to arrive, and the discussions were still ongoing at the time of submission.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] According to the Third Force representatives who visited Zhou Enlai yesterday afternoon, Zhou stated that he did not oppose a ceasefire or peace talks, but he was not confident about the prospects for peace talks. Therefore, the impression gained by the representatives was that Zhou's attitude had softened somewhat and that he might still be waiting for instructions from Yan'an.</p>

<h3 id="e13">Madame Chiang Kai-shek Discusses the Current Situation, The Most Pressing Issue Now Is Peace and Stability, Using Violence Will Make the Situation Worse <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 16th] Madame Chiang Kai-shek, who has rarely expressed her opinions on domestic affairs in recent months, recently told the Nanjing correspondent of the Indian Free Press that now is the time for patience and tolerance, allowing the other party to have the opportunity to show its sincerity for peaceful unification. China has suffered greatly from eight years of war and famine, and the people's livelihood is extremely difficult. Therefore, the most pressing issue now is to provide food to the people. This is not only a problem of food shortages after the war and enemy occupation, but also a problem of rational and effective transportation, which often depends on domestic peace. Without domestic peace, transportation cannot be smooth, and the economy will inevitably deteriorate. The Kuomintang, in the spirit of the Three Principles of the People, recognizes the need to end the one-party rule system and return power to the people as soon as possible so that they can have a government they like. The government made this attempt once after the Pan-Yang Incident in 1931, and then made efforts again in 1936 and 1937. This is the fourth time. The government's decision to convene the National Assembly on November 12 is to end one-party rule and return power to the people. Madame Chiang Kai-shek continued, people have freedom of thought, and it is inevitable that they will have different political opinions. However, it is another matter for a political party to use troops to resist the government. Bitter accusations will not help. We hope to reach an agreement and hope that the Communist Party can recognize that we should work together for the common welfare of the Chinese people. During the conversation, Madame Chiang Kai-shek expressed great concern about the political situation in India and expressed her trust in Nehru. When asked about India's unification, Madame Chiang Kai-shek said that the opinions of various political parties are inevitably different. Two heads cannot have the same thoughts. However, differences of opinion only in terms of thought or discussion are a healthy phenomenon, but the use of violence will make the situation worse and more dangerous. It is understood that "The Britannica Book of the Year" has invited President Chiang Kai-shek and his wife to write about the Chinese War of Resistance. The full text is about 6,000 words and will be completed soon.</p>

In addition, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, considering that Dongtai, Haian, Gaoyou, and other places have been occupied by the Communist army for a long time, resulting in severe disasters, has specially requested and obtained approval from the Subei Refugee Relief Conference to allocate 30 million yuan in relief funds to Gaoyou and an additional 10 million yuan to Dongtai and Haian for emergency relief.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 16th] The war in northern Jiangsu has been in a stalemate for the past week. The National Army advancing towards Xinghua from Baoying and Gaoyou has made slow progress due to entering lake and swamp areas, advancing only five li per day. Communist-occupied villages are fiercely resisting, resulting in heavy casualties among innocent civilians. Villages passed through were burned down by the Communist army in advance, a tragic sight to behold.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taixian, 16th] Many high-ranking generals have gathered in Haian, with four generals of the rank of mayor or higher stationed there. Commander Li Mo'an recently flew to inspect the area.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taixian, 16th] Thirteen bridges and culverts on the highway between Haian and Guijiaji were destroyed by the Communist army during their retreat. After emergency repairs, the road is now open to traffic.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 16th] According to a telephone call from Gaoyou, most of the returning home defense units in Gaoyou and Baoying counties have returned to their villages from the county towns. The local National Army and county government are assisting and guiding them. After order is restored in the villages, the returning home defense units will immediately be reorganized into self-defense forces to ensure local security, in accordance with orders from higher authorities. It is reported that after the returning home defense units on both the east and west banks of the canal in Gaoyou County returned to their villages, they were able to abide by government orders, protect the local area, and no incidents of revenge or retaliation occurred. In addition, in the villages ten to twenty li away from the cities of Gaoyou and Baoying, farmhouses have been emptied due to repeated looting by the Communist army and are in urgent need of relief. It is reported that the Communist army has stockpiled a large amount of public grain along the canal, which they have not been able to completely transport away. Local people are now hoping that the government will quickly find a way to investigate and prevent cunning individuals from concealing and selling it. It is said that the Jiangsu Provincial Government is aware of this and will send a senior official to supervise the handling of the matter.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 16th] It has been ten days since Baoying County City was recovered. Order in the urban area is gradually being restored, and shops are busy resuming business. Water and land transportation between Huaiyin and Baoying and between Gaoyou and Baoying has also been restored. It is reported that the Chenmin Bank will soon establish offices in various counties along the canal to regulate finance in the recovered areas.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 16th] After returning to Zhenjiang from Jiangsu, Chairman Wang Maogong of Jiangsu is currently instructing the counties in the recovered areas of northern Jiangsu to accelerate post-war reconstruction, with special attention to building grassroots administrative organizations, revitalizing local politics, and launching a political clean-up campaign. In addition, rumors that the Jiangsu Provincial Government will be reorganized are likely speculative.</p>

<h3 id="e31">British Foreign Office Also Denies Existence of Potsdam Secret Agreement; No Reason to Sign Secret Agreement After Yalta Conference <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] Following the US State Department, the British Foreign Office spokesman today solemnly denied the existence of a secret agreement attached to the Potsdam Agreement concerning China. Reliable sources believe that this rumor is a speculation caused by the subsequent publication of the Yalta Conference secret agreement. The Yalta secret agreement was a special situation, intended to respond to the environment created by the Soviet Union's decision to declare war on Japan. There was no reason to sign another secret agreement at the Potsdam Conference. Well-informed Chinese sources here also do not believe in the Potsdam secret agreement theory, but at the same time solemnly stated that if this is true, it will undoubtedly be strongly opposed by the Chinese government. Furthermore, diplomatic observers here pointed out: The content of the rumored secret agreement is also difficult to believe. For example, the secret agreement stipulates that Outer Mongolia should separate from China. In the Yalta secret agreement, it was stipulated that the status of Outer Mongolia should not be changed. At that time, Outer Mongolia was still under Chinese sovereignty. The independence of Outer Mongolia was the result of free Sino-Soviet negotiations and the conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of August 1945, which stipulated that the decision should be made by a referendum of Outer Mongolian citizens. Another example is the Potsdam secret agreement deciding to divide Korea. In fact, the future status of Korea was discussed by the three powers in Moscow in December 1945, and a communique was issued. The three powers agreed at the time to establish a provisional government for all of Korea, governed under the four-power trusteeship for five years. Although the United States and the Soviet Union have not yet been able to agree on the organization of the provisional government, it is also clear that there is no intention to divide it. Another example is the secret agreement suggesting that the Chinese government should accommodate the Communist Party, which also does not conform to the facts. Although General Marshall tried to mediate the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, a ceasefire was still impossible, let alone a coalition government. As for the claim that the United States and Britain agreed to allow the Soviet Union to act freely in China after the Soviet Union failed to organize a coalition government in China, it is even more absurd. Facts have proved that the United States and the Soviet Union have very different opinions on the Chinese situation. How can there be any agreement? Observers also believe that before deciding to act freely according to its own responsibility, the Soviet Union must first seek the opinions of Western countries.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 15th Special Dispatch] The Dutch government information office announced today: The Chinese government comfort mission led by Special Envoy Li Dijun will hold talks with the Dutch government and the Allied commander. The comfort mission does not have a political mission but only aims to improve the welfare of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies. In addition to traveling to major cities in Sumatra and Java, the mission will also visit the outer islands at the invitation of the Dutch government, possibly including Bangka, Belitung, Kundian, and Makassar, and will go to areas under the control of the Indonesian government in Java and Sumatra to offer condolences.</p>

<p>Hopes that the CNRRA Will Become a Social Organization</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] After arriving in Nanjing, Huo Baoshu, the new Director-General of the CNRRA, has been visiting the heads of various ministries and commissions in recent days. Minister Gu Zhenggang of the Ministry of Social Affairs also returned the visit to the agency on the afternoon of the 16th. Mr. Huo will stay in Nanjing for one more day and will return to Shanghai on the 18th. At 8:30 this morning, Mr. Huo summoned all the staff of the CNRRA here and gave instructions, saying: "Relief is like fighting a fire, and no delay is allowed. I hope that the CNRRA can become a social organization. I (Huo refers to himself) am the general manager of this social undertaking, and other agencies are shareholders of the CNRRA. Anyone who can help should continue to be asked to help, and even monks and nuns should be found to contribute to us." He also said: "I started as a small employee, and I can do everyone's job, but I can't handle the affairs of foreign experts." Mr. Huo believes that the agency's past work has its shortcomings and hopes to quickly promote the work to avoid being ridiculed by foreigners.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Ten Million People in Northeast China Lack Winter Clothing; CNRRA Branch Discusses Winter Relief <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 16th] Liu Guangpei, Director of the CNRRA Northeast Branch, told reporters: "The severe winter in the Northeast is approaching. It is estimated that 20 million people will lack complete winter clothing this winter, and 10 million people will have no winter clothing at all. Countless people will freeze to death. Secondly, there is the issue of the plague. Although it was discovered last winter, it was not allowed to spread. This winter, the disaster is worrisome. If unfortunately it becomes a disaster, the interior will also be affected." Last summer, the plague in the Northeast was not reported truthfully in many places. It is estimated afterwards that 50,000 people died, which is chilling. Director Liu also invited the chairmen and mayors of the provinces and cities in the Northeast on the 15th to discuss this year's winter relief and the joint middle school of the five provinces in Songbei. The joint middle school has been established in Changchun, and the school site is in the damaged imperial palace. Director Liu especially hired workers to repair the school building with flour. The funding is planned by the five provinces and cities. 7,000 packages of cotton clothing and blankets have been transported to the refugees in the five provinces to protect them from the cold.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 16th] Recently, many people who fled from the Northeast to the interior have been sent back. After a long separation from their homeland, they are all happy to return, but because they have no property, no jobs, and no homes to return to, or their homes are in the Communist-controlled areas, they have no homes to return to and are living in shelters. According to Liu Guangpei of the CNRRA Northeast Branch: "All parties have welcomed the return of the repatriated people, and the branch is also willing to do its best to help, but the severe winter is approaching and freezing and starvation are worrisome, so it seems that the repatriation should be postponed. There are many people waiting to be transported north in Shanhaiguan, and there are also many in shelters outside the pass. If they continue to pour in, it will become a serious problem. If it is until next spring, the problems of clothing, food, housing, and work will be smaller."</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 15th] Grain prices have soared in Changchun and Jilin. Sorghum is over 20 yuan per catty.

<p>Decides to Recommend Yin Shuxian and Others for Review</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Regarding the case of He Dequi's suspicion of being a traitor, the Resident Committee of the Political Consultative Council debated fiercely on the 11th. Finally, it was decided to recommend Yin Shuxian, Wu Zhaohong, and Zheng Kuiyi to first review the report of the National Defense Supreme Committee. Now Yin and others have completed the review and submitted the results to the Secretariat. It can be submitted for discussion at the next regular meeting. The review opinions are divided into three points: (1) The report of the National Defense Committee only forwarded the investigation report to the Ministry of Judicial Administration and did not make any decision on whether He Dequi was guilty; (2) All traitor cases should be handled by the judicial organs, and the National Defense Committee should not interfere; (3) The He case should be handed over to the court for handling according to law. The Ministry of Judicial Administration should not investigate beyond its authority, let alone conclude the case without any legal procedure.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Tianjin Dongya Woolen Company Actively Plans to Increase Production; Orders Raw Materials from the United States and Australia <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>[This City News] The Tianjin press visited the Dongya Woolen Company here on the 15th. The company is one of the largest woolen factories in the country. It owns eight combing machines, which even Japanese woolen factories cannot compare with. Unfortunately, due to the lack of raw materials, it is currently shut down and cannot be used. The factory's monthly yarn production was about 800,000 pounds before. At the moment, it only reached half of the pre-war production, and pre-war products were sold throughout the country and even as far as Southeast Asia. Now, the distribution radius is restricted to just Tianjin and nearby localities. When the reporter asked the person in charge whether it was possible to find a way to transport and sell the goods to coastal ports, they replied with a sigh, "At present, not only are transportation tools difficult to find and freight rates are high, but the losses during loading and unloading are even more serious. It would be fortunate if the goods that are transported out do not suffer theft of more than one-third. The Northeast is an ideal market. The factory has now placed large orders for raw materials in Australia and South America to prepare for increasing production. The hemp factory and chemical factory are two existing affiliated factories of the Dongya Company. The hemp factory has an annual output of 5 million hemp bags, and the current monthly output is 78,000 bags, which is 930,000 bags per year. The cost is more than 3,000 yuan, while orders from India are only 900 yuan. This is enough to expose the seriousness of the crisis. The work of the chemical factory includes six systems: medicine, pharmaceutical chemistry, biochemistry, microbiology, serum, vaccine, and applied chemistry. There are 14 kinds of products in total, and penicillin has recently been produced on a trial basis.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] Regarding the issue of relief for Xinjiang reclamation farmers and refugee children, the Central Standing Committee raised the discussion again today. The case was convened by the Secretariat and relevant agencies for consultation, and it was deemed that the situation of Xinjiang reclamation farmers and refugee children today is very pitiful. The government advocated resettlement in the past and must not ignore it. The weather is getting colder now, and soon it will be severe winter. Emergency relief should be provided. The Xinjiang Provincial Government should immediately determine resettlement measures. Two opinions were agreed upon: (1) A total of 2,500 Xinjiang reclamation farmers and refugee children will be issued complete sets of winter necessities, including inner and outer clothing, boots, hats, etc., and three months of food. The estimated cost is 200 million yuan in new currency. The funds will be allocated by the Executive Yuan to Chairman Zhang of the Xinjiang Provincial Government for overall management. The funds will be listed as emergency relief funds; (2) The Xinjiang Provincial Government should properly determine resettlement measures for the Xinjiang migrants and refugee children to ensure that all immigrants have a livelihood and are useful, and the central competent authorities should provide as much assistance as possible. This measure has been approved by the Central Standing Committee today.</p>

<p>Sentencing Soon</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] The Military Law Department of the Ministry of National Defense interrogated Yang Huimin on the 16th on suspicion of communicating with the enemy. Yang wore a red cheongsam, a short black velvet coat, yellow leather shoes, flesh-colored stockings, and no makeup on her face. She looked quite haggard. Since the interrogation at 9:00 AM lasting approximately three hours, she was still giving an impassioned account. When the judge asked her to rest for an hour and then continue, she said, "I want to speak, I want to speak!" At the same time, she kept making gestures, wanting the judge to thoroughly understand her. She also repeatedly patted her chest, recounting her past heroic deeds. Then, she wiped away tears with a handkerchief. When the judge asked her, "Where did you hear the news about the American planes transporting supplies to China?" She said, "I heard it from outside!" Then, when asked again, "When did you hear it?" She replied, "I don't remember clearly!" The judge then said to her, "Hong Kong has already fallen. Why didn't you go to Chongqing? You didn't receive an order from the government. What were you doing in Hong Kong?" Yang replied, "I was sent by the Relief Committee to work, and some people thought I was as passionate and brave as before. I didn't pay attention to these details." Finally, the judge said, "In court, you should answer one sentence after the judge asks you one sentence. You don't have to rush. Everything will be handled according to the law." Yang immediately exited the courtroom. It is heard that the case will be sentenced soon.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Heighten Vigilance Against Japan! <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The draft treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland have been passed by the 21-nation peace conference. As long as the four foreign ministers make the final decision, they can be signed and established. This is an initial success of the 21 nations' efforts toward peace; in the future, they will engage in even more arduous and heavy work to conclude peace treaties with Germany and Japan. According to U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, the four foreign ministers will begin discussing the German problem while attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York. After the UN General Assembly closes, they will return to Europe to conduct a comprehensive study of the German problem so that a peace treaty with Germany can be reached. Although the issue of the Japanese peace treaty will only be addressed after the German problem, it is estimated that the date of the opening of the Japanese peace conference is not far off. The U.S. State Department has already been studying and drafting the Japanese peace treaty. On the Japanese side, they are very keenly aware of the achievements of the Paris Peace Conference and believe that the date of the opening of the Japanese peace conference is imminent.</p>
<p>According to a Tokyo dispatch on the 12th from Agence France-Presse, Japanese political figures are secretly passing around a sensational secret document, the content of which explains the goals that Japan has for the Japanese peace conference and reveals certain guiding principles to serve as a reference for the Japanese delegation participating in the conference. At the same time, Japanese diplomatic figures are studying the previous Treaty of Versailles and the five draft treaties just passed by the Paris Peace Conference. They expressed their satisfaction with the fact that the Allied countries everywhere took Italy into consideration, and they believe that in the future, the Allied countries will give consideration to Japan's territorial and economic demands based on racial, historical, and economic reasons. Therefore, in recent months, the Japanese have been smiling again and dreaming beautiful dreams again, which makes us unable to avoid increasing our vigilance against Japan and shattering the beautiful dreams that the Japanese are making at any time.</p>
<p>First, the Japanese believe that Japan's position in the Far East is the same as Italy's position in Europe. This is completely a misperception on the part of the Japanese, and it can also be said to be wishful thinking on their part. Italy was an accomplice in World War II, merely following Nazi Germany in cheering and shouting; moreover, in the late stages of the war, the anti-fascist struggle of the Italian military and civilians made a great contribution to the Allied victory. Therefore, countries around the world believe that it is okay to be gentle and lenient when concluding a peace treaty with Italy. However, Japan was the main culprit of World War II. Not only did it first break the peace and engage in a war of aggression against China, but it also preemptively declared war on Britain and the United States. Even after Germany surrendered, Japan continued to resist stubbornly until it reached the end of its rope and surrendered unconditionally. Therefore, although the Allied countries do not want to adopt a policy of revenge against Japan, they must not be overly lenient and treat Japan the same as Italy.</p>
<p>Second, the Japanese firmly believe that war will inevitably break out between the United States and the Soviet Union in the future and believe that a war between the United States and the Soviet Union is Japan's only way out. Every time the Japanese hear news of the confrontation between the two major blocs of the United States and the Soviet Union, they naturally reveal a happy expression. Therefore, we must solemnly tell the Japanese government and people not to observe the international situation with colored glasses but to face reality. The Japanese have always been known to the world for their "narrow vision" and often have an unclear understanding of the international situation. Even in terms of the current world situation, it is impossible for the United States and the Soviet Union to have the same opinions everywhere due to differences in ideology and conflicts of interest; however, to say that war between the United States and the Soviet Union will ultimately be unavoidable seems to be a superficial view. At least today, both the United States and the Soviet Union need peace and cooperation. No country wants to see the recurrence of war. In Europe, although there is an invisible division between Eastern Europe and Western Europe, former British Prime Minister Churchill's advocacy of the United States of Europe has never been welcomed by the majority of European people. In the Far East, the United States and the Soviet Union may have different views on how to control Japan, but there is absolutely no situation of bloc confrontation. In particular, China wants to see the United States and the Soviet Union cooperate and does not want the United States and the Soviet Union to go their separate ways. Therefore, China will do its best to serve as a bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union, mediate between them, and promote mutual understanding and cooperation. Therefore, although there are often disagreements between the United States and the Soviet Union, they are still working together towards the goal of world peace.</p>
<p>Third, when Japanese people heard that our Foreign Minister Wang Shijie announced China's policy toward Japan in Paris, in essence: (1) Although China suffered major losses during the war, it will not make demands for reparations exceeding Japan's ability to pay; (2) When drafting the peace treaty with Japan, China will not adopt a policy of revenge; (3) China's policy toward Japan is generally the same as the United States' policy toward Japan; (4) Peacemaking should be based on justice. As a result, the Japanese have many erroneous illusions and believe that the demands that Japan will make in the future will be considered by the Allied countries, and they feel that Japan's future is very promising. In addition, the policy of General MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in the Pacific, to control Japan has recently changed from strict to moderate, which has further increased the optimistic factors for the Japanese. However, we must make it clear to the Japanese people that "leniency" is by no means "connivance," and "moderation" is by no means "appeasement." The reason why China does not adopt a policy of revenge against Japan and the reason why General MacArthur's control of Japan does not adopt strict measures are all for the sake of peace in the Far East, that is, for the sake of world peace, and not to allow Japan to secretly rearm and cultivate its aggressive forces. Japan's attempt to retain the Ryukyu Islands is even more of an absurd dream.</p>
<p>In a message issued on September 3, the anniversary of Japan's signing of the surrender, General MacArthur said: "Will Japan's future position in the world be a bastion of peace or a springboard for war?" This warning is worth contemplating by the world. Especially today, when Japan is immersed in dreams, even General MacArthur, who is responsible for controlling Japan, must be vigilant against Japan's conspiracies and prevent them at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e46">The Internal Conflict in India is Resolved! <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The Indian problem was caused by the fact that Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League, refused to join the interim government organized by Nehru, which led to many bloody incidents between the Indian and Muslim communities. The riots in Calcutta and Mumbai, with corpses lying in the streets and vultures pecking at them, were particularly tragic. According to recent news, Jinnah has met with British Governor-General of India Wavell and consulted with Congress leader Nehru before deciding to join the interim government. The list of five ministers allied with it was also announced by Governor Wavell the day before yesterday. This is a major success for Nehru in achieving Indian-Muslim cooperation through a spirit of tolerance. The relationship between China and India has always been friendly. We have always hoped that India can achieve internal unity as soon as possible and work together to achieve true independence in the near future.</p>
<p>In the past, the most important reason why the leaders of the Muslim League insisted on building an independent Muslim Pakistan was not the difference in religious customs. Many nations with different religions in the world can coexist in one country. China and the United States are clear examples. Although there are sometimes frictions between Indians and Muslims in India, they have also lived together for many years. Even in the six provinces with the largest number of Muslims today, there are more than 30 million Indians. Jinnah, who first announced the Pakistan plan in March 1940, also advocated Indian-Muslim cooperation during the last European war and translated it as only Indian-Muslim unity can make India truly independent.</p>
<p>The reason for the change in Jinnah's political views was still due to the overwhelming victory of the Congress Party in the provincial elections from 1936 to 1937. This made Jinnah feel that if Indians and Muslims cooperated, Indians would definitely use their majority to oppress the minority, and Muslims would not be able to have the power to protect their rights in the government. He thought that it would be better to be independent and free than to be united and oppressed. In terms of reason, Jinnah's Pakistan plan is not entirely unreasonable.</p>
<p>However, Jinnah's view is wrong. First, in terms of economics, Indians and Muslims must cooperate. Most of the places where Muslims live are very poor, and industry and commerce are not developed at all. Only by unimpeded communication with large cities and mutual assistance with the more Westernized India can the current economic oppression be resolved and the foundation for the future gradually built. Second, in terms of politics, India's large population, vast land, and abundant resources are bound to be coveted by ambitious countries. Although Britain has allowed India to be independent, it has not withdrawn its troops. How the relationship between Britain and India will evolve in the future still depends on the efforts of the Indians themselves. Under this dangerous international environment, the Indian and Muslim communities must not split up. Only a united front can resist foreign aggression and achieve true freedom. As for military affairs, Muslims have always occupied an important position. If India's national defense no longer relies on foreign countries in the future and is gradually built by itself, then the Muslim community can still make a great contribution to a truly independent India. However, this contribution can only be achieved through Indian-Muslim cooperation.</p>
<p>As for the issue of the majority and the minority, it is just a matter of political technique. For example, the regulations on the number of government cabinet members and the changes in election methods can enable Muslim leaders to fully represent the interests of 80 million Muslims in the new government, which is not an unsolvable problem. Congress leader Nehru does not discriminate against Muslims, and there are also four Muslims among the important representatives of the Congress Party. The seats in the interim government cabinet also indicate a willingness to give more. As long as Jinnah does not insist on the separation of India and Muslims, Muslims will not suffer any oppression in the political, economic, military, social, and other aspects in the future.</p>
<p>As for what Jinnah once implied to reporters on September 3 that Muslims might embrace the Soviet Union, we believed at the time that Jinnah was not sincere and was just making a political gesture to threaten Wavell and Nehru. As a Chinese proverb says, "Brothers fight at home, but they unite against external insults." The Indian and Muslim communities were originally brothers. For the past sixty years, they have been working together to resist British rule and want to build what Jinnah called a "free and united India." Today, for the sake of internal strife, they are recruiting another powerful country, creating new disputes and new controls. This is not a blessing for India, nor is it a blessing for the world.</p>
<p>Now that Jinnah has awakened and Nehru has also made concessions, the dispute between India and Muslims can be eliminated invisibly, and the future of India will show light. As long as it can be unified internally, the struggle for independence will eventually succeed. Therefore, we wish them success as soon as possible in building a new, independent, and free country. As for their breaking away from external forces, abandoning prejudices, and finally achieving the goal of unity, this good example is really worth referring to in today's China.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper Suzhou Electric, 16th] At around 8:00 PM on the 16th, traces of bandits were discovered outside Qimen in our county, seemingly attempting to attack the self-defense force. The third detachment of the local self-defense force discovered and engaged them. The bandits were unable to resist and fled in disarray. They were pursued to the vicinity of Outside Kuatang, where one bandit was killed, one was captured, and the rest fled in all directions.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Suzhou Electric, 16th] The notorious bandit Li Defu, who had been causing disturbances in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and his subordinates Luo Ying, Hou Mingqing, and three others, were executed by shooting outside the Changmen of Suzhou at 11:30 AM on the 16th. Bandit Li died after three shots, Bandit Luo died after five shots, and Bandit Hou died instantly after one shot. Thousands of onlookers applauded the execution of these heinous bandits. The details of the situation are recorded below: At around 9:00 AM, the county government received an order from Lieutenant General Chen Daqing, director of the Wuxi Command Post, instructing that the three bandits, including Li, be executed on the spot. Therefore, 50 armed policemen from the police brigade and all political police were dispatched, and Police Brigade Deputy Liu Ren was appointed as the supervising officer. At around 10:00 AM, County Chief Sui himself took the seat and approved the order to bring the three bandits, including Li, to the court. He informed them that they were being sentenced to death in accordance with the provisions of Article 2, paragraph 1, sections 1, 3, 6, and 9 of the "Measures for Punishing Serious Bandits in the Joint Defense Zone" applied to the "Regulations for Punishing Bandits." When asked if they had any last words, Bandit Li only said, "Having ended up like this, there is nothing to say." He requested to have his shackles removed and drink wine, but the request was not fulfilled due to the sudden time constraint. When they were being tied up, Bandit Luo looked around and said, "I will still be a good man in eighteen years," showing a complete bandit nature. They departed at 10:30 AM. During the journey, the three bandits looked around, appearing quite calm. After arriving at the execution ground, they knelt down facing south. After the supervising officer Liu Ren issued the execution order, they were shot and killed one after another.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper Bengbu News] Lieshan Coal Mine is a well-known mine in Central China. During the period when the enemy puppets occupied it, the mining area was severely damaged, and the equipment was completely destroyed. The So-Zhe-Wan Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs believes that it should be reorganized as soon as possible to continue production and sales to meet needs. Zhang Hu had previously been sent to take over, and mining engineer Chen Junhui was sent to the mine for exploration. According to the staff of the mine's takeover office, the So-Zhe-Wan Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is currently being closed in Shanghai. Commissioner Zhang Hu is delayed in Beijing due to illness and has not returned. In the future, the important work will be to reorganize the equity and reorganize the company. All important issues must be discussed and decided at the shareholders' meeting in Beijing on November 15 before they can be implemented. The Ministry believes that the mine has abundant reserves. Although it has been severely damaged, there are still two or three coal seams that can be reorganized. In the future, it plans to use new electric machines for mining. Mining engineers Chen Junhui and Cheng Ying will go to the mine again within days to conduct a detailed survey in order to start reorganization.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper Suzhou Electric, 16th] Personnel from the central and provincial-level institutions stationed in Suzhou believe that the current levying standard for income tax for public education personnel not only includes salary premiums but also extends to subsidies such as living allowances. At a time when prices are soaring and salaries have not been adjusted according to the price index, levying such a heavy tax is not reasonable. It has recently been heard that members of the Central Supervisory and Legislative Branches have jointly suggested to the Supreme National Defense Council that the original salary be used as the basis for taxation. It is still under review. In order to implement it as soon as possible, the Suzhou Central and Provincial-Level Institutions Employees Welfare Committee is used to contact colleagues in Shanghai, Wuxi, and other places to jointly petition the central government to approve the suggestion to show consideration. If necessary, representatives will be sent to petition.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Zhejiang Water Conservancy and Transportation Conference Opens; Various Districts Report on Urgent Projects; Shen Honglie Instructs on Making Drylands Independent of Rainfall <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Correspondent, 16th] The Zhejiang Provincial Water Conservancy and Transportation Conference was held this morning at the Provincial Government. Chairman Shen attended and presided over the meeting. Those present included Pi Zuoqiong, Director of the Department of Construction; Shen Yicheng, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs; Secretary-General Lei; Yang, Director of the Department of Transportation; Sun, Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau; Mao, Director of the Tanggong Bureau; Fang, Director of the Department of Social Affairs; and commissioners from the eleven administrative districts.</p>
<p>Seize the Agricultural Off-Season</p>
<p>Chairman Shen delivered the opening address, elaborating on the significance of the Water Conservancy and Transportation Conference, stating that it could solve the four major needs of the people: food, clothing, shelter, and transportation. All projects would be launched at the beginning of next month to seize the agricultural off-season in winter and implement them according to their urgency. Everything should be made concrete. Then, the commissioners from various districts reported separately, mostly emphasizing the importance of water conservancy and transportation and urgently seeking to eliminate disasters and seek blessings. The first district urgently needs to dredge Nanhu Lake. The second district's Xishan and Dongshan areas have been flooded three or four times and urgently need prevention measures. The third district's priority is to manage the Puyang River, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway line, and rebuild the wharf on the south bank of the Qiantang River. The fourth district's Jinhua River, the north and south branches of the Dongyang River, are like two rotten guts. Not only is it urgent to manage the river, but afforestation should also be carried out as soon as possible. The fifth district needs to build water gates in the Qujiang River basin. The sixth district needs to repair and dredge the Cao'e River and the water conservancy and transportation in the Ningbo-Shaoxing area. The mountainous areas and coastal regions of southern Zhejiang focus on farmland water conservancy.</p>
<p>Source of Funds</p>
<p>According to Director Pi of the Department of Construction's report, managing water conservancy and transportation is a current urgent task for Zhejiang Province and will not be suspended due to economic difficulties. Therefore, construction projects should establish close contact with administrative organs in their work. As for the source of funds, there are four: (1) Based on the approved plan, request the central government to allocate funds again. The central government still needs to allocate more than 4 billion yuan. (2) The province will allocate 300 million yuan for water conservancy and 250 million yuan for transportation. (3) The Gongzhen Committee will request the Zhejiang-Fujian branch of the Executive Yuan to allocate flour for work relief, 13,000 tons for water conservancy and 12,600 tons for transportation. (4) Launch national compulsory labor, without using people's money, but needing to utilize people's power. Before the Construction Department collects water conservancy project funds, it will first request a loan of 110 million yuan from the Agricultural Bank.</p>
<p>Compulsory Labor</p>
<p>Before the preparatory meeting in the afternoon, Chairman Shen made another statement, saying that all projects would be completed from November 1st to the end of next year, with the end of March next year as the main period. He hoped to use the agricultural off-season to launch more compulsory labor. In terms of water conservancy, large-scale projects should pay special attention to flood prevention, surveying, and planning. In addition to Ningbo, Shaoxing, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou, large-scale projects should be carried out in mountainous counties, expected to be completed in three years, so that drylands can be independent of rainfall. The specific plan has been formulated but needs to be studied. It is planned to start with Sanmen County, establish a reclamation area, and re-reclaim Lan. It is planned to send Gong Peicheng to conduct on-site investigations along the coast.</p>
<p>Principles of Road Construction</p>
<p>In terms of transportation, the national highway has been repaired by the engineering team sent by the Highway Administration. The reorganization of provincial highways should first repair (1) sections with existing road traces that are easy to repair, (2) coastal areas or those with economic value connected to national highways, and (3) mountainous border areas that can be used for security and bandit suppression. County access roads should focus on (1) connecting counties that can access provincial highways, and (2) developing local specialties with economic value, and pay attention to the widespread layout of rural telephone networks. As for personnel institutions, a water conservancy advisory council will be established in the province, composed of several counties based on rivers, and coordinated with the water conservancy engineering office. Each county will change the water conservancy committee to a water conservancy association, and each township and bao will establish a water conservancy cooperative. In terms of transportation, a transportation repair committee will be established in the province or administrative region, and each county will establish a transportation association. Then, the preparatory meeting will be held. Tomorrow, the water conservancy and transportation groups will review the proposals.</p>

<p>[Our Hefei Correspondent] Liu Ziyuan, a representative of Anhui Province to the National Assembly, was previously reported by the Anhui Provincial Election Office to the General Office of the National Assembly Election, which then forwarded it to the National Government to cancel his representative registration. Liu Ziyuan is a loyal person, and this matter greatly damaged his reputation. He repeatedly reported to the National Government to investigate and also wrote to the General Office of the National Assembly Election to apply for restoration. After several months of struggle, the National Government ordered a thorough investigation, which confirmed that he had been falsely accused and approved the restoration of his original National Assembly representative status. The National Government also issued Directive No. 768 of the Jingzi series to the General Office of the National Assembly to comply and notify.</p>

Large fishing boats are repairing fishing gear and will also be able to go to sea in a few days. However, the number of fishing boats has been destroyed by the enemy during the War of Resistance. There are only four to five hundred small fishing boats and only fifty to sixty large fishing boats.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Wuhu Investigation Achieves Results; Gu Zhutong Sends People to Accept Investigation; Military Men Embezzling Ships Cracked <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>[Our Wuhu Correspondent, 16th] After Ma Jingchang of the Wuhu Enemy and Puppet Material Reception and Investigation Team arrived in Wuhu, he is rushing to handle the following five cases separately: (1) The whereabouts of cloth, grain, and rapeseed received by the Fifth Reception Team of the Third War Area. Former Commander Gu Zhutong has repeatedly admitted that there was no other institution to receive them at that time, so he transferred them. He has now sent people to Wuhu to accept the investigation. (2) Zhang Weixia, the administrative commissioner of the Sixth District of Anhui, sold part of the received materials and obtained 90 million yuan, which was used for Wuhu municipal construction. Zhang has ordered the local authorities to raise funds to compensate and has already returned 40 million yuan. (3) The Anhui Provincial Government's letter to the Enterprise Company stated that part of the received materials were sold and transferred to the Sea Workers' Union. Ma has written to the Anhui Provincial Government to explain the reasons. (4) The original inventory of materials received by Li Zhicheng, the former magistrate of Wuhu County, did not match the materials handed over to the successor. Moreover, he was sentenced to life imprisonment for extorting merchants and is in custody. The mismatched part of the reception has been handed over to the court for handling. (5) The Housing Property Dispute Committee organized by local gentry used materials. Ma is investigating detailed accounts and uses. (6) When the Wuhu County Bank received the pseudo-Yuwan Bank, there were rumors of gold in the market. Ma interrogated Zhu Jinhou, the manager of the pseudo-bank who was in custody, but Zhu denied it.</p>
<p>[Our Wuhu Correspondent, 16th] (1) The first case of embezzlement of materials cracked by the investigation team in Wuhu was the Zhihao small transport ship. After the ship was received by soldier Zhang Tao, it sailed between Wuhu and Wuwei for profit. Almost no one knew its original name. After Ma received a secret report upon arriving in Wuhu, he sent personnel to Wuwei County for secret investigation. The ship was indeed in Wuwei, guarded by several soldiers, and had been hidden in the reeds ten miles away from the city river. After discussing with the county government, the ship was transferred to the county town and then escorted to Wuhu on the 15th evening. (2) Yumin Rice Mill's rice milling machine. A secret report stated that this machine was received from the enemy and puppets by soldiers. Ma has gone to investigate and summoned Ma Zhonghe, the manager of the factory, for questioning (on the 16th).</p>

<p>Factory Site Located Outside Wujin East Gate</p>
<p>[Our Wujin Correspondent] The rumor that Rong Desheng would establish a Shenxin yarn factory in Wujin has been circulating for a long time. It is now known that Rong has decided to establish the Shenxin No. 10 yarn factory in Wujin, with 50,000 spindles planned. The yarn spun will be exclusively for local weaving. Dingdongshou outside the East Gate has been selected, and more than 100 mu of land have been purchased as the factory site. Zhang Boxi and Xu Zuyuan have been hired as land purchase directors, and Zhang Bohong and Bi Youquan are the local sales representatives. 96% of the land purchase work has been completed. Only a few landlords are still arguing and hoping for a high price estimate. It is agreed that after the late rice is harvested, engineers will be sent to survey and implement the construction.</p>

<p>[Our Taixian Correspondent] The weather has been turning cooler recently. The local relief authorities, mindful of the suffering of displaced refugees, have received 10,000 pieces of winter clothing from higher authorities and have begun to distribute them. As the quantity is too small, they are currently soliciting donations widely. In addition, when the enemy troops stationed in this county surrendered, they left a batch of biscuits, which the county government has temporarily preserved. The county government believes that they will inevitably spoil if stored for a long time, so they are distributing them to the refugees to fill their hunger.</p>

<p>[Our Pinghu Correspondent] The reorganization of the county's Self-Defense Corps into the police corps has been underway for two months since receiving the order. Because the authorities have considered it thoroughly and have made every effort to address the issue of the discharged personnel's livelihood, it was officially announced only on the 12th. The urban area, Zhapu, and Xincang groups are handling the counting, compiling, and distribution of severance pay separately. The county has a population of 260,000. According to the regulation of one policeman per thousand people, there should be 260 policemen. In addition to 150 administrative police, only 110 of the more than 300 Self-Defense Corps members can be retained.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The county's Land and Grain Office, with the start of the collection of actual grain as ordered, urgently needs to collect and store the prepaid taxes. The planned construction of warehouses has already been put out to tender on the 9th of this month, and Song Liji has won the bid. Construction must begin immediately. The construction funds have been approved to be extracted from one-tenth of the 20,000 shi of prepaid grain. Yesterday, it was specially submitted to the Provincial Audit Office, requesting them to send personnel to Ping to facilitate the payment of construction costs at any time.</p>

<p>[Our Jiangyin Correspondent] In the Hudaqiao area of the Fourth District, cricket fighting was held, and public gambling was openly conducted. On the 12th, the Zhouzhuang Police Station sent Inspector Xu Jianxun to lead nine policemen to investigate. More than 20 gamblers were arrested on the spot, and more than 500,000 in gambling tools and cash were seized. Just as the witnesses were being taken away, Gong Tianming, a local figure, gathered more than 100 people to rob the gamblers and exhibits and beat and injured policemen Chen Zhengcong, Fang Yutian, and He Jinhong. The other six policemen, including Wang Fuying, suffered minor injuries. All long and short guns were also snatched away, several were damaged, and the policemen's hats and clothing were torn off. After the truth was investigated by Guo Lingwang, the district chief of Huashu, and He Mengping, the chief of the Zhouzhuang Police Station, they reported to the Police Bureau Chief Fang and the County Magistrate to request instructions on how to handle the matter.</p>

<p>[Our Changsha Correspondent] On the eve of the Double Tenth Festival, all sectors of Hunan Province launched a large-scale Cleanliness and Order Movement Week. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the third day, Wang Zuoji, a chief of staff of a certain military department stationed in Changsha, and Peng, the director of the military department, watched a play at the Le Yuan Theater. Their attire was not neat, and they were smoking cigarettes (according to the New Life Movement regulations, smoking is prohibited in public places). Zhang Ruoye, a member of the New Life Movement Discipline Squad, which was jointly organized by the military police and constabulary and was enforcing order on the spot, asked them to follow the creeds of New Life Movement and not to smoke. Unexpectedly, Wang and others believed that the soldier dared to interfere with their behavior, which damaged their dignity. They beat Zhang Ruoye severely and angrily cursed, "What New Life Movement," and shouted for the adjutant to arrest people. The audience on the spot expressed public indignation and criticized them. The leader of the New Life Movement Discipline Squad, because Wang and others were violent and unreasonable, fearing that they would disrupt order and the safety of the audience, had to tolerate it, appeasing the beaten Zhang Ruoye and asking Wang and others to calm down, and persuading the audience to calm down, fortunately not escalating. Unexpectedly, in the middle of the play, Wang and others retreated to the back of the seat and brutally insulted Shu Wenbo, the leader of the military contingent of the Discipline Squad, and then left in satisfaction.</p>

<p>New Students Heading North Face Problems</p>
<p>I am one of the new students admitted to Beiyang University this time. During the oral examination on the 8th, the examiner said that it is very difficult to gather and go north this time in terms of ship tickets, and it is best to find a way to handle it yourself. Therefore, in order to go north within the time limit, I have been running around for several days, inquiring about the shipping schedule and ship tickets to the north. Most of the replies are that there are none, which makes me very anxious. The school requires reporting to Tianjin by the 25th. According to this situation, I am afraid that even if I wait for a few more months, I will not be able to buy a ticket! If you buy on the black market, the ticket price is extremely high, and whether you can buy it is still a question. In fact, the school may not be able to buy it for you, let alone the students. According to this situation, if all the students going north encounter such difficulties, then most of them will not be able to go north. At the same time, there is still one question. Most of the new students admitted in the Shanghai area this time, I believe, have not been to the wharf, let alone Tianjin. Therefore, there will inevitably be many difficulties in the required clothing, travel expenses, and how to travel to Tianjin. In this situation, I hope that the authorities of Beiyang University can order the students to gather and travel together (because the previous batches of Beiyang University students going north also went together). On the one hand, students who are going out for the first time can take care of each other, on the other hand, they can avoid the pain of buying black market tickets, and at the same time, the students will not be late to report. We know that it is very difficult for the school to gather and go north, but it is much more convenient for the students. (Yishao)</p>
<p>Municipal Ferry Company Should Repair Roads</p>
<p>The Dongjiadu Wharf in Nanshi is an important transportation hub for people from the four counties of Pudong, Shangnan, Chuan, and Feng to go to Shanghai. Since the 1st of this month, it has been changed to the municipal ferry, which is very convenient. However, the road surface from the wharf to the Limmalu section is rugged and uneven, and the sunken area is very deep. Electrical wires and iron wires are scattered all over the ground. When it rains, the water accumulates to a foot deep and does not dry for several days, making it muddy and difficult to walk. People slip and fall, and their heads and knees are broken every day. In addition, farmers and village women from the four townships and eight towns of Pudong and farmers from the suburbs of Tangqiao Town go to Shanghai to sell vegetables as a side business. They take this municipal ferry at three or four o'clock at night and carry heavy loads on their shoulders, making it extremely difficult to pass this rugged road. I am erroneously honored as a consultant to the township office, and I have repeatedly received complaints from the people. I cannot remain silent. I sincerely hope that the Municipal Transportation Company will quickly find a way to fill the road surface, remove obstacles, or apply to the Public Works Bureau for assistance and cooperation to benefit travelers.

<p>Echeng Murder Case Appeals to the Capital for Justice</p>
<p>The Jiang and Hu families in Echeng County, Hubei, share a large lake called Ya'er Lake. They take fish and grass from the lake for fertilizing the fields, which often leads to disputes. In March 1936, another dispute arose over harvesting grass in the lake. The Jiang family secretly hid guns and ammunition in advance. During the dispute, they gathered a crowd and opened fire, killing eleven members of the Hu family on the spot and seriously injuring sixty-seven. After the incident, the magistrate of Echeng County personally inspected the scene. The Hu family took care of the aftermath and applied to the county government for legal action. Because the case was serious, Hu Airong was appointed to represent the victimized families to petition the Executive Yuan. In July 1936, Chiang Kai-shek, the President of the Executive Yuan, instructed the Hubei Provincial Government to investigate and deal with the matter seriously. Sixteen criminals, including Jiang Bohua, were arrested one after another and interrogated by the Echeng County Judicial Office. In April 1937, the Sixth Branch of the Hubei High Court sentenced two to death, four to life imprisonment, and ten to ten years imprisonment. Because of the appeal, none of the sentences were carried out. Later, due to the Japanese invasion of Wuhan, the government moved west. The sixteen criminals who had been sentenced took the opportunity to bribe the guards during the escort to the west and escaped home, where they lived freely during the enemy and puppet regime. In August last year, when Japan surrendered and our government returned, the Hu family continued to ask the Echeng County Government to arrest them. Unexpectedly, it has been a year since the application, and not a single criminal has been captured, and not a single gun has been recovered. Although the Sixth Branch of the Hubei High Court and the Hubei Provincial Security Command successively ordered the Echeng County Government to handle the case according to law, the county government transferred the order to the township office, and the township office transferred the application to the bao. The order was transferred down layer by layer, and they did not directly arrest them according to law, allowing nearly 100 criminals to live freely at home without being arrested and interrogated. Those who had been sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or fixed-term imprisonment but had escaped were also not wanted according to law. Ai Gu recently returned from Chongqing and believes that this extremely serious murder case has not been dealt with anywhere. He has to come to the capital to submit a petition to the Executive Yuan and various senior competent authorities for justice, and also asks all circles to uphold justice.

<h3 id="e72">Ten Nazi War Criminals Executed on Gallows; Goering Commits Suicide in Prison; Three-Person Committee Formed to Investigate Truth of Matter <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nuremberg, 16th] Shortly after Goering committed suicide by poisoning in prison, ten Nazi war criminals were executed one by one in the prison gymnasium under brilliantly lit conditions, ascending the thirteen-step platform. The first to be executed was Hitler's Foreign Minister, Ribbentrop, at 1:11 AM. The last was Jodl at 2:45 AM (9:45 AM Shanghai time). After the executions, the Four-Power Commission overseeing the Nazi war criminals released a statement confirming that the convicts had been executed according to law. Goering, however, had committed suicide by poisoning at 10:45 PM. Bavarian Governor Hoegner and Nuremberg Chief Prosecutor Reisner, as witnesses for the German people, examined Goering's body. Goering was lying in bed with a small glass tube of potassium cyanide in his mouth. He made a sound in his throat before the doctors and priests arrived and then died. Authorities began investigating this morning to discover how the poison was smuggled in. Goering had drafted two letters before his death, stored in a sealed envelope, one of which appeared to be addressed to the prison warden.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nuremberg, 16th] A three-person committee has been formed to investigate Goering's sudden suicide before his execution. According to McNair, an official with the US Information Service, the committee will be chaired by a US military officer, but the names of the three committee members have not been announced. When asked whether Goering's wife would be arrested, McNair simply repeated what he had said above.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Nuremberg, 16th] Security was tight in the prison before the execution of the eleven Nazi war criminals. American guards were stationed outside each cell, constantly inspecting, and rotating shifts every two hours. The Nazi war criminals sentenced to death had to sleep facing the wall every night, with their hands exposed outside the blanket. If they accidentally turned over in their sleep, the guards would enter the cell to restore them to their original position, so their faces could be observed at all times. One hour before the execution, the number of guards increased significantly. The sentries were equipped with Thompson submachine guns and pistols. The Nazi war criminals had no hope of escaping execution. But suddenly, the impossible happened: Goering was sleeping in bed, facing the wall, and did not violate the rules, but suddenly made a strange noise. It was 10:45 PM last night. The guards looked in through the small hole, and after seeing the situation, they were extremely alarmed and immediately notified the duty officer, who immediately summoned doctors and priests. They rushed into the prison and found Goering lying across the bed, already dead. The official announcement of Goering's suicide was made by Colonel Andrews, the commander of the prison. He said: "We are currently investigating how Goering was able to hide the poison, because the prisoners' clothes are searched very carefully every day." As for the nature of the poison, it was obviously the same as that carried by ordinary Nazis and that found on Goering when he was brought into prison.</p>
<h3 id="e73">A Glimpse of the Execution: The Dying Words Differed Among the Convicts <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nuremberg, 16th] The final act of the German tragedy was performed tonight in the Nuremberg prison execution ground. Ten Nazi war criminals were hanged, while Göring committed suicide by taking poison beforehand. The news of Göring's suicide was announced by the court marshal at midnight, causing quite a shock. To prevent further accidents, the court had all other convicts wear handcuffs when they were brought to the platform. The execution ground was located in a secret room, where three gallows stood, painted dark green. Two of the gallows were used in rotation, while the other was kept in reserve. There were 45 observers, including four representatives from the Allied Control Council, guards, military doctors, eight journalists, and interpreters. The bottom of the gallows was covered with a thick curtain, which concealed the bodies when they were hoisted up after the mechanism was triggered. Ribbentrop (former Foreign Minister) was the first to enter the execution ground. After the interpreter verified his identity, Ribbentrop climbed the steps to the gallows. When he reached the top, the interpreter asked if he had any last words. Ribbentrop replied that he hoped for world peace and asked God to save Germany. After speaking, the two executioners placed the noose around his neck. The mechanism was triggered, and a loud bang echoed like a cannon shot, breaking the silence in the room. Ribbentrop's body disappeared behind the curtain. The remaining convicts were executed in order. After each execution, the military doctor confirmed the death before the body was removed. The last words of the convicts differed. Sauckel (former leader of the Sturmabteilung) hoped to protect Germany. Jodl (former Chief of the Army Staff) shouted "Long live Germany!" Seyss-Inquart (former Governor of Austria and the occupied Netherlands) hoped that this execution would end the final tragedy of World War II. Keitel (former Commander-in-Chief of the Army) asked God to have mercy on the German people and shouted, "Sacrifice everything for the country!" Kaltenbrunner (former Chief of the Security Police) said, "Die in loyalty to the country." Streicher (the notorious Jewish executioner) rushed into the execution ground shouting "Heil Hitler!" Then, in a hoarse voice, he yelled, "The communists will hang you all one day, goodbye!" Suddenly, he became calm and optimistic, saying, "God, my Father, I am coming!" Finally, he shouted, "Adele, my dear wife." Frank (former Governor of Poland) did not say a word before his death. The last to be executed was Frick (former Governor of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia), who shouted, "Long live eternal Germany!" By 2:52 AM, the last rope was cut, the body was removed, and the task was completed.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nuremberg, 16th] Following Ribbentrop to the gallows was Keitel, who was wearing his uniform and black boots when he died, maintaining the same calm demeanor as during his trial. When his handcuffs were removed and he was bound with leather straps, he stood with his head held high. He ascended the last thirteen steps to the gallows with a solemn air, as if he were mounting a reviewing stand to salute soldiers, displaying the arrogance and haughtiness that fully represented the spirit of a Prussian officer. Onlookers unanimously agreed that Keitel was the bravest of the ten who were hanged. Keitel spoke his last words in a complete and clear tone, saying, "May God bless the German people. More than two million German soldiers have already sacrificed themselves for the country, and I am now following them underground. I am not afraid of death, I regard death as going home, sacrificing everything for Germany!" Keitel was a soldier in life and remained a soldier in death.</p>

<p>[United News, Nuremberg, 16th] The bodies of Göring and the other eleven were placed in covered cargo trucks today and sped out of the Nuremberg prison under the guard of armed soldiers. According to Captain Bente of the Security Police Detachment, the destination of the bodies will be kept secret. However, it is speculated that a portion of the journey will be by airplane, which is likely correct. When the trucks drove out, military police with machine guns rode in two jeeps as escorts, and a brigadier general followed in a black car. The vehicles sped away, making two round trips in Nuremberg before finally heading towards Fürth. There are two airfields in that area. At the time, the airfield was dark, with only a few personnel present, who seemed unaware of any special event. The vehicles then turned towards Erlangen, where there is another airfield. Military police set up roadblocks along the road in that area, making it impossible to track the vehicles further.</p>

<p>[United Press, Nuremberg, 15th] The eleven German convicts have only a few hours of life left. Their last supper was very simple, consisting of only a bowl of porridge, a few slices of bread, and a cup of coffee. According to prison guards, the convicts are able to maintain composure. These people will be executed after midnight. A deathly silence has thickly enveloped the dark Nuremberg prison tonight, and the executioners are also preparing. The first to be executed is rumored to be Göring, followed by Ribbentrop. Several hours before midnight, the sky over Nuremberg is cold and gray, with signs of rain or snow. American troops are stationed around the prison to provide tight security to prevent prison break attempts, and anyone without special business is not allowed to enter. Aircraft are also prohibited from flying overhead.</p>
<p>Göring Receives a Flood of Strange Letters</p>
<p>During the day, Göring received sixteen letters, mostly strange. Keitel requested that the prison guards notify him shortly before he was taken to the gallows so that he could tidy up his cell to make it clean before leaving. All convicts except Göring took a ten- to twenty-minute walk in the prison corridor. Prison press officers said that the execution results will not be announced before 4:00 AM standard time (noon on Wednesday, Shanghai time). All prisoners except Nazi philosopher Rosenberg sought comfort in prayer during the last few hours, and most were writing wills. Göring, who was next to Hitler in terms of the severity of his crimes, told the prison doctor that he was not afraid of death and would face it as if he were going home.</p>
<p>Terrifying Visages</p>
<p>[United Press, Nuremberg, 15th] American journalist Smith was allowed to enter the Nuremberg prison to observe the execution of the German convicts. He sent his first dispatch tonight, saying: Entering the heavily guarded corridors of Nuremberg prison, I looked through the cracks in the cell doors to see the conditions of Göring and Hitler's other assistants before their deaths. The faces of the eleven convicts all revealed a helpless and terrifying expression. The once invincible Göring was now sitting on a small iron bed, which previously only held ordinary prisoners, and had never borne such a heavy burden. A U.S. soldier was guarding Göring's cell. I saw that Göring's huge head was full of rage, resentment, and inner pain.</p>
<p>The Listless Nazi Foreign Minister</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] American journalist Smith sent a second dispatch stating that after seeing Göring, I saw Ribbentrop in the next cell. He stared blankly, his eyes dull, his expression listless, and his clothes were untidy. The cell was cluttered, and he shuffled around in it with an arrogant attitude. Next, I saw the former German Army Commander-in-Chief Keitel. He paced around his cell with his hands clasped behind his back. Judging from his expression, he seemed to be suffering greatly inside. He clenched his teeth as if trying hard to suppress this pain.</p>
<p>An Ape Having His Last Meal</p>
<p>The next cell was occupied by Sauckel, the former leader of the German Sturmabteilung. He was having a meal. His body was more like that of an ape than a human. I shuddered at the sight and left immediately.</p>

Byrnes firmly believed that the four powers would not fail to agree because he had great confidence in public opinion. Byrnes did not believe that any foreign minister could refuse to recognize the issues that had already received a two-thirds vote. Byrnes' words were clearly in response to Molotov's statement that he had advocated reconsidering some of the peace treaty stipulations that had been passed by a majority vote. Byrnes expressed regret over Yugoslavia's withdrawal from the peace conference and hoped that the country would change its attitude before the foreign ministers' meeting. Byrnes pointed out that the peace treaty with Japan would be delayed. At the suggestion of French Foreign Minister Bidault, the next topic to be discussed will be the peace treaty with Germany. When asked by reporters whether the Paris Peace Conference had damaged international relations, Byrnes replied that he did not see any damage. Byrnes continued, stating that the division between East and West was not created in Paris, but had become more evident in the peace conference.</p>

<p>Details of the Nomonhan Incident Still to Be Released</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 16th] Soviet prosecutors presented documents in the Far East Court today proving that the defendants, former Kwantung Army Chief of Staff Seishiro Itagaki and former Minister of War Araki Sadao, had already planned to invade Outer Mongolia as early as 1936. Records in the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs archives stated that on March 28 of that year, Itagaki told former Ambassador Arita Hachiro: "Looking at the map of the Far East, one can see the importance of Outer Mongolia to Japan and 'Manchukuo' because it protects the defenses of the Siberian Railway, which is the main route between the Soviet Union's Far Eastern part and Europe. If Outer Mongolia is merged with Japan and 'Manchukuo,' the Soviet Union's Far Eastern territory will be in great danger, and the Soviet Union's power in the Far East will disappear without a fight. Therefore, the military's goal is to do its best to extend the power of Japan and 'Manchukuo' into Outer Mongolia." Soviet prosecutors then excerpted an article by Araki entitled "The Mission of Japan in the Showa Era," which stated: "Japan does not want ambiguous regions, such as Outer Mongolia, to be near its sphere of influence. In any case, Mongolia should be the Mongolia of the Orientals and should be granted independence, peace, and tranquility. The Mongolian issue has become a greater obstacle to promoting the imperial way than the 'Manchurian' issue. Here, we must declare that we have the determination to destroy any country that attacks the imperial way." Soviet Deputy Prosecutor Detvofs said: "This document is only preliminary evidence. Details about the 1939 Japanese attack on Outer Mongolia at the Nomonhan Incident will be released later."</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 15th] President Truman's announcement yesterday that he would lift meat price controls on a scheduled basis and accelerate the removal of wage management has quickly had a wide-ranging impact.

The price of pork at a butcher shop in Washington has risen from 43 cents a pound to one dollar. Price Administrator Bowles issued a statement saying that the agency plans to maintain price controls on important items until supply and demand are balanced. Price controls will remain in place for cars, building materials, and furniture, which are in short supply.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 15th] Recent public opinion polls in the United States have shown that the prestige of the Democratic Party has declined and the Republican Party has risen. 57% of those surveyed said they would support the Republican Party in the next election.

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The municipal house at No. 174 Changzhi Road is the property of the British company Talley &amp; Co. Before the Anti-Japanese War, it was rented and used by Lianxing Ni Company. In March of this year, the company planned to resume business at the original address and signed a lease with Talley &amp; Co. to continue the lease. However, the receiving and management office of Wuxian informed the company on September 10 that the house had been approved for lease to others and ordered the company to move out by a certain date. According to a letter from the Ni Rong Business Bureau Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Municipal Government to request the cancellation of the above-mentioned order.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] After Miss Panda arrived in Shanghai, she resided on the top floor of the slaughterhouse on Feilun Road. Her spirit was quite weak, so the escorting authorities do not intend to display her publicly. It is reported that the injury to Miss Panda's foot when she was captured has not yet healed. The wound is being treated by the medical officer with Sulfadiazin ointment, but because Miss Panda often licks it with her tongue, she swallows the medicine, resulting in a very poor appetite. They will now switch to other medicines with the same properties that do not affect appetite. The International Publicity Office contacted an aircraft for Miss Panda yesterday and planned to send her abroad today, but due to the limited time, it is feared that it will not be possible to leave today.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Third Meeting of the Port Affairs Reorganization Committee: Discussing Suppressing Theft in the Port, Dredging Waterways, and Adjusting Docks <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Port Affairs Reorganization Committee held its third meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday in the Municipal Government Conference Room. Mayor Wu, Zhao Zukang, Zhao Zengjue, Zhang Fuyun, Ding Guitang, Yuan Jin, Liu Hongsheng, Li Jianhua, Xuan Tiewu (represented by Fang Zhichao), Ha Xiongwen, Wei Jimin (represented by Tang Yonggen), Zhang Xu, Li Guifan, Wei Huanzhang, Peng Chongwei, Ye Youqing and more than 20 other people attended.</p>
<p>Unified Guard Enhancement Control</p>
<p>Chaired by Chairman Wu, the following was discussed: (1) Drafting implementation measures to suppress theft in the port of Shanghai—Based on the results of the on-site investigation by the investigation and guard team, the main reasons for the theft in the city's port are: the management equipment of the wharves and warehouses of various ships is not comprehensive, the responsibilities of the operators at each stage are not clearly defined, and the institutions responsible for inspection and security cannot effectively control. The team now provides three preventive measures: (A) Strengthen the management and equipment of wharves and warehouses of ships, (B) Specify the responsibilities of operators at each stage, and (C) Unify the power of inspection and security and increase its control. It was decided that the above proposal should be sent to various shipping companies and relevant agencies for research and submit their opinions within one week for discussion.</p>
<p>Dredging and Repair Proposals Three Items</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the measures for dredging waterways, adjusting docks, and clearing warehouses, the Huangpu River channel is silted up year by year, and there must be a comprehensive dredging and repair plan. At yesterday's meeting, three proposals were made: (A) Order the Junpu Bureau to quickly restore all original equipment and expedite the dredging of the Huangpu River, (B) Reorganize the wharves of the Huangpu River before the war, and (C) Divide the wharves into areas for river boats, sea boats, and ocean-going boats. It was resolved to ask the Junpu Bureau to inform the owners of the dredging and surveying of the river channel and the recent investigation of each wharf of the deadline for repairs, and send a letter to the conference for submission to the Senate for inspection.</p>
<p>Escort Personnel Must Be Assessed</p>
<p>At the end of the meeting, Director Wu raised the issue of quickly investigating the storage situation of each warehouse to make them empty and merged, and to conduct a thorough investigation of the owners of each warehouse, so as to sign lease agreements or return them. Liu Hongsheng also pointed out that after the war, the total number of lighters in the port and the lighters in the general assembly device was 597. If all of them can be completed, it may be possible to alleviate some of the threat to transportation in the port. The meeting did not adjourn until after 12:00.</p>
<p>[Another Report] According to a person in charge of the police station who spoke to reporters: In order to strengthen wharf management and prevent theft, the bureau has decided to unify the management of maritime security. All escort personnel and guards employed by various shipping companies must pass the assessment of the police station. In the future, the police station will uniformly manage them to increase work efficiency. It is firmly believed that wharf theft can often be improved in the future.</p>

<p>At 11:00 AM yesterday, Bo Liang, the legal advisor of the U.S. Embassy, Ru Bao Yi, and U.S. Consul Che Brown visited the Municipal Land Administration Bureau together. Director Zhu met them in the conference room of the bureau. The two sides raised questions and discussed them in a very friendly atmosphere. It was agreed that: (1) U.S. citizens who own land and have obtained a perpetual lease should apply to the Land Administration Bureau for a land ownership certificate in accordance with the treaty regulations. Those who have not yet obtained a perpetual lease should first apply for registration and then issue a land ownership certificate. (2) If the name on the deed is a U.S. citizen, but the actual owner is a Chinese citizen, the Chinese citizen should directly apply for registration with the Land Administration Bureau. (3) The Land Administration Bureau will not charge any fees for handling the replacement and registration procedures for U.S. citizens, in accordance with the new treaty. (4) U.S. owners will pay land value tax in accordance with the land price and tax rates stipulated by Chinese laws. The above discussions were quite satisfactory, and both parties were satisfied.</p>

<p>The American-owned China Electrical Company in this city had previously dismissed workers for organizing a trade union. After mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, they were allowed to return to work. However, when the workers returned to the factory yesterday morning, they were refused entry. The entire workforce was very angry and went on strike at around 10:00 AM yesterday. The company authorities requested the Social Affairs Bureau to take effective measures, while the workers believed that the company authorities had not implemented the agreement and should request arbitration from the Municipal Government. The company authorities then asked the Social Affairs Bureau to convene a temporary arbitration committee composed of the American Chamber of Commerce and relevant military and political agencies. The Social Affairs Bureau believed that the company's request was unreasonable and immediately refused, resulting in a stalemate. After the Social Affairs Bureau mediated in many ways, and with the strong persuasion of Liang Yongzhang, the representative of the General Labor Union, they first resumed work and then mediated again. The entire workforce resumed work at 4:30 PM, and mediation is scheduled to continue in the Social Affairs Bureau today.</p>

<p>[Report] The Public Works Committee subcommittee of the Municipal Council held a meeting at 4:30 PM yesterday in the conference room of the Municipal Public Works Bureau. Zhao Kang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, Tang Mingshi, Chief Secretary, Zhu Guoxi, Director of the Engineering Department, Qian Jifan, Commissioner, and more than ten people attended, chaired by Xi Yujin. Four cases were immediately discussed: (1) Approved the reconstruction of Hengfeng Bridge to build a permanent steel-concrete bridge with a load of 20 tons and active bridge lights. After the bridge is completed, it will facilitate the traffic of passengers at the North Station, Maigen Road Station, and the Caojiadu area in West Shanghai. The congested form of traffic in the central district can also be improved. In addition, the Zhabei area has been desolate after the war. In the future, passenger and freight transport from the North Station can take Xijiang Road, Changan Road, Maigen Road, and then turn into the Ka Line Road. The road map can be reduced by more than one-third, and it is expected to restore prosperity within one year. The cost of rebuilding the Hengfeng Bridge is estimated at 800 million yuan, which has been approved at yesterday's meeting. Construction will begin within this year, and it is expected to be completed next spring.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the construction funds for the Public Works Department in this city for this year, within the scope of the budget, the Finance Bureau should be requested to allocate them as soon as possible to facilitate construction. (3) Request the Ministry of Communications to allocate the Jinghu Highway. For building materials and expenses within the scope of this city, please ask the Municipal Government to request a supplementary allocation from the Central Government. (4) The bottleneck-style houses on the main roads are hindering traffic. The Public Works Bureau should plan to demolish them. The owners of the demolished houses should be subsidized for the demolition and repair costs, or relocation costs, and land requisition costs, while the owners who benefit from the roads on both sides should be charged a benefit fee. The proposal has been approved. As for its detailed plan and implementation methods, the Public Works Bureau will study it and submit it for discussion at the next meeting.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Mayor Wu hosted a banquet at his official residence at 7:00 PM last night for Xu Jiqing, Vice-Chairman of the Municipal Council, the conveners of each sub-committee, and the directors and heads of various bureaus of the Municipal Government. During the banquet, the serious electricity shortage facing the city was discussed, and it was decided in principle that the electricity consumption of various businesses and households in the city must be restricted. The restriction methods differ slightly for businesses and households, and it is believed that businesses should be stricter in order to save a large amount of electricity for the production of factories in the city. As for the restriction methods, it is heard that the amount of electricity used in the previous month will be used as the basis, with an 80% or 90% limit. As for the detailed methods, the Public Utilities Bureau will study and formulate them, and it is expected to be implemented starting on the first of next month.</p>
<p>Regarding the case previously decided by the Municipal Council that the single regulations of the Municipal Government must be passed by the Municipal Council, it is feared that there will be difficulties in practice, because there are often many things that must be implemented immediately. Therefore, three alternative methods were passed at yesterday's meeting to handle them according to the severity of the case: (1) The single regulations of the city will be reviewed by the sub-committee of the Council after being passed by the Municipal Government Meeting. (2) The single regulations of the city will be reviewed and passed by the sub-committee of the Council after being passed by the Municipal Government Meeting, and then ratified when the General Assembly is convened. (3) For important cases, such as orders from the Central Government, they can be implemented immediately without going through the review steps of the Municipal Council. As for how to distinguish the severity of their nature, it will be jointly decided by the Municipal Government Counselor's Office and the Legal Affairs Sub-Committee of the Council.</p>

<p>The trial of 27 Nazi war criminals, accused by the U.S. military of endangering the Allied countries, has been going on for nearly a month. Yesterday, former Japanese military liaison officer Aoyama Harumitsu testified, recalling the activities of German and Japanese spies in Shanghai. They obtained a great deal of information in Shanghai, which was first sent to the Third Air Force Command of the Japanese Army in Hankou, and then transferred from Hankou to the Japanese Army in Nanjing, or directly to Tokyo. Even before Germany surrendered, the Germans had already been employed by the Japanese army and were working under the Japanese. After Germany surrendered, the espionage activities of the German and Japanese became more active, and Italians were used as telegraph operators to carry out communications work. Aoyama Harumitsu was the liaison officer at the time, so he knew the details very well. He was questioned by both the prosecutor and the defense lawyer. Each Nazi war criminal sat by and listened, taking notes. The case is scheduled for a retrial this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Japanese Military Atrocities - Too Numerous to Count - War Crimes Oversight Team Returns from Northeast - Welcome Meeting and Report by Zou Renzhi <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] For fourteen years, the Northeast was occupied, and the number of Chinese citizens whose lives and property were sacrificed under the iron heel of the Japanese military is countless. Now that the skies have cleared and the sun shines again, and the Japanese enemy has surrendered, Japanese war criminals in various locations are being successively subjected to the sanctions of our national law. The atrocities of the past fourteen years should be accounted for. However, these criminals have now found other places to live, resulting in them remaining at large!</p>
<p>The Northeast Oversight Team of the War Crimes Handling Committee has returned from the Northeast. According to the team leader, Zou Renzhi (who is also the Director of the War Crimes Management Office of the Ministry of National Defense), at yesterday's welcome tea party, the various ways in which the Japanese invaders enslaved and poisoned the Northeast were truly hair-raising. Zou first presented and explained in detail over forty pieces of photographic evidence of Japanese war crimes brought back by the team from the Northeast. Some of these photos depicted the Japanese military beheading compatriots, dismembering bodies for live sacrifices, and other scenes too gruesome to bear. He then reported on the actual situation of Japanese war criminals in the Northeast, stating that there were at least 600,000 to 700,000 Japanese troops in the Northeast, but only a very small and insignificant portion remain. Among those reported by the public for war crimes, given the vast area of the Northeast, there are only two to three hundred people, including only two or three major generals and brigadier generals!</p>
<p>Recent Situation in the Northeast</p>
<p>When discussing the recent situation in the Northeast, Zou stated that the Japanese always regarded the Northeast as part of Japan, hence Puyi was referred to as "Emperor" rather than "Huang (Sovereign)," and people in the puppet organizations had to refer to Japan as the "Parent State." The written language and spoken language were also influenced, being called the "Concord Language." For example, we would say "Wan le (finished)" at the end of a sentence, but the people of the Northeast have replaced it with "Yi shang (the above)." The intelligence of young students is generally below standard. During the fourteen years of occupation, the Japanese did carry out considerable construction in the Northeast, but it was the blood and sweat of our Northeast compatriots that flowed, while the Japanese reaped the benefits. Every year, over a million compatriots were mobilized. During the construction of the Xiaofengman Hydroelectric Plant, the most famous project in the Northeast, as many as 300,000 compatriots died from the work! As for the poisonous acts of the Japanese military police against patriotic compatriots, they are truly hair-raising. There were underground passages leading to various places, about two to three zhang (6-10 meters) high and wide, with many small rooms, all so-called "secret rooms." Anyone considered to be ideologically "anti-Manchu and anti-Japanese" would be abused there. In some cases, entire villages were "subjugated," and all the compatriots were killed. The evidence of the Japanese poisoning schemes is everywhere in the Northeast. For example, outside the East Gate of Shenyang, there was a "Bureau for the Prohibition of Opium Workshops," which was actually an opium manufacturing facility. There were also heroin factories and morphine factories.</p>
<p>Missing Women</p>
<p>After the Northeast was recovered, the National Army was unable to immediately move in, and order was disrupted. At the time of recovery, it was discovered that over 20,000 women had gone missing! Furthermore, because Japanese women who married Chinese men could avoid repatriation, many hastily married Chinese citizens, with 5,000 couples already registered. The lives of Japanese residents were generally not very prosperous due to repeated upheavals, and many Japanese women became prostitutes, among whom syphilis was very prevalent. The housing shortage is currently very serious in the Beijing and Shanghai areas, but the Northeast has a situation of many houses and few people. As for the female movie stars of the puppet Manchukuo regime, almost all of them have married American soldiers stationed there.</p>
<p>"Another Visit" The war crimes oversight team, a group of five people, went to Beijing last night to report on their duties. The team representatives gathered a great deal of information during this trip to the Northeast. The details are recorded below to provide a glimpse into the atrocities committed by the Japanese in the Northeast:</p>
<p>Record of Atrocities</p>
<p>(1) "Great Arrest" in Shenyang: In early December of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), incidents of sabotage of railways by volunteer armies occurred in Tie Ling, Kaiyuan, Dashiqiao, and other places near Sujiazhai in the southern part of Shenyang. Morita, the Japanese military police captain stationed in Shenyang, instructed his subordinates to carry out large-scale arrests inside and outside Shenyang City for two consecutive weeks. More than 400 people were arrested. After interrogation, more than 130 were deemed to have committed crimes, including party and government personnel, and military police officers. Among them, Tan Gan, a member of the party, escaped from prison at night, along with seventy others. The Japanese military then vented their anger on the remaining prisoners, torturing them severely and arbitrarily arresting family members and others involved, totaling 400 people, of whom 160 died from torture.</p>
<p>(2) "Great Arrest" in Andong: In April of the 21st year of the Republic (1932), a Japanese police chief named Omachi, while conducting a household survey in Andong County, discovered suspicious letters and arrested a party member named Gao. He then carried out a raid on anti-Japanese elements, affecting Shenyang, Yingkou, and other places. More than 1,500 CCP members from Zhejiang were arrested, of whom only a dozen survived.</p>
<p>(3) "Great Arrest" in Jilin (the Yuwencheng Middle School Incident): After the September 18th Incident, Liu Gangzhong, the person in charge of the Northeast Party Affairs Office in Beiping, sent Liu Jinglan, Zheng Zhi Kuan, and others to Jilin to contact party members there and organize the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. In early February of the 24th year of the Republic (1935), the matter was discovered by the puppet Manchukuo Jilin Police Department due to remittance issues, and more than 60 people were arrested. Among them, Li Guanghan, the principal of Yuwen Middle School, and four others died in prison under severe torture. The rest were sentenced to imprisonment until their release in the 26th year of the Republic (1937). However, they were mentally disturbed and physically disabled.</p>
<p>Also, in May of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), in Panshan County, Jilin Province, Wang Dianchen led his men to destroy the railway. The secret was leaked, and they were arrested by the Japanese military, resulting in thousands of casualties.</p>
<p>(4) Harbin Incident: In December of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), several patriotic individuals in Harbin agreed with the volunteer army in the Songhua River and Heilongjiang area to launch an uprising in Songpu, north of Harbin. They were secretly reported to the puppet Manchukuo Binjiang Police Department by a traitor named Dong, who mobilized a search and killed them all, without a single survivor. This is the so-called "December 31st" Incident.</p>
<p>(5) "Great Subjugation" Incident in the Eastern Border Region: From the 23rd to the 25th year of the Republic (1934-1936) and from the 27th to the 29th year of the Republic (1938-1940), the Japanese military carried out two major subjugations in the "Eastern Border Region," resulting in approximately 6,000 victims. Countless villages and houses were burned. At that time, there was a Japanese lieutenant colonel in the Japanese military who was particularly fond of killing, and he personally beheaded approximately 160 people.</p>
<p>(6) Large-Scale Sweep in the Dunhua Area: In the winter of the 25th year of the Republic (1936), the Japanese military began a "large-scale sweep" in the area from Dunhua to Jingpo Lake. The commander, Lieutenant Colonel Tsukino, and others burned villages and killed people, which was extremely inhumane. The number of victims reached three to four thousand, with villages reduced to ruins and displaced people everywhere. Moreover, it was during the harsh winter, and countless people died from freezing and starvation.</p>
<p>(7) Chen Hanzhang Incident: In the summer of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), Chen Hanzhang, a teacher at Jilin Middle School, was forced to revolt, and four to five thousand people responded, becoming active in the mountainous areas of central Jilin. As a result, the Japanese military launched a large-scale "subjugation." Chen's forces were unable to resist and suffered many casualties, retreating into Soviet territory. They re-emerged the following spring, robbing weapons from puppet military police in Dunhua and Mingyuegou. Later, due to being pursued by enemy and puppet forces, they retreated to the Dahuanggou area in eastern Dunhua, where they ran out of ammunition and food. Chen was wounded and committed suicide, and most of his troops were massacred.</p>
<p>(8) "Great Arrest" Incident of December 30th: On December 30th of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), the enemy and puppets launched a "Great Arrest" throughout the Northeast, with a total of 355 people being arrested. They were later handed over to the puppet Manchukuo Ministry of Justice for processing, with 193 being prosecuted, 87 not being prosecuted, 9 being sentenced to death, and 18 being sentenced to life imprisonment. For details, see the book "Overview of the December 30th Incident" compiled by the Criminal Affairs Department of the puppet Manchukuo Ministry of Justice in June of the 11th year of Kangde (1944).</p>
<p>(9) Pingdingshan Massacre in Fushun: On the night of the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month in the 21st year of the Republic (1932), the volunteer army of Tang Juwu attacked the Fushun mining area and passed through Pingdingshan. Guan Chengyi, the person in charge of the Kuriyagawa Workers' Store in the coal mine, falsely claimed to have been robbed and colluded with local Japanese military police and Japanese personnel from the coal mine, gathering at Pingdingshan Qianjinzai Dongshan. At 2:00 p.m. on the 16th, they concentrated all the villagers, about 5,000 people from 350 households, on the Xishan side of Pingdingshan. They set fire to the houses and used machine guns to strafe the fleeing villagers. They then rushed into Xishan and used bayonets to stab more than 60 severely wounded people who were not dead in the chaotic piles of corpses. Only a dozen people survived. Regarding this case, in August of this year, the Northeast Security Commander's Office recently captured four war criminals related to the massacre: Tang Tianfan, Takahashi Keio, Nishiyama Shigeyuki, and Tu Zhi Feng.</p>
<p>(10) Crimes of the "Guandong Prefecture Police Bureau": According to Chapter 24, Section 5 of the "Thirty-Year History of Guandong Bureau Administration" (1936 edition), "Records of the Guandong Bureau Police Officers' Arrest of Anti-Manchu and Anti-Japanese Elements and Pacification Work during the Manchurian Incident": "Political bandits," ideological bandits," and religious bandits," etc., in the Northeast amounted to 250,000. During the Japanese military's large-scale suppression of anti-Manchu and anti-Japanese elements, they successively arrested and "legally executed" them. The names of the "criminals" and the dates of arrest are listed in detail.</p>
<p>(11) Wanbaoshan Incident: The Wanbaoshan Incident began in the spring of the 20th year of the Republic (1931) and was also one of the major events of the Japanese invasion of China. The details of the incident have been recorded in detail in history. It has recently been learned that Hao Yongde, the main culprit of this massacre, who used Koreans to expand the incident when it occurred, has been captured by the inspection team of our New Sixth Army and sent to the Military Law Office of the Changchun Garrison Command for interrogation.</p>
<p>(12) Poisoning Policy: Secondly, this Northeast Oversight Team also conducted a detailed investigation into the truth of the enemy and puppet regimes' implementation of a poisoning policy in the Northeast. Before the "September 18th" Incident, the Japanese used the concession areas attached to the "South Manchuria Railway" as bases to harbor and transport large quantities of drugs. The Japanese Consul General did not prohibit it but instead encouraged Japanese merchants to sell them. By the 21st year of the Republic (1932), the puppet government, in order to increase its finances, established an opium monopoly system, setting up a special general bureau under the puppet Ministry of Economy, with special purchase offices and special purchase bureaus (totaling 108 bureaus) and special purchase sub-bureaus (totaling 190 bureaus) under it. The number of permitted opium dens was 2,100. The amount of opium sold was 13 million taels. The factories for manufacturing drugs were in Shenyang, and the opium raw material came from Rehe. The large quantities of opium they manufactured were promoted with trademarks such as "Fu (fortune), Lu (prosperity), Shou (longevity), Xi (happiness), Song (pine), Zhu (bamboo), Mei (plum), Lan (orchid)" as rewards. In the 27th year of the Republic (1938), the opium monopoly was stopped and transferred to the "Ministry of People's Livelihood," which established the "General Bureau for the Prohibition of Opium," with 145 "Kang Sheng Hospitals" and 1,800 "Ying Yan Offices" under it. At this point, the opium public sale system was superficially abolished, but in reality, the "Ministry of People's Livelihood" also sold it. By the 30th year of the Republic (1941), after the Pacific War, the Japanese planned to increase their financial income, abolish the "Kang Sheng Hospitals" in various places, and increase the quantity of opium sold. They also greatly expanded the areas for opium cultivation. In addition to Rehe Province, Liaoning, Liaobei, Jilin, and other provinces implemented large-scale group cultivation of opium. They also transported large quantities to Nanjing, Shanghai, and other areas for dumping.

<p>Zai Yan Jinshi, President of the Economic News Agency and Specialist Committee Member of the Economic Committee of the Northeast Provisional Headquarters, recently flew to Shenyang at the invitation of Chairman Zhang Jia'ao. He returned to Shanghai a few days ago and gave the following impressions of the Northeast: (1) The patriotism of the people in the nine northeastern provinces is no less than that of those in the interior. The desire for peace is especially strong. (2) The economic order of the nine northeastern provinces is gradually recovering. Zhang Gongquan, the economic leader, is very eager for young and ambitious people to go there, work hard, and build a new Northeast. (3) The financial situation in Shenyang is good, with low interest rates. The general public has no concept of interest, and there is no possibility for speculators to exist. Therefore, the Northeast can be called a "paradise for doers." (4) Although the industry in the Northeast has been destroyed, it is not a great loss. The Japanese economic construction in the past was entirely to cooperate with their military aggression. If it is maintained as it is, it will not conform to our national conditions. It is necessary to re-establish an economic construction plan. (5) What the Northeast lacks most is cotton cloth and industrial raw materials. The exportable goods are coarse grains. The authorities welcome barter trade.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yongchang Cigarette Shop at No. 65 Fengyang Road in this city was recently investigated by the Finance Bureau and found to have committed the crime of evading taxes by forging accounts. It is said that the amount of concealed business revenue reached as high as 2 billion yuan. Since taking over the business tax, the Finance Bureau has been actively rectifying and intensifying investigations. In mid-September, Inspector Yang Wenguang of the Bureau suspected that Yongchang Cigarette Shop was evading taxes. After three weeks of continuous investigation, he learned that Lu Tongshun Flower Shop at No. 85 on the same road had concealed real account books. He then, on the afternoon of the 15th (the other day), together with Inspectors Qiu Zhongming and Zhou Ding, and Investigator Tian Shengwen, investigated more than 20 fake and real account books.

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the victory, the Shanghai-Kouan line has been closed due to the special circumstances there. There are no regular sailing vessels. Recently, Bada Company dispatched the motorized sailboat "Hua Jin" on a trial voyage, sailing directly from Shanghai to Kouan, once every four days, without stopping at other ports. According to the company, the situation in that area has become peaceful, but the cargo is still scarce, only eggs and duck eggs, etc. Because passengers are not clear about the local situation, few people are going there. It is said that Tongxing Shipping Company will also open a Kouan route.</p>
<p>Transportation on the North-South ocean lines has recently become slightly quiet. The Southern Ocean line has been affected by the ban on shipping cotton yarn and cotton cloth to Fujian and Guangdong provinces, and the Northern Ocean line has been affected by the high prices of goods in Shanghai. The goods imported from the North-South ocean lines to Shanghai are entirely dependent on medicinal materials and fruits. The stock of timber in Fujian is sufficient and not easy to transport all at once.</p>
<p>The Daxing vessel has been issued a permit. The China Shipping Company's Tianlong vessel sailed to Qinhuangdao for the first time yesterday. Because the inspection procedures were not complete, the Maritime Affairs Bureau blocked its exit and supplemented the procedures separately.

After the victory, it was taken over by the China Merchants Bureau and renamed "Jiangli," sailing on the Yangtze River line. Xu Zhongxin, the manager of Daxing Company, applied to the Enemy Puppet Handling Bureau to transfer to China Merchants Bureau for return. The bureau had issued an order to return it on the 14th, and Xu Zhongxin of the company signed to receive it.</p>

According to the American President Lines, only three ships have arrived in Shanghai from the United States this month. The passenger ship "Manila Lynx" arrived at the port at noon on the 15th, and the cargo ship "Montal Davis" arrived in Shanghai yesterday. There is also the cargo ship "Montal Laugus," which is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai next week. The other passenger and cargo ships scheduled to arrive in Shanghai have been affected by the strike and will not be able to arrive in Shanghai this month. The Manila Lynx mail ship was originally scheduled to sail to the South Pacific today, but due to incomplete procedures, it has been changed to depart from Shanghai at 1:00 p.m. tomorrow, via Hong Kong to the Little Luzon, and then return directly to the United States from the Philippines, without coming to Shanghai again.</p>
<p>"It's good to stay at home for a thousand days, but it's difficult to take even one step out the door." I didn't expect this old saying to still be relevant today.

<h3 id="e136">Digging up Tombs - UNRRA Employee Accused in First Case - District Court Rules Against Hearing Part of the Case Against Defendant Hayes - Zhang Songzhou and Jin Zhixuan to be Investigated Separately Before Further Hearings <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Wang Detang and Wang Yunting, brothers, accused Hayes, an Australian and General Manager of the UNRRA Zhenru Machine Factory, Jin Zhixuan, the factory director, and Zhang Songzhou, the manager of Datong Bank, of privately digging up tombs and arbitrarily occupying the cemetery. The District Court held its fourth hearing yesterday. After a heated debate between the lawyers for both parties, the court ruled that the private prosecution filed by the plaintiff regarding Hayes's part would not be accepted. Hayes is the first UNRRA employee to be accused. The court refused to accept the case because it respected international agreements, which is also the first time for this case. After this case occurred, Major General Eggerton, Director of the UNRRA China Office, formally sent a letter to the President of the District Court, Zha Liangjian, on September 30th, proving that Hayes was a UNRRA employee. The defendant's lawyer also presented the "Basic Agreement between the Chinese Government and UNRRA," which stipulated that "UNRRA employees, when performing official duties, are exempt from any form of legal process for their actions within the scope of their duties," requesting the court not to accept the case. They also said that it was a matter of international reputation and should comply with the agreement. If the court accepted it, it would set a precedent, and UNRRA employees would have more troubles. The lawyers requested the court to seriously consider the decision. The plaintiff's lawyer argued that if the court did not accept the case, the people's lives and property would have no protection. The second defendant, Jin Zhixuan, said that he had not yet taken office when Wang's cemetery was used, and the former General Manager, Hayes, should be fully responsible. The third defendant, Zhang Songzhou, denied that he rented out the cemetery. After the debate ended, the court ruled that Hayes's part would not be accepted, and the parts of Zhang Songzhou and Jin Zhixuan would be investigated separately before being heard again at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Training Electrical Engineers: Power Company Acts as Examiner for Interns, to Send Part of Trainees to Northeast After Completion of Training <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai Power Company, to assist in the training of electrical technicians, previously jointly recruited intern technicians with the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau. As a result, eight people were admitted and started working at the company on September 1st. Recently, at the request of the Executive Yuan's Resources Committee, the company recruited another six intern technicians the day before yesterday. After two months of training, they will be sent to serve in the Northeast. Yesterday, our reporter made a special visit to Hu Wen'an, the officer in charge of the electrical engineering training class at the Power Company, to inquire about the training situation. According to him, before the war, the company recruited four or five new technicians each year. During the war, the enemy, in order to exclude the British as much as possible, recruited 40 or 50 Chinese personnel each year, resulting in a phenomenon of excessive Chinese personnel. To this day, there are still 43 people in training.</p>
<p>The organization of the training class is extremely strict. Five representatives from affiliated institutions such as power plants participate as members of the committee. There are also more than 20 people from various institutions responsible for training matters. The training period is four years, and the qualifications for candidates are limited to graduates of universities and specialized schools. After foreign students are admitted, the internship period is six months to one year. In this joint recruitment with the Public Utilities Bureau, more than 200 people applied, and more than 140 people were qualified. However, due to the limited number of places, four people each in electrical engineering and mechanical engineering were finally admitted. The electrical engineering majors were Yang Juntao, Cui Lunyuan, Shou Jican, and Zhou Qingchang. The mechanical engineering majors were Qian Zhongpeng, Zhu Wenyu, Feng Yimin, and Hong Fuyu. Six of them are graduates of Jiaotong University, one from Datong University, and one from Lin University. They are now assigned to practice at the Yangshupu Power Plant. In the future, they will be rotated and trained in more than 20 departments, such as the machine room, copper workshop, control room, pattern shop, chemical laboratory, and distribution room, with each department training for about one to three months.</p>
<p>As for the treatment, the starting basic salary is 80 yuan, calculated according to the workers' cost of living index, and then increased by 20 yuan each year. Upon completion of the internship, the salary will be paid according to the performance, ranging from 175 yuan to 250 yuan. However, the company is not responsible for signing contracts with interns. They can be dismissed at any time during the internship period, and continued employment is not guaranteed after the period expires. The company's aspect is purely an obligation training nature, and the annual cost will reach tens of millions of yuan.</p>

He will give serious consideration to this matter and may decide within two days.</p>

The second-level staff includes foreigners employed locally (who have not requested a salary increase this time) and are paid based on the cost of living index. The second-level Chinese staff are included in the third standard. It is heard that the Chinese staff are now requesting the same treatment as foreign staff of the same level, with a minimum salary of 600,000 yuan. In addition, they are also requesting various employee benefits such as receiving rations.</p>

In the future, the work trend is to actively develop in the Northeast and Taiwan. Following Wang Yebai, the director of the Ganxi Coal Mine Bureau, reporting on the domestic coal industry situation, Zhang Yue, the representative of the group, delivered a reply, briefly stating that the internship in the United States was a good experience. American modernization is admirable. He believes that if the country goes through a period of considerable stability, the future of construction can gradually catch up. According to Zhang Yue's later remarks to the reporter, the original plan was for a total of 93 interns sent by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Resources Committee to return on the Hai Mao liner. Because they could not be gathered in one place at one time, a total of 85 people returned first. The Resources Committee accounted for 28 people, including 11 in mining, 12 in metallurgy, 4 in industrial and mining management, and 1 in water conservancy. The rest belonged to the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

<p>[Our Report] We Chinese people attach importance to "one mind, no dual use" when reading and writing, but now there is a calligrapher, Mr. Zhao Moseng, who can write two different lines of characters simultaneously with his left and right hands. When writing couplets, he must write the upper and lower couplets at the same time. Recently, in order to raise funds for the relocation and construction of the Yawei Stenography School in Shanghai, Zhao was invited to Shanghai to hold an exhibition at the YMCA in Baxianqiao and perform on the spot. The audience was very enthusiastic. Mr. Zhao is a native of Shandong. He is 30 years old. He was born with extraordinary talent. He was good at calligraphy at the age of seven. At the age of nine, he studied calligraphy with Wang Shoupeng, the champion of the late Qing Dynasty, and was known as a child prodigy. His practice of writing with both hands simultaneously began in the 28th year. After painstaking deliberation, he was able to use it freely in the winter of the 30th year. When Zhao was in Chongqing, he also gathered 300 students around the age of thirteen at the Jiangbei Primary School in Chongqing and taught them simultaneous calligraphy with both hands for one hour every day. After six months of training, the results were very satisfactory, and each child was able to write with both hands at the same time. Later, Zhao performed 12 times for the Oriental Art Academy and the National Art Museum, and then went to Yunnan to perform. Hundreds of thousands of people watched, and those who asked for his calligraphy were always waiting in line. The US Information Service also filmed a film of simultaneous calligraphy with both hands and distributed it for screening in various places.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Trial of Counterfeit Currency Case Held Yesterday Morning <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] In the case of cracking down on the counterfeit currency manufacturing organization in Nanxiang by the Inspection Office of the Songhu Garrison Command last month, all the criminals, Bao Jiasheng, Zhu Axiang, Chen Bohuan, Zhang Jianliang, Qin Rongchang, Huang Rongquan, Zhang Jinsheng, Yu Delong, Che Lanru, and other nine people, were prosecuted by the prosecutor for the crime of counterfeiting currency. The court initially decided to open a trial yesterday morning. Because the lawyer defending the defendant had not received the indictment, after briefly questioning the defendants in court, it was ordered that the hearing be adjourned. According to the confessions of the defendants at the District Procuratorate, Bao Jiasheng is a copperplate engraving expert who engraved the copperplate of "Central Reserve Coupons" during the enemy and puppet period. After the victory, Bao could not continue to manufacture counterfeit banknotes because he had no capital. In January of this year, Bao met Zhu Axiang through Qin Rongchang's introduction in the Dadong Tea House, and then, through Zhu's introduction, he joined Chen Bohuan, Zhang Jianliang, and other five people to contribute capital of 2 million yuan. Chang immediately purchased machinery and supplies and hired printing workers Huang Rongquan and Zhang Jinsheng. They rented a house in Nanxiang to specialize in making counterfeit banknotes with a denomination of 2,000 yuan. Yu Delong and Che Lanru used them externally. The total amount of printing has reached more than 100 million yuan, and the amount used externally has also been as high as tens of millions of yuan.</p>

<p>(1) Inheritance Tax</p>
<p>Chen Shumin asked: After my friend Xu's father passed away last year, his brothers divided the inheritance, but the land part was not transferred at that time. It was not until April of this year that they started to go through the transfer procedures. May I ask: (1) For the industry inherited one year before the implementation of the inheritance tax, do I need to retroactively levy taxes? (2) Does the ownership of property take effect from the date the contract is established, or from the date the registration and transfer procedures are completed?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replied] (1) No retroactive payment is required. (2) The transfer of property ownership of real estate takes effect upon registration.</p>
<p>(2) Using Two Names Simultaneously</p>
<p>Zhou Xiaoping asked: My friend Zhang Yunqing, 43 years old this year, was born seven years before the Republic of China. At that time, due to local customs, his father inherited his maternal grandfather and changed his name to Chen Defu. Therefore, one person has two names, which are used interchangeably. Now I have several questions and ask for your legal instructions. (1) The current law has restrictions on using two names. This is a fait accompli before the era. Is it necessary to make corrections? (2) The original name Zhang Yunqing is filled in on the national ID card, and the inherited name Chen Defu is filled in the alias column. Is this legal? (3) When filling in the household registration, should I fill in according to the ID card or report the original name? (4) Both surnames and two names have real estate registration. Does this violate current law?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replied] (1) It should be corrected according to the law. (2) (3) This is a household registration issue. Please inquire at the Civil Affairs Office of the Municipal Government. (4) It violates the law.</p>
<p>(3) Apprentice Complaint</p>
<p>A reader asked: I was introduced by a friend to a small department store in the spring of the 33rd year to serve as an apprentice. It has been two years and six months since then. Due to the hardship of life, I am no different from a cow or a horse. If this continues, I have no hope for the future. Therefore, I am unwilling to do this meaningless work anymore. I plan to work elsewhere and implement work-study. Now I want to leave the store, but the boss has repeatedly obstructed me, using the excuse that I have not yet completed my apprenticeship. Now I have several questions: (1) Is the boss guilty of abusing the apprentice for no reason? (2) If I leave without saying goodbye because I can't bear it anymore, is it legal? (3) Is it reasonable to resign before completing the apprenticeship? (4) Should I compensate for food expenses when resigning? (5) Is the three-year apprenticeship system applicable today?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai replied] (1) Crimes are determined according to the consequences of abuse; (2) The contract should be terminated according to the law; (3) You may not resign before termination; (4) You should compensate for food expenses if you resign for no reason; (5) This is a social issue.</p>

<p>Maintaining Sovereignty and Demonstrating Patriotism During the War of Resistance</p>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, we received 120,000 yuan in legal tender from Mr. Zhu Fanseng of the Jianghai Customs, which was donated by more than 50 crew members of the Huaqiang Wheel from their frugality to the Qingxia Elderly Orphan and Poor Relief Fund sponsored by this column. According to Mr. Zhu, the ship was originally owned by the Huasheng Shipping Company in this city. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression in the 26th year, it changed to flying the Dutch flag and continued to sail on the North and South Pacific routes. On December 8, the 30th year of the Republic of China, when the Pacific War broke out, the ship happened to be chartered to a foreign merchant in Japan to load coal. After hearing the news, all the crew members sailed the ship away from Japan overnight. The two Japanese guards on board were also monitored. They experienced all kinds of difficulties along the way. They were intercepted by Japanese ships, but they were able to turn danger into safety and sailed to Seattle, USA. At that time, the Dutch shipowner of the ship tried to take advantage of the opportunity to seize the ship for himself. After being opposed by all the crew members, the ship was requisitioned by the US military. After Japan surrendered last year, the ship returned to the country and resumed commercial use to serve the people. The entire crew of the ship is not only chivalrous and admirable, but also made great contributions to maintaining national sovereignty. They are truly the light of Chinese seafarers.</p>

<h3 id="e161">Implementation of Rayon Allocation Measures Starting Today; Reconstruction Textile Company to Re-Allocate Today; Black Market Declines, Speculators Face Doom <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Central Trust Bureau, acting on behalf of the Government Materials and Property Committee, has drafted eleven articles on rayon allocation measures and submitted them to the Bureau Director for approval and implementation. Rayon allocation will commence today, according to these measures. The full text of the articles is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Committee will allocate rayon based on the following priority order, according to supply and demand quantities: (A) Manufacturers for whom rayon is the primary raw material; (B) Manufacturers for whom rayon is an auxiliary raw material; (C) Rayon traders.</p>
<p>(2) Manufacturers applying for rayon allocation must first fill out a registration form with their machinery and equipment, product types, quantities, and current monthly rayon yarn count requirements. This form should be compiled by the respective trade association and submitted to the Committee for allocation approval, followed by periodic allocation.</p>
<p>(3) Traders applying for rayon allocation must fill out a registration form with their business name establishment date, sales location, and sales quantity. This form should be compiled by the trade association and submitted to the Committee for allocation approval, followed by periodic allocation.</p>
<p>(4) All manufacturers and businesses applying for rayon allocation, after the Committee approves their monthly allocation quantity, may purchase the approved quantity in installments or at once, limited to the approved quantity and at the price on the purchase date. If the actual purchase quantity for the month is less than the approved quantity, the remaining amount cannot be carried over to the next month for purchase.</p>
<p>(5) The Committee will allocate rayon provisionally twice a week. Applying manufacturers must fill out a detailed purchase order on the designated application day and submit it to the Committee. After verifying the seal and approving the allocation quantity, the Committee will issue a purchase permit.</p>
<p>(6) Manufacturers purchasing rayon must pay at the Trust Department of the Bureau on the day following the approval of the allocation, based on the purchase permit. On the day following payment, they can exchange the receipt for a bill of lading at the Committee.</p>
<p>(7) All manufacturers purchasing rayon must pick up the goods within seven days from the date the Committee issues the bill of lading. Overdue goods may be re-allocated by the Committee, and the user will be suspended from allocation for one month's worth of demand.</p>
<p>(8) Any user approved for allocation by the Committee who fails to pay according to the prescribed date will be suspended from allocation for one month's worth of demand.</p>
<p>(9) The Committee will post the price of rayon allocation on a public notice board each time an application is made.</p>
<p>(10) If a manufacturer purchasing rayon resells it for profit, their purchase eligibility will be revoked once discovered.</p>
<p>(11) These measures will be implemented upon approval by the Bureau Director.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the Central Trust Bureau determined to allocate rayon today, the silk weaving factory owners of this city decided to bring their seals to their trade association before 10 a.m. today to register the amount of rayon needed for the first period to facilitate the association's compilation and application to the Central Trust Bureau for allocation. It is heard that the Central Trust Bureau will temporarily allocate one-quarter of the monthly actual demand registered by each factory before sending staff to re-examine the registration forms submitted by each factory. In addition, the Hangzhou silk weaving industry's request to register for rayon allocation has also been approved by the Central Trust Bureau. The Central Trust Bureau has agreed to allocate 400 boxes first and hand them over to the Hangzhou branch of the Bureau for allocation.</p>
<p>At the request of the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau, the China Textile Construction Company will re-allocate a batch of rayon today, approximately 300 boxes.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the black market price of rayon had reached the end of its rope. The No. 120 flyover [location reference] had a light that was 100,000 yuan weaker than the previous day, and only one or two boxes were traded. Some speculators planned to hoard and monopolize semi-gloss goods, but real sellers remained calm and did not panic. This plan ultimately failed, so the price of semi-gloss goods also followed suit yesterday and decreased slightly. Due to the scarcity of goods on the market, factory merchants saw a slightly more active transaction yesterday, with each stall up about 50,000 yuan. Silk goods remained stable. Because of the scarcity of goods, Huajin crepe's price showed a slight profit, trading at 3,400 yuan yesterday.</p>

<p>Yesterday, smelted gold was stable with little change, opening at 2.21 million. Resistance was met starting at 2.215 million, with long positions being liquidated one after another, leading to a slight decline. However, there was quite a struggle at the 2.2 million mark. After 10 a.m., the Central Bank distributed 100 bars at a price of 2.195 million, but there was still no special movement. Credit remained tight, and the price once dropped to 2.19 million before noon. It stabilized slightly at noon. In the afternoon, forward contracts rose slightly, rebounding to around 2.205 million. As a result, the closing price was 10,000 lower than the previous day. There were no changes in jewelry gold and refined silver. Silver dollars were also flat. The off-book interest rate initially stabilized and then tightened, with interest rates still ranging from 15% to 18% per month.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies were suppressed by news of the Legislative Yuan's resolution to buy foreign currencies, and demand decreased slightly. Yesterday, the retail market for US dollars was still buying at 3,500 yuan and selling at 3,530 yuan, but there were no transactions. It was reported that asking prices were slightly lower in the gray market, retreating from outside 4,200 yuan to around 4,150 yuan, slightly lower than the previous closing. Affected by the continued rise in Hong Kong-Shanghai telegraphic transfer forward contracts, Hong Kong dollars retreated from 920 yuan to below 880 yuan before stabilizing slightly at the end. As a result, it also fell by ten yuan, with Hong Kong telegraphic transfer at around 890 yuan, Indian remittances at 1,090 to 1,110 yuan, British remittances at around 14,200 yuan, and US exchange rates unchanged. Matching transactions remained quiet.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the supply and demand of government bonds were again balanced. A major account holder on the seventh floor sold bonds on behalf of a money shop, while a bank accounted for 4 million yuan of transactions. The rise and fall were very narrow, merely fluctuating. Unified Class C bonds opened at 1,930 yuan in the morning, rose to 1,970 yuan, fell back to 1,860 yuan midway, and then stabilized, resulting in a gain of 20 yuan for Class A and B bonds compared to the previous closing, a small gain of 30 yuan for Class C bonds, and a decline of 50 yuan for Class D bonds. Unified Class E bonds remained flat.</p>

The Bureau has now agreed with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to establish cotton inspection offices first in six locations: Shanghai, Shaanxi, Hankou, Hebei, Henan, and Nantong. These offices will be jointly operated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, with the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau in charge of the administration of each office.

<p>Since the previous week, asphalt has been weakening daily because new supplies are about to arrive, and holders of goods are eager to sell. However, users also have this in mind to wait for the new supplies, so there has been little change. Recently, after a long period of weakness, it has received little attention, and the situation in Jiangbei has calmed down slightly. Commerce is eagerly awaiting recovery, so those coming to Shanghai to purchase goods have been continuous, and the market has seen a turnaround. Selling prices are also not as accommodating as in the previous two weeks. However, because new supplies are approaching, even if there is a good market, it will be very limited. Sales prices in various sectors have been adjusted. The prices are as follows: Kaihe brand asphalt from Shantou is 135,000 yuan, Intsubo brand asphalt is 125,000 yuan, Ryusaki brand asphalt from Shantou is 120,000 yuan, Dokujo brand asphalt is 116,000 yuan, Soren brand asphalt is 112,000 yuan, ordinary Lan oil is 110,000 yuan, high-grade Kei oil is 120,000 yuan, Tsurumachi oil is 112,000 yuan, and ordinary Machi oil is 108,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Joint Yarn Allocation; Approximately 1,700 Pieces Yesterday <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Yarn Factory Joint Allocation Committee opened yarn sales as usual yesterday afternoon, with privately-owned factories selling 981 pieces and the Textile Construction Company selling 717.5 pieces. The allocation prices remained the same. The Textile Construction Company allocated 20-count Lima yarn to the Dyeing and Weaving Association and the Camel Wool Factory, 32-count Blue Phoenix yarn to the Towel, Handkerchief, and Handicraft Association, 42-count Baoguang yarn to the Dyeing Factory, and 60-count Colorful Ball and 32-count Feng yarn to the Knitting Factory.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Yarn and Cloth Sales Are Sluggish; Market Conditions Are Slightly Weak <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market turned sluggish due to weak sales to customers and apathy among traders. Except for 20-count yarn, which fell back 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, 32-count and finer yarn had risen too much in the previous days, so they fell more than 100,000 yuan. 42-count double-ply yarn was also slow-moving, but it remained firm due to the limited supply.</p>
<p>The cloth market was flat. Fine cloth sales to customers were very scarce due to the lack of colored goods. The buying interest of dyeing factories was also weak, and the situation had not improved. Dragon Head fine cloth was quoted at 87,500 yuan, and Blue Chicken cloth was quoted at 80,000 yuan. However, Four Gentlemen serge was quoted 1,000 yuan higher, and someone raised the price to buy it, increasing it to 2,500 yuan, but it dropped back to 1,000 yuan by the close.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Chinese Stocks Still Show No Improvement; Bearish Sentiment Is Strong <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Chinese stocks continued on their old path, with high prices unable to sustain themselves and trading becoming even more sluggish. In the early morning, the opening prices of various stocks showed some improvement, and there were continued gains after the opening, but this was short-lived, and they successively declined. As a result, people became pessimistic again. Despite some purchases from banks, the two major sectors succumbed to bearish pressure and were unable to rise. Although there were some small rebounds midway, they were ultimately overwhelmed by selling pressure. Long positions were cut and sold off one after another, causing prices to decline. A temporary pause was reached after 11:40 AM. Near noon, short covering slightly increased, and some arbitrageurs came to buy. The noon close was weak but slightly stable. Compared to the previous close, except for Xinhe, Jinglun, Xinya, China Silk, Huafeng, and Wuhe, which remained flat, all other stocks declined. The market slightly rose in the afternoon, but it was sold off by arbitrageurs, and soon the decline resumed. However, there were many buyers at lower prices, and prices slightly stabilized again near the close. Compared to the previous close, Yongsheng Yarn, Meyer, Lianan, Cement, and Jinglun Company declined only slightly. Datong Underwear and Tongyi each fell by half a percent, while Huafeng, Wuhe, and Heping remained flat. The trading volume was 8.1 million shares in the morning market and only 1.8 million shares in the afternoon market. The over-the-counter stocks were stable only in Zhabei, while the declines in other sectors did not stop.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks continued to be depressed. Except for Yeguang, which remained flat, all other stocks declined again. Smaller stocks were even more sluggish. Compared to the previous close, Yeguang and Navigation remained flat, Yisha and British Union Paper slightly declined, and Yipi and Wheelock Marden fell by about half a percent.</p>
<h3 id="e176">US to Gradually Lift Price Controls; Rent and Sugar Are the Only Exceptions <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 15th] A senior official of the US Price Administration anticipates that all government price controls will effectively end by or after Christmas. The first to be decontrolled will be food. The first batch will likely include bread, flour, biscuits, macaroni, tea, cocoa, whiskey, and most canned foods and fruits. Items scheduled for later decontrol include household consumer goods such as radios, irons, vacuum cleaners, gas appliances, and water heaters. The last to be decontrolled will be steel and steel products, railroad cars, newsprint, textiles, and similar goods. Most Price Administration officials admit that most price ceilings will be removed within two months, but rent and sugar are important exceptions.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Industrial Decline; Few Raw Material Orders <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>A certain raw material importer in this city said that due to delayed lead times and extraordinarily high interest burdens, traders have suffered huge losses in terms of ordering. Since August, there have been no large orders, and at present, there are virtually none. The raw material trade has also been very weak recently. The reason is the decline of domestic industry. The outlet for raw materials lies in factories. When factories shut down, raw material transactions naturally become sluggish. Traders who hold goods, although there are many popular goods, most are bought and sold quickly because they are easier to sell. There are also quite a few unpopular goods. Some unpopular goods have no sales outlets at all, resulting in high storage costs and unbearable interest burdens. Moreover, operating with popular goods is not easy. Often, once sold, it is impossible to replenish the current goods. Therefore, the more real sales decrease, the less the business is done. Therefore, the raw material trade will not be easy to prosper until there is hope for the revival of domestic industry.</p>

<p>The trend of woolen fabrics was mostly firm yesterday, but the prices of most American goods have implicitly weakened because of the impact of the large influx of South African woolen fabrics at the beginning of the week. The total amount of these goods is 6,000 tons, of which floral fabrics account for more than a dozen colors. Large wholesalers in Chessboard Street have successively offered goods for sale, so the prices of goods of equal quality from local factories have been dragged down. However, the prices of British goods have not changed because their quality is different.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Printing and Dyeing Factories Are Busy; Orders Reach as Far as November; Serge and Indigo Cloth Are Popular and Selling Well; Still Depends on Whether Raw Materials and Dyes Are Sufficient <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] After struggling to survive in the shadow of a recession, the printing and dyeing factories in this city have now shown a glimmer of hope. Yesterday, a magnate in the printing and dyeing industry told a reporter: "The recent turnaround in the printing and dyeing industry is purely due to the popularity of printed serge and indigo cloth. The sales of these fabrics are mostly concentrated in this city. Since the wages and allowances of the city's laboring masses have been adjusted monthly according to the cost of living index, incomes have generally increased, and purchasing power is also stronger. Now that it is autumn and winter, the sales of fabrics have been smooth. The market prices of various fabrics in Tianjin, Beiping, Hankou, and other places are similar to those in this city, and there is often a price reversal situation. Therefore, export sales are not as smooth as those in this city. As for the current printing and dyeing industry, profitability depends on whether the raw materials and dyes are sufficient. There are many varieties of dyes, and prices have risen by 100% after the exchange rate adjustment. However, the allocation of goods from Dextro is still insufficient. However, printing is still more profitable than dyeing. Taking printed serge as an example, the base fabric costs 60,000 yuan per bolt, and after printing and dyeing, it can be sold for 100,000 yuan, with a net profit of 10,000 yuan per bolt. Dyeing, for example, using 190 indigo cloth, the raw material used is ordinary medium-grade fine cloth, costing 80,000 yuan per bolt, and after dyeing, it can be sold for 130,000 yuan. However, with indigo dye alone, each bolt already costs more than 25,000 yuan. Therefore, after adding processing fees, interest, and losses, there is no profit to be made. It is now heard that the goods from various large and small printing and dyeing factories in the city are mostly in short supply. The orders for one factory have reached as far as November. However, the common threats to industry today, such as high wages, high interest rates, and miscellaneous taxes, are not exceptions in this industry. These people believe that the most important plan for the printing and dyeing industry at present is to seize the current opportunity to turn the tide, consolidate the foundation as much as possible, expand the scale, and increase production, so that the production costs of each unit can be proportionally reduced, so that the lower the selling price, the smoother the sales, and from this city to foreign ports, expanding to Southeast Asia, then the printing and dyeing industry has an optimistic future."</p>

Currently, the Taiwan National Language Association is designing various methods based on the actual situation, paying particular attention to teacher training to ensure suitability. After the report, the meeting discussed proposals: Regarding teacher training, it was decided to request the Ministry of Education to establish a national language teacher training institute in Beijing to recruit students who can speak standard national language and provide them with several months of training in phonetics and teaching techniques, which will be sent by the Ministry to various provinces and cities to promote the national language.</p>

<h3 id="e206">Jinda Professor Dismissal Issue Resolved Satisfactorily by Ministry of Education Official; Couple Teaching at the Same School Resolved at the Same Time <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>The National Jinan University experienced a major uproar due to President Li Shouyong's unwarranted dismissal of returning professors. The Ministry of Education sent an official to Shanghai to handle the matter, which was resolved satisfactorily. The school authorities have admitted that the unwarranted dismissal of professors was a mistake. However, new professors have already been hired, making it difficult to advance or retreat. As for the dismissed professors, most have received offers from other universities or colleges. The reason they have been insisting on the matter is that the school authorities' actions are unreasonable, and they must argue on principle to protect the rights and interests of the professors. Therefore, after mediation by Tong Dakun, a supervisor from the Ministry of Education, the matter was settled. The aftermath measures have been agreed upon by both sides: (1) The school authorities will rehire five professors. The professor representatives will first submit a list of twelve names, and then the school authorities will select and hire them according to the needs of each department. Currently, Ye Zuozhou and Ke Pengzhou have been hired as professors in the School of Commerce. Huang Yuanfang has been hired as a professor in the School of Science. Wang Zhiheng has been hired as a professor in the School of Literature. Chen Wenbin has been hired as a professor in the School of Law.</p>
<p>Professor Shen Lianzhi to be Invited Back to the School</p>
<p>(2) All the professors who were hired by Yingshi University before, with Shen Lianzhi as the dean of the School of Literature, and later transferred to the position of dean of academic affairs, and even acting president, are still being hired this semester, which is very dissatisfied. They firmly demand that Shen be invited back to teach at the school. However, the school authorities and the Ministry of Education supervisor believe that Shen is currently the dean of academic affairs at National Yingshi University, and it is difficult for him to leave Zhejiang. Therefore, they plan to first seek the opinion of the Yingshi University authorities in Zhejiang. If they agree, they will continue to hire him. (3) The school authorities have agreed to pay compensation to the dismissed professors. Those who came to Shanghai with the school and were dismissed will receive an amount equal to four months of salary, and those who did not come to Shanghai with the school will receive an amount equal to two months of salary, both calculated according to the standards of July this year. Most of the professors have left Shanghai one after another to teach at other schools. In addition, all the dismissed professors express their gratitude to the colleagues from various newspapers and news agencies in this city for speaking up for justice and calling for attention, which enabled the government to pay attention and resolve the matter satisfactorily. They have sent letters to express their thanks.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wang Xiunan to Take on a New Position</p>
<p>[Additional Report] The dismissal of Professor Wang Xiunan's wife by Li Shouyong, President of National Jinan University, on the grounds that couples cannot serve in the same school, has also attracted attention, just like the unwarranted dismissal of returning professors. After the case occurred, Wang telegraphed Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education for instructions, but he himself predicted that the Ministry of Education authorities would be difficult to answer. When the Ministry of Education supervisor came to the school to mediate the dismissal of professors this time, he stated that although the Ministry of Education did not have regulations on this, there were still schools with such special precedents and mediated from the middle. The reporter met Professor Wang Xiunan yesterday, who said: "Regarding whether couples can serve in the same school, the Ministry of Education has not yet issued instructions. However, my wife's matter has been resolved at the same time as the other forty-odd professors who were not rehired. I will still be the professor at Jinan University. My wife will change to an associate professor at the National Youyi Kindergarten Normal College."</p>

<h3 id="e208">The Case of Li Rui and the 50,000 Piculs of Military Grain <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Changsha Dispatch, September 23rd, by Huang Chao-ru</p>
<p>There, upon leaving office, accused of corruption, the trial is not yet concluded;</p>
<p>Here, taking over the position, acting suspiciously, many problems arise.</p>
<p>This year, the most sensational news in Changsha, besides the lawsuit against the outgoing Director of Finance and concurrently Director of the Provincial Land and Grain Office, Hu Mai, for corruption, is the "Case of Li Rui and the 50,000 Piculs of Military Grain." Currently, Hu Mai's corruption case is still under trial. The current Director of Finance and concurrently Director of the Provincial Land and Grain Office, Li Rui, is the one who took over Hu Mai's seat. Logically, with the example of the past, even with Hu Mai's meticulousness, he still inevitably ended up in jail, facing imprisonment. One would think he should do a good job, but unexpectedly, another sensational "50,000 Piculs of Military Grain" case has occurred.</p>
<p>Senators Raise Questions, Land and Grain Office Releases News</p>
<p>This case was brought up by the Provincial Senate for questioning. After several twists and turns, although it has not yet reached the stage of confirming that the Land and Grain Office has committed any fraud, the facts are already clearly laid out, and there is no way to cover them up.</p>
<p>The process of this case is roughly as follows: After the Provincial Land and Grain Office ordered the cessation of grain purchases from various counties at the end of June this year, from July to September, more than 70,000 bags of grain were needed, equivalent to more than 190,000 piculs of grain, which needed to be purchased separately for allocation. Furthermore, before the end of May, there was a widespread grain shortage in various counties, making it difficult to collect the allocated grain, resulting in an accumulation of more than 80,000 bags of military grain in arrears. Additionally, in accordance with the telegram from the Chief of the General Staff, 11,000 large bags of garrison grain were to be raised in Changsha and other places. In order to pre-arrange the grain source so that the military grain could be supplied continuously, without interruption, in addition to expediting the transport of grain from Jiangxi for replenishment, a portion was also purchased. It was entrusted to the Central Plains Company, a Republic of China university student management office, each to purchase 10,000 piculs of grain, and the Hunan Supply Bureau was entrusted to issue 30,000 piculs of grain in lieu of payment to the troops (if physical grain was needed, the bureau would purchase it on its behalf). The above totaled 50,000 piculs. The total grain was priced at 13,500 yuan per picul, according to the price approved by the central government, with the delivery location in Changsha.</p>
<p>On the surface, there is nothing wrong with the above situation. What is especially trustworthy is that at that time, the price of rice in Changsha was higher than the price of the purchased grain. Who could deny that our Director Li attached importance to public funds, ensuring that the public did not suffer losses? However, upon closer examination, the matter is quite different, and there are still many suspicious points.</p>
<p>After this matter was brought up for questioning by the Provincial Senate, the Land and Grain Office, in addition to replying to the Senate, also issued a long press release explaining the process of ordering grain, with the emphasis still being that the price of the ordered grain was lower than the price of rice in Changsha at the time, to demonstrate that there was no wrongdoing and the painstaking effort to save public funds.</p>
<p>Dissatisfied with the Reply, A Second Inquiry is Proposed</p>
<p>Subsequently, the Provincial Senate did not consider the "reply satisfactory." At the 20th meeting of the resident committee, a second inquiry was proposed:</p>
<p>"First, regarding the grain price issue, the grain price mentioned in the document is the market price in Changsha, but the grain purchase location is actually in the grain-producing area around the lake. What was the actual grain price around the lake from the time of the contract to the time of delivery?</p>
<p>Second, was all the purchased grain transported to Changsha for delivery? If it was indeed all transported to Changsha for delivery, what were the required transportation costs?</p>
<p>Third, when the contract for purchasing grain was signed, the autumn harvest was approaching. Grain prices were expected to fall. Did the grain administration authorities pay attention to this fact?</p>
<p>Fourth, the Central Plains Company, the Republic of China University, and the Hunan Supply Bureau are not grain merchants. Since they did not go through bidding procedures, nor were they specially designated by the Ministry of Grain, why were they exclusively entrusted with purchasing on behalf of the authorities?"</p>
<p>Speaking from conscience, these four questions raised by the Provincial Senate are not deliberately making trouble or intentionally finding fault; they are the doubts of common sense that everyone shares. The most important key point in these four questions is, "When the contract for purchasing grain was signed, the autumn harvest was approaching. Grain prices were expected to fall..." As the Director of the Land and Grain Office, in charge of the grain administration of a province, did he not have this much observational ability? It was clear that grain prices would fall sharply in another ten or fifteen days, but the Land and Grain Office insisted on seizing these ten or fifteen days to entrust non-grain merchants to purchase on its behalf, resulting in a loss of more than 5,000 yuan per picul (in early September, the price of grain in Changsha fell to 8,000 or 9,000 yuan per picul, and the price of rice around the lake was even lower). What kind of medicine is Director Li selling in his gourd? A discerning person can guess a thing or two without detailed investigation.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the "50,000 Piculs of Military Grain" case has attracted attention, but the most puzzling thing is that while Hu Mai's corruption case is still under trial, this Director Li, sitting in Hu Mai's seat, openly dares to do such sneaky deeds, which cannot help but make people admire his boldness.</p>
<p>Every day, bandits are executed by firing squad, and every day, robberies occur. Are these people really unafraid of the law? Being driven by livelihood is still excusable! While corruption is being punished on one side, corrupt practices are being carried out on the other side. How can this be justified? In this "50,000 Piculs of Military Grain" case, whether Director Li has any improper intentions is being closely watched by all parties, and perhaps the truth will come to light soon.</p>
<h3 id="e209">A Glimpse of Changsha <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Changsha Dispatch, 5th, by our correspondent Gao Yuan-li</p>
<p>The heat has passed, autumn is coming, and the leaves are falling from yellow to withered. Various social phenomena are also like this. Several notable corruption allegations have been exposed one after another, following several meetings. They are truly like autumn leaves, withering and falling in the wind, with nowhere to hide.</p>
<p>Li Rui's Military Grain Issue Creates a Great Stir</p>
<p>The most intense and attention-grabbing issue in Changsha is still the grain case. The Provincial Senate held a meeting for this case, inviting senators stationed in the province to hold a discussion with the Director of the Land and Grain Office, Li Rui, and the Director of the Supply Bureau, Zhou He-ting, to explain the situation. However, more than a month has passed, and there is still no concrete solution, and it will probably end without resolution. The whole case is as follows: In July, when the autumn harvest was approaching, the Provincial Land and Grain Office, in order to compensate for the military's grain arrears, entrusted the Central Plains Company, the Production and Management Office of the Republic of China University, and the Hunan Supply Bureau to purchase 50,000 piculs of military grain at a legal price of 13,500 yuan per picul. The Central Plains Company and the Republic of China University each undertook to purchase 10,000 piculs, and the Supply Bureau undertook to purchase 30,000 piculs. In fact, at that time, because the autumn harvest was approaching, grain prices fell sharply, and the market price in Changsha was no more than 6,800 yuan per picul, resulting in huge losses to the public for no reason. The senators were greatly alarmed. When convening a discussion meeting with senators stationed in the province, they fiercely criticized Li Rui, the concurrent Director of the Land and Grain Office, believing that these three institutions were not grain merchants and were using their positions to compete with the people for profit. The person in charge of the Central Plains Company was Senator Chen Yun-zhang, and the Production and Management Office of the Republic of China University was headed by Lu Dang-ping, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee. Moreover, the matter was not approved by the Military Grain Procurement Committee in advance, nor was the public informed, nor was it subjected to a voting procedure. The measures were improper, and they should be held administratively responsible. When answering the senators' questions, Li Rui repeatedly stated that Chen Yun-zhang and others had been pestering him for a long time, and he could not get rid of them, so he had to allow them to undertake the purchase of 10,000 piculs. At that time, Senator Chen Yun-zhang went to Shanghai for business, so his response was not heard at the meeting. As for Lu Dang-ping, he sent a private letter to Speaker Zhao Yan-wu, explaining the difficulties of running the Republic of China University, saying that during the War of Resistance, the university moved four times and suffered heavy losses. After the victory, it was difficult to resume operations, so they had to become self-reliant and seek small profits to supplement the school's expenses. This purchase of military grain was definitely not for personal gain. (According to reports, the Production and Management Office of the Republic of China University has a machine sawmill and a rice mill in Changsha.) In the end, the plenary session decided that the provincial government should be responsible for compensating for the losses, and if the purchasers had any illegal profits, they should also be recovered. This matter came to an end from the perspective of the Provincial Senate, but when the Changsha County Senate held a meeting, the old case was brought up again, and a telegram was sent to the Provincial Senate requesting that personnel be dispatched to thoroughly investigate the matter, and that the Supervisory Yuan be requested to punish both the giver and the receiver according to law, and a telegram was sent to the senates of various counties and cities to respond in unison, so the case has the potential to expand.</p>

<p>The Provincial Congress Results in Clichés</p>
<p>After the Second Administrative Conference of the Changsha-Nanyue District convened by the Hunan Provincial Government ended, the Fifth Hunan Provincial Congress of the Kuomintang Party Headquarters was held in Changsha. The results of the meeting can be said to be clichés, all about proposals for improving party affairs, politics, and the economy, a grand spectacle. The most eye-catching was the election of executive and supervisory committee members. Many people participated in the election, including leaders from all walks of life. Ou Bing-kun, the chairman of the Hengyang City Chamber of Commerce, also came to Changsha specifically to participate in the election. The Provincial Federation of Commerce and the Changsha City Chamber of Commerce provided strong support for him. Their reason was based on vocational groups, believing that the business community should have someone participate in the work of the party. On the day before the election, the City Chamber of Commerce hosted a gathering of all the delegates and the election supervisor, Lai Lian, at the YMCA. Most of the delegates expressed their approval at the meeting, but in the end, Ou Bing-kun was still defeated. According to sources, Ou's election campaign started too late, which was probably one of the reasons.</p>
<p>The Farewell Words of the Investigation Team: Regret for Not Having a Supreme Sword</p>
<p>Around the time of the Fifth National Congress, the Enemy and Puppet Materials Receiving and Investigation Team, led by Mr. Qiu Yi-shan, came to Changsha to work. The materials received in Changsha were mostly from the enemy and less from the puppets. However, the materials received from the enemy were in the hands of the military, specifically the Fourth War Area at the time. The area had already left Hunan and been transferred away. Only Shen Da-ke, the representative of the former Wartime Transportation Bureau, who received the vehicles from the Fourth War Area, could be found. According to Shen's report, all the vehicles he received were already damaged, but the original inventory list could not be found. When a telegram was sent to Wang Yao-wu, the former commander of the Fourth War Area, to inquire, no leads could be found either. However, the results of the investigation proved that Shen did have some "problems." The total number of vehicles originally handed over by the enemy was fifty or sixty, and at least half of them were in good condition, but according to the reports of the various vehicle distribution agencies, they had not received a single fully functional vehicle, which was a strange thing. The investigation team did not stay in Changsha for long, only transferring Shen's case to the local court for investigation. The local court has investigated several times, and it is said that more than a hundred people are involved. The date of filing a public prosecution is still far away. Regarding other investigation cases, the investigation team did not make any announcements. Mr. Qiu Yi-shan said to people temporarily, "It's a pity that we don't have a supreme sword." The implication is naturally that there are some concerns.</p>
<p>50 Million in Pensions, A Cause for Both Tears and Laughter</p>
<p>The case of Huang Li-shuang, Director of the Hunan Postal Administration, and Liu Si-cheng, Director of the Hunan Branch of the Pension Committee, being impeached, also caused a sensation in Changsha. The Pension Committee sent 50 million yuan in pensions to the Hunan Branch, but the Hunan Branch was unaware of this for several months. When the post office received the remittance, it was listed under the category of negotiated loans. Both parties muddled through for several months. The administrative efficiency was so low that it was a cause for both tears and laughter. This case is also under investigation by the local procuratorate.</p>
<h3 id="e210">A Record of Gold Panning in the Jiufen Gold Mining Area <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Taipei Airmail Dispatch, 3rd, by our correspondent Jiang Mu-yun</p>
<p>Government employees who come to Taiwan are often wished "good luck in panning for gold." This expression contains a degree of commercial irony. In reality, the island of Taiwan is indeed a "golden country."</p>
<p>Geologists and industrial researchers say that the gold content of this province is quite high. The mines with mining value include Jiufen and Ruifang in the north, as well as Baojinpu in Keelung, the Xiuguluan River basin in Hualien Port, and Fenglin Ruishui Village, Xinxing Port in Taitung, and other places. In particular, the Jiufen mine produces gold, silver, copper, and iron sulfide. The mining area covers 18,325,594 square feet. If refining is completed, it can produce a total of 500 catties of gold per year, equivalent to 800 large bars.</p>
<p>The reporter ventured into the mining area under the summer heat a few days ago. The reporter did not intend to pan for gold, but attempted to conduct an on-site investigation in one day. In Taiwan, people also like to use gold as ornaments. They even have a saying: "As long as there is gold to be had, even life is disregarded." However, another saying negates this: "The mouth of Keelung harbor has stone sailboats; no matter how much gold you earn, you will not benefit." This explains that the gold miners are not the owners of the wealth, but the institution that controls the gold panning is the owner of the gold. The customs and people of the island are the same as those in the mainland. And now, the words floating on the lips of government employees in the mainland are: "The water in Keelung is salty, the water in the Yangtze River is sweet." They all want to buy a boat and return home.</p>
<p>(1) Going to the Mining Area</p>
<p>To get to the Jiufen mining area, there is only one road perched on the top of Sandiaoling. This road enters the mountains as soon as it leaves Keelung City. The car body revolves in the valley. This is the coal mining area. Hundreds of thousands of tons of second-class coal are piled up at the pit entrance, and some of it is still self-combusting in the rain. The fare for the bus from Keelung to Jiufen was originally only a few cents, but now it has risen to thirty yuan. This amount is alarming to the locals. The first large station is Ruifang, which is halfway to the mining area. Because it is close to Nuannuan, which is famous for its rainfall all over the world, the weather was clear in Keelung, but it was raining heavily in Ruifang. The weather and geography are obviously different from the plains. In the section of the road that the reporter passed from Ruifang to Jiufen, the body was like squatting in a violently vibrating airplane, the head was a little dizzy, and the reporter was floating. Looking down outside the window, the peaks were no longer visible, and there was only a road passing over the green hillside, drawing a meandering curve like a sheep intestine. The vast face of the Pacific Ocean was far away, and the boundary between the horizon and the sea waves could not be distinguished. After two hours, we stopped on a hillside built with cement. The driver wiped his sweat and said happily that we had reached the destination.</p>
<p>(2) Bird's-eye View of the Slope</p>
<p>Following the cement stone steps, we walked up the mountain. On both sides were neat, purely Japanese-style wooden bungalows. There was a silence. The person leading the reporter on the tour said that this place used to be full of Japanese technicians. They have all been sent back to their country in the spring. Because there is no one to take over, they are still vacant. We took a bird's-eye view on a slope on the top of the mountain and could clearly see the undulating houses, temples, elementary schools, and destroyed refineries built along the mountain. Iron water pipes are connected along the road. The ones used by the people are now changed to temporary measures with bamboo poles that follow the water. Taking a short rest in this desolate mountain village, I felt a bit of pressure on my heart. The hard-working spirit of the Japanese is admired, but they are willing to work in this coastal wilderness and never tire of it, even though they are aggressive and exploitative.</p>
<p>The reporter walked with his back bent on the path, heading towards the mountainside. A group of unkempt and wild workers walked towards us, casting strange glances at us. We looked him up and down: a set of ragged clothes covered in yellow mud, a pale complexion, skin lacking nutrition, long black beard setting off black eyes, his face was pitiful but also terrifying. His only tools were an iron pick, a hammer, and a carbide lamp. But he revealed a kind tone to us and said that it would take about twenty minutes to get to the mining area, but you can dig for gold on the whole mountain, the fear is that there may not be any. We looked down and saw three or five people in the canyon of yellow sand dunes, holding large sieves, pouring mud into them, and pouring it onto the ground after sieving. Looking ahead, two workers were sitting on stones resting, and another was squatting by the stream, using an iron spoon to mix the yellow sand with water, and then grinding the sand with a small iron hammer, once, twice, countless times. In the end, he said softly to his companion, "Nothing." When we asked him how many workers there were here, he almost revealed his miserable situation: "There is no other business to do, so I have to come to the mountains to pan for gold, but there is no way, and I really cannot have great hope. The government has come to inspect this place. When will work start, I don't know when. Now everyone is doing their own thing, but most of the gold they pan cannot support themselves!"</p>
<p>(3) The Pit Entrance Has Collapsed</p>
<p>The reporter tried his best to climb towards the top of the mountain, because the road was made of rubble and had not been repaired for many years, it was not easy to walk. With great difficulty, he climbed to a place with two or three houses. The houses were covered with reeds, only one side was sheltered from the wind. One was selling snacks and tea, one was a "rest room" where a few workers were lying down, and there were several workers panning for sand gold in one of the rooms. Three men leaned on wooden sticks and used their feet to grind the sand back and forth in the iron trough. After this procedure, the sand was moved into a roughly made wooden trough like a large duckbill. Skilled workers deftly tossed the wooden trough with both hands, and of course water was added at this time, and the yellow floating mud was thrown away again and again, leaving a layer of light blue or gray sediment; then, the gold content was selected by manual analysis. This primitive manual gold panning method forces some coolies to work day and night in order to live, and at the same time makes the wealthy in the free gold digging business richer and the poor poorer. This place is completely like an unexplored virgin land. As long as there is capital, you can recruit workers on a small scale to dig in the mountains. It is said that there used to be hundreds of them, but now there are few left! Standing above is the mountain peak that has been eroded of its youthful years. A worker pointed and told us that this is the main peak. Like here, people are helplessly searching for the dream of gold. After a while, he turned to us again and said, "Look, the back is the former pit entrance. The Japanese used to repair it at any time, but now it has collapsed!" Then he said sadly, "The whole mountain has been dug with dozens of deep pits. People are afraid that one day a great tragedy of collapse will occur!"</p>
<p>(4) How to Pan for Gold</p>
<p>This place was originally the Jiufen Mine of the Japanese Mining Co., Ltd. It is now under the jurisdiction of the Taiwan Copper Mine Preparation Office of the Resources Committee. According to the person in charge, the mine was in its heyday from the 10th to the 13th year of the Republic (1921-1924), and the highest production volume in the 25th year of the Republic (1936) was sent to the Saga 関 Refinery in Japan, which smelted 2,603 kilograms and 6,954 metric tons of copper. The gold mine stopped working in March of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), and could produce 215 tons per year. The copper mine was also shut down in March of last year. The office is currently actively repairing the mining tunnels and mineral processing equipment, and collecting mine water precipitation. Several plans have been drawn up, but due to lack of funds, it is now planned to start small-scale gold ore mining and mineral separation and copper production from precipitated mine water. In addition to the current sorting and repair of mining equipment, the new smelter and by-product sulfuric acid plant will have to wait for cooperation with the Canadian Novanda Copper Company and successful business negotiations before it can be realized. The company is currently sending experts to the mine for inspection. However, he frankly told the reporter that after years of mining by the Japanese, most of the rich mines have been dug up, and the current reserves are only enough to meet our country's consumption for a few years. The mine is large in scale, and the mine has a mineral processing plant and cyanide plant equipment that can process 2,500 metric tons of ore per day, but it has been in disrepair for many years and cannot be produced without large-scale repairs for about a year.</p>
<p>There are 900 miners inside and outside the mine. They have hospitals and cinemas, and thousands of people live directly and indirectly on them, which is incomparable to the peak period when tens of thousands of workers were employed, so the severity of the unemployment problem has forced them to spontaneously dig for sand gold!</p>
<p>Do you want to come to Taiwan to "pan for gold"? The island has a lot of gold, and it is said that the production area in the aboriginal area of Hualien Port is even more abundant, but no one can muster the courage to come. The gold that the Japanese dug in Taiwan was sent to Japan for refining. Japan never regarded Taiwan as a purely industrialized zone, and fully produced its products through the means of production. Therefore, to complete this high degree of industrialization, it is necessary to allocate the largest amount of capital and technology, but this is at least impossible in the short term. After staying in the mining area for an hour, when I hurried back from Jiufen, the reporter's confidence was strengthened.</p>

<h3 id="e211">Eight-Gui Youths Fear Not Loneliness <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 2nd of the Month, Guilin Airmail News, Our Reporter Liang Xiaozhong</p>
<p>As the harsh season begins, one might occasionally, under the solitary lamp of a cool night, softly read a verse from Du Fu's "The Officer at Stone Moat," solemnly recite "Ballad of the War Wagons." It seems as if the suffering eyes of millions from the Middle Ages are once again watching us, the people of today, smiling bleakly, weeping with quiet resentment. As October begins, when the reeds turn white and the swallows and geese disappear, the grain bureaus of every county and city joyfully celebrate their grand opening. The collection of grains, actual goods, and surtaxes begins punctually. The deadline is the end of December for everything to be completed. In normal times, paying grain and taxes is a more mundane task than farming in the eyes of the common people. However, alas, a vast land plagued by drought, floods, wind, and pests has resulted in an unprecedented famine. Grain levies, however, are like sharp arrows piercing the eyes of those still carrying hope. Listen to the two lines of a popular song in northern Guangxi, filled with tears: they sing in low voices, "Having put down the sickle, there's not a grain of rice; the common people are Tang Sanzang's flesh." Where is the Western Paradise for this group of emaciated Tang Sanzangs? This time last year, the terror of hunger and death loomed over the entire province of Guangxi. Helpless tenant farmers, struggling to escape the clutches of death, hardened their hearts and went to "sell the green crops," borrowing just enough money from landlords and ruthless usurers to stay alive. For example, borrowing 20,000 yuan at that time could buy at most a little over 20 jin of rice. But this autumn, they must repay 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, while the price of rice has plummeted to a miserable 20,000 yuan per dan, making those exploited unable to even cry. Over 20 jin of rice must be repaid with two dan of rice! What kind of world is this? Everyone understands that cheap grain hurts farmers, but who can truly understand the pain of "having put down the sickle, there's not a grain of rice"? Moreover, there are still annual grain levies to pay, and failure to pay by the end of the year will result in "officials arresting people at night"? The remission of last year's land tax entirely benefited the landlords. This year, reducing rent by 25% is the focus of Guangxi's administration. The government has attempted to redistribute some of the benefits of the land tax exemption from the landlords to the tenant farmers, while also earnestly carrying out rent reduction work. However, due to the pervasive influence of evil forces and the ignorance of tenant farmers, the rent reduction measures have encountered unprecedented difficulties. Under the high-pressure persecution, tenant farmers remain on the brink of death, heavily exploited for their blood and sweat. Who will truly face this bloody reality, this ugly and ferocious state of affairs! The deep-seated pain of the past two years is a dream in the hearts of the farmers…</p>
<p>Conscription, just like taxation, is the people's supreme duty. Therefore, after the establishment of two military districts throughout the four million-plus dead in eastern, western, southern and northern Guangxi, the conscription work is slowly spreading like a wave in all directions as a result of the one time investigation into the families of the conscripted. After the autumn harvest, the barren years force farmers to busy themselves with planning the winter planting. In their hearts, besides a plow, a rifle faintly appears, vaguely imagining yet another unknown war. Although the conscription quota has not yet been officially announced, judging from the recent situation where the Provincial Security Headquarters was ordered to transfer one-third of the active-duty soldiers (Security Regiments) to Wuhan for training, and the number of officers and members of the 10th Army Officer Training Corps borrowed from various military districts, it is believed that the number will be quite considerable in the future. The Eight-Gui youths, shouldering a rifle, are valiant fighters. It is hoped that the muzzle of this rifle will forever point towards the sky, or at the enemies of the nation.</p>
<p>So many troubles bring people into a helpless world. Here, I tell the dear readers about three unemployed groups in Guilin, and from this desolate corner, we can see the entire current situation of China. Perhaps this will not be a meaningless thing. First, the provincial-level organs are implementing layoffs starting this month. One-third of the civil servants face a dark road ahead. Those who believe they "have a good chance of being laid off" are desperately trying to network and find a way out, but in the end, they are mostly burned out, preparing to sing of returning home. However, those who are cunning and know how to please their superiors have their own tricks. Director ×× received two boxes of mooncakes during the Mid-Autumn Festival, and when opened, they were full of golden gold. After hearing this, I am really worried that this old man was careless at the time and swallowed the mooncakes whole without even opening them, resulting in a painless death. What a set of officialdom revelations!</p>
<p>This year's graduates of Guangxi University are like the late-harvested rice in their hometown, delayed in their graduation time due to a relocation storm to Wuzhou, suffering a great loss. In a society that is scrambling for jobs, the bachelors of various universities who graduated a month earlier have already gained the upper hand. By the time the graduates of Guangxi University registered and applied to the Ministry of Education, it was already "too late." One letter was from the Ministry of National Defense saying "waiting for assignment," another was from the Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office saying "deep regret." They are indeed a little lost. Less than one-tenth of them can be sure of finding a job. Those who studied engineering still have some places to go, but those who studied political economy are crying out in despair. During the graduation ceremony, the representative sent by the provincial government repeatedly expressed the hope that the students would serve their hometowns. But when the students really wanted to serve their hometowns, it was another "registration for selection and waiting for use." What bitter university students! Where does talent come from?</p>
<p>The pampered university students are distressed, and the rickshaw pullers who sell their labor are also distressed. The rickshaws in Guilin have wooden wheels, and walking on the broken roads is like riding in a bullock cart. However, in order to maintain the call for humanity, the authorities have also decided to eliminate these 300-plus bullock carts within a limited time. The rickshaw pullers are red-eyed, shouting, "Get rid of more inhumane things before you get rid of us!" Occasionally, when talking to the rickshaw pullers about this matter, most of them have a sense of "living or dying with their broken carts." Originally, in Chinese society, inhumane things are more than just pulling rickshaws. Welfare work has not been done, but they first boast about benevolence and righteousness. How can people stand it?</p>
<p>The labor problem, when it involved the gateway to eastern Guangxi – Wuzhou, there was a not so small disturbance. There are good and bad ways to sell one's labor. Originally, there was a stevedore group within the Wuzhou Seamen's Union, which was an ugly dark secret.</p>
<p>For the past eight years, they have extorted fees from passing ships for commercial goods, amassing countless wealth. Until September of this year, they became increasingly fierce, even arbitrarily manipulating the cargo transportation of ships traveling between Guangdong and Guangxi. The merchants could no longer tolerate it and collectively petitioned the provincial government, recounting the dark secrets of the stevedore group. As a result, the stevedore group was ordered to disband by the provincial government. Unexpectedly, the workers, incited by dissidents, actually forcibly occupied the docks and intensified their actions, leading to the interruption of shipping between Guangdong and Guangxi for a time. The situation was serious. It was not until recently, after the Guangxi Provincial Government prepared to take active measures, that they scattered like a swarm of bees. This stage was brewing a major seamen's strike, but in the end, everything quietly dissipated again.</p>
<p>The roar of the overnight gale pushed Guilin into the gates of early winter. The midnight cries of the refugees who had survived a hundred calamities can be heard every night. The measures for winter relief are still a mystery, a mystery that I am no longer willing to guess.</p>
<p>Terrible addiction once again adorns this diseased mountain city. Everything is so impoverished. The reporter had a severe addiction that almost cost him his life, but he was fortunate enough to have injections of Pukang Mother Star available and recovered his health. However, some hospitals in northern Guangxi can only break a quinine pill into four pieces and distribute them to four patients, which is both absurd and tragic to talk about.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Chairman Huang returned from Shanghai and, in addition to lamenting that "sesame cakes are more expensive than bread, boiled water is more expensive than kerosene, and tea is more expensive than coffee" in Shanghai, he also compared Guangxi with another province, expressing infinite comfort. Chairman Huang admitted that Guangxi is lonely, but the construction work can still be done by "doing whatever comes to mind." Besides the terrible separation between the central and local governments, there is a bright road ahead. The Eight-Gui youths are not afraid of loneliness, and what the people of Guangxi need is real comfort… (Sent on October 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e212">A Glimpse of the Street Stalls <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 11th of the Month, Chongqing Airmail News, Our Correspondent in Chongqing, Wang Boxiang</p>
<p>Crowded and Lively</p>
<p>The street stalls in Chongqing, filling the streets and alleys, are a new business that has emerged since the victory. From the outside, the street stalls in Chongqing are no different from those in other places, but in terms of their development process, the street stalls in Chongqing are "ahead of the curve." Even with the return of various central ministries and commissions to the capital and the return of thousands of residents to their eastern hometowns, this prosperous and splendid capital has been able to maintain its bustling phenomenon for the past year without suddenly becoming deserted, the street stalls have also made a significant contribution.</p>
<p>Chongqing has dance halls, but in terms of the entire population, the big spenders who frequent dance halls every night are still in the extreme minority. There are Beijing opera theaters, Sichuan opera theaters and cinemas, but the number of people they can accommodate is limited, and the ticket prices are too expensive, which is not entirely suitable for the economic situation of ordinary people. Thus, browsing the street stalls has become a form of entertainment for ordinary people, and it has gradually become a habit. Browsing the street stalls does not necessarily mean buying things, but it allows one to enjoy a wide variety of new and old items, which is the most economical and enjoyable experience that formal shops do not allow. Sometimes, standing around a street stall with two or three friends, talking about irrelevant matters or serious business, the stall owner is happy to have people joining in the fun and welcomes them. Spending time like this is naturally a different kind of pleasure than sitting and chatting in a teahouse.</p>
<p>Street Stalls are a Product of Victory</p>
<p>The reporter once attempted to divide the development process of Chongqing's street stalls into three periods. Within these three periods, each has its own operating characteristics and different types of goods. These three periods are: (1) the original period, (2) the transformation period, and (3) the white-hot period. For the sake of convenience, I will explain them in order below:</p>
<p>The first original period, began around the time the news of victory reached the capital, roughly up to the end of the Gregorian calendar year, lasting about four months. Initially, the general non-native people residing in Chongqing, shaken by the sudden arrival of victory, and also due to their overwhelming desire to return home, regardless of whether land and water transportation was difficult, and whether the value of daily necessities in the recovered areas was cheap or expensive, all emptied their chests and boxes, putting all the clothes they could not carry on the street stalls for sale at relatively low prices, so as to avoid regretting abandoning them once they set off. Therefore, the characteristics of this period are: (1) the stall owners are mostly non-native people, mainly the elderly, weak, women, and children, as adults generally do not have time for this, or are busy with official duties; (2) bargaining is particularly polite, and sometimes they sell as soon as you make an offer, first giving people the impression that buying things at the street stalls is indeed cheaper; (3) the items sold are mostly old goods, but because they are usually cherished, they are still beautiful and practical after washing and sorting, so that people do not dislike them; (4) the types of goods range from shoes, socks, hats, books, antiques, porcelain bowls and dishes, to all daily necessities, each street stall more or less showing the family situation, social status, and economic situation of the stall owner.</p>
<p>Used Clothing Store Employees Seize the Opportunity</p>
<p>The second transformation period, came quickly thereafter. Within this period, there were not many non-native people. The reason was not that the non-native people had already left, but that everyone had clearly recognized the difficulty of returning home. On the one hand, they had also heard about the prices in the recovered areas. Secondly, the lunar New Year was approaching, and even if they could leave, it would be next year's matter. As a result, reason prevailed over emotion, and it was better not to sell the daily necessities. However, the cheapness of the street stall goods had already established trust, and people had a good impression of them, so the local people seized the opportunity to take their place. Therefore, the characteristics of this period are: (1) the stall owners are mostly young employees of used clothing stores, who are ordered by the store owners to compete for customers in the streets and alleys with a new attitude; (2) there is no standard for bargaining, and sometimes it is more expensive than the original price. If one is not careful, one will be fooled; (3) the items sold are mainly old goods, and it is difficult to find unused items such as towels and elastic bands, but old clothes such as woolen coats, suits, or Zhongshan suits can be found in dozens of sets on each stall, making it clear at a glance that they are from used clothing stores, rather than from ordinary households. This kind of speculative street stall could not be maintained for long, and by March and April of this year, as goods from other places gradually arrived in Chongqing, it was naturally eliminated.</p>
<p>Smuggled Goods Reach Their Peak</p>
<p>By the time of the white-hot period, the development of the street stalls had reached its peak. In the first two periods, their scope of activity was limited to quiet streets and secluded alleys, but now their influence has spread to all prosperous streets, especially on both sides of Doyou Street and Daliangzi Road. They even go directly to the department stores to pick goods, such as in front of the stores selling cosmetics, where you can often find vendors selling glass, hair combs, elastic bands, and long stockings; in front of the stationery stores, you can often find vendors selling various fountain pens. All the goods are mostly smuggled, and are not subject to taxes and fees, and the expenses are also saved, so the selling price is lower. Under this threat, the general legitimate stores often take two ways to resist. In the passive aspect, they use the discount sales or clearance of various commemorative items to attract customers. In the active aspect, they simply choose some of the goods in the store and order the apprentices to set up street stalls outside the store to implement the occupation of space. Among these two methods, the latter is especially effective, making the general vendors secretly complain, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>"Package Carriers" are Very Active</p>
<p>Therefore, the characteristics of this period are: (1) most of the stall owners are "package carriers", especially those from Hubei, and the rest are apprentices from various stores; (2) almost all the goods sold are American goods smuggled from Shanghai and Hong Kong, mostly stationery, cosmetics, and novelties, and old goods have completely disappeared; (3) all the vendors are gathered in prosperous streets, and back streets and secluded alleys have returned to normal; (4) the mobility has reached its peak, and as soon as patrolling police appear, they can immediately put all the goods in boxes and take them to a quiet place to avoid them temporarily; (5) during this period, all taxes, transportation, city appearance, and order are directly or indirectly affected by them.</p>
<p>Measures to Ban Have Been Stipulated</p>
<p>Due to the various effects caused by the above-mentioned fifth point, the municipal authorities have recently taken necessary measures to ban them, but the general vendors are unwilling to show weakness due to livelihood reasons, and immediately established horizontal organizations to form a street stall association, using the power of the organization to protect their own interests. On the 2nd of this month, many representatives of the association went to the municipal government to petition, raising various demands and asking for protection. On the same day, the 335th municipal meeting of the municipal government decided: "The various street stalls in this city are everywhere, which not only damage the city appearance and hinder transportation, but also affect tax revenue. These street stalls originally belonged to the period of repatriation when people returning home sold old goods. The temporary nature has gradually changed into a place for selling new goods. A time limit should be stipulated, and temporary sites should be allowed for setting up stalls, and strict management should be implemented." It was decided that Chang'an Temple, Daitie Street, and Jiaochangkou are three places where temporary street stalls are allowed, and the time limit is the end of this year. After the expiration, they will be banned.</p>
<p>Street Stall Beauty Has Good Business</p>
<p>Everything will turn to its opposite, and street stalls cannot escape this common rule. I still remember that in front of the Le Lu Chun Restaurant near the Guotai Grand Theater, there was a street stall, and the stall owner was a young woman, very similar to Zhuo Wenjun running a wine shop. Her business was "absolutely great". Those curious went so far as to give her the nickname "Street Stall Beauty". Whenever the sun set and the electric lights were on, most of those standing around the stall did not care about the wine, but just came to feast their eyes on her beauty. Since the departure of the "Beauty of the West", the place has become very deserted. In the future, all street stalls will be banned, and Chongqing streets will probably never be as lively as they are now.</p>

<p>— A Word of Warning</p>
<p>These days, no one is very willing to engage in the publishing business; it is truly thankless and unprofitable. The employees are demanding pay raises, saying that the capitalists are exploiting them. The sales of publications are also not good. If you consider the cost and raise the price, the readers will say that you are destroying culture. If you do not consider the cost, there is no such principle in doing business. In terms of the content of publications, if it is too profound, it will be esoteric and unpopular, and no one will buy it; if it caters to low-level interests too much, people will scold you for being boring and selling savage heads; if you want it to be in-depth and easy to understand, and to write profound theories in popular language, such writers are not easy to come by. In addition, there are many political barriers and restrictions. Good works are not easily allowed to be published and distributed, and bad things, due to certain relationships, have to be published. Who would be willing to do such work?</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, the newspaper carried very good news, saying that Mr. Zhu Jingchen was willing to resign from his position as Vice Minister of Education to take the position of manager of the Commercial Press, and Director Gu of the National Education Department was also resigning from his official position to join the Zhonghua Book Company and engage in the publishing business. We feel that this is a gratifying phenomenon. The publishing industry needs such people with a spirit of sacrifice to work hard. We hope that they will not only be hardworking and dutiful, but also maintain the attitude of educators to run the publishing house, so that the Chinese publishing industry can release a brilliant light and serve as a cornerstone for the revival of China. We want everyone to understand that publishing is a very important job, and its mission is to promote culture. In whatever environment, it should move toward this goal. Engaging in this work requires a group of brave warriors. We are willing for many people to participate in this arduous work. Zhu and Gu have given us a very good example.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Original Discourse on the Chinese Economy <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Yang Hui and Wang Yanan, Sold by Kaiming Bookstore</p>
<p>In today's world, specialized treatises on the reality of the Chinese economy are rare treasures. Professor Wang Yanan's "Original Discourse on the Chinese Economy" is a most precise and fitting gift to our economic forum – delivering something most needed and desired.</p>
<p>It's no coincidence that a few words Professor Wang mentioned in the preface are exactly what I have been repeatedly saying to friends and seniors these past two years. At National Chiao Tung University, I also teach advanced economics courses. The teaching experience and resulting sentiments are coincidentally similar to those of Professor Wang at Sun Yat-sen University. These are perhaps the thoughts of other professors as well:</p>
<p>"...Based on my usual research, I believe I have greater certainty when lecturing on Ricardo's economic theories than when lecturing on Chinese economic history, but students show far greater excitement about the latter. At the time, I felt that this reason should not be solely attributed to the difficulty of reading and teaching Ricardo's great work, but rather to the question of whether Chinese students of economics, in their capacity as Chinese economic researchers, need to understand such abstract theories, or at least, whether the abstract theories they study can be related to reality, especially Chinese economic reality. Due to this feeling, I felt a great need for reform in the teaching materials and methods adopted in Chinese university lecture halls for economics and all related courses. I wrote this clearly at the time."</p>
<p>Let me briefly introduce this "Original Discourse on the Chinese Economy." It is not just an ordinary work similar to "Principles of Economics." As the author himself says, his purpose is vastly different. Writers of "principles" should take the saying "Everyone has it in their heart, but no one can write it down" as their guiding principle. Professor Wang, in addition to this, has also created outstanding new theories. Here are some of his words: "This book attempts to treat the entire Chinese economy as a unified process or movement permeated by certain basic economic laws. Therefore, the internal causal relationships between various economic forms are what I particularly want to analyze. The final section, or the eighth section, of this book is intended as a conclusion, as the ultimate consequence of the action of all basic laws, but due to insufficient data and the limitations of my personal research ability, I frankly admit that this book is extremely limited and may only be considered the beginning of a scientific and systematic study of the Chinese economy." The following few sentences are the author's humble and polite words, because in this book, I saw for the first time such a detailed dissection of the real Chinese economy. In the past decade, the domestic economy has undergone extremely complex wartime changes, and now it has become an extremely abnormal and chaotic situation. However, Professor Wang has given us the most complete and fundamental understanding and explanation of how the Chinese economy has evolved into this wartime situation (which is a question in the mind of every Chinese person today).</p>
<p>What must be introduced separately is the third chapter of this book, "The Forms of Chinese Currency." Everyone knows that all current Chinese economic problems are centered on currency. The late British economic authority, Sir Keynes, once proclaimed that economic theory can never be separated from monetary theory, and these two things are actually the same. I want to say to everyone who cares about the current Chinese economic crisis and likes to study all current Chinese problems: you must read this book. Please read Professor Wang's fundamental analysis of the most realistic and pressing problems in our current currency situation. It is truly insightful:</p>
<p>"We do not deny that appropriate monetary policies are very helpful to the development and prosperity of the entire economy, but based on our previous analysis, the role of currency has inherent limitations. In an economically developed country, its currency and even finance are linked to industry, and thus, it is possible to use sound financial organizations and appropriate monetary policies to greatly promote and lead the overall economy. However, in a backward economy like ours, our currency and finance are more closely linked to commerce. In the end, when commercial capital activities are extremely rampant, the function of currency and finance to correct this is bound to be limited!..."</p>
<p>The following chapters, "Forms of Chinese Capital," "Forms of Chinese Interest and Profit," "Forms of Chinese Wages," "Forms of Chinese Land Rent," and "Forms of Chinese Economic Panic," all use economic principles to dissect Chinese economic society. The method is to divide the main body of the Chinese economy into its various constituent forms and provide extremely detailed analysis and explanation. Within the limits of viewing economic panic as the inevitable culmination of the entire economic movement, the author, in the final conclusion of the eighth chapter, places those individual economic constituent forms in the whole to give a comprehensive examination. (Note: The title of the fifth section of the original book's eighth chapter is: "The Panic Genes and Their Consequences Manifested Under the Joint Action of General Economic Laws.")</p>
<p>"Our agricultural, underproductive, chronic, and regularized economic panic is produced under the joint action of the various laws embodied in the above-mentioned series of economic movements—small commodity production, commerce turning products into commodities, commerce dominating industry, commercial profit being higher than industrial profit, profit being regulated by interest, various unequal exchanges, capital concentrating in cities and foreign countries, the mutual interaction of various primitive capital forms in rural areas being the circulation of capital between them, labor expelling machinery, and even expelling animal power. Therefore, once the world panic reaches an upward or recovery cycle, we feel at ease that our economy is also entering a good state. This illusion is strengthened by superficial observations, that is, the belief that rent and taxes remain the same or increase. In fact, especially in our society, the increase in rent and taxes is not only a phenomenon that can coexist with the decline in social labor productivity, but it can even be directly regarded as a causal relationship and a phenomenon that must appear simultaneously...."</p>
<p>These are the genes of panic, and the consequences of our chronic and regular panic, as many economists are worried about, will probably become increasingly heavy and difficult to support if this trend continues. Those who superstitiously believe that Chinese economic panic is only the shock wave of the world economic panic should wake up, because to engage in economic reconstruction and take effective measures, the first step must be a sound understanding of the basic situation in the country.</p>
<p>The appendix of this book contains quite valuable information and theories regarding Chinese commercial capital, especially how commercial capital has been searching for its old path and development since the War of Resistance against Japan (after the outbreak of war, all the new objects and fields of commercial activity brought by international capital were successively lost, and at the same time, the limited domestic industry could not provide any significant avenues for commercial activity, so the result was that commerce "repeated its old tune" and regarded land products as its most likely and profitable speculative objects). The book has unique insights and detailed elaborations on the circulation problems of commercial capital and industrial capital. "Political Economy in China" and "The Austrian School of Economics in the Chinese Economic Community" can correct our common misconceptions about the Chinese economy. Based on Professor Wang's own years of experience and research, it can surely enable us to fully achieve the goal of exploring the entirety of the Chinese economic movement after reading this book.</p>
<p>After finishing "Original Discourse on the Chinese Economy" and closing the book, I would like to introduce this book to everyone who is interested in modern Chinese economic society.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Postscript on "Mass Education" <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Zaide</p>
<p>Publisher: Zhengzhong Book Company</p>
<p>Editor: Yu Qingtang</p>
<p>Publication Date: March of the Thirty-fourth Year (1945)</p>
<p>First Edition in Shanghai</p>
<p>The eight-year War of Resistance defeated the ambition of the invaders, allowing us to step back onto the path of national rejuvenation and embark on the milestone of nation-building. How gratifying it is that everyone is moving towards the common goal of "building the nation through education!" At this time when the authorities are striving to promote universal education – national education – we cannot ignore mass education. Moreover, about 80% of our country's population is illiterate. Among them, at least 200 million out-of-school youths and adults have not received education. Therefore, children's education and mass education should be advanced simultaneously, with both sides being taken care of and implemented together, in order to seek the common development and growth of universal education and meet the needs of nation-building.</p>
<p>We have widely surveyed Chinese publications, and the number of refined and substantial materials on mass education is still scarce. The author is now introducing Mr. Yu Qingtang, an expert in mass education, whose recent book on mass education published by Zhengzhong is worth reading by every person engaged in national education. The content of this book can be briefly introduced as follows:</p>
<p>The first chapter is an introduction, which first explains the relationship between education and society, and emphasizes the need to recognize the supreme principle that "education is life." For society to progress, the groups within society – the masses – must have the opportunity to receive universal education. Next, it explains the meaning and scope of mass education. Then, it explains how to conduct research on mass education.</p>
<p>The second chapter is on mass education and adult learning. Its intention can be said to be a kind of "psychological construction" for the ability of adults to learn. Based on the physiology and psychology of adults and many experiments by experts, the author points out that the learning ability of adults is not necessarily lower or higher than that of children; but at least it can be recognized that adults are superior to children or that children are not necessarily superior to adults. The traditional view that adults cannot learn or that adults' learning ability is not as good as children can be refuted without being attacked. At the same time, it also points out that the so-called decline in adult learning ability is due to (1) gradual decline in health; (2) weakening of learning interest; (3) scarcity of learning opportunities; (4) fear of ridicule and other reasons. The author instructs us to try to eliminate these unfortunate events, so as to increase the efficiency of adult learning.</p>
<p>The third chapter is on the masses and the social economy. The author first reminds us to recognize that "the focus of mass education is on the people's livelihood, and we should focus on the people's livelihood and start from the people's livelihood to achieve the progress of civil rights and the nation." Then, it explains the Chinese economic background, collects information from various sources, and analyzes its factors: (1) insufficient arable land; (2) the collapse of the rural economy; (3) the decline of national industry. It also cites many examples of the existing contributions of mass education to economic construction and how to achieve the greatest wish.</p>
<p>The fourth and fifth chapters are on the evolution of mass education in China and an overview of adult education in foreign countries. These two chapters can be said to be a discourse on the history of mass education in China and foreign countries, respectively explaining their characteristics, so that we can understand the differences between adult education in our country and adult education in foreign countries, and provide us with reference and lessons when implementing it.</p>
<p>The sixth chapter is a discussion of mass education and the education system. The author points out that in the current Chinese education system, there is only a school system, but no education system; and in the school system, only school education is listed, but not mass education. In the education system, mass education is still excluded from the door, and it is considered necessary to study and reform it. Next, it explains the administrative problems of mass education, and has excellent opinions. The main requirements of this chapter are: (1) the establishment of a new education system; (2) the construction of a new society. The country and the nation need to improve the culture of the vast masses and awaken national consciousness in order to undertake the work of building the country and revitalizing the nation.</p>
<p>The seventh chapter is on mass schools. The author tells us how to run a perfect mass school? It is the most practical and applicable information. (1) How to divide classes; (2) How to allocate courses and teaching materials; (3) How to compile grades; (4) How to teach; (5) How to solve the difficult problems of enrollment and retention; (6) How to implement moral education; (7) How can mass school teachers seek the progress of the school?</p>
<p>The eighth chapter is on mass education centers, respectively explaining their organization, business, and their implementation center institutions (1) mass education experimental zone, (2) mass library, (3) mass gymnasium, listing the undertakings that should be established. It also explains that mass education centers should be linked with other institutions in order to seek the development of their careers; and finally, it explains the necessary qualities of mass education center service personnel and their important responsibilities.</p>
<p>The ninth chapter is on mass education experimental undertakings. This chapter explains that the experimental undertakings of mass education in the future should be based on the actual needs of the local area and should apply scientific principles and methods to experiment. Issues such as rural autonomy, rural construction, and the integration of politics and education are all discussed. The author also introduces the actual situation of the three famous mass education research and experimental institutions in China, respectively explaining their characteristics, which can be used as a powerful reference for our future experimental undertakings.</p>
<p>The tenth chapter is on the purpose and method of mass education, which is the conclusion of this book. The author once said: "The purpose of mass education is high above real life and far in front of people." He also said: "If you want to relieve the people's poverty, the first thing to do is to take care of them and educate them. The ultimate goal of maintenance is to enable people to be self-sufficient. If you want to unite the people of the whole country to pool their wisdom and efforts to take care of each other, then the people must have the necessary knowledge and skills, which cannot be achieved without education, especially without engaging in adult mass education with all our strength... In particular, the leadership of the central government must be promoted to intensify its efforts in order to complete the great cause of the revolution and achieve the full success of revitalizing the nation!" Finally, it also points out many important principles and methods for implementing mass education, which can indeed give us a lot of help and motivation.</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into four major units, divided into ten chapters and thirty-eight sections, with a total of more than 90,000 words. The content is roughly as described above. As for the detailed content, it is still up to the readers to study and experience for themselves. It goes without saying that the biggest shortcoming of this book is that most of the information is pre-war. There is no discussion of the War of Resistance, which is regrettable! I hope the author can revise it in the next edition.</p>
<p>Finally, after reading this book, the author was inspired to make the following urgent demands for mass education at the current stage:</p>
<p>(1) "Ignorance" and "Poverty" - At present, the vast masses of China have a very strong desire for knowledge and hope to solve the pain of "ignorance"; but for the sake of livelihood, for the sake of solving the problem of life (that is, the problem of "poverty"), sometimes they cannot spare time to receive education and have to struggle on the starvation line, thus distracting them from their desire for knowledge. Because reading and acquiring knowledge does not necessarily solve their life problems. There is a saying circulating in the countryside of Pudong: "You can find food without knowing how to read; but you can't find food without knowing how to recognize people." Therefore, mass education in the future must first be able to solve this problem, just as the author reminded us in the third chapter, we must focus on the people's livelihood and start from the people's livelihood. That is to say, we must plan the construction of the entire social economy.</p>
<p>(2) "Selfishness" and "Dispersal" - Observing from all levels of society, we can find that individuals in society are "too selfish" in every event, showing "greed," "hypocrisy," and "luxury," only knowing personal enjoyment and the wealth and pleasure of one's own family. Observing from the groups in society, the groups are "scattered" and "unorganized," so the entire society is shrouded in an atmosphere of chaos. Therefore, mass education in the future should train its service ethics from individuals, and there must be a "greater self" before there can be a "lesser self"; from groups, it should strengthen its group organization, that is, strengthen the organization and training of the masses.</p>
<p>(3) "Disease" and "Weakness" - In every corner of society, there is filth and garbage everywhere; in every family, there is disorder, poverty and disease, forming an unhealthy country and the people are getting weaker day by day, presenting the decadence and lifelessness of the entire China! Therefore, mass education in the future must be able to rescue the "disease" and "weakness" of the Chinese masses, and should strengthen health education, enrich health facilities, and actively promote national sports.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Several Books on the Study of the Soviet Union <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is a world mystery. It is not only Americans who want to understand this mystery. Recently, Americans have written many books on the study of the Soviet Union, which can be used as references.</p>
<p>To study the Soviet Union, one should start with history. Professor George Vernadsky wrote a book for the Yale University Graduate School, A History of Russia. It is not long, but it is very concise. He does not focus on historical facts, but analyzes the Soviet people, Soviet culture, religion, philosophy, and the development of society and politics one by one, so that we can easily understand this seemingly contradictory nation. He does not engage in political theory. In the introduction, he said: "The task of the historian is to write history, not to deduce political or moral aspects. It is all right to agree with or oppose the Soviet political system, but the evaluation of this organization should not be preconceived." This book has been revised once after the Second World War and published by The Home Library.</p>
<p>Soviet Politics: At Home and Abroad, by Fredrick I. Schuman et al., published by Alfred A. Knoff. The author has written many books on international issues, the most famous of which is International Politics. The author has traveled to the Soviet Union and the Balkan Peninsula and is familiar with the Soviet situation. This book explores the truth of Soviet politics and diplomacy behind the scenes of Soviet propaganda policies. It seeks clues from the words and deeds of several Soviet leaders, the provisions of the constitution, and important international declarations, and pays special attention to the causes and consequences of changes in foreign policy. In the eyes of Americans, Soviet diplomacy is indeed a bit mysterious and unpredictable. The author mentions the question of whether the Slavic people can cooperate with Western democracies, and his views are quite accurate and the writing is also very fluent.</p>
<p>David J. Dallin was exiled abroad before the revolution, and later his political views were inconsistent with the authorities, but the books he wrote were fair and had the style of a historian. Russia and Postwar Europe seeks the basic objectives of Soviet foreign policy from the aspects of geography, people, and the course of the revolution, with complete and well-founded arguments. Churchill once regarded Soviet foreign policy as a sealed gourd. This sealed gourd is not easy to break, and it must be explained with reason to understand it. The author wrote this book with a calm mind, with new insights. Published by Yale University Press.</p>
<p>Russia and the Western World, published by The McMillan Company. Written by Max M. Laserson. The author was born in Latvia and graduated from St. Petersburg University. He taught for many years and wrote many books. This book explains the attitude of the Soviet Union towards other countries, especially Western countries, in the past 25 years from another point of view. He believes that this is evolved from political and social aspects. It has little to do with its leaders. The war has had a great impact on the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union still needs to have considerable cultural and economic ties with Western countries after the war. The author can calmly answer this difficult question.</p>
<p>Soviet Far Eastern Policy is one of the works of the Institute of Pacific Relations, by Harriet L. Moore et al., describing the relationship between the Soviet Union and various countries in the Far East, especially China and Japan. Most of its materials are collected in the Soviet Union and are rarely seen abroad. The book is appended with diplomatic documents, which is very convenient for reference. The author has paid much attention to the daily newspapers and periodicals published in the Soviet Union in the past ten years, is proficient in Russian, often travels in the Soviet Union, likes to communicate with Russians, and has extensive knowledge.</p>
<p>Henry A. Wallacc and Anorew J. Steiger co-authored Soviet Asia Mission, published by Reynal and Hitchcock. Americans know very little about Soviet Asia. This book is a record of the authors' travels. They took experts and translators and abandoned planes to inspect various places, paying attention to their economic development and diplomatic process, especially focusing on agricultural surveys. During the journey, they talked with businessmen, factory workers, teachers, and scientists, so it was not hearsay.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is also W. L. White's book Report on the Russians, which is also a true record. When the Soviet Union allowed Americans to travel freely, he ran all the way from the Caspian Sea to the Finnish front, and from Siberia to the US Air Force base deep in Ukraine. He met countless Russians, high and low, along the way, visited rural areas, and also visited industrial areas; visited battlefields, and also visited lively towns. What he heard and saw was not only very cautious, but also very humorous, with endless aftertaste. The book is published by World Publishing Company.</p>
<p>George B. Cressey's The Basis os Soviet Strength is dedicated to writing about the strength of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has one-tenth of the world's population and one-seventh of the territory. Its manpower and material resources cannot be underestimated. The author is a geography expert at Syracuse University and has recently returned from the Soviet Union. He has traveled to Siberia five times. The whole book discusses raw materials, new agriculture, climate, industry, ethnic background, and the characteristics of various regions. The materials are all obtained from field surveys and are not copied. The writing is lively and not boring. Published by Whittlesey House.</p>
<p>Science in Soviet Russia, published by The Jaques Cattell Press, is a collection of reports from various sources. The Soviet Union has been working hard on scientific research in recent years, is good at using radio, and has also made progress in genetics research, and is more attentive to treating wounded soldiers. The United States and the Soviet Union are fighting each other in this regard, competing for the short and long of the day.</p>
<p>Leon Trotsky, Stalin's political enemy, wrote a biography of Stalin, which has been translated into English. The book was not complete, only two-thirds of it was completed, and he was assassinated. Fortunately, the notes survived and were compiled into a book by Charles Malamuse and published.</p>
<p>Trotsky was a person in the know, and the description is intimate and flavorful. The process by which Stalin was able to gain power is recorded in more detail, and the materials are extremely rare.</p>
<p>Americans are enthusiastic about studying the Soviet Union, and they should know themselves and their enemies in the open and secret struggles.</p>

<p>I regret that only the names are listed in the "Siku Quanshu Summary," and the number of volumes, chapters, and versions are not specified. "New Lyrics Fiction" was undoubtedly compiled by people of the Ming Dynasty; "Smoke and Powder Spirits" may be the work of people of the Song and Yuan Dynasties, which is also unknown. Qian Zeng's "Yeshiguo Book Catalog" has four volumes of "Smoke and Powder Novels," written by people of the Song and Yuan Dynasties. This "Smoke and Powder Spirits" may be from the same period. This kind of title was commonly used by people of the Song and Yuan Dynasties, but rarely used by people of the Ming Dynasty. According to the former's record of novels, they belong to the "Smoke and Powder" and "Spirits" categories, so they are collectively referred to as "Smoke and Powder Spirits." These two types are not listed in Sun Kaidi's "Catalog of Chinese Vernacular Novels."</p>

<p>On the Translation of Musical Terms Zhu Lixing</p>
<p>Long ago, I had planned to write an explanation of my "personal position" on the issue of "Chinese transliteration" of musical terms. However, I felt that this matter might be "laborious and unrewarding," and would only invite much "blame for seeking perfection." From a slightly more "rational" perspective, it was truly "unnecessary."</p>
<p>However, now our era is about to complete the 1950s of this twentieth century. Since the Opium War, when the country's doors were opened, although our civilization has only moved forward and never retreated, comprehensively speaking of Western art in general, just in terms of the four most common types of "transliteration" or "translation of meaning"—"item names," "title explanations," "personal names," and "place names"—even now, each still goes its own way, and there is absolutely no unity. People in the country engaged in cultural work, even though they have hoped generation after generation for the education authorities to issue a clear plan, but who has seen such a public announcement or news? Therefore, many non-Chinese people who reside in China and can write and read Chinese characters often encounter many academic difficulties because of this. Because today it's "Xūbó," tomorrow it changes to "Xiūbótè," and the day after tomorrow it changes to "Xǔpōdé." In fact, it's just one person, "Schubert," who in China is no less than "Sun Wukong, who can pluck a hair and transform it into eighty thousand heavenly soldiers and generals." It is truly a "miracle." As for "Washington," "Berlin," and "Paris," which do not have these kinds of "miracles," they are ultimately a minority within the majority. One cannot therefore assume that there are no problems with "transliteration."</p>
<p>Some people say, "As long as the prominent ones like Washington, Berlin, and Paris that we have daily contact with do not undergo metamorphosis, that's enough. As for the rest that are not necessary for contact, or are not related to our daily lives, it doesn't matter if one person has three 'names.'" This kind of "loose sand theory" certainly cannot be dismissed as absolutely unreasonable. For example, European symphonies are understood by only a minority of Chinese people, so they are naturally placed in the category of "not related to our daily lives," and there is no need for the education authorities to issue a general order for "unified transliteration." But even considering "a minority within a minority," this kind of "Sun Wukong" with one person having three "names" is a bit too "inconvenient"!</p>
<p>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was a German, born in Salzburg, and never went to England, nor did he know English. But more than one hundred and fifty years after his death, he has now become (1) "Mòchādè," (2) "Mòcái'ěrdé," (3) "Móruò'ěrtè," (4) "Mòcházhādé," etc., in the mountainous country, completely transliterated according to English pronunciation. Frankly speaking, since the education authorities of a country do not ask or care about these "trivial matters," then at the very least, a member of the minority within a minority must clarify this person's nationality before cautiously transliterating his name. It's not that I'm being impolite, but there are many countries in Europe, and even more countries in the world. English is not Latin. Unless someone arbitrarily regards English as the "chief representative" of all foreign languages, the fact is that "Mòcái'ěrdé" is wrong, "Mòchādè" is also wrong, "Móruò'ěrtè" "Mòcházhādé," and even those that have not yet been "invented" are still "wrong." This is not my "law," but based on "original words," "nationality," and "dialect," England has never had a composer called "Mòchādè" etc., and there has never been such a person at all. There is such a person, and his transliteration in Chinese Mandarin is "Mózā." If you add a "tè" or "dé" at the end of those two characters, then it might not be that person.</p>
<p>I can't write about so many inconsistent transliterations at once, and it's not easy to correct them all at once either. But in my personal opinion, first, we must at least adhere to the morality of not turning people into "Sun Wukong" and transliterate cautiously. Second, we must absolutely adhere to the boundaries of the original word's "nationality" and "dialect" so that its pronunciation in Chinese Mandarin does not overstep the bounds (but sometimes, according to custom, "Bēiduōwēn" and "Bèiduōfēn" are not distinguished, but these two names do not violate the original German pronunciation). Third, if we truly cannot find such a character in Chinese Mandarin pronunciation, we should follow the initial transliteration that is commonly seen and maintain the original state. I believe that as long as we can adhere to these three points, we generally won't "mislead people."</p>
<p>Recently, I wrote an article, "New World Symphony," and I transliterated the composer (Antonin Dvorak) as "Āduōní·Fúxiàkè," which can be said to be accurate and appropriate, because I have personally heard college students majoring in music unanimously call "Fúxiàkè" as "Dé Fú Lāikè." Who knew that the "D" is silent, just like the "T" in "Mozart" is silent. In addition, the "R" should be pronounced as a "J" sound, which is even more complicated than "Mozart." This can only be blamed on Dvorak for "joking" when he chose his name.</p>
<p>Writing Attitude and Life Attitude Hu Yingdong</p>
<p>Writing attitude is equal to life attitude. If you cannot enrich your own life and establish a serious life attitude, then your writing will become lackluster under a morbid lifestyle and artificiality.</p>
<p>The beauty of language, the brilliance of language and words, is also the brilliance of your life. Real life cultivates in you a "bright and clear" life attitude. This life attitude, through your writing skills, then embodies the style of your work. Jack London's famous work, "Martin Eden," is completely refined from his personal real life. Martin Eden's life history is a part of his life history, and he has indeed gained the secret to developing his personality. Because he came from actual experiences as a sailor, laundry worker, etc., the class-type personality is fully overflowing in this work; from here, we can easily discover the consistent connection between his writing attitude and life attitude.</p>
<p>Of course, the so-called life attitude is not rootless duckweed; its roots sprout from the reflection of the entire social consciousness. In other words, it represents a kind of newest and most advanced consciousness in the real society: the refinement of this new consciousness, in a certain sense, is the abandonment of old dross, morbid residue, and what is radiated out. In Shanghai, there are works that represent the "petty citizen consciousness," specially provided for the idle old folks lying on sofas as items for appreciation. These kinds of works are filled with the air of the marketplace, yellow-colored interests, and the complex, decayed, queue-dragging clerk's air; these kinds of works are not worth anything; they are merely commodities that can fetch the highest price in the "manuscript market."</p>
<p>A sense of complaint, megalomania, tuberculosis-type sentimentality, and cell senescence and passion regression syndrome are all morbid phenomena in the writing attitude. It more or less circulates in the author's blood. These kinds of works will similarly infect readers, giving them nothing good, only giving them depression, melancholy, and distress.</p>
<p>Establishing a healthy life attitude is a difficult task. This is not merely a matter of the author's personal cultivation, but a real-life problem. If a poet goes into an ivory tower to find inspiration in order to write poetry, that is an extremely sad thing.</p>
<p>Living a down-to-earth life, feeling deeply, understanding real life clearly, seeing a wide world, touching a broad world, and encountering extraordinary people and events: under this multifaceted learning and experience, the works written will have a soul, have life, and have blood and flesh. Real-life subjects can give most people a deep and intimate feeling, and it will never make people feel monotonous, dry, and dark.</p>
<p>Hold a benevolent heart, use your limbs to feel, and use your brain to think; life is the soil of writing. Therefore, how to live life is the key to the problem.</p>
<p>How to live life leads to the approach you take to life, which is the problem of your outlook on life. How many people waste their breath talking about outlook on life, and how many people suffer and hesitate because of the problem of life; but they have caught a slight ailment: they have all isolated themselves and separated reality from themselves: this kind of view is precisely a third-person view. They have not grasped their own lives youthfully, and have not forced their own eyes to stare at the real world.</p>
<p>Expand the circle of life, expand the horizon, from the individual to the entire human race, and from the surrounding environment to the entire universe. In this, I can only use the four characters "expand the mind" to summarize it.</p>
<p>When crying, cry; when praising, praise; when criticizing, criticize; when rejoicing, rejoice; everything must be youthful in spirit. What is most to be feared is a stereotyped life attitude, and a veteran-like life attitude; these things do not require strange and profound nerves to twitch our nerves. Therefore, what we seek is a living brain, "using a living brain to feel a living life." This is our life attitude. Life is an epic; it is magnificent, it is also weak, it is like the clanging of metal and stone, and it is also like a babbling spring.</p>
<p>Gide's Quotes Tian Feng</p>
<p>Those who fear influence are simply admitting the poverty of their souls. Great thinkers do not fear influence, but are hungry and thirsty to seek influence.</p>
<p>An Inch of Territory, An Inch of Blood 65 Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>This Shuangqiao Station, on this branch line, is neither large nor small. When the train stopped here, it immediately became a bit chaotic, with people getting on and off, shouting and calling names. Only our group was squeezed between the porter and the police, and no one dared to break through.</p>
<p>"Go," the scar-eyed dog, looking like a fierce god, shouted at me and Tiger Brother, with a hint of wanting to get physical.</p>
<p>"What right do you have to tell us to go?" I could hardly restrain myself. "We're going to Tongxian. If you have something to say, go to Tongxian and talk to us."</p>
<p>"I don't care where you're going," the scar-eyed dog stretched out his hand. "You've broken the law. Come with us to the police station!"</p>
<p>This made me a bit embarrassed: going to the police station with them, the police station would of course be his gang of dogs, and we wouldn't be able to reason with them. But not going seemed impossible. Moreover, going there, who knows what would happen, wouldn't it be a waste of time? As the saying goes, "Desperation breeds wisdom," but even though I was "desperate" at this time, I couldn't come up with any "wisdom." Just when I couldn't figure out a solution, Tiger Brother suddenly stood in front of me, rushed forward, and spat a mouthful of saliva on the scar-eyed dog's face:</p>
<p>"Go!" Tiger Brother shouted, "The master's men, the master will go with you, see what you can do to the master."</p>
<p>Tiger Brother's saliva landed right on that guy's forehead. I saw him immediately grab it with both hands, shouting, "Ai yo."</p>
<p>"Little aunt," Tiger Brother turned back to me and said, "You don't need to get off the train, just go with the train. I know this place, and I'll catch up right away." As he said this, he winked, turned around, pushed aside the few guys blocking the way, and walked towards the train door. The guy who had been spat on closely followed behind.</p>
<p>Tiger Brother's move made me even more undecided, but this was also a helpless solution—the two of us would separate, and I could go to Tongxian first to find reinforcements. I thought Tiger Brother might have other solutions, and he certainly wouldn't be taken advantage of. It's just that it was difficult for me to go to Tongzhou alone, meeting people for the first time, and having to ask for help before even getting things done. Where would my face be? As I was spacing out, I caught sight of the guy dressed as a merchant waving his hand and shouting at the group of dogs, "No, we've injured someone again, we have to get that woman down too, she's a witness!"</p>
<p>With his command, I saw the other two police officers silently grab my handbag and snatch Tiger Brother's package, running straight to the train door. I thought, "It's better to get off, it would probably be difficult not to," so I followed behind the two police officers and walked towards the train, so as to avoid further trouble. The country folks on the train were all staring with wide eyes, with fearful expressions on their faces.</p>
<p>As soon as I got off the train, I saw Tiger Brother still standing on the platform, looking at the train engine, perhaps waiting to watch the train leave? But glancing over, he saw me get off the train and ran over to ask, "Why did you get off too?" I told Tiger Brother, "No way, I was squeezed by them, I probably had to get off." The saliva-covered scar-eyed dog also rushed over in surprise and alarm, afraid that Tiger Brother would get lost. I saw that he had already wiped off the saliva, and there was a large red mark on his forehead.</p>
<p>(I remember when we were in the village before, Tiger Brother told me that he could hit people with saliva, and I said he was lying. He said he would show me; he pursed his lips and called over a dog, and he spat a mouthful of saliva on the dog's head. The dog seemed to have been hit with a stick, and ran away immediately, barking all the way. He said this was Qigong, and he only used thirty percent of his strength.)</p>
<p>"Are there any people from our village here?" I held Tiger Brother's hand and walked towards the outside of the station, asking him in a low voice.</p>
<p>"I don't know if there are... but it doesn't matter... If we really go to the police station, I have a way."</p>
<p>"What way?" I was half-believing and half-doubting.</p>
<p>"I'm just afraid they won't go to the police station. I've heard that there are many of our people in the police force in Tongzhou City. This place is very close to there, only about ten miles away. Maybe there are one or two? If not, I'll have to make a big commotion, and naturally someone from our side will come..." Tiger Brother seemed very confident.</p>
<p>Fallen Leaves Yang Mou</p>
<p>Life has gatherings and dispersals, and aren't green leaves withering and yellowing?</p>
<p>As soon as I stepped into society, it was dyed with a strong atmosphere of sadness. In times of joy, I seemed to have already glimpsed the harbinger of storms, and a little withering and loneliness added countless sorrows to me.</p>
<p>The streets of summer are brilliant, injecting the stimulant of life into everyone with vitality. The scenery of autumn, however, brings everyone a mourning for decay. The leaves turn yellow, wither, and fall, rolling on the ground with the dust. No one can predict the destination of life, but who wants to have life wither and be lonely like this!</p>
<p>When we examine those fallen leaves, I seem to recall their dashing and heroic appearance, and I seem to have reviewed their beautiful history once again. However, not even a trace remains, and their short lives have passed fleetingly.</p>
<p>I want to bid them farewell. When they were rejoicing, people appreciated them, but when they withered, people discarded them. There are even more cruel facts in the world, and there is no room to talk about injustice.</p>
<p>I bless them to put on new clothes next year, and when they return to the world, to carefully calculate the warmth and coldness of the world.</p>

<p>Free Talk Shaofu</p>
<p>The cheapest entertainment is none other than a stroll in the park. May I ask, is a twenty-yuan entrance ticket the same as being free? Twenty yuan can only buy one-fifth of a fried dough stick. I once saw a fifty-yuan bill lying on the road, and several pedestrians passed by without even looking at it.</p>
<p>The parks of Shanghai each have their own unique charm. In the central district, the Bund Park is full of the beauty of movement. The cars, horses, and pedestrians on the road, the barges and sails in the river, a symphonic movement, are sounds that cannot be heard in other parks.</p>
<p>Sitting on a bench by the river, watching those boats coming and going, we must regain a little of our childlike innocence. Isn't the scene similar to children watching toy warships moving in a washbasin? Water inspires people's leisurely thoughts, and at the very least, it can cleanse the mind. At the corner where the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek meet, you can sit there mesmerized for half a day, reluctant to leave the scenery before your eyes.</p>
<p>Even if you turn your head to look at the rows of towering buildings on the Bund, golden domes, round heads, matchbox-style... although they are financial fortresses, manipulating the lives of countless people, the buildings are magnificent enough, supporting the sky of Shanghai.</p>
<p>People hurrying about in offices, shopping malls, elevators, cars, dance halls, and restaurants, please spend half an hour to stroll in the park!</p>
<p>Random Thoughts "Face Problem" S.S</p>
<p>In China, everything is about "face." When two families get into a lawsuit, if you want to find a way to mediate between them, then both sides must solemnly say: "Mediation is of course good, but my face must be fully supported. It doesn't matter if I spend a little more money on this." So, in the streets and alleys, people "fight each other" to the point of having black eyes and swollen noses. As long as a string of firecrackers is set off, the brother who was beaten will show a proud smile from the pain of broken skin and bleeding, because he has "face." When your own daughter or beloved wife is seduced and abducted by someone else, you not only remain silent, but also tell others not to reveal the secret, beautifully calling it "family scandals should not be publicized," but in reality, isn't it because you are afraid of losing "face" and your "reputation" going bankrupt!</p>
<p>Because of this, the business of teahouses and hotels thrives. Often, an extremely ordinary problem that can be solved with just a few words must involve a feast at Meilongzhen today and Xinghualou tomorrow, two catties of aged Shaoxing wine, and several courses of rich food. In the midst of tipsiness and flushed faces, they start with national affairs, speak freely about the political situation, and talk at length about women, before finally returning to the main topic. Once the theme is brought up, the guests are already tipsy, and in a daze, they only see the host's warm hospitality, bowing and scraping, and feel full of glory and comfort. The biggest things are completely O.K. between half-hearted compliance and a welcoming send-off. Even if you have suffered a bit of grievance because of this matter, a grand banquet and a few drinks will fill the gaps in the regret. By tomorrow, there will be many pink invitations to "Respectfully request your esteemed presence" pressed under the glass plate, knowing full well that small banquets every three days and large banquets every five days are harmful to time and the stomach, but when you think of it as "face," how can you not have face? So, you swallow a few "food supplements" and happily attend again; the sounds of pipes and strings in the restaurants are noisy, and the restaurants are crowded with people; "face" can then be seen shining in the crowd!</p>
<p>Officials are even more proficient in "face," being outstanding in their field; Tao Yuanming resigning from his post for five dou of rice was probably because that supervising official damaged his "face" when he bent over; this was a long time ago, but it makes us feel that we are both a bit too stubborn and close to clumsy. People now understand much better, and superiors have realized that if this trend continues, it will make people disdain to occupy the position of subordinates and officials, then the officialdom will not be like the officialdom; so bending over is still necessary, but "face" is maintained to the highest limit for you. In this way, everyone can feel at peace and satisfied. Look, hasn't He ×× already had "face" first, and then, under "joint impeachment," wasn't Lu Shizeng, the president of the Yunnan High Court, clearly transferred to the president of the Andong High Court afterward? Although it is "not in line with the situation," "face" must still be left for them.</p>

<p>Anecdotes Cocktail Party This Newspaper Data Room</p>
<p>(Editor's Note: This article is a response to readers' questions from this newspaper's data room and is deemed to have a need for public release, so it is hereby disclosed.)</p>
<p>Regarding the origin of the cocktail party, there is such a legend:</p>
<p>In a certain town in South America, there was a small hotel, the owner of which was named Arden. All hotel affairs were personally managed by this old owner and his young and beautiful daughter, Mary.</p>
<p>Arden had a hobby of raising chickens. The chickens he kept were of various kinds, totaling no less than hundreds. Therefore, inside and outside the hotel, under the tables and chairs, there were often traces of them. Their fluttering, crowing, and shouting mixed with the drunken guests' clamor, laughter, and noise. Among the chickens, there was a rooster weighing fifteen pounds, with a red crown and phoenix tail, very tall and large, which was most loved by old Arden. He specially named it "Shuoguo."</p>
<p>One evening, the chickens returned to their nests, and upon inspection, "Shuoguo" happened to be missing. Arden spent a sleepless night in anxiety. Afterward, Shuoguo never returned, and the old owner's face was constantly filled with sorrow. Later, he simply closed the door and stopped business, posting a notice on the door offering a reward for finding the chicken: "This store has lost a large rooster. Anyone who finds and returns it will be rewarded with three hundred pounds, and I will never break my promise." He fully believed that with a heavy reward, there would be brave men, and "Shuoguo" would surely return safely. Unexpectedly, after five days, there was still no news. The old owner loved the chicken so much that he added a line under the notice: "And I am willing to give my daughter in marriage, and I will never regret it." For a time, the entire town was in an uproar, and everyone was fantasizing about finding "Shuoguo" and being able to marry Mary.</p>
<p>The next morning, before the red sun had risen high, someone was knocking loudly on the hotel's door. The owner opened the door and saw a handsome young man holding "Shuoguo" in his arms. The old man was overjoyed, and the young man explained his intention. Arden was overjoyed and wept, saying, "Please put the chicken down, and everything can be done."</p>
<p>The next day, the hotel was decorated with lanterns and streamers. Congratulatory guests filled the door, treating guests like family. Mary poured wine for the guests. One wanted champagne, another called for grape wine, and another called for whiskey. She was unable to fulfill each request one by one, so she mixed all kinds of wine in a large wine vat and then distributed a cup to each of them.</p>
<p>The guests tasted this cup of wine and found the taste to be fresh. They asked about the name of the wine. Mary couldn't answer, and in her anxiety, she suddenly saw "Shuoguo" raising its head, shaking its tail, and displaying its colorful plumage, dazzling and dazzling. So, she answered casually, "Cocktail."</p>
<p>That day's banquet was then named "Cocktail Party" by one of the guests. Since then, people far and wide have imitated it, and it has been passed down to this day, becoming a kind of banquet for entertaining VIPs.</p>

<p>How Roosevelt Dealt with Stalin (4) By Frances Perkins, reviewed by Ge Chunliang</p>
<p>Many loyal old Democrats, at that time, felt that he was indeed looking down on them. I remember the old Tim Sullivan, a councilman from the Bowery district, who was himself the center of a group of interesting people, said after a debate with Roosevelt: "A very arrogant man, that Roosevelt."</p>
<p>But in August 1912, during a summer vacation, Roosevelt was attacked by a childhood polio. He escaped alive in great danger, when he was only one step away from death.</p>
<p>During the long years of illness, Roosevelt underwent a great change of soul. I noticed that when he came back, he already had a character of bravery and perseverance. Pain and disaster had dispelled all his arrogance.</p>
<p>He never showed a hint of misery for any misfortune. On the occasional occasion, he told people that he had a particularly strong religious belief. He firmly believed that it was God's intervention that saved him from paralysis, despair, and death. He understood the principle that faith gives the soul a place to belong, and understood that a person's small power should be united with God's great power. (Containing the so-called meaning of doing one's best and leaving the rest to fate. - Translator)</p>
<p>Roosevelt was able to deal with the British with ease. But he found it more difficult to deal with the Russians. He found the Russian people interesting. I remember once, after the Tehran Conference, a conversation I had with him, he recalled, "I wish I could understand the Russians more deeply, Frances, do you understand my people?"</p>
<p>I replied, "No, I'm sorry, I only know a few in the embassy, and a few White Russian refugees driving taxis in Paris."</p>
<p>"Ah," the President said, "I wish someone would tell me about some Russians. I can't see a good Russian and a bad Russian. I can distinguish a good Frenchman and a bad Frenchman. I can distinguish a good Italian and a bad Italian; but I cannot understand the Russians. I don't know what it is that makes them so mysterious. Try to see if you can answer me what it is that makes them so mysterious?"</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I didn't have time to study the Russians deeply, but I read some books about Russia and often talked to several people who had lived in Russia, and often passed on what I knew to the President. On one occasion, I told him how one person, who had lived in Russia for a long time, answered my question, "What is it that makes the Russians so mysterious?" He said this sentence, "It is the desire to fulfill God's will!"</p>
<p>I asked again: Did the person who said this mistake the modern Russians for the Russians who deeply believed in the old religion before the revolution? But he insisted that they had the same character.</p>
<p>When I told the President this, he said, "You know, that sentence may have some meaning. That could explain why they have extended their almost mystical faith to communist society. They seem to be willing to do those things that are good for society. We take care of our own faces first, and then we work for the welfare of society."</p>
<p>In Tehran, Roosevelt dealt with Stalin with curiosity and goodwill. (The End)</p>
<p>News Figure New Administrative Relief Director Mr. Huo Shubao Qiu Nü</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang Tingfu, the director of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, has resigned and is succeeded by Mr. Huo Shubao, the chief auditor of the Bank of China. Huo was originally a business figure, and his acceptance of the new appointment is just like the Minister of Economic Affairs, Mr. Wang Yunwu, entering officialdom from business.</p>
<p>Huo, whose style name is Yamin, is from Xinhui, Guangdong. In his early years, he was ordered by Mr. Zhang Jingjiang, a veteran of the Kuomintang. (Huo was initially the secretary of the Central Construction Committee, and Zhang was the chairman). Zhang relied on him quite heavily. In 1930, when Zhang once took charge of Zhejiang's politics, Huo was also summoned to Zhejiang at the end of that year, serving as the chief secretary of the Zhejiang Construction Department.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1932, the director of the Construction Department, Cheng Zhenjun, was sent to England for inspection, and Huo was appointed as acting director. In the spring of the following year, Cheng returned, and the provincial government divided the Construction Department into rural, fishery, and mining departments, and appointed Huo as the director of the three departments. His responsibilities and powers were no less than those of the director. However, when Huo served as the director of these three departments, although he worked extremely hard on planning, he ultimately failed due to the provincial government's emptiness and disputes. The three departments were only established for three months before being merged. At that time, Zhang Nanxian happened to be transferred by the central government to be the chairman of Zhejiang. Zhang Jinglao returned to his official position in the capital, and Huo also followed him back to the capital, being appointed as the director of the design department of the Central Construction Committee. Two years later, he was transferred to the United States for overseas inspection. Three months later, he returned to China, and soon after, he suddenly resigned and joined the Bank of China, serving as the chief auditor, until today, almost ten years without any changes.</p>
<p>Huo has an extraordinary appearance. When he was in Zhejiang, the people of Zhejiang called him "handsome man"; but Huo knew how to cherish himself and was cautious in choosing a spouse. During his time in Zhejiang, the inner court was still empty, and it took a long time before he found a good match. His wife, Ms. He, has an elegant demeanor and is skilled in music. She is fluent in spoken Chinese, English, German, and Russian, and is also good at socializing.</p>
<p>Trivial Matters about Li Yimang, a Chairman in the "Liberated Area" Xue Ou</p>
<p>According to reports, the residence of Li Yimang, chairman of the Soviet Border Region Government of the Communist Party, at No. 4 Anpan Lane in Huaiyin, is exquisitely furnished, exceptionally luxurious, with walls full of calligraphy and paintings, and a large collection of antiques. More than ten boxes of valuables were taken away during the retreat. The two beds that were not taken away, one was made of ebony and fine rattan, inlaid with marble, and the other was used in summer, the entire bed except for the wooden frame was made of glass, all extremely precious.</p>
<p>This news figure is little known in history by the general public, but he was quite famous in the communist cultural circles twenty years ago. Li's original name was Ouyang Jixiu, with the pen name Hua Han. He studied in Japan and, after returning to China, joined the New Literature and Art circles, together with Li Chu, the communist representative of the 27th small group of the Military Mediation Department, were both active members of the later Creation Society. (The Creation Society was a famous New Literature and Art organization in China, divided into two periods. The core figures of the early period were Guo Moruo, Yu Dafu, Wang Duqing, etc., who advocated Romantic literature. The later period was presided over by Li et al., who specialized in propagating communism and advocating so-called Proletarian literature) He once edited a small bi-monthly publication "Quicksand," advocating class struggle very fiercely, so it was soon banned from publication, and the Creation Society was also banned because of this.</p>
<p>When the later Creation Society was at its peak, someone suddenly opened a "Shanghai Cafe" on North Sichuan Road, which was known as mysterious, and it also employed waitresses. This was truly innovative at the time, so it attracted a group of revolutionary writers who advocated proletarian literature, and they were all frightened by it. Li Yimang and Jiang Guangchi were both regulars at this cafe, flirting and joking with the waitresses from time to time, and anecdotes circulated. Sometimes, unable to restrain themselves, they often expressed themselves in writing, so it was inevitable that some people criticized them for not matching their words with their actions, which can be said to be exactly the same as his current behavior.</p>
<p>Li was originally a literati, so according to his neighbors, he enjoyed poetry and books in his spare time, and he still retained the nature of a scholar. However, recently, he wrote a poem "Nine Granny Mountain," praising the late Ming Dynasty Li Chuang to the highest degree, praising the outlaws, which is somewhat undesirable.</p>
<p>Fish, Shrimp, and Turtle Compete in Elections, Each with Its Own Merits Zhou Wen</p>
<p>Among the aquatic creatures, because the locality was not peaceful, they tried to implement Baojia. Fish, Shrimp, Crab, and Turtle were publicly recommended as candidates for Bao Chief. Therefore, they individually delivered election speeches, the content of which was rich and wonderful, and full of beauty. Now, the main points are selected and recorded briefly below.</p>
<p>Fish said: "Checking the effectiveness of work, the first is the mouth. The mouth can order everything, publish everything, and control everything. This is a condition for being successful. Please vote for me."</p>
<p>Shrimp said: "...Checking that the mouth cannot represent everything, being good at talking does not necessarily mean being good at doing. I have a delicate and clever figure, daring to go to large places and able to enter small places. There is a pincer in front and a knife on the head. This is a guarantee of strength... Please give me a hand!"</p>
<p>Crab said: "...If happiness befalls me and I am elected, I will never employ private individuals. I hate the tradition of 'a new emperor, a new courtier' the most. Just with so many hands and feet, I can stand alone. I can't speak, but the Big Pincer will speak for me. (It raises two big pincers) It's all about action. If it doesn't work, I'll run rampant. Please...don't forget I'm called Crab."</p>
<p>Turtle said: "...Thinking that the most important thing for candidates is experience. I come from a noble family in the water, which is the first point. I have the skills of two floors, able to climb and able to swim. If an event occurs on land, no one is better than me. This is the second point. My hands and feet may not</p>

<p>The Twice-Dreamed Dream of the Painted Chamber</p>
<p>"The Twice-Dreamed Dream of the Painted Chamber," originally named "A Continued Dream缘 of the Red Chamber," also known as "The Mirage 情梦," consists of forty-eight chapters. There is a reprinted edition from the Yichou year of the Jiaqing reign. Yao Bian's "Outline of the Dream of the Red Chamber" records an edition published by Rui Ning Hall. Sun Kaidi's "Catalog of Chinese Vernacular Novels" states: "Written by a certain Wang of the Qing dynasty, using the pseudonym 'Master of 　　.' It begins with a preface by the Recluse of the Bixie Garden of Xiling from the fourth year of the Jiaqing reign. The phrase 'Our family's Mr. Fengzhou' appears in the first chapter, indicating the author's surname is Wang. The book continues after Gao E's one hundred and twenty chapters." According to Sun's research, it was written by the Recluse of the Landao Island. Besides this book, there is also a book of anecdotes titled "Absurd 　　Words." This summer, I borrowed it from Mr. Zhou Xuliang and read it once. This book contains many obscene words, so during the Tongzhi reign, Ding Richang's list of prohibited obscene novels included it as the twelfth item ("Regulations of Jiangsu Province during the Tongzhi Reign"). The book is in a pocket-sized format, in five volumes. It begins with a preface by the Recluse of Lan 　 from the Jiayin year, and a postscript by the Carefree Man of the Mian Garden, containing the phrase "My younger brother Guan 　." Later, among the inscriptions by various individuals, there is also one by Wang Bixie Garden, indicating that the author is Wang Lan 　, with Bixie Garden being his elder brother, who is frequently mentioned in the book and is also the author of the preface to "The Twice-Dreamed Dream of the Painted Chamber." The preface only records the Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch year without the reign year. Based on the events in the entire book, Jiayin is determined to be the fifty-ninth year of the Qianlong reign. It involves many historical traces of the author, which are extracted and presented below in chronological order:</p>
<p>Volume Two, Ode to Spring, says: "After the Zhonghe Festival in the Bingxu year, the minister of this ministry, Wang 　 Garden, gathered famous scholars from various provinces at the Taoran Pavilion south of the capital to compose poems about spring... Wang Sheng Lanzhi, a native of Wulin, was the youngest... Wang wrote it immediately." This passage is autobiographical. Lanzhi is suspected to be his original name, and his place of origin can also be inferred from it. Bingxu is the thirty-first year of the Qianlong reign.</p>
<p>Volume Three, Dream Confirmation, says: "In the Gengzi year, 囗囗 resided in the capital, and obtained the Juren degree in the autumn." Gengzi is the forty-fifth year, passing the provincial examination.</p>
<p>Volume Two, Tiger Master, says: "I have heard this saying since I was young and did not believe it. When I governed Shouting, the land was entirely mountainous, the soil was barren, and the people were poor. I have a poem saying: 'The meager salary barely exceeds five dou, the desolate city is remotely located in ten thousand mountains,' which is a true record." It is a pity that the year he served as the prefect of Shouning in Fujian is not recorded.</p>
<p>Volume Three, Xia Dehai, says: "The Luoyang Bridge is outside the city of Quanzhou... When I was transferred to Chihkan, I traveled east from Fuzhou to Xiamen by sea, and passed over the bridge on both journeys." Furthermore, Volume Four, The Demon Crow of Taiyang, records that when he served as the magistrate of Chihkan in Taiwan, he encountered the Lin Shuangwen rebellion: "In the Yisi year, I was transferred to Chihkan, and arrived in the ninth month... The following year, in the Bingwu summer, there was the case of Zhuluo sending official to Douliumen... The following year, Dingwei... This campaign started in the eleventh month of Bingwu and the main force returned victoriously in the third month of Wushen, lasting eighteen months, and I was involved throughout." The above occurred between the fiftieth and fifty-third years of the Qianlong reign.</p>
<p>Volume Three, Spring Lantern Riddles, says: "In the Jiyou year, I lived in the provincial capital," which refers to events in the fifty-fourth year.</p>
<p>The same passage also says: "I visited Dongou and went out to see the lantern riddles on the Yuan Night." Volume Three, Dream Confirmation, says: "More than ten years later, I resided in Lucheng... I thus have the poem 'Amidst rivers and mountains, a traveler lodges in the Ou Sea, in wind and rain, by a cold lamp, I dream of the Wan City.'" Volume Five, Planchette Poetry, says: "In the Xinhai year, I resigned and returned to Yongjia." All of these refer to events in the fifty-sixth year. The "Absurd Words" was completed in the fifty-ninth year, and five years later, in the fourth year of the Jiaqing reign, "The Twice-Dreamed Dream of the Painted Chamber" was completed. - The verifiable events in the life of Wang are roughly as described above.</p>

<p>Much of what is recorded in "The Scholars" is drawn from earlier miscellanies. For example, chapter twelve, "The Knight Errant Falsely Sets Up a Meeting with Severed Heads," is based on Feng Menglong's "Discussions in the Osmanthus Garden," and chapter thirty-eight, "Filial Son Guo Meets a Tiger in the Deep Mountains," is based on Zhang Du's "Anecdotes from Court and Countryside." The sources of both have been found by Tianmu Mountain Hermit (Zhang Wenhu). Jiang Ruizao's "Textual Research on Novels," volume seven, quotes "Random Notes from the One-Leaf Studio" by the recent scholar Sha Ou, which also identifies several sources. However, the cited documents are either of later origin or not the original text, making them difficult to trust.</p>
<p>The matter of the ugly Taoist priest in chapter thirty of "The Scholars," "The Young Lover Visits a Friend at the Temple of Divine Music," is found in Ming He Fuzuo's "Random Talks from the Huadang Pavilion," volume seven, in the section on Xu Fangbo. The text states: "Xu Ziyu, whose name was Zhonghang, was hospitable and particularly fond of handsome youths. An extremely ugly guest, confident in his poetic abilities, was recommended to Ziyu by Mr. Cai Zimu. Cai wrote a letter praising the guest's likable qualities, fearing that the guest might see the letter and demand it, he treated it as a family matter. Ziyu was delighted upon receiving the letter and eagerly welcomed him, but was shocked and could not stop laughing. He presented the guest with a poem: 'Confident that your golden voice can shake the earth, who knew that your jade appearance is less pleasing to the eye?' The guest was still pleased and circulated the poem for appreciation." (The textual research cites "Solid Gourd Collection.")</p>
<p>Chapter thirty-five, "Zhuang the Recluse Resigns His Title and Returns Home," records how Zhuang the Recluse was stung by a scorpion and unable to attend court. According to Ming Lang Ying's "Seven Corrections," volume forty-three, the section on harmful insects contains the following: "During the Tianshun reign, the recluse Wu Yubi arrived in the capital. Emperor Yingzong summoned him to the Wenhua Hall for an audience and asked him about general affairs. Wu remained silent and only said, 'Allow me to submit a memorial.' The audience was surprised, and the Emperor, displeased, stood up and left. Wu went to the Right Shunmen Gate, removed his hat, and saw a scorpion on his head, its sting causing redness and swelling of the skin. People then understood that he was unable to answer due to the pain. During the Chunxi reign of the Song dynasty, the imperial censor Shi Lun was serving as a reader. He happened to mention something about Emperor Gaozong, and suddenly tears streamed down his face. The Emperor asked why, and he replied, 'I am moved by the late Emperor's kindness!' Emperor Xiaozong also shed tears. The next day, the imperial decree appointed Shi as a Vice Minister. It turned out that he was bitten on the mustache by a centipede and could not bear the pain. Alas! Both were bitten on the head by harmful insects. The one who was respectful was ridiculed, while the one who was deceitful received favor. Is this not fate!" (The textual research cites Xie Zhaozhe's "Sifting Sand from the Sea of Literature.") The event recorded in "The Scholars" is the former one. This event is also found in Ming Zhou Qingyuan's "Second Collection from West Lake," volume three, "The Clever Student Loses His Stance in the Golden Luan Hall." The latter event is also found in Qing Qian Yong's "Casual Talks from the Garden of Footprints," volume two, scholars section two (laughingstock), Scorpion Prefect: "During the early Yongzheng reign, an assistant prefect was granted an audience. A scorpion was hidden in his hat, and when it tried to get out, it stung his head painfully, causing him to cry. Emperor Shizong saw this and was astonished. He asked what was wrong, and the official took off his hat, kowtowed, and knelt, saying, 'I am mindful of the late Emperor Shengzu's sixty-one years of benevolence and virtue. My family has received favor for two generations, and I could not help but weep.' Emperor Shizong said, 'This man still has a conscience,' and recorded his name for future appointment as a prefect." Later, he was called the Scorpion Prefect." Because these two events have been passed down for a long time, they have become "talking points." "The Scholars" probably collected such "talking points" to create the book.</p>
<p>Chapter seventeen, "Doctor Zhao Presides Over the Poetry Circle" - narrating the joint birthday of the doctor and the magistrate, is found in Ming Zheng Zhongbian's "New Ears," volume eight, "My friend Li Qian of Qianshan, Wang Guozhu, and my disciple Mao Shi of Yushan were all born on the same day... Li passed the Jinshi examination in the Wuchen year and was appointed a Compiler, but died in office without children; Mao had many children, all of whom are outstanding, and he is still alive." (The textual research cites the same book, but the text has been changed in many places.)</p>
<p>Chapter five, "Yan Jiansheng Dies in His Bed," records Yan Jiansheng raising two fingers before his death. According to Ruan Kuisheng's "Teatime Talks with Guests," volume fifteen (Wang's Complete Edition), this was a real event at the time. The text states: "Wu Binting said: A certain merchant from Yangzhou had a fortune of millions but lived no differently from ordinary people. On his deathbed, he could not speak a single word. Relatives and friends surrounded him. Suddenly, at night, he raised two fingers and kept gesturing with his mouth. His son said, 'Is father worried that Erlang is too young to manage the business?' He shook his head no. The son then said, 'Is he worried that his second uncle will cheat and bully Erlang?' He shook his head no. Everyone was astonished. His wife arrived later, looked around the room, and said, 'He wants to pick out the two wick stalks from the oil lamp bowl.' The wealthy man lowered his hand, nodded, closed his eyes, and died. Gongdu and Shanting both personally witnessed this man, it is not a fabrication." Wu Binting's name was Huang, who was the son of Wu Jingzi, the author of "The Scholars." Ruan Yuan's "Biographies of Scholars" and Li Dou's "Record of the Yangzhou Painted Boats" contain biographies of him.</p>
<h3 id="e220">The Illustrated Exposition of Investiture of the Gods <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>As Yuan and Ming dynasty novels were passed down, commentators arose in droves. For example, the book "Journey to the West" has six versions, including "Journey to the West: A Treatise on Spiritual Realization," "Journey to the West: The Original Intent," and "Journey to the West: The True Explanation." However, "Investiture of the Gods" has only two versions: Zhong Bojing's annotated edition and "The Illustrated Exposition of Investiture of the Gods." The latter is a manuscript and not a widely circulated book. Sun Kaidi's "Catalog of Chinese Novels," volume five, records "The Illustrated Exposition" as: "Unseen. Written by Jing of Qing. Yu Yue's 'Miscellaneous Writings from the Chunzai Studio,' six supplemental volumes, 'Preface to Yu Huyin's Illustrated Exposition of Investiture of the Gods,' states: 'There is a Mr. Yu from Renhe, named Jing, with the pseudonym Huyin, who, imitating the example of Wu Yizi's commentary on Journey to the West, wrote The Illustrated Exposition of Investiture of the Gods. His ingenuity in conceiving and his cleverness in understanding are as skillful as Wu Yizi's, though expressed in a different way.' It also says: 'Mr. Yu shares the same surname and is from the same province as I, yet I did not know him. Mr. Zou Lisheng obtained this book from among the remains of old books, and the ink was so faded that it was almost unrecognizable. He spent several years correcting and arranging it, hand-copying it into a finalized version. His wise son, Grand Secretary Jingshu, who is one of my students, showed it to me. I read it once and returned it to Jingshu, asking him to treasure it.'" The "Catalog" cites Yu Yue's text as the basis for its entry, as the original book had not yet been seen at the time. Later, at the Zhejiang Literature Exhibition held in Hangzhou, a manuscript of "The True Explanation of Investiture of the Gods" was displayed, borrowed from the collection of Zou Shilu of Haichang. The "Special Issue of the Zhejiang Literature Exhibition" also listed it in the catalog with a commentary. The original book has a preface by Yu Jing, written in the Yihai year of the Jiaqing reign (1815), stating that the book was written fifteen years earlier while teaching in the capital. There is also a preface by Zou Cungan (Chusheng) from the tenth year of the Guangxu reign (1884), stating that he obtained the handwritten manuscript of this book in the Bingchen year of the Xianfeng reign (1856) and revised it. Therefore, it is known that this version is no longer Yu's original. The book consists of ten volumes in six books. Zou's books were originally kept in Hangzhou and scattered in Shanghai after the war. A certain person in Beiping once obtained some of them, but it is unknown who possesses this "Illustrated Exposition of Investiture of the Gods."</p>

<p>Among the earliest collections of vernacular stories published during the Ming dynasty are the "Rainy Window Collection" and "Desire Pillow Collection" published by Qingping Mountain Hall, as well as fifteen stories published in Japan without an overall title. Mr. Dai Yu Shu and Mr. according to Gu Xiu's "Preliminary Bibliography of Assembled Books", "Six Family of Novels", and also got "Long Lantern Collection", "Follow Ship Collection", "Sister Leisure Collection", "Awakening Dream Collection" four names. Each type has ten volumes, and each volume has one chapter, for a total of sixty chapters. This is the total number of vernacular stories published by Hong Bian Qingping Mountain Hall.</p>
<p>I accidentally checked the Ming "Wenyuange Bibliography" and found two more types of vernacular stories collections in volume ten;</p>
