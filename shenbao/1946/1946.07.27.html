<h3>馬歇爾再登慮山謁主席商討時局　離京前並與宋周晤談</h3>
<p>〔本報牯嶺廿六日電〕馬歇爾特使今下午二時由京起飛，三時半抵潯，六時四十五分乘轎抵達牯嶺行館，黃總幹事仁霖特代表主席下山迎接，馬夫人亦乘轎赴小天池等候數分鐘後，馬帥轎到，夫人揮手相迎達三次之多，馬帥亦揮手爲禮、兩人見面後，握手甚歡。夫人提議下轎步行，邊走邊談。夫人即告馬帥曰，自君別後，此間連日下雨。並稱：我特地爲你在書房內預備二盞燈，如此你閱讀書報更加便利。夫人並將蔣夫人對渠招待執誠不時請渠赴行館同餐散步，並時往馬公館陪同進　等均一一相吿。馬師亦向夫人叙述途中經過，狀極欣慰，步至牯嶺街口、始乘轎逕返行館休息。</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺廿六日電〕馬帥今晚七時廿五分，在主席行轅與蔣主席談話卅五分鐘，當將共黨意見轉吿，並約定廿七晨九時繼續會談。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕政治商談序幕，今日在舉國戰火瀰漫中重啓，其切要主題自爲如何撲滅戰火，然迄至午夜止，就周恩來竟日分訪馬帥與司徒大使之談話內容以觀，仍顯示其充分之固執，且欲以不必要之所謂新的問題「如李聞被刺案」滲入，以阻撓問題之解決，馬帥此番返京，與司徒大使之遲滯赴平，均爲我國之和平，司徒大使曾堅信以其堅毅之宗敎精神，謀使此問題獲得正當解決，馬帥自亦願犧牲其家庭生活，以五十餘高齡、爲雙方竭力謀合。然馬帥今日仍不得不空手返　，而司徒大使仍以困惑情緒，滯留首都，實爲期待和平之全國人民所住焦慮萬端者。按周恩來今日晨十時廿分訪馬帥，談兩小時，復於七時半訪司徒大使，並同進晚餐，旋進行晤談，迄十時半始畢。據探悉：兩次談話內容，除偉戰問題外·曾滲入若干新枝節，即李聞被刺案等，以若干過去事件作引證，至使主要問題之檢討無法進行。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕馬帥今上午九時半、接見宋院長、晤談近一小時，內容不悉，唯據觀察家稱，可能爲轉逹政府方面之意見。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕司徒雷登大使，廿六日晨赴捷克等使館回拜，午後五時接見周恩來，北平之行將稍緩。</p>

<p>〔本報牯嶺廿五日訊〕此間普潤寺有尼宏修，原名舒立峯，爲一名慶問者之妻。廖爲湖南　陵人，現年四十六歲，先後充任軍職，七七事變發生，廖因公奔走各方，特囑舒暫留九江，不知廖一去即無音訊，舒所積錢財，均已吿　。孤苦零丁，即至　削髮爲尼。日前舒尼特挽人以其呈文轉達蔣夫人，闡述經過，並表示其本已脫離紅塵，但因九年來廖氏踪跡　然，不得不請求夫人援助，令有關機關探問。聞夫人閱呈後，即囑隨員辦理。</p>

<h3>平瀋直達通車下月中旬實現</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕平　直達通車，下月中旬始可實現，因關內外幣制不同，將來如何規定票價，平津鐵路局正候東北鐵路局派員來平商議後，始可決定。又路局爲便利北戴河避署，在北戴河設有鐵路賓館車站，與北戴河間且有汽車接送，往來極便。</p>

<h3>睢寗共軍潰退東竄　國軍進駐宿遷城　天長共軍增援戰況激烈</h3>
<p>〔本報鎮江廿六日電〕軍息，國軍確已收復睢寗，並於廿五日進駐宿遷，刻睢寗共軍已潰退東竄’狀極狼狽。</p>

<p>〔本報鎭江廿六日電〕高郵共軍連日調動頻繁，有由邵伯北調者，有由高郵南運者，惟大部均在黑夜沿運東西水路，以船隻拖送，但共軍南運往揚泰縣者，實較北運爲多，且仍有攻擊揚仙之誇大宣傳，刻郵邵綫已交通封鎖</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿六日電〕蘇北共軍因近週來節節敗退，有派小股向江南流竄，擾亂京滬綫企圖，駐　國軍五十七旅爲維持地方秩序，特於廿六日召開治安會議，激勵民衆，實行捍衛桑梓，以杜不良份子活動。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿六日電〕據揚州電話，共軍六個團廿六日竄擾大儀集甘泉山楊家廟一帶，並在楊家廟附近周圍趕築大規模工事，有大學進犯　州野心，以圖挽救揚泰公路之頹勢，而牽制國軍。</p>
<p>〔中央社徐州廿六日電〕揚州儀徽以北及天長以南地區，廿五日晨　被共軍猛烈攻擊，其由淮陰船運南下共軍，已有一部於高郵附近登陸，　向邵伯疾進，一部仍乘原船西經高郵湖向天長急駛中。至午國軍已將天長以南之共軍逐退至天長，並乘勢進至天長以東之仁和集附近，堵截向天長增援之共軍。嘉山國軍於擊潰來犯之共軍後已乘勢進至汶　鎭地區，堵正續由吁咍來犯之共軍，蒙城東北之板橋附近，發現共軍一部，　向蒙城進犯，已被國軍逐退。</p>
<h3>共黨歪曲宣傳無傷國軍毫末</h3>
<p>〔中央社如皋廿六日電〕駐防南通國軍經旬日之奮戰，卒將來犯共軍撃退，並於廿三日下午五時進入如皋城，乃共黨於共軍慘遭重創敗退以後，竟以其一貫造謠技倆，散布國軍第四十九師作戰失利，及王鐵漢師長被俘之　言，　欲企圖淆亂視聽，現事實證明擊潰共軍收稪如皋城者，即係共黨廣事宣傳業已被其殲潰之國軍第四十九師，而師長王鐵漢不僅並未被俘，反率部直搗共軍根據地之如皋，由此以證共黨之歪曲宣傳，固無傷國軍毫末，實足以暴露其所宣傳，毫無根據，不講慣實，欺騙國人。記者今晨到達如皋面晤王鐵漢師長，並以滬報所刋載共黨所散佈之謠言，叩詢王師長觀感，王師長一笑置之，並稱本師（指四十九師）全體官兵，許身革命，但知保國衛民，忠誠自守，義無反顧，共黨之比種造謠技倆，實足以證明其無恥耳。</p>

<h3>分割中國反對中央者全球應痛予斥責　紐約時報為美對華政策作辯</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿四日電〕紐約時報今日著論，駁斥外傳中美反動派企圖挑起中國作戰，並替美國最近之對華政策辯護。社評題名爲「吾人在中國之任務」，文中略云：蔣主席之國民政府爲唯一被承認之中國政府，而以戰時盟國資格獲得美國協助之保證，並根據中蘇條約，獲得蘇政府單獨之道義及軍事援助之特別保證，故任何抗議，不應指向該政府及其擁護者，而應痛斥反對該政府，及分割中國者，蘇對美經濟方面之指責。只需比較蘇對其他各國所加之統制截　政策，及美國和平保障之自由貿易及機會均等之門戶　放政策，即可見其指責之可笑，在中國最富庶之東北，欲求態斷與特　者，乃蘇聯非美國也。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿五日合衆電〕美國政策協會會員卅八人，頃要求國務院停止促使中國政府繼續對中國共產黨讓步之政策，渠等指責中國共產黨對中國及世界失信　約，並不斷努力欲變中國爲蘇聯之附庸。</p>
<h3>京滬路常州奔牛間共黨圖破壞鐵路　護路巡迴軍車出動防範</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕據交通界消息，昨晨十時左右，京滬路常州站附近，發現雜色服裝攜有步槍，手槍及快　　，手榴彈之大批共軍約三百人左右，結隊企圖破壞常州車站，同時離常州站九公里之奔牛站，亦發現同　共軍百餘人，經該　護路隊發現後，即通報各處護路部隊，立即增防，共軍見勢未能得手，即行　散竄逸。據確悉：離首都南京　區五公里之和平門車站月臺上，二十五日午夜發現手溜彈一枚，經該站護路警發現後，報吿駐站警務分段，當即設法移去，此手溜彈來自何處，何人置放，一時無從查悉。滬綫，因護路部隊防範嚴密，未能得手，故利用　小企圖破壊車站設備，藉此威脅旅客安全，而謀擾亂治安。</p>
<p>又息：京滬衛戍總司令湯恩伯氏，頃特令護路司令郭腹洲，加緊防範，籍防不測。郭氏奉令後即與路局商討，結果除在京滬滬杭路兩綫沿鐵路各站加緊防範外，昨復專撥火車一輛共計十節，乘坐官兵裝配大批武器，作爲護路巡迴車，于昨日起日夜川流往返京滬及滬杭綫各地，至路局警務處之裝甲車隊，亦隨時出動巡迴各站。</p>
<h3>江陰縣保安隊清剿零星共軍</h3>
<p>〔本報無錫廿六日電〕江陰息，澄南外花山於十六日上午十一時發現少數共軍，並隨意開槍示威，旋向峭岐而去，此項共軍係由西鄉越過錫澄公路　來，東鄉華墅亦有四十餘人，携有短槍，縣府已令保安隊下鄉淸剿，並令各鄉鎮防範。</p>
<p>〔本報江陰廿六日電〕南竄共軍，大都零星散股，潰不成軍，二十六日午後近郊花山綺山，亦有少數發現，向東南而去，沿途幷鳴槍示威。</p>
<h3>共軍毒辣計劃又決洪湖堤</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕據息：蘇北共軍近擬有一殘暴不仁之計劃，如蘇北戰事全盤失利，即將決毁洪澤湖畔高家　及沿運河之豆瓣集，劉老澗等地之堤岸，用以泛濫蘇北以東二十餘縣及兩淮諸縣。聞共軍現已在各該地强征民夫，準備隨時掘挖。按蘇北有一俗道：「倒了高家堰，淮揚不見面」，可見水勢之大，爲害之烈。</p>
<h3>中訓團教育長由黃杰代理</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕中央訓練敎育長原由陳誠兼任，陳氏現改任該團副團長，所遺敎育長一職，前曾發表薛岳担任，旋薛改任徐州綏署主任，未能到職，國府頃發表黃杰將軍代理。</p>
<h3>平行轅舉行茶會邀中委交換意見</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕北平行轅今日下午七時，邀集在平中委茶話，交換目前時局意見，晚七聚時餐。談話內容尚不悉·</p>
<h3>李敏然晤杜聿明會談如順利可望獲協議　李氏謂將使「和平路綫」有成</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽廿六日電〕林彪代表李敏然抵瀋後。極爲、一般人所注意。廿六晨軍調蔡組長陪同晉謁杜長官，長談三小時，至十二時一刻始辭出。聞杜　本政府意向，說明對東北狀態之意見，李亦將林氏之意見提出。聞雙方所提出者距離頗遠，故一時尚難達於一般人所期望者。據李氏語記者：對杜長官之開誠相見，殊堪欽佩，互相瞭解意見之所在，當有助於問題之商談。記者詢以是否將再謁杜氏，李謂有此可能。至詢以林彪意見如何？李謂尚未至發表時期云消息靈通人士認李此來係代林敷衍塲面，因林前未至長赴約，故出此舉是以東北間題，仍有待於南京整個之酌商也</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕此間有力當局對李立三訪問長瀋，認爲無足重視，因和戰大計，決於京廬，而非決於長瀋也。某重要官員且指出李立三訪問長瀋，其目的在「想於長瀋辦新華日報」，但一般言之，目前東北局勢確屬和緩，原因爲共軍於四平街一役後，主力損失極大，亟須相當時日補充整理，始能言戰，而國軍方面，於勝利之後，亦須對收復區域及補給等加以　固，故江漢之間雖烽火燎原，而東北尚能短期呈粗安之局也。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿六日電〕綜合各方消息，林彪代表李立三瀋陽之行，並非如其初到長春時所說，乃純爲答拜性質，如與杜聿明會談順利，可能謀得下列問題之全部或個別協議，即（一）延長東北之局部和平，（二）九月底前逍竣共區日俘，（三）沿松花江北岸劃緩衝地帶之再商談，（四）共軍勿破壊小豐滿向瀋送電。李由長赴瀋，行前稱，彼來時已有百分之五十以上把握，會晤社長官後，加至百分之百。杜聿明昨送後勤總部副司令陳良來平，在機塲亦曾表示目前東北無大衝突，願以極大誠意，與李坦白晤談，期以此次會晤而減少若干誤解與衝突，但謂大局之打開，仍有待於南京。並指出共軍在東北各地之積極調動，予和平以阻碍。上舉數問題，以這俘僑易解決，政府對此己擬有成案，派有俘僑管理處人往洽，向瀋輸電，共方人已派員赴沿綫視察，短期內可修復電路，今日之李敏然，似與過去之李立三判若兩人，彼亦曾笑語人曰：「過去之李立三路綫雖錯誤，而今後之李敏然的和平路綫，吾當盡力使之有成。」司徒雷登大使〇於廿五日謁陵後在陵前攝影（中央社攝）</p>

<h3>巴勒斯坦的前途</h3>
<p>巴基斯坦這幾天在恐怖空氣的籠罩中，本月二十二日聖城耶路撒冷的英軍司令部「在衛王旅館」被炸，死傷失蹤者幾達一百五十人。據英首相艾德禮宣告。而猶太地下組織伊爾根黨，廿三日且向當地記者宣布，承認此舉是他們所爲。就英政府廿四日所發表的白皮書來看，可知猶太激烈份子的暴行，自去秋以來，始終不斷，其目的顯然在強迫英政府不得採取與猶太人相反之政策。因此，我們敢斷言，巴基斯坦猶太人和阿拉伯人的爭執，究將如何解決，實在是英國在二次世界大戰以後最感困擾的問題中之一個。</p>
<p>巴基斯坦在第一次世界大戰後，原爲英國的委任統治地，但自從此次戰後經過英美聯合調查團的報告，建議先移十萬猶太人到巴基斯坦，英國就很聰明的拉住了美國，想要美國來爲她撐腰，共同解決這個難題。而窺英國人的內心，也許正如英國報界方面所稱，巴基斯坦或將分爲阿刺伯與猶太兩幫，由一中央行政機關管轄，其方式與印度相仿。這自然是英國最稱心的如意算盤。但據耶路撒冷傳來的電訊，阿刺伯族固堅決反對分治巴基斯坦的計劃，認爲事實上在此狹小的土地內成立互相仇視的兩國，絕不可能，即猶太人也未嘗不想仗了的力量完全回到老家去復國。英國要想兩面討好，也許遭到雙方的見怪。</p>
<p>戰後英國對於一般屬地問題，都將感到頭痛而棘手，而巴基斯坦的問題未必較印度問題爲易於解決。印度雖然有印度族與回族的衝突，但是印回的衝突表面上使英國統治困難，實際上或反使英國統治方便。因爲假如印回合作，一致要求獨立，那麽英國政府就沒有理由再干涉印度的政治。現在英國雖然名義上答應印度獨立，實際上卻不能撤兵，因爲英國軍隊對外要替印度建設國防，對內要維持秩序。就是政治方面，印回一日不能合作，印度一天也就離不了英國的統治，所以英國在印度的勢力，實際就是建築在印度內部的矛盾上面。</p>
<p>在巴基斯坦，情形就與印度大不相同。巴基斯坦原來是猶太人的地方。在羅馬時代，猶太人被羅馬人驅逐出境；到十六世紀初葉，阿拉伯人佔領巴基斯坦，一直到今天。第一次大戰以後，在一九二二年行政院批准英國委任統治條款以後，猶太人方纔逐漸返回故土。但是猶太人最善經營，在任何的國家，只要猶太人到來，經過很短的的時間，他們就能夠把握當地很大的財力，在美、德、英、蘇、法過去都是如此，阿刺伯人自忖當然不是他們的敵手。阿刺伯人埋怨猶太人買了他們的大批的土地，使他們沒有生活的工具，這也是實情。從一九二二年到這次大戰結束，阿猶兩族的衝突逐漸增高。阿刺伯人最希望的兩件事，第一是要求英國撤退，成立阿刺伯人的巴基斯坦獨立國，第二禁止猶太人入境。但是去年英美　聯合調查國的報告書既主張在一九四六年內准許猶太人十萬名入境，又主張英國繼續委任統制；這剛好和阿刺伯人的志願相反。於是排猶運動風起雲湧；而猶太人也採取恐怖行動來對付。事情越鬧越兇，幾乎到了不可收拾的地步，而英國忽然又不支持猶太人，外相貝文且公然聲稱不預備就幫助十萬猶太人移入巴基斯坦，反而大批逮捕猶太恐怖份子下獄，於是猶太人也起而反英；英國政府真感到兩面不討好。</p>
<p>英國的地位是很苦惱的。她曾經允許猶太人復國，她同時又曾經答應阿刺伯人統一。這兩個諾言顯然是矛盾的，衝突的，決沒有同時實踐的可能。依照英國傳統的勢力均衡政策，當然最理想的就是「分而治之」（Divide　and　rule），讓阿猶兩族勢均力敵，由英國人操縱統治，就像工英國在印度對付回印兩族一樣。但是現在這個辦法很難實行了。阿刺伯人內部是統一的，態度是堅決的，甚至埃及、敘利亞、外約但、伊拉克、伊朗、沙地阿拉伯、黎巴嫩、及葉門等阿拉伯國家，巳聯合要求聯合國大會於九月間討論巴基斯坦問題，英國已經感覺其不可侮，所以想造就阿刺伯人暫時不讓猶太人入境；同時，猶太人歸返祖國，名正言順，加上在各國的猶太人羣爲後援，英國也沒有辦法出爾反爾，收回成命。</p>
<p>在這個僵局蹭，英國人想出兩個辦法來。第一是想請美國駐兵巴基斯坦，保護猶太人入境，因爲杜魯門總統以爲十萬猶太人移入巴基斯坦的諾言自應實踐，不過英國的提議，明明是嫁禍於美國，本來美國並不想統治巴基斯坦，她又何必派兵去惹起糾紛呢？英國第二個辦法，就是現分治巴基斯坦的辦法。依照這個辦法，猶回分成兩個聯幫，在阿刺伯聯邦裏，猶太人不得購買土地，這樣可使阿刺伯人生活有了保障。猶太人也許可能贊成這個辦法，但阿刺伯人已經宣怖不願意了。一個民族的財富不完全是土地，就算猶太人不買土地，將來全國財富大部分仍將會集中在他們手裏。阿刺伯人當然明白，所以不肯承認分治。同時，阿拉伯人要求的是要獨立，猶太人要求的也是要獨立，他們都不願意接受英國人的統治，因爲他們已經不大信任英國人了。此在英國，自然更覺苦悶。英國在中東的勢力，因爲英軍巳撤出伊朗，敘利亞，黎巴嫩，也許還要撤出埃及，再加上巴基斯坦的撤退，將來就會完全塌台，而蘇彜士運河的控制，再也不可能了。</p>
<p>但是平心而論，民革的猶回兩族現在都走極端，雙方都在想達到不可能的目的。猶太人要阿刺伯人讓他們自由移民發展，一琿是辦不到的：阿刺伯人要完全排斥猶太人也是辦不到的。兩族都要爭這巴基斯坦一塊地方，而兩族都沒有其他的出路。如果真想解決這個相持不下的僵局，也許分治而各自獨立，或許反是一個差強人意的辦法。不然，彼此斗爭到你死我亡，就算英軍撤退，而他日依然不能倖存，前門拒虎，後門進狼，也未必能有什麽更好的前途。他們應該知道：任何民族，假如內部不能統一，要建設一個真正的獨立國家，一定還是很遙遠的。其實，這真理豈獨巴基斯坦的猶太人阿拉伯人應該知道，世界上任何民族都應當有此驚覺！</p>
<h3>關於糖價問題　政府公布真相（續）</h3>
<p>台灣糖業公司成立以後，除整理廠房設備籌劃規復外，並接到日人原有存糖約十五萬噸。該項存糖，公司奉命依照敵僞産業處理辦法，在滬出售，全數售出後，約可得價款國幣二千餘億元，除少數運輸費用外，當悉數繳國庫，該公司自一月二十四日開始發售以來，現巳除存中央銀行專戶者，巳有九十億元左右。</p>
<p>該公司營業方針，經由資委會確立二點：（一）除大量用戶及消費合作社直接配售外，採取躉售方法售於糖行，不做零售業務；（二）定價必低於市價，以收平抑物價之效。</p>
<p>該公司於成立之初，本擬於一月份起每月由台運滬砂糖萬噸，但事實上因運輸困難，一月份內僅運到四千五百噸，六月份內僅運到一千五百噸，遠較預定數量爲少，該公司於五月二十四日卅日及六月六日出售砂糖三批，計三千三百噸，再加較白砂糖三百噸，合計三千六百噸，躉售價均爲六萬六千元，第三批爲六萬六千五百元（一二兩批在浦東交貨，第三批在浦西交貨，故加水腳五百元，事實上躉售價仍爲六萬六千元。）五月廿四日以前市價每市担，即爲七萬元左右，公司售糖以後，迄至六月六日止，市價始騬在七萬元左右，極爲平衡。六月以後，糖商察知公司存貨不豐，市價逐步擡高至每市担八萬元以上，六月十四日第四期售糖時，糖商申購數竟達中四千五百噸，超出以往一二三期第期申購數三倍以上，公司以存貨不足供應，因擬定依照一二三期各糖商配售額比例核減售出九百噸，在第三期配售以後所成立之糖行暫不售給，此項辦法　糖業公會表示贊同定價因市價巳八萬一千元，故亦略爲增加改爲七萬三千元，蓋如公司仍照原價發售，市民仍須照　市價購得食糖，不能得到實惠，徒使政府延受不必要之損失，而糖商則獲利過份之利潤。</p>
<p>該公司一方面因存糖不足，一方面因市價巳趨過十萬元，深恐定價太低，不僅坐使糖商獲利暴利，並處存貨或將全部爲糖商購罄，則市塲將無法控制，故不得巳於六月廿日廿一日廿二日三日直接在市塲抛售七百噸，價爲九萬八千元。廿三日獲台灣電稱，台糖裝船巳有確期，各方需要仍殷，乃將現貨悉數售出，並預售期貨三千噸，價爲九萬五千元，而市塲價格則現貨漲至十二萬三千元。綜上所述，　該公司出售食糖辦法，除大量戶爲糖果公司及消費合作直接供售外，餘均係躉售，而糖商購糖並較直接購買之大量用戶爲優惠，公司並指定專人代辦稅照手續，以利轉售，糖商利益實極優厚；　該公司第四期售糖減少，純爲存貨不豐；　該公司直接抛售係臨時應急辦法，因存底巳少，如不將售價酌提，存貨有悉數售罄之虞市塲漲風更難抑止；　此次市塲糖價突增，乃洞悉存底情形，因而發生特殊波動。</p>
<p>處理辦法</p>
<p>依據此次調查結果，認爲台灣糖業公司原訂售糖辦法，大體尚屬妥善，但市價上漲時，該公司未能即採有效辦法，商請地方當局設法抑止，未免疏忽，而該公司抛售糖價，雖較市價爲低，仍未免追隨市價，亦有未當，至於運輸阻滯，更爲此次市價波動之內在原因，爲求解決目前及將來困難起見，擬具處理辦法如次：　改善航運狀況，務期達到每月能由台運糖一萬噸至滬之目的；　台灣糖業公司售糖，應以價格爲主要目的，宜將目前市價逐步抑低，並經決定最近配售之價，減爲八萬元，但爲防止市塲擡價起見，擬由院令飭上海市政府社會局切實限制零售價格，以後該公司並應每星期定額供售一次，各糖行分配數量，似可責成糖業公會代爲審核，公司按期將每次售價及各方分配數量在報章公布，以昭信實；此外，並得視市價漲跌隨時配售，以期穩定市價；　爲期卅七年産糖達到卅萬噸起見，本年夏季必須擴大，種蔗面積，台灣長官公署早於六月十日約集台灣公司及蔗農代表集議，鼓勵植蔗辦法，並定本年七八九三個月內積極推動；　台糖公司原有少數台灣民股，最近三五年內爲建設時期，業務不易獲利，但至機器修復以後，則當爲有利之事業，屆時似家吸收較多之民股，使人民能共享其利，亦可以收回一部份政府之投資。（完）</p>

<h3>國際法庭繼續傳訊證人　南京大屠殺案暴露　日寇施獸行慘絕從寰　平民死難達二十萬衆</h3>
<p>〔社東京廿六日電〕遠東國際法庭今日繼續開庭，許傳晉博士出庭作證，敘述日軍在南京之暴行。略謂，一九三七年南京淪陷後，日寇逞其暴行，平民被殺者達二十萬人以上。死難之婦女及受傷之人不計其數，房屋被恣意破壞或焚燒，路見中國平民，即加殺戮，凡在軍役年齡之人均被帶走，遭信團槍殺或焚斃。</p>
<p>〔改造社東京廿六日電〕遠東國際法庭今日開庭審訊南京大屠殺慘案，首席檢察官季楠今日復出現於法庭。今日首由檢察官薩東繼昨日直接訊問證人威爾森，南京城陷後，鴉片之買賣有無增減。證人答謂，日軍占南京後，公開出售鴉片之處驟形增加，復以吸菸所爲例，說明南京之治安，如何爲日軍所破壞。繼由被告武藤之辯護之岡本，就南京失守時之醫院情形，略作訊問後，即由當時縱容總政屬殺之日酋松井辯護人伊藤起立作反訊問。伊藤謂昨日證人曾謂某中國婦女遭日軍強姦後，逾兩月即呈梅毒第二期病狀，然由本人之研究，梅毒第二期之症狀，須於三個月後始行呈現，故該婦人並非日兵所強姦云云。然因伊藤之質問並無根據，威爾森即行退庭。繼由我政府選定來日作證之許傳音氏出庭，許氏以流暢之英語，先陳述其履歷，謂金陵大學畢業後，即赴美入伊利諾亞大學，歸國後服務於鐵路事業，今年六十二歲，繼即以清晰有力之聲調陳述當時日軍之屠殺情形稱，日人極爲野蠻，見人即射擊，凡行於街上者，自窗間窺視者，企圖逃出者莫不加以射擊。</p>
<h3>姦淫擄掠無所不爲　目擊街頭陳屍纍纍</h3>
<p>日兵對婦女之行爲，實非文明世界所能想像。余目睹一婦女在浴室受辱，裸身而泣。一日，余往某友人家見十一人被殺，十四歲及十一歲女子在台上被辱，台上血痕淋漓。一家族甫欲乘船濟河，日兵突來檢查見年輕婦女兩人，即在其雙親及丈夫前加以獸行。又日軍對任何私人財産，均不中以尊重，彼隨意闖入人家，隨意携去物品，繼即放火燒燬房屋。日軍入城三日之後，余得日軍許可，至街上探視，見死屍到處縱橫藉，或被斬碎，或以被殺時姿勢橫陳路上，亦曾目擊日兵殺人，余曾數某路上死屍，數達五百具，至此實不忍再數矣。</p>
<p>搜收容收</p>
<p>檢察官繼東至此改變訊問方法，爲證明日軍如何作有組織之殺戮工作起見，乃訊問南京安全地區國際救濟委員會情形。許氏答稱，國救濟委員會曾收容無家可歸之難民二十萬至三十萬人，當時規定持有武器者，絕對不得入該收容所，然十二月十四日晨八時日軍高級將校竟行闖入，謂中國兵隱匿安全區，故來搜查，余及外國職員均答謂，安全區並無一中國兵，然日兵翌日又來，欲捕去安全區內中國人。某次，日兵來安全區捕去中國人千五百人，翌日國際救濟委員會附近忽聞機槍聲，派人往視，知此等中國人巳被殺矣。</p>
<p>脅迫行禮</p>
<p>一九三八年元旦中午，曾見日兵縱爲燒蘇聯使館，青年會及其他要人房屋亦相繼被焚。日兵尤其是步哨，強迫全市人民向之低頭行禮，余亦爲被此種行爲，繼續至停戰爲止，此等日軍之態度，在余所歷訪各都市（安徽省內二百哩地位）均曾目擊。（問）商業上亦對中國人加以限制否？（答）余嘗以船載木炭赴南京，得日本特務機關所雇中國人特務員許可，其理由係因余分商業利益與彼等。</p>

<h3>荷海軍砲轟爪哇　東印組合衆國協商中</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴達維亞廿五日電〕荷蘭海軍當局正式承認該國軍艦在爪哇東部外南夢港外，向爪哇開砲轟擊。據荷海軍軍官談稱：詢諸在荅里港登陸之爪哇恐怖份子，獲悉外南夢爲爪哇份子之活動根據地，夜間有武裝份子多人，自此渡過荅里海峽，荷海軍司令部聞訊後，不得不立即採取行動。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴達給亞廿五日電〕荷蘭與東印度代表在西里伯島馬里諾談判，今日巳將結束，顯巳商定組織印尼合衆國，爲將來東印度獨立之基礎。東印度各部代表除爪哇及蘇門答臘外，均參加會議，巳決定印尼合衆國由爪哇、蘇門答臘、婆羅州及「大東」組成，所謂大東區，係指婆羅州、東方東印所屬各地。各項協議當於九月間在海牙再行會議，作最後決定。</p>

<h3>死圈半徑廣半哩　原子彈屢試結果證明　威力可怖相待炸藥五萬噸</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿六日廣播：原子彈試驗司令白朗第將軍今日經半小時之視察後稱：如真正戰爭中以原子彈五枚轟炸敵方艦隊，則艦員之死傷將極嚴重。此次試驗結果，發現炸力將水抛擲空中之力量，遠較預計者爲大，試驗艦上之動物情形如何，目前尚無報告，但如有未死者，則艦上預置有食物及飲料，足供彼等十日之用。</p>
<p>〔聯合社比基尼廿六日電〕原子彈巳兩度確切證明能毀滅周圍半哩內之各種船隻。昨在比基尼作淺水試驗時，各靶子船上若有船員，則在甲板上者或巳悉數喪生。此乃原子彈試驗司令白朗第海軍中將之審慎判斷。昨日之試驗散怖極多之輻射能，致爆炸廿四小時後卅六萬哩內海水仍含輻射能。七月一日在此島試驗原子彈空中爆炸，及去年在新墨西哥州沙地試驗原子彈錄得之「暴斃」半徑，亦係半哩。比基尼兩度試驗，在此半徑內之艦船，無一倖存。據空中觀察員報告：就浮筒之早先地位觀之，潛入水中之潛艇六艘，似巳有五艘沉沒，惟白朗第謂未能確定。</p>
<p>總指揮官發表報告</p>
<p>昨日各艦甲板下若有船員，多數亦巳因「爆炸時身受震動」而負傷。此外，　爆炸中，炸彈上空六千呎，有無人飛機一架，亦被爆炸力隔水層炸壞。　此次試驗所用炸彈，與用於長崎者力量大致相待。　運輸船及其他較輕船隻所以沉沒不多者，乃因距離爆炸中心較遠之故。白氏又切言原子彈引起之浪潮，不容忽視，此次試驗曾引起十二次浪潮，其高雖不出十呎，然比基尼海灘上登陸艇一艘竟被浪潮擊沉。</p>
<p>〔聯合社比基尼廿六日電〕淺水原子彈靶子艦隊，昨夜並無沉沒者，其巳於礁湖底之正式數安，仍爲十艘。礁湖上空及艦隊周圍，仍有輻射綫籠罩，迄尚不克接近。科學家預料：此次爆炸僅能殺死少數魚類。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社哥倫比亞京城廿六日電〕此間與紐約間無綫電交通，今日突被神秘之大氣所阻礙。一般人相信此種阻隔觀象，乃比基尼原子彈爆炸之結果。</p>
<p>白鳥無恙　湖魚遭殃</p>
<p>〔中央社比基尼廿五日合衆電〕據目睹者稱：此次原子能之爆炸力量極大。另據觀睹四次原子彈爆炸之「紐約時報」著名道學記者勞倫斯稱：今日之爆炸力量，相當於黃色炸藥五萬噸；此種力量足以夷平城市中十方哩之區域，約當以前所公布之廣島爆炸力量之兩個半。原子能之爆炸有二特點：　今後之作戰艦隊，再無須自海面對敵艦射擊以消滅之。　能使海水變爲較酸類更可怖，乃放出放射性之雨更爲無用之死水，並使其自天空冲擊海岸綫後若幹哩之區域。今日舉行水底爆炸兩小時以後，百萬尾死魚飄浮水面，僅有倖存之白鳥翺翔於珊瑚叢輿之上。爆炸三小時後，由其他艦機以無綫電採縱之黃色巡邏艇駛入礁湖，以收取帶有放射性之水及空氣之樣本。白朗第中將謂：冲擊三哩半，遠比基尼無人跡之珊瑚海灘之海浪，其高度約爲七至十呎。又礁湖上所浮綠色廢渣，證明原子彈將珊瑚質之湖底炸陷。</p>
<p>主角小艇　瞬即毀滅</p>
<p>〔聯合社麥金萊號旗艦廿五日電〕原子彈試驗主角船，即中型登陸艇第六十號，今日初露色相，該船於一秒鍾內分裂，旋即完全毀滅。此船乃試驗艦隊中最重要之一艘，按原子炸彈即繋於該船底下。艇內並載有最重要之電子配備，爲以前所未有。</p>
<p>〔聯合社原子彈試驗參觀艦阿派拉欽號上廿五日電〕第一顆水面下原子炸彈爆炸，對於比基尼礁湖內靶子艦之破壞程度，仍待確定。目前所知者，軍艦十艘，巳沉沒海底。另有軍艦六艘，則均受創。科學家及海軍人員乘觀察船於爆炸後九小時內駛入礁湖。在靶子艦「冷透」至調查團可上云時爲止，約尚須經三五日之久。三十哩前綫之云層，沾染分裂之微粒，冉冉向西北方飄去。</p>
<h3>義阿兩廢王　流亡埃境　不堪回首</h3>
<p>〔路透社亞曆山大里亞廿五日電〕在此亞曆山大大帝所建之古城內，居有歐洲之兩位流亡國王，一乃前阿爾巴尼亞王索格，一爲前義王愛麥虞限。兩人在此從不晤面，即使晤面亦不交談。當墨索里尼之軍隊於一九三九年四月佔領阿爾巴尼亞後，索格王被迫出亡，愛麥虞限乃獲意大利及阿爾巴尼亞國王之號。愛麥虞限今巳波蘭索伯爵，偕前後埃蘭那居於安多尼亞特宮內。渠最喜作戶外遊，常偕妻出外捕魚，或獵取野鴨。前阿爾巴尼亞王索格居於距海不遠之別墅內，平日深居簡出，僅偶於早晨至海濱散步而巳。</p>

<h3>英美完成談判　兩項計劃送議府研究</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿六日廣播：英美巳就和斯但問題，完成其談判，日內將發表聲明。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿五日電〕英外部今晚雖拒絕說明如今阿猶領袖會議之目的，但聞此與英國對阿拉伯聯盟之保證相符合，即未與阿拉伯人及猶太人諮詢之前，十萬猶太人移殖問題，絕不能作何決定。據阿拉伯方面消息，英美調查委會巳就巴基斯坦劃分四猶太人與阿拉伯人兩區計劃，成立切實協定。兩邦均有充分自主權，但公共事業及防務，應由委統國保留。據華盛頓消息，國務院發言人宣布國務卿貝爾納斯己收到兩項計劃，作爲處理巴基斯局勢之參考辦法。貝氏尚無暇閱讀，惟貝氏在廿七日啓程赴巴黎前，殆將與杜魯門總統討論及之。</p>

<h3>白畫鬧市發生綁案　十四小時破獲綁匪帶肉票游宴　糖商薛劍秋一場虛驚主犯章裕燦供曾任「司令」</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕九江路四川南路附近，中區熱鬧塲中，前晨竟發生一携人綁架案。被綁者爲閩人業糖商之薛劍秋，幸市警局警員澈夜辛勤，卒於十四小時內破案，並起獲肉票，主從犯四人就逮。茲將斯案經過，詳誌於次：</p>
<p>綁架</p>
<p>薛劍秋三十三歲，福建人，僦居虹口　　九十九號，業糖。前晨（廿四日）九時三十分許，薛至九江路四川中路行政　上海市房屋分區委員會訪友外出，正　至二樓扶梯　，不意預伏有綁匪二人，瞥見其下樓，即出槍威退，禁止聲張，抉登覆來之三輪車二輛逃逸。比至是日下午二時許，匪方致一電話（號碼爲四二三〇九號）轉與薛宅通話。當向薛妻薛徐沛霖（廿七歲沛縣人）謂：薛先生犯有漢奸嫌疑，業已査扣，如欲了事，須出資二千萬元等語。</p>
<p>電約</p>
<p>並約五時許着薛徐沛霖至西藏路天宮劇院門首接洽。指定來時須穿香靈紗旗袍爲標識·薛徐沛霖驟聆斯語，驚惶失措。屆時乃應約前往，直至六時左右未見一人，祗有一上身着西裝襯衫，下穿格子紡褲子，手中挾一雨衣之男子，偕一大塊頭穿香雲紗衫褲者竊竊私語，徘徊良久始去。迨返寓後未幾，其夫劍秋來電云，「趕速籌措二千萬，現下身體安好。」晚間八時許，薛徐沛霖乃偕友人投報市警局。當由刑事處張處長飭刑二課課長　俊厚漏夜偵査並派女警朱麗英化裝佇候於薛宅，竊聽電話，找尋綫索。</p>
<p>是晚十一時許，匪方又來電話稱：「款項有否籌齊，須在明午十二時前備妥，否則薛劍秋性命堪虞。」並約於翌晨十時在新成分局門口交款，惟需要金條和美鈔折合，不要法幣。當塲由薛妻處與委蛇，允謂正在吿貸中，比至昨晨九時半，忽又接一電話，改在南京中路起士林咖啡館樓上，並命迎去。</p>
<p>佈綱</p>
<p>其時警局得訊，當由　課長馮起山股長等預先趕往怖置各員警並化裝侍役車夫等候，一部分則佯作顧客進食早點。</p>
<p>逾半小時左右，薛妻單獨雇坐三輪車趕往起士林，當抵門口時，有預立於跑馬廳路側之一人身服白紡綢衫褲者，尾隨於後，相繼登樓，甫至樓梯上層，見顧客滿座，即匆匆而下，赴比鄰金門飯店七〇三號房間一轉，遂即外出。化裝之警員此時察覺其可疑，還暗隨不捨，朝東行至西藏路皇后滬劇社南首三九九號中興皮件號門首，當經馮股長等奮勇上前將其挾住，擠　該號內，詢其肉票藏於何處，其人祇供名　叶舟，其餘矢口否認，當即帶回警局收押，一面仍趕回起士林，以觀動靜。</p>
<p>少頃，果又來一電話，指明要薛太太聽話，邀其至新成分局門首，有人接洽。當時由　課長安慰其放心前去，該處四周亦已佈置就緒，薛妻有恃無恐，乃步行前去，同時　課長等亦遠遠跟隨，未及數武，至馬霍路時，忽有一輛三輪車飛駛到來，正靠近薛妻身邊，車上一乘客邀其登車，薛妻雖驚惶不已，但仍假作鎭靜，允即登車，由該人授予紙條一張，係薛劍秋所缮，上書「跟來人帶來見我切切。」斯時　課長等三人亦各雇三輪車一輛，尾隨而行，至成都路口，前車折向南行，過新成分局至威海衛路，越重慶路抵馬霍路。</p>
<p>擒匪</p>
<p>時警員等四顧無人命警長白文啓爾前截住，將期捕獲，拽至附近一弄內，命其招出肉票的藏所處，據稱，名章裕燦，又名西夫，諸曁人，住金門飯店七〇三號，曾任浙東游擊司令，實係一主犯。未謂肉票藏在河南路某機關大廈中，遂向附近安泰車行　坐出差汽車，押回警局後，由原辦人員至上述地點，將肉票薛劍秋救出，幷將君票匪徒張振源（廿五歲寗波人）拘獲。據張稱，昔日曾爲軍之副官，住新世界飯店二四〇號，後警員馳往該飯店守候，未幾，有從犯高振宇者到來，亦一併擒住，並抄出　餘士兵分隊長符號一張。</p>
<p>據薛稱，當被架走後，由匪同至南京西路美華酒家吃早點，中午至同路五味　中膳，食舉至華安理髮館理髮，傍晚至金魚飯店晚餐，胃稱新成分局警員許某簽字而出，折至仙樂斯舞廳跳舞，比至舞興闌珊，復往水上飯店宵夜。是日共用去法幣十八萬，將薛之鑽戒金錶售去化用，窮一日之歡，直至午夜始被藏於此巨　匪窟中。斯案由被綁至出綁，僅費十四小時，警局各警員辦案神速，可見一斑。</p>
<h3>麻瘋患者之厄運！　器材缺專家無　病院重建少經費　麻瘋救濟會昨年會報告</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕可怕的麻瘋病，至今仍蔓延世界各地，但我國麻瘋患者數目特多。據醫藥界約略估計，我國麻瘋病人達一百萬人，但治療麻瘋之專家，並無一個。在美國麻瘋患者不過五六百人，而麻瘋治療專家却有數十人。中華麻瘋救濟會成立以來，對治療我國麻瘋病人及撲滅麻瘋的工作，都盡過最大努力，但抗戰期中該會上海麻瘋院（在大塲）毁於砲火，醫藥器材又受限制，一度陷於極困難狀態中。那時上海臨時麻瘋院的死亡率達百分之十九，勝利後，麻瘋救濟會總會自渝遷滬，麻瘋院方面亦得國外之藥品接濟，死亡率乃减爲百分之二。唯該會正式麻瘋院之重建，仍極困難。　據四個月前之佔價，重建費用須十三萬萬元。以上報導是記者昨日在麻瘋救濟會本年度年會中所得。該會於昨下午在滬舉行一九四六年年會，由姚賢揚牧師，刁信德醫師等主持，此外並有外籍會員多人亦出席。大會除報吿總會在戰時的困苦情形外，並選舉　監事。又悉：該會上海臨時麻瘋院現有病人五十一名，彼等除經採用大　子油注射外，新近並採用美國新發明Promin針藥注射，但此藥效用尚在　　期中。</p>

<h3>黨國元老褚輔成氏痛論目前絲繭危機　絲廠業擬具救濟辦法兩項</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕黨國元老褚輔成氏，最近　選爲第三區繅絲工業同業公會理事長，該會會員，包括蘇·浙·皖三省及京·滬兩市所有繅絲工廠，機構龐大，實爲國內繅絲工業界唯一之集團組織。本報記者昨特訪褚氏於其寓邸，叩詢絲業現狀。褚氏以剴切之語調吿記者稱：目前我國絲業，已面臨嚴重關頭。而　農養　產滿結果，亦多　本。目前改良蠶種之市價，每張已逾二萬元。喂蠶之桑葉，最高價每擔亦達二萬餘元，依估計改良蠶種每張約可產乾繭六七十斤，而每張蠶種，須耗桑葉七八擔。</p>
<p>蠶農每擔成本二十萬元</p>
<p>依此比例計算，蠶農產乾繭一擔，成本約爲二十萬元。茲者改良蠶種之乾繭收買價，最高每擔不過十五萬元，故蠶農均感虧本不貲，以廠絲而言，目前出口至美國銷售之我國中等廠絲，其價格每擔約爲二百一二十萬元。惟目前繅製廠絲一擔之成本，繭本已佔二百萬元，繅工連折息耗損，約佔一百五十萬元。故廠絲每擔成本，已達三百五十萬元。</p>
<p>廠商每擔須虧百五十萬</p>
<p>與目前廠絲市價相較，每擔勢須虧蝕一百四五十萬元，又此次春繭貸款，得款廠商本身，須塡三成底本，方能貸取七成借款。如照目前廠絲市價削售，則即使耗盡此三成底本，尚不足以補償虧蝕於萬一，何能更談出口競爭，茲各絲廠以深感當前危機重重。</p>
<p>已推定代表向政府請願</p>
<p>故已決定推派冷禦秋等代表本會，會同中國蠶絲公司當局，擬具意見，晋京向行政院，經濟部，農林部等，請求救濟。現聞絲廠業方面，對於救濟辦法，擬具意見兩點：（一）各絲廠已繅就之廠絲，由政府統籌收買，然後設法外銷出口。（二）由各絲廠自行設法接洽外銷，而政府則輔以津貼出口辦法。褚氏復稱：亟望政府能於本月底以前，對救濟辦法，有確切之規定，俾使各廠商能於下月初，開始籌備收買秋繭。</p>
<p>不迅速救濟將影響秋繭</p>
<p>否則，救濟法不定，廠商已繅之絲，尚無法解決，　論收買秋繭。影響所及，九月初旬上市之秋蠶，將無蠶農願意殖養，故速定救濟辦法，已爲當務之急云。</p>
<h3>金價驟小　受香港金市影響</h3>
<p>烚赤昨突怯落，證券大戶開出即有斬售，自晨開一九四萬五，逐漸退落至一九二萬光景，始稍見穩，十時後中央配出一一一條，價一九二萬七五，此後求供有限，始終在一九三萬左右，近午稍升至一九三萬五，午後港電報來，金價慘跌，廣幫急切供售，期交亦跌至一八八萬五左右，結果較前收下跌六萬，飾金掛念萬〇三，紋銀銀元均平，暗拆已平，息價自一角零五至一角四分不等。</p>
<p>外幣美平英堅，美鈔晨初在二五三〇元左右，入後金市不振，繼續微降至二五一〇元左右，午刻稍穩，午後受金價下落所打擊，退至二四八〇元以下而後稍回，結果較前收下跌四十五元，港票由堅而疲，結果亦跌五元，港匯亦初高後跌，最後約五五〇元至五五五元，印匯英匯均無特變，美匯掛牌平而對做仍少。</p>
<h3>債市過程平庸統內繼續下降</h3>
<p>公債昨統丙仍有浮多了結，難有起色，業外人對雜牌甲乙仍有吸收，反稍見穩，交易不多，過程平庸，統丙晨開繼續下游，退至七〇〇元以下，始有維持，最後在七二〇元光景盤旋，結果較前收續降三十元，甲乙微升四〇元，丁種平平，戊種亦升三十元。</p>
<p>金菜復疲</p>
<p>金針菜出新以來，高低價相比，降度幾及半數，日前雖見稍升，但未久仍趨軟化，良以鎭江方面近有運到，貨質乾美，而開價反廉，較高者僅十六萬五千元，普通不及十六萬元，近日去化依然未暢，一時不易好轉。</p>
<h3>浮空抵補·大戶拉抬　華股又展開漲風</h3>
<p>華股連朝見疲後，昨市由平反動，浮空抵補，一有變化，追風大起，銀根奇濫，買氣步濃，大戶楊某蓄意拉抬，永紗自六三五元，美亞四二〇〇元，景福二三三元，新光二二五元，動興一六三元，逐步上升，近午均呈高價，永紗見六九〇元，美亞四七〇〇元，景福二七〇元，新光二六三元，勤興二〇五元，午收稍盤結果較前收計永紗美亞漲一成左右，景福新光勸興各升一成至二成不等，冷門中小型中型稍穩，小型則回好半成左右，元老股平平。</p>
<p>外股初平後穩，交易仍少，怡紗自八六〇〇元，英聯八八〇〇元，開後均稍盤好，投機氣氛極淡，漲勢不如華股遠甚，其他各小股則漲跌互見，有者收市較早，尚未回升，結果較前收計怡睥微挫，會德豐鋼業平平，業廣紙業航業怡紗英聯各升半成左右。</p>

<p>昨日紐約美棉電訊繼續狂跌一百磅　，計近期陳花三三·三八，遠期新花三〇·一三，米特林現貨三四·〇六，本埠現棉交易較爲減色，市價受美棉連日暴跌影響，惟申新一二五三廠對於細絨原料米特林亦尚有採辦，其他各廠及紡建公司均懐觀望。</p>
<p>棉布市况蕭颯，現貨旣多，實需又弱，一般浮多難以彌補，嗶嘰在跌一千五百元，坯布亦受其牽制，跌五百元至七百五十元，惟漂布及士林布稍平。</p>
<h3>絲綢繼續下挫</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲一二〇號天橋有光，上午做開價一百六十一萬元，成交七八箱，較上日又降落一萬元，其餘雜牌各號貨，均一致下降一二萬元，成交寥寥，廠經交易淸淡，同行殊鮮做開，實銷亦屬毫無，昨只做開七五分高勻度十包，價作二百〇五萬元，十日期票，干經亦乏人過問，綢貨美亞被而與大誡格　縐，塲內未曾做開，喊價較隔日稍疲，華錦　因現貨充塞，且貨頭不齊，價遂做小。</p>

<h3>米市消化不良　油價逐步上漲</h3>
<p>昨南北市到米共計六千餘石，南市活而北市呆，粳米高貨尚俏，中次呆平，秈米去化不振，仍居疲境，白元亦頗疲滯，來貨漸稀，奈消化平常，向榮非易，形勢將成擯局，麵粉連疲之後，店方乘巧納取，消化轉活，略升百元，麩皮供不應求，價格緊俏，小麥汕幫動而不旺，甬方停手，形勢仍高俏次呆，黃豆因汕頭略有問津，油廠亦有動辦，價升四五百元，油市因廣幫暢辦，靑島來貨仍稀，價格步砌，生油再漲二三千元，豆油菜油跟漲二千元。</p>

<h3>英國向美大借款</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者丁維棟十六日寄自南京</p>
<p>美國衆議院於七月十三日在經過激烈辦論之後，以二一九票對一五五票通過「英美財政貿易協定」，內容規定以三，七五〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元的巨款貸與英國，而以英國放棄「帝國和英鎊集團的稅率優光權」作爲交換條件。英美間這個協定，早於五月十日經參院批准、此次衆院通過後，七月十五日就出社會門總統簽字。在今日壁壘分明劍拔弩張的國際局勢下，達　借款的成立，對世界局勢的影響太重大了。</p>
<p>借款談判發生波折</p>
<p>追溯這次借款的歷史，談判的開始是在去年的冬季。在當時，英美行政當局都有明確的認識和充分的誠意，但是民間輿論則殊不一致。在美國方面，認爲英國向來狡滑食言，可能借款到手，而取消關稅。歧視的諾言不能兌現。事實上，這種顧慮到今天還是存在，最明顯的例子就是在這次衆院通過時，有一部份議員主張先准英國提出十億美元，其餘的借款須俟英國表現確能履行諾言時，方准使用。同時，有一部份不開明的美國金融資本家，對於英美借款亦表反對。他們認為英國政府得到這筆巨款之後，勢必在國內大規模推行社會化的計劃；而社會化計劃如能在英國高度的成功，則美國資本主義的社會基礎，將在根本上受到影饗而發生動搖。美國的態度如此，，英國一般輿論對於借款的條件亦深表不滿。英國有不少人士認爲這筆借款最好是作爲一筆禮物贈送，或是至少是沒有利息的貸款，可是現在美國一定要利息，因此英國的與論大爲不滿。有勢力的「倫敦經濟學者」雜誌說：「我們現在的需要，是我們作戰得最早最悠久最激烈的直接結果，……可是我們要付一億四千萬美元每年的利息！」英倫的報紙把美國比作莎氏樂付中的猶太商人。保守黨的人士則認爲英國放棄帝國優先制度，等於放棄了帝國經濟的最後一道防綫，未免讓步太大。因而大加反對。但是，英國必需這筆巨款是個事實，而美國由於政治上經濟上的理由，亦願意談判的成功。幾經折衝，最後於去年十二月六日，雙方代表團在華府成立協定。貸款的總數是四十四億美元，同時取消了英國二十五億美元租借法案的偵務，扣去一部份現款，實際上的貸款額是三·七五〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元；借款爲期五十年，利率2％，自一九五一年十二月三十一日起付。一星期之後，十二月十四日英國國會接受了借款的條件，同時通過了勃里頓森林國際貨幣基金的計劃。身負談判重任的英力代表凱恩斯爵士，事後於英倫廣播、在盛贊美國友誼之中，揷入了一句話：「我是因共同作戰而發生；但是他們對於英國的復蘇，是關心的！」言外之意，不難看出英國對於借款談判，是委曲求成的。</p>
<p>委曲求全難關重重</p>
<p>英國爲什麽要委曲求全，以求談判之成功呢？最基本的理由是：英國在這次大戰中打勝了，但是她本身是打窮了。英國自十八世紀工業化以來，現在是首次由債權國的地位、降落到債務國的地位。截至到去年年底爲止，英國所負的債務共達一五·二〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元。其中一〇·九二〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元是對於帝國內各國所負的債，最大的債主是印度與埃及，前者達四·七〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元，後者亦達一·七〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元。帝國以外的債務亦達四·二八·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元，美國·阿根廷·葡萄牙都是大債主。在艱苦的作戰歲月中，英國犧牲了60％的出口貿易，三分之一的海外資產，四分之一的船隻，作爲維持生存的代價。邱吉爾曾在議會說過：「在這次大戰中，英國犧牲了一切」，的確不是一句空話！</p>
<p>由於這些慘痛的損失，英國是勝利了，但是十分疲倦；而復員和復興的難關重重，尚待克服。首先，美國租借法案的停止，英倫三島的糧食問題即甚嚴重，今後英國須以大宗款項，在海外購衣購食，來養活她的人民。英國出口業的恢復，還須要相當的時間；在華府談判時，英美代表雙方的估計，認爲至少在三年之內英國收支無平衡的希望。何况在英帝國之內，印度埃及都是大債權者，英國即使輸出貨物到兩國，兩國不必瑜出貨物到英國。其次，英國迫切需要美國的借款，作爲復興和改革的資本。在復興工作之中，最重要的是使英國工業現代化。英國工業化得最早，但是由於國民性的持重保守，資本家的故步自封，以致到了今天，工業現代化的程度，反遠遜於美國和德國。在這次戰爭中，美國工業界曾組織訪英團，考察英國工業。他們發現英國工人的工資，至少要比美國低三分之一，這是英國工業的天然優勢；但是英國工業的生產效率遠低於美國，估計平均美國的效率高於英國二倍半以上。英國對於大規模生產上，很明顯的落伍，例如汽車的生產成本，英國就高於美國一倍。因此英國的工業必須現代化，否則就無法改進出口貿易。而要使工業現代化，必須得到美國的友誼協助。因爲所需的資本爲數太大，不是英國單獨能負担的。最後，英國工黨政府要推行社會化的計劃，一方面逐步將煤鐵業收歸國營，而積極使其現代化，同時要推行生活保險，以安定人民的生活；這些興革大計，在在均需巨款。基於以上的三項理由，無怪英國財相在議會中坦白陳說：「英國今後的財政計劃，胥視美國借款是否成功而決定。如果不成功的話，英國只能壓低人民的生活水準，加强貿易統制，渡過這個戰後的難關」。事實上，英國糧食問題相當嚴重，而帝國互惠協定已不足恃。因爲英國在英鎊集團中的地位，已因債務而大形削弱，同時英國在短期內亦不能有大量的出口，換取不需品的進口。因此，向美國借款是唯一可行的上策；另外一個不願意走的下策，便是向蘇聯屈伏。</p>

<p>美國見解籠罩憂慮</p>
<p>至於美國之願意以如此巨款，貸給利害並不完全一致的英國，亦有其經濟和政治上的重大理由。在經濟上，美國工業的生產力，因大戰的刺激而突飛猛晋，而復員工作又異常順利，因此美國的社會經濟已進入空前的繁榮階段，與第一次大戰後的情形相類似。由於過去歷史的敎訓，美國對於不景氣之來臨，時時在預防之中，而最好的預防藥，是多開闢海外的市塲。在這次大戰之前，英帝國是美國最好的顧主，現在美國經濟學家抱有一個共同的見解，即恢復英帝國的購買力，對於美國海外貿易是絕對的必要。所以這次貸款的目的，無疑是恢復美貨在英的市塲。在借款協定之中，英國同意考慮放鬆外匯統制並計劃召開會議取消關稅壁壘，這亦是可以刺激美國海外貿易的發展。同時，借款的附帶月的之一，是鼓勵英國淸償帝國以內的十億債務，並將印度埃及存在英倫的資金解凍，這些國家正在急劇的工業化，必然成爲美貨的好顧主。這是美國願意貸款的經濟理由。至於在政治上，則華府當局的用心至爲深遠，明白的說，就是怕英蘇接近，而陷美國於孤立。這種可能性在現在局面下，看來似乎是種杞憂，但是歷史家吿訴我們，在一九一八以後，英法曾領導歐洲，至少在經濟上對抗過美國。事實上，在一九四五年以前，英國曾用各種的方法，增進英蘇的友誼。英國有力量的人士，公開表示：以蘇聯在戰時破壊之烈，戰後勢必大購機器和鐵路材料等產品，在半個世紀之內，蘇聯將爲英國的良好顧主。同時，蘇聯所產之糧食，木材，毛皮，亦爲英倫三島所需要。一年以來，英蘇雖有許多衝突，但倫敦始終不放棄促進諒解的努力，實在是處處爲了一個不可知的將來留餘地。所以，如果對美借款不能成功，現在主義的英國，是會和現在主義的蘇聯接近，以解決現實的困難。這個局面是美國絕對不願造成的。衆院院長雷朋說：「要是我們不和民主的英國結爲盟友，只怕有人會和英國聯在一起，這時，天知道我們在大西洋彼岸沒有盟友了」！這幾句話，代表了大部份美國人士的見地和憂慮。</p>
<p>借款成功以後影響</p>
<p>英美借款成功後，對於世界大局的影響是很明顯的。即英國今後的對外政策，將更是追隨美國，特別對待蘇聯時，態度將益趨堅定。對於西歐北歐諸國的拉攏，將更形積極。「世界的分裂」，到現在似乎將形成爲一個定局了。在國內，英國將在經濟上作全面的努力，其積極的程度，將不亞於戰時生產的緊張熱烈。只要看美衆院方才通過借款法案，英國就發表定購機器一億美元，就是明證。同時社會化計劃將積極進行，增强英國的經濟力量。產業界的領袖人才，從政的將更爲增加，領導英國渡過這個嚴重的經濟難關。此外，貸款之成功另有一種好影響，就是英國今後對於殖民地的控制，不得不逐漸放鬆，至少在經濟方面如此，以取得美國的友誼和同情。同時，美國資本和商品流入英帝國各地，亦將加速這些地區自治時期之來臨。</p>
<p>對美國而言，借款法案之通過，亦是一大成功。這個朝氣蓬勃的新興巨强，正以軍事和經濟兩項工具，推行其世界政策。軍事的工具是舉世無匹的海空軍，摧毀性的原子彈，棋羅星布的世界基地；這些工具在美國手裏，確對世界有安定的作用。經濟的工具就是國際貸款，協助各國的安定和復與。美國羅斯福故總統，素來主張放棄經濟上的孤立主義，認爲必須世界繁榮，美國的繁榮方能持久；而世界普遍繁榮，持久的和平方有保障。這項政策，華府當局正在積極推行。同時，我們不難看出，美國亦正以借款爲外交上的工具，藉此以爭取各國的友誼，最明顯不過的近例，是蘇聯欲使法國共黨選舉獲勝，接濟了法國一批糧食，白宮馬上答應以十三億美元貸與法國，以表示美國的友誼和關切。貧弱落後如阿比西尼亞，亦取得了一筆貸款；在蘇聯控制下的波蘭，亦在借款之列。惟有亞洲領導國家之中國，至今五億美元的借款，還在若即若離中，而沒有具體結果，這是最使人痛心的。綜言之，在美國目前世界經濟政策之下，任何統一安定的國家，均有復興建設的最好機會；爲我國計，惟有儘速安定內部，完成統一，庶幾不致辜負這個黃金的機會。否則，恐怕國際上對立形勢，日益明顯，有一天美國，將會協助日本的復興，而中國抗戰八年的犧牲，至此將全無代價了！</p>

<h3>邁亞米海濱的七月</h3>
<p>法律所允許的賭塲，原只有跑馬塲。開賽第一日，賭注達到美金一·二四九·八六四元。但賭博的狂然，事實上在各俱樂部，在旅館都一樣浪漫，俱樂部外面佈　　絲網，還有機關槍手把着門口、成千成萬的金錢在裏面滾來滾去。</p>
<p>邁亞米海濱歌無達且的狂潮，不知到什麽時候才會消退，但到銀行看一看存款總數，就不禁使人人都大吃一驚：美金三七六·七五六·一九四·四九元元！這個數目，都是大腹便便的富豪們帶來，預備在這花天酒地的享樂裏化掉的。</p>
<p>統計起來，也實在是嚇人，大邁亞米區的三二，八四九間旅館房間已全吿客滿，二，八八六所公寓裏的約八一，九三一間房間亦全已統統租給了來自各方錢袋滿滿的男女遊客們。停車塲上的汽車，擠得水洩不通。人家家裏你要去暫租一席之地，每星期也要美金三十五元，還得說上一大片感激涕零的話。</p>
<p>比較漂亮的一些大公司，如沿邁亞米海濱林肯街一帶的幾家，常常爲此抱怨：他們的珠寳，皮貨，時裝時常會給顧客統統買光。但有一點聊以自慰：一個月裏已經做了美金三千萬的生意了。（君默，七月十五。）</p>
<h3>港督將作廣州之行　與粵當局商計九龍漢口直接通車</h3>
<p>— 本報廿二日香港航訊　特約記者林友蘭</p>
<p>港督楊慕琦</p>
<p>颱風吹過後，香港叨天之幸，無大損失，旋復常態。港督楊慕琦，爲敦睦中英邦交起見，定於本月廿八日赴省，作官式拜會我軍政當局。楊氏自四月杪抵港，迄今三月，而進省拜會，尚稱首次。</p>
<p>楊氏赴省，前有所聞。傳曾因某些中英邦交不愉快事件（如國民日報事件之類），一度受阻。現楊氏進省有期，粤港兩地關係，或將獲得進一步的諒解。據接近港府之靈通消息方面稱，楊氏與粤當局商討事項，將以九龍漢口直接通車問題爲最重要，廣九鐵路英段局長杜利華在粤漢鐵路七一正式通車的前夕，親率技師多名，深入長沙衡陽各段視察，幷與粤漢路局局長杜鎮遠有所接洽。</p>
<p>九龍與漢口直接通車，對香港商塲，影響甚大，由九龍轉口之歐美貨物將經粤漢路瀉入華中一帶，與上海進口的洋貨，一爭雄長。但九龍進口貨物直入華中，不經廣州轉駁，則香港佔其利，而廣州蒙其害，已爲識者所共覩。粤漢與廣九兩路接軌聯運，遠在戰前已有商討。當日我方特在廣州市郊與築黃埔支綫，打算以黃埔爲粤漢路終站，取九龍地位而代。曾引起港府十分重視。戰後一度盛傳美方助我恢復黃埔開港工程，但不旋躍即轉沉寂。港方最近要求九龍漢口間每月直接通車兩次，但尚未成爲事實。是項問題最後如何解決，現爲港粤中外商界所矚目。</p>
<p>楊氏來港三月，對恢復民政，建樹頗多，其犖犖天者，包括：（一）推行香港自治政制；（二）維持白米配給，公佈對黑市宣戰，決心消滅破壞物價統制分子；（三）平息罷工風潮；（四）定期恢復港貨對英屬地輸出之特惠稅；（五）實行布疋統制；（六）成立建築復興處，修理全港破壊屋宇，開放山頂住宅區，華人住戶不再在禁止之列；（七）整飭市容，大捕小販及私娼等。</p>

<h3>密歇根湖畔仲夏風光</h3>
<p>— 本報五日芝加哥航訊　駐美特派員毛樹清寄</p>
<p>初夏芝加哥的　暑裏，漲在八十八度；密歇根湖岸，成百成千的男男女女，雨　赤條條的，躺在湖邊的沙灘上。從南頭傑克遜公園算起一直到歐文斯頓鎭的北邊，錦長南北廿六英里的芝加哥市，就祇有那麽一條湖岸，是他們的「人間天堂」。碧　的湖水，反映着陽光點點，湖岸的綠楊　柳，臨風灑動。這兒有整齊美麗的公園，有人工佈置的噴泉，有寬暢平坥的馬路，也有夏夜音樂的演奏。夏天是芝加哥的黃金季節，多少美國的富商大賣。他們從紐約·華盛頓·紐奧達斯·邁阿密·經過芝加哥　加拿大避暑。夏天也是芝加哥的瘋狂的季節，多少當地的靑年男女們。他們出生在芝加哥，成長在芝加哥，冬天冷，春天風，秋天雨，祇有一年一度的夏天，湖水帶給他們歡樂，湖岸的凉風，帶給他們甜蜜和愉快！</p>
<p>（一）娛樂中心</p>
<p>全世界最大的旅館在芝加哥，全世界工廠最多的區域是芝加哥，全世界公園最多的都市也是芝加哥。一位市政府的秘書吿訴我，全市著名的大公園，一共有九十六個。一九四六年度，市政府預算公園的管理和行政費，共計有二千七百萬美元，今年度的敎育經費是八千萬元，救火防護經費一千萬元。夏天，從七月四日國慶日起，到九月勞動節爲止，市政府在各大公園開設免費的音樂演奏，每晚由著名的樂歐和歌屋，輪流表演，這些經費，全是由市政府支出的，此外，市政府還預備設置三十多個娛樂中心，分配在全市各高中附近，學校開學的期間，由中學半享受，學校放假的日子，開放給市民享用，「娛樂中心」包括運動·公園等等，據說，這筆經費就大得可觀。</p>
<p>芝加哥是美國第二大市，實際上，芝加哥的市政規模，比紐約還龐大，就面積論，芝加哥南北二十六英里，東西卡一英里，較紐約的『漫海墩』為大，較『大紐約市』略小，就人種的複雜情形而論，芝加哥的波蘭人，意大利人、日本人，都校紐約爲多。在芝加哥，不同國籍的外國移民，常常合羣而居，他們仍然講自己的方言，看小規模的自己的報紙·據說，這一點，是美國當局最感「頭痛」的地方，小部落式的居住制度，會妨碍到對美國的向心力，再說得澈底一點，小部落式的居住制度，不容易爲美國所同化。這次戰爭期中，在芝加哥的日本僑民，一律被移送於西部集中營居住，戰爭結束以後，美國當局，希望把日橋分散到四十八州，不使他們集中一處，但是，不久以後，慢慢的，慢慢的，又都回到芝加哥來了。</p>
<p>（二）複雜的都市</p>
<p>在芝加哥市上我簡直沒有方法區別迎面而來的，是日本人？還是自己的同胞？黃臉黑髮，特別是日本女孩子，長得和中國小姐一樣的淸秀。有一天，我在一家雜貨舖裏買東西，另外一位美國顧客，問我是不是日本人？我吿訴他：我是中國人。店主斥責顧客「無知」與「鹵莽」，顧客不服氣，彼此爭吵起來，最後還是我勸和了事。店主說：芝加哥的日本人，較任何一地爲多，原因是芝加哥人對日本人太『客氣』。但是，店主自己說：『我看不慣日本人。因爲我在菲律濱打過日本人』！</p>
<p>三百五十萬市民當中，黑人佔十分之一，黑人也是　族而居的，他們多半在西區背湖的一端，從五十七街到五十九街一帶，滿街滿地盡是黑人，因此，地方也比較的髒，西區郊外，有很多小村子，也是盡爲黑人所有的，他們都有一幢小洋房，一塊小花園，一輛福特汽車。他們在美國的境遇，也許有悲慘的成份，但是他們的物質生活。却沾了天堂邊緣的光。</p>
<p>芝加哥是一座複雜的都市，從湖濱密歇根愛文義路，到霓虹燈通宵達旦的「國家路」，再向西直走，到麥克思威爾商塲，這其間，你可以穿過好幾個世紀，麥克思威爾，像上海城隍廟，蘇州玄妙觀，南京夫子廟，而且較城隍廟，玄妙觀更髒，更嘈雜萬倍。本來，月亮臭蟲，東西文化各有其優點和弱點，我們看過，也就算了。</p>
<p>社會愈複雜，施政工作是非常困難的。芝加哥有一位被稱爲『鐵腕政治家』的市長開來，芝加哥人稱他們的市政府，有一個特別名詞，爲外間人所不能體會的，那便是『開萊奈希機器』，這架機器，便是芝加哥的統治者，是芝加哥社會一切力量的泉源。奈希比開萊還旱。實在應該稱爲『奈希開萊機器』因爲過去稱慣了，遂相沿成習的沿用下來。芝加哥流傳者一個笑話，說：當上次博覽會開會的時候，各地的工商業出產，都運來芝加哥展覽。有一位鄉下老太太，也進城參觀，參觀完畢以後，辦事人問她感想如何？她儘是搖頭，辦事人問：『老太太有那幾點不滿意？』，她說：「我什麽機器都看見了，爲什麽偏偏少了那架最著名的開萊奈布機器』？</p>
<p>（三）鐵腕市長</p>
<p>你可以想像得到：這一位鐵腕市長的『鐵腕』，將是如何有力？他是民主黨裏的大頭目之一，美國人通常稱他爲民主黨的老闆，民主黨的人只要一聽到『開萊』，最厲害的人，也似乎不能不有三分『賣帳』。據說：當今民主黨的總書記，現任郵政總長漢尼根，是開萊一手提拔出來的人。一九四四年，民主黨全國代表大會在芝加哥開會，華萊士副總統落選，杜魯門出任，這一套過程，也都是開萊從中控制所發生的作用，這段的故事是否確實，我無可考，但是，芝加哥的美國人，是深深相信着他們的市長，有那麽樣大的『魔力』的。</p>
<p>我沒有會着開萊市長，市府的一位秘書，導引着我參觀市立博物館和湖濱天文台，天文台是一個假的模型，裏邊是黑的，電燈一開亮，可以看見天體的行運，行星怎樣轉？衛星怎樣繞？和逼眞的一樣。每天上下午各開映一次，星期天三次，參觀的兒童很多，都是由父母陪同來增長兒童知識的，有位管理員問我：『聽說中國有位瘋子，發明第九大行星』？旁觀的人都笑得合不攏嘴來。</p>
<p>市府的秘書訴我許多芝加哥的瑣　的故事，還說了許多蔣夫人訪美受人歡迎的實况，他　給我那座　在黃金海岸邊的『屈拉格』火旅館，他說，那是當年蔣夫人下榻之所。</p>
<p>（四）黃金海岸</p>
<p>黃金海岸是密歇根湖畔一塊最好的樂園，夏天游泳的人也最多，馬路和沙灘之間，圈有木柵。因爲這一帶，是芝加哥市內建築最講究的區域，都是大銀行大公司的「寫字間」，彷彿像上海南貞路外灘一樣，故以「黃金」名之，也有人說，因爲沙灘上湖光水色的反映像黃金，故名爲黃金海岸，我不懂考古學，也就無暇去深究了。</p>
<p>在芝加哥的十二天當中，因爲副饋事沈作乾兄和王森兄都有自備汽車，曾經好幾次沿密歇根湖岸「兜風」，我們從芝加哥大橋，一直開到歐文斯頓，再向北到伊利諾安和威斯康辛州的交界，這一路，盡是綠蔭森森，星期天，更是前接後踵的汽車，美國人無論男女老少，用「兜風」作消遣，用「兜風」作他們靑春時代的享受，單就密歇根湖岸的汽車行列而論，我以爲比紐約的更多，更普遍。</p>
<p>許多美國人在芝加哥工作，把家眷安頓在歐文斯頓。歐文斯頓是鄰接着芝加哥的一座城鎭，美國著名的西北大學、設在歐文斯頓的湖濱。中國學生在西北大學念書的，僅祗五們人，他們走在鎭上，美國的男女老幼，都認得他們，有位姓趙的警官學校學生，新在西北大學警政訓練班畢業，他曾經參加他們的實際交通管制的實習，爲學校當局所稱道。</p>
<p>（五）大湖平原</p>
<p>我沒有進入威斯康辛州，在伊利諾安州的北部，　訪了許多可愛的小城市，這一帶，是美國的「大湖平原」，像中國的洞庭湖平原和太湖平原一樣，一望無際、盡是　　良田，初夏，農間的紅色割麥機，已經在開始工作，我訪問了好幾戶農家，他們說：他們的麥子收成，一年三回四回不等，他們的耕種，盡是機器，他們是「大農田制」，一個農戶，可以管上相當於中國的一百多畝田，雖然在農村，他們仍然有電燈，電話，自來水，收音機，和衛生設備。</p>
<p>濱湖的田是肥田，他們的湖岸，較密歇根湖的水平面，僅僅高出兩尺，然而、他們從來就沒有水災，芝加哥的一位中國通的美國人說得對：如果芝加哥等於漢口，那末，兩個城市最大的差別，便是一個有水災，一個決不會有水災。我吿訴他，中國正在全國發動，興修YVS，一朝揚子江的水閘修成了，漢口豈不就等於芝加哥一樣？他拍案叫絕！</p>
<p>水利創造了良田萬頃，良田萬頃再加上工業，造成了芝加哥的繁榮和美國的繁榮。這座烟囱最多的世界大都市，在十九世紀中葉以前、還是紅印第安那人的原始原野。一八三三年，美國人打敗了紅印第安人，才越過密歇根湖，來到了芝加哥。</p>
<p>芝加哥的成長，不是偶然的，歷史上，創造芝加哥，有許多偉大的功臣，威廉，奧格敦第一個替芝加哥造了鐵路，麥考密農具公司的開山宗薛勒士，麥考密，奠立了美國中西部的農業工業化基礎。南北戰爭時代，林肯總統的靠山，便是芝加哥，林肯總統的軍政部長說：「如果沒有麥考密的農具公司，把農業制度　質，則林肯總統便不會獲勝」。今天，隨便那一個美國人，東西南北，都認承這幾句話是至理名言。</p>
<p>（六）工商權威</p>
<p>世界最大的兩個屠宰塲，阿穆爾和斯微夫脫，都在芝加哥，阿穆爾就是南北戰爭時代創辦的，南北戰爭時代，美國軍隊已經有吃不完的　頭食品，阿穆爾的屠塲製造的，他無條件供給林肯總統的北軍，打敗了南方的農民軍隊。林肯總統被刺死以後，芝加哥的火車商人波爾曼，特地製了「波爾曼式」的臥車，安放林肯的屍體，裝回春田城，以後「波爾曼」就變成了臥車的專門名字，變成了臥車的專利商人。一直到現在，全美國的臥車，都稱爲「波爾曼」，波爾曼的車廠，也是在芝加哥市內。</p>
<p>芝加哥促成了南北戰爭的勝利，南北戰爭也帶給芝加哥不可撼動的繁榮。南北戰爭時代，芝加哥靠他沿湖運輸的便利，北面吸收了明尼蘇達州的鑛藏，滙合了東面賓夕法尼亞州的煤，奠穩了芝加哥的工業，因此，一直到現在，芝加哥的工廠、還多半設在湖邊。</p>
<p>如今芝加哥的大地主派爾　，在南北戰爭時代，他就收買了「國家路」一帶的地皮，芝加哥的著名商人馬歇飛，（紐約下午報和芝加哥太陽報的主人），他的前代，在南北戰爭時代，就確立了芝加哥的商業權威。芝加哥的「白相人」的幫會和「圈子」，所謂「卡幫尼」領導的芝加哥的正統，也是從南北戰爭時代醞釀起來的。南北戰爭到現在不過八十多年，八十多年間，使這片密歇根湖畔的　腴良田，變成了工業權威的世界都市。</p>

<p>（一）錢奇向貴報社會服務欄指示迷津，爲民衆謀幸福，實深敬佩！鄙人亦有疑問數則：（一）先父生有甲乙丙丁戊五子，乙早喪，丁亦出　他姓，戊係後母所出，在請末時設有雜貨舖，時遭回祿，又兼子女之累，致房屋乏款起造，後由甲獨力翻造，即由甲出租，租金歸甲收受，至民十三年先父去世，甲心素陰險，彼時要求立還囑，乙不願簽字，丁未至法定年齡，由母代押，該遺囑是否有效？法律可有何法補救？（二）該屋權利至七七事變止，乙避難，回後由乙無條件居住，至今該基地是共有的，唯屋由甲起造，所謂「民間借地造屋」並享權利二十餘年，該屋可作共同所有或是歸甲有？（三）戊母尚在，繼承權存在抑或消失？（四）乙無子女，甲現只一子，而戊有二子，將來甲子可能繼承否？</p>
<p>〔曹亞俠律師答〕（一）遺囑如合法，自立遺囑人死亡時發生效力，如不合法，可請求法院確認遺囑無效。但本件請求之時效已失，除非行使權利之期間，因戰事不能遵守者，尚可依法行使權利。否則法律上無何種程序補救。（二）如無其他契約，則應歸田有。（三）時效已失。（四）不能，因現行法並無宗祧繼承。</p>
<p>（二）張夢雲問家舅父於上月去世後，舅母即與其子女間發生遺產科紛，因舅母爲續絃，而未舉行婚禮者，生一女，已廿歲，其子為過房子，問在此種情形下，遺產應如何分配，始為得當？</p>
<p>〔曹亞俠律師答〕如母未與父結婚，不取得配偶身份，子若係「過房」，不從死者之姓，無養子身份，女屬親生，經父撫育者，遺產應由女繼承。</p>
<p>（三）孫我成問民國卅一年余租得本市某處後樓一間，當時並無租約，迄今相安無事，最近三房東（余乃四房客）忽藉口要收歸自用，囑余遷讓，余答以現在房荒如此嚴重，何處去找？有的亦要金條等語回覆後，現據鄰居云：他們擬以不正當手段對付我，故余特來請敎，如有不正當手段，是否可以訴諸法律？法律上是否有繼續租賃權？請貴報公開答覆。</p>
<p>〔曹亞俠律師答〕（一）如遭不正當手段之對付，可訴諸法律；（二）租約未合法終止前，有繼續租住之權。</p>

<h3>哈瓦那！我們永遠地忘懷不了你</h3>
<p>— 秋平九日寄自珍珠港</p>
<p>艦隊到古巴京城哈瓦那是十一日上午。</p>
<p>哈城是中南美洲的尤物，建築宏麗，氣候和暖，好萊塢常來哈城攝製南美風光的彩色電影，華僑居此者約二萬人，有　區，於古巴獨立革命中，比肩城垣，拋頭顱，洒熱血，襄功不小，故古巴歷史家曾撰言讚頌華僑。『無一華人爲叛徒，無一華人爲懦夫』。但却仍如其他各地華僑遭受到同樣歧視和壓迫的命運。祖國雖然已在苦難和砲火中站起來了，但是遠居海外的華僑仍過着數十年來沒有二樣的生活；祖國已列爲四强之一，但是『勝利』在海外還不過是個報章上的名字。</p>
<p>自李公使迪俊出使古巴和古政府訂定友好條約後，古巴的華僑總算鬆了一口氣，然而在工資上，還是受到被壓低的待遇，今天，能眼看見祖國的海軍，揚起靑天白日滿地紅的旗織，從大西洋上長駛進古京的港口，在精神上，才眞正算獲得了解放。</p>
<h3>中國艦隊　羣以先覩為快</h3>
<p>艦隊在熱烈的歡呼中碇泊，人群將碼頭圍得水洩不通。『中國艦隊』，已是數月來報章上慣用的標題和成爲人們談話資料中時髦的名詞了。人們仰了頭在瞭望，以先覩爲快。</p>
<p>海軍們上了岸，坐了街車到華區。一位和藹的筆僑伴着我們，訪問了國民黨，致公堂，中華總商會和領事館，受　謙恭熱烈的歡迎，各處更備了豐富的點心和冷飲招待。『我不是來使您們費鈔的，我是來和您們握手的。』我深深地感激和慚愧，但是我沒有說出來。</p>
<p>在國民小學遇到一位靑年敎員，熱心地吿訴我們一切僑情，並談到海外兒童敎育的萎頓及其嚴重性。哈城華僑子弟一萬左右，却僅有擁學生六十人的初小學校一所。</p>

<h3>艦隊在吳淞口裝載給養</h3>
<h3>驅逐艦雄姿</h3>
<h3>在美受訓之新海軍官員與新海艦</h3>
<h3>指揮艦太康號雄姿</h3>
<h3>敬禮！</h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>經過八年堅苦卓絕的抗戰之後，勝利的中國得到了解放，得到了新生，在這一個新的時代的開始，我們歡欣地看到了我們自己的艦隊，新中國的新海軍。</p>
<p>這艦隊在本月十九日抵達吳淞，包括護航驅逐艦兩艘，永勝，永寳，永寗等掃雷艦六艘，本為美國海軍所有，戰後由美國政府贈予中國。從此以後，太平洋上，將有一番新的氣象。從此以後，海外千千萬萬關懷着祖國的僑胞，將在海外看見掛着中國海軍旗的軍艦了。</p>
<p>我國的海岸綫是這樣的長——沒有海軍根本就談不到國防。千百年來，沿海諸省一向是暴露着的，因之這最富饒的幾省就經常遭受着外來的威脅，國家民族，也因此而不得不委曲求全地蒙受了許許多多次侮辱。在這宿恥盎湔的今日，我們的確是應當早籌補救之計了。</p>
<p>當然，在數量上看來，這艦隊還和實際的需要相差太遠，但無論如何這是一個好的開始。盟邦的友情誠然是可感的，可是主要的還是要靠我們自己，我似應當警惕，我們不應當妄自菲薄。在太平洋上，為甚麼我們不能替代當年日本的地位呢？</p>
<p>我們要自衛。我們需要自衛的武器。我們要使這個好的開端發揚光大，成為太平洋西岸的最强大的安定的力量！</p>

<h3>纖巧與濃郁</h3>
<p>— 墨萸</p>
<p>中國人大都對毛筆有着一個非常微妙的觀上的傳統：那就是如「易象」所幻織成的一樣的以筆觸來體察寫字者的修短和遭際；但是它的作用充其量也就僅止於「體察」而已。如果要進一步明澈地領悟一個人的性格，風度作爲，以及他對人生的處理方式，我覺得毋寗去研究每個人以他的筆觸在生之過程中刻劃下來的東西。</p>
<p>一個人倘是並不因爲出身，環境，和其他客觀上的原因而稍爲改動一下他自己對人生，甚至對事業的基本願望的話，他的作品可能是永恒的保有着異常濃郁的一面。反過來，則他的作品必趨向遊離，飄忽，也就是盡爲纖巧的氣息所掩沒。</p>
<p>天才不一定就能表現出濃郁來，因爲這當中還要有待於作者本身對人生進程的抉擇。趙孟頫的字與畫都是使我們對他的天才不能有所否定的，但是他的一點一劃之間，沒有遺民的哀怨，沒有幽厲的綫條，更沒有豪暢欲流，如泣如訴的筆觸；這是與我們看八大的畫適巧有相反的感覺。他拜闕去國，輾轉流離，這些辛酸與苦難需要有地方去傾瀉，於是畫面上纔構成了意境以外的血蹟和淚痕，這痕蹟全是他個性上的生之執着；他的人生途徑受了窒息，但是還存有一綫希冀，這希冀在藝術上的發揮往往是要超越天才的成就的。鄭孝胥汪兆銘固然在他們的天才上完成了秀逸嶙峋的造形，可是後期的政治生活正徵引了這種造形僅止於纖巧的唯一實證；和趙孟頫一樣，天才泛溢出了他們的人生底層，利慾，倖進，的渣滓塡補了原有的罅隙，結果我們纔永遠看不到他們純摯，穩健，堅實的濃郁的風格。</p>
<p>一個具有纖巧風格的作家，他們對人生往往是恭謹而又想叛逆，拘泥而又想放縱；他們的內心時刻在盤算將如何去控制，運用這至少不會有害於他的現實，因此他們不會有大的顚躓，但也不會有最高的成功，最榮譽也是最合大家理想的成功。曾國藩就是如此：他一生持躬養性，毋枉毋怠，拚命規劃着自己的人生觀，竭力壓抑着環境對自己的偶然的挑撥；不過他仍然是想叛逆和放縱的，我們不必讀他的家書和文集，祗要想到他那兩句「不除庭草留生意，愛養盆魚識化機，」就可明白他原是以追求生意和化機爲其事業以外的崇高目標的，但是結果却爲其纖巧的素養所局限而終至汨沒。這是我們認爲非常値得惋惜的。</p>
<p>失敗在曾國藩手裏的石達開，倒是具有無限濃郁韻味的一個草莽英雄；他那「大盜亦有道，詩書所不屑，黃金若糞土，肝胆確如鐵，策馬渡懸崖，彎弓射明月，人頭作酒杯，飲盡仇難血。」的吐訴完全顯示了他人性的飛揚，熱情的激躍，以及對當世腐化社會的毫無文飾的吶喊；後來他寫下的「寄身虎口遝籌工，恨賊徒不識英雄，漫將鐵鎖綰飛鴻，幾時生羽翼，萬里御長風；……六韜三略總成空，壯懐要問天公，哥哥行不得，淚洒杜鵑紅」。更顯示了革命者對失敗絕不姑息的決心，他從絕望中把自己的理想昇華，不讓它沾染上一點失敗以後那許多頹隳而沒落的氣息；這樣，他雖然失敗，但無妨於他人生的本格；他雖然有英雄末路的悲啼，但這正足以在他的作品上抹上一層可貴的濃郁。</p>
<p>也有人一生中把成敗和織濃形成因果的：幾個正統派的像韓愈等這一流學者，因失敗於仕途而機巧，同時又因織巧而始終不能揚眉吐氣於仕途：這完全由於他們有着過多的矜持和做作。像曹孟德就是以濃郁換取成功，然後因爲成功再淋漓的發揮了他的濃郁性格的；前者使我們想起他那「寧使我負人，毋使人負我」的豪語；後者彷彿使我們永遠記得他在「譬如朝露，去日無多？……慨當以慷，憂思難忘」。裏面所表現出的胸襟；他有抱負，有卓識，不避勞怨，不辭艱辛，終身浸沉在濃郁的氣氛裏而獲致到莫大的生之喜悅。</p>
<p>我一直在期待着如高爾基，果戈里，魯迅等的作品再生，因爲這世界委實什麼都太荒漠與虛僞了；我們現在需要以濃郁的智慧來蕩滌我們的心胸，因爲唯有濃郁，纔能有眞的欣喜，可愛的暴怒，深的哀愁，和崇高的歡樂。唯有濃郁，纔能使我們更淸澈地了解人生，敏感地聽淸楚這時代的呼吸。纖巧是不可能做到這些的，它祗能使我們淪落與糊塗。</p>
<h3>老人（小說）</h3>
<p>— 謝北城</p>
<p>老人一到天熱便脫了光脊樑，揀一個有蔭凉的牆根坐下，手裏撑着一柄芭蕉扇，爲的是搧凉，也爲的是驅逐蒼蠅。</p>
<p>但在這頑鈍的溽暑，他實在太覺疲倦，一陣陣子祗想打盹，年輕時候的那一把子氣力也不知都跑到什麽地方去了。他漸漸的闔上眼睛，忽然一陣蒼蠅在顯上盤旋。一下子挨着頭皮，一下子又飛開去，老人微睜開他疲倦的眼，猛的把蒲扇搧幾下：</p>
<p>他有些淸醒過來，竭力的睜大眼睛，看見攤在前面太陽地下的一攤攤的陳毅子爛芝蔴，忽然想起了他的任務，媳婦是派她來看守這堆東西的，他好像看見媳婦橫眉堅目的立在面前，就假奘沒事人似的，用力的揮着蒲扇，那樣子就好像他從來也沒有打過盹。</p>
<p>不過這一雙眼珠子也眞不做臉，死勁的祇是想往下墜，他用了全身的力氣揪住牠，也揪不住，出了一身大汗，才能讓眼珠往四處矁一矁！</p>
<p>四外沒有人，祗有直化化的大太陽往下照，祗有樹蔭上的蟬拚命的嘶叫：</p>
<p>嘶……</p>
<p>於是他就不再努力，任着那對眼珠子由性的沉下去，讓一重愉快蔭凉的黑暗罩住牠。</p>
<p>牆根下的蔭影迂緩的移動，沒有人管；一股酣適的口涎由老人的嘴巴上淌下來，也沒有管。</p>
<p>於是那一堆陳舊，甚至於即將腐爛的糧食攤在那裏就更沒有人管，偶而有一兩隻冒着夏日的炎熱路過的小島，落下來，慢慢的吃一個飽，然後自顧自的飛開去，更沒有人管，就好像這世界上天生的就是這麼大量，什麼都很閑散冲淡，就像那般外國的中國通，和中國的外國通的那些作家們所頌贊的一樣。</p>
<p>其實這世界可沒有這樣大量，已經許久許久沒有這樣的大量了。自然，從前也許有過的，因爲大家還都憧憬着過去的生活，那時候吃得飽，一袋白麵賣兩塊洋錢，……沒有錢的時候還可以跑到糧食店的門口去喊一聲：</p>
<p>「掌櫃的，賒一口袋麵！」</p>
<p>等一會，糧食店的小夥計便扛着麵來了，古城的老百姓們是過過這樣大量的生活的！</p>
<p>現在不是這樣了，糧食店的掌櫃的看見誰都搖手：</p>
<p>「白麵？你不是做夢！現在連棒子麵都沒得賣了！」</p>
<p>糧食店門口的大菠蘿裏，底朝天，讓太陽晒得格支格支的響，比一個餓乾了的乞丐還難看。</p>
<p>於是人們手裏有了一點錢，便用盡方法去把牠們換一點點可憐的糧食來，不管是白麵也好，高梁米也好，棒子麵也好，豆粉也好，即使是豆餅都好，陳腐了，發了霉的，味變苦了的各種陳糧都好，祇要是有人肯賣，肯討出價錢來，便有人肯買，把牠小心的收藏起來。</p>
<p>白麵兩塊錢一袋的時候，老早過去了，再用力追也追不回來了。</p>
<p>老人這一家自然也不能例外，一家子祖孫三代五張嘴，那隻嘴也得塡飽：</p>
<p>現在這世界，把肚皮塡飽够多麼難呵！古城裏的中國人已經不那麽悠閑，不那麼大方了。</p>
<p>老人的家裏並不富足，但是沒有餓死，兒子在外面賣命，媳婦也出去賣臉，孫子還小，大熱的天也還跑出去，背上毛十來斤的冰，滿街的喊：</p>
<p>「冰核去火，冰核去火……」</p>
<p>任憑汗水怎麽樣淌，那箱子裏的冰塊可是給別人吃的。晚上呢？又揮着汗去跑着喊：</p>
<p>「晚報晚報，看晚報的消息……」</p>
<p>祇有老人一個人，老了，年輕的時候他一個人扛過五袋米，還有一次身上三大麻袋私鹽，由城牆上跳下去，是過一個呌過字號的人物，但是有什麼用呢？他老了，年輕時候的氣力已經又交付給年輕人了，天熱的時候，他祇能靠在有蔭凉的牆跟下讓生命慢慢的耗損。</p>
<p>每逢太陽毒烈的時候，媳婦便想到老人，也是因爲那些糧食太潮濕，太陳腐了。她把這些東西舖在太陽地的草蓆上，希圖晒去一些濕霉的氣味，然後向老人招呼一聲：</p>
<p>「看着點呵，爹！」</p>
<p>便又奔馳出去尋她的生活了。</p>
<p>那一回老人都忍不住嘆息：</p>
<p>「我老了呵，還饒不了我，一點點子陳榖子爛芝蔴……我年輕的時候是吃一頓買一頓的……」</p>
<p>但是他不能不忍住他的固執：</p>
<p>「老了，這是在兒子手裏討口飯的時候了！」</p>
<p>有什麼辦法呢？</p>
<p>於是他祇好忍耐的看守着這折磨他的糧食，粗糲的，而且有苦味的。</p>
<p>可是這世界太寂寞了，沒有人，沒有風，祗有幾隻蟬，嘶啞的嘶呌：</p>
<p>「嘶……」</p>
<p>一切都太單調，太鬱悶，太寂寞，祗是誘惑人圔上眼睛來，讓生命在黑暗的恬靜中逃逝去。</p>
<p>老人闔上了眼睛，便忘記了目前的一切，二十年前的氣力又回復到他的身上來，鬆弛了的肌肉又充實了起來，皺摺了的皮膚被塡滿，眼睛冒着光，小牛似的由黑暗中脫穎出來：</p>
<p>他又重溫習一下二十年前豪邁的生活：</p>
<p>他睜開眼看，還是那濃蔭密佈的農舍外面，鄉村初秋的天氣，纔下過一塲好雨，現在天晴；傍晚的赤霞在天邊抹着，去了秋老虎的燥氣，有一股新凉罩蓋上來。</p>
<p>大家拿着柄蒲扇，可不搧，祇是因爲習慣了，天再凉也想不起來丟掉牠。</p>
<p>老人第一個衝到草牆的外面，大聲的喊：</p>
<p>「好凉快！」</p>
<p>那宏亮的聲音就順着密林的枝株，散浚到背後的田野上去。夥伴們也去擁出來：</p>
<p>「好凉快，這天兒可得來兩盅兒：」</p>
<p>老人暢快的笑了：</p>
<p>「等會兒我呌他們宰兩隻鷄，咱們暍個通快！」</p>
<p>這是一種太熟悉的生活，好像在什麼地方經歷過這麼一段生活，但是現在已經不能尋覓了，他寗神的尋想着，讓淸凉的初秋的風在面上吹拂。</p>
<p>忽然，一陣撲落落的響，一團黑影由樹團子裏衝了出來，嚇了大家一大跳：</p>
<p>一個漢子氣喘喘的撲過來，紅着臉，像抽氣筒般的喘着氣，一下輕一下重的把話語衝出來！</p>
<p>「老，老，老，老大……那面，那面，那……包鹽……讓狗腿……啃，啃，啃，啃……啃住了……」</p>
<p>老人第一個就跳了起來，</p>
<p>「奶奶，奶奶的×……」</p>
<p>衝進草牆去，順手扯起一條白臘扦子往外就走：</p>
<p>「走，打他奶奶的×……」</p>
<p>就像是騰雲駕霧般的，自已也不知道怎麽跑到一個山崗子底下，也不知道怎麼樣的用白臘桿子把別人打退，但是終於每個人的背上扛着三大包體，跨着天步跑回來了。</p>
<p>這一段經過很模糊，但在老人的記憶中是曾每日在追尋的，他曾把這段豪邁的經歷向兒子誇耀過，想不到又輕輕的回說到逝去的榮耀裏去了。</p>
<p>他很高興，奮力的把三包鹽往草堂裏一扔：</p>
<p>「奶奶的，販把子私鹽算隻鳥，老子是靠氣力扛回來的：」</p>
<p>然後拍拍手掌：</p>
<p>「宰他奶奶的十隻鷄，一人一隻，大家夥喝個通快！」</p>
<p>於是在草牆圍着的院子裏就滿院子的：</p>
<p>「咯咯咯……」</p>
<p>鷄撲搧着翅膀滿院子跑！</p>
<p>讓人提在手裏還「咯咯咯」的呌，放在熱湯鍋裏也還「咯咯咯」的呌。</p>
<p>大家都高興，高興的圍着熱湯鍋，看着鷄們撲搧着翅膀在熱湯裏呌，呌呀呌呀的，不好了！</p>
<p>不好了，熱湯鍋，轟的一下子坍了下去，鷄身上都着了火，滿屋子亂跑，滿院子亂搧，四處都是火，熱得很，熱得冒汗。</p>
<p>混亂中，不知道誰在老人的臉上重重的搧一個嘴巴子：</p>
<p>「這老不死的東西！……」</p>
<p>他的身子不穩的一晃，眼前一陣子灼眼的金光，四周圍的熱氣擠上來，頭頂上一片飛禽的影子，撲搧着翅膀飛過去：</p>
<p>「叹叹叹……」</p>
<p>耳邊時見兒媳婦大聲喝斥着</p>
<p>「喝，去—喝，去—」</p>
<p>「這老不死的東西……」</p>
<p>老人模摸自已的胳膊，枯　了，肉，消蝕了，皮皺摺了，他仍回復到那無力的暮年，早年的光榮是一條影子，祗在他的面前一閃，他極力的睜開他的眼，漸漸的他看見，面前攤着的糧子散亂而消薄了，還有三五隻烏鴉不顧命的啄食着。</p>
<p>媳婦紅着臉，淌着汗專神的喝斥，專神的駡：</p>
<p>「喝去——喝，去——」</p>
<p>「這老不死的東西……」</p>
<p>這怒駡在老人的心中像根針刺痛着，他羞赧的底頭，閉起眼來：</p>
<p>「唉，老了！」</p>
<p>蔭影已在他的頭上移去，灼熱的陽光晒着他的頭皮，他都忘了，蒲扇跌落在地上由牠去吧！</p>
<p>媳婦還在那裏揮着手喊：</p>
<p>「暍——去，喝——去…」</p>
<p>忽拉拉的一隻老鴉搧着翅膀由頭側飛過去，翅梢在老人的臉上劃過，火辣辣的被搧了一記。</p>
<p>老人的手下意識的梧住臉，心裏泛起一陣煩燥，暮年精力的消磨他已經失去了忍受年輕人活潑豪邁的耐性了，他霍的睜開眼，跳起來！</p>
<p>「一點子陳榖子，爛芝麻你們！……」</p>
<p>沒有說完，他抬頭看見兒子低着頭站在自己的面前，低聲的說：</p>
<p>「爹，糧食都叫老鴉吃光了！」</p>
<p>老人沒有勇氣把眼光和兒子的接觸，他偷偷的移向那攤糧食的空地上去：</p>
<p>媳婦已經不在趕老鴉了，用一塊齷齪的手絹抹着眼淚，另一隻手握着一柄掃箒，輕輕的掃攏殘餘在地上的糧食。</p>
<p>街外有孩子乾啞着喉嚨喊過去：</p>
<p>「冰核去火，冰核去火……」</p>
<p>太陽仍在直化化的晒着，但是有些偏西了。</p>
<p>老人羞赧的低下頭　　着：</p>
<p>「我老了我老了呵，唉！」</p>
<p>在那失去了光芒的老眼中滴出兩滴淚水來，跌在土地上，滲下去了。</p>
<h3>白鸚鵡</h3>

<h3>豐收</h3>
<p>— 葉飛刻</p>
<h3>繪畫與宗教</h3>
<p>— 俞劍華</p>
<p>宗敎是藝術的策源地，沒有那一種藝術不和宗敎發生密切的關係。宗敎本來是一種虛無飄渺，神秘不可捉摸的東西，爲要使人信仰，就必需要藉助於有形質色相的藝術，用具體的，物質的東西以引起人們對於抽象的精神的想像，因此凡是宗敎，沒有不建造雄壯偉大的神廟的，例如希臘的神殿，基督敎的敎堂，回敎的淸眞寺，佛敎的寺院，道敎的菴觀，以及國家的宗廟社稷，私人的祠堂，在建築中都佔了很重大崇高的地位，歷代帝王的皇宮比起來都有遜色。至於雕刻在先史時代的人民早已用石，骨，木等各種東西，雕刻偶像，以爲崇拜的對象·希臘雕刻妙絕千古，他所雕主要的石像，大部分都是神話裏的神，耶穌敎寺裏的雕像則佈滿了耶穌，聖母，及聖經中的人物。佛敎尤重雕像，在印度的不說，就說在中國，龍鬥的雕像至今還存，而雲岡石窟的雕像，簡直空前絕後。此外舞蹈本起於賽神，音樂本起於敬神，詩歌是在頌神，而戲劇是爲娛神，作爲藝術主流的繪畫，自然也和宗敎結了不解緣。</p>
<p>當繪畫被政治家所利用還沒有解放出來的時候，眞是禍不單行，却又被宗敎家所俘虜了。西洋在中古時代的繪畫幾乎可以說沒有一幅是與耶敎無關的，就是到了文藝復興從需托起到文西，邁開蘭啓羅，拉飛爾那一個不是畫聖母，畫耶穌，畫十字架，畫敎堂的大畫家，那時的晝題除了極少的人像以外，完全離不開新舊約，從文藝復興以後，雖然繪畫漸漸脫離宗敎，從寺院裏逃出來呼吸一點新鮮空氣，向人間世的物象發展，如肖像畫歷史畫風景畫都相繼發展，但是帶有宗敎性的繪畫還並未絕迹。直至近代寫實主義，浪漫主義，印象派，後期印象派等新畫派產生，繪畫才完全脫離了宗敎的束縛，不受宗敎家的支配了。</p>
<p>中國繪畫的情形，也有和西畫近似的地方，自東漢佛敎傳入中國以後，積漸發展，佛敎的勢力竟瀰漫全國，佛敎的信仰竟充滿了上自帝王，下至百姓的各階層。其勢力之大和西洋中古時代的基督相差不多。隨佛敎而俱來的除了經典而外，廟宇的建築，佛像的雕塑，都有了長足的進步。在繪畫方面因爲佛像的輸人，偶像的崇拜，與功德的鼓勵，自三國時代的　不興起就開畫佛　了。此後經過六朝隋唐成了佛畫極盛的時代，所有偉大畫家幾乎沒有不畫佛畫的。如顧愷之，陸探微，張僧　，曹仲達，吳道子，盧稜伽都是此中的佳手，而吳道子尤爲有名。當時佛敎寺院建造很多，在寺院裏的牆壁上都　佛像或地獄變相等與佛經有關的事物。這種壁畫都是請當時的名家担任的。可惜後來許多佛寺都毁掉了，壁畫也隨着損失了，現在唯一存留的只有救煌石室的壁畫了。近年經歐西人的發見，和國人的注意，漸漸流傳於世。友人張大千爲現今的名畫家，曾費二年多的功夫，住在那裏，臨摹了許多壁畫，在壁畫失傳了千年以後，得張氏而重加振興，可以說是千秋絕業，但是究竟佛畫的時代早已過去，僅足供好奇嗜古的一種欣賞機會罷了，佛畫是無法再借屍還魂的了。</p>
<p>佛畫在唐朝山水畫發展以後，就漸漸衰弱，到了宋代，佛敎的地位已完全被山水畫取而代之。有名的佛畫家僅僅剩了李龍眠一兩個人，此後更無專門畫佛的大畫家，在佛敎盛行時代，又有所謂道敎在唐宋兩代，也頗有勢力，幾與佛敎並駕齊驅，所以國畫裘道釋晝成爲專科，現在雖然也還有人畫佛像畫羅漢畫觀音，畫太上老君畫八仙，但已變成人物的附庸，不復能成一派，不見有何大家，而現在所畫的仙佛也漸漸由崇舉的宗敎意味變成觀賞的藝術品了，國畫被政治家利用了幾千年，又被宗敎家利用了一千年，在一方面說，繪畫藉了政治宗敎的勢力，如火如荼的進行了幾千年，不能不說受了政治宗敎的好處，但是在另一方面，因爲「喧賓奪主」，「舍已芸人」，使繪畫不能作正常的發展，甚至被人誤認了繪畫本身固有的價値，也是一種莫大的損失。</p>

<h3>雙宿雙飛（九七）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>麗華被董劭凌始終像撫弄小孩子似的撫弄着，滿肺腑的　　都阻塞在喉嚨裏無從說起！她想吿訴黃劭凌：不是捨不得開對，是捨不得他，是爲離開他而痛苦；爲離開他而悲哀。但，她張了張嘴說不出！許多話像蚯蚓似的在她的喉管裏爬得發癢，終于她禁不住扑在董劭凌的懐裏哭了！</p>
<p>「不哭！不哭！小華，好孩子！不哭！」董劭凌拍着她說。一面拿出自己的手帕替她拭着淚。</p>
<p>董助凌也感動，但却一直不曾意識到麗華深處的感情！他以爲她是畏懼武漢那個陌生的新環境；他誤會她是捨不得開封；捨不得女學校；因爲他知道麗華是一個很好學的孩子，他這樣揣測，因此他的撫慰，便不能觸及麗華的痛處，使麗華止住悲哀。</p>
<p>而麗華這時，也並不怪董助凌爲什麽不能體察自己的心情？她只怪自己爲什麽不能坥坦白白地向董劭凌傾吐眞話？她恨自己太懦弱，但她却無論如何也突不破這條無形的羞怯封鎖綫！由於董劭凌的溫情撫慰，她意識到一種熱流的奔馳，傳佈在她的每根血管裏，她的心像被點起了一把火！</p>
<p>「你也會到武漢來嗎？」麗華終於顫聲地問着。</p>
<p>『也許會來！那時候，我一定還天天去看你的戲！』董劭凌笑着回答，連他自巴也不知道這話是不是靠得住，因爲他就從來沒有預備要到武漢去的意思。</p>
<p>「那麽　來的時候，寫信吿訴劉先生，我會和她一道去接你！」麗華稍稍欣慰地說。</p>
<p>『好的。到了那兒，空的時候，多跟劉先生在一起念書，寫字；不許常常悲觀，流淚；要快活，要笑！聽見沒有？要笑！』董劭凌股殷地叮嚀着。</p>
<p>『聽見了！』麗華點了點頭，果然仰起臉來向他微微笑了一下。</p>

<h3>獻給醫生們</h3>
<p>— 吳雙人</p>
<p>申報「自由談」，本月九日有「我怕醫生」一文，十三日又有某君的「我愛醫生」一文。兩位作者的命意，完全相反。讀者對於這個年頭的醫生，久已想貢獻幾句話，趁此機會，也來湊湊熱鬧。</p>
<p>我愛醫生是天經地義的原則，也是人們的常情。我怕醫生是憤激之談，有為而發。因為一個人免不了疾病，醫生是治療疾病，使被診治者回復健康的。所以病人心目中，把醫生看做救苦救難的天使，應該要「愛」——「怕」是反常。</p>
<p>筆者未見「我怕醫生」原文，僅從「我愛醫生」文中，知道現有這麼一篇。所以原文讀些什麽？可不知道。不過就筆者近數年末對於一部份醫生的觀感，積　了許多意見；正如骨鯁在喉，非吐不快。今敬告如後：</p>
<p>生老病死，蓋人所不免。如果病入膏肓，奄奄待斃，死神早晚降臨，那倒死心塌地，不作希翼之想了。最為重要的是不死的病。生枯起朽，祛除病魔，是醫生的天職。疾病的能否速痊？基於三個條件：一是診斷準確，對症下藥；二是時間問題，着手醫治，愈早愈妙；三是醫生的醫術和醫德問題。筆者誠知熱忱的醫生，抱割股之心，而且醫道高明，手到病除的固然不少。然儘有惟利是圖，不祗是敷衍兵家，甚至故意拖延日子；也有粗心浮氣，隨便診察，用藥不當，以致急病久待，終成不治的；更有自知學術所限，無力療治，而　圖診金，不肯讓賢的。凡此種種，都是違背三條的一部或全部，犧牲了病人。希望現代藝術，趕緊改善！筆者回憶敵偽時期，各地被空襲受傷的人民，流血不止，好不容易，貨車子送到醫院，到處不肯接受；有的醫院雖然接受了，但並不立施急救。因時間的延誤，送入枉死城者，不知凡幾。最近各地虎疫流行，醫院爲了收容已滿，又發生上述現象。我想做醫生的，本乎人道主義，總該於無法之中，多多設法吧。</p>
<p>末了，還有附帶警告幾句話：年來醫資藥價，日益增漲；以致普通病家，無力請醫服藥，因此誤死的，達到很高的數字。還有醫例太嚴，深夜不出診；星期日不出診；非在規定時間，不問病家貧富，診金要「拔早」和「加晚」的特別費。依筆者的意見：人生以服務為第一，以上以此為職業，固然不能不顧到家庭開支，以增裕收入為目的。但希望什麽事都帶一些彈性！尤其是金錢和時間的酌量通融，造福病人非淺。那麼怕醫生的一定全變為愛醫生的了。</p>
<h3>第三者的意見</h3>
<p>— 佑芙</p>
<p>全上海的人民都在可望着對交通方面有一種好的辦法改善，好讓道三百七十萬市民在「行」的方面有所滿足。</p>
<p>我曾將這問題請敎於第三者我的美國先生。</p>
<p>當我告訴她目前上海交通情形的時候，她很開誠地根據她居住上海十年的經騐，提出幾點意見：並希望能轉運負責指揮與管理交通的當局。</p>
<p>她說！「爲什麽上海交通秩序不好，常常碾死人？有以下的原因：</p>
<p>一、各種車輛不按照規定速度行駛。</p>
<p>二、馬路上空的三輪車與人力車太多。</p>
<p>三、車輛停止十字路口，再行前進時，不按先後的次序開行。在美國，絕無此種情形，車子先後次序，一點不亂。</p>
<p>四、不坐車的行人多半不在行人道上往來，而在馬路上走。行人道等於虛設。</p>
<p>五、馬路上做生意的太多，如書報攤流動香烟攤皮鞋油，旅行袋，梳子等零售小攤。諸如此類影響行人道的交通。</p>
<p>六、南京路自八點至十二點，旣不准三輪車與人力車通過。那麼汽車一樣的在其他小馬上也該於上述時間內禁止通行。</p>
<p>如果將以上的六種問題，加以切實的改良，相信上海的交通秩序至少比現在好得多。</p>
<p>我很感激這位第三者的意見。雖然這意見很平凡，但交通本來就是一件平凡的事情，只怕你連平凡的意見都不能接受，最低限度的人人知道的辦法，都不能實行，那就只好永遠糟下去了！</p>
<h3>漢奸託庇洋勢力澳門闊佬未落網</h3>
<p>— 方君</p>
<p>闊佬到底與普通人不同，自從廣東行營公佈了第二批漢奸名單，高可寗便受到當地政府——澳門——的保護了。據前些日子此間的報載：他不特出入有武裝備警相隨，而旦住宅還要佈置防綫六道，儼然成了一座堡壘。這眞威風十足，連任何一國元首都不如，「鹹蝦」當局這麼的保護嚴密，在高可寗個人方面固然是受寵若驚，抑且是感激涕零，而在「鹹蝦」一方面看來，也認為妥貼週詳，自是躊躇滿志，不虛有他了。</p>
<p>高可寗原是那地方底三山三岳的人馬，在香港也有名頭，一向有「高伯」之稱，更在那地方養活一班　　，不在少數；尤其對「鹹蝦」當局的貢獻甚大，每月例有捐輸，也每年例有繳納，都是一個可觀而且是驚人的數字；而他的功勞又是替那地方增進不少繁榮，更是那地方一位活生生的「財神菩薩」，也許如密宗裏三十六觀音畫像之一（密宗裏的觀音畫像有一位男性）的是「鹹蝦」底救苦救難的觀世音，因為在他的事業上頭，他就是「鹹蝦」一條最大的輸血管，其實是「鹹蝦」的最大生命腺，生命腺誰也予以珍視的「鹹蝦」當他降此殊恩，特予嚴密保護，從這一方面說來，「鹹蝦」還是為了要珍視自己最大的生命腺吧！廣東行營（第二批名單其實是漢奸委員會公佈的，）之突然轟了這一下「旱雷」，寗不把「鹹蝦」嚇喪了胆！然則他對高可寗如此的關垂，又豈是無因而致！</p>
<p>「鹹蝦」對高可寗之保護有加，其實際情形大槪如此；或者另有充份理由，則殊不能予以測度；不過，廣東方面「旱雷」是打下來了，有無沛然的雨，却要等將來專實的證明。但，「鹹蝦」的生命腺有關，他那住宅週遭的六道防綫，恐怕就爲了這一個意義而設吧！</p>
<p>高可寗之有今日是他以前所夢想不到的，一個在渡船裏唱龍舟歌的丐者。唱龍舟歌的丐者是在手上拿着一具龍舟的。龍舟是木頭製成，長二尺左右，闊不過半尺，雕成一個張口的龍頭，髹得五顏六色，並附金箔，看去文彩煥然，亦殊有致。龍口之前的木片上，穿有洞孔，備人捕香，龍頭之下具舟形，兩旁有好幾個木偶持櫓作勢，下面圖上紅布一匝，中置把手，長幾四尺，可以手持，可以肩負，這就是所謂龍舟。丐者胸懸一面小羅，下壓小鼓，左手持小木杵一根，唱時鑼鼓聲然，甚有節奏，即唱詞亦有一定，總不外是些吉利的詞句。高可寗便那末的在渡船裏過去了一個悠長的歲月，怎又料到賭運亨通，居然做了澳門的「闊佬」。——「鹹蝦」的生命腺。在今日的情勢上看，「鹹蝦」是少不了他。但，他呢，又似乎少不了「鹹蝦」了。</p>
<p>「狽無狼不行，狼無狽不走」高可寗現在該呼李宓的警句：「臣之進退，實為狼狽」了。然後，「鹹蝦」也得說：「臣無祖母，無以至今日，祖母無臣，無以終餘年」。</p>
<p>然而，高可寗也算得威風了，在袞袞諸公中，幾曾見有受到「鹹蝦」如此的優待！但得當心，在傳說上的呂蒙正做了大官之後，也不免手指傷寒，一暝不視。到底窮乞相是受不得優待的，別忘了「　」（睡的解釋）蓆「宙」（蓋的解釋）蓆之時，在層層密護之中，伸出一截手指去，以致手指傷寒，害上不治之病。</p>

<h3>舉辦米糧貨款兩度麻煩會計師</h3>
<p>— 武陵人</p>
<p>傳周佛海工　邨籌諸逆押解　慶近郊監禁後，近忽發現常在華貴之舞場中，　酒婦人盡情享受，我敢確定這消息決不可算，否則忠字監中一批人早應聯名提出責問了。</p>
<p>不平等條約取消後上海地方法院審過兩件外人被訴案件，一為白水手上海黑水手案，結果被告宛達所受處分並不甚重，而法院却支付了一筆證人生活費用。一為華商中元輪船公司控告英商洋行案，結果中元敗訴，且須負擔一千八百餘萬元的　費。這兩件暗自很可以使外人欽佩吾法院的態度公正，依法辦理，一秉至公。</p>
<p>米糧賞　初辦時要麻煩會計師審核，發生了舞弊案，又要請會計師查帳，救災義舞，亦須會計師出席，會計師在今日可謂「吃香」之至；預料接受工作清查團的工作過程中，也少不了麻煩他們一番。</p>
<p>國貨公司櫥窗中，亦有玻璃雨衣出售，可喜。</p>
<p>十七歲的黑人威利弗　西斯，因殺人罪被處死刑，坐上電椅後，恰巧因電門損壞，得以未死。當局以如再度處以死刑，未免太殘忍，因此或將改處無期徒刑。但亦有人研究，據說終身監禁之苦痛，更甚於死刑。如此說來，則</p>
<p>「置人於死」，有時亦可說是合乎人道，是一種含有「體卹」的意義？</p>

<p>— 周瘦鵑</p>
<p>所奇怪的，你去了這麼兩個多月，到底是忙着甚麼？為什麽不來入夢？難道你已做了個忘情的太上，把我這廿九年的老伴壓根兒忘了麼？難道你迷失了路，已認不得這故園的門巷了麼？難道你兩眼模糊瞧不見王長河頭鬱鬱葱葱的萬綠叢中，蔽着這一座我正歌哭於斯的木棚子了麼？難道你已忘了平日寵愛的幼子　兒，他正考完了暑期的大考，閒在家裏養鴿子，你也不想來瞧瞧他淘氣不淘氣麼？你不見那高高的楊樹稍頭正爛爛漫漫的開着凌青花；你不見那梅邱岩石上的忍冬，正第二次開着審嘖嘖的白花；你不見那梅屋下的荷池中新荷出水，正臨風搖動着一柄柄的翠蓋；著都是你生前所愛好的，你為什麽不來欣賞一下啊？唉！鳳呀鳳！你旣不來入夢，我又不知道到哪裏去找你，只索時時向着你的遺像訴說一切，也不知道你聽得不聽得？有時我要甚麼東西，不覺脫口喚着你的名字，以為你仍在我的左右；有時我在外聽得了甚麼好玩的新聞，興興頭頭的趕回來想告知你，踏進了門口，纔恍然而悟，知道你已不在人世了。唉！鳳呀鳳！你的軀殼雖死了，你那偉大的精神，將永永活在我的心坎裏，永永不死！</p>
<p>我把你安葬好了之後，就聽從了珍侯譜兄的勸告，到上海去蹓躂了一下，就住在他那裏；他們夫婦倆爲了要安慰我，起居飲食，都給與我非分的享受，五月初八那天是我的小生日，他們特地做了麺，備了好多的菜，邀集我們的子女都來團聚；關愛之深，有過於同胞手足，眞使我感激涕零，不知所報，料知你在天之靈，也一定深深的感謝咧。我曾兩度到你的母家去，探望你的母親和嬸母，一見了她們兩位老人家，淚珠兒就禁不住奪眶而出，一面斷斷續續地述說你一病不起的經過，一面却老是抽抽噎噎的語不成聲，連她們倆也陪了不少眼淚。還有一件我家的大事要報告你的，就是我們的媳婦玉帶，端午那早上七點半鐘，已在廣慈醫院中產下了一個女兒，體童九磅，玉雪可愛，我給她提了一個名字呌做「明　」，把她父親小時節所佩的那個金鎖片給她佩帶了。可憐你已瞧不到了這可愛的小孫女兒，你要是見了她，一定　歡喜無量的。</p>
<p>我在上海住了兩星期，有好幾位老友那裏都沒有去，去了就得提起你，一提起你就要刺痛我的心；這一片苦衷，料他們定會原諒我的。鄭子褒姻兄邀我去吃飯，說了好些很有力量的安慰我的話，他是個最樂觀的人，不知憂患為何物；他勸我要趕快忘掉這一段傷心史，譬如看書，一頁一頁的翻過去了，不必再翻；我們果然希望夫婦倆能白頭偕老，但是死的死了，不能跟着一塊死兒，那就不妨另覓對象，從新做起。珍侯譜兄和我那個三十年不能忘情的伊人，也都誠懇的勸告我，說你在生前一向是愛滬我的，死後一定還是關心於我；為了你的分上，為了子女們的分上，萬萬不可灰心，總得保重身體，振作精神，重做起一個新的家庭來。我接受了他們的勸告，身心上平添了一股活力，決計好好地從新做起，以告慰你於低下。</p>
<h3>恐怖、毀滅、退化。想像中的第三次大戰——姑妄言之，姑妄聽之。</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>這是第三次世界大戰的故事，原子武器已發展到機高度，天才的科學家很熟練地運用這些恐怖武器，生命與物質的恐怖極端，已被列强任意操縱。戰爭開始的最初兩天，全世界所有大城市及其居民，都熔成灰燼。</p>
<p>建築地下城市</p>
<p>預料到戰爭有如此恐怖，這些國家已秘密地築造了好多幾千呎深的地下城市，因為這種城市，不怕原子武器的轟炸，而軍事領袖一經開展，就領導人民移往遠處地球一角的地下城市，以保安全。然而人類的毅力，可使一次戰爭結束了全面的戰爭。使人想像不到的，還有比原子彈及火箭更猛烈的武器，可以投擲到決門之場。一種無綫電光波，使所有在直徑一百哩內的金屬熔成液漿。最初人們想不到它的結果有如此恐怖。直到一架飛艇，用看不見的電光，射到敵軍陣地之上，所有的大炮，坦克車，飛機，原子武器，戰艦，鐵路以及所有金屬物體都被光波刺入而熔成液漿。電話，無綫電，電鐘，電器，瓦斯，自來水設備，在一夜之間，全部毀滅。電綫與鐵管都被無綫電光波所熔得軟曲。</p>
<p>金屬完全熔化</p>
<p>摩天樑和橋樓成為粉碎，普通的房屋，當鋼骨與鐵釘熔成液漿時，完全瓦解。甚至使對方再沒有一柄鐵刀可以繼續作戰。除了無條件投降外，別的沒有走處。後來這秘密被第三國的間諜所偵悉，馬上對第一個國家作次偷襲，戰爭爆發後，恐怖情形，連續多天，比之一夜的獲　，更見可怕。甚至攜帶此種新武器的飛機，也和世界上所有武器，遭受同樣命運。當地底下面的城市用鋼管水泥築成，洞穴櫛比，住有幾百萬居民，都被轟炸，而祗有對比一機器時代表示驚奇。</p>
<p>回復石器時代</p>
<p>於是人類由於他們的智力，重新由原子時代，經過電氣時代，銅器時代及鐵器時代，與所有進化之路，回歸到石器時代。幾千年來所有從努力中生產的一切，都被毀滅。從此以後，人類所能製造的工具，祗是石刀木棒而已，非常粗糲。但好戰的國家，還是作戰，石器時代人類所用的兵器，並非石刀石槍，而為一種强有力兵器——微菌。他們在餘燼之中，自由番殖經過相當時期滿地皆是，而人們却不知他們的為害。所以他們可儘量地侵害人類而那些製造戰爭的主宰，忙於同類相殘，忽略了這種看不見的大敵，微菌已深入了世界上所有的人羣。地面上多數房屋。用泥塗草蓋，祗有少數幸存的，也已門窗不全，牆壁傾倒了。</p>
<p>災難降臨世界</p>
<p>然而時間是太遲了，若干可怕地事件又將來臨。天然的巨災，由於人類的疏忽，突然蒞至，使金屬熔化的電光，更影響到深埋在地下的礦苗漸漸地，但很可怕地石層，開始移動，由自己調整，社麼地方都有地震，山嶺移動，互大的陸地埋沒了無數人類。動物得到幸運，可攫殺任何生物。新的火山出現於整個地球，熔化的礦物堆使地球表面脆薄到極度。迸裂的火山，射出一種有無綫電作用的熔化金屬，一到夜間，流光兩處，使人驚懼。凡是和這種毒氣觸及的動植物，完全毒死。下沉的火山，發出巨量的蒸氣，使地面的空氣，不適於人類呼吸。</p>
<p>人類全部毀滅</p>
<p>由於陷落的山嶺，蒸熱的湖水及海水，不平的道路，燃燒的火花，人類的呼號，到處盡是，使地球慢慢地變成地獄樣喧擾。幾個月後，地　震作響而沉到底處，終於靜寂之後，地球重新安靜，祗有人類被毀滅盡了。當那月亮再抬頭而照到熟見的地球時，祗見僅有巨大的石壁，耀目的湖光及一片寂寞，藍在地球的表面。</p>

<h3>Marshall Again Ascends Mount Lu to Meet Chairman and Discuss the Current Situation; Also Holds Talks with Song Meiling Before Departing Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Guling, 26th] Special Envoy Marshall took off from Nanjing at 2 PM this afternoon, arriving in Xunyang at 3:30 PM. At 6:45 PM, he arrived at the Guling Guesthouse by sedan chair. Chief Secretary Huang Renlin specially represented the Chairman in descending the mountain to welcome him. Madame Marshall also went by sedan chair to Xiaotianchi, waiting for several minutes. When Marshall's sedan arrived, Madame Marshall waved her hand to welcome him no less than three times. Marshall also waved in return. Upon meeting, they shook hands warmly. Madame Marshall suggested getting out of the sedan and walking, talking as they walked. Madame Marshall immediately told Marshall that it had been raining continuously since he left. She also said, "I specially prepared two lamps for you in the study, so that you can read books and newspapers more easily." Madame Marshall also related to him that Madame Chiang Kai-shek treated her with sincerity, often inviting her to the guesthouse for meals and walks, and often accompanying her to Marshall's residence for meals, etc., one by one. Marshall also described the journey to Madame Marshall, appearing extremely pleased. They walked to the entrance of Guling Street, and then took the sedan back to the guesthouse to rest.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Guling, 26th] Marshall spoke with Chairman Chiang for 35 minutes at the Chairman's headquarters at 7:25 PM tonight, conveying the opinions of the Communist Party and agreeing to continue the meeting at 9 AM on the 27th.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 26th] The prelude to political negotiations has restarted today amidst the nationwide flames of war. The crucial theme is naturally how to extinguish the flames of war. However, judging from the content of Zhou Enlai's discussions with Marshall and Ambassador Stuart throughout the day until midnight, it still shows his full obstinacy and his desire to infiltrate unnecessary so-called new issues "such as the assassination case of Li and Wen" to obstruct the resolution of the problem. Marshall's return to Nanjing and Ambassador Stuart's delayed trip to Beiping are all for the sake of our country's peace. Ambassador Stuart once firmly believed that with his firm religious spirit, he could seek a proper resolution to this problem. Marshall is also willing to sacrifice his family life and, at the advanced age of over fifty, do his best to mediate between the two sides. However, Marshall still had to return empty-handed today, and Ambassador Stuart remained in the capital with confused emotions. This is what is causing anxiety among the national people who are expecting peace. According to reports, Zhou Enlai visited Marshall at 10:20 AM this morning, talking for two hours, and then visited Ambassador Stuart at 7:30 PM, and had dinner together, then held talks until 10:30 PM. It is understood that in addition to the war issues, some new branches have been infiltrated into the content of the two talks, namely the assassination case of Li and Wen, etc., using some past events as citations, so that the review of the main problems cannot be carried out.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Guling, 26th] It is heard that Marshall's second visit to Mount Lu will involve decisive discussions with Chairman Chiang on the current situation. Whether the overall situation can be clarified still depends on whether the Communist Party has sincerity in the peace negotiations.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Taizhou, 26th] The National Army is pressing on Qutang and will be able to take it down soon.

Military officials here expect it to be taken down within three days.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Zhenjiang, 26th] The Communist army in Gaoyou has been frequently mobilizing in recent days. Some have been transferred north from Shaobo, and some have been transported south from Gaoyou. However, most of them are dragged along the waterways east and west along the canal at night. However, the Communist army transported southward to Yangtai County is actually more than transported northward, and there is still exaggerated propaganda of attacking Yangxian. At the moment, the Youshao line has been closed for traffic.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Zhenjiang, 26th] Because the Communist army in northern Jiangsu has been retreating steadily in recent weeks, some small groups have been sent to flee to southern Jiangsu, attempting to disrupt the Nanjing-Shanghai line. The 57th Brigade of the National Army stationed in Zhenjiang, in order to maintain local order, specially convened a security meeting on the 26th to encourage the people to implement the defense of their hometowns and prevent the activities of unscrupulous elements.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Zhenjiang, 26th] According to a phone call from Yangzhou, six regiments of the Communist army disturbed the Dayi settlement, Ganquan Mountain, and Yangjia Temple area on the 26th, and rushed to build large-scale fortifications around Yangjia Temple, with ambitions to invade Yangzhou, in order to save the declining trend of the Yangtai Highway and contain the National Army.</p>

<h3>Communist Party's Distorted Propaganda Does No Harm to the National Army</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Rugao, 26th] The National Army stationed in Nantong, after ten days of hard fighting, finally defeated the invading Communist army and entered Rugao City at 5 PM on the 23rd. However, after the Communist army suffered heavy losses and retreated, it used its consistent propaganda techniques to spread rumors that the National Army's 49th Division suffered a defeat and that Division Commander Wang Tiehan was captured, in an attempt to confuse the public. Now, the facts prove that the ones who defeated the Communist army and recovered Rugao City were the National Army's 49th Division, which the Communist Party widely publicized as having been annihilated. And Division Commander Wang Tiehan was not only not captured, but led his troops directly to Rugao, the Communist army's base area. From this, it can be proved that the Communist Party's distorted propaganda does no harm to the National Army, and is enough to expose that its propaganda is baseless, does not pay attention to reality, and deceives the people. This reporter arrived in Rugao this morning and met with Division Commander Wang Tiehan, and asked him for his impressions of the rumors spread by the Communist Party published in the Shanghai newspaper. Division Commander Wang laughed it off and said that all officers and soldiers of this division (referring to the 49th Division) are dedicated to the revolution, but only know how to protect the country and defend the people, are loyal and self-respecting, and will not hesitate to do what is right. The Communist Party's propaganda techniques are enough to prove its shamelessness.</p>
<h3>Communist Army in Hebei Builds Two Major Defense Lines; Deploys Heavy Troops Along the Zhang River; Communist Army Attacking Lutai on the Beining Railway Fails</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 26th] Baoding Phone: (1) The Communist Army's Taihang Military Region has built two major defense lines along the Zhang River, one being the northern bank of the Wei River, a strip of land more than a hundred miles long, and the other being the area from Cixian to Matou Town. The former defense line is stationed with more than 50,000 troops, and the latter defense line with more than 30,000 troops. The purpose is to prevent the National Army from going north. Liu Bocheng serves as the commander-in-chief, and he has arrived in Cixian from Nanyang. (2) Hebei Chairman Sun Lianzhong returned to Beiping from Baoding this afternoon. Hebei provincial government personnel will receive military training in turn. Chairman Sun strictly prohibits Hebei provincial government officials from official or private socializing and does not make official pick-ups.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 26th] The Communist army's glimpse into the Beining Railway is getting tighter. Lutai, between He and Tang, was attacked by approximately 700 Communist soldiers this morning, and fought fiercely with the garrison for two hours before retreating. Traffic is smooth.</p>

<h3>Those Who Divide China and Oppose the Central Government Should Be Condemned by the World; The New York Times Defends US Policy Toward China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from New York, 24th] The New York Times published an article today refuting the rumors that reactionary factions in the United States and China are trying to provoke China into war, and defending the United States' recent policy toward China. The editorial is titled "Our Mission in China", and the article says: Chairman Chiang's National Government is the only recognized government of China, and as a wartime ally, it has obtained the guarantee of US assistance, and according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, it has obtained the special guarantee of the Soviet government's separate moral and military assistance. Therefore, any protest should not be directed at the government and its supporters, but should condemn those who oppose the government and divide China. The Soviet Union's accusations against the United States in the economic field only need to compare the Soviet Union's control and interception policies towards other countries with the United States' open-door policy of free trade and equal opportunities to ensure peace, and its accusations can be seen as ridiculous. In the richest northeast of China, those who seek a state of monopoly and privilege are the Soviet Union, not the United States.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Washington, 25th, United Press] Thirty-eight members of the American Policy Association recently requested the State Department to stop the policy of urging the Chinese government to continue to make concessions to the Chinese Communist Party. They accused the Chinese Communist Party of breaking its promises to China and the world, and constantly striving to turn China into a vassal of the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Communist Party Plots to Sabotage the Railway Between Changzhou and Benniu on the Shanghai-Nanjing Line; Patrol Military Vehicles Are Dispatched to Prevent It</h3>
<p>[Report from Our City] According to news from the transportation sector, at around 10 AM yesterday morning, near Changzhou Station on the Shanghai-Nanjing Line, a large number of Communist soldiers, about 300 in number, were found wearing variegated clothes and carrying rifles, pistols, and submachine guns and grenades, banding together to sabotage Changzhou Station. At the same time, about 100 Communist soldiers were also found at Benniu Station, 9 kilometers away from Changzhou Station. After being discovered by the local road protection team, it immediately notified road protection units everywhere to immediately increase their defenses. The Communist soldiers, seeing the situation, could not succeed and immediately dispersed and fled. It is confirmed that a grenade was found on the platform of Hepingmen Station, 5 kilometers away from the capital Nanjing, at midnight on the 25th. After being discovered by the station's road protection police, it was reported to the station's police section and immediately removed. Where this grenade came from and who placed it are currently unknown. The Shanghai line failed because the road protection team had strict defenses, so they used small attempts to destroy the station's equipment, thereby threatening the safety of passengers and disrupting public order.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that Tang Enbo, Commander-in-Chief of the Shanghai-Nanjing Garrison, recently ordered Guo Fuzhou, Commander of the Road Protection, to strengthen defenses to prevent unexpected events. After receiving the order, Guo discussed it with the Railway Bureau.

<h3>Communist Army's Vicious Plan Again Breaches the Honghu Dike</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 26th] According to news, the Communist army in northern Jiangsu recently planned a brutal and inhumane plan. If the war in northern Jiangsu is completely lost, it will destroy the dikes of Gaojiayan on the banks of Hongze Lake and Doubanji, Liulaojian, and other places along the canal to flood more than 20 counties east of northern Jiangsu and all counties in Huai. It is heard that the Communist army has now forcibly conscripted laborers in various places to prepare for excavation at any time. According to a common saying in northern Jiangsu: "If Gaojiayan collapses, Huaiyang will not see each other", which shows the magnitude of the water and the intensity of the harm.</p>

<h3>Li Minran Meets with Du Yuming; Agreement Can Be Expected if Talks Go Smoothly; Li Says He Will Make the "Peace Line" a Success</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Shenyang, 26th] Lin Biao's representative Li Minran's arrival in Shenyang has attracted much attention. On the morning of the 26th, Cai, the leader of the military mediation team, accompanied him to visit Chief Du, and they talked for three hours, leaving at 12:15 PM. It is heard that Du explained his opinions on the situation in the Northeast according to the government's intentions, and Li also put forward Lin's opinions. It is heard that the distance between what the two sides put forward is quite far, so it is difficult to reach what the general public expects for a while. According to Li's words to reporters: Du's frankness is admirable, and understanding each other's opinions should help in the negotiation of the issue. When asked if he would visit Du again, Li said it was possible. As for asking how Lin Biao's opinion is? Li said that it has not yet reached the time to publish it. Well-informed people believe that Li's visit here is to deal with the field for Lin, because Lin did not go to Changchun for the appointment, so this move is because the Northeast issue still needs to be considered in Nanjing as a whole.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 26th] Powerful authorities here believe that Li Lisan's visit to Changchun and Shenyang is not worthy of attention, because the major plans of peace and war are decided in Nanjing and Lushan, not in Changchun and Shenyang. A certain important official also pointed out that Li Lisan's visit to Changchun and Shenyang is aimed at "wanting to run the Xinhua Daily in Changchun and Shenyang", but in general, the current situation in the Northeast is indeed easing, because the Communist army suffered huge losses to the main force after the Battle of Siping Street, and it urgently needs a considerable amount of time to replenish and reorganize before it can talk about war. On the National Army's side, after the victory, it must also consolidate the recovered areas and supplies. Therefore, although the flames of war are raging between the Yangtze and Han Rivers, the Northeast can still present a situation of rough peace in the short term.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Beiping, 26th] According to various sources, Lin Biao's representative Li Lisan's trip to Shenyang is not, as he said when he first arrived in Changchun, purely for a reply visit. If the talks with Du Yuming go smoothly, it is possible to seek an agreement on all or part of the following issues, namely (1) extending the local peace in the Northeast, (2) evacuating the Japanese prisoners of war in the Communist area before the end of September, (3) re-negotiating the demarcation of a buffer zone along the north bank of the Songhua River, and (4) the Communist army refraining from destroying the Xiaofengman power transmission to Shenyang. Li left Changchun for Shenyang, saying before his departure that he had more than 50% confidence when he came, and after meeting the President, it increased to 100%. Du Yuming sent Chen Liang, Deputy Commander of the Logistics Headquarters, to Beiping yesterday. At the airport, he also expressed that there is no major conflict in the Northeast at present, and he is willing to talk frankly with Li with great sincerity, hoping to reduce some misunderstandings and conflicts through this meeting, but he said that the opening of the overall situation still has to wait in Nanjing. He also pointed out that the Communist army's active movements in various parts of the Northeast are hindering peace. Among the above-mentioned issues, the exchange of prisoners and overseas Chinese is easy to solve. The government has already drafted a plan for this and sent personnel from the Prisoner and Overseas Chinese Administration to negotiate. As for the power transmission to Shenyang, the Communist Party has sent personnel to inspect the line, and the circuit can be repaired in the short term. Today's Li Minran seems to be completely different from the Li Lisan of the past. He also joked to others: "Although the Li Lisan line of the past was wrong, I will do my best to make the future Li Minran's peace line a success." Ambassador Stuart Leighton took a photo in front of the Mausoleum after visiting the Mausoleum on the 25th (Photo by Central News Agency)</p>

However, the question remains whether the lifting of the suspension will include all supplies or only a portion thereof.

<h3>Zhejiang Local Financial Measures Outline Approved by Administrative Council; Proposal to Establish Yongning County Postponed to Next Meeting</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Hangzhou, 26th Report] The Zhejiang Provincial Administrative Council, chaired by Chairman Shen in the morning of the 26th, continued to discuss financial and land grain proposals. Subsequently, the council, after revising the "Measures for Reorganizing the Financial Revenue and Expenditure System," passed the outline of local financial measures: County budgets should be based on income and expenditure; in addition to reorganizing existing taxes, counties should not establish new taxes, especially not permitted to use "through taxes" and "entry taxes" to eliminate harassment. This point was strongly advocated by Ruan Yicheng, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and adopted by the council; Legitimate county tax revenues should be retained by the county at a rate of 70%, with 30% allocated to the province for unified allocation to remote and impoverished counties; The percentage of county budget should be re-determined, with administrative expenditure accounting for 28%, education and security police each accounting for 24%, construction accounting for 5%, social affairs accounting for 3%, and health accounting for 4%. The salaries of county-level employees and police should be increased, with the province setting standards by region, and each allowed to purchase one shi (about 100 liters) or three dou (about 30 liters) of rice at par value; National education funding, in addition to the amount listed in the county budget, is allowed to be raised by townships, supervised by the province and county; In the initial implementation of the new revenue and expenditure system, if revenue and expenditure are disconnected, the counties should convert part of this year's levied in-kind and pre-borrowed land tax into cash, and borrow funds from banks against the budget revenue, with interest allowed as legitimate expenses. The central proposal in the land grain category, the "Implementation Plan for Zhejiang Province's Current Land Tax and Grain Management Work," was also passed by the council. Its main points are: To reduce the burden on the people, the total amount of regular and additional taxes that originally exceeded one yuan per mu will be capped so the additional taxes do not exceed one times the regular tax; totals below five jiao will remain at the original levels. Every yuan levied will be converted to three dou of in-kind rice, one dou and five sheng of borrowed rice, one dou of public grain, and four sheng of grain husks, totaling five dou and nine sheng. The estimated total levy for the province is 12 million yuan, or 1 million shi of grain; Counties with early rice harvests will start collecting on August 16th, while others will start in September; To build warehouses and transportation plans, urge the payment of overdue taxes, facilitate the people, and regulate food supplies. At noon, Secretary-General Lei convened a discussion meeting, specifically raising the following issues for discussion: The implementation measures for counties to collect in-kind, eliminate malpractices, and benefit the people; To increase the salaries of county-level employees and police; Methods for raising funds for county clearance operations and the repatriation of stray soldiers, it was decided that the provincial government would allocate a total of 100 million yuan, distributed to the counties in ten grades in proportion to county security, population, land, and efficiency, if insufficient, they may apply for a discretionary increase. The cost of food and non-staple food required by stray soldiers will be drawn from the county's accumulated grain stocks, and the cost of travel back home will be allocated by the provincial government. At 8:30 PM, the Zhejiang-Fujian Office of the Good Samaritan Relief Association, and the commissioners and county magistrates of various departments, held a meeting at the provincial government to discuss relief issues throughout the province. Zhejiang Province considers the seven counties of Qingtian, Jinyun, Xianju, Linhai, Huangyan, and Yueqing, which are adjacent areas, difficult to govern, and plans to delineate the boundaries to establish Shuining County, which was submitted to the second discussion of the Provincial Administrative Council for decision, to be established after being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval.</p>

<h3>Basic Chinese Language Invented by Major General Situ; Awarded a Medal by the U.S.</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Hong Kong, 26th] A basic Chinese language system has been invented and will soon be applied to practical Chinese exercises. It is claimed that the system can provide students with practical knowledge of "writing" and "speaking" within three months, whereas the methods currently adopted require at least one year. The inventor is Major General Situ, a Chinese national who was directly ordered by General Stilwell, former commander of the Chinese Expeditionary Force in India, to invent a system to facilitate the training of Chinese officers by Americans during the war. Colonel Haigman, commander of the U.S. Army Guangzhou Detachment, on behalf of the U.S. Army, awarded him a medal for his great achievements. The system has 903 basic Chinese characters, which are essential for daily use, while the estimate of general Chinese teachers is 4,000 to 5,000 characters. Situ began to use this system at the Ramgarh Artillery Training School in India. It is claimed that a U.S. military officer, after studying this method for three months, was able to deliver four consecutive speeches in Chinese. He gave his original manuscript to an American to print a book in the United States, which will be published soon.</p>

<h3>The Future of Palestine</h3>
<p>Palestine has been shrouded in an atmosphere of terror these past few days. On the 22nd of this month, the British military headquarters in the Holy City of Jerusalem, located at the King David Hotel, was bombed, resulting in nearly 150 deaths, injuries, and missing persons, according to British Prime Minister Attlee. The Jewish underground organization Irgun declared to local reporters on the 23rd that they were responsible for the bombing. According to the White Paper issued by the British government on the 24th, the violent acts of Jewish radicals have been continuous since last autumn, with the apparent goal of forcing the British government not to adopt policies contrary to the interests of the Jewish people. Therefore, we dare to say that the dispute between the Jewish and Arab peoples in Palestine, and how it will be resolved, is truly one of the most troublesome problems that Britain has faced since World War II.</p>
<p>After World War I, Palestine was originally a British mandated territory. However, since the report by the joint British-American investigation team after this war recommended that 100,000 Jews be moved to Palestine first, Britain has cleverly pulled in the United States, wanting the United States to support her and jointly solve this difficult problem. Looking into the hearts of the British, perhaps as the British press has stated, Palestine may be divided into Arab and Jewish factions, governed by a central administrative agency, in a similar way to India. This is naturally the most satisfactory wishful thinking for Britain. However, according to reports from Jerusalem, the Arab people firmly oppose the plan to partition Palestine, believing that it is practically impossible to establish two mutually hostile countries within this small land. Even the Jewish people have not given up the idea of relying on their own strength to return to their homeland completely and restore their country. Britain's attempt to please both sides may be met with disapproval from both.</p>
<p>After the war, Britain will feel headache and awkwardness in dealing with the problems of general territories, and the problem of Palestine may not be easier to solve than the problem of India. Although there are conflicts between the Indian and Muslim ethnic groups in India, the conflict between India and Islam superficially makes British rule difficult, but in reality, it may make British rule easier. Because if India and Islam cooperate and unanimously demand independence, then the British government has no reason to interfere in India's politics. Now, although Britain has nominally agreed to India's independence, it cannot actually withdraw its troops, because the British army must build national defense for India externally and maintain order internally. In terms of politics, if India and Islam cannot cooperate for one day, India will not be able to be separated from British rule for one day. Therefore, Britain's power in India is actually built on the contradictions within India.</p>
<p>In Palestine, the situation is very different from that in India. Palestine was originally the homeland of the Jewish people. In the Roman era, the Jews were expelled by the Romans; in the early 16th century, the Arabs occupied Palestine, and it has been so until today. After World War I, after the Executive Yuan approved the British mandate in 1922, the Jews gradually returned to their homeland. However, the Jews are best at business. In any country, as long as the Jews arrive, they will be able to grasp a large amount of local financial resources in a very short period of time. This has been the case in the United States, Germany, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France in the past. The Arabs certainly think they are not their opponents. The Arabs complain that the Jews bought a large amount of their land, leaving them without the means to make a living. This is also true. From 1922 to the end of this war, the conflict between the Arab and Jewish ethnic groups gradually increased. The two things that the Arabs hope for most are: First, to demand the withdrawal of Britain and the establishment of an independent Arab Palestine; second, to ban Jewish immigration. However, last year's report by the joint British-American investigation team advocated allowing 100,000 Jews to immigrate in 1946 and that Britain should continue to administer the mandate. This is exactly the opposite of the wishes of the Arabs. As a result, anti-Jewish movements arose one after another; and the Jewish people also took terrorist actions to deal with it. The situation became more and more intense, almost to the point of being out of control, and Britain suddenly stopped supporting the Jewish people. Foreign Secretary Bevin even publicly stated that he was not prepared to help 100,000 Jews immigrate to Palestine, but instead arrested a large number of Jewish terrorists and imprisoned them. As a result, the Jewish people also revolted against Britain; the British government really felt that it was not pleasing either side.</p>
<p>Britain's position is very painful. She once allowed the Jewish people to restore their country, and she also promised the Arab people unification. These two promises are obviously contradictory, conflicting, and there is no possibility of simultaneous fulfillment. According to Britain's traditional policy of the balance of power, the most ideal is naturally to "divide and rule," allowing the Arab and Jewish ethnic groups to be evenly matched, controlled and ruled by the British, just like Britain treats the Muslim and Indian ethnic groups in India. But now this method is difficult to implement. The Arabs are unified internally and their attitude is firm. Even Arab countries such as Egypt, Syria, Transjordan, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, and Yemen have jointly requested the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the Palestine issue in September. Britain has already felt that it cannot be humiliated. Therefore, it wants to create Arabs temporarily and not allow Jews to immigrate; at the same time, the Jewish people are returning to their homeland, which is justified, and with the support of Jewish groups in various countries, Britain has no way to go back on its word and withdraw its orders.</p>
<p>In this stalemate, the British came up with two solutions. The first is to ask the United States to station troops in Palestine to protect Jewish immigration, because President Truman believes that the promise of allowing 100,000 Jews to immigrate to Palestine should be fulfilled. However, Britain's proposal is clearly putting the blame on the United States. Originally, the United States did not want to rule Palestine. Why should she send troops to cause disputes? Britain's second solution is the current partition of Palestine. According to this method, the Jews and Muslims are divided into two federal states. In the Arab federation, the Jews are not allowed to buy land, so that the Arabs can have a guaranteed livelihood. The Jewish people may agree with this method, but the Arab people have already announced that they do not want it. A nation's wealth is not entirely land. Even if the Jewish people do not buy land, most of the national wealth will still be concentrated in their hands in the future. The Arabs of course understand, so they refuse to recognize the partition. At the same time, what the Arabs demand is independence, and what the Jews demand is also independence. They are unwilling to accept British rule, because they no longer trust the British very much. This naturally makes Britain feel even more depressed. Britain's power in the Middle East will completely collapse in the future because the British army has withdrawn from Iran, Syria, and Lebanon, and may also withdraw from Egypt. In addition, the withdrawal from Palestine will make it impossible to control the Suez Canal.</p>
<p>However, in all fairness, both the Jewish and Muslim ethnic groups of the Republic of China are now going to extremes, and both sides are trying to achieve impossible goals. It is impossible for the Jewish people to ask the Arab people to let them freely immigrate and develop: it is also impossible for the Arab people to completely exclude the Jewish people. Both ethnic groups want to compete for this piece of land in Palestine, and both ethnic groups have no other way out. If you really want to solve this stalemate, perhaps partition and separate independence may be a barely satisfactory solution. Otherwise, even if the British army withdraws, it will not be able to survive if it struggles to the death with each other in the future. Rejecting tigers at the front gate and letting wolves in at the back gate may not have a better future. They should know that any nation, if it cannot unify internally, it will still be very far away to build a truly independent country. In fact, the Jewish and Arab people in Palestine should know this truth, and any nation in the world should be aware of this!</p>
<h3>Regarding the Sugar Price Issue, the Government Announces the Truth (Continued)</h3>
<p>After the establishment of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, in addition to reorganizing factory equipment and planning for restoration, it also received approximately 150,000 tons of sugar left by the Japanese. The corporation was ordered to sell the sugar in Shanghai in accordance with the regulations for the handling of enemy and puppet property. After all of the sugar is sold, it will be able to obtain approximately 200 billion yuan in national currency. After deducting a small amount of transportation costs, all of the money will be turned over to the national treasury. Since the corporation started selling on January 24, it has already deposited approximately 9 billion yuan into a special account at the Central Bank.</p>
<p>The operational guidelines of the corporation, established by the Resources Commission, are: (1) Except for direct allocation to large users and consumer cooperatives, sugar is sold wholesale to sugar merchants and not sold retail; (2) The price must be lower than the market price to stabilize prices.</p>
<p>When the corporation was first established, it originally planned to ship 10,000 tons of sugar from Taiwan to Shanghai every month starting in January. However, in reality, due to transportation difficulties, only 4,500 tons arrived in January, and only 1,500 tons arrived in June, which was far less than the planned quantity. The corporation sold three batches of sugar, totaling 3,300 tons, on May 24, May 30, and June 6, plus 300 tons of refined sugar, totaling 3,600 tons. The wholesale price was 66,000 yuan for all batches, and 66,500 yuan for the third batch. (The first two batches were delivered in Pudong, and the third batch was delivered in Puxi, so 500 yuan was added for transportation costs. In reality, the wholesale price was still 66,000 yuan.) Before May 24, the market price per dan was approximately 70,000 yuan. After the corporation sold sugar, the market price stabilized at approximately 70,000 yuan until June 6. After June, the sugar merchants realized that the corporation's inventory was not abundant, and the market price gradually increased to more than 80,000 yuan per dan. When the fourth batch of sugar was sold on June 14, the number of applications from sugar merchants reached 4,500 tons, which was more than three times the number of applications in the previous three batches. Since the corporation did not have enough inventory to supply, it planned to reduce the sale by 900 tons according to the allocation ratio of the sugar merchants in the first three batches, and temporarily did not sell to the sugar merchants established after the third batch of allocation. The Sugar Industry Association expressed its support for this method. The price was also slightly increased to 73,000 yuan because the market price was already 81,000 yuan. If the corporation still sold at the original price, the citizens would still have to buy sugar at the market price and would not be able to obtain real benefits. It would only cause the government to suffer unnecessary losses, and the sugar merchants would obtain excessive profits.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the corporation did not have enough sugar in stock, and on the other hand, the market price had already exceeded 100,000 yuan. It was deeply concerned that a price that was too low would not only allow sugar merchants to obtain exorbitant profits, but also that the remaining inventory would be completely bought up by the sugar merchants, and the market would be unable to be controlled. Therefore, it had no choice but to directly sell 700 tons on the market at a price of 98,000 yuan on June 20, June 21, and June 22. On the 23rd, it received a telegram from Taiwan stating that the loading of sugar in Taiwan had a definite date, and the demand from all parties was still strong. Therefore, it sold all of the spot goods and presold 3,000 tons of futures at a price of 95,000 yuan, while the market price of spot goods rose to 123,000 yuan. To sum up, the corporation's method of selling sugar is as follows: Except for direct supply to large users, such as sugar companies and consumer cooperatives, the rest are wholesale, and the sugar merchants purchase sugar at a more favorable price than the large users who purchase directly. The corporation also designates special personnel to handle tax certificate procedures to facilitate resale, and the profits of the sugar merchants are very generous; The corporation's reduction in sales in the fourth phase was purely due to insufficient inventory; The corporation's direct sale was a temporary emergency measure. Because there was little inventory left, if the selling price was not appropriately increased, there was a risk that all of the inventory would be sold out, and it would be more difficult to suppress the market increase; The sudden increase in sugar prices in the market this time was due to the understanding of the inventory situation, which caused special fluctuations.</p>
<p>Handling Measures</p>
<p>Based on the results of this investigation, it is believed that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation's original sugar sales method was generally appropriate, but when the market price rose, the corporation failed to take effective measures to consult with local authorities to find ways to suppress it, which was somewhat negligent. However, the corporation's sugar selling price, although lower than the market price, still followed the market price, which was also inappropriate. As for the transportation obstruction, it was the internal reason for the market price fluctuation this time. In order to solve the current and future difficulties, the proposed handling measures are as follows: Improve shipping conditions and strive to achieve the goal of shipping 10,000 tons of sugar from Taiwan to Shanghai every month; The Taiwan Sugar Corporation should aim to price control sugar price and gradually lower the current market price, and it has been decided that the price of the most recent allocation will be reduced to 80,000 yuan. However, in order to prevent market price increases, the Executive Yuan intends to order the Shanghai Municipal Government Social Affairs Bureau to strictly limit retail prices. In the future, the corporation should also supply a fixed amount once a week, and the amount allocated to each sugar merchant may be assigned to the Sugar Industry Association to review on its behalf. The corporation will publish the price and the amount allocated to each party in the newspaper on a regular basis to show credibility; In addition, it can also allocate sugar at any time depending on the market price increases and decreases in order to stabilize the market price; In order to achieve 300,000 tons of sugar production in 1948, the planting area of sugarcane must be expanded this summer. The Taiwan Governor-General's Office convened representatives from the Taiwan Corporation and sugarcane farmers on June 10 to discuss methods to encourage sugarcane planting and actively promote it in July, August, and September of this year; The Taiwan Sugar Corporation originally had a small number of Taiwan private shares. In the recent three to five years, it is not easy to make profits during the construction period, but after the machines are repaired, it will be a profitable business. At that time, it will be possible to absorb more private shares so that the people can share its benefits and recover part of the government's investment. (End)</p>

<h3>International Tribunal Continues to Summon Witnesses: Nanking Massacre Exposed; Japanese Troops' Brutality Unprecedented; Civilian Deaths Reach 200,000</h3>
<p>[Tokyo, 26th Dispatch of the Agency] The Far East International Tribunal continued its hearing today. Dr. Xu Chuanjin testified, describing the atrocities of the Japanese army in Nanking. He stated that after the fall of Nanking in 1937, the Japanese invaders committed atrocities, killing over 200,000 civilians. Countless women were killed or injured, and houses were arbitrarily destroyed or burned. Chinese civilians were killed on sight, and all men of military age were taken away, either massacred by gunfire or burned to death.</p>
<p>[Tokyo, 26th Dispatch of Kaizosha] The Far East International Tribunal held a hearing today on the Nanking Massacre. Chief Prosecutor Keenan reappeared in court today. First, Prosecutor Sadtong continued his direct examination of witness Wilson from yesterday, regarding whether the sale of opium increased or decreased after the fall of Nanking. The witness replied that after the Japanese army occupied Nanking, the number of places openly selling opium increased sharply. He also used opium dens as an example to illustrate how the Japanese army destroyed the security of Nanking. Subsequently, Okamoto, the defense attorney for defendant Mutō, briefly questioned the witness about the situation in hospitals during the fall of Nanking. Then, Ito, the defense attorney for Matsui, the Japanese commander who condoned the massacre, stood up for cross-examination. Ito stated that yesterday the witness said that a certain Chinese woman developed secondary syphilis two months after being raped by Japanese soldiers. However, according to his research, the symptoms of secondary syphilis should only appear three months later, so the woman was not raped by Japanese soldiers. However, because Ito's question had no basis, Wilson was dismissed. Next, Xu Chuanyin, selected by our government to testify, took the stand. Xu, speaking fluent English, first stated his resume, saying that after graduating from Jinling University, he went to the United States to study at the University of Illinois. After returning to China, he worked in the railway industry and is now 62 years old. He then described the Japanese army's massacre at the time in a clear and powerful voice, saying that the Japanese were extremely barbaric, shooting people on sight. Anyone walking on the street, peeking from windows, or trying to escape was shot.</p>
<h3>Rape and Pillage Rampant; Corpses Litter the Streets</h3>
<p>The behavior of Japanese soldiers towards women was unimaginable to the civilized world. I witnessed a woman being violated in a bathroom, naked and weeping. One day, I went to a friend's house and saw eleven people killed. Fourteen-year-old and eleven-year-old girls were violated on the platform, with bloodstains all over it. A family was about to cross the river by boat when Japanese soldiers suddenly came to inspect and saw two young women, who were then subjected to bestial acts in front of their parents and husbands. Furthermore, the Japanese army showed no respect for any private property. They broke into people's homes at will, took away items at will, and then set fire to the houses. Three days after the Japanese army entered the city, I obtained permission from the Japanese army to visit the streets, where I saw corpses lying everywhere, either chopped to pieces or lying on the road in the poses they were killed. I also witnessed Japanese soldiers killing people. I counted the corpses on a certain road, reaching 500, and I could no longer bear to count.</p>
<p>Searching and Gathering</p>
<p>The prosecutor then changed his questioning method to prove how the Japanese army carried out organized massacres. He questioned the witness about the situation of the Nanking Safety Zone International Relief Committee. Xu replied that the Relief Committee sheltered 200,000 to 300,000 homeless refugees. At that time, it was stipulated that anyone carrying weapons was absolutely not allowed to enter the shelter. However, at 8:00 AM on December 14th, high-ranking Japanese officers broke in, saying that Chinese soldiers were hiding in the safety zone, so they came to search. I and the foreign staff all replied that there were no Chinese soldiers in the safety zone. However, the Japanese soldiers came again the next day, wanting to arrest Chinese people in the safety zone. On one occasion, Japanese soldiers came to the safety zone and arrested 1,500 Chinese people. The next day, gunshots were heard near the International Relief Committee. People were sent to investigate, and it was learned that these Chinese people had been killed.</p>
<p>Forced Bowing</p>
<p>At noon on New Year's Day in 1938, I saw Japanese soldiers setting fire to the Soviet embassy, the YMCA, and the houses of other important people. Japanese soldiers, especially sentries, forced the people of the entire city to bow to them. I was also subjected to this kind of behavior, which continued until the ceasefire. I witnessed this attitude of the Japanese army in all the cities I visited (within 200 miles in Anhui Province). (Question) Were there any restrictions on Chinese people in commerce? (Answer) I once transported charcoal to Nanking by boat and obtained permission from a Chinese agent hired by the Japanese secret service because I shared commercial profits with them.</p>
<p>Open Drug Trafficking</p>
<p>(Question) After the fall of Nanking, was opium sold openly? (Answer) After Nanking fell, opium was sold openly, and opium dens were opened. White powder was easier to obtain, and white powder cigarettes were sold, especially to coolies. The Japanese side took this kind of measure to win over the coolies, and even opened sales outlets for this purpose. After the prosecutor finished questioning, defense attorney Kanzaki questioned, is it true that the witness said that the atrocities of the Japanese soldiers continued until the ceasefire? (Answer) The atrocities committed by the Japanese army in the three months after entering the city were very serious, and there were also atrocities later. Three Japanese soldiers went to a village to steal chickens and raped a beautiful woman. Her husband angrily killed two Japanese soldiers. The next day, Japanese soldiers came and forced the men in the village to take them away and shot them with machine guns. (Question) Does the witness know that the Japanese commander sent planes to drop leaflets before entering the city, saying that they would enter the city peacefully? (Answer) I don't know. (Question) Does the witness know that Chinese troops have a habit of committing atrocities and looting when entering and leaving cities? (Answer) Chinese troops have never committed such large-scale atrocities in peacetime without any resistance. (Question) Was there not a single Chinese soldier in the shelter? (Answer) No one carrying weapons. (Question) When Chinese troops retreated, did they not often wear civilian clothes and snipe from cover? (Answer) Such things may have happened, but these people should be regarded as ordinary citizens. Before they reorganize and resist, they are non-combatants. (Question) Were there not countless people like this in the witness's refugee shelter? (Answer) Those who put down their weapons are not regarded as plainclothes soldiers.</p>
<p>Group Massacre</p>
<p>Next, witness Shang Deyi testified. His testimony stated that he was living in the Nanking Refugee Zone at the time. At 11:00 AM on December 16th, he and four other people, including Shi, Cong, and neighbors, were taken to Xiaguan by soldiers who seemed to belong to the Nakajima unit. There were already thousands of men and women there. More than ten machine guns were placed in front. At about 4:00 PM, Japanese officers ordered the machine guns to be fired. The witness fell to the ground before the shooting and was immediately crushed by corpses, losing consciousness.</p>
<p>Next, He Shangde testified. His testimony stated that he had been a police officer. After the fall of Nanking, he and 300 other police officers lived in a brothel. All weapons were handed over to the International Committee and were not armed. The Court of Justice had become a refugee shelter at the time, with many ordinary people in addition to the police officers. On December 15th, the entire group was taken by Japanese soldiers to Xidamen. Several machine guns were placed outside the gate. We were divided into groups of 100, and Japanese soldiers forced us out of the gate with bayonets. As soon as we stepped out, we were shot by machine guns. Those who did not die from the machine gun fire were stabbed to death with bayonets. Of the groups of more than 100 people, 16 groups were killed. The witness fell to the ground in the instant before the machine guns fired and was not hit. Japanese soldiers then stabbed him in the back with a bayonet. The witness did not move. The Japanese soldiers then poured kerosene on the corpses and burned them. It was late at night, and the witness escaped from the scene and went to Dr. Wilson for treatment. About two thousand policemen died this time.</p>
<p>Various Atrocities</p>
<p>Next, Chen Fubao testified. His testimony stated that thirty-nine good people were taken away. Thirty-seven people with hat marks on their foreheads and gun-handling marks on their palms were killed. This happened in broad daylight near the American embassy. Japanese soldiers forced the corpses into the pond. That afternoon, the witness saw three Japanese soldiers raping a sixteen-year-old deaf girl. On December 16th, he was captured by Japanese soldiers again and witnessed Japanese soldiers forcing Chinese people to fight each other, stabbing to death those who lost. That afternoon, he witnessed the burning of hotels and furniture stores on Taiping Road. The Japanese soldiers were Corporal Mabara and Corporal Murakami from the Sangtian team of the Mukai unit. The witness also saw Japanese soldiers raping a pregnant woman on the third day after entering the city.</p>

<h3>Dutch Navy Shells Java; East Indies Federation Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Batavia, 25th Dispatch] The Dutch naval authorities officially admitted that Dutch warships shelled the port of Panarukan in eastern Java. According to Dutch naval officers, after questioning Javanese terrorists who landed in Bali, they learned that Panarukan was the base of Javanese activities, and that many armed men crossed the Bali Strait from there at night. After hearing the news, the Dutch naval headquarters had to take immediate action.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Batavia, 25th Dispatch] Negotiations between Dutch and East Indies representatives in Malino, Celebes, ended today, and they have apparently agreed to form the United States of Indonesia as the basis for future East Indies independence. Representatives from all parts of the East Indies, except Java and Sumatra, participated in the meeting. It has been decided that the United States of Indonesia will be composed of Java, Sumatra, Borneo, and the "Great East." The so-called Great East region refers to Borneo and all the territories belonging to the Eastern East Indies. The various agreements will be further discussed at a meeting in The Hague in September for a final decision.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 25th Dispatch] Dutch sources: The Indonesian Republican authorities have now stopped evacuating Allied detainees from the interior of Java for unknown reasons.

<h3>Establishment of International Civil Aviation Organization; Treaty Approved by US Senate</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 26th Dispatch] The Senate today approved the treaty establishing the International Civil Aviation Organization, allowing the United States to join a world organization that guarantees the orderly and safe development of commercial aviation. The treaty was drafted at the 1944 Chicago Fifty-Six Nation Aviation Conference and will establish an international organization once approved by twenty-six countries. Its permanent headquarters will be located in Montreal, Canada. The organization intends to establish common aviation habits and standards worldwide, but has no economic powers. After the Senate approved the treaty, the State Department withdrew from the "Five Freedoms of Aviation" agreement previously established in Chicago. It is said that this agreement is outdated and unsuitable, and the United States is currently pursuing a plan to achieve freedom of the skies, and will continue to negotiate with various countries to establish bilateral agreements containing the same principles.</p>
<h3>Radius of Death Circle Half a Mile; Repeated Atomic Bomb Tests Prove Terrifying Power Equivalent to 50,000 Tons of TNT</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 26th Broadcast: After a half-hour inspection, Atomic Bomb Test Commander General Blandy said today that if five atomic bombs were dropped on an enemy fleet in a real war, the casualties among the crew would be extremely severe. The results of this test revealed that the force of the blast throwing water into the air was much greater than expected. There are no reports yet on the condition of the animals on the test ships, but if any survived, the ships were stocked with food and drink to last them ten days.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Bikini, 26th Dispatch] The atomic bomb has been definitively proven twice to be able to destroy all kinds of ships within a radius of half a mile. During the shallow-water test in Bikini yesterday, if there were crew members on the target ships, those on deck would have all been killed. This is the careful judgment of Vice Admiral Blandy, commander of the atomic bomb test. Yesterday's test scattered so much radiation that the seawater within 360,000 miles still contained radiation twenty-four hours after the explosion. The "instant death" radius recorded for the aerial explosion of the atomic bomb on this island on July 1st and the atomic bomb test in the sandy land of New Mexico last year was also half a mile. No ships survived within this radius in the two Bikini tests. According to aerial observers, judging from the earlier position of the pontoons, five of the six submarines that sank into the water appeared to have sunk, but Blandy said he could not be sure.</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief Issues Report</p>
<p>If there were crew members below deck on the ships yesterday, most of them would have been injured due to "being shaken during the explosion." In addition, during the explosion, an unmanned plane 6,000 feet above the bomb was also damaged by the explosive force breaking through the water barrier. The bomb used in this test was roughly equivalent in power to the one used in Nagasaki. The reason why not many transport ships and other lighter ships sank was that they were farther from the center of the explosion. Blandy also emphasized that the tidal waves caused by the atomic bomb should not be ignored. This test caused twelve tidal waves, which, although no more than ten feet high, sank a landing craft on Bikini Beach.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Bikini, 26th Dispatch] None of the shallow-water atomic bomb target fleets sank last night. The official number of those already at the bottom of the lagoon remains ten. The lagoon sky and the area surrounding the fleet are still covered in radiation and inaccessible. Scientists predict that this explosion will only kill a small number of fish.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Capital of Colombia, 26th Dispatch] Radio traffic between here and New York was suddenly disrupted today by a mysterious atmosphere. It is generally believed that this blockage phenomenon is the result of the Bikini atomic bomb explosion.</p>
<p>White Birds Unharmed, Lake Fish Suffer</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bikini, 25th Consolidated Power] According to eyewitnesses, the explosive power of this atomic energy was extremely great. According to Laurence, the famous science reporter of "The New York Times" who witnessed four atomic bomb explosions, today's explosive power is equivalent to 50,000 tons of dynamite; this power is enough to flatten an area of ten square miles in a city, about two and a half times the explosive power of the Hiroshima explosion that was previously announced. The atomic energy explosion has two characteristics: In future naval warfare, there will no longer be any need for fleets to fire at enemy ships from the sea to destroy them. It can make seawater more terrifying than acid, releasing radioactive rain that is even more useless dead water, and making it impact the coastline and area behind it from the sky. Two hours after the underwater explosion today, millions of dead fish floated on the surface of the water, and only surviving white birds soared above the coral reefs. Three hours after the explosion, yellow patrol boats, remotely controlled by other ships and aircraft, entered the lagoon to collect samples of radioactive water and air. Lieutenant General Blandy said: The wave that hit three and a half miles away, far from the uninhabited coral beach of Bikini, was about seven to ten feet high. In addition, the green debris floating on the lagoon proved that the atomic bomb had detonated the coral lake bottom.</p>
<p>Starring Boat Destroyed Instantly</p>
<p>[Associated Press, USS McKinley Flagship, 25th Dispatch] The main ship of the atomic bomb test, Medium Landing Craft No. 60, appeared for the first time today. The ship split in one second and was completely destroyed immediately. This ship was one of the most important in the test fleet, as the atomic bomb was attached to the bottom of the ship. The boat also contained the most important electronic equipment, which had never been seen before.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Atomic Bomb Test Viewing Ship USS Appalaichin, 25th Dispatch] The extent of the damage to the target ships in the Bikini Lagoon from the first underwater atomic bomb explosion remains to be determined. What is currently known is that ten warships have sunk to the bottom of the sea. In addition, six other warships were damaged. Scientists and naval personnel entered the lagoon on observation ships within nine hours of the explosion. It will take another three to five days for the target ships to "cool down" until the investigation team can board. A cloud layer thirty miles away, contaminated with fission particles, slowly drifted northwest.</p>
<h3>Two Exiled Kings of Italy and Albania: Unhappy Memories in Egyptian Exile</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Alexandria, 25th] In this ancient city built by Alexander the Great, reside two exiled European kings: former King Zog of Albania and former King Umberto II of Italy. They never meet here, and even if they did, they would not speak.

I also understand that it is not appropriate to implement a measure to increase tax rates while we are striving to increase production. But if this is the only way to avoid the disaster of inflation, then we have no other way to go."</p>

<h3>Broad Daylight Kidnapping in the City Center: Case Solved in Fourteen Hours, Kidnappers Found Feasting with Hostage; Sugar Merchant Xue Jianqiu Has a False Alarm; Principal Offender Zhang Yucan Confesses to Having Served as "Commander"</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Near Jiujiang Road and South Sichuan Road, in the bustling center of the Zhong District, a kidnapping case occurred yesterday morning. The victim was Xue Jianqiu, a sugar merchant from Fujian. Fortunately, the diligent efforts of the city police officers solved the case within fourteen hours, rescuing the hostage and arresting the four principal and accessory offenders. The details of the case are as follows:</p>
<p>Kidnapping</p>
<p>Xue Jianqiu, 33 years old, from Fujian, lives at 99 Hongkou Road, and is a sugar merchant. At around 9:30 a.m. yesterday morning (the 24th), Xue went to the Shanghai Municipal Housing Zoning Committee of the Administrative Yuan on Jiujiang Road and Middle Sichuan Road to visit a friend. As he was going down the stairs on the second floor, two kidnappers lying in wait saw him coming down and immediately pointed guns at him, ordering him not to make any noise. They then hijacked two rickshaws and fled. By about 2:00 p.m. that afternoon, the kidnappers made a phone call (number 42309) to Xue's residence. They told Xue's wife, Xue Xu Peilin (27 years old, from Pei County), that Mr. Xue was suspected of being a traitor and had been detained. If she wanted to resolve the matter, she would have to pay 20 million yuan.</p>
<p>Telephone Agreement</p>
<p>They also agreed to meet Xue Xu Peilin at the entrance of the Tiangong Theater on Xizang Road at around 5:00 p.m. They specified that she should wear a xiangling gauze cheongsam as a sign. Xue Xu Peilin was frightened and bewildered upon hearing this. She went as agreed, but did not see anyone until about 6:00 p.m. There was only a man wearing a Western-style shirt and checkered pants, carrying a raincoat, whispering with a large man wearing a xiangyun gauze shirt and pants. They lingered for a long time before leaving. Shortly after returning home, her husband Jianqiu called, saying, "Quickly raise 20 million, I am safe and sound." At about 8:00 p.m., Xue Xu Peilin and a friend reported the incident to the city police department. Director Zhang of the Criminal Investigation Department ordered Section Chief Feng Junhou of the Second Criminal Investigation Section to investigate overnight and sent female police officer Zhu Liying to disguise herself and wait at Xue's residence to eavesdrop on phone calls and look for clues.</p>
<p>That evening at around 11:00 p.m., the kidnappers called again, saying: "Have the funds been raised? They must be prepared by 12:00 p.m. tomorrow, otherwise Xue Jianqiu's life will be in danger." They also arranged to meet at the entrance of the Xin'cheng Police Station at 10:00 a.m. the next morning to hand over the money, which must be in gold bars and US dollars, not legal tender. Xue's wife was evasive and agreed, saying that she was in the process of borrowing money. By 9:30 a.m. yesterday morning, she suddenly received another phone call, changing the location to the second floor of the Kiesling Café on Nanjing Middle Road and ordering her to be met there.</p>
<p>Deployment</p>
<p>Upon receiving the news, the police department sent Section Chief Feng Qishan and other officers in advance to deploy officers and disguise themselves as waiters, rickshaw pullers, etc., while some pretended to be customers eating breakfast.</p>
<p>About half an hour later, Xue's wife hired a rickshaw and rushed to Kiesling's alone. When she arrived at the entrance, a man wearing white silk shirt and pants, standing on the side of the racecourse, followed her into the building. As soon as she reached the upper level of the stairs, she saw that the customers were seated to full capacity, and she quickly went downstairs, went to room 703 of the nearby Jinmen Hotel, and then went out. The disguised police officers realized that he was suspicious and followed him closely. He headed east to the entrance of the Zhongxing Leather Goods Store at No. 399, South of the Queen Shanghai Opera Theater on Xizang Road. Section Chief Feng and others bravely rushed forward and grabbed him, dragging him into the store and asking where the hostage was hidden. The man only gave his name as Ye Zhou and denied everything else. He was immediately taken back to the police station and detained, while the police continued to return to Kiesling's to observe the situation.</p>
<p>Soon after, another phone call came, specifying that Mrs. Xue should listen to the call and inviting her to the entrance of the Xin'cheng Police Station, where someone would meet her. Section Chief consoled her and told her to go with peace of mind. The surrounding area was also prepared. Xue's wife was confident and walked forward. At the same time, Section Chief and others followed from a distance. After walking a few steps, when they reached Maho Road, a rickshaw sped over and stopped next to Xue's wife. A passenger in the rickshaw invited her to get in. Xue's wife was alarmed but pretended to be calm and agreed to get in. The man handed her a piece of paper written by Xue Jianqiu, which read, "Bring the person who came with you to see me urgently." At this time, Section Chief and three others hired a rickshaw each and followed behind. At the Chengdu Road intersection, the rickshaw turned south, passing the Xin'cheng Police Station to Weihaiwei Road, crossing Chongqing Road to Maho Road.</p>
<p>Arresting the Criminals</p>
<p>The police officers looked around and ordered police chief Bai Wenqi to stop the rickshaw and capture the criminals. They dragged him into a nearby alley and ordered him to confess the whereabouts of the hostage. He claimed his name was Zhang Yucan, also known as Xifu, from Zhuji, and he lived in room 703 of the Jinmen Hotel. He had served as commander of the Zhejiang East Guerrilla Force and was actually a principal offender. He claimed that the hostage was hidden in a large building of a certain agency on Henan Road. The police immediately hired a car from the nearby Antai Car Company and escorted the man back to the police station. The original investigators then went to the above location and rescued the hostage Xue Jianqiu. They also arrested the criminal Zhang Zhenyuan (25 years old, from Ningbo). Zhang claimed that he used to be an adjutant in the army and lived at No. 240 of the New World Hotel. Later, the police rushed to the hotel and waited. Before long, an accessory offender named Gao Zhenyu arrived and was also arrested, and a symbol of the former company commander of the soldiers was found.</p>
<p>According to Xue, after being kidnapped, the criminals took him to the Meihua Restaurant on Nanjing West Road for breakfast, to the Tonglu Wumei Restaurant for lunch, to the Huaan Barber Shop for a haircut, and to the Jinyu Restaurant for dinner in the evening. They claimed to have a signature from a certain Officer Xu of the Xincheng Police Station and went to the Xianle's Dance Hall for a dance. When the dancing was over, they went to the Water Restaurant for a midnight snack. A total of 180,000 legal tender was spent that day, and Xue's diamond ring and gold watch were sold to pay for it. They enjoyed themselves for the whole day until midnight, when he was hidden in this large den of bandits. From being kidnapped to being rescued, it only took fourteen hours. The speed with which the police officers handled the case is evident.</p>
<h3>The Misfortune of Leprosy Patients! Lack of Equipment and Experts; Hospital Reconstruction Lacks Funding: Annual Report of the Leprosy Relief Association</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The terrible disease of leprosy continues to spread around the world, and the number of leprosy patients in our country is particularly high. According to estimates by the medical community, there are as many as one million leprosy patients in China, but there is not a single expert in the treatment of leprosy. In the United States, there are only five or six hundred leprosy patients, but there are dozens of leprosy treatment experts. Since its establishment, the China Leprosy Relief Association has done its utmost to treat leprosy patients in our country and eradicate leprosy, but during the War of Resistance, the Association's Shanghai Leprosy Hospital (in Dachang) was destroyed by artillery fire, and medical equipment was restricted, and it once fell into extremely difficult circumstances. At that time, the mortality rate of the Shanghai Provisional Leprosy Hospital was as high as 19%. After the victory, the general headquarters of the Leprosy Relief Association moved from Chongqing to Shanghai, and the Leprosy Hospital also received medical supplies from abroad, and the mortality rate was reduced to 2%. However, the reconstruction of the Association's official Leprosy Hospital is still extremely difficult. According to an estimate four months ago, the reconstruction cost would be 130 million yuan. The above report was obtained by the reporter at the Association's annual meeting yesterday. The Association held its 1946 annual meeting in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, presided over by Reverend Yao Xianyang, Doctor Diao Xinde, and others. In addition, many foreign members also attended. In addition to reporting on the difficulties of the general headquarters during the war, the conference also elected supervisors. It is also learned that the Association's Shanghai Provisional Leprosy Hospital currently has 51 patients, who are being treated with the injection of the "Dafengzi" Oil and, more recently, with the American-invented Promin injection, but the effectiveness of this drug is still in the testing phase.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Shipping Industry Members' Meeting Agreed to Open the Two Mouths of the Yangtze River; the Relief and Transportation Group Decided to Divide into Six Groups to Expedite the Transportation of Relief Supplies and Righteous People</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association convened its third plenary members' meeting yesterday to discuss the issue of opening the two mouths of the Yangtze River as consulted by President Song, and to strengthen the transportation of relief supplies and righteous people. More than 80 representatives from member companies such as Zhaoxing, Minsheng, Sanbei, Datong, Dada, Tianjin, Zhongxing, Suian, and China Shipping, including Lu Yinggeng, Yang Guanbei, Dong Haoyun, Chen Ganqing, Huang Jiaqiu, Shen Zhongyi, Ding Silan, and Li Yunliang, attended. Yang Guanbei chaired the meeting. First, the issue of opening the two mouths of the Yangtze River was discussed, and unanimous agreement was reached on the proposal passed by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and other groups a few days ago, as well as the temporary designation of Nanjing and Hankou as temporary unloading docks. The main points were that Nanjing and Hankou were temporarily specially permitted for foreign ships coming directly to China to unload relief supplies and government property, and no commercial goods were allowed to be mixed in. However, in order to facilitate the export of local products to reduce the trade deficit, there would be no restrictions on the export of local products. This opinion would be submitted to the government for adoption. The attending representatives expressed their excitement about the government's reconsideration of the four-port trade issue and adoption of public opinion. Subsequently, the discussion focused on strengthening the transportation of relief supplies and righteous people. The representatives expressed their willingness to use all their ships to transport relief supplies and righteous people as much as possible. More than 600 students from the Southwest Associated University and other righteous people awaiting transport in Shanghai will be transported to Tianjin within days. The relief and transportation group of the association will also be responsible for the allocation. It is appropriate that the relief and transportation group of the association is also responsible for the allocation. Currently, there are more domestic steamships and cargo ships, and it was decided to find ways to increase passenger capacity on existing cargo ships as much as possible. Regarding mail transportation, it was also decided that ships on each route should transport as much as possible, and the association would negotiate the price with the Postal Bureau, and the relief and transportation group would coordinate the handling. The proposal passed by the Relief and Transportation Committee that the industry should be divided into groups to undertake relief and transportation work was also unanimously approved. The group division is as follows: 1. China Merchants Group will assign the Si Hai ship as the first relief and transportation group. 2. Private companies will assign the Si Hai ship as the second relief and transportation group. 3. Other irregular coastal ships will form the third relief and transportation group. 4. Regular Yangtze River ships will form the fourth relief and transportation group. 5. Regular ships sailing from Shanghai to Ningbo, Wenzhou, and Minjiang will form the fifth collection. 6. Regular ships sailing on the northern lines will form the sixth group. The profits and losses will be publicly shared, and the relief and transportation group will coordinate the distribution to achieve success. Finally, a representative of the Ping An Shipping Company, Yu Yang, proposed a temporary motion that the sacrifices of the ships of various shipping companies in response to the war of resistance were extremely heavy. The administrative Yuan had previously approved compensation for sunken ships, and the government should quickly implement the compensation. Regarding subsidies to shipping companies, the method of subsidizing Minsheng Company should be used, and subsidies should be provided according to the degree of loss of each company, and loans should be provided for repairing and purchasing ships to facilitate the revival of the shipping industry.</p>
<h3>Inspector Cheng Discusses Some Departments of the Executive Yuan's Organizational Structure Not Meeting Regulations; Investigation of Empty Positions Also Necessary</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to the Da Mei Evening News: Inspector Cheng Zhongxing stated yesterday that the investigation of the "Executive Yuan" is currently being intensified, but no concrete results have been obtained so far. He has requested the Supervisory Yuan to send additional personnel to assist in the investigation. Cheng stated that in addition to thoroughly investigating all accounts of the "Executive Yuan," it is also necessary to investigate the organizational structure of the department, because some departments of the "Executive Yuan" do not meet the original government regulations and have no legal basis. Cheng stated that the results of the investigation will be forwarded by the Inspectorate to the Supervisory Yuan and then to the Supreme National Defense Conference, which will then decide how to handle the "Executive Yuan."</p>
<h3>"Atomic Bomb" Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>After the victory, the citizens of Shanghai have become accustomed to using the newly invented insecticide DDT, but every day at dawn, drowned rats can still be seen along the way, indicating that although the nuisance of mosquitoes and flies has been eliminated, the rat infestation has not been completely resolved. Recently, provinces such as Henan and Shandong have also suffered from rampant plague, with many deaths. However, the American scientific community has indeed invented a highly effective rat poison powder called "Antu." This agent was originally used exclusively by the US military during the war, and after the victory, the pharmaceutical factory was allowed to sell it publicly. This medicine has no smell. However, it has a special toxic chemical effect on rodents. When rodents eat it, they develop a fever all over their bodies, dry throat, and gas within 15 to 30 minutes, and must come out of the hole to drink water and breathe air. As a result, they become increasingly dangerous in the wind and die in water. Before long, they are lying in piles on the open courtyard floor. Since the world has had rat poisons, its effectiveness has been unmatched. Europeans and Americans who have tried this powder call it the "rat atomic bomb," which shows its enormous effectiveness. The powder has recently been shipped to Shanghai by the American Lan Rui Shi Brothers Chemical Factory. The packaging is divided into two types, A and B. Type A can be used four times, and type B can only be used once. Regardless of the old houses where rats gather, if the residents purchase a portion of type A "Antu" rat poison powder, it will be enough to reduce the rat infestation. After the war, rat plagues in various parts of our country this year have made people turn pale at the mention of them, and as a result, they are rushing to purchase "Antu" from the company, competing to be the first. The first batch of goods sold out within ten days, and it is reported that the second batch will arrive in Shanghai at the end of this month. The factory has appointed the Eurasian Trading Company, 3rd Floor, Guangxue Building, 128 Bowuyuan Road, as the manager for China and Hong Kong, with instructions available. Those who request it should attach 20 yuan for postage and it will be sent.</p>
<p>Preventive Measures Require Rat Elimination First</p>
<h3>Two Traitors Given Lighter Sentences; Liu Yangshan Sentenced to Fifteen Years, Qian Xiaomin Sentenced to One Year and Six Months; Judges Explained After Sentencing</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The High Court announced many traitor cases yesterday morning: (1) Liu Yangshan, Deputy Minister of the Pseudo-Central Organization Department and Chairman of the Pseudo-Municipal Party Department, was sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment and ten years of deprivation of civil rights. Liu was a member of the Nationalist Party. Yesterday, he was wearing a blue cloth gown, white pants, and a shaved head. After reading the main text of the judgment, the presiding judge explained to the defendant that if the crime were handled according to the regulations for punishing party members, the sentence would be even heavier. The sentence was now based on the regulations for punishing traitors, which had been greatly reduced. (2) Qian Xiaomin, acting director of the Intelligence Section of the Pseudo-Special Operations Headquarters in Wuxi, was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment and two years of deprivation of civil rights. The presiding judge explained the judgment, saying that the defendant joined the pseudo-government under coercion and had provided some minor services to our underground workers during his tenure in the Special Operations Headquarters, so the sentence was reduced. (3) Shen Junping, a staff member of the Yixing Station of the Pseudo-Special Operations Headquarters, was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment and two years of deprivation of civil rights. (4) Kang Si Danning, Secretary of the Shanghai Office of the Italian Fascist Party, was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment and two years of deprivation of civil rights. Jia Erxi Ai was found not guilty. All the property of the above-mentioned criminals will be confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for their families.</p>
<h3>Li Shiqun's Wife and Pseudo-Official Qian Jieyi's Case Concluded</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Ye Jiqing, the wife of Li Shiqun, the leader of "76," was tried again in the High Court yesterday morning. Her testimony was mostly the same as before, stating that her position as an accountant in the Pseudo-Special Operations Headquarters was because her husband was the deputy director, and for the convenience of going in and out, she also took the name of an accountant, but she actually had no work. She resigned after less than a year. Her position as a member of the Pseudo-Economic Committee was also because Chen Qun's wife was insulted by the enemy gendarmerie on the road, and in order to ensure travel safety, she took a pseudo-official position and obtained a license, but she never attended meetings and did not receive any salary. She never participated in the arrest of people by "76." The case was concluded with arguments yesterday and is scheduled to be announced at 9:30 a.m. on the 31st of this month.</p>

<h3>Regulations for Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation</h3>
<p>The Freedom Protection Association Requests Enactment</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the People's Freedom Protection Association, the state formulates laws to reward good and punish evil, and maintain discipline. Those who commit crimes deserve punishment, but there are also those who are wrongly accused due to various reasons. In the legal system, although there are opportunities for redress such as appeals and retrials, the victims have already suffered mental and material losses. Therefore, the establishment of a system for compensation for wrongful imprisonment is really necessary. In view of this, the association submitted reasons to the highest authorities, requesting the enactment of regulations for compensation for wrongful imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on Newspaper and Magazine Vendors; Industry Meeting Convened</h3>
<p>There Should Be a Flexible Solution</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, hundreds of people from the newspaper and magazine industry in this city held a meeting on the third floor of Guanshengyuan on Nanjing Road.

(3) Whether or not newspapers and magazines should be banned, there are four categories: 1. Those that have been approved and issued registration certificates by the Central Government will of course not be banned. 2. Those that have been transferred to the Central Government by the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs but have not yet been issued registration certificates will not be banned temporarily. 3. Those who have not applied to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs at all. 4. Those that have been approved, but publish obscene and lewd words that are sufficient to affect morals and security.

<h3>Huang Xianggu and Others' Proposal for Retrial</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, the High Court retried Rao Shu, who is from Wuhu and is 54 years old. He has been a professor at Mailun College and Jinan University for many years. After the "September 18th" Incident, he joined the Military Statistics Bureau. He was arrested by the Pseudo-Special Operations Headquarters in September 1939 and defected to the pseudo-government, serving as the chief of the Second Section of the Second Division of the Pseudo-Special Operations Headquarters, responsible for international intelligence. Later, he was transferred to be the deputy district chief of the Wuhan District, contacting Goshima Shigeru, the section chief of the Hankou enemy gendarmerie, and specializing in arresting our underground workers. When Goshima Shigeru was transferred to Shanghai as the chief of the police affairs section of the Pseudo-Police Bureau in September 1942, Rao also came to Shanghai to work in the Pseudo-Police Bureau as deputy chief. Yesterday, the defendant argued in court that he originally planned to assassinate Li Shiqun, but he was arrested due to the lack of secrecy. In order to cope with the environment, he took a pseudo-official position, but he had rescued underground workers such as Lin Yin and Chen Shihua during his tenure. The court ordered an adjournment for further questioning.</p>
<p>On the same day, the cases of Zhou Wenrui, director of the Finance Bureau of the Pseudo-Dadao Municipal Government and director of the Pseudo-Municipal Sports Association, Yang Yongrui, a liaison officer of the Pseudo-Jiangyin Oil Industry Association, and Hu Zhanggen, etc., were also heard and adjourned for further questioning.</p>

<h3>The Bandit Who Shot the Pilot Executed on the Gallows; An Accomplice Sentenced to Long Imprisonment</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The bandit Xuan Changgen was sentenced to death by the local court for repeated offenses. After review by the Supreme Court, the sentence was confirmed. He was executed at the gallows in the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison at 7 a.m. yesterday. The prosecutor of the local court, Chuan Bang, visited the site to supervise the execution.</p>
<p>The criminal was originally scheduled to be executed by shooting, but because there was no suitable execution site in the prison, hanging was used instead. The four Japanese war criminals who were sentenced to death by hanging by the US military court a few months ago were executed on the same gallows.</p>
<p>The bandit was 27 years old, from Shanghai, and lived at No. 10 Shipin Lane, Nanshi. After the victory, he committed robberies in this city with accomplices, committing as many as eleven cases. He also shot and killed a victim, pilot Wang Ji. His last crime was robbing Sun Shixian's family at No. 56 Duofuli, 504 Zhengdong Road. After the victim reported to the police bureau, the accomplice Zhang Yunsheng and others were arrested in the Vanhuangdu Heping Hotel. Based on the clues, Xuan was finally captured at No. 10 Xinyong Street, and was sentenced to death by the local court after questioning. The accomplice Hu Cailin was sentenced to life imprisonment, and Zhang Yunsheng was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment.</p>
<p>At 6 a.m. yesterday, Prosecutor Chuan Bang, accompanied by Police Chief Chen, Pan Yuyi, Squad Leader Lang Qinyi, Xu Xuanlin, Zhang, and several bailiffs, rushed to the Shanghai Prison, brought out Xuan Changgen, and escorted him to the gallows. The bailiffs covered his head with a black cloth and hung his neck on the gallows. His feet were exposed on a specially made movable iron plate. After the supervising officer gave an order, he moved the electric button, the iron plate fell downward, the criminal was suspended in the air, and he died within a few minutes. After verification, the body was sent to the Hede Road autopsy site to be claimed by his family.</p>
<h3>Electing a "Miss Shanghai" is Another New Plan to Help Refugees in Northern Jiangsu; Bathhouses Throughout the City Are Also Willing to Do Their Best</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fundraising Committee of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association plans to elect a "Miss Shanghai" to help with the disaster relief. This proposal has been approved by Du Yuesheng, the chairman of the association, and Wu Kaixian, the vice chairman. However, due to the large scope, it is not easy to hold it centrally, so the various plans are still being drafted. It is understood that it is planned to divide Miss Shanghai into four groups: (1) Ladies from noble families, (2) Movie stars, (3) Singers, (4) Dance stars. Each group will be elected separately. The election tickets will be priced at 5,000 yuan each, and all income will be used for disaster relief in Northern Jiangsu. The address is set at "New Senlin Night Flower Garden", and the date is tentatively set for mid-next month. The association will invite all relevant parties for detailed discussions in the near future. In addition, eighty-one bathhouses throughout the city are also scheduled to hold a charity sale on August 1, and all proceeds will be used to help with disaster relief.</p>

<h3>Increased Property Tax to Fund the Epidemic Prevention Committee</h3>
<p>The Epidemic Prevention Committee believes that the epidemic prevention expenses required this year are huge. In addition to the 446 million yuan that has been approved by the Municipal Government, there is still a shortfall of 702 million yuan. After discussion by the Fundraising Committee, in addition to launching a donation campaign to various associations for approximately 200 million yuan, the remaining amount will be requested from the authorities to increase the property tax by 50% this week (April, May, and June), which is expected to generate an income of 450 million yuan to make up for the shortfall. This case was approved by the Municipal Government meeting yesterday and a letter was sent to the Municipal Temporary Council for review.</p>
<h3>Measles and Smallpox Rampant in Northwest Shanghai</h3>
<p>In the northwest of Shanghai, measles and smallpox have been rampant recently. The dangerous situation is worse than the epidemic at the time, and the mortality rate is far higher than that of cholera.

<h3>Heavy Burden of Land Tax in Kind; Fellow Villagers in Shanghai from Zhejiang Appeal</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Fellow villagers associations in Shanghai from various parts of Zhejiang believe that the government's implementation of land tax in kind places a particularly heavy burden on Zhejiang Province. Landlords actually receive less than four dou of rent rice per mu, while the land tax requires more than seven dou of grain per mu, which is particularly unreasonable. In addition to sending representatives to Hangzhou to petition, they have also sent telegrams to Chairman Jiang of the Provincial Government, President Song of the Executive Yuan, President Sun of the Legislative Yuan, the Central Party Department, and the National Political Council to appeal.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Industry Appeals</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Rickshaws are an outdated and unreasonable means of transportation. The existence of rickshaws is enough to hinder modern urban traffic. Therefore, the Ministry of Social Affairs ordered the competent authorities in various places to eliminate rickshaws within three years. This city will gradually eliminate them by reducing one-third each year, implemented by the Public Works Bureau. In addition to prohibiting new car registration, it has been decided to reduce one-tenth of them first in the autumn of this year. It is also heard that Chairman Jiang recently ordered the Ministry of Social Affairs to shorten the elimination period to two years. However, the rickshaw industry association, in view of the serious unemployment problem of the large number of rickshaw pullers, has separately submitted letters to the Municipal Public Works Bureau, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Social Affairs requesting the withdrawal of the order, but has not received any reply so far. The rickshaw industry association is now preparing to organize a rickshaw pullers' vocational association and a rickshaw mutual aid association and other organizations to appeal to the authorities again.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The new mail ship General Gordon, managed by the American President Lines, arrived in port for the first time from the United States this Tuesday, carrying more than 600 passengers. The ship was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai this morning for Hong Kong, via Singapore, Little Luzon, and Bombay, and return from Bombay to Hong Kong, directly to New York. It is now learned that due to the inconvenience of loading and unloading goods, it will not be able to depart on time and has been decided to postpone the departure until 2 p.m. next Monday. It is reported that the number of departing passengers on the ship is even greater than the number of passengers arriving in Shanghai. As of yesterday, there were already more than 800 registered passengers, of whom about 285 were Jewish refugees, who will transfer to Australia in Hong Kong. More than 40 US troops are being transferred to Little Luzon, and the famous South China football team, a group of seventeen people, will also return to Hong Kong on the ship. The company's prepared passenger boat will depart from the New Customs Wharf every fifteen minutes starting at 8:15 a.m. this morning to pick up passengers and send them to the ship. There will be no passenger boats in the afternoon, and it is not yet determined whether there will be passenger boats to pick up passengers tomorrow and the day after.</p>
<h3>Soviet Ship Smornany Suffers Damage to the Stern and Breaks Down</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The China Merchants Bureau's Zhongkai ship, on its return trip from Tianjin to Shanghai on the 23rd of this month at around 5 p.m., was docking at the Jinliyuan Wharf. While passing through the Pudong area of the Xinkai River, it accidentally collided with the nearby Soviet ship Smornany. The Zhongkai ship accidentally collided with the stern of the Soviet ship Smornany, damaging two iron plates. Fortunately, they were above the waterline and there was no major problem. The agent of the ship, Mao Tai Yanghang, immediately negotiated with the China Merchants Bureau, which ordered the Pudong Shipyard to send craftsmen to repair it. According to the shipyard's estimate, it will take at least three days and nights to repair it. However, the Soviet ship is scheduled to depart this morning to return to Vladivostok and cannot wait. Therefore, the China Merchants Bureau informed Mao Tai Yanghang by letter to inform the Soviet ship that it would be allowed to repair it when it comes to Shanghai next time. It is also learned that Mr. H. Tarby, the warehouse supervisor of the British Swire Shipping Company, a Danish national who has served Swire for more than 50 years, has applied for six months of leave this time and is scheduled to take the Soviet ship with his wife to Vladivostok this morning, via Moscow, to return to England.</p>
<h3>Abetting Evil and Disrupting Finance; The High Prosecutor's Office Accuses Qian Daqi</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Qian Daqi, the deputy governor of the "Pseudo-Central Reserve Bank," has been formally prosecuted after the High Prosecutor's Office concluded its investigation of his crimes.

<h3>Ministry of Education Convened Higher Education Conference: Maintain Chief Instructor System, Strengthen Guidance Work, Determine Nature and Organization of Student Self-Government Associations, Relax Restrictions on Self-Funded Students Studying Abroad, Abolish University Graduate Schools, and Establish Research Institutes Instead</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing newspaper] The Ministry of Education believes that the organization and staffing of higher education, specialized schools, and various departments, as well as the revision of curricula, all require extensive discussion to achieve appropriate improvements. Therefore, on the 24th, it convened relevant educators and experts in the Ministry's conference room to discuss these issues from 9 AM to 1 PM and from 4 PM to 7 PM. Those present included Jiang Fuzong, Shen Fei, Qi Nan, Tian Peilin, Chen Yuguang, Zhu Kezhen, Wu Zhenghua, Zhou Minsheng, Dong Xixian, Zhu Guozhang, Xin Shuzhi, Du Dianying, Zhu Hengbi, Wu Junsheng, Lin Jing, Zhou Junshi, Mao Yisheng, Meng Xinru, Zhou Hongjing, He Shijun, Gu Shusen, Ling Chunsheng, Chen Yongling, and Zhang Wencai, totaling more than 20 people. Vice Minister Zhu Jingnong presided over the meeting.</p>
<p>Initial Proposals</p>
<p>The proposals mainly concerned the improvement of the university education system. The experts, recognizing the importance of the matter, spoke enthusiastically. The main topics discussed included seven cases: (1) Should the Chief Instructor system and the tutor system be continued? (2) How should the University Affairs Council be organized? (3) Should the title of Chief of General Affairs of various universities be changed? (4) How should the teaching hours of presidents be strictly limited? (5) Should self-funded students be allowed to study abroad only after passing an examination? (6) Should students studying abroad be limited to graduates of schools above the specialized school level? (7) How should the number of teachers and salary standards be determined? All of the above cases were thoroughly reviewed and concrete conclusions were reached. However, it is still necessary to gather more opinions and conduct a final review before a final decision is made. No announcement will be made until then.</p>
<p>[Another report] The experts attending the Higher Education Discussion Conference convened by the Ministry of Education on the 24th are all personnel engaged in practical educational work. According to sources present, everyone offered opinions on higher education that day, suggesting that the Ministry review and consider them. Regarding the Chief Instructor system and the tutor system, the general opinion was to maintain the Chief Instructor system and establish a Guidance Committee to strengthen guidance work, abolish the current tutor system, strengthen the leadership of professors in each department over students in their respective departments, and increase their responsibility for guiding students in their academic and life matters. It was also decided to define the nature of student self-government associations, improve their organization, and strengthen their work. Regarding the organization of the University Affairs Council, the president, provost, chief instructor, chief of general affairs, and deans of each college would be ex officio members, and several representatives would be elected by the professors (the number of professor representatives should at least exceed the number of ex officio members, but should not exceed twice the number of ex officio members). The president would serve as chairman, and all important matters of the school would be discussed. In addition, an administrative meeting would be established, consisting of the president, provost, chief of general affairs, and deans of each college. This meeting would assist the president in handling matters related to the execution of school affairs. The title of Chief of General Affairs of various universities would remain the same, but it could not be held concurrently by a professor. The teaching hours of teachers would remain at nine to twelve hours per week as originally stipulated; those teaching less than nine to twelve hours would be considered part-time teachers. As for self-funded students studying abroad (restrictions will be relaxed next time, and detailed measures will be formulated separately).</p>
<p>Proposals for the Following Day</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing, 26th] The Higher Education Conference continued to be held at the Ministry of Education yesterday (25th) in the morning and afternoon. The Minister of Education presided over the meeting. There were four proposals for discussion: (1) Should the study period for students in engineering colleges be extended? (2) Should the University Organization Law and the Specialized School Organization Law be revised? (3) Should university law schools focus solely on cultivating legal talent, and should separate colleges be established for the economics and political science departments? (4) Should the name of university graduate schools exist, and how should the treatment of graduate students be regulated? The resolutions were: (1) The study period for students in engineering colleges may be extended by one year, with internships at the beginning of their studies. However, at the initial stage of recovery, various factories have not yet fully recovered, so this matter must wait until a suitable time to be implemented. (2) The University Organization Law and the Specialized School Organization Law were promulgated in 1929. After so long, there is now a need for revision. However, this is a major undertaking, involving a thick volume of regulations. After detailed discussion, a general outline was drafted, and further discussion will continue today. (3) The names of university graduate schools and research departments should be abolished, but research institutes may be established, with the heads of each college and department serving concurrently as directors, to facilitate close connections. Research institutes may recruit graduate students, who will enjoy research benefits and receive research subsidies. (4) Regarding the issue of university law schools, the resolution was: (a) Those with the original four departments of law, political science, economics, and sociology will remain as they are. (b) Those with only a pure law department will be called the Law School. (c) Law schools with both law and political science and economics departments may establish a separate College of Political Science and Economics, depending on actual needs, but this must be submitted for inspection and approval based on the actual situation. The meeting will continue in the Ministry of Education conference room today (26th). If there are no temporary proposals, the meeting will be adjourned.</p>

<h3>Party-State Elder Chu Fucheng Painstakingly Discusses the Current Silk Cocoon Crisis; Silk Factories Plan Two Relief Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Chu Fucheng, a senior member of the Kuomintang (KMT), was recently elected as the chairman of the Third District Sericulture Industry Association. The association's members include all silk reeling factories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and the cities of Nanjing and Shanghai. It is a large organization and the only group organization in the domestic sericulture industry. Our reporter interviewed Chu at his residence yesterday to inquire about the current situation of the silk industry. Chu told the reporter in an earnest tone: China's silk industry is currently facing a serious crisis. Farmers raising silkworms have often lost money from their production. The market price of improved silkworm eggs is now over 20,000 yuan per sheet. The highest price for mulberry leaves for feeding silkworms has also reached over 20,000 yuan per dan. It is estimated that each sheet of improved silkworm eggs can produce 60-70 jin of dry cocoons, and each sheet of silkworm eggs requires 7-8 dan of mulberry leaves.</p>
<p>Cost to Silkworm Farmers is 200,000 Yuan per Dan</p>
<p>Based on this ratio, the cost for silkworm farmers to produce one dan of dry cocoons is about 200,000 yuan. However, the purchase price of dry cocoons from improved silkworm eggs is at most 150,000 yuan per dan, so silkworm farmers feel they are losing money significantly. In terms of factory silk, the price of our country's medium-grade factory silk currently exported to the United States is about 2.12 million yuan per dan. However, the cost of reeling one dan of factory silk is currently 2 million yuan for the cocoons alone, and the reeling labor, interest, and losses account for about 1.5 million yuan. Therefore, the cost of each dan of factory silk has reached 3.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Manufacturers Must Lose 1.45 Million Yuan per Dan</p>
<p>Compared with the current market price of factory silk, each dan must lose 1.45 million yuan. Moreover, for this spring cocoon loan, the manufacturers themselves must fill 30% of the base capital in order to borrow 70% of the loan. If the factory silk is sold at the current market price, even if the 30% base capital is exhausted, it will not be enough to compensate for the losses, let alone talk about export competition. The silk factories deeply feel that the current crisis is severe.</p>
<p>Representatives Have Been Appointed to Petition the Government</p>
<p>Therefore, it has been decided to send representatives such as Leng Yuqiu to the government, together with the authorities of the China Silk Company, to formulate opinions and go to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in Nanjing to request relief. It is now heard that the silk factory industry has formulated two opinions on relief measures: (1) The factory silk that each silk factory has reeled will be purchased by the government in a unified manner, and then ways will be found to export it. (2) Each silk factory will find ways to negotiate exports on its own, and the government will supplement it with export subsidies. Chu further stated: It is hoped that the government can make definite regulations on relief measures before the end of this month so that each manufacturer can start preparing to buy autumn cocoons at the beginning of next month.</p>
<p>Failure to Provide Prompt Relief Will Affect Autumn Cocoons</p>
<p>Otherwise, if the relief method is not determined, the silk that the manufacturers have already reeled will still be unable to be resolved, let alone buy autumn cocoons. The impact will be that no silkworm farmers will be willing to cultivate the autumn silkworms that will be on the market in early September. Therefore, the speedy determination of relief measures is an urgent matter.</p>
<h3>Gold Price Drops Sharply, Affected by Hong Kong Gold Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 烚赤 (a type of gold) suddenly fell sharply. Securities firms immediately opened up sales. From an opening of 1.945 million in the morning, it gradually fell to around 1.92 million before stabilizing slightly. After 10:00 AM, the central government distributed 111 bars at a price of 1.9275 million. Afterwards, supply was limited, and it remained around 1.93 million. Around noon, it rose slightly to 1.935 million. In the afternoon, news came from Hong Kong that the gold price had plummeted. Guangdong firms urgently offered sales, and the futures also fell to around 1.885 million. As a result, it closed down 60,000 from the previous day. Ornaments were listed at 10,300. Both standard silver and silver dollars were flat. The underground interest rate was flat, with interest rates ranging from 10.5% to 14%.</p>

It finally hovered around 720 yuan, closing down 30 yuan from the previous day. Bonds A and B rose slightly by 40 yuan. Bond D was flat, and Bond E also rose by 30 yuan.</p>
<p>Dried Lily Buds Further Weaken</p>
<p>Since the new dried lily buds have come out, the range between the high and low prices has fallen by almost half. Although it rose slightly a few days ago, it soon softened again. This is because shipments have recently arrived from Zhenjiang, with dry and beautiful goods, and the asking price is cheap. The higher price is only 165,000 yuan, and the average is less than 160,000 yuan. Sales have remained sluggish recently, and it is not easy to improve in the short term.</p>
<h3>Covering Shorts, Major Players Push Up, Chinese Stocks Initiate Another Surge</h3>
<p>After several days of weakness, the market rebounded yesterday, covering short positions. Once there was a change, a surge in momentum occurred. Credit conditions were extraordinarily loose, and buying sentiment was strong. A major player, Mr. Yang, deliberately pushed up prices. Yong Yarn rose gradually from 635 yuan, Meiya from 4,200 yuan, Jingfu from 233 yuan, Xinguang from 225 yuan, and Dongxing from 163 yuan. Near noon, all presented high prices. Yong Yarn saw 690 yuan, Meiya 4,700 yuan, Jingfu 270 yuan, Xinguang 263 yuan, and Qinxing 205 yuan. The noon close was slightly stable, with Yong Yarn and Meiya rising by about 10% compared to the previous day's close. Jingfu, Xinguang, and Quanxing each rose by 10% to 20%. Unpopular medium and small-sized stocks were slightly stable, while small-sized stocks recovered about half. Veteran stocks were flat.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were initially flat and then stable, but transactions remained low. Yisha opened at 8,600 yuan and Yinglian at 8,800 yuan, and both rebounded slightly. The speculative atmosphere was extremely weak, and the gains were far less than those of Chinese stocks. Other small stocks showed mixed gains and losses. Some closed early and had not yet recovered. As a result, Yisha declined slightly compared to the previous day's close. Wheelock Marden and Steel were flat. Yeguang Paper, Shipping, Yisha, and Yinglian each rose by about 5%.</p>

<p>In order to promote production, the financial community in the city is currently planning to organize a large-scale industrial investment syndicate, which will be jointly organized by major commercial banks. The allocation of syndicate funds and the investment targets are being carefully planned.</p>
<h3>Silk Exports to be Subsidized</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The silk factory previously stated that the cost was higher than the selling price, making it impossible to maintain production, and applied to the government for relief. It is now known that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has prepared a memorandum agreeing that the government should adopt export subsidies.</p>
<h3>Yarn, Cotton, and Cloth Transactions Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market became increasingly unsustainable. Double yarn initially traded at 380,000, but it was the end of its strength. It soon fell to 1.32 million. Sales remained sluggish, especially for medium and small sizes. There was supply but no demand, and prices fell by 30,000 to 40,000. Double-strand yarn also fell by 50,000 to 60,000. Transactions were quite rare. At noon, the Fangjian Company opened yarn sales as usual, offering 20-count yarn in both Lanfeng and Shuiyue varieties, with prices 20,000 lower than the previous auction.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York American cotton wire continued to fall wildly by 100 points, with near-term old cotton at 33.38, far-term new cotton at 30.13, and Middling spot at 34.06.

However, the Shenxin No. 1,253 Factory still purchased fine-staple raw material Middling, while other factories and the Fangjian Company remained wary.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market was bleak, with plentiful spot goods and weak actual demand. It was difficult to cover general floating positions. Serge fell by 1,500 yuan, and gray cloth was also restrained, falling by 500 yuan to 750 yuan, but bleached cloth and Shilin cloth were slightly flat.</p>

Yesterday, only 10 packages of 7.5-quality high-uniformity silk were traded at 2.05 million yuan for a 10-day bill. Dry silk also lacked interest. Meiya silk and Dajie Grid crepe were not traded in the market. Asking prices were slightly weaker than the previous day. Huajin silk, due to abundant spot goods and uneven stock, was priced lower.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Flour and Timber Imported</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Weston, managed by Jardine Matheson, imported 5,255 tons of flour, 1,214,700-plus feet of timber, and 4,000-plus tons of sundries from Vancouver.

High-quality Japonica rice was still selling well, while medium and low-quality rice was dull and flat. Indica rice sales were sluggish and still in a weak state. White rice was also quite sluggish, and arrivals were gradually scarce. However, digestion was normal, and it was not easy to prosper. The situation was about to become a state of neglect. After continuous weakness, flour was opportunistically absorbed by shops, and digestion became active, rising slightly by 100 yuan. Wheat bran was in short supply, and prices were tight. Shantou wheat was active but not prosperous. Ningbo stopped buying, and the situation was still high and strong, but lower-quality wheat was dull. Soybeans rose by 400 to 500 yuan due to slight inquiries from Shantou and oil mills also showing interest. The oil market rose step by step due to smooth buying by Guangdong firms, and the arrival of Qingdao goods was still scarce.

<p>Local stores and the merchant guilds’ domestic sales of black and green tea have not decreased. The market is active and vibrant, and prices are stable. In particular, the buying sentiment for Taiwan Chen black tea is even stronger. However, the source of this product has been scarce for a long time, and the local inventory has decreased. The new products from the producing areas are sold for as much as 120,000 to 130,000 yuan per phase. Therefore, those who hold the goods are pushing up the prices. As a result, medium-grade goods have soared to 62,000 yuan per dan. High-quality goods are offered for sale at 70,000 yuan, all of which are unprecedented high prices. As for the foreign tea market, Jardine Matheson, Wang Yutai, Wuchang, and other export houses are searching everywhere for old export tea, as the market conditions are still suitable. A total of no less than 400 to 500 boxes of Chen Zhong Qimen, Chen Zhong Chouzhen, and Chen Te Gong have been traded throughout the city.</p>

<h3>UK Borrows Heavily from the United States</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Ding Weidong Reporting from Nanjing on the 16th of This Month</p>
<p>After heated debate, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the "Anglo-American Financial and Trade Agreement" on July 13th by a vote of 219 to 155. The agreement stipulates a loan of 3,750,000,000 US dollars to the UK in exchange for the UK abandoning "Imperial and Sterling Area preferential tariffs." This agreement between the UK and the US was approved by the Senate as early as May 10th. After its passage by the House of Representatives, it was signed by President Truman on July 15th. In today's international situation, where clear divisions and tensions are pronounced, the establishment of this loan agreement has a significant impact on the world situation.</p>
<p>Loan Negotiations Experience Twists and Turns</p>
<p>Tracing the history of this loan, negotiations began in the winter of last year. At that time, the British and American administrative authorities had clear understanding and sufficient sincerity, but public opinion differed greatly. On the American side, it was believed that Britain had always been cunning and untrustworthy, and might obtain the loan but cancel tariffs. Promises of non-discrimination might not be fulfilled. In fact, this concern still exists today. The most obvious example is that during the passage of the agreement in the House of Representatives, some members argued that the UK should first be allowed to withdraw one billion US dollars, with the remaining loans allowed only when the UK showed that it could indeed fulfill its promises. At the same time, some unenlightened American financial capitalists also opposed the Anglo-American loan. They believed that after the British government obtained this huge sum, it would inevitably implement large-scale socialization plans domestically; if socialization plans were highly successful in Britain, the social foundation of American capitalism would be fundamentally affected and shaken. With the American attitude like this, general British public opinion was also deeply dissatisfied with the terms of the loan. Many people in Britain believed that this loan would be best if given as a gift, or at least as an interest-free loan. However, the United States now insists on interest, which has caused great dissatisfaction in British public opinion. The influential "London Economist" magazine stated, "Our current needs are the direct result of our earliest, longest, and most intense war effort... but we have to pay 140 million US dollars in interest every year!" The British newspapers compared the United States to the Jewish merchant in Shakespeare's plays. Conservative Party members believed that Britain's abandonment of the Imperial Preference system was equivalent to abandoning the last line of defense of the imperial economy, amounting to an excessive concession, and thus strongly opposed it. However, the fact that Britain needed this huge sum of money was undeniable, and the United States, for political and economic reasons, was also willing for the negotiations to succeed. After several rounds of compromises, the representatives of both sides finally concluded an agreement in Washington on December 6th last year. The total amount of the loan was 4.4 billion US dollars. At the same time, the UK's 2.5 billion US dollar debt under the Lend-Lease Act was cancelled. After deducting some cash, the actual loan amount was 3,750,000,000 US dollars. The loan term was 50 years, with an interest rate of 2%, payable from December 31, 1951. A week later, on December 14, the British Parliament accepted the terms of the loan and also passed the Bretton Woods International Monetary Fund plan. Sir Keynes, the British representative who bore the heavy responsibility of negotiation, later inserted a sentence in a British broadcast, praising American friendship: "I happened because of the joint war effort; but they are concerned about Britain's recovery!" It is not difficult to see from the implication that Britain was seeking compromise in the loan negotiations.</p>
<p>Making Concessions with Great Difficulty</p>
<p>Why did Britain make concessions to ensure the success of the negotiations? The most fundamental reason is that Britain won this war, but it bankrupted itself. Since industrialization in the 18th century, Britain has now for the first time fallen from the position of a creditor nation to that of a debtor nation. As of the end of last year, Britain's total debt reached 15,200,000,000 US dollars. Among them, 10,920,000,000 US dollars are debts owed to various countries within the Empire, with the largest creditors being India and Egypt, the former reaching 4,700,000,000 US dollars and the latter reaching 1,700,000,000 US dollars. Debts outside the Empire also reached 4,280,000,000 US dollars, with the United States, Argentina, and Portugal being major creditors. During the arduous years of war, Britain sacrificed 60% of its export trade, one-third of its overseas assets, and one-quarter of its ships as the price of survival. Churchill once said in Parliament: "During this war, Britain sacrificed everything," which is indeed not an empty phrase!</p>
<p>Due to these painful losses, Britain has won, but is very tired; and the difficulties of demobilization and reconstruction are numerous and yet to be overcome. First, the termination of the US Lend-Lease Act makes the food problem in the British Isles very serious. In the future, Britain must use a large amount of funds to purchase food and clothing overseas to feed its people. The recovery of Britain's export industry will still take considerable time. During the negotiations in Washington, the representatives of both the UK and the US estimated that there was no hope for a balance in the UK's revenue and expenditure for at least three years. Moreover, within the British Empire, India and Egypt are major creditors. Even if Britain exports goods to these two countries, the two countries do not necessarily have to export goods to Britain. Secondly, Britain urgently needs American loans as capital for recovery and reform. Among the reconstruction efforts, the most important is to modernize British industry. Britain industrialized earliest, but due to the prudence and conservatism of the national character, and the self-imposed limitations of capitalists, the degree of industrial modernization is now far inferior to that of the United States and Germany. During this war, the American industrial community organized a delegation to visit Britain to inspect British industry. They found that British workers' wages were at least one-third lower than those in the United States, which is a natural advantage of British industry; however, the production efficiency of British industry is far lower than that of the United States, with estimates that the average efficiency of the United States is more than two and a half times higher than that of Britain. Britain is clearly lagging behind in large-scale production. For example, the production cost of automobiles in Britain is twice as high as in the United States. Therefore, British industry must be modernized, otherwise it will be impossible to improve export trade. To modernize industry, it is necessary to obtain American friendship and assistance. Because the required capital is too large, Britain cannot bear it alone. Finally, the British Labor government wants to implement a socialization plan, gradually nationalizing the coal and iron industries while actively modernizing them, and at the same time implementing life insurance to stabilize people's lives; these reforms all require huge sums of money. Based on the above three reasons, it is no wonder that the British Chancellor of the Exchequer frankly stated in Parliament: "Britain's future financial plans depend on the success of the American loan. If it is not successful, Britain can only lower the people's living standards and strengthen trade controls to overcome this post-war difficulty." In fact, Britain's food problem is quite serious, and the Imperial Preference agreement is no longer reliable. Because Britain's position in the Sterling Area has been greatly weakened due to debt, and Britain cannot have a large amount of exports in the short term to exchange for the import of unnecessary goods. Therefore, borrowing from the United States is the only feasible strategy; another undesirable strategy is to submit to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Truman Signs the Major Loan to Britain (Special Dispatch from The New York Times)</p>
<p>American Views Shrouded in Worry</p>
<p>As for the United States' willingness to lend such a huge sum of money to Britain, whose interests are not entirely consistent, there are also major economic and political reasons. Economically, the productivity of American industry has increased dramatically due to the stimulation of the war, and the recovery work has been unusually smooth. Therefore, the American social economy has entered an unprecedented stage of prosperity, similar to the situation after the First World War. Due to the lessons of past history, the United States is always in the process of preventing the arrival of a recession, and the best preventive medicine is to open up more overseas markets. Before this war, the British Empire was the best customer of the United States. Now, American economists hold a common view that restoring the purchasing power of the British Empire is absolutely necessary for American overseas trade. Therefore, the purpose of this loan is undoubtedly to restore the market for American goods in the UK. In the loan agreement, Britain agreed to consider relaxing foreign exchange controls and planned to convene a meeting to abolish tariff barriers, which could also stimulate the development of American overseas trade. At the same time, one of the incidental purposes of the loan is to encourage Britain to repay its ten billion debt within the Empire and to unfreeze the funds that India and Egypt have in London. These countries are rapidly industrializing and are bound to become good customers for American goods. This is the economic reason why the United States is willing to lend. As for politics, the intentions of the Washington authorities are very far-reaching. To put it bluntly, they are afraid of closer ties between Britain and the Soviet Union, which would leave the United States isolated. This possibility seems to be a groundless worry in the current situation, but historians tell us that after 1918, Britain and France led Europe, at least economically, in opposition to the United States. In fact, before 1945, Britain used various methods to promote friendship between Britain and the Soviet Union. Powerful people in Britain openly stated that, given the extent of the destruction the Soviet Union suffered during the war, it would inevitably purchase large quantities of machinery and railway materials after the war. Within half a century, the Soviet Union would be a good customer for Britain. At the same time, the grain, timber, and fur produced by the Soviet Union are also needed by the British Isles. Although there have been many conflicts between Britain and the Soviet Union in the past year, London has never given up its efforts to promote understanding, really leaving room for an unknowable future everywhere. Therefore, if the loan to the United States cannot be successful, pragmatic Britain will approach pragmatic Soviet Union to solve practical difficulties. This is a situation that the United States absolutely does not want to create. House Speaker Rayburn said: "If we do not form an alliance with democratic Britain, I am afraid that someone will unite with Britain. At that time, heaven knows that we will have no allies on the other side of the Atlantic!" These words represent the views and worries of most Americans.</p>
<p>Impact After the Loan is Successful</p>
<p>The impact of the Anglo-American loan's success on the world situation is obvious. That is, Britain's foreign policy will be more in line with the United States in the future, and its attitude towards the Soviet Union will become more firm. The effort to win over Western and Northern European countries will become more active. "The division of the world" now seems to be forming into a settled situation. Domestically, Britain will make comprehensive economic efforts, and its enthusiasm will be no less active than the tension and enthusiasm of wartime production. As evidenced by the fact that just after the US House of Representatives passed the loan bill, Britain announced an order for machinery worth 100 million US dollars. At the same time, the socialization plan will be actively carried out to enhance Britain's economic strength. More leaders in the industry will enter politics to lead Britain through this severe economic crisis. In addition, the success of the loan has another good impact: Britain will have to gradually relax its control over its colonies in the future, at least economically, in order to gain the friendship and sympathy of the United States. At the same time, the inflow of American capital and commodities into various parts of the British Empire will also accelerate the arrival of the era of self-government in these regions.</p>
<p>For the United States, the passage of the loan bill is also a major success. This vibrant and emerging great power is promoting its world policy with military and economic tools. The military tools are the world's unparalleled navy and air force, the destructive atomic bomb, and strategically located world bases; these tools in the hands of the United States do have a stabilizing effect on the world. The economic tool is international loans, assisting the stability and recovery of various countries. The late President Roosevelt of the United States has always advocated abandoning economic isolationism, believing that only when the world is prosperous can the prosperity of the United States last; and only when the world is universally prosperous can lasting peace be guaranteed. This policy is being actively promoted by the Washington authorities. At the same time, it is not difficult to see that the United States is also using loans as a tool of diplomacy, thereby striving for the friendship of various countries. The most obvious recent example is that the Soviet Union wanted the French Communist Party to win the election and supplied France with a batch of grain, and the White House immediately agreed to lend France 1.3 billion US dollars to express American friendship and concern. Poor and backward countries like Abyssinia have also obtained a loan; Poland, which is under the control of the Soviet Union, is also on the list of loans. Only China, the leading country in Asia, still has a 500 million US dollar loan that is elusive and has not yet produced concrete results, which is the most distressing. In summary, under the current world economic policy of the United States, any unified and stable country has the best opportunity for reconstruction and construction; for our country, only by quickly stabilizing internally and completing unification can we avoid disappointing this golden opportunity. Otherwise, I am afraid that the international confrontation will become more and more obvious. One day, the United States will help Japan's recovery, and China's eight years of sacrifice in the Anti-Japanese War will have no price at all!</p>

<h3>July on Miami Beach</h3>
<p>The only gambling venues allowed by law are racetracks. On the first day of the race, bets reached US$1,249,864. However, the madness of gambling is equally romantic in various clubs and hotels. The clubs are surrounded by wire mesh, and machine gunners guard the entrances. Thousands upon thousands of dollars roll around inside.</p>
<p>It is unknown when the craze for Miami Beach's revelry will subside, but a look at the total deposits in the banks cannot help but surprise everyone: US$376,756,194.49! This amount was brought by pot-bellied tycoons, who plan to spend it on this lavish enjoyment.</p>
<p>The statistics are indeed frightening. All 32,849 hotel rooms in the Greater Miami area are fully occupied, and all approximately 81,931 rooms in the 2,886 apartments have been rented to men and women tourists with full purses from all directions. The parking lots are packed. If you want to temporarily rent a place in someone's home, it costs US$35 per week, and you have to say a lot of thankful words.</p>
<p>Some of the more beautiful big companies, such as those along Lincoln Street on Miami Beach, often complain about this: their jewelry, leather goods, and fashions are often bought up by customers. But there is one thing to be comforted about: they have already done US$30 million worth of business in a month. (Jun Mo, July 15)</p>
<h3>Governor of Hong Kong to Visit Guangzhou to Discuss Direct Train Service Between Kowloon and Hankou with Guangdong Authorities</h3>
<p>— Hong Kong Air Mail Dispatch on the 22nd of This Month, Special Correspondent Lin Youlan</p>
<p>Governor of Hong Kong, Yang Muqi</p>
<p>After the typhoon passed, Hong Kong, thanks to heaven's favor, suffered no major losses and quickly returned to normal. The Governor of Hong Kong, Yang Muqi, in order to strengthen Sino-British relations, is scheduled to go to the province on the 28th of this month to pay an official visit to our military and political authorities. Yang arrived in Hong Kong at the end of April and has been there for three months now, and this is said to be his first visit to the province.</p>
<p>Yang's visit to the province has been rumored before. It was said that it had been hindered at one point due to certain unpleasant Sino-British events (such as the National Daily incident). Now that Yang's visit to the province has a date, the relationship between Guangdong and Hong Kong may receive further understanding. According to informed sources close to the Hong Kong government, the most important matter for Yang to discuss with the Guangdong authorities will be the issue of direct train service between Kowloon and Hankou. Du Lihua, Director of the British Section of the Kowloon-Canton Railway, personally led several technicians to visit and inspect the Changsha-Hengyang sections on the eve of the official opening of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway on July 1, and had contact with Du Zhenyuan, Director of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Bureau.</p>
<p>Direct train service between Kowloon and Hankou has a great impact on the Hong Kong business community. European and American goods transshipped from Kowloon will pour into the Central China area via the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, competing with foreign goods imported from Shanghai. However, it has already been recognized by those in the know that Kowloon's imported goods enter Central China directly without transshipment through Guangzhou, which benefits Hong Kong and harms Guangzhou. The connection and joint operation of the Guangdong-Hankou and Kowloon-Canton Railways were discussed long before the war. At that time, our side specially built a Huangpu branch line in the suburbs of Guangzhou, intending to make Huangpu the terminal station of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, replacing the position of Kowloon. This once attracted great attention from the Hong Kong government. After the war, there were rumors that the US would help us restore the opening of Huangpu Port, but it quickly subsided. Hong Kong recently requested direct train service between Kowloon and Hankou twice a month, but this has not yet become a reality. How this issue will be resolved in the end is now the focus of attention of the Hong Kong, Guangdong, Chinese and foreign business communities.</p>
<p>In the three months since Yang arrived in Hong Kong, he has made many achievements in restoring civil administration, including: (1) Promoting Hong Kong's autonomous political system; (2) Maintaining rice rationing, announcing a declaration of war on the black market, and resolving to eliminate those who disrupt price controls; (3) Settling strike waves; (4) Regularly restoring preferential tariffs for Hong Kong goods exported to British territories; (5) Implementing cloth control; (6) Establishing a Construction and Restoration Office to repair damaged houses throughout Hong Kong, opening the Peak residential area, and no longer prohibiting Chinese residents; (7) Rectifying the city appearance, arresting hawkers and prostitutes, etc.</p>

<p>Thoughts After Visiting the Bund Park</p>
<p>Dear Editor: The Bund Park is a great place for recreation and cooling off. Every summer, it is crowded with tourists. Before the war, the various facilities were still passable. During the enemy and puppet period, the environment changed, and tourists hesitated. Now that the sun is shining again, tourists are as numerous as before. However, the environment has not changed, and the Municipal Government is expected to make improvements: (1) A new gate must be opened. Before the war, there was a gate at the Wai Bai Du Bridge. Today, that gate is still blocked, and only a narrow side gate (in the southeast corner) serves as the main entrance and exit, which is crowded all day long, especially at dusk, and tourists from Hongkou have to walk many detours; (2) The barbed wire must be removed. The barbed wire on the walkways in the park is layered, and the light from the electric lamps is insufficient. If you are not careful, it is easy to tear your clothes and break your hands, especially for children. I once took my child to visit at night, and the child broke his hand and tore his clothes. As a result, we went to the park with interest but returned home disappointed; (3) The time must be extended. The summer days are very long, and it gets dark around 8:30 pm. The average citizen washes up after work, has dinner, and sets off, often arriving at the park at dark, but the park managers shout loudly at 9:50 pm that the time is up and it's time to close, which is a bit disappointing.

<h3>Tiger Stove Should Sell Boiling Water</h3>
<p>It is mid-summer, and the tiger epidemic is rampant. However, disease enters through the mouth. Most Shanghai citizens do not pay attention to hygiene. Modern ladies all take eating cold food as fashionable; the working class all fill their stomachs with unclean food; housewives quench their thirst with tea made from water boiled at tiger stoves. However, when tiger stoves are busy, they tend to serve customers with water that is not boiling, which easily causes illness. I hope that the tiger stove owners will uphold the morality of serving the public, pay attention to public hygiene, and not sell non-boiling water to customers. I also hope that the health authorities will pay attention to this!</p>

<h3>Midsummer Scenery on the Shores of Lake Michigan</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Our Chicago Correspondent Mao Shuqing, Dated 5th</p>
<p>In early summer, Chicago's heat rises to eighty-eight degrees. On the shores of Lake Michigan, hundreds and thousands of men and women, practically naked, lie on the beach. From Jackson Park in the south to the north side of Evanston, this twenty-six-mile stretch of Chicago's lakefront is their "human paradise." The azure waters of the lake reflect the sunlight, and the green willows along the shore sway in the breeze. There are well-maintained and beautiful parks, artificially arranged fountains, wide and flat roads, and summer night music performances. Summer is Chicago's golden season, attracting many wealthy American merchants. They pass through Chicago from New York, Washington, New Orleans, and Miami on their way to Canada for summer retreats. Summer is also Chicago's season of madness, attracting many local young men and women. Born and raised in Chicago, they endure cold winters, windy springs, and rainy autumns. Only the annual summer season brings them joy from the lake water and sweetness and pleasure from the cool breezes of the shore!</p>
<p>(I) Entertainment Center</p>
<p>The world's largest hotel is in Chicago, the world's most industrialized area is in Chicago, and the city with the most parks in the world is also Chicago. A secretary in the municipal government told me that there are a total of ninety-six famous parks in the city. In 1946, the municipal government budgeted $27 million for park management and administration, and this year's education budget is $80 million, with $10 million for fire protection. In the summer, from the Fourth of July Independence Day to Labor Day in September, the municipal government provides free music performances in major parks. Renowned orchestras and opera houses take turns performing every night, and these expenses are all paid by the municipal government. In addition, the municipal government plans to set up more than thirty entertainment centers, distributed near high schools throughout the city. During the school year, these centers are partially enjoyed by the middle schools, and on school holidays, they are open to the public. These "entertainment centers" include sports and parks, and it is said that the cost of these centers is considerable.</p>
<p>Chicago is the second largest city in the United States. In reality, Chicago's municipal scale is even larger than New York's. In terms of area, Chicago stretches twenty-six miles from north to south and perhaps one mile from east to west, making it larger than New York's "Manhattan" and slightly smaller than "Greater New York City." In terms of the complexity of its population, Chicago has more Polish, Italian, and Japanese people than New York. In Chicago, foreign immigrants of different nationalities often live together in groups. They still speak their own dialects and read their own small newspapers. It is said that this is what the American authorities find most "headache-inducing." The small tribal-style residential system hinders their integration and reduces their sense of belonging to America. To put it more bluntly, the small tribal-style residential system is not easily assimilated by the United States. During the war, Japanese residents in Chicago were all transferred to concentration camps in the west. After the war, the American authorities hoped to disperse the Japanese community across the forty-eight states, preventing them from concentrating in one place. However, little by little, they slowly returned to Chicago.</p>
<p>(II) A Complex City</p>
<p>On the streets of Chicago, I simply couldn't tell if someone approaching me was Japanese or one of my own compatriots. With yellow skin and black hair, especially the Japanese girls, who looked as delicate and pretty as Chinese ladies. One day, I was buying something in a grocery store, and another American customer asked me if I was Japanese. I told him I was Chinese. The store owner scolded the customer for being "ignorant" and "rash." The customer was not convinced, and they started arguing. In the end, I had to mediate to resolve the matter. The store owner said that Chicago has more Japanese people than any other place because Chicagoans are too "polite" to the Japanese. However, the store owner himself said: "I can't stand the Japanese because I fought against them in the Philippines!"</p>
<p>Black people account for one-tenth of the 3.5 million citizens. Black people also live in ethnic enclaves, mostly on the west side, along the lake, from 57th Street to 59th Street. The streets and grounds are full of black people, and therefore the area is relatively dirty. In the western suburbs, there are many small villages that are entirely owned by black people. They each have a small house, a small garden, and a Ford car. Their circumstances in America may have tragic elements, but their material lives are touched by the light of paradise.</p>
<p>Chicago is a complex city. From Lake Shore Drive to the neon-lit "State Street" and then west to Maxwell Street Market, you can travel through several centuries. Maxwell Street is like Shanghai's Chenghuang Miao, Suzhou's Xuanmiao Guan, and Nanjing's Fuzi Miao, but even dirtier and noisier than those places by ten thousand times. Originally, the moon, bedbugs, Eastern and Western cultures each have their advantages and disadvantages. We've seen them, so let it be.</p>
<p>The more complex the society, the more difficult the governance. Chicago has a mayor known as a "strong-arm politician" named Kelly. Chicagoans have a special term for their municipal government that outsiders cannot understand: the "Kelly-Nash machine." This machine is the ruler of Chicago and the source of all power in Chicago society. Nash was earlier than Kelly. It should really be called the "Nash-Kelly machine." But because the old name was used habitually, it has been retained. A joke circulating in Chicago says: When the last exposition was held, industrial and commercial products from all over were shipped to Chicago for exhibition. An old lady from the countryside also came to visit. After finishing her visit, the organizers asked her what she thought. She kept shaking her head. The organizers asked, "Old lady, what are you dissatisfied with?" She said: "I saw all kinds of machines, but why did you leave out the most famous Kelly-Nash machine?"</p>
<p>(III) Strong-Arm Mayor</p>
<p>You can imagine how powerful this strong-arm mayor's "strong arm" is! He is one of the big shots in the Democratic Party. Americans usually call him the boss of the Democratic Party. As long as Democrats hear "Kelly," even the most powerful among them seem to have to give him some "face." It is said that the current Secretary-General of the Democratic Party, the current Postmaster General Hannegan, was promoted by Kelly himself. In 1944, the Democratic National Convention was held in Chicago. Vice President Wallace was defeated, and Truman took office. This whole process was also the result of Kelly's control. I cannot verify whether this story is accurate, but Chicagoans deeply believe that their mayor has such great "magic."</p>
<p>I did not meet Mayor Kelly. A secretary from the municipal government guided me to visit the Municipal Museum and the Lakeside Observatory. The observatory is a fake model. Inside, it is dark. When the lights are turned on, you can see the movement of the celestial bodies, how the planets rotate, how the satellites orbit, and it is as realistic as the real thing. It is shown twice a day in the morning and afternoon, and three times on Sundays. Many children visit, accompanied by their parents to increase their knowledge. One of the administrators asked me: "I heard that there is a madman in China who invented the ninth planet?" The people watching laughed until they couldn't close their mouths.</p>
<p>The secretary from the municipal government told me many trivial stories about Chicago, and also told me many true stories about Madame Chiang's popular visit to the United States. He showed me the "Drake" Hotel on the Gold Coast, saying that it was where Madame Chiang stayed.</p>
<p>(IV) Gold Coast</p>
<p>The Gold Coast is the best paradise on the shores of Lake Michigan, and the most people swim there in the summer. There is a wooden fence between the road and the beach. Because this area is the most sophisticated in Chicago, it is filled with "offices" of large banks and companies, like the Bund of Shanghai's Nanjing Road, hence the name "Gold." Some say that the reflection of the lake water on the beach looks like gold, hence the name Gold Coast. I don't understand archaeology, so I don't have time to delve into it.</p>
<p>During my twelve days in Chicago, because Vice Counselor Shen Zuogan and Wang Sen both had their own cars, we took a "drive" along the shores of Lake Michigan several times. We drove from the Chicago Bridge all the way to Evanston, and then north to the border between Illinois and Wisconsin. This road is full of lush greenery. On Sundays, there is an endless stream of cars. Americans, regardless of age or gender, use "driving" for leisure and enjoy their youth. Just looking at the rows of cars along the shores of Lake Michigan, I thought there were more and more common than in New York.</p>
<p>Many Americans work in Chicago and settle their families in Evanston. Evanston is a town adjacent to Chicago. The famous Northwestern University is located on the lakeside in Evanston. There are only five Chinese students studying at Northwestern University. When they walk in town, American men, women, and children all recognize them. A police academy student named Zhao, recently graduated from the Northwestern University Police Training Program. He participated in their practical traffic control practice and was praised by the school authorities.</p>
<p>(V) Great Lakes Plain</p>
<p>I did not enter the state of Wisconsin. In northern Illinois, I visited many lovely small cities. This area is the "Great Lakes Plain" of the United States, like China's Dongting Lake Plain and Taihu Lake Plain. It is endless, all fertile land. In early summer, the red harvesters in the countryside have already started working. I visited several farm families. They said that they harvest their wheat three or four times a year. They use only machines for their farming. They are a "large-scale farm system." One farm family can manage the equivalent of more than 100 mu of land in China. Although in the countryside, they still have electricity, telephones, running water, radios, and sanitary facilities.</p>
<p>The fields by the lake are fertile. Their shore is only two feet above the water level of Lake Michigan. However, they have never had a flood. An American in Chicago who knows China well said: If Chicago is like Hankou, then the biggest difference between the two cities is that one has floods and the other never will. I told him that China is launching a nationwide campaign to build water conservancy projects. Once the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River is completed, wouldn't Hankou be like Chicago? He applauded!</p>
<p>Water conservancy has created fertile fields, and fertile fields plus industry have created the prosperity of Chicago and the prosperity of the United States. This world metropolis with the most smokestacks was still a primitive wilderness of red Indians before the mid-19th century. In 1833, the Americans defeated the red Indians and crossed Lake Michigan to arrive in Chicago.</p>
<p>Chicago's growth was not accidental. Historically, many great heroes contributed to the creation of Chicago. William B. Ogden was the first to build a railway for Chicago. Cyrus McCormick, the founder of McCormick Harvesting Machine Company, laid the foundation for the agricultural industrialization of the American Midwest. During the Civil War, Lincoln's support base was Chicago. Lincoln's Secretary of War said: "If McCormick's Harvesting Machine Company had not changed the agricultural system, then President Lincoln would not have won." Today, any American, east, west, north, or south, recognizes these words as truth.</p>
<p>(VI) Industrial and Commercial Authority</p>
<p>The world's two largest slaughterhouses, Armour and Swift, are both in Chicago. Armour was founded during the Civil War. During the Civil War, the American army already had an endless supply of canned food. Armour's slaughterhouse manufactured it and unconditionally supplied it to President Lincoln's Northern Army, defeating the Southern Confederate Army. After President Lincoln was assassinated, Pullman, a train merchant in Chicago, specially made "Pullman-style" sleeping cars to carry Lincoln's body back to Springfield. Later, "Pullman" became the specialized name for sleeping cars and the patented merchant for sleeping cars. To this day, all sleeping cars in the United States are called "Pullman." Pullman's car factory is also located in Chicago.</p>
<p>Chicago facilitated the victory of the Civil War, and the Civil War also brought Chicago an unshakable prosperity. During the Civil War, Chicago relied on its convenient lakeside transportation, absorbing the mineral deposits of Minnesota to the north and combining them with the coal of Pennsylvania to the east, stabilizing Chicago's industry. Therefore, to this day, Chicago's factories are still mostly located by the lake.</p>
<p>Today's Chicago landlord, Palmer, bought up land around State Street during the Civil War. Chicago's famous businessman, Marshall Field (owner of the New York Evening Post and the Chicago Sun), his predecessors established Chicago's commercial authority during the Civil War. The Chicago gangs and "circles" of "White Xiangren," the so-called "Capone"-led Chicago orthodoxy, also brewed from the Civil War era. Only eighty years have passed since the Civil War, and in those eighty years, this fertile land on the shores of Lake Michigan has been transformed into a world metropolis of industrial authority.</p>

<h3>Answering Readers' Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(I) Qian Qi has instructed the Social Services section of your newspaper to show the way and seek happiness for the public, which is deeply admired! I also have several questions: (1) My late father had five sons, A, B, C, D, and E. B died early, D was adopted by another family, and E was born to my stepmother. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, he set up a grocery store, which was destroyed by fire. He was also burdened by his children, so he lacked funds to build a house. Later, A rebuilt it alone and rented it out, with A receiving the rent. When my father passed away in 1924, A, who was sinister, demanded that a will be made on the spot. B was unwilling to sign, and D was underage and signed by his mother as guardian. Is this will valid? Are there any legal remedies? (2) The rights to the house were enjoyed until the July 7th Incident. B fled and, after returning, lived there unconditionally. To this day, the land is jointly owned, but the house was built by A. The so-called "private building on borrowed land" has been enjoyed for more than twenty years. Can the house be jointly owned or does it belong to A? (3) E's mother is still alive. Does her inheritance right still exist or has it disappeared? (4) B has no children, A now only has one son, and E has two sons. Can A's son inherit in the future?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia's Answer] (1) A will becomes effective upon the death of the testator if it is legal. If it is not legal, the court can be requested to confirm that the will is invalid. However, the statute of limitations for this case has expired. Unless the period for exercising the right could not be observed due to the war, the right can still be exercised according to the law. Otherwise, there is no legal procedure for remedy. (2) If there is no other contract, then it should belong to the land. (3) The statute of limitations has expired. (4) No, because there is no ancestral inheritance in current law.</p>
<p>(II) Zhang Mengyun asked: After her uncle passed away last month, a dispute arose between her aunt and her children over the inheritance. Because her aunt was a second wife and the wedding was not held, she gave birth to a daughter, who is already twenty years old. Her son was adopted out. In this situation, how should the inheritance be distributed fairly?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia's Answer] If the mother did not marry the father, she does not acquire the status of spouse. If the son is "adopted out," he does not take the deceased's surname and has no status as an adopted son. The daughter is the biological child and was raised by the father, so the inheritance should be inherited by the daughter.</p>
<p>(III) Sun Wocheng asked: In 1942, I rented a back room on the upper floor of a building in this city. There was no lease at the time, and we have been living in peace ever since. Recently, the third landlord (I am a fourth tenant) suddenly used the excuse of wanting to take it back for personal use and asked me to move out. I replied that the housing shortage is so serious now, where can I find a place? Some also want gold bars, etc. According to neighbors, they plan to deal with me by improper means. I am here to ask, if there are improper means, can I appeal to the law? Is there a right to continue the lease in law? Please answer publicly in your newspaper.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia's Answer] (1) If you are treated with improper means, you can appeal to the law; (2) Before the lease is legally terminated, you have the right to continue to live in the lease.</p>
<h3>Where Can Small Loans Be Obtained?</h3>

<h3>Havana! We Will Never Forget You</h3>
<p>— Written by Qiu Ping from Pearl Harbor on the 9th</p>
<p>The fleet arrived in Havana, the capital of Cuba, on the morning of the 11th.</p>
<p>Havana is the jewel of Central and South America, with magnificent architecture and a warm climate. Hollywood often comes to Havana to shoot colorful films depicting the South American scenery. About 20,000 overseas Chinese live here and have a district. During Cuba's independence revolution, they stood shoulder to shoulder with the people and defended the city walls, shedding their blood and making a significant contribution. Therefore, Cuban historians have written in praise of the overseas Chinese: "No Chinese was a traitor, and no Chinese was a coward." However, they still face the same discrimination and oppression as overseas Chinese in other places. Although the motherland has stood up in suffering and amidst the flames of war, the overseas Chinese living far away are still living the same lives they have lived for decades. Although the motherland has been listed as one of the four great powers, "victory" overseas is just a name in the newspapers.</p>
<p>Since Minister Li Dijun was sent to Cuba and signed a treaty of friendship with the Cuban government, the overseas Chinese in Cuba have finally breathed a sigh of relief. However, they are still subject to depressed wages. Today, being able to see the motherland's navy, raising the flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth, sailing from the Atlantic Ocean into the port of the Cuban capital, is a true liberation in spirit.</p>
<h3>Chinese Fleet: Everyone Eager to See It First</h3>
<p>The fleet docked amidst fervent cheers, with crowds packing the pier until it was impassable. "Chinese Fleet" had been a frequently used headline in newspapers for months and a fashionable term in people's conversations. People craned their necks, eager to catch a glimpse first.</p>
<p>The naval officers went ashore and took streetcars to the Chinese district. An amiable journalist accompanied us in visiting the Kuomintang, the Chee Kung Tong, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, and the consulate, receiving courteous and enthusiastic welcomes. Each place prepared abundant refreshments and cold drinks to entertain. "I didn't come here to make you spend money; I came to shake hands with you." I felt deeply grateful and ashamed, but I didn't say it out loud.</p>
<p>At a Kuomintang elementary school, we met a young teacher who enthusiastically told us about the situation of the overseas Chinese, mentioning the decline and seriousness of overseas children's education. There are about ten thousand overseas Chinese children in Harbin, yet there is only one elementary school with about sixty students.</p>

<h3>Salute!</h3>
<p>— Pingzhai</p>
<p>After eight years of arduous and determined resistance, victorious China has gained liberation and rebirth. At the beginning of this new era, we are delighted to see our own fleet, the new navy of new China.</p>
<p>This fleet arrived at Wusong on the 19th of this month, including two escort destroyers and six minesweepers, such as Yong Sheng, Yong Bao, and Yong Ning, originally owned by the U.S. Navy, and gifted to China by the U.S. government after the war. From now on, the Pacific Ocean will have a new look. From now on, millions of overseas Chinese compatriots who care about the motherland will see warships flying the Chinese naval flag overseas.</p>
<p>Our coastline is so long - without a navy, there is no way to talk about national defense. For thousands of years, the coastal provinces have always been exposed, and as a result, these richest provinces have frequently suffered foreign threats, and the country and the nation have had to endure many humiliations in order to compromise. Today, when we wash away this long-standing shame, we should indeed make plans to remedy it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Of course, in terms of quantity, this fleet is still far from meeting the actual needs, but in any case, this is a good start. The friendship of the Allied nations is indeed appreciable, but the main thing is still to rely on ourselves. It seems that we should be vigilant, and we should not underestimate ourselves. Why can't we replace Japan's position in the Pacific Ocean back then?</p>
<p>We want to defend ourselves. We need weapons for self-defense. We must make this good start flourish and become the most powerful and stable force on the west coast of the Pacific!</p>

<h3>Delicacy and Richness</h3>
<p>— Moyu</p>
<p>Most Chinese people have a very subtle and traditional view of calligraphy: that is, like the illusions woven by the "Book of Changes," they use brushstrokes to understand the writer's virtues and experiences; but its role is at most only to "understand." If we want to further clearly understand a person's character, demeanor, and how they deal with life, I think it's better to study what each person has carved with their brushstrokes in the process of life.</p>
<p>If a person does not slightly change his basic desires for life and even career due to origin, environment, and other objective reasons, his work may permanently maintain an unusually rich side. Conversely, his work will inevitably tend to be detached and erratic, that is, completely overwhelmed by the atmosphere of delicacy.</p>
<p>Genius does not necessarily express richness, because this also depends on the author's own choices in the process of life. Zhao Mengfu's calligraphy and painting are both things that make us unable to deny his genius, but between his every dot and stroke, there is no lament of a remnant subject, no somber and severe lines, and no unrestrained and flowing, weeping brushstrokes; this is the opposite of how we feel when we look at Bada Shanren's paintings. He left the court and the country, wandering around, these hardships and sufferings needed a place to pour out, so the picture constituted bloodstains and tears beyond the artistic conception. These marks are all the persistence of his life in his personality; his life path was suffocated, but there was still a glimmer of hope, and the expression of this hope in art often surpasses the achievements of genius. Zheng Xiaoxu and Wang Zhaoming certainly completed elegant and craggy shapes in their genius, but their later political life is evidence that this shape is only limited to delicacy. Like Zhao Mengfu, genius overflowed from the bottom of their lives, and the dregs of profit and opportunism filled the original gaps, and as a result, we will never see their pure, steady, and solid rich style.</p>
<p>A writer with a delicate style is often respectful and rebellious,拘泥 and indulgent; their hearts are always calculating how to control and use what will at least not be harmful to their reality, so they will not have big setbacks, but they will also not have the highest success, the most honorable and ideal success. This is the case with Zeng Guofan: he devoted his life to cultivating his character, neither erring nor being lazy, desperately planning his own view of life, and trying his best to suppress the accidental provocations of the environment; but he still wanted to rebel and indulge. We don't have to read his family letters and collections. Just thinking of his two sentences, "Don't remove the courtyard grass to leave life, love to raise pot fish to know the chemical machine," we can understand that he originally took the pursuit of life and chemical machine as the lofty goal beyond his career, but the result was limited by his delicate accomplishment and eventually submerged. This is what we think is very regrettable.</p>
<p>Shi Dakai, who failed in Zeng Guofan's hands, was a grassroots hero with infinite richness; his utterance "A great thief also has a way, poetry and books are not contemptible, gold is like dirt, liver and gallbladder are indeed like iron, ride a horse across a cliff, bend a bow and shoot at the bright moon, make a human head into a wine cup, drink all the blood of hatred" fully shows his human nature's flying, the surge of enthusiasm, and the unadorned cry against the corrupt society of the time; Later, he wrote "Entrusted to the tiger's mouth, carefully planning work, hate the thieves who do not know heroes, casually tie iron chains to flying swans, when will they grow wings, and travel ten thousand miles in the long wind; ... The six tactics and three strategies are all empty, and I want to ask the heavens about my great ambition, my brother can't go, tears spill red azaleas." It shows the revolutionary's determination not to condone failure. He sublimated his ideals from despair and did not let them be tainted with the many decadent and declining atmospheres after failure; in this way, although he failed, it did not hinder the original quality of his life; although he had the tragic cry of a hero at the end of his road, it was enough to add a layer of precious richness to his works.</p>
<p>There are also people who make success and failure and weaving richness form cause and effect in their lives: several orthodox scholars like Han Yu and his ilk, due to failure in their careers, became ingenious, and at the same time, because of their ingenuity, they were always unable to hold their heads high in their careers: this is entirely because they have too much restraint and affectation. Cao Mengde exchanged richness for success, and then used success to vividly express his rich personality; the former reminds us of his bold words "I would rather I betray others than others betray me"; the latter seems to make us forever remember his "For example, morning dew, there are not many days left? ...慨當以慷, it's hard to forget the sorrow". The inside shows the mind; he has ambition, has insights, does not avoid labor and resentment, does not resign from hardship, and immerses himself in a rich atmosphere throughout his life to obtain the greatest joy of life.</p>
<p>I have been looking forward to the rebirth of works such as Gorky, Gogol, and Lu Xun, because the world is really too barren and hypocritical; we now need to use rich wisdom to cleanse our minds, because only richness can have true joy, lovely anger, deep sorrow, and sublime joy. Only richness can make us understand life more clearly and sensitively hear the breath of this era. Delicacy cannot do these things; it can only make us degenerate and confused.</p>
<h3>Old Man (Fiction)</h3>
<p>— Xie Beicheng</p>
<p>As soon as the weather got hot, the old man took off his bare back, picked a shady wall to sit down, and held a banana fan in his hand, for cooling and for driving away flies.</p>
<p>But in this dull and humid summer, he really felt too tired, and he just wanted to doze off in bursts. He didn't know where all the strength he had when he was young had gone. He gradually closed his eyes, and suddenly a swarm of flies swirled around his head. All of a sudden, it was close to his scalp, and then it flew away again. The old man slightly opened his tired eyes, and violently fanned his fan a few times:</p>
<p>He was a little more awake, and tried hard to open his eyes. He saw piles of old sesame seeds spread out on the grass mat in the sun in front of him. He suddenly remembered his task. His daughter-in-law had sent her to guard these things. He seemed to see his daughter-in-law standing in front of him with her eyebrows raised firmly, so he pretended to be fine and vigorously waved the fan, as if he had never dozed off.</p>
<p>But these eyes really didn't give face, and desperately wanted to fall down. He used all his strength to hold on to them, but he couldn't hold on. He was covered in sweat before he could look around!</p>
<p>There was no one around, only the straight sun shining down, only the cicadas on the trees desperately hissing:</p>
<p>Hiss...</p>
<p>So he stopped trying and let his eyes sink down at will, letting a pleasant, shady darkness cover them.</p>
<p>The shadows under the wall moved slowly, and no one cared; a comfortable stream of saliva dripped from the old man's mouth, and no one cared.</p>
<p>So the pile of old, even rotting grain spread out there was even more uncared for. Occasionally, one or two small birds braved the summer heat to pass by, landed, slowly ate their fill, and then flew away on their own, even more uncared for, as if the world was born so generous, everything was so leisurely and indifferent, just like those foreign Sinologists and Chinese Foreign Sinologists praised.</p>
<p>In fact, the world is not so generous, and it has not been so generous for a long time. Of course, it may have been in the past, because everyone is still yearning for the past life, when they could eat their fill, and a bag of white flour sold for two foreign coins... When they didn't have money, they could run to the door of the grain store and shout:</p>
<p>"Shopkeeper, give me a bag of flour on credit!"</p>
<p>After a while, the grain store clerk would carry the flour over. The old people of the ancient city lived such a generous life!</p>
<p>It's not like that now. The grain store owner shakes his head when he sees anyone:</p>
<p>"White flour? You must be dreaming! Now there's no corn flour to sell!"</p>
<p>The big pineapple outside the grain store door was upside down, basking in the sun and making a rattling sound, even more ugly than a starving beggar.</p>
<p>So people who have a little money in their hands try their best to exchange them for a little bit of pitiful food, whether it's white flour, sorghum rice, corn flour, bean flour, or even bean cake, all kinds of old grain that are stale, moldy, and bitter, as long as someone is willing to sell it and ask for a price, someone will buy it and carefully store it away.</p>
<p>The days when white flour cost two yuan a bag are long gone, and you can't chase it back no matter how hard you try.</p>
<p>The old man's family is naturally no exception. A family of three generations and five mouths, that mouth has to be filled:</p>
<p>In this world now, how difficult it is to fill your stomach! The Chinese people in the ancient city are no longer so leisurely and generous.</p>
<p>The old man's family is not rich, but they have not starved to death. His son works hard outside, his daughter-in-law also goes out to "sell her face," his grandson is still young, and he still runs out in the hot weather, carrying a box of ten pounds of ice on his back, shouting all over the street:</p>
<p>"Ice cores relieve heat, ice cores relieve heat..."</p>
<p>No matter how the sweat flows, the ice cubes in that box are for others to eat. In the evening? He also runs around sweating and shouting:</p>
<p>"Evening news, evening news, read the evening news..."</p>
<p>Only the old man, old, when he was young, he carried five bags of rice alone, and once he carried three big bags of smuggled salt and jumped off the city wall. He was a well-known figure, but what's the use? He is old, and the strength he had when he was young has been given to young people again. When the weather is hot, he can only lean against the shady wall and let his life slowly wear away.</p>
<p>Whenever the sun is fierce, the daughter-in-law thinks of the old man, also because the grains are too humid and too old. She spreads these things on the grass mat in the sun, hoping to dry off some of the damp and moldy smell, and then greets the old man:</p>
<p>"Watch out, Dad!"</p>
<p>Then she rushes out to find her life again.</p>
<p>That time, the old man couldn't help but sigh:</p>
<p>"I'm old, and they still won't let me off, a little bit of old grain and rotten sesame seeds... When I was young, I used to buy one meal at a time..."</p>
<p>But he had to hold back his stubbornness:</p>
<p>"I'm old, this is when I'm begging for food from my son!"</p>
<p>What can be done?</p>
<p>So he had to patiently guard this grain that tortured him, which was coarse and bitter.</p>
<p>But the world is too lonely, no one, no wind, only a few cicadas, hissing hoarsely:</p>
<p>"Hiss..."</p>
<p>Everything is too monotonous, too depressing, too lonely, just tempting people to close their eyes and let life escape in the quietness of darkness.</p>
<p>The old man closed his eyes and forgot everything in front of him. The strength of twenty years ago returned to his body, the slack muscles were filled again, the wrinkled skin was filled, his eyes were glowing, and he stood out from the darkness like a calf:</p>
<p>He re-practiced the heroic life twenty years ago:</p>
<p>He opened his eyes and saw the outside of the densely shaded farmhouse, the weather in the early autumn countryside, just after a good rain, and now the sky was clear; the sunset glow smeared the horizon, removing the dryness of the autumn tiger, and a new cool air covered it.</p>
<p>Everyone was holding a banana fan, but they didn't fan it, just because they were used to it, and they couldn't remember to throw it away even when the weather was cool.</p>
<p>The old man was the first to rush outside the grass wall and shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"How cool!"</p>
<p>The loud voice followed the branches of the dense forest and spread to the fields behind. The partners also crowded out:</p>
<p>"How cool, we have to have two cups in this weather:"</p>
<p>The old man laughed happily:</p>
<p>"I'll tell them to kill two chickens later, and we'll have a good time drinking!"</p>
<p>This is a life that is too familiar, as if he had experienced such a life somewhere, but now he can't find it. He carefully searched for it, letting the cool early autumn wind blow on his face.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a rustling sound, and a black shadow rushed out of the tree group, scaring everyone:</p>
<p>A man rushed over panting, his face red, panting like an air pump, rushing out his words with a light and heavy tone!</p>
<p>"Old, old, old, boss... that side, that side, that... pack of salt... let the running dogs... gnaw, gnaw, gnaw, gnaw... held..."</p>
<p>The old man was the first to jump up,</p>
<p>"Grandma, Grandma's x..."</p>
<p>He rushed into the grass wall, grabbed a white wax stick and walked out:</p>
<p>"Go, beat his grandma's x..."</p>
<p>As if he was riding on clouds and driving fog, he didn't know how he ran to the bottom of a mountain, and he didn't know how he used the white wax pole to beat back others, but finally everyone carried three big packs on their backs and ran back with big strides.</p>
<p>This section was very vague, but in the old man's memory, he had been pursuing it every day. He had boasted to his son about this heroic experience, but unexpectedly, he lightly returned to the lost glory.</p>
<p>He was very happy and threw three packs of salt into the grass hall with all his might:</p>
<p>"Grandma, smuggling a handful of private salt is just a bird, I carried it back with my strength:"</p>
<p>Then he clapped his hands:</p>
<p>"Kill ten chickens from his grandma, one for each person, and everyone will have a good time drinking!"</p>
<p>So the courtyard surrounded by the grass wall was full of:</p>
<p>"Cluck, cluck, cluck..."</p>
<p>The chickens fluttered their wings and ran all over the yard!</p>
<p>It still "clucked" when held in hand, and it still "clucked" when put in a pot of hot soup.</p>
<p>Everyone was happy, happily surrounding the pot of hot soup, watching the chickens fluttering their wings and calling in the hot soup, calling, calling, calling, it's not good!</p>
<p>It's not good, the hot soup pot collapsed with a bang, the chickens were on fire, running around the house, fanning around the yard, there was fire everywhere, it was very hot, sweating.</p>
<p>In the chaos, I don't know who slapped the old man heavily on the face:</p>
<p>"This old, immortal thing!..."</p>
<p>His body shook unsteadily, a burst of dazzling golden light flashed before his eyes, the heat all around squeezed up, and a shadow of birds fluttered their wings and flew past on his head:</p>
<p>"Alas alas alas..."</p>
<p>I often heard my daughter-in-law shouting loudly</p>
<p>"Drink, go—drink, go—"</p>
<p>"This old, immortal thing..."</p>
<p>The old man touched his arms, they were withered, the flesh was lost, the skin was wrinkled, and he returned to that weak old age. The glory of his early years was a shadow, flashing only in front of him. He tried hard to open his eyes, and gradually he saw that the grains spread out in front of him were scattered and thin, and three or five crows were desperately pecking at them.</p>
<p>His daughter-in-law, with a red face and sweat dripping, was attentively shouting and scolding:</p>
<p>"Drink—go, drink—go..."</p>
<p>"This old, immortal thing..."</p>
<p>This angry scolding stung the old man's heart like a needle. He lowered his head in shame and closed his eyes:</p>
<p>"Alas, I'm old!"</p>
<p>The shade had moved away from his head, and the scorching sun was shining on his scalp. He forgot everything, and let the fan fall on the ground!</p>
<p>His daughter-in-law was still waving her hands and shouting:</p>
<p>"Drink—go, drink—go..."</p>
<p>Suddenly, a crow fluttered its wings and flew past his head, and the tip of its wing slashed across the old man's face, and he was slapped hard.</p>
<p>The old man's hand subconsciously covered his face, and a burst of annoyance surged in his heart. The depletion of energy in his old age made him lose the patience to endure the youthful vitality, he suddenly opened his eyes and jumped up!</p>
<p>"A little bit of old grains, rotten sesame seeds, you!..."</p>
<p>Before he finished speaking, he looked up and saw his son standing in front of him with his head down, saying in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Dad, the crows have eaten all the grain!"</p>
<p>The old man didn't have the courage to make eye contact with his son. He secretly moved his gaze to the empty space where the grain had been:</p>
<p>His daughter-in-law was no longer chasing away the crows. She wiped away her tears with a dirty handkerchief, and held a broom in her other hand, gently sweeping together the remaining grains on the ground.</p>
<p>Outside the street, a child with a dry throat shouted:</p>
<p>"Ice cores relieve heat, ice cores relieve heat..."</p>
<p>The sun was still shining straight down, but it was getting a little west.</p>
<p>The old man lowered his head in shame and sighed:</p>
<p>"I'm old, I'm old, alas!"</p>
<p>Two drops of tears dripped from his dimmed old eyes, fell on the ground, and seeped down.</p>

<h3>Painting and Religion</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>Religion is the source of art. There is no art that does not have a close relationship with religion. Religion is inherently an ethereal and elusive thing, mysterious and intangible. In order to make people believe, it is necessary to rely on art with tangible form and color, using concrete, material things to evoke people's imagination of abstract spirit. Therefore, all religions build magnificent and grand temples. For example, Greek temples, Christian churches, Islamic mosques, Buddhist temples, Taoist monasteries, as well as national ancestral temples and shrines, and private ancestral halls, all occupy a very important and lofty position in architecture, surpassing even the imperial palaces of past dynasties. As for sculpture, people in prehistoric times had already used stone, bone, wood, and other materials to carve idols for worship. Greek sculpture is unparalleled throughout the ages. The main stone statues it carved are mostly gods in mythology. The statues in Christian churches are filled with Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and figures from the Bible. Buddhism especially values statues. Not to mention India, but in China alone, the statues of Longmen Grottoes still exist today, and the statues of Yungang Grottoes are simply unprecedented. In addition, dance originated from sacrifices to gods, music originated from honoring gods, poetry was for praising gods, and drama was for entertaining gods. As the mainstream of art, painting naturally formed an inextricable bond with religion.</p>
<p>When painting was exploited by politicians and had not yet been liberated, it was truly a double misfortune, yet it was also captured by religious figures. In the Middle Ages in the West, almost no painting was unrelated to Christianity. Even during the Renaissance, from Giotto to da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael, which one was not a great painter who painted the Virgin Mary, Jesus, the cross, and large paintings for churches? At that time, the subjects of paintings, with the exception of very few portraits, were completely inseparable from the Old and New Testaments. After the Renaissance, although painting gradually broke away from religion, escaped from temples to breathe some fresh air, and developed towards worldly objects, such as portrait painting, historical painting, and landscape painting, religious painting did not disappear completely. It was not until the emergence of new painting schools such as realism, romanticism, impressionism, and post-impressionism in modern times that painting completely broke away from the shackles of religion and was no longer controlled by religious figures.</p>
<p>The situation of Chinese painting is similar to that of Western painting in some ways. Since Buddhism was introduced to China in the Eastern Han Dynasty, it gradually developed, and the power of Buddhism spread throughout the country. The belief in Buddhism filled all levels, from emperors to common people. Its power was almost the same as that of Christianity in the Middle Ages in the West. Along with Buddhism came not only the scriptures, but also the architectural advancements of temples and the sculpture of Buddha statues. In painting, because of the introduction of Buddha statues, the worship of idols, and the encouragement of merit, 曹不興 in the Three Kingdoms period began painting Buddhas. After the Six Dynasties, Sui, and Tang Dynasties, it became the golden age of Buddhist painting. Almost all great painters painted Buddhist paintings, such as Gu Kaizhi, Lu Tanwei, Zhang Sengyao, Cao Zhongda, Wu Daozi, and Lu Lengjia, all of whom were masters in this field, and Wu Daozi was especially famous. At that time, many Buddhist temples were built, and Buddhist statues or scenes from Buddhist scriptures, such as the transformation of hell, were painted on the walls of the temples. These murals were all commissioned to famous artists of the time. Unfortunately, many Buddhist temples were later destroyed, and the murals were also lost. The only remaining ones now are the murals in the Dunhuang Grottoes. In recent years, after the discovery by Europeans and Americans and the attention of Chinese people, they have gradually spread to the world. My friend Zhang Daqian, a famous painter of today, spent more than two years living there, making copies of many murals. After the murals had been lost for thousands of years, Zhang revived them, which can be said to be a monumental achievement. However, after all, the era of Buddhist painting has long passed, and it is only an opportunity for a kind of curious and antiquarian appreciation. Buddhist painting can no longer be revived.</p>
<p>After the development of landscape painting in the Tang Dynasty, Buddhist painting gradually declined. By the Song Dynasty, the position of Buddhism had been completely replaced by landscape painting. Only one or two famous Buddhist painters remained, such as Li Gonglin. After that, there were no more great painters who specialized in painting Buddhas. During the heyday of Buddhism, Taoism also had considerable influence in the Tang and Song Dynasties, almost on par with Buddhism. Therefore, Chinese painting of Taoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism became a specialized subject. Although there are still people who paint Buddha statues, Arhats, Guanyin, Taishang Laojun, and the Eight Immortals, it has become a vassal of figure painting, unable to form a school of its own, and there are no more masters. The immortals and Buddhas painted now have gradually changed from religious symbols of worship to artistic objects for appreciation. Chinese painting was exploited by politicians for thousands of years and by religious figures for a thousand years. On the one hand, painting, with the power of politics and religion, flourished for thousands of years. It cannot be denied that it benefited from politics and religion. But on the other hand, because of "usurping the host's role" and "sacrificing oneself for others," painting could not develop normally, and even people misunderstood the inherent value of painting itself, which was also a great loss.</p>

<h3>Flying Together (97)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Li Hua was caressed by Dong Shaoling as if she were a child. The sadness and grievances in her heart were stuck in her throat, and she couldn't speak! She wanted to tell Huang Shaoling: it's not that I can't bear to part with Kaifeng, it's that I can't bear to part with him, it's that I'm in pain because of leaving him, and that I'm sad because of leaving him. But she opened her mouth and couldn't say it! Many words crawled like earthworms in her throat, making her itch. Finally, she couldn't help but throw herself into Dong Shaoling's arms and cry!</p>
<p>"Don't cry! Don't cry! Xiao Hua, good girl! Don't cry!" Dong Shaoling said, patting her. He took out his own handkerchief and wiped away her tears.</p>
<p>Dong Shaoling was also moved, but he never realized Li Hua's deep feelings! He thought she was afraid of the unfamiliar new environment in Wuhan; he misunderstood that she was reluctant to leave Kaifeng and the girls' school, because he knew Li Hua was a very studious child. He guessed this way, so his comfort could not touch Li Hua's pain and stop her from being sad.</p>
<p>And Li Hua at this time, didn't blame Dong Shaoling for not being able to understand her feelings? She only blamed herself for not being able to frankly tell Dong Shaoling the truth? She hated herself for being too cowardly, but she could not break through this invisible line of shyness! Because of Dong Shaoling's tender comfort, she felt a rush of heat running through her veins. Her heart was lit with fire!</p>
<p>"Will you come to Wuhan too?" Li Hua finally asked in a trembling voice.</p>
<p>"Maybe I'll come! At that time, I will definitely go to see your plays every day!" Dong Shaoling replied with a smile, even he himself didn't know if this was reliable, because he had never prepared to go to Wuhan.</p>
<p>"Then, when you come, write a letter to Mr. Liu, and I will go with her to pick you up!" Li Hua said with a little relief.</p>
<p>"Okay. When you get there, when you have time, spend more time with Mr. Liu reading and writing; don't be pessimistic and shed tears; be happy, laugh! Do you hear me? Laugh!" Dong Shaoling told her earnestly.</p>
<p>"I hear you!" Li Hua nodded, and sure enough, she raised her face and smiled at him slightly.</p>

<h3>The Spirit of the Youth League</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>A few days ago, I wrote an article "Children's Park" and made a suggestion to the Shanghai Branch of the Youth League. The next day, I received a reply from the branch. I am very happy to introduce this letter to my readers:</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I read Mr. Bu Shaofu's short article in your newspaper's supplement "Free Talk" yesterday, which made a suggestion to our league. We are very grateful for your kindness. Our office is currently dividing a portion of the land into various sports fields, including tennis, basketball, volleyball, and small ball courts, which are open to the public. On average, more than 300 to 400 people exercise every day. This measure is clearly in line with your opinion. In the future, our office will also consider the issue of renovating the Children's Park. Thank you very much for your advice.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Three Principles of the People Youth League July 24th</p>
<p>The Youth League's spirit of readily accepting good advice and acting quickly makes me both happy and gives me a lot of courage. I often have a kind of self-confidence, a self-confidence that my speaking attitude must be cautious, my basis must be objective, and the object must be an event that the public wants to shout out but cannot express. Although there are occasional shortcomings in my knowledge and a lack of depth in my observations, the motive is pure, and I welcome anyone's guidance. Therefore, I never dare to underestimate myself, thinking that "the speaker is earnest, but the listener is indifferent," and that no one takes it seriously.</p>
<p>As long as it's not malicious, as long as you have perseverance, people will respect your opinion. I know that the Public Works Bureau Director Zhao Zengyu is paying close attention to many of the suggestions made in this publication for improving traffic, and is already studying solutions.</p>
<p>I am very grateful to the branch. It has strengthened my self-confidence and increased my courage. However, I hope that the branch can promote the realization of the renovation of the Children's Park as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Dedicated to Doctors</h3>
<p>— Wu Shuangren</p>
<p>Shen Bao's "Free Talk" had an article on the ninth of this month, "I'm Afraid of Doctors," and another article by a Mr. X on the thirteenth, "I Love Doctors." The intentions of the two authors are completely opposite. Readers have long wanted to contribute a few words about the doctors of this year, and taking this opportunity, I will join in the fun.</p>
<p>I love doctors is a matter of course and also people's common feelings. I'm afraid of doctors is an angry statement, issued for a reason. Because a person cannot avoid illness, and doctors treat illness, making those who are treated return to health. Therefore, in the eyes of patients, doctors are seen as angels who save people from suffering, and should be "loved"—"afraid" is abnormal.</p>
<p>The author has not seen the original "I'm Afraid of Doctors," and only knows from the "I Love Doctors" article that there is such an article. So what does the original article say? I don't know. However, based on the author's observations of some doctors in recent years, I have accumulated many opinions; like bones stuck in the throat, I must express them. Now, I respectfully tell them as follows:</p>
<p>Birth, aging, sickness, and death are inevitable for people. If the disease is incurable and one is dying, and death is coming sooner or later, then one should accept it and not have any hope. The most important thing is non-fatal illnesses. Reviving the dying and removing the demon of disease is the doctor's duty. Whether a disease can be cured quickly is based on three conditions: first, accurate diagnosis and prescribing the right medicine; second, the timing, the sooner the treatment starts, the better; third, the doctor's medical skills and medical ethics. The author sincerely knows that there are many enthusiastic doctors who are willing to sacrifice their own flesh to save others, and who are highly skilled in medicine, and who can cure diseases with their hands. However, there are also those who are only interested in profit, who not only perfunctorily treat patients, but even deliberately delay the process; there are also those who are careless and impetuous, who examine patients casually, and use inappropriate medicines, so that acute illnesses are delayed and eventually become incurable; there are even those who know that their academic skills are limited and cannot treat the disease, but who still seek consultation fees and are unwilling to give way to others. All of these violate one or all of the three conditions, sacrificing the patient. I hope modern art can quickly improve this! The author recalls that during the enemy puppet period, the people who were injured in air raids in various places were bleeding non-stop. With great difficulty, they were sent to the hospital in freight cars, but everywhere refused to accept them; some hospitals accepted them, but did not immediately provide emergency treatment. Due to the delay, countless people were sent to the city of the dead. Recently, the tiger plague has been prevalent in various places, and hospitals have experienced the above phenomenon again because they are full. I think doctors, based on humanitarianism, should try to find ways to help as much as possible when there is no way.</p>
<p>Finally, there are a few additional warnings: In recent years, medical expenses and drug prices have been increasing day by day, so that ordinary patients cannot afford to see a doctor and take medicine, and therefore the number of people who die from misdiagnosis has reached a very high number. There are also too strict medical practices, such as not making house calls late at night; not making house calls on Sundays; and regardless of the patient's poverty, charging special fees for "early morning" and "late night" consultations outside of the prescribed hours. In the author's opinion: service is the first priority in life. Those who use it as a profession, of course, cannot ignore family expenses and aim to increase income. But I hope that everything has some flexibility! Especially the flexible accommodation of money and time, which is of great benefit to patients. Then those who are afraid of doctors will all become lovers of doctors.</p>
<h3>A Third Party's Opinion</h3>
<p>— You Fu</p>
<p>All the people of Shanghai are hoping that there will be a good way to improve the traffic, so that the 3.7 million citizens can be satisfied in terms of "traveling."</p>
<p>I consulted my American teacher, a third party, on this issue.</p>
<p>When I told her about the current traffic situation in Shanghai, she very frankly gave a few points based on her ten years of experience living in Shanghai: and I hope to pass these points on to the authorities responsible for directing and managing traffic.</p>
<p>She said! "Why is the traffic order in Shanghai bad, and people are often run over? There are the following reasons:</p>
<p>1.  Various vehicles do not drive at the prescribed speed.</p>
<p>2.  There are too many rickshaws and handcarts in the middle of the road.</p>
<p>3.  When vehicles stop at intersections and then move forward, they do not follow the order of priority. In the United States, there is absolutely no such situation. The order of vehicles is not at all chaotic.</p>
<p>4.  Most pedestrians who are not in vehicles do not travel on the sidewalks, but walk on the road. Sidewalks are equivalent to being useless.</p>
<p>5.  Too many businesses do business on the road, such as newspaper stalls, mobile cigarette stalls, shoe shine stands, travel bags, combs, and other retail stalls. All of these affect traffic on the sidewalks.</p>
<p>6.  Rickshaws and handcarts are not allowed to pass through Nanjing Road from 8:00 to 12:00. Then, like automobiles, other small roads should also be prohibited from passing through during the above time.</p>
<p>If the above six problems are earnestly improved, I believe that Shanghai's traffic order will be at least much better than it is now.</p>
<p>I am very grateful for the opinions of this third party. Although this opinion is very ordinary, traffic is originally an ordinary matter. I'm just afraid that you can't even accept ordinary opinions, and that the methods that everyone knows, at the very least, cannot be implemented, then you can only continue to make things worse forever!</p>
<h3>Traitor Relying on Foreign Powers, Macao Tycoon Not Arrested</h3>
<p>— Fang Jun</p>
<p>A tycoon is different from ordinary people after all. Since the Guangdong General Headquarters announced the second list of traitors, Gao Kening has been protected by the local government—Macao. According to reports in the local newspapers a few days ago: he not only has armed police escorting him in and out, but his residence also has six lines of defense, forming a fortress. This is truly majestic, not even the head of any country is like this. The "salty shrimp" authorities' so close protection made Gao Kening feel overwhelmed and grateful. From the "salty shrimp" side, they also felt it was appropriate and thorough, and they were self-satisfied and not doing anything beyond their means.</p>
<p>Gao Kening was originally one of the three mountains and five mountains of that place and had a reputation in Hong Kong. He has always been known as "Uncle Gao." He also supported a group of thugs in that place, not a few. Especially, his contribution to the "salty shrimp" authorities was very large. He donated monthly and paid annually, both of which were considerable and amazing figures. His contribution was also to increase the prosperity of that place a lot. He was a living "God of Wealth Bodhisattva" of that place. Perhaps, like one of the thirty-six Guanyin images in Tantric Buddhism (one of the Guanyin images in Tantric Buddhism is male), he was the "savior Guanyin" of "salty shrimp." Because in his career, he was the largest blood vessel of "salty shrimp." In fact, he was the largest life artery of "salty shrimp." Whoever cherishes the life artery. When "salty shrimp" gave him this special favor and gave him close protection, from this point of view, "salty shrimp" still wanted to cherish its largest life artery! The sudden thunder of the Guangdong General Headquarters (the second list was actually announced by the Traitor Committee) startled "salty shrimp"! But his concern for Gao Kening was not without reason!</p>
<p>The actual situation of "salty shrimp's" increased protection of Gao Kening is probably like this; or there may be other sufficient reasons, which are difficult to measure. However, the "thunder" of Guangdong has struck, whether there will be torrential rain, we have to wait for future practical proof. However, it is related to the "salty shrimp's" life artery. The six lines of defense around his residence are probably set up for this meaning!</p>
<p>What Gao Kening has today is what he never dreamed of before, a beggar singing dragon boat songs on a ferry. The beggar singing dragon boat songs held a dragon boat in his hand. The dragon boat was made of wood, about two feet long and half a foot wide, carved into an open-mouthed dragon head, painted in various colors, and attached with gold leaf. It looked elegant and refined. There were holes in the wooden pieces in front of the dragon's mouth for people to catch incense. Below the dragon's head was a boat shape, with several wooden puppets holding oars on both sides. Below, a red cloth was wrapped, with a handle in the middle, several feet long, which could be held by hand or carried on the shoulder. This is the so-called dragon boat. The beggar wore a small gong on his chest, pressed a small drum below, and held a small wooden pestle in his left hand. When singing, the sound of gongs and drums was rhythmic. The lyrics were also fixed, always some auspicious phrases. Gao Kening spent a long time on the ferry like that. How could he have expected that his gambling luck would be prosperous and he would become a "tycoon" in Macao? — The life artery of "salty shrimp." From today's situation, "salty shrimp" can't do without him. But, it seems that he can't do without "salty shrimp" either.</p>
<p>"The wolf cannot walk without the crippled wolf, the crippled wolf cannot walk without the wolf." Gao Kening should now call out Li Mi's famous saying: "My advance and retreat are truly embarrassing"! Then, "salty shrimp" must also say: "I cannot be where I am today without my grandmother, and my grandmother cannot finish her years without me."</p>
<p>However, Gao Kening can also be considered majestic. Among all the officials, when have we seen anyone receive such preferential treatment from "salty shrimp"! But be careful, it is said that after Lu Mengzheng became a high official, he could not avoid getting a cold sore on his finger and losing sight for a night. After all, a poor beggar cannot bear preferential treatment. Don't forget that when "sleeping" and "covering" the mat, in the layers of close protection, a finger stretched out, causing a cold sore and contracting an incurable disease.</p>
<p>A Few Words</p>
<h3>Holding Rice and Grain Loans, Troubles Accountants Twice</h3>
<p>— Wuling Ren</p>
<p>It is rumored that after Zhou Fohai and other traitors were escorted to prison near Chongqing, they were recently discovered to be enjoying themselves in luxurious dance halls with wine and women. I dare to confirm that this news is definitely not true, otherwise a group of people in the loyal character prison would have jointly raised questions.</p>
<p>After the abolition of unequal treaties, the Shanghai Local Court heard two cases in which foreigners were sued. One was the case of the white sailors and the black sailors in Shanghai. As a result, the punishment suffered by the defendant, Wanda, was not very severe, but the court paid a sum of money for the witnesses' living expenses. The other was the case of the Chinese merchant Zhongyuan Shipping Company suing the British firm. As a result, Zhongyuan lost the case and had to bear more than 18 million yuan in litigation costs. These two cases can secretly make foreigners admire the impartial attitude of our court in handling cases in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>When the rice and grain awards were first handled, accountants had to be troubled to review them, and a corruption case occurred. Accountants also had to be asked to check the accounts. Accountants also had to attend the disaster relief dance. Accountants can be said to be "popular" to the extreme today. It is expected that they will also be troubled in the process of accepting the work of the work inspection team.</p>
<p>Raincoats made of glass are also sold in the windows of national goods companies, which is gratifying.</p>
<p>Seventeen-year-old black man Willie Francis was sentenced to death for murder. After sitting in the electric chair, he happened to survive because the electric gate was damaged. The authorities believe that it would be too cruel to execute him again, so they may commute his sentence to life imprisonment. But some people also argue that the pain of life imprisonment is said to be worse than the death penalty. In this case, then</p>
<p>"Putting people to death" can sometimes be said to be humane and contains the meaning of "compassion"?</p>

<h3>Sent to My Deceased Wife, Fengjun (18)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>What is strange is that you have been gone for more than two months, but what exactly are you busy with? Why don't you come to me in my dreams? Could it be that you have become a transcendent being, forgetting all about your old companion of twenty-nine years? Could it be that you have lost your way and can no longer recognize the lanes and alleys of this old garden? Could it be that your eyes are blurred and you cannot see, among the lush greenery at the head of Wang Chang River, this wooden shed where I am now singing and weeping? Could it be that you have forgotten your beloved youngest son, Er, who has just finished his summer exams and is at home raising pigeons, and you don't want to come and see if he is being naughty? Don't you see the Ligustrum flowers blooming brilliantly at the tips of the tall poplars; don't you see the Lonicera on the Mei Qiu rocks, blooming a second time with glistening white flowers; don't you see the new lotus emerging from the water in the lotus pond under the plum house, swaying in the breeze like emerald canopies? These are all things you loved when you were alive, why don't you come and appreciate them? Alas! Feng, oh Feng! Since you don't come to me in my dreams, I don't know where to find you, so I can only tell everything to your portrait, not knowing if you can hear me or not? Sometimes, when I want something, I unconsciously call out your name, thinking that you are still by my side; sometimes, when I hear some interesting news outside, I excitedly rush back to tell you, but as soon as I step into the doorway, I suddenly realize that you are no longer in this world. Alas! Feng, oh Feng! Although your physical body is dead, your great spirit will live forever in my heart, forever immortal!</p>
<p>After I had you buried, I listened to the advice of my sworn brother Zhenhou and went to Shanghai for a stroll, staying at his place; he and his wife, in order to comfort me, gave me extraordinary enjoyment in terms of daily life and diet. On the eighth day of the fifth month, it was my small birthday, and they specially made noodles, prepared many dishes, and invited our children to come together; their care and concern were even greater than that of blood brothers, which truly moved me to tears, and I don't know how to repay them. I believe that your spirit in heaven must also be deeply grateful. I went to your mother's house twice to visit your mother and aunt. As soon as I saw the two old women, tears could not help but burst out of my eyes. While intermittently recounting the course of your sudden illness, I kept sobbing and could not speak coherently, and even the two of them shed many tears with me. There is also a major event in our family to report to you, which is that our daughter-in-law, Yudai, gave birth to a daughter at 7:30 in the morning of the Dragon Boat Festival at Guangci Hospital. The baby weighed nine pounds, was as white as jade and as lovely as snow. I gave her the name "Ming Ying" and gave her the gold lock piece that her father wore when he was a child. It's a pity that you can't see this lovely little granddaughter. If you saw her, you would definitely be immensely happy.</p>
<p>I stayed in Shanghai for two weeks, and didn't visit several old friends, because if I went, I would have to mention you, and mentioning you would pierce my heart; I believe they will forgive my suffering. My sworn brother Zheng Zipao invited me to dinner and said many powerful words of comfort. He is a very optimistic person and does not know what sorrow is; he advised me to quickly forget this sad history, like reading a book, turning the pages one by one, without having to turn back. We indeed hoped that the couple could grow old together, but those who die are dead and cannot die together, so one might as well find another partner and start anew. My sworn brother Zhenhou and the woman who I cannot forget for thirty years also sincerely advised me, saying that you have always loved me when you were alive and will certainly still care about me after death; for your sake, for the sake of the children, you must not lose heart, you must take care of your health, cheer up, and start a new family. I accepted their advice, and a surge of vitality was added to my body and mind. I decided to start anew and console you in the afterlife.</p>
<h3>Terror, Destruction, Degeneration. The Imagined Third World War - A Speculative Discussion, Listen to it as Such.</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>This is the story of the Third World War. Atomic weapons have been developed to an extreme level. Talented scientists skillfully use these terrifying weapons. The extreme terror of life and matter is arbitrarily manipulated by the great powers. In the first two days of the war, all the major cities in the world and their residents were reduced to ashes.</p>
<p>Building Underground Cities</p>
<p>Anticipating such terror of war, these countries have secretly built many underground cities thousands of feet deep, because these cities are not afraid of atomic weapon bombings, and military leaders, once they begin operations, lead the people to move to underground cities in remote corners of the earth to ensure safety. However, human perseverance can end a global war. Unexpectedly, there are weapons more powerful than atomic bombs and rockets that can be thrown into the final arena. A kind of wireless radio wave melts all metals within a diameter of one hundred miles into liquid slurry. At first, people did not expect its consequences to be so terrifying. Until an airship used an invisible electric light to shoot at the enemy's position, all the cannons, tanks, airplanes, atomic weapons, warships, railways, and all metal objects were pierced by the light wave and melted into liquid slurry. Telephones, radios, electric clocks, electrical appliances, gas, and water supply facilities were all destroyed overnight. Electric wires and iron pipes were softened and bent by the wireless radio wave.</p>
<p>Metal Completely Melted</p>
<p>Skyscrapers and bridge towers were pulverized. Ordinary houses completely disintegrated when steel frames and iron nails melted into liquid slurry. It even made it impossible for the other side to continue fighting with a single iron knife. There was no way to go but unconditional surrender. Later, this secret was detected by spies from a third country, who immediately launched a surprise attack on the first country. After the war broke out, the terrifying situation continued for many days, even more terrifying than a night of harvest. Even airplanes carrying this new type of weapon suffered the same fate as all weapons in the world. When the cities below the ground, built with steel pipe concrete, with honeycomb-like caves inhabited by millions of residents, were bombed, they only expressed surprise at the machine age.</p>
<p>Returning to the Stone Age</p>
<p>Thus, due to their intelligence, mankind returned from the atomic age, through the electrical age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age, and all the paths of evolution, back to the Stone Age. Everything produced from thousands of years of effort was destroyed. From then on, the only tools that humans could manufacture were stone knives and wooden sticks, which were very crude. But the belligerent countries still fought. The weapons used by Stone Age humans were not stone knives and stone spears, but a powerful weapon - microbes. They freely multiplied in the embers after a considerable period and filled the ground, but people did not know their harm. So they could invade humans as much as they wanted, and those masters who created the war were busy killing each other, neglecting this invisible enemy. Microbes have penetrated into all the people in the world. Most of the houses on the ground are covered with mud and grass, and only a few survive, but even they have incomplete doors and windows and collapsed walls.</p>
<p>Disaster Descends on the World</p>
<p>However, it was too late, and several terrible events were about to come. Natural disasters, due to human negligence, suddenly arrived. The electric light that melted metals further affected the ore seedlings buried deep underground. Gradually, but terribly, the rock layers began to move and adjust themselves. Earthquakes occurred everywhere, mountains moved, and vast lands buried countless people. Animals were lucky and could kill any living thing. New volcanoes appeared all over the earth, and piles of molten minerals made the earth's surface extremely fragile. Bursting volcanoes spewed out a kind of molten metal with radio wave effects. At night, the flowing light was everywhere, frightening people. All animals and plants that touched this poisonous gas were completely poisoned. Sinking volcanoes emitted huge amounts of steam, making the air on the ground unsuitable for human breathing.</p>
<p>Total Destruction of Mankind</p>
<p>Due to the collapsing mountains, steaming lakes and seas, uneven roads, burning sparks, and the cries of humans, the earth was slowly transformed into a hellish disturbance. After a few months, the earthquakes rumbled and sank to the bottom, and finally after the silence, the earth was quiet again, only mankind was completely destroyed. When the moon raised its head again and shone on the familiar earth, it only saw huge stone walls, dazzling lake light, and a piece of loneliness, painted blue on the surface of the earth.</p>
