<p>〔本報台北廿一日電〕主席夫婦於下午三時三刻乘　號專機安抵台北，按台渝陷五十餘年來，主席夫婦尙爲首次蒞臨。此間同胞正以最熱烈最興奮之情緒作盛大之歡迎。主席在此將宣慰台胞，並主持台灣光復週年紀念之盛典。（上　爲台灣行政長官公署賓館內景）</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕首都久已停頓之和平商談，今日佳音自天上飛來，飛機塲上政治人物與迎候人員忙碌異常。在皎好之秋陽下，衆入笑口常開，宛如辦喜事。共產黨，靑年黨，民盟及社會賢達在滬代表廿一日晨聯袂目滬分乘中航機及美軍專機自滬返京。主席曾指派吳鐵城，王世杰，孫科，邵力子，曁政協秘書長雷震往迎巾航機於十時十分抵達，機門啓處，吳鐵城，王世杰，首先趨前歡迎。羅隆基最先下機，李維漢次之，繼各代表魚貫而下。計靑年黨代表曾琦，左舜生，陳啓天，李璜，余家菊，楊永浚；及秘書劉鵬九，民盟張君勱沈鈞儒，黃炎培，羅隆　，章伯鈞，蔣勻田及秘書徐傳霖。社會賢達胡霖郭沫若。共產黨李維漢，陳家康等十九人。吳氏與來者一一握手，並代主席致意時，諸氏均露愉快之色。下機後，記者會分別請諸氏發表抵京感想”彼等答覆大抵雷同，即「很高興」胡霖稱，「我是送客來的」蓋胡定即晚乘車返滬也。李璜稱：今日飛行平穩，順利抵京，實象徵商談之遠景。郭沫若稱：希望和平能成功。羅隆　稱：今日之莊　塲面，爲上海談判結果。此非正式之會議，，進行順利，則停戰即可實現，因今日應爲中國人解決中國人之問題。陳家康稱，中共願追隨各黨派社會賢達及中國人民爲正義立功，爲民主和平而奮鬥。沈鈞儒稱，第三方面人士此次到京，期能圓滿解決問題，惟此種工作甚爲艱鉅。</p>
<p>諸氏在熙攘之人羣中停留的二分鐘，空氣甚爲和諧。旋即隨同吳鐵城，王世杰，雷震三氏登車至國民參政會休　。</p>
<p>記者旋赴大校塲機場往迎周恩來，周氏專機於十時四十分着陸，周氏首先下機，對往迎之孫科，邵力子致謝意，旋即與孫氏握手，攝影，記者均爭取此好鏡頭。周氏着淡灰色西服，面現微笑，記者請其發表談話，拒而不言，旋即偕孫邵登東赴參政會，邵氏辦公室中乃成風雲人物大集會。記者羅復採各個擊破方式，請各人發表意見，忙碌之中頗有辦喜事之感。</p>
<p>十一時全體代表即赴國府謁蔣主席，主席戎裝全備，整裝待發，見諸氏後，表示無限欣慰，並面詢周恩來：「你有什麼意見？」周答，「按照政協議決，我們都是同意的」。主席旋吿以台灣之行。又稱，「原定二日前即將前往，旋以各位將至，故留二天，今日諸位來很好，以後商談時，由孫院長主持，盼能即日開始，並迅速完成」。一刻鐘後，各代表分別辭返寓邸。中午十二時半，再應政府代表之宴，赴國際聯歡社，午餐之後進行非正式交換意見，至下午三時始畢。席間首由孫科致詞，旋周恩來•梁漱溟·黃炎培·羅隆基·張君勱·李璜諸氏，均提出意見。</p>

<p>按今日所談，仍爲濱泛交換意見，並對政府所提八項意見加以解釋與研究，未獲獲具體結果，將於廿二日續行集會，同時對和跌程序亦曾提及</p>
<p>李璜，左舜生，胡霖三氏，於十一時夜車返滬，聞李左定廿二日夜車再行返京。李行前對廿一日集會商談情形語記者稱：吾人目前縱有萬分困難，亦將努力以赴，若干悲觀論調不必過分渲染。總之，今日在此興奮空氣中，極盼能有所收穫也。</p>
<p>又梁漱溟吿記者，目前局勢仍甚危險，共黨代表此來似亦屬可嘉之事，惟可能即爲彼等返延安之第一步。彼等此來犧牲決心，大過於求妥協之心，商談中　有危機，吾人仍盼有所忍受，必須有和平的保證力。目前危機，雖有馬歇爾代表友邦爲吾人謀和平，但力量有限，其工作亦爲被動者，吾人認爲目前要第三方面團結一致，自動的組成和平的保證力，「以中國人爲主，以美國人爲輔」，以此力處置此間題，即吾人認爲，公正的意見，必須採納否則將追究其責任誰　，並盼能即予第三方面以機會，與聞軍事，並非參加軍事三人會議，而爲會外的交換意見，作爲橋樑，以促成三人會議之成功。</p>

<p>〔本報南京二十一日電〕首都高院廿一日晨首次公審周佛海，旁聽羣衆近萬，秩序極壞，開首都審奸史新紀錄。六時，旁聽者絡繹面至，大成殿內外人顧　集，記者席　政府首長席均爲侵佔一空。審判長趙琛院長，七時四十分簽發提票，八時半將周逆解抵高院候審室，此時大成殿殿門緊閉，殿外擁擠益甚，雖經總指揮葛召棠推事多方　論，亦無效果，延至上午九時五十分，趙琛院長，哀之單，金世　兩庭長及陳繩檢察官，書記長羅萃儒，於雜亂中升庭，憲警費　氣力，始在人海中　出小徑，押周逆入庭。周逆穿灰布長衫，藍灰色褲，灰襪黑圓口皮鞋，御六棱無框近成眼鏡，目睹此澎湃之人潮，極感狼狽，面色陡變。登大殿石階時，竟顧　顫巍，步上公堂，立於被吿席上，時常口角抽搔，以微抖之手捻十行簿三册，支扶席案，旋以手帕拭汗，　視其辯護律師章士劍·王善祥·楊嘉麟三人。審判長高呼：「維持秩序」後，即開始審訊。</p>
<p>庭上先訊以姓名。年齡。籍貫，京市住址，及工作等，周逆於難亂聲中，大喊「周佛海、五十歲，湖南沅陵人，住南京西流灣八號。」旋由檢察官宣讀起訴書，對其參加日偽賣國談判，媚敵叛國之罪行，及其所稱自首一節，實徒託空言，以早已於廿八年十一月四日爲最高法院檢察署以明令通緝，即有亦不能成立，妄邀減刑兩點，特別加重。旋審判長復訊家屬財產，據供：家中共有妻子楊淑　，子少海，年二千八歲，成都軍校畢業：女淑海·慧海，妹佛珍；所有房產，京市祗西流灣八號住宅一所，的十五六間，上海有湖南路二六二號住宅一棟·的七八間，另愚園路等處出租房屋六棟，其他動產等請看軍統局調査表。</p>

<p>續訊其出身，及與戰前所任之職位後，庭上問以「國民政府部長作過吾」？答「未」，問：「想作吾」？答「想當然想，但想不到，不能作，不過政府部長是特任黨部部長却是選任，還要大些」。間：「曾否出席中央政治會議」。答「是列席」。聞：「那麽你當然知道國家的抗戰國策，也曾參與懲治漢奸治罪條例的制訂，爲什麼還作漢奸」？周逆語塞。片刻，始再闡述其漢奸哲學，謂：「當時離渝參加僞方是政治上另一看法，今已自知錯誤，法律責任不敢辭，但在彼時國際環境欠佳，戰局不利，而對抗戰無信心之際，認爲和平未始非救國之一途，復不願在後方主持和平，影響抗戰，故決定犠牲個人來淪陷區主張和平，到京後，知行爲錯誤，積極設法自首，效忠中央」。周逆並强調在中宜部代部長任內，從未發表任何不利抗戰之言論。審判長責謂：「那麽你是表面抗戰，骨子裏「和平」了」？周逆支吾半日，始稱：「和平是無裏表的」。對「低調俱樂部」，周逆謂「僅係胡適之先生一句玩笑，並無組織。在京時與江逆無往來，僅自高宗武處得悉，汪亦唱低調主和平」。其後，又滔滔叙述其附逆之經過，略以「與日方今井·影佐洽和，乃梅思平與高宗武所爲，彼未參與，和平條件，注逆與其談過，其容爲善隣友好，承認「滿洲國」經濟提携，共同防共三點，彼以不是亡國條件，可考慮，但有三先決條件，即日本內閣通過，（二）日本御前會議通過，（三）公吿世界。日方均照辦，汪逆極堅決，梅逆更過之，彼則以信心不定，乃跟了來。並狡稱。「現今甚悔離偷之舉，應受處分，但在京五年，則係奮鬥歷史，若因之　罪，實難甘心。」周逆繼供，僞府之各種措施及其個人行爲，對召開僞六全代會，推諉爲林柏生等改組派所爲，對僞府還都宣言，否定國府在渝一切法令及組織事，推諉爲汪逆兆銘獨斷；對知錯後仍戀棧於僞府，則詭稱欲「積極立功。」對組織僞府，狡稱爲寗漢京平兩次分裂之再演；對與日人訂約事，爲與「小孩子」的的束，並否認曾過問僞軍委會公務，參加淸鄕委員會會議，主持毒化靑年工作，及副署對英美官戰書等事。多經庭上對證事實及其漢奸言論，予以駁責，周進乃連聲「知罪」！「後悔」！並稱：「在行爲上不能推諉責任，心底襄確是爲本國，可說是「通謀敵國，以圖救濟本國！」庭上復斥以「通謀敵國」非反抗本國爲何，若許作爲，足當你通敵叛國之事實證據，不容狡辯。周逆乃嘿然稱：「決不想賴。」</p>

<p>台灣光復瞬逾一年，日前京滬記者團旣歸自台灣，帶來了關於台灣的忠實報道，蔣主席又於昨日飛往合灣視察，關於台灣的施政，應爲各方所關住。台灣倫陷垂五十年，這五十年來台灣人民飽當日本軍閥統治的苦味。今茲山河重光，我全國人民對於台灣的重歸祖國懷抱，表示無限的興奮。在政府方面，我元首以日理萬幾之身，南飛視察，足見我主席對合灣的施政及台灣人民如何關注。台灣在我民族歷史上，原有燦爛的過去，明季鄭成功以台灣爲基地而反抗異族的入侵，英烈悲壯，爲我民族樹立了良好的典範，保留了我民族的正氣；迨至淸季，以迄晚近，台灣人民對於民族的忠誠，猶能秉鄭成功的遺風，再接再厲多所表現。在民族意識上台灣人民因之也可以說特別堅强。今茲重返故國，合灣人民的心情興舊，與我們之見台灣兄弟的歸來，彼此同之。</p>
<p>我們特別應該珍視這種情感上的交流，這是這種情感上的交流使整個民族凝成牢不可破的固體，台灣人民今茲歸來，所望於祖國者或至股切，而　國統治在台灣之重建，或未必能盡如台灣人民的理想，倘使有這種狀態的存在，這是可以了解的。台灣的光復不過一年，在施政方面，或未能盡如一般人的預期、我們需要忍耐；在政府，對於台灣的施政，允應於遂行國策之中，尊重台灣人民的意向，我們不能失掉臺灣的民心。如今台灣重歸祖國懷抱，在以三民主義爲我建國的最高指導原則下，台灣應該成爲三民主義建設的理想實驗區域。</p>
<p>講到台灣現行的政制，其所以與內地各省有別者，原爲因時因地制宜的過渡辦法。在原則上，我們反對地方政治的特殊化，就般適用於各省的法制，自應同樣適用於台灣；可是至少在目前，我們不能不承認臺灣施政的特殊化爲一種朋智的決策。臺灣久受日本的統治，日人又積極推行同化政策，所以今日的台灣似乎還未能將過去日本軍閥統治的惡果剷除盡凈。在這個過渡時期，台灣特殊化似有其必要。這特殊化的形態表現於行政長官制度的建立，在法幣系統之外別有特別的發行。凡此措施，其目的原是爲謀台灣人民的福利。法幣在台灣的暫停使用，與夫台幣的成爲通貨，原在防制國內通貨彭脹的惡果及於臺灣，使台灣的幣制金融得以趨於穩定。然而據台灣省參議會議長黃朝琴談稱：「台灣金融較國內穩定，但在台胞看來，比日本佔領時代更壞，經濟更痛苦，其原因爲通貨膨脤，物價高漲。」此言旣出於代表民意的參議會議長，諒非無因。所以我，們要在此地喚起台灣當局的注意。我們曉得台幣在合灣當局控制之下，縱使發行數額微有增加，似乎不致造成惡性的通貨膨，但旣然物價有高漲的趨勢，則這種頹風應該早。設法制止</p>
<p>從現在展望到將來，臺灣旣應該成爲三民主義建設的理想實騐區，關於此後台灣施政方面，我們不能忽略了其中應該注意的若干點。臺灣受日本統治五十年，在過去五十年中，所有在台灣的施政，均以日本本國爲中心，爲出發點。如今河山重光，我們斷不能讓這部遣產承襲過來，今後台灣的施政應以中國爲本位，爲中心，爲出發點。本此原則，我們應該提高台灣人民在文化，政治乃至經濟各方面的地位。在文化方面，過去台胞受高等敎育的人數不多，我們此後應提高台胞的文化教育水準。其中特別應該致力的是：我們必須在最短期內將台灣人民的文化思想與內地的同胞打成一片。過去五十年，台胞在日本軍閥的奴役統治下，今日允應消滅狹隘的地域觀念，恢復自尊自信，與全國同胞攜手向建國的大道邁進，以達成我國的民族復興。</p>
<p>關於台灣資源的開發和利用，在日本軍閥統治時期，原已具有相當規模；但我們應該注意過去合灣的經濟發展全以日本爲中心，而且全以日本國防的需要爲中心。在今日的臺灣留下有日本人所經營的石油廠和　鋁工業，而台灣本無巨量鋁及石油的蘊　和生產。在農業方面，台灣地　多山，本不宜於蔗糖的生產，爲了日本本國的需要，於是迫使台灣農民放棄在經濟上爲有利的糧食的生產，而從事於蔗糖的生產。　在日本或有其必要，但我們決不能讓這種局勢持續下去。台灣的經濟發展應該移置到我國內地適當的地點。同時若干工業在台灣爲經濟上之有利的，應該扶持其發展。例如台灣樟腦工業的生產，本居世界生產額的百分之八十，如今因爲代用品的發明，　腦在國際市塲上的需要已不如前。如何傳這種台灣特有的工　有健全的發展以及如何使台灣的經濟建設與整個民族的經濟建設相配合，是一個值得研究計劃的課題。</p>
<p>復次，臺灣的公有土地占台灣土地總面積的百分之七十。這正是實行三民主義土地政策的理想區域。公有士地所占的百分比旣如此之高，則「耕者有其田」的理想，三民主義的土地政策可以得到充分的實現。我們以台灣爲三民主義建設的理想實騐區，實因台灣具備有各種的必要條件。我們願重　到祖國懷抱來的台灣，能　給全國以一種示範的作用。後來居上，他日全國各地說不定還得向臺灣多多有所學習。對於這個祟高使命的完成，深信　切手足的台胞是必然會樂於支持的。我們謹以熱烈的手握着我們的台胞，願在此後的建國大　上彼此携手　進。民族復興，庶其有豸。</p>

<p>我們浙東旅滬的同鄕，在人口的比例上計算，當爲他省人士之冠。在抗戰以前，滬浙交通很便如往鎭海，鄞縣，象山，奉化，慈谿，餘姚，上盧等處的，都可於下午四五時搭乘滬甬綫航輪第二天都可到達各自的家鄉。因爲那時寗波的交通工具完備，如甬曹段鐵路的火車，鄞，鎭，慈，觀，曹段公路的長途汽車，和開往各處的小火輪，眞是便利梔了，而且金錢時間，都很經濟。</p>
<p>敵僞時期，浙東遭淪陷後，交通口岸都被敵人封鎭，有時或有滬甬綫航輪行駛，因爲寗波的交通工具破壞，所以要到餘姚上虞等地的旅客，非三四天到家不可；而且購船票手續的麻煩，上船時候的排隊和檢査行李的嚴格，嘗過這種滋味的人，是永遠不會遺忘的。如果航輪不通的時候，那末我們祗有改乘帆船，惟須先到曹涇</p>
<p>（在松江縣屬的海濱）再搭帆船赴浙東沿海，這種帆船大都是裝貨用的，所以汚穢不堪，而且很多危險，常有傾覆沉沒等事發生。</p>
<p>自從勝利以後，各處交通口岸完全開放，這是大家都很欣喜的。滬甬線雖有招商局的定期航輪行駛，但是所包括旅客的範圍，並不廣泛，多數屬於甬籍旅客，因爲寗波的交通工具遭戰時破壞後，所以要到餘姚上虞等地的旅客，甚至還要在中途夜宿，如上述行旅的不便，都放棄滬甬綫航輪，而改搭滬杭路火車，至杭州過錢江，搭錢娥公路（錢江至曹娥）長途汽車到曹娥，再分往各自目的地。依照目前兩路局滬杭路行車時刻的規定，第一班開行的是上午六時四十五分的特別快車，到杭州是十一點半，過錢江至汽車站搭車，已在下午一二點鐘，到曹娥的時候，已須五點多鐘，如果曹娥江再在百官雇船，或者步行三四十里路的話，那就不行了。因爲鄕間地方上的不安靖，而且盜匪路劫的事時有發生，所以必須在百官過宿，要第二天才可抵家，可是在金錢上和時間上太不經濟了，尤其是我們薪水階級的小店員們。爲了上述的苦難，我想請兩路局加開滬杭路夜車（慢車），最好在午夜十二點鐘開，於早晨六點半鐘到杭州，那末我們寗紹兩屬的同鄕，都可當天到家，不必再在中途過夜了。不但金錢可以節省，就是時間上也經濟不少，不知兩路當局可以照辦嗎？</p>
<p>（邵炳榮）</p>
<p>妥定全市路名門牌</p>
<p>自日僞時代，把上海路名，大多數改過，並把舊鐵質路牌搬走，記憶上殊感不便。勝利後，我政府又重新再改路名，除重要幾條出名馬路，有顯明標記外，如南市，虹口，滬西等處的許多小馬路，石子路，尤其在大馬路的轉角，旣無路牌標記，且門牌號數，亦無一定標準，實使市民尋覓時，有無所適從之概！例如上海四川北路，虬江路，邢家橋路等，這幾條路頗附名，沒有路牌，大家都還知道，北四川路門牌，亦有藍自二色，在老上海者或無風謂，初到上海同胞，事實上辨認困難。謹希市政當局在最近期內，先把全市門牌號數訂好，再把路名標記做好，以利市民，實爲公便。（洪）</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社安加拉廿一日電〕蘇聯二次要求與土耳其共管韃靼海峽，土國復牒已斷然加以拒絕。復牒內容頃已發表，其中否認蘇聯關於戰時德國船隻通過海峽之指責，並謂，蘇聯政府倘堅持不已，土國惟有以此事凝付國際仲裁。土耳其茲作下列之建議：（一）修訂蒙德婁公的關於各國船隻通過海峽之一條，（二）公約條文中所有關於「國際聯盟」字樣，代以「聯合國機構」字樣，（三）自簽的國名字中剔出日本，代以美國。</p>
<p>照會中續稱，土耳其政府同意修訂公約，但不能承認戰時破壞該約之責任。以言蘇聯來照中</p>
<p>之第四項，即由黑海沿岸各國單獨負責訂立新公約一項，土國政府認爲蘇聯此種主張與國際公法不合，因黑海與土耳其海峽問題，不能視爲僅與黑海沿岸各國有關，國際公法固有明文規定也。黑海不能認爲封閉之海，蘇聯要求共管海峽礙難贊同，因此舉不　使土國與某一外國共享主權，是而可忍，孰不可忍？海峽他日若果遭受攻擊時，蘇聯儘可採取最善之解決方法，即將國防軍與聯合國警衛軍混合，負責制止侵略。蘇聯蔑視土耳其主權，强欲使其就範，誠不知居心何在？若謂土國拒絕此種要求，有損蘇聯威望，亦屬不近情理。依土耳其政府觀之，土國之榮譽威望及生存，反在岌岌可危之中。蘇聯指責土國取得某某外國之同意，在海峽採取種種軍事措置，此說絕無根據。要之，土國接受參加修約談判，證明吾人具有誠意，此項談判業已準備就緒，隨時可以舉行云。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社安加拉廿一日電〕土耳其答復蘇聯之照會，語氣冷酷其堅決拒絕蘇聯全部要求，殆無疑義，蘇士兩國已無單獨談判餘地。至於土國建議之修正蒙德婁公的三點，均爲技術問題，無關宏旨。政治觀察家認爲今後時局發展，不外三種途徑，即（一）海峽問題無形擱置；（二）蘇聯撤回要求，同時國際會議順利召開；（三）蘇聯對土耳其出以武力解決。要之局勢無論如何演變土國已採取最後態度，此項態度殆獲英美之同意。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社土耳其京城廿日電〕關於韃靼尼爾海峽問題。頃據土國外交問題糊威歐里姆敎授在某報發表一文加以評論稱，土蘇兩國互相交換照會，不啻兩國直接進行談判，但欲使此項談判與荣特婁公的趨於一致，則殊非易事。蘇聯如堅持其要求，則召集蒙特婁公約簽字各國舉行會議，最爲可取云。此間外交界人士則認爲，英國或將發起此項會議，但土耳其本身不致採取此種行動，無論如何土國將由其他國家召開此項會議。</p>

<p>— 黃嘉謨</p>
<p>必須身心　敏方能勝任愉快</p>
<p>扒竊黨爲了「人才輩出」，其扒錢的法門頗多，其中最有出息的一帮稱爲『喫　飯』，這是我們市民直接受禍的各種技倆的總稱。今先將「喫　飯」一帮的組織與活動方式　述如下；其　各帮俟後叙及。「喫　飯」爲帮中切口，即是「喫不正當的飯」之謂。其活動路綫雖多，一言以蔽之，不外「竊　欺詐」四字而已。那些「落草」於「吃　飯」的老弟兄，都是身而齊整，衣冠整潔之流，此帮旣　做非法的勾當，最易失風被捕。故須是身手　便，耳目乖覺的方能勝任愉快，帮中切口稱爲「玲瓏子舞耀」。</p>
<p>從事於「吃壞飯」者，都須拜師入帮，師即各該地段之「爺叔班子」是。爺　的地位有如戲班中的導演，須有「量材錄用」的眼力。決定之後，便支配他們學習各種扒竊的專門技術，分門別類，有如入大學之選修科。一俟學成畢業，方才可以出而「應世」。</p>
<p>在「吃壞飯」帮中最有出息的勾當，便是「硬扒」，「硬扒」乃是强力搶奪之謂。此中弟兄黨羽人數最多，而分佈的地區也最　關。自歐風東漸，都市中的女性出門必挾皮包，「硬扒」弟兄便以擔奪這種手皮包爲最得意傑作。他們以二三人爲一小組，須先觀着形勢然後下手，　路奪得之後，便移交給黨羽狂奔而入黑弄，轉瞬已不見人。若在黑夜僻路，弱女子無從反抗，更加易於下手。但若鬧市中警力充　，或是路人衆多之　。他們便不敢冒昧從事了，但多年來此風已不盛行了，因爲許多女性都是盧有其表，皮包內藏鈔極爲有限，即使賣掉了舊皮包也听値無幾。因此他們便轉移目光到各種女飾上頭去。原來「硬扒」帮對於金飾　　都有鑒別力，所以決不致搶到了假金具。他們給金飾定下了下列的切口：</p>
<p>原名</p>
<p>切口</p>
<p>金鐲　銬子</p>
<p>挖耳　蒜</p>
<p>耳環　蓬</p>
<p>簪　閂</p>
<p>手錶　弗定心</p>
<p>鑲鑽　加洒花</p>
<p>原名</p>
<p>切口</p>
<p>錢袋　皮子</p>
<p>搶「帽」　捉烏龜拋頂宮</p>
<p>搶「耳環」　扯篷</p>
<p>搶「手鐲」　捋苗</p>
<p>搶「金戒」　捋手環</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕京滬區鐵路材料處舞弊案，經地院二次審訊辯論終結，定廿四日上午宣判，路局復於昨日再函地院，詳細脂列全案經過，提供參考。茲探錄原文如下；逕啓者，敝局材料處貪汚一案，前經貴院於本年九月二十日第一次庭訊後，因被吿等措詞虛妄，多非事實，曾於十月二日將關於材料處用人及査辦貪汚案件之經渦情形，函請登照在案，嗣於本月十七日，經貴院二次庭訊，敝局重行派員旁聽，將被告等供詞，當塲記錄，査各重要人犯，供詞翻覆，且多失實，爰再向貴院補充聲明，以供裁量，茲分述於後：</p>
<p>關於張鴻圖部分</p>
<p>（甲）張鴻圖此次庭供，重複涉及張伯康之來歷，及與彼之關係，査張鴻岡及張伯康在任職本局以前，同係交通部材料司職員，在去年本人奉命接收京滬區前，均與之素昧平生，張伯康由部派爲接收隨員，張鴻岡由部派爲材料處長，而張伯康之被派爲採購課長，則由張鴻岡所呈請，由此可知張鴻岡所稱張伯康係本人帶來，非彼之私人，殊非事實，至於撤換張伯康一節，本人於四月間，因風聞局內外對於材料處有閒話，故曾決意更換，並屢託政界有地位之公正人士，如沈怡尹仲容張茲關等推　繼任人選，當案情未發時，曾將此意吿知張鴻圖，彼旣知本人泱心換張伯康，則不久又另蔗他人，以期掩議，而此時張鴻岡之不法，已有風聞，故對所蘆之人，當然不加考慮，其經過詳情，且詳於十月二日致貴院之公函，足徵張鴻岡自稱建議換人，而本人不肯出此者，顯係曲解事實之談。</p>
<p>（乙）張鴻岡又供稱：「上次我說的口供（指第一次庭訊口供）與今天完全不同，我要推翻二次的口供，關於路局的口供，完全不對，陳局長把我口供改了，這點陳局長應當負責」査張鴻岡第一次庭訊，由貴審判長親自公開訊問，其爲出於自由意旨之陳述，皎若日星，尙敢藉詞推翻，其供詞之翻覆，於此可見。按張在路局受訊時，訊問者爲警務處長王兆槐，紀錄者爲文書課課長梁湛，同樣爲自由之陳述，貴院如欲求當時訊問經過，可傳王梁二員至庭詢問，惟在張鴻岡意中，庭訊筆錄，尙可推翻，則路局訊問筆錄，更可任意否認，此非本人之欲改變其供詞，實其自欲改變之耳。張鴻圖如說實話，則其言應始終如一，惟其意圖狡賴，說盡謊語，則無論如何刻意求工終有缺漏，此所謂欲蓋彌彰。　（丙）張鴻岡關於其犯罪行爲，槪不承認或諉過於其妻郁香巖，而實際上張郁爲夫婦關係，晨夕相共，其始作弊也，由張鴻岡將訂購單故意積壓，乃由朱必聞示意張開源，再由張開源知照張伯康，須與處長太太合作，朱必聞爲郁香巖之私人，而張鴻圖任用之，以爲穿針引錢之工具，張鴻岡豈有不知，此其一也。材料處職員如張伯康輩日夕出人於其家門，與郁香巖廝混極熟，張鴻岡耳目所及，豈無聞知，其所以有時故意規避，方與郁狼狽爲奸，掩人耳目，此其二也。張鴻圖自稱知悉郁香巖有錢，又稱渠與郁香巖之錢，從何而來，張何以不問，如謂經商，則又不能指出何種商業及經過詳情，足見其所經營者，即材料處舞弊而已，此其三也。夫妻間之一造，偶一犯罪，而隱蔽有方，非對造所能知悉者，亦非無其例，惟舞弊歷半年餘之久，財產驟然增益，部下往還甚密，而其所犯之非，又與其主管之事務有關，再加以共犯不利於己之證言，爲張伯康朱必聞等之供詞，張鴻岡之犯行證據確鋻，毫無一疑義。</p>
<p>關於郁香巖部份</p>
<p>（甲）郁香巖自案發後，即潛逃無蹤，經本人親　警務處處長王兆槐等於六月廿五日深夜四時，親往張鴻圖所指之偉光醫院等找，次日王兆槐處長按照張鴻圖所供之另一地點朱榮聖家，於半夜二時前往投等，均無着落，然後一而將張鴻圖等備文解送貴院，一面行文淞滬警備司令部請協緝郁香巖歸案，即張鴻圖自已亦供陳伯莊扣押我，要我交出郁香巖來，足徵本人追緝郁香巖，不爲不力，其經過詳情，具見七月十日本局致檢察處一函，而郁香嚴所稱：三次會見本人之說，自然全麗子虛。至於郁香巖之犯行，旣有張伯康等之供詞可證，其收受贓款二千四百萬元，其他被吿均已供證明確，郁氏何能獨自抵賴，况朱必聞確爲郁氏心腹，而最初示意張伯康與之合作者，即爲朱必聞，朱亦供稱郁香巖以購取鋼琴爲由借端推動舞弊，至爲顯明，至於郁香嚴信口亂咬，以求一　，初則厚經本人，以本人主張澈査此案也。繼　張雲鶴，以雲鶴爲蹬人也。進而歷辱檢察官，以其代表國家提起公訴也。終且侮辱整個司法之尊嚴，其誣愈多，其罪彌著，以郁氏之緊行不端，無所不爲，宜其膽大妄爲，犯罪以後，猶不自懺悔，斯人與張鴻岡，若不受國法嚴懲，則綱紀無存，吏治澄淸，尙復何望。</p>
<p>關於張伯康部份</p>
<p>張伯康之辯獲律師，代具辯稱：「如稱張伯康與商人勾結收取佣金，那麽這佣金，在路局方面亦加承認，否則如何路局於案發後，再至商家强收錢，硬湊成佣金的數目」，查本案被吿等與商人勾結收取佣金，在商業上普通交易，或有所謂佣金之智尙，而身爲公務員，受公家俸給，應潔身自好，不應於主管或監督之事務間接戰直接圖利，如有圖利情事，無論商樂上有何名目，於法即爲貪汚。本局之所以對木案加以澈查送院究辦，正以不承認佣金制應存在於公務機關，且佣金之來源，非售貨商人能自掏腰包，捨身以飼虎，實於原來賣價加成出賣，俗諺所謂羊毛出在羊身上是也。是以犯員所得之利益，即公家之損失，而於商家旣收貨款，未曾扣還此不法利益，以交與犯員之前，在判處罪刑之商家是謂贓款，在未判處罪刑之商家，是謂不當得利，本局自得依法收回，是以曾派路警，押同經手犯員前往商家吊取贓款，若指此爲本局承認佣金因此可以解免被吿等之罪責，邏輯上與法律上均不容有如斯之曲解，綜上三點，相應函達，敬希登照爲荷，此致上海地方法院刑庭。</p>

<p>（一）腎結石症</p>
<p>吳詢問　鄙人於四月初旬，右腰間突然作痛甚烈，即請醫師注射止痛藥及匹尼西林二針，乃漸覺平靜，不數星期又覺該處慶痛，疑爲腎病，乃至某醫院騐小便，結果有膿細胞，紅血球，及蛋白質少許，一月餘前，小便內曾排出石子一粒，大的爲腎石，鄙人先後服　Helmitol　六七支，及注射匹尼西林一百二十萬單位又未見效，最近鄙友某醫師命服Sulfamerazine　六十片，又謂該病爲腎盂炎，Pyelitis（由於扁桃腺發炎而起）未知Sulfamerazine功效如何？反應如何？又對於此病解釋如何？有何積極醫治辦法？尙祈答覆。</p>
<p>〔醫學博士唐仁縉答〕該病或係腎結石而引起之腎盂炎，Sulfamerazine之功效，爲消炎滅菌劑，反應有時能刺激胃壁粘膜，引起食慾不振及惡心等胃症狀，宜多服利尿劑及水份，積極療法可請泌尿科專家行腎盂洗滌法，或能奏效。</p>

<p>〔翳學博士唐仁縉答〕鼻卹並無特效藥，應檢査有無全身疾病，（如令郞之年齡，應檢查大便有無寄生蟲），而加以治療，局部出血可由鼻科專家行藥物腐蝕法或電氣燒灼法，常奏良效。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日下午三時，吳市長召集棉紡染織及複製工業，商討抑平紗布具體辦法，到有六區棉紡工業染織工業針織業毛巾被毯業紗業棉布手帕等粟各負責人，首由市長致詞，略謂上次會議所決定，各公會應將生產設備，生產數量，所需原料數量，以及上月份產銷實况等報會，各公會迄今尙未能完全遵辦，對於有貨銷數等項，均未能切實塡報，以致稽核配售，統感困難，以後希各公會，須與政府通力合作，切實辦理，庶可核定合理平抑價格云。</p>
<p>王啓宇謂，紗布之價格上漲，實由於供不敷求，外埠實銷甚湧，而尤以廣州紗價二十支竟高達三百八九十萬元，蕪湖等埠亦高至二百八十餘萬元，再以原料價昂，廠商應用美棉，外匯請求不易，同時電力供應不足，未能儘量生產，至紗號業配紗間題，因紗號商幷非販買商，實爲外埠複製工廠之代理人，所以配紗亦應同樣配給。</p>
<p>束雲章云，（一）對於今後配貨，仍照前定民營六成紡建四成例，再試辦一次，（二）政府對於採購美棉，應大量供給外匯，國產棉花不足，則唯有向外採購。</p>
<p>吳市長最後決定，（一）紗布因供求及各種關係，目前尙難適合，但終須以合理方法配銷，以遏黑市，（二）結匯偽購棉，常請示行政院，轉飭中央銀行辦理，（三）電力供應，前次商定，在用戶電力核減，現已徵得市參議會同意，不久即可實施，（四）發展南洋紗布市塲，以爭取外匯，（五）至束經理所云最近再試配一次，按照各公會所報每月需用紗量，爲二六，〇五五件，決定先配一〇，五二九件，以應各廠急需。（六）配價以原料工繳，再加合法利潤及準備費爲標準，（七）配紗方面，改爲由各同業公會按照各廠實際需要　實支配，（八）各公會對配發之紗，應將製成品，數量，成本，及銷售客戶，詳實具報，以便稽核，繼由李副主委補充吳市長決定辦法之意見云，各同業公會（一）應組研究原料需要數量小組會，以便統計谷該業廠商目下實需原料確數，（二）應組評價小組會，以原料工繳及合法利潤以評定製成品廠銷價格，（三）應組配售小組會，以監督各廠商製成品實銷情形。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕中紡公司張副處長似旅公畢返滬，記者詢以在京與英國紡織業代表洽商經過。答稱：在紡織工具方面，曾與英代表懇切說明我國之目標爲恢復戰前五百萬錠之數字，此僅爲補充損失，談不到擴充；希望英國對此點能深切瞭解，而在購置紡織機時予我以優先權。因目前英國一方面須顧到本身之需要，同時須輸出紡機至債權國，我國在英訂購機器，並非易事。此項折衝費時最多，卒得英代表之同情，而獲圓滿之結果。在原料方面，因澳洲羊毛幾全部輸英，我國要求能分配一部份。近傳澚洲將輸出大量羊毛至日本，以復興日本之毛織業。特詢之英代表，知並非事實。至於英國之紡織業，今日正在實施現代化之過程中，惟以大部份工廠成立過久，設施較舊，福利較差，一般英國工人不願入紡織廠工作，實爲英棉紡業發展之大障碍。</p>
<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦廿一日電〕爲恢復英國在世界紡織機上之領導地位計，英國目前正有一項重要新發展。英國所有大棉紗廠，已回意及早設立一永久性硏究機構，以檢討並評較最新各種機器生產方法與棉織品。蘭卡郡波爾頓附近一新機器廠，已用新法生產紡紗　，其速度較舊法快一倍半。此項工業爲英國歷史最悠久之工業之一。於十六世紀成立，十八世紀趨現代化，但至二十世紀其新紡織機，較國外新工業所有設備爲陳舊，因而英國政府遂任命一工作隊，該隊於本年五月份之報吿書中，會强調以現代式機械代替現有之設備，現英國所出產之紡織機中正運往外國者竟佔總數之百分之七十五。</p>

<h3 id="c167">提倡國貨與促進生產 <a href="#c167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— 毛慶祥</p>
<p>從八年堅苦抗戰中我們每一個中國人都能得到這樣一個敎訓，即是我們中國今後要想立國於世界，不再受外來的侵略，非積極完成國家現代化的工作不可。而要完成現代化的國家建設，在政治上須要民主統一，在經濟上須要促進生產，兩者缺一，現代化的新中國便建設不起來。</p>
<p>目前全中國的人民，都要求政治上的統一與民主，但對於經濟建設方面，却多少有點被忽視了。大家祗知道物價的騰貴，生產的萎縮，外貨的傾銷，使國計民生，陷於極端痛苦，極端危急的絕境，却不知物價騰貴，生產萎縮，外貨傾銷的主因，就在於我們的生產太落後！由於生產的落後，我們的生產品成本高昂，物價怎麼不要騰貴？物價騰貴了以後人民的購買力削弱，生產又怎麼不萎縮？生產萎縮了，有許多貨物供不應求，外國貨又怎麽不會乘機來傾銷？所以今日我們中國民生的困苦，根本的原因是生產落後，生產因落後招致來了外貨的傾銷，外貨的傾銷，自然又招致來了國計民生頻於破產。因此我們要挽救當前國家與人民的經濟危機，政治上的統一與民主固極重要，促進生產，完成現代化的生產建設，也同樣的重要。</p>
<p>中國生產促進會的任務，就在於協助生產者改良生產，並爲陷於困境的生產者解決當前困難，使幼稚的中國工業，獲得發展的機會，使整個國家的經濟建設，一步步踏上現代化之路。因爲我們曉得唯有如此，方能根本挽救中國的經濟危機，方能根本消滅中國人民的貧窮與痛苦。</p>
<p>所以促進生產，是解救已瀕絕境的國計民生之百年大計，也是最根本的一個方法。不過這一根本方法之推進與完成，決不是一朝一夕間事。可是環顧當前我國生產凋敝的現狀，誰也知道在治本之外，必須同時治標，方能挽救擺在我們每個人面前這種緊急的局勢，治標之道，自狀又舍提倡國貨莫屬。假使在目前情况之下，我們貧困的中國同胞再不瞭解工業破產，生產停滯的嚴重性，不肯忍受暫時的痛苦去提倡國貨，等到我們中國自身的生產事榮趨於澈底崩潰，那時候的痛苦，恐怕還不止物價高漲這一端。</p>
<p>也許有人早已懷疑提倡國貨這一運動的實際功效，因爲我們中國近二十餘年來，幾乎每年都有提倡國貨的運動，可是直到現在，國貨始終沒有被提倡成功。這中間的原因一方面是因爲八年抗戰，國貨生產事業爲戰爭所破壞，現在又得從頭做起，另一方面是提倡了國貨之後，必須繼之以促進生產，倘然只知提倡國貨而不知促進生產，國貨的生產事業故步自封，不能向前　進，從改良出品，减低成本……諸方面去求進步，則提倡國貨的結果不免於仍等於零。過去提倡國貨運動的缺點不能不說就在這裏，所以我們今天的提倡國貨，舉辦國貨展覽商塲，決不是單純地爲國貨廠商找銷路，而是要以提倡國貨作爲促進生產，建設現代工業的一種手段。這是挽救國計民生的一個基本方策，也是建設現代國家的一個重要步驟。</p>
<h3 id="c168">國貨展覽與提倡國貨運動 <a href="#c168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— 楊蔭溥</p>
<p>我們提出了「提倡國貨」的口號，到現在至少已有四十多年的歷史。四十多年前的往日，我們開始提倡國貨運動，到四十多年後的今日，我們還在繼續着這個運動，並且似乎於實際上並沒有多大進步，國貨的危機，祗見其日趨嚴重。國貨之應加提倡，站在國民立塲上，自然是分所當爲的事。不過我們過去所謂提倡，着重在消　大衆方面，含有由大家來輔助護披的意義。國貨雖然並不比外貨品質來得好些，價錢來得便宜些，做國民的應當本着提倡國貨的意義，抱着犧牲的精神，不用外貨，仍用國貨。</p>
<p>這種需要大家犧牲來提倡國貨的運動，有兩個最大的缺點：第一，不易普遍；第二，不能持久。因爲要買好貨，要買便宜貨，是一般民衆極自然的願望。國貨不一定最好，最便宜，而我們需要犧牲着去買他，用他無論如何，不會眞眞得到全體民衆的合作，所以說，這種運動，不會普遍，就是我們退一步說，大衆眞能抱着犧牲精神來提倡國貨，但是生產界可望於民衆的道種輔助，至多也祗是暫時的。工業在初期幼稚的時代，需要人民幫忙，人民是能諒解能同情的；然而經過了相當時期的幫忙，而仍蛋不能如期逐漸長成，人民的愛護情緒，就不易繼續維持。所以說，這種運動，不能持久。</p>
<p>過去提倡國貨運動的錯誤，是在專着重於消費大衆方面，而忽略了生產界本身。好像民衆個個應當抱着提倡國貨的精神去購用國貨，而生產界却並不需要抱着提倡國貨的精神去生產國貨。民衆永遠是推動這個運動的主體，是一個主動者；國貨界永遠是一個被推動的對像，是一個被動者</p>
<p>這次本埠國貨展覽商塲的成立，不能不說是生產界爭取主動的一個重要步驟。等待着顧客自己上門來，從商店立塲講，是被動的；現在計劃周詳，集中展覽，有着使顧客不得不來的作用，顧客却成爲被動，商塲已獲得主動。所以說，生產界這項舉動，是爭取主動的一個重要步驟。但是有了國貨，才能展覽，這種辦法，獲得了國貨推銷方面的主動，還不能不在另一方面－也是更基本一方面－同時下手。這另一方面，就是國貨的生產。</p>
<p>所以，乘着現在這個含有主動作用的國貨展覽機會，我們應當推動一個生產界提倡國貨運動。要知道生產界能抱着提倡國貨的精神去生產國貨，才能逐漸爭取到主動地位。</p>
<p>在過去由大衆來提倡國貨的情緒底下，一部份生產界無形中養成了一種依賴心理，似乎總覺得成敗是握在他人手裏；無形中形成了一種自卑心理，似乎總覺得自己基礎太薄弱，萬不能同外貨來競爭。過去吾國生產界因陋就簡的設備，祗圖近利的政策，不能不說多少受了這種心理的影響。</p>
<p>這種心理上的錯覺，應當立刻加以更正。生產國貨，不僅是爲圖個人近利，是負有提倡國貨使命的。也就是說，要逐漸建立起國貨地位，使外貨無從插足，才是眞眞的提倡國貨。這個目的，單單從民衆方面來用功夫，就是完全成功，也至多祗做到了一半。其他一半，也是更重要的一半，是應當生產界本身負起來的。生產界應當充分培養獨立奮鬥精神，要知道依賴民衆的提倡，是靠不住的；應當有充分的自信信念，要知道只要自己能努力，只要自己努力的方向不錯，國貨的地位一定能建立起來，與外貨競爭，是不成問題的。</p>
<p>生產界努力的最後目標，自然是能有「價廉物美」的出品。就是不能價比人家廉，物比人家美，亦得價同人家一樣廉，物同人家一樣美。萬不得已再退一步，亦至少要價比人家貴得不多，物比人家差得不多。這樣再配合着含有主動意義的展覽式推銷，配合着民衆的提倡情緒，國貨的地位，自然就能鞏固起來。</p>
<p>生產界要達到出品「價廉物美」的目標，自然有應取的方向。目下生產受着環境上種種的限制，要立刻向着正常的途徑發展，自然千萬頭緒，會遇到不少的困難。不過，由我們看來，不管是機械設備問題，原料問題，技術間題，動力問題，工人問題等等，雖在目前每個都是難題，統還有解決的辦法。恐怕最不易解決，也最需要解決的基本問題，還是管理及人事問題。要出品精良，要减輕成本，恐怕非從管理及人事兩方面，加以澈底改革不可。缺乏組織能力，一向是我們各方面各部門最大的缺點，生產界也不能例外。總得要管理科學化，人事能合理化之後，我們的生產界才有光明的前途，我們國貨才有眞眞的出路。</p>
<p>所以，在國貨展覽已經在本埠實現的今日，我們希望生產界能更進一步，放遠眼光，在生產效能上來表現出他們提倡國貨的精神。（民國卅五年十月十八日）</p>

<p>— 延娟</p>
<p>結婚有益</p>
<p>結婚對於人生，是一件極重大的事，而且是極適合於自然條件，這只要一看結婚者和未婚者的健康情形的差異，就可以充分證明。</p>
<p>根據統計，有配偶的人，特別是男性，比同等年齡的釆婚者，其死亡率要低得多，這證明結婚是有益於健康的·但其原因爲何？則因男女而有別。</p>
<p>以女性言，結婚以後，她的遭遇，終沒有像未婚者那樣的突兀，她可以從激烈的生存競爭中，解脫出來，心身方面，都較爲安定平易。其他方面，女性發育到成熟以後，就需要順應自然的盡生殖的天職，如果不營生殖，則對健康上反有不利。</p>
<p>以男性言，家庭可使他恢復疲勞，良妻可予他安息慰勞，道種效力，比靈藥更大。沒有配偶的人，就得不到這種安慰，乾燥無味的家庭，使他疲勞的身心，更加疲勞而已。未婚的男子往往深夜不眠，借酒消愁，於是染患神經病或性病的機會很多，有害健康，實非淺鮮。</p>
<p>夫婦年齡</p>
<p>結婚這件事，男女雙方的心身健全是第一條件，所以年齡不能相差太大。目前有人實行早婚，固不大妥當，有的年老的男子，娶了妙齡的女子；也有半老的婦人，愛上年靑的男子，這種情形，更不好。因爲老年的人娶了年輕的妻妾，不得不設法獲伊歡心，因而硬裝精力充沛，其結果必勞力過度，促成早衰，影響健康，無以復加。在年靑的妻妾方面言，她雖不致受害，但結果必因性的不滿足，而發生種種問題。年老的締女和年靑的男子之間，其結果也是一樣。所以夫婦的年齡，如果二人相距太遠，則家庭容易發生破綻，這不僅是性生活的破綻，更會發生健康的破綻，生命的破綻。</p>
<p>男女雙方的身心成熟以後，才可以結婚，成熟的年齡，大概男子是廿五歲到古十歲，女子是二十歲到二十五歲。在這段時間內結婚，自然很得當，不過在目前的社會狀態下，因經濟條件的限制，男子多在三十歲前後結婚，但女子如果到了三十歲，身體的組織開始變硬，分娩也較困難，所以不能結婚得太遲，最好能在二十三，四歲左右·至於夫婦年齡的相差，大致在三歲至十歲，超過得太多，也不好的。</p>
<p>初夜的注意</p>
<p>結婚的當夜，性行爲應該非常愼重。舊式的結婚，「入床」的事認爲很重大的。媒人的責任，要過了道一夜方可解除。結婚的人，一般的都在豫想着初夜的情形，新娘方面，雖竭力進免在經期結婚，但也有種種例外的事發生，譬如月經突然來潮了，或發生其他不順利的事。所以初次如果急於性行爲，有時使新娘發生恐怖心，或因出血而受驚，在這種情形下，不快，反感，恐怖的陰影，會殘留下來，而成爲不感症的原因。</p>
<p>至於婚後的新婚旅行，也値得考慮。因爲新婚的人，身心容易過度疲勞，精神也一定不大安定，如果再加上舟車之勞，旅宿的煩，神經不能安靜，於健康之道頗不相宜。</p>

<p>— 余人鳳</p>
<p>世界由母系時代轉變到了父系時代，迄今已逾數千年之久。在這個悠長的期間，婦女們是被封鎖在黑暗的監獄—家庭—裏面，過着極慘痛的牛馬生活。迨到資本主義應社會的需要產生以後，少數的婦女才慢慢的由禁錮中解放出來。但這決不是婦女的時遝亨通，有它的經濟原因。但是細一考察和檢討，婦女們現在是吾眞正的被解放了，是否整個的婦女界都已過去了監獄式的家庭？事實吿訴我們，資本主義發展的結果，使得她們不得不把家庭的工作作爲决要，而跑到工廠裏去作工，但仍不能脫離家庭瑣事和煩惱，而且更受盡了廠主資本家的壓迫與剝削。其痛苦之情形，誠非筆墨所能形容。固然，尙有一部份受國智識的婦女，已經脫離了那種覊絆，但是她們往往是機關的花瓶，地主資本家的玩物，若說眞獲得作人的地位的，在婦女界，實祗有少數的少數。</p>
<p>婦女既受蕭重重的壓迫，所以社會上到處是她們苦痛呻吟的現象。尤其在封建禮敎下的中國，制服在三從四德的範圍裏面，過着奴隸式的日子。同時因知識自封，根本不能給予她們利害的感覺和認識，祗知道怨天允命。舉若報紙上時常出現其婦人的服毒，其少女的自殺……等等的慘痛新聞，十九總離不了環境的所逼迫。什麼提倡自由平等，那根本就是一宗極難實現的運動。雖然目今的城市，多有締女會的組織，卻半是徒獵虛名，不務實際的招牌。</p>
<p>婦女會的組織，誰都知道這是她們的團體，要求社會上的地位與力量。但事實上，却操縱在都市裏所謂摩登的貴婦人闊小姐或一部分智識階級的女士手中。固然，這些熱心的（？）婦女，抱負了絕大的解放目的和責任，而結果却很難有眞正的價値。因爲婦女解放，根本不是單靠少數上層婦女形式上的吶喊和做作。換名話說，就是必須所有的婦女全得着相當的教育才行。</p>
<p>中國婦女，既未解放，那麼不祗是要求地位平等，幷且應當提前擔負起整個國家財富興衰上的責任，也就是得改變本身的奢華觀念。現在中國化裝品的驚人輸入，金錢外溢堪慮，該是婦女們的責任，這決不是好聽的口號所能掩飾。又如職業運動，與其希望城市婦女會的中堅份子，智識階級實行，倒不如降格的宣傳到農村裏去。憑良心說，我們也可以觀摩她們那種樸實的生活，而減去自己都市裏的幾分洋氣。要知常擦脂粉，決不就是一解放，戴巴黎帽，穿高跟鞋，穿高跟鞋也並不是平等的表演呢。</p>

<p>下面所例各點，並非毫無根據的傳說，乃經美國醫藥學會切實證明的事實：</p>
<p>（一）戰時所產男嬰與女嬰之比，往往比平時爲高。對的。每次戰爭中所生男嬰與女嬰之比例，皆在一百十五比一百以上。</p>
<p>（二）健壯的產婦，往住產男孩。不對。父母的個性，對於嬰孩的性別，並無明顯的影響。</p>
<p>（三）締女之懷孕與否，能在最初十天中測知。對的。利用安仲氏（Aschhein-Zondek）試騐法，便能肯定的測知婦女的懷孕與吾。因爲懷孕婦女的排泄液體中，含有大量的涎腺荷爾蒙。把這些荷爾蒙注射於老鼠身上，其卵細胞便成熟得特別快。由於外科術的解剖試騐老鼠的卵巢，婦女的受孕與否，便可測知。</p>
<p>（四）齡過低或過高的締女，生產時是非常危險的。對的。大的年在二十以下或三十五以上的婦女生產時，其嬰孩與母親死亡率比較高。在二十與三十五之間時，比較安全。</p>
<p>（五）剛生的男嬰常比女嬰嬌弱，其死亡率也較高。□對的。在第一年中，男嬰的死亡數的超出女嬰五分之一。</p>
<p>（六）嬰孩的大小，以產婦在姙娠期所食食糧的多寡而定。不對。最近醫學界的意見，以爲母親的食量，並不直接影響嬰孩出生時的大小。</p>
<p>（七）生產男嬰時，較生產女嬰爲困難。對的。男嬰孩常比女嬰孩大，所以較難生產，但並非因爲性別的關係。</p>
<p>（八）姙娠期婦女，應當吃兩人的食糧。　不對。吃得太多會增加重量，身體過重便易患血毒症。</p>
<p>（九）婚後的不孕症，大半能治愈。對的。近年來醫華界對不孕症的治療，很有進步。</p>
<p>（十）男性患不孕症者，較女性爲少。對的。男性患不孕症者，的佔全數的百分之三十至五十。</p>
<p>（十一）墮胎雖不合法，但較生產爲安全。不對。墮胎的死亡率，超出正常生產十倍以上。</p>
<p>（十二）年紀較大的婦女，比年靑婦女容易產雙生兒。對的。產雙生兒最多的機曾，是年紀在三十五以上的婦女。白皮膚女子產雙生兒的機會，又比褐皮膚的女子爲多。</p>
<p>（十三）嬰孩之性別，在受孕時決定。對的。男性精蟲有兩種，一種生男孩，一種生女孩。嬰孩性別之決定，全視何種精蟲與卵子結合而定。</p>
<p>（十四）壯年夫締所生嬰孩，常比靑年夫婦所生者聰明。不對。嬰孩在父母處所得之影饗，是在產後，並非「胎敎」。</p>
<p>（十五）一年生一個嬰孩，較數年生一個嬰孩易於養成。不對。當兩要生產時期相隔兩年以下時，其死亡率等於數年生一孩時的一倍半。</p>

<h3 id="c174">關於玩具 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 周煦良</p>
<p>旅川雜憶之一</p>
<p>離舊歷新年還有一個多月，成都市上已到處看得見大孩的玩具了。有些是挑着擔子在街上賣，有些是在店門口陳列着。——那些店，平時不知是做什麼生意的，現在都一變而成爲專賣玩具的店了。價錢很便宜，風車，　鼓，括括兒，只賣二百錢，還不到一分法幣，鬼臉壳六百錢八百錢也賣了。小刀，小槍，喇叭，洋鼓，我雖沒有買過，想來也不會貴；那個有獃勁的，花上半塊錢，就可以裝一布袋，到有小孩的親友家中去扮一次聖誕老人，騙許多歡心。做父母的，帶着自己孩子在街上走，看見這些，也可以毫不遲疑的掏出錢買一兩樣給孩子們滿足，這在大人簡直說不上是花費，然而孩子們得到了這些，我敢說，和得到小汽車或洋囡囡的喜悅並沒有兩樣。</p>
<p>我曾經走過好些城市；像成都這樣的。玩具多，而且便宜，而且上市得早，還沒有見過。在這一點上，成都的兒童是幸福的。在別處，許多東西，孩子平時也可以玩的，總要等到年尾才大量出現，而且價錢也總不會賣到不値錢的地步。在稍大的都市裏，舶來的玩具，東洋貨或是西洋貨，標的價錢更是嚇人。多少次，多少個父母站在大公司玻璃櫃台前沉吟着——一面孩子在身邊鬧着要，一面自己計算着，差不多等於做複雜的數學問題一樣，怎樣從柴米油鹽，和應酬，和自己的娛樂種種用途中騰出這一筆花費！我自己也在這些玻璃櫃台前徘徊過——雖則我那時還沒有做父親，也沒有結婚——我徘徊着，比這個價錢，比那個便錢，同時又得想，到底是皮球，還是火車，還是小機關槍最登樣，最給小孩子喜悅？使人氣惱而又好笑的是，在那些有大公司的城市裏，只有這些東洋貨或西洋貨才稱得上玩具，或者至少是，送小孩子的禮品。如果你給親友的孩子一個紙球或一個叢鼓，那就等於給孩子一粒花生米；孩子的父母不但會不感謝，也許還以爲你蔑視他們孩子和他們自己。結果呢，倒霉的是孩子們自家；他們得到的玩具，比他們應得到，可能得到的，少好多。應酬到孩子身上本是不必要的事；應酬得難討好，那乾脆還是不應酬的好。</p>
<p>這錯誤是，我想來，那班做父母的太以自己的心和成人的心去武斷他們的孩于了。我們總是要我們自己喜歡的東西才買給孩子，才以爲孩子會喜歡。我們買給小孩的東洋貨或西洋貨往往是我們自己要玩的。我們看見小汽車在桌上跑，一到桌子邊就轉灣，自己看了高興，就買了給孩子；我們看見洋囡囡的衣服做的好看，像影戲中嘉年會的女郎，我們覺得美，我們就買來給孩子。懂得買主心理的東洋貨或西洋貨玩具的老板因此想空了心思造出些可以使大人開心的玩具來騙他們買；有發明頭腦的科學人材和有想象的藝術人材都被僱來參加這瑣細的創造，做出些奇七異珍，冀以引起我們的科學的驚奇和藝術的喜悅。然而替孩子們想，這全是耗費。孩子們得到這些玩具將如猪八戒吃下人參果，決不會細嚼。儘管你說這裏面含有科學咸藝術的金苗，他們看來也仍是一塊頑鐵；過不了兩天工夫，小汽車同　或一樣拆個散，洋囡囡則是同鬼臉壳一起丟在屋角落積灰。</p>
<p>我們總不會忘記玩具只是玩具，不能是科學，也不能是藝術。一個有探奇性的孩子自動地會整天鑽在他的小汽車裏，如同鑽在他週　上下的自然現象裏一樣，找尋科學；一個有審美心的孩子也會很自然地靜靜的面對着他的洋娃娃和落日和月明之夜，鑑賞美。這些是異常的　　，我們不否認他們有；但是　　的兒童的活動都不純粹的是知或純粹的是賞。他們因爲他們不能像成人那樣去玩科學玩藝術，所以要玩玩具，是因爲他們要玩；那些玩具祇是帮他們玩。在這一點上，一塊方木帮的並不一定少，一個走到桌子邊不落下的汽車帮的也不一定多。孩子有他們自己的世界—玩的世界；他們要求於玩具的祇是給這縹渺的世界一點可觸換的實在性，一個支點。所以有玩具就够了，什麼樣的玩具倒犯不着我們操心。</p>
<p>孩子們本來最富於生命的。他們祇是不能挨餓，像魚翅，海參，燕窩一類的補劑並不需要。那些住在大都市的兒童是希臘神話中的談泰露司，眼看着鮮美的葡萄，吃不到嘴。成都的兒童沒有那麼多誘惑，但他們却能得到自己的靑菜淡飯。容易壞，也容易做，容易買，這些挑在成都街市上賣的土製玩具，只有它是眞正屬於孩子的。幾千年來，它們曾經以鮮明的大紅深綠明藍，單純而明朗的聲音，簡單的設計，取悅過我們的祖先；在現在或將來，也將一樣取悅我們的兒孫。有如年年的春草，可是不等到春天到來，便長遍成都和孩子的門庭。</p>

<h3 id="c176">悲喜談 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 叔孫如瑩</p>
<p>悲喜是人之常情，强求之不可得，强抑之亦不可能，由於悲的情緒的過分發展，便達於悲觀的境地，由於喜的情緒的極度發揚，便達於樂觀的界域。悲觀固然不應該，而樂觀到亳無條件，毫無保留，也不是一個好的現象。雖然，任何人都不免稍有樂觀或悲觀的傾向，但這傾向茍不太偏激，亦大可順其自然之勢，不必故意加以誘導或阻抑。</p>
<p>如果不幸而有至親摯友之喪，號啕痛哭三天，也不爲過；如果千里他鄕遇故知，握手言歡，縱然大笑三十分鐘，也不失爲倜儻豪情。太上忘情，本非常人所能爲，但對情惑能有適度的調節，擒縱自如，亦實爲現代人必具之修養。悲而不喪志，喜而不忘形，則這悲這喜，亦爲無害於人，且有裨益於身心。</p>
<p>不論是悲還是喜，只要是正常的情緒的　洩，對於人不但是無害有益的，而且往往還是必要的。就心理健康言，情緒的激動，本與人體內諸機關器官息息相關，內臟之影饗，腺體之分泌，肌肉之弛張，供隨情緒以作用。蓋其爲對刺激之必要適應，亦爲綏靖刺激之唯一方法。悲喜而無故發生，自然是一種病態；可悲可喜之事當前，如果悲喜之情緒不能從而發生，則也是一種病態。情緒有如流水，順之則暢，阻之則泛濫千里，故欲求精神狀態之平衡與健康，適當的悲喜情緒的宣洩，爲不可或缺之事。</p>
<p>盡情悲喜，因爲一種理想，而我們復不能不因這現實環境的種種制約，以致往往不能盡情悲喜。這是古往今來的人的苦惱，也是古往今來的人的精神健康的陷阱。爲了解除這苦惱，爲了超越這陷阱，於是人類企求造成一種幻境，而在這幻境裏，求得悲喜情緒的盡情宣洩。這幻境便是藝術的創作與欣賞。</p>
<p>古希臘是人類藝術的泉源，古希臘人是最能盡情宣洩悲喜情緒的民族。由於人的性格的不同，他們創造了許多性格不同的神，而藉道些神，發抒了他們的悲與喜的情緒。酒神達峨尼塞司是熱情奔放的神，他深嚐人類的不幸與苦惱，於是，爲了祭祀他，希臘人創造了悲劇；更爲了調劑悲哀的情緒，希臘人復效法酒神的狂歡，創造了喜劇。人類有了悲劇與喜劇，更演化爲各種悲劇性和喜劇性的藝術，於是，人類的悲與喜的情緒，更有了許多可以盡情宣洩的機會與塲所。</p>
<p>藝術是幻境，因此，它給予人的悲喜情緒的刺激有異於眞實的人生，於是，它使人們感到的是「哀而不怨，樂而不淫」的純淨情緒，對人類精神健康更有莫大的裨益。更由於藝術的啟示，使我們感到一種靜觀的喜悅。不論是任何悲喜，只要你靜靜去體味那悲喜的滋味，那悲喜便不復是眞實的悲喜，而成了佛家的所謂「眞如」，於是悲不復悲，喜不復喜，你便與自然合一，與宇宙同在，而入於永恒的境界，這便是人類感情生活的昇華與結晶。</p>

<p>— ·朱顏·</p>
<p>秋夢是暫短的，零亂的，然而却是守信的。祗要我閉上眼睛，呼吸一沉重，心的跳動一軟弱，她就像秋天自然而然地落下來的一片葉子一樣，輕飄飄地落上我腦的銀幕，并且活動起來，從來也沒有爽過一次約。</p>
<p>她彷彿是帶着苦戀的心情，到處逍尋着我，捕捉着我。她是來自遠方的，隔了遼遠的一片原野，一條深闊的江流，還透過一重重的烟火的壕塹；因爲她來了，常把我也帶到那些地方。她又是一個固執的戀舊者，引我走到已去的許多歲月；也許有幸福的享受，也許是苦難的重嚐。</p>
<p>這樣的說法，并沒有錯。秋夢—這一個　人的多姿的妖魔，確實是主動的尋找着我。胡亂向床上一躺，她正好找過着。試行不把手壓在胸膛上，她也來了。甚至我學習一種受戒期的僧侶的睡法，然而也不能把她拒絕。</p>
<p>……深秋的黃昏，圍繞着一個莊園的河岸上，整排的高大的楡樹，已經落下一半枝柯的葉子—楡樹是易凋的；紅稈的蘆花完全白了頭，嫩黃的葉是牠的衣裳，站隊似的排列在岸邊的水上，塲圃正對着這樹蔭和白荻的河邊，一個像高裝饅頭的形狀，高出崖頂的稻草堆，整齊地站在塲圃的一角，下面蜷睡了一條花狗…這場面一展開，我的一個死了好幾年的妹妹，就在這靜寂的塲園和我說話：</p>
<p>「哥！我是死也不上×家去的！我打算讀書去，走得遠遠的！」</p>
<p>我也說着永遠同樣的一句話：</p>
<p>「你放心住着！先養好你的病，我是帮助你到底的！」</p>
<p>她慘白的臉上，露出一個笑容；頰上泛起兩朶朶哺潮的肺病患者的美麗的紅雲。</p>
<p>我覺得再要說什麼話的時侯，就自然而然的淸醒了！揉揉眼，却想到僅長成了一棵冬靑樹的孤另的黃土墳；這里，正是她說這話的第二年的歸宿。兩年前的忌日，她的姪女兒已會在那冬靑樹下面拜一位認不得的姑媽了。</p>
<p>懶洋洋地看着陽光漸漸在窗口暗淡，連追憶的心情都沒有，短暫無憑的白日之夢呀！</p>
<p>假如夢更完全些，或者抹上一點希望的雲彩，我眞是要張開手臂向她迎迓。然而她却是飄忽，零亂，灰暗無光，像落不完的秋葉，一片片飛來，飛散！</p>

<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>關放這邊的工作，我們覺得很簡單輕便，隊長告訴我們，準定要在二十八日零時，或至遲天亮前三點，就發動反正大運動，以聯絡「保安隊」爲主體，自治偽軍爲次要目標。隊長命令我同虎弟，担任保安隊聯絡特派員。我同虎弟祗花了一半天功夫，找到幾個　子的人，（當然位置較高一點的），同他們談了幾句。找熟人是虎弟的功勞，說話是我的工作。往下就由我們担任兩面談判，傳達條件，手續，約期，等等。隊長和他部下，本來己輕進行了許多聯絡工作，所以我們辦事，竟順手得很。</p>
<p>自治軍方面，人頭太複雜，簡直也談不到紀律，系絲，同時，那裏面虎弟和我認識的人太少。事情就沒有那麼爽利。我們着手在第十二團　，先成立了一個中心，可是幾個頭腦方面所提條件太苛刻，也可說太混賬，他們要求總指揮權，連保安隊都得受他們指揮。這一條倒也　了。第二條，他們說一反正後，就得讓他們主持行政，抄查漢奸家產。換句話，就是要搶刧一陣。</p>
<p>爲了這兩個條件，談判了不少時間，往反週折，麻煩無數，却始終談不攏來。這般偽軍，大多數是烏合之衆，流鄙，混混，關外存不住身的雜脾軍，及小股山賊等等；總之，都是第四五流的社會渣滓。從這一點上，我忽然想起了一個人，他是我們　子裏的一個小組頭日，江湖上道路極寬，什麼三敎九流的人，他多少都有些來往，現在住在北平飯店，給　子裏担任着收發及交通職務。他若能抽閒，到這裏來，帶同進行談判，憑他關外的名頭，定能收功。</p>
<p>我把這事同隊長一商量，隊長立刻電達北平總隊長，請他派人代我把那個頭目找來。　電說「即辦」。那位頭目有事躭擱，昨晚才匆匆趕到這裏。我們仔細討論了一陣之後，他花了大半夜工夫，邀請了偽軍第十二團裏幾個主要人物，舉行了一個秘密會談。總算不出我之所料，把雙方條件，折衝了下來；關於舉行反正，鋤奸，維持秩序，解決城內敵方武裝，佈防，與城外敵軍對壘，與我方正規軍聯絡，等等人事方面，擬成了一張職務名單。這麼一來，雖說聯絡工作，大致就緒，只是時間方面，却延遲了幾個鐘頭：大家商妥，準定明日淸晟五時發動。在發動之前，幾個鐘頭內，必須把種種應行佈置的事，要完全辦得嚴秘週到。</p>
<p>這時，時鐘已經指到一點五十分上，那就是二十八日晟一點五十分，只差幾個鐘頭，日方就要發動七七以來，正式大戰的第一慕——「拂曉攻擊」——。根據情報，我們知道通縣城外日寇駐軍，在　時左右已經調動就緒，只娜時間一到，就可開火。最最可恨的一點，就是這第十二團偽自治軍，生出許多麻煩，把時間給躭悞了，要在我們預期的零時或淸晨三時，準時發動，在這日寇的心臟內，來這麼一個大舉動，在我軍政雙方，該是多們有意義有價値的動作。只可惜晚了這麼幾小時！</p>

<p>人類常常有許多可笑的行爲，這就是製造一些故事來欺騙自己。這一行爲有目的的，目的在求下意識的滿足。</p>
<p>紐倫堡處決納粹十一個戰犯的死刑，在那樣戒備森嚴的佈置下，戈林却居然從容自殺，免去上絞刑台一幕，累得主其事者現在還在偵査，這消息够刺戟，也够轟動的了，然而人們還不能滿足，甚至說那被執行絞刑的都是草人，十個眞罪犯業已逍遙法外。這一傳說，並非一定在攻擊寬縱或其它政治上的陰謀，而是由於一種英雄祟拜的思想作祟。</p>
<p>說紐倫堡絞刑合上都是草人，和說希特勒至今還在人間是同一觀念的出發。這其間，自然有各式各種合有投機作用的人在利用人們這種心理而推波助瀾，擴大編浩了。</p>
<p>地無分中外，時不論古今，都有這類的故事。在上海，就曾傳佈過閻瑞生改名換姓，如何如何的說法；而水滸傳後有蕩寇志，紅樓夢後有紅樓續夢，三國誌後有反三國誌，古人亦猶如是也·</p>

<p>— 征</p>
<p>二十日本刋載有一幀名貴照片：一位三十九歲的新郞査來，比斯和他那位高壽七十有七的新娘合影。這種事在我們中國人看來，委實是駭人聽聞。世上的婚姻，駭人聽聞的不在少數。先請看下面一則「舊聞」：</p>
<p>一九三六年，埃及有位老人，年已一百三十歲，尙擬與一年二十五歲的女郞結婚。此老人已結婚十九次，諸妻都已病故，有子女二十三人。這些子女們對老父的續絃，極端反對，認爲年已逾百，體力己衰，且和其對象相差一百零五歲之多，允不相宜，勸老父慎重其事，致貽後悔。不料那位老人堅決表示：年齡雖老，健康猶在。並且大發脾氣：『結婚乃老夫自由！兒女輩無權干涉！」</p>
<p>這位老人，不但「童心未退」，而且固執得有些天眞，像這樣的事，實在不易遇到，因爲一個一百三十歲的老人就非常難覓了。在美國，夫妻間年齡懸殊的相富不少。一九三七年，唐納西州一個九歲的女孩溫斯德竟和一個身長六呎二十二歲的靑年約翰舉行婚禮，一時全國興論沸騰，說是「野蠻」，「可怕」，甚至說是國家的恥辱」！唐納西州的牧師及社會運動者，更發起「反對運動」，紐約世界電訊報特撰評論：「如果我們想到他們乃是一班山野退化的人民，我們就曉得文化對於他們並未曾給予多少帮助。』但是雙方父母都予以許可，他們的婚姻已算是合法了</p>
<p>俄亥俄州有位十三歲的女孩依珊勃兒，嫁給三十七歲的亨利，女孩的父母急得連忙向法庭起訴，請求宣吿婚姻無效。</p>
<p>在朝鮮，一般妻子，普通比他的丈夫要大十歲。家中產一男孩，就爲他聘來一個十餘歲的童媳，男未成人，女已在性慾强盛時，依據朝鮮習俗，男子得再娶納妾，女子絕對不得重婚或茍且。因此常常有殺夫另求滿足性慾的慘案。</p>
<p>空前記錄</p>
<p>一九三五年，國民社貝爾格勒電訊：在羅馬尼亞捉去一個名叫馬尼亞的靑年，馬氏年紀只有二十八歲，在五年內共娶八十個妻子，曾耗費美金二十萬元，在每次結婚後，即騙取女十的金錢，隨即遺棄。五年中娶八十位老婆，平均計算，差不多每二十火便要一位新娘，其手段「偉大」，眞是嘆爲觀止。</p>
<p>法國有一位名依利白梅的女子，從十八歲到二十八歲十年中，會和四十八個男子結過婚，共離婚了四十七次。許多丈夫之中，有律師，有小學敎員，有新聞記者，有大商人，有運動家，有小官僚，有醫生，有藝術家，有銀行家，……論國籍，除法國人外、有美國人，英國人，德國人，印度人，日本人，義大利人，阿刺伯人，俄國人，土耳其人，猶太人。南斯拉夫人，……其中同居得最長久的是他最末一個丈夫，—一位建築工程師。最短的只有三天。</p>

<p>— 金嘉平</p>
<p>當你做一件事的時候，你以爲這是你自動的行爲嗎？不，你是被動呢。比喻說，你預備作一决旅行，別人從未向你提議，一切都是你自已的主意，然而你怎麽會有旅行的思想呢？分析起來有下列幾點原因：</p>
<p>（一）你有了一個假期或空暇時間。</p>
<p>（二）感到煩悶需要旅客行來調濟精神。</p>
<p>（三）因爲職業關係而旅行。</p>
<p>關於第一點你的假期當然要經過核准，你不能自作主張任意指定假期，而且即使你有了空暇時間，你可有興趣或機會在雨季，戰時或極熱的天氣旅行嗎？當然你不能或不會·你的動機是因天氣晴明或高爽而引起吧了。第二點煩悶的原因或是因爲工作刻板地繁忙或什麽事使你感到不快。第三點你是被人雇用着而旅行。總之，你做一件事必有一個原由，就因爲這原由你是被動了·</p>
<p>世界上任何事物的發生，乃由於各物間動作的連鎖反應作用所致。我們在玩積木時排立了許多木塊，中間空着少許地位，只需將第一塊准壓在第二塊上，那末接二連三地這一排積木統統被壓倒了。當你上課遲到，受敎師責問的時候，你的理由是電車太擁擠。這不是很好的例子嗎？如果電重甚空，你就不會遲到了。要是你不信任我的話，這可說是自動了，然而你仍舊是被動，因爲你不信任的思想的發生，却由於讀了這篇文字，假使我不寫，你根本不知我，當然也不會有不信任我的事了。</p>
<p>既然工切都是被動，倒底是被誰動着呢？那個起源的主動是誰呢？我們知道地球是從太陽分出來的一部份，牠的旋轉而不脫軌道是因爲太陽的吸力所致。人類靠了這吸力才生長。也就是人類的行動受太陽所控制着。但太陽也是宇宙間星球之一，牠的行動（科學家證明太陽的位置常在移動）也受其他星球的吸引而發生變化。在這無限大的宇宙間，每個星球的動作響應着別的屋球。我們人類要在這神秘不可思議的宇宙間硏究出主動的起源，那是不可能的·如果你是教徒，你一便可說一切是上帝所主宰，但是，但是上帝的來歷呢？又是一個問題了。</p>

<p>— 甘來</p>
<p>在許些塲合中，女性具有極高的身份，「千金一笑」，「一吻千金」，成爲古今輝映佳話。祗要是一個模樣生得不醜的女人，縱在不景氣的時期，總要比男子來得有辦法。最近本市舉行的「上海小姐」選舉，投票一張，便要一千元，得票最多的冠軍，共得六千五百五十萬元，替難胞造福不淺，間接說明了女人的身似，倒底不是我輩臭男子所能企及的。</p>
<p>但是，有一處地方，女人被視爲最卑賤，一文不値的東西：女孩一生下來，便被生埋活葬，或者作爲贈品般的免費奉送。</p>
<p>不是奇談</p>
<p>以上所述，並不是海外寄聞，也不是已經絕跡了的陳風舊俗。它發生在今日的中華民國：</p>
<p>新興縣是廣省的一個三等縣治，人口約有十三四萬，文化的落後，思想的頑固，風俗的奇特，到今日還沒有絲毫的改變。</p>
<p>腦中深存有重男輕女的觀念，新興的女人，遂被目爲牛馬不如的動物。在那兒，一般人家生了女兒，便皺眉嘆氣，叫一個無業的老窮婆到來，請她吃一頓酒菜，給好一些錢，另外還說一番多謝的話，請她將育下的女孩抱去，送給別人做童養媳，或者婢女。</p>
<p>等於牛馬</p>
<p>倘若遇着好心的老婆子，她眞把那一個女嬰送到收容的人家，等她長大，便作爲那家人的媳婦，終是辛勞操作，受盡欺凌虐待，生活等於牛馬。假使遇着黑心的老婦，她抱了孩子，走到僻靜之處，先剝下孩子的衣服，接着把女孩光着身，擲到河心去，路人遇見，也認爲司空見慣的閒事，不加干涉。窮人家產下女孩，手段更爲毒辣，自己動手，將女兒投下一枯兒塔」，所謂「枯兒塔」，是一個中空的石塔，外面近頂端，　有一個圓洞，棄嬰即由這洞口投入，成了活葬。這種石塔在新興很多，每一個「枯兒塔」，平均每日至少有三兩個無辜的女孩，在內裏生。</p>
<p>大家試爲閉目一想：這是一幅何等驚心可恥的岡畫！</p>

<p>「失業』，比貧，比病，比死更怕人，它和戰爭同樣，是世界上頂可怕的事情！</p>
<p>祗要有了職業，起碼的生活總可獲得：兵，醫生會繪本　我們診治；死，違觀的人看得很平淡。但是「失業」呢？起嗎的生活中繼了，也沒有醫生會診，最達觀的人，也要搖頭嘆息。</p>
<p>雖有些人們對「失業者」表示同情，又多是愛莫能助，有的僅僅表示同情而已。至於那些職業介紹所，和上面的社會服務　等，也不過想法介紹而已。</p>
<p>所以我們要提倡「職業保險」，要提倡一個既能介紹職業又能供給失業期間一家人生活費用的機構。要請現在有職業的朋友們，試一想像失業時的苦情，大家合力同心，抱「人人爲我，我爲人人」的好心，來組織一個「職業保險」的機構！</p>
<p>職業保險的機構，即跟其他人壽等保險差不多，又滲着些合作事業的精神，而且更要積極些，不但供給已保險的失業者一家人生活費用，更須負起介紹職業的養務，還有調查所以失業之原由，恊助失業者復業。</p>
<p>除此之外，對尚未實行保險手續，織納保險費用的失業者，也須負起義務的職業介紹和供給最少量的生活費，惟是項生活費，須於有職業之日起按期歸還。</p>
<p>如果有這樣的一個機構，這不是社會上的大大福音嗎？我們期待着。</p>

<h3 id="c186">美男子哈立曼　—美國新任商務部長 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 幼南</p>
<p>華萊士去職以後，美國商務部長一職，由杜魯門總統在上月二十三日宣佈，以哈立曼接充。下面便是關於這一個人物的生平事蹟。</p>
<p>人緣不壞</p>
<p>威廉·亞佛得爾·哈產曼。本來是美國的鐵路與金融界的巨擘，一九四一年三月，他會以公使名義，赴英國洽商租借法案延長事宜，同年九月，他更率領美國使節圍，偕同前英國生產部大臣皮佛勃浴克，同往莫斯科，擬訂英美蘇三國間的租借援助法則。一九四二年，他曾參加與邱吉爾，史達林間的三人會議，一九四三年年十月，他奉命任美國駐蘇大使，在蘇聯的人綠不壞，卸任　國時，史達林特地贈給他兩匹駿馬。</p>
<p>從哈立曼過去的經歷上看，可證他也是美國政治舞台上的一個重要角色。</p>
<p>有錢的人</p>
<p>哈氏的父親，在生時也時一位有名望的實業家，曾任美國兩家鐵路公司的理事長，闢劃建設的鐵路很多，當他過世以後，哈立曼更得承受了二千五百萬元美金的遺產，後來他將這一筆鉅額資金，輕營運用，結果造成了他目前爲全美國第四位首富的地位，財產多得難以確計。</p>
<p>但是，哈立曼的生活極爲平民化，時常在小餐館裏進膳，偶然也不拘形式的和街頭小販談話說笑，口才不弱，政敵把他稱作「一個謎樣的男人』。</p>
<p>佳君子也</p>
<p>他對服裝頗爲講究，喜歡穿灰褐色的西部收牛郞裝，還戴上一頂闊邊的　帽，顯得非常英俊，過去曾被列爲美國十大美男子之一。</p>
<p>哈立曼是耶魯大學一九一三年的畢業生，當在學校肄業時，他常利用暑假期，祖任測量員和當地的救火員。畢業以後，他便供職在他的父親主持下的鐵路公司裏面。他對文化交流　鐵路行政，硏究有素，故羅斯福總統，時常召詢他關於鐵路施政的事宜。</p>
<p>漂亮女兒</p>
<p>無論哈立曼到什麼地方去，身旁多半有一個年輕美麗的女人伴着，那是他的能幹的女兒葛富蓮·她替父親主持一切家務。</p>
<p>哈立曼在接任商務部長的時候，發表聲明，擁護杜魯門總統和貝爾納斯的政治主張，並謂美國貿易發展，有賴世界各國的合作及和平。</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 21st] After meeting with representatives of various parties at the National Government at 11:00 AM on the 21st, Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife, departed Beijing at 12:35 PM on the "Meiling" special plane to fly to Taiwan. Chairman Chiang wore a yellow military uniform today, without collar badges or medals, and a tweed cap. His wife wore a black floral qipao and a short fur shawl. Under the clear autumn sun, they looked radiant. Only Commander-in-Chief Zhou Zhirou and Chiang Ching-kuo saw them off at the airport. When the Chairman got out of the car to board the plane, Zhou and others stood at attention and saluted, and the Chairman took off his hat to return the salute. Today, the plane did not taxi to the apron in front of the Fifth Brigade's waiting room; the Chairman boarded the plane on the runway. It is said that the Chairman's trip to Taiwan is to preside over the Taiwan Retrocession Anniversary celebration on the 25th. When meeting with representatives of various parties, he informed them that he would be going to Taiwan and said that he would return to Beijing in three to five days to meet with everyone again. Chen Xizeng and his entourage, who accompanied the Chairman, flew ahead on the morning of the 20th. Yu Jishi, Shen Changhuan, Cao Shengfen, and others departed on the "Chasing Cloud" special plane before the Chairman. Few people knew about the Chairman's departure. By the time Minister Bai and Chief of Staff Chen arrived, the "Meiling" plane had already taken off into the sky.</p>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch on the 21st] The Chairman and his wife arrived safely in Taipei on the special "Aviation" plane at 3:45 PM. This is the first time the Chairman and his wife have visited Taiwan in more than 50 years since its fall to Japan. Compatriots here are making grand welcomes with the most enthusiastic and excited emotions. The Chairman will console Taiwanese compatriots here and preside over the grand ceremony of the Taiwan Retrocession Anniversary. (The above shows the interior of the guesthouse of the Taiwan Provincial Government.)</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 21st] The peace talks, which had been suspended for a long time in the capital, received good news from the sky today. Political figures and greeters at the airport were exceptionally busy. Under the bright autumn sun, everyone was smiling, as if celebrating a happy occasion. Representatives of the Communist Party, the Youth Party, the Democratic League, and social leaders in Shanghai returned to Beijing together this morning by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) planes and US military special planes from Shanghai. The Chairman appointed Wu Tiecheng, Wang Shijie, Sun Ke, Shao Lizi, and Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference Lei Zhen to welcome the CNAC plane. When the door opened at 10:10 AM, Wu Tiecheng and Wang Shijie were the first to step forward to welcome them. Luo Longji was the first to disembark, followed by Li Weihan, and then the other representatives came down one after another. They included Youth Party representatives Zeng Qi, Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, Li Huang, Yu Jiaju, Yang Yongjun, and Secretary Liu Pengjiu; Democratic League representatives Zhang Junmai, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun, Jiang Yuntian, and Secretary Xu Chuanlin; and social leaders Hu Lin and Guo Moruo. There were 19 people in total from the Communist Party, including Li Weihan and Chen Jiakang. Wu shook hands with each of the arrivals and conveyed the Chairman's greetings. All of them showed happy expressions. After disembarking, reporters asked them to express their feelings about arriving in Beijing. Their answers were mostly the same, that is, "very happy." Hu Lin said, "I am here to see them off," because Hu planned to return to Shanghai by train that evening. Li Huang said: The flight was smooth and we arrived safely in Beijing, which symbolizes the bright future of the negotiations. Guo Moruo said: I hope peace can be achieved. Luo Longji said: Today's solemn scene is the result of the Shanghai negotiations. This unofficial meeting will proceed smoothly, and then a ceasefire can be achieved, because today should be the day when Chinese people solve Chinese problems. Chen Jiakang said that the Chinese Communist Party is willing to follow various parties, social leaders, and the Chinese people to make contributions to justice and strive for democracy and peace. Shen Junru said that the third party came to Beijing this time, hoping to solve the problem satisfactorily, but this work is very difficult.</p>
<p>The crowd stopped for two minutes amidst the hustle and bustle, and the atmosphere was very harmonious. They then followed Wu Tiecheng, Wang Shijie, and Lei Zhen into cars to the National Council Hall for a rest.</p>
<p>The reporter then went to Dajiaochang Airport to welcome Zhou Enlai. Zhou's special plane landed at 10:40 AM. Zhou was the first to disembark and thanked Sun Ke and Shao Lizi who came to welcome him. Then he shook hands with Sun and took pictures. Reporters scrambled for this good shot. Zhou was wearing a light gray suit with a smile on his face. The reporter asked him to make a statement, but he declined. He then went with Sun and Shao to the National Council Hall. Shao's office became a grand gathering of influential figures. The reporter Luo Fu used a "divide and conquer" approach, asking everyone to express their opinions. Amidst the busyness, there was a feeling of celebrating a happy occasion.</p>
<p>At 11:00 AM, all the representatives went to the National Government to meet Chairman Chiang. The Chairman was fully dressed in military uniform, ready to depart. Seeing everyone, he expressed infinite joy and asked Zhou Enlai, "What are your opinions?" Zhou replied, "According to the Political Consultative Conference's resolution, we all agree." The Chairman then informed them of his trip to Taiwan. He also said, "I originally planned to go two days ago, but I stayed for two days because you were coming. It is very good that you have come today. In future discussions, President Sun will preside. I hope it can start immediately and be completed quickly." After a quarter of an hour, the representatives said goodbye and returned to their residences. At 12:30 PM, they attended a banquet hosted by the government representatives at the International United Society. After lunch, they held an informal exchange of views, which lasted until 3:00 PM. During the meeting, Sun Ke delivered a speech first. Then Zhou Enlai, Liang Shuming, Huang Yanpei, Luo Longji, Zhang Junmai, and Li Huang all put forward their opinions.</p>
<p>After 3:00 PM, the third party held a meeting at the Bank of Communications to exchange views; at 5:30 PM, they held an informal meeting at Sun Ke's residence. Those present included Chen Qitian, Zeng Qi, Li Huang, and Zuo Shunsheng of the Youth Party; Luo Longji and Huang Yanpei, Zhang Junmai of the Democratic League; Wu Tiecheng, Chen Bulei, Zhang Lisheng, Shao Lizi, Wang Shijie, Sun Ke, and Lei Zhen on the government side; and social leaders Mo Dehui and Hu Lin. The meeting ended at 8:15 PM.</p>
<p>It is reported that the discussion today was still a broad exchange of views, and the eight opinions put forward by the government were explained and studied. No concrete results were obtained, and the meeting will continue on the 22nd. The procedure for peace negotiations was also mentioned.</p>
<p>Li Huang, Zuo Shunsheng, and Hu Lin returned to Shanghai by night train at 11:00 PM. It is heard that Li and Zuo will return to Beijing by night train on the 22nd. Before leaving, Li told reporters about the meeting on the 21st: Even if we have great difficulties at present, we will work hard to achieve our goals. There is no need to exaggerate some pessimistic remarks. In short, in today's exciting atmosphere, I hope we can achieve something.</p>
<p>Liang Shuming told reporters that the current situation is still very dangerous. It seems commendable that the Communist Party representatives came here, but it may be the first step for them to return to Yan'an. Their determination to sacrifice is greater than their desire for compromise. There are crises in the negotiations. We still hope to endure them and must have a guarantee of peace. Although Marshall represents friendly nations to seek peace for us, his power is limited, and his work is also passive. We believe that the third party must unite and form a guarantee of peace autonomously, "with the Chinese as the main force and the Americans as the auxiliary force." Using this force to deal with this problem is what we think is a fair opinion. We must adopt it, otherwise, we will pursue the responsibility of those who do not. We also hope to give the third party an opportunity to participate in military affairs, not to participate in the military three-person meeting, but to exchange opinions outside the meeting as a bridge to promote the success of the three-person meeting.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The Capital High Court publicly tried Zhou Fohai for the first time on the 21st. Nearly ten thousand people attended the trial, and the order was extremely poor, setting a new record in the history of trying traitors in the capital. At 6:00 AM, attendees arrived in droves, and both inside and outside the Dacheng Hall was packed. The reporter seats and the government leader seats were all occupied. Court President Zhao Chen signed the writ of extraction at 7:40 AM. At 8:30 AM, the traitor Zhou was escorted to the High Court's holding room. At this time, the gates of the Dacheng Hall were tightly closed, and the crowd outside the hall became even more congested. Despite the efforts of Chief Commander Ge Zhaotang, the magistrate, to persuade them, it was to no avail. It was delayed until 9:50 AM when Court President Zhao Chen, accompanied by Associate Justices Jin Shiqiao and Jin Shiyu, along with Prosecutor Chen Sheng and Chief Clerk Luo Cuiru, ascended the court amidst the chaos. It took considerable effort from the police to carve out a small path through the crowd to escort the traitor Zhou into the court. The traitor Zhou was wearing a gray cloth long gown, blue-gray trousers, gray socks, and black round-toe leather shoes. He wore frameless glasses with hexagonal lenses. Witnessing the surging crowd, he appeared extremely embarrassed, and his face changed abruptly. While climbing the stone steps of the main hall, he trembled noticeably. After ascending the court and standing at the defendant's stand, his mouth twitched from time to time. With trembling hands, he fidgeted with three volumes of a ten-line notebook, using it to support himself on the desk. Then, he wiped his sweat with a handkerchief and glanced at his defense lawyers, Zhang Shijian, Wang Shanxiang, and Yang Jialin. After the presiding judge shouted, "Maintain order," the trial began.</p>
<p>In court, he was first questioned about his name, age, birthplace, Beijing address, and occupation. Amid the noisy chaos, the traitor Zhou shouted, "Zhou Fohai, fifty years old, from Yuanling, Hunan, residing at 8 Xiliuwan, Nanjing." Then, the prosecutor read the indictment, accusing him of participating in traitorous negotiations with the Japanese puppets and of the crime of betraying the country and fawning upon the enemy. Regarding his so-called surrender, it was merely empty talk, as he had already been openly wanted by the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office as early as November 4, 1939. Therefore, even if it were true, it could not be established, and the request for leniency was presumptuous. The charges were specially aggravated on these two points. The presiding judge then inquired about his family property. According to his statement, his family consisted of his wife, Yang Shuhui, his son, Shao Hai, aged twenty-eight, a graduate of the Chengdu Military Academy; daughters, Shuhai and Huihai; and sister, Fozhen. As for real estate, he only had the residence at 8 Xiliuwan in Nanjing, with fifteen or sixteen rooms. In Shanghai, there was a residence at 262 Hunan Road, with seven or eight rooms, and six rental houses on Yuyuan Road and other locations. For other movable properties, please refer to the investigation report of the Military Intelligence Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Describing the Course of Defection: Putting the Blame on Others, Justifying Himself in a Ridiculous Manner <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>After further questioning about his background and the positions he held before the war, the court asked, "Were you ever a minister in the National Government?" He replied, "No." The court asked, "Did you want to be?" He replied, "Of course I wanted to, but I didn't expect it, and I couldn't be. However, a government minister is specially appointed, while a party minister is elected, so it's even bigger." Asked, "Did you ever attend the Central Political Conference?" He replied, "I was an observer." Asked, "Then you must have known the country's policy of resistance against Japan and participated in the formulation of the regulations for punishing traitors. Why did you still become a traitor?" The traitor Zhou was speechless. After a moment, he began to elaborate on his traitorous philosophy, saying, "At that time, leaving Chongqing to join the puppet regime was a different political view. Now I realize it was a mistake, and I don't dare deny legal responsibility. But at that time, the international environment was unfavorable, the war situation was not good, and I had no confidence in the resistance. I believed that peace might be a way to save the country. Furthermore, I didn't want to advocate peace in the rear and affect the resistance, so I decided to sacrifice myself and advocate peace in the occupied areas. After arriving in Nanjing, I realized my behavior was wrong and actively tried to surrender and show loyalty to the central government." The traitor Zhou also emphasized that during his tenure as acting minister of the Central Publicity Department, he never made any remarks detrimental to the resistance. The presiding judge rebuked him, saying, "So you were outwardly resisting Japan but inwardly 'at peace'?" The traitor Zhou stammered for a while before saying, "Peace has no outward appearance." Regarding the "Low-Key Club," the traitor Zhou said, "It was just a joke by Mr. Hu Shih, and there was no organization. I had no contact with the traitor Wang in Nanjing, only learned from Gao Zongwu that Wang also advocated peace in a low-key manner." Afterward, he went on and on about his defection, briefly stating that "negotiations with the Japanese, Imai and Kagesa, were done by Mei Siping and Gao Zongwu, and he did not participate. Wang Jingwei talked to him about the peace conditions, which included good neighborly friendship, recognition of 'Manchukuo,' and joint anti-communism. He thought that these were not conditions for national subjugation and could be considered, but there were three prerequisites: (1) approval by the Japanese cabinet, (2) approval by the Japanese Imperial Council, and (3) announcement to the world. The Japanese agreed to all of them. The traitor Wang was very firm, and the traitor Mei was even more so. He was uncertain, so he followed them." He also cunningly claimed, "Now I deeply regret leaving Chongqing and should be punished. But in Nanjing for five years, it was a history of struggle. If I am convicted because of it, it would be difficult for me to accept." The traitor Zhou continued to confess about the various measures of the puppet government and his personal actions. Regarding the convening of the puppet Sixth National Congress, he blamed it on the reorganization faction led by Lin Baisheng and others. Regarding the puppet government's declaration to return to the capital, which negated all laws and organizations of the National Government in Chongqing, he blamed it on Wang Zhaoming's sole decision. As for his continued clinging to the puppet government after realizing his mistake, he cunningly claimed that he wanted to "actively perform meritorious service." Regarding the organization of the puppet government, he cunningly claimed that it was a reenactment of the two splits of the Ning-Han and Beijing-Tianjin factions. As for signing contracts with the Japanese, he described it as an agreement with "children." He also denied ever interfering in the affairs of the puppet military commission, participating in the Clear Villages Committee meetings, presiding over the work of poisoning the youth, and co-signing the declaration of war against Britain and the United States. After the court confronted him with the facts and his traitorous remarks, Zhou Fohai repeatedly said, "I know my guilt!" "I regret it!" He also said, "I cannot shirk responsibility for my actions. Deep down, I was indeed doing it for my country. It can be said that I was 'colluding with the enemy to seek relief for my country!'" The court retorted, "What is 'colluding with the enemy' if not opposing your own country? If this is allowed, it is sufficient evidence of your collusion with the enemy and betrayal of the country, and there is no room for argument." Zhou Fohai then silently said, "I definitely don't want to deny it."</p>
<h3 id="e18">Showing Off His "Merits" in an Ugly Manner: Claiming Issuing Puppet Currency Was to Resist Japanese Military Scrip; Said That Self-Surrender Was to Show Heart <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>The traitor Zhou then continued to describe the situation of the puppet Ministry of Finance and the Central Reserve Bank in great detail. According to him, the reserves of the Central Reserve Bank consisted of 50,231 bars of gold (ten taels per bar), US$5.5 million, over 7.639 million taels of silver, 330,000 silver dollars, 9.23 million Japanese yen, 200 million Japanese government bonds, over 52 million yuan in Shanghai bills of exchange, and other stocks, movable properties, and immovable properties. The amount of Central Reserve Bank notes issued was 41 trillion yuan. All files on various properties had been transferred to the Bank of China last year. Zhou boasted extensively about his "struggle" in issuing puppet currency to resist military scrip and confront the Japanese, and vehemently argued, "Did the central government not want the 8 million people in the occupied areas? Issuing currency, setting prices, and maintaining people's livelihoods is definitely not a crime!" Regarding the issue of surrender, Zhou Fohai confessed that after he appointed Cheng Keqiang and Peng Suxiang in 1941, Cheng and Peng were arrested by Li Shiqun. After he rescued them, he learned that they were personnel of the Military Intelligence Bureau. He asked them to leave Shanghai for Chongqing in October 1942 to liaise with the central government. The two returned to Shanghai in 1943, carrying a letter written by the late Director Dai Yunong, informing him that Chairman Chiang had approved his surrender, and he began work. The letter had been destroyed. One sentence in it could be said in a secret court. He also said that Commander-in-Chief He had acknowledged his surrender when he accepted the surrender in Nanjing last year. The traitor Zhou also made a boastful statement, saying, "I don't want to reduce my sentence by surrendering, I just want to show my heart. In terms of law, whether it's beheading or shooting!" He also said, "On September 30 last year, I telegraphed the Chairman to ask if I should go to Chongqing. The Chairman telegraphed back to tell me to go. I went immediately, saying it could be an arrest or a voluntary surrender." At this point, Zhou Fohai's defense lawyer, Wang Shanxiang, stood up and presented a volume of sixteen favorable pieces of evidence collected by the three defense lawyers according to law, and asked the court to rule on them, and hoped to acknowledge his achievements in colluding with the Military Intelligence Bureau to carry out counter-espionage work, fully summon witnesses, review files, and Gu Qian, the former commander of the Third War Area, also replied in a letter that he would allow the files to be reviewed and witnesses to be summoned, and asked for detailed investigation. Then, witnesses Zhou, (person in charge of the Military Intelligence Bureau sent to Nanjing for counter-espionage work), Zhang Shuping (Zi Xing, former liaison representative of the Third War Area stationed in Shanghai), and Yang Siyi (former senior staff officer of the General Headquarters of the Su-Zhe-Wan Border Area Guerrilla Army) were summoned in turn, all proving that Zhou Fohai had assisted in the counter-espionage work in great detail, and an investigation showed that Zhou Fohai had sent a letter to Niu Fuzhang and replied to Zhang Shijian. The presiding judge ordered Zhang and Yang to submit written proofs to the court within two days. At this point, Zhou Fohai looked happy and shouted, "Please make a ruling, from 1942 onwards, I was 'colluding with the enemy to plot against the enemy country'." At this time, it was 1:20 PM. After the clerk stood up and read the minutes, the court announced, "This hearing is still in the nature of an investigation. Today cannot be concluded. The trial will be rescheduled, and the defendant will be remanded." The court adjourned at 2:00 PM. Attendees left with the traitor Zhou, and the Dacheng Hall was left with broken tables and chairs, and a mess of dirt. The emptiness and desolation of the hall, compared with the chaos and noise a few minutes earlier, were in stark contrast, truly like a battlefield after a disaster.</p>

<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 21st] The embezzlement case of the Public Works Bureau Transportation Office, which was uncovered by the investigation team in Tianjin, was publicly tried by the Tianjin District Court for the first time on the 20th, lasting all day. Those involved in the case included the Director of the Public Works Bureau, Wang Xijun, the Director of the Transportation Office, Yao Zhenyu, the Chief of the General Affairs Section, Zhang Xiaochun, and the Chief of the Warehouse Section, Zhu Shuan, and twelve others. Wang Xijun claimed ignorance of the embezzlement and sale of received materials. Zhang Xiaochun repeatedly quibbled about the fake accounts, fake receipts, stamps, and other evidence found in his office desk, but his loopholes were numerous, causing laughter in the audience from time to time. The judge asked about his false reimbursement, saying, "The actual expenditure was over 2 million, why did you report over 7 million?" He confessed, "That was a plan I wrote when I was idle!" Asked, "Are the receipts fake?" He confessed, "Not all of them are fake." Yao Zhenyu and other criminals also tried to shirk responsibility. The court adjourned in the evening and will be rescheduled.</p>
<h3 id="e20">"Accepting" Enemy Property Should Be Called "Recovering": Liu Jiwen's Return to Nanjing <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Liu Jiwen, Deputy Minister of the Audit Department, recently returned to Nanjing after going to North China and Northeast China to audit the list of economic construction and property received. According to Liu, many factories in the north were dismantled and plundered after repeated riots after the Japanese surrender, making restoration difficult. He had different opinions on the word "receiving" for the reception of enemy property, believing that it should be called "recovering" rather than "receiving," because since the September 18 Incident, the Japanese occupied the Northeast, seized materials and raw materials locally, and exploited the labor of our compatriots with low wages. They also used names such as conscription, requisition, and requisition to enslave our people to engage in production. They looted and moved materials produced with our land, materials, people, and labor to Japan, and it is unknown how many. Therefore, everything produced by using our country's land, materials, people, and labor is actually owned by our country. Therefore, the factories, mines, and properties received after the recovery of the Northeast are actually "recovering" our inherent properties. As for how to recover the materials that were moved away for more than ten years, it is also worth studying.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Difficulties in UNRRA Transportation Gradually Reduced; Goods in Warehouses Being Cleared; Huo Baoshu Inspected Warehouses Yesterday and Went to Beijing on Official Business Today <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[Local News] Director Huo Baoshu of UNRRA Headquarters told the Central News Agency reporter yesterday that the difficulties in UNRRA transportation have gradually decreased, and most of the relief supplies stored in various warehouses are being cleared. He personally inspected the various wharf warehouses one by one yesterday, and several warehouses have been cleared. There are currently 110,000 to 120,000 tons of goods stored in the warehouses, most of which are heavy machinery and cannot be transported out for the time being. If UNRRA supplies are not expedited to China, the supplies that UNRRA plans to transport out next month may be interrupted. This shows that UNRRA's transportation capacity is increasing day by day, and there is no problem in clearing the supplies. The reporter asked about UNRRA's current financial situation. Huo replied that UNRRA's funds are raised from various sources. The 430 billion yuan allocated by the Executive Yuan is a relief fund, which is different from expenses. It has been received and used by some of the institutions responsible for relief work under UNRRA. As for the funds obtained from suspected sales of goods, the amount is very small and does not provide much assistance. He is currently planning the source of UNRRA's funds and will have a detailed plan in two or three weeks. Regarding the personnel changes after the change of the Director of UNRRA Headquarters, Huo believed that there would be no changes. The previous rumors that Deputy Director Li Zhuomin would leave his job were not true, and the personnel of other departments also remained in their positions.</p>
<p>(Also reported) Huo is scheduled to go to Beijing on official business today and return to Shanghai tomorrow.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The Red Cross emblem is the property of the Red Cross Society worldwide. Except for the military medical institutions and personnel that can use the special symbol of the white background with the red cross as stipulated in the 1929 International Red Cross Convention and recognized and permitted by the Taiguo government, other individuals or groups may not falsely use it for commercial or other purposes. Since the Anti-Japanese War, non-statutory health institutions, practicing physicians, and merchants in various places in our country have widely used the white background with the red cross symbol, which is detrimental to international reputation. The General Association of the Chinese Red Cross Society has recently presented a petition to the Executive Yuan for approval to issue a notice to all provincial and municipal governments across the country, and requested the Ministry of Health to notify all provincial and municipal health bureaus to severely suppress it.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tainan, 21st] The Wendan produced in Madou Town, Zengwen District, Tainan County, is famous far and wide. According to a field investigation by reporters, this kind of fruit tree is not planted in a planned manner, nor is it operated by the government. It is one of the side businesses of local farmers, and it is planted casually in gardens. This tree blooms in early spring every year and is harvested in mid-August. There are currently 30,000 Wendan trees in the Zengwen District, and Madou Town has 20,000 trees, with better soil quality. The annual output is about 800,000 branches. Last year, due to the impact of the typhoon, only 30% of this year's harvest was obtained. This year, there was another severe typhoon disaster, and tree branches were broken, so next year's output will be even less, and the planned production figures will not be reached. According to Ding Mingnan, the head of the Zengwen District, the district plans to plant Wendan extensively on 300 acres of open space in Madou in the future, with an estimated 100,000 trees to be planted, and plans to allocate a budget of one million Taiwan dollars in the next year, specifically for purchasing fertilizers and encouraging farmers to produce. If the plan is successful, the production of Wendan in Madou will increase greatly.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Review of Taiwan's Governance <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Taiwan's retrocession has swiftly passed a year. Recently, journalist delegations from Beijing and Shanghai returned from Taiwan, bringing faithful reports about the island. Chairman Chiang also flew to Taiwan yesterday for an inspection. Taiwan's governance should be a matter of concern for all parties. Taiwan had been under enemy occupation for nearly fifty years, during which the people of Taiwan had fully tasted the bitterness of Japanese military rule. Now that the land has been restored, the entire nation has expressed boundless excitement over Taiwan's return to the embrace of the motherland. On the government's side, our leader, despite being burdened with myriad daily affairs, flew south for inspection, demonstrating how much our Chairman cares about the governance of Taiwan and the Taiwanese people. In our nation's history, Taiwan had a brilliant past. In the late Ming dynasty, Koxinga used Taiwan as a base to resist foreign invasion, a heroic and tragic act that set a good example for our nation, preserving our national integrity. From the late Qing dynasty to recent times, the Taiwanese people's loyalty to the nation has been able to uphold Koxinga's legacy and continue to demonstrate it in various ways. In terms of national consciousness, the Taiwanese people can be said to be particularly strong. Now that they have returned to their homeland, the feelings of the Taiwanese people are as excited as our welcoming of the return of our Taiwanese brothers, and we feel the same way.</p>
<p>We should especially cherish this kind of emotional exchange, as it is this emotional exchange that solidifies the entire nation into an unbreakable whole. Now that the Taiwanese people have returned, what they hope for from the motherland may be very urgent, and the reconstruction of national governance in Taiwan may not be able to fully meet the ideals of the Taiwanese people. If such a state exists, it is understandable. Taiwan's retrocession has been just over a year, and in terms of governance, it may not have fully met everyone's expectations. We need patience. The government should, in the course of implementing national policies, respect the wishes of the Taiwanese people. We must not lose the hearts of the Taiwanese people. Now that Taiwan has returned to the embrace of the motherland, under the supreme guiding principle of the Three Principles of the People for our nation-building, Taiwan should become an ideal experimental area for the construction of the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>Speaking of Taiwan's current political system, the reason why it is different from the provinces of the mainland is that it is a transitional measure adapted to the times and local conditions. In principle, we oppose the specialization of local politics, and the laws and regulations generally applicable to all provinces should also be applicable to Taiwan. However, at least for now, we cannot but recognize the specialization of Taiwan's governance as a wise decision. Taiwan has been under Japanese rule for a long time, and the Japanese have actively promoted assimilation policies, so today's Taiwan does not seem to have completely eradicated the evils of past Japanese military rule. During this transitional period, Taiwan's specialization seems necessary. This specialization is manifested in the establishment of the administrative chief system and the special issuance of currency outside the legal tender system. All these measures are originally intended to seek the welfare of the Taiwanese people. The temporary suspension of legal tender in Taiwan and the becoming of the Taiwan dollar as currency were originally intended to prevent the evils of domestic currency expansion from affecting Taiwan, so that Taiwan's monetary and financial system could tend to be stable. However, according to Huang Chao-chin, Speaker of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly, "Taiwan's finances are more stable than in the mainland, but in the eyes of Taiwanese compatriots, it is worse than during the Japanese occupation, and the economy is more painful because of currency inflation and rising prices." Since these words came from the speaker of the assembly representing public opinion, they are presumably not without reason. Therefore, we want to call the attention of the Taiwan authorities here. We know that under the control of the Taiwan authorities, even if the number of Taiwan dollars issued is slightly increased, it does not seem to cause malignant currency expansion, but since there is a tendency for prices to rise, this decline should be stopped as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Looking from the present to the future, since Taiwan should become an ideal experimental area for the construction of the Three Principles of the People, we cannot ignore some points that should be paid attention to in Taiwan's governance in the future. Taiwan was under Japanese rule for fifty years. In the past fifty years, all governance in Taiwan was centered on and based on Japan itself. Now that the land has been restored, we must not let this legacy be inherited. In the future, Taiwan's governance should be based on, centered on, and started from China. Based on this principle, we should improve the status of the Taiwanese people in culture, politics, and even economics. In terms of culture, the number of Taiwanese compatriots who received higher education in the past was not large. We should improve the cultural and educational level of Taiwanese compatriots in the future. Among them, what should be especially focused on is that we must integrate the cultural thoughts of the Taiwanese people with those of the mainland compatriots in the shortest possible time. In the past fifty years, under the enslavement and rule of Japanese warlords, the Taiwanese compatriots should eliminate narrow regional concepts, restore self-esteem and self-confidence, and join hands with compatriots across the country to move towards the road of nation-building in order to achieve the national rejuvenation of our country.</p>
<p>Regarding the development and utilization of Taiwan's resources, it already had a considerable scale during the period of Japanese warlord rule; however, we should note that Taiwan's economic development in the past was entirely centered on Japan and entirely focused on the needs of Japan's national defense. Today, Taiwan is left with oil factories and aluminum industries operated by the Japanese, but Taiwan itself does not have huge reserves and production of aluminum and oil. In terms of agriculture, Taiwan has mostly mountainous terrain and is not suitable for sugarcane production. For the needs of Japan itself, Taiwanese farmers were forced to give up the economically advantageous production of food and engage in sugarcane production. It may have been necessary in Japan, but we must not let this situation continue. Taiwan's economic development should be moved to appropriate locations in our mainland. At the same time, some industries that are economically advantageous in Taiwan should be supported for their development. For example, Taiwan's camphor industry originally accounted for 80% of the world's production, but now, due to the invention of substitutes, the need for camphor in the international market is not as great as before. How to enable this unique industry in Taiwan to have sound development and how to coordinate Taiwan's economic construction with the economic construction of the entire nation is a topic worthy of research and planning.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Taiwan's public land accounts for 70% of Taiwan's total land area. This is an ideal area for implementing the Three Principles of the People's land policy. Since the percentage of public land is so high, the ideal of "land to the tiller" and the Three Principles of the People's land policy can be fully realized. We consider Taiwan to be an ideal experimental area for the construction of the Three Principles of the People because Taiwan has all the necessary conditions. We hope that Taiwan, which has returned to the embrace of the motherland, can give the whole country a demonstration effect. Those who come later may surpass those who came before, and one day, the rest of the country may have to learn a lot from Taiwan. We firmly believe that the Taiwanese compatriots, who are close brothers, will definitely be happy to support the completion of this lofty mission. We extend our warm hands to our Taiwanese compatriots, wishing to join hands and move forward together on the road of nation-building from now on. The rejuvenation of the nation, perhaps it will be realized.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Labor Unrest Occurs in Hangzhou Silk Factories. Weicheng Factory Initiates, Forcibly Halting Work at Other Factories. Resumption of Work Preceded by Mediation by Relevant Authorities. <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 21st] Today, labor at Hangzhou's various silk factories requested reduced hours and increased wages, leading to labor unrest. Initially, on the 18th, a worker surnamed Yu at the Weicheng Silk Factory forcibly shut down the machines at 5 PM, rendering it impossible for everyone to work. On the 19th, Yu (a director of the labor union) did not come to work at the factory all day. The workers in the factory spontaneously halted work for two days at 4:50 PM, resulting in the loss of one hour's worth of silk cocoons that had already been boiled. On the 20th, the majority of workers at the Weicheng Factory went on strike. When various relevant authorities in Hangzhou intervened, the labor demanded increased wages, but the factory's management indicated they needed the consent of the capital, and no resolution was reached. Today, approximately two to three hundred workers from the Weicheng Factory compelled the cocoon sorting workshop, which had not joined the strike, to halt work, and damaged equipment in the workshop. They then rushed out and went to various factories across the city, forcibly halting work. At the Tianzhang Silk Factory, glass windows were broken and machinery was damaged. By 3 PM, with mediation from the Social Affairs Section and other relevant authorities, work was resumed. At 4 PM, the Social Affairs Section of the Municipal Government convened labor and capital for mediation. Ambassador Stuart took a picture at the Hangzhou office of this newspaper. The upper picture was taken in front of the gate, the lower picture was taken on the lawn (photographed by Huang Xingtian of this newspaper).</p>

<h3 id="e35">Bandit Suppression Completed in Yangcheng Area; Remaining Scattered Bandits Being Cleaned Up, Ring Leaders Being Pursued. <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 21st] Paratroop Commander and concurrently Commanding Officer of Bandit Suppression in the Yangcheng Area, Major General Ma Shigong, recently returned to Suzhou after transferring from Beijing to Shanghai. On the afternoon of the 21st, at approximately 5 PM, he, along with Chief of Staff Colonel Liu Nongnuan, met with this newspaper's special correspondent stationed in Suzhou. He issued a comprehensive statement on the progress of bandit suppression work in the Yangcheng area over the past ten days. A brief record follows: At the beginning of the bandit suppression work in the Yangcheng area, command headquarters were established in the east and west districts of Kunshan and Yu counties, so that responsibility could be divided at each level. After ten days of combined suppression and pacification, considerable results have been achieved. In the south, the bandit leader Li Defu was executed, and most of his subordinates have surrendered. Only a few are scattered, and they can no longer form groups. The two bandit groups of Liu Genbao and Liu Gengui, formerly of the "New Fourth Army," who had roamed in the northern part of Taicang, have now been completely eliminated. However, the bandit leader Liu brothers managed to escape and are currently being pursued. The bandit suppression mission in the Kunshan area can be said to be 80% complete since the collapse of the three bandit groups of Li and Liu. As for the Yu area, the "New Fourth Army" led by Ren Tianshi, formerly based in Meili, and the bandit group led by Zhao Jianping, of the pseudo-Suzhou-Wuxi Border Region County Government, who had roamed in the Huangdai and Dangkou areas at the junction of Suzhou and Wuxi, have all been cleared. The two bandit leaders, Ren Tianshi and Zhao Jianping, barely escaped with their lives and are said to have fled alone to the Yinshan Mountains in Nantong County. The command headquarters has strictly ordered their capture to prevent future troubles. Therefore, the bandit suppression mission in the Yu area can be said to have been completely successful. Regarding the handling of bandits who have surrendered or been arrested, there are more than 600 people in the east and west districts. The government is generous and does not blame the past. Except for a few who have committed heinous crimes and bear blood debts in the area, who should be punished according to the law, the rest are handed over to the cadre training institutes in various counties for education and reform, so that they may still have the opportunity to start anew and serve the country. Mr. Ma also stated firmly that he has decided to inspect Changshu, Jiangyin, Kunshan, Taicang, Jiading, and Baoshan, starting on the 23rd, to inspect the current status of the troops and to promote the completion of the bandit suppression work by the end of October. However, he believes that the completion of bandit suppression is not simply measured by the absence of bandits in the jurisdiction. It should be ensured that bandits have nowhere to flee, either surrendering or being eliminated. Therefore, the completion of bandit suppression in the Yangcheng area depends on whether this principle can be achieved.</p>

<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 21st] The Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Province recently received a secret accusation that the current Wuxi County Magistrate Xu Yuanruo and the Speaker of the Provisional Assembly Jiang Puzhai were involved in corruption and malfeasance, including a major case involving human life.

<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] The total length of the trunk and branch roads in the Zhenjiang urban area is 25 kilometers, and the road surface area is 280,000 square meters. Due to disrepair during the enemy occupation, there was hardly a complete road surface after the victory and return. Through the active repair by the construction authorities, there has been rapid progress so far. The renovated or being renovated road surface is 28,600 square meters. Together with the road surface under construction, it accounts for two-thirds of the total area of the main roads in the city. As for the road surface standards, efforts are being made to improve them compared to the pre-war period to meet the needs of modern urbanization. For example, Daxi Road, the prosperous commercial center of the city, is 2 kilometers long, and asphalt pavement is currently being laid. The project started on September 18 and is being carried out simultaneously in two sections. This is the only asphalt road in Zhenjiang and is scheduled to be completed within the year. In terms of dredging the city's ditches, the section from Daxi Road through Yingjiang Road north to the river pier has been completed, with a length of 400 meters. All horizontal ditches and cellar wells have also been dredged together. The thorough dredging of all ditches on Daxi Road is still underway, and iron covers are being installed on the cellar wells to prevent sewage from stagnating.</p>

<p>[Our Pinghu Dispatch] The councillor election bribery case, which once caused a stir throughout the county, has subsided not long ago, and recently it has been filled with recall petitions.

First, Zhu Jingzhang, chairman of the township council, and ten others filed a complaint with the county government accusing him of bribery. Later, some villagers rose up to request a recall, pointing out that Sun colluded with the township chief, Chuan Zikun, threatened voters, and detained He Tiansheng, who had not obeyed the voting instructions, in Qinglian Temple for intimidation. Sun Wenda had also committed murder in the past and violated criminal law, was deprived of his civil rights, and was addicted to bad habits that he had not quit. After receiving the report, the county government sent people to the township for a thorough investigation. The township representatives issued a certificate proving the facts were accurate.

<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch] Since the establishment of the county tax collection office, a detailed plan has been formulated for the implementation of various tax policies. Director Min Wenwei met with this newspaper's special correspondent stationed in Suzhou to elaborate on the details, which are briefly recorded as follows: (1) Organizational aspect: It is planned to set up branch offices in Fengqiao, Mudu, Huguan, Jiaozhi, Weiting, and Lumu, and tax collection offices in Dongshan and Xishan. (2) Consolidation of the tax system: When the business tax was collected by the direct tax bureau, only the urban area was targeted. Now it is planned to extend it to the rural areas, but efforts will be made to take into account the real environment. For example, stores with strong capital, whether they are sole proprietorships or partnerships, must be handled seriously so that the tax revenue can be abundant and government expenses are not lacking. And for family stores that maintain the minimum living business, there seems to be a need for consideration, so we strive to simplify the procedures, so as to avoid disturbing the people. As for the tax on the use of civilian boats, there are many abuses in between, and it is also a huge disturbance to the people, and it has now been decided to improve it.</p>

<p>[Our Wujin News] Qi Shuyan Power Plant, large scale, has always been well-known, is one of the famous power plants in the country, but since the victory was taken over, for a year, the plant failed to actively reorganize, to expand, only to maintain the status quo, the important needs of local factories, agricultural water conservancy and other aspects of the use of electricity, often many excuses and restrictions, can not cope, all sides on which the sound of trouble, recently suddenly arbitrarily presented to the Ministry of Economic Affairs to collect security deposits, counted in a few days up to two hundred thousand yuan of huge, aroused outside suspicion, Wuxi business community should express resentment, The South Jiangsu Branch of the National Industrial Association of China and the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce jointly presented to the Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner of the Jiang River, requesting a swift rectification to revoke the Qi plant's collection of security deposits, and to send personnel to thoroughly investigate the abuses, which is briefly stated:</p>
<p>Expensive Electricity; Difficult Connection</p>
<p>Check the Qi Shuyan Power Plant issued Announcement No. 17, collecting meter deposits, electricity security deposits and various miscellaneous fees, the electricity lighting users security deposit part, calculated according to the meter capacity, the highest is up to 120,000 yuan, the lowest is 3,000 yuan, the electricity security deposit part of electricity users, one and a half months to two months the highest electricity amount as a principle, the number is huge, the purpose is unknown. Check the Qi plant's daily power generation, in more than 230,000 degrees, monthly total of more than 7 million degrees, meter reading day users more than 5 million degrees, intangible losses and waste unused as more than 2 million degrees, lighting users account for 11%, electricity users account for 89%, Wuxi two places, electricity per degree from 231 yuan to 377 yuan, several times higher than Shanghai, this increase in electricity security deposit, than the original paid security deposit increased more than 30 times, the number reached more than 200,000 yuan of huge, intangible freezing part of the funds of the industry and commerce. According to the Qi plant's supply of electricity to the industry and commerce, often lack of coal, full load and other words, many excuses, and the outside world's leisurely mouth, many according to the charter reported to be connected, so far only to keep the corner, trying to figure out the latter can actually wish, so there are millions of connections to the three-horsepower. In order to seek the truth, the association once sent an electrical letter to the Economic Department with letter number 149 on August 16, ordering the Qi plant. The association sent an electrical letter to the Economic Department with letter number 149 on August 16, ordering the Qi plant to list in detail the motor users who have been supplied and the date of reporting to be connected, so as to remove doubts in the case, but so far the plant has not replied with the double letter, which is enough to prove that the plant's actions are quite unable to block the leisurely mouth.</p>
<p>With Surplus, Near Harassment</p>
<p>And Qi factory police business, not seen a loss, there is a surplus, there is no need to collect this item to hire a large amount of funds. The so-called collection of security deposits of the day, purely to prevent arrears, and Qi plant on the user arrears, there is an immediate cut-off line of strict regulations, since there is no need to collect this security deposit, if it is said that this approach is based on the handling of the Shanghai City, then the Shanghai City lighting electricity, each degree is only 73 yuan, Tin Wu two places users bear, more than two times more, Shanghai City to coal easy electricity power, electricity per degree is only 200 yuan, Wu Tin two places bear nearly two times, in the electricity rate standard is not consistent, how can arbitrarily cited. This time without soliciting local public opinion, only the private opinion of a few people in the plant, please the Ministry of Economic Affairs to approve it, it is not accepted by all users, at this time of industrial and commercial difficulties, the government to help not spare any effort, the measures of public utilities, should be closely related to people's livelihood, the government for transport and telecommunications and other businesses, in order to take into account the people's livelihood difficulties, do not hesitate to subsidize policies, in order to promote price stability, deaf plant in the end is state-owned, or private, although its nature is still unclear, but on the government's established policy, seems not to be contrary to each other, the association and other sent to the subordinate members of the appeal, the power plant to collect security deposits, all feel near hate, increase industrial and commercial burden, ten thousand difficult to admit, this help industry and commerce of the , swift, revoking the main cases, to lighten the burden on users, and to send personnel to thoroughly investigate the above said factory, to maintain law and order and benefit the people, etc.</p>

<p>[Our Bengbu News] Since the Yellow River flooded eastward this summer, the Huai River dike restoration project has been greatly affected. Currently, the up and down Huai River is surging, and construction is still difficult. According to the person in charge of the Huai River Water Conservancy Project Bureau, the Huai River dike restoration project was originally carried out in sections. Now, due to the autumn floods, the water level rises and falls from time to time, and it will not be possible to officially cultivate it until the low water period in winter. In order to prepare for dredging the riverbed, the Bureau is now assigning technicians to measure the water level and flow along the river to understand the dynamics of the Huai River. Five dredgers, the main tools for dredging the riverbed, have been allocated by the Huai River Guidance Committee and have been gradually driven from Shanghai. They must be transferred to the Zhenjiang Canal via Hongze Lake and then driven into the Huai River to carry out dredging to remove silt. It is also said that Shen Baixian, Deputy Director of the Huai River Guidance Committee, will fly to Huayuankou in the coming days to inspect the Yellow River damming project and limit the completion of the damming work within this year.</p>

<p>[Our Wuhu Dispatch, 21st] The Jingwu and Wutun road bus robbery cases have occurred three times in a week. It is estimated that two passenger cars near Dangtu were robbed on the evening of the 12th, with a loss of 8 million yuan.

<p>Our fellow townsmen from eastern Zhejiang, residing in Shanghai, account for the largest proportion of people from other provinces. Before the war of resistance, transportation between Shanghai and Zhejiang was very convenient. To places such as Zhenhai, Yin County, Xiangshan, Fenghua, Cixi, Yuyao, Shanglu, etc., one could take a Shanghai-Ningbo line ferry at four or five in the afternoon and arrive in their respective hometowns the next day. Because Ningbo's transportation facilities were complete at that time, such as the Ningbo-Cao'e section railway train, the long-distance buses on the Yin-Zhen-Ci-Guan-Cao section highway, and the small steamships sailing to various places, it was truly very convenient. Moreover, it was both economical in terms of money and time.</p>
<p>During the enemy-puppet period, after eastern Zhejiang fell into enemy hands, all transportation ports were blockaded by the enemy. Sometimes there might be Shanghai-Ningbo line ferries running, but because Ningbo's transportation facilities were destroyed, passengers going to places like Yuyao and Shangyu had to spend three or four days to get home. Moreover, the trouble of purchasing boat tickets, the strict queueing and luggage inspection when boarding, those who have experienced this will never forget it. If the ferries were not running, then we could only take sailboats, but we had to first go to Caojing</p>
<p>(a coastal area under the jurisdiction of Songjiang County) and then take a sailboat to the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang. These sailboats were mostly used for carrying goods, so they were extremely dirty, and there were many dangers, with frequent incidents of capsizing and sinking.</p>
<p>Since the victory, all transportation ports have been fully opened, which everyone is very happy about. Although the Shanghai-Ningbo line has regular ferries run by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the scope of passengers included is not broad, mostly Ningbo passengers. Because Ningbo's transportation facilities were destroyed during the war, passengers going to places like Yuyao and Shangyu even have to spend the night in transit. Due to the inconveniences mentioned above, they abandoned the Shanghai-Ningbo line ferries and instead took the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway train to Hangzhou, crossed the Qiantang River, and took the Qiane Highway (Qiantang River to Cao'e) long-distance bus to Cao'e, and then dispersed to their respective destinations. According to the current schedule of the two railway bureaus for the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, the first train to depart is the special express at 6:45 am, arriving in Hangzhou at 11:30 am. After crossing the Qiantang River to the bus station to catch a bus, it is already 1 or 2 pm, and by the time they arrive in Cao'e, it is already past 5 pm. If they then hire a boat on the Cao'e River in Baiguan, or walk thirty or forty li, then it is not feasible. Because the local areas in the countryside are not peaceful, and incidents of robbery and banditry occur from time to time, they must spend the night in Baiguan and only arrive home the next day. This is too uneconomical in terms of money and time, especially for small clerks in our salaried class. For the sake of the above-mentioned hardships, I would like to ask the two railway bureaus to add a Shanghai-Hangzhou line night train (slow train), preferably departing at 12 midnight and arriving in Hangzhou at 6:30 am in the morning. Then our fellow townsmen from Ningbo and Shaoxing can all arrive home on the same day, without having to spend the night in transit. Not only can money be saved, but also a lot of time. I wonder if the authorities of the two railways can do this?</p>

<p>Finalizing Street Names and House Numbers Throughout the City</p>
<p>Since the Japanese puppet era, most of the street names in Shanghai have been changed, and the old iron street signs have been removed, which is very inconvenient for memory. After the victory, our government has renamed the streets again. Except for a few important and well-known roads that have clear signs, many small roads and stone roads in Nanshi, Hongkou, and western Shanghai, especially at the corners of major roads, have no street signs and the house numbers also lack a definite standard, which makes it impossible for citizens to find their way! For example, North Sichuan Road, Qiujiang Road, Xingjiaqiao Road, etc. in Shanghai, these roads are quite famous, but without street signs, everyone still knows them. The house numbers on North Sichuan Road also have two colors, blue and white, which may not be a problem for those who have been in Shanghai for a long time, but it is indeed difficult for fellow countrymen who have just arrived in Shanghai to identify them. I sincerely hope that the municipal authorities will finalize the house numbers throughout the city in the near future, and then put up street signs, so as to facilitate the citizens and provide public convenience.

<p>Reply to Lu Zhaojun: Regarding the appeal for students of Chongqing Normal School, we have received a reply from the Ministry of Education stating: "Upon investigation, the Ministry's Instruction No. 20697 in mid-April of this year stipulates that 'All teachers and students should return to their original hometowns.' Therefore, students of Chongqing Normal School from Sichuan cannot come to Beijing to study. Furthermore, this school is to be handed over to the province for management, and the Sichuan Education Department has been repeatedly instructed by telegram to take over the school and report on the progress as soon as possible. Recently, due to the Sichuan Education Department's delay in taking over the school, emergency measures have been taken and the National Jiangjin Normal School has been instructed by telegram to continue operating the school. By the end of this year, it will accommodate teachers, staff, and students of Sichuan origin from the school, as well as the National Chengda Labor Education Children's Army Girls' Normal School, and students from national normal schools stranded in Chongqing who are returning to their hometowns, and instructions have been issued to comply with this."

In the 26th year, he joined the Shanghai Professional Youth Salvation Service Corps. When the National Army withdrew westward, the Corps announced its dissolution. In the winter of the 27th year, he joined the Communist Party. At the end of March of the 29th year, he was sent to work in Wuxi, initially as the secretary of the Xinan District Committee, and later promoted to the Minister of Organization of the Communist Party Wuxi County Committee.

<h3 id="e56">Content of Turkey's Reply to the Soviet Union Announced; Turkey Firmly Rejects Co-Management of the Dardanelles; Agrees to Revise Convention with Three Suggestions; Does Not Acknowledge Responsibility for Wartime Breach of the Convention <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, 21st] Turkey has firmly rejected the Soviet Union's second request for co-management of the Dardanelles Strait. The content of the reply has now been released, in which Turkey denies the Soviet Union's accusations regarding German ships passing through the Strait during the war, and states that if the Soviet government persists, Turkey will only submit the matter to international arbitration. Turkey hereby makes the following suggestions: (1) Revise the Montreux Convention regarding the passage of ships of various countries through the Strait, (2) Replace all references to the "League of Nations" in the Convention with "United Nations Organization," (3) Remove Japan's name from the list of signatory countries and replace it with the United States.</p>
<p>The note continued that the Turkish government agreed to revise the Convention, but could not acknowledge responsibility for violating it during the war. As for the fourth item in the Soviet note, namely that the Black Sea littoral states should be solely responsible for concluding a new convention, the Turkish government believes that this Soviet claim is inconsistent with international law, because the Black Sea and the Turkish Straits issue cannot be regarded as solely related to the Black Sea littoral states, as expressly stipulated in international law. The Black Sea cannot be considered a closed sea. The Soviet Union's request for co-management of the Strait is difficult to agree to, because this action would not allow Turkey to share sovereignty with a foreign country. What is tolerable if this is not? If the Strait is attacked in the future, the Soviet Union can take the best solution, that is, mix the national defense forces with the United Nations guards and be responsible for stopping the aggression. The Soviet Union disregards Turkish sovereignty and wants to force it to submit. It is not known what its intentions are. If it is said that Turkey's rejection of this request will damage the Soviet Union's prestige, it is also unreasonable. According to the Turkish government's view, Turkey's honor, prestige, and survival are in imminent danger. The Soviet Union accused Turkey of obtaining the consent of certain foreign countries to take various military measures in the Strait. This statement is completely unfounded. In short, Turkey's acceptance to participate in the treaty revision negotiations proves that we have sincerity. This negotiation is already prepared and can be held at any time.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Three Ways to Resolve the Issue; No Room for Separate Negotiations Between the Soviet Union and Turkey <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, 21st] Turkey's reply to the Soviet Union has a cold tone, and its firm rejection of all Soviet demands is almost certain. There is no room for separate negotiations between the Soviet Union and Turkey. As for the three points suggested by Turkey to revise the Montreux Convention, all are technical issues and of no great importance. Political observers believe that future developments can take three paths: (1) The Strait issue is shelved indefinitely; (2) The Soviet Union withdraws its demands, and at the same time, the international conference is successfully convened; (3) The Soviet Union uses force to resolve the issue with Turkey. In short, no matter how the situation evolves, Turkey has adopted a final attitude, and this attitude has almost obtained the consent of Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Turkish Capital, 20th] Regarding the Dardanelles Strait issue, Professor Huwei Oulin of Turkish diplomatic affairs recently published an article in a newspaper commenting that the exchange of notes between the Soviet Union and Turkey is tantamount to direct negotiations between the two countries, but it is not easy to make this negotiation consistent with the Montreux Convention. If the Soviet Union insists on its demands, it would be best to convene a meeting of the signatory countries to the Montreux Convention. Diplomatic officials here believe that Britain may initiate this meeting, but Turkey itself will not take this action. In any case, Turkey will have other countries convene this meeting.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] "Pravda" today carried an article by Saslavsky, stating that Turkey's reply to the Soviet Union shows that it is a Turkish steamed bun with Anglo-American filling.

Regarding the trusteeship issue, the opinions of State Department officials and Army and Navy officials are still quite divided. General officials in the State Department support giving as much as possible the former Japanese and Japanese-mandated islands in the Pacific to the United Nations Organization for trusteeship. The Army and Navy want to keep all the islands necessary for the United States' security under the sole management of the United States. Burns is now working hard to reach an agreement as soon as possible, so that the US delegation can put forward concrete proposals when the United Nations Organization's Trusteeship Council is established soon.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 21st] MacArthur released his August report on the administration of occupied Japan today, announcing that the Japanese government had dismissed 186,000 militaristic soldiers in the past year; but only 331 of the 15,992 teachers and educators who were reported were prohibited from teaching. The Ministry of Education is responsible for the cleansing work in the education sector.</p>
<p>This issue's report reflects the rising cost of living, with some price indices jumping from two to seven times. National debt increased to 220 billion yen. In the 20 days since the end of July, the amount of banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan increased to more than 5 billion yen. Although production figures have improved, the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare reported that 6.8 million people will be unemployed by the end of this year.

<p>[Our Report] Paris Radio, 21st: New Delhi Dispatch: Indian Interim Government Prime Minister Nehru and Abdul Ghaffar Khan, known as "Frontier Gandhi," were both attacked and wounded in a hostile demonstration today, but their injuries are not serious.</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 21st] After inspecting the troubled areas of Bengal Province, Congress Party Chairman Kripalani said in Calcutta today: Moslem looting, arson, murder, forced conversion, and abduction of women, forced marriage, etc., have been confirmed by Hindu refugees. In Tipbera alone, there are already 40,000 refugees, and the total number of deaths and injuries cannot be counted because the troubled areas are isolated from the outside world and cannot be penetrated. The instigating leaders are retired soldiers, using military methods to attack.</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 20th] The Hindu-Moslem conflict in eastern Bengal is likely to cause a crisis in the nascent interim government, or even lead to retaliatory actions in other parts of India. Criticism is directed at Indian Governor-General Wavell and Bengal Governor Bruce, blaming them for failing to take effective measures in the troubled areas to protect the Hindu population, which is only one-fifth of the Moslem population. This is the third time Nehru has been attacked on his tour. Indian Governor-General Wavell has flown to New Delhi by special plane after a three-day visit to Bombay.</p>
<p>[United Press, Calcutta, 20th] Bengal Premier Suhrawardy stated: Indian volunteers are heading to the Noakhali district in large numbers to rescue distressed women. The affected area of Noakhali is located at the northern tip of the Bay of Bengal. Moslems in the area, in partnership with bandits, began attacking the Hindu minority on the 20th of this month. The political motives behind this move are difficult to fathom; however, both Hindu and Moslem sides admit that the Moslems initiated the conflict.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Municipal Cultural Construction Committee Holds Grand Peking Opera Performance to Celebrate Birthday; Proceeds from Ticket Sales to Fund School and Other Foundations <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai Southern Party Headquarters Cultural Movement Committee, in celebration of the Chairman's sixtieth birthday, has initiated a grand gathering of famous Peking Opera actors on the afternoon of the Chairman's birthday (the 31st of this month) at the Tianchan Theater, with the remaining proceeds from ticket sales to be used as cultural awards. Yesterday, the committee held a reception at the Kangle Restaurant for the city's cultural circles. Present were Pan Gongzhan, Chairman of the committee, Fang Zhi, Chairman of the City Party Headquarters, Vice-Speaker Xu Ji, Ouyang Zunquan, Chief of General Affairs of the Municipal Government representing Mayor Wu, as well as Wang Xiaolai, Liu Gongyun, Gu Chunfan, Director of the Finance Bureau, Li Mou, Deputy Director of the Education Bureau, Feng Youzhen, famous Peking Opera actors Zhou Xinfang, Jiang Miaoxiang, Ye Shengian, famous amateur singer Sun Lantian, and others, totaling forty people. Chairman Pan presided over the meeting, reporting that the Cultural Movement Committee has had close ties with the city's education, drama, news, and art circles, but has not used its name to make any external representations. This grand Peking Opera performance to celebrate the Chairman's sixtieth birthday is actually initiated and voluntarily performed by the Peking Opera circles. The ticket revenue, after deducting some necessary backstage expenses, will be used to fund schools. If there is a surplus, it will be used to establish a Zhongzheng Cultural Fund, with a management committee to categorize and set fixed amounts, only using the interest and not the principal. This award includes fine arts, sculpture, drama, art works, etc., and the first to be planned is a fund to improve Peking Opera. Ticket prices for the performance range from 4,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan, with 50 to 100 honorary seats available at 100,000 yuan per ticket, hoping that the industrial and commercial sectors will promote it. Finance Bureau Director Gu has agreed to waive donations, as this performance is held in the afternoon and is not within the scope of the Finance Bureau's budget, and this will not be followed as an example in the future.</p>
<p>Chairman Fang Zhi then stated that the Chairman has repeatedly instructed not to take any action, and the city's circles deeply admire the Chairman's good intentions. However, from the standpoint of the people, they should express their gratitude to the hardworking and meritorious Chairman, and donating to schools to celebrate his birthday has profound significance. After this Peking Opera performance, it is hoped that it will continue to develop and promote China's inherent art and promote the national essence internationally. The City Party Headquarters will always assist all sectors as much as possible.</p>
<p>Ouyang Zunquan, representing the Mayor, expressed his strong support for the Peking Opera circles celebrating the birthday and hoped that they would work hard to promote it. Zhou Xinfang said that the Peking Opera colleagues can only do their best to express their respect to the Chairman. It is of great significance that any surplus ticket revenue will be used for cultural awards. The improvement of Peking Opera originated in the early years of the Republic of China. Today, spoken drama has made progress, while Peking Opera still has feudal colors, and the improvement is urgently needed.</p>
<p>Finally, Wang Xiaolai stated that he hopes to promote cultural movements and not stop after this birthday celebration, but to continue to develop. Deputy Director Li of the Education Bureau also gave instructions on the promotion of culture and education.</p>
<p>Performance Program</p>
<p>Regarding the grand Peking Opera performance, it has been decided to hold it at the Tianchan Theater from 12:00 noon to 6:00 pm on the 31st of this month.

<h3 id="e90">The Entire Lengths of the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Highways Are Being Actively Repaired; It Is Expected That Both Will Be Open to Traffic in November and Are Planned to Be Reconstructed as [Super] Highways <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The two major highways, Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou, are currently being actively repaired by the Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. It is expected that the entire line of the Nanjing-Shanghai Road will be open to traffic in mid-November, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road will be open to traffic at the end of November. During the Anti-Japanese War, the roadbeds of these two major highways were almost completely destroyed. After strenuous repairs after the victory, the Xihu section of the Nanjing-Shanghai Road and the Hangjia section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road can now be traveled on.</p>
<p>Asphalt Pavement</p>
<p>The Highway Bureau also plans to rebuild these two lines into "super" highways. Specific plans have already been drafted and are awaiting the final decision of the authorities. This "super" highway will not use cement but asphalt pavement, because although cement is more durable, its price is more than double that of asphalt. Based on current market prices, asphalt roads cost between 20,000 and 30,000 National Currency per square meter. The construction of the "super" highway will be a joint effort between the Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and the Municipal Government Public Works Bureau, because more than 13 kilometers of the Nanjing-Shanghai Road and more than 7 kilometers of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road are within the city limits. At that time, the Municipal Government plans to petition the Central Government for subsidies to help with road repair costs.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Since Mayor Wu concurrently served as the director of the Textile Industry Management Committee, he has been discussing various policies to stabilize cotton cloth and suppress commodity prices for days. It is said that specific decisions have been made.

<p>Also, the Nanjing-Hangzhou National Highway has already been fully opened to traffic, but after the heavy rains a month ago, the Yixing to Liyang section of the road was damaged by flooding and is now being rushed to repair it. It is expected to be open to traffic again by the end of the month.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to strengthen the Southeast transportation system, the Highway Bureau is building the following road lines: (1) Shanghai to Zhitang Line (via Liuhe, Taicang), (2) Hangzhou to Shangyu Line (goods combined transportation with Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway), (3) Nanjing to Luhe Line (via Wuhu, ), (4) Hefei to Yuhan Line (via Shuijiahu), (5) Nanton to Yantan Line, etc.</p>

<p>At present, the Tenth Transportation Office of the Highway Bureau has 50 passenger cars and 200 trucks, which are operating on various lines, but are not sufficient. It is learned that the office has signed a contract with the Materials Supply Bureau. A large number of vehicles will arrive in Shanghai in the short term. As for the rumor that highway transportation costs will increase soon, the person in charge of the office said: Except for the Shanghai-Taicang Highway, the fare includes road repair fees due to road damage, but the office has not considered increasing prices so far.</p>

<p>At about 10:00 pm on the 20th, three people in uniform and three people in plain clothes suddenly arrived at the Wanshunfeng Rice Shop at No. 84 Ninghaixi Road, hired a Jili Transportation Company truck in advance, and without asking why, pulled out their guns, broke into the shop, and robbed all 30 loads of rice, 160 pairs of leather shoes, and one radio, as counted and fled. Later, the shop owner Zhao Xuewen reported to the Taishan Branch, and the director immediately ordered Zhang Rou, the director of the judicial section, to supervise all the plainclothes police officers and work with the military police to drive to No. 25 Sanxin Lane, North Sichuan Road, based on clues, and arrested He Bangduo, who impersonated a soldier. He then continued to No. 32 Peideri, Datong Road, and obtained Ma Jiliang, Xu Guobiao, Yang Shaobing, etc., and found</p>
<p>all the stolen goods. He then went to the Zhonghua Department Store at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road and obtained suspect Song Wenqing, etc., and brought them all to the police station for questioning. According to the plaintiff Zhao Xuewen: Yu's brother Zhao Wanshun was working as an accountant at the Zhonghua Department Store. Recently, he borrowed a huge amount of 100 million yuan at high interest from colleagues to do speculative business, and issued two checks from the Guohua Bank. Later, because his brother was unable to pay, he left without saying goodbye, and there has been no news for many days. On the 14th, he received a suicide note from his brother, and it is not known whether he has committed suicide. Unexpectedly, today Song Wenqing, an employee of the Zhonghua Department Store, led four people in uniform and carrying guns to rob the rice and other items. Song Wenqing said: I am a colleague of Zhao Wanshun. Zhao had asked me to borrow a large amount of money from my friend Ma Jiliang. When the due date arrived, he ignored it and fled privately. I have not seen him for many days and sent a suicide note, so I notified Ma Jiliang, who invited many people to move the goods. Ma Jiliang confessed: I have no occupation and rely on lending for a living. I was introduced by Song Wenqing to raise millions of yuan to lend to Zhao Wanshun. When the due date arrived, he did not return it and fled. I heard the news and was anxious. I discussed it with my relative He Bangduo and drove a car to the rice shop set up by Zhao to take the rice to make up for the debt. He Bangduo said that I am a retired soldier. I was introduced by Ma Jiliang to lend Zhao Wanshun 2 million yuan. Now Zhao has fled and there is no trace, so I was anxious and went to his shop to move the goods. Xu Guoliang, Yang Shaobing, and others confessed that they were invited by Ma Jiliang to move the rice, and first transported the truck to San口, North Sichuan Road, and then hired a Bingan Transportation Company truck to transport it to No. 32 Peideri, Datong Road, for storage. The director ordered them to be detained and await the recording of confessions to be sent to the Prosecutor's Office for investigation.</p>

<p>[Our Report] At about 8:00 am the day before yesterday, the Yulin Road Police Station received a tip that there were privately hidden firearms at No. 234 Wangjiazhai, Jiangjiabang West, Qiqihar Road, Yangshupu. The plainclothes patrol officer Fang Dingsan was dispatched to the house, and a Japanese-style Type 94 pistol, 11 bullets, and one magazine were found on the roof of the thatched shed in the stove room. Thirty-six machine gun shell casings were found under the slab beside the front door. Zhang Liansheng (26 years old) and Liu Xuecheng (28 years old) from Shandong were arrested on the spot and taken to the station for interrogation. Zhang Yingsheng confessed to hiding the firearms. However, Liu Xuecheng confessed to a murder case. It turned out that Gu Dayingzi coveted the beauty of Zhang Jinhong (21 years old, from Nantong), a young woman at No. 64 Weixin Lane, Pingliang Road, and intended to act improperly. Because he was hindered by her mother-in-law, Wu Yu氏, he could not succeed. At about 2:00 am on May 26, Gu Dalianzi colluded with Liu Xuecheng and Jiang Jinfa to go to Wu Yu氏's house and rob her of a gold ring. At that time, Wu Yu氏 grabbed Liu Xuecheng and would not let go. Liu took out a knife and stabbed her eight times, leaving her dying. Her son, Yinfat踏, who made a living by driving a tricycle, was fast asleep and jumped out of bed to pursue the sound, and was also stabbed by Gu Dalianzi. Gu and others fled without a trace. Mother and son were injured and were sent to the hospital for treatment. The old woman Wu Yu氏 eventually died of her injuries. The police station is pursuing Gu Dalianzi and Jiang Jinfa, and the interrogation of Zhang Liansheng and Liu Xuecheng has been completed. It will be sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and handling in the near future.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The major robbery that occurred at the Asia Money Exchange at No. 818 North Sichuan Road at 2:00 PM on the 23rd of last month has been solved as a result of diligent investigation by the police. The ringleader is a seasoned thief with 30 years of "experience," named Chen Xianglin from Pudong. He is not only able to fire guns with both hands, but also able to load bullets with one hand. Therefore, he carried as many as three firearms when committing the robbery. Before the robbery, he and his accomplices planned it at the Bund Park. During the robbery, they followed a plan to lure employees into an inner room, then assigned one thief to sit guard at the counter, pretending to be a staff member, to prevent passersby from suspecting anything. This allowed them to search and loot at will. Before leaving, they fired a shot as a warning. After the incident, Director Xuan was extremely angry and ordered his subordinates to solve the case. On the 14th of this month, the North Railway Station Police Branch received a tip-off and arrested one of his accomplices, Tang Asan from Changshu, at No. 51 Gaohouli, Tiantong Road. He confessed to having committed five crimes, the last of which was the Asia Money Exchange robbery. Subsequently, the police station arrested the ringleader at the same location. However, the ringleader maintained a "heroic" posture at the police station and refused to disclose the whereabouts of his accomplices. He only confessed that he had been robbing for thirty years, had been imprisoned twice, and each time sentenced to fifteen years, before being released after the victory [of the war]. The police station then received a report that his accomplices were hiding somewhere in Dachang. They rushed there immediately, but the accomplices had already fled an hour before the police arrived, having gotten wind of the news. On the 19th, the police station received another report that they had fled to Suzhou. They immediately dispatched plainclothes chief detective Zhang Shide and other officers to investigate the Mudu area of Suzhou. As of yesterday, there were still no leads. However, the names of the accomplices are known to be Ji Guoliang, Tao Guoliang, Guo Bing, Yu Lin, and four others. The two arrested criminals will be sent to the Preparatory Department for interrogation in accordance with the law within the next few days.</p>

<h3 id="e106">The Inside Story of Shanghai's Pickpocketing Gangs (II) <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jiamo</p>
<p>Agility and Alertness Essential for Success</p>
<p>In order to ensure a "constant stream of talent," the pickpocketing gangs have a variety of methods for stealing money. The most promising group is called "Eating Rice," which is a general term for the various techniques that directly harm our citizens. I will first describe the organization and activities of the "Eating Rice" group, and then discuss the other gangs later. "Eating Rice" is gang slang for "eating improper food." Although there are many routes of activity, in a nutshell, it is nothing more than "stealing and deception." The "outlaws" who "join" the "Eating Rice" gang are all well-groomed and neatly dressed. Since this gang engages in illegal activities, it is most likely to be caught. Therefore, they must be agile and alert to be successful. In gang slang, this is called "Linglongzi Dancing Yao."</p>
<p>Those who engage in "eating bad rice" must apprentice and join the gang. The master is the "Grand Uncle Team" in each area. The position of the "Grand Uncle" is like a director in a theater troupe, who must have the "eye for talent." After making a decision, they instruct them to learn various specialized pickpocketing techniques, divided into categories, like choosing elective courses in college. Once they graduate, they can go out and "face the world."</p>
<p>The most promising activity in the "eating bad rice" gang is "hard pickpocketing," which means forceful snatching. This group has the largest number of members and the most important distribution areas. Since the introduction of European customs, women in the city must carry handbags when they go out. The "hard pickpocketing" brothers regard snatching these handbags as their most proud masterpiece. They work in groups of two or three, and must first observe the situation before striking. After snatching on the road, they hand it over to gang members who run wildly into the dark alleys and disappear in an instant. If it is a dark and secluded road, weak women cannot resist, making it even easier to strike. However, if the police force is strong in the bustling city, or there are many pedestrians, they dare not act rashly. However, this trend has not been popular for many years, because many women only carry the appearance, and the handbags contain very limited cash. Even if they sell the old handbags, they are not worth much. Therefore, they have shifted their attention to various women's accessories. It turns out that the "hard pickpocketing" gang has the ability to identify gold jewelry, so they will never snatch fake jewelry. They have established the following slang for gold jewelry:</p>
<p>Original Name</p>
<p>Slang</p>
<p>Gold Bracelet Cuff</p>
<p>Dig Ear Garlic</p>
<p>Earring Canopy</p>

<h3 id="e107">Friends of the Military Society Launches Membership Drive <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Since its relocation from Chongqing to Shanghai after last year's victory, the Friends of the Military Society has spared no effort in serving soldiers and promoting cooperation between the military and civilians, leaving a good impression on both sides. Last night at 7:00 PM, the society held a banquet at the Friends of the Military Club on Zhapu Road to welcome figures from the Party, government, military, business, and society, and reported on the society's business and future plans. Over fifty people were in attendance including Commander Tang Enbo, Mayor Wu Guozhen, Commander Xuan Tiewu, Committee Director Fang Zhi, Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Inspector Cheng Zhongxing, as well as He Yaozu, Du Yuesheng, Wu Shaoshu, He Dequi, Liu Gongyun, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jizhuang, Fan Shaozeng, Xu Jiguan, Gu Jiatang, Feng Youzhen, Qin Runqing, Liu Hongsheng, Hu Xiyuan, Wang Zhixin, Shu Yunzhang, Rong Hongyuan, Jin Runxiang, Yu Shuping, Xie Renzhao, Yang Guanbei, Yang Jizhang, and Hu Jingru. The event was a great success. After taking their seats, Liu Deming, the president of the society, first reported on the founding of the Friends of the Military Society and a summary of its business since its relocation to Shanghai last year. He also expressed that in order to expand the Friends of the Military movement, he plans to launch a membership drive and asks for assistance from all sectors. Commander Tang then delivered a speech, followed by a speech by Fang Xikong, director of the Municipal Party Department, who stated: "The saying that the military and civilians are united as one" is often seen in slogans, but rarely in reality. During the Northern Expedition, I was responsible for the political work of the army. The people endured hardships and supported the injured, and the hospitality of the people towards the Northern Expeditionary Army was sincere and moving. The reason for this was that the people deeply knew that the purpose of the Northern Expedition was to eliminate the warlords and achieve revolution. This is an example of military-civilian friendship and cooperation before the establishment of the Friends of the Military Society. During the War of Resistance, military-civilian cooperation had improved, but I firmly believe that if the Friends of the Military Society could have been established earlier, it would have reduced some misunderstandings and troubles between the military and civilians and made a significant contribution to the War of Resistance. The task of reorganizing the army and building the country in the future is arduous. I hope that the Friends of the Military movement will be carried forward to fulfill its mission. Speaker Pan Gongzhan then delivered a speech, stating: The Friends of the Military Society has been established in Shanghai for a year and has achieved remarkable results. With the advocacy and support of the Party Department and all sectors in the future, its future development will be considerable. I firmly believe that in another year, the Friends of the Military movement will be widely launched, and its gains can be imagined. Inspector Cheng Zhongxing then delivered a speech, stating: I have always advocated caring for soldiers, repaying soldiers, and serving soldiers. The purpose and mission of the Friends of the Military Society are exactly the same. In the future, I will often use the power of public opinion to help realize this ideal, but how to proceed is still under planning, in order to gain widespread support. I believe that the organization of the Youth Association and its methods of soliciting members can be used as a reference. Under the call of the Friends of the Military movement in the future, any topic proposed by the society, whether it is soliciting members or raising funds, will be fully committed to promoting its success. Commander Xuan Tiewu then delivered a speech, stating: Standing in the position of a soldier, I am very grateful for the hospitality and service of the Friends of the Military Society. The Friends of the Military Society has heavy responsibilities and the work is not easy. In the future, under the guidance and assistance of the leaders, there are great hopes for the development of the work. I am currently serving in the military in Shanghai. I firmly believe that the Friends of the Military Society's service and help to the military can also reduce many difficulties for me. Since Du Yuesheng has not recovered his strength, Chairman Xu of the Chamber of Commerce delivered a speech on his behalf, stating: I am deeply moved to be here today. Before the September 18th Incident, the Japanese entertained the banking community in this house. Coming back here today, I feel both emotional and happy. I believe that the work of the Friends of the Military Society is very meaningful. In the past, Zeng Guofan governed with the principle of not disturbing the people. Commander Tang not only does not disturb the people, but also strives to promote the military as friends of the people. Last year, when the Japanese surrendered, Commander Tang was the first to arrive in Shanghai. All Shanghai merchants were grateful for his kindness. Today, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Commander Tang on behalf of Mr. Du Yuesheng. In the future, the relationship between the military and civilians will become closer. I hope everyone will support the Friends of the Military movement and expand it. Later, Speaker Pan and Du Yuesheng proposed to launch a membership drive for the Friends of the Military Society and organize a Friends of the Military Society Membership Drive Committee. All those present were standing committee members. They drafted a plan and proceeded in teams.

<h3 id="e108">Railway Corruption Case Nearing Verdict; Railway Bureau Sends Another Letter to the District Court Providing Key Reference Points; Yu Xiangyan, Third Secretary of the Bureau, Entirely Fabricated Facts; Shop Commissions Come from the Customer's Pocket; Benefits Gained by Offenders are Losses to the Public <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The corruption case at the Materials Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway is scheduled for sentencing on the morning of the 24th, after two trials and closing arguments concluded at the District Court. The Railway Bureau again sent a letter to the District Court yesterday, detailing the entire case process to provide as a reference. An excerpt of the original text follows: We respectfully inform you that in the embezzlement case of our Bureau's Materials Department, after the first court hearing by your esteemed Court on September 20th of this year, due to the defendants' deceptive and largely untrue statements, we submitted a letter on October 2nd regarding the internal personnel and handling of embezzlement cases for your consideration. Subsequently, on the 17th of this month, during the second hearing by your esteemed Court, our Bureau again sent personnel to observe and record the defendants' testimonies on-site. We found that the testimonies of key individuals were inconsistent and largely inaccurate. Therefore, we are submitting a supplementary statement to your esteemed Court for consideration. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding Zhang Hongtu's portion</p>
<p>(A) Zhang Hongtu's testimony in court again involved Zhang Bokang's background and his relationship with him. It is important to note that both Zhang Honggang and Zhang Bokang were staff members of the Materials Department of the Ministry of Transportation before holding positions in our Bureau. Prior to my being ordered to take over the Beijing-Shanghai area last year, I had no personal acquaintance with either of them. Zhang Bokang was assigned by the Ministry as an accompanying staff member for the takeover, and Zhang Honggang was assigned by the Ministry as the head of the Materials Department. Zhang Bokang's assignment as the head of the Purchasing Section was at the request of Zhang Honggang. This shows that Zhang Honggang's claim that Zhang Bokang was brought by me and was not his personal associate is not true. As for the matter of replacing Zhang Bokang, I had decided to replace him around April due to rumors about the Materials Department both inside and outside the Bureau. I repeatedly asked fair-minded individuals with positions in political circles, such as Shen Yi, Yin Zhongrong, and Zhang Ziguan, to recommend potential replacements. Before the case was exposed, I had informed Zhang Hongtu of my intention to replace Zhang Bokang. Knowing that I was determined to replace Zhang Bokang, he soon introduced another person in an attempt to cover up the issue. By this time, rumors of Zhang Honggang's illegal activities had already spread, so of course I did not consider the person he recommended. The detailed process is also described in our Bureau's letter to your esteemed Court on October 2nd, which shows that Zhang Honggang's claim that he suggested replacing the person, but I refused, is a clear distortion of the facts.</p>
<p>(B) Zhang Honggang also testified: "The testimony I gave last time (referring to the first court hearing testimony) is completely different from today. I want to overturn the second testimony. The testimony about the Railway Bureau is completely wrong. Director Chen changed my testimony. Director Chen should be responsible for this." It is important to note that Zhang Honggang's first hearing was questioned openly by the presiding judge of your esteemed court. His testimony, freely given, was as clear as the sun and stars. Yet, he dares to use excuses to overturn it, which shows the inconsistency of his testimony. According to Zhang, he was questioned at the Railway Bureau by Police Chief Wang Zhaohu, and recorded by Liang Zhan, the section chief of the Document Section. This was also a free statement. If your esteemed Court wishes to know the details of the questioning at that time, you can summon Wang and Liang to the court for questioning. However, in Zhang Honggang's mind, the court hearing record can be overturned, so the Railway Bureau's questioning record can be denied at will. This is not my intention to change his testimony, but rather his own desire to change it. If Zhang Hongtu tells the truth, his words should be consistent throughout. However, because he intends to be cunning and tells lies, no matter how hard he tries to be careful, there will be loopholes in the end, which is what is meant by trying to hide the truth only to reveal it.</p>
<p>(C) Zhang Honggang generally does not admit to his criminal behavior or blames it on his wife, Yu Xiangyan. In reality, Zhang and Yu are husband and wife, and they are together day and night. He started the wrongdoing by Zhang Honggang deliberately holding back the purchase orders. Then, Zhu Biwen suggested Zhang Kaiyuan, and Zhang Kaiyuan informed Zhang Bokang that he had to cooperate with the director's wife. Zhu Biwen is Yu Xiangyan's personal friend, and Zhang Hongtu employed him to be a tool for making money. How could Zhang Honggang not know this? This is one point. Materials Department staff such as Zhang Bokang went in and out of their house day and night, and were very familiar with Yu Xiangyan. Zhang Honggang could see and hear this. His occasional deliberate avoidance was to collude with Yu to cover up the wrongdoing. This is the second point. Zhang Hongtu claimed to know that Yu Xiangyan had money, and also claimed that he did not know where Yu Xiangyan's money came from. Why didn't Zhang ask? If he said it was from business, then he couldn't point out what kind of business and the details. This shows that what he was engaged in was the corruption of the Materials Department. This is the third point. It is not uncommon for one spouse to commit a crime and conceal it successfully, without the other spouse knowing. However, the corruption lasted for more than half a year, the property suddenly increased, the subordinates were in close contact, and the crime was related to his own responsible affairs. In addition, there are testimonies from accomplices that are unfavorable to him, such as the testimonies of Zhang Bokang and Zhu Biwen. Zhang Honggang's criminal evidence is solid and there is no doubt about it.</p>
<p>Regarding Yu Xiangyan's portion</p>
<p>(A) Yu Xiangyan disappeared after the case was discovered. I personally went with the Police Chief Wang Zhaohu to search at the Weiguang Hospital and other places pointed out by Zhang Hongtu at 4:00 AM on June 25th. The next day, Chief Wang Zhaohu went to Zhu Rongsheng's house, another location provided by Zhang Hongtu, at 2:00 AM, but there was no trace of her. Then, Zhang Hongtu was escorted to your esteemed Court, and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters was sent a document requesting assistance in apprehending Yu Xiangyan and bringing her to justice. Zhang Hongtu himself confessed that Chen Bozhuang detained me and wanted me to hand over Yu Xiangyan, which shows that I have done my best to pursue Yu Xiangyan. The details of the process can be found in our Bureau's letter to the Procuratorate on July 10th. Yu Xiangyan's claim that she met with me three times is entirely false. As for Yu Xiangyan's criminal behavior, there is the testimony of Zhang Bokang and others to prove it. She received 24 million [currency unit unspecified] in bribes. Other defendants have confirmed this. How can Yu deny it alone? Furthermore, Zhu Biwen is indeed Yu's confidant, and Zhu Biwen was the first to suggest that Zhang Bokang cooperate with her. Zhu also confessed that Yu Xiangyan used the excuse of buying a piano to promote the corruption. This is very clear. As for Yu Xiangyan's random accusations in an attempt to escape punishment, she first blamed me, because I advocated a thorough investigation of this case. Then, she blamed Zhang Yunhe, claiming that Yunhe was a stepping stone. Then, she insulted the prosecutors, because they represented the state in filing the public prosecution. Finally, she even insulted the dignity of the entire judiciary. The more she slanders, the more obvious her crime becomes. Because Yu's behavior is improper and she does everything, it is appropriate that she is bold and reckless. After committing the crime, she still does not repent. If this person and Zhang Honggang are not severely punished by the law, then the principles of justice will not exist, and how can we expect to cleanse the government?</p>
<p>Regarding Zhang Bokang's portion</p>
<p>Zhang Bokang's lawyer argued on his behalf: "If it is said that Zhang Bokang colluded with merchants to collect commissions, then this commission is also recognized by the Railway Bureau. Otherwise, how could the Railway Bureau go to the merchants after the case was discovered and forcibly collect money to make up the amount of the commission?" It is important to note that the defendants in this case colluded with merchants to collect commissions. In ordinary commercial transactions, there may be the wisdom of so-called commissions. However, as a public official, receiving a salary from the government, one should maintain integrity and not directly or indirectly seek profit in the affairs under one's management or supervision. If there is any attempt to seek profit, no matter what the commercial name is, it is considered embezzlement under the law. The reason why our Bureau thoroughly investigated this case and sent it to the court for investigation is precisely because it does not recognize that the commission system should exist in public institutions. Furthermore, the source of the commission is not the selling merchant who can take it out of his own pocket and feed the tiger. It is actually selling the goods at a higher price. As the common saying goes, "The wool comes from the sheep." Therefore, the profit gained by the offender is the loss to the public. And before the merchant, who has received the payment, has not deducted this illegal profit and handed it over to the offender, it is called stolen money for the merchant who has been convicted, and it is called unjust enrichment for the merchant who has not been convicted. Our Bureau must recover it according to law. Therefore, the railway police were sent to accompany the offenders to the merchants to collect the stolen money. If this is referred to as the Bureau recognizing the commission, and therefore the defendants can be relieved of their guilt, there is no room for such a distortion logically or legally. In summary, we respectfully submit this letter for your consideration. Respectfully, to the Criminal Division of the Shanghai District Court.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Sa Benju's Case of Marrying While His Wife Was Still Alive Sentenced to Four Months; Plaintiff Dissatisfied <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of Sa Benju, the nephew of the famous naval veteran Admiral Sa Zhenbing, being sued by his wife for bigamy, was concluded by the District Court after three trials. Yesterday, Judge Meng announced the verdict: Sa Benju was sentenced to four months of imprisonment for having continuous adultery while having a spouse, and Shi Biren was sentenced to four months of imprisonment for continuously having adultery with someone who had a spouse. If the sentence is commuted to a fine, it will be calculated at 500 [currency unit unspecified] per day. The civil suit was dismissed as incidental. The two defendants, Sa and Shi, were not present in court yesterday. Only their lawyers attended the hearing. After hearing the verdict, the plaintiff, Ms. Chen Jizheng, believed that if the sentence was commuted to a fine, four months would only require 60,000 [currency unit unspecified], and the two of them would only need 120,000 [currency unit unspecified]. She expressed dissatisfaction and will appeal.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Li Fang Sentenced to Three Years; Zhang Genshou and Sun Xiaolin Each Sentenced to Four Years <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Li Fang was sentenced to three years of imprisonment by the High Court yesterday, with three years of deprivation of civil rights. All of his property, except for the necessary living expenses for his family, was confiscated. It is important to note that Li Fang, also known as Li Lianfang, with the alias Qinglian Jushi, is 52 years old this year and is from Huangpi, Hubei. He has been serving in the diplomatic community. In the 26th year of the Republic [1937], he resigned from his position as the Consul-General in Novosibirsk. After returning to China, he was transferred to Guangzhou to handle diplomatic affairs with the British and Americans in Hong Kong until he came to Shanghai in the 27th year [1938]. Later, he was appointed by the puppet government as the "Minister" to Romania and the "Ambassador" to Germany, concurrently serving as the "Minister" to Hungary. During the sentencing yesterday, the presiding judge briefly explained the reasons for the verdict, stating: Li Fang participated in a meeting of the puppet government in Shanghai in the 29th year [1940], and after the 30th year [1941], he repeatedly received orders from the puppet government as a diplomatic envoy, and privately discussed "overall peace" with Kawaki, the director of the enemy army's Shanghai office. His actions of collaborating with the enemy cannot be denied. However, he did not take office for any of the puppet positions, and the private discussion of "peace" was initiated by Kawamoto, so the circumstances were not significant. Furthermore, he had assisted Hubei in transporting legal tender to Kunming during his time in Hong Kong, which was beneficial to the War of Resistance to some extent. Therefore, the sentence was reduced. Li did not express any feelings after hearing the verdict, but his wife and daughters cried incessantly. The court allowed him to meet with his family briefly before being taken back to prison. In addition, the High Court also sentenced Zhang Genshou and Sun Xiaolin, who were suspected of being traitors, to four years of imprisonment each.</p>

Both are scheduled for sentencing in the morning and afternoon of the 28th of this month.</p>
<p>Zhang Tao, the president of the puppet Supreme Court, and Zhang Sumin, who served as the director of the Customs Administration of the puppet Ministry of Finance and the director of the Enemy Property Management Office of the puppet Ministry of Finance, were interrogated by the High Court yesterday morning and ordered to be detained for further interrogation at a later date.</p>
<p>[Another News] The High Procuratorate has filed a case against Chen Boyun, Gao Feng, Xu Xiuting and others on suspicion of being traitors.</p>

In February of this year, she ran away with Wang without her mother's knowledge and lived with him in the kitchen shed at 97 South District Street in the South City. Because Wang's income was insufficient, her mother took her back in July. After Wang Gende found out Xu Bingyun's address and the location of her factory, he repeatedly met with her, wanting to run away together again. After she refused, Wang harbored resentment. Yesterday morning around 6 a.m., Wang, armed with a sharp knife, broke into the girl's residence. The girl was doing her hair. Wang took out his knife and stabbed her arms and legs six times.

<p>[Our Report] In order to develop China's fisheries and improve fishing technology, the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration will soon recruit fishery personnel and hire American fishery experts to train them. According to Li Xiangyuan, senior technician and director of the first group of the Agricultural Committee of the Administration and Relief, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) currently has 31 new fishing boats, moored at Fuxing Island, under the administration of the Administration and Relief. Each of these ships has seven American fishing boat crew members. Currently, they are using these ships for experimental purposes, such as testing whether equipment and fishing nets are suitable for fishing in Chinese rivers or oceans.</p>
<p>The training period is about one year</p>
<p>The Administration and Relief has not yet decided on the specific methods, qualifications, and quotas for recruiting students. However, it is planned that graduates of aquatic product schools are most suitable for applying. After being admitted, it is planned to use UNRRA fishing boats for training, tentatively training on the ship for two months, river or coastal training for three months, and then interning in rivers and seas for half a year. During the training period, the Administration and Relief will provide expenses. After graduation, they will be assigned to various fishery organizations and institutions to serve.</p>

<p>(1) Kidney Stone Disease</p>
<p>Wu Asks: In early April, I suddenly felt a severe pain in my right waist. I asked a doctor to inject painkillers and two injections of penicillin, and I gradually felt calm. After a few weeks, I felt pain in that area again. I suspected it was kidney disease, so I went to a hospital to test my urine. The results showed pus cells, red blood cells, and a small amount of protein. More than a month ago, a small stone was discharged in my urine. The big ones are kidney stones. I have taken Helmitol six or seven times and injected 1.2 million units of penicillin, but it has not worked. Recently, a doctor friend of mine ordered me to take sixty tablets of Sulfamerazine and said that the disease is pyelitis (caused by tonsillitis). I don’t know how effective Sulfamerazine is, what the reaction is, and how to interpret this disease. What are the active treatment methods? I would like to ask for an answer.</p>
<p>[Answer by Doctor of Medicine Tang Renjin] The disease may be pyelitis caused by kidney stones. The efficacy of Sulfamerazine is as an anti-inflammatory and sterilizing agent. The reaction can sometimes stimulate the gastric mucosa, causing loss of appetite and nausea. You should take more diuretics and fluids. For active treatment, you can ask a urologist to perform kidney pelvis lavage, which may be effective.</p>
<p>(2) Nosebleeds</p>
<p>Zhu Yuxiang asks: My second son had measles when he was four years old. The following year, he suddenly had nosebleeds. Since then, it has occurred eight or nine times or three or four times a year. He has been treated by Chinese and Western doctors, but it has been ineffective. He is now thirteen years old, thin, and his appetite has decreased. Now his nosebleeds have occurred again, with a lot of bleeding. He needs medical treatment urgently. I don’t know if there is a specific medicine to treat this disease. Please answer.</p>
<p>[Answer by Doctor of Medicine Tang Renjin] There is no specific medicine for nosebleeds. You should check for systemic diseases (such as checking the stool for parasites at his age) and treat them. For local bleeding, a nose specialist can perform chemical cauterization or electrical cauterization, which is often effective.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Mayor Wu Decides Cotton Yarn Will Be Re-Allocated Once More Allocation Amount is 10,529 Pieces Raw Material Price Allocation and Other Sub-Committees Established <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] At 3 p.m. yesterday, Mayor Wu convened representatives of the cotton spinning, dyeing and weaving, and replication industries to discuss concrete measures to suppress the price of yarn and cloth. Responsible persons from the six districts of the cotton spinning industry, dyeing and weaving industry, knitting industry, towel and blanket industry, yarn industry, and cotton cloth handkerchiefs attended. First, the mayor delivered a speech, stating that the last meeting decided that each association should report its production equipment, production quantity, required raw material quantity, and last month's production and sales situation to the meeting. However, each association has not fully complied so far. For items such as the quantity of goods sold, they have not been able to fill in truthfully, making auditing and allocation difficult. In the future, it is hoped that each association will cooperate fully with the government to handle matters truthfully so that a reasonable and fair price can be determined.</p>
<p>Wang Qiyu said that the price increase of yarn and cloth is due to insufficient supply. Sales in other ports are very strong, especially in Guangzhou, where the price of 20-count yarn has reached 3.8 to 3.9 million yuan. Ports such as Wuhu have also reached 2.8 million yuan. In addition, raw material prices are high. Manufacturers want to use American cotton, but foreign exchange requests are not easy to obtain. At the same time, the power supply is insufficient, and production cannot be maximized. As for the yarn allocation issue for yarn shops, because yarn shops are not sellers but agents for replication factories in other ports, yarn allocation should be allocated in the same way.</p>
<p>Shu Yunzhang said, (1) For future allocation, the previous ratio of 60% for private enterprises and 40% for building and spinning will be tried again once. (2) The government should provide a large amount of foreign exchange for the purchase of American cotton. If domestic cotton is insufficient, it will only be possible to purchase it from abroad.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu finally decided, (1) The supply and demand of yarn and cloth and various relationships make it difficult to be suitable at present, but it must be allocated in a reasonable way to curb the black market. (2) Foreign exchange cotton purchases are often requested from the Executive Yuan, which is transferred to the Central Bank for processing. (3) The power supply was previously agreed to be reduced for user power. The Municipal Council has now agreed, and it will be implemented soon. (4) Develop the Southeast Asian yarn and cloth market to earn foreign exchange. (5) As for what Manager Shu said about trying another allocation recently, according to the monthly yarn requirement reported by each association, which is 26,055 pieces, it was decided to allocate 10,529 pieces first to meet the urgent needs of each factory. (6) The allocation price is based on the cost of raw materials and labor, plus reasonable profits and preparation fees. (7) For yarn allocation, each trade association will change to allocating according to the actual needs of each factory. (8) Each association should report the finished products, quantity, cost, and sales customers of the allocated yarn in detail for auditing. Then, Deputy Director Li supplemented Mayor Wu's opinions on the decision-making method. Each trade association (1) should form a research group on the quantity of raw materials needed in order to statistically determine the exact amount of raw materials currently needed by manufacturers in the industry, (2) should form an evaluation group to evaluate the factory sales prices of finished products based on the cost of raw materials and labor and reasonable profits, and (3) should form an allocation group to supervise the actual sales of finished products by each manufacturer.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Building and Spinning Allocation as Usual, Prices Not Changed <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The China Building and Spinning Company opened for yarn distribution yesterday as usual, selling 380 and a half pieces. The allocation price remained the same. 20-count Shuiyue allocated to the underwear and towel associations and the Changzhou handicraft industry. 30-count Lanfeng allocated to knitting (from number 147 to number 307) and the handicraft association. 42-count Lanfeng allocated to the dyeing and weaving industry (from number 1 to number 161).</p>

<p>The yarn market continued to hold firm yesterday. In the early morning, the price of each brand was shouted as high as 5.7 million yuan. Sales were not quiet, so the situation was very stable. Before the close of the market, the supply was slightly abundant, so it fell by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. As a result, it rose by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan compared to last weekend.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Few Bond Transactions <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The bond market was mediocre, with few transactions. The process was stagnant. Tongbing opened at 2,200 yuan and zero, and was immediately supplied by many retail investors. It gradually fell to within 2,100 yuan to close. As a result, it fell by 40 yuan compared to last Saturday. Miscellaneous brands were still flat. A, B, D, and E each rose by 30 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Chinese Stock Market Sentiment Declines, Limited Transactions in the Market <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Chinese stocks closed even weaker. Selling pressure was still rampant. In the early morning, each stock rose slightly. After the opening, there were foreign stock accounts that came to buy, and it was slightly stable. However, there were sellers from the yarn and cloth group, and the rise was blocked. After 9:40, the decline became stronger. The market was unusually quiet, and buyers disappeared. It fell slightly step by step. At 11:10, Yongsha broke 720 yuan, showing the most tired state. Five minutes later, there were buyers from the Guangdong gang. It recovered slightly after hitting a low, but the transactions were limited, and it was unable to sustain. Soon it fell again. After 11:40, the banking gang bought a little, and number 176 and others also bought. The situation was slightly different. Before the close, the bulls and bears competed with each other, presenting a stalemate. The morning close was slightly fixed. Compared to last Saturday, popular stocks except for Xinguang, which was flat, all fell slightly. Only the company was stable among the cold stocks, and the rest fell. The afternoon opening was stable, and there were few transactions, causing anxiety among the bulls. In addition, number 143 came to sell Yongsha and Idichet. After 2:30, the decline suddenly started. Yongsha, Meiya, and others saw low prices again, but the bulls and bears took advantage of it. Near the close, the outlook was good. China Silk once fell to 5,130 yuan, the limit down, and finally quickly recovered. As a result, compared to last Saturday, the popular stocks Yongsha, Meiya, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each fell by about 3%. Xinli only fell slightly. Among the cold stocks, Tongyi Underwear, Xinya Match, and Huafeng Cement fell slightly. China Silk, China Textile, Datong, and Rongfeng each fell by about 50%. The company Jinglun and Lian were stable. The gains and losses of each stock outside the market were very small.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were initially stable and then tired. High prices were still difficult to sustain. The initial high was followed by a low, and then it hovered near the close. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Yeguang, Yi Sha, Paper Industry, Yipi, and Steel Industry fell. Huidet fell by 50%, and the UK Union Airlines rose slightly.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Gold Price Weakens Slightly, Foreign Currencies Stable <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai bare metal remained stable yesterday. The morning opening was 2,225,000. After the opening, the situation was stable. However, there was some closing of the week's floating, which once declined slightly. After 10 a.m., the Central Bank allocated 150 bars at a price of 2,217,500, and it was even more mediocre after that. However, because there were not many transactions, it once fell slightly to 2,208,000. At noon, it still stood at around 2,215,000. There were even fewer transactions in the afternoon, and the market price turned slightly weak. As a result, it fell by 15,000 compared to last Saturday. The listed price of jewelry in silver shops did not change. Sterling silver was flat and silver dollars fell slightly. The implicit interest rate for silver was inconsistent. The securities industry was looser, and miscellaneous industries were slightly tighter. The interest rate was still from 15% to 18%.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies were stable. There were still no transactions at the official price of the US dollar. The black market was around 4,150 yuan to 4,200 yuan. It was calm and unchanged in the afternoon. As a result, compared to last Saturday, it was slightly more stable. Although the Hong Kong market was prosperous, due to silver funds in this city, the supply was more abundant. Yesterday, the market struggled between 780 yuan and 790 yuan. As a result, it fell by 10 yuan compared to last Saturday. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 880 yuan to 900 yuan. The Indian exchange rate was 1,060 yuan to 1,080 yuan.

<p>[Our Report] The Philippine ship "Stanheholt" chartered by Warren Foreign Company, arrived in Shanghai on the 20th carrying 750,000 feet of lumber from the US and Australia. It was moored at buoys number seven and eight on the South Huangpu River. Because the Philippine ship arrived in Shanghai and the customs procedures were not completed, the customs did not accept the import. The company has sent a letter to the US consulate, which has been forwarded to the embassy, to request a temporary solution from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Therefore, the lumber can only be unloaded after the foreign affairs procedures are completed. The lumber is handled by China and Company.</p>

<p>The Chinese Cement Industry Federation, previously concerned about the massive influx of foreign cement that gravely threatened domestic manufacturers, submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance two months ago to increase cement import tariffs to curb dumping. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance has responded to Shanghai, stating that the current cement import tariff, set at 40% ad valorem, is already not low. The Federation is greatly alarmed and recently submitted another request to the Ministry of Finance, thoroughly and urgently pointing out the necessity of revising the cement import tariff from various factual and legal perspectives, and firmly urging the government to make a prompt decision and implement it immediately, otherwise this national industry, which has consistently achieved success, will inevitably go bankrupt. It is heard that the Federation also held an emergency board meeting the night before last to discuss further countermeasures.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Priority for Textile Machinery: British Representative Expresses Sympathy; Australian Wool Not Shipped to Japan <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Deputy Director Zhang of the China Textile Corporation has returned to Shanghai after completing his trip abroad. When asked by reporters about the negotiations with British textile industry representatives in Beijing, he replied: In terms of textile equipment, he had earnestly explained to the British representatives that China's goal was to restore the pre-war figure of five million spindles, which was only to make up for losses and not to expand; he hoped that Britain could deeply understand this point and give China priority when purchasing textile machinery. Currently, Britain must consider its own needs while exporting textile machinery to creditor nations, making it difficult for China to order machinery from Britain. This negotiation took the most time but ultimately gained the sympathy of the British representatives and achieved a satisfactory result. Regarding raw materials, since almost all Australian wool is shipped to Britain, China requested to be allocated a portion. Recent reports stated that Australia would export a large amount of wool to Japan to revive Japan's wool textile industry. When specifically inquired with the British representatives, it was learned that this was not true. As for the British textile industry, it is currently undergoing a process of modernization. However, because most factories were established too long ago, the facilities are older, and the welfare is worse, British workers are generally unwilling to work in textile factories, which is a major obstacle to the development of the British cotton textile industry.</p>
<p>[British Information Service, London, 21st] In order to restore Britain's leading position in the world's textile machinery, there is currently an important new development in Britain. All major cotton yarn mills in Britain have decided to establish a permanent research institute as soon as possible to review and compare the latest machinery production methods and cotton fabrics. A new machinery factory near Bolton, Lancashire, has used new methods to produce yarn, which is one and a half times faster than the old method. This industry is one of the oldest in British history, established in the 16th century and modernized in the 18th century. However, by the 20th century, its new textile machinery was more outdated than the equipment of new industries abroad, so the British government appointed a working group, which emphasized in its report in May this year that existing equipment should be replaced with modern machinery. Currently, textile machinery produced in Britain accounts for 75% of the total being shipped abroad.</p>

<p>The Taiwan-style fine red tea imitated by local tea factories is still popular with Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., and the selling price is also quite high. If the suppliers can reduce the price, trading firms like the Indian Yule Catto &amp; Co. will continue to purchase it. Among other teas, newly produced Wenzhou tea is still selling the most smoothly. Although exporters are also interested in high-quality old tea, it is scarce and difficult to choose for the time being, so the market remains quiet. It is also heard that French merchant house Ewo, after its foreign manager flew to Shanghai last week, is currently actively planning to resume business, making smooth progress, and plans to start trading soon. Export of old tea has been active in recent months. Because of the lower cost, it is also quite profitable, but due to inconsistent quality, problems occur from time to time, causing difficulties for exporters. It is recently heard that the United States and France have banned the import of this old tea, with only a small amount still being shipped to India.</p>

<p>In recent years, the processing and packaging of China's exported leather goods have greatly improved. In the past, leather hides were of uneven sizes, and the cleaning process often failed to remove all dirt. This drawback has now been reformed so that foreign importers only need to dye the leather after import to make exquisite and luxurious clothing. According to people in the industry, China can also complete the dyeing process. However, because the international market charges a 65% import tax on finished products, while undyed leather is treated as raw material and only taxed at 12.5%, China's leather goods are still exported undyed.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Control of Woolen Yarn: Raw Materials and Dyes Uncontrollable; Finished Products Also Impossible to Fully Control; Requesting Government to Negotiate for Undelivered Machinery <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The price of woolen yarn has risen sharply in the past month, and the municipal government is trying to suppress it, hence the price negotiation. According to the persons in charge of the two industry associations, there are three reasons for the price increase: (1) After the exchange rate adjustment, prices of everything have risen, and woolen yarn is no exception. (2) When prices are rising sharply, other industries are also hoarding woolen yarn to preserve the value of their money, which causes the price to rise. (3) During this period, some woolen yarn factories have stopped production due to boiler damage, and several factories have stopped production due to electricity problems, which has reduced the market supply. However, today, the rising trend has passed, and prices have started to fall due to the weak purchasing power of ordinary citizens. As for the government's desire to control the woolen yarn industry, there are obvious difficulties because the supply of raw materials and dyes is controlled by foreigners, and there is a black market due to the difficulty of purchasing them. This is one difficulty. At the same time, the association cannot purchase all the products of each factory, so the implementation of control cannot have an absolute effect. This is another difficulty. As for the source of raw materials, they come from countries such as Australia, Britain, and the United States, but these countries are all in the process of industrial recovery, and wool is under control, making it difficult to export. The general export method is for merchants in those countries to ship it to Belgium, and then transship it to China. However, today, this method is becoming increasingly impractical because Belgium also needs wool for its own use. The main sales market for woolen yarn in this city is the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and a small amount is also shipped to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The woolen yarn industry has two specific hopes for the government: (1) The wool textile machinery ordered in Britain was originally scheduled for delivery in three years, which is too long. It is hoped that with the government's intervention, the goods can be received sooner. (2) It is hoped that with the government's assistance, a large supply of high-quality wool from various countries can be obtained.</p>

<p>As the cold winter approaches, woolen scarves are a necessary item for keeping warm.

The colors and quality are excellent.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Rayon: Allocation Incomplete with Colors and Sizes; Market Still Difficult to Stabilize <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, the No. 120 bright rayon on the overpass still traded at the original price of 3.45 million yuan from last weekend, with few transactions. The No. 120 semi-bright was only traded at 2.9 million yuan in the morning, and in the afternoon, someone collected it, and the price was raised by another 150,000 yuan. The No. 75 semi-bright was also more than 100,000 yuan higher than last week. The No. 150 bright is scarce on the market, with demand exceeding supply. Yesterday, the price suddenly rose by more than 300,000 yuan. According to people in the silk weaving industry, it is hoped that when the Central Trust Bureau purchases rayon from Japan, all sizes must be complete, and bright, semi-bright, and matte must be matched, so that it can meet the actual needs of each factory. Otherwise, this rise and fall will never be completely suppressed. The factory warp market is mediocre. Yesterday, the 78-point D-grade was traded by Indian merchants in more than ten packages, priced at 2.65 million yuan, with no change from the asking price last weekend. Silk fabrics are still depressed, and the market is sluggish. Huajin crepe is asking for 3.1 million yuan, but there are very few transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Central Trust Bureau Continues Allocation <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Furthermore, yesterday the Central Trust Bureau allocated less than 200 boxes of rayon, with a total of 128 applicants. The allocation price was the same as the previous time. Today's black market still reached 3.3 million yuan, and at one point in the afternoon, it was as high as 3.5 million yuan. People in the silk weaving industry believe that the listed price is slightly too high, which led to this. The delivery orders for the previous allocation have been received by the association, and members can go and collect them. For those applying for allocation from other areas, in addition to Hangzhou, which has been determined to receive 200 boxes, Suzhou has been determined to receive 20 boxes this month and will increase to 80 boxes next month. It is said that Shengze has not been determined because no one has come to take over the matter.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the registration of customers and goods in the rice market in the north and south totaled more than 9,000 shi. The market was sluggish. Medium and low-grade japonica rice fell by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, indica rice was weak by 300 to 500 yuan to 1,000 yuan, and white yuan and yin yuan fell sharply by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Shantou's rice from Zhejiang moved slightly. Vegetable oil was weak in the morning and tight in the afternoon, showing a slight strength. Sesame oil was flat. Both Shantou qingwu wheat were inquired about and continued to rise by 1,000 yuan. Guangbang yellow hemp moved slightly, rising by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Raw peanuts had an excess of supply and demand, falling sharply by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Northeast soybeans arrived in large quantities, falling sharply by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Broad beans followed suit, falling by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Red sorghum followed down by 2,000 yuan. Green beans fell by another 1,000 yuan. Bean cake fell by 400 to 500 yuan. Red beans were weak, falling by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Exports of White Tung Oil Quiet; Domestic Sales of Hongjiang Tung Oil Also Slow <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>A week ago, the price of white tung oil in Yingcheng suddenly surged, reportedly due to Guangdong merchants mobilizing to export it through Hong Kong, settling foreign exchange at black market rates. Unexpectedly, this was only a one-time transaction and could not be continued. Currently, because the new oil is about to be produced and the remaining old oil is very little, the production price has been telegraphed to increase repeatedly. However, after being shipped to Shanghai, it still requires an additional 120,000 yuan per dan, while selling it for export only fetches slightly over 110,000 yuan, making the traders helpless. There is almost no one in this city talking about exporting, but vegetable oil factories may have some transactions or still be profitable, which is not known to outsiders. Domestic sales have reached 125,000 yuan per dan, but sales are extremely small and only for decoration.</p>
<p>Hongjiang tung oil is not in season for domestic sales, but as the price of white tung oil rises, the cost naturally increases, and it has to be slightly increased as well.

<p>Duck feather production has reached its peak season.

<h3 id="e153">Difficulty in Developing Sales of Sichuan Medicinal Herbs; Export Volume Only One-Tenth of Pre-War Level <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Sichuan medicinal herbs have a long-standing reputation. The sales market is wide, extending not only throughout the country but also to Europe, America, Southeast Asia, and Annam, making it a major export of Sichuan Province. The most famous include rhubarb, turmeric, angelica, chuanxiong, fritillary bulbs, cordyceps, codonopsis, etc. Before the war, the export volume was estimated at 6,000 tons of rhubarb, 1,500 tons of angelica, and less chuanxiong, but still over 500 tons. During the war, exports almost came to a complete standstill. In the year since the victory, the export volume has been less than one-tenth of pre-war levels. Currently, the export of local medicinal herbs is limited to a few places such as Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou, and the quantity is limited. The reasons are: first, traffic is blocked and transportation is difficult, increasing costs; second, each trade guild in the industry has an old-fashioned organization with limited capital; third, the overseas market has not recovered commercially after the war, and purchasing power is also weak. Remittances from overseas Chinese are also restricted by local governments, making it difficult to remit funds back for free purchases in large quantities. For example, a batch of rhubarb shipped from Chongqing to Australia and then transshipped overseas a few months ago, totaling 150,000 jin and valued at 300 million yuan, is still frozen in Guangzhou due to difficulties in foreign exchange settlement. Fourth, production has decreased. Recently, the British and American consulates have sent a large number of orders, intending to purchase at high prices, but they require immediate delivery of the goods with immediate payment in Shanghai, and the quantity must be at least 50 tons. The industry lacks a large amount of inventory and does not dare to accept the orders.</p>

Yesterday's Flight Delayed, Rescheduled for This Morning's Southern Departure. Temporarily Retained for a Victory in a Small Match. <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Chunsheng Basketball Team was originally scheduled to fly south yesterday morning. The entire team left the hotel at 3:00 AM and went directly to the airport. Unexpectedly, after waiting until 5:00 AM, the flight was canceled. Left with no choice, they returned to the hotel. The vice president of the Sports Association, Wu Shaoshu, was overjoyed upon learning this, believing it to be a stroke of luck. He urgently requested the team to hold another exhibition game last night against the Luoyang Zhenglun team. Having obtained their consent, the game took place at the City Gymnasium starting at 9:00 PM last night. Over a thousand spectators, who learned of the event at the last minute, rushed to watch, creating a lively atmosphere. Ultimately, with extremely skillful performances from both sides, the Chunsheng team emerged victorious by a very close score of 63 to 53. In the first half, Chunsheng led by a narrow margin of 32 to 30, only ahead by two points. According to airline sources, there will definitely be a plane this morning to carry the athletes back south.</p>

<p>The exquisite, clear, and beautiful performances by both teams last night were unprecedented in recent times. Their agility and accurate shooting drew endless praise from the thousands of spectators, who were greatly pleased. This was a stark contrast to the lackluster performance of the previous night.

In the third quarter, they even led by as much as six points at 44 to 38, but unfortunately, they couldn't maintain it. Both teams had similar styles, making the match highly engaging. Zhenglun's rapid progress indicates a promising future.</p>
<p>Zhenglun Takes an Early Lead</p>
<p>With both teams lined up, Zhenglun dribbled the ball forward. In a flash, Ji Zhongqiang made a layup under the basket, opening the scoring. Chunsheng's Cai Wenzhang and Chen Jin followed up with successful shots, taking the lead at 4 to 2. Zhenglun's Tu Wenlong scored with a long shot, taking the lead again at 7 to 5. Chunsheng's Jin Zhi retaliated, tying the score again. Zhang Yuyi replaced Yang Wenhui, but Tu Wenlong scored again from the sideline, marking Zhenglun's third lead. The score fluctuated, creating intense excitement: 13 to 12, 15 to 14. In the end, Zhenglun led by one point in the first quarter.</p>
<p>In the second quarter, Chunsheng gradually started to gain momentum: 19 to 17. Yang Wenhui scored again, tying the score at 19, then 21, and 23, resulting in several ties. Zhenglun then took the lead again at 26 to 23 and 28 to 26. However, Chunsheng scored three consecutive baskets, ending the first half with a score of 32 to 30, giving Chunsheng the lead.</p>
<p>Chunsheng's Superior Strategy</p>
<p>The second half unfolded in an extremely tense atmosphere. Zhenglun did not show any weakness and gradually advanced amidst cheers, eventually taking the lead at 44 to 38. Chunsheng launched a spirited counterattack, surpassing Zhenglun in the third quarter at 47 to 46. At that moment, the tense atmosphere in the entire stadium was filled with shouts and cheers. In the final quarter, Jin De showed off his skills, and Chunsheng's superior strategy gradually gained the upper hand. Zhenglun's Wang Binghuan was ejected after committing his fifth foul. The final score was 63 to 53, with Chunsheng emerging victorious, much to everyone's delight. Although Zhenglun lost, they still earned honor.</p>

<h3 id="e183">Promoting Domestic Goods and Boosting Production <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Qingxiang</p>
<p>From the eight years of arduous War of Resistance, every Chinese person has learned one lesson, that is, if our China wants to stand in the world in the future and no longer be subjected to foreign aggression, it must actively complete the work of national modernization. To complete the construction of a modernized country, we need democratic unity in politics and promotion of production in economics. Without either, a new modernized China cannot be built.</p>
<p>Currently, all the people of China are calling for political unity and democracy, but the economic construction aspect has been somewhat overlooked. Everyone only knows that rising prices, shrinking production, and the dumping of foreign goods are putting the national economy and the people's livelihood into an extremely painful and extremely dangerous situation, but they do not know that the main reason for rising prices, shrinking production, and the dumping of foreign goods is that our production is too backward! Because of backward production, our production costs are high, so how can prices not rise? After prices rise, the people's purchasing power is weakened, so how can production not shrink? With shrinking production, the supply of many goods falls short of demand, so how can foreign goods not take the opportunity to dump on our markets? Therefore, the fundamental cause of the hardship of the Chinese people today is backward production. Backward production has led to the dumping of foreign goods, and the dumping of foreign goods has naturally led to the national economy and the people's livelihood bordering on bankruptcy. Therefore, to save the current economic crisis of the country and the people, political unity and democracy are extremely important, but promoting production and completing the construction of modernized production are equally important.</p>
<p>The task of the China Production Promotion Association is to assist producers in improving production and to solve the current difficulties for producers in distress, so that the young Chinese industry has the opportunity to develop and the economic construction of the entire country can gradually embark on the road to modernization. Because we know that only in this way can we fundamentally save China's economic crisis and fundamentally eliminate the poverty and suffering of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Therefore, promoting production is a century-long plan to rescue the national economy and the people's livelihood, which are on the verge of collapse, and it is also the most fundamental method. However, the promotion and completion of this fundamental method is by no means something that can be achieved overnight. However, looking around at the current situation of China's dilapidated production, everyone knows that in addition to treating the root cause, it is necessary to treat the symptoms at the same time in order to save this emergency situation that is placed before each of us. The way to treat the symptoms is to promote domestic goods. If, under the current circumstances, our poor Chinese compatriots still do not understand the severity of industrial bankruptcy and production stagnation, and are unwilling to endure temporary pain to promote domestic goods, then when the production of our own Chinese affairs tends to complete collapse, the pain at that time may be more than just rising prices.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people have long doubted the practical effect of this movement to promote domestic goods, because in the past 20 years or so, China has had movements to promote domestic goods almost every year, but until now, domestic goods have not been successfully promoted. The reason for this is, on the one hand, that the eight-year War of Resistance destroyed the cause of domestic goods production, and now it has to start all over again. On the other hand, after promoting domestic goods, it must be followed by promoting production. If we only know how to promote domestic goods and do not know how to promote production, the cause of domestic goods production will remain stagnant and unable to move forward, seeking progress from improving products, reducing costs, and so on, then the result of promoting domestic goods will inevitably remain equal to zero. The shortcomings of past movements to promote domestic goods cannot be said to be here, so our promotion of domestic goods today, holding exhibitions of domestic goods, is not simply to find sales channels for domestic goods manufacturers, but to use the promotion of domestic goods as a means to promote production and build modern industry. This is a basic strategy to save the national economy and the people's livelihood, and it is also an important step in building a modern country.</p>
<h3 id="e184">National Goods Exhibition and the Promotion of National Products Movement <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yinpu</p>
<p>We raised the slogan of "Promoting National Products" at least forty years ago. In the past, more than forty years ago, we started the national product promotion movement, and today, more than forty years later, we are still continuing this movement, and it seems that there has not been much progress in practice. The crisis of national products is only getting more and more serious. As a citizen, it is natural to promote national products. However, what we called promotion in the past focused on the consumer public, containing the meaning of auxiliary protection by everyone. Even though national products are not better in quality or cheaper in price than foreign products, as citizens, we should uphold the meaning of promoting national products, embrace the spirit of sacrifice, not use foreign products, and still use national products.</p>
<p>This movement to promote national products by requiring everyone's sacrifice has two major shortcomings: first, it is not easy to be universal; second, it cannot be sustained. Because buying good goods and buying cheap goods is a very natural desire of the general public. National products are not necessarily the best or the cheapest, and we need to sacrifice to buy them and use them. No matter what, we will not truly get the cooperation of the entire public. Therefore, it is said that this movement will not be universal. Even if we take a step back and say that the public can truly embrace the spirit of sacrifice to promote national products, the assistance that the production sector can expect from the public is at most temporary. In the early immature stage of industry, people need help, and people can understand and sympathize; however, after a considerable period of help, if it still cannot gradually grow as expected, people's love and protection will not be easily maintained. Therefore, it is said that this movement cannot be sustained.</p>
<p>The mistake of the past national product promotion movement was that it focused solely on the consumer public, while neglecting the production sector itself. It seems that every member of the public should embrace the spirit of promoting national products to purchase and use national products, while the production sector does not need to embrace the spirit of promoting national products to produce national products. The public is always the main body driving this movement, an active actor; the national product sector is always an object being pushed, a passive actor.</p>
<p>The establishment of this local national product exhibition market must be said to be an important step for the production sector to strive for the initiative. Waiting for customers to come to the door themselves is passive from the perspective of the store; now, with careful planning and centralized exhibitions, it has the effect of making customers have to come, and customers become passive, and the market has gained the initiative. Therefore, it is said that this move by the production sector is an important step in striving for the initiative. However, only with national products can there be exhibitions. This method, which has gained the initiative in the promotion of national products, still has to be implemented on the other hand – which is also a more fundamental aspect. This other aspect is the production of national products.</p>
<p>Therefore, taking advantage of this national product exhibition opportunity, which contains an active role, we should promote a national product promotion movement in the production sector. We must know that only when the production sector can embrace the spirit of promoting national products to produce national products can it gradually strive for a dominant position.</p>
<p>In the past, under the sentiment of the public promoting national products, a part of the production sector unconsciously developed a kind of dependence mentality, as if they always felt that success or failure was in the hands of others; unconsciously formed a kind of inferiority complex, as if they always felt that their foundation was too weak and could never compete with foreign products. In the past, the crude and simple equipment and the short-sighted policy of our country's production sector cannot be said to have been influenced by this mentality to some extent.</p>
<p>This psychological illusion should be corrected immediately. Producing national products is not only for the sake of personal short-term interests, but also bears the mission of promoting national products. That is to say, to gradually establish the position of national products so that foreign products have no way to intervene is the true promotion of national products. If we only work hard on the public side, even if we are completely successful, we will only do half of it at most. The other half, which is also the more important half, should be borne by the production sector itself. The production sector should fully cultivate the spirit of independent struggle, knowing that relying on the promotion of the public is unreliable; they should have full confidence and belief, knowing that as long as they can work hard, as long as their direction of efforts is correct, the position of national products can definitely be established, and competing with foreign products is not a problem.</p>
<p>The final goal of the production sector's efforts is naturally to have "cheap and good" products. Even if they cannot be cheaper than others or better than others, they must be as cheap as others and as good as others. As a last resort, they must at least be not much more expensive than others and not much worse than others. In this way, coupled with the exhibition-style promotion with active meaning, coupled with the public's promotion sentiment, the position of national products can naturally be consolidated.</p>
<p>If the production sector wants to achieve the goal of "cheap and good" products, there is naturally a direction to take. At present, production is subject to various environmental constraints. To immediately develop in a normal way, there will naturally be thousands of threads and many difficulties. However, from our point of view, whether it is the problem of mechanical equipment, the problem of raw materials, the problem of technology, the problem of power, the problem of workers, etc., although each is a difficult problem at present, there are still ways to solve them. I am afraid that the most difficult to solve, and the most needed to be solved, is the basic problem of management and personnel. If we want to produce excellent products and reduce costs, I am afraid that we must thoroughly reform management and personnel. Lack of organizational ability has always been the biggest shortcoming in all aspects and departments of our country, and the production sector is no exception. Only after management is scientific and personnel can be rationalized can our production sector have a bright future, and our national products can have a real way out.</p>
<p>Therefore, on this day when the national product exhibition has been realized in this city, we hope that the production sector can go a step further, broaden their horizons, and express their spirit of promoting national products in terms of production efficiency. (October 18, 1946)</p>

<p>Wang Xiaolai said:</p>
<p>When buying things, everyone is used to saying buying "things," "Dong" means Eastern goods, and Xi means Western goods. In this way, we forget about our own national products. Now Western goods are coming in a steady stream, and Eastern goods are also trying to change their appearance and promote them in my city's market. Please pay attention!</p>

<h3 id="e186">Secrets of Marriage <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Juan</p>
<p>Marriage is Beneficial</p>
<p>Marriage is an extremely important matter for life, and it is extremely suitable for natural conditions. This can be fully proven by simply looking at the difference in health between married and unmarried people.</p>
<p>According to statistics, married people, especially men, have a much lower mortality rate than unmarried people of the same age. This proves that marriage is beneficial to health. But what is the reason? It differs for men and women.</p>
<p>In the case of women, after marriage, her experiences are not as abrupt as those of unmarried women. She can be freed from the fierce competition for survival, and both her mind and body are more stable and easygoing. In other aspects, after a woman develops to maturity, she needs to fulfill her natural duty of reproduction. If she does not engage in reproduction, it will be detrimental to her health.</p>
<p>In the case of men, the family can restore his fatigue, and a good wife can give him rest and comfort. This kind of effect is greater than that of a panacea. People without spouses cannot get this kind of comfort. A dry and tasteless family makes his tired body and mind even more tired. Unmarried men often stay up late at night, borrowing wine to relieve their sorrows, so they have many opportunities to suffer from neurasthenia or venereal diseases, which are harmful to their health and not insignificant.</p>
<p>Age of Husband and Wife</p>
<p>For marriage, the mental and physical health of both men and women is the first condition, so the age difference should not be too large. At present, some people practice early marriage, which is not very appropriate. Some old men marry young women; some middle-aged women fall in love with young men. This situation is even worse. Because old people who marry young wives and concubines have to find ways to win her favor, so they pretend to be energetic, and the result will inevitably be excessive labor, leading to premature aging, affecting health, and nothing can be added. In the case of young wives and concubines, although she will not be harmed, the result will inevitably be various problems due to sexual dissatisfaction. The result is the same between older unmarried women and younger men. Therefore, if the age of the husband and wife is too far apart, the family is prone to cracks, not only cracks in sexual life, but also cracks in health and cracks in life.</p>
<p>Men and women can only marry after their mind and body are mature. The age of maturity is probably 25 to 30 years old for men and 20 to 25 years old for women. It is naturally very appropriate to marry during this period, but under the current social conditions, due to the limitations of economic conditions, men mostly marry around the age of 30, but if women reach the age of 30, the body's tissues begin to harden, and childbirth is also more difficult, so they cannot marry too late, preferably around the age of 23 or 24. As for the age difference between husband and wife, it is generally 3 to 10 years, and it is not good to exceed it too much.</p>
<p>Attention to the First Night</p>
<p>Sexual behavior should be very cautious on the night of the wedding. In old-fashioned weddings, the "entering the bed" matter was considered very important. The matchmaker's responsibility could only be lifted after that night. Married people generally anticipate the situation of the first night. On the bride's side, although she tries her best to avoid getting married during her menstrual period, there are also various exceptions, such as the sudden onset of menstruation or other unfavorable events. Therefore, if you are anxious for sexual behavior for the first time, it may cause fear in the bride, or be frightened by bleeding. Under such circumstances, the shadows of unhappiness, revulsion, and fear will remain and become the cause of anesthesia.</p>
<p>As for the honeymoon trip after marriage, it is also worth considering. Because newlyweds are prone to excessive physical and mental fatigue, and their spirits must be unstable, if you add the hard work of traveling and the troubles of lodging, the nerves cannot be quiet, which is not suitable for health.</p>
<h3 id="e187">The Current Tasks of Chinese Women <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Renfeng</p>
<p>The world has changed from the matrilineal era to the patriarchal era, and it has been more than thousands of years since then. During this long period, women were locked in the dark prison—the family—living a very painful life of cattle and horses. It was not until after capitalism was produced in response to social needs that a small number of women were slowly liberated from imprisonment. But this is by no means the prosperity of women, it has its economic reasons. However, upon careful examination and review, are women now truly liberated? Has the entire women's world passed the prison-style family? Facts tell us that the result of the development of capitalism has made them have to regard family work as a must, and run to the factory to work, but they still cannot escape family chores and troubles, and suffer from the oppression and exploitation of the factory owners and capitalists. The painful situation is really beyond description. Of course, there are still some educated women who have been liberated from that kind of bondage, but they are often the vases of institutions and the playthings of landlords and capitalists. If we say that they have truly gained the status of being human, in the women's world, there are really only a minority of the minority.</p>
<p>Since women are subjected to heavy oppression, there are phenomena of their painful groans everywhere in society. Especially in China under the feudal ethics, they are restrained within the scope of the three obediences and four virtues, living a slave-like life. At the same time, because knowledge is self-enclosed, they cannot be given a sense and understanding of their interests, and they only know how to blame the heavens and obey fate. For example, the tragic news that often appears in newspapers about women committing suicide by taking poison, and young girls committing suicide...etc., nineteen out of ten are inseparable from the persecution of the environment. What is advocating freedom and equality is basically an extremely difficult movement to realize. Although there are many organizations of unmarried women's associations in today's cities, they are half empty names and do not engage in practical signboards.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the organization of women's associations is their group, requiring social status and power. But in fact, it is manipulated by the so-called modern noble ladies and rich young ladies or a part of the intellectual class in the city. Of course, these enthusiastic (?) women have shouldered great liberation goals and responsibilities, but the result is difficult to have real value. Because women's liberation is fundamentally not based solely on the formal shouts and actions of a small number of upper-class women. In other words, all women must receive considerable education.</p>
<p>Since Chinese women are not yet liberated, they should not only demand equal status, but should also take on the responsibility for the prosperity and decline of the entire country's wealth in advance, that is, they must change their own extravagant ideas. Now the alarming import of cosmetics in China, the outflow of money is worrying, it is the responsibility of women, which cannot be concealed by nice-sounding slogans. For example, vocational sports, rather than hoping that the backbone of urban women's associations and the intellectual class will implement it, it is better to downgrade and promote it to the countryside. In good conscience, we can also observe their simple life and reduce some of our own foreign atmosphere in the city. You should know that constantly applying makeup is definitely not liberation, wearing a Parisian hat, wearing high heels, wearing high heels is not an equal performance.</p>

<p>— Yu Feng</p>
<p>The following points are not baseless rumors, but facts that have been verified by the American Medical Association:</p>
<p>(1) The ratio of male infants to female infants produced during wartime is often higher than usual. Correct. The proportion of male infants to female infants born in each war is above 115 to 100.</p>
<p>(2) Healthy mothers often give birth to boys. Incorrect. The personality of the parents does not have a significant impact on the gender of the baby.</p>
<p>(3) Whether or not an unmarried woman is pregnant can be detected in the first ten days. Correct. Using the Aschhein-Zondek test, it is possible to definitively detect a woman's pregnancy or not. Because the excretions of pregnant women contain a large amount of salivary gland hormone. Injecting these hormones into mice makes their egg cells mature particularly quickly. By surgically dissecting and testing the ovaries of mice, the woman's conception or not can be detected.</p>
<p>(4) It is very dangerous for unmarried women who are too young or too old to give birth. Correct. Women who are under 20 or over 35 years of age have a higher mortality rate for their babies and mothers. It is safer between the ages of 20 and 35.</p>
<p>(5) Newborn male infants are often more delicate than female infants, and their mortality rate is also higher. □ Correct. In the first year, the number of deaths of male infants exceeds that of female infants by one-fifth.</p>
<p>(6) The size of the baby depends on the amount of food eaten by the mother during pregnancy. Incorrect. Recent medical opinion is that the mother's food intake does not directly affect the size of the baby at birth.</p>
<p>(7) It is more difficult to give birth to a male infant than to a female infant. Correct. Male infants are often larger than female infants, so they are more difficult to give birth, but not because of gender.</p>
<p>(8) Pregnant women should eat food for two people. Incorrect. Eating too much will increase weight, and being overweight can easily cause blood poisoning.</p>
<p>(9) Most cases of infertility after marriage can be cured. Correct. In recent years, the medical community has made great progress in the treatment of infertility.</p>
<p>(10) Fewer men suffer from infertility than women. Correct. Men with infertility account for 30% to 50% of the total.</p>
<p>(11) Although abortion is illegal, it is safer than childbirth. Incorrect. The mortality rate of abortion is more than ten times higher than that of normal childbirth.</p>
<p>(12) Older women are more likely to have twins than younger women. Correct. The greatest chance of having twins is for women over the age of 35. White-skinned women have more chances of having twins than brown-skinned women.</p>
<p>(13) The gender of the baby is determined at the time of conception. Correct. There are two types of male sperm, one that produces boys and one that produces girls. The determination of the baby's gender depends entirely on which sperm combines with the egg.</p>
<p>(14) Babies born to strong couples are often smarter than those born to young couples. Incorrect. The influence of parents on babies is after birth, not "prenatal education."</p>
<p>(15) It is easier to raise a baby born every year than a baby born every few years. Incorrect. When the two production periods are less than two years apart, the mortality rate is one and a half times that of having a child every few years.</p>

<h3 id="e190">About Toys <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Xuliang</p>
<p>One of Random Memories of a Trip to Sichuan</p>
<p>More than a month before the Lunar New Year, toys for children are already visible everywhere in Chengdu. Some are sold on the streets by vendors carrying them on poles, while others are displayed in front of shops. These shops, which normally sell other things, have all transformed into toy shops. The prices are very cheap. Pinwheels, drums, and clackers sell for only two hundred cash, which is less than one fen in legal tender. Ghost masks sell for six hundred or eight hundred cash. I haven’t bought small knives, small guns, trumpets, or toy drums, but I imagine they wouldn't be expensive either. Someone with a bit of silliness could spend half a dollar and fill a cloth bag, go to the homes of relatives and friends with children, and play Santa Claus, bringing much joy. Parents walking down the street with their children can easily take out money and buy one or two items to satisfy them. For adults, it’s barely spending any money, but I dare say that the joy children get from these toys is no different from getting a small car or a foreign doll.</p>
<p>I have traveled to many cities, but I have never seen one like Chengdu, where toys are abundant, cheap, and available so early. In this respect, the children of Chengdu are fortunate. Elsewhere, many things that children can play with are only widely available at the end of the year, and the prices are never so cheap. In larger cities, imported toys, whether from Japan or the West, have shockingly high prices. How many times have parents stood in front of the glass counters of department stores, pondering while their children clamor for them, calculating how to squeeze out the expense from the budget for firewood, rice, oil, salt, socializing, and their own entertainment! I myself have lingered in front of these glass counters—even though I wasn’t a father or married at the time—comparing this price and that price, while also trying to decide whether a ball, a train, or a small machine gun would be the most impressive and bring the most joy to a child. What is both infuriating and amusing is that in those cities with department stores, only these Japanese or Western goods are considered toys, or at least, gifts for children. If you give a child of a relative or friend a paper ball or a small drum, it’s like giving them a peanut. The child's parents will not only not be grateful but may even think you are looking down on their child and them. As a result, the children themselves suffer; they get fewer toys than they should and could. Socializing with children is unnecessary in the first place; if it's hard to please, it's better not to socialize at all.</p>
<p>This mistake, I think, is that parents are too quick to judge their children with their own minds and adult minds. We always buy things we like for our children, thinking that they will like them too. The Japanese or Western goods that we buy for children are often things that we want to play with ourselves. We see a small car running on the table, turning when it reaches the edge, and we are happy to watch it, so we buy it for our children. We see that the clothes of a foreign doll are well-made, like a chorus girl in a movie, and we think it’s beautiful, so we buy it for our children. Owners of Japanese or Western toy companies who understand the psychology of buyers, therefore, rack their brains to create toys that can make adults happy in order to trick them into buying them. Scientific talents with inventive minds and artistic talents with imagination are hired to participate in this trivial creation, making strange and wonderful things in the hope of arousing our scientific amazement and artistic joy. But for children, this is all a waste. Children who get these toys will be like Zhu Bajie eating a ginseng fruit, never chewing it carefully. Even if you say that it contains golden seeds of science and art, they will still see it as a stubborn piece of iron. In less than two days, the small car will be disassembled, and the foreign doll will be thrown into a corner of the room with the ghost mask, collecting dust.</p>
<p>We must never forget that toys are just toys, they cannot be science or art. A child with a sense of curiosity will automatically spend all day in his small car, just like he's exploring the natural phenomena around him, seeking science. A child with an aesthetic sense will also naturally quietly face his doll, the setting sun, and the moonlit night, appreciating beauty. These are unusual cases, and we do not deny that they exist; but the activities of ordinary children are not purely intellectual or purely appreciative. They play with toys because they cannot play with science and art like adults; they play because they want to play. Those toys just help them play. In this regard, a square wooden block is not necessarily less helpful, and a car that doesn't fall off the table is not necessarily more helpful. Children have their own world—a world of play; all they ask of toys is to give this ethereal world a touch of tangible reality, a fulcrum. So just having toys is enough; we don't need to worry about what kind of toys.</p>
<p>Children are inherently full of life. They just can’t be starved. Tonics like shark fin, sea cucumber, and bird’s nest are not needed. Those children who live in big cities are like Tantalus in Greek mythology, watching delicious grapes but unable to eat them. The children of Chengdu do not have so many temptations, but they can get their own simple meals of greens and rice. Easy to break, easy to make, easy to buy—these locally made toys sold on the streets of Chengdu are the only ones that truly belong to the children. For thousands of years, they have pleased our ancestors with their bright red, deep green, bright blue, simple and clear sounds, and simple designs. Now and in the future, they will please our children and grandchildren in the same way, like the spring grass that grows everywhere in Chengdu and in children's homes every year, even before spring arrives.</p>

<h3 id="e192">A Discussion on Sorrow and Joy <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Shusun Ruying</p>
<p>Sorrow and joy are common human emotions, impossible to force or suppress. Excessive development of sorrow leads to pessimism, while extreme expression of joy leads to optimism. While pessimism is undesirable, unconditional and unreserved optimism is not ideal either. Everyone tends slightly towards optimism or pessimism, but as long as this tendency isn’t too extreme, it should be left to its natural course, without deliberate guidance or suppression.</p>
<p>If one unfortunately experiences the loss of a close relative or friend, wailing and crying for three days is not excessive. If one encounters an old friend in a distant land, shaking hands and rejoicing, laughing loudly for thirty minutes is not inappropriate. Transcending emotions is beyond most people, but moderating emotional confusion, with self-control, is a necessary cultivation for modern people. Being sorrowful without losing ambition, and joyful without losing composure, makes sorrow and joy harmless and beneficial to both body and mind.</p>
<p>Whether sorrow or joy, as long as it’s a normal emotional release, it's not only harmless but also beneficial and necessary. In terms of psychological health, emotional excitement is closely related to the organs within the body. Internal organs, glands, and muscles all respond to emotions. This is a necessary adaptation to stimuli and the only way to appease them. Sorrow and joy arising without cause are pathological; but if sorrow and joy don’t arise when faced with sorrowful or joyful events, that too is pathological. Emotions are like flowing water; smoothing them leads to unobstructed flow, while blocking them leads to devastating floods. Therefore, for mental balance and health, proper release of sorrowful and joyful emotions is indispensable.</p>
<p>One wants to express sorrow and joy fully, but the constraints of reality often prevent it. This is the suffering of people throughout history, and a mental health trap. To relieve this suffering, to transcend this trap, humans seek to create an illusion, in which they can fully express their sorrow and joy. This illusion is artistic creation and appreciation.</p>
<p>Ancient Greece is the source of human art, and the ancient Greeks were the most able to fully express their sorrow and joy. Due to the differences in human character, they created many gods with different characters, and through these gods, expressed their sorrow and joy. Dionysus, the god of wine, is a passionate god who deeply understands human misfortune and suffering. Thus, to worship him, the Greeks created tragedy; and to balance the sad emotions, the Greeks imitated Dionysus' revelry and created comedy. Humans have tragedy and comedy, which evolved into various tragic and comedic arts, thus giving human sorrow and joy more opportunities and places to be fully expressed.</p>
<p>Art is an illusion; therefore, the stimulation it gives to human sorrow and joy is different from real life. Thus, it makes people feel pure emotions that are "sad but not resentful, happy but not excessive," which is of great benefit to human mental health. Furthermore, the inspiration of art gives us a sense of quiet joy. No matter what the sorrow or joy is, as long as you quietly savor the taste of that sorrow and joy, that sorrow and joy will no longer be real sorrow and joy, but will become what Buddhists call "Tathata," so sorrow is no longer sorrow, joy is no longer joy, and you become one with nature, one with the universe, and enter the realm of eternity. This is the sublimation and crystallization of human emotional life.</p>

<p>When the sky clears,</p>
<p>We should stroll along the paths:</p>
<p>The mud road, nourished by the rain,</p>
<p>Must be cool and gentle;</p>
<p>The small grass, flaunting its new green,</p>
<p>Has been washed clean of all dirt;</p>
<p>The little white chrysanthemums, no longer timid,</p>
<p>Slowly raise their heads,</p>
<p>Testing the cold, testing the warmth,</p>
<p>Then blossoming fully, one by one;</p>
<p>The butterflies, shaking off the water droplets,</p>
<p>Wander freely among the wooden leaves,</p>
<p>Exposing their ornate, colorful book pages,</p>
<p>Opening and closing them in the sunlight.</p>
<p>Let’s stroll along the paths,</p>
<p>When the sky clears:</p>
<p>Barefoot, hand in hand,</p>
<p>Treading on the new mud, wading through the stream.</p>
<p>The new sun pushes away the haze,</p>
<p>The stream ripples in the warm breeze,</p>
<p>Look at the moving dark green in the mountains—</p>
<p>Footprints—it’s also wandering leisurely.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Autumn Dream <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— ·Zhu Yan·</p>
<p>Autumn dreams are short, fragmented, yet faithful. As long as I close my eyes, my breathing becomes heavy, and the beat of my heart softens, she, like a leaf falling naturally in autumn, gently floats onto the silver screen of my brain and starts to move, never missing an appointment.</p>
<p>She seems to be searching for me everywhere with a lovelorn heart, trying to capture me. She comes from afar, across a vast wilderness, a deep and wide river, and through layers of smoky trenches; because she comes, she often takes me to those places as well. She is also a stubborn nostalgic, leading me to many years gone by; perhaps there are happy enjoyments, perhaps there are bitter reliving.</p>
<p>This statement is not wrong. Autumn dream—this lonely person's graceful demon, is indeed actively searching for me. Lying haphazardly on the bed, she happens to find me. Trying not to put my hand on my chest, she also comes. Even if I learn the sleeping posture of a monk during a period of abstinence, I still cannot reject her.</p>
<p>…On a late autumn evening, on the bank of a river surrounding a manor, a whole row of tall elm trees has already dropped half of its branches and leaves—elm trees are easy to wither; the red-stemmed reed catkins have completely turned white, and the tender yellow leaves are their clothes, arranged like a team on the water's edge. The threshing ground is directly opposite this riverbank with shady trees and white reeds, with a haystack shaped like a high-stacked steamed bun, standing neatly at the corner of the threshing ground, towering above the cliff. A spotted dog is curled up asleep below… As soon as this scene unfolds, my sister, who died many years ago, is talking to me in this quiet threshing ground:</p>
<p>"Brother! I will never go to the × family even if I die! I plan to study and go far away!"</p>
<p>I also say the same sentence forever:</p>
<p>"Rest assured! Get well first, and I will help you to the end!"</p>
<p>A smile appears on her pale face; two lovely red clouds of a consumptive patient appear on her cheeks.</p>
<p>I feel that when I want to say something else, I will naturally wake up! Rubbing my eyes, I think of the solitary yellow earth grave where only a winter holly tree has grown; this, indeed, is her final destination in the second year after she said those words. On the anniversary of her death two years ago, her niece was already worshiping an aunt she did not recognize under that winter holly tree.</p>
<p>Lazily watching the sunlight gradually dimming at the window, I don’t even have the heart to reminisce, fleeting and baseless daytime dream!</p>
<p>If the dream were more complete, or if it were smeared with a little cloud of hope, I would really open my arms to welcome her. But she is fleeting, fragmented, gray and dull, like endless falling autumn leaves, flying in piece by piece, scattering!</p>

<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>We felt that the work here in Guanfang was very simple and easy. The captain told us that we must launch the anti-Japanese movement at zero hour on the twenty-eighth, or at the latest by three o'clock before dawn, taking the "Security Team" as the main body and the puppet army as the secondary target. The captain ordered me and Tiger Brother to serve as special envoys for liaison with the Security Team. Tiger Brother and I spent only half a day finding a few key people (of course, those in slightly higher positions) and talking to them. Finding acquaintances was Tiger Brother's merit, and speaking was my job. Then we were responsible for two-way negotiations, conveying conditions, procedures, deadlines, etc. The captain and his subordinates had already carried out a lot of liaison work, so we were able to handle things very smoothly.</p>
<p>On the puppet army side, the personnel were too complex, and there was simply no discipline or system. At the same time, Tiger Brother and I knew too few people there. The matter was not so straightforward. We started by establishing a center in the Twelfth Regiment, but the conditions put forward by the leaders were too harsh, or rather, too outrageous. They demanded the general command, even the Security Team had to be under their command. This one was dropped. Secondly, they said that once the revolt was launched, they would have to preside over the administration and search and seize the property of the traitors. In other words, they wanted to rob for a while.</p>
<p>For these two conditions, there were many negotiations, back and forth twists and turns, and countless troubles, but we never reached an agreement. Most of these puppet troops were a rabble, vulgar, hooligans, miscellaneous troops from outside the pass who could not survive, and small groups of mountain bandits, etc.; in short, they were all fourth- and fifth-rate social scum. From this point, I suddenly thought of a person. He was a small group leader among our associates, with extremely wide connections in the underworld. He had some dealings with all kinds of people. He now lived in the Beiping Hotel, serving as a receiver and dispatcher in our organization. If he could spare some time to come here and lead the negotiations, he would surely succeed with his reputation from outside the pass.</p>
<p>I discussed this matter with the captain, and the captain immediately telegraphed the captain of the Beiping headquarters, asking him to send someone to bring that leader to me. The telegram said "Process immediately." That leader was delayed by something and only rushed here last night. After careful discussion, he spent most of the night inviting several key figures from the Twelfth Regiment of the puppet army to hold a secret meeting. As expected, he lived up to my expectations and reconciled the conditions of both sides. Regarding the uprising, suppressing traitors, maintaining order, resolving enemy forces in the city, defense, confronting enemy troops outside the city, liaison with our regular army, and other personnel matters, a list of duties was drawn up. In this way, although the liaison work was largely completed, the time was delayed by several hours. Everyone agreed that it would be launched at five o'clock tomorrow morning. In the hours before the launch, all the arrangements must be made strictly and thoroughly.</p>
<p>At this time, the clock was already pointing to 1:50 AM, that is, 1:50 AM on the 28th, only a few hours away, when the Japanese were about to launch the first act of the formal battle since July 7th—"Dawn Attack." According to intelligence, we knew that the Japanese army stationed outside Tongxian City had already been mobilized and ready around that time, and could open fire as soon as the time came. The most hateful thing was that this Twelfth Regiment of the puppet army caused so much trouble and delayed the time. If we could launch on time at the expected zero hour or three o'clock in the morning, such a major move in the heart of the Japanese would be a very meaningful and valuable action for both our military and political sides. It's just a pity that it's a few hours late!</p>

<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>Humans often have many laughable behaviors, which is to create stories to deceive themselves. This behavior is purposeful, aiming for subconscious satisfaction.</p>
<p>The execution of eleven Nazi war criminals in Nuremberg, under such heavily guarded arrangements, yet Göring managed to commit suicide calmly, avoiding the scene of being hanged, causing the person in charge to still be investigating, this news is stimulating enough, also sensational enough, but people are not satisfied, even saying that those who were hanged were straw men, and ten real criminals have already escaped justice. This legend is not necessarily an attack on leniency or other political conspiracies, but due to a kind of hero worship idea prevailing.</p>
<p>Saying that the Nuremberg hanging was all straw men, and saying that Hitler is still alive is the same idea. In the meantime, there are naturally all kinds of people with speculative motives using people's psychology and adding fuel to the fire, expanding the fabrication.</p>
<p>Whether in China or abroad, in ancient or modern times, there are such stories. In Shanghai, there were rumors about Yan Ruisheng changing his name and how he was doing; and after Water Margin there is Ping Yao Zhuan, after Dream of the Red Chamber there is A Continuation of Dream of the Red Chamber, after Romance of the Three Kingdoms there is Counter-Romance of the Three Kingdoms, the ancients were also like this.</p>
<p>Some also say that this is human nature, pitiful people pitiful actions.</p>

<p>— Zheng</p>
<p>This journal published a precious photo on the twentieth: a thirty-nine-year-old groom, Chalai, Biss, with his seventy-seven-year-old bride. This kind of thing is really shocking in the eyes of us Chinese. There are not a few shocking marriages in the world. First, look at the following "old news":</p>
<p>In 1936, there was an old man in Egypt, 130 years old, who was planning to marry a twenty-five-year-old girl. This old man had been married nineteen times, and all his wives had died of illness, leaving him with twenty-three children. These children strongly opposed their father's remarriage, believing that he was over a hundred years old, his physical strength had declined, and there was a difference of one hundred and five years between him and his intended spouse, which was not appropriate, and advised their father to be cautious so as not to regret it later. Unexpectedly, the old man firmly stated: "Although I am old, my health is still good." And he became very angry: "Marriage is my freedom! My children have no right to interfere!"</p>
<p>This old man was not only "not old at heart", but also stubbornly innocent. Such a thing is really hard to come by, because an old man of one hundred and thirty years old is very difficult to find. In the United States, there are quite a few couples with a large age gap. In 1937, a nine-year-old girl in Tennessee, Winsde, actually held a wedding with a six-foot-tall, twenty-two-year-old youth, John, which caused a national uproar, saying it was "barbaric", "terrible", and even "a national disgrace"! Pastors and social activists in Tennessee launched an "opposition movement", and the New York World-Telegram wrote a special commentary: "If we think of them as a group of degenerate mountain people, we will know that culture has not given them much help." But both parents gave permission, and their marriage was considered legal.</p>
<p>In Ohio, a thirteen-year-old girl, Ishan Bohr, married thirty-seven-year-old Henry. The girl's parents were so anxious that they immediately filed a lawsuit with the court, requesting that the marriage be declared invalid.</p>
<p>In Korea, wives are generally ten years older than their husbands. When a boy is born in a family, a ten-year-old child bride is hired for him. When the boy has not yet reached adulthood, the girl is already in a strong state of sexual desire. According to Korean customs, men can marry again and take concubines, while women are absolutely not allowed to remarry or have illicit affairs. Therefore, there are often tragic cases of killing husbands to seek sexual satisfaction.</p>
<p>Unprecedented Record</p>
<p>In 1935, the National News Agency of Belgrade reported: In Romania, a young man named Mania was arrested. Mania was only twenty-eight years old and had married eighty wives in five years, spending US$200,000. After each marriage, he defrauded the women of money and then abandoned them. Marrying eighty wives in five years, averaging almost one bride every twenty days, his method is "great", truly amazing.</p>
<p>A French woman named Ylibaumei married forty-eight men in ten years from the age of eighteen to twenty-eight, and divorced forty-seven times. Among her many husbands, there were lawyers, elementary school teachers, journalists, big businessmen, athletes, petty bureaucrats, doctors, artists, bankers... In terms of nationality, in addition to French, there were Americans, British, Germans, Indians, Japanese, Italians, Arabs, Russians, Turks, Jews, Yugoslavs... Among them, the longest she lived with was her last husband—a construction engineer. The shortest was only three days.</p>

<p>The Peasant: Ah, the country bumpkin, born at the wrong time. One "struggle" and all is gone, another "fight" and everything is lost. Though it is said the nation is built on "agriculture," the people live in poverty. "Freedom under the hoe," I ask you, have you really achieved "freedom?"</p>
<p>The Worker: Building a home with bare hands, relying on heaven for sustenance. One "strike" and wages increase, another "strike" and positions rise. Leading with "democracy," pioneers "for the people." The cost of living is only for our benefit. Labor is sacred, sacred labor.</p>
<p>The Merchant: Their hearts are venomous, their hands ruthless, as cunning as foxes, as sharp as tigers. They claim to "take righteousness as profit," but are actually "blinded by money." Handling things with strings attached, their responsibilities are important, manipulating for huge profits, the true nature of these people.</p>
<p>The Student: The grand gate is wide open, no money, no entry. "Learning" has become a "business," abandoning morality and forgetting shame. Between "teacher" and "student," ritual and righteousness are abandoned, and wealth is worshipped. Those with wealth but no learning can buy a diploma, those who study hard and research diligently must still spend money!</p>
<p>The Soldier: (1) Driving jeeps at high speed, pedestrians give way. Embracing beautiful women, heroes love beauty. "Robbing" what is taken, only a one-word mistake, guarding and "stealing" from within, how can benefits leak out? (Above, referring to high-ranking soldiers)</p>
<p>(2) Clothes do not cover the body, skinny and haggard, tying "hand grenades" to charge, brave and unparalleled, facing "machine guns" and sacrificing themselves, becoming cannon fodder. "The success of Yan'an is built on ten thousand bones," working for others. Pitiful bones on the outskirts of Zhangjiakou, all "recruited" common people. (Above, referring to low-ranking soldiers)</p>
<p>The Scholar: The long gown must be worn, losing face is unacceptable, being late for signing in is unacceptable, public affairs are important. The high official "kills" with "currency," the small official is "killed." Those above "command," those below "die."</p>

<p>— Jin Jiaping</p>
<p>When you do something, do you think it is your own voluntary action? No, you are passive. For example, you plan to take a trip. No one has ever suggested it to you. Everything is your own idea. But how did you come up with the idea of traveling? Analyzed, there are the following reasons:</p>
<p>(1) You have a holiday or free time.</p>
<p>(2) You feel bored and need to travel to adjust your mind.</p>
<p>(3) You travel because of your profession.</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, your vacation must of course be approved. You cannot arbitrarily designate a vacation. And even if you have free time, would you be interested or have the opportunity to travel during the rainy season, wartime, or extremely hot weather? Of course you can't or won't. Your motivation is caused by clear or pleasant weather. The reason for the second point of boredom may be because of the monotonous and busy work or something that makes you feel unhappy. For the third point, you are employed and travel. In short, you do something for a reason, and because of this reason you are passive.</p>
<p>The occurrence of anything in the world is due to the chain reaction of movements between things. When we are playing with building blocks, we line up many blocks, leaving a little space in the middle. We only need to press the first block on the second block, then one after another, this row of blocks will all be knocked down. When you are late for class and are questioned by the teacher, your reason is that the tram is too crowded. Isn't this a good example? If the tram were very empty, you wouldn't be late. If you don't trust me, this can be said to be voluntary, but you are still passive, because the idea of not trusting me occurred because you read this text. If I didn't write it, you wouldn't know me at all, and of course there would be no such thing as not trusting me.</p>
<p>Since everything is passive, who is moving it? Who is the active source? We know that the earth is a part of the sun. Its rotation without deviating from its orbit is due to the sun's gravity. Mankind relies on this gravity to grow. That is, human actions are controlled by the sun. But the sun is also one of the planets in the universe, and its movements (scientists have proven that the position of the sun is constantly moving) are also affected by the attraction of other planets. In this infinitely large universe, the movement of each planet responds to other planets. It is impossible for us humans to study the origin of the active in this mysterious and incredible universe. If you are a believer, you can say that everything is controlled by God, but, but what is the origin of God? That is another question.</p>
<p>Local Customs</p>
<h3 id="e200">It is indeed better to give birth to a son than to a daughter — The region where women are worth the least <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Gan Lai</p>
<p>In some circumstances, women have a very high status. "A smile worth a thousand gold," "A kiss worth a thousand gold," have become beautiful stories that shine through the ages. As long as a woman is not ugly, even in a recession, she will always be more resourceful than a man. Recently, the "Miss Shanghai" election held in this city required one thousand yuan for each vote. The champion with the most votes received a total of 65.5 million yuan, which greatly benefited the refugees, indirectly explaining that the value of women is ultimately beyond what we smelly men can achieve.</p>
<p>However, there is a place where women are regarded as the most lowly and worthless things: girls are buried alive as soon as they are born, or given away as free gifts.</p>
<p>Not a Strange Tale</p>
<p>What is described above is neither a foreign report nor an old custom that has disappeared. It is happening in today's Republic of China:</p>
<p>Xinxing County is a third-class county in Guangdong Province with a population of about 130,000 to 140,000. Its cultural backwardness, stubborn thinking, and peculiar customs have not changed at all to this day.</p>
<p>The deeply rooted concept of valuing men over women makes the women of Xinxing County regarded as animals inferior to cattle and horses. There, ordinary families frown and sigh when they have a daughter, and call for an unemployed old poor woman to come, treat her to a meal with wine and dishes, give her some money, and also say a lot of thank yous, asking her to take the baby girl away and send her to someone else to be a child bride or maid.</p>
<p>Equal to Cattle and Horses</p>
<p>If they encounter a kind-hearted old woman, she will really send the baby girl to the receiving family. When she grows up, she will become the family's daughter-in-law, always working hard and suffering bullying and abuse, living like cattle and horses. If they encounter a black-hearted old woman, she will take the child and go to a secluded place, first strip off the child's clothes, then throw the naked girl into the river. Passersby see it and think it is a common occurrence and do not interfere. Poor families have even more vicious methods of giving birth to a girl, doing it themselves and throwing their daughters into a "abandoned baby pagoda." The so-called "abandoned baby pagoda" is a hollow stone pagoda with a round hole near the top on the outside. Abandoned babies are thrown in through this hole, becoming buried alive. There are many such stone pagodas in Xinxing County. On average, each "abandoned baby pagoda" has at least two or three innocent girls born inside every day.</p>
<p>Everyone, please close your eyes and imagine: what a shocking and shameful picture this is!</p>
<h3 id="e201">Guarantee the Salaries of the Working Class and Promote Occupational Insurance <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Shui</p>
<p>"Unemployment" is more terrifying than poverty, sickness, or death. Like war, it is the most terrible thing in the world!</p>
<p>As long as you have a job, you can at least get a basic living. Soldiers, doctors will treat us; death, optimistic people see it very calmly. But what about "unemployment"? The basic living is interrupted, and no doctor will treat you. Even the most optimistic people will shake their heads and sigh.</p>
<p>Although some people express sympathy for the "unemployed," most are unable to help, and some only express sympathy. As for those employment agencies and the social services above, they are just thinking about introductions.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must promote "occupational insurance," to promote an institution that can not only introduce jobs but also provide living expenses for a family during unemployment. We must ask friends who currently have jobs to try to imagine the suffering of being unemployed, and work together with one heart, embracing the good intention of "everyone for me, me for everyone," to organize an "occupational insurance" institution!</p>
<p>Occupational insurance institutions are similar to other life insurance, etc., and also contain some spirit of cooperative undertakings, and are even more active, not only providing living expenses for the families of unemployed people who have been insured, but also undertaking the obligation of introducing jobs, as well as investigating the reasons for unemployment and assisting the unemployed to return to work.</p>
<p>In addition, we must also take on the obligations of job introduction and providing the minimum amount of living expenses for the unemployed who have not yet completed insurance procedures and paid insurance premiums. However, these living expenses must be repaid in installments from the date of employment.</p>
<p>If there is such an institution, wouldn't it be a great blessing for society? We look forward to it.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Handsome Harryman — The New US Secretary of Commerce <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— You Nan</p>
<p>After Wallace's departure, President Truman announced on the 23rd of last month that Harryman would take over as the US Secretary of Commerce. The following are the life events of this man.</p>
<p>Not a Bad Reputation</p>
<p>William Averell Harriman was originally a giant in the American railway and financial circles. In March 1941, he went to the United Kingdom as a minister to negotiate the extension of the Lend-Lease Act. In September of the same year, he led the American delegation, accompanied by former British Minister of Production Beaverbrook, to Moscow to formulate the Lend-Lease Aid Act between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. In 1942, he participated in the three-person meeting between Churchill and Stalin. In October 1943, he was ordered to serve as the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union. He had a good reputation in the Soviet Union. When he left the country, Stalin specially gave him two fine horses.</p>
<p>From Harryman's past experience, it can be proved that he is also an important figure on the American political stage.</p>
<p>A Rich Man</p>
<p>Harryman's father was also a well-known industrialist during his lifetime. He served as the chairman of two American railway companies and planned and built many railways. After his death, Harryman inherited a legacy of 25 million US dollars. Later, he lightly managed and used this huge amount of funds, resulting in his current position as the fourth richest man in the United States, with property too much to accurately estimate.</p>
<p>However, Harryman's life is very civilian. He often eats in small restaurants, and occasionally talks and laughs with street vendors informally. He has a good eloquence. His political enemies call him "a mysterious man."</p>
<p>A Fine Gentleman</p>
<p>He is very particular about clothing. He likes to wear gray-brown western cowboy clothes and also wears a wide-brimmed hat, which makes him look very handsome. In the past, he was listed as one of the top ten handsome men in the United States.</p>
<p>Harryman is a graduate of Yale University in 1913. When he was studying at the school, he often used summer vacations to work as a surveyor and a local firefighter. After graduation, he worked in the railway company headed by his father. He has a thorough research on cultural exchange and railway administration, so President Roosevelt often consulted him on railway administration matters.</p>
<p>Pretty Daughter</p>
<p>Wherever Harryman goes, he is mostly accompanied by a young and beautiful woman, who is his capable daughter, Kathleen. She takes care of all the housework for her father.</p>
<p>When Harryman took office as Secretary of Commerce, he issued a statement supporting President Truman and Byrnes's political views, and said that the development of American trade depends on the cooperation and peace of all countries in the world.</p>
