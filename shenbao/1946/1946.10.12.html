<h3>國民大會如期舉行　府令代表出席報到　彭部長盼各黨提出名單</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕國大召集令，十一日正式由國府文官處頒發，同時送達各代表如期集會，定十一月二日前報到。記者晚訪吳文官長鼎昌，張部長厲生，詢以各黨派名單尙未提出，國大如期召開，有無妨碍，吳·張兩氏答覆略同，據稱，國大之召開，係遵照政協決議，各黨派人士前來出席，隨時均可參加，國會當虛席以待，至候補人列席問題，因法律上無明白規定，且與事實上困難亦多，恐難實現。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕據國大籌備會副主任委員洪蘭友談，國大定十一月十二日召開，已確定不改，召集令國府前已頒布，本日係根據選舉法施行細則，由國府頒發報到通知，換言之，即前發召集令之補充通吿，現距開會期尙有一月，各地代表均可及時趕到，政府仍盼各黨派能早提出名單，交通工具自不生問題。又大會籌備工作正加緊進行，大體已就緒。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕國府十二日令，國民大會改定民國卅五年十一月十二日召開，前經明令公布有案，現在會期迫促，所有當選及遴定各代表，均應依照國民大會代表選舉法施行細則第八十九條之規定，於開會前十日內，即自本年十一月二日起，親自來京向國民大會代表報到處報到，並繳騐當選證書，除當選及遴定代表名單另行公布外，特此通吿週知。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕中宣部彭部長今晚八時發表談話如下，國民大會於本年十一月十二日召集，業經明令公布，現距會期只一個月，故政府將於明日公布國民大會代表報到日期，第一屆國民大會之職權，僅爲制定憲法，至於依據憲法規定之行憲機關，須於憲法頒佈後六個月內，舉行全國普選選舉召集之，此次國民大會之代表名額，總計爲二千零五十名，各黨派名額之分配，仍照當時商定之數目，現在會期迫促，希望各黨派能從速提出名單，俾由政府早日公布。</p>
<h3>孫科展期返首都　第三方面繼續斡旋和平　中共認和談須全面停戰</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕孫院長與第三方面數次接觸後，本定今日赴京，但據記者昨夜向孫公館探悉，孫氏行期尙未確定。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕民盟秘書長梁漱溟來滬後，民盟留滬各領袖曾在中華職業敎育社會談，會後梁氏曾往訪周恩來，惟談話時曾否有新建議提出，則無從獲悉。</p>
<p>第三方面留滬各領袖昨日曾在交通銀行再度集議，彼等所建議之三項辦法：（一）國軍無限期停止進攻張家口；（二）一切根據政協決議辦理；（三）重開政協綜合小組。聞事前曾通知司徒大使。</p>
<p>本市中共發言人陳家康昨日宣稱：周恩來氏於聞悉此二項辦法時，極表同情，並稱此即中共一貫之主張，彼本人「願追隨諸公之後，爲和平努力。」惟中共對政府停戰之決心，顯尙未能盡去疑慮之心，故陳氏仍謂：第三方面旣願斡旋和平，則政府進攻張家口之軍隊，應即撤回原防。此點若能實行，則蔣主席國慶演詞中所提三人五人二會同時舉行，中共亦願參加，共同討論此演詞中所指出之永久的全面的停止衝突之辦法。陳氏並不堅持召開政協綜合小組，惟强調不能於轟炸張家口時進行談判，且謂談判時必須先談全面停戰辦法。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕十一日和談仍停於靜止狀態中，共產黨昨所公佈之備忘錄，政府方面人士稱，內容列舉十一條，前後矛盾之處甚多，民盟擬提之折衷意見，現尙未見發表，梁漱溟赴滬後，傳將與周恩來面商，幷促其返京，京中同時傳民盟留滬代表，將與梁氏同車於十二日返京，並有周恩來亦將於明晚返京說，靑年黨李璜十一日晨於出席參政會駐委會後，曾與王世杰晤談，就和談問題有所商洽，四時半往訪吳鼎昌，張厲生，共產黨董必武，竟日無活動，對各報所傳周恩來即日返京一息不予證實。又調人馬司兩氏，亦無政治性活動，馬特使上午接見自靑飛京之柯克海軍上將及密勒海軍中將與穆華准將，中午與夫人應美大使白德華公使之請，前往午餐，柯克上將同往，二時饒伯森將軍自平抵京，往謁馬特使曁司徒大使，晚間宴請柯克，司徒大使，十時接見皮參軍宗敢，餘無活動。</p>
<h3>杜魯門賀我國慶</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十日電〕杜魯門總統頃致中國國民政府主席一電如下：「在此中華民國肇基之紀念日，余謹向閣下及全中國人民引伸美國人民誠懇之慶賀與善意」。</p>
<h3>魏德邁談話推崇蔣主席</h3>
<p>顧維鈞讚揚美方協助</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十日電〕魏德邁中將在中國國慶日，對中國人民之爭取民主以及蔣主席之領導，備致崇揚。同時，顧維鈞大使在華盛頓發表演說，讚揚美國協助中國進行恢復工作。渠稱：美國對華之慷慨援助，乃中美兩國間傳統眞誠友誼之另一表徵。中國人民深信，在未來歲月中，美國對此一友誼之貢獻，仍將與時並增。魏氏云：蔣主席正繼孫中山先生爲爭取自由而鬥爭，並謂：「余相信聯合各國如予以充分援助，則蔣主席將能解決該國當前之政治，經濟問題，而建立一愉快，繁榮，統一與民主之中國」。渠稱：蔣主席正以與戰時相同之堅忍精神，保護民主與自由之原則。魏氏認爲，中國人民戰時所作之貢獻，其他國家未能予以準確之評價。</p>

<h3>行總駁斥賴伽第亞　上海港口並無堆存貨物　運往外埠物資近數週來成績特佳</h3>
<p>〔聯合社本市十一日電〕行總今日發表聲明，對聯總署長賴伽第亞，昨在華盛頓招待記者會上所稱：「中國港口仍形擁塞」一節，予以駁斥，並列舉過去數星期工作情節及聯總中國分署長艾格頓來函以作證明。據行總所引上海運輸及房屋管理局致聯總之函內稱：行總九月間運至外埠救濟物資計九萬六千噸，在本埠分配者計二萬四千噸，目前因各項設施及手續均見改進，將來本外埠救濟物資分發數量每月可達十五萬噸。艾格頓上週亦曾致函行總，對其工作加以讚揚。據稱：運往外埠物資，已造成輝煌紀錄，過去五星期內行總所經手分發之救濟品，其成績之佳，足可引爲光榮。如此項成績能予何患保持，則嗣後無限制運輸物資至上海可早若干時實現。據此問分署稱：截至十月四日止一星期內，在滬所卸救濟物資僅一萬另六百十噸，然在同一星期自滬運至外埠者則有二萬八千七百八十八噸，在本埠分發者爲一萬另九百三十六噸。聯總署長所云上海碼頭堆積救濟物資二十四萬五千噸，其實只有二十萬噸，其中一半係自南太平洋美軍購下之剩餘物資，在未經清點及加以修理前，未便即加處置云。</p>
<h3>賴氏片面之報告</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十日電〕聯合國善後救濟總署署長賴伽第亞今日招待記者稱：中國各口岸你我仍形擁擠，聯總運華物資禁令，尚無早日撤銷希望。洛克斯將軍會親自調查中國貨物擁擠情形，謂目前尚有聯總貨物二十四萬五千噸堆存上海碼頭，此爲運華一百萬噸貨物食糧及藥品之一部份。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十日合眾電〕聯總中央委員某委員，頃控告賴伽第亞，利用聯總機構，以圖達其「個人政治野心」稱：如美國會運續進行調查，即將發現賴氏之低能與錯誤百出。賴氏企圖自聯總預算內撥出百分之二，劃作準備金，共用途則拒絕發表。</p>
<h3>克利浦斯夫人報告來華任務　心中有祖國亦有中國</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕英援華總會會長克利浦夫人，十一日上午十時舉行記者招待會，報告此來任務，與該會工作情況。據稱：此次來華，主要任務爲獲知中國近況及其戰後計劃，蓋每一關心中國情況之英國人民，對上述兩問題咸極關切。今日記者招待會，除夫人到場外，參加者尚有其愛女佩琪與該會秘書勒夫人等。記者發問頗多，克夫人首述此來感想稱：四年來在英擔任援華工作，對中國一切具在最高興趣，此次實地訪問，向所慕念之中國，至感愉快。次答覆各記者詢問，略稱：此次來華計劃，現尚難以說定，先擬至各地考察，回英向國人報告，援華會機構極龐大，工作人員逾八萬，自動參加工作者尚未計入，僅參加「每週一個辦士運動」者即達七十八萬人，日積月累，其數殊爲可觀，肯鑫自動捐款者，即幼齡學童，亦傾囊相助，殊啼感動。續述援華會之性質，說明參加此一機構者有極右派人士，亦有極左派人士，城鎮工商人士咸熱心捐　，捐款有多至數千鎊者，然大部份均爲經常捐助一先令一辦士者，實際上爲一代表英國全體人民之組織，在政治上完全獨立。</p>
<h3>捐款用途，英政府絕不過問，分配時除捐款者特別指定者外，該會亦不向中國方面作何指定。某記者詢以是否擬至共產黨地區視察？夫人答：此事須視時間與環境而定，現尚未作具體決定。並謂有關人宣傳中國無需救濟，援華會會向英人說明中國之情形及其需要救濟之切，英國工人對中國情形極關切，援華工作可使其增加對華之諒解與認識。</h3>
<p>〔路透社南京十一日電〕克利浦斯夫人今晨招待中外記者稱：五千家英國商行式廠之職工渝七十八萬人，每星期均慨捐若干辦士若干鎊，給與英國聯合援華基金會。並稱：余心中有余之祖國，亦有中國。</p>

<h3>糧食恐慌燃料缺乏　大連成死亡之城　蘇聯忙於搬物資坐視居民受凍餒</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京十一日電〕據近由大連來此者稱，大連在蘇聯控制下，糧食恐慌，燃料缺乏，今冬將成死亡之城。全市居民約一百萬，存糧無幾，而冬季奇冷，所有燃料，更不足以禦寒。日僑尤爲困苦，每日餓死用自盡者各有十餘人。自產區運輸煤柴及農產品至大連之鐵路，因戰事致交通停頓，，蘇聯船隻每星期雖有五六艘開到，但祇忙於搬運物資回國，不知解除民眾困苦，大連在名義上雖歸化人統治，實際則受蘇聯軍事當局指揮。城內蘇軍仍多，但似係後衛，居民在戰前僅六十五萬，現已增至近百萬人。自旅順等處來此之日人，數在二十五萬以上，多數失業，且缺乏糧食燃料。其也居民，亦同感此苦，多以廉價斥售衣物，購買昂貴之糧食煤斤，市內各大旅館，碼頭棧房，及百貨公司均由餓人經營，自年初迄今，他國輪船抵連僅六艘。從前冬季，停泊港內之船，有時多到十五艘，今每星期僅到五六艘而已，蘇聯在大連交無海軍，僅有巡船一艘，執行海港檢疫任務，惟陸軍似頗眾多，且有砲隊。大連方面有華人設立之「警察訓練學校」，畢業者分批赴共軍控制下之安東，每次約三百人。</p>

<h3>對義和約全部通過</h3>
<p>經過多月討論爭辯的對義和約，業於九日經巴黎和會全體大會全部通過。此一和約的通過，據合眾社電訊所云，「表示西方國家在蘇聯激烈反對之下，經十一星期之唇槍舌劍，卒獲最後勝利」；又云，「蘇聯在巴黎和會企圖將特港英美駐軍從速撤出，然和會否決，於是意大利和約之三大爭端，八日經最後投票，東方集團又與西方集團奮鬥，而東方敗績。」據報載消息，對義和約的主要部份包括：（一）特里雅斯特自由港在聯合國機構下的組立，（二）對義賠款數字的決定，（三）意大利保有軍備的限制及規定意大利放棄在華特權等三十六條。從各通訊社所傳來的消息，我們可以發現，就是在最後的刹那，蘇聯並不會放棄它原來的立場，而是實驗室的立場得不到多數的支持，以是遭到大會的否決。</p>
<p>對義和約的通過，還有待於各該政府的批准，始能生效。這是世界第二次大戰後最初成立的和約。意大利雖會參加軸心，其後鮑格里奧將軍及義王愛麥虞限第三亦會率軍歸降，一部意大利人民且曾參加聯軍對德作戰，故意大利的戰敗，未能與德日同科。惟其如此，所以德日目下正在盟軍的佔領下，而對義和約却已經巴黎和會全部通過。自從開始討論訂立和約以來，若干問題即環繞在對義和約上，如賠款問題，意大利舊屬地處分問題，軍備限制問題，其中特里雅斯特港問題，關係複雜，爭持最久。現在巴黎和會所通過的各條款，雖不一定全是英美的原議，且大都爲折衷方案，但究與英美的距離不遠，即此可見國際政治的動向，國際與情的歸趨。</p>
<p>從大體上講，這次對義所成立的和約，並不含有濃烈的報仇情緒，所定條款亦不過嚴。以視昔日第一次世界大戰後對德所訂的凡爾塞條約，誠不可同日而語。在對義和約開始擬訂的時候，蘇聯原曾要求分割意大利非洲屬地，向義要求賠款，支持南斯拉夫合併特里布雅斯特，反對陶德加尼斯　島的歸隸希臘。經過幾多次的調停爭辯，現在對義和約僅規定意大利對蘇賠款一億美元，對南斯拉夫及希臘各賠一億美元，對阿比西尼亞賠償二千五百萬美元，分七年繳付。此項賠款的數字，葉未必能滿足蘇聯的慾望，但有此規定，亦無非尊重蘇聯的意見。關於處分意大利舊屬地問題，和約不曾爲明確的規定，對義和約第七條稱：「關於意大利舊有殖民地之命運者，其中規定義國舊有殖民地在法理上之最後地位，將由四強在對義和約簽字後一年內解決之。」是則此項問題，巴黎和約並沒有解決，僅將此問題延到一個更長的時間，從容考慮。至於特港問題，蘇聯爲支持南斯拉夫而提出的建議，未被採納，所通過的却多少是與英美原意距離不甚遠的法國折衷案。所以從這些角度來看，蘇聯之參加此次巴黎和會，不得不認爲一種外交上的失敗。</p>
<p>在這次對義和約的條訂上，法國爲地主國，同時亦盡了最大的努力，法兼外交部長皮杜爾是戰後起來的一個嶄新人物，憑着他的智慧與才能斡旋調停於蘇聯英美之間，若說蘇聯參加此次巴黎和針是一種失敗，則在此次巴黎和會成功的却是戰後起來的第四法蘭西。特港問題固然多少依據了法國修正案而通過，在其它許多問題上，亦復多少依據法國所提的折衷案而通過，如關於意大利南斯拉夫邊界問題，便是依照所謂「法國綫」的劃分而經大會通過的。再生的法蘭西，在以天主教信眾爲骨幹的「人民共和運動」的領導下，如今却實踐了它歷史的使命。</p>
<p>至於我國在此次對義和約中所取態度的光明正大，尤應爲列國所崇敬。我王外交部長及郭代表泰祺先後就國際正義的立場，表示我們對戰敗國的關心，不主張向戰敗國索取超過其担負能力之非分賠款。對於意大利，不因意大利在庚子之亂時曾向我要索鉅額賠款，而心存報復，自動賠款要求。此種嚴正的立場，實足爲我民族增光。在對義非洲舊屬地處分問題上，我國代表又主張北非意大利舊屬地處比亞應予獨立。蓋北非一帶，原爲文化古國，當地居民之智訓水準較高，未能與非洲中部之居民相提並論，自應早日得以獨立，以滿足其人民之願望。此舉又爲我立國精神之崇高表現。目前關於處分非洲義舊屬地問題，雖還不曾有所解決，但我國這種扶植被統治民族使得以獨立建國的立場，應該值得尊重，未始不是解決北非問題的一種途徑。</p>
<p>對義和約是全部通過了，但和約本身未必即是和平的保障。如何能夠有持久和平的確保，應該是此後列強努力的鵠的。使此後世界能夠有持久和平的確保，那纔不致失了修訂對義和約的一番意義。</p>
<p>專論</p>
<h3>國民學校應如何實施二部編制？</h3>
<p>— 胡超倫</p>
<p>抗戰期間，各地慘遭兵禍，文化機關，摧殘殆盡，敵偽所辦之學校，因陋就簡，亦化爲不絕如縷罷了。勝利之後，所有流亡有後方的民眾，相率歸來，教育復員伊始，因爲校舍和設備的不敷應用，便發生了許多學生失學問題。在目前物價高漲，教費困難時期，一時添建大量校舍，購買大量設備，專實上確有困難。要想解決刻不容緩的失學問題，只有實施二部制，最爲簡捷易行。</p>
<p>此時提出這二部制的辦法的，首推八月十八日的申報社論，繼則見之於上海市教育局的試辦，而最近則教育部且有通令分飭各省市推行。可見這的確不失爲一種國民教育的救急辦法。其實二部制交不始於今天，民國二十六年六月，教育部曾頒布過一個實施二部制辦法；他說明二部編制，有左列各種：</p>
<p>一·全日二教室二部制—以二教室同時容納兩班同程度或異程度之兒童，由一教員往復施教。教室最好兩室相連，或作日字形，中間開門，以便教員來往。</p>
<p>二·全日一教室間時二部制—以一教室及一其他場所，（如運動場圍地圖書室禮堂等）同時容納兩班兒童，間時交替入教室，由一教員施教。其不直接受教之兒童。由導生自習，或作其他活動。</p>
<p>三·半日二部制—以一教室容納兩班兒童，分上下午教學，由一教員施教。是項二部制，分左列兩式：</p>
<p>甲·兒童全日在校者，半日在教室演習，半日半導生領導在其他場所自由作業或活動。</p>
<p>乙·兒童半日在校者，離校之半日，由教員支配課外作業，令兒童自習。</p>
<p>四·全日半日混合二部制—以二教室容納兩班或三班兒童，一班全日在校，餘兩班上下午交互在校。全日班與半日班之教學時間，須交互排配，半日班授課時，全日班應支配自習或課外作業。</p>
<p>五·間日二部制—以一教室容納兩班兒童，間日輪流施教；不直接施教之一班，應支配自習或課外作業。</p>
<p>二部編制，與普通的學級編制之不同，已如上述。在實施時，應該注意的問題，可以如下的三方面，加以說明。</p>
<p>甲·教育行政機關方面</p>
<p>一·在這一個小學區裏，究竟要否施行二部制？應該由主管教育行政機關予以確定。而確定的根據，就在調查學齡兒童。看這一個小學區裏，有多少失學兒童，除了必須增校增級以外，還有多少可以施行二部制教學；然後分配到原有學校裏，予以二部編制。</p>
<p>二·如果在這個學區裏，師資並不十分缺乏的話，二部制應該支配兩個合格教員。至少也要有一個合格教員，一個代用教員。否則，人手過少，困難　生，容易失敗。</p>
<p>三·實施二部制時，對於不直接施教的一班，應支配自習或課外作業。而自習與課外作業，需要圖書儀器，勞作用具，遊戲用具等等。故教育行政機關，應給予必不可少的設備經費。以資應用。</p>
<p>四·每級學生人數，二部編制要比普通班級增加一倍。一切辦公用費，至少也要增加百分之七十，所以教育行政機關，也應該就實際需要情況，加給辦公費。</p>
<p>五·實施二部制教學的教師，比担任普通班的教師責任重，工作忙。必須要挑選能力強，技術高，而富有服務精神者，方能勝任愉快。這些好教師，不易羅致。必須酌量提高其待遇，並給予一切精神上的鼓勵。</p>
<p>六·二部編制，因爲增加了一倍的學生，便減少了許多直接教學時間，必須以指導自習或課外作業，來彌補這個缺憾。所以課程教材日課表的編配，在爲重要。要解決這個問題，不僅是教師本身方面的事情。連研究進修機關，視察輔導人員，均要負責，通力合作，方可相輔而成。而總其成者，實爲教育行政機關。</p>
<p>乙·學校方面</p>
<p>一·二部編制的方式，已如上述。在學校方面施行的時候，還需要因地制宜，決定採用那一種編制方式。例如小學兒童數超過一級以上，而校舍設備敷用者，宜採用全日二部制，兒童數超過一級以上，而不能全日到校，且校舍設備不敷應用者，應採用間日二部制。兒童交通或家庭等關係，不能逐日到校者，宜採用間日二部制。教員教學上與兒童學習上，有特殊需要者，可採用全日半日混合二部制。</p>
<p>二·担任二部制的教師，對於課前準備十分充足，最好由教師把教材中必須直接教學部分，和可以自習部分，斟酌支配，編成簡單的教案，以便教學。同時對於學生自習，必須切實指導，使他不走進錯誤的途徑，還要嚴加考核，證驗他自習的成績如何。</p>
<p>三·全校教職員，應通力合作，不分畛域，盡自己的可能，帮助二部制學級。這一種帮助，不僅限於物資上的帮助，把全校可能應用的場所和設備，儘量分給二部制應用而已。還要把二部制遭遇到的困難問題，帮助解決，並予以工作上的援助，精神上的鼓勵。</p>
<p>丙·學生家長方面</p>
<p>一·身爲家長者，最感痛苦的是子女失學問題。當此大戰之後，學校校舍大成問題，學校物質配備極度缺乏，祇有實施二部制，方可臨時救急，解決目前的失學問題。並且要明瞭二部制行之得法功效並不在普通編制之下。學生家長不但不宜發生懷疑態度。</p>
<p>二·教學技術之優劣，在乎運用之得法與否，不得其法，呈師生終日相對，還是一無所獲。二部編制的教學情況，自與普通學級略有不同。學生家長要明白二部制之妙用，就在能指導自習和課外作業。決不能視爲放任，視爲浪廢時間，而詆毀學校的不是。</p>
<p>三·學生家長明白了上面所說的兩點之後，二部制學生在家時，誚由家長注意，督促自習，並予以充分的指導，以補教師之不及。</p>
<p>二部制原以推行義務教育，而經教育部明令實施。十年來，因受戰事影響，收效未宏。今日勝利歸來，正可以二部制濟強迫入學之用，不僅在救濟目前的兒童失學而已。茲當推行之初，用作此文，以就天上於賢達。</p>

<p>補充渡輪五年計劃</p>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>茲閱上海市渡輪公司的五年計劃，覺有未盡善處，　將鄙見二點，補述於後，希該公司採納。</p>
<p>（一）請再增開浦東大棧到公平路的對江渡綫，因此處自浦東大道渡浦往虹口一帶的男女工人以及菜販，甚爲眾多，於戰前則有墳山碼頭與小南洋碼頭的渡綫，今此兩綫，皆已無存，如此重要渡綫，亟應尅日恢復，以利眾生。</p>
<p>（二）公司方面，僅計劃卡軍過江綫，這恐給於浦東市面的繁榮，尚屬有限，必須計劃建造特種渡輪，以開卡車卸貨，及公共汽車載客過江綫，如此則浦東或浦西貨棧內的貨物，祇要載上卡車，可以通行無阻，乘客搭上公共汽車，就可到目的地下車，（如此浦東洋涇鎮到中正路大世界，大世界到周浦）。可免上船落船自行渡浦的麻煩。給予浦東市面的繁榮，就無限量矣。（陸龍龍）</p>
<h3>代郵</h3>

<p>覆某君</p>
<p>關於江都長途汽車售票舞弊一事，頃得江都縣政府函復略稱：「查原件所稱每票多收二百元一節，係因本縣交通破壞紊亂，遠於極點，故自軍黨政暨地方人士，奉令組織水陸交通管委會，每票附加二百元公益捐，以充改善交通等項費用，尚無浮收，除轉函該會切實整頓售票查票，不得再有上項情事發現外，相應函復」，同日又據該縣水陸交通管理委員會函復稱：「查由揚州至六圩及六圩到仙女廟票價均有規定，雖行駛路綫各汽車公司或有不同，然票價均受敝會監督」云云，併復。</p>

<h3>共軍失敗命運早已註定　蘇北再生記　被脅從農民已獲助歸耕　金融待理交通積極恢復</h3>
<p>〔本報鎮江十一日電〕蘇北局勢自國軍於上月收復宿遷，泗陽，攻克共軍蘇北根據地淮陰，並肅清淮安附近殘餘共軍後，整個蘇北局即完全改觀。</p>
<p>蘇北共軍在淮陰宿泗一再失利後，最後在淮安曾舉行一次重要軍事會議，尚擬確保運河，掌握淮南物資，以圖作最後掙扎，終以定局動搖，一隅難安，仍歸失敗。</p>
<p>據熟知蘇北共軍內情者稱：蘇北共軍因在七八兩月間抽調十五團精銳兵力，轉進魯南魯西，協助山東共軍陳毅部，威脅徐州開封，運河沿綫及襄下河共軍，兵力早感不繼，宜有今日。國軍於上月初肅清豫東開封及　西曹州濟寗各地共軍，掌握臨海東路扣，魯南共軍與蘇北共軍之聯絡綫即告中斷，因此自九月中旬起，魯省共軍倚賴蘇北供應之食糧棉花即無法取得，蘇北共軍亦發生械彈兩　之極大恐慌。失敗之命運於以註定。</p>
<p>蘇北共軍連續敗挫後，軍心動搖，楚歌四面，已呈朝不保夕之頹勢，九月下旬，其高級指揮部倉皇向鹽阜撤退時，對外之通訊聯絡，因電台人員沿途易服脫逃，無人負責，告中斷，故當國軍於十月六日下午進入寶應縣城時，城內共軍首腦及政工人員尚在慢條廝理，開會討論固守寶應，支援高郵共軍之辦法，不圖會尚未終，城外東南兩面國軍之衝鋒號角已隱約可聞，守城共軍遂鼠竄而去。</p>
<p>最可笑者，向以賣狗皮膏藥爲能事之共軍政工人員，竟先其部隊，換着農民服裝，悄然遠遁。據聞寶應城外與國軍遭遇被俘之共軍，其中一部所謂「民兵」被執後，均搶地呼天，大喊冤枉，並哀聲哭叫曰我們不是什麼民兵，我們都是安分守己種田的老百姓，被共產黨騙來抓來充砲灰，現在這班害人的共產黨，上午聽到中央軍的砲聲就逃走了。聞此輩被共軍裏脅之良民，一經國軍訊明後，當即開釋，並酌給衣服用川資，助其還鄉歸耕。</p>
<p>寶應縣長沈乃庚係於六日下午隨國軍進城，現正撫輯流亡，趕辦善後，寶應城內食糧奇缺，鄉間仍有散匪，前日由揚泰兩地還鄉之第一批義民已到達寶應，今日第二批還鄉義民已分由揚泰啓程。</p>
<p>首先進入高郵之國軍爲×××師之陳旅，該部國軍因在最近二月中曾受嚴格訓練，服裝整潔，紀律嚴明，士兵以法幣向商民購物者，悉憑商店以銅元比值易貨，軍民之間一無隔閡。</p>
<p>高郵寶應邵伯各地幣制現甚紊亂，有以銀元折價者，有以銅元代值者，亦有以法幣代替「抗幣」稍稍提高其比率者，軍民均感不便，望財政交通兩部趕速收拾「抗幣」，急運大宗小額法幣至收復區，統一蘇北幣制，趕快通郵通匯，減輕人民之痛苦，此爲今日蘇北收復區之唯一急務，要趕快的辦，切實的辦。蘇北人民苦夠了，不能再使他們傷心痛心。</p>
<p>揚州到高郵已於九月通航，高郵寶應之水運亦於昨日恢復，聞鎮江四公司即擬派輪試航清江浦（即淮陰），預計一週後清鎮交通即可暢通，公路現正由建廳計劃修復中。</p>

<h3>華府二次照會蘇聯　美堅持對韃峽立塲　美有權參加修訂蒙德婁約　土耳其仍應獨負保衛重任</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十一日廣播：今日美國第二次通知蘇聯，請其停止干預韃靻尼爾海峽。並在新照會中提出警告稱：茍蘇聯攻擊此一軍略重要之水道，或以攻擊相威脅，則將請聯合國安全理事會採取行動。美國務院在此一措辭有禮而堅決之照會中，完全支持土耳其反對蘇聯所提蘇土聯合控制海峽之要求。國務院似欲愼重聲明其堅決立塲，故將上次照會中之每一節文字，幾完全予以重複提出。官方消息靈通人士云，新照會係在杜魯門總統與陸海軍部長會商後加以核准，其中明白指出美國之重要利益，不惟及於地中海且達全世界。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十日電〕美駐蘇大使史密斯昨以本國政府照會一件，送達蘇聯政府，說明美國對上月廿四日蘇聯致土耳其備忘錄之反響。照會中重申美國爲有關土耳其海峽地位之一國，任何關於蒙德婁公約（即保持土國海峽中立地位之條約）之修正美國理應參與其事。美國此項照會同時送達該約簽字各國，即英·法·蘇·土·希·羅·南（日本及保加利亞除外）。照會中指出英美蘇爾此在波茨坦會議時，同意海峽地位有調整必要，調整之方法即修訂蒙德婁公約。會中承認三國全體關切海峽地位及其可能的變更。是以蘇聯備忘錄中所謂海峽地位僅與土耳其及黑海沿岸各國有關一節，美國碍難同意。依照波茨坦決議，蘇聯與土耳其所可舉行之談判，僅爲初步交換意見性質，俾爲日後全體國家會議之準備。美國敢本友誼精神，坦白聲明曰：土耳其仍獨當保衛海峽之重任，他日海峽倘遭受直接或迫切的威脅時，儘可向聯合國安理會申訴。</p>
<h3>和會討論對保和約　會場座位五之四虛懸　維辛斯基猛烈抨擊英美　發言興奮竟將杯水撥翻</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十一日廣播：今日下午和會全會對保加利亞和約，作一般性之討論，半圓形代表席中，五分之四之座位空懸，波·澳·加·阿比西尼亞代表全體缺席。美代表卡弗萊贊同巴爾幹委員會所採對保各項決譏，謂所定一億兩千五百萬元之賠款額頗爲合理云。蘇代表維辛斯基繼起發言，發言熱烈，音調顫抖，繼且揮舞其雙手，竟將杯中飲水潑翻於譯員頭上，引起哄堂大笑。</p>
<p>又訊：維辛斯基首對英美對保所持立場，施以劇烈批評，認爲保加利亞不應視作盟方參戰國，但對民主的新保加利亞則讚頌有加。對於希臘政府，渠認爲在政治上頗見落後，其外交政策亦有疑問。關於對保和約第一條規定應割土與希臘一節，維氏大爲反對，謂希臘如將此項建議提交和會全會，則應予以駁斥，因其含有侵略意味故也。對希臘賠償條款，渠亦表示反對，謂應重交四强外長會議解決云。</p>
<h3>美决協助保衛希臘</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十一日廣播：美國代表今日在和會中發表意見，聲稱，美國將參加聯合國保護希臘之任何措置，以防希臘之安全遭遇侵略國威脅。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十一日廣播：今日南斯拉夫在和會全體大會中，要求美國軍艦離開地中海東部，英軍立即退出希臘。</p>
<h3>波希代表發生爭論</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十一日電〕和會全會本日午前九時四十分陸續舉行，由貝爾納斯主席，討論對保加利亞和約。以整個書，是爲和會討論之第三件和約。會議開始，斯拉夫國家集團之波蘭即重提要求，將希臘愛琴海畔狹長地帶讓予保國，魏氏係在演說中提此要求，並抗議和會委會建議拆除保國對希邊境之武裝，及保國對希南兩國各賠款六千二百五十萬美元，並稱：「波蘭人同情保加利亞，因吾人乃斯拉夫國家，然想像中之斯拉夫國家集團，並不存在。有人不喜此等民主共和國，保加利亞即其一。彼等準備利用任何方法以破壞之，如越權干預各該國內政及在國際加以歧視是」。希臘總理蔡爾達里斯立即答言，力促和會將保國邊境狹長地區一方劃讓希臘，籍以保障色雷斯區，以防可能的侵略，並責難西方各國對邊界問題讓步，不知感謝希臘之戰功。並稱，按照和約條款，保國第二次對聯合國交戰之後，反較從前更爲强大。</p>
<h3>對羅和約表决通過</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十日電〕和會今日以十五票對六票通過美英建議，規定多瑙河自由通航，羅馬尼亞和約全部條款因吿完成。表決時，斯拉夫集團各國投反對票。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十日電〕和會今晚討論羅馬尼亞和約時，斯拉夫集團與英美各國間，曾因多瑙河自由航行及巴爾幹通商問題發生衝突。蘇外長莫洛托夫讚貝文之後發言，攻擊所謂「金元民主」，指責英美與巴爾幹前敵國通商要求「最惠國」待遇，謀在巴爾幹實行其「帝國主議野心」。</p>
<h3>安理會推進工作　英提出意見五點　葛羅米柯在紐約州商會演說　力爲五强否决權辯護</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十一日電〕聯合國安全理事會英代表賈德幹，在「自由世界」雜誌發表一文，對「蘇聯及其盟國」在安理會中提出各項申訴，表示遺憾。據稱，各大國互相指責，殆無異在此和平機構之墻壁未乾時，即加以最重大之壓力。足値吾人注意者，即安理會十一國代表，至今無一對大會進展表示滿意。賈氏特提出下列五點，使安理會工作發生效力：（一）各國於開會前，應先經協商調解，使意見一致。（二）否決權不應時常使用。（三）迅速完成軍事及經濟計劃，以支持安理會之決議。（四）對安理會可能進行之事宜，作建設性之努力。（五）勿使安理會被用作宣傳機關。</p>
<p>〔中央社級約十日電〕安理會蘇聯代表葛羅米柯今日於紐約州商會特別會議中，向紐約五百商業鉅子致詞，並爲五强否決權有所辯護。葛氏之言，係隱然對批評五强否決權者之答復。渠重申聯合國之基礎，即在五强意見之「一致」。渠並警吿稱，任何改變五强否決權之努力，將使此世界組織陷爲「軟弱與無能」。葛氏今日於聯合國致詞時亦稱，蘇聯代表團反對任何修改聯合國憲章之企圖，且指出憲章條款爲聯合國粗織之骨幹，整個組織均由其支撑，故必須爲不能變更之法律。葛氏對聯合國之前途表示樂觀，渠解釋稱，蘇聯不但爲聯合國之會員國，且亦爲聯合國之創始者，此一事實已足說明樂觀之理由。蘇聯深信如會員各國確立加强聯合國組織，發展國際合作，及加强世界各國之睦鄰關係，則聯合國可以成爲爭取和平之有價値之工具。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社柏林十日電〕盟國管制委會昨今兩日舉行會議，檢討德戰犯之减刑請求，出席四國代表，即法佔領軍司令柯尼格將軍，英佔領軍司令杜格拉斯空軍上將，美佔領軍司令麥克那尼中將及蘇聯佔領軍司令沙柯羅夫斯基上將，由柯尼格主席。當將德戰犯十六名之减刑申請，一一加以檢討，認爲各犯罪有應得，無减輕可能，最後決定所有申請一概不准。沙河羅夫斯基於會議結束時宣稱，「本人職責所在，有須聲明者，即本人與紐倫堡國際法庭蘇聯法官尼基欽柯將軍見解從同。余以爲德戰犯沙赫特·巴本及弗里轍三人，不應開釋而應判罪。赫斯則不應處無期徒刑而應改處死刑。同時，希特勒政府德國參謀部及德軍總司令部各機構均應定罪。查國際法庭審訊之際，證明沙赫特在經濟部長任內，帮助希特勒進行財政與經濟侵略；弗里轍與故宣傳部長郭培爾沆瀣一氣，以納粹宣傳毒化德人，歷有年數；前任大使之巴本亦爲虎作倀，證據確鑿。夫此三人者豈得謂爲無罪。以舊赫斯，曾爲希特勒之黨代表，納粹政權第三號要人，對於納粹一切罪惡均負責任，豈可從輕發落。世界與情對於此人定議之向背，及蘇聯代表所取保留態度，證明法庭對於此人判決不當」。管制會並決定判刑各犯，於本月十六日在紐倫堡執行絞決。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十一日電〕法國已請英美蘇三國組織國際專家委員團，以設立司法機構，處置經紐倫堡法庭宜布爲犯罪團體之四納粹組織之人員。法政府致三國政府之照會有謂，禁衛軍等納粹團體已經宣布爲有罪，其領袖亦經判刑，料其他人員亦必與戰爭罪行有關，復希望德國之四佔領區當局能合作逮捕戰犯。</p>

<h3>美陸軍新火箭不日問世　陶威士談新太平洋政策　德式V2火箭第十二次試射</h3>
<p>〔聯合社珍珠港十日電〕太平洋艦隊司令陶威士在華盛頓與杜魯門總統及海軍高級將官會議後，今日在此宣布美國海軍新太平洋政策，謂美國海軍應自阿留申以至關島，建立堅强基地。關島前哨基地之重要性，不下於夏威夷海軍基地，久己成爲美海軍力在太平洋方面之象徵。美海軍此後應在阿拉斯加，阿留申羣島，夏威夷及馬里亞納羣島集中永久海軍設備，如軍艦及海軍航空基地之類。陶氏並稱：軍艦飛機之活動性及航程甚大，故吾人前哨基地須越過珍珠港，深入太平洋，始克有濟。前在華盛頓時，曾與軍令部長尼米資討論此事，尼氏深表贊同。至於阿留申新基地何時開工建造，陶氏則不願宣佈</p>

<h3>麥帥是活神　是神武始皇轉世　日報撰文闢謬說</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京十一日電〕日本數百萬民衆對麥帥崇拜日甚，東京自由派報紙時事新聞今日發表社論，警吿日人不應將昔日對天皇之無上尊敬轉移於麥帥，麥帥不可視爲「活神」，僅可視爲民主之代表與象徵。「麥帥傳」一書在日本行銷八十萬册，此爲日本投降以來最暢銷書，其影響未必盡善。日人心目中以爲新日本之一切遭遇，以至海外運來之一粒食物，均操於麥帥之手。日人並坦白承認：若無麥帥，若輩對前途須抱無限之隱憂。一部份日人讀麥帥傳而大受感動，竟有訊其爲「活神」者，有認爲日本建國始祖神武天皇轉世者。打破日人二千年來之英雄崇拜觀念，走向民主之第一步，必須從心理上開始云。</p>
<h3>美政府與人民不信任共產黨</h3>
<p>— 特約記者陳亦著述</p>
<p>〔本報紐約九月二十二日航訊〕美國對中國目前的政治軍事爭端以及經濟紊亂，究竟採取怎樣的態度？</p>
<p>在像美國這樣一個民主國家內與論對於政府的政策，往往起重要的作用。堅强的領袖像故總統羅斯福這樣的人，可以領導輿論，但決不敢違反輿論。至於杜魯門總統，他是根據民間的一般趨勢來決定其政策的。</p>
<p>美國人一向認爲他們是中國人的友人。從沒有一個國家，從沒有一個民族像中國這樣獲得美國人的同情和善意的。至於在實際的物質援助方面，中國在戰爭期間所獲的資助，與英國和蘇聯相較，僅屬租借方案項下極小的一部份。在戰爭結束一年後，傳說已久的對華五憶元戰後建設借款依然懸而未決，雖然在數量上和美國對英三十七億五千萬借款和對法十七億五千萬借款比較起來，還是很渺小的。</p>
<p>美國對中國興趣甚爲濃厚</p>
<p>但是美國對中國的興趣，一向是極濃的；美國主要軍人政治家馬歇爾將軍之被派來華担任調人，美國報紙電台对於中國內爭之注意，全國各地辯　論國共兩方優劣時參加者的踴躍，都足以說明這一點。</p>
<p>但是情形並不如此單純。對於美國人，中國依然是一切外國中最不易瞭解的國家。他們對於中國當前的情形，極感混亂，且不解美國政府的政策。</p>
<p>民主政治必須付出的代價之一，就是必須有代表各種思想的團體存在。由於輿論之重要，各團體必須設法轉移輿論，使它對本身有利。美國的共產黨和左翼份子，一向利用它來形成一個對蘇聯和共產黨綏靖的政策。</p>
<p>一般地講，美國人民並不喜歡共產黨。他們所以容忍共產黨，就是根據他們的民主哲學。認爲每一個人都有其自己選舉政治思想的權利。但是爲了共產黨不斷在國內煽動罷工，和對蘇及其附和國家的外交上不斷遭遇困難之故，美國人已經愈來愈覺得憤怒了。美國的法律，已有阻止共產黨在政府中任戰的規定，美國陸軍亦拒絕任命共產黨員爲軍官。</p>
<p>但是美國國內對於共產黨雖有種種限制和反感，可是許多美國人却對中國的共產黨表同情。這似乎令人百思不解，可是有理由的。</p>
<p>美國共產黨竟爲中共張目</p>
<p>美國的共產黨及其附和者進行了一次贊成中國共產黨的最成功的政治鬥爭。他們宣傳中國共產政權的效能和忠實，稱之爲民主的，並且讚揚它的土地改革。他們已經使許多美國人相信中國共產黨是中國僅有的民主進步份子，而是獲得中國人民支持的。</p>
<p>在另一方面，這個左翼想思集團破壞中國國民政府的努力，也獲得成就。他們指責我們的政府和領袖無能力。無效能，腐敗和不民主，他們利用種種對中國政府不利的事實和事情來鞏固他們的立塲。李公樸和聞一多之被暗殺，被指爲國民黨秘密警察所作，共產黨勢力之擴充，則被認爲是政府弱與不獲民衆擁戴所荏致，他們說：假如美國不再予以支持，那麼中國國民政府的崩潰，是數星期內的事情。</p>
<p>美國人民也不明瞭他們政府在中國所採取的政策。他們不懂美國軍隊爲何依然留駐中國，他們不喜歡被捲入中國內爭的漩渦。他們不明瞭聯合政府爲什麼不能成立，並且像他們的杜魯門總統一樣，他們天眞地相信中國的聯合政府將造成和平和統一。</p>
<p>現實的美國人則說：今日中國政府必須表現其力量，努力恢復國內秩序，並且改善人民的經濟條件。中國在實行孫中山先生的民生計劃和改善人民生活方面，將獲得美國人民充份的支持，因爲美國人民是不喜歡中國成爲另一個極權共產主義的國家的。</p>

<h3>空軍運輸機試飛失事　美籍機師四人無一生還　寶山西鄉尋獲殘骸</h3>

<h3>工程計劃團　侯家源談話　滬渝直達公路必須積極興建　京滬間將築超級公路　擴充渝漢間原有路基</h3>
<p>據行政院工程計劃團侯家源團長談稱：在國內鐵路，航空航運，未能普遍發展時期，公路之重建，實屬迫不容緩。據本團考察結果，滬渝直達公路，必須積極興建，俾便利各地物資得能輸入內地，徜能完成，則今後長江淺水時期，運輸困難，亦可迎刃而解。至渝漢間原有公路，因沿途橋樑損毀過多，非但路基大部均遭破裂，且路面亦甚狹窄，兩車不能併行，是以決定計劃重建，就原有路基加以擴充，俾能四輛卡車同時行駛，此項工程計劃書，本團正在擬訂中。其次爲京滬滬杭公路之修復，京滬公路現決興建爲超級公路，路面將用土瀝靑所舖填。滬杭公路現僅可勉强通車，橋樑及路面均須調換。至於西南各公路，一俟京淪直達公路完成後，當可貫通，且京杭國道亦已修復，全國各地之公路網完成有期，幷將與海港，車站，及機塲相啣接，其運輸能力，當可普遍發展。</p>

<p>（一）在抗戰期間，不動產之買賣，是否有現行法律之根據，可按原價收回之？（二）兄弟四人，未經析產，由其中一人出賣，此契約是否生效？（三）乙丁在從軍期間，其財產，政府是否有合法保障之規定？（四）查上開田山，均至卅一年尚是舊業主戶名之完糧串紙，是否可作收回之根據？（五）本受業對方現均未能到戶，可否申請辦理登記手續，或請律師代登地方報紙聲明無效？</p>
<p>〔曹亞俠律師答〕（一）不可。（二）不能。共有物之處分。應得共有人全體之同意，若無全體共有人之同意，而與他人締結買賣財產契約者。則該契約不能認爲有效。（三）政府有「優待出征抗敵軍人家屬條例」之規定。可據以辦理。（四）可作爲證明該財產於民國卅一年前係舊業主所有。（五）除可向辦理地政機關及刊登廣告聲明前情外。應向法院提起確認買賣契約無效之訴。</p>

<p>〔曹亞俠律師答〕（一）如公開進門，親族皆知之屬實外，並有公開舉行結婚之相當儀式，在法律上方能作爲重婚之證據。（二）僅能爲在配偶而與人通姦之證，但本罪若　縱容或有恕者，不得告訴。（三）能。若以對方重婚或與人通姦之情形作爲理由，而向法院請求離婚者，但本件依法已不得訴請，因上項情形，如於事前同意，或事後有恕，或知悉後已逾六個月，或自其情實發生後已逾二年者，均不得向法院請求離婚。（四）應由父鑒證，若另有約定者，從其約定。（五）生效。據上述應有二人以上證人之簽名。</p>

<p>統建公司總經理朿雲章云照統建現有紗錠，每日可出紗一千三百件，布二千疋，但限於電力，現僅出紗八百餘件，要求可能範圍以內，再行減少用戶電力，俾可增加生產，減輕成本，吳市長對此甚表同情，而論公用君迅擬核減用戶用電方案，切實施行，至各工廠停工時間，可將電力輪流使用，庶無浪廢。</p>
<p>王啓宇</p>
<p>六區棉紡織公會王啓宇報告一月來民營紗廠聯合配紗詳情，謂係光配實銷廠家，次及號家惟以素有往來爲限，至棉紗黑市之由來，實由於實銷暢旺，生產有限，求過於供所造成現全國紗廠現開紗錠二百四十萬錠，每日產紗六千包，與戰前錠數相較，尚不及半數，其開配價格，悉遵平價意旨，如二十支紗自一百四十萬元逐漸減低至一百三十萬元，第二次經調整爲一百五十五萬元，但黑市已超二百萬元，欲求紗價平抑，唯有增加生產，方得供求平衡，民營紗廠方面，業正對此勞力云云。</p>
<p>潘士浩</p>
<p>染織業潘士浩云，紗布市價之高漲，以及黑市之發生原因自有多種，平抑紗布價格之方法，誠如市長所云，須顧及廠商成本及商號合法利潤，一面儘量增加生產，以求供求之平衡，惟欲求供求平衡，按照目前情形，自非急切可以達到，此點殊值得重視，目下棉紗聯配以市區各紗廠爲限，紗廠似未必感到公允，應注意染織及紗號布號等業，自受廠偽強迫徵購紗布，資產蕩然，且目下利息高昂，委係無力囤貨抬價，上星期六統建開了之布，本星期一削價出售，可爲明證，本人兼爲棉布業之代表，知之較詳，至於紡建及紗廠之配紗，外邊確有閑話，如能許公會與聞，流弊可望減少，可惜當局不能及早採納。</p>
<p>周家聲</p>
<p>紗號業周家聲云，紗業自外匯變率，統建即未有配給，民營紗業聯配，亦少配着，而市上黑市紗不絕，深爲不解。</p>
<p>李道發</p>
<p>毛巾被毯業李道發云，統建說對該業專配十六支紗，而數量甚少，請認真加配，經朿總經理解釋，因統建可紡十六支紗之機件甚少，且多紡十六支粗紗，成本統扯亦須加高，因之出產無多，開配自少。</p>
<p>針織業徐侯云，配紗各廠一律，數又甚少，目下停工者紛紛，製品不應求，希望按照各廠生產機能，爲適當之供應，後由統建朿總經理及六區王啓宇氏對於各業所陳，加以辦正。</p>
<p>吳市長</p>
<p>最後吳市長云，已往之事，可以不究，現決定辦法如下：</p>
<p>（一）紗廠應迅速將生產設備，生產數量，市貨數量，及上月份配售實況，造冊報告。</p>
<p>（二）棉製複製品工業應迅速生產設備，上月份購紗實況，及今後需要情形，造冊報告。</p>
<p>（三）紗號棉布號，應迅將上月份銷數及戶名，暨應得合法利潤數，造冊報告。</p>
<p>再工廠用電，據公用局趙局長云，最近已分向救濟總署要求配給發電機三座，電力公司原有之「千五百磅發電機一座，及聯總投標之二萬四千瓦瓩之發電機，暨電力公司運美修理之發電機，」俟全部運滬，電力自無問題云。</p>
<p>王部長　本市棉布價格一再暴漲，影響民生至鉅，行政院長宋子文氏日前在滬時除而論吳市長確切負責抑平外，並召見紡織業鉅子朿雲章·吳味經及民營紡織業榮鴻元等，劉切論示協助政府平抑布價，在宋氏離京赴青時，復令經濟部長王雲五氏協助吳市長穩定布價，王氏業於昨晨自京抵滬，當日下午三時許，親赴統建公司視察一回，聞今日中午十二時半，將應吳市長之邀，在吳市長寓邸午膳，屆時統建公司總經理朿雲章，亦將參加。又今日下午三時，王部長又將親出席主持統建公司之董事會云。</p>
<h3>配售人造絲　統建昨爲最後一次　以後將由中央局信託負責</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕統建公司，代理敵偽產業處理局配售人造絲，上週四本爲最後一次。惟昨日人絲市況，又形蠢動。統建公司應處理局之請，再代理配售一次，配價照舊，惟數量已增加至五百餘箱。計一千六百餘包，聞配售辦法，係以絲織廠佔優先。大致每有織機二台，可配到一箱。據統建公司業務處處長蔣迪先稱：此爲最後一次之配售。統建公司以自身業務繁忙，無暇兼顧。下週起，人絲配售事宜，將悉由中央信託局辦理云。</p>
<p>據悉：中央信託局自日本運到人造絲四千餘箱後，刻正擬具配售辦法。可能按各絲織廠之實際需要量，每週配售二次。現方辦理絲織廠登記事宜，中信局將根據各廠填來之登記表，實地複查，俾便核定共合理之需要量。至外傳中信局將專配生產商，統建將專配販賣商一節，中信局及統建兩方面均未能予以證實。</p>
<p>人造絲一二〇號天橋有光，昨上午開盤四百三十萬元，比週三又大二十萬元，統建昨日配售之期，上午牌價遲遲未掛，以致又掀動一般投機者盲目抬高，最大喊到五十萬元，下午始悉統建掛牌價與上期相同，一〇〇號一二〇號有光爲二百八十萬元，半光二百五十六萬元，七五半光二百三十五萬元，於是人心漸軟化，結果喊三十五萬元，不過成交殊寥，廠經交易亦稀，脚地頗覺堅硬，上午略軟，各檔貨比週三高五萬至十餘萬元不等，綢貨堅穩，惟被面交易較多，價高十萬元，華市　上午重者做三千四百元，次者三千二百元，下午人絲造疲，喊價亦略小。</p>
<h3>債市賣戶氣盛</h3>
<p>公債昨櫃面帮斬多，縱有金融性之買戶來吸雜牌，仍告盤跌，統丙最開二二三〇元，開後即自二二五〇元起，爲賣戶所包圍，曾迫近二〇〇〇元大關，最後在二〇五〇左右盤旋，結果較封關前回小二九〇元，甲乙丁各低二二〇元，統戊則挫二四〇元，成交約五百餘萬元。</p>
<h3>平民福音　豆·米·油均告回跌</h3>
<p>米市來源湧旺，南北市場到一萬三四千石，市化呆滯之極，秈米續見猛挫二三千元，粳米中次亦下跌二三千元，惟白元貨稀，尚挺，陰元堅定，生油青島來源接通，下降千餘元，豆油菜油到消兩平，廠方供應略有，市勢平正，黃豆東北來貨尚有，漢口雜糧續到，外埠消化不動，回跌二三千元，菉豆各路湧到，中次無受主，高貨零星交易，價格高定次呆，紅糧見疲三五百元，黃　量關再低千元，惟生仁店方乘巧納取，高貨疲而復振，回升二三千元，中關加一二千元，次貨不振。</p>
<h3>貢米已抵滬　計三千七百噸</h3>

<h3>央行儘量供給　金價壓氏七萬</h3>
<p>烚赤初堅繼疲，客銷異常旺暢，央行又陷於苦戰，晨開二二四萬有買，閩汕帮吸收不已，加之散戶惑於傳說，買氣甚殷，此後即告上昇，惟在二二七萬外，頗有掙扎，高價曾見二二八萬五，十時後形勢又盤，央行一再供給，並以二二七萬之價，配給五〇條，迨後客銷納胃告滯，浮多有後顧之憂，紛紛斬多，央行更乘隙而入，遂破二二〇萬大關，跌至二一八萬，面後賣氣始定，午刻回升至二二二萬光景，午後內行急售，現貨再告下游，同時并聲稱二一五萬之價，繼續配給，跌至二一四萬，隔日交易微穩，升至二一六萬，結果較封關前回跌七萬八，飾金掛低至念三萬，紋銀三千六，銀元微回至二〇四〇元有售。</p>
<h3>計口配糖　在積極推進中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕計口配糖事宜，刻仍在積極推進中。聞台糖公司將撥出中砂台糖四百萬斤，以每市斤八百元之代價，分售予本市南貨業同業公會各會員，由各南貨號代爲配售，每市斤爲一千元（包括包紮費用在內）。現正由台糖公司印製購糖證，三五日內即可全部印　，由民政處根據全市已登記之戶口，無分老幼，每口發證一紙，憑證可購糖一市斤。據聞至遲可於本月底以前開始配售云。</p>
<p>潮青略升</p>
<p>昨糖市趨勢平穩，青糖再見略升，公會劃盤現貨中砂白爲十三萬九千元至八千元，生砂赤稍軟，初爲十二萬元，後爲十一萬八千元，號貨有汕頭帮開出提莊青十一萬七千元，升二千元，黃崗青升數元，爲十一萬三四千元，以　帮助辦所致，興化帮開中檔貢粉白十三萬元六千元，興赤十三萬一二千元，建帮開袋莊刁青十萬〇六千元，廣包莊十萬〇八千元，共計成交四五百件。</p>
<h3>商會通告　薪給所得稅暫折半扣繳</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市商會爲准財政部上海直接稅局公函，對薪給報酬所得稅，自十月份起，暫按稅率半數扣繳，特通函各業公會及商店週知照辦。該函原文略稱：茲爲邇應環境需要起見，在未奉部令指示以前，對於各納稅義務人在本年十月一日以後，凡屬於第二類乙項薪給報酬之所得，暫按照本年四月十六日公佈之修正稅率核計之稅款半數扣繳納庫，等奉部署指示到局後，再行遵照核定辦法，　實補退，以符法令，至自本年四月十六日起至九月三十日止之所得部分，仍應按照上項修正稅率計稅繳納。</p>

<h3>陳茶去化尚佳</h3>
<p>英莊對於高檔陳茶頗有需求，尤以卅四年陳祁門爲最，雖由震和茶棧相當吐售，然尚不敷分配，其他花色，則以存底未見充沛，交易不若以前活躍，至於紅緣茶內銷，本街店莊及客帮依然呆滯，然土莊製茶廠之祁門花香，脫手異常順利，行情迭創高峯。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十日電〕戰後第二批運英　茶四萬八千磅，預計將於十月底到達。其中若干數量業已照樣品估價每磅三先令四便士至五先令出售。</p>

<h3>黑市偵騎密佈　美鈔暗盤繼漲</h3>
<p>外幣甚爲穩健，美鈔晨開三五〇〇元有買，仍無成交，依然有行無市，暗盤中約四四〇〇元左右，偵騎密佈，交易開展，結果較封關前爲昂，港票初俏後疲，自九五〇元起退至九二〇元有售，結果較國慶前回小二十元，港匯亦然，最後約九一〇元至九三〇元，印匯一一二〇元至一一四〇元，英匯一五〇〇〇元左右，美匯牌價未更，依然毫無對估做。</p>
<h3>南運紗布開始申請　紡管會將派員駐閩粵汕廈</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部紡織事業管理委員會自公告紗布輪往華南暫行管理辦法及其申請審核簡則後，昨日起，該會業已開始接受各紗布廠商申請登記。昨日上午各廠商前往索取登記表者，頗爲踴躍，計運銷商有九十七家，生產商有五十八家。下午數字未有統計。據該會業務處長劉文騰語記者：該會對申請登記之廠商，及各家申請南運之檔布數量，將予嚴格審核。即統建公司，亦須登記申請，並無例外。棉紗南運數額，因已分配定奪，故性質單純，將採隨到隨審制。棉布南運問題，性質較爲複雜，將來可能集中爲半個月審核一次。審核時將以南運總額七萬五千餘疋，參照民國廿五廿六兩年布疋輪往福州，廈門，汕頭，及廣州四口岸之數量，定出輪往各口岸這百分比。如申請南運布疋數量，在此百分以內，當儘量予以核准。超過時，將予核減。至各廠商間數量之分配，將以其資本額及運銷量爲審核之標準。劉氏亟望織造廠應儘先登記，以便決定分配數量。又據云：紡管會即將派遣專員四人，分駐神州，廈門，汕頭，廣州四口岸，俾對南運之紗布，盡其督導之責。各專員將與駐在地之商會及有關之同業公會，治議南運紗布在當地之合理價格。並督使當地之生產用戶，應有儘先配售權。又南運紗布抵達目的地後，當地之收貨人，須向紡管會之專員處，填定南運紗布銷售概況表，以資核查，而杜流弊</p>
<h3>外股微跌</h3>
<p>外股昨亦隨大勢而趨疲，并無新多活動，怡紗自一〇〇〇〇元起，盤跌至九二〇〇元左右而後告穩，最後在九六〇〇元光景徘徊，結果較封關前計怡紗英聯會德豐各跌半成光景，餘才都有微挫。</p>
<h3>熱門均告低落　華股成交減少</h3>
<p>華股昨大戶按兵不動，滿腔熱望之散多又陷入悲慘命運，初高後低，銀根首鬆，開盤即昂，惟屬曇花一現，不久即由堅轉平，但散戶尚乘賤而納，於是過程曲折而下，市況平靜，十一時後萎靡不振，但十一時半有一度重振，北帮稍納，永紗曾由八〇〇元關內回出關外，有短時期之穩定，但買氣仍暫不久，又退入關內，於是大勢已去，散多恐慌，場外供源陸續，缺乏維持，近午降至低價，結果較封關前計永紗美亞景福新光勤興信各各跌十分之二三不等，冷股中絲獨漲半成弱，大通麗安微升，榮豐漲十分之六，五和水泥景綸平平，餘者均告微降，總成交額計九一九萬股，場外各股亦跌者居多。</p>
<h3>棉紗又漲十餘萬　配價未動棉布呈盤旋之象</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紗布情況堅定，廣帮去化雖微，乃長江及北路續有採購，本埠廠帮隨時亦有小額添補，價格報升，做開四二支藍鳳三百四十八萬元，廿支經磅雙馬二百廿一萬，有人收進生磅貨，做二百卅二萬元，前者計漲十餘萬元，後者亦稍有堅昂。</p>
<p>統建配紗價照舊，其配售對象，二〇支藍鳳爲染織帆布公會，卅二支藍鳳爲針織手工內衣，卅二支銀月爲染織內衣，四二支日光爲針織等，共開售八百元九十八件半。廿支紗配價仍爲一百五十五萬元，其他支數，比例核增。</p>
<p>布市昨不脫盤之勢，最初一致報堅，計龍頭細布做九萬元，五福藍鳳二牌做八萬四千元左右，三A彩球八萬七千元，四君子嗶嘰九萬五千元，迨後因成交式微，稍呈回勢。</p>
<h3>稅原料稅製品　呢帽業不平之鳴</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市商會爲據本市草呢帽業二業同業公會函陳困難四點，　請轉呈當局，將帽業貨物稅准賜豁免，當代電呈行政院及財政部，略稱：查貨物稅即係沿製從前之統稅，向例一稅之後，不再複稅。以棉紗爲例，棉紗完納貨物稅之後，由紗織成之布，以及由布製成鞋帽衣服，均無須再完貨物稅。今毛紡織廠所製之毛綫，既已完稅，對於由毛類原料所製成之呢帽，尚須重行完稅，直屬一物兩稅。按照紗稅爲比例，顯失公平。籍以皮毛類既同在貨物稅法範圍之內，似不應獨有瑣細歧異辦法，擬請鈞院部鑒核賜免除云。</p>
<h3>證交添做後市　定於十六日起</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：證券容易所已決定自本月十六日起，增添後市交易。自該日起，交易時間將略有調整。上午自九時半至十二時，下午二時至三時。當日四時對賑，次日辦理交割。各經紀人之代用品保證金三千萬元，統限於十六日前繳齊。否則將暫停其入場交易。聞證交方面，對若干已繳公債市場現金保證金二千萬元者，將暫准通融移抵。</p>
<p>又關於外股上市事，一週前曾有外商公司七八家，前往證交索取上市證券申請書。惟因翻譯需時，故迄未填就送到。至第二批化商上市股票，刻將由專設之小組會，繼續審核。第二批經紀人卅餘名，刻已審查竣事，即將呈　核示云。</p>

<h3>教部請追加復員費　政院先撥百億　不及呈請數十分之一　仍擬向四聯總處借款</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕敎部自車船飛機票價齊漲，各種物價激增，後方學校及敎育機關，全部復員之原有預算經費，不敷現實開支，相差甚鉅，迭據直屬各校等請求追加預算，已經切實審核，通盤規畫，按照中央規定，地方普通行政費，不得超過二倍至四倍之原則，從最低標準二倍計列，彙請中央追加教育復員經費一千二百億元，（原來復員費，中央核定六百億，此次請追加二倍，爲一千二百億），尙在政院審核中。後方各學校各敎育機關，初因交通方面，未能多量支配旅運船位，迫於情勢，須及早復員，及暑期招生，暑後開學種種關係，有專僱船隻，或捨舟就陸，繞道旅運者，加以各種票價激增，旅次食宿費，隨物價波動以俱高，而中途大站埠換船，待輪候車，稽延時日，均超出最初理想費用甚鉅，除旅運費加高之外，學校辦公上課，員生住宿設備等費，與修建費，亦加高多倍，勢須追加經費，以補濟現實開支。現在物價波動不已，復員旅運，與學校設備，及建築等事，行之俞遲，費用愈鉅，公敎人員之待遇，迭在調整，可爲明證，已在進行復員或急待復員之各校等，迭次向教部請撥追加經費，以免延宕，更受物價激動影響，敎部據情，亦迭向中央陳請，最近聞已經決定先撥一百億元，以應目前急需。整個請求之一千二百億，尙在審查中。敎部約下星期，向中央領到一百憶經費之後，即通盤審核各校目前急迫需費情形。（截至目前，各校因迫切需要，請在中央未核撥一千二百億以前，暫時借一部分經費，各校合計數字，已達三百億元，敎部爲各校環請借支經費事，日不暇給，難以應付，惟有儘湯下麵，甚感粥少僧多之苦），先行分配一部經費，以應各校急需。在未經中央決定暫行先撥一百億以前，敎部曾爲各校向四聯銀行總處進行借款，該處允借三十億元，因敎部據各校原來請求，是由敎部担保，學校向四行借款，四行之意，由敎部各義直接借款，俟復員追加經費撥發時歸還，因此手續尙未商定。現在中央雖先撥一百億，未及呈請數十分之一，（呈請之數爲一千二百億），借款仍感需要，惟四行借款手續較繁，兌現時間較遲。</p>

<p>高瞻遠矚生面別開</p>
<p>開明書店，自章錫琛離滬，夏巧尊謝世後，由總經理范洗人主持，保持固有聲譽，將有名作新舊書出版。正中書局，雖少人事更動，而主持者葉溯中，高瞻遠矚，對總局及分局，均能審愼處置，平均展開業務，爲同業中比較有計劃有希望者。生活書店，形成新文藝總滙，總經理徐伯昕，即在此方面時時發揮新力量。光明書局，係王之澄獨瘓經營，本以新文藝馳名，最近編印兒童讀物，別開生面。</p>

<p>本市敎育貸金委員會，申請貸金生核准名單，陸續發表後，已有四千三百八十三人，其最後一批服務生暨蒙難同志名單，亦將於今明發表完竣。聞此次服務標準，除根據該會第二號通吿之規定外，並將參加國貨市塲服務優良學生，亦包括在內，計核准全部學費者爲一百十二人，（內蒙難同志淸寒子弟五十一名），核准學費半數者爲二百九十八名。惟此次貸金總收入與理想相　殊遠，截至九月底止，約計一萬萬三千餘萬元，其中百分之三十三強，將支配給抗戰蒙難同志子弟暨服務優良學生，餘數將由全體核准生平均分配，故第一次分配每生僅能得二萬元。又震旦大學審核工作，將由該校校長及學生團體自行負責，根據敎貸會服務獎勵辦法，該校可能單獨獲一千餘萬元，其名單由該校轉交敎貸會後，將與大公報推銷生名單同時發表。</p>

<h3>征輪受挫　出師不利敗於仁餘</h3>
<p>洛陽陸軍輜汽第六團征輪籃球隊，抵滬業已數日，昨晚七時在市體育館初戰仁餘隊，觀衆尙見踴躍，情緒頗爲熱烈，惜征輪以塲地不慣，出師不利，結果以卅三比卅七受挫於仁餘，上半時仁餘以廿四比十七佔先。</p>
<p>場地不慣作戰</p>
<p>綜合全局，征輪身材體力甚佳，其戰法確曾受過指導，以內地球隊而言，已頗爲不易，惜乎聯絡方面，尙欠純熟，方法亦有可改進之處，假以時日，必有可觀，據領隊吳琢銘吿記者，謂該隊尙係初次在室內燈光下作戰，且扇形標準球板，亦從未曾使用，故投擲方面，自當减色也。</p>
<p>仁餘先佔優勢</p>
<p>裁判劉荷生吳子彬，征輪以韋凌霄，蔡忠强，屠文龍，于瑞章，王秉煥臨陣，仁餘則以王槐庭，姚文彝，沈鵬舉，吳新述，孫國政出塲。征輪下馬施威，于瑞章連獲三分，仁餘沈鵬舉罰球得點，此後仁餘一帆風順，王槐庭沈鵬舉獲分累累，九比四後，征輪工秉煥于瑞章各中一球，退至八對九，十五對十一時，仁餘梁永佳入代孫國政，征輪呼停，果見轉機，成十七對十九，僅差二分，惟仁餘又有所獲，上半時結束，仁隊以廿四對十七領先。</p>
<p>征輪二度超出</p>
<p>休息之後，軍行交兵，征輪屠文　首先命中，于瑞童繼之立功，聲勢頓盛，仁餘以陳渭源入替王芝生，惟征輪屠子又各建一功，征輪乃以廿五對廿四超出，四座觀衆，報以掌聲，仁餘姚文　罰入，成各廿五。子再施神射，征輪再抬頭，惜未能保持優勢，即被仁餘一氣呵成十分，仁餘後以卅五對廿七遙領，征輪蔡于屠三將各中一球，比數又接近，成卅三對卅五，仁餘五次呼停，沈鵬舉鵠中，時章凌寗霄五次犯規畢業，迨劉政軍上塲，征輪竟失去二次必中之球，否則尙可戰成平手，未幾終塲，結果州三對卅七。</p>

<h3>直放舊金山　「美琪将軍號」艦上十日</h3>
<p>— 九月十六日舊金山航訊　朱海濤</p>
<p>回想到兩個月來爲出國所作的奔波，問想到九年來的動亂生活，因抗戰而使我的出國延遲了八年，我感到今日的成行，幾乎像是一個悠長的夢。然而，欣幸的是，十年宿志，到底如願以償了，我這樣地安數着自己。</p>
<h3>赴美留學手續　衛過八關·突出重圍</h3>
<p>說到留學，可眞是五花八門，無奇不有。因爲有一個時期，政府規定很嚴，不經敎育部考試，便不許人們出去，而敎育部却又幾年不舉行考試。於是一班近水樓台的人，就人仙過海，竭力地各顯神通。有的跟着出國要人，常一名掛名的隨員，有的請求主席來一個特訐，有的冒充外交官的太太，有的作了關病人的侍從。有一個時期，凡受國外聘请講學的可以出去，於是一時請求者都成了國際開名的學者。有一個時期，報館可以派國外記者，於是出國者盡是新聞界的無冕帝王。直到今天，同船上許多留學者還領的是經商，傳敎，華僑……一些莫明要妙的護照。我可以告訴你：每一個上這船的學生，都曾經歷過少則數月，多則數年的奮鬥，過五關，斬六將的，殺出重圍。</p>
<p>依照目前敎育部的規定：（指民三十五年夏）只要是國立或已立案學校畢業，任職五年，而得着國外大學獎學金的，可以申請發給留學證書。或者是經過留學考試及格的，也可以發給留學證書。這是兩條正路。但國外獎學金不易得，留學考試不常舉行。於是各種的變通方法就來了。上面所說的僅只一部而已。爲着這些變通辦法，公私方面都增加許多麻煩，敎育部部次長因日日此而受苦，就連主席都不免神及此，這在行政效率上是很不合算的？不過無論如何，眞要留學的話，必須在國外大學得一入學許可書，這是第一關。此關多则一年，少则一月。</p>
<p>許可書得到後，呈請敎育部准予留學。平均約需時二月至三月，這是第二關。</p>
<p>憑敎育部准許留學（或經濟部准訐經商）公文，向外交部請領護照。某間須交照片三張，護照費五千〇五元，須要當地殷實舖保，保證出國者的經濟來源，保證出國者不危害國家利益。（機關派遺者得由派遣機關保證）並經過對保乎續，大概順常的話，送進外交部護照科後一個多禮拜，可以有結果。護照是一本藍布面很精緻的厚册子，載明姓名，年齡，職業等。普通留學有效期間爲三年，這是第三關。</p>
<p>同時，就要到中央醫院或向美領事館取得體格檢騐書，（C119　form）到美方指定的醫生那裏檢騐體格，包括X光透視等，確定絕無砂眼，結核等病。這檢査相當麻煩，常不是一天弄得完的。如果大小便都現成，則第二天就可以看到結果，這是第四關。此關也需要像片，以蹬明其爲本人。</p>
<p>利用檢査體格時間，就開始注射防疫針，計接種牛痘一次，注射霍亂及傷寒刊防針各三次，斑疹傷寒及鼠疫預防針各一次，逐項塡人海港檢疫所之「預防接種證明書」內。此書也儼然成册，號稱「黃皮書」，連同體格檢査書，送經海關檢疫所檢定，這是第五關，通常約須延長至二星期到三星期。</p>
<p>取得護照後，即憑護照向中國銀行國外部申請外匯。要塡兩張申請書，普通學生只能申请五百美元旅費和半年費用九百美元，共一千四百美元，但常可設法多請。申请書由中國銀行轉請中央銀行外匯處核准，約需四五日可望結匯。結匯除官價外，還要加根據當日市價決定的手續費，計每一美元三十至五十元法幣不等，這是第六關。</p>
<p>護照，入學許可書，體格檢査書，（由醫生塡好，彌封，專爲給美領事館的。）黃皮書，本人名下之外匯支票或匯票，（數額依外出任務而異，留學則一千四百美元可以通過），船公司的船位預定書，這些都齊備之後，可以到上海福州路建設大樓四百〇八號美國領事館去請求簽照。（Visa）這也是個大關口，每天那屋子裏門庭若市，中國人，外國人，不計其數。登記後，等到有信約定時間去見一位中國人羅先生（Mr．Peter　Loh）時，則大致有望了。羅先生是位面少笑容，忙碌非凡的人。他會査驗所有證件，問你許多問題，從出娘胎直問到現在，從現在直問到將來。你最好是從實招來，即使是小姐也不必隱瞞歲數。他會拿出一大堆表格來，將你的話用打字機一一錄入。他會叶一個用人按住你左右手，逐指印上三四十個指模和手印。其中印得最多的是右手食指，因爲牠是最可能犯罪的一個。一切塡好，要你簽上十幾個字承認負責。繳上四張照片，和十塊美金，（注意必須美金，不要法幣。好在四川路九江路一帶賣黑市的零攤很多，可以隨便買十塊，但要注意不要買了假的）再拿着這堆表格進裏屋去見一位女副領事。她會問你，這些表上塡的都是眞的嗎？如果眞的，就請舉起右手來。你將右手一舉，就算宣過誓了，她會在你的文件上簽上字，你再拿出去見羅先生，他會替你把該帶的都挑出來，呌你　回去，於是此關已過。此關過得快時極快，慢時也許永遠過不去，這是第七關。</p>
<p>最後一關，但並不一定是最簡單的一關，是船公司的買票。普通是在廣東路近外灘的大來公司。（The　Preiat　Line）由於戰時船位的攞擠，最好不管其他各關進行如何，先在幾個月前，就將船位訂好。等到你一關關打過，這一關也正好差不多捱到你了。否則單爲船票，白等兩三個月，那是犯不着的，這是第八關。</p>
<p>關於上船的一切，船公司有詳細的規定，這裏不必詳提。不過有幾點値得注意：（一）上船前，最好買一個能摺疊的帆布靠椅，因爲戰時裝備的船上不供給坐椅，有此一椅舒服得多。（二）隨身衣服要帶足，因爲走北路，氣候相當的冷。（三）僅防　手，如果護照丢掉了，便不免前功盡棄。</p>
<h3>艦上人才極一時之盛</h3>
<p>「美琪將軍號」（S．S．GeneralM．C．Meigs）二萬二千噸，長六百二十二呎，吃水三十呎，六層甲板，一九四四年三月十二日下水。該船由美國大來公司經營，原爲戰時運輸艦，新將大砲拆除，而內部構造尙未大改。客艙分兩類：一種名官艙，（Officers＇Cabin）每室容六人至二十四人不等。一種名救急艙（Emergarcy　Closs）每室容一二百人不等。官艙床爲二層或三層，室內有桌椅，有交誼室，大餐間，專用甲板等。救急艙無桌無椅，床一疊四層，每層相距尺餘，側身可以臥入，不能起坐，原爲戰時運兵者。全船所有用具，均蓋有「美國政府財產」印，間有雕或織成U．S．A．（美國海軍）字樣者。登舟之日，即貼有佈吿：船有物品均爲美政府所有，如有盜竊者，處以一萬元以下罰金或一年以下徒刑云云。官艙吃飯，分兩班入席；救急艙則排班鵠候，依次入飯堂。堂有大鍋若干，隊伍順序而前，人各取刀，叉，匙，及合金製之盤，盤分六格，過一鍋即置一菜入格內。菜每餐大同小異，大致早晨爲麥片粥或西米粥，蛋，麵包，甜品，咖啡等。午晚餐爲牛肉，洋芋，飯或麵，豆，麵包，白菜，南瓜，水果，甜點心，咖啡之類。匆匆食畢，自取盤去另一　　，將未食及食殘之品擲入垃圾桶。將盤，刀，叉，匙，杯等，交還櫃內人員。退，於是餐事吿終。喝則食堂內有六大桶，裝熱開水，但普通多就各艙之噴泉，喝凉水。</p>
<p>「救急艙」內，各床均有厚墊褥，白被單，枕套，及大毛巾均極乾凈。每週換一次或兩次。艙旁爲盥洗室，兼淋浴室，室內有鹽水及未瀘淸之淡水，供洗滌。自用衣服，亦必須自己洗滌。隔室爲大小便所，無限制供給便紙。</p>
<p>船上免費供應洋火，信紙，信封。另外有零售處，賣巧克力，餅干，花生米，烟，粉撲……等等。全船除客艙因客人太多，較髒較亂外，均保持整潔。在船上，我只發現過一隻蒼蠅，沒見過吳虫，蚊子，跳蚤或白蝨。據說有人發現過老鼠，但未能證實。全船各處置有大鐵桶，廢紙，果皮，均置入，按時擲入海中。</p>
<p>據說自從七月四號開過一隻客船以後，「美琪將軍號」是第一隻開赴美國的，而這船開後，直到十月十二日才再有船。（按即Marine　Lynx，這船昨天我還看見停在舊金山被美國海員罷工凍住了。如此則十月十二日恐朱必有船）。於是所有趕開學的留學生，都盡可能的趕上這隻船來。加上政府所派考察火員，美國所邀知名敎授，於是這船中人物，極一時之盛。因此有人說有史以來沒有同一隻船載了這麽多中國人到舊金山的，這也許是過分誇張的話。</p>
<p>戴愛蓮表演舞蹈　渾身都顯示節奏船在民國三十五年九月三日下午四時離上海公和祥碼頭。雖然戰時艱難，看不見彩色繽紛的紙條來連繋船中和岸上，但岸上成千的人冒着大太陽，揮舞着手帕，扇子和草帽，其熱情是非常可感的。尤其因爲船上有大批流亡的猶太人，碼頭上有幾百位猶太同胞排着隊，唱着歌，隨着船向前走，直走到碼頭盡處，猶是不斷的揮巾擲帽，直到人形　小，歌聲漸遙，船上的人眼圈兒也紅了不少，有幾位小姐竟忍不住失聲啼哭，這使我這出慣門的人不免暗笑，但也不能不寄予同情。</p>
<p>船行二日，過日本島後，漸行漸北，風浪漸多，天氣漸冷，甲板上的人也越來越少了。到得中秋節的下午，竟少得只剩下幾個人，這形勢在近舊金山的幾天中，因爲航程轉南，天氣較好，又轉熱鬧了，熱鬧到至於土風舞也跳成了。戴愛運表現了渾身都有節奏的舞蹈。</p>
<p>原來，這船是由上海直放舊金山的，中途連小島也不靠，接連十多天均不着陸，人們是足够無聊的。我，慚愧，除了在床上躺着整天整夜的睡以外，起來時就常在甲板上看海。</p>
<p>馮將軍雄風如昔　講談！「利他主義」</p>
<p>有許多人買了「美琪將軍號」的照片，請別人簽字，大概也是在珍重這次船上的人才濟濟吧。常然，提起人物來，我們不能不說到新近退役，被派出洋考察水利，準備爲中國修治黃河的馮玉祥將軍。馮將軍高大的身材，洪亮的聲音，是大家熟悉的。現在六十多歲的年紀，已少不了蒼蒼白髪，有時他也有點暈船。偶然，看見他用大衣厚裏住自己躺在甲板椅上，夫人陪坐在旁邊，似乎有點衰老了。但另一時又可以看見雄糾糾的在甲板冷風中健步，雄風如昔。在華友聯誼會成立會上，他曾大聲的說：「許多期友問我，到了外國，人家問起我們國內的事來，我們怎樣回答呢？我說：中國最大的事情，是抵抗日本，現在那樣大面難的問題都解決了，其他的事有什麼不可以解決的呢？抗戰，是全國老百姓的功勞，但是蔣委員長和國幾黨的領導之功，也是鐵的事實。跎無頭而不行，蔣委員長和國民黨的貢獻，是不容抹煞的。自然，對於現狀是不能滿意的。許多人說：怎麽這樣貪汚呀？可是，一個政府上上下下這麼多人，怎麽能說個個好呢？蔣委員長派人去接收，並沒有說：你們看着好的就拖帶了去呀！我們天天看報，究竟用後腦杓吃黑棗（槍斃）的官　是有的。中國的地方這麽大，人口這麽多，一時裏弄不十分好，也是因爲問題太多了呀！……」</p>
<p>馮將軍吿訴我：他考察的期間，將有一年多，不但看美國，還要看歐洲。他現在正在爲大公報及和平日報寫考察日記，說來和記者還是同業哩。</p>
<p>關於整理水利的意見，隨從他出去的水利專家章元羲先生主張，他回來後，不要作十年二十年的大工程，（像Y·V·A·那樣）可以先作一個二三年能完成的小型水利工程，以小量動力推助小量工業，以小量工業來培養較大水利工程、再來惟動較大量的工業，循序漸進，可以切實有效，否則好大喜功，反致毫無成就，我想，致力實踐的馮將軍，是會同意這意見的。至少，馮夫人是已經同意了。</p>
<p>鬍子飄蕭老教授出國講學覓資料</p>
<p>另一位馮先生，是當代大哲學家馮友闌敎授。樸素的衣裝，夾在學生羣中，睡「夾解麵包床」，吃「排班站隊飯」，除了一簇飄飄然的鬍子以外，沒有一點和我們兩樣。他吿訴我是應賓夕凡尼亞大學之聘去講學的，期間一年。他希望能在美國找到點中國所沒有的中國哲學資料。</p>
<p>華羅庚先生不幸是一位跛子，但他在數學上的成就，早已使他名滿天下。這回是美國方面慕名來聘，於是他不辭勞瘁地繼蘇聯之行，和我們同船赴美了。馮友蘭先生祝福他能在美國醫好他的腿。據說道是可能的，我們也同樣祝福他。</p>
<p>黎東方先生自謙爲說書的，他說：他的目的是要實現歷史通俗化的任務。他常和外國人聊天，向外國人解釋中國的弱點。他認爲目前國民黨是在替不實行國民黨決議的政府受過，因此主張趕快召開國民大會，還政於民。提到中國史學界的派系紛歧，他很高興的談中國史學會的成就，他主張化除派系，通力合作。</p>
<p>朱懋澄先生是一位很擅長詞令的四川人。中英文都好。他現在盡全力於「世界公民運動」的推進，想化除第三次世界大戰的發生，道次旅行，是他環球行程的第八次了。</p>
<p>其他的知名之士太多了，不及一一介紹，而其中不知名之下一輩，也正有着不可限量的前途。</p>

<h3>汴鄭行　二日開封航訊</h3>
<p>隴海路上，你如果想作一個乘客的話，你可眞要有好的耐性才行。先說你想知道有軍沒車，就不是件容易事。隴海路上的火車，是「三天一打魚，五天一晒網」。在報上天天有隴海路的消息，不是沒煤就是發生故障了，想坐車就得首先打聽消息。聽到個眞實消息可眞是不容易，辦事處，問事處以及站上的人臉子可不好看，聲音可也難聽，很不耐煩呢。即使有車了，你能買上票，坐上車，那更是不容易，我也就很佩服你的本領與運氣了。但，說來說去，你有錢總是好些的。</p>
<p>隴海路在天天嚷着煤，彷彿這樣就可以把一切責任都推拖得過。可是，鐵路要「車通」，是個最起碼的條件。隴海路自全部接收以來，成績是什麽？快車，慢車，混合車，總就是那一趟車，有軍通，就算不錯了。一位愛鐵路以至要犧牲掉生命的人，他對我說過，八號橋在炸的時候，他哭了！他說，八號橋不會再修得像過去那樣好了，而且在現狀之下，這座橋是不會修起的！而且，即使木橋修好，很快的就要壞的，到雨季，隴海路要七零八落的，越來越糟，以至不「通」的！這些話全都應騐了。</p>

<p>隴海路上，很多乘客都已爲它獻出了生命，這也是必然的。這次交口地方，四五百旅客把生命又獻作禮品了。這裏面犧牲了的，誰能說沒有天才，沒有國家必需的幹部？一位師長全家都死了，他該爲國家死的，可是竟爲隴海路死了！交口慘事，祗使虎威的路警發了財，交口東西地方的棺材舖也發了財。四五百條性命現在已經埋在地裏了，路局上的負責人在報上說，向中央請求處分，這個賬說是最低能的小孩子也會算。一條命怎樣抵得上四五百條命？讓我們平心靜氣地來看這慘事的結果吧！政府已以最大的決心，來整飭紀綱，爲人民興利除害，我想總不會放輕這事件過去的。不會讓死者含寃在交口的地下的！</p>
<p>從開封到鄭州，只有一百四十里的路程，你知道，隴海路的列車，竟要走多少鐘頭，十二個小時！車走得很不快，是「爬」着走的，你丢在車下東西的話，跳下去取，可以不慌忙地再爬上來。軍子都是沒頂的鐵皮車同悶子車，查票的人，都是從車上跳下，又跑上另外的車子的，就是這樣安然地進行工作的。</p>
<p>隴海路已經到了非整頓不可的地步了！這列車是同牛車一樣的爬的，「車」是破車，而「牛」是「老牛」。這正是隴海路的最確常的寫照。「破車」怎能會好？「老牛」又怎能拉得快？</p>

<h3>民族藝術與民族精神</h3>
<p>— 許士騏</p>
<p>世界各國文化的起源，可以分成兩大系統，在東方導源於中國印度，影響及於朝鮮日本，普及亞洲大陸。西方文化，淵源於埃及希臘，洗入意大利半島，影響全歐及美國；因時間空間和自然環境的不同，所形成各民族藝術，自有特殊的精神和貢獻。</p>
<p>一片美麗的秋海棠葉，亙古浮沉在黃海及東南海之演，葉柄的中極，構成山東半島，葉脈分成黃河，揚子江，珠江三大流域，阿爾泰山，天山；和喜馬拉雅山，做他西南和北部的天然邊緣；和屏藩。氣候兼有溫熱寒帶的綜錯，人文氣質，有沉毅剛強，懇摯和平的風度。可惜這一片美麗的秋海棠葉。一世紀以來，被我們的芳隣扶桑小姐看中了，她認爲是一片肥美的桑葉，結識侵略伙伴，實行蠶食，吐了一大堆「以德報怨」的亂絲。她同時忘卻了，這葉的主人，曾給予她以莫大的文化恩澤；和瑰奇偉麗的藝術貢獻，時代之輸，不斷地前進；到了現在，秋海棠葉，畢竟不是桑葉，可是作蘭自縛的芳隣，反變成可憐蟲了！</p>
<p>中華民族固有的藝術，具有他超然獨立的精神，商周的鼎彝銅器，兩漢的宮室文物石刻，唐五代的壁畫彫刻，詩歌，音樂，舞蹈，宋人的寫生花鳥，以及山水人物，精工瑰麗，尚有唯一超越實現的抽象藝術，爲世界各國所無，而爲中土特有的民族藝術的書法，書體能代表時代的轉變，和作家思想人格的洗露，實爲東方藝苑的環寳。</p>
<p>東方蔚藍的蒼穹，襯託出喜馬拉雅山雪峯的巍峨，令人對這亞細亞南端的印度半島，具有四千年文化史的古國，發生無限的感想。遠在周靈王時，北印度迦毘羅城，誕生了佛敎的始祖釋迦牟尼。他以超人的智慧和思想，悲天憫人的胸懷，創爲敎義，影饗整個東方民族博大和平崇高的哲學思想。因此在藝術上產生了莊嚴偉麗的建築彫刻和繪畫，寺院的崇宏，具有近代立體式建築的結構，壁畫構圖色彩，單純樸質，含有原始藝術的意味，幷具有現代嶄新的形式。當中國漢魏六朝時期，印度藝術輸入的奇葩異卉，開徧了一片秋海棠葉的東南西北；而大同雲岡，洛陽龍門，甘肅燉煌，留有亙古不朽佛敎藝術的偉大奇觀。</p>
<p>在人類歷史上，遺留迄今最古的建築物，是什麼？怕要算埃及金字塔Pyramid罷，這一個紀元前四千年的文明古國，東濱紅海，西臨地中海，自一八六九年，開浚蘇　士運河後，打破中古時代的好望角航綫，成爲歐亞交通的咽喉，東爲尼羅河流域，西爲利比亞沙漠，地當熱帶，百物滋繁，天然現象，深印一般人的心目中，因有多神宗敎的信仰，和自然人生永久存在之思想，在藝術上表現，都是拿來裝飾墳墓和神殿。埃及人視住宅爲逆旅；而以墳墓爲靈魂永久的安息所，偉大的建築，除金字塔外，尙有獅身人面像Sphinx，其意義，無從推測，或認爲係太陽神像，因爲太陽和宇審是永生的。</p>
<p>歐洲古代文化絢燦之花，繁榮於尼羅河畔的埃及；和崛起美索不達米亞Mesopotamia的巴比侖，賦有藝術天才的希臘民族，繼承其遺產而發揚光大，在藝術史上，建立了傾向自然主義，發揮寫實的精神，此點與埃及象徵宗敎，誇耀帝威，承承相因的作風，逈然不同。希腦地居半島，與埃及隔海相望，銅器時代，已有文化，其民族崇尙自然，愛好運動，對人體美觀念，極感興趣。奧林比亞Olymia賽會，是希臘人首先提倡的運動大會。他們拿欣賞人體美的情緒，向藝術的途徑上去創造，使希臘文化達到登峯造極的領域。遺留迄今的彫像傑作，如「持槍者」Doryphorous，「擲鐵餅者」Discobolus，打破埃及板滯正面式的作風，完全發揮自由的姿態，而爲整個歐洲大陸藝壇的先驅。</p>
<p>中國藝人崇拜自然，謳歌自然，描寫自然；而能深入自然的核心，發抒自然的崇宏瑰麗，羣巒疊翠，筆底烟雲，所以畫人以描摹山水爲唯一對象，旁及虫魚鳥獸，「採菊東籬下，悠然見南山」詩人澹泊的襟懷，所以陶淵明獨愛這「菊殘猶有傲霜枝」。林和靖爲什麼愛梅，因爲牠能在氷霜凜冽的隆冬，含芳吐　，領導春光。周敦頤爲什麼愛蓮，因爲牠出汚泥而不染，窺見君子之德，我個人畫室裏，常愛掛着一副伺子貞寫的小聯：「臨洗水猶聽古樂，遇崇山若仰大賢」。我每日俯仰其間，得到無限的人生暗示，精神安慰。</p>
<p>印度人是宗敎的崇拜者，篤愛萬物，以慈悲戒殺，摒絕俗欲，進入大同極樂世界，爲人生最高理想。他在藝術上的表現，是一塵不染靜穆莊嚴。我想到朱晦庵的一首詩：「半畝方塘一鑑開，天光雲影共徘徊；問渠那得淸如許，爲有源頭活水來」。所謂源頭活水，就是印度哲人的心境，不然何以能產生近代大詩人如泰戈爾，哲人如甘地，與尼采的哲學思想，成了一個强烈對比。</p>
<h3>孩（雕刻）</h3>
<p>— 張充仁</p>
<h3>十四行</h3>
<p>— 袁危</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>我風馳電掣地駕着駿馬，</p>
<p>從一個未知的世界奔來，</p>
<p>指向另一個未知的世界；</p>
<p>我聲嘶力竭地呌着：停吧！</p>
<p>停吧！我見流星掠過天空，</p>
<p>它霎那光華底前後兩極，</p>
<p>便是無際的黑暗。我又見</p>
<p>帝豪傑都緘默於墳塋。</p>
<p>停吧！誰疏忽了手中繮繩，</p>
<p>讓牠們跑得道樣地狂野？</p>
<p>眼看着將衝下萬仭峭壁，</p>
<p>難道酣睡情還沒有驚醒？</p>
<p>聲嘶力竭都淹沒於長風；</p>
<p>我依然祗聽到蹄聲隆隆。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>問花朵爲什麼開了又謝？</p>
<p>問春天爲什麼來了又去？</p>
<p>問豪飲爲什麼醉了又醒？</p>
<p>問着：這些問不完的問句。</p>
<p>可是儘多儘少，我不知道</p>
<p>去問誰；誰有回答的智慧？</p>
<p>或是那一本高深的書籍：</p>
<p>有着個圓滿的答案記載？</p>
<p>現在我才明白：答案正多；</p>
<p>祗是從前我傻得太厲害，</p>
<p>把永不可知的强求理解，</p>
<p>把永不可能的冒失胡爲。</p>
<p>於是把時間無效地浪費，</p>
<p>貧離了生命交替底至理。</p>
<h3>尼采是醫生</h3>
<p>— 華林</p>
<p>尼采與託爾斯泰相比，一者出身貧寒，受社會的冷酷譏刺，發現人生寡情刻薄，而以慈悲憐憫自己。託爾斯泰處境正相反，出身貴族，蒙放不覊，發現自己行爲不檢，而以殘忍毒辣處罰自已，以慈悲的同情，哀憐別人！</p>
<p>尼采與居友相比亦可類推，我們服侍家人臥病，充分表現憐憫的同情，而得親族體貼的安慰。但是治療疾病的醫生，嚴爾冷靜的面孔，施行手術，毫不顧慮到別人痛苦，他要病人强健，治愈疾病，不談什麼感情！</p>
<p>居友思想是基於正常的社會生活，尼采是在治療病痛的人生，他說在最大的痛苦之前，能過到最高的新希望！</p>
<p>人生如同山巔古松，枝幹向高處發展，向日光伸長；但是根要深入土壞裏石隙裏，甚至深入陰階的深淵。智慧的哲人，游戲他的孤寂，玩索他的痛苦，離開他的羣衆，拋棄他的道德：先是負重旅行沙漠中的駱駝，以後變成荒野民獅子，到後來終於變成天真易忘的小孩，時時開創他的新生命，周而復始，所調「不朽的輪廻』！</p>
<p>這笑容的加冕，是玫瑰的花冠，這種歡笑也是神聖的偉大的人物，應常學笑！你笑呀！你舞呀！你用笑舞的雙翼，飛越過自己的天地！尼采由悲觀哲學，走到快樂的路上，要肯定一切，積極地向前奮鬥！</p>
<p>在這殘酷無情的社會裏，呌苦是沒有用的，得不到人的同情；尼采生前與死後一樣，受社會冷酷的譏刺。所以我覺得尼采，託爾斯泰與居友，這三位創造家，對於人生的貢獻，都非常偉大，尼不過采是治療疾病的醫生，而不是安慰病人的親屬！我們治學的人們，應當分別觀察，而兼取其長！</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　　60</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>同行同志，上前說明了我們的身份，由哨崗派人打電話到城內臨時行動司令部，得了允許，方才讓我們通過。可是公路疊斷，車子無法穿得過公，我們只好把車子停在封鎖外面，託付給哨崗，步行而前。</p>
<p>這裏一路黑暗，連路燈都已熄去，也許因爲防衛意外突擊的緣故。好在只有一條大路，雖是步步探索，並不困難。走了不到一百餘米模樣，陸然看見前面，一道黃光，迎面在射過來，却是一部汽車，正朝我們這裏馳來。訓剛避在道旁，不料車子蚩的一聲，在我們身旁停下。這却得感激W君辦事週到，原來我們動身之後，W君早有消息遞到。這事是收到剛才哨崗上電話，飛馳趕來迎接的。</p>
<p>（我如今記到這裘，心下老是疑心有人在說我這些記載，必是一部小說；因爲其中確有許多「無巧不成書」的事跡。這個，我也懶得申辯；只拿我們一日廿四小時的事來說，不也是有許多「巧合」在內嗎？譬如您剛打扮整齊，預備去看朋友，那朋友偏偏會在這時，光降府上，這，假若記在書上，豈非又要疑心到筆者搗鬼，弄成「無巧不成畫」了嗎？）</p>
<p>我們未到行動臨時總部之前，昏昏的路燈下面，只看到一件事，呌我心口有些悲感交集的，乃是沿道兩旁店舖，都懸上了一面靑天白日的國旗，雖然有些舊了，幾年的摺紋，壓得那麼深，有的收藏得不妥當，顏色不像樣子，然而却是一面國旗！</p>
<p>臨時行動部長，是一位精明强幹的壯年。一見面就遞給我一張剛到不久，W君轉來的電訊：</p>
<p>「平，〇四收轉，支總，岳，柳箱結構複雜棘手，需要旭光牌甚夥，如能照前議價送來，極歡迎，可保旺銷。支行須先移晋開張，甚念羣，虎，二夥；須盡力探訪，他日定是一等助手。遼鶴，京叩。」</p>
<p>「柳箱」是穩喩「七封秘緘」收藏所在，「旭光牌」是鶴見給我的綽號，平日他同我開玩笑，總稱我是旭光牌烟捲，意思說我能補助他的思想，或提撥他一時忘記的工作。「支行」就是長辛店的秘密電台。「羣虎二夥」很明顯指着耀　和小老虎，我同W君都把二人失踪的事，傳達給他，因這二人工作和行踪，他極其繫心之故。「京」是東京。密電上本也用不着再加許多隱語，但我與他之間，這些隊語，也不過平常言詞，並不隱秘。</p>
<p>電文詳解起來，是說「七封秘緘」探索棘手，想我前去帮忙。二十九軍司令部南移，大約松井將到山西工作，所以叫我命〇四號跟踪前去。其餘乃是關心耀羣和小老虎，必須盡力將二人尋到。</p>
<p>我正凝念專心注意電文，猛不防聽得有人從旁喊道：</p>

<h3>共信</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>近來晋京請願的事頗多，不管請願者是什麼團體，是怎樣的一種性質，我們都希望此舉越少越好。</p>
<p>京滬兩地近在咫尺，電報電話，不用一小時就可以傳達，爲什麼如此不辭勞瘁僕僕風塵呢？有人說，正因爲這近在咫尺，飛機兩三小時，京滬綫臥車上一覺便睡到下關，所以不妨走走，倘使像從前一樣，國都遠在北京城，關山險阻，三月半載的跋涉，也就不會有現在這樣的樂此不疲的踴躍了。</p>
<p>倘使這一說法能成立，則請願者的決意就大可懷疑了。</p>
<p>其實，這還是一個互信的問題。</p>
<p>流行目前社會的是「凡事面陳」，這說明了對文書的信賴打了折扣，大家都對文書不當作一回事，其結果自然煩勞人與人的親自接觸了；然而在現社會關係繁復下，未免近於浪費。</p>
<p>如何建立共信，得從每個人的一言一行負責起，明知無效果的敷衍文書，或不妨試試的什麼建議計劃，最好少寫，這樣，文書的價值就不致被等閒視之了。</p>
<p>國外瑣聞</p>
<h3>糟糕的華盛頓</h3>
<p>— 郁强譯自「雜誌文摘」，錫尼·卡爾茲原著</p>
<p>不民主</p>
<p>華盛頓是美國的首都所在地，從地方行政區域而言，它超越四十八州而特劃爲「哥倫比亞區」，而它的居民也是「超越性」的：沒有選舉權，沒有自治權，也沒有向聯邦法庭控訴或被訴的權力！這誠是民主世界的一大「怪事」。某華盛頓居民憤恨的說：「這是自相矛盾的事，在這個民主的國家內却有近乎一百萬的公民被拒享有自由社會的最基本的權利」。</p>
<p>亂得很</p>
<p>執掌哥倫比亞區市政的是三名總統委任的委員。其下分設六十個左右的部，局，處，委員會之類的機構，但是這些機構有的是「疊牀架屋」，有的是職責不淸。但是市民對這些秘政，無權過部。</p>
<p>眞正管治華府市政的是分設在參衆兩議院的兩個「哥倫比亞區委員會」。華府市民說得好：「但是所有的參議員和衆議員都是別州的公民的代表啊！」委員會的辦事精神，正所謂：「每個人的事情就是沒有人的事情」，職員們爲了自己的選民已經够忙了，那有餘力去兼顧哥倫比亞區。因此，要找幾名有才幹的議員去任哥倫比亞區委員會的委員時常發生困難。就以現任的主席委員比爾波參議員爲例吧，他就是在米蘇里故鄉向選民們應允不給華盛頓市民選舉權的那個比爾波。</p>
<p>衆議院和參議院頒佈國家立法，但他們被請求頒佈一個城市的市政會識的法案時，其結果却令人傷心。幾乎每一件建議都在議院議程中遺失了。當學校，醫院或監獄的經費有緊急需要時，其結果常是悲劇性的。</p>
<p>不公平</p>
<p>更有進者，地方政府與聯邦政府間的財政分配也決定得不公平。一個著名的華盛頓律師說：雖然政府佔有市區百分之二十的土地，我們却被迫付出百分之九十的市政開支。加以，我們更每年供給政府十萬元免費的自來水，還有一部份的警防，消防和其他服務。</p>
<p>由於經費缺乏和沒有市民自治的政府，華盛頓的市政簡直糟不堪言，舉幾個例來說罷！</p>
<p>加林格醫院每年有一百四十六名嬰兒死亡，佔竇生率的千分之六十六。這個比率比美國最大的市立醫院大三倍。從下午三時到下午十一時僅有一個受過訓練的護士，由幾個未受訓練的女僕協助，照顧一百個新生的嬰兒。以後八小時中，沒有受過訓練的護士值班，而無助的嬰兒却飢餓的候着奶瓶放到他們的嘴上。</p>
<p>敎育情形如何呢？華萊士夫人曾特撰一文，刊載報端，刻劃出千萬華盛頓母親的恐懼：作爲一個學齡兒童的母親，我駭懼想到假如現在的情况被允許繼續下去，我的孩子的敎育將領導他到何種地步」？</p>
<p>現在的情况如何呢？且看助理督學威金遜的報吿：「一百級以上的初級班和兩所初級中學正在减少敎學鐘點」——校屋和敎師缺乏的結果。七千名學生每天祇上三小時半的課。家庭與學校協會的倫克爾夫人警吿說：「我們的社會將要爲部分時間的敎育付出沉重的代價。假如我們的孩子不在學校裏，他們可能使自已墮入歧途」。</p>
<p>另一個華府市民與政府間的爭端是首都警察的調用。華盛頓現有警察一千六百八十五名，但是據貿易局的觀察，至少需要二千五百名。假如，警察局長柯拉漢能够完全調用這一千多名警察於保護市民方面，倒還可差强應付；但是實際完全不是這會事。當一位貴賓晋京住在布雷爾旅館時，就得派一隊警察去佈崗守衛。或者有一位要人與總統有約，那麼摩托車巡隊又要出動護送。</p>
<h3>上海一大問題　失業者：二十五萬餘人　無業者：百卅五萬餘人</h3>
<p>— 錦霞</p>
<p>本市「職業普查」結果，業經統計完竣，並在上月中旬發表如下的數字：本市人口共三百九十六萬，有職業者一五四萬九千餘人，失業者二十五萬餘人，無業者一百三十五萬三千餘人。形成了一個嚴重的社會問題。（按無業者係指向來無業之游民。）</p>
<p>失業的現象，原是各國所免不了的，尤其是都市，爲了人浮於事，競爭的結果，優勝劣敗，產生了一羣失業者。根據一九一五年的調查，美國主要都市的勞動者，共有四十餘萬人，其中失業的，佔百分之十五。又據紐約市的調查，一九三〇年，紐約全市人口爲七百餘萬，而失業的市民，總數約四十四萬四千餘人。一九〇〇年，美國調查統計局調查所得，美國境內共有失業者六百四十七萬人。</p>
<p>美國是工業最稱發達的富裕國家，失業者尙且這樣多，其他各國失業者，人數之多，可以想見。</p>
<p>過去，本市曾有一所「上海職業指導所」的設立，該所根據民國二十四年至二十六年間的登記數字，說明每日前往該所塡寫「求職登記」的市民，平均五十餘人，最多時，每日竟有九十餘人，而塡寫「求人登記」的，每日最多不過三四人，成爲十與一的懸殊比數。求職的人，多半是普通人材，而求人的，多數需要專門人材，所以實際求得職業的人，更屬寥寥無幾。在這些求業者中間包括了十五歲以下的童子和五十歲以上的老人，衣食逼人，可發一嘆。</p>
<p>以下是每年上海失業人數的統計，就作爲本文的結束：二十四年—五十萬人；二十五年—五十二萬人，二十六年—七十萬人，二十八年約六十萬人（僅就兩「租界」所統計。）</p>
<h3>已恢復戰前景象的戰敗國之都—東京</h3>
<h3>再會霓虹燈</h3>
<p>— 正</p>
<p>推開了窗，望着外邊夜的天空似乎顯得特殊地寂寞，像缺少了一件什麼似的。仔細一想，原來習見的永安公司屋頂霓虹燈廣吿已沒有了，高聳的屋頂消失在黑暗裏。</p>
<p>翻開報紙來：「本市公用局，爲解決目前電力荒起見，凡各商店的戶外霓虹燈，一律禁止使用。」還是本月一日開始禁用的呢！但前幾天晚上霓虹燈依然炫耀如畫，商人們還不肯摒絕不用；現在，却已霓虹燈光盡熄，上海之夜，似乎是黯然失色了。</p>
<p>對於霓虹燈，在我執拗的心目中，始終認它是「罪惡的光浪」，象徵着上海世紀末的風氣。每晚從樓窗邊俯視，那些紅紅綠綠的「光之海」，老使我心中起着不舒服之感，如今燈光盡熄，雖然不無寂寞之感，但心中確然是淸靜多了。</p>
<p>這些都是空話。說得現實些吧！霓虹燈的取締予一般商人不用說是不小的打擊，入夜的營業是很有些影響的。首當其衝的是二十餘家霓虹燈廣吿公司，從此生路毫無，大發牢騷，在所不免，但是禁用霓虹燈，原是個暫時的辦法，一俟電力稍爲充裕的時候，當立可恢復原狀。公用局正協助華商及浦東電氣公司，採購小型發電機，並責令閘北水電公司趕修發電機應用，可見當局也煞費苦心。</p>
<p>我以爲夜上海的繁榮，倒不一定全靠令人眼花撩亂紅紅綠綠，太太臉上的胭脂，並非眞正血色！</p>
<h3>雙重性</h3>
<p>— 羊仁</p>
<p>讀了日前本刋「單位名稱」一文後，使我聯想到我國現在社會上，有許多「雙重性」的事情，使人對之，缺乏統一的觀念，紛亂錯雜，莫衷一是，無怪國家也不能統一了！茲舉例言之：</p>
<p>先說日曆吧，政府雖早已規定採用陽曆，但社會上實際情形，還是以陰曆爲依據，不過多了幾個名稱，形式，和假期：過了陽曆年再過陰曆年；放了年假再放寒假；年關結算再來一次總結束，諸如此類，不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>結婚的方式，有文明，有老式；文明的多自由，今天結婚，明天離婚，不足爲奇，老式的多頑固，買賣成交，隨鷄隨犬。</p>
<p>有國粹的中醫，也有洋化的西醫，你說我不好，我說你不好；只苦了一班病人們，究竟去請敎那一種好？</p>
<p>篇幅關係，不再多舉，總之，這種不一致的現象，使人感覺滑稽，也感覺迷惘！而在這「物各有雙」的社會上，「雙重人格」的人，當然是最普遍，也最適合環境了！</p>
<h3>廣告雜鈔</h3>
<p>— 岡悟</p>
<p>雙斧煙廣告頗微妙：「本國技師監製，美國煙葉製造，經濟部「接管」，「中華」……出品，「始」終滿意，「歷久」風行」。</p>
<p>福民砂眼藥水的標語：『美國最新原料，中國「第一」「創」製』。不知外國的軍火廠能不能「西」施效顰，於鎢製的出品上大書「中國原料，美國創製」。</p>
<p>皇后戲院出演阮玲玉：「新由美國運到玻璃棺材」，的確是「先睹爲快」，無需「謹請」。</p>
<p>大舞台：『門售「如潮」，定座「造反」』。並且：鄭重介紹白玉豔，如有認出非本人者，願酬五百萬元」。想不到爲了「五百萬」，竟至「造反』！</p>
<p>『造福兒孫，「最好」機會』！有心人急忙往下看來：「道德書局存貨佛經，道經，各種善書百餘種，各種法品，法器…」越看越糊塗，只記得開頭「道德」二字，確是重要。</p>
<h3>週末茶話</h3>
<p>— 墨萸</p>
<p>新人生觀</p>
<p>成都市井間最近有一趣事：某家女僕於厠所內生了一個私生子，該夜正值雷鳴電閃，大雨滂沱，次晨街鄰聞訊，以此子爲雷公趕出，命主大貴竟爭先以法幣十萬元購去，致後至者咸抱失此良機之憾。私生子而有人踴躍搶購，實在是雷電帮了這小生命的忙，後至者頓足長嘆。是因爲眼睜睜的被人把一個「命主大貴」的搖錢樹拿走了；其用心同樣都不是爲了要培育這個孩子，而是想不勞而獲的弄個「太上皇」做做。享點晚年淸福；若此子將來吃喝嫖賭，一無「貴」徵，則他的命運恐怕和當初風在雨驟下還有那麼一綫微弱生機的情景完全不同了。舉世滔滔，莫不爲自己打算，難怪縱有幾個世紀裏曾出現過像墨子，羅斯福之流的人物，但無裨於大家咬牙切齒，摩拳擦掌的心理之消戢正復相同，「利之所在，如水之就下」。其斯之謂乎？</p>

<p>前幾時，沿外灘各碼頭倉存貨物，常吿不翼而飛，有的貨船拋錨江中尙未起卸；而這裏面裝來的新鮮貨物却早已在市面上應價　售了。這情形香港也很「流行」過一陣，據說最奇怪的是被竊過的木箱之類竟找不出絲毫開　的痕跡。這當然是一些「高等華人」們與「洋　內行」合作的傑作，在香港就尊稱他們爲「爆倉老鼠」。這種老鼠一多，聯帶的「走私狐狸」就產生了；老鼠吱吱喳喳的從倉船裏摸出了東西，狐狸就鬼鬼崇祟的東搬西運。結果呢？自然生意興隆，財源茂盛，老鼠和狐狸都暗地裏一變那副伸長着尾巴的「鼓上虱」的嘴臉。西裝筆挺，雪茄在手，以　來之財，　歌逐酒，周旋於外國商賈之間，猶是高等華人本色。你以爲那許多白畫裏在你面前頤指氣使的紳士們是崇高的嗎？你曾留意過他們背着人的行徑沒有？你曾否摸過他們背後拖着的那條尾巴沒有？國際飯店頂上「禮義廉恥」的覓虹這幾天晚上不是都已經黯然無光了嗎？</p>
<p>啼笑皆非</p>
<p>據說重慶街頭近日曾出現怪道人多名，自稱來自峨嵋山，因第三次世界大戰就要爆發，特來搭救衆生；符籙每張五百元，其作用可避原子彈，買符的人頗不少，連値勤的警士也聽得津津有味，鼓勵路人購買。難得他們竟「惺惺相惜」起來，這道人修煉的道行一定已到相當火候；可惜他沒有專程趕到上海來，否則那些在新城隍廟門口看「賣解」的「刀槍不入」。以及在大舞台看「飛劍取頭」的市民們又將有了新的慰藉；原子彈快炸吧！在地球百孔千瘡的時候，我們可以符籙在身，百無禁忌了！</p>
<p>「新陳代謝」</p>
<p>據傳台灣省長官公署人事室公佈，九月份十二日起至十八日止，僅僅一個星期，任用人員四九三人，而免職者亦達二一三人。台灣重回祖國已有一年，但因爲過去受過敵人太深的毒化，所以這種對從政人員大刀闊斧的促進新陳代謝的作風，我們自無可非議；不過在一些朋友們的零鴻散簡中，聽說一般台胞到現在還稱外省去台的人呌「中國人」，稱中山裝與旗袍呌「中國衣裳」，稱靑天白日旗呌「中國旗」；大明報上也常有：「日人統治時代，本省水菓之能圓滑輸出者，不論船車，皆有時爲裝載之用意？……欲得靑果類，順利輸至本國，非業者自身，購備自有船隻，暫時想不可期。」（原文）等類總像帶有一點什麼味兒的句子；不知道這次在那些大批任免人員中，曾否抽幾個人去把這種蔓衍支離的事情先稍爲校正得像樣一點？</p>

<h3>The National Assembly to be Held as Scheduled: Government Order for Representatives to Attend and Register; Minister Peng Hopes Various Parties Will Submit Lists</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] The convening order for the National Assembly was officially issued by the Government's Civil Affairs Office on the 11th, and simultaneously delivered to all representatives, instructing them to convene as scheduled and register before November 2nd. This reporter visited Chief Civil Affairs Officer Wu Dingchang and Minister Zhang Lisheng in the evening to inquire whether the failure of various parties to submit their lists would hinder the scheduled convening of the National Assembly. Wu and Zhang's replies were similar, stating that the convening of the National Assembly was in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and that people from various parties could attend and participate at any time. The National Assembly would reserve seats for them. As for the issue of alternates attending, it was difficult to implement due to the lack of clear legal provisions and many practical difficulties.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] According to Hong Lanyou, Deputy Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the National Assembly, the National Assembly is scheduled to convene on November 12th, and this has been confirmed and will not be changed. The convening order had already been issued by the government. Today's notice is a supplementary announcement based on the detailed rules for implementing the election law, issued by the government, requiring registration. Currently, there is still a month before the meeting, and representatives from various regions can arrive in time. The government still hopes that various parties can submit their lists as soon as possible. Transportation will not be a problem. The preparatory work for the assembly is being stepped up and is generally in order.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] The National Government issued an order on the 12th, stating that the National Assembly has been rescheduled to convene on November 12th of the 35th year of the Republic of China. A clear order had been previously issued. Now that the meeting is imminent, all elected and appointed representatives should, in accordance with Article 89 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the National Assembly Representative Election Law, personally come to Nanjing to register at the National Assembly Representative Registration Office within ten days before the meeting, i.e., starting from November 2nd of this year, and submit their certificates of election. The list of elected and appointed representatives will be announced separately. This notice is hereby issued for general knowledge.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department issued the following statement at 8:00 PM tonight: The National Assembly is scheduled to convene on November 12th of this year, and a clear order has been issued. Now that the meeting is only a month away, the government will announce the registration date for the National Assembly representatives tomorrow. The power of the First National Assembly is only to formulate a constitution. As for the constitutional organs established in accordance with the constitution, they must be elected and convened through a national general election within six months after the promulgation of the constitution. The total number of representatives for this National Assembly is 2,050. The allocation of seats for various parties will remain the same as previously agreed. Now that the meeting is imminent, it is hoped that various parties can submit their lists as soon as possible so that the government can announce them at an early date.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Postpones Return to the Capital; The Third Party Continues to Mediate for Peace; The CCP Believes Negotiations Require a Comprehensive Ceasefire</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After several contacts between President Sun and the Third Party, he was originally scheduled to go to Nanjing today, but according to inquiries made by this reporter at Sun's residence last night, the date of Sun's departure has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] After Liang Shuming, Secretary-General of the Democratic League, arrived in Shanghai, the League's leaders in Shanghai met at the China Vocational Education Society. After the meeting, Liang visited Zhou Enlai. However, it is not known whether any new proposals were put forward during the conversation.</p>
<p>The leaders of the Third Party remaining in Shanghai gathered again at the Bank of Communications yesterday. The three proposals they suggested were: (1) The National Army should stop attacking Zhangjiakou indefinitely; (2) Everything should be handled in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference; (3) Reopen the Comprehensive Group of the Political Consultative Conference. It is reported that Ambassador Stuart was notified in advance.</p>
<p>Chen Jiakang, spokesperson for the CCP in this city, announced yesterday: When Zhou Enlai heard of these two proposals, he expressed great sympathy and said that this was the CCP's consistent position, and that he himself "is willing to follow the gentlemen and work for peace." However, the CCP's doubts about the government's determination to cease fire have not yet been completely dispelled. Therefore, Chen still said: Since the Third Party is willing to mediate for peace, the government's troops attacking Zhangjiakou should be withdrawn to their original defense. If this can be implemented, the CCP is also willing to participate in the three-to-five-person, two-meeting proposal put forward by President Chiang in his National Day address, and jointly discuss the method of a permanent and comprehensive cessation of conflict pointed out in the address. Chen did not insist on convening the Comprehensive Group of the Political Consultative Conference, but emphasized that negotiations cannot be conducted while Zhangjiakou is being bombed, and that the method of a comprehensive ceasefire must be discussed first during the negotiations.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] The peace talks remained in a standstill state on the 11th. Government officials stated that the memorandum published by the Communist Party yesterday contained many contradictions in its eleven listed points. The compromise opinion that the Democratic League intends to propose has not yet been published. After Liang Shuming went to Shanghai, it was rumored that he would meet with Zhou Enlai to discuss the matter and urge him to return to Nanjing. At the same time, it was rumored in Nanjing that the Democratic League representatives remaining in Shanghai would return to Nanjing with Liang on the 12th, and that Zhou Enlai would also return to Nanjing tomorrow night. Li Huang of the Youth Party met with Wang Shijie after attending the Resident Committee of the Political Participation Council on the morning of the 11th and discussed the issue of peace talks. At 4:30, he visited Wu Dingchang and Zhang Lisheng. Dong Biwu of the Communist Party had no activities all day and did not confirm the rumors circulating in various newspapers that Zhou Enlai would return to Nanjing that day. Also, Mr. Marshall and Mr. Ma had no political activities. Special Envoy Marshall received Admiral Kirk, Vice Admiral Miller, and Brigadier General Moore, who flew to Nanjing from Qingdao, in the morning. At noon, he and his wife attended a luncheon hosted by Ambassador Stuart and Minister Baidewei. Admiral Kirk also attended.

<p>[Our Beiping Office, 11th Dispatch] A spokesman for the Beiping Pacification Headquarters informed reporters on the evening of the 11th that the National Army completely recovered Zhangjiakou at 12:50 PM on the 11th. According to news from the headquarters of the 11th War Zone, after recovering Zhangbei, the National Army of Fu Zuoyi's troops recovered Huanggangwa, 18 kilometers north of Zhangjiakou, on the evening of the 10th. At 12:50 PM on the 11th, they entered the northern suburbs of Zhangjiakou, and street fighting broke out.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] According to relevant sources, the Lu Ying'ao Army, Dong Qiwu Army, and Liu Chunfang Cavalry Division of our 12th War Zone, under the personal command of Commander Fu Zuoyi, pressed towards Zhangjiakou with thunderous force from the northwest and west gates, entering the city at 2:00 PM on the 11th. Tens of thousands of Communist and Japanese puppet troops were defeated and fled towards the Zhangku Highway and the Weixian and Laiyuan directions. The National Army is now resting and reorganizing its ranks to strengthen its defenses and can drive south to attack the flanks and backs of the Communist troops in Xuanhua and Xiahuayuan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 11th Dispatch] The National Army entered Zhangjiakou from Huanghuaping on the afternoon of the 11th, capturing many prisoners. The city suffered heavy damage, and the Communist troops fled in the direction of the east and west of the city. It is reported that after entering the city, the National Army of Fu Zuoyi's troops immediately launched a pacification campaign. Also, major fires broke out in Xuanhua, Xiahuayuan, and other places on the morning of the 11th. It is reported that the fires were caused by the Communist troops burning down major buildings.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The National Army on the eastern section of the PingSui Railway recovered Yanqing at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 11th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] News from Beiping says that the National Army on the PingSui Railway has broken through the strong defenses of the Communist troops in the Huailai area and is advancing rapidly towards Xiahuayuan.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] The recovery of Zhangjiakou by the National Army has been confirmed by a senior government official, but no details have been reported.

The CCP, on the other hand, stated that they knew nothing about the news of the National Army's capture of Zhangyuan.</p>
<h3>The War in Chahar Province is About to End</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 11th Dispatch] After the news of the National Army's recovery of Zhangjiakou came, all parties were shocked. This reporter visited a certain military authority, who stated that the war in Chahar Province is about to end. Because of this decisive war, the entire North China situation has changed. From now on, the Communist Army's actions will be limited to disturbances, and the political situation can be expected to become easier to resolve. It was also stated that Zhangjiakou is an important military town outside the Great Wall. In terms of military strategy, it is the key to Shanxi, Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Rehe. To ensure the safety of the Great Wall line, it is necessary to control Zhangjiakou. If Zhangjiakou is occupied by the enemy, then Beiping and Tianjin will feel threatened. The Communist Party, after being defeated in Rehe and then in Jining, completely concentrated its heavy troops around Zhangjiakou. It is estimated that the Communist Army within the large encirclement of the National Army in Chahar Province is no less than 60,000 people. The inability of Zhangjiakou to hold out shows the weakness of the Communist Army's fighting power, and the main force of the Communist Army in eastern Chahar, which is resisting the 11th War Zone troops, may also collapse as a result. Looking back at the war in Chahar Province, its prelude began on September 26, when Chief of Staff Chen inspected Nankou and Zhangyuan from the air. On the 29th, the National Army officially advanced. In particular, Fu Zuoyi's troops took advantage of the void and quickly launched an offensive straight to northern Chahar, capturing Shangdu on the 6th and reaching Zhangbei on the 8th. Zhangyuan was captured on the 2nd day. Its impact on the overall domestic situation is great.</p>

The High Court President ordered her to choose three of them in accordance with regulations. Also, the case of traitor Zhou Xuechang, the former mayor of the puppet government in Nanjing, is scheduled for a public trial on the 12th.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Office, 11th Dispatch] The National Army in northern Rehe has entered Chifeng and is turning towards Linxi and Jingpeng. Another route is approaching Duolun west of Weichang and can be recovered within days. The war between Rehe and the Great Wall can be ended soon, and the stalemate between the National and Communist armies in the Northeast will change as a result.</p>

<h3>Shaobo is Emptied; Houses Are Not Greatly Damaged</h3>
<p>[Our Taizhou Office, 10th Dispatch] According to a telephone call from Shaobo, the situation after Shaobo was robbed shows everywhere that the Communist troops' nine months of plundering has exhausted the resources of the town. The goods in the shops are all gone. Only a few small shops still have a small amount of daily necessities. In this battle, there was no major destruction or casualties to residents and houses. The people expressed unlimited joy at the arrival of the National Army. The fortifications built by the Communist troops are quite solid. Also, distorted slogans of the Communist troops, such as "Prosperity of the market can only be achieved by eliminating traitors," are still left on the walls.</p>

<h3>Ambassador Stuart's Double Tenth Anniversary Speech: Deeply Hopes That Pure Patriots in China Will Strive for Unified, Peaceful, and Democratic Politics</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th Dispatch] Ambassador Stuart issued a Double Tenth Anniversary speech, saying: "When the Xinhai Revolution established the Republic of China, I happened to be in Nanjing. Therefore, I had the opportunity to meet the great leaders of the movement and many other people around them. I wholeheartedly sympathized with the goals and ideals of the patriotic men under the leadership of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and never lost confidence in the ultimate success of their heroic revolutionary cause. Their revolutionary spirit of constantly fighting against domestic selfish or reactionary forces and defeating the brutal and resolute foreign aggression to overthrow the Manchu Qing Dynasty is still actively playing its effect. This is especially evident in the students during the Anti-Japanese War. With regard to the national resistance, I have long experienced the extraordinary potential of the patriotism of the Chinese people. Therefore, I deeply hope that under the leadership of the appropriate successors of Mr. Sun Yat-sen at present, all political parties and non-political parties of liberalism, farsightedness and pure patriotism will be concentrated to launch another revolution, to eliminate the national enemies among their nationals who hold narrow partisan views, or are selfish and unscrupulous, or are ignorant reactionary forces. These domestic people are currently hindering the progress of the unified, peaceful and constitutional democratic politics advocated by the martyrs who created this anniversary."</p>

<h3>The Executive Yuan Refutes LaGuardia: There Are No Goods Piled Up in Shanghai Port; The Performance of Materials Shipped to Other Ports Has Been Excellent in Recent Weeks</h3>
<p>[United Press, This City, 11th Dispatch] The Executive Yuan issued a statement today, refuting the statement made by LaGuardia, Director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), at a press conference in Washington yesterday that "Chinese ports are still congested," and listing the details of the work in the past few weeks and a letter from Egerton, Director of the China Branch of UNRRA, as proof. According to the letter from the Shanghai Transportation and Housing Administration Bureau to UNRRA cited by the Executive Yuan, the relief materials transported by the Executive Yuan to other ports in September totaled 96,000 tons, and those distributed in this city totaled 24,000 tons. At present, due to improvements in various facilities and procedures, the monthly distribution of relief materials to this city and other ports can reach 150,000 tons. Egerton also sent a letter to the Executive Yuan last week, praising its work. It is said that the materials shipped to other ports have created a brilliant record. The excellent performance of the relief supplies distributed by the Executive Yuan in the past five weeks is worthy of glory. If this achievement can be maintained, the unrestricted transportation of materials to Shanghai can be realized earlier. According to this branch, only 16,610 tons of relief materials were unloaded in Shanghai in the week ending October 4, but in the same week, 28,788 tons were shipped from Shanghai to other ports, and 19,936 tons were distributed in this city. LaGuardia's statement that 245,000 tons of relief materials were piled up in Shanghai docks is actually only 200,000 tons, half of which are surplus materials purchased from the US military in the South Pacific. Before they are inventoried and repaired, it is not convenient to dispose of them immediately.</p>
<h3>LaGuardia's One-Sided Report</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th Dispatch] LaGuardia, Director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), told reporters today that the ports in China are still congested, and there is no hope of lifting the ban on UNRRA materials shipped to China in the near future. General Rocks will personally investigate the congestion of goods in China, saying that there are currently 245,000 tons of UNRRA goods piled up in Shanghai docks, which is part of the 1 million tons of goods, food, and medicine shipped to China.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th Associated Press] A member of the Central Committee of UNRRA recently accused LaGuardia of using the UNRRA mechanism to achieve his "personal political ambitions," saying that if the US Congress continues to conduct investigations, it will find LaGuardia's incompetence and numerous errors. LaGuardia attempted to allocate 2% of the UNRRA budget as a reserve fund, but refused to disclose its use.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Cripps Reports on Mission to China: In Her Heart She Has a Motherland and Also China</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 10th] Mrs. Cripps, President of the British United Aid to China Fund, held a press conference at 10:00 AM on the 11th to report on her mission and the work of the organization. It is said that her main task in coming to China is to learn about the current situation in China and its post-war plans, as every British person concerned about China is extremely concerned about the above two issues. In addition to Mrs. Cripps, those who attended today's press conference also included her beloved daughter, Peggy, and the organization's secretary, Mrs. Le. Reporters asked many questions. Mrs. Cripps first expressed her feelings about her visit, saying: "For the past four years, I have been working in Britain to aid China, and I have the greatest interest in everything about China. This field visit to the China I have been longing for is extremely pleasant." In reply to reporters' inquiries, she briefly stated: "The plan for this visit to China is still difficult to determine. I plan to go to various places for inspection first and report back to the people in Britain. The Aid China Fund is a very large organization with more than 80,000 staff. Those who voluntarily participate in the work are not included. Only those who participate in the 'One Office Worker a Week Movement' have reached 780,000. Over time, the number is considerable. Those who are willing to donate money voluntarily, even young schoolchildren, will help with all their money, which is very touching." She continued to describe the nature of the Aid China Fund, explaining that participants in this organization include people from the extreme right and the extreme left. Businessmen and industrialists in cities and towns are enthusiastic about donating money. Some donations amount to thousands of pounds, but most of them regularly donate one shilling or one office worker. In fact, it is an organization representing all the people of Britain and is completely independent politically.</p>
<h3>The British government never interferes with the use of donations. The organization also does not make any designations to the Chinese side when allocating funds, except for those specifically designated by the donors. A reporter asked whether she planned to visit the Communist areas for inspection. Mrs. Cripps replied: "This matter depends on time and circumstances, and no concrete decision has been made yet." She also said that some people are propagating that China does not need relief. The Aid China Fund will explain the situation in China and its urgent need for relief to the British people. British workers are very concerned about the situation in China, and aid work can increase their understanding and knowledge of China.</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 11th] Mrs. Cripps told Chinese and foreign reporters this morning that the staff of 5,000 British commercial firms and factories, totaling 780,000 people, generously donate several shillings and pounds every week to the British United Aid to China Fund. She also said: "In my heart, I have my motherland, and I also have China."</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 11th] After holding a press conference on the 11th, Mrs. Cripps visited National Central University at 11:00 AM, attended a banquet hosted by President Wu Yifang of Ginling Women's College at 12:00 PM, and visited the school. At 5:00 PM in the afternoon, she attended a tea party of the New Life Movement Women's Guidance Committee. In the evening, she attended a dinner party of the China-British Association. She is scheduled to fly to Chongqing on the 14th and then go to Lanzhou, Beiping and other places for inspection before going to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Madame Chiang Kai-shek Held a Tea Party Yesterday to Welcome Mrs. Cripps</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Director of the New Life Movement Women's Guidance Committee, held a tea party at the Ningbo Fellow Association at 5:00 PM this afternoon to welcome Mrs. Cripps. At 5:00 PM, the distinguished guests arrived, accompanied by Director Song to visit the exhibition room. Mrs. Cripps was very interested in the Chinese dolls displayed by the Children's Welfare Department. She then entered the tea hall, which was filled with Chinese and foreign women leaders and social celebrities. Director Song first stated the significance of the welcome, dividing it into three points: (1) Mrs. Cripps' enthusiasm, (2) Enthusiasm for donating money to China, (3) Mrs. Cripps has donated 1.8 million pounds to the British Aid China Fund in the past four years, which has been used for 300 units of our schools, hospitals and charitable organizations. Directly and indirectly, except for the four provinces of Chahar, Suiyuan, Qinghai, and Jehol, the benefited areas are almost all over China. Finally, she expressed her deep gratitude. Mrs. Cripps replied briefly, stating that since leaving England via Marseille, Cairo, Calcutta, Yangon, and Bangkok to Hong Kong, it seemed that she had come with the enthusiastic welcome from China. She was especially grateful for the arrangements made for her in Nanjing. The funds she donated came from all parts of the UK and she hopes to use them in all parts of China. She has come to understand China's needs so that she can plan for continued donations. Finally, Mrs. Miller read a letter from the All-England Women's Association to Vice President Chen Jizhen of the Guidance Committee, expressing that Chinese and British women's organizations should contact each other to exchange opinions. At this point, everyone had tea and refreshments. At 6:30 PM, the guests bid farewell to Director Song and Mrs. Cripps with joy. Foreign guests at the tea party included Mrs. Marshall, Mrs. British Ambassador, Mrs. French Ambassador, Mrs. Soviet Ambassador, and more than 100 people including Chinese government leaders and celebrities, Liu Hengjing, and Wu Yifang.</p>

The following is a record of Chairman Chiang's instructions:</p>
<p>[President Bei of the Central Bank also forwarded to all comrades of the business conference: Since the government changed to the legal tender, the position of the Central Bank has become more solid. Since the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Central Bank has made arduous contributions to the country for eight years. Since the victory last year until today, the Central Bank has encountered particularly numerous difficulties due to the excessive burden during the war and the disturbances in various places. Financial waves are imminent, and social expectations are becoming more urgent. The internal and external personnel of the Central Bank are in this difficult environment. The adjustment and response have been painstaking, and the achievements over the years are deeply concerned. At this time, the responsible cadres of various local units are convened to review the business, which is of great importance to the future of financial rectification and economic revival. It must be known that our country has entered the ranks of the five powers in international financial institutions, while the phenomenon of industrial depression and social unrest in our country is extremely serious. How should future financial measures be coordinated internationally and meet the needs of the economy? This is the greatest responsibility of our Central Bank and the most arduous task at present. It is especially necessary for all internal and external colleagues to work together to achieve it. Therefore, internal and external will must be integrated, and then the implementation of policies can be universally implemented without deviation. The personnel structure must be rectified, and then the efficiency of operations can be actively improved and progress made every day. I hope that this business conference will explore the conclusions, without any embellishment, properly formulate methods, and implement them carefully, so that all future operations of the Central Bank can accurately conform to the government's decisions and take on the great responsibility of leadership, creating the grand plan of the bank of banks, spreading its reputation abroad and benefiting the people. I hope and encourage you to do your best. Zhongzheng, October 10th, Fu, Wen.]</p>
<h3>Food Panic and Fuel Shortage: Dalian Becomes a City of Death: The Soviet Union is Busy Moving Supplies and Watching Residents Freeze and Starve</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 11th] According to those who recently came here from Dalian, Dalian is under Soviet control, with food panic and fuel shortage, and this winter will become a city of death. The city has a population of about one million, with little food reserves, and the winter is extremely cold, and all fuel is insufficient to keep warm. Japanese expatriates are particularly distressed, with more than a dozen people starving to death and committing suicide every day. The railway transporting coal, firewood, and agricultural products from the producing areas to Dalian has been interrupted due to the war. Although five or six Soviet ships arrive every week, they are only busy transporting supplies back home and do not know how to relieve the suffering of the people. Although Dalian is nominally ruled by naturalized people, it is actually under the command of the Soviet military authorities. There are still many Soviet troops in the city, but they seem to be in the rear. The population of the residents was only 650,000 before the war, but it has now increased to nearly one million. More than 250,000 Japanese people have come here from Lushun and other places, most of whom are unemployed and lack food and fuel. Other residents also feel the same suffering, and many sell their clothes at low prices to buy expensive food and coal. The major hotels, pier warehouses, and department stores in the city are operated by starving people. Since the beginning of the year, only six foreign ships have arrived in Dalian. In the past, during the winter, there were sometimes as many as 15 ships docked in the port, but now only five or six arrive every week. The Soviet Union has no navy in Dalian, only one patrol boat performing seaport quarantine tasks, but the army seems to be quite numerous and has artillery. A "Police Training School" established by Chinese people in Dalian sends graduates to Antung under the control of the Communist army in batches, about 300 people each time.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Complete Passage of the Italian Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>The Italian Peace Treaty, which has been debated and argued for many months, was completely passed by the plenary session of the Paris Peace Conference on the 9th. According to a dispatch from the United Press, the passage of this treaty "represents the final victory of the Western countries after eleven weeks of verbal battles in the face of fierce opposition from the Soviet Union"; and also said, "The Soviet Union attempted to withdraw the British and American troops stationed in Trieste from the Paris Peace Conference as soon as possible, but the conference rejected it. Therefore, the three major disputes of the Italian Peace Treaty were finally voted on the 8th. The Eastern Group fought again with the Western Group, and the Eastern Group was defeated." According to news reports, the main parts of the Italian Peace Treaty include: (1) the establishment of the Free Port of Trieste under the United Nations organization, (2) the determination of the amount of reparations to Italy, (3) the restrictions on Italy's possession of armaments and the stipulation that Italy give up its special rights in China, etc. Thirty-six articles. From the news transmitted by various news agencies, we can find that even at the last moment, the Soviet Union would not abandon its original position, but rather the laboratory's position did not receive majority support, and was therefore rejected by the conference.</p>
<p>The passage of the Italian Peace Treaty still needs to be ratified by the respective governments before it can take effect. This is the first peace treaty established after World War II. Although Italy participated in the Axis, General Badoglio and King Umberto III of Italy also led their troops to surrender, and some Italian people even participated in the Allied forces against Germany, so Italy's defeat could not be equated with Germany and Japan. However, because of this, Germany and Japan are currently under the occupation of the Allied forces, but the Italian Peace Treaty has been completely passed by the Paris Peace Conference. Since the beginning of the discussion on the treaty, several issues have revolved around the Italian Peace Treaty, such as the reparations issue, the disposition of Italy's former colonies, and the arms limitation issue. Among them, the issue of the Port of Trieste is complex and has been contested for the longest time. Although the various clauses passed by the Paris Peace Conference are not necessarily all the original proposals of Britain and the United States, and most of them are compromise solutions, they are not far from Britain and the United States, which shows the trend of international politics and the trend of international opinion.</p>
<p>In general, the peace treaty concluded with Italy this time does not contain strong revenge emotions, and the provisions are not too strict. Compared with the Treaty of Versailles concluded with Germany after World War I, it is not the same. When the Italian Peace Treaty began to be drafted, the Soviet Union originally demanded the division of Italy's African territories, demanded reparations from Italy, supported Yugoslavia's annexation of Trieste, and opposed the annexation of the Dodecanese Islands to Greece. After several mediations and debates, the Italian Peace Treaty now only stipulates that Italy will pay the Soviet Union US$100 million in reparations, Yugoslavia and Greece US$100 million each, and Abyssinia US$25 million, payable in seven years. The amount of reparations may not be able to satisfy the Soviet Union's desires, but this provision is nothing more than respecting the Soviet Union's opinion. Regarding the disposal of Italy's former colonies, the treaty did not make a clear provision. Article 7 of the Italian Peace Treaty states: "Regarding the fate of Italy's former colonies, the provisions regarding the final legal status of Italy's former colonies will be resolved by the four powers within one year after the signing of the Italian Peace Treaty." Therefore, this issue was not resolved by the Paris Peace Conference, but only postponed the issue to a longer period of time for careful consideration. As for the Trieste issue, the Soviet Union's proposal to support Yugoslavia was not adopted, but the one passed was somewhat close to the original intentions of Britain and the United States, the French compromise plan. Therefore, from these perspectives, the Soviet Union's participation in this Paris Peace Conference must be considered a diplomatic failure.</p>
<p>In the conclusion of this Italian Peace Treaty, France, as the host country, also made the greatest efforts. French Foreign Minister Bidault is a brand new figure who emerged after the war, and with his wisdom and talent, he mediated between the Soviet Union, Britain and the United States. If the Soviet Union's participation in this Paris Peace Conference is a failure, then what succeeded at this Paris Peace Conference was the Fourth Republic of France, which emerged after the war. The Trieste issue was certainly passed based on the French amendment, and in many other issues, it was also passed based on the compromise plan proposed by France, such as the issue of the Italian-Yugoslav border, which was passed by the conference in accordance with the so-called "French Line" division. Reborn France, under the leadership of the "Popular Republican Movement" with Catholic believers as its backbone, is now fulfilling its historical mission.</p>
<p>As for the光明正大 attitude taken by our country in this Italian Peace Treaty, it should be respected by all countries. Our Foreign Minister Wang and Representative Guo Taiqi expressed our concern for the defeated countries from the standpoint of international justice, and did not advocate demanding excessive reparations from the defeated countries that exceeded their ability to bear. As for Italy, we did not harbor revenge because Italy had demanded a large amount of compensation from us during the Boxer Rebellion, and we automatically abandoned the demand for compensation. This solemn stance is enough to add glory to our nation. On the issue of the disposition of Italy's former African colonies, our representative also advocated that Libya, Italy's former North African colony, should be granted independence. The North African region was originally an ancient cultural country, and the intelligence and training level of the local residents is relatively high and cannot be compared with the residents of central Africa. It should be granted independence as soon as possible to satisfy the wishes of its people. This move is another noble manifestation of our national spirit. Although the issue of the disposition of Italy's former African colonies has not yet been resolved, our country's position of supporting the ruled nations so that they can independently build their countries should be respected and may not be a way to solve the North African issue.</p>
<p>The Italian Peace Treaty has been completely passed, but the treaty itself is not necessarily a guarantee of peace. How to ensure lasting peace should be the goal of the great powers' efforts in the future. To ensure lasting peace in the world in the future, it will not lose the meaning of revising the Italian Peace Treaty.</p>

<h3>How Should National Schools Implement the Two-Shift System?</h3>
<p>— Hu Chaolun</p>
<p>During the war of resistance, various places suffered greatly from military disasters, and cultural institutions were almost completely destroyed. The schools run by the enemy and puppets, being crude and simple, were also reduced to a precarious state. After the victory, all the refugees with rear areas returned one after another. At the beginning of educational rehabilitation, due to the insufficient number of school buildings and equipment, many students were unable to attend school. At the present time of high prices and difficult educational expenses, it is indeed difficult to add a large number of school buildings and purchase a large amount of equipment in a short period of time. To solve the urgent problem of students not being able to attend school, the most simple and easy way is to implement the two-shift system.</p>
<p>The first to propose this two-shift system was the editorial of the "Shen Bao" on August 18, followed by the trial implementation by the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, and most recently, the Ministry of Education has issued a general order to all provinces and cities to promote it. It can be seen that this is indeed an emergency measure for national education. In fact, the two-shift system did not start today. In June of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), the Ministry of Education promulgated a method for implementing the two-shift system, which stated that the two-shift system has the following types:</p>
<p>1.  Full-day, Two Classrooms, Two-Shift System - Two classrooms simultaneously accommodate two classes of children of the same or different levels, taught back and forth by one teacher. The classrooms are best connected, or in the shape of a "日" (sun) character, with a door in the middle for the teacher to move between.</p>
<p>2.  Full-day, One Classroom, Alternating Two-Shift System - One classroom and one other place (such as the playground, enclosure, library, auditorium, etc.) simultaneously accommodate two classes of children, who take turns entering the classroom, taught by one teacher. Children not directly being taught are either self-studying under the guidance of a student leader or engaged in other activities.</p>
<p>3.  Half-day, Two-Shift System - One classroom accommodates two classes of children, with teaching in the morning and afternoon, taught by one teacher. This two-shift system is divided into the following two forms:</p>
<p>A.  Children are in school all day, practicing in the classroom for half a day, and engaging in free work or activities in other places under the leadership of a student leader for half a day.</p>
<p>B.  Children are in school for half a day, and for the other half of the day away from school, the teacher assigns extracurricular work, instructing the children to study on their own.</p>
<p>4.  Full-day and Half-day Mixed Two-Shift System - Two classrooms accommodate two or three classes of children, one class in school all day, and the other two classes in school alternately in the morning and afternoon. The teaching time for the full-day class and the half-day class must be arranged alternately. When the half-day class is being taught, the full-day class should be assigned to self-study or extracurricular work.</p>
<p>5.  Alternating-day, Two-Shift System - One classroom accommodates two classes of children, who are taught in turn on alternating days; the class not being directly taught should be assigned to self-study or extracurricular work.</p>
<p>The difference between the two-shift system and the ordinary class system has been described above. The issues that should be paid attention to during implementation can be explained in the following three aspects.</p>
<p>A. Education Administration Authorities</p>
<p>1.  Whether or not the two-shift system should be implemented in a particular elementary school district should be determined by the competent education administration authority. The basis for the decision should be a survey of school-age children. Determine how many children are not attending school in the district. In addition to the need to increase the number of schools and grades, determine how many can be taught using the two-shift system, and then allocate them to the existing schools, using the two-shift system.</p>
<p>2.  If there is no significant shortage of teachers in the school district, the two-shift system should be assigned two qualified teachers. At the very least, there should be one qualified teacher and one substitute teacher. Otherwise, with too few people, difficulties will arise, and it will be easy to fail.</p>
<p>3.  When implementing the two-shift system, self-study or extracurricular work should be assigned to the class not being directly taught. Self-study and extracurricular work require books, instruments, labor tools, games, etc. Therefore, the education administration authority should provide the necessary equipment expenses for application.</p>
<p>4.  The number of students per grade in the two-shift system is doubled compared to ordinary classes. All office expenses should be increased by at least 70%, so the education administration authority should also increase office expenses based on actual needs.</p>
<p>5.  Teachers who implement the two-shift system have heavier responsibilities and are busier than teachers who teach ordinary classes. They must be selected for their strong abilities, high skills, and service spirit in order to be competent and happy. These good teachers are not easy to recruit. Their treatment must be appropriately improved, and they must be given all kinds of spiritual encouragement.</p>
<p>6.  The two-shift system reduces the amount of direct teaching time due to the doubling of the number of students. This shortcoming must be compensated for by guiding self-study or extracurricular work. Therefore, the allocation of curriculum, teaching materials, and daily schedules is very important. Solving this problem is not only a matter for the teachers themselves. Research and training institutions and supervisors should also be responsible for working together to achieve success. The overall success depends on the education administration authority.</p>
<p>B. Schools</p>
<p>1.  The methods of the two-shift system have been described above. When implementing it in schools, it is also necessary to adapt to local conditions and decide which method to use. For example, if the number of elementary school children exceeds one grade but the school buildings and equipment are sufficient, the full-day, two-shift system should be used. If the number of children exceeds one grade but they cannot attend school all day, and the school buildings and equipment are insufficient, the alternating-day, two-shift system should be used. If children cannot attend school every day due to transportation or family reasons, the alternating-day, two-shift system should be used. If there are special needs in teaching for teachers and learning for children, the full-day and half-day mixed two-shift system can be used.</p>
<p>2.  Teachers who are responsible for the two-shift system should be fully prepared before class. It is best for teachers to consider and allocate the parts of the teaching materials that must be taught directly and the parts that can be self-studied, and compile simple lesson plans for teaching. At the same time, they must provide effective guidance to students' self-study to prevent them from going down the wrong path, and they must also strictly assess and verify the results of their self-study.</p>
<p>3.  All teachers and staff of the school should work together, regardless of boundaries, and help the two-shift system classes as much as possible. This kind of help is not limited to material help, distributing the places and equipment that the school can use as much as possible to the two-shift system for application. It also involves helping to solve the difficult problems encountered by the two-shift system and providing assistance in work and spiritual encouragement.</p>
<p>C. Students' Parents</p>
<p>1.  As parents, the most painful thing is the problem of their children not being able to attend school. After this great war, school buildings are a big problem, and schools lack material equipment to an extreme degree. Only by implementing the two-shift system can we temporarily deal with the emergency and solve the current problem of students not being able to attend school. It should also be clear that the effectiveness of the two-shift system, if implemented properly, is no less than that of the ordinary system. Students' parents should not have a skeptical attitude.</p>
<p>2.  The quality of teaching techniques depends on whether they are used properly. If they are not used properly, teachers and students can face each other all day and still gain nothing. The teaching situation of the two-shift system is slightly different from that of ordinary classes. Students' parents should understand that the wonderful use of the two-shift system lies in its ability to guide self-study and extracurricular work. It must not be regarded as laissez-faire, as a waste of time, or to criticize the school for its shortcomings.</p>
<p>3.  After students' parents understand the two points mentioned above, when two-shift system students are at home, parents should pay attention, supervise their self-study, and provide sufficient guidance to supplement the teacher's shortcomings.</p>
<p>The two-shift system was originally implemented to promote compulsory education, and the Ministry of Education has issued an order for its implementation. Over the past decade, its effectiveness has not been great due to the impact of the war. Now that we have returned victorious, the two-shift system can be used to supplement compulsory education, not only to relieve the current situation of children not being able to attend school. Now that it is being promoted, this article is written to seek advice from experts.</p>

<h3>Mao Sen Discusses the Suppression of Bandits in Jiangnan; Bandit Troubles Can Be Completely Eliminated by the End of this Month</h3>
<p>[Report from Wuxi by this newspaper] Since the establishment of the Wuxi Command Post of the Capital Garrison Headquarters in early September, it has been actively carrying out the suppression of remnant bandits in the Jiangnan area, and it is scheduled to be fully completed by the end of this month. General Mao Sen, Chief of Staff of the Command Post, gave a speech to reporters on the eve of National Day, reviewing the current security situation in each suppression zone and joint defense zone, saying that after the establishment of the Command Post at the beginning of last month, the command headquarters of the suppression zone and joint defense zone were successively established, launching a large-scale comprehensive suppression. In the past month, there have been no more bandit gangs in the Chongming and Pudong areas. The bandit gang of Liao Bingnan and others in the Taihu suppression zone has also been officially incorporated. There are still dozens of bandits, such as Xue Yonghui, roaming in the area. The main force of the bandit gang of Li Defu in the Yangcheng Lake suppression zone, more than 200 people, has been defeated. The bandit gangs in the border area of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, such as Zhang Ziyi and Xu Daojin, have unknown strength. Since the launch of the suppression, the bandit gangs have adopted a strategy of breaking up into smaller groups and hiding among the people. We are now strengthening the Baoshengjia system and searching for the bandits. The bandit gang of Xue Bin in the Maoshan suppression zone has been wiped out. The Changdanyang area is under siege. In the Xicheng area, only scattered bandits such as Zhao Jianping and Zhang Wenlong remain. Before the Jiangnan area began to be suppressed, there were a total of more than 5,000 bandits roaming in various counties, harassing the local area. Since the suppression, there are now no more than 800 people at most, and it will be possible to complete all of them by the end of this month in accordance with the planned plan. Finally, Mao talked about the suppression work of the past forty days. Generally speaking, the local administrative authorities in Zhejiang Province were able to comply with the orders and implement them. The strict Baoshengjia system and the strengthening of self-defense forces were all completed as scheduled. In Jiangsu Province, some county magistrates were perfunctory and failed to thoroughly implement them, which is a pity. In the future, it is hoped that all sectors of the community can unite from top to bottom and cooperate in the suppression so that the planned plan can be completed as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Li Defu's Bandit Gang Suffers a Major Defeat; Entire Group Falls into Encirclement</h3>
<p>[Report from Suzhou by this newspaper on the 11th] On the border of Wutai Island and Jia, a bandit gang of Li Defu, who claimed to be the "New Fourth Army," has been found to be constantly moving around and plundering Yang Zhou and Xiema Bridge, which are located at the junction of Su and Kun. The suppression troops have launched a major sweep, and they have now advanced to the Jinzhuang area of Ducheng, which belongs to Kun. Ma Shigong, the commander of the suppression zone of Yangcheng District, has telegraphed the Qingpu County Security Team to advance to Shangta. It is reported that our army contacted Li's troops near Jinjialou in Kun on the evening of the 9th for two hours. The bandits could not hold out and retreated to Luoxia Pu, Shangming Dian, and Zaze. During the retreat, they set fire to civilian houses in an attempt to divert the close pursuit. The attempt failed. At the moment, the entire bandit gang is encircled by our army, and it is expected to be resolved within days.</p>
<p>[Report from Qingpu by this newspaper] Li Defu, the leader of the guerrilla force that used Dianshan Lake as its base during the occupation, has now degenerated into a bandit gang, calling himself the "New Fourth Army." He robs and harasses in the triangular area of Su, Kun, and Qing. On the 27th of last month, he sneaked into the territory of the 2nd and 8th districts of this county. After being encircled and suppressed, he fled to Kunshan Yang Zhou Jing, where he confiscated all the guns of the town's self-defense team. At about 3:00 a.m. on the 7th, a group of more than 30 men from Li's gang, riding two foot-powered boats, sneaked into the territory of the 8th district of this county, attempting to confiscate the guns of the Baihe Town self-defense team and loot the town. Fortunately, it was detected early. After receiving the report, the county government, County Chief Liu immediately led a team to intercept them. The bandits fled back to the mountains and lakes to hide. They are now being searched and suppressed.</p>
<p>[Report from Kunshan by this newspaper] The bandit Li Defu's gang has actually plundered and kidnapped people in Yangxiang and Xiema Bridge in this county. The other day, County Chief Shen personally led his troops to the countryside to encircle and suppress them, and established close contact with the Qingpu Security Team to intercept them in the Shangta area. At the same time, Liao, the district chief of Chenmu in Wu County, also led his troops to suppress them.</p>
<p>[Another report] Shao Qingeng, the head of Baimi Township in Yangzhou District of this county, was found to be in collusion with bandits. The authorities have executed him on the spot to rectify public sentiment.</p>
<h3>Housing Shortage in Hangzhou Leads to Frequent Disputes</h3>
<p>[Report from Hangzhou by this newspaper] The housing shortage in Hangzhou is quite serious, and disputes arise from time to time. The Hangzhou Housing Dispute Mediation Committee was organized.

<h3>Chief of Changshu Police Bureau Sells Guns Without Authorization</h3>
<p>[Report from Suzhou by this newspaper on the 11th] The Suzhou Provincial District Commissioner's Office recently received a joint accusation from people from all walks of life in Changshu County against Yang Chuntong, the chief of the county police bureau, for corruption and dereliction of duty. The accusation listed seven major crimes, including: (1) extorting bribes from subordinates and shielding subordinates, exercising illegal powers; (2) a police officer in Dongsi City caught gambling and illegally collected fines, and Yang knew about it but did not severely punish him; (3) selling one hundred short guns that had not been pre-paid, etc. The Commissioner's Office has now sent personnel to Yu to investigate thoroughly.</p>
<h3>Chief of Mudu District in Suzhou Accused of Soliciting Bribes and Dereliction of Duty</h3>
<p>[Report from Suzhou by this newspaper] The First Pacification District Headquarters recently received a secret accusation that Qin Xigui, the chief of the Second District (Mudu) of this county, had committed bad deeds such as soliciting bribes, and telegraphed the Suzhou County Government on the 9th to investigate and report thoroughly. The details are as follows: (1) Li Genlin, a gangster from Xukou Township in the second district of the county, relied on his power during the war to forcibly occupy the farmland of Li Peifu, a villager in the township, and forced him to sign a deed of absolute sale without compensation. After the victory, Li Peifu reported Li Genlin's crime to the Second District Office and demanded the return of the farmland. The defendant, fearing punishment, bribed Yuan Hao, the head of Jiaoshan Township, to settle the matter, ordering Li Genlin to return the occupied farmland to the plaintiff, and not to deal with the rest. After recovering the lost farmland, Li Peifu prepared gifts of local products and presented them to Qin. However, Qin rejected them, saying they were too light, and instructed Li Peifu to repay the cloth store's debt of 150,000 yuan (equivalent to 30 million yuan in puppet currency last September). Li had no choice but to borrow money to repay it. A year later, he was reported. (2) Cao Songping, the head of Hengtang Town in the second district, was accused of being a traitor. District Chief Qin repeatedly received orders from the county magistrate to detain him, but he did not comply with the arrest, so Cao was able to flee. (3) The position of town head of Fengqiao Town in the second district has been vacant for two months. The citizens have repeatedly requested a legal election to produce a replacement, but he has ignored them and finally appointed a private person to take over. The citizens of the town are now jointly submitting a petition to the county to stop the appointment. A reporter from this newspaper talked to County Chief Yuan about the above problems in passing. Yuan said that at this time of clarifying officialdom and establishing a sound grassroots politics, the existence of empty ink officials must not be allowed. Moreover, the relief of rural suffering after the war depends on the integrity of grassroots self-governance personnel. Therefore, he has decided to investigate this case impartially.</p>
<h3>Qianjiang Bridge to Build a Motor Vehicle Lane</h3>
<p>[Report from Hangzhou on the 11th by this newspaper] The bidding for the construction of the Qianjiang Bridge's motor vehicle lane has been won by the Shanghai Southeast Construction Company. The Bridge Engineering Office has now commissioned Engineer Yuan Zhigang of the China Bridge Company to come to Hangzhou to preside over the project. He has already surveyed the site and is building a workshop today. However, this time, due to the limitation of funds, only wooden boards will be used, with the aim of opening to traffic in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3>Hulong Street in Suzhou Renamed Zhongzheng Street to Celebrate Chairman's Birthday</h3>
<p>[Report from Suzhou by this newspaper] The County Provisional Assembly held its 23rd Resident Committee Meeting at 3:00 p.m. on the 9th. The meeting was chaired by Speaker Dong Sheng. Three important resolutions were made, which are listed below: (1) Gambling and opium are prevalent in various townships and districts of this county, and the ban is difficult to enforce effectively. Now that the autumn harvest is approaching, the rural economy is showing some recovery. It is urgently necessary to actively eliminate gambling and opium in order to preserve a fraction of the vitality of the rural economy. The County Government should be immediately informed to reiterate the ban and set a deadline for the ban, and to send personnel to supervise at any time. If any are found, the administrative heads at all levels shall be jointly and severally liable. At the same time, all district offices should be notified to work with local party and government agencies to organize the New Life Movement in order to promote thrift and create a good social atmosphere. (2) Chairman Chiang's 60th birthday is approaching. To honor the principle of thrift, all extravagant celebrations will be abolished. However, in order to express respect, it has been decided to rename Hulong Street in this county as Zhongzheng Street, and to present a signed birthday book and a birthday banner to show permanent celebration. (3) The operation of public buses by the Jinshan Company in the urban area does not comply with the regulations of the provincial government. The county should truthfully report this to the Provincial Department of Construction for verification.</p>
<h3>Wuxing Dredges Rivers</h3>
<p>[Report from Wuxing by this newspaper] All sectors of Wuxing have organized a water conservancy association to dredge rivers in the urban and rural areas, using work as a form of relief. The heads of various agencies and the directors of groups serve as members. The following resolutions have been made: (1) Dredging the Xiangshi River requires 343,216 catties of noodles. A continued application will be made to increase the allocation. (2) The work-relief materials for dredging the Taichao, Xuanjia, Yangdu, and Zhangpo three ports have been allocated 300 bags of rice (100 pounds per bag). Shen Zhongsheng and Shi Jianmin have been publicly recommended to negotiate for collection and store them in the Beiqian Changhao for issuance. (3) Regarding the implementation of the project, the association will notify the Dredging Port Association to implement it in accordance with the plan. (4) In the case of the Deng Shezhen Zhen Zhang's request to survey and repair the Tang, it is estimated that the two members, Pan Xixia and Yu Lin, will invite Captain Yan of the 12th Engineering Team to conduct a preliminary survey before making a comprehensive plan for construction. (5) The dredging of the urban Xiangshi River will commence on October 16. The noodles that have already been collected will be used to dredge the river selectively, and the City River Office will be notified to actively prepare for the construction. (6) In response to the requests from Hongcheng, Tainan, and Ge Fu three townships to send personnel to survey and repair agricultural water conservancy projects, small-scale water conservancy projects that can be handled by voluntary labor within the possible scope should be handled by the township Bao in the project location. If the project is indeed large and a request is made for relief, it should be handled in accordance with the work-relief implementation measures.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Government Understands the Difficulties of County-level Governments; Approves Counties to Increase Tax Items Appropriately, but Must Not Violate the Central Government's Tax Laws</h3>
<p>[Report from Hangzhou on the 11th by this newspaper] Since the central government promulgated new regulations on the financial revenue and expenditure system, Zhejiang Province has felt increasingly difficult financially. Although Chairman Shen has repeatedly advocated a financial policy of living within its means, revenue and expenditure are still not balanced. The provincial budget deficit is over 9 billion yuan, and local expenses below the county level are even more insufficient. Chen Baolin, the Director of Finance, has repeatedly requested the central government to allow local governments to increase tax revenues tailored to local conditions in order to facilitate the development of local government affairs. At the same time, he went to Beijing today to discuss solutions with the central government. The former has already been approved by today's provincial government meeting. A specific example is the autonomy undertaking donation in Yuhuan County, which targets merchants who purchase and sell the county's specialty fish and seafood, with tax amounts ranging from 2,000 to 12,000 yuan. The fundamental policy is not to violate the central government's tax laws. The results of the consultation with the central government are still awaiting Chen's efforts.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou-Huzhou Liner Robbed by Bandits</h3>
<p>[Report from Wuxing by this newspaper] The Datong steamship of the Hangzhou Gongchen Bridge Ningshao Xiangan Company was sailing to Huzhou from the Xiejiacun area on the morning of October 7. Six men in military uniforms, each carrying a rifle, ordered the ship to stop. They fired three shots as a warning. At this time, five bandits, who had been pre-arranged on the ship, also took out pistols and wooden cases. They ordered the captain to stop the ship and prohibited the passengers from making noise. Because the Hangzhou-Huzhou bus service was interrupted, the passengers were extremely crowded. After the bandits on the shore and the ship coordinated, they searched the passengers and robbed them of more than 6 million yuan in cash, as well as gold rings, watches, woolen shirts, and other light items. The total loss was no less than 10 million yuan. A revolver carried by a military officer in uniform was confiscated, but all the paper money on him was returned. At this time, the Hangzhou Zhen steamship passed by and was also intercepted. The amount of the losses was substantial. After the robbery, the bandits told the passengers that they were the Eighth Route Army, passing through this place to borrow some funds. They were quite humble when they spoke. Soon after, they went south. After the ship arrived at Lake Guo, it reported to the Zhejiang Provincial Inland Water Police Bureau, which sent a team to pursue them, hoping to solve the case.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou County Chronicle Compilation Hall Established</h3>

<h3>Zhejiang Province Discusses Whether to Levy Grain Reserves</h3>
<p>[Report from Hangzhou on the 11th by this newspaper] Zhejiang Province's 35th year grain reserve is set at three liters per mu, levied along with the tax. However, the Provincial Assembly has resolved to postpone the grain reserve, so it still needs to be discussed with the Assembly. As for the method of prepaying the land tax in kind by the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Finance, the Provincial Government believes that it is both convenient for the people and can eliminate malpractices, and has decided to comply with it and hand it over to the Department of Finance for the Grain Office to draft implementation measures.</p>

<h3>Armed Returnees Who Besiege the Self-Defense Forces After Returning Home; Members Who Voluntarily Return to Work are Approved</h3>
<p>[Report from Nantong by this newspaper] The Fourth District Commissioner's Office and the Security Command recently telegraphed the county magistrates of Nantong, Rugao, Haimen, Qidong, and Jingjiang, stating that except for Qidong, which is still occupied by bandits, the county towns of the other counties have long been recovered. All refugee return groups that were previously organized should comply with the provincial order and the instructions given by Chairman Wang at the county magistrate symposium convened by the Commissioner's Office on September 30 of this year. After entering the country, the refugee return groups in the counties should be reorganized into county security teams or civilian self-defense forces under the command of the county magistrate in order to avoid disrupting the system. The main points of the instructions are as follows: (1) Except for Chongming, which has not been organized, and Qidong, which has not yet entered the country and will remain organized as before, all refugee return groups in other counties shall be reorganized into security teams or self-defense forces in accordance with the order.

<p>Supplementary Five-Year Ferry Plan</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Having read the Shanghai Ferry Company's five-year plan, I feel that there are some areas that could be improved. I am writing with two suggestions for the company to consider.</p>
<p>(1) Please add a ferry line from Dadaozhan in Pudong to Gongping Road across the river. There are many male and female workers and vegetable vendors from Pudong Avenue crossing the river to the Hongkou area. Before the war, there were ferry lines from Fenshan Wharf and Xiaonanyang Wharf. Now, both of these lines no longer exist. This important ferry line should be restored as soon as possible to benefit the public.</p>
<p>(2) The company only plans to open a line for trucks to cross the river. This may have limited impact on the prosperity of Pudong's market. It is necessary to plan and build special ferries to transport trucks for unloading goods and buses carrying passengers across the river. In this way, goods in warehouses in Pudong or Puxi can be transported without obstruction as long as they are loaded onto trucks, and passengers can get off at their destination after taking a bus (for example, from Yangjing Town in Pudong to the Great World on Zhongzheng Road, and from the Great World to Zhoupu). This would eliminate the trouble of getting on and off boats and crossing the river on one's own. The prosperity of Pudong's market would be unlimited. (Lu Longlong)</p>
<h3>Substitute Mail</h3>
<p>Reply to Small Tenants and a Shanghai Citizen: Regarding the issue of who should bear the housing tax and the increased summer housing tax, we have received a reply from the Municipal Finance Bureau stating: "According to the lease agreement between the housing and the landlord, 'all taxes and levies shall be paid by the tenant and shall not be the responsibility of the landlord.' Before the contract is revised, both parties should be bound by it, but it is not fair in terms of the actual situation. The Bureau has already requested the Municipal Government Council to review this issue. As for the landlord collecting the housing tax when collecting rent, it is inappropriate. The tenant can request the landlord to repay it. If the tax is not returned, they can pursue legal action. The summer housing tax collection standard has been changed to 180 times, and an additional one-time payment for the defense corps uniform fee and epidemic prevention expenses, have all been submitted to and approved by the Provisional Council and the Municipal Council. The Bureau is following orders and has no authority to increase the levy without authorization." We are responding specifically.</p>
<p>Reply to Mr. Someone</p>
<p>Regarding the case of ticket scalping on long-distance buses in Jiangdu, we have received a reply from the Jiangdu County Government stating: "According to the original document, the additional collection of 200 yuan per ticket is because the transportation in this county has been severely damaged. Therefore, with the order from military, party, government, and local figures, a Water and Land Transportation Management Committee was established, and an additional 200 yuan public welfare donation was added to each ticket to cover the cost of improving transportation, etc. There is no overcharge. In addition to forwarding the letter to the committee to thoroughly rectify ticket sales and inspections to prevent the above situation from happening again, we are responding accordingly." On the same day, we also received a reply from the Jiangdu County Water and Land Transportation Management Committee stating: "The prices for tickets from Yangzhou to Liuyi and from Liuyi to Xiannvmiao are all stipulated. Although the routes traveled may vary among different bus companies, the prices are all subject to supervision by our committee," and so on. We are responding together.</p>
<p>Reply to Xu Songsheng &amp; Co.: Regarding your company's request for a refund of the overpaid spring business tax, we have received a reply from the Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance stating: "According to the report from the relevant department: When the case occurred, the Bureau's business tax had been transferred under orders. Due to the urgency of time, we did not have time to review it. The original document has been transferred to the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau for processing. The Finance Bureau is actively clearing such cases, and whether or not a refund should be issued will soon be determined." We are responding specifically.</p>
<h3>The Fate of the Communist Army's Failure Was Already Sealed Su Bei (Northern Jiangsu) Regeneration Records Farmers Who Were Coerced Have Received Assistance to Return to Farming Financial Management Awaits, Transportation is Being Actively Restored</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Zhenjiang, 11th] Since the National Army recovered Suqian and Siyang in the past month, captured Huaian, the Communist Army's base in northern Jiangsu, and cleared the remaining Communist forces near Huaian, the entire situation in northern Jiangsu has completely changed.</p>
<p>After the Communist Army in northern Jiangsu repeatedly suffered losses in Huaiyin and Sisui, they held an important military conference in Huaian, still planning to secure the Grand Canal and control supplies in southern Huai to make a final struggle. Ultimately, the situation was shaken, and it was difficult to secure even a corner, and they still failed.</p>
<p>According to those familiar with the internal situation of the Communist Army in northern Jiangsu, the Communist Army in northern Jiangsu transferred fifteen regiments of elite troops to southern and western Shandong between July and August to assist Chen Yi's Communist Army in Shandong, threatening Xuzhou and Kaifeng. The strength of the Communist Army along the Grand Canal and Xiangxia River was already insufficient, which is why the situation is as it is today. At the beginning of last month, the National Army cleared the Communist Army in eastern Henan, Kaifeng, and western Shandong, Caozhou, and Jining, gaining control of the Limhai East Road intersection. The connection between the Communist Army in southern Shandong and the Communist Army in northern Jiangsu was cut off. Therefore, since mid-September, the food and cotton that the Communist Army in Shandong relied on from northern Jiangsu could not be obtained, and the Communist Army in northern Jiangsu also experienced extreme panic due to a shortage of weapons and ammunition. The fate of failure was thus sealed.</p>
<p>After the Communist Army in northern Jiangsu suffered successive defeats, the morale of the army was shaken, and they were surrounded by enemies on all sides, presenting a declining trend. In late September, when their high-level command hurriedly retreated to Yancheng and Funing, their external communication was interrupted because the radio personnel changed clothes and fled along the way, and no one was responsible. Therefore, when the National Army entered Baoying County on the afternoon of October 6, the Communist leaders and political workers in the city were still slowly holding a meeting to discuss how to defend Baoying and support the Communist Army in Gaoyou. Unexpectedly, before the meeting was over, the bugle calls of the National Army on the southeast sides of the city could already be faintly heard, and the Communist troops defending the city fled like rats.</p>
<p>The most ridiculous thing is that the Communist political workers, who were known for selling fake medicines, changed into peasant clothes before their troops and quietly fled. It is said that among the Communist soldiers encountered and captured by the National Army outside Baoying, some of the so-called "militia" who were captured cried out to the heavens and earth, shouting injustice, and crying pitifully, saying, "We are not militia, we are all law-abiding people who farm the land. We were deceived and arrested by the Communist Party to be cannon fodder. Now, this group of harmful Communist Party members fled when they heard the sound of the Central Army's artillery this morning." It is said that these good people who were coerced by the Communist Army were immediately released after being questioned by the National Army, and they were given clothes and travel expenses to help them return to their hometowns to farm.</p>
<p>Baoying County Chief Shen Naigeng entered the city with the National Army on the afternoon of the 6th and is now comforting the refugees and rushing to handle the aftermath. There is a severe shortage of food in Baoying City, and there are still scattered bandits in the countryside. The first batch of righteous people returning to their hometowns from Yangzhou and Taizhou arrived in Baoying the day before yesterday, and the second batch of righteous people returning to their hometowns set off from Yangzhou and Taizhou today.</p>
<p>The first National Army to enter Gaoyou was Chen's Brigade of the *** Division. This National Army had undergone rigorous training in the recent February, their uniforms were neat, and their discipline was strict. Soldiers used legal tender to buy goods from merchants, and the shops exchanged goods at the copper coin rate. There was no separation between the army and the people.</p>
<p>The currency system in Gaoyou, Baoying, and Shaobo is very chaotic. Some use silver dollars to discount, some use copper coins to replace value, and some use legal tender to replace "resistance currency" and slightly increase its ratio. The military and civilians are feeling inconvenienced. It is hoped that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications will quickly dispose of the "resistance currency," urgently transport large amounts of small-denomination legal tender to the recovered areas, unify the currency system in northern Jiangsu, and quickly restore postal and remittance services to reduce the suffering of the people. This is the only urgent matter in the recovered areas of northern Jiangsu today. It must be done quickly and effectively. The people of northern Jiangsu have suffered enough and cannot be made to feel sad and heartbroken again.</p>
<p>Navigation from Yangzhou to Gaoyou was opened in September, and water transportation from Gaoyou to Baoying was restored yesterday. It is heard that Zhenjiang Fourth Company plans to send ships to test the route to Qingjiangpu (i.e., Huaiyin), and it is expected that transportation between Qingjiangpu and Zhenjiang will be smooth in a week. The highway is currently being planned for repair by the Construction Department.</p>

<h3>Washington Sends Second Note to the Soviet Union The US Insists on its Stance on the Dardanelles The US Has the Right to Participate in Revising the Montreux Convention Turkey Should Still Bear the Sole Responsibility for Defense</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] San Francisco 11th Broadcast: Today, the United States notified the Soviet Union for the second time to stop interfering in the Dardanelles Strait. The new note warned that if the Soviet Union attacks this strategically important waterway or threatens to attack, the United Nations Security Council will be asked to take action. In this polite but firm note, the US State Department fully supported Turkey's opposition to the Soviet Union's request for joint Soviet-Turkish control of the strait. The State Department seemed to want to carefully state its firm stance, so it almost completely repeated every section of the previous note. Official sources said that the new note was approved after President Truman consulted with the Secretary of the Army and Navy. It clearly pointed out that the important interests of the United States not only extend to the Mediterranean but also to the whole world.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 10th] US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith delivered a note from his government to the Soviet government yesterday, explaining the United States' reaction to the Soviet Union's memorandum to Turkey on the 24th of last month. The note reiterated that the United States is a country concerned with the status of the Turkish Straits, and the United States should participate in any revision of the Montreux Convention (i.e., the treaty maintaining Turkey's neutral status in the straits). The US note was also sent to the signatory countries of the treaty, namely Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Turkey, Greece, Romania, and Yugoslavia (excluding Japan and Bulgaria). The note pointed out that Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union agreed at the Potsdam Conference that the status of the straits needed to be adjusted, and the method of adjustment was to revise the Montreux Convention. The conference recognized that all three countries were concerned about the status of the straits and its possible changes. Therefore, the United States could not agree with the Soviet memorandum's statement that the status of the straits was only related to Turkey and the countries bordering the Black Sea. According to the Potsdam Resolution, the negotiations that the Soviet Union and Turkey could hold were only preliminary exchanges of views in preparation for a future meeting of all countries. The United States dared to frankly state in the spirit of friendship: Turkey should still bear the sole responsibility for defending the straits. If the straits are threatened directly or imminently in the future, they can appeal to the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<h3>Peace Conference Discusses Treaty with Bulgaria Four-Fifths of the Seats in the Venue are Vacant Vishinsky Fiercely Criticizes Britain and the United States His Excited Speech Causes Him to Spill a Glass of Water</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] Paris 11th Broadcast: In the plenary session of the Peace Conference this afternoon, a general discussion was held on the treaty with Bulgaria. In the semi-circular representative seats, four-fifths of the seats were vacant. The representatives of Poland, Australia, Canada, and Abyssinia were all absent. The US representative, Caffery, agreed with the various criticisms of Bulgaria adopted by the Balkan Committee, saying that the fixed compensation amount of 125 million yuan was quite reasonable. Soviet representative Vishinsky then spoke. His speech was passionate, his tone trembling, and he waved his hands, accidentally spilling the water in his glass on the interpreter's head, causing a burst of laughter.</p>
<p>Another message: Vishinsky first launched fierce criticism of the positions held by Britain and the United States on Bulgaria, believing that Bulgaria should not be regarded as an Allied warring country, but he praised the democratic new Bulgaria. Regarding the Greek government, he believed that it was politically quite backward and its foreign policy was also questionable. Regarding the first article of the treaty with Bulgaria, which stipulates that territory should be ceded to Greece, Vishinsky strongly opposed it, saying that if Greece submits this proposal to the plenary session of the Peace Conference, it should be rejected because it contains aggressive implications. He also expressed opposition to the Greek compensation clause, saying that it should be handed over to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference for resolution.</p>
<h3>US Decides to Help Defend Greece</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] Paris 11th Broadcast: The US representative expressed his opinion at the Peace Conference today, stating that the United States will participate in any United Nations measures to protect Greece to prevent Greece's security from being threatened by aggressor nations.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper] Paris 11th Broadcast: Yugoslavia demanded at the plenary session of the Peace Conference today that US warships leave the eastern Mediterranean and British troops immediately withdraw from Greece.</p>
<h3>Dispute Erupts Between Polish and Greek Representatives</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 11th] The plenary session of the Peace Conference began at 9:40 this morning, chaired by Chairman Byrnes, to discuss the treaty with Bulgaria. The entire book is the third treaty discussed at the Peace Conference. At the beginning of the meeting, Poland, a member of the Slavic group, reiterated its request that the narrow strip of land on the Aegean coast of Greece be ceded to Bulgaria. Wei made this request in his speech and protested against the Peace Conference Committee's proposal to dismantle Bulgaria's armed forces on the border with Greece, and Bulgaria's compensation to Greece and South Korea of $62.5 million each, and said: "Poles sympathize with Bulgaria, because we are Slavic countries, but the imagined Slavic group does not exist. Some people do not like this democratic republic, and Bulgaria is one of them. They are prepared to use any means to undermine it, such as overstepping their authority to interfere in the internal affairs of these countries and discriminating against them internationally." Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris immediately replied, urging the Peace Conference to cede a narrow area of the Bulgarian border to Greece to protect the Thrace region from possible aggression, and criticized Western countries for making concessions on border issues, unaware of Greece's war merits. He also said that according to the terms of the treaty, Bulgaria is now stronger than before, after fighting the United Nations for the second time.</p>
<h3>Treaty with Romania Passed by Vote</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 10th] The Peace Conference today passed the US-British proposal by a vote of fifteen to six, stipulating free navigation on the Danube River, and all the terms of the Romanian treaty were completed. The countries of the Slavic group voted against it.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 10th] During the discussion of the Romanian treaty at the Peace Conference tonight, conflicts arose between the Slavic group and the British and American countries over the issue of free navigation on the Danube River and trade in the Balkans. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov spoke after Bevin, attacking the so-called "money democracy," accusing Britain and the United States of seeking "most-favored-nation" treatment in trade with the former enemy countries in the Balkans, and attempting to implement their "imperialist agenda" in the Balkans.</p>
<h3>Security Council Advances Work British Proposal Includes Five Points Gromyko Speaks at the New York State Chamber of Commerce He Vigorously Defends the Veto Power of the Five Powers</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 11th] British representative to the United Nations Security Council Cadogan published an article in "Free World" magazine, expressing regret over the various appeals submitted by "the Soviet Union and its allies" to the Security Council. It is said that the major powers accuse each other, which is tantamount to placing the greatest pressure on the walls of this peace organization before they are dry. It is worth noting that none of the eleven representatives of the Security Council has expressed satisfaction with the progress of the General Assembly. Cadogan specifically proposed the following five points to make the work of the Security Council effective: (1) Countries should consult and mediate before the meeting to reach a consensus. (2) The veto power should not be used frequently. (3) Military and economic plans should be completed quickly to support the resolutions of the Security Council. (4) Constructive efforts should be made on matters that the Security Council may carry out. (5) The Security Council should not be used as a propaganda machine.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 10th] Soviet representative to the Security Council Gromyko addressed 500 New York business tycoons at a special meeting of the New York State Chamber of Commerce today, and defended the veto power of the five powers. Gromyko's remarks were an implicit response to those who criticized the veto power of the five powers. He reiterated that the foundation of the United Nations lies in the "unanimity" of the opinions of the five powers. He also warned that any effort to change the veto power of the five powers would make this world organization "weak and incompetent." Gromyko also said at the United Nations today that the Soviet delegation opposes any attempt to amend the UN Charter, and pointed out that the charter provisions are the backbone of the UN organization, and the entire organization is supported by it, so it must be an immutable law. Gromyko expressed optimism about the future of the United Nations, explaining that the fact that the Soviet Union is not only a member of the United Nations but also a founder of the United Nations is enough to explain the reason for optimism. The Soviet Union firmly believes that if member countries establish and strengthen the UN organization, develop international cooperation, and strengthen good-neighborly relations between countries around the world, the United Nations can become a valuable tool for striving for peace.</p>

<p>Truman Denies Providing Britain with Atomic Bombs</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 10th] President Truman revealed at a press conference today that Prime Minister Attlee had submitted a protest regarding Palestine to him last weekend, and he had replied to it.

<h3>Requests for Sentence Reduction for German War Criminals Rejected by the Control Commission The Soviet Union Declares that Papen and Two Others Should Not Be Released France Demands the Trial of Four Guilty Nazi Groups</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 10th] The Allied Control Commission held a meeting yesterday and today to review requests for sentence reduction for German war criminals. The representatives of the four countries present were General Koenig, commander of the French occupation forces, Air Marshal Douglas, commander of the British occupation forces, Lieutenant General McNarny, commander of the US occupation forces, and General Sokolovsky, commander of the Soviet occupation forces, chaired by Koenig. The application for sentence reduction of 16 German war criminals was reviewed one by one, and it was believed that each crime was deserved and there was no possibility of mitigation. Finally, it was decided that all applications would be rejected. Sokolovsky declared at the end of the meeting, "It is my duty to state that my views are the same as those of General Nikitchenko, the Soviet judge of the Nuremberg International Tribunal. I believe that the German war criminals Schacht, Papen, and Frick should not be released but should be convicted. Hess should not be sentenced to life imprisonment but should be sentenced to death. At the same time, the German General Staff of the Hitler government and the various agencies of the German Supreme Command should be convicted. During the International Tribunal's trial, it was proven that Schacht helped Hitler carry out financial and economic aggression during his tenure as Minister of Economy; Frick colluded with the late Minister of Propaganda Goebbels to poison the Germans with Nazi propaganda for many years; and former ambassador Papen was an accomplice, and the evidence was solid. How can these three people be said to be innocent? As for the former Hess, who was Hitler's party representative and the third most important figure in the Nazi regime, he is responsible for all the evils of the Nazis. How can he be treated leniently? The world's sentiment regarding this person's decision and the Soviet representative's reserved attitude prove that the court's judgment against this person was inappropriate." The Control Commission also decided that the sentences of the convicted criminals would be carried out by hanging in Nuremberg on the 16th of this month.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 11th] France has asked Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to organize an international committee of experts to establish a judicial mechanism to deal with members of the four Nazi organizations that were declared criminal organizations by the Nuremberg Tribunal. The French government said in a note to the three governments that Nazi groups such as the SS have been declared guilty and their leaders have been sentenced, and it is expected that other personnel must also be related to war crimes. It also hopes that the authorities in the four occupied zones of Germany can cooperate in arresting war criminals.</p>

<h3>War Criminal Mourns War Criminal Tojo Has No Such Interest</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 11th] After German war criminals Goering and others were hanged, it was rumored that Japanese war criminal Tojo had sent a telegram expressing sympathy. When asked about this by someone during the break of the Far East Tribunal today, Tojo denied it, saying that he had not yet met any reporters. Past remarks were all made by the defense attorney Kiyose and attributed to himself. Tojo paced back and forth in the lounge today, smoking an American cigarette, as if lost in thought. This lounge was his former office. The former Minister of the Army, who once dominated the world, is now a prisoner. What else is there to say?</p>

<h3>Military Rebellion in Portugal Lisbon Once Fell into Chaos The Government Adopted Emergency Measures to Quickly Quell the Rebellion</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] London 11th Broadcast: Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar issued a communiqué today stating that the rebellion of the 71st Army that occurred yesterday has been resolved by the Portuguese government. The rebels surrendered as soon as they encountered government troops.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lisbon, 11th] A revolutionary movement broke out in the Porto region of northern Portugal yesterday. Prime Minister Salazar was spending his holiday in his hometown of São Comba Dão when he heard the news and immediately rushed back to the capital. The situation in the capital was once very chaotic, and telephone communication between the capital and Porto and between the capital and Spain was cut off. After Prime Minister Salazar returned to the capital, he immediately convened an emergency cabinet meeting. A communiqué was issued afterwards explaining the course of events. It stated: A number of reserve officers, all of whom had been dismissed or removed from their posts for violating military discipline, colluded with a certain unit of the 6th Cavalry Regiment in the Porto region to plot wrongdoing. The rebels gathered about 70 people and began to advance south from the barracks. The military authorities were informed and immediately took necessary measures to capture the rebels. The rebels finally surrendered without a fight. It has not yet been ascertained what the goals of these rebels were. The troops stationed in various places responded quickly to the incident and participated in suppressing the riots, which is commendable. The situation in the capital has returned to normal today, but special police teams are still stationed at key traffic routes throughout the city, especially at the intersections leading to the north. The army, navy, and the public are still taking precautions.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 10th] According to a report from Madrid, telephone communication between Madrid and Lisbon has been interrupted. Those close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here said that even if Portugal does not truly experience civil war, there must be deep-seated unrest among the people. Salazar is old and weak, and even if his achievements are still good, it will be difficult for him to stay in office for long.</p>
<h3>Lifting of Ban on US Aircraft Overflight Over Czechoslovakia and Hungary</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Frankfurt, Germany, 10th] The US occupation authorities today suddenly lifted the ban on US aircraft flying over Czechoslovakia and Hungary, but military and civilian aircraft are still prohibited from flying over Romania. Military sources in Washington believe the ban was due to Soviet military exercises or other military operations. A Pan American Airlines plane turned back to London yesterday from the Czech capital. According to its pilot, this was probably due to Soviet military exercises scheduled for the 9th to 14th of this month.</p>
<h3>Statistics on Sentencing of European and Asian War Criminals</h3>

<h3>US Army's New Rocket to Debut Soon; Forrest P. Sherman Discusses New Pacific Policy; Twelfth Test Firing of German V-2 Rocket</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Pearl Harbor, 10th] After meetings with President Truman and senior naval officers in Washington, Pacific Fleet Commander Forrest P. Sherman announced here today a new US naval policy for the Pacific, stating that the US Navy should establish strong bases from the Aleutians to Guam. The importance of the Guam outpost is no less than that of the Hawaiian naval base, and it has long been a symbol of US naval power in the Pacific. The US Navy should henceforth concentrate permanent naval facilities, such as warships and naval air bases, in Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, Hawaii, and the Mariana Islands. Forrest P. Sherman also said: "The mobility and range of warships and aircraft are very great, so our outposts must extend beyond Pearl Harbor and deep into the Pacific to be effective." He discussed this matter with Chief of Naval Operations Chester Nimitz in Washington, and Nimitz expressed his strong agreement. Forrest P. Sherman declined to announce when construction of the new Aleutian base would begin.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Chicago, 10th] Secretary of the Army Kenneth Royall today declared that the United States may be able to create a rocket within months that has a range far exceeding that of the German V-2 rocket. Royall denied that the United States is fully armed. It is reported that the United States currently has an army of about one million men, most of whom are scattered in occupied territories overseas. In comparison, the Soviet Union has an army of five million men, leaving the United States far behind.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, White Sands, New Mexico, 10th, via Associated Press] The twelfth firing of the German (V-2) rocket reached an altitude of about 102 miles, two miles lower than the record set on July 30. US Army officials said the rocket's speed today was 3,600 miles per hour.</p>

<h3>Soviets Deliberately Kill Witnesses, Accused by American Lawyer; Soviet View on the Japanese Emperor Unchanged</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 11th] American defense lawyer Blakeney today accused the Soviet Union of deliberately executing important witnesses to prevent them from personally testifying for Japanese war criminals at the Tokyo International Tribunal. Soviet prosecutors had presented the testimony of Rodzaevsky, leader of the anti-Soviet White Russian group, and announced that Rodzaevsky had been interrogated and executed in Moscow.</p>
<p>[Kaizo Sha, Tokyo, 11th] Chief Prosecutor Keenan of the Far East International Tribunal issued a statement today saying that recent news reports had stated that Soviet prosecutors had made statements at the International Tribunal requesting the indictment of the Japanese Emperor. However, after review, the statement did not contain any request to indict the Japanese Emperor, and the news reports were in error.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 11th] Responsible parties here announced today that American intelligence officers obtained a top-secret document of the Japanese Army and Navy at the beginning of the occupation of Japan, detailing the entire plan for Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, the Philippines, and Singapore. A Soviet prosecutor, Koronsky, will present it to the International Tribunal here after completing his presentation of the case.</p>
<h3>Hu Shih-tse Tells Reporters that Trusteeship Council Will Be Established Soon</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 10th] Regarding the plan to place all former mandated territories under United Nations trusteeship, UN Under-Secretary-General Hu Shih-tse explained to the press here that Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of China, consistently advocated justice for small and weak nations, which coincides with the fundamental principles stipulated in the UN Charter. He believes that the UN Trusteeship Council will be established at the next session of the UN General Assembly. The trusteeship system can be realized once the administering countries and their trust territories have established agreements and they have been approved by the UN organization. To date, the United Kingdom has prepared agreements for its African trust territories of Togoland, Cameroon, and Tanganyika, and France has also prepared agreements for its trust territories of Cameroon and Togoland. Belgium and the United States are also preparing agreements for their trust territories of Ruanda-Urundi and New Guinea.</p>
<h3>MacArthur is a Living God, a Reincarnation of the Divine Martial Emperor; Japanese Newspaper Publishes Article to Refute the Myth</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 11th] As the worship of MacArthur by millions of Japanese people intensifies, the liberal Tokyo newspaper Jiji Shinpo published an editorial today warning the Japanese people not to transfer the supreme respect they once held for the Emperor to MacArthur. MacArthur should not be regarded as a "living god" but only as a representative and symbol of democracy. The book "MacArthur's Biography" has sold 800,000 copies in Japan, making it the best-selling book since Japan's surrender, and its influence may not be entirely positive. The Japanese people believe that everything that has happened to the new Japan, down to every grain of food shipped from overseas, is in MacArthur's hands. The Japanese people frankly admit that without MacArthur, they would have endless worries about the future. Some Japanese people are so moved by reading MacArthur's biography that they inquire whether he is a "living god" or believe he is the reincarnation of Emperor Jimmu, the founding ancestor of Japan. Breaking the Japanese people's two-thousand-year-old hero worship and moving towards democracy must begin psychologically.</p>
<h3>The US Government and People Distrust the Communist Party</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chen Yi</p>
<p>[Airmail from this Newspaper's New York Office, September 22nd] What attitude does the United States take towards China's current political and military disputes and economic disorder?</p>
<p>In a democratic country like the United States, public opinion often plays an important role in government policy. Strong leaders like the late President Roosevelt can lead public opinion, but they would never dare to violate it. As for President Truman, he makes his policies based on general trends in public opinion.</p>
<p>Americans have always considered themselves friends of the Chinese people. No country, no nation has received as much sympathy and goodwill from Americans as China. In terms of actual material assistance, the aid China received during the war was only a very small portion of the Lend-Lease program compared to that given to Britain and the Soviet Union. A year after the end of the war, the long-rumored $500 million postwar construction loan to China remains unresolved, although it is still very small in comparison to the US loans of $3.75 billion to Britain and $1.75 billion to France.</p>
<p>The United States is Very Interested in China</p>
<p>However, the United States has always had a very strong interest in China. The dispatch of General Marshall, a major US military and political figure, to China as a mediator, the attention American newspapers and radio stations pay to China's internal strife, and the enthusiasm of participants in debates across the country about the merits of the Kuomintang and the Communist parties all illustrate this point.</p>
<p>However, the situation is not so simple. For Americans, China remains the most difficult foreign country to understand. They feel extremely confused about China's current situation and do not understand the policies of the US government.</p>
<p>One of the prices that must be paid for democratic politics is the existence of groups representing various ideologies. Due to the importance of public opinion, each group must find ways to shift public opinion to its own advantage. The American Communist Party and leftists have always used it to shape a policy of appeasement towards the Soviet Union and the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the American people do not like the Communist Party. They tolerate the Communist Party based on their democratic philosophy, believing that everyone has the right to choose their own political ideology. However, due to the Communist Party's constant incitement of strikes at home and the constant diplomatic difficulties encountered with the Soviet Union and its satellite countries, Americans have become increasingly angry. American law already has provisions to prevent the Communist Party from holding positions in the government, and the US Army also refuses to appoint Communist Party members as officers.</p>
<p>However, despite the various restrictions and antipathy towards the Communist Party within the United States, many Americans sympathize with the Chinese Communist Party. This may seem perplexing, but there are reasons for it.</p>
<p>The American Communist Party Actually Speaks Up for the Chinese Communist Party</p>
<p>The American Communist Party and its supporters have conducted a most successful political struggle in favor of the Chinese Communist Party. They promote the efficiency and loyalty of the Chinese Communist regime, call it democratic, and praise its land reform. They have convinced many Americans that the Chinese Communist Party is the only democratic and progressive element in China and has the support of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this leftist ideological group has also succeeded in undermining the efforts of the Chinese National Government. They accuse our government and leaders of being incompetent, inefficient, corrupt, and undemocratic. They use all kinds of facts and events unfavorable to the Chinese government to consolidate their position. The assassinations of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo are attributed to the Kuomintang secret police, and the expansion of the Communist Party's power is attributed to the government's weakness and lack of popular support. They say that if the United States no longer provides support, the collapse of the Chinese National Government is a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>The American people also do not understand the policies their government is pursuing in China. They do not understand why US troops are still stationed in China, and they do not like being drawn into the vortex of China's internal strife. They do not understand why a coalition government cannot be formed, and like their President Truman, they naively believe that a Chinese coalition government will bring peace and unity.</p>
<p>Realistic Americans say that the Chinese government today must demonstrate its strength, work to restore domestic order, and improve the people's economic conditions. China will receive full support from the American people in implementing Sun Yat-sen's Principle of the People's Livelihood and improving the people's lives, because the American people do not want China to become another totalitarian communist state.</p>

<h3>Air Force Transport Plane Crashes During Test Flight; Four American Pilots Killed; Wreckage Found in Baoshan County</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] An Air Force C-46 transport plane crashed on Tuesday, and the wreckage was only found yesterday in Yuepu, west of Baoshan County. All four American pilots were killed.</p>
<p>The plane was piloted by American pilots McCasey, Ken Beck, Rockheed, and White Lee Nan. Because the plane was originally surplus material and slightly damaged, it had been repaired. This flight was a test flight after the repairs were completed. According to witnesses, the plane fell at a very high speed, falling straight down from a high altitude like an arrow, sinking into the ground by more than ten feet, and the engine was buried in the mud. The accident occurred between 4:00 PM and 5:00 PM on Tuesday, and the wreckage was only discovered on Wednesday afternoon. The cause of the accident is still unknown. Besides the four pilots, there were no other passengers on board. The bodies will be embalmed at the International Funeral Parlor this morning at 10:00 AM, and the funeral will be presided over by Pastor O'Donnell of Jiangwan Airport.</p>

<h3>Engineering Planning Team; Hou Jiayuan Talks; Shanghai-Chongqing Direct Highway Must Be Actively Built; Super Highway to Be Built Between Nanjing and Shanghai; Expand Original Roadbed Between Chongqing and Wuhan</h3>
<p>According to Hou Jiayuan, head of the Engineering Planning Team of the Executive Yuan, the reconstruction of highways is urgently needed during the period when domestic railways and air and water transport have not been universally developed. According to the team's investigation, the Shanghai-Chongqing direct highway must be actively built to facilitate the import of materials from various places into the interior. If it can be completed, the transportation difficulties during the Yangtze River's low-water season can be easily resolved. The original highway between Chongqing and Wuhan has too much damage to bridges along the way. Not only is most of the roadbed broken, but the road surface is also very narrow, and two vehicles cannot pass each other. Therefore, it has been decided to plan for reconstruction, expanding the original roadbed so that four trucks can travel at the same time. The team is currently drafting the engineering plan for this project. The next step is the restoration of the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou highways. The Nanjing-Shanghai highway is now planned to be built as a super highway, with the road surface to be paved with asphalt. The Shanghai-Hangzhou highway can barely be used now, and the bridges and road surface must be replaced. As for the highways in the southwest, they can be connected once the Nanjing-Chongqing direct highway is completed. The Nanjing-Hangzhou national highway has also been restored, and the completion of the national highway network is expected soon. It will be connected to seaports, railway stations, and airports, and its transportation capacity can be universally developed.</p>

<h3>Two American Passenger Ships Affected by Strike; Will Not Arrive in Shanghai This Month</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The American President Lines has three passenger ships scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this month in addition to cargo ships. However, due to the second strike by American sailors, the USS General Meigs and USS Gordon have been affected and have not been able to depart. It is feared that they will not arrive in Shanghai this month. Only the SS Manukai has left San Francisco, but the schedule will be delayed by several days as expected. According to the company's news yesterday, it is expected to arrive around the 15th. The Java Mail Line's Tjisaroea arrived in Shanghai this afternoon with 220 passengers and is scheduled to dock at the Hongkou Gonghexiang Wharf. It is scheduled to leave Shanghai around the 15th, and more than 200 passenger seats have already been booked. The Jebsen &amp; Co.'s Laurits Swenson, coming from New York, sailed directly to Shanghai via Los Angeles and Panama without passing through San Francisco, so it was not affected by the strike and is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 24th of this month.</p>
<h3>French Mail Ship Arrives in Shanghai for the First Time After the War</h3>
<p>The French Mail Line's Song Than, which is the first French ship to arrive in China after the war, was originally scheduled to arrive on the 15th.

<h3>Haihang Joins the Shanghai-Taiwan Line</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has recently increased the number of its ships. To strengthen shipping on the Shanghai-Taiwan line, the company will soon allocate the "Haihang" to join the Shanghai-Taiwan line. Before this, there were a total of five ships operating on the line. However, the schedule is uncertain. All ships operating on this line are cargo ships, and passengers are limited to government officials. Ordinary passengers are not carried. The company previously ordered seven new types of cargo ships from Canada. Four have already arrived, and three have not yet arrived. After these ships are all delivered, the Shanghai-Taiwan line may be strengthened again. As for regular scheduled ships on the Shanghai-Taiwan line, it is feared that they will be difficult to implement in the short term.</p>
<h3>Jiangwan Public Buses to Start Running in Early Next Month</h3>
<p>The municipal authorities have long decided to develop the city center area, and the plan is being carried out in stages. According to Director Zhao of the Bureau of Public Utilities yesterday, the first step of the plan is to set up public bus routes to make transportation to and from the city center convenient. Then the prosperity of the city center will be just around the corner. However, due to the rush to install vehicles, the date of opening may be postponed to the beginning of next month.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Remaining in Shanghai Are So Bold as to Impersonate Our Soldiers and Forcibly Occupy Houses; District Court Concludes Trial and Announces Sentencing on the 18th</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Hattori Masato, from Tokyo, 24 years old, was drafted to Shanghai in May 1945 and belonged to the Akatsuki unit as a private first class. After the Japanese army surrendered, he was requisitioned by the First Supply Area of our Rear Services Supply Command as a truck driver. He only left in May of this year. To avoid being sent back to his home country, he tried to get a job as a technician at the City Party Headquarters' Dredging Company, but he had no salary or work. During this period, Hattori had wanted to join the Third Front Army, but he was unsuccessful. Hattori has a wife, one son and two daughters. After the victory, his residence at 88 Yuqingfang, North Sichuan Road, was taken over by the court. Later, Hattori obtained a badge of our army from a Chinese friend surnamed Zhou and impersonated our soldiers, forcibly occupying a house in the concentration area for Japanese residents in Dongxingli. He was subsequently arrested by the police station and sent to the District Procuratorate for prosecution on charges of disturbing public order.

All of his property was confiscated, except for a reasonable amount retained for the necessary living expenses of his family. Chen is currently forty years old, from Shangyu, Zhejiang, and a graduate of the Law Department of Great China University. He previously engaged in business in Shanghai. During the previous trial, he claimed that he absolutely did not consider himself guilty of holding the puppet positions he held, and listed many current city councilors and well-known figures in the business community who had also participated in the baojia organization, questioning why he alone was being convicted, expressing his dissatisfaction.

<h3>Puppet Police Abduct and Extort; Mud Plasterers Accuse Each Other of Being Traitors</h3>

The defendant admitted to holding the puppet positions but claimed that he was "ordered to eliminate traitors." (2) Xue Asi and Wang Jinsheng, two mud plasterers, were accused of working for the enemy army and were suspected of being traitors. The reason for their arrest was that Xue owed Wang 3,900 yuan in the 30th year of the Republic (1941), which he had not repaid for a long time. After the victory, Wang, together with two armed comrades, went to Xue's place to demand payment, but still to no avail. He angrily reported Xue for being suspected of being a traitor. Unexpectedly, after Xue was arrested, he pointed out that Wang was a fellow worker, so Wang was also arrested, and the High Prosecutor's Office jointly prosecuted them. Yesterday, when the presiding judge asked about Xue's property, he replied, "A bed board, a stove, and a chamber pot." (3) Cai Fusheng, who once served as a policeman at the puppet Jiangning Police Branch, had a conflict with Hu Li in the 33rd year of the Republic (1944) on March 26 due to evicting vendors setting up stalls on Gordon Road. Later, Hu was charged with assault and sentenced to five months by the then puppet court. After the victory, Hu Li filed another complaint with the High Prosecutor's Office, accusing Cai of abusing his power to illegally extort five yuan from each vendor every day. Cai was then prosecuted on suspicion of being a traitor. Yesterday, the defendant denied the extortion in court, claiming that it was retaliation. All of the above cases were adjourned for further hearing.</p>

<h3>Rebuilding Hengfeng Bridge to Facilitate Transportation in the Western Part of Zhabei; Shanxi Road Bridge Will Also Be Repaired</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Hengfeng Bridge (i.e., McKenzie Road Bridge) in the city was completely demolished by the enemy during the occupation. Residents in the western part of Zhabei must detour to travel to and from the north and south of the Suzhou Creek, which is extremely inconvenient. All are eagerly expecting the reconstruction of the bridge. The Municipal Bureau of Public Works, considering that the bridge is located at a vital transportation hub connecting north and south, spans the Suzhou Creek, with frequent ship traffic, and because the span is very long and the load is large, it cannot be handled by ordinary pedestrian wooden bridges. It has drafted two plans: one is to build a steel-framed single-span bridge with a steel-concrete bridge deck; the other is a semi-permanent reinforced concrete pile frame and multi-span bridge with a wooden deck. The Bureau of Public Works estimates that the total cost of labor and materials will be approximately 800 million yuan. The Bureau, because of the large scale of the project and whether the city treasury's budget for the second half of the year can be listed, has submitted a request to the previous municipal meeting for a decision. Now, because rebuilding Hengfeng Bridge can promote the prosperity of Zhabei and facilitate transportation between the North Station and western Shanghai, it has been approved. Once the funds are allocated, construction will begin, and it is expected to be completed by next spring.</p>

<h3>Bold Thieves Steal Briefcase of US Military Officer; Confidential Documents Discarded in Trash; Police Solve Case and Recover Stolen Goods in Four Hours</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] US Navy officers Welke and Peng arrived in Shanghai by special plane from Qingdao at 5:30 p.m. the day before yesterday and immediately drove to the YMCA at 630 Sichuan Road to rest, planning to fly to Japan immediately. However, when Welke and Peng arrived at the Shanghai YMCA, a briefcase containing extremely confidential and important documents, including the complete "Pacific Naval Base Investigation Report" and a copy of the "Naval Survey Report," was suddenly stolen in a fleeting moment. Due to the seriousness of the matter, in addition to immediately reporting to their superiors, they also filed a report with the Huangpu Police Station requesting a search. After receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched Li Yinmin, the acting section chief of the Judicial Section, and officers Li Wenqing, Jia Chunshan, Yuan Shiqing, Sun Bichang, Zhao Jiake, and Zhang Haiming to investigate overnight. At midnight that night, three suspects from Ningbo, Wang Yonggen, Yu Yougen, and Wang Shoufa, were first apprehended in front of the YMCA. According to their confession, the briefcase was indeed stolen by a gang of accomplices, and it was hidden in the Yongfa Hotel at 170 Yuanfang Road, Hongkou. The police officers immediately tracked them down and apprehended Tao Fugen (19 years old, from Suzhou) and Xu Genyuan (16 years old, from Shaoxing) at that location. After interrogation, they directly admitted to the theft. However, they initially thought it contained banknotes, but when they took it to No. 10 Lane 10, Ningbo Road to inspect it, they discovered it was all foreign language papers, so they discarded it in the trash can behind the back door of No. 10, and temporarily placed the briefcase with Wang Jinyuan in the kitchen of that address, intending to sell it, etc. According to the confession, the police officers immediately took the electric torch and escorted the two suspects, Tao and Xu, to the location of the crime to search. Fortunately, the discarded documents were still there, and they were taken back to the police station. They immediately notified Welke and Peng to come and identify them. All the documents, except for slight stains, were recovered without any loss. The case was solved in only four hours, which can be described as remarkably swift. The two American military officers expressed their sincere praise for the efforts of the Chinese police officers.</p>

<h3>Legal Inquiries</h3>
<p>(1) Selling Stolen Inheritance</p>
<p>Chen Lei asks: My late father had four sons, Jia, Yi, Bing, and Ding. In 1934, my father passed away, and the inheritance has not yet been divided. During the war against Japan, Jia took refuge in Yixing, Zhejiang, Yi joined the army, and Ding entered the Fourth Branch of the Central Military Academy in Dushan, Guizhou. As a result, the family was scattered. Unexpectedly, during the war, Jia sold all the inheritance. Bing was unaware of this. After the victory, Yi and Ding returned home successively and learned the whole story. They intend to negotiate with Jia. There are several legal questions to answer.</p>
<p>(1) During the war, is there a basis in current law to recover the sale of real estate at the original price? (2) If four brothers have not divided the property, and one of them sells it, is the contract valid? (3) During Yi and Ding's military service, does the government have legal provisions to protect their property? (4) Is it possible to use the fact that the field mountain properties were still registered under the old owner's name for grain payments in 1942 as a basis for recovery? (5) Since the counterparty to this transaction cannot be found now, can we apply for registration procedures or ask a lawyer to publish a statement of invalidity in the local newspaper?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers] (1) No. (2) No. The disposition of jointly owned property requires the consent of all joint owners. If there is no consent from all joint owners and a contract for the sale of property is concluded with others, the contract cannot be considered valid. (3) The government has regulations regarding "Preferential Treatment for Families of Soldiers Going to War Against the Enemy." You can apply accordingly. (4) It can be used as proof that the property was owned by the old owner before 1942. (5) In addition to applying to the land administration agency and publishing an advertisement stating the previous situation, you should file a lawsuit with the court to confirm the invalidity of the sales contract.</p>
<p>(2) Husband Having an Affair</p>
<p>Lu Guiliang asks: I have been married to my husband for more than a year and have a daughter. After that, he had an affair with a widow, cohabited with her, and had a child each. They live comfortably, while treating my daughter and me like a thorn in their side. I am currently living with my widowed in-laws, but all the expenses for clothing, etc., are earned through my hard work. If I ask him for some pocket money, he will repay me with contempt and abuse. I have heard that your newspaper is a loyal provider of services to the community, so I have legal questions that I would like to ask: (1) My husband has been cohabiting with his mistress for about four years and has had a child each. Last year (1945), the widow and others openly entered the house during my father-in-law's birthday celebration, and all the relatives knew about it. Can this be used as evidence of marriage? (2) If the household registration form is used as a reference, can it be used as written evidence in law? (3) If I file a lawsuit with the court, requesting a divorce, can I claim compensation for damage to my reputation? (4) Where should the children born from the affair be raised? If I adopt them, can I ask for subsidies for living and education expenses? (5) If the divorce is based on a written agreement by relatives, is it legally valid?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers] (1) If the open entry into the house and the knowledge of all relatives are true, and there is a proper ceremony for the open marriage, it can only be used as evidence of bigamy in law. (2) It can only be used as evidence of adultery with a person while being married, but this crime cannot be prosecuted if it is condoned or forgiven. (3) Yes. If you request a divorce from the court based on the other party's bigamy or adultery, but this case cannot be sued according to the law, because in the above circumstances, if you agree in advance, or forgive afterwards, or know about it and it has been more than six months, or if more than two years have passed since the facts occurred, you cannot request a divorce from the court. (4) It should be authenticated by the father, and if there is another agreement, follow the agreement. (5) Valid. According to the above, there should be the signatures of two or more witnesses.</p>
<p>Request for Mushroom Seeds</p>
<p>To the respected editor: I have always admired your wide-ranging knowledge and enthusiasm for public service. I would like to inquire about something. European and American agriculturalists are quite advanced in cultivating foreign mushrooms (i.e., Western mushrooms). I have a great understanding of this and would like to engage in cultivation to increase production, but I have no mushroom seeds yet. I heard before that a farm in Shanghai produces foreign mushrooms, but I don't know the location. I dare to ask your newspaper to investigate and see if there are any ready-made mushroom seeds for sale in the Shanghai market? This is respectfully submitted by An Wenren.</p>
<p>(Note) If any readers know of agriculturalists who have mushroom seeds for sale, please send a letter so that we can inform them.</p>

<p>Chen Guanhong, a 13-year-old student at Bide Elementary School on Xiangyang South Road, Shanghai, cut a vein in his left hand with broken glass while playing at school the other day, causing a gush of blood. He fainted on the ground due to improper treatment at the time. He was rushed to Guangci Hospital for emergency treatment by his family.

<h3>Mayor Wu Personally Serves as Chairman of the Textile Control Committee; Convened a Meeting of Relevant Industries Yesterday; Mayor Immediately Decided on Three Measures</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] At 3 p.m. yesterday, Mayor Wu convened a meeting with the heads of relevant industry associations, including cotton spinning, dyeing and weaving, cotton cloth, and cotton products, at the municipal government conference room. Those present included Shu Yuzhang of the Textile Construction Company, Wu Qiyu of the Sixth District Cotton Textile Association, Pan Shihao of the Dyeing and Weaving Industry, Dong Jiufeng of the Cotton Cloth Industry, Zhou Jiasheng of the Yarn Industry, Xu Zhaohou of the Knitting Industry, and Li Daofa of the Towel Blanket Industry, a total of more than ten people. Mayor Wu first delivered a speech, stating that in the past, the soaring prices of grain had been suppressed through the joint efforts of the government and industry associations, while also dredging up sources and replenishing reserves. Since the implementation of these measures, significant results have been achieved. Yarn and cloth are also daily necessities, and the recent rise in yarn and cloth prices has had a significant impact on people's livelihoods. Therefore, he has specially invited everyone to discuss ways to suppress prices, hoping that a proper decision can be made within the principle of considering costs and obtaining legitimate profits. He also stated that the chairman of the Textile Management Committee was originally Mr. Shu Yunzhang, but now that Shu has resigned, he will be taking on the role concurrently. Next, the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau reported on the current electricity allocation situation:</p>
<p>Director Zhao</p>
<p>He stated that the city's power plant has a generating capacity of only 130,000 kilowatts, and the allocated amounts are: 42,000 kilowatts for yarn factories, 42,000 kilowatts for factories in the dyeing, weaving, wool weaving, knitting, machinery manufacturing, spinning, rubber, and flour industries, and 40,000 kilowatts for other users. Therefore, the power plant has made its utmost efforts to supply electricity to factories. Based on the estimated kilowatt allocations above, yarn factories can produce 60,000 bales of yarn and 500,000 bolts of cloth per month, and flour mills can produce 600,000 bags of flour.</p>
<p>Shu Yunzhang</p>
<p>Shu Yunzhang, General Manager of the Textile Construction Company, said that based on the existing spindles of the Textile Construction Company, 1,300 bales of yarn and 2,000 bolts of cloth can be produced per day, but production is limited by electricity, and currently only 800 bales of yarn are being produced. He requested that electricity consumption by users be reduced as much as possible to increase production and reduce costs. Mayor Wu expressed great sympathy for this and instructed Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau to draft and implement a plan to reduce electricity consumption by users. As for factory downtime, electricity can be used in rotation to avoid waste.</p>
<p>Wang Qiyu</p>
<p>Wang Qiyu of the Sixth District Cotton Textile Association reported on the details of the joint yarn allocation by private yarn factories in the past month, saying that yarn is allocated to factories that actually sell the yarn first, followed by yarn shops, but only to those with existing business relationships. The origin of the black market for cotton yarn is actually due to strong sales and limited production, resulting in demand exceeding supply. There are currently 2.4 million spindles operating in yarn factories across the country, producing 6,000 bales of yarn per day, which is less than half of the number of spindles before the war. The allocated prices are in accordance with the principle of fair prices. For example, 20-count yarn has gradually decreased from 1.4 million yuan to 1.3 million yuan, and the second adjustment was to 1.55 million yuan, but the black market price has exceeded 2 million yuan. To suppress yarn prices, production must be increased to balance supply and demand. Private yarn factories are working hard on this.</p>
<p>Pan Shihao</p>
<p>Pan Shihao of the Dyeing and Weaving Industry said that there are many reasons for the high market prices of yarn and cloth and the occurrence of the black market. The method of suppressing yarn and cloth prices, as the mayor said, must take into account the costs of manufacturers and the legitimate profits of trading houses, while also increasing production as much as possible to balance supply and demand. However, balancing supply and demand cannot be achieved quickly under the current circumstances, and this point deserves attention. Currently, joint cotton yarn allocation is limited to yarn factories in the urban area, and yarn factories may not feel it is fair. Attention should be paid to the fact that dyeing and weaving, yarn, and cloth businesses have been forced to purchase yarn and cloth from factories, and their assets have been depleted. Furthermore, interest rates are currently high, and they are indeed unable to hoard goods and raise prices. The fact that the cloth opened by Textile Construction Company last Saturday was sold at a reduced price on Monday this week can serve as proof. I also serve as a representative of the Cotton Cloth Industry and know more details. As for the yarn allocation by Textile Construction Company and yarn factories, there are indeed rumors on the outside. If the industry association could be allowed to participate, the abuses could be reduced, but unfortunately, the authorities have not adopted this suggestion earlier.</p>
<p>Zhou Jiasheng</p>
<p>Zhou Jiasheng of the Yarn Business said that since the exchange rate fluctuations, Textile Construction Company has not made any allocations, and private yarn businesses have also rarely received allocations through joint allocation, but the black market for yarn in the market continues to exist, which is deeply puzzling.</p>
<p>Li Daofa</p>
<p>Li Daofa of the Towel Blanket Industry said that Textile Construction Company said it would specifically allocate 16-count yarn to their industry, but the quantity is very small, and he requested a significant increase in the allocation. General Manager Shu of Textile Construction Company explained that because Textile Construction Company has very few machines that can spin 16-count yarn, and most of them spin 16-count coarse yarn, the costs are also higher, so the production is not high, and the allocation is naturally small.</p>
<p>Xu Zhaohou of the Knitting Industry said that yarn is allocated equally to all factories, but the amount is very small. Many factories are currently suspending operations, and products cannot meet demand. He hoped that an appropriate supply would be made according to the production capacity of each factory. Later, General Manager Shu of Textile Construction Company and Mr. Wang Qiyu of the Sixth District provided corrections to the statements made by various industries.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu</p>
<p>Finally, Mayor Wu said that past events can be left unexamined. The current decision is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Yarn factories should promptly report their production equipment, production quantity, market inventory quantity, and actual sales situation for the previous month in a register.</p>
<p>(2) Cotton product manufacturers should promptly report their production equipment, actual yarn purchases for the previous month, and future needs in a register.</p>
<p>(3) Yarn and cotton cloth businesses should promptly report their sales volume and account names for the previous month, as well as the amount of legitimate profits, in a register.</p>
<p>Regarding electricity for factories, Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau said that he has recently requested the Relief Administration to allocate three generators. The power company's original "1,500-pound generator, a 24,000-kilowatt generator tendered by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and the power company's generator being repaired in the United States" will solve the electricity problem once they are all shipped to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Minister Wang In view of the repeated surges in cotton cloth prices in this city, which has had a significant impact on people's livelihoods, Premier Song Ziwen of the Executive Yuan, while in Shanghai the other day, not only instructed Mayor Wu to take definite responsibility for suppressing prices, but also summoned the textile industry magnates Shu Yunzhang, Wu Weijing, and Rong Hongyuan of the private textile industry to earnestly discuss assisting the government in stabilizing cloth prices. When Song left Beijing for Qingdao, he instructed Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu to assist Mayor Wu in stabilizing cloth prices. Wang arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning and personally inspected the Textile Construction Company at around 3 p.m. It is said that at 12:30 p.m. today, he will accept Mayor Wu's invitation for lunch at Mayor Wu's residence, and Shu Yunzhang, General Manager of the Textile Construction Company, will also participate. Furthermore, Minister Wang will personally attend and preside over the board meeting of the Textile Construction Company at 3 p.m. today.</p>
<h3>Distribution of Rayon; Textile Construction Company Makes Final Distribution Yesterday; Future Responsibility to be Borne by the Central Trust Bureau</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Textile Construction Company, acting as an agent for the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau to distribute rayon, made its last distribution last Thursday. However, the rayon market situation was again agitated yesterday. Textile Construction Company, at the request of the Management Bureau, acted as an agent for distribution once more. The distribution price remained the same, but the quantity has increased to more than 500 cases, totaling more than 1,600 bales. It is reported that silk weaving factories have priority. Generally, each factory with two looms can be allocated one case. According to Jiang Dixian, Director of the Business Department of Textile Construction Company, this is the last distribution. Textile Construction Company is too busy with its own business to take care of it. Starting next week, rayon distribution matters will be handled entirely by the Central Trust Bureau.</p>
<p>It is understood that after the Central Trust Bureau shipped more than 4,000 cases of rayon from Japan, it is currently drafting distribution methods. It may distribute twice a week according to the actual needs of each silk weaving factory. Currently, it is handling the registration of silk weaving factories. The Central Trust Bureau will conduct on-site verification based on the registration forms filled out by each factory to determine the reasonable needs of all. As for the rumors that the Central Trust Bureau will exclusively allocate to producers and Textile Construction Company will exclusively allocate to merchants, neither the Central Trust Bureau nor Textile Construction Company could confirm this.</p>
<p>Rayon No. 120 Tianqiao Youguang opened at 4.3 million yuan yesterday morning, which was 200,000 yuan higher than Wednesday. The timing of Textile Construction Company's distribution yesterday caused speculators to blindly drive up the price, with the highest bid reaching 500,000 yuan. It was not until the afternoon that it was learned that the listed price of Textile Construction Company was the same as the previous period, with No. 100 and No. 120 Youguang at 2.8 million yuan, semi-gloss at 2.56 million yuan, and 75 semi-gloss at 2.35 million yuan. As a result, the mood gradually softened, and the final bid was 350,000 yuan, but very few transactions were made. Factory-run transactions were also rare, and the price floor felt solid. The morning was slightly softer, and the prices of various grades of goods were 50,000 to 100,000 yuan higher than on Wednesday. Silk goods were firm, but there were more transactions for quilt covers, and the price was 100,000 yuan higher. HUA brand opened at 3.4 million yuan for the best quality and 3.2 million yuan for the second best in the morning. In the afternoon, rayon prices weakened, and bids were also slightly smaller.</p>
<h3>Bearish Sentiment in the Bond Market</h3>
<p>Government bonds were subject to heavy selling in the counter market yesterday, and even with financial buyers absorbing miscellaneous bonds, prices fell across the board. Unified Class C opened at 2,230 yuan, and was immediately surrounded by sellers, falling from 2,250 yuan, approaching the 2,000 yuan mark at one point. It finally hovered around 2,050, down 290 yuan from the close before the holiday. Class A, B, and D each fell 220 yuan, and Unified Class E fell 240 yuan. The trading volume was approximately 5 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Good News for the Common People: Beans, Rice, and Oil All Decline</h3>
<p>The rice market had abundant supply, with 13,000 to 14,000 shi arriving in the north and south markets. The market was extremely sluggish. Xian rice continued to fall sharply by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, and medium and low-grade Jing rice also fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. However, high-grade white rice was scarce and remained firm, and Yin rice was firm. Crude oil from Qingdao was connected, falling by more than 1,000 yuan. Soybean oil and rapeseed oil were balanced between arrival and sales. The factory supply was slightly available, and the market was stable. Northeastern soybeans were still available, and miscellaneous grains from Hankou continued to arrive, but could not be digested outside the port, falling by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Mung beans arrived from all directions. The medium and low grades had no buyers, and sporadic transactions were made for high-grade goods, with prices high and the low grades sluggish. Red sorghum weakened by 300 to 500 yuan, and yellow sorghum fell by another 1,000 yuan at Customs, but raw peanut shops took the opportunity to purchase them. High-grade goods weakened and then rebounded, rising by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, medium-grade goods rising by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and low-grade goods were sluggish.</p>

<h3>Central Bank Provides as Much as Possible; Gold Price Pressed Down to 70,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Fresh gold continued to weaken, and customer sales were unusually strong. The Central Bank was once again mired in a hard fight. The opening price in the morning was 2.24 million, with buyers from Fujian and Shantou absorbing it constantly. In addition, retail investors were confused by rumors and the buying sentiment was strong. Thereafter, it rose, but there was quite a struggle outside 2.27 million. The high price once reached 2.285 million. After 10:00, the situation fluctuated again. The Central Bank continued to supply gold and allocated 50 taels at a price of 2.27 million. Later, customer sales stagnated, and many longs were worried and actively closed positions. The Central Bank took the opportunity to enter the market and broke through the 2.2 million mark, falling to 2.18 million. The selling sentiment only stabilized after this. At noon, it rebounded to around 2.22 million. In the afternoon, insiders sold urgently, and the spot price fell again. At the same time, it was announced that allocations would continue at a price of 2.15 million, falling to 2.14 million. Over-the-counter trading stabilized slightly, rising to 2.16 million.

<h3>De-stocking of Old Tea Still Good</h3>
<p>English firms have quite a demand for high-grade old tea, especially the 1945 Chen Qimen tea. Although Zhenhe Tea Shop is selling a considerable amount, it is still not enough to allocate. As for other varieties, the transaction volume is not as active as before because the inventory is not sufficient. As for the domestic sales of red-edged tea, the shops and customers in this street are still sluggish, but the Qimen floral fragrance from the local tea factories is selling exceptionally well, and the price has repeatedly hit new highs.</p>

<h3>Applications for Transporting Yarn and Cloth to Southern China Commence; Textile Management Committee to Dispatch Personnel to Fujian, Guangdong, Shantou, and Xiamen</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Following the announcement of the Provisional Management Regulations for Transporting Yarn and Cloth to Southern China and the Detailed Rules for Application and Review by the Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the committee began accepting registration applications from yarn and cloth manufacturers yesterday. Yesterday morning, a large number of manufacturers went to collect registration forms, with 97 trading companies and 58 production companies. Afternoon figures were not yet available. According to Mr. Liu Wenteng, Director of the Business Department of the committee, the committee will strictly review the registration applications of manufacturers and the quantity of fabric each company applies to transport to the south. Even the Unified Construction Company must register and apply without exception. The amount of cotton yarn to be transported south has already been allocated and finalized, so the process is simple and will be reviewed as applications are received. The issue of transporting cotton cloth to the south is more complex and may be reviewed centrally once every half month. During the review, the total amount of 75,000 bolts to be transported south will be used, with reference to the quantity of cloth transported to the four ports of Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, and Guangzhou in 1936 and 1937, to determine the percentage to be transported to each port. If the quantity of cloth applied for transport to the south is within this percentage, it will be approved as much as possible. If it exceeds the percentage, it will be reduced. The allocation of quantities among manufacturers will be based on their capital and sales volume. Mr. Liu strongly urged weaving factories to register as soon as possible to determine the allocated quantity. It was also reported that the Textile Management Committee will soon dispatch four specialists to be stationed in Shenzhen, Xiamen, Shantou, and Guangzhou to supervise the yarn and cloth transported to the south. Each specialist will discuss with the local Chamber of Commerce and relevant trade associations to determine a reasonable price for the yarn and cloth transported to the south. They will also supervise local manufacturers and users to ensure they have the priority right to purchase. After the yarn and cloth transported to the south arrives at its destination, the local consignee must fill out a form detailing the sales of the yarn and cloth transported to the south and submit it to the specialist of the Textile Management Committee for verification to prevent malpractices.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Decline Slightly</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks also weakened yesterday, following the general trend, with no new buying activity.

The final rates for Ewo Cotton Mill, Union Insurance, and Wheelock all fell by about half a percent compared to before the market closure. Other stocks also experienced slight declines.</p>
<h3>Popular Stocks All Decline; Trading Volume of Chinese Stocks Decreases</h3>
<p>Yesterday, major players in Chinese stocks remained inactive, and the enthusiastic retail investors were once again plunged into misery. Prices initially rose but then fell. Credit conditions initially eased, and the market opened higher, but this was short-lived. Prices soon turned from firm to flat, but retail investors still bought on the cheap, leading to a tortuous decline. The market was calm, and after 11:00 am, it became sluggish. However, there was a brief recovery at 11:30 am with some buying from northern interests. Wing On Company briefly rose from within the 800 yuan level to outside it, showing a short period of stability, but buying interest did not last, and it fell back within the level. As a result, the overall trend was downwards, and retail investors panicked. Off-market supply continued to appear, and without support, prices fell to low levels near noon. Compared to before the market closure, Wing On Company, Mayar Silk, Jingfu Weaving, Xinguang Company, Qin Xing Company, and Xin Xin Company each fell by 0.2 to 0.3. Among the less popular stocks, China Silk Corporation alone rose by slightly less than half a percent. Datong and Lian An rose slightly, Rong Feng rose by 0.6, Five Harmony Cement and Jing Lun were flat, and the rest all declined slightly. The total trading volume was 9.19 million shares, and off-market stocks also mostly declined.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Rises by More Than 100,000 Yuan; Allotment Prices Unchanged, Cotton Cloth Shows a Consolidating Trend</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The situation for yarn and cloth is firm. Although sales from Guangdong merchants are small, purchases from the Yangtze River region and northern areas continue. Local factories also make small additions from time to time, and prices are rising. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was trading at 3.48 million yuan, and 20-count Double Horse yarn was trading at 2.21 million yuan. Some were buying unweighed yarn, trading at 2.32 million yuan. The former rose by more than 100,000 yuan, and the latter also rose slightly.</p>
<p>The allotment price of yarn by the Unified Construction Company remains the same. The allottees for 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn are dyeing and weaving canvas associations, 32-count Blue Phoenix yarn is for knitted handmade underwear, 32-count Silver Moon yarn is for dyeing and weaving underwear, and 42-count Sunlight yarn is for knitting, etc., with a total of 898.5 pieces sold. The allotment price for 20-count yarn remains 1.55 million yuan, and other counts are proportionally increased.</p>

Later, due to weak trading, prices showed a slight pullback.</p>
<h3>Tax on Raw Materials and Finished Products; Hat Industry Expresses Dissatisfaction</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Chamber of Commerce has reported four difficulties presented by the local grass and felt hat industry associations and requested the authorities to exempt the hat industry from commodity tax. A telegram has been sent to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, stating: "Commodity tax is based on the previous consolidated tax. Traditionally, after one tax is paid, no further taxes are levied. For example, after commodity tax is paid on cotton yarn, the cloth woven from the yarn and the shoes, hats, and clothing made from the cloth are not subject to further commodity tax. Now that commodity tax has been paid on the wool yarn produced by wool spinning mills, the felt hats made from wool raw materials are still subject to double taxation. According to the yarn tax ratio, this is clearly unfair. Since fur and leather are both within the scope of the commodity tax law, there should not be unique and trivial differences in the measures. We request the esteemed Yuan and Ministry to review and exempt the tax."</p>
<h3>Securities Exchange to Add After-Hours Trading, Starting from the 16th</h3>

<h3>National Political Council Organizes School Donation and Birthday Celebration</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Education Requests Additional Reconstruction Funds; Executive Yuan Allocates 10 Billion First, Less Than One-Tenth of the Requested Amount; Plans to Borrow from the Four Joint Banks</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] Since the prices of train, ship, and plane tickets have risen sharply, and the prices of various commodities have soared, the original budget for the complete reconstruction of schools and educational institutions in the rear area is insufficient to cover actual expenses. The difference is very large. The directly subordinate schools have repeatedly requested additional budget allocations. After careful review and overall planning, and in accordance with the central government's regulations that local general administrative expenses should not exceed two to four times the original amount, the lowest standard of two times was used to compile the request for an additional 120 billion yuan in education reconstruction funds from the central government (the original reconstruction funds approved by the central government were 60 billion yuan, and this request is for double that amount, totaling 120 billion). This is still under review by the Executive Yuan. Initially, the schools and educational institutions in the rear area were unable to allocate a large number of travel berths due to transportation difficulties. Due to the circumstances, they had to reconstruct as early as possible, enroll students during the summer vacation, and start classes after the summer. Some chartered ships or traveled by land, taking detours. In addition, various ticket prices increased sharply, and travel accommodation expenses increased with commodity prices. Transferring ships at major stations, waiting for trains, and delaying days exceeded the initial ideal cost significantly. In addition to the higher travel expenses, the expenses for school office and teaching, student accommodation equipment, and construction also increased many times over, requiring additional funding to supplement actual expenses. Now, commodity prices are constantly fluctuating, and the later reconstruction travel, school equipment, and construction are carried out, the greater the expenses will be. The adjustments to the salaries of civil servants and teachers are clear evidence of this. The schools that are already undergoing reconstruction or urgently need to reconstruct have repeatedly requested the Ministry of Education to allocate additional funds to avoid delays and further impacts from commodity price fluctuations. The Ministry of Education has repeatedly petitioned the central government based on the situation. Recently, it was heard that the Executive Yuan has decided to allocate 10 billion yuan first to meet current urgent needs. The entire request of 120 billion yuan is still under review. The Ministry of Education plans to receive the 10 billion yuan from the central government next week and then comprehensively review the urgent financial needs of each school (to date, the total amount of temporary borrowing requested by the schools due to urgent needs, before the central government approved the 120 billion, has reached 30 billion yuan. The Ministry of Education is overwhelmed with the requests from various schools for borrowing funds and finds it difficult to cope. It can only try to make do with what is available, feeling the pain of too many monks and too little gruel). It will first allocate a portion of the funds to meet the urgent needs of each school. Before the central government decides to temporarily allocate 10 billion yuan, the Ministry of Education had been in contact with the Four Joint Banks for borrowing funds for the schools. The banks agreed to lend 3 billion yuan. The Ministry of Education stated that according to the original request from the schools, the Ministry of Education would provide a guarantee, and the schools would borrow from the Four Banks. The Four Banks suggested that the Ministry of Education borrow directly and repay it when the additional reconstruction funds are allocated. Therefore, the procedures have not yet been finalized. Now, although the central government has allocated 10 billion yuan first, which is less than one-tenth of the requested amount (the requested amount is 120 billion), borrowing is still necessary. However, the borrowing procedures from the Four Banks are more complicated, and the time to cash out is longer.</p>

<h3>New Look of the Shanghai Book Industry; Commercial Press and Others Show Vigorous Atmosphere; Zhengzhong is Relatively Planned and Hopeful</h3>
<p>The Shanghai book industry is the hub of the national publishing industry and is closely related to cultural construction. Recently, it has shown a vigorous atmosphere. For example, the position of General Manager of the Commercial Press has been taken over by Zhu Jingnong, Vice Minister of Education. Zhu has resigned from the position of Vice Minister of Education and come to Shanghai to take office, which is bound to bring about a boost.</p>
<p>Personnel Renewal, Optimistic Prospects</p>
<p>Gu Shusen, Director of the National Education Department of the Ministry of Education, has also resigned from the Ministry and come to Shanghai to take up the position of Deputy General Manager of the Zhonghua Book Company, assisting General Manager Li Shuming in managing everything. The prospects are naturally more optimistic. Chen Heqin, a famous children's educator, has recently been hired by the Children's Book Bureau as the chief editor of the bureau and the chief editor of the "Children's Knowledge" Pictorial and the "Children's Story" Monthly. There will be a new performance of children's books. The World Book Bureau has also been actively promoting its business recently. Li Shihui, the chairman of the bureau, is doing his best to preside over the editing work. During his trip to Peiping, he gave oral introductions to the "World Encyclopedia" published by the bureau from time to time, which was well received by all walks of life. Since Tao Baichuan took over as General Manager of the Datong Book Company, internal reforms have been carried out, and the business has been booming. The future is unlimited.</p>
<p>Far-Sighted and Unique</p>
<p>Since Zhang Xichen left Shanghai and Xia Qiaozun passed away, the Kaiming Bookstore has been managed by General Manager Fan Xiren, maintaining its inherent reputation and publishing famous new and old books. Although there are few personnel changes in the Zhengzhong Book Company, the person in charge, Ye Suzhong, is far-sighted and able to carefully handle the headquarters and branch offices, and the business is developing on average. It is the most planned and hopeful among its peers. The Life Bookstore has formed a new literary center, and General Manager Xu Boxin constantly exerts new strength in this area. The Guangming Bookstore, which is operated exclusively by Wang Zhicheng, has always been famous for its new literature and has recently compiled and printed children's books, creating a unique style.</p>
<p>A Different Army Rises, Adding Color</p>
<p>The Longmen Bookstore, which has always been known for printing Western books, has recently recruited famous university professors to start compiling new English books. The Yongxiang Printing House, which has been dedicated to literary periodicals in recent years, has recently recruited famous writers to strengthen its lineup. Other examples include the China Cultural Service Agency, the Wentong Bookstore, the Independent Publishing House, the Writer's Bookstore, the Victory Publishing House, and the Great China Book Bureau, which have moved from Chongqing to Shanghai since the victory. These are all rising as a different army, adding a lot of color to the book industry.</p>
<h3>First Allocation of Education Loan Funds; Each Student Receives Only 20,000</h3>
<p>After the list of students approved for education loans was successively announced by the Municipal Education Loan Fund Committee, there were already 4,383 people. The last batch of lists of service students and martyrs' comrades will also be announced today and tomorrow. It is heard that the service standard this time, in addition to being based on the provisions of the committee's second notice, will also include students who have participated in the National Goods Market service and have performed well. It is estimated that 112 people have been approved for full tuition fees (including 51 children of martyrs' comrades from poor families), and 298 people have been approved for half tuition fees. However, the total income from loan funds this time is far from ideal. As of the end of September, it is estimated to be over 130 million yuan. Over 33% of this will be allocated to the children of anti-Japanese martyrs and comrades and to students who have performed well in service. The remaining amount will be distributed equally among all approved students. Therefore, the first allocation will only be 20,000 yuan per student. In addition, the review work of Aurora University will be the responsibility of the university president and student organizations. According to the service reward measures of the Education Loan Fund Committee, the university may separately receive over 10 million yuan. After the list is transferred from the university to the Education Loan Fund Committee, it will be announced at the same time as the list of Ta Kung Pao sales students.</p>
<h3>Physical Education Representatives from Colleges and Universities in the City to Hold Meeting Today to Discuss Various Sports Competitions This Year</h3>
<p>The Shanghai College and University Federation, in order to promote inter-school sports competitions, resolved at the fourth representative meeting of various schools last month to establish a standing committee for this year's sports competitions. The committee publicly elected five schools as members: Jiaotong University, Jinan University, St. John's University, Aurora University, and the Municipal Sports College. The committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting at 10:00 am today (the 12th) in the East Hall on the 9th floor of the Ba Xian Qiao YMCA to discuss the progress of the competition. At 12:00 pm on the same day, a meeting of physical education representatives from all colleges and universities in the city (37 schools) will be held, followed by a dinner, to discuss the progress of the event and strive for satisfactory results. It is hoped that representatives from all schools will attend on time, and sports reporters from various newspapers are welcome to attend.</p>
<h3>Screening of Students Promoted from Puppet Schools; Jiangsu Province Extends Deadline for Another Month</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang] In order to facilitate students promoted from puppet schools in Jiangsu Province to obtain academic records, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education specially formulated screening remedial measures, originally limited to the end of September. The department has now agreed to extend the deadline for another month at the request of students from various schools. All students who have been promoted to colleges and universities can still apply for screening from the department before the end of October in accordance with the original regulations.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Plans to Organize a Private School Registration Review Committee</h3>
<p>There are more than 800 private primary and secondary schools in this city, with primary schools accounting for 615. Only one-tenth of them have been registered. For the remaining unregistered schools, the Education Bureau ordered them to register last month, but stipulated that the school fund should be 10 million yuan for primary schools, 20 million yuan for junior high schools, and 30 million yuan for senior high schools. This fund is used to expand the school. In fact, most private schools are currently short of funds and have no plan to prepare 10 million yuan. Therefore, they have all requested the Education Bureau to reduce the amount appropriately. The Education Bureau is now organizing a private school registration review committee. Each school can first apply for registration and declare the amount of funds that can be raised. The committee will then base its decision on whether the primary school has not reached six classes or the secondary school has not fully opened each grade, and will also consider the school's performance, history, and other circumstances to determine the amount to be eliminated appropriately.</p>
<h3>Municipal Middle School Friendship Association Advocates Continued Collection of Teacher Respect Money This Term</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Middle School Teachers and Staff Friendship Association, regarding the matter of teacher respect money, the board of directors decided to advocate that the collection should continue as originally planned this semester, and seek remedies for the next semester. Regarding the resolution to improve teachers' treatment, it is advocated to request the government to make practical expressions when re-compiling the budget.</p>
<h3>Football League Opening Postponed; Rescheduled to Start on the 26th; Italian Overseas Chinese Team Allowed to Restore Membership; Farewell Match Against Mixed Team on the 20th</h3>

<p>(1) To review 52 new member teams initially selected, including the Railway Youyou team, and make a final decision after the staff registration procedures are completed. (2) Since most of the new and old member teams have not submitted the list of players, it is impossible to arrange the groups.

Those who fail to do so will be regarded as not participating and will not be accommodated. (3) The league has been postponed to start on October 26 due to insufficient preparation.

<h3>Setback for the Expeditionary Wheel: An Unfavorable Start, Defeated at Renyu</h3>
<p>The Luoyang Army Transport Sixth Regiment's expeditionary wheel basketball team has been in Shanghai for several days. Last night at 7:00 PM, they had their first match against the Renyu team at the city gymnasium. The audience was quite enthusiastic and the atmosphere was lively. Unfortunately, due to unfamiliarity with the venue, the expeditionary wheel team had an unfavorable start and was defeated by Renyu with a score of 33 to 37. In the first half, Renyu took the lead with a score of 24 to 17.</p>
<p>Unfamiliarity with the Venue Hinders Combat</p>
<p>Overall, the expeditionary wheel team has excellent physique and strength. Their tactics have certainly been guided. As for an inland team, it is already quite commendable. However, their coordination is still lacking in proficiency and their methods could be improved. Given time, they will surely be impressive. According to the team leader, Wu Zhuoming, who told reporters that this was the team's first time playing indoors under electric lights, and they had never used fan-shaped standard backboards, so their shooting would naturally be affected.</p>
<p>Renyu Takes an Early Lead</p>
<p>The referees were Liu Hesheng and Wu Zibin. The expeditionary wheel team consisted of Wei Lingxiao, Cai Zhongqiang, Tu Wenlong, Yu Ruizhang, and Wang Binghuan. Renyu fielded Wang Huaiting, Yao Wenyi, Shen Pengju, Wu Xinshu, and Sun Guozheng. The expeditionary wheel team showed their strength early on, with Yu Ruizhang scoring three points in a row. Renyu's Shen Pengju scored a point from a free throw. After that, Renyu sailed smoothly, with Wang Huaiting and Shen Pengju scoring repeatedly. After a score of 9 to 4, the expeditionary wheel's Gong Binghuan and Yu Ruizhang each scored a basket, reducing the score to 8 to 9, and then 15 to 11. Renyu's Liang Yongjia replaced Sun Guozheng. The expeditionary wheel team called a timeout, which proved to be a turning point, bringing the score to 17 to 19, only two points behind. However, Renyu scored again, ending the first half with Renyu leading 24 to 17.</p>
<p>Expeditionary Wheel Exceeds for the Second Time</p>
<p>After the break, the armies engaged in battle. The expeditionary wheel's Tu Wenlong scored first, followed by Yu Ruitong's contribution, gaining momentum. Renyu replaced Wang Zhisheng with Chen WeiYuan, but the expeditionary wheel's Tu scored again, putting the expeditionary wheel team ahead 25 to 24. The audience applauded. Renyu's Yao Wenyi scored a free throw, tying the score at 25 each. Tu scored again with a miraculous shot, putting the expeditionary wheel team ahead again, but they failed to maintain their advantage, and Renyu scored ten points in one go. Renyu then led by a large margin of 35 to 27. The expeditionary wheel's Cai, Yu, and Tu each scored a basket, bringing the score closer again, to 33 to 35. Renyu called five timeouts. Shen Pengju hit the target. At this time, Zhang Lingxiao was disqualified for his fifth foul. When Liu Zhengjun came on the field, the expeditionary wheel team missed two certain shots, otherwise they could have tied the score. Before long, the game ended, with a final score of 33 to 37.</p>

<h3>Cooperation of Autonomous Personnel to Handle Land Tax Clearance</h3>
<p>The Civil Affairs Department approved the document sent by the Municipal Finance Bureau regarding the cooperation between the Land Tax Work Team and Baojia personnel. The method is that specialized personnel are hired to go to the countryside, divided into small teams, divided by autonomous regions, to register the area and tax amount of each district, and to formulate the rules for clearing land registration and collecting land tax, as well as the temporary rules for the assessment and rewards for grassroots personnel handling land tax. The so-called grassroots personnel in the above temporary rules are said to refer to the Land Tax Work Team sent to the countryside by the Finance Bureau, as well as the personnel of the local District Office, Baojia, and various collection offices who are responsible for land tax work.</p>

<h3>Straight to San Francisco: Aboard the "Meiqi General" Ship on the 10th</h3>
<p>— San Francisco Airmail, September 16th, Zhu Haitao</p>
<p>Thinking back to the efforts made in the past two months to go abroad, and thinking of the turbulent life of the past nine years, the War of Resistance delayed my trip abroad by eight years. I feel that today's departure is almost like a long dream. However, fortunately, my ten-year wish has finally come true, and I am counting myself so happily.</p>
<h3>Procedures for Studying in the United States: Passing Eight Barriers and Breaking Through the Encirclement</h3>
<p>Speaking of studying abroad, it is truly diverse and full of surprises. Because there was a period when the government's regulations were very strict, and people were not allowed to go out without passing the Ministry of Education's examination. However, the Ministry of Education did not hold examinations for several years. As a result, a group of people close to the water tower each showed their magical powers to cross the sea like immortals. Some followed important figures going abroad as nominal attendants, some requested a special referral from the Chairman, some impersonated the wives of diplomats, and some served as attendants to patients going abroad for treatment. There was a period when anyone invited by foreign countries to lecture could go out, so all the petitioners became internationally renowned scholars for a while. There was a period when newspapers could send foreign correspondents, so those who went abroad were all uncrowned kings of the press. Even today, many students on board still hold passports for business, missionary work, overseas Chinese... some inexplicable purposes. I can tell you: every student on this ship has experienced struggles lasting from several months to several years, passing five passes and slaying six generals, breaking through the encirclement.</p>
<p>According to the current regulations of the Ministry of Education: (referring to the summer of 1946) As long as one graduates from a national or registered school, has worked for five years, and has obtained a scholarship from a foreign university, one can apply for a study abroad certificate. Or, one can obtain a study abroad certificate by passing the study abroad examination. These are two legitimate paths. However, it is not easy to obtain a foreign scholarship, and the study abroad examination is not held frequently. Therefore, various alternative methods arise. The above is only a part of it. Because of these alternative methods, both public and private sectors have increased a lot of trouble. The Vice Minister of the Ministry of Education suffers from this every day, and even the Chairman cannot avoid paying attention to it. This is very uneconomical in terms of administrative efficiency. However, in any case, if you really want to study abroad, you must obtain a letter of admission from a foreign university. This is the first hurdle. This hurdle can take up to a year, and as little as a month.</p>
<p>After obtaining the letter of admission, submit it to the Ministry of Education for approval to study abroad. On average, this takes about two to three months. This is the second hurdle.</p>
<p>With the Ministry of Education's approval to study abroad (or the Ministry of Economic Affairs' approval to do business), apply for a passport from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. You need to submit three photos and a passport fee of 5,005 yuan. You also need a local reliable shop to guarantee the source of income for the person going abroad and guarantee that the person going abroad will not harm national interests. (Those dispatched by the government can be guaranteed by the dispatching agency.) After going through the guarantee procedures, if all goes well, you can expect results in about a week after submitting it to the passport section of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The passport is a very exquisite thick booklet with a blue cloth cover, stating the name, age, occupation, etc. The validity period for ordinary study abroad is three years. This is the third hurdle.</p>
<p>At the same time, you have to go to the Central Hospital or obtain a physical examination certificate from the American Consulate (C119 form), and go to the doctor designated by the American side for a physical examination, including X-ray fluoroscopy, etc., to ensure that there is no trachoma, tuberculosis, or other diseases. This examination is quite troublesome and often cannot be completed in one day. If the urine and stool samples are readily available, you can see the results the next day. This is the fourth hurdle. This hurdle also requires a photo to prove that it is you.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the physical examination time, start getting vaccinated, including one vaccination for smallpox, three injections each for cholera and typhoid fever, and one injection each for epidemic typhus and plague. Fill in each item on the "Vaccination Certificate" from the port quarantine office. This book also looks like a booklet, called the "Yellow Book," and is submitted to the customs quarantine office for inspection along with the physical examination certificate. This is the fifth hurdle, which usually takes two to three weeks.</p>
<p>After obtaining the passport, use the passport to apply for foreign exchange from the foreign exchange department of the Bank of China. You need to fill out two application forms. Ordinary students can only apply for $500 in travel expenses and $900 for half a year's expenses, totaling $1,400, but it is often possible to find ways to apply for more. The application form is transferred by the Bank of China to the Foreign Exchange Department of the Central Bank for approval, which is expected to take about four or five days to complete. In addition to the official price, the exchange also requires a handling fee based on the market price of the day, which is 30 to 50 yuan in legal tender per US dollar. This is the sixth hurdle.</p>
<p>Passport, letter of admission, physical examination certificate (filled out by the doctor, sealed, specifically for the US Consulate), Yellow Book, foreign exchange check or money order in your name (the amount varies depending on the nature of the trip; $1,400 is enough for study abroad), and the shipping company's ship reservation, once these are all complete, you can go to the American Consulate at 408 Fuzhou Road, Construction Building, Shanghai to request a visa. This is also a major hurdle. Every day, the house is crowded with countless Chinese and foreigners. After registering, wait for a letter to schedule a time to meet with a Chinese man, Mr. Peter Loh, and then you are likely to be successful. Mr. Loh is a man with a serious face and is extremely busy. He will check all the documents and ask you many questions, from birth to the present, and from the present to the future. It is best to tell the truth, even if you are a young lady, there is no need to hide your age. He will take out a large pile of forms and type your words one by one. He will have an employee hold your left and right hands and print thirty or forty fingerprints and handprints one by one. The one that is printed the most is the right index finger, because it is the one that is most likely to commit a crime. After everything is filled out, you have to sign more than a dozen words to acknowledge responsibility. Pay four photos and ten US dollars (note that it must be US dollars, not legal tender. Fortunately, there are many black market stalls selling change near Sichuan Road and Jiujiang Road, and you can easily buy ten dollars, but be careful not to buy fakes). Then take this pile of forms into the inner room to see a female vice consul. She will ask you, are all the things filled in on these forms true? If it is true, please raise your right hand. When you raise your right hand, you have taken an oath, and she will sign your documents, and you take them out to see Mr. Loh again. He will pick out what you need to bring and tell you to go back, and then this hurdle is over. This hurdle can be passed very quickly, or it may never be passed. This is the seventh hurdle.</p>
<p>The last hurdle, but not necessarily the simplest one, is buying tickets from the shipping company. Usually it is at the Grand Line Company (The Preiat Line) near the Bund on Guangdong Road. Due to the crowded ship positions during the war, it is best to book the ship position a few months in advance, regardless of how the other hurdles are progressing. By the time you have passed each hurdle, this hurdle will have almost arrived. Otherwise, it is not worth waiting for two or three months just for the ticket. This is the eighth hurdle.</p>
<p>The shipping company has detailed regulations regarding everything on board, so there is no need to mention them in detail here. However, a few points are worth noting: (1) Before boarding, it is best to buy a foldable canvas deck chair, because the ships equipped during the war do not provide chairs, and it is much more comfortable to have this chair. (2) Bring enough clothes, because it is quite cold on the northern route. (3) Guard against thieves, because if you lose your passport, all previous efforts will be wasted.</p>
<h3>The Shipboard Talent Is Extremely Flourishing For a Time</h3>
<p>The "General M. C. Meigs" (S.S. General M.C. Meigs) weighs 22,000 tons, is 622 feet long, has a draft of 30 feet, and six decks. It was launched on March 12, 1944. The ship is operated by the American Dollar Steamship Company. It was originally a wartime transport ship. The new ship had its cannons removed, but the internal structure has not been greatly changed. There are two types of cabins: one is called Officer's Cabin, each room accommodating from six to twenty-four people. The other is called Emergency Closs, each room accommodating from one to two hundred people. Officer's cabins have two or three-tier beds, with tables and chairs, a lounge, a large dining room, and a private deck. Emergency cabins have no tables or chairs, with beds stacked four tiers high, each tier about a foot apart. One can lie down sideways but cannot sit up. It was originally used for transporting soldiers during the war. All utensils on the ship are stamped with "Property of the U.S. Government," and some are carved or woven with the letters U.S.A. (United States Navy). On the day of boarding, a notice is posted: all items on the ship are the property of the U.S. government, and anyone who steals will be fined up to 10,000 yuan or imprisoned for up to one year. Officers eat in two shifts; emergency cabin passengers line up and wait their turn to enter the dining hall. The hall has several large pots. The queue proceeds in order, and each person takes a knife, fork, spoon, and alloy plate. The plate is divided into six sections, and one dish is placed in each section after passing a pot. The dishes are generally the same for each meal, mostly oatmeal porridge or tapioca porridge, eggs, bread, desserts, and coffee for breakfast. Lunch and dinner are beef, potatoes, rice or noodles, beans, bread, cabbage, pumpkin, fruit, desserts, and coffee. After quickly finishing the meal, one takes the plate to another place and throws the uneaten and leftover food into the trash can. The plate, knife, fork, spoon, and cup are returned to the staff inside the counter. Withdrawing, the meal is over. For drinking, there are six large buckets in the dining hall filled with hot water, but most people drink cold water from the fountains in each cabin.</p>
<p>Inside the "Emergency Cabin," each bed has a thick mattress, white sheets, pillowcases, and large towels, all of which are very clean. They are changed once or twice a week. Next to the cabin is the washroom, which also serves as a shower room. The room has salt water and unfiltered fresh water for washing. One must also wash one's own clothes. The adjacent room is the toilet, with an unlimited supply of toilet paper.</p>
<p>The ship provides free matches, stationery, and envelopes. There is also a retail store selling chocolate, biscuits, peanuts, cigarettes, face powder... and so on. The entire ship is kept clean, except for the cabins, which are dirtier and more cluttered due to too many passengers. On the ship, I only found one fly and never saw lice, mosquitoes, fleas, or bedbugs. It is said that someone found a rat, but it could not be confirmed. Large iron buckets are placed throughout the ship, and waste paper and fruit peels are placed inside and thrown into the sea on time.</p>
<p>It is said that since a passenger ship sailed on July 4th, the "General M. C. Meigs" is the first to sail to the United States, and after this ship sailed, there was no ship again until October 12th. (Note: that is Marine Lynx, I saw this ship docked in San Francisco yesterday, frozen by the American sailors' strike. If so, then there must have been a ship on October 12th). So all the students rushing to school tried their best to catch this ship. Coupled with the inspection members sent by the government and the well-known professors invited by the United States, the people on this ship were extremely flourishing for a time. Therefore, some people say that there has never been a ship in history that has carried so many Chinese people to San Francisco. This may be an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Dai Ailian Performs Dance, Her Whole Body Shows Rhythm The ship left Shanghai's Gonghexing Wharf at 4 PM on September 3rd, 1946. Although the wartime was difficult, and there were no colorful streamers connecting the ship and the shore, thousands of people on the shore braved the hot sun, waving handkerchiefs, fans, and straw hats. Their enthusiasm was very palpable. Especially because there were a large number of Jewish refugees on board, hundreds of Jewish compatriots lined up on the pier, singing songs, and walking forward with the ship, until they reached the end of the pier, still waving their scarves and throwing their hats. Until the figures became small and the singing gradually faded, the eyes of the people on the ship were red, and several ladies could not help crying out loud. This made me, who is used to going out, can't help but smile secretly, but I can't help but sympathize.</p>
<p>After the ship sailed for two days, it passed Japan and gradually headed north. The wind and waves gradually increased, and the weather gradually became colder. The number of people on the deck also decreased. By the afternoon of the Mid-Autumn Festival, there were only a few people left. This situation changed in the days near San Francisco, because the voyage turned south, the weather was better, and it became lively again. It was so lively that even folk dances were performed. Dai Aiyun demonstrated a dance with rhythm throughout her body.</p>
<p>Originally, this ship was sailing directly from Shanghai to San Francisco, without stopping at even a small island along the way. People were bored enough for more than ten consecutive days without landing. I, ashamed, besides lying in bed sleeping all day and all night, often went to the deck to watch the sea when I got up.</p>
<p>General Feng's Heroic Demeanor Is As Before, Talking! "Altruism"</p>
<p>Many people bought photos of the "General M. C. Meigs" and asked others to sign them, probably cherishing the abundance of talent on this ship. Of course, when mentioning people, we cannot fail to mention General Feng Yuxiang, who recently retired and was sent abroad to inspect water conservancy, preparing to harness the Yellow River for China. General Feng's tall stature and loud voice are familiar to everyone. Now, at the age of sixty-plus, he inevitably has white hair. Sometimes he also gets seasick. Occasionally, he can be seen wrapped in a heavy coat and lying on a deck chair, with his wife sitting beside him, seeming a little old. But at other times, he can be seen striding vigorously on the deck in the cold wind, his heroic demeanor as before. At the founding meeting of the Chinese Friendship Association, he loudly said: "Many old friends asked me, when we arrive in a foreign country, how should we answer when people ask about our domestic affairs? I said: The biggest thing in China is resisting Japan. Now that such a big problem has been solved, what other problems cannot be solved? The War of Resistance is the credit of the people of the whole country, but the leadership of Chairman Chiang and the Kuomintang is also an iron fact. A dragon cannot move without a head. The contributions of Chairman Chiang and the Kuomintang cannot be denied. Naturally, we cannot be satisfied with the current situation. Many people say: How can there be so much corruption? But how can we say that everyone in a government, from top to bottom, is good? Chairman Chiang sent people to take over, but he didn't say: You can take whatever you think is good! We read the newspapers every day, and there are officials who are shot. China is so big, and the population is so large. It is because there are too many problems."</p>
<p>General Feng told me: His inspection period will be more than a year. He will not only see the United States but also Europe. He is currently writing inspection diaries for the Ta Kung Pao and the Peace Daily, so he and the reporter are in the same profession.</p>
<p>Regarding the opinions on water conservancy, Mr. Zhang Yuanxi, a water conservancy expert who accompanied him, advocates that after he returns, he should not do large projects that take ten or twenty years (like Y.V.A.). He can first do a small-scale water conservancy project that can be completed in two or three years, using a small amount of power to promote a small amount of industry, and using a small amount of industry to cultivate a larger water conservancy project, and then to promote a larger amount of industry. Proceeding step by step can be practical and effective. Otherwise, being fond of grandiose achievements will lead to nothing. I think General Feng, who is committed to practice, will agree with this opinion. At least, Mrs. Feng has already agreed.</p>
<p>Old Professor with Flowing Beard Goes Abroad to Lecture and Seek Information</p>
<p>Another Mr. Feng is Professor Feng Youlan, a great contemporary philosopher. In plain clothes, sandwiched in the student crowd, sleeping in "sandwiched bread beds," eating "standing in line for food," except for a cluster of fluttering beards, there is nothing different from us. He told me that he was invited by the University of Pennsylvania to lecture for a period of one year. He hopes to find some Chinese philosophy materials in the United States that China does not have.</p>
<p>Mr. Hua Luogeng is unfortunately a cripple, but his achievements in mathematics have already made him famous all over the world. This time, the United States was famous and hired him, so he went to the United States on the same ship as us after his trip to the Soviet Union, not hesitating to work hard. Mr. Feng Youlan wished him to have his leg cured in the United States. It is said that it is possible, and we also wish him the same.</p>
<p>Mr. Li Dongfang modestly calls himself a storyteller. He said that his purpose is to realize the task of popularizing history. He often chats with foreigners and explains China's weaknesses to foreigners. He believes that the current Kuomintang is suffering for the government that does not implement the Kuomintang's resolutions, so he advocates convening the National Assembly as soon as possible to return power to the people. When talking about the factional divisions in the Chinese history circle, he was very happy to talk about the achievements of the Chinese Historical Society. He advocated eliminating factions and working together.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Maozheng is a Sichuanese who is very good at rhetoric. He is good at both Chinese and English. He is now doing his best to promote the "World Citizen Movement," trying to eliminate the occurrence of the Third World War. This trip is his eighth around the world.</p>
<p>There are too many other well-known people to introduce one by one, and among them, the unknown next generation also has unlimited prospects.</p>

<h3>Bian Zheng Line News from Kaifeng on the 2nd</h3>
<p>On the Longhai Railway, if you want to be a passenger, you really need to have good patience. First of all, it is not easy to find out if there is a train. The trains on the Longhai Railway are "fishing for three days and drying nets for five days." There are news about the Longhai Railway in the newspaper every day, either there is no coal or there is a breakdown. If you want to take the train, you must first inquire about the news. It is not easy to hear real news. The people in the office, inquiry office, and station do not look good, and their voices are not pleasant, and they are very impatient. Even if there is a train, it is even more difficult for you to buy a ticket and get on the train. I admire your ability and luck very much. But, all in all, it's always better to have money.</p>
<p>The Longhai Railway is crying about coal every day, as if it can push away all responsibility. However, the most basic condition for a railway is to "have trains." What has the Longhai Railway achieved since it was fully taken over? Express trains, slow trains, mixed trains, it's always the same train. It's considered good if there are military trains. A person who loves the railway to the point of sacrificing his life told me that when the Eighth Bridge was bombed, he cried! He said that the Eighth Bridge would never be repaired as well as it used to be, and in the current situation, this bridge would not be repaired! Moreover, even if the wooden bridge is repaired, it will soon be damaged. In the rainy season, the Longhai Railway will be fragmented and get worse and worse, until it is no longer "through"! These words have all come true.</p>
<p>Fishing for Three Days and Drying Nets for Five Days Such is the Longhai Railway</p>
<h3>Old Cow and Broken Car Can Only Crawl, Can't Go Fast</h3>
<p>On the Longhai Railway, many passengers have already sacrificed their lives for it, which is inevitable. This time, at Jiaokou, four to five hundred travelers gave their lives as gifts again. Who can say that there are no geniuses and no cadres needed by the country among those who sacrificed here? A division commander's whole family died. He should have died for the country, but he died for the Longhai Railway! The Jiaokou tragedy only made the powerful railway police rich, and the coffin shops in the east and west of Jiaokou also became rich. Four to five hundred lives are now buried in the ground. The person in charge of the railway bureau said in the newspaper that he would ask the central government for punishment. Even the most incompetent child can calculate this account. How can one life be worth four to five hundred lives? Let us look at the result of this tragedy calmly! The government has come with the greatest determination to rectify discipline and benefit the people, and I don't think it will let this matter go lightly. It will not let the dead be wronged in the ground of Jiaokou!</p>
<p>From Kaifeng to Zhengzhou, there are only one hundred and forty miles. Do you know how many hours the Longhai Railway train takes? Twelve hours! The train does not go very fast. It "crawls." If you drop something under the train, you can jump down to pick it up and then climb back up without hurrying. The soldiers are all in airtight iron-skinned cars and boxcars. The ticket inspectors jump off the train and run to another train, and that's how they work safely.</p>
<p>The Longhai Railway has reached the point where it must be rectified! This train crawls like an ox cart. The "car" is a broken car, and the "ox" is an "old cow." This is the most accurate depiction of the Longhai Railway. How can a "broken car" be good? How can an "old cow" pull fast?</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>National Art and National Spirit</h3>
<p>— Xu Shiqi</p>
<p>The origins of the cultures of various countries in the world can be divided into two major systems. In the East, it originated from China and India, influenced Korea and Japan, and spread throughout the Asian continent. Western culture originated from Egypt and Greece, flowed into the Italian Peninsula, and influenced the whole of Europe and the United States. Due to differences in time, space, and natural environment, the national arts formed have their own special spirit and contributions.</p>
<p>A beautiful autumn begonia leaf has floated up and down in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea since ancient times. The middle pole of the petiole constitutes the Shandong Peninsula. The veins are divided into the three major basins of the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, and the Pearl River. The Altai Mountains, the Tianshan Mountains, and the Himalayas are its natural edges and barriers in the southwest and north. The climate combines the errors of temperate, tropical, and frigid zones. The humanistic qualities are fortitude and strength, and sincere and peaceful demeanor. It is a pity that this beautiful autumn begonia leaf has been favored by our neighbor Miss Fusang for a century. She considers it to be a fertile mulberry leaf. She colludes with invading partners to implement piecemeal annexation, spitting out a large pile of messy silk of "repaying grievances with kindness." At the same time, she forgets that the owner of this leaf has given her immense cultural grace and magnificent artistic contributions. The times are constantly advancing. Now, the autumn begonia leaf is not a mulberry leaf after all, but the neighbor who made a cocoon for herself has become a pitiful worm!</p>
<p>The inherent art of the Chinese nation has its own transcendent and independent spirit. The bronzes of the Shang and Zhou dynasties, the palace artifacts and stone carvings of the Han dynasty, the murals and sculptures, poems, music, and dances of the Tang and Five Dynasties, the realistic flower-and-bird paintings of the Song people, as well as landscapes and figures, are exquisite and magnificent. There is also a unique abstract art that transcends realization, which is not found in any other country in the world, and is a unique national art of China: calligraphy. The script can represent the changes of the times and the revelation of the writer's thoughts and personality. It is truly the treasure of the oriental art garden.</p>
<p>The azure sky of the East sets off the towering snow peaks of the Himalayas, making people feel infinite about this ancient country in the southern end of Asia with a 4,000-year cultural history. As early as the time of King Ling of Zhou, Sakyamuni, the founder of Buddhism, was born in Kapilavastu in northern India. With his superhuman wisdom and thought, and his compassionate heart, he created doctrines that influenced the broad, peaceful, and lofty philosophical thoughts of the entire Eastern nation. Therefore, solemn and magnificent architecture, sculptures, and paintings were produced in art. The grandeur of the temples has the structure of modern three-dimensional architecture. The composition and colors of the murals are simple and unadorned, containing the meaning of primitive art, and have a brand-new modern form. During the Han, Wei, and Six Dynasties of China, the exotic flowers and plants of Indian art that were imported opened up the southeast, northwest, and north of an autumn begonia leaf. The Datong Yungang, Luoyang Longmen, and Gansu Dunhuang remain great wonders of Buddhist art that are immortal.</p>
<p>What is the oldest building left to date in human history? I'm afraid it is the Egyptian Pyramid. This ancient civilization, which was 4,000 years before the era, is bordered by the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean Sea in the west. Since the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, it has broken the Cape of Good Hope route in the Middle Ages and has become the throat of European and Asian transportation. The Nile River basin is to the east, and the Libyan Desert is to the west. The land is in the tropics, and all things are fertile. Natural phenomena are deeply imprinted in the minds of ordinary people. Because of the belief in polytheism and the idea that natural life exists forever, the expressions in art are used to decorate tombs and temples. Egyptians regard their homes as inns, and tombs as the permanent resting place for their souls. In addition to the pyramids, the great buildings also include the Sphinx, whose meaning cannot be speculated. It is believed to be the statue of the sun god, because the sun and the universe are eternal.</p>
<p>The splendid flowers of ancient European culture flourished in Egypt on the banks of the Nile and in Babylon, which rose in Mesopotamia. The Greek nation, endowed with artistic talent, inherited its heritage and carried it forward. In the history of art, it established a tendency to naturalism and gave full play to the spirit of realism. This point is very different from Egypt's symbolic religion, flaunting of imperial power, and inherited style. Greece is located on a peninsula, facing Egypt across the sea. It already had culture in the Bronze Age. The nation admired nature, loved sports, and was very interested in the concept of human beauty. The Olympia Games were the first sports meet promoted by the Greeks. They took the mood of appreciating the beauty of the human body and created it on the path of art, making Greek culture reach the realm of perfection. The surviving masterpieces of statues, such as "Doryphorous" and "Discobolus," broke the Egyptian rigid frontal style, fully demonstrated free posture, and became the pioneer of the art world of the entire European continent.</p>
<p>Chinese artists worship nature, praise nature, and depict nature. They can go deep into the core of nature, express its sublime magnificence, and depict layers of overlapping mountains. Therefore, painters take the depiction of landscapes as their only object, and extend to insects, fish, birds, and beasts. The poet's indifferent feelings of "Picking chrysanthemums under the eastern fence, leisurely seeing the southern mountains," is why Tao Yuanming loves "the chrysanthemum that still has frost-resistant branches." Why does Lin Hejing love plum blossoms? Because it can contain fragrance in the severe winter and lead the spring. Why does Zhou Dunyi love lotus flowers? Because it emerges from the mud without being stained, peeping into the virtues of a gentleman. In my personal studio, I often like to hang a small couplet written by Si Zizhen: "Listening to ancient music when washing water, admiring great sages when encountering towering mountains." I get infinite life hints and spiritual comfort between my daily ups and downs.</p>
<p>Indians are worshippers of religion, love all things, and take compassion as a precept, rejecting worldly desires and entering the world of great harmony and bliss as the highest ideal of life. The expression in his art is spotless, quiet, and solemn. I thought of a poem by Zhu Xi: "A half-acre square pond opens like a mirror, the light of the sky and the shadows of the clouds linger together; ask how it can be so clear, because there is a source of living water." The so-called source of living water is the state of mind of Indian philosophers, otherwise how could it produce great modern poets such as Tagore, philosophers such as Gandhi, and Nietzsche's philosophical thoughts, which formed a strong contrast.</p>

<p>One</p>
<p>I gallop wildly on a steed,</p>
<p>Rushing from an unknown sphere,</p>
<p>Towards another yet unseen;</p>
<p>I cry hoarsely: stop indeed!</p>
<p>Stop! I see meteors streak the sky,</p>
<p>Their brilliant gleam's front and rear,</p>
<p>Boundless darkness; I see clear</p>
<p>Emperors entombed, in silence lie.</p>
<p>Stop! Who neglects the reins they hold,</p>
<p>Letting them run so wild and free?</p>
<p>Watching the plunge, a precipice steep,</p>
<p>Does slumber's tale yet unfold?</p>
<p>Hoarse cries lost in a lengthening breeze;</p>
<p>I still hear hooves' pounding decrees.</p>

<p>Asking these questions, hard to retrieve.</p>
<p>Yet much or little, I know not where</p>

<p>Or in some erudite book deep and vast:</p>

<p>Just before I was foolish, with fate</p>
<p>Imposing comprehension where none may rest,</p>

<p>Far from life's alternating elect.</p>
<h3>Nietzsche Was a Doctor</h3>
<p>— Hua Lin</p>
<p>Compared to Tolstoy, Nietzsche came from a poor background and suffered from the cold mockery of society. He discovered the heartless and harsh nature of life and pitied himself with compassion. Tolstoy's situation was the opposite; he was born into nobility, indulged in unrestrained behavior, discovered his own misconduct, and punished himself with cruelty, while showing compassion and pity for others!</p>
<p>A similar analogy can be drawn between Nietzsche and a close friend. When we care for a sick family member, we fully express compassionate sympathy and receive comforting consideration from relatives. However, the doctor who treats the illness maintains a stern and calm demeanor, performing surgery without regard for the patient's pain. He wants the patient to be strong, to heal the illness, and does not speak of emotions!</p>
<p>A close friend's thinking is based on normal social life, while Nietzsche's is about treating the pain of life. He said that before the greatest pain, one can experience the highest new hope!</p>
<p>Life is like an ancient pine on a mountaintop, its branches growing upward, reaching for sunlight; but its roots must delve deep into the soil, into the crevices of rocks, even into the abyss of darkness. The wise philosopher plays his solitude, savors his pain, leaves his crowd, abandons his morality: first, he is a camel carrying a heavy load in the desert; then, he becomes a lion in the wilderness; and finally, he becomes an innocent and forgetful child, constantly creating his new life, cycling endlessly, what is called the "eternal recurrence"!</p>
<p>This coronation of laughter is a crown of roses. Such laughter is also sacred. Great figures should always learn to laugh! Laugh! Dance! Use the wings of laughing dance to fly over your own world! Nietzsche moved from pessimistic philosophy to the path of happiness, affirming everything and striving forward actively!</p>
<p>In this cruel and heartless society, crying out is useless and receives no sympathy. Nietzsche, both in life and after death, suffered the cold mockery of society. Therefore, I believe that Nietzsche, Tolstoy, and a close friend, these three creators, have made very great contributions to life. Nietzsche is simply a doctor who treats the illness, not a relative who comforts the patient! We, as scholars, should observe them separately and take the best from each!</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 60</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>A fellow comrade stepped forward to explain our identities. The sentry at the guard post called the temporary action headquarters in the city and, upon receiving permission, allowed us to pass. However, the road was broken, and the car could not pass. We had to leave the car outside the blockade, entrusting it to the sentry, and proceed on foot.</p>
<p>It was dark all around, even the streetlights were off, perhaps for defense against unexpected attacks. Fortunately, there was only one main road, so even though we were exploring step by step, it was not difficult. After walking less than a hundred meters, we suddenly saw a beam of yellow light approaching us, it was a car heading in our direction. We hurriedly moved to the side of the road, but the car screeched to a halt beside us. This was thanks to Mr. W's thoroughness. He had already received news of our departure. He had received the phone call from the sentry and rushed to meet us.</p>
<p>(As I record this, I can't help but suspect that some people will say these records of mine are a novel because there are indeed many "coincidences" in it. I am too lazy to argue about this. Just take our twenty-four-hour day, isn't there also a lot of "coincidence" in it? For example, you dress up neatly, ready to visit a friend, and that friend happens to come to your house at that time. If this were written in a book, wouldn't people suspect that the author was playing tricks, turning it into "no coincidence, no story"?)</p>
<p>Before we arrived at the temporary action headquarters, under the dim streetlights, we only saw one thing that filled my heart with a mixture of sadness and emotion: along both sides of the road, the shops were all hung with the national flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun. Although some were old, the fold lines from years of storage were deeply pressed in, and some were not properly stored, and the colors were faded, yet it was still a national flag!</p>
<p>The temporary action commander was a shrewd and capable middle-aged man. As soon as we met, he handed me a telegram that had just arrived from Mr. W:</p>
<p>"Ping, 04 received and forwarded, Chief Zhi, Yue, Liu box structure complicated and tricky, needs a lot of Sunrise brand, if can send at previously agreed price, very welcome, can guarantee brisk sales. Zhi Branch must move to Jin to open first, miss Qun, Hu, two partners; must try best to find, will definitely be first-class helpers in the future. Liao He, Jing kowtow."</p>
<p>"Liu Box" is a subtle metaphor for the location of the "Seven Sealed Secret Documents". "Sunrise Brand" was a nickname He Jian gave me. He always joked with me, calling me Sunrise Brand cigarettes, meaning that I could supplement his thoughts or help him with work he temporarily forgot. "Zhi Branch" is the secret radio station in Changxindian. "Qun Hu Two Partners" clearly refers to Yao Qun and Little Tiger. I and Mr. W had conveyed the news of their disappearance to him because he was extremely concerned about their work and whereabouts. "Jing" is Tokyo. The telegram did not need to add many hidden words, but for me and him, these team words were just ordinary words and not secret.</p>
<p>The detailed explanation of the telegram is that the exploration of the "Seven Sealed Secret Documents" is tricky and he wants me to go and help. The 29th Army Headquarters is moving south, presumably Matsui is going to work in Shanxi, so he told me to order 04 to track him. The rest is about caring for Yao Qun and Little Tiger and that we must do our best to find them.</p>
<p>I was concentrating on the telegram when suddenly I heard someone shout from the side:</p>

<h3>Mutual Trust</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Recently, there have been many petitions to the capital from Shanxi and Beijing. Regardless of what kind of organization the petitioners are or what kind of nature they have, we hope that there will be fewer of these actions.</p>
<p>Beijing and Shanghai are close at hand. Telegrams and telephones can transmit messages in less than an hour. Why bother with such exhausting travel? Some people say that it is precisely because they are so close that airplanes take only two or three hours and sleeper cars on the Beijing-Shanghai line allow one to sleep until Xixia, so it doesn't hurt to go. If the capital were as far away as Beijing in the past, with treacherous mountains and obstacles and a journey of three and a half months, there would not be such enthusiastic eagerness as there is now.</p>
<p>If this statement holds true, then the petitioners' determination is highly questionable.</p>
<p>In fact, it is still a matter of mutual trust.</p>
<p>What is prevalent in the current society is "reporting everything in person." This shows that the trust in written documents has been discounted. Everyone does not treat written documents as a serious matter, and the result is naturally the trouble of personal contact between people. However, under the complex social relations of today, it is inevitably close to a waste.</p>
<p>How to establish mutual trust? Start with being responsible for everyone's words and deeds. Knowingly ineffective perfunctory documents, or suggestions and plans that you might as well try, should be written less. In this way, the value of written documents will not be taken lightly.</p>
<p>Foreign News</p>
<h3>Terrible Washington</h3>
<p>— Yu Qiang Translated from "Magazine Digest," Original by Sidney Kalz</p>
<p>Undemocratic</p>
<p>Washington is the capital of the United States. In terms of local administrative regions, it transcends the forty-eight states and is specifically designated as the "District of Columbia," and its residents are also "transcendent": they have no voting rights, no autonomy, and no right to sue or be sued in federal courts! This is truly a "strange thing" in the democratic world. A Washington resident said angrily: "This is a contradiction. In this democratic country, nearly a million citizens are denied the most basic rights of a free society."</p>
<p>Very Chaotic</p>
<p>The municipal administration of the District of Columbia is managed by three commissioners appointed by the president. Below them are about sixty departments, bureaus, offices, committees, and other organizations, but some of these organizations are "redundant," and some have unclear responsibilities. But citizens have no right to supervise these secret policies.</p>
<p>What really governs Washington's municipal administration are two "District of Columbia Committees" set up in the Senate and House of Representatives. Washington citizens put it well: "But all senators and representatives are representatives of citizens from other states!" The spirit of the committee is: "Everyone's business is no one's business." The staff are already busy enough with their own voters, so they have no extra energy to take care of the District of Columbia. Therefore, it is often difficult to find a few talented members to serve on the District of Columbia Committee. Take the current chairman of the committee, Senator Bilbo, for example. He is the one who promised voters in his hometown of Missouri that he would not give Washington citizens the right to vote.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives and the Senate promulgate national legislation, but when they are asked to promulgate a city's municipal council's bill, the result is heartbreaking. Almost every proposal is lost in the parliamentary agenda. When there is an urgent need for funds for schools, hospitals, or prisons, the result is often tragic.</p>
<p>Unfair</p>
<p>What's more, the financial distribution between the local government and the federal government is also unfairly decided. A famous Washington lawyer said: Although the government occupies 20% of the city's land, we are forced to pay 90% of the municipal expenses. In addition, we also provide the government with 100,000 yuan of free tap water every year, as well as some police, fire protection, and other services.</p>
<p>Due to lack of funds and a government without civic autonomy, Washington's municipal administration is simply terrible. Let me give a few examples!</p>
<p>Galinnger Hospital has 146 infant deaths each year, accounting for 66 per thousand births. This rate is three times higher than the largest municipal hospital in the United States. From 3 p.m. to 11 p.m., there is only one trained nurse, assisted by a few untrained maids, taking care of 100 newborns. In the following eight hours, there is no trained nurse on duty, and the helpless babies are hungry, waiting for the bottles to be placed in their mouths.</p>
<p>What about education? Mrs. Wallace once wrote an article and published it in the newspaper, portraying the fears of thousands of Washington mothers: "As the mother of a school-age child, I am horrified to think of what my child's education will lead him to if the current situation is allowed to continue."</p>
<p>What is the current situation? Let's look at Assistant Superintendent Wilkinson's report: "More than 100 primary classes and two junior high schools are reducing teaching hours" - the result of a shortage of school buildings and teachers. Seven thousand students only attend classes for three and a half hours a day. Mrs. Lunke, of the Home and School Association, warned: "Our society will pay a heavy price for part-time education. If our children are not in school, they may lead themselves astray."</p>
<p>Another dispute between Washington citizens and the government is the deployment of the capital police. Washington currently has 1,685 police officers, but according to the Chamber of Commerce, at least 2,500 are needed. If Police Chief Coraghan could fully deploy these more than one thousand police officers to protect citizens, it would be somewhat passable, but in reality, it is not the case at all. When a VIP comes to Beijing and stays at the Blair Hotel, a team of police officers must be sent to guard the post. Or, if an important person has an appointment with the president, then the motorcycle patrol team will be dispatched to escort him.</p>
<h3>A Major Problem in Shanghai: Unemployed: More Than 250,000 People Unemployed: More Than 1.35 Million People</h3>
<p>— Jin Xia</p>
<p>The results of the "Occupational Census" in this city have been completely compiled and the following figures were released in the middle of last month: the total population of this city is 3.96 million, with more than 1.549 million employed, more than 250,000 unemployed, and more than 1.353 million unemployed. This has formed a serious social problem. (Note: unemployed refers to vagrants who have never been employed.)</p>
<p>The phenomenon of unemployment is unavoidable in all countries, especially in cities. Due to overstaffing, the result of competition is the survival of the fittest, resulting in a group of unemployed people. According to a 1915 survey, there were more than 400,000 workers in major cities in the United States, of which 15% were unemployed. According to a survey in New York City, in 1930, the total population of New York City was more than 7 million, and the total number of unemployed citizens was about 444,000. In 1900, a survey by the US Census Bureau showed that there were 6.47 million unemployed people in the United States.</p>
<p>The United States is the most developed and wealthy industrial country, and there are so many unemployed people. The number of unemployed people in other countries can be imagined.</p>
<p>In the past, there was an "Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center" in this city. According to the registration figures from 1935 to 1937, the center stated that an average of more than 50 citizens went to the center every day to fill out "job application registrations." At most, there were more than 90 people a day, while there were no more than three or four people a day who filled out "job search registrations," resulting in a disparity of ten to one. Most of the job seekers are ordinary talents, while most of the job searchers need specialized talents, so the actual number of people who find jobs is even less. Among these job seekers are children under the age of fifteen and elderly people over the age of fifty. The pressure of food and clothing is a sigh.</p>
<p>The following is a statistic of the number of unemployed people in Shanghai each year, which will serve as the end of this article: 1935 - 500,000 people; 1936 - 520,000 people, 1937 - 700,000 people, 1939 - about 600,000 people (only statistics from the two "concessions").</p>
<h3>Tokyo, the Capital of the Defeated Country, Has Restored the Pre-War Scene</h3>
<h3>Goodbye, Neon Lights</h3>
<p>— Zheng</p>
<p>Pushing open the window, the night sky outside seemed particularly lonely, as if something was missing. After thinking carefully, I realized that the familiar neon sign advertising the Wing On Company on the roof was gone, the towering roof disappearing into the darkness.</p>
<p>Opening the newspaper: "In order to solve the current electricity shortage, the Municipal Public Utility Bureau has banned the use of outdoor neon lights in all stores." The ban was actually implemented on the first of this month! But a few nights ago, the neon lights were still dazzlingly beautiful, and merchants were unwilling to stop using them; now, however, the neon lights have been extinguished, and the night in Shanghai seems to have lost its luster.</p>
<p>Regarding neon lights, in my stubborn mind, I have always considered them the "waves of sin," symbolizing the atmosphere of Shanghai at the end of the century. Every night, looking down from the window, the red and green "sea of light" always made me feel uncomfortable. Now that the lights are all off, although I don't feel lonely, my heart is indeed much clearer.</p>
<p>These are all empty words. Let's be more realistic! The ban on neon lights has undoubtedly been a major blow to merchants in general, and the business at night has been somewhat affected. The first to bear the brunt are the twenty-odd neon sign advertising companies, which have no way out from now on and are bound to complain. However, the ban on neon lights is only a temporary measure, and once the electricity supply is slightly more abundant, the original situation should be restored immediately. The Public Utility Bureau is assisting Chinese businessmen and the Pudong Electric Company in purchasing small generators, and has ordered the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to rush to repair the generators for use. It can be seen that the authorities have also put in a lot of effort.</p>
<p>I think that the prosperity of Shanghai at night does not necessarily depend entirely on the dazzling red and green lights. The rouge on a lady's face is not real blood!</p>
<h3>Duality</h3>
<p>— Yang Ren</p>
<p>After reading the article "Unit Names" in this publication the other day, I was reminded of the many "dualistic" things in our society today, which make people lack a unified concept of them, and they are chaotic and confusing. No wonder the country cannot be unified! Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the calendar. Although the government has long stipulated the use of the solar calendar, the actual situation in society is still based on the lunar calendar, but there are a few more names, forms, and holidays: the solar New Year is celebrated first, then the lunar New Year; the New Year holiday is followed by the winter holiday; the year-end settlement is followed by a final settlement, and so on.</p>
<p>There are civilized and old-fashioned ways of getting married; civilized ones are more free, and it is not surprising to get married today and divorced tomorrow, while old-fashioned ones are more stubborn, with transactions completed, following the chicken and the dog.</p>
<p>There is the quintessence of Chinese medicine, and there is also Western medicine, which has been Westernized. You say I am not good, and I say you are not good; only the patients suffer. Which one should they consult?</p>
<p>Due to space constraints, I will not list any more, but in short, this inconsistent phenomenon makes people feel funny and bewildered! And in this society where "everything has a pair," people with "dual personalities" are of course the most common and the most suitable for the environment!</p>
<h3>Advertising Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Gang Wu</p>
<p>The Double Axe Cigarette advertisement is quite subtle: "Made by domestic technicians, made with American tobacco leaves, 'taken over' by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, 'China'… product, 'always' satisfied, 'lasting' popular."</p>
<p>The slogan of Fumin Trachoma Eye Drops: "The latest American raw materials, China's 'first' 'creation'." I wonder if foreign arms factories can imitate Xi Shi, writing "Chinese raw materials, American creation" on their tungsten products.</p>
<p>The Queen's Theater presents Ruan Lingyu: "New glass coffin shipped from the United States," is indeed a "first look," no need to "respectfully request."</p>
<p>The Grand Theater: "Ticket sales are 'like a tide,' seat reservations are 'rebellious'." And: "Solemnly introduce Bai Yuyan, if anyone recognizes that it is not her, we are willing to pay 5 million yuan." I never thought that for the sake of "5 million," it would actually lead to "rebellion"!</p>
<p>"'The best' opportunity to 'benefit your children and grandchildren'!" People with good intentions quickly look down to see: "The Moral Bookstore has more than 100 kinds of Buddhist scriptures, Taoist scriptures, and various good books in stock, various Dharma items, Dharma instruments…" The more they read, the more confused they become, only remembering the opening words "morality," which are indeed important.</p>
<h3>Weekend Tea Talk</h3>
<p>— Mo Yu</p>
<p>New Outlook on Life</p>
<p>Recently, there has been an interesting incident in the Chengdu city streets: a maid in a certain family gave birth to an illegitimate child in the toilet. That night was full of thunder and lightning, and torrential rain. The next morning, the neighbors heard the news and said that the child was driven out by the God of Thunder, and that the master would be very wealthy. They competed to buy him for 100,000 legal tender, regretting that they had missed this good opportunity. An illegitimate child was eagerly snapped up, and thunder and lightning really helped this little life. Those who arrived later stamped their feet and sighed. This is because they watched helplessly as someone took away a "wealthy and noble" money tree; their intentions were the same, not to nurture the child, but to get a "Supreme Emperor" to do nothing and enjoy a peaceful old age. If this child later drinks, gambles, prostitutes, and has no "noble" signs, then his fate will probably be completely different from the scene when he was still alive in the wind and rain. The world is tumultuous, and everyone is planning for themselves. No wonder even if there have been figures like Mozi and Roosevelt in a few centuries, it has not helped to eliminate the psychology of everyone gritting their teeth and rubbing their fists, which is exactly the same. "Where the benefit lies, it is like water flowing downwards." This is what it means!</p>
<p>Rats and Foxes</p>
<p>A few days ago, goods stored in warehouses along the Bund were often reported to have disappeared. Some cargo ships were anchored in the river and had not yet been unloaded; but the fresh goods loaded inside had already been sold in the market. This situation was also "popular" in Hong Kong for a while. It is said that the most strange thing is that no trace of opening can be found on the stolen wooden boxes. This is of course a masterpiece of cooperation between some "high-class Chinese" and "foreign experts." In Hong Kong, they are respectfully called "warehouse rats." When there are many such rats, the associated "smuggling foxes" are produced; the rats squeak and squeak and take things out of the warehouses and ships, and the foxes sneak around and move things from east to west. The result? Naturally, business is booming, and wealth is flourishing. The rats and foxes secretly change their appearances, which are no longer those of "lice on drums" with outstretched tails. Dressed in suits, with cigars in hand, they use ill-gotten gains, singing and drinking, socializing with foreign merchants, still the true colors of high-class Chinese. Do you think that the gentlemen who boss you around in front of you during the day are noble? Have you ever noticed their behavior behind people's backs? Have you ever touched the tail they drag behind them? Hasn't the neon sign of "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame" on top of the International Hotel been dim these past few nights?</p>
<p>Laughable</p>
<p>It is said that many strange Taoists have recently appeared on the streets of Chongqing, claiming to be from Mount Emei. Because the Third World War is about to break out, they have come to save all living beings; each talisman costs 500 yuan, and its effect can avoid atomic bombs. Quite a few people buy the talismans, and even the police on duty listen with great interest and encourage passers-by to buy them. It is rare that they actually "cherish each other." This Taoist must have cultivated to a considerable level; it is a pity that he did not make a special trip to Shanghai, otherwise those who watch "selling tricks" at the entrance of the New City God Temple and those who watch "flying sword taking heads" at the Grand Theater would have new comfort; let the atomic bomb explode quickly! When the earth is full of holes and wounds, we can have talismans on our bodies and be free from any taboos!</p>
<p>"Metabolism"</p>
<p>It is said that the Personnel Office of the Taiwan Provincial Government announced that from the 12th to the 18th of September, in just one week, 493 people were appointed, and 213 people were dismissed. Taiwan has returned to the motherland for a year, but because it has been deeply poisoned by the enemy in the past, we naturally have nothing to criticize about this drastic style of promoting metabolism among political officials; however, in some friends' scattered letters, I heard that Taiwanese generally still call people from other provinces who go to Taiwan "Chinese people," call Zhongshan suits and cheongsams "Chinese clothes," and call the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag the "Chinese flag"; the Daming Daily also often has sentences like: "During the Japanese rule, no matter by ship or car, there was always an intention to load the province's fruits that could be exported smoothly? ... If you want to smoothly export green fruits to your country, it is temporarily impossible to expect it unless the operators themselves purchase and prepare their own ships." (Original) and other sentences that always seem to have some flavor; I don't know if this time, among those large numbers of appointed and dismissed personnel, anyone was drawn to first correct this sprawling matter to be more presentable?</p>
