<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕國大主席團第廿五次會，廿二日下午六時舉行，李大明主席，決議事項如次：（一）國大第十六次大會，廿三日上午九時半舉行，由谷正綱主席。（二）第十七次大會，廿三日下午三時舉行。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕國大連日進行順利，可望不再延期，各代表以已屆歲暮，正紛紛準備作歸計，中國·中央兩航空公司，己準備平·津·漢·渝·穗各班專機運送代表，兩公司廿五日至廿七三日京滬間客票亦停止發售。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿二日電〕憲草條文已二讀過半，國大閉幕在即，聞胡適已定廿六日離京飛平，處理北大校務。又交通部對國大代表之機位，亦已妥爲安排，票價亦一律八折優待。</p>
<h3>憲草二讀已過半　自五十四條至八十二條　大部討論完竣已予通過</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕國大第十五次大會，二十二日下午三時四十分舉行，開會時出席代表一三五二人，後續增至一四〇〇人，白崇禧主席，由報告員宣讀十四次會議紀録後，自第五章「行政」第五十四條開始，繼續二讀會之程序，討論憲章修正案及各代表依職事規則第二十四條之規定，對審查報告提出之修正案。異議通過。第『五十六」條有趙代表子懋等三十五人提出修正案，擬對行政院劉院長代理院長職務之期限爲三月之限制，以免立法院之同意權落空，而有「由次等人物」長期主持行政重任之危險，但經討論表決後，遭否決，仍依原文通過。第「五十七」「五十八」兩條無異議通過。至第「五十九」條居代表正發言，主張原憲草行政院向立法院提出大赦案一點，不必刪去。渠謂：「抗戰八年以來，法令限制殊多，政治復未步上正軌，人民干犯獲罪者至眾，各地牢獄莫不人滿爲患，司法院會請頒大赦令，乃以立法程序，至今猶未完成，無從理淸，各位注意，司法方面此一困難事實，而體諒百黎，爲政府保留此種權限。」居氏辭畢，白主席宣稱：主席團對此意見暫作保留，眾代表乃紛紛質問主席團權何偌大？旋潘代表公展於混亂中發言，認爲此非保留之問題，乃係是否提出覆職問題。白主席復稱：如欲覆職變更審查報告，請依議事規則正式提出，原文仍經表決通過。第六十，六十一兩條，無異議通過。第六章「立法」第六十二，六十三兩條，無異議通過。第六十四條「立法院得接受人民之請願」，陳代表顧遠等三十五人，提出修正案，以人民之請願權，於第十七條中已有廣泛規定，如對立法院再作特殊規定，反有限制之嫌，且條文規定「得接受」一點，與理不合，擬請予以刪除，表決結果以一〇六九票之絕對多數通過，該條刪去。第六十五條中對其第一項區域產生立委名額之規定，有兩修正案：一爲傅代表斯年等四十五人提出，爲顧及立委人數過多，易於發生困難，請求改爲人口未滿五（原爲三百萬人）百萬人者五人，超過五百萬人省，每滿二（原爲一百萬人）百萬人，增選一人。另一爲趙代表珮等三十六人提出，爲免除少數入口眾多省籍之立委，操縱會議之流弊，請將依人口比例增選之立委，改爲每滿三（原爲一百萬人）百萬人增選一人．傳趙兩氏說明理由後，劉振東等先後聲述反對，溥儒亦於樓座中數次起立，均未獲發言空隙，會塲空氣頓見緊張。白主席當應若干會眾之要求，提付表決，結果傅氏修正案獲五六五票，趙　　氏修正案獲三二六票，均逍否決，該條仍維原案。第六十六至七十二等六條（原第六十八條刪去）均無異議通過。第七十三條有史代表尚寬等三十四人提出修正案，認爲除行政院外，考試·司法·監察各院，就其主管事項之法律案，應得列席立法院會議，經表決後，以九四七票多數通過，該條修改爲：「立法院開會時，關係（原文爲行政）」院院長各部會首長，得列席陳述意見」。第七十四至七十八等五條，均無異議通過。時爲五時正，休息二十分鐘後，繼續開會。第七十九條有倪代表弼等三十四人及張代表冕等三十一人提出兩修正案，均擬修改爲：「立委除現行犯（下加六字）及已受追訴者外，非經立法院許可不得逮捕或拘禁」，經討論表決後，遭否決，而以一〇五八票之絕對多數，維持原文。第八十條有張代表忠道等三十五人提出修正案，擬修改爲「立法委員（下加四字）於任期內，不得兼任（下加三字）或轉任官吏」，張氏對此案加以說明後，頗得會眾擁護，但經表決獲六〇二票，仍以少數遭否決。第八一條無異議通過。第七章「司法」第八二絛關於公務員懲戒權問題，引起辯論。谷代表鳳翔等五十八人，提出該條與第九十五絛之修正案，主張此權歸屬監察院，當有張代表施武等贊成，認爲現憲草中監察院權力過小，廳以懲戒權充實之，以求五權之均衡。旋衛挺生於斯嘶聲中發言反對，經表決後修正案僅獲三四一票，而以一〇五八票之大多數，通過維持原文。至此六時正，乃停止討論，由洪秘書長報告，廿三日上下午舉行大會，主席團於散會後集議，後即告散會。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕國府改組消息，在國大行將閉幕聲中，傳說甚眾，據記者向各方探詢，藉悉若干人士認爲明年元旦改組完成說，似嫌過早，因民社黨迄今尚無正式表示，靑年黨自可無問題，但人選亦尚未作最後決定。據雷震語記者，國府委會之改組，自極迅速，一俟各方名單交出，即可實現。又對於重開和談訊，政府方面代表，均表示正向此方向進行，並相信即有所成就。</p>

<h3>共軍數萬竄蘇北　魯聊城遭砲轟情勢危急</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南廿二日電〕此間盛傳共軍將於最近發動新攻勢，圍攻濟南，據某軍事觀察家稱：濟南爲山東之心臟，膠濟綫爲橫貫東西之山東唯一大動脈，就政略言，攻佔濟南，即可聲聞中外，表示共產黨力量之强大興堅定，某某第三方面繼續爲共產黨搖旗吶喊。就戰略言，攻佔濟南，膠濟錢不攻自破，整個山東即入其掌握，山東不守後，共軍小則可北上平津，與國軍成對峙之局，大則可南下江南，以成席捲之勢，體之冀豫共軍紛向魯北魯西移動，劉伯誠且入駐德州，蘇北共軍主力及陳毅之回竄魯南，共軍魯境解放區積極徵兵，凡男年在十五至五十歲，女在十六至四十歲，無不在強徽之列，即知其企圖似不在小。惟此固乃共軍之片面如意算盤耳。濟南在王兼司令官領導下，旣已渡過過去最艱苦之十六個月，今實力充沛，民心安定，軍令政令旣告統一，只因限於政府再四容忍之下（停戰令〕之約束，在軍事上無法爭取主動，茍共軍不自量力，徒見其自取滅亡耳。</p>

<h3>法越衝突愈見劇烈　戰事擴至北圻全區　越盟發言人表示寗死不屈</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社河內廿二日電〕據此間消息：河內之戰事現已擴大至整個北圻區域。截至月前爲止，河內法軍五十名陣亡，另有一百五十名受傷，歐洲人及歐亞人數名聞亦殞命或失踪。藩郎，關安，巴寗與南定各地法軍，己克復原來陣地，但戰事繼續未已。四十八小時以來，河內至海防之公路綫有若干處被切斷，顧化城亦在河內被攻之當夜遭襲擊。杜拉納港方面，普無戰事，大抵因法軍兵力雄厚及港內有法艦停泊之故。義安城方面，越盟當局向法國代表提出最後通牒，要求法軍繳械。聞北圻法軍司令莫利零將軍已准許接受最後通諜，以免該城法人遭屠殺。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿二日電〕外交部今日正式宣稱：越南東京及安南兩區內之維明軍，已經法軍於今日下午完全肅淸，河內公濟醫院巳經法軍佔領，維明軍全部潰退，已無再攻力量，法軍死傷亦眾。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿二日電〕今晨法國大多數報紙社論，均要求法政府對越南採取張硬行動，甚至反對利用武力之共產黨「人類報」，亦重申法軍留駐越南之意向，人民共和黨報紙則重視日軍參加越盟軍隊作戰之一項消息，向越盟總統胡志明有所責難。</p>

<h3>越南分裂派籌組　「國民陣綫政府」</h3>
<p>美否認越要求干涉法越衝突說</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社南京廿二日電〕越南國民黨領袖即越盟共和國民政府前任外交部長莫英桐丹，現在南京，與國民黨其他領袖數人，共寓於外交部大廈對面之某中式小旅館內。葛氏今日向本社記者談稱：越南「國民陣綫政府」，業己組成，在適當時機，即可宜佈。葛氏對於新政府之所在，拒絕發表，大抵在中國，可能即在南京。葛氏大約將出任總理或外長或兼任二者。新政府之四大政綱如下：</p>
<p>（一）由中美兩國出面調處，以便對法展開談判，並保證將來所可成立之任何協定。立即付諸實施。</p>
<p>（二）越盟必須在越南聯邦與法國聯邦機構內成爲名符其實的自由邦，必須有派遺外交代表之權利，其領土須擴大至北緯第十六度以南，即除北圻外，尚當包括中圻中部及南圻。（照其規定，則越盟共和國以外，僅餘老撾與柬埔寨兩邦爲越南聯邦領土矣。）</p>
<p>（三）越盟在越南聯邦參政會中，必須有適當比例的代表。參政會主席爲法國人，但其權力當爲純粹代表性質，一如英國駐澳洲專員之類。</p>
<p>（四）法軍得在越盟境內佔有若干特定之地點，此項地點由共同協定商定而法軍必須在五年內自各該地撤退。越盟境內法國人全部經濟與文化利益，當由越盟政府忠實保證。</p>
<p>葛氏及其同僚因不願參加法越談判，故退出胡志明之聯合政府。萬氏對胡氏加以指責，謂本年九月間法越雙方在法國楓丹白露鎮談判破裂，越代表首送返國，但胡氏則單獨與法方簽訂臨時協定，自失信用於國人。再者，胡氏亦不孚眾望，因其親近共黨之故。本年一月間之解散共黨命令，不過爲官樣文章，胡志明仍聽命於莫斯科。胡志明政府遲早將辭職，而由新組織之「國民政府」代替，俾設法與南京及華盛頓接觸，要求調處云。</p>

<h3>社論　减稅運動</h3>
<p>市參議員陳維儉等建議减少捐稅，以期減輕民眾之負祖，此事狠值得大眾注意。在這司農仰屋，羅掘俱空的時候，要希望牠立刻見效，眞所謂談何容易。但問題確狠嚴重，原案稱：「非但社會秩序將起混亂，且將影響全國之混亂」，也不算過甚其詞。這裏且把現在太不合理的種種稅收情形，的略撮舉數事如左，以喚起大眾的注意。</p>
<p>（一）太重　古稱什一之征，征到十分之二，己覺非民力所能負担。現在却以奢侈，消費，娛樂等等名義，每每征到百分之四十，五十，乃至值百抽百，抽二百，甚至全盤的盈利照單全收之外，還要加征半數。說到租稅原理，這裏還有何等原理可談？無非飲鴆止渴，殺鷄取卵，聊以應急而已。但是「百姓不足，對孰與足」？稅源到了涸竭的地步，社會上平添了許多待救濟的失業分子，監獄中增加了無數挺而走險的不良分子，在國家徒然增加負擔。究竟孰得孰失，只消把眼光略爲放遠些，那是人人見得到的。</p>
<p>（二）太繁　最近鄂省參議會開會，有某參議員翱售，漢口商家，每月應繳的捐稅，多到三十餘種，幾乎每日要完捐稅一道，這是現在捐稅太繁的一個實證。其實巧立名目，橫征暴斂，何止漢口一埠？不過其他各處，沒人加以統計罷了。</p>
<p>（三）太虛偽有許多斂錢的方法，表面上總假惜若干冠冕堂皇的理由，來作爲幌子，因而製造出許多表格和手續來。例如，登記，註册，貼花，領證，查驗等等，除掉證件，還要保證；而且紙張要錢，登記要錢，領證要錢。領證當然要錢可不必說，但甚至抄錄，檢查，掛失，補辦等等，無一不要錢，，似乎總覺有點說不過去。我們不否認：這裏自有幾種，在法律上似乎是必要的。但有其他許多，除掉爲政府增加收入以外，並沒有其他的效用。如果單爲調查統計作用，那麼犯不着費如許力氣。如果爲保障某種權益，說是必須經過如此手續，法律上才得到保障。那麼，法律上的保障，是否必須經過如此手續，似乎也是疑問。換句話說：沒有經過這些手續，法律上也未必完全加以排斥。耳目所及，這些登記、駐册、查驗…等等，能够悉數依限辦理就緒的，更其並不多見。我們的見斛，是：如果爲收入起見，那麼，狠可以省略手續，直捷痛快地照章抽稅，在公家倒可落得實惠，在民眾也免滋粉擾</p>
<p>（四）太不合理這裏包括主辦的機關太多，員役太多，以至收入的大部份，完全用在征收費上，使公家得不到實惠。而且有許多稅目，過於細碎，用力雖勤，收效極微。至於疊床架屋，一物兩稅，甲稅未了，乙稅又來，既征現在，還溯過去等等，我們認爲都不合理。</p>
<p>（五）太笨拙有人以爲我國官吏最擅搜括，這話也是一面之詞。過去有若干捐稅，因爲官辦的成績太劣，只得招商承辦，或由各業認辦，可知他們的征收技術，並不高妙。這種情形，現在雖己逐漸减少，但是章則太繁，手續太多，有好許多新式的稅則，過於繁重，以致納稅人走頭無路，不得不請教專門家如會計師之類來代爲承辦，就是經征人員，也覺得內容過於複雜，如果絲絲入扣，一一照辦起來，未免勞民傷財，久稽時日。所以在體卹商艱的口號之下，便有許多簡化稽征的變通辦法，應運而來。據說：其中也頗有一部份近于包認的地方。這種辦法，在納稅人方面，多少可省些麻煩，我們並不欲加以善議。所可怪的，是旣知簡化，何以立法又如此之密？立法旣密，何以又可予以簡化？這實在是個難以索解的問題。</p>
<p>照此看來，陳參議員等所提减少捐稅一案，內容相當繁複，不應僅以减少稅目爲滿足。諸凡稅率，稅則，乃至稅制等，統統應該調查明白，請政府予以合理的調</p>
<p>其次還有幾點，與本案直接有關，也值得提一提，其一，新的捐稅，不宜輕率創辦。尤不宜由行政官廳自由創辦。現在各地民意機關，己經普遍地成立，必須提請各該民意機關，正式通過，方可依法公佈。因爲各種捐稅；在公告施行之初，往往具有一種很動聽的理由，而且說：這是臨時的性質，一俟期限屆滿，定予取消，而實際則頒行甚易，取消甚難。即如現在本市倚爲大宗收入的筵席捐，旅館捐等，在當初原屬救濟難民的一種樂捐性質，豈知事過境遷，便成爲當地可靠的經常收入。所謂市政建設捐，能否如期截止現在又是一個問題。所以創立新捐新稅，確是一個十分嚴重的問題，斷不可掉以輕心。其二，任何捐稅，不宜標以用途的名稱。例如建設捐，衛生捐，教育捐等。因爲財政原則，重在統收統支，原有預算，未必無此等經費在內，如果確實不敷，自可斟酌緩急，另籌抵補，何必掮出這些好聽的名月來，教持異議的人，甘冒破壞，摧殘的名義。其三，用款機關，不宜逕收逕支。此事流弊最大，冒濫最多。在會計獨立，審計獨國的今日，似乎可能性甚少。但事實上則到處可見。</p>
<p>要整飭吏治，减少民眾的痛苦，莫念於整頓財政。要整領財政，當然應從改善私制，汰除不合理的我率，稅目入手。故對於陳參議員等的建議，我們寄以熱切的同情。</p>

<h3>漢市改隸問題揷曲　市參會與省府一場爭執</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口訊〕漢市改隸問題，引起市參會與省府間一無謂爭執，雙方竟由口角而至筆戰。緣漢市參議會開幕之日（十六）參議員胡文輝在答詞中，抨擊省府反對漢市改院轄市問題，並責萬主席亂作主張，當時在座代表萬主席出席之余廳長正東。尚未作任何表示，事後因記者訪問，始說這位參議員未免態度失當，因而激起全體議員憤怒，聯名致函余廳長，請求解釋「失態二字」，省府發言人亦發表書而談話，略謂：關於漢口市改院轄市問題，應由中央決定，市議會自可按照其組織條例，向同級政府建議，　轉中央核　，省政府亦可向中央陳述其意見，以供採揷。此次漢市參議會開幕，胡參議員竟在致答詞中，以「疾言厲色」，「怒髮衝冠」之態度，與　罵之口吻，謂省府「看法糊塗」，並　訊萬主席，「今後對於湖北之政治，經濟，文化，交通，多下功夫研究，少作不必要之主張」，可見純係義氣用事。至市參議會致函代表省主席之余廳長，請解釋「失態」二字一節，市參議會依法對省府既無質詢之權，且其行文手續，復與行政院三十四年戌養午一敬代電之規定不合，自無答復之必要云云。此亦可謂民主聲中之一小小波瀾也。</p>

<h3>英國通牒限期今晚屆滿　阿爾巴尼亞提覆文　南否認以水雷供給阿國</h3>

<h3>波蘭答覆英照會　責英國違背諾言　兩國間摩擦一時未易消除</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華沙廿二日電〕英政府會於十一月廿二日郵牒波蘭政府，要求保證明年一月十九日之選舉自由。今日波蘭代理外長以覆照交予英駐波大使貝恩丁，其中反責英國違背對波蘭應盡之義務。按英國之照會中，曾對波蘭將來舉行選舉時，能否遵重耶爾達及波茨坦協定爲慮。而波關之覆文中則謂，保證自由選舉一節，不惟在耶爾達與波茨坦協定中提及，即在彼蘭憲法巾亦明文予以規定也。覆文中並指出英國在若千方面，未能履行對波蘭所作之保證，深表遣憾，而對下列列列兩點尤爲重視：（一）當倫敦波蘭流亡政府解散後，英政府依然准許波蘭流亡份子進行遊擊活動，並保留其國外之代表。（二）波蘭善後工作團係在英國成立，而爲波蘭當局權力所不及，英國仍將波蘭若干數量之黃金扣留，不然波蘭之復興工作當能加速。而英政府識時所獲取之波蘭船隻，至今仍未歸還原主。波蘭政府希望英政府能更進一步，恪守其所作之保證云。</p>
<p>英再闡釋態度</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿一日電〕今已知英波交換照會結果，並未能使華沙保證將來依英方所希望之條件而舉行選舉。關於波蘭指責英政府之各項，頃經英官方說明態度如下：（一）前倫敦之波關政府並未得英方之財政援助，其人員所享之言諭結社等自由，與英境其他居民相等。（二）英政府己允諾決不强迫不願返國之波蘭士兵返國，盟軍逗留國外不願返國之情形固亦甚多。（三）至於編制勞務隊一點，此乃根據英國法律而訓練民兵之事。（四）英波間於今年夏季己識定解決波蘭戰債之協定，英政府之迄未批准該一協定，以及扣留彼蘭在英黃金及資金，純係由於波蘭不願履行諾言以舉行公允而自由的選舉之故。至於波軍士兵遣送返國之遲緩，則係因波政府不能供給各士兵詳細記録之故。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社馬德里廿二日電〕外傳弗朗哥西班牙與阿刺伯國家已成立協定，同意西屬麼洛哥實行自治云云，今日西班牙官方人士則謂對於此事毫無所知。但中立之觀察家稱，弗朗哥對居留於西班牙地帶之摩洛哥人，可能提出若干諾諾言，謀使阿刺伯國家在聯合國大會中表決西班牙問題時，採取中立態度。但承認目下一如欲獲一結論，則時機尚未成熟。據悉，西班牙駐麼洛哥專員伐華拉最近會准許慶洛哥智識份子三人，前往開羅，俾與阿刺伯聯盟在文化上發生初步之接觸。此一姿態，旨在表示弗則哥之善意，因其深信此三代表之活動將限於文化方面，才致涉及政治也。但據馬德里消息靈通人士訊：此三代表之活動，竟超越訓令之範圍，而使西政府處於窘境云，同時，西班牙共和國流亡份子利用摩洛哥國民運動派之支持，開會保證一俟西班牙恢復共和國，將立即准許西屬摩洛哥自治。因此種種傳說，更見紛紜矣。</p>

<h3>法擬縮减　陸軍數量</h3>
<p>目下兵力六十五萬人</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿一日電〕法國雖以名列四強自豪，然在勃魯姆總理之經濟計劃中，其兵力或將减至與第二或第三等國家相仿。馬奇諾與齊格斐防綫已成過去，德國沿海防禦，自奧斯陸至波爾多，已盡遭炸毀。法國兵力六十五萬人，包括憲兵，陸戰隊及空軍在內，在歐洲大陸上除蘇聯外，僅次於南斯拉夫。據諜報方面可靠估計，南斯拉夫爲今日歐洲各小國中最堅强之國家，其兵力達八十萬人。目前法國經濟計劃，主張减少軍隊。如有陸軍三十萬人，約可與弗朗哥政府之西班牙軍隊相寺，亦可相當於此科時或荷蘭所能召集之置隊。勃魯姆於上週擬組聯合政府，即因軍事問題而未能成立。法國共產及人民共和兩大黨，對於何人担任國防部長，意見未能一致。共黨非獲國防一席，不願參加勃魯姆內閣，人民共和黨則拒絕與以考慮，據稱共黨將以第五縱隊破壞法國陸軍。因此勃魯姆不得不以少數黨組識淸一色社會黨內閣，保證節省經濟，而由减少公務人員與軍隊入手。</p>

<h3>班迪特夫人演說　盛讚我所持立場　謂聯大工作頗爲成功　嚴厲指責英代表態度</h3>
<p>〔中央社新德里二十一日電〕印度出席聯大會代表團長班迪特夫人，今晚在印度國際問題研究會所主持之公費大會上演說稱：「吾人在聯大及委員會上獲得中國之强有力支持，中國代表顧維鈞博士曾爲吾人多次投票出席該會者有尼赫魯·格佛（即邊疆甘地）·我駐印代辦薛壽衡·我赴尼泊爾訪問團長沈宗濂·及美駐印專員梅利爾等人。班迪特夫人演說詳論印度代表在聯大會上得到其他國家代表之合作一事，渠頗稱讚渠所稱爲「斯拉夫集團」諸國所予印度之合作，渠最强調蘇聯及波關二團對即之合作。渠論及中國之簡短而特出之言詞，乃表明印度代表在大會上自東方諸國獲得支持係意料中事，渠之所以特別對顧維鈞博士表示惑謝者，乃在指明中國在大會上對印度或亞洲之提案予以支特係極有力者。渠以爲美國代表對印度提案不能合作之原因，係由於美國外交政策之「混亂」。渠對於英代表國長在大會上所爲，表示不悅。論及聯合團組織本身時，渠以爲聯合國組織雖有其弱點，然未來國際方面之爭執，必將由其解決，渠特指出五强之否決權乃屬必要，蓋「盎格魯撒克遜」國家及其衛星國佔絕大多數也。</p>
<p>〔路透社新德里廿一日電〕聯大會議印度首席代表班迪特夫人今夜發表談話稱：印度代表團向聯合國大會提出之各項意見，悉遭英國破壞，雖被其破壞之技巧極爲秘密而聰明，但仍不能欺朦明眼人。印度代表團此次得與各亞洲國家代表取得密切接觸，深爲幸運，僅土耳其代表曾向余表示土國對歐亞均不發生興趣，參加聯合國僅爲充數而已。夫人機謂：印度在聯大中戰勝南菲，實爲聯合國機構之成功。今日印度已博得世界之同情，吾人於獲得完全自由後，必能迅速進步，預料在短期內可能超過蘇聯今日之地位。</p>

<h3>犯罪兇器　網羅無遺　警察博物館定元旦成立</h3>

<h3>戰時廠商損失登記　調查工作需時必多</h3>

<h3>毛毯日配四百條　公教人員抱向隅</h3>
<p>本市公教人員毛毯之配售，業於廿一日開始，由公教人員物品配售處發售，每條價四萬五千五百元，憑宙字號配售印花繳款取貨，惟行政院物資供應局每日限制供應四百條，以致後至者皆抱向隅。全市公教人員向配售處登記領證者，有八萬餘人，若物資供應局常此每日限制四百條，勢必遷延至明年六七月方可全部配售完畢。聞廿一日請配者過於擁擠，物資供應局增配四百條，然杯水車薪，仍屬無濟於事。方今天寒地凍，毛毯之需要正殷，故一般公教人員，咸望物資供應局能大量供應，於年內趕配完竣，以適應實際之需要。</p>

<h3>義和輪抗戰犧牲　威金遜追贈少校</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕英商怡和公司義和輸，係行駛川江宜渝綫之淺水輪，總噸僅七百〇七噸，船長一百七十呎。一九四一年，被徵列列列人海軍，改爲巡邏兵艦，於是年二月十四日下午四時，在新加坡海面，艦長威金遜，遙見日武裝運輪船二隊，的一一十五艘，由日驅逐艦及大號巡洋艦各一艘護送，義和艦前已與日機一度惡戰，艦身略受微傷，該艦長威金遜仍　不　身，在距敵運輪船艦八千碼時，發砲猛轟，當有敵大運輪船一艘命中，立即焚燒沉沒。義和艦亦卒被敵巡洋艦擊沉，全艦獲救者僅十餘人，艦長威金遜與艦同時殉職。英政府對該艦長威金遜勳續可嘉，於本月十七日追贈海軍少校，並頒維多利亞十字勳軍（按該勳章爲英國最高軍功勳軍），本市該公司得悉後，亦對該艦長之義烈，一致表示追念。</p>
<h3>聖誕樹今昔　最大主顧是外僑　大都回故鄉了</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕在戰前，齊葱悅目裝璜美　的聖　樹，在這個佳節中的消耗最是很大的，只是在靜安寺路這個小區城內，估計在兩千枝以上。太平祥戰學發生之後，盟邦僑胞令體在集中營中過着苦難的生活，聖誕樹的需要量爲之說减。但是在去年之今日，解放之鐘聲饗了，聖誕節帶給市民安慰與希望。「和平降臨火地，人們以善意相見」。市民在在歡的情調巾，享受這個佳節。英美僑民起出集巾營。初到上海的美國海軍，把戰時所儲蓄的薪水，儘量在這個「東方巳黎」的市塲上化　。　　權的營業也還景氣，靜安寺路一帶，大的銷出一千多顆。</p>
<p>流光如矢，轉瞬又是一年，佳節有將來臨，經營花葉的，看了去年的情景，事先已大作準備。他們不惜工本的從率化，寗波，湖州一帶去搜集聖　樹，運來上海出售·大致的說，聖誕樹可分一十一種：頂好的是紫杉，來自奉化寗波，經過巧妙的化裝以後，最大的售價到十八萬至二十萬，普通的也得賣到七八萬。次等的是杉木，亦從　化等地運來，好的賣五六萬，普通的賣二三萬。圾普通的是本地出產的刺柏，一一一萬元就可以買到。點綴盟誕節的花卉，亦以各種逗人愛憐的姿態出現，價格自二一萬至七八萬不等，主顧大多是些外國女人。</p>
<p>今天聖誕樹的賣買景氣嗎？這些花商的勞力會白費嗎？這個問題要到本月二十五日後，方有正確的答覆。不過從事證一業的，多少有些不幸的預感。首先，聖誕樹的最大顧主是外國人，可是現在這些富有的英美僑民，大都在故鄉安度佳節，他們都在上海經過生命上最大的風險，或許對於上海减少了留戀。美國在華的海軍，大部己在靑島，留在上海的是少數，而且也並不實有。以國人而論，教會中人畢究是少數，而且在這個年頭，市面　條，首業不景氣，老板們在打算如何應付年賞，伙計們在考慮如何　債，對於聖誕節的與趣，比以往是低得多。同時物力　難，節約爲上，所以聖　樹生意很可能不如去年。不過，也有些不可知的因素，例如新近取　蘇聯國籍的白我們，正在興高采烈，假這個聖誕　　自己的運　呢！</p>
<h3>海關加緊緝私工作　輪船進口　三道防綫</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市漏稅走私，情形嚴重，海關方面，對於緝私工作，雖在加緊准行，但市上仍不時有私貨發現。據悉：目前上海大多數走私物品，係先在吳淞口外，由輸上投人海中，再由小船運往吳淞轉運來滬。</p>
<p>走私漏稅殊非易事</p>
<p>記者爲此特往訪江海關負責人探詢詳情，承告此或係過去之情形，在今日恐不可能。蓋外洋貨物，由輪船裝載來滬，必須經三道關口。（一）吳淞口外有江海關之大船一艘，畫夜來往查緝。（二）吳淞口設有關口，派副稅務司常駐負責查緝，另有船舶一一艘協助工作。（三）黃浦江面經常有船艇往來防範，故欲偷過此三關，當非易事。且海關方面早有規定，凡在本國海岸綫十二海里內往來之各項船隻，經海關巡船發出各種信號，囑令停駛，聽候檢查，並不遵命時，即放空砲警告，如苒抗命，即可向該運令船隻實彈射擊。但亦並非欲將該船擊沉，僅指毀其桅桿機件等，使之不能行駛而已。最近海關方面，接獲行政院命令，爲加強查緝工作起見，暫行借調海軍艦艇，由關員駐艦，從事查緝。</p>
<h3>京滬長途電話　訂定特快辦法</h3>
<p>交通部上海電信局近爲便利長途電話用戶起見，已定廿五日零時起，開放特快電話。其辦法如决：（一）接通時間不足十分鐘。（二）價目照加急電話雙倍計算。（三）暫開放呌號電話。（四）每一電話限通話兩次。（五）開放地點暫定滬兩地。（六）用戶掛發特快電話，須於掛號時預爲說明。並悉其他各地特快電話，一俟裝置工竣，亦將陸續開放。</p>
<h3>軍械庫爆炸案　昨日繼續偵訊</h3>
<p>江灣第二軍械庫第一分庫爆炸案，昨日雖爲星期例例例假，但偵詢工作，並未停止·各有關人員，仍繼續審詢中。惟因醫備司令部例假休息，價詢地點，暫移狄思威路警備部　查處滬東稽查所內。下午二時起，開始提有關人員詢問，計被傳提訊者，有在押之第一補給區司令軍械處課長　　之等奪人。因　不僅爲軍械庫之主管科長，更爲分庫長王仁珊之保證人，刻王畏罪潛逃，鄧當負相當責任。主持偵審者，與前日相同，爲國防部軍法處主任軍法官包啟黃，滬東稽查所副所長嚴滋，及書記官盛兀泉。外傳秦德純次長亦參加偵審，實屬不確。又據中央社記者向有關方面探悉，昨日被傳詢者，尚有秦壽榆一名。　秦原爲第二軍械庫第一分庫代理庫長，前以盜賣軍械，查出後即予扣押論處。最近由國防部批覆，判處有期徒刑十年，業已送監執行。該秦壽榆撤職後，繼任分庫長者，即爲王仁珊，任職未久，適發生此次爆炸案件，此次秦之提監審詢，當在情理中云。諸案審理工作，今起仍在警備部軍事法。</p>
<h3>商邱路米店劫案　銀行守得綫索　輾轉拘獲盜犯　另一盜於犯案後已逃往南京</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕十七日下午滬東商邱路三七〇號老大昌米號，突遭盜劫，曾略誌昨日本報，茲再將詳情誌次：該號於是日下午五時許，忽來盜匪兩名，一着草黃色軍服執手槍，一衣玄色短衫褲，持手榴彈二二枚，侵入號中，禁止聲張，由穿軍服者監視號中夥友，令便服者在臥房及口搜計劫去法幣二十八萬元，浙業銀行支票一紙票面十二萬四千元，並夥友王承基及店主婦手上金戒各一只。仍由前門逸去，翌日下午四時卅分，店主沈裕章由鄉返滬，始向提籃橋警局報案。該分局長張人佑因時隔一日，追緝較難，乃不動聲色，飭第二股長馬祝玉秘密偵查。二十一日選派便衣警士袁啟泰，孫鴻賓在浙江興　銀行守候。比至上午十一時許，果有泰康洋服店學徒諸文達，携該支票來銀行十九號　合兌款。當將其帶局，供稱：係彼胞姊諸麗菊交伊提取。後將能麗菊拘案，據供，乃住居西安路木棚之堂紀泉抵付　之債務，並不知該支票來源。當派警長　運星，警士齊少農，陸殿要，按址前往拘獲盜犯唐紀泉一名，抄獲日本式手槍一支，子彈七十一發，手榴彈二枚，尚有間黨一名，乃一退伍軍人，（該武器均爲彼所有），已於劫後次日，赴南京訪友。刻警局仍在嚴密　緝中。</p>
<h3>不良份子特種職業　轉向曾任偽職者索詐　被害人有張桐律師等</h3>

<h3>從膏方說到國藥</h3>
<p>說到冬令進補，當然要提及膏滋藥。本來國藥店的營業，夏季忙而冬季賺錢，錢就賺在這膏滋藥的營業上。因爲膏滋藥中，有許多是名貴的藥物，像人參，鹿茸之類，而收膏的時候，必須用　皮膠龜板膠，亦爲珍品。今年市價，一服膏滋藥恐非四五十萬元不辦，藥店的利息素厚，假使能多接得幾張膏方，不是可以快快樂樂地過年了慶？</p>
<p>國藥，除了少數採用動物和礦物外，大都是植物，產地分佈令國，而以川滇黔貴各省的出產爲最多。國藥還有一種特質，即甲地所產，與乙地所產，藥性不同，故國藥店標榜着「道地藥材」四字，表明產地無錯。各地藥材，由生藥行向產地採辦，藥店則向生藥行批發。藥材批進後，尚須製治，「遵古法泡製」的招牌，由此而來。但許多小藥店，往往來不及用古法泡製往往「馬虎」了事。</p>
<p>全市國藥店·共四百餘家</p>
<p>歷史最悠久的是姜衍澤，己二百餘年。胡慶餘堂是民國後由杭州分設至此，但規模與營業，上海藥店却誰都比不上他。無論那裏一種貴重藥材，冷僻丸散，他是不會沒有的。至於徐重道的分店，遍及全滬，又是一種作風·一個藥店職員，要知道上千種的草藥，上千種的丸散膠丹，不是內行是不能應付的，所以大都爲學徒出身。在小藥店中，一個職貝，什麼事都要做，至多不過分爲丸散和餘片二部·可是在大藥舖中，則各有專職，切片的稱爲刀上先生，小抽斗中裝藥的稱爲夾斗房，製造丸散，亦有人專司其職。像規模極大的胡慶餘堂，有五大房六小房的名目：飲片房，丸散房，細料房，大料房，刀房則屬於大房，揀藥房，莊計房，細膏房，細貨房，草藥房，貨房屬於小房，全部職工，約共三百餘人。</p>
<p>賣去一兩·批進一斤</p>
<p>開藥店是一種好買賣，所謂「大秤買進，小秤買出。」他們的利潤，是非常可觀的，普通成本一千元的藥，賣三千五千是很平常的事，有幾種藥，賣去一兩，就可以批進一斤，這是什麼利子。不過他們賣得如此之貴，也有他們的苦衷，有許多冷僻貴重的藥，往往歷四五年尚無人問津的，同同同時每年黃梅時節，藥材要壞却許多，所以不得不如此。這是指大藥店而言，小藥店貴重藥不會備得多，霉壞的藥，揀後再行出售，所以到小藥店巾去配方，便宜不少，現在同業公會雖劃一售價，但在折扣上，小藥店仍比較大一些。</p>
<p>代客煎藥</p>
<p>代客煮藥是徐重道所發明的。過去許多大藥舖中，神氯傲慢，到現在仍不肯代客煮藥。但膏滋藥素來由藥店代煮，甚至把紫銅鍋，炭爐，榨床等挑到你府上，當面煮鰲，以示慎重。膏滋藥的煮法和普通的藥不同同同，藥量旣多，還要分別藥性，加以泡渡，煮的時候，那幾味先煮，那幾味後下，多少時間用武火煮，多少時間用文火煮，都有講究。允其是最後「收膏」的一個階段，如何用阿膠，那時放冰糖，不能隨使。一個不會煮藥的人，簡直不知如何把這滿滿的一大鍋藥材煮成小小一磁缸，平白地把許多貴重的藥品浪費了。好在膏滋藥是藥舖裏的好賣買，所以不惜移尊就教，代爲煮熬。</p>
<p>北平成藥·馳譽全國</p>
<p>國藥中有許多成藥，是很有名的，像雷允上的六神丸，銷至日本南洋各埠，每年營業甚巨，其他如胡慶俆堂之辟瘟丹，童涵春之再造丸，均爲著名成藥，前北平宏仁堂開幕之日，售出阿膠竟達六十担，成藥中之補品亦不少，如百補膏，金鹿丸等，均帶有滋補性質。北平成藥，素來馳譽全國，有夏鐵英者，創高北平藥局，專售北平成藥，其中補劑如九天大補膏，九九還童酎等，銷路退好，惜不久即即即停業矣。</p>
<p>藥一弄錯，攸關人命。在上海有幾回因配錯了藥，或兩家的藥掉錯了，輕者誤病，重者喪生。事後給病家從藥渣裏查得了證據，於是訴諸於法。結果藥店暗中挽人出來，賠償了事，這是藥店中的無形損失，但若眞由法院偵查調驗，藥店未必應負全責，不過張楊出去，有關藥店信譽。所以在報紙上所能見到的，祇是極少數而己。</p>
<p>有許多藥店，爲了生意起見，請醫生在店中附設診所。有幾家小藥店，紙有容膝之地，居然也掛上「國醫×××診所」的招牌。在房荒的今日，醫生當然落得借個現成地方設診，藥店也可多做些生意。所謂「船帮水，水帮船」是也。還有許多小藥店，聯絡生意淸淡的醫生，實行送診辦法，病人旣受送診之愚，當然不會向別家去買藥了。</p>
<p>現在科學的醫藥性很流行，可是國藥舖的營業，仍不生多大影響。但看人家一日千里地進步，而國藥舖仍故步自封，不免是前途的障礙。生藥原料每年運銷海外者不少，提懷精製後，再輪入中國，這是莫大的漏厄。同時國藥中有許多特效成藥，其　往往秘而不宣，終於失傳，運也是很可惜的事情。經營國藥業者，函應注意。</p>
<p>萬壑松風下之鹿羣</p>
<h3>西藥中的補品</h3>
<p>在科學醫藥開始輪入時，中國人是不大信任的，即是現在，大都市裏，還有許多人仍念念不忘於我們的「國故」——國醫和國藥。西藥中的補品，最先受國人歡迎的，是魚肝油，賣的「解百勒」魚肝油，會盛行一時。迨後「維太命」發現，更使人覺得新奇。許多補汁，補丸，先後爲國人所採用。</p>
<p>滬上西藥業，以光緒六年英商所設立大英藥房開其端，至光緒三十年，大英藥房職員　松泉，集資創設中西藥房於　州路，此爲華人經營新藥業之濫　，當時獲利頗豐，於是各外商藥房之華　職員，紛紛自行設店經營，先後有中法，華英，中英，五洲等藥房。其時藥房雖多，而營業不受影響，每年有利可岡。</p>
<p>最初經營西藥，純爲販賣性質。民國以後，幾家規模較大者，試行設廠自製，如五洲藥房的人造自來血，中法藥房的仁丹，過去都有其歷史與地位。及經營者漸多，營業範圍亦漸蹙，照相材料，　爲專營照相業者奪去，化裝品亦由廣生行家庭工業社等佔去來牟，牙醫器械，更爲齒科商人所數持。同時同業間之競爭，至爲劇烈，西歐名廠成藥，售價竟有不及成本者。西藥至此，外強中乾之象，已漸暴露。</p>
<p>製造新藥　獲利倍蓰</p>
<p>在西藥業凋零時期，各藥房乃注意於製造，因販賣成藥利淵旣微，甚至有虧本之虞，不如製造新藥，所獲或可倍蓰。於是紛紛仿製歐美成藥，藉以牟利。更有專門製藥之廠出現。例如新亞藥廠，本製化粧品，九一八後，即改製各種針藥。十九年，德商經營之誼藥廠，亦由國人接辦，其他小藥廠，亦多如雨後春筍。</p>
<p>製造新藥，大都仍仿歐美成方，圾初僅擇較　單者，漸次而及性質複雜之藥。最後又創製新藥，允注意於國藥原料，加以精製，例如民生藥廠之安嗽露，即合國藥中之達志桔梗川貝杏仁等品而成者。此種情形，似爲新藥萊之一大進步。年來國人對於西藥之信仰漸增，服用西藥者亦漸多，新藥業本可蒸蒸日上。無如科學落後，國產西藥雖巳不少，但有許多製成品，仍敵不過舶來物，特效藥，更非仰賴輪入不可，德國之拜耳，先靈，怡默克，美國之禮來，普強，派德，英國之寳威等出品，在上海市塲上，仍佔極大勢力。</p>
<p>補品種類·不勝枚舉</p>
<p>西藥中之補品，種類繁多，不勝枚舉。早年流行之補劑，增強血液之運連行，促推新陳代謝之功能，大都爲鐵質製劑，國產之人造自來血即屬此類。其後又利用動物內臟，以補益人體各部，如內分泌製成之荷爾蒙，牛肝製成之肝膏等是。臟器療法，在中國醫藉中，本已論及，但不科學化，西人以科學方法改良之，遂成爲效力最大之補品。而化學療法進步，製成補品更多，如多種維他命之類流行亦廣。</p>
<p>較通俗之補品，爲魚肝油。魚肝油由　魚肝臟練製而成，挪威北部產量最豐。北歐民間已很早採作食料，兼爲醫治療　政關節炎之用。至十八世紀，始知魚肝油能治佝僂症與肺結核。一九二六年，發現魚肝油含有維他命丁，故能治肺結核，於是魚肝油之生產，製造，消費愈廣，與肺結核病遂結不解之　，最近又發現魚肝油有阻止細菌發育之功，不單是肺結核菌，即化膿菌嫌氣菌也受其影響。</p>
<p>魚肝油是一種流動性的脂肪，色帶淡黃，補力雖大，但腥臭異常，許多人不能下咽。母親們強迫小孩子去服，小孩子聞其腥臭幾乎會哭出來。因此有人設法將別的東西調和起來，减少腥臭，滋味較美，麥精魚肝油和乳白魚肝油就是這樣製成的。最後更進一步，將魚肝油提煉成精，或製成丸藥，則更便利了。</p>
<p>我國藥房中所出售的魚肝油，大都從外洋原桶輸入，再加包裝調製，精製品巾，如信誼的好力生，新亞的海力命，其成分功效，均不下於舶來品。</p>
<p>維他命在今日已成爲家喻戶曉的名詞，大家都知道是主要營養份子。但如談到到到類別，成分，以及對於人體關係等等，好多人就不知道了。維他命之發明者，爲英國劍橋之凱雪曼爾盟克，在食米殼中，分離得預防脚氣病之物質，認爲是阿命（Armine）之一種，因與人體有關，乃名之爲維他命。</p>
<p>普謂謂維他命分甲·乙·丙·丁·戊五種，實際上從化學成分，及對於人體功效來說，尚不如此商單。但維他命並不是一種特異東西，一般食物中均有，假使平時在飲食上，加以注意，營養已很足，維他命也不會缺乏。不過食物中的維他命，常因烹煮而喪失，或因腐敗而破壞，所以有維他命不足的病徽。醫藥界乃設法提煉維他命，以作治療之用。然據醫界中人言，多服維他命，也有流弊，不可不知。</p>
<p>大戰期間</p>
<p>在這次大戰期間，各國因糧食缺乏，前綫士兵，有營義不足之患，而維他命爲對抗因營養不足而誘發的病症之主要武器，故紛紛製造，產量以美國爲最多，一九四四年所製成之維他命，已值四千七百萬美元，大戰結束後，美國維他命之貿易額更巨。</p>
<p>在抗戰期間，西藥來源受阻，滬市藥商，競相囤積，幾種特效藥，便奇貨可居，製藥廠也因市場需要，賺錢不少。勝利以後，美貨藥品，由DDT作先鋒，大量運來，如維他命丸等，五步一人，十步一　，沿街呌賣，以致國產品銷路呆滯。自購買太平洋島上美軍剩餘物資的消息傳出後，更使藥商們惴惴不安。瞻望西藥業的前途，可謂危機重軍”外貨充斥，開支浩繁，現在大部分已是陷於半開工狀態，要挽救這嚴重局面，仍須大家努力。</p>
<h3>氣象預測</h3>

<h3>看護小姐副業　業餘替人打針</h3>
<p>「出門注射，靜脈肌肉各種補針，電××號×小姐。」</p>
<p>在本市日報的分類廣告中，常常可以發現這一類性質的廣告，短短的兩三行，點綴共間，也算是上海特有的一種營業。</p>
<p>冬令進補，補針因效力大，人所樂用。但注射針藥是一種專門技能，一般人自己不能動手，必須請教護士們，於是這種專門注射補針的職業，應運而生。她們是護士或助產士，具有醫藥知識，大都還在各醫院中供職。在生活高昂的今日，醫院中的待遇也許不足以維持生活，不得不另外想法，我點額外收入，所以利用她們業餘時間，替人打針。</p>
<p>不要小看這簡單輕易的工作，忙的時時候，一個冬季下來，收入也很可觀。現在皮下和肌肉注射，普通每次三四千元，注射補針，總要數十針，不是也有十數萬元的進益麼？不過在風雪中奔走，也够苦的。同時現在市區交通困難，所費時間也不少。遠的地方，還得要付出一筆相當大的車費。</p>
<h3>參茸燕耳</h3>
<p>人參</p>
<p>人參號稱補品之王，因其形肖人，故稱爲人參，以產於吉林及烏蘇里江一帶爲最佳，東北有句土語：「東三省，三件寶，人參，鹿茸，烏拉草。」除烏拉草外，均爲補品，而人參更爲名貴。</p>
<p>人參產於老山之林木深處，但又不可爲樹蔭遮蔽，必須得日光　射之處方能生長。他的生長過程，可分爲六個時期，一年至五年，生一掌狀葉，俗名「把掌子」，五年至十年，生　葉，各爲「二來十」，二十年生三葉，稱「三台子」，三十年生四葉，名「四品葉」，由三十年而四十年而五十年，又由五十年而六十年，至生齊六葉爲止，綫算長成。年齡達六十歲之人參，己很名貴，如果土內之根，頭尾肢體其全，更可善價而沽。初生之業，作嫩綠色，滿百齡，　漸黃，五百年之人參，葉作嫩黃色，滿千年之人參，轉爲老黃色，華鮮紅，極罕見。</p>
<p>人參採掘不易，採參者大都於八九月間，結隊入山，約二十人爲一組，相隔各百步，互相呼應，携帶武器，以防盜匪野獸。採參之人，須在千花百卉中，覓尋參苗，故必須有特殊經驗者方能辦此。若發現參苗，便大呼「棒棰」，以紅綫縛之，舖上油布，伏而掘之，掘時用牛角鍫或棗木鏟，因金萬物觸及根部，精華將散也。關根部三尺外，掘去泥土，愈掘態近，及見有金黃色泥土時，即用手輕輕將泥土爬鬆，然後一手取參，一手提苗，同時出土。若一日不能竣事，則守而不去，須待全參取出，陳列祭品，叩謝山神，如所得爲六品葉之大參，則須用全羊上祭。</p>
<p>人參是一種強壯劑，在本草上，極佔重要地位。但很勢利，祗與富貴人家結緣。凡富貴人家害病，非此不可，諸虛百損皆可服，溫而不燥，補而不熱，這些都是使人歡迎的口號。我們看到戰前城內鹹瓜街對衡望宇的參號，其威風氣概足使窮人望而却步。</p>
<p>鹿茸</p>
<p>鹿是够美麗的，週身長着光瀾的褐黃色絨毛，還隔雜着一圈圈潔白的斑點。頭上一對修長的歧角，頗如舊戲中狀元紗帽上所插着的一校花。無怪他在池邊飲水的時候，照見他的影子，要得意忘形了。又有許多人認爲鹿是有仙氣的，他那飄飄然樣兒，的確沒有一點塵俗之氣。正因爲他那一副仙風道骨，所以常被人把他作爲點綴園林之物，淸代在熱河行宮內所家養的鹿，數以千計，在萬壑松風下，看他奔馳，眞令人有出塵之想。</p>
<p>鹿祇有雄的有角，雌鹿是沒有的。幼鹿的角，初生如芽，有皮覆在上面，皮腫之處像生輩，這就是藥品中有名的鹿茸。鹿茸生在腦上，沐浴陽光，故巾現紅色血華。性極熱，功能補陽，有枯楊生梯之效。產於東北者稱爲關東鹿，更爲名貴，在昔日乃是王公大臣　緣時的媒介物，官塲中的上色禮品。</p>
<p>我們將鹿茸認爲名貴補品，一般歐洲人都引以爲異，但這却引起了他們的好奇心。游聯內分泌學專家巴夫倫柯教授，研究鹿茸的化學，生物學，藥物學很久，搜集了許多鹿頭來做試驗，結果曉得中國人的用藥並沒有錯。鹿茸裏面含有極豐富的男性生殖腺，對於人身確是極好的補劑。但我們服乾鹿茸粉，補的成分已散失了，於是他便製成液劑或服或皮下注射，效用更來得大，特別關於性的虛弱，最見功效。　國藥店中，鹿的用處甚多。除了珍貴的鹿茸以外，整個的身體，都可入藥。因此大藥店中，常自己養着鹿。杭州胡慶餘堂有一鹿　，供人瀏覽，上海有幾家藥店，偶然得到一只鹿，也要放在天井裏常作一塊活招脾。殺鹿之時，更不可隨便，先要揀個黃道吉時，把很好的食料，餵給鹿吃，然後再燃起名香巨燭，由店主，經理，豢鹿和殺鹿的工人，向鹿禮拜，表示一種不忍之心，可見他們的慎重。</p>
<p>燕窩</p>
<p>燕窩產於南洋一帶，爲金絲燕所營之巢。金絲燕大者如鳥，構巢於斷崖峭壁之上，形如海棉，排列無序。其窩乃取海藻黏成，作窩時，先將海藻吞入胃中，經胃液醞釀，而後吐出，遂成膠質。一說爲燕口中所分泌之黏液，因金絲燕啖魚時，口涎流於海上洞穴之間，爲冬日退毛時食品，久之乃結成爲窩。</p>
<p>每屆燕窩採集之期，土人携器具，備糧食，結隊前往。採集至爲艱難，常垂繩於海岸之上，危巖峭壁之間，長數百尺，繁登懸崖，始能獲得，年老力弱者，得墮崖而死。担任此項工作者，都爲當地土人，攀援上下，至爲輕捷。迨升至高處，手　懸崖凹處，遠望細若蒼蠅。窩附於海岸上，採時應手即下，墮於烏黃之上，故多完整。同伴見之，將窩拾起，拭去烏糞，携之出洞。</p>
<p>燕窩以遏邏所產者最爲上品，南貨店的市招上，往往特標「暹羅官燕」四個大字，以資誇耀。暹邏經營燕窩者，皆爲華僑，華僑中因業此而致富者，數亦不少。經營之法，先貸款於土人，迨土人採得燕窩後，再隨時送交。</p>
<p>燕窩以顏色潔白者爲上，即所謂官燕是也。羽毛交雜，黑色而有血痕者，稱爲毛燕。乃灰白色之細條所組成，浸水則柔歡漲大，丙多膠質，故富滋養。醫書上說：能滋陰降火，消痰止咳，淸肺補身，久服延年益壽，故視爲珍貴補品。富貴之家，以燕窩充補品，上等筵席，亦有以燕窩爲主菜者，過去曾有一度，禁用魚翅，燕菜席遂流行一時。</p>
<p>銀耳</p>
<p>素稱爲天府之國的四川，有話多特產，極受人珍視，尤其銀耳一項，最稱滋補。銀耳產於川西川北各地，萬源，通江，廣元，逐寗等縣所產，旣多且佳，貴州也有出產，但總不如川中所產者好。</p>
<p>銀耳乃黑木耳之變相，川人經營黑木耳者，每年初夏購買「靑扛標樹」，鋸成三四尺之段木，稱爲筒子，置於山陰溫濕之處，不久生黑木耳，隨生隨鏟，晒乾出售。有時段木突變，產生銀耳，價格固可十倍黑木耳，但旣生一次，以後即不再生，段太變爲廢物，以木力一次拔盡也。段木成本甚高，故經營宮此業者，如產銀耳，反認爲不幸。現川人己知選擇特殊樹木，爲專產銀耳之用　春秋兩季，常銀耳產生旺盛時，每隔三五天，即採取一次。携歸後，去其壞者，剪去根脚，在近山淸泉中洗爭，再行揀選，然後用竹籤或麻綫貫穿成串，置於灶上烘焙，火須強烈，但無烟氣，烤的四五小時，不使焦黃，否則則則未免遜色。大的新鮮銀耳五十兩，烘乾以後，祇剩一兩，其難得可想而知。</p>
<p>銀耳功能治血虛，心腎兩虧，身體孱弱等症，即很難治的肺病·據說吃了銀耳，也有很顯著的功效·不過銀耳性潤，身體肥胖而患濕痰者，似乎不大相宜。依其名稱，當然以顏色潔白者爲佳，選擇時，圓大如核桃，質地淸白者·川人稱爲「泡子銀耳」。作偽者常以碎銀耳置器皿中，酒以糯米湯汁·漸簸漸滾，至凝結時，也圓而大，似泡子，但體質稍重，內行人一　而知其是　品。</p>

<h3>抑平物價取締囤積　社局決採斷然措置　民生必需品存底極充沛　操縱物價市民可以檢舉</h3>
<p>近日本市物價，受黃金飛漲之刺激，相繼暴昇，影饗民生至爲深鉅，市社會局以職責所在，決予嚴厲抑止，據該局負責人談：日來本市物價一日數漲，本局已予密切注意，今可奉告市民者，食米·食油·食糖等民生必需品，本市存底極爲充沛，且來　暢通，決無巾斷之虞，本局爲謀抑平物優安定民生起見，現決採取斷然措施，對奸商操縱物價及囤積物資者，決予嚴懲，毫不寬貸，本局於今日起，將於市塲內拋售大量食米，以謀抑止漲風，並巳函請合　糖等公司及中國植物油料廠，於今日起無限制拋售食糖及食汕，故米·糠·油等價格，今明必常低落，至於燃料問題，煤斤來源已甚暢通，一二日內即可有鴻　煤屑六千五百噸抵滬，最近撫順煤礦，亦可有白煤一萬噸來滬，故民生用煤，無　缺乏，其價值可不抑自平，至於火油最近在奸商喪心病在之操縱下，售價飛漲，本局現決力予抑平，幷已與亞細亞，德士古諸公司商妥，決由該公司等無限制出出出售，總之本局抑平物價具有絕大決心，且復其有絕對把握，故深盼市民切勿爲讀言所惑，免爲奸商所乘云。又奸商操縱物價，囤積物資等情形，市民可逕向該局經濟行政處物價管理課檢議，油·米·棉布·絨綫·煤球等諸用品，如有超過該局限價者，亦可撿舉，一經發現，決予嚴懲云。</p>
<h3>造紙工廠前途危殆　國營十五紙廠僅六家開工　民營廿三紙廠規模均狹小</h3>

<h3>當局今日派員　巡視南北米市</h3>
<p>日來食米價格又告暴漲，升斗小民莫不惴惴，感受威脅，吳市長對於食米價格之穩定，素極重視，際此急景凋年，不容食米有暴漲現象，故會表示各檔米價必需依照審議值格，且滬市存底充沛，同時各地來源暢旺，食米絕無一問題，實無漲價理由，業己令社會局嚴密監視米塲交易，擬悉有關當局己決定於今日派員前往南北兩市塲巡視，如發現有抬價，囤貨不售，或有類似情事者，決予取締，並加嚴懲云。</p>
<p>又訊，記者昨特往訪本市糧政負責人·承告：食糧漲風，固由於黃美金鈔刺激，大半實由奸商操縱所致，糧食部上海總倉庫昨己派員赴錫，將前購存無錫之白米五萬担提存來滬，必要時仍予以配售。又洋米三萬噸日內即將進口，計有三十七萬担餘，單此一項，足够全市八月所需。若干奸商囤戶，現囤積不售，短期內必遭打擊，蓋高利貸實爲囤積之致命傷，渠對米市前途，絕對樂顧，預料日內即將下跌。</p>

<h3>原料缺乏結匯損失　花邊出口一落千丈　亟盼政府予以相當協助</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕花邊抽綉業本爲我國重要手工業之一，戰前動國沿海各省依此爲生者，不下一千萬人。在出口價值上，且竹超過我國特產絲綢之出口值，而躍佔出口總值巾之筆五位，實爲我國換取鉅額外匯之重要出口物資。奈勝利後亦因受原料人工昂貴，及交通阻阻阻滯等影饗，產量旣少，出口更勘。據業巾人分析原因：（一）主要原料爲蔴布及紗綫兩種。蘇布素來仰給於英國。惟新貨蔴布，英國穤至後年方能恢復供應，且定價已較戰前漲起四倍。滬市存貨，刻亦已八倍於戰前價格。至紗綫價格，如以美金價格計值，亦較戰前漲起十七倍。故無論中外原料，價均昂貴。（二）工銀方面，以地區而稍有不同。花邊抽誘業，本以汕頭烟台等地爲主。茲烟台方面，以時局不靖，生產困難，惟油頭工銀，較滬市約廉一倍。故目前汕頭方面，尚維持小額之生產量。據佔計每月產量價值，的在法幣三億元左右。該地工銀，如以美金計值，亦較戰前漲起一倍。然汕地原料奇缺，正常生產，尚不可能。至本市方面，工銀太貴，原料又昂，故生產全部陷於停頓。（三）交通阻滯。單以主要產地汕頭與滬市交通而言，每月往來船隻極少，影響產品運銷殊大。（四）匯兌之耗損。以內匯，上海匯出百元，至汕地僅收九十二元。以外匯言，目前官價美匯，與美鈔黑市，相差已超過一倍。花邊抽誘業支付膨賬己超過萬倍之原料工銀等，所生產成品，外銷所得之外匯，仍須以膨脹僅及千倍之官價美匯，結售予政府。此中損失，不言可喻。職是之故，該業目前產品品品品外銷，殆已陷於全盤停頓狀態中。戰前該業公會，共有會員一百五十餘家，現已减少爲一百十三家。故亟盼政府及關係當局，能子協助。該業人民，提出兩點：（一）該業仰給於國外之王要原料如蔴布花錢等，希能豁免其進口稅，以减輕原料之成本。（二）出口所獲外匯依官價結售予政府後，　政府能按黑市差額補貼，俾維該業生產成本。</p>
<h3>商業不景氣　上週倒閉廿家</h3>
<p>以以日用品食品店爲多</p>
<p>上週本市商業情況未見轉佳，倒閉之商店廠家，共計二十家，其原因分爲二類，（一）受市面不景氣影饗，（二）受高利貸壓迫，倒業之商店，計食品類七家，日用品類十家，類別未明者三家，依日期分十六日一家，十七日五家，十八日三家，十九日四家，二十日四家，二十一日一家，二十二日二家云。</p>

<h3>美棉限制進口　紡織業將受影響</h3>
<p>饑棉紡職業某鉅子對記者談稱：我國工業而能於世界佔一席地位者，　惟棉紡職業，此次勝利之後，其接收敵偽產業中，當以紡織事業之成績爲最佳，自民國二十八年抗職軍與，各業工廠多事影響，生產日少，惟人民衣着不可或缺之紡織事業，反一躍而爲首屈一指之優厚工業，所惜者，其營業權尚操諸敵人掌握，現在抗戰勝利，因戰時損失之法大，人民衣着缺乏，亟待補充，故紗布需要，尤惑迫切，戰時因受政府之統制，營業多遭限制，勝利來臨後，政府取消同之，紡織業乃得自由發展，加以美棉低，而製品價漲，造成紡織業之黃金時代，但此種景象，決不能維持渦久，　美棉進口已受限制，將來價格，安能長此低，我國原係以晨立國，今則棉花仰給外人，惟其原因，無非國棉成本較高，且其品質又不若美棉優良，因此　棉者，多改種其他　物，是以棉產即無法增加，惟若美棉棉進口日少，國棉產量無多，則今後國棉之價格，當不待提而自高，紗布成本即重，獲利自少，紗織業之前途固未可常保得此黃金時代云。</p>

<h3>歐美經濟政策　促進生產　爭取外匯</h3>
<p>錢天鶴氏談考察歐美感想</p>
<p>我國物價上漲，生產萎縮，政府對穩定幣值，抑平物便，曾採種種措施，如最近修正進出口方案，設輪入管委會，以增厚外　基金，平抑物價，設生產貸款審核會，促進生產事業，復典經濟，戰後復原國家，非僅我國如此，海外各國莫不皆然茲據會於本年度五月間奉派出國，遍赴歐美各地考察戰後農業生產及復原狀況，方於上週三（十八）返滬之農林部次長錢天鶴氏語稱：戰後復員國家，莫不以加緊生產，鼓勵出口爲前題，美國生產力強大，遭受戰時損失，又較其他國家爲輕，但英國之當前政策，則　然一極度強調增產營銷利益三項，兼籌並顯，其　本修件，爲鼓勵生產，兼及其營銷範　，使出品不致呆滯，且設迭增加利益，而加強生產及營銷興趣，例如農產物定價低廉，在消耗方面，减輕負担，農民於售價外獲有津貼利潤，此種津貼來原，則以日用品中抽稅百分之五或廿，甚至對奢侈品中抽百分之百，以彌補之，如此晨產不致飛漲，使人民生活感受威脅，此爲新興「均當」法之一種，又如省衣節食，剩餘物資　量輸出國外，爭取外匯，現在英國市民衣着，每年由政府發給‘購買券五十至六十張，規定襪一雙，需券一紙，領帶二紙，衣一襲則需券廿六紙，是則終年所得，僅足換衣兩襲，他無論矣，本人留英時，觸目所及，踝　街上之紳士，，常御數年前之服裝，英人重修　。　視之並不寒搶，食的方面，亦受限制，以前鷄蛋，麵粉，豬肉，火腿，均仰給于丹麥，目下英人規定一月食蛋一枚，麵包减少而代以蔬菜，英國爲產魚鳥國，而以魚爲主要希　，摒棄火腿豬肉，甚至不借取諸兔肉，平時艦費五先令，以一湯一菜一點心爲限，值此歲尾年頭，政府當局採辦橋于進口時，則藉無綫電廣播市民，認此爲耶誕節來臨之　音，關於幣制，最近以流行銀質輔幣改爲　質，而以銀質鎔化，償還戰債，諸如此類，不一而足，其日常生活，較之美國，低廉一倍，法國丹麥等，用又較英再低三分之一，法以政治動　關係，復原較緩，建設方面，則有顯著進步，丹麥素爲農業國，戰時受損頗輕，目下農業發展，生產加增，實足驚人，惟以對英輪出較前驗减，引爲憂慮，總之，歐洲各國對生產事業，認爲當前急務，而對外輸出，換取外匯，覓不容緩，即不得已時，而求諸他國原料進口者，亦改　易　，憲舍與己疏者之國家，而取給於親者近者，如英之小麥肉類，蛋類，前由丹麥主要輸入，現則改由加拿大進口矣云</p>

<p>市長致詞</p>
<p>吳市長略稱：今日之一切問題，均須鎮靜以待之，對於小學教師欲　整待遇一項，須靜候中央調整公務員薪給之明令到達後，再作決定。吳市長對於小學教師極表同情，調吾等不幸生而爲　國人，更不幸生而爲中國之小學教師，生活之窘困，自在所難免，然吾等尚須深切了解爲政者之苦　，政府無時無刻不在替人民想辦法。譬如最近舉辦之工業貸款，雖明知此舉可能引起一部分自私言利者投機利用，但爲整個工集界之前途計，仍毅然舉辦，結果促使黃金美鈔之在跳，即爲某種階級操縱之明證。所以小教同仁，務必體諒爲政有之苦心，即使在最艱苦之生活條件下下下，仍望守住崗位，努力本位之工作。</p>
<p>解答問題</p>
<p>吳市長致詞後，當由到會各小學教師提出數項問題，由吳市長各別解答如下：</p>
<p>問：據傳小學教帥之待過，經中央明文規定，不得超過委任級，是否可靠？</p>
<p>答；未詳，若果眞有此法令，而認爲不妥當者，同入儘可以合法手續，向當局提出請求修正。</p>
<p>問：行總之救濟寒衣，小學教師何以未列入救濟之列？</p>
<p>答：因本市多數難民，尚未領到，故小教同仁未能普發。</p>
<p>問：關於尊師金之舉，爲何有部分郊區市校尚無法領到？</p>
<p>答：此羅保　　　　　問題保證於最近期內即可全市領到</p>
<p>問：過去領　手續極爲麻煩，</p>
<p>答：以後當力求簡　。</p>
<p>問：市府各局採用年功制，每年可進一級，而市校教師，則須四年進級，希望力求縮短。</p>
<p>答：可正式備文請求。</p>
<p>討論提案</p>
<p>又關於市小教師所提出之五項請求案，昨日會巾，亦經對諭如下；（一）對於請求提高底薪一項，實時尚無辦法。（二）對於　整特遇問題，則須待中央調整公務員之明令到達後，再作討論。（三）請求　衣　五十萬元一項，尚無先例。（四）請求於每月初發發薪津一項，只要財政局辦事手續上無特殊困難，想必可無問題。（五）明年起酌收教師生活補助費一項，現時亦恐難以辦到，該會或可先向市參議會等社團作呼籲。　另訊：本市市立各校教師，以待遇菲薄，要求市府予以改警，私立中小學聯合會聞訊後，即去函表示員情，願對此緊急呼籲，竭誠協助，冀早日圓滿解決云。</p>

<h3>東北大陸觸角　旅順·大連　接收前夕</h3>
<p>— 十三日瀋陽航訊　本報東北特培元韓清濤</p>
<p>大進是東北大陸的門戶，水陸大碼頭，國際自由港，旅順，是軍事上的咽喉，是要塞，是軍港，是海軍根據地，兩個海　上的要城，伸進了渤海灣，構成了東北大陸的觸角。</p>
<p>根據中蘇友好條約，卅年內，旅順軍港，是由中蘇兩國共同使用，期滿，無償完全歸還我國，大進是國際自由貿易港，近來中央要正式接收大進和旅順的民事行政了，同時國軍也進到了大連市區的邊界綫上，於是旅大成爲舉世注意的焦點。</p>
<p>五十年的壓榨，五十年的變質，旅大雖然和祖國有些隔膜了，但旅大同胞，臨終沒忘掉他們是中國人，因爲生就的中國胚子，過去，始終被日人歧視，鞭策，血，淚，力，汗，造成了旅大的繁榮，枯乾了旅大同胞的血汗，如今已經一兩輩子了！</p>
<p>五十多個年頭血淚歷史的翻身，五十多個年頭　抑的昭雪，在東北光復後，就放在了國人的兩肩，但一年多旅大是什麽局面，旅大的同胞，又看到的是些什麽，國人是耳有所聞了，或者竟是目有所睹了，今天，大家一致的要求，是明朗，正常化，國土，主權，由政府接收，不答許割裂破壞！</p>
<p>國軍在大連邊緣</p>
<p>這一次國軍向大連方面前進，是從復縣—又名瓦房店附近開始的，時間是十一月廿四日的午間，第一個目標是中長路上的復縣城，同時還有金城鐵路綫上的城子喧，以及貔子窩，如此已經把持了旅大的兩條大腿，緩緩向前推進，從復縣到普蘭店是六十里。在十一月底，又把普蘭店接收了，普蘭店到石河是廿五里，那裏是中蘇友好條約上共同使用旅順海軍根據地防禦區域界綫，當時還有蘇軍在駐守，國軍爲了避免誤會，遂在榶房屯一帶停止前進了。</p>
<p>金城路上的國軍，沿着路綫前進，並在中長路和金城路中間地區，作肅清工作，向西南行軍。在十二月五日以前，又到達了旅大兩條腿的跨襠，也就是中長和金城的會和點了，地名呌做廣甯寺，於是又閃　了鐵路綫，在中長鐵路綫以東至於海岸綫上的廣大地區　活動，　　大和尚山做了根據地。</p>
<p>大和尚山，又呌做老虎山，是大連市的界綫。這條綫是從大和尚山經和尚屯，曹家屯一帶，東至海岸綫，以至於海面，全綫是一個大弧綫，由大和尚山西南經南山以及南　　迤西，遙遠的投到了旅順附近的龍王塘，這裏也就是旅大兩市交界點。</p>
<p>大和尚山，是金州東方的一個高山，一部國軍從這裏沿着大連市邊界綫，向西南行進。在金州城南方，也是在金州民政署所在地的金州站南方，橫越鐵路，金州站是金城路的起點，國軍沒進金州城，沒到金州站，經過南山，在山地間運動，並有一小部分到達了南關　車站附近，也許這裏就是鐵路綫右翼的前哨了，同時還有一小部份，在甘井子支綫活動，這也可以說是左　的前哨，如此已進入大連市區邊界了。</p>
<p>這是十二月五日前後的事，據說在這個時候，國軍發現了蘇軍，遂又停止前進了，因爲國軍是特別顧及到了中蘇的友誼，避免發生不必要的誤會，等待外交上的解決，同時又據說這也是給共軍自動退出的機會，免致發生戰爭，再有重大的死傷和破壞，因爲軍事當局，對於接受大連事，避免有所說明，進軍詳情，或與此文有所出入，但記者曾由多方面着手，大致是這樣的，今後只看共軍如何退出大連了，國軍現在已經等候在門前了。</p>
<p>第一軍港</p>
<p>旅順，站在遼東半島最南端的一角，和山東半島的蓬萊，環抱着渤海，成爲渤海的門戶，它面對着浩澣大海，環繞着大大小小的羣山，經過帝俄和日本的經營，建設，成了北洋第一的軍港和海軍根據地。</p>
<p>旅順車的邊界綫，東從龍王塘起，經過旅順路的長　子和龍頭站間，又通過土城子，延伸到了北方海面的大潮口　，旅順的主要市區，在東南角，西南角被　山　據了，好多的村屯，圍繞在山脚下，西北角也是同樣的情景，也可以這樣說，旅順的市區，除了近西邊的一綫平原外，餘者幾乎都是山地了。</p>
<p>新市街在西，舊市街在東，由着一條鐵路綫和半截龍河，遠遠的隔開了，旅順車站在河東岸，同時也是在西港的邊沿上，新舊市街，由着兩個橋樑，聯繫着交通，新市街有兩條河，舊市街有一條河·山水·花　·住宅·海水浴場，樣子是十分整齊美麗的。</p>
<p>旅順的市區計劃，無論新舊市街，差不多都是　　帝俄時代的款式，其後追加擴張一部，總面積已經達到了六百七十九萬坪。據統計：全市有十四萬二千七百人，村落三百二十四個。</p>
<p>旅大間的交通，計有「旅大南道」和「旅大北道」，南道是條新式公路，這條沿着海岸綫長約十一里的大道，是日人費時三年，投資百三十五萬日元所完成的「塔爾瑪可達姆式」近代公路，北道全長約十四里，沿綫多柞樹，也有好多的村屯，從　市街開車沿着鐵道綫，傍過水師營，再經三　堡會，土城子，營城子，　　　山，跨上車長路上的周水子，到了大連，時間也是一小時，在旅大北道上，有一條現在呌做「旅順路」的鐵道綫，也是繞着羣山，和公路時合時　的，溝通着旅大客貨運輸，以及軍事上的使用。</p>
<p>由着一個地形的像尾巴的「老虎尾半島」，構成了一個險要的軍港，西港是寬闊　，東港是一個小型的船塢，關於旅順港口的協定：該地防護由我國委託盟邦蘇聯　理，其經費由蘇聯自行負担，三十年期滿後，該區內一切設備　公產，不論是否　聯所有，都無償歸還中國。所以現在的旅順港口，由蘇軍駐紮並利用其設備，是全無　　的。我國政府將來的接收，主要是旅順的民事刑政，在軍事設備方面，我國政府僅與盟邦蘇聯共同使用。</p>
<p>美的都市</p>
<p>大連是我國的一個美麗的都市，綠油油的大海，繞在了東南北三面，日人培植的櫻花，春天裏開遍了所有的山頭，原野，燦爛奪目，美不勝收！</p>
<p>埠頭區，西崗子，是商業繁　區域，星　浦的花園，海水浴場，風光旖旎，沙河口的工業區，也是很有名的，一個鐵工廠，有十多萬的工人。</p>
<p>大連，是歐亞交通的十字路口，從海上到達了大連，捨舟登陸，往北和西方，十日可達莫斯科，十二日到柏林，水陸南距上海五百四十四海浬，香港一千二百二十五海浬，東距大阪八里六十七浬，此外距營口一百七十七海浬，安東一百五十七海浬。</p>
<p>大連港設備：灣內的水路在潮面約保有十公尺的水深，在碼頭上包括有長約五公里的防波堤，堤裏的水上面積，有九十五萬坪，更有闊約一百公尺的棧橋，突出堤內水上，這樣長大的突出堤，延長六公里，可容五千噸的輪船四十艘停泊港中，二萬噸以下的大船，更可任意停泊。</p>
<p>碼頭內部的面積，約爲七十五萬坪，是以人工填成的，又在四大棧橋上面，各敷有四綫的鐵路，同時可有運載貨物一千噸的火車，往來不絕，沿岸又有兩層或三層混凝土倉庫，旅客棧橋邊岸，設有可容一萬旅客的招待所，內部設備，應有盡有，在此大厦屋頂，有無綫電播音室，指示海上行船。</p>
<p>市中心區，有中央廣場，設置小公園·市政廳·法院·銀行·旅館·商工會·郵政局·領事館·　　圓週上，從這個中央區，有八大馬路，向各方射出，南山脚下的住宅區，全爲西式建築，精巧美麗。</p>
<p>大連市自來水和下水道的設備，是使人注意的一件工程，這個大工程，利用天然的傾斜地形，所有垃圾·積雪·糞便等物，流入入口後，就可一瀉千里，吐入大海，因雨澤少，土地乾燥關係，在市外的王家屯和靠近旅順的龍王塘山間，築有高約二十餘公尺，進深三四公里的大貯水池，以三十公里長的水管，接入市區的給水池中，足供一百五十萬市民使用。</p>
<p>據民國廿九年五月十八日的調查，全市人口約計五十九萬零八百五十七人，內有日人一十七萬五千四百八十三人，全市有「國民學校」和「公學校」兩種，國民學校是教育日人子弟的，初　教育設施，公學校是教育我同胞子弟的，民國三十三年調查：國民學校三十七所，學生二萬四千餘人，公學校計有一百四十三所，學生八萬五千人，中學校官立四所，公立一所，學生五千餘人，高等女學校，官·公·私立共五所，學生六千六百人，高等公學校在旅順和金州各一所，教育雖然可說是相當的發達，但，裏面正含着許多的毒素。</p>
<p>旅大交界</p>
<p>從大連到旅順去，從大連坐汽車出發，首先經過名勝區域「星個浦」，接着是海岸遊園地，黑石　，小平島，老座山　道，再前進，到了旅大兩市交界地點的龍王塘，這裏是一個大水源地，綠蔭遮道，水源清澈，風景清幽，接近旅順了，鑽過白銀山隧道，　望海水浴場，已經到了旅順，從北路乘火車或坐汽車都可以，南北兩條公路，加上火車路綫，來往時間差不多都是一小時。</p>
<p>日人誇耀的說：這裏是一個「東方文化之都」，同時也是一個貿易額佔五大商港中第二位的商港，一切都顯示着新興和活躍的氣息，雖然，他的陰影裏，另有兇殘的魔手，在傷害和壓榨我們的同胞！</p>
<p>關於大連港口的中蘇協定：蘇聯在此自由港上的　利，一是對日作戰時以軍事統制推行於大連，二是平時無債租用碼頭倉庫及一切港口設備的半數，三是蘇方進出口貨物免稅，大連的行政權，完全屬於我國，平時的軍事警備，也完全屬於我國，所以我國政府將來接收大連，要接收大連的全部財產·權利·將其一部轉租給蘇聯。</p>
<p>日人統治旅順大連，五十年來，搜刮東北同胞的血汗，在物資建設方面，是有偉大的成就，血，肉，淚，堆成的樂園，今天，摧毀，破　，已經改換了面目，遭受到了莫大的犧牲，五十年　過　來的旅大，明天又不知是什麽情景！</p>
<p>星期論壇</p>
<h3>論大規模的工業組織</h3>
<p>— 簡貫三</p>
<p>西洋近代工業組織進展的經過，先是小規模的工廠紛紛成立，使家庭工業失去原有的地位；後來大規模的工業風起　湧，小規模的工廠或受技術的淘汰，或爲大企業所兼併，便演成競爭劇烈的局面。這個局面推演所及，所謂「托拉斯」，「卡特爾」，「康采倫」，便　　興起，如大兵團似的互相對峙。</p>
<p>企業的兼併或幾種，大概可以分爲兩類：第一爲組織鬆懈的「利益協定」，如「卡特爾」，「新狄加」是也。凡加入這個協定的，不過是遵照契約上的規定事項共同行動，而原有的獨立性格，並未喪失，好像是這一個國與那一個國，雖在軍事上結成攻守同盟，而在主權上，還各是一個獨立的國家。第二類爲組織嚴密的「企業合併」，如「托拉斯」，「康采倫」是也。凡參加這一類組織者，原有的單位一律解散，另成一幅更大的企業組合，好像是幾個小國合併爲一個大國以後，各自的獨立性便失去了。</p>
<p>無論是「利益協定」，或「企業合併」，凡經營同類的產業，這種爲「橫的結合」，「同類的結合」，否則，便稱爲縱的結合或「異類的結合」。後者比前者更爲深入，更爲利害。日本石濱知行有云，「獨佔體制在一千八百六十年以前，只是初露萌芽，至於大的發展，還是在一千八百九十年代的初期，「卡特爾」已不是少年時代，而是成年時代了。凡原料產業，礦山產業，冶金產業，都漸次趨向「卡特爾」化，走到獨佔的階段。」</p>
<p>這些大的組織，若指摘其弊病的所在，如利慾過強，獨佔太兇，以及操縱市場，把持經濟，莫不是其中最顯著的事實。但它旣是近代社會中最重要的組織，當然也有它的優點：第一，它資本雄厚，能夠使用最近的機器，促進工業的發展。第二，它以最新的技術，從事大量生產，所製造的物品，當然價廉物美。第三，因爲它組織龐大而體系嚴密，政府統制起來，較爲容易。例如統制幾個大汽船公司，或托拉斯，總比統制許多木船方便多了。我國在抗戰時期，管制物價所以困難重重，從　租方面說，因爲農業社會的經濟學位過於分散，新式工商業的結合缺乏體系，自難收指　之效。</p>
<p>德國在工業革命史上，可以說是較爲落後的國家，但是它的工業所以能進展迅速，後來居上，它一經發動工業革命，便注意大規模組織，未嘗不是一個重要原因。</p>
<p>英國在工業上原是較爲穩健的國家，迨至第一次大戰爆發，因受戰火的緊迫，亦不得不致力於「企業集中」把「托拉斯」「卡特爾」的組織，更加擴大起來。到了戰後，爲着挽救經濟上的衰落，仍然致力於這個方向，如蘭開夏紡織業組合　　煤業組合蘭克夏鋼　業組合都是資本雄厚的龐大組合。</p>
<p>英國得天獨厚，環境頗適，在工業組織上尤易於向龐大的方面發展。這個趨向，約分爲兩大階段，即十九世紀爲生產規模的擴大時期，廿世紀爲企業管理的　中時期。這種集中的大組織，如羅馬拂爾的美孚煤油托拉斯，摩爾根的鋼鐵托拉斯，福特的汽車「康采倫」，都是國際上最有聲勢的。</p>
<p>中國現在還趑趄於家庭式的舊工業組織與小規模的新企業組織之間，連西洋十八九世紀的局面還相差甚遠，無怪乎我們的國家，一方面戰時管理頗不容易，他方面平等生產不夠需用。茲專就工廠方面說，不僅數量少，而且規模小。</p>
<p>公司組織爲現代工業中最能向大的方面發展的組織；但是爲什麽易於向大的方面發展，成爲現代工業較新的結合？第一，它是一個法人，有其獨立的穩久的性格。第二，它能把許多零碎的資本，　集一起，發生大的效用。第三，多半爲有限公司，負有限的責任，不因公司倒閉，而影響各股東股本以外的資產。第四，它有股東會，董事會，　察會，與近代民主政治的作風有點相似。</p>
<p>至於合夥與獨資的組織，却缺少了公司的優點，似乎仍然帶着家庭工業時代的氣息；不僅硬性太重，而且範圍狹小，很難適應這個大工業時代的需要。近代西洋工業所以能夠迅速的發達，由合夥獨資進展爲公司組織，確有很大的幫助。國人在農業社會過慣了家族生活，其經濟的關係，往往只限於家族　　　鄉黨，對於這種以廣大經濟關係爲紐帶的公司紕　，當然不很信任，漠然視之。中國公司之不易成立，這種心理上的因果，不無相當影響。</p>
<p>即使勉強成立，因爲在農業社會　沈很久的人，缺乏了組織觀　，有謂意氣的，有不聞不問的，也很難順利進行，維持長久的時間。中國許多工業組織，其來也難，其去也速；從心理上　，這是農業社會所遺留下來的封建意識在那邊作祟。以後工業發達起來，這些意識，將要逐漸消除的。</p>
<p>說到這裏，或許有人以爲「大規模的工業組織，一旦發達起來，恐推演所及，違反了節制資本的原意。」我以爲全國的金融與交通，旣均在中央權力之內，凡有獨佔性的工業，旣定爲國營的範圍，那末，無論那一個大規模的民營工業，即不必顧慮其雄據的一方，形成「經濟上的藩鎮。」這種「藩鎮」只有在私人壓倒國家資本的歐美，容或易於成長，而在三民主義的新中國，實難有其存在的餘地。况且節制資本的手段，有初期，中期，後期的輕重緩急之別，何必在幼　的初期，就給以嚴厲的限制，使工業連帶的不能發展呢。工業發展到了中期，似乎具備相當規模，國家爲着財政上的或國防上的理由，當然要用累進方法徵收它的臨時資本稅，遺產稅，過分利得稅；並且制定災害賠償法，勞工保險法，勞資爭議處理法，勞工福利金籌撥法；直接的爲勞工謀利益，間接的减少工業家利用資本與組織的威風。到了工業最發達的時期，大的企業　有壟斷的事實，　及大衆的福利，國家再拿出強制手段，收歸國有，以實現民享的目的，亦爲未晚。英國的工黨領袖說過：「工廠兼併成爲龐大的組織，實在並無妨碍。因爲大的組織，到了相當時期，容易收歸國有。」再依據國父在實業計劃中的見解，尤足以證明大規模的工業組織，是經濟進化的結果，最後可用國有的方法調治其本身的弊害。他說：「大公司能節省浪費，能產出廉價物品，非私人所能及。不論何時何地，當有大公司成立，即將其他小製造業掃除淨盡，而以廉價物品供給社會，此固爲社會之便利。但所不幸者，大公司多屬私有，其目的在多獲利益，待至一切小製造業皆爲其壓倒之後，因爲競爭，而將各物之價值增高，社會上實受無形之壓迫也。大公司之出現，係經濟進化之結果，非人力所能屈服，如欲救其　，只有將一切大公司組織，歸諸通國人民國有之一方。」</p>
<p>所謂「大規模的工業組織」（大公司僅是其中之一）旣爲經濟進化的結果，而其弊害又可以主義或計劃經濟的力量調整醫治，我們這個工業幼　的國家，何必因　廢食，存着畏懼的心理呢。我們不養成資本主義制度，乃是顧慮它壟斷的弊害，並非連它的「大規模組織」一筆抹殺。所謂民生主義或社會主義的社會，是將大規模的組織發揚光大，以適應「社會化」的　　，也並非取消它，分散它，回復到狹小的經濟體制。所以資本主義社會的大規模組織，實在是建立民生主義的根基，若沒有這個根基，只想在小農或手工業的廢　之上實現民生主義，不過是黃金色的幻夢而已。</p>
<p>再由我國公營企業增加的情况看起來，私人的工業組織，雖讓它向大的方面發展，也不至於尾大不掉，造成「經濟上的藩鎮。」總之，今後中國工業上的經營，旣然以計劃經濟爲重心，握着了中心關　，那末對於民營工業儘可讓它發展，使公私兩方共同致力於工業建設。</p>
<p>所以國營工業固然要向大規模的方面，積極進行，而民營工業，也應獎勵它們同樣向大的方面努力邁進。否則，畏首畏尾，進退兩難，恐永遠停滯在半途之中而無迅速成功的希望。</p>

<p>日本紡織工業之發達，在戰前已與英國競爭於世思國際市塲，而其戰前的十五年中改進之速度，努力之成效，允非世界各國所能及。其領導世界紡織工業之野心，也漸由理想而成事實。然好景不常，此次以一念之差，而遭軍閥造成侵華戰爭之發生，以致各種工業乃均呈停頓狀態，而尤以紡織工廠之犧牲最巨，戰時遭受美空軍轟炸之損失允大。惟自去年失敗無條件投降後，乃得美國的全力支撑，與其優秀之民族性，現已絡續恢復運轉。據最近調查所得，最近日本紡織工廠設備之完全，生產之迅速精密，令人驚懼。我國勝利後，我行我素，自私自利，不求改進，前途實堪憂慮。茲將日本紡織工廠之現狀及其優點，述之於後，以供我紡織界之研究，與政府當局之警惕。</p>
<p>日本之紡織工廠經此次大戰後，機器損毀固多，經濟實力固小，但其具同心協力之精神，加速整理之教力，大部情形已漸轉良好。在各種工業中，紡織仍占較優之地位，其設備之改革，工作之進步，實有出人意料之外。</p>
<p>絲逐漸在復原之日本紡織工業，已在擬大規模復活其一度聞名於世之絲織業。其目的有二：一以供出口以易取糧食，一則以補充國內紡織品之短少。日本絲織業之五年計劃，擬在各產絲區巾心設委員會，在次要之地設小組委員會，以監督絲之生產，管制桑樹之分配，肥料之配給。現全國新植桑樹逾五千萬棵。日本人造絲之生產，亦有三年計劃之擬具。月前日本人造絲產量，雖僅及戰前百分之二十，此係因日本全國之人造絲工廠，至今因煤斤或機械之缺乏而開工僅百分之十三。但些一種問題，如短時期內即可解決，則日本人造絲三年計劃之目標，擬在一九四七年內產人造絲六〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇磅，至一九四八年更擬增至一〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇磅。至日本蠶絲鐵維，以戰爭期間，各種原料欠缺，所護擴展至大·目前關工數，亦僅爲其全國生產總數之百分一五。但若計劃切實實施，則一九四七及一九四入年，　絲議維之生產量，當各爲六〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇及一〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇磅。而日本本國至多消納一萬一千八百磅，則其餘的勢將轍出，供美國，中國，墨西哥等戰前市塲消納。</p>
<p>棉再按一九四六年八月美國國務院與陸軍部所聯合發表的赴日國際紡識者察團的調查，日本的棉紡織工業已裝置的新錘爲二，一五〇，〇〇〇個，其中可用的爲一，一一五，〇〇〇個。據估計如能啟用存放機件，並修理已損懷的機件，到一九四七年一月則可裝好紡錘達三，二二八五，〇〇〇個。如能繼續修理，一九四七年一月以後紡錘的數量還會有所增加。日本於一九四六年原來預計須進二二五，〇〇〇噸棉花，以補國產之不足，但最近則日本已能自給自足。且一九四七年如棉花接濟不輟，其存貨則至少足供二個月的消耗，那末到明年十一月底，常有一萬四千四百萬磅的棉紗，可供輸出。而在本年內日本的棉紡織工業除一一一千萬磅棉紗與九十萬磅棉織物以外，可望有三萬五千方碼的棉布進備出口。同時美國政府機關物品信甩貸款公司本年度將供給日本棉花八十九萬包，其中一八五，三八四包又運到，而此種棉花均將織成棉布，以供出口。</p>
<p>毛至於日本的毛絨紡織工業的恢復，亦甚穩定。據該業製造商估計，如原料取給無困難，他們今後於十二月內能生產二千五百萬磅的毛絨綫，三千五百萬磅的毛絲合紡絨。然最近毛絨原料尚無進口，而所存者亦不足敷全國該業一月之用，故目前毛絨的貨品暫無法供給輸出。</p>
<p>日本的四大紡織工業，（包括棉紡織，人造絲，生絲，毛絨，）的合全國所有新機器工業的百分之七十五至八十五。它們的能力足以在一九四六年分別增加織機一一，三〇〇架與紡錘二九〇，〇〇〇個，到一九四七年生產紡錘可達七八五，〇〇〇個，織機達一六，八〇〇架。他們即可全部恢復戰前情狀！</p>
<p>從這一連串的消息報告調查中，我們可以知道戰後日本的紡織工業的復興，如何積極。回頭我們的紡織工業，雖政府這次也接收了許多的資產但不善爲利用。又懷着要求日本的紡織工業賠償我國損失戰款的希冀，可是事實是並不如我們這樣理想中那樣便利。中國的紡織工業人仕們，你們也可以醒醒了，（本文參者資料：美國務院公報，美紡織工業會周報第四卷六期及Texiteworld八月號）</p>
<h3>標準化之實施</h3>
<p>— 雪芃</p>
<p>標準的工具</p>
<p>美國底一般工廠雖然是標準化出品最有力的提倡者，但對於他們廠中所用工具的標準化工作却非常退化。這種情形尤以一般的鐵廠更爲顯明。例如我們常常看見一組旋盤大小機能量一樣，而製造的廠家卻不止，處構造底方法也大不相同，有的有一個每英寸上綫的導螺旋，有的每英寸四綫，有的每英寸五綫。有的齒輸底齒數是以十爲倍教，有的是以十二爲倍數。這些參差不齊的變動當然是由於競爭及藝術發展底影響。這種大小相同的機械，而有構造不同的特性，對於從事普通及修理工作的工廠並沒有什麼要緊祖當工作須預先設計的時候，這種情形就大大不利了。例如假使所有機械大小相同的，構造底內容也是相同，則編製指導卡片，必定要覺得簡單許多。這種標準化底需要，假使引起一般廠家將相同的出品也採用一二準標準的特性那是無足驚奇的。　維持標準的環境，也是待到標準工作的一個實要的條件。我們上面所說，紡織工廠必須維持着標準的氣候和濕度而後綠可以得到到到最佳的工作就是說明這個原則則則的一個特例。這個原則無論什麼工業都可以適用得着。例如自動的機械是無人格的，常工作的時候，非有設立標準時間相同的環境，就不能得到標準的動作。現在假使調帶寬了，或工具鈍了，我們當然不能希望他有很好的結果，和這此原素合於標準的環境時一樣。其决假使人的原素也須包進，那麼這種關係底影響也要越發利害，因爲人類對於環境所受的惑覺，是比機械還要利害的。例如一個工人不能以受凍的手指，從事精確的量算。大多數的工人都怕在生疎的環境裏做慣做的工作。現在假使以大小及形式相同的機械及技巧相同的工人，繼續製造某種相同的出品，那麼做出來以後，各件成品底成本，如仔細地比較一下，我們必然可以看得出有顯着不同的地方，雖然其不同底原因是很難確說的。這種事實就可以說明環境對於工作的影響。所以即使我們承認在普通情形之下，工人底努力有差異底地方，但如我們仔細研究工作底環境，工具底性質外其他相同的要素，成本底差異是可以大大減少的。</p>
<p>標準的持久性</p>
<p>這一點似乎是很重要的，我們在上面已經說過標準化作用，有使製造方法及程序結晶底趨勢，因而阻礙工業底進步，所以標準底選擇，應十分審慎纔是。就是上節所述工具底標準化，也許會阻礙該項工業底進步雖然同時有相當的利益。可是我們應分別那些有普遍功用的標準如權度之類，及特別通用於某種工業的標準。我們這裏所說的標準的設計，標準的方法，標準的工具，及標準的環境，不過是某個時間從事某種工作的一種最適宜的方法，假使以後有更好的方法，這種襟準還是可以變更的。</p>
<p>標準化及個性</p>
<p>標準化作用對於有嚴格動用的出品的價值及需要差不多人人一致承認。例如標準化的鋤犁電話收話器，鐵路臥車汽車及舖地花磚等，大概是沒有人反對的。但有人却是對於標準化作用，始終懷疑，恐怕這個制度行得太遠甚至會影響及人們底藝術生活。例如有思想的人，總是不願意看見標準化的房屋，就是在工廠市鎮之中，也是一樣，依據同樣的理由，大概也沒有人贊成那些東西如窗，門，造屋磚家具等等底極端標準化或簡單化·又建築家雖然不反對藏納電綫地道，電球座及電燈泡，等等標準化，但他總希望牆上實出的電燈架，要出自他底藝術上的設計。此外類似的證例，還可以舉出許多呢？　我國在抗戰勝利利利之今日，工業建設允屬重要，對於標準化一點，似乎更宜加以研究，平日實施。</p>
<h3>工商管理概論</h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>（四）失業的問題</p>
<p>在失業的人之間，可以分爲兩種，一種是不願意去做工作的人，另一種是因爲沒有工作做而失業的。</p>
<p>有許多貨品，因爲有時令的關係，所以不能常年雇用工人，諸如專門製造聖誕節用的東西，就不能常年雇工人。如果有這種情形，那末可以從工人方面，和企業組織方面兩方面着想，在工人方面，爲了適應環境，可以尋兩個職業，在某一時期做什麼工作，在另一時期做另外一種工作，使用這方法是很不容易得到理想的效果的，因爲兩方面的時期未必能够凑巧，在企業組織方面，如果本來祗做冬令出品，那末不妨再做一種夏令出品，這一種方法就可以產生下列的利益</p>
<p>甲，經常開支，可以每月平均負祖。</p>
<p>乙，可以使孰練的工人全年安心工作。</p>
<p>丙，其他各部份職員也可以經常有事可做。</p>
<p>這是一個企業的經營問題，凡是一個質能爲企業前途着想的主管當局，一定能够想到這種方法的。</p>
<p>但是有時候，市可要遇着不景氣的現象，道不景氣的造成是有下列三個步驟的：</p>
<p>甲，當時的工商業非常發達，每一個人都具有樂觀的態度，生產量大增，銀行也願意放款，不論在製造中或已經製成的貨品，都可以抵押。</p>
<p>乙，但商人們發覺他們所進的貨品太多了，（因爲超過限量，大量進貨以後。當然，不能如期銷完）於是停止進賣，製造工廠因此紙能减少生產，工人們的工資即使不减少，也不能增加，購買力逐漸薄　，因爲購買力薄弱，商人　的貨品出路，更爲遲緩，於量再度减少進貨，襲造廠也就因此生產更少。</p>
<p>丙，但工人們的儲蓄完全用完了，不得不接收較低的工資，（比沒有工做終勝一點）逐　地他們開始購買貨品，商人們看見貨品的銷路有起色，就向製造廠定貨，製造廠的生產量逐漸增多，工人的工資也增加起來，重復到達一個蓬勃的時期。</p>
<p>這可以說明不景氣的由來和由不量氣而景氣的步驟，要免除不景氣的發生，應該從兩方面進行。</p>
<p>一，製造廠商不要生產過量的貨品。</p>
<p>二，工人們不要要求過高的工資。　三因爲製造廠突然增多了生產，就要使生產過剩，銷行呆滯，工人們如果增加工資，那末貨品成本不得不增加，影饗貨品的銷路，也足以使貨品銷行呆滯的，貨品銷行呆滯之後，市面不能流暢，就會逐漸走上不景氣的路。</p>

<h3>記李青崖</h3>
<p>— 復君</p>
<p>在民國十六七年前後，記得正是在中學時代，巳經爲李靑崖先生的「莫泊桑短篇小說集」所着魔了。他那樣的流利的文筆，在那時一些佶屈　牙的譯作之中，眞可說是獨樹一機的。我們那時當然最崇拜魯迅先生了，可是讀他的「苦悶的象徵」，「工人綏惠略夫」諸作，實在有點吃力，竟至爲之　　浩　。當然個人的文學的欣賞能力也許還不幾格，貿然的就對這位文壞先進加以評價，未免過於幼稚；可是那時對於西洋文學作品無論創作和理論，我們這一股　往的熟忱，是誰都不會予以苛資的吧。看到了靑崖先生的那稱流科而又爽快的譯筆，眞是有如長途旅行後突然發現了己抵達目的地那樣的愉快的心情！</p>
<p>成年以後，想不到有一個機緣，我竟做了靑崖先生的旁聽生。這時候，我正式認識了他，我倒有點失望的心緒了。因爲當我們在先續他的文章的時候，以他的那一派流利的文筆，加上莫泊桑的美麗而又現實的內容，理想中總以爲靑崖先生是一個長髮，大領帶，風度翩翩的瀟灑人物，又是第一次一見面，就把這個保留了將十年的可愛的影子如泡沬一樣的頃刻的消滅了。原來他有的是臃腫的中等身材，剃一個平平常常的平頂，披一件灰布大衫，足登布鞋，還戴上一副老花眼鏡……講書時，兩眼朝天，全不注意學生的動態。而語辭緩慢，書法整齋，是他的特點。不過，他批評文壇上當時的許多作家頗爲劇烈，有時雖不免稍嫌過火，但是大體上也多恰到到到好處的。</p>
<p>莫泊桑小說的有系統的介紹，當以靑崖先生爲第一人！但願靑崖先生由莫泊桑創作的介紹，進而對法國的文學作更積極的推　，庶幾可使國人對於法國文學有一個更清晰的面容。</p>
<h3>窗前散章</h3>
<p>— 胡牧</p>
<p>（一）窗</p>
<p>嚴閉着紙窗我不願聽城市的車馬聲……人聲…泥濘的聲音。</p>
<p>我要靜靜的思想，他們爲什麽這樣忙碌；窗，我生活的裝飾呵！</p>
<p>我假想沒有窗子的地方多好多好。</p>
<p>使我的眼睛，可以望見他的眼睛，使我的心靈，可以接近的心　。</p>
<p>於是，我們都　起手來，唱着歌，唱着生活的歌呵！</p>
<p>談談古在今來，於是，生活裏再沒有如此寥寂，乏味。</p>
<p>（二）晨</p>
<p>早晨，我起身最早。</p>
<p>我喜歡在明靜的早晨，認望黎明的燦爛的雲彩，聽聽愉快的奔放的江流聲，小鳥也在此時開盛大的音樂會。</p>
<p>我起身最早，不愛煤煙，我不愛城市中烏濁的空氣。</p>
<p>我更不愛酣夢。</p>
<p>起身早。因爲，我愛黎明我愛陽光。</p>
<p>（三）門</p>
<p>開開門，門外泛濫着人聲，陽光……</p>
<p>門外，花放出鮮艷的花朶，綠野正做完夜之夢。</p>
<p>工作者都從牛肋巴的窗口，還剩下了一綫微弱的豆油燈光，他們起床了，於是，板車夫，挑夫，洗衣婦，人力車夫…都在黎明的路上走着。</p>
<p>我也梳洗了飄亂的髪絲，打着解紅的領帶，挾着書版出門。</p>
<p>去畫一畫沉睡過後的原野，蘇醒的而貌。</p>
<p>（三）陽光</p>
<p>有陽光的天氣。</p>
<p>每個人的險上，塗上了靑春的笑影，每一個人的心裏充滿了感恩的愛。</p>
<p>有陽光的天氣·原野上一片綠油油的野色，綜黃色的茅屋，屋項上正飄起一縷縷的靑炊，小河在激激的流，鳥雀的聲音呌得更美。</p>
<p>我呼吸着陽光的香味。於是，我打開積雪的門窗，拍着手，跳一跳，歡迎陽光，歡迎生命的陽光，進來呵！</p>
<p>於是，我重新整理自己的箱　，整理着自己的靑春呀。……</p>
<p>陽光乾燥的氣息，使我生滿了綠笞的心靈裏，重新復活了。</p>
<p>（四）土地</p>
<p>土地是哺育人類的。我是鄉野的孩子，我更應該向城市人驕傲，我也應該向母親的土地謝恩，我問一問城市　的孩子，「米：是從那兒來的」？</p>
<p>土地是爲我們耕作而鋪設的。</p>
<p>爲了生活，我們應該向土地，向我們生命的泥壤，流一汗液。但，有時積歸一層一層壓着土地的時候。</p>
<p>我，心靈中則充滿了寒傖的自白，與憂　地哼着冬天的歌。</p>
<p>（五）牧人</p>
<p>每天，我推開窗，我就望呵。</p>
<p>春天，夏天，秋…他都在牛背上，用一條小小的細嫩的柳梢，輕輕的趕着牛走呵：從他歡笑的險，我看出了他依然包滿了雙眼的晶瑩的淚水。</p>
<p>生活，磨折他有一條伸不起的背影呀！</p>
<p>牧人騎着牛，從青青的林野中走過，我只聽見那剩餘的一聲聲悲音的牧笛呵！</p>

<p>德國人，常住維也納，與海頓，莫扎特同稱爲「維也納三傑」。西洋器樂的進步，抵貝多芬階段，以達登峯造極之境。貝多芬一生充滿了戀愛的悲喜劇，至其第九交響曲寫作時，兩耳已聾，後爲病魔所擾，煩惱頻生，貝氏於萬種悲憤中譜寫此曲，遂成千古絕唱。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　130</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>這兩類的活動，不問是擁護近衛，或是反對他的，對於鶴見的工作，都是一種障碍。從道種種看來，鶴見想要把那「七封秘　」的秘密，弄到手裏來，勢非首先打破這七層圍子不可。而且爲了種種顧忌，還不能堂而皇之，大張旗鼓的鬥爭，只能暗地設計進行哩。</p>
<p>鶴見的汽車，開足速度，奔馳了五六小時，已經到達東京的市郊，進了安坂養鷄塲。這義鷄塲的主人，從前到外洋留學過多年，信仰自由主義，極端非戰，在鶴見集團裏，他是「〇七號」。在社會上，除了義鷄，還掛着默醫的牌十，不過從不執行業務。現在已有五十多歲，所以也輸不到徵役。他這養鷄塲，雖說佔地五十餘畝，一畝地面，却攤派不到四隻鷄；因他祗重研究血統，鷄種，和養鷄的學理，而不在乎牟利。</p>
<p>這安奴鷄塲，每個月必有巡警光臨兩次。名義上是要保護這鷄塲，免得市外　小，到這裏來掏摸油水，損壞他的事業，實際上却因政治當局說他是「自由主義」·思想不穩定，政府「黑籍」上有他的記錄，恐他活動，所以常來警示他一下。照理，一兩個月來一次警示，本也夠了，却爲什麼來得這樣盤勤？這就要怪這位鷄塲主人，過分好客；每次巡警來了，總要安排些上好酒食，犒勞他一頓。巡警因爲這是公事，僅僅油油隻嘴，總算取不傷廉，於是心安理得。起先是每兩個月來一次，每决也祇是單人匹馬。過了些時，看見主人供奉得二分豐富，於是呼朋引類，都到這裏來吃大戶。又覺兩月一次，時間太長，望得頸疲口　，於是改作一月一次，漸漸巧立名義，又改作一月二次。每次至少四人。</p>
<p>安坂方面，却也樂得：拼了幾塊錢小事，按時打發一頓酒食之後，却也回的有些好處。第一，四近的鄉下人，看了巡象同他來往，認爲他面子大，對他十分恭敬。二，自從有了巡警足跡之後，真的宵小匿跡，不敢事顧。三，那最齊重的一點，他的晴中活動，不惟不怕露跡，反而得了保護；因爲俗話說，「得人的手軟，吃人的口軟，」巡警們吃了他的，每次總給他一個「安分守己，專心學理」的報告。</p>
<p>自從安坂參加了鶴見的工作之後，他這鷄塲，就成了駐京「〇」字頭的大本營。他們雖然從不舉行大會，但小組討論，總是有的，這裏是個天然的小組會議塲所；僅僅祇要避免巡警來打野食的這半個日子，就可十分安全；況且，這半個日子，安坂還可任意操縱，只要打一個電話，說這天酒食不曾準備，改訂一個日期，那比辟瘟散還要靈驗百分，帝般五瘟使者，絕</p>
<p>明的方面，僅以近衛身份而說，他這別府四周，必有秘密警察，日夜巡邏，此外，黑能會，天潢社，自然要經常派人防衛，保護近衛的安全。最厲害的，還要數到德國的第五縱隊，他們對於近衛個人的安全，當然萬分重視，因爲秘密同盟關係，保護近衛，等於保護希魔。至於這般傢伙，厲害到了什麼程度，祇要看到前一天晚上對付鶴見的手段，就可曉得。</p>
<p>除了上面所說，明的兩重，暗的三重，一共五重防綫之外，還有幾重無從預測的阻礙。這些阻礙雖說原因複雜，大概可以歸納成爲兩類：一類是新興團體，希冀攀能附鳳，因此派了秘密份子來，在區內活動，想找些零星消息，作爲親附的因由。另外一類，是反對近衛個人，或反對近衛一派政策的秘密機構，他們當然也有人襲入這個蔡衛區來，探聽近衛的舉動，作爲反對或打擊他的對策　據。</p>

<h3>當兵</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>徵兵工作，業已開始，第一步是調查適齡壯丁，據上海師管區司令稱，所謂適齡壯丁，依兵役法，係自廿一歲起，至廿五歲止，倘使人數不足，則依序遞補。</p>
<p>我們一向有「好人不當兵」的流行語，老實說，就是這句話把我們這個國家害了好幾百年，抗戰八年來，也喫了這句話的大虧，我們已在逐漸矯正這一錯誤的觀念了。現在抗戰業已勝利，一切都以建國爲前提，而徵兵也是一種平時的徵召訓練，當不致令若干人鰓鰓過慮罷！</p>
<p>世界上任何國家的人民都報過兵役，好人都當兵，祗有壞人才逃避兵役，而這等人也往往被社會所不齒。</p>
<p>倘使提出一個反問：你們好人爲什麽不去當兵呢？因爲你們好人不當兵，才更加重這一不良的現象呀！那麼逃避兵役的人們豈不赧顏無地？</p>
<p>最近我看了一張影片：「約克軍曹」（上海譯作「神鎗手」）。以前我讀過一本小說：「高於一切」。我相信凡是看過這張影片這本小說的人，沒有不受感動的。因爲美國人，英國人，他們都可以驕傲，每個人都對他們的國家盡了神靈的義務。</p>
<p>我們愛我們的國家，就不應該無恥地逃避。假使人人都服從兵役法的徵召，踴躍入伍，請設想一下，它的直接與間接的影響，對於這個社會將發生怎樣的功效呀！</p>
<p>種種趣聞</p>
<h3>民主皇宮　前任白宮管家的報告</h3>
<p>— 夢蝶節譯自十二月份Woman's　Home　Companion</p>
<p>後面的幾個關於白宮生活的問題，是白宮前任管家，韓麗泰·納絲畢特（Hen　rietta　Nesbitt）應美國人民之疑問，在「家庭伴侶」雜誌（Woman's　Home　Companlon）上答覆的。納絲畢特在白宮服務十三載，近已去職。</p>
<p>一，白宮裏的日常生活是否很拘謹，受約束的？</p>
<p>答：生活當然比普通人家要受拘束。譬如，那些客人來和杜魯門打撲克，或者來和杜夫人談天，或來約瑪格萊（總統的女兒）都須停在白宮大門外，給保護總統的Secret　Seryice檢查。然後他們再走到門前走廊裏，由一個威嚴的招待者，領他們上樓去。但是在官員招待室的上面一層樓，就是總統家庭住處，則和普通的美國人家一樣—並不拘謹。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫　最難服侍</p>
<p>二，誰是白宮中最難服侍的賓客？</p>
<p>答：是蘇外長莫洛托夫，因爲我們須極小心地保護他。譬如，他在他的房間裏時，所有的僕人須離開那一層樓，等到他下樓後，僕人才准上去做工。莫洛托夫的確使我們的工作更困難。在一九四二年的時候，這種小心我以爲是多餘的。因爲在戰時有聯邦偵察局的保衛，即使一隻老鼠也不能跑進白宮去威嚇他的。</p>
<p>三，白宮的每一個客人都生活得很舒適嗎？</p>
<p>答：是的。客人住的房間很寬大，很舒服。每間都有無綫電及最新的雜誌。客人的早餐是在牀上吃的；他們可以在白宮的草地上打網球，池裏游泳。他們並不要遵守嚴格的規矩或儀式，所以很有自由去做他們歡喜的事。對於賓客們最感榮幸的，就是他們能到白宮去拜訪。誰不喜歡去睡在林肯的牀上，將來去告訴自己的家人或親戚呢？</p>
<p>四，白宮的賓客是否獲取紀念品？</p>
<p>白宮賓客　順手牽羊</p>
<p>答：是的。在我的十三年任中，簡直不能估計共不見了多少匙。還有許多麻的手巾在盥洗室中不見了，使我祗好重新購置起來。當我貼了禁止的字樣後，於是那一部份的東西才不再被帶去作紀念品了。但是有一天，當白宮公開給大衆參觀時，我們發現在東室（East　Room）中，衆人已把我們最好的紅緞窗帷的花邊剪去了。</p>
<p>五，白宮的牀是否舒服？</p>
<p>答：當我第一次去睡時，我覺得它們很舒服，但是羅斯福的孩子們已經睡過很多年了，他們說牀並不好，彈簧已壞而枕頭墊子很硬。經過我把墊褥重新弄軟後，不論羅斯福·杜魯門的家人，或者民主黨及共和黨員，各國的官員都沒有說牀不舒服。</p>
<p>六，羅斯福的孫子，霍浦金（Hopkins）的女兒狄安及荷蘭·挪威避難來的王子·公主的生活如何？</p>
<p>答：他們很少有相同年紀的孩子和他們玩耍，並且一直給保姆·官員看管着，所以生活很缺乏興趣。</p>
<p>祗有在一九四三年的棕樹主日（Palm　Sunday），是他們最高興的一天，因爲那天華盛頓城下了一次不合時節的大雪。孩子躲過了他們的保姆，到廚房裏拿了兩隻端菜的大鋁盤，在白宮的斜草地上滑雪。</p>
<p>孩子們有時在羅斯福總統的牀上枕頭大戰，羅斯福則觀看着，和他們作評判。羅斯福再沒有比他第四任總統就職的那天更快樂，那一天他的十四個孫兒都來了。</p>
<p>白宮之狗　自得其樂</p>
<p>七，白宮中的狗是否和孩子一樣，到處受管束？</p>
<p>答：不，他們比孩子們要快樂得多。杜魯門家裏不養狗；但羅斯福家中從來不曾沒有一隻狗。美國人民都知道羅斯福的那隻蘇格蘭狗，發拉（Fala）的快樂的生活。白宮中第二條有名的狗就是一隻法國髦毛犬蘇西（Suaie）。它是霍浦金夫人結婚時帶來的。它小巧玲瓏而溫和，但總是在地毯上吃東西。</p>
<p>八，白宮裏的食物是整批買的還是零買的？是用電話　貨還是上市場去買？</p>
<p>答：各種方法都有。我用電話整批地買罐頭的豆類　類及馬鈴薯，但我也到近浮金尼亞及瑪利蘭的農場中去買新鮮的蔬菜。</p>
<p>菜單一紙　內容平平</p>
<p>在戰時白宮中所有的食物都是由Secret　Service的專車運來，先在農業部的食物實驗室中檢騐後才送到白宮的廚房裏去。</p>
<p>九，白宮中日常的菜是否奢侈？</p>
<p>答：菜單如下：</p>
<p>清湯　烤肉拼　香　荀　法國的煎洋山芋　Waldorf薩拉（冷盤）　Bavarian巧克力冰淇淋　咖啡</p>
<p>十，白宮中請客的菜單：</p>
<p>文蛤羹（Clam　Cocktail）　牛首湯</p>
<p>甲魚　玉米麵包</p>
<p>去骨閹雞　果醬　豌豆</p>
<p>牛油甜菜　甜洋山芋</p>
<p>乾酪水芹冷盤　白糕</p>
<p>杏仁冰淇淋　咖啡</p>
<h3>白宮內的一景</h3>

<p>這是電話中的問答：</p>
<p>「趙家南先生來麼？」</p>
<p>「還沒有。」</p>
<p>「就來麼？」</p>
<p>「說不定。」</p>
<p>「那末，在他來後，請他打個電話給我」</p>
<p>「這恐怕辦不到。」</p>
<p>「你究是那個？」</p>
<p>「萬國殯儀館！」</p>
<h3>官價市價　皆大歡喜</h3>
<p>— 石</p>
<p>黃金步步高升，物價也隨之跟進，年關在即，正是「幾人歡喜幾人愁」！</p>
<p>黃金有「官價」「市價」之別，官價者「配售之價」，市價者黑市之價也。要取締「黑市」，以救民生？所以從前的一個時期，把「官價配售」。現在呢，「官價」也像兔兒的賽跑，跟在「黑市」的屁後，「突飛猛進」了！</p>
<p>所以，今日的黃金，真是「官價市價」，「皆大歡喜」！佛曰：「善哉善哉」！</p>
<h3>記者出身的部長俞鴻鈞</h3>
<p>— 因果</p>
<p>俞鴻鈞在政治　子　的歷史並不長，但發展的比任何人都快，由上海市政府秘書長發端，而代理市長，而財政部次長，以至今日的財政部部長。</p>
<p>他是廣東人，畢業於聖約翰大學，所以英語講得很流利。在他未踏上政治舞台以前，任上海英文大美晚報的記者，就性格和才能講，他符合了一切記者應有的條件，他活潑，機　，善於交際和活動，尤其善於言語上的應付，給他更大的幫助。假使他是繼續走他的記者生活路綫的話，他可以成一個名記者，在中國新聞事業上，佔一地位，但他終於走上了政治的道路。</p>
<p>「八一三」戰事爆發，上海市市長吳鐵城謂任廣東省主席，代理市長便由當時任秘書長俞鴻鈞擔任，國軍西撤時，俞氏去香港，由於幫助當時「中央信託公司」香港代表孔令侃業務上的缺點，爲當時任「財長」的孔祥熙的器重，而任次長，而孔氏退出政治舞台後，這「財長」便由俞氏擔任以至今日。</p>
<p>他脾氣很豪爽，絕沒有所謂「官架子」，正因爲他是記者出身，他對於新聞記者的態度是使人滿意的，有問必答，如果他有時間的話，他往往會和記者們在辦公室裏暢談，談得痛快的時候，他會絕不顧忌的把他的脚和腿，高高的　到寫字檯上，身子仰靠在轉椅上，幾乎快要倒下來的樣子，於是，記者也可以坐到他的寫字檯上，和他繼續談話。</p>
<p>「八一三」滬戰階段，俞氏代理市長，招待記者時，有一記者問他作業我軍所發大砲，砲彈命中何處？俞氏笑答曰：「我沒有與砲彈一齊打出去。」從這一句「妙答」里，可以略知俞氏之善於應付新聞記者了。</p>

<h3>The National Assembly Presidium's 24th Meeting Discusses Procedures for Implementing the Constitution, Presidential Election within Three Months After Promulgation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] The 24th meeting of the National Assembly Presidium was held at 10:00 AM on the 22nd, chaired by Kong Xiangxi. Thirty-one members were present. After reporting the minutes of the previous meeting, the meeting proceeded to discuss the draft standard procedures for implementing the Constitution, and Bai Zongxi was appointed as the chairman of the 15th National Assembly.

(10) The National Assembly representatives who drafted this Constitution have the responsibility to promote the implementation of the Constitution, and their term of office shall last until the next National Assembly convenes. (11) The National Assembly representatives who drafted the Constitution shall organize a Constitution Implementation Supervision and Promotion Association, and the measures for its operation shall be determined by the National Government.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] The 25th meeting of the National Assembly Presidium was held at 6:00 PM on the 22nd, chaired by Li Daming. The resolutions were as follows: (1) The 16th National Assembly will be held at 9:30 AM on the 23rd, chaired by Gu Zhenggang. (2) The 17th National Assembly will be held at 3:00 PM on the 23rd.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] The National Assembly is proceeding smoothly in recent days and is expected to not be postponed again. As the end of the year is approaching, the representatives are preparing to return home. China and Central Aviation Companies have prepared special flights to transport representatives to Ping, Tianjin, Hankou, Chongqing, and Guangzhou. The two companies will also suspend the sale of passenger tickets between Nanjing and Shanghai from the 25th to the 27th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] More than half of the Constitution draft articles have been read for the second time. The National Assembly is about to close. It is reported that Hu Shi has scheduled to leave Nanjing for Beiping on the 26th to handle university affairs at Peking University. In addition, the Ministry of Transportation has also made appropriate arrangements for the National Assembly representatives' air tickets, and the fares are uniformly discounted by 20%.</p>
<h3>Second Reading of Constitution Draft More Than Halfway Through, Articles 54 to 82 Mostly Discussed and Passed</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] The 15th National Assembly was held at 3:40 PM on the 22nd. At the opening of the meeting, 1,352 representatives were present, later increasing to 1,400. Chaired by Bai Chongxi, the reporter read the minutes of the 14th meeting. Starting from Article 54 of Chapter 5, "Administration," the second reading procedure continued, discussing the amendments to the Constitution and the amendments proposed by the representatives in accordance with Article 24 of the Rules of Procedure. Passed without objection. For Article "56," Representative Zhao Zimao and 35 others proposed an amendment to limit the term of Acting President Liu of the Executive Yuan to three months, in order to prevent the Legislative Yuan's right of consent from becoming void and the danger of "second-rate figures" presiding over important administrative duties for a long time. However, after discussion and voting, it was rejected and the original text was passed. Articles "57" and "58" were passed without objection. Regarding Article "59," Representative Ju Zheng spoke, arguing that the original Constitution draft should not delete the point that the Executive Yuan submits amnesty cases to the Legislative Yuan. He said: "Since the eight years of the War of Resistance, there have been many legal restrictions, and political recovery has not yet been on the right track. There are many people who have committed crimes, and prisons everywhere are overcrowded. The Judicial Yuan has requested the issuance of an amnesty decree, but due to legislative procedures, it has not yet been completed, and there is no way to resolve it. Everyone should pay attention to this difficult fact in the judicial field and understand the people, and reserve this power for the government." After Ju's speech, Chairman Bai declared: The Presidium will temporarily reserve its opinion on this issue. The representatives then questioned how great the power of the Presidium was? Then Representative Pan Gongzhan spoke in the chaos, believing that this was not a question of reservation, but a question of whether to submit a reconsideration motion. Chairman Bai replied: If you want to reconsider and change the review report, please formally submit it in accordance with the rules of procedure. The original text was still passed by vote. Articles 60 and 61 were passed without objection. In Chapter 6, "Legislation," Articles 62 and 63 were passed without objection. In Article 64, "The Legislative Yuan may accept petitions from the people," Representative Chen Guyuan and 35 others proposed an amendment, arguing that the people's right to petition was already broadly stipulated in Article 17. If special provisions are made for the Legislative Yuan, it would be restrictive, and the provision "may accept" is unreasonable and should be deleted. The result of the vote was passed by an absolute majority of 1,069 votes, and the article was deleted. In Article 65, regarding the provisions for the number of Legislative Yuan members produced in the first electoral districts, there were two amendments: one was proposed by Representative Fu Sinian and 45 others, stating that in order to take into account that the number of Legislative Yuan members was too large and it was easy to cause difficulties, it was requested to change the number to five for those with a population of less than five million (originally three million), and for provinces with more than five million, add one member for every two million (originally one million). The other was proposed by Representative Zhao Pei and 36 others, in order to avoid the malpractice of Legislative Yuan members from a few provinces with large populations manipulating the meeting, it was requested to change the Legislative Yuan members elected according to the population ratio to one member for every three million (originally one million). After Zhao and Fu explained the reasons, Liu Zhendong and others successively stated their opposition. Pu Ru also stood up several times in the upper seating area, but did not get a chance to speak. The atmosphere at the meeting became tense. Chairman Bai responded to the requests of some attendees and submitted the matter to a vote. As a result, Fu's amendment received 565 votes, and Zhao's amendment received 326 votes, both of which were rejected, and the article remained as originally drafted. Articles 66 to 72 and other six articles (the original Article 68 was deleted) were passed without objection. Regarding Article 73, Representative Shi Shangkuan and 34 others proposed an amendment, believing that in addition to the Executive Yuan, the Examination Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, and the Control Yuan should be allowed to attend meetings of the Legislative Yuan regarding legal cases under their jurisdiction. After voting, it was passed by a majority of 947 votes, and the article was amended to: "When the Legislative Yuan is in session, the heads of the (original: Executive) Yuan and various ministries related to (original: administration) may attend to state their opinions." Articles 74 to 78 and other five articles were passed without objection. At 5:00 PM, there was a 20-minute break, and then the meeting continued. Regarding Article 79, Representative Ni Bi and 34 others and Representative Zhang Mian and 31 others proposed two amendments, both intending to amend it to: "Legislative Yuan members shall not be arrested or detained without the permission of the Legislative Yuan, except for current offenders (adding six words below) and those who have been prosecuted." After discussion and voting, it was rejected, and the original text was maintained by an absolute majority of 1,058 votes. Regarding Article 80, Representative Zhang Zhongdao and 35 others proposed an amendment, intending to amend it to "Legislative Yuan members (adding four words below) shall not concurrently hold (adding three words below) or transfer to official positions during their term of office." After Zhang explained the case, it was supported by the attendees, but after voting, it received 602 votes and was still rejected by a minority. Article 81 was passed without objection. In Chapter 7, "Judiciary," Article 82, regarding the issue of disciplinary power over civil servants, caused debate. Representative Gu Fengxiang and 58 others proposed amendments to this article and Article 95, arguing that this power belongs to the Control Yuan. Representative Zhang Shiwu and others agreed, believing that the power of the Control Yuan in the current Constitution draft is too small and should be supplemented with disciplinary power in order to achieve a balance of five powers. Then Wei Tingsheng spoke in a hoarse voice to oppose it. After voting, the amendment only received 341 votes, and the original text was passed by a large majority of 1,058 votes. At this point, at 6:00 PM, the discussion was stopped, and Secretary-General Hong reported that a general meeting would be held on the 23rd in the morning and afternoon. The Presidium gathered to discuss after the meeting, and then the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3>Tens of Thousands of Communist Troops Fleeing to Northern Jiangsu, Liaocheng in Shandong Bombarded by Artillery, Situation Critical</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 22nd] It is widely rumored here that the Communist army will launch a new offensive in the near future to besiege Jinan. According to a certain military observer: Jinan is the heart of Shandong, and the Jiaoji Railway is the only major artery traversing east and west Shandong. In terms of strategy, capturing Jinan would be heard at home and abroad, demonstrating the strength and determination of the Communist Party. A certain third party continues to wave the flag and shout for the Communist Party. In terms of tactics, capturing Jinan would lead to the collapse of the Jiaoji Railway, and the entire Shandong would fall into its hands. If Shandong cannot be defended, the Communist army could go north to Beiping and Tianjin, forming a confrontation with the National Army, or go south to Jiangnan, forming a sweeping trend. The Communist army in Ji and Yu are moving towards northern and western Shandong. Liu Bocheng has entered Dezhou. The main force of the Communist army in northern Jiangsu and Chen Yi's troops are fleeing back to southern Shandong. The Communist army is actively conscripting soldiers in the liberated areas of Shandong. All men aged 15 to 50 and women aged 16 to 40 are forcibly enlisted, indicating that their intentions are not small. However, this is just the Communist army's wishful thinking. Under the leadership of Commander Wang, Jinan has already overcome the most difficult 16 months in the past. Now it has sufficient strength, the people are stable, and military and political orders have been unified. It is only limited by the government's repeated tolerance (ceasefire order) constraints, and it is impossible to take the initiative militarily. If the Communist army overestimates its capabilities, it will only see its own destruction.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 22nd] Zaohe (eight miles south of Yaowan) in Pi County was captured by the Communist army on the morning of the 22nd. In addition, more than 50,000 Communist troops recently fled from southern Shandong to northern Jiangsu, with many Japanese mixed in.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 22nd] Liu Bocheng's troops of the Communist army have changed their tactics, abandoning the occupation of cities, controlling areas, and ordering the armed forces under their jurisdiction to be reorganized into local guerrillas to prepare for a major guerrilla war.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 22nd] Since the Jiaoji Railway was opened to traffic on the 16th, it has been unobstructed except for a temporary disruption by the Communist army near Lancun, which was quickly repaired.</p>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 22nd] The war situation in northern Jiangsu is about to enter its final stage. The National Army has recovered Xin'an Town, approaching Muyang County, which is tantamount to tightening the northern pocket. The Communist army in northern Jiangsu that has not retreated into Shandong Province seems to be completely surrounded.</p>
<p>[Our Qianjiang Dispatch, 22nd] It is reported that: (1) On the morning of the 22nd, more than 20,000 Communist troops from Shentangzao attacked Xinxingchang from the south.

Commander Fu does not advocate the use of force for the demobilization of the Mongolian banners. He has decided to send people to various places to appease them.

Dian Zhuangming (Mongolian) has been sent to Huade to appease the Mongolian banners in northwestern Chahar, and personnel to be sent to Lingyuan to appease the Mongolian banners in northeastern Chahar are currently being selected. At present, the four banners of Chahar, including the Bordered Yellow Banner, Shangdu Taibus Temple Left Wing, and Taibus Temple Right Wing, have no Communist troops and have begun demobilization work. Demobilization in other banners is still out of the question. The purpose of Ma's demobilization this time is to request the central government to allocate emergency relief funds for the Mongolian banners and to make suggestions on Mongolian personnel.</p>

<h3>Franco-Vietnamese Conflict Intensifies: Warfare Spreads to the Entire Tonkin Region; Viet Minh Spokesperson Declares Readiness to Die Unyielding</h3>
<p>[Agencia France-Presse, Hanoi, 22nd] According to news from here: The fighting in Hanoi has now spread to the entire Tonkin region. As of last month, 50 French soldiers in Hanoi have been killed, and another 150 have been wounded. Several Europeans and Eurasians have also died or gone missing. In Phan Lang, Guan An, Ba Ninh, and Nam Dinh, French troops have recovered their original positions, but the fighting continues unabated. In the past 48 hours, several sections of the highway from Hanoi to Haiphong have been cut off, and Guhua City was also attacked on the night Hanoi was attacked. There has been no fighting in Da Nang, largely due to the strong French military presence and the presence of French warships in the port. In Yi'an City, the Viet Minh authorities have issued an ultimatum to the French representatives, demanding that French troops surrender their arms. It is reported that General Morlière, the commander of the French forces in Tonkin, has agreed to accept the ultimatum to prevent the massacre of French nationals in the city.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] The Foreign Ministry officially announced today that the Viet Minh forces in the Tonkin and Annam regions of Vietnam have been completely cleared by French forces this afternoon. The Hanoi Public Charity Hospital has been occupied by French troops. The Viet Minh forces have been completely routed and have no more offensive capabilities. The French also suffered many casualties.</p>
<p>[Agencia France-Presse, Hanoi, 21st] Vietnamese regular troops and militia are still holding the General Post Office, but French troops are still clearing other areas of Hanoi. Residential areas that had been destroyed have been cleared, but there are still snipers appearing from time to time, which is still enough to pose a danger. The Doumer Bridge over the Red River was damaged yesterday and is currently being repaired. There is no more fighting in the Chinese quarter, and the Chinese Consul General is safe and sound. French military commander General Morlière met with the Chinese Consul General in the afternoon. The French casualties were 30 dead and 80 wounded.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Algiers, 21st] Units of the 25th Parachute Division of the French Army stationed in Tunisia will soon be transferred to Vietnam to reinforce the French forces there.</p>
<p>[Agencia France-Presse, Paris, 22nd] This morning, editorials in most French newspapers demanded that the French government take a hard-line approach to Vietnam. Even the communist "L'Humanité" newspaper, which opposes the use of force, reiterated its intention for French troops to remain in Vietnam. The People's Republican Party newspaper emphasized the news of Japanese soldiers participating in the Viet Minh forces' fighting and blamed Viet Minh President Ho Chi Minh.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 21st] A Viet Minh spokesperson told a reporter for the National Evening News today that if the war continues, Vietnam will not be preserved. "We will destroy everything and die unyielding." If the Viet Minh is not satisfied with the French government's implementation of the investigation, it will appeal to the United Nations and continue to fight at the same time. Hanoi, the capital of the Viet Minh Republic, with its once quiet roads, is now crisscrossed with trenches and obstacles. Many houses in the Viet Minh residential area are burning. A French military bulletin described the local situation as a continuous street fighting scenario. After a terrifying night of rain, the fighting is still widespread, and there have been several cases of Europeans being killed or kidnapped.</p>
<h3>Vietnamese Separatists Plan to Form "National Front Government"</h3>
<p>U.S. Denies Claim that Vietnam Requested Intervention in Franco-Vietnamese Conflict</p>
<p>[Agencia France-Presse, Nanjing, 22nd] Mo Yingdongdan, the leader of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party and former foreign minister of the Viet Minh Republican National Government, is currently in Nanjing, residing with several other Nationalist Party leaders in a small Chinese-style hotel across from the Foreign Ministry building. Mr. Ge told this agency's reporter today that the Vietnamese "National Front Government" has been formed and will be announced at an appropriate time. Mr. Ge declined to disclose the location of the new government, but it is likely to be in China, possibly in Nanjing. Mr. Ge is likely to serve as prime minister or foreign minister, or both. The four major policies of the new government are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The United States and China should mediate to begin negotiations with France and guarantee that any agreement that may be reached in the future will be implemented immediately.</p>
<p>(2) The Viet Minh must become a truly free state within the institutions of the Vietnam Federation and the French Federation, and must have the right to send diplomatic representatives. Its territory must extend south to the 16th parallel north latitude, i.e., in addition to Tonkin, it should also include central Annam and Cochinchina. (According to its provisions, only Laos and Cambodia would remain as territories of the Vietnam Federation outside the Viet Minh Republic.)</p>
<p>(3) The Viet Minh must have an appropriate proportion of representatives in the Vietnam Federation Council. The chairman of the council will be French, but his power should be purely representative, like a British Commissioner in Australia.</p>
<p>(4) French troops may occupy certain specific locations within the territory of the Viet Minh, which will be determined by mutual agreement, and French troops must withdraw from those locations within five years. All French economic and cultural interests in the Viet Minh territory will be faithfully guaranteed by the Viet Minh government.</p>
<p>Mr. Ge and his colleagues withdrew from Ho Chi Minh's coalition government because they were unwilling to participate in the Franco-Vietnamese negotiations. Mr. Wan accused Ho Chi Minh, saying that the Franco-Vietnamese negotiations in Fontainebleau, France, in September of this year broke down, and the Vietnamese representatives were first sent back to the country, but Ho Chi Minh signed a provisional agreement with the French side alone, losing credibility with the people. Furthermore, Ho Chi Minh is not trusted by the people because of his close ties to the Communist Party. The order to dissolve the Communist Party in January of this year was merely a formality, and Ho Chi Minh still takes orders from Moscow. The Ho Chi Minh government will resign sooner or later and be replaced by the newly organized "National Government" to find ways to contact Nanjing and Washington to request mediation.</p>
<p>[Agencia France-Presse, Washington, 21st] The State Department has denied reports that representatives of the Viet Minh government in Vietnam have requested the U.S. government to intervene in the Franco-Vietnamese conflict.</p>
<h3>French Colonial Minister Flies to Vietnam, Soon to Visit Chairman Chiang in China</h3>

<h3>Qian Changzhao Reports to the Provincial Assembly: Prospects for Ten Enterprises in Taiwan; Pre-war Production Levels Will Definitely Be Restored in Three Years</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 22nd] Qian Changzhao, Chairman of the Resources Committee, gave a detailed report to the Joint Provincial Assembly on the ten enterprises operated independently or jointly by the Committee in Taiwan on the 21st. He first clarified that state-owned enterprises and private enterprises should complement each other and that there is no conflict between the two. He emphasized that the economic construction of Taiwan must be able to coordinate with the whole country. He then described the prospects for the ten enterprises as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Petroleum: The repair work has reached 90%, and 16,000 barrels of crude oil can be refined daily by January next year.</p>
<p>(2) Lead Industry: The damage is severe, and the repairs are difficult. However, the first phase of work will be completed in October next year, with an annual output of 8,000 tons of lead ingots. After the second phase of work, the annual output of 24,000 tons will be completed by the end of the year.</p>
<p>(3) Gold and Copper: The goal of the first phase is to produce 300 tons of gold ore and 45 tons of sediment daily, which is expected to be completed within four months. Cooperation with Canada is currently being discussed for the aluminum and copper industries to leverage their capital and technology.</p>
<p>(4) Electricity: When received, the power generation capacity was 42,000 kilowatts. It has now reached 183,000 kilowatts. The goal of 200,000 kilowatts can be reached by February next year. If the plan for the 36th year of the Republic of China can be completed as scheduled, it will increase by 300,000 kilowatts.</p>
<p>(5) Sugar Industry: There was no production when it was received. When I came to Taiwan last time, 86,000 tons of sugar had been produced from existing sugarcane. Repairs are now being stepped up, and sugarcane is being actively planted. 100,000 tons of sugar can be produced in the 36th year of the Republic of China. The output will gradually increase to 1 million tons in three years.</p>
<p>(6) Fertilizer: When I came to Taiwan last time, major products such as phosphate fertilizer and nitrogen fertilizer were not produced. Now phosphate fertilizer can reach an annual output of 25,000 tons, and nitrogen fertilizer can reach an annual salt content of 9,600 tons. It is predicted that the former will reach 42,000 tons and the latter will produce 12,000 tons by next year. Recently, with the assistance of the Executive Yuan, it is hoped that the output can reach more than 200,000 tons in the year after next.</p>
<p>(7) Alkali Production: The main products are caustic soda, soda powder, and hydrochloric acid, and production is also increasing. In the future, it is planned to use Japanese reparations equipment to actively expand production.</p>
<p>(8) Cement: The Kaohsiung plant currently produces 11,000 tons per month, and the Su'ao plant produces 4,000 tons, for a total monthly output of 16,000 tons. It is now planned to purchase more machines, supplement equipment, and build a light railway at the Zhudong plant to complete the goal of an annual output of 4.2 million barrels.</p>
<p>(9) Paper Mills: There was no production at all factories when they were received. Production was still low when I came to Taiwan last time. Now it is gradually increasing. It is estimated that by next year, the total daily output of all factories will be 42 tons of paper and 35 tons of pulp.</p>
<p>(10) Machinery and Shipbuilding: There are the Long and Kaohsiung plants. When I came to Taiwan last time, only sugar-making machinery was produced. Now the output of sugar-making machinery has gradually increased, and the production of other heavy oil engines and wooden ships is also being stepped up. However, the equipment is poor. In the future, it is planned to use Japanese reparations equipment to enable large-scale ship repairs and build ships of 3,000 to 4,000 tons.</p>
<p>Mr. Qian also said that the original capital invested by the people of Taiwan Province in various enterprises will be recognized if it complies with national laws and regulations. The participation of private capital is also welcome in some enterprises without private shares. Finally, he affirmed to the Taiwan Provincial Assembly that the restoration plan of the above-mentioned enterprises will take two years for some and three years for others. I believe that in three years, the production level of the Japanese before the war will definitely be restored. Some enterprises, such as petroleum, aluminum, fertilizer, and shipbuilding, will definitely exceed it. The future economic construction of Taiwan will definitely be more scaled than in the Japanese era.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 22nd] Qian Changzhao, accompanied by business committee members Sun Zheng, Hong Zhong, Zhang Jun, and Lu Yuwen, flew to Guangzhou by special plane at 11:00 a.m. today.

Starting in February, four additional round-trip trains will be added from Xuzhou to Zhengzhou. The engineering train for the Shitian Line has been opened. Freight transport will be restored first on the entire line next month, and passenger tickets will not be sold for the time being.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Puppets Had a Secret Prison in Lv Yuan, Changchun; War Criminal Fujita Confesses</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 22nd] War criminal Fujita Kanichi was originally the intelligence chief of Doihara. The Changchun War Criminals Investigation Committee confessed during the interrogation of the prisoner yesterday afternoon that there was a secret prison 20 miles outside the suburbs of Changchun. The building is a steel-reinforced concrete structure, with brick walls about ten feet high on all sides. There are 25 single rooms and an ancient well. In the past, young "ideological prisoners" were executed with extreme punishment. Although it is now desolate, it is still filled with murderous intent. [Central News Agency, Changchun, 22nd] The Changchun War Criminal Investigation Committee interrogated Fujita Kanichi, a Japanese war criminal who served as an intelligence officer under Doihara and was entrusted by the Puppet Manchukuo Medical Affairs Bureau, yesterday morning. The prisoner confessed to the horrifying secret prison and chemical research institute of Changchun during the Puppet Manchukuo era. The site is near Luyuan, surrounded by open space. The War Criminal Investigation Committee immediately sent personnel to Luyuan with the prisoner for verification. The results confirmed that the place was indeed the secret interrogation prison that was generally known by name but not by location. It is said that during the Puppet Manchukuo era, the houses of the secret prison and chemical research institute were surrounded by a ten-foot-high charcoal-colored brick wall. Trees were planted around the wall. The courtyard was about 100 meters in diameter. When the communist army entered Changchun, the surrounding walls and trees were all destroyed. Only the windows and doors of the prison and chemical research institute houses remain. Inside, there are single cells and guard rooms. There are a total of twenty-five single cells. The single cells are still largely intact, but the rooms are filled with a gloomy atmosphere. It is unknown how many patriots starved to death in them at that time. The chemical research institute has a total of four houses, upstairs and downstairs. The internal facilities are divided into electrified chemical interrogation rooms, etc. Broken electric meters and wires still remain in the electrical research room. There are two laboratory benches and two electric wires in the chemical research room, and traces of various chemicals are everywhere. The internal equipment of the interrogation room has been completely destroyed.</p>
<h3>Statistical Society Holds Annual Meeting; President Issues Instructions to Encourage Continuous Improvement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The 13th Annual Meeting of the Chinese Statistical Society was held at Huiling Middle School on the 22nd. More than 100 people attended, including Zheng Yan'an, Zhu Junyi, Chu Yifei, and Shou Miancheng. The President of the Village Research Association delivered a speech at the meeting and respectfully read Chairman Chiang's instructions. Then, Director of Budget, Accounting, and Statistics Xu Kan gave a speech, stating: "All national administrations need statistical data as a basis. The Budget, Accounting, and Statistics Office also needs reasonable and accurate statistical data for reference when preparing budgets." He also proposed three points for the connection between the Statistics Office and the Statistical Society. At 11:00 a.m., papers were read, including Zhu Junyi's "Discussion on the Naming of Large Numbers in China" and Zheng Yao's "Preliminary Discussion on Improving Tax Revenue through Statistical Survey Methods in France," and more than ten other papers. After taking a group photo and having lunch at 12:30 p.m., the reading of papers continued. From 2:00 p.m., there were reports on society affairs, discussions of proposals, and elections of directors and supervisors. The meeting ended at 6:00 p.m. The full text of Chairman Chiang's instructions is as follows:</p>
<p>In February of the 30th year of the Republic of China, the Budget, Accounting, and Statistics Office of the National Government held its first plenary meeting, and I once said in my speech: "The three important classifications of budget, accounting, and statistics business are budget, accounting, and statistics. Budget is related to assessment, accounting complements execution, and statistics is the basis for design. This is closely related to the three procedures of design, execution, and assessment in administration." I also said: "Statistical business is the source of information for determining plans for political construction and economic construction. It should be accelerated and its content should be improved." From this significance, we can know the importance of statistics to national construction. However, appointment depends on talent, and talent originates from knowledge. Today, you gentlemen are gathered together as a society for statistical science. You should conduct thorough research on statistical theories and statistical problems. Generally speaking, it is easy to compile statistical matters clearly, but it is difficult to be accurate and precise. It is easy to do it in the central government, but it is difficult to do it locally. If you want to seek self-division and combine the net, you can only achieve this if those in charge are single-minded and technically excellent, so that the statistics of our country will be improved to meet the needs. This is the basis for all great national plans, and I have great hopes for you.</p>

<h3>Removal of Industrial Equipment in Northeast China Deepens Discord Between the United States and the Soviet Union; U.S. Newspaper Comments on Pauley's Investigation Report</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 21st] The Times of Maine commented on Pauley's final report on the Northeast, stating that the removal of factories in Northeast China has further deepened the discord between the United States and the Soviet Union on such policy issues. The Soviet Union clearly stated that such industrial equipment belonged to Japan, and therefore was part of the spoils of war. If this view is based on an ambiguous interpretation of the various agreements we have made, it is sufficient to prove the lack of appropriate contact between the military leaders or diplomatic representatives of the two countries. The newspaper continued: "The past may not be pursued." But this kind of mutual demand and policy conflict will never end. If we want it to end, we must try our best to reach a comprehensive understanding with the Soviet Union on the Far East issue. The Soviet Union will eventually realize that it faces the same or even greater dangers in China and the Northwest Pacific as we do.</p>

<h3>Top Traitor Ma Liang Sentenced to Long-Term Imprisonment</h3>

When the puppet provincial government was established, he served as the puppet governor.</p>
<h3>Editorial: Tax Reduction Movement</h3>
<p>City councilors Chen Weijian and others have proposed reducing taxes and fees to alleviate the burden on the people, which is a matter worthy of public attention. At a time when the treasury is empty and resources are exhausted, hoping for immediate results is, frankly, easier said than done. However, the problem is indeed very serious. As the original proposal states, "Not only will social order be disrupted, but it will also affect national chaos," which is not an exaggeration. Here, let's briefly list a few of the current unreasonable tax collection practices to arouse public attention.</p>
<p>(1) Too Heavy: In ancient times, the "one-tenth" tax was levied, and when it reached two-tenths, it was already felt that the people's strength could not bear it. Now, however, under the names of luxury, consumption, entertainment, etc., it is often levied at 40%, 50%, or even 100% for every 100, or 200% for every 100. In addition to taking all the profits, half of it is added to the levy. Speaking of the principles of taxation, what principles can be discussed here? It is nothing more than drinking poison to quench thirst, killing the chicken to get the eggs, just to meet the urgent needs. But "if the people are not sufficient, with whom shall you be sufficient?" When the source of tax revenue reaches the point of exhaustion, many unemployed people in society are added to the ranks of those in need of relief, and countless unscrupulous elements are added to the prisons who take risks. The state only adds to the burden. In the end, who gains and who loses? Just look a little further and everyone can see it.</p>
<p>(2) Too Complicated: Recently, when the Hubei Provincial Assembly convened, a certain councilor stated that merchants in Hankou had to pay more than 30 kinds of taxes and fees every month, almost having to pay a tax or fee every day. This is a practical proof of the current excessive complexity of taxes and fees. In fact, inventing excuses and levying taxes arbitrarily is not limited to Hankou alone, it's just that no one has statistically accounted for it elsewhere.</p>
<p>(3) Too Hypocritical: There are many methods of collecting money that superficially always use some high-sounding reasons as a guise, thus creating many forms and procedures. For example, registration, certification, stamping, licensing, inspection, etc. In addition to the certificate, a guarantee is also required; and the paper costs money, the registration costs money, and the license costs money. It goes without saying that a license costs money, but even copying, inspecting, reporting loss, reissuing, etc., all cost money, which seems a little unreasonable. We do not deny that there are several of these that seem necessary in law. But there are many others that have no other effect than to increase government revenue. If it is only for the purpose of investigation and statistics, then there is no need to spend so much effort. If it is to protect certain rights and interests, and it is said that it must go through such procedures to be legally protected, then it seems questionable whether legal protection must go through such procedures. In other words, without these procedures, the law may not completely reject it. As far as we can see, it is rare for these registrations, certifications, inspections... etc. to be fully completed on time. Our view is that if it is for the sake of income, then the procedures can be omitted and taxes can be collected directly and happily in accordance with the regulations. The public can gain real benefits, and the people can avoid being disturbed.</p>
<p>(4) Too Unreasonable: This includes too many organizing agencies and too many officials, so that most of the income is completely used for collection fees, so that the public does not get real benefits. Moreover, there are many tax items that are too fragmented, and although the effort is diligent, the effect is minimal. As for stacking beds on top of houses, double taxation on one item, tax A is not finished, tax B is coming again, taxing the present and also tracing back to the past, etc., we believe that are all unreasonable.</p>
<p>(5) Too Clumsy: Some people think that Chinese officials are best at extortion, but this is only one side of the story. In the past, there were some taxes and fees that could only be contracted out to merchants or recognized by various industries because the official management was too poor, which shows that their collection techniques were not very clever. Although this situation has gradually decreased now, the regulations are too complicated, and there are too many procedures. Many new tax rules are too cumbersome, so that taxpayers have nowhere to go but to consult specialists such as accountants to handle them on their behalf. Even the collection personnel feel that the content is too complicated, and if they were to follow it closely and handle it one by one, it would inevitably be a waste of money and time. Therefore, under the slogan of sympathizing with the difficulties of merchants, many simplified and flexible methods of tax collection have emerged. It is said that some of them are quite close to contracting out. This method can save taxpayers some trouble, and we do not want to criticize it too much. What is strange is that since simplification is known, why is the legislation so strict? Since the legislation is so strict, how can it be simplified? This is really a difficult problem to solve.</p>
<p>In view of this, the proposal to reduce taxes and fees submitted by Councilor Chen and others is quite complex and should not only be satisfied with reducing the number of tax items. All tax rates, tax rules, and even tax systems should be investigated clearly and the government should be asked to make reasonable adjustments.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are a few points that are directly related to this case and are also worth mentioning. First, new taxes and fees should not be created rashly. In particular, they should not be created freely by administrative agencies. Now that people's opinion organs have been established everywhere, they must be submitted to the relevant people's opinion organs for formal approval before they can be announced in accordance with the law. Because various taxes and fees often have a very appealing reason at the beginning of their announcement and implementation, and it is said that this is a temporary nature and will be cancelled once the deadline expires, but in fact it is very easy to promulgate and very difficult to cancel. For example, the banquet tax and hotel tax, which are now the main sources of income for this city, were originally a kind of voluntary donation for relieving refugees. Who knew that after the situation changed, they would become a reliable source of regular income for the local area. Whether the so-called municipal construction donation can be terminated on schedule is now another question. Therefore, creating new taxes and fees is indeed a very serious issue and should not be taken lightly. Second, any tax or fee should not be labeled with the name of its purpose. For example, construction donation, health donation, education donation, etc. Because the principle of finance is to emphasize unified collection and expenditure, the original budget may already include such expenses. If it is indeed insufficient, it can be considered and made up for by giving priority to the most urgent matters, so why bother using these good-sounding names to teach those who hold dissenting opinions to risk being accused of sabotage and destruction. Third, the agencies that use the funds should not collect and spend the money directly. The abuse of this matter is the greatest, and the embezzlement is the most. In today's era of independent accounting and independent auditing, it seems that there is very little possibility. But in fact, it can be seen everywhere.</p>
<p>To rectify officialdom and reduce the suffering of the people, nothing is more important than rectifying finance. To rectify finance, of course, we should start with improving the private system and eliminating unreasonable tax rates and tax items. Therefore, we express our warm sympathy for the proposal of Councilor Chen and others.</p>

<h3>An Interlude in the Hankou Municipal Reorganization Issue: A Dispute Between the City Council and the Provincial Government</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hankou News] The Hankou Municipal Reorganization issue has caused a pointless dispute between the City Council and the Provincial Government, with both sides going from verbal arguments to written battles. The reason is that on the opening day of the Hankou City Council (16th), Councilor Hu Wenhui criticized the Provincial Government for opposing the issue of Hankou Municipality being reorganized into a Directly Controlled Municipality in his reply, and accused Chairman Wan of making arbitrary decisions. Yu Zhengdong, the director of the department representing Chairman Wan who was present at the time, did not make any statement. Afterwards, because reporters interviewed him, he said that the councilor's attitude was inappropriate, which aroused the anger of all the councilors, who jointly sent a letter to Director Yu, requesting an explanation of the "inappropriate" words. The spokesperson of the Provincial Government also issued a written statement, saying: The issue of Hankou City being reorganized into a Directly Controlled Municipality should be decided by the Central Government. The City Council can make suggestions to the government at the same level in accordance with its organizational regulations, and forward them to the Central Government for approval. The Provincial Government can also submit its opinions to the Central Government for reference. At the opening of the Hankou City Council, Councilor Hu actually used a "harsh tone" and a "furious" attitude in his reply, and said in a scolding tone that the Provincial Government's "views were confused" and "asked" Chairman Wan to "put more effort into studying Hubei's politics, economy, culture, and transportation, and make fewer unnecessary claims." It can be seen that this is purely a matter of loyalty. As for the City Council's letter to Director Yu, who represents the Chairman of the Provincial Government, requesting an explanation of the word "inappropriate," the City Council has no right to question the Provincial Government according to law, and its writing procedures are not in accordance with the regulations of the Executive Yuan's Dian (電) No. 1, Yang (養) Wu (午) 34th year, so there is no need to reply. This can also be said to be a small wave in the voice of democracy.</p>
<h3>Anhui Provincial Councilors Question Provincial Affairs, Request Severe Punishment for Three County Magistrates Who Sabotaged People's Opinion Organs, No This Year's Land Tax Will Be Levied in Seven Counties in Northeastern Anhui</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hefei 22nd News] The 21st was the second day of the second session of the Anhui Provincial Council.

After the report, the inquiry began, and the councilors spoke enthusiastically. Fan Peike fired the first shot, saying that a large number of students were recruited and trained by various cadre training groups. This is military shareholding. After the election in the future, how will these cadre training students find a way out? Is this misleading Anhui children? In addition, there are as many as 160 inspectors from various departments of the Provincial Government. Their task is equivalent to "Gentlemen (reporting good things to heaven and ensuring peace in the lower world)," what is the use of this? As for clarifying officialdom, it is hoped that the Provincial Government will make a big move next year, and only ask whether the Provincial Government has the determination. Ding Jixian said that many county magistrates who stepped down often came to the province to "become inspectors." Some of them have not cleared their accounts and are still swaying in various counties. Are these county magistrates who have not cleared their accounts becoming inspectors, is the Provincial Government protecting them? It is hoped that these inspectors will be immediately dismissed. Chen Tianren asked that the disaster situation in northeastern Anhui is unprecedented in the past 60 years, and spring cultivation next spring is the most serious problem. Why does the Provincial Government not include it in next year's central work? Tong Chunxuan said that the census is not accurate at all. There are many people who report more and less. The census takers have money to spend, so they don't care. Therefore, there is a news headline: "The census takes three months, drinking, playing cards, and making money." Please ask the Provincial Government to conduct a thorough investigation and improvement. He Zhao, Sun Yuhang, Chu Zuoshi, Yin Yingji, Wu Detang, etc. all made suggestions on the current unreasonable situation in various counties. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon. There were more than a dozen written inquiries, and Su promised to reply in writing. At 2:00 p.m., before the civil affairs report, a temporary motion was made: (1) Please the Provincial Government severely punish the three county magistrates of Taihe, Guangde, and Qingyang who sabotaged people's opinion organs. (2) Please ask the Provincial Government not to arbitrarily order the levy of this year's land tax in Xuyi, Tianchang, Wuhe, Suxian, Sixian, Lingbi, and Fengyang counties. (3) Telegraph the Relief Administration to set up a relief hospital in northeastern Anhui, which was unanimously passed. Then, Huang Tongchou, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, reported on civil affairs, which was divided into ten major departments. After the report, councilors Sun Yuhang, Cheng Binji, and Pan Yusan all advocated abolishing the Special Protection Commissioner's Office and the District Office, especially Pan Yusan, who was the most激昂. He asked why he did not list the health medicines and equipment in the report, where did those things go? The Provincial Keqing Hospital killed a patient with an injection, what kind of hospital is this? Shi Guoying asked why he had never seen inspectors come to the townships when the village and town chiefs were corrupt and fraudulent. Huang Tongchou replied verbally, and the meeting adjourned at 5:30 p.m. The financial report will be held tomorrow morning, and the construction report will be held in the afternoon.</p>

The farmers in each township are delaying and waiting to see what happens, resulting in poor quality. If the government urges them to pay taxes like wildfire, it will inevitably make the guilds unable to bear the compensation.

<h3>British Ultimatum Expires Tonight, Albania Submits Reply, Yugoslavia Denies Supplying Mines to Albania</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 22nd Broadcast: The British Foreign Office has announced that regarding the October 22nd mine explosion off the Albanian coast that damaged two British destroyers, the British government sent a note to Albania requesting an explanation. The Albanian Chargé d'Affaires delivered Albania's reply to the British Ambassador to Albania, Baker, on Saturday night. The British note set a deadline for Albania to respond by Monday night, stating that if the response was not deemed satisfactory, Britain would submit the case to the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 21st, United Press] According to semi-official Yugoslav sources, the rumor that Yugoslavia supplied mines to Albania is purely unfounded, as Albania does not need to obtain mines from Yugoslavia. Due to the war, the Albanian coast was mined by the German navy. Therefore, if they need mines, they can easily obtain them from their own coast.</p>
<h3>US and Soviet Occupation Authorities in Germany to Discuss German Economic Unification, Clark Appointed US Representative to Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting</h3>

<h3>Poland Replies to British Note, Accuses Britain of Breaking Promises, Friction Between the Two Countries Not Easily Resolved</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Warsaw, 22nd] The British government sent a note to the Polish government on November 22nd, requesting assurances of free elections on January 19th of next year. Today, the Polish Acting Foreign Minister delivered a reply to the British Ambassador to Poland, Bevin, accusing Britain of violating its obligations to Poland. The British note expressed concern about whether Poland would respect the Yalta and Potsdam agreements when holding future elections. The Polish reply stated that the guarantee of free elections was not only mentioned in the Yalta and Potsdam agreements but also clearly stipulated in the Polish constitution. The reply also expressed regret that Britain had failed to fulfill its promises to Poland in several areas, and particularly emphasized the following two points: (1) After the dissolution of the Polish government-in-exile in London, the British government still allowed Polish exiles to conduct guerrilla activities and retain their representatives abroad. (2) The Polish Rehabilitation Work Group was established in Britain and was beyond the authority of the Polish government. Britain still retains a certain amount of Polish gold, which, if returned, would accelerate Poland's reconstruction. Furthermore, the Polish ships seized by the British government have not yet been returned to their original owners. The Polish government hopes that the British government will further adhere to its promises.</p>
<p>Britain Further Clarifies Its Position</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] It is now known that the exchange of notes between Britain and Poland has failed to ensure that Warsaw will hold elections on the terms desired by Britain. Regarding Poland's accusations against the British government, the British government has issued the following clarification: (1) The former Polish government in London did not receive financial assistance from Britain. Its personnel enjoyed the same freedoms of speech and association as other residents in Britain. (2) The British government has promised not to force Polish soldiers who do not wish to return home to do so. Many Allied soldiers stationed abroad also do not wish to return home. (3) Regarding the formation of labor service teams, this is a matter of training militia under British law. (4) Britain and Poland reached an agreement this summer to resolve Poland's war debt. The British government's failure to ratify the agreement and its retention of Polish gold and funds in Britain are solely due to Poland's unwillingness to fulfill its promise to hold fair and free elections. The delay in sending Polish soldiers back home is due to the Polish government's inability to provide detailed records of each soldier.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 21st] A spokesman for the US State Department recently stated that the Burmese representatives are currently holding talks with the British government in London.

<h3>US to Establish Scientific Stations Throughout the Pacific Region</h3>

The scope is very broad, including public health, medicine, tropical agriculture, botany, zoology, astronomy, and oceanography. Islands in the Pacific that saw fierce fighting during the war, such as New Guinea, Saipan, and Okinawa, will all have these scientific research stations, as a way to commemorate the fallen soldiers.</p>
<h3>Britain to Recall Ambassador to Spain in Accordance with UN Resolution, Spanish Government to Also Recall Envoy</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] The British government has instructed Sir Mallet, the British Ambassador to Spain, to return home as soon as he has concluded his personal affairs. Authoritative sources say that Sir Mallet has been ordered to inform the Spanish Foreign Ministry that he has been recalled and will return home after making some arrangements. It is expected that the Spanish government will soon recall its ambassador to Britain, Cardenas.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Madrid, 22nd] Regarding rumors that Franco's Spain and Arab countries have reached an agreement to grant autonomy to Spanish Morocco, Spanish officials said today that they know nothing about it. However, neutral observers say that Franco may have made some promises to Moroccans residing in the Spanish zone in order to persuade Arab countries to adopt a neutral stance when the United Nations General Assembly votes on the Spanish issue. However, it is recognized that the time is not yet ripe to reach a conclusion. It is reported that Varela, the Spanish High Commissioner in Morocco, recently allowed three Moroccan intellectuals to go to Cairo for preliminary cultural contact with the Arab League. This gesture aims to express Franco's goodwill, as he believes that the activities of these three representatives will be limited to cultural aspects and will not involve politics. However, sources in Madrid with inside knowledge say that the activities of these three representatives have exceeded the scope of their instructions, putting the Spanish government in an awkward position. At the same time, Spanish republican exiles, with the support of the Moroccan national movement, held a meeting to guarantee that once Spain restores the republic, it will immediately grant autonomy to Spanish Morocco. Therefore, various rumors are even more confusing.</p>
<h3>Hitler's Nemesis, Anhart, Comes Out of Retirement</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Munich, 21st] Judge Dr. Anhart has been elected chairman of the new legislative assembly of Bavaria. Anhart, now 48 years old, participated in the trial after Hitler was arrested for inciting the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923 and convicted Hitler.</p>
<h3>France Plans to Reduce Army Size, Current Strength 650,000 Men</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 21st] Although France prides itself on being one of the Big Four, under Prime Minister Blum's economic plan, its military strength may be reduced to that of a second or third-rate country. The Maginot and Siegfried Lines are a thing of the past, and the German coastal defenses from Oslo to Bordeaux have been completely destroyed. France's military strength of 650,000 men, including gendarmes, marines, and the air force, is second only to Yugoslavia in continental Europe, after the Soviet Union. According to reliable intelligence estimates, Yugoslavia is the strongest of the small countries in Europe today, with a military strength of 800,000 men. The current French economic plan advocates reducing the military. An army of 300,000 men would be roughly equivalent to Franco's Spanish army or to the force that Czechoslovakia or the Netherlands could muster. Blum's attempt to form a coalition government last week failed due to military issues. The French Communist and Popular Republican parties could not agree on who should be Minister of Defense. The Communist Party refused to join Blum's cabinet without a seat in the Ministry of Defense, while the Popular Republican Party refused to consider it, claiming that the Communist Party would use a fifth column to undermine the French army. Therefore, Blum had to form a purely Socialist cabinet with a minority party, promising to save the economy by reducing public servants and the military.</p>
<h3>Supreme Soviet Passes New Budget</h3>

<h3>Madame Pandit Delivers Speech, Praises China's Stance, Says UN Work Quite Successful, Harshly Criticizes British Representative's Attitude</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 21st] Madame Pandit, head of the Indian delegation to the UN General Assembly, said in a speech at a public conference hosted by the Indian International Affairs Research Association tonight: "We have received strong support from China in the UN General Assembly and its committees. Chinese representative Dr. Wellington Koo has voted for us many times. Those who attended the meeting included Nehru, Gaffar (i.e., the Frontier Gandhi), Xue Shouheng, our representative in India, Shen Zonglian, head of our delegation to Nepal, and Merrill, the US representative in India. Madame Pandit's speech elaborated on the cooperation the Indian delegation received from representatives of other countries at the UN General Assembly. She praised the cooperation that the "Slavic bloc" gave to India, and she most emphasized the cooperation of the Soviet and Polish delegations. Her brief and prominent remarks about China showed that it was expected that the Indian representative would receive support from the Eastern countries at the General Assembly. The reason why she especially thanked Dr. Wellington Koo was to point out that China's support for India or Asian proposals at the General Assembly was very strong. She believed that the reason why the US representative could not cooperate with the Indian proposals was due to the "confusion" of US foreign policy. She expressed displeasure with the actions of the British representative at the General Assembly. Regarding the United Nations organization itself, she believed that although the United Nations organization has its weaknesses, future international disputes will be resolved by it. She pointed out that the veto power of the five major powers is necessary because the "Anglo-Saxon" countries and their satellite countries account for the vast majority.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 21st] Madame Pandit, the chief Indian delegate to the UN General Assembly, said tonight that all the opinions put forward by the Indian delegation to the United Nations General Assembly were undermined by Britain. Although the techniques used to undermine them were very secret and clever, they could not deceive anyone. The Indian delegation was fortunate to have made close contact with representatives of various Asian countries. Only the Turkish representative told me that Turkey was not interested in either Europe or Asia and only participated in the United Nations as a formality. Madame Ji said: India's victory over South Africa in the United Nations is a success of the United Nations organization. Today, India has won the sympathy of the world. After we gain complete freedom, we will be able to progress rapidly and are expected to surpass the current status of the Soviet Union in the short term.</p>

<h3>Earthquake Center in the Pacific Ocean</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 21st] The National Broadcasting Company said this afternoon that the number of deaths in the Japanese earthquake is estimated to be more than 1,500. The earthquake test at the University of Michigan could begin to detect the vibrations at 7:36 PM yesterday (standard time) and lasted for three hours. The earthquakes after 8:00 PM were extremely violent. The source of this and the major earthquakes of 1934 and 1896 were all in the Tuscarora Trench in the Pacific Ocean. This crack is 27,030 feet long and parallel to the Japanese coast.</p>
<p>[Kaizo Sha, Tokyo, 22nd] According to a statement issued by the Japanese Central Meteorological Agency, one of the largest earthquakes in the world was the earthquake in Shanxi, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces in China in 1556, during the 35th year of the Jiajing reign of the Ming Dynasty, which killed 830,000 people. The second was the great earthquake in Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, in 1755, which killed 60,000 people who were submerged by the tsunami at the time. The third was the great earthquake in San Francisco, USA, in 1906, which caused a major fire, but only killed 2,600 people. The fourth was the great earthquake in the Tokai region of Japan in 1707, which destroyed 29,000 houses and killed 4,900 people. The fifth was the Kanto earthquake in Japan in 1923, which killed about 70,000 people. Two-thirds of the houses in Tokyo were destroyed by fire, and almost all the houses in Yokohama were destroyed. The epicenter and force of this earthquake are similar to those of the great earthquake in Japan in 1707. Fortunately, the epicenter of this earthquake was at the bottom of the sea, which can be said to be a great blessing in misfortune. If it were on land, the disaster would be unknown.</p>

In addition, the newspaper also published photos showing that dance advertisements are posted on the doors and windows of several youth clubs, and various dance techniques can be practiced for a fee of 75 rubles.</p>

<h3>Three Chemical Groups Foster Friendship: Joint Annual Meeting Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Vice Premier Weng Attended and Delivered a Speech: Hoping for Practical Effort, Not Seeking Fame</p>
<p>The joint annual meeting of the Chinese Chemical Society, the Chinese Chemical Industry Society, and the Chinese Chemical Engineering Society was held at 2:00 PM yesterday at the Central Research Institute on Qiqi Road. Wu Zhihui and Li Shizeng arrived at the meeting at 2:00 PM, but left before giving a speech due to other appointments. Chairman Wu Rundong delivered a speech, saying that he was unqualified to serve as chairman since he had long been separated from the laboratory and hoped that all comrades would return to the laboratory and contribute their lives. Xu Zishi, the director of the annual meeting preparation committee, reported that the general association was originally in Nanjing, but the annual meeting was decided to be held in Shanghai. The annual meeting was initiated by the Chinese Chemical Society purely to foster friendship, jointly work hard and contribute collectively. Vice Premier Weng Wenhao rushed to the meeting at 2:30 PM and gave a speech, saying that he was actually a geologist, but he attached great importance to chemistry. He studied chemistry in 1908 and believed that the mystery of the atom could not be broken, but now the atom has been broken, showing that scientific progress is very rapid. He hoped that people would work hard and practically, and persist. After returning from abroad in the first year of the Republic of China, he engaged in geology for 24 years. Later, due to the instability of North China, he resolved to enter politics for the sake of the overall national situation and abandoned geology. He hoped to engage in industry and mining in the future and contribute his remaining years. Therefore, he hoped that his chemical colleagues would work hard and practically, without seeking fame. Once they become famous, they will definitely change careers, become officials or principals, etc. Therefore, they must have an iron will and write books. Subsequently, Gao Enbo of the Chinese Chemical Society reported that the association was officially established on August 4th, 1932, and currently has 1,986 members. The journal was published in 1933, and Chemical Communications and the Chemical World were published in 1934, continuing without interruption. Wu Yuncho of the Chinese Chemical Industry Society said that the association was established in 1922, but it was not publicized, and the outside world mistakenly thought it had stopped, which was incorrect. The Chemical Industry Journal is currently published and has raised a fund of 16 million. He said that they would take on a joint responsibility amid the collapse of industry. Gu Zhen of the Chinese Chemical Engineering Society said that it was established in 1933 and publishes the Chemical Engineering Journal and association reports. Director Zhu Jiajian did not attend in person but sent a congratulatory telegram. Finally, the group visited the Central Research Institute.</p>

It is said that Director Xuan, in order to urgently implement and promote the review of criminal case clues, has decided to formally establish the Police Museum on New Year's Day in the 36th year and open it to the public. However, its nature is different from other museums and is entirely within the scope of police affairs. All legal public organizations in the city can only be permitted to visit after submitting a written request and obtaining Director Xuan's approval.</p>
<h3>Wartime Factory Loss Registration: Investigation Work Will Take a Long Time</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] As of this time, although there are no official statistics on the registration of wartime factory property losses in the city, it is estimated that there are about 1,000 cases. After the registration is completed, the Social Bureau will compile detailed statistics and publish them publicly. According to relevant sources, only a portion of the loss registrations are accompanied by photos and other supporting documents. In the future, there will inevitably be a large-scale investigation, which will still be carried out by local authorities. Because the years have passed and the reported figures are not entirely objective, the time required for the investigation is likely to be longer than the registration. The loss figures reported by the damaged factories are based on the estimated value at the time of the damage. How to convert them into the prices of July of the 26th year and then convert them into US dollars is still to be decided by the central government. The registration period for losses has been extended twice, originally scheduled to end at the end of June, then extended to November 15th, and now extended to the end of the year. As of now, there is no news of any further extensions.</p>
<h3>Two American Merchant Ships Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The American President Lines' General Gordon and President Monroe are both scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today. The General Gordon will dock at the China Merchants Bureau's First Wharf (i.e., North Wharf), and the President Monroe will dock at the Bailianjing Dalae Wharf. Both ships will leave Shanghai on the 26th. The Monroe will travel to the South Seas, then through the Mediterranean to the Atlantic and return to the United States. The General Gordon will travel to Hong Kong and Luzon before returning to Shanghai and then to the United States.</p>
<h3>Four Hundred Blankets Distributed Daily: Public and Private School Personnel Disappointed</h3>
<p>The distribution of blankets to public and private school personnel in the city began on the 21st, distributed by the Public and Private School Personnel Supply Office, priced at 45,500 yuan per blanket. They were sold with Ziyou-numbered distribution stamps upon payment. However, the Materials Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan limited the supply to 400 blankets per day, leaving those who arrived later disappointed. More than 80,000 public and private school personnel in the city have registered with the supply office and obtained certificates. If the Materials Supply Bureau continues to limit the supply to 400 blankets per day, it will inevitably be delayed until June or July of next year before all can be distributed. It is said that the number of people requesting distribution on the 21st was too crowded, and the Materials Supply Bureau increased the distribution by 400 blankets, but it was a drop in the bucket and still did not solve the problem. Now that the weather is cold, the need for blankets is urgent, so the general public and private school personnel hope that the Materials Supply Bureau can provide a large supply and complete the distribution before the end of the year to meet the actual needs.</p>
<h3>Fiftieth Anniversary of Postal Service: Commemorative Stamps Will Not Be Issued</h3>
<p>Because this year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the postal service, the postal authorities intended to follow the example of the 40th anniversary of the postal service and issue 50th-anniversary commemorative stamps. Due to the postal service's lack of sufficient funds, it has been decided to abandon the idea of issuing 50th-anniversary commemorative stamps.</p>
<h3>Yihe Vessel Sacrificed in the War of Resistance: Wilkinson Posthumously Awarded Major</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The British Jardine Matheson's Yihe vessel was a shallow-water wheel steamer operating on the Yichang-Chongqing line of the Sichuan River, with a gross tonnage of only 707 tons and a length of 170 feet. In 1941, it was requisitioned by the navy and converted into a patrol warship. At 4:00 PM on February 14th of that year, the captain, Wilkinson, sighted two teams of Japanese armed transport ships, a total of fifteen ships, escorted by one Japanese destroyer and one large cruiser, off the coast of Singapore. The Yihe vessel had previously engaged in a fierce battle with Japanese aircraft, and the ship's hull was slightly damaged. The captain, Wilkinson, did not care for his own safety and opened fire at the enemy transport ships at a distance of 8,000 yards, hitting one large enemy transport ship, which immediately caught fire and sank. The Yihe vessel was eventually sunk by the enemy cruiser, and only a dozen people on the entire ship were rescued. Captain Wilkinson died at the same time as the ship. The British government commended Captain Wilkinson's meritorious service and posthumously awarded him the rank of naval major on the 17th of this month, and awarded him the Victoria Cross (the highest military medal in the United Kingdom). After learning of this, the company in this city also expressed their remembrance of the captain's righteousness.</p>
<h3>Christmas Trees Then and Now: The Biggest Customers Were Foreigners Who Have Mostly Returned Home</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Before the war, the brightly decorated and beautiful Christmas trees were a very large consumption during this festival. In the small area of ​​Jingan Temple Road alone, it was estimated that there were more than 2,000 branches. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Allied compatriots lived a difficult life in concentration camps, and the demand for Christmas trees decreased. However, on this day last year, the bells of liberation rang, and Christmas brought comfort and hope to the citizens. "Peace has come to the land of fire, and people meet with goodwill." Citizens enjoyed this festival in a joyful atmosphere. British and American expatriates emerged from the concentration camps. The American Navy, who had just arrived in Shanghai, spent as much of their wartime savings as possible in the market of this "Eastern Paris." The business of Christmas trees was also prosperous, and large stores in the Jingan Temple Road area sold more than 1,000 trees.</p>
<p>Time flies, and in the blink of an eye, another year has passed. The festival is approaching, and those who operate in the floral business have seen the situation last year and have made great preparations in advance. They have spared no effort to collect Christmas trees from Fenghua, Ningbo, Huzhou, and other places and transport them to Shanghai for sale. Generally speaking, Christmas trees can be divided into eleven types: The best are yews, which come from Fenghua and Ningbo. After skillful makeup, the largest ones sell for 180,000 to 200,000, and ordinary ones also have to sell for 70,000 to 80,000. The second best are firs, which are also transported from Fenghua and other places. Good ones sell for 50,000 to 60,000, and ordinary ones sell for 20,000 to 30,000. The most common are local junipers, which can be bought for 10,000 yuan. Flowers that decorate the Christmas festival also appear in various endearing poses, with prices ranging from 20,000 to 70,000 or 80,000. The main customers are mostly foreign women.</p>
<p>Is the Christmas tree business booming today? Will the labor of these florists be in vain? This question will have an accurate answer only after the 25th of this month. However, those engaged in this industry have some unfortunate premonitions. First of all, the biggest customers of Christmas trees are foreigners, but now these wealthy British and American expatriates are mostly spending the holidays peacefully in their hometowns. They have experienced the greatest risks in their lives in Shanghai and may have less attachment to Shanghai. Most of the American Navy in China is already in Qingdao, and only a few remain in Shanghai, and they are not really wealthy. As for the Chinese, the people in the church are few after all, and in this year, the market is tight, and the economy is not prosperous. The bosses are planning how to deal with the year-end bonuses, and the employees are considering how to pay off debts. The interest in Christmas is much lower than in the past. At the same time, material resources are scarce, and saving is the top priority, so the Christmas tree business is likely not as good as last year. However, there are also some unknown factors, such as the White Russians who have recently acquired Soviet nationality, who are cheering and celebrating and perhaps are using this Christmas to improve their luck!</p>
<h3>Customs Tightens Anti-Smuggling Work: Three Lines of Defense for Ships Entering the Port</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The situation of tax evasion and smuggling in the city is serious. Although the customs is tightening anti-smuggling work, smuggled goods are still found in the market from time to time. It is reported that most of the smuggled goods in Shanghai are first thrown into the sea outside the Wusongkou by ships and then transported to Shanghai by small boats via Wusong.</p>
<p>Smuggling and Tax Evasion are Not Easy</p>
<p>For this reason, the reporter specifically visited the person in charge of the Jianghai Customs to inquire about the details. They said that this may have been the case in the past, but it is probably impossible today. Foreign goods loaded on ships coming to Shanghai must go through three checkpoints. (1) There is a large ship of the Jianghai Customs outside Wusongkou, patrolling day and night. (2) A customs office is set up at Wusongkou, with a Deputy Commissioner of Customs stationed to be responsible for the investigation, and another ship is assisting in the work. (3) There are often boats patrolling the Huangpu River to prevent smuggling, so it is not easy to smuggle past these three checkpoints. Moreover, the customs has long stipulated that all ships traveling within twelve nautical miles of the national coastline, when the customs patrol boat issues various signals instructing them to stop, listen to the investigation, and do not comply, a blank cannon will be fired as a warning. If they resist again, the ship can be fired upon with live ammunition. However, the intention is not to sink the ship, but only to destroy its masts, mechanical parts, etc., to make it unable to sail. Recently, the customs has received an order from the Executive Yuan that, in order to strengthen the investigation and crackdown, naval ships will be temporarily borrowed, and customs officers will be stationed on the ships to carry out the investigation.</p>
<h3>Special Express Service Established for Long-Distance Calls between Nanjing and Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has recently established a special express telephone service to facilitate long-distance telephone users, effective from 0:00 on the 25th. The measures are as follows: (1) Connection time is less than ten minutes. (2) The price is calculated at double the rate of urgent calls. (3) The call number service will be temporarily opened. (4) Each phone call is limited to two calls. (5) The open locations are temporarily set in Shanghai and Nanjing. (6) Users who make special express calls must specify it when registering. It is also learned that special express telephone services in other locations will be opened one after another as soon as the installation is completed.</p>
<h3>Armory Explosion Case: Interrogation Continued Yesterday</h3>
<p>Although yesterday was a regular holiday, the investigation into the explosion at the No. 1 depot of the Jiangwan Second Armory did not stop. Relevant personnel were still being interrogated. However, due to the holiday at the Garrison Headquarters, the interrogation location was temporarily moved to the Garrison Department in the Disui Road area, within the Hudong Inspection Office. Starting at 2 PM, relevant personnel were brought in for questioning, including Deng, the section chief of the Ordnance Department of the First Supply District, who is currently in custody. Deng is not only the chief of the armory's main section but also the guarantor of the depot chief Wang Renshan. Now that Wang has fled to avoid punishment, Deng must bear considerable responsibility. The presiding interrogators were the same as the previous day: Bao Qihuang, Chief Military Judge of the Ministry of National Defense's Military Law Department, Yan Zi, Deputy Director of the Hudong Inspection Office, and Sheng Wuquan, Clerk. Contrary to rumors, Vice Minister Qin Decun did not participate in the interrogation. According to information obtained by the Central News Agency reporter from relevant sources, Qin Shouyu was also interrogated yesterday. Qin was the acting depot chief of the No. 1 depot of the Second Armory. He was previously arrested and dealt with for stealing and selling military equipment. Recently, the Ministry of National Defense approved a sentence of ten years imprisonment, and he has already been sent to prison. After Qin Shouyu was dismissed, Wang Renshan succeeded him as depot chief. Not long after taking office, this explosion occurred. It is reasonable that Qin was brought from prison for interrogation in this case. The trial work for all cases will continue at the Garrison Department military court starting today.</p>
<h3>Rice Store Robbery on Shangqiu Road: Bank Obtains Clues, Leading to the Arrest of the Robbers; One Robber Flees to Nanjing After the Crime</h3>
<p>[Our Report] On the afternoon of the 17th, the Laodachang Rice Store at No. 370 Shangqiu Road, Hudong, was suddenly robbed. A brief account was published in yesterday's newspaper. Here is a more detailed account: At about 5 PM that afternoon, two robbers suddenly entered the store. One was wearing a khaki military uniform and carrying a handgun, while the other was wearing a dark-colored short shirt and trousers and carrying two grenades. They entered the store, prohibiting anyone from making a sound. The one in military uniform guarded the store employees, while the one in plain clothes searched the bedroom and robbed a total of 280,000 yuan in legal tender, a Zheyue Bank check for 124,000 yuan, and a gold ring each from employee Wang Chengji and the store owner's wife. They then fled through the front door. At 4:30 PM the next afternoon, the store owner, Shen Yuzhang, returned to Shanghai from his hometown and reported the case to the Tilanqiao Police Station. The branch director, Zhang Renyou, knowing that it would be more difficult to pursue the case after a day had passed, quietly instructed the second section chief, Ma Zhuyu, to conduct a secret investigation. On the 21st, plainclothes police officers Yuan Qitai and Sun Hongbin were dispatched to wait at the Zhejiang Xingye Bank. Around 11 AM, Zhu Wenda, an apprentice from the Taikang Tailor Shop, came to the bank at No. 19 to cash the check. He was immediately taken to the station and confessed that his elder sister, Zhu Liju, had given it to him to withdraw the money. Later, Zhu Liju was arrested and stated that Tang Jiquan, who lived in a wooden shack on Xi'an Road, had given her the check to pay off a debt and that she did not know the source of the check. Police chief Fan Yunxing and police officers Qi Shaonong and Lu Dianyao were dispatched to arrest the robber Tang Jiquan at his address, where they confiscated a Japanese-style handgun, 71 bullets, and two grenades. Another accomplice, a retired soldier (who owned all the weapons), had already gone to Nanjing to visit friends the day after the robbery. The police station is currently conducting a strict search.</p>
<h3>Undesirable Elements' Special Profession: Extorting Those Who Held Positions in the Puppet Regime; Victims Include Lawyer Zhang Tong and Others</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Lao Zha sub-bureau recently received a tip that a group of undesirable elements were extorting money from people in the Hankou Road and Zhejiang Road area every evening under false pretenses. After investigation by the bureau, three suspects were arrested a few days ago: Yang Yiming, 34 years old, from Zhenjiang; Yuan Genfa, 36 years old; and Feng A'wu, also known as Xiao Wuxi, 39 years old, all from Wuxi. During interrogation, they confessed to extorting 7,000 yuan from Ding Haofu on Fuzhou Road and a large sum of money from Zhang Tong, a lawyer during the "puppet organization" era, in front of the Laobanzhai restaurant on Hankou Road. Since he didn't have cash, they pawned his watch for 80,000 yuan and gave it to them. They met Xu, who was a Japanese translator in Wuxi during the war, on Nanjing Road, and extorted money from him, taking a coat worth 40,000 yuan as compensation. They extorted 300,000 yuan in legal tender from Chen Boying, a former railway employee in Central China, on Jinling Road. The bureau will transfer the case to the court for prosecution on a regular basis.</p>
<h3>Huang Yanpei Sells Calligraphy [Not for Poverty]</h3>
<p>Since the breakdown of the KMT-CPC peace talks, Huang Yanpei has been reading books behind closed doors, living in seclusion. Recently, due to economic difficulties, he has been selling his calligraphy to support himself and has written a poem to introduce himself. The poem reads: "Why does an old man sell calligraphy? Not ashamed to sell to alleviate poverty. Having promised to write inscriptions on all mountains, I might as well form new [calligraphic] connections in the sea of ink. [If I] take it by chance, I am truly ashamed; earning a living is also hard work. Of the eight methods [of calligraphy], the mind comes first, the brush must be upright; learning to be a person at the pool in old age." It is said that his prices are 50,000 yuan for a couplet, 40,000 yuan for a fan, and 40,000 yuan for a vertical scroll, with a 20% surcharge for ink. Delivery is one week, and submissions can be made at the China Vocational Education Society at No. 80 Yandang Road, among other places.</p>

<h3>From Nourishing Prescriptions to Traditional Chinese Medicine</h3>
<p>When talking about winter tonics, one must mention nourishing prescriptions (gaozi yao). Traditionally, Chinese medicine stores are busy in the summer and profitable in the winter, with the profit coming from the sale of these nourishing prescriptions. Because many nourishing prescriptions contain precious medicinal ingredients, such as ginseng and deer antlers, and when solidifying the prescription, donkey-hide gelatin and turtle plastron gelatin must be used, which are also considered treasures. This year, a dose of nourishing prescription may cost no less than 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. The interest rates of medicine stores are inherently high, so if they can receive a few more nourishing prescription orders, they can happily celebrate the New Year, right?</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese medicine, except for a few that use animals and minerals, mostly consists of plants, with the producing areas distributed throughout the country, with Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi provinces producing the most. Traditional Chinese medicine also has a characteristic, which is that the medicinal properties of what is produced in area A are different from those produced in area B. Therefore, Chinese medicine stores advertise "authentic medicinal materials," indicating that the producing area is correct. Medicinal materials from various places are purchased from the producing areas by raw medicine traders, and medicine stores then wholesale them from raw medicine traders. After medicinal materials are purchased, they must be processed. The signboard "Prepared according to ancient methods" comes from this. However, many small medicine stores often do not have time to prepare them according to ancient methods, often doing things "carelessly".</p>
<p>There are more than 400 Chinese medicine stores in the city.</p>
<p>The most time-honored is Jiang Yanze, with more than 200 years of history. Hu Qingyutang was established here after being separated from Hangzhou after the founding of the Republic, but its scale and business are unmatched by any other medicine store in Shanghai. No matter what kind of precious medicinal material or rare pill or powder there is, it will not be without it. As for Xu Chongdao's branches, they are all over Shanghai, which is another style. A medicine store employee must know thousands of herbal medicines, thousands of pills, powders, and elixirs. It is not possible for a layperson to cope with this, so they mostly come from apprenticeship backgrounds. In small medicine stores, an employee has to do everything, at most being divided into the pill and powder department and the prepared slice department. But in large medicine stores, each has its own specialty. Those who slice are called Knife Masters, those who pack medicine in small drawers are called Drawer Room, and those who manufacture pills and powders also have someone specifically in charge. In extremely large-scale Hu Qingyutang, there are five major rooms and six minor rooms: prepared slices room, pill and powder room, fine ingredient room, large ingredient room, and knife room belong to the major rooms; medicine picking room, ledger room, fine nourishing prescription room, fine goods room, and herbal medicine room, product room belong to the minor rooms. All employees are about 300.</p>
<p>Selling an Ounce, Buying a Pound</p>
<p>Opening a medicine store is a good business, the so-called "buying with large scales, selling with small scales." Their profits are very considerable. It is very common for medicine with a normal cost of 1,000 yuan to be sold for 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. There are several kinds of medicine that, when selling an ounce, can be used to buy a pound. What kind of benefit is this? However, there are also difficulties in selling so expensive. Many rare and precious medicines often have no inquiries after four or five years. At the same time, many medicines will go bad during the plum rain season every year, so they have to do so. This refers to large medicine stores. Small medicine stores do not prepare many valuable medicines. After the moldy medicines are picked out, they are sold again. Therefore, it is much cheaper to go to small medicine stores to fill prescriptions. Although the guild has now unified prices, small medicine stores are still more discounted.</p>
<p>Brewing Medicine for Customers</p>
<p>Brewing medicine for customers was invented by Xu Chongdao. In the past, many large medicine stores were arrogant, and they still refuse to brew medicine for customers. However, nourishing prescriptions have always been brewed by medicine stores, and even purple copper pots, charcoal stoves, and presses are carried to your residence to stew and simmer in person to show respect. The brewing method of nourishing prescriptions is different from ordinary medicines. The amount of medicine is large, and the medicinal properties must be distinguished and soaked. When brewing, which ingredients are brewed first, which ingredients are put in later, how much time is used with a strong fire, and how much time is used with a slow fire, all have requirements. Especially the last stage of "solidifying the prescription," how to use donkey-hide gelatin, and when to add rock sugar, cannot be done at will. A person who doesn't know how to brew medicine simply doesn't know how to turn this large pot of medicinal materials into a small ceramic jar, wasting many valuable medicines for nothing. Fortunately, nourishing prescriptions are a good sale in medicine stores, so they do not hesitate to move their dignity and teach people to boil them.</p>
<p>Beijing-Made Proprietary Medicines, Famous Throughout the Country</p>
<p>Many proprietary medicines in traditional Chinese medicine are very famous. Lei Yunsheng's Six-God Pill is sold to Japan and Nanyang, with huge annual sales. Others such as Hu Qingyutang's Plague-Expelling Pill and Tong Hanchun's Regeneration Pill are famous proprietary medicines. On the opening day of the former Beijing Hongrentang, 60 dan of donkey-hide gelatin were sold. There are also many tonics among the proprietary medicines, such as Hundred-Tonic Paste and Golden Deer Pill, which have tonic properties. Beijing-made proprietary medicines have always been famous throughout the country. Xia Tieying created the Beijing Medicine Bureau, specializing in the sale of Beijing-made proprietary medicines. Among them, tonics such as Nine-Heaven Great Tonic Paste and Ninety-Nine Rejuvenation Liquor sold well, but unfortunately they soon closed.</p>
<p>If the medicine is wrong, it concerns human life. In Shanghai, there have been several times when the wrong medicine was dispensed, or the medicines of two families were switched, causing minor illnesses or death. Afterward, the patient's family found evidence from the medicinal residue and sued the law. As a result, the medicine store secretly hired someone to come out and compensate the matter. This is the intangible loss of the medicine store, but if the court investigates and tests, the medicine store may not be fully responsible, but the reputation of the medicine store is affected. Therefore, what can be seen in the newspaper is only a very small number.</p>
<p>Many medicine stores, for the sake of business, invite doctors to set up clinics in the store. Several small medicine stores, with only enough space for knees, actually hang up the signboard of "Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctor ××× Clinic." In today's housing shortage, doctors of course get a ready-made place to set up a clinic, and medicine stores can also do more business. The so-called "boats help the water, water helps the boats" is also true. There are also many small medicine stores that contact doctors with sluggish business and implement a sending diagnosis method. Patients have been deceived by the sending diagnosis, of course, they will not go to another store to buy medicine.</p>
<p>Now, scientific medicine is very popular, but the business of Chinese medicine stores is still not greatly affected. But seeing people progressing rapidly, while Chinese medicine stores are still stuck in the old ways, it is inevitable that the prospect is an obstacle. Many raw medicinal materials are shipped overseas every year, refined and then imported back to China, which is a great omission. At the same time, many effective proprietary medicines in traditional Chinese medicine, the formulas are often kept secret and eventually lost, which is also a very regrettable thing. Those engaged in the business of Chinese medicine should pay attention.</p>

<h3>Tonics in Western Medicine</h3>
<p>When scientific medicine first entered, the Chinese people did not trust it very much. Even now, in big cities, many people still miss our "national essence" - traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese medicine. Among the tonics in Western medicine, cod liver oil was the first to be welcomed by the Chinese people, and the "Debacle" cod liver oil sold for a while. Later, the discovery of "Vitamin" made people feel even more novel. Many tonics, tonics, and pills have been adopted by the Chinese people one after another.</p>
<p>In Shanghai's Western medicine industry, the founding was the British-owned Great Britain Pharmacy, established in the sixth year of Guangxu. In the thirtieth year of Guangxu, Great Britain Pharmacy employee Sun Songquan raised funds to establish the Sino-Western Pharmacy on Quanzhou Road. This was the beginning of Chinese people operating the new medicine industry. At that time, the profits were very abundant, so the Chinese employees of various foreign pharmacies set up their own stores one after another, with the Sino-French, Sino-British, and Sino-English Five Continents and other pharmacies. At that time, although there were many pharmacies, the business was not affected, and there was a profit to be made every year.</p>
<p>Initially, the operation of Western medicine was purely for sales purposes. After the founding of the Republic of China, several larger companies tried to set up factories to manufacture on their own, such as the artificial Zilai blood of Wuzhou Pharmacy and the Ren Dan of Sino-French Pharmacy, both of which had their history and status in the past. As more operators gradually emerged, the scope of business also gradually shrank. Photographic materials were seized by photo shops exclusively, cosmetics were occupied by Kuang Sheng and other household industry companies, and dental equipment was handled by dental merchants. At the same time, competition among the same industry was extremely fierce, and the selling price of famous European Western medicines was even lower than the cost. At this point, the appearance of Western medicine, which was outwardly strong but inwardly weak, has gradually been exposed.</p>
<p>Manufacturing New Drugs, Profits Doubled</p>
<p>During the decline of the Western medicine industry, each pharmacy paid attention to manufacturing, because the profit from selling finished medicines was meager, and there was even a risk of losing money. It is better to manufacture new medicines, which may be doubled. So they imitated European and American finished medicines to make profits. There are also factories specializing in pharmaceuticals. For example, the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory originally made cosmetics, but after the September 18th Incident, it switched to making various injectable medicines. In the nineteenth year, the Yiyi Pharmaceutical Factory, operated by German businessmen, was also taken over by the Chinese. Other small pharmaceutical factories also sprung up like mushrooms after rain.</p>
<p>Manufacturing new medicines mostly imitates European and American formulas. At first, only simpler ones were selected, and gradually those with more complex properties. Finally, new medicines were created, and attention was paid to traditional Chinese medicine raw materials, which were refined. For example, Minsheng Pharmaceutical Factory's Ansoulu is a combination of traditional Chinese medicine ingredients such as Dazhi, Platycodon, Fritillaria, and Apricot Kernel. This situation seems to be a major advance in the new medicine industry. In recent years, the Chinese people's belief in Western medicine has gradually increased, and more and more people are taking Western medicine. The new medicine industry could have flourished. No such scientific backwardness, although many domestic Western medicines have been produced, many finished products are still no match for imported goods, and special drugs cannot be relied on for import. The products of Bayer, Schering, and Merck in Germany, and Lily, Purdue, and Pfizer in the United States, and Beauvais in the United Kingdom still occupy a very large market share in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Many Kinds of Tonics</p>
<p>There are many kinds of tonics in Western medicine, too many to enumerate. The popular tonics in the early years, which enhanced blood circulation and promoted the function of metabolism, were mostly iron preparations. The domestic artificial Zilai blood belongs to this category. Later, animal organs were used to replenish the human body, such as hormones made from endocrine and liver paste made from beef liver. Organ therapy has already been discussed in Chinese medical books, but it is not scientific. Westerners have improved it with scientific methods, and it has become the most effective tonic. With the progress of chemotherapy, more tonics have been made, such as various vitamins, which are also widely popular.</p>
<p>A more popular tonic is cod liver oil. Cod liver oil is refined from the liver of cod, and the northern part of Norway has the highest output. The folk customs of Northern Europe have been used as food for a long time, and it is also used for the treatment of joint inflammation. In the eighteenth century, it was first known that cod liver oil could treat rickets and pulmonary tuberculosis. In 1926, it was discovered that cod liver oil contains vitamin D, so it can cure pulmonary tuberculosis. Therefore, the production, manufacture, and consumption of cod liver oil is becoming more and more widespread, and it has formed an indissoluble bond with pulmonary tuberculosis. Recently, it has been discovered that cod liver oil has the effect of inhibiting the development of bacteria. Not only tuberculosis bacteria, but also pyogenic bacteria and anaerobic bacteria are affected by it.</p>
<p>Cod liver oil is a fluid fat with a light yellow color. Although the tonic power is great, it has an unusual fishy odor, and many people cannot swallow it. Mothers force children to take it, and children almost cry when they smell its fishy odor. Therefore, some people try to reconcile it with other things to reduce the fishy odor and make it taste better. Malt Essence Cod Liver Oil and Milky White Cod Liver Oil are made in this way. Finally, the cod liver oil is refined into an essence or made into pills, which is more convenient.</p>
<p>Most of the cod liver oil sold in Chinese pharmacies is imported from abroad in its original barrels, and then packaged and prepared. Among the refined products, such as the Trustworthiness and Health's Haolisheng and New Asia's Hailiming, their ingredients and effects are no less than those of imported products.</p>
<p>Vitamin has become a household name today, and everyone knows that it is the main nutrient. But when it comes to categories, ingredients, and the relationship to the human body, many people don't know. The inventor of vitamin was Casmir Funk of Cambridge, England, who separated a substance that prevents beriberi from rice husks and believed that it was a type of armine. Because it is related to the human body, it is named vitamin.</p>
<p>Vitamins are generally divided into five types: A, B, C, D, and E. In fact, from the perspective of chemical composition and effects on the human body, they are not so simple. But vitamin is not a special thing, it is found in general food, and if you pay attention to diet at ordinary times, the nutrition is very sufficient, and vitamin deficiency will not occur. However, the vitamins in food are often lost due to cooking or destroyed due to corruption, so there are symptoms of vitamin deficiency. The medical community is working to extract vitamins for treatment. However, according to people in the medical community, taking too many vitamins also has drawbacks, which must be known.</p>
<p>During the War</p>
<p>During the war, countries were short of food, and soldiers on the front lines suffered from insufficient nutrition. Vitamins were the main weapon to combat diseases caused by malnutrition, so they were manufactured one after another. The United States produced the most. The vitamins manufactured in 1944 were worth 47 million US dollars. After the war, the trade volume of American vitamins was even greater.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the source of Western medicines was blocked, and Shanghai medicine merchants competed to hoard them. Several special medicines became scarce and profitable. Pharmaceutical factories also made a lot of money due to market demand. After the victory, American medicines, led by DDT, were transported in large quantities. Like vitamin pills, one person was five steps away, and a store was ten steps away, shouting and selling along the street, so that the sales of domestic products were sluggish. Since the news of purchasing surplus materials from the US military on Pacific islands came out, the pharmacists have been uneasy. Looking forward to the future of the Western medicine industry, it can be said that it is in a severe crisis. Foreign goods are flooding in, and expenses are huge. Now most of them are in a semi-operational state. To save this serious situation, everyone must work hard.</p>

<h3>Nurse's Side Job: Giving Injections in Spare Time</h3>
<p>"Home injections, intravenous and intramuscular injections, Miss Electric ××× No. ×."</p>
<p>In the classified ads of the local newspaper, you can often find this type of advertisement. The short two or three lines embellish the space and can be considered a unique business in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Winter is a time for tonics, and injections are popular because of their effectiveness. But injecting medicines is a specialized skill that ordinary people cannot do themselves. They must consult nurses. Therefore, this specialized profession of injecting tonics has emerged. They are nurses or midwives with medical knowledge, and most of them still work in hospitals. In today's high cost of living, hospital treatment may not be enough to maintain life, so they have to find other ways to earn extra income, so they use their spare time to give injections.</p>
<p>Don't underestimate this simple and easy job. When it's busy, the income is considerable in a winter. Now, subcutaneous and intramuscular injections cost 3,000 to 4,000 yuan per time. Injections of tonics require dozens of injections, so isn't there an income of hundreds of thousands of yuan? However, running around in wind and snow is also quite hard. At the same time, transportation is difficult in urban areas now, and it takes a lot of time. For distant places, a considerable fare must also be paid.</p>
<h3>Ginseng, Deer Velvet, and Bird's Nest</h3>
<p>Ginseng</p>
<p>Ginseng is known as the king of tonics. It is called ginseng because its shape resembles a human. The best ginseng is produced in Jilin and the Ussuri River region. There is a saying in Northeast China: "The three treasures of the three eastern provinces are ginseng, deer velvet, and Ula grass." Except for Ula grass, all are tonics, and ginseng is the most precious.</p>
<p>Ginseng grows deep in the forests of the old mountains, but it must not be shaded by trees. It must have sunlight to grow. Its growth process can be divided into six stages. From one to five years, it grows a palmate leaf, commonly known as "bazhangzi." From five to ten years, it grows leaves, each called "erlai shi." Twenty years produce three leaves, called "santaizi." Thirty years produce four leaves, called "sipinyie." From thirty to forty to fifty years, and from fifty to sixty years, it grows six leaves in full, which means it has grown long. Ginseng that is sixty years old is already very valuable. If the roots, head, body, and limbs are complete, it can be sold for a good price. The newly grown leaves are tender green. At one hundred years, they gradually turn yellow. Ginseng that is five hundred years old has tender yellow leaves. Ginseng that is a thousand years old turns old yellow and has bright red flowers, which is extremely rare.</p>
<p>Ginseng is not easy to harvest. Ginseng collectors usually enter the mountains in teams between August and September, about twenty people in a group, spaced hundreds of steps apart, responding to each other, and carrying weapons to prevent bandits and wild animals. Ginseng collectors must find ginseng seedlings among thousands of flowers, so they must have special experience to do this. If they find a ginseng seedling, they shout "bangchui," tie it with a red thread, spread oilcloth, and dig it while lying down. When digging, use an ox horn shovel or jujube wood shovel, because touching the roots with metal will disperse the essence. Dig out the soil three feet away from the roots. As you dig closer, when you see golden yellow soil, gently loosen the soil with your hands. Then, take the ginseng with one hand and lift the seedling with the other, and take it out of the soil at the same time. If it cannot be completed in one day, stay and guard it until the whole ginseng is taken out. Display sacrificial offerings and kowtow to thank the mountain god. If the ginseng obtained is a large ginseng with six leaves, a whole sheep must be used as a sacrifice.</p>
<p>Ginseng is a tonic and occupies an important position in the herbal pharmacopoeia. But it is very snobbish and only associates with the rich and powerful. When the rich and powerful get sick, it is indispensable. All kinds of deficiencies and damages can be treated with it. It is warming but not drying, and nourishing but not heating. These are all slogans that make it popular. We see the ginseng shop of Duiheng Wangyu on Xian Gua Street in the city before the war, and its prestige made the poor flinch.</p>
<p>Deer Velvet</p>
<p>Deer are beautiful, covered in radiant brownish-yellow velvet, interspersed with circles of pure white spots. The pair of slender antlers on their heads are like the flowers inserted in the gauze hats of top scholars in old dramas. No wonder they are beside themselves with joy when they see their reflection drinking by the pool. Many people also believe that deer have an ethereal quality. Their graceful appearance is indeed devoid of any worldly air. Precisely because of their fairy-like qualities, they are often used as decorations for gardens. In the Qing Dynasty, thousands of deer were raised in the Rehe Imperial Palace. Watching them gallop under the rustling pines evokes thoughts of transcending the mundane.</p>
<p>Only male deer have antlers; female deer do not. The antlers of young deer are like sprouts at first, with skin covering them. The swollen part of the skin looks like a birthmark. This is the famous medicinal material deer velvet. Deer velvet grows on the head, bathing in the sunlight, so it has a red color. It is extremely hot in nature and functions to replenish yang, having the effect of causing withered trees to sprout. Deer velvet produced in the Northeast is called Guandong deer, which is even more precious. In the past, it was a medium for relationships among princes and ministers, and a high-end gift in officialdom.</p>
<p>We consider deer velvet to be a precious tonic, which is considered strange by most Europeans, but it aroused their curiosity. Professor Pavlenko, a specialist in endocrine studies, studied the chemistry, biology, and pharmacology of deer velvet for a long time. He collected many deer heads for experiments and found that the Chinese were not wrong in their use of medicine. Deer velvet is very rich in male gonadal hormones, which are indeed excellent tonics for the human body. But when we take dried deer velvet powder, the nourishing ingredients have already been lost. So he made it into a liquid for oral administration or subcutaneous injection, which is more effective, especially for sexual weakness. In Chinese medicine stores, deer have many uses. In addition to the precious deer velvet, the entire body can be used as medicine. Therefore, large pharmacies often raise their own deer. Hu Qingyutang in Hangzhou has a deer enclosure for people to browse. Several pharmacies in Shanghai occasionally get a deer and put it in the courtyard as a live signboard. When killing a deer, you cannot be casual. First, choose an auspicious time, feed the deer good food, and then light famous incense and giant candles. The owner, manager, deer feeder, and slaughterer bow to the deer to show a sense of reluctance, which shows their prudence.</p>
<p>Bird's Nest</p>
<p>Bird's nest is produced in the Nanyang region. It is the nest built by swiftlets. The swiftlets are as big as birds and build their nests on cliffs, shaped like sponges and arranged in no particular order. The nest is made by sticking seaweed together. When building the nest, the seaweed is first swallowed into the stomach, fermented by the gastric juices, and then spit out, becoming gelatinous. Another saying is that it is the viscous liquid secreted by the swallow's mouth. When swiftlets eat fish, saliva flows between the sea caves, which become food when molting in winter. Over time, they solidify into nests.</p>
<p>Every time the bird's nest harvesting season arrives, the natives take tools, prepare food, and go in groups. Harvesting is very difficult. They often hang ropes on the coast, between dangerous cliffs, hundreds of feet long. They have to climb the cliffs to get them. The old and weak fall to their deaths. Those who undertake this work are all local natives, who climb up and down with great agility. When they reach a high place, their hands hang on the concave parts of the cliff, looking as small as flies from a distance. The nests are attached to the coast and come off easily when picked, falling onto black excrement, so they are mostly complete. Companions see this, pick up the nests, wipe off the bird droppings, and take them out of the cave.</p>
<p>Bird's nests produced in E'luo are of the highest quality. The signboards of Nanyang goods stores often prominently display the four characters "Siamese Imperial Bird's Nest" to boast of their quality. Those who operate bird's nest in Siam are all overseas Chinese. Many overseas Chinese have become wealthy from this business. The method of operation is to first lend money to the natives, and then have the natives deliver the bird's nests as they are harvested.</p>
<p>Bird's nests with a pure white color are considered to be of the highest quality, which is what is called imperial bird's nest. Those with feathers mixed in, black and with blood stains, are called Mao Yan. They are composed of fine, grayish-white strips, which become soft and large when soaked in water. They are rich in collagen, so they are highly nourishing. Medical books say that they can nourish yin, reduce fire, resolve phlegm, stop coughing, clear the lungs, nourish the body, and prolong life, so they are regarded as precious tonics. Wealthy families use bird's nest as tonics. High-end banquets also use bird's nest as the main dish. There was a time when shark fin was banned, and bird's nest banquets became popular for a while.</p>
<p>White Fungus</p>
<p>Sichuan, known as the land of abundance, has many special products that are highly valued, especially white fungus, which is considered the most nourishing. White fungus is produced in western and northern Sichuan, with many good quality products from Wanyuan, Tongjiang, Guangyuan, and Zuning counties. Guizhou also produces it, but it is not as good as that produced in Sichuan.</p>
<p>White fungus is a variation of black fungus. Those in Sichuan who operate black fungus purchase "qingkang" trees every early summer, saw them into sections of three or four feet, called "tongzi," and place them in a shady, humid place. Soon, black fungus grows, which is shoveled and dried for sale. Sometimes the wood suddenly changes and produces white fungus. The price can be ten times that of black fungus, but once it grows, it will not grow again, and the wood becomes waste, as the wood's energy is exhausted in one go. The cost of the wood is very high, so those who operate this business consider it unfortunate if white fungus is produced. Now, people in Sichuan already know how to select special trees for the sole purpose of producing white fungus. In spring and autumn, when white fungus production is at its peak, it is harvested every three to five days. After taking it home, remove the bad ones, cut off the roots, wash it in clear mountain springs, select it again, and then string it into bunches with bamboo skewers or hemp thread and place it on the stove to bake. The fire must be strong but smokeless. Bake for four or five hours, being careful not to scorch it, otherwise it will be inferior. Fifty taels of large, fresh white fungus only yields one tael after drying, so it is conceivable how rare it is.</p>
<p>White fungus can treat blood deficiency, heart and kidney deficiency, and physical weakness. It is said to have a significant effect on difficult-to-treat lung diseases. However, white fungus is moistening, so it may not be suitable for obese people with damp phlegm. According to its name, white is the best color. When choosing, select those that are round and large like walnuts and clear white in texture. People in Sichuan call it "paozi yiner." Forgers often put broken white fungus in containers, add glutinous rice soup, and gradually stir it until it solidifies. It is also round and large, like "paozi," but the substance is slightly heavier, and experts can tell at a glance that it is fake.</p>

<h3>Suppressing Prices and Eliminating Hoarding: The Social Affairs Bureau Decides to Take Decisive Measures. Reserves of Essential Supplies are Extremely Sufficient. Citizens Can Report Price Manipulation.</h3>
<p>Recently, the prices in this city have risen sharply in succession due to the stimulation of soaring gold prices, which has greatly affected people's livelihoods. As the Social Affairs Bureau of the city is responsible for this, it has decided to strictly suppress it. According to the person in charge of the bureau: The prices in this city have been rising several times a day recently, and the bureau has been paying close attention to it. Now, citizens can be informed that the reserves of essential supplies such as rice, cooking oil, and sugar in this city are extremely sufficient, and the sources are smooth. There is no risk of interruption. In order to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, the bureau has now decided to take decisive measures. Those who manipulate prices and hoard goods will be severely punished without leniency. Starting today, the bureau will sell large quantities of rice in the market in order to suppress the rising trend, and has sent letters to Hezhong Sugar and other companies and the China Vegetable Oil Factory, requesting them to sell sugar and oil without restriction starting today. Therefore, the prices of rice, bran, and oil will definitely drop in the near future. As for the fuel problem, the source of coal is already very smooth. Within one or two days, 6,500 tons of Hongji coal dust will arrive in Shanghai. Recently, 10,000 tons of white coal from the Fushun Coal Mine will also come to Shanghai. Therefore, there is no shortage of coal for people's livelihoods, and its price will be self-regulating. As for kerosene, under the unscrupulous manipulation of unscrupulous merchants, the price has soared. The bureau has now decided to do its best to suppress it, and has negotiated with companies such as Asia and Texaco, deciding that these companies will sell it without restriction. In short, the bureau has a great determination to suppress prices, and also has absolute certainty. Therefore, it is hoped that citizens will not be confused by rumors and avoid being taken advantage of by unscrupulous merchants. In addition, citizens can directly report situations such as price manipulation and hoarding of goods by unscrupulous merchants to the Price Management Section of the Economic Administration Department of the bureau. If the prices of supplies such as oil, rice, cotton cloth, woolen yarn, and coal balls exceed the price limits set by the bureau, they can also be reported. Once discovered, they will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>The Future of Paper Mills is Precarious. Only Six of the Fifteen State-Run Paper Mills are Operating. The Twenty-Three Private Paper Mills are All Small in Scale.</h3>
<p>Due to the impact of foreign paper dumping, the future of the paper industry in this city is in jeopardy. At present, only state-run paper mills can barely maintain operations. These paper mills are all former Japanese factories that have been reorganized. There are fifteen in total. Among them, in addition to Donghua Paper Products Printing, Shanghai Paper Products, Shanghai Processing, and Gaolin Cardboard, which are four cardboard or carton factories, the three companies of Jing Shang Toyo and Shanghai Paper Industry are all small in scale. The more important ones are Tianzhang and Jiangnan. However, the newspapers they produce are not of high quality. All the products are gray newspaper. Currently, only six of the fifteen state-run paper mills are operating. As for private paper mills, there are only twenty-three at present. Their products are mostly cardboard boxes. The factories that were operating last month are listed below: A. State-run Paper: (1) Tianzhang Original Paper Eastern Factory (producing banknote paper). (2) Tianzhang Western Factory (producing newspaper). (3) Jiangnan First Factory (producing banknote paper). (4) Jiangnan Second Factory (producing banknote paper). (5) Dazhonghua (producing newspaper). (6) Jing Shang (producing newspaper). B. Private Paper: (1) Datong, (2) Dalu, (3) Zhonghe, (4) Zhonghua, (5) Zhongguo, (6) Tianyi, (7) Minxing, (8) Shui'an, (9) Guangjin, (10) Liyong, (11) Xin'an, (12) Huazhang, (13) Hualun, (14) Huasheng, (15) Huali, (16) Haifeng, (17) Hailong, (18) Shenzhou, (19) Jinlun, (20) Qinye, (21) Rongchang.

<h3>The Authorities Will Send Personnel to Inspect the North and South Rice Markets Today.</h3>
<p>Recently, rice prices have risen sharply again, and the common people are feeling threatened. Mayor Wu has always attached great importance to the stability of rice prices. At this time of economic distress, he cannot allow rice prices to rise sharply. Therefore, he stated that the prices of all rice must be in accordance with the reviewed prices, and that Shanghai has sufficient reserves and smooth sources from various places. There is absolutely no problem with rice, and there is no reason to raise prices. He has already ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to closely monitor rice market transactions. It is reported that the relevant authorities have decided to send personnel to inspect the north and south markets today. If it is found that there is price gouging, hoarding of goods, or similar circumstances, they will be banned and severely punished.</p>
<p>Another news item: The reporter made a special visit to the person in charge of grain administration in this city yesterday. He was told: The rising trend of food prices is indeed due to the stimulation of the gold-dollar exchange rate, but most of it is actually caused by manipulation by unscrupulous merchants. The Shanghai General Warehouse of the Ministry of Food yesterday sent personnel to Wuxi to extract 50,000 dan of white rice that had been purchased and stored in Wuxi for storage in Shanghai, and will distribute it when necessary. In addition, 30,000 tons of foreign rice will be imported within a few days, totaling more than 370,000 dan, which is enough for the city's needs in August. Some unscrupulous merchants and hoarders are currently hoarding and not selling, but they will definitely be hit in the short term, because high interest rates are the fatal weakness of hoarding. He is absolutely optimistic about the future of the rice market and expects prices to fall within a few days.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Trade Declines: Imports and Exports in November are Both Lower Than in October.</h3>
<p>According to Hong Kong government import and export statistics, Hong Kong's total trade in November this year decreased compared to October.

<h3>The Shipping Industry Establishes a Specialized Committee. Disaster Relief Work Begins on New Year's Day.</h3>
<p>In order to promote its work and resolve various difficulties in the shipping industry, the Shipping Industry Association has decided to establish the following specialized committees through the decision of the Board of Directors and Supervisors: (1) Industry Cooperation Committee, (2) Compensation Committee, (3) Ship Purchasing Committee, (4) Ship Self-Insurance Preparation Committee, (5) Disaster Relief Committee, (6) Rate Committee, (7) Shipping Uniform Document Committee, (8) Accounting Uniformity Committee, (9) Public Relations Committee. The Disaster Relief Committee was formally established last Saturday. The committee members are Li Bangban Zhenxian from the Executive Yuan, Xue Baokang, Hu Shi, Deputy Manager of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and Yu Shunwei, from the Shipping Association, Yu Haoyun, Li Zhiyi, Lu Yuzhi, Li Yunliang, and others. Hu Shiyuan was publicly elected as the director of the committee. After the meeting, it was decided to divide state-run and private ships into six groups to rescue military supplies, public goods, and refugees, and other special transportation matters. It is now scheduled to officially start disaster relief work on New Year's Day next year. The remaining eight committees will be established successively on New Year's Day next year.</p>
<h3>Lack of Raw Materials and Exchange Losses: Flower and Lace Exports Plummet. The Government is Urgently Expected to Provide Assistance.</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] The flower and embroidery industry has always been one of China's important handicrafts. Before the war, no fewer than 10 million people in the coastal provinces depended on it for a living. In terms of export value, it even exceeded the export value of China's special product silk and jumped to the fifth place in total export value, making it an important export material for China to earn huge amounts of foreign exchange. Unfortunately, after the victory, due to the high cost of raw materials and labor, and traffic congestion, production was low and exports were even worse. According to industry insiders, the reasons are: (1) The main raw materials are hemp cloth and yarn. Linen cloth has always been supplied by the United Kingdom. However, the United Kingdom will not be able to resume the supply of new hemp cloth until the year after next, and the price has already risen four times compared to before the war. The stocks in Shanghai have also risen eight times compared to pre-war prices. As for the price of yarn, if valued in US dollars, it has also risen seventeen times compared to before the war. Therefore, the prices of both Chinese and foreign raw materials are expensive. (2) Labor costs vary slightly depending on the region. The flower and embroidery industry has always been based in Shantou and Yantai. Now, due to the unstable situation in Yantai, production is difficult. However, labor costs in Shantou are about half the cost in Shanghai. Therefore, Shantou is still maintaining a small amount of production. It is estimated that the monthly production value is about 300 million yuan in legal tender. Labor costs there, if valued in US dollars, have also risen by onefold compared to before the war. However, Shantou has a severe shortage of raw materials, and normal production is not possible. As for Shanghai, labor costs are too expensive and raw materials are also expensive, so production has completely stopped. (3) Traffic congestion. Taking the traffic between the main producing area Shantou and Shanghai as an example, there are very few ships traveling each month, which greatly affects the transportation and sales of products. (4) Losses in exchange. For domestic exchange, only 92 yuan is received in Shantou for every 100 yuan remitted from Shanghai. In terms of foreign exchange, the current official exchange rate of the US dollar is more than double that of the black market for US dollars. The flower and embroidery industry pays for raw materials and labor, which have inflated more than 10,000 times. The foreign exchange earned from the export of finished products must still be sold to the government at the official US dollar exchange rate, which has inflated only 1,000 times. The loss in this is self-evident. For this reason, the export sales of the industry's current products have almost come to a standstill. Before the war, the industry association had a total of more than 150 members, which has now decreased to 113. Therefore, it is hoped that the government and relevant authorities can assist. The people in the industry have put forward two points: (1) It is hoped that the import tax on the industry's raw materials, such as flax cloth and money, can be exempted to reduce the cost of raw materials. (2) After the foreign exchange earned from exports is sold to the government at the official price, it is hoped that the government can subsidize the black market difference to maintain the industry's production costs.</p>
<h3>Commercial Recession: 20 Businesses Closed Last Week</h3>
<p>Most are Daily Necessities and Food Stores</p>
<p>The commercial situation in this city did not improve last week. A total of 20 shops and factories closed, for two reasons: (1) Affected by the recession, (2) Oppressed by high-interest loans. The shops that closed include 7 food stores, 10 daily necessities stores, and 3 stores with unclear categories. By date, 1 store closed on the 16th, 5 stores on the 17th, 3 stores on the 18th, 4 stores on the 19th, 4 stores on the 20th, 1 store on the 21st, and 2 stores on the 22nd.</p>
<h3>5,000 Tons of US Wheat Allocated to Four Major Factories</h3>
<p>The long-awaited 25,000 tons of US wheat, the first batch of 8,600 tons of which arrived here from New Orleans on the US ship "Huan Si" last week, is being unloaded into warehouses. This wheat is a UN relief supply, of which 5,000 tons have been borrowed in advance with the consent of the Executive Yuan of the Ministry of Food to supply the city's four major flour mills with flour-making raw materials to meet the city's needs and stabilize prices. The wheat will be allocated to each factory within days. It is heard that the remaining 106,000 tons of US wheat are also on their way to Shanghai, loaded by two US ships, and are expected to arrive this year.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Lifts Ban on Exports of Coconut Oil, Rubber, Poplin, etc.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 22nd] The Hong Kong government today officially lifted the ban on exports of coconut oil, rubber, poplin, tobacco, etc.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Corporation Has Ample Stocks: Sugar Sales are Brisk and Prices are High</h3>
<p>The end of the year has always been the peak season for sugar sales. Not only have actual sales in this city increased, but also other ports have come to purchase, especially raw sugar. The compensation market for medium sugar on Saturday last week once opened at 150,000 yuan (limit price 130,000 yuan), and the opening price for raw sugar was 141,000 yuan (limit price 110,000 yuan). The Taiwan Sugar Corporation held the 28th allocation meeting on Thursday last week, totaling 55,000 bags, of which 11,000 bags were industrial. The goods can be shipped on schedule this Wednesday. After the goods are shipped, the 29th allocation will continue the next day. It is expected that the original limit price can be maintained at that time. According to the company, the sugar transported from Taiwan to Shanghai by Hezhong Shipping in recent months has been very large. A total of more than 60,000 containers, with a total of more than 600,000 bags (each bag containing 180 catties), are stored around the Huangpu River. It is also learned that from next year, the company and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company have agreed that at least 10,000 tons of sugar will be shipped from Taiwan to Shanghai every month.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on US Cotton Imports: The Textile Industry Will Be Affected</h3>
<p>A magnate in the hunger cotton textile industry told reporters: The only industry in China that can occupy a place in the world is the cotton textile industry. Among the enemy and puppet industries taken over after this victory, the achievements of the textile industry are the best. Since the Anti-Japanese War in 1939, factories in various industries have been affected and production has decreased day by day. However, the textile industry, which is indispensable for people's clothing, has leapt to become a leading industry. Unfortunately, its operating rights are still controlled by the enemy. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, the losses during the war are large, and people's clothing is lacking and urgently needs to be replenished. Therefore, the need for yarn and cloth is even more pressing. During the war, the government exercised control, and business was restricted. After the victory, the government abolished it, and the textile industry was able to develop freely. In addition, US cotton was low and product prices rose, creating a golden age for the textile industry. But this situation cannot last long. US cotton imports have been restricted, so how can prices remain low in the future? China was originally established on agriculture, but now it relies on foreigners for cotton. The reason is nothing more than that the cost of domestic cotton is higher, and its quality is not as good as US cotton. Therefore, those who grow cotton mostly switch to other crops, so cotton production cannot be increased. However, if US cotton imports decrease day by day, and domestic cotton production is low, then the price of domestic cotton will inevitably be high, and the cost of yarn and cloth will increase, and profits will be reduced. The future of the yarn and weaving industry cannot be guaranteed to always maintain this golden age.</p>
<h3>Discussion by Responsible Person of the China Farmers' Bank Tea Loan Regarding Tea Mortgage Concerns: This Year's Tea Market Decline Makes Tea Loan Repayment Difficult</h3>
<p>A reporter spoke with a certain manager of the China Farmers' Bank in charge of tea loans, inquiring about the bank's tea mortgage support for the tea industry and future prospects. The manager stated: The tea loan was issued in response to government orders. This year's tea situation will make it difficult to repay the tea loan. If this case is not resolved quickly within the year, not only will tea merchants be unable to operate due to all their funds being frozen, but next year's tea industry will also wither. Therefore, the government will inevitably take appropriate measures to resolve the tea loan arrears and develop planned projects for future purchases to offset debts, handled by the China Farmers' Bank or the Central Trust Bureau. Currently, the tea mortgage prices are 200,000 yuan per dan for Pingshui tea, 350,000 yuan per dan for Qimen tea, and 280,000 yuan per dan for Tunxi tea, with other prices yet to be determined. The above are all average prices. When tea merchants mortgage, they can allocate loans based on tea quality. This measure greatly facilitates tea merchants. Applications for mortgages exceed 3 billion yuan. There are also self-made tea mortgages totaling 3 billion yuan, with 180,000 yuan per dan for Pingshui tea, 297,500 yuan per dan for Qimen tea, and 238,000 yuan per dan for Tunxi tea. The loans already issued amount to 1.2 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>European and American Economic Policies: Promoting Production and Earning Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Mr. Qian Tianhe Discusses Impressions from His Inspection of Europe and America</p>
<p>Commodity prices in our country are rising and production is shrinking. The government has taken various measures to stabilize the currency and suppress commodity prices, such as recently revising import and export plans and establishing a Rolling Input Management Committee to increase foreign exchange reserves and stabilize commodity prices, and establishing a Production Loan Review Committee to promote production. Post-war recovery is not unique to our country, as all overseas countries are doing the same. According to Mr. Qian Tianhe, Vice Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, who was dispatched abroad in May of this year to inspect post-war agricultural production and recovery in Europe and America and returned to Shanghai last Wednesday (18th): Post-war recovery countries all prioritize accelerating production and encouraging exports. The United States has strong productivity and suffered less wartime losses than other countries. However, Britain's current policy is to extremely emphasize three items: increased production, sales benefits, and comprehensive planning. The fundamental requirements are to encourage production and its sales scope to prevent products from becoming stagnant, and to increase benefits to strengthen production and sales interest. For example, agricultural product prices are set low to reduce the burden on consumption. Farmers receive subsidies in addition to sales prices. These subsidies come from taxing daily necessities at 5% or 20%, or even luxury goods at 100%, to compensate for it. This prevents agricultural product prices from soaring and threatening people's lives. This is a type of emerging "egalitarian" method. Also, saving clothing and food and exporting surplus materials to foreign countries earns foreign exchange. Currently, British citizens receive 50 to 60 clothing coupons per year from the government. A pair of socks requires one coupon, a tie requires two coupons, and a suit requires 26 coupons. This means that the entire year's income is only enough to exchange for two suits. I, myself, when staying in England, frequently saw gentlemen on the streets wearing clothing from several years ago. The English value repairs and do not feel ashamed. Food is also restricted. Previously, eggs, flour, pork, and ham were all supplied by Denmark. Currently, the British government stipulates one egg per month, reduces bread and replaces it with vegetables. Britain is a fish-producing country and relies mainly on fish, abandoning ham and pork, and even resorting to rabbit meat. Normally, meals cost five shillings, limited to one soup, one dish, and one dessert. At this time of year, the government broadcasts to citizens via radio when purchasing bridges for import, recognizing this as the sound of Christmas approaching. Regarding the currency system, silver subsidiary coins have recently been replaced with nickel coins, and the silver is melted down to repay war debts. Such examples are numerous. Their daily life is half as expensive as in the United States. France, Denmark, etc., are one-third cheaper than England. France's recovery is slower due to political unrest. However, there has been significant progress in construction. Denmark has always been an agricultural country and suffered relatively little during the war. Currently, agricultural development and increased production are truly astonishing, but they are worried about the reduction in exports to England compared to before. In summary, European countries consider production a current priority, and exporting to earn foreign exchange is not to be delayed. Even when seeking raw material imports from other countries is unavoidable, they are changing to countries that are more friendly and closer to them, such as England importing wheat, meat, and eggs, which were previously mainly imported from Denmark, but are now imported from Canada.</p>

<h3>Preferential Treatment for Normal School Students Enlisting in the Military: Shortening Service Period and Issuing Certificates in Advance: Ministry of Education Has Formulated Four Measures and Issued a Circular for Compliance</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The Ministry of Education previously formulated preferential measures for normal school graduates enlisting in the military, stipulating that if the combined total of their service period and military service period reaches two and a half years, it will be considered as fulfilling the service period, and they can pursue further education. The Ministry of Education has recently issued a circular to the education departments of various provinces and cities: For normal school graduates enlisting in the military who have completed two and a half years of service, graduation certificates will be issued half a year in advance to facilitate further education.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The Ministry of Education has formulated four measures for preferential treatment of normal school students returning to school after military service and has issued a circular for compliance. The details are as follows: (1) The service period for graduates of normal schools and simplified normal schools is uniformly set at three years. After enlisting in the military, two and a half years can be considered as fulfilling the service period, and the period of military service can be deducted from the service period. However, students who have already received academic preferential treatment under item 2 will still have a service period of three years, which cannot be reduced. (2) Normal school and simplified normal school students who enlist in the military, when returning to school, if their grades are excellent, can be handled in accordance with the Measures for Academic Preferential Treatment of Middle School Students Enlisting in the Military. Those in the first semester of the third year of normal school or the first semester of the fourth year of simplified normal school are allowed to graduate, but the graduation certificate should be issued after the service period is fulfilled, as stipulated. (3) Normal school and simplified normal school students who have completed their service according to item 1 upon discharge from the military can be admitted to normal colleges or normal schools without examination. (4) Those enlisting in the military with teacher qualifications should be handled in accordance with the regulations for youth enlisting in the military with vocational qualifications.</p>

<h3>Municipal Elementary School Teacher Salary Issues: Mayor Wu Awaits a Clear Order from the Central Government to Decide: Private School Association Sends a Letter of Support and Offers Assistance</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The ninth representative assembly of the Municipal Elementary School Teachers' Association was held yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at the Zhabei Elementary School. More than 200 representatives from municipal elementary schools in various districts attended. Three people, Hu Yitian, Shen Shiqiong, and Zhou Muhua, were temporarily elected as the presidium. After the chairman's report, Mayor Wu and Deputy Director Li of the Education Bureau gave speeches.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Wu briefly stated: All current problems must be calmly awaited. Regarding the elementary school teachers' desire to adjust their salaries, we must wait for the clear order from the central government to adjust the salaries of civil servants before making a decision. Mayor Wu expressed great sympathy for elementary school teachers, saying that we are unfortunately born as Chinese people and even more unfortunately born as Chinese elementary school teachers. The hardship of life is naturally unavoidable, but we must also deeply understand the difficulties of those in power. The government is constantly trying to find solutions for the people. For example, the recently launched industrial loan program, although it is clear that this move may lead to speculation and exploitation by some selfish profit-seekers, was resolutely implemented for the sake of the entire industrial community. As a result, the manipulation of gold and US dollar fluctuations by certain classes is clear evidence. Therefore, elementary school colleagues must understand the hard work of those in power and, even under the most difficult living conditions, hope to stay in their positions and work hard at their jobs.</p>
<p>Answering Questions</p>
<p>After Mayor Wu's speech, the elementary school teachers present raised several questions, which Mayor Wu answered individually as follows:</p>
<p>Question: It is rumored that the salary of elementary school teachers is clearly stipulated by the central government not to exceed the appointed level. Is this reliable?</p>
<p>Answer: I am not sure. If there is indeed such a law and it is considered inappropriate, colleagues can submit a request for amendment to the authorities through legal procedures.</p>
<p>Question: Why are elementary school teachers not included in the relief for winter clothing from the Executive Yuan?</p>
<p>Answer: Because the majority of refugees in this city have not yet received it, elementary school colleagues have not been able to receive it universally.</p>
<p>Question: Regarding the respect-for-teachers fund, why are some suburban municipal schools still unable to receive it?</p>
<p>Answer: This is a budget problem. I guarantee that it can be fully received throughout the city in the near future.</p>
<p>Question: The procedures for receiving [funds] in the past were extremely troublesome.</p>
<p>Answer: We will try to simplify them in the future.</p>
<p>Question: The Municipal Government bureaus adopt a seniority system, with a grade increase each year, while municipal school teachers require four years for a grade increase. It is hoped that this can be shortened.</p>
<p>Answer: A formal document can be prepared requesting this.</p>
<p>Discussion of Proposals</p>
<p>Regarding the five requests proposed by the municipal elementary school teachers, the following discussions were also held during yesterday's meeting: (1) There is currently no way to raise the base salary. (2) The issue of salary adjustment will be discussed after the central government's clear order on adjusting civil servants' salaries arrives. (3) There is no precedent for requesting 500,000 yuan for clothing assistance. (4) As long as there are no special difficulties in the procedures of the Finance Bureau, there should be no problem with requesting that salaries be paid at the beginning of each month. (5) It is currently feared that it will be difficult to collect a teacher's living allowance from next year. The association may first appeal to the Municipal Council and other groups. Another report: The private primary and secondary school association, upon hearing that teachers of municipal schools in this city are demanding that the municipal government make improvements due to the meager treatment, immediately sent a letter expressing their compassion and their willingness to wholeheartedly assist with this emergency appeal, hoping for a satisfactory resolution as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Jinghua Cup Pudong Cross-Country Race: Li Yufeng Wins Championship: Wang Zhenglin Finishes First in Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Jingye Sports Association, initiated and organized by Yu Weizhen, Chief of the Yangjing Police Branch, held the first Jinghua Cup Pudong cross-country race yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Residents of the Pudong area, young and old, came to watch this unprecedented event, which was one of the most enthusiastic scenes in cross-country races in this city. The details of the competition are divided as follows:</p>
<p>Competition Process</p>
<p>At around 8:30 AM yesterday morning, the area around the Dongchang Road Wharf in Pudong was crowded with people waiting for the start of the race. The race was originally scheduled to start at 9:00 AM, but because the large number of security police participating in the race had not finished their morning exercises, it was temporarily delayed until 10:00 AM. 171 people signed up to participate, and 143 people actually arrived. The famous long-distance runner Dumb Lou Wenzhao I was unable to attend due to illness. In order to increase the competitive interest of the racers, the organizers invited Lean Monkey Wang Zhenglin, the holder of the national record for 10,000 meters, to join in an exhibition. A total of 144 people started. After the opening ceremony was completed by all the staff and racers, the starting order was given, and 288 fleet feet moved towards their respective journeys. Li Yufeng, a new player from the Sixth Regiment, took the lead. When he reached Dongchang Road and crossed the Zhuangjia Bridge, Lü Honggao surged forward and ran shoulder to shoulder with Wang Feng. Wang Zhenglin also suddenly sprinted, breaking away and taking the lead. After crossing Zhuangjia Bridge, passing the Sixth Bridge, and heading towards Pudong Avenue, Wang Zhenglin was already 500 meters ahead of the first-place Li Wangfeng, and Li was 100 meters ahead of the third-place Lü Honggao. When approaching the finish line, with only 1,000 meters left, Lean Monkey worked hard to accelerate, sprinting fiercely amidst the warm applause of the cheering crowd, reaching the finish line first with a time of 31 minutes, 6 seconds, and 2/10ths of a second. Later, Li Wangfeng, Lü Honggao, and others completed the entire course of 98 people. However, the entire course of yesterday's race was estimated to be about 9,200 meters. Wang Zhenglin's result, calculated proportionally, if it were 10,000 meters, it would not be difficult to break his own national record.</p>

<h3>College Soccer Specialty Group: Nantong Wins Against Lixin</h3>

Xu Huiyong took the penalty, and the ball floated down, but Yuan Qin was negligent and watched the ball fall into the net, making it 2-1. The first half ended with Nantong in the lead. After the change of sides, the lineups of both sides remained unchanged. In the eighth minute, Lixin's defender Yi Lugen was penalized for a foul, and Li Kongjin took the penalty.

<h3>The United Group Abandons the Match Against Lung Kit, Spectators Dissatisfied and Demand Ticket Refunds, Friendship Match Fails to Finish</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In the First Division of the Football League, the Lung Kit versus United Group match, originally scheduled for 2:30 PM yesterday at Jin Yuan Park, with referee Jin Jiabiao. As the appointed time arrived, only eight United Group players, including Qian Changrong, were present. Consequently, they automatically declared their abandonment of the match to the referee. However, the game was changed to a friendly match and continued. As a result, both sides played very lazily, leading to numerous jokes. Over two thousand spectators, who had come to worry and cheer for them, were actually unaware of the situation. Some loudly complained that it was a waste of two thousand yuan to watch such a match. After the first half, the score remained 0-0, with neither side scoring. During the break, over a hundred spectators gathered at the ticket booth demanding refunds, but were unsuccessful. They then rushed into the field, causing the game to stop. Spectators from all around also gathered, surrounding the referee and demanding refunds. Jin Jiabiao immediately stated that this was not within his authority. The crowd then rushed to the ticket booth, shouting slogans such as "Drag them out!" Order was extremely chaotic. Eventually, the Football Committee agreed to issue refunds, totaling approximately six or seven hundred tickets, and the uproar finally subsided.</p>

<h3>The Tentacles of the Northeast Mainland: Lushun &amp; Dalian on the Eve of Takeover</h3>
<p>— Shenyang Air Dispatch on the 13th, Our Northeast Special Correspondents Pei Yuanyuan and Han Qingtao</p>
<p>Dalian is the gateway to the Northeast Mainland, a major port by land and sea, an international free port; Lushun is a military choke point, a fortress, a naval port, and a naval base. These two important coastal cities, reaching into the Bohai Gulf, form the tentacles of the Northeast Mainland.</p>
<p>According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Lushun Naval Port would be jointly used by China and the Soviet Union for thirty years. Upon expiration, it would be fully and unconditionally returned to our country. Dalian is an international free trade port. Recently, the central government is about to officially take over the civil administration of Dalian and Lushun. Simultaneously, the National Army has advanced to the boundaries of the Dalian urban area. Consequently, Dalian and Lushun have become a focus of global attention.</p>
<p>After fifty years of exploitation and transformation, Dalian and Lushun have become somewhat estranged from the motherland. However, the compatriots of Dalian and Lushun never forgot that they were Chinese, even in their final moments. Because of their innate Chinese identity, they were consistently discriminated against and driven by the Japanese in the past. Blood, tears, strength, and sweat created the prosperity of Dalian and Lushun, drying up the blood and sweat of the Dalian and Lushun compatriots. Now, one or two generations have passed!</p>
<p>The overturning of a blood-and-tear-soaked history of over fifty years, the vindication of over fifty years of suppression, was placed on the shoulders of the Chinese people after the liberation of the Northeast. But what was the situation in Dalian and Lushun for over a year? What did the compatriots of Dalian and Lushun see? The Chinese people have heard something, or even seen it with their own eyes. Today, everyone unanimously demands clarity and normalization. The government must take over the land and sovereignty, and no division or destruction is permitted!</p>
<p>National Army on the Edge of Dalian</p>
<p>This time, the National Army advanced towards Dalian from the vicinity of Fuxian—also known as Wafangdian. The time was noon on November 24th. The first target was Fuxian City on the China-Changchun Railway, as well as Chengzixu on the Jinzhou-Chengzixu Railway and Piziwo. In this way, they had seized the two "legs" of Dalian and Lushun, slowly advancing forward. From Fuxian to Pulandian is sixty li. By the end of November, Pulandian was also taken over. Pulandian to Shihe is twenty-five li, which is the boundary line of the defense area of the jointly used Lushun Naval Base according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty. At that time, there were still Soviet troops stationed there. In order to avoid misunderstandings, the National Army stopped advancing in the Tangfangtun area.</p>
<p>The National Army on the Jinzhou-Chengzixu Railway advanced along the route, and carried out mopping-up operations in the area between the China-Changchun Railway and the Jinzhou-Chengzixu Railway, marching southwest. Before December 5th, they reached the "crotch" of the two "legs" of Dalian and Lushun, that is, the meeting point of the China-Changchun Railway and the Jinzhou-Chengzixu Railway. The place is called Guangningsi. Then they flashed away from the railway line, operating in the vast area east of the China-Changchun Railway to the coastline. Dashang Mountain was used as a base.</p>
<p>Dashang Mountain, also called Laohu Mountain (Tiger Mountain), is the boundary of Dalian City. This line runs from Dashang Mountain through Heshangtun and Caojiatun, east to the coastline and then to the sea. The entire line is a large arc. From the southwest of Dashang Mountain, it passes through Nanshan and then extends westward, far away to Longwangtang near Lushun, which is the junction of the two cities of Dalian and Lushun.</p>
<p>Dashang Mountain is a high mountain east of Jinzhou. A unit of the National Army advanced southwest along the boundary line of Dalian City from here. South of Jinzhou City, also south of Jinzhou Station where the Jinzhou Civil Affairs Office is located, they crossed the railway. Jinzhou Station is the starting point of the Jinzhou-Chengzixu Railway. The National Army did not enter Jinzhou City or go to Jinzhou Station, but moved in the mountains after passing through Nanshan. A small part reached the vicinity of the Nanguan Railway Station, perhaps the outpost on the right wing of the railway line. At the same time, a small part was active in the Ganjingzi branch line, which can also be said to be the outpost on the left wing. In this way, they had entered the boundary of the Dalian urban area.</p>
<p>This happened around December 5th. It is said that at this time, the National Army discovered Soviet troops and stopped advancing again. This is because the National Army especially took into account the Sino-Soviet friendship and avoided unnecessary misunderstandings, waiting for a diplomatic solution. It is also said that this was to give the Communist Army a chance to withdraw automatically, so as to avoid war and further heavy casualties and destruction. Because the military authorities avoided making any statements about accepting Dalian, the details of the advance may differ from this article, but the reporter has started from many aspects and this is roughly the situation. From now on, we will only see how the Communist Army withdraws from Dalian. The National Army is now waiting at the door.</p>
<p>First Naval Port</p>
<p>Lushun stands at the southernmost tip of the Liaodong Peninsula, embracing the Bohai Sea with Penglai on the Shandong Peninsula, becoming the gateway to the Bohai Sea. It faces the vast sea and is surrounded by large and small mountains. After the management and construction by Imperial Russia and Japan, it has become the first naval port and naval base in North China.</p>
<p>The boundary line of Lushun starts from Longwangtang in the east, passes between Changlingzi and Longtou Station on Lushun Road, and extends through Tuchengzi to the Dachaikou on the northern sea. The main urban area of Lushun is in the southeast corner, and the southwest corner is occupied by mountains. Many villages surround the foot of the mountains. The same is true in the northwest corner. It can also be said that except for the plain area near the west side, the rest of the urban area of Lushun is almost all mountainous.</p>
<p>New City Street is in the west, and Old City Street is in the east, separated by a railway line and the half-cut Long River. Lushun Station is on the east bank of the river, also on the edge of the West Port. New and Old City Streets are connected by two bridges. New City Street has two rivers, and Old City Street has one river. Mountains, water, flowers, houses, and a seaside bathing beach make it a very neat and beautiful place.</p>
<p>The urban plan of Lushun, whether New City Street or Old City Street, is almost in the style of the Tsarist era. A part was added and expanded later, and the total area has reached 6.79 million tsubo. According to statistics: the city has 142,700 people and 324 villages.</p>
<p>There are "Luda South Road" and "Luda North Road" for transportation between Dalian and Lushun. The South Road is a modern highway. This road, about eleven li long along the coastline, is a modern "Tarmacadam-style" highway completed by the Japanese at the cost of 1.35 million yen over three years. The North Road is about fourteen li long, with many oak trees and many villages along the line. Starting from the urban street and driving along the railway line, passing Shuishiying, then through Sanjianbao, Tuchengzi, Yingchengzi, and crossing the Zhoushuizi on the Chang-Da Road to Dalian, it also takes one hour. On the Luda North Road, there is a railway line now called "Lushun Road", which also winds around the mountains and connects with the highway at times, connecting the passenger and freight transportation between Dalian and Lushun, as well as military use.</p>
<p>The "Tiger Tail Peninsula," with a tail-like terrain, constitutes a dangerous naval port. The West Port is wide, and the East Port is a small dock. Regarding the agreement on the Port of Lushun: the protection of the area is entrusted by our country to the allied Soviet Union, and the expenses are borne by the Soviet Union itself. After the expiration of the thirty-year period, all equipment and public property in the area, regardless of whether they are owned by the Soviet Union, will be returned to China unconditionally. Therefore, the current Port of Lushun is stationed and utilized by the Soviet army, which is completely blameless. The future takeover by our government is mainly the civil administration of Lushun. In terms of military equipment, our government will only use it jointly with the allied Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Beautiful City</p>
<p>Dalian is a beautiful city in our country. The green sea surrounds it on three sides, east, north, and south. Cherry blossoms planted by the Japanese bloom all over the mountains and fields in spring, dazzlingly beautiful!</p>
<p>The Pier District and Xigangzi are bustling commercial areas. The gardens and seaside bathing beaches of Xinggepu are picturesque. The industrial area of Shahekou is also very famous. A steel factory has more than 100,000 workers.</p>
<p>Dalian is a crossroads of Eurasian transportation. After arriving at Dalian by sea and disembarking, it takes ten days to reach Moscow to the north and west, and twelve days to reach Berlin. The sea distance to Shanghai is 544 nautical miles to the south, and to Hong Kong 1225 nautical miles. The sea distance to Osaka is 867 nautical miles to the east. In addition, it is 177 nautical miles to Yingkou and 157 nautical miles to Andong.</p>
<p>Dalian Port facilities: The waterways in the bay maintain a water depth of about 10 meters at high tide. The wharves include breakwaters about 5 kilometers long. The water area inside the dikes is 950,000 tsubo. There are also piers about 100 meters wide projecting into the water inside the dikes. Such long protruding dikes, extending 6 kilometers, can accommodate 40 ships of 5,000 tons to be berthed in the port, and large ships of 20,000 tons or less can be berthed arbitrarily.</p>
<p>The area inside the wharf is about 750,000 tsubo, which is filled in artificially. On the four main piers, there are four railway lines, and trains carrying 1,000 tons of cargo can come and go continuously. Along the coast, there are two- or three-story concrete warehouses. The passenger pier has a reception center that can accommodate 10,000 passengers. The internal facilities are fully equipped. There is a radio broadcasting studio on the roof of this building to guide ships at sea.</p>
<p>In the city center, there is a Central Plaza with a small park, city hall, court, bank, hotel, chamber of commerce, post office, consulate. On the circumference, eight main roads radiate in all directions from this central area. The residential area at the foot of Nanshan is full of Western-style buildings, exquisite and beautiful.</p>
<p>The water supply and drainage equipment in Dalian City is a noteworthy project. This large project uses the natural sloping terrain. All garbage, snow, feces, and other items flow into the entrance and can flow for thousands of miles, spitting into the sea. Due to the lack of rainfall and dry land, high reservoirs of about 20 meters and a depth of three or four kilometers were built in Wangjiatun outside the city and in the Longwangtang mountains near Lushun. Water is fed into the city's water supply pool through a 30-kilometer-long water pipe, which is sufficient for 1.5 million citizens to use.</p>
<p>According to a survey on May 18, 1940, the city's population was approximately 590,857, including 175,483 Japanese. There are two types of "National Schools" and "Public Schools" in the city. National Schools educate Japanese children, providing elementary education facilities. Public Schools educate our Chinese children. According to a survey in 1944, there are 37 National Schools with more than 24,000 students. There are 143 Public Schools with 85,000 students. There are four middle schools run by the government and one run by the public, with more than 5,000 students. There are a total of five higher girls' schools run by the government, public, and private sectors, with 6,600 students. There is one higher public school each in Lushun and Jinzhou. Although education can be said to be quite developed, it contains many toxins inside.</p>
<p>Dalian-Lushun Border</p>
<p>Traveling from Dalian to Lushun, starting by car from Dalian, you first pass through the scenic area of "Xinggepu," followed by the coastal amusement park, Heishijiao, Xiaoping Island, and Laozuotan Road. Continuing forward, you reach Longwangtang, the border between Dalian and Lushun, which is a large water source. The green shade blocks the road, the water source is clear, and the scenery is tranquil. Approaching Lushun, after passing through the Baiyinshan Tunnel, looking at the seaside bathing beach, you have arrived in Lushun. You can take a train or car on the North Road. The time for both the North and South Roads, plus the train line, is almost one hour.</p>
<p>The Japanese boast that this is a "capital of Eastern culture," and also a commercial port that ranks second among the five major commercial ports in terms of trade volume. Everything shows a new and active atmosphere. However, in its shadow, there are other cruel demons harming and exploiting our compatriots!</p>
<p>Regarding the Sino-Soviet agreement on the Port of Dalian: the interests of the Soviet Union in this free port are: first, to implement military control over Dalian during the war against Japan; second, to rent half of the wharves, warehouses, and all port facilities without debt during peacetime; and third, Soviet goods are exempt from import and export duties. The administrative power of Dalian belongs entirely to our country, and the peacetime military security also belongs entirely to our country. Therefore, when our government takes over Dalian in the future, it will take over all the property and rights of Dalian and sublease a part to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Japanese ruled Lushun and Dalian for fifty years, plundering the blood and sweat of the Northeast compatriots. In terms of material construction, there have been great achievements. A paradise built of blood, flesh, and tears has been destroyed, broken, and has changed its face, suffering great sacrifices. After fifty years, what will Dalian and Lushun be like tomorrow!</p>

<h3>On Large-Scale Industrial Organizations</h3>
<p>— Jian Guansan</p>
<p>The development of modern industrial organizations in the West has progressed through the following stages: First, small-scale factories were established one after another, causing family industries to lose their original position; later, large-scale industries rose up, and small-scale factories were either eliminated by technology or merged by large enterprises, leading to a situation of intense competition. As this situation evolved, the so-called "trusts," "cartels," and "concerns" arose, confronting each other like large armies.</p>
<p>The mergers of enterprises can be roughly divided into two categories: The first is the loosely organized "agreement of interests," such as "cartels" and "syndicates." Those who join this agreement only act together in accordance with the provisions of the contract, and their original independent character is not lost, as if one country and another country, although forming a military alliance, are still independent countries in terms of sovereignty. The second category is the tightly organized "enterprise merger," such as "trusts" and "concerns." Those who participate in this type of organization dissolve their original units and form a larger business combination, as if several small countries merge into a large country, and their respective independence is lost.</p>
<p>Whether it is an "agreement of interests" or an "enterprise merger," if they operate in the same type of industry, this is called "horizontal integration" or "integration of the same kind"; otherwise, it is called vertical integration or "integration of different kinds." The latter is more in-depth and more advantageous than the former. Japan’s Ishihama Tomoyuki said, "The monopoly system only showed its initial signs before 1860, and its major development was in the early 1890s. The 'cartel' was no longer in its youth, but in its adulthood. All raw material industries, mining industries, and metallurgical industries gradually tended to 'cartelization,' reaching the stage of monopoly."</p>
<p>If we point out the disadvantages of these large organizations, such as excessive greed, too fierce monopoly, manipulation of the market, and control of the economy, these are the most obvious facts. But since it is the most important organization in modern society, it certainly has its advantages: First, it has strong capital and can use the latest machines to promote industrial development. Second, it uses the latest technology to engage in mass production, and the manufactured goods are naturally cheap and of good quality. Third, because it is a large and well-organized organization, it is easier for the government to control. For example, it is much easier to control a few large steamship companies or trusts than to control many wooden boats. During the Anti-Japanese War, the reason why it was difficult to control prices in our country was, from the perspective of rent, because the economic units of agricultural society were too dispersed and the combination of new-style industries and commerce lacked a system, making it difficult to achieve effective control.</p>
<p>Germany can be said to be a relatively backward country in the history of the Industrial Revolution, but the reason why its industry was able to develop rapidly and surpass others is that it paid attention to large-scale organizations as soon as it launched the Industrial Revolution, which was not an unimportant reason.</p>
<p>Britain was originally a more stable country in industry, but when World War I broke out, due to the urgency of the war, it had to devote itself to "enterprise concentration" and further expand the organization of "trusts" and "cartels." After the war, in order to save the economic decline, it still devoted itself to this direction, such as the Lancashire Textile Industry Association, the Coal Industry Association, and the Lancashire Steel Industry Association, all of which are large and powerful organizations with strong capital.</p>
<p>Britain is blessed with unique conditions and a very suitable environment. In terms of industrial organization, it is particularly easy to develop in a large-scale direction. This trend can be roughly divided into two stages, namely, the 19th century was a period of expansion of production scale, and the 20th century was a period of centralized management of enterprises. Such centralized large organizations, such as Roma Fuel's Mobil Oil Trust, Morgan's Steel Trust, and Ford's Automotive Concern, are the most prestigious internationally.</p>
<p>China is now still hesitating between the old family-style industrial organizations and small-scale new enterprise organizations, far from the situation in the West in the 18th and 19th centuries. No wonder our country, on the one hand, has great difficulty in wartime management, and on the other hand, has insufficient equal production. Specifically speaking about factories, not only are there few in number, but also small in scale.</p>
<p>The company organization is the organization that is most capable of developing in a large direction in modern industry; but why is it easy to develop in a large direction and become a newer combination of modern industry? First, it is a legal person with its own independent and stable character. Second, it can gather many fragmented capitals together and generate great effects. Third, most of them are limited liability companies, bearing limited liability, and will not affect the assets of each shareholder outside the share capital due to the company's bankruptcy. Fourth, it has a shareholders' meeting, a board of directors, and a supervisory committee, which is somewhat similar to the style of modern democratic politics.</p>
<p>As for partnership and sole proprietorship organizations, they lack the advantages of a company and still seem to carry the atmosphere of the family industry era; not only are they too rigid, but also their scope is narrow, making it difficult to adapt to the needs of this era of large industries. The rapid development of modern Western industry from partnership and sole proprietorship to company organization has indeed been of great help. Chinese people are used to living in families in agricultural society, and their economic relations are often limited to families and local parties. They naturally do not trust such company organizations that use broad economic relations as ties and ignore them. The difficulty in establishing Chinese companies is undoubtedly significantly influenced by this psychological factor.</p>
<p>Even if they are reluctantly established, because people who have been immersed in agricultural society for a long time lack organizational concepts, some are willful, some are indifferent, and it is difficult to proceed smoothly and maintain them for a long time. Many industrial organizations in China are difficult to establish and quick to disappear; psychologically speaking, this is the feudal consciousness left over from agricultural society that is playing a trick. After industry develops, these consciousnesses will gradually disappear.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, some people may think that "once large-scale industrial organizations develop, they may violate the original intention of restraining capital." I believe that since the country's finance and transportation are all within the power of the central government, and all monopolistic industries have been determined to be within the scope of state-owned enterprises, then no matter which large-scale private industry, there is no need to worry that its hegemony will form an "economic warlordism." Such "warlordism" is likely to grow only in Europe and the United States, where private capital overwhelms national capital, but it is difficult to have its existence in the New China of the Three Principles of the People. Moreover, the means of restraining capital have different degrees of urgency in the early, middle, and late stages. Why should we give it severe restrictions in the early stages of infancy, causing the industry to fail to develop together? When the industry develops to the middle stage and seems to have a considerable scale, the state will naturally use progressive methods to levy temporary capital taxes, inheritance taxes, and excess profit taxes for financial or national defense reasons; and formulate disaster compensation laws, labor insurance laws, labor dispute settlement laws, and labor welfare fund-raising laws; directly seeking benefits for laborers and indirectly reducing the prestige of industrialists using capital and organization. When the industry is at its most developed stage, large enterprises have a monopoly and affect the welfare of the masses, the state will then take compulsory measures to nationalize them to achieve the goal of public enjoyment, which is not too late. The leaders of the British Labor Party have said: "It is actually harmless for factories to merge into large organizations. Because large organizations are easy to nationalize after a certain period." According to the Father of the Nation's views in the Industrial Plan, it is enough to prove that large-scale industrial organizations are the result of economic evolution, and finally, state-owned methods can be used to adjust and cure their own disadvantages. He said: "Large companies can save waste and produce cheap goods, which private individuals cannot achieve. Whenever and wherever there is a large company established, it will sweep away other small manufacturing industries and supply society with cheap goods, which is certainly a convenience for society. But unfortunately, large companies are mostly privately owned, and their purpose is to obtain more profits. After all small manufacturing industries are overwhelmed by them, they increase the value of each item because of competition, and the society is actually subjected to invisible oppression. The emergence of large companies is the result of economic evolution, which cannot be subdued by human power. If you want to save its ills, you can only organize all large companies and nationalize them by the people of the whole country."</p>
<p>The so-called "large-scale industrial organization" (large companies are only one of them) is the result of economic evolution, and its disadvantages can be adjusted and cured by the power of doctrine or planned economy. Why should our industrially young country be afraid and give up eating, fearing the disadvantages? We do not develop a capitalist system because we are concerned about its monopoly disadvantages, not even erasing its "large-scale organization." The so-called People's Livelihood or Socialist society is to promote and expand large-scale organizations to adapt to the "socialization" of production, not to abolish it, decentralize it, and return to a narrow economic system. Therefore, the large-scale organization of capitalist society is actually the foundation for establishing the People's Livelihood Principle. Without this foundation, just wanting to realize the People's Livelihood Principle on the ruins of small farmers or handicrafts is nothing more than a golden dream.</p>
<p>Looking at the increasing situation of state-owned enterprises in our country, even if private industrial organizations are allowed to develop in a large direction, they will not be too big to fail and create an "economic warlordism." In short, in the future, China's industrial management will focus on a planned economy and hold the central keys. Then, private industries can be allowed to develop as much as possible, so that both the public and private sectors can jointly devote themselves to industrial construction.</p>
<p>Therefore, state-owned industries must actively proceed in a large-scale direction, and private industries should also be encouraged to strive towards the same large-scale direction. Otherwise, hesitating and being caught in a dilemma, I am afraid that they will always stagnate halfway without the hope of rapid success.</p>

<h3>The Japanese Textile Industry After World War II</h3>
<p>— Deng Shaoqiu</p>
<p>Japan's textile industry was so developed before the war that it competed with Britain in the international market. In the fifteen years before the war, its speed of improvement and the effectiveness of its efforts were unmatched by any other country in the world. Its ambition to lead the world's textile industry was gradually turning from an ideal into a reality. However, good times don't last. This time, due to a moment of misjudgment, the warlords initiated the war of aggression against China, leading to the stagnation of various industries, with the textile factories suffering the most. The losses caused by the US Air Force's bombing during the war were enormous. However, since its unconditional surrender last year, it has been fully supported by the United States, coupled with its excellent national character, and is now gradually resuming operations. According to recent surveys, the completeness of equipment and the speed and precision of production in Japanese textile factories are astonishing. After our country's victory, we continue to do things our own way, being selfish and self-serving, and not seeking improvement, so the future is worrying. The current situation and advantages of Japanese textile factories are described below for the study of our textile industry and the vigilance of government authorities.</p>
<p>Although Japan's textile factories suffered considerable machine damage and economic losses in this war, the spirit of cooperation and the impetus for accelerated reorganization have gradually improved the situation in most cases. Among various industries, textiles still occupy a relatively advantageous position, and the reform of its equipment and the progress of its work are truly beyond expectations.</p>
<p>Silk The recovering Japanese textile industry is planning to revive its once world-renowned silk weaving industry on a large scale. There are two purposes: one is to export it in exchange for food, and the other is to supplement the shortage of domestic textiles. The Japanese silk weaving industry's five-year plan proposes to set up committees in the silk-producing areas and subcommittees in secondary areas to supervise silk production and control the allocation of mulberry trees and fertilizers. Currently, more than 50 million new mulberry trees have been planted nationwide. There are also plans to formulate a three-year plan for the production of Japanese rayon. Although the current monthly rayon production in Japan is only 20% of the pre-war level, this is because only 13% of Japan's rayon factories are currently operating due to a lack of coal or machinery. However, if these problems can be solved in a short period of time, the goal of the Japanese rayon three-year plan is to produce 60,000,000 pounds of rayon in 1947, and to increase it to 100,000,000 pounds in 1948. As for Japanese silk staple fiber, due to the shortage of various raw materials during the war, the protection and expansion has been significant. Currently, the number of workers is only 15% of the total national production. However, if the plan is implemented properly, the production of silk staple fiber in 1947 and 1948 will each be 60,000,000 and 100,000,000 pounds. Since Japan itself can only consume 11,800 pounds at most, the rest will inevitably be exported to the United States, China, Mexico, and other pre-war markets.</p>
<p>Cotton According to the investigation by the international textile inspection team to Japan jointly released by the US State Department and the Department of the Army in August 1946, Japan's cotton textile industry has installed 2,150,000 new spindles, of which 1,115,000 are usable. It is estimated that if the stored machine parts can be used and the damaged machine parts can be repaired, 3,228,500 spindles can be installed by January 1947. If repairs continue, the number of spindles will increase after January 1947. Japan originally estimated that it would need to import 225,000 tons of cotton in 1946 to make up for the shortage of domestic production, but recently Japan has been able to be self-sufficient. If cotton supplies continue in 1947, its inventory will be sufficient for at least two months of consumption. By the end of November next year, there will often be 144 million pounds of cotton yarn available for export. This year, in addition to 11.1 million pounds of cotton yarn and 900,000 pounds of cotton fabrics, Japan's cotton textile industry is expected to have 35,000 square yards of cotton cloth ready for export. At the same time, the US government's Commodities Credit Corporation will supply Japan with 890,000 bales of cotton this year, of which 185,384 bales have been shipped, and this cotton will be woven into cotton cloth for export.</p>
<p>Wool The recovery of Japan's woolen textile industry is also very stable. According to manufacturers in the industry, if the supply of raw materials is not difficult, they will be able to produce 25 million pounds of woolen yarn and 35 million pounds of blended wool and silk yarn within the next December. However, recently, no woolen raw materials have been imported, and the existing ones are not enough for the national industry to use for a month, so woolen products cannot be supplied for export at present.</p>
<p>The four major textile industries in Japan (including cotton spinning, rayon, raw silk, and wool) account for 75% to 85% of all new machinery industries in the country. Their capacity is sufficient to increase looms by 11,300 and spindles by 290,000 in 1946 respectively. By 1947, production spindles can reach 785,000 and looms can reach 16,800. They can fully restore the pre-war situation!</p>
<p>From this series of news reports and investigations, we can see how actively Japan's textile industry is recovering after the war. Looking back at our textile industry, although the government has taken over many assets this time, it does not use them well. It also harbors the hope of asking Japan's textile industry to compensate for our country's war losses, but the reality is not as convenient as we imagined. Chinese textile industry people, you can wake up too.

<h3>Implementation of Standardization</h3>
<p>— Xue Peng</p>
<p>Standard Tools</p>
<p>Although American factories are generally the most vigorous advocates of standardized products, their standardization of tools used in their factories is very backward. This situation is especially obvious in general iron factories. For example, we often see a group of lathes with the same size and function, but manufactured by more than one factory, and the methods of construction are also very different. Some have a lead screw with threads per inch, some have four threads per inch, and some have five threads per inch. Some gear teeth are multiples of ten, while others are multiples of twelve. These inconsistent variations are of course due to competition and the influence of artistic development. These machines of the same size but with different structural characteristics are not important to factories engaged in general and repair work. When the work needs to be designed in advance, this situation is greatly unfavorable. For example, if all machines are the same size and the structure is also the same, it will definitely be much simpler to prepare guidance cards. This need for standardization, if it causes general manufacturers to also adopt one or two standard characteristics for the same products, is not surprising. Maintaining a standard environment is also a necessary condition for standard work. What we said above, that textile factories must maintain a standard climate and humidity in order to get the best work, is a special case that illustrates this principle. This principle can be applied to any industry. For example, automatic machinery is impersonal. When it is working, it cannot get standard actions without setting up a standard time environment. Now, if the belt is loose or the tool is blunt, we certainly cannot expect it to have good results, just like when these elements meet the standard environment. If the human element also needs to be included, then the influence of this relationship will be even more severe, because human beings are more sensitive to the environment than machines. For example, a worker cannot engage in precise measurements with frozen fingers. Most workers are afraid to do familiar work in unfamiliar environments. Now, if machines of the same size and form and workers with the same skills continue to manufacture the same products, then after they are made, the cost of each finished product, if carefully compared, we will definitely see significant differences, although the reason for the difference is difficult to say for sure. This fact can illustrate the impact of the environment on work. Therefore, even if we admit that there are differences in the efforts of workers under normal circumstances, if we carefully study the work environment, the nature of the tools, and other identical elements, the difference in cost can be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Durability of Standards</p>
<p>This point seems very important. We have already said above that standardization has a tendency to crystallize manufacturing methods and procedures, thereby hindering the progress of industry. Therefore, the selection of standards should be very cautious. Even the standardization of tools mentioned in the previous section may hinder the progress of the industry, although there are considerable benefits at the same time. However, we should distinguish between standards with universal functions, such as weights and measures, and standards specifically used in a certain industry. The standard design, standard methods, standard tools, and standard environment we are talking about here are just the most suitable methods for engaging in a certain work at a certain time. If there are better methods in the future, this quasi-standard can still be changed.</p>
<p>Standardization and Individuality</p>
<p>Almost everyone agrees on the value and need for standardized products with strict uses. For example, standardized plows, telephone receivers, railway sleeping cars, automobiles, and floor tiles are probably not opposed by anyone. However, some people are always suspicious of standardization, fearing that this system will go too far and even affect people's artistic life. For example, thoughtful people are always unwilling to see standardized houses, even in factory towns. For the same reason, probably no one agrees with the extreme standardization or simplification of things such as windows, doors, building bricks, furniture, etc. Although architects do not oppose the standardization of concealed wiring ducts, light bulb sockets, and light bulbs, etc., he always hopes that the lampshades protruding from the walls will come from his artistic design. In addition, many similar proofs can be cited. In our country today, when the Anti-Japanese War has been won, industrial construction is very important, and it seems that standardization should be studied and implemented on a daily basis.</p>
<h3>Introduction to Business Administration</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>(4) The Problem of Unemployment</p>
<p>Among the unemployed, there can be divided into two types: one is people who are unwilling to work, and the other is people who are unemployed because there is no work to do.</p>
<p>Many goods cannot be permanently employed due to seasonal reasons. For example, those who specialize in making things for Christmas cannot permanently employ workers. If there is such a situation, then we can think from two aspects: the worker and the enterprise organization. On the worker's side, in order to adapt to the environment, they can find two jobs, doing one job in one period and another job in another period. It is not easy to get the ideal effect using this method, because the two periods may not be coincidental. On the enterprise organization side, if it originally only makes winter products, then it may as well make a summer product. This method can produce the following benefits:</p>
<p>A. Regular expenses can be averaged monthly.</p>
<p>B. Skilled workers can work with peace of mind throughout the year.</p>
<p>C. Other staff members can also have something to do regularly.</p>
<p>This is an enterprise management issue. Any competent authority that can think about the future of the enterprise will definitely be able to think of this method.</p>
<p>But sometimes, the market will encounter a downturn. The creation of the downturn has the following three steps:</p>
<p>A. At that time, the industry and commerce were very developed. Everyone had an optimistic attitude. The production volume increased greatly, and the banks were willing to lend money. Whether it was in the manufacturing process or the finished goods, they could be mortgaged.</p>
<p>B. But the merchants found that they had too many goods in stock (because they exceeded the limit and imported a large quantity of goods. Of course, they could not be sold out as scheduled), so they stopped selling. As a result, the manufacturing plants had to reduce production. Even if the wages of the workers were not reduced, they could not be increased. The purchasing power gradually weakened. Because the purchasing power was weak, the merchants' goods were even slower to find a way out, so they reduced the purchase again, and the assault factory produced even less.</p>
<p>C. But the workers' savings were completely used up, and they had to accept lower wages (it is better than having no work to do in the end). Gradually, they began to buy goods. The merchants saw that the sales of goods were improving, so they ordered from the manufacturing plants. The production volume of the manufacturing plants gradually increased, and the wages of the workers also increased, repeatedly reaching a prosperous period.</p>
<p>This can explain the origin of the downturn and the steps from the downturn to the boom. To avoid the occurrence of a downturn, it should be carried out from two aspects.</p>
<p>1. Manufacturers should not produce excessive quantities of goods.</p>
<p>2. Workers should not demand excessively high wages. 3. Because the manufacturing plants suddenly increased production, it would cause overproduction and sluggish sales. If the workers increased wages, then the cost of the goods would have to increase, affecting the sales of the goods, and it would also be enough to make the sales of the goods sluggish. After the sales of the goods are sluggish, the market cannot flow smoothly, and it will gradually embark on the road of a downturn.</p>

<h3>Remembering Li Qingya</h3>
<p>— Fu Jun</p>
<p>Around the years of the Republic of China 16 and 17, I remember being enchanted by Mr. Li Qingya's "Collection of Short Stories by Maupassant" during my middle school days. His fluent writing style was truly unique among the stiff and obscure translations of that time. Of course, we admired Mr. Lu Xun the most at that time, but reading his "Symbol of Melancholy" and "Worker Sui Huiluefu" and other works was a bit difficult, and even made us feel tired. Of course, my personal literary appreciation ability may not be up to par, and it is inevitable that I am too naive to rashly evaluate this literary pioneer; but at that time, no one would be critical of our eagerness for Western literary works, whether creative or theoretical, right? Seeing Mr. Qingya's fluent and refreshing translation style, I truly felt as happy as if I had suddenly discovered that I had arrived at my destination after a long journey!</p>
<p>After growing up, I never thought that I would have the opportunity to become an auditor of Mr. Qingya's lectures. At this time, I formally met him, and I felt a little disappointed. Because when we continued to read his articles, with his fluent writing style, coupled with Maupassant's beautiful and realistic content, we always thought in our ideals that Mr. Qingya was a dashing figure with long hair, a large tie, and a suave demeanor. And it was the first time we met, and the lovely shadow that had been kept for nearly ten years was destroyed like a bubble in an instant. It turned out that he had a bloated middle-sized figure, a plain flat top haircut, a gray cloth gown, cloth shoes, and a pair of reading glasses... When lecturing, his eyes were turned to the sky, and he did not pay attention to the students' movements at all. Slow speech and neat calligraphy were his characteristics. However, his criticism of many writers in the literary world at that time was quite severe. Although it was inevitably a bit excessive at times, it was mostly appropriate.</p>
<p>Mr. Qingya should be the first person to systematically introduce Maupassant's novels! I hope that Mr. Qingya will further promote French literature based on the introduction of Maupassant's works, so that the Chinese people can have a clearer face of French literature.</p>
<h3>Scattered Chapters Before the Window</h3>
<p>— Hu Mu</p>
<p>(1) Window</p>
<p>Tightly closing the paper window, I don't want to hear the city's traffic...people's voices...the sound of mud.</p>
<p>I want to think quietly, why are they so busy; window, oh the decoration of my life!</p>
<p>I imagine how good it would be to have no windows.</p>
<p>So that my eyes can see his eyes, so that my soul can approach the soul.</p>
<p>So, we all start to sing songs, singing songs of life!</p>
<p>Talking about the past and the present, so that there is no more loneliness and boredom in life.</p>
<p>(2) Morning</p>
<p>I get up earliest in the morning.</p>
<p>I like to recognize and look at the bright morning, the splendid clouds of dawn, listen to the joyful and unrestrained sound of the river, and the birds also hold grand concerts at this time.</p>
<p>I get up earliest, I don't like coal smoke, I don't like the turbid air in the city.</p>
<p>I don't like sound sleep even more.</p>
<p>Get up early. Because, I love dawn, I love sunshine.</p>
<p>(3) Door</p>
<p>Open the door, the sound of people and sunlight are flooding outside...</p>
<p>Outside the door, flowers are blooming with bright petals, and the green fields have just finished their night's dream.</p>
<p>Workers are all from the ribs of cattle window, there is still a line of weak bean oil light left, they get up, so, cart drivers, porters, washerwomen, rickshaw pullers... are all walking on the road of dawn.</p>
<p>I also comb my messy hair, put on a loosened red tie, and go out with the book version under my arm.</p>
<p>Go to paint the wilderness after a deep sleep, the awakened appearance.</p>
<p>(3) Sunshine</p>
<p>The weather with sunshine.</p>
<p>On everyone's face, a smile of youth is painted, and everyone's heart is full of grateful love.</p>
<p>The weather with sunshine. In the wilderness, there is a green field, the tawny thatched cottage, and a wisp of green smoke is rising from the roof, the small river is flowing excitedly, and the birds are calling more beautifully.</p>
<p>I breathe in the fragrance of the sunshine. So, I opened the snow-covered doors and windows, clapped my hands, jumped a little, welcomed the sunshine, welcomed the sunshine of life, come in!</p>
<p>So, I re-organized my boxes, and re-organized my youth.……</p>
<p>The dry breath of sunshine, made my heart full of green moss, and was resurrected again.</p>
<p>(4) Land</p>
<p>The land nourishes mankind. I am a child of the countryside, I should be proud to the city people, I should also thank the mother's land, I ask the children of the city, "Where does rice come from"?</p>
<p>The land is paved for us to cultivate.</p>
<p>For the sake of life, we should shed a sweat to the land, to the soil of our life. But, sometimes when layers and layers are pressed on the land.</p>
<p>In my heart, there is a cold confession, and a sad humming of winter songs.</p>
<p>(5) Shepherd</p>
<p>Every day, when I open the window, I look.</p>
<p>Spring, summer, autumn... he is on the back of the cow, gently driving the cow with a small, tender willow branch: from his smiling face, I can see that his eyes are still full of crystal tears.</p>
<p>Life, torturing him, has a back that cannot be stretched up!</p>
<p>The shepherd rides the cow and walks through the green forest. I only hear the remaining sad sound of the flute!</p>
<h3>Answering Mr. Boying's Poem Showing Him and His Friends Drinking Together</h3>
<p>— Zhang Shijian</p>
<p>I don't mind the early years of white hair invading, but I am happy in middle age with a moral heart; words enter into love like the sea, and poetry flows to repay the interest like Tinglin. Doctors must originally blame old faults, and when the arguments are in full swing, they will benefit the present; why should I use clay to think of retreating, and the old raincoat and shoes can be found again.</p>
<h3>Poems of Xuan Yin Lu</h3>
<p>— Pan Boying</p>
<p>During the years of the Republic of China twenty-two and three, Zhang Jun Yaoxiang and Cao Jun Liwu and I were neighbors in Zhenru Town, Shanghai. After the Japanese surrendered, we met and drank with Liwu at Xiang Lao's Golden Valley Village residence.</p>
<p>The children of different times are all courteous, checking and watching the white hair new; beyond expectations, the Golden Valley wine for ten years, in front of the lamp, nine deaths for the brown-clothed man, fighting sand used to come and go with the tide, changing the world still labors with arm bending and stretching, and it is suitable to give you a close game, and don't refuse to visit frequently.</p>
<p>The old friend's generous salary cut off the sound, and the old pivot opened the door and still recognized Yu; it is difficult to forget the feelings in the prosperous world, and the dramatic talk is happy and then develops into a Xuanqu; the feelings are somewhat light with clams, and the plans are sparse between the wild geese; raise the white wine and float the son Caozi first, this evening's flavor is like Zhenru.</p>
<p>Occasionally used</p>
<p>Jibei Liaodong is full of war, and Jiangnan is building a new house; I was surprised to hear that the Yan Han Dynasty was fishing for mutton wheat, and I remembered identifying the besieged city jade-faced man; the morning fog is cold and many flowers are about to bloom, and the virtual window sleeps beautifully with the feet first stretched, the dream is sparse and the court is paid tribute, and the Jun Tian Yan is not envious of being frequent.</p>
<p>Digging Clay</p>
<p>The old friend's strange festival has been high for a long time, and the four seas are still traveling; looking up to A Heng as the holy assistant, why does digging clay escape from people;</p>
<p>How can you sleep with your hands and get three dukes, and Xiaozhan actually retreated from the wind; the man of Shaoshi Mountain is not asking for a price, even if he does not come out, he will be empty.</p>
<h3>Portrait of Mrs. Cad</h3>
<p>— Ingres</p>
<p>Ingres (1780-1867) was a representative writer of classicism in France in the early 19th century. He and Dai Lak窃 were students of Da Zu, but his views were exactly the opposite of Dai's, and he tried his best to promote the restoration of the Italian painting tradition. The wind is cold and clear, and the picture emphasizes decorative beauty. He is one of the leading representative writers in the French art world. The sketch lines are beautiful, lively and sure. This picture is now in the Louvre in Paris, and the French regard it as a national treasure. (Lion)</p>
<p>Brief History of Musicians</p>
<h3>Beethoven</h3>
<p>— Tian</p>
<p>A German, who often lived in Vienna, and was known as one of the "Vienna Three Masters" along with Haydn and Mozart. The progress of Western instrumental music reached the stage of Beethoven and reached its peak. Beethoven's life was full of love tragicomedies. By the time he wrote his Ninth Symphony, he was deaf in both ears, and later he was troubled by illness and had frequent troubles. Beethoven wrote this song in all kinds of grief and indignation, and it became a timeless masterpiece.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood 130</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Both types of activities, whether supporting Konoe or opposing him, were obstacles to Tsurumi's work. From all indications, if Tsurumi wanted to get his hands on the secret of the "Seven Secret Letters," he had to break through these seven layers of defenses first. Moreover, due to various concerns, he couldn't engage in a grand and open struggle but could only proceed with covert designs.</p>
<p>Tsurumi's car sped for five or six hours, reaching the suburbs of Tokyo and entering the Yasusaka Chicken Farm. The owner of this chicken farm had studied abroad for many years, believed in liberalism, and was extremely anti-war. Within the Tsurumi group, he was "Number 07." In society, besides raising chickens, he also had a sign as a silent doctor but never practiced medicine. Now over fifty, he was exempt from military service. His chicken farm, though covering over fifty acres, had less than four chickens per acre because he emphasized studying bloodlines, chicken breeds, and the theory of chicken farming, not profiting.</p>
<p>This Yasusaka chicken farm invariably receives two visits from patrolmen each month. Ostensibly, it's to protect the chicken farm from petty thieves from outside the city who might come to steal and damage his business, but actually, it's because the political authorities consider him a "liberal" with unstable thoughts. The government has his record on the "blacklist," fearing his activities, so they frequently come to warn him. Logically, one or two warnings every one or two months should suffice, but why so frequent? This is due to the chicken farm owner being overly hospitable. Every time the patrolmen came, he always arranged fine food and drinks to treat them. The patrolmen, considering it official business, only wet their lips, feeling they weren't compromising their integrity, so they felt at ease. Initially, they came once every two months, and each time, it was only one person. After some time, seeing the owner's generous offerings, they called their friends and colleagues to come and feast. Feeling that two months was too long, they changed it to once a month and then cleverly created reasons to change it to twice a month. Each time, at least four people came.</p>
<p>Yasusaka, on the other hand, was happy. After spending a few dollars on food and drink, he got some benefits in return. First, the people in the surrounding countryside, seeing the patrolmen associating with him, thought he had influence and were very respectful to him. Second, since the patrolmen started visiting, petty thieves had disappeared, not daring to cause trouble. Third, and most importantly, his covert activities were not only not exposed but were even protected because, as the saying goes, "A person who receives favors is soft-handed, and a person who eats is soft-mouthed." The patrolmen, having eaten his food, always gave him a report of "being law-abiding and focusing on academic theory."</p>
<p>Since Yasusaka joined Tsurumi's work, his chicken farm became the main base of "Zero"-designated personnel in Beijing. Although they never held large meetings, small group discussions were always held there, making it a natural small group meeting place. They only needed to avoid the half-day when the patrolmen came for a free meal to be completely safe. Moreover, Yasusaka could manipulate this half-day at will. Just make a phone call, saying that the food and drinks weren't prepared that day and rescheduling, which was more effective than plague repellent. Even the five plague envoys of the emperor would certainly give way.</p>
<p>From Konoe's perspective alone, his villa in Beppu must have secret police patrolling day and night. Moreover, the Black Dragon Society and the Heavenly Lineage Society would naturally send people to guard and protect Konoe's safety. The most formidable were the German Fifth Column; they placed great importance on Konoe's personal safety because, due to their secret alliance, protecting Konoe was equivalent to protecting Hitler. As for how formidable these fellows were, one only had to see the tactics used against Tsurumi the night before to understand.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned two layers in the open and three layers in the dark, totaling five layers of defense, there were several more layers of unpredictable obstacles. Although these obstacles had complex reasons, they could be broadly categorized into two types: one type was emerging groups hoping to curry favor, so they sent secret agents to operate in the area, hoping to find some scraps of information to ingratiate themselves. The other type was secret organizations opposing Konoe personally or opposing the policies of Konoe's faction. They also had people infiltrate this guarded area to gather information on Konoe's actions as a basis for opposing or attacking him.</p>

<h3>Conscription</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Conscription work has already begun. The first step is to investigate eligible young men. According to the commander of the Shanghai Garrison District, the so-called eligible young men, according to the Military Service Law, are those from the age of twenty-one to twenty-five. If the number is insufficient, they will be supplemented in order.</p>
<p>We have always had the popular saying, "Good people don't join the army." Frankly speaking, this saying has harmed our country for hundreds of years. We have also suffered greatly from this saying during the eight years of the war of resistance. We are gradually correcting this erroneous notion. Now that the war of resistance has been won, everything is premised on nation-building, and conscription is also a peacetime recruitment and training, which should not cause some people to worry excessively!</p>
<p>People in any country in the world have served in the military. Good people join the army, only bad people evade military service, and such people are often despised by society.</p>
<p>If a counter-question is raised: Why don't you good people join the army? Because you good people don't join the army, which further exacerbates this bad phenomenon! Wouldn't those who evade military service be ashamed and have no place to hide?</p>
<p>Recently, I watched a movie: "Sergeant York" (translated as "God Gunner" in Shanghai). I have previously read a novel: "Higher Than Everything." I believe that anyone who has seen this movie and read this novel will be moved. Because Americans and British can be proud, and everyone has fulfilled their sacred duty to their country.</p>
<p>We love our country and should not shamelessly evade it. If everyone obeys the call of the military service law and actively enlists, please imagine what kind of effects its direct and indirect effects will have on this society!</p>
<p>Various Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Democratic Palace Former White House Butler's Report</h3>
<p>— Mengdie translated from the December issue of Woman's Home Companion</p>
<p>The following questions about life in the White House are answered by Henrietta Nesbitt, the former White House butler, in response to questions from the American people in the "Family Companion" magazine (Woman's Home Companion). Nesbitt served in the White House for thirteen years and has recently left office.</p>
<p>1. Is daily life in the White House very restrained and restricted?</p>
<p>Answer: Life is certainly more restrained than in ordinary homes. For example, those guests who come to play poker with Truman, or to chat with Mrs. Truman, or to date Margeret (the President's daughter) must stop outside the White House gate and be checked by the Secret Service protecting the President. Then they walk to the front porch, where a dignified host leads them upstairs. But on the floor above the official reception room, which is the President's family residence, it is the same as an ordinary American home—not restrained.</p>
<p>Molotov is the most difficult to serve</p>
<p>2. Who is the most difficult guest to serve in the White House?</p>
<p>Answer: It is Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, because we must be extremely careful to protect him. For example, when he is in his room, all the servants must leave that floor, and the servants are only allowed to go up to work after he goes downstairs. Molotov indeed made our work more difficult. In 1942, I thought this caution was superfluous. Because in wartime, with the protection of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, even a mouse could not run into the White House to threaten him.</p>
<p>3. Does every guest in the White House live comfortably?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes. The guest rooms are very large and comfortable. Each room has a radio and the latest magazines. Guests eat breakfast in bed; they can play tennis on the White House lawn and swim in the pool. They do not have to abide by strict rules or rituals, so they are free to do what they like. What the guests are most honored about is that they can visit the White House. Who wouldn't want to sleep in Lincoln's bed and tell their family or relatives in the future?</p>
<p>4. Do White House guests take souvenirs?</p>
<p>White House guests take things without asking</p>
<p>Answer: Yes. In my thirteen years of service, I simply cannot estimate how many spoons have gone missing. Many linen towels have also disappeared in the bathrooms, so I had to repurchase them. After I posted prohibition signs, that part of the items was no longer taken as souvenirs. But one day, when the White House was opened to the public for visits, we found that the lace of our best red satin curtains in the East Room had been cut off by the crowd.</p>
<p>5. Are the beds in the White House comfortable?</p>
<p>Answer: When I first went to sleep in them, I thought they were comfortable, but Roosevelt's children had slept in them for many years, and they said the beds were not good, the springs were broken, and the pillows were hard. After I re-softened the mattresses, the families of Roosevelt and Truman, as well as Democrats and Republicans, and officials from various countries did not say the beds were uncomfortable.</p>
<p>6. How is the life of Roosevelt's grandchildren, Hopkins' daughter Diana, and the princes and princesses who sought refuge from the Netherlands and Norway?</p>
<p>Answer: They rarely have children of the same age to play with, and they are always watched by nannies and officials, so life is very uninteresting.</p>
<p>Only on Palm Sunday in 1943 was their happiest day, because that day Washington City had an unseasonable heavy snowfall. The children slipped away from their nannies, took two large aluminum trays from the kitchen, and skied on the sloping lawn of the White House.</p>
<p>The children sometimes had pillow fights on President Roosevelt's bed, and Roosevelt watched and judged them. Roosevelt was never happier than on the day of his fourth presidential inauguration, when all fourteen of his grandchildren came.</p>
<p>White House dogs enjoy themselves</p>
<p>7. Are the dogs in the White House as restricted as the children?</p>
<p>Answer: No, they are much happier than the children. Truman's family does not keep dogs; but Roosevelt's family has never been without a dog. The American people all know about the happy life of Roosevelt's Scottish dog, Fala. The second famous dog in the White House is a French poodle, Suzie. It was brought by Mrs. Hopkins when she got married. It is small and gentle, but it always eats on the carpet.</p>
<p>8. Are the food in the White House bought in bulk or retail? Are they delivered by phone or bought at the market?</p>
<p>Answer: All methods are used. I buy canned beans and potatoes in bulk by phone, but I also go to farms near Virginia and Maryland to buy fresh vegetables.</p>
<p>Simple menu</p>
<p>During the war, all the food in the White House was transported by a special Secret Service car, inspected in the food laboratory of the Department of Agriculture, and then sent to the White House kitchen.</p>
<p>9. Is the daily menu in the White House extravagant?</p>
<p>Answer: The menu is as follows:</p>
<p>Clear soup Roast platter Fragrant bamboo shoots French fried potatoes Waldorf salad (cold dish) Bavarian chocolate ice cream Coffee</p>
<p>10. The menu for entertaining guests in the White House:</p>
<p>Clam Cocktail Beef soup</p>
<p>Turtle Corn bread</p>
<p>Boneless capon Jam Peas</p>
<p>Butter beets Sweet potatoes</p>
<p>Cheese watercress cold dish White cake</p>
<p>Almond ice cream Coffee</p>
<h3>A Scene in the White House</h3>
<h3>San Mao</h3>
<p>— Zhang Leping</p>
<h3>The device used by the woman in the picture is a newly produced British "facial iron." It is first placed in hot water to heat up, and then the vanishing cream is applied to the iron and pressed hard to evenly apply the vanishing cream to the face.</h3>
<h3>On the Phone</h3>
<p>— Cai Xue</p>
<p>This is the Q&amp;A on the phone:</p>
<p>"Is Mr. Zhao Jianan here?"</p>
<p>"Not yet."</p>
<p>"Will he be here soon?"</p>
<p>"Maybe."</p>
<p>"Well, after he arrives, please ask him to give me a call."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid that's impossible."</p>
<p>"Who are you?"</p>
<p>"Universal Funeral Home!"</p>
<h3>Official Price and Market Price, Everyone is Happy</h3>
<p>— Shi</p>
<p>Gold is rising step by step, and prices are following suit. The end of the year is approaching, which is "joy for some and sorrow for others"!</p>
<p>Gold has a distinction between "official price" and "market price." The official price is the "rationed price," and the market price is the black market price. To crack down on the "black market" to save people's livelihood? Therefore, in the past, "official price rationing" was implemented. Now, the "official price" is also like a rabbit race, following behind the "black market" at a "rapid pace"!</p>
<p>Therefore, today's gold is truly "official price and market price," "everyone is happy"! Buddha said: "Excellent, excellent!"</p>
<h3>Minister Yu Hongjun, Who Came from a Reporter Background</h3>
<p>— Inguo</p>
<p>Yu Hongjun's history in the political arena is not long, but his development has been faster than anyone else's, starting from the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government, then Acting Mayor, then Vice Minister of Finance, and to today's Minister of Finance.</p>
<p>He is from Guangdong and graduated from St. John's University, so he speaks English very fluently. Before he stepped onto the political stage, he was a reporter for the Shanghai English newspaper, the Da Mei Evening News. In terms of personality and talent, he met all the conditions that a reporter should have. He is lively, resourceful, good at socializing and activities, and especially good at verbal responses, which gave him even greater help. If he had continued to walk the path of a reporter, he could have become a famous reporter and occupied a position in the Chinese news industry, but he finally embarked on the path of politics.</p>
<p>When the "August 13th" battle broke out, Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng was appointed Chairman of Guangdong Province, and the Acting Mayor was Yu Hongjun, who was then Secretary-General. When the National Army withdrew to the west, Yu went to Hong Kong. Due to helping Kong Lingkan, the representative of the "Central Trust Company" in Hong Kong at the time, with business shortcomings, he was valued by Kong Xiangxi, who was then the "Minister of Finance," and was appointed Vice Minister. After Kong retired from the political stage, the "Minister of Finance" was Yu, and he remains so to this day.</p>
<p>He has a very forthright temperament and has absolutely no so-called "official airs." Precisely because he came from a reporter background, his attitude towards journalists is satisfactory, answering all questions. If he has time, he often chats with reporters in the office. When he chats happily, he will unreservedly put his feet and legs high up on the desk, leaning back in the swivel chair, almost falling down. Then, the reporter can also sit on his desk and continue talking to him.</p>
<p>During the "August 13th" Shanghai war, when Yu was Acting Mayor and hosting reporters, a reporter asked him about the location of the artillery shells fired by our army. Yu replied with a smile: "I didn't go out with the artillery shells." From this "ingenious answer," one can know a little about Yu's ability to deal with journalists.</p>
