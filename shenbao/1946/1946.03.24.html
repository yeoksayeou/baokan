<h3 id="c1">王外長向參政會報告　蘇軍決四月底撤盡對我照會已正式答覆 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿三日電〕王外長世杰，今日下午出席參政會作外交報吿時稱：我國政府已於廿二日接到蘇聯駐華大使彼得羅夫答復我國政府前於三月六日爲催請蘇軍即行撤退事，送達蘇</p>
<p>正式照會之覆文。彼得羅夫於該項覆文中稱：蘇軍巳在陸續撤退中，並聲明至遲將於四月底完全撤退，對該項覆文，我政府現正考慮答覆中。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿三日電〕與去年十一月十七日事件稍異之二次長春撤退，可望於今晚潦草完成，但以董彥平爲首之軍事代表團人員及趙君邁市長所屬長春市府人員，傳仍將繼續留駐。已接收之各省府人員亦然，因彼等如亦撤退，則蘇方將謂我自動放棄責任也。此次撤退原因，係由於蘇方一則作即將非正式撤退之姿態，另方面則通知華官方，本月廿三日後，我方空軍人員應即退出長春機塲，並不得繼續使用，三則蘇方阻止我由瀋利用長春鐵路運兵赴長。在此情勢下，蘇軍一旦突然撤出長春，即有成爲四平第二可能，故官方遂將不必要之留駐人員撤離也。今日爲長春撤退最後一日，平市晨曦中即機聲軋軋，片刻未停，政府似在用盡其一切可用之飛機，以運回非必要留駐人員·近數日來常有東北各省主席留平家屬向東北行營請願速送回其夫，免作張莘夫第二。哈市廿四日公祭李兆麟，共軍要求參加，經交涉渠等決派代表一八〇人入城，但安全由楊市長負責，惟楊之保安隊早經蘇軍繳械，警察亦然，届時情况如何，無人敢加判斷。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿三日電〕王外長今日在參政會宣稱，關於東北問題與蘇聯交涉經過，將向參政會提出書面報告。據政府方面稱，東北蘇軍撤退範圍，或不包括大連在內，該地蘇聯方駐有重兵，此外如旅順，中蘇條約中曾規定由蘇軍駐防，恐亦不在撤退之例。</p>
<p>長春蘇軍續撤退　我接收人員一批返錦</p>
<p>〔本報長春廿二日電〕今以八機運走接收人員一大批，然於運走接收人員之另一面事實，則爲蘇軍之縱續撒退，謠言　起，食糧價格騰漲（月初大米每斤不及十元，刻已賣至十七元掛零）以及人心之不安。記者今晨曾隨搭機返錦之接收人員去機塲，使悶居城市內數月來之煩膩心情稍得一換，城中積雪早融，而郊外原野依然爲厚雪封蔽，目擊沿途若干大建築，過去爲蘇軍兵營者，現已冷落蕭索，門窗不整矣。卡車行近機塲時，値崗盟軍曾發生誤會，嚴厲檢査車上人員，經請得聯絡官來，始得通行無阻。迄目前止，滿炭大樓中尙有接收人員多人，但往日每餐飯開四次者，今已减成兩次，且大樓亦不若往日之嘈雜。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春廿三日電〕蘇軍撤退聲中，現有若干矛盾現象發生，此種現象最顯著之一，即蘇方之空軍數目，日來已較前增多。</p>
<p>〔中央社哈爾濱廿二日電〕哈市空氣仍極緊張，市區週邊，現由蘇軍駐守，雖禁止武裝共軍潛入市區。然據悉，截至廿一日止，潛入市內共軍的在五千上下。</p>
<p>〔聯合社瀋陽廿三日電〕瀋陽現有中國·日本及蘇聯居民二百萬，該地現完全由國軍駐防。瀋陽市長董文琦近令挨戶施行搜査，此或爲市面逐漸安謐之原因。傳共軍現離瀋陽三十至九十里，正在退却中，國軍正向東、南·北三方推進。又據中國軍方消息，孫立人所屬新一軍，已開抵鐵嶺，正向四平街推進中，國軍第五十二軍一部份，已開入撫順，新六軍亦已佔領遼陽。</p>
<p>〔中央社錦州廿三日電〕遼陽·營口間之平原地一帶，近一週來結集來歷不明之武裝部隊，幾及十萬，頭目及其幹部多操山東及蘇北口音，所用武器多爲日本製造，且附有朮砲甚多。</p>
<h3 id="c2">共軍要求已部份容納　津浦路繼續搶修　隴海東段短期內可完成 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔本報濟南廿三日電〕津浦各綫修復問題，已獲解決，路局搶修隊日內即將執行小組，派員率領出發破壞地段，繼續搶修。聞此次商談時，山東區共軍要求執行小組，承認共軍組織之交通機構及分區管理，小組當即部份容納，準予在搶修期間，共軍方面從事搶修之工人及技術人員，可由政府發給待遇，餘待後議。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南廿二日電〕泰安秩序，逐漸安定，人民已能自由貿易，國典雙方議定，不准工作人員混入，雖曾發現少數携有工作證件及法幣之八路軍糧秣人員，從中套購，惟一般情况尙良好。</p>
<p>〔中央社徐州廿三日電〕隴海東段積極搶修中，二十二日修至大許家與八義集團八十六公里處，除此徐東破壞最重者，尙有五公里，逾此五公里，路綫破壞較輕，運河站以東至白塔埠九十四公里間，路軌均尙完好，僅白塔埠至河屠問二百三十七公里破壞須修復。路局曾擬由海州向西搶修，但爲共軍拒絕。按隴海東段徐州至連雲市，計長二百二十三公里，被破壞者共七十八公里，現已修復二十公里，其餘五十八公里，如無阻碍，短期內即可完成。又津浦北段刻已修至韓莊以北六百二十一公里處，距臨城尙有十九公里，交通第二十四小組，仍在韓莊監修。</p>
<h3 id="c3">膠東各地共軍設卡強徵損稅 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>〔本報濟南廿二日電〕靑島訊，膠東各地共軍，擅改即墨縣爲即西縣，並劃分牙山縣牙前縣牙後縣五龍縣等，委任地方官吏，破壞政令統一，共軍並在交通要道，設卡强徴捐稅，人民處於水深火熟中。又山東各縣爲共軍盤據，百分之八十五左右人民，顚汕流離遍地失榮及失學靑年，形成目前魯省最嚴重之問題。據關係方面估計，中學生失學者凡百分之六十以上，小學生則達百分之八十以上，魯省各地現已開課之中學，僅有五十一校，惟濟南市即佔其中二分之之。</p>

<p>張治中展期赴迪化</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿三日電〕關於派遣軍事調處執行小組赴東北一事，在本月十一日馬撳爾將軍返美前夕，經軍事三人小組會議通過原則，惟到達東北後之具體方案及執行之切實辦法尙需有所商定。原擬於本月廿日前得有結果，俾張治中能於廿一日離渝飛赴迪化，惟關於派遣執行小組赴東北問題，歷經張氏與中共代表周恩來氏及吉倫將軍多次會議與個別商談，延至廿日止，尙未獲得協議。周氏並已於廿一日飛往延安請示，張部長爲等候周氏返渝繼續會商，期能獲致協議，其赴迪化行期，不得不展緩數日。</p>

<p>〔本報重慶愛廿三日電〕廿二日上午，參政院對宋院長之質詢，達於最高潮，如以歷屆參政會對孔前院長之質詢而觀，則會塲空氣之憤激與熱烈，實尤過之。如以二中全會對宋氏之質詢而言，則此次之砲聲，足以使其掩沒無聲。黄宇人聞宋院長的政治報吿後，說目前的政治現象犯有二病，一是推，二是假，三是亂，不知宋院長亦承認有此二病否？朱惠淸批評政府的黄金政策，說這是詐索，背信，欺民的事。又有人雨，宋院長上台時，大家懷着熱望，現在大家失望。胡秋原說，豈僅是失望，已是絕望不遠了</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿三日電〕參政會今日上午八時廿分舉行第五次會議，由政府代表邵力子與張羣分別報告：（一）政治協商會議經過與（二）停止軍事衝煅恢復交通曁軍隊整綱及統編中共軍隊方案，本次大會增列此二項特別報吿，頗具特色。會議由吳貽芳女士主席，出席參政員一五八人，帝聽人數今日突增，大會秘書處昨發出旁聽證三十張，顧維鈞，吳鐵城均到會。主席宣布開會及秘書處報吿後，首由邵力子出席，作政協會議報吿，按此項報吿原擬請孫科祖任，今適孫院長因公赴北碚，改由邵氏出席報吿，邵氏爲國內團結問題及政協會議，曾不辭艱苦，盡力奔走，故對政協會議經過情形極爲熟悉，渠對（一）政協會議以前（即召集政協會議原因），（二）會議經過及（三）政協以後階段情形，分別扼要說明，詞畢，繼由張羣報吿停止軍事衝突，恢復交通曁軍隊整編及統編中共軍隊方案，分述三項商談經過，並特別指出政府始終以忍讓爲國之精神，與中共商談，乃在　量使和平統一得以實現，俾人民得以休養生息，國家得以從事和平建設，十時半報吿畢。會議休息十分鐘後，繼續進行，書面及口頭詢問，計共五十一起，各參政員僉對政協會議之決議及恢復交通，整編眾隊已實行至如何程度極表關切，並歷舉各地共軍不遵停止衝突命令，肆意騷擾人民之事實，允多慷慨陳詞。最後，邵力子對各項詢問中關於政協法律地位代表產生與保證實施等問題，提出簡單答復，大會並通過參政員尹述賢等臨時動議，提請對本次會議兩項報吿設立特種審査委會審査案，下午一時半散會</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿三日電〕邵力子向國民參政會報吿政治協商會議之決議稱：政府決心全部付諸實施。張羣論及停止衝突協定時稱：政府爲薪致和平團結，不惜作極大之讓步。渠稱：馬歇爾將軍來華目的，原爲協助中國履行對聯合國之義務，並於遣送日僑回國之工作上促成中美合作，但因情勢轉變，使馬氏不得不於解決中國外交問題外，同時處理國內問題。張氏復稱：當前美國駐華大使赫爾利在任時，渠原先建議之軍隊國家化辦法，國民黨與共產黨軍隊之比數爲七與一之比，共產黨要求六與一之比，最後所成立之協議則爲五與一之比。張氏透露：軍隊國家化之決議，經七次會議始行成立，此項協議，完全根據馬歇爾之建議，而非根據國共任何一方面之建議。</p>

<p>— 張其昀</p>
<p>「少數民族」一名，中國本未有之，這是從西文翻譯出來的。最早使用這名詞者爲誰，作者不很淸楚。第一次大戰以後，美國政治地理學權威鮑曼博士著有「戰後新世界」一書，（I．Bowman：New　World一九二一年出版）經作者及友人譯爲中文，由商務印書館刋行。我們曾把英文Minority一字譯爲少數民族。海內學者似未能詳審異同，往往用少數民族一詞來通稱我國的邊地各族，變成很普通的稱謂。其實中外國情諸多不同，我們對於一切名辭；應該循名責實，愼之又愼，吾則漫爲援用，勢必發生種種困難。</p>
<p>什麽叫做少數民族，先舉一個實例來說。捷克是中歐一個國家，人口一千四百餘萬，其中有日耳曼族二百萬人。逍些日耳曼人與七千萬德國人是同種同文，因語文宗敎及歷史關係，對德國有濃厚情感，無形中認德國爲其祖國。故捷克境內之日耳曼人稱爲少數民族者，係兼對德國而言，非僅對捷克而言。歐洲與中國不同之處，即中國自秦漢以來向爲統一國家，歐洲自羅爲衰亡以後汽未統一，彷彿中國春秋戰國時代，羣雄爭長，版圖易色，民族的界綫與國家的疆界兩者不能吻合，顧此則失彼，此種情形在歐洲東部尤爲顯著。故少數民族問題乃歐洲政治上極嚴重的問題，學者稱之爲衝突地帶，處理不善，即足以釀內變而召外患。第一次大戰以後國際聯盟倡導締結少數民族條約，由各有關國家保證其實行，其故即由於此。</p>
<p>中國悄形完全不同，中華民族的領土和中華民族的地理分佈，大體是相符合的。中國與蘇聯及印度諸國爲隣，但在中國境內並無斯拉夫人與印度人的雜居區域，故少數民族一詞在中國就不能適用。中華民族是一個大家庭，漢族好比長子，滿　回藏諸族都是兄弟手足。二千多年以來，純渦多少次的遷徙混合及彼此通婚，至今各族語曾信仰生活習慣雖有不同之處，而在血統上並無嚴格分野可言。譬如滿族又稱旗人，我們知道淸初的旗人包括了漢軍旗和蒙古旗，就是滿人本身也不知經過多少　遷，其中參合了渤海契丹女眞高麗及明代遼東漢人的多種成分，那裏有所謂純粹的女眞後裔。其他各族如蒙如回如藏以及其中諸多支祇，都可作如是觀。凡是讀過中國歷史的人，應該都能具有同感。</p>
<p>民族究竟靠賴什麽力量形成的呢？語言不是主要的，例如加拿大一部分說英語，一部分說法語，而無害於爲一欣欣向榮的民族。宗敎也不是主要的，例如比利時北部近荷蘭信奉新敎，南部近法國信奉舊敎。生活習慣更不是重要的，古人所謂廣谷大川異制，民生其問者異俗，版圖愈大，其經濟狀况亦愈複雜。形成民族的主要力量不是別的，乃是共同的歷史，共同的回憶，共同的紀念和共同的精神。例如美國可稱爲一個新歐洲，歐洲各國的移民都有，在歐洲他們祖先原是互相敵視，一至新大陸他們十孫却能精誠團結，此乃由於美國精神瀰漫全國所致。美國精神的由來，即爲獨立戰爭南北戰爭及兩次世界大戰的共同回憶及華盛頓哲斐孫林肯威爾遜輩偉人物的共同紀念所造成的。故一個民族之所由成立，不僅由於地理，而允在於歷史。元史是中國正史的一部分，成吉思汗不僅爲豪族之大人物，亦爲全體華之民族英雄，宗喀巴也是全民族所公有的。</p>
<p>中華民族的歷史是一部悲喜交集甘苦與共的歷史，漢滿蒙藏回族猶如一個手掌五枚手指，其中有中華民族的血交琉在一起。漢族可比拇指，是歷史上的活動中心。我們內部有問題，那是我們家裘的事，自己可以商議解決，無待他人起而代謀。假使一個手指被外力割斷了，會使整個手掌痛苦不堪，流血不止，這就叫做民族的意識，統一的大義。古來學者嘗用「邊徼四裔」一詞來通稱吾民族的幾個支派，用現代語來說，便是分居邊地的幾派子孫，這原是很正確的觀念。所以我們應該根據舊說，稱之爲邊地諸族，或簡稱曰邊民。『少數民族」一名起於舶來，根本是要不得的。</p>
<p>明白了這種道理，就知道憲法中絕對不能有「少數民族」的字樣，即退一步言，於憲法中規定邊地諸族之特殊待遇，及致失去了一視同仁的雅量，也是大可不必的。憲法與一般法律不同，憲法所應注重者爲立國的主義與夫根據主義所創設的政治制度，至於一般政策往往需要因時制宜，因地制宜，只要在普通法律中規定就够了。例如沿海居民以捕魚爲生計，憲法中不必另立一條保護沿海的漁塲，閩廣一帶方言紛歧，有福州話，廣州話之類，憲法中更不能有明文規定以維持此類方言。海疆如此，大陸邊疆何嘗不然。作者以爲中亞高原的牧民與沿海漁民應無歧視，蒙藏諸族的語言與閩廣方言也看不出有何大相逕庭之處。至於宗敎自由乃國民權利應有之義，邊地各族當然亦無例外。</p>
<p>準此而談，今後對於邊地各族應有之政策，已可昭然而勿疑。民族主義終不可廢，我們目前還看不出除了民族國家以外有更好的組織可爲新世界的單位。政治家的責任是要替國家造成向心力，不是請他們來背道而馳，替國家製造離心力。各地方言雖不必禁止，亦無從禁止，但國語和本國史地則是每一國民所必須學習的。邊地各族的生計尙多回於遊牧生活，或爲半耕半牧之狀態，此固由於地理環境之影響，但生產方法與交通狀况亦大有關係，因之其生活程度較之東南海疆不逮遠甚，豈有任其辛苦艱難不加改進之理。「以工興農（包括林牧漁業）以農養工」的經濟建設，固應普遍實施於全國。至於地方自治爲立國之大經大法，但邊地不能另有所謂高度自治，致與內地諸省有所不同。美國要把阿拉斯加改爲新省，美國原有四十八省，此後要有四十九省，就是這個道理。國父嘗說國內民族一律平等，這眞是建國的指導原則，旣云一律平等，除了適應環境的原則以外，便不必再有特殊待遇。</p>
<p>作者絕不敢漠視邊民的利病，亦不諱言過去邊地確有民變。有淸一代幾次回亂，曾使西北諸省騷然不寗。但是政府處理的方針，應該與對付內地民變並無二致。左宗棠所謂「但分良莠，不分漢回，」足以說明中華民族之傳統精神。加强邊民之向心力，其道在於肅淸貪汚，修明吏治，視愼選縣長刷新縣政爲建國之眞正基礎，這又是全國性的改革，初不限於邊地爲然。要之今日中國邊疆問題危機四伏，考其原因，非自內發，而由外鑠。新疆問題蒙古間題這些足以搖撼國本的大問題，不發生於抗戰方殷之時，而發生於和平恢復以後，其故何在，極可注意。反過來說，茍中印二國能友好相處，西藏必可安然無事。民國三十三年拉卜楞黄正淸司令代表藏胞到重慶獻金購飛機三十架，不是藏族傾心內向的明證嗎？旣知中國邊疆問題不在內而在外，我們必須認淸事實，明辨是非，先有舉國一致的與論，然後政府對外交涉方可有堅定不移的立塲。</p>
<p>再者國際聯盟保護少數民族之條約，根據於威爾遜總統的民族自決之原則，表面上很動聽，實際不免困難叢生。一國之內有了少數民族畛械之分，正如古人所說「非我族類，其心必異。」旣然把一塊土地劃給某一國統治，同時對於這個地方的人民另有條約保護，以致本國政令施行有了種種限制。這些少數民族旣非完全本國人，又非完全外國人，人民時時懷抱異志，政府則常感進退失據。少數民族問題爲釀成第二次大戰重要因素之一。故學者對於威爾遜總統民族自決原則之應用不當，頗多攻擊。至於在外國軍隊佔領下所舉行的公民投票，硬從祖國的懷抱裏挖了出去，而美其名曰民族自失，這與城下之盟會何少異，作者亦不忍多說了。</p>
<p>或有問曰，中國之大眞是沒有少數民族問題嗎？答曰，彷彿有之，是即散布東北的朝鮮農民，其人數幾有百萬之衆，簡稱爲鮮農問題。其嚴重的情勢已經超過了普通外僑問題，倒與少數民族有些相像。自從朝鮮獨立脫離中國以後受了日本種種壓迫，一部份農民越境遷移，在我遼吉二省墾田種稻，其情可憫。但日本利用鮮農爲其侵略先鋒，他們往往不受各地縣政府的統治，而歸日本領事館所指揮，中國農民有時反爲鮮農所欺凌，在吉林延邊一帶（即日人所調間島）造成了喧賓奪主的形勢，這是很可痛心的事。九一八以前東北爲中國外交上最多事之地。緊接着瀋陽事變之前，有萬寳山事件，就是因爲長春鄉間朝鮮農民妨害水利，與中國農民發生衝突，同時日本在朝鮮鼓動排華風潮，當時作者曾至長春萬寳山及朝鮮新義州等地實地考察，深感形勢嚴重，空氣鬱悶，有山雨欲來風滿樓之慨。回到南京方才月，而瀋陽事變突馮爆發。査捷克因少數民族問題而成爲第二次大戰歐洲方面的導火錢，就此點言，遠東亦有類似情形。此次捷克人恢復故土，痛定思痛，主張把該國境內二百萬德人驅逐出境，因爲戰時他們曾有危害祖國的舉動，覺得處理少數民族祗有此法。中華民族的民性向來是悲天憫人，寬大爲懷，對於東北的鮮農，應與朝鮮政府交涉，願遷回朝鮮者聽之，願歸化入籍者聽之，吾則應與一般外僑受平等待遇，但根本談不到少數民族自洽問題。</p>
<p>左宗棠曾說，『保新疆所以保蒙古』，唇亡齒寒是千古的定理，倘使蒙古不保，則東北亦岌岌可危，萬一新疆蒙古相繼喪失，長城一帶立刻成爲邊塞，則中原諸省亦無寗日，亡國之禍，迫於眉睫。所謂領土完整主權獨立自應包括整個中華民國而言，吾則破碎山河何得謂之完整。無論蒙族回族和藏族，他們都是中國人，是四萬萬同胞的一部分，他們決不是中國境內的斯拉夫人或印度人。古人嘗謂「一言喪邦」，作者竭誠希望少數民族一詞不再聞於議塲之中，見於報章之上。而且今後民意機關，應該就邊疆問題發表宣言，義正辭嚴地昭吿於世界，使外國人從此不得歪曲事實，有所藉口，這眞是國家無上之福，民族無窮之幸。</p>

<h3 id="c41">敵僞產業處理局一時未能結束　上海部份截至二月二十日止　接收物資逾萬意　軍火逆產及未定案之物資尙未計算在內 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕蘇浙皖敵僞產業處理局成立迄今，已近五月，所接受物　之價値究有多少？頗爲各界關心。記者昨承該局秘書沈善鋐君以上海部份至本年二月廿日止之此項數字見吿，惟上海以外各地之物資，則因尙未統計完全，未能發表。茲將該項數字誌次</p>
<p>（一）物　（包括倉存物資査緝物資德僑商行貿易公司及藥品等）二九八三億，（二）工廠（包括廠房）一五四六億，（三）房地產及傢俱五八三億，（四）碼頭倉庫三三八億，（五）金銀錢幣證券三〇四億，（六）敎育文化機關一一七億，（七）船舶九三億，（八）農塲漁收四六億，（九）糧食及易壞物品二六億，（十）燃料一一一億，（十一）軍輛二〇億。</p>
<p>以上共計六千零令七十餘億。此項估價，係以三十四年十二月底之上海市價爲標準，若以最近市價估計，當在一萬億以上。再所有軍火，逆產，及嫌疑物資尙未定案者，均未列入。</p>
<p>漢奸財產處分問題</p>
<p>至於漢奸死亡之後，其財產如何處分之問題，據最初行政院令，可以沒收，但最近司法院令，則謂不能沒收，故該局現已電呈行政司法立法三院，請會訂辦法。此外，漢奸之兒女是否能承繼此項財產，亦尙無明確之規定，故現行法令似有不足，俟新辦法決定後，當均可解決。該局對此項財產，現在先予調査，再加接收及淸點，山該局負責或委託保管，但暫不處理，例如漢奸嫌疑犯之子女，“前仍可住居其故宅。須俟法院判決確定之後，然後再由該局處理。</p>
<p>清算部份賬務極繁</p>
<p>該局設立之初，行政院本指令限三月內將敵僞產業處理完竣，但因事實上不及趕辦，曾准延期，故至今已近五月，以現在情形觀察：關於產權糾紛及物資處理等事，於三個月內即可吿一段落。惟逆產之處理須俟法院之判決，而法院審奸，恐尙需相當時日，此外關於淸算部份，因賬務極繁，費時亦多，故該局雖已逐漸收縮範圍，並遣散若干職員，而預料逆產及淸算二部份，勢不能早日結束。，</p>
<p>改組之後計分三組</p>
<p>目前該局內部組織，經上月改組後，分爲十三組：第一組負責處理及運用各種物資，包括房屋，工廠，倉庫；及平價品之發售等，現凡　該局決定處理之房屋，由該局發封後，由該局交中央信託局保管，屋內傢俱是否發售，亦由信託局決定後辦理。第二組負責評價估價。第三組負責處理產權糾紛。至該局之審議機關房地產運用委員會，每星期開會一一次，各機關向該局請撥房屋者甚多，即由該會商議決定。</p>
<p>發還汽車根據號碼</p>
<p>記者因西報對發還汽車事曾有批評，特向沈君詢問，據答稱：八年之內，滬人所失之汽車達二千輛，而由　該局發還者不及一百　，其他　輛，並非該局留難不肯發還，而實係原軍已不知去向。現向該局聲請發還車輛之車主，祗須將原車引擎號碼報吿，由該局向公用局査核，因戰前請領車照時，有此號碼之紀錄，而此項材料，公用局幸得全部保存。近日向公用局請領車照時頗多由該局扣留者，此種「黑車」，即因引擎號碼發生問題之故。敵偽產業處理局已竭其全力，使物歸原主。又車主於任何地點，如發現其戰時所失之幸，祗須引擎沁碼相符，則無論該車現爲何人佔用，該局亦必毫不徇情，予以收回發還。</p>
<p>水電公司數處發還</p>
<p>〔又訊〕處理敵僞產業審議會對於處理華商倉庫封存物資，近有補充決定，凡在敵僞盤踞時期，商民人等因環境關係，以他人名義購存貨物，但與敵僞無關，經貨主提出殷實舖戶或同業公會出具書面担保，准將封存物炎發還。又審議會，昨日通過發還船舶五艘，又發還上滄閘北水電公司自來水廠，上海內地自來水公司，上海英商自來水公司，浦東自來水公司，安慶電廠等，內浦東自來水公司係父由上海市政府收回，安慶電廠由資源委員會收回。</p>

<p>據確息：中央銀行昨晨十時許，在該行召集棉花進口商，紗廠代表及有關指定銀行代表，舉行會議。出席者有貝總裁祖詒，財政部顧問楊格博士，外匯審核處處長林維英，業務局局長林鳯苞等，商討關於棉花進口結匯一事，結果如下：多數棉花進口商廠商，曁有關指定銀行，對於棉花進口結匯，未能完全依照外匯新辦法辦理，顯係不明規章所致。中央銀行有鑒於國內棉花需要甚爲急切，在情形許可之下，一部份棉花價叔，已結外匯者，准予供給。其他一部份囑於相當時間內糾正該項交易，以免有關方面蒙受投失。其已裝運及已訂的而尙未售出之棉花，經中央銀行於此次會議後，統盤計劃，認爲現有大批棉花行將湧到，足敷現時市塲數個月之需。在今後市面供給及需要情形尙未充分明瞭以前，特建議棉花商及廠商，承做該項新交易時，　特特別愼重，以免發生上海碼頭貨物堆積擱壓之不良現象云。</p>

<p>染織棉布紗業等三公會向主管當局申請發還敵偽產業處理局對接收</p>
<p>僞棉統會移交餘剩紗布</p>
<p>一案，幾經波拆，聞產業審議會將車行考慮，是誠一個應請主管當局鄭重考慮之問題也，我人於此，殊不欲再高談法理，因依照法理，前被敵人强佔之產業，當局原可査明發還，非特法理之所當然，且亦敵產處理原則之所明定者，紗布在民國三十二年八月爲敵僞强迫抑價收買，給價不及當時市價四分之一，其中至今猶有四分之一價款未曾領取，其爲强佔，其爲有四分之一以上之紗布係無償强佔，事屬實在，絕不容有所諱飾，產業審議會於此，自必有公允合理之辦法，以解此糾紛，惟我人於此，尙有不能已於言者，有少數人士或以爲此次之申請發還，係三公會自身之行動，被害紗布廠號並未有此企圖，則於事實爲大　不然，不容不重言以聲明者，在抗戰時期，被害廠號早已在暗中預備，及抗戰勝利，各會員之以書面或口頭向公會負責人催促向政府力爭發還者，多至不可勝數，几已塡就委託書件。</p>
<p>委託公會力爭</p>
<p>並刋登廣吿，向蔣主席及各界求援，句日前染織業公會召開會員大會，其第一個決議案，即爲督促公會負責人認眞辦理此案，棉布業公會及紗業公會將於本月廿四日及廿六日召開會員大會，亦早已有大批會員聯名提出議案，請公會加緊力爭，事實具在，豈公會負責人所能假借，夫以紗布廠號受害之深，現狀之困難，謂爲對於被佔紗布可以墮　不顧，豈合人情」。或謂前此之强迫收買，給價雖低，其間曾搭發黄金，以金價之上漲而言，被害人宜已有所取償，則我人應請作此言者，將當時之紗布價及金價詳細計算，並將黄金遲發時之黑市金價與黑市紗布價再一爲計算，以明</p>
<p>黃金不足補償損失</p>
<p>抽著『敵僞强迫收買紗布餘剩額應吾發還之我見」册子內，已有明白之計算，指明敵僞所發之黄金，如以每次發給時之黑市申合，再加上其所發鈔票，被害廠號實領之價格，僅及當時紗布市値之百分二十九有奇，原文具在。絕無牽强」。</p>
<p>或又謂國難未已，政府財政困難，敵僞產業之收入，將爲國家建設及彌補財政之泉源，商人應當體諒，竊以爲財政雖窘，當局未必採此政策。</p>
<p>僞棉統會所收純係國人紗布</p>
<p>絕無敵僞紗布在內，當敵僞强迫收買時，曾另立機構以統制敵商之紗布，絕非僞棉統會所得而過問，若以國人紗布爲敵偽强佔而去者，即指爲敵產，當非政府之本意，且與敵產處理原則不合，財政上之困難，明白加稅可也，向工商業徴求捐獻亦可也，豈容混統含糊，以失法理之平，即退一步而言，當局如需紗布以作軍需，正可明白向所有人平價徴購，紗布廠號協助建國，從不後人，當不致有異詞，又豈容牽强沒收，致蒙攘奪之嫌。</p>
<p>接收敵產，幾關數易，辦法要更，僞棉統會所移交之紗布，巾途已有一部份變賣，並有一部份已移作他用，此或亦爲富前一個待決問題，但以管見所及，</p>
<p>變賣有可查者</p>
<p>可發還價款，其計算並不困難，其中已移作他用者，祗須用途正當，平價結算可，勸被害廠號明白捐助亦可，更不値得顧慮，紗布廠號在敵僞鐵蹄之下受屈已久，今獲重覩天日，不可不謂爲大幸，如能喩之以理，補償所失，以愚個人之見解，宜無不可商量者，讀者須知除紗廠所失或已另有取償外，全市之染織廠棉布號紗號正引領以求此案之合理處理，深望政府當局勿專在財政收人上着想，被害廠號勿專在法律上深求，則和氣致祥豈不盛哉。</p>

<p>東北烽火燎原，崦軍關部工作擴至東北一事，似需相當時日，始克實現。因關於派往東北執行小組之任務　　，迄今尚未商妥。傳周恩來對此問題，曾提兩種辦法：一種是執行小組在東北，任務爲調查，然後根據調查情況，由執行部或三人會議解決，另外一種辦法，是三方對東北軍事政治問題，先求得解決原則，然後派小組前往執行，一般判斷，如馬歇爾於最近返華，當可加速東北問題之解決。目前東北之混亂與時俱進，四平街陷後，哈爾濱長春情形亦極度緊張，該兩處蘇軍，極可能如四平街之突然撤退，但軍事當局對此，亦略有佈置。</p>
<p>各國巳委曲求全　蘇有求必應</p>
<p>此次圍攻四平街之共軍，指揮官爲呂正操，係分四路由遼源·昌剛·八面城·梨街四路進兵。中共近在東北之指揮巳統一，軍事由共軍唯一挾有機械化部隊作戰之林彪指揮，政治由周賓忠負責。。</p>
<p>各國對蘇聯巳極盡委曲求全的能事，而蘇聯外交上的收穫，也可說有求必應，大可躊躇滿志了。但是種種的外交突擊姿態，種種出人意料的要求，一串一串的爆彈，仍在不絕地抛擲出來，使戰後本可寧靜的世界，重復陷入驚風駭浪之中，蘇聯顯然不能卸其責的。抑且，土地的要求（對土耳其）特權的索取（對中國），又與帝俄何異？煽動自治獨立，分裂他國領土地（在伊朗中國），又與希特勒何異？依勢要挾，背棄條約（對中國），又與帝國主義之猙獰面目何異？在聯合國可以現況得希臘政府同意而駐紮的英軍爲何不撤，而在東北的蘇軍則可以任意違反規定，遷延不撤麽？可以責備英軍在印度尼西亞的壓迫自治運動，而在中國則可以煽動本來毫無問題的邊地民族猖而強行分割領土以三十中國的完整主權麽？這此姿態，這些手段，既表明其爲無限度的安全要求（自然妨碍別國的安全），推其極更足威脅着世界的和平，這顯然是超越趔的非法舉動了。</p>
<p>各國猜疑集中點　將使蘇孤立</p>
<p>我們即單就中國講，三民主義的中國，過去從來沒有威脅過任何一國，今後也永遠不會侵略任何一國。這由於我們具備自給自足的優越條件，而自然陶成愛好和平，敦邦睦隣的立國精神。我們惟一的要求和任務，是保持領土的完整和維護主權的獨立。此番大刦之後，且當努力於復員建國，正要借助偉大的蘇聯友邦，推誠合作，共同促進人類的和平幸福，蘇聯有何理由放心不下，既巳剝其皮（外蒙），又欲扼其喉（新疆），而更要絕其生命綫（東北）呢？</p>
<p>我們所以不憚煩地檢討蘇聯戰時戰後的外交，仍是本着菩薩心腸，期待蘇聯珍惜過去的光榮，而勿輕易任他消逝。不是麽？東北問題是嚴重了，其實加（拿大），蘇美蘇，黃蘇的局勢，又何嘗不緊張呢？一國的處境，如果成爲各國猜疑的集中點，就是將近淪入孤立的迹象，而孤立決非國家之福。第一次大戰後，蘇聯的孤立，是外來的，不近情，不合理的，如果第二次大戰後，蘇聯再芳陷於孤立，就是自招的，很難博得人間的同情了。事實很明白，今後世界的前途禍福，取決於五強的能否合作；五強間中，美，英，法四強，縱然還有着少數問題未能及時順利解決，然而所謂少數問題是比較單純，四強愛護和平是比較誠意，外交態度是比較開朗，所以前途是不容有過人的悲觀的。而且四強對於蘇聯的真正需要和其外交手段，雖同樣感有「捉迷藏」的煩惱，却又無不同具委曲求全，維護和平的誠意。所以轉捩局勢的關鍵，祇　操在蘇聯的掌握。東北問題是蘇聯外交引起世界不安現象中的一環，我們不僅期待蘇聯立刻懸崖勒馬，作英明的，眼光遠大的，命題的解決；一步更希望蘇聯基於趔的觀點，盱衡世界潮流，對現行外交策略重作一番賢明透澈的。帝俄時代的作風不必說，就是蘇聯在敏感國際解散前的策略路綫，也絕不容再度運用。務使群疑消失，共登合作幸福之域，不也「猗歟盛哉」麽？</p>
<p>化戾爲祥，繋於一念之輾轉，整個人類未來的命運，是登天堂，或入地獄，也就決定於這一轉之間，我們相信偉大的友邦—蘇聯，必將知所抉擇。</p>

<p>— 本報長春廿日訊　特派員岳寗</p>
<p>國軍進入瀋陽，此間人士聞訊似由寒冬驟然步入春天。雖此地此時猶有陣陣寒風吹人心冷，但僉認以往佈滿天空之陰霾，似將漸爲惠風所吹散。蓋　蘇軍確巳如時撤離瀋陽，，　美總領事斯塔鳩巳抵大連，並從事建立美領館，　蘇對美有關東北照會業巳答覆，雖內容未經宣布，但此象徵險惡之遠東風云，巳趨緩和。而　奔走中國國內和平之馬歇爾之返美，一般更認爲饒具意義。凡此種種，實足以說明東北之外交或可由此步入正軌。</p>
<p>然際茲猶有令人不能不特感隱憂者，東北之接收尚存有若干阻碍。此即　黑龍江合江兩省府接收人員久滯哈爾濱，不能分赴北安佳木斯接收。且今日軍事代表團團員楊作人巳北國赴哈，照料兩省人員之返長。而此兩省於一個月又十八天前，係　由蘇派聯絡官陪赴哈市者。至哈僅經蘇方告以地方不靖，不能前往，遂令　居。詎料現在更有「黑龍江新政府建立」之說，謂於去年十一月即告成立。此時間無誤，則去今當逾四閱月之久，「新政府建立」與「地方不靖」顯然不能「統一」。黑省接收受阻以此，合江當出於同樣情形。　報載吉林亦有組成省府之消息，周保中「將軍」任「主席」。周保中詳歷不明，僅事實指陳，去年十一月十四日長春市府爲劉居英接收時，渠即茲某國軍裝以黃中校自稱，出沒於市警察局，大肆招兵買馬，而今乃脫去某國軍裝，一變而爲「主席」。再如僞滿時謳歌「日滿協合」之作家古丁（原名徐長吉）於去年十一月時，在此間之寬城子自稱爲「募兵委員長」，凡能號召一連人者爲連長，一營者營長，今則亦聘任吉林之「教育人民委員」。此類揭竿而起，擁兵求官者，當爲數極多，此兩人活動於長春者有時，故人能道其所以，　八路在東北類極複雜，有爲分類者，計洋八路（流亡國外八一五以後歸來者），土八路（對洋而言），大八路（地位較高者），小八路，真八路（延安系），假八路，橡子麵八路（當地人組成），以他們在僞滿時吃橡子麵），大米八路（關內來者，他們以爲關內人全食大米）。渠等自去冬以來，即盡力擴張，以中長路言，瀋陽去大連檢查，瀋陽來長春，於鐵路檢查，長春至哈爾濱，於　　檢查。凡檢查之地，皆爲渠等彙結之地。每當車至其地時，除檢查外，並高呼有無「中央接收人員」，果被發現，結果當不難想像。但有蘇聯絡官在車上者，情形例外。　遼北省於一月八日前往接收。省頃四平始終即在八路軍控制之下。近四平發現鼠疫，該地蘇軍繼瀋陽蘇軍之後全部撤退，此爲十三日夜間之事，目前對四平情形尚難斷言，惟僅知者，該省之開源縣長爲八路軍所俘，昌圖縣長業巳撤退。而遼寧省之鐵　，據交通界消息，該地電訊局今爲八路軍所佔據，瀋陽長途電話，相當受阻碍。</p>
<p>綜觀全局，陰霾固將吹散，然此許多困難問題尚待解決，不過此類困難問題當易解決，且解決時絕不令人有窒息之感。</p>
<p>重慶訊：東北共軍之一元化運動，在林彪·聶榮臻·呂正操三個共軍首腦策劃下巳略見成效。東北共軍外國部隊楊靖宇及高毅兩部，巳部份易幟，惟實力極薄。撫順周圍之張學詩部，自認爲人民軍之正統，其番號仍時隱時現。東北共軍現需龐大之軍費，爲便於吸收東北雜牌軍隊，正以種種「遠心」之方法，開闢財源，今日南京晚報刊出之北平專電，謂共軍巳公開由關外運輸鴉片至平津各地銷售。</p>
<p>瀋陽蘇聯經濟電業工業等代表十二人，據云來自長春，日前訪董市長，希望現由警察看守之工廠及産業等交與渠等開工及作其他處理。董婉詞謝絕，告以市府未得政府命令前，蘇方不能運用。緣蘇軍撤退時，曾將工廠，倉庫，房屋四十一處，交與市府看管。據蘇方稱；該項産業係遠東貿易局，遠東銀行運輸局及秋林洋行等所購置，惟據我方調查，多係敵僞産業故董市長巳呈請政府核辦。</p>

<p>— 本報十五日成都航訊　青楓寄</p>
<p>成都—這被詡爲「小北平」的四川唯一盆地，只要你曾到過，你將永遠對它懷着依戀，假若你沒到過，那你一定更會感到心神響往和無限惆悵。</p>
<p>它是四川省的省會，三國漢的國都，環城四十多公里，一望無垠，在這全省被山佈滿的蜀中，自然更使你深得這城市的可愛了。古蹟，名勝相當的多，如諸葛武侯祠，杜工部草堂，望江樓，薛　井…等等，其他如近代修築的劉湘墓，工程浩大，設計周詳，却也相當宏偉，精織。以上的幾個地方，更是遊人如織，熱鬧非常，自從卅年掘出五建墓後，把這成都點綴得更是古色古香了，而少城的屋宇，正典的大門，三合或四合的平房，院子的寬敞，花園的設備等，也都無一不酷似故都。抗戰八年間，敵機不斷的轟炸，雖然使得蓉市市民在精神上物質上受到巨大損失，但是無形中却助長了市面的繁榮。就拿祠堂街來說吧：馬路寬闊，市容一新，這却不能不說是轟炸的「賜予」。春的成都，據說是最美，最可愛，不過因爲記者來去匆匆，不免如走馬看花，疲於奔命。現在僅就所見，略述一二：</p>
<h3 id="c96">最大投機市場設在破廟裏 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>提到安樂寺，恐怕誰都知道，因爲它是成都最大的投機市場，同時也是川西的唯一投機市場，它位居市區中心，相傳是漢安樂公劉禪之寺，因此它的聲名也頗赫赫，不在成都之下，不過你假若要見到的話，那你一定不會相信，因爲這樣一個享有盛名的西蜀最大投機市塲—每天成交若干萬萬以上的地方，却是那麽一座寒酸的破廟，僅僅有着一座陳舊不堪，不很寬大的大殿，和幾十張桌子，桌子旁邊坐滿了茶客，在茶客空隙和後面再圍滿人，不是高聲談行情，就是低聲講交易，最近因爲津·滬一帶金鈔的陡漲，百貨的回揚，使得這寂靜將二個月的安樂寺，又變得活躍起來，上午一到九點鍾左右，寺外就排列着數百輛私包車，寺裏擠滿了人，有銀行經理，地方士紳，有大家閨秀，富戶姨太，總之全是些有錢有閑的朋友，他們都想投機，他們都想發財，他們都想成爲第二個黑寡婦。這是一個精干女子的綽號，她是一個寡婦，皮膚頂黑，最初不過只是安樂寺門口一個擺紙烟攤的，後來多少賺了點錢，於是跑起安樂寺來，恰好那時　鈔交着紅運，百貨追隨躍踊，她竟在半年內賺到了一二千萬元，因之「黑寡婦」之名大噪，交際塲中，大宴會中，居然也添上了這麽一位貴婦。但其中却也不管爲吃飯而專門跑腿的可憐小搪客。</p>
<h3 id="c97">摸袖風氣盛贊　是罪惡淵藪 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>這裏的摸袖之風很盛，　　錢大都把自己的手伸到對方的袖子裏，伸出三個或二個指頭表示數目，即使男女間，也很大方，誰都不會感到男女有別，授受不親的，我曾看到許多高貴小組，太太也不惜將粉手讓對方那雙被烟燻得發黃帶有汗臭的粗手一摸再摸，因爲大家都爲了爭「利」，只要能多賺些錢，就讓對方佔點便宜又有什麽關係呢？</p>
<p>殿前有一塊大空地，攤子很多，是西藥和烟紙業的大本營，他們却高舉指頭，大聲喊價，很少摸袖的，進門的過道上，却是錢幣高聲，自從黃金市塲「轉移陣地」後，這裏已經減色不少。</p>
<p>這兒真可以說是罪惡的淵藪，雖然多少人在這裏發了財，但是也有不少的人在這兒栽了觔斗，是勝利剛降臨的時候吧！多少常跑安樂寺的人被物價，金鈔的慘跌，壓得喘不過氣來，逼得走頭無路，只有自殺，服毒，但是曾幾何時，人們又聚集到安樂寺來了。投機家們！你們也該警惕些，別重蹈了覆轍！</p>
<h3 id="c98">成都文化心臟　忙亂而不寗 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>華西壩—這是成都的文化心臟，同時也是高等學府的集中地，金大·華大·齊大等，除了用大在望江樓，燕大有一部份在城裏外，其他大都集中這兒，周圍環境很好發，研究氣氛也很濃厚，如果拿它與重慶的沙坪壩相比，那真是天壤之別，沙坪壩只是零亂，繁囂，而華西壩却份外的整齊，安靜，尤其是後壩的長堤，當春深夏初的時候，楊柳長垂，情侶雙雙，我相信年青的朋友到了這裏，恐怕誰都不願再回去了。一響安靜慣了的華西壩，現在是變得忙亂不寗起來，不能再保持以往的安寗了，雖然春色漸深，但後壩却沒往年熱鬧。情侶少了，兩堤的垂柳，也今冬沒有往年那麽綠得有生氣了。</p>
<h3 id="c99">青年宮的花會　今年捧捧敲 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>青羊宮在西門（通惠門）外，幾科已經成爲了每年花會的當然會塲，提起「花會」；之名字多麽呌人響往，每年都有許多外縣人，趕去觀花，其實事實上會塲上的花還不得種種農具，種籽來得出色，所以我以爲與其呌花會；倒不如叫農會來得適宜。</p>
<p>今年因爲是勝利後的第一次花會，所以省府建設廳特准擴大舉辦，而地租也因之較往年爲高，（去年花業公會就是因爲地租過高，一氣而體沒有參加。）據方丈說：「我們每年只有這次捧捧敲，不像別人可以一年敲到頭。」這照話說來，彷彿他們的「敲竹槓」倒是應該的了。</p>
<p>花會裏除了花市外，有農具市，種籽市，桶市，雀市，鐵器市，瓢市，畫畫市，筆硯市等，其他尚有賣古玩，虎皮膏，　，鞋，綢緞，玩具，刀剪，梳蔍，玉器，珠寶等等的，價錢大都比市面要貴，但是買的人却不少，尤其是風車，更是盛行一時，無論大人小孩，只要去看守花會的，回去大都人手一只，附近的茶餐館，大都編松柏爲　，生意甚佳，小食攤以布傘接成連營，有雙流蔣麵，溫江荳花，有神仙湯圓，糖煮紅薯，以及蒼涼粉，糍粑等也都忙碌非常，大有「山陰道上應接不暇」之勢。</p>
<p>最近川大一部份學生，因檢查遊行學生而演出全武行，互相毆打，多人受傷，像這一類的事，都不免把成都的陰影描繪得更濃厚了。</p>
<p>成都呵：你到底要在什麽時候，才能變得真正的怡靜，安祥呢？（三·十五·）</p>
<h3 id="c100">伊朗：煤油之國 <a href="#c100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>伊朗，原名波斯，大部份爲高亢乾燥的高原，平均高度約四千呎。四周崇山圍繞，北部的山嶺高達一萬八千七百呎。南部和中部的氣候，炎熱難當，北部的氣候却又酷寒不堪。高原的溫度寒暑相關極鉅，有幾處地方冬季降至華氏三十二度，夏季却又升至華氏八十度。大部份地區雨量不到十吋，東北部爲二十吋，裏海沿岸一帶狹隘的平原，土地肥沃，則爲四十吋。波斯灣沿岸雨量尚足，可是炎熱的熱帶氣候，却很學過於衛生。中部和東部是一片廣漢的豐富砂礦。卡隆河是伊朗唯一的重要漂流，通過庫捷河丹的肥沃低地，而入波斯灣。</p>
<p>人民和物産</p>
<p>伊朗人口共計一千五百萬，其中約二三百萬人爲半游牧民族，此數正在逐步遞減中。其餘的多數住在小村鎮中，大部份在裏海附近的肥沃地區，或是西北的亞塞樂拜然省。在這兩區中，種植作物，可以毋給灌漑，但在高原中却不可能。主要作物爲麥·棉·糖·米·水果和鴉片。國外貿易是由政府專營的。世界着名的波斯毛毯爲主要工業品。其他巳開辦之工業，有紗廠·綢廠·　廠·烟廠·水泥廠。主要出品貨爲礦油。伊朗的産油量，平時佔世界第四。其他礦産，有煤·鐵·鋼·鉛·　·錳·鎳，可惜尚未大規模開採。</p>
<p>動盪的歷史</p>
<p>賽洛司大帝於二千五百年前建立波斯帝國，包括自印度至地中海，自高加索至印度洋的全部中東。波斯帝國於紀元前三三一年爲馬其頓王亞曆山大大帝所傾覆。此後，波斯的歷史就進入動盪階段。紀元六三六年受到亞刺伯人的侵略，十三世紀初受到蒙古人的侵略；一面爲斷地和羅馬人·匈奴人·土耳其人從事戰爭，一面還經曆着一次次的內亂。可是波斯人仍能保持着他們的民族特性和傳統，始終不變。</p>
<p>自十九世紀以來，波斯受到西文影響日甚一日，因爲她對於英俄法三國在戰略上都佔重要地位：對於英國，能藉以防守她的通達印度之路；對於俄國，能藉以保衛她的南部邊疆；對於法國，又是她想在東方擴充版圖所必備的條件。一九〇一年，波斯南部發現煤油，自此，波斯的地位就益顯重要了。</p>
<p>一九〇六年，應民衆的要求，波斯皇帝的專制政權告終，頒佈新憲法，設立上議院（半爲指定，半爲選舉）和下議院（每兩年選舉一次）。內閣總理李查汗於一九二五年大選中獲選爲皇帝，在他的統治下，曾努力發展運輸和灌溉事業。</p>
<p>一九四一年八月，英蘇兩國政府要求伊朗政府驅逐德僑出境。英蘇對於伊朗政府應付此事的態度認爲不滿，即於八月底出兵佔領伊朗。李查皇帝遜位，太子登基，驅逐軸心國人員出境。一九四一年九月伊朗對德義斷絕外交關係，一九四二年四月復對日絕交。一九四三年九月，伊朗對德宣戰。一九四二年一月英蘇曾和伊朗簽訂同盟條約，英蘇負責尊重伊朗的獨立和領土完整。一九四三年十二月德黑蘭宣言中，三國領袖宣佈「與伊朗政府一致，希望維持伊朗的獨立，及其主權和領土的完整。」</p>
<p>由於煤油的供應，尤其是戰略上的地位，伊朗對聯合國極關重要。她是保衛印度格中東的基地。她是輸送軍需品到蘇方去的戰略連絡站。公路和鐵路已經改良，由英美軍隊用以輸送租借物資，從波斯灣到蘇軍中去。（張德乾譯）</p>

<p>最近東北問題的嚴重化，引起全國國民的關切，世界人士也一致密切注視他的發展前途；見本問題巳不是單純的有關中國主權的問題，而是整個的影響世界和平的問題了。在這舉世屬目，全國情結緊張的關頭，蔣主席在二十五日中樞紀念周訓詞中保證東北問題必能命題解決，呼籲全國人民信任政府，不可要‘操切，並重申中蘇兩國友誼，必須保持，並須繼續增進；可因一時一事之現象，而動搖其努力。</p>
<p>蔣主席的訓示，不僅安定了普遍惶惑不安的心理，抑且闡明瞭必須保持和繼續增進中蘇友誼的一貫外交方針。我們除竭誠擁擠蔣主席的正確指示和完全信任政府，支持政府，以貫澈維護國家主權的目的外，仍願一本愛人以德的古訓，對蘇聯友邦的外交，與以廣泛的檢討而臻以誠意的忠告。</p>
<p>我們試一回顧歷史，當一九一八年第一次世界大戰結束以後，世界歸於共産狂瀾的冲激，在英國領導之下，組成了防共陣綫，蘇聯被各國所擯棄而孤立起來。這種政策就遭受後來遠見政治家的抨擊，因爲這是威脅着蘇聯的安全，而間接影響了未來的世界和平的。迨後情勢演變，在猜疑未能根除下，英法又把蘇聯拉進國際集團，直到一九三九年八月德蘇簽定互不侵犯條約止。中間蘇聯成爲擁擠國聯最爲忠實，倡導集體安全最爲熱烈的一國。尤其在一九三八年九月慕尼黑協定的前後，蘇聯的外交表現，博得舉世人士的好感；這又因爲他充分發揮了維護正義，信守條約的仁俠精神。就當德蘇互不侵犯條約的宣怖，雖然一時引起世人的震驚和不愉快的感覺，然而她不獲英，法諒解，三國談判失敗，以臻徬徨於民主和侵略（法西斯）兩陣綫之間，最後乃不得不出於聯德，以圖一國暫時安全的一番苦衷，世人又付以同情而加以原諒了。一九四二年六月，希特勒背棄條約，突然進攻蘇聯；這時蘇聯不僅變爲民主陣營的忠實盟友，並且舉世素來對她懷抱的猜疑心理，也爲之廓除盡淨。更由於她創造下史無前例的輝煌戰績，凡屬共患難同生死的盟邦，莫不寄予最崇高的欽敬。這一切都說明蘇聯在　國家的安全，躋世界於和平的真理方面，有着刻苦的努力和偉大的貢獻，而世界人類的追求真理，對那爲真理而努力的國家，是無不一致表示崇拜的。</p>
<p>蘇聯這段光榮歷史，實在啓示人類無限憧憬和無限希望，舉世殷切期待，在維護世界和平，創造人類幸福的艱鉅任務上，她將是最有力的堅強柱石。</p>
<p>不幸地，自從希特勒崩潰，日本無條件投降，以迄於今日，真理在蘇聯的外交表現上，竟逐漸演變而志爲神秘奧妙，高深莫測的一種玄機了。影響所及，乃使國際政壇上，一波未平，一波又起，令人眼花繚亂，深感不勝應付之苦，無怪英國外相貝文對她發出「攤開手中最後一張王牌」的迫切呼聲。蘇聯此種超真理的突變的外交作風，顯然造成愛好和平國家的普遍焦灼。由期待而失望，由崇拜而疑忌，世界的心理正在轉變着。我們爲蘇聯着想，該是萬分惋惜的。</p>

<h3 id="c104">中國電影之路 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— 紹萃</p>
<p>當一九三四年在納也納舉行世界電影集會的時候，奧國總統米克拉斯氏曾發表了一篇對電影的寳貴意見。他說：「我認爲電影是應該用來敎育指導群羣衆，而那純靠電影所表現的「究竟」其價値更應以敎育成份來估計衡　的。雖當影片在技術方面表現得如何的美好優良，他們絕不能違犯了對於人類神聖的觀念，而應該貢獻眞善美，避免一切　凟。不能違犯了科學與藝術，更不能離開人類與倫理的觀點。電影是學識的「傳給」，同時也是特殊的藝術。電影是混合着人類語言的旋律與音樂而表現於銀幕的。藝術永遠應該是高尙而自由的，換言之，那就是不違反倫理的觀念。它不能煽動汚穢，兇殘或罪惡。藝術是爲終日勞心與勞力的人類帶來快樂與希望，鼓舞他們向前向上的。假如每一位影片製作者能照這個目標而工作，他們對於人類自然有非常大的貢獻的。</p>
<p>米氏當時雖是對美國影界而發言，但他的意見實在是針對整個電影而發的。照他的見解，電影是應負有社會使命的。我們贊回米氏這種寳貴的意見，作爲「傳給」人類生活經騐的工具，比起作爲娛樂的工其其價値當然高超到難以計算。不過爲了「學習興趣」，而保留典趣的娛樂成分，也是必要的，但要明白這僅是求得敎育效能的一種手段，而不是電影的目的。</p>
<p>可是翻開世界各國出產的電影總且錄，固然符合朱氏所稱的影片也不在少數，但是大部份的影片還是逃不脫「拜金主義」的支配，爲了迎合特殊有閒階層的嗜好，變成純粹的娛樂消遣品。</p>
<p>從若干年以來整個中國電影市場來看，所輸入映演的外國影片，至少有百分八十以上的影片內容都是娛樂性質的，如果說含有敎育的意義也是屬於反面的。這幷不是說外國片商專把娛樂性質的影片輸入中國來麻醉煽惑中國人民，實在是爲了迎合一般中國觀衆低級心理的原故。在重慶的時候，曾有幾位外國公司片商向筆者說過，好萊塢製片者與發行人曾拿着中國市場營業統計表，發生過極驚嘆的疑間，因爲稍微意識嚴肅情趣高超一些的影片在中國都不能賣錢，能够受中國觀衆歡迎的反而是那些大腿，擁抱，歌舞，偵探，武打的五彩影片。他們爲了牟利，自然只好選排這類東西前來。反觀自己的製片成績，過去所有的國產片，論意識與藝術實在不忍深談。當抗戰期中，商營公司全部崩潰，國營製片機構因了受物質條件的限制，也沒有令人滿意的收穫。但是現在勝利了，中國電影事業已經走到新興發展的階段，國營製片機構已經開始拍片工作，商營的影片公司在不久將來也定會如雨後春筍般的興起。所以作者特別寫此短文提請我們的製片家的注意：電影是敎育的重要工具，它負有社會的使命！在中國，需要這種敎育意義的影片更是迫切。所以我們希望中國未來的新影片，在技術上要能够迎頭趕上歐美，在意識上絕不能逖犯了對於人類神聖的義務，避免一切褻瀆；不違反偷理，更不能煽動汚穢，兇殘或罪惡。相反地，我們期望負有社會使命作爲敎育工具的電影，藉了它偉大神聖的「傳給」，而把我們的醉生夢死的人們喚醒起來，把道德墮落倫理喪失的社會改善過來！更進一步把我們的國家民族從卑鄙窮困和紊亂中拯救出來！</p>
<h3 id="c105">票價問題 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— 霍克</p>
<p>現在的電影票價是高昂得不合理的，無論什麽東西若是在這半年餘內漲到一百多倍，都是不合理的。而電影票價是漲起了一百多倍了。</p>
<p>電影院老板利用上海人對於電影的愛好，瘋狂的加着價。像三級跳似的，自去年八月中頭輪票價的偽幣二千元起（合法幣十元），一直漲到了今日最低票價的一千四百元。我要再說一句，這是不合理的。頭輪一漲，二三輪跟着發動，而且漲得很兇，又促進了頭輪的再度「調整」。這樣屢次「調整」，循環不已，苦了的是一般普通觀衆｛</p>
<p>算算在這一時期中，米漲了幾倍？電費漲了幾倍？捐費漲了幾倍？一般物價漲了幾倍？其他開銷又漲了幾倍？我相信，平均不到五十倍的。而况現在觀衆比以前多出多少倍，只要看看「客滿牌」就知道了。</p>
<p>不過電影院老板是不管這些的。他在「一張票半斗米」的原則下，還感到不滿足吧！特地拿了「本院奉令自即日起代收娛樂捐百分之五十」的佈吿爲藉口，以轉移觀衆的耳目。很遺憾的，市府爲了貪圖較高的捐稅而忘記了電影爲一般人調劑精神及敎育的目的，批准漲價。而且漲得這樣利害！</p>
<p>我以爲，票價不應像現在那樣距離得近（以頭輪算是一千四，一千六，一千八）。而應該像戰前一樣，距離得相當遠，那就是說，最低票價應該盡量抑低，最高的票價不妨略高，戰前最高和最低的相差常達三四倍。現在呢，不過十份之一二吧了。這是太不成比例了，這一點非但能體卹一般普通觀衆，就是對戲院也是有利的，而不失娛樂爲大衆的目的。至於頭二輪，二三輪之問，也應隔開一相當的距離才好（以前是在一二倍以上的），也不容易刺激再漲。</p>
<p>其次在說明書方面，也不要這樣雜亂無章，往往貧乏之至的印了二三種所謂「特刋」，高價出賣，這是對觀衆的無形損失，戲院當局，應該自印一式化一頁或二頁的劇情說明，隨票附贈或至少照成本發售，像亞洲戲院以前就是很合理想的。某大報副刋每星期登了好多只開映電影的劇情說明，雖也是一個補救的辦法，不過終覺得不很好吧。</p>

<h3 id="c106">反攻緬甸瑯環 <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— 瑯環</p>
<p>這是一部以戰爭爲主題的影片。正和一班以戰爭爲主題的影片一樣，它多少免不了有些誇大的意味，但因爲演員盡責，穿揷適當，攝影的美妙，它仍不失爲一部値得推薦的片子。</p>
<p>序幕是史蒂威爾將軍誓復緬何的壯語，接着情遂在興奮的情緒中展開。駐在印度柬北部茶地的一隊美國傘兵，由納爾遜上尉（埃洛爾茀林飾）指揮，正在急盼出動時，得到了訓令，去冒險摧毁距日軍前綫後一百五十英里處，日軍的雷達基地。</p>
<p>傘兵五十餘人，由納爾遜上尉統率，一齊出動，一行人中有中尉賈可勃（威廉潑林斯飾），隨軍記者威廉（亨利霍爾飾），及中國連絡官李浩上尉等。抵達目的地後，納爾遜上尉用巧妙的戰略，炸毁了日軍的雷達基地。但全軍已陷入四面受敵的森林中，納爾遜上尉雖急率屬下趕赴預先指定的地點，候飛機援搭返防，但就在那時候，日軍大隊巡邏軍突至，傘兵遂被包圍。</p>
<p>納爾遜上尉分兵兩隊，另一隊由賈可勃中尉率領，的突圍後再集中取齊。納爾遜上尉的一隊雖歷險脫出，獲得空中接濟，而賈可勃率領的部隊竟因深人敵軍，被圍殉國。</p>
<p>納爾遜等因誤信賈等尙在，亟往援救，雖與賈獲得最後一面，但因日軍追擊，隊中死傷甚衆。</p>
<p>此後是飢渴的煎逼，疫病的侵害，日軍的追踪襲擊，威廉等因不堪困頓，都死在道中，而無錢電機被毀壞，更使全隊與大本營失去一切聯絡。但納等憑着不曲挽的勇氣，卒獲得接濟，更用巧妙的計略，殲滅大隊進迫的敵軍，而此時大隊的聯軍亦攻入緬甸，納爾遜率領着殘餘的十一名英雄，遂得重返基地。</p>
<p>在「反攻緬甸」一片中，埃洛爾茀林的演出可以說是很成功，他對軍人那種激昂沈毅的個性，都有相當深刻的模擬，尤其是和賈訣別，在山嶺上激勵部屬那幾幕中，可以看出。</p>
<p>劇情一直是在緊凑中發展着，跳傘時緊張的神情很逼真。山上殲敵一幕，鏡頭相當美觀，但最好的還是納爾遜回返基地時，遞交戰死部隊們證章時那黯然的神情，使人得到一些回味，覺得這至少不是一部純粹宣傳或胡鬧的影片。</p>
<p>日軍愚騃的神氣，形容得有些過火，但他們虐待俘虜，殘殺無辜的罪行，也許還描繪得不充分。</p>
<p>因爲這片的攝影監督是中國攝影師黄宗霑氏，看到片中美麗的畫面時，多少有一些得意的快慰。飾中國連絡官李浩上尉的唐佛蘭，雖覺呆板一些沒有表情，但並不减少觀衆對中國人出現影片中的興趣。</p>
<p>看了「反攻緬甸」後，因爲情景的相類，自然的聯想到史本塞屈賽主演的「百刦英雄」，但一個是滿含了侵略弱小民族的氣味，一個則表現了反抗殘暴，維護正義的思想。立塲的確是兩樣。「反攻緬甸」之所以得到觀衆的同情，原因也許在此。</p>

<p>「中製」裏的人物，獨多少壯派，打架，闖禍的事情時常發生，例如「焚燒本蘭從軍影片」「集體國攻某影院」事件，此係對外而言，內部自相摩擦拔拳相向，也屬常事，所以稱之爲「瘋人院」。</p>
<p>「中電」方面，多老氣横秋之輩，僻居南市，不聞不問，工作方面，則保持「但求無過不求有功」的刻板態度，人稱「養老院」，誰曰不宜？</p>
<p>位居北碚的「中敎」，最高主持人陳果夫氏，早年曾患肺疾，已故之副廠長余仲英氏，肺病允劇。且因該地環境幽靜空氣淸新，極宜於療養肺病，而「中敎」製片工作以十六糎小型片爲主，出品較遲緩，一若患肺病然。</p>
<p>如此三院，瘋人與養老兩院先後遷滬，療養院不日亦將遷京，但願之院遷地爲良，「瘋人院」裏的瘋人早日恢復常人狀態，「養老院」裏的老氣横秋之輩，一掃遲暮三氣；「療養院」裏的肺病患者也逐漸健康起來。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Foreign Minister Wang Reports to the Political Consultative Conference: Soviet Troops Will Be Completely Withdrawn by the End of April; Official Reply Received to Our Note <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, when attending the Political Consultative Conference this afternoon to give a foreign affairs report, stated: The Chinese government received on the 22nd a reply from Soviet Ambassador to China, Petrov, to the Chinese government's previous note of March 6th urging the immediate withdrawal of Soviet troops, which was</p>
<p>the official written reply. Petrov stated in the reply that Soviet troops are in the process of being withdrawn and declared that they will be completely withdrawn by the end of April at the latest. The government is currently considering a response to this reply.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 23rd] A second Changchun withdrawal, slightly different from the event of November 17th last year, is expected to be hastily completed tonight. However, personnel from the military delegation headed by Dong Yanping and personnel from the Changchun Municipal Government under Mayor Zhao Junmai are reportedly to remain stationed. The same applies to personnel from the various provincial governments that have been taken over, as their withdrawal would be interpreted by the Soviets as us voluntarily abandoning responsibility. The reasons for this withdrawal are that, on the one hand, the Soviets are posing as if they are about to informally withdraw, while on the other hand, they have notified Chinese officials that after the 23rd of this month, our air force personnel should immediately withdraw from the Changchun airport and are not allowed to continue using it. Thirdly, the Soviets are preventing us from transporting troops from Shenyang to Changchun via the Changchun Railway. Under these circumstances, if the Soviet troops suddenly withdraw from Changchun, it could become a "Siping Second." Therefore, officials are withdrawing unnecessary stationed personnel. Today is the last day of the Changchun withdrawal. The city of Beiping was filled with the rumbling of aircraft engines from dawn to dusk. The government seems to be using all available aircraft to transport back non-essential stationed personnel. In recent days, family members of the chairmen of various northeastern provinces stationed in Beiping have frequently petitioned the Northeast Headquarters to send them back to their husbands quickly, so as not to become another Zhang Xinfu. A public memorial service for Li Zhaolin will be held in Harbin on the 24th. The Communist army requested to participate. After negotiations, they decided to send 180 representatives into the city, but Mayor Yang is responsible for their safety. However, Yang's security team has already been disarmed by the Soviet army, as have the police. No one dares to predict what the situation will be at that time.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Chongqing, 23rd] Foreign Minister Wang stated at the Political Consultative Conference today that a written report on the negotiations with the Soviet Union regarding the Northeast issue will be submitted to the Conference. According to government sources, the scope of the Soviet troop withdrawal in the Northeast may not include Dalian, where the Soviet Union has stationed a large number of troops. In addition, the Sino-Soviet Treaty stipulates that Soviet troops are stationed in Lushun, which is also unlikely to be included in the withdrawal.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Soviet Troops Continue to Withdraw from Changchun; A Batch of Our Receiving Personnel Returns to Jinzhou <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 22nd] Today, eight aircraft transported a large number of receiving personnel. However, on the other side of the fact of transporting receiving personnel is the continued withdrawal of Soviet troops, giving rise to rumors, soaring food prices (rice was less than ten yuan per catty at the beginning of the month, but is now selling for seventeen yuan), and public anxiety. This morning, this reporter accompanied receiving personnel who were taking a plane back to Jinzhou to the airport, which slightly relieved the boredom of being cooped up in the city for several months. The snow in the city had melted early, but the countryside was still covered in thick snow. This reporter witnessed several large buildings along the way that had previously been Soviet barracks, but are now desolate and dilapidated. When the truck approached the airport, there was a misunderstanding with the Allied guards on duty, who strictly inspected the personnel on board. After requesting the presence of a liaison officer, they were allowed to pass without hindrance. To date, there are still many receiving personnel in the Manchu Coal Building, but the previous four meals a day have been reduced to two, and the building is not as noisy as it used to be.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 23rd] Amidst the talk of Soviet troop withdrawal, there are currently several contradictory phenomena occurring. One of the most prominent of these phenomena is that the number of Soviet aircraft has increased in recent days compared to before.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Harbin, 22nd] The atmosphere in Harbin is still very tense. The city's perimeter is currently guarded by Soviet troops, who are prohibiting armed Communist forces from infiltrating the city. However, it is reported that as of the 21st, there were approximately 5,000 Communist troops who infiltrated the city.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Shenyang, 23rd] Shenyang currently has a population of two million Chinese, Japanese, and Soviet residents. The area is now completely guarded by National troops. Shenyang Mayor Dong Wenqi recently ordered a door-to-door search, which may be the reason why the city is gradually becoming more peaceful. It is rumored that Communist troops are currently 30 to 90 li away from Shenyang and are retreating. National troops are advancing to the east, south, and north. According to Chinese military sources, Sun Liren's New First Army has arrived in Tieling and is advancing towards Siping Street. A portion of the National Army's 52nd Army has entered Fushun, and the New Sixth Army has also occupied Liaoyang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 23rd] In the plains area between Liaoyang and Yingkou, an unidentified armed force of nearly 100,000 has gathered in the past week. The leaders and cadres mostly speak Shandong and northern Jiangsu dialects. Most of the weapons they use are made in Japan and include a large number of mortars.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Communist Army Demands Partially Accommodated; Jinpu Railway Repairs Continue; Eastern Section of Longhai Railway to Be Completed Soon <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 23rd] The issue of repairing the Jinpu Railway lines has been resolved. The Railway Bureau's repair team will dispatch personnel in the coming days to lead teams to damaged sections to continue repairs. It is reported that during the negotiations, the Communist army in the Shandong area demanded that the executive group recognize the Communist army's organized transportation agencies and district management. The group partially accommodated this request, allowing workers and technicians from the Communist army engaged in repairs during the repair period to be paid by the government. The rest is to be discussed later.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 22nd] Order in Tai'an is gradually stabilizing. People are able to trade freely. The National and Communist sides have agreed that no personnel are allowed to mix in. Although a small number of Eighth Route Army grain personnel carrying work permits and legal tender were found to be purchasing goods from the area, the overall situation is still good.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 23rd] The eastern section of the Longhai Railway is being actively repaired. On the 22nd, repairs reached the 86-kilometer mark at Daxujia and Bayi Group. In addition to this, the most severely damaged section east of Xuzhou is still 5 kilometers long. Beyond this 5 kilometers, the damage to the railway line is lighter. The tracks from the Yunhe Station to Baitabu, a distance of 94 kilometers, are still in good condition. Only the 237 kilometers between Baitabu and Hetu need to be repaired. The Railway Bureau had planned to start repairs westward from Haizhou, but was rejected by the Communist army. The eastern section of the Longhai Railway from Xuzhou to Lianyungang is 223 kilometers long, of which 78 kilometers were damaged. 20 kilometers have now been repaired, and the remaining 58 kilometers can be completed in the short term if there are no obstacles. The northern section of the Jinpu Railway has now been repaired to 621 kilometers north of Hanzhuang, and is still 19 kilometers from Lincheng. The 24th Transportation Group is still supervising repairs in Hanzhuang.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 22nd] Qingdao News: The Communist army in various parts of Jiaodong has arbitrarily renamed Jimo County to Jixi County and divided Yashi County into Yaqian County, Yahou County, and Wulong County, appointing local officials and undermining the unity of government orders. The Communist army has also set up checkpoints on major transportation routes to forcibly collect donations and taxes, placing the people in dire straits. In Shandong Province, which is occupied by the Communist army, approximately 85% of the people are displaced and young people have lost their homes and schools, forming the most serious problem in Shandong Province today. According to related estimates, over 60% of middle school students have dropped out of school, and over 80% of elementary school students have dropped out of school. There are only 51 middle schools currently open in Shandong Province, and Jinan City accounts for two-thirds of them.</p>

<p>Zhang Zhizhong Postpones Trip to Dihua</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] Regarding the dispatch of a military mediation executive group to the Northeast, the Military Tripartite Group meeting passed the principles on the eve of General Marshall's return to the United States on the 11th of this month. However, the specific plans and practical methods for implementation after arriving in the Northeast still need to be agreed upon. It was originally planned that there would be results before the 20th of this month, so that Zhang Zhizhong could fly from Chongqing to Dihua on the 21st. However, regarding the issue of sending an executive group to the Northeast, after many meetings and individual discussions between Zhang and CCP representative Zhou Enlai and General Gillem, no agreement had been reached by the 20th. Zhou flew to Yan'an on the 21st to ask for instructions. Minister Zhang had to postpone his trip to Dihua for a few days to wait for Zhou to return to Chongqing and continue the meeting, hoping to reach an agreement.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 23rd] A tragic case of a Communist army shooting and killing a student recently occurred in Tai'an. On the 10th of this month, Fan Weishun, a student at Tai'an Yuying Middle School, was on his way home from school when he passed a Communist army post at the station. The Communist army asked for the password, and he replied that he was a Yuying student. The guard immediately opened fire, and the student fell to the ground with a serious injury to his right arm.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, [Missing date] 23rd] On the morning of the 22nd, the questioning of President Song at the Political Consultative Conference reached its climax. Compared to the questioning of former President Kong by previous Political Consultative Conferences, the atmosphere of anger and enthusiasm at the venue was even more intense. Compared to the questioning of Song at the Second Plenary Session, the sounds of the cannons this time were enough to drown it out. Huang Yuren, after hearing President Song's political report, said that the current political phenomenon suffers from two diseases: one is pushing, the other is falsifying, and the third is chaos.

The number of people listening in suddenly increased today. The General Assembly Secretariat issued 30 listener passes yesterday. Gu Weijun and Wu Tiecheng both attended the meeting. After the chairman announced the opening of the meeting and the secretariat reported, Shao Lizi spoke first and reported on the Political Consultative Conference. It was originally planned that Sun Ke Zu would give this report, but today Sun was in Beibei on official business, so Shao attended instead. Shao has spared no effort to promote domestic unity and the Political Consultative Conference, and is therefore extremely familiar with the progress of the Political Consultative Conference. He briefly explained (1) before the Political Consultative Conference (i.e., the reasons for convening the Political Consultative Conference), (2) the progress of the meeting, and (3) the situation after the Political Consultative Conference. After the speech, Zhang Qun reported on the cessation of military conflict, resumption of transportation, army reorganization, and unified organization of the Communist army plan, describing the three negotiation processes separately, and specially pointed out that the government has always negotiated with the Communist army in the spirit of national forbearance, in order to realize peaceful unification as much as possible, so that the people can recuperate and the country can engage in peaceful construction. The report ended at 10:30 AM. After a ten-minute break, the meeting continued with written and oral inquiries, totaling 51. Councilors all expressed great concern about the degree to which the Political Consultative Conference's resolutions and the restoration of transportation and reorganization of the army have been implemented, and listed facts of the Communist army disregarding cease-fire orders and wantonly harassing the people, offering many impassioned statements. Finally, Shao Lizi gave simple answers to questions about the legal status, representation, and guarantees of implementation of the Political Consultative Conference.

Zhang Qun, in discussing the cessation of conflict agreement, stated that the government would make extreme concessions to achieve peace and unity. He stated that General Marshall's original purpose in coming to China was to assist China in fulfilling its obligations to the United Nations and to promote Sino-US cooperation in the work of repatriating Japanese residents, but due to changes in the situation, Marshall had to deal with domestic issues in addition to resolving China's diplomatic issues. Zhang also stated that when the current US Ambassador to China, Hurley, was in office, his original suggestion for the nationalization of the army was that the ratio of Kuomintang and Communist armies was 7 to 1. The Communist army requested a ratio of 6 to 1, and the final agreement reached was a ratio of 5 to 1. Zhang revealed that the resolution on the nationalization of the army was established after seven meetings. This agreement was based entirely on Marshall's recommendations, not on the recommendations of either the Kuomintang or the Communist army.</p>

<p>Testimony of Soviet Embassy Telegraph Operator</p>
<p>[Reuters, Toronto, 23rd dispatch] Igor Gouzenko, a cipher clerk at the Soviet Embassy in Canada, testified in court yesterday in the case of Canadian Member of Parliament Ross Kane for supplying secret information to the Soviet Union, admitting that the Soviet security police are active in Canada. He said that he followed Colonel Zabotin and Colonel Ramonov, Soviet military attachés to Canada in 1943. Zabotin set up a military attaché office. The Soviet Union has its own intelligence system in Canada, searching for information beneficial to the Soviet Union. Two diplomatic couriers travel twice a month to the Soviet Union by ship with mail and packages. The Soviet Union also has a spy network, using the Communist Party of Canada as a base of operations. All of this can be proven.</p>

<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd dispatch] The White House announced that President Truman stated tonight that the atomic bomb test on the warships at Bikini Atoll will be postponed by six weeks, to July 1st. The original plan was to conduct the first test on May 15th, detonating an atomic bomb in mid-air, and the second test on July 1st, detonating an atomic bomb on the surface of the water. This postponement is because many members of Congress expressed a desire to observe the test, but they will not have time to travel to observe on the original date due to their busy parliamentary schedules.</p>

<h3 id="e38">Rectifying the Term "Minority Nationalities" and Discussing China's Border Issues <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiyun</p>
<p>The term "minority nationalities" did not originally exist in China. It is a translation from Western languages. The author is not very clear about who used this term first. After World War I, Dr. Bowman, an authority on political geography in the United States, wrote a book entitled "The New World After the War" (I. Bowman: New World, published in 1921), which was translated into Chinese by the author and friends and published by the Commercial Press. We once translated the English word "Minority" as "minority nationalities." Scholars in China seem to have failed to examine the similarities and differences carefully, often using the term "minority nationalities" as a general term for the various ethnic groups in our border regions, turning it into a very common term. In fact, the national conditions of China and foreign countries are very different. We should be cautious about all terms, carefully examining their meaning and reality. If we adopt them casually, various difficulties will inevitably arise.</p>
<p>What is meant by "minority nationalities"? Let's take an example first. Czechoslovakia is a country in Central Europe with a population of over 14 million, of which 2 million are of German ethnicity. These Germans share the same language and culture as the 70 million Germans, and due to language, religion, and historical ties, they have a strong emotional connection to Germany, implicitly recognizing Germany as their homeland. Therefore, the Germans within Czechoslovakia are referred to as "minority nationalities" not only in relation to Czechoslovakia but also in relation to Germany. The difference between Europe and China is that China has been a unified country since the Qin and Han dynasties, while Europe has not been unified since the decline of Rome. It is like the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods in China, with various powers vying for dominance, the map changing colors, and the ethnic boundaries and national borders not coinciding. This situation is particularly evident in Eastern Europe. Therefore, the issue of minority nationalities is a very serious political problem in Europe. Scholars call it a "conflict zone," and if not handled properly, it can lead to internal strife and external aggression. After World War I, the League of Nations advocated the conclusion of minority treaties, with each relevant country guaranteeing their implementation, precisely because of this.</p>
<p>China's situation is completely different. The territory of the Chinese nation and the geographical distribution of the Chinese nation are largely consistent. China is adjacent to the Soviet Union and India, but there are no areas in China where Slavs and Indians are mixed. Therefore, the term "minority nationalities" cannot be applied in China. The Chinese nation is a large family, with the Han nationality being like the eldest son, and the Manchu, Hui, Tibetan, and other ethnic groups being like brothers and sisters. Over the past two thousand years, there have been countless migrations, mixtures, and intermarriages. Although the languages, beliefs, lifestyles, and customs of the various ethnic groups are different, there is no strict distinction in bloodlines. For example, the Manchus are also known as the Banner People. We know that the Banner People in the early Qing Dynasty included the Han Army Banners and the Mongolian Banners. Even the Manchus themselves have undergone numerous migrations, incorporating various components of the Bohai, Khitan, Jurchen, Goryeo, and Han people of Liaodong in the Ming Dynasty. Where is there a so-called pure Jurchen descendant? The same can be said of other ethnic groups such as the Mongols, Hui, and Tibetans, as well as their various branches. Anyone who has read Chinese history should have the same feeling.</p>
<p>What forces ultimately shape a nation? Language is not the main factor. For example, part of Canada speaks English and part speaks French, without harming its status as a thriving nation. Religion is not the main factor either. For example, northern Belgium, near the Netherlands, adheres to Protestantism, while southern Belgium, near France, adheres to Catholicism. Lifestyles and customs are even less important. As the ancients said, "Different customs prevail in broad valleys and great rivers, and different customs exist among those who live there." The larger the territory, the more complex its economic situation. The main forces that shape a nation are nothing other than a common history, common memories, common commemorations, and a common spirit. For example, the United States can be called a new Europe. Immigrants from various European countries are present. In Europe, their ancestors were originally hostile to each other, but upon reaching the New World, their descendants are able to unite sincerely. This is due to the American spirit permeating the country. The origin of the American spirit lies in the common memories of the War of Independence, the Civil War, and the two World Wars, as well as the common commemoration of great figures such as Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and Wilson. Therefore, the establishment of a nation is not only due to geography but also due to history. The History of Yuan is a part of Chinese official history. Genghis Khan is not only a great figure of the Mongol ethnicity but also a national hero of the entire Chinese nation. Tsongkhapa is also owned by the entire nation.</p>
<p>The history of the Chinese nation is a history of joys and sorrows, sharing weal and woe. The Han, Manchu, Mongol, Tibetan, and Hui ethnic groups are like the five fingers of a hand, with the blood of the Chinese nation flowing together. The Han ethnicity can be compared to the thumb, the historical center of activity. If we have internal problems, that is a matter for our family, and we can discuss and resolve them ourselves without waiting for others to step in and help. If one finger is cut off by external force, the entire hand will suffer and bleed continuously. This is called national consciousness and the great cause of unity. Scholars in ancient times often used the term "border barbarians" to refer to several branches of our nation. In modern terms, it means several groups of descendants living in the border areas. This is originally a very correct concept. Therefore, we should follow the old saying and call them "border ethnic groups" or simply "border people." The term "minority nationalities" originated from abroad and is fundamentally unacceptable.</p>
<p>Understanding this principle, we know that the word "minority nationalities" should absolutely not be included in the Constitution. Even if we take a step back and stipulate special treatment for border ethnic groups in the Constitution, thereby losing the generosity of treating everyone equally, it is also completely unnecessary. The Constitution is different from general laws. The Constitution should focus on the national ideology and the political system created based on that ideology. As for general policies, they often need to be adapted to the times and local conditions, and it is enough to stipulate them in ordinary laws. For example, coastal residents make a living by fishing. The Constitution does not need to establish a separate article to protect coastal fishing grounds. The dialects in Fujian and Guangdong are diverse, including Fuzhou dialect, Guangzhou dialect, and the like. The Constitution cannot have explicit provisions to maintain such dialects. The situation is the same for the sea borders and the continental borders. The author believes that there should be no discrimination between the herders of the Central Asian plateau and the coastal fishermen, and there is no significant difference between the languages of the Mongol and Tibetan ethnic groups and the dialects of Fujian and Guangdong. As for religious freedom, it is the inherent right of citizens, and the various ethnic groups in the border areas are no exception.</p>
<p>Based on this, the policies that should be implemented for the various ethnic groups in the border areas in the future are clear and beyond doubt. Nationalism must not be abandoned. We currently do not see any better organization than the nation-state as a unit of the new world. The responsibility of politicians is to create centripetal force for the country, not to ask them to go against the grain and create centrifugal force for the country. Local dialects should not be prohibited, nor can they be prohibited, but the national language and the country's history and geography are essential for every citizen to learn. The livelihoods of the various ethnic groups in the border areas still largely rely on nomadic life or a semi-agricultural, semi-pastoral state. This is certainly due to the influence of the geographical environment, but production methods and transportation conditions are also important. As a result, their standard of living is far lower than that of the southeastern coastal areas. There is no reason to let them suffer hardship without improving their situation. "Using industry to promote agriculture (including forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries) and using agriculture to support industry" should be universally implemented throughout the country. As for local autonomy, it is a major principle for establishing a country, but the border areas cannot have so-called high degree of autonomy, which is different from the provinces in the interior. The United States wants to turn Alaska into a new province. The United States originally had forty-eight provinces, and thereafter there will be forty-nine provinces. This is the principle. The Founding Father said that all ethnic groups in the country are equal. This is truly a guiding principle for nation-building. Since all are equal, there is no need for special treatment other than adapting to the environment.</p>
<p>The author absolutely dares not ignore the interests of the border people, nor does he shy away from the fact that there have been civil uprisings in the border areas in the past. Several rebellions in the Qing Dynasty once made the northwestern provinces restless. However, the government's handling policy should be no different from dealing with civil uprisings in the interior. Zuo Zongtang's saying, "Distinguish between the good and the bad, regardless of Han or Hui," is sufficient to illustrate the traditional spirit of the Chinese nation. Strengthening the centripetal force of the border people lies in eliminating corruption, improving officialdom, and regarding the careful selection of county magistrates and the renewal of county administration as the true foundation for nation-building. This is also a national reform, not limited to the border areas. In short, the border issues of China today are fraught with crises. The reason for this is not from within but from external erosion. The Xinjiang issue and the Mongolian issue, which are enough to shake the foundation of the country, did not occur during the Anti-Japanese War but after the restoration of peace. The reason for this is highly noteworthy. Conversely, if China and India can coexist peacefully, Tibet will certainly be safe. In the 33rd year of the Republic of China, Commander Huang Zhengqing of Labrang Monastery represented the Tibetan compatriots in Chongqing and donated funds to purchase 30 aircraft. Is this not clear evidence of the Tibetan people's inclination towards the interior? Knowing that China's border issues are not internal but external, we must recognize the facts, distinguish right from wrong, and first have a nationally consistent public opinion. Then the government's diplomatic negotiations can have a firm and unwavering position.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the League of Nations' treaty to protect minority nationalities is based on President Wilson's principle of national self-determination. It sounds very appealing on the surface, but in reality, it is inevitable that many difficulties will arise. Within a country, the division between minority nationalities is just as the ancients said, "Those who are not of our race will surely have different hearts." Having divided a piece of land to be ruled by a certain country, there are also treaties to protect the people of that place, resulting in various restrictions on the implementation of the country's policies. These minority nationalities are neither completely nationals nor completely foreigners. The people are constantly harboring different ambitions, and the government is often at a loss. The issue of minority nationalities is one of the important factors that led to World War II. Therefore, scholars have often criticized the improper application of President Wilson's principle of national self-determination. As for the plebiscites held under the occupation of foreign troops, forcibly digging them out of the embrace of the motherland and glorifying it as national self-determination, how is this any different from a treaty signed under duress? The author is unwilling to say more.</p>
<p>Someone may ask, "Is it true that China has no minority nationalities problem?" The answer is, it seems there is. That is, the Korean farmers scattered in the Northeast, whose number is close to a million, referred to simply as the Korean farmer problem. The seriousness of the situation has exceeded the ordinary foreign resident problem and is somewhat similar to the minority nationalities problem. Since Korea gained independence and seceded from China, it has suffered various oppressions from Japan. A portion of the farmers crossed the border to migrate and cultivate land and plant rice in our Liaoning and Jilin provinces, which is to be pitied. However, Japan used the Korean farmers as its vanguard for aggression. They often did not accept the rule of local county governments but were directed by the Japanese consulates. Chinese farmers were sometimes bullied by the Korean farmers. In the Yanbian area of Jilin (the so-called Gando by the Japanese), a situation of the guest surpassing the host was created, which is very heartbreaking. Before the September 18th Incident, the Northeast was the most troublesome place in China's diplomacy. Immediately before the Shenyang Incident, there was the Wanbaoshan Incident, which was caused by Korean farmers in the countryside of Changchun hindering water conservancy and clashing with Chinese farmers. At the same time, Japan incited anti-Chinese sentiment in Korea. At that time, the author went to Changchun, Wanbaoshan, and Sinuiju in Korea to conduct on-the-spot investigations and deeply felt the seriousness of the situation. The air was depressing, with the feeling that a storm was about to break. I had just returned to Nanjing for a month when the Shenyang Incident suddenly broke out. Czechoslovakia became the trigger for the European side of World War II because of the minority nationalities problem. In this regard, there is a similar situation in the Far East. This time, the Czechs, having regained their homeland, learned from their pain and advocated expelling the two million Germans within the country because they had taken actions that endangered the motherland during the war and felt that this was the only way to deal with minority nationalities. The Chinese nation has always been compassionate, merciful, and magnanimous. For the Korean farmers in the Northeast, we should negotiate with the Korean government, allowing those who wish to move back to Korea to do so and those who wish to naturalize to do so. We should treat them equally with other foreign residents, but there is no fundamental discussion of self-governance for minority nationalities.</p>
<p>Zuo Zongtang once said, "Protecting Xinjiang protects Mongolia." The principle of lips being cold when the teeth are lost is an eternal truth. If Mongolia is not protected, then the Northeast is also in danger. If Xinjiang and Mongolia are lost one after another, the Great Wall area will immediately become a border fortress, and the provinces in the Central Plains will have no peaceful days. The disaster of national subjugation is imminent. The so-called territorial integrity and sovereign independence should include the entire Republic of China. How can we call it integrity if our mountains and rivers are broken? Whether Mongol, Hui, or Tibetan, they are all Chinese, part of the 400 million compatriots. They are definitely not Slavs or Indians within China. The ancients once said, "One word can ruin a country." The author sincerely hopes that the term "minority nationalities" will no longer be heard in the council chambers or seen in newspapers. Moreover, in the future, public opinion organs should issue a declaration on the border issue, righteously and forcefully announcing it to the world, so that foreigners will no longer be able to distort the facts and have an excuse. This is truly the supreme blessing of the country and the infinite fortune of the nation.</p>

<p>The fishing season is approaching this year. The County Fishermen's Association has recently petitioned the Ministry of Finance to establish a fishing salt yard in Hupu Port to facilitate transportation and sales. Hupu Port is a place for the transportation and sale of saltwater fisheries. Every year during the spring and summer, fishing boats export to the Yellow Sea to fish. There is no place to replenish fishing salt along the way, which affects production. Before the war, approval was granted to establish a salt yard, but the war broke out, and it was not established.</p>

<p>Details of the Exhumation of Buried Foreign Nationals</p>
<p>Regarding the tragedy of the enemy military police stationed in Songjiang burying foreign nationals alive, General Commander He of the Army was reported and ordered an investigation. The Songjiang Prosecutor's Office exhumed a skeleton. It is now known that the live burial of the victimized foreign nationals took place in the winter of the 32nd year (of the Republic of China), when the enemy military police stationed in Songjiang and the enemy garrison used rickshaws to transport them to Fangta Square, where they dug a pool and buried them alive. When the foreign nationals were escorted, enemy troops guarded the area, not allowing the public to watch. However, upon passing by, it was seen that those being escorted all had blue eyes and blond hair, clearly not domestic people. As for the nationality of these foreign nationals and why they were arrested and harmed, it is difficult to ascertain. The skeleton exhumed on the afternoon of the 21st had the left hand and five fingers incomplete, and the teeth were scattered in the mud, caused by being buried and then suppressed with huge rocks. The exhumation was scheduled to continue on the 22nd, but it was temporarily suspended due to rain. The nationality of the victimized foreign nationals will have to wait until the excavation is completed before identification.</p>

<h3 id="e42">The Enemy and Puppet Industry Management Bureau Temporarily Unable to Conclude Operations: Shanghai Section Until February 20th - Received Materials Exceeding 10 Billion [Units of Currency] - Military Supplies, Illicit Gains, and Undecided Materials Not Included <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Enemy and Puppet Industry Management Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui has been established for nearly five months. The actual value of the materials received has garnered considerable attention from various sectors. Yesterday, this reporter received information from Mr. Shen Shanhong, Secretary of the Bureau, regarding these figures for the Shanghai section up to February 20th of this year. However, the materials from locations outside Shanghai have not been completely tallied and thus cannot be released. The breakdown of these figures is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Materials (including warehoused goods, seized goods, German merchant company assets, trading company assets, and pharmaceuticals, etc.): 298.3 billion [Units of Currency]; (2) Factories (including factory buildings): 154.6 billion [Units of Currency]; (3) Real estate and furniture: 58.3 billion [Units of Currency]; (4) Docks and warehouses: 33.8 billion [Units of Currency]; (5) Gold, silver, currency, and securities: 30.4 billion [Units of Currency]; (6) Educational and cultural institutions: 11.7 billion [Units of Currency]; (7) Ships: 9.3 billion [Units of Currency]; (8) Farms and fisheries: 4.6 billion [Units of Currency]; (9) Food and perishable goods: 2.6 billion [Units of Currency]; (10) Fuel: 1.1 billion [Units of Currency]; (11) Military vehicles: 2 billion [Units of Currency].</p>
<p>The total sum above is over 600.7 billion [Units of Currency]. This valuation is based on Shanghai market prices as of the end of December of the 34th year [1945]. If estimated at current market prices, it would be over 1 trillion [Units of Currency]. Furthermore, all military supplies, illicit gains, and suspected materials for which a verdict has not been reached are not included.</p>

<p>Regarding the disposition of traitor property after their death, according to the original order from the Executive Yuan, it could be confiscated. However, a recent order from the Judicial Yuan states that it cannot be confiscated. Therefore, the Bureau has telegraphed the Executive Yuan, Judicial Yuan, and Legislative Yuan, requesting a joint determination of a method. Furthermore, whether the children of traitors can inherit this property is also not clearly stipulated. Therefore, current laws seem insufficient. Once new methods are decided, this can be resolved. The Bureau is currently conducting investigations into this property, followed by receiving and inventorying it. The Bureau is responsible for or entrusts its safekeeping but will not handle it for now. For example, the children of suspected traitors can still reside in their former residences. The Bureau will only handle it after the court makes a definite ruling.</p>
<p>Liquidation Accounts Extremely Cumbersome</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Bureau's establishment, the Executive Yuan originally instructed that the disposal of enemy and puppet property should be completed within three months. However, due to practical difficulties, an extension was granted. Therefore, it has been nearly five months. Observing the current situation, matters regarding property disputes and material disposal should conclude within three months. However, the handling of illicit gains must await court judgments, and it is feared that the court's trials of traitors will still take considerable time. Furthermore, regarding the liquidation section, the accounts are extremely cumbersome and time-consuming. Therefore, although the Bureau has gradually reduced its scope and dismissed some employees, it is expected that the illicit gains and liquidation sections cannot be concluded soon.</p>
<p>Restructured Into Three Groups</p>
<p>Currently, the Bureau's internal organization, after restructuring last month, is divided into thirteen groups: The first group is responsible for handling and utilizing various materials, including houses, factories, warehouses, and the sale of affordable goods, etc. Currently, for houses that the Bureau has decided to dispose of, the Bureau affixes a seal and hands them over to the Central Trust Bureau for safekeeping. Whether the furniture inside the house is sold is also determined by the Trust Bureau. The second group is responsible for evaluation and appraisal. The third group is responsible for handling property disputes. The Bureau's deliberative body, the Real Estate Utilization Committee, holds a meeting once a week. Many institutions request the Bureau to allocate houses, which are then decided by this committee.</p>
<p>Returning Automobiles Based on Numbers</p>
<p>Because Western newspapers have criticized the matter of returning automobiles, this reporter specifically inquired with Mr. Shen. According to his response, within eight years, Shanghai residents lost 2,000 automobiles, and the Bureau has returned less than 100 [of them]. The other automobiles have not been returned not because the Bureau is making things difficult, but because their original owners have already disappeared. Car owners currently applying to the Bureau for the return of their vehicles only need to report the original engine number of the car. The Bureau will check with the Public Works Bureau, as there are records of this number when car licenses were applied for before the war. Fortunately, the Public Works Bureau managed to preserve all of this material. Recently, when applying for car licenses from the Public Works Bureau, many were detained by the Bureau. These "black cars" are due to problems with the engine numbers. The Enemy and Puppet Industry Management Bureau has exerted its full effort to return items to their original owners. Furthermore, if car owners discover their car lost during the war in any location, as long as the engine number matches, no matter who currently occupies the car, the Bureau will definitely not show favoritism and will recover and return it.</p>
<p>Several Water and Electricity Companies Returned</p>
<p>[Another Report] Regarding the handling of sealed materials in Chinese merchant warehouses, the Deliberative Committee for the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Industries recently made supplementary decisions: If merchants and civilians purchased and stored goods in the names of others during the period of enemy and puppet occupation due to environmental circumstances, but were unrelated to the enemy and puppets, with a written guarantee from a reputable shop or trade association provided by the owner, the sealed goods will be returned. Furthermore, yesterday the Deliberative Committee approved the return of five ships, as well as the return of the Shanghai Zhabei Water and Electricity Company water plant, the Shanghai Inland Water Company, the Shanghai British Water Company, the Pudong Water Company, and the Anqing Power Plant. The Pudong Water Company was recovered by the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the Anqing Power Plant was recovered by the Resources Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Central Bank Convenes Important Meeting to Discuss Cotton Import Settlement <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>According to reliable sources: Yesterday morning around 10:00 AM, the Central Bank convened a meeting at its headquarters with cotton importers, yarn factory representatives, and representatives of designated banks. Those present included President Pei Tsu-yi, Ministry of Finance Advisor Dr. Young, Head of the Foreign Exchange Examination Office Lin Weiying, Director of the Business Bureau Lin Fengbao, and others, to discuss cotton import settlement matters. The results were as follows: Most cotton importers, factories, and relevant designated banks have failed to fully comply with the new foreign exchange regulations for cotton import settlement, apparently due to a lack of understanding of the regulations. The Central Bank, recognizing the urgent need for cotton in the country, has approved the provision of foreign exchange for a portion of the cotton price for those who have already settled foreign exchange, provided that the situation permits. The other part of the cotton price should be corrected within a reasonable time to avoid losses to the parties concerned. Regarding cotton that has already been shipped and ordered but not yet sold, the Central Bank, after a comprehensive plan following this meeting, believes that a large amount of cotton will arrive soon, sufficient to meet the market demand for several months. Before the supply and demand situation in the market is fully understood in the future, it is specially recommended that cotton merchants and manufacturers be particularly cautious when making new transactions to avoid the adverse phenomenon of cargo accumulation and congestion at Shanghai docks.</p>

<p>Unreservedly Admits to Serving in Puppet Positions</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Mao Renyu, 47 years old, from Wujiang, Jiangsu, Deputy Director of the Issuing Bureau of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank and concurrently Director of the Issuing Section of the Shanghai Branch, was reported by the Inspection and Statistics Bureau. The High Prosecutor's Office charged that during the period of occupation, the Central Reserve Bank was the financial institution controlling the entire occupied area, and the Issuing Section of the Shanghai Branch promoted puppet currency, absorbed legal tender, and arbitrarily expanded and contracted, resulting in frequent shortages of cash and premium increases for discounts. Its damage to the people's livelihood was extremely evident. As Deputy Director of the Bureau, Mao's responsibilities were extremely important, and therefore a public prosecution was filed. At 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the High Court Criminal Division reopened the public trial. Mao unreservedly admitted to serving as Deputy Director of the Issuing Bureau of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank and concurrently Director of the Issuing Section of the Shanghai Branch from May of the 31st year [1942] until the victory of the War of Resistance. However, he argued that the positions of Deputy Director and Director of the Issuing Section were merely nominal. The power to issue counterfeit currency was in the hands of the traitor Zhou Fohai, the president of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank, and he vehemently denied any close relationship with Zhou. Mao's lawyer argued on his behalf against the accusation that he had accumulated a large amount of wealth and purchased a Swiss-style house, stating that this house was not purchased with wealth accumulated while in office. Furthermore, he stated that if Mao Jingren was truly disloyal, why would he still be employed by the Liquidation Office of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank after Shanghai's recovery. After the arguments were completed, sentencing was scheduled for March 30th.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since arriving in Shanghai on the 30th of this month, "Injured Saint" Wang Changxi has been in contact with various military and government agencies to negotiate matters related to propaganda in this city, and preparations are now in place. Yesterday, he hosted a reception at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA to entertain the press of this city, recounting the details of his seven years of travel to various provinces. Wang lost his eyesight and was crippled in both legs during the Battle of Taierzhuang in the spring of the 27th year of the Republic [1938]. Unable to participate in combat, he engaged in anti-Japanese propaganda after many difficulties, traveling to half of the country, a journey of more than 41,000 miles, raising 48 million [Units of Currency], and founding three charity schools in Hengyang, Baoji, and Quanzhou to accommodate the children of anti-Japanese soldiers. Wang is from Tangyi, Shandong, and lost his parents at a young age. He joined the army at the age of sixteen. Feeling the pain of illiteracy, he emulated Wu Xun, striving to raise funds to establish schools. He was imprisoned six times due to misunderstandings. However, he continued to deliver inspirational speeches to major universities and colleges, and comfort wounded soldiers' hospitals, never shirking his hard work, day after day for seven years, gradually earning the respect of the whole country and being hailed as the "Injured Saint." After arriving in Shanghai, with the assistance of the Social Bureau, he will deliver speeches in theaters in rotation every night starting from the 26th, and speak in factories during the day. He will also hold an exhibition in the near future, displaying more than 400 photographs and documents from the places he has traveled over the years.

<p>Sawada Shigeru, former commander of the Japanese 13th Army, Tatsuta Sotojiro, former director of the Jiangwan Concentration Camp, and Wakou Yusei and Oka Kazutaka, former Japanese military court judges, are being tried for the sixth time yesterday for the crime of murdering airmen belonging to General Doolittle's command. Witnesses who were summoned included Suzuki, a former soldier who served in the 13th Army, and guards who served in the concentration camp, all of whom specified that three airmen were indeed killed by the Japanese. The lawyer Zong Guan, hired by Sawada Shigeru and others, is somewhat talented, and the questions he raised focused on whether the defendants had the authority to order the execution of American airmen. First Lieutenant Weiba, of the US Military Missing Persons Search Office, was also summoned to court. He found the tombstones of the victims in the Shanghai International Crematorium at the end of this year, with the names of the three men engraved on them, as well as the date of their death. Finally, Mr. Stert, the owner of the International Funeral Home, was summoned to court. Stert collected the ashes of the deceased after they were burned in October 1942, and sealed them in small wooden boxes, which he presented in court as ironclad evidence. At that time, Mrs. Homer, the wife of one of the victims, also attended the hearing with Nelson, filled with grief. Afterwards, the presiding officer requested the audience to leave the court due to confidential issues that needed to be discussed. The case is scheduled to be retried tomorrow morning.</p>

<h3 id="e57">City Divided into Seven Districts for Collection of Property Tax <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Collection Not Yet Started in South and East Shanghai</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The method for collecting property tax in this city, as stipulated by the Bureau of Finance, has already begun in January with the collection of winter property tax and will soon be completed. The collection method involves dividing the city into seven districts, each conducting its collection separately. The Real Estate Valuation Section of the bureau will estimate the value of each property based on the prices in the 26th year of the Republic [1937], add sixty times that amount, and then collect fourteen percent of this figure annually as property tax. All funds will be collected on behalf of the Shanghai Municipal Bank. To date, except for the South and East Shanghai districts, where the valuations have not yet been determined and collection has not yet begun, the amounts collected in other districts are as follows: Central District, over 65 million yuan; West Shanghai District, over 67 million yuan; Madang District, over 63 million yuan (the above three districts have collected 80 percent). North Shanghai District, over 29 million yuan; Hongkou District, over 27 million yuan (the above two districts have collected 50 percent). The method for exempting military and government agencies from tax is currently under discussion. Since U.S. troops pay rent for their housing here, their own property tax will be exempted, and only half of the tax, i.e., the tax that the landlord should pay, will be collected. It is said that the spring property tax may be slightly increased to subsidize the cost of uniforms for the Home Guard.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Military Tribunal has been interrogating prisoners in recent days, but the investigation of their crimes and the gathering of witnesses and evidence will take some time, and a public prosecution and trial may not be possible in the short term.

Furthermore, each person has submitted a written statement and is awaiting summons to testify about the facts of their victimization.</p>

If citizens contract epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, they should immediately seek medical attention and receive penicillin or 大健凰 injections, and should not take folk remedies, as this could endanger their lives.</p>

<p>The Kader Bathhouse on Kader Road in this city was established by Xie Baosheng. After the victory [of the war], it was taken over by the Enemy and Puppet Assets Administration Bureau, which treated the workers quite well, so no disputes or accidents ever occurred. Since last month, when Xie's son contracted to operate the bathhouse, he has become increasingly harsh towards the internal staff. The workers have repeatedly requested improved treatment from the labor union, but after four attempts by the union to mediate, all were rejected, leading to the anger of all the workers in the bathhouse. Therefore, starting yesterday afternoon, they all provided service and treated bathers as usual, but did not collect any money.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Optimistic Prospects for Sino-U.S. Trade: Remarks by Former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, Welcoming the Revision of the New Company Law <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] This reporter recently visited Mr. Fessenden, the former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council and now a famous American lawyer, to obtain his views on the revision of the new company law. Mr. Fessenden stated: "I am extremely pleased to learn that the Chinese government has decided to revise the new company law to avoid discriminating against American companies in China. As a result, all existing American companies in China will be able to continue operating. The changes in the registered capital and directors of each company will only be known after the revised company law is officially promulgated and implemented." Mr. Fessenden further explained: "This revision of the new company law is more significant for the United States than for the United Kingdom. All American companies in China under the U.S. China Trade Act are prohibited from operating in the United States, while British companies operate under the trade laws promulgated by the British government in Hong Kong. Nineteen of them have headquarters and branch offices established in Hong Kong. Therefore, if the new company law were not revised, American companies in China would not be able to continue operating, while British companies in China would not be affected in any way." Mr. Fessenden continued: "Since the United States abandoned extraterritoriality in China in 1943, it was agreed at the time that a new Sino-U.S. commercial and friendship treaty would be concluded within six months after the cessation of hostilities and the signing of a treaty. Now that the new company law has been decided to be revised, it is expected that the treaty can be drafted and completed in the short term. Once implemented, trade between China and the United States can be expected to recover and become more prosperous. He remains optimistic about the future of China and Shanghai and predicts that once transportation is restored and currency values stabilize, the future prosperity will be limitless. He himself has lived in China for over twenty years and deeply believes that the people of our country are very rational. Therefore, after the U.S. side raised the issue of the new company law, it was corrected in a reasonable manner."</p>

<p>Yesterday's gold market was erratic. It briefly improved in the morning, but only temporarily. It opened slightly higher at 1.59 million, and after opening, it retreated to around 1.56 million. After entering [the market], the Guangdong brokers and securities brokers entered slightly, and it was pulled up immediately. The Central Bank's [配給] rationed gold was below 1.59 million, the market price was lower than the rationed price, so no one registered to receive the ration. After 11:00, the actual sales were slightly strong, and because the industry had not received rations today, the market price exceeded the Central Bank's rationed price and reached a high price of 1.62 million. There were still many old stocks that were settled at high prices. At noon, it was at 1.59 million. The situation was stable in the afternoon after an initial decline. As a result, it was recovered by 45,000 compared with the previous close. Gold ornaments are listed at 174,000, silver at 1,600, silver dollars at 1,000, and the dark discounts are stable. Interest rates range from 1.6 to 2 jiao. People's hearts have revealed prosperity, and people place high concern on the Central Bank's allocated price next week.</p>
<p>The sales of US dollars are stable. The market opened at 1,960 yuan with a slight supply. After entering, it gradually improved, hovering around 1,965 yuan. As a result, the previous close rose slightly by 15 yuan. Old Hong Kong dollar spot prices were slightly softer due to the constraints of telegraphic transfers. As a result, it returned by a small amount of 5 yuan. Buyers of new goods are still strong. However, after many consecutive days of gains, it is easy to release out old stocks at high prices. Although it rose, it traded at a high price with lots of stock. However, in the afternoon, foreign exchange speculators still heard the news and continued to purchase quite hard. The close was also at a high price. Compared with the previous close, the spot prices of 1936 and 1937 also rose by another 25 yuan and 20 yuan, respectively. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were 435 yuan, and rubies were 535 yuan, all with transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Guangdong Brokers Collect Spot Yarn, Cotton Transactions Are Scarce, Cloth Factories Ordered to Increase Production <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market was stable, and the high-end goods of 20 counts, such as the Golden Rooster, Dafa, and Double Horse brands, were still favored by Guangdong brokers, so the price was particularly high, rising by 230,000. Other 20-count brands also rose by more than 10,000 yuan. The 16-count and double-thread were very ordinary. People's hearts are still stable. Yesterday, the Spinning and Construction Company regularly opened for sale for 23 types, including serge, woolen fabrics, blankets, and 海力司. Cotton yarn will be opened for sale next Monday.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York American cotton continued to rise by 3 to 9 pounds. The spot price of American gold in the near term was 26.93, the spot price in the long term was 26.89, and the spot price of 米特林 was 27.53. The local spot cotton market situation was flat and tired, and the transaction was almost at a standstill. The amount that the United States lent to China could purchase 300,000 packages of raw cotton, so people were looking to the small side and mostly adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Only ordinary 米特林 was traded by brokers at a stock exchange price of 75,000. The negotiation between the Spinning and Construction Company and various private yarn factories was not carried out, and the transaction was very scarce.</p>
<p>Recently, various private textile factories have made more profits from spinning yarn, so they regard weaving cloth as a difficult task, because it only increases labor costs, and profits are weakened. In view of this, the China Textile Construction Company believed that it was not smooth enough to have cotton cloth supplied by itself, so it specifically informed various private textile factories that they must supply cotton cloth and immediately open for sale. Factories such as Shenxin and Wing On are actively stepping up production for sale in the market.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Silk Steady but Tired <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's silk market was steady but tired, and the market was calm. Only rayon opened harder than the previous day. 120 Tianqiao at 1.65 million yuan, and then rose to 1.73 million yuan at the close. The market was very good in the afternoon, and there was a transaction at 1.74 million yuan. 120 half-gloss rose to 2 million yuan, and people were still searching for it. The offer price for high-quality 5-dan 洋行 goods of factory silk was 2.45 million yuan per dan, and transactions for other dan and 干经 were very rare. Silk goods continue to show a trend of fatigue. Yesterday, the market price of American Asia 被面 was 1.15 million yuan per 100 strips, the price of Dachen fabric was 3,860 yuan per yard, and the transaction price of semi-factory electric spun goods was 45,000 yuan per piece.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of this month, the actual sales of tinplate had once stagnated. Many expected it would be difficult to improve in the short term. However, the sluggishness did not last long, and it became active again. This is because the more kerosene arrives, the greater the need for tinplate. The two are closely related and inseparable. With smooth sales, market prices are also good. Currently, 200-pound "Bian Lian" tinplate sells for 280,000 yuan per box, 200-pound "Hui Si Yi" sells for 260,000 yuan per box, and 112-pound kerosene can blanks sell for 150,000 yuan per box. Due to new arrivals, the price of strip tinplate has not improved, ranging from 112,000-130,000 yuan to over 200,000 yuan per box.</p>

<p>Yesterday, rice continued to arrive in the market, with average sales. Both Japonica and Indica rice showed a weakening trend, with lower grades seeing little demand and few transactions. White rice was discounted by 1,000 yuan. Flour, with strong demand from Wenzhou and Ningbo, saw demand exceeding supply, rising another 400-500 yuan. Soybeans, on the other hand, gradually declined, with the central region falling another 200-300 yuan, with few transactions. Raw peanuts remained firm, sesame was stable, soybean cakes showed a slight weakness, wheat bran was unremarkable, cotton cakes were temporarily stable, and corn fell slightly by 100 yuan, with weak demand. In the oil market, with arrivals from Qingdao, Kaifeng, Bengbu, Xuzhou, and other places, soybean oil fell by 1,000 yuan and refined oil fell by 2,000 yuan. Crude oil weakened early but stabilized in the afternoon. Except for flour, which rose, the prices of other grains were generally stable or declining.</p>

<p>Actual Sales are Slow, Sellers Feel Anxious</p>
<p>The coal market, especially for lump and powdered bituminous coal, heard that the allocation price was increased to 175,000 yuan per ton, delivered at the Pudong wharf. This caused the market price to stop falling and turn firm, and once shouted higher. Fortunately, actual sales were slow, and the price returned to the previous level with little change. There was still demand for screened lump white coal, but sellers still felt anxious and wanted to sell out at high prices, so the price continued to fluctuate slightly. Actual sales of powdered white coal were average, and the market showed little fluctuation.</p>

<p>Yesterday, government bonds were affected by "Sun's notes," causing a slight buying surge. The opening price of Class C bonds rose slightly to over 1,800 yuan, and was briefly pushed up to 2,100 yuan. In the afternoon, it declined slightly to 1,920 yuan, up 15% from the previous close. After the close, activity among market participants pushed the price of Class C bonds to over 2,100 yuan. Shanghai stocks were popular as soon as they opened yesterday. However, the popular stocks mostly fluctuated, mainly because market participants did not have much inventory, and all the chips flowed into the hands of the Sichuan gang. As soon as there were buyers, the asking price increased. Operators abandoned popular stocks and tended to collect small stocks and various old stocks. The Commercial Press was shouted up to 140,000 yuan per share, Huacheng Tobacco to 29,000 yuan, and Shanghai Cement to 50,000 yuan, with more buyers than sellers. Before noon, popular stocks such as Wing On Textile had risen to 5,000 yuan, Mayer &amp; Feibel to 4,000 yuan, and King Fook to over 375 yuan, but later fell slightly. The afternoon close was about 10% higher than the previous close, while unpopular small stocks rose more than 20%. In the afternoon, the asking prices of the three popular stocks decreased by half a percent, while the three smaller popular stocks, such as King Fook, weakened even further. Foreign stocks were still popular when they opened, with Ewo Yarns once rising to over 10,000 yuan, before many investors locked in profits and the price slightly declined in the afternoon. The result was about 5% higher than the previous close.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Clarifying Doubts About the Case of Remaining Cloth and Yarn After the Robbery <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Shihao</p>
<p>The three associations of dyeing, weaving, cotton cloth, and yarn industries applied to the relevant authorities to return the remaining cloth and yarn transferred by the Enemy and Puppet Industry Disposal Bureau from the received Puppet Cotton Association.</p>
<p>After several twists and turns, it is heard that the Industry Review Committee will consider the matter. This is truly a question that should be seriously considered by the relevant authorities. We do not want to talk about legal principles here, because according to legal principles, the property previously seized by the enemy should be investigated and returned by the authorities. This is not only what legal principles dictate, but also what is clearly stipulated in the principles for dealing with enemy property. The cloth and yarn were forcibly purchased at a low price by the enemy puppets in August 1943, with the price being less than a quarter of the market price at the time. A quarter of the payment has not been received. The forced occupation, the fact that more than a quarter of the cloth and yarn was forcibly occupied without compensation, is real and must not be concealed. The Industry Review Committee will surely have a fair and reasonable solution to resolve this dispute. However, there is something that we cannot help but say. Some people may think that this application for return is an action by the three associations themselves, and the damaged cloth and yarn factories did not have this intention. This is contrary to the facts. It must be reiterated that during the war of resistance, the damaged factories had already made secret preparations. After the victory of the war of resistance, countless members urged the responsible persons of the association in writing or orally to strive for the return from the government, and many had already filled out the power of attorney.</p>
<p>Entrusting the Association to Strive for Return</p>
<p>Advertisements were published, seeking help from President Chiang and all sectors of society. A few days ago, the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association held a general meeting of members, and the first resolution was to urge the responsible persons of the association to seriously handle this case. The Cotton Cloth Industry Association and the Yarn Industry Association will hold general meetings of members on the 24th and 26th of this month, and a large number of members have already jointly submitted proposals asking the association to intensify its efforts. The facts are there, and the responsible persons of the association cannot fabricate them. Considering the deep suffering and current difficulties of the cloth and yarn factories, saying that they can ignore the occupied cloth and yarn is against human nature. Some say that although the price paid for the forced purchase was low, gold was distributed in return. Given the rise in gold prices, the victims should have been compensated. We should ask those who say this to carefully calculate the price of cloth and yarn and gold at the time, and then calculate the black market price of gold and the black market price of cloth and yarn when the gold was delayed.</p>
<p>Gold Cannot Fully Compensate for Losses</p>
<p>The booklet "My Views on the Remaining Amount of Cloth and Yarn Forcibly Purchased by the Enemy and Puppet Should be Returned" has a clear calculation, pointing out that the gold issued by the enemy puppets, calculated at the black market exchange rate each time it was issued, plus the banknotes they issued, the actual price received by the damaged factories was only 29% of the market price of cloth and yarn at the time. The original text is clear and there is no forced interpretation.</p>
<p>Others say that the country is still in difficulty, the government's finances are difficult, and the income from enemy and puppet property will be a source for national construction and making up for the finances. Merchants should be considerate. We believe that although the finances are tight, the authorities may not adopt this policy.</p>
<p>The Cloth and Yarn Received by the Puppet Cotton Association are Purely Chinese Cloth and Yarn</p>
<p>There is no enemy or puppet cloth and yarn in it. When the enemy puppets forcibly purchased it, they set up another organization to control the cloth and yarn of enemy merchants, which the Puppet Cotton Association was not involved in. If the cloth and yarn of Chinese people that was forcibly occupied by the enemy and puppets is regarded as enemy property, it is not the original intention of the government and does not comply with the principles for dealing with enemy property. Financial difficulties can be solved by clearly increasing taxes or soliciting donations from industry and commerce. How can we allow confusion and ambiguity, and lose the fairness of legal principles? Even if we take a step back, if the authorities need cloth and yarn for military needs, they can clearly purchase it from all owners at a fair price. Cloth and yarn factories have never been behind others in assisting in national construction and will not have different opinions. How can we forcibly confiscate it and be suspected of plunder?</p>
<p>The reception of enemy property has changed hands several times, and the methods have changed. A part of the cloth and yarn transferred by the Puppet Cotton Association has been sold in transit, and a part has been transferred to other uses. This may also be a pending issue, but as far as my humble opinion is concerned,</p>
<p>Sold Items Can be Investigated</p>
<p>The price can be returned, and the calculation is not difficult. For those that have been transferred to other uses, as long as the use is legitimate, it can be settled at a fair price. It is also possible to persuade the damaged factories to make a clear donation. There is no need to worry about it. The cloth and yarn factories have suffered under the iron hooves of the enemy puppets for a long time. Now it is a great fortune to see the light of day again. If they can be persuaded with reason and compensated for their losses, in my personal opinion, it should be negotiable. Readers should know that in addition to the losses of the yarn factories that may have been compensated, the dyeing and weaving factories and cloth and yarn shops in the entire city are looking forward to a reasonable handling of this case. It is hoped that the government authorities will not focus solely on financial revenue, and the damaged factories will not delve too deeply into legal matters, then wouldn't harmony and prosperity be great?</p>

(2) Now that the schools in the association have begun teaching inactivity, how should the solution be chosen in the future? Please submit the discussion proposal. Resolution: Direct negotiation with the bureau.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Soviet Union Hurls a String of Bombs at Our Country; Terrifying Storm in the Northeast; What is the Reason for Peeling Our Skin, Strangling Our Throat, and Severing Our Lifeline? <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— This Newspaper Beiping, 22nd Dispatch by Special Correspondent Zhang Jianmei</p>
<p>The flames of war are spreading in the Northeast. The matter of Yan [馬歇爾] military mediation group's work extending to the Northeast seems to require a considerable amount of time to be realized. This is because the mission of the group sent to the Northeast to execute it has not yet been settled. It is said that Zhou Enlai has proposed two methods for this problem: one is that the mission of the execution group in the Northeast is to investigate, and then the execution department or the three-person meeting will resolve it based on the investigation situation; the other method is that the three parties should first seek a solution principle for the military and political problems in the Northeast, and then send a group to execute it. It is generally judged that if Marshall returns to China recently, it will accelerate the solution of the Northeast problem. At present, the chaos in the Northeast is progressing with time. After the fall of Siping Street, the situation in Harbin and Changchun is also extremely tense. The Soviet troops in these two places may suddenly withdraw, just like in Siping Street, but the military authorities have also made some arrangements for this.</p>
<p>Countries Have Already Compromised to the Utmost; The Soviet Union Gets Everything it Asks For</p>
<p>The commander of the communist army besieging Siping Street this time was Lu Zhengcao, who advanced in four routes from Liaoyuan, Changgang, Bamiancheng, and Lijie. The communist party's command in the Northeast has been unified recently. The military is commanded by Lin Biao, who is the only communist army with mechanized units for combat, and the politics is in charge of Zhou Binzhong.</p>
<p>Countries have already done their utmost to compromise with the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union's diplomatic gains can be said to be getting everything it asks for, and it can be complacent. However, all kinds of diplomatic blitz tactics, all kinds of unexpected demands, a string of bombs, are still being thrown out incessantly, causing the post-war world, which could have been peaceful, to fall into a terrifying storm again. The Soviet Union obviously cannot shirk its responsibility. Moreover, what is the difference between the demand for land (from Turkey), the demand for privileges (from China), and the tsarist Russia? What is the difference between inciting autonomy and independence and dividing the territory of other countries (in Iran and China) and Hitler? What is the difference between coercing by force, and breaking treaties (with China), and the ferocious face of imperialism? Why can the British army stationed in Greece with the consent of the Greek government under the current situation in the United Nations not be withdrawn, while the Soviet army in the Northeast can arbitrarily violate the regulations and delay the withdrawal? Why can they blame the British army for suppressing the autonomy movement in Indonesia, while in China they can incite the border ethnic groups, who originally had no problems, to forcibly divide the territory and harm the integrity of China's sovereignty? These gestures and these methods not only show their unlimited security demands (which naturally hinder the security of other countries), but also threaten world peace, which is obviously an illegal act beyond the norm.</p>
<p>The Focus of Suspicion Among Countries Will Isolate the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Let's just talk about China. The China of the Three Principles of the People has never threatened any country in the past, and will never invade any country in the future. This is because we have the superior conditions of self-sufficiency, and we naturally cultivate the national spirit of loving peace and being friendly to our neighbors. Our only requirement and task is to maintain the integrity of our territory and safeguard the independence of our sovereignty. After this great disaster, we should work hard to restore and build the country, and we want to cooperate sincerely with our great Soviet ally to jointly promote the peace and happiness of mankind. What reason does the Soviet Union have to not be at ease, already peeling its skin (Outer Mongolia), and wanting to strangle its throat (Xinjiang), and even sever its lifeline (the Northeast)?</p>
<p>The reason why we take the trouble to review the Soviet Union's diplomacy during and after the war is still based on the heart of a Bodhisattva, hoping that the Soviet Union will cherish its past glory and not let it disappear easily. Isn't it? The Northeast problem is serious, but isn't the situation between Canada, the Soviet Union and the United States, and the Huangpu River and the Soviet Union, also tense? If a country's situation becomes the focus of suspicion among countries, it is a sign of approaching isolation, and isolation is definitely not a blessing for a country. After the First World War, the Soviet Union's isolation was external, unreasonable, and unreasonable. If the Soviet Union falls into isolation again after the Second World War, it will be self-inflicted and difficult to win the sympathy of the world. The fact is very clear that the future destiny of the world depends on whether the five powers can cooperate. Among the five powers, the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, even if there are still a few problems that cannot be solved in time, the so-called few problems are relatively simple, the four powers' love for peace is relatively sincere, and the diplomatic attitude is relatively open, so there is no room for excessive pessimism in the future. Moreover, the four powers, while feeling the "hide-and-seek" trouble with the Soviet Union's real needs and its diplomatic methods, all have the sincerity to compromise and maintain peace. Therefore, the key to reversing the situation lies only in the hands of the Soviet Union. The Northeast problem is a link in the chain of world unrest caused by Soviet diplomacy. We not only expect the Soviet Union to immediately rein in at the brink of the precipice and make a wise, far-sighted, and essential solution; but also hope that the Soviet Union will re-evaluate its current diplomatic strategy from a global perspective based on general principles. Not to mention the style of the Tsarist era, even the strategic direction of the Soviet Union before the sensitive international dissolution must not be reused. It is imperative that all suspicions disappear and we ascend to the realm of cooperation and happiness together, wouldn't that be "Oh, how grand!"?</p>
<p>Turning calamity into blessing depends on a single thought, and the fate of all mankind in the future, whether to ascend to heaven or enter hell, will also be determined by this one turn. We believe that our great ally—the Soviet Union—will surely know what to choose.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Impersonating the Eighth Route Army Concentrated in the Northeast and Active <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— This Newspaper Changchun, 20th Dispatch by Special Correspondent Yue Ning</p>
<p>When the national army entered Shenyang, the people here seemed to suddenly step into spring from the cold winter. Although there are still gusts of cold wind blowing to chill people's hearts here and now, everyone believes that the haze that has been covering the sky in the past will gradually be blown away by the gentle wind. Because the Soviet army has indeed withdrawn from Shenyang on time, the US Consul General Stark has arrived in Dalian and is engaged in establishing the US Consulate, and the Soviet Union has replied to the US relevant note on the Northeast. Although the content has not been announced, this symbolizes that the ominous Far East situation has tended to ease. Moreover, Marshall, who is running for peace in China, is returning to the United States, which is generally considered to be very meaningful. All of this is enough to show that the diplomacy of the Northeast may enter the right track as a result.</p>
<p>However, there are still some hidden worries that make people feel particularly uneasy at the moment. There are still some obstacles to the takeover of the Northeast. That is, the personnel of the two provincial governments of Heilongjiang and Hejiang have been stranded in Harbin for a long time and cannot go to Bei'an and Jiamusi to take over. And today, Yang Zuoren, a member of the military delegation, has gone north to Harbin to take care of the return of personnel from the two provinces to Changchun. These two provinces were accompanied by Soviet liaison officers to Harbin one month and eighteen days ago. After arriving in Harbin, the Soviet side only told them that the local area was not peaceful and could not go there, so they stayed. Unexpectedly, there is now a saying that "the new government of Heilongjiang has been established," saying that it was established in November last year. If this time is correct, then it has been more than four months since today, and "the establishment of the new government" and "the local area is not peaceful" obviously cannot be "unified." The takeover of Heilongjiang Province is hindered by this, and Hejiang Province should be in the same situation. Reports say that Jilin also has news of the formation of a provincial government, with Zhou Baozhong as the "chairman." Zhou Baozhong's detailed experience is unknown. Only facts are pointed out. When Liu Juying took over the Changchun municipal government on November 14 last year, he claimed to be a yellow lieutenant colonel in a certain country's military uniform, and appeared in the city police station, recruiting troops and buying horses on a large scale, but now he has taken off a certain country's military uniform and changed into a "chairman." Furthermore, Gu Ding (originally named Xu Changji), a writer who praised "Japanese-Manchu cooperation" during the puppet Manchukuo period, claimed to be the "recruitment committee chairman" in Kuanchengzi here in November last year. Anyone who can call up a company of people is a company commander, and anyone who can call up a battalion is a battalion commander. Now he is also employed as Jilin's "People's Education Commissar." There should be a large number of people who have risen up and used force to seek official positions. These two people are active in Changchun sometimes, so people can tell why. The Eighth Route Army in the Northeast is extremely complex, and some classify them as foreign Eighth Route Army (those who fled abroad and returned after August 15), local Eighth Route Army (relative to the foreign Eighth Route Army), big Eighth Route Army (those with higher status), small Eighth Route Army, true Eighth Route Army (Yan'an system), fake Eighth Route Army, acorn flour Eighth Route Army (composed of locals, because they ate acorn flour during the puppet Manchukuo period), and rice Eighth Route Army (those who came from inside the customs, they thought that people inside the customs all ate rice). Since last winter, they have been trying their best to expand. Taking the China Chang Railway as an example, those who go to Dalian from Shenyang for inspection, those who come to Changchun from Shenyang, check on the railway, and those who go from Changchun to Harbin are all checked. All the places of inspection are places where they gather. Whenever the train arrives at their place, in addition to inspection, they shout to see if there are any "central takeover personnel." If they are found, the consequences are not difficult to imagine. However, the situation is different if there are Soviet liaison officers on the train. Liaobei Province went to take over on January 8. The province of Siping has always been under the control of the Eighth Route Army. Recently, plague was discovered in Siping, and the Soviet army in the area completely withdrew after the Soviet army in Shenyang. This happened on the night of the 13th. It is difficult to make a judgment on the situation in Siping at present, but it is only known that the county magistrate of Kaiyuan County in the province was captured by the Eighth Route Army, and the county magistrate of Changtu County has already withdrawn. As for Tie , Liaoning Province, according to transportation sources, the telegraph bureau there is now occupied by the Eighth Route Army, and the long-distance telephone in Shenyang is quite obstructed.</p>
<p>Looking at the overall situation, the haze will certainly be blown away, but these many difficult problems remain to be solved. However, these kinds of difficult problems are easy to solve, and the solution will never make people feel suffocated.</p>
<p>Chongqing Dispatch: The unification movement of the communist army in the Northeast has been slightly effective under the planning of Lin Biao, Nie Rongzhen, and Lu Zhengcao, the three communist army leaders. Yang Jingyu and Gao Yi, the foreign troops of the communist army in the Northeast, have partially changed their flags, but their strength is extremely weak. Zhang Xueshi's troops around Fushun believe that they are the orthodox People's Army, and their number still appears and disappears from time to time. The communist army in the Northeast currently needs huge military expenses. In order to facilitate the absorption of the miscellaneous troops in the Northeast, it is opening up financial resources by various "centrifugal" methods. The Beiping special dispatch published in today's Nanjing Evening News said that the communist army has openly transported opium from outside the customs to sell in Pingjin and other places.</p>
<p>Twelve Soviet economic, electrical, and industrial representatives from Shenyang, reportedly from Changchun, recently visited Mayor Dong, hoping that the factories and industries currently guarded by the police would be handed over to them for start-up and other processing. Dong declined politely, telling them that the Soviet side could not use them before the municipal government received government orders. When the Soviet army withdrew, it handed over 41 factories, warehouses, and houses to the municipal government for safekeeping. According to the Soviet side, the industries were purchased by the Far East Trade Bureau, the Far East Bank Transportation Bureau, and Qiulin Foreign Company. However, according to our investigation, most of them are enemy and puppet industries, so Mayor Dong has submitted a request to the government for verification.</p>

<p>The future development of the nine provinces of the Northeast lies in promoting heavy industry and the chemical industry, making it the base for industrialization of the entire Asia. There are at least three tasks: one is to develop the original industrial base, the second is to develop the industrial resources in the future, and the third is to adapt to the urgent needs of heavy industry. Under this realistic situation, our authorities have established a Northeast industrial policy in order to achieve epoch-making progress.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Peaceful "Little Beiping" The Spring of Chengdu <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— This Newspaper Chengdu, 15th Dispatch by Air, Sent by Qingfeng</p>
<p>Chengdu—This only basin in Sichuan, which is praised as "Little Beiping," as long as you have been there, you will always have a deep affection for it. If you have never been there, then you will definitely feel more longing and infinite sadness.</p>
<p>It is the capital of Sichuan Province and the capital of the Han Dynasty of the Three Kingdoms. It is more than 40 kilometers around the city and is boundless. In Shu, which is full of mountains throughout the province, you will naturally feel the loveliness of this city. There are quite a few historical sites and scenic spots, such as the Zhuge Wuhou Temple, the Du Gongbu Thatched Cottage, the Wangjiang Tower, and the Xue Well...etc. Others, such as the Liu Xiang tomb built in modern times, are huge in scale and meticulously designed, but they are also quite magnificent and well-woven. The above-mentioned places are also very crowded with tourists and very lively. Since the Five Jian Tomb was excavated in the 30th year, it has made Chengdu even more antique, and the houses in Shao City, the classic gates, the three- or four-courtyard bungalows, the spacious courtyards, and the garden equipment all resemble the old capital. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, enemy planes continued to bomb, which caused huge losses to the citizens of Rong in terms of spirit and materials, but invisibly helped the prosperity of the market. Take Citang Street as an example: the road is wide and the city appearance is new, which cannot but be said to be the "gift" of bombing. The spring of Chengdu is said to be the most beautiful and lovely, but because the reporter came and went in a hurry, he inevitably rushed through and was exhausted. Now, I will just briefly describe what I have seen:</p>
<h3 id="e97">The Largest Speculative Market is Located in a Dilapidated Temple <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>When it comes to Anle Temple, I am afraid everyone knows it, because it is the largest speculative market in Chengdu and the only speculative market in western Sichuan. It is located in the center of the city. It is said to be the temple of Liu Chan, the Duke of Anle of the Han Dynasty, so its reputation is quite loud, not less than that of Chengdu. However, if you want to see it, then you will definitely not believe it, because such a famous largest speculative market in western Sichuan—a place where several tens of millions or more transactions are made every day—is such a shabby and dilapidated temple, with only an old and not very large hall, and dozens of tables. The tables are full of tea drinkers, and the gaps between the tea drinkers and the back are surrounded by people, either talking loudly about the market or talking softly about transactions. Recently, because of the sharp rise in gold notes in Jin and Shanghai and the recovery of department stores, Anle Temple, which has been quiet for two months, has become active again. At about 9:00 in the morning, hundreds of private chartered cars are lined up outside the temple, and the temple is crowded with people, including bank managers, local gentry, daughters of wealthy families, and rich concubines. In short, they are all friends who have money and leisure. They all want to speculate, they all want to get rich, and they all want to become the second Black Widow. This is the nickname of a capable woman. She is a widow with very dark skin. At first, she was just a cigarette stall owner at the gate of Anle Temple. Later, she earned a little money, so she ran to Anle Temple. At that time, happened to be lucky and department stores followed suit, and she earned one or two tens of millions in half a year, so the name of "Black Widow" became famous. In social occasions and large banquets, such a noble woman was also added. However, there are also poor little brokers who run errands specifically for food.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Lavish Praise for the "Touching Sleeves" Custom - A Den of Sin <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The custom of "touching sleeves" is very prevalent here. Most people extend their hands into the sleeves of others, using three or two fingers to indicate numbers. Even between men and women, it's very common. No one feels there's a difference between the sexes or that giving and receiving should be avoided. I've seen many noble ladies willing to let their powdered hands be touched repeatedly by the coarse, sweat-stained, yellowed-by-smoke hands of others. Because everyone is vying for "profit," they feel it's okay to let others take advantage, as long as they can earn more money.</p>
<p>In front of the hall, there's a large open space with many stalls, the stronghold of Western medicine and cigarette paper businesses. They hold up their fingers and shout prices, rarely "touching sleeves." In the entrance passage, however, the sound of money is loud. Since the "shifting of battlegrounds" of the gold market, this place has become much less attractive.</p>
<p>This place can truly be called a den of sin. Although many have made fortunes here, many have also fallen. It was probably right after the victory! Many who frequented Anle Temple were overwhelmed by the plummeting prices of goods and gold notes, driven to desperation, and could only commit suicide or take poison. But before long, people gathered at Anle Temple again. Speculators! You should be more vigilant and avoid repeating the same mistakes!</p>
<h3 id="e99">Chengdu's Cultural Heart - Busy and Restless, No Longer Peaceful <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Huaxi Dam—this is the cultural heart of Chengdu and also the concentration of higher education institutions. Jinling University, West China Union University, Cheeloo University, etc., except for Sichuan University at Wangjianglou and part of Yanjing University in the city, are mostly concentrated here. The surrounding environment is very good, and the atmosphere of research is very strong. Comparing it with Shapingba in Chongqing, it's a world of difference. Shapingba is just chaotic and noisy, while Huaxi Dam is exceptionally orderly and quiet. Especially the long embankment of Houba, when spring deepens and summer begins, with willows hanging low and couples strolling, I believe that young friends, once they come here, would probably never want to go back. Huaxi Dam, once accustomed to quietness, is now becoming busy and restless, unable to maintain its former peace. Although the spring colors are deepening, Houba isn't as lively as in previous years. Fewer couples are there, and the weeping willows on both embankments aren't as green and vibrant as in previous winters.</p>
<h3 id="e100">The Flower Fair at Qingyang Palace - This Year, It's a "Bump and Knock" <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Qingyang Palace is outside the West Gate (Tonghui Gate) and has almost become the natural venue for the annual flower fair. The name "flower fair" is so appealing. Every year, many people from other counties rush to see the flowers. But in reality, the agricultural tools and seeds on the fairgrounds are even more impressive than the flowers. So, I think it would be more appropriate to call it an agricultural fair rather than a flower fair.</p>
<p>This year, because it's the first flower fair after the victory, the Provincial Department of Construction has specially approved its expansion, and the land rent is therefore higher than in previous years. (Last year, the Flower Industry Association didn't participate because the land rent was too high.) According to the abbot, "We only get to 'bump and knock' this once a year, unlike others who can 'bump and knock' all year round." According to this statement, it seems that their "gouging" is justified.</p>
<p>In addition to the flower market, the flower fair includes an agricultural tools market, a seed market, a bucket market, a bird market, an ironware market, a gourd market, a painting market, and a brush and ink market. There are also stalls selling antiques, tiger balm, medicine, shoes, silks, toys, knives and scissors, combs, jade, and jewelry, etc. The prices are generally higher than in the market, but there are many buyers, especially windmills, which are very popular. Whether adults or children, whoever goes to the flower fair usually comes back with one in hand. The nearby tea restaurants are decorated with pine and cypress branches, and business is excellent. Small food stalls form continuous tents with cloth umbrellas, offering Shuangliu Jiang noodles, Wenjiang Douhua, "Immortal Tangyuan," sugar-boiled sweet potatoes, and cold jelly noodles, Ciba etc., all very busy, creating a scene of "an overwhelming flow on the Shanyin Road."</p>
<p>Recently, some students from Sichuan University staged a full-scale martial arts performance while inspecting marching students, beating each other and injuring many. Incidents like these inevitably paint Chengdu's shadows even thicker.</p>
<p>Oh, Chengdu: When will you truly become peaceful, quiet, and serene? (March 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e101">Iran: Land of Petroleum <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Iran, formerly known as Persia, is mostly a high and dry plateau, averaging about four thousand feet in altitude. It is surrounded by towering mountains, with the northern ranges reaching as high as eighteen thousand seven hundred feet. The climate in the south and central regions is unbearably hot, while the climate in the north is extremely cold. The temperature on the plateau varies greatly between winter and summer. In some places, it drops to thirty-two degrees Fahrenheit in winter and rises to eighty degrees Fahrenheit in summer. Most areas receive less than ten inches of rainfall, with twenty inches in the northeast and forty inches on the narrow plains along the Caspian Sea, where the land is fertile. The Persian Gulf coast receives sufficient rainfall, but the hot tropical climate is unhygienic. The central and eastern regions are vast expanses of abundant sandy minerals. The Karun River is Iran's only important navigable river, passing through the fertile lowlands of Khuzestan and entering the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>People and Products</p>
<p>Iran has a population of fifteen million, of whom about two to three million are semi-nomadic, a number that is gradually decreasing. The rest mostly live in small towns and villages, mainly in the fertile areas near the Caspian Sea or in the northwestern province of Azerbaijan. In these two regions, crops can be grown without irrigation, but this is not possible on the plateau. The main crops are wheat, cotton, sugar, rice, fruit, and opium. Foreign trade is monopolized by the government. World-famous Persian carpets are the main industrial product. Other established industries include yarn mills, silk mills, carpet factories, cigarette factories, and cement plants. The main export is mineral oil. Iran's oil production normally accounts for the world's fourth-largest. Other minerals include coal, iron, steel, lead, copper, manganese, and nickel, but they have not yet been exploited on a large scale.</p>
<p>Turbulent History</p>
<p>Cyrus the Great established the Persian Empire two thousand five hundred years ago, encompassing all of the Middle East from India to the Mediterranean and from the Caucasus to the Indian Ocean. The Persian Empire was overthrown by Alexander the Great of Macedon in 331 BC. After that, Persian history entered a turbulent phase. In 636 AD, it was invaded by the Arabs; in the early 13th century, by the Mongols; it engaged in wars with the Romans, Huns, and Turks and experienced repeated internal strife. However, the Persians were able to maintain their national character and traditions, remaining unchanged.</p>
<p>Since the 19th century, Persia has been increasingly influenced by Western civilization, because it occupies an important strategic position for Britain, Russia, and France: for Britain, it could be used to defend its route to India; for Russia, to protect its southern border; and for France, it was a necessary condition for its ambition to expand its territory in the East. In 1901, oil was discovered in southern Persia, and since then, Persia's position has become even more important.</p>
<p>In 1906, at the request of the people, the autocratic rule of the Persian emperor came to an end. A new constitution was promulgated, establishing an upper house (half appointed, half elected) and a lower house (elected every two years). Prime Minister Reza Khan was elected emperor in the general election of 1925. During his reign, he worked hard to develop transportation and irrigation.</p>
<p>In August 1941, the British and Soviet governments demanded that the Iranian government expel German nationals. The British and Soviets were dissatisfied with the Iranian government's response to this matter and occupied Iran at the end of August. Emperor Reza abdicated, and the crown prince ascended the throne, expelling Axis personnel. In September 1941, Iran severed diplomatic relations with Germany and Italy, and in April 1942, it severed relations with Japan. In September 1943, Iran declared war on Germany. In January 1942, Britain and the Soviet Union signed an alliance treaty with Iran, in which they pledged to respect Iran's independence and territorial integrity. In the Tehran Declaration of December 1943, the three leaders declared "unity with the government of Iran, hoping to maintain Iran's independence, its sovereignty, and territorial integrity."</p>
<p>Due to its oil supply, especially its strategic position, Iran is of utmost importance to the United Nations. It is a base for defending India and the Middle East. It is a strategic liaison station for transporting military supplies to the Soviet Union. Highways and railways have been improved and used by British and American troops to transport Lend-Lease materials from the Persian Gulf to the Soviet army. (Translated by Zhang Deqian)</p>

<h3 id="e103">The Northeast Problem is Under the Watchful Eyes of the World - The Soviet Union Should Make a Choice <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The recent intensification of the Northeast problem has aroused concern among the people of the entire nation, and people around the world are also paying close attention to its development prospects. It is seen that this problem is not simply a matter concerning China's sovereignty, but rather an issue that affects world peace as a whole. At this critical juncture when the world is watching and the nation is filled with anxiety, President Chiang, in his address at the Central Memorial Week on the 25th, guaranteed that the Northeast problem would be solved properly, called on the people of the nation to trust the government, and not to be rash. He also reaffirmed that the friendship between China and the Soviet Union must be maintained and must continue to be enhanced, and should not be shaken by temporary or singular events.</p>
<p>President Chiang's instructions not only calmed the widespread anxiety and uncertainty, but also clarified the consistent diplomatic policy of maintaining and continuing to enhance Sino-Soviet friendship. In addition to wholeheartedly embracing President Chiang's correct instructions and completely trusting the government and supporting the government in order to achieve the goal of safeguarding national sovereignty, we are still willing to follow the ancient teaching of "loving people with virtue" and conduct a broad review of the diplomacy of the Soviet Union, a friendly nation, and offer sincere advice.</p>
<p>Let us try to review history. After the end of World War I in 1918, the world was swept by the tide of communism. Under the leadership of Britain, an anti-communist front was formed, and the Soviet Union was ostracized and isolated by various countries. This policy was later criticized by far-sighted politicians, because it threatened the security of the Soviet Union and indirectly affected future world peace. As the situation evolved, and with suspicions still not eradicated, Britain and France pulled the Soviet Union into the international group, until the signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact in August 1939. In between, the Soviet Union became the most faithful supporter of the League of Nations and the most enthusiastic advocate of collective security. Especially around the Munich Agreement in September 1938, the Soviet Union's diplomatic performance won the favor of people around the world; this was because it fully demonstrated the spirit of upholding justice and keeping treaties. As for the announcement of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, although it caused shock and unpleasant feelings among people at the time, since it did not receive understanding from Britain and France, the three-nation talks failed, and it was left hesitating between the democratic and aggressive (fascist) camps. In the end, it had no choice but to ally with Germany in order to ensure the temporary security of the country. The world gave it sympathy and forgave it. In June 1942, Hitler betrayed the treaty and suddenly attacked the Soviet Union. At this time, the Soviet Union not only became a faithful ally of the democratic camp, but also dispelled all the suspicions that the world had previously harbored towards it. Moreover, due to its creation of unprecedented brilliant achievements, all the allied countries that shared weal and woe with it gave it the highest respect. All of this shows that the Soviet Union has made painstaking efforts and great contributions in the pursuit of national security and world peace, and the people of the world, in their pursuit of truth, have invariably expressed admiration for those countries that strive for truth.</p>
<p>This glorious history of the Soviet Union truly inspires infinite longing and infinite hope in mankind. The world eagerly expects that it will be the strongest pillar in the arduous task of maintaining world peace and creating human happiness.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, since the collapse of Hitler and the unconditional surrender of Japan, up to the present day, truth in the Soviet Union's diplomatic performance has gradually evolved into a kind of mysterious and unfathomable principle. The impact of this has been to cause waves on the international political stage, one after another, dazzling people and making them feel overwhelmed. No wonder British Foreign Secretary Bevin issued an urgent call to it to "lay down the last trump card in your hand." This kind of Soviet diplomatic style, which transcends truth, has clearly caused widespread anxiety among peace-loving countries. From expectation to disappointment, from admiration to suspicion, the psychology of the world is changing. We feel that it is a great pity for the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Opening Ceremony of the Political Consultative Conference <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper in Chongqing, Zhao Haosheng</p>
<p>The first Political Consultative Conference after the victory, held after the Second Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Kuomintang and before the National Assembly, is of extremely great significance. It also coincides with the late spring month of March, when Chongqing is truly the flowering season for politics.</p>
<p>On the day of the opening, 212 councilors had already registered. At the entrance to the hall, everyone patted each other on the shoulder, shook hands, and exchanged greetings. Various accents were heard, creating an atmosphere of "dear friendship."</p>
<p>Approaching the Qingming Festival, in this time of intermittent warmth and cold, the councilors were dressed in a dazzling array of styles. Mr. Wang Zhanxiao wore a long gown and mandarin jacket, topped with a boat-shaped felt hat, a truly harmonious blend of Chinese and Western styles, with a unique flair. Xie Bingxin wore a blue gown, covered with a black velvet coat, looking thin, calm, and graceful. Chu Fucheng held a cane, while Zhang Junmai sported a complete set of elegant Western-style suits and coats, showing impressive manners. Hu Lin had just returned from the North the day before, and Cheng Shewo pulled him over, saying, "Brother, you've gotten fatter after your trip to the North."</p>
<p>Wang Yunwu had a "big kid" air about him, always lively and energetic, with a smile on his face. The elderly Mr. Shao Congen was once again escorted by his group. The old gentleman's movements and speech were all trembling, making him sound particularly touching. After signing his name, he bowed and greeted the elderly Mr. Liu Wenlong.</p>
<p>The hall was simply and plainly decorated. On the podium, there was a long table with a row of fresh flowers, and nothing else. The row on the right side of the hall was the seating area for the heads of the various ministries and commissions, followed by the seating area for foreign envoys and guests. The seating area for news reporters was originally on the long chairs against the wall, but moved to the guest seating area. In the coming ten-plus days, there will be another "scramble for seats" every day, and the "guest seating area" will probably become the reporter seating area due to "established fact."</p>
<p>The councilors sat in the two-thirds of the seats on the left side, still in assigned seats.</p>
<p>Two staff members from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sat in the front row of the foreign guests, serving as hosts. Soviet Ambassador Petrov brought Secretary Federin, who speaks Chinese the best, and sat in the second row.</p>
<p>President Song, Secretary-General Wu, and Deputy Chief of Staff Bai all arrived very early. Chief of Staff Chen Cheng arrived later, shaking hands and greeting everyone along the way, extremely busy.</p>
<p>Secretary-General of the Assembly Shao Lizi and Deputy Secretary-General Lei Zhen, the former short and stout, the latter tall and thin, stood under the stage before the meeting, gesturing and talking nervously, making for a very interesting scene.</p>
<p>After the ceremony, President Chiang stepped into the meeting hall, and the entire hall stood at attention, with thunderous applause, which did not stop until the President stepped onto the stage and took his seat. The President repeatedly smiled and bowed in thanks amidst the applause of the entire assembly. When Mr. Mo, in his address, mentioned that the hard-won victory of the eight-year war of resistance should first pay the highest respect to the Head of State, the entire assembly applauded loudly again, and the President once again bowed in thanks.</p>
<p>Mr. Mo's report, delivered in a pure Northeastern accent, was filled with extremely moving emotion. When he proposed that the assembly should pay attention to the Northeast problem, the entire assembly applauded loudly.</p>
<p>Before reading his speech, President Chiang specifically mentioned that the success of the victory of the War of Resistance, in addition to the blood and sacrifice of the people and soldiers of the entire nation, should especially thank the assistance of the Political Consultative Conference and the efforts of the people and government of Sichuan. The President's speech, which lasted about half an hour, constantly evoked prolonged and enthusiastic applause.</p>
<p>He Zhuhong's response, delivered in a pure Hebei accent, and Mr. Mo's Northeastern speech evoked a solemn and heavy feeling in the audience at the assembly.</p>
<p>When Zhu Huiqing questioned the economic report, he mentioned the establishment of the China Textile Corporation, saying that it violated national policy, broke faith with the allies, and even led price increases, becoming simply a price-increasing company. Was this really the government's policy? He said with emotion, "I'm afraid society is going to collapse."</p>
<p>Feng Shangdong asked Weng Wenhao: Is there a legal basis for the Executive Yuan's office?</p>
<p>Zhang Longguang questioned President Song, "Is the Executive Yuan's administrative efficiency relaxed? Can President Song be at peace?"</p>
<p>Someone asked, "Why, after the restoration of the Northeast, has it suffered so much from the ravages of war? Does the central government need tens of thousands of people?"</p>
<p>During the previous inquiries, someone complained that our diplomacy was too weak. (20th)</p>

<h3 id="e105">The Road of Chinese Cinema <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Cui</p>
<p>When the World Film Gathering was held in Venice in 1934, Austrian President Miklas delivered a valuable opinion on cinema. He said, "I believe that films should be used to educate and guide the masses, and the 'essence' expressed purely by film should be estimated and measured by its educational components. Even if the technical aspects of the film are expressed in a beautiful and excellent way, they must not violate the sacred concepts of mankind, but should contribute truth, goodness, and beauty, and avoid all profanity. They must not violate science and art, and even more so, they must not deviate from human and ethical points of view. Film is the 'transmission' of knowledge, and at the same time, a special art. Film is expressed on the screen by mixing the melody and music of human language. Art should always be noble and free, in other words, not violating ethical concepts. It must not incite obscenity, cruelty, or evil. Art is meant to bring joy and hope to those who toil daily, and to encourage them to move forward and upward. If every filmmaker can work towards this goal, they will naturally make a very great contribution to mankind."</p>
<p>Although President Miklas was speaking to the American film industry at the time, his opinion was actually aimed at the entire film industry. According to his view, film should bear a social mission. We agree with this valuable opinion of President Miklas. As a tool for "transmitting" the experience of human life, its value is of course incalculably higher than as a tool for entertainment. However, in order to "learn with interest," it is also necessary to retain amusing entertainment components, but it must be understood that this is only a means of achieving educational effectiveness, and not the purpose of film.</p>
<p>However, flipping through the catalogues of films produced by various countries around the world, there are indeed not a few films that conform to what President Miklas described, but most films still cannot escape the control of "Mammonism," turning into purely entertaining and recreational products in order to cater to the preferences of special leisure classes.</p>
<p>Looking at the entire Chinese film market for many years, at least 80% of the foreign films imported and screened are entertainment-oriented. If they contain educational significance, it is also of a negative nature. This is not to say that foreign film companies specifically import entertainment-oriented films into China to anesthetize and incite the Chinese people, but it is actually to cater to the base psychology of the general Chinese audience. When I was in Chongqing, several foreign film company merchants told me that Hollywood producers and distributors had expressed extreme surprise when they saw the Chinese market sales statistics, because films with slightly more serious awareness and higher taste could not make money in China. On the contrary, what could be welcomed by the Chinese audience were those colorful films with thighs, hugs, singing and dancing, detectives, and martial arts. In order to make profits, they naturally had to select and arrange these kinds of things to come. Looking back at our own production achievements, in terms of awareness and art, all the domestic films in the past are unbearable to discuss in detail. During the War of Resistance, all commercial companies collapsed, and the state-run film production institutions did not have satisfactory results due to the limitations of material conditions. But now that we have won, the Chinese film industry has reached a stage of emerging development. State-run film production institutions have begun filming, and commercial film companies will certainly spring up like mushrooms after rain in the near future. Therefore, I am writing this short article to specifically call the attention of our filmmakers: film is an important tool for education, and it bears a social mission! In China, there is an even more urgent need for this kind of educationally significant film. Therefore, we hope that the new films of China's future, in terms of technology, will be able to catch up with Europe and the United States, and in terms of awareness, must never violate the sacred obligations to mankind, avoiding all blasphemy; not violating ethics, and even more so, not inciting obscenity, cruelty, or evil. On the contrary, we expect films with social missions as educational tools, to use their great and sacred "transmission" to awaken our people from their drunken stupor, and to improve the society that has fallen morally and lost its ethics! Furthermore, to save our country and nation from baseness, poverty, and disorder!</p>
<h3 id="e106">Ticket Price Issues <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Hawk</p>
<p>The current movie ticket prices are unreasonably high. Anything that has increased more than a hundredfold in the past half-year or so is unreasonable. And movie ticket prices have increased more than a hundredfold.</p>
<p>Movie theater owners are taking advantage of Shanghainese people's love of movies to raise prices crazily. Like a triple jump, from the fake currency price of 2,000 yuan for first-run tickets in mid-August last year (legal currency 10 yuan), it has risen to the current minimum ticket price of 1,400 yuan. I want to say again, this is unreasonable. When first-run prices rise, second and third-run prices follow suit, and they rise sharply, which further promotes the "adjustment" of first-run prices again. Such repeated "adjustments" circulate endlessly, making it difficult for the general public to watch movies.</p>
<p>Calculate how many times rice has increased during this period? How many times has electricity increased? How many times have donation fees increased? How many times have general prices increased? How many times have other expenses increased? I believe that on average it is less than fifty times. Moreover, the number of viewers is now many times greater than before, as you can see by looking at the "Sold Out" signs.</p>
<p>However, movie theater owners don't care about these things. They are still not satisfied with the "one ticket for half a *dou* of rice" principle! They specifically took the "This theater is ordered to collect 50% entertainment tax from today" announcement as an excuse to distract the audience. Regrettably, the municipal government, in order to greedily pursue higher tax revenue, has forgotten the purpose of movies as a means of mental adjustment and education for the general public, and has approved the price increase. And it has increased so drastically!</p>
<p>I think the ticket prices should not be so close together as they are now (taking the first-run as 1,400, 1,600, 1,800). Instead, they should be spaced relatively far apart as they were before the war. That is to say, the lowest ticket price should be suppressed as much as possible, and the highest ticket price may be slightly higher. Before the war, the difference between the highest and lowest was often three or four times. Now? It's only one-tenth or two-tenths. This is too disproportionate. This can not only be considerate of the general public, but it is also beneficial to the theaters, and it does not lose the purpose of entertainment for the masses. As for the gap between first and second runs, and second and third runs, there should also be a considerable distance (previously it was more than one or two times), so that it is not easy to stimulate further price increases.</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of brochures, they should not be so cluttered and disorganized. Often, two or three kinds of so-called "special editions," which are extremely poor in content, are printed and sold at high prices. This is an invisible loss for the audience. The theater authorities should print one or two pages of plot descriptions in a standardized format, and give them away with the tickets, or at least sell them at cost. Asia Theater used to be very ideal in this regard. Although the movie synopses in a certain major newspaper's supplement is a remedy, it does not seem to be very good.</p>

<h3 id="e107">### Counterattack in Burma by Lang Huan <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Lang Huan</p>
<p>This is a film with war as its theme. Like a group of films with war as their theme, it is more or less inevitable that it will be somewhat exaggerated, but because the actors are responsible, the insertions are appropriate, and the photography is beautiful, it is still a film worth recommending.</p>
<p>The prologue is General Stilwell's vow to restore Burma, followed by the plot unfolding in an exciting mood. A team of American paratroopers stationed in the tea plantation in northern India, led by Captain Nelson (played by Errol Flynn), are eagerly awaiting departure when they receive instructions to risk destroying the Japanese radar base 150 miles behind the Japanese front line.</p>
<p>More than fifty paratroopers, led by Captain Nelson, set off together. Among the group are Lieutenant Jacob (played by William Prince), war correspondent William (played by Henry Hull), and Chinese liaison officer Captain Li Hao, etc. After arriving at their destination, Captain Nelson used clever tactics to destroy the Japanese radar base. However, the entire army has fallen into a forest surrounded by enemies on all sides. Although Captain Nelson urgently led his subordinates to the pre-designated location to wait for the plane to rescue them back to defense, at that moment, a large patrol of the Japanese army suddenly arrived, and the paratroopers were surrounded.</p>
<p>Captain Nelson divided the troops into two teams, with another team led by Lieutenant Jacob, to break through and then regroup. Although Captain Nelson's team escaped after experiencing danger and received air support, the troops led by Jacob were surrounded and martyred due to being deeply involved in the enemy's forces.</p>
<p>Nelson and others mistakenly believed that Jacob and others were still alive, and urgently went to rescue them. Although they had a last meeting with Jacob, many members of the team were killed or injured due to the Japanese army's pursuit.</p>
<p>After this, they were forced to endure hunger and thirst, the invasion of disease, and the Japanese army's tracking and attacks. William and others died on the way because they could not bear the hardship, and the wireless telegraph was destroyed, further severing all contact between the entire team and the headquarters. However, Nelson and others, with their indomitable courage, finally obtained assistance, and used clever tactics to wipe out a large number of advancing enemy troops. At this time, a large number of allied forces also attacked Burma, and Nelson led the remaining eleven heroes and returned to the base.</p>
<p>In the film "Counterattack in Burma," Errol Flynn's performance can be said to be very successful. He has a fairly profound simulation of the kind of passionate and determined personality of a soldier, especially in the scenes where he bids farewell to Jacob and encourages his subordinates on the mountain.</p>
<p>The plot has been developing in a tense manner. The tense expression when parachuting is very realistic. The scene of destroying the enemy on the mountain is quite beautiful, but the best part is Nelson's dim expression when he returns to the base and hands over the badges of the fallen troops, which makes people get some aftertaste, and feels that this is at least not a purely propaganda or nonsense film.</p>
<p>The foolishness of the Japanese army is portrayed a little too much, but their crimes of abusing prisoners and slaughtering innocents may not be fully depicted.</p>
<p>Because the cinematography director of this film is Chinese cinematographer Huang Zongzhan, there is some proud joy when seeing the beautiful pictures in the film. Although Tang Fo-lan, who plays the Chinese liaison officer Captain Li Hao, feels a bit dull and has no expression, it does not reduce the audience's interest in the appearance of Chinese people in the film.</p>
<p>After watching "Counterattack in Burma," because of the similarity of the scenes, I naturally thought of "The Human Comedy" starring Spencer Tracy, but one is full of the smell of invading small nations, and the other expresses the idea of resisting tyranny and defending justice. The standpoint is indeed different. Perhaps this is the reason why "Counterattack in Burma" has gained the audience's sympathy.</p>
<h3 id="e108">The Three Theaters of the Film Industry <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Mental Asylum, Nursing Home, and Sanatorium</p>
<p>The three surviving film studios in Chongqing once had the "elegant names" of mental asylum, nursing home, and tuberculosis sanatorium. What is the inside story? Please read the following article.</p>
<p>The people in "China Film Studio" are mostly young and strong, and things like fighting and causing trouble often happen. For example, the "burning of Benlan's military service film" and "collective attack on a certain movie theater" incidents, this is in terms of external relations. Internally, mutual friction and pulling out fists are also common, so it is called a "mental asylum."</p>
<p>The people in "China Electric Film Studio" are mostly old-fashioned, living in the southern city and not listening or asking. In terms of work, they maintain a rigid attitude of "seeking no merit but seeking no fault." People call it a "nursing home." Who says it's not appropriate?</p>
<p>"China Education Film Studio", located in Beibei, is presided over by Chen Guofu, who suffered from lung disease in his early years. The late deputy director Yu Zhongying had severe lung disease. Moreover, because the environment there is quiet and the air is fresh, it is very suitable for treating lung diseases. "China Education Film Studio's" film production mainly focuses on 16mm small-format films, and the production is relatively slow, as if suffering from lung disease.</p>
<p>Thus, the three theaters, the mental asylum and the nursing home, have successively moved to Shanghai, and the sanatorium will also move to Beijing soon. I hope that moving the theaters will be good. The lunatics in the "mental asylum" will return to a normal state as soon as possible. The old-fashioned people in the "nursing home" will sweep away their twilight mood. The lung patients in the "sanatorium" will gradually become healthy.</p>

<p>Soliciting Modern People's Deeds</p>
<p>In order to correct social customs and respond to the New Life Movement, the Confucius Society has launched a campaign to solicit moral deeds of modern people from various provinces, counties, and townships, namely (Filial Piety, Brotherly Love, Loyalty, Faithfulness, Propriety, Righteousness, Integrity, Shame). Anyone who conforms to one or several of the eight virtues can report the facts to the society. After the society investigates and verifies the facts, it will compile the deeds into a book and publish a special collection to promote and encourage loyalty. It will also issue certificates of merit in accordance with the articles of association. Those who conform to several virtues will be recommended by the society to the government for commendation. This move by the society is indeed beneficial to people's hearts and will enhance social morality. Anyone from all walks of life who knows of such facts can send a letter to the society to report them. The society's address is 954 Zhongzheng Road, Confucius Society.</p>

<p>Chen Huchu from Nantong Tangzha asked: My son is nine years old, strong and healthy, and is now suffering from epilepsy, which has gradually made his nerves sluggish. Last year, one night at midnight, he got up in a drowsy state, urinated, and then sat upright on the bed, his eyes squinting upwards. I called him repeatedly, but he did not respond. Later, after drinking warm soup, he regained consciousness. The next morning, he had no symptoms, so I did not suspect anything. But this year, after falling asleep, he gave a cry, and then his eyes widened and his limbs twitched uncontrollably. His breathing seemed to be blocked and he had phlegm sounds. It lasted for five minutes before it stopped. After he recovered, he was extremely exhausted. Please advise on treatment methods.</p>
<p>Doctor Qi replied: Your son's illness is likely to be epilepsy. A detailed examination of his blood, urine, and nervous system is necessary to determine the treatment plan.</p>
<p>Xiao Guorong and Xu Liangsun asked: (1) Can vaccination with cowpox provide immunity? Should it be done every year or two?</p>
<p>Doctor Gu Yuqi replied: Vaccination with cowpox can provide immunity. It is best to vaccinate once a year. Adults can do it every other year, but it is still advisable to vaccinate every year during a smallpox epidemic.</p>
<p>Tian Shiyu asked: I masturbated when I was fifteen or sixteen years old. I got married at seventeen and had affairs with prostitutes because of incompatibility, and contracted gonorrhea. Fortunately, I used medicine and recovered in two months. Now I feel cold in my kidneys and have premature ejaculation and soreness. Please advise on treatment methods?</p>
<p>Doctor Xian Yuqi replied: This kind of symptoms requires medicine to replenish blood and strengthen the body and replenish internal secretions, which may lead to recovery. It is hoped that you will seek treatment from a specialist doctor.</p>

<p>Please Investigate by Military and Political Authorities</p>
<p>Dear Editor: Our town, Huangdu, is located between Shanghai and Suzhou, and is an important road and waterway. Most of Shanghai's rice passes through our town. Recently, some unscrupulous people have been detaining ships loaded with rice bound for Shanghai one by one, extorting two *sheng* of grain per *shi* as a donation for their own benefit. Otherwise, passage is not allowed. In terms of reason, this is indeed illegal. The receipts they issue do not bear the name of the county government or the district office, which is undoubtedly an extortion. At this time of the restoration of peace, there are still such shameless people using public office for private gain, which greatly affects the recent soaring rice prices in Shanghai. I humbly request your newspaper to disclose this and urge the military and political authorities to take effective measures. The Qingpu County Government should strictly order the eradication of these corrupt elements who oppress the people, for the benefit of the 3.5 million people of Shanghai. Huangdu Town resident Dai ×× respectfully.</p>

<p>Recently, we have received generous donations of counterfeit banknotes from all walks of life to be used as aid, which is truly commendable.
