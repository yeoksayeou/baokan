<h3 id="c1">四百餘記者赴採訪　公開審判頭號漢奸　陳逆撰六萬言自白書　庭訉後可能下週宣判 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報特派記者蘇州四日下午十一時卅分急電〕和暖明媚天氣，帶給人們以愉快；而公開審帶頭號漢奸陳逆公博，允帶給此問人士以無限興奮。日來大街小巷酒肆茶樓，談論中心，皆集中於此事件，京滬各報特派來蘇採訪之記者，已達四五五人，伊等多下榻樂鄕飯店，若干市民趨此打聽消息，致此飯店不啻成爲一新聞機關。蘇報今晨招待，以示同業之聯歡。除各報記者外，「中電」「中製」亦特派專人，來蘇攝影，錄音，計攝影技師等約四十人。按蘇州電廠原爲每日下午五時發電，經「中電」與高院向電廠再三交涉，始允於下午二時半發電，惟電廠要求貼補煤費。「中電」攝影師技師廿餘人，今日下午在第一刑庭佈置燈光，並試光度，業已就緒。</p>
<p>五日下午三時半開審，高院對一切準備事項均已辦妥。第一刑庭旁聽席原僅能容一百四十餘人，現亦加以擴充，旁聽券截至記者發此電時止，已發出二百六十餘張，高院雖早聲明停發，但遇重要人員旁聽，仍可通融辦理，現法庭門外，亦排列長突，以便容納。高院又特規定，禁止記者任意跑動，俾免妨礙攝影及法庭秩序。聞陳逆公博之子已來蘇，準備旁聽，軍委會亦派有要員前來。</p>
<p>審訊法官頃已決定由高院院長孫鴻霖任審判長，主任推事石美瑜，陪席推事陳家瑞，首席檢察官韓蘇。高院楊書記官仍任書記官。楊連日奇忙，應付各方佈置一切，大有食不暇飽之慨。</p>
<p>關於戒備方面，計出動武裝法警廿一人，保衛四人提押陳逆，由蘇子民警長率領六人負責，押庭四人，監視法庭秩序三人，戒護庭外四人。陳逆由看守所提庭時，原擬用汽車提押，頃已決定改用包軍，届時車過處，預料定萬人空巷，爭睹此大漢奸有如何一劃而孔也。陳逆並未延請律師，祇由院方指定院方公役律師高溶代爲辯護。聞陳逆在獄中自撰有自白書，長約六萬餘字，另撰有辯訴狀兩份，已於數日前呈遞高院。陳逆在獄中間嘗作詩自遣，惟詩韻不佳，平仄不調。又軍委會派人携來僞府成立時所攝有聲電影，或將於必要時開映。</p>
<p>褚逆已誼陳逆璧君　審期本月中旬前後</p>
<p>〔中央社蘇州四日電〕陳逆曾由蘇高院檢察處開偵訊庭三次，並由首席檢察官搜集得陳逆組織偽府附敵之計據兩箱，故此次審訊陳逆，得便利不少。據記者探悉，陳逆於明日審訊後，可能於本月十一日宣判。又訊：褚逆民該，陳逆璧君，將繼陳逆於本月中句在蘇高院開審，其時間或將在十五日及十六日。僞宣傳部長林逆柏生，則未解蘇，現仍覊押南京，聞將不再解蘇，而由南京法庭開審。又據石美瑜庭長語記者，將於八日宣判之繆斌，其罪刑除根據法律外，並將參酌一般輿情定讞。至於發還更審之張逆北生，其更審主點，僅爲出賣馬元放「賣友求榮」一罪之是否成立，其餘淸鄕，封鎖地方，收編訓練僞軍各罪狀，則仍成立，即此數罪，已足够受其前所判之罪刑矣。</p>
<p>〔又電〕記者今晨赴蘇高院，審判長孫鴻霖，正端坐院長室，硏閱此一巨奸案之成堆文卷。案旁並有留聲機一架，及唱片數張，此物將爲明日審奸時之一大證據。蓋唱片係我方獲自敵人者，內有陳逆在長春偽滿建國第三週紀念日之演講調錄音片。</p>
<p>〔本報蘇州四日電〕石美瑜庭長兼南京軍事法庭庭長，每屋期中，三日留蘇，三日去京。審繆斌時，曾要求繆作軍事法庭證人，繆欣然許之。</p>
<h3 id="c2">審訊逮捕奸逆加緊進行　京魯冀積極肅奸　蘇獄中拘押八百餘名待審 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日專電〕去年九月二十六日以後，在京陸續就逮之漢奸陳之碩，潘澤元，華澤衍，夏國强，徐義宗，戴書培，錢森，姚剛，鄧沫，楊建中，凌峯，吳匯東，楊振，顧大樁，鄭奪秋，郞祖淼，何道淺，夏昌祖，陳寳亭，劉開發，沈秀文，郭堵庭，杜炳，王春和，美永奎，伍微社，張秉權等三十二人，完明（五日）移解首都高等法院監獄待審。陳逆之碩，曾任偽財部次長，兼僞財政專門委員會主任，僞行政院政務參贊，僞敵產委員會秘書長等重要僞職。潘澤元曾任僞警衛師及僞警備部參謀處長。華澤衍曾任僞警衛師副官處長。陳昌祖會任偽中將參軍。聞潘華夏等尙將轉移軍法機關審訊。</p>

<p>〔中央社南昌四日電〕贛現正展開肅奸工作，先後被捕運送法院審辦者，達三百餘人，此批奸徒，多係贛西北奉新安義等縣之僞維持會之負責人，或替敵軍刺探軍情之密探。偽江西省府代主席周逆貫虹，亦已入獄，將由主辦機關，解送法院。</p>
<p>〔中央社蘇州四日電〕蘇省漢奸，刻已集中蘇州待審。江蘇高等法院看守所中，現共拘押自京及蘇省各地解來之漢奸八百餘人，中女漢奸十人。此外並有危害民國罪之罪犯三百餘人，彼等均將審訊判刑。看守所所長汪維錚，對的內管理，極為嚴密，秩序頗好。</p>

<p>軍警憲當局檢查戶口</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平四日電〕共產黨人員被捕後，已有五人獲釋，其中一人係隷屬於調處執行部之共產黨人員。「新華社」與「解放日報」之辦事員四十二人，則仍被拘留中。據報載葉劍英曾提出六點要求：（一）應處罰搜查之人、（二）軍事機關及平市府應登報道歉，（三）賠償損失，（四）保證不再有此類事件，（五）被捕各人一律釋放，（六）報館應立即啓到。</p>
<p>〔本報北平三日電〕此間空氣突吿緊張，昨夜軍警憲檢查戶口，方壺齋九號新華社北平分社，三道柵欄四十二號解放三日刊發行部，及前京　道十一號十八集團軍辦事處，俱經檢查，今晨並將三處中共人員四十八人，分別帶至外二處警察局及內四區警察局問話。今晚七時半，共方招待記者，中共方面十八集團軍副參謀長勝代遠稱：彼今日曾赴北平行營十一戰區長官部市政府詢問，各當局俱稱事先不知此事，允予調查，今晨中共人員被帶局問話者，計方壺齋新華社姜吉辰楊校賡等二十九人，三道柵欄解放三日刋副經理馬建民等十三人，新京幾道十八集團軍辦事處勝代遠之秘書及其夫人女孩等四人。聞外二區警察局楊督察長內四區徐姓局員，對往訪記者稱：此次純係檢查戶口。據悉，今午新華社分社社長饒俊瑞赴外二區警察局詢問究竟，局方曾請饒具結俾將帶局人員釋放，中共人員已加拒絕。</p>
<h3 id="c6">省自治法由專委研討　政協小組續開會　青年黨經調解已允出席 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>〔本報重慶四日電〕政協綜合小組與憲草審議會聯席會議，昨仍繼續舉行，靑年黨代表未出席，各項商討照常進行。對省自治法是否須經立法院通過，以中央棄權與地方均權整個政治問題，若地方均權眞實含義明白確定，立法院有無權利通過省自治法一事，自可迎刀而解，故當塲推定王寵惠。張君勱。秦邦憲。陳啓天·王雲五等組織一專門委員會，研究此項問題，該委員會訂今日下午開會。關於靑年黨代表未出席一事，昨日孫科張君勱等以私人資格前往勸解，各重大問題，定明（五日）下午二時，再行集會商討。</p>

<p>行政院答參政會詢問</p>
<p>〔報重慶四日電〕日前參政會曾有人提出詢問之國大代表不兼任官吏問題，茲據行政院正式答覆，其理由探悉如下：國民大會是由人民組織而成，政府官吏亦具有國民身份，如爲選民所擁護，自無不可當選，並兼任國大代表之理由。如英國內閣閣員，完全由人民所選之議員兼任，其他各國亦多無限制人民代表，不能兼任官吏之規定。我國情形特殊，總理遺敎中對此有明確規定，爲防止官吏操縱起見，在上次選舉國大代表時，特限制服務該選舉區之行政首長，不得當選爲該區之國民代表，以謀兼顧。</p>

<p>一昨字林西報刋載民營企業的前途一文，內稱：「雖然中國目前正在積極進行復員，但據生產界方面中人觀察，民營企業在短期內仍未許樂觀。據稱：中國之民營企業原曾享有廉價勞工及充分原料的優越條件，現正一方面遭受國營企業及政府津貼之企業的劇烈競爭，一方面又遭到國外價廉物美的輸入品的競爭。中國經多年的戰爭而感到原料匱乏，同時生產及運輸費用的繼續增高，使民營企業與政府所經營的企業進行着一種必然失敗的競爭。多數民營企業之須向政府貸款，足以表示他們正面臨一個嚴重的危機，而常態的恢復，似不能期之於最近的將米一。此雖爲外人的論調，然對於中國民營企業的前途，要亦不失爲一種雖不中亦不遠的觀測。</p>
<p>的確，從日寇投降以來的七月間，復員和建國已成爲一般人的口頭禪。這時間雖然並不太長，然而我們試一想倒底這七個月來有些什麼成績，誠不免令人感慨萬千。建國復員，不是空口說白話就可算數，必須有具體的事實，必須有行動的成就。民營企業旣不必受着龐雜的政治機構的牽制，値茲勝利建利國之會，本應活力充沛向復員及建設途中邁進，然而這幾個月來的形勢，民營企業不但未曾滿具生力致力於復員及建設，反而轉呈萎縮不振之態。這種局勢，若是讓它長存，絲毫不想法挽救過來，那是復員建國不知要等到何時，中國的工業化的前途也不堪設想！</p>
<p>這種局勢的形成，其原因雖不單純，大要言之，實山於政府對於民營企業政策的不定，以致人民意存觀望，裹足不前。目今國內政治局必的動盪，雖亦足以使一般投資者未敢從事冒險，然政治局勢的演變，人民多少有個自信，就是無論中共多少猖狂，此後中國的政局多半須靠國民黨的努力而穩定下來。現在使他們深覺遺憾的，倒是國民黨負責當局的做法使他們有些莫名其妙。國民黨的政綱政策雖有維護民營企業的明文，雖有劃分國營民營界限的規定，可是在實際上，政策是政策，行動是行動，雙方似乎並無關聯。至於黨義及公民敎程所授的主義是一件事，而在實際施政上所採取的辦法更是另一回事。因為有這種矛盾，民營企業就感到走頭無路，一些可憐的民族資本家——實在說不到資本家——因此未能發揮他們的生力，復員建設也就不免停滯下來。</p>
<p>舉最近兩個例子來說：第一是中紡中蠶公司的成立，說來是一種過渡時期的辦法，並不是國營的政策要擴大深入到民營企業的領城內去；但實際上，此項公司的成立，有政府的後援，有特別的優惠，譬如它們買燃料的價格就可和普通工廠不同。像這蘇不平等的競爭，民營企業那裏會有生路？第二，國民黨二中全會最後一天的會議，通過了宋院畏所提加速經濟復員緊急措施辦法，規定勞資糾紛應由政府調解仲裁，不得擅自怠工罷工，如仲裁不能成立，政府得接管該民營企業。這固然是美國曾經行過的辦法，但我們先得硏討調解仲裁是否確能持平合理。如仲裁的結果確非資方所能負担，是否國家代管以後即可照仲裁決定的工資付給而不致虧本？國家有力量虧本，固在所不計，但何能强民營企業以必須虧本？如果這辦法隨便使用，民營企業隨時有被政府接管的可能。與政府在可能範圍內獎進民營企業的大政方針恐又背道而馳。人民在此種政策威脅之下，如何能鼓起勇氣熟誠於民營企業的發展？近來標賣工廠所以漸漸難得受主，就可看出這種現象。在戰時之美國，民營企業對政府接管辦法猶有不甘，涉訟至最高法院，認爲國家縱有戰事，亦無接管民營企業之權，聯邦政府竟遭敗訴，民營企業的利益得到保護。我國値抗戰勝利建國之會，正需要多方扶植民營企業的發展，執行此項政策自宜愼重考慮。</p>
<p>此外，我們再來看看目前的外匯牌價，影響於國內的生產事業如何。照美金每元合法幣二〇二〇元的匯率來計算，舶來品漲價不過合戰前的七百倍，再加以美國貨幣的相當貶値以及應納的關稅，大槪外貨輸入的價格總不離戰前千倍左右，而且前我國生產成品的價格恐怕至少要比戰前漲二千倍，試問如何可以和外貨相競爭？不但工業製造品如此，即使農產品也將遭受同樣的命運。現在一般紗廠競購美棉而置陝棉於不顧，就是因爲美棉價廉而定貨到期準確，沒有購買陜棉的困擾。字林西報所說，民營企業一方受國營企業之劇烈競爭，一方又遭到價廉物美的舶來品的壓迫，眞是道蔚了病症之所在。故在這種匯率之下，我們必須於匯價外，更從關稅方面設法多多維護本國的民營企業，凡是本國所能製造的工業品，我們應獎進其原料的輸入，而杜絕其同類製造品的進口，庶幾民營企業還能有一些出路。</p>
<p>總之，戰後中國的復興建設，要以生產復員爲第一，而生產復員便少不了民營企業的協力。我們願正吿當局，限光須放得遠，培養民問的富力，就等於增厚國家的資源，萬不可處處存着「與民爭利」的近視之見，在有意無意中逐漸斷傷民營企業恢復的生機。維護治安，恢復交通，限定國營範圍，平息工潮爭議，這都是解除民營企業障礙的重要設施，政府應以全力達成共任務。</p>

<p>踏進了森嚴的上海監獄大門，看到的盡是些高牆，鐵柵，使人不由自主聯帶給想起了蓬頭垢面的囚犯和陰森小室中度着漫長的歲月，便感到凛然寒慄。</p>
<p>爲了衆所囑目的大漢奸已有七十一名解進，記者特走訪監獄當局，探詢一點關於他們的消息。</p>
<p>這批漢奸現在都關在獄中的忠字監內。忠字監是一幢五層的水泥建築，共有監房三百七十四間。現在重要的漢奸每人一室，比較經的則二三人一問。那末三百七十四間一共可以收押一千名左右。爲鄭重計，忠字監的看守人員亦因之比較他監爲多。</p>
<p>前天當這批漢奸押進的時候，各人身邊多少都有點錢。但是如今都由當局負責保管了。囚室內並沒有床舖，除了因年邁有病經特許者外，不管過去是什麽「院長」，「部長』，「省長」，「局長」，如今都祇能委屈他們，攤開被來，嘗嘗席地而臥的滋味了。</p>
<p>住在獄中的漢奸，因爲情形特殊，和其他囚犯不同，一切家屬和辯護律師，一概不准接見。但是他們每天在規定時間內，亦可以分批的走出囚室外走動走動。當然，在他們的身邊，少不了看守人員的監視。</p>
<p>監獄常局並不因爲大漢奸和其他囚犯不同，彼此的囚糧便因之差異。過去吃慣山珍海味牛奶鮮菓的這些「新貴」們，他們的囚糧如今和一些小竊盜賊的罪犯一樣了。每天都是廿一足兩，另加蔬菜。可是因爲家屬每星期四可送換衣被，星期二及五可送食品，有外來的接濟，對於監內的飯菜，便因之不多吃了。</p>
<p>公審期近了，這些漢奸的家屬正紛紛在外面奔走，延聘律師，準備辯護。想起了過去他們倚仗敵勢，爲虎作倀，魚肉人民時，我負不知他們將怎樣來自圓其說。難道又說是有功於國，作爲掩護的地下工作同志嗎？，</p>
<p>當告辭回出時，大門旁正排滿了他們來送衣被的家屬。昔日的主子已經垮合，過去的夢已經粉碎。如今正有萬千雙抗戰殉難軍民的眼睛注視着他們，萬千雙受難同胞的手舉起了要向他們算賬。然而，他們如今究竟覺醒了沒有？（穆人）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕上海市臨時參議會，昨晨九時十五分舉行第七次大會，到參議員三十一人，由社會局局長吳開先報吿社會局工作摘誌如下。</p>
<p>社會局報告</p>
<p>經濟行政，（一）公司登記：迄今已核准備案者，計三〇八件。（二）洋商公司登記，因洋商公司法尙未公布，故目前尙無登記者。（三）收復區各種公司登記。繳騐執照者計八十四件。　工商登記。迄今申請登記者，計六八一家，商號一一，五四五家。登記費則已由千分之五，減至千分之一。民衆組織：（一）工商業同業公會：本市工人有組織者，戰前有八十萬人，現有五十萬至六十萬人，（但尙有手工業工人等未參加組織者除外）。商人有四十萬至五十萬人，自由職業者約二萬至三萬人。（二）整理之工會有七十單位，成立者人　　。到春種社團成立者一三單位。勞工行政：（一）工潮之處理：去年九月至二月底，經辦工人勞資爭議計四八九件，店員職工勞資爭議八六〇件，已解決者一，一六〇件。（二）失業之救濟：由社會部京滬特派員會同辦理，去年八九月間，失業工人計七萬餘，現爲三萬餘救濟工人，最初發給現金，因發現缺點，每一成人，每月改發麵粉一袋半，童工每月一袋。（三）籌備勞工福利及組織工資評議會。至工潮發生原因，最主要者爲（一）工人受敵僞八年壓迫，一旦解放，難免失常。（二）物價波動，生活不得安定，理智無以控制。（三）大部工廠不能復業，工人無生活保障。工潮種類又可分二類：（一）要求改善待遇，（二）要求復工，尤以前者居多數，局方決按生活指數調整待遇，而對於要求調整底薪，則不予同意。今後處理勞資糾紛，擬採二法；（甲）舉行工廠會議，實行協調。（乙）一切依法辦理，搜自罷工怠工閉廠停業者，則會同治安機關，予以取締。文化事業：（一）報紙登記者六〇單位，雜誌二四七單位，通訊社一八單位，書籍二二四種，劇本四九種。現有若干小型刋物，極有敗壞風紀之現象，此類越軌刋物，決將會屬警　予以取締。（二）核准劇院登記者四一家，肥團九〇家，書塲一九家。社會福利事業：慈善團體登記者計八五單位，公益團體二二單位。救濟工作（一）設立難民難童收容所，在漕河涇共收容一三〇五人。（二）公典成立者有一所，尙有二所正籌備中。（三）辦理冬振曾設立庇寒所，現除可遣散之靴民外，餘均劃歸收容所。</p>
<p>參員質詢</p>
<p>吳局長報完畢，大會休息十分鐘後，即由徐、永祚提出質詢：（一）商登記費雖已减輕，其他單行法中修正條例有否頒布？（二）經濟部燃料委員會，辦理煤斤，專供國營工廠，現民營亦雖有配給，但市民毫無機會取得，有何辦法？（三）一般與論對於生活指數，頗有疑問，尤以房租一項，達三千一百餘倍，雖包括燃料，然仍驚人，請予解釋。（四）工人要求提高底薪，旣不予變更，惟最近各大公司等職工底著，何以均有變更。水祥雲希望：（一）處理工潮再多多努力，不使擴大。（二）內地來滬工人已達一千四百餘人，而經介紹職業者僅七人，希望確定統一待遇基數標準。（三）店員紛紛組織工會，是吾合理？（四）注意救濟娼姣，轉移社會風俗。潘序倫對於工資政策及生活指數方面，感想甚多，略云：目前受工潮影響最大者爲團營，公用及文化事業，對於社會局現行工資政策，有人認爲乃替資本家說話，實係武斷。勞工界同胞應用冷靜頭腦，遠大眼光，予以正確判斷。對於按照生活指數發給工資，認爲不合經濟原理。前曾提貢意見，遭勞工處李劍華處長反對。實際上，工資如按生活指數，則非生產所能負担，因中國現時生產指數，遠在生活費用指數之下，如果實行，則必蹈坐吃山空之惡果。</p>
<p>局長答復</p>
<p>吳局長因欲參加宋院長重要會議，時間不及，故先答覆三參議員質詢各點：（一）工商登記及其他各點，曾鄭重處理，先與市商會及經濟部特派員交換意見，同意修正各點，再由市政會議通過，然後呈請中央審核。（二）燃料委員會本係市府組織，後由中央管理，起初煤斤專供公用事業，其後市民配給燃料，憑電燈收費單購買煤屑五十斤及煤球等，但數量方面，確屬微小。（三）生活指數分工人，職員，及西人三種，工人生活指數全以生活必需品如食糧（蔬菜，油類，麵粉等），居住（包括房租，水電，燃料，衣着等），項目頗爲簡單。工資變更底薪，事由勞資雙方先行同意所致，局方自亦未便干涉。（四）工廠會議制度，可使勞資會商各項資產，生產等問題，使勞方瞭解資方困難，不作過份要求，此種制度收效實匪淺鮮。（五）內來工人，給予工作，乃理所當然，但因兩力工人往往以不能合作，引起糾紛，故曾請經濟部專撥工廠三所，爲內來工人工作，業經批准，不久即可分發。至同工同酬辦法，在目前中國工業落後之國家，尙不可能，僅能適用於同一廠內。因小工廠如亦按此辦法，則必無以維持。（六）店員依法不得自組工會，最合理者，爲組織聯誼會。（七）轉移社會風氣，自當努力辦理。但對於一部份娼妓，雖經介紹職業而仍願回復本業，殊覺失望。（八）本局現行工資政策，乃依歐美各國普遍辦法，即在戰時實行最高工資，在平時爲保障最低生活起見，實行最低工資。現一般工廠情形，勞動紀律不良，設備及原動力不够，資本不足，即係增加生產指數之原因。（九）一部份工人旣得足以維持生活之工資，尙提出不合理要求，自當以行動制止行動。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕中國銀行倫敦分行經理兼倫敦中英商會副會長李德燏氏，留英辦理行務，已歷十七載；上月十日飛渝述職，並於週前抵滬，記者特趨訪問，詢以英國經濟狀况，及中英貿易之前途。承詳爲解答，茲誌要如次：渠稱英國受大戰影響，元氣大耗，故戰後本身經濟狀况欠佳。現已陸續向美國借到款項，補充戰時損毀之各工廠機器，添辦糧食，迨國內情形逐步好轉後，即將全面恢復出口貿易。據佔計目前出口數量，已達戰前全盛時期出口數量百分之六十，此後可望繼續增加。同時亟望我國能將戰前運銷彼邦之鷄蛋猪鬃皮張等貨物，陸續輸往該國，俾英國產物，亦能常時輸入我國，使以貨易貨之制度，能推行盡利。</p>
<p>記者詢以外匯市塲開放後，中英電匯率是否應早日公布？渠稱：能早日公布則最佳，惟目前以中英問戰後貿易不多，事實上尙無正式公布之必要。現本市對英匯之結算，係按英金每鎊合美金三元七角之此率計算，而英人方面，固仍望能按英美原有匯率四元〇三分之比率計算。目前在華之英商，以我國物價高昂，而英國本身經濟情况又未復原，故尙未推動中英間之正常貿易，惟渠信此乃過渡時期必有之現象，不久即可恢復過去貿易之盛况云。</p>

<p>夫老死爲生物必不可免之現象，動物之壽者最多不過五百年，故生物必於個體未老死以前，生育幼小以謀個體「存在」之重演與擴大。惟凡幼小必弱，愈高等之動物，其幼小愈柔弱不能自存，飢不能自食，寒不能自衣，遇險不知避，遇敵不能防，使一切成長者皆報以冷淡無情，不喜扶育，則一切弱小祇有凋零萎悴，無以遂其生長，宇宙萬有，亦將歸於幻減，故同情弱小，愛憐弱小，扶育弱小，爲一切成長者之本性。康請曰：「如保赤子」。孟子曰：「今人乍見孺子將入於井，皆有怵惕惻隱之心」。人類之所以能生存繁榮，萬有之所以能生生不已，一在於有弱小以彌補必不可免之老死缺陷，一在於一切成長者對弱小能特別寄以同情。</p>
<p>惟人類之同情時爲內在心理及外在環境所轉移。內在心理如權力慾·越感·恒足以使人變爲殘忍，變爲不屑對弱小及苦難同情。拉丁詩人路庫里特嘗稱：「在狂風起波浪時，站在岸上看到人在苦難中掙扎，是一件愉快的事」，大哲學家斯賓諾莎嘗捉蚊蠅。置蛛網。觀其被呑食以為樂，尼米主張强者促成弱者滅亡，以盡其責任，皆其明證。在環境方面，如愚昧·貧窮·饑饉。戰爭，亦足以使人變爲冷酷無情。羅馬人使人與獸鬥殺。西班牙人使獸與獸鬥殺以爲娛樂。斯巴達人殘殺弱嬰。在中國有的地方盛行溺女，視爲固然，在貧窮饑饉時賣兒鬻女，甚至易子而食，在戰爭逃亡時，嬰孩弱小，到處棄擲，皆其明證。羅素在「中國問題」中稱中國「成千成萬在飢荒中待斃，人們爲着幾個錢出賣兒女，賣不出就弄死」，謂中國民族為缺乏同情，爲性格殘忍。殊不知哀憐弱小，人性同有，而愚昧·貧窮·飢飩·戰爭，有時亦確足以使人喪失本性。此次大戰以來，因曠日持久，戰火蔓延，毀壞特甚，犧牲太大，全世界三分之二人民，在砲火逃亡飢饉掙扎中求生，不知不覺使一部份人變爲特別看重經濟，看重現實，及勢利，但知自己掙脫飢寒死亡情景之下，可憐萬千弱小將誰憑依？在逃難遷徙中，乃或者，不免爲成人視爲但能坐食而予以出賣，在舟車上下時，乃或者不免因年輕弱小而被擠落，躑躅街頭，在被擄被賣被拾得後，乃或者不免爲敵人殘殺玩弄，爲生人奴隷或虐殺。一福弱小苦難景色，在無情砲火飢寒中漸次展開，試一留心黃昏街頭，荒村田畔，則傷心故事，幾令人疑已置身地獄人間。夫痛苦則思父母，今欲救弱小於顚危，反冷酷爲溫和，遂天地之失機，，其惟推廣母愛乎？（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c88">蔣主席對參政會發表政治報告　全文（上） <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>蔣主席一日晨對國民參政會發表政治報告，茲誌全文如下：</p>
<p>各位參政員同人：日木投降，抗戰結東，至今已渝半年。政府在此半年之中爭取國際與國內和平的措施，可分爲下列的六項：</p>
<p>爭取內外和平　進行六項措施</p>
<p>（一）爲求世界的和平與安全，與各友邦共同簽署聯合國憲章，促成聯合國組織，參加安全理事會，以期重建國際正義與法律的秩序。（二）爲求國家四鄰親睦，四境安定與有關各國共謀邊疆懸案的解決，將以中蘇友好同盟條約的訂立，使邊境毘迎的兩大國家獲到和平合作之道。（三）爲求國內各民族的自由平等，對於省區外各民族，具體自治的能力與獨立的意志，而在經濟上。政治上達到了可以獨立程度之時，扶助其獨立目治。對於省區以內各民族，在政治上。法律上一律予以平等，在信仰上·經濟上，亦予以充分自由。（四）爲求國內社會秩序的安定，黨派紛爭的止息，並提早訓政的結束與憲政的實施，本於「政治問題應以政治方法決」的一貫方針，召集政治協商會議，共商召開國民大會的方法，研討憲法草案的原則，並決定在憲政實施之前，擴大國民政府的基礎，要朮各黨派人士及社會賢達共同參加，更擬訂和平建國綱領，以爲此過渡時期施政的準繼。（五爲停止國內軍事衝突，頒發停止衝突，恢復交通的命令，並設立軍事調處執行部，以貫澈停戰命令。（六）爲實施軍事復員計劃，並統編中共獨立軍隊，使其加入國軍，以確保軍隊編制與軍令之統一，由軍事小組會議訂定整編及統編方案，政府對於方案堅守不渝，而其中有關國軍的部份，已依其所定的步驟，切實實施。</p>
<p>上述六項，都是爲尋求和平統一的道路，而努力和平統一的方針如能貫澈，建國的大業就可以順利的進行。和平統一的努力如遭挫折，國家民族的危機也就日甚一日，各位對於這些關係國家存亡的問題，自必予以深切的關懷。外交方面，已由王部長向大會報吿了，政治協商會議的協議，已由邵秘書長報告各位，本席現在要就東北問題最近的發展，新疆的伊寗事變的經過，以及其解決的辦法和政治協商會議憲法草案修正原則商討的經過，簡單說明。</p>
<p>我們知道，東北與新疆問題，對於國家的和平統一，皆有重大的影響，而憲法是國家組織的根本大法。這三個問題是今日中國外交政治最重要的問題，本席認爲有向大會剴切陳述的必要：</p>
<p>東北發展趨勢　為一外交問題</p>
<p>（一）東北問題最近的發展東北問題在本質上是一個外交問題，問題的焦點，在我們中國，國民政府依照中蘇友好同盟條約的精神及附件的規定，接收中國在東北的主權。東北主權接收的經過，已由外交部王部長另作報吿，此刻無須重述，本席要特爲補充的，就是最近中蘇兩國政府交換的又件，蘇聯大使於二月廿二日照曾外交部「蘇聯政府通知中國政府，蘇軍依照政府的決定，本年四月底將自滿洲撤退完畢」，外交部部已於廿七日照覆「中國政府爲謀便利蘇方起見，對於蘇軍於本平四月底自滿洲撤退宛畢，可予同意，請蘇方將蘇軍自各地點撤退之日期通知我方，並於撤退時根據中蘇友好同盟條約的精神，對中國政府換防軍隊予以便利與協助」。外交部王部長又於同日面吿蘇聯大使，「現在距離蘇軍撤完日期尙一月有餘，且束北鐵路縱橫，交通便利，「中國政府軍隊足能於蘇軍撤退以前到達蘇軍所要撤退的各地，請電知東北蘇軍司令部，迅與我軍事代表團董彥平中將商訂交接各地防務的辦法，以便我軍能於接防時獲得蘇方之協助」，這就是中蘇關於東北接收主權問題最近交涉的經過。</p>
<p>本席深信，各位同人聽見了我們報吿以後，對於東北情勢的澄淸，一定懷抱着很大的希望，我們始終認定，中蘇兩國和平合作，不獨是兩國共同的需要，並且是遠東和平，世界安全的基本條件，本席更確信蘇聯之需要和平，以利建設，正與我們中國相同。我們中國必能獲得蘇聯的和平合作，至於一地一事的波折，都不能動搖我們的信心。中蘇兩國和平合作的根據，就是中蘇友好同盟條約及其附件，我們惟有遵守條約及其附件的精神，並期望蘇聯共同踐履條約及其附件的精神，這是中蘇兩國和平合作的基礎，也就是我們兩國對於國東和平。世界安全寳貴的貢獻。</p>
<p>完成接收又前　次無內政可言</p>
<p>其次，談到東北內政問題，我們可以說東北九省在主權的接收沒有完放以前，沒有什麽內政問題可言，如果有人在東北主權沒有收回，外交問題沒有解決期間提出內政問題，作對中央交涉的條件，在這時候必要幼碍我們主權的接收，加重外交的困難，那就不知道他的用意何在了。如果在這蘇外交形勢之下，而國內黨派之中，仍有藉着外交這蘇困難的局勢，來要求政府必要承認他非法的地位和特殊的權利，求得其私人或黨派的利益，而　國家生死存亡於不顧，這種害國殃民的工作，是萬萬做不得的。我們中央對於東北的職責，現在只有接收領土，恢復主權行政的完整，這不僅是政府的責任，並且是國家民族的要求。東北人民在日本侵略軍隊和僞滿統治之下，離開了祖國至十四年之久，他們現在唯一的希望，是中華民國的主權行政能够在東北九省完全行使，讓他們重新受本國法律的保障，做中華民國自由的公民。東北人民在國家主權恢復行政完整的時候，自能依國家的法令，當然享有地方自治之權，但是現在東北眞正愛國的同胞，誰都不願在這個時候，藉地方自治的名義，來阻碍政府的接收主權，分裂東北的領土，這是出於他們愛國至誠的願望，我們萬不能辜負他們的。</p>
<p>國民黨在東北　奮鬥了十四年</p>
<p>十四年來東北軍民在中國國民黨黨員領導之下，武裝反抗日本侵佔和壓迫，因而犧牲者，自九一八至日軍投降之日止，這十四年之間，死亡與被囚的人數，除了十餘萬軍隊官兵不計外，而中國國民黨所犧牲的幹部張濤，韋仲達，于中和，蕙達山等。乃達一千四百三十二人之多。常時日本和偽滿的控制，是一天一天的加强，民衆武裝活動和同志們地下工作，也一天一天的困難，但是到了日本投降的時候，吉林，長春，哈爾濱的日僞監獄出獄的中國國民黨黨員，還有二千七百人。試問共產黨籍的黨員，究有幾人？東北人民對於中國國民黨的信任，中國國民黨黨員在東北艱苦奮鬥的成績，這些數目字，就是最確切的證明。</p>
<p>在日本佔領控制東北的時期，共產黨並沒有什麽武裝力理，自日本投降以後，東北纔有中共部隊的發現，從熱河方面開進東北的中共部隊，在持有少數武器自烟台渡海的中共部隊，那都是徒手過去的，這幾種部隊，合起來就是他們所謂「民主聯軍」，現在他們惟一的工作，就是妨害政府軍隊接收主權，要求特殊化的政一治局面，要知道阻礙國家主權的接收，就是妨害中蘇友好同盟條的的實行，也就是威脅遠東和平與世界安全，我們國民政府爲了國家主權，爲了國際和平，對於共產黨所謂「民主聯軍」這樣阻碍接收主權的行動和他所謂「民選政府」的非泆組織，我們政府和人已決不能承認的。如其果能照整編與統編方案實踐履行，而不妨碍政府接收主權的行動，那我們政府有以與人爲善之心，應予以正大光明的出路和効忠祖國的機會，這是我們對東北問題必須明白認識，確實把握的一點。</p>
<p>本年一月十日，政府代表與中共代表在馬歇爾將軍協助之下，共同聲明停止衝突恢復交通的辦法，規定「停止衝突命令第二節對於國民政府軍隊爲恢復主權而開入柬北九省，或在東北九省境內調動，並不影響」這個條款，就是根據上述的認識而成立，至今仍然有效，然而東北的中共部隊、現在在東北各地阻碍政府接收主權的行動，層出不窮，引起武裝衝突，破壞地方的社會秩序、損害人民的生命財產，這是我們非常痛心的事情。國民政府顧慮地方的疾苦，希望軍事調處執行部愼選執行小組，派赴東北，停止當地的軍事衝突。自上月十一日馬歇爾將軍向軍事三人小組會議提議開始，至上月廿七日止，經過多次會議，乃成立協議。在下列條件之下，由軍事調處執行部愼選執行小組，前往不北，（一）小組之任務，僅限於軍事調處工作，（二）小組應在政府軍隊及中共軍隊地區工作，並避免進入仍為蘇軍駐留之地區，（三）小組應前往衝突地點，或政府軍與中共軍密接地點，使其停止衝突，並作必要及公平之調處，各方另同意關於東北軍事問題由三人會議繼續商談，關於政治問題，則另行商談，迅求解決。</p>
<p>和平奮鬥團結　處理東北共軍</p>
<p>我在此要加說明的，就是中共代表在最後幾次會議之中，他特別提出其要求記錄事項的，「政府應保證依照政治協商會議所定之方式與中共商談有關東北政治事項過渡時期之辦法，政府汝認目前民選之地方政府不加干涉，或妨碍，以待政治問題之解決。」據此，就可明知中共代表之意見，顯然要使他東北共黨部隊所謂「民主聯軍」及其非法製造的所謂「民選政府」的名義來妨碍政府接收主權的企圖取得他合作的根據，政府代表自不能予以同意，且已予以斷然的拒絕，這是會議經過重要之點，故有向大會申述的必要。其次，就是政府對東北問題所取的方針，政府對於東北九省只有接收主權，推行國家的行政權力，軍事衝突的調處祇在不影響政府接收主權行使國家行政權力的前提之下進行。至於遠背東北人民意志，妨碍東北主權行政的一切非法政權，更不是國民政府和全國人民所能承認。我們對於東北的中共部隊，希望他們停止蹂躪民衆，強制民衆，偽程民意，妨害國家主權行政的行爲，尤希望他們接受統編方案，加入國軍，爲國家民族努力服務。我們始終確信，愛國家，愛民族的心情，爲中國人所同具，我們應以和平奮鬥團結一致的精神來處理東北中共部隊的問題，我們深信這是解決東北問題惟一正確的方法。（中央社重慶三日電，全文未完）。</p>

<p>— 本報瀋陽航訊　特派員韓清濤</p>
<p>一列兵車，走在過去的「南滿路」現在的「中長」路上，是我們史無前例的一件大事！</p>
<p>「南滿路」過去給我們的威脅太大了，不知多少人挨過日兵和日警的拳打脚踢，也不知有多少人喪失了生命。九一八事變，也由日人製造所謂「爆破事件」而起。</p>
<p>能者搭乘這列從瀋陽到鐵嶺兵車北上，先在皇姑屯裝好了車，然後拖向「中長路」瀋陽站，再開車就是在中長路上前進了，第一個觸進眼簾的是日人炸死張作霖的大　，北寗路就從橋下通向瀋陽總告</p>
<p>「北大營」在　、一場　的低倭樹羣，引向幾幢大樓房，僞滿國軍，在這裏受過訓練，就在這段鐵道旁日人塑立了一個表示爆炸鐵軌的建築物。此外還有一常碑，日本軍閥的無恥，在今天看起來，倒是相當可憐了！</p>
<p>北大營的北方北有一個規模極大的工廠，據云周圍三四十里，它的名字是一九一八工廠」，是製造輕型坦克的。……日人所搬演亡我東北的傑作。一幕幕的在眼前閃現。</p>
<p>工廠烟囱不冒烟</p>
<p>工人希望能早日復工</p>
<p>雙綫的鐵路，是那蘇的通行無　，沿途不停的飛馳，時常迎頭的跑過一外車來，隨着就從身邊閃過了，瀋鐵間一百二十里的距離，兩個鐘頭就到了。</p>
<p>鐵嶺是一個市，人口五萬多。沿車站一帶，多新建築物，街道也寬敞，從前是日人的居住區域，理在多在臨門閉戶，一切隨時代而演忌。</p>
<p>城區，　通狹，滿街泥水，要從那裹過，得要穿着長統膠靴了一些大商店，多在這些街道上。記者到鐵嶺，是國軍進駐鐵嶺的第三天，鐵嶺的市面，已經一切如常了。</p>
<p>鐵嶺原有大工廠十餘處，小工廠二十輕金屬，製紙，煉瓦，織布等廠，同時日人因鞍山鍊鋼廠時爲我方轟炸目標，故擬在鐵嶺成立鍊鋼分廠，尙未竣工，已經投擊。</p>
<p>所有工廠的機械，除了蘇軍搬走大部外，剩下的一小部份被共黨搬到了法庫，所以現在各大工廠的烟囱都不冒烟了。過去鐵嶺除了男工外，一般婦女小孩，大半都在工廠做工，約有兩萬人，現在無工可做了，大家一致　　，能嚴法辦　使幾家能開工的小工廠，早日開工。</p>
<p>耆紳任黑夜巡查</p>
<p>大部韓人改日本姓名</p>
<p>鐵嶺有萬多日僑，過去多爲「滿鐵」職員和各工廠的技術人員，受過「大鼻子」的搜奪和姦汚，同時我們的窮人和琉氓，也乘機奪了些剩餘的東西在「八一三」東北光復的前夕，從監獄釋放出來的我們同胞，每到夜裏在日人區域全圖騷　報服，地方耆紳，認爲不應如此做去，都親率警衛人員，於黑夜中巡察，秩序因而穩定下來。韓國人，全縣有三千人，多是種稻的農人，另一部份是各工廠的工人，大部份改成了日本姓氏，仗勢欺人，無惡不做，同胞受他們害的爲數太多了，今天，我們對他們無所苛求，聽任他們自由居住，大家希望韓國政府，對於這些人有所懲辦。</p>
<p>日僑擬辦歌舞會</p>
<p>國眾謝絕他們的慰勞</p>
<p>距離鐵嶺五里地方，日人花了三四年的時光，造了一座長的二華里的鐵法縣道鋼鐵橋樑，剛剛完工。在投降前夕，他們把它炸毁了，這眞是我們一個損失。　現在，除了少數日僑應徵做工外，有些在靠近車站的一條街上，擺攤賣食品，香烟，不周衣物，維持生活。當記者到的那一天，日僑打算舉辦一個歌舞會，慰勞國軍，國軍當局吿以停留無定，加以謝絕了。</p>
<p>「滿鐵醫院」是鐵嶺一個完善的醫院，有最好的愛克司光綫等設備，目前有日醫師廿一人，日婦女看護數十人，及日慕職員十餘人，照常工作。除了麻醉和退熱劑外，藥品也十分完全。每天到那裏看病的中日人民很多。</p>
<p>當地政治我演變</p>
<p>八路軍帶走人　甚夥</p>
<p>據一個地方上的老者吿訴記者說：「八，一五」光復後，鐵嵌陷於混亂狀態，曾組織了一個臨時縣政維持會，維持治安，縣府未走職員一百多人，都照常辦公。維持會的委員長是前僞滿鐵嶺縣長莊紹裕，副委員長是前僞滿鐵嶺市長張競擇，還有一個地方耆紳王者貴，也被推當了個副委員長。</p>
<p>蘇軍到達鐵嶺，是八月廿二日，除了日人外，我們也有許多損害，後共軍來了，委派的縣長是劉渭東，對人民尙好。此次共軍退出鐵嶺，劉渭東隨着走了，同時幷帶走了莊紹裕，另外有好多人隨八路軍走了。裏面多是失業的工人，還有幾個敎員，共軍初到　　時，曾强迫地方人入伍，所以帶走的數目相當大。</p>
<p>在共軍沒到前，會有兩個國民黨部在爭收黨最，幷作猛烈的相互拚擊，內中一個不擇手段的把流氓收入了，八路軍來了，這批流氓又改投入八路軍，他們在僞滿時曾當過特務腿子，國軍到了，那兩個黨部，還有爭執，所以造成這個現象的原因，據云一個是原在該地工作　捕入獄者，光復後得到了釋放，一個是以爲前者被難而新　來者。</p>
<p>新任鐵嶺市長兼縣長李桂庭，姗姗來遲，國軍進駐鐵嶺的第四天，纔有消息可從瀋陽到達鐵嶺，該地軍事負賣人認爲這樣的作風很失敗，所以又特急電瀋陽轉知開原，四平街等地行政負責人，隨軍前往接收，以免間斷政務。</p>
<p>八里莊戰役慘烈</p>
<p>八十九團副團長受傷</p>
<p>國軍向鐵嶺方面的擴展，是三月十九日從瀋陽北文官屯車站開始的，沿途行軍極感困難，因橋樣被八路軍破壞了，同時還有很深融化的泥永。廿三日晨，到達距鐵這五六里地方。上午九時半，開始與共軍接觸，左翼打了二個半鐘頭，即攻下頭台子，二台了，右翼至廿四日晨七時，攻下八里莊。</p>
<p>八里莊的戰役，相當激烈，國軍方面八九團副團長羅順輔受傷，另外士兵傷亡的有卅多人，俘獲了共軍八十三人，來歷不明的火箭砲六門，及槍枝甚多。據云共軍傷亡慘重，遺屍四百卅一具。</p>
<p>守鐵嶺的共軍，有新四軍廿四旅，遼北省保安軍第十九幽及七十一團，特務第五團，以及鐵嶺保安大隊，共的三千多人。二十三日曾從北開來四列車，係新四軍第旅、，二十四日晨又開來三千多人，甫下火車，即隨退走共軍，共同退往山地和村鎭了。</p>
<p>聯合中學已開課</p>
<p>學生們散處四鄕未返</p>
<p>鐵嶺的一切，已經平定下來，聯合中學開課了，學是在鐵嶺現有的兩個男婦，一個女中，六百多學生的請求，原有學生一千多人，好多的散處在四鄕，一時來不了。</p>
<p>當記者去參觀的時候，一個敎室在上作文課，先生已經在黑板上出了一個「慰問國軍文」的題目，學生們正在提筆構思，繼而參觀了一個衛生室，裏面有紫外綫等設備。據該校敎員云：其他設備，也顱齊全，可惜現在不完整了。</p>
<p>小學原有九國，當記者在鐵嶺的時候，還未開學，中學的敎員，多係爲了鄕梓靑年教育，暂時採取盡義務辦法，市縣接收後，當可有新的決定。</p>
<p>鐵嶺的物價，在吃食方面，還算相當低，布疋則高過了上海。一般的說起來，「八一五」光復後物價陸續上漲了四五倍，大米公斤三十元，土粉滿制斤二十五元，豬肉二十八元，小米四元五角，包谷粉三元五角，白菜由一元至一元五角。按滿制斤合內地十五兩，法幣官價十三元換東北流通券僞滿鈔一元，又紅軍票與東北流通券同値。</p>
<p>鐵嶺的人士，股盼派好的市縣長來，利用未走的市縣府職員。推行好的縣政，以謀恢復鐵嶺的繁榮。新任市縣長們，萬萬不能忽略了這一點！（三月二十八日，瀋陽。）</p>

<h3 id="c90">一個出口商人 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— 楊車儀</p>
<p>當局為管理外匯起見，所有出口貨物的外匯，須由指定銀行購買，這對於國家經濟無疑是有限大裨益的。但為工商業前途計，絕對不能增加商人的負担和困難，若非有完善辦法，就雖免顧此失彼。本人有幾點竟見，貢獻於有關當局。</p>
<p>按現在實行管理外匯的辦法，商人所有出口貨物，須將提貨單委託指定銀行押匯，貨物到達國外時，國外進口商人必須預備貨物總殖外幣，向銀行贖取提貨單，才能够提領貨物。照上述情形，商人需要有兩份資金，然後能够作一次出口經營，因爲一份資金在國內採辦貨物，一份資金在國外　取提單，雖然可又將貨物抵押，向銀行借貸一部份款項，但以現在高昂之利息，決不是出口商人所能負担的。</p>
<p>最近物價與外匯不能平行，出口實無利可圖，加以上述種種困難，勢必使殘存之出口商人，裏足不前，將資本移作投機事業。對于建國大計，影響甚大，實有改良之必要。</p>
<p>按管理外匯，各國在戰爭初期，早已經實行，如英屬馬來亞等地，凡出口貨物，須具銀行保證，出品商人決於六個月內將貨值外匯托該銀行匯返原地，即可獲得出口之准許。戰前日本，凡出口貨物，委託銀行押匯，經過銀行調查完畢，認為股實可就，光將全數款項，貸與出口商人，免息或取最低利息，貨物到達國外領取提單，但必須要將貨總值於一個月內付還與銀行。按前項辦法，旣能管理外　，又不致影響商人之資金和業務，手續便利，困難减少，後者更是鼓勵出口提倡生產之是好辦法。上列兩項辦法，大抵輕便易行，特提出以供我賢明當局之硏討與採用。（上）國軍接收遼寧兵工廠後防禦正門（下）瀋陽郊外冰雪情景</p>

<p>自殺這一行為，似乎為萬物之靈的人類社會所獨有，而在一般的動物社會則並不存在。這，大概是因為動物到底是動物，頭腦簡單，毫無智識，祗有被害，還沒有想到自殺之故吧。</p>
<p>可是，就在人類社會當中，似乎也不能一概而論。事實告訴我們：在所謂文明社會裏，自殺這事情的發生，顯然要比未開化或半開化的社會來得多。所以，倘有人要把自殺認作近代文明社會所帶來的「惡性流行病」之一，我看，是可以說得通的。</p>
<p>正因為如此，所以，自殺，在近代，也就漸漸地成了社會問題之一，時常被加以研究和探討。</p>
<p>一般地說來，對於自殺，在目前，至少存在着兩種不同的看法。一種，認為自殺乃是勇敢的行為，乃是異常認真，固執，不願因循，苟且，敷衍的結果。另一種，則恰好相反，認為自殺乃是怯懦的表現，乃是不敢正視現實，克服現實，沒有勇氣生活下去的證據。對於同一的自殺行為，爲什麽竟會發生出兩種極端不同的見解呢？我以為：這，完全是出於人們往往從相異的角度去對一種現象加的考察之故。就是說，前者是從個體行為的角度上去看，而後者則是從社會的角度上去看的。</p>
<p>在世界各國當中，自殺最流行的，似乎當首推我們的「芳鄰」日本。可不是嗎？他們的「切腹」「心中」（情死）已經跟他們的櫻花和富士山同樣聞名於世。在日本，個人的自殺不用說，便是全家的「集團自殺」也是司空見慣的専體。東京大阪的報紙，時常都以頭二號的方體黑字來載這類殘酷悲慘的新聞。而每年的自殺人數統計，也動輒以千萬計。就在近代的文人當中，自殺的也很不少。例如頗為國人所知的芥川龍之介氏，有島武郎氏等等，都是自殺而死的。詩人生田春月，似乎也是。</p>
<p>俄國，好像也是「自殺症」頗為流行的國度之一。就先拿文士來說，實行自殺的也頗不乏人。正如大家所曉得的一般，詩人葉賽寗氏，馬耶科夫斯基氏，都是無獨有偶地死於自殺的；甚至高爾基氏在早年也曾自殺過一次，幸而未遂。關於葉氏和馬氏的自殺，其間選有一段著名的小插話。——原來，當葉氏自殺之後，馬氏曾寫過一篇悼念的詩，其詞句是這樣的：這人生死並不艱難；活下去却艱難得多。</p>
<p>從這詩看來，馬氏顯然頗不以葉氏的自殺為然；但，後來馬氏也竟由於種種原因，而重演了跟葉氏相同的悲劇。這不但完全出人意外，就是他自身，在當日，恐怕也完全沒有想到過罷。</p>
<p>咱們中國，在幾個大都會中，特別是被稱為「罪惡淵薮」的上海，服毒投河的新聞，也變成了充實各報社會新聞版的主要資料之一。至於近代名人們呢，則據我所知，明國以來，自尋短見的，舊文人則有詞曲研究專家王國維氏；新文人則有小說家顧仲起氏，和詩人朱湘氏。戲劇家洪深氏，幾年前，出於不堪生活壓迫，也曾吞服多量紅藥水，實行自尋短見，幸而施救得快，并未致死。</p>
<p>連一隻小螞蟻也莫不貪生怕死，人之欲「生」，誰不如我？一個人，求生不得，衹好尋死，天下還有比這種悲慘更值得同情的事情嗎？但同情和贊成並不是同義語。由於自殺究竟是違反人性的社會病態之一，我們是希望它能夠早日完全絕跡的，正如我們希望所有的惡性流行病都能夠早日完全絕跡一樣。</p>
<p>但，要怎樣才能實現我們的希望呢？這自然不是三言兩語所能盡述，衹好略而不諭了。</p>
<p>不過，有一點，倒是千真萬確，那就是：當人們再也不會由於種種原因，而發生「母甯死』之感的時候，試問還有誰個自願找死呢！………</p>

<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>墨老爺道時忽然睜開了眼，他的神思還交雜着「醉」與「夢」的情緒！他環顧周圍，原來自己已躺在書房的床上，（自從麗華誕生那天被太太驅逐以來，一直還沒有和太太同居過。）書案上燃着一雲半明半滅的油燈，麗華伏在書案上「唧唧咕咕」地念着什麽。墨老爺稍稍回想了一下，他記起曾經和翁老爺在一　　個小酒館裏對酌，可是，以後他怎樣的又回到家裏來，就記不清了！</p>
<p>「小華！」麗華聽見墨老爺叫，連忙走過來。</p>
<p>「爸爸，你醒了！」</p>
<p>「嗯！你在作什麽？」</p>
<p>「我在念書，爸爸！剛才你快把我給嚇壞了！翁伯伯送你回來，你醉得連路都不會走，還是墨盛把你抱到床上去的。你一躺下來，就睡着了。」麗華笑着敘述墨老爺醉後的情形。</p>
<p>墨老爺於是才明白了他是這樣回來的。</p>
<p>「你怎麼還不去睡覺？現在什麽時候了？」</p>
<p>「剛敲過十一點鐘。媽看戲還沒有回來。哥哥去睡覺了，我怕你醒了要喝水，所以不敢走開。爸爸。這會干渴了嗎？」麗華說着一面去倒了一盌茶遞給墨老爺。</p>
<p>墨老爺喝了幾口水。又感動又煩惱地緊緊握住麗華的手。他感動的是，這麼一個小孩子，她懂得盡孝道？她知道愛護他。同時他煩惱的是，墨太太居然一個人去看戲了，而且這樣晚還不回來，準又是同翁太太在一起。想到這裏，他漸漸恢復了記憶——他記得就是為了翁太太的問題，他才約了翁老爺去喝酒，也是為了翁太太的問題，他才醉了。他記得翁老爺表示他解決不了這問題，也不願去深究。還權過他應當把一切當作夢看，對於夢，是無須乎去認真的，但是他現在頗不以為然。他明明看見了這些擺在眼前的事實，並非夢！這些事實，却深深地刺激着他，折磨着他，他不可能永遠像醉時那樣，麻痹地忍受一切！</p>
<p>像是一把火，燃燒了墨老爺的心臟，他感覺着渾身熱得發慌！肺腔裏宛如有無數的蛆虫在　他，他急促地咳嗽着，嗆出了許多的痰。</p>
<p>「爸爸！快喝口水呷呷吧！別再吃酒了，瞧又咳嗽起來了！」麗華說罷，又倒了一盌茶喂墨老爺。</p>
<p>墨老爺沒有說什麽，他只緊緊地握住麗華的小手不放，他的喉嚨裏像有千言萬語，阻梗着不知從何說起，只用眼睛乞憐地呆看着麗華。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Over Four Hundred Reporters Travel to Cover the Public Trial of Top Traitor; Chen Pens a 60,000-Word Confession; Verdict May Be Announced Next Week After Court Hearing <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Suzhou Correspondent, 11:30 PM, 4th] The warm and bright weather brings joy to people, and the public trial of Chen Gongbo, the leading traitor, is sure to bring infinite excitement to those concerned. In recent days, the focus of conversation in the streets, alleys, taverns, and teahouses has been on this event. Reporters specially sent by various newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai to Suzhou for coverage have reached 455. Most of them are staying at the Le Xiang Hotel, and many citizens are flocking there to inquire about news, making the hotel no less than a news agency. The Suzhou newspapers hosted a reception this morning to show camaraderie among colleagues. In addition to reporters from various newspapers, "China Electric" and "China Film" have also specially sent personnel to Suzhou for photography and recording, totaling about 40 photography technicians. Originally, the Suzhou Power Plant generated electricity from 5:00 PM daily, but after repeated negotiations between "China Electric" and the High Court with the power plant, they agreed to generate electricity from 2:30 PM, but the power plant requested a subsidy for coal costs. More than 20 "China Electric" photographers and technicians spent this afternoon arranging lighting in the First Criminal Court and testing the light intensity, and everything is ready.</p>
<p>The trial will open at 3:30 PM on the 5th, and the High Court has completed all preparations. The public gallery in the First Criminal Court originally could only accommodate just over 140 people, but it has now been expanded. As of the time this telegram was sent by the reporter, more than 260 admission tickets have been issued. Although the High Court had previously announced that it would stop issuing tickets, special arrangements can still be made for important personnel to attend. Currently, long lines are arranged outside the courtroom to accommodate attendees. The High Court has also specifically stipulated that reporters are prohibited from running around arbitrarily to avoid interfering with photography and court order. It is reported that Chen Gongbo's son has come to Suzhou to attend the hearing, and the Military Affairs Commission has also sent important personnel.</p>
<p>The presiding judges have been decided: Sun Honglin, President of the High Court, will serve as the presiding judge; Shi Meiyu will be the chief judge; Chen Jiarui will be the associate judge; and Han Su will be the chief prosecutor. Yang, the clerk of the High Court, will continue to serve as the clerk. Yang has been extremely busy these past few days, dealing with various arrangements, and feels like he has no time to eat.</p>
<p>Regarding security, 21 armed court police officers are deployed. Six men led by Suzhou Police Chief Su Zimin are responsible for escorting Chen, four men are on guard in court, three men are monitoring the court order, and four men are guarding outside the court. Chen was originally planned to be transported from the detention center to the court by car, but it has now been decided to use an armored vehicle. It is expected that when the vehicle passes, tens of thousands of people will crowd the streets to see what fate awaits this great traitor. Chen has not hired a lawyer and is only represented by Gao Rong, a court-appointed lawyer designated by the court. It is reported that Chen has written a confession in prison, about 60,000 words long, and has also written two briefs of defense, which were submitted to the High Court a few days ago. In prison, Chen occasionally wrote poems to express himself, but the rhymes are poor, and the tones are discordant. In addition, the Military Affairs Commission has sent a sound film taken when the puppet government was established, which may be shown if necessary.</p>
<p>Chu, also a Traitor, Will Stand Trial with Chen's Wife; Trial Period Around Mid-Month</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Suzhou, 4th] Chen has been interrogated three times by the Suzhou High Court Prosecutor's Office, and the chief prosecutor has collected two boxes of evidence of Chen's planning to organize a puppet government and collude with the enemy. Therefore, this trial of Chen will be much more convenient. According to reporters, after Chen's trial tomorrow, a verdict may be announced on the 11th of this month. Furthermore: Chu Minyi and Chen Bi jun, Chen's wife, will be tried at the Suzhou High Court in mid-month, following Chen's case. The time will likely be on the 15th and 16th. Lin Baisheng, the former puppet propaganda minister, has not been sent to Suzhou and is still detained in Nanjing. It is said that he will no longer be sent to Suzhou and will be tried by the Nanjing court. According to Shi Meiyu, presiding judge, the verdict for Miao Bin, which will be announced on the 8th, will be based not only on the law but also on public opinion. As for Zhang Beisheng, whose case has been remanded for retrial, the main point of the retrial is only whether the crime of "selling a friend for personal gain" by betraying Ma Yuanfang is established. The other crimes of clearing villages, blockading areas, and recruiting and training puppet troops still stand. These crimes alone are enough for him to receive the same sentence as previously handed down.</p>
<p>[Further Telegram] This morning, the reporter went to the Suzhou High Court. Presiding Judge Sun Honglin was sitting in the president's office, studying the piles of documents of this major traitor's case. Next to the case was a phonograph and several records, which will be important evidence during tomorrow's trial of the traitor. These records were obtained from the enemy by our side and contain a recording of Chen's speech on the third anniversary of the founding of the puppet Manchukuo in Changchun.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 4th] Shi Meiyu, Presiding Judge and concurrently President of the Nanjing Military Tribunal, spends three days in Suzhou and three days in Nanjing each week. When trying Miao Bin, he requested Miao to be a witness for the Military Tribunal, and Miao readily agreed.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing Special Dispatch, 4th] Since September 26th of last year, the following traitors have been successively arrested in Nanjing: Chen Zhishuo, Pan Zeyuan, Hua Zexi, Xia Guoqiang, Xu Yizong, Dai Shubei, Qian Sen, Yao Gang, Deng Mo, Yang Jianzhong, Ling Feng, Wu Huidong, Yang Zhen, Gu Dazhuang, Zheng Duoqiu, Lang Zumiao, He Daoqian, Xia Changzu, Chen Baoting, Liu Kaifa, Shen Xiuwen, Guo Duting, Du Bing, Wang Chunhe, Mei Yongkui, Wu Weishe, Zhang Bingquan, and 32 others. They will be transferred to the Capital High Court Prison tomorrow (5th) to await trial. Chen Zhishuo once served as the Deputy Minister of the Puppet Ministry of Finance, concurrently Director of the Puppet Finance Specialized Committee, Political Counselor of the Puppet Executive Yuan, and Secretary-General of the Puppet Enemy Property Committee, among other important puppet positions. Pan Zeyuan once served as the Chief of Staff of the Puppet Guard Division and the Puppet Garrison Headquarters. Hua Zexi once served as the Adjutant of the Puppet Guard Division. Chen Changzu once served as a Lieutenant General Military Advisor in the puppet army. It is reported that Pan, Hua, and others will be transferred to military judicial organs for trial.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 4th] Hundreds of important traitors in Shandong Province have been arrested by the competent authorities. Preliminary investigations have been completed, and they have been transferred to the High Court here and will be publicly tried in the near future.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 4th] In order to expedite the trial of traitors, the Hebei High Court has temporarily suspended handling ordinary criminal cases and has established a special Second Criminal Court to handle traitor cases, with Feng Po as the presiding judge. As soon as the traitor-arresting authorities transfer the traitors to the court, trials can begin. Furthermore, Chen Xiufu, the former head of the Puppet Shanghai Education Bureau, was arrested here the day before yesterday. The traitor Chen was hiding at No. 6, Xiaotudimiao, Dongdan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 4th] Jiangxi is currently carrying out a traitor purge. More than 300 people have been arrested and sent to court for trial. Most of these traitors are responsible persons of the puppet maintenance societies in Fengxin, Anyi, and other counties in northwestern Jiangxi, or secret agents who spied on military intelligence for the enemy. Zhou Guanhong, the acting chairman of the puppet Jiangxi Provincial Government, has also been imprisoned and will be sent to court by the organizing authorities.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Suzhou, 4th] Traitors from Jiangsu Province are currently being concentrated in Suzhou to await trial. The Jiangsu High Court Detention Center currently holds more than 800 traitors transferred from Nanjing and various parts of Jiangsu Province, including ten female traitors. In addition, there are more than 300 criminals who have committed crimes endangering the Republic of China, all of whom will be tried and sentenced. Wang Weizheng, the warden of the detention center, has very strict internal management, and the order is quite good.</p>

<h3 id="e4">Beiping Martyrs' Shrine Completed; Enshrinement Ceremony Today <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 4th] The Martyred Spirit Tower, originally built by the Japanese in the western suburbs, has been rebuilt into a Martyrs' Shrine by the Beiping Municipal Government after the restoration. It is scheduled to be completed tomorrow, the 5th, and a ceremony will be held at the same time to enshrine the martyrs who died in the war against the enemy, including Zhang Zizhong, Tong Linge, and Zhao Dengyu. Director Li Xiong of the municipal government will participate in the grand ceremony tomorrow. The Martyred Spirit Tower was originally built by the Japanese invaders to commemorate their fallen soldiers who invaded China. The tower is located at the foot of Babao Mountain in the western suburbs of Beiping. The construction requisitioned 540 acres of land, and the main structure was built with granite and concrete transported from outside the pass. During the construction, 10,000 people worked daily, and it took three years to complete. The construction cost 1 billion yuan. The Japanese initially did not expect that this extravagant resting place for the aggressive souls would one day be taken over by the anti-Japanese loyal souls of Zhang Zizhong and others.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Five Arrested Communists Released in Beiping <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Military Police Authorities Inspect Households</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 4th] Five communist personnel have been released after being arrested. One of them is affiliated with the Communist Party personnel in the Mediation Executive Department. The forty-two staff members of "Xinhua News Agency" and "Liberation Daily" remain in custody. It is reported that Ye Jianying has made six demands: (1) The searchers should be punished, (2) the military authorities and the Beiping Municipal Government should publish an apology in the newspaper, (3) compensation for losses, (4) guarantee that there will be no such incidents again, (5) all arrested persons should be released unconditionally, and (6) the newspaper office should be opened immediately.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 3rd] The atmosphere here suddenly became tense. Last night, military and police authorities inspected households. The Beiping branch of Xinhua News Agency at No. 9, Fanghuzhai, the distribution department of Liberation Daily at No. 42, Sandaozhalan, and the office of the 18th Army Group at No. 11, Qianjingxiandao, were all inspected. This morning, 48 CCP personnel from the three locations were taken to the Second Police Station outside and the Fourth Police Station inside for questioning. At 7:30 tonight, the Communist side hosted reporters. Sheng Daiyuan, Deputy Chief of Staff of the 18th Army Group on the Communist side, said: He had gone to the Beiping Garrison Headquarters and the Eleventh War Zone Commander's Office of the Municipal Government to inquire, and all the authorities claimed that they did not know about this matter in advance and promised to investigate. This morning, those who were taken to the police station for questioning included 29 people from Xinhua News Agency at Fanghuzhai, including Jiang Jichen and Yang Xiaogeng, 13 people from Liberation Daily at Sandaozhalan, including Deputy Manager Ma Jianmin, and Sheng Daiyuan's secretary, his wife, and daughter from the office of the 18th Army Group at Qianjingxiandao.

It is understood that this afternoon, Rao Junrui, the director of the Beiping branch of Xinhua News Agency, went to the Second Police Station outside to inquire. The police station asked Rao to make a guarantee so that the people taken to the station could be released, but the CCP personnel refused.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Provincial Autonomy Law Discussed by Special Committee; Political Consultative Conference Subgroup Continues Meeting; Youth Party Agrees to Attend After Mediation <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 4th] The joint meeting of the Political Consultative Conference's Comprehensive Subgroup and the Constitutional Draft Review Committee continued yesterday. Representatives from the Youth Party did not attend, but discussions continued as usual. Regarding whether the provincial autonomy law must be passed by the Legislative Yuan, and the entire political issue of central devolution of power versus local balance of power, if the true meaning of local balance of power is clearly defined and determined, then the question of whether the Legislative Yuan has the right to pass the provincial autonomy law can be easily resolved. Therefore, Wang Chonghui, Zhang Junmai, Qin Bangxian, Chen Qitian, Wang Yunwu and others were immediately appointed to form a special committee to study this issue. The committee is scheduled to meet this afternoon. Regarding the absence of representatives from the Youth Party, Sun Ke, Zhang Junmai, and others went to persuade them yesterday in their personal capacity, and all major issues were scheduled to be discussed at another meeting at 2:00 PM tomorrow (5th).</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 4th] At the meeting of the Political Consultative Conference's Comprehensive Subgroup, a spokesperson for the Chinese Youth Party stated that the Youth Party has always embraced the spirit of "mutual forbearance for the sake of the country" towards the Political Consultative Conference, seeking to enhance unity. The incident of one day was truly regrettable, but after mediation by Mr. Sun Zhesheng, Shao Lizi, Zhang Junmai, Wang Yunwu, and others, we are unwilling to dwell on it, so we will continue to attend the meeting as usual, hoping to complete the task entrusted by the conference as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Administrative Heads of Electoral Districts Should Not Be Elected National Assembly Representatives <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Executive Yuan Answers Inquiry from Political Council</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 4th] Regarding the question of whether National Assembly representatives should also hold official positions, which was raised by someone in the Political Council a few days ago, the Executive Yuan has now formally responded with the following reasons: The National Assembly is organized by the people, and government officials also have national identity. If they are supported by the voters, there is no reason why they cannot be elected and also serve as National Assembly representatives. For example, the members of the British cabinet are entirely composed of members of Parliament elected by the people, and most other countries also have no restrictions on people's representatives also holding official positions. China's situation is unique, and the Premier's will has clear provisions on this. In order to prevent officials from manipulating the elections, during the last election of National Assembly representatives, it was specifically restricted that the administrative heads serving in the electoral district could not be elected as National Assembly representatives of that district, in order to strike a balance.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 4th] The Hubei Provincial Government recently received a telegram from Chairman Chiang ordering improvements to the military grain procurement methods. The main points are as follows: (A) The purchase price should be based on the average market price on March 15th, (B) Large grain merchants should be targeted to purchase all their surplus grain, (C) Freight should be given appropriately, (D) Procedural formalities should be as simple, quick, and fair as possible, (E) The military grain procurement committee should be reorganized. The provincial government is currently complying with these instructions separately.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] The Ministry of Food is very optimistic about suppressing grain prices, because the methods of procuring military grain have now been improved. The supply of military grain in various places along the Yangtze River is decreasing daily because most of the troops have begun demobilization and reorganization, as well as transfers. Moreover, the weather has cleared in recent days, making rice transportation easier, and the supply is becoming smoother every day. Grain prices in Nanjing have begun to weaken.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 4th Broadcast: The Security Council's stalemate may be broken. At an informal meeting of members last night, unanimous agreement was reached to accept the Soviet Union's guarantee to withdraw troops before May 6. All parties believe that this agreement is the Security Council's unprecedented great achievement.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 4th Broadcast: The Security Council convened on time today. Soviet representative Gromyko did not attend. U.S. Representative Stettinius proposed that since the Soviet Union has guaranteed that its troops will withdraw from Iran, the Council should postpone discussion of the Iranian issue until after May 6. After May 6, the governments of the Soviet Union and Iran should report to the Council whether the withdrawal has been completed, but within this period, if the Soviet Union, Iran, or any member of the Council reports that some development will hinder the withdrawal of Soviet troops, the Council should discuss it immediately. The Egyptian representative agreed with Stettinius' proposal and praised the Soviet Union's spirit of adhering to the Council's resolution. The Egyptian representative also stated: "We deeply hope that the world is now convinced that this only institution for maintaining peace is still strong and vigorous." Subsequently, representatives from the United Kingdom, France, Brazil, Egypt, Poland, and Mexico also agreed with the U.S. representative's suggestion, while the Australian representative abstained from voting. It is said that the Iranian issue was a challenge to the Security Council, and now the Security Council could not cope with it. The Soviet representative's withdrawal from the meeting was regrettable.

We still hope that your country can understand this." Molotov also said: "We understand Iran, we know that Iran wants to move forward on the road to progress.

We are prepared to assist all small countries." Molotov then patted Sadar on the back and said: "No delegation has a mission as important as yours. We will help you become strong.

<p>Yesterday, the *North China Daily News* published an article entitled "The Future of Private Enterprises," stating: "Although China is currently actively engaged in recovery, according to observations by figures in the production sector, the outlook for private enterprises in the short term is not optimistic. It is said that Chinese private enterprises once enjoyed the advantages of cheap labor and ample raw materials, but are now suffering from fierce competition from state-owned enterprises and government-subsidized enterprises, as well as competition from inexpensive and high-quality imports from abroad. China, having experienced years of war, is facing a shortage of raw materials, and the continued increase in production and transportation costs is putting private enterprises in a competition with government-operated enterprises that is bound to fail. The fact that most private enterprises need to borrow money from the government is enough to show that they are facing a serious crisis, and a return to normalcy seems unlikely in the near future." Although this is a foreign assessment, it is not far from the mark as an observation of the future of Chinese private enterprises.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the seven months since the surrender of the Japanese invaders, recovery and national reconstruction have become commonplace slogans. Although this period is not very long, if we try to think about what achievements have been made in these seven months, we cannot help but feel deeply moved. National reconstruction and recovery cannot be achieved merely by empty talk; there must be concrete facts, there must be accomplishments through action. Private enterprises, unfettered by cumbersome political institutions, should be full of vitality and marching towards recovery and reconstruction at this time of victorious nation-building. However, in the past few months, the situation has been such that private enterprises have not only failed to fully exert their vitality to dedicate themselves to recovery and reconstruction, but have instead shown a state of decline and stagnation. If this situation is allowed to persist without any attempt to remedy it, then it is unknown when recovery and reconstruction will be achieved, and the prospect of China's industrialization is unimaginable!</p>
<p>The formation of this situation is due to multiple causes. Broadly speaking, it stems from the government's indecisive policies towards private enterprises, which has led to a wait-and-see attitude among the people, and a reluctance to move forward. Although the current turbulent domestic political situation is also sufficient to deter general investors from taking risks, the people have some confidence in the evolution of the political situation, that no matter how rampant the Chinese Communist Party may be, the political situation in China will mostly rely on the efforts of the Kuomintang to stabilize it. What they deeply regret now is that the practices of the Kuomintang officials in charge are somewhat baffling to them. Although the Kuomintang's political program and policies have explicit provisions to protect private enterprises, and regulations to delineate the boundaries between state-owned and private enterprises, in reality, policy is policy, and action is action, and the two seem to have no connection. As for the doctrines taught in party ideology and civic education, that is one thing, but the methods adopted in actual governance are another. Because of this contradiction, private enterprises feel that they have no way out, and some pitiful national capitalists—hardly capitalists at all—have therefore failed to unleash their vitality, and recovery and construction are inevitably stalled.</p>
<p>To cite two recent examples: First, the establishment of the China Textile Corporation (Zhongfang) and the China Silk Corporation (Zhongcan) is said to be a temporary measure, and not a policy of state-owned enterprises expanding and penetrating into the territory of private enterprises; but in reality, the establishment of these companies has government backing and special preferential treatment. For example, the price they pay for fuel is different from that of ordinary factories. In such an unfair competition, where can private enterprises find a way out? Second, the Kuomintang's Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee, on the last day of its meeting, passed Song Ziwen's proposal for emergency measures to accelerate economic recovery, stipulating that labor-management disputes should be mediated and arbitrated by the government, and that strikes and work slowdowns are not allowed without authorization. If arbitration fails, the government may take over the private enterprise. This is indeed a method that the United States has used, but we must first study whether mediation and arbitration can truly be impartial and reasonable. If the result of the arbitration is indeed beyond what the capital side can bear, can the state, after taking over, pay the wages as determined by the arbitration without incurring losses? The state has the power to incur losses, which is of course irrelevant, but how can it force private enterprises to incur losses? If this method is used casually, private enterprises may be taken over by the government at any time. This is probably contrary to the general policy of the government to reward and promote private enterprises within its capabilities. How can the people, under the threat of such policies, muster the courage to dedicate themselves to the development of private enterprises? The fact that it has become increasingly difficult to find buyers for factories being auctioned off in recent times shows this phenomenon. During the war in the United States, private enterprises were still unwilling to accept the government's takeover methods and filed lawsuits to the Supreme Court, arguing that even in times of war, the state had no right to take over private enterprises. The federal government was defeated and the interests of private enterprises were protected. Our country, at the time of the victory of the war against Japan and the reconstruction of the country, needs to support the development of private enterprises in many ways. The implementation of this policy should be carefully considered.</p>
<p>In addition, let us look at the current foreign exchange rate and how it affects domestic production. Calculated at an exchange rate of 2020 legal tender dollars per US dollar, the price increase of imported goods is only 700 times that of pre-war prices. Add to this the considerable devaluation of the US dollar and the duties to be paid, and the price of imported goods is generally not more than 1000 times that of pre-war prices. However, the price of our country's manufactured goods is probably at least 2000 times that of pre-war prices. How can they compete with foreign goods? Not only industrial manufactured goods are like this, but even agricultural products will suffer the same fate. The reason why general yarn factories are competing to buy American cotton and ignoring Shaanxi cotton is because American cotton is cheaper and the delivery dates are accurate, without the trouble of buying Shaanxi cotton. The *North China Daily News* said that private enterprises are suffering from fierce competition from state-owned enterprises on the one hand, and oppression from inexpensive and high-quality imports on the other hand, which truly reveals the location of the disease. Therefore, under this exchange rate, we must, in addition to the exchange rate, find ways to protect our country's private enterprises through tariffs. For industrial products that our country can manufacture, we should encourage the import of their raw materials and block the import of similar manufactured products, so that private enterprises can have some way out.</p>
<p>In short, the post-war recovery and reconstruction of China should prioritize the recovery of production, and the recovery of production cannot do without the cooperation of private enterprises. We would like to earnestly advise the authorities that vision must be far-sighted, and cultivating the wealth of the people is equivalent to increasing the resources of the country. Do not be shortsighted and always have the idea of "competing with the people for profit", and gradually damage the vitality of private enterprises' recovery intentionally or unintentionally. Maintaining law and order, restoring transportation, limiting the scope of state-owned enterprises, and settling labor disputes are all important measures to remove obstacles to private enterprises, and the government should make every effort to achieve these tasks.</p>

<p>Please Strictly Prohibit Raising Silkworm Seed Prices</p>
<p>Farmers in various townships of Wuxing have a strong interest in spring sericulture. However, the rural economy has been ravaged by the enemy and puppets, resulting in an inability to purchase seeds. Although the authorities provide agricultural loans, the amount is very small and does not help. However, some unscrupulous merchants, with the sericulture season approaching, are collecting large quantities of spring seeds, and the black market price for brands such as Tiger, Plum Blossom, and Watermelon is as high as 6,000 to 7,000 yuan per sheet, manipulating profits and disregarding the hardships of farmers. The farmers in the six districts of the county reported to the Party and government agencies in joint names yesterday, ordering them to strictly prohibit and suppress the price of seeds, because the government stipulates that the price of each sheet of spring seed is 500 yuan, but these unscrupulous merchants dare to raise the price, which is detrimental to the countryside.</p>

It is also heard that the bank plans to first lend as much as possible to the counties of Hangjiahu and Zhuji and Sheng County of Shaoxing, where silk production is the most abundant, in order to activate the rural economy and increase farmers' production. As for the silk merchants and cocoon merchants requesting loans, they are of a general commercial nature and the amount required is very large, so they will be handled separately.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Reporters visited the "Executive Relief Administration" yesterday and asked when it would resume selling flour at flat price. According to reports, the agency stopped selling flour from April 1 due to various reasons. As of yesterday, it had not received any orders to continue selling, but it is believed that there will be improved measures announced within days. According to related sources, when general prices in the city rose sharply, the Executive Yuan instructed the authorities in charge of rice, flour, oil, cotton, and cloth in the city to start selling to the city at the same time in order to stabilize prices and tighten the currency. The "Executive Relief Administration" also received orders to start selling flour to the city at a flat price of 6,000 yuan per bag from February 21. By the end of March, the selling price was maintained throughout, and the selling was uninterrupted. Statistics show that 1 million bags of flour have been sold, and the currency has been tightened by as much as 600 billion yuan. According to the "Executive Relief Administration's" flour reserves, there is absolutely no problem in continuing to sell for two or three months, and the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's" flour is still on its way to China. However, that side stated that the six major materials originally instructed by the Executive Yuan must be sold at a flat price at the same time in order to achieve mutual assistance and cooperation.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Triplets Born; Sign of National Prosperity; Family Livelihood Made Even More Difficult <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>On the morning of March 28th, a pregnant woman of Guangdong origin from a poor family was admitted to the Obstetrics Department of the Gongji Hospital. She gave birth that morning, first to a girl, then to a boy, and finally to another girl. The mother and infants are all healthy after childbirth. The infants weigh an average of about three pounds each and are currently being cared for in the hospital. This is truly a sign of national prosperity for the new China. The father of the infants is a shop assistant in a Cantonese-style food store in the city and already has five children. Including the newborns and the couple, the family now has ten members. The difficulty of their livelihood is self-evident. Most countries have regulations for rewarding childbirth, and governments would surely reward a family with triplets. China does not yet have such a system, so we must rely on compassionate assistance from society to enable these infants, who represent national prosperity, to survive healthily. (The photo shows the triplets held in the arms of a nurse).</p>
<h3 id="e56">Notorious Traitors in the "Loyalty" Prison; 21 Ounces of Prison Food Per Day; Sleeping on the Floor; Families Rush to Send Clothes and Bedding <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Entering the solemn gates of the Shanghai Prison, one sees only high walls and iron fences, inevitably conjuring up images of unkempt prisoners spending long years in dark cells, sending a chill down the spine.</p>
<p>Because over seventy notorious traitors have been brought here, the reporter made a special visit to the prison authorities to inquire about them.</p>
<p>These traitors are now all held in the "Loyalty" ward within the prison. The "Loyalty" ward is a five-story cement building with 374 prison cells. Currently, important traitors are held one per cell, while those considered less important are held two or three per cell. Thus, the 374 cells can accommodate about 1,000 prisoners. For security reasons, the number of guards in the "Loyalty" ward is higher than in other wards.</p>
<p>When the traitors were brought in, they all had some money on them, but it is now held in safekeeping by the authorities. There are no beds in the cells. Except for those who are old or sick and have been granted special permission, regardless of whether they were once "Presidents," "Ministers," "Governors," or "Directors," they must now make do with sleeping on the floor, spreading out their bedding to experience this discomfort.</p>
<p>Because of their special circumstances, the traitors in the prison are treated differently from other prisoners. Family members and defense lawyers are not allowed to visit them. However, they are allowed to go outside their cells in batches to walk around during designated times, always under the watchful eyes of the guards.</p>
<p>The prison authorities do not differentiate the traitors from other prisoners when it comes to prison food. The "new rich" who were accustomed to delicacies and fresh fruits now receive the same prison rations as petty thieves: 21 ounces per day, plus vegetables. However, because family members are allowed to bring in changes of clothes and bedding every Thursday, and food every Tuesday and Friday, they do not eat much of the prison food.</p>
<p>With the public trial approaching, the families of the traitors are rushing to hire lawyers and prepare their defense. Thinking back to how they relied on the enemy to oppress and exploit the people, I wonder how they will try to justify their actions. Will they claim to have served the country as undercover operatives?</p>
<p>When leaving, I saw many family members lined up outside the gate to deliver clothes and bedding. Their masters have fallen, their dreams shattered. Countless eyes of soldiers and civilians who sacrificed themselves during the war of resistance are now watching them, and countless hands of suffering compatriots are raised to hold them accountable. Have they finally awakened? (By Mu Ren)</p>
<h3 id="e57">Wage Index Out of Line with Economic Principles; Importance of Changing Customs Should Be Emphasized; Councilors Raise Questions at the Seventh General Assembly <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The Shanghai Provisional City Council held its seventh general assembly yesterday morning at 9:15 AM. Thirty-one councilors were present. Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian presented a summary of the Social Affairs Bureau's work as follows:</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Report:</p>
<p>Economic Administration: (1) Company Registration: To date, 308 cases have been approved and filed. (2) Foreign Company Registration: Because the Foreign Company Law has not yet been promulgated, no registrations have been made. (3) Registration of Various Companies in Recovered Areas: 84 cases of license verification. Industrial and Commercial Registration: To date, 681 applications for registration have been received, covering 11,545 businesses. The registration fee has been reduced from 0.5% to 0.1%. Public Organizations: (1) Industrial and Commercial Associations: Before the war, there were 800,000 organized workers in the city, now there are 500,000 to 600,000 (excluding manual laborers who are not yet organized). There are 400,000 to 500,000 merchants and about 20,000 to 30,000 independent professionals. (2) Seventy labor unions have been reorganized, and 13 social organizations have been established. Labor Administration: (1) Handling Labor Disputes: From September of last year to the end of February, 489 labor disputes involving workers and 860 labor disputes involving shop employees were handled. 1,160 cases have been resolved. (2) Unemployment Relief: Jointly handled by the Ministry of Social Affairs' Special Envoy to Beijing and Shanghai. In August and September of last year, there were over 70,000 unemployed workers, now there are over 30,000 workers. Initially, cash was distributed, but due to its shortcomings, each adult worker now receives one and a half bags of flour per month, and each child worker receives one bag per month. (3) Preparing for labor welfare and organizing a wage review board. The main reasons for labor disputes are: (1) Workers suffered oppression from the enemy puppets for eight years, and are inevitably acting abnormally after liberation. (2) Price fluctuations and unstable living conditions make it difficult to maintain rational control. (3) Most factories are unable to resume operations, leaving workers without livelihood security. Labor disputes can be divided into two types: (1) Demands for improved treatment; (2) Demands for resumption of work, with the former being the majority. The bureau has decided to adjust treatment based on the cost of living index and will not agree to demands for adjusting base salaries. In the future, the handling of labor disputes will adopt two methods: (A) Holding factory meetings to implement coordination. (B) Handling everything in accordance with the law, and those who arbitrarily strike, be lazy, close factories, or suspend operations will be dealt with jointly by the security organs. Cultural Affairs: (1) Sixty newspapers have been registered, 247 magazines, 18 news agencies, 224 books, and 49 scripts. There are currently some small publications that are seriously undermining public morals. Such over-the-line publications will be dealt with by the police. (2) 41 theaters have been approved for registration, 90 theatrical troupes, and 19 bookstores. Social Welfare: 85 charitable organizations have been registered and 22 public welfare organizations. Relief Work: (1) Establishing refugee and child shelters, with a total of 1,305 people sheltered in Caohejing. (2) One public pawnshop has been established, and two more are being prepared. (3) Managing winter relief, establishing shelters to provide warmth, and those who can be repatriated are being repatriated, while the rest are being transferred to shelters.</p>
<p>Councilors' Questions:</p>
<p>After Director Wu finished his report, the assembly took a ten-minute break, and then Xu Yongzuo raised questions: (1) Although the commercial registration fee has been reduced, have any amended regulations been promulgated in other individual laws? (2) The Ministry of Economic Affairs' Fuel Committee handles the distribution of coal, which is exclusively for state-owned factories. Although private enterprises also have allocations, ordinary citizens have no opportunity to obtain it. What can be done about this? (3) There is considerable doubt about the cost of living index, especially the rent item, which is over 3,100 times higher. Even including fuel, it is still staggering. Please explain. (4) Since workers' demands to increase base salaries are not being changed, why have the base salaries of employees of major companies been changed recently? Shui Xiangyun hopes: (1) To make greater efforts in handling labor disputes to prevent them from escalating. (2) Over 1,400 workers have come to Shanghai from the interior, but only seven have been introduced to jobs. He hopes to establish a unified base standard for treatment. (3) Is it reasonable for shop employees to organize unions? (4) To pay attention to helping prostitutes and changing social customs. Pan Xulun had many thoughts on wage policies and the cost of living index, saying briefly: The industries most affected by labor disputes are currently those that are union-operated, public utilities, and cultural enterprises. Some people believe that the Social Affairs Bureau's current wage policy is speaking for the capitalists, which is arbitrary. Fellow workers in the labor community should use calm minds and broad vision to make accurate judgments. He believes that paying wages according to the cost of living index is not in line with economic principles. He previously made suggestions, but was opposed by Li Jianhua, director of the Labor Department. In reality, if wages are based on the cost of living index, it will not be sustainable by production, because China's current production index is far below the cost of living index. If it is implemented, it will inevitably lead to the bad consequences of "sitting and eating the mountain empty."</p>
<p>Director's Response:</p>
<p>Because Director Wu wanted to attend an important meeting of President Song, he did not have time, so he first answered the questions raised by the three councilors: (1) Industrial and commercial registration and other points have been seriously addressed. He first exchanged views with the City Chamber of Commerce and the special envoy of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and agreed to revise the various points, which were then passed by the Municipal Council before being submitted to the central government for review. (2) The Fuel Committee was originally a municipal government organization, but it was later managed by the central government. Initially, coal was exclusively for public utilities. Later, citizens were allocated fuel, and could purchase 50 pounds of coal dust and coal balls with their electricity bill, but the quantity was indeed small. (3) The cost of living index is divided into three types: workers, employees, and foreigners. The workers' cost of living index is entirely based on necessities such as food (vegetables, oil, flour, etc.), housing (including rent, water, electricity, fuel, clothing, etc.), and the items are relatively simple. The change in the base salary was caused by the prior agreement between labor and management, and the bureau naturally did not interfere. (4) The factory meeting system can enable labor and management to discuss various assets, production, and other issues, allowing the labor side to understand the difficulties of the management side and not make excessive demands. This system has achieved considerable results. (5) Giving work to workers from the interior is a matter of course, but because workers from both places often cannot cooperate, causing disputes, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has been requested to allocate three factories specifically for workers from the interior, which has been approved and will be distributed soon. As for the same pay for the same work, it is not possible in the current state of China's industrial backwardness, and can only be applied within the same factory. If small factories also follow this method, they will inevitably be unable to sustain themselves. (6) Shop employees must not form unions according to the law. The most reasonable thing is to organize friendship associations. (7) Efforts should be made to change social customs. However, there is disappointment that some prostitutes still wish to return to their old profession even after being introduced to other jobs. (8) The current wage policy of the bureau is based on the common practice in Europe and the United States, that is, to implement maximum wages during wartime and minimum wages at peacetime to ensure a minimum standard of living. The current situation of most factories is poor labor discipline, insufficient equipment and power, and insufficient capital, which is the reason for increasing the production index. (9) Workers who have already obtained wages sufficient to maintain their livelihood and still make unreasonable demands should be stopped with action.</p>
<p>Due to time constraints, Councilors Lü Entan, Cao Jun, Li Bojia, Xu Shihao, and Zhao Banfu submitted written inquiries. The meeting adjourned at 12:15 PM. The second group review meeting was held at 3 PM in the afternoon. The third group review meeting will be held this morning, and the eighth general assembly will be held this afternoon, where the Police Bureau will report.</p>
<p>Group Review Meetings Hold Second Meetings Yesterday</p>
<p>The Municipal Council held its second group review meeting at 3 PM yesterday afternoon. The first group review meeting was postponed. The second group review meeting reviewed matters related to financial, economic, and construction issues. Xi Yushu, Wang Yansong, Xu Yongzuo, Shui Xiangyun, Shen Ding, Xi Bingcheng, Ye Fenghu, Pan Xulun, Xu Shihao, Zhou Xuexiang, and Wan Molin attended, with Wang Yansong chairing the meeting.

<h3 id="e62">Li Deyu, Manager of the Bank of China's London Branch, Arrives in Shanghai from Chongqing for Talks; Sino-British Trade Expected to Return to Normal Soon <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Li Deyu, Manager of the Bank of China's London Branch and Vice Chairman of the Sino-British Chamber of Commerce in London, has been managing the bank's affairs in the UK for seventeen years. He flew to Chongqing on the 10th of last month to report on his duties and arrived in Shanghai last week. The reporter made a special visit to him to inquire about the economic situation in the UK and the future of Sino-British trade. He provided a detailed explanation, which is summarized as follows: He said that the UK was greatly affected by the war, and its vitality was greatly depleted. After the war, its own economic situation was not good. It has now successively borrowed funds from the United States to replenish the factory machinery that was damaged during the war and to purchase food. After the domestic situation gradually improves, it will fully restore its export trade. It is estimated that the current export volume has reached 60% of the peak export volume before the war, and it is expected to continue to increase thereafter. At the same time, it is hoped that China can gradually export goods such as eggs, bristles, and hides, which were shipped to the UK before the war, to the country, so that British products can also be regularly imported into China, so that the system of exchanging goods for goods can be promoted to the fullest extent.</p>
<p>The reporter asked whether the Sino-British telegraphic transfer rate should be announced as soon as possible after the opening of the foreign exchange market. He said: It would be best to announce it as soon as possible, but at present, because there is not much Sino-British trade after the war, there is actually no need to formally announce it. At present, the settlement of remittances from this city to the UK is calculated at the rate of 3.70 USD per British pound, while the British side still hopes to calculate it at the original exchange rate of 4.03 USD. Currently, British merchants in China have not promoted normal trade between China and the UK because commodity prices in China are high and the UK's own economic situation has not recovered. However, he believes that this is an inevitable phenomenon during the transition period, and the prosperity of past trade will soon be restored.</p>

<h3 id="e66">The Powerful Factions and Speculative Gangs Collude: Creating a "Fait Accompli" - Government Bonds Rise by Over a Thousand Yuan Yesterday <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, confidence in government bonds continued to rise. The scrapped New Harbor Notes have been recognized as Hong Kong legal tender by the Hong Kong authorities. General sentiment, interpreting this loosely, hopes that our authorities will also recognize the "fait accompli," pushing national bonds to an unbelievable level. One call elicits a hundred responses, with followers gathering in droves. At the same time, powerful factions are searching for "miscellaneous brands," hoping to achieve sudden success. Since these "miscellaneous brands" stand firm and unbroken, speculators feel even more excited about Category C bonds. The rise of one leads to the following of others, creating an endless cycle. Consequently, Category C bonds rose from around 3,100 yuan at the opening in the morning to approximately 4,100 yuan. Categories A and B rose from 1,950 yuan to 2,300 yuan, Category D to 2,500 yuan, and Category E to over 2,700 yuan. The amount of chips has been exhausted, the big accounts bravely spend money like dirt. It is scatter and the bears do not have the power to resist and by noon, everything ended at its highest point. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Categories A and B jumped by more than 800 yuan, Category C by more than 1,100 yuan, and Categories D and E by more than 900 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e67">The Gold Market is Quiet <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market remained unchanged, stable but weak, while stocks and bonds rebounded. The gold market was abandoned again. The process ended without much progress in the midst of calmness. The morning opening was slightly firm at around 1.51 million. After the opening, due to the decline in the stock market, some bulls abandoned stocks and entered gold, reaching 1.54 million. The Bank of China's allocation price remained unchanged, but before long, some "naked shorts" from Lichuan entered the bond and stock markets. The high price could not be sustained. Before noon, it still fell within the 1.5 million mark. In the afternoon, it continued to decline slightly, eventually recovering slightly after hitting a low. The result was similar to the previous closing. Gold ornaments in silver shops were at 165,000, tael silver at 1,600, and silver dollars remained at around 1,050 yuan. The black market interest rate tightened initially but then eased, with the interest rate falling from 1.9 cents to around 1.5 cents.</p>

<p>Foreign exchange rate fluctations is narrow, the situation is mediocre, moving in tandem with the gold market, initially stable but then weakening, resulting in a slight decline compared to the previous closing. Old Hong Kong notes have paled in comparison, and holders have been eager to sell old and exchange for new, resulting in the old weakening and the new stabilizing. Old notes fell from 410 yuan to 380 yuan for sale, while new notes rose to 360 yuan initially. Many people gave up halfway through, dropping to 340 yuan. Eventually, both recovered slightly and stabilized. As a result, compared to the previous closing, old notes fell by 20 yuan, while new notes rose by 10 yuan. Robies were at 500 yuan, and Hong Kong Power at 390 yuan, with sales occurring.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Yarn and Cotton Transactions are Quiet <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market still lacked progress yesterday, as there were no large-scale sales to customers. Transactions among peers were extremely quiet, with a very small turnover. Prices fluctuated within a small range, sentiment was calm, and the trend was mediocre. The Textile Construction Company sold cotton cloth as usual yesterday and launched nine types of American cloth at the same time.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York American cotton rose by 17 to 21 points per pound. The recent price was US$28.09, the forward price was US$28.15, and the spot price for middling was 2.63. The cotton market in Wuhu was stable as usual, and transactions remained scarce. The Textile Construction Company has recently ordered a large amount of American and Indian cotton, and it seems that there is no urgent need to purchase more. Therefore, transactions are not as developed as in the previous few days. As for the private sector, only the No. 1 Zhongxin Factory purchased Funing cotton (produced in Yancheng) for around 95,000 yuan, and the No. 6 Factory purchased Huoji cotton for 74,000 yuan. The above prices are the factory prices. Seed cotton traded for 16,500 yuan at the warehouse.</p>

<p>Butterfield &amp; Swire, the manager of the Foreign Department, brought over 36,180 pieces of cotton from Seattle via the "Ecrolloon" ship. The "Davia Creek," managed by the American President Lines, also transported over 15,000 pieces of cotton from the United States. It is reported that the two ships have arrived at the Wusongkou and are anchored outside the port, waiting for the pilots to board the ships and guide them into the port. In addition, the "Mitchell Eddy Todd" ship, managed by the Foye company, also carries over 30,840 pieces of American cotton. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, but was not seen entering the port last night. According to company sources, it should be arriving in Shanghai today.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Anhui Province Opens Up Grain - Rice, Flour, Oil, and Soybeans All Fall <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>

Zi Yuan and Yuan Jun rice both continued to fall by a little over 1,000 yuan. Recently, large quantities of Wuxi rice and paddy from inland areas have been arriving in Wuxi from Yixing, Liyang, and Jiangyin along the Jiangnan Road. A large number of miscellaneous grains have also arrived in Wuxi, mostly transported via the Longhai-Bengbu line. This smooth flow is entirely due to the opening of Anhui Province. If shipments continue to arrive from various routes in the future, there is a possibility that the rice market and miscellaneous grains will continue to decline. Flour also fell by 300 to 400 yuan due to declines in the inland areas. The oil market was tight in the morning but weakened in the afternoon. Clear oil was scarce and remained firm, while soybean oil was flat and weak. Raw oil futures retreated by a little over 1,000 yuan, and soybean cakes and bran were both flat and weak.

<h3 id="e87">Weakness and Motherly Love <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>- Wang Wenxin</p>
<p>- Written to commemorate the first Children's Day after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War -</p>
<p>Yesterday was Children's Day. Looking at the myriad of weak and wandering children in the universe and the indifference of people in the world today, I cannot help but sigh sadly, cherishing the greatness of motherly love.</p>
<p>Old age and death are unavoidable phenomena for living things. The oldest animals live for no more than 500 years. Therefore, living things must give birth to young ones before individuals get old and die in order to seek the "existence" of repetition and expansion of the individual. However, all young ones must be weak. The more advanced the animals, the more fragile and unable to survive on their own when they are young. They cannot feed themselves when hungry, cannot clothe themselves when cold, do not know how to avoid danger, and cannot defend themselves against enemies. If all adults treat them with indifference and ruthlessness and do not like to help and nurture them, then all young ones will only wither away and cannot grow. The universe and all things will also return to illusion and reduction. Therefore, sympathizing with the weak, loving the weak, and nurturing the weak is the nature of all adults. Kang Qing said: "Like protecting a baby." Mencius said: "When people suddenly see a child about to fall into a well, they all have a feeling of fear and compassion." The reason why human beings can survive and prosper and all things can continue to grow is that there are weak ones to make up for the inevitable defects of old age and death, and that all adults can show special sympathy for the weak.</p>
<p>However, human sympathy is sometimes transferred by internal psychology and the external environment. Internal psychology, such as the desire for power, vanity, etc., is often enough to make people become cruel and unwilling to sympathize with the weak and suffering. The Latin poet Lucretius once said: "It is a pleasant thing to stand on the shore and see people struggling in suffering when the wind rises and the waves rise." The great philosopher Spinoza used to catch mosquitoes and flies and place them in spider webs to watch them being swallowed as pleasure. Nietzsche advocated that the strong should promote the demise of the weak in order to fulfill their responsibilities. These are all clear evidence. In terms of the environment, ignorance, poverty, famine, and war are also enough to make people become cold and ruthless. The Romans made people fight and kill animals for entertainment. The Spanish made animals fight and kill animals for entertainment. The Spartans killed weak babies. In China, it is popular in some places to drown girls, which is regarded as a matter of course. When people are poor and hungry, they sell their children, and even exchange children to eat. When people are fleeing in war, babies are weak and are discarded everywhere. These are all clear evidence. Russell said in "The Problem of China" that Chinese "thousands of people are waiting to die in famine, and people sell their children for a few dollars, and kill them if they cannot sell them," saying that the Chinese nation lacks sympathy and is cruel in character. However, everyone has the human nature of pitying the weak, and ignorance, poverty, famine, and war can indeed make people lose their nature. Since the start of this war, due to the protracted duration, the spread of the war, the extreme damage, and the excessive sacrifice, two-thirds of the world's people are struggling to survive in the fire, escape, and famine. Unconsciously, some people have become particularly focused on economics, reality, and snobbery. Under the circumstances of only knowing how to get rid of hunger, cold, and death, who can the tens of thousands of weak people rely on? In the migration of fleeing, it is inevitable that children are regarded by adults as only able to sit and eat and are sold. When getting on and off the vehicles, it is inevitable that they will be squeezed out because they are young and weak, wandering the streets. After being captured, sold, or picked up, it is inevitable that they will be killed and played with by the enemy, or enslaved or abused by living people. A scene of the suffering of the weak is gradually unfolding in the ruthless fire and hunger. If you pay attention to the streets at dusk and the fields of desolate villages, the sad stories almost make people suspect that they are in hell. Those who are in pain think of their parents. If you want to save the weak from danger and turn coldness into warmth, then it is only by promoting motherly love that you can save the lost opportunity of heaven and earth? (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e88">Chairman Chiang's Political Report to the Political Consultative Conference - Full Text (Part 1) <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang delivered a political report to the National Political Consultative Conference on the morning of the 1st. The full text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Fellow members of the Political Consultative Conference: It has been half a year since Japan surrendered and the War of Resistance ended. The government's efforts to secure international and domestic peace during this period can be divided into the following six areas:</p>
<p>Striving for Internal and External Peace - Implementing Six Measures</p>
<p>(1) For the sake of world peace and security, co-signing the United Nations Charter with friendly nations, promoting the United Nations organization, and participating in the Security Council, with the aim of rebuilding international justice and the order of law. (2) For the sake of good neighborly relations with neighboring countries and stability within our borders, seeking solutions to outstanding border issues with relevant countries, the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance will enable the two major countries bordering each other to achieve a path of peaceful cooperation. (3) For the sake of freedom and equality for all ethnic groups within the country, assisting ethnic groups outside the provinces with concrete self-governance capabilities and the will for independence, and when they have reached a level of economic and political development where they can be independent, supporting their independence and self-governance. For ethnic groups within the provinces, granting them equality in politics and law, and granting them full freedom in belief and economics. (4) For the sake of stability in domestic social order, the cessation of party disputes, and the early end of political tutelage and the implementation of constitutional government, adhering to the consistent principle that "political problems should be resolved by political means," convening the Political Consultative Conference to jointly discuss methods for convening the National Assembly, study the principles of the draft constitution, and decide to expand the foundation of the National Government before the implementation of constitutional government, urging people from all parties and social elites to participate together, and formulating an Outline for Peaceful National Reconstruction as a guideline for governance during this transitional period. (5) In order to stop domestic military conflicts, issuing orders to cease conflict and restore transportation, and establishing the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation to implement the ceasefire orders. (6) In order to implement the military demobilization plan and consolidate the independent communist armies into the national army to ensure the unification of the army structure and military orders, the military subgroup meeting will develop a reorganization and consolidation plan, which the government firmly adheres to without wavering, and the sections that deal with the national army are being implemented faithfully in accordance with the predetermined steps.</p>
<p>The above six items are all efforts to seek a path to peaceful unification. If the direction of peaceful unification can be implemented effectively, the great cause of national reconstruction can proceed smoothly. If efforts towards peaceful unification suffer setbacks, the crisis for the nation and its people will worsen day by day. You all will surely show deep concern for these issues concerning the survival of the nation. On the diplomatic front, Minister Wang has already reported to the Assembly. The agreements of the Political Consultative Conference have been reported to you by Secretary-General Shao. I will now provide a simple explanation of the recent developments in the Northeast problem, the events of the Yining Incident in Xinjiang, the methods for resolving it, and the discussions on the revised principles of the Political Consultative Conference's draft constitution.</p>
<p>We know that the Northeast and Xinjiang issues have a significant impact on the nation's peaceful unification, and the constitution is the fundamental law of the state organization. These three issues are the most important diplomatic and political issues facing China today, and I believe it is necessary to present them frankly to the Assembly:</p>
<p>The Development Trend in the Northeast is a Diplomatic Issue</p>
<p>(1) The Recent Developments in the Northeast Problem: The Northeast problem is essentially a diplomatic issue. The focus of the issue is that we, the Chinese National Government, are receiving Chinese sovereignty in the Northeast in accordance with the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and its annexes. The process of receiving sovereignty in the Northeast has already been reported separately by Foreign Minister Wang, and there is no need to repeat it at this time. What I want to add specifically is the recent exchange of documents between the Chinese and Soviet governments. On February 22nd, the Soviet Ambassador informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that "the Soviet government informs the Chinese government that the Soviet army will have completed its withdrawal from Manchuria by the end of April of this year, in accordance with the government's decision." The Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied on the 27th that "the Chinese government agrees that the Soviet army can complete its withdrawal from Manchuria by the end of April of this year for the convenience of the Soviet side. Please inform us of the dates when the Soviet army will withdraw from various locations and, in accordance with the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, provide convenience and assistance to the Chinese government's troop replacements during the withdrawal." Foreign Minister Wang also told the Soviet Ambassador on the same day that "there is still more than a month before the Soviet army completes its withdrawal, and the Northeast railway network is extensive and transportation is convenient. The Chinese government's troops are fully capable of reaching the various locations where the Soviet army is withdrawing before the Soviet army withdraws. Please inform the Northeast Soviet Army Command to quickly discuss with our military delegation, headed by Lieutenant General Dong Yanping, the arrangements for the handover of defenses in various locations, so that our army can receive assistance from the Soviet side during the takeover." This is the recent negotiation process between China and the Soviet Union regarding the issue of receiving sovereignty in the Northeast.</p>
<p>I deeply believe that after hearing our report, you comrades will feel greatly hopeful about the clarification of the situation in the Northeast. We have always recognized that peaceful cooperation between China and the Soviet Union is not only a common need for both countries, but also a basic condition for peace in the Far East and security in the world. I am even more certain that the Soviet Union's need for peace to facilitate reconstruction is the same as our need in China. Our China will surely obtain the peaceful cooperation of the Soviet Union, and temporary twists and turns in any one place or event cannot shake our confidence. The basis for peaceful cooperation between China and the Soviet Union is the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and its annexes. We can only abide by the spirit of the treaty and its annexes, and hope that the Soviet Union will jointly fulfill the spirit of the treaty and its annexes. This is the foundation of peaceful cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, and it is our two countries' valuable contribution to peace in the East and security in the world.</p>
<p>Before Completing the Takeover, There is No Internal Politics to Speak Of</p>
<p>Secondly, talking about the internal political problems in the Northeast, we can say that before the sovereignty of the nine provinces in the Northeast is fully received, there is no internal political problems to speak of. If someone raises internal political problems and uses them as conditions for negotiations with the central government during the period when the sovereignty of the Northeast has not been recovered and the diplomatic problems have not been resolved, it will inevitably hinder our receipt of sovereignty and increase diplomatic difficulties, then we don't know what their intentions are. If, under the current difficult diplomatic situation, there are still domestic parties taking advantage of this difficult diplomatic situation to demand that the government recognize their illegal status and special rights, seeking the interests of their own individuals or parties, and disregarding the life and death of the nation, then such actions that harm the country and the people should never be done. The central government's responsibility for the Northeast now is only to receive the territory and restore the integrity of sovereign administration. This is not only the government's responsibility, but also the demand of the nation and its people. The people of the Northeast have been separated from their motherland for fourteen years under the Japanese invading forces and the rule of the puppet Manchukuo. Their only hope now is that the sovereignty and administration of the Republic of China can be fully exercised in the nine provinces of the Northeast, allowing them to once again be protected by the laws of their own country and become free citizens of the Republic of China. When the nation's sovereignty is restored and administration is complete in the Northeast, the people of the Northeast will naturally enjoy the right to local autonomy in accordance with national laws. But now, the truly patriotic compatriots in the Northeast do not want to use the name of local autonomy at this time to hinder the government's receipt of sovereignty and divide the territory of the Northeast. This is out of their sincere patriotic desire, and we must not let them down.</p>
<p>The Kuomintang Has Struggled in the Northeast for Fourteen Years</p>
<p>For fourteen years, the military and civilians of the Northeast, under the leadership of members of the Chinese Kuomintang, have armed themselves to resist Japanese occupation and oppression. From September 18th to the day of the Japanese surrender, the number of people who died and were imprisoned during these fourteen years, excluding the more than 100,000 army officers and soldiers, the number of cadres sacrificed by the Chinese Kuomintang, such as Zhang Tao, Wei Zhongda, Yu Zhonghe, and Hui Dashan, reached as many as 1,432. The Japanese and puppet Manchukuo's control was strengthened day by day, and the armed activities of the masses and the underground work of comrades became more and more difficult. However, when Japan surrendered, there were still 2,700 members of the Chinese Kuomintang who were released from the Japanese and puppet prisons in Jilin, Changchun, and Harbin. May I ask, how many members of the Communist Party were there? The trust of the people of the Northeast in the Chinese Kuomintang, and the achievements of the Chinese Kuomintang members' hard work in the Northeast, these figures are the most accurate proof.</p>
<p>During the period when Japan occupied and controlled the Northeast, the Communist Party did not have any armed forces to speak of. The discovery of the Communist Party's troops in the Northeast only happened after the Japanese surrender. The Communist Party troops that entered the Northeast from Rehe Province, and the Communist Party troops that crossed the sea from Yantai with a small number of weapons, were all empty-handed. These several troops combined are what they call the "Democratic Allied Army." Their only work now is to obstruct the government's troops from receiving sovereignty, and to demand a special political situation. It must be known that obstructing the receipt of national sovereignty is obstructing the implementation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, and is also threatening peace in the Far East and security in the world. For the sake of national sovereignty and international peace, our National Government can never recognize the actions of the Communist Party's so-called "Democratic Allied Army" in obstructing the receipt of sovereignty and its so-called "elected government," which is an illegal organization. If they can practice and fulfill the reorganization and consolidation plan without obstructing the government's actions to receive sovereignty, then our government, with a benevolent heart, should give them a legitimate and honorable way out and an opportunity to be loyal to the motherland. This is a point that we must clearly recognize and firmly grasp regarding the Northeast problem.</p>
<p>On January 10th of this year, government representatives and Communist Party representatives, with the assistance of General Marshall, jointly declared a method to stop conflict and restore transportation, stipulating that "Section 2 of the order to stop conflict does not affect the National Government's troops entering the nine provinces of the Northeast or moving within the nine provinces of the Northeast in order to restore sovereignty." This clause was established based on the above understanding and is still valid today. However, the Communist Party's troops in the Northeast are now obstructing the government's actions to receive sovereignty in various parts of the Northeast, causing armed conflicts, disrupting local social order, and harming the lives and property of the people. This is something that we are very saddened by. The National Government is concerned about the suffering of the local people and hopes that the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation will carefully select an executive team to send to the Northeast to stop the local military conflict. From the time General Marshall proposed to the Military Tripartite Conference on the 11th of last month to the 27th of last month, after multiple meetings, an agreement was reached. Under the following conditions, the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation will carefully select an executive team to go to the Northeast: (1) The task of the team is limited to military mediation work; (2) The team should work in the areas of both the government army and the Communist Party army, and avoid entering areas still occupied by Soviet troops; (3) The team should go to the locations of conflict or the closely contacting points between the government army and the Communist Party army to stop the conflict and make necessary and fair mediation. All parties also agreed that the three-person meeting would continue to discuss military issues in the Northeast, and that political issues would be discussed separately to seek a solution quickly.</p>
<p>Peace, Struggle, and Unity - Handling the Communist Army in the Northeast</p>
<p>What I want to add here is that in the last few meetings, the Communist Party representative specifically raised matters that he requested to be recorded: "The government should guarantee to discuss with the Communist Party the interim measures for relevant political matters in the Northeast in accordance with the methods stipulated by the Political Consultative Conference. The government does not interfere with or hinder the currently elected local governments, pending the resolution of political issues." Based on this, it can be clearly known that the Communist Party representative's opinion obviously wants to use the so-called "Democratic Allied Army" of his Northeast Communist Party troops and the so-called "elected government" that they illegally created to obtain the basis for his cooperation in obstructing the government's attempt to receive sovereignty. The government representative could not agree to this and has resolutely rejected it. This is an important point in the meeting process, so it is necessary to report it to the Assembly. Secondly, it is the policy adopted by the government on the Northeast problem. The government's only goal in the nine provinces of the Northeast is to receive sovereignty and implement the nation's administrative power. The mediation of military conflicts is only carried out under the premise of not affecting the government's receipt of sovereignty and exercise of national administrative power. As for all illegal regimes that violate the will of the people of the Northeast and hinder the sovereignty and administration of the Northeast, they cannot be recognized by the National Government and the people of the whole country. We hope that the Communist Party troops in the Northeast will stop trampling on the people, coercing the people, forging public opinion, and obstructing the actions of the national sovereign administration. In particular, we hope that they will accept the consolidation plan, join the national army, and work hard for the nation and its people. We have always firmly believed that the sentiment of loving the country and loving the nation is shared by all Chinese. We should use the spirit of peace, struggle, and unity to handle the problem of the Communist Party troops in the Northeast. We firmly believe that this is the only correct way to solve the Northeast problem. (Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd, telegram, full text to be continued).</p>

<p>A train of soldiers traveling on what used to be the "South Manchuria Railway," now the "China Changchun Railway," is an unprecedented event for us!</p>
<p>The "South Manchuria Railway" posed too great a threat to us in the past. Countless people have been beaten and kicked by Japanese soldiers and police, and countless lives have been lost. The September 18th Incident also started with the so-called "explosion incident" created by the Japanese.</p>
<p>Those who could boarded this troop train from Shenyang to Tieling, first loading the train in HuangguTun, and then pulling it to the Shenyang Station on the "China Changchun Railway." Once the train started, it was advancing on the China Changchun Railway. The first thing that caught the eye was the large [bridge] where the Japanese assassinated Zhang Zuolin. The Beining Railway passed under the bridge, leading to the Shenyang General Station.</p>
<p>At "Beidaying," [there is] a low group of dwarf Japanese trees, leading to several large buildings. The puppet Manchukuo army received training here. Next to this section of the railway, the Japanese erected a structure representing the explosion of the rails. There is also a permanent monument. The shamelessness of the Japanese warlords looks quite pathetic today!</p>
<p>North of Beidaying, there is a very large factory, said to be thirty or forty *li* in circumference. Its name is the "1918 Factory," and it manufactures light tanks... The Japanese orchestrated a masterpiece to destroy our Northeast. Scene after scene flashed before my eyes.</p>
<p>The Factory Chimneys Do Not Smoke</p>
<p>Workers Hope to Resume Work Soon</p>
<p>The double-track railway allows smooth passage for the Soviets. The trains sped along the route without stopping, frequently passing other trains head-on, flashing by. The 120 *li* distance between Shenyang and Tieling was covered in two hours.</p>
<p>Tieling is a city with a population of over 50,000. The area around the station has many new buildings, and the streets are wide. It used to be a Japanese residential area, but now many doors are closed, and everything changes with the times.</p>
<p>The city area is narrow and muddy, with mud and water all over the streets. To pass through, one must wear high rubber boots. Many large stores are located on these streets. The reporter arrived in Tieling on the third day of the National Army's entry into Tieling. The Tieling market has already returned to normal.</p>
<p>Tieling originally had more than ten large factories and twenty small factories, producing light metals, paper, bricks, cloth, etc. At the same time, the Japanese, because the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant was a bombing target for our side, planned to establish a steel branch plant in Tieling. Before it was completed, it was attacked.</p>
<p>Most of the machinery in all the factories was taken away by the Soviet army. The small remaining portion was moved to Faku by the Communists, so now the chimneys of the major factories are not smoking. In the past, in addition to male workers, most women and children in Tieling worked in factories, about 20,000 people. Now that there is no work to do, everyone unanimously [hopes] that they will strictly punish [those responsible] and allow the few small factories that can operate to resume work as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Local Gentry Patrol at Night</p>
<p>Most Koreans Changed Their Japanese Names</p>
<p>Tieling has over ten thousand Japanese residents, mostly "South Manchuria Railway" employees and technicians from various factories. They were subjected to the exploitation and rape of the "big noses." At the same time, our poor people and vagrants took the opportunity to seize some of the remaining items. On the eve of the "August 13th" liberation of the Northeast, our compatriots released from prison rioted in the Japanese area every night to take revenge. The local gentry, believing that this should not continue, personally led security personnel to patrol at night, thus stabilizing order. Koreans, numbering three thousand in the county, are mostly rice farmers. Another part are workers in various factories. Most of them changed to Japanese surnames, bullied others, and committed all kinds of evils. The number of compatriots harmed by them is too great. Today, we do not demand anything from them and allow them to live freely. Everyone hopes that the Korean government will punish these people.</p>
<p>Japanese Residents Plan to Hold a Song and Dance Performance</p>
<p>National Troops Decline Their Consolation</p>
<p>Five *li* away from Tieling, the Japanese spent three or four years building a steel bridge two *hua li* long on the Tiefa County Road, which was just completed. On the eve of surrender, they blew it up. This is truly a loss for us. Now, in addition to a few Japanese residents being recruited to work, some are setting up stalls on a street near the station, selling food, cigarettes, and worn clothing to make a living. On the day the reporter arrived, the Japanese residents planned to hold a song and dance performance to慰劳 the National Army. The National Army authorities informed them that they were staying temporarily and declined.</p>
<p>The "South Manchuria Railway Hospital" is a well-equipped hospital in Tieling, with the best X-ray equipment, etc. Currently, there are 21 Japanese doctors, dozens of Japanese female nurses, and more than ten Japanese staff members working as usual. In addition to anesthetics and antipyretics, the medicines are also very complete. Many Chinese and Japanese people come there to see a doctor every day.</p>
<p>Local Politics Undergo Changes</p>
<p>The Eighth Route Army Took Away a Large Number of People</p>
<p>According to a local elder who told the reporter, after the "August 15th" liberation, Tieling fell into chaos. A temporary county government maintenance association was organized to maintain治安. More than 100 employees of the county government continued to work as usual. The chairman of the maintenance association was Zhuang Shaoyu, the former puppet Manchukuo Tieling County Chief. The vice-chairman was Zhang Jingze, the former puppet Manchukuo Tieling Mayor. A local gentry, Wang Zigui, was also pushed to be a vice-chairman.</p>
<p>The Soviet army arrived in Tieling on August 22nd. In addition to the Japanese, we also suffered many damages. Later, the Communist army came, and the appointed County Chief was Liu Weidong, who was good to the people. This time, when the Communist army withdrew from Tieling, Liu Weidong left with them, and Zhuang Shaoyu was also taken away. In addition, many people followed the Eighth Route Army. Most of them were unemployed workers, and there were also a few teachers. When the Communist army first arrived, they forced local people to enlist, so the number taken away was quite large.</p>
<p>Before the Communist army arrived, two Kuomintang departments were competing to recruit party members and engaged in fierce mutual attacks. One of them unscrupulously recruited hooligans. When the Eighth Route Army came, these hooligans switched their allegiance to the Eighth Route Army. They had served as secret agents in the puppet Manchukuo. When the National Army arrived, the two departments were still arguing. The reason for this phenomenon, it is said, is that one was a former worker in the area who was arrested and imprisoned, and was released after liberation. The other thought that the former was in trouble and newly [arrived].</p>
<p>The newly appointed Tieling Mayor and County Chief, Li Guiting, arrived late. It was the fourth day of the National Army's entry into Tieling before news arrived from Shenyang. The military person in charge there believed that this style was a failure, so he sent an urgent telegram to Shenyang to inform the administrative persons in charge in Kaiyuan, Sipingjie, and other places to go to take over with the army to avoid interrupting government affairs.</p>
<p>The Battle of Balizhuang Was Fierce</p>
<p>Deputy Commander of the 89th Regiment Was Wounded</p>
<p>The National Army's expansion towards Tieling started on March 19th from the Wenguantun Station north of Shenyang. The march was extremely difficult because the bridges were destroyed by the Eighth Route Army, and there was also deep melting mud. On the morning of the 23rd, they reached a place five or six *li* away from Tieling. At 9:30 in the morning, they began to make contact with the Communist army. The left wing captured Toutaizi and Ertaizi after fighting for two and a half hours. The right wing captured Balizhuang at 7:00 a.m. on the 24th.</p>
<p>The battle of Balizhuang was quite fierce. On the National Army side, Luo Shunfu, the Deputy Commander of the 89th Regiment, was wounded. More than 30 other soldiers were wounded and killed. Eighty-three Communist soldiers were captured, along with six unidentifiable rocket launchers and many guns. It is said that the Communist army suffered heavy casualties, with 431 bodies left behind.</p>
<p>The Communist army defending Tieling consisted of the 24th Brigade of the New Fourth Army, the 19th Regiment of the Liaobei Provincial Security Army, the 71st Regiment, the 5th Special Task Regiment, and the Tieling Security Brigade, totaling more than 3,000 people. On the 23rd, four trains arrived from the north, belonging to the New Fourth Army’s [number omitted] Brigade. On the morning of the 24th, another 3,000 people arrived. As soon as they got off the train, they retreated to the mountains and villages together with the retreating Communist army.</p>
<p>The Joint Middle School Has Started Classes</p>
<p>Students Are Scattered in the Surrounding Villages and Have Not Returned</p>
<p>Everything in Tieling has been settled. The joint middle school has started classes. The school is at the request of more than 600 students from the existing two male, one female, and one middle schools in Tieling. There were originally more than 1,000 students. Many are scattered in the surrounding villages and cannot come for the time being.</p>
<p>When the reporter went to visit, a classroom was having a composition class. The teacher had already written "A Letter of慰问 to the National Army" on the blackboard as the topic, and the students were writing and thinking. Then, they visited a health room with ultraviolet light and other equipment. According to the school teacher, the other equipment is also complete, but unfortunately it is not intact now.</p>
<p>There were originally nine elementary schools. When the reporter was in Tieling, they had not yet started. The middle school teachers are mostly temporarily taking on obligations for the education of the youth in their hometown. After the city and county take over, there should be new decisions.</p>
<p>The prices of food in Tieling are still quite low, while the price of cloth is higher than in Shanghai. Generally speaking, prices have risen four or five times successively since the "August 15th" liberation. Rice is 30 yuan per kilogram, sweet potato starch is 25 yuan per *manzhi jin*, pork is 28 yuan, millet is 4 yuan and 50 cents, corn flour is 3 yuan and 50 cents, and cabbage ranges from 1 yuan to 1 yuan and 50 cents. According to the *manzhi jin*, which is equivalent to 15 *liang* in the mainland, the official exchange rate of 法幣 is 13 yuan for 1 yuan of the Northeast circulation currency (puppet Manchukuo banknotes), and the Red Army tickets have the same value as the Northeast circulation currency.</p>
<p>The people of Tieling hope that good mayors and county chiefs will be sent to use the county government officials who have not left to implement good county administration in order to restore the prosperity of Tieling. The newly appointed mayors and county chiefs must not neglect this point! (Shenyang, March 28th.)</p>

<h3 id="e90">An Export Merchant <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Cheyi</p>
<p>In order to manage foreign exchange, the authorities require that all foreign exchange from exported goods must be purchased by designated banks. This undoubtedly greatly benefits the national economy. However, for the sake of the future of industry and commerce, it is absolutely impossible to increase the burden and difficulties of merchants. If there is no perfect method, it is necessary to avoid losing sight of one thing while attending to another. I have a few opinions to contribute to the relevant authorities.</p>
<p>According to the current method of foreign exchange management, merchants must entrust the bill of lading for all exported goods to a designated bank for negotiation. When the goods arrive abroad, the foreign importing merchant must prepare the foreign currency of the total value of the goods and redeem the bill of lading from the bank in order to take delivery of the goods. According to the above situation, merchants need to have two copies of funds in order to do an export business once, because one copy of funds is used to purchase goods domestically, and one copy of funds is used to redeem the bill of lading abroad. Although the goods can be mortgaged and a portion of the funds can be borrowed from the bank, the current high interest rates are definitely not affordable for export merchants.</p>
<p>Recently, the price of goods and foreign exchange have not been parallel, and there is actually no profit to be made from exports. In addition to the above-mentioned difficulties, the remaining export merchants will inevitably be unable to move forward and will transfer their capital to speculative businesses. This will have a great impact on the national construction plan, and there is a real need for improvement.</p>
<p>In terms of foreign exchange management, various countries have already implemented it in the early stages of the war. For example, in British Malaya and other places, for all exported goods, a bank guarantee must be provided. The exporting merchant must promise to remit the foreign exchange of the value of the goods back to the place of origin through the bank within six months in order to obtain export permission. In pre-war Japan, for all exported goods, the bank was entrusted to negotiate the bill of lading. After the bank completed the investigation and considered the actual situation feasible, it would lend the full amount to the exporting merchant without interest or with the lowest interest. When the goods arrive abroad and the bill of lading is received, the total value of the goods must be repaid to the bank within one month. According to the former method, foreign exchange can be managed without affecting the merchant's funds and business. The procedures are convenient and the difficulties are reduced. The latter is a good method to encourage exports and promote production. The above two methods are generally easy to implement, and are specially presented for the consideration and adoption of our wise authorities.

<p>At the Binjiang Tower, an impromptu farewell to A Mei, saying:</p>

<p>The painted curtain, bright and clear, rolls up the autumn smoke. Tears fill the golden goblet, words fill the strings. Drink one more cup, do not laugh at me, the country is all before the beauty.</p>

<p>This is Mr.'s promise to welcome you in the spring with A Mei. Later, a letter was received from A Mei in Shanghai, with eight chapters of melancholic poems, and at Zhengzhou, there were four poems on the photo of Lady Changmen, saying:</p>
<p>How can I bear to drink and hear songs again. Consuming my sorrows, what can I do? Since the poem of Chu Tian was composed, there has been much rain and clouds on the river.</p>
<p>The feather clothes startled and broke the sorrow of pipes and strings. The sound of trumpets and drums travels east, the iron cavalry comes. From now on, Jiangshan will cease to sing and dance, for whom will she dress up by the zither platform?</p>
<p>The Han Emperor valued beauty and lost the goose in shock. Ashamedly, he bought a painter with gold. All the talents of hegemony are hard to find a master, every year, he is drunk and passes Xin Feng.</p>

<p>In Beijing, listening to songs at a banquet, it was as if the traces of the Han chariot were evident, four poems said:</p>

<p>It is truly lingering and affectionate, with deep emotion. But Mr. has been wandering for years and has no strength to welcome Mei. It was once reported that Yang Yunshi's biography said that Peng Pei knew about this matter and competed to contribute money to get her removed from the register, which is not the case. Mei Mei passed a good scholar. Mr. also took in a Di Mei Nan in Shenyang (Mei Nan's story has a separate biography) because she resembled Mrs. Protector. Not long after, Mei Mei broke up again and heard of Mr.'s whereabouts at sea and arrived. Di Mei Nan treated her with special care. Four years had passed, the face and peach blossoms, [everything] was intact, recounting her floating life, reminiscing about the past and present, she could not help but be confused about her own life. Mr. gave her a poem, saying:</p>

<h3 id="e92">A Discussion on Suicide <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Jun</p>
<p>Suicide, as an act, seems to be unique to human society, the spirit of all things, and does not exist in general animal societies. This is probably because animals are just animals, with simple minds and no knowledge. They are only harmed and have not thought of suicide.</p>
<p>However, even within human society, it seems that one cannot generalize. The facts tell us that in so-called civilized societies, the occurrence of suicide is clearly more frequent than in uncivilized or semi-civilized societies. Therefore, if someone wants to regard suicide as one of the "malignant epidemics" brought about by modern civilized society, I think it is understandable.</p>
<p>Precisely because of this, suicide has gradually become one of the social problems in modern times and is often studied and explored.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, there are at least two different views on suicide at present. One view is that suicide is a brave act, the result of being unusually serious, persistent, unwilling to be perfunctory, and half-hearted. The other view is the opposite, that suicide is an expression of cowardice, evidence of not daring to face reality, overcome reality, and not having the courage to live on. Why do such extremely different views arise for the same act of suicide? I think that this is entirely due to the fact that people often examine a phenomenon from different perspectives. That is to say, the former looks at it from the perspective of individual behavior, while the latter looks at it from the perspective of society.</p>
<p>Among the countries of the world, the most popular suicide seems to be our "neighbor," Japan. Is that not so? Their "seppuku" and "shinju" (love suicide) are as well-known in the world as their cherry blossoms and Mount Fuji. In Japan, not to mention individual suicide, but also "group suicide" of the whole family is commonplace. Newspapers in Tokyo and Osaka often carry this kind of cruel and tragic news in large, bold font on the first and second pages. And the annual statistics of suicides often number in the tens of millions. Among modern writers, there are also many who commit suicide. For example, Ryunosuke Akutagawa and Takeo Arishima, who are quite well-known to the Chinese people, both died by suicide. The poet Harutsuki Ikuta, seems to be also.</p>
<p>Russia also seems to be one of the countries where "suicide disease" is quite popular. Taking writers as an example, there are quite a few who commit suicide. As everyone knows, the poets Sergei Yesenin and Vladimir Mayakovsky both died by suicide. Even Maxim Gorky attempted suicide once in his early years, fortunately unsuccessfully. Regarding the suicides of Mr. Yesenin and Mr. Mayakovsky, there is a famous anecdote. - Originally, after Mr. Yesenin committed suicide, Mr. Mayakovsky wrote a poem of mourning, the words of which were: "It is not difficult to die in this life; it is much more difficult to live on."</p>
<p>From this poem, it is clear that Mr. Mayakovsky did not quite approve of Mr. Yesenin's suicide; however, later, Mr. Mayakovsky also repeated the same tragedy as Mr. Yesenin due to various reasons. This was not only completely unexpected, but he himself, on that day, probably never thought of it.</p>
<p>In our China, in several large cities, especially in Shanghai, which is known as the "source of all evils," the news of taking poison and jumping into rivers has become one of the main sources of information for filling the social news pages of various newspapers. As for modern celebrities, as far as I know, since the Republic of China, those who have committed suicide include the old literary scholar Wang Guowei, an expert in the study of ci and qu; the new literary scholar Gu Zhongqi, a novelist, and Zhu Xiang, a poet. Hong Shen, a playwright, a few years ago, out of unbearable pressure in life, swallowed a large amount of red potion in an attempt to commit suicide, but fortunately he was rescued quickly and did not die.</p>
<p>Even a small ant is afraid of death and greedy for life. Who is not as eager to "live" as I am? A person who cannot get life and has to seek death, is there anything more tragic and worthy of sympathy in the world than this? But sympathy and agreement are not synonymous. Because suicide is ultimately one of the social pathologies that violate human nature, we hope that it can be completely eradicated as soon as possible, just as we hope that all malignant epidemics can be completely eradicated as soon as possible.</p>
<p>But how can we realize our hope? This is naturally not something that can be fully stated in a few words, so I will omit it for now.</p>
<p>However, one thing is absolutely certain, and that is: when people no longer feel "better to die" for various reasons, I ask, who would voluntarily seek death!………</p>

<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Master Mo suddenly opened his eyes, his mind still mixed with "drunkenness" and "dream" emotions! He looked around and realized that he was lying on the bed in his study. (Ever since Lihua was born and he was driven out by his wife, he had not lived with her.) On the desk, an oil lamp was burning, half bright and half dim. Lihua was leaning over the desk, murmuring something. Master Mo thought for a while, he remembered drinking with Master Weng in a small tavern, but he couldn't remember how he got home after that!</p>
<p>"Xiaohua!" Lihua heard Master Mo calling and hurried over.</p>
<p>"Dad, you're awake!"</p>
<p>"Mm! What are you doing?"</p>
<p>"I'm reading, Dad! You almost scared me to death just now! Uncle Weng sent you back, you were so drunk you couldn't even walk. Moshneg had to carry you to bed. You fell asleep as soon as you lay down." Lihua said, smiling, describing Master Mo's drunken state.</p>
<p>Only then did Master Mo understand how he had returned.</p>
<p>"Why aren't you asleep yet? What time is it?"</p>
<p>"It just struck eleven. Mom hasn't come back from the theater yet. Brother went to sleep. I was afraid you'd wake up wanting a drink, so I didn't dare leave. Dad, are you thirsty?" Lihua said, pouring a bowl of tea and handing it to Master Mo.</p>
<p>Master Mo took a few sips of water and held Lihua's hand tightly, both moved and troubled. He was moved that such a young child understood filial piety and knew how to care for him. At the same time, he was troubled that Madam Mo had gone to the theater alone and hadn't returned so late, which meant she was with Madam Weng again. Thinking of this, his memory gradually returned - he remembered that he had asked Master Weng to drink precisely because of Madam Weng's problem, and that he got drunk precisely because of Madam Weng's problem. He remembered that Master Weng said he couldn't solve the problem and didn't want to investigate it. He also advised him to treat everything as a dream and not to take dreams seriously, but he now strongly disagreed. He clearly saw these facts before him, which were not dreams! These facts deeply stimulated him and tormented him. He couldn't always endure everything numbly as he did when he was drunk!</p>
<p>Like a fire, it burned Master Mo's heart, and he felt hot all over! It was as if countless maggots were gnawing in his chest, and he coughed urgently, choking out a lot of phlegm.</p>
<p>"Dad! Quickly drink some water! Don't drink anymore alcohol. Look, you're coughing again!" Lihua said, pouring another bowl of tea and feeding it to Master Mo.</p>
<p>Master Mo didn't say anything. He just held Lihua's small hand tightly and didn't let go. It felt like a thousand words were stuck in his throat, and he didn't know where to start, only staring pleadingly at Lihua with his eyes.</p>

<p>An article was published, openly seeking the owner of the lost forty thousand yuan, which was returned after three days. Mr. Fu Runian came to the office to claim it. He immediately described the packaging method of the money and the attachments inside the package. After proving that it was correct, and with the guarantee of the Senchang Hardware Store on Mofang Street, and after this column sent staff to verify the guarantee, a receipt was issued, and the money was returned in full yesterday. An advertisement expressing gratitude was published on the same day to thank Mr. Yan for his honesty. The following is a letter from Mr. Fu: "To the Editor: On the afternoon of March 27th, I asked my servant, Dan Youfu, to deliver forty thousand yuan. He took the No. 10 tram from the 16th Wharf to Songshan Road and got off. It was raining heavily at the time. When getting off the tram, he accidentally dropped the money. When he got home, he realized it. Dan was very anxious. Later, a friend told him that Mr. Yan Xixian of Haimen had found the money and sent it to your office to be advertised." I am writing to request that it be returned. I am extremely grateful. I deeply admire Mr. Yan's honesty.

<p>Mr. Zi Jiwen: When I was young, my parents arranged a marriage contract for me. After I grew up, I was forced to marry a country woman who was illiterate, short, and ugly. I have no feelings for her at all. I have asked for a divorce several times, but without success. Considering the circumstances of both families, it seems difficult to resolve this through proper channels. Therefore, I plan to publish a statement in the newspaper to sever the marital relationship. If the other party does not deny this statement within a certain period, will this statement be legally effective? In the future, will there be no interference from either family regarding our marriages? Please provide public guidance so that I may follow it.</p>
<p>Answer from Lawyer Zhu Ya: The requirements for divorce are clearly stipulated in Article 1052 of the Civil Code. Your reasons and methods do not meet the requirements for divorce. Although you are dissatisfied with the country woman, a wife's virtue and gentleness are paramount. If you can guide her well, you may have a happy future. The parents of both parties have no right to interfere legally.</p>
