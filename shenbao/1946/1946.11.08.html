<h3>策反投機終難倖免　周逆佛海判處極刑</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕奉行一兩面政第」多「才」善變之周逆佛海，於七日晨經首都高等法院宣判，處死刑，褫奪公權終身，全部財產除酌留家屬生活費外，沒收。晨八時周逆及羅逆君强解抵朝天宮，羈於候審室之套間中，八時五十分首由庭長駱允協偕推事葛召素，李　安，女書記官黄叔　開合議庭於大成殿，調査羅逆罪行，提周逆作證，五分鐘後周逆於憲警監押下，穿過人設立於受訊問人席。周逆衣深藍布抱，靑嗶嘰小袷襖褲，灰毛襪，黑圓口皮鞋。御黄邊眼鏡，態度安閑，神色自若。庭上先對其與羅逆關係及羅逆担任僞職情形加以審訊後，並詳究其與羅逆合作參加策反工作，毒殺李士羣，供給軍事情報諸事。九時十五分復提審羅逆，二犯所供無人差錯，且鎭定多言，詔笑表功之神情亦多相似。繼由證人王克修（即馬光曾），陳述其在淪陷時，任滬市黨部文運會委員，從事地下工作，策組建國社；及設法使滬市黨部書記長　克信自羅逆處獲得情報兩事情形。證人張俊生陳述其受命軍統局與羅逆聯絡情形，張並證明所提證件中戴故局長親筆信屬實，（信中諸多慰勉，並有「此間一切當由弟負其責也」句。）旋宣讀筆錄後，於十時半退庭。</p>
<p>十時三十五分庭長金世鼎，推事王鴻全申屠辰開合議調査庭，再度提審周逆佛海，爲楊逆惺華案作證。周逆先對檢舉田任全營私舞弊案否認，謂其記憶中絕無此事。復對楊逆協助其工作，取得並傳遞敵人進犯湘桂戰略之情報諸事加以陳述。至十一時十五分偵訊完畢。周案主辦檢察官陳繩祖參加原庭開始宣判。</p>
<p>全法庭人衆起立後，金庭長即以莊肅堅決之語氣宣讀判決主文：「周佛海共同通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國，處死刑。所有財產，除酌留家屬必需生活費外，沒收」。</p>
<p>周逆以極度緊賬神神情聆判後，面色焦黄而力持鎭靜，金庭長續讀判決理由一段，並轉以撫慰之聲調謂：「被吿情節重大，位置重要，本院依法秉公衡判，乃處以極刑。唯此並非最後定案，依法尙須呈由最高法院覆判決定。萬一如法律方面絕對無可轉園，中央體念策反功勞，或尙可以行政櫂量情處分，予以特赦减刑亦未可知」。辭畢，即諭將周逆還押，時爲十一時三十分，周逆緊閉雙唇，圓瞪兩眼，狺狺然步出法庭，由　害自人業中押返候審室”並即　羅逆同車被解還老虎橋看守所。</p>
<p>高院院長檢察官　認判處至爲公允</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕周逆判死刑後，此間反應良好，咸感法院執法嚴平，而認周罪有應得。宣判時五千餘旁聽民衆，聞判後，均各領首，直至周解去後，猶紛紛議論，對高院尊重國家法律，維護民族正氣，於詳盡硏討後，毅然以極刑加諸巨奸之精神，備極崇揚，而對周之神通廣大，金財富有，必將極力活動免死一點，不無顧慮。周案審判長趙琛院長，於宣判後談稱：「周逆頗具才幹，如遵從抗戰國策，服從領袖指導，効忠國家，其政治前途實未可限量，乃以意志不堅，反見投機，終以漢奸治罪，就惜才言，實深遺憾，但法院在法言法，周叛國罪行確鑿，無法可　，故處以極刑。至以政治權利減刑之可能，端視當局如何衡斷。視法國法庭判決賴伐爾及貝當死刑之例，此兩法奸之功，應不下於周逆，伹賴伐爾仍難倖免，僅貝當以前次大戰中健有殊勳，且年近就木，得邀戴高樂特赦減刑，故當局對此次政治權利之運用，亦必細考民意，詳徵興論，而予以極愼重之選擇」。又經辦周案起訴之陳繩祖檢察官吿本報記者：「周逆之應判死刑，實不應稍有疑測，蓋司法機關只知法律不計其他，倘以周之罪大惡極，猶可偉免一死，誠有損法律尊嚴，本人亦必提起上訴。余意周案經此睿智之判決，當已成定讞，諒最高司法當局及行政方面，均將重視國家紀綱民族正氣及國人之公章，而不致使此翻覆投機之敗類，有所僥倖也一。</p>
<h3>周佛海宣判前後　未宣判前要求公平判斷　判死刑後熱淚涔涔而下</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕七日是巨奸局逆佛海定讞的日子，建鄴路上，人山人海，尤其是新開記者特別活躍，以期獲取在肅奸上僅有互奸的最後宣判的鏡頭。　這幾天來，首都人士對周逆佛海的判處，推測紛紜，「死刑」，「無期徒刑」，「無罪開釋」，在每個人腦海裏打觔斗，這一個謎，祇有在大成殿上才能揭曉。</p>
<p>這幾天來，忙了周逆家屬，也忙了辯護律師。肅奸當局最近曾接到高院轉來周逆辯護的一段事實，他說：「當湘桂戰爭緊急的時候，他會有秘密情報，供給軍統局，供出敵人調動軍隊，發動大規模掃　戰，曾由軍統局轉報中央。」軍統局接到是項公文，當然是要答復的，但以當時事實上觀察，如果周佛海當時旣有情報，湘桂撤退，自然沒有那樣慘重。我們再看首都高等法院的審訊，趙院長及陳檢察官對他駁斥得體無完膚，賣國通敵的第一號漢奸、當然要遭受國法最嚴厲的極刑，絕無疑問。</p>
<p>昨天一大早，記者就趕到老虎橋監獄等候，八點多鐘，檢察官率領法警及內警總隊調來的警察一隊十餘人，開着日本式的大卡車來了。記者隨着他們到了忠字監獄，這時周逆佛海，羅逆君强，丁逆歟邨都一起來了，羅君强頭髮梳得油光亮亮的，當年的「部長」風度猶存。周逆佛海昨天換上藍布夾袍，態度也顯得瀟洒。羅君强是再度受鞫的，丁逆默邨站在一旁，精神上很不痛快，消息毫無，不知是好是壞，很難受的樣子。也曾因爲吞吞吐吐的問了法警一聲：「我的消息怎樣？」法警自然不會理會他的，當周佛海，羅君强解出以後，丁逆還說：「周大哥，希望你帶回來好消息」，言下不勝凄酸。</p>
<p>八點三十分由老虎橋起解了，周逆佛海，羅逆君强坐在司機座旁，有談有笑。恰巧司機座旁的玻璃破了一個洞，記者利用這個方便，經過法警的許可，開始和周談話：</p>
<p>「聽說近來與論對你不大好，你有什麼感覺？」</p>
<p>「自己的事當然自己知道，不過我自首是事實，與中央聯絡，蔣主席也淸楚。」</p>
<p>「你與軍統局聯絡，聽說是「兩面倒」，到底是怎麽一回事？」</p>
<p>「程克群沒死，可以問他，軍統局的周鎬，曾在堂上替我作證，當然是不會假的。」</p>
<p>「庭上宣布你對軍統局聯絡，完全是你通謀敵國，洩漏本國秘密的手段，你作何解釋？」</p>
<p>「說起來很難講，不過電台不易建立，情報不易獲取，他指的恐怕就是這個吧！」</p>
<p>「今天堂上會判你的是「死刑」，「無期徒刑」抑「無罪」呢？」</p>
<p>「那很難說。」</p>
<p>「假如判死刑呢？」</p>
<p>「願遵國法，不過秤要秤得公平。」</p>
<p>朝天宮到了，在人聲混雜中結束了我們的談話。</p>
<p>大成殿上以及廣場以內，人還是那麽擁擠，不同的祇是沒有廣播器。九點鐘審判長升堂了，先來審訊羅逆君强。庭上一邊問一邊駁，羅逆君强頗爲沮喪，周佛海與羅君强是一道的，都有連帶關係，替羅逆作證，自無異替他自已伸雪一番。薛誦齊律師，曾替羅逆提上有力的證據，聲言是軍統局戴故局長的親筆。記者看他這一遞，知道是粗大的鋼筆字。堂上念了一念：「君强吾兄偉鑒，多年不晤，時切馳思，俊生兄來，獲悉吾兄年來苦心爲國，關懷舊雨，甚佩甚慮。時至今日，實爲頻年來在敵寇脅迫之下，實有志之士効忠國家，効忠領袖之最好時機，務請聯絡各方有志之士，團結所能掌握之一切有用力量，適應時機，協同行動，此間當由弟負其責也。餘由俊生同志面陳，敬頌大社，弟雨上，七月廿九日。」張俊生今天也在爲他作證，這一段文字念了以後，羅君强顯得得意。結束了一堂，又升第二堂，書記官宣讀了紀錄，審判長起先問了間關楊惺華及其他的事情。</p>
<p>十一時一刻，陳檢察官到堂上，審判長金世鼎，以很大的聲音宣布「宣判」，這時聽衆們起了一陣騷動。周逆佛海站在被吿台上，一動不動。審判長隨即宣讀，周逆佛海判處死刑的主文。周逆戰戰兢兢動了一下。金審判長繼續說着「周佛海，本院判你的死刑，你還可以上訴最高法院，最高當局，他們可以减刑，你也許不會死的。」宣布退庭，周逆一言不發，昂昂然退了下去，法警押到車上，記者終於在離開朝天宮前一剎那，又與周逆作了一次談話。記者問他：</p>
<p>「判處死刑你有什麽感覺？」</p>
<p>「這是國法，不過秤太偏傾了一點，難道我的功不要嗎？」</p>
<p>「你還上訴嗎？」</p>
<p>「是。」</p>
<p>「審判長最後的話你聰到嗎？」</p>
<p>「聽到的，先生，我周佛海的命運不在今天，在戴故局長死的那一天已經註定了。我的行動祇有戴故局長最淸楚。他在，他可以替我挑起祖子，如今他死了，又有什麽，我死，我更惜戴將軍，中國特出的特工人才。審判長的話，也許是寬寬我的心的。」周逆此時流下淚，一點一滴的流下來。</p>
<p>法警催司機開車，周逆佛海在記者的詢問下，替記者在拍紙本上留下「十年以後眞知我」七個字。周逆佛海將難免爲老虎橋畔林柏生·梅思平之續吧！</p>

<h3>社論　從美國選舉看我國憲法</h3>
<p>美國普選結果傳到中國，正值國民大會決定如期開會的時候，依照政府當局迭次的發言，此次國民大會的召開，其主要的目的，端在制定國家根本的大法，此即所謂憲法。說來也真覺得遺憾的事，民國肇造，於今已有三十五年，而我們還沒有一部憲法。這可並不是就說，我們的國家還沒有一部根本的大法。自國民革侖之師肅清了我國的軍閥封建勢力以後，按照國父的遺教，即己進入訓政時期；在此時期，我們本有訓政時期約法作爲國家的根本大法，憲法之所以不曾指定便因爲訓政時期的不曾結束，而訓政時期之所以不曾結束，却是因爲日本的侵略與全面抗戰的燥　。如今日寇的侵略既已失敗，我國的抗戰亦已勝利，所以我國憲法的制定一直要到勝利以後緣有國民大會的召開來制定憲法。在這以前，中國不是沒有制憲的企圖，但在軍閥割據，封建勢力猶復猖狂的情勢下，憲法的制定，彷彿跡近兒戲，所以我們看見有憲法的制定，隨即有憲法的毀棄；因循至今，也已有了三十多年。如今國民大會既將如期召開，而在召開之前又適逢美國選舉結果的根曉；由於這次選舉的結果，已　起一般人對於美國憲法的注意。此次國民大會召開的目的既在制憲，則由於美國選舉的結果而引起的對於美國憲法的批判，應該足爲國民大會制憲的參考。</p>
<p>這次美國選舉所引起的關於美國憲法的問題，其最具體的一個例子，莫若參議員福爾勃來的建議，要求杜魯門總統辭職，其理由謂共和黨已在參眾兩院占優勢，杜魯門應即任命共和黨議員爲國務卿，並辭去總統職務。同時，據報載消息　英國報紙對美國政治的三權分立，成以複雜的說法加以討論，語氣之間，充滿此種制度已不入時之批許。這的確是一個值得注意探討的問題。參議員福爾勃來的言論充其量祗能代表個人的私見，但這里却　藏着極嚴重的問題。這就是：如果選舉能代表人民的公意，則此大美國的選舉已經指出美國人民的意向在共和黨，而不在執政的民主黨。若使同樣情形　生在英國，則在朝執政的黨便立刻退居在　，　得到人民擁護的黨執政，去年英國的普選，就是因爲工黨在國會趕得了控制的多數，使年高望　的邱吉爾及其所統率的保守黨一羣不得不自動下野，讓在普選中獲勝的工黨執政，這是不成文的英國憲法。但在美國，受了十八世紀政治理想的影響而制定的憲法，三權鼎力，界限分明；所以縱使這次普選的結果人民傾向共和黨，但杜魯門總統依舊有兩年未滿的任期，所以這次選舉的結果，並沒有影饗於政府的改組。杜魯門總統及其所統率的民主黨，雖得不到人民的擁護，依舊至少還可以戀棧兩年。在這兩年內，共和黨在國會既占有絕對多數，則身隸少數黨而爲行政苜長的杜魯門總統必將遭遇嚴重的難關。第一次世界大戰後威爾遜總統所逢到的遭遇，不期又重演於今日。</p>
<p>因此，這次美國選舉的結果，應該給我國行將制定的憲法以意義深長的敎訓。這就是，第一我們不應拘泥於陳腐的政治理想，必須從那些不合時宜的政治理想中解放出來；第二我們應該珍視我們民族先覺的遺產，而應該制定一種既不因襲外國成規，同時又適合我國國情足以樹一典範的國家根本大法。美國以三權　力抑制均衡爲特微的憲法，既不足爲法，英國的制度以及別國的政制也未必能應我國的需要。蘇維埃制度的產生在蘇聯有其歷史的背景，英國制度的出現在英國也自有其歷史的因素。凡此，均不是我們中國可以因襲的。我們必須從這些偏見或成見中解放出來，而自行制定我們國家的根本大法。</p>
<p>幸運的是我們的國父孫先生早已看到這點，因而有五權憲法的遺教。這真是我們一份寶貴的遺產，既沒有三權鼎立的流弊，又沒有一權獨占的惡果；權能分界，系屬謹嚴。對於這份寶貴的遺產，我們應該如何珍視！但不幸國人對於這份寶貴的遣產，猶未能加以珍視。立法院所制定經國民政府頒布的「五五憲章」本位三民主義五權憲法理想的表現，而「政協」諸公。這實在是一件極遺憾的事。當然「五五憲章」雖經立法院再三審議，老慮不壓求詳，其中誠不免容有尚未妥到之處；但五權精神及權能學說卻不容絲毫變動。如今國民大會既將如期召開獨腳艱熾將蟈鱉黝餅嘰張霧駟體歡撫憾能夠不陷外國的成規，將我們所有的這份寶貴遺產的精神充分表現出來，以　國家長治久安之基。</p>
<h3>普選後的美國內政及外交</h3>
<p>美國參眾兩院議員改選，於本月五日舉行，各州開票初步結果，在野十四年的共和黨，竟能壓倒民主黨而獲得勝利；不但足以控制參眾兩院，而且對於一九四八年總統競選必能獲勝的信念，也益形增強了。</p>
<p>這次共和黨的獲勝虛在意料之中，杜魯門總統的失敗，可謂與第一次大戰後威爾遜總統的失敗，如出一轍。美國人民在民主黨的執政之下，巳歷十四年之久，對於民主黨的內政外交政策及其一貫的作風，早已發生厭倦；而希望換一個政黨出來執政，由來已久，所以共和黨的這次獲勝，是決非偶然的，實可謂適逢其時。捨此而外，還有下訓幾項因素：（一）大戰結束之後，美國人民的視綫已自國外移至國內；戰時所注意的，是軍事的勝利與外交的成功；但是戰後所關心的，是內政的革新與經濟的復興。英國於去年五月舉行普選，工黨所以能壓倒保守黨，其原因也就在此。英國人民久在保持黨執政之下，早巳感覺到「夠了」，故要工黨出來秉政；此在中國人民久在民主黨執政下，也早已感覺到「夠了」，故要共和黨出來執政。（二）杜　門總統雖亦屬於民主黨，而且曾一再表示，其所採取之政策，仍我乘了故總統羅斯福的遺志；但是不可否認的，杜魯門總統並未能完全繼續推行羅斯福的政策。例如他放棄了物價管制政策，而使美國物價普遍土漲，一般人民的生活，均感困難，因要求增加工資而發生工潮，也就層出不窮。所以杜魯門總統早已失去了人民的信任，這次民主黨的失敗，也是必然的結果。（三）人事關係的迭次發生摩擦，也足以削弱杜魯門總統在國內的地位與聲望。杜魯門總統與國會失和，常常引起白宮與國會發生意見，總統雖然一再運用否決權，但是往往欠缺圓滑，致使民生黨內部也發生裂痕。同時在政府本身，爲了外交政策問題，前任商務部長華萊士竟舉國務卿貝爾納斯鬧意見，華氏雖然掛冠他去，而由哈里曼繼任，但是美國政府，經過一次軒然大波之後，政府內部的裂痕，成爲無法彌補的了。這也足以減低杜魯門總統的威望的。是美國第八十屆國會開幕之後，參眾兩院就完全在共和黨的控制之下了；但是杜魯門總統離開任期屆滿之時，尙有整整的兩年；在這兩年之間，杜魯門總統推行任何政策，均將遭到國會的牽制。尤其在內政方面，共和黨對於杜魯門總統的政策，頗多不滿之處。例如：（一）保持義務兵役制問題；（三）海陸兩軍實行合併問題；（三）加緊進行造屋以解決房荒問題；（四）財政平衡問題；（五）物價管制問題；（六）解決工潮及失業間題；（七）減低戰時高稅率問題。國會與政府因爲上述各項問題而發生爭執，即將層出不窮了。杜魯門總統在於這種環境之下，如何自處？的確是一個嚴重問題。誠如前總統胡佛說；「最近數年以來，整個世界，包括美國在內，一直在計劃　　經濟酌全能之路上向左走，但是現在的美國，經過這次普選之後，將爲放棄此一路綫第一國矣。」前任商務部長華萊士也說：「在共和黨佔優勢下的國會，將使美國經濟問題，益形複雜了。這次普選的結果，使民主黨不能進步，就要陷於減亡。」</p>
<p>在外交政策方面，共和黨的獲勝，不致受有重大影饗。因爲國務卿貝爾納斯所採取的政策，受共和黨參議員范登堡的影響甚大，美國代表團出席任何國際會議，不論是外長會議或巴黎和會，甚至聯合國大會，范登堡奧斯　受范登堡的指使，蘇聯報紙或電台近來抨擊美國現行政策，亦以共和黨爲新的戰爭燭動者爲言。攻擊范登堡本人，更是不遺餘力。所以法國政界人士開及共和黨獲勝的消息，即表示焦慮，咸以美國對蘇聯態度是否益加強硬爲問。法國左派人士亦以美國將不願在經濟上協助歐洲各國爲憂。這些憂慮，似乎決非杞人憂天。同時在英國外交觀察家，也說貝爾納斯仍將推行現行外交政策，質言之，即一方面，美國不願單獨對蘇聯讓步；另一方面，美國對於蘇聯勢力範圍以內所發生之政治，亦不願熟視無睹。所以預料美國今後的外交政策，不致有重大變化，而美蘇關係，也未必能立即有好轉的希望，誠如蘇聯的紅星報評論美國普選稱；「美國民主黨與共和黨，今日己無多大差別，此可於美國對蘇聯所採取之強硬對於－九四八年的總統競選增加無限的希望，以美國政治而論。確是一個重大的變動；但是在其外交政策方面，很少有影響。因爲在今日的美國，雖有共和黨與民主黨之分，在內政上各有不同的政策；但是對於外交的意見，却是完全一致的。杜魯門總統對於外交政策的決定，向來尊重共和黨的意見；所以今後國會與政府之間，對於內政或者會引起爭議，但對於外交政策是不會引起分歧的。</p>

<p>周佛海共同通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國，處死刑，擺奪公權終身全部財產，除酌留家屬必需生活費外，沒收。</p>
<p>事實</p>
<p>有意背叛　違反旣定國策</p>
<p>周佛海在日本留學時期，原係共產黨黨員，後改人國民黨，歷任國民革命軍總司令部政治部主任，江蘇省政府委員兼教育廳　長，　中央民衆訓練部部長，及中央宣傳部部長等職。民國二十六年，中日戰事發生，敵勢披猖，淞滬戰事激烈之際，周佛海與梅思平高宗武等，在其家內（南京西流灣八號）密議主和，當時曾有低調俱樂部之稱。迨京滬失守，國民政府決定長期抗戰，西遷重慶以後，即存心違反中央旣定國策，以汪逆兆銘爲中心，醞釀和平運動，更趨積極。首由梅思平高宗武於二十七年十一月中旬潛赴上海，向日本軍部代表影佐禎昭，及今井武夫，商得喪權辱國之和平基本方案，遂於十一月二十七日，由滬轉港飛渝，密陳汪逆。經汪逆認可後，周佛海有意背叛中樞，假託中央宣傳部部長出外視察名義，先於十二月六日離渝前往昆明，同月十九日轉赴越南河內。而汪逆亦於二十日飛逃河內。二十三日，敵國首相近衛文營，果以梅思平等所商得之條件發表聲明，汪逆亦即擬就　電，交由周佛海陳公博等携至香港，轉交林柏生與梅思平一同署名負責，於三十日夜送往）報館發表，（因顧孟餘反對，躭擱一日），響應近衛之聲明，冀圖淆惑聽聞，動搖抗戰決策。</p>
<p>與敵密議　始終追隨汪逆</p>
<p>二十八年四月十二日，周佛海與梅思平同至上海，結集黨羽，推進和運，旋高宗武與汪逆亦先後到滬，復與影佐　昭等商得敵國當局之同意，周佛海梅思平高宗武周隆庫等隨同汪逆，飛往日本東京，與敵首密議和平條件。歸國後，復以和平反共建國爲號召，在滬開第六次僞中國國民黨全國代表大會，發表宣言，周佛海被推選爲偽中央執行委負會常務委員。至十一月間，偕梅思平林柏生周隆庠高宗武等與日方代表影佐禎昭及須賀等，商訂「中日基本關係條約草案」。嗣後高宗武等良心發現，沿至香港，在大公報揭破內幕，即逃往後方。而周佛海執迷不悟，始終迫隨汪逆左右。二十九年一月二十日，出席靑島會議，與「臨時」「維新」兩僞政府會商改組問題。又參加同年三月二十日至二十二日之僞中央政治會議，決定中日新關係調整方案，僞國民政府政綱，僞中央政治委員會及僞華北政務委員會組織條例，並決定僞國民政有名稱，推定各院部人選。</p>
<p>歷任偽職　仰承日寇意旨</p>
<p>至三月三十日，以國民政廣還都方式，合組僞國民政府於南京，並發表我國國民政府對內對外各種政令及條約協定等一槪無効之宣言，由汪逆自任主席兼僞行政院院長，周佛海任僞財政部部長，又先後兼任僞國民黨中央黨部執行委員會常務委員，僞中央財務委員會主任委員，僞中央政治委員會委員兼秘書長，僞最高國防會議委員兼秘書長，僞軍事委員會委員，僞行政院副院長，偽中央儲備銀行總裁，僞稅警總團總團長，僞敵產管理委員會委員長，僞物資統制審議委員會委員長，僞軍事委員會副委員長。淸鄕委員會委員，僞上海特別市市長兼偽上海保安司令曁上海特別市警察局局長等職，大權在握，極得汪逆　信。其在僞職期內，仰承日寇意旨，濫發僞幣，擾亂金融，供給敵人金錢物資，以增加敵寇侵略之實力。僞國民政府於二十九年十一月三十日在南京與日寇正式簽訂「中日基本關係條約」，允許日寇在蒙疆華北駐兵，並在我國領海內河屯駐艦隊，及實行經濟提携，同時發表中日滿共同宣言，承認僞滿洲國，以破壞我國領土之完整。三十年六月十四日，周佛海隨汪逆訪問日本朝野，訂立偽中央儲備銀行在外資金換算日元協定，並借得日元三億元，以支持僞府之經濟。太平洋戰事爆發後，附和日寇，於三十二年一月九日以偽國民政府名義，對盟邦英美宣戰。同年十月卅日與日寇締結同盟條約，聲明同生共死。周佛海復以特使名義訪問僞滿，藉以媚敵。其他種種禍國殃民之罪惡，不勝枚舉。周佛海自附從汪逆，公然主和，直至日寇投降，僞組織解體，始終參與其事，經軍事委員會調査統計局誘捕，移送本院檢察官起訴。</p>
<p>理由</p>
<p>本件被吿周佛海，對於右開附從汪逆兆銘，違反中央旣定國策，私自主和，與日寇密議喪權辱國之條件，以至共同組織僞國民政府，簽訂「中日基本關係條約」，允許日寇在我國領域內駐兵駐艦，實行經濟提携，曁發表中日滿共同宣言，承認僞滿洲國，破壞領土之完整，以僞府名義對盟邦英美宣戰，被吿以僞特使名義訪問僞滿，其主持之僞中央儲備銀行發行僞劵四萬一千億元，禁止人民使用法幣，擾亂金融，供給敵人金錢物資，以及擔任黨政兩方各項重要僞職，直至日寇投降爲止等情，均經在似査或審判中詳細自白不諱，旦有僞「國民政府公報」，僞「財政部公報」，僞宣傳部編印之「和平反共建國文獻」「汪主席訪日言論集」「汪主席訪日紀念畫刋一「選都第四年畫報」，及日人吉田濟藏編輯之「華中現勢」等刊物記載可證（另編目錄附於本判決之後）。此外組織偽府以後，　顏事敵，爲虎作倀，禍國殃民之惡跡，不但當時各種僞公文及報紙之託截，在在足以證明，而且爲中外人士所共見共聞，是該被吿與汪進等共同通謀敵國，圖謀反抗本國之事實，已屬彰明昭着，盲可認定無疑。惟應審究者，被吿所持辯解之理由，能否成立是已，茲分別論列於次：</p>
<p>不容狡辯　偽府禍國殃民</p>
<p>（一）據辯稱，組織偽府藉以試探和平，動搖敵寇軍心，爲淪陷區人民减少痛苦，且在淪陷區組織僞府，於抗戰陣營並無任何影響云云。査抗戰到底，爲中央旣定國策，民國二十六年十一月十二日，國民政府移駐重慶宣言，內有「邇者暴日更肆貪黷，分兵西進，逼我首都，觀其用意，無非欲挾其暴力，要我爲城下之盟，殊不知我國爲決抗戰自衛之日，即已深知此爲最後關頭，爲國家生命計，爲民族人格計，爲國際信義與世界和平計，皆已無屈服之餘地，凡有血氣，無不具寗爲玉碎，不爲瓦全之決心。國民政府茲爲適應戰况，統籌全局，長期抗戰起見，本日移駐重慶，此後將以最廣大之規模，從事更持久之戰鬥」等語，昭吿全國上下。該被吿會受高等敎育，在黨政各界均有相當地位，尤其是當時擔任中共宣傳部部長，一言一動，均足以影響中外之觀聽，乃竟與汪逆等背叛中樞，組織僞府，且發表「抗戰到底，底是什麼？底在那裏？如不願談和，那何異說要抗戰到亡呢」等歪曲言論，（見被吿自撰回憶與前瞻一文，載在和平反共建國文獻內），欲以自己不眞確之認識，而淆惑全國之聽聞，企圖减低抗戰情緒，一時人心爲之動搖，使非中央領導有方，則抗戰陣營不因而崩潰者幾希，今猶謂爲試探和平，無碍抗戰，將自欺歟，抑欺人歟。至僞府在淪陷區一切措施，如招募僞軍，公賣雅片，搜括物資，奴化靑年，假借淸鄕，實施封鎖，凡此種種，無一而非禍國害民之舉，竟亦謂爲拯救人民，解除痛苦，允歷顚倒是非。再自僞府成立後，編練僞軍，不獨鞏固敵軍後方，而且助敵攻我防地，以致敵燄愈熾，侵入益深，被吿所謂動搖軍心者，其結果適得其反，事實具在，不容狡辯也。</p>
<p>所謂自省　不合條件事實</p>
<p>（二）據辯稱，被吿曾於三十一年冬，託人向中央自首，供給軍事情報，設立電台，佈置軍事，配介國軍反攻，營救中央地下工作人員，及協助中央發展淪陷區黨務文化云云。査該被吿早於二十八年十一月四日，經最高法院檢察署明令通緝有案，並非在犯罪發覺前自動投案而受審判。且漢奸自首條例規定，更有嚴格的特別條件，其第一條載漢奸於發覺前自首，合於左列各款之一者，得免除其刑或免其刑之執行：（二）檢舉其他漢奸案件，經判決確定，戚査獲重要證據確有價値者。（二）揭發漢奸或間諜之險謀策略，確實可信者。（三）密吿敵方機密，確有利於本國者。（四）携帶軍器來獻者，試問該被吿曾否有上開四種情形之一之事實表現’而能提出確切之證據乎。况據各證人之證言及書面陳述，在三十年冬被吿會有自首之意思，未能達到中央，而以後之目首，又經軍統局覆函證明並無其事實，是該被吿所稱自首一節，旣與條件不合又與事實不符，自可毋庸置議。</p>
<p>預備反攻　更屬無功可表</p>
<p>至營救地下工作人員，密報敵情，聯絡國軍，配合盟軍，預備反攻。及發展淪陷區黨務文化各節，就各證人之證言及書面陳述而論，亦屬似是而非。自太平洋戰事發生後，該被告或徇私人之交誼，或有其他之作用，固曾偶一援手營救少數之中央地下工作人員，但數年來地下工作人員被敵僞捉捕而犧牲者，不知凡幾，京滬一帶，殆已一網打盡，其受營救能爲之證明者，不過寥寥數人，權衡利害，有何協助抗戰工作，或有利人民行爲之可言乎。誠如證人馬元放證明函內所云，不敢以其對於個人之私，影響國家之公也。又據第一保安縱隊，第二保安縱隊，第三保安縱隊各司令部來函，證明緊切連繫密商策應國軍反攻等情，姑無論與國防最高委員會核准所示「反奸人員須由各部隊或特工人員之最上級長官正式證明，事前派委有案，方予准許」之案不合，即該各部隊之本身，亦因日寇屈服投降，未獲反攻之機會，不曾建立殊勳，而被吿更屬無功可表。復査軍統局一覆函及移送書，亦僅謂被吿因其母及岳丈楊自容均被捕押，爲圖營救，並爲將來留地步計，表示其行動之錯誤，經奉准策動運用以來，能度冷淡，初無成績表現，再經多方　劃，加强運用，始對地下工作人員加以掩護，並有小量經費之接濟。此與陸軍總司令部覆函所謂，被吿於三十三年秋曾用書函表示願運用僞軍，相機反正，配合國軍反攻，業經密報中央等等情形相同。然被吿所願策應之地域，盟軍旣未登陸，僞軍更未反正，是該被告與中央方面發生連繫則有之，而協助抗戰則未也，決不能以未來之事實，據爲卸罪之地步，彰彰明甚。該被吿因見盟軍節節勝利，敵勢窮促，始與中央所屬人員稍有連繫，但査其在後之言論行動，仍極盡反抗中央詆毁政府之能事，徒見其騎墻觀望，兩面投機而已，若論淪陷區黨務文化，尤堪痛恨，當時僞組織爲吸收民衆而辦黨務文化，莫非仰承敵人意旨，養成奴性靑年及推行奴化敎育，豈可認爲有利人民之行爲乎。是該被吿所提出之反證，認爲有調査之必要者，均經一一審核，殊不足供量刑之參考。</p>
<p>發行偽幣　民衆損失不貲</p>
<p>（三）據辯稱，發行偽中央儲備券，爲抵制敵人濫發軍票，搜括物資，統制物價云云。殊不思敵人行使軍票，僅及於敵軍駐紥之少數據點，而不能深人民間，更不能向後方內地套取物資，即不能達統制搜括之目的，因此嗾使僞府發行僞劵，大量供給，以便其所圖，而被吿固有相當學識之人，對於此中利害，豈有不知之理。惟爾　被吿與在逆等意圖永久竊據國土，顚覆中央政府，正有操縱金融之必要，於是在互相利用情况之下，以僞府所謂之國家銀行發行僞劵，名之曰新法幣，以二對一比率掉換法幣，同時頒布妨害新法幣條例，禁止人民使用法幣，違者嚴厲處罰，一面無限制的發出僞劵，充斥市塲，以致物價逐。飛漲，哀我淪陷區人民之財產，無故驟减少一半，又受物價影響，無形中損失不貲。而日寇從此得向僞中央儲備銀行予取予求，雖名義上訂有借款協定，但其心目中不獨無還債之意思，並債權人之資格亦不承認。當初我後方內地，因敵僞以二對一掉換所獲法幣，向內地套取物資，一時物價突飛猛漲，金融動遂不安，必需物品日益减少，如非常局　籌碩畫，人民公忠體國，各具抗戰必勝信心，上下一心一德，應付適宜，則不屈服於軍事，亦必失敗於經濟矣，至今思之，猶有餘憾。（一般短視者現在猶怨物價之高漲，不知實爲日寇搜括物資，僞府發行僞幣之流毒）？此種惡跡，昭昭在人耳目，被吿縱有如簧之舌，亦無飾詞諉卸之餘地。抑有應予說明者，日寇已投降之後，該項僞幣尙儘量發出，（據供發行額爲四萬一千億元，已與報上發表之數目不符，其實決不止此數，現亦無從計算），所有僞府所屬區域各機關人員，概發解散費，如汪文嬰發到四萬萬元，馬驥良發到三千萬元，（均據供明有卷可稽）。即以二百對一換算，亦不爲少數，恐非一般小民所能及，必欲使劫後災黎增加姐許負擔，則主持發行僞幣如被吿者，不能不負重大之罪責。</p>
<p>共同正犯　簽約豈無責任</p>
<p>（四）據辯稱，與日寇簽訂條約，被吿只是參加，並無簽訂之　，對英美宣戰，都由汪逆一人全張，當時以僞特使名義訪問僞滿，所至各地俱懸國旗唱國歌，實屬有功，何得謂媚數云云。査該被吿與梅思平等，以汪逆爲中心，共同組織僞府，歷任要職，對於僞府發號處令，對內對外一切叛逆行爲，槪有意思之聯絡舉行爲之分　，自不能不負共同正犯之責任，何得以僅是參加，並無簽訂之權，而置身事外乎，又何得以對英美宣戰推在汪逆一人之身乎。且與日寇訂的，聲明同生共死，足以搖惑人心，與盟邦英美宣戰，使我中央抗戰陳營陷於孤立，均屬反抗本國之行爲，毫無疑義。至於當日僞滿完全在日寇勢力之下，縱使民衆偶然見到國旗，聽到國歌，亦無濟於事，被吿之訪問僞滿，其爲媚敵之表演，顯而易見，豈容任意狡展乎。</p>
<p>維持治安　中樞神機妙算</p>
<p>（五）據辯稱，勝利後被吿即被任爲上海行動總隊長，恪遵中央意旨，負責維持上海及滬杭沿綫一帶治安，防制奸僞，穩定人心，迨國軍與中央接收人員先後抵滬，即將所屬軍警全部交與中央接收，不無微功云云。査關於此點事實，據軍統局移送書及覆函所開，確係實情，但參照被吿提出之戴故局長先後函電，足見我最高統帥當初顧念淪陷區人民，八載以來顚沛琉離，癱苦萬狀，再不容正在勝利之際，遭受無謂之騷擾，以及避免其他種種損失起見，不得不有此權宜之計，此乃忽促應變之策略，亦爲謀國者之苦心，絕非對於罪大惡極之巨奸有所寬宥也。故當時中央廣播，凡敵僞佔據之區域，均實令原有敵僞軍隊官兵，務須守住崗位，維持地方秩序，不獨滬杭一帶爲然也。專就報載何總司令發表談話：「周佛海雖早經自首，因某在　組鐵所任職務重要，亦已加以看管」，及軍統局解案公函內開：「査周逆佛海，丁逆默邨，羅逆君張，楊逆惺華，馬逆驥良等五名，業經本局於去年九月三十日在滬誘捕到案，惟當時滬杭兩地受降國軍甫經一到達，奸匪環伺，人心浮動，如將周了兩逆在滬扣押，恐將影響周丁兩逆所掌握之僞稅警總團全部，及滬杭僞保安團隊，僞第十二軍之十二個團，僞警衛軍一三兩師等部隊官兵心理之不安，而影響滬杭兩地之治安，故奉准將周丁等逆派機解送重慶禁押，現各地巨奸均已就逮，用特派負押解周逆佛海等五名，速同原卷，備函送請査收，依法訊辦」各等語，參觀互證，更足見當初之措施，如何深思熟慮，審愼周詳，其用意何在。昭然若揭。乃被吿怙惡不悛，目無法紀，阻敢在答辯書內稱，「敵寇投降後，差不多一個多月，中央沒有一兵一卒到上海，在這個期間，不是沒有人勸被吿以上海做根據地，另立新幟，不得已也可以搜括上海的財富，把部隊帶往江北，今天很放肆的說，那個時候只要被吿一句話或一點頭，東南的風雲就要變色」，則其大逆不道、心懷叵測之狀態，躍然紙上，竟以勾結敵寇蹂躪八載猶不足，直欲實行搶刦糜爛地方面後快。於此益佩我中樞神機妙算，料事如神，卒使元惡巨憝俯首就範，計不獲逞也。</p>
<p>國人共棄　乃竟大言不漸</p>
<p>由此觀之，該被吿恃才善變，言不由裏，朝　暮楚，　詐多端，即　所主張如何願輸誠中央，協助抗戰，如何　　地下工作人員，如何設立電臺，供給情報，槪非眞實可信。又被吿所謂「只要一句話或一點頭，東南的風雲就要變色」，未知究何所指，即如日憲在華軍隊尙有百萬之譜，一經屈服，只得俯首貼耳，遵令繳械，該被吿所掌握之軍隊，不過數萬耳，即有所圖，亦無非快意於一時，豈能永久割據爲雄乎，况其部下之軍隊，不無深明大義，亦未必肯爲被吿所利用乎。若謂另有所指，則兄弟圍墻，外禦其侮，古有明訓，如被吿之賣國求榮，已爲國人所共棄，無論走南走北，走胡走越，終無肯與之携手者，乃竟大言不慚，挑撥離間，無所不用其極，似此反覆無一常，言之深堪痛恨，是被吿在勝利之後，維持地方治安，交出全部軍警，大勢所趨，不得不爾，有何功績之可言。</p>
<p>難掩巨過　莫蔽大辜</p>
<p>最後應予指明者，被吿一則曰政治論，再則曰法律論，似乎政治與法律截然兩途也者。要知政治者所以謀多數人之福利，法律者即政治之反映，如欲改革政治，應以合法之手續，運用多數人之意思，先行修改國法，斷不許違法亂紀，另樹政權，果如其說，則世界各國何必有政治犯之制裁，（不過依據國際公法，對於政治犯得拒絕引渡而已），而刑法內亦不必有內亂罪之規定矣。茲因該被吿平日言論荒膠，臨訊曉　　辯，惟恐庸耳俗　所不能測，不得不憚詞費詳予指駁，以袪天下後世之疑按日寇處心積處，併吞我國，匪伊朝夕，自九一八以後。節節進　，奪我東北四省，出兵內蒙，進窺平津，演成七七事變。我國民政府忍無可忍，起而抗戰，並決定寗爲玉碎，不爲瓦全，從事更持久之戰鬥，凡在血氣之倫，無不同仇敵愾。乃該被告　受中樞特達之知，迭膺要職，戰時正負宣傳使命，地位重要，宜如何同心協力，盡忠報國，竟於敵寇深入，國家危念之秋，脫離抗戰陣營，私通敵寇，甘心附逆，背叛中央，只圖逞個人政治之野心，不顧國家民族之存亡。若非中央堅持抗戰到底，最高統帥指揮右定，攻防得計，將使我國陷於萬却不復之地步，似此甘冒不韙，實屬法無可恕，縱樹微功，難掩巨過，偶施小憲，莫細大辜，欋衡輕重，量刑未便從寬，自應處以極刑，並褫奪公權終身，以伸國法尊嚴，而正人民視聽。全部財產除酌留家屬必需生活費外、併予沒收。</p>
<p>據上論結，應依特種刑事案件訴訟條例第一條，刑事訴訟法第二百九十一條前段，懲治漢奸條例第一條，第二條第一項第一款，第八條第一項，第九條，刑法第二條第一項前段，第廿八條，第卅七條第一項，判決如主文。</p>

<p>整個社會上的人士，對醫生的職業，總似乎很少有了解的。傳統的思想，都認爲行醫是一種慈善事業，他不僅要免費替人診病，而且還要施捨湯藥。苟如此，才合乎慈悲爲懷的宗旨。這在祖父父親輩的時代，確有這麼一回事的，因爲那時候的醫生是「需醫」，「書香子弟」偶爾讀罷傷寒論，騐方篇之餘，替親友們開個藥方，亦是何樂不爲的事。遇到貧病出不起錢，拿出自己的藥舖摺子，送幾帖藥亦無所謂，因爲在他們「老爺們」的眼中，行醫至多不過是一種「副業」而已—可是現在却大不同了。一個正式學校出身的醫生，要經過六年小學，六年中學，六年大學的讀書、徵調，考　，請領執照之後，在大醫院裏起碼工作過四五年，於是經騐學識兩相配合，行起醫來方不致誤人生命。要經過這二十幾年的栽培，要化掉這無量數的父兄金錢，他們才可以獨立。等到鬍鬚一把，他們要成家，他們要立業，在這種毫無經濟基礎的人身上，也要他們施診捨藥起來，就是耶穌再生，似乎也是無能爲力的了！他們要拿金條去頂房子，他們要拿以萬爲單位的法幣養家活口，如果不是上萬的進賬，何能收支相抵？</p>
<p>至於手頭拮据的朋友，很可不必模彷力腹便便之流，去請敎那些私人醫生。公家設有醫院，一年三百六十五日，一日二十四小時，無分日夜，開着大門，恭候病家光臨，掛號費「至多」以千計。可是多少人喜歡捨賤就貴，眞是想像不通。你說公家醫院不好，頂有名的醫生，誰也不是從公家醫院出來的。而且現在他們或許還在公家醫院任個兼職。然而人心如此，夫復何言！在診病的時候，常會被問到「醫生，你的辦公處在那裏，下趟到貴診所來請診如何」？這種「走後門」的惡習，已經成爲國人的慣性。好像在醫生家裏診病，遠較在醫院裏爲仔細點似的。不願挨次的等，要搶先，要賣面子，這是有錢人的花樣，然而沒錢的也想依樣葫蘆，豈不自討苦吃！</p>
<p>說來也是奇怪，「老實人」總是容易被人欺侮些的。世上有多少奸商投機，盜賊搶偸等等搗亂社會的事件在發生，與論對他們的責備遠不如對一個醫生，一個醫院所發生的一點小事來得嚴厲，不管這樁小事的究竟已經判明了沒有，你知道警察可單憑病人的訴說，隨便的到醫院裏抓護士捉醫生的事嗎？你知道以登報宣傳爲要挾要醫院出幾百萬「尊儀」作「賠償」的事嗎？當醫院宣告「客滿」，請病人易地診治的時候，有人會批評他「見死不救」，可是一個難民向店家要一碗飯，向旅舍寄一個身而彼咒咀出來的時候，又有誰會替他作正義的呼籲。世界上只有免費住院，减費出院的病人，却那有免費吃飯免費住宿的客人？有之，除非是「吃十方」的「記賬朋友」吧了！慈善慈善，慈善竟害煞了醫院。世上已沒有人肯慈善的化出一筆錢作醫院的經常費用，設免費病床，但却遍地呼聲要醫院擠出油來免費做好事。從茶房起直到醫師，醫院都要給他們一筆薪津，這雖然只可權作個人的點心零用，可是總數亦是一筆極大的開支。自古以來，恐怕從沒有一篇文章會替醫院，醫生呼籲過：請慈善家讓出一座公寓來作醫護人員的免費宿舍，請洗漿作免費替醫院洗滌被單衣服，請包飯作免費供給病人的伙食，請藥房免費供給病人的藥品，請大公司指助大批被單，衣料，給醫院，請………然而却偏偏要醫院免費收容病人。</p>
<p>再談醫生吧，請各位去醫院作一次訪問。他們的伙食足够營養嗎？他們的宿舍是否比學生更差一級？他們的衣着如何？他們的薪津除勉强能維持自身以外，還能另製一套新衣，另養一口家小嗎？他們含辛茹苦的在忍受，一年，兩年，五年，六年，爲前途在工作，可是你替他們想想看，他們的前途又是怎樣？你勸他們經商，不錯，眞有錢的醫生，他們的資產恐怕不單是從病人身上要來的吧！</p>
<p>講到病人，那些無病呻吟的光生們，他們太注重廣吿，要打補針，要吃補藥，愈貴愈好。診費講金條，計美金的醫生們反最爲他們欣賞。可是窮得像公家醫院的醫生一樣的那些夥計們，也想學學時髦，不注重本身體格的鍛鍊，單想憑藉「水粉胭脂粉刷門面」，眞是自討苦吃了。</p>
<p>在痛恨私人醫生取費昂貴的當兒，奉勸諸君更應愛護，獎勵公家醫院的發展。讓公家醫院的醫生們有足够養活家小的待遇，給他們有硏究探討學術的環境，則人民免費診病的享受才有事實的保障。不然的話，遍中國不會有一個像樣的醫院，相反的盡是被目爲敲竹槓的私人醫生。你不看把「公醫制度」喊得最響亮的那些大醫官兒們，現在也無聲無一臭的在大做其私人醫生了嗎？</p>

<p>誘導士兵樂於受訓</p>
<p>我看見本報十月二十九日讀者意見欄內有一簾「請軍官能愛護小兵」，我看了竟有些不相信起來，不相信有這般不講理的官長，我眞幸運我能得到一個賢明的主管而能享受着像父母長兄般給我的溫暖的天倫之愛。</p>
<p>我是一個聯合勤務總司全部南京第一被服補給庫的上等兵，自從入伍以來，天天由班長訓練，我們開始覺得很苦，日久亦習以爲常了。每天早晨由主官領導全體官兵升旗膳食，由二十七個官長組織膳食委員會，每天每人輪流採辦伙食後，親自監督伙夫烹調，至於飯菜官長一律平等，如職買用品，由消費合作社去採購。後園空地作爲農塲，種植蔬菜花卉，前面大院落佈置中山堂，堂中有圖書館，下棋處，無綫電，壁報，乒乓球桌，飯後公餘，可以隨意游戲，所以我們不想出去看電影，逛夫子廟了。每星期由長官領導開週會一次，由各股長輪流演講，所以我們懂得三民主義和怎樣愛國家愛老百姓。我們的總務股長是一個北京人，管理我們很嚴勵，不許我們隨意出去，不許我們亂化錢，如犯有過失，輕則訓責一番，重則罰跪或軍棍，我們見他很怕，個個人都有些恨他，但是他自己對於庫長很敬重，辦事一些沒有私弊。我們道他是很愛護我們的，他眞像我們的嚴父。至於我們的庫長是一個沉默寡言的四川靑年，他的住家離開庫房要有十幾里路，但是他到庫辦公總在七時以前，而且步行的，他生成玄黑的臉，穿了很樸素的服裝，從早到晚和藹可親。他在庫長室坐着辦公，寸步不離，一直到下午六時後方才回家去。他待我們好像家人一樣，他簡直是我們的慈母，我們眞把庫作爲我們的家了。倘然每個軍官都能像我們的官長，我想不再會有輕視士兵的觀念了。我以上一切所報吿的並非在和我們的長官在吹牛，可以請來實地調査一下。我希望公佈後給許多良心鐵做的官長看，讓他們自己知道慚愧，看樣和改進。（吳桂仙）</p>
<p>又是一個房客呼聲</p>
<p>鄙人住在善鐘路附近某號舖面前樓，這屋的二房東以前每三四月之間漲租一次。今年二月份已漲至五千元電燈，自來水尙許攤派，然而到九月份又藉口大房東要漲租，拒絕收受房金，十一月一日該二房東來語，自八月份起漲五倍半，小小一問前樓面，竟要二萬七千五百元，正是駭人聽聞的事。與之理論，亦置之不理，竟謂大房東要加多少，祗好照加，若然不照加，祇好搬塲，難道三四月之間要加租一次，憑着黑心二房東加租，任其擺佈暗取重利，眞沒有法律來裁制它嗎？最遭壓迫的是薪水階級，生活尙祇够維持，外加雪上加霜，重重壓迫，喘不過氣來。希望有關當局嚴禁濫加房金，並作規章曉諭，不使助長惡風氣。（文彬）</p>

<h3>共和黨決與民主黨合作　美國外交政策不變　內政上工農政策將受極大影響</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山七日廣播：杜魯門總統認爲此次國會選舉結果，對於政府之外交政策并無重大影響，因此點并非兩黨所爭執之問題。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山七日廣播：有經騐之政治觀察家認爲明年一月共和黨第八十屆大會開會時，將維持，甚至增強麥帥在日本之地位，馬帥在中國之和平努力，以及在朝鮮，中國東九省與歐洲，對蘇聯採取堅定之立場。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓七日專電〕此間共和黨諸領袖，在昨日全國選舉中，獲得壓倒勝利後，今日保證　等在政務方面，將與杜魯門及政府中民主黨官員忠誠合作。共和黨稱：合作係屬雙方性質，期望管理政務之民主黨員能以國家福利，置於黨派利益之上，并遒從人民意志，一如其在選舉時表示者然。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓七日電〕共和黨中央委會主席李斯今日談及該黨外交政策，略謂：下屆共和黨大會開會時，將以美國保持強盛之決心，昭示於世界，但以共和黨能確保民主黨現政府之合作爲條件。共和黨欲與其他各國合作，但本黨決心以一切代價保持美國之傳統，并保衛本國之利益。今日世界各處，多數人類自由遍受侵害，當此時也，美國人民轉向於真正自由主義之共和黨，殊堪欽佩。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約六日電〕共和黨領袖范登堡已在密　根州第四次當選連任參議員。據稱：共和黨之勝利，乃全國擁護兩黨聯合外交政策之表徵，自今而後，共和黨議員責任加重，不可不勉力以赴。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓六日電〕共和黨選舉得勝，該黨參議員范登堡大致將任參院議長，以繼現任民主黨籍議長麥克拉。參院外委會主席現屬民主黨籍參議員康納利，亦將以范氏承乏。許多觀察家預測：參院多數黨領袖民主黨參議員巴克萊，將由共和黨參議員塔　脫取而代之，塔氏并將兼任參院財政委員會主席。惟其他觀察家則以爲塔氏寧願主持綜合委員會。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓六日電〕共和黨選舉獲勝，將影響美國勞工及農業政策。據麻州共和黨眾議員馬丁今日宣稱：共和黨將討論更有效方法，使勞資雙方於絕對公允之原則下恢復融洽關係。　氏可能任眾院議長，其言已引起美國各方注意。共和黨曾宣稱：將竭力反對任何統制或津貼辦法，主張設法擴充市場。該黨或將提出有關擴大農作物市場之法案。</p>
<p>美大選後政權轉移　對蘇聯係將趨微妙</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約六日電〕共和黨選舉得勝，聯合國大會方面外交家認爲此事對美國外交政策至少可有三種影響：（一）范登堡將爲四外長會議及聯合國大會中美代表團之中堅份子。（二）全國現行外交政策雖爲民主共和黨一致政策，但共和黨既在國會佔絕對優勢，對外交政策之措施可以爲所欲爲，故其前途發展如何，殊難　料。（三）　國政權轉移，至少暫時將使美蘇　係處於微妙階段。某外交官曾代表西方某國出使莫斯科，今日宣稱：「美國此次選舉結果，在莫斯科方面似無多大意義。自范登堡參加聯合國機構美代表團之後，蘇聯方面早已明白美國祇有一個外交政策，此後將循一直綫進行。」</p>
<p>參議員福爾勃萊特　謂杜魯門應即辭職</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓七日電〕杜魯門總統偕妻女自米蘇里故鄉乘專車返華盛頓時，拒絕向記者發表關於選舉結果之意見，僅謂將於一二日內招待記者發表談話。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約六日電〕共和黨參議員福菉勃萊特，於共和黨選舉獲勝後稱：杜魯門今應任命一共和黨人爲國務卿，渠本人亦應辭總統職。杜魯門辭職後，將由國務卿繼任總統之職，本人並非要求杜魯門辭職，惟覺此爲對渠最爲有益之事云。按根據美國憲法，總統若死亡後，繼任之人依次當爲副總統國務卿及財長。</p>
<p>重演威爾遜時局面　國會白宮地位對立</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約六日電〕共和黨既於選舉戰中大敗民主黨，美國政府勢將大變動。共和黨政綱允許於一九四七年度國家預算中減少個人所得稅百分之二，政府支出項下則將節省一百萬萬元，俾使預算平衡；總統戰時權力亦將削減，糖等食品缺乏情形則將進行調查。全國人民對於物品統制，對共和黨競選諾言，自必樂於接受。該黨所得選票，自麻州以至加州，一瀉千哩，即南方各州素稱民主黨巢穴，亦遭波及。各地正在絡續檢點之票數，爲共和黨所得者仍在與時俱增。新國會於明年一月召集會議時，將在政治上與白宮處於對立地位，重演第一次世界大戰後威爾遜總統時代情形；惟依照美國政治　例，共和黨可望於兩年後入主白宮。</p>
<p>你們受用得夠了麼　共和黨競選的口號</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓七日電〕共和黨此次競選得勝，其噱頭有非民主黨所及。共和黨在各選區所揭　之口號曰：「你受用得夠了嗎？那麼投共和黨的票罷！」共和黨所謂夠了，意謂罷工夠多，物價夠漲，供應夠困難，尤其是共產黨之威脅夠大。觀察家認爲最後一項口實，佔共和黨得勝之一半功勞。</p>

<h3>胡佛華萊士各發表評語</h3>
<p>英法蘇與論一斑</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約六日電〕前共和黨總統胡佛評共和黨獲勝事稱：整個世界包括美國在內，數年來咸被　向左傾獨裁經濟之道路，美國經此次選舉後，爲首先起而反抗此一勢力之國家。前商長華萊士稱：共和黨控制下之衆議院，將增加吾國之經濟問題，前進的美國人將不得不向自由思想之領導者乞助。民主黨於此次選舉後，非變爲更前進，即爲宣告死亡，本人誠不願見民主黨死亡。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦七日廣播：蘇聯「眞理報」評論美國共和黨競選獲勝稱：美國反動派正在浪費羅斯福總統辛苦積聚之政治資本，此次選舉尤足證明美國現行外交政策實爲共和黨之外交政策。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦六日電〕今日倫敦各報均以大字標題宣布美國選舉結果，稱「美國已極度右傾。」法國報紙均以「杜魯門反對派奏凱」，「美國人民不信任杜魯門」等爲標題。倫敦晚報稱：美國於世界更向左傾之時，已戲劇式的突轉向右。</p>
<p>紐約州長杜威</p>
<h3>剩餘票數　無關大局</h3>

<h3>大選影響所及　紐約股票大跌</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約六日電〕就共和黨領袖所獲之票數觀，下屆總統候選人比較最有希望者，依次當爲紐約州長杜威，俄亥沃州參議員勃列克，及加里福尼亞州州長華倫。支持共和黨之人，皆認此次選舉後，右派份子在左傾世界中又獲抬頭。杜魯門政府將與國會形成較前更爲尖銳之對立狀態，而右派之抬頭，將使各項經濟統制完全撤銷，使大企業恢復「自由放任政策」時代之局面。紐約股票市場許多重要股票今晨均吿大跌。</p>
<h3>外長會議　義南陳辭</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約六日電〕南國外長西米克今日與義代表，一同出席外長會議，就特港問題陳述意見，西米克提出兩點有限制的讓步，（一）爲南國所可接受之東部邊界綫，可較原來商定者更爲東移，（二）撤銷特港總督須爲南人之要求。</p>

<h3>蘇聯革命紀念　紅場盛大閱兵　史達林并未參加慶祝儀式　柴達諾夫爲外交政策辯護</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科七日電〕本日爲蘇聯第廿九屆國慶日，此間絕色廣場舉行大規模軍事游行，步兵砲隊坦克車隊及「史達林」式巨型坦克車均參加。昨夜莫斯科大戲院舉行盛大慶祝式，但史達林元首并未參加。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦七日電〕蘇方電臺廣播慶祝情形，未說明史達林是否在場參加慶祝，倫敦泰晤士報今日推測史達林「或係遵醫生之囑」，不發演說。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦六日電〕莫斯科電臺稱：莫斯科市蘇維埃會議今日開會時，共黨中央委員會秘書柴達諾夫（按柴氏有史達林繼承人之目）蒞場發表演說，爲蘇聯之外交政策辯護，并指責英美阻止和平計劃之施行。渠謂世界民主力量之中心點蘇聯，竟成彼輩以戰爭爲牟利事業并恐懼民主勢力滋長者宣傳攻勢之目標。蘇聯目的之一，在建立強有力之聯合國機構，以防止侵略保持和平。蘇聯無時無刻，不在盡力建立強力持久合理之民主和平。柴氏演說時，首先述及國內狀況，謂蘇聯於戰後仍保持強大，戰後未發生危機者恐僅蘇聯一國。</p>

<h3>太平洋日委治各島　美決保持管理權　擬就託管協定草案交安理會討論</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓六日電〕杜魯門總統今日宣布：美國準備將美國現在控制之日本舊屬及其委治各島，全部移歸聯合國託管，美國僅須保留其管理權。美國并已擬就馬紹爾·加羅林及馬里亞納各代管島之「軍略區域」託管草約，即可提出聯合國安理會討論。此項草約並已分送安理會其他十理事國及紐西蘭與菲律賓，以供研究。至於原屬日本而非由舊國聯委治之各烏，美國似尚未草擬託管草約。各該島包括小笠原羣島，火山羣島與琉球半島，但總統聲明中暗示將來亦當草擬。政府中人之熟悉聯合國憲章者，稱「軍略區域」一語爲總統聲明之關鍵。依照聯合國憲章，凡屬軍略區域託管事宜應由安理會主持，其非軍略區域則由聯合國託管委會主持。</p>
<p>協定草案全文</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓六日電〕國務院本日發表日本代管島嶼之託管協定草案，該草案引用聯合國憲章之條文，規定設立一種國際託管制度，藉以管理並督察若干領土，包括現在各國代管制度下之領土。草案中又述及：一九二〇年十二月十七日之國聯議會曾責成日本代管赤道以北之前德屬島嶼，而此等島嶼由於二次大戰之結果，日本已中止運使任何權限，因此聯合國安理會經認爲對於憲章有關條文尚無不合後，決議對此等太平洋島嶼通過如下之託管條件：</p>
<p>（第一條）規定指定這等島嶼爲戰略上重要之區域，置於聯合國託管制度之下，是後協定草案對該區域即稱爲託管領土。（第二條）美國「被指定爲託管領垚之行政管理處。（第三條）美國對於託管領土行政，立法與管轄權力，受協定規定之限制。（第四條）行政管理處須遵守聯合國託管制度之原則。（第五條）行政管理處必須保設託管領土，須遵循聯合國憲章對於國際和平與安全之維持有所貢獻。爲求達到此項目的起見，行政管理處得（甲）在託管領土上建設海陸空軍根據地及築立堡壘，（乙）在領土上驗紮並調動武裝部隊，（丙）利用託管領土上之志願軍，設備及協助，以便不但維持託管領土上當地之防禦及法律與秩序，而且執行行政管理處對安理會所負之義務。（第六條）說明行政管理處如何履行其在聯合國憲章第七十六條（乙）款下所負之　務，其中包括：促進領土上居民向自治之發展，促進居民之經濟進步與自足，促進彼等社會與文化之進步。（第七條）規定對居民如下各項自由之保證：言論，新聞，集會，良心，崇拜，宗教，教育，以及移民與遷移。（第八條）行政管理處司法行政及談判商約與其他協定方面，對其託治領土內聯合國各會國及其人民，應有同等待遇之保證。該條款之第三節謂「對於飛機進出託治地區之航空權問題，本款之規定則不作如是之解釋。此項權利係託治地區洽理當局與飛機所屬國家訂閱協定之問題。」（第十條）允許行政管理當局參加任何區域諮詢委會·區域當局·或技術組織或國家其他自動成立協會，此外并凖其參加規定之國際團體。（第十一條）規定美國應採取步驟，確定託治土地居民之國籍狀態。（第十二條）美國應成立在託治領內實施是項協定之法案。（第十三條）聯合國憲章第八十七·八十八條款適用於託治土地。（第十四條）行政管理處應在託治土地內秉承任何適當國際會議及建議之規定。（第十五條）禁止未經美國同意擅自更動，修改或廢止協定之規定。（第十六條）該協定將於完成憲章規定之遞程，并經安理會及美國政府通過後生效。</p>

<h3>山東難胞　急待救濟　魯同鄉歡迎會席上　谷部長談災况</h3>
<p>山東省難民救濟協會，於昨日下午三時在呂班路山東同鄉會舉行盛大之歡迎會，歡迎社會部長谷正綱，並敦請谷部長報告視察山東災區情形及救濟辦法，同時推動救濟魯災。本市各機關首長皆被邀參加，到孔祥熙，谷正綱，秦德純，張靜愚，宣鐵吾，王冠青，暨同鄉會會員兩百餘人。大會由該會副理事長秦德純主席，秦氏首對谷部長表示歡迎之忱，次對谷氏於八月中視察魯省災情後，予魯省災民切實有效之救濟，表示感謝，同時　請上海各機關首長各界領袖協助發動救濟魯災。繼由谷部長報告視察山東災區情形及救濟方法，略稱：對於目前仍處於水深火熱中之山東難胞，本人當極盡最大之努力，與各位協力設法展開切實之救濟工作。山東救濟善後事宜，原由行總負責辦理。八月中央本人奉令前往山東巡視，曾至青島，濟南，周村，淄川，博山等地，需要救濟者約有三百萬人。據行總魯青分署報告，必需救濟者有一百二十萬人，而彼輩原均爲有資產的或是有生產資本，生產工具的農工和知識青年。現在都流落爲難民，亟需救濟。濟南的學生大都民粗饅頭，鹹蘿葡，白開水。衣衫襤褸，赤足無履，比比皆是。農工們被迫離開和平所在，更爲凄慘。這都是受了抗戰八年敵人的蹂躪和一年來共黨的所作所爲，有以致之。視察後將實際情形報告中央，同時發生了幾點感想：（一）山東難胞受盡苦難，痛苦萬分，本人寄以莫大之同情。（二）山東同胞艱苦卓絕的精神，值得敬佩。（三）山東土地肥沃，出產豐富，過去爲抗戰之基地，未來爲建國之基地。山東各有關機關意見，擬請中央撥賑款二十億元，後經中央核准十億元，同時又決定數端：（一）小本貸款五億元。（二）農貸十億元。（三）工貸在措商中。（四）冬衣五十萬套。（五）麵粉三千至四千噸，麵粉每一難胞約可分得一袋。政府在財政困難中，能撥如許賑款和物品，不能不說是盡了最大的努力。最近中央又要作第二次救濟，綏靖區的急賑由社会部辦理。綏靖區被侵佔三百縣，收復一百二十縣，約有二百萬人急需賑濟。中央準備撥九十億元，另加兩萬噸麵粉，每縣約可分得賑款五千萬元，麵粉八千袋，另有五十萬套衣服，和五十萬斤食　，來統籌分配。此外，農民銀行並舉辦小本貸款。中央對收復區地方行政費亦有補助，定爲每縣每月六十萬元，以減輕人民負担。本人不久將去北方各地視察，宣達中央德意，並慰問難胞。最後谷氏　請各界發動救災運動，互助互濟，發揚中華民族之偉大精神。繼由警備司令宣鐵吾致詞，對於抗戰中魯省將領王耀武，李延年及故張自忠將軍等對國家之貢獻，極爲推崇。對於救濟魯災則表示極願參加推　　動。繼由吴市長代表王冠青致詞，表示願呼籲救災。後由中委孔祥熙致詞，籲請上海人士節省吃肉之資，救濟魯災，俾處於水深火熱中之山東難胞，能吃到一點雜糧。同時請上海山東同鄉首先盡力捐贈，以爲倡導。最後討論救災辦法，首先決定募賑款以五億至十億元　　的。</p>
<h3>花好月圓　復興公園今日起　舉行菊花展覽會</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕「採菊東離下，悠然見南山」。古時陶淵明的菊癖，原是史乘傳爲佳話的。但是二千年來國人之愛菊花的，又豈祇陶淵明一人，所謂「菊殘猶有傲霜枝」，多少人曾爲菊花的清高而嚮住呀！</p>
<p>繼黄園菊展之後，本市工務局園場管理處，從今天起在復興公園，舉辦一大規模的菊花展覽會。陳列園中的菊花，大大小小，形形色色，不下三千餘盆。踏進復興公園大門，一片五顏六色的花朶，頓時會使你眼花撩亂，美不勝收。</p>
<p>從華籠路的大門口進去，首先映入眼簾的，是廣大的青草坪上，書着「菊展」兩個大字。字是直體形的，由雪青色的滿天星小菊花堆砌而成。</p>
<p>青天白日滿地紅</p>
<p>眼光從「菊展」兩字轉向左面，「青天白日滿地紅」的國徽，出現在你的面前，這立體形的國徽，也是用滿天星小菊花組成的。高達十八尺，最高層圓錐形的頂巔，是用白菊花搭成的「白日」分佈在它周圍的是十二個「角」也由小白菊花組成。最底下一層，便是「滿地紅」了，由數十盆紅色菊花分佈而成。再以大幅的青草地作陪襯，好一幅青天白日滿地紅的祖國之徽啊！據說：這皆别出心裁的傑作，都是園藝專家程世撫先生所設計的。</p>
<p>熊貓神采依然　脚踏青草地　口銜紅蘿葡</p>
<p>此外，頗堪玩味的，是陳列在玻璃籠子中的熊貓小組的遺體。她脚踏青草地，口銜紅蘿葡，雪白的皮毛，因爲被冰在零度以下的時間過久了，己出現黄色。雙眼還是那麼的有神，對着每一個參觀的遊客，射出炯炯逼人的光芒，是一臉高傲？抑是滿腔的憤怒啊？</p>
<p>除了各苗圃所精心培植的一千餘盆菊花外，尚有各地方人士自動參加的，如黄園，銜園，南洋種苗公司，祥順公司，郭永平，薛浩南，高連實等計三十餘個單位。各種各樣的菊花，計一千餘盆，單　　　　富詩意的名詞，已令人有美不勝收的感覺了。諸如「貴妃醉酒」，「嫦娥奔月」，「金鈎拱月」，「冰盤托桂」，「金昔竹」，「舊朝在」……</p>
<p>據園場管理處長徐天錫，及園藝專家程世撫說：外人與國人對於菊花喜愛的準繩各異，歐美各國，因喜以菊插瓶及植諸花壇，頗少盆栽，所以僅僅注意牠的花朶，直徑，和色澤，因之他們往往喜歡日本種之滿天星小菊。而國人賞菊，取以姿態婀娜，細瓣飛舞，或取其色澤異常，如醬色，綠色，墨紫色等，都認爲是名貴的。</p>
<p>園場管理處中的負責人，辛勤地工作了三天三夜，終於替這醜恶的世界上，增添了一分美麗。——你說你不愛花卉嗎？對於高格的菊花，也向無特殊的好感情嗎？我勸你還是去菊花展覽會作一番觀光吧！在這醜恶的世界上，發掘出一點美麗的因素來，也未嘗不是百愁中的一絲安慰呀！</p>
<h3>市長視察勞工區　十三區內藥水弄英華里一帶　居民龐雜犯案者視爲逋逃藪</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吴市長昨晨八時偕民政處處長張曉崧，前往十二十三兩區視察，查問户籍統計簡表，遷動簿等甚詳，並殷殷垂詢人口增減情形。至九時半始回市府。</p>
<p>據吴市長語記者稱：渠希望能於最近期間，重行至各區視察，下次可能光赴新成區與黄浦區視察。並將親赴人烟稠密，侷促不堪之處視察，俾能獲悉下層生活之真實情形。</p>
<p>記者於市長離去後，復又探詢兩區概況，兩區均爲勞工區，情形特殊，茲分别誌之於下</p>
<p>十二區獻校籌款　可能達三萬萬元</p>
<p>（一）十二區區長爲侯　人，副區長呂型城，設辦事處於戈登路警察分局及新閘路中華新邨十二號周逆邦俊舊宅，全區五十一保，三萬六千户，二十一萬人，計男性約十二萬人，女性約九萬人。該區對於設立國民敎育班，正積極進行，現己成立四十班，每班八十人。視　　校之舉，亦經推動　款，約可達一萬五千至三萬萬，（大半係由各廠主認獻。）該區目前最大難題爲缺乏固定辦公地點，故於市長視察時，曾有一紙呈文，略稱：本所辦公房暨職員宿舍迄無確定地址，員役奔走，影響工作匪淺，茲查新閘路三元坊四十號漢奸張桂生住宅一幢，己爲蘇浙皖敵偽產業處理局查封，擬請暫行撥惜。</p>
<p>失學兒童　佔十分之六</p>
<p>（二）十三區區長爲鄭梅魁，全區卅四保，八百卅三田，人口一三一七七七五人，計男性七三一三二人，女性五八二七三人，該區並有水上保甲。失學兒童達百分之六十。現正推行國民識字班，獻校壽款己達三萬萬元，待覓得校址，即將計劃設立中心小學。復有一事足資一述：該區藥水弄·英華里一帶，居民龐雜，犯案纍纍者視之爲逋逃藪，故過去有「小梁山」之稱。惟經整頓後，己改舊觀。據稱：兩區居民多係勞工，推行區工作時，雖能取得服　　　合作，然因知識水準低落　　　率不免遲鈍云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕邇來市區內時常發生被竊汽車案，雖經警務當局迭捕竊犯歸案法辦，終未能全部肅清。當熟分局上月二十八日得密報，謂有專竊汽車犯俄人伊文諾夫者，住居白利南路二四二三號，當經趙分局長於翌晨五時許，飭股長王端洪，率股員　大成，幹警朱煥章，張餘堯等，馳往將其拘獲。</p>

<h3>二次標售之各里弄房屋　迄無一人申請登記</h3>
<p>這年頭誰願自尋麻煩？</p>
<p>中央信託局第二次標售之房地產三百卅三幢，自發佈公吿後，即遭被列入標售之威海衛路威海別墅，吳淞路大興里，長治路公和里等全體租戶，刊登廣告，一致反對標售，要求維護合法租戶之繼續租賃權。按照民法第四二五條：「出租人於租賃物交付後，縱將其所有權讓與第三人，其租賃契約對於受讓人仍繼續存在。」但在中央信託局標售敵偽房地產投票須知中第十一項規定：「業已標售之敵偽房屋一律於簽訂預約後二日出淸，并於成交之日，交與得標人接管，如出淸愆期，得標人得以書面申請，取消預約，本局除付還定金外，并另照定金給予月息一分之利息。是則凡被標售之房屋，似不論其租賃契約是否有效，出售後其原有住戶將於二十日內一律被勒遷，則成萬之市民，又將遭受流離失所之痛苦矣。記者爲特再訪中央信託局地產處襄理陳翰靑，叩詢上項房產標售處置情形，據談：二次標售開始登記迄今，來信託局登記者已有十八單位，但申請標購之房屋，大都爲單幢者。在報端刊登廣告反對標售之各里弄房屋，則迄無一人申請登記。陳氏承認投標須知第十一項之規定，過於籠統。該局對勝利前取得合法租賃權，而其租賃期限尙未屆滿者，決仍承認其租賃權，不適用於第十一項規定。惟據陳氏稱：除威海別墅之租戶，大部有合法租賃權者外，被標售之虹口區內各里弄房屋　戶，則大部未有合法之租賃關係。至於此項房屋標售後，如何令原有住戶　　　　空，則由處理局辦理，非中央信託局之職權所能及矣。記者乃再訪處處理局秘書長沈冠　，據稱：處理局標售房屋，決不能與民法抵觸，但未獲得合法租憑關係或租賃期限已滿之住　，於房產售出後，處理局將請本市軍營機關協助，勒今遷讓。如威海別墅等整條里弄，須將未取得租賃權之房屋出淸數幢，爲承購者居住，其他仍分租與有租賃契約之原住戶，則承購者當亦不致有何異議也。</p>
<h3>常熟兩奸逆　倚仗敵勢魚肉鄉民　李健次歸震昨受審</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕高院昨審訊漢奸嫌疑案多起：（一）李健次，歸震兩人，勝利後被人檢舉，經憲兵第廿三團及常熟縣政府會同查實，行文高院指李曾任偽常縣縣政府聯絡員及敵憲兵隊翻譯，常假借敵勢，下鄉催收軍糧，勒索米麥等物。又於廿七年七月廿六日帶領敵憲至西巷橋以機槍燒殺，城隍廟等被毀，人民死傷甚多，此外又會同敵憲捕捉抗日份子。歸震則在常熟縣偽特工站担任情報員，又任偽常熟縣警察局特高組組員，與李　次夥同行事。昨在庭上，李承認略諳日語，但僅任偽常熟縣政府庶務科聯絡員，祇間接代敵購辦食物，其他一概否認。歸則供稱：實係同名之誤，而非被告，但對任警局特高組組員，則謂確有其事，然而係奉忠救軍之命參加，掩護供給情報云。</p>
<p>張阿五　陳林根</p>
<p>（二）張阿五，陳林根兩人以駁船爲業，敵偽時期曾在黃浦江面替敵海軍主辦之協興洋行及東和洋行駁運物資，卅二年八月十日上午，有鄉民葛興民張志良由浦東購得食米數十斤渡浦至上海公平路銷售。甫至江心，突遇敵軍小火輸喝令停駛，張阿五陳林根強將葛張等拉至輸上，誣以竊盜軍用品之罪，押送敵憲兵隊施以非刑，覊押廿九日始訊明釋放。勝利後乃由被害人告發，兩被告昨在庭上否認。</p>
<p>吳文荃</p>
<p>（三）吳文荃，被控於民國卅年間曾服務於偽特工總部七十六號，後復任敵上海憲兵隊蓬萊路分遣隊密探，時倚勢向商民敵詐，勝利後乃由人檢舉。以上各案’詢問一過後，均改期再訊。</p>
<p>白俄</p>
<p>勿爾滔勒荷夫，留滬已有十十一年之久，現年四十四歲，曾任本市白俄倫民聯誼會秘書，勝利後被控曾任靜安寺路敵軍部無綫電台情報員。該案前數度開庭調查，被告均否認。昨日上午審理，辯論終結，定本月十四日上午九時半宣判。另被控代敵築路之小工孫仁茂案，亦定是日宣判。</p>

<h3>江面警察多　權限分不清　苦了商人　莫知適從</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據進出口業中人談：本市碼頭偷竊之風，自當局一再整頓後，情形已稍見好轉。惟江面警力，仍嫌單薄。現聞各方面正發起組織義務水警隊，以襄警力之不足。該項組織，最短期內，當可實現。</p>
<p>又據談：目前港口警察及水上警察在江面上權限之劃分，頗成問題。該案維迭經本市港務整理會商討，迄未獲得解決。商人方面，更莫知適從。甚望有關當局，注意及之。</p>
<p>最近港口輪船擁塞之情形，已無以前之嚴重。此緣美國海員罷工問題迄未解決，故美國到船極少。各碼頭地位遂亦較爲鬆動。</p>

<h3>紡管會議決　多退少補辦法　現紗照限價期貨須貼息　門售批發利潤不得超過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡織事業管理委員會於昨日下午五時，假市政府市長會客室，舉行第十次例會。到吳主委，李副主委，委員東雲章，王仰先，楊錫仁，王啓宇，郭　活，唐星海，及該會業務處長劉文騰等。由吳卞委任主席，會議共歷兩小時。當決　　案二起：</p>
<p>（一）根據第九次紡管會例會決定之四項辦法，第六區棉紡公會理事長王啓宇，曾與紗商業公　理事長唐志良，議有協定多則，昨日提出會中討討論，經修改後，通過全文六條如次；</p>
<p>（甲）迄昨日（七日）止，以前成交之棉紗，不論價格高低，共已提淸者，即作爲了結。（乙）客戶所存棉紗，尙未提取，其價格超過一百七十五萬元者，應雙方洽商解決。其價格不及一百七十五萬元者，限客戶於三日內出淸。（丙）上條超過一百七十五萬元價格之治商辦法，廠方應以補情法補貼之。其受貼補之對象，爲棧單之持有人。（丁）上項棧單持有人，持棧單向廠方洽商解決後，應於原棧單上批註核正日期。（戊）各廠應將棧　持有人姓名，住址，詳細査明。（己）所有棧單持有人售貨，如按門市，只能照廿支紗一百七十五萬元之議價，加利潤百分之十。如係批發或運銷外埠，只能加利潤百分之五。達者嚴辦。</p>
<p>（二）廠方售紗，依現貨廿支紗一百七十五萬元爲原則。如係期貨，應依照拆息一角五分，按日計算，由廠方負擔。</p>
<p>上項決議案，紡管會將於今日指令第六區棉紡公會　飭所屬會員導辦。同時，將召紗商業公會理事長唐志良到會面諭，對棉紗之門市利潤，不得超過議價百分之十，批發利潤，不得超過百分之五。</p>
<p>又悉：吳主委將於今日再度晋謁宋院長，請關於開放美棉結匯問題。</p>
<h3>央行逢高力售　金價被逼回頭　共拋出四千餘</h3>
<p>烚赤昨央行與投機帮奮鬥不已，先昻繼回，晨開二四六萬，銀樓帮以及證劵帮買意不怠，開後即昻達二四八萬以上，央行逢高力售，賣意極殷，不久回風頓起，並因時近配給，買方暫抱觀望，一轉瞬間驟跌至二三八萬五以下，始有維持，回出二四〇萬外，央行即以二四〇萬二五之價，配給一一五條，實銷甚殷，擁資者以及證劵投機商咸來問鼎，近午又回好至二四六萬，午刻在二四五萬五光景掙扎，午後隔日交割初堅後疲，央行力拋不已，全日統計不下四千餘條，最後終被壓倒至二四一萬，較前收回跌四萬五，飾金念五萬六，紋銀升爲三千四，銀元微降，暗拆平平，息價仍在一角半左右。</p>
<p>外幣缺乏投機氣氛，美鈔並無向榮之力，暗市低價四一〇〇元，高價未越四一八〇元，午刻在四一五〇元以下較前收相彷彿，港票亦黯然無光，結果回小五元，港電匯八七〇元左右，印匯一〇五五元，英匯一四一〇〇元，仍屬供過於求，成交甚少，美匯掛牌未更，對做却無。</p>
<h3>公債平疲　統了又要抽籤了</h3>
<p>公債昨尙平穩，統丙晨開一二七〇元，福源等有售，曾退至一一三〇元，而後稍有買戶，來加維持，中途回升至一二八〇元，量後在一二五〇元左右掙扎，結果與前收相彷彿，甲種跌七〇元，乙種六一四號有納，反升三〇元，統丁跌一〇〇元，統戊降一九〇元，成交約五百萬元。</p>
<p>又訊，財政部定於十一日舉行下列四種債票抽籤還本，即民國廿五年統一公債丁種債票，廿八年軍需公債第一期債票，卅年軍需公債第二期債票，曁民國卅二午同盟勝利公債。</p>
<h3>紡建布漲千元　紗價小一二萬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗市欲漲無力，特雙馬晨初一度喊高至二百三十萬，然乏買戶，迄無成交，其徐廿支紗，因紡管會決定，於本月十一日起，不准再有黑市後，同業咸停止買進，靜觀動向，人心轉軟，吐售者頗不寂寞，接受者寥寥，中小型廿支紗，的跌一二萬元，廿支筒紗，略有成交，其價格照配價加利潤云。</p>
<p>布望昨日一致向榮，客銷亦較前活動，紡建開價，各檔亦提高一千元左右，前往申請開配者甚衆，昨市龍頭細布做八萬一千七百五十元，藍鷄七萬九千元，陽鶴七萬五千元，四君子嗶嘰老貨九萬四千元，四君子印白九萬一千元，棧單貨則做八萬九千元。</p>
<h3>布價審議會　保留成本計算</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕棉布審議會，於日昨下午三時在社會局會議室舉行第三次例會，出席者社會局顧處長，市商會諸尙一，紡建公司吳叔方陳家振，六區棉紡業公會吳漱英，嚴光第，機器染織業公會陸潤金，棉布業公會　久峯貝在榮等，首由願處長報吿上次會議紀錄，次即討論布疋成本，即以染織業所造送之各太路貨成本計算表爲資料，逐一硏討，分別修正，惟目下布市已下降至實際成本以內，故決定成本計算數，暫由社會局保留，决由六區棉紡業公會吳漱英說明，現市布價確已不敷成本，欲求平衡唯冀當局對於配花，迅採有效措施，庶原料成本减低，紗價亦可因而再小，紗價能再小，布價不特足敷成本，亦可繼續平抑，否則布廠業前送十分危殆，最後顧處長云，今後凡有超過限價之非法黑市，應恪遵政府所定辦法，由司法機關嚴予懲處，務期澈底消滅。</p>
<h3>絲綢實銷清淡</h3>
<p>昨日人造絲又微見抬升，因有實銷，廠商向黑市塲採辦，於是人心又引起俏利之慾念。一二〇號老裝天橋有光貨無一箱成交，只有新裝貨有二三箱交易，上午做三百十七萬至二十萬元，下午做二十萬至三十萬元，比上日略見鋒俏，做大四五萬元。一二〇號半先昨日亦喊大五萬元之讀。廠經去胃呆滯，市價平穩無變化，交易極度淸淡。綢貨亦在疲途中盤旋，實因天氣過暖，門市店中生意冷落，本埠銷塲有限，答帮採辦亦稀，有以致之。</p>
<h3>生仁黃豆雖跌　油價仍未回平</h3>
<p>米市南北兩市塲共到各貨一萬餘石，消化仍呆，中下北粳及南粳均續疲千元，羊秈埠秈略見軟化，杜秈客秈下降三五百元，險元高定决削，白元去化仍懈，麵粉到消兩稀，暫無呼吸，小麥胃呆，續小三五百元，　豆來源雖稀，奈去化不爽，下挫千元，芝蔴略升千元，生仁靑島來貨獨湧，南洋不解，本市銷路看望，再入疲境，高貨下跌二三千元，中關猛落四五千元，黃豆東北到源益增，供過於求，逐步下落，前途不易樂觀，油市生油豆油貨缺，未見正式市價，僅淸油做開，價格上漲三四千元，蔴油亦上升不已。</p>
<h3>中植配售食油　限三日內繳款</h3>
<p>中國植物油料廠配售食油，每日爲兩百桶，七日改配凈生油兩百桶，每担　九萬九千元，據悉中植每日配售之食油，油商常有不往提貨者，外間即誤以其未能配足，實則該廠每日均按各油商所請數目照配，該廠鑒於此種情形，決改變配售辦法，配售食油，三日內如不繳款提貨者，即取銷其配油資格，另配申請合格之零售店。</p>
<h3>穏定美鈔黑市　在憑滙單提貨</h3>
<p>據出口業人士談：目前出口物品，例須向中央銀行或大通銀行等申請發給證書，證明該項物資之外匯數額，已由銀行代收或由該行入賬，海關方可憑銀行之證書，而准其輸出，辦法已可稱縝密，惟進口物品則不然，故每遇外輸抵埠，美鈔即被搜購，黑市遂漲，若進口貨物到埠，海關亦須憑原結匯之銀行結匯單據，再准其提貨，則美鈔黑市之激盪，必將緩和不少。</p>
<h3>日茶出口</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京六日電〕盟軍最高統帥部今日命令日太政府採辦機關，於所存茶葉內，提出一百萬磅，交與日本茶葉出口公司，以供出口之需。</p>
<h3>銀錢業減低日拆　欠息減爲每月一角半</h3>
<p>財部對於利息抑低極具決心，曾電令中央銀行於核定讓行利率之時，儘量抑低，以蘇民困，全國與論亦以工商衰落利息之高亦其一因，茲悉本市錢業公會將於今日起，將欠息掛牌日拆减低五角，即每千元每日由五元五角减至五元，計算月息即爲一角五分，至同業間拆息每千每天三元三角，存款日拆仍爲每千六角，銀行拆息按慣例由錢業議定，由銀錢兩公會會同呈報中央銀行核准，故銀錢兩業將於今日起减低日拆。</p>
<h3>食糖交易稀少</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢較弱，續見下游，公會劃盤現貨廿號中砂白十三萬二千元，生砂十一萬二千元，二四粗白十七萬七千元，百磅秘魯白砂十六萬元，台灣公司續有開出，計二四粗白十七萬元。四半車白十八萬元，三半車白十五萬元，廿號中砂白十三萬元，生砂赤十一萬元，但行方申購者空前淸寂，統共未滿萬包，號貨開出台灣普通片冰十四萬五千元，興化白十二萬二千元，興赤十一萬四千元至十萬〇八千元，刁靑十一萬二千五百元至一千元，統共成交二百數十件。</p>
<h3>所利得稅　昨開二次審議會　繳稅書已發者百餘公會　逾期未報者將加成課征</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市直接稅局，昨因催收去年度所利得稅，假金門飯店召開審査會議，王撫洲署長，特自京趕到，審査委員曁商會代表出席者，杜月笙，徐寄廎，査良鑑，王曉籟（葛福田代）奚玉書，潘士浩等，稅局方面隨同王署長出席者爲樓主任，葛帮辦，王科長等。關於前次商會所移去之全部報表，局方提出統計，謂照原報盈餘額百分之一百五十課稅，當得稅額一百九十二億餘，離原預算仍違。並稱有百餘公會之報表，已核發繳稅通知書，槪不査賬。未發部份，正在絡續核發，短期即可竣事。王署長並指明照盈餘百分五十課稅，係遵照部頒所利得稅簡化稽征辦法辦理，希商會轉吿各業公會，勿得誤會。商會續收之申報表，截至本月五日止，共收一千餘戶，盈餘三萬六于餘萬元，由商會代表即席提交稅局。並決議照各該業平均標準資本純益率課稅，不再査賬。但其最低限度，不得少於盈餘之百分一百五十。其逾期未報者，槪不展期，即由稅局分別逕行決定。其征課標準，較已申報者爲嚴。對於已知其業別者，決定依照各該業之平均標準資本純益率，再加百分二十課稅。業別不明者，決定比照其類似之業，或依全市平均標準資本純益率，酌加若干成征課之。會由各代表對於納稅單位之迄未完全申報，表示遺憾。聞四大百貨公司亦未申報云。會後其某君語人，所利得稅之簡化稽征，其稅額原不限於盈餘額以內。但希望稅局仍勿採取苛擾行爲，以卹商難。</p>
<h3>證交營業細則　條文修正兩條</h3>
<p>證劵交易所暫行營業細則第六十六條及第六十七條文，最近呈奉財經兩部核准修正，其修正全文如下：</p>
<p>第六十六條，經紀人應繳納保證金於本所轉存中央銀行，本所認爲必要時，得令其繳納交易證據金，由本所彙存中央鎭行。</p>
<p>第六十七條，經紀人保證金，照第四條分債券股票兩種，每種定爲五千萬元，其百分之四十須繳納現金，其餘百分之六十，得以有價證劵或房地產充之，但房地產不得超過百分之三十，有價證劵或房地產之代用價格，由本所擬定，呈奉核定公吿之，前項有價證劵或房地產，跌價滿二成時，經紀人接得本所通知後，每次應如限向本所補繳代用品，轉存中央銀行，其漲回原價時，由本所分別通知發還之。</p>
<h3>今年棉產　約七百九十萬擔　每畝平均祇二十四斤</h3>
<p>農林部棉產改進諮詢委員會，及中華民國機器棉紡織工業同業公會聯合會，賡續前華商紗廠聯合會中華棉業統計會，歷年舉辦棉產調査報吿成例，經分別派員至產棉省區實地調查三十五年度棉產情形，根據調査員報吿，發表第一次估計，此次估計，係根據河北山東山西河南陝西江蘇安微江西浙江湖北湖南四川等十二產棉省份之調査報吿編成，惟山東省情形特殊，本會所派調査員由靑島折回，所列數字，係由華北棉產改進處電請山東省建設廳胡平初先生所提供，山西一省，除由本會派員調查外，並由華中棉產改進處轉請山西省建設廳辦理，又湖南全省十二產棉縣份，截至十一月五日爲止，僅收報吿四縣，迭電催促，調査員尙無回電，故所列數字，僅屬一部份，容俟第二次發表時，再行修正。</p>
<p>本年調査，因籌備較遲，各地交通又多阻隔，估計報吿，槪以十月二十五日以前棉情爲準，度量衡均爲市用制。</p>
<p>本年棉產，比較去年大有進展，但與二十六年比較，相去仍遠，此或由遍地條火，糧食缺乏，棉農不願植棉，及交通阻隔生產成本高昂，產銷兩方，均未走上康莊大道所致，而雨暘不調，亦一原因，至病蟲爲害，損失尙屬少數，此次佔計共有棉田三千二百四十一萬八千一百六十九畝，的產皮棉七百八十九萬五千六百十祖，平均每畝，可產皮棉二十四斤。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京六日電〕敎部頃核定發給公費辦法三項：（一）靑年軍核准退役復學生，按優待靑年從軍辦法規定，原有公費，一律繼續發給，惟原未核給公費者，亦有同樣要求，茲爲顧念靑年從軍學生學業，凡核准退役，經該部分發之靑年從軍復學生，一律給予全公費，（免繳學宿膳費，其他費用，不在此限），非經該部分發者，不在此限。（二）共區逃出之忠貞靑年或學生，家陷共區，經濟來源斷絕，確切査明屬實，並取具足資證明之可靠證件，核給公費。（三）臨大補習班，均限七月份一律結束，原有甲乙兩種救濟費，自應一律取消，此項學生，雖經部方分發，與各校所招新生無異，其公費之給予，仍應照規定公費辦法，在規定各款內，分別核給公費。</p>

<h3>敎部發言人　留學政策</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京七日電〕近來若干報紙，多討論留學政策，從寬從嚴，議論紛紛，記者特走訪敎育部探詢，據該部發言人談稱：社會人士關心敎育，誠屬好現象，敎部對留學政策，向極愼重，對社會與論，亦極虛心考慮，大戰八年，歐美學術日進千里，其突飛猛進之情勢，遠非吾人所能想像，急起直追，趕上時代，須從兩方面着手，一面應積極充實我大學設備，謀根本解決，一面亦應選派靑年可造之才，出國學習，以免落後。至於培植大學師資，自亦不能不預爲之計，但如漫無限制，則有錢人之子弟，均可自由出國，必將發生流弊，蓋可斷言。本届自費留學生錄取樣準，自較公費者稍寬，但較上届自費生考試則較嚴，以人數論上届報考者僅八百人，而本屆則達三千八百十七人，已錄取之學生，不過僅獲得出國之資格而已，如無外國大學允許入學文件，則仍不准出國，而外匯數額，亦有限制，決不使超過其實際需要，　生流弊。至於出國後之管理與回國後之就業問題，敎部已有通盤計劃，管理方面，目前由大使館負責，將來擬設文化專員辦理。回國學生，由敎部分別向有關機關推荐，此項辦法，已實施有效，去年返國留歐學生五十餘人，大部由敎部推荐就業，將來社會安定，展開建設，需才更多，學生閒散失業之現象，當可逐漸消滅。總之，本部對留學政策之推行，係就國家民族建設大計着想，社會關心此事，提出意見，本部至爲歡迎，虛心考慮。</p>

<h3>踏入管仲的故鄉</h3>
<p>— 眉公</p>
<p>十月廿七日潁上訊</p>
<p>這一個中國古代大政治家——管仲的故鄉的潁上，給乍來此地的人們的第一個印象，是：古老·僻塞·殘破·乾燥·</p>
<p>從正陽關湖沙河六十里，至新河口登岸，西行立餘，便到了潁上縣城，進東城門，首先碰到眼瞼的，就是路北一座高　半空的魁星閣。閣上四個大字「天下文明」.閣上窗子敝開，有幾位十八九歲的女學生在閣中工作——不是做女紅，就是在看書，閣下是弧形的門洞，穿過門洞朝北不遠路東，就是潁上全縣第一大旅社——社會服務處。房間還不錯，惟招元，吃喝之類，倒不甚貴。</p>
<p>城頭廁所</p>
<p>潁上城，圓形，小得很，周圍不過一厘多路。片刻之間就可繞城一周。城牆用磚砌成，高不過丈，這是因在抗戰期內從上端拆除了一部份。我從東門登城，循城頂而至北門，望城外秋老荒郊，城內小塘楊柳，風景不惡。惟自北門而西門而南門再重門，這一帶，幾乎做了「城頭廁所」，三步一尿，五步一屎，臭風徐來，令人作嘔。有些成年大人，都祛下褲子蹲著　屎，小孩子，狗更不在話下了。</p>
<p>一個陌生的人，乍到潁上，最感覺彆扭的，就是潁上的街道；東西南北四條大街，純以大石條鋪成，那些石頭經過很長年代的折磨和踐踏，已是崎嶇不平了。走在上面，很覺吃力。</p>
<p>管子墓前</p>
<p>從所謂「潁上公園」朝北走，繞過水塘，便到了管仲墓，真是聞名不如見面，見面更不如聞名，管仲墓不過如是而已。</p>
<p>一座隆起的土阜，有丈八高，方圓可十餘丈，上面滿栽着青松，很繁茂。有古石碑一，碑的下端沒入土中，作向前傾斜狀，　有「管仲父墓」四大字。又有新近立的石碑一座，當中一行大字是「嗚呼大政治家管子之墓」，旁有幾行小字是「管仲茲夷吾，潁上人也，孔子曰：管仲相桓公，霸諸侯，一匡天下……」一直到「微管仲，吾其披髪左　矣。」止一段文字。字體是寫的魏碑，按時代蔣則是民國碑。</p>
<p>從管鮑祠往東走不遠，便是潁上救濟院。房舍全是新蓋的，約三十間，分安老所，育幼所，育嬰所，施診所等幾部份，每所有所長，專司其事。博愛堂作了兒童的教堂，好得很。施診所設在城內北大街，就醫討藥者頗形擁擠，十分之九是患隱疾，其次是　　。</p>
<p>如此敎育</p>
<p>恰好在魁星的東鄰，就是潁上縣民眾敎育館，館長崔一望而知是位忠厚持重的好人。圖書閱覽室裏，一冊書也沒有，有幾張報紙，還都是半月以前的舊報，桌凳殘破不完，牆壁和屋子頂都破爛不堪，太不成樣子了。崔館長說，每月業務費只兩千元，還不夠訂半月中央日報的（中央日報半月需二千二百五十元，）潁上民眾教育館，連一份報都訂不起，則其他像球類，棋類等設備，自然更談不到了。</p>
<p>潁上係四等縣，縣城人口全數只萬餘人，但中等學校却有三所，爲數不可謂少，縣立中學，一般人認爲最好，校長江效孔，是位架着近視眼鏡的小胖子，對敎育很熱心，縣立簡師校長姜鳴球，五十多歲，頭髮頒白，談笑生風，是多年的老教育家，私立夷吾中學，校長　子健，爲人忠厚，三個學校都是男女兼收，人數很多，但學生成績實在太差，依我看，這是因本縣小學敎育不良而產生的必然結果，有一個小學六年級的學生間教師什麽是三民主義，教師答道：「三民主義就是士農工三種人想主意。」如此不問可知。</p>
<p>除城廂三中等學校外，在鄉間還有農職一所，私立成德中學一所，因未觀光，故不　。</p>
<p>出南門數十步，便可看見夷吾中學的校門，夷吾是管仲的字，這一定是爲紀念管子而設立的學校吧。這校門向正東，正對着苗圃，苗圃是穎上農業推廣所的所在地，面積並不大，地理上的天然環境倒很好，只可惜太欠人工的管理與設計，更看不到農業「推廣」的迹象。　　小型報紙</p>
<p>宣傳文比，報導新聞的報紙，在穎上更顯得可憐。城內共兩種小型石印單面的報紙。一種是「新穎報」，爲皖幹團穎土聯絡站發行的，五天出一張。內容平常，另一種是「穎上日報」，名曰日報，實際是兩天一刊，內容略佳，惟篇幅太小，材料太不豐富，一張報看不到一刻鐘，就可一字不漏的全部看完，其「小」可知。穎上日報訂價甚低，每月四百元。惟一個生人到穎上去，是無法看到穎上日報的。街頭巷尾的閱報欄裏沒有，各戶商家住戶也沒有，城鄉各保谷甲也沒有，究竟穎上日報都推銷到哪裏去了呢？這確是一個有趣的而又可悲的間題。</p>
<p>災民可憐</p>
<p>就目前說，潁上最重大的問題，無過於「救濟災民」了。災民，在潁上是普遍的，因沙河和黃河走一條路，八年抗戰，潁上挨了八年水淹，勝利後的今年，又挨了一次空前絕後的大水災；從縣城東北方不遠的三岔口河到謝橋集，過去是平坦大路，現在則一　四十餘立，小舟行在水面上，仿佛漂在大湖中。那數不清的村莊，一座座　在水裏！有的連屋子的影子也看不到，只剩下一聲樹梢，探出水面。舉目四望，天連水，水通天，一片汪洋，無邊無岸！災民個個都是面黃肌瘦，因時疫流行而病死的不再少數。據可靠數字之統計，計潁上陸沈田地一百三十七萬畝，佔全縣總地畝數的二分之一強；災民計兩萬七千〇六十戶，大人七萬七千六百〇二人，小孩六萬〇二百人，合計十三萬七千人餘。這些災民，缺衣少食，看看北風凜冽的隆冬將屆，他們怎麼活命啊？</p>
<h3>從一滴水看西安</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者李馳</p>
<p>二日西安航訊</p>
<p>彷彿是英國詩人威廉·勃雷克（W.Blake）的兩句詩：「從一粒砂看宇宙，從一滴水看世界」。記者愧無如比「法力」，祇想由一滴水來看這個帝王古都—長安。</p>
<p>生長在東海之濱的人，對於水似乎都漠不關心，住在沿海有自來水供給的都市人，好像水（和空氣，陽光同樣重要的生活要素啊！）不過是由水龍頭流出來的東西吧了，誰有閒想啊鉛水管沒有水汲上來時要變成怎樣？</p>
<p>然而，在西北，祇要到了由中原走向大西北第一道門戶——長安，對於水的觀念就截然不同了。記者年前隆冬之際到西安，當天對西北第一個印象就是口裏呷到鹼味極重混澤不清的白開水，喝不下口也得喝。回頭看看屋裏那水井，深約五丈有餘，那位工友搖了大半天，才在井底汲出半桶不像水的水，當時，我就想起南國故里的水井常常水滿到齊平井　之可貴，也想起香港常用半呎口徑的救火水喉來沖涮街廁和水渠那一派「豪華」氣概。</p>
<p>望不見八水繞長安　使人心痛酸</p>
<p>西北黃土多含鹼，水味不免帶苦。西安市西南有所謂「甜水井」，所謂「甜」，實際上不過苦味較輕而已，然而己經足夠寶貴了。</p>
<p>水的味兒到底是件小事，因爲「評茶品茗」的優閒生活方式早已落伍，嚴重的問題，却在於因爲給水缺乏，和汲水費錢太多，直接而且致命地限制着許多種工業無法建立，都市規模和高層建築不能實現，而更廣泛的對於每個市民的威脅，在於缺乏水而帶來更多的疾病，戕害市民的健康。這事實，後頭就有具體的數字作爲明證。</p>
<p>然而，長安在過去也像今天這般缺乏水的供給麼？我想並不因爲人口能密集的第一個條件，就需要因水問題首先解決。梆子戲「二度梅」演着陳杏元和番故事，陳到了塞外想起故鄉長安，在望鄉重台上唱道：「望不見八水繞長安，使人心痛酸！……」這八條水流正可代表當年長安的繁華，水利的發達。</p>
<p>據顧教授的考據：這八條水的名字，那是長安城北的涇水和渭水，城南的　水和　水，城東的　水和流水，城西的灃水和澇水。他又說：﹁如果咬文嚼字的話，玩味「八水饒長安」的「繞」字，真把長安附近的景色形容得逼真極了！」</p>
<p>但是，道句戲文只好讓陳杏元在那時唱，因爲在今天，西安僅傍在涇水和渭水，其餘六條水，淤的淤，乾的乾，甚至有些連河道河床的遺跡也無影無踪，更談不到「繞」字了！</p>
<p>皮膚病「榮獲冠軍」沙眼居第二</p>
<p>讓我們先從西安的降雨量來看看：長安在最近十八年來的平均雨量每年僅有五百公厘，約及江浙一帶最少的七百公厘的十分之七，和最多的一千五百公厘的三分之一。西安較諸本省陝南漢中一帶之有七百六十公厘雨量，亦不及其三分之二；然而比起陝北之僅有三百五十公厘的雨量，則又多了十分之四了。由上面的數字看，可知陝西之南·中·北三部的雨量的差額是如何劇烈。然而造林學告訴我們，造林可以改變氣候，好些例子證明在造林計劃完成後，當地雨量可以增加二分之一，事在人爲，人定勝天，又，據說民國十七，八年西安發生大旱，當年雨量僅有二百·三百公厘，是時全城內外草木，完全枯焦，所以我們今天在市內看到的樹木，百分之九十九都是民十九年以後栽培而成。像這樣慘痛的經騐，人們爲什麼志記得那末快？</p>
<p>請看西安市內有十五年歷史和每年門診患者達十萬人的省立醫院的記錄吧：根據該院（去年七至十二月）科別病別的精密統計，屬眼科患者最多的是各種砂眼；皮膚花柳科的首三位是各種濕疹，膿痂疹，和　瘡；而內科則肺病以十分之一的比率佔了首位</p>
<p>再放大範圍來看看陝西全省的疾病統計。據陝省衛生處最近發表的數字：皮膚病「榮獲冠軍」，砂眼僅居第二。他們並且添附了如下的說明：在陝北丘陵地區和陝南山岳地區，因用水缺乏，皮膚病與砂眼的「跳梁跋扈」，較於關中涇渭河盆地尤甚。</p>
<p>試想想吧：住在窰洞裏除了吃下肚子去的水以外，從不敢妄想到有其他消耗用水的人們，不是最夠資格患染疹，疥·砂眼麼？西北幸而有充分的陽光，它無形中撲滅了好些細菌，而肺病的傳染與感受，亦因此不妨認定經由食道胃腸的多於經由鼻腔氣管的。記者看過供給五十人伙食的廚伏，爲了節省一盆水，而寗願耐心地在飯後把五十雙筷子用一塊布來逐一揩擦「乾洗」。我看夠了，中上等館子的堂倌與客人吃完了就將筷子在圍巾上一揩，放回筷子筒裏，等候第二個客人來使用。我也看夠了，一個豆漿販十和一個湯麵担子從開市到賣完，從不使用半點水來洗滌匙。碗。食器。……數不清的例子，證明了水的缺乏如何可怕，增加了傳染疾病的機會。雖說有了水不一定就把上述數種最流行的病症完全消滅，但是，無疑的，假如每個人都有充分的用水與食水和沸水，最低限度，必可大大的減少生病的機會。</p>
<p>比金剛鑽更亮的水　是當前急務</p>
<p>「一磅的洽療不及一兩的預防」，然而有効的預防常常要擴大到社會環境衛生，和社會治療政策。在西北，就在它的第一道門戶——西安吧，已經看出水和環境衛生的關係。</p>
<p>中國的百年乃至千年大計，並不局限於東南沿海，高瞻遠囑一點去設計，必要注射到西北角的開發。復員了，許久不聽到建設大西北這句口號了，但我相信西北必有一天再被人重視，而抱着宏圖大略到西北來的，就首先要顧及對於水，對於疾病的搏鬥。歐洲人美洲人開發南洋菲律賓而樹立了熱帶病學，日本人侵略中國也樹立了「大陸病學」，這都是很好的例子。大規模的開發西北，必要從移民的保健着手，其次，對於當地原有居民的保健，亦應同樣注意。據新疆青海一帶歸來的醫師說，漢人帶去許多疾病，在漢人中間本來並不嚴重，但在士人中因爲一向沒有這種病，自然的抵抗力缺乏，所以病情倒意外的嚴重。然而不管怎樣說，在醫與藥之前，更急需的依然是水，比金剛鑚更亮的水！</p>

<h3>論打針與處方（下）</h3>
<p>— 錢德</p>
<p>（四）治療要注重一般原則</p>
<p>疾病發作之後必須從早診治，但治療並不限於用藥物，注意一般原則，維持並增加體力以利與疾病戰鬥，比服藥打針還重要十倍。即使是傷風咳嗽小病，如果不能注意這原則，可能加劇轉成肺炎，到那時再睡倒，幸而能恢復，精神時間經濟已受到數倍的損失了。下面數項原則看似老生常談，平淡無奇，但如能在診斷，治療及恢復期中切實注意遵守，一定大有利於病情的進展。</p>
<p>1給病人以足够的肉體與精神的休息，使其體氣充沛，以與病魔搏鬥。</p>
<p>2給病人以足够的熱量，適當的蛋白質，炭水化物，脂肪，鹽類及維生素以增其抵抗力與修補力。祇要他胃腸能消化呼吸，平衡的食物足可供給他日常所需的無缺。患有胃腸病，糖尿症及腎病等情形下，食物調節更關重要，應由醫師酌定後遵行。</p>
<p>3保持大小便及皮膚機能之暢通，以利排除廢物與毒素，大槪除了有組織水腫以外，多飲水總是好的。</p>
<p>4採取方法以緩解病人所最感痛苦妨害其安寗而削弱其體力的症狀是必需的，如果需要用藥，以不致隱蔽疾病之本來面目致妨害診斷爲原則。</p>
<p>其目的不外乎（1）在診斷建立之後，用對症藥或特效藥以治病，（2）在診斷未確定而懷疑是某種病症時，給予特種藥物以試其療效藉達間接診斷之目的。處方應有指徵，決非應酬品，不能隨便發放；用藥一經開始，應當澈底執行，以竟全功。然而沒有一種藥萬全而無流弊，同樣的，兩人同病，其症狀各異，兩人對同一藥品之反應也不同，即使同一病人對於藥物之反應也隨情形而不同。所以治療必需有原則而不能固定方式，旣無某藥治某病必效之說，更無可以常服而萬靈之藥。譬如土根素對阿米巴痢有效，逾量也能致腹瀉；鹼性粉對消化性潰瘍有效，但並不對他種「胃病」同樣有效，如何認淸指徵，熟知藥性，選擇時機，斟酌增减，並使病人知其利害而收最高療效，責在醫生。</p>
<p>所謂澈底的治療，非僅病狀消失，還要根治而不能再發。原來諸種疾病，除非很快進行到死亡，大槪在過程中都有緩解現象，不經治療，亦可暫時减輕，至再發時則更甚。譬如梅毒經注射一二次九一四後，局部體症可以消失，肺結核咯血可以服些毫不相關的藥而停止，這當然不能表示梅毒與結核已經根治，類此之例甚多。如何才能算根治，醫生心裏自明白，但因病人對此已經滿意，登報鳴謝，也就樂享其成，這實在是悲喜劇。</p>
<p>現在有一種很普一遍而極危險的現象，那就是磺醯胺類藥物之被普遍濫用，藥商可用以製成藥片，針藥。牙膏等等，病家也認爲這是統治百病的家用良藥，旣名之爲「消炎片」就不論傷風，咳嗽，牙痛，發熱，祇要他認爲這是「炎」，就可以無醫自通，隨便零碎服用。我們常誹議中醫之一張處方開藥數十味爲複雜處方（Gun　Shat　prescuiption），此種以一藥統治百病的情形，可稱爲掃射療法。畢竟有多少病因此治癒是很成問題的，因爲本藥之療效祇在有規則的大量服用數日後才能發揮；但一定有若干病人爲此不規則服用而發生中毒或藥物抵抗，在必須服用時再不發生效果，這無異以利刃作玩具，是很足惋惜的。同樣，盤尼西林是此次大戰時醫藥界的偉大發明，靠他不知救了多少生命。可是在出產國還不能無限制供應的今日，在我國却成了病家崇拜的神品，同行發財的工具，濫用到不可置信的程度！作者知道曾有人用以治腹漲，並隔日注射以治胃癌，富雷鳴（A．Fleming）博士有知，定有啼笑皆非之感。</p>
<p>凡上所舉，均有背乎治療之原則，病人對此是無知的，如何糾正這種風尙，也是醫師之責。</p>
<p>（六）打針是否必要？</p>
<p>旣然決定需要用藥了，總不外乎由口服，注射，吸入，灌肛及塗擦諸途一徑輸入。因爲嘴的最大用途就是吃，最簡便，最自然，而最常用的給藥途徑應當是口服。可是藥商與醫生因爲針費及手術費關係，精誠合作，藥商製造出些補血，淸血，强心等針，各目繁多，根本不需用藥品的要打針，明明可以用口服的更要打針；醫生受人利用又去曚敝病人，有機會就勸打針；病人對此原是茫然，但旣然人家說得幾針可以根治，而補血强心等名字又聽着舒服，也就不知不覺以此爲時髦速效的療法而去接受。到今天，他們有一種心理，以爲找醫生總得要處方，最好是打針。倘然您吿訴他無需處方，反對打針，還以爲您是個不入時不明醫道的小卒呢！要知道：多少錢從此滾進藥商與醫生的腰包？多少病人爲喜歡打針而局部潰爛，受染而變成膿腫敗血症，因此送了命？</p>
<p>然則「打針」是否必要呢？注射是有他的地位的，但也祇有在下列幾種情形下才用得着，超乎此，便是濫，便帶生意經。需要注射之指徵爲：</p>
<p>1急症之需要迅速藥物作用者，如急性雅片中毒用可拉明，咖啡素等。</p>
<p>2病人昏迷不能口服者，如腦型惡性瘧之需要奎寗，流行性腦炎之需要消發地亞凈注射是</p>
<p>3嘔吐腹瀉口服不能容納吸收藥物者，如霍亂病之需要注射生理鹽水注射是</p>
<p>4藥物口服經胃液作用即分解而失效者，如腎上腺素，九一四。胰島腺紫，血淸，菌苗是。</p>
<p>或者以爲注射可以避免胃腸刺激，並不可靠因爲任何藥物對靜脈或組織的刺激總比胃腸爲强。或謂注射可以更準確計算出劑量的多少，也似是而非，因爲給藥之主要目的在於發生效力，劑量的稍微多少不是問題。</p>
<p>除了前一節所舉出的因注射技術不良而引起的不辛以外，注射，特別是靜脈注射本身還能引起可怕或致死的反應，而一經注入，再不能如口服之尙可以洗胃排出；再則，屢經穿刺之後，往往引起靜脈炎，可能因此發生栓塞病狀，以後確實需要靜脈注射時，反因其已經閉塞而增加困難</p>
<p>需要打針的指徵有限，而可能引起的意外及不良影響却很大，請問病家，爲什麽一定要多花費比口服藥貴數十倍的針藥費而買些痛苦與意外呢？</p>
<p>（七）對病家進忠告</p>
<p>在問題上另外再對病家作更多的甲說，已是不必，祇就上面所述，提供要點如次：</p>
<p>1認識些顧問式的醫生朋友，常常發生關係，多得些日常攝生防病的知識，接受預防注射及定期健康檢査，如有缺點，從早診治，庶防患於未然。這種醫生朋友熟知您過去情形，有病易於診斷。</p>
<p>2有病要早看醫生，吿訴他起病原由與病狀，却不必自作聰明下診斷。診斷並不一定容易，要給他充份的研究觀察時間。</p>
<p>3勿亂投醫，勿常換醫生，診務最忙的醫生未必是最高明的醫生。</p>
<p>4勿亂投藥，服藥應在診斷確定之後才開始。勿希望每次診病要帶藥回家。不處方面從實吿訴您如何調理的醫生大都比亂處方的醫生眞誠可靠些，節省下並非必需買的　錢，對於病中的您可作調整飲食等用，益處較多。</p>
<p>5無論何種疾病，注意其營養，休息與身心之舒適至少與處　　　同樣重要。放棄則允過之</p>
<p>6用藥必要有明確的指徵。要希望得良好的療效，必須爭取時間，奉行醫囑，貫澈到底。不規則不澈底或無目的的治療，可能產生比不治還惡的結果。</p>
<p>7最安全而方便的攝藥途徑是口服，祇有在極少幾稱情形下才需要打針。打針有種種反應及危害，所費數倍於口服而效力有限，毫無廣泛提倡之理由。倘然有醫生勸您打補血針，淸血針，這是他的生意經，可以謝謝他的好意，置之不理。</p>
<p>8沒有一種藥沒有副作用或流弊，所以藥都不可以濫用；病情在隨時改變，需要因而不同，所以也沒有一種可以不經醫生修正而常服的處方。</p>
<p>9醫生對病情總比您認識得透澈，對您所採的決定總有他的立塲，對他有完全的信任就是對您精神上服了一些良藥。同樣重要而必需注意的是醫生在診治上之成功亦全賴於您的合作。</p>
<h3>一九四六年的神藥</h3>
<p>— 張明</p>
<p>兩個月以前本刋編輯部收到伊文先生的一篇譯稿「一九四六年的神藥」，譯文還好，可是因爲原文的內容很不可靠，所以沒有付刊。</p>
<p>該文的原名，＂Gods’Own　Medicine，1948　Mode”，載在本年六月份的Reaners＇Digest　，作者Pautl　de　Cruir。</p>
<p>作者葛魯夫，雖有博士頭銜，並不是醫生，過去以專寫通俗醫學文字出名。可是他的報道往往過大，因此常有不準確的傾向。讀者不察，往往上當。這位先生常在美國銷路很好的刋物如讀者文摘之類上發表這種通俗醫學文字，不顧科學之準確性，以轟動聽聞（Sensational）爲能事，因此美國醫學會雜誌屢次撰文以糾正之。葛氏此文大體與美國拜耳即Winthrop公司對於地美露的宣傳品相同，所以美國醫學會雜誌編輯加以攻聲，說他替藥商做廣吿，傳佈不準確的知識。</p>
<p>所謂「一九四六年的神藥」是指地美露（Demerol，他說「這種藥的止痛功效和嗎啡差不多人而沒有嗎啡那麼容易令人上癮。美國很多醫院已經把這種新藥試騐過，很多病人，以前沒用過麻醉品的，用了這新藥一點不會成了嗜好。</p>
<p>接着他天花亂墜地舉了許多人的報吿，贊揚他的種種療效，種種優點。可是說他缺點的報吿，却隻字不提。雖然他也輕描淡寫地說：「此藥卻也可能使用的人產生一種慾望，要議續應用此藥的慾望。」可是，他接上去說：「這並不是癮，因爲戒除的時候並沒有壞的結果。」</p>
<p>最後，他說，「美國科學界稱他爲「一九四六年型的神藥」，醫生間稱他爲GOM。」</p>
<p>雖然，作者以科學家自居，文章中也像煞有介事地舉出許多科學家的名字。可是，事實上這是一篇神話，如果不是廠家廣吿的話。</p>
<p>事實是如此：「地美露係……鎭痛鎭靜鮮痙藥。其鎭痛作用在嗎啡與可亭之間；但無便秘，縮瞳及呼吸抑制等副作用，且具顯着之鮮痙作用，故對平滑肌痙孿所致之內臟絞痛特別有效，乃其優點。但亦具成癮性，雖不如嗎啡之烈，終屬美中不足。」在一九四五年出版的張昌紹氏實用藥理學中已將他的優點與缺點完全忠實地介紹了。所謂「一九四六年型」的神藥在一九四五年甚至數年以前早經科學家詳加硏究，旣不是一九四六年型，更不是「上帝自已的」神藥。在中國地美露稱度冷丁（Dolantin），已經時髦了三四年，平經拜耳公司突擊宣傳，大多數醫生早已迷信此藥係「上帝自己的」神藥。把地美露與度冷丁的關係拆穿了，葛魯夫先生的這篇文章對於中國人倒並沒有多大刺激性。反正大家是藥廠的宣傳品與說明書敎育出來的，所以異口同聲地說度冷丁不會成癮。因此十針廿針地給病人打下去，病人說此藥眞好，還要打，醫生說反正此藥不會成癮，也就十針廿針地再給他打下去。到後來呢，許多病人自己買了度冷丁自己繼續打下去了。可是許多醫生仍舊相信拜耳的仿單，認爲這不是癮，度冷丁決不會成癮。勝利後，度冷丁更成了戒烟聖藥，黑籍救星。殊不知，雅片癮與嗎啡癮暗中過了戶，換了舶來的度冷丁癮，換湯不換藥。</p>
<p>地美露或度冷丁之像嗎啡一樣地能成癮，早經各國醫界報吿。最近美國麻醉藥品管理處處長安斯林格（Anslinger）在本年九月七日的美國醫學會雜誌上又發表許多得地美露　的病例，裏面有許多是醫生。可憐醫生們，多份是上了藥廠宣傳的當，做了藥商廣吿的犧牲品！</p>
<p>地美露即度冷丁早經美國國會通過歸入麻醉藥類，自一九四四年七月一日起與嗎啡與古卡因等同受聯邦麻醉藥法之制裁與管理。聞吾國麻醉藥品經理處亦正考慮將此藥歸入麻醉藥類而加以管理，以免流弊。</p>
<p>度冷丁確有勝過嗎啡的地方，但也有不如嗎啡的地方，例如他的止痛效力不如嗎啡强大，也沒有嗎啡那樣的可靠。至於成癮性方面，我們對於度冷丁與嗎啡兩藥應該一視同仁，一樣的警惕，切忌長時間的連用。</p>
<p>地美露即度冷丁的眞相如是，美國的非商業化的科學家沒有稱他爲「一九四六年型的神藥」，美國非江湖式的醫生也沒有簡稱他爲GOM。他們認識他是嗎啡的代用品，但是同樣有成癮的危險，應用的時候，他們便記起他在聯邦麻醉藥法管理的範圍之內，小心地應用，以免觸犯國家大法，以免貽害病家。</p>
<p>我們要知道：中國有劣貨假藥，外國也有劣貨假藥；中國有欺人的廣吿，外國也一樣有欺人　　　　　國有不掙氣的科學家與醫生，　市儈　商做不正當的廣吿宣傳，外國也一樣有，一樣有。讓我們打　這個自卑的觀念——</p>
<p>中國貨不行，</p>
<p>外國貨一定比較好；</p>
<p>中國人的文章不可信，</p>
<p>外國的文章一定是可靠；</p>
<p>甚至外國的月亮</p>
<p>也比中國的美姣。</p>
<h3>談談婦科病</h3>
<p>— 唐淑之</p>
<p>吾國婦女，對於婦科病往往諱疾忌醫，待達嚴重階段，始勉强就醫，則又多成不可收拾之病例。作者因就最重要之婦科病作簡單之介紹，俾病者知所警惕，而免失去早日治療之時機。</p>
<p>（一）癌症：癌症以老年與中年人（三十五歲以上）居多。子宮頸癌最爲常見。此症之初期無特殊症狀，亦無疼痛，此因子宮頸本身缺乏痛神經故。待發現症狀，如白帶增多或出血等，則病勢已相當嚴重。正常婦女，僅月經前後或月經中期（產卵期）稍有白帶，倘其他時間發現白帶增多，或已停經婦女，忽然出血或有白帶，須立即就醫。倘待大量出血或有腹痛等症，則早期治療之良機已失。因第一期之子宮頸癌，治療後能生存五年以上者，可佔百分之七十，第二期則降至百分之四十，而第三期則僅百分之十五至二十五；至第四期則雖遇名醫，亦將束手無策。據一般門診病例之統計，患子宮頸癌者，僅有百分之十屬於初期，其餘百分之几十，悉待至子宮頸潰爛，大出血，或者蔓延他部，痛楚不堪，方來就醫。據云：其所以遲遲就醫之理由，係誤於「十女九帶」之說；而出血，因月經月月來潮，又係司空慣見，未能引以爲戒，且初期又無痛苦，故每多忽略。子宮頸癌之嚴重如斯，吾人應竭力作有效之預防爲是。平時有白帶，（多因子宮頸炎所致）宜即就醫，倘因循時日，不但慢性炎不易治療，且子宮頸癌或特接踵而至。按子宮頸癌之直接原因，至今雖尙未盡明，然子宮頸慢性炎，於癌之發生，不無有關也。子宮頸癌雖在經產婦居多，但未婚女子，亦能發生此病，是不可不留意焉。是以無論未婚已婚，倘白帶多，即須從速就醫。而年齡在三十歲以上者，最好每半年或一年作婦科檢査一次，因癌之初期，雖無特症，然此期頗長，（的數月之久）錯過此期，則治療之效果減低。</p>
<p>（二）瘤症：1子宮肌肉瘤：此類瘤症，中年婦女居多，以未婚女子爲最。（有謂不生子女則生瘤），其主要症狀，爲月經不規則，量多，出血期延長，或週期縮短。瘤小時，須經陰道檢査，方能診斷。稍大，小腹上觸之有硬塊，此瘤一經診斷，須及早割除，否則日久非但對於割除手術有困難，且易生其他併發症，如變癌症等等。</p>
<p>2卵巢囊腫（俗稱水瘤）：此瘤以中少年人居多，瘤小時無症狀。稍大由小腹上升。能長至數十磅之重，使腹大如鼓焉。其常見併發症係瘤蒂扭轉，或急性腹痛症，兼有嘔吐等症，須立即割除。其他常見之併發症係與腸等粘連，發炎，或日久變癌症等，總之：瘤症雖屬良性，一經診斷，仍須及早割除，方爲上策。</p>
<p>（三）輸卵管或喇叭管炎：病原大多由淋病菌侵入生殖道所致。早期病狀，白帶多，初稀薄，後成濃質。或者小便痛或腹痛及發熱等症。在急性期，一經發現，須決對休息與用磺胺劑或配尼西林治療。日見成慢性炎。在月經前後每易復發，致輸卵管閉塞，實爲不育之一大原因。按男子傳染此病於婦女後，彼等治愈後尙能有恢復生殖能力之望，而婦女方面，在急性期，如不妥爲治療，其生殖能力，將因而失去。</p>
<p>（四）月經不調：在發育時間，內分泌若失平衡，常有月經不調。故發育時期，務宜營養豐富，同時須注重衛生，惟在中年婦女，則須注意是否有瘤或癌等症，在絕經時期，亦有月經不調。但癌症發出於此時期極多，不可不再三留意焉。</p>
<p>（五）不孕症：不孕原因極多，而最大之主因，不外發育不全，或輸卵管阻塞。凡遇有不孕症，男方亦須受醫家詳細檢查，最重要在檢騐精虫之體質及其活動力等。</p>
<p>廚房中裝置之空氣節器，每分鐘可換入新鮮空氣四百立方英尺。</p>
<h3>人與病菌之戰（九）</h3>
<p>— 摘自「傳染病管理」　喬樹民</p>
<p>二　傳染途徑</p>
<p>傳染病之傳染途徑不一，主要爲直接或間接的接觸傳染，呼吸道傳染，腸胃道傳染及昆虫傳染等數項。抑制之道，在切斷其路綫，得分消毒與有害昆虫及動物之撲滅兩項言之。　（七）消毒——消毒者，殺滅致病的微生物之方法也，實爲切斷傳染途徑之要着。</p>
<p>A關於傳染病患者方面之消毒：</p>
<p>（一）隨時消毒——在疾病過程中，一切排泄，涕吐，汚染物及有汚染可能之物品的隨時消毒，實爲抑制傳染的正本淸源之計。</p>
<p>（二）終結消毒——在傳染病息者痊愈後，死亡後，或遷居後，將至內一切凡有污染可能的物品，予以消毒處置，是爲終結消毒。實際上，如能澈底做到隨時消毒，則終結消毒，殊不必要。</p>
<p>B關於公共用品之消毒，日常用品，如失乳，飲本，食品，食具，牙刷，面巾公共塲所之空氣等之消毒，亦屬重要，尤以傳染病流行期間爲然</p>
<p>B消毒方法——吾人實施消毒，應先瞭解病原體之性質及傳染途徑，消毒的方法雖繁多，但必用之得當，而後有效，未可一味盲目倚賴消毒劑之功能也。</p>
<p>八天然的消毒法——自然界具有消毒力頗强，但日常不便使用，倘能設法利用，則成本最廉。</p>
<p>（一）日晒——日光中之紫外錢，藍紫綫，及熱綫，皆有殺菌力量。其殺菌力之大小，恒與其光綫强度及曝晒之時間成比例。病人用過的書籍等物，不適於採用他法消毒者，可用此法，每處曝晒於强烈之陽光下一二小時，即可。</p>
<p>紫外綫，現經用作空氣消毒、頗爲有效。</p>
<p>（二）乾燥——絕對乾燥，足以毁滅一般病菌。但各類病菌在各種環境下之　乾性不一，　所需殺菌時間不一。</p>
<p>（三）稀釋——腸胃病菌經高度的稀釋作用後，亦可殺滅。</p>
<p>（四）腐化——糞便起腐化作用時，病菌可被殺滅。</p>
<p>B物理的消毒法——光，電，熱，均各可作爲消毒之用。但實用以「熱」爲主，熱有乾熱，濕熱之分：</p>
<p>（一）乾熱</p>
<p>（一）焚化——此爲最良最可靠的消毒方法之一，凡不甚貴重之汚物而可燃燒者，均宜以焚化法處置之。</p>
<p>（二）乾熱氣——乾熱氣之浸透力較弱，熱度需高達攝氏一五〇度以上，經時一小時之久，始可殺滅具有苞芽的病菌。在此高溫之下對於織物織維，並有損蝕之處，故現已不甚通行。僅於皮革書籍等畏水什物及玻璃器皿之消毒時過用之</p>
<p>（二）濕熱</p>
<p>（一）煮沸——此爲簡便易行最爲適用之消毒法。大槪煮沸至五分鐘，一般具有苞芽之病菌，亦可吿殺滅。但結核桿菌及炭疽菌之殺滅，需時稍久。一般飲料食物，均宜用此法消毒之，但對牛乳之毒，爲欲　量保存其中之營養價值，常不用煮沸法，而用巴氏牛乳消毒法（Pasteurization）。即使每一部份之牛乳，均熱至華氏一百四十三度半，而歷時三十分鐘之久，以消滅其中所含之致病菌；或熱至華氏一百六十度，歷時十五分鐘後，迅予冷却之，亦可。</p>
<p>（二）汽蒸——蒸氣熱之浸透性較强，尤以有高壓時爲然。壓度增高時，熱度亦隨之提高。現今一般通行消毒器，均係利用此汽蒸熱爲之。</p>
<p>（九）化學的消毒法——化學的消毒，並不十分可靠，且多危險，祇限於不能採用熱力消毒法時使用之。通用之消毒劑，有下列十餘種：</p>
<p>（一）石灰——此爲最經濟的消毒劑，但需爲未經潮解之塊灰，始有功效。如用以消毒糞便，可取等量的塊灰與糞便和勻之，經二小時後即消毒完成。如作爲普通的消毒劑用，可取塊灰一份，和以淸水兩份，再傾入五倍之水，即成石灰乳液之消毒劑。</p>
<p>（二）漂白粉——此爲　氣與石灰之化合物，應貯於密閉器內，以防氯氣之逸失，一般漂白粉可含氣百分之三十，以一磅之漂白粉和以兩加侖之水，即成便於使用之消毒劑。可作爲消毒糞尿痰涕之用（與等量之消毒劑攪勻而擱置一小時即可）。又飲水消毒亦以使用漂白粉爲便，大抵以水中加有百萬分之一。五左右的氯氣爲有效，視水質淸濁而需要量不一。</p>
<p>（三）高氯氣化汞——此劑之殺菌力頗强，其千分之一的溶液，在半小時內，足以殺滅一般病菌，千分之二的溶液，足以殺滅有苞芽的病菌。但此劑易與蛋白質結合，故不能用以消毒糞痰等物。又此物甚毒，不宜用以消毒食具。</p>
<p>汞化合物，除氯化高汞外，尙有一般診所所常用之汞色素（Mercurochrome），其效力甚低，殊不可靠。</p>
<p>（四）石炭酸</p>
<p>（五）來沙兒</p>
<p>（六）過錳酸鉀——百分之五的溶液，其有殺菌力。但價格較昂，祗宜供小規模的井水，食品，食具，消毒之用。</p>
<p>（七）肥皂——一般肥皂之殺菌力甚爲微弱，但以熱水洗擦而成泡沫薄膜時，亦殊有除菌之功能。</p>
<p>（八）酒精——酒精之　菌力不甚强，以百分之五十至七十的溶液，爲最有效，過濃或過淡均欠佳。</p>
<p>百日咳血清　明</p>
<p>抗百日咳兎血淸（Antipertussis　rabbit　serum），有多種製品，有爲抗毒素性者，有加含抗菌性成分者，後者之效較佳。</p>
<p>去年年底，美國Rocheter大學小兒科之Bradford與　Day兩氏報吿，鏈徽素即斯瑞妥美星（Streptomycin）對於小鼠之百日咳桿菌傳染，甚爲有效。廿頭小鼠得此桿菌傳染後，未加治療，死者九頭，其死亡率幾達50％。反之，於採用鏈徵素治療之廿頭小鼠中，死者僅一頭，即其死亡率爲5％，僅的未用藥組死亡率之十分之一。現該大學正在試騐此華於臨床病例，如能獲得同樣滿意之結果，則百日咳除血淸外，又得一種特效獎矣。</p>
<p>吾人應注意者，靑徽素即配尼西林（Penicillin）對於百日咳毫無療效，但對百日咳病程中，所得之併發性肺炎，或有良效。現有趨勢，採用鏈　　　　　　之Aerosol溶液，氣化後令病人深深吸入，可使肺內之病菌　　肅淸。</p>

<h3>兎</h3>
<p>— 張契渠</p>
<p>我對於小動物，原沒有什麼偏愛。除了那些令人毫無好感的毛毛蟲之外，祗要有機會，我都愿意養。</p>
<p>戰時，我在黃河邊上的陝縣服務。河灘沙地，被國軍挖了許多機槍陣地和交通壕。當初原準備在此地和敵人血戰一場的，誰知敵人始終沒有在此地渡河，終是壕塹生了蔓草，變成狐兎馳騁之地了。</p>
<p>同事中有好圍獵者，常常趁「跑警報」之便，兜捕野兎。但，因爲缺乏良好的工具與深入的決心，所以終究沒有捉到一頭。</p>
<p>一天，忽然有一位同事提了一頭雪白的兎子回來，聲稱是他親自在太陽渡提回來的。於是大家興奮而艷羨地圍了上來，一面欣賞那兎子，一面探問他擒捉的經過，同時，有人主張將牠宰了下酒吃，有人主張留着再捉一頭雌的（這一頭據說是雄的）來給他做配偶，明年生下兎子兎孫，便可以將他販賣，或者剩下皮來，大家都可以得一付翻毛手套。最後，在眾議紛紜中，主任出來作了結論，說：一隻兎子，大家吃既不够，餵起來也麻煩。而且這東西不愛清潔隨地便溺。將來院子裏到處弄成兎子尿兎子糞有人進來參觀，成何體統？還不如送到民眾教育館動物園內，標上××機關贈，也好留個紀念。主任的意見固然很高明，但，我們的機關是頗民主的，主任的話，並不是聖旨，其他的意見依然有人提出有人附議。</p>
<p>意見愈來愈多，糾紛越鬧越深，而那位捉兎子的同事，既達到了他炫耀的目的，早已退身事外，不復參加這兎子的處置問題之討論了。至於那頭不幸的畜生，更是惺惺如待決的囚徒，棉花似的一團，縮在床舖底下的最暗處，似乎早已料定，人類決不會對牠有仁慈的待遇。所以任你用竹竿搗牠也好，菜葉子哄牠也好，抱定決心，一概不埋。於是這一場糾紛，也因牠的固執而暫時緩和下來。</p>
<p>第二天，同事們都出外工作去了，我是值日採買，留守。</p>
<p>把菜蔬安排妥當之後，我獨自搬了一只躺椅，坐在院子裏清閒地讀着當天的報紙。偶然回頭，忽見那頭小東西已偷偷地溜出宿舍來了。牠是那麼的小心翼翼，四面提防着牠的敵人。一雙珠紅的跟睛，睜得圓圓的，一對長毛的耳朶，到處　聽着有無敵意的響聲。前面兩條毛茸茸的短腿剛剛邁出一寸，後面的屁股趕緊一聳。我的報紙無意間擦出一點聲音，牠就連聳幾下，跑回宿舍去了。我心裏覺得頗爲　然。並不是我特別同情弱者，實在覺得人類對牠太刻毒了！沒有理由使牠親近我們或者信任我們沒有傷害牠之意。</p>
<p>第二次出來，我便盡我的力量控制自己，甚至連呼吸也减到最輕微的程度，不使牠稍微感到不安。讓牠逐漸試探看，通過院子，一直到府房門口哨一些被拋棄的菜葉。伙伕是不注意這些的。在他的限睛裏，這一塊長白毛的肉，不過是先生們買來備作打牙祭的東西與牛肉青菜等其他菜蔬一樣同爲烹調中的原料而已。既不覺得新奇，也不覺得厭惡。照常做他的工作。照常將他該拋掉的籮蔔頭從窗子裏拋出來。但，膽小的兎子，却並不明白拋東西人的用心，他立刻以最快的速率，像人類逃避炸彈一樣逃避開去。但，祇跑到一半，便緩和下來了。之從，牠認爲廚房門口一帶是危險區域，不敢再去活動。於是沿着牆壁，找其他的機會，以解決牠的生活問題。但是其他地方早經清潔運動，把那些可供食草類動物作點心用的植物剷除盡了。</p>
<p>牠把可以果腹的東西當做危險物，不敢接近，而餓着肚子在毫無希望的園地上企圖發現可口　　　。真是既可笑又可憐。過了許久，牠似乎已餓得不可忍，而我也實在忍不住了。於是輕輕的起來——雖然是輕輕的，但仍然使牠驚惶地逃到了宿舍門口。現在，宿舍已成了牠的避難所了——我便走到廚房裏檢了幾片鮮美的菜葉和一段雪白的籮蔔，仍舊坐到躺椅上，將我的好東西顯示給牠，引誘牠來享受。</p>
<p>但，牠對於人類似乎成見甚深，否則，便是牠的眼睛有毛病，祗能用鼻子臭，不能用眼睛看。任你怎樣炫耀，牠祗是不理。</p>
<p>過了一回，眼看無效，我也懶得伺候牠了。於是將菜葉蘿蔔拋在門口，仍舊看我的報紙，不去理會牠。</p>
<p>又過一陣，偶然抬頭，却發現牠在陰溝邊大嚼其菜根。此後，牠也到各處走走，參觀一番，似乎頗有常住久安之計。而對於我和伙伕這兩個僅有的人類，也不似過去那樣的懷着敵意，雖仍舊卑怯地時時留心着我們的顏色，就像新進學校門的小學生似的顯出惹人哀憐之狀。但與昨天初來時那種戰慄之狀，已大不相同了。不過，到傍晚時，大隊人馬從外邊工作歸來，牠祗好仍舊回到昨天避難的地方去獨自嚕囌。</p>
<p>如是數天，人去牠出，人歸牠人，倒也相安無事，事實上，人們也對牠已不復如初來時之熱心了。而我則因爲牠開始上借我的狀舖爲避艱所，後來即以我的箱子架爲寄宿地，覺得似有夙緣，漸漸自命爲牠的保護者了。所喜牠自奉頗儉，祗須給牠一點草葉根便够滿足了。而且牠所居之地絕不像我們常見的兎籠中的骯髒臊臭。反之，牠極顧衛生，大小便都親自上茅房，不須別人給牠端馬桶。也沒有自私自利的壞習慣，對於吃剩的蔔葡頭之類，決不存心將他藏起，以備明天的享用。雖然他是如此的懦弱，幾乎世界上所有的動物都可以欺負牠，但牠也從不悲觀，依然嚴肅地，謹慎地，坦白地，像一個修道者似的有着一顆聖潔平安的靈魂。當牠休息的時候，也像一個火候純青的長者，罇伏在廊沿下晒太陽。牠不像花貓似的假慈悲地喃喃唸着彌陀，但他却確確實實的在齋戒茹素，清靜無爲。以牠的身份，自不宜在殺伐的戰場上，或聲色犬馬的都市中生活。祗合花圃草地之間，假山湖石之隙，與蜂蝶作神仙侶。過一輩子和平恬適的生活。</p>
<p>牠是如此的誠篤，但絕不是冥頑不靈。那一對長耳朶，永遠高聳清，偶有風聲，便左右前後偵察着。及至發覺有危險可能時，早已「明哲保身」地誰也不驚動，偷偷底溜走了。萬一敵人太苛，窮迫不已，或無路可逃，或預計敵人前進的速率比自己更快，那牠也知道忿怒，知道反抗與譴責。不過牠的忿怒是禮貌的，反抗是道義的。牠不肯使用暗箭，伏兵，反噬，當然更不會使用原子彈之類秘密武器。不過用牠的葺毛樸索的後腿，在地上打出「拍拍」之聲，以警告敵人；「勿爲已甚，留些地步替子孫積點陰德！」</p>
<p>這種古道仁風的反抗，居然也常常收到效果。因爲他所遇到的敵人，並非真要致牠死命的仇敵。有時是磷舍的頑童，有時不過人們做另外一件不相干的事將牠驚動了而已。</p>
<p>惟有一次，他那種可笑的反抗失了效用。</p>
<p>是警報來了，人們都遠遠的避到了郊外，院子裏清靜得像原原一般。我因病。存着僥倖之心，擁衾坐在床上，締聽機聲。他在院子裏愉快的驅馳，如像回到了他的故鄉，不久，敵機臨空了，我的心情更緊，而他則優游依舊。再過一回，遠處炸彈響了，他突然一驚，但並未躱避，祇是不住擺動他的長耳朶，靜察事態的真相。未幾，彈又響，聲更近，這可慌了，逃到牆邊。可是無用，彈聲愈響愈近。他到處奔竄着，後腿拚命在地上拍出正義的響聲。顯然，她已陷入極度驚慌，忿怒與恐怖之中了，而我呢，比他更恐怖。立刻不顧一切，奪門而出，跳到門外一座眢井似的單人防空壕中去。不知是因我自私呢，還是因他不懂人語，我當時實在無暇招呼他。祇是在防空壕中緊張地仰視着敵機的行動。終於炸彈光臨到我們的院子裏來了。</p>
<p>也可說是僥倖，我還及時跳進了防空壕，竟然亳髮未損。也可以說不幸，一炸彈把我們辦公處的大部房屋炸毀了，尤不幸的是那隻忠厚可風的兎子，竟作了唯一的殉難者。更可歎的是當繕造損失清冊時，也無法將他列入。如他者，可算是生於憂患，長於憂患，死於憂患者矣。</p>
<h3>玉蘭（油畫）</h3>
<p>— Frans　Oerder</p>
<h3>觀畫小記</h3>
<p>— 常任俠</p>
<p>目前國畫中注入西洋畫法者，爲徐悲鴻氏一派，注入日本畫法者，爲高劍父氏一派，由放域外繪畫方法的習染，在中國現階段的藝術上，遂成一新的姿態，與傳統保守者異趣，因此也召來擁護與反對的兩種不同論調。但就在遠見者觀之，時代既變，藝術上的變化也是必然的。中國繪畫，在漢唐之間，變化最大，都是受域外的影響，宋元雖然多師　法，但其中神貌，亦頗不同。到近代以西洋畫法注入中國藝術中，朗世寗已開其端，但以目前習西畫者更盛，中畫之沾染西風，也就愈趨愈甚了。</p>
<p>能使用新的畫法，來補足中國舊畫法的缺點，在我是非常贊同的。自然舊畫法的優點，也應該努力傳承下來，集合世界藝術的優點來創造我們民族的新藝術，正是現在國人應負的責任。在舊畫法中，特別是人物畫，多只講趣味，不重形似，以致人像多先呆板千篇一律的，成爲與現實脫離的東西。現在學過西畫的來畫人物，若果其技術有相當的造就，人物多能神態栩栩，便與舊畫法不大相同了。</p>
<p>最近看到孫青羊先生的畫，青羊早歲從張紅薇，普特爾斯基游，最精透視投影。以國畫雙鈎的根底，和西畫寫生的手法，加上他慧心不遠，刻苦努力所以能融會中西之長，幻出不可多得的新格，我特別愛他晝的人物仕女，一幅採蓮女畫的是「船動湖光滟滟秋，貪看年少信船流；無端隔水拋蓮子，遙被人知半日羞。」那一首詩意，畫面布置得勻稱，採蓮女的面容，衣褶與手指，都畫得非常秀美，一幅「泛舟」是寫范蠡挾西施遊五湖圖，山水湖光，曲渚遙岑，觀之令人意遠。前一幅是他用西法寫人物的代表作，後一幅是他用透視來體置畫面的優異成績。此外他還有一幅蜀山圖，寫一山紅桃花滿上頭，蜀江春水拍山流，花紅易衰似郎意，流水不盡如儂愁」這一首詩意。山水也參用西法，獨樹一幟，而正在努力向上進步中，將來發展到如何高度，現尚難知，但業精於勤，以青羊的永遠不懈的精神，正是創造中國新藝術者，所當如此的。</p>
<h3>還鄕詩紀</h3>
<p>— 呂白華</p>
<p>南湖菱</p>
<p>漸漸，峻邁的山峯綫在望，大慨這所謂「胥山」吧！我懷念伍子胥伐楚經過這兒的一股英豪氣概，白雲淡淡浮過山頂，像襯托出古英雄的丰姿。這兒的水秀而且清，平曳似展開去，車到嘉興了。</p>
<p>在站邊圍，有兩種遺蹟却形成了巧不過而發人深思的對比。一方面纍然的墳，矗立着新碑，是抗戰成仁者的鐫功，一方面反映着殘餘的悲慘之境，敵人遺留的　迹，早晨的輕烟浮漾，觸動我們一劫中的悲慘之境，而更深的認識黷武的終歸消滅，正義必然會伸張的。我們中國有着許多伍子胥呢！</p>
<p>忽然，車窗外喊賣南湖菱，用蒲草做成盤樣，盛滿沒有角的菱子，大家都爭買着，因爲這是我國的奇產，菱，沒有角，入口確很鮮的，可是相當貴，一蒲盤二干元，小的也要五百元，據說到嘉興城裏去買不過對折的價鈿，這表現出我們商場中取巧的一角。我未能免俗，也買了一盤，嚼着南湖新味，望那環橋的湖田，菱芡滋蔓着，左面是一片綠波，想起烟雨樓「其妙在輕烟拂渚，山雨欲來時，漁船酒舸，微茫破霧」的古人幾句話，沒有機會去一看，而且湖上雖還沒烟雨，大地的陣雲又緊張着，還不到偷閒覽賞的時候。</p>
<p>鐫碑卓爾埋忠骨，</p>
<p>弔壘猶然吐劫烟；</p>
<p>聽賣南湖新味好，</p>
<p>環僑一帶綠菱田。</p>
<h3>十四行</h3>
<p>— 袁危</p>
<p>我底思想，像北冥底鵬鳥，</p>
<p>「扶搖羊角而上者九萬里」；</p>
<p>突出了地面低陋的窠巢，</p>
<p>離我去遊歷廣大的天體。</p>
<p>因聽說月亮裏嫦娥居住，</p>
<p>它便選定了第一處拜訪；</p>
<p>那兒却祇有火山底　餘，</p>
<p>沒有生命底跡象，太荒凉！</p>
<p>於是它踏上去太陽的路，</p>
<p>看到無窮的火燄，太瘋狂；</p>
<p>一個星座到另一個星座，</p>
<p>遊歷底收穫都使它失望。</p>
<p>最後還是在這一塊地上，</p>
<p>它找到了歸宿——你底心房。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　86</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>沿着這邊牆　走，確是比較危險，但這空場太寬，要想從叢林那邊，察看這後邊一帶營房，我的目力，決够不到，又不曾帶着望遠鏡，挨到叢林那邊，有何益處？而且跑過這邊十丈來寬空場的時候，目標太顯，萬一露了身形，豈非前功盡棄？同時又不願耽擱時間，走回頭路；從橫着的叢林走過去。但一想到從前我的老師說過，「窺察敵情，如不能迫近，則必需求到飽和距離」。所謂「飽和距離」，是指剛能脫離敵人的「警覺界」，而我仍可作遠距離觀察的意思。况且虎弟的眼力極強夜間亦可遠察細微，等於一副望遠鏡哩。</p>
<p>想到這裏，便決意遵從虎弟的意見，日險渡過這片空場。虎弟得了同意，立即一伏身，像脫弦的弩箭一般，一溜烟似的，奔馳過去。五六丈外，只見他的身形，如同一隻狸貓，投入茫茫夜色的籠罩中去了。候了約莫三兩分鐘，不見動靜，我也傴僂着，儘最高速度，飛奔過去。悄悄的發了一聲問訊暗號，我們又聚在一齊了。一面喘息，一面略一打量，見這裏的叢樹，和前面的佈置，一模一樣。因此悟到這裏必是禁衛區的極東地界；這叢林外邊，必是一條寬路，路外必是一帶石墻。</p>
<p>惟知我們喘息剛定，正沿叢林隱隱　藏，一前一後，向北走着的當口，虎弟忽地一轉身。打了一個警備手式。我赶忙前趨兩步，也蹲下身去。剛要問他，却已聽出了不大遠處，又有人聲和狗嗥。當下我一拉虎弟，鑽到叢樹裏面，穿了過去。果然這裏一切，正如我的揣想；大路，和石牆。</p>
<p>「來了，」我正代在地上，貼耳測聽，虎弟附　我的耳朶　告着，「又是那一套，……只有三四十碼　　了！」</p>
<p>這裏連半秒鐘的猶豫都不許可，真要當機立斷。我對虎弟打了一個手式，便伏身跨過大路，一步搶到牆邊，一搭手上了牆，略向牆外一看，見還可以落脚，便溜了下去。虎弟隨後也跟踪越過牆來。幸虧這裏牆外，也和南部那頭一樣有士坡，有濠溝式的溪水。溪水以外，茫茫一片，想是田野。我趕着潤濕了手指，伸過頭頂，一測風向，知道我們這裏正是下風頭。但在這沉悶的氣壓下，哪兒有風？也僅僅是一些些空氣的滯鈍流動而已。</p>
<p>我們藏在叢林裏面，本可躱避敵人，爲何又要越過石牆？這是完全爲了要躱避那隻狗。倒底隔了一層六七尺高的石牆，縱今狗的嗅覺厲害，人體的氣味也可隔離一些，况且還是下風頭哩。可憂的一點，倒是裏而巡邏得比較我所推算的，要緊密得多；因爲這時才八點過了幾分，前一人朝北過去不到半小時，這一個又朝南巡哨過來，那末，平均每半小時就有一輪巡哨了。可說不定，也許是一種穿梭式的雙哨？那就是說，二人同一地點出發，背道而走，各人繞一個圈子，可以同時回站。這也僅是一種猜想上的希望而已。</p>

<h3>雜誌</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>在物價繼夸高漲聲中，貧弱的出版界的奮鬥，眞是一幕泣鬼神的悲壯塲面，他們旣要生存並須顧及讀者，非個中人實難以理解其艱苦。</p>
<p>儘管環境是這樣的惡劣，上海的出版界的慘淡經營，仍有着驚人的業績，比如期刋中的「見聞」與「上海文化」　是其例，他們態度嚴肅，工作認眞，道實在令人興奮。</p>
<p>關於「見聞」，我曾經介紹過，我担心它脫期，現在還難免，其實在創始時期，它應該出半月刋的，看十時期後，人手充足，規模具備，那就不致成問題了。</p>
<p>「上海文化」無論在內容或形式上，都够稱一本極有份量的雜誌，它一期比一期進步，它將成爲讀書界的一個好友，以第八期而論，「郁達夫先生殉難前後紀詳」和「日本問題座談會」的紀錄，都是極有價値而不可多得的文章。</p>
<p>上海紙迷金醉，老實說大多數人都無心讀書，尤其是這兩本水準以上並不通俗的雜誌，和　現象，自在意中，因之，我願意貢獻一點小意見給它們的主持人，向內地發展，發行以內地爲重心，因爲內地讀者文化飢餓，極需精神食糧的。</p>
<p>國外瑣聞</p>
<h3>法國的昭君怨</h3>
<p>— 陸士雄</p>
<p>美國遠征軍人與當地異國女子結婚的在今　戰事中爲數非鮮。法國女子的香艷韻事，是歷來有名的。美軍在法國時與當地女子訂白首之盟的，自亦甚多。這些女子倒並不完全是法國籍，亦有比利時，波蘭，捷克，荷蘭等國的女子，因戰亂中逃避而來此住下的。</p>
<p>法方當局爲妥善計，凡是嫁給美軍的新娘，不要使她們像水銀瀉地一樣的流來流去，當她們離國以前，把她們集中起來，送到巴黎附近奧溪（Orcher）地方的一所慈善集中營裏，集中管理，所以與美軍結婚以後，先遭小鳥入籠般的軟禁生活，以代卿卿我我的蜜月旅行，確是大殺風景！</p>
<p>有些女子，固然因爲山盟海誓情深愛堅，所以亦樂於暫時忍受軟禁的痛苦。但亦有於最後一分鐘臨時起變卦的。當她們姍姍而在巴黎以外的臨時集中營時，許多美國的丈夫，沿路予以安慰和鼓勵，還有那些德國戰俘，臨時權充護花使者，替新娘們忙着搬運嫁　行李。</p>
<p>當合　後的第一夜，她們並不覺得愉快，原因倒非爲了物質享受的困苦，實在是不慣那樊籠中沉悶的生活！有一位女子名珍妮的，在鉛絲網裏向外望到了祖國的土地景物，驟然感到留戀不忍離開，故於最後一分鐘解除了婚約。珍妮是法國的女子，她說：與其到了美國再回來，不若目前就把一縷情絲，一刀兩斷，比較痛快得多！</p>
<p>有一個名叫瑪麗的女子，她倒不同，她很願意和美國的丈夫白首偕老。從前她曾在德軍的鐵蹄下飽受病楚，過着幾年的囚禁生活，當她們被解放後，她遇到了她的英雄伴侶。現在她雖已解放，並不久可到美洲的金元國，可是暫時又要重溫那拘禁的舊課。舊怨新愁，使她啼笑皆非。在瑪麗的小皮箱內，藏着一支手槍，當進入集中營時，被守衛的搜查出來，予以沒收。她那時正是「梨花一枝春帶雨」的哭泣起來，她說：這是我目衛用的紀念品，守衛者雖然相信和同情，可是爲安全計，仍然照章沒收。</p>
<h3>民主開端</h3>
<p>— 一粟</p>
<p>誰說老百姓不中用，請看一看杭州市的參議員，居然有身爲人力車夫趙廷秀一人。據此，便知道老百姓畢竟在幾千年的封建制庭下的傳統觀念裏抬頭了，解放了。雖然那不　是一個渺小的開端，然而沒有原始點滴的雨珠，怎能　源成現在那　　汹湧的洋海江河；尤其是當國民大會行將召開的前夕，緬懷國父遺敎「還政於民」的偉大希望，更顯出牠那朝日般動人的光芒。</p>
<p>我們殷盼這風氣能蔓延到全國地方的每一個參議會。</p>
<p>不過，另一面，我們仍不能不熱望人民敎育水準的普遍提高，否則，農工階級的參政，便不免徒具形　而已！</p>

<h3>誰偷了錢？</h3>
<p>— 嘉金</p>
<p>凱德先生（H　.Cady）向威斯康丁某圖書館借到一本遠期的「工業工程化學」，館方規定借閱時間不得超過一月，否則罰款一元。凱德先生後因旅行赴田納西未返，僕人布朗德收到催　通知單一份，凱德歸家時始憶及此事，即以美鈔一元交布，令其速將該書歸還。再一週，該館復來一通知云：「書雖自郵局交至，惟罰款匯票尙未收到」。凱德即以此事見詢於布曰：「此事究竟如何」？布回曰：「一週前因見匯款太少，且手續甚繁，故即將美鈔一元夾於該書五十三與五十四頁之間由郵寄出」。言畢，更以郵局掛號收據爲證。凱德苦思良久，不解此款究爲何人所取。午睡時，隨手自書架上取得一冊讀者文摘，閱讀間，突發見此款定爲布僕所取，並未寄出。聰明的讀者們：你能猜猜那本讀者文摘上告訴他什麼？</p>

<p>在燈下讀完了「世界末日」這　寓言（載十一月一日本刋）使我萬分感動，幾乎不能自持。總算謝天謝地，「世界末日」裏說，在那一次浩刦之後，世界上還保留了一個有生殖能力的男子。總爲人類留下了一綫希望。那「寓言」最後還有一連串神秘的「……」這正包含了說不　的　　萬語，與無量的　和　！找忍不住爲這一連串神秘的「……」而激動，而遐想，……乃至　着報紙昏昏地睡去了。我做了一夜天的夢：</p>
<p>自從那時候起，全世界的報紙，天天都以頭條長欄新聞地位競載那一個男子的消息；各國的雜誌刋物，也都經常以大半的篇幅記載。那個男子的名字已經是全人類家喻戶曉的了；事實上，那個男子已經成了全人類共同的一個希望，一個太陽，一個神。</p>
<p>那一個男子却吸引了全世界的注意力，成了國際間一個空前的重大爭點！誰　希望能把那個男子搶到手，好　自己的國家民族不致絕種，並且能進而統制世界。</p>
<p>這種情形一直繼績着，有增無已；大有一觸即發之勢。使得全人類都惶惶終日，準備迎接那即將臨頭的曠古未有的大屠殺。那時候，美國人自然比別國人更感不安，因爲那全世界僅有的一個有生殖能力的男子是屬於美國的。爲了防範未然計，美國不得不挺身出來號召從新組織一個新的國際機構，專門來研究討論這一個空前嚴重的世界問題——全人類如何共享那個男子。</p>
<p>也不知經過了多少次數的討論，爭吵，和　差一口氣就要翻臉的危機，好容易才勉强　得了協議，訂立了一個「人類綿延生命的大憲章」。</p>
<p>人們正在狂歡地慶祝這「大憲章」給人類帶來了新的希望的時候，不料新的問題又爆發了！——原來也許是因爲那些外交家都吵昏了，「大憲章」裏竟遺漏了一節關於那男子將來週遊各國的程序的規定！該孰先孰後呢？</p>
<p>這一個新的問題又把國際關係弄僵了！頓使全人類莫不爲之失色。幾經折衝，甚麼辦法都想出了：有人主張按地理形勢，自美國出發，環球順序而有；有人主張依大中小國的秩序；有人主張按國名首字字母順序走；各種主張都被那些被排列在後面的國家堅決推翻了。最後大家　好想出抽籤決定一法。但該由誰來主持抽籤呢？又是一難關！</p>
<p>抽籤期到，有人提出否決，說是主辦者有弊端。國際上的兩個集團依然不能相讓，且有人企圖以科學方法生殖人類，大家胸有成竹，你不怕我，我不怕你。</p>
<p>若干年後，那唯一的男神不曾生育第二代，那些夢想的科學家也沒有造出科學人。</p>

<p>###策反投機終難倖免 周逆佛海判處極刑</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] The treacherous Zhou Fohai, who practiced "two-faced politics" and was "multi-talented" and "chameleon-like," was sentenced to death by the Capital High Court on the morning of the 7th, with lifelong deprivation of civil rights, and all property confiscated except for a discretionary allowance for family living expenses. At 8:00 AM, Zhou and Luo Junqiang were escorted to Chaotian Palace and detained in a suite of the waiting room. At 8:50 AM, Court President Luo Yunxie, along with Judges Ge Zhaosu and Li An, and female Clerk Huang Shu, convened a panel in the Dacheng Hall to investigate Luo's crimes. Zhou was brought in to testify. Five minutes later, under the escort of military police, Zhou walked through the crowd and stood at the interrogation stand. Zhou wore a deep blue cloth robe, a small Qing-era style jacket and trousers, gray woolen socks, and black round-toe leather shoes. He wore glasses with yellow rims, and appeared calm and composed. The court first questioned him about his relationship with Luo and Luo's role in serving in puppet positions. Then, they delved into their collaboration in the counter-insurgency efforts, the poisoning of Li Shiqun, and the provision of military intelligence. At 9:15 AM, Luo was brought back for interrogation. The testimonies of the two criminals were consistent, and their calm and loquacious demeanor, as well as their smiles while boasting of their merits, were also similar. Subsequently, witness Wang Kexiu (also known as Ma Guangzeng) testified about his work as a member of the Literary and Arts Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Party during the occupation, engaging in underground activities and organizing the Founding the Nation Society, and how he managed to obtain intelligence from Luo Kexin, the secretary-general of the Shanghai Municipal Party. Witness Zhang Junsheng testified about his connection with Luo as ordered by the Military Intelligence Bureau. Zhang also confirmed that the handwritten letter from the late Director Dai in the presented evidence was genuine (the letter contained much encouragement, and included the phrase "I will take responsibility for everything here"). After reading the transcript, the court adjourned at 10:30 AM.</p>
<p>At 10:35 AM, Court President Jin Shiding and Judges Wang Hongquan and Shentu Chen convened a panel to reinvestigate Zhou Fohai to testify in the case of Yang Xinghua. Zhou first denied the allegation of reporting Tian Renzuan's embezzlement, stating that he had no memory of such a matter. He then described how Yang assisted him in his work, obtaining and transmitting intelligence about the enemy's invasion strategy in Xiang and Gui. The interrogation concluded at 11:15 AM. Chief Prosecutor Chen Shengzu of the Zhou case joined the original court to begin sentencing.</p>
<p>After everyone in the courtroom stood up, President Jin read the main text of the judgment in a solemn and firm tone: "Zhou Fohai is guilty of conspiring with an enemy country to plot against his own country and is sentenced to death. All property, except for a discretionary allowance for necessary family living expenses, is to be confiscated."</p>
<p>Zhou listened to the verdict with extreme tension, his face yellow but maintaining composure. President Jin continued reading a section of the judgment's reasoning and turned to a consoling tone, saying: "The defendant's circumstances are serious, and his position is important. This court, in accordance with the law and fairness, has imposed the death penalty. However, this is not the final verdict. According to the law, it must be submitted to the Supreme Court for review and decision. If there is absolutely no room for reversal in terms of the law, the central government may consider the merits of the counter-insurgency effort and may, through administrative discretion, commute the sentence by granting special amnesty or reducing the penalty." After finishing, he ordered Zhou to be taken back into custody. It was 11:30 AM. Zhou tightly pursed his lips, widened his eyes, and fiercely walked out of the courtroom, escorted back to the waiting room by court personnel. He and Luo were then taken back to the Tiger Bridge Detention Center in the same car.</p>
<p>High Court President and Prosecutor Believe the Sentence Was Fair</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] The death sentence of Zhou has been well-received here, with many feeling that the court's enforcement of the law was strict and fair, and that Zhou deserved his punishment. Over five thousand members of the public who were observing the sentencing applauded. They continued to discuss the matter even after Zhou was taken away. They admired the High Court's respect for national law and the maintenance of national integrity, and its spirit of imposing the death penalty on a major traitor after thorough discussion. However, they were concerned that Zhou, with his wide connections and wealth, would vigorously seek to avoid death. Zhao Chen, the President of the Zhou case trial, said after the sentencing: "Zhou was quite talented. If he had followed the national policy of resistance and obeyed the leadership, his political future would have been unlimited. However, due to his lack of firm will, he turned to speculation and was ultimately convicted of treason. It is deeply regrettable from the perspective of cherishing talent, but the court must uphold the law, and Zhou's treasonous acts are undeniable. Therefore, the death penalty was imposed. As for the possibility of reducing the sentence through political rights, it depends on how the authorities weigh the situation. Considering the example of the French court sentencing Laval and Pétain to death, the merits of these two French traitors should not be less than those of Zhou. However, Laval could not escape his fate, while Pétain, due to his distinguished service in the previous World War and his advanced age, was granted a special amnesty and reduced sentence by de Gaulle. Therefore, the authorities must carefully consider public opinion and consult extensively before exercising this political right." Chen Shengzu, the prosecutor in charge of Zhou's case, told our reporter: "There should be no doubt that Zhou should be sentenced to death. The judicial organs only know the law and do not consider other factors. If Zhou's heinous crimes can still be forgiven, it would damage the dignity of the law, and I would have to appeal. I believe that this wise judgment has already become final, and that the highest judicial authorities and the executive branch will value national discipline, national integrity, and the public opinion of the people, and will not allow this opportunistic traitor to escape justice."</p>

<h3>Zhou Fohai Before and After the Sentencing Demanded a Fair Judgment Before the Sentencing Tears Flowed After the Death Sentence</h3>
<p>[Special Report] The 7th was the day of the final verdict for the major traitor Zhou Fohai. Jianye Road was packed with people, especially newly opened reporters who were eager to capture the final sentencing scene in the crackdown on traitors. In the past few days, opinions have varied in the capital regarding Zhou Fohai's sentence. "Death penalty," "life imprisonment," "acquittal" - all of these possibilities were being debated. This mystery could only be revealed in the Dacheng Hall.</p>
<p>In the past few days, Zhou's family has been busy, as have the defense lawyers. The traitor suppression authorities recently received a statement from the High Court regarding Zhou's defense. He said: "During the emergency of the Xiang-Gui War, he had secret intelligence, supplied it to the Military Intelligence Bureau, exposed the enemy's troop movements, and launched a large-scale suppression campaign, which was forwarded to the central government by the Military Intelligence Bureau." The Military Intelligence Bureau received this official document and naturally had to respond. However, based on the actual situation at the time, if Zhou Fohai had had intelligence at the time, the retreat from Xiang-Gui would not have been so disastrous. We see that in the interrogation by the Capital High Court, President Zhao and Prosecutor Chen refuted him so thoroughly that he was left without any defense. The number one traitor who sold out the country and colluded with the enemy should of course be subjected to the most severe penalty of the state law, without a doubt.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, reporters rushed to Tiger Bridge Prison to wait. At around 8 o'clock, the prosecutor led a team of bailiffs and police officers from the Internal Security Corps, more than a dozen in total, driving a Japanese-style truck. The reporters followed them to the Zhongzi Prison. At this time, Zhou Fohai, Luo Junqiang, and Ding Mocun all came together. Luo Junqiang had his hair slicked back, still with the air of a "minister" from the past. Zhou Fohai changed into a blue cloth robe yesterday and also looked elegant. Luo Junqiang was being interrogated again. Ding Mocun stood aside, mentally very uncomfortable. There was no news, and it was unknown whether it was good or bad, which made him very anxious. He even hesitantly asked a bailiff: "How is my news?" The bailiff naturally ignored him. After Zhou Fohai and Luo Junqiang were taken away, Ding said: "Brother Zhou, I hope you bring back good news," his words filled with bitterness.</p>
<p>At 8:30 AM, they were escorted from Tiger Bridge. Zhou Fohai and Luo Junqiang sat next to the driver, talking and laughing. Coincidentally, there was a hole in the glass next to the driver's seat. The reporter, taking advantage of this opportunity, with the permission of the bailiff, began to talk to Zhou:</p>
<p>"I heard that public opinion has not been very favorable to you recently. What are your feelings?"</p>
<p>"Of course, I know my own affairs, but it is a fact that I surrendered and contacted the central government. Chairman Chiang is also clear about this."</p>
<p>"Your contact with the Military Intelligence Bureau is said to be a 'two-faced' approach. What exactly is going on?"</p>
<p>"Cheng Kequn is not dead. You can ask him. Zhou Hao of the Military Intelligence Bureau testified for me in court. Of course, it can't be fake."</p>
<p>"The court announced that your contact with the Military Intelligence Bureau was entirely your means of conspiring with the enemy and leaking our country's secrets. How do you explain this?"</p>
<p>"It's hard to explain, but it's not easy to establish a radio station, and it's not easy to obtain intelligence. That's probably what he's referring to!"</p>
<p>"Will the court sentence you to 'death,' 'life imprisonment,' or 'acquittal' today?"</p>
<p>"That's hard to say."</p>
<p>"What if you are sentenced to death?"</p>
<p>"I am willing to obey the national law, but the scale must be fair."</p>
<p>Chaotian Palace arrived, and our conversation ended in the mixed voices of the crowd.</p>
<p>The Dacheng Hall and the square inside were still crowded, the only difference being that there were no loudspeakers. At 9 o'clock, the presiding judge took the stand and began interrogating Luo Junqiang first. The court questioned and refuted at the same time, and Luo Junqiang was quite frustrated. Zhou Fohai and Luo Junqiang were together, with a joint relationship, and testifying for Luo was no different from defending himself. Lawyer Xue Songqi submitted powerful evidence for Luo, claiming it was the late Director Dai of the Military Intelligence Bureau's own handwriting. The reporter saw that it was written in bold fountain pen. The court read aloud: "Brother Junqiang, Greetings. Long time no see, I miss you very much. I learned from Brother Junsheng that you have been working hard for the country over the years and caring about old friends. I am very impressed and concerned. Now is the best time for those with ambitions to serve the country and be loyal to the leader under the coercion of the enemy for many years. Please contact all parties with ambitions, unite all useful forces that can be controlled, adapt to the times, and coordinate actions. I will take responsibility for everything here. The rest will be presented in person by Comrade Junsheng. I respectfully wish you great health. Your brother, Yushang, July 29." Zhang Junsheng also testified for him today. Luo Junqiang seemed pleased after this passage was read. After one session ended, the second session began. The clerk read the record, and the presiding judge first asked about the matter of Yang Xinghua and other things.</p>
<p>At 11:15, Prosecutor Chen arrived at the court. Presiding Judge Jin Shiding announced in a loud voice, "Sentencing." At this time, there was a commotion among the audience. Zhou Fohai stood motionless at the defendant's stand. The presiding judge immediately announced the main text of the death sentence for Zhou Fohai. Zhou trembled slightly. Judge Jin continued, "Zhou Fohai, this court has sentenced you to death. You can still appeal to the Supreme Court. The highest authorities can commute your sentence, and you may not die." He announced the adjournment, and Zhou left without saying a word, walking out with his head held high. The bailiffs escorted him to the car. The reporter finally had another conversation with Zhou just before leaving Chaotian Palace. The reporter asked him:</p>
<p>"What do you feel about being sentenced to death?"</p>
<p>"This is the national law, but the scale is a bit too tilted. Is my merit not needed?"</p>
<p>"Are you still appealing?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Did you hear the presiding judge's last words?"</p>
<p>"I heard them, sir. Zhou Fohai's fate was not decided today. It was already sealed the day the late Director Dai died. Only the late Director Dai knew my actions best. If he were here, he could have cleared my name. Now that he is dead, what is there? If I die, I will miss General Dai even more, China's outstanding intelligence talent. The presiding judge's words may have been to comfort me." At this point, Zhou shed tears, one by one.</p>
<p>The bailiffs urged the driver to start the car. At the reporter's request, Zhou Fohai left the words "The truth will be known ten years later" on the reporter's notepad. Zhou Fohai will inevitably become the successor of Lin Baisheng and Mei Siping at Tiger Bridge!</p>

Chairman Chiang agreed to his eight proposals. After one procedure was completed, the mediator, in view of the fact that the previous suggestions made in an estimated manner were rejected by the Communist Party, first sought the opinion of the Communist Party this time. Zhou Enlai then proposed nine proposals (five political and four military). This compromise suggestion was immediately made based on the opinions of both sides.

<h3>和談已漸趨黯澹 政府正待中共具體表示 對調人建議今可提答覆</h3>
<h3>Peace Talks Gradually Dimming The Government Awaits a Concrete Statement from the CCP A Response to the Mediators' Proposals May Be Submitted Today</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] The peace talks have made no progress as of today. According to a representative of the government, the government hopes that negotiations will be realized as soon as possible, but negotiations without end will not produce results. In other words, there must be a basis for negotiation, but the CCP has not yet made a genuine statement. It is feared that there will be no progress in the current situation.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 7th] According to a government source, government representatives consulted with Chairman Chiang on the evening of the 7th and decided not to resume negotiations until the Communist Party formally responds to the eight proposals made by Chairman Chiang. As of now, the Communist Party has not responded. When Wu Tiecheng and Shao Lizi met with Zhou Enlai in Shanghai, Zhou had already stated the Communist Party's position. A Communist Party spokesman said: This action is unnecessary because the Communist Party's position has undoubtedly been conveyed to Chairman Chiang. At the same time, the CCP will consider whether to submit a formal response to the eight proposals, which will be forwarded to Chairman Chiang by Special Envoy Marshall. Tonight's developments seem to make the complex political situation even darker, and it seems impossible to resume negotiations before the National Assembly convenes. Envoy Marshall and Minister Stuart met with Chairman Chiang before the government representatives met with Chairman Chiang, and then discussed with Zhou Enlai, Luo Longji, Zhang Junli, and other mediators.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] Government representative Sun Ke returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 7th. All government representatives met at Sun's residence at 9:00 AM to discuss the proposals made by the mediators. After careful study, they went to dinner at the Chairman's invitation at 7:30 PM and reported everything on the spot, and did not leave until about 10:00 PM. Subsequently, the government representatives gathered again to discuss, and did not return to their residences until 11:45 PM. When the reporter waited for Lei Zhen and asked about the Chairman's instructions, he said that there was no response to the previous proposals today, and the government will consider it again or respond on the afternoon of the 8th. It is understood that the focus of the current problem is not on the form of negotiation, but on the content of the negotiation. Therefore, the Chairman's call and the government representatives' meeting on the 7th were all to study the content in detail.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] The Youth Party, the Democratic League, and representatives from various social circles will continue to meet at the Bank of Communications at 10:00 AM on the 9th. Luo Longji, Zhang Junmai, and Ying Ketu will host a banquet at noon. There will be no major activities in the afternoon. Zhang Shenfu and others visited Zhou Enlai in the evening but did not meet him. The rest went to the Soviet ambassador's cocktail party. They all seemed to be waiting for the government's response. They will gather as usual on the 8th. Special Envoy Marshall visited Stuart in the morning and talked for two hours.</p>

<h3>Korean Delegation Receives Reporters: Denies Rumors of Anti-Chinese Sentiment in South Korea, Emphasizes the Importance of Sino-Korean Friendship</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] The Korean Delegation to China received the Chinese press at 3 pm on the 7th, hosted by Min Seokrin. A statement was issued regarding the "Anti-Chinese Incident in Korea", stating: The news in the newspapers on the 4th that an anti-Chinese incident occurred in Korea is completely inconsistent with the facts. It further stated: After the establishment of the US military government in South Korea, in view of the fact that a few people took violent actions against overseas Chinese when the first batch of Korean expatriates were repatriated from China, in retaliation for their experiences in China, fearing that this would cause widespread resentment, various measures were taken when the second batch of repatriation ships entered the port to strictly prohibit anti-Chinese or retaliatory acts, and solemnly declared that serious punishments would be imposed if such incidents occurred. Therefore, no anti-Chinese or retaliatory acts have occurred among Koreans returning to Korea from China. After our Provisional Government returned to Korea, in view of the importance of Sino-Korean national friendship, Zhao Suang, Shin Yi-hee, and domestic celebrities such as Ahn Jae-hong organized the Sino-Korean Friendship Association to engage in friendship work. When the overseas Chinese left Korea and returned to China this time, the Korean National Defense Guard gave them special treatment and provided all conveniences. The Korean representative also made a sincere speech, stating that the overseas Chinese returned to China this time voluntarily, and hoped that they would still live in Korea soon, and asked everyone to forgive and help the Korean expatriates in China. Before the ship sailed, the Koreans shouted "Long live the Republic of China!" "Long live Chairman Chiang!" to boost their morale. All of the above are accurate facts.</p>
<h3>Various Railways Actively Repaired: The Northern Section of the Beiping-Hankou Railway is Being Repaired Along with the Army; The Beiping-Zhangjiakou Section Can Be Open to Traffic on the 10th</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] The railway repair work in the pacification zone is becoming more active with the military progress. The following is a summary of the road restoration situation from June to the end of October: Jiaoji Railway: Cangko-Dagu River section 41 kilometers, Guodian-Tanjiafang section 146 kilometers, Nanding-Boshan section 33 kilometers, Fangzi-Xiaogu section 9 kilometers. Jinpu Railway: Liguo-Lincheng section 25 kilometers. Longhai Railway: Damiao-Daxujia section 7.5 kilometers, Kaifeng-Xuzhou section 80 kilometers, Luowang-Dashan section 163 kilometers. Zhengtai Railway: Weishui-Luanchuan section 58 kilometers, Yuci-Touquan section 41 kilometers, Shanghu-Shouyang section 12 kilometers. Pingsui Railway: Sandaoying-Datong section 224 kilometers, Qinglongqiao-Huailai section 23 kilometers, Zhangjiakou-Xuanhua section 32 kilometers. (The remaining Datong-Zhangjiakou section 182 kilometers, Xuanhua-Huailai section 73 kilometers are under repair). The northern section of the Beiping-Hankou Railway has recently been destroyed and is being repaired along with the army.</p>
<p>[Our Northern Beijing Office, 7th] After the communist army in the northern section of the Beiping-Hankou Railway carried out large-scale destruction, the traffic situation in North China has improved compared with the past due to the efforts of the National Army to maintain and expand various lines. The number of sabotage incidents on the Beining Road has decreased compared to the past, and traffic is occasionally blocked. The Pingsui Line is about to complete the repair work on the Beiping-Zhangjiakou section, and it can be opened to traffic on the 10th. Currently, military vehicles are traveling to Huailai, and passenger cars are traveling to Kangzhuang. This section of the highway has also been completed, and freight vehicles are running smoothly. The Beicheng Line's northbound trains have reached Shili. The highway on this line can also directly reach Chengping from the 8th, handling passenger and freight transportation. The Jinpu Line is still open to Cangxian by the army. Because the southwest of Tianjin is a major base for the communist army, small groups of communist troops still occasionally attempt to sabotage the railway in the Tangguantun and Machang areas. The National Army is heavily guarded. After the Beiping-Baoding section of the Beiping-Hankou Road was opened, the communist army has lost its counter-offensive power. The repair work can reach Dingxing on the 7th, and this section of the highway can be repaired. At that time, about 100 trucks will replace the joint transportation by fire and military. The four stations of Yujiazhuang, Fangshunqiao, Wangdu, and Qingfengdian in Baoding South are still in the hands of the communist army. The northbound trains from Shijiazhuang are now traveling to Dingxian, and the opening of the four stations in the middle is not far away. The main force of the communist army in Rehe Province has mostly moved to the Northeast, and a small part is lurking on the Outer Great Wall Line. There are occasional small destructions between Pingquan and Lingyuan on the Jincheng Line. A section was destroyed by thirty bandits the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>[Our Northern Beijing Office, 7th] Traffic News: The repair of the Pingzhang section of the Pingsui Road is progressing rapidly, and it is expected to be connected near Shacheng on November 8. The Beiping-Tianjin Railway Administration is preparing to test the train on the 15th of this month.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] In the autumn of the 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944), the enemy invaded Hengyang from the south. The defending army bravely resisted the enemy in the isolated city for as long as 47 days, unfolding one of the most magnificent and glorious pages in the history of the War of Resistance.

<h3>Judgment on the Case of Traitor Zhou Fohai</h3>
<p>Special Criminal Judgment of the Capital High Court (Thirty-fifth Year, Special Character No. 346)</p>
<p>Prosecutor: Prosecutor of this Court</p>
<p>Defendant: Zhou Fohai, male, fifty years old, native of Yuanling County, Hunan Province, former Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, residing at No. 8, Xiliu Bay, Nanjing, currently in custody.</p>
<p>Appointed Defense Attorneys: Lawyer Zhang Shizhao</p>
<p>Lawyer Wang Shanxiang</p>
<p>Lawyer Yang Jialin</p>
<p>The above-named defendant, due to the case of being a traitor, having been prosecuted by the prosecutor, this Court judges as follows:</p>
<p>Main Text</p>
<p>Zhou Fohai colluded with an enemy country, plotted to resist his own country, sentenced to death, deprived of all public rights for life, and all property confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for his family, which shall be retained.</p>
<p>Facts</p>
<p>Intentional Betrayal, Violation of Established National Policy</p>
<p>During his studies in Japan, Zhou Fohai was originally a member of the Communist Party, later joining the Kuomintang, and successively served as Director of the Political Department of the General Headquarters of the National Revolutionary Army, Member of the Jiangsu Provincial Government concurrently Director of the Department of Education, Minister of the Central People's Training Department, and Minister of the Central Propaganda Department. In the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), the Sino-Japanese War broke out, and the enemy's forces were rampant. During the fierce Battle of Shanghai, Zhou Fohai, together with Mei Siping, Gao Zongwu, and others, secretly discussed making peace at his home (No. 8, Xiliu Bay, Nanjing), which was then known as the "Low-Key Club." After the fall of Nanjing and Shanghai, the National Government decided on a long-term resistance and moved west to Chongqing. Zhou Fohai then intentionally violated the central government's established national policy, taking Wang Jingwei as the center and brewing a peace movement, becoming even more active. First, Mei Siping and Gao Zongwu secretly went to Shanghai in mid-November of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938) to discuss a basic plan for peace that would cede rights and humiliate the country with Yoshibumi Kageyama and Imai Takeo, representatives of the Japanese military. Then, on November 27th, they transferred from Shanghai to Hong Kong and flew to Chongqing, secretly reporting to Wang Jingwei. After Wang Jingwei approved, Zhou Fohai intentionally betrayed the central government, under the pretext of the Minister of the Central Propaganda Department going out to inspect, first left Chongqing on December 6th for Kunming, and on the 19th of the same month, transferred to Hanoi, Vietnam. Wang Jingwei also fled to Hanoi on the 20th. On the 23rd, Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe, based on the conditions negotiated by Mei Siping and others, issued a statement. Wang Jingwei also drafted a telegram, which he handed over to Zhou Fohai, Chen Gongbo, and others to take to Hong Kong, and handed it over to Lin Baisheng and Mei Siping to jointly sign and be responsible for, and sent it to the newspaper on the night of the 30th for publication (delayed for one day due to Gu Mengyu's opposition), responding to Konoe's statement, hoping to confuse public opinion and shake the determination to resist.</p>
<p>Secret Negotiations with the Enemy, Constantly Following Wang Jingwei</p>
<p>On April 12th of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939), Zhou Fohai and Mei Siping went to Shanghai together to gather party members and promote the peace movement. Soon, Gao Zongwu and Wang Jingwei also arrived in Shanghai one after another, and they discussed with Kageyama Yoshisada and others to obtain the consent of the enemy authorities. Zhou Fohai, Mei Siping, Gao Zongwu, Zhou Longku, and others accompanied Wang Jingwei to Tokyo, Japan, to secretly discuss peace conditions with enemy leaders. After returning to China, they once again used peace, anti-communism, and nation-building as slogans, and held the Sixth Pseudo-National Congress of the Kuomintang in Shanghai, issuing a declaration. Zhou Fohai was elected as a Standing Committee Member of the Pseudo-Central Executive Committee. In November, he, together with Mei Siping, Lin Baisheng, Zhou Longxiang, Gao Zongwu, and others, discussed the "Draft of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty" with Japanese representatives Kageyama Yoshizaki and Suga. Later, Gao Zongwu and others discovered their conscience and went to Hong Kong, exposing the inside story in the Ta Kung Pao, and then fled to the rear. Zhou Fohai, however, remained obsessed and followed Wang Jingwei. On January 20th of the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), he attended the Qingdao Conference, where he discussed reorganization issues with the "Provisional" and "Reform" puppet governments. He also participated in the pseudo-Central Political Conference from March 20th to 22nd of the same year, which decided on the plan for adjusting the new Sino-Japanese relationship, the program of the pseudo-National Government, the organizational regulations of the pseudo-Central Political Committee and the pseudo-North China Political Affairs Committee, and determined the name of the pseudo-National Government, and appointed candidates for various courts and departments.</p>
<p>Serving in Various Pseudo-Positions, Following the Will of the Japanese Invaders</p>
<p>On March 30th, the pseudo-National Government was jointly established in Nanjing in the manner of the National Government returning to its capital, and it issued a declaration that all government orders and treaties and agreements of our National Government, both domestic and foreign, were invalid. Wang Jingwei himself served as Chairman and concurrently President of the Pseudo-Executive Yuan, Zhou Fohai served as Minister of the Pseudo-Ministry of Finance, and also served concurrently as Standing Committee Member of the Pseudo-Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters Executive Committee, Chairman of the Pseudo-Central Financial Committee, Member and Secretary-General of the Pseudo-Central Political Committee, Member and Secretary-General of the Pseudo-Supreme National Defense Conference, Member of the Pseudo-Military Commission, Vice President of the Pseudo-Executive Yuan, President of the Pseudo-Central Reserve Bank, Chief of the Pseudo-Tax Police Regiment, Chairman of the Pseudo-Enemy Property Management Committee, Chairman of the Pseudo-Materials Control Review Committee, and Deputy Chairman of the Pseudo-Military Commission. He also held positions such as Member of the Rural Clearing Committee, Mayor of the Pseudo-Shanghai Special Municipality concurrently Commander of the Pseudo-Shanghai Security Forces and Director of the Shanghai Special Municipality Police Bureau, holding great power and highly trusted by Wang Jingwei. During his tenure in the pseudo-positions, he followed the will of the Japanese invaders, issued counterfeit currency wantonly, disrupted finance, and supplied the enemy with money and materials, in order to increase the strength of the enemy's invasion. On November 30th of the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), the Pseudo-National Government officially signed the "Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty" with the Japanese invaders in Nanjing, allowing the Japanese invaders to station troops in Mengjiang and North China, and station fleets in our country's territorial waters and rivers, and implement economic cooperation. At the same time, it issued a joint declaration between China, Japan, and Manchuria, recognizing the Pseudo-Manchukuo, in order to destroy the integrity of our country's territory. On June 14th of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941), Zhou Fohai accompanied Wang Jingwei to visit the Japanese government and people, and concluded an agreement on the conversion of foreign funds of the pseudo-Central Reserve Bank into Japanese yen, and borrowed 300 million Japanese yen to support the pseudo-government's economy. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he echoed the Japanese invaders and declared war on the Allied nations of Britain and the United States on January 9th of the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943) in the name of the pseudo-National Government. On October 30th of the same year, he concluded a treaty of alliance with the Japanese invaders, declaring that they would live and die together. Zhou Fohai also visited Pseudo-Manchukuo in the name of a special envoy, in order to flatter the enemy. Other crimes of harming the country and the people are too numerous to mention. Zhou Fohai attached himself to Wang Jingwei, openly advocating peace, and participated in it until the Japanese invaders surrendered and the pseudo-organization disintegrated. He was induced and arrested by the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Commission and transferred to the prosecutor of this court for prosecution.</p>
<p>Reasons</p>
<p>In this case, the defendant Zhou Fohai, regarding the above-mentioned attachment to Wang Jingwei, violating the central government's established national policy, privately advocating peace, secretly negotiating conditions with the Japanese invaders to cede rights and humiliate the country, to the point of jointly organizing the pseudo-National Government, signing the "Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty," allowing the Japanese invaders to station troops and warships in our country's territory, implementing economic cooperation, and issuing a joint declaration between China, Japan, and Manchukuo, recognizing Pseudo-Manchukuo, destroying the integrity of the territory, declaring war on the Allied nations of Britain and the United States in the name of the pseudo-government, the defendant visiting Pseudo-Manchukuo in the name of a pseudo-envoy, the pseudo-Central Reserve Bank he presided over issuing 41 trillion yuan of counterfeit currency, prohibiting the people from using legal tender, disrupting finance, supplying the enemy with money and materials, and serving in various important pseudo-positions in both the party and government, until the surrender of the Japanese invaders, all of these circumstances have been confessed in detail and without reservation during similar investigations or trials, and can be proven by publications such as the pseudo-"National Government Gazette," the pseudo-"Ministry of Finance Gazette," the pseudo-Propaganda Department's compiled "Peace, Anti-Communism, and Nation-Building Documents," "Chairman Wang's Speeches During His Visit to Japan," "Chairman Wang's Visit to Japan Memorial Pictorial," and "Selected Capitals in the Fourth Year Pictorial," and the Japanese Yoshida Jizo's edited "The Current Situation in Central China" (a separate catalog is attached to this judgment). In addition, after the organization of the pseudo-government, he shamelessly served the enemy and acted as an accomplice, and his evil deeds of harming the country and the people are not only sufficient to prove by various pseudo-official documents and newspaper clippings at the time, but also are commonly seen and heard by Chinese and foreign people. It is undoubtedly and undeniably that the fact that the defendant colluded with Wang Jingwei and others to collude with an enemy country and plotted to resist his own country has been clearly and obviously established. However, what should be investigated is whether the defendant's reasons for defense can be established, which are discussed separately below:</p>
<p>No Room for Sophistry, the Pseudo-Government Harmed the Country and the People</p>
<p>(1) According to the defense, the organization of the pseudo-government was to test peace, shake the enemy's military morale, reduce the suffering of the people in the occupied areas, and that the organization of the pseudo-government in the occupied areas had no impact on the anti-Japanese camp. However, resistance to the end was the central government's established national policy. On November 12th of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), the National Government moved to Chongqing and declared, "Recently, the violent Japanese have become even more greedy and unscrupulous, dividing their troops to advance westward, forcing our capital, and their intention is nothing more than to use their violence to force us into an alliance under the city, but they do not know that from the day our country decided to resist and defend ourselves, we have deeply known that this is the final moment. For the sake of the country's life, for the sake of the nation's personality, for the sake of international integrity and world peace, there is no room for surrender. All those with blood and spirit are determined to be jade fragments rather than tiles. The National Government is now moving to Chongqing today in order to adapt to the war situation, coordinate the overall situation, and engage in a more long-term battle on the largest scale." This was announced to the entire country. The defendant received higher education and had considerable status in various party and government circles, especially as the Minister of the CCP Propaganda Department at the time. Every word and action was enough to affect the views of China and foreign countries. However, he betrayed the central government with Wang Jingwei and others, organized the pseudo-government, and issued distorted remarks such as, "Resisting to the end, what is the end? Where is the end? If you don't want to talk about peace, then how is it different from saying that you want to resist until death?" (See the defendant's self-written "Memories and Prospects" article, published in "Peace, Anti-Communism, and Nation-Building Documents"), wanting to confuse the nation's hearing with his own inaccurate understanding, trying to reduce the anti-Japanese sentiment. For a time, people's hearts were shaken. If the central leadership had not been effective, the anti-Japanese camp would have almost collapsed. Now he still says that it was to test peace and did not hinder the anti-Japanese war. Is he deceiving himself or deceiving others? As for all the measures taken by the pseudo-government in the occupied areas, such as recruiting pseudo-soldiers, selling opium publicly, plundering materials, enslaving young people, using clearing the countryside as a pretext, and implementing blockades, none of them were not acts of harming the country and the people. He even said that it was to save the people and relieve suffering, which is completely reversing right and wrong. Furthermore, since the establishment of the pseudo-government, pseudo-soldiers have been trained, which not only consolidated the enemy's rear but also helped the enemy attack our defense lines, so that the enemy's flames became more intense and the invasion became deeper. The defendant's so-called shaking the enemy's military morale had the opposite effect. The facts are all there, and there is no room for sophistry.</p>
<p>The So-Called Self-Examination Does Not Conform to the Conditions and Facts</p>
<p>(2) According to the defense, the defendant once entrusted someone to surrender to the central government in the winter of the 31st year of the Republic of China (1942), providing military intelligence, establishing radio stations, deploying military affairs, assisting the National Army in counterattacks, rescuing central underground workers, and assisting the central government in developing party affairs and culture in the occupied areas. However, the defendant had already been wanted by the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office on November 4th of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939), and did not automatically surrender and be tried before the crime was discovered. Moreover, the regulations on traitors' surrender have stricter special conditions. Article 1 states that traitors who surrender before being discovered and meet one of the following conditions may be exempted from punishment or the execution of their punishment: (1) Reporting other traitor cases that have been confirmed by judgment or finding important evidence that is indeed valuable. (2) Exposing the dangerous schemes and strategies of traitors or spies that are indeed credible. (3) Secretly reporting enemy secrets that are indeed beneficial to our country. (4) Bringing weapons to offer. May I ask whether the defendant has any factual manifestations of one of the above four situations and can provide conclusive evidence? Moreover, according to the testimonies and written statements of various witnesses, the defendant had the intention to surrender in the winter of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941), but failed to reach the central government. The subsequent surrender was also proven by the Military Intelligence Bureau to have no such fact. Therefore, the defendant's so-called surrender is not only inconsistent with the conditions but also inconsistent with the facts, and can be ignored.</p>
<p>Preparing for a Counterattack is Even More of No Commendable Merit</p>
<p>As for rescuing underground workers, secretly reporting enemy information, contacting the National Army, cooperating with the Allied forces, preparing for a counterattack, and developing party affairs and culture in the occupied areas, according to the testimonies and written statements of various witnesses, it is also specious. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the defendant, either out of personal friendship or for other purposes, did occasionally lend a hand to rescue a small number of central underground workers, but over the years, countless underground workers have been captured and sacrificed by the enemy and puppets. In the areas of Nanjing and Shanghai, almost all of them have been wiped out. The number of people who have been rescued and can prove it is only a few. Weighing the pros and cons, what can be said about assisting the anti-Japanese war or benefiting the people? As the witness Ma Yuanfang said in his letter of proof, he did not dare to influence the country's public affairs with his personal private affairs. Furthermore, according to the letters from the headquarters of the First Security Column, the Second Security Column, and the Third Security Column, proving the close connection and secret consultation for the National Army's counterattack, regardless of whether it conforms to the case approved by the Supreme National Defense Committee that "personnel against traitors must be formally certified by the highest-level officers of each unit or special agent and commissioned in advance before approval is granted," the units themselves, due to the Japanese invaders' surrender, did not have the opportunity to counterattack and did not establish special merits, and the defendant is even more of no commendable merit. Furthermore, the Military Intelligence Bureau's reply and transfer documents also only stated that the defendant expressed his regret for his actions in order to rescue his mother and father-in-law Yang Zirong, who were both arrested and detained, and to leave a way out for the future. Since being approved for planning and use, he has been lukewarm and initially showed no results. After further planning and strengthening the use, he began to provide cover for underground workers and provide a small amount of funding. This is the same as the situation mentioned in the Army General Headquarters' reply that the defendant expressed his willingness to use the puppet army in the autumn of the 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944) to rebel at the right time and cooperate with the National Army's counterattack, which has been secretly reported to the central government. However, the area that the defendant was willing to support, the Allied forces have not yet landed, and the puppet army has not yet rebelled. The defendant has contact with the central government, but he has not assisted in the anti-Japanese war. It is impossible to use future facts as a basis for excusing guilt. It is very clear that the defendant saw the Allied forces winning victories one after another and the enemy's situation was dire, and only then did he have some contact with the personnel under the central government, but upon inspection of his later words and actions, he still did his best to resist the central government and slander the government, only showing his fence-sitting and double-dealing. As for party affairs and culture in the occupied areas, it is even more hateful. At that time, the pseudo-organization's efforts to handle party affairs and culture in order to absorb the masses were all in accordance with the enemy's will, cultivating enslaved young people and promoting enslaved education. How can it be considered a beneficial act for the people? The evidence submitted by the defendant, which he believes needs to be investigated, has been reviewed one by one and is not sufficient for reference in sentencing.</p>
<p>Issuing Counterfeit Currency, the People Suffered Considerable Losses</p>
<p>(3) According to the defense, the issuance of the pseudo-Central Reserve Notes was to resist the enemy's wanton issuance of military tickets, plunder of materials, and control of prices. It is unthinkable that the enemy's use of military tickets only extended to a small number of strongholds where the enemy troops were stationed and could not deeply affect the people or extract materials from the rear inland areas, and could not achieve the purpose of control and plunder. Therefore, the enemy instigated the pseudo-government to issue counterfeit currency and provide it in large quantities for its purposes. The defendant, with considerable knowledge, could not have been unaware of the advantages and disadvantages of this situation. However, the defendant and others intended to permanently seize the country's territory and overthrow the central government, and there was a need to manipulate finance. Therefore, under the circumstances of mutual use, the so-called national bank of the pseudo-government issued counterfeit currency, called it the New Legal Tender, and exchanged it for legal tender at a rate of two to one. At the same time, it promulgated regulations hindering the New Legal Tender, prohibiting the people from using legal tender, and severely punishing violators. On the one hand, it issued counterfeit currency without restriction, flooding the market, so that prices soared. The property of our people in the occupied areas was reduced by half for no reason, and they suffered considerable losses indirectly due to the impact of prices. From then on, the Japanese invaders were able to demand whatever they wanted from the pseudo-Central Reserve Bank. Although there were borrowing agreements in name, they not only had no intention of repaying the debt in their minds, but also did not recognize the qualifications of the creditor. In the beginning, our rear inland areas, because the enemy and puppets exchanged the legal tender they obtained at a rate of two to one and extracted materials from the inland areas, prices suddenly soared, financial turmoil ensued, and the necessary items decreased day by day. If it were not for the extraordinary situation, planning and deliberation, the people's public loyalty to the country, and the confidence in the victory of the anti-Japanese war, with one heart and one mind, responding appropriately, then they would not have succumbed to the military but would have failed in the economy. Thinking of it now, there are still regrets. (Ordinary shortsighted people still complain about the high prices, but they do not know that it is actually the poison of the Japanese invaders' plunder of materials and the pseudo-government's issuance of counterfeit currency.) This kind of evil deed is obvious to everyone. The defendant, even with the tongue of a reed, has no room for embellishment and evasion. What should be explained is that after the Japanese invaders had surrendered, the counterfeit currency was still issued in large quantities (according to the supply, the amount issued was 41 trillion yuan, which is inconsistent with the number published in the newspaper. In fact, it is definitely more than this number, and there is no way to calculate it now). All the personnel of the various organs in the area belonging to the pseudo-government were generally issued dissolution fees. For example, Wang Wenying was issued 40,000 yuan, and Ma Jiliang was issued 30 million yuan (both of which were supplied with volumes that can be verified). Even if it is converted at a rate of 200 to one, it is not a small number, which is probably not what ordinary small people can reach. If it is desired to increase the burden on the disaster-stricken people after the catastrophe, then those who presided over the issuance of counterfeit currency, such as the defendant, cannot but bear a major responsibility.</p>
<p>Joint Principal Offender, How Can There Be No Responsibility for Signing the Treaty?</p>
<p>(4) According to the defense, the defendant only participated in the signing of the treaty with the Japanese invaders and had no right to sign it. The declaration of war on Britain and the United States was all done by Wang Jingwei alone. At that time, he visited Pseudo-Manchukuo in the name of a pseudo-envoy, and the national flag was hung and the national anthem was sung everywhere he went, which was actually meritorious. How can it be said that he was flattering the enemy? The defendant, together with Mei Siping and others, taking Wang Jingwei as the center, jointly organized the pseudo-government and held important positions. They had a connection of intent and division of labor for all the treasonous acts issued by the pseudo-government, both internally and externally, and cannot but bear the responsibility of a joint principal offender. How can he claim that he only participated and had no right to sign it and stand aloof? How can he push the declaration of war on Britain and the United States onto Wang Jingwei alone? Moreover, the treaty with the Japanese invaders, declaring that they would live and die together, was enough to shake people's hearts. The declaration of war on the Allied nations of Britain and the United States isolated our central anti-Japanese camp, and it was undoubtedly an act of resisting his own country. As for the fact that Pseudo-Manchukuo was completely under the power of the Japanese invaders at that time, even if the masses occasionally saw the national flag and heard the national anthem, it would not help. The defendant's visit to Pseudo-Manchukuo was a clear performance of flattering the enemy, how can he be allowed to arbitrarily quibble?</p>
<p>Maintaining Public Order, the Central Government's Divine Plan and Wonderful Calculation</p>
<p>(5) According to the defense, after the victory, the defendant was appointed as the captain of the Shanghai Action Team,恪遵中央意旨, responsible for maintaining public order in Shanghai and along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, preventing traitors and puppets, and stabilizing people's hearts. When the National Army and the central receiving personnel arrived in Shanghai one after another, they handed over all the military police under their command to the central receiving personnel, which was not without merit. Regarding this point, according to the Military Intelligence Bureau's transfer documents and replies, it is indeed the truth. However, referring to the letters and telegrams from the late Director Dai submitted by the defendant, it can be seen that our supreme commander initially took into consideration the people in the occupied areas, who had been displaced for eight years, and were in great suffering, and could no longer tolerate unnecessary harassment at the time of victory, as well as to avoid other kinds of losses, so he had to have this expedient measure. This is a strategy of responding to the emergency and is also the painstaking effort of those who seek the country, and is by no means a pardon for heinous traitors. Therefore, the central government broadcast at the time that in all areas occupied by the enemy and puppets, the original enemy and puppet troops and officers must stay at their posts and maintain local order, not only in the Shanghai-Hangzhou area. Specifically, Commander-in-Chief He's published speech reported in the newspaper: "Although Zhou Fohai surrendered earlier, because of his important position in a certain organization, he has also been taken into custody," and the Military Intelligence Bureau's closure case official letter stated: "Upon investigation, Zhou Fohai, Ding Mocun, Luo Junzhang, Yang Xinghua, Ma Jiliang, and other five traitors were induced and arrested by this bureau in Shanghai on September 30th of last year. However, at that time, the National Army that received the surrender in Shanghai and Hangzhou had just arrived, traitors and bandits were surrounding, and people's hearts were fluctuating. If the two traitors Zhou and Ding were detained in Shanghai, it would affect the psychology of all the officers and soldiers of the pseudo-Tax Police Regiment controlled by Zhou and Ding, as well as the Shanghai and Hangzhou pseudo-Security Teams, the twelve regiments of the pseudo-12th Army, and the 132 divisions of the pseudo-Guard Army, and affect the public order of Shanghai and Hangzhou. Therefore, it was approved to send Zhou and Ding and other traitors to Chongqing for detention. Now all the major traitors in various places have been arrested, and a special envoy is assigned to escort Zhou Fohai and other five traitors, together with the original volume, and a letter is sent for your inspection and acceptance, and handling according to law." By observing and mutually verifying each of the above-mentioned statements, it can be seen even more how thoughtful and comprehensive the measures were at the beginning, and what the intention was. It is clearly revealed. However, the defendant was incorrigible, defied the law, and dared to claim in his answer that "the enemy and puppets surrendered, and for almost a month, no soldier of the central government arrived in Shanghai. During this period, it was not that no one persuaded the defendant to use Shanghai as a base to establish a new banner. If he had no choice, he could also plunder the wealth of Shanghai and take the troops to Jiangbei. To say it very presumptuously today, at that time, as long as the defendant said a word or nodded, the situation in the southeast would change," then his rebellious and unpredictable state is evident on paper. He even wanted to continue to ravage the local area after colluding with the enemy and trampling it for eight years. Here, we even more admire the central government's divine plan and wonderful calculation, anticipating things like a god, and finally making the most heinous criminals submit and be brought to justice, and his plan failed.</p>
<p>Abandoned by the People of the Country, He Actually Speaks Shamelessly</p>
<p>From this point of view, the defendant relies on his talent and is good at adapting, his words are insincere, he is fickle, and he is full of tricks. His claims of how he was willing to sincerely submit to the central government, assist the anti-Japanese war, help underground workers, establish radio stations, and provide intelligence are all untrustworthy. Also, the defendant said, "As long as I say a word or nod, the situation in the southeast will change." I don't know what he is referring to. Even if the Japanese troops in China still had a million troops, once they surrendered, they would have to obey orders and surrender their weapons. The army controlled by the defendant was only tens of thousands. Even if he had a plan, it would only be a temporary pleasure, and how could he permanently carve out a territory as a hero? Moreover, his subordinates' troops, not without those who deeply understand righteousness, may not be willing to be used by the defendant. If he is referring to something else, then brothers protect the walls to resist external insults, which is a clear teaching from ancient times. As for the defendant's selling out the country for personal gain, he has already been abandoned by the people of the country. No matter where he goes, south or north, to the barbarians or the Yue, no one will be willing to join hands with him. However, he speaks shamelessly, sows discord, and uses every trick he can. He is so inconsistent and fickle, and his words are deeply hateful. Therefore, after the victory, his maintaining local order and handing over all the military police were due to the general trend, and he had no choice but to do so. What merit can be said of it?</p>
<p>Difficult to Cover Up Major Transgressions, Do Not Conceal Great Guilt</p>
<p>Finally, it should be pointed out that the defendant speaks of political theory and then of legal theory, as if politics and law are two completely different paths. It is necessary to know that politics is to seek the welfare of the majority of people, and law is a reflection of politics. If you want to reform politics, you should use legal procedures and use the will of the majority of people to first amend the national law. You are not allowed to violate laws and regulations and establish another regime. If that were the case, why would various countries in the world have sanctions for political criminals (but according to international law, political criminals may refuse extradition), and why would there be provisions for the crime of internal rebellion in the criminal law? Because the defendant's daily remarks are absurd and chaotic, he is questioned and辩解d at the trial, fearing that the ordinary people cannot measure it, he has to be detailed in his accusations to dispel the doubts of the world and future generations. Since the Japanese invaders have been plotting to annex our country for a long time, from September 18th onwards, they have been gradually advancing, seizing our four northeastern provinces, sending troops to Inner Mongolia, invading Pingjin, and developing into the July 7th Incident. Our National Government could no longer bear it and rose up to resist and decided to be jade fragments rather than tiles and engage in a more protracted battle. All those with blood and spirit have the same hatred for the enemy. The defendant, however, was特達-ly known by the central government and repeatedly held important positions. During the war, he was responsible for the mission of propaganda, and his position was important. He should have worked together with one heart and reported to the country with all his loyalty. However, in the autumn of the enemy's deep invasion and the country's danger, he left the anti-Japanese camp, privately communicated with the enemy, willingly attached himself to the rebellion, betrayed the central government, and only sought to realize his personal political ambitions, regardless of the survival of the country and the nation. If the central government had not insisted on resisting to the end, and the supreme commander had not directed the right direction and had effective offensive and defensive plans, our country would have been陷於萬卻不復之地位 - pushed into a point of no return. To dare to take such risks is unforgivable by the law. Even if he has some minor merit, it is difficult to cover up major transgressions. Even if he has some small achievements, do not conceal great guilt. Weighing the severity, the sentence should not be lenient. He should be sentenced to the maximum penalty and deprived of public rights for life to extend the dignity of the national law and correct the people's vision. All property shall be confiscated except for the necessary living expenses for his family.</p>
<p>Based on the above arguments and conclusions, according to Article 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Ordinance, the preceding paragraph of Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 1, Article 2, Paragraph 1 of Article 1, Article 8, Paragraph 1, Article 9 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, the preceding paragraph of Article 2, Paragraph 1, Article 28, Article 37, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, judgment is rendered as stated in the main text.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Examining Our Nation's Constitution Through the Lens of the American Election</h3>
<p>The results of the American general election have reached China just as the National Assembly is preparing to convene as scheduled. According to repeated statements from government authorities, the primary purpose of this National Assembly is to formulate the fundamental law of the land, namely, the Constitution. It is truly regrettable that, 35 years after the founding of the Republic of China, we still do not have a Constitution. This is not to say that our country has been without a fundamental law. After the Nationalist Revolutionary Army eliminated the warlord and feudal forces in our country, we entered the period of political tutelage according to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. During this period, we had the Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage as the fundamental law of the land. The reason a formal constitution was not designated was that the period of political tutelage had not ended, and the reason the period of political tutelage had not ended was the invasion by Japan and the outbreak of full-scale war of resistance. Now that the Japanese invasion has been defeated and our country's war of resistance has been won, the formulation of our country's constitution has had to wait until after victory, hence the convening of the National Assembly to formulate a constitution. Before this, China was not without attempts to create a constitution, but under the circumstances of warlord separatism and the rampant resurgence of feudal forces, the formulation of a constitution seemed almost like child's play, so we saw constitutions being formulated and then immediately abandoned. This has continued for more than 30 years. Now that the National Assembly is about to convene as scheduled, and the results of the American election have just become known before the convening, the scrutiny of the American Constitution sparked by this election should serve as a reference for the National Assembly's constitution-making process.</p>
<p>The issue regarding the American Constitution raised by this American election is perhaps best exemplified by Senator Fulbright's suggestion that President Truman resign. His reasoning was that the Republican Party had gained a majority in both the House and Senate, and Truman should immediately appoint a Republican Senator as Secretary of State and resign from the presidency. At the same time, news reports indicate that British newspapers are discussing the separation of powers in American politics in complex terms, with an undertone filled with criticisms of this system as being outdated. This is indeed an issue worthy of attention and exploration. Senator Fulbright's remarks, at best, represent only personal opinions, but they contain extremely serious issues. This is that if an election can represent the public will of the people, then this American election has already indicated that the American people's inclination is toward the Republican Party and not the ruling Democratic Party. If the same situation occurred in Britain, the party in power would immediately step aside, and the party favored by the people would take power. Last year's British general election was precisely because the Labor Party gained a controlling majority in Parliament, forcing the highly respected Churchill and the Conservative Party he led to step down voluntarily, allowing the Labor Party, which had won the general election, to take power. This is the unwritten British constitution. However, in the United States, the Constitution, formulated under the influence of 18th-century political ideals, has a clear separation of powers; therefore, even if the results of this general election show that the people favor the Republican Party, President Truman still has two years left in his term, so the results of this election have not affected the reorganization of the government. President Truman and the Democratic Party he leads, even though they have lost the support of the people, can still remain in office for at least two more years. During these two years, with the Republican Party holding an absolute majority in Congress, President Truman, as the head of the executive branch belonging to a minority party, will inevitably face serious difficulties. The situation faced by President Wilson after World War I is unexpectedly being replayed today.</p>
<p>Therefore, the results of this American election should give our country's soon-to-be-formulated constitution a profound lesson. That is, first, we should not be bound by obsolete political ideals, but must break free from those outdated political ideals; second, we should cherish the legacy of our nation's early pioneers, and should formulate a fundamental law of the land that neither blindly follows foreign conventions nor fails to adapt to our country's national conditions, thus setting an example. The American Constitution, characterized by the checks and balances of the three branches of government, is not sufficient as a model, and the British system and the political systems of other countries may also not meet our country's needs. The emergence of the Soviet system in the Soviet Union has its historical background, and the emergence of the British system in Britain also has its historical factors. None of these are things that China can blindly follow. We must break free from these biases or preconceptions and formulate our own country's fundamental law.</p>
<p>Fortunately, our founding father Dr. Sun Yat-sen had already seen this point, and thus left the legacy of the Five-Power Constitution. This is truly a valuable legacy for us, free from the drawbacks of the separation of three powers and the evils of one-power dominance; the division of powers and functions is clear, and the system is carefully structured. How we should cherish this valuable legacy! Unfortunately, the people of our country have not yet cherished this valuable legacy. The "May 5th Draft Constitution" formulated by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the National Government is a manifestation of the ideals of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution, but the gentlemen of the Political Consultative Conference. This is truly regrettable. Of course, although the "May 5th Draft Constitution" has been repeatedly reviewed by the Legislative Yuan, considering thoroughness without seeking perfection, there may inevitably be some aspects that are not yet satisfactory; however, the spirit of the five powers and the theory of power and function must not be changed in the slightest. Now that the National Assembly is about to convene as scheduled, [unintelligible characters] may be able to avoid foreign conventions and fully express the spirit of our valuable legacy, in order to establish a foundation for the long-term peace and stability of the nation.</p>
<h3>American Domestic and Foreign Affairs After the General Election</h3>
<p>The election of members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives was held on the 5th of this month. Initial results from various states show that the Republican Party, which has been in the opposition for fourteen years, has actually defeated the Democratic Party and won a victory; not only is it sufficient to control both the Senate and the House, but the belief that it will win the 1948 presidential election has also been strengthened.</p>
<p>This victory of the Republican Party was indeed expected. President Truman's failure can be said to be the same as President Wilson's failure after World War I. The American people have been under the rule of the Democratic Party for fourteen years, and have long been weary of the Democratic Party's domestic and foreign policies and its consistent style; their hope for a change of ruling party has long existed, so this victory of the Republican Party is by no means accidental, and can be said to be opportune. Apart from this, there are also the following factors: (1) After the end of the war, the attention of the American people has shifted from abroad to domestic affairs; during the war, the focus was on military victory and diplomatic success; but after the war, the concern is with domestic reforms and economic recovery. The reason why the Labor Party was able to defeat the Conservative Party in the British general election last May was precisely because of this. The British people, having been under the rule of the Conservative Party for a long time, had long felt "enough," so they wanted the Labor Party to take power; similarly, the Chinese people, having been under the rule of the Democratic Party for a long time, had long felt "enough," so they wanted the Republican Party to take power. (2) Although President Truman also belongs to the Democratic Party, and has repeatedly stated that the policies he has adopted still follow the will of the late President Roosevelt; it is undeniable that President Truman has not been able to fully continue to implement Roosevelt's policies. For example, he abandoned price controls, causing prices in the United States to rise generally, and making life difficult for the general public, so demands for increased wages and labor strikes have emerged one after another. Therefore, President Truman has long lost the trust of the people, and this failure of the Democratic Party was also an inevitable result. (3) Repeated frictions in personnel relations have also weakened President Truman's domestic position and prestige. President Truman's discord with Congress has often caused disagreements between the White House and Congress. Although the President has repeatedly used his veto power, he has often lacked tact, causing rifts within the Democratic Party. At the same time, within the government itself, due to the issue of foreign policy, the former Secretary of Commerce Wallace actually disagreed with Secretary of State Byrnes. Although Wallace resigned, and Harriman succeeded him, after this uproar, the rifts within the American government became irreparable. This has also reduced President Truman's prestige.</p>
<p>After the opening of the 80th U.S. Congress, the Senate and House of Representatives will be completely under the control of the Republican Party; however, President Truman still has a full two years before the expiration of his term; during these two years, President Truman's implementation of any policy will be subject to congressional constraints. Especially in domestic affairs, the Republican Party has many dissatisfactions with President Truman's policies. For example: (1) the issue of maintaining compulsory military service; (2) the issue of merging the Army and Navy; (3) the issue of accelerating housing construction to solve the housing shortage; (4) the issue of fiscal balance; (5) the issue of price controls; (6) the issue of resolving labor strikes and unemployment; (7) the issue of reducing wartime high tax rates. Disputes between Congress and the government over the above issues will emerge one after another. How will President Truman handle himself in this environment? This is indeed a serious issue. As former President Hoover said: "In recent years, the entire world, including the United States, has been moving leftward on the road to economic omnipotence, but now the United States, after this general election, will be the first country to abandon this path." Former Secretary of Commerce Wallace also said: "A Congress dominated by the Republican Party will make American economic problems even more complex. The results of this general election mean that the Democratic Party cannot progress, and will be reduced."</p>
<p>In terms of foreign policy, the Republican Party's victory will not have a significant impact. Because the policies adopted by Secretary of State Byrnes are greatly influenced by Republican Senator Vandenberg, the U.S. delegation attends any international conference, whether it is the foreign ministers' meeting or the Paris Peace Conference, or even the United Nations General Assembly, Vandenberg Austria is under the direction of Vandenberg. Soviet newspapers or radio stations have recently criticized the current U.S. policy, accusing the Republican Party of being the new instigators of war. The attacks on Vandenberg himself are even more relentless. Therefore, French political figures, upon hearing the news of the Republican Party's victory, expressed anxiety, and wondered whether the U.S. attitude towards the Soviet Union would become more hardened. French leftists are also worried that the United States will be unwilling to provide economic assistance to European countries. These worries do not seem to be unfounded. At the same time, British diplomatic observers also say that Byrnes will continue to pursue the current foreign policy, in other words, on the one hand, the United States is unwilling to make concessions to the Soviet Union alone; on the other hand, the United States is unwilling to ignore the politics that occur within the Soviet sphere of influence. Therefore, it is expected that there will be no major changes in U.S. foreign policy in the future, and there may not be any immediate hope for an improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations. As the Soviet newspaper Red Star commented on the American general election: "There is little difference between the American Democratic Party and the Republican Party today. This can be seen in the tough stance adopted by the United States towards the Soviet Union. This election has added unlimited hope to the 1948 presidential election. As far as American politics are concerned, it is indeed a major change; however, in terms of its foreign policy, there is little impact. Because in today's United States, although there is a division between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, and each has different policies on domestic affairs; their opinions on foreign policy are completely consistent. President Truman has always respected the Republican Party's opinions in making decisions on foreign policy; therefore, in the future, Congress and the government may cause disputes over domestic affairs, but they will not cause differences over foreign policy.</p>

<p>How Difficult It Is to Be a Doctor and a Hospital</p>
<p>People throughout society seem to have very little understanding of the medical profession. Traditional thinking assumes that practicing medicine is a charitable undertaking. Doctors should not only diagnose illnesses for free, but also provide medicine. Only in this way does it conform to the principle of compassion. This was indeed the case in the days of our grandfathers and fathers, because doctors then were "needed" and "scholarly gentlemen" would occasionally prescribe a remedy to relatives and friends after reading the Treatise on Cold Damage and Miscellaneous Diseases and books of verified prescriptions – what could be better? When encountering a poor patient who couldn't afford to pay, it was no problem to take out their own pharmacy ledger and give away a few doses of medicine, because in the eyes of these "gentlemen," practicing medicine was, at most, only a "side business"—but things are very different now. A doctor from a formal school has to go through six years of elementary school, six years of middle school, and six years of university studies, examinations, and licensing. After working in a large hospital for at least four or five years, their experience and knowledge are combined, and they can practice medicine without endangering lives. It takes these twenty-odd years of cultivation and the expenditure of countless amounts of money from fathers and elder brothers before they can become independent. When they have a full beard, they need to start a family, they need to establish a career. To expect those who have no economic foundation to provide free consultations and medicine is beyond even Jesus' ability! They need to use gold bars to secure housing, they need to use currency units of ten thousand to support their families, if the income is not in the tens of thousands, how can they make ends meet?</p>
<p>As for friends with limited financial resources, there is no need to imitate the well-to-do and consult those private doctors. Public hospitals are established by the government, open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, day and night, waiting for patients to come. The registration fee is "at most" in the thousands. But how many people prefer to abandon the cheap for the expensive? It's hard to imagine. If you say public hospitals are not good, the most famous doctors all come from public hospitals. And now they may still hold part-time positions in public hospitals. But that's the way people are, what more can be said! When diagnosing illnesses, doctors are often asked, "Doctor, where is your office? How can I come to your clinic for a consultation next time?" This bad habit of "going through the back door" has become a national characteristic. It's as if diagnosing illnesses at a doctor's home is far more detailed than in a hospital. Not wanting to wait in line, wanting to jump the queue, wanting to use connections, this is the style of the rich, but even those without money want to follow suit, aren't they just asking for trouble!</p>
<p>It's strange that "honest people" are always more easily bullied. There are so many unscrupulous merchants speculating, thieves robbing, and other events that disrupt society, but the criticism of them is far less severe than a small incident involving a doctor or a hospital. Regardless of whether the truth of this small matter has been clarified, do you know that the police can simply go to the hospital to arrest nurses and doctors based on the patient's complaint? Do you know that people threaten to advertise in the newspaper to force the hospital to pay millions in "honorarium" as "compensation"? When the hospital announces that it is "full" and asks patients to seek treatment elsewhere, someone will criticize it for "failing to save those in distress," but when a refugee asks a store for a bowl of rice or a hostel for a place to stay and is cursed, who will speak up for them in the name of justice? There are only patients who get free hospitalization and reduced discharge fees, but there are no guests who get free meals and free accommodation? Unless they are "friends with accounts" who "eat from all directions"! Charity, charity, charity has ruined hospitals. No one is willing to charitably donate a sum of money for the hospital's operating expenses and set up free hospital beds, but there are calls everywhere for the hospital to squeeze out oil and do good deeds for free. From the tea boy to the doctor, the hospital has to give them a salary, which, although it can only be used as personal snacks and pocket money, the total amount is a huge expense. Since ancient times, I'm afraid there has never been an article that has called for hospitals and doctors: Please, philanthropists, let out an apartment to serve as a free dormitory for medical staff, please, laundries, do free laundry for the hospital's sheets and clothes, please, catering services, provide free meals for patients, please, pharmacies, provide free medicines for patients, please, large companies, donate a large number of sheets, clothing materials, to the hospital, please……… Yet they insist that the hospital admit patients for free.</p>
<p>Let's talk about doctors, please visit a hospital. Is their food nutritious enough? Is their dormitory even worse than a student's? How is their clothing? Can their salary, in addition to barely being able to support themselves, also make another new set of clothes, and raise a family? They are enduring hardships, working hard, year after year, for the future, but if you think about it for them, what is their future? You advise them to do business, yes, the doctors who really have money, their assets are probably not only from patients!</p>
<p>Speaking of patients, those who groan when they are not sick pay too much attention to advertising, want to get booster shots, want to take tonics, the more expensive the better. Doctors who charge gold bars or in U.S. dollars are the most appreciated. But those who are as poor as the doctors in public hospitals, also want to learn to be fashionable, do not pay attention to the training of their own physique, just want to rely on "makeup and rouge to paint the door", they are really asking for trouble.</p>
<p>While hating private doctors for charging high fees, I advise you to love and encourage the development of public hospitals. Let the doctors in public hospitals have enough to support their families, and give them an environment for academic research and exploration, then the people's enjoyment of free medical treatment will have a factual guarantee. Otherwise, there will not be a decent hospital in China, on the contrary, all will be seen as private doctors who are ripping people off. Don't you see that those big medical officials who shout the loudest for "public medical system" are now doing their private practice in silence?</p>

<p>Guiding Soldiers to Enjoy Training</p>
<p>I saw a column in the Readers' Opinions section of your newspaper on October 29 entitled "Please Officers Love Soldiers." I was a little incredulous after reading it. I couldn't believe that there were such unreasonable officers. I am fortunate that I can get a wise supervisor and enjoy the warmth of family love like parents and elder brothers.</p>
<p>I am a Private First Class in the Nanjing First Clothing Supply Depot of the United Logistics Command Headquarters. Since I enlisted, I have been trained by the squad leader every day. We started to feel it was very hard, but over time, we got used to it. Every morning, the chief officer leads all officers and soldiers in raising the flag and eating meals. A meal committee is organized by twenty-seven officers, who take turns purchasing food every day and then personally supervise the cooks in cooking. The officers and soldiers are treated equally with regard to food. If office supplies are to be purchased, the consumer cooperative makes the purchases. The empty space in the back garden is used as a farm to grow vegetables and flowers. The large courtyard in front is arranged as a Zhongshan Hall, which has a library, a chess area, a radio, a bulletin board, and a table tennis table. After meals and during leisure time, you can play games at will, so we don't want to go out to watch movies or visit the Confucius Temple. Every week, the chief officer leads a weekly meeting, and the section chiefs take turns giving speeches, so we understand the Three Principles of the People and how to love the country and the people. Our General Affairs Section Chief is a Beijinger, he manages us very strictly, does not allow us to go out casually, does not allow us to spend money indiscriminately. If we commit a mistake, we will be reprimanded or punished with kneeling or military discipline. We are very afraid of him, and everyone hates him a little, but he himself is very respectful to the warehouse chief, and does not have any private abuses in his work. We think he loves us very much, he is really like our strict father. As for our warehouse chief, he is a taciturn young man from Sichuan. His home is more than ten miles away from the warehouse, but he always arrives at the warehouse before 7 o'clock, and he walks. He has a dark face and wears very simple clothes, and he is kind from morning to night. He sits in the warehouse chief's office to do his work, never leaving, until after 6 pm before going home. He treats us like family, he is simply our kind mother, we really treat the warehouse as our home. If every officer can be like our officers, I don't think there will be any more notions of belittling soldiers. Everything I have reported above is not bragging to our officers, you can come and investigate on the spot. I hope that after the announcement, many officers with hearts of iron will see it, and let them know that they are ashamed, to see, to learn and improve. (Wu Guixian)</p>
<p>Another Tenant's Cry</p>
<p>I live in a front building of a store near Shanzhong Road. The second landlord of this house used to raise the rent once every three or four months. In February of this year, it had risen to 5,000 yuan. Electricity and water bills were still to be shared, but in September, the second landlord refused to accept the rent, claiming that the main landlord wanted to raise the rent. On November 1, the second landlord came and said that the rent would be raised five and a half times from August, a mere front building would cost 27,500 yuan, which is a shocking thing to hear. Arguing with him, he ignores it, and says that whatever the main landlord wants to add, he has to add. If you don't add it, you have to move. Is it true that the rent has to be raised every three or four months? Relying on the black heart of the second landlord to increase the rent, let him manipulate it and take heavy profits secretly, isn't there really any law to restrain it? The most oppressed are the salaried class, whose lives are barely enough to maintain, and the addition of snow on top of snow, heavy oppression, makes it hard to breathe. I hope that the relevant authorities will strictly prohibit the arbitrary increase of rent, and make regulations to inform them, so as not to encourage bad habits. (Wen Bin)</p>
<h3>Postal Substitute</h3>
<p>Gu Chun Jun: Regarding the matter you presented in your letter concerning conscription deferment, we have recently received a reply from the Jinshan County Government stating: "Upon investigation, this county received an order from the province on October 7th to allocate a conscription quota of 140 men, requiring half to be conscripted before October 15th and the entire quota to be filled by the end of the month. This concerns important matters of national defense and governance and must be strictly adhered to. However, considering the urgency of the deadline, we immediately convened a military service meeting with party, government, military, and group organizations, as well as the council. Following Item 9 of the fourth section of the provincial temporary conscription implementation methods, which stipulates drawing lots for examination by the districts, townships, and pao based on twice the allocated quota, it was decided that the conscripts in this county are generally weak in physique and many meet the conditions for exemption or deferment. With 343 pao in the entire county, collecting one person from each pao, selecting the weak and retaining the strong, and verifying exemption or deferment is a more efficient and fair method. The government implemented this proposal to further perfect all lottery procedures and the supervision and review of applications for exemption or deferment, thereby preventing the malpractice of township and pao chiefs being surrounded by favors and requests beforehand. Readers of your newspaper suspect that the changes in application procedures are due to changes in laws, which is a misunderstanding. Currently, 284 conscripts from various districts have been sent to the collection station. After open examination by party groups, the council, the health institute, and other organizations, 55 men were found to be physically unfit, and 79 men met the conditions for applying for exemption, all of whom were taken back by their original district chiefs in an orderly manner without any unexpected circumstances." Specially replied.</p>

<h3>Republicans Decide to Cooperate with Democrats; US Foreign Policy Remains Unchanged; Labor and Agriculture Policies to be Greatly Affected Domestically</h3>
<p>[Our News] San Francisco, 7th (Broadcast): President Truman believes that the results of this congressional election will not have a significant impact on the government's foreign policy, as this point is not a matter of contention between the two parties.</p>
<p>[Our News] San Francisco, 7th (Broadcast): Experienced political observers believe that when the Republican 80th Congress convenes in January next year, it will maintain and even strengthen MacArthur's position in Japan, Marshall's peace efforts in China, and adopt a firm stance towards the Soviet Union in Korea, China's Northeast Provinces, and Europe.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th (Special Dispatch)] Republican leaders here, after achieving an overwhelming victory in yesterday's national election, today assured that they will cooperate loyally with Truman and Democratic officials in the government on political affairs. The Republicans stated: Cooperation is a two-way street, and they expect Democrats managing political affairs to place the welfare of the country above partisan interests and follow the will of the people, as they expressed during the election.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 7th] Reece, Chairman of the Republican Central Committee, spoke about the party's foreign policy today, stating: When the next Republican Congress convenes, it will demonstrate to the world the determination of the United States to remain strong, but only if the Republicans can ensure the cooperation of the current Democratic government. The Republicans want to cooperate with other countries, but the party is determined to maintain America's traditions and defend its interests at all costs. In many parts of the world today, the freedom of most people is widely violated. At this time, the American people have turned to the Republican Party, which is truly liberal, and this is admirable.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, New York, 6th] Republican leader Vandenberg has been elected Senator for the fourth time in Michigan. It is said that the Republican victory is a sign of national support for a joint bipartisan foreign policy. From now on, the responsibilities of Republican senators are heavier and they must strive to fulfill them.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] With the Republican victory in the election, Senator Vandenberg is likely to become the Speaker of the Senate, succeeding the current Democratic Speaker, McCormack. The chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, currently held by Democratic Senator Connally, will also be taken over by Vandenberg. Many observers predict that Senate Majority Leader, Democratic Senator Barkley, will be replaced by Republican Senator Taft, who will also serve as Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. However, other observers believe that Taft would prefer to chair the Joint Committee.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] The Republican election victory will affect American labor and agricultural policies. According to Republican Congressman Martin of Massachusetts today, the Republicans will discuss more effective ways to restore harmonious relations between labor and management based on principles of absolute fairness. Martin, who may become Speaker of the House, has attracted attention from all sides of America. The Republicans have stated that they will vigorously oppose any control or subsidy measures and advocate for finding ways to expand the market. The party may introduce legislation related to expanding the market for agricultural crops.</p>
<p>Post-US Election Power Shift; Relationship with Soviet Union to Become Delicate</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 6th] Diplomats at the United Nations General Assembly believe that the Republican election victory could have at least three impacts on US foreign policy: (1) Vandenberg will be a key figure in the Four Foreign Ministers Conference and the US delegation to the United Nations General Assembly. (2) Although the current national foreign policy is a bipartisan policy of Democrats and Republicans, the Republicans, having an absolute majority in Congress, can do whatever they want with foreign policy measures, so it is difficult to predict how it will develop in the future. (3) The power shift in the United States will at least temporarily put US-Soviet relations in a delicate stage. A diplomat who once represented a Western country as an envoy to Moscow said today: "The results of this election in the United States do not seem to have much significance in Moscow. Since Vandenberg joined the US delegation to the United Nations, the Soviet Union has long understood that the United States only has one foreign policy, and it will proceed along a straight line thereafter."</p>
<p>Senator Fulbright Says Truman Should Resign Immediately</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 7th] President Truman, accompanied by his wife and daughter, refused to express his opinion on the election results to reporters while returning to Washington by special train from his hometown in Missouri, saying he would host reporters for a talk in a day or two.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 6th] Republican Senator Fulbright said after the Republican election victory that Truman should appoint a Republican as Secretary of State today, and he himself should resign as President. After Truman resigns, the Secretary of State will succeed to the presidency. He is not asking Truman to resign, but feels that this is the best thing for him. According to the US Constitution, if the President dies, the successors in order should be the Vice President, the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p>Reenactment of the Wilson Era; Congressional and White House Positions in Opposition</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 6th] Since the Republicans have greatly defeated the Democrats in the election battle, the US government is bound to undergo major changes. The Republican platform allows for a 2% reduction in individual income tax in the 1947 national budget, and government spending will be saved by one trillion dollars to balance the budget; the President's wartime powers will also be reduced, and the shortage of foods such as sugar will be investigated. The people of the country are bound to be happy to accept the Republican campaign promises regarding the control of goods. The votes obtained by the party swept from Massachusetts to California, and even the southern states, traditionally Democratic strongholds, were affected. The number of votes being checked in various places, obtained by the Republicans, is still increasing with time. When the new Congress convenes in January next year, it will be politically opposed to the White House, reenacting the situation during President Wilson's era after World War I; however, according to US political examples, the Republicans are expected to enter the White House in two years.</p>
<p>Have You Had Enough? The Republican Campaign Slogan</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 7th] The Republican victory in this election has gimmicks that the Democrats cannot match. The slogan revealed by the Republicans in various election districts is: "Have you had enough? Then vote Republican!" What the Republicans mean by "enough" is enough strikes, enough price increases, enough difficulty in supply, and especially enough threat from the Communists. Observers believe that the last point accounts for half of the Republican victory.</p>

<h3>Hoover and Wallace Each Issue Commentary</h3>
<p>Glimpses of British, French, and Soviet Opinion</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 6th] Former Republican President Hoover commented on the Republican victory, saying: The entire world, including the United States, has been leaning towards the path of leftist authoritarian economics for several years. After this election, the United States is the first country to rise up against this force. Former Secretary of Commerce Wallace said: A House of Representatives controlled by the Republicans will increase our country's economic problems, and progressive Americans will have to seek help from leaders of free thought. After this election, the Democratic Party must either become more progressive or declare its death. I sincerely do not want to see the Democratic Party die.</p>
<p>[Our News] London, 7th (Broadcast): The Soviet "Pravda" commented on the US Republican election victory, saying: The reactionaries in the United States are wasting the political capital painstakingly accumulated by President Roosevelt. This election particularly proves that the current US foreign policy is actually the foreign policy of the Republican Party.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 6th] Today, London newspapers all announced the results of the US election with large headlines, saying "The United States has leaned extremely to the right." French newspapers used headlines such as "Truman's opposition triumphs" and "The American people distrust Truman." The London Evening News said: The United States has dramatically turned to the right at a time when the world is leaning more to the left.</p>

<h3>Remaining Votes Irrelevant to the Overall Situation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 7th] The most complete election results this morning show that the Republicans have won 245 seats in the House of Representatives (218 seats are needed for a majority). Only three seats in Montana, New Mexico, and Utah have not been decided. A total of 23 Republican senators have been elected, occupying a total of 51 seats in the Senate (49 seats are needed for a majority). Three Senate seats in Maryland, West Virginia, and New Mexico have not been decided.</p>
<h3>Impact of General Election: New York Stocks Plummet</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 6th] Judging from the number of votes obtained by Republican leaders, the most promising candidates for the next presidential election are, in order, New York Governor Dewey, Ohio Senator Bricker, and California Governor Warren. Supporters of the Republican Party all believe that after this election, right-wing elements have been revived in a left-leaning world. The Truman government will form a more acute opposition to Congress than before, and the rise of the right will completely abolish various economic controls, restoring the "laissez-faire" era for large enterprises. Many important stocks on the New York stock market plummeted this morning.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ministers Conference: Italy and South Submit Statements</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 6th] South Korean Foreign Minister Simic and the Italian representative attended the Foreign Ministers Conference today to present their opinions on the Trieste issue. Simic made two limited concessions: (1) The eastern border line that South Korea can accept can be moved further east than originally agreed. (2) The requirement that the Governor of Trieste must be a South Korean national is revoked.</p>
<h3>Molotov Visits Washington Yesterday; Meets with President Truman; Plenary Session of the General Assembly Held Today</h3>
<p>[Our News] Paris, 7th (Emergency Broadcast, Washington News): Molotov will take the opportunity to attend the Soviet Embassy's reception commemorating the Revolution and meet with President Truman at 9 pm today. He will be accompanied to the White House by Deputy Secretary of State Acheson, and Soviet Ambassador Novikov will accompany Molotov.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 7th] The plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to be held at 4 pm tomorrow (midnight Shanghai time). The introductory ceremony for the three new member states of Sweden, Afghanistan, and Iceland is expected to be held at that time.

<h3>Soviet Revolution Commemoration: Grand Military Parade in Red Square; Stalin Does Not Attend Celebration Ceremony; Zhdanov Defends Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Moscow, 7th] Today is the 29th anniversary of the Soviet Union's National Day. A large-scale military parade was held in Red Square, with infantry, artillery units, tank units, and "Stalin" style giant tanks participating. A grand celebration ceremony was held at the Moscow Grand Theater last night, but Head of State Stalin did not attend.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 7th] Soviet radio broadcast the celebration, but did not specify whether Stalin was present to participate in the celebration. The London Times speculated today that Stalin "may be following the doctor's advice" and not giving a speech.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] Moscow Radio said: At a meeting of the Moscow Soviet today, Zhdanov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Zhdanov is regarded as Stalin's successor), attended and delivered a speech defending the Soviet Union's foreign policy and accusing Britain and the United States of preventing the implementation of peace plans. He said that the Soviet Union, the center of the world's democratic forces, has become the target of a propaganda offensive by those who make war a profitable business and fear the growth of democratic forces. One of the Soviet Union's goals is to establish a strong United Nations organization to prevent aggression and maintain peace. The Soviet Union is constantly striving to establish a strong, lasting, and reasonable democratic peace. Zhdanov first mentioned the domestic situation in his speech, saying that the Soviet Union remained strong after the war, and the Soviet Union was probably the only country where no crisis occurred after the war.</p>

Stalin ordered all Soviet troops to learn military technology. Although the hand order was issued by Minister of Defense Stalin, it was signed by Deputy Minister Bulganin.</p>
<h3>US Decides to Retain Administrative Rights Over Pacific Islands; Plans to Submit Draft Trusteeship Agreement to Security Council for Discussion</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] President Truman announced today that the United States is prepared to transfer all of the former Japanese territories and its mandated islands that the United States now controls to the United Nations for trusteeship, and the United States only needs to retain its administrative rights. The United States has also drafted "Strategic Area" trusteeship agreements for the Marshall, Caroline, and Mariana Islands, which can be submitted to the United Nations Security Council for discussion. These draft agreements have also been sent to the other ten members of the Security Council and New Zealand and the Philippines for research. As for the islands that originally belonged to Japan but were not mandated by the League of Nations, the United States does not seem to have drafted trusteeship agreements yet. These islands include the Ogasawara Islands, the Volcano Islands, and the Ryukyu Peninsula, but the President's statement implies that they should also be drafted in the future. Government officials familiar with the United Nations Charter call the phrase "Strategic Area" the key to the President's statement. According to the United Nations Charter, all matters related to trusteeship of strategic areas should be handled by the Security Council, while non-strategic areas are handled by the United Nations Trusteeship Council.</p>
<p>Full Text of the Agreement Draft</p>
<p>[US News Agency, Washington, 6th] The State Department today issued a draft of the trusteeship agreement for the Japanese mandated islands. The draft agreement quotes the provisions of the United Nations Charter, stipulating the establishment of an international trusteeship system to manage and supervise certain territories, including territories under the current mandated system of various countries. The draft also states that the League of Nations Council on December 17, 1920, charged Japan with mandating the former German islands north of the equator, and as a result of World War II, Japan has ceased to exercise any powers over these islands. Therefore, after the United Nations Security Council believes that there is no incompatibility with the relevant provisions of the Charter, it decides to pass the following trusteeship conditions for these Pacific islands:</p>
<p>(Article 1) Stipulates that these islands are designated as strategically important areas and placed under the United Nations trusteeship system. The draft agreement refers to the area as the trusteeship territory thereafter. (Article 2) The United States "is designated as the administrative management office of the trusteeship territory." (Article 3) The United States' administrative, legislative, and jurisdictional powers over the trusteeship territory are restricted by the provisions of the agreement. (Article 4) The administrative management office must abide by the principles of the United Nations trusteeship system. (Article 5) The administrative management office must protect the trusteeship territory and contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security in accordance with the United Nations Charter. In order to achieve this goal, the administrative management office may (a) build naval, land, and air bases and build fortresses in the trusteeship territory, (b) verify the tie-up and mobilize armed forces in the territory, and (c) use volunteers, equipment, and assistance in the trusteeship territory in order to not only maintain the local defense, law, and order in the trusteeship territory, but also perform the obligations of the administrative management office to the Security Council. (Article 6) Explains how the administrative management office fulfills its obligations under Article 76 (b) of the United Nations Charter, including: promoting the development of residents in the territory towards autonomy, promoting the economic progress and self-sufficiency of residents, and promoting their social and cultural progress. (Article 7) Stipulates guarantees for the following freedoms for residents: freedom of speech, press, assembly, conscience, worship, religion, education, and immigration and migration. (Article 8) The administrative management office shall guarantee equal treatment for all member countries of the United Nations and their people in the areas of judicial administration and negotiating commercial treaties and other agreements within its mandated territory. Section 3 of this article states, "The provisions of this article shall not be interpreted as such for the issue of aviation rights for aircraft entering and leaving the trusteeship area. This right is a matter for the authorities in charge of the trusteeship area to subscribe to an agreement with the country to which the aircraft belongs." (Article 10) Allows the administrative management authority to participate in any regional advisory committee, regional authority, or technical organization or other national self-established association, and also allows it to participate in the specified international organizations. (Article 11) Stipulates that the United States should take steps to determine the nationality status of residents of the trusteeship land. (Article 12) The United States shall establish a law to implement this agreement within the trusteeship territory. (Article 13) Articles 87 and 88 of the United Nations Charter apply to the trusteeship land. (Article 14) The administrative management office shall abide by the provisions of any appropriate international conference and recommendations within the trusteeship land. (Article 15) Prohibits the unauthorized alteration, modification, or abolition of the provisions of the agreement without the consent of the United States. (Article 16) This agreement will take effect after completing the procedure specified in the Charter and being approved by the Security Council and the US government.</p>

<p>Yesterday, 268 bookstores in this city, including Commercial Press, Chung Hwa Book Co., Zhengzhong, World, Da Dong, Kaiming, Children's Bookstore, Yongxiang, Guangyi, Wentong, Guangming, Shenghuo, Writers', Longmen, Baixin, Jinzhang, and Huiwentang, gathered at the Book Industry Association and unanimously agreed that the book industry is a cultural undertaking closely related to the nation's destiny and the survival of the people, and should be strongly supported by the government. Previously, in September of this year, the city council publicly resolved at its first general meeting to exempt the book industry from business tax, intending to revitalize culture after the war and provide support. However, this resolution to exempt the book industry from business tax must be approved by the Ministry of Finance to take effect. Now, more than a month has passed, and there is still no clear written statement from the Ministry of Finance, which has caused deep consternation. Accordingly, it was publicly recommended that representative Guo Nongshan, Wang Jiugu, Fan Xiren, Shen Jixiang, Lu Shizhong, Xu Xiaoyun, Yao Pengzi, Xu Boxin, Liu Jikang, Song Liangrui, Zhang Shimin, Xu Shaohe, Li Changsheng, Zhou Xihe, Wang Zhicheng, Jiang Zhenzhan, and Wang Qiuquan, a total of seventeen people, together with Li Bojia, chairman of the Book Industry Association, take a China National Aviation Corporation flight to Beijing at 8 am today to petition, personally presenting the details to the Ministry of Finance, requesting prompt approval of the city council resolution, permanently exempting the book industry from business tax, in order to implement the state's intention to support culture and thereby increase the efficiency of universal education.</p>
<p>Another report: The Shanghai book industry delegation will travel to Beijing this time to personally submit a petition to Minister Yu Hongjun of the Ministry of Finance, stating various reasons, requesting permanent exemption from business tax for the book industry, and will also petition President Song of the Executive Yuan, Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education, and Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, so that the case of exempting the book industry from business tax, which is related to the future of the nation and its culture, is of great importance, and should be given strong support.</p>

<h3>Shandong Refugees Urgently Need Relief: Minister Gu Discusses the Disaster Situation at the Shandong Fellow Villagers Welcome Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shandong Province Refugee Relief Association held a grand welcome meeting at the Shandong Fellow Villagers Association on Luban Road at 3 p.m. yesterday to welcome Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang, and to urge Minister Gu to report on the inspection of the disaster area in Shandong and relief measures, as well as to promote relief for the disaster in Shandong. The heads of various agencies in the city were invited to participate, including Kong Xiangxi, Gu Zhenggang, Qin Dechun, Zhang Jingyu, Xuan Tiewu, Wang Guanqing, and more than 200 members of the fellow villagers association. The meeting was chaired by Qin Dechun, Vice President of the Association. Mr. Qin first expressed his welcome to Minister Gu, and then expressed his gratitude to Mr. Gu for providing practical and effective relief to the disaster victims in Shandong Province after inspecting the disaster situation in Shandong Province in mid-August. At the same time, he asked the heads of various agencies and leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai to assist in launching relief efforts for the disaster in Shandong. Minister Gu then reported on the inspection of the disaster area in Shandong and the relief methods, briefly stating: "I will do my best to cooperate with everyone to find ways to launch practical relief work for the Shandong refugees who are still in deep water and fire." The Shandong relief and rehabilitation affairs were originally handled by the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. In August, the Central Government ordered me to inspect Shandong, and I went to Qingdao, Jinan, Zhoucun, Zichuan, Boshan and other places. There are about 3 million people who need relief. According to the report of the Shandong-Qingdao Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, 1.2 million people are in need of relief, and they were originally farmers, workers, and educated youth with assets or means of production. Now they have all become refugees and urgently need relief. Most of the students in Jinan eat coarse steamed buns, salted radishes, and plain boiled water. They are ragged and barefoot everywhere. Farmers and workers are forced to leave peaceful places, which is even more miserable. This is all due to the devastation of the enemy during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and the actions of the Communist Party in the past year. After the inspection, I reported the actual situation to the Central Government, and at the same time, I had several thoughts: (1) The Shandong refugees have suffered all kinds of hardships and are in great pain. I extend my greatest sympathy to them. (2) The spirit of hard work and perseverance of the Shandong compatriots is worthy of admiration. (3) The land in Shandong is fertile and rich in products. It was the base of the Anti-Japanese War in the past, and it will be the base of national construction in the future. "The Shandong authorities proposed that the Central Government allocate 2 billion yuan in relief funds. After the Central Government approved 1 billion yuan, it also made several decisions: (1) Small loans of 500 million yuan. (2) Agricultural loans of 1 billion yuan. (3) Industrial loans are being negotiated. (4) 500,000 sets of winter clothing. (5) 3,000 to 4,000 tons of flour, with each refugee receiving about one bag of flour. The government has done its best to allocate such relief funds and materials in the midst of financial difficulties. Recently, the Central Government will conduct a second relief effort. The emergency relief in the pacification zone will be handled by the Ministry of Social Affairs. 300 counties in the pacification zone have been occupied, and 120 counties have been recovered. About 2 million people are in urgent need of relief. The Central Government plans to allocate 9 billion yuan, plus 20,000 tons of flour. Each county will receive about 50 million yuan in relief funds and 8,000 bags of flour, plus 500,000 sets of clothing and 500,000 catties of food____ to be distributed in a coordinated manner. In addition, the Farmers Bank will also provide small loans. The Central Government also subsidizes the local administrative expenses in the recovered areas, setting it at 600,000 yuan per county per month to reduce the burden on the people. I will soon go to various parts of the north to inspect, convey the intentions of the Central Government, and comfort the refugees." Finally, Mr. Gu asked all sectors to launch a disaster relief campaign, help each other, and promote the great spirit of the Chinese nation. Then, Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu delivered a speech, praising the contributions of Shandong generals Wang Yaowu, Li Yannian, and the late General Zhang Zizhong to the country during the Anti-Japanese War. He expressed his willingness to participate in promoting relief for the disaster in Shandong. Then, Mayor Wu's representative Wang Guanqing delivered a speech, expressing his willingness to call for disaster relief. Later, Central Committee member Kong Xiangxi delivered a speech, urging people in Shanghai to save money from eating meat to help the disaster in Shandong, so that the Shandong refugees in deep water and fire can eat some miscellaneous grains. At the same time, he asked the Shandong Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai to take the lead in donating as an initiative. Finally, the disaster relief methods were discussed, and it was first decided to raise relief funds ranging from 500 million to 1 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>A Beautiful Moon and Blooming Flowers: Chrysanthemum Exhibition to be Held at Fuxing Park Starting Today</h3>
<p>[Special Feature from Our Newspaper] "Picking chrysanthemums under the eastern fence, I leisurely see the southern mountains." Tao Yuanming's obsession with chrysanthemums in ancient times was originally a good story in history. But for two thousand years, how could Tao Yuanming be the only one in the country who loves chrysanthemums? As the saying goes, "Even when the chrysanthemums are gone, there are still proud frost-resistant branches," how many people have yearned for the noble character of chrysanthemums!</p>
<p>Following the Huang Garden Chrysanthemum Exhibition, the Garden and Field Management Office of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works will hold a large-scale chrysanthemum exhibition at Fuxing Park starting today. The chrysanthemums displayed in the park, large and small, in various shapes and colors, number no less than 3,000 pots. Stepping into the gate of Fuxing Park, a myriad of colorful flowers will immediately dazzle you and be a feast for the eyes.</p>
<p>Entering from the gate on Huailong Road, the first thing that catches your eye is the large lawn with the two characters "菊展" (Chrysanthemum Exhibition) written on it. The characters are in a straight font, made up of snow-blue tiny chrysanthemums called "Baby's Breath".</p>
<p>The Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth</p>
<p>Turning your gaze from the two characters "菊展" to the left, the national emblem of the "Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth" appears before you. This three-dimensional national emblem is also composed of tiny chrysanthemums called "Baby's Breath". It is eighteen feet high. The top of the highest conical layer, the "White Sun," is made of white chrysanthemums, and the twelve "corners" distributed around it are also composed of small white chrysanthemums. The bottom layer is the "Wholly Red Earth," which is composed of dozens of pots of red chrysanthemums. With a large expanse of green grass as a foil, what a beautiful emblem of the motherland with the "Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth"! It is said that these ingenious masterpieces were all designed by horticultural expert Mr. Cheng Shifu.</p>
<p>The Panda Still Looking Spirited: Feet on the Green Grass, Red Carrot in Mouth</p>
<p>In addition, it is quite interesting to see the remains of the panda group displayed in a glass cage. Its feet are on the green grass, and it has a red carrot in its mouth. Its snow-white fur has turned yellow because it has been frozen below zero degrees for too long. The eyes are still so bright, shining brightly at every visiting tourist. Is it a look of arrogance? Or a full of anger?</p>
<p>In addition to the more than 1,000 pots of chrysanthemums carefully cultivated by various nurseries, there are also participants from various local areas, such as Huang Garden, Xian Garden, Nanyang Seed Company, Xiangshun Company, Guo Yongping, Xue Haonan, Gao Lianshi, etc., totaling more than 30 units. There are more than 1,000 pots of various types of chrysanthemums. The names alone, which are rich in poetic meaning, are already a feast for the eyes. Such as "Guifei Drunk," "Chang'e Flying to the Moon," "Golden Hook Supporting the Moon," "Ice Plate Holding Cinnamon," "Golden Xi Bamboo," "The Former Dynasty Remains"...</p>
<p>According to Xu Tianxi, Director of the Garden and Field Management Office, and Cheng Shifu, a horticultural expert: foreigners and Chinese have different standards for loving chrysanthemums. European and American countries like to use chrysanthemums for flower arrangements and planting in flower beds, and rarely grow them in pots. Therefore, they only pay attention to the flowers, diameter, and color. As a result, they often like the tiny chrysanthemums called "Baby's Breath" of Japanese origin. However, the Chinese appreciate chrysanthemums for their graceful posture, the dancing of delicate petals, or for their unusual colors, such as soy sauce color, green, and dark purple, which are all considered to be precious.</p>
<p>The responsible persons in the Garden and Field Management Office have worked hard for three days and three nights, and finally added a touch of beauty to this ugly world. - Do you say that you do not love flowers? Do you have no special affection for high-class chrysanthemums? I advise you to go to the chrysanthemum exhibition for a visit! Discovering a little beauty in this ugly world is also a touch of comfort in the midst of a hundred sorrows!</p>
<h3>Mayor Inspects Labor District: Residents of Yaoshui Lane and Yinghua Lane in District Thirteen are Mixed, and Criminals Regard it as a Refuge</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Mayor Wu, accompanied by Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, inspected Districts Twelve and Thirteen at 8 a.m. yesterday, inquiring in detail about the summary tables of household registration and the movement registers, and diligently asking about the increase and decrease of the population. He did not return to the city government until 9:30 a.m.</p>
<p>According to Mayor Wu, he hopes to revisit the districts in the near future. Next time, he may visit the Xincheng District and the Huangpu District. He will personally inspect places with dense populations and cramped conditions so that he can learn about the real situation of life at the lower levels.</p>
<p>After the mayor left, the reporter further inquired about the general situation of the two districts. Both districts are labor districts with special circumstances, which are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>District Twelve Raises Funds for School: May Reach 300 Million Yuan</p>
<p>(1) The head of District Twelve is Hou __ren, and the deputy head is Lü Xingcheng. The office is located in the Gordon Road Police Sub-bureau and at No. 12 Zhonghua Xincun, Xinzha Road, the former residence of Zhou Nigang Jun. The district has 51 bao (neighborhoods), 36,000 households, and 210,000 people, including approximately 120,000 men and 90,000 women. The district is actively carrying out the establishment of national education classes, and 40 classes have been established, with 80 people in each class. The fundraising for the ____ school has also been promoted, and it is estimated that 150 million to 300 million yuan can be raised (mostly from donations from factory owners). The biggest problem currently facing the district is the lack of a fixed office location. Therefore, during the mayor's inspection, a petition was submitted, stating: "The office and staff dormitories of this office do not yet have a fixed address, and the staff are running around, which has a great impact on their work. It has been found that a building at No. 40 Sanyuanfang, Xinzha Road, the residence of the traitor Zhang Guisheng, has been sealed up by the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau. It is requested to be temporarily allocated."</p>
<p>Out-of-School Children Account for 60%</p>
<p>(2) The head of District Thirteen is Zheng Meikui. The district has 34 bao (neighborhoods), 833 tian (fields), and a population of 131,775 people, including 73,132 men and 58,273 women. The district also has water-based baojia (neighborhood security system). The number of out-of-school children reaches 60%. National literacy classes are currently being promoted, and 300 million yuan has been raised for school celebrations. Once a school site is found, a central primary school will be planned. There is another thing worth mentioning: the area of Yaoshui Lane and Yinghua Lane in the district has a mixed population, and those who have committed crimes see it as a refuge. Therefore, it was known as "Little Liangshan" in the past. However, after rectification, it has changed its old appearance. It is said that most of the residents of the two districts are workers. Although they can obtain ____ cooperation when promoting district work, the rate of ____ is inevitably slow due to the low level of knowledge.</p>

<h3>Three Russian Criminals Arrested for Specializing in Stealing Jeeps: Stole Vehicles Parked on the Roadside and Sold Them Near the Grand Guangming Theater</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper) Recently, auto theft cases have occurred frequently in the city. Although the police authorities have repeatedly arrested thieves and brought them to justice, they have not been able to completely eliminate them.

He caught sight of a U.S. ambulance parked on the side of the road. Seeing that no one was around, they drove it away together. After driving to Hongqiao Road, the vehicle broke down and could not be driven, so it was abandoned on the side of the road. The vehicle was later recovered by the U.S. military authorities. He claimed that this was due to being drunk and not intentional theft. (2) One month ago, he met his friend Paivalov on the road. The latter said that there was an American woman who wanted to buy a Jeep. A few days later, he introduced the American woman, Mike, to him. They met at the Didi Si Cafe on Linsen Middle Road.

The latter asked him to sell another Jeep and promised to meet again at Didi Si in three days. After meeting, they agreed to deliver the goods near the Grand Guangming Theater that night. When he arrived at the scene, he met a Russian named Xiyeaifu, who gave him 200 U.S. dollars. He had just stolen a vehicle from the entrance of the Arcadia Nightclub and handed it over to Xiyeaifu to drive away. The two Jeeps were one for the U.S. Army and one for the U.S. Navy, etc. According to the confession, the original investigator went to the address to arrest Paivalov and Xiyelov, etc., who have all admitted to selling the stolen goods.

<h3>No One Has Applied to Register for the Second Round of Auctions of Houses in Various Alleys</h3>
<p>Who Wants to Make Trouble for Themselves in This Day and Age?</p>
<p>Since the Central Trust Bureau announced the second round of auctions for 333 real estate properties, all tenants in the Weihai Villa on Weihaiwei Road, the Daxingli in Wusong Road, and the Gongheli in Changzhi Road, which were listed for auction, have published advertisements unanimously opposing the auction and demanding the protection of the legal tenants' right to continue leasing. According to Article 425 of the Civil Code: "After the lessor delivers the leased property, even if he transfers the ownership to a third party, the lease contract continues to exist for the transferee." However, Item 11 in the Central Trust Bureau's "Instructions for Voting on the Auction of Enemy and Puppet Real Estate" stipulates: "All enemy and puppet houses that have been auctioned must be vacated within two days after signing the preliminary agreement and handed over to the successful bidder for takeover on the day of the transaction. If the vacation is delayed, the successful bidder may apply in writing to cancel the preliminary agreement, and the Bureau will return the deposit and pay interest at a monthly rate of one cent per deposit amount." Thus, it seems that regardless of whether the lease contract is valid or not, the original residents of the houses being auctioned will be forced to move out within twenty days, causing tens of thousands of citizens to suffer the pain of displacement. Therefore, this reporter visited Chen Hanqing, the assistant manager of the Real Estate Department of the Central Trust Bureau, to inquire about the handling of the aforementioned real estate auction. According to him, 18 units have registered with the Trust Bureau since the second auction began, but most of the houses applied for purchase are single-family homes. No one has applied to register for the houses in various alleys that published advertisements in the newspapers opposing the auction. Chen admitted that the provisions in Item 11 of the "Instructions for Bidding" were too broad. The Bureau has decided to recognize the legal lease rights acquired before the victory and whose lease terms have not yet expired, and will not apply Item 11. However, according to Chen, except for the tenants of Weihai Villa, most of whom have legal lease rights, most of the households in the alleys in the Hongkou district that are being auctioned do not have legal lease relationships. As for how the original residents will be forced to vacate after the houses are auctioned, it will be handled by the Disposal Bureau, which is beyond the authority of the Central Trust Bureau. This reporter then visited Shen Guanqi, the Secretary-General of the Disposal Bureau, who said: "The Disposal Bureau's auction of houses must not conflict with the Civil Code, but for residents who have not obtained legal lease relationships or whose lease terms have expired, after the real estate is sold, the Disposal Bureau will ask the military camp agencies in the city to assist in ordering them to move out. For entire alleys such as Weihai Villa, several houses without lease rights must be vacated for the purchaser to live in, and the rest will still be subleased to the original residents with lease contracts, so the purchaser should not have any objections."</p>
<h3>Two Traitors in Changshu Relied on Enemy Power to Oppress the Villagers. Li Jianci and Gui Zhen Were Tried Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The High Court yesterday heard several cases of suspected treason: (1) Li Jianci and Gui Zhen were reported after the victory. After investigation by the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police and the Changshu County Government, it was confirmed that Li had served as a liaison officer for the puppet Changshu County Government and a translator for the enemy military police. He often used the power of the enemy to go to the countryside to collect military grain and extort rice and other items. On July 26, 1938, he led enemy military police to Xixiang Bridge to kill and burn with machine guns. The Chenghuang Temple and other places were destroyed, and many people were killed and injured. In addition, he colluded with the enemy military police to capture anti-Japanese elements. Gui Zhen served as an intelligence officer in the puppet Changshu County Special Operations Station and as a member of the Special High Group of the puppet Changshu County Police Bureau, working with Li Jianci. In court yesterday, Li admitted that he knew a little Japanese, but only served as a liaison officer in the General Affairs Section of the puppet Changshu County Government, and only indirectly helped the enemy purchase food, denying everything else. Gui claimed that it was a case of mistaken identity, not the defendant, but admitted that he had indeed served as a member of the Special High Group of the Police Bureau, but claimed that he had joined under the order of the National Salvation Army to cover up the provision of information.</p>
<p>Zhang Awu and Chen Lingeng</p>
<p>(2) Zhang Awu and Chen Lingeng, who were engaged in barge transportation, transported materials for the Xie Xing Foreign Firm and the Donghe Foreign Firm, which were run by the enemy navy on the Huangpu River during the enemy and puppet period. On the morning of August 10, 1943, villagers Ge Xingmin and Zhang Zhiliang purchased dozens of kilograms of rice from Pudong and crossed the river to Shanghai's Gongping Road for sale. Just as they reached the center of the river, they were suddenly ordered to stop by a small enemy fire transport. Zhang Awu and Chen Lingeng forcibly dragged Ge and Zhang to the transport, falsely accusing them of stealing military supplies. They were escorted to the enemy military police team and subjected to torture, and detained for 29 days before being interrogated and released. After the victory, the victims reported them. The two defendants denied the charges in court yesterday.</p>
<p>Wu Wenquan</p>
<p>(3) Wu Wenquan was accused of serving in the puppet Special Operations Headquarters No. 76 during the 30th year of the Republic of China, and later serving as a secret agent for the Penglai Road branch of the enemy Shanghai Military Police, using his power to extort money from merchants. After the victory, he was reported by others. After questioning in all the above cases, all were adjourned for further questioning.</p>
<p>White Russian</p>
<p>Moulton Lehof, has lived in Shanghai for eleven years. He is 44 years old and served as the secretary of the Shanghai White Russian Friendship Association. After the victory, he was accused of serving as an intelligence officer at the enemy military department's radio station on Jing'an Temple Road. The case has been heard several times, and the defendant has denied the charges. The debate concluded during the hearing yesterday morning, and the verdict is scheduled to be announced at 9:30 a.m. on the 14th of this month. The case of Sun Renmao, a construction worker accused of building roads for the enemy, is also scheduled to be announced on the same day.</p>

<h3>Too Many River Police, Unclear Authority, Merchants Suffer, Not Knowing What to Do</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to people in the import and export industry, the situation of theft at the wharves in the city has improved slightly since the authorities have repeatedly rectified it. However, the police force on the river surface is still too thin. It is now heard that various parties are launching the organization of a voluntary water police force to supplement the police force. This organization can be realized in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>It is also said that the division of authority between the port police and the water police on the river surface is quite problematic. The case has been discussed many times by the Shanghai Port Affairs Reorganization Committee, but no solution has been reached. The merchants are even more at a loss. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>The congestion of ships in the port has not been as serious as before recently. This is because the US seamen's strike has not been resolved, so there are very few US ships arriving. The situation in various docks has also become more relaxed.</p>

<h3>The Mission of Taiwan Company's Ships: Repatriating Japanese Nationals Remaining in Taiwan, Transporting Taiwanese Compatriots from Nanyang Back, and Simultaneously Carrying Passengers and Cargo to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In addition to the ships of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Minsheng Company, the Taiwan Shipping Company also operates the Taipei and Tainan ships between Shanghai and Taiwan. According to Shen Huating, the head of the preparatory office of the company's Shanghai office, these two ships were Japanese ships salvaged and received after the victory, each with more than 8,000 tons. The biggest task at present is to transport Taiwanese compatriots from Nanyang back and repatriate Japanese nationals remaining in Taiwan. The former are laborers who were forcibly conscripted by the Japanese during the war, numbering about 40,000. They are now being transported back to Taiwan in batches by the Taipei ship. There are still more than 20,000 Japanese nationals waiting to be repatriated, who are being transported by the Tainan ship. At the same time, they are also carrying ballast cargo to Shanghai, so the route is triangular: first from Keelung to Sasebo, and after the Japanese nationals disembark, they sail to Shanghai to unload the cargo; then they load cargo and passengers from Shanghai back to Keelung. Each round trip takes about 20 days, and each trip can carry about 300 passengers. The ticket price is in accordance with the regulations of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. As for the company's other received ships, they are all small motorized sailing ships that can only sail on the island of Taiwan. New ships have now been ordered from the United States, and four of them will be delivered soon, the largest of which is about 2,000 tons.</p>
<h3>Chairman of the National Art Association Zhang Daofan Came to Shanghai to Recuperate, Hoping to Have a Few Days of Peace and Quiet Without Seeing Guests</h3>
<p>Central Committee Member Zhang Daofan arrived in Shanghai by express train from Beijing at 8:00 a.m. yesterday. Zhang's wife and sons and daughters came with him. Zhang's visit was purely for recuperation, so he will not be receiving guests in Shanghai for the time being. However, he will attend the welcome reception for Qi Baishi, which will be held by the literary and art circles in the city.</p>
<p>Answering Reporter's Questions</p>
<p>[Another Report] Zhang Daofan, Chairman of the China National Art Association, who recently became a student of Qi Baishi, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing at 8:00 a.m. yesterday. At the North Railway Station, Zhang supported his wife with his right hand and carried his beloved daughter Lilian out of the car with his left hand. He had a few minutes of conversation with reporters when leaving the station. Zhang said first: "I came to Shanghai this time entirely hoping to get a few days of quiet rest, and there are no other tasks, so I have no opinions to express." The reporter asked: "Where does Mr. Zhang live?" He answered: "Please forgive me, I don't want to disclose where I am staying this time. I am someone who likes friends. If it is disclosed, friends will come to see me, and I can't not see them, otherwise they will misunderstand that I am putting on official airs." The reporter asked again: "Then, Mr. Qi Baishi, your new teacher, is now in Shanghai. Aren't you going to see him?" He answered: "Because Teacher Qi will be returning to Beiping in three or five days, I will of course go to visit him and say goodbye to him." The reporter also said: "I heard that all circles in Shanghai will have a grand welcome party to welcome your teacher and Mr. Pu Xinyu. Can you go to that welcome party?" He answered: "I don't know what day this welcome party is. If my spirit is slightly recovered by then, I will definitely go. Otherwise, I would be too disrespectful to my teacher." The reporter asked again: "I heard that Mr. Jiang allowed you to become a student of Mr. Qi. Is that right?" He said: "Chairman Jiang, because he values this 86-year-old master of the art world, once took the time to meet him. He will naturally not object to my becoming a student of Mr. Qi." "I heard that you gave a report of more than two hours on the night of the ceremony of becoming a student, which has not yet been published. Can you publish the manuscript so that everyone knows why you are 50 years old and still want to become a student?" "Because I have been too excited recently and my spirit is not good, the report manuscript has not yet been整理. If you must have it after it is 정리, I can publish it." "Mr. Zhang, I heard that when you became a student, you sent your teacher some inexpensive but very interesting local products from your hometown. So, what did your teacher give you as a souvenir?" "My teacher said that when he returns to Beiping, he will paint a few pictures that he thinks are satisfactory and send them to me." At this point, he had already walked out of the station and got into the car with those who had come to meet him.</p>

<h3>Social Service: Tuberculosis is Becoming More Rampant One Year After the Victory (Part 1)</h3>
<p>More than a year has passed in an instant since the victory. Shanghai, which has always been regarded as a tuberculosis city, has not been able to improve the lives of ordinary citizens, so it is still a good target for tuberculosis attacks. The number of people affected is more than in any previous period. This is not only a terrible shadow on the lives of millions of citizens in Shanghai, but also reflects how significant the impact on the health of the entire nation is. What is the extent of the recent rampant tuberculosis in the city? According to the X-ray examination statistics report of 3,224 people in the first half of this year at the Hongqiao Sanatorium:</p>

<h3>The Central Bank Vigorously Sells at High Prices, Gold Prices Forced to Turn Back, Over 4,000 Bars Sold</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Central Bank struggled with speculators, with prices initially rising and then falling. The morning opened at 2.46 million. Silver shops and securities firms showed unwavering buying interest, and the price rose above 2.48 million. The Central Bank vigorously sold at high prices, showing a strong selling intention. Before long, the wind changed direction, and because the allocation time was near, buyers temporarily adopted a wait-and-see attitude. In an instant, the price plummeted to below 2.385 million before stabilizing. After recovering to 2.4 million, the Central Bank allocated 115 bars at a price of 2.4025 million, with brisk sales. Wealthy individuals and securities speculators all came to inquire. Near noon, the price recovered to 2.46 million, struggling at around 2.455 million at noon. In the afternoon, next-day delivery initially held firm but then weakened. The Central Bank continued to sell vigorously, with a total of over 4,000 bars sold throughout the day. In the end, the price was suppressed to 2.41 million, a drop of 45,000 from the previous close. Gold ornaments were at 56,000, silver rose to 3,400, silver dollars slightly decreased, dark interest rates remained unchanged, and interest rates remained around 1.5 fen.</p>
<p>Foreign currency lacked a speculative atmosphere. US dollars showed no signs of improvement, with the dark market price at a low of 4,100 yuan and a high not exceeding 4,180 yuan. The noon price was below 4,150 yuan, similar to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were also lackluster, with a slight decrease of 5 yuan. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were around 870 yuan, Indian exchange rates were 1,055 yuan, and British exchange rates were 14,100 yuan, still with supply exceeding demand and very few transactions. The official exchange rate for US dollars remained unchanged, but there were no direct trades.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds: Flat and Weak, Unified Bonds to be Drawn Again</h3>
<p>Government bonds remained stable yesterday. Unified Bonds C opened in the morning at 1,270 yuan. With some selling from Fuyuan and others, the price fell to 1,130 yuan, but then buyers provided some support, and the price rose to 1,280 yuan mid-day, struggling around 1,250 yuan afterwards.

<h3>Textile Construction Cloth Up 1,000 Yuan, Yarn Prices Down Slightly by 10,000 to 20,000</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the yarn market lacked the strength to rise. Special Double Horse initially shouted a high of 2.3 million in the morning, but there were no buyers, and no transactions were made. For other 20-count yarn, due to the Textile Control Committee's decision to prohibit the black market from the 11th of this month, the industry stopped buying and observed the situation. Sentiment turned soft, and sellers were quite active, but there were few buyers. Medium and small 20-count yarn fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. There were some transactions for 20-count cone yarn, with prices based on the allocated price plus profit.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market unanimously improved, and sales were more active than before. Textile construction cloth prices for all grades also increased by about 1,000 yuan. Many people went to apply for allocation. Yesterday's market prices: fine cloth at 81,750 yuan, Blue Chicken at 79,000 yuan, Yang He at 75,000 yuan, Four Gentlemen drill old goods at 94,000 yuan, Four Gentlemen printed white at 91,000 yuan, and warehouse receipt goods traded at 89,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cloth Price Review Committee: Retains Cost Calculation</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Cotton Cloth Review Committee held its third regular meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday in the conference room of the Social Affairs Bureau. Attendees included Director Gu of the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhu Shangyi of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Wu Shufang and Chen Jiazhen of the Textile Construction Company, Wu Shuying and Yan Guangdi of the Cotton Textile Industry Association of the Sixth District, Lu Runjin of the Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, and Jiu Feng and Bei Zairong of the Cotton Cloth Industry Association. Director Yuan first reported on the minutes of the previous meeting. Then, the discussion of cloth costs began, using the cost calculation tables for various grades of goods submitted by the dyeing and weaving industry as data, which were reviewed and revised individually. However, the current cloth market has fallen below the actual cost, so it was decided that the cost calculation figures would be temporarily retained by the Social Affairs Bureau. It was decided that Wu Shuying of the Cotton Textile Industry Association of the Sixth District would explain that the current market cloth prices are indeed insufficient to cover costs. To achieve balance, it is hoped that the authorities will adopt effective measures for flower allocation as soon as possible, so that raw material costs can be reduced, and yarn prices can also be reduced again. If yarn prices can be reduced again, cloth prices will not only be sufficient to cover costs but can also continue to be suppressed. Otherwise, cloth factories are in a very dangerous situation. Finally, Director Gu said that from now on, any illegal black markets that exceed the price limits should strictly abide by the methods set by the government, and judicial organs should severely punish them to ensure complete elimination.</p>
<h3>Silk Sales Were Dull</h3>
<p>Yesterday, rayon saw a slight increase again. Because there were actual sales, manufacturers were procuring from the black market, which aroused desires for profit. No boxes of 120-count old-packaging Tianqiao bright goods were traded; only two or three boxes of new-packaging goods were traded. In the morning, they traded for 3.17 million to 3.2 million yuan; in the afternoon, they traded for 3.2 million to 3.3 million yuan, slightly more lively than the previous day, trading for 40,000 to 50,000 yuan more. Yesterday, 120-count semi-pioneering also shouted a price increase of 50,000 yuan. Factory operations were sluggish. Market prices were stable without change. Transactions were extremely dull. Silk goods were also hovering on a path of weakness, mainly because the weather was too warm and business in retail stores was slow. Local sales markets were limited, and procurement by wholesalers was also rare, leading to this situation.</p>
<h3>Although Raw Peanuts and Soybeans Fell, Oil Prices Have Not Yet Returned to Normal</h3>
<p>Over 10,000 dan of various goods arrived in the north and south rice markets, but digestion remained slow. Medium and low-grade northern and southern japonica rice continued to weaken by 1,000 yuan. Yang Xian and Bu Xian rice showed slight softening, and Du Xian and Ke Xian rice decreased by 300 to 500 yuan. Limited high prices, white yuan sales remain sluggish. Flour arrivals and sales were both scarce, with no temporary relief. Wheat was sluggish, continuing to fall by 300 to 500 yuan. Although soybean sources were scarce, sales were unsatisfactory, falling by 1,000 yuan. Sesame seeds rose slightly by 1,000 yuan. Qingdao shipments of raw peanuts alone surged, while Nanyang shipments were unresolved. The local market outlook was pessimistic, and it entered a weakened state again. High-grade goods fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, and medium-grade goods plummeted by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. The arrival of soybeans from the Northeast increased, with supply exceeding demand, gradually falling, and the outlook was not optimistic. The oil market lacked raw oil and soybean oil, and there were no formal market prices. Only refined oil was traded, with prices rising by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Sesame oil also continued to rise.</p>
<h3>China Vegetable Oil Factory Allocates Edible Oil, Deadline for Payment Within Three Days</h3>
<p>The China Vegetable Oil Factory allocates edible oil at 200 barrels per day. On the 7th, the allocation was changed to 200 barrels of pure raw oil, priced at 99,000 yuan per dan. It is reported that oil merchants often do not pick up the edible oil allocated by China Vegetable Oil Factory. Outsiders mistakenly believe that they cannot allocate enough. In fact, the factory allocates according to the number requested by each oil merchant every day. In view of this situation, the factory has decided to change the allocation method. For the allocation of edible oil, if payment is not made and goods are not picked up within three days, their oil allocation qualification will be canceled, and it will be re-allocated to qualified retail stores that have applied.</p>
<h3>Stabilizing the Black Market for US Dollars: Rely on Exchange Settlement Documents for Delivery</h3>
<p>According to people in the export industry, currently, for export goods, it is necessary to apply to the Central Bank or Chase Bank for a certificate proving the foreign exchange amount for the goods has been collected by the bank or credited to the bank's account. Only then can customs allow export based on the bank's certificate. This method can be considered meticulous. However, for import goods, this is not the case. Therefore, every time foreign shipments arrive, US dollars are searched for, and the black market rises. If customs also required the original exchange settlement documents from the settling bank before allowing the delivery of import goods, the agitation in the black market for US dollars would be greatly eased.</p>
<h3>Tea Exports from Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 6th] The Allied Supreme Commander today ordered the Japanese government procurement agency to extract one million pounds of tea from its tea reserves and hand it over to the Japan Tea Export Company for export purposes.</p>
<h3>Lowering Daily Interest Rates in the Banking and Money Industry: Reducing Overdue Interest to 1.5 Fen Per Month</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance is very determined to suppress interest rates. It has telegraphed the Central Bank to lower lending interest rates as much as possible when approving them to alleviate the people's difficulties. National opinion also believes that the high interest rates are one of the reasons for the decline of industry and commerce. It has been learned that the Municipal Money Industry Association will reduce the daily interest rate for overdue payments by 5 jiao starting today, that is, from 5.5 yuan to 5 yuan per day per thousand yuan, calculating to a monthly interest rate of 1.5 fen. The daily interest rate for inter-industry loans is 3.3 yuan per day per thousand yuan. The daily interest rate for deposits remains at 6 jiao per thousand. Bank interest rates are traditionally negotiated by the money industry and jointly reported by the banking and money industries to the Central Bank for approval. Therefore, the banking and money industries will reduce the daily interest rate starting today.</p>
<h3>Sparse Sugar Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was weak, continuing to see downward movement. The association quoted spot prices for medium white sugar grade 20 at 132,000 yuan, raw sugar at 112,000 yuan, coarse white sugar grade 24 at 177,000 yuan, and 100-pound Peruvian white sugar at 160,000 yuan.

However, purchasing applications from the trade were unprecedentedly desolate, totaling less than 10,000 bags. Quoted Taiwanese ordinary sheet ice sugar at 145,000 yuan, Xinghua white at 122,000 yuan, Xing red at 114,000 yuan to 108,000 yuan, Diao Qing at 112,500 yuan to 111,000 yuan, totaling two to three hundred pieces traded.</p>
<h3>Profits Tax: Second Review Meeting Held Yesterday, Tax Payment Notices Issued to Over a Hundred Associations, Additional Levies for Those Who Fail to Report on Time</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Municipal Direct Tax Bureau convened a review meeting at the Jinmen Hotel yesterday to expedite the collection of profits tax for the past year. Director Wang Fuzhou made a special trip from Beijing to attend. Review committee members and representatives from the Chamber of Commerce who attended included Du Yuesheng, Xu Jiluo, Cha Liangjian, Wang Xiaolai (represented by Ge Futian), Xi Yushu, Pan Shihao, and others. From the Tax Bureau, Director Lou, Assistant Ge, Section Chief Wang, and others accompanied Director Wang. Regarding all the report forms previously transferred by the Chamber of Commerce, the bureau presented statistics, stating that taxing at 150% of the originally reported profit amount would yield a tax revenue of over 19.2 billion, which still deviated from the original budget. It was also stated that tax payment notices had been issued to over a hundred associations, and no accounts would be audited. The remaining portions were being reviewed in succession and would be completed shortly. Director Wang also clarified that taxing at 50% of profits was in accordance with the simplified collection method for profits tax promulgated by the Ministry, and he hoped that the Chamber of Commerce would relay this to the various trade associations to avoid misunderstandings. The Chamber of Commerce continued to collect declaration forms, and as of the 5th of this month, a total of over one thousand households had been collected, with profits of over 36 million yuan, which the Chamber of Commerce representatives submitted to the Tax Bureau on the spot. It was also decided to tax based on the average standard capital profit rate of each industry and no further audits would be conducted. However, the minimum limit should not be less than 150% of profits. Those who failed to report on time would not be granted extensions and would be determined separately by the Tax Bureau. The collection standard would be stricter than those who had already reported. For those whose industry was known, it was decided to tax according to the average standard capital profit rate of the industry, plus an additional 20%. For those whose industry was unclear, it was decided to tax by referring to a similar industry or by adding a certain percentage to the city's average standard capital profit rate. At the meeting, the representatives expressed regret that tax-paying units had not fully reported. It was heard that the four major department stores had also not reported. After the meeting, a certain gentleman told others that the simplified collection of profits tax was not limited to within the profit amount. However, it was hoped that the Tax Bureau would not take harassing actions to alleviate the difficulties of businesses.</p>
<h3>Two Articles of the Securities Exchange Business Rules Amended</h3>
<p>Articles 66 and 67 of the Provisional Business Rules of the Securities Exchange have recently been submitted to the Ministries of Finance and Economics for approval and amendment. The full text of the amendments is as follows:</p>
<p>Article 66: Brokers shall pay a security deposit to this exchange, which will be transferred to the Central Bank. This exchange may order brokers to pay a transaction evidence deposit, which will be collected by this exchange and deposited in the Central Bank.</p>
<p>Article 67: Broker security deposits shall be divided into bond and stock categories according to Article 4, with each category set at 50 million yuan. 40% of this must be paid in cash, and the remaining 60% can be used in lieu with valuable securities or real estate, but real estate cannot exceed 30%. The substitute price of valuable securities or real estate shall be formulated by this exchange and submitted for approval and public announcement. If the price of the aforementioned valuable securities or real estate falls by 20%, the broker shall, after receiving a notice from this exchange, replenish the substitutes to this exchange each time as required and transfer them to the Central Bank. When the price returns to the original price, this exchange shall notify and return them separately.</p>
<h3>This Year's Cotton Production Estimated at Approximately 7.9 Million Dan, Average Yield of Only 24 Jin Per Mu</h3>
<p>The Cotton Production Improvement Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Joint Association of the Republic of China Machine Cotton Textile Industry Association, following the precedent of the annual cotton production survey report held by the former China Cotton Mill Owners Association, separately dispatched personnel to cotton-producing provinces to conduct on-site surveys of the cotton production situation in the 35th year. Based on the surveyor's report, the first estimate was released. This estimate was compiled based on the survey reports from twelve cotton-producing provinces, including Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan. However, the situation in Shandong Province was special. The surveyor dispatched by this association returned from Qingdao, and the numbers listed were provided by Mr. Hu Pingchu of the Shandong Provincial Department of Construction, as requested by the North China Cotton Production Improvement Office. For Shanxi Province, in addition to the personnel dispatched by this association for investigation, the Central China Cotton Production Improvement Office also requested the Shanxi Provincial Department of Construction to handle it. Also, for the twelve cotton-producing counties in Hunan Province, as of November 5th, only four county reports had been received. Repeated telegrams were sent urging them, but the surveyor had not yet replied. Therefore, the numbers listed are only a portion and will be revised in the second release.</p>
<p>This year's survey was delayed due to preparations, and transportation in various places was also obstructed. The estimate report was generally based on the cotton situation before October 25th. The units of measurement are all municipal units.</p>
<p>This year's cotton production has made great progress compared to last year, but it is still far from the 26th year. This may be due to the widespread war, the lack of food, cotton farmers' unwillingness to plant cotton, and the high production costs due to transportation obstacles. The production and sales sides have not embarked on a prosperous path, and irregular rainfall is also a reason. As for pest damage, the losses are relatively small. This estimate includes a total of 32,418,169 mu of cotton fields, producing 7,895,610 dan of lint cotton, with an average of 24 jin of lint cotton produced per mu.</p>
<h3>Free Remittances for Family Support: Four Banks Agreed on Measures</h3>
<p>The Four Banks Joint Treasury held its 327th board meeting on the morning of the 7th of this month, with Minister Yu Hongjun acting as chairman. Over thirty cases of local escrow, loans, and export documentary credits were approved, and measures for remittances of family support expenses by personnel serving in public and private institutions were passed. The original text is excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>(1) For personnel serving in public and private institutions whose family members are not with them at their duty station and need to remit their salary income for support, if the service institution proves and applies for the remittance, this method shall be followed. (2) For the first remittance application, the service institution shall verify and prepare a complete list, affixing the official seal for certification, and submit it to the local branch of the Four Banks for review and distribution, and notify each bank to accept the remittance. For subsequent monthly applications, the remitter should truthfully submit an application directly to the original remitting bank. If there is no branch of the Four Banks in the local area, each bank should consult with each other and handle it in accordance with this method. (3) The remittance amount is limited to 100,000 national currency, but with proof from the service institution, it can be negotiated according to half of the applicant's total monthly salary income. (4) Each person is limited to one remittance per month. (5) This remittance is free of remittance fees. (6) This method will be implemented after being passed by the board of directors of the Four Banks Joint Treasury and reported to the Ministry of Finance for record.</p>

<h3>Another Estimate of Tobacco Leaf Production</h3>
<p>This newspaper published on the 30th of last month that China's tobacco production ranks second in the world. Now, according to a reader's letter from the Millard's Review, China's tobacco production is estimated to be third in the world, not second. The United States produces the most tobacco in the world, followed by India, and then China. According to the statistics of 1937, mainland China produced 150 million pounds of tobacco, the Northeast produced 100 million pounds, and Taiwan produced 15 million pounds. This is recorded here for reference.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Cannot Recover, Bearish Sentiment Forces People, Broker Number 164 Grounded</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks continued to be unable to recover in a situation of demoralization yesterday. The banking sector, such as Xingye, Jiaotong, Zhongnan, and Tongshang, tried to maintain them, but the sellers took full advantage and were always succumbed to the sellers' momentum. When the morning opened, the stocks were still flat. Number 164 was banned from entering the market, and people were hit, feeling extremely pessimistic. Even if someone commissioned Traffic Bank Number 31 to supplement Number 164's purchase of 85,000 Xinyi shares and 2,000 American Asia shares, the selling was like a tidal wave. After opening, it showed a one-sided decline. After ten o'clock, numbers 89 and others made supplementary purchases, causing a slight reaction, but the market showed rampant short-selling. Although the power of those who shorted was not strong, the momentum forced the market to be suppressed. Although there were twists and turns due to constant absorption by the banking sector, almost all stocks ended at low prices near noon, except for Qinxing. Compared with the previous closing, popular stocks like Yong Yarn, Jingfu, Xinguang, Qinxing, and American Asia each fell by half a percent to one percent, while Leng Jing alone fell by nearly 20%, and the rest also fell by half a percent to one percent. The weakness continued slightly in the afternoon. The 600-yuan mark of Yong Yarn was soon broken. After 2:30 PM, it was the weakest, but numbers 168 and 169 came to buy at low prices, and gradually recovered after the low. Xinguang suddenly rebounded by more than ten yuan under the purchase of Traffic Bank Number 31, standing out alone. The rest still did not escape the consolidation. Compared with the previous closing, popular stocks like Yong Yarn, American West, and Jingfu fell by 8 to 9 percent, Xinyi fell by over 10 percent, and Qinxing only fell by slightly less than half a percent. Cold stocks Datong, Match, Yonggong, Jinglun, and Underwear each fell by over 10 percent, Huaxing slightly rose, and the rest all fell. Stocks outside the market also continued to decline.</p>
<p>The stable trend of foreign stocks was still difficult to maintain. Many popular stocks were still liquidated and retreated again. Yeguang, Gangye, and Huidong Paper were relatively cold and could still be supported. As a result, except for the aforementioned four types, all fell by about half a percent.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Approves Three Measures for Issuing Public Expenses</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The Ministry of Education recently approved three measures for issuing public expenses: (1) Approved veterans who have retired from the Youth Army will continue to receive the original public expenses according to the regulations of the Youth Enlistment Preference Method. However, those who have not been approved for public expenses also have the same request. In order to take care of the studies of youth enlisted students, all youth enlisted returning students who have been approved for discharge by the part concerned will be granted full public expenses (tuition, accommodation, and meal expenses are waived; other expenses are not included). Those who have not been approved by the part concerned are not included. (2) Loyal youth or students who have escaped from the communist areas, whose families are trapped in the communist areas and whose economic sources have been cut off, and who have been thoroughly investigated and found to be true, and who have obtained reliable certificates sufficient to prove their status, will be granted public expenses. (3) The temporary supplementary classes of Lin Da are all limited to end in July. The original two types of relief funds, A and B, should be cancelled uniformly. These students, even if they have been assigned by the ministry, are no different from the new students recruited by various schools. The granting of their public expenses should still be in accordance with the prescribed public expense method, and public expenses should be approved separately within the prescribed clauses.</p>
<h3>Japan Announces Three-Year Plan to Rebuild 4,000 Schools</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Education Spokesperson on Overseas Study Policy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Recently, several newspapers have discussed the policy regarding studying abroad, with varying opinions on whether it should be lenient or strict. A reporter visited the Ministry of Education to inquire, and according to the spokesperson of the ministry: It is a good phenomenon that people in society are concerned about education. The Ministry of Education has always been very cautious about the policy on studying abroad and is also very open to considering social discourse. During the eight years of the war, European and American academic fields advanced rapidly. The situation of rapid progress is far beyond what we can imagine. To catch up with the times, we must start from two aspects. On one hand, we should actively enrich the equipment of our universities to seek a fundamental solution. On the other hand, we should also select promising young talents to study abroad to avoid falling behind. As for cultivating university faculty, we must also plan for this in advance. However, if there are no restrictions, the children of wealthy people can freely go abroad, which will inevitably lead to abuses. This can be stated definitively. The admission standards for self-funded students this year are slightly broader than those for publicly funded students, but stricter than the previous year's self-funded student examination. In terms of numbers, only 800 people applied in the previous year, while 3,817 people applied this year. The students who have been admitted have only obtained the qualification to go abroad. If they do not have admission documents from foreign universities, they will still not be allowed to go abroad. The amount of foreign exchange is also limited, and it will never be allowed to exceed actual needs, to prevent abuses. As for the management after going abroad and the employment issues after returning to the country, the Ministry of Education has a comprehensive plan. In terms of management, the embassy is currently responsible, and in the future, it is planned to establish cultural specialists to handle it. Returning students will be recommended to relevant agencies by the Ministry of Education. This method has been implemented effectively. Last year, more than 50 students who returned from studying in Europe were mostly employed through the recommendation of the Ministry of Education. In the future, when society is stable and construction is underway, more talents will be needed, and the phenomenon of students being idle and unemployed can be gradually eliminated. In short, the Ministry's implementation of the overseas study policy is considering the overall plan for national and ethnic construction. The society's concern for this matter and the suggestions put forward are most welcome and will be carefully considered by the Ministry.</p>

<h3>Mayor's Cup Small Ball Re-Decision, Unreasonable Audience Cause Disturbance on the Field, Longjie Jianxing Unfinished Game, Chaos and Fighting Occurred One Minute Before the End</h3>
<p>In the first Mayor's Cup small ball game, Longjie and Jianxing played their third final at 3:30 pm yesterday. More than 2,000 spectators watched at the Jinyuan Park Stadium. As a result of the game, Longjie took the lead with a score of 2-0 in the first half. After changing sides, the competition between the two sides became more intense. Two minutes before the end of the game, some illegal spectators broke into the field for no reason, causing the game to be unable to finish, which is a pity. At 3:30 pm, referee Wang Chongye blew the whistle to start the game. Longjie first launched an offensive. At 15 minutes, Longjie Jin Lusheng tricked Qu Shuifu, and a wonderful pass to the center, Zhao Yongfang rushed out to shoot. Tao Ziming lost his defense, and Longjie took the lead with a score of 1-0. At 25 minutes, Jin Lusheng made contributions on his own, 2-0 Jianxing fell behind again. Before long, the first half ended. After a break, the two armies did not move. Jianxing counterattacked, and the battle was fierce. Until before the end of the game, there were still two minutes left. When the referee awarded a free kick, some unreasonable spectators on the west side of the stadium rushed into the field, hindering the progress of the game, and the order was suddenly disrupted. At that time, in addition to Longjie Zhuyuan Jin Lusheng being seriously injured in the attack, sports reporters from various newspapers were also accidentally beaten. A spectator named Li Guangshun was violently attacked by thugs, his face covered in blood. When the armed military police heard the news and arrived at the scene, the chaotic situation gradually cleared up. The lineup of both sides in yesterday's game is recorded later:</p>
<p>Longjie: Sheng Peter, Zhou Yongfang, Lin Shaojun, Gao Xiuqing, Jin Lusheng, Zhao Yongfang, Yu Zhenyue.</p>
<p>Jianxing: Tao Ziming, Xu Guohuo, Qu Yongfu, Tao Tingfu, Luo Shoufu, Gu Yiche, Chen Mingzhe.</p>

<h3>Stepping into the Hometown of Guan Zhong</h3>
<p>—Mei Gong</p>
<p>Yingshang, October 27th</p>
<p>The first impression of Yingshang, the hometown of Guan Zhong, a great politician in ancient China, to those who come here for the first time is: ancient, remote, dilapidated, and dry.</p>
<p>From Zhengyangguan Husha River sixty miles, to Xinhekou to land, and a little more than one mile west, you arrive at Yingshang County. Entering the east city gate, the first thing you see is the Kui Xing Pavilion, which is half-empty on the north side of the road. The four big characters on the pavilion are "Civilization of the World". The windows of the pavilion are open, and there are several female students of eighteen or nine years old working in the pavilion - not doing needlework, but reading books. Below the pavilion is an arched doorway. Not far to the east through the doorway, is the largest hotel in Yingshang County - the Social Service Office. The rooms are not bad, but the prices for food and drink are not very expensive.</p>
<p>Toilet on the City Wall</p>
<p>Yingshang City is circular and very small, with a circumference of just over one mile. You can walk around the city in a short time. The city wall is made of brick and is no more than a Zhang high, because part of it was removed from the top during the Anti-Japanese War. I climbed the city from the east gate and walked along the top of the city to the north gate. Looking at the autumn wilderness outside the city and the small ponds and willows in the city, the scenery is not bad. However, from the north gate to the west gate to the south gate, this area has almost become a "toilet on the city wall." There is urine every three steps and feces every five steps. The stinky wind is blowing slowly, making people sick. Some adults are pulling down their pants and squatting to defecate. Children and dogs are even more out of the question.</p>
<p>When a stranger first arrives in Yingshang, the most awkward thing is the streets of Yingshang. The four main streets in the east, west, north and south are purely paved with large stone strips. These stones have been tormented and trampled for a long time and are already rugged and uneven. It is very difficult to walk on them.</p>
<p>In front of Guanzi's Tomb</p>
<p>Walking north from the so-called "Yingshang Park", bypassing the pond, you arrive at Guan Zhong's tomb. It is true that it is better to hear about it than to see it, and it is even better to hear about it than to see it. Guan Zhong's tomb is just like that.</p>
<p>A raised earth mound, about Zhang Eight high, with a circumference of more than ten Zhang, is fully planted with green pine trees, which are very lush. There is an ancient stone tablet, the lower end of which is buried in the soil and inclined forward, with the four characters "Tomb of Guan Zhongfu". There is also a recently erected stone tablet, with the big characters "Alas, the Tomb of the Great Politician Guanzi" in the middle. There are several lines of small characters on the side that read "Guan Zhong Zi Yiwu, a native of Yingshang, Confucius said: Guan Zhong assisted Duke Huan, dominated the princes, and rectified the world..." all the way to "Without Guan Zhong, we would be disheveled and wear our clothes on the left." A section of text ends. The font is written in Wei stele, but according to the era, it is a Republic of China stele.</p>
<p>Not far to the east from Guanbao Temple is the Yingshang Relief Home. The houses are all newly built, about thirty rooms, divided into old-age homes, orphanages, infant nurseries, clinics and other parts. Each has a director in charge of its affairs. The Boai Hall has become a children's church, which is very good. The clinic is located on North Main Street in the city, and those who seek medical treatment and medicine are quite crowded. Nine out of ten are suffering from hidden diseases, followed by 　　.</p>
<p>Such Education</p>
<p>Right next to Kui Xing's neighbor is the Yingshang County Mass Education Center. The curator, Cui, is known to be a kind and prudent good person at first glance. In the library and reading room, there is not a single book. There are a few newspapers, but they are all old newspapers from half a month ago. The tables and chairs are broken and incomplete. The walls and roof are dilapidated. It is too unsightly. Curator Cui said that the monthly operating expenses are only two thousand yuan, which is not enough to subscribe to the Central Daily News for half a month (the Central Daily News requires two thousand two hundred and fifty yuan for half a month). The Yingshang Mass Education Center cannot even afford a newspaper, then other equipment such as balls and chess are naturally out of the question.</p>
<p>Yingshang is a fourth-class county, and the county town has a total population of only over 10,000 people, but there are three secondary schools, which is not a small number. The County Middle School is generally considered the best. The principal, Jiang Xiaokong, is a small fat man wearing glasses and is very enthusiastic about education. The principal of the County Simple Normal School, Jiang Mingqiu, is over fifty years old, with gray hair and a cheerful manner. He is an old educator for many years. The principal of the private Yiwu Middle School, Zixijian, is a kind person. The three schools accept both male and female students, and there are many students, but the academic performance of the students is really poor. In my opinion, this is an inevitable result of the poor primary education in the county. A sixth-grade student at an elementary school asked the teacher what the Three People's Principles were, and the teacher replied: "The Three People's Principles are the idea of three types of people: scholars, farmers, and workers." This kind of thing is self-explanatory.</p>
<p>In addition to the three middle schools in the town, there is also an agricultural vocational school and a private Chengde Middle School in the countryside. Since I have not visited them, I will not say anything about them.</p>
<p>A few dozen steps out of the south gate, you can see the school gate of Yiwu Middle School. Yiwu is Guan Zhong's alias. This must be a school established to commemorate Guanzi. The school gate faces due east, directly opposite the nursery. The nursery is the location of the Yingshang Agricultural Extension Office. The area is not very large, and the natural environment is very good, but it is a pity that there is too little artificial management and design, and no signs of agricultural "extension" can be seen. 　　Small Newspaper</p>
<p>Propaganda and news newspapers are even more pitiful in Yingshang. There are two types of small stone-printed single-sided newspapers in the city. One is the "Xinying Daily", which is issued by the Yingtou Liaison Station of the Wangan Group, and one is issued every five days. The content is average. The other is the "Yingshang Daily". It is called a daily newspaper, but it is actually published every two days. The content is slightly better, but the layout is too small and the material is not rich enough. You can read the entire newspaper without missing a word in less than a quarter of an hour, and its "smallness" can be known. The subscription price of the Yingshang Daily is very low, 400 yuan per month. However, a stranger who goes to Yingshang cannot see the Yingshang Daily. There are no newspaper reading columns on the streets and alleys, no businesses and households, and no Baogu Jia in urban and rural areas. Where did the Yingshang Daily sell to? This is indeed an interesting and sad issue.</p>
<p>Poor Disaster Victims</p>
<p>As it stands, the most important issue in Yingshang is "relieving disaster victims." Disaster victims are widespread in Yingshang. Because the Shaying River and the Yellow River follow the same path, Yingshang was flooded for eight years during the eight-year Anti-Japanese War. This year after the victory, it suffered an unprecedented major flood again. From the Sancha River, not far northeast of the county seat, to Xieqiao Market, what used to be a flat road is now forty miles long, and small boats sail on the water as if floating in a large lake. Those countless villages, one by one, are submerged in the water! Some do not even see the shadow of the house, only the treetops remain, protruding from the water. Looking around, the sky is connected to the water, the water is connected to the sky, a vast expanse, boundless! All the disaster victims are sallow and emaciated, and a large number of people have died from the epidemic. According to reliable statistics, a total of 1.37 million mu of land in Yingshang was submerged, accounting for more than one-half of the total land area of the county. There are a total of 27,060 households of disaster victims, 77,602 adults, and 60,200 children, totaling more than 137,000 people. These disaster victims lack clothing and food. Seeing that the harsh winter is coming, how will they survive?</p>
<h3>Seeing Xi'an Through a Drop of Water</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Li Chi from this Newspaper</p>
<p>Xi'an Airmail, 2nd</p>
<p>It's as if the English poet William Blake wrote in two lines of poetry: "To see a world in a grain of sand, and a heaven in a wild flower." As a reporter, I am ashamed that I don't have such "magic power," I only want to see this ancient imperial capital—Chang'an—through a drop of water.</p>
<p>People who grow up on the coast of the East China Sea seem to be indifferent to water. City dwellers living along the coast with tap water supply seem to think that water (and air and sunlight, equally important elements of life!) is just something that flows out of the faucet. Who has the leisure to think about what will happen when the lead pipes have no water to draw up?</p>
<p>However, in the Northwest, as long as you arrive at Chang'an, the first gateway from the Central Plains to the Great Northwest, the concept of water is completely different. When I, as a reporter, arrived in Xi'an during the cold winter months of previous years, my first impression of the Northwest that day was the extremely alkaline and murky boiled water in my mouth. You had to drink it even if you couldn't swallow it. Looking back at the well in the house, which was more than fifty feet deep, the worker took a long time to shake the well before drawing out half a bucket of something that didn't resemble water from the bottom of the well. At that time, I thought of how precious the water wells in my hometown in the South were, often full to the brim, and I also thought of the "luxury" of Hong Kong often using half-foot diameter fire hydrants to flush street toilets and drains.</p>
<p>Not Seeing the Eight Rivers Circling Chang'an Causes Heartache</p>
<p>The loess in the Northwest contains a lot of alkali, so the water inevitably tastes bitter. There is a so-called "Sweet Water Well" in the southwest of Xi'an. The so-called "sweet" is actually just a lighter bitter taste, but it is already precious enough.</p>
<p>The taste of water is actually a small matter, because the leisurely lifestyle of "tea tasting" is long outdated. The serious problem, however, lies in the fact that the lack of water supply and the high cost of drawing water directly and fatally limit the establishment of many industries, the realization of urban scale and high-rise buildings, and, more broadly, the threat to every citizen is that the lack of water brings more diseases and harms the health of citizens. This fact will be substantiated by specific figures later.</p>
<p>However, was Chang'an as lacking in water supply in the past as it is today? I don't think so, because the first condition for population concentration is that the water problem must be solved first. The Bangzi Opera "Twice Blooming Plum" tells the story of Chen Xingyuan and the foreign story. When Chen arrived outside the Great Wall and thought of her hometown Chang'an, she sang on the overlooking hometown platform: "I can't see the eight rivers circling Chang'an, it makes my heart ache!..." These eight rivers can represent the prosperity and developed water conservancy of Chang'an in those years.</p>
<p>According to Professor Gu's research: the names of these eight rivers are the Jing River and Wei River north of Chang'an City, the Chan River and Ba River south of the city, the Lao River and Ju River east of the city, and the Feng River and Lao River west of the city. He also said: "If you want to nitpick, savoring the word "circling" in "eight rivers circling Chang'an" really describes the scenery near Chang'an vividly!"</p>
<p>However, that line in the play can only be sung by Chen Xingyuan at that time, because today, Xi'an only relies on the Jing River and Wei River. The other six rivers are silted up, dried up, and some even have no trace of the riverbed. There is no question of "circling"!</p>
<p>Skin Disease "Wins the Championship," Trachoma Ranks Second</p>
<p>Let's first look at the rainfall in Xi'an: the average rainfall in Chang'an in the past eighteen years is only 500 millimeters per year, which is about seven-tenths of the minimum 700 millimeters in the Jiangzhe area, and one-third of the maximum 1,500 millimeters. Xi'an is also less than two-thirds of the 760 millimeters of rainfall in Hanzhong area in southern Shaanxi Province; however, it is four-tenths more than the only 350 millimeters of rainfall in northern Shaanxi. From the above figures, we can see how drastic the difference in rainfall is between the southern, central, and northern parts of Shaanxi. However, forest science tells us that afforestation can change the climate. Many examples prove that after the completion of the afforestation plan, the local rainfall can increase by one-half. It is up to people to make it happen, and people will conquer nature. Also, it is said that a major drought occurred in Xi'an in the years 1928 and 1929, when the rainfall was only 200 to 300 millimeters. At that time, all the vegetation inside and outside the city was completely scorched. Therefore, 99% of the trees we see in the city today were planted after 1930. Why do people forget such a painful experience so quickly?</p>
<p>Please look at the records of the Provincial Hospital in Xi'an, which has a history of fifteen years and treats 100,000 outpatients every year: according to the hospital's precise statistics of departments and diseases (from July to December last year), the most common patients in the ophthalmology department are various types of trachoma; the top three in the dermatology and venereal disease department are various types of eczema, impetigo, and scabies; and in the internal medicine department, lung disease accounts for one-tenth of the cases, ranking first.</p>
<p>Let's zoom out and look at the disease statistics for the entire Shaanxi Province. According to the latest figures released by the Shaanxi Provincial Health Department, skin disease "wins the championship," and trachoma ranks only second. They also added the following explanation: in the hilly areas of northern Shaanxi and the mountainous areas of southern Shaanxi, due to the lack of water, the "rampant" prevalence of skin diseases and trachoma is even more severe than in the Jingwei River Basin in Guanzhong.</p>
<p>Think about it: people living in cave dwellings who never dare to imagine having other water consumption besides the water they drink, aren't they the most qualified to suffer from eczema, scabies, and trachoma? Fortunately, the Northwest has sufficient sunlight, which invisibly kills many bacteria, and the transmission and infection of lung diseases can therefore be considered to be more through the esophagus and stomach than through the nasal cavity and trachea. I have seen kitchens that provide food for fifty people, and in order to save a basin of water, they would rather patiently wipe each of the fifty pairs of chopsticks with a cloth after meals for "dry cleaning." I have seen enough of the waiters in the middle and upper-class restaurants wiping their chopsticks on their scarves after the guests finish eating and putting them back in the chopstick tube to wait for the next guest to use. I have also seen enough of a soybean milk vendor and a soup noodle vendor never using any water to wash spoons, bowls, or utensils from the time they open for business until they sell out. Countless examples prove how terrible the lack of water is, increasing the chances of infectious diseases. Although having water does not necessarily completely eliminate the above-mentioned most prevalent diseases, undoubtedly, if everyone has sufficient water for use, drinking water, and boiled water, at the very least, it will greatly reduce the chance of getting sick.</p>
<p>Water, Brighter Than Diamonds, Is an Urgent Task</p>
<p>"One pound of treatment is not as good as one ounce of prevention," but effective prevention often needs to be extended to social environmental hygiene and social treatment policies. In the Northwest, right at its first gateway—Xi'an—the relationship between water and environmental hygiene has already been seen.</p>
<p>China's century-old or even millennium-old plan is not limited to the southeastern coast. To design with foresight, it is necessary to inject development into the northwestern corner. After the recovery, I haven't heard the slogan of building the Great Northwest for a long time, but I believe that the Northwest will one day be valued again, and those who come to the Northwest with grand plans must first consider the fight for water and against diseases. Europeans and Americans developed Southeast Asia and the Philippines and established tropical medicine, and the Japanese invasion of China also established "continental medicine." These are all good examples. Large-scale development of the Northwest must start with the health care of immigrants. Secondly, the health care of the local residents should also be given the same attention. According to doctors returning from Xinjiang and Qinghai, the Han people brought many diseases, which were not serious among the Han people, but because the local people had never had these diseases, they naturally lacked resistance, so the condition was unexpectedly serious. However, in any case, before medicine and drugs, what is more urgently needed is still water, water that is brighter than diamonds!</p>

<p>Hygiene and Medicine</p>
<h3>On Injections and Prescriptions (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Qian De</p>
<p>(4) Treatment Should Focus on General Principles</p>
<p>After a disease breaks out, it must be diagnosed and treated early, but treatment is not limited to medication. Paying attention to general principles, maintaining and increasing physical strength to facilitate the fight against the disease is ten times more important than taking medicine and injections. Even if it is a minor illness such as a cold and cough, if these principles are not followed, it may worsen and turn into pneumonia. By that time, lying down again, fortunately being able to recover, the spirit, time, and economy have suffered several times the losses. The following principles may seem like clichés, and are unremarkable, but if they can be earnestly observed in the diagnosis, treatment, and recovery period, it will definitely be greatly beneficial to the progress of the disease.</p>
<p>1. Give the patient sufficient physical and mental rest, so that his body is full of energy to fight the disease.</p>
<p>2. Give the patient sufficient calories, appropriate protein, carbohydrates, fats, salts, and vitamins to increase his resistance and repair ability. As long as his stomach and intestines can digest and breathe, a balanced diet can provide him with all the daily needs. In cases of gastrointestinal diseases, diabetes, and kidney disease, dietary regulation is even more important, and should be followed after being determined by a doctor.</p>
<p>3. Keep the functions of bowel movements and the skin unimpeded, so as to facilitate the removal of waste and toxins. Generally speaking, except for organic edema, drinking more water is always good.</p>
<p>4. It is necessary to take methods to alleviate the symptoms that the patient feels the most painful, hinder his tranquility, and weaken his physical strength. If medication is needed, the principle is not to conceal the original appearance of the disease and hinder diagnosis.</p>
<p>The purpose is nothing more than (1) to use symptomatic drugs or special drugs to treat the disease after the diagnosis is established, and (2) to give special drugs to test their efficacy in order to achieve the purpose of indirect diagnosis when the diagnosis is not certain and a certain disease is suspected. Prescriptions should have indications and are by no means for courtesy. They cannot be issued casually. Once medication is started, it should be thoroughly implemented to achieve complete success. However, there is no medicine that is perfect and without drawbacks. Similarly, two people with the same disease have different symptoms, and two people have different reactions to the same medicine. Even the same patient's reaction to the medicine varies depending on the situation. Therefore, treatment must have principles and cannot be fixed. There is no saying that a certain medicine will definitely cure a certain disease, let alone a panacea that can be taken regularly. For example, Tubercidin is effective against amebic dysentery, but an overdose can also cause diarrhea; alkaline powder is effective against peptic ulcers, but it is not equally effective against other "stomach diseases." How to recognize the indications, be familiar with the properties of the medicine, choose the timing, carefully increase or decrease the dosage, and let the patient know its advantages and disadvantages to achieve the highest therapeutic effect is the responsibility of the doctor.</p>
<p>The so-called thorough treatment is not only the disappearance of symptoms, but also the root cause and prevention of recurrence. Originally, various diseases, unless they quickly progress to death, generally have remission phenomena in the process. Without treatment, they can also be temporarily reduced, and when they recur, they are even worse. For example, after one or two injections of 914 for syphilis, local symptoms can disappear, and hemoptysis of pulmonary tuberculosis can be stopped by taking some unrelated medicines. This certainly does not mean that syphilis and tuberculosis have been cured. There are many similar examples. How can it be considered a cure? The doctor knows it in his heart, but because the patient is already satisfied with this and publishes a thank-you note in the newspaper, he also enjoys the success. This is really a tragicomedy.</p>
<p>There is now a very common and extremely dangerous phenomenon, that is, the widespread abuse of sulfonamide drugs. Drug dealers can use it to make pills, injections, toothpaste, etc. Patients also believe that this is a good home medicine for governing all diseases. Since it is called "anti-inflammatory pills," they don't care about colds, coughs, toothaches, or fevers. As long as they think it is "inflammation," they can prescribe it themselves and take it casually and piecemeal. We often criticize traditional Chinese medicine for prescribing dozens of medicines in one prescription as a complex prescription (Gun Shat prescription). This situation of governing all diseases with one medicine can be called sweep therapy. After all, how many diseases are cured by this is questionable, because the efficacy of this medicine can only be achieved after regular and large doses are taken for several days; but there must be some patients who develop poisoning or drug resistance due to this irregular use, and it will no longer be effective when it must be taken. This is tantamount to using a sharp knife as a toy, which is very regrettable. Similarly, penicillin was a great invention in the medical field during this war, and it has saved countless lives. However, in the producing countries, it still cannot be supplied without restrictions. In our country, it has become a worshipped product for patients and a tool for colleagues to make money, and it is abused to an unbelievable extent! The author knows that some people have used it to treat abdominal distension and injected it every other day to treat stomach cancer. If Dr. A. Fleming knew about this, he would definitely feel both funny and sad.</p>
<p>All of the above violate the principles of treatment. Patients are ignorant of this. How to correct this trend is also the responsibility of the doctor.</p>
<p>(6) Is Injection Necessary?</p>
<p>Now that it has been decided that medication is needed, it is nothing more than to enter it through various routes such as oral administration, injection, inhalation, enema, and topical application. Because the biggest use of the mouth is eating, it is the simplest, most natural, and most commonly used route of administration should be oral administration. However, because of the injection fees and surgery fees, drug dealers and doctors cooperated sincerely. Drug dealers manufactured some injections for replenishing blood, clearing blood, strengthening the heart, etc., with numerous categories. It is not necessary to use drugs at all, but injections are given. It is clear that oral administration can be used, but injections are even more necessary. Doctors are used by others and go to deceive patients. They take the opportunity to persuade them to get injections. Patients are originally ignorant of this, but since people say that a few injections can cure the root cause, and the names of replenishing blood and strengthening the heart sound comfortable, they unknowingly regard this as a fashionable and quick-acting treatment and accept it. Today, they have a mentality that they think that they always have to get a prescription when they see a doctor, and it is best to get an injection. If you tell him that he does not need a prescription and is against injections, he will think that you are an out-of-date and ignorant doctor! You must know: how much money rolls into the pockets of drug dealers and doctors from this? How many patients have local ulcers, infections, and become abscesses and sepsis because they like injections, and thus lost their lives?</p>
<p>So, is "injection" necessary? Injection has its place, but it is only needed in the following situations. Beyond this, it is abuse and business. The indications that require injection are:</p>
<p>1. Those who need rapid drug action in emergency cases, such as acute opium poisoning with Coramine, caffeine, etc.</p>
<p>2. Patients who are comatose and cannot take oral medicine, such as cerebral malignant malaria requiring quinine, and epidemic encephalitis requiring Sofratoluene injection.</p>
<p>3. Patients who cannot tolerate and absorb drugs orally due to vomiting and diarrhea, such as cholera requiring physiological saline injection.</p>
<p>4. Drugs that are decomposed and ineffective by gastric juice after oral administration, such as adrenaline, 914, insulin, plasma, and vaccines.</p>
<p>Some people think that injection can avoid gastrointestinal irritation, but it is unreliable because any drug is more irritating to veins or tissues than to the gastrointestinal tract. Others say that injection can more accurately calculate the dosage, but it is also specious, because the main purpose of drug administration is to be effective, and a slight difference in dosage is not a problem.</p>
<p>In addition to the misfortunes caused by poor injection techniques mentioned in the previous section, injection, especially intravenous injection, can also cause terrible or fatal reactions, and once injected, it cannot be washed out like oral administration. Furthermore, after repeated punctures, phlebitis often occurs, which may cause embolic symptoms. In the future, when intravenous injection is really needed, it will be more difficult because it has been blocked.</p>
<p>There are limited indications that require injections, but the possible accidents and adverse effects are great. May I ask patients, why must you spend dozens of times more on injection drugs than on oral drugs and buy some pain and accidents?</p>
<p>(7) Advise Patients Faithfully</p>
<p>It is not necessary to further explain more to patients on the issue. Only the key points mentioned above are provided as follows:</p>
<p>1. Know some consultant doctors and friends, often have relationships, get more knowledge about daily health maintenance and disease prevention, receive preventive injections and regular health checkups, and if there are any shortcomings, diagnose and treat them early, so as to prevent problems before they occur. These doctor friends know your past situation well and it is easy to diagnose diseases.</p>
<p>2. See a doctor early when you are sick, and tell him the cause and symptoms of the illness, but don't be smart and make a diagnosis yourself. Diagnosis is not necessarily easy, and you should give him enough time for research and observation.</p>
<p>3. Do not seek medical treatment randomly, and do not change doctors often. The busiest doctors are not necessarily the most skilled doctors.</p>
<p>4. Do not take medicine randomly. Medication should be started only after the diagnosis is confirmed. Do not expect to take medicine home every time you see a doctor. Doctors who truthfully tell you how to recuperate without prescribing a prescription are mostly more sincere and reliable than doctors who prescribe prescriptions randomly. The money saved from buying things that are not necessary can be used to adjust your diet, etc., which is more beneficial.</p>
<p>5. No matter what kind of disease, paying attention to nutrition, rest, and physical and mental comfort is at least as important as prescribing medicine. Abandoning this is too much.</p>
<p>6. Medication must have clear indications. To hope for a good therapeutic effect, you must race against time, follow the doctor's advice, and implement it to the end. Irregular, incomplete, or aimless treatment may produce results that are worse than not treating.</p>
<p>7. The safest and most convenient route of drug administration is oral administration. Injections are only needed in a very few cases. Injections have various reactions and harms, cost several times more than oral administration, and have limited efficacy. There is no reason to widely promote them. If a doctor persuades you to get blood-replenishing injections or blood-cleansing injections, this is his business, and you can thank him for his kindness and ignore it.</p>
<p>8. There is no medicine that has no side effects or drawbacks, so all medicines cannot be abused; the condition is constantly changing, and the needs are different accordingly, so there is no prescription that can be taken regularly without the doctor's correction.</p>
<p>9. Doctors always know more about the condition than you do, and they always have their own position on the decisions you make. Complete trust in him is like taking some good medicine for your spirit. Equally important and necessary is that the doctor's success in diagnosis and treatment also depends entirely on your cooperation.</p>
<h3>The Miracle Drug of 1946</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ming</p>
<p>Two months ago, this publication's editorial department received a translated manuscript from Mr. Yiwen titled "The Miracle Drug of 1946." The translation was fine, but because the original content was unreliable, it was not published.</p>
<p>The original title of the article, "Gods’ Own Medicine, 1948 Mode," appeared in the June issue of Reader's Digest, authored by Pautl de Cruir.</p>
<p>The author, Cruir, although holding a doctorate, is not a doctor and is known for writing popular medical articles. However, his reports are often exaggerated, leading to inaccuracies. Readers often fall for this. This gentleman frequently publishes such popular medical articles in widely circulated American publications like Reader's Digest, disregarding scientific accuracy and focusing on sensationalism. As a result, the Journal of the American Medical Association has repeatedly written articles to correct his claims. Cruir's article is largely the same as the promotional materials of the American Bayer (Winthrop) company for Demerol, so the editors of the Journal of the American Medical Association criticized him for advertising for pharmaceutical companies and spreading inaccurate information.</p>
<p>The so-called "Miracle Drug of 1946" refers to Demerol. He says, "This drug has a pain-relieving effect similar to morphine but is not as addictive. Many hospitals in the United States have tested this new drug, and many patients who had never used narcotics before did not become addicted at all."</p>
<p>He then embellished with numerous reports praising its various therapeutic effects and advantages, but he did not mention any reports of its drawbacks. Although he lightly mentions, "This drug may also cause a desire in some users, a desire to continue using it," he then adds, "This is not addiction because there are no adverse effects upon withdrawal."</p>
<p>Finally, he says, "The American scientific community calls it the '1946 model miracle drug,' and doctors call it GOM."</p>
<p>Although the author presents himself as a scientist and even cites the names of many scientists in the article in a serious manner, in reality, this is a myth, if not a manufacturer's advertisement.</p>
<p>The truth is this: "Demerol is a... analgesic, sedative, and antispasmodic. Its analgesic effect is between morphine and codeine; however, it does not cause constipation, pupillary constriction, or respiratory depression, and it has a significant antispasmodic effect, making it particularly effective for visceral colic caused by smooth muscle spasms, which is its advantage. However, it is also addictive, although not as severe as morphine, which is its only drawback." In the 1945 edition of Zhang Changshao's Practical Pharmacology, its advantages and disadvantages were completely and faithfully introduced. The so-called "1946 model" miracle drug was thoroughly researched by scientists in 1945, even several years earlier. It is neither a "1946 model" nor a "God's Own" miracle drug. In China, Demerol is called Dolantin, which has been fashionable for three or four years. After Bayer's blitz marketing, most doctors have already blindly believed that this drug is "God's Own" miracle drug. Exposing the relationship between Demerol and Dolantin, Mr. Cruir's article does not have much impact on the Chinese people. Anyway, everyone is educated by pharmaceutical companies' promotional materials and instructions, so they unanimously say that Dolantin is not addictive. Therefore, they inject patients with ten or twenty shots, and the patients say this drug is really good and want more injections. The doctors say that since this drug is not addictive, they give them another ten or twenty shots. Later, many patients buy Dolantin themselves and continue to inject it. However, many doctors still believe Bayer's instructions, thinking that this is not addiction and that Dolantin will never be addictive. After the victory, Dolantin became an even more popular drug for quitting smoking, a savior for those in the underworld. Little do they know that opium and morphine addiction have secretly changed hands, replaced by imported Dolantin addiction, changing the soup but not the medicine.</p>
<p>The fact that Demerol or Dolantin can be addictive like morphine has long been reported by medical circles in various countries. Recently, Mr. Anslinger, the head of the U.S. Bureau of Narcotics, published many cases of Demerol addiction in the Journal of the American Medical Association on September 7 of this year, many of whom are doctors. Poor doctors, most of them were fooled by pharmaceutical companies' promotions and became victims of pharmaceutical advertising!</p>
<p>Demerol, or Dolantin, has long been classified as a narcotic by the U.S. Congress and has been subject to the sanctions and management of the Federal Narcotic Law along with morphine and cocaine since July 1, 1944. It is reported that the Narcotic Drugs Management Bureau of our country is also considering classifying this drug as a narcotic and managing it to prevent abuses.</p>
<p>Dolantin certainly has advantages over morphine, but it also has disadvantages. For example, its pain-relieving power is not as strong as morphine, nor is it as reliable. As for addictiveness, we should treat Dolantin and morphine equally, be equally vigilant, and avoid prolonged continuous use.</p>
<p>The truth about Demerol, or Dolantin, is that non-commercial scientists in the United States do not call it the "1946 model miracle drug," and non-quack doctors in the United States do not simply call it GOM. They recognize it as a substitute for morphine, but it has the same risk of addiction. When applying it, they remember that it is within the scope of federal narcotic drug management and use it carefully to avoid violating national law and harming patients.</p>
<p>We must know that: China has inferior and fake drugs, and foreign countries also have inferior and fake drugs; China has deceptive advertisements, and foreign countries also have deceptive... China has unprincipled scientists and doctors, and mercenary merchants do improper advertising and promotion, and foreign countries also have the same, the same. Let us discard this inferiority complex—</p>
<p>Chinese goods are not good,</p>
<p>Foreign goods must be better;</p>
<p>Chinese articles are not credible,</p>
<p>Foreign articles must be reliable;</p>
<p>Even the foreign moon</p>
<p>Is more beautiful than the Chinese one.</p>
<h3>A Discussion on Gynecological Diseases</h3>
<p>— Tang Shuzhi</p>
<p>Chinese women often avoid seeking medical treatment for gynecological diseases, and only when they reach a serious stage do they reluctantly seek medical attention, which often leads to irreversible cases. The author will provide a simple introduction to the most important gynecological diseases, so that patients are aware of the dangers and avoid losing the opportunity for early treatment.</p>
<p>(1) Cancer: Cancer is most common in the elderly and middle-aged (over 35 years old). Cervical cancer is the most common. This disease has no special symptoms or pain in its early stages because the cervix itself lacks pain nerves. By the time symptoms are discovered, such as increased leucorrhea or bleeding, the disease has become quite serious. Normal women only have slight leucorrhea before and after menstruation or during the mid-menstrual cycle (ovulation period). If increased leucorrhea is found at other times, or if women who have stopped menstruating suddenly bleed or have leucorrhea, they must seek medical attention immediately. If waiting for heavy bleeding or abdominal pain, the good opportunity for early treatment has been lost. Because in the first stage of cervical cancer, those who can survive for more than five years can account for 70%, the second stage drops to 40%, and the third stage is only 15% to 25%; as for the fourth stage, even if encountering a famous doctor, they will be helpless. According to statistics of general outpatient cases, only 10% of cervical cancer patients are in the early stage, and the remaining several tens of percent wait until the cervix is ulcerated, bleeding heavily, or spread to other parts, causing unbearable pain, before seeking medical attention. It is said that the reason for delaying medical treatment is due to the misconception of "nine out of ten women have leucorrhea"; and bleeding, because menstruation comes every month, is a common occurrence, and they fail to take it as a warning, and because there is no pain in the early stages, they often ignore it. The seriousness of cervical cancer is such that we should do our best to take effective preventive measures. If there is leucorrhea usually (mostly caused by cervicitis), medical attention should be sought immediately. If procrastinating, not only is chronic inflammation difficult to treat, but cervical cancer may also follow. Although the direct cause of cervical cancer is still not fully understood, chronic cervicitis is related to the occurrence of cancer. Although cervical cancer is more common in parous women, unmarried women can also develop this disease, so it is important to pay attention. Therefore, whether unmarried or married, if there is a lot of leucorrhea, medical attention should be sought as soon as possible. And those who are 30 years old or older should have a gynecological examination every six months or a year, because although there are no special symptoms in the early stage of cancer, this period is quite long (lasting for several months). Missing this period will reduce the effectiveness of treatment.</p>
<p>(2) Tumor Diseases: 1. Uterine Leiomyoma: This type of tumor is more common in middle-aged women, and most common in unmarried women. (It is said that if you do not have children, you will develop a tumor). Its main symptoms are irregular menstruation, heavy flow, prolonged bleeding period, or shortened cycle. When the tumor is small, it must be diagnosed through vaginal examination. If it is slightly larger, a hard mass can be felt on the lower abdomen. Once this tumor is diagnosed, it must be removed as soon as possible, otherwise, not only will there be difficulties in the removal surgery after a long time, but other complications such as turning into cancer will also easily occur.</p>
<p>2. Ovarian Cyst (commonly known as water tumor): This tumor is more common in middle-aged and young people. When the tumor is small, there are no symptoms. It rises from the lower abdomen when it is slightly larger. It can grow to weigh dozens of pounds, making the abdomen as big as a drum. Its common complication is torsion of the tumor pedicle, or acute abdominal pain, accompanied by vomiting, etc., which must be removed immediately. Other common complications are adhesion to the intestines, inflammation, or turning into cancer after a long time. In short: Although the tumor is benign, once diagnosed, it must be removed as soon as possible, which is the best strategy.</p>
<p>(3) Salpingitis or Fallopian Tube Inflammation: The pathogen is mostly caused by the invasion of gonococci into the reproductive tract. Early symptoms include increased leucorrhea, initially thin and later thick. Or pain during urination or abdominal pain and fever. Once discovered in the acute phase, absolute rest and treatment with sulfa drugs or penicillin must be used. It gradually becomes chronic inflammation. It is easy to recur before and after menstruation, leading to fallopian tube blockage, which is a major cause of infertility. According to men transmitting this disease to women, they can still have hope of restoring reproductive ability after being cured, while in women, if not treated properly in the acute phase, their reproductive ability will be lost as a result.</p>
<p>(4) Menstrual Irregularities: If endocrine is unbalanced during development, menstrual irregularities often occur. Therefore, during the developmental period, it is important to have a rich diet and pay attention to hygiene. However, in middle-aged women, attention should be paid to whether there are tumors or cancer. There are also menstrual irregularities during menopause. However, cancer occurs very often during this period, so you cannot be too careful.</p>
<p>(5) Infertility: There are many causes of infertility, and the biggest main causes are incomplete development or fallopian tube obstruction. Whenever there is infertility, the male should also undergo a detailed examination by a doctor. The most important thing is to test the quality of the sperm and its activity.</p>

<h3>The Battle Between Humans and Germs (9)</h3>
<p>— Excerpted from "Infectious Disease Management" by Qiao Shumin</p>
<p>2. Transmission Routes</p>
<p>The transmission routes of infectious diseases vary, mainly including direct or indirect contact transmission, respiratory transmission, gastrointestinal transmission, and insect transmission. The way to suppress it is to cut off its routes, which can be discussed in terms of disinfection and the eradication of harmful insects and animals. (7) Disinfection——Disinfection is the method of killing pathogenic microorganisms, and it is the key to cutting off the transmission route.</p>
<p>A. Disinfection Regarding Infectious Disease Patients:</p>
<p>(1) Continuous Disinfection——During the course of the disease, continuous disinfection of all excretions, sputum, pollutants, and items that may be contaminated is the fundamental way to suppress transmission.</p>
<p>(2) Terminal Disinfection——After the infectious disease patient recovers, dies, or moves away, disinfecting all items inside that may be contaminated is called terminal disinfection. In fact, if continuous disinfection can be done thoroughly, terminal disinfection is not necessary.</p>
<p>B. Disinfection Regarding Public Supplies: Disinfection of daily necessities such as milk, drinks, food, tableware, toothbrushes, towels, and the air in public places is also important, especially during the epidemic of infectious diseases.</p>
<p>B. Disinfection Methods——When we implement disinfection, we should first understand the nature of the pathogens and the transmission routes. Although there are many disinfection methods, they must be used properly to be effective. We must not blindly rely on the function of disinfectants.</p>
<p>8. Natural Disinfection Methods——Nature has a strong disinfection power, but it is inconvenient to use in daily life. If we can find a way to use it, the cost will be the lowest.</p>
<p>(1) Sunlight——The ultraviolet rays, blue-violet rays, and heat rays in sunlight all have bactericidal power. The magnitude of its bactericidal power is always proportional to the intensity of the light and the duration of exposure. Items such as books used by patients, which are not suitable for disinfection by other methods, can be used with this method. Expose them to strong sunlight for one or two hours in each place.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet rays are now used for air disinfection and are quite effective.</p>
<p>(2) Drying——Absolute drying is enough to destroy general bacteria. However, the dryness of various bacteria varies under various conditions, and the time required for sterilization varies.</p>
<p>(3) Dilution——Gastrointestinal bacteria can also be killed after a high degree of dilution.</p>
<p>(4) Decomposition——When feces decompose, bacteria can be killed.</p>
<p>B. Physical Disinfection Methods——Light, electricity, and heat can all be used for disinfection. However, in practice, "heat" is mainly used. Heat is divided into dry heat and wet heat:</p>
<p>(1) Dry Heat</p>
<p>(1) Incineration——This is one of the best and most reliable disinfection methods. All not very valuable waste that can be burned should be disposed of by incineration.</p>
<p>(2) Dry Hot Air——The penetrating power of dry hot air is weak, and the temperature needs to reach 150 degrees Celsius or more and last for one hour to kill bacteria with spores. At this high temperature, there is damage to the fibers of fabrics, so it is no longer very common. It is only used for disinfecting leather books and other items that are afraid of water and glassware.</p>
<p>(2) Wet Heat</p>
<p>(1) Boiling——This is a simple, easy, and most suitable disinfection method. Generally, boiling for five minutes can kill most bacteria with spores. However, killing tubercle bacilli and anthrax bacteria takes a little longer. In general, beverages and food should be disinfected by this method, but for the poison of milk, in order to preserve the nutritional value in it, the boiling method is often not used, but the Pasteurization method is used. Even if every part of the milk is heated to 143.5 degrees Fahrenheit and lasts for 30 minutes to eliminate the pathogenic bacteria contained in it; or heated to 160 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 minutes and then quickly cooled, it is also possible.</p>
<p>(2) Steam——The penetrating power of steam heat is stronger, especially when there is high pressure. When the pressure is increased, the heat also increases accordingly. Nowadays, general disinfection devices all use this steam heat.</p>
<p>(9) Chemical Disinfection Methods——Chemical disinfection is not very reliable and is mostly dangerous. It is only limited to cases where heat disinfection methods cannot be used. Common disinfectants include the following dozen or so types:</p>
<p>(1) Lime——This is the most economical disinfectant, but it must be unslaked lime to be effective. If used to disinfect feces, take an equal amount of lime and mix it with the feces. Disinfection is completed after two hours. If used as a common disinfectant, take one part of lime, mix it with two parts of clean water, and then pour it into five times the amount of water to make a lime milk disinfectant.</p>
<p>(2) Bleaching Powder——This is a compound of chlorine and lime. It should be stored in a closed container to prevent the loss of chlorine. General bleaching powder can contain 30% chlorine. Mix one pound of bleaching powder with two gallons of water to make a disinfectant that is easy to use. It can be used to disinfect feces, urine, phlegm, and nasal mucus (mix with an equal amount of disinfectant and let stand for one hour). Bleaching powder is also convenient to use for drinking water disinfection. Generally, adding about 1.5 parts per million of chlorine to the water is effective, depending on the clarity of the water.</p>
<p>(3) Mercuric Chloride——This agent has a strong bactericidal power. A 1/1000 solution is enough to kill general bacteria within half an hour, and a 2/1000 solution is enough to kill bacteria with spores. However, this agent easily combines with proteins, so it cannot be used to disinfect feces, phlegm, etc. Also, this substance is very poisonous and should not be used to disinfect tableware.</p>
<p>In addition to mercuric chloride, mercury compounds also include Mercurochrome, which is commonly used in general clinics. Its effectiveness is very low and unreliable.</p>
<p>(4) Carbolic Acid</p>
<p>(5) Lysol</p>
<p>(6) Potassium Permanganate——A 5% solution has bactericidal power. However, the price is relatively high, so it should only be used for small-scale disinfection of well water, food, and tableware.</p>
<p>(7) Soap——The bactericidal power of general soap is very weak, but when it is scrubbed with hot water to form a foam film, it also has the function of removing bacteria.</p>
<p>(8) Alcohol——The bactericidal power of alcohol is not very strong. A 50% to 70% solution is most effective. Too concentrated or too dilute is not good.</p>
<p>Whooping Cough Serum Explained</p>
<p>Antipertussis rabbit serum has various products, some of which are antitoxic and some contain antibacterial ingredients. The latter is more effective.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, Bradford and Day of the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Rochester in the United States reported that streptomycin is very effective for whooping cough bacillus infection in mice. Of the 20 mice infected with this bacillus, 9 died without treatment, and the mortality rate was nearly 50%. On the other hand, in the 20 mice treated with streptomycin, only one died, that is, the mortality rate was 5%, only one-tenth of the mortality rate of the untreated group. The university is currently testing this drug on clinical cases. If the same satisfactory results can be obtained, then in addition to serum, whooping cough will have another special prize.</p>
<p>We should note that Penicillin has no therapeutic effect on whooping cough, but it may have a good effect on complications such as pneumonia during the course of whooping cough. There is a current trend of using Aerosol solutions of streptomycin, vaporizing it and having the patient inhale deeply, which can eliminate the bacteria in the lungs.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Rabbit</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiqu</p>
<p>I never had any particular fondness for small animals. Apart from those repulsive caterpillars, I'm willing to keep any animal, given the opportunity.</p>
<p>During the war, I served in Shan County, near the Yellow River. The riverbank's sandy ground was dug up by the National Army to create many machine gun positions and trenches. Initially, the intention was to engage in a bloody battle with the enemy here. However, the enemy never crossed the river at this location. Eventually, the trenches were overgrown with weeds, becoming a playground for foxes and rabbits.</p>
<p>Some colleagues who enjoyed hunting would often take advantage of "air raid alerts" to catch wild rabbits. But due to a lack of good tools and deep resolve, they never managed to catch a single one.</p>
<p>One day, a colleague suddenly brought back a snow-white rabbit, claiming that he had personally caught it at Taiyang Ferry. Everyone excitedly and enviously gathered around, admiring the rabbit while inquiring about the capture process. Some suggested slaughtering it to accompany their drinks, while others proposed keeping it to find a female mate (this one was supposedly male) so they could breed rabbits and sell them in the future, or at least have the skins for everyone to get a pair of fur-lined gloves. Finally, amid the various opinions, the director stepped in and concluded: "One rabbit isn't enough for everyone to eat, and it's troublesome to raise. Besides, these things aren't clean and urinate everywhere. If the yard is filled with rabbit urine and rabbit droppings, what kind of image would it project when visitors come to inspect?" The director's opinion was certainly brilliant, but our organization was quite democratic. The director's words weren't a holy decree, and other opinions were still voiced and seconded.</p>
<p>As more and more opinions were offered, the disputes deepened. The colleague who caught the rabbit had already achieved his goal of showing off and had long retreated from the discussion of how to deal with the rabbit. As for the unfortunate creature, it was like a prisoner awaiting execution, a cotton-like ball huddled in the darkest corner under the bed, as if it had already foreseen that humans would never treat it kindly. So, no matter how you poked it with a bamboo pole or tempted it with vegetable leaves, it remained resolute and unresponsive. This dispute was temporarily alleviated due to its stubbornness.</p>
<p>The next day, my colleagues went out to work, and I was on duty for purchasing, staying behind.</p>
<p>After arranging the vegetables, I moved a deck chair outside and leisurely read the day's newspaper. Accidentally looking back, I suddenly saw that the little creature had secretly sneaked out of the dormitory. It was so cautious, wary of its enemies. Its ruby-red eyes were wide open, and its long, furry ears were listening everywhere for any sounds of hostility. Its two short, furry front legs barely moved an inch before its rear end quickly twitched. My newspaper unintentionally made a slight noise, and it twitched several times, running back to the dormitory. I felt quite ashamed. It wasn't that I particularly sympathized with the weak, but I truly felt that humans were too harsh on it! There was no reason for it to approach or trust us, with no intention of harming it.</p>
<p>The second time it came out, I did my best to control myself, even reducing my breathing to the minimum to avoid making it feel uneasy. I let it gradually explore, pass through the courtyard, and reach the kitchen door, where some discarded vegetable leaves lay. The cook didn't pay attention to these. In his eyes, this piece of long white fur was just something the gentlemen bought as a treat, like beef, vegetables, and other ingredients, all raw materials for cooking. He neither found it novel nor repulsive, and continued his work as usual, throwing out the radish tops he needed to discard from the window. But the timid rabbit didn't understand the thrower's intention, and immediately fled away as fast as it could, as if escaping a bomb. But it only ran halfway before slowing down. From then on, it considered the area near the kitchen door a danger zone and dared not go there again. So it moved along the wall, looking for other opportunities to solve its livelihood problems. But the cleaning movement had long since removed those plants that could serve as snacks for herbivorous animals.</p>
<p>It considered what it could eat to be dangerous and dared not approach it, starving itself while trying to find delicious things in a hopeless garden. It was both laughable and pitiable. After a long time, it seemed to be unbearably hungry, and I really couldn't bear it anymore. So I got up quietly—although it was quietly, it still frightened it, causing it to flee to the dormitory door. Now, the dormitory had become its refuge—I went to the kitchen, picked some fresh vegetable leaves and a piece of snow-white radish, and sat back in the deck chair, displaying my good things to it, tempting it to come and enjoy them.</p>
<p>But it seemed to have deep-seated prejudices against humans, or perhaps its eyes had a problem, only able to smell with its nose and not see with its eyes. No matter how I showed off, it simply ignored me.</p>
<p>After a while, seeing that it was ineffective, I couldn't bother to serve it anymore. So I threw the vegetable leaves and radish at the door and continued to read my newspaper, ignoring it.</p>
<p>After some time, I accidentally looked up and found it chewing on a root of the vegetable near the ditch. After that, it also walked around, taking a tour, seemingly planning to stay for a long time. It no longer harbored the same hostility towards me and the cook, the only two humans, as it had in the past, although it still timidly kept an eye on our expressions, showing a pitiful appearance like a new student entering school. But it was very different from the trembling state it had been in when it first arrived yesterday. However, in the evening, when the large group of people returned from work outside, it had to return to the place it had taken refuge in yesterday to mutter to itself.</p>
<p>For several days, people left and it came out, people returned and it went in, and it was all peaceful. In fact, people were no longer as enthusiastic about it as they had been when it first arrived. And because it had started using my bunk as a refuge, and later my box frame as a lodging place, I felt as if there was a connection between us and gradually regarded myself as its protector. I was happy that it was quite frugal, only needing a little grass and roots to be satisfied. Moreover, the place it lived in was never as dirty and smelly as we often see in rabbit cages. On the contrary, it was very concerned about hygiene, going to the latrine to urinate and defecate, without needing anyone to bring it a chamber pot. It also didn't have selfish habits, never intending to hide leftover radish tops to enjoy tomorrow. Although it was so cowardly that almost all animals in the world could bully it, it was never pessimistic, still solemnly, cautiously, and frankly having a pure and peaceful soul like a hermit. When it rested, it was also like an experienced elder, crouching under the porch in the sun. It didn't chant Amitabha like a hypocritical cat, but it was indeed fasting and eating vegetarian food, being quiet and inactive. Given its status, it was not suitable to live on a battlefield of killing and war or in a city of sensual pleasures. It was only fit to be among flower beds and lawns, among artificial mountains and lake rocks, as a companion of bees and butterflies, living a lifetime of peaceful and tranquil life.</p>
<p>It was so sincere, but not at all unintelligent. Its pair of long ears were always high and clear, occasionally detecting wind sounds, checking left and right, front and back. When it discovered a potential danger, it had already "preserved itself wisely" without alarming anyone, secretly slipping away. If the enemy was too harsh, relentlessly pursuing it, or there was no way to escape, or it predicted that the enemy's speed of advance was faster than its own, then it also knew how to be angry, to resist and condemn. However, its anger was polite, and its resistance was moral. It was unwilling to use hidden arrows, ambushes, or retaliatory attacks, and certainly would not use secret weapons like atomic bombs, but used its coarse and plain hind legs to make a "pat pat" sound on the ground to warn the enemy: "Don't go too far, leave some room to accumulate virtue for your descendants!"</p>
<p>This kind of ancient and benevolent resistance often had results. Because the enemies it encountered were not truly mortal enemies. Sometimes it was the mischievous children of the neighbors, sometimes it was just that people were doing something unrelated and startled it.</p>
<p>Only once did its ridiculous resistance fail.</p>
<p>An air raid alert came, and people had all fled far away to the suburbs. The yard was as quiet as a wilderness. Because I was sick, I sat on the bed, listening to the sound of the plane, hoping to be spared. It was happily running around in the yard, as if it had returned to its hometown. Soon, enemy planes were overhead. My mood became more tense, but it remained leisurely. After a while, a bomb exploded in the distance. It suddenly startled but did not hide, only constantly waving its long ears, quietly observing the truth of the situation. Soon, another bomb exploded, the sound closer. It panicked, fleeing to the wall. But it was useless, the sound of the bomb becoming louder and closer. It ran around everywhere, its hind legs desperately pounding the ground, making sounds of righteousness. Clearly, it had fallen into extreme panic, anger, and terror, and I was more terrified than it. Immediately, disregarding everything, I rushed out the door and jumped into a single-person air raid shelter that looked like a dry well. I don't know if it was because I was selfish or because it didn't understand human language, but I really didn't have time to greet it at the time. I just tensely looked up at the actions of the enemy plane in the air raid shelter. Finally, the bomb came to our yard.</p>
<p>It could be said to be lucky that I had jumped into the air raid shelter in time and was not harmed at all. It could also be said to be unfortunate that a bomb destroyed most of our office buildings. What was even more unfortunate was that the loyal and admirable rabbit had become the only martyr. What was even more regrettable was that when compiling the list of losses, it was impossible to include it. Like it, it can be said to have been born in sorrow, grown up in sorrow, and died in sorrow.</p>
<h3>Magnolia (Oil Painting)</h3>
<p>— Frans Oerder</p>
<h3>Notes on Viewing Paintings</h3>
<p>— Chang Renxia</p>
<p>In current Chinese painting, the school of Xu Beihong injects Western painting methods, while the school of Gao Jianfu injects Japanese painting methods. Due to the influence of foreign painting methods, a new posture has formed in the current stage of Chinese art, differing from traditional conservatives, and thus attracting two different arguments of support and opposition. But as seen by the far-sighted, with the change of the times, changes in art are also inevitable. Chinese painting underwent the greatest changes between the Han and Tang dynasties, all influenced by foreign countries. Although the Song and Yuan dynasties mostly imitated the law, their spirit and appearance were quite different. In modern times, Lang Shining had already opened the end of injecting Western painting methods into Chinese art, but with the current study of Western painting becoming more prevalent, the contamination of Chinese painting by Western winds is becoming more and more intense.</p>
<p>I very much agree with being able to use new painting methods to supplement the shortcomings of old Chinese painting methods. Of course, the advantages of old painting methods should also be diligently inherited. Creating our nation's new art by combining the advantages of world art is precisely the responsibility that Chinese people should bear now. In old painting methods, especially in figure painting, more emphasis is placed on interest and not on resemblance, so that portraits are often stiff and monotonous, becoming something detached from reality. Now, people who have studied Western painting to paint figures, if their skills are quite accomplished, the figures are often lifelike in their expressions, which is very different from the old painting methods.</p>
<p>Recently, I saw the paintings of Mr. Sun Qingyang. Qingyang studied with Zhang Hongwei and Putilsky in his early years and is most proficient in perspective projection. With the foundation of Chinese painting's double-hook method and the techniques of Western painting's sketching, coupled with his keen mind and diligent efforts, he can integrate the strengths of both Chinese and Western styles, creating a rare new style. I especially love his paintings of figures and ladies. One painting of a lotus picker is "The boat moves, the lake is shimmering in autumn, greedy to see the young and trust the boat to flow; for no reason throwing lotus seeds across the water, remotely known by people to be half-day shy." The composition of the poem is symmetrical, and the lotus picker's face, folds of clothing, and fingers are all painted very beautifully. A "Boating" is a picture of Fan Li carrying Xi Shi to tour the Five Lakes, with mountains and rivers, lake light, winding banks, and distant peaks, which makes people feel far away. The former is a representative work of his using Western methods to write figures, and the latter is an excellent achievement of his using perspective to arrange the picture. In addition, he also has a picture of Shushan, writing a mountain of red peach blossoms full of the head, the spring water of the Shu River flows on the mountain, "the red flowers are easy to decline like the meaning of the Lang, the flowing water is endless like the worry of the Nong." The landscape also uses Western methods, creating a unique style, and is working hard to progress upward. It is still difficult to know how high it will develop in the future, but diligence leads to skill, and Qingyang's forever tireless spirit is what those who create new Chinese art should do.</p>
<h3>Homecoming Poem Records</h3>
<p>— Lu Baihua</p>
<p>South Lake Water Chestnut</p>
<p>Gradually, the sharp mountain peak line is in sight, probably what is called "Xushan"! I miss the heroic spirit of Wu Zixu's expedition to Chu passing through here. The light clouds float lightly over the top of the mountain, like setting off the heroic posture of ancient heroes. The water here is beautiful and clear, spreading out smoothly. The car has arrived in Jiaxing.</p>
<p>At the side of the station, there are two relics that form a clever but thought-provoking contrast. On the one hand, the accumulated tombs stand with new monuments, engraved with the merits of those who became benevolent in the War of Resistance. On the other hand, reflecting the tragic situation of the remnants, the traces left by the enemy, the light smoke floating in the morning, touch our tragic situation in a robbery, and a deeper understanding that the militarists will eventually be destroyed, and justice will inevitably be extended. We China has many Wu Zixu!</p>
<p>Suddenly, outside the car window, they shouted to sell Nanhu water chestnuts, made into a plate shape with cattails, full of hornless water chestnuts. Everyone was scrambling to buy them, because this is our country's unique product. The water chestnut is hornless, and the entrance is really fresh, but it is quite expensive. A cattail plate costs two thousand yuan, and the small one costs five hundred yuan. It is said that buying them in Jiaxing city costs only half the price. This shows a corner of our market where we are trying to be clever. I could not avoid the common practice and bought a plate. Chewing the new taste of Nanhu, looking at the lake fields of Huanqiao, water chestnut is growing, and on the left is a green wave. I thought of a few words from the ancients in Yanyu Tower: "The wonderful thing is that the light smoke拂渚, when the mountain rain is about to come, fishing boats and wine barges, are vaguely breaking through the fog." I didn't have the opportunity to take a look, and although there was no smoke and rain on the lake, the battle clouds on the earth were tense again, and it was not yet time to steal a glimpse.</p>
<p>Engraved monuments stand tall to bury loyal bones,</p>
<p>The forts still spit out the smoke of robbery;</p>
<p>Listen to the new taste of Nanhu being sold,</p>
<p>A green water chestnut field surrounds the bridge.</p>
<h3>Sonnet</h3>
<p>— Yuan Wei</p>
<p>My thought, like the Peng bird of the North Sea,</p>
<p>"Ascends ninety thousand miles by swirling wind";</p>
<p>Stuck out from the low and humble nest on the ground,</p>
<p>Leaving me to travel the vast heavenly bodies.</p>
<p>Because I heard that Chang'e lived in the moon,</p>
<p>It chose the first place to visit;</p>
<p>But there was only a relic of the volcano,</p>
<p>No sign of life, too barren!</p>
<p>So it stepped on the road to the sun,</p>
<p>Seeing the infinite flames, too crazy;</p>
<p>One constellation to another constellation,</p>
<p>The harvest of travel made it disappointed.</p>
<p>Finally, still on this piece of land,</p>
<p>It found its home—your heart.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 86</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Walking along this wall is indeed more dangerous, but this open space is too wide, and I want to look at the barracks behind from the jungle, but my eyesight is not enough, and I didn’t bring a telescope. What is the benefit of leaning on the jungle? Moreover, when running across this ten-zhang-wide open space, the target is too obvious. If I reveal my figure, wouldn’t all previous efforts be wasted? At the same time, I don’t want to delay the time and turn back; I will go through the horizontal jungle. But when I thought of what my teacher had said before, "To observe the enemy's situation, if you cannot get close, you must seek to reach the saturation distance." The so-called "saturation distance" refers to the meaning of just being able to break away from the enemy's "alert boundary", and I can still make long-distance observations. Moreover, Tiger Brother's eyesight is extremely strong, and he can also observe subtle details at night, which is equivalent to a telescope.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, I decided to follow Tiger Brother's opinion and riskily cross this open space. Tiger Brother got his consent and immediately leaned over, like an arrow from a bow, and ran over like a wisp of smoke. Five or six zhang away, I saw his figure, like a civet cat, plunged into the shroud of the vast night. After waiting for about three or two minutes, there was no movement. I also leaned over and ran over as quickly as possible. I quietly sent a greeting password, and we gathered together again. While panting, I glanced at it and saw that the jungle here was exactly the same as the arrangement in front. Therefore, I realized that this must be the easternmost boundary of the forbidden area; outside this jungle, there must be a wide road, and outside the road must be a belt of stone walls.</p>
<p>Just as we knew that our panting had just settled down, we were hiding faintly along the jungle, one in front and one behind, walking north, when Tiger Brother suddenly turned around and gave a guard gesture. I hurried forward two steps and squatted down. I was about to ask him, but I had already heard people and dogs barking not far away. At that moment, I pulled Tiger Brother and drilled into the jungle,穿了過去. Sure enough, everything here was just as I had guessed; the road, and the stone wall.</p>
<p>"They're coming," I was lying on the ground, listening intently, and Tiger Brother 附　 my ear　告着, "It's that set again, ... only thirty or forty yards away!"</p>
<p>There is no room for hesitation here for even half a second, and a decision must be made immediately. I gave Tiger Brother a gesture, then leaned over and stepped over the road, took a step to the wall, put my hand on the wall, and looked slightly outside the wall. Seeing that I could still get a foothold, I slipped down. Tiger Brother also followed and crossed the wall. Fortunately, outside the wall here, there is also a slope like the one in the south, and a moat-like stream. Outside the stream, it is vast, presumably a field. I hurried to moisten my fingers, stretched them over my head, and measured the wind direction, knowing that we were in the downwind direction. But under this dull air pressure, where is the wind? It's just some sluggish flow of air.</p>
<p>We could have hid in the jungle to avoid the enemy, so why did we have to cross the stone wall? This was entirely to avoid the dog. After all, there is a six- or seven-foot-high stone wall隔了一層, even if the dog's sense of smell is厲害, the human body's smell can also be isolated somewhat, and it is still downwind. The worrying point is that the patrol inside is much tighter than I had estimated; because it was only a few minutes past eight o'clock, and the previous person had gone north less than half an hour ago, and this one was patrolling south again, then, on average, there would be a round of patrols every half hour. Maybe it's a kind of shuttle double哨? That is to say, two people start from the same place, go in opposite directions, and each绕 one circle, and can return to the station at the same time. This is just a guess of hope.</p>

<h3>Magazines</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>Amid the soaring prices, the struggle of the weak publishing industry is truly a heart-wrenching and heroic scene. They must both survive and take care of readers, and it is difficult for non-insiders to understand their hardships.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the environment is so bad, Shanghai's publishing industry still has amazing results, such as the "See Hear" and "Shanghai Culture" 期刋 is an example. They are serious in their attitude, serious in their work, and it is really exciting.</p>
<p>Regarding "See Hear", I have introduced it before. I am worried that it will be out of date, and now it is still inevitable. In fact, it should have been published as a semi-monthly at the beginning. After ten periods, when there are enough people and the scale is complete, it will not become a problem.</p>
<p>"Shanghai Culture" is worthy of being a very weighty magazine in terms of both content and form. It is progressing one issue at a time, and it will become a good friend of the reading community. Taking the eighth issue as an example, "A Detailed Account of Mr. Yu Dafu's Martyrdom" and the record of the "Symposium on Japanese Issues" are both extremely valuable and rare articles.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a paper-obsessed and gold-obsessed place. To be honest, most people have no intention of reading, especially these two magazines, which are above the level and not popular. That is the phenomenon, 自在意中. Therefore, I would like to contribute a little advice to their presenters, develop inland, and issue with inland as the focus, because inland readers are culturally hungry and desperately need spiritual food.</p>

<h3>France's Zhaojun's Lament</h3>
<p>— Lu Shixiong</p>
<p>The number of American expeditionary soldiers marrying local foreign women is not small in today's war. The romantic affairs of French women have been famous throughout history. There are also many American soldiers who made lifelong alliances with local women in France. These women are not entirely French, but also Belgian, Polish, Czech, Dutch, and other countries, who came here to live to escape the war.</p>
<p>For the sake of proper planning, the French authorities do not want the brides who married American soldiers to flow around like mercury. Before they leave the country, they gather them together and send them to a charitable concentration camp in Orcher, near Paris, for centralized management. Therefore, after marrying American soldiers, they first encounter a soft ban life like a bird entering a cage, replacing the honeymoon trip of love with each other, which is really a big disappointment!</p>
<p>Some women are happy to temporarily endure the pain of soft detention because of their deep love and firm love. But there are also those who temporarily change their minds at the last minute. When they are in a temporary concentration camp outside Paris, many American husbands give comfort and encouragement along the way, and there are also those German prisoners of war who temporarily act as flower protectors, helping the brides to carry their wedding luggage.</p>
<p>On the first night after the 合　, they don't feel happy, not because of the hardship of material enjoyment, but really not used to the dull life in that cage! A woman named Jenny looked out from the wire mesh at the land scenery of her motherland and suddenly felt reluctant to leave, so she terminated the marriage contract at the last minute. Jenny is a French woman. She said: "Rather than going to the United States and then coming back, it is better to cut off a strand of affection with one knife now, which is much more pleasant!"</p>
<p>There is a woman named Mary, but she is different, she is very willing to live with her American husband until old age. In the past, she suffered from disease under the iron hooves of the German army and lived a life of imprisonment for several years. When they were liberated, she met her heroic partner. Now that she has been liberated and will soon be able to go to the gold dollar country of America, she will temporarily have to relive the old lesson of detention. Old grievances and new sorrows make her cry and laugh. There was a pistol hidden in Mary's small suitcase, and it was found and confiscated by the guards when she entered the concentration camp. At that time, she was crying like "a branch of pear blossoms with spring rain." She said: "This is a souvenir for my eye protection." Although the guards believed and sympathized, they still confiscated it in accordance with the regulations for safety.</p>
<h3>Beginning of Democracy</h3>
<p>— A Grain of Rice</p>
<p>Who says the common people are useless? Just look at the councilors of Hangzhou City. There is actually a rickshaw puller named Zhao Tingxiu among them. From this, we can see that the common people have finally raised their heads and been liberated from the traditional concepts under the feudal system of thousands of years. Although that is only a small beginning, how can the current turbulent ocean rivers be formed without the original droplets of rain? Especially on the eve of the upcoming National Assembly, recalling the great hope of the Father of the Nation's will to "return power to the people" makes it shine like a moving sunrise.</p>
<p>We earnestly hope that this trend can spread to every local council in the country.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, we still cannot help but eagerly hope for the general improvement of the people's education level. Otherwise, the participation of farmers and workers in politics will inevitably be merely a formality!</p>

<h3>Who Stole the Money?</h3>
<p>— Jia Jin</p>
<p>Mr. H. Cady borrowed a long-term copy of "Industrial Engineering Chemistry" from a library in Wisconsin. The library stipulates that the borrowing time should not exceed one month, otherwise a fine of one dollar will be charged. Later, Mr. Cady traveled to Tennessee and did not return. His servant, Brown, received a reminder notice. When Cady returned home, he remembered this and gave Brown one U.S. dollar, instructing him to return the book quickly. A week later, the library sent another notice saying: "Although the book has been delivered from the post office, the fine draft has not been received." Cady asked Brown about this, saying: "What exactly happened?" Brown replied: "A week ago, because he thought the remittance was too small and the procedures were too complicated, he simply clipped the U.S. dollar between pages 53 and 54 of the book and sent it by mail." After speaking, he even presented the post office registered receipt as proof. Cady thought hard for a long time, unable to figure out who took the money. During his afternoon nap, he picked up a copy of Reader's Digest from the bookshelf. While reading, he suddenly realized that the money must have been taken by the servant Brown and not sent out. Smart readers: Can you guess what the Reader's Digest told him?</p>
<p>The answer will be revealed tomorrow</p>
<h3>Yin Rugeng Died Too Late</h3>
<p>— Wu Shujiang</p>
<p>The great traitor of North China, Yin Rugeng, has been sentenced to death. In fact, the death of the traitor Yin was already determined in 1936. It can be said that he had a hard life, stirring up trouble for another ten years and doing a shameful career that disgraced his ancestors and humiliated his descendants.</p>
<p>In 1936, an anonymous "extraordinary woman," seeing the traitor Yin recognizing the enemy as his father, acting tyrannical, and oppressing the people, was extremely angry and decided to eliminate the traitor. At that time, Yin's security was tight, and there was no way to kill him. So, she condescended to befriend a certain captain of Yin's guards, secretly entering his room. Unfortunately, she failed to achieve her goal and was discovered. The extraordinary woman and the captain of the guards were both killed. Later, Yin added dozens of Japanese bodyguards to his entourage.</p>
<p>Ten years have passed, and the time for Yin's death has arrived. The extraordinary woman, if she is conscious in the afterlife, should also rest in peace?</p>

<h3>A Wild Idea</h3>
<p>— Wu You</p>
<p>Reading "The End of the World"</p>
<p>After reading the allegory "The End of the World" (published in the November 1st issue of this publication) under the lamp, I was extremely moved, almost unable to restrain myself. Thank goodness, "The End of the World" says that after that catastrophe, there was still a man with reproductive ability left in the world. It left a glimmer of hope for humanity. The "allegory" ends with a series of mysterious "..." which contains unspeakable words and boundless emotion and feelings! I couldn't help but be moved and fantasize about this series of mysterious "...", and even fell asleep while holding the newspaper. I had a dream all night:</p>
<p>From that time on, newspapers all over the world competed to publish news about that man in long headlines every day; magazines and publications in various countries also often used most of their pages to record it. The man's name was already known to every household in the world; in fact, that man had become a common hope, a sun, a god for all mankind.</p>
<p>That man attracted the attention of the whole world and became an unprecedented major point of contention in the international community! Everyone hoped to snatch that man, so that their own country and nation would not become extinct and could even control the world.</p>
<p>This situation continued, endlessly; there was a great sense of imminent danger. It made all mankind panic all day long, preparing to meet the unprecedented massacre that was about to come. At that time, Americans were naturally more anxious than people from other countries, because the only man with reproductive ability in the world belonged to the United States. In order to prevent problems before they happen, the United States had to stand up and call for the reorganization of a new international organization to specifically study and discuss this unprecedentedly serious world problem—how all mankind can share that man.</p>
<p>I don't know how many times of discussions, disputes, and crises that were just a breath away from turning into a complete falling out. Finally, an agreement was barely reached, and a "Great Charter for the Continuation of Human Life" was established.</p>
<p>Just as people were joyfully celebrating the new hope that this "Great Charter" brought to mankind, a new problem broke out! - Perhaps because those diplomats were all confused from arguing, the "Great Charter" actually omitted a section about the procedures for that man to travel to various countries in the future! Which should come first?</p>
<p>This new problem has once again brought international relations to a standstill! It suddenly made all mankind lose their color. After several rounds of negotiations, all sorts of methods were devised: some advocated following the geographical shape, starting from the United States, and proceeding sequentially around the world; some advocated following the order of large, medium, and small countries; some advocated going in alphabetical order of country names; all kinds of proposals were resolutely overturned by those countries ranked later. Finally, everyone had to come up with a method of deciding by drawing lots. But who should preside over the drawing of lots? This was another difficulty!</p>
<p>When the lottery date arrived, someone proposed a veto, saying that the organizer had malpractices. The two international groups still couldn't give way to each other, and some people were trying to reproduce humans by scientific methods. Everyone was confident and unafraid of each other.</p>
<p>Several years later, that one and only male god did not produce a second generation, and those dreaming scientists did not create scientific humans either.</p>
