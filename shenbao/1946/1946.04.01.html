<h3>實施土地新政芻議（下）</h3>
<p>— 陶啓沃</p>
<p>勝利來得太突然，一切復員準備工作，時間上都感到似乎迫促而趕不上。勝利以後的局面，各地方政治軍事演變情形，又非我人事先所能逆料。當然，在把握時間上說，應一面接收，一面即行根據國民黨的土地政策，頒佈緊急法令，調劑人地分配，實施土地革命。但事實上全國各地狀况，很有出入，我人爲解決當前問題，不能漠視現實，必當因地制宜，就各種情形不同地區，在一個政策之下（由耕者有其田到土地國有），分別規定可以順利推行之辦法。依作者所見，全國實施土地革新，應劃分爲三大地區，此三大地區所採取之方法，不必一律。共地區大別如下：</p>
<p>（甲）原在敵僞控制下之接收區域；</p>
<p>（乙）大後方自由區；</p>
<p>（丙）特別區（包括停止衝突地區—用「政治協商會議」的名稱—以及共黨所謂的游擊區，曁舊時敵後政權區）。</p>
<p>（甲）以上第一種地區，接收於敵僞控制之下。此種地區，均為沿江沿海，交通方便，人煙稠密，地權碎割之區。各該地區淪陷期間不同，有爲犬牙交錯之戰區，則人民流亡，地籍散失，已大部變爲荒蕪。有些則淪陷日久，敵僞已建立新的秩序，歷有年數，地權已經過一再移轉。其業主與土地發生之關係，不外下列四種：（一）爲有契據有經界者；（二）爲有契據無經界者；（三）爲無契據有經界者；（四）爲無契據無經界者。</p>
<p>收復區域地方政權奠定之時，應由地政主管機關會同當地公正士紳（未附逆逆者），立即組設地權評議委員會，就全縣土地所有權，重新評議。各業主應於規定公吿期限以內，到會聲請登記審議，委員會接得申請，應就左列標準，分別處理；</p>
<p>（一）對於有契據有經界之業主，倘査明該契據係淪陷以前，地方合法主管機關發給，或經登記有案者，則准予承認其所有權。如其土地被人强佔，委員會應即裁定發還原業主。倘持有契據而係僞政府發給或核備者，則應令提出當地正當人士或舖保，證明其所有權之取得係經過合法手續而並無掠奪行爲者，亦予承認。（二），（三）有契據無經界者及有經界無契據者，應令原業主提出經界及契據證明或祖保，經過審査與公吿程序，無疑義後，亦可確認其所有權。如被人非法侵佔，亦即勒令歸還。</p>
<p>以上土地發還原業主，或確認原業主所有權後，其所有權之行使，應受下開限制：（1）不准自由增加佃租。（2）不准自由撤佃。（3）田畝不准超過一定限度，超過部分即由地權評議委員會予以徴收。（4）照上述標準發還或確認原業主所有之土地，如過分碎割或零星分散，不便耕作者，評議委員會應令各業主會商，以交換分合方法，集中通成一片，以利耕作。但土地有肥瘠不同，交換分合時，受益較多之一方，應比照時値，補償受損之一方。（5）在淪陷期間，佃農或雇農對於地主如負有債務者，應由評議委員會裁定，予以合理减輕或豁免。</p>
<p>（四）至於第四種無經界無契據之土地，以及不合（一）（二）（三）三項規定可以確定業主所有權之土地，徴收超過之土地，戰區荒廢之土地，沒收自敵僞之土地，應即一律由評議委員會接管，以鄕鎭爲單位，按計口授田方法，分配左列人員耕作。其優先程序，依如下之序列：1.本鄉流亡人民來歸者。2.退役軍人。3.籍隷本鄕之公敎人員。（公敎人員本人，縱或在外工作，其家屬應有分配權利，使農事仕學，打成一片，且公敎人員生活，一時不易改善，授田使其家屬耕作，可以養廉，以爲澄淸史治减少貪汚之一助）。計口授田，均以自耕爲主，並規定有終身使用權，切實作到「耕者有其田」。</p>
<p>（乙）大後方自由區。八年苦戰，大後方軍糧民食，供應無缺，不能不歸功於大部分農民胼手胝足，辛苦耕稼之結果。在抗戰過程中，糧價追隨物價，步步上漲，坐令地主不勞而獲，收益增多。實際上眞正耕作之佃農雇農，本身餘糧，往往不足供一年食用，每當靑黃不接之際，便以高利貸入款項度日，待新榖登塲，即以低價抵債，因此生活終不易改善。在地主方面，抗戰以來，雖然征實征購，盡力輸將，亦大有功於國家，然而因緣時會，坐致巨利，使財富更形集中，社會財富分配更不均勻，自非政府所能漠視。調整之法，自應援土地法立法原則，以溫和手段，切實有效的執行下列辦法：</p>
<p>（一）加重地價稅，使地價跌落，予個農買田機會。</p>
<p>（二）實行二五減租，使地主收獲，不得超過耕地正產物收益總額千分之三百七十五。此點如能嚴格實施，地價料可跌落，予佃農以崠出機會。</p>
<p>（三）實行限田制度，各戶所有田數，不得超過一定限額。逾限之數，徴收高額累進稅，防杜土地過度集中。如地主將田出賣，則承佃人有廉價優先購買之權。</p>
<p>（四）保護佃農之承佃權與永佃權，使業主不能隨時撤佃。佃農獲有確切保障，方能盡力改善其土地。</p>
<p>（五）大後方各地，除四川中部和東南部，到處墾作，對於土地，可謂已盡相當利用外，他如黔·滇·陜·甘·新·靑·各省，童山濯濯，荒地處處，政府自應將裁餘官兵，公敎人員及其家屬，分配屯墾，或招代墾人投資從事開藝。墾熟以後，予代墾人以相當利益，而後逐漸償還其所投之資。</p>
<p>（六）徴收不在地主之土地，分配退伍官兵，公教人員，或其家屬耕作。以上接收區域及大後方自由區，都是相當的承認土地私有權，但加以溫和的限制。照此實施，則不耕而穫之地主，其所得將日少，自須逐漸出售其土地，以投資於工商業？大地主自動淘汰絕跡，同時有耕作能力者，可以有取得土地之機會，不需要以暴力達到目的。國父遺敎：「耕者有其田』，自可充分做到。</p>
<p>（丙）特別區。特區土地，一部分已經重分配，一部分則爲日本投降後，新擴展之地區，分配關係似亦在轉移中。對此區內土地處理，究應承認其現在制度，抑或再加調整，要須視「協商」得到如何結果，方能決定辦法。惟該區所採，似純係土地國有制度。所有官僚·軍閥·豪紳·地主·祠堂·廟宇·會產·及富農等土地，統已沒收，重行分配於雇農·貧農·中農·工人·士兵·或其家屬。考土地公有理論，本爲國父遺敎及一般學者所承認，惟彼此所採手段，互不相同。現今事實上各該地區阡陌經界，已完全破壞，原來地主恐已早不存在，大多數土地已採集體經營方式，恢復原狀，不可能亦不必要。最好從積極方面想辦法，在此種地區，應該積極發展農田水利，提倡科學經營，如改良土壤防災除害，擴充使用土地機械力，使耕作效率達到最高，因而可以最省之人力，收獲最大之生產。從而使大家認識，公營國營與集體合作經營之效率與收穫，確較個人有狹小耕地面積上自耕爲優。如此造成風氣，獲得農民普遍信仰，則不必以强力督促，大家會自動朝此方向走。</p>
<p>以上三種地區，採取方法各別，然而殊途同歸（耕者有其田——土地國有），最後的目的還是一樣的。</p>
<p>土地爲人類生活所必需。我人衣食住行，直接間接，無不出自土地。解決土地問題得當，人民衣食之源無缺，然後方能談工業建設，促使社會進步，經濟繁榮。使解決不得其法，土地不能獲得有效使用與合理分配，則壟斷地利與荒廢地方之結果，必致釀成社會不平，阻滯經濟生活之進步。國父說過：「建國之首要在民生」。實行民生主義，必以平均地權爲前提。地盡其利，則廣大農村，可以安定，農業生產可以增加，工業原料方不缺乏。農民生活水準提高，購買力增强，工業成品方有廣大市塲可以消化。而農村秩序安定繁榮，治安無虞，允爲工業建設普遍展開之先決條件。所以平均地權與工業建設，必需同時並進，相輔相成。建國大業，始克有濟。吾則畸重畸輕，偏榮偏枯，結果必一無所成。現在戰事勝利，國內政治協商成功，吾人希望政府把握時機，於籌劃整個工業建設之同時，根據民生主義土地政策，及六全大會曁二中全會的先後決議，速下股大決心，適時解決土地問題。（完）</p>

<h3>進出口貿易大難　原因殊多，不易圖利　商人多存觀望　外貨遲遲未到不勝利息負擔　生絲出口多虧本豬鬃十九遭退了回</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者頃訪本市進出口業某鉅子，叩以本市進出口業一般情形。承吿：此次我國外匯開放，爲日不久；進出口業又恢復伊始，各方面不無生疏及困難之感。進口方面之困難，例如：（一）各指定銀行對進出口商所需之外匯頭寸，未能儘量供給。（二）國外駛華之船隻，船期多不能確定。（三）工業及其他必需品，國外亦缺乏現貨，故一批定貨，往往爲時四五個月，尙無到滬之確訊。職是之故，本市進口商中，對進口貿易，頗有抱觀望態度者。諒以木市暗息甚高，向國外定貨時，必須繳足貨款全部。今如定貨四五個月不能抵埠，則鉅額利息之負祖，即使定貨將來抵垾，是否仍屬有利可圖，頗成疑問。出口方面，亦有困難：（一）土產物品，戰後品質漸低，不合國外需要之水準。（二）各地運輸情形，尙未恢復，土產運滬，相當困難。據稱最近出口品中，以生絲及猪鬃佔大宗。前者出口後，多遭虧本。後者則以品質不合標準，十九均遭退回。故甚望今後之出口品，應先經我商品檢騐局檢騐合格，再行出口。同時並望能與美商協議，出口品以我商品檢騐局騐訖爲標準，以免發生檢騐標準之爭執云。</p>

<h3>浦江建橋問題　施孔懷談話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國橋樑專家茅以昇氏，對本市正擬興建中之橫跨浦江大橋，發表意見，略謂假使在中正路外灘起造高橋，則橋堍勢必要從大世界前開始……，如造隧道式，也以上海沙灘太深，在水面下九百多尺才碰到石頭，與造高橋同樣的困難。茅氏的結論，認爲暫時只能造個活動平橋，在規定時間內開放橋樑中間部份，以便艦船通過云云。」按浦江兩岸直接交通，關於發展上海商港及開發浦東區極爲重要，各方咸極注意此問題。昨本報記者晤我國港務專家施孔懷氏，據施氏談：「中正路外灘以南浦江兩岸，原有不少渡輪，但究覺未能隨時通行，對航行亦不無阻礙之處。現上海不特爲吾國之最大商埠，且爲世界巨港之一，他日發展正未可限量，凡有妨碍航行，正宜儘量避免，故在中正路外灘建造平橋，似應詳加考慮。至於隧道不必建在石頭之上，例如紐的荷蘭隧道，穿過赫特生河，建築於河底之泥砂中，該隧道最深處平均自高水面至隧道底約一百叧一呎半，固無需在水面下深至九百多呎也。隧道建築費，雖較高橋爲貴，然其對水陸交通之便利，亦遠勝於高橋，尤其在國防上更有安全保障之價値，願供當局硏究」云。</p>

<h3>衛生當局　垃圾不怕多　廢物好利用</h3>
<p>— ……本報訊得　蒼龍</p>
<p>你討厭拉圾麽？可是上海偏多的是垃圾！你要不信的話，錢市長，前天在市參議會上的報吿，會使你發怔。他說市府接收之初，市區各街道垃圾，達一萬餘噸，經主管當局督飭淸除，半年來共計淸除垃圾卅八萬二千六百六十一噸！</p>
<p>那來這許多垃圾，誰去收檢呢？又怎樣的處置呢？藏在象牙塔裏的都市兒女們，也許注意不到這些「芝蔴般的小事」。可是衛生局設：他們爲了淸除垃圾，特地設立了淸潔總隊。總隊以下，分了八個中隊。每個中隊，担任了一個警區的工作。</p>
<p>據統計：本市每天的垃圾產量，在一千六百噸至三千噸之間，耶誕和新年節日的幾天，垃圾的產量，更多得可怕。怎麼辦呢？只有督促淸道夫和垃圾夫加緊工作了。現在每天出動的淸道夫有三千多人，這數量比勝利前，增加了三分之一。這批都市垃圾的淸除者，在每淸早六點半，就要到各工作站點卬（點名的意思），不到七點半，他們都已到達工作的目的地，執行起淸除的任務來。十一時半到一時半之間，是他們午膳的時間。過此，他們又要一直工作到四時半或五時才停下手來。每一天每個淸道夫大的担任一公里長以內垃圾的掃除，每個垃圾夫大的祖任三十十隻大小垃圾箱垃圾的收集，運輸，和處理。</p>
<p>可是，還有許多人家，常把垃圾傾到在馬路上。衛生局決定在今年五月一日以前，要呌都市裏每家居戶，預備一個裝垃圾的容器。每天在一定的時間中，有衛生局專派的垃圾車准過搖鈴收集。</p>
<p>目前處理垃圾的辦法，不脫塡海，塡　，焚毁三種。大部份的垃圾，都是由垃圾船運送到浦東三林塘附近曠地暫堆。這些處理辦法，衛生局認爲都陳舊了，他們因此計劃了一個澈底而根本的淸除辦法。預備把都市的垃圾，分爲五大類：（一）動物性類像肉骨魚骨等，（二）植物性類像菜根樹皮等，（三）布條紙屑類，（四）鐵罐廢聽類，（五）煤渣泥灰類。垃圾經過這種分析工作後，大部份都可變成有用的東西。怎樣變呢？</p>
<p>第二類的垃圾相當多，每天單就全市二十七個菜塲所搜集來的植物性垃圾，已經相當可觀。衛生局打算把這一類的垃圾，集中到一塊廢公墓的地方，讓它腐蝕，照化學原理，可產生大量CH4，也就是可以燃燒的沼氣。這樣一來，旣可利用沼氣的燃燒，來焚燬不必要的垃圾，更將用沼氣的燃燒，來製造蒸氣。把第三類的垃圾布條紙屑等，熔化成紙漿，製造再生紙。這是一個由垃圾而生產物資的動聽計劃，說來會使你不信。不過衛生局已經在積極推進中，希望能在本年內予以實現。</p>
<p>初步計劃，據說將利用全市的保甲機構，互助合作。衛生局將一方面設法在各處安置五種垃圾容器，督責專人把垃圾先行分類，然後分別提供處理。</p>
<p>不能否認的，南市還是垃圾堆積最多的地方。衛生局說：現在已決心加以全面處理，而以南市的邑廟區，爲淸除垃圾的起點。現在已召集該區的耆老領袖，會商淸除的辦法。</p>
<p>偌大的一個都市，飯店菜館儘管毘接鄰銜，可是全市的公厠，却只有二百十七隻，離開實際的需要太遠了。現在據說要再添二百隻，其中八十八隻預備在年內吿成，小便處最近也要添建十個。</p>
<p>你討厭垃圾麽？不盡然了吧！莫埋沒了垃圾！天下本無厥物，要在看人怎樣的去利用它。可是，要是你定要製造許多垃圾的話，切記得把它倒進自己的垃圾桶裏，那末縱使你不利用它，它還會受到公家的利用　便沒用的垃圾沒用再變成有用的物責。</p>
<h3>龍華道上　仕女如雲</h3>

<h3>改善中區交通綫　增加雙行快車道</h3>
<p>市政當局自實行金陵路南京東路一段禁駛卡車塌車後，交通狀况雖略見改善，惟中區行車擁擠現象，仍未稍減。茲悉當局爲改善交通擁擠，以策安全起見，今日起實施下列新措施：福州路自中山東路至河南路間，改爲雙行快車道，在每日上午八時至下午八時內，僅准機動車行駛，其他車輛一律禁止在該段通過。至南京東路至黃陂北路，在下午二時前仍限機動車行駛。</p>

<h3>上週金鈔市況平疲　證券投機獨盛　食糧市價漸次平落</h3>
<p>上週各業趨勢尙稱平穩，惟一部份游資未有正常發展，仍在投機性各黑市買賣中活動，食米市况初以天雨關係，來源較稀，貨主扳抬，白粳盤於三萬二千元左右，後因天時放晴，到貨頓多，一致疲落，週末白粳跌至二萬八千元，棉紗因客帮需胃孔多，價又趨俏，布市脚地頗軟，惟府綢以及花布，因當令，價頗堅定，茲分述如次；</p>
<p>烚赤　因月底關係，迫於銀根者頻有吐出，加以中行配價不動，續呈疲勢，週初在一六〇萬左右，嗣即步步挫落，至週六下午曾退入一五〇萬關內，爲一四九五〇〇，終站一五〇萬元。</p>
<p>統債　謠傳紛起，游資泛濫，當局雖在査禁，黑市依然犯獗，統債市價冉冉向上，週二以某巨空大量拋賣，稍見回小，週三逢低買勢又濃，似再吿騰踊，丙種出三千元關，週四因有空頭不能交割陷入停頓狀態，但零星交易仍在拉抬，迄於週六，丙種一路俏至三千四，其餘略回。</p>
<p>外幣　美匯二〇二〇元未史，美鈔無有進步，故始終盤於二千元內，港幣因投機份子獲利後，漸有吐出，一度下下挫，老貨山四三五元曾低至四一五元，新貨曾小至二百關邊，週六稍堅，終比前週各小二三十元。</p>
<p>股票　週初華股略形恍惚，外股賣戶踵接，惟鋼業獨俏，週三華股買氣大盛，行市節節推進，創空前高峯，外股受華股在漲之影響，亦見抬俏，翌日債市發生糾紛，又値假期前夕，業中咸存心觀望，華股初見平定，中途回落，惟三小型股昂騰特多，外股供求不一，漲跌參差，週末大型華股搜購有人，價再上升，小型股新光則稍下挫，餘無變化，外股人心振奮，一致昂騰，紙業升起更多。</p>
<p>現紗　在上週間，初開趨勢極平庸，嗣後廣東帮實際需要不絕，尤以週六採辦爲最暢，且有即刻裝運消息，是以新買與補空殊形踴躍，而新賣戶則較爲缺乏，形呈求過於供之勢，全週以星期六之六十支日光細紗二百八十五萬爲最商，比前週暴漲二十萬之多，廿支特雙馬漲九萬次之，十支童子軍漲十一萬，其餘各紗扯漲三五萬不等。</p>

<h3>世界茶荒　美人不滿劣等茶</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦三十一日電〕目前世界各國，尤其美國人士，均以劣等茶充斥於市，頗感不滿。各國需要數量雖均增加，但聯合國糧食局對於來年之分配數量並無大增加。作爲非主要食品之國家，其配給量祇及戰前消耗量之半數，但英國及美之供給數量並未大减。在荷屬柬印度及其他東方解放地區能每年輸出二萬萬磅以前，茶葉之配給及統制似無取消之希望。但欲達到此項數字，至少須在荷印局勢平定以後兩年。據估計荷印產茶區的三分之一，已被破壞或荒廢，不堪種植云。</p>

<h3>生產建設應重視的　出口商品的增產</h3>
<p>— 王乃益</p>
<p>本文作者王乃益先生對於經濟會計研究甚深，著作豐富，現除担任各界會計顧問外，並担任振興茶業公司總會計，本篇所述，確屬針對現實。—編者</p>
<p>我國在國際貿易上，向來稱爲入超國家，抗戰以後全國通商口岸全部淪陷對外往來除軍用必需外，其他商品幾乎全部停止出口。所以抗戰期間，對外貿易全部頻於停頓狀態。勝利以還，各方都在喊着恢複對外貿易的口號，要知入超狀態雖爲工業幼稚國家所不能避免，但圖諜减少入超數字，則不但爲政府當局所應加以注視，即全國四萬萬五千萬人民都宜知所挽救，當茲抗戰初定；百廢待舉，需要國外物資及各種製造機械之帮助，期待允殷；此時欲談減低入超，談何容易！其唯一方法，祇有增強生產，大量增加有形貨物之輸出，以挽救有形貨物的入超，至於平衡國際收支之其他對策，尙有數種無形的，容當另文介紹，此刻筆者擬略述一些瞼前對外有形出口貿易概况：</p>
<p>迥溯民國十餘年至二十年期間，貿易數字均甚平靜，通扯均在十數億元左右；迄至二十一年起，因受世界不景氣潮流影響，及東北之被佔等因素的牽動，貿易數字便覺極大的减少，的有减去半數之譜。所以二十三四年以後出口貿易數，僅有四五億元之細微數額而已。</p>
<p>又按我國出口貨物，向以原料爲大宗，足以顯示農業國家對外貿易之天然特性。自從東北被侵，我國喪失出口貿易佔三分之一的農產大地，所以甘二年以後的出口數字，原料便退落第二位；而製造品却一躍而升居出口商品之第一位；飲食品則更退落爲第三位。其中製造品之躍升，並不能爲國家稱慶，因其數量並未增加，且最重要因素的農村破產，農事不振所造成，筆者於此特予指明，以免被認爲工業進步，而怏爲我國已升居工業先進國家？豈不謬乎。</p>
<p>上列所稱之製造品類，如棉布；棉紗，生絲及綢緞等，原料類如棉，羊毛，繭，固液兩體燃料，生牛皮，礦砂，種子，及油等；飲食品類如米，雜糧豆麵粉，糖，菜蔬，水菓，亮菓，糖菓，牲畜，肉類，蛋製品，漁製品，鹽，茶，酒，及烟草等，其中細目數字，當推油類，茶葉，棉紗，生絲等爲最鉅，依農工業生產品類而分，則農產品仍居絕對多數。</p>
<p>我國欲求輸出量之增高，必非大規模促進前列各種商品之生產，尤其農產物品不能爲功。蓋此刻欲求促進製造品生產，而與先進國家競爭，似覺時間尙嫌過平。以我國工業之幼稚，加以之數年的抗戰，有如重病初見痊愈之表弱身軀，何能與工業昌盛，科學發達，機器萬能的國家，互相抗衡，所以目下最適常最坦白的批評，工業製造的生產，能自給自足，不被洋貨傾銷，已算上上大吉。至於發展製造品外銷，尙須經過相當時日；且農業生產，向爲我國出口特徵，自不可聽其不振狀態，永久遺存，故增加有形出口貨，應以農品為首要目標。</p>
<p>近聞友人自美返國者談及，各國機械工業發達之程度，可使我國再費數十年之努力，尙難望其項背。即以現下各國移贈我國之軍用或商用機器，船隻，及瞼艦導論之，多爲各國過時不適用之廢物，吾國尙視之爲名貴珍品，聞之不無滿心。</p>
<p>雖然我國各種事業程度低得如此地步，但並非沒有救藥！一方面應從培養人才，增添機械，及改良增進各種生產着手？另一方面，則應發揚我國固有天然資源，努力增產，以挽國際貿易地位。所以筆者認爲討論生產建設問題，應喚醒大家對於農業生產，寄以極大的注視，庶幾出口貿易，可不至捨本逐末，而墮人危險途徑。蔣主席在變十國慶日廣播演詞中，曾提及經濟建設方針，應以農業與工業並重；並指出工業的進步，必須以農業的發達爲基礎。筆者於二月廿五日在本報，曾申述農業重要部門的茶農生產槪况，其與國計民生關係之重，已可概見；其他農產亦可類推而知矣。筆者在本文貢獻的意見，亦在求農業與工業並重，不過認爲振興國外貿易，應先增進農業生產。至於工業生產則宜先着重國內經營，以抵制外貨進口爲第一要務；其後再逐漸推展至南洋，並擴至歐美各地，如此方可說是，內外兼顧，農工並車的最切實辦法。</p>
<p>最後，筆者除希望政府及金融機關，切實協助執行低利貸放，减輕產品成本，加强輸運能力，添購新式機械，及培養技術管理人才等要務外；並頒佈獎勵出口商品增產辦法，及獎勵出口貿易辦法，酌免一部外銷品關稅，及運輸費用，健量承做出口押匯，以促進出口行商資金周轉之圓滑；並盡量便利出口結關之手續；同時更望產業界對於出口佔重要地位之農業品，特別注意，大量投資，盡力設法挽救各種困難，達到所期望的農業增產之最終目標。完成出口重要商品的大量輸出，國際市塲的復興，入超赤色數字的减少，與外匯籌碼的爭取，均深利賴之也。</p>
<h3>生產建設與樂業</h3>
<p>— 姚思偉</p>
<p>在現時代的社會，一切突飛猛進，與以前是大不相同了。那麼將來的後生小子，要立身處世，發跡成功，更是一件不易的事。因爲愈進步得快，愈競爭得厲害。我們要在這進步不已的社會裏，很困難的求到了一個立身的機會，更進一步，要能够達到成功的目的。那麼，我們先要明白怎樣才會成功呢？</p>
<p>一個成功的材料，是缺不了智識，經騐，修養，努力，更少不了要有樂業的基礎心理，所謂樂業乃指對於本業的愛好視爲終身職業，樂而不疲，任怨任勞，皆所不顧。世界上工商名人，大都由樂業心理所造成。他們孜孜競競天天勇往直前，一些也不存苟安心理，不時的奮鬥，如是雖任何難關，必能打破。我國工商業落後，更應具有樂業的心理，不特對於個人的成就有密切的關係，抑且對於國家經濟的枯榮，也有相當影蠻。</p>
<p>雖然在過去的幾年之中，我想也有僥倖獲致成功，而成爲大富之賈。在敵僞時代，一切都是不正常的，可是以後絕對不會有僥倖而獲致成功的。我們要知道，僥倖心理爲事業成功的黑影，萬萬不可再存在我們的腦裏，要把僥倖心理，視爲成功的障礙物。在現時代中，大家起來，人盡其才，學盡其用的向進步的社會裏衝出去，來做一個不易獲得的成功者。且於生產建設，亦能收到了良好的效果。</p>
<h3>工商管理概論</h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>（三）人才問題</p>
<p>無論什麽事，要求成功，都需要有適當的人才，所謂「事在人爲」是一點也不錯的，在事業的經營上，更需要有人才。</p>
<p>這一次經過八年的抗戰，有許多人才，已經離開了他們的本業，改變了他們的職業，有許多本來具備相當道德的人才，因爲環境不良，而成爲不良的份子，所以八年以來人才祇有减少，沒有增多，爲今後的發展計，人才的培養，實在是刻不容緩的事。</p>
<p>根據管理的原則，一個完善的管理人才，必須具備下列的成份，可以作爲培植人才或選拔人才的參考：</p>
<p>一，志氣：一個人要求進步，先要具備志氣，自已希望能够做到那一步，就應該及早具備那種志氣，美國烟草公司的創辦人多克在年幼的時候，帮助他的父親整理烟葉，那時候他就感覺到烟草事業是很有發展的，於是立志要從這一方面發展，結果因爲他先具備了志氣，再經過不斷的努力，終於是成功了。</p>
<p>二，學識：一個人的學識是間接或直接所得到的經騎的積聚，當我們加人一個事業，開始服務的時候，我們就應該隨時留意，凡是我們能够接觸到的事物，都應該加以硏究。</p>
<p>三，創造的精神：凡是具有管理才能的人，大都是具有創造的精神的，見到應該改革的事情，就去加以改。革從前有一個人在芝加哥一家百貨商店裏購買柬西，正在等待貨品包紮，看見一個年輕的職員，走到部長那裏，建議對於那一個部份的排列有改革的必要，並且說明了改革的方法，那當時的情形，使他得到很深的印象，那一個年輕的職員，後來就是倫敦最大的百貨商店的主人哥登　飛爾奇。</p>
<p>四，透澈：要担起重大的事務，一個人就應該能够把各種事物做得非常透澈，觀察得無微不至，工作得盡善盡美，一個能够把事情做得透澈的人，方始能够負起較大的責任。</p>
<p>五，分析的力量：這一點與第四點有一點相仿，有許多未曾經過訓練的管理人才，在判斷事情的時候，都照着事情的表面，並不深究事情的詳細情形，如果是一個眞正有本領的管理人才，那末常他要解決一件事情的時候，他一定要詳加分析，看到事情的各方面—好的方面和壞的方面—以及種種利害的關係。</p>
<p>六·判斷力：有了分析的力量，如果沒有判斷的能力，那末事情仍舊不能進行，有時候要錯過許多很好的機會，尤其在現代，一切事情必須在最短的時期中取決，所以如果沒有判斷的能力，就不能有迅速的取決，小則躭誤事務，大則誤了事業的大計。</p>
<p>七·組織的能力：一個事業，既然不是一個人或是一個單獨的部份可以進行的，所以一個負責的當局，一定要有組織的能力，使各個部份，能够通力合作，事務的進行非常順利，而同事間的感情，又非常融洽。</p>
<p>八·具體的理想：一個人的理想，是他進步的首要條件，如果沒有理想，就不會有什麼進步，但是他的理想應該是其體的，否則就沒有實現的可能。</p>
<p>九·適應環境的能力：一個管理人才，必須有過應環境的能力，因爲。在他的面前，」一忽兒堆滿着許多文件，急待處理，忽兒又要應付外來的客人，如果他沒有適應環境的能力，那末他一定要弄得手忙腳亂，毫無秩序，並且也足以影響他的判斷能力</p>
<p>十·領袖的才能：這與組織的才能有相連的關係，一個管理人才，必須具有一種做領袖的手腕，他能够指揮別人去實行他的主張，並且能够和他們合作起來，共同處理事務的進行。</p>
<p>十一·優美的風度：在現代的各種環境裏，印象是非常重要的，一個人如果能够給人良好的印象，對於他自身的進步和事務的進行，是很有帮助的，要具有優美的風度，必須具備强健的體格，和待人接物的優良的禮儀。</p>
<p>十二·應用各種原理的才能：做一個管理的人才，必須要能够應用各種原理，因爲要把一個事業發揚光大，處處地方，要有合理的處置，如果沒有應用原理的才能，那末往往容易憑着個人的意氣用事，不會獲得成功。</p>

<h3>National Army Marches North and Enters Siping Street, Advancing Towards Changchun; Communist Army Also Sends Reinforcements to Strengthen Encirclement</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping Thirty-first Dispatch] The National Army, which marched north from Shenyang on the afternoon of the 28th, has already entered Siping Street, which was previously captured by the Communist Army, and the main force is continuing to advance towards Changchun.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Beiping Thirty-first Dispatch] The race between the Nationalists and Communists to seize Changchun seems to have reached an extremely fierce level today. News from Shenyang and Changchun both state that the vanguard of the National Army has reached Changtu, 100 li south of Changchun, while Communist reinforcements have strengthened the encirclement of this important northeastern city. The situation within Changchun City is extremely unfavorable for government officials due to the infiltration of the Communist Army. Yesterday, the Soviet authorities permitted eleven army transport planes, piloted by Chinese pilots, to carry Chinese officials from Changchun to Jinzhou.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping Thirty-first Dispatch] Although the Executive Headquarters has arrived in the Northeast, some strategies for resolving the Northeast issue are still being discussed by the Military Three-Person Group in Chongqing. People here feel that mediation in the Northeast is no less difficult than in North China. It is also rumored that Zhang Qun will come north to replace Zhang Zhizhong.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Beiping Thirty-first Dispatch] The Executive Headquarters of Mediation received a report from Shenyang today stating that as soon as the Soviet army withdraws from Changchun, at least one group will go to that area to try to prevent the battle for Changchun. The situation in that area is tense, with a sense that "the storm is brewing."</p>

<h3>China Has Immense Recuperative Power and Can Become a Strong Eastern Nation; U.S. Officials Hold Emergency Discussions on Economic Aid to China</h3>
<p>"United Press, Washington, 30th" According to a high-ranking official: U.S. economic assistance to China is absolutely necessary and must be completed. Research into methods for China's recovery, roughly related to finance, is currently undergoing lengthy emergency consultations here. When asked if lending to China was worth the risk, the official replied firmly: "The answer is quite simple. We really have no choice but to assist China." The official, who has a background and experience in China, and is now closely involved in Sino-U.S. affairs, stated that if China falls into prolonged economic chaos and political division, the U.S.'s war objectives in the Pacific would be half-lost. If China cannot become a strong, democratic nation, the Pacific will fall into indescribable chaos. Establishing a transportation system to revive China is absolutely necessary. China's problem is our problem and it is the greatest problem we face in the world today. China has immense recuperative power. One thing that is gratifying is that one can see cheerful, intelligent faces in China. Although the Chinese people have endured hardship, their spirit has not been broken. They are truly a superior people. China must have the strength to become a dominant power in the Pacific, replacing Japan. The United States has proven to the Chinese that its current extensive activities in China have no hidden motives. When asked if there were any signs that Japan's propaganda of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere had taken root in China, the official replied no, because the Japanese are hated everywhere and can be said to have achieved their goal. He also said that traveling in China today is extremely difficult, so restoring the operation of China's arteries is urgently needed. The first step is to restore navigation on the Yangtze River. At present, navigation is not smooth due to a lack of trained sailors to operate internal combustion engine powered riverboats.</p>

Second, Belgium formed a new cabinet today, with a strong left-wing flavor. Six of the new cabinet members are from the Liberal Party, five are from the Communist Party, and three are independents. Third, a new cabinet was formed in Bulgaria, with participation from all parties, including two members of the opposition who demanded new elections and opposed the Communist Party joining the government. Fourth, in Frankfurt, western Germany, remnants of the Nazi "Werewolf" organization carried out a large-scale party uprising, and dozens of people were arrested, including a former leader of the Hitler Youth.</p>
<p>[United Press, Athens, 30th] The Greek election is one of the most important elections in post-war Europe.

Experienced political observers here believe that the election results will favor the right-wing party, or be a preliminary step towards the restoration of King George.</p>

Well-informed Iranian and British circles believe that although there is no written agreement between the Soviet Union and Iran, the two governments may have some kind of "understanding," namely that if the Iranian central government does not send troops to garrison the area, allowing the local autonomous government to maintain its power, then the Soviet troops may even withdraw from Azerbaijan.</p>
<h3>Bevin Calls on the Powers to Abandon Imperialism; Do Not Use Military Force to Resolve Disputes Under Any Circumstances</h3>
<p>[United Press, Bristol, 30th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin, speaking to the Transport and General Workers' Union tonight, called on the world's powers to abandon the method of negotiating through threats, and proposed that the United Nations establish a proper mechanism to resolve economic competition, but did not mention the dispute between the Soviet Union and Iran. Bevin said that it is inappropriate for large countries to occupy the territory of small countries by force, forcing them to negotiate or thereby obtaining concessions. The use of force is the imperialism of the nineteenth century. Member states of the United Nations should conclude an agreement that, under no circumstances, should military force be used to resolve disputes. Imperialism must be abandoned, and the belief is that a solution can be found, and to accept a principle that representatives of major countries are unwilling to use military force. The method of negotiating through threats must be abandoned, and there is even more to this, such as if important raw material relationships cause conflicts between major countries, there should be a suitable mechanism to deal with them, instead of adopting the old method of resolving with military force.</p>

<h3>Tentative Proposals for Implementing a New Land Policy (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Tao Qiwu</p>
<p>Victory came too suddenly, and all restoration preparation work seemed rushed and unable to keep up with the pace of time. The situation after the victory, the political and military developments in various localities, were also beyond my prior predictions. Of course, in terms of seizing the time, we should, on the one hand, take over, and on the other hand, immediately issue emergency decrees based on the Kuomintang's land policy, adjust the distribution of land and people, and implement land revolution. However, in reality, the situation across the country varies greatly. To solve the current problems, we cannot ignore reality and must adapt to local conditions, formulating methods that can be smoothly implemented under a single policy (from "land to the tiller" to "land nationalization") for different regions with varying conditions. In the author's opinion, the implementation of land reform nationwide should be divided into three major regions, and the methods adopted in these three major regions do not necessarily have to be the same. The major divisions of these regions are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Reclaimed areas originally under enemy and puppet control;</p>
<p>(B) The Free Area of the Great Rear;</p>
<p>(C) Special areas (including areas where conflicts have ceased—using the name "Political Consultative Conference"—as well as what the Communist Party calls guerrilla areas, and former enemy-occupied regime areas).</p>
<p>(A) The first type of area mentioned above is reclaimed from enemy and puppet control. These areas are all along the river and coast, with convenient transportation, dense population, and fragmented land rights. The period of fall in these areas varies. Some are war zones with intertwined fronts, resulting in population displacement, loss of land records, and large areas becoming wasteland. In some areas, the fall lasted for a long time, and the enemy and puppets established a new order that lasted for several years, during which land rights were transferred repeatedly. The relationship between owners and land falls into the following four categories: (1) those with deeds and boundaries; (2) those with deeds but no boundaries; (3) those with no deeds but boundaries; and (4) those with no deeds and no boundaries.</p>
<p>When the local government is established in the recovered areas, the land administration authorities should, together with fair and upright local gentry (who did not collaborate with the enemy), immediately establish a Land Rights Evaluation Committee to re-evaluate all land ownership in the county. All owners should apply to the committee for registration and review within the prescribed public notice period. Upon receiving the application, the committee should handle it separately according to the following standards:</p>
<p>(1) For owners with deeds and boundaries, if it is verified that the deed was issued by a legitimate local authority before the fall, or has been registered, their ownership should be recognized. If their land has been forcibly occupied, the committee should immediately rule to return it to the original owner. If the deed is issued or approved by the puppet government, they should be required to provide local legitimate persons or shopkeepers to prove that their acquisition of ownership went through legal procedures and did not involve plunder, and it should also be recognized. (2), (3) For those with deeds but no boundaries and those with boundaries but no deeds, the original owners should be required to provide boundary and deed certificates or ancestral guarantees. After examination and public announcement procedures, if there is no doubt, their ownership can also be confirmed. If it has been illegally occupied, it should also be ordered to be returned.</p>
<p>After the above land is returned to the original owner, or the original owner's ownership is confirmed, the exercise of their ownership should be subject to the following restrictions: (1) No arbitrary increase in tenant rent is allowed. (2) No arbitrary eviction of tenants is allowed. (3) The acreage of fields is not allowed to exceed a certain limit, and the excess part will be confiscated by the Land Rights Evaluation Committee. (4) For land returned or confirmed to the original owner according to the above standards, if it is excessively fragmented or scattered, making it inconvenient for cultivation, the evaluation committee should order the owners to consult and concentrate it into a single piece through exchange and division methods to facilitate cultivation. However, if the land has different fertility, the party benefiting more from the exchange and division should compensate the party suffering losses based on the current value. (5) If tenants or hired farmers owe debts to the landlord during the fall period, the evaluation committee should rule to reasonably reduce or exempt them.</p>
<p>(4) As for the fourth type of land with no boundaries and no deeds, as well as land that does not meet the provisions of items (1), (2), and (3) to determine the owner's ownership, confiscated excess land, abandoned land in war zones, and land confiscated from the enemy and puppets, should all be taken over by the evaluation committee. Taking the township as a unit, it should be distributed to the following personnel for cultivation according to the method of allotting land based on population. The priority order is as follows: 1. Returning refugees from the township. 2. Retired soldiers. 3. Public and educational personnel registered in the township. (Even if public and educational personnel are working elsewhere, their families should have the right to allocation, so that farming and education can be integrated, and the lives of public and educational personnel are not easy to improve for a while. Allocating land for their families to cultivate can support integrity and help reduce corruption in governance). Allotting land based on population should be mainly self-cultivation, and it should be stipulated that they have lifelong use rights, so as to truly achieve "land to the tiller."</p>
<p>(B) The Free Area of the Great Rear. During the eight years of bitter war, the Great Rear provided adequate military and civilian food supplies, which cannot but be attributed to the hard work of most farmers. During the war of resistance, food prices followed commodity prices, rising step by step, allowing landlords to gain profits without labor, increasing their income. In reality, the surplus grain of the tenants and hired farmers who actually cultivate the land is often not enough for one year's consumption. Whenever there is a shortage of grain, they resort to high-interest loans to survive, and when the new grain is harvested, they use it to pay off debts at low prices, so their lives are never easy to improve. On the landlord side, since the war of resistance, although they have made every effort to contribute through requisitions and purchases, they have also made great contributions to the country. However, due to the circumstances, they have reaped huge profits, making wealth more concentrated, and the distribution of social wealth is even more uneven, which the government cannot ignore. The method of adjustment should follow the legislative principles of the Land Law, and implement the following measures effectively with moderate means:</p>
<p>(1) Increase the land value tax, so that land prices fall, giving individual farmers the opportunity to buy land.</p>
<p>(2) Implement a 25% rent reduction, so that the landlord's income does not exceed 37.5% of the total income from the cultivated land's main produce. If this can be strictly implemented, land prices are expected to fall, giving tenants the opportunity to purchase land.</p>
<p>(3) Implement a land limit system, so that the number of fields owned by each household does not exceed a certain limit. Collect high progressive taxes on the excess to prevent excessive concentration of land. If the landlord sells the field, the tenant has the right to purchase it at a preferential price.</p>
<p>(4) Protect the tenancy rights and perpetual tenancy rights of tenants, so that landlords cannot evict tenants at will. Only when tenants have definite guarantees can they do their best to improve their land.</p>
<p>(5) In most parts of the Great Rear, except for central and southeastern Sichuan, cultivation has been carried out everywhere, and the land can be said to have been utilized to a considerable extent. However, in provinces such as Guizhou, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Xinjiang, and Qinghai, there are barren mountains and wastelands everywhere. The government should allocate retired officers and soldiers, public and educational personnel and their families to settle and cultivate, or recruit reclamation personnel to invest in agriculture. After reclamation is completed, the reclamation personnel should be given considerable benefits, and then gradually repay their investment.</p>
<p>(6) Confiscate the land of absentee landlords and allocate it to retired officers and soldiers, public and educational personnel, or their families to cultivate. The above reclaimed areas and free areas of the Great Rear all recognize private land ownership to a considerable extent, but with moderate restrictions. If implemented in this way, the income of landlords who gain without cultivation will gradually decrease, and they will have to gradually sell their land to invest in industry and commerce? Large landlords will be automatically eliminated, and at the same time, those with the ability to cultivate can have the opportunity to acquire land, without the need to achieve the goal through violence. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teaching of "land to the tiller" can be fully achieved.</p>
<p>(C) Special areas. Part of the land in the special zone has already been reallocated, and part is in newly expanded areas after Japan's surrender, and the distribution relationship seems to be in transition. Whether to recognize its current system or to readjust it with regard to land disposal in this area depends on the outcome of the "consultation" before a decision can be made. However, what is adopted in this area seems to be purely a system of land nationalization. All land of bureaucrats, warlords, local bullies, landlords, ancestral halls, temples, association properties, and rich peasants has been confiscated and reallocated to hired farmers, poor peasants, middle peasants, workers, soldiers, or their families. The theory of land public ownership was originally recognized by Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and general scholars, but the means adopted by each other are different. In fact, the boundaries of the fields in these areas have been completely destroyed, and the original landlords may no longer exist. Most of the land has adopted collective management methods, and restoring the original state is impossible and unnecessary. It is best to think of ways from a positive perspective. In this type of area, we should actively develop farmland water conservancy, promote scientific management, such as improving soil to prevent disasters, and expanding the use of land machinery, so that cultivation efficiency reaches the highest level, so that the least amount of manpower can harvest the greatest output. As a result, everyone can recognize that the efficiency and harvest of public, state-owned, and collectively operated businesses are indeed better than self-cultivation on a small area of individual land. If this trend is created and farmers gain universal belief, then without forcible supervision, everyone will automatically move in this direction.</p>
<p>The above three types of regions adopt different methods, but they all lead to the same goal (land to the tiller—land nationalization), and the ultimate goal is still the same.</p>
<p>Land is necessary for human life. Our food, clothing, housing, and transportation all come directly or indirectly from the land. If the land problem is solved properly, the source of food and clothing for the people will be inexhaustible, and then we can talk about industrial construction, promote social progress, and economic prosperity. If the solution is improper and the land cannot be used effectively and distributed reasonably, the result of monopolizing land benefits and wasting local resources will inevitably lead to social injustice and hinder the progress of economic life. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said: "The primary task of nation-building is people's livelihood." The implementation of the Principle of People's Livelihood must take equal land rights as a prerequisite. If the land is used to its fullest potential, the vast rural areas can be stabilized, agricultural production can be increased, and industrial raw materials will not be lacking. If the living standards of farmers are improved and their purchasing power is increased, there will be a broad market for industrial products to digest. And the stability and prosperity of rural order and security are undoubtedly a prerequisite for the widespread development of industrial construction. Therefore, equal land rights and industrial construction must advance simultaneously and complement each other. The great cause of nation-building can then be successful. If we are biased towards one side, the result will inevitably be nothing. Now that the war has been won and domestic political consultation has succeeded, we hope that the government will seize the opportunity, while planning the entire industrial construction, make a bold decision in a timely manner based on the Principle of People's Livelihood land policy and the successive resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session and the Second Plenary Session, and solve the land problem.

<h3>Great Difficulties in Import and Export Trade, Many Reasons, Difficult to Make Profits, Most Merchants Maintain a Wait-and-See Attitude, Foreign Goods Arrive Slowly, Unbearable Interest Burden, Most Raw Silk Exports Suffer Losses, Ninety Percent of Pig Bristles Are Returned</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper news] This reporter recently visited a giant in the import and export industry in this city, asking about the general situation of the import and export industry in this city. I was told: It has not been long since our country opened up foreign exchange; the import and export industry has just resumed, and there is a sense of unfamiliarity and difficulty in all aspects. Difficulties on the import side include: (1) The designated banks fail to provide as much foreign exchange as needed by importers and exporters. (2) The schedules of ships sailing from foreign countries to China are often uncertain. (3) Industrial and other necessities are also in short supply in foreign countries, so an order often takes four or five months, and there is no definite news of arrival in Shanghai. For this reason, importers in this city have a wait-and-see attitude towards import trade. It is understood that the implicit interest rate in the wood market is very high. When ordering goods from abroad, the full amount of the goods must be paid. Now, if the goods cannot arrive in port for four or five months, whether it is still profitable to bear the huge interest burden even if the goods arrive in the future is quite doubtful. There are also difficulties on the export side: (1) The quality of local products has gradually declined after the war, and it does not meet the standards required by foreign countries. (2) The transportation situation in various places has not yet recovered, and it is quite difficult to transport local products to Shanghai. It is said that among the recent exports, raw silk and pig bristles account for the majority. The former often suffers losses after export. The latter is mostly returned because the quality does not meet the standards. Therefore, it is hoped that in the future, export products should be inspected and qualified by our Commodity Inspection Bureau before being exported. At the same time, it is also hoped that we can negotiate with American merchants to use the inspection results of our Commodity Inspection Bureau as the standard for export products, so as to avoid disputes over inspection standards.</p>
<p>Import and Export Companies Establish Guild</p>
<p>[Our newspaper news] The Shanghai Import and Export Companies Guild, after two months of preparation, held its inaugural meeting at 2:00 p.m. yesterday on the sixth floor of the Pudong Native Place Association.

The plane was personally piloted by Captain Yu of a certain squadron of our Air Force and is expected to arrive in Tokyo in eight hours.</p>
<h3>Tax Bureau to Hold Registration of Customs Brokers</h3>
<p>Merchants in this city mostly entrust customs brokers to handle procedures with the Goods Tax Bureau to declare and transport unified tax goods and apply for the necessary documents and permits. However, some customs brokers have not handled matters satisfactorily, and even delay forwarding the documents and permits they have obtained. When the consignors urge for transportation, they arbitrarily shirk their responsibilities. It is learned that the Tax Bureau, in view of this, has ordered strict prevention and will hold registration of customs brokers to rectify the situation.</p>
<h3>Add Trains to Wuxi for Easy Tomb Sweeping</h3>
<p>In view of the approaching Qingming Festival, the Two-Roads Administration has added a third-class passenger train from Shanghai to Wuxi at 9:20 a.m. every day starting yesterday to facilitate passengers returning home to sweep tombs. The train stops at Nanxiang, Huangdu, Anting, Kunshan, Weiting, Suzhou, Wangting, and can arrive in Wuxi at 12:28 p.m. on the same day.</p>
<p>In addition, the bureau has recently reported that unscrupulous people often purchase passenger tickets from the bureau and resell them at higher prices outside. This is abhorrent. In addition to strict investigation and prohibition, the bureau hereby announces to passengers that they must purchase tickets at the ticket window in accordance with the bureau's regulations to avoid losses.</p>

Yesterday, they were escorted to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.</p>
<h3>A Major Theft Case Cracked, Twelve Boxes of Bayer Pharmaceuticals, Worth 50 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper news] The Ministry of Military Administration's Military Administration Department received the First Army Hospital of the Japanese Army in Jiangwan last year, which stored a large number of valuable Western medicines produced by the German Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory. Unexpectedly, they were repeatedly stolen, resulting in huge losses. Later, the department sent personnel to guard it day and night, but thefts still occurred. He Chenggeng, a military medical supervisor, and Wang Shulin, an adjutant of the Shanghai Health General Warehouse of the Ministry of Military Administration, found out that they had colluded with police officers from the Changshu Police Bureau to go to the residence of Wang Kechang, an employee at No. 27 Dumei New Village, Pushi Road, and seized twelve boxes of Bayer pharmaceuticals on the spot, worth more than 50 million yuan. At that time, Wang was out and had not returned. The police bureau and others continued to arrest two accomplices elsewhere and took them to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Shi Konghuai Discusses the Problem of Building a Bridge over the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper news] Mao Yisheng, a Chinese bridge expert, expressed his views on the bridge over the Huangpu River that is being planned for construction in this city, saying that if a high bridge is built on the Bund of Zhongzheng Road, the bridgehead must start in front of the Great World..., If a tunnel is built, the Shanghai beach is too deep, and the stone is only encountered more than 900 feet below the water surface, which is the same difficulty as building a high bridge. Mao's conclusion is that only a movable flat bridge can be built temporarily, and the middle part of the bridge can be opened at a specified time for ships to pass through. It is said that direct transportation between the two sides of the Huangpu River is extremely important for the development of Shanghai's commercial port and the development of the Pudong area, and all parties are paying close attention to this issue. Yesterday, this reporter met with Shi Konghuai, a Chinese port expert. According to Shi, "There were originally many ferries on both sides of the Huangpu River south of the Bund of Zhongzheng Road, but it is still felt that they cannot pass at any time, and there are some obstacles to navigation. Now Shanghai is not only the largest commercial port in our country, but also one of the world's major ports. Its future development is unlimited. Anything that hinders navigation should be avoided as much as possible, so building a flat bridge on the Bund of Zhongzheng Road should be carefully considered. As for the tunnel, it does not have to be built on the stone. For example, the New York Holland Tunnel, which passes through the Hudson River, is built in the mud and sand at the bottom of the river. The deepest point of the tunnel averages about 101.5 feet from the high water surface to the bottom of the tunnel, so there is no need to be as deep as more than 900 feet below the water surface. Although the construction cost of the tunnel is more expensive than that of the high bridge, its convenience for land and water transportation is far superior to that of the high bridge, especially in national defense, it has a more secure value. I hope it will be available for the authorities to study."</p>
<h3>Shout on Tangshan Road, Apprentice Killed by Bullet</h3>

<h3>Drive Robbery Gold</h3>

The shop assistant Fei (21 years old, from Changzhou) took a gold bar from Hongfa Silver Shop on Luoyang Road and Chengdu Road, weighing 9 liang and 8 qian. The customer thought it was satisfactory and asked Fei to go to his home to get the money. Unexpectedly, when he was walking in the Song Village Lane at 312 on the same road, the customer suddenly took out a pistol to threaten him and fled with the gold. The victim reported to the Taishan Branch for investigation. The fugitive was wearing a green robe and suit pants, and was about twenty years old.</p>
<h3>More Than 400 Traitors Urged by the Court to Send Them</h3>
<p>It is rumored that more than 400 important and secondary traitors who have been arrested one after another have been transferred to the court and will be publicly tried. According to the person in charge of the Prosecutor's Office of the High Court, these traitors have not been sent to this court by political and military agencies, but they have been repeatedly contacted to urge their delivery in order to expedite the trial. Regarding the confiscation of traitors' property, leaving living expenses for their families is also based on the principle of the number of family members and the needs of the environment, and there is no fixed amount or explicit provision. It is also said that the Prosecutor's Office of the Court is currently promoting judicial duties in extreme difficulties due to the large number of cases, the small number of people, the low salaries, and the lack of housing and supplies.</p>
<h3>Health Authorities: Not Afraid of More Garbage, Good Use of Waste</h3>
<p>— Reported by our correspondent, Canglong</p>
<p>Do you hate garbage? But Shanghai has a lot of it! If you don't believe it, Mayor Qian's report at the Municipal Council the other day will astound you. He said that when the municipal government first took over, there were more than 10,000 tons of garbage in the streets of the city. Under the supervision of the relevant authorities, a total of 382,661 tons of garbage have been cleared in the past six months!</p>
<p>Where does so much garbage come from, and who collects it? And how is it disposed of? Urban children living in their ivory towers may not pay attention to these "trivial matters." But the Health Bureau has established a Cleaning Brigade specifically for clearing garbage. The brigade is divided into eight squadrons, each responsible for the work of one police district.</p>
<p>According to statistics, the city's daily garbage production is between 1,600 and 3,000 tons. During Christmas and New Year's holidays, the amount of garbage produced is even more frightening. What to do? Only urge street sweepers and garbage collectors to work harder. There are now more than 3,000 street sweepers working every day, which is one-third more than before the victory. These urban garbage removers have to go to each workstation at 6:30 every morning to report (meaning roll call). By 7:30, they have all arrived at their work destinations and started their cleaning tasks. From 11:30 to 1:30, it is their lunch time. After that, they have to work until 4:30 or 5:00 before stopping. Every day, each street sweeper is responsible for sweeping garbage within one kilometer, and each garbage collector is responsible for collecting, transporting, and disposing of thirty large and small garbage cans.</p>
<p>However, many people still dump garbage on the streets. The Health Bureau has decided that before May 1 this year, every household in the city must prepare a container for garbage. Every day at a certain time, a garbage truck specially dispatched by the Health Bureau will come to collect it, ringing a bell.</p>
<p>Currently, there are three ways to dispose of garbage: land reclamation, landfill, and incineration. Most of the garbage is transported by garbage boats to vacant land near Sanlintang in Pudong for temporary storage. The Health Bureau believes that these disposal methods are outdated, so they have planned a thorough and fundamental cleaning method. They plan to divide the city's garbage into five categories: (1) animal waste such as meat bones and fish bones, (2) plant waste such as vegetable roots and bark, (3) cloth strips and paper scraps, (4) tin cans and waste cans, and (5) cinder and ash. After this analysis, most of the garbage can be turned into useful things. How to transform it?</p>
<p>There is quite a lot of second-category garbage. The plant waste collected from the city's twenty-seven vegetable markets every day is already considerable. The Health Bureau plans to concentrate this type of garbage in a disused public cemetery, let it corrode, and according to chemical principles, it can produce a large amount of CH4, which is combustible biogas. In this way, the combustion of biogas can be used to incinerate unnecessary garbage, and the combustion of biogas will also be used to generate steam. The third category of garbage, cloth strips and paper scraps, can be melted into pulp to make recycled paper. This is an exciting plan to produce materials from garbage, which you may not believe. However, the Health Bureau is actively promoting it and hopes to realize it within this year.</p>
<p>The preliminary plan is said to utilize the city's Baojia system for mutual assistance and cooperation. The Health Bureau will, on the one hand, try to place five types of garbage containers everywhere, supervise and urge specialists to classify the garbage first, and then provide different treatments.</p>
<p>Undeniably, Nanshi is still the place with the most accumulated garbage. The Health Bureau said that it is now determined to deal with it comprehensively, starting with the Yemiao district in Nanshi as the starting point for garbage removal. The elders and leaders of the district have now been convened to discuss ways to remove the garbage.</p>
<p>In such a large city, there are many restaurants, but there are only 217 public toilets in the city, which is far from the actual needs. It is now said that another 200 will be added, of which 88 are expected to be completed within the year, and ten urinals will also be added recently.</p>
<p>Do you hate garbage? Not entirely! Don't bury the garbage! There is nothing useless in the world; it depends on how people use it. However, if you are determined to produce a lot of garbage, remember to put it in your own garbage can. Even if you don't use it, it will still be used by the public. Useless garbage can be turned into useful materials again.</p>

<h3>Social Services</h3>
<p>Cao Tingzhang of Aurora University asks the editor: I have the following questions, please answer them: (1) I am a nephew. My aunt (my uncle has passed away) mortgaged the property to someone in the 20th year of the Republic of China, a shop, for 700 legal tender, using a receipt as a mortgage and rent as interest. When the term expired, it was during the War of Resistance, and it was not redeemed. If it is redeemed now, will it still be calculated in legal tender? According to the public announcement of the Central Economic Special Commissioner in October last year, pre-war deposits are all calculated in legal tender. Is the same procedure applicable to pre-war debts? If calculated according to the price index, how many times should it be increased? (2) My aunt borrowed 300 legal tender from someone in the 17th year of the Republic of China, using a house receipt as a mortgage. Later, interest was added to the principal, and another 100 yuan was borrowed, bringing the total to 600 yuan in the 26th year. Is it still calculated in legal tender now? (3) Can I handle the above questions on my behalf, or does my aunt still have to handle them on her own?</p>
<p>Lawyer Duanmu Kai answers: (1) Pre-war debts are handled in the same way as deposits. (Refer to Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Proceedings after Reconstruction) (2) Repayment now is still calculated in legal tender. (3) The original debtor should handle the matter.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyao asks: My wife is in her twenties. In June last year, she was seven months pregnant.

After a few minutes, the cramps in her hands and feet stopped, her eyes returned to normal, but her throat made a gurgling sound and there was foam. At first, it happened once every ten days, but now it happens every two or three days after giving birth, sometimes several times a day. Her body is very afraid of cold and has little strength. When it happens, it starts from the teeth, then goes up to the brain, over the shoulders and to the hands and feet, and then she becomes confused. Western doctors say that she needs to be injected with glucose calcium, but dozens of injections have been ineffective. Please indicate what the disease is and what special pills or injections are effective. I am very grateful.</p>

<h3>Last Week's Gold and Foreign Exchange Market Weak, Securities Speculation Unusually Prosperous, Grain Market Prices Gradually Decline</h3>
<p>The trends of various industries last week were relatively stable, but some hot money has not developed normally and is still active in speculative black market transactions. Initially, the rice market was tight due to rain, and merchants raised prices, with white japonica rice hovering around 32,000 yuan. Later, the weather cleared and arrivals increased sharply, causing a general decline. By the weekend, white japonica rice had fallen to 28,000 yuan. Cotton yarn prices rose due to strong demand from Guangdong merchants. The cloth market was soft, but poplin and printed cloth prices were firm due to seasonality. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Gold Bullion: Due to the end of the month, those in urgent need of funds frequently sold, and the Bank of China's exchange rate remained unchanged, continuing the weakness. At the beginning of the week, it was around 1.6 million, and then it gradually fell. By Saturday afternoon, it had fallen below the 1.5 million mark to 1,495,000, and finally closed at 1.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Unified Bonds: Rumors were rife, and hot money was rampant. Although the authorities were investigating and banning it, the black market was still rampant. The market price of unified bonds rose steadily. On Tuesday, a certain large short-seller dumped a large amount, causing a slight rebound. On Wednesday, buying interest at low prices was strong again, and it seemed to rise again. Type C bonds exceeded the 3,000 yuan mark. On Thursday, some short positions could not be delivered and were suspended, but scattered transactions were still pushing up the price. By Saturday, Type C bonds had risen sharply to 3,400, and the rest had rebounded slightly.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange: The US exchange rate was 2,020 yuan, and there was no progress in US dollars, so it remained within 2,000 yuan. Hong Kong dollars gradually sold off after speculators made profits, falling once. Old goods fell from 435 yuan to 415 yuan, and new goods once approached the 200 yuan mark. On Saturday, it was slightly firmer, but still 20-30 yuan lower than the previous week.</p>
<p>Stocks: At the beginning of the week, Chinese stocks were slightly hesitant, and foreign stocks saw a surge in sellers, but the steel industry was particularly strong. On Wednesday, buying interest in Chinese stocks was strong, and the market price rose steadily, creating an unprecedented peak. Foreign stocks were also lifted by the rise in Chinese stocks. The next day, there was a dispute in the bond market, and it was also the eve of the holiday, so the industry generally took a wait-and-see attitude. Chinese stocks initially stabilized, but then fell back in the middle, but the three small stocks rose particularly high. Foreign stocks had different supply and demand, and rose and fell differently. At the weekend, some people were searching for large Chinese stocks, and the price rose again. Small stocks such as Xinguang fell slightly, and there were no other changes. Sentiment in foreign stocks was boosted, and they rose unanimously, with paper stocks rising even more.</p>
<p>Spun Yarn: In the past week, the initial trend was very mediocre. Later, the actual needs of the Guangdong merchants continued, especially on Saturday when purchases were the most smooth. And there was news of immediate shipment, so new buying and short covering were very enthusiastic, while new sellers were relatively scarce, forming a situation where demand exceeded supply. The highest transaction for the entire week was 2.85 million for 60-count Sunlight fine yarn on Saturday, an increase of 200,000 from the previous week. 20-count special Double Horse yarn rose by 90,000, followed by 10-count Boy Scout yarn, which rose by 110,000. The other yarns rose by 30-50,000.</p>
<p>Cloth Market: Due to the abundance of inventory on the market, there was little demand from merchants and stores, and textile mills could not start selling, so the market was lifeless. Among the various brands, Daming poplin rose the most, 4,000 yuan more than the previous week. Coarse cloth was stable, and fine yarn and Shilin cloth fell by 3-4,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton Market: The source of foreign cotton was continuous, and manufacturers and cotton firms were increasingly waiting and watching. Purchases were not as strong as in the previous weeks, but at the weekend, the price of US cotton futures soared by more than 60 pounds, and the price of cotton in Shanghai also had a booming trend. As a result, the prices of various cottons rose by 3-5,000 compared to the previous week.</p>
<h3>West Sichuan Hongtong Oil on the Market</h3>
<p>After eight years of the War of Resistance, West Sichuan Hongtong oil, which had disappeared from the market, has gradually resumed production this spring and has been successively transported to Shanghai. The sales of various brands, such as Xu Yongchang, Liu Tongqing, Liu Qingyuanfeng, Dachangfeng, Xiao Hengqing, etc., have all arrived in one or two batches, so the wholesale of each store has returned to the pre-war state. The selling price is between 84-85,000 yuan per barrel, while Hongjiang Tung oil, which is self-made in the Mudi and Suxi areas, has been naturally eliminated. Although the selling price is cheaper, at 60,000 yuan per barrel, it is difficult to compete in comparison. It is heard that Zhengpai Hongtong oil, such as Jichanghe and Jiyingfeng, are also preparing to resume production, and it is expected that they can be listed on the market in the spring this winter.</p>
<h3>Redemption of Counterfeit Currency, Ended as Scheduled Yesterday, Very Little Remained</h3>
<p>The redemption of counterfeit Central Reserve Bank notes ended yesterday, and from today on, they will become waste paper. The four banks and two bureaus and some banks and Zhuang's counterfeit currency redemption departments all followed orders and continued to work on the holiday yesterday, until 5:00 pm. However, the number of people redeeming counterfeit currency yesterday was not as crowded as expected. According to Bank of China officials, the counterfeit currency redemption period lasted for five months from November 1 of last year to yesterday. Compared with the currently redeemed amount, there is little difference from the nominal issue amount of 41,993 billion yuan for counterfeit currency. The amount left over is obviously very small. As for the redemption work in various outer ports, Bank of China had previously telegraphed to report by telegram or letter yesterday. Bank of China will not accept overdue redemptions. However, the area where counterfeit currency is circulating is as wide as ten sparrows, and telegrams and letters take time, so the total number of redemptions will have to wait until three days later to be known.</p>
<h3>World Tea Famine, Americans Dissatisfied with Inferior Tea</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, March 31] At present, people in various countries around the world, especially in the United States, are quite dissatisfied with the abundance of inferior tea on the market. Although the needs of various countries have increased, the United Nations Food Agency has not greatly increased the allocation for the coming year. For countries that are not major food producers, the ration is only half of what they consumed before the war, but the supply to Britain and the United States has not decreased significantly. Unless Dutch East Indies and other liberated areas of the East can export 200 million pounds per year, it seems unlikely that tea rations and controls will be lifted. But to reach this figure, it will take at least two years after the situation in the Dutch East Indies has stabilized. It is estimated that one-third of the tea-producing areas in the Dutch East Indies have been destroyed or abandoned and are not suitable for planting.</p>
<h3>Method of Endorsing Negotiable Instruments, Abolished from Today</h3>
<p>The old habits of receiving and paying negotiable instruments in the city's banking industry will be changed from today, and the principle of holding the bill (i.e., the person who holds the money) will be implemented. In order to comply with the principles of the Ministry of Orders and the four joint offices, the Shanghai Silver and Money Industry Association has stipulated that all existing checks that contain the name or title of the payee are registered, and those that do not contain the name or title of the payee are unregistered. Regardless of whether the words "bearer" or "holder" are crossed out, the holder of the bill is the person who holds the money. The practice of guaranteeing endorsements by collection agencies in the past is abolished at the same time.</p>
<h3>Under Attack from Both Internal and External Forces, the Production Industry Seeks Self-Salvation, City Chamber of Commerce Holds Meeting Today</h3>
<p>(Reported by this newspaper) The City Chamber of Commerce will convene various industrial associations at Yushi this afternoon to discuss ways to cope with the current crisis in the industrial sector. Recently, foreign orders have increased, and the production of domestic products has fallen behind, while general import firms are still calling for and accepting orders. Labor unrest is also increasing day by day. With the sharp rise in the cost of living, factories cannot calculate production costs, and work stoppages are heard of every day. Investment in new factories is even regarded as a dangerous path. At the request of several important industrial associations, the City Chamber of Commerce is convening a meeting today to agree on ways to cope with the situation.</p>
<h3>Inventory Verification at the Enemy and Puppet Yarn and Cloth Clearing Office</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] With the collaboration of the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau and the China Textile Construction Corporation, the "Enemy and Puppet Yarn and Cloth Clearing Office" was established. The office is located at 452 Jiangxi Road in this city. Its mission is to investigate the actual inventory of yarn and cloth in various warehouses, based on the receiving records, dividing into groups, taking samples, and determining prices for the Textile Construction Corporation to sell. It has been operating for almost a month. Among the staff, there are experienced personnel from the former puppet merchants' association. It is reported that a large portion of the goods that the Textile Construction Corporation is selling comes from this office. According to the results of the inventory check against the records, some of the goods are no longer very usable due to being stored for too long.</p>
<h3>Customs and Electric Factory to Auction Large Quantities of Materials</h3>
<p>The Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau entrusted the Jianghai Customs to start auctioning a large quantity of enemy and puppet materials starting today.

<h3>Economic Briefs</h3>
<p>[Reuters News Agency, New York, 31st Dispatch] New York Governor Dewey recently approved a bill allowing New York State banks to close every Saturday from June to September for four months.</p>
<p>The Chongqing branch of the Central Bank started operations today at the original site of the business office at Daomenkou, Chongqing. The manager is Yang Xiaobo, and there are 190 staff members. Before the government returns to the capital, the branch will handle the external business of the business office and all over-the-counter business of the National Treasury Bureau in Chongqing. The Foreign Exchange Department will be temporarily suspended until the head office decides on the application methods for foreign exchange in various locations, and then personnel will be sent to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Regarding the government's efforts to restore the aquatic products industry, it is learned that it plans to allocate 2 billion yuan to organize the China Aquatic Products Company, with its address in Shanghai, to engage in the processing of various marine products.</p>
<p>With the capital's return imminent, the Liquid Fuel Management Committee of the Executive Yuan established the Chongqing Office in Chongqing on the 26th to strengthen its work in the Chongqing area, and appointed Huang Shiji as the director.</p>
<p>It is learned that by the end of last year, the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau had received chemical industrial raw materials, pharmaceuticals, etc., worth approximately 20 billion yuan from the German companies Defu and Bayer in Shanghai. The quantity and value of the materials received have since doubled. The Enemy Property Bureau has already sold pigments worth 36 million yuan and pharmaceuticals worth 250 million yuan.</p>
<p>Timber production has always been scarce in the Jiangnan area. With the recovery period now, there is a great need for timber, so prices have risen sharply and it is difficult to purchase. This phenomenon is particularly serious in the Nanjing area. It is recently heard that merchants from Shayi have gathered a large amount of timber in Yichang, waiting for the river water to rise slightly before rafting it downstream to supply the market.</p>

In the second half, Donghua adjusted its lineup, with Zhuang Youren as a defender and Lin Genfu as a forward. This adjustment proved to be successful. In the 4th minute, Dai Linjing's shot hit the goalpost and bounced out. Li Yao happened to arrive in time and scored, giving Donghua a 1-0 lead. After that, their momentum increased. In the 15th minute, Sun Jinshun received a long pass from the backfield and sent it to Li Yao, who gently lobbed the ball over Wen Nuogan's head and into the net. Donghua won by two goals.

<h3>Production and Construction Should Emphasize: Increasing Production of Export Goods</h3>
<p>— Wang Naiyi</p>
<p>The author of this article, Mr. Wang Naiyi, has profound research in economic accounting and abundant writings. Currently, in addition to serving as an accounting consultant for various sectors, he also serves as the chief accountant of the Revitalize Tea Industry Company. The following article is indeed aimed at reality. —Editor</p>
<p>Our country has always been known as an import-surplus nation in international trade. After the War of Resistance, all commercial ports nationwide fell into enemy hands, and all foreign exchanges, except for military necessities, almost entirely ceased exporting commodities. Therefore, during the War of Resistance, all foreign trade was on the verge of stagnation. Since the victory, various parties have been shouting the slogan of restoring foreign trade. However, one should know that although an import surplus state is inevitable for an industrially immature country, striving to reduce the import surplus figures is not only something that the government authorities should pay attention to but also something that the nation's 450 million people should try to rectify. Now that the War of Resistance has just settled down, and everything is waiting to be rebuilt, we need foreign materials and various manufacturing machinery to help us; our expectations are sincere. At this time, talking about reducing the import surplus is not easy! The only method is to strengthen production and massively increase the export of tangible goods in order to remedy the import surplus of tangible goods. As for other measures to balance international payments, there are several intangible ones, which will be introduced in another article. At this moment, the author intends to briefly describe the current situation of tangible export trade:</p>
<p>Looking back to the period from the teens to the twenties of the Republic of China, trade figures were very calm, generally around one billion yuan or so. Up until the twenty-first year, due to the impact of the global recession and the occupation of the Northeast, the trade figures showed a significant decrease, some even dropping by half. Therefore, after the twenty-third and twenty-fourth years, the export trade volume was only a small amount of four to five hundred million yuan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to our country's export goods, raw materials have always accounted for the majority, which is enough to show the natural characteristics of an agricultural country's foreign trade. Since the Northeast was invaded, our country lost a large agricultural area that accounted for one-third of our export trade. Therefore, after the twenty-second year, raw materials fell to second place, while manufactured goods jumped to first place among export commodities; food and beverages further fell to third place. Among them, the rise of manufactured goods cannot be celebrated by the country, because their quantity has not increased, and it is caused by the most important factor: the bankruptcy of rural areas and the decline of agricultural affairs. The author hereby specifically points this out to avoid being mistaken for industrial progress and mistakenly believing that our country has risen to become an industrially advanced country? Wouldn't that be absurd?</p>
<p>The manufactured goods mentioned above include cotton cloth, cotton yarn, raw silk, and silk fabrics; raw materials include cotton, wool, cocoons, solid and liquid fuels, raw cowhide, ore, seeds, and oil; food and beverages include rice, miscellaneous grains, bean noodles, sugar, vegetables, fruits, preserved fruits, candies, livestock, meat, egg products, fish products, salt, tea, wine, and tobacco. Among them, the details of oil, tea, cotton yarn, and raw silk are the largest. According to agricultural and industrial production categories, agricultural products still account for an absolute majority.</p>
<p>If our country wants to increase the export volume, it must promote the production of various commodities listed above on a large scale, especially agricultural products. At this moment, seeking to promote the production of manufactured goods to compete with advanced countries seems too premature. With our country's immature industry, coupled with years of war, it is like a weak body that has just recovered from a serious illness. How can we compete with countries with flourishing industries, advanced science, and all-powerful machines? Therefore, the most appropriate and candid criticism at the moment is that the production of industrial manufacturing can be self-sufficient and not be dumped by foreign goods, which is considered the best of the best. As for developing the export of manufactured goods, it still needs to go through a considerable amount of time; and agricultural production has always been our country's export characteristic, so we must not allow it to remain in a state of decline permanently. Therefore, increasing tangible export goods should be agricultural products as the primary goal.</p>
<p>Recently, I heard from a friend who returned from the United States that the level of mechanical industrial development in various countries makes it difficult for our country to catch up even after decades of effort. Even the military or commercial machinery, ships, and warships that various countries have transferred to our country are mostly obsolete and unusable waste products from those countries, which our country still regards as precious treasures, which is disheartening.</p>
<p>Although the level of various undertakings in our country is so low, it is not without remedy! On the one hand, we should start by cultivating talents, adding machinery, and improving and enhancing various production methods. On the other hand, we should promote our country's inherent natural resources and strive to increase production in order to restore our international trade position. Therefore, the author believes that when discussing production and construction issues, we should awaken everyone to pay great attention to agricultural production so that export trade will not abandon the fundamental and pursue the superficial, falling into a dangerous path. President Chiang mentioned in his broadcast speech on the Tenth National Day that the economic construction policy should emphasize both agriculture and industry; and pointed out that industrial progress must be based on the development of agriculture. On February 25th, the author stated in this newspaper the general situation of tea farmers' production in the important sector of agriculture, and the importance of its relationship with national economy and people's livelihood can be generally seen; other agricultural products can also be inferred by analogy. The author's suggestions in this article also seek to emphasize both agriculture and industry, but believes that to revitalize foreign trade, agricultural production should be increased first. As for industrial production, it is advisable to first focus on domestic operations, taking resisting foreign imports as the primary task; then gradually expand to Southeast Asia, and expand to Europe and the United States, so that it can be said to be the most practical method of taking both internal and external factors into consideration, and simultaneously developing agriculture and industry.</p>
<p>Finally, in addition to hoping that the government and financial institutions will earnestly assist in implementing low-interest loans, reducing product costs, strengthening transportation capacity, purchasing new machinery, and cultivating technical management talents, they should also promulgate measures to encourage increased production of export commodities and measures to encourage export trade, appropriately exempting part of the tariffs and transportation costs of export products, and actively undertaking export usance, in order to promote the smooth turnover of funds for export merchants; and facilitate export customs clearance procedures as much as possible; at the same time, it is hoped that the industry will pay special attention to agricultural products that occupy an important position in exports, invest heavily, and try their best to remedy various difficulties, to achieve the ultimate goal of the expected increase in agricultural production. The completion of the large-scale export of important export commodities, the revival of international markets, the reduction of import deficit figures, and the acquisition of foreign exchange chips are all deeply reliant on this.</p>
<h3>Production Construction and Enjoying One's Work</h3>
<p>— Yao Siwei</p>
<p>In today's society, everything is advancing by leaps and bounds, which is very different from the past. Therefore, it will be even more difficult for future generations to establish themselves in society and achieve success. Because the faster the progress, the fiercer the competition. In this ever-progressing society, we have to struggle to find an opportunity to establish ourselves, and even further, to be able to achieve the goal of success. So, we must first understand how to succeed?</p>
<p>A successful person cannot lack knowledge, experience, cultivation, and effort, and even less can he lack the basic psychology of enjoying his work. Enjoying one's work refers to the love of one's profession and treating it as a lifelong career, enjoying it without fatigue, taking on complaints and hard work without any concern. Most of the world's industrial and commercial figures are created by the psychology of enjoying their work. They are diligent and strive forward every day, without any complacency, and constantly struggle. As such, even if there are any difficulties, they will be able to overcome them. My country's industry and commerce are backward, and we should have the psychology of enjoying our work. It is not only closely related to personal achievements, but also has a considerable impact on the prosperity and decline of the national economy.</p>
<p>Although in the past few years, I think there have also been those who have been lucky enough to achieve success and become wealthy merchants. In the enemy and puppet era, everything was abnormal, but in the future, there will definitely be no luck in achieving success. We must know that the psychology of luck is the shadow of success in a career, and we must not have it in our minds again. We must regard the psychology of luck as an obstacle to success. In the current era, everyone should rise up, make the best use of their talents, and rush into the progressive society to become a hard-won successful person. Moreover, in production and construction, we can also achieve good results.</p>
<h3>Introduction to Industrial and Commercial Management</h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>(3) The Talent Problem</p>
<p>No matter what, to achieve success, you need the right talent. It is true that "things are done by people." In the operation of a business, you need even more talent.</p>
<p>This time, after eight years of the War of Resistance, many talents have left their original jobs and changed their professions. Many talents who originally possessed considerable morality have become bad elements due to the bad environment. Therefore, in the past eight years, talent has only decreased and has not increased. For the sake of future development, the cultivation of talent is really a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>According to the principles of management, a perfect management talent must have the following components, which can be used as a reference for cultivating or selecting talents:</p>
<p>1.  Ambition: A person who wants to progress must first have ambition. If he hopes to be able to achieve that step, he should have that kind of ambition as early as possible. The founder of the American Tobacco Company, Duke, helped his father sort out tobacco leaves when he was young. At that time, he felt that the tobacco business had a lot of development potential, so he was determined to develop in this area. As a result, because he had ambition first, and then went through continuous efforts, he finally succeeded.</p>
<p>2.  Knowledge: A person's knowledge is the accumulation of experience obtained indirectly or directly. When we join a business and start serving, we should always pay attention. We should study everything we can get in touch with.</p>
<p>3.  Creative Spirit: People with management skills are mostly creative. When they see something that should be reformed, they go ahead and reform it. Once upon a time, a person was buying things in a department store in Chicago. While waiting for the goods to be wrapped, he saw a young clerk walk up to the manager and suggest that the arrangement of that part should be reformed, and explained the method of reform. The situation at that time gave him a deep impression. That young clerk later became the owner of London's largest department store, Gordon Selfridge.</p>
<p>4.  Thoroughness: To take on major affairs, a person should be able to do various things very thoroughly, observe them meticulously, and work perfectly. A person who can do things thoroughly can take on greater responsibilities.</p>
<p>5.  Analytical Power: This point is a bit similar to the fourth point. Many management talents who have not been trained judge things according to the surface of things and do not delve into the details of things. If he is a truly capable management talent, then when he wants to solve a problem, he must analyze it in detail, and see all aspects of the matter—the good aspects and the bad aspects—as well as the various interests and relations.</p>
<p>6.  Judgment: With analytical power, if there is no judgment ability, then things still cannot be carried out, and sometimes many good opportunities will be missed. Especially in modern times, everything must be decided in the shortest period of time, so if there is no judgment ability, there can be no quick decision, which will delay affairs if small, and mislead the great plans of the business if large.</p>
<p>7.  Organizational Ability: Since a business cannot be carried out by one person or one single part, a responsible authority must have the ability to organize, so that each part can cooperate fully, the progress of affairs is very smooth, and the relationship between colleagues is very harmonious.</p>
<p>8.  Concrete Ideals: A person's ideals are the primary condition for his progress. If there is no ideal, there will be no progress, but his ideal should be concrete, otherwise there will be no possibility of realization.</p>
<p>9.  Ability to Adapt to the Environment: A management talent must have the ability to adapt to the environment, because in front of him, suddenly there are many documents piled up, waiting to be processed urgently, and suddenly he has to deal with foreign guests. If he does not have the ability to adapt to the environment, then he will definitely get flustered and disorderly, and it will also be enough to affect his judgment ability.</p>
<p>10. Leadership Talent: This is related to organizational talent. A management talent must have a kind of leadership skill. He can direct others to implement his ideas and can cooperate with them to jointly handle the progress of affairs.</p>
<p>11. Elegant Demeanor: In today's various environments, impression is very important. If a person can give a good impression, it is very helpful for his own progress and the progress of affairs. To have an elegant demeanor, he must have a strong physique and excellent etiquette in dealing with people.</p>
<p>12. Ability to Apply Various Principles: To be a management talent, you must be able to apply various principles, because to promote a business, there must be reasonable arrangements everywhere. If there is no ability to apply principles, then it is often easy to act on personal impulse and will not succeed.</p>
