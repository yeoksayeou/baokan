<p>〔法新聞社長春卅日電〕（遲到）據當地某銀行家談稱：共軍在佔領長春五星期內，共發行紙幣七千萬元，彼等幷由日本技術人員協助，自中央銀行長春分行保險箱內取去貴重物品，且有「金條若干在內」。代理市長尙傳道亦云：當地所有銀行即將復業，以便推動經濟活動。此間糧食供應，幷無恐慌之象，但數日以來物價已見高漲。</p>
<h3>國防部正式成立　白部長陳參謀總長致訓　陳氏與馬歇爾定明日赴蘇閱軍</h3>

<h3>蘇百餘萬斤糧食　倉庫內聽任霉爛</h3>
<p>縣府接收移充善舉</p>
<p>〔本報蘇州一日電〕蘇敵偽遺下之倉庫不下百數十處，其中物資多至不可勝計，尤以糧食為大宗。自去年九月開始接收，雖曾數度輾轉移交，而始終在保管狀態中，未聞任何處置消息。九月以來，霉爛極多，際此糧價騰湧，民不聊生之時，棄此可貴之糧食，聽任霉爛，社會矛盾莫此為甚，人心怨毒，以期為極，軍政部收繳降軍武裝物資第二騐收組，有鑒及此，特准將各倉庫霉爛糧食，散給貧民，聊以救濟。昨函縣府咨照具領散放，以期普惠貧黎，縣府准函後，以糧食數量甚鉅，設一次散發，僅屬消極之救濟而已，爰決定將此項糧食，移充慈善事業基金，用垂久遠，並組織接收蘇州各倉庫霉爛糧秣委員會　以專責妥愼處理。據悉該項糧食包括米麥荳麵共的一百一十四萬六千餘公斤，惜乎均已霉一爛矣。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕此間和平日報記者，頃與某觀察家談及民主同盟對目前時　態度問題，據云：民盟人士如張君勱等，態度尙稱公正，惜未能把握民盟實權。至羅隆基，　伯鈞等所謂民盟親共派者，完全為共產黨說話，為共產黨掩護，已為時人所盡知。例如，一　間協商會議每次討論至國大問題時，共黨堅持代表重選，民盟即隨聲附和，日昨民盟又暗中為共產黨發言，攻擊美國，認美國援助國軍北上，實為不解，其實美國援助國軍接收主權，乃美國對同盟國應盡之義務，亦國人所週知者。共產黨用暴力，在東北阻撓國軍接收失敗，轉恨美國，但又不敢公然提出反美，乃假民盟親共派出之，明眼人莫不洞若觀火。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京一日電〕此間觀察家認為：最近高級官員及將領所發表之談話，已闡明政府對共產黨之政策，現惟待分析共黨所持之暖昧態度，僉謂：孫科，熊式輝，杜聿明所發表之談話·已闡明政府決定以任何代價，接收整個東北。至共黨可能採取之方針有三：（一）共　或將堅持武力到底，（二）或將放棄其要求，（三）或將拖延時間，衆料共黨自知兵力單簿及全國和平之呼聲，或不致採取第一項方針，最可能者為拖延方針。</p>

<p>星期論壇</p>
<h3>東北問題的幾種看法</h3>
<p>— 蔣君章</p>
<p>（一）緒言</p>
<p>東北問題的發展，真是波瀾迭起，使我們焦慮·惶恐·憂　·　慨。我們知道：開羅會議的宣言，確定了我們在東北的主權，中蘇友好同盟條約確定了日本潰敗以後中蘇交接東北的具體辦法。這是東北問題由黑暗轉到光明的時間。但自去年九月以後，共軍得到先國軍而進入東北的便利，蘇軍的撤退一再延期，於是曙光初見的東北問題，重又陰霾密布。到了蘇軍自　長撤退，共軍侵佔長春·哈爾濱·等重要據點，而且紛紛成立「政權」，東北問題更進入嚴重關頭。現在國軍收復長春，繼續北進，只要共黨能夠看明大勢，認淸國家此時需要統一，自動放棄哈爾濱·齊齊哈爾·及中長鐵路沿綫的割據企圖，東北問題未始不可重見光明。</p>
<p>作者以為東北問題的　結所在，可分為內在困難和外在困難兩部份，如果僅僅是內在困難或僅僅是外在困難，解決還是容易，無奈這東北問題是內外交感的疑難雜症，在相互影響之下，弄得盤根錯節，若共黨還未放棄假借外力割據地盤的妄念，則勢必離開有利於國家民族的解決途徑，愈去愈遠。作者不　，有鑒於認淸東北問題的重要，特從世界局勢，中國前途，中共目的等幾方面，把東北問題的性質，作一扼要的檢討。</p>
<p>（二）從國際看東北問題</p>
<p>東北問題，不是單純的中蘇之間的問題，而是整個世界和平問題　中的一個主要部份。尤其是在蘇聯現行的國策下，我們更堅信東北問題是飲食國際性。蘇聯現行的國策是什麼？蘇聯當局沒有向世界宣布，。但許多事實或可帮助我們瞭解它。</p>
<p>蘇聯的西方，原來是縮在芬蘭　的東端，在德波戰　期中，蘇聯吞并了愛沙尼·拉特維亞·立陶宛和波蘭的東部。現在的波蘭政府，其前身是蘇聯卵翼下的波蘭解放委員會，對於蘇聯政策自是亦步亦趨的；波蘭的領土，將來可以擴及德國的東部。蘇聯的西南方，他旣收捷克斯拉夫於其掌握之中，又所羅馬尼亞·保加利亞·匈牙利·南斯拉夫置於卵翼之下。中歐的奧國已經是蘇聯的必爭之物，而　處巴爾幹南端的希臘以及地跨歐　當黑海門戶的土耳其，也已成了蘇聯集中注意之地區。蘇聯的南方，則有伊朗問題。伊朗不是有功於蘇聯的抗德，而且德黑　會議後曾與英美兩國共同發表宣言尊重其主權與獨立的國家嗎？可是蘇軍現雖勉強撤退，而蘇軍駐防區內發生反國家的自治運動，一直到現在　　不淸。再看蘇聯東南方的我們新疆·蒙古·和東北，蒙古在蘇聯駐軍之下脫離了我們祖國已在二十年以上，現在又經中蘇友好同盟條約的換文而取得獨立了。新疆的伊犂事變，對中國所造成的局面，正和亞塞爾拜然自治運動對伊朗所造成的局面一樣。至於東北問題，讓中共部隊取得進入的便利，製成東北這一個月來的戰火，將來是否另有演變，此時還不能臆測。</p>
<p>由上述種種，我們可以看出蘇聯戰後一部份的國策，就是：</p>
<p>第一，擴展本國的邊境。這邊疆照目前的形勢，在西方是已經達到帝俄時代的程度；在東方蘇聯領袖也明白提出恢復帝俄時代權利的要求，事實上也相當做到；在伊朗，帝俄和英劃定勢力範圍，第一次世界大戰中英俄共　了伊朗，這次亞省事件，則似已更進一步；在巴爾幹方面，實現了帝俄大斯拉夫主義的政策，可謂有優越的成就。</p>
<p>第二，蘇聯擴展邊境的方式，可以分作下列數種：其一，併人蘇聯版國或組織社會主義共和國加入蘇維埃聯邦；其二，樹立親蘇政府，使成為蘇聯的外國份子，捷克即為一例；其三，樹立共產黨政權，造成鄰邦割據的局面，使蘇聯的鄰境不復有統一的強大的國家出現。</p>
<p>第三，蘇聯製造親蘇政權或共黨政權，常用的方式是駐軍期內發展共產黨或類似共產黨的組織，其號召或以民主，或以民族，視當地之環境而異。</p>
<p>我們瞭解上述的國際形勢和蘇聯國　一部份後，便可知道東北問題的發生和發展，是有其時代的背景，和蘇聯國策有其不可分離的關係。簡單地說，蘇聯在施行樹立親蘇或共產主義的外衛政權，是要使他的鄰國都要變成易於控制的弱國或小國。我們中國政府所推行的國策，對外是親蘇聯美，盡量想把美蘇兩國因中國居間的關係而得到接近和親善。尤其是經濟發展，中國對國外的帮助，無論美蘇，原是無分軒輊的歡迎。中國的建設，是在乎本身的富強康樂和獨立自主權益的確保。因此，中國對內對外所推行的政策，在蘇聯看來，或許和蘇聯所推行的政策有些鑿　，尤其是中國和美國一接近，更使蘇聯懷疑到未來強大的中國，可能予蘇聯以重大的不利，因而加強其原有政策的施行。蘇聯對東北的種種，以及中共在東北的亂攪，便是在此種想像中釀成的。</p>
<p>（三）從中共看東北問題</p>
<p>中共是現在東北問題發展的要角，因此中共對東北問題的如何看法，我們應加注意。我們要瞭解中共的看法，須先瞭解下列幾點：</p>
<p>第一，中共是一個以馬列主義為號召的政黨。這種主義在政治活動的特點是以武裝暴動的手段奪取政權，是以一黨專政的方法創造社會主義的國家。這社會主義國家有一個祖國，聽從社會主義祖國的命令，是神聖的義務。中國共產黨旣然是馬列主義的政黨，自然也具有這些特色。還有一點，馬列主義的政黨，自己號稱最進步的政黨，社會主義國家也是號稱最新式的民主國家。惟其如此，他們看人家總帶着幾分不信任和歧視的態度，而懷疑猜忌似乎成了他們的天性。因此，和中共談判要講信用，是萬分困難的事情。</p>
<p>第二，中共旣是馬列主義政黨，有聽從社會主義祖國命令的神聖義務，所以中共看東北問題，與其說是站在中國利害的市場上看的，毋寗說它是站在蘇聯利害的立場看的。事實上，中共也不能不如此，因為中共如果以民族和國家的立場來代替社會主義祖國的立場，就會得立刻失去蘇聯的信任。反之，國民政府如果能遷就蘇聯之利害來打算東北問題，那末蘇聯也許會拿給與中共的便利給國民政府。</p>
<p>第三，中共旣是一貫的以武裝暴動奪取政權為中心主張，所謂和平　所謂協商等等，自然不過是利用一時的姿態。中共心目中的有利條件是國家混亂，是人民不安，是到處恐怖，而不是安定與富強。這一點和蘇聯現時推行的一部份國策，又是相合的。在這裏，我們可以附帶瞭解中共密令所謂　不斷的衝突，不斷的談判」的宣傳政策。中國經過八年多的抗戰，人心厭亂，渴望安居樂業，和平統一。這是一個大潮流，違反不得。然而這個大潮流，恰和中共的有利條件相反，怎樣把這個相反的潮流來加以利用，使牠變成一個有利於中共的因素呢？中共的方法是這樣的：當日本初降時，他一方面向政府爭受降權，一方面　下七個命令，向大城市·交通中心·和交通線進攻，在起義·光復·解放的名義下，擴大了佔領區，製造內戰的準備基礎，同時他卻提出反內戰。和平運動等口號，乃至協商停戰等做法，表面上蘄求和平，而實則用以保障其佔領區。可是決議是決議，行動是行動，而決然議以後的宣傳，一定又竭力渲染對方　壞決議，以便再來一次襲擊，使澡國人士不疑心他們在反對和平，阻撓統一。</p>
<p>第四，就中共本身來說，他自從湘贛暴動，贛南成立蘇維埃，以至二萬五千里長征到陜北的延安區，都是在內地，都是和社會主義祖國隔離得很遠，換言之都是孤軍奮鬬於苦瘠之地，發展是非常困難的。因此，中共在　取張家口以後，便有舍延安而移其中心於張垣之趨向，而東北人口旣多，資源又富，又與和社會主義祖國三面鄰接，自然是中共理想的基地。日本人霸佔東北的時期，中共的部隊混不進去，這在中共說來是一個重大的遺憾。這次在蘇軍卵翼下中共割據東北城市，所差的是一個法律問題，因此中共及其外國份子提出東北問題須由協商解決的口號，一方面盡量利用機會，造就現成事實，一方面盡量宣傳，委卸責任於他方，得不到協商解決時，不惜使用武力，並以全面內戰作為後盾。這就是表示了中共對東北是自視為囊中物的。</p>
<p>我們必須要注意東北問題發展的事實。政府根據中蘇友好同盟條約及其附件，要求　　軍隊，建立政府機構，經過了多少的折衝談判，　得到一些結果，而蘇軍的撤退，更費了多少往還，浪費了多少時間才實現了一部份，故中共是否放棄割據東北的企圖，乃是今後國內和平問題的重大關鍵所在。　（下轉第三版）</p>

<h3>在通達遠東交通綫上　英國的兩個疙瘩　埃及與巴勒斯坦（下）</h3>
<p>— 本報倫敦特約記者　雪岩</p>
<p>討好阿剌伯　便得罪了猶太人</p>
<p>從埃及東望，隔着紅海，便是巴勒斯坦。巴勒斯坦是第一次大戰，土耳其帝國瓦解後英國繼承的一筆遺產，由國際聯盟交托於英國委任統治，現在也成為一片是非之場。早在一九一七年，歐戰未結束，這片土地屬英屬法未決定時，英已屬意此土，外相貝爾福傾發表大名鼎鼎的貝　　聲明，說要拿這片土來安頓流離失所的猶太人，把化成猶太人的民族家園。但同時也聲明以不妨害原住人民的牛際爲原則。這響亮的宣言，博得不少米聲，結果國縣就以此地委任英國照這原則統治。但說也奇怪，貝爾福聲明雖簡明響亮，無如實行起來，却異常困難。討好了生長在當地的阿剌伯人，便得罪猶太人。反之亦然。二者互相水火，始終未能調和。兼以阿剌伯人民族黨識的逐漸普及與移人猶太人的數目日益增大，衝突就沒有停止過。英國雖派過好幾次調查團，謀籌折中二便的解決法，結果從未圓滿。表面的安寗，都要靠武裝軍力來鎮壓的。迨去年年底，英政府徵得美國的同意，再派英美聯合調查團，前往調查真相，限於一百二十日內，提出報告並建議，供兩國政府參考採納。英外相貝文在宣布此項政策時，還說其成功與否，願以其政治前途作賭，足見其信心之大了。</p>
<p>調查團建議</p>
<p>打不開兩難僵局</p>
<p>這政策宣布後，調查團人員，即查定組織，着手工作。不待限期到達，報告盡已經提出，其中有建議十點，與英國現行政策頗相反。英政府經過一星期的研究後，才由首相艾德禮向下院提出報告，謂在充分商詢美國政府的意見前，不加批評。並且暗示，英政府對報告書中的十點建議，要採納的話就全部採納，否則，不考慮某中某一部份。但美國政府的意見，似乎恰好相反，美總統杜魯門經過研究後，發表批評，祗指出美國政府向來所贊成的一點，說很好很好，對建議中的其餘各點，却不贊一詞。同時，當調查團工作進行時，猶太人反對非常猛烈，英國親調大兵到巴勒斯坦去鎮壓，結果還常發生猶太人所發動的恐怖事件。迨這次報告書發表後，猶太人經過研究後，却默認了。反之，阿剌伯人，在調查過程中，頗為安靜，但報告書發表後，却立示不妥，已提出決心反對的警告。原來報告書的內容，稍偏袒猶太人。將來如果實行，猶太人的反抗，搗亂，或則可望寗靜下去，阿剌伯人的叛亂，必代之而起，反之，如擱置不行，又沒有其他較好的新辦法，則現在巴勒斯坦，猶太人所主動的騷亂，仍無法鬆弛。美國內部，因猶太人甚多，所以關切猶太人的前途。反之，英國治下，甚多阿剌伯人，所以要顧慮到阿剌伯人的反抗。這次調查團的建議，恐非不能打開這兩難的僵局，且暴露英美對這方面意見的參差。</p>
<p>目標先確定</p>
<p>兩民族躋於平等</p>
<p>至於調查團的十點建議，總括起來，可簡述如次：現在歐洲各地，受納粹茶毒後，猶太人的生活甚慘。世界各國，都應開放移民門戶，准許猶太人移入。巴勒斯坦是猶太人最願意去的地方，自應准甚移入。不過巴基斯坦一地，容納不了這許多猶太人，所以須各國分担。在各種問題未商妥前，先於一年內准許十萬人移往巴勒斯坦。這十萬人移入後，巴勒斯坦繼續開放，每年移入的人數，應依生產能力來決定。鑒於當地阿拉伯人和猶太人的互相水火，巴勒斯坦暫時不能聽其獨立，應由委任統治國繼綫責任，以後在聯合國託治　下治理。且先決定目標，既不使其成為阿剌伯國家，亦不成為猶太人國，而爲兩個民族共存共榮的國家。同時，巴勒斯坦應努力開發富源，建設水利計劃，俾能養活日益增加的人民。此外，更須設法提高阿剌伯人的生活與教育水準，務使其與猶太人相等，庶能達到兩民族真正平等，無庸相互猜疑的程度。</p>
<p>這建設中，雖不少崇高遠大的計劃。但崇高而遠大者，都不免為期久遠，前途茫茫，不切實用。反之，移入猶太人一點，則非常具體，可以立見分曉，而且一年內移入的十萬人，更是要立即辦理的。我們知道巴勒斯坦是小地方，生產亦不甚當，至多祗能容納二百餘萬人罷了，現在已有人口約一百八十萬，阿剌伯人與猶太人的數目，爲一一與比之。不說以後選　續多入，單是這十萬人羅進去，已經感到很大的重量了。阿剌伯人反對者以比。其次阿剌伯人現要求獨立，建議中說不可，自然也爲反對的原因之一了。反之提高教育及生活水準，是相當空洞的話，至於二民族共存共榮之說，尤無保障，一旦猶太人佔了多數，阿剌伯決難再望平等了。所以阿剌伯人反對這建議，寗無是當然的。（完）</p>
<h3>東北問題的幾種看法　上接第二版星期論</h3>
<p>（四）從中國看東北</p>
<p>我們中國人自己對東北問題的看法，大多數人都抱着一個見解，那就是東北是我們中國的領土，中國人的生命線。我們八年抗戰的目的是收回東北，我們的收回東北；早經各盟邦的同意，就是蘇聯也在中蘇友好同盟條約中給與我們明確的規定。在法理上，我們已有充分的根據，而事實演變，竟致弄到如此混亂，真是感慨萬千，忍耐性是一點的，已經悲憤得不可言狀了。</p>
<p>我們中國人都深切瞭解，東北和我們華北是有層　相依，安危與共的關係。我們中國的歷史，充分證明了這一個關係。不用說遠的，就拿宋明兩代來說，契丹，遼，金，　起於　遼，宋始終是偈促偏安；清起於建州以後，明始終疲於遼東的防守，終以此而亡國。再看九一八以後，東北人日本的掌握，我們的華北更是　　不安，有岌岌不可終日之勢。因此，我們中國人堅決要求東北特殊化不容存在，東北必須統一於國家的中央政府之下。我們不能容忍抗戰勝利以後的局面竟復見於今日。我們不忍想像兩宋的結局和明的結局是什麽？我們更不忍回憶九一八後的結局是什麽？因此，我們必須要未雨綢繆，劃除一切惡因，以免再行發生惡果。</p>
<p>我們更瞭解空槽時代高絲度地區對空中運輸和國防土　　偵。美國前任副總統　來士先生曾經訪問過我們戰時的　都，他的行程是經過新疆的，他說：「我是從中國的正門來的。」其實，我們的正門有兩道：其一是新疆，另一則爲東北，以中美的空中交通來說，正門實為東北，而新疆猶爲旁門。中國對外軍心的北移，是空中時代必然的結果。這一重門戶和我們國防的關係，將因時代的進展而更形密切。我們中國人保持這重門戶的所有權，也一定因時代的使命而必須加倍努力了！</p>
<p>最後我們更認識一點，那是從東北國際關係的滄桑之　上　認識到的。我們知道這東北在清平，成為日俄兩國的角逐之場。團國勢力的此消彼長，曾經演襲出日俄戰爭的悲劇來。九一八後，日本獨佔東北，幣原就說：「無異看一炸彈」，卒至演成第二次世界大戰。我們推究其原因所在，一言以蔽之，是因爲中國的國勢凌夷。大權旁落。現今的東北情勢，加以國際間的火藥氣味，雖保不會釀成三次世界大戰。我們中國人絕對愛好和平。而且深知戰爭只有毀了中國。故極不願東北問題沒有一種合理的解決。現在世界大局，老實說，美蘇兩國的種種離衆，必然要影響我們中國。尤其是關於朝鮮問題的異見，對我們東北問題的影響格外大，對於世界和平的威脅也格外大。東北如果成立了蘇聯外圍性質的特殊政權。則無異予中國生存以致命打擊。予美國安全和世界和平以重大威脅。只有把東北完整地統屬於中國，在我們不偽不倚的立國政策之下，才可使美蘇兩國由減少摩擦而逐漸接近和諧，共同致力於世界和平基礎的建立。這是我們保有東北的另外一種重大任務。</p>
<p>（五）餘論</p>
<p>總上所述，可知東北問題，一方面是我們國內黨派問題的一個最重要部份，可以說今後國內和平能否維持的關鍵所在，而另一方面却是複雜的國際問題的一角，今後世界和平的維持亦與此大有影響。</p>
<p>其次，我們必須注意到長期抗戰以後的中國，必不能再有長期的混亂。我們人民要用雪亮的眼睛來判別誰是企圖長期混亂的。我們人民要用冷靜的頭腦來對國家觀，民族感，和社會主義　國立場等加以客觀的考察，看那一樣對我們最有利益。我們對於中國共產黨人，也要求他們作上述的考慮。我們需要獨立自主的國家，需要有秩序的社會，需要建設和繁榮，更需要政黨都不忘記它們是中國人所組織的。</p>
<p>復次，我們爲了國家的生存，爲了人民的生活，爲了世界的和平，我們要求不必要的國際糾紛，盡量要避免製造，拿出誠意來爲和平幸福着想。東北是我們生死存亡關鍵所在的區域，中國是一個徒有其名的強國，中國保有東北，決不致爲患世界和平或侵害任何國家的利益。事實上中國目前沒有這種能力，即使將來國力強大以後，也決沒有上述的危險。這在歷史上，在中國民族性的觀點上，都可找出根據的。蘇聯大可不必在中國邊疆一定要另外扶植一個共黨政權作為它的安全保障的。</p>
<p>最後我們還要對中共有一種懇切的期望。其一，社會主義祖國的立場，至少在最近幾十年的中國還不能號召，尤其與中國的民族性和歷史教育的精神相違反，必然此路不通。任何高明的手段，巧妙的宣傳，如果不問此義，在中國人面前，必然失去信仰，徒然喪失國家的元氣。犧牲中共的力量而已。其二，武力奪取政權的觀念，要真正取消，還是走民主國家的正道，在議場上用　　用政策來爭取權能。如果仍一味製造混亂與　　，　以奪取政權，其結果是目的難達，而毀壞了國家，殘殺了人民。也破壞了中共自己的黨。假使中共接受這點　　，那末什麽問題都極容易解決，東北問題當然也就不成其為問題，我們人民有權利要求中共接受我們的期望，我們要拿出主人翁的力量來使它接受我們的要求！</p>

<h3>社會局召集工商界　商解救當前危機　谷部長出席宣布政府方針　警告菜蔬肉業　吳市長官不容非法狂漲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市工商界因工潮迭起，原料缺乏，或本昂責，不能與外貨匹敵，營業遂一落千丈，至今幾瀕破產危境，有關當局除作各項有效措置，準備挽救外，社會部長谷正綱日前一度由京來滬，對各工會負責人宣佈政府對處理工潮之方針，嚴禁非法罷工怠工。谷氏昨晨再度來滬，出席下午由社會局召集各同　公會負責人談話會，吳市長亦蒞臨致詞。出席者有社會局吳局長，社會部特派員陸京士，社會局勞工處長趙班斧，市商會主席王曉　，及各業同業公會負責者二百餘人。行禮如儀後，由主席吳開先聲述開會意義，略謂今日之工商危機，各方對之皆感焦慮，日前谷部長已召集各工會負責人指示一切，今日之解決途徑，固不僅靠工人之負起責任及遵守秩序，工商界亦應配合政府方針，協助挽救此危機。</p>
<p>繼由吳市長致調稱：上海爲全國商業中心，進出口幾佔全額百分之九十，故上海之繁榮與否，影響全國至鉅。此次出長滬市，自感責任重大，如何扶　工商業及挽救當前之經濟危機，當為最大責任。各位有何痛苦及不滿，吿訴兄弟，一定逐漸改進，並望官民打成一片，人民與政府同不要有任何隔膜。繼對各出席者聲述數點：（一）提倡節的，希望工商先進，樹立模範，節省人力財力物力，爲建國生產之用。（二）取締投機份子，請各界予以協助。違者決予嚴辦。糧價今已咽跌。此次糧食登記，結果僅四十餘萬担。但據悉各商號皆以存種之六折登記，市府對此並非不知，現已調査清楚，除將五昌米　榮永明重予覊押外，三泰公司未登記米糧三千餘包悉予沒收。現再將登記期限展延至下星期二（六月四日）晚爲止，逾期再不登記，經舉發後決予全部沒收。（三）警吿菜蔬鮮豬兩業之同業公會，近日蔬菜豬肉市價上漲之巨，較米價尤甚，決將予以取締。如有勒索敲詐者，可向市府報吿嚴辦。總之上海之繁榮衰敗，影響全國，除暴安良及如何增加生產，發達商業，爲兄弟之責任，本人曾一本中央政策，貫澈執行，以上海恢復日往之地位。</p>
<h3>處理工潮方針　谷部長作祥細說明</h3>
<p>谷部長繼之致詞，首稱比次本擬邀請經濟部長王雲五同來，現王部長四事未能蒞會，故今日所講，祇限於本部所轄範圍之事，經濟問題，猶待他日王部長蘭述。谷氏稱。此次政府下最大決心改進經濟困難，扶助工商業之正當發展，對於政府處理方針及工商界應有之認識等，說明要點如下：（甲）政府勞工政策及處理目前工潮之方針：一·勞工政策之主要精神：（一）扶助工人組織，改善工人生活，提高勞工地位。（二）促進勞資協調，提高勞動效能，發展生產事業。二·處理工潮方針：（一）工人合法利益應予保障，（二）勞動紀律必須整飭，（三）勞資糾紛應依法定程序處理，四調整工資應依照規定原則辦理。（乙）民族工業家應有之認識：一，求生產事業之發展，應協助政府平定物價，取締投機，以安定社會秩序與生產秩序。二·挽救工業危機不僅要消弭工潮，並應改進一切生產條件。三·增加生產必須注意勞工福利。四·尊重勞工之人格地位及合法權益。五·勞資糾紛應依法處理，始能得到合理之解決。（丙）希望工商界做到之幾點：一·健全工商團體組織，協助穩定物價。二·依照勞工法令，訂立廠規，送經政府核定後切實執行。三·施行工廠會議以促進勞資合作，四·准許工人依法組廠，不應有歧視工會之態度，五。迅遠興辦福利事業，以改善工人生活而增進工作效能，六·　　，資應依照規定辦法辦理。七·非經政府核准，不得無故停業或關廠。八·倍任並服從政府，依法處理勞資糾紛。九·同業間不得互相挖工或擅自提高工資</p>
<h3>穩定物價　需要通力合作</h3>
<p>谷氏稱：穩定物價非僅藉個人力量或政府法令，尙賴同業之認識及合作努力才能收效，政府規定之法令政策，並非對某一階　予以特殊保護，而爲綜合各方面之利益與需要而確定者蓋政府之政策，即人民之要求，故決不偏於一方，關於勞工之福利與生產效率有密切關係，故資方對勞工福利應多多興辦，谷氏並强調今日批判某人之條件，不以財富官爵論之，而以對於人類之貢獻爲標準·故資方應尊重勞工之地位，蓋勞資合作係由互尊互愛而來。言及工會組織，谷部長以寳刀作比喩：可用以殺人亦可用以保護人，此全看如何利用。故工會小一定壞，紙要領導有方，有助於生產頗鉅，故齊方不必聞之即　，而各位要工人守紀律，要政府維持生產紀律，資方亦有甚多必須改進之慮。總之，過去個別單獨之努力已吿失敗，今後應共同合作努力，才能挽救目前之危機。此非）爲某人單獨之利益，而係爲整個民族國家之利益。</p>
<h3>吳市長作結論　宣布治事方針</h3>
<p>關於前日後方來滬失業工人在社會局越規行動之事，谷部長稱：布長體念為失業工人，又爲有功於抗戰生產者，故從寬處理，但　飭勞動紀律，政府定于嚴厲執行·最後由吳市長作結論，宣佈三項治事方針：（一）維護保障正當之工商業以鼓勵生產，（二）取締投機安定物價，（三）提倡節約以裕國濟興。</p>
<p>是時手帕業絲織業等代表紛起向谷部長吳市長等呼籲，聲進當今拆息之重，工人囂張·營業無法維持，迫使瀕於破產之種種危機，並由駱淸華代表工商界歷述各業之困境，當此生死存亡關頭，希黨局予以切實協助與救濟，請谷部長轉向中央申訴，作有效之措置。繼後發言者尙多，因谷部長公忙，當由王曉籟宣佈如有意見可彙呈市商會轉呈谷部）長鑒閱，遂於六時許散會。</p>
<h3>旅業訴苦　限價從將無註維持　旅客負担有增無减</h3>
<p>昨日下午七時，本市旅業商業同業公會，假座杏花樓，招待新聞記者。席間由該會主持人徐文照、孫秋屛，陳松濤等相繼陳述同業之困難情形，大意（一）商業自實行限價以來，因　　　波動之影響，收支無法平衡·致　累甚巨，且引起勞貸糾紛，若不急予改善，勢將無法織持而趨於總崩潰。（二）勞資雙方應互相協助，否則資方無力營業。至推究勞資不能協調之原因，則又爲限價所造成。（三）實行限價後，旅社方面爲　補開支計，不得不增加房價，茶　之　賞，乃贈與性質，旅客爲酬其　待之勞，仍自動給與，故實際上旅客之負担，祗有加重而無减輕。公會現正其呈向市政府，社會局等有關機關，請求恢復原狀，以圖生存云。</p>
<h3>十七家電影院　實行對號入座</h3>
<p>本市首二輪電影院大光明等十七家，已遵奉警察局命令，於昨日起，全部對號入座。此後市警局並將與院方取得密切連繫，取締黑市票等，務使有完好無缺之秩序。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕各該電影院，昨起普遍漲價，最高者達四成以上。</p>
<h3>中航機航組接收　昨日有三機飛出　怠工員工一律解職</h3>

<h3>顚沛流離　生活困苦　僑領黃恩世抵滬談話</h3>

<p>〔聯合社紐卅一日電〕出席倫敦聯合國敎育科學文化協會之美國代表團專門秘書胡夫德談稱：吾人必須以敎育使人深信不需要戰事，否則聯合國機構及其他任何安定機構，亦不過裝飾品而已。吾人必須擬定一種世界性之「和平敎育」計劃，而以敎室，無線電，報紙，電影，及演說等爲傳播此種敎育之媒介。和平敎育應包括以下數點：（一）敎育各國人民，使知如何充分利用其國內資源，以提高生活標準。（二）擁有資源之民族，將其物資分與無物資之民族。（三）提高國際個人之道德。此外如國際共管原子能，以食糧賑濟飢民，託管防禦基地，交換新聞，情報及留學生，以及鏟除敎科書內之偏激思想等，均可增進國際友誼而消除仇視心理。爲使世界各地文化及敎育中心恢復舊觀，美國應捐助一億五千萬元，以促其成。此足以防止文化衰落，並使世人得循藝術與科學途以徑行自救。</p>

<p>（一）胡波年問我姊廿六歲，於去年十月間起，手足指常慘白麻木，血液中止，約五六分鐘即恢復原狀診醫云四肢血管神經之病無礙，然日見病勢增劇，白至手掌與全足，月前忽膝節痛，繼而頭頸背腰以及兩腿，痛不能忍，且不能動，飲食漸減，終日强飲薄粥，精神　靡，請問這種現象是否神經痛　服何藥？有否特效藥及專科醫師？</p>
<p>（余新恩博士答）病名雷那德氏病，係爲血管神經的紊亂所致，無特效藥，可試服甲狀腺，及局部施行熬敷及按摩，如無效可試用手術。</p>
<p>（二）李杏園問　素稔貴欄熱心為社會服務，各界人士，得益非淺。家母患胃病已十餘載，現年五十七歲，病初尙能食小蘇打治之，旋因前年三哥亡去，去歲四姐病死，並連遭敵僞下鄕恐嚇，以致三年來病情加重，小蘇打服後不復有效，最近上身疼痛，時常嘔吐，並曾吐過咖啡色絲狀血物，飲食不進，顧請中西醫師，治療無效，醫云係胃癌，謂示治法</p>
<p>（余新恩博士答）確係胃癌，如初起可以割治，迨已轉移，則手術無效，服藥及土方絕對無效。</p>

<p>（張仲明醫師答）（一）此係面疱，能自愈，若用擠出之白色漿液製成漿苗，再注射體內，可早日治愈，此即所謂自體菌苗療法。（二）貴恙若用百分之五水柳楊酸酒精溶液擦頭，可有效。</p>

<h3>節關迫近銀根抽緊　金鈔均告疲落　公債股票全面回跌</h3>
<p>鑰赤昨漸平定，涌開稍穩，開後紛有說手，逐步降低至一七八萬而稍平，十時後在一七九萬左右盤旋，中行配給二十一條，價一七八萬五，此後始終在一七九萬前後掙扎，午後更形平庸，結果較前收回跌三萬光景，飾金十九萬，紋銀銀元均平，暗拆求供不一，投掛帮方面鬆而外行均緊，息價內行一角三至一角半，外界一角八至二角。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔平穩，高價二三三五元，低價二三一〇元，盤頭殊窄，延至午刻仍在二三〇元左右掙扎，午後亦然，結果較前收微挫五元，港票復有貶値之謠，回小五元左右，羅比及港電匯仍在前價兜售，美匯明暗均未更動，交易均難暢達。</p>
<p>公債昨初疲後穩，低後有某染織業游資收買，市氣復吿活躍，統丙晨開六七〇〇元，不久復降至六五〇〇元以下，始有維持，中途一度盤升至六八五〇元左右，但多方亦難支持，續來斬售，又降至六五〇〇元，午刻略穩，結果較前收仍跌三百元，甲乙跌一五〇元，丁種跌二百元，戊種挫一百元，華股仍吿鬆懈，買戶遂望風暫止，永紗自六〇八〇元步降至五七五〇元，美亞四五三〇元退至四三〇〇元，景福三一三元降至二九〇元，新光三一〇元退至二八三元，勤興二二五元降至二〇八元，近午微穩，結果較前收永紗美亞景福新光動興各跌半成左右，中型各股雖挫而有限，小型冷門復跌半成，各元老股復吿供過於求，收後喊價恍惚，外股晨開平穩，怡紗在一一八〇〇元掙扎，迨後浮多續來了結，開後退至一一二〇〇元光景，北帮金融界收買。疲後稍穩，結果較前收除怡紗居熱股之首，未見榮辱外，餘者復小半成左右。</p>
<h3>紗價逐步下降　現棉交易尚佳</h3>
<p>昨日紗市又轉平疲，綠客銷不繼，金價回落，雙馬晨初尙定，終以出籠者衆，逐步下降，至一百三十萬，其餘各支亦較昨回小一二萬元，四十二支藍鳳因上日紡建對廠家有藍鳳雙股供售，致市上需要减少，價遂不支而退，以二百五十二萬收市，計跌六萬之多。　昨“紐的美棉電訊報漲十至十二磅音，計近期美金二八·〇五，遠期二八·六三，米特林現貨二八·六七，本埠現棉交易尙佳，民營紗廠稍有採辦，浦東火機花十六支原料送廠價高至十萬元，已與細絨原料並駕齊驅。</p>
<h3>布市稍形平軟</h3>
<p>布市獲利者吐售，同時又値中紡開售之期，多方稍稍脫手，因此檯面轉趨鬆懈，上午行市，坯布嗶嘰跌五百元至一千元，惟士林布漸入旺季，市態已不若昔日之呆滯，午後聞中紡掛牌開售之貨，依然寥寥無幾，十二磅細布僅V龍頭一種，三A彩球限於漂染廠方可承購，淡綠嗶嘰則自一三二號起至一〇四二號止，僅有三十四戶，每戶分配二十疋云。</p>
<h3>桕油漸見好轉</h3>
<p>柏油自皂廠辦後，形勢漸見好轉，本埠所存客貨已開去十之七八，價格大部份爲四萬元，而高貨反少主顧，蓋各配銷塲，各行家存底尙不見薄，因進出可抵，不致枯乏，惟客貨稍薄耳，現在漢口及杭州市均相仿，與滬上價亦相近，故由此運彼，似不合算，因之來貨不甚熱鬧，若天時炎熱，皂用繼續，或再起色，亦未可知，行家售皂廠已至五萬元，司馬秤，送廠交貨，售淘用本車六萬元，內坪油五萬二千元，的干油五萬元，獨砠四萬八千元，蘭油四萬五千元，麻城油四萬二千元。</p>
<h3>中農推廣農貸　滬區達六十億</h3>
<p>激後饞村凋蔽，中農行在滬復業後，即積極舉辦農貸，對肥料，棉花，漁業，農具，茶葉各糧貸款，均分別辦理，目前該行則側重蠶絲貸款，無錫，江陰，蘇州，吳江等產蠶區域，該行均派員直接貸與蠶廣，並在無錫，蘇州兩處設農貸辦本處，便利蠶農，此次該行舉辦之蠶絲貸款，凡蠶種生產，加工，至運鐘等，均分別貸與款項，聞已貸出十四億一千萬元，其中烘繭，抵押兩項，佔七億七千萬元，週息四分，期限三個月，現蠶繭登市，每担市價僅十萬元，而實際成本則爲十五萬，今後市價是否上漲，縱上漲以後，能否超升十五萬元以上，大成問題，聞中農行決盡量擴大農貸範圍，除蠶絲貸款十四億一千萬元外，肥料，茶葉，漁貸，綿布等共已貸五十一億一千萬元，其中肥料貸款，在江陰，奉賢，松江，金山，南匯，蘇州，常熟，崑山等八縣貸出六億億元，棉花貸款，在太倉，嘉定兩縣，貸出一億六千萬元，土布貸款，在江陰貸出一億五千萬元，本市漁貸爲二億元，茶葉貸款爲四十億元。</p>
<h3>越級上升·緩步下降　米價再小千餘元　糧政處訂購越米將到　售價將不超過四萬元</h3>
<p>昨日米市去化益懈，受主難覓，粳秈元米一致下降千餘元，麵粉再小一二百元，黃豆到消兩平，市面平和，赤豆貨稀，挺秀千餘元苞米步削千餘元，菉豆提高殺次，新蠶豆本街另化土路香燥，價升二三千元，豆餅納戶看望，形勢疲軟，見小二三百元，油市早堅午淡，據米市塲息，昨日本市到米，計白粳等七種，共七千餘石，其種類及石數如下，白粳三，五七八石，薄稻九三六石，早稻九〇一石，羊秈四一五石，杜秈一七七石，蕪秈八八八石，白元三五四石，</p>
<p>又訊，據糧政特派員辦公處消息，該處向美加諸國洽購大批食糧外，復就近向安南遷羅等地直接採購，最近該處向安南訂購食米，已由海防轉運，日內即可抵滬，該處決以最低價出售，每担售價不超過四萬元，至於銷售方式，並不向米市塲拋售，另定公允之配售辦法，以後如來米衆多，將依照戶口配售辦法辦理，聞官商向越南訂購之食米，六月中將有萬除噸絡繹來滬。</p>
<h3>絲經交易稀　綢貨一致報漲　工價捐稅太高</h3>
<p>昨日一二〇號大橋人絲有光現貨，首先喊一百四十萬元，最小喊價一百三十四五萬元，最後做一百三十七八萬元，較上日小二萬元，交易淸淡，人心軟弱，大致未能看好，廠絲七五分勻度普通貨，昨日連納有十餘包購進，價做二百十二萬五千元，用戶絲價頗平穩，干經有杭客採辦，售價均喊高四五萬元，不過成交甚稀，綢貨續好，美亞被面每百條高一萬元，大誠格子璧縐每碼四千三百六十元，較上日漲起五十元，杭貨羅紡，因工價增加，一致報漲，盛澤貨亦不能例外，日聞將有地方捐稅徵收，是則到申成本又須高漲。</p>
<h3>呢絨白貨下跌</h3>
<p>呢絨市面，因値靑黃不接之時，兼預售减少，本街客帮諸買方，採辦莫不延遲，刻除應時實銷貨堅立外，悉多平平，昨如白嗶嘰白直貢，白凡而頂白雪克司頂等莫不普遍下跌，蓋其售價之昂。已達極頂，雖跌三二千元一碼，仍難銷出，而洗濯費貴及生活程度高壓，亦其一因也。</p>
<h3>湖州新炒青看好</h3>
<p>茶市內銷花色，本街店莊及蘇，錫，津等地，均有去化，因此買氣不餒，而供應亦亟相應，故趨勢賡續堅定，然湖州新炒靑，自登塲以來，即受本　同業之靑睞，惜該項花色、到存兩稀，刻下雙方雖有談判，惟持者大肆居奇，預料前途，當有一番豐采</p>
<h3>糖價繼續上漲</h3>

<p>三萬噸糧食由川運濟京滬之運價，　經糧食部與各輪船公司訂定，（一）渝宜每噸爲九一·二〇〇元，加阿空津貼五七·〇〇〇元，（二）渝漢每噸一二四·八〇〇元，加回空津貼七八，〇〇〇元，（三）渝京每噸一五八·四〇〇元，加回空津貼九九·〇〇〇元，上項運價，相等於商貨運價，其同空津貼爲補助性質，各輪船公司均表滿意。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕蔣主席月中手令加緊川糧運輸，船舶調配委員會即增撥輪隻，加强渝宜運輸，但各輪抵宜後，因故繼續下駛，故渝宜運量實少增加，據統計自五月一日至廿七日止，計運出一千三百四十五噸云。</p>
<h3>又一國營機關　中國石油公司　資本總額暫定國幣十萬萬元　翁文灝任董事長並兼總經理</h3>
<p>國營中國石油公司於昨晨九時正式成立，行政院副院長兼該公司董事長翁文灝氏，特由京來滬主持開幕，儀式甚爲簡單，本市經濟界紛往道賀，該公司資本總額暫定爲國幣十萬萬元，總經理由翁董事長兼任，協理爲張茲匯金開英嚴爽郭可設，聞所有敵僞石油廠，一律將移交該公司接管，據翁氏云，我國因工業落後，地質方面，往昔亦欠精詳調查與記載，抗戰以前，僅在陜西方面作小規模之油田鑽探工作，直至對日開戰以後，因沿海遭敵封鎖，國外油料斷絕，政府爲堅持抗戰，增進燃料生產，乃以最大力量與決心，設立甘肅油礦局，在甘省之玉門縣老君廟地方，作地質調査及鑽探開採，煉油等過程後而完成九個油田，月產石油四十餘萬加命，此項石油完全接濟西北交通，對抗戰貢獻甚大，而四川省之隆昌及南岸之石油溝江油三地，經專家數年來之努力，已將地質及鑽探兩項工程完成，現已有天然氣出產，咸認爲該三地蘊藏油量甚豐，現正由四川油礦採勘處負責開採與煉油設計工程，勝利以後所接收台灣之油礦及煉油廠，該處廠礦雖稍具規模，而油產甚少，故油田亦欠精，該公司今後將在台省添置新式煉油機器，以期大量生產，東北方面亦接收有幾個煉油廠礦，該處均是以煤質提煉油，如錦西油廠及大連油廠等，據調査結果，設備尙完整，但產量有限，現該公司成立後，將督導全國油礦油廠，依照步驟，逐一開工，而各廠礦之技術與設備，亦視其實情而予以改進和添置，期在數年後，我國石油能自給自足，翁氏不擬在滬久留，滬公司日常事務，將由協理負責處理，金開英協理亦准日內飛台省等油礦地區，再作詳盡考察云。</p>

<h3>紡建招待新聞界　報告最近業務槪况　上海部份各廠每日產量　棉紗一千件布二萬邸永君匹</h3>
<p>中國紡織建設公司，昨日下午特招待本市新聞界，由業務處副處長張似旅及蔣迪先等報吿，據云：「紡建公司最近上海部份各紡織廠開工情形漸趨順利，棉花到埠加增，紡織機器零件之缺乏問題逐步解決，熟練工人次第來歸、故開工狀况獲致好轉，開工紗錠布機按計劃逐步增加，日夜運轉，每日的可生產綿紗一千件，棉布二萬餘疋，棉紗除一部份供廠自用外，其餘所產紗布，均大量出售，以補充戰後國內紗布之不足。　據五月中旬報吿靑島開工紡錠，已增加至一七三·四〇八枚，布機四·二一七台，天津開工紡錠至一七七·〇五八枚，布機五·〇九七台，尙在積極增開中，生產數靑島各廠每日約產棉紗一五〇件，布三千餘疋，天津各廠產紗一四八件，布四千餘疋，上述兩地紡織工廠以電力不足，零件缺乏，故只開日工。</p>
<p>業務方面因國內棉貨尙感缺乏，棉紗布出口政府列入禁令之中，暫以調劑國內需要，穩定市價爲主，出售製品，均係現貨，並不拋售期貨，用防囤積投機情事，以本年一月初之市價爲基數一〇〇，至五月份主要物價變動，米爲七八五，油爲三〇八，煤爲二三八，烚赤爲二一五，而二十支紗僅爲一四八，十二磅細布爲一四〇，紗布終呈平穩之象。</p>
<p>又據該公司業務處負責人表示爲兼顧各地紗布需要及平價起見，更積極運貨至渝粤津油杭等地平售，美墨近以到貨數量甚多，亟須整理，致最近一，二期不克應銷，一俟內部整理就緒即可照常平售云。</p>
<h3>繭貸一百五十億　浙繭汛以嘉興為較佳</h3>
<p>蘇浙皖三省卅五年春繭貸款銀團，於上月七號成立，貸款總額二百億，其辦法由銀團管理款項，調撥收付，中蠶公司監管貸款用途分配，聞業經該公司審査合格絲業公司，共有五十三家，內包括絲廠八十九所繭行五百廿八家，至昨日截止，核管撥付貸款已逾一百五十二億，至其貸款標準，係按各公司所屬絲廠之絲車數額，及其生產效能，動力及烘煮檢騐等設備情形每台絲車以收購乾繭三擔至十二擔爲標準，據中蠶公司統計，一一百億元貸款已敷應用。</p>
<p>又浙省育蠶因土種較多，故繭汎亦早，如無錫等處，皆係改良極，因之略遲，近日始忙於收購，而江浙兩省本年春繭收成，以浙江之嘉興爲最佳。</p>

<h3>粵共黨武裝人員北撤序幕　本報廿五日廣州航訊　特派員梁風</h3>
<p>久懸未決問題　告一段落</p>
<p>關於中共在粵東江武裝人員這個問題，從去年便開始爭議。中共說他們有若干若干的部隊在這裏，但是行營方面則說這裏並沒有中共部隊，有的祗是土匪，因為如果是軍隊，應該有番號，有明顯的旗幟。既沒有番號，而又有武裝，這當然是土匪了。這樣各執一詞，從去年攪到今年，這問題還是懸而未決。</p>
<p>今年一月廿五日，北平軍調部第八小組來此，這小組有美方代表米勒上校，中共代表方方上將，和政府代表貢維勒少校。但他們到了之後，因為這裏是否有共軍這個問題，未有證實前，實無從開始執行他們的調處工作，所以這問題甚至張發奎將軍和周恩來先生在南京作過私人談話之後，仍然沒有結果。後來，到三人　組軍事代表團代表查民上校，政府代表皮宗敢上校，中共代表　承志等來粵，與第八小組和行營授權代表敷度會商後，行營遵寗，蔣主席指示下列三原則之下，協助實施。</p>
<p>（一）登船地點大鵬灣。</p>
<p>（二）人數二千餘人，（不得超過三千人）。</p>
<p>（三）時間至開始調查之日起，至登船之日止，以一個月為限，不得超出。</p>
<p>行營代表在這三原則之下，又與代表團協商了十項決議，其中包括東江以南以北及粵北三地區之中共武裝人員二千四百人，在大鵬半島築中，用美國輪船運到山東烟台登岸，以及關於中共武裝人員撤退的具體細則。於是，這個久懸未決的問題，才算是告一段落。</p>
<h3>中共武裝人員　開始北撤</h3>
<p>這些決議，在四月四日便公佈，但是到了五月中旬，這些所謂並非土匪的中共武裝人員不但遲遲不去，而且在這期間，當東江北江等地駐軍移防之際，他們大肆擾亂，四處搜劫，綁架勒索，殺害人民，和勒收路錢等事件，層出不窮。這不禁使廣東的民衆又擔憂起來，大家都在疑惑：他們究竟是不是要走的？究竟幾時才走得了？</p>
<p>終於，消息在五月廿三日傳出，中共武裝人員已定期北撤了，而且定於本月廿五日是協定中一個月的第一天開始時間，那末，如果不曾又生什麽枝節問題的話，按照協定的一個月，便可在六月　　廿四日以前，完全北撤完竣。</p>
<h3>四個執行支組　撤退程序</h3>
<p>關於他們的集中撤退，第八小組早已有了一個縝密的計劃，這計劃是按照協定而協助實施的。並派出東江以南，東江以北，粵北三個地區的甲乙丙丁四個執行支組，這四個支組分發的路綫及撤退程序是這樣：甲乙組，由三多祝起至平山，第三日集中淡水。丙組，由橫河至龍溪，晉龍，第三天抵達淡水集中。最長路綫的是丁組，由粵北的扶溪起，第一天到週田，此後挨次按日經大塘，龍口，沙田，樟坑，白芒，迴龍，鴨仔鋪，而達淡水。共計九天，達到淡水後即集中移到大鵬灣準備登船。等船期間，他們分駐在黃魚涌，心田，坪山圩，橫崗圩和沙頭角一帶，利用逗留時間，由美方醫藥人員檢查體格，并施行防疫注射和種痘，以防止傳染病的發生。關於輜軍的運輸和人員落船的程序，由第八小組和中共代表澈底商談，確定了日期之後，就通知美國船只準備，把這二千四百各的中共武裝人員送到烟台去。現在美軍第一組，包括軍運，通訊，及醫藥人員，共十四人，由德令上校率領，業已由上海抵九龍，即將開往大鵬灣協助第八小組工作。</p>
<h3>製定證章標誌　沿途保護</h3>
<p>爲了各執行小組和工共人員在集中時的便利和安全，他們製就了一些證章標誌。執行小組人員是心臟形的臂章，上爲藍色，有白色，「軍調」二字，下是紅色，有三個白色的圓環，並有長方形的紅邊胸章。中共人員，則有方形的小旗，左上三角形爲紅色，右下三角形爲白色，下面橫書，「廣東中共武裝人員某組某隊」，隊伍前後各舉此旗，以資識別。另每人發給藍邊的胸章，上面是「廣東中共武裝人員軍」等字樣，下面是姓名，年齡和號碼。這種證由第八小組蓋章發給，另外還有一種「中共廣東武裝人員復原證」，這種證印着這樣的文字：「根據三人會議代表團之調處，本隊武裝人員除二千四百名由美艦運至山東集中外，餘概進行復原，並經委員長廣州行營代表王衡少將予以決定不歧視之保證。茲有×××同志，是本部×××經核准復原，回×省×縣，望沿途軍營予以保護，該員籍貫地方政府給予安居就業。右給×××存執。</p>
<p>廣東中共武裝人員代表會生（蓋章）</p>
<p>林平（蓋章）」、</p>
<h3>北撤所需費用　全部解決</h3>
<p>其次，關於中共人員北撤所需費用，亦已由行營借給中共方面國幣三億七千三百六十八萬六千元，其中一億元已交給中共代表，其餘則由行營代爲購糧，待將所購糧款後付給。這樣對於中共武裝人員北撤的主要困難，大致已算完全解決了。</p>
<p>在廿三日的第八小組招待記者席上，中共代表方方說：「這次廣東中共武裝人員北撤，是爲貫徹「長江以南撤退武裝人員」的諾言，而且和平是全國人民的要求，中共此舉足以告慰於廣東父老……」</p>
<p>在這裏，也許有人會問：爲什麽最初這裏說沒有共軍呢？這可以在中共代表方方和會生廿二日歡宴第八小組美軍代表，行營及政府代表的席上，行營代表王衡少將的致詞，可以得到答覆的。他說：「過去中共武裝沒有番號，亦無顯明旗幟，部隊與土匪實無辨別，且治安問題為重，故有綏靖工作之進行，並非指中共人員爲土匪。後來，北平軍調部來電說明，張主任對軍調部之意見均極尊重，乃成立北調協議……」。</p>
<h3>行營編成專稿　記錄暴行</h3>
<p>總之，中共武裝人員北撤，實在是廣東民衆所希望的。過去不管他是共軍也好土匪也好，但他們蹂躪地方搶劫屠殺的事實，實在不勝枚舉。我們從行營發表昨日致第八小組行字第廿三號備忘錄，便可以看見。它的內容中有這樣說：「現行營迭據北江方面人民之控訴，月來北江散匪紛向贛邊　擾，兩度洗劫長江墟，且於四月十九日將長江鄉副鄉長鄧俊棠及商民周振民，劉禹潮等三名擄去，幷將其財產搜劫無遣，從證件中發現此等行為，純係中共方面武裝人員所爲，中共此等不人道之屠害人民生命財產，應請貴組責成中共方面負責賠償。……」又說：「歷月來中共武裝人員利用北運未開始實施時期，到處勾結土匪，四出搶劫屠殺事件，不勝枚舉，茲謹將其犖犖大者，編成中共暴行記錄乙份附送查照，敬希列入調查資料之一……」這份中共暴行記錄雖然沒有發表，但書明是暴行記錄，我們自然可以顧名思義的了。</p>
<h3>東方威尼斯　梁溪情調</h3>
<p>— 無錫廿日通訊　高武弘</p>
<p>無錫，這京滬綫上的重鎮，山明水秀的魚米之鄉，工商繁榮，風景優美，人口有一百多萬，人們把它稱作「小上海」。這個江南的水鄉，也有人把它和蘇州並稱爲「東方威尼斯」，但許多到過無錫的人都說：無錫比蘇州更富有「威尼斯」情調。無錫，一名梁溪，又稱蓉湖。還有一個名字是西神，因為錫山原名西神山。相傳錫山原本產錫，後來錫礦開罄，故稱無錫，民國　基，金匱縣亦倂入無錫域內。</p>
<h3>依山環水　面臨太湖</h3>
<p>淪陷時，無錫受砲火的洗禮，幾乎精華全毀，滿地廢墟，一片荒涼。大家總認為經過這一次浩劫，不容易恢復舊觀了，但是無錫人有着令人難以置信的建設力，不上幾時，熱鬧地帶被燬的房屋，便洛續地重建起來。到敵寇降伏時，已完全恢復成為一個富麗堂皇的都市，而且由於人口激增，和政·軍·工·商各方面的重要性，有比過去更繁榮，更熱鬧的趨勢。</p>
<p>在戰前，無錫即有拆除城牆，建築環城馬路的計劃。按照目前的人口，和工商的發達，無錫在將來也許有改設為市的可能性。唯其如此，此刻正在計劃將來各重要街道拓寬至八公尺，以附合設市的條件。其次是將城牆拆除，建築環城馬路，此外是修理爲國軍撤退時破壞的七十二環洞的實帶橋，和建設模範新村。關於這些，縣政府建設科已擬就詳細計劃書，不日即可付諸實施。等這個建設新無錫的計劃實現後，我們可以坐着汽車，飽嘗無錫的全貌，暢遊無錫的名勝區了。</p>
<p>「領略六朝烟水味，莫愁湖畔結茅局。」記者認為如果你要：「領略無錫風景味」，那麼就得「環湖一遊名勝區」了。無錫的名勝，在山的方面，有賽泉山，那裏的二泉亭，是盡人皆知的。至於沿湖的，有蠡園·漁莊·東大池·梅園·小箕山·龜頭渚·這些地方，都是遊客們的目標。依山環水，面臨太湖，別有一番雄壯風光，和西湖一比較，一個是婉藝的少女，一個就是峻拔的英雄。當然，無錫的風景，不免缺少曲綫美。</p>
<p>這些地方。經過兵災以後。建築物全被拆光，尤其是梅閣，只剩了一個支離破碎的輪廓。門窗戶　，蕩焉無存，懷古傷今，都不免寄以無限感喟。</p>
<p>遊客最高貴的享受，是雇一艘汽艇，再加一隻油漆光亮，艙位寬敞的拖船，載着你到各處去遊覽。舟子還可以為你辦一席豐盛的無錫船菜。但這一筆支出，倒不是一般的人所負擔得起的。</p>
<h3>烟民上山　集團戒烟</h3>
<p>在雷厲風行肅清烟毒的今日，無錫也和各地採取同一步驟，事先沒有自新登記，在嚴密的搜查下，抓到的烟民共有四百五十一人，這批烟民，都被集中到中獨山的萬安禪寺去勒戒，再給他們以一個自新的機會。</p>
<p>中獨山是太湖中的一個小島，萬安禪寺便在這個島的山頂，地點是十分的荒涼，平時人跡罕至，揀中在這個地方，也好讓他們好好的懺悔一下。四百多個烟民中，女性佔了十分之一。年齡自七十二歲至十八歲，十八歲的，是一個女性。其中還有一名和尚，九流三教，色色俱全。</p>
<p>山上戒備森嚴，其五十步有一個哨兵，烟民休想越雷池一步，還成立了一個督查室，管理這些烟民。烟民們生活很苦，飲食粗　，他們頗有「早知今日、悔不當初」之感。希望他們能在苦難中　練起來，重新做一個人！</p>
<h3>文教事業　漸趨活躍</h3>
<p>省錫師，江蘇教育學院，和無錫國學專修學校，業已復校。私錫中校舍被燬，無法恢復。其餘除輔仁中學，也已遷回無錫，漸漸恢復到戰前的狀態。</p>
<p>國立復旦大學和邊疆學校，都決定遷到無錫來，復旦的校舍在大雷嘴，邊疆學校則已擇定梅園中的太湖飯店和宗敬別　爲校舍，一俟建築竣工，即將遷錫上課。在優美的環境裏，無錫這個穿上了新裝的古城，將更進一步，在教育上佔着重要的地位。</p>
<p>戰前，無錫的新聞事業，原佔着地方報紙的首位，淪陷時報紙在敵偽控制之下，只有一家「御用」的「無錫日報，滿紙荒唐，自無成績可言。戰後新聞事業乘機崛起，沉寂八年的報壇，登時熱鬧起來。現有日報四張：錫報，江蘇民報無錫版人報和大錫報。除大錫報外，其餘三家，都自備印刷。大家除在營業方面競爭外，編排和內容都很少改進。</p>
<p>比較可取的是錫報，編排新，消息快，更有各地特派記者的通訊稿，社論方面，似乎不太着重。副刊偏於海派作風，在生意眼上講，是迎合讀者的心理，嚴格的說，則有些流於低級。</p>
<p>無錫是一個大米市場，也是一個米糧的產銷總匯，附近各產米區的米稻，都集中到無錫來後，再運銷到各埠去。所以無錫米糧存底的　和價格的漲落，是足以影響到整個米市的。</p>
<p>這次米價的狂漲，記者冷眼旁觀，主要的原因，是上海糧管局發出了鉅額的糧貸金，大米蟲們拿到了這筆款子，就向各產銷地去採辦，當地的存米漸漸被他們搜空，形成來過於供的現象。一個月之內，無錫的米價由二萬七千元跳出了六萬元大關，罪魁禍首，首先要問到那些拿到糧貸金的米商！</p>
<p>這次米價的暴漲，似乎是米蟲門有計劃的行動。禁止出口和強制抑平，都不是治本之法，只有給奸商們造成更好的機會。現在只要問問他們：是不是要使飽經戰禍的同胞們，在看到勝利後的今日，活活地餓死？（五月二十日）</p>

<h3>爲蘇北同胞呼籲！</h3>
<p>主筆先生：為人類正義，爲世界文明，更爲了我們苦命的蘇北人，敬向政府呼籲，向社會公正人士呼籲，希望政府注意，希望社會人士救援，挽回蘇北的厄運，趕快救救我們淪陷在「解放區」的老百姓！</p>
<p>自從新四軍到了蘇北以後，人民可說沒有一天度過安適的日子，無論窮富的脂膏，全被榨盡。最傷心的，他們高喚着的「打鬼子」的口號，結果一槍不發，反而把蘇北的大小城鎮，完全送給敵人，使我們冤枉地挨着幾年的亡國奴的生活。而他們呢，幹的是敵後運動，藉着抗敵的幌子，引誘青年，利用地痞，不擇手段的欺騙，搜刮和破壞，試圖他們一天一天的擴充武力，伸張地盤，也就不顧老百姓的死活。</p>
<p>日本投降後，他們的抗戰假招牌失去了作用，同時減租罷租罷工的刺激，也不再使農民發生興趣，於是又演出了一幕極野蠻的慘劇，所謂「四十五日大鬥爭，三個月內不民主」！就是地主殺，中農殺，富農殺，老闆殺，士紳殺，知識份子殺，地方自治人員殺，在鄉軍政黨員殺，不偏不倚的老百姓也殺，殺得一個不留，並且累及被害者的眷屬和親友，在他們呌做拔膿根的工作。</p>
<p>幾月來，蘇北的老百姓，送命的送命，逃去的逃去，充家的充家，走不了的等着死神的光臨，像熱鍋上的螞蟻，過着煎熬的生活。他們天天策動一般地痞流氓，找着你坦白，找着你鬥爭，逼你無中生有的「債」，逼你盡招莫須有的罪名（國特，望中央，坐探，和什麽曲綫，安樂，經濟，理想，流動等等漢奸），然後叫你先受活刑，後受死刑，再　加上充公財產刑。他們的成績確不錯，下面就是他們最近殘酷的表現和潛密佈置的概要：（一）殺人：他們的殺人沒有事實的根據，沒有法律的準則，由縣政府分派政府到各區來推進，所謂肅奸工作，獎勵地痞流氓，檢舉良民，策動民兵開會公決，表面開人民公審大會，實則早經暗中決定，把被害者先打得半死，然後用插刀亂戳，不許家屬收殮，暴露屍體在田野間喂狗。我們蘇北犧牲在這種殘酷暴刑下的人民，不可勝數，如東台縣屬的劉守銘，劉勉哉，謬可均，謬練百，周佑民，蔡順言，蔡君杰等，他們或稍具知識，或稍有田產，或稍烹資望，因為不受利用不受欺騙，遭其猜忌，莫名其妙的送了性命。</p>
<p>（二）人民牢：這也是策動民兵示意公決的一種刑罰，對被害者，處以一定的刑期，在頸項上掛着囚犯的木牌，腳上釘鐐，自己供給囚糧，坐在家中吃官司，如出門一步任何人都可以打死你。受這種罪的人太多了，如　的黃希陶，雙甸錢步青·吳樹海·吳善之·　茶蔡仲衡·謬秀生·徐禮南·謬乘誠·康漢臣·謬錫軒，都暫時在這種刑罰下換命。</p>
<p>（三）剌宇：這是一種變相的人民牢，盛行於如阜縣屬岔河·馬塘·　　一帶。所謂明奸（參加偽組織的），嗜奸（並未參加偽組織，而被他們策動民兵，　示流氓，硬說你是理想漢奸，曲綫漢奸的），望蔣派，國特（頃向中央或有國民黨籍的），如果逃了死刑，就逃不了墨刑，在你額角上刺起漢奸的字樣，劃一定的區域，准許你行動，如果出了圈子也就殺無赦。</p>
<p>（四）遊街游莊：這是一種最普通的刑罰，在解放區的市鎮上，天天敲鑼打鼓，鬧著遊街。凡穿長衫和穿旗袍的男女，都難倖免。如雙甸任孝庵，如是的劉澤仁，岔河的李政，海安的韓二小姐等，都被流氓檢舉了，戴着蒲包高帽，穿着紅布掛褲遊街。</p>
<p>（五）充公和罰糧：有許多人既然被處了死刑，判了徒刑，還不能了事，再加上田產沒收，房屋拆毀，呌你人死財空，一了百清。對於粗堪溫飽的人，他們政府鼓勵地痞流氓同你算帳，一而再，再而三，算不完這毫無根據的帳，每次算帳，就是每次的罰糧，一百担五百担信口開河，拿不出，田產給他拍賣，房屋給他拆去，再不夠，賣兒賣女也要同他結清。如李堡的劉粥成·任濟餘·謝于安·季雨成，　茶的謬玉農·謬伯明，掘港的陳仲華等，都遭受到這種破產的損失。</p>
<p>（六）磕頭：判處這種刑罰的人，罰了沿門磕頭，這是一種淩遲刑，不到一天包你頭破血流，慢慢萎廢地死去。如豐利的張強九·吳某·馬塘的郭裕昆·陳再唐等，都在磕頭刑下送了性命。</p>
<p>（七）特別組織：（一）聞香隊，專查那家吃得好，一有發覺，就登門鬥爭識別。（二）聽壁隊，是比周厲正的監謗還要利害的組織，他們白天在街頭巷尾，夜裏躲在人家門口屋角上，窮聽家庭私語，如有怨恨他暴行的私語，第三天包你送命。</p>
<p>（八）其他：（甲）他們花樣甚多，數不勝數，還有望中央的刑罰，把人高吊在樹上問你是否望到中央，然後繩子一解，跌成肉漿。（乙）如阜有位姓張的，在茶館裏不過說了一句：「多吃飯，少說話」的問話，就罰他吃飯二十碗，結果胃腸撐破，立刻身死。（丙）正月燈期出了一個燈謎「日本投降」，打一古人名，當時有人猜是「屈原」，他們不大滿意，硬說是「蘇武」，諸位你想這是什麽緣故？（丁）被他們認為的罪人，都名登紙榜，張貼通　，已經判定和執行的死囚寫上白榜，其已經處罰暫時開釋的，寫在錄榜，未判刑的，放在黃榜上。但是未判的和未死的，且慢歡喜，因為很有機會，給你黃榜升到錄榜，綠榜升到白榜。（戊）起初是燭惑工農，發動鬥爭，所劃糧食，資方無力繳納，即將田產拍賣佃農，田價以充罰糧，並日買戶每畝　稅契費稻子貳百斤，這樣他們即得到無數的食糧，陸續用海船運走，造成蘇北饑饉。</p>
<p>我們最初死迷着心，希望政治協商會議成功，中國和平地走入民主，但是事實告訴我們，共黨對於協商二字，全無誠意，不過利用協商的名義拖延時間，擴張地盤，等待機會以滿足他們赤化全國的野心。所以他們最近把黨外人殺的殺，逐的逐，焚書坑儒，效法始皇，儘量的脅迫青壯，充實武力，搜刮物資，進攻國軍，毀減建制，高喚着解放五洲（通州，揚州，泰州，徐州，鄭州）的口號。所以，政府多寬大一天，即共黨多伸張一日，也就是人民多遭蹂躪一天！諸位如不相信，請到「解放區」內嘗嘗他們「民主」的滋味！</p>
<p>他們最近的解放區內所潛密的基層組織和佈置，是一種最嚴密極險毒的組織。（下面是他們一個鄉鎮裏的機構。）</p>
<p>（一）鄉（鎮）政府：由指導員指揮監督着鄉（鎮）長副領導下面的五個機構：（甲）糧復微收：由主任領導着出納，調查，管理，會計等員掌管全鄉（鎮）糧賦物資的搜刮。（乙）村，組：依全鄉地形，區域劃分若干村，若干組，統制着若干戶，若干壯丁，而推行他們的一切行政。（丙）學校：除施行兒童　變教育外，每日有幾小時的成人教育，用意在採用育從及改換思想目的（丁）徵兵參軍國：由團長領導優抗，宣慰兩個組，不擇手段的吸引青壯，拉攏盲從，以達目的的爲原則。（戊）人事研究：自主秘密領導着研究，偵察兩個組，不擇手段的偵察，研究，三資份子，及在野的軍，政，黨，員的言論信仰有無敵對動態，如何可以利用，如何加以打擊，剷除的種種陰謀。</p>
<p>（二）民兵大隊：由指導員監督着大隊長（副）指揮領導下面的三個機構：（甲）民兵中分隊：編組以每村一分隊，三四村一中隊爲原則，活動時期，能集合若干大隊，隨時編成國營，發配武器，如步槍溜彈刺刀等，做他主力部隊的外圍警戒，或進攻時的先鋒部隊。（乙）基幹隊，（前稱模範隊）：從民兵中提選強悍份子組織而成，均經常配帶武器，長短槍枝，溜彈刺刀，有時也附配輕機槍擲彈筒等武器，在該區域內遊動。軍容青壯強悍，時化裝，時武裝，陣容時整時零，甚至潛伏不動，不易察覺。他的活動，時若狂風暴雨，時若晨星寥寥。（丙）特務隊：從甚幹隊內提選優秀份子，嚴密組成，由隊長領導着破壞，聯絡，嗜殺（又名除奸），敵工等，四個組秘密施行一切工作。</p>
<p>（三）民運：由指導員督導鄉鎮長（兼支部主任），及青，工，農，商，學，婦，漁，鑒八大聯會（前稱抗會）主任領導着理事，組長，叫唆暗示，策動盲從，引起糾紛，造成殘殺，無非是搗亂社會，乘張人情，等等花樣，枚舉不盡。在兩個鄉至三個鄉的上面，區級的下面，還有區分黨部，各部門的黨委，保安組織（暗殺領導機關），交通分站，工商局工商管理局（專門搜刮捐稅統制物資），敵工支團，等等領導機關和秘密組織。</p>
<p>目前所急迫的就是夏敢問題。他們從四方八處的微調　部隊，分佈在鄉村裏活動，所謂保衛「夏收」。同時他們基層人員的工作，也非常的緊張，準備着徵糧，徽章，獻糧，罰糧，徵兵等等的搜刮和擴軍工作。苦命的蘇北人，挨餓的時期，那一天才能終了呢！</p>
<p>死者已矣，我們從死神手裏逃出的難民，數千萬的在飢餓綫上苟活的人，將如何生存下去，還是回去送給共黨宰割，還是在外等待餓死？政府除了援救我們而外，要曉得蘇北就是京　，近在咫尺，變成割據局面是如何危險！所以蘇北問題，絕不是次要問題，也決不能再妥洽牽延下去！江蘇省秦縣東台縣流亡難民代表呂國鈞，劉藝國，謬似程，謬宜金，周仁甫，周再新，三十五年五月二十二日。</p>
<h3>「蜀錦」在貧病中</h3>
<p>— 成都廿二日航訊　周泱泉</p>
<p>在衣着方面，人們都貫以「杭綢蘇繡（洲繡並稱），京緞和蜀錦」並稱。譽爲我國四大名產，不僅在國內享着盛名，就是國際上也是視為珍品。現在前三者，我們暫且不論，我們現將蜀錦的近況作一個簡要的介紹：</p>
<p>蜀錦，一提到這名字，凡是賞鑒過她的人就會讚美它的藝術性，尤其是省外人士，更是聞名而嚮往。盟國的友人們，在過去來到成都的時候，最能吸引他們的，也是這美麗的蜀錦。蜀錦，他為四川而開着多年的榮譽的花朵，人們想着了她，就會想念到四川。</p>
<h3>手工業結晶　由血汗煎煉而成</h3>
<p>蜀錦可說是手工業的結晶品，它是血汗煮煉出來的，它沒有一點機器，全憑着手，千萬人的手在創造它。在成都平原上，就是它誕生的集中地，以成都市區來說，以識蜀錦爲業的。據調查所知，在抗戰前超出一千家以上，現在因工商業的凋敝，已減少到七百餘家了。每家的識機最多的有七八架，而一家兩架或三架的就佔半數以上，平均每家約為三架，以七百家計算，共約二千餘架機子。這些機子，全是木質的，機身長一丈二尺最為普遍，和織布木機稱造頗多相仿，只是經綫的層數，多至八層吧了，因為如此，所以在成品上才能發生絲光，至於梭子也略長，兩端有長約五寸的鐵尖，工人們用手　送，一下一下地來來去去。機身上端牽絲處，高踞在房屋的半空，下端編織處。深陷在挖空的地平綫下，所以機子都安裝在泥地上，掘下一個深約三尺餘的坑裏。</p>
<h3>一送一回間　織成美麗的圖案</h3>
<p>每家機都是要兩個工人，一個稱為「上手」，他是負責任在上端牽絲提花的，間來整理經綫，一個稱為「下手」，他是實際負編織責任的。他坐在機上，大半身子都落坑中。「下手」的手藝是要比「上手」高強些，在他的腦海中刻劃了千百種圖案，就在他手一送一回之間，可以織成若干種動物，禽獸，花卉和各種各式美麗的圖案來，沒有模型，沒有範本，全憑着記憶，任你一個善繪畫的，也要歎為觀止了。</p>
<p>無錫風景　（上）龍頭渚的一角　（下）梅園中的念劬塔</p>
<h3>四千餘工人　生活得暗澹無光</h3>
<p>二千多架機子，四千多個工人，他們生活在暗澹無光，空氣不通的古式房子裏，說來也很奇怪，蜀錦的成品都張展在最繁榮的市中心區，而那製造的地方却都迭在陋巷僻街里，那美麗漂亮的蜀錦，誰想不到就出生在那塵埃污穢的地方喲！他們大都是受雇的工人，他們除去自主人供給食住的待遇外，工資是按工計酬的，下手每尺可得百餘人，上手每尺得酬僅七八十元，一丈長的被面，兩大的時間準可以交貨了。他們從早到晚的工作着，機子響着輕微的擊撞聲，他們的生活，枯寂，呆板，在他們每個人的額頭上，都深深地刻着愁苦的綯紋，面如榮色。更爲着提花和分絲等的強求記憶，上了年紀的人，多半光禿了頭，沒有休息，沒有娛樂，他們像牛一樣勞苦的工作着，從早到晚，從春到秋度着一年一年艱辛的歲月，在房子的壁間，有他們嚼爛的紅絲綫團，那塊塊的絲團，會使人們誤認為可怖的血塊，這多多少少給敏感的人一些恐怖的感覺。</p>
<p>估計全城區每天可出貨二千數百丈的成品，因為資金的短缺，他們很少有囤貨，大半是應商家的訂貨或預貨，因此有時承認了預貨，受到絲價的高漲，不但要忍痛的為人編織，而且還要忍痛折本。據說今年在銷路上受到挫折，商家多不願意大量購買，加之，今年因為春旱關係，　絲受到很大的影響，買進的成本加高，貨品更不易銷售，他們更瀕於破產的狀態了。一位坐在機上的下手和記者談起，他們在少年時要跟着師傅學習四年，因為提花，分絲等煩難，他到如今已做了十四年，他猶認為還沒有「學到家」，他若有無限的感喟，說：「我們這門行當，已不堪再做下去了。」看多少張嘴，多少隻手，在這工商業破產中，一天比一天更痙攣了，記者帶着顆沉重的心，匆匆地離開那暗淡無光的機房。</p>
<h3>廬山新面目　籌設夏令學術講習會</h3>
<p>— 南昌廿五日通訊　鄧貴華</p>
<p>廬山風景清幽，爲國內有名避暑聖地。贛省府以暑期即屆，中外人士均將來山游憩，同時，蔣主席亦有駐節牯嶺辦公消夏之訊，故對於復原各項建設，均在着着進行。</p>
<p>由九江至蓮花洞公路長十三公里，翻修經費已呈由中央公路總局撥給。爲爭取時間計，先由公路處在中央撥到各工程款項下墊付二千萬元。潯牯電信路綫，現經交通部電訊總局積極整修，一二週即可通報通話。以牯嶺爲中心至各名勝風景區之道路，則早由日俘修築竣事，山中風景區及各種建築物，亦均在大事整理。蔣主席目邸，亦修葺一新。聞本省爲提倡學術起見，將在廬山開辦夏令講習會，內分教育·體育·英文·數理·化學·博物·文史·地理·藝術八組，時間暫定一個月。自七月十五日起至八月十五日止。屆時，名流學者，冠蓋雲集，名山必更生色。贛省府以九江爲江西門戶，抗戰八年，遭敵破壞，殘缺不堪，刻已令行縣府將大中等三幹綫，加以整理刷新，以便迎接即將蒞臨之中外避暑人士。</p>
<h3>人類的廢物利用　蓉市煙民濬河道</h3>
<p>— 成都廿六日航訊　周泱泉</p>
<p>市政府利用烟民淘掘金河御河，業經數月，現已全部竣事。</p>
<p>最近巫山下二峯中之神龍架，發現一片原始林，巍然葱　，高聳雲際，具備三種樹木。據調查者云：該地所產木材，如經砍伐後，可供給全國鐵路五十年之用。現有關當局將合租一公司，實行大規模開發。</p>
<p>國府遷都前，蔣主席蒞蓉之訓詞，省府決定印爲軍行本，分發各機關團體學校存覽，張兼主席岳軍，對於此項訓詞作有「敬　」一文，附載其後，俾讀者更深一層了解。現單行本正在趕印中。</p>
<p>蓉市定外南華西增爲實騐示範保，此次甲長選舉，大學校長，教授等均參加，華大校長張凌高等當選為中長。至保民市府辦理公職檢閱登記者至爲踴躍，其中省府主席張翠，大學教授陳筑山等，均將爲該保保長之候選人。</p>
<p>市政府正擬籌建一民衆社交大會堂，同時在中正公閱（即少城公閱改名）內，開設一民衆戲院，一切詳細辦法正籌商中。</p>
<p>市政府積極改進本市交通，決定翻修路面，一律規定街心四公尺用水泥，兩旁用碎煤屑，根據破爛情形及交通需要，擇其緩急，先後修補。材料方面，在徵收之工程受益費內開支，工人由國民義務勞動微調。</p>
<p>川省改建模範省，各部五年計劃，省府現正加緊討論，現已討論竣事者，計有：教育，建設，地政，衛生，會計，禁烟，保安，社會，等八部門，其他如：民政，財政等，亦將脫稿。</p>
<p>蓉市供電，最初十日停一次，後三日一停，編則隔日一停，終則日日停，隨時停。但最近啓明電氣廠修理椒子街及詠霓　兩廠，又宣佈恢復三天一停制，由此可知蓉市電氣專業之內容。</p>
<p>修築成渝鐵路，決定在本年七月動工，建設應何北衡　長最近在滬接洽材料中。</p>
<p>市府利用烟犯，淘掘金河御河，現已竣事，真可謂「利用廢物」。</p>
<p>月餘來爲成都市教育界多事之秋，先後發生槍殺及兇殺案三起：（一）成華大學四年級學生文子光被謝逢春連長殺死於送仙橋畔。（二）立達中學學生張國肱厲刀刺傷訓有主任祝佩聲。（三）黃浦中學學生龍士正刀殺死同學孫文中。三案均在地方法院偵訊中。</p>
<h3>沖繩島的兒童</h3>
<p>沖繩島的兒童在稻草蓋頂的校舍外遊戲，該島人民在美軍市民事務所監督下，管理自己的政府，勝利後，該島即着手從事建設工作，現已略具規模。</p>
<h3>軍民合作在諸暨　廿日諸暨通訊</h3>
<p>— 當岱</p>
<p>這裏駐有浙保二團和一八七師，後一部隊的官兵，和老百姓相處，幾乎沒有發生過一點小摩擦，譬如：平時借東西，態度必很客氣，借後用完就奉還，有損壞照價賠償，毫無怨容。又譬如上街購物，絕不面紅耳赤的爭價錢，買得起就買，買不起，默默走開，我曾親眼看到：有一次一個官佐在路上走，不幸被一個魯莽的挑柴人撞到了，而且擦破了皮膚，可是他却不作一聲，立刻爬起，撲撲泥水（那天下雨），若無其事的走開了。</p>
<p>一八七師的官兵很熱心公益事業，最近他們選出了四百位弟兄協助縣政府當局趕修火車站至城站的一段馬路，不受任何招待，自己　開火，自動勞作，並且自動決定：限一個月內趕修完成。近日城區商家自動籌了錢，一頭毛豬，一缸黃酒，準備慰勞他們。</p>

<h3>抗議公營劇院拍賣</h3>
<p>— 康泰</p>
<p>上海地方當局從敵人手裏接收下來的幾座電影院在公開徵求顧主，是決定拍賣了。據說拍賣的原因是「公營」不下去，（或曰不得法）收入不抵支出，虧損太大，便決定公開拍賣，以便收入幾個現錢，再辦其他公用事業。</p>
<p>我們不研究這樣說的原因是否眞實，更不願過問拍賣的動機，總之，將公營劇院拍賣，我們是堅決反對的。</p>
<p>任何先進國家，不但有國家劇院（首都所在地）同時各都市却有公營別院，這種劇院與一般商營的創設性質是有分別的，一般商營劇院爲了賺錢牟利，不惜千方百計，這是無可評議的，而國家劇院或公營劇院，除了同樣採用營業方式以便利用收人維持院務開支之外，同時注重如何竭力運用劇院成爲敎育大衆的公共塲所。換言之，這種劇院的營業只是手段，文化服務乃是最低限度的目的。</p>
<p>我國一向來因了物資限制，國家沒有劇院，公營劇院當然更無力創設，此次總算僥倖從敵人手中接收了幾座劇院，也美其名的呌做「公營戲院」了，想不到經營還不足幾個月，又要拍賣給商人了。地方當局道種措施是欠周詳考慮的。我們反對，至於這幾個月來所謂「公營劇院」幷未發生絲毫「公營」的效果，不在末文討論之列，容再後論，我們很希望與論界起來提醒這件事，請求賢明的地方當局愼重地考慮一下。再辦！</p>
<h3>中國「精神食糧」荒嚴重</h3>
<p>— 唐紹華</p>
<p>據世界糧食會議調査統計：整個世界都在鬧着嚴重的糧荒　而中國的糧荒尤最嚴重。可是在今日的上海，筆者以爲與糧荒同樣悄形的，精神食糧之貧乏亦非常的嚴重。從一般文化出版物而言，數量雖有若干，而够得上稱爲精神食糧的，實在太少——少得可憐！</p>
<p>筆者是與電影事業比校接近的，便以比較熟習的電影來舉例，上海是中國電影製片集中地，可是勝利以來只有中央電影攝影塲第二廠，費了九牛二虎之力才攝製了一部「忠義之家」。其他公司製片還只是消息而已，這種產量，未免太嫌少了。上海有映演電影的影院四十餘座，除了少數兩座四輪影院偶而放映兩部過了時的舊國產片之外，將近四十座影院全部經常地映演着外國影片（百分之九十五是美國片英片與蘇聯片輸入的數量亦不多），筆者決無排斥外國影片的心理，反之，在電影方面，中國太落後，我們應該歡迎優良的外片供應，可是問題乃是外人所供應我們的影片之內容是否優良？而够上稱爲「精神食糧」？</p>
<p>從勝利以來九個月上海方面進口的一千三百幾十部美國電影米看，百分之八十以上都是以色情或怪異爲號召的。這種浪漫荒唐內容的影片，最足以影響社會風氣與人情，我國一般平民均富有模倣學樣的習氣，尤其對於外來的惡劣作風，更容易樂於接受，這實在一個非常可怕而嚴重的問題。我們每天每月每年流出去極爲驚人數量的外匯，而換到的却是一些對於我國社會人民有百害而無一利的惡影響，這實在是不公道的。我們謹向美國電影製片家和發行商呼籲，希望在救濟世界糧荒的同時，也顧及到「精神食糧」的救濟，尤其是「精神食糧」荒最爲嚴重的中國。附帶我們要正吿替好萊塢經營在華發行影片的中國大班先生們，在「生意眼」的爭取的同時，更要摸着良心，爲自已同胞打算，我們已經流出去了如此驚人數量的金錢，希望能够換取一點可以敎育同胞的「精神食糧」！</p>

<h3>怎樣欣賞戲劇　黃佐臨先生在滬江大學講</h3>
<p>— 鮑忠記</p>
<p>我覺得現在的各種報輩雜誌上的戲劇批評，大多偏重於演員方面，而且對於演技並沒有加以分析，不過是混統地寫些觀後感想而已，不能算是眞正的戲劇批評，也不是眞正欣賞戲劇的態度。那末怎樣欣賞戲劇呢？可分三方面來講。</p>
<p>劇本方面二影響戲劇最重要的是劇本，如果劇本的內容很有意義，結構非常緊凑，台詞十分美麗的話，那末，在演出時，一定能够博得觀衆的讚美；反之，劇本的內容空虛，結構鬆懈，台詞粗俗的話，一定不能得到美滿的成績。可惜在最近的劇壇上，我們可以看出一個趨向，就是越有意義的劇本，賣座越是淸淡，而以噱頭爲號召的戲，却大有「欣賞」人在，可見得觀衆們水準的降低，也可說他們還沒有欣賞戲劇的能力。</p>
<p>演技方面：說起演技，它包括演員演戲的天才和他們的身體語普的運用程度，普通一個演員的有吾天才，可用五種方法去測定：就是他們的摹倣力，敏感力，應變力，想像力，和吸引力能够及得上標準嗎？尤其是幕倣力最爲重要，它雖然是每個人的本能，但却有程度上的差異，一個好的演員就會從地理氣候，社會宗敎，風俗習慣等種種束縛中解放出來，使他的表現眞正地達到「維妙維肖」的境界；至於敏感力也是每一個藝術家所應備的條件，尤其是充當一個演員，更需要有高度的戲劇的敏感；應變力就是一種舞台上的敏感，因爲演員在舞台上，要和其他的演員或佈景燈光等發生密切的關係，一定要能隨機應變才好，只顧自已唸合詞是最要不得的，我可以舉一個實例來證明，像某歷史很悠久的劇團，他們的主角時常在台當中做戲，一個人出風頭，使其他的演員只好背向觀衆演戲了，這樣缺乏應變能力的演員終究要被淘汰的；還有，一個演員雖有豐富的生活經騐，但是想像力仍舊是不可缺少的，譬如說，劇本中需要殺人的塲面，而他們在實際生活上根本沒有這種經騐，這時演員的想像力就感到極度需要，他們可以想到在拍死一隻騷擾不淸的蚊子時的性情（這是可能得到的生活經騐）。憑想像力擴大表現出來，在演出時就顯得逼眞了；最後要提到吸引力，可以分二種，像好萊塢的選拔人才往往就祇偏重於外表的吸引力（容貌體格等），今日上海戲劇界中往往也犯了這種毛病，其實，除了外表上的吸引力外，更需要人格，風度等內在的吸引力。至於演員身體的運用，就是指面部，軀幹，四肢各部肌肉的運用，常常有許多演員面部沒有表情，或者表情落入定型，就是因爲祇運用了部份的肌肉，還有要會靈感與肌肉配合的運用，我曾經見過印度的舞蹈家，在四肢上套了很多的銅圈，他們能够役使其中任運一個圈發出響聲，這種身體的何用可說是最臻優美了。當然，語音的運用也是「話」劇中的一個極大的因素，利用它可以輔助表情的不足。</p>
<p>演出方面：大多是導演的責任，導演在戲劇的演出上，不僅是排佈演員在舞台上的地位，最重要的是幫助演員的了解認識劇中人物的個性，但是並不是敎演員做每一個動作，獨裁專制式的導演，做演員的往往不能發揮他們自己的技能，那末反而影響整個戲劇的效果了。因爲，戲劇像一棵大樹，演員是樹上的葉子，導演不過負供給養料的責任罷了。我認爲導演硏究一個劇本，至少要閱讀三遍：第一遍是純粹的欣賞，第二遍才仔細分析，第三遍加以批評改良。排演的時候能在情調上加以注意，一待成熱，一個劇本就能搬上舞台演出了。</p>
<p>一個觀衆能注意上述各點，方是一個眞正的戲劇欣賞者。</p>
<p>戲劇欣賞：一，劇本：劇作者。二，導演。三演員演技：身體的運用，話音的運用，天才的測騐：模倣力，敏感力，應變力，想像力，吸引力，</p>
<h3>桃樂珊拉摩近作</h3>
<p>— 江新明</p>
<p>「紗龍女郞」挑樂珊拉摩，在上海的影迷的腦海中該是十分熟悉的。迷人的眼睫，逗愛的臉龐給影迷們留下了不可磨滅的印象。尤其在「暴風刧」，「水火島」，「美人魚」諸片中，她的游泳和舞蹈是的確令人欽仰。自勝利後在上海，她的片子已經映過者有「邊城壯士」，「海國嬋娟」，「星光四射」等。其演技以「邊城壯士」中最獲好評。在瑪莉蒙丹稱雄的今日影壇，而影迷們還是喜歡她的片子，可見拉摩的受人歡迎並不因此黯然失色。</p>
<p>今年派拉蒙公司有兩張她主演的片子發行特介紹於後：（一）鳥托邦之路：＂Road　to　U　Topia＂是一個天大鬧劇，除拉摩外，還有平克勞斯貝和飽勃霍伯。仍舊是在「南國之春」「游碼頭」「麻洛哥之路」中的老搭擋。在今日這三個大明星的名聲是並駕齊驅的。然而還是合作演出，其精神可嘉，而本片實是不可多得的鉅片。此片雖然是今年的出品，但在二年前已攝製完竣。全片充溢着滑稽的塲面和表情。更穿插着三巨星的歌唱，舞蹈。的確是一張上乘的喜劇片。</p>
<p>（二）墨西哥舞會＂Masqueradelin　Maxico＂拉摩和奧特羅考杜伐合演「邊城壯士」的男主角亦就是他。在此片中二人有新奇的舞姿，更配合着南美的音樂，極名貴。由名導演密夏萊孫（Mitciell　Leisen）導演。「海盜名流」＂Frenchman's　Creek＂就是他的傑作。</p>
<h3>回憶吳永剛拍「建國之路」</h3>
<p>— 管玉</p>
<p>中電二廠的「忠義之家」即將與本市觀衆見面，該片爲我們勝利歸來後的第一部國產片。記得該片編導吳永剛·曾於卅三年秋由重慶帶領大隊人馬經貴陽至黔貴路拍攝「建國之路」。演員有胡蝶·魏鶴齡·謝天·葉高·方伯等四十餘人。該片內容是描寫漢苗合作完成」條在軍事上非常重要的鐵路。沒想到：這一大隊人馬正達到目的地，剛開始工作。沒幾天就碰着軍事轉變廠人由湘而桂，沿黔桂路一直到貴定，幾乎到了貴陽。貴州省政府也貼出了通吿疏散居民。十一月底，貴陽市里的商店，大多數都不做生意，關門大吉！這大隊人馬急得一點辦法沒有，汽車找不到，鎭橋被炸斷，火車不通，於是，只有徒步逃命！從廣西一直走到貴陽，衣服行李完全丟光！背了「開麥拉」回重慶。起先，大家還想找車子，由導演吳永剛自吿奮勇找關係去設法，並負責打前站。大家又怕方伯這大胖子走不動，所以呌他陪吳永剛早一天出發，誰知越向後退越沒法弄到車子。因此，大家決心徒步走！他們一路上沒有飯吃，晚上沒地方睡覺。只睡在權底上，用繩子把被單吊在樹上遮露水。有幾天碰到大雨，把被都打濕。這是國曆十一月二十左右的時候，天氣又冷，白天走疲乏了，一到天晚找了樹底不就睡，野風一吹，地土又寒，所以很多人都生了病。這位編導得了痢疾，還加瘧疾，脚也走破了，只能設法用布包了脚再走，一步一痛，嘴里哼哼，有時餓得想喝一碗開水也沒有辦法，這樣，居然拖到了貴陽，大家第一條件是洗了一次澡，休息了兩天，吃了一點藥，方找到車子回重慶。當他和筆者見面時，第一句話就是：「我想不到還會和你見面。」這時，他的臉又黃又瘦，連走路的氣力都沒有。</p>
<p>現在我們勝利了，回到了上海，他的第一部勝利片，已快全部完成。這次拍攝「忠義之家」和他上次在黔桂　上拍攝「建國之路」的情形，眞有天地之別。因此，更覺得這次工作的完成，是一件不容易的事。</p>
<p>拍「建國之路」時的這種　，沒有親身嘗過的人，怎麽能知道他的味兒呢？</p>
<h3>好萊塢巨頭談　本年度影業趨向</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>柴納克（Darryl　Zanuck—二十世紀福斯）：『未來的影業發展必是趨向於全球性的。好萊塢準備在東西二半球遍設分公司以從事攝製發揚美國民主精神的各種影片。』</p>
<p>海爾華立斯（Hal　Wallis－派拉蒙）：『本年度影增最重要的工作是發掘新星；因爲普通一般紅星平均在一年內所拍的影片是極有限的；換句話說，如果你今天才而希望踏入好萊塢的話，有年就是一個最好的機會呢。』</p>
<p>約克華納（Jack　L．War—ner—華納）：『在這次戰爭中，非但在戰塲上發現了不少的新武器；而在銀幕上，亦步入了一個新紀元，無論從科學上，或藝術上觀，未來的發展是不可預言的。』</p>
<p>勃崙自（N．J．Blumberg—環球）：『好像現在有人希望未來的世界是「天下一家」，我們辦電影事業的亦希望將我們的工作走上同一的路上。』</p>
<p>亨利康恩（Harry　Cohn—哥倫比亞）：『十年內，電影事業在技術上的確是進步了不少。可是今日的電影除了技術上的問題外，更緊要的是我們所攝影片的題材及內容該抓住全世界的觀衆。』</p>

<h3>舞臺和文學</h3>
<p>— 李健吾</p>
<p>法國十七世紀</p>
<p>法國十七世紀是一個了不起的時代，古典文學在這時候算是拔了尖兒，單就戲院來說罷，高奈葉，辣辛，莫里哀，悲劇也好，喜劇也好，全成了後人模倣的煌輝的對象。尤其是莫里哀，在中國也差不多快和一位中國劇作家一樣有名了。</p>
<p>他們在文學史上的地位是那樣高，幾乎每齣戲都成功一部傑作，不過這是從文學價值的觀點來看，假如拋掉學院的天花亂墜的字面，單拿當時舞台上演的記錄做準，那可真就另是一個相反的局面了。說起來也好笑，幾乎難得一部傑作得到觀衆的擁戴。莫里哀有些傑作簡直就失敗了。我們在課室裏聽到先生們渲染的那些名作，隨便舉幾個例罷，就全只是演了四五次，掩旗息鼓，便無聲息了。</p>
<p>拿莫里哀來看，「慳吝人」那樣流行，中國還改編了好幾次，曹禺有一個「財狂」的本子，願仲彝有一個「黃金迷」的本子，可是在當時就完全坍臺了。英國麥芮狄斯推做高喜劇，喜劇的極峯之作的「恨世者」，中國老是有了譯本，在當時也替莫里哀丟了人。莫里哀還有兩齣傑作，也走着「慳吝人」的薄命，一個是「上流人」，一個是「女學者」。</p>
<p>我這裏不提辣辛，那位被詩人奉為圭臬的大悲劇作家，他有名的「菲墜」，故事是希臘的，可是人性是現代的，我們的「雷雨」便是這樣一個故事，繼母愛前妻之子，我是說他的「菲墜」也在當時沒有得到觀衆垂青。他還有好幾　傑作不曾為他爭面子。那位法蘭西悲劇之父的高奈葉並不比他的晚輩高明了多少，他有時候還在他手裏栽跟頭。真是慘透了。</p>
<p>那麼誰成功了呢？高奈葉有一位兄弟也偶而寫寫戲，有一回從一部通行的小說裏面提出一段故事改做悲劇，造成十七世紀舞臺的最高紀錄，足足演出了八十次，等於我們今日三四百次，還是演員演膩了，這才自動罷休。名子呌做「蒂冒克辣特」Timocrate。那個盛勁兒好像「秋海棠」可以比擬，也都是通俗小說改過來的貨色。</p>
<p>喜劇最高的記錄也不是莫里哀拿走的，他的傑作爲他爭到最低的記錄，永遠沒有為他弄到最高的記錄。那麼是誰在這方面成功了呢？又是一位不是經傳的人物，呌做布爾叟的。同他寫了一齣喜劇，題目漂亮極了，呌做「沒有題目的喜劇」，足足演了六十二次，後來還一演再演，一直演到被十八世紀驅逐出境為止。</p>
<p>當然莫里哀也有幾次成功，例如「自以為病的病人」，演了四十二次。又如「自以為烏龜的烏龜」，也趕到了四十次。但是，和那些勝利者一比，他老人家的招牌可真是砸了。</p>
<p>看完了這些事實，我們一定要起老大的感想。舞台價值和文學價值之間真就有什麽鴻溝嗎？觀衆和讀者之間也真就不相貫通嗎？還是時間作累，是非沒有一定的準則？這是一出好玩的問題，我不想多舌了，也許有人還以為我有意爲冷戲說法哩。</p>
<h3>雕刻家的成功</h3>
<p>— 張充仁</p>
<p>法大雕刻家羅丹說：「奔走活動的人們決不是傻的」，這是他指着當時和他競爭的許多雕刻家而說的，「如果你要和他們這些人競爭，你至少要浪費和他們相等的光陰」，「然而他們如果能把功夫多用在雕刻室裏，那他們一定會有更多的美的製作」羅丹參加過許多次偉大人造像的比賽，但是幾乎每次都落選的，他所作的詩人囂俄像和著作家巴爾札克像至今成為雕刻上不朽名作者，都是參加造像比賽中被一知半解的評判員選踢出去的，當時中選而堅立起來的造像，多半庸俗無奇，史冊不載，藝界不提，立在街頭路旁，有時由重要的地點搬移到次要的路口，過一時又從次要的路口移到冷　的牆邊園角，毀之可惜，留之無益，變成市容上的贅瘤，終於被人遺忘了，然而羅丹的製作先不用於人而擱置於畫室深處，終於被人挖掘出來爲萬世仰慕，是有其原因在。</p>
<p>余在柏林熱愛德大雕刻家雷特爾的作品，雷氏是當代德國最著名的雕塑家，強我使館爲我出信介紹，隨後得登門拜訪，門開處大小石膏像雜立成羣，我問大師何在，內中一尊像動起來了，是雷氏穿了純白工衣從像羣中走過來面貌和藹，意態隨便，握了我的手說：「東方藝人也喜歡我的作品麼」我們沒有說客套，直接就談入雕塑藝術上的種種話，他提出許多他對於雕塑藝術上的見解，很深刻，很獨特，對於塊和恒二點上的功夫是用得很深很深的，在柏林時我隔三五天要去訪他一次的，總是在他雕刻室裏，他一面捏黏土一面和我談，我怕打擾他的工作，在第二次會見他的時候就向他聲明，要求他不在工作的時間能賜教，他說「我整個光陰放在雕刻室內外出的時間是很少的，你找我也是雕刻室內最便，旁的地方很少我的蹤跡的」我就發覺雷氏所以有如此成就的因素。</p>
<p>一九卅一年余由法赴比，入比京皇家美術院，知隆巴和羅沙是比國兩大雕刻家，隆巴以雄健，羅沙以秀柔，名震全歐，英國政府欲搜購比國現代的雕刻來充實他的美術館，就選購了隆巴氏的大理石像「第一朝」陳列在倫敦的Teate　Gallerie美術館，爲當代比國雕刻的代表作，翌年余得從隆巴老師習雕塑，他對於面與綫的連續不盡處和力之起點及終點，凹凸明暗的爭讓，重心的活用等等，都不是其他藝術家那裏聽得到，也不是書籍上讀得到的，在他的雕刻上可以看得到，但需要相當的程度，他秉性最不耐煩，學生們在習作稍有疏忽，就要被他罵出門，比皇亞爾培崩，新皇雷奧博登位，比雕刻家都去接洽希望能刻新皇新后像於宮中，獨隆巴埋頭雕刻室中未去，結束新皇使人邀請隆巴，隆巴答應為他造象，但不肯在宮中工作他說「宮中規矩大，拘束不自由，請陛下到雕刻室」於是新皇每天帶了衛隊到隆巴雕刻室坐一點鐘，直至泥塑完成，一個埋頭工作的作家是不會被埋沒了的。</p>
<p>一天我誤穿了皮鞋，在黃右黑，奔進皇家美術院，爬上級機習泥塑，同學們咄：窘笑，我莫名其所以，一位同學來近了我耳邊說「你誤穿了皮鞋，人家在笑你」我俯視之下，紅了臉擡不起頭來了，這是多麼窘的事，我是一個中國人，在外人面前如此衣冠不整，同學們善意的告訴我「本這來無妨，但我們歐人的習慣，沒有人穿鴛鴦鞋的」我接着就聲明「我們中國人也沒有的這是我自己糊塗」門響處隆巴老師進來了，大家一陣笑，隆巴問為何笑那是我更窘了，我自己走上老師面前申說：「我每天晚上又跟瑪練習雕刻，晚歸很疲，隨意脫鞋，今朝天雨而黑暗，穿錯了鞋，莫怪同學笑，我自己也在笑，隆巴說：「這沒甚希奇，我忘打領帶結進美院不止一次了，你可問問同學們」，於是大家又陣歡笑，隆巴繼續說：「把頭腦全部用在工作上了，往往顧不到那些零星事」翌年雕塑大賽中我悻列首獎獲比皇金章，隆巴用詼諧的語調向與賽者說：「今天你們瞧，穿鴛鴦鞋的跑上前去」我說：「我獲首獎是僥倖的，因為我明知有三四人作風比我勝，我平時也常請教他們的，然在這次比賽中，他們大概緊張了些，我因為自知必無希望獲獎，倒定心工作了，所以體獲首獎」隆巴豐美花白的鬍鬚中笑出來說：「中國人講禮貌講謙讓，也是藝術家應有的態度」與賽者羣集挽我兩臂要我請他吃咖啡，並要每人一杯啤酒，明天早上，模特兒換新姿，我們又鑽入工作緊張的空氣裏了。雕塑這一個立體的藝術，是面面觀的，是佔據空間的，綫的迴旋，塊的恒賽，裏面的量感，表面的觸覺，姿態，動作，含義，示意，……等等，許多許多的條件，非常時期的習練，是不能解決的，說聲雕塑，銅與大理石又是完全不同技巧，所以每個大雕刻家都嘆人生年齡的太短促，不能完成他們的理想，捏了三年五年的黏土，空來做做忙了停一時，把大半天的時間用在製作以外的，是不會有何成就的，諸大家總口一辭的結論雕刻這藝術，工具材料上的困難需要極成熟的技巧，單憑天才是不成事的，而要練成這些技巧須久年的不斷練習，但這是指有藝術上的價值的雕刻而言，否則隨便捏幾個像是無所謂的，學西畫的都習過一二年雕塑，五六歲的孩子握到瀾泥就做成一個圓子，甚至一隻狗。</p>
<h3>蓉城憶語</h3>
<p>— 劉大杰</p>
<p>我在成都住過兩年多，最愛的是那裏的春天。在那時候曾寫過幾十首歌詠成都春天的詩，現在都散失了。百花潭，草堂寺，薛濤井望江樓那些好地方，到今天還不能忘記。我時常想把那些景色，寫一點留下來，因為自己老是在忙裏窮裏度着這緊張的生活，幾乎沒有一刻能輕鬆自己的頭腦，今天先寫下這一點點，但也只畫出一個微小的輪廓。</p>
<p>成都天氣，熱的時候不過熱，冷的時候不過冷。水分很多，陰晴不定，宜於養花木，不宜於養人。因此住在成都的人，氣色沒有好的，而花木無一不好的。在北平江南一帶不容易看見的好梅花，成都有，在外面看不見的三四丈的玉蘭，二三丈高的夾竹桃，成都也有。據一位植物學專家說，成都的蘭花，有二百七十種以上。外面把蘭花看重得寶貝一般成都的蘭，真是遍地都是，賤得如江南一帶的油菜花。在抗戰以前，三分錢可以買一大把。從外面來的朋友，沒有一個人不罵成都的天氣，但沒有人不愛成都的花木。</p>
<p>成都那城市，很有一點京派的風味。栽花種竹，對酒品茗，在生活中佔了重要的一部份。一個窮人家住的房子，院子裏總有幾株花木，一年四季，不斷地開着鮮艷的花，點綴着可愛的青翠。他們都懂得培植，懂得襯貼。一　小竹的旁面，襯着紅梅，薔薇的附近，植着橙柑，這種襯貼扶持，顯出調和，顯出不單調。</p>
<p>成都的春天，恐怕要比北平早一月多罷。二月半到三月半，是梅花盛開的時候，街頭巷尾，院裏墻間，無處不是梅花的顏色綠梅以清淡勝，硃砂以嬌艷勝，粉梅則品不高，然在無錫梅園蘇州鄧慰所看見的，則大半是這種粉梅也。「疏影橫斜水清淺，暗香浮動月黃昏」林和靖先生的詩確是做得好，成都那裏的許多好梅花，不知道都見過沒有？碧綠·雪白·粉紅·深紅·各種各樣的顏色，配合得適宜而又自然，真夠得上「香雪海」那三個字。</p>
<p>一到二三月底，梅蘭早已過時了。代之而起的是海棠玉蘭桃杏梨李迎春各種花木爭奇鬥艷的熱鬧的餓場面。楊柳早已拖着柔媚的長條，在百花潭院花溪的水邊，悠悠地飄動。大的鳥小的雀，顏色很好看，不知道名字，飛來飛去的唱着歌。薛　井公園也充滿了春意，有老詩人在那裏遊春，有的在吹簫唱曲，有的在垂釣彈箏，那種情味比起西湖上的風光，全是兩樣。</p>
<p>花朝，是成都花會開幕的日子。地點在南門外十二橋邊的青羊一宮。花會期有一個月。這是個成都青年男女解放的時期。花會與上海的浴佛節有點相像，不過成都的是以賣花為主，再輔助着各種遊藝與各地的出產。平日我們在街上不容易看到豔妝的婦女，到這時候，成都人傾城而出，賣花的，賣花的，看人的，被人看的，摩肩擦背，真是擁擠得不堪。繡花鞋，花邊褲，桃色的衣裳，捲捲的頭髮，五光十色，無奇不有，與其說是花會，不如說是成都人展覽會。好像是悶居了一年的成都人，都要借這個機會來發洩一下似的。醉的大醉，鬧的大鬧，最高興的，還是小孩子，手裏抱着風車風等，口裏嚼着糖，唱着喊着，想着占人的「無人不道看花回」的句子，真是最妥當也沒有的了。</p>
<p>到百花潭去走走，那情境也極好。對面就是工部草堂，一雙有蓬頂的渡船，時時預備在那裏，你搖一搖手，他就來渡你過去。一潭水清得怪可愛，水淺地方的遊魚，望得清清楚楚，無論你什麽時候去，總有一堆人在那裏釣魚，不管有魚無魚，他們都能忍耐地坐在那裏，談談笑笑，總要到黃昏時候，才一羣一羣地進城。堤邊十幾株大楊柳，垂着新綠的長條，尖子都拂在水面上，微風過去，在水面上搖動着美麗的波紋。</p>
<p>沒有事的時候，你可以到茶館裏去坐一坐。茶館在成都真是遍地都是，一把竹椅，一張不成樣子的木板桌，你可以泡一碗茶，可以坐一個下午。在那裏你可以看到許多平日你看不見的東西。有的賣字畫，有的賣圖畫，有的賣舊衣服。你有時候，可以用最少的錢，買到一些很好的物品。郊外的茶館，有的臨江，有的在花木下面，你坐在那裏，喝茶，吃花生米，可以悠悠地欣賞自然，或是讀書，或是睡覺，你都很舒服。高起興來，還可以呌來一兩樣蔡，半斤酒，可以喝得薰薰大醉，坐着車子進城，你所感到的，只是輕鬆與悠閒，如外面都市中的那種緊張的空氣，你會一點也感不到。我時常想，一個人在成都都住得久了，會變成一個懶人，一個得過且過的懶人。</p>
<h3>夜</h3>
<p>— 悱村</p>
<p>夜又命人思索：</p>
<p>黑幕裏的永遠的謎。</p>
<p>「安靜與柔蜜，」</p>
<p>枕上的一對戀人說：</p>
<p>一個小孩怯怯地：</p>
<p>「你藏着綠眼的貓精，</p>
<p>他變做老婦吸取我們的腦髓；</p>
<p>還有長舌紅髮的女吊，</p>
<p>從荒野的老樹</p>
<p>跳到獨宿者的夢邊。」</p>
<p>荒淫的浪子痛苦了，</p>
<p>說：夜是一面瑩澈的鏡，</p>
<p>照見他心裏蠕動的蛆蟲。</p>
<p>古屋的一個　婦啜泣着：</p>
<p>「呵，夜，你是一篇最纏綿</p>
<p>悱惻的墓誌銘，</p>
<p>帶着亡人的笑容來枕邊，</p>
<p>換取我們絕望無告的眼淚。」</p>
<h3>驕傲和悲哀</h3>
<p>— 施濟美</p>
<p>曾經，我聽到一個朋友惆悵的歎息：「從前我有孤獨者的驕傲，現在我只有孤獨者的悲哀了。」起先我歡喜他這話說得聰明，但是再一思索之後，我知道這句話除了字眼用得似有道理之外，意義却是愚蠢的。事實上。孤獨者所驕傲的，只不過是他的悲哀而已，並且他的悲哀就是他的驕傲造成的。</p>
<p>凡是健康心理的人，將不是驕傲的，也並不悲哀，因為人生絕不可能孤獨，在我們的週遭－這廣漠的人海中；有不在少數的臉是不陌生的，我們有許多相識；並且還有一二知己，是的，這已經足夠不寂寞了，你還能怨天尤人的嚷着孤獨嗎？</p>
<p>在寂寞的各園裏，松的堅貞，竹的虛懷，梅的皎潔，他們成了歲寒三友，菊花並非不能耐寒，但是牠太孤芳自賞了。友誼的花園中，那些驕傲而悲哀的人正像菊花一樣，他的孤獨非環境使然，乃是自己造成了這特殊的癖性。我們固然不必「千紅萬紫」，但是過份的「孤芳自賞」也不頂好的。</p>
<p>你不相信我的話嗎？</p>
<p>托爾斯泰死了，高爾基追憶他：「當這個人在着的時候，我就不是一個人獨個兒活在世界上的孤兒了。」顯然的，有托爾斯泰，高爾基就不孤獨。</p>
<p>諸葛亮祭周瑜文，有「…魂若有靈，以鑒我心，從此天下更無知音…」我們因此明白，雖然周瑜曾那樣好幾次的為難他，但是諸葛亮却用至誠的眼淚哭他的知音，因為有周瑜在，諸葛亮不感覺孤獨，他希望知音永久的活着，寗願敵人不死。</p>
<p>那樣偉大的高爾基，那樣絕頂聰明的諸葛亮，還有他們不孤獨的辰光，難道我們倒更不容易碰着一二個所喜歡的朋友嗎？難道你真的不曾因了一封至誠的信，幾句由衷的話，而流過眼淚麼？難道你從不曾被一些可愛的事情感動過麼？難道，在記憶裏，就真不能有幾個影子讓你緬懷終生麼？</p>
<p>走江湖的好漢，他們知道「出外靠朋友」，綠林裏講究的是疏財仗義，在異鄉的風塵中，即使漢不相識，一旦萍水相逢，也會哈哈一笑，大聲叫着「四海之內，皆兄弟也」，三言兩語之後，於是撮土為香，結為生死之交。－人間事有什麽比這更快人心的呢？如果說「一見傾心」是緣定三生，那麼「一見如故」又何曾不是三生有幸？我永遠憧憬着「相逢何必曾相識」的友誼。</p>
<p>你還要說自己孤獨嗎？那麼，親愛的，想一想那句老話吧！「這世界是一面鏡子，你對着牠笑，牠也對这你笑；你哭，鏡子也在哭。」我不敢嗔你是獨善其身，但是我在想，想像你是那麼落落寡合，使人家難於接近。其實。與其用太多的辰光在思量自己，何不稍微欣賞一下旁人呢？你會快樂的，假使你肯。</p>
<p>那些孤獨者，我管他們呌做「驕傲而悲哀的可憐人」，是他自己自作聰明的走上了高峻的無人的危樓，極目四顯，却又莫明其妙的嚷着：「孤獨呀！這個世界拋棄了我。」夭知道是這個世界拋棄了他？還是他拋棄了這世界？</p>
<p>這個世界，友誼爲牠鋪染了悅人的色彩，假使沒有朋友，那麼，這些山，這蔚藍的天空，瑰麗的黃昏，詩與畫，典雅的樂章又有何用呢？</p>
<p>人生是友誼。</p>
<h3>朝霞</h3>
<p>— 蘇丹</p>
<p>你看，多末鮮艷啊！那微紅的朝霞。</p>
<p>你爲什麽不理我？</p>
<p>呵！爲什麽不說話，是怕驚走三月的季節風嗎？</p>
<p>怎麼？你流淚啦！孩子，不要這樣，哭什麽呢？你難道不知道哭泣是一種恥辱嗎？應該堅強起來，拭乾你的眼淚吧！你是珍惜着別離；抑是怕那長路迢迢？</p>
<p>年紀還輕呢？勇敢些，冒着艱苦，做一個風塵的旅人，嚐一些那晨風和夜露吧！讓我告訴你，如今，江南的綠草已枯萎了。</p>
<p>爲什麽又這樣幽幽的太息呢？你是太息那天涯的颿流的夢淒清嗎？不要這樣，不要把心情收縮得那末沉重，輕鬆點笑笑吧！多想些歡樂的事，別離並不是那麼悲愁，而且不久還會聚首的呀！</p>
<p>雖然我有殘破的嗓子，且為你歌一曲迎春之頌，給你送行。</p>
<p>你還踟躕嗎？你說，什麽是你所眷戀的呢？沒有嗎？那就最好了，抬起你的頭來，不要現出怯場的樣子，年輕的人是應該挺起胸跨着大步走。</p>
<p>再讓我們緊緊的握一次手，不用遲疑了，日趁這破曉時光，朝霞尚璀璨的時候，就開始你的行程吧！我期望你得到豐滿的收成。</p>
<p>好，去吧！珍重些！</p>
<p>遠行的旅人呵！願你的生命永遠是朝霞，璀璨的。</p>
<h3>雙宿雙飛　（四二）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>（十）</p>
<p>石玉樓私人雇了一位琴師，他像四大名旦一樣，自己有自己的調門，如果不是熟琴師，很難和他合作。而擾伶的成功，十分之三是要靠琴師的幫助，所以，一位琴師對於一位擾伶的關係，非常的重大。琴師固然賴擾伶吃飯，而擾伶沒有琴師便不能夠登台，古今一般的擾伶，都很尊敬琴師。而且往往一位擾伶的技藝，就是他的琴師所傳授。因為一位琴師，同樣會唱着許多戲齣，不然的話，他也無從配奏於擾伶。</p>
<p>石玉樓的這位琴師，是到北京以後才搭檔上的。這位琴師呌張弦，很年輕，不過廿四五歲。生着一雙三角眼，看人總帶着些邪氣。鷹勾鼻子，方嘴，不用開口，就讓你有幾分怕他，但是雖然這副長相不太可觀，天才却有。琴的技術據說高明不在梅蘭芳的琴師之下。而且還讀了些書，會編編戲齣。因此，他很自負，也很驕傲。他不但替石玉樓配奏，還常常指正石玉樓關於戲齣　藻上的錯誤。所以石玉樓給他的報酬很大，幾乎佔去了石玉樓每月包銀的二分之一。儘管如此，他並不滿足，他常常威脅石玉樓說：「當琴師沒有教戲掙錢，收三五個徒弟，每月就可以掙百而八十吊。」可如今，他只能每月得到四十吊錢的報酬。四十吊錢對於他確不算多，因為他相當的花消大，吃，喝，嫖，賭，無所不來。據說這也是表現他多才的地方。</p>
<p>石玉樓正為着這種威脅恐慌，適巧墨太太願意讓麗華學戲，翁二太太也願意讓麗雲學戲，這真是天上掉下來的機會！石玉樓收徒弟是假，他不過是代張弦拉生意罷了，為的是這樣可以牽制位張弦。</p>
<p>張弦知道了這個消息，心眼兒樂得開了花！如今他算是一舉兩得了，一方面照舊作琴師，一方面兼收徒弟。他非常感激石玉樓對於他的體恤，爲了報名石玉樓這個情誼，他對學費很客氣地謙讓，每月，麗華和麗雲兩個人，他只肯收廿吊錢。但是講好了一年三節，必須照例送禮。還有，就是正式登台以後，每月按包銀的百分之廿率分給他，這呌做撫恤金，十年為限。這些條件石玉樓都和墨太太與翁二太太談妥了。墨太太是不懂這一行的規矩，所以只有任着他們怎說怎好，樣樣同意。而翁二太太雖然懂，却爲了要討石玉樓的歡心，也只有件件依從。張弦看見這個買賣作成了，便擇了個黃道吉日舉行拜師大典。</p>
<p>大典就在石玉樓的屋裏舉行，事先墨太太買了些禮物　贈張弦。這一天的酒宴是石玉樓辦的，他說明另一個作用是爲墨太太接風。</p>
<p>麗華和麗雲像兩個小傀儡，任着大人們擺佈，先向梨園老祖磕頭，然後向張弦磕頭。臨時張弦又叫他們也向石玉樓磕頭，因為關於手段工夫，還需要石玉樓協助教授，因為石玉樓正唱着戲，教起來方便些。</p>
<p>屋裏燈火輝煌，賓客滿座，宛如過年一般景象，儀式完畢以後，大家同聲贊麗華生得標緻，大家的估計，麗華將來的扮相一定好看，也一定能紅起來。因為粉墨登場的玩意兒就是賞臉。所以當時決定叫麗華青衣花衫，塵雲學鬍生。一則想像中塵雲帶起鬍子來很適宜；一則他們將來還可以搭檔。這些話說得墨太太心裏直癢，好像自己的女兒，就要變成一棵搖錢樹似的。她的老運想不到走在女兒的身上！張弦也很高興，他心裏想：只要徒弟有希望，能紅，便不怕沒代價。而且，他也確實怪喜歡麗華的。</p>
<p>麗華這時候惶惑的很，她並不知道這時他已經成為兩個人心目中的生活靠山！但他只覺得這些人對他都沒有懷着好意。悄悄離開了他們；她回到自己的屋裏，（現在，墨太太也住在這個公寓裏，）關上了房門，不知怎的，一陣心酸，禁不住臥到床上哭了起來！她怨墨太太曾經許過她來北京讓她念書，而如今只是一個謊！於是這時她深深的想墨老爺了，想那童年墨老爺所授予她的教育，也想賓鈴，她後悔沒有學賓鈴，也堅持留在家裏！她記得墨老爺生前爲了墨太太常常看戲而生氣的事，她直覺地意識到「戲」不是一個好玩意兒，但她却被墨太太逼着去學戲了！她是多麼地對不起墨老爺呵！她始終相信墨老爺是對的，因為墨老爺有學問。可是墨老爺沒了，她便只有跟着墨太太往不對的路上走，甚或是往壞的路上走！儘管她不樂意，但沒法不服從墨太太，她是她的母親！因此墨太太有權利隨便處置她，也許墨太太是善意的，但這善意是錯的！她知道這些，却不知道如何去逃避這可怕的前途？她的脆弱的小心靈，開始顫憟了！</p>
<p>麗雲歡天喜地的在外面敲門進來，麗華直是不開，任麗雲廝破喉嚨地喊，也不去理！因為她這會兒有些氣麗雲了，她氣她竟那麼快活！她氣她一點也不能幫助自己，安慰自己！</p>

<h3>殺頭</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>誰叫我們沒有米喫？</p>
<p>不法糧商，貪污糧官。</p>
<p>他們操縱，抬價，囤積，投機，使米糧飛漲，使米糧在市場上逐漸短缺，使我們喫貴的米，使我們出不起高的價錢買米喫，以致使我們沒有米喫。</p>
<p>就是他們要我們全市幾百萬人的命，並不是「以眼還眼，以牙還牙」，為了生存，我們大多數人也有理由要他們幾個人的命。</p>
<p>現在已查出一個有不法運用糧貸的嫌疑者，那就是三泰米行的經理吳蓉生，和五昌米行的經理榮永明。倘使證據確鑿真有上項情事，我們全市市民有權利要求當局處以重刑，為其他不法糧商貪污糧官戒：</p>
<p>殺頭示眾的方法也許太野蠻了，然而叫我們活活餓死的方法，那算得文明的嗎？</p>
<p>治亂世，用　典，這個混亂的上海，簡直不像個世界，一兩隻頭落地後，空氣也許會清明一點。</p>
<h3>孫殿英龐炳勛</h3>
<p>— 柳絮</p>
<p>寫在前面</p>
<p>孫殿英和龐炳勛這兩位，在許多國人眼目視聽之下，大約不會見得怎麼樣的陌生，尤其是黃河流域中的同胞，因為他倆的「功績」「事業」，恆足直接或間接替我們老百姓招致災禍的危機，所以引起我們極深刻的注意和關懷。像孫先生的「東陵掘墓」，「綏遠角逐」，和龐先生的參加台兒荘戰役，太行山被俘，這些繁重節目的演出，都是有聲有色，到現在雖已事過境遷，猶是餘音繞樑，仍是令人懷想，到底他倆是怎麼樣的一個角色呢？「綠林好漢」，「國賊」，「功臣」，「漢奸」，「地下工作者」，似乎都曾串演過；並且，每多扮演入神，恰到好處，像一個多才多藝的伶工，生，旦，凈、丑、末，無一不通，如果要十分明確的判斷他倆的身份，實在不是一件很容易的事。好在事實俱在，只要我們細細地體會，大可作我們下定論的參考。</p>
<p>被俘？投降？</p>
<p>三十二年夏的太行大會戰，是四月開始到八月才終了，整整的五個月，敵人發動了四個師團和三個旅團的兵力，時日的長久和兵力的雄厚，這不能說不是一次大的會戰了。</p>
<p>孫殿英和龐炳勛他倆也就是這次戰役被俘虜的。俘虜的時日地點，固然不同，就是被俘的情形，也有很大的差異，首先，孫殿英在臨淇縣境的一個小村荘裹被俘，事前沒有經過什麼劇烈的戰鬥，僅僅幾個炮彈的前奏，敵人便順便的進入到他的司令部，他就很馴良的歸順了，據太原　報上的記載：同時被俘的，有他的幕僚和衛士三百多人，每人都具有三枝以上的槍枝的自衛裝備——一枝長槍或輕機關槍，一枝手槍和兩枝煙槍。可是，他們並沒有浪費過一顆子彈，大家都很乖巧的　著一個敵軍中尉和會長走近孫殿英的跟前，向他作極恭順的敬禮。</p>
<p>接著龐炳勛也在陵川、壺關、林縣交壤的三交口附近被俘虜了。他躲在一個山洞裹，地點非常隱蔽，很不容易發覺，據說還是孫殿英派他的秘書當嚮導才搜索到的。被俘的時候，有他的三個隨從和他的兒子，他本想拿手槍自殺，大約還是缺少勇氣吧，被他的兒子勸阻沒有成功，這是頂大的遺憾「國賊」「功臣」的區分，完全維繫在這一顆小的手槍子彈上面呢。</p>
<p>部隊的歸宿</p>
<p>孫殿英的新五軍和龐炳勛的四十軍，都富有極度濃厚的封建積習，都是以他個人為部隊的中心信仰，並未如何的進入軍隊國家化的理想境地。所以孫殿英被俘虜後的新五軍，從二等兵到高級部隊長，沒有一個不歸順到「和運」旗幟之下，一團一師有計劃有順序的開到新鄉報到。</p>
<p>四十軍的情境可不同了：他們有氣節，有斤兩；不願意當漢奸，作奴隸。在龐炳勛俘虜以後，部隊由副軍長馬法五指揮，逐漸向陵川壺關的二十七軍靠攏，繼續作劇烈的戰鬥，迄至奉到中央的指示後，才南渡到洛陽集結整訓，沒有一個官兵，作過自發的卑賤的投降。從這點看來，四十軍的優於新五軍，龐炳勛的優於孫殿英，事實已經很詳盡的告訴了我們，用不著他倆多餘的自白和申辯。</p>
<p>走單幫的毒販子</p>
<p>孫殿英還有一件對不起國家和民族的事，他的幹部都是有名的毒販子，以軍人身份來掩護作販運毒品的勾當，還真辱及國家民族呢！我們時常見到一個兩個新五軍的官兵，經常奔走於洛陽臨淇的道途中，腰間無不懷孕著上好的黑貨。間或還有一批一批的牲口　載著大宗的鴉片，紅丸、白麵，由太行山公開的運到洛陽去吸收法幣。好像和洛陽的長官部和河防部隊，成立了默契的諒解，從始至終，從沒有問過亂子！</p>
<p>為什麼躲在山洞裹？</p>
<p>龐炳勛是二十四集團軍的總司令，四十軍軍長，河北省政府主席，太行山軍區的最高軍事長官，以這麼一個首腦人物，為什麼到了戰況緊張的時際，幹嗎放棄了部隊的掌握，獨個兒跑到山洞裹藏起來？這個啞謎，到今天為止，還沒有獲得事實的解答。</p>
<p>據說龐炳勛是個跛子，走起路來一拐一拐的不良於行，並且體重超逾常人，無論行軍作戰，經常需要四個人抬著，不然的話，就寸步難移。我們應當知道：太行山不比上海南京，並沒有光滑平坦的柏油路，那兒盡是些羊腸鳥道，峭壁懸崖，除了走路，再也沒有法子容許其他代步的交通工具，所以他只好躲在洞裏，企圖脫免這巨大的災害。</p>
<p>這種解釋，或許近於牽強，但是，除此以外，實在沒有法子說明；從令還有其他的原因，我們沒有獲得事實以前，不便作臆測的懸揣，個中真相那只有上帝知道。</p>
<p>不眛天良</p>
<p>這次戰役裏面，被俘虜的官兵，沒有精確的統計數字，只好以不少來代表這個疑問。孫殿英和龐炳勛在新鄉設立招待所，專門收容二十四集團軍離散的官兵，和接收由敵人引導過來的俘虜。他倆還算不眛天良，只要自己不甘心附敵的話，他倆都很慷慨的幫助你南渡。就是大的部隊突圍歸來，只要事實允可，他倆亦能予以方便。　第八縱隊和四十五師的一部，都是擁有一千以上的兵力，硬從敵寇層疊包圍之下，迂迴曲折的衝了出來，孫殿英龐炳勛在側旁不無有幫助的徽勞呢。</p>

<h3>貴族咖啡館　　每杯咖啡萬元</h3>
<p>— 馮饒</p>
<p>百業不景氣之中，惟咖啡館仍林立　　，未稍遜色，據悉全上海現有七八十家之多。聞將於最近開張者，尙有數家，其中有一「絕對貴族化」之咖啡館將出現於成都路，聞每杯咖啡價目定为一万元，原擬命名為「貴族咖啡館」，嗣因貴族字眼太刺激，故有易名為「中美」之說。據業中人談：「上海人喜吃　　，價錢　貴　能引起注意。可謂一語道破上海人之虛榮心理。」</p>
<p>又悉「中美」之背景為「四姊妹」，其用在墻壁上之裝修費，即達一萬萬元之巨，小妮子有此魄力，豈不令公眾人員為之愧煞！所謂「人比人，氣煞人」，實為至理名言。</p>
<p>全市妓院登記，業經核准者計有六百餘家，而妓女經檢驗合格者，則僅為二百餘人，以此比例而言，則將來妓女勢非身兼數院不可？未知當局對「不合格」者將如何處理？</p>
<p>頃悉漢口　場，頗多通宵　　，　讓風光不减大上海。最近當局製定辦法，規定舞女必須在十八歲以上始准營業，十七歲者將追令改業。預料今後漢口舞女　將「年年十八歲」而無疑。但最令人不解者，十八歲與十七歲之間，不知有何「大不同」處也？</p>
<h3>王雲五會拉黃包車</h3>
<p>— 余謙</p>
<p>王雲五現在做了經濟部部長了。</p>
<p>此君塊頭大，喉嚨大，每次在參政會開會時，常常一言震驚四座，頗像唱大花臉的少山。有人將他和王曉　作為參政會二王標準的　大嗓子。</p>
<p>他主持商務印書館頗著成績，在重慶，他住在下半城白象街商務印書館分館，往來市區，一把雨傘，安步當車，是吳稚老的同志。</p>
<p>曾經有人和他談及做人做事的成功之道，他有一個比喻，他說：「我好像在重慶拉黃包車，走上坡路的時候，拚命用足氣力向上拉；走下坡路的時候，盡量求其慢，把穩車槓，一步一步，不慌不忙；」</p>
<p>這個道理大家不妨仔細地思索一下。</p>
<h3>教堂　諷刺</h3>
<p>— 蠡</p>
<p>上海有一座教堂，它所處的地點，是一種諷刺，你說：這是哪個教堂？在什麼地方？（答案見明日本版）</p>
<h3>不要敷衍</h3>
<p>— 許玉麟</p>
<p>中國有句俗語：「做日和尙撞日鍾」，這句話是形容過著敷衍生活的人們，目前本市多數的大公司廠商，甚至是市政機關，內部都呈現著敷衍的局面，人情上是處處敷衍，公事上也是面面敷衍。由於大家相互敷衍，人人都抱著將就了事的態度，影響所及，直接使行政效能减低或廠商業務停滯，間接造成了國家衰弱和社會不景氣。不論是公共機關或商號工廠，工作人員如果都抱著敷衍的心理，就等於大家不合作。試問一家工廠，如果廠足與員工個個相互敷衍了事，還能夠達到减低成本與改良出品的理想嗎？同樣的一個地方機關，辦事人員如果人人喜歡敷衍，不肯一心一意真誠合作，也休想推進地方行政效率。</p>
<p>所以我覺得現在要解決國家的難題和消除地方的不安狀態，有一點很重要的，就是應該掃除社會上的敷衍氣氛，庶幾行政效率能夠增進，工商業能夠獲得切實發展，這樣才可使祖國與列強各國并駕齊驅。</p>

<p>警察已換上草綠色的夏季服裝了。</p>
<p>記得光緒廿年的「上海彝場景緻」裏說：</p>
<p>「工部局所設巡捕，半為西人，半為華人。華人由有業者具保承充，衣有中西號數，左右圓圈內有中西號碼，使人易識畫則分段查街，夜則腰懸暗燈。西捕掛刀，華捕執棒，通宵巡緝。」</p>
<p>民國十二年再版的「上海遊覽指南」裏有如下的記載：</p>
<p>「昔時上海華捕著平人之服，戴瓜皮之帽，惟短衣胸前有兩白線鏽成之圈，乃第幾名號碼之中西文字也。」</p>
<p>「後易制戴前　之紅纓帽，夏則凉帽，胸前有光亮之銅鈕，腰束漆皮帶，夏白襪而冬皂靴，似威風矣。至近日，革靴軍帽，而無辨，其情形則與軍人一式。今日華捕所戴之帽與昔日西捕所戴之帽一式，三十年前西捕乃易戴銅帽式之式，至今未嘗改易。」</p>
<p>現在回想起一頂紅纓帽搖幌在南京路街頭，那是怎樣一幅情景。</p>
<h3>肉的移植</h3>
<p>— 鋼人</p>
<p>一切的疾病，都是人類的大敵，牠摧殘了人的身體，消滅了人的生命，更有許多不能治愈的絕症。但是人類的科學家、醫學家們，卻並不懼怕，要憑著他們大無畏的精神，致力於克服疾病，解救人類的工作，一步更進一步。</p>
<p>國際醫學聯盟—美國洛格非勒基金會，在最近一次的報告表上，除了報告一年來克服各種疾病如斑疹傷寒、瘧疾、黃熱病與結核菌的研究工作，並建議組織國際醫學聯盟，共同研究各種空氣傳染時疫，發揚防止消滅的工作；一方面利用空運便利迅速，將廢棄海港檢疫以前消極的陳舊方法。</p>
<p>盲人福音—美國，紐約醫院最近聯合其左近十九個醫院，組織成立一「眼睛銀行」。儲蓄活的眼睛角膜—包看眼睛的透明體；保藏在一個封閉而有冷熱設備的容器裏，容器裏是裝著特種藥品的。預備給那些被火燒、病毒及其他所損壞角膜而致盲的人們，作為復明之用，因為那些人的其他部分如神經綱膜均為完全。「眼移植」工作雖早已發現，正式有規模的應用尙為初次。</p>
<p>當得到本人的遣命，或法定人的允許，死去人們的眼角膜可在四小時內取下保養；生下即死的孩子，也是「贈養者」；而有不能治愈的盲人，也可以貢獻他完美的角膜。現在用這樣的方法，五個盲人中就有一個可以復明。</p>
<p>牛乳的新效用—乳汁在未來的化學工業上將是一種重要而可貴的原料；美國科學家們已從其中提鍊出許多種產品：如麻醉劑、顏料、橡皮和可曲折的玻璃。從乳漿精裏可以提出各種極有用途的藥品，如著名的「配尼西林」，殺菌的麻醉劑，還有一種乳酸基　　，用在使因重創或行外科手術後的血液中，其他尙有軍事上的特種藥品，設用於平時，同樣將增人類幸福。</p>
<p>新「肉」移植—美國紅十字會曾將人們的「輸血」製成血漿，為戰時救傷服務，最近又有改進，即製成中含纖維血素等的血漿；為傷者移植的新肉皮膚，為施行手術用時，先浸取血漿液體，該成分等自動促成血纖維黏接劑，不但同時止血，且使外科醫生所不能縫接的地方，如手指、足趾間，黏接成功。</p>
<p>治結核菌的新藥—人們在克服結核菌的工作上，又更進了一步，密勒和萊克二博士發現另一種配尼西林同族的青微素，雖尙未在人身實驗，然人類的結核菌，移植在豚鼠身上，百分之百足以致其死命，而經注射後數日，雖該藥與配尼西林同樣衹能制止繁殖，間接殺滅；但發現該菌已失敗。兩博士乃更進一步，研究何種元素等有如此效用。</p>
<p>「鉭」的功用製造—尋覓已久的完善的外科手術用具的金屬，　已發現「鉭」最合乎理想。因為它堅牢、柔韌、不銹、無毒、無害，可以製成各種形式，遇到血液也無「電化作用」；並可用以修復人身的缺陷，鉭製的片、線、箔，可以用來修補腦鼻部的骨骼，損壞部分；鉭在外科醫術上，已佔重要的地位。</p>

<h3>Jilin National Army Crosses the Songhua River: Huadian and Qingyuan in Huai'de Are Recaptured in Succession; Railway South of Changchun Is Being Hastily Repaired</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 1st] The national army heading north has crossed the Yaomen Mountains and reached the Songhua River. The major bridge over the Songhua River on the Chinese Changchun Railway has been destroyed by the communist army. After the national army on the Jilin side occupied Yongji, they have crossed the Songhua River and are advancing towards Harbin.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 1st] The train line from Sipingjie through Hailong to Jilin may be restored soon.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 1st] The national army continued to advance eastward from Sipingjie today. According to the Xin Sheng Bao, the vanguard of Du Yuming's troops advanced north from Panshi and reached a certain location. Another team occupied Huadian, 120 li northeast of Panshi. Qingyuan, between Shenyang and Panshi, has also been recovered. The Beining Railway was opened to traffic today. A large bridge north of Shanhaiguan, which was destroyed by the communist army a few weeks ago, has now been repaired.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 1st] Railway workers rushing to repair the railway south from Weichun have now crossed Gongzhuling and are rushing to repair the bridges near Dayushu Station. The section from Changchun to Gongzhuling was completely repaired this afternoon and will be open to passenger and freight traffic within days. The Changchun-Shenyang line is expected to take two weeks to fully recover due to severe damage to the Gongzhuling-Siping section. On the Changchun-Jilin railway, the communist army only partially demolished and blew up the Yinma River Bridge, which has now been repaired. Furthermore, since the national army entered Changchun, all sectors have initiated a campaign to support the troops. Various theater troupes and cinemas are currently preparing a performance for the troops. Schools and civil organizations have also launched a fundraising campaign to support the troops, enlivening the streets.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 1st] Military News: The vanguard of the national army entered Huai'de at 3:00 PM on the 30th. Another unit entered Nong'an. Another unit of the national army advancing east to the north has entered Huadian. When the communist army withdrew from the area, they burned and destroyed it extensively, causing considerable damage. Currently, there are no communist troops on the south bank of the Songhua River. It is reported that the morale of the communist army is low. All those who were coerced from within the customs are defecting to the national army, and those conscripted from outside the customs are deserting.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] Military News: The communist army near Anshan retreated to the mountainous area east of Qianshan at 7:00 AM on the 31st. Tanggangzi Station south of Anshan was also successively recovered by the national army. The railway north of Anshan is currently being urgently repaired, and it is expected to be open to traffic within days. The Pan-Yu direct express train on the Beining Railway began service on the 1st. The train departing from Shenxi left for Shanhaiguan at 7:00 AM this morning.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Changchun, 30th] (Delayed) According to a local banker, the communist army issued 70 million yuan in banknotes during its five-week occupation of Changchun. They also, with the assistance of Japanese technicians, took valuables, including "some gold bars," from the safe of the Changchun branch of the Central Bank. Acting Mayor Shang Chuandao also stated that all local banks will soon resume operations to promote economic activity. There is no sign of panic regarding food supply here, but prices have risen in recent days.</p>
<h3>Formal Establishment of the Ministry of National Defense: Minister Bai and Chief of General Staff Chen Deliver Instructions; Chen to Visit Soviet Union with Marshall Tomorrow to Review Troops</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The Ministry of National Defense was established today. At 7:30 AM, the newly appointed Minister Bai Chongxi, a general, and Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng, a general, gathered over a thousand officers above the rank of major at the ministry's auditorium on Huangpu Road. Minister Bai first delivered instructions, briefly stating that the position of Minister of National Defense carries great responsibility. He had repeatedly requested to resign, but was not approved. He hoped that all personnel would work together to accomplish their mission. Chief of General Staff Chen then spoke, briefly stating that the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense marks a epoch-making reorganization of China's military organization. Future national defense will adopt the military system of a democratic country, making the military subordinate to politics. He then explained the advantages of this system: (1) Applying the theories of military theorists Clausewitz and Ludendorff, and analyzing China's Confucian philosophy, which holds that the military is subordinate to politics. (2) Strengthening the connection and unified command of the army, navy, and air force, which will be established with the formation of the Ministry of National Defense. (3) The division of powers of the Ministry of National Defense is in line with the spirit of China's three-branch administrative system, because the power to decide military policy will rest with the Executive Yuan and the Minister of National Defense. Furthermore, the swearing-in ceremony of Bai and Chen will be held during the National Government Memorial Week next Monday, at which President Chiang will preside and deliver instructions.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 1st] According to reliable sources, Chief of General Staff of the National Defense Department, General Chen Cheng, and Special Envoy Marshall will arrive in Suzhou together on June 3 to participate in a military review ceremony and visit scenic spots. The county government has prepared to host them, and is hastily building an airfield overnight. The ring road under construction is also scheduled to be completed before June 3.</p>
<h3>Over a Million Jin of Soviet Grain: Left to Rot in Warehouses</h3>
<p>County Government Takes Over for Charitable Purposes</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 1st] There are no less than a hundred warehouses left behind by the enemy and puppets in Suzhou, containing countless materials, especially grain. Since the takeover began last September, although it has been transferred several times, it has remained in storage, with no news of any disposal. Since September, much of it has rotted. At a time when grain prices are soaring and people are struggling to survive, abandoning this precious grain to rot is a social contradiction of the utmost gravity, and the people's resentment is extreme. The Second Inspection Team for the Collection of Surrendered Military Armaments and Materials of the Ministry of Military Affairs, recognizing this, has specially approved the distribution of the rotten grain in the warehouses to the poor for relief. Yesterday, it sent a letter to the county government for receipt and distribution, in order to benefit the poor. After receiving the letter, the county government, considering the large quantity of grain, decided that a one-time distribution would only be a passive relief effort, and decided to transfer the grain to a charitable fund for long-term use. It also established a Committee for Receiving and Handling Rotten Grain in Suzhou Warehouses to take charge of proper handling. It is understood that the grain includes 1,146,000 kilograms of rice, wheat, beans, and flour, but unfortunately, it is all rotten.</p>
<h3>Hubei Provincial Bank Loans: To Assist Factory Resumption</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 1st] Chairman Wan convened a symposium with representatives of relevant agencies yesterday to guide the resumption of factories here, and decided to turn to bank loans for assistance.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 1st] The cost of living in Hankou is rising. Shoe workers went on strike yesterday to demand higher wages.</p>
<h3>Pukou Sulfuric Acid Plant: Lacking Funds to Start Production</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The Pukou Sulfuric Acid Plant, famous in the Far East, is a chemical giant in the north, and the first large-scale industry established in Central China by the Yongli Company before the war. The fertilizer that the plant can produce accounts for 15% of the total output in the Far East. Since the victory, the person in charge of Yongli has returned to Nanjing to reorganize it, and has agreed with General MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo to ship back the large set of machinery looted by the enemy from the plant. Currently, the reorganization work is already in place, but a large amount of circulating capital is needed, as simply starting up the entire power system requires 100 million yuan, and three months' worth of raw materials must be purchased in bulk before the work process can be completed. It is reported that the company authorities previously applied to the government for a loan of 3 billion yuan, which was resolved by the Four Banks Joint Office and handed over to the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications for review, but there has been no concrete decision in two months. At a time when Taiwan and other regions urgently need fertilizer, the prolonged shutdown of the plant is deeply regretted by all parties.</p>
<h3>Self-Defense Forces Organized Throughout Eastern Nine Provinces</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 1st] The Northeast Security Commander's Office has ordered the organization of people's self-defense forces in various regions to supplement the insufficient military force of the national army. At the same time, youth work teams and post-war relief societies were formed to assist in comforting and resettling refugees. Jin County has formed a team to comfort and clear the countryside. The Commander's Office has also set up an office in Goubangzi to accommodate volunteer officers and soldiers, providing training and assigning them jobs.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Order Appoints Liang Huasheng as Acting Chairman of Jilin Province</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 1st] The Northeast Headquarters received a telegram from President Chiang today, temporarily appointing Vice Commander Liang Huasheng to act as Chairman of Jilin Province before the arrival of Chairman Zheng Daoru. The Headquarters ordered Liang to take office as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Trip to Tianjin Canceled Due to Official Business: President Chiang to Return to Nanjing Soon; Visited Wen Tianxiang Shrine in Beiping Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] As of tonight, Nanjing has not yet received the exact date of the President's return to the south. However, it is generally observed that President Chiang will personally preside over the Central Memorial Week on the morning of the 3rd. Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi and Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng are scheduled to hold their swearing-in ceremony during that Memorial Week.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 1st] Tianjin Mayor Zhang Ting'e left Beiping for Tianjin on the 1st. Before leaving, he told reporters that President Chiang had summoned him to inquire about the security situation in Tianjin and ordered the adjustment of the salaries in Beiping and Tianjin. As the President will return to Nanjing in one or two days, the trip to Tianjin has been canceled.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 1st] At 11:00 AM on the 1st, President Chiang summoned 21 responsible comrades from the Hebei, Beiping, and Tianjin party groups, as well as special commissioners from various departments, including Liu Yaozhang, Shao Huagu, and Zhang Mingwei, to the headquarters to inquire about their work and provide instructions. At 4:00 PM, President Chiang summoned Fu Sinian, acting president of Peking University, to inquire about the preparations for the resumption of Peking University and the status of university education in Beiping. Fu gave a detailed report for over an hour. Then, President Chiang and Fu departed from the headquarters to inspect the shrine of Wen Chengxiang (Tianxiang). He paid respects to the spirit of Wen Chengxiang, who was loyal to the country and had a spirit of righteousness. He returned to the headquarters at around 6:00 PM. Note that the Wen Chengxiang Shrine is located in Fuxue Hutong in the eastern city and is one of the famous shrines in Beiping.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The municipal government held an evening party at the Huai Ren Tang on the 1st, inviting famous Beiping opera singers and inviting President Chiang and his wife to attend the performance and entertain over 500 Chinese and foreign guests. The President and his wife arrived at the theater at 9:00 PM on the 1st and returned to the headquarters late at night.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] Deputy Secretary-General Zheng Yanfen, on the afternoon of the 1st, represented President Chiang in summoning representatives from colleges and universities and alumni associations in Beiping, expressing that there would be no discrimination against students from recovered areas and stating that there would be no restrictions on students from recovered areas taking exams or seeking employment.</p>
<h3>German Nationals Gather in Shanghai: Awaiting Ship for Repatriation; Fifteen Technicians Requisitioned</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] Thirty-seven German nationals from the Nanjing German National Concentration Camp, including fifteen technicians, have been approved by the Ministry of Interior for requisition. Another two will not be repatriated to their home country for the time being. The remaining twenty will be sent to Shanghai along with the German nationals from the Hankou concentration camp, and will be managed by the Shanghai Municipal German National Management Committee. German nationals from Beiping and Tianjin will also be gathered in Shanghai, and a ship will be sent back to their home country next month.</p>
<h3>Salt Prices Fall in Various Provinces: Free Sale Permitted</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] According to salt administration authorities speaking to reporters, the supply of Huai salt is relatively small. Most of the salt on the market is supplied by Shandong and Fujian. Now that transportation has been restored and can be smoothly transported, the salt prices in the southeastern provinces have fallen. For example, two months ago, the salt price in Hunan was 700 yuan per jin, but now it has fallen to over 300 yuan, and it may continue to decrease. In order to adjust the salt tax, the authorities specifically formulated regulations, which were strictly implemented. From January to May of this year, it was the first phase. Because the salt tax in the rear area was originally higher than in the recovered area, the tax was 7,000 yuan per dan, while the recovered area was taxed at 4,250 yuan per dan. From June to August, it will be the second phase. The salt tax in the rear area will gradually decrease slightly to maintain the status quo. From September to December, it will be the third phase. The salt tax in the rear area, the recovered area, and even the whole country will be completely uniform. The Salt Administration Bureau will adopt a circulation policy for future salt administration, allowing free transport.</p>
<h3>Yellow River Blocking and Dyke Restoration Projects Launched Simultaneously</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 1st] The government has reached an agreement with the Communist Party on the Yellow River blocking and dyke restoration projects, and the upstream and downstream projects will be launched simultaneously. Ma Fengtai of the Henan Branch went to Cao County, Shandong, to set up warehouses, and sent team leader Liu Shangqin and ten team members, along with Lian He senior officials Pan En, Han, and Poole, to Zhazhuang County by special train on June 1 to start construction.</p>
<h3>Pan Xulun, Standing Vice Minister of Economic Affairs, Assumed Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The newly appointed Standing Vice Minister of Economic Affairs, Pan Xulun, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai yesterday and assumed office at the ministry on the 1st. As for Political Vice Minister Xiao Zheng, he has not yet arrived at the ministry because he is still humbly declining the position.</p>
<h3>Pauley Inspects in Korea</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 1st] The office of U.S. Presidential Envoy Pauley here announced that his mission will be to inspect the Korean Ministry of Industry according to plan, but two important industrial areas will not be inspected due to Soviet restrictions. Pauley visited several places yesterday and today. Furthermore, according to Shenyang news, well-informed sources believe that Pauley will not come to Shenyang before the 4th of this month.</p>
<h3>Marshal Drafts Concrete Plan to Promote Peaceful Reception in Northeast: To Be Presented Upon President Chiang's Return to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] It is learned that Marshal Marshall has drafted a concrete plan to promote a peaceful resolution of the reception problem in Northeast China. This news was revealed today by people close to Marshall, who stated that this will be a formal expression of the five-star general's determination to mediate the Northeast problem. It is said that it will be provided to the government for reference after President Chiang returns to Nanjing. Luo Longji, Minister of Propaganda of the Democratic League, met with Marshal Marshall today to discuss the current situation. Furthermore, Yu Dawei, the newly appointed Minister of Transportation, who has met with Marshal Marshall many times in the past, has drafted a comprehensive plan to restore transportation based on the demands of the people of the country and the intentions of the government. The government is determined that this plan must be implemented quickly and thoroughly.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] According to sources in the Youth Party, Lei Zhen, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday to visit Zuo Shunsheng and Chen Qitian, explaining that the Coordinating Small Group may be restored after President Chiang returns to Nanjing and urging the Youth Party representatives to go to Nanjing to prepare for discussions. Some Youth Party representatives are scheduled to go to Nanjing on the 6th, and Lei is scheduled to return to Nanjing this morning.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] A reporter from the Peace Daily here recently discussed the Democratic League's attitude towards the current situation with an observer. According to him, the attitude of Democratic League figures such as Zhang Junmai is still considered fair, but unfortunately, they have failed to grasp the real power of the Democratic League. As for Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun, and others, the so-called pro-communist faction of the Democratic League, they are completely speaking for the Communist Party and covering for the Communist Party, which has been known to people for a long time. For example, in the previous Political Consultative Conference, every time the National Assembly issue was discussed, the Communist Party insisted on re-election of representatives, and the Democratic League echoed it. Recently, the Democratic League secretly spoke for the Communist Party, attacking the United States, believing that the United States' aid to the national army in the north was incomprehensible. In fact, the United States' aid to the national army in receiving sovereignty is an obligation that the United States should fulfill to the Allied countries, and it is also known to the people of the country. The Communist Party used violence to obstruct the national army from receiving the Northeast, and turned to hate the United States, but did not dare to openly oppose the United States, so it used the pro-communist faction of the Democratic League. Clear-sighted people can see through it at a glance.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 1st] Observers here believe that the recent speeches by senior officials and generals have clarified the government's policy towards the Communist Party. Now it remains to analyze the Communist Party's ambiguous attitude. They all said that the speeches by Sun Ke, Xiong Shihui, and Du Yuming have clarified the government's determination to receive the entire Northeast at any cost. As for the possible policies that the Communist Party may adopt, there are three: (1) The Communist Party may insist on force to the end, (2) Or it may abandon its demands, (3) Or it may delay time. Everyone expects that the Communist Party, knowing that its military strength is weak and the call for national peace, may not adopt the first policy. The most likely policy is to delay.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 1st] How to stabilize grain prices in Jiangsu and the actual situation of military grain requisition, amid the nationwide grain shortage, is a matter of concern to millions of people. The reporter specifically asked Liu Yunheng, Director of the Jiangsu Grain Office, and according to him: (1) The food problem in Jiangsu is not as serious as rumored. Regarding the stabilization of grain prices, we are currently following President Chiang's instructions to ensure the smoothness of the source and maintain transportation and sales, and have investigated the grain reserves in various counties. All those who have more than enough grain for their own consumption will be ordered to sell it at a fair price and avoid hoarding. (2) The total number of military grain to be paid by various counties is 630,000 shi. The highest amount to be paid by each county is 80,000 shi, and the lowest is 15,000 shi. In addition to those who have already paid, the total amount owed by various counties is 120,000 shi, and we are urging them to pay. (3) Based on the current situation, there is absolutely no problem with the people's food in Jiangsu. After government investigation and control, grain prices are expected to fall.

<h3>Adjustment Measures for Civil Servant Salaries Submitted to the Chairman for Final Approval; National Defense Council Conducts Four Hours of Repeated Deliberation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The Supreme National Defense Council spent four hours today discussing the draft adjustment measures for civil servant salaries proposed by the Executive Yuan. It was resolved that the entire proposal be submitted to Chairman Chiang for final approval. Today's meeting began at 9:00 AM in the National Government Conference Room, with over thirty committee members in attendance, chaired by Yu Youren. The committee members repeatedly studied and debated the draft proposed by the Executive Yuan for a considerable time, adjourning at 1:00 PM. According to sources, the Executive Yuan's draft was based on the government's principle of adjusting civil servant salaries every three months. Since the adjustment in March of this year, three months had passed by the end of May. However, the source declined to disclose the figures decided by the National Defense Council, only saying that they were lower than even the lowest general expectations. However, the final approval still awaits Chairman Chiang's return to Nanjing. According to evening newspaper reports here today, the Executive Yuan's plan involves increasing the base salary by 400 times and providing a living allowance of 120,000. However, another reliable source revealed that the National Defense Council decided today that the base salary for civil servants would only be over 300 times and the living allowance would be 70,000. However, this applies to the Nanjing-Shanghai area, and there are still differences in figures across the country. Admiral Fraser, Commander of the British Pacific Fleet, is currently en route to Hong Kong. The picture shows Fraser and others after paying respects at the mausoleum in Nanjing.</p>

<h3>The Entire Guangdong-Hankou Railway Line Will Be Open to Traffic Within a Month; The Tian-Lan Railway Will Construct a Branch Line from Longxi to Lintao; The Tianjin-Tanggu Highway Will Open to Traffic on the 11th</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 31st] The entire Guangdong-Hankou Railway line was severely damaged during the War of Resistance. After the victory, orders were given to repair it within a short period. The southern section from Guangzhou to Yuan... section has already been opened to traffic. The Wuchang to Qujiang section was heavily damaged due to the Gao...cun mountain tunnel, and it was temporarily impossible to get through. Therefore, a temporary... road was rebuilt, starting on April 12th, and was built day and night. It was completed in just over ten days and opened to traffic on May 1st. Currently, there is one passenger train running between Wuchang and Qu... and many... trains running in opposite directions on other sections. This completes the transportation artery connecting the three provinces of Hubei, Hunan, and Guangdong. Currently, only a small section of the entire line remains, from Qujiang in Guangdong to Tan... which is being rushed day and night, and it is determined that the entire line will be open to traffic before June. Chairman Chiang sent a telegram to commend the employees of the railway for their hard work in connecting the entire line in a short period.</p>

<h3>Kunming's Speculative Capital Runs Rampant; The Four Banks and Two Bureaus Temporarily Suspend the Supply of Shanghai Exchange; Foreign Cigarettes Are Dumped, Causing Tobacco Factories to Suffer Losses and Close Down</h3>
<p>[Our Kunming Dispatch, 31st] The Kunming financial market suddenly appeared hectic on the 30th and 31st. This was because the June exchange settlement was approaching, and Shanghai markets were transferring funds to Kunming in droves. The Kunming Four Banks and Two Bureaus temporarily suspended the supply of Shanghai exchange, causing the Shanghai exchange rate to rise to 60 yuan, which was still difficult to obtain. Although the market was tight on funds, speculative capital was still rampant. The gold market has not diminished its power, but the price is between 1,200 yuan. The Kunming market has now become the tail of the Shanghai market. Recently, fluctuations in various commodity prices have mostly shifted with the Shanghai market. Cotton yarn rises and falls with the price of gold. Transactions in the cloth district are balanced. Daimaru cloth is said to be priced at 125,000, while carded cloth is gradually weakening. Recently, due to the few Shui Ke (traveling merchants) from Guizhou coming to Kunming to purchase goods, the Kunming market has become weak due to the decline in.... The supply of cigarettes is still pouring in, but major dealers are struggling to maintain market prices, so the price of foreign cigarettes has risen slightly, while the price of domestic tobacco remains weak. There were about 100 large and small cigarette factories in Kunming. Recently, due to the dumping of foreign cigarettes and... cigarettes in Kunming, and the excessive tax rate in Kunming, the factories have suffered huge losses, leading to continued closures. To date, only about 20 remain. The once-prosperous domestic tobacco brands "Double Ninth," "Three Sheep," and "Grand Canal" have all been unable to ship due to losses of over 200,000 yuan per case. In order to demand a reduction in the tax rate, the factories have repeatedly petitioned the Yunnan Commodity Tax Bureau. They once planned to launch a march of 30,000 people, but it was called off due to mediation from all sides. As a result of their petition, the Tax Bureau agreed to reduce taxes by 20%, and the factories can uniformly resume work starting on June 1st.</p>
<h3>Labor Strikes Occur Repeatedly in Kunming; China National Aviation Corporation Branch Suspends Work</h3>
<p>[Our Kunming Dispatch, 31st] The strikes at the clothing factories in Kunming contracted by the Logistics Department have lasted for over a month and have not yet been resolved. Yesterday, a worker at the First Clothing Factory used a handgun to forcibly demand a dismissal fee of 350,000 yuan from the manager, and said that if this amount was not..., the result would be the manager going to the hospital and me (the worker claiming) going to court. After mediation, the worker.... Also, the Kunming...method... workers have also demanded... for adjusting salaries. In short, in recent months, there has been a wave of demands for adjustments from civil servants, teachers, and workers in Kunming. The reason is that the special prices in Kunming have mostly returned to... status, making life still extremely difficult. People generally believe that since the War of Resistance has been won, they should no longer suffer, which is one reason. Some institutions have higher salaries, leading to cries of injustice. The reason given by... large professors is that the salaries of technical workers have increased twenty times compared to before the war, while their goal is only half or a quarter of that, which is the second reason. There are also many problems caused by demobilization fees or dismissals, but there are still many who take the opportunity to demand higher salaries during the demobilization period when rear area talents are increasingly shifting. In addition, the air crew of the Kunming branch of the China National Aviation Corporation stopped working on the 29th, closing the doors, demanding that their salaries be paid in foreign currency. It is reported that the Ministry of Communications is doing its best to mediate, and work may resume in early June.</p>

<p>Weekly Forum</p>
<h3>Several Perspectives on the Northeast Problem</h3>
<p>— Jiang Junzhang</p>
<p>(I) Introduction</p>
<p>The development of the Northeast problem has been truly tumultuous, causing us anxiety, fear, worry, and lament. We know that the Cairo Conference declaration affirmed our sovereignty in the Northeast, and the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance stipulated the specific methods for the Sino-Soviet handover of the Northeast after Japan's defeat. This was the time when the Northeast problem turned from darkness to light. However, since last September, the Communist army gained the advantage of entering the Northeast before the National army, and the Soviet army's withdrawal was repeatedly postponed, so the Northeast problem, which had initially seen a glimmer of hope, was once again shrouded in darkness. When the Soviet army withdrew from Changchun, the Communist army occupied key strongholds such as Changchun and Harbin, and established "regimes," the Northeast problem entered a more critical juncture. Now that the National army has recovered Changchun and continues to advance north, as long as the Communist Party can see the general trend and recognize that the country needs unification at this time, and voluntarily abandons its attempt to divide and occupy Harbin, Qiqihar, and the areas along the Chinese Changchun Railway, the Northeast problem may still see the light again.</p>
<p>The author believes that the crux of the Northeast problem can be divided into two parts: internal difficulties and external difficulties. If it were only internal difficulties or only external difficulties, the solution would be easier. Unfortunately, the Northeast problem is a difficult and complex case of internal and external interaction. Under mutual influence, it has become deeply entrenched. If the Communist Party has not abandoned the delusion of using external forces to divide and occupy territory, it will inevitably deviate from the path of solutions that are beneficial to the country and the nation, and go further and further away. The author, with a clear understanding of the importance of the Northeast problem, will conduct a concise review of the nature of the Northeast problem from the perspectives of the world situation, China's future, and the goals of the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p>(II) Viewing the Northeast Problem from an International Perspective</p>
<p>The Northeast problem is not simply a problem between China and the Soviet Union, but a major part of the entire world peace problem. Especially under the Soviet Union's current national policy, we are even more convinced that the Northeast problem is inherently international. What is the Soviet Union's current national policy? The Soviet authorities have not announced it to the world. However, many facts may help us understand it.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's west was originally shrunk to the eastern end of Finland. During the German-Polish war, the Soviet Union annexed Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and eastern Poland. The current Polish government, whose predecessor was the Polish Committee of National Liberation under the Soviet Union's wing, naturally follows the Soviet Union's policies closely; Poland's territory may expand to eastern Germany in the future. To the southwest, the Soviet Union has taken Czechoslovakia into its control and placed Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Yugoslavia under its wing. Austria in Central Europe is already a must-have for the Soviet Union, and Greece at the southern end of the Balkans and Turkey, which spans Europe and Asia and controls the gateway to the Black Sea, have also become areas of concentrated attention for the Soviet Union. To the south, there is the Iranian problem. Did Iran not contribute to the Soviet Union's fight against Germany, and did it not jointly issue a declaration with Britain and the United States after the Tehran Conference respecting its sovereignty and independence? However, although the Soviet army has reluctantly withdrawn, anti-national autonomous movements have occurred in the Soviet army's defense zone and have not been clarified until now. Looking at our Xinjiang, Mongolia, and Northeast to the southeast, Mongolia has broken away from our motherland for more than twenty years under the stationing of Soviet troops, and now it has achieved independence through the exchange of notes in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. The Yili Incident in Xinjiang has created a situation for China that is the same as the situation created for Iran by the Azerbaijan autonomous movement. As for the Northeast problem, allowing the Communist troops to gain the convenience of entering, and creating the month-long war in the Northeast, whether there will be other developments in the future, cannot be predicted at this time.</p>
<p>From the above, we can see that a part of the Soviet Union's post-war national policy is:</p>
<p>First, to expand its borders. This border, according to the current situation, has already reached the extent of the Tsarist era in the west; in the east, Soviet leaders have also clearly put forward the demand to restore the rights of the Tsarist era, and in fact they have achieved it to a considerable extent; in Iran, Tsarist Russia and Britain delineated spheres of influence, and Britain and Russia jointly invaded Iran during the First World War. The Azerbaijan incident seems to be a further step; in the Balkans, the policy of Tsarist Russia's pan-Slavism has been realized, which can be said to be a superior achievement.</p>
<p>Second, the Soviet Union's method of expanding its borders can be divided into the following types: one is to merge into the Soviet Union's territory or organize socialist republics to join the Soviet Union; the second is to establish pro-Soviet governments, making them foreign elements of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia is an example; the third is to establish Communist Party regimes, creating a situation of division and occupation of neighboring countries, so that the Soviet Union's neighbors no longer have unified and powerful countries.</p>
<p>Third, the Soviet Union's common methods of creating pro-Soviet regimes or Communist Party regimes are to develop the Communist Party or similar organizations during the period of stationing troops, and its appeals are either democratic or nationalistic, depending on the local environment.</p>
<p>After we understand the above international situation and a part of the Soviet Union's national policy, we can know that the occurrence and development of the Northeast problem has its background of the times and is inseparable from the Soviet Union's national policy. In short, the Soviet Union is implementing the establishment of pro-Soviet or communist outer-defense regimes, to make its neighboring countries become easily controlled weak countries or small countries. The national policy promoted by our Chinese government is to be friendly with the Soviet Union and the United States, and to try to get the United States and the Soviet Union to approach and be friendly because of China's mediation. Especially in economic development, China's help to foreign countries, whether it is the United States or the Soviet Union, is welcomed without discrimination. China's construction is about its own prosperity, happiness, and the guarantee of independent and autonomous rights and interests. Therefore, the policies that China implements internally and externally, in the Soviet Union's view, may be somewhat different from the policies implemented by the Soviet Union, especially as China approaches the United States, which makes the Soviet Union suspect that a future powerful China may give the Soviet Union a major disadvantage, thus strengthening the implementation of its original policies. The Soviet Union's various actions in the Northeast, and the Communist Party's mess in the Northeast, were brewed in this kind of imagination.</p>
<p>(III) Viewing the Northeast Problem from the Perspective of the Chinese Communist Party</p>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party is a key player in the development of the Northeast problem, so we should pay attention to how the Communist Party views the Northeast problem. To understand the Communist Party's views, we must first understand the following points:</p>
<p>First, the Chinese Communist Party is a political party that calls itself Marxism-Leninism. The characteristic of this doctrine in political activities is to seize power by means of armed rebellion, and to create a socialist country by means of one-party dictatorship. This socialist country has a motherland, and it is a sacred duty to obey the orders of the socialist motherland. Since the Chinese Communist Party is a Marxist-Leninist party, it naturally has these characteristics. Another point is that the Marxist-Leninist party calls itself the most progressive party, and the socialist country is also called the newest type of democratic country. Because of this, they always look at people with a bit of distrust and discrimination, and suspicion seems to have become their nature. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to talk about credibility with the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p>Second, since the Chinese Communist Party is a Marxist-Leninist party and has the sacred duty to obey the orders of the socialist motherland, the Chinese Communist Party views the Northeast problem, rather than standing on the market of China's interests, it can be said that it stands on the position of the Soviet Union's interests. In fact, the Chinese Communist Party cannot but do so, because if the Chinese Communist Party replaces the position of the socialist motherland with the position of the nation and the country, it will immediately lose the Soviet Union's trust. On the other hand, if the National Government can accommodate the Soviet Union's interests in planning the Northeast problem, then the Soviet Union may give the convenience given to the Chinese Communist Party to the National Government.</p>
<p>Third, since the Chinese Communist Party has consistently taken armed rebellion to seize power as its central proposition, so-called peace, so-called consultation, etc., are naturally just temporary gestures. The favorable conditions in the Communist Party's mind are national chaos, people's unrest, and terror everywhere, rather than stability and prosperity. This point coincides with a part of the Soviet Union's current national policy. Here, we can understand the Communist Party's confidential order of "continuous conflict, continuous negotiations." China has gone through more than eight years of war against Japan, and people are tired of chaos and eager to live and work in peace and unity. This is a major trend that cannot be violated. However, this major trend is exactly the opposite of the Communist Party's favorable conditions. How to use this opposite trend to make it a factor that is beneficial to the Communist Party? The Communist Party's method is this: when Japan first surrendered, on the one hand, it competed with the government for the right to accept the surrender, and on the other hand, it issued seven orders to attack large cities, transportation centers, and transportation lines. Under the name of uprising, restoration, and liberation, it expanded the occupied areas, creating a basis for the preparation of civil war. At the same time, it put forward slogans such as anti-civil war and peace movement, and even negotiated a truce, ostensibly seeking peace, but in fact to protect its occupied areas. But resolutions are resolutions, actions are actions, and after the resolution, the propaganda must do its best to exaggerate the other party's destruction of the resolution, in order to launch another attack, so that people in the country will not suspect that they are opposing peace and obstructing unification.</p>
<p>Fourth, as far as the Chinese Communist Party itself is concerned, from the Xianggan Uprising, the establishment of the Soviet in southern Jiangxi, to the 25,000-mile Long March to the Yan'an area in northern Shaanxi, they were all in the interior, and they were all far away from the socialist motherland. In other words, they were all fighting alone in barren land, and development was very difficult. Therefore, after the Chinese Communist Party captured Zhangjiakou, it had a tendency to abandon Yan'an and move its center to Zhangyuan. The Northeast has a large population and abundant resources, and it is adjacent to the socialist motherland on three sides, so it is naturally an ideal base for the Chinese Communist Party. During the period when the Japanese occupied the Northeast, the Communist troops could not get in, which was a major regret for the Communist Party. This time, under the wing of the Soviet army, the Communist Party divided and occupied the cities of the Northeast. What is missing is a legal issue. Therefore, the Communist Party and its foreign elements put forward the slogan that the Northeast problem must be resolved through consultation, on the one hand, making the most of the opportunity to create ready-made facts, and on the other hand, doing its best to publicize and shirk responsibility on the other party. When a negotiated solution cannot be obtained, it does not hesitate to use force, and uses a full-scale civil war as a backing. This shows that the Communist Party regards the Northeast as something in its pocket.</p>
<p>We must pay attention to the facts of the development of the Northeast problem. The government, based on the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and its annexes, requested the withdrawal of troops and the establishment of government agencies, and after many compromises and negotiations, it obtained some results, and the withdrawal of the Soviet army took so much back and forth and wasted so much time to realize a part of it. Therefore, whether the Communist Party abandons its attempt to divide and occupy the Northeast is a major key to the domestic peace problem in the future. (Continued on page 3)</p>

<h3>Conflict Between French and Vietnamese Troops in Hanoi; Establishment of the Republic of Cochinchina; Siam Reports Facts of French Troops Crossing the Border to the United Nations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] London, 1st Broadcast: Two wars broke out in the Far East today. French and Vietnamese troops in Hanoi have once again clashed, with casualties on both sides. The Siam-Vietnam border has been quiet. The French authorities are exaggerating war reports. In East India, there were also serious conflicts today, with sixty Indians killed or injured.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] London, 1st Broadcast: The French Commissioner in Cochinchina, Mr. Sédille, declared: "An independent Republic of Cochinchina has been proclaimed within the Vietnamese Federation of the French Republic." He stated: The first task of the new republic is to organize a plebiscite to decide whether to join the Viet Minh Free State formed by members of the Annam Nationalist Party of Hanoi. The Viet Minh State has been recognized by France in March as an independent republic under the Vietnamese Federation of the French Republic, while Cochinchina has been under direct French colonial rule for eighty-four years.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 31st Dispatch] The Siamese government today notified the United Nations organization that the government is prepared to accept all the constraints stipulated in the United Nations Charter. At the same time, it once again notified the United Nations Secretary-General Lie, recounting the relationship between Siam and France and accusing the various incidents that have occurred along the Mekong River since last year. The various incidents are as follows: (1) France arrested Siamese overseas Chinese and used rifles and machine guns to attack the Mekong River bank on the Siamese side.

As for other border disputes between Siam and France, the government plans to negotiate peacefully.</p>
<h3>Yoshida Shigeru and Our Newspaper Correspondent Discuss Domestic Issues in Japan; Says There is No Place in the World for Japanese Immigrants; Admits Respect for Chairman Chiang's Kind Treatment of Prisoners of War</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tokyo Correspondent, 31st Dispatch] Since Prime Minister Yoshida Shigeru formed his cabinet, our newspaper's Tokyo correspondent made his first solo visit to the Prime Minister's official residence yesterday. It began at 3:00 PM and lasted for forty minutes, ending at 3:40 PM. Prime Minister Yoshida met with the reporter in his personal office, without any members of parliament, and spoke in English. He also allowed the reporter to take photos, etc. This was the first time because he usually dislikes meeting reporters, and he is especially unwelcome to photography reporters. During the conversation, Yoshida claimed: Some foreign reporters have criticized his reluctance to meet reporters, which is true because he personally dislikes publicity. As for the "so-called national crisis in Japan," Yoshida replied: He has only been in office for a short time and has not had enough time to study the serious problems he has seen. Regarding the food problem, he said: In the future, Japan must import soybeans from Northeast China, chestnuts from North China, pears, and glutinous rice from the Yangtze River Basin, while Japan will export agricultural tools to China. Then they talked about how to solve the problem of Japan's outward population expansion. He said that the Japanese may move into the South Pacific or some other area in the future. Yoshida told the reporter frankly: There is really no place in the world for the Japanese to move into. The only way is to make Japan highly industrialized. Then he raised the current political situation problem. He said that he had no preparation to become Prime Minister in advance. It is well known that he is now planning to resign and let the capable take over, but no one is willing to take over the position of Prime Minister. He also said: He expressed great admiration for Chairman Chiang's speech to the Chinese people forgetting the past and treating the Japanese who were disarmed kindly. Yoshida also said that when he visited Shanghai in 1932, he had talked with his old friend Mr. Huang Guoguang about some methods to promote new relations between China and Japan, and asked him to convey them to the Chinese government for the sake of China and Japan. The result was good, but when he brought the plan back to Japan, it failed because the Prime Minister at the time was Admiral. He did not value the suggestions he made. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, he felt disappointed. The people of the two countries follow the same Confucian religion, so they should love each other like brothers. Regarding how to rebuild Japan, he said that if we want to rebuild Japan's industry, the first condition is to have sufficient food to feed the people, otherwise nothing can be done. Yoshida finally said: He likes the Chinese people very much and hopes to convey to your country people his gratitude to your country people through your newspaper and forgive our past mistakes.</p>
<h3>Japanese People Rush to Withdraw Savings; Bank Accounts are Limited</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 1st Dispatch] Japanese people fear that the government may freeze citizens' savings after the weekend as a tighter measure to suppress inflation, so they are rushing to withdraw their maximum savings from banks. In front of the gates of banks and post offices in Tokyo, there are long lines of nervous people. The new Minister of Finance, Ishibashi Tanzan, publicly denied that the government intended to take this action. The amount of currency issued by the Bank of Japan has been reduced to 15.2 billion yen. In the past thirty days, due to food shortages and rising prices of daily necessities, another 5 billion yen has been issued. Officials believe that if it continues to expand, there is a danger that the amount of issuance will reach 60 billion yen in August.</p>
<h3>The Emperor of Japan Visits MacArthur; Content of the Talks Speculated; Abdication May Have Been Mentioned</h3>

<h3>Far East International Military Tribunal to Resume Trial of Japanese War Criminals Tomorrow Morning; New American Lawyers Hired to Defend Tojo and Others</h3>
<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 1st Dispatch] According to the announcement of MacArthur's Headquarters: The Far East International Tribunal will resume trial at 9:30 AM on the 3rd, so the six motions filed by the defense lawyers (four of which were filed by American defense lawyers) and the four motions of the prosecutors can be publicly stated on that day. However, on the other hand, it is believed that the court will take several days to review the motions of both the defense lawyers and the prosecutors, so the defense lawyers' request to postpone the reopening for a week will be realized. The American defense lawyers have basically arrived to prepare for the trial, and they have been gathering in the court to discuss defense methods in recent days. Among the newly arrived American defense lawyers, Gaeta, who is responsible for Tojo's defense, is well-known in the United States for his debating skills, and is expected to have fierce debates with the prosecutors. Van Lunn, a lieutenant colonel, is the defense lawyer for Doihara, and Van Ness, a major, is the defense lawyer for Shigemitsu.</p>

<h3>British Scientists Suggest the United Nations Should Internationally Control Atomic Energy</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 31st Dispatch] The British Atomic Scientists Association has issued a memorandum, preparing to submit it to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. The memorandum recommends abolishing the existing regulations on atomic secrecy, disclosing basic scientific information, and allowing free and open research on atomic energy, but the main results should be reported to the United Nations organization. Atomic energy should be internationally controlled, and the United Nations should appoint investigators who have the right to investigate in any country to prohibit them from going beyond the scope approved by the United Nations and engaging in the manufacture of atomic energy. The raw materials of atomic energy should also be managed and operated by the United Nations. The Atomic Energy Commission should establish large-scale factories to manufacture atomic raw materials. These factories should be distributed all over the world to achieve balance. Bombs and explosives should be directly controlled by the United Nations. The final goal is to completely abolish the manufacture of these items. American Deputy Secretary of State Acheson issued a report from the Atomic Energy Commission appointed by the State Department in March, classifying atomic energy activities into "safe" and "dangerous" categories. This suggestion is quite approved by our association. We believe that all countries will be able to cooperate and establish a new environment of trust, and conduct joint research to reduce the danger of war.</p>

<h3>US Maritime Workers' Strike Prospects Dim, Truman Issues Warning: Will Order Navy Mobilization If Strike Occurs</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 1st: President Truman broadcasted from here today, departing Washington for Claremont to receive an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Washington University.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 31st] President Truman today took another direct step to address the serious national labor unrest issue. He warned that if the national maritime workers proceed with their planned strike on June 15th, he will order the Navy, Coast Guard, and the then-existing Maritime Commission to take over national merchant ships to ensure continued navigation. The maritime workers' strike action could paralyze all transportation between the United States and the Far East, but the prospects for averting the labor unrest are dim. Amidst negotiations to curb the labor unrest, seven major maritime labor unions suddenly raised demands for increased wages and related working hours. They are requesting a 40-hour work week with wages of $0.22 to $0.35 per hour.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington, 1st] Maritime union leaders and ship owners, amidst an atmosphere of hostility and pessimism, agreed to continue negotiations today to seek to avoid the maritime workers' strike on June 15th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington, 1st, United Press] The Senate has passed President Truman's emergency labor control bill, but refused to authorize the president to conscript workers who strike against the government or to disqualify them. The bill stipulates.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Cooperates with the Three Powers on German and Austrian Transportation Issues</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 31st] The Soviet Union and the other three powers seem to have abandoned their uncooperative attitude on transportation and technical issues in Germany and Austria. This change is a symbol of improved relations between the non-Soviet powers. This is evidenced by two things: first, the Soviet Union agreed to the British, American, and French proposal to establish a Central European Railway Vehicle Exchange Bureau in Vienna, covering Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Austria, and the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, which will greatly facilitate the flow of goods within Central Europe and between Central and Western Europe; second, the Soviet Union allowed Austria to participate in the Central European Inland Transport Office. Austria is the center of Central European water and land transportation, and it is expected to greatly benefit the recovery of the European economy.</p>

Upon arriving in Britain, he will discuss with Foreign Secretary Bevin the issue of completing Austria's independence and democracy.</p>
<h3>Two Knots in the British Transportation Line to the Far East: Egypt and Palestine (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper's London Special Correspondent Xueyan</p>
<p>Appeasing the Arabs Offends the Jews</p>
<p>Looking east from Egypt, across the Red Sea, is Palestine. Palestine is a legacy inherited by Britain after the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire in World War I, entrusted to Britain by the League of Nations under a mandate, and is now also a field of controversy. As early as 1917, before the end of the European War, when this land was under British rule and the legal status was undecided, Britain was already interested in this land. Foreign Secretary Balfour issued the famous Balfour Declaration, saying that he would take this land to settle displaced Jews and turn it into a Jewish national homeland. But at the same time, it was also declared that the principle was not to harm the interests of the original inhabitants. This resounding declaration won a lot of praise. As a result, the League of Nations entrusted Britain to govern this land according to this principle. But strangely enough, although the Balfour Declaration was concise and resounding, it was extremely difficult to implement. Appeasing the Arabs who live there offends the Jews. The opposite is also true. The two are mutually incompatible and have never been reconciled. In addition, the gradual popularization of Arab nationalism and the increasing number of Jewish immigrants have led to constant conflict. Although Britain has sent several investigation teams to seek a compromise solution for both parties, the results have never been satisfactory. Superficial peace relies on armed forces to suppress it. Until the end of last year, the British government, with the consent of the United States, sent another joint British-American investigation team to investigate the truth, with a deadline of 120 days to submit a report and suggestions for the two governments to refer to and adopt. British Foreign Secretary Bevin even said when announcing this policy that he was willing to bet his political future on its success, which shows his great confidence.</p>
<p>Investigation Team's Recommendations</p>
<p>Cannot Break the Difficult Deadlock</p>
<p>After this policy was announced, the members of the investigation team immediately determined the organization and began work. Before the deadline arrived, the report had already been submitted, and it contained ten suggestions that were quite contrary to Britain's current policy. After a week of research by the British government, Prime Minister Attlee submitted the report to the House of Commons, saying that he would not criticize it until he had fully consulted the opinion of the US government. He also hinted that if the British government wanted to adopt the ten recommendations in the report, it would adopt them all, otherwise it would not consider any one part of them. But the opinion of the US government seemed to be just the opposite. After studying it, US President Truman issued a criticism, only pointing out one point that the US government has always supported, saying it was very good, but did not say a word of support for the other points in the recommendation. At the same time, when the investigation team was working, the Jews opposed it very strongly. The British government sent a large army to Palestine to suppress it, and as a result, terrorist incidents launched by Jews often occurred. After this report was released, the Jews silently recognized it after studying it. On the contrary, the Arabs were quite quiet during the investigation process, but after the report was released, they immediately indicated that it was inappropriate and had issued a warning of their determination to oppose it. The content of the report was slightly biased towards the Jews. If it is implemented in the future, the resistance and disturbances of the Jews may be expected to calm down, and the rebellion of the Arabs will definitely replace it. On the contrary, if it is shelved and there is no other better new method, then the unrest initiated by the Jews in Palestine now will still be unable to relax. The United States is concerned about the future of the Jews because there are many Jews in the United States. On the contrary, Britain has many Arabs under its rule, so it must take into account the resistance of the Arabs. The recommendations of this investigation team are unlikely to break this difficult deadlock, and they also expose the differences in opinion between Britain and the United States in this regard.</p>
<p>Determine the Goal First</p>
<p>Two Ethnic Groups Rise to Equality</p>
<p>As for the ten recommendations of the investigation team, in summary, they can be briefly described as follows: The lives of Jews in various parts of Europe who have been poisoned by the Nazis are very miserable. All countries in the world should open their immigration doors and allow Jews to immigrate. Palestine is the place that Jews are most willing to go to, and they should be allowed to immigrate. However, Palestine alone cannot accommodate so many Jews, so it must be shared by various countries. Before various issues are agreed upon, 100,000 people should be allowed to immigrate to Palestine within one year. After these 100,000 people immigrate, Palestine will continue to be opened, and the number of people immigrating each year should be determined according to production capacity. In view of the mutual incompatibility between the local Arabs and Jews, Palestine cannot be allowed to be independent for the time being, and the mandatory governing country should continue to assume responsibility, and later be governed under the United Nations trusteeship. And first determine the goal, neither to make it an Arab country nor to make it a Jewish country, but a country where the two ethnic groups coexist and prosper. At the same time, Palestine should strive to develop its resources and build water conservancy projects so that it can support the ever-increasing population. In addition, it is necessary to find ways to improve the living and education standards of the Arabs, so that they are equal to the Jews, so that the two ethnic groups can achieve true equality and there is no need to be suspicious of each other.</p>
<p>Although there are many lofty and ambitious plans in this construction. But those that are lofty and ambitious are inevitably long-term and have a bleak future, and are impractical. On the contrary, the point of immigrating Jews is very concrete and can be seen immediately, and the 100,000 people immigrating within one year must be handled immediately. We know that Palestine is a small place and its production is not very good, and it can only accommodate at most more than 2 million people. Now there is a population of about 1.8 million, and the number of Arabs and Jews is almost equal. Not to mention the continued immigration in the future, just these 100,000 people squeezed in already feel a great weight. Arabs oppose this. Secondly, the Arabs now demand independence, and the suggestion says that it is not allowed, which is naturally one of the reasons for opposition. On the contrary, improving education and living standards is quite empty talk, and the saying that the two ethnic groups coexist and prosper is even more unguaranteed. Once the Jews occupy the majority, it will be difficult for the Arabs to hope for equality again. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Arabs oppose this suggestion. (End)</p>
<h3>Several Views on the Northeast Problem: Continued from Page 2, Weekly Review</h3>
<p>(4) Looking at the Northeast from China</p>
<p>We Chinese ourselves have a unified view on the Northeast issue. That is, the Northeast is our Chinese territory and the lifeline of the Chinese people. The purpose of our eight-year War of Resistance was to recover the Northeast. Our recovery of the Northeast has long been agreed upon by the Allied nations. Even the Soviet Union has given us a clear stipulation in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. In terms of law, we already have sufficient grounds, but the evolution of the facts has led to such chaos. We are truly filled with emotion. Our patience is limited, and we are already inexpressibly grief-stricken.</p>
<p>We Chinese people deeply understand that the Northeast and our North China are interdependent and share the same fate. Our Chinese history fully proves this relationship. Not to mention the distant past, just take the Song and Ming dynasties as examples. The Khitans, the Liao, and the Jin all rose in the Northeast. The Song dynasty was always in a state of temporary peace. After the Qing dynasty rose in Jianzhou, the Ming dynasty was always exhausted by the defense of Liaodong, and ultimately perished because of this. Looking again at the period after September 18th, when the Northeast was in the hands of the Japanese, our North China was even more insecure and in a precarious situation. Therefore, we Chinese people firmly demand that the special status of the Northeast not be allowed to exist and that the Northeast must be unified under the central government of the country. We cannot tolerate the situation after the victory of the War of Resistance repeating itself today. We cannot bear to imagine what the ending of the Song and Ming dynasties was like? We are even more reluctant to recall what the ending after September 18th was like? Therefore, we must take precautions and eliminate all evil causes to avoid the recurrence of evil consequences.</p>
<p>We also understand that high-altitude areas are important for air transportation and national defense surveillance. Former US Vice President Wallace once visited our wartime capital. His journey passed through Xinjiang. He said, "I came from the front door of China." In fact, we have two front doors: one is Xinjiang, and the other is the Northeast. In terms of Sino-US air traffic, the front door is actually the Northeast, while Xinjiang is still a side door. The northward shift of China's external military focus is an inevitable result of the air age. The relationship between this gateway and our national defense will become closer with the progress of the times. We Chinese people will also have to redouble our efforts to maintain our ownership of this gateway because of the mission of the times!</p>
<p>Finally, we have a deeper understanding of this, which is recognized from the vicissitudes of the Northeast's international relations. We know that the Northeast in the late Qing Dynasty became a battleground for Japan and Russia. The ebb and flow of the two countries' power once evolved into the tragedy of the Russo-Japanese War. After September 18th, Japan exclusively occupied the Northeast. Shidehara said, "It's like watching a bomb," and it eventually evolved into World War II. When we investigate the reasons, in a nutshell, it is because China's national power declined and power was lost. The current situation in the Northeast, coupled with the gunpowder atmosphere in the international community, may very well lead to World War III. We Chinese people absolutely love peace and deeply know that war will only destroy China. Therefore, we are extremely unwilling for the Northeast issue to not have a reasonable solution. Now, to be honest, the various disagreements between the United States and the Soviet Union will inevitably affect our China. Especially the differences of opinion on the Korean issue have a greater impact on our Northeast issue and a greater threat to world peace. If a special regime with the nature of a Soviet periphery is established in the Northeast, it will be tantamount to a fatal blow to China's survival and a major threat to US security and world peace. Only by integrating the Northeast completely into China, under our unbiased national policy, can we reduce friction between the United States and the Soviet Union and gradually approach harmony, and jointly devote ourselves to building the foundation of world peace. This is another important task for us to maintain the Northeast.</p>
<p>(5) Conclusion</p>
<p>In summary, we can see that the Northeast issue is, on the one hand, the most important part of our domestic party issues. It can be said that it is the key to whether domestic peace can be maintained in the future. On the other hand, it is a corner of a complex international issue, and the maintenance of world peace in the future is also greatly affected by this.</p>
<p>Secondly, we must pay attention to the fact that China after the long-term War of Resistance must not have long-term chaos. Our people must use sharp eyes to distinguish who is trying to create long-term chaos. Our people must use calm minds to objectively examine national outlook, national sentiment, and socialist state positions, and see which one is most beneficial to us. We also ask the Chinese Communists to make the above considerations. We need an independent and autonomous country, we need an orderly society, we need construction and prosperity, and we need political parties to not forget that they are organized by Chinese people.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for the sake of the survival of the country, for the sake of the people's lives, and for the sake of world peace, we demand that unnecessary international disputes should be avoided as much as possible, and we should take out sincerity to think about peace and happiness. The Northeast is a region where our life and death are at stake. China is a great power in name only. China's possession of the Northeast will never be a threat to world peace or infringe on the interests of any country. In fact, China does not currently have this ability, and even if it becomes a powerful country in the future, there will never be the above danger. This can be found in history and in the view of Chinese national character. There is no need for the Soviet Union to support another Communist regime on the Chinese border as its security guarantee.</p>
<p>Finally, we also have a sincere expectation for the Chinese Communist Party. First, the position of the socialist motherland, at least in China in the next few decades, cannot be called for, especially since it violates the spirit of Chinese national character and historical education, and this path will inevitably not work. Any clever means or ingenious propaganda, if this meaning is not considered, will inevitably lose faith in front of the Chinese people and only lose the country's vitality, sacrificing the strength of the CCP. Second, the concept of seizing power by force must be truly abandoned, and the right path of democratic countries must be followed, and power and ability must be won in the parliament with policies. If they continue to create chaos and disturbances in order to seize power, the result is that the goal is difficult to achieve, and the country is destroyed, the people are killed, and the CCP itself is also destroyed. If the CCP accepts this point of advice, then any problem is very easy to solve, and the Northeast problem will naturally no longer be a problem. Our people have the right to demand that the CCP accept our expectations. We must take out the strength of the masters to make it accept our demands!</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Convenes Industrial and Commercial Sectors to Discuss Resolving the Current Crisis; Minister Gu Attends and Announces Government Policies; Warns Vegetable and Meat Industries; Mayor Wu Will Not Tolerate Illegal Price Gouging</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Due to frequent labor unrest in the city's industrial and commercial sectors, coupled with a shortage of raw materials and high costs rendering them unable to compete with foreign goods, business has plummeted, pushing them to the brink of bankruptcy. In addition to taking various effective measures to prepare for a rescue, Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang recently came to Shanghai from Nanjing to announce the government's policies for handling labor unrest to those in charge of various labor unions, strictly prohibiting illegal strikes and slowdowns. Mr. Gu came to Shanghai again yesterday morning to attend a discussion meeting convened by the Social Affairs Bureau in the afternoon with those in charge of various trade associations. Mayor Wu also attended and delivered a speech. Attendees included Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, Special Commissioner Lu Jingshi of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Director Zhao Banfu of the Labor Affairs Office of the Social Affairs Bureau, Chairman Wang Xiaolai of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and over two hundred representatives from various trade associations. After the formalities, Chairman Wu Kaixian explained the significance of the meeting, stating that everyone is deeply concerned about the current industrial and commercial crisis. Minister Gu had already convened those in charge of various labor unions to give instructions. Solving the current problem requires not only workers to take responsibility and obey order, but also the industrial and commercial sectors to cooperate with the government's policies to help resolve this crisis.</p>
<p>Following this, Mayor Wu delivered a speech, stating: Shanghai is the commercial center of the country, with imports and exports accounting for nearly ninety percent of the total. Therefore, Shanghai's prosperity or decline has a significant impact on the entire country. Assuming office as the Mayor of Shanghai, I feel a great responsibility, and it is my greatest responsibility to support industry and commerce and to resolve the current economic crisis. Tell me your suffering and dissatisfaction, brothers, and I will gradually improve things. I also hope that officials and the people can work together as one, and that there is no separation between the people and the government. He then stated several points to those present: (1) Promote frugality and hope that advanced industrial and commercial leaders will set an example, saving manpower, financial resources, and materials for national construction and production. (2) Suppress speculators and ask all sectors to assist in this. Violators will be severely punished. Grain prices have already begun to fall. The result of this grain registration is only over 400,000 dan. However, it is known that various firms registered at 60% of their actual reserves. The municipal government is not unaware of this, and has already investigated. In addition to detaining Wu Changmi and Rong Yongming again, over three thousand packages of unregistered grain from the Santai Company have been confiscated. The registration deadline is now extended to the evening of next Tuesday (June 4th). If you do not register after the deadline, you will be completely confiscated after being reported. (3) I warn the trade associations of the vegetable and fresh pork industries that the recent increase in the market price of vegetables and pork is even greater than that of rice, and decisive action will be taken to suppress this. If there is extortion, report it to the municipal government for severe punishment. In short, the prosperity or decline of Shanghai affects the whole country. It is my responsibility to eliminate violence, protect the good, increase production, and develop commerce. I will follow the central government's policies and implement them thoroughly, so that Shanghai can restore its former glory.</p>
<h3>Minister Gu Provides Detailed Explanation of the Policy for Handling Labor Unrest</h3>
<p>Minister Gu then spoke, first stating that he originally intended to invite Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu to come together, but Minister Wang was unable to attend due to various matters. Therefore, what he will say today is limited to matters within the scope of his ministry. Economic issues will be addressed by Minister Wang on another day. Minister Gu said that the government is determined to improve economic difficulties and support the proper development of industry and commerce. He explained the following key points regarding the government's handling policies and what the industrial and commercial sectors should understand: (A) Government labor policies and the policy for handling the current labor unrest: 1. The main spirit of the labor policy: (1) Support workers' organizations, improve workers' lives, and raise the status of labor. (2) Promote labor-management coordination, improve labor efficiency, and develop productive enterprises. 2. Policy for handling labor unrest: (1) Workers' legitimate interests should be protected. (2) Labor discipline must be rectified. (3) Labor-management disputes should be handled in accordance with legal procedures. 4. Adjustments to wages should be handled in accordance with the prescribed principles. (B) What national industrialists should understand: 1. To seek the development of productive enterprises, they should assist the government in stabilizing prices and suppressing speculation in order to stabilize social and production order. 2. Rescuing the industrial crisis requires not only eliminating labor unrest but also improving all production conditions. 3. Increasing production must pay attention to labor welfare. 4. Respect the personality, status, and legitimate rights and interests of labor. 5. Labor-management disputes should be handled in accordance with the law in order to achieve a reasonable solution. (C) Several points that are hoped the industrial and commercial sectors will achieve: 1. Improve the organization of industrial and commercial groups and help stabilize prices. 2. Formulate factory regulations in accordance with labor laws, submit them to the government for approval, and implement them conscientiously. 3. Implement factory meetings to promote labor-management cooperation. 4. Allow workers to legally form factories and should not have a discriminatory attitude towards labor unions. 5. Quickly develop welfare undertakings to improve workers' lives and increase work efficiency. 6. , salaries should be handled in accordance with the prescribed procedures. 7. Without government approval, do not suspend or close factories without reason. 8. Fully trust and obey the government and handle labor-management disputes in accordance with the law. 9. Colleagues should not poach workers from each other or increase wages without authorization.</p>
<h3>Stabilizing Prices Requires Cooperation</h3>
<p>Mr. Gu stated: Stabilizing prices cannot be achieved by individual strength or government laws alone, but relies on the understanding and cooperative efforts of colleagues to be effective. The laws and policies stipulated by the government are not intended to give special protection to a certain class, but are determined in consideration of the comprehensive interests and needs of all parties. The government's policy is the people's demand, so it will never be biased towards one side. Labor welfare and production efficiency are closely related, so capital should develop labor welfare as much as possible. Mr. Gu also emphasized that today's criteria for judging someone are not based on wealth or official rank, but on their contribution to humanity. Therefore, capital should respect the status of labor because labor-management cooperation comes from mutual respect and love. Regarding labor union organizations, Minister Gu used a precious knife as a metaphor: it can be used to kill people or to protect people, it all depends on how it is used. Therefore, labor unions are not necessarily bad, as long as they are properly led, they can be very helpful to production. Therefore, capital does not need to be afraid of them, and if you want workers to obey discipline, and want the government to maintain production discipline, there are many considerations that capital must improve. In short, past individual efforts have failed, and in the future we should cooperate together to resolve the current crisis. This is not for the benefit of any individual, but for the benefit of the entire nation.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Makes Conclusion and Announces Governance Policy</h3>
<p>Regarding the incident in which unemployed workers who came to Shanghai from the rear area took unauthorized action at the Social Affairs Bureau the other day, Minister Gu stated: Minister Bu sympathizes with the unemployed workers and also considers them to be contributors to the war effort, so he will handle the matter leniently, but labor discipline must be strictly enforced, and the government will strictly implement it. Finally, Mayor Wu made a conclusion, announcing three governance policies: (1) Maintain and protect legitimate industry and commerce to encourage production. (2) Suppress speculation and stabilize prices. (3) Promote frugality to enrich the country and promote prosperity.</p>
<p>At this time, representatives from the handkerchief and silk weaving industries stood up one after another and appealed to Minister Gu, Mayor Wu, and others, expressing the heavy burden of current interest rates, the arrogance of workers, and the inability to maintain business, forcing them to the brink of bankruptcy, and various other crises. Luo Qinghua, representing the industrial and commercial sectors, described the difficulties of each industry, hoping that the party authorities would provide practical assistance and relief at this critical juncture of survival, and asked Minister Gu to appeal to the central government to take effective measures. There were many speakers following this, but because Minister Gu was busy with official duties, Wang Xiaolai announced that if there were any opinions, they could be submitted to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for forwarding to Minister Gu for review, and the meeting adjourned at around six o'clock.</p>
<h3>Travel Industry Complains; Price Limits Mean Inability to Maintain Operations; Traveler Burden Increases Rather Than Decreases</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 7:00 PM, the Commercial Trade Association of the travel industry in the city held a reception for news reporters at Xinghualou Restaurant. During the reception, Xu Wenzhao, Sun Qiubing, Chen Songtao, and others in charge of the association successively described the difficulties faced by the industry. Their main points were: (1) Since the implementation of price limits, the impact of fluctuations has made it impossible to balance income and expenditure, resulting in heavy losses and leading to labor loan disputes. If this is not urgently improved, it will be impossible to maintain operations and will lead to total collapse. (2) Labor and management should help each other, otherwise, capital will be unable to operate. The reason for the inability of labor and management to coordinate is caused by price limits. (3) After the implementation of price limits, travel agencies had to increase room rates to compensate for expenses. The tip is a reward given by the customer to acknowledge good service and is given voluntarily, therefore, the burden on travelers actually increases rather than decreases. The association is currently submitting a report to relevant agencies such as the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting a return to the original state in order to survive.</p>
<h3>Seventeen Movie Theaters Implement Reserved Seating</h3>
<p>The seventeen first and second-run movie theaters in the city, including the Grand Theater, have followed the order of the Police Bureau and implemented reserved seating for all shows starting yesterday.

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Denies Buying Sassoon House; Claims He Has No Money to Buy a House</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Kong Xiangxi, Chairman of the Bank of China, denied buying Sassoon House and other properties at a mayoral reception yesterday. Mr. Kong told reporters: "I simply have no money to buy a house. Even if I had property, I would invest it in businesses, not buy houses." Regarding the issue of labor unrest in the city, Mr. Kong believes that there cannot be labor unrest in China at present. The issue of labor unrest should be handled with consideration for both labor and management. China's industry is backward at present, and we should immediately develop industry and increase production. If the reduction in domestic production is due to the lower prices of imported goods, it is a major crisis. Also, Mr. Kong is quite willing to travel more within the country in the future, and plans to stay in his hometown of Shanxi for a while, but the date has not yet been decided.</p>
<h3>A Mine Exploded in the Wusong River; Houses in the Entire Town Shook Violently</h3>
<p>At around 3:30 PM yesterday, a wooden box floated in the Huangpu River in Wusong and was discovered by a nearby small sailboat, which immediately went to retrieve it. At that time, various sampans also went there, thinking that there must be valuables hidden in the box, and they scrambled to grab it. When they opened the wooden box to inspect it, it suddenly exploded with a bang. White waves flew into the sky in the Huangpu River, and blood splattered everywhere. Houses throughout the entire town of Wusong were violently shaken. Upon hearing the alarm, the water and land authorities immediately mobilized and announced special martial law. According to a reporter's investigation, it was learned that the wooden box that was retrieved contained a mine. When it was hit and exploded, several sampans were shattered to pieces. More than twenty people, large and small, were killed, all with dismembered limbs, a gruesome sight. Forty to fifty people were injured. After local clinics bandaged their wounds, they were sent to various hospitals in Shanghai for treatment by car.</p>

After performing the rituals, Commander Li first delivered a farewell speech, expressing his gratitude for the assistance of his colleagues in the past, and hoping that under the guidance of the new commander, they would work hard at their posts in the future. Then, the newly appointed Commander Xuan delivered a speech, instructing his subordinates on two points: (1) Understand their own mission; (2) Pay attention to military discipline and set an example. The ceremony ended at 10:00 AM. After Commander Li was sent off by Mr. Xuan, he met visiting guests in the commander's office, including Mayor Wu, Director of the Land Administration Bureau Zhu Ping, Xu Jiqing, Wang Zhuyi, Rong Youlue, and others. Mr. Xuan met with reporters from various newspapers yesterday and said that because the new order for reorganization of his headquarters had not yet arrived, everything would remain in its original position and there would be no changes in personnel. In the future, after the reorganization, it might be reduced to four departments: Staff, Adjutant, Military Law, and Inspectorate. The Special Service Regiment, which originally belonged to the headquarters, had been ordered to reduce its scale to one battalion.

<h3>Tao Yishan Heads Inspectorate</h3>
<p>Assumed office yesterday following Commander Xuan</p>
<p>Cui Yuming, Director of the Inspectorate of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, has been promoted to Director of the Guangzhou Police Bureau. The vacancy of Director of the Inspectorate has been filled by Tao Yishan. Before the war, Mr. Tao served as the Captain of the Civic Training Corps in Shanghai, and nearly 20,000 people participated in the training. After the August 13th Incident, he participated in the battle under Wang Jingjiu's command. Finally, he was appointed by the Chairman to take charge of defending Nanshi. After leaving Shanghai, he first fought in western Zhejiang. From 1939 to 1942, he served as the Director of the Inspectorate of the Chongqing Garrison Headquarters. Later, he was transferred to the Anti-Smuggling Bureau and worked with Commander Xuan. In 1943, the Sino-American Cooperative Organization of the Military Commission was established, and he was responsible for the preparation. By 1944, he and the Americans had trained and equipped troops in various provinces of central China. Because of his excellent performance, he was promoted to Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Special Operations Army of the Military Commission and concurrently served as the Commander-in-Chief of Central China, commanding the army and the Sino-American mixed forces to fight against the enemy in Hankou. During the Battle of western Hunan, he made outstanding military achievements. Chief of Staff He and General MacArthur, the American Theater Commander, personally came to western Hunan to award medals. After the victory, he participated in the surrender of Changsha and Hankou. Subsequently, he was transferred to work on the Yuehan and Pinghan lines. This time, Commander Xuan was promoted and specially transferred him to Shanghai to serve as Director of the Inspectorate. Returning to his old place, he is familiar with the situation and will surely make contributions to Shanghai's public security.</p>
<h3>High Court Retries Xu Liquan; Laborers Yin Yuson Yunzhang Set to Be Sentenced on the 8th</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Xu Liquan, the bogus acting president of the Chinese Daily, was interrogated again yesterday. Xu wore a black long gown, yellow leather shoes, had a shaved head, and wore glasses. He confessed to serving as the bogus acting president of the Chinese Daily, but denied being a confidant of Lin Bisheng. As for participating in the "Greater East Asia Writers' Conference" in Tokyo, he said that he stayed in Tokyo for two days and did not discuss any issues, and claimed: "This is just the enemy's ridiculous trick, wanting to bring representatives from the occupied areas of China and Southeast Asia to Tokyo to show co-prosperity." After the interrogation, he was still detained. Also, Xue Qichou, station master of the Wusong Station Interrogation Station, Yan Zhongcheng, director of the bogus Suzhou Police Station, Pan Amao, a spy of the enemy Gendarmerie, and Qian Xiaomin, were all interrogated yesterday and ordered to be re-interrogated at a later date. In addition, Sun Yunwei, secretary of the bogus Zhejiang Provincial Government, and Lao Yinyu, director of the bogus Commodity Inspection Bureau, have been tried and their sentences will be announced on the 8th.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Zhang Yifeng, Wang Zhen, Ren Ke, Bi Jianbo, Xu Baoji, and others have been prosecuted by the High Procuratorate on suspicion of being traitors. Liu Deqin and Li Ding were not prosecuted. Also, the High Procuratorate did not prosecute Fan Shunxing on Pan Shirong's accusation of being a traitor, so Pan will go to Nanjing to accuse Fan Shun at the Supreme Court.</p>
<h3>Arch-traitor Liang Hongzhi; She Aizhen, who Assisted Her Husband in Evil Deeds; Both Male and Female Criminals Are Scheduled to Be Interrogated on the 5th</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The case of Liang Hongzhi, the leader of the puppet Reformed Government, has been scheduled for its first trial on the afternoon of the 5th of this month at 2:00 PM. It has been found that Liang is a native of Changle, 64 years old, residing at 150 Bixun Road. He successively held important positions in the three puppet organizations of the Nanjing "Reformed Government," the Beiping "Joint Committee of the Chinese Government," and the Nanjing "National Government." The High Procuratorate charged him with occupying the capital, usurping administrative orders, changing the national flag, recruiting troops, creating a confrontation with the central government, fueling the enemy's aggressive flames, shaking the military and civilian's will to resist, disregarding the interests of the country and the survival of the nation, and brazenly colluding with the enemy to betray the country. He is truly an arch-traitor and a heinous criminal, and has committed the crime of colluding with the enemy to plot against the country under Article 2, Item 1 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Traitors. On the same afternoon, She Aizhen, wife of the bogus special agent demon Wu Shibao, will be interrogated. It has been found that She is a native of Guangdong, 46 years old, residing at 7, Lane 349, Yuyuan Road. Here is an excerpt from the prosecutor's indictment: "The defendant Wu She Aizhen has confessed that Wu Shibao recruited accomplices, arrested underground workers of the central government, and killed employees of the Bank of China, but she does not admit that she manipulated and planned everything in Wu's illegal and reckless acts. However, according to the report of Shen Fenggang, director of the Second Division of the bogus Special Service Headquarters, "Wu Shibao is illiterate, and many things must be approved by Wu She Aizhen before they can be carried out," which proves that she did indeed do these things, and there is no need to deny it. She also confessed that she had been a long-time accountant for the guards of the bogus Special Service Headquarters, examined the thoughts and behaviors of the guards for Wu, participated in extrajudicial interrogations of so-called "political prisoners", protected gambling dens, and accepted subsidies, which are consistent with the descriptions in the Military Intelligence Department's records. The facts of the crime have been clearly established."</p>
<p>(Another report) Lin Kanghou has been scheduled for his first interrogation in the Criminal Division of the High Court at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 7th.</p>
<h3>Displaced and Suffering; Overseas Chinese Leader Huang Enshi Talks About His Experiences Upon Arriving in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Huang Enshi, a leader of the overseas Chinese community in Batavia, recently told reporters that order in the Dutch East Indies has not yet been restored. Currently, the British-Dutch Allied Forces, the Dutch government, and the Republican government are in charge of political affairs in various places, forming a situation of three rulers in one country. The war is frequent, and prices are soaring. The business of the one million overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies has completely stopped, and most of them are only relying on selling furniture to survive. They are displaced and suffering terribly. Currently, the Republican government is located in Solo in central Java, the original site of the Governor-General's Palace, while the Allied Forces have established their headquarters in Bandung. In Bandung, a railway runs across the city, dividing the city into north and south districts. The southern district is the central area of the overseas Chinese, and the northern district is the headquarters of the Allied Forces and also has an airfield. The prices in these two districts are extremely different. For example, in the southern district, an egg sells for two Dutch guilders, while in the northern district, it costs fifteen guilders. The current exchange rate is 2.6 guilders to one US dollar, so prices are actually much higher than in Shanghai. The searches between these two districts are very strict. In March and April, nearly 100 overseas Chinese disappeared. Five to six hundred overseas Chinese shops have closed their doors. The overseas Chinese have always been known for their hard work and endurance, but now their lives are becoming increasingly difficult.</p>
<h3>The Dutch Government Authorities Have Good Feelings Towards Our Country</h3>
<p>However, the Dutch government and the Republican government both have very good feelings towards China and greatly admire Chairman Chiang. They will bow and salute those Chinese residences displaying portraits of the Chairman. When the Japanese occupied the Dutch East Indies, they hung pictures of the four major leaders of the United Nations in the amusement park and allowed visitors to shoot arrows at the pictures for amusement, but no one ever took such action against the Chairman's portrait, not even the Malays. Later, the Japanese army finally took down the Chairman's portrait. During the occupation, there were such facts, which shows the respect and admiration of all people in the Dutch East Indies for the Chairman. Mr. Huang said that the current situation of war and disaster in the Dutch East Indies has plunged the people into deep water and fire. If our government sends senior officials to the Dutch East Indies, it will not only boost the morale of the overseas Chinese but also achieve great results in resolving the situation.</p>
<h3>Malays Speaking Chinese: A Source of Pride</h3>
<p>Within the Republican government, all agencies are titled in Chinese, such as "Department of Propaganda" and "Post Office," all using Chinese plaques. Among the indigenous people, many possess extremely elegant Chinese calligraphy skills. The mutual benefit government deeply admires Premier Nehru's advocacy for aiding weaker nations and jointly seeking national liberation. The Dutch government also declared that without China's eight years of heroic resistance, they would not have been able to return to the Dutch East Indies. Currently, Malays consider being able to speak fluent and beautiful Chinese a source of pride, reversing the previous trend of not understanding Chinese or recognizing Chinese characters. Mr. Huang's visit is intended to prepare for an airline company, opening a route from China to the Dutch East Indies, currently still under negotiation. Huang is currently the General Manager of Batavia Yuansheng Import Trading Company and concurrently a commissioner of the Guangdong Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Guidance Committee. He remained unyielding during the Dutch East Indies' fall, highly respected by overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<h3>Toyoda, Murakawa Transferred to Military Tribunal</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Toyoda, the president of the Japanese Residents Association who orchestrated underground work for the Japanese side, and Murakawa Shun, the former Japanese Deputy Consul-General in Shanghai, were transferred from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to the military tribunal in this district at 2 PM yesterday. It has been verified that Toyoda was employed by the Japanese Embassy and the Shanghai Consulate-General during the War of Resistance, responsible for intelligence work in the Shanghai area. Murakawa Shun was a resident of Yagito Village, Kitakawachi District, Osaka Prefecture, Japan, and a graduate of the Harbin Japanese War Association School. He came to China in August of the thirtieth year of the Republic, serving as the Deputy Consul-General in Shanghai. During his tenure, he abused his authority to the fullest extent.

<h3>Plan for Peace Education Developed by the US Delegation to the United Nations; Restore World Education and Culture to Its Former State</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 31st dispatch] Hovde, a specialist secretary for the United States delegation to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in London, stated: "We must use education to make people deeply believe that war is not necessary; otherwise, the United Nations organization and any other stabilization mechanism will be nothing more than decorations. We must develop a global 'Peace Education' plan, using classrooms, radio, newspapers, movies, and speeches as the medium for disseminating this education." Peace education should include the following points: (1) Educating the people of all countries to know how to make full use of their domestic resources to improve their living standards. (2) Nations with resources should share their materials with nations without materials. (3) Improve the morality of international individuals. In addition, international co-management of atomic energy, providing food aid to the starving, trusteeship of defensive bases, exchange of news, information and international students, and eliminating extreme ideologies in textbooks can all promote international friendship and eliminate hostility. In order to restore cultural and educational centers around the world to their former state, the United States should donate 150 million US dollars to promote its success. This is enough to prevent cultural decline and allow the world to save itself by following the path of art and science.</p>

<h3>Guanghua Cup Football Tournament Opens, Donghua to Face Italian Navy, Kickoff at Yiyuan at 10 AM This Morning</h3>
<p>The Guanghua Cup Football Tournament, organized to raise funds for the restoration of Guanghua University, has invited four strong teams from China and the West, Donghua, Qingbai, British Navy, and Italian Navy, to participate in the competition. It is a knockout system, with a total of three matches. The opening match between Donghua and the Italian Navy is scheduled to take place at Yiyuan at 10 AM this morning. Tickets are priced at 2,000 and 5,000 yuan, and there are also 100,000 yuan honorary seats available inside the venue, which can be used for all three matches.</p>
<p>Donghua's lineup has been slightly adjusted due to the departure of Zhuang Youren and Song Ling. Its strength is inevitably somewhat affected. Also, midfielder Fu Fuzhen has recently suffered from dysentery and originally planned to rest, but due to the lack of manpower, he had to take the field despite his illness. The team defeated the Western Union team with a partial lineup last week, which proves its extraordinary strength. Today, facing the Italian soldiers, it is hoped that they can overcome the enemy and achieve results.</p>
<p>The Italian Navy is the Anquili fleet that recently arrived in Shanghai. It defeated the British Navy 5-2 in a friendly match. This time, it has also borrowed the three musketeers, Taiboka, Kartza, and Bertattini, Corumb, which is even more icing on the cake. When they first meet the strong Chinese team, there will definitely be a wonderful performance.</p>
<p>Donghua: Zhang Banglun, Li Ning, Zhang Lingen, Han Longbo, Tan Fuzhen, Shen Jinda, Li Yao, Sun Jinshun, Han Longhai, Han Longgen, Jia Youliang, Zhen Mingzhe.</p>
<p>Italian Navy: Taiboka, Keimi, Teroka, Monfuti, Xi Kele, Luofu, Bertattini, Corumb, Migaojie, Dimiqi Lie, Pompeii, Bapilie.</p>

<h3>Answering Readers' Questions, Medical and Health</h3>
<p>(1) Hu Bonian asks: My sister is 26 years old. Starting in October of last year, her fingers and toes often turn pale and numb, and blood flow stops, but it returns to normal in about five or six minutes. Doctors said that there is nothing wrong with the blood vessels and nerves in her limbs, but her condition has been getting worse day by day. Her hands and feet have turned completely white. A month ago, she suddenly had knee pain, followed by pain in her head, neck, back, waist, and legs, which was unbearable and she could not move. Her appetite has gradually decreased, and she only drinks thin porridge all day. She is mentally exhausted. Is this phenomenon neuralgia? What medicine should she take? Is there any special medicine and specialist doctor?</p>
<p>(Dr. Yu Xin'en answers) The disease is called Raynaud's disease, which is caused by a disturbance in the vascular nerves. There is no special medicine. You can try taking thyroid hormones and applying moxibustion and massage locally. If it is ineffective, you can try surgery.</p>
<p>(2) Li Xingyuan asks: I have long admired your column for its enthusiasm in serving the society, and people from all walks of life have benefited greatly. My mother has been suffering from stomach problems for more than ten years. She is now 57 years old. At the beginning, she could still eat baking soda to treat it, but because my third brother died the year before last and my fourth sister died last year, and she was repeatedly threatened by the enemy puppets in the countryside, her condition has worsened in the past three years. Baking soda is no longer effective. Recently, she has been experiencing pain in her upper body, frequent vomiting, and has vomited coffee-colored filamentous blood. She cannot eat. I have consulted Chinese and Western doctors, but the treatment has been ineffective. The doctor said it is stomach cancer. Please advise on treatment methods.</p>
<p>(Dr. Yu Xin'en answers) It is indeed stomach cancer. If it is in the early stages, it can be surgically removed. Once it has metastasized, surgery is ineffective. Taking medicine and folk remedies is absolutely ineffective.</p>
<p>(3) Wang Yiqiu asks: Before my wife gave birth, her breasts were high and shapely. During her second childbirth, she breastfed, but after weaning, her breasts were not as good as before. Now, after her third childbirth, her breasts have become completely flat after weaning. Her breasts are no longer visible even with clothing on. My wife is very unhappy about this. Please advise on what methods and effective medicines can make her breasts high and restore their shapeliness?</p>
<p>(Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers) This is caused by a lack of internal secretion. You can try injecting female hormones, which should be effective.</p>
<p>(4) Guan Pinqiu asks: (1) There are small, red, swollen bumps on my face. When I press them with the side of my hand, there is a white, sauce-like liquid. This one heals, and another one appears. What method can be used to treat this? (2) My head is unbearably itchy, and the scalp is falling off in layers. Is it effective to wash it with a potassium permanganate solution?</p>
<p>(Dr. Zhang Zhongming answers) (1) This is acne, which can heal on its own. If the white serum squeezed out is made into a serum and injected into the body, it can be cured earlier. This is the so-called autogenous vaccine therapy. (2) It may be effective to rub your scalp with a 5% salicylic acid alcohol solution.</p>
<h3>Donation Report</h3>
<p>(1) All employees of the China Textile Factory No. 17 jointly donated 1,460,650 yuan for the Hunan-Guangxi drought to save the drought-stricken people. This amount was handed over to this office for transfer to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for separate handling.</p>
<p>(2) The "National Construction Contribution" initiated by readers in February of this year has received a total of 93,000 yuan. This amount was transferred to the Respect Teachers Campaign Committee yesterday to be used as respect teacher funds.</p>
<p>(3) The eight feet of clothing material (deputy silk) published on the 12th of this month for collection, if not claimed within the time limit, will be priced and transferred to charity. Since no one has claimed it, this office has priced it at 10,000 yuan and transferred it to the "Respect Teacher Fund" to benefit the loser.</p>
<p>Yu Zengqing Donates Wind-Heat Relief Medicine</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Zengqing, a reader of this newspaper, personally sent 80 boxes of first-aid Wind-Heat Relief Medicine produced by Sino-European Rongji Huafang yesterday, instructing us to distribute them to the poor and sick masses. As the hot summer is approaching, Wind-Heat Relief Medicine is a common household medicine. People from all walks of life who are poor and sick and in need can get it from this office. We express our sincere thanks to Mr. Yu for his enthusiasm for public welfare.</p>
<p>Seeking Ye Tianshi's Secret Formula for Treating Teeth</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: There was a prescription from Doctor Ye Tianshi of Suzhou for treating toothache, which distinguishes between heart fire, stomach fire, lung fire, and liver fire, and adds a few more flavors according to the upper, lower, left, and right sides. It has been repeatedly tested and proven to be miraculously effective. It not only saves the trouble of seeing a doctor, but also saves on medicine costs. Unfortunately, it was lost during the war, and none of my relatives and friends have it either. I am borrowing a corner of your newspaper to publish this letter. If readers have this prescription and transcribe it to be published in your newspaper, it will greatly benefit the common people and is a truly immeasurable deed. Zhang Yanqi</p>

The Bank of China allocated 21 strips, priced at 1.785 million. After that, it struggled around 1.79 million. In the afternoon, it was even more mediocre.

The lending side was loose for insiders and tight for outsiders. The interest rate was 13 to 15% for insiders and 18 to 20% for outsiders.</p>

The afternoon was the same. As a result, it fell slightly by 5 yuan compared to the previous close. There were rumors of a depreciation of Hong Kong dollars, falling by about 5 yuan. Robi and Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were still being sold at the previous price. The official and unofficial US exchange rates did not change, and transactions were difficult to facilitate.</p>
<p>Public bonds were initially weak and then stable yesterday. A weaving industry idle fund bought them after they fell, and the market atmosphere became active again. The Unified C opened at 6,700 yuan in the morning, but soon fell below 6,500 yuan before it was maintained. It once rose to around 6,850 yuan in the middle, but it was difficult to maintain, and it continued to be sold, falling again to 6,500 yuan. It stabilized slightly at noon. As a result, it still fell by 300 yuan compared to the previous close. A and B fell by 150 yuan, D fell by 200 yuan, and E fell by 100 yuan.

<h3>Yarn Prices Gradually Decline, Spot Cotton Trading is Still Good</h3>
<p>The yarn market turned weak again yesterday. Sales of green cotton were not sustained, and gold prices fell. The Shuangma cotton was initially stable in the morning, but it gradually declined as more and more people sold it, to 1.3 million. The other branches also fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan compared to yesterday. Due to the fact that the Shangri-La textile factory had a blue phoenix double-strand supply, the demand in the market decreased, and the price of 42 blue phoenix could not be sustained and retreated, closing at 2.52 million, a drop of more than 60,000. Yesterday, the "New York and American Cotton Telegraph" reported an increase of 10 to 12 pounds. The spot price for cotton was 28.05 for near-term US dollars, 28.63 for far-term, and 28.67 for spot cotton. Spot cotton trading in this port was still good. Private yarn factories slightly purchased cotton. The raw material price for Pootung textile machinery cotton 16s sent to the factory was as high as 100,000 yuan, which is on par with fine velvet raw materials.</p>
<h3>The Cloth Market is Slightly Weak</h3>
<p>Profits from the cloth market were being sold, and at the same time, it was the time for China Textile to start selling, and many parties slightly sold off, so the market trend became weak. In the morning market, plain cloth and serge fell by 500 yuan to 1,000 yuan. However, as the shilin cloth gradually entered the peak season, the market conditions were no longer as sluggish as in the past. In the afternoon, it was heard that the goods listed for sale by China Textile were still very few. Only the V dragon head was available for 12-pound fine cloth, and the 3A color ball was limited to dyeing factories. Only 34 households were eligible for light green serge from No. 132 to No. 1042, with each household being allocated 20 pieces.</p>
<h3>Chinese Tallow Gradually Improves</h3>
<p>The situation of Chinese tallow has gradually improved since the soap factory took over. Seventy to eighty percent of the goods stored in this port have been shipped out. Most of the prices are 40,000 yuan, while high-priced goods have fewer customers. Because the distribution sites and merchants do not have low stocks and do not lack materials. Only the goods from customers are slightly thin. The prices in Hankou and Hangzhou are similar to those in Shanghai. Therefore, it is not cost-effective to transport from there to here. As a result, the incoming goods are not very lively. If the weather is hot and soap use continues, it may improve again. Merchants sell to soap factories for 50,000 yuan, Sima scale, delivered to the factory, and sell for 60,000 yuan for this truck, 52,000 yuan for Neiping oil, 50,000 yuan for Dedian oil, 48,000 yuan for Du 砠 oil, 45,000 yuan for Lan oil, and 42,000 yuan for Macheng oil.</p>
<h3>China Farmers Bank Promotes Agricultural Loans, Reaching 6 Billion in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The countryside is devastated after the war. Since the China Farmers Bank resumed business in Shanghai, it has actively promoted agricultural loans, and it has handled loans for fertilizers, cotton, fisheries, agricultural tools, tea, and various grains separately. At present, the bank focuses on silk loans. The bank has sent personnel to conduct direct loans with silk farmers in Wuxi, Jiangyin, Suzhou, Wujiang, and other silk-producing areas, and has established agricultural loan offices in Wuxi and Suzhou to facilitate silk farmers. This time, the bank's silk loans are separately loaned for silkworm seed production, processing, and transportation. It is heard that 1.41 billion yuan has been loaned out, of which cocoon drying and mortgage account for 770 million yuan, with a weekly interest of 4%, and a term of three months. Currently, when silkworm cocoons are on the market, the market price is only 100,000 yuan per dan, while the actual cost is 150,000 yuan. It is a big question whether the market price will rise in the future, and whether it can rise above 150,000 yuan after the rise. It is heard that the China Farmers Bank has decided to expand the scope of agricultural loans as much as possible. In addition to the 1.41 billion yuan in silk loans, a total of 5.11 billion yuan has been loaned for fertilizers, tea, fisheries, and cotton cloth. Among them, fertilizer loans have been loaned 600 million yuan in Jiangyin, Fengxian, Songjiang, Jinshan, Nanhui, Suzhou, Changshu, Kunshan, and other eight counties, cotton loans have been loaned 160 million yuan in Taicang and Jiading, earth cloth loans have been loaned 150 million yuan in Jiangyin, fishery loans in this city are 200 million yuan, and tea loans are 4 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Escalating Increase, Gradual Decline: Rice Prices Drop Another Thousand Dollars; Food Administration to Purchase Vietnamese Rice Soon; Selling Price Not to Exceed 40,000 Dollars</h3>
<p>Yesterday, rice market activity slowed, buyers were hard to find. Japonica and Indica regular rice both fell by over a thousand dollars. Flour dropped slightly by one to two hundred dollars. Soybeans arrived and sales were even. The market was peaceful. Red beans were scarce, rising sharply by over a thousand dollars. Corn prices decreased by over a thousand dollars. Mung beans increased slightly. New broad beans, originally from this area, were dried along the dirt roads, and prices rose by two to three thousand dollars. Soybean cakes were being watched by buyers, but the situation was weak, with a slight drop of two to three hundred dollars. The oil market was firm in the morning but weakened in the afternoon. According to information from the rice market, yesterday's rice arrivals in the city included seven types such as white japonica, totaling over seven thousand dan (石). The types and amounts in dan (石) are as follows: white japonica 3,578, thin rice 936, early rice 901, sheep indica 415, Du indica 177, Wu indica 888, white regular 354.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to news from the Food Administration Special Commissioner's Office, in addition to contacting the United States and Canada for large quantities of food, they are also directly purchasing from nearby areas such as Annam and Qianluo. Recently, the office's order for rice from Annam has been shipped from Haiphong and is expected to arrive in Shanghai within days. The office has decided to sell it at the lowest price, with a price per dan not exceeding 40,000 dollars. As for the sales method, it will not be sold through the rice market but will be distributed fairly. In the future, if there is a large amount of imported rice, it will be distributed according to the household registration. It is reported that the rice ordered by government and merchants from Vietnam will arrive in Shanghai in large quantities of over ten thousand tons from mid-June onwards.</p>
<h3>Silk Trading Scarce, Silk Fabrics Reportedly Rising Across the Board Due to High Labor Costs and Taxes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was limited trading of No. 120 Great Bridge raw silk futures. Spot prices first called for 1.4 million dollars, with the lowest bid at 1.34 to 1.35 million dollars. The final price was 1.37 to 1.38 million dollars, slightly lower than the previous day by 20,000 dollars. Trading was quiet, and sentiment was weak, with a generally pessimistic outlook. Factory silk, 75% evenness, ordinary quality, had over ten bales purchased yesterday at a price of 2.125 million dollars. The price of raw silk for users was relatively stable. Dried silk was being purchased by Hangzhou merchants, with asking prices increased by 40,000 to 50,000 dollars, but transactions were scarce. Silk fabrics continued to be strong. American-Asian quilt covers rose by 10,000 dollars per hundred. Dachang checkered crepe was 4,360 dollars per yard, an increase of 50 dollars from the previous day. Hangzhou fabrics like Luo and spun silk were reportedly increasing in price across the board due to increased labor costs. Shengze goods were no exception. It is reported that local taxes will be levied soon, further increasing costs in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Woolen and White Goods Decline</h3>
<p>The woolen market, due to the seasonal lull and reduced pre-sales, saw buyers from this area and elsewhere delaying purchases. Except for seasonal goods selling well, most items were average. Yesterday, items such as white broadcloth, white straight tribute, white canvas, and top-quality white Shetland were generally declining in price. Their selling prices had reached their peak, and even with a drop of two to three thousand dollars per yard, they were still difficult to sell. High laundry costs and the high cost of living were also contributing factors.</p>
<h3>New Roasted Green Tea from Huzhou Looks Promising</h3>
<p>Domestic tea sales of various types were seen by shops and dealers in this area and in Suzhou, Wuxi, Tianjin and other places, so buying interest was maintained. Supply also responded quickly, so the trend continued to be firm. However, the new roasted green tea from Huzhou has been favored by the industry since its introduction. Unfortunately, both arrivals and inventory of this type are scarce. Although negotiations are underway, holders are heavily speculating, and the outlook is expected to be bright.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw spot shortages, and prices continued to rise. The association's quoted price for medium-grade white granulated sugar was 72,500 dollars, later rising to 73,500 dollars, an increase of 1,500 dollars. The company's warehouse price was 68,500 to 69,500 dollars, a similar increase. Four-and-a-half carloads of white sugar was 94,500 dollars, an increase of 2,500 dollars. Raw sugar was 65,000 dollars. Local cotton white sugar was 77,000 to 77,500 dollars, an increase of 1,500 dollars. Xinghua red sugar was 57,500 to 60,000 dollars. Xinghua white sugar was 70,000 to 72,000 dollars.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau Explains Recent Raw Silk Inspection Situation</h3>
<p>Raw silk exports account for a large proportion of China's export trade, and all parties attach great importance to this for the development of international trade. Cai Wuji, Director of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, issued the following statement regarding the Bureau's work on raw silk inspection: (1) Regarding the quality of raw silk, the raw silk currently inspected is mostly old silk from several years ago, with poor toughness. In addition to limiting domestic sales of silk gum that has deteriorated and moldy silk, and prohibiting export, the Bureau strictly inspects other slightly damaged silk, issues a quality inspection certificate, and lists the inspection results in detail, so that exporters can choose accordingly. (2) Regarding transportation vessels, due to the recent lack of sea transport vessels, the inspected raw silk is often delayed in export due to waiting for shipping schedules, or the inspection results are inevitably affected due to poor storage or careless handling. Therefore, the quality inspection certificate issued by the Bureau has instructions on the storage and time after inspection to indicate restrictions. (3) Regarding inspection work, honesty and speed are the Bureau's consistent policy. However, since the resumption of the Bureau after the victory and the start of inspection on February 21 this year, the housing is narrow, and the human, financial, and equipment resources are far inferior to those before the war. However, it still strives to overcome difficulties. For raw silk, it cooperates with the China Sericulture Company, and in addition to the specified time, it inspects overtime every day, and the quantity has doubled. Since April, it has averaged 4,000 bales per month, and it will continue to find ways to increase it in the future to increase the export trade of raw silk.</p>
<h3>Continued Imports of American and Indian Cotton</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The American Steel Company's "Flascoe," carrying 4,000 bales of cotton from Seattle, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and is currently unloading at floating docks 16 and 17. Furthermore, the British Company's manager "Stanhal," carrying 27,300 tons of cotton from Karachi, arrived at Wusong anchorage on Tuesday and is expected to be imported tomorrow, scheduled to berth at Qichang Warehouse for unloading.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Minsheng Company's "Minzu Transport" departed from Shanghai this morning directly to XuanChang, carrying 250 pieces of cloth and over 100 pieces of cotton yarn for shipment to Yi and transferred to Yu (Chongqing).</p>
<h3>New Taiwanese Grain Arrives</h3>
<p>(Taipei, May 31st Dispatch) The supply of grain in Taiwan Province has recently been abundant, and rice prices have gradually declined. In addition, this year's harvest in Kaohsiung, Pingtung, and other places is still abundant, and new grain has already arrived on the market at a selling price of only about 1,000 dollars per 100 catties.</p>
<h3>Transportation Prices for Sichuan Grain Have Been Set by the Ministry of Food</h3>
<p>The transportation prices for 30,000 tons of grain transported from Sichuan to relieve Beijing and Shanghai have been set by the Ministry of Food and various shipping companies: (1) Chongqing to Yichang is 91.200 dollars per ton, plus a return-trip subsidy of 57.000 dollars; (2) Chongqing to Hankou is 124.800 dollars per ton, plus a return-trip subsidy of 78,000 dollars; (3) Chongqing to Beijing is 158.400 dollars per ton, plus a return-trip subsidy of 99,000 dollars. The above transportation prices are equivalent to the transportation prices for commercial goods, and the return-trip subsidy is a subsidy, which all shipping companies are satisfied with.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] President Chiang's hand order in mid-month called for accelerating the transport of Sichuan grain. The Ship Allocation Committee immediately increased the allocation of ships and strengthened the transport from Chongqing to Yichang. However, after the ships arrived in Yichang, they continued to sail downstream for various reasons, so the transport volume from Chongqing to Yichang was actually small. According to statistics, from May 1st to 27th, a total of 1,345 tons were transported.</p>
<h3>Another State-Owned Enterprise: China Petroleum Corporation; Total Capital Temporarily Set at 100 Billion National Currency; Weng Wenhao Appointed Chairman of the Board and General Manager</h3>
<p>The state-owned China Petroleum Corporation was officially established at 9:00 yesterday morning. Weng Wenhao, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Chairman of the Board of the company, came to Shanghai from Nanjing to preside over the opening ceremony, which was very simple. The economic community in the city congratulated him. The total capital of the company is temporarily set at 100 billion national currency. The General Manager is also held by Chairman Weng, and the Assistant Managers are Zhang Zihui, Jin Kaiying, Yan Shuang, and Guo Keshe. It is reported that all enemy and puppet petroleum factories will be handed over to the company for takeover. According to Weng, due to China's industrial backwardness, the geological aspect was also lacking in detailed investigation and records in the past. Before the War of Resistance, only small-scale oil field exploration work was carried out in Shaanxi. Until after the war against Japan broke out, due to the enemy blockade of the coast, foreign oil supplies were cut off. In order to persist in the War of Resistance and increase fuel production, the government established the Gansu Oil Mining Bureau with the greatest strength and determination. After geological surveys, drilling and mining, and oil refining in the Laojunmiao area of Yumen County in Gansu Province, nine oil fields were completed, with a monthly oil production of more than 400,000 gallons. This oil completely supplied the Northwest transportation and made a great contribution to the War of Resistance. And in Sichuan Province, the Longchang, Nanan Petroleum Gully, and Jiangyou areas, after years of effort by experts, have completed the geological and drilling projects. There is now natural gas production, and it is generally believed that the three places have abundant oil reserves. The Sichuan Oil Mining Exploration Office is currently responsible for the mining and oil refining design projects. The oil mines and refineries in Taiwan received after the victory, although the factories and mines are slightly scaled, the oil production is very small, so the oil fields are also lacking. The company will add new oil refining machinery to Taiwan Province in the future in order to increase production. In the Northeast, there are also several oil refineries received, which are all using coal to refine oil, such as the Jinxi Oil Refinery and the Dalian Oil Refinery. According to the investigation results, the equipment is complete, but the output is limited. Now that the company has been established, it will supervise the national oil mines and oil refineries and start work one by one according to the steps, and the technology and equipment of each factory and mine will also be improved and added according to the actual situation, hoping that in a few years, China's oil can be self-sufficient. Weng does not plan to stay in Shanghai for a long time. The daily affairs of the Shanghai company will be handled by the Assistant Manager. Assistant Manager Jin Kaiying is also allowed to fly to the oil mining areas in Taiwan Province within days for further detailed investigation.</p>

<p>China Textile Construction Company yesterday afternoon specially invited the city's news media, by the business office deputy director Zhang Silu and Jiang Dixian, etc. reported, according to Yun: "Textile Construction Company recently Shanghai part of the textile factories start work has become more smooth, cotton arrived increased, spinning and weaving machine parts of the lack of problems are gradually resolved, skilled workers have returned, so the start work situation has achieved a better turn, start yarn spindles cloth machines gradually increased according to plan, day and night operation, daily production of cotton yarn of 1,000 pieces, cotton cloth of more than 20,000 pieces, cotton yarn in addition to a part of the factory self-use, the rest of the production of yarn and cloth, are sold in large quantities, in order to supplement the postwar domestic yarn and cloth is insufficient. According to the mid-May report, Qingdao's started spindles had increased to 173,408, and cloth machines to 4,217. Tianjin's started spindles had reached 177,058, and cloth machines to 5,097, which are still being actively increased. The production of Qingdao's factories is about 150 pieces of cotton yarn and 3,000 pieces of cloth per day, and the factories in Tianjin produce 148 pieces of yarn and 4,000 pieces of cloth per day. Due to insufficient electricity and lack of parts in the textile factories in the above two places, only daytime work is started.</p>
<p>In terms of business, due to the domestic shortage of cotton goods, the government has listed the export of cotton yarn and cloth as a ban, and temporarily adjusts the domestic needs and stabilizes the market price. The products sold are all spot goods, and no futures are sold to prevent hoarding and speculation. Taking the market price at the beginning of January this year as the base number 100, the main price changes in May were rice 785, oil 308, coal 238, cooked food 215, and 20-count yarn was only 148, and 12-pound fine cloth was 140, and the yarn and cloth showed a stable image.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the company's business office, in order to take into account the needs of yarn and cloth in various places and the parity price, the company is actively shipping goods to Chongqing, Guangdong, Tianjin, Yihang and other places for flat sale. The United States and Mexico have recently arrived in large quantities and need to be sorted out urgently, so they will not be able to respond to sales in the first and second phases. Once the internal sorting is completed, they will be sold as usual.</p>
<h3>Cocoon Loans of 15 Billion; Zhejiang Cocoon Crop Best in Jiaxing</h3>
<p>The 35-year spring cocoon loan syndicate of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces was established on the 7th of last month, with a total loan amount of 20 billion. The method is that the syndicate manages the funds and allocates receipts and payments, and the China Sericulture Company supervises the use and distribution of loans. It is reported that there are 53 silk companies that have been approved by the company, including 89 silk factories and 528 cocoon businesses. As of yesterday, the approved and paid loans have exceeded 15.2 billion. As for the loan standard, it is based on the number of silk vehicles of each company's affiliated silk factory, its production efficiency, power and cooking inspection equipment, etc. Each silk vehicle is purchased from three to twelve loads of dry cocoons as the standard. According to statistics from the China Sericulture Company, a 10 billion yuan loan is sufficient for use.</p>
<p>Also, Zhejiang Province's silkworm breeding has more local species, so the cocoon crop is also earlier. For example, places such as Wuxi are all improved, so it is slightly later. Recently, they began to be busy with purchases, and the spring cocoon harvest in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this year is best in Jiaxing, Zhejiang.</p>

<h3>Prelude to the Retreat of Cantonese Communist Armed Personnel to the North; Our Newspaper's Guangzhou Air Dispatch on the 25th; Special Correspondent Liang Feng</h3>
<p>A Long-Pending Issue Comes to a Conclusion</p>
<p>The issue of the Chinese Communist armed personnel in eastern Guangdong, along the East River, has been in dispute since last year. The Chinese Communists claim to have a certain number of troops there, but the General Headquarters argue that there are no Communist troops, only bandits. If they were troops, they would have unit designations and clear banners. Since they have no unit designations but are armed, they are naturally bandits. Thus, each side stuck to its position, and the issue remained unresolved from last year to this year.</p>
<p>On January 25th of this year, the 8th Group of the Peiping Military Mediation Department arrived here, including U.S. representative Colonel Miller, Communist representative General Fang Fang, and government representative Major Gong Weile. However, after their arrival, they could not begin their mediation work until the existence of Communist troops here was confirmed. The issue remained unresolved even after General Zhang Fakui and Mr. Zhou Enlai had private talks in Nanjing. Later, the representatives of the Three-Man Group Military Delegation, Colonel Cha Min, government representative Colonel Pi Zonggan, and Communist representative Cheng Zhi, came to Guangdong and consulted with the 8th Group and the authorized representative of the General Headquarters, Fu Du. The General Headquarters, complying with the following three principles instructed by Chairman Chiang, assisted in the implementation.</p>
<p>(1) The boarding location is Dapeng Bay.</p>
<p>(2) The number is over two thousand (not to exceed three thousand).</p>
<p>(3) The time is limited to one month, from the date of the start of the investigation to the date of boarding, and must not exceed.</p>
<p>Under these three principles, the General Headquarters representative negotiated ten resolutions with the delegation, including the transportation of 2,400 Communist armed personnel from the southern and northern regions of the East River and the northern Guangdong region to the Dapeng Peninsula, where they would board American ships and disembark in Yantai, Shandong, as well as specific details regarding the withdrawal of the Communist armed personnel. Thus, this long-pending issue was finally brought to a conclusion.</p>
<h3>Communist Armed Personnel Begin Retreat to the North</h3>
<p>These resolutions were announced on April 4th. However, by mid-May, these so-called non-bandits Communist armed personnel not only delayed their departure but also, during the relocation of troops stationed in the northern and southern regions of the East River, engaged in large-scale disturbances, looting everywhere, kidnapping and extorting, killing people, and extorting road tolls. This could not help but make the people of Guangdong worry again. Everyone was wondering: Are they really going to leave? When will they finally leave?</p>
<p>Finally, news came out on May 23rd that the Communist armed personnel had scheduled their retreat to the north, and that May 25th was set as the first day of the one-month period agreed upon. If no new problems arise, they should be completely withdrawn by June 24th according to the agreement.</p>
<h3>Four Executive Subgroups, Withdrawal Procedure</h3>
<p>Regarding their centralized withdrawal, the 8th Group already had a meticulous plan, which was implemented in accordance with the agreement. Four executive subgroups, A, B, C, and D, were sent to the southern, northern, and northern Guangdong regions of the East River. The routes and withdrawal procedures distributed by these four subgroups were as follows: Groups A and B, from Sandu Zhu to Pingshan, concentrated in Danshui on the third day. Group C, from Henghe to Longxi, Jinlong, arrived in Danshui for concentration on the third day. The longest route was Group D, from Fuxi in northern Guangdong, arriving in Zhoutian on the first day, and then, in order, passing through Datang, Longkou, Shatian, Zhangkeng, Baimang, Huilong, and Yazaipu on a daily basis to reach Danshui. A total of nine days to reach Danshui, then concentrated and moved to Dapeng Bay to prepare to board the ship. During the waiting period, they were stationed in Huangyuyong, Xintian, Pingshan Hui, Henggang Hui, and Shatoujiao. During their stay, U.S. medical personnel examined their physical condition and performed vaccinations and inoculations to prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases. The procedure for transporting the baggage train and boarding personnel was thoroughly discussed by the 8th Group and the Communist representative. After the date was determined, the U.S. ships were notified to prepare to transport these 2,400 Communist armed personnel to Yantai. The U.S. military's first group, including military transport, communications, and medical personnel, totaling fourteen people, led by Colonel Deling, had already arrived in Kowloon from Shanghai and was about to go to Dapeng Bay to assist the 8th Group's work.</p>
<h3>Develop Medals and Signs for Protection Along the Way</h3>
<p>For the convenience and safety of the executive subgroups and the Communist personnel during concentration, they developed some medals and signs. The executive subgroup personnel had heart-shaped armbands, blue on top with the white characters "Military Mediation," and red on the bottom with three white circles and a rectangular red-bordered breast badge. The Communist personnel had square flags, with a red triangle in the upper left and a white triangle in the lower right, with the words "Guangdong Communist Armed Personnel, Group/Team" written horizontally below. The flags were raised in front and behind the team for identification. In addition, each person was issued a blue-bordered breast badge with the words "Guangdong Communist Armed Personnel" on top and the name, age, and number below. These badges were issued by the 8th Group with a stamp. There was also a "Guangdong Communist Armed Personnel Reintegration Certificate," which was printed with the following text: "In accordance with the mediation of the Representatives of the Three-Man Conference, the armed personnel of this unit, except for 2,400 who will be transported to Shandong by U.S. ships for concentration, will all be reintegrated. Wang Heng, Major General, Representative of the Commissioner of the Guangzhou General Headquarters, has decided to guarantee non-discrimination. Comrade ×××, of Unit ×××, has been approved for reintegration and will return to × Province, × County. It is hoped that the military camps along the way will provide protection, and the local government of the member's hometown will provide settlement and employment. Given to ××× for safekeeping.</p>

<h3>All Expenses Required for Retreat to the North Have Been Resolved</h3>
<p>Secondly, regarding the expenses required for the Communist personnel to retreat to the north, the General Headquarters has borrowed 373.686 million national currency from the Communist side, of which 100 million has been given to the Communist representative, and the rest has been used by the General Headquarters to purchase grain, which will be paid after the purchased grain is converted to funds. In this way, the main difficulties in the retreat of the Communist armed personnel have been largely resolved.</p>
<p>At the 8th Group's reception for reporters on the 23rd, Communist representative Fang Fang said: "This retreat of the Guangdong Communist armed personnel to the north is to implement the promise of 'retreating armed personnel south of the Yangtze River,' and peace is the demand of the people of the whole country. This move by the Chinese Communists is enough to comfort the elders of Guangdong..."</p>
<p>Here, some may ask: Why was it said that there were no Communist troops here at first? This can be answered by General Wang Heng, representative of the General Headquarters, in his speech at the banquet hosted by Communist representatives Fang Fang and Hui Sheng on the 22nd for the U.S. military representatives of the 8th Group, the General Headquarters, and government representatives. He said: "In the past, the Communist armed forces had no unit designations or clear flags. It was impossible to distinguish between troops and bandits, and the issue of public order was of paramount importance, so pacification work was carried out. This did not mean that the Communist personnel were bandits. Later, the Peiping Military Mediation Department telegraphed that Director Zhang fully respected the opinions of the Military Mediation Department and established the Northern Mediation Agreement..."</p>
<h3>Special Compilation on the Headquarters’ Organization: A Record of Atrocities</h3>
<p>In short, the retreat northward of the Communist armed forces is what the people of Guangdong truly desire. Regardless of whether they were Communist soldiers or bandits in the past, the facts of their ravaging of local areas, robbery, and massacres are too numerous to mention. We can see this from the memorandum issued by the Headquarters yesterday, numbered 行字第廿三 to the Eighth Group. It stated, in part: "The Headquarters has repeatedly received complaints from the people of the Beijiang area that, in recent months, scattered bandits in Beijiang have been causing disturbances towards the border of Jiangxi, looting Changjiang Market twice. Furthermore, on April 19th, they abducted Deng Juntang, the deputy chief of Changjiang Township, and Zhou Zhenmin, Liu Yuchao, and three other merchants, seizing all their property. Evidence found in documents proves that these actions were purely committed by armed personnel from the Communist side. Such inhumane acts of massacre and harm to people's lives and property by the Communists should be the responsibility of the Communist side for compensation, as requested by your group…" It also stated: "In recent months, Communist armed personnel have been colluding with bandits everywhere, taking advantage of the period before the start of the Northern Transportation to commit countless robberies and massacres. We have compiled a 'Record of Communist Atrocities' detailing the most egregious of these incidents, attached for your review, and respectfully request that it be included as part of your investigation materials…" Although this "Record of Communist Atrocities" has not been published, it is clearly titled as such, and we can naturally understand its meaning.</p>
<h3>Oriental Venice: The Charm of Liangxi</h3>
<p>— Wuxi, 20th [of May] Dispatch, Gao Wuhong</p>
<p>Wuxi, a major town on the Nanjing-Shanghai railway line, a land of fish and rice with beautiful mountains and rivers, prosperous industry and commerce, and stunning scenery, has a population of over one million. People call it "Little Shanghai." This Jiangnan water town is also sometimes referred to as "Oriental Venice" along with Suzhou, but many who have visited Wuxi say that Wuxi possesses an even richer "Venetian" charm. Wuxi is also known as Liangxi and Ronghu. Another name is Xishen, because Mount Xi was originally named Mount Xishen. Legend has it that Mount Xi originally produced tin, but the tin mines were eventually exhausted, hence the name Wuxi (Without Tin). After the founding of the Republic of China, Jinqui County was also incorporated into the territory of Wuxi.</p>
<h3>Backed by Mountains, Surrounded by Water, Facing Taihu Lake</h3>
<p>During the occupation, Wuxi was battered by artillery fire, and almost all of its best features were destroyed, leaving behind ruins and desolation. Everyone thought that after this catastrophe, it would be difficult to restore the city to its former glory, but the people of Wuxi possess an unbelievable capacity for reconstruction. Before long, the destroyed buildings in the bustling areas were gradually rebuilt. By the time the enemy surrendered, it had been completely restored as a magnificent city, and due to the rapid increase in population and the importance of political, military, industrial, and commercial aspects, it is even more prosperous and lively than in the past.</p>
<p>Before the war, Wuxi already had a plan to demolish the city walls and build a ring road. According to the current population and the development of industry and commerce, Wuxi may be re-established as a municipality in the future. Therefore, there are plans to widen all important streets to eight meters in the future to meet the conditions for establishing a municipality. The second is to demolish the city walls and build a ring road. In addition, there are plans to repair the Seventy-Two-Ring-Hole Stone Arch Bridge, which was destroyed when the National Army withdrew, and to build a model new village. Regarding these matters, the Construction Department of the County Government has prepared a detailed plan, which will be implemented soon. After the plan to build the new Wuxi is realized, we can sit in a car, enjoy the full view of Wuxi, and tour the scenic spots of Wuxi.</p>
<p>"To appreciate the charm of the Six Dynasties, build a thatched cottage by Mochou Lake." The reporter believes that if you want to "appreciate the charm of Wuxi scenery," then you must "tour the scenic spots around the lake." In terms of mountains, Wuxi's famous scenic spots include Huiquan Mountain, where the Second Spring Pavilion is well-known. As for the lakefront, there are Liyuan Garden, Yuzhuang Village, Dongda Pond, Meiyuan Garden, Xiaojishan Mountain, and Turtle Head Isle, all of which are destinations for tourists. Backed by mountains, surrounded by water, facing Taihu Lake, there is a unique majestic scenery. Compared with West Lake, one is a graceful maiden, and the other is a towering hero. Of course, the scenery of Wuxi inevitably lacks a sense of curvilinear beauty.</p>
<p>After the war, all the buildings in these places were demolished. In particular, Meige Pavilion only has a fragmented outline left. Doors and windows have disappeared without a trace. When people reflect on the past and lament the present, they can't help but feel infinite sorrow.</p>
<p>The most luxurious enjoyment for tourists is to hire a motorboat, plus a brightly painted and spacious barge, to take you to visit various places. The boatman can also prepare a sumptuous Wuxi boat meal for you. However, this expense is not affordable for the average person.</p>
<h3>Smokers Go Up the Mountain: Group Smoking Cessation</h3>
<p>Today, when the eradication of opium is being carried out vigorously, Wuxi is also taking the same steps as other places. Without prior self-registration, a strict search found a total of 451 smokers. This group of smokers has been concentrated in the Wanan Zen Temple on Zhongdu Mountain for compulsory detoxification, giving them a chance to start anew.</p>
<p>Zhongdu Mountain is a small island in Taihu Lake. Wanan Zen Temple is located on the top of the mountain on this island. The location is very desolate, and people rarely visit it at ordinary times. Choosing this place is also a good way for them to repent. Among the four hundred smokers, women accounted for one-tenth. The age ranges from seventy-two to eighteen years old, and the eighteen-year-old is a woman. There is also a monk among them. All kinds of people from all walks of life are gathered here.</p>
<p>The mountain is heavily guarded, with a sentry every fifty steps. Smokers can't even think about crossing the line. A supervision office has also been established to manage these smokers. The smokers' lives are very hard, and their food is rough. They have a deep feeling of "knowing today, regretting not in the first place." I hope they can train themselves in hardship and start a new life!</p>
<h3>Cultural and Educational Undertakings Are Gradually Becoming Active</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Xishi Teachers' College, Jiangsu Educational Institute, and Wuxi Guoxue College have been restored. The school buildings of Private Xizhong were destroyed and cannot be restored. Except for Furen Middle School, the rest have also moved back to Wuxi, gradually returning to the pre-war state.</p>
<p>National Fudan University and the Frontier School have decided to move to Wuxi. Fudan's school buildings are at Daleizui, and the Frontier School has chosen the Taihu Hotel and Zongjing Villa in Meiyuan Garden as school buildings. As soon as the construction is completed, they will move to Wuxi to start classes. In the beautiful environment, Wuxi, this ancient city that has put on new clothes, will go further and occupy an important position in education.</p>
<p>Before the war, Wuxi's newspaper industry ranked first among local newspapers. During the occupation, the newspapers were under the control of the enemy and puppets, and only one "official" "Wuxi Daily" was full of absurdity and had no achievements. After the war, the newspaper industry took the opportunity to rise, and the newspaper industry, which had been silent for eight years, became lively. There are now four daily newspapers: Xibao, Jiangsu Minbao Wuxi Edition, Renbao, and Daxibao. Except for Daxibao, the other three have their own printing facilities. In addition to competing in business, there are few improvements in layout and content.</p>
<p>The more commendable one is Xibao, with its new layout and fast news. It also has dispatches from special correspondents from all over the world. The editorials do not seem to be too important. The supplement is biased towards the Shanghai style, which, from a business point of view, is to cater to the psychology of readers. Strictly speaking, it is somewhat low-level.</p>
<p>Wuxi is a large rice market and a distribution center for rice and grain. Rice and paddy from the surrounding rice-producing areas are concentrated in Wuxi and then transported to various ports. Therefore, the amount of rice and grain stored in Wuxi and the rise and fall of prices are enough to affect the entire rice market.</p>
<p>This time, the skyrocketing rice price, as observed by the reporter, is mainly due to the Shanghai Grain Administration issuing a huge amount of grain loan funds. The rice worms got this money and went to various production and sales areas to purchase. The local rice reserves were gradually emptied by them, forming a phenomenon that supply exceeded demand. Within a month, the rice price in Wuxi jumped from 27,000 yuan to over 60,000 yuan. The culprits should first ask the rice merchants who got the grain loan funds!</p>
<p>This time, the soaring rice price seems to be a planned action by the rice worms. Banning exports and forcibly suppressing prices are not fundamental solutions, but only create better opportunities for unscrupulous merchants. Now, just ask them: Do you want to starve to death the compatriots who have suffered from war after seeing today's victory? (May 20th)</p>

<h3>A Plea for the Compatriots of Northern Jiangsu!</h3>
<p>Editor: For the sake of human justice, for the sake of world civilization, and even more for the sake of our suffering people of Northern Jiangsu, I respectfully appeal to the government, and appeal to just people in society, hoping that the government will pay attention, and hoping that people in society will provide relief, to save Northern Jiangsu from its misfortune, and quickly save our people who have fallen into the "Liberated Zone"!</p>
<p>Ever since the New Fourth Army arrived in Northern Jiangsu, the people have not had a single day of peace. The fat of both the rich and the poor has been squeezed dry. What is most heartbreaking is that they loudly shouted the slogan of "fighting the Japanese devils," but in the end, they did not fire a single shot. Instead, they completely gave the towns and cities of Northern Jiangsu to the enemy, causing us to suffer the life of a subjugated slave for several years unjustly. And what did they do? They engaged in behind-the-lines movements, using the guise of resisting the enemy to seduce young people, using local thugs, and using unscrupulous means to deceive, plunder, and destroy, trying to expand their military power and extend their territory day by day, regardless of the life or death of the people.</p>
<p>After Japan surrendered, their fake anti-Japanese sign lost its effect. At the same time, the stimulus of rent reduction, tenancy strike, and strikes no longer aroused the interest of farmers. So, they staged an extremely barbaric tragedy, the so-called "forty-five days of great struggle, no democracy within three months"! That is, landlords were killed, middle peasants were killed, rich peasants were killed, bosses were killed, gentry were killed, intellectuals were killed, local self-government personnel were killed, rural military and political party members were killed, and impartial ordinary people were also killed. They were killed one by one, and the relatives and friends of the victims were also implicated. They called it the work of removing the root of the tumor.</p>
<p>In recent months, the people of Northern Jiangsu have been dying, fleeing, filling the household [with corpses], and those who cannot leave are waiting for the arrival of the god of death, living a life of suffering like ants on a hot pot. Every day, they mobilize a group of local thugs to find you to confess, to find you to fight, forcing you to create debts out of nothing, forcing you to confess to trumped-up charges (Nationalist spies, hoping for the Central Government, undercover agents, and what kind of curved line, comfortable, economic, ideal, mobile, etc. traitors), and then tell you to first suffer live torture, and then suffer the death penalty, and then add the punishment of confiscating property. Their achievements are indeed not bad. The following is a summary of their recent brutal performances and secretive deployments: (1) Killing: Their killings have no factual basis, no legal standards, and are promoted by the county government sending the government to various districts. The so-called "suppression of traitors" work rewards local thugs for reporting good people, and mobilizes militiamen to hold meetings to make public decisions. On the surface, it holds public trials, but in fact, it has been secretly decided long ago. The victims are first beaten to death, and then stabbed with knives indiscriminately. The families are not allowed to collect the bodies, and the corpses are exposed in the fields to feed the dogs. The number of people in Northern Jiangsu who have been sacrificed under this cruel torture is countless. For example, Liu Shouming, Liu Mianzai, Miao Kejun, Miao Lianbai, Zhou Youmin, Cai Shunyan, Cai Junjie, etc. in Dongtai County, they either have a little knowledge, or a little property, or a little reputation. Because they are not used and not deceived, they are suspected and inexplicably killed.</p>
<p>(2) People's Prison: This is also a kind of punishment that mobilizes the militia to suggest public decision. The victims are sentenced to a certain period of imprisonment, with a wooden sign of a prisoner hanging on their necks, shackles nailed to their feet, and they supply their own prison rations. If they take a step out of the house, anyone can beat them to death. There are too many people suffering from this crime, such as Huang Xitao in, Qian Buqing, Wu Shuhai, Wu Shanzhi in Shuangdian, Cai Zhongheng, Miao Xiusheng, Xu Linan, Miao Chengcheng, Kang Hanchen, and Miao Xixuan in Tea, who are temporarily exchanging their lives under this kind of punishment.</p>
<p>(3) Tattooing: This is a disguised form of people's prison, which is popular in Chahe, Matang, and other areas of Rufou County. The so-called Ming traitors (those who participated in puppet organizations), the greedy traitors (those who did not participate in puppet organizations, but were mobilized by them with the militia, indicating the rogue, insisting that you are an ideal traitor, a curved-line traitor), the Chiang Kai-shek faction, Nationalist spies (leaning towards the central government or having Kuomintang membership), if they escaped the death penalty, they could not escape ink torture. The words "traitor" are tattooed on your forehead, and a certain area is designated for you to move around. If you leave the circle, you will be killed without pardon.</p>
<p>(4) Parading through the streets and villages: This is the most common punishment. In the towns of the Liberated Zone, gongs and drums are played every day, and the streets are paraded. All men and women wearing long gowns and cheongsams are hard to escape. For example, Ren Xiaoan in Shuangdian, Liu Zeren in Rushishi, Li Zheng in Chahe, and Miss Han Er in Hai'an were reported by the gangsters, wearing paper-bag hats and parading in red cloth pants.</p>
<p>(5) Confiscation and Fines: Many people have already been sentenced to death or imprisonment, but this is not enough. In addition, the farmland is confiscated, the houses are demolished, and you are killed and your property is emptied, so that everything is clear. For those who can barely make ends meet, their government encourages local thugs to settle accounts with you. Again and again, the endless accounts are settled, and each settlement is a fine. Hundreds of loads and five hundred loads are spoken casually. If you can't get them out, the farmland will be auctioned, the houses will be demolished, and if it's not enough, you have to sell your sons and daughters to settle it. For example, Liu Zhoucheng, Ren Jiyu, Xie Yuan, and Ji Yucheng in Libao, Miao Yunong and Miao Boming in , Chen Zhonghua in Juegang, etc. have all suffered this kind of bankruptcy loss.</p>
<p>(6) Kowtowing: People sentenced to this kind of punishment are fined to kowtow along the door, which is a kind of lingering punishment. You will bleed and slowly die within a day. For example, Zhang Qiangjiu and Wu Mou in Fengli, Guo Yukun and Chen Zaitang in Matang, etc. all died under the kowtow punishment.</p>
<p>(7) Special Organizations: (1) Smelling incense team, specializes in investigating which family eats well. Once found, they come to the door to struggle and identify. (2) The eavesdropping team is a more powerful organization than Zhou Lizheng's censorship. They listen in the streets and alleys during the day, and hide in people's doorways and corners at night, listening to family whispers. If there are private words complaining about their tyranny, you will be killed on the third day.</p>
<p>(8) Others: (A) There are many tricks, too many to count. There is also the punishment of hoping for the central government, hanging people high on a tree and asking if you see the central government. Then the rope is untied, and you fall into a puddle of flesh. (B) A person surnamed Zhang in Rufou said in a teahouse: "Eat more and talk less." He was fined to eat twenty bowls of rice. As a result, his stomach and intestines burst, and he died immediately. (C) During the Lantern Festival in the first month, there was a lantern riddle "Japan surrenders," playing a famous ancient person. At that time, someone guessed it was "Qu Yuan." They were not very satisfied and insisted that it was "Su Wu." Everyone, what do you think is the reason for this? (D) Those who are considered sinners by them are all listed on the paper list, posted for circulation. The executed prisoners are written on the white list, those who have been punished and temporarily released are written on the green list, and those who have not been sentenced are placed on the yellow list. But those who have not been sentenced and those who have not died should be happy for the time being, because there is a good chance that your yellow list will be promoted to the green list, and the green list will be promoted to the white list. (E) At first, they used candles to confuse workers and peasants and launched struggles. The grain they demarcated was unable to be paid by the capitalists. They sold the farmland to the tenant farmers at auction. The price of the land was used to pay for the fines, and each household was required to pay 200 catties of rice per mu for the tax deed fee. In this way, they obtained countless food, which they transported away by sea, causing famine in Northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>At first, we were fascinated and hoped that the Political Consultative Conference would be successful and that China would peacefully enter democracy. But the facts tell us that the Communist Party has no sincerity at all for the word "consultation," but uses the name of consultation to delay time, expand its territory, and wait for an opportunity to satisfy their ambition to redden the whole country. Therefore, they have recently killed and expelled non-party people, burned books and buried scholars, emulating the First Emperor of Qin, forcing young and strong people to fill their military power as much as possible, searching for materials, attacking the National Army, destroying the system, and loudly calling for the slogan of liberating the five continents (Tongzhou, Yangzhou, Taizhou, Xuzhou, Zhengzhou). Therefore, the more lenient the government is, the more the Communist Party will expand, and the more the people will be ravaged! If you don't believe it, please come to the "Liberated Zone" and taste the taste of their "democracy"!</p>
<p>Their most recent secret grassroots organization and deployment in the Liberated Zone is a very strict and extremely dangerous organization. (The following is the structure in one of their townships.)</p>
<p>(1) Township (Town) Government: Under the command and supervision of the instructor, the township (town) chief and deputy lead the following five organizations: (A) Grain Restoration and Micro-Collection: The director leads the cashier, investigator, manager, and accountant to manage the search of grain, taxes, and materials in the whole township (town). (B) Village and Group: According to the terrain and area of the whole township, several villages and several groups are divided, controlling several households and several strong men, and promoting all their administration. (C) School: In addition to implementing children's education, there are several hours of adult education every day, the purpose is to adopt the purpose of education and change of thought. (D) Conscription and Military Service: The regiment leader leads the two groups of preferential treatment and consolation, attracting young and strong people by any means, and attracting blind followers, with the principle of achieving the goal. (E) Personnel Research: The autonomous secret leadership leads the research and reconnaissance of two groups, using unscrupulous means to investigate, research, the remarks and beliefs of the three-capital elements, and the military, political, and party members in the field, whether there are hostile trends, how can they be used, and how to attack and eradicate all kinds of conspiracies.</p>
<p>(2) Militia Brigade: The instructor supervises the brigade commander (deputy) to command the following three organizations: (A) Militia sub-team: The principle of compiling is one sub-team per village, and three or four villages per company. During the active period, several brigades can be assembled at any time to form a national camp, distribute weapons, such as rifles, grenades, bayonets, etc., to serve as the outer perimeter warning of its main force, or the vanguard force during the attack. (B) Backbone Team (formerly known as Model Team): Selected from the militia to form a strong man. They are often equipped with weapons, long and short guns, grenades, bayonets, and sometimes equipped with light machine guns and grenade launchers. They move in the area. The military appearance is young and strong, sometimes disguised, sometimes armed, the lineup is sometimes neat and sometimes sparse, and even lurking motionless, it is not easy to detect. His activities are sometimes like a storm, and sometimes like a few morning stars. (C) Special Agent Team: Selected excellent members from the very backbone team, strictly organized, led by the team leader to destroy, contact, kill (also known as removing traitors), enemy work, etc., four groups secretly implement all work.</p>
<p>(3) Civil Movement: The instructor supervises the township head (also the branch director), and the directors of the Youth, Labor, Agriculture, Commerce, Science, Students, Women, and Fishery Federations (formerly known as the Anti-Japanese Association) lead the directors and group leaders, instigate hints, mobilize blind followers, cause disputes, and create massacres. Nothing more than disturbing the society, taking advantage of Zhang Renqing, and so on, countless tricks. Above two to three townships, below the district level, there are also district party branches, party committees of various departments, security organizations (assassination leadership agencies), traffic branch stations, industrial and commercial bureaus and industrial and commercial management bureaus (specializing in searching for donations and taxes to control materials), enemy work detachments, and other leading agencies and secret organizations.</p>
<p>What is urgent now is the issue of summer harvest. They dispatch troops from all directions and are active in the countryside, the so-called "defending the summer harvest." At the same time, the work of their grassroots personnel is also very tense, preparing for grain levies, badges, grain offerings, fines, conscription, and other tasks of searching and expanding the army. The bitter life of the people of Northern Jiangsu, when will the time of starvation end!</p>
<p>The dead are gone. How will the tens of millions of refugees who have escaped from the hands of death and are living on the starvation line survive, or go back to be slaughtered by the Communist Party, or wait to starve to death outside? In addition to rescuing us, the government must know that Northern Jiangsu is close to Beijing, and it is dangerous to become a separatist situation! Therefore, the Northern Jiangsu issue is by no means a minor issue, and it must not be compromised or delayed any longer!

<h3>"Sichuan Brocade" in Poverty and Sickness</h3>
<p>— Chengdu, 22nd Day (Air Mail) Zhou Yangquan</p>
<p>In terms of clothing, people consistently say "Hangzhou Silk and Suzhou Embroidery (also called Zhou Embroidery), Beijing Satin, and Sichuan Brocade" together. They are praised as the four famous products of our country, enjoying a great reputation not only domestically but also internationally as treasures. Now, leaving the first three aside for the moment, we will now give a brief introduction to the current situation of Sichuan Brocade:</p>
<p>Sichuan Brocade, at the mention of this name, anyone who has appreciated it will praise its artistry. Especially people from outside the province admire it and long for it. Allied friends, when they came to Chengdu in the past, were most attracted by this beautiful Sichuan Brocade. Sichuan Brocade, it has blossomed with many years of honor for Sichuan. When people think of it, they will think of Sichuan.</p>
<h3>Crystallization of Handicraft, Forged from Blood and Sweat</h3>
<p>Sichuan Brocade can be said to be a crystallization of handicraft. It is forged from blood and sweat. There is no machinery involved at all; it all relies on hands, the hands of millions of people creating it. On the Chengdu Plain is the concentrated area where it is born. In the urban area of ​​Chengdu, those who specialize in Sichuan Brocade are numerous. According to investigations, before the War of Resistance, there were more than 1,000 families. Now, due to the decline of industry and commerce, it has been reduced to more than 700 families. The maximum number of looms per family is seven or eight, but those with two or three looms account for more than half. On average, each family has about three looms, which amounts to more than 2,000 looms based on 700 families. These looms are all wooden. The most common length of the loom is twelve feet, quite similar in structure to wooden weaving looms, except that the number of warp threads can be as high as eight layers. Because of this, the finished product can exhibit a silky sheen. As for the shuttle, it is also slightly longer, with iron tips about five inches long at both ends. The workers send it back and forth with their hands, little by little. The upper end of the loom where the threads are drawn is high up in the middle of the house, while the lower end where the weaving takes place is sunk below the excavated ground level. Therefore, the looms are all installed on mud ground, dug into a pit more than three feet deep.</p>
<h3>With Each Pass, Beautiful Patterns are Woven</h3>
<p>Each loom requires two workers. One is called the "Upper Hand," who is responsible for pulling the threads and raising the patterns at the upper end, occasionally organizing the warp threads. The other is called the "Lower Hand," who is actually responsible for the weaving. He sits on the loom, with most of his body below the pit. The craftsmanship of the "Lower Hand" must be higher than that of the "Upper Hand." Thousands of patterns are engraved in his mind, and with each pass of his hand, he can weave various animals, birds, flowers, and all kinds of beautiful patterns. There are no models, no templates, all relying on memory. Even the most skilled painter would marvel at it.</p>

<h3>More Than Four Thousand Workers Live in Gloom</h3>
<p>More than two thousand looms, more than four thousand workers, they live in gloomy, poorly ventilated old-fashioned houses. It is strange to say that finished Sichuan Brocade products are all displayed in the most prosperous downtown areas, while the places where they are made are hidden in narrow alleys and remote streets. Who would have thought that beautiful and pretty Sichuan Brocade would be born in such dusty and filthy places! They are mostly hired workers. In addition to the food and lodging provided by the owner, their wages are based on piecework. The "Lower Hand" can get more than a hundred yuan per foot, while the "Upper Hand" only gets seventy or eighty yuan per foot. A ten-foot-long quilt cover can be delivered in two days. They work from morning till night, the looms making slight clattering sounds. Their lives are dull and monotonous. On everyone's forehead are deeply carved lines of worry, their faces pale. Furthermore, due to the demanding memory required for raising patterns and dividing silk, many older people have bald heads. With no rest and no entertainment, they work like oxen, spending their arduous years from morning to night, from spring to autumn, year after year. On the walls of the house, there are wads of red silk thread that they have chewed, and those clumps of silk thread can make people mistake them for horrifying blood clots, which gives sensitive people a somewhat terrifying feeling.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the entire urban area can produce several thousand feet of finished products per day. Because of the shortage of funds, they rarely stock goods; most are based on orders or pre-orders from merchants. Therefore, sometimes when they accept pre-orders and silk prices rise, they not only have to weave for others with pain but also have to endure losses with pain. It is said that this year, sales have been hampered, and merchants are unwilling to buy in large quantities. In addition, this year's spring drought has greatly affected silk production, increasing the cost of purchases, making it even more difficult to sell goods, and bringing them closer to bankruptcy. A "Lower Hand" sitting on the loom told the reporter that they had to follow their master for four years when they were young. Because raising patterns and dividing silk are difficult, he has been doing it for fourteen years now, and he still feels that he has not "mastered it." With infinite sighs, he said, "Our trade can no longer be done." Seeing how many mouths and how many hands are becoming more and more convulsive in this industrial and commercial bankruptcy, the reporter left the dim workshop with a heavy heart.</p>
<h3>A New Look for Mount Lu: Preparing for a Summer Academic Lecture Series</h3>
<p>— Nanchang, 25th Day (Correspondence) Deng Guihua</p>
<p>Mount Lu's scenery is serene and secluded, making it a famous summer resort in the country. The Jiangxi Provincial Government, with the summer vacation approaching, expects visitors from home and abroad to come to the mountain for recreation. At the same time, there is news that Chairman Chiang will also be stationed at Guling for office work and summer relaxation. Therefore, all restoration and construction projects are being carried out diligently.</p>
<p>The 13-kilometer road from Jiujiang to Lianhua Cave has had its renovation funds submitted to the Central Highway Administration for allocation. To save time, the Highway Department has advanced 20 million yuan from the Central Government's allocated funds for various engineering projects. The Xun (Jiujiang) -Gu (Guling) telecommunications line is currently being actively repaired by the Directorate General of Telecommunications of the Ministry of Communications and will be able to provide telegraph and telephone services in one or two weeks. The roads from Guling as the center to various famous scenic spots were completed by Japanese prisoners of war a long time ago. Scenic areas and various buildings in the mountains are also being thoroughly renovated. Chairman Chiang's residence has also been repaired and renovated. It is heard that in order to promote academics, the province will hold a summer lecture series in Mount Lu, divided into eight groups: education, physical education, English, mathematics and physics, chemistry, natural history, literature and history, geography, and art. The time is tentatively set for one month, from July 15th to August 15th. At that time, famous scholars and dignitaries will gather, and the famous mountain will surely become even more colorful. The Jiangxi Provincial Government, considering Jiujiang as the gateway to Jiangxi, which was destroyed by the enemy during the eight years of the War of Resistance and is now in a dilapidated state, has ordered the county government to renovate and refresh the three main trunk lines in order to welcome Chinese and foreign summer visitors who will soon arrive.</p>
<h3>Human Waste Utilization: Chengdu Smokers Dredge Riverways</h3>
<p>— Chengdu, 26th Day (Air Mail) Zhou Yangquan</p>
<p>The municipal government's use of smokers to dredge the Jin River and Yu River has been completed for several months.</p>
<p>Recently, a primitive forest was discovered in the Shennongjia area of ​​the Wushan mountains, towering and lush, reaching into the clouds, with three types of trees. According to investigators, the timber produced in that area, if felled, could supply the needs of the entire country's railways for fifty years. Relevant authorities will jointly form a company to carry out large-scale development.</p>
<p>Before the National Government moved its capital, Chairman Chiang's instructions upon arriving in Chengdu were printed by the provincial government as a military handbook and distributed to various government agencies, organizations, and schools for reference. Chairman Zhang Qun of the Provincial Government, Yue Jun, wrote a "Respectful Reading" article on these instructions, attached to the end, so that readers could understand it more deeply. The separate edition is being rushed into print.</p>
<p>The Chengdu Municipal Government has designated South China West as an experimental demonstration district. In the recent election of Jia chiefs, university presidents, professors, etc., participated, and Zhang Linggao, president of China University, was elected as the district chief. The Bao residents' enthusiasm for registering for public office with the Municipal Government was very high. Among them, Provincial Governor Zhang Cui and University Professor Chen Zhushan will be candidates for Bao chief.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government is planning to build a social hall for the masses. At the same time, it will open a public theater for the masses in the Zhengzheng Public Hall (formerly renamed Shao City Public Hall). All detailed measures are being planned.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government is actively improving traffic in the city and has decided to renovate the road surface. It is stipulated that the center of the street will be four meters wide and made of cement, and both sides will be made of crushed coal cinders. Depending on the degree of dilapidation and traffic needs, repairs will be made in order of urgency. The materials will be paid for from the collected engineering benefit fees, and the workers will be slightly adjusted by national compulsory labor.</p>
<p>Sichuan Province is reforming and modeling itself as a model province. The provincial government is currently accelerating the discussion of the five-year plans of various departments. Those that have been discussed and completed include: education, construction, land administration, health, accounting, tobacco ban, security, and social affairs. The other eight departments, such as civil administration and finance, will also be completed soon.</p>
<p>Electricity supply in Chengdu initially stopped once every ten days, then once every three days, then every other day, and finally stopped every day and at any time. However, recently, the Qiming Electric Factory repaired the Jiaozijie and Yongni Zhai factories and announced the restoration of the three-day shutdown system. From this, we can know the content of Chengdu's electrical expertise.</p>
<p>The construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has been decided to start in July this year. Construction Director He Beiheng is currently in Shanghai negotiating materials.</p>
<p>The municipal government used smoking offenders to dredge the Jin River and Yu River, which has now been completed, which can truly be said to be "utilizing waste."</p>
<p>The past month or so has been an eventful autumn for the education sector in Chengdu. Three cases of shooting and murder have occurred one after another: (1) Wen Ziguang, a fourth-year student at Chenghua University, was killed by Company Commander Xie Fengchun near Songxian Bridge. (2) Zhang Guogong, a student at Lida Middle School, stabbed Zhu Peisheng, the director of training, with a sharp knife. (3) Long Shizheng, a student at Huangpu Middle School, stabbed his classmate Sun Wenzhong to death. All three cases are under investigation in the local court.</p>
<h3>Children of Okinawa</h3>
<p>Children of Okinawa play outside a schoolhouse covered with thatch. The people of the island, under the supervision of the U.S. Military Government, manage their own government. After the victory, the island began construction work, which has now reached a considerable scale.</p>
<h3>Military-Civilian Cooperation in Zhuji. 20th Day, Zhuji Correspondence.</h3>
<p>— Dang Dai</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Security Second Regiment and the 187th Division are stationed here. The officers and soldiers of the latter unit have hardly had any minor frictions with the common people. For example, they are very polite when borrowing things, and return them after use. If there is any damage, they will compensate at the price without any complaint. For example, when shopping in the street, they never argue fiercely about prices. If they can afford it, they buy it. If they can't afford it, they walk away silently. I once saw with my own eyes: Once, an officer was walking on the road and was unfortunately hit by a reckless firewood carrier, and his skin was scratched. But he didn't make a sound, immediately got up, patted off the mud (it was raining that day), and walked away as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>The officers and soldiers of the 187th Division are very enthusiastic about public welfare undertakings. Recently, they selected 400 brothers to assist the county government in rushing to repair a section of road from the railway station to the city station, without receiving any hospitality, starting their own fires, and working voluntarily, and automatically decided to complete the rush repair within one month. Recently, the merchants in the urban area automatically raised money, a pig, and a jar of yellow wine, preparing to comfort them.</p>

<h3>Protest Against the Sale of Publicly Owned Theaters</h3>
<p>— Kang Tai</p>
<p>Several cinemas in Shanghai that were taken over by the local authorities from the enemy are now publicly seeking owners and are decided to be auctioned off. It is said that the reason for the auction is that "public operation" cannot continue (or is not effective), and the income cannot offset the expenditure, resulting in too much loss, so it was decided to publicly auction them in order to obtain some cash to辦辦 other public utilities.</p>
<p>We do not study whether the reason for this is true, and we do not want to ask about the motive for the auction. In short, we are firmly opposed to the sale of publicly owned theaters.</p>
<p>Any advanced country not only has a national theater (located in the capital) but also has publicly owned separate theaters in each city. These theaters are different from the nature of private commercial ventures. Private commercial theaters will do everything possible to make money and profit, which is beyond reproach, while national theaters or publicly owned theaters, in addition to adopting the same business methods in order to use the income to maintain the theater's expenses, also focus on how to strive to use the theater as a public place for educating the public. In other words, the operation of this kind of theater is only a means, and cultural service is the minimum purpose.</p>
<p>Our country has always been unable to establish a national theater due to material constraints, and of course, publicly owned theaters have been even more unable to be established. This time, we were fortunate enough to take over several theaters from the enemy, and they were also beautifully called "publicly owned theaters." Unexpectedly, after less than a few months of operation, they are going to be auctioned off to businessmen again. The local authorities' measures are lacking thorough consideration. We object. As for the fact that the so-called "publicly owned theaters" have not had the slightest "public operation" effect in the past few months, it is not discussed in the final article and will be discussed later. We hope to remind everyone of this matter and ask the wise local authorities to consider it carefully. Re-do!</p>
<h3>China's "Spiritual Food" Famine is Serious</h3>
<p>— Tang Shaohua</p>
<p>According to the survey statistics of the World Food Conference: The entire world is suffering from a serious food shortage, and China's food shortage is the most serious. But in today's Shanghai, I believe that the poverty of spiritual food, which is equally silent as the food shortage, is also very serious. In terms of general cultural publications, although there are some in quantity, there are really too few that can be called spiritual food - pitifully few!</p>
<p>I am closer to the film industry, so I will take the more familiar films as an example. Shanghai is the concentration of Chinese film production, but since the victory, only the Central Film Studio's Second Factory has produced a film called "The House of Loyalty and Righteousness" with great effort. Other companies are still just rumours. This kind of output is too small. There are more than 40 cinemas in Shanghai that show movies. Except for a few two or four-wheel cinemas that occasionally show two outdated old domestic films, nearly 40 cinemas regularly show foreign films (95% are American films, and the number of British and Soviet films imported is also not large). I have no intention of excluding foreign films. On the contrary, in terms of films, China is too backward, and we should welcome the supply of excellent foreign films. But the question is whether the content of the films supplied to us by foreigners is excellent? And can it be called "spiritual food"?</p>
<p>From the 1,300 or so American films imported by Shanghai in the nine months since the victory, more than 80% are promoted by pornography or weirdness. This kind of romantic and absurd content is most likely to affect social customs and human relations. The general public in our country is very imitative, especially for foreign bad habits, it is easier to accept, which is a very terrible and serious problem. We are losing a very large amount of foreign exchange every day, every month, and every year, and what we are getting in return is some bad influences that are harmful to our country's society and people, which is really unfair. We would like to appeal to American film producers and distributors, hoping that while relieving the world's food shortage, they will also consider the relief of "spiritual food," especially in China, where the "spiritual food" shortage is the most serious. By the way, we want to formally inform the Chinese big bosses who are in charge of distributing Hollywood films in China that while striving for "business acumen," they should also put their hands on their conscience and plan for their compatriots. We have already spent such a staggering amount of money, hoping to exchange it for a little "spiritual food" that can educate our compatriots!</p>

<h3>How to Appreciate Drama: Mr. Huang Zuolin's Lecture at Shanghai University</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongji</p>
<p>I feel that most of the drama criticism in the current newspapers and magazines focuses on the actors, and does not analyze the acting skills, but only writes some after-viewing feelings, which cannot be regarded as true drama criticism, nor is it a true attitude to appreciate drama. Then how to appreciate drama? It can be divided into three aspects.</p>
<p>Script Aspect: The most important thing affecting drama is the script. If the content of the script is very meaningful, the structure is very compact, and the lines are very beautiful, then it will definitely win the audience's praise during the performance; on the contrary, if the content of the script is empty, the structure is loose, and the lines are vulgar, it will definitely not get satisfactory results. Unfortunately, in the recent drama scene, we can see a trend, that is, the more meaningful the script, the lighter the box office, and the play with gimmicks as the appeal, but there are many "appreciators," which shows the decline in the audience's level, and it can also be said that they do not yet have the ability to appreciate drama.</p>
<p>Acting Aspect: Speaking of acting, it includes the actors' acting talent and their degree of use of body language. The talent that an ordinary actor has can be measured by five methods: that is, whether their ability to imitate, sensitivity, responsiveness, imagination, and attraction can reach the standard? Especially the ability to imitate is the most important. Although it is everyone's instinct, there are differences in degree. A good actor will be freed from the various constraints of geography, climate, social religion, and customs, so that his performance truly reaches the realm of "lifelike"; as for sensitivity, it is also a condition that every artist should have, especially when acting as an actor, it is even more necessary to have a high degree of dramatic sensitivity; responsiveness is a kind of sensitivity on stage, because the actor has to have a close relationship with other actors or stage lighting on stage, and must be able to adapt to the situation, and only paying attention to reciting the lyrics is the most undesirable. I can give an example to prove that, like a certain drama troupe with a long history, their protagonists often act in the middle of the stage, one person steals the show, so that other actors have to turn their backs to the audience to act, and actors who lack responsiveness will eventually be eliminated; also, although an actor has rich life experience, imagination is still indispensable. For example, if the script requires a scene of killing people, and they have no such experience in real life, then the actor's imagination is extremely needed at this time. They can think of the nature of killing an annoying mosquito (this is possible to get life experience). Expanding and expressing it with imagination, it will appear realistic during the performance; finally, it is necessary to mention attraction, which can be divided into two types. For example, Hollywood's selection of talents often only focuses on the appearance of attraction (appearance, physique, etc.), and today's Shanghai drama industry often makes this mistake. In fact, in addition to the appearance of attraction, there is a greater need for internal attraction such as personality and demeanor. As for the use of the actor's body, it refers to the use of the muscles of the face, torso, and limbs. There are often many actors who have no expression on their faces, or their expressions fall into a stereotype, because they only use part of the muscles, and they also need to know how to use inspiration and muscle coordination. I have seen Indian dancers who wear many copper rings on their limbs. They can use any one of the rings to make a sound. The use of this body can be said to be the most beautiful. Of course, the use of voice is also a great factor in "talk" dramas, and it can be used to assist the lack of expression.</p>
<p>Performance Aspect: Most of it is the director's responsibility. The director, in the performance of drama, is not only arranging the position of the actors on the stage, but the most important thing is to help the actors understand and recognize the personality of the characters in the play, but not to teach the actors to do every action. The actors of a dictatorial and autocratic director often cannot give full play to their skills, which affects the effect of the entire drama. Because drama is like a big tree, the actors are the leaves on the tree, and the director is only responsible for supplying nutrients. I think the director should read a script at least three times: the first time is pure appreciation, the second time is careful analysis, and the third time is to criticize and improve. Pay attention to the mood when rehearsing, and once it is hot, a script can be put on the stage for performance.</p>
<p>An audience who can pay attention to the above points is a true drama appreciator.</p>
<p>Drama Appreciation: 1. Script: Playwright. 2. Director. 3. Actor's acting skills: Use of body, Use of voice, Testing of talent: Imitation ability, Sensitivity, Responsiveness, Imagination, Attractiveness.</p>
<h3>Recent Work by Dorothy Lamour</h3>
<p>— Jiang Xinming</p>
<p>"Sarong Girl" Dorothy Lamour should be quite familiar to film fans in Shanghai. Her charming eyelashes and adorable face have left an indelible impression on them. Especially in films like "Hurricane," "Typhoon," and "The Jungle Princess," her swimming and dancing were truly admirable. Since the victory, several of her films have been shown in Shanghai, including "Dixie Dugan," "Rainbow Island," and "Star Spangled Rhythm." Her performance in "Dixie Dugan" was the most critically acclaimed. Despite Marie McDonald's prominence in today's film industry, fans still enjoy Lamour's films, proving that her popularity has not diminished.</p>
<p>This year, Paramount Pictures is releasing two films starring her, which are specially introduced below: (1) "Road to Utopia": It's a huge farce, featuring not only Lamour but also Bing Crosby and Bob Hope. It's the same old team from "Road to Singapore," "Road to Zanzibar," and "Road to Morocco." Today, these three major stars are equally famous. Yet, they continue to collaborate, which is commendable, and this film is truly a rare masterpiece. Although it's being released this year, it was filmed two years ago. The entire film is filled with comical scenes and expressions, interspersed with the singing and dancing of the three stars. It is indeed a top-notch comedy.</p>
<p>(2) "Masquerade in Mexico": Lamour co-stars with Arturo de Córdova, who played the male lead in "Dixie Dugan." In this film, they perform novel dances, accompanied by exquisite South American music. It is directed by the renowned director Mitchell Leisen, whose masterpiece is "Frenchman's Creek."</p>
<h3>Recollections of Wu Yonggang Filming "The Road to National Construction"</h3>
<p>— Guan Yu</p>
<p>The Second Factory of China Film Studio's "Loyal Family" will soon be seen by audiences in this city. This film is the first domestic production since our victorious return. I remember that in the autumn of 1944, the film's director, Wu Yonggang, led a large crew from Chongqing to Guizhou via Guiyang to film "The Road to National Construction." The cast included Hu Die, Wei Heling, Xie Tian, Ye Gao, Fang Bo, and over forty others. The film's content depicted the cooperation between the Han and Miao people in completing a railway that was of great military importance. Unexpectedly, just as this large crew reached its destination and began work, they encountered a military shift within a few days. The factory's people retreated from Hunan to Guangxi, along the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway all the way to Guiding, almost reaching Guiyang. The Guizhou provincial government also issued notices evacuating residents. By the end of November, most of the shops in Guiyang City were closed for business! The crew was in a desperate situation, unable to find cars, with bridges blown up and trains not running. So, they had no choice but to escape on foot! They walked all the way from Guangxi to Guiyang, losing all their clothes and luggage! They carried the "camera" back to Chongqing. Initially, everyone wanted to find transportation, and director Wu Yonggang volunteered to find connections and make arrangements. People were worried that Fang Bo, a very heavy man, wouldn't be able to walk, so they asked him to accompany Wu Yonggang and leave a day earlier. Who knew that the further they retreated, the less likely they were to find a car. Therefore, everyone decided to walk! They had no food to eat along the way and no place to sleep at night. They only slept under trees, using ropes to hang bedsheets on trees to block the dew. For several days, they encountered heavy rain, soaking the bedding. This was around November 20th of the lunar calendar, and the weather was cold. They were exhausted from walking during the day, and when they found a tree to sleep under at night, the wild wind blew, and the ground was cold. As a result, many people fell ill. The director contracted dysentery, plus malaria, and his feet were also blistered. He could only try to wrap his feet in cloth and continue walking, one step at a time, groaning in pain. Sometimes, they were so hungry that they couldn't even get a bowl of boiled water. In this way, they managed to drag themselves to Guiyang. The first thing they did was take a bath, rest for two days, take some medicine, and then find a car back to Chongqing. When he met me, his first words were, "I never thought I would see you again." At this time, his face was yellow and thin, and he didn't even have the strength to walk.</p>
<p>Now that we have won and returned to Shanghai, his first victory film is almost entirely completed. This time, filming "Loyal Family" and his previous experience filming "The Road to National Construction" in Guizhou-Guangxi are worlds apart. Therefore, I feel that the completion of this work is not an easy thing.</p>
<p>Those who have not personally experienced the hardships of filming "The Road to National Construction" cannot know what it tastes like!</p>
<h3>Hollywood Moguls Discuss This Year's Film Industry Trends</h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>Darryl Zanuck (20th Century Fox): "The future of the film industry will inevitably move towards globalization. Hollywood is preparing to establish branches in both the Eastern and Western hemispheres to produce and promote various films that promote the American democratic spirit."</p>
<p>Hal Wallis (Paramount): "The most important task for this year's film industry is to discover new stars; because the average number of films that ordinary red stars make in a year is very limited; in other words, if you are just starting out and hoping to enter Hollywood, this year is the best opportunity."</p>
<p>Jack L. Warner (Warner Bros.): "During this war, many new weapons were discovered not only on the battlefield, but also a new era has entered the screen. Whether viewed from a scientific or artistic perspective, future developments are unpredictable."</p>
<p>N.J. Blumberg (Universal): "Just as some people now hope that the future world will be 'one family under heaven,' we in the film business also hope to take our work on the same path."</p>
<p>Harry Cohn (Columbia): "The film industry has indeed made a lot of progress in technology in the last ten years. However, in addition to technical issues, what is more important for today's films is that the themes and content of the films we make should capture the attention of audiences around the world."</p>

<h3>Stage and Literature</h3>
<p>— Li Jianwu</p>
<p>Seventeenth-Century France</p>
<p>Seventeenth-century France was a remarkable era. Classical literature reached its zenith during this time. Just in the theater alone, Corneille, Racine, and Molière, whether tragedy or comedy, all became shining examples for later generations to emulate. Molière, in particular, is almost as famous in China as a Chinese playwright.</p>
<p>Their status in literary history is so high that almost every play became a masterpiece. However, this is from the perspective of literary value. If we discard the flowery language of the academy and take the actual stage performances of the time as the standard, it's a completely opposite situation. It's almost laughable that hardly any masterpiece was embraced by the audience. Some of Molière's masterpieces simply failed. Those famous works that we hear our teachers extolling in the classroom, just to give a few examples, were only performed four or five times before quietly disappearing.</p>
<p>Take Molière, for example. "The Miser" is so popular that it has been adapted several times in China. Cao Yu has a script called "Money Madness," and Yuan Zhongyi has a script called "Gold Obsession." But at the time, it completely collapsed. Meredith calls "The Misanthrope" the peak of high comedy, and there have always been translations of it in China. At the time, it also made Molière lose face. Two other masterpieces by Molière, "Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme" and "Les Femmes Savantes," suffered the same fate as "The Miser."</p>
<p>I'm not mentioning Racine here, the great tragic playwright revered by poets. His famous "Phèdre" has a Greek story, but the human nature is modern. Our "Thunderstorm" is such a story, a stepmother loving her stepson. I mean, his "Phèdre" also failed to win the audience's favor at the time. Several other masterpieces of his did not win him any honor. Corneille, the father of French tragedy, was not much better than his younger peers. He sometimes stumbled in their hands. It was truly tragic.</p>
<p>So who succeeded? Corneille had a brother who also occasionally wrote plays. Once, he took a story from a popular novel and adapted it into a tragedy, creating the highest record on the seventeenth-century stage. It was performed a full eighty times, equivalent to three or four hundred times today. Only when the actors were tired of performing did they voluntarily stop. The name was "Timocrate." That popularity can be compared to "Autumn Begonia," which was also adapted from a popular novel.</p>
<p>The highest record for comedy was also not taken by Molière. His masterpieces earned him the lowest record, never the highest. So who succeeded in this area? Again, it was a non-canonical figure named Boursault. He wrote a comedy with a very beautiful title, called "The Comedy Without a Title," which was performed a full sixty-two times and then replayed until it was exiled in the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>Of course, Molière also had a few successes, such as "The Imaginary Invalid," which was performed forty-two times. "The Flying Doctor" also reached forty times. But compared to those victors, his old brand was truly smashed.</p>
<p>After reading these facts, we must have a great feeling. Is there really a chasm between stage value and literary value? Is there really no connection between audiences and readers? Or does time accumulate, and is there no fixed standard for right and wrong? This is a fun question, and I don't want to be long-winded. Perhaps some people think I'm deliberately making excuses for cold plays.</p>
<h3>The Success of a Sculptor</h3>
<p>— Zhang Chongren</p>
<p>The great French sculptor Rodin said, "The people who are active in moving around are by no means stupid." This is what he said when referring to the many sculptors who competed with him at the time. "If you want to compete with these people, you must at least waste as much time as they do." "However, if they could put more effort into the sculpture studio, they would definitely have more beautiful productions." Rodin participated in many competitions for great human statues, but he was almost always unsuccessful. His statue of the poet Victor Hugo and the writer Balzac, which are now immortal masterpieces of sculpture, were both kicked out by ignorant judges in the statue competitions. The statues that were selected and erected at the time were mostly mediocre and uninteresting, unrecorded in history books, unmentioned in the art world, standing on streets and roads, sometimes moved from important locations to secondary intersections, and after a while moved from secondary intersections to cold corners of walls and gardens, regrettable to destroy, useless to keep, becoming redundant on the city's appearance, and finally forgotten. However, Rodin's creations were first unused by people and placed in the depths of the studio, and were finally excavated by people for admiration for all ages, and there is a reason for this.</p>
<p>I admired the works of the great German sculptor Letterer in Berlin. Letterer was the most famous sculptor in contemporary Germany. The Chinese Embassy issued me a letter of introduction, and I was able to visit him. When the door opened, large and small plaster statues stood in groups. I asked where the master was, and one of the statues moved. It was Letterer wearing a pure white work uniform walking out of the statue group with a kind face and a casual attitude. He shook my hand and said, "Do Eastern artists also like my works?" We didn't say polite things and directly talked about various aspects of sculpture art. He put forward many of his views on sculpture art, which were very profound and unique. He put a lot of effort into the block and constant points. When I was in Berlin, I went to visit him every three or five days, always in his sculpture studio. He was kneading clay and talking to me at the same time. I was afraid of disturbing his work, so in my second meeting with him, I told him that I requested that he teach me when he was not working. He said, "I spend my whole time in the sculpture studio and rarely go out. It is most convenient for you to find me in the sculpture studio. I rarely leave traces in other places." I realized the factors that made Letterer so successful.</p>
<p>In 1931, I went from France to Belgium and entered the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, knowing that Lomba and Rosa were the two major sculptors in Belgium. Lomba was known for his masculinity, and Rosa for his softness, and their names shook all of Europe. The British government wanted to purchase modern sculptures from Belgium to enrich his art museum, so he purchased Lomba's marble statue "First Dynasty" and displayed it in the Teate Gallerie Art Museum in London, as the representative work of contemporary Belgian sculpture. The following year, I was able to study sculpture with Professor Lomba. He taught me things about the continuity of surfaces and lines, the starting and ending points of forces, the competition between concavity, convexity, light and shadow, the flexible use of the center of gravity, etc., that could not be heard from other artists or read in books. You can see it in his sculptures, but you need a considerable level of understanding. He was most impatient, and students who were slightly negligent in their practice would be scolded out of the door. When Belgian Emperor Albert died and the new Emperor Leopold ascended the throne, all the Belgian sculptors went to contact him, hoping to carve a statue of the new Emperor and Empress in the palace. Only Lomba buried himself in the sculpture studio and did not go. The new Emperor sent someone to invite Lomba, and Lomba agreed to make a statue for him, but he refused to work in the palace. He said, "The palace has too many rules and is too restrictive. Please have Your Majesty come to the sculpture studio." So the new Emperor brought his guards to Lomba's sculpture studio for an hour every day until the clay sculpture was completed. A writer who is buried in his work will not be buried.</p>
<p>One day, I mistakenly wore leather shoes and rushed into the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, climbing the stairs to practice clay sculpture. The students said: I was embarrassed and smiled. I didn't know why. A classmate came close to my ear and said, "You mistakenly wore leather shoes, and people are laughing at you." I looked down and blushed and couldn't lift my head. This was such an embarrassing thing. I am a Chinese, and my clothes are so disheveled in front of foreigners. The students kindly told me, "It's okay in itself, but in our European customs, no one wears mandarin duck shoes." I then declared, "We Chinese don't either. I was confused myself." The door rang and Professor Lomba came in, and everyone laughed. Lomba asked why they were laughing and I was even more embarrassed. I walked up to the teacher and explained: "I practice sculpture with Maria every night and come home late and tired. I take off my shoes at will, and this morning it was raining and dark, so I wore the wrong shoes. Don't blame the students for laughing. I am laughing at myself too." Lomba said: "This is nothing strange. I have forgotten to tie my tie and entered the art academy more than once. You can ask the students." So everyone laughed again. Lomba continued: "When you use all your brainpower on work, you often can't take care of those trivial things." The following year, in the sculpture competition, I was lucky enough to win the first prize and win the Belgian Emperor's Gold Medal. Lomba said to the contestants in a humorous tone: "Today you see, the one wearing mandarin duck shoes ran to the front." I said: "I was lucky to win the first prize, because I knew that three or four people's styles were better than mine, and I often asked them for advice. However, in this competition, they were probably a little nervous. Because I knew that I had no hope of winning the prize, I settled down to work, so I was lucky enough to win the first prize." Lomba smiled in his rich white beard and said: "Chinese people pay attention to politeness and humility, which is also the attitude that artists should have." The contestants gathered around and took my arms and asked me to treat him to coffee, and asked for a glass of beer each. Tomorrow morning, the model will change her posture, and we will plunge into the tense atmosphere of work again. Sculpture, a three-dimensional art, is viewed from all sides, occupies space, the rotation of lines, the constant competition of blocks, the sense of volume inside, the tactile sensation of the surface, posture, movement, meaning, implication, ... etc., many, many conditions, and practicing in a very limited time cannot solve them. Speaking of sculpture, bronze and marble are completely different techniques, so every great sculptor laments that the length of human life is too short to complete their ideals. Kneading clay for three to five years, doing nothing and being busy for a while, and spending most of the day on things other than making, will not achieve anything. The unanimous conclusion of the masters is that sculpture, an art, requires extremely mature skills for the difficulties of tools and materials, and genius alone is not enough. But to develop these skills, you need years of continuous practice, but this refers to sculptures with artistic value, otherwise it doesn't matter if you just knead a few shapes. Students of Western painting have all studied sculpture for one or two years, and children of five or six years old can make a round ball or even a dog when they hold mud.</p>
<h3>Memories of Rongcheng (Chengdu)</h3>
<p>— Liu Dajie</p>
<p>I lived in Chengdu for more than two years, and what I loved most was the spring there. At that time, I wrote dozens of poems praising the spring in Chengdu, but they have all been lost. The Hundred Flower Pond, the Thatched Cottage Temple, Xue Tao Well, and the Wangjiang Tower – those beautiful places are unforgettable to this day. I often thought of writing something to preserve those scenes, but I am always caught up in a busy and impoverished life, hardly able to relax my mind for a moment. Today, I will write down a little of it, but it will only sketch out a small outline.</p>
<p>The weather in Chengdu is never too hot when it's hot, nor too cold when it's cold. There's plenty of moisture, and the weather is unpredictable, which is suitable for growing flowers and trees, but not for raising people. Therefore, people who live in Chengdu don't have good complexions, but the flowers and trees are all thriving. Fine plum blossoms, which are not easily seen in the areas around Beiping and Jiangnan, can be found in Chengdu. Magnolias measuring three or four zhang (about 10-13 meters), and oleanders two or three zhang high, which are not seen outside, can also be found in Chengdu. According to a botanical expert, there are more than 270 species of orchids in Chengdu. Orchids, which are treasured outside, are truly everywhere in Chengdu, as cheap as rapeseed flowers in the Jiangnan area. Before the war of resistance, a large bunch could be bought for three cents. Friends who come from outside invariably complain about the Chengdu weather, but no one dislikes the flowers and trees of Chengdu.</p>
<p>The city of Chengdu has a hint of the Beijing style. Planting flowers and bamboo, enjoying wine and tea, occupies an important part of life. Even a poor person's house has several flowers and trees in the courtyard, blooming with bright flowers throughout the year, adorning the lovely greenery. They all know how to cultivate them, and how to arrange them artfully. Red plum blossoms are set off by small bamboos, and orange trees are planted near roses. This kind of arrangement and support shows harmony and avoids monotony.</p>
<p>The spring in Chengdu probably starts more than a month earlier than in Beiping. From mid-February to mid-March is the time when plum blossoms are in full bloom. The color of plum blossoms is everywhere, in the streets and alleys, in the courtyards and between walls. Green plum blossoms are superior for their freshness, cinnabar plum blossoms for their vibrancy, and pink plum blossoms are not of high quality, but most of what you see in the Plum Garden of Wuxi and Deng Wei's place in Suzhou are this type of pink plum blossom. "Sparse shadows slant across the clear, shallow water, a faint fragrance floats in the dusk" – Lin Hejing's poem is truly well-written. I wonder if the many fine plum blossoms in Chengdu have ever seen it? Emerald green, snow white, pink, deep red – various colors are coordinated appropriately and naturally, truly worthy of the three characters "Sea of Fragrant Snow."</p>
<p>By the end of February and March, plum blossoms and orchids have already passed their prime. Replacing them is a lively scene of crabapples, magnolias, peaches, apricots, pears, plums, and winter jasmine, all kinds of flowers and trees competing for beauty. Willows have already trailed their soft, charming branches, swaying gently by the waters of the Hundred Flower Pond and Huanhua Stream. Large birds and small sparrows, with beautiful colors whose names I do not know, fly back and forth, singing songs. Xue Tao Well Park is also full of spring, with old poets strolling there, some playing the xiao (vertical flute) and singing songs, some fishing and playing the zheng (zither). That kind of sentiment is completely different from the scenery on West Lake.</p>
<p>The Flower Festival is the day the Chengdu flower market opens. The location is the Qingyang Taoist Temple outside the Twelve Bridges in the south gate. The flower market lasts for a month. This is a time of liberation for young men and women in Chengdu. The flower market is somewhat similar to the Bathing the Buddha Festival in Shanghai, but in Chengdu, it mainly focuses on selling flowers, supplemented by various amusements and local products from various places. Normally, we don't easily see women in gorgeous attire on the streets. At this time, the people of Chengdu come out in droves to sell flowers, sell flowers, look at people, and be looked at. Shoulder to shoulder, they are truly crowded beyond belief. Embroidered shoes, lace pants, peach-colored clothes, curly hair – colorful and bizarre, everything is there. It's less of a flower market and more of an exhibition of the people of Chengdu. It's as if the people of Chengdu, who have been cooped up for a year, want to take this opportunity to let loose. Those who are drunk are very drunk, those who are rowdy are very rowdy, and the happiest are the children, holding windmills and pinwheels, chewing candy in their mouths, singing and shouting. Thinking of the poet's line "No one returns without having seen the flowers," it is truly the most appropriate thing to say.</p>
<p>Going for a walk to the Hundred Flower Pond, the scene is also extremely beautiful. Across from it is the Thatched Cottage of Du Fu. A pair of ferries with canopies are always ready there. You wave your hand, and they will come to take you across. The water in the pond is so clear that it is strangely lovable. You can see the swimming fish in the shallow water very clearly. No matter when you go, there is always a group of people fishing there. Regardless of whether there are fish or not, they can patiently sit there, chatting and laughing, only returning to the city in groups at dusk. A dozen large willow trees on the embankment hang their newly green branches, the tips brushing the water's surface. When the breeze passes, they stir up beautiful ripples on the water.</p>
<p>When you have nothing to do, you can sit in a teahouse. Teahouses are truly everywhere in Chengdu. A bamboo chair, a makeshift wooden table – you can brew a bowl of tea and sit for an afternoon. There, you can see many things you don't usually see. Some sell calligraphy and paintings, some sell prints, some sell old clothes. Sometimes, you can buy some very good items for the least amount of money. Some teahouses in the suburbs are by the river, some are under flowers and trees. You can sit there, drink tea, eat peanuts, and leisurely appreciate nature, or read a book, or sleep – you will be very comfortable. If you get excited, you can also order one or two dishes and half a catty of wine, and get thoroughly drunk. Sitting in a rickshaw back to the city, all you feel is relaxation and leisure. You won't feel the kind of tense atmosphere that exists in outside cities at all. I often think that if a person lives in Chengdu for too long, they will become a lazy person, a lazy person who just gets by.</p>
<h3>Night</h3>
<p>— Fei Cun</p>
<p>Night once again compels people to contemplate:</p>
<p>The eternal mystery within the black curtain.</p>
<p>"Quietude and sweetness,"</p>
<p>Say a pair of lovers on their pillows.</p>
<p>A child says timidly:</p>
<p>"You hide a green-eyed cat demon,</p>
<p>It transforms into an old woman sucking our brains;</p>
<p>And a long-tongued, red-haired hanged woman,</p>
<p>Leaps from an old tree in the wilderness</p>
<p>To the dreams of those who sleep alone."</p>
<p>A debauched libertine suffers,</p>
<p>Saying: Night is a glistening mirror,</p>
<p>Reflecting the maggots wriggling in his heart.</p>
<p>An old woman in an ancient house sobs:</p>
<p>"Ah, night, you are the most lingering</p>
<p>And touching epitaph,</p>
<p>Bringing the smile of the deceased to our pillows,</p>
<p>To exchange for our desperate and helpless tears."</p>
<h3>Pride and Sorrow</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>Once, I heard a friend sigh with melancholy: "In the past, I had the pride of the solitary, now I only have the sorrow of the solitary." At first, I liked that he said it cleverly, but after further reflection, I knew that besides the words being used in a seemingly reasonable way, the meaning was foolish. In fact, what the solitary person is proud of is nothing but his sorrow, and his sorrow is caused by his pride.</p>
<p>Anyone with a healthy mind will not be proud or sorrowful, because life can never be lonely. In our surroundings – this vast sea of people – there are not a few faces that are not unfamiliar. We have many acquaintances; and even one or two close friends. Yes, that is enough to not be lonely. Can you still blame heaven and man by shouting about loneliness?</p>
<p>In the lonely garden, the pine's steadfastness, the bamboo's humility, and the plum's purity make them the Three Friends of Winter. Chrysanthemums are not incapable of withstanding the cold, but they are too self-admiring. In the garden of friendship, those who are proud and sorrowful are like chrysanthemums. Their loneliness is not caused by the environment, but by their own creation of this special habit. We certainly don't need "thousands of reds and purples," but excessive "self-admiration" is not a good thing.</p>
<p>Don't you believe me?</p>
<p>Tolstoy died, and Gorky recalled him: "When this man was alive, I was no longer an orphan living alone in the world." Clearly, with Tolstoy, Gorky was not lonely.</p>
<p>Zhuge Liang's Eulogy to Zhou Yu has "... If your spirit is conscious, use it to see my heart, from now on there will be no more kindred spirits in the world..." From this, we understand that although Zhou Yu had made things difficult for him several times, Zhuge Liang cried for his kindred spirit with sincere tears, because with Zhou Yu around, Zhuge Liang did not feel lonely. He hoped that kindred spirits would live forever, and would rather his enemies not die.</p>
<p>Such a great Gorky, such an extremely intelligent Zhuge Liang, and they had times when they were not lonely. Could it be that it is even more difficult for us to encounter one or two friends we like? Could it be that you have never shed tears because of a sincere letter or a few heartfelt words? Could it be that you have never been moved by some lovely things? Could it be that in your memory, there are really no shadows that you can cherish for life?</p>
<p>The heroes who travel the world know that "going out depends on friends." In the greenwood, the emphasis is on generosity and righteousness. In the dust of a foreign land, even if Han is not familiar, once they meet by chance, they will laugh loudly and shout, "All within the four seas are brothers." After a few words, they swear an oath over a handful of earth and become sworn brothers. What is more heartwarming than this in the world? If "love at first sight" is a predestined relationship from a previous life, then how could "feeling like old friends at first meeting" not be a good fortune from three lifetimes? I always yearn for the friendship of "why must we have known each other before we meet?"</p>
<p>Do you still want to say you are lonely? Then, dear, think about the old saying! "This world is a mirror, if you smile at it, it will smile back at you; if you cry, the mirror will also cry." I don't dare to scold you for being self-righteous, but I am thinking, imagine you are so aloof and incompatible that it is difficult for people to approach you. Actually, instead of spending too much time thinking about yourself, why not appreciate others a little? You will be happy, if you are willing.</p>
<p>Those lonely people, I call them "pitiful people who are proud and sorrowful." They have cleverly climbed up a high and unmanned dangerous building, looked around, but then inexplicably shouted: "Loneliness! This world has abandoned me." Who knows if it is the world that has abandoned him? Or has he abandoned this world?</p>
<p>Friendship has painted this world with pleasing colors. If there are no friends, then what is the use of these mountains, this blue sky, the magnificent sunset, poetry and painting, and elegant musical movements?</p>
<p>Life is friendship.</p>
<h3>Morning Glow</h3>
<p>— Sudan</p>
<p>Look, how bright and beautiful it is! That faintly red morning glow.</p>
<p>Why are you ignoring me?</p>
<p>Ah! Why aren't you speaking? Are you afraid of startling the March seasonal wind?</p>
<p>What's wrong? You're crying! Child, don't be like this, why are you crying? Don't you know that crying is a disgrace? You should be strong, wipe away your tears! Are you cherishing the parting? Or are you afraid of the long road ahead?</p>
<p>You are still young! Be brave, brave the hardships, be a traveler in the world, taste some of the morning wind and night dew! Let me tell you, now, the green grass of Jiangnan has withered.</p>
<p>Why are you sighing so sadly again? Are you sighing that the dream of a distant sail is bleak? Don't be like this, don't shrink your feelings so heavily, smile lightly! Think more about happy things, parting is not so sad, and you will reunite soon!</p>
<p>Although I have a broken voice, let me sing a song of praise to welcome the spring for you, to send you off.</p>
<p>Are you still hesitating? You say, what are you attached to? Nothing? That's great! Raise your head, don't look timid, young people should stand tall and walk with big steps.</p>
<p>Let us shake hands tightly one more time, don't hesitate, take advantage of this dawn, when the morning glow is still brilliant, start your journey! I hope you will have a bountiful harvest.</p>
<p>Okay, go! Take care!</p>
<p>Distant traveler, ah! May your life always be the morning glow, brilliant.</p>
<h3>Flying Together (42)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>(10)</p>
<p>Shi Yulou privately hired a qin player. Like the Four Great Dan actresses, he had his own tuning. If it wasn't a familiar qin player, it was difficult to cooperate with him. And the success of a performing actress, thirty percent depends on the help of the qin player. So, the relationship between a qin player and a performing actress is very important. Qin players rely on performing actresses for food, and performing actresses cannot perform without qin players. In general, performing actresses in ancient and modern times respect qin players. Moreover, often a performing actress's skills are taught by her qin player. Because a qin player can also sing many opera excerpts, otherwise, he would not be able to accompany the performing actress.</p>
<p>Shi Yulou's qin player only started working with her after she came to Beijing. This qin player's name is Zhang Xian, and he is very young, only twenty-four or five years old. He has a pair of triangular eyes, and always looks at people with a bit of deviousness. He has a hooked nose and a square mouth. Even without speaking, he makes you feel a little afraid of him. But although his appearance is not very presentable, he has talent. His qin skills are said to be no less skillful than the qin player of Mei Lanfang. He has also read some books and can write opera excerpts. Therefore, he is very self-important and also very proud. He not only accompanies Shi Yulou, but also often corrects Shi Yulou's errors in the wording of opera excerpts. So Shi Yulou gives him a large salary, almost taking up half of Shi Yulou's monthly earnings. Despite this, he is not satisfied. He often threatens Shi Yulou, saying: "Being a qin player doesn't make as much money as teaching opera. If I take in three or five apprentices, I can earn a hundred and eighty strings of cash a month." But now, he can only get a salary of forty strings of cash a month. Forty strings of cash is definitely not much for him, because his expenses are quite high: eating, drinking, whoring, gambling, he does it all. It is said that this is also a way to show off his talent.</p>
<p>Shi Yulou was panicking because of this threat. Coincidentally, Mrs. Mo was willing to let Lihua learn opera, and Second Mrs. Weng was also willing to let Liyun learn opera. This was truly an opportunity that fell from the sky! Shi Yulou's taking in apprentices is fake, he is only helping Zhang Xian drum up business, so that he can control Zhang Xian.</p>
<p>When Zhang Xian heard this news, his heart blossomed with joy! Now he can be said to have achieved two things at once. On one hand, he continues to work as a qin player, and on the other hand, he takes in apprentices. He is very grateful to Shi Yulou for his consideration. In order to repay Shi Yulou for this favor, he humbly conceded on the tuition very politely. He was only willing to charge twenty strings of cash a month for both Lihua and Liyun. But it was agreed that gifts must be sent on the three major holidays of the year as usual. Also, after they officially go on stage, he would be given twenty percent of their monthly earnings, which is called a pension, for a period of ten years. Shi Yulou discussed these conditions with Mrs. Mo and Second Mrs. Weng. Mrs. Mo did not understand the rules of this industry, so she could only let them say whatever they wanted and agreed to everything. And Second Mrs. Weng, although she understood, only complied with everything in order to please Shi Yulou. When Zhang Xian saw that this deal was done, he chose an auspicious day to hold the apprenticeship ceremony.</p>
<p>The ceremony was held in Shi Yulou's room. Mrs. Mo bought some gifts for Zhang Xian beforehand. Shi Yulou hosted the banquet on this day, and he explained that another purpose was to welcome Mrs. Mo.</p>
<p>Lihua and Liyun were like two small puppets, at the mercy of the adults. First, they kowtowed to the patriarch of the pear garden, and then they kowtowed to Zhang Xian. Temporarily, Zhang Xian also asked them to kowtow to Shi Yulou, because Shi Yulou's assistance was needed to teach skills, because it was more convenient for Shi Yulou to teach while he was performing.</p>
<p>The room was brightly lit, and filled with guests, like a scene from the New Year. After the ceremony was over, everyone praised Lihua for being beautiful. Everyone estimated that Lihua's appearance on stage would definitely be beautiful and she would definitely become popular. Because the point of being on stage is to be visually appealing. So it was decided at that time to make Lihua a Qingyi Huashan actress, and Chenyun a bearded actor. Firstly, it was imagined that Chenyun would look very suitable with a beard; secondly, they could also work together in the future. Hearing these words made Mrs. Mo's heart itch, as if her daughter was about to turn into a money tree. She never thought her luck in her old age would be reflected in her daughter! Zhang Xian was also very happy. He thought: As long as the apprentice has hope and can become popular, he doesn't have to worry about the price. Moreover, he really liked Lihua.</p>
<p>Lihua was very bewildered at this time. She didn't know that at this time she had become the financial pillar in the minds of two people! But she only felt that these people did not have good intentions towards her. Quietly leaving them, she returned to her room, (now, Mrs. Mo also lives in this apartment,) closed the door, and for some reason, a wave of sadness surged up and she couldn't help but lie on the bed and cry! She resented that Mrs. Mo had once promised her to come to Beijing to let her study, but now it was just a lie! So at this time, she deeply missed Mr. Mo, missed the education that Mr. Mo had given her in her childhood, and also missed Binling. She regretted not learning Binling, and insisted on staying at home! She remembered that Mr. Mo was often angry with Mrs. Mo for watching opera. She instinctively realized that "opera" was not a good thing, but she was forced by Mrs. Mo to learn opera! She was so sorry to Mr. Mo! She always believed that Mr. Mo was right, because Mr. Mo was knowledgeable. But Mr. Mo was gone, so she could only follow Mrs. Mo on the wrong path, or even on the bad path! Although she was unwilling, she had no choice but to obey Mrs. Mo, she was her mother! Therefore, Mrs. Mo had the right to dispose of her at will. Perhaps Mrs. Mo was well-intentioned, but this goodwill was wrong! She knew these things, but didn't know how to escape this terrible future? Her fragile little heart began to tremble!</p>
<p>Liyun happily knocked on the door and came in. Lihua simply didn't open it, no matter how loud Liyun shouted, she ignored her! Because she was a little angry at Liyun at this moment. She was angry that she was so happy! She was angry that she couldn't help or comfort herself at all!</p>

<h3>Beheading</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Who is it that deprives us of rice?</p>
<p>Unlawful grain merchants, corrupt grain officials.</p>
<p>They manipulate, raise prices, hoard, speculate, making rice prices soar, making rice gradually scarce in the market, making us eat expensive rice, making us unable to afford high prices to buy rice, so that we have no rice to eat.</p>
<p>It is they who want the lives of millions of people in our city. Not "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth," for the sake of survival, most of us have reason to take the lives of a few of them.</p>
<p>It has now been found that there is a suspect in the unlawful use of grain loans, namely the manager of San Tai Rice Shop, Wu Rongsheng, and the manager of Wu Chang Rice Shop, Rong Yongming. If the evidence is conclusive and the above-mentioned circumstances are true, the citizens of our city have the right to demand that the authorities impose severe penalties to warn other illegal grain merchants and corrupt grain officials:</p>
<p>The method of beheading and public display may be too barbaric, but is the method of letting us starve to death considered civilized?</p>
<p>In times of chaos, use heavy penalties. This chaotic Shanghai is simply not like a world. After one or two heads fall to the ground, the air may be a little clearer.</p>
<h3>Sun Dianying and Pang Bingxun</h3>
<p>— Willow Catkins</p>
<p>Forward</p>
<p>Sun Dianying and Pang Bingxun are probably not unfamiliar to many Chinese people, especially those in the Yellow River basin. Their "achievements" and "careers" have constantly and directly or indirectly brought disaster to our people, thus arousing our deep attention and concern. Mr. Sun's "Tomb Raiding of the Eastern Mausoleums" and "Struggle for Suiyuan," and Mr. Pang's participation in the Battle of Taierzhuang and capture in the Taihang Mountains, were all vivid and dramatic performances. Although the events have passed, their echoes still linger, making people wonder what kind of roles they really were. "Greenwood Heroes," "National Traitors," "Meritorious Officials," "Han Traitors," and "Underground Workers"—they seem to have played them all, and often played them so skillfully and aptly, like versatile actors who are proficient in all roles: male, female, painted-face, clown, and supporting. It is not easy to judge their identities clearly. Fortunately, the facts are all there. As long as we carefully consider them, they can serve as a reference for our conclusions.</p>
<p>Captured? Surrendered?</p>
<p>The Taihang campaign of the summer of the thirty-second year (1943), lasted from April to August, a full five months. The enemy launched four divisions and three brigades, making it a major campaign in terms of duration and strength.</p>
<p>Sun Dianying and Pang Bingxun were both captured in this campaign. While the dates and locations of their capture differed, the circumstances of their capture also varied greatly. First, Sun Dianying was captured in a small village in the Linqu County area. There was no fierce battle beforehand, only a few artillery shells as a prelude. The enemy then easily entered his headquarters, and he surrendered very docilely. According to records in the Taiyuan newspapers, more than three hundred of his staff and guards were captured at the same time. Each person had self-defense equipment of more than three guns—a rifle or light machine gun, a pistol, and two opium pipes. However, they did not waste a single bullet. They all very obediently watched as an enemy lieutenant and chairman approached Sun Dianying and gave him a very respectful salute.</p>
<p>Pang Bingxun was captured near Sanjiaokou, at the intersection of Lingchuan, Huguan, and Lin counties. He was hiding in a mountain cave, a very hidden location that was not easy to find. It is said that Sun Dianying sent his secretary as a guide to search for him. When captured, he had three followers and his son with him. He originally wanted to commit suicide with a pistol, but he probably lacked the courage. His son dissuaded him from doing so, which is a great pity. The distinction between "national traitor" and "meritorious official" rested entirely on that small pistol bullet.</p>
<p>The Fate of the Troops</p>
<p>Sun Dianying's New Fifth Army and Pang Bingxun's Fortieth Army both had extremely strong feudal habits. They centered their faith in the individual and had not entered the ideal state of nationalized armies. Therefore, after Sun Dianying was captured, the New Fifth Army, from privates to high-ranking commanders, all surrendered under the banner of "Harmony and Movement." One regiment after another, one division after another, they went to Xinxiang to register in a planned and orderly fashion.</p>
<p>The situation of the Fortieth Army was different. They had integrity and weight; they were unwilling to be Han traitors and slaves. After Pang Bingxun was captured, the troops, under the command of Deputy Commander Ma Fawu, gradually approached the Twenty-seventh Army in Lingchuan and Huguan and continued to fight fiercely until they received instructions from the central government. Then they crossed south to Luoyang to regroup and train. Not a single officer or soldier made a spontaneous and base surrender. From this point of view, the Fortieth Army was superior to the New Fifth Army, and Pang Bingxun was superior to Sun Dianying. The facts have already told us in great detail, without the need for any superfluous confessions or defenses from them.</p>
<p>Lone-Wolf Drug Dealers</p>
<p>Sun Dianying also did something that wronged the country and the nation. His cadres were all famous drug dealers who used their military status as a cover for drug trafficking, which truly humiliated the country and the nation. We often saw one or two officers and soldiers from the New Fifth Army frequently running between Luoyang and Linqu, always carrying high-quality black goods in their waists. Occasionally, there would be batches of livestock carrying large quantities of opium, red pills, and white powder, openly transported from the Taihang Mountains to Luoyang to absorb legal tender. It seemed that a tacit understanding had been established with the Luoyang command and the river defense troops, and no one ever asked about the trouble from beginning to end!</p>
<p>Why Hide in a Cave?</p>
<p>Pang Bingxun was the commander-in-chief of the Twenty-fourth Army Group, commander of the Fortieth Army, chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, and the highest military commander of the Taihang Mountain Military Region. As such a leading figure, why did he abandon control of the troops and hide alone in a mountain cave when the situation became tense? This enigma has not been factually answered to this day.</p>
<p>It is said that Pang Bingxun was a cripple who limped when he walked and was overweight. Whether marching or fighting, he often needed four people to carry him, otherwise, he could not move an inch. We should know that the Taihang Mountains are not like Shanghai or Nanjing, with smooth and flat asphalt roads. Instead, they are full of narrow mountain paths and steep cliffs. Besides walking, there is no way to accommodate other means of transportation. So he had no choice but to hide in a cave, trying to escape this great disaster.</p>
<p>This explanation may be far-fetched, but there is no other way to explain it. Unless there are other reasons, we cannot make speculative guesses before we obtain the facts. Only God knows the truth.</p>
<p>Not Violating Conscience</p>
<p>In this battle, there were no precise statistics on the number of officers and soldiers captured. We can only use "many" to represent this question. Sun Dianying and Pang Bingxun set up reception centers in Xinxiang, specializing in accommodating the scattered officers and soldiers of the Twenty-fourth Army Group and receiving prisoners led over by the enemy. They were not entirely devoid of conscience. As long as you were unwilling to join the enemy, they would generously help you cross to the south. Even if large units broke through and returned, they could provide convenience as long as the facts allowed. The Eighth Column and part of the Forty-fifth Division, with more than a thousand soldiers, broke out of the enemy's multiple encirclements in a roundabout way. Sun Dianying and Pang Bingxun did provide some minor assistance on the side.</p>

<h3>Aristocratic Cafe - Ten Thousand Dollars Per Cup of Coffee</h3>
<p>— Feng Rao</p>
<p>Amidst the economic downturn, cafes continue to stand tall without any sign of decline. It is said that there are currently seventy or eighty cafes in Shanghai. Several more are said to be opening soon, including an "absolutely aristocratic" cafe on Chengdu Road. It is said that the price of each cup of coffee is set at ten thousand dollars. It was originally intended to be named "Aristocratic Cafe," but because the word "aristocratic" was too provocative, there is talk of changing the name to "Sino-American." According to people in the industry, "Shanghainese people like to eat and drink; an expensive price can attract attention." This can be said to reveal the vanity of Shanghainese people in one sentence.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the background of "Sino-American" is the "Four Sisters," and the decoration costs alone amount to one hundred million dollars. How can the public not be ashamed of these young ladies' boldness! The saying "Comparing people makes you mad" is indeed a wise saying.</p>
<p>The city's brothel registration has been approved for more than six hundred, but only two hundred prostitutes have passed the examination. In this proportion, will prostitutes inevitably have to work in several brothels in the future? It is unknown how the authorities will deal with those who are "unqualified."</p>
<p>It has recently been learned that in Hankou Concession, there are many all-night dance halls, and the scenery is no less than that of Shanghai. Recently, the authorities have formulated measures stipulating that female dancers must be at least eighteen years old to operate, and those who are seventeen years old will be ordered to change careers. It is expected that Hankou dance hall girls will "forever be eighteen years old" without a doubt. But the most puzzling thing is, what is the "big difference" between eighteen and seventeen years old?</p>
<h3>Wang Yunwu Used to Pull Rickshaws</h3>
<p>— Yu Qian</p>
<p>Wang Yunwu is now the Minister of Economic Affairs.</p>
<p>This gentleman is large in stature and loud in voice. Every time he attends a meeting of the Political Council, his words often shock the audience, much like a painted-face singer in Peking opera. Some people regard him and Wang Xiaozai as the standard loud voices of the two Wangs in the Political Council.</p>
<p>He has done a good job in presiding over the Commercial Press. In Chongqing, he lived in the branch of the Commercial Press on Baixiang Street in the lower half of the city. He used an umbrella and walked to and from the city, like a comrade of Wu Zhihui.</p>
<p>Someone once talked to him about the secret to success in life and work. He had an analogy, he said: "I seem to be pulling a rickshaw in Chongqing. When walking uphill, I try my best to pull upward with all my strength; when walking downhill, I try to be slow, hold the handlebars steady, step by step, without panic."</p>
<p>Everyone may wish to think carefully about this principle.</p>
<h3>Church Satire</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>There is a church in Shanghai, and its location is ironic. You say: Which church is this? Where is it located? (Answer in tomorrow's edition)</p>
<h3>Don't Be Perfunctory</h3>
<p>— Xu Yulin</p>
<p>There is a Chinese saying: "A day-laboring monk strikes the day's bell." This sentence describes people who live a perfunctory life. Currently, most of the large companies, manufacturers, and even municipal agencies in this city are presenting a perfunctory situation. People are perfunctory in human relations, and they are also perfunctory in official affairs. Because everyone is perfunctory to each other, everyone holds an attitude of just getting by. The impact directly reduces administrative efficiency or stagnates the business of manufacturers, and indirectly causes national weakness and social depression. Whether it is a public institution or a commercial factory, if the staff all hold a perfunctory mentality, it is equivalent to everyone not cooperating. I would like to ask, if a factory, if the factory director and employees are all perfunctory to each other, can they still achieve the ideal of reducing costs and improving products? Similarly, a local agency, if everyone likes to be perfunctory and is unwilling to cooperate sincerely with one heart and one mind, don't even think about promoting local administrative efficiency.</p>
<p>So I think that now to solve the country's problems and eliminate local insecurity, one thing is very important, that is, we should eliminate the perfunctory atmosphere in society, so that administrative efficiency can be improved, and industry and commerce can achieve practical development. This will enable our motherland to keep pace with the major powers.</p>

<h3>Red Tassel Hat</h3>
<p>— De Ping</p>
<p>The police have changed into grass-green summer uniforms.</p>
<p>I remember the "Shanghai Yi Field Scenery" of the twentieth year of Guangxu (1894) said:</p>
<p>"The police set up by the Municipal Council are half Westerners and half Chinese. The Chinese are guaranteed by those with occupations, and their clothes have Chinese and Western numbers. There are Chinese and Western numbers in the left and right circles, so that people can easily identify them. They are divided into sections to patrol the streets, and they hang dark lights around their waists at night. Western police officers carry knives, and Chinese police officers hold batons, patrolling all night long."</p>
<p>The re-edition of "Shanghai Tourist Guide" in the twelfth year of the Republic of China (1923) has the following records:</p>
<p>"In the past, Shanghai Chinese police officers wore ordinary people's clothes and melon-skin hats, but there were two white lines embroidered in circles on the front of their short clothes, which were the Chinese and Western characters of the serial number."</p>
<p>"Later, they changed to wearing red tassel hats with the front cut, and cool hats in summer. There were shiny copper buttons on the chest, a lacquered leather belt around the waist, white socks in summer and black boots in winter, which seemed majestic. Until recently, they wore leather boots and military hats, and there was no distinction, and the situation was the same as that of soldiers. The hats worn by today's Chinese police officers are the same as those worn by Western police officers in the past. Thirty years ago, Western police officers changed to wearing copper hat styles, which have not been changed to this day."</p>
<p>Now, when I think back to a red tassel hat swaying on the streets of Nanjing Road, what a scene it was.</p>
<h3>Flesh Transplantation</h3>
<p>— Gang Ren</p>
<p>All diseases are the great enemies of mankind. They destroy people's bodies, eliminate people's lives, and there are many incurable diseases. But human scientists and medical scientists are not afraid, and with their fearless spirit, they are committed to overcoming diseases and rescuing humanity, step by step.</p>
<p>The International Medical Union—the American Rockefeller Foundation—in its most recent report, in addition to reporting on the past year's research on overcoming various diseases such as typhus, malaria, yellow fever, and tuberculosis, also suggested organizing an international medical union to jointly study various airborne infectious diseases, promoting the work of prevention and elimination; on the one hand, using the convenience and speed of air transport to replace the old-fashioned passive methods of abandoned seaport quarantine.</p>
<p>Gospel for the Blind—The New York Hospital in the United States recently united with its nearby nineteen hospitals to organize the establishment of an "Eye Bank." It stores live cornea—the transparent body that covers the eye; it is stored in a closed container with hot and cold equipment, and the container is filled with special medicines. It is prepared for those who have been blinded by fire, viruses, and other damaged corneas, as a means of regaining sight, because those people's other parts, such as the nervous retina, are all complete. Although the work of "eye transplantation" was discovered long ago, its formal and large-scale application is still for the first time.</p>
<p>When the deceased has given his life or the legal person has given permission, the cornea of the deceased can be removed and maintained within four hours; babies who are born and die are also "donors"; and people with incurable blindness can also contribute their perfect cornea. Now, with this method, one out of five blind people can regain their sight.</p>
<p>New Uses for Milk—Milk will be an important and valuable raw material in the chemical industry of the future; American scientists have extracted many kinds of products from it: such as anesthetics, pigments, rubber, and flexible glass. Various extremely useful drugs can be extracted from milk whey, such as the famous "penicillin," a bactericidal anesthetic, and a kind of lactic acid, which is used to make the blood after severe trauma or surgery, and other special military drugs, which, if used in peacetime, will equally increase human happiness.</p>
<p>New "Meat" Transplantation—The American Red Cross has made people's "blood transfusions" into plasma for wartime rescue services, and recently there have been improvements, that is, making plasma containing fibrinogen, etc.; the new meat skin transplanted for the wounded, when used for surgery, first soak the plasma liquid, the components automatically promote the adhesion of fibrin, which not only stops bleeding at the same time, but also makes places that surgeons cannot suture, such as between fingers and toes, adhere successfully.</p>
<p>New Drug for Treating Tuberculosis—People have taken another step forward in the work of overcoming tuberculosis. Drs. Miller and Lake discovered another penicillin-related product, chlortetracycline. Although it has not yet been tested on humans, human tuberculosis germs, transplanted into guinea pigs, are 100% fatal, but after injection for several days, although the drug, like penicillin, can only inhibit reproduction and indirectly kill; it has been found that the bacteria has failed. The two doctors are further studying what elements have such effects.</p>
<p>Use of "Tantalum" in Manufacturing—Tantalum has been found to be the most ideal metal for surgical instruments that has been sought for a long time. Because it is strong, flexible, stainless, non-toxic, and harmless, it can be made into various forms, and has no "electrolytic effect" when encountering blood; and it can be used to repair human defects. Tantalum sheets, wires, and foils can be used to repair damaged parts of the bones of the brain and nose; tantalum has an important position in surgical medicine.</p>
<h3>Anti-Aircraft Shelter Couplet</h3>

<h3>Before and After Victory</h3>
<p>— Sima Huan</p>
<p>"After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, everyone had a misconception that life would be better and they could enjoy themselves after the victory, even myself. But now I know it was wrong."</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Xulun is naive and will admit his mistakes himself.</p>
<p>I know that some friends couldn't even afford to ride a rickshaw in Chongqing before the victory, but now they are even preparing to use ten or eight gold bars to buy a car.</p>
<p>Who is willing to endure hardship again?</p>

<p>Three Words and Two Words Collection</p>
<p>— Wuling Ren</p>
<h3>Heaven is High, the Emperor is Far Away, There are Few People, but Many Livestock</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang personally stated that those who manipulate and hoard grain will be shot to death upon verification. Indeed, if we want to "not" let the rice weevils act strangely again, the most effective way is to chop off the heads of a few unscrupulous merchants. When the character for rice is chopped off, it becomes the character for "not," and perhaps it will be possible to "not" act strangely again.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu repeatedly said at the Tsinghua alumni welcome party and the press conference that workers should know that if they want to eat chicken eggs, they must not kill the hen first. Now the hens that are seen have not been killed, and they will also die themselves. It is very likely that in the near future, Shanghai will suffer from chicken plague. We certainly hope that those who want to eat chicken eggs will not kill the hen, and at the same time, we also hope that the owner has proper methods for raising chickens.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance stipulates that banks are not allowed to make gold collateral loans. A number of gold collateral loans were discovered by the Chongqing Bank due to a theft case. Is this what is called accidental?</p>
<p>The "pigsty" is the one who is enthusiastic about starting work! This is a fact. According to the report, "The pig workers at the No. 1 Slaughterhouse on Shajing Road and the No. 2 Slaughterhouse on Nanyang Bridge clashed due to opposition to the exploitations and reneging of the pig party." In this way, the pigs in the slaughterhouse, although they will eventually be cut down, can at least prolong their lives for some time.</p>
<p>"Heaven is high and the emperor is far away, there are few people but many livestock;" the situation in general corrupt institutions can be understood from these two sentences.</p>
<p>Tang Yiming, a giant businessman from Chongqing, initiated the idea of ​​reconstructing the Chongqing Xiaochangkou Square into a garden and building a seven-story garden building. Therefore, I connected to how the Chongqing Great Tunnel should be utilized. In this hot summer (Chongqing has been very hot recently), if you store a boat of Rongyu in the cave, it would be a summer resort, comparable to the Sang Geng books of Qiuyuan.</p>
<p>The Beijing News reported that "Officials are conducting a door-to-door investigation of vacant houses. If the homeowner is still detained and does not rent them out, the municipal government will rent them out on its behalf. Those who own houses and wait for a good price to sell are all panicked and are scrambling to find suitable tenants." This is exactly what the proverb says, "The meat in the walnut will not come out without knocking." There are not fewer walnuts in Shanghai than in Nanjing; the peach shell is not afraid of being hard, only afraid of no one picking up a stick to knock.</p>
<p>At a banquet, I heard the female worker representatives of a certain factory sing several popular famous songs in public, and they unanimously praised the high level of the female workers. In fact, ten or twelve years ago, female workers could also sing a few songs, only the tunes of the songs were different in the past and present. Is it the progress of the songs? Or the progress of the female workers?</p>
