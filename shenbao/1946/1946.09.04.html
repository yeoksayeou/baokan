<h3>吳張分訪司使周恩來　五人會期尚待商定　馬師返京謀促商談成功</h3>
<p>〔本報牯嶺三日電〕馬歇爾特使，三日晨八時離牯返京，聞主席二日晚九時甘分曾往訪，談的一小時，馬特使本週末仍將來牯。聞渠此行係在促成五人會談獲得　期成功。</p>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕馬特使三日午十一時一刻飛抵京，即逕返行館休息，下午五時司使至海寗路與馬使晤談，六時半始辭出。</p>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕周恩來三日下午一時半返抵京，以天熱旅程勞頓未外出，囑王炳南於四時至美大使館，吿以本日不能來訪，頃悉：周氏擬四日首先往見馬帥，獲取馬帥自牯所得意見，幷將與司徒大使見面。至非正式小組會議舉行時日，尙待司使與國·共雙方交換意見後，始能確定。一般咸盼會前之折衝完滿，俾會議進行順利，一次會議後即可有所成就。</p>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕吳鐵城·張厲生，三日晨十時赴美大使館，與司使作會議進行前之交換意見。吳氏曾就政協開會以來歷次商談經過，作詳盡之說明與分析。旋司使即就月來參加商談經過加以詳述，至十一時三刻吳·張二氏辭出。關於共產黨堅持之兩項前提，據張氏表示，此乃軍事上問題，目前吾人祗就政治途徑尋求解決。據另息，如共黨堅持之意見能於會外進行商討，而不作會議中之主題，則政府仍願以忍耐之態度與之商談。</p>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕吳鐵城·張厲生三日下午五時半訪周恩來，談的半小時，據聞，談話中心在交換意見，周並再對兩項前提加以詢問，據聞，吳等對停戰一事，未作肯定答覆。</p>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕非正式五人小組會議之召開日期，就三日晚各方情勢觀測，端視周恩來與馬·司見面後，始可決定。因馬·司兩氏向主席建議召開此項會議時，並無所謂先決條件，但周氏今忽一再堅持所謂兩項先決條件，故此中尙不免有一番曲折。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京三日電〕據悉：非正式五人小組，將不採會議形式，而係商談性質，商談時不設主席，亦不拘定方式，故定名爲非正式五人小組會談。又據中共發言人稱：中共方面仍在等待政府對所提兩點之答復，至是否參加五人小組，尙未加以考慮。</p>

<h3>中樞舉行隆重典禮　白部長懇切致詞　必須以建設保障成果</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京三日電〕今日為抗戰勝利紀念日，此八年來全國軍民浴血犧牲奮門所獲得之勝利殊榮，將永為我中華民族歷史光明　　之一頁，中樞於晨九時在國府大禮堂舉行紀念典禮，儀式　單隆重，由張委員繼主持。到中委及文武官員二百餘人，主席　導行禮後，由白部長崇　致詞，　述紀念意義。</p>
<p>追述抗戰難苦</p>
<p>白部長首稱：今日爲抗戰八年光榮勝利之紀念日，在過去八年神聖抗戰中，由於我政府堅定正確之最高國策，以及政略與戰略，與全國軍民一致在最高領袖領導下犧牲奮鬥，與盟軍共同作戰，故終能擊潰日人，穫致最後勝利，回憶航戰開始，我國單獨與日本作戰，因經濟文化各種條件，均極薄弱，極感艱苦，然所以尙能長期抗戰，乃一面賴我數千年民族之自信力與悠久之文化力量，一面則由於　總理　大主義之感召所致，終以縱遭遇物質上之種種困難，但精神方面實足以補救此缺點，其後太平洋戰事，與日蘇戰爭先後繼起，同盟國家聯合作戰，我單獨對日之戰爭，遂一變而爲盟國共同對敵之戰爭，故終能得到抗戰勝利，但必須以建設保障勝利之碩果，在抗戰期間，吾人嘗以抗戰必勝，建國必成爲口號，今第二步建國工作，必須即依照總理建國大網進行，並遵照總裁指示吾人以建設保障勝利成果之訓示，而開始建國大業。</p>
<p>今後建設途徑</p>
<p>白氏繼述及今後建設之途徑，分別就政治，經濟，軍事，文化四大建設扼要闡明，關於政治建設，白氏强調必須從速建立地方自治之基礎，並稱：國民大會業已定期召開，即將制定憲法準備實施憲政，但憲政須有自治之基礎，故亟應加緊實行新縣制，並實行三民主義關於經濟建設，主席已通令今年決實行二五减租，吾人若談經濟建設，則起碼須從减輕農民負担着手，故下五减租辦法，亟應實施，至於提高人民生活及增進人民康樂等措施，非一蹴可成。</p>
<p>繼續進整軍</p>
<p>白氏論及軍事建設稱：整軍方案，決繼續進行，現隴海路以南已有五十四軍整編完竣，但不幸隴海以北部隊，因故尙不能進行整編，至於編餘官兵，已定有轉來等安置辦法，此外對於國防建設，如陸軍之改編空軍之建立，海軍之加强，均當本旣定方針進行，俾完成近代的與科學的國肪。白氏繼指出文化建設，應着重普遍提高國民教育水準，同時發展科學教育，以充實國防力量。</p>
<p>排除統一障礙</p>
<p>白氏最後强調國家必須統一政令應統一，軍令亦應統一，故一切妨礙統一之力量，均當排除，此爲政府之責任，至於如何排除一切障礙，如何排除一切困難，則端賴全國人民共同努力。詞畢禮成，與會人員旋赴靈谷寺致祭忠烈。</p>

<h3>美讓售民用剩餘物資　供應局開始處理　周自新飛冲繩籌備運輸</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美國讓售民用剩餘物資，行政院業經決定由物資供應局負責處理，昨據該局負責人稱：此項物資原値為八億五千餘萬元，此中尚應除去折舊及美國應抵償我國之法幣舊債，其所餘數額應如何付償，雙方所簽合約中尚未全盤規定，但折舊辦法應由美方籌劃。</p>
<p>供應局副局長周自新，昨已奉命偕工程專家六人飛往冲繩島，擬在該處設立冲繩島儲整處，由周氏兼任處長。尚有八人，定今日前往，以後如交通便利，將陸續派往該處辦事者，約達四五十人。冲繩島方面物資預計二月運淸。至關島·塞班島等地，如交通便利，亦將派員往設儲整處。一切物資之運輸，均歸美方協助負責。</p>
<p>該局於物資運到後，將分類托由指定之機關處理，如木材一類，交中央信託局，船舶類交招商局，交通器材交交通部，原棉歸中國紡織建設公司，車輛托聯合車輛推銷商辦事處承辦。此外將以大額物資標售，一部份物資，公開登報拍賣，至口糧等則仍以最低價格配給公敎人員。現該局正計劃如何儲藏及安置物資。大致除一部分必需品需儲於堆棧外，因堆棧無多，其他能不加遮蓋之貨物，則將放置於空塲內。又為防止物資到達後有盜竊走漏之弊，該局特令全體職工製備制服，届時並將派大量憲兵在碼頭警戒，非該局職工不得在警戒區出入。</p>
<p>物資供應局並宣布，將在天津·重慶·廣東及南京設立分局，處理此項物資。</p>
<p>紐約時報評論</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約二日電〕紐約時報評論美國以剩餘物資移讓中國之事，認為乃美國加速擴充中國經濟之一大進展，但周恩來認為此項轉讓，將予中央政府以從事攻擊共軍之力量，周氏等認為，此項物資，予蔣主席至少與彼等作戰三年之力量時，據稱：中國共黨強烈反對此事，蓋此舉無疑增進中國中央合法政府之資源，但移讓物品中，並未包括飛機或其他武器，馬帥對此自己獲悉，且表贊同，此舉表示吾人之眞正努力，即不煽動戰爭，而僅欲中國堅強團結，俾和平可能實現。同時，吾人顯尚不能一如共黨所要求者，吾人尚無撤離中國之意。該報論及中國僅以成本五分之一購買此項剩餘物資時稱：美國應認為非常滿意，承認此項合同「至為合理」，蓋其使吾人得以處理否則即無法出售之貨物，俾吾人在太平洋一帶分散之物資得以復員，且使我人及友邦　　　　之友誼。同時，此舉對中國經濟復興，亦至有裨益，蓋其可　止中國通貨膨脹，而其對刺激工業之成效，甚至將無法估計。</p>
<h3>中菲兩國民航談判　僅成立臨時約定　永久性協定待從長商討</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕據曾參與中·菲民航談判之交部某負責人談：中菲民航談判已吿一段落，惟所成立者僅為一臨時性之口頭約定，外傳兩國已在首都簽訂民航合約說並不確，至永久性協定，則尚待從長商討，始克訂定。據稱：此一臨時性之口頭約定，純係基於雙方之需要，成立後對於僑胞來回祖國與菲島之間，可便利不少，蓋太平洋戰事結束後，在菲僑胞頗多急於回國者，而滯留祖國之僑胞，亦多渴望返菲，當時因事實上需要，曾與菲方臨時約定，雙方有不定期之飛機來往兩國間，然此終非久計，故有此次臨時口頭約定之成立。根據約定，有兩個菲律賓航空公司之飛機，每週得在上海降落二次，而我國之中航機，每週亦可在馬尼剌降落兩次，中央航空公司飛機，將來亦可在菲降落。此舉不但便利僑胞不少，即對增進兩國貿易關係，亦大有裨益。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>自古成功在嘗試！</h3>
<p>專商國府改組問題的「五人小組」據說今天要在首都開始正式商談了。在戰火遍地的「全武行」期間，有此意外的一幕「文戲」，台下觀衆自可一淸耳目。不管它成功與否，商談總比拒絕商談好。</p>
<p>不過這次五人小組商談的任務，還是言人人殊。政府代表說，馬帥和司徒大使原來的建議，聲明只限於商討改組後的國府委員會中共參加名額問題，不及其它。不但軍事問題不討論，即行政院各部會問題也不在此時商談，甚至中共以外其它黨派參加國府委員名額問題亦不在商談之列。但中共代表却還口口聲聲說，要頒布停戰令，要政府收回共軍退出某種工區的要求，好像這些都是此次商談的附加條件。其實，馬帥司使二位和平老人的見解，一些也不錯；假使國府能叨天之福，改組圓滿，各黨派代表和社會賢達相聚一堂，從容議政，些後無論什麼軍國大計，都可取決於此最高無上的國府委員會，何必還先要在此時多所爭論？故今天開始的商談，只要雙方都具有眞正的誠意，國家大局未始不在此際有一綫的轉機。</p>
<p>然而，由牯嶺回京的政府代表吳鐵城張厲生兩氏，雖力稱主席曾勉勵他們必須盡力使五人小組獲得成功，而中共代表周恩來氏則前晚尚逗留在滬暢觀「蘇聯之光」的影片，昨晨赴京還帶着沉重的心情，向人說此去商談不過嘗試而已，好似一些信心也沒有。信仰生力量，現在中共的代表對五人商談自己先沒有信心，不知他還有什麼誠意，還能有什麼力量？可是，我們還記得提倡白話文的胡適之先生，當年寫白話詩，印了一本「嘗試集」，吟着一句有名的翻案詩句：「自古成功在嘗試」。所以今天開始的商談，儘管周恩來氏說不過是嘗試，如果他眞有誠意嘗試，嘗試也未嘗不可以成功。吳鐵城氏所說，縱有困難，祗須誠意談判，即能獲得成功，大槪也同我們一樣的想法。</p>
<p>至於國府委員各黨派名額分配問題，我們以為如果眞想求其解決，也並不是千難萬難的事。只要不用「否決權」這種於理不通於法不合的名詞出來，未始不可因商談而獲得解決。因為，按照以前政治協商會議所通過的政府組織案，其中第六條規定，一般議案以出席委員過半數通過為有效，惟涉及變更「政協」所通過的施政綱領之議案則以出席委員三分之二通過為有效，而議案是否涉及施政綱領之變更，如有疑義，則其解釋仍取決於出席委員之過半數。我們以為國民黨旣具誠心實行政協所決議的「施政綱領」，則可知它並不企圖有所變更，旣如此，則中共名額多一人或二人，其實也沒有多大關係。只須國民黨的委員們，自己爭氣，自己每次出席，自己彼此態度一致，絕不參差出入，或甚至背道而馳，則一個正正當當的議案，難道還恐怕不能有過半數的通過嗎？因此，我們要如此說：國民黨所爭者應該是政策，國民黨所求者應該是人才，國民黨所當約束者應該是自己的委員，若國民黨的眼光不向內看，而但爭他黨名額之多寡，分配之比例，那眞是鑽牛角尖的想法。我們希望中共不要鑽進此路不通的「否決權」牛角尖，國民黨也不要鑽進必須尅制中共名額限於八人的牛角尖，雙方都有誠意，則此次商談當可由法度而進於成功。</p>
<p>從希臘公民投票說起</p>
<p>希臘於本月一日舉行公民投票，以決定該國的政體，各地陸續開票，平均百分之七十五贊成希臘國王喬始二世返國復辟。在舉行公民投票的那一天，左派與右派的競爭，雖然非常劇烈；但在英美觀察員的監視之下，並未發生意外事件，一般選民也均能憑自己的意志，自由投票，未受到任何壓力。這次公民投票的結果，當可目為希臘民意的表現，足使混亂如麻的希臘政局得以澄淸。</p>
<p>戰後的巴爾幹半島，幾已成為斯拉夫民族的天下，碩果僅存的，唯有希臘一國而已。因此，希臘也就成為英蘇兩國與蘇聯角逐的塲所。加以希臘與阿爾巴尼亞，保加利亞，曁南斯拉夫三國，都有領土的紏葛，乃成為斯拉夫各國的眼中釘。希臘當局為鞏固自己的地位起見，不得不要求英軍仍駐留境內，以維持國內的秩序。蘇聯為了這件事，幾次三番，在聯合國安全理事會中，指責英軍駐留希臘，足以擾亂巴爾幹局勢，從而威脅世界和平。這次烏克蘭代表曼紐斯基，向安全理事會控訴希臘，也說英軍駐留希臘境內，干涉該國的內政，足以危害和平。</p>
<p>希臘在英蘇矛盾的夾縫裏，應付局勢的變遷，固極不易，但是內閣總理蔡爾達利斯，立定脚跟，對於斯拉夫各國的外交攻勢，始終不肯退讓一步。例如在巴黎和會中，南斯拉夫與保加利亞兩國代表，輙針對着希臘，大肆抨擊，在紐約安全理事會中，烏克蘭代表發表反希言論，更是振振有詞，不是說希臘向阿爾巴尼亞挑釁，引起邊界衝突，就是說希臘企圖改變巴爾幹半島的國界，而希臘政府却始終堅定，不為所屈。</p>
<p>希臘在國際上旣成為衆矢之的，到處受人的欺侮與凌辱，自然容易激起人民的愛國心，使他們更加傾向英國。這次公民投票，右派獲勝，雖出於意料之外，但也是最近國際局勢演變的自然結果，巴黎報紙稱為斯拉夫集團弄巧成拙，不無暗示着深刻的意義。</p>
<p>戰前英國在東南歐洲的勢力，原來根深蒂固，是不可動搖的。但是在大戰之後，巴爾幹形勢改觀，成了斯拉夫民族的世界，英國的勢力日見式微。加以蘇聯對於土耳其海峽問題，又懷有極大的雄心，自戰事結束以來，蘇聯曾一再要求土國，共同防衛海峽地位，使英國在近東的地位，也面臨一重嚴重的威脅。此外，在中東有伊朗問題，還有巴勒斯坦問題，使英國處處感到「頭痛」。因此，英國為維持其帝國的地位計，更不得不抓住希臘，絲毫不肯放鬆，不任其投入斯拉夫民族集團的懷抱裏去，而欲留為英國向東南歐洲發展的跳板。希臘國王喬治二世，現在倫敦，內閣總理蔡爾達利斯將亦自巴黎前往，報吿此次公民投票結果，請其早日返國復辟。從此英希兩國的關係，必形親密，而英蘇的衝突恐怕更要尖銳化了。</p>
<p>希臘的政治，素以民主見稱，目下雖然仍保持君主政體的形式，但在實質上，與英國的政治相彷彿，誰也不能稱為反民主的政體。至其國內，有左右兩派之分，除了在內政上意見不同而外，在外交上也是南轅北轍的。其實，在今日任何一國的情形，都是如此，以英國而論，英國共產黨也在那裏反對美國，反對工黨內閣協助希臘的外交政策。所以我們對於希臘的左右兩派，決不可以民主與反民主作為分野。蘇聯所以反對希臘舉行公民投票，所以反對希臘現行政府繼續執政，與其說是因為希臘政府的不民主，毋寗說是因為蔡爾達利斯內閣的外交政策接近英國，而與蘇聯的利害不一致。「一葉落而知天下秋」。希臘此次投票的結果，勢必更增東南歐洲方面世界兩大勢力對峙局勢之緊張程度。</p>

<h3>印政府主席尼赫魯　宣布大政方針　印度由印人治理　推行十年計改善民生</h3>
<p>〔本報綜合消息〕據聯合社新德里電，國大黨總裁尼赫魯今日宣誓就任印度臨時政府主席，並招待記者，發表談話，謂彼當以服務印度人民爲職志，並表示將實行十年計劃，改善民生。並稱，印度臨時政府尙有三項政策足述，即（一）吾人當以責任內閣體制，共同討論各事，共同決策，共同負責（二）印度境內之外國僑民僅係暫時居住，吾人歡迎其作爲一平民居住但在官職上，則若輩必須退出。印度此後將由印度人自己治理，以謀印度人之福利。（三）自由爲吾人最高目標，但吾人必須正視衣·食·住·教育及衛生等迫切問題。最後尼氏呼籲印度人民勿互相衝突，而常共同合作。復據法國新聞社新德里電，印度臨時政府宣吿成立後，各地回教徒舉行示威運動，均臂纏黑紗，分成大小隊伍，遊行市街，向政府及總督府前進。政府雖已下令禁止公共集會，但警察當局並未干涉，回教徒乃於晚間攀登電桿項，懸掛黑色火旗，以誌衰悼之意，情况凄凉。但政府當局曁國大黨黨員，均漢不動心。回教徒與印度教來往街頭，亦未發生騷擾，警察似獲有訓令，唯有於發生暴動時始得有所行動。</p>
<p>據聯合社電，孟買市三日晨將破曉時，印回教徒又起紛擾，至此，已知之喪生人數，已增爲七十二人，暴動情形，雖頗劇烈，但歷時頗短，經警察開槍即行告終。現孟買一般情况似不若星期一緊張。故本市即將恢復正常狀態之希望義濃。</p>

<h3>太平洋和會　美正在積極籌備中　日可成為思想衝突鎗尖　草擬對日和約當持以審愼</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二日電〕美國政府現正努力籌備起草太平洋和約之國際會議，惟於何時召集及由何國參加，大部份尙未決定。爲日本起草者爲何種和約，亦尙不得面知。盟國佔領日本，迄今已屆一週年，其佔領之成績將決定和約性質，自不待言。至今日爲止，其佔領係屬具有善意，此與美國態度之公正，在麥帥總部對日政府頒發之指令巾，可以槪見一斑。據前表示，對日和約將非復仇性質，預料起草和約之戰勝國，將取聽其生存之態度。據關心太平洋和平之美國高級官塲消息，國務院與麥帥正在積極準備召開和會，其時間無論或早或遲，美國均將以小心準備之廣大計劃參加會議，以此作爲日本及太平洋區和平之基本條件。</p>
<p>監督日本民政甘五年為期</p>
<p>據權威方面消息，按照未來計劃，美國之軍事佔領，將歷時三年至五年，然後繼以民政管理，受盟軍監督二十五年。屆時日本人民　政府，當已充份革新，依照盟國在波茨坦宣言中所舉之日　與宗旨，使日本成為國際間之一員，接受及擁護穩健的民主原則。此間以爲因政治理想之對立而致形勢緊張，使盟國在日本之措施益見重要。日本地處要衝，已成民主國家之前綫，目前日本帝國可成爲衝突思想之鎗尖，或竟爲未來世界大戰之爆發點，亦未可知。麥帥所發指令，當可大部份決定日本未來管理之方式，及其生活標準與社會狀况。</p>
<p>有關戰略問題·調整感困難</p>
<p>惟有關日本之戰略問題，於起草和約時必須加以考慮，其解決或不免發生困難。盟國於陸海空軍問題或不易獲致同意，在日本及東方有重大利益之國家，在和約中必須與以調整，以免彼此衝突。至於和約條件果將由誰擬訂，此時尙還未決。遠東委員會或將担任召集和會，此外未加入遠東委員會之國家是否可參加和會，亦爲一未決之點。委員會對於和約條件，目前並不關心，其主要之關切則爲日本憲法。委員會並米切實担任通過憲法，但欲確知其係遵照波茨坦宣言，委員亦正在硏究日本課稅制度，預料日內將有所公布。其聲明巾擬確定住居日本之外僑，此後僅與日人繳納同樣捐稅，以免較視。華盛頓官塲對於太平洋整個局勢頗抱樂觀，相信各關係國之問，雖不免意見相左，但必能獲得和平解決，而領導世界各國以趨向普徧的和平。</p>
<h3>羅斯福高瞻遠瞩　其子撰文談乃父觀感</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約二日電〕美國「展望雜誌」今日發表故羅斯福總　子埃利沃所著「自渠觀之」一書中一段內稱：一九四三年一月舉行卡薩勃朗加會議後，余（埃利沃自稱）父曾謂：美人之喪生於太平洋，皆英法荷短視之故，除非取消殖民制度，世界仍不免面臨第三次戰爭。此次戰後，吾人如仍令數千百萬之人民居於半奴隸之狀態，其結果實難想像，埃利沃復謂：邱吉爾永遠以爲吾人常進入中歐，與紅軍相遇，使英國之勢力圈儘量向東拓展。余父晤及邱吉爾，蒙特巴頓，及其他領袖後，曾吿我謂，英國欲收復緬甸，爲其殖民帝國也，緬甸可影響越南，印度，及印尼，若此等國家中之一國獲得自由，則其他數國必起而效法，戴高樂亦不顧使其他殖民商國消失。印度，爪哇，緬甸，越南等地，但見物資之運出，不見任何代價之運入，此乃另一戰爭之遠因。吾人如戰勝，將由四强負責和平，進行發展教育，提高生活水準等任務，迨落後之地區已經成熟後，應使其獨立。余父曾明吿邱吉爾：美國之參戰，決非爲協助英國等保持中古時代之帝國思想。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市府接收物資管理處被檢舉之價値四十億元物資舞弊案，淸查團張慶楨委員會親訪吳市長進行　查。記者於昨日午後六時趨訪吳市長，叩詢此案詳情，據吳市長稱：錢市長任內，秉承主席指示，多辦福利事業，對本市公教人員原擬配給賣物，因感實物發放不便，故改發米貸金，每人按月二萬元，該款項概由接收偽中央市塲物資標售所得，共有三十一億餘元。吳市長稱本人到任後，因感警察清道夫等待遇菲薄，米貸金一時不能取消，但款項籌揹無着，故繼續標售該項物資，唯本人任內各次標售均由審計部參加，共得款十一二億元，除撥充消費合作社基金五千萬元外，餘皆用於米貸金。午後七時張慶楨委員於訪問吳市長歸來語本報記者稱：吳市長對該案解釋甚詳，至於錢市長任期內標售所得之三十一億餘元中，曾撥二億元充靑年團經費，餘情不詳。吳市長並提交張委員市府宗三件備查，計農產市塲一件，興業信託社一件，上海市政府接收偽中央市塲卷宗一件。張委員對此案十分重視，並定今晨再向市府接收物資管理處調閱接收僞中央市塲全部物資淸册，以作偵查根據。唯張委員於調查未竣事前，不擬發表意見。聞密吿人爲前市政府某高級職員，檢舉前任接收物資管理處勾結商人非法標售物資，任意分配售得款項，且言營私舞弊證據確鑿云。</p>

<p>判決書中指陳當日荷克所受日軍法庭之審判，旣屬不合法而不公正，且係違反戰時公法，田中久一身爲香港總督，對於此項不公平之判決未予阻止，應負其責。福地春南則爲實際下令審判及執行之負責長官。久保日外係當時法庭上之主審官，山口教一及渡邊昌盛均係陪審官，因山口係日二十三軍軍法處人員，對於法律自應明瞭，但仍予荷克以不公平之判決，故其罪狀較渡邊爲重。至於淺川弘子係受業巳畏罪自殺之前香港日政府司法首長Saboru　Shii之指派，實爲無辜受累，故予無罪釋放，此項判決書俟美軍總部核准後，即可執行。　昨日各犯聆悉判決時，除淺川弘子喜出望外頻頻向庭上鞠躬外，田中久一等五犯均面色鐵靑，一言不發，即由憲兵押離法庭。</p>

<h3>紡建新策明朗化　昨日開布掛牌價已提高　雙馬擬壓低至一三五萬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紡建開布，二十支經緯十二磅無牌　布五萬三千元，四君子納夫妥大紅七萬二千元，跳鲤元直貢緞六萬九千元，查外匯變率之前，五福細布係廿三支廿二支紐織亦僅五萬三千，而納夫妥大紅則爲六萬八千，其開價之加碼，盤益趨明朗化，此種方策，在外匯變率後數日，即已醞釀，其法係以次牌之貨，掛原有正牌之價，又以　售之法，行接近黑市價之實，惟在民營紗廠派紗未受控制前，尚不敢公然大漲，現期商場開紗，旣已集中管理，其開價且自一百四十萬壓小至一百三十八萬，紡建之將漲價，本報在上期已有預測，無足怪也，昨日紡建掛牌以前，市面布價，本已小去一二千元，及其掛牌見漲，市面即隧之波動，幸節前實鋿無多，銀根又甚緊急，故所漲尚應有限，以昨日紡建所開售之價而言，做黑市者尚略有賺頭，則就事論事，其掛牌之漲，似不必能刺激市面也。所惜者總是布疋根子太緊，人心在實際上要不免向上，昨開之十二磅無牌細布出貨地點遠在吳淞蘊草浜，而請購者仍爭先恐後，可爲明證，四君子準　係熱門　貨，昨亦停開，對於色布市面，尤不免掀抬，紡建對於民營紗廠開紗之管制，正在整飭之中，據消息靈通方面談稱，雙馬標準有壓低至一百三十五萬之可能，一部紗廠轉移其紗以供自織布疋，態度上並不樂於接受派紗單子，但賣紗終究比賣布可能賺錢，則不疋根子難以見鬆也，有地位之觀察家，亦指陳紡建正在努力於黑市之壓低，明市之抬高，但恐需供所關，明市之加碼，終不免刺激黑市云。</p>
<p>昨日紗布，急轉直下，華南船期未定，是以粵帮袖手觀望，未見湧進，湘渶及津京等帮亦少去胃，同行俱抱脫貨求財心思，傾向吐售，是以雙馬復進一百六十萬關，最後以一百五十五六萬收盤，人心轉淡，趨勢仍是脆弱之象，統計廿支雜牌跌三五萬，雙馬跌八九萬，四十二支跌十二萬之巨。</p>
<h3>金鈔均以回升　市况甚為堅定</h3>
<p>焓赤昨有反動，銀根在近午稍微見鬆，買氣遂盛，但中央銀行仍在隨市管制中，晨開二〇二萬有售，人心旣畏壓力，又扼於銀根，會降至二〇〇萬三，始形見定，微吿回上，十時後中央銀行配給一二七條，價為二〇二萬，此後逐漸由平和轉趨穩定，十一時後銀根見鬆，買戶興動，頗多補轉，盤漲到二〇五萬八，中央銀行不時調整，力售不已，高後回落至二〇四萬內，午刻站二〇四萬五，午後隔日交割哄高至二〇六萬外，而後仍被壓制，結果較前收回升二萬四，飾金念一萬八，紋銀銀元均平，暗拆見鬆，但尚恍惚，暗息自一角六至二角一不等。</p>
<p>外幣疲後亦吿回振，美鈔晨開三二四〇元有買，此價一度小起掙扎，十時後始吿上升，扒空者紛紛，近午迫近三三〇〇元關，午刻略定，午後初堅後定，結果較前收回升六十元，港票初因廣州報低至六六〇元，仍在六七〇元左右，後隨金鈔進展至七〇〇元外，結果回升二十五元，港匯六九〇元至七〇〇元，印匯八四〇元至八五〇元，英匯一一〇〇〇元至一一五〇〇元，美匯牌價需要不多。</p>
<h3>逢低即有拉抬　公債黑市穩健　市塲謠傳種種　當局認為無稽</h3>
<p>公債大戶出入不一，惟人心尚見穩健，低後易於拉高，統丙初因某大戶向對敲號家林某處斬售甚鉅，自二四〇〇元起一再萎縮，不久退落至二〇〇〇元關，始吿泯止，於是經過短時期之徘徊後，經五樓七樓某兩大戶連袂活動，逐步回漲，中途扳高至二八〇〇元，臨收仍回下至二六五〇元左右，結果較前收漲起一七〇元，甲乙升一百元，丁戊各好五十元。</p>
<p>〔南京二日電〕最近上海公債黑市，又起波動，記者特走訪財部錢幣司負責人，據談，政府並未考慮變更公債償還辦法，滬傳種種，全侨係投機份子之謠言，正當商人，不應捕風捉影，自尋煩惱。</p>
<h3>呢羢定價報漲</h3>
<p>近來本市呢羢批價，因受高利貸關係，除大範圍與五六年老店外，莫不動盪不安，內外行紛紛將貨出　，遇有殷實受主，即開半月或一月期支票亦樂於收用，觀乎去路，客帮與本街雖續有採辦，然其進胃遠較過去爲弱，因受續有定到關係，買方用戶無一不延緩購進而望其下降也，但洋行訂貨價格，美英等商接得國外來電，本月份起均皆報漲，照前定價每碼增漲二分鈿至五分鈿不等，不規矩之小行家，甚至已收受定洋出有定單者亦欲追加，亦可見邇日營做呢羢生意之困苦矣。</p>
<h3>廠商購進生產原料　交行可以墊款</h3>
<p>交通銀行自舉辦代理公私企業機關墊款，購進生產原料以來，廠商稱使，前往治商請墊代理者頗多，據記者查悉，其請墊辦法大要如下。凡公私企業機關，向交行申請墊款代理購運生產原料時，首應塡眞申請書，經交行核准後，即訂立正式契約，並自墊款日起，按息計算，其利率之多寡，在事先由雙方商定之，利率大多在五分左右。</p>

<h3>糖價評議會　决定批發·零售價　台糖公司將儘量配售　中砂每担爲十四萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市食糖，自社會局與台糖公司商定配售以來，其配售價已逐步壓低到每担七萬元。批發與零售之利潤，均經規定，但此等配售價一萬五千元，糖粉達三十一萬元，多數流入黑市，黑市價已抬到每担二十萬元以上，門售每斤，抬到二千元以上，一般民衆，享不到平價之利益，該局爰與公司商定，於昨日下午四時，召集市商會。糖業公會。南貨業公會等代表，商討改進辦法，出席者爲台糖公司經協理沈鎭南·宋以信·醫業公會代表陳枬周，南貨商業同業公會常務理事處如品，及市商會駱清華等各代表，首由局長吳開先主席，決定（一）組織上海市食糖平價評議委員會，當推上連出席之各代表為委員，（二）調整配售價至中砂每担十四萬元，生砂十三萬元，（三）零售每斤一千元，對市民另發購糖證，經售商店，酌給利潤，（四）外埠批發，由糖行經辦，（五）外埠配糖，改向台糖公司，直接申請，（六）自此次調整後由公司增加配額，儘量配售。</p>

<h3>新粳秈平疲　油價塲外續升</h3>
<p>米市消化仍懈，陳粳白元，貨稀站定，新秈則各路來源蟬聯，中下等步削千元，新粳中次亦疲千元，昨日南北市塲客貨登記，共爲七千九百餘石，麵粉廠方開出仍少，零化仍殷，塲外價再升一二百元，小麥閩甬動而不旺，北化亦淡，略呈疲呆之狀，步小五六百元，黃豆汕頭停辦，新豆來貨涌旺，陳豆王安均有到源，消化呆滯，猛跌二千餘元，生仁平定，黃麻績小千元，苞米靑島不動，再跌千元。　豆亦短千元，油市因靑島來源稀少，本廠出貨不多，產區高昂，划申倒應，形趨求過於供，塲外續升一二千元，豆餅消路微細，步跌一二百元。</p>

<h3>等於兩重營業稅　筵席稅不宜苛擾　立法應求人民易知易行　爲粗求一飽者稍留餘地</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市商會爲據酒菜業，請求減低筵席稅，向當局請求四點辦法，昨特具函轉呈市府及財政局，代爲協同呼籲，原函略稱：查本市酒菜商業同業公會，向鈞府（貴局）請求四事：（一）爲請將筵席稅減爲百分之十。（二）請求確定日當飲食褾準，除筵席以外，不徵筵席稅。（三）覆議筵席館商漏登發票處罰辦法。（四）免令各館商使用　一發票等情。業於八月卅一日，逕呈鈞府（貴局）。所陳事實理由，已極詳盡，查現在滬市所徵之筵席稅，旣將向來採用至評議方式攤派性質一律更改，按照奉頒發票，實報實徵。並將另向顧客徵收辦法，予以取銷，改由館商自行負担，實際上不　完納兩重營業稅。負担稠疊，確有爲難。現在各業續納營業稅，係照法定稅率減半徵收。是該公會所請將筵席稅一項依照稅率改徵百分之十，非無先例可援。且與卅五年一月以前實際徵收情形，亦屬相符。擬請准予照減，俾該業得抒喘息。又查筵席捐之徵收，係限制人民奢侈消費起見，日用飲食，實應不在徵收之列。即使防其化整為零，逃避稅收，亦應依照現在物價，及上年九月間相距之比例，另定起徵單價，庶免除今日無館不捐現象。爲粗求一飽之平民，稍留餘地。至三四兩項，純係手續問題，但辦法繁苛，等於索瘢　垢，使人民重足而立。酒菜館內部組織以及人事方面，決不能如新式公司組織之商店，有完備之記帳手續。會經訓練合格之記帳人才，果照原擬辦法施行，必至動輒得咎，時遭鉅罰，實非國家原情立法體恤商艱之道。該公會所請，就查獲發票補稅議罰，已足以示懲儆。如用推算方法，必致大晵騷擾，近於昔人所謂鍜鍊羅織。發票僅爲飲食記數之用，祇求明瞭，即足濟事。如果另頒劃一方式，必致以使用人程度不齊，發生使用困難情事。公家創立一切辦法，應使人民易知易行，免涉瑣細，以官廳之命令，統一商家之發票，且先從程度不齊之酒菜館着手，實足引起無窮困難，擬請免予施行，實爲公便。</p>

<h3>日戰犯酒井隆判決書</h3>
<p>〔續八月卅一日本報〕其在廣東南海一帶督戰時，自民國三十年十一月三十二年三月，縱兵屠殺村民無算，其姓名可考者，有蔡李氏，湯帝祥等一百餘人均以亂槍掃射或以刀劍衝刺，更對平民肆施灌水，吊打之酷刑，因而致重傷者，有李永根等十九人，致死者有頗伙，沈啓强，盧永呂三人。其殺害手段最殘酷者，如在沙頭鄉石牌村，將村民李輝吊打火火，投人浦中，以亂槍射死。</p>
<p>又在廣州黃沙，用鐵棍猛擊懷孕六月之村婦馬何氏，以致重傷流產，並將歐陽劉氏毒打後投之河中溺斃，又在三水縣附近山谷中，有少婦二人被其部屬十四人依决輪姦，並剖裂肚腹，以其鮮血飼犬，更有南文村村民邢毅梅夫婦二人，被用菜刀活剖腹部，哀號而斃，復縱部隊在南海縣屬各地，驅逐平民出境，使老幼婦孺，流離失所，並焚燬民房七百餘間，沒收禾田百餘畝，掠刧民間食糧·家禽·牲畜不可勝計。民國三十年十二月八日，親率大軍突襲香港，原以爲孤島無援，唾手可得，曾勒限所部兩日攻克，嗣因港島守軍奮力堅抗，延至同月十七日始獲登陸，憤恨之餘，兇殘念萌。自進駐港島後之半月中，幹縱部屬實行大規模之屠殺姦掠，藉以報復，而逞淫威。其有關香港軍事據點之英軍，加拿大軍及義勇軍，竟於繳械迎降，已成俘虜後，慘遭殺戮。如民國三十年十二月十七·十八兩日，在鯉魚門陸續屠殺俘虜三十餘人，在西環砲合屠戮俘虜二十四人，其姓名可稽者有英軍砲手麥當諾Macdonal及義勇軍郭姓等五人。同月十九日在赤柱半島慘殺已俘英兵古士林Gosling麥克次尼Mackechnie及義勇軍琳凱捷K.Lim，同月二十七日，在淺水灣余東旋別墅屠殺俘虜十五人，同月二十九日，在黃泥洞涌坳屠殺俘虜五十餘人。在淺水灣屠殺已俘英皇家蘇格蘭部隊多人，內有麥花臣中校Li.Col.Macpherson在深水灣屠殺已俘英軍「米杜息」Middlesex部隊官兵六人。所有前述被害俘虜，多係雙手反縛，背部悉遭槍刃刺斃，更有身首異處，顱破腦流，厭狀甚慘。至非軍事據點而純屬紅十字會救傷機關及傷兵醫院，不特所有已俘傷兵橫遭殺害，即從事救治之警官，護士亦復備受荼毒，如民國三十年十二月十九日，在筲箕灣天主教循道會附近屠殺迎降之英皇家陸軍醫隊隊員畢漢Buchan，屈特Watt，牛頓Newton，毛漢Mohan威廉Williams麥花Macforquhar，杜爾Dunne，力特Reid，蘭基理Langley，哈利臣Harrison，凱利，Kelly及一印度兵暨五華籍擔架員與奧羅夫醫生Dr.Oroff，羅臣准將Brig.Laurson，總計二十人左右，或係驅至水壩旁，悉以軍刀自背後猛刺倒斃，或則押往山麓，以機槍掃射，飲彈齊殞。同月廿四日至廿六日，在赤柱半島聖史蒂芬斯傷兵醫院St.Stephens　Hospital屠殺已俘傷兵六七十名及院內職員廿五名，其殺害手段、係就病牀挨次屠戮，刀劍砰轟與呻吟哀號交作，慘不忍聞。並輸姦院內護士戈登女士Miss.Gordon，費度夫人Mrs.Fidoe，西門思夫人Mrs.Simmons及四華婦。尙有史密士夫人Mrs.Smith，巴施丹夫人Mrs.Buxton及柏夫人Mrs.Begg，慘遭刴尸數段，血肉糢糊，其避人厠所之比勒中校Lt.Col.Black及威彌上尉Capt.Witney，亦仍被搜獲後，用刀劍亂刺殞命。又有加拿大步槍手麥克J.Mokay慘遭抉眼，削耳，割舌，凌遲致死。更在赤柱天主教瑪利諾教會附設之傷兵醫院，將已俘英籍傷兵三人自高樓擲出窗外，摔死於地。又將已俘受傷英籍官兵十二人悉予梟首，他若與軍事毫無牽涉之跑馬地藍塘道，爲我國人民萃居處所，亦分批前往，肆施暴行。如同月廿二日下午六時，在藍塘道二號屠殺居民四十八人，內有中央委員鄒魯之子鄒越，與交通部總務司司長謝奮程及汪仲長父子，並姦殺孕婦，輪姦年甫十二三歲之幼女，洗刦財物而去。同日縱騎馳赴南浦路四十二號，屠殺華籍居民三十餘人，我中央信託局職員麥佐衡亦同時被刺九刃，未及要害，倖獲逃生。此外，民國三十年十二月十八日及同月廿八日，先後在九龍粉嶺安樂村，强姦婦女多人，慘號之聲，入夜不絕。又唆縱狼犬哮咬行人，均屬慘無人道，再對於我國文化珍品，尤注意奪取，如進佔香港後，即唆令部屬宮木博少佐，率隊馳往般含道香港大學馮平山圖書館，搜刧國立中央圖書館所藏善本書籍一百十一箱，並將西環永安貨倉所有國立北平圖書館寄存之西文圖書雜誌二十箱一併刦去。種種暴行，不勝殫紀，於戰事結束後，經第十一戰區長官部緝獲，轉解本庭檢察官偵查起訴。</p>

<p>查本案被吿與梅津美治郎同爲來華實施日本侵略政策之主要人物，在天津駐屯軍步兵隊長及參謀長任內，即潔反國際公約、從事破壞我國行政及領土之完整。初則　使奸黨組織便衣隊，擾亂平津，並密設暗殺機州關，謀刺我黨政要員。繼以武力要脅我軍政當局，罷免河北省行政首長，並撤退河北駐軍，冀圖實現華北五省脫離中央單獨行使自治政權之主張。此項事實，匪特有前華北軍政長官迭次呈報我最高軍事當局之密電，前天津市長張廷諤歷述當時平津情况之電文，曁外交部第一〇〇五號代電，詳叙民國二十四年五月二十九日被吿與日本使館武官附　橋少佐偕往前軍事委員會北平分會提出强硬要求之文件，均可覆按。且經常時參與華北黨政調查工作之高興亞，到庭指證明晰。即核與“本軍官田中隆吉少將於本年七月九日在東京遠　國際法庭所供。「酒井大佐係梅津美治郎之屬員，乃主張使華北五省脫離中央政府，分別成立五單獨自治政權之最力者」等語，亦相脗合。（見附件甲）至被吿充任駐粵第二十三軍司令官時，如何編組和平軍扶植僞政權，並有僞廣東省長陳逆耀祖迭致汪逆兆銘陳逆　君呈報被吿部屬矢崎督導　政情形之密電附卷可證。次查被吿在廣東南海一帶作戰期內，縱部屠殺無辜村民蔡李氏湯帝祥等一百餘人，並濫施酷刑，虐殺婦孺，流放平民，掠刦財物，焚燬民房七百餘間，沒收禾田百餘畝各事實，已據目睹之證人湯騰·岑積·湯晚華。湯寳如。湯藻平。吳煒民。湯根·何馮氏·蔡薛氏·湯源作·曹鈺淸·謝德民·鄧文耀·周聰。湯遂方·蔡恒·潘昌。鄭烈民一李世來·盧宇明·湯兩·馮黃國賢·胡景文·譚永兆·湯滿成·湯深·袁宜生·古寳林·明夫毅。崔健南·謝星池·張鐸·梁陳氏·陳祐·陳洪·陳祖·湯澄·馮池·曾文峰·王德　·陳煥新·陳宰庭等，在廣東廣州地方法院分別具結證明。又在三水縣姦殺婦女二人，及在　崖將邢穀梅夫婦剖腹致死，亦各經人證章仙鰲邢詒江結證是實。（見附件乙）迨攻陷香港後，如何縱兵殘殺迎降之俘虜，　斃之傷兵，與從事救傷工作之紅十字會人員，如何用鐵圈銬手，並以抉目·削耳·割舌。梟首·刴屍等殘酷手段，爲殺害方法，以及如何　虐平民，輪姦婦女，洗刦財物各情，已據在塲目賭之證人李亞夫·奧詩禮·譚雅士·瑪利蘇發·張瑞齡·施文·根寗咸·史丹利馬田班夫·馬廿曹謙士·陳恩光·菲力。戈登女士·安德李詠夫人·菲士格特·安德遜麥克·賴廉士·嚴鴻林三賢·張飛烈·約翰威士利格倫·麥佐衡等，在駐港英國陸軍部檢察署宣誓證明，均立有官誓證書，由東南亞盟軍統帥派遣戰罪調查員楊德儀，駐港英國陸軍總司令部戰罪調查團團員顧爾伯少校，及加拿大陸軍第四軍區檢察處副裁判長兼加拿大奎　省最高法院專員佐列文都少校，分別連署簽證。（未完）</p>

<p>勿使物價騷動</p>
<p>物價總算穩定了一時，此伏彼起的工潮幸而平息了下來，突然晴天霹靂似的提高外匯率公佈了出來，各種物價無一不起了極大波動。當局提高外匯率，固然有其正大理由，而且經過許多專家鄭重硏討過，意在抑制美貨的傾銷，獎勵國貨的出口，杜塞國家漏巵，挽救垂危的國貨廠商，這眞可說是與國計民生有莫大關係。</p>
<p>然而擺在眼前的事實是怎樣？外貨固不必論，就是與外匯毫無關聯的貨物亦無不漲起幾成，甚至柴米油鹽連小菜塲裏的小菜都跟着漲起價來。儘管當局召集商人一再吿誡，然言者諄諄，聽者藐藐，又有什麼辦法？只是苦了以微薄薪水爲生的職工們，按月所入原已不敷支出，現在又打了個七折八扣，眞是令人欲哭無淚啊！</p>
<p>現在惟有籲請當局以毅然決然的手段，來壓定無理高漲的物價，否則前途隱憂方興未艾咧！</p>

<h3>一九四六年的蘇俄　克林姆宮一黨專政但不違反民意</h3>
<p>— 紐約時報駐蘇特派員阿金遜著　棟譯</p>
<p>要和蘇俄政府談友好，合作，我們就得放棄我們對於［友誼］慣用的觀念。我們平常以爲友誼是一種親密的關係，或是政治上善意的妥協－這樣的友誼，在對蘇關係中，旣不需要，又不可能，同時根本就不存在。因爲蘇政府是一架政治機器，各種人與人的辦法，用上去是行不通的。</p>
<p>大體上說，俄國人民是可以愛慕的－真誠，苦幹，講實踐，有力量，有常識，有勇氣。可是我們要和俄國人民發生關係非先與蘇政府發生關係不可。而這政府，不管它怎樣唱「民主」高調，實在是一個一黨專制的獨裁政府。所謂無產階級的專政，實踐上却是共黨政治局十三位委員的獨裁。</p>
<p>在蘇聯國內，根本沒有甚麼自由可談，據我所知，這個政府並不違反民意，同時也不腐敗，雖然國內也時有不正軌的事，如最近的工廠舞弊案和克里米亞謀反事，我的印像終是：蘇聯民衆大多信仰與尊敬他們的政府當局。</p>
<p>可是因爲本質上蘇政府就是一部機器，它的任務就是發電，從內向外儘量發動，所以一切以友誼爲出發點的對策，必敗無疑。我們和蘇聯雖然不是敵人，却也不是朋友；在幾年以內，我們至多只能達到一種「武裝和平」的關係。</p>
<p>爲達到目的　決不擇手段</p>
<p>對付蘇聯，碰到利害衝突，我們不得不採取他們慣用的強權政策。當然，這是極端反動的辦法，可是我們要認淸：蘇聯政府的精神根本就是反動的。這可以從它對戰敗國態度和紅軍在東北的作風見到。蘇政府對內旣然用慣了武力，對外也就自然而然這樣想了。一般看見過蘇聯這樣做法的西方人，都爲之戰慄不止。</p>
<p>爲什麽蘇聯這樣難以對付？原因當然很多。有一點就是現任的蘇聯領袖都是從暴力的路上起家。當革命的時候，他們就得隨時在仇視的環境爭取政權，直到現在，他們還相信一九一七年的作風是成功捷徑。在舊俄皇的暴政下，他們爲了革命工作　成絕對服從紀律的習慣，同時還學會了怎樣秘密活動。蘇領袖之所以有今日，就靠了這種警戒和服從紀律的辦法，他們深信再要擴大權威，也還得這樣做。</p>
<p>蘇政府當局的一個共同信仰，就是不擇手段以達到其目的，也許正因爲這個緣故，所以這有史以來的第一個社會主義國家，不但沒有解放工人，而且工人的勞力和思想倒反而都變成奴隸。</p>
<p>俄國革命，本來是一個大規模的地下工作。在地下策劃，用欺騙手段，用暴力，秘密地推動。這種作風至今都還存在，蘇政府仍然是一切保守秘密，外國人不知道蘇政府在做些甚麼，就是蘇聯人民也不見得曉得多。有時候，他們知道的簡直比外國人還少，因爲有些消息洩露到外國去。革命時代的暴力作風也存在，沒有人說得出究竟有幾百萬政治犯被禁在獄或遭放逐。一般的估計，約爲一千萬至一千五百萬，世界上沒有一個政府有這樣多的問題，等待解決；蘇政府不但要進行工業革命，還有政治革命，還要想有效而迅速的辦法敎育人民。</p>
<p>蘇政府的內政，可以說很有成績，但是一般領袖總覺得不安全，這一點是外國人很難看懂的。史達林恐怕是舉世警衛最森嚴的人了，在俄國，每一個公民與僑民都得隨時携帶身份證和護照，這種我們視爲戰時的措施，竟是蘇聯日常安全的保障。</p>
<p>蘇聯各地　尚無反抗行動</p>
<p>據我所知，沒有公開反抗蘇政府運動。進來盛傳島克蘭對現政府不滿，認爲島克蘭戰時所遭損失過大，政府應負全責。去冬十二月，蘇共黨大本營遭焚，一般認為是反蘇陰謀。不過蘇政府地位鞏固，對於一切反動都有制服能力。因為它領導蘇民抗戰勝利之大功。而共黨自然以大功自居，甚至於抹殺各盟國擊潰德國的貢獻，並且以戰敗日本自命。</p>
<p>除了有時候爲了生活艱苦而向政府責難外，一般人民都相信政府。可是蘇政府當局總還是覺得不安全。他們大概認為國家情形如此落後，要在短時間提高地位，他們應該有執行國策的全權，不容許人批評或反對。他們對內如此，對外也一樣，所不同者在國外他們沒有新聞統治的保障，也沒有禁止反對的辦法。</p>
<p>我們與蘇聯的困難，一部份還是因為蘇執政者的愚昧。他們大多都沒出國過，這樣孤立了多少年，對外養成一種病態的恐怖。蘇政府的精神就是排外，自一九三六年流血淸黨後，他們對於外國人總有一種莫名的畏懼，認為他們不是間諜便是敵人。因此蘇人民和外人接觸，即視為叛蘇，執政者也是如此，與外人來往過密，即有打下冷宮的危險。</p>
<p>一般人認為史達林是蘇聯政府中常識最豐富的一位。可是他對於自由，民主，也還是不懂。他對國外的認識多半根據他過去馬克斯主義之熏陶，和他現在駐外使節和新聞記者不公正的報導。蘇聯的領袖都吃「孤立」的　。儘管有關於國外資料，他們也沒有分析它的經驗。因為他們一向在「鐵幕」後過活，所以一切對外方面，他們就沒有一種我們認為正常的處　。</p>
<p>去年十二月莫斯科會議後，許多外國人都相信蘇聯的決策是回到戰前局面，認資本主義國家爲蘇聯必然敵人。在這種懼外的空氣裏，要統治人民自然容易得多。</p>
<p>蘇俄的空氣根本就不正常。孤立的結果，使它的思想文化陷於沉滯。新聞檢查的結果使得一般人對於傳聞都有神經病似的反響。譬如邱吉爾在美國演講，抨擊蘇聯。這段消息被扣了多少天，等到發表了，一般的反響情緒猛烈，好像原子彈就要擲下來似的，有了二次大戰的經驗，我們都熟知國際政治經濟之合作，爲唯一避免戰爭的途徑。可是蘇聯的經驗却吿訴我們舉世文化思想合作的重要。</p>
<p>蘇聯懼外心理實是神經過敏</p>
<p>在蘇聯沒有新思想，老是翻來覆去談些舊花樣。所有的報紙在同一天，說差不多一樣的話，用幾乎一樣的方式說，除去例外，每一個作家的作品都相仿。因為蘇政府的孤立排外政策，因為他厲行檢查新聞禁止新聞的公佈，所以蘇聯的文化變成一無生氣而拘泥習俗。</p>
<p>我不懂科學，所以不能評斷蘇俄的工業。我只知道，蘇俄藝術水準很低，　各方面的觀察，我自　可以正確地說，蘇聯戲劇　　和音樂的水準都低。我疑心蘇聯人自己也覺悟到這一點。大體上說，蘇聯的文藝沒有一點朝氣，同時也已經　了　死的狀態。在政治的　　　力之下，人民很少有機會去發　個性。在這種不正常的空氣中，一切精神病態都滋長起來。最不合理的就是蘇政府當局的病態似的恐懼，他們甚麼都怕，以為人人是敵人，恐怕隨時有被包圍襲擊的危險。而其實呢？以蘇俄版圖之大，資源之富，人民之有膽識，這種心理實在一點根據也沒有。</p>
<p>在美國盛行着一種老生常談，認為蘇聯的當局是一班非常利害的傑出人材，可是我認為他們實在是庸庸碌碌，不懂得民主，對於民主國家的一舉一動又看不清楚。</p>
<p>國際關係不和睦的根本原因是：蘇聯是一個社會主義的國家，正在一個資本主義的世界裏謀發展，求出路。照共黨看法，只要資本主義國家如英美也和蘇聯一樣的處於統治地位，蘇聯就有被侵略的危險。</p>
<p>現在，共黨的看法是照樣：「獨佔資本」之法西斯，爲法西斯主義保存勢力以備打到社會主義。蘇聯的報紙將美國描寫成一個用武力的帝國主義國家，向世界上各方面擴充勢力，侵犯弱小國家的主權。美國的「獨佔資本家」呢？他們是舉世愛好和平的民衆的敵人。</p>
<p>國際一週</p>
<h3>一連串的國際會議　一連串的國際問題</h3>
<p>— 储玉神</p>
<p>戰後的世界政局，雖然天天在動亂之中；但是波瀾迭起，從來沒有像這一週的洶湧，大有一波未平，一波又起之勢。烏克蘭代表曼紐斯基，於上星期中，突然致函聯合國大會秘書長雪伊，對於希臘與阿爾巴尼亞兩國不斷發生邊界衝突，向聯合國安全理事會，控訴希臘危害和平。並指謫英軍留駐希臘境內，干涉希臘內政，造成巴爾干半島擾攘不安的局面。這一個晴天霹靂，不管是向巴黎和會投一個炸彈，使廿一國的代表，都驚慌失措，不知如何應付。但是安全理事會，也只得將此申訴列入廿八日會議的議程內。蘇聯在外交上的反攻，從此揭開其序幕了。</p>
<p>四國外長　重開會議</p>
<p>巴黎和會開了三十天的會議，只聽到各國代表的宏論，但是毫無成就；而各國代表所提出的和約修正案，堆積如山。達二百五十件之多，單以對議和約草案而論，幾乎沒有一條不要修正，假定這些修正案，都要提出來討論，聼由各國代表自由發表意見，則和會開到本年年底，恐怕還不能「圓滿閉幕」，但是客觀的國際環境，又不容許和會如此拖延下去，第一，聯合國大會定於九月廿三日在紐約開幕，因此這兩個重要的國際會議是否同時舉行？也就成了嚴重問題。依照目前的情形而論，英美兩國代表主張和會與聯合國大會同時舉行，蘇聯則認為聯合國大會唯有在和會結束之後始能舉行；中法兩國適居其間，主張和會在聯合國大會期間，慢慢進行工作。所以，無論如何，和會在聯合國大會期間，將喪失其重要性，至少國際視綫要分散了。故和會在聯合國大會開幕之前，應該設法加緊工作。第二歐洲與遠東，在現行國際關係之下，息息相通，歐洲的僵局打不開，遠東問題也就不能早日解決，對義·羅·匃·保·芬五國和約如不能成立，對日和會即無從產生，所以為整個世界的前途計，巴黎和會實有加緊工作早日完成任務的必要。</p>
<p>安全理會　又起爭執</p>
<p>聯合國安全理事會也於本月廿八日在紐約開會，先討論若干非會員國要求加入聯合國機構的問題。要求加入聯合國機構的國家，有阿富汗，冰島，瑞典，外約但，南愛爾蘭，葡萄牙，阿爾巴尼亞，曁外蒙古等八國。美國代表約翰生會主張這八個國家一律許其入會，但為蘇聯代表葛羅米柯反對，並主張分別處理，因此安全理事會的聯合國機構會員國資格審查委員會，乃開始工作，首先一致通過，准許阿富汗，冰島暨瑞典三國加入聯合國機構後來討論其餘五國要求入會的問題，各國的意見紛歧，又引起爭執，使這五個國家，都未能如願以償。</p>
<p>在這些申請入會的國家中，最惹人注意的，就是外蒙古。她獲得蘇聯與烏克蘭邦的支撑，向聯合國安全理事會，申請入會，聯合國秘書處會以外蒙古情形不甚明瞭，尚待調查，提出三項問題，請其答覆；中國代表也要求安全理事會暫緩討論；但是蘇聯代表一再堅持，我們也就放棄前議，在投票表決的時候，中蘇投贊成票，英美投反對票，使外蒙古仍未能獲准加入聯合國機構。</p>
<p>控訴希臘　英荷反對</p>
<p>烏克蘭邦代表曼紐斯基，對於希阿兩國邊境衝突，向安全理事會控訴希臘，危害世界和平，但是當這個問題提出安全理事會討論的時候，首先遭遇到英荷兩國的反對，都說烏克蘭代表控訴希臘，理由旣不充分，證據也不足夠。蘇聯代表雖要求邀請希臘與烏克蘭兩國代表到會陳述意見，但亦各國代表所反對。因此這個控訴，也就擱淺了。</p>
<p>每週一人</p>
<h3>老當益壯的蕭伯納</h3>
<p>— （溪節譯自「紐約時報」）</p>
<p>九十髦齡老當益壯的蕭伯納翁依然不減當年風趣－－那犀利的詞鋒，柔和的微笑，挺直的姿態，依然是那樣率直的思想家，永遠是思想上的叛徒。</p>
<p>他的生活嚴肅而有規律，他的生活習慣跟四十年前的大同小異。只是你不再會看見他乘了自動腳踏車兜圈子，或者在　衆面前演說；你不會撞見他拼擋行李，準備作環球之行；你也不會看見他在早上作游泳的練習。這一切他早已放棄不幹了，因為他有別的事情幹，他一天的工作是挺緊張的，他覺得再要幹那些玩意兒是年齡太大了，同時他覺得處理世界上的錯綜複雜的人事却又嫌年齡不夠大。他開始一件工作以後　要經過長時期繼能夠完成它。等到那件工作完成時，他又吿訴我們要做別的什麽事情了。</p>
<p>蕭翁所最不感興趣的問題，便是關於死的事情。他的活力實在太充沛了，那裏會顧慮到這些事情上面去呢？有許多早已死去的人物－－　惠廉莫理斯·南森·王爾德·華格納·羅亭等－－經過他三言兩語的點染，就栩栩如生了。這些人在他看來是仍然活着的。他雖然隱居在窮鄉僻壤，與世隔絕，但是實際上他仍舊廁身於世事的核心，而從未離開過它。</p>
<p>蕭翁是一個樂天家。他對於人生的看法是全然樂觀的。他曾經說過：「人生不管它是幸福或悲苦，成功或失敗，總是非常有趣的。」</p>
<p>請看他每天的生活吧，他以濃郁的興趣開始他的一天工作。他起身得很早，非到深夜是不去睡覺的。他每晚必收聽各地電台的新聞報導，一字不肯輕易放過。不論晴雨，下雪或發風潮，他一定跑到他花園盡頭的那間小屋子裏去工作，在那裏靜靜地坐着執筆寫作，一直到中午為止。飯後在臥榻上閉目靜養片刻。逢到工作特別忙的時候，他就犧牲睡午覺。晚上他總是　坐在安樂椅裏，讀報看　以自遣，或者津津有味的收聽無綫電裏的音樂，或談話節目。</p>
<p>蕭翁雖然歡喜一個人關在屋子裏續書寫文，可是他的生活不是寂寞的。他時常與舊地對他的友好說：「我在開始寫一本新的戲劇！」實在世人也正在殷切地盼望他寫作一些新的創作出來。</p>
<p>他是個現實主義者，他從不悲觀，從不失望。他認為一切世事都有挽救的希望，他覺得他本人就有許多缺點需要改正。他覺得人類只要有決心，也可以同樣挽救它的許多缺點。他曾經多方試探想挽救人類，他屢次嘲笑我們，但是仍抱着遠大的希望，自信他的見解是不錯的。他隨時準備着聽取科學家·說教家·藝術家和哲學家的意見，集思廣益以冀覓取拯救人類的房策。如蕭翁者，可說是真正勇敢的鬥士了。</p>
<p>蕭伯納在研正究創製一種省時省力的新文字。他認為言語和文字應當像鳥類的鳴叫一樣簡單而能達意。</p>
<p>當筆者看見蕭翁的高大挺直的影子時，或者當他安開地坐着從談世事時，我得到一種新的時代意識，需要簡單而目標遠大的時代意識。他也許並沒有達成他的理想，可是他已經用他的嬉笑怒嘯使我們前進了一步。</p>

<h3>軌跡</h3>
<p>— 洪為法</p>
<p>一個人的升沉榮辱，常同賭博一樣的碰運氣，而在文人方面更是如此。譬如：</p>
<p>「　府初遇，以李大亮劉泊之　，太宗召令詠島。義府曰，日裏颺朝彩，琴中聞夜啼；上林如許樹，不偕一枝樓。帝曰，與卿全樹，何止一枝。」（唐詩紀事卷四）</p>
<p>這是李義府的故事。</p>
<p>「明島以張說之　，召浩然令誦所作。乃誦北闕休上書，南山歸敝廬。不才明主棄，多病故人疎。白髮催年老，靑陽逼歲除。永懷愁不寐，松月夜窗虛。帝曰，鄉不求朕，豈朕棄卿？何不云氣蒸雲　澤，波動岳陽城。因是故　。」（唐詩紀事卷二十三）</p>
<p>這是孟浩然的故事。其實「上林如許樹，不借一枝樓」，和「不才明主棄」，說是都有怨望之意固可，說是都有希位之意也可。可是一遇太宗，一遇明皇，便一升一沉，一榮一辱了。因爲升沉榮辱之權，操在人家手裏，但憑人家的一時好惡，自然沒有什麼軌跡可尋的。這沒有軌跡可尋的事，如是時時縈擾在心頭，就會悲哀怨懃，增加自己毁滅的速度。</p>
<p>初唐四傑之一的盧照隣，就其身世說，自然是很可悲憫的。據舊唐書上說，他「因染風疾去官，處太白山中，以服餌爲事。後疾轉篤，徙居陽翟之具茨山，著釋疾文五悲等誦，頗有騷人之風，甚爲文士所重。照隣旣沉痼　廢，不堪其苦，嘗與親屬執別，遂自投頴水而死。時年四十」。這是如何慘痛的一幕悲劇的下塲！可是新唐書上却說「照隣自以常高帝時尙吏，己獨儒、武后尙法，己獨黃老；后封嵩山，屢聘賢士，己已廢。著五悲文以自明。病旣久，與親屬訣，自沉頴水濱」。如是這樣的說，他很慘痛的毁滅了自己，固是不勝風疾之苦，也和他念念不忘那沒有軌跡可尋的升沉榮辱有絕大的關係。這眞是徒自苦惱了。</p>
<p>漢武故事上說：「上嘗　至郎署，見一老，髭鬍皓白，衣服不完。上問曰，公何時爲郎，何其老矣！對曰，臣姓顏名駟，江都人也，文帝時爲郎。上問曰，何不遇也？駟曰，文帝好文，君好武；景帝好老，臣又少；陛下好少，臣已老：是以三世不遇」。野客叢書上說：「此事與馮唐絕類。白帖云，漢文帝時，馮唐白首爲郎。帝問之，對曰，臣三朝不遇」。不管是顏駟或是馮唐，他們這種不自怨艾，我行我素的精神，看來總是値得令人贊佩的。忠實於文藝的文人們，我想，該還是沿着自己的軌跡前進罷！</p>
<h3>教授與女兒（小說）</h3>
<p>— 石碚</p>
<p>今天中午，孫教授從學校上了課回來，要步行四里多路才能回到這間屋子裏；這間屋子是在一個小村子的邊緣，一排低低的籬笆，圍着屋前的一角菜地；屋子側邊一株樟樹下面，有一個　　的木籠子；靠近牆壁豎着幾排晒衣的竹杆，這些都是孫教授和女兒梅菁來後，才弄得比較　齊起來的。</p>
<p>村子離學校雖遠，然附設的先修班在這裏，且每隔三天，附近鄕人都到這裏趕集，所以在禮拜天和逢趕集的日子，這裏便顯得熱鬧起來。村子裏桂樹和楓樹特別多，還有前村的一條小河，兩岸都有密密的水楊，夏天綠蔭掩蓋，河水就像一條碧綠色的玉石一般。孫教授的屋于正是靠近河畔，若以愛好田園風光的人看來，這裏到是頂淸雅的地方，但是一些住慣都市洋房的人★就連叫他踏進一步去都不情願的了。</p>
<p>因爲戰事的影響，孫教授從華中沿海，流浪到南方的邊陲去，有一年在逃難途中，太太病故，大兒子人川在一所大學裘唸書。現在這的只剩下十六歲的梅　伴着他。</p>
<p>在學校裏，他担任英國文學史和英詩選讀的課程，每天淸早便要到學校去上課；他曾經在課室裏對學生們說：「大風雨的天氣，我仍是照常來，只有在風雨中遇有雷電的天氣，我才不出門，你們上課可以依這　的時間爲準。因爲在風雨雷電下，要在郊外跑上四五里路，是有危險的。一說話時，他帶着笑，但是這實在是他上課的準則。</p>
<p>現在他照常拖着一根退了色的咖啡色的手杖，一邊手提着一隻裝着一卷英文講義和四五十張學生點名卡的布袋子，還有一個油　，已慢慢走近家了。他雖已是過了五十歲的人，但精神　鑠，　健的脚步，一步一步地像要量出預定的度數來，他的儀容和　是十足一個英國老紳士的樣子。</p>
<p>「阿梅！飯燒好了沒有？」孫教授走進　子，把手上的東西放好了，轉身出門　，望着正在　衣的女兒說。</p>
<p>「　　好了，爸爸，我還替你　了　　　蛋呢！等着你買油回來，我一炒菜，便可吃飯了……：你歇歇，我去倒杯茶給你。梅菁沒有把衣服完全晒好，一面用圍裙擦乾濕漉漉的手，一面輕快的走進屋子裏。</p>
<p>她端了杯茶出來給父親，再去將盤子裏的衣服扭乾搭在竹杆上，才回去炒菜。</p>
<p>時間已是十二時半，太陽灼辣辣地照着，沒有一點兒風，他在學校的工作和回到家裏所過的生活，就像這天氣一般沉重悶熱。　呷了一口茶，汗珠便從額角上滴下來了，梅菁剛才在門外轉來轉去的背影，現在又活動在於子裏；他默默地看着，雖然他從米沒有對女兒提過他內心對她的感觸，但是每當看見女兒淸瘦的影子，他內心就劃下了一條創痛的傷痕。這是他不能明白地說出的，也不知道什麼時候這條傷痕能够痊愈。</p>
<p>他坐在門前的矮櫈子上，用手帕抹抹額上和臉上的汗；古紅色的兩頰肌肉，像如來佛的長耳朵　捲地向下垂落，這是從前曾經很豐滿過的，現在是打摺起來了。斑白髮髭下的厚嘴唇，輕微地嘆了一聲。</p>
<p>轉過面望着女兒晒在竹竿上的衣服，這些都是給先修班裏的學生所洗的，學生包洗每月的工錢是八百元，起初他本來不准女兒變成了一個洗衣女，但是爲了生活的緣故，且女兒生成就是一個勤懇的孩子，獃在家裏，總想找一些工作做才覺得舒服，同是希望用她自己的勞力獲得一些報酬，帮助父親。在這樣的情形中，他雖然不答應也已成了事實，現在梅菁已經包洗十多個學生的衣服了。</p>
<p>他看見漬水從袖口和衣衾的邊緣，一滴一滴地掉下來，像打落在他心上的一顆一顆冷淸的淚珠，漸漸他痛楚地睜大了眼睛注視着，站起來想跑去替女兒將衣服扭乾一點，但是他看見籬笆外面走過來人影，下意識地呆住了一刻，便驀然的坐在櫈上，額上的汗像爭綻的花朶，溢出滾下，溢出滾下。……</p>
<p>「爸爸！開飯了！」梅菁在屋子裏高聲叫，一些碗碟移動的聲音也傳了出來。</p>
<p>「爸！……」</p>
<p>「哦！我來了！」</p>
<p>「爸，你看這兩隻蛋是我們的母雞生的，這些小白菜是前十天撒下種子，我把菜秧移植開去，不到幾天就有這麼大了，一過了油鍋，便綠得像貓兒的眼睛一樣！」</p>
<p>他沒有說話，脫下被熱飯蒙上水氣的眼鏡，將那碟蛋轉移到女兒的面前。</p>
<p>「爸，今天你不高興嗎？」</p>
<p>「沒有，……你多吃點蛋。」</p>
<p>剛才門外的情景，繼續連成一條深刻的印象，在刺激着他。</p>
<p>黃昏的時候，輕風從河堤的水楊樹蔭間吹到這裏來，輕輕括過樟樹的葉子，發出沙沙響音；遠大的雲彩，該是給晚節遲暮的人生，劃出多少的瑰麗吧！</p>
<p>這時孫教授顯出悠閒的樣子，坐在樟樹下的竹躺椅上，抽着捲烟，已經是接連抽第三根了。</p>
<p>梅菁穿着一件二年前穿過的白底印有小藍花點的長衣但是這二年人長得快，衣服已不大合身了，正因爲如此，她天眞活潑的性情也回到幾年前的小孩子一般。她從屋子裏挾了一本厚厚的父親的舊相簿出來，手上還拿了一杯茶走到爸爸的椅邊。</p>
<p>「爸爸，你看這相簿的封面已經掉了，我們那年離開厦門後，便沒有再翻看過這個本子了，」梅菁坐下在父親旁邊的櫈子，翻開了相簿，擱到躺椅放手的橫架上。</p>
<p>梅菁最珍愛着這本相簿，在裏而藏着她金色童年閃閃的光輝，和紀錄了父親夢一般的過去生涯踪跡。孫教授也愛從這本相簿裏，回憶着過去的歡樂。從許多照片上，他愛講述從前他在國外時期的生活，或老親歷見聞的異國風光習俗，這些是梅菁永遠聽不厭的具有無限新奇的吸引力的東西，孫教授也可暫時溶進舊趣的歡愉裏面。所謂人生的超脫，有時也實在是對無法獲得的樂趣，能在旁人的叙述上得了想像上的滿足，或者是在對已消逝的樂趣，能在眼前歷歷重現。這兩個父女便是在這時候獲得了最高的慰藉。</p>
<p>他們談着有趣的話，看滿殘舊美麗的照片·黃昏的凉風，吹動他們斑白的頭髮和烏黑的長髮相依在一起，只有這樣的傍晚，他們才能够忘記了白天生活的沉重和苦楚，但是這樣的時間，也不過是瞬息停留罷了，隨即便是黑夜的影子走上來了。</p>
<p>「阿梅，你先去睡吧，我還要改些練習本子。」</p>
<p>「爸，你也得早點去睡呀！」</p>
<p>當這兩句對話說過後，屋外樹下，父女的影子便不見了·</p>
<p>平時梅菁也像父親一樣忙着，洗衣，種菜，飼雞，和家常的雜務，都是她一個人主持；她不厭工作的繁忙，因爲近來父親回家時常常是帶着沉默憂鬱的樣子，所以她更裝出活潑高興；她知道是這樣才可以减輕父親的煩惱，從前她曾經想過：——爲什麼爸爸是一個留學生，也當了十多年大學教授，但是自己連受教育的機會都被剝奪呢？這種思想早被現在的工作驅走了。跟着父親流浪多年，她已經不是一個只會撒嬌的女孩子。</p>
<p>但是父親的憂鬱還是沒有减少，當第二天黎明，他醒在床上還沒有起來的時候，便聽見女兒在河畔浣衣的濤聲。他想喊一聲「阿梅」，但聲音到了喉嚨又被咽下去了。</p>
<p>太陽升起來，朝露舖滿草徑，孫教授緩慢的脚步，正朝着學校的方向走去。</p>
<h3>門外</h3>
<p>— 浩然</p>
<p>在盛夏的火熱的太陽下。像駱駝一般地跋涉過千山和萬水，我，總算是安然到達闊別九年的故居的門前。刹時間，我的精神異常緊張，我的熱血滾滾沸騰，好像一個久居市井的小民，踏進專制帝王的深宮一樣，在那嚴肅和靜穆的空氣中，我深深地感到自身的渺小。的確，似乎我已不再是這座屋子的主人了，吾則爲什麼猶豫再四，踟蹰不前呢？</p>
<p>門外，這周遭的一切，總該不算是生疎的吧！至少，在過去着十次糢糊的夢境中，還留下一片依稀的印象。經過無數次凄風苦雨的摧殘，和每日的夕陽殘照的燻　，門板上的紅漆是一塊一塊地剝落了，適和我想像中的可能的情景相同。但是那兩顆亮晶晶的大銅環還是緊緊地鑲在門上，神釆燦然，閃閃有光，有如一雙正在守望着遠方的巨眼。我伸手輕輕一摸，接着又收縮回來，因爲我深怕有損它的威嚴，銅環呀！你不是曾響徹了我童年底夢嗎？如今爲什　反而默默無言？</p>
<p>門外，這一塊半圓形的微微隆起的水門汀踏脚地，過去曾做過多少乞丐的臨時的溫床，如今依舊是潔白而穩固的，它面上的每一個方格，每一道錢條，在我的記憶裏都是熟悉的。身臨於這種地帶，即不要升堂入室，我已感覺到一種外界所未有的溫馨！因爲進入了這道門，裏面就是我的家，家，精神的尾闆啊！家，快樂的泉源！</p>
<p>我忐忑不安地兀立着，我心裏想像着重逢初見時的一幕緊張而親熱的塲而。我必須愛惜這一幕塲面，使它永遠鐫刻在我心版的深處，即歷一生一世，亦不忘懷！是夢？是幻？還是鐵一般的現實？此刻我又有一點懷疑了，因爲在無數個夢幻的情景裏，我也有過門外鵠立的經騐。於是，我轉過頭來，望着對面的修理汽車的小店舖，望着兩邊的一排修長而失神的梧桐樹，望着泥路上駛過汽車後所捲起的一片灰塵。</p>
<p>不知受了一種什麼力量的驅使，我突然猛省我所站的地方正在炎炎的火傘下，我渾身　受萬把銀針的陣陣刺激，大汗已經透過一層汗衫，使襯衫也有一點潤濕。而且，有一個路警曾對於我舉手無措的遲疑的神情投來注視的眼光、我已不能再欣賞這門外的景物了，於是顧手撳一下電鈴，預備着讓我相見不相識的弟妹，出來驚問客人的尊姓和大名。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風22</p>
<p>這種情形，至多不到五分鏡，槍聲已停、忽然看見卡車前面的探路燈又亮了。</p>
<p>「老伯！快來！」小孩的尖嗓子叫着·</p>
<p>我還沒跑近卡車，小老虎已經迎了上來，接力賽跑的式子，把手槍遞了給我，我看見他另外一隻手上似乎還抓着一隻盒子砲似的。</p>
<p>「　這兒拾掇拾掇，我還得追上一陣，走了好幾個鬼子呱。」話沒說完，人已跑了。</p>
<p>「拾撥！」是孩子給我的命令，我應當儘快儘好的做得他滿意；萬一又有一卡車的鬼子軍追過來呢？</p>
<p>儘快的試明了卡車，除了車頭頂上的燈已經燬壞之外、其他都沒動；可以行駛。　最明白簡單的語句，對車夫的說明鬼子軍已被攆走；叫兩個人來把車上的駕駛員尸體搬下去扔了。（這大的是小老虎第一槍的成績）。又叫他們把所有的傷兵搬到卡車上。我們扯去了車上蕩着的一而太陽旗，換上一塊白手絹；避免國軍哨崗的誤會。</p>
<p>「死了的怎麼辦，老總爺？」衆口嘈雜的問我。</p>
<p>「也給搬上，祗要是咱們人的。…快…你們都是有愛國心呀的！」我鼓勵着他們。</p>
<p>我看見有多一半的車夫臉上糢糊的一片，我知道那是被刺刀刺破，或槍托子搗破的傷口上流出的血；也是「皇軍」勇武的成績，還有一步一蹶的；想必是腿上受了傷。</p>
<p>「給鬼子打哪？」我問身邊一顚一　走過的車夫。</p>
<p>「對哪您哪，…這幾天，天天有，俺就是不會放檢哪，還能不拉傷兵？」</p>
<p>聽這說話口氣，好像他們這稱行動，是義務性質似的。「不能吧，還能不吃飯？」我心下自問自答濟。</p>
<p>「該多少錢，我來給罷！」我預備　　了。</p>
<p>「錢？咱們打不了鬼子，還能不愛國啦嗎？」很倔強的答覆了我給他們的侮辱。</p>

<h3>交通交通</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>上海交通情況之惡劣，無過於今日的了。這情形不僅是我們徒步的小民所深深感到，即坐汽車的市長大人亦復深切了解。</p>
<p>憑天良，環境複雜，經費拮据，市民的公德成問題，困難重重，要改善不是一朝一夕的事。然而，人們會記起一八一九年貝多芬—一個蓋世的偉大音樂家在維也納市政府所講的話：</p>
<p>「我願證明，凡是行為善良與高尚的人，定能因之而擔當患難。」</p>
<p>對於全體市民切身安全這一交通問題，已不知煩凟清聽過若干次，其所以然者，無非認為第一責任在市政當局。甚至我們想，上海市政當局之失職與否，可以用交通作試金石；甚至我們想，租界時期如何，收回的現在又如何，請稍稍顧全一點體面，另讓人家訕笑罷！</p>
<p>我們不敢說是我們囉哆的成效，我們祇能想那是市政當局懷之有素，近若干天來，當局的努力，跑過南京路四川路口，以及南京路西藏路口的人，都能侃侃而談，證明有計劃的在決心整頓積極改善。</p>
<p>據說：警察局長宣鐵吾先生，曾經在軍校畢業同學聚餐會上說：</p>
<p>「假使軍車再不領牌照行駛，請諸位莫怪我不顧同學的關係！」</p>
<p>這一辦事認眞的態度，配合了公用局的度劃，也是使本市交通能逐漸走上正軌的一個主要原因。我們不僅讚美，也同樣願意支持市政民、當局在這方面的努力！</p>
<p>市政府剛開始在做，能做就値得我們謳歌，但我們願意保留最大的歡呼在做出成績之後。</p>
<h3>扒手內幕</h3>
<p>— 金路</p>
<p>當你發覺袋裏的財物，不翼而飛的時候，你不必懊惱，最適當的辦法是下次當心！</p>
<p>本市警察局老閘分局，最近捉到「扒手」五十二名，其中男女老幼，均各齊備。為促進市民注意起見，在該局空地舉行了一次摸竊技術大表演，倒也新鮮有趣，大開眼界。據說竊方法，竟有十幾種之多。</p>
<p>「扒手」可分為二大類：專司扒錢的叫「爪子」；專推擠人或掩蔽動作的叫「幌子」。在某種場合，好多「爪子」單獨行動，不用帖子幫忙。而且「爪子」大多衣冠楚楚，樣子很像「小開」；「幌子」總是看上去令人生厭的傢伙。凡是熱門的地方，暗黑的場所，都是這些「專家」們因技巧不同，又可分為「褲袋手」，「蒼蠅」，「錶袋手」和「啤酒手」等。</p>
<p>「褲袋手」是扒手業中技倆最神妙的大亨，手脚極其靈巧。「蒼蠅」是專門偷開女人手提包的角色，大多混在百貨公司和其他熱門的大鋪子裏做着生意。「錶袋手」就專門扒竊男人的外衣袋內的東西。最別脚的，要算「啤酒手」，所謂「啤酒」，對象是醉漢及睡熟了的旅客；幹這生意的扒手，根本不需要什麼技倆，所以這也就是做扒手的第一階梯。</p>
<p>「扒手」扒竊方法，也跟時代而進步。有時，他們還是一個很好的心理學家。他們常在黏有「謹防扒手」的地方徘徊，因為人家看見這種標語時，總要去摸摸自己的袋袋，錢越帶得多，這種感應也越快。這就等於吿訴扒手：「我的錢放在這裏。」美國康城的偵探，有一次發現「扒手」們開了一爿專賣領帶的店，價錢特別的賤，當顧客擁擠時，店員就喊道：「當心扒手」。聖路易城的火車站上，有一小販的氣球，一失手飛到空中去了，人家都被氣球吸引住，仰着頭望空中，於是「扒手」乘機大肆活動。</p>
<p>「扒手」們也拜「老頭子」，河水不犯井水，各有各的地段；所以有時也能把贓物查出來。有時你給扒了重要的文件，在他們得了一無所用時，要是裏面恰有你一張名片的話，附逆民會按址郵寄給你。這是扒手「道德」。</p>
<p>「扒手」們的最好「肥肉」，要算是老年紀人，眫子，近視眼，或一個帶了好幾個小孩的人。</p>
<p>我們出門時，除了要用的錢外，身邊最好不要多帶。總之，你要隨時留意。在人堆中，一被人推擠時；或有人用報紙等掩護物塞過來遮住你視線時；或有人向你借火點煙，身體料靠過來時，就得加以注意和防範；不要以為他像個體面的上等人，因為你祇憑外表的衣着觀察對方，是會上當的。</p>
<p>親愛的讀者，當心扒手！</p>
<h3>預言</h3>
<p>— 起賢</p>
<p>各電車大站如大馬路外灘·西摩路·白渡橋·……等，將有人設置大批輕便旅行凳或藤椅，以供輕便電車乘客休息，每位收費五十元或一百元。乘客「坐等」之便，而設置椅凳者亦收入可觀，皆大歡喜。</p>
<p>人力車三輪車淘汰後，將有新式橡皮電車到滬，車廂富伸縮性，較現有電車容量，可增加三五倍。</p>
<h3>重負</h3>
<p>— 非零作</p>
<h3>希望善用保甲</h3>
<p>— 尤勁</p>
<p>旣有保甲的組織，我希望能夠善為利用。</p>
<p>現在甲長是誰，人民大槪還能指名道姓，至於誰是保長，隨便拿一個保民來問問，恐怕要瞠目不知所云了。</p>
<p>我有幾位朋友，是當甲長的，他們也異口同聲的說：「我們只有在今年一月間，調查戶口時，做過一點事，現在，只有保長和區公所發生關係，甲長是有名無實的。」</p>
<p>這現象的造成，當然因為有善用保甲。</p>
<p>比如糖的平賣，為什麼不利用保甲，來一次普遍而公平的配售，卻一定要轉手商人呢？白糖共糖，到了商人手裏，就一齊變了「黑糖」。請看本月二日的報上，不是有一則「黑心商人私售配糖，續有十家受懲，希望市民隨時檢舉」的新聞嗎？前有六家受懲，現有十家受懲，這是調查後而發現的，但未經調查，未經發現的，誰知道還有多少家呢？白糖變了黑糖，人民嘗不到一些甜味，還希望人民來做檢舉工作；這希望固然是不錯，但只吃酸·苦·辣，不吃甜味的人民，未免苦上加「辛」了。</p>
<p>所以我希望凡是平賣的東西，還不如來利用保甲，依照戶口配售。比如我住在十五區裏，全區有三五七一八戶，一七八四一一口。全市各區的戶口，當然也是清清楚楚，配售起來，不是公公平平，而且爽爽快快嗎？旣省人民的檢舉，又免當局的調查。難道不信任區保甲長，恐怕他們「併吞六國」呢？還是因為商人的財還發不足呢？</p>
<h3>最有趣事情</h3>
<p>— 小怡</p>
<p>桃拉塞費由絲是一個出名的編大眾歌曲家，小時很頑皮，在小學六年級的時候，有一次先生要她為一篇作文以「我生平所見最有趣之事」為題目。她寫了一分鍾就交卷，先生拿過她的卷子一看，上面寫着：「我生平所見最有趣的事情有趣得形容不出來。」</p>
<h3>連環漫畫　三毛從軍記（九二）</h3>
<p>— 張樂平作</p>
<h3>補白</h3>
<p>— 索貝</p>
<p>花花世界，玻璃上海，迷人的地方太多，迷人的事情太多，但是，我想了半天，最可珍貴的東西只有兩個：智識與健康。前者充實人生，使你不至於空空地來，悄悄地去，後者給你比較多的時間去充實人生。科學家的意見，我們不只活數十年，但是為了過分享受，過分「傷心」，我們是這樣短命，不免冤枉，我們不能不企求健康。但是光是做牛也太無意義，健康之外必須曉得最多　，懂得最多；如果問生命是什麼？答案該是：「智識加健康」。</p>
<h3>漫談長壽的人</h3>
<p>— 甘來</p>
<p>著名生物學家波芝洪氏會在一九三五年間，發表其研究結果：認為人壽標準，應為長成期的七倍。例如馬，須四年半方為長成，所以它的平均壽命，也恰為三十年。人到二十，方為成年，應活至一百四十歲。可是實際上，人類的壽命，遠低於這個標準，一般生物及醫學家的意見，多認為由於勞心，勞力太過所致。</p>
<p>今年三月二十六日，莫斯科公佈：蘇聯科學家已完成長命血清一種，能使人類衰老的速率降為緩慢，經若干年代後，可望使人類普遍的壽命延長為一百至一百五十歲。這種血清名為ACS，功能保存連續人體細胞與血管間的結締組織，刺激細胞活動，藉以幸各機構的工作，而延長壽命。這種血清，已經超過試騐階段，正在蘇聯各地普遍使用。</p>
<p>倘若有成效的話，那末，不單「七十古來稀」一類話要被推翻，「五代同堂」也將不足為奇了。</p>
<p>過去四五十年間，各國曾有不少的「長壽者」，如蘇聯外高加索的「亞布卡齊亞」地方，年逾百稀的壽翁，就有好幾位：年歲最老的一位是居於格伐達村的埃眞蘇亞，竟達一百五十七歲。其次要推加里鎭的格斯巴，年一百三十二歲，他共有子孫一百零二人，他一手創造了一個市鎭。再次便輪到卡爾達克伐村的夏茲巨克夫，他外貌不過六十歲光景，其實已經活了一個世紀零二十六年，他曾創作小說幾種，并且是一個勇敢的獵人。</p>
<p>埃及年齡最高的人，名喚瑪克甫，在一九三五年九月一日去世，享年一百五十三歲，他當八十歲時，曾產下一個兒子，在瑪氏逝世時，他的兒子也已經七十三歲。</p>
<p>我加也曾經有一位壽翁，是一個名叫王道常的開封人，他在民國二十四年時，已有一百零八歲，耳目聰明，精神頗佳，每餐食饅頭一斤，現在是否仍留人間，無法得知。</p>
<p>至於「第一長壽國」的稱號，卻歸於保加利亞所得。保國人口不過六百萬，而年在百歲以上的壽翁，據該國官方正式調查得知，卻有一百六十二人，這種「人瑞」的百分率，實在是空前。這些保加利亞的壽翁，有幾點頗值得研究：（一）這一百六十二人盡系農人，且多數是山區中的牧人。（二）他們的身軀並不高大。（三）他們結婚的年齡都是在二十至二十五歲之間。（四）這些壽翁當中，終身不食肉者佔百分之九十五，（五）他們大都嗜酒，不飲酒的祇有百分之二十。（六）這一百六十二人之中，男子佔七十七人，婦女佔八十五人。</p>
<p>印度孟買，也有一個「長壽之村」—貝爾加利布—村長是一個一百十歲的老人，村中第十二號屋，共住有一家七十口，平均年齡是九十歲，這家人最高老的是一個老太婆，已經一百二十五歲，曾由樓窗跌落地面，雖受輕傷，不久便已　慈。「長壽村」的名稱，眞是當之無愧。</p>

<h3>Wu and Zhang Separately Visit Special Envoy Zhou Enlai; Date for Five-Person Meeting Still to Be Determined; Marshall Returns to Beijing to Promote Successful Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Guling by This Newspaper, 3rd] Special Envoy Marshall left Guling for Beijing at 8:00 AM on the 3rd. It is rumored that Chairman Chiang visited him on the evening of the 2nd for an hour-long discussion. Special Envoy Marshall is expected to return to Guling this weekend to facilitate a successful five-person meeting.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by This Newspaper, 3rd] Special Envoy Marshall arrived in Nanjing by plane at 11:15 AM on the 3rd and immediately returned to his residence to rest. At 5:00 PM, the Special Envoy visited him at Haining Road for discussions, departing at 6:30 PM.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by This Newspaper, 3rd] Zhou Enlai returned to Nanjing at 1:30 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd. Due to the hot weather and the arduous journey, he did not go out. He instructed Wang Bingnan to visit the US Embassy at 4:00 PM to inform them that he could not visit that day. It is learned that Zhou plans to first meet with Marshal Marshall on the 4th to obtain his views from Guling and will also meet with Ambassador Stuart. The date for the informal group meeting will be determined after the Special Envoy exchanges views with both the Kuomintang and the Communist parties. It is generally hoped that the pre-meeting consultations will be satisfactory so that the meeting can proceed smoothly and achieve some results after a single session.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by This Newspaper, 3rd] Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng went to the US Embassy at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd to exchange views with the Special Envoy before the meeting. Wu gave a detailed explanation and analysis of the discussions since the opening of the Political Consultative Conference. Subsequently, the Special Envoy gave a detailed account of his participation in the negotiations over the past month. Wu and Zhang departed at 11:45 AM. Regarding the two preconditions insisted upon by the Communist Party, Zhang stated that these were military issues and that they were currently seeking a solution through political means. According to another source, if the Communist Party's insistence can be discussed outside the meeting and not be the main topic of the meeting, the government is still willing to negotiate with them patiently.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by This Newspaper, 3rd] Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng visited Zhou Enlai at 5:30 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd for a half-hour discussion. It is reported that the focus of the conversation was an exchange of views. Zhou inquired again about the two preconditions. It is reported that Wu and others did not give a definite answer regarding the ceasefire.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by This Newspaper, 3rd] The date of the informal five-person group meeting, as observed from the situation on the evening of the 3rd, depends on when Zhou Enlai meets with Marshall and Stuart. When Marshall and Stuart suggested to the Chairman to convene this meeting, there were no so-called preconditions. However, Zhou suddenly insisted on the so-called two preconditions, so there will inevitably be some twists and turns.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] It is learned that the informal five-person group will not adopt a formal meeting format but will be in the nature of consultations. There will be no chairman during the consultations, and no fixed format will be followed, hence the name "Informal Five-Person Group Talks." Furthermore, according to a spokesman for the Chinese Communist Party, the Communist Party is still waiting for the government's response to the two points it has raised, and has not yet considered whether to participate in the five-person group.</p>

<h3>Central Government Holds Grand Ceremony; Minister Bai Delivers Earnest Speech; Achievements Must Be Guaranteed by Construction</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] Today is the anniversary of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. The glorious victory achieved by the bloodshed and sacrifice of the military and civilians across the country over the past eight years will forever be a bright page in the history of the Chinese nation. The central government held a commemorative ceremony at the National Government Auditorium at 9:00 AM. The ceremony was simple and grand, presided over by Chairman Zhang Ji. More than 200 central committee members and civil and military officials attended. After the Chairman led the ceremony, Minister Bai Chongxi delivered a speech, elaborating on the significance of the commemoration.</p>
<p>Recalling the Hardships of the War</p>
<p>Minister Bai first stated: Today is the anniversary of the glorious victory of the eight-year Anti-Japanese War. In the past eight years of the sacred Anti-Japanese War, due to the government's firm and correct supreme national policy, as well as political and strategic strategies, and the unity of the military and civilians across the country under the leadership of the supreme leader to sacrifice and fight, and jointly fight with the Allied forces, we were finally able to defeat the Japanese and achieve the final victory. Recalling the beginning of the naval war, our country fought alone with Japan. Because of the weak economic, cultural, and various other conditions, it was extremely difficult. However, the reason why we were still able to resist for a long time was partly due to the self-confidence of our thousands of years of nation and the power of our long-standing culture, and partly due to the inspiration of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three People's Principles. Even if we encountered all kinds of material difficulties, the spiritual aspect was enough to make up for this shortcoming. Later, the Pacific War and the Soviet-Japanese War successively broke out. The Allied countries fought together. Our war against Japan alone changed to a war in which the Allied countries jointly fought against the enemy. Therefore, we were finally able to achieve victory in the Anti-Japanese War, but the fruits of victory must be guaranteed by construction. During the Anti-Japanese War, we often used the slogan that the Anti-Japanese War must be won and the nation must be built. Now, the second step of nation-building must be carried out in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Plan for National Reconstruction, and in accordance with the instructions of the President, we must use construction to guarantee the fruits of victory and begin the great cause of nation-building.</p>
<p>Future Construction Path</p>
<p>Bai then described the path of future construction, focusing on the four major constructions of politics, economy, military, and culture. Regarding political construction, Bai emphasized that the foundation of local autonomy must be established as soon as possible, and said: The National Assembly has been scheduled to convene, and a constitution will be formulated and prepared for implementation, but the constitution must have the foundation of autonomy, so it is necessary to intensify the implementation of the new county system and implement the Three People's Principles. Regarding economic construction, the Chairman has issued an order this year to resolutely implement the two-five rent reduction. If we talk about economic construction, we must at least start by reducing the burden on farmers. Therefore, the measures for the two-five rent reduction should be implemented urgently. As for measures to improve people's lives and increase people's well-being, they cannot be achieved overnight.</p>
<p>Continue Troop Reorganization</p>
<p>Bai said when discussing military construction: The troop reorganization plan will continue to be carried out. The 54th Army south of the Longhai Railway has been reorganized, but unfortunately, the troops north of the Longhai Railway cannot be reorganized due to some reason. As for the officers and soldiers who are surplus to the establishment, resettlement measures have been determined. In addition, for national defense construction, such as the reorganization of the army, the establishment of the air force, and the strengthening of the navy, all should be carried out in accordance with the established policy, so as to complete modern and scientific national defense. Bai then pointed out that cultural construction should focus on universally improving the level of national education, while developing scientific education to enrich national defense forces.</p>
<p>Eliminate Obstacles to Unification</p>
<p>Bai finally emphasized that the country must be unified, political orders should be unified, and military orders should also be unified. Therefore, all forces that hinder unification should be eliminated. This is the responsibility of the government. As for how to eliminate all obstacles and how to overcome all difficulties, it depends on the joint efforts of the people of the whole country. After the speech, the attendees went to Linggu Temple to pay tribute to the martyrs.</p>

<h3>US Allows Sale of Civilian Surplus Materials; Supply Bureau Begins Processing; Zhou Zixin Flies to Okinawa to Prepare for Transportation</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Executive Yuan has decided that the Material Supply Bureau will be responsible for handling the US sale of civilian surplus materials. According to the person in charge of the bureau yesterday, the original value of these materials was over 850 million yuan. This amount should be reduced by depreciation and old debts in legal tender that the United States should compensate our country. The amount of the remaining payment has not been fully stipulated in the contract signed by both parties, but the depreciation method should be planned by the United States.</p>
<p>Zhou Zixin, Deputy Director of the Supply Bureau, was ordered yesterday to fly to Okinawa Island with six engineering experts to establish the Okinawa Island Storage and Reorganization Office, with Zhou concurrently serving as director. Eight more people are scheduled to go today. In the future, if transportation is convenient, about forty to fifty people will be dispatched to the office successively. The materials on Okinawa Island are expected to be cleared by February. As for Guam, Saipan, and other places, staff will be dispatched to set up storage and reorganization offices if transportation is convenient. All transportation of materials will be assisted and responsible by the United States.</p>
<p>After the materials arrive, the bureau will classify them and entrust them to designated agencies for processing. For example, timber will be handed over to the Central Trust Bureau, ships to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, transportation equipment to the Ministry of Communications, raw cotton to the China Textile Construction Company, and vehicles to the United Vehicle Sales Office. In addition, large amounts of materials will be put up for bidding, and some materials will be publicly advertised for auction. Rations, etc., will still be allocated to public school teachers at the lowest price. The bureau is currently planning how to store and place the materials. Generally, except for some necessities that need to be stored in warehouses, because there are not many warehouses, other goods that can be left uncovered will be placed in open spaces. In addition, in order to prevent theft and leakage of materials after arrival, the bureau has specially ordered all employees to prepare uniforms and will send a large number of military police to guard the docks at that time. Only employees of the bureau will be allowed to enter and exit the restricted area.</p>
<p>The Material Supply Bureau also announced that it will establish branch offices in Tianjin, Chongqing, Guangdong, and Nanjing to handle these materials.</p>
<p>New York Times Commentary</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 2nd] The New York Times commented on the US transfer of surplus materials to China, believing that it is a major step in the US accelerating the expansion of China's economy. However, Zhou Enlai believes that this transfer will give the central government the power to attack the Communist forces. Zhou and others believe that this material will give Chairman Chiang at least three years of strength to fight them. It is reported that the Chinese Communists strongly oppose this matter, as this move undoubtedly increases the resources of China's legitimate central government. However, the transferred items do not include aircraft or other weapons. Marshal Ma himself learned of this and expressed his approval. This move shows our true effort, that is, not to incite war, but only to want China to be strong and united so that peace can be realized. At the same time, we obviously cannot do as the Communists demand. We have no intention of withdrawing from China. The newspaper commented on China purchasing these surplus materials for only one-fifth of their cost, saying that the United States should be very satisfied and recognize that this contract is "extremely reasonable" because it allows us to dispose of goods that we would otherwise be unable to sell, allowing us to recover materials dispersed throughout the Pacific, and promoting friendship between us and our allies. At the same time, this move is also extremely beneficial to China's economic recovery, as it can stop China's inflation, and its impact on stimulating industry will be immeasurable.</p>
<h3>Sino-Philippine Civil Aviation Negotiations Establish Only Temporary Agreement; Permanent Agreement to Be Discussed at Length</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] According to a responsible person from the Ministry of Communications who participated in the Sino-Philippine civil aviation negotiations, the Sino-Philippine civil aviation negotiations have come to an end, but only a temporary oral agreement has been reached. The rumor that the two countries have signed a civil aviation contract in the capital is not true. As for a permanent agreement, it still needs to be discussed at length before it can be concluded. It is said that this temporary oral agreement is purely based on the needs of both parties. After its establishment, it will greatly facilitate the return of overseas Chinese to their homeland and the Philippines. After the end of the Pacific War, many overseas Chinese in the Philippines were eager to return to China, and many overseas Chinese stranded in China also yearned to return to the Philippines. At that time, due to factual needs, a temporary agreement was reached with the Philippines that there would be irregular flights between the two countries. However, this was not a long-term solution, so the current temporary oral agreement was established. According to the agreement, aircraft from two Philippine airlines can land in Shanghai twice a week, and aircraft from China National Aviation Corporation can also land in Manila twice a week. In the future, aircraft from Central Air Transport Corporation can also land in the Philippines. This move will not only greatly facilitate overseas Chinese, but also greatly benefit the promotion of trade relations between the two countries.</p>

<h3>Trade Between India and Xinjiang to Resume Soon</h3>

<h3>President Yu Talks About Impressions of Trip to the West; Everything in Xinjiang Shows Progress; Chairman Zhang's Policy of Governing Xinjiang is Very Correct</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 3rd] President Yu received a warm welcome from all parties after arriving in Lanzhou. Due to the insistent requests of local people, he agreed to stay as a guest of honor and will first return to his ancestral home in Sanyuan on the 4th before returning to Nanjing. The reporter visited him today, and Mr. Yu happily received him and spoke freely about his impressions of his trip to the west. According to him, the situation in Xinjiang Province shows considerable progress, and Chairman Zhang Zhizhong's policy of governing Xinjiang is also very correct. The central government's established national policy is to support the high degree of autonomy of the people in the border areas. Chairman Zhang has reorganized the provincial government based on this principle, allowing representatives of all ethnic groups to participate in provincial administration, which has given the border people great excitement. He was particularly moved by the patriotic sentiments of the various ethnic groups he saw during his inspection of southern Xinjiang. The slogan "Long live the Republic of China and the Three Principles of the People" can be heard everywhere. The slogan of building a new Xinjiang based on the Three Principles of the People is especially welcomed by the people everywhere. The living standards and cultural level of the people of Xinjiang Province are not backward. If political stability and popular rest are achieved in the future, Xinjiang's future will surely see extremely rapid and great progress.</p>
<h3>Cheng Qian Talks About Optimistic Overall Situation; Only Requires the People to Jointly Abide by Credibility and Peace</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 2nd] General Headquarters Director Cheng Qian returned to Hankou from Guling on the evening of the 1st. Our reporter visited him at his private residence in the suburbs this afternoon. The reporter asked about his impressions of this trip, and Mr. Cheng calmly replied that the Chairman inherited the legacy of the Premier and engaged in the work of revolutionary nation-building. The fundamental attitude in his handling of affairs is credibility and peace. This is not only the Chairman's personal virtue but also the consistent spirit of our party. The Chairman's communique on August 14 has already fully explained this. He knew that this credibility and peace has become the only current national policy and has gained the understanding and sympathy of Chinese and foreign people. Government policies and guidelines would continue to be based on this spirit. Today it is clear who is working against this path and will eventually be abandoned by the people. When asked about the overall situation, Mr. Cheng replied, "Absolutely optimistic." The overall situation is of course optimistic if everyone values honesty and loves peace. Even if some people continue to ignore honesty in the future, the overall situation will still be optimistic, because honesty and peace will be jointly followed by the majority of people.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Success Comes from Trying!</h3>
<p>The "Five-Person Group" specifically discussing the reorganization of the National Government is said to be starting formal talks in the capital today. During this "all-out martial arts" period of widespread warfare, this unexpected "civilian drama" provides the audience with a clear view. Regardless of its success, negotiation is always better than refusing to negotiate.</p>
<p>However, the mission of this five-person group is viewed differently by everyone. Government representatives state that Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart's original proposal declared that discussions were limited to the number of CCP (Chinese Communist Party) members participating in the reorganized National Government Committee, and nothing else. Not only would military issues not be discussed, but issues regarding various ministries of the Executive Yuan would also not be discussed at this time. Even the number of committee members from parties other than the CCP would not be on the agenda. However, CCP representatives keep insisting on issuing a ceasefire order and demanding that the government retract its request for the Communist army to withdraw from certain industrial areas, as if these are additional conditions for the negotiation. In fact, the views of the two veteran peacekeepers, Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart, are not wrong at all. If the National Government is blessed by heaven and reorganized smoothly, with representatives from various parties and social elites gathered together to calmly discuss politics, then all major military and national plans can be decided by this supreme National Government Committee. Why argue so much at this time? Therefore, if both sides have genuine sincerity in the negotiations starting today, a turning point in the overall national situation is not impossible at this moment.</p>
<p>However, although Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Lisheng, the government representatives returning to Nanjing from Kuling, vigorously stated that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek had encouraged them to do their utmost to make the five-person group a success, CCP representative Zhou Enlai was still enjoying the film "The Light of the Soviet Union" in Shanghai the night before. When he went to Nanjing yesterday morning, he carried a heavy heart and told people that this negotiation was only an attempt, as if he had no confidence at all. Belief breeds strength. Now, the CCP representatives themselves lack confidence in the five-person negotiation. One wonders what sincerity and strength they have. However, we still remember Mr. Hu Shih, who advocated for vernacular Chinese, writing vernacular poems and publishing a "Collection of Attempts" in his early years, reciting a famous revisionist line: "Success comes from trying." Therefore, even though Zhou Enlai said that today's negotiations are just an attempt, if he has the sincere intention to try, the attempt may not be unsuccessful. Wu Tiecheng's statement that even if there are difficulties, success can be achieved as long as there are sincere negotiations is probably the same as our thinking.</p>
<p>As for the allocation of committee seats in the National Government to various parties, we believe that if we truly want to find a solution, it is not an impossible task. As long as the term "veto power," which is unreasonable and illegal, is not used, a solution may be found through negotiation. Because, according to the government organization plan passed by the previous Political Consultative Conference, Article 6 stipulates that general proposals are valid if passed by more than half of the committee members present. However, proposals involving changes to the governing program passed by the Political Consultative Conference are valid if passed by two-thirds of the committee members present. If there is any doubt as to whether a proposal involves a change to the governing program, its interpretation is still determined by more than half of the committee members present. We believe that since the Kuomintang is sincere in implementing the governing program decided by the Political Consultative Conference, it can be seen that it does not intend to make any changes. In that case, it does not really matter if the CCP has one or two more seats. As long as the Kuomintang committee members are self-respecting, attend every meeting, and maintain a consistent attitude, without inconsistency or even opposition, can a fair proposal not be passed by more than half of the votes? Therefore, we want to say this: what the Kuomintang should strive for is policy, what the Kuomintang should seek is talent, and what the Kuomintang should restrain is its own committee members. If the Kuomintang does not look inward but only argues about the number and proportion of seats of other parties, that is truly a dead end. We hope that the CCP does not get stuck in the "veto power" dead end, and the Kuomintang does not get stuck in the dead end of restricting the number of CCP seats to eight. If both sides are sincere, this negotiation can progress from legal procedures to success.</p>
<p>Starting from the Greek Referendum</p>
<p>Greece held a referendum on the 1st of this month to decide on the country's political system. Ballot counts across various regions are showing that, on average, 75% of the populace favors the return of King George II to restore the monarchy. On the day the referendum was held, competition between the left and right wings was intense. However, under the supervision of British and American observers, no accidents occurred, and voters were able to freely vote according to their own will, without any pressure. The result of this referendum can be seen as an expression of Greek public opinion, enough to clarify the chaotic Greek political situation.</p>
<p>After the war, the Balkan Peninsula has almost become the territory of the Slavic people, with Greece being the only remaining exception. Therefore, Greece has become a battleground for competition between Britain and the Soviet Union. In addition, Greece has territorial disputes with Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia, making it a thorn in the side of the Slavic countries. In order to consolidate its position, the Greek authorities had to request that British troops remain in the country to maintain domestic order. The Soviet Union has repeatedly criticized the British troops' presence in Greece in the United Nations Security Council, arguing that it is disrupting the Balkan situation and threatening world peace. This time, the Ukrainian representative Manuilsky accused Greece at the Security Council, also saying that the British troops' presence in Greece interfered with the country's internal affairs, enough to endanger peace.</p>
<p>It is indeed not easy for Greece to cope with the changes in the situation in the gap between the contradictions between Britain and the Soviet Union. However, Prime Minister Tsaldaris has stood firm and has never retreated a step in the face of the diplomatic offensives of the Slavic countries. For example, in the Paris Peace Conference, the representatives of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria often targeted Greece and launched fierce attacks. In the New York Security Council, the Ukrainian representative made anti-Greek remarks, claiming that Greece provoked Albania, causing border conflicts, or that Greece attempted to change the borders of the Balkan Peninsula. However, the Greek government has always been firm and unyielding.</p>
<p>Since Greece has become a target of public criticism in the international arena and is being bullied and humiliated everywhere, it is natural to arouse the patriotism of the people and make them more inclined towards Britain. The victory of the right wing in this referendum was unexpected, but it is also a natural result of the recent evolution of the international situation. Parisian newspapers call it a case of the Slavic group shooting itself in the foot, which implies a profound meaning.</p>
<p>Before the war, Britain's power in Southeastern Europe was originally deeply rooted and unshakable. However, after the Great War, the situation in the Balkans changed, becoming the world of the Slavic people, and Britain's power has been declining. In addition, the Soviet Union has great ambitions for the Turkish Straits issue. Since the end of the war, the Soviet Union has repeatedly asked Turkey to jointly defend the Straits, putting Britain's position in the Near East under a serious threat. In addition, there is the Iranian issue in the Middle East, as well as the Palestinian issue, which makes Britain feel "headache" everywhere. Therefore, in order to maintain its imperial status, Britain has to hold on to Greece and refuse to let go, not allowing it to fall into the embrace of the Slavic ethnic group, but wanting to keep it as a springboard for Britain to develop towards Southeastern Europe. King George II of Greece is currently in London, and Prime Minister Tsaldaris will also travel from Paris to report the results of the referendum and ask him to return to the country as soon as possible to restore the monarchy. From then on, the relationship between Britain and Greece will inevitably become closer, and the conflict between Britain and the Soviet Union may become more acute.</p>
<p>Greek politics has always been known for its democracy. Although it still maintains the form of a monarchy, in essence, it is similar to British politics, and no one can call it an anti-democratic political system. As for the domestic situation, there is a division between the left and right wings. In addition to differing opinions on internal affairs, their diplomatic views are also diametrically opposed. In fact, this is the case in any country today. Taking Britain as an example, the British Communist Party is also there opposing the United States and opposing the Labour Cabinet's foreign policy of assisting Greece. Therefore, we must not divide the left and right wings in Greece by democracy versus anti-democracy. The reason why the Soviet Union opposes Greece holding a referendum and opposes the current Greek government continuing to govern is not so much because the Greek government is undemocratic, but rather because the Tsaldaris cabinet's foreign policy is close to Britain and inconsistent with the interests of the Soviet Union. "One leaf falls and the world knows autumn." The result of this vote in Greece will inevitably increase the tension of the confrontation between the two major forces in Southeastern Europe.</p>

<p>Letter of Correction</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Regarding the report published in your newspaper on August 25th stating that the Tianjin Social Affairs Bureau privately hoarded over 2,000 catties of grain during the winter relief efforts last year, which had completely rotted, and that the investigation team sent personnel to investigate, suspecting abuse of power for personal gain, after investigation, the aforementioned grain was leftover from the Tianjin winter relief efforts and was allocated from the old millet and grain in the Japanese puppet warehouse, not wheat. As for the city's handling of millet and grain distribution for winter relief last year, local charitable organizations were responsible for handling it by district. After the conclusion, the remaining grain from the Qiande Zhuang Congee Factory was entrusted to the original organizers, the Huang Society and the Cihui Pujitongshen Society, for safekeeping. The two societies, due to the limited space at their headquarters, stored it in the cellar of the adjacent No. 51 Elementary School, which was reported to the municipal government. On May 28th, it was requested in document No. 542 from the society to the municipal government for approval to sell it by bidding. Approval was subsequently received to temporarily suspend the sale and keep it for this year's winter relief. However, due to several heavy rains in Tianjin in recent months, water entered the cellar, and the stored grain could no longer be kept. A request was resubmitted to the municipal government in early July, approving the delivery of the winter surplus grain to the Doudian Industry Association for transportation and sale. Furthermore, the bureau's handling of the amount and method of disposal of the remaining grain from last year's winter relief efforts were reported to the Ministry of Social Affairs and the municipal government at any time, and there was no private hoarding or anything like that. Accordingly, this letter is hereby sent, respectfully requesting verification and correction. Tianjin Municipal Government Social Affairs Bureau, September 1st</p>

<h3>US Fleet Sails Towards Aegean Sea, British Mediterranean Fleet Heads East</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Naples, Italy, 3rd] The American naval fleet has completed its visit here and sailed to Piraeus, Greece, this morning.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 2nd] The British Admiralty announced today that the British Mediterranean Fleet is scheduled to patrol the Greek waters from the 18th of this month for six weeks. This announcement carries a particularly profound meaning, as the US Naval Task Force, led by the latest aircraft carrier "Roosevelt," will also be leaving the Mediterranean as the British fleet departs from Malta heading east. The Roosevelt and its escort ships are now in Italian waters and are scheduled to sail to the Aegean Sea in Greece in the coming days, then to Malta, Algiers, Tangier, and Casablanca, and possibly make its first visit to the Dardanelles in Turkey. The British Admiralty reported that "The Mediterranean Fleet, commanded by Commander-in-Chief Willis, will sail with the flagship "Liverpool" to the Eastern Mediterranean, scheduled to depart from Malta on September 18th and return to its base in early November. The fleet will visit the Southern Aegean Sea, Crete, and Cyprus." It is noted that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, in his speech at the Paris Peace Conference last week, accused the United States of sending warships into the Greek waters and interfering in Greece's internal affairs, and Soviet newspapers have repeatedly criticized it.</p>
<h3>Britain and Yugoslavia Make Huge Compensation Demands to Italy, Molotov May Return to Paris This Week</h3>
<p>[Consolidated News from this Newspaper] According to Reuters Paris, sources close to the Peace Conference say that after Molotov returns to Paris from the Soviet Union, the Four Powers meeting can be convened. Molotov may return to France this week. If he still hasn't arrived by then, then it should depend on the progress of the Four Powers Deputy Foreign Ministers' talks to decide whether to convene the Foreign Ministers' meeting during Molotov's absence. It is reported that after long discussions, the Four Powers Deputy Foreign Ministers have agreed on some amendments to the peace treaty. However, the purpose of convening the Four Powers Foreign Ministers' meeting is not only to discuss the peace conference amendments. For example, the United Nations General Assembly, originally scheduled to be held on September 23rd, should be postponed or not is also in urgent need of discussion and decision by the Four Powers Foreign Ministers.</p>
<p>Paris broadcast on the 3rd: The Italian Economic Committee met this afternoon to begin the lottery to determine the order of appearance of the twelve countries that have requested compensation at the meeting. The determined order is as follows: (Countries attending in order from Thursday) Greece, Albania, Poland, Yugoslavia, Belgium, Brazil, Britain, Abyssinia, Netherlands, Norway, France, Egypt. Immediately afterwards, the examination of Article 64 of the Peace Treaty concerning Italian compensation continued.</p>
<p>According to Agence France-Presse Paris, Italian Prime Minister Gasperi flew to Paris from Milan on the 3rd.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency Paris on the 2nd, Britain's demand for Italy to pay 11 billion US dollars in compensation to the United Kingdom and British colonies at the Peace Conference shocked the Italian delegation and surprised other delegations. This astonishing figure is equal to 110 times the amount requested by the Soviet Union. Other countries that have made compensation requests to Italy include Egypt at 50 million, Belgium at 62 million, and Poland at 10 million. The total amount of compensation claims currently made to Italy by ten Allied countries, including the Soviet Union, has reached 18 billion yuan.</p>

<h3>Romanian Representative Argues Against Ceding Territory to Hungary</h3>
<p>At the joint meeting of the Hungarian-Romanian Territory and Politics Committee on the 2nd, Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu attended and expressed his views. Regarding the committee's proposal to cede 4,000 square kilometers of land in Outer Transylvania to Hungary, he expressed his disagreement, stating that such a concession to Hungary violates international morality and constitutes a historical error.</p>
<p>Outer Transylvania is historically, economically, and ethnically a part of the Romanian territory. There is also no reason for Romania to demand autonomy for the Hungarian minorities, as all ethnic groups in Hungary enjoy freedom of speech, religion, and culture.</p>

We are not only concerned about but also responsible for the future of mankind, and we must cooperate together. I am very pleased to have contributed to the drafting of the recently signed Sino-French agreement, which is the initial result of producing favorable cooperation. We can, based on the great principles revealed by the French Revolution and the principles of the United Nations Charter that Mr. Sun Yat-sen had already elucidated, work together to achieve the ideal of human progress." Wang praised the activities of the Sino-French Association, which was established after the liberation of Paris, emphasizing the importance of cultural cooperation and mutual understanding between the two countries.</p>
<h3>Continued Testimony at the International Tribunal: Japanese Atrocities and Poisoning of China</h3>
<p>The Number of Drug Addicts in the Puppet State of Manchuria Reaches Ten Million</p>
<p>[Reconstruction Society, Tokyo, 3rd] Today, the International Tribunal prosecutor presented eight statements regarding atrocities committed by several Japanese soldiers in Wuyuan County, Suiyuan Province, in 1940, and two statements regarding looting and arson in the same county. Following this, three charts prepared by the Ministry of Justice of our country were submitted, indicating the classification and number of Japanese military crimes. The presentation of evidence related to Japanese military atrocities has now been completed. Subsequently, various documents related to Japan's poisoning of China were presented. The Director-General of the "Asia Development Board," Kawai, testified, stating that the board was the agency in China that distributed opium.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd] The prosecution at the International Tribunal presented approximately ten photographic files from the U.S. Treasury Department, proving that Japan protected the trafficking of opium and narcotics in the occupied areas of China and encouraged opium cultivation. One document stated that Japanese and Koreans used brothels as drug trafficking organizations. Pawnshops were also involved in this business, and pitiful drug addicts pawned their clothes to obtain drugs. According to investigations in the four northeastern provinces, one-third of the people were drug users, and the money spent on drugs each year reached 80 million yuan. Japanese selling of drugs resulted in profits six times over.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 3rd] The evidence presented by the International Tribunal this morning revealed that because the puppet Manchukuo government relied on opium as its primary source of tax revenue, it encouraged opium smoking. As a result, nearly one-third of the 30 million people in puppet Manchukuo were addicts. Every day, several people collapsed in the streets due to withdrawal symptoms, and their clothes were stripped off by other addicts.</p>

<h3>Indian Government Chairman Nehru Announces Major Policies: India to be Governed by Indians; Ten-Year Plan to Improve People's Livelihood</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper's combined sources] According to United Press, New Delhi, Congress Party President Nehru was sworn in today as Chairman of the Interim Government of India. He received reporters and stated that he would serve the Indian people and implement a ten-year plan to improve people's livelihood. He further stated that the Interim Government of India had three other policies to mention: (1) We shall discuss all matters in a responsible cabinet system, make decisions together, and be jointly responsible. (2) Foreign residents within India are only temporary residents. We welcome them as ordinary residents, but in official positions, they must withdraw. From now on, India will be governed by Indians themselves for the welfare of the Indian people. (3) Freedom is our highest goal, but we must face pressing issues such as clothing, food, housing, education, and hygiene. Finally, Nehru appealed to the Indian people not to conflict with each other but to cooperate. According to Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, after the establishment of the Interim Government of India was announced, Muslims in various places held demonstrations, all wearing black紗 on their arms, divided into large and small teams, parading through the streets, moving toward the government and the Governor's residence. Although the government had ordered a ban on public gatherings, the police did not interfere. The Muslims then climbed telephone poles in the evening and hung black fire flags to express their mourning, a desolate scene. However, the government authorities and members of the Congress Party were unmoved. Muslims and Hindus walking on the streets did not cause disturbances. The police seemed to have received instructions to take action only when riots occurred.</p>
<p>According to United Press, early in the morning of the 3rd in Bombay, Indian Muslims again caused disturbances. To date, the known number of deaths has increased to 72. Although the riots were quite intense, they were short-lived and ended after the police opened fire. The general situation in Bombay seems less tense than on Monday. Therefore, the hope that the city will return to normal is stronger.</p>
<h3>Gandhi's Sorrowful Words: Admonishing Both Factions to Cease Fighting</h3>
<p>[According to United Press, New Delhi] Gandhi stated at a prayer meeting on the 3rd, "The Congress Party must not collude with the British to deal with Muslims. In any case, if Indian Muslims must fight, then let them go forward bravely and decide the outcome themselves. If we continue to rely on British weapons, India will not truly be free. All ministers of the new government must disregard life and death and seek reconciliation between the two religions." Gandhi also stated regarding military assistance to the new government that the new government aims to win freedom for India, including Muslims. If Muslims resolutely regard the new government personnel as enemies, then the government must "prove the inaccuracy of this belief with accurate measures."</p>
<h3>Egyptian Cabinet to be Reorganized</h3>

<h3>French Woman Gives Birth to Quadruplets: Mother and Babies All Doing Well</h3>

<h3>Pacific Peace Conference: U.S. Actively Preparing; Japan May Become the Tip of the Spear of Ideological Conflict; Drafting the Treaty with Japan Should be Done with Caution</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 2nd] The U.S. government is currently working hard to prepare for an international conference to draft a Pacific peace treaty, but most of the details, such as when it will be convened and which countries will participate, have not yet been decided. It is also unknown what kind of treaty will be drafted for Japan. It has been a year since the Allied occupation of Japan, and the success of the occupation will determine the nature of the treaty. To date, the occupation has been in good faith, and this can be seen in the fairness of the U.S. attitude in the directives issued by MacArthur's headquarters to the Japanese government. It has previously been stated that the treaty with Japan will not be of a vengeful nature, and it is expected that the victorious countries drafting the treaty will adopt an attitude that allows it to survive. According to senior officials concerned with peace in the Pacific, the State Department and MacArthur are actively preparing to convene the conference. Whether sooner or later, the U.S. will participate in the conference with a carefully prepared, broad plan, using this as the basic condition for peace in Japan and the Pacific region.</p>
<p>Five-Year Term for Overseeing Japanese Civil Administration</p>
<p>According to authoritative sources, under future plans, the U.S. military occupation will last for three to five years, followed by civil administration supervised by the Allied forces for 25 years. By then, the Japanese people's government will have been fully reformed, and in accordance with the aims and principles outlined by the Allied powers in the Potsdam Declaration, Japan will become a member of the international community, accepting and upholding sound democratic principles. It is believed here that the tension caused by the opposition of political ideals makes the Allied measures in Japan even more important. Japan is located in a crucial area and has become a front line for democratic countries. The current Japanese Empire could become the tip of the spear of conflicting ideologies or even the flashpoint for a future world war. The directives issued by MacArthur will largely determine the way Japan is governed in the future, as well as its living standards and social conditions.</p>
<p>Difficulties in Adjusting Strategic Issues</p>
<p>However, strategic issues concerning Japan must be considered when drafting the treaty, and their resolution may inevitably encounter difficulties. The Allied powers may not easily reach agreement on land, sea, and air force issues. Countries with significant interests in Japan and the East must be adjusted in the treaty to avoid conflict with each other. As for who will draft the terms of the treaty, it is still undecided at this time. The Far Eastern Commission may be responsible for convening the conference. It is also undecided whether countries not on the Far Eastern Commission can participate in the conference. The commission is not currently concerned with the terms of the treaty; its primary concern is the Japanese constitution. The commission has not actually passed the constitution, but it wants to ensure that it complies with the Potsdam Declaration. The commission is also studying the Japanese tax system and is expected to make an announcement within days. The statement intends to determine that foreigners residing in Japan will only pay the same taxes as Japanese people in the future, so as to avoid discrimination. Washington officials are quite optimistic about the overall situation in the Pacific and believe that although there may be differences of opinion among the countries concerned, a peaceful resolution will be achieved, leading the countries of the world toward universal peace.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Foresight: His Son Writes About His Father's Views</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 2nd] The American magazine "Look" today published a section from the book "As He Saw It" by the late President Roosevelt's son, Elliott, which stated: After the Casablanca Conference in January 1943, my (Elliott's self-description) father said that Americans were dying in the Pacific because of the short-sightedness of Britain, France, and the Netherlands. Unless the colonial system is abolished, the world will still face a third war. After this war, if we still leave hundreds of millions of people in a state of semi-slavery, the consequences are unimaginable. Elliott further stated: Churchill always thought that we should enter Central Europe and meet the Red Army, so that the British sphere of influence could be expanded as far east as possible. After meeting Churchill, Mountbatten, and other leaders, my father told me that Britain wanted to recover Burma for its colonial empire. Burma could affect Vietnam, India, and Indonesia. If one of these countries gains freedom, the others will follow suit. De Gaulle also disregarded the disappearance of other colonial powers. In India, Java, Burma, Vietnam, and other places, only goods are shipped out, and no compensation is shipped in. This is a distant cause of another war. If we win the war, the four powers will be responsible for peace, carrying out tasks such as development, education, and raising living standards. When backward areas have matured, they should be allowed to become independent. My father made it clear to Churchill that America's participation in the war was not to help Britain and others maintain the imperial ideas of the Middle Ages.</p>

<h3>Committee Members of the Investigation Team Personally Visit Mayor Wu to Request Three Case Files to Investigate Major Corruption Cases; The Informant is a Former Senior Official of the City Government</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In the corruption case involving 4 billion yuan worth of materials from the Municipal Government Receiving Materials Management Office, which was reported, Zhang Qingzhen, a member of the investigation team, personally visited Mayor Wu to conduct an investigation. A reporter visited Mayor Wu at 6 PM yesterday to inquire about the details of the case. According to Mayor Wu, during Mayor Qian's tenure, following the instructions of the Chairman, he did a lot of welfare work. He originally intended to allocate materials to the city's public school teachers and staff, but because it was inconvenient to distribute physical objects, he changed to issuing rice loans of 20,000 yuan per person per month. The funds were derived from the proceeds of the bidding for the materials received from the pseudo-Central Market, totaling more than 3.1 billion yuan. Mayor Wu said that after taking office, because he felt that the police and street sweepers were poorly treated, the rice loans could not be canceled for the time being, but the funds were not available, so he continued to bid for the materials. However, all bidding during his tenure was attended by the Audit Department, totaling 1.12 billion yuan. In addition to allocating 50 million yuan to the Consumer Cooperative Fund, the rest was used for rice loans. At 7 PM, Committee Member Zhang Qingzhen visited Mayor Wu and told this newspaper's reporter that Mayor Wu's explanation of the case was very detailed. As for the 3.1 billion yuan obtained from the bidding during Mayor Qian's tenure, 200 million yuan was allocated to the Youth League's expenses, and the rest is unknown. Mayor Wu also submitted three city government files to Committee Member Zhang for review, including one for the Agricultural Products Market, one for the Xingye Trust Company, and one for the Shanghai Municipal Government's receipt of the pseudo-Central Market file. Committee Member Zhang attached great importance to this case and decided to request the entire list of materials received from the pseudo-Central Market from the Municipal Government Receiving Materials Management Office this morning as a basis for investigation. However, Committee Member Zhang does not intend to express his opinion before the investigation is completed. It is reported that the informant is a former senior official of the Municipal Government, reporting that the former Receiving Materials Management Office colluded with businessmen to illegally bid for materials, arbitrarily distributed the proceeds, and said that the evidence of operating for personal gain and corruption is conclusive.</p>
<h3>The Investigation Team Believes that the Case of the China Textile Company is Not Over</h3>
<p>The Central Receiving Work Investigation Team received a confidential report accusing the China Textile Company of corruption. The team sent officer Zhang Quan to investigate, but did not obtain concrete evidence and believed that the allegations in the original confidential report were not accurate. It had published an investigation report. Yesterday, the reporter asked Committee Member Zhang Qingzhen whether the case would be concluded. He said that after Officer Zhang investigated the case, it still needs to be reviewed by the committee members, so it has not been concluded as of now.</p>
<h3>Japanese War Criminals: Tanaka Hisaichi and Fukuchi Harunami Sentenced to Death by Hanging by the U.S. Military Tribunal; The Remaining Three Criminals Sentenced to Prison; Asakawa Hiroko Acquitted; The Two Devils in Zhejiang Have Been Publicly Prosecuted by Our Side</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In the case of U.S. Fourteenth Air Force pilot Major Hawke, who was killed by the Japanese army after his plane crashed in Hong Kong in January 1945, after half a month of continuous court hearings, interrogation, and debate by the U.S. Military Tribunal here, a verdict was announced yesterday morning: Lieutenant General Tanaka Hisaichi was sentenced to death by hanging, Major General Fukuchi Harunami was sentenced to death by hanging, Lieutenant Colonel Kubo Higai was sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labor, Captain Yamaguchi Kyoichi was sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labor, Major Watanabe Masamori was sentenced to hard labor and imprisonment for 50 years, and Captain Asakawa Hiroko was acquitted and released after being sent back to Japan.</p>
<p>The verdict stated that the trial of Hawke by the Japanese military court that day was illegal and unfair and violated the laws of war. Tanaka Hisaichi, as the Governor of Hong Kong, failed to prevent this unfair judgment and should be held responsible. Fukuchi Harunami was the commanding officer responsible for actually ordering the trial and execution. Kubo Higai was the presiding judge in the court at the time. Yamaguchi Kyoichi and Watanabe Masamori were both jurors. Because Yamaguchi was a member of the 23rd Army Military Law Office, he should have been aware of the law, but he still gave Hawke an unfair judgment, so his crime was more serious than Watanabe's. As for Asakawa Hiroko, she was assigned by Saboru Shii, the head of the judiciary of the former Japanese government in Hong Kong, who had committed suicide out of fear of guilt, and was innocently implicated, so she was acquitted. This verdict can be executed after approval by the U.S. military headquarters. Yesterday, when the criminals heard the verdict, except for Asakawa Hiroko, who was overjoyed and bowed frequently to the court, the other five criminals, including Tanaka Hisaichi, all had pale faces and did not say a word. They were escorted out of the court by military police.</p>

<p>Representatives of the Allied Nations Receive Flags at the Assembly (Photo by This Newspaper)</p>
<p>The Entire Shanghai Market Celebrates the Anniversary of the Allied Victory; National Generals and Envoys Participate in the Assembly; The Mayor Delivers a Speech Elaborating on the Two Factors of Victory</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday was the anniversary of the Allied Victory. The various sectors of this city held a celebration assembly at the Majestic Theatre at 9 AM. The party, government, and military leaders of this city served as the presidium. Allied diplomatic envoys, generals, and representatives of national troops and various organizations and groups, totaling about 1,000 people, attended. Before 9 AM, Mayor Wu had arrived first. Those who arrived later included Pan Gongzhan, Du Yuesheng, Xu Jiluo, Xuan Tiewu, and the consuls of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in Shanghai, Davis, Ogden, Bayern, and Enerliv, and Allied generals Lieutenant General Gillon, Rear Admiral Duer, and Rear Admiral Aiki. In the center of the auditorium hung a portrait of the Prime Minister and the party-state flag. Below hung a specially made victory emblem, and on both sides were arranged 46 Allied national flags. Various potted flowers were placed in front of the stage.</p>
<p>The assembly began in a solemn and respectful atmosphere. Led by Mayor Wu, the attendees performed the rituals. After a minute of silence for the national and Allied soldiers who died in battle, he gave a speech, saying: Everyone present must have many thoughts today. I also have two thoughts: First, China was able to achieve victory thanks to the leader of the War of Resistance, Chairman Chiang, because we had such an indomitable leader who insisted on fighting the war to the end and finally won victory. Second, it should be attributed to the assistance of the Allied nations. On the anniversary of the victory, looking back, the domestic ideals of nation-building have not yet been achieved, and there are still many misunderstandings internationally. However, we have confidence that the domestic and international prospects are bright. Under the wise and outstanding leadership of Generalissimo, there will be a peaceful nation-building plan. Internationally, based on the past spirit of joint operations of the Allied nations, we will still be able to cooperate. Looking forward to the future, we have infinite hope and firm confidence.</p>
<h3>Pan Gongzhan Recalls the Anti-Japanese Spirit of the Citizens</h3>
<p>Speaker Pan Gongzhan then delivered a speech, saying that the 3 million citizens of Shanghai followed the Supreme Commander to participate in the War of Resistance from the beginning, firmly believing that the Supreme Leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, was the most faithful executor of the Prime Minister's teachings. The Prime Minister said that in order to achieve China's freedom and equality, we must awaken the people and unite the world to treat our nation equally and struggle together. Chairman Chiang faithfully executed these two points without error and achieved a great victory. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, Shanghai was originally an unprepared city. The citizens of Shanghai fought the enemy with flesh and blood. The citizens of Shanghai did this to call on the people of the country and the world to participate in the anti-fascist war. The citizens of Shanghai, even during the occupation period, were always thinking of the central government (audience applause). In the future, we hope that the citizens of Shanghai will continue to build a peaceful and democratic country with the spirit of participating in the War of Resistance (applause).</p>
<p>Then, Chen Baohua, the secretary-general of the Municipal Party Department, delivered a speech, first detailing the origins of the victory of the War of Resistance, saying that the work of nation-building, it cannot be denied, has not yet reached the ideal stage, and we especially need to work together. Du Yuesheng also gave a generous speech yesterday. Du emphasized that although the victory has been one year, the comparison between today last year and today this year is very different. Last year today, the violent enemy had just surrendered, and there was jubilation and excitement throughout the country. But today this year, there is a lack of unity in political and military orders, transportation is destroyed, and there is economic panic. At present, we really need peace. Who is destroying peace today? Xu Jiluo also expressed his feelings on the first anniversary of the victory on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce, hoping to work together to make nation-building the first priority.</p>
<h3>General Gillon's Address: Striving for Lasting Peace</h3>
<p>Finally, U.S. Army Lieutenant General Gillon, representing all Allied representatives, spoke, saying that the Allies initially concentrated their forces against Germany because the Allies' supreme strategy required the destruction of the German sea, land, and air forces. Only by destroying Germany's sea and air forces could materials be transported to this side of the Pacific. He then analyzed Hitler's strategic mistakes, and said that in the Allied operations, the cooperation of China had always been valued. Under the leadership of its wise leader, the Chinese people went through the darkest period and achieved victory. Because of the cooperation of the Allies, our descendants will have a bright future, and we can stand under the beautiful flag of the United Nations to celebrate victory. Never in human history has there been such great unity. We have a sacred mission, which is to eliminate violence from the world. Now that we have won, we need lasting peace to repay the millions of United Nations soldiers who sacrificed their precious lives. We must do our best to ensure that the sacrifices were not in vain. We need tolerance and trust, and all countries working together, researching, trading, and living in peace. Cruel wars are by no means a tool for civilized nations to resolve disputes. We want to build lasting world peace.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong and Guangdong Rushing to Print National Standard Textbooks, Strict Orders for Newly Printed and Old Books</h3>
<p>[Guangzhou News] The Guangzhou District Supply Committee of National Standard Textbooks had earlier this autumn handed over the paper plates to the Commercial Press and Zhonghua Book Company in Hong Kong for printing. However, the delivery of goods was slow, or even stopped midway, so there was a severe shortage of national standard books in the market.

<h3>New Cotton Textile Construction Policy Becomes Clear, Yesterday's Cloth Posting Price Has Increased, Double Horse Intends to Reduce to 1.35 Million</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, the opening price of cotton textile construction was 53,000 yuan for 20 count warp and weft 12 pound unbranded fine cloth, 72,000 yuan for Four Gentlemen Nafuto Big Red, and 69,000 yuan for Jumping Carp Yuan Straight Silk Satin. Before the exchange rate change, the Five Blessings fine cloth of 23 count and 22 count New Zealand weave was only 53,000 yuan, while Nafuto Big Red was 68,000 yuan. The increase in the opening price shows that the market is becoming more clear. This strategy was brewed a few days after the exchange rate change. The method is to hang the price of the original genuine brand on the second-rate goods and sell them at prices close to the black market. However, before the private cotton mill's allocation of yarn is controlled, they still dare not openly raise prices significantly. Now that the yarn market has been centrally managed, the opening price has been reduced from 1.4 million to 1.38 million. Our newspaper had predicted the price increase of cotton textile construction in the last issue, so it is not surprising. Before the cotton textile construction was posted yesterday, the cloth price on the market had already dropped by 1,000 or 2,000 yuan. When the posted price was seen to rise, the market immediately fluctuated. Fortunately, there was not much real money before the holiday, and the money market was very tight, so the increase should still be limited. In terms of the price sold by cotton textile construction yesterday, those who do black market still have a slight profit. So, the increase in the posted price does not seem to be able to stimulate the market. What is regrettable is that the root of the cloth is too tight, and people's hearts are inevitably upward. The fact that the delivery location of the 12-pound unbranded fine cloth opened yesterday is far away in Wusong Yuncaobang, but those who requested to purchase it still rushed forward, which can be taken as clear evidence. Four Gentlemen Zhun  is a popular  commodity, and it was also suspended yesterday, which is bound to cause price increases in the colored cloth market. The control of the cotton textile construction over the yarn opening of private cotton mills is being rectified. According to well-informed sources, there is a possibility that the Double Horse standard will be reduced to 1.35 million. Some yarn mills transfer their yarn to self-weaving cloth, and they are not happy to accept yarn distribution orders in attitude. However, selling yarn is ultimately more profitable than selling cloth, so the root of the cloth is difficult to loosen. Observers with status also pointed out that cotton textile construction is working hard to lower the black market and raise the Ming market, but it is feared that the Ming market's price increase will inevitably stimulate the black market due to supply and demand.</p>
<p>Yesterday, yarn and cloth turned sharply downward. The sailing schedule to South China is uncertain, so the Cantonese gang is watching and waiting, and there is no rush to enter. The Xiang, Han, Tianjin, and Beijing gangs also have little appetite. The colleagues all have the intention of selling goods to make money, so they tend to sell. Therefore, Double Horse re-entered the 1.6 million mark and finally closed at 1.556 million. People's hearts turned pale, and the trend is still fragile. Statistics show that miscellaneous 20 count fell 350,000, Double Horse fell 890,000, and 42 count fell a huge 120,000.</p>
<h3>Gold and Paper Money Rise, Market Situation Very Firm</h3>
<p>Hanchi had a reaction yesterday, and the money market eased slightly near noon, so the buying momentum was strong, but the Central Bank was still controlling the market. It opened at 2.02 million in the morning and was sold. People's hearts were afraid of pressure and constrained by the money market. It fell to 2.003 million before it became fixed and rose slightly. After 10 am, the Central Bank allocated 127 items at a price of 2.02 million. After that, it gradually changed from peaceful to stable. After 11 am, the money market eased, and buyers were active, and there was a lot of re-transfer. The market rose to 2.058 million. The Central Bank adjusted from time to time and continued to sell vigorously. After the high, it fell back to 2.04 million. At noon, it stood at 2.045 million. In the afternoon, the next-day delivery was pushed up to 2.06 million, but it was still suppressed. As a result, it rose 24,000 compared to the previous closing. The decoration gold rose 18,000, and the silver bullion and silver dollars were flat. The dark discount loosened, but it was still faint. The dark interest ranged from one corner six to two corners one.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies also rebounded after fatigue. The US dollar opened at 3,240 yuan in the morning and was bought. This price once struggled slightly upward. It did not start to rise until after 10 am. The short sellers were in droves, approaching the 3,300 yuan mark near noon. It settled slightly at noon. It was initially firm and then settled in the afternoon. As a result, it rose 60 yuan compared to the previous closing. The Hong Kong dollar was initially reported to be as low as 660 yuan in Guangzhou and was still around 670 yuan. Later, it followed the progress of gold and paper money to over 700 yuan. As a result, it rose 25 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 690 yuan to 700 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 840 yuan to 850 yuan, the British exchange rate was 11,000 yuan to 11,500 yuan, and there was not much demand for the US exchange rate.</p>
<h3>Buying on Dips, Government Bonds Stable in Black Market, Various Rumors in the Market, Authorities Consider Nonsense</h3>
<p>Large government bond holders came and went differently, but people's hearts were still stable. It was easy to pull up after the dip. The overall C was initially sold off heavily by a large household to a counterparty Lin, shrinking repeatedly from 2,400 yuan. It did not stop falling until it retreated to the 2,000 yuan mark. After a short period of hesitation, two major households on the fifth and seventh floors moved together and gradually rebounded. In the middle, it rose to 2,800 yuan. At the close, it still fell back to around 2,650 yuan. As a result, it rose 170 yuan compared to the previous closing. A and B rose 100 yuan, and D and E rose 50 yuan each.</p>
<p>[Nanjing, 2nd] Recently, the black market for government bonds in Shanghai has fluctuated again. The reporter specially visited the person in charge of the Monetary Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance. According to him, the government has not considered changing the government bond repayment method. The various rumors in Shanghai are all rumors from speculators. Legitimate merchants should not catch shadows and make trouble for themselves.</p>
<h3>Woolen Cloth Pricing Reports Rise</h3>
<p>Recently, the wholesale price of woolen cloth in this city has been unstable due to high-interest loans. Except for large-scale and five- or six-year-old stores, all are turbulent. Both domestic and foreign companies are selling goods. If there is a reliable recipient, they are happy to accept half-month or one-month term checks. Looking at the future, although the customer gang and the local street continue to purchase, their appetite is far weaker than in the past. Due to the continuous arrival of goods, buyers are delaying purchases and hoping for a decline. However, for orders from foreign firms, merchants from the United States and the United Kingdom have received telegrams from abroad stating that prices will all increase from this month, and each yard will increase by 2 cents to 5 cents compared to the previous price. Irregular small businesses even want to add additional orders to those who have already received fixed orders. It can also be seen that the business of doing woolen cloth business is difficult these days.</p>
<h3>Manufacturers Purchase Production Raw Materials, Bank of Communications Can Provide Loans</h3>
<p>Since the Bank of Communications has been organizing loans for public and private enterprises and institutions to purchase production raw materials, manufacturers have called it useful and there have been many who have gone to negotiate and request loans. According to the reporter, the main points of the loan application method are as follows. When public and private enterprises and institutions apply to the Bank of Communications for loans to purchase and transport production raw materials, they should first fill out a true application form. After the Bank of Communications approves it, they will sign a formal contract and calculate interest from the date of the loan. The amount of interest is negotiated by both parties in advance, and the interest rate is mostly around five percent.</p>

<h3>Sugar Price Review Council Decides on Wholesale and Retail Prices; Taiwan Sugar Corporation Will Distribute as Much as Possible; China Sand at 140,000 Yuan Per Dan</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the Social Affairs Bureau and Taiwan Sugar Corporation jointly arranged for the distribution of sugar in the city, the distribution price has gradually been reduced to 70,000 yuan per dan. The profits for wholesale and retail have been regulated. However, with distribution prices like 150,000 yuan and sugar powder reaching 310,000 yuan, most of it flows into the black market, where the price has risen to over 200,000 yuan per dan, and retail sales have risen to over 2,000 yuan per catty. The general public does not enjoy the benefits of fair prices. Therefore, the bureau consulted with the company and convened representatives from the City Chamber of Commerce, the Sugar Industry Association, and the Dried Goods Industry Association at 4 PM yesterday to discuss improvement measures. Attendees included Taiwan Sugar Corporation executives Shen Zhennan and Song Yixin, medical industry representative Chen Nanzhou, Dried Goods Commercial Guild Executive Director Chu Rupin, and City Chamber of Commerce representative Luo Qinghua, among others. First, Bureau Chief Wu Kaixian chaired the meeting and decided on the following: (1) To establish the Shanghai Fair Price Sugar Review Council, with all representatives present being appointed as members. (2) To adjust the distribution price to 140,000 yuan per dan for medium sand sugar and 130,000 yuan for raw sand sugar. (3) To set the retail price at 1,000 yuan per catty, with sugar purchase certificates issued to citizens and a reasonable profit margin given to the selling stores. (4) Wholesale to other cities will be handled by sugar merchants. (5) Sugar distribution to other cities will be directly applied for from Taiwan Sugar Corporation. (6) The company will increase its allocation after this adjustment and distribute as much as possible.</p>
<p>Another report states that the price of medium sand sugar in the sugar market yesterday exceeded 180,000 yuan, reaching over 10,000 yuan.

Two hundred boxes of Shimen sliced Qing were traded at prices ranging from 100,600 yuan to 8,000 yuan. Although enemy-produced sugar was auctioned, with over 4,000 pieces, it also fetched good prices. For example, four and a half cars of white sugar went for 257,500 yuan, three and a half cars of white sugar for 225,000 yuan, and sugar powder reached 310,000 yuan, with slight reductions for lesser qualities. Taiwan Qing was priced at 110,500 yuan.</p>
<h3>New Glutinous and Indica Rice Weak; Oil Prices Continue to Rise Outside the Market</h3>
<p>The rice market's digestion remains sluggish. Old glutinous rice is stable due to scarcity.

Yesterday's registration of buyers and sellers in the north and south markets totaled over 7,900 stones.

Raw kernels are stable, and yellow hemp is down slightly by 1,000 yuan. Corn from Qingdao is not moving and has fallen another 1,000 yuan.  Beans are also down by 1,000 yuan. The oil market is experiencing scarcity from Qingdao, with the local factory shipping little and production areas charging high prices, leading to a reverse flow and demand exceeding supply, with prices continuing to rise by 1,000-2,000 yuan outside the market. Soybean cake sales are weak, with a slight drop of 100-200 yuan.</p>
<h3>New Food Oil Prices Raised by 12%</h3>

<h3>Equivalent to Double Business Tax; Banquet Tax Should Not Be Excessive; Legislation Should Be Easy for People to Understand and Follow; Leave Some Room for Those Seeking Mere Sustenance</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The City Chamber of Commerce, acting on behalf of the restaurant industry's request to reduce the banquet tax, has submitted a letter to the municipal government and finance bureau with four proposed measures, appealing for their joint support. The letter states: "The Restaurant Industry Association of this city has requested four matters from your office (department): (1) To reduce the banquet tax to 10%. (2) To establish a daily food standard so that meals other than banquets are not subject to the banquet tax. (3) To reconsider the penalty measures for restaurant merchants failing to register invoices. (4) To exempt restaurant merchants from using unified invoices. These requests were submitted to your office (department) on August 31st. The facts and reasons presented are extremely detailed. The banquet tax currently levied in Shanghai has uniformly changed the method of apportionment previously used to a method of reporting and levying based on issued invoices. The method of collecting from customers has been canceled and replaced by merchants bearing the tax themselves, effectively paying double business tax. The burden is heavy and indeed difficult. Currently, various industries pay business tax at half the statutory rate. Therefore, the association's request to change the banquet tax to 10% of the tax rate is not without precedent and is consistent with the actual collection situation before January 1946. It is requested that this reduction be approved to allow the industry to breathe. The banquet tax is levied to restrict extravagant consumption by the people, and daily meals should not be included in the levy. Even if to prevent evasion of taxes by breaking up banquets into smaller meals, the starting price for taxation should be set according to current prices and the proportion of the gap between last September to avoid the current phenomenon of every restaurant being taxed, leaving some room for ordinary people seeking mere sustenance. The third and fourth points are purely procedural issues, but the methods are complicated and strict, akin to nitpicking, making people hesitant. The internal organization and personnel of restaurants cannot be like those of modern corporate stores, with complete accounting procedures and trained accounting personnel. If the originally planned methods are implemented, it will inevitably lead to frequent mistakes and heavy penalties, which is not in line with the state's original intention of enacting laws to alleviate the difficulties of businesses. The association's request to supplement taxes and discuss penalties based on the discovered invoices is sufficient to demonstrate punishment and warning. The use of estimation methods will inevitably lead to large-scale harassment, akin to the fabrications of the past. Invoices are only used to record the number of meals and should only be clear enough to be effective. If a unified format is issued, it will inevitably lead to difficulties in use due to the uneven level of education of the users. All measures established by the government should be easy for the people to understand and follow, avoiding trivialities. The government's order to unify the invoices of merchants, starting with the restaurants with uneven levels of education, will create endless difficulties. It is suggested that it be exempted for public convenience."</p>

<h3>Verdict of Japanese War Criminal Sakai Takashi</h3>
<p>[Continued from the August 31st issue of this newspaper] While supervising the battle in the Nanhai area of Guangdong from November 1941 to March 1943, he allowed his troops to massacre countless villagers. The names of those who can be identified include Cai Li Shi and Tang Di Xiang, along with over a hundred others who were shot with machine guns or stabbed with swords. Civilians were subjected to cruel tortures such as waterboarding and hanging, resulting in severe injuries to nineteen people including Li Yong Gen and the deaths of Po Huo, Shen Qiang, and Lu Yong Lu. The most brutal methods of killing included hanging Li Hui in Shipai Village, Shatou Township, setting him on fire, throwing him into the river, and shooting him to death with machine guns.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in Huangsha, Guangzhou, the pregnant villager Ma He Shi, who was six months pregnant, was severely injured and suffered a miscarriage after being struck with an iron rod. Ouyang Liu Shi was beaten and thrown into the river to drown. In the valleys near Sanshui County, two young women were gang-raped by fourteen of his subordinates, who then cut open their abdomens and fed their blood to dogs. In Nanwen Village, villagers Xing Yi Mei and her husband were brutally dissected alive with kitchen knives, and died in agony. He also allowed his troops to drive civilians out of their homes in various parts of Nanhai County, leaving the elderly, women, and children displaced. He burned down over 700 houses, confiscated over 100 acres of paddy fields, and plundered countless amounts of food, poultry, and livestock from the people. On December 8, 1941, he personally led a large army to raid Hong Kong, assuming that the isolated island was defenseless and easy to conquer. He ordered his troops to conquer it within two days. However, due to the fierce resistance of the Hong Kong garrison, they did not land until the 17th of the same month. In anger and resentment, cruel thoughts arose. During the half-month after entering Hong Kong, he allowed his subordinates to carry out large-scale massacres, rapes, and looting in order to retaliate and display their power. British, Canadian, and volunteer soldiers stationed at Hong Kong military bases were killed after surrendering as prisoners. For example, on December 17 and 18, 1941, over thirty prisoners were massacred in a row at Lei Yue Mun. Twenty-four prisoners were massacred at the West Point battery. Those whose names can be verified include British gunner Macdonald and volunteer Guo and five others. On December 19th, already captured British soldiers Gosling and Mackechnie and volunteer K. Lim were massacred on Stanley Peninsula. On December 27th, fifteen prisoners were massacred at Yu Dong Xuan's villa in Repulse Bay. On December 29th, over fifty prisoners were massacred in Wong Nai Chung Gap. Many captured British Royal Scots were massacred in Repulse Bay, including Lieutenant Colonel Macpherson. Six officers and soldiers of the British Middlesex Regiment were massacred in Deep Water Bay. Most of the aforementioned victims had their hands tied behind their backs and were stabbed to death from the back with bayonets. Some were decapitated, and their skulls were crushed, and their brains were splattered. As for non-military bases that were purely Red Cross aid agencies and military hospitals, not only were all the captured wounded soldiers massacred, but the police officers and nurses who were engaged in treatment were also poisoned. For example, on December 19, 1941, near the Methodist Church in Shaukeiwan, members of the British Royal Army Medical Corps who surrendered were massacred, including Buchan, Watt, Newton, Mohan, Williams, Macforquhar, Dunne, Reid, Langley, Harrison, Kelly, and an Indian soldier, as well as five Chinese stretcher-bearers and Dr. Oroff and Brigadier Laurson, totaling about twenty people. They were either driven to the reservoir and stabbed to death from behind with military swords, or they were taken to the mountains and machine-gunned to death. From December 24 to 26, at St. Stephens Hospital on Stanley Peninsula, 60 to 70 captured wounded soldiers and 25 hospital staff were massacred. The method of killing was to massacre them in order from the sickbeds. The sounds of knives, swords, explosions, moans, and wails were deafening and unbearable. The nurses Miss Gordon, Mrs. Fidoe, Mrs. Simmons, and four Chinese women were raped in the hospital. Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Buxton, and Mrs. Begg were chopped into several pieces, their blood and flesh a blur. Lieutenant Colonel Black and Captain Witney, who were hiding in the toilet, were also found and stabbed to death with swords. J. Mokay, a Canadian rifleman, was brutally gouged out, his ears cut off, his tongue cut out, and slowly tortured to death. At the Catholic Maryknoll Church hospital in Stanley, three captured wounded British soldiers were thrown out of the window from a high building and fell to their deaths on the ground. Twelve captured wounded British officers and soldiers were beheaded. As for the Blue Pool Road in Happy Valley, which had nothing to do with the military and was the residence of Chinese people, groups of soldiers were sent to carry out atrocities. For example, at 6 PM on December 22, forty-eight residents were massacred at No. 2 Blue Pool Road, including Zou Yue, the son of Central Committee member Zou Lu, as well as Xie Fencheng, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Communications, and Wang Zhongchang and his son. Pregnant women were raped, and girls as young as twelve or thirteen were gang-raped. Their property was looted. On the same day, cavalry rushed to No. 42 Nanpu Road and massacred over thirty Chinese residents. Mai Zuoheng, an employee of the Central Trust Bureau, was also stabbed nine times but escaped because the wounds were not fatal. In addition, on December 18 and 28, 1941, multiple women were raped in Anle Village, Fanling, Kowloon. The sound of screams never ceased at night. He also incited wolves to bite pedestrians, which was inhuman. Furthermore, he paid special attention to seizing our country's cultural treasures. After occupying Hong Kong, he ordered Major Miyaki Hiroshi to lead a team to the Fung Ping Shan Library of the University of Hong Kong on Bonham Road to search for and seize 111 boxes of rare books from the National Central Library. He also seized 20 boxes of Western books and magazines deposited in the Wing On Warehouse in Sai Wan that belonged to the National Peking Library. The various atrocities are too numerous to record. After the end of the war, he was captured by the 11th War Zone Command and transferred to the prosecutor of this court for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<p>Reasons</p>
<p>The defendant and Meijiro Umezu were both major figures in implementing Japan's aggressive policies in China. During his time as the commander of the infantry unit and chief of staff of the Tianjin Garrison Army, he violated international conventions and engaged in undermining the integrity of our country's administration and territory. Initially, he used treacherous parties to organize plainclothes teams to disrupt Tianjin and Beijing and secretly set up assassination agencies to assassinate key party and government officials. He then used force to threaten our military and political authorities to dismiss the administrative head of Hebei Province and withdraw the Hebei garrison, in an attempt to realize the proposition of the five provinces of North China separating from the Central Government and independently exercising autonomous political power. This fact is not only substantiated by the secret telegrams from former military and political leaders of North China to our Supreme Military Authority, the telegrams from former Tianjin Mayor Zhang Ting-e describing the situation in Tianjin and Beijing at the time, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Substitute Telegram No. 1005, which detailed the hard demands made by the defendant and Major Akahashi, the military attache of the Japanese Embassy, to the Beijing Branch of the Military Affairs Commission on May 29, 1935, but can also be verified. Furthermore, Gao Xingya, who often participated in the investigation of party and government affairs in North China, testified clearly in court. It is also consistent with the statement made by "Major General Tanaka Takayoshi of this army in Tokyo on July 9th of this year before the Far East International Tribunal, which stated that 'Colonel Sakai was a subordinate of Umezu Mijiro and was the most ardent advocate of separating the five provinces of North China from the Central Government and establishing five independent autonomous political powers.'" (See Attachment A) As for how the defendant, while serving as the commander of the 23rd Army stationed in Guangdong, organized a peace army to support a puppet regime, there are secret telegrams attached in the dossier from Chen Niaozu, the puppet governor of Guangdong Province, to Wang Niaoming and Chen Niaojun reporting on the political situation supervised by the defendant's subordinates Yazaki. Next, during the defendant's operations in the Nanhai area of Guangdong, he allowed his troops to massacre over a hundred innocent villagers, including Cai Li Shi and Tang Di Xiang. He also abused his power by applying cruel punishments, abusing and killing women and children, displacing civilians, plundering property, burning down over 700 houses, and confiscating over 100 acres of paddy fields. These facts have been testified to in separate sworn statements by eyewitnesses Tang Teng, Cen Ji, Tang Wanhua, Tang Bao Ru, Tang Zao Ping, Wu Wei Min, Tang Gen, He Feng Shi, Cai Xue Shi, Tang Yuan Zuo, Cao Yu Qing, Xie De Min, Deng Wen Yao, Zhou Cong, Tang Sui Fang, Cai Heng, Pan Chang, Zheng Lie Min, Li Shi Lai, Lu Yu Ming, Tang Liang, Feng Huang Guo Xian, Hu Jing Wen, Tan Yong Zhao, Tang Man Cheng, Tang Shen, Yuan Yi Sheng, Gu Bao Lin, Ming Fu Yi, Cui Jian Nan, Xie Xing Chi, Zhang Duo, Liang Chen Shi, Chen You, Chen Hong, Chen Zu, Tang Cheng, Feng Chi, Zeng Wen Feng, Wang De, and Chen Huan Xin, Chen Zai Ting in the Guangzhou District Court of Guangdong. Furthermore, the rape and murder of two women in Sanshui County and the vivisection and killing of the Xing Gumei couple in Ya Cliff have also been confirmed by witnesses Zhang Xianao and Xing Yijiang. (See Attachment B) After the capture of Hong Kong, he allowed his troops to brutally kill surrendering prisoners and wounded soldiers and Red Cross personnel engaged in aid work. He used iron rings to cuff hands and employed cruel methods such as gouging out eyes, cutting off ears, cutting out tongues, beheading, and dismembering. The abuse of civilians, gang rape of women, and looting of property have been testified to under oath by on-site witnesses Li Yafu, Oshley, Tan Yash, Mary Su, Zhang Ruiling, Shi Wen, Genningham, Stanley Martin Banff, Ma Nian Cao Qianshi, Chen En Guang, Philip. Miss Gordon, Mrs. Ander Lee Yong, Fitzgert, Anderson Mack, Lai Lianshi, Yan Honglin Sanxian, Zhang Feilie, John Wesley Glenn, Mai Zuoheng in the British Army Prosecutor's Office in Hong Kong. These sworn statements have been signed by Yang Deyi, a war crimes investigator dispatched by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Southeast Asia, Major Colbert, a member of the War Crimes Investigation Team of the British Army Headquarters in Hong Kong, and Major Zorevintov, Deputy Judge of the 4th Military District Prosecutor's Office of the Canadian Army and Commissioner of the Supreme Court of Quebec.

<p>Do Not Let Prices Cause Disturbances</p>
<p>Prices had finally stabilized for a while, and the labor unrest that had been emerging here and there had fortunately subsided. Suddenly, like a bolt from the blue, the increase in the exchange rate was announced, and all kinds of prices experienced huge fluctuations. Of course, the authorities have legitimate reasons for increasing the exchange rate, and it has been seriously discussed by many experts. The intention is to curb the dumping of American goods, encourage the export of domestic goods, stop the leakage of national funds, and save the precarious domestic manufacturers. It can be said that this is of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>However, what is the reality before us? Not to mention foreign goods, even goods that have nothing to do with foreign exchange have risen by several times. Even firewood, rice, oil, and salt, and even the vegetables in the vegetable market, have followed suit and increased in price. Although the authorities have repeatedly admonished businessmen, those who speak earnestly are met with disdain. What can be done? Only the workers who live on meager salaries are suffering. Their monthly income was already insufficient to cover expenses, and now it has been discounted by 20-30%, which is truly heartbreaking!</p>
<p>Now, we can only appeal to the authorities to use decisive measures to suppress the unreasonable price increases. Otherwise, the hidden worries for the future are just beginning!</p>

<h3>Answering Readers' Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(1) Redemption of Farmland</p>
<p>Asked by Song Youwen of Wuxing</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Wang, being unable to repay the debt he owed me in 1929, used one mu of rented inheritance land to repay the debt at an agreed price. My mother handled this matter (I was still a minor). At that time, no contract was drawn up as proof, and Mr. Wang soon passed away. Unexpectedly, in 1942, Mr. Wang's nephew, using evil forces, wanted to redeem it at the original price (one silver dollar counted as one legal tender). I refused because the value of the currency then and now differs by thousands of times. I would like to ask (1) How should this be handled legally? (2) If he agrees to redeem it, how should the currency value be calculated? (3) Can I ask him to collect rent and public grain rice during his management period?</p>
<p>[Answered by Lawyer Cao Yaxia] Since the transfer of ownership of this land was not legally established, although he occupied it peacefully and continuously for ten years with the intention of ownership, and did not request registration as the owner, its nature can only be recognized as a pledge payment, occupying another person's real estate and having the right to use and profit from it. When Mr. Wang's nephew forcibly occupied the land, he could claim restitution as the occupier and remove the obstacle, but this right to claim has already expired due to not being exercised within the statutory period. For the current disposition, if Mr. Wang's nephew is not a legal heir of Mr. Wang and does not have ownership of the land, he can negotiate with Mr. Wang's legal heirs, and let them come forward to claim ownership and take back the forcibly occupied land from the nephew. If he is a legal heir of Mr. Wang, and the land has been taken away, evidence or proof of the price Mr. Wang pledged the land for during his lifetime should be provided to be compensated. (2) You can request the court to fairly rule and make a judgment to increase the payment in accordance with the law. (3) If Mr. Wang's nephew is not a legal heir of Mr. Wang, then the legal owner can collect it from him.</p>
<p>(2) Housing Dispute</p>
<p>Asked by Chu Songyin: In 1937, I rented out my extra house to someone, stating at the time that it was temporary, so no contract was signed and no lease procedures were completed. Unexpectedly, they have lived there for several years, and both parties' children have grown up. The housing is not enough, and I have repeatedly pleaded with them to move out and take it back for my own use. They said that they did not have suitable housing at the time and would move out immediately when they had a house. They suddenly moved out last month on the 25th, leaving behind a few broken odds and ends, and did not return the lease. After checking the household registration, I learned that two people were still not reported (eight people in total). Can I set a deadline for them to return the lease? Is there any conflict with the Lease Law?</p>
<p>[Answered by Lawyer Cao Yaxia] If the situation of taking it back for self-occupancy is necessary and true, and there are ways to prove it, the lease can be terminated, and the house can be taken back. The deadline should be notified at least one month in advance and the end date of each rental payment period should be the termination date of the contract.</p>
<h3>New China Bank Holds Student Loan Program</h3>
<p>The New China Trust &amp; Savings Bank has been holding student loan programs for underprivileged students for many sessions, with excellent results. Starting this year, in view of the expensive tuition fees and the difficulty of entering school, it has decided to entrust the Bank Association to continue running the program. Registration has already begun. It is reported that the loan program held by the bank this year is limited to senior accounting, banking, and applied economics majors. Those interested can request the regulations from the Bank Association at 59 Hong Kong Road and go through the registration procedures.</p>
<h3>"Eye Disease Prevention Campaign" Registration Deadline Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The "Eye Disease Prevention Campaign" jointly organized by this column and the Relief Hospital at 547 Xizang South Road has received an enthusiastic response since applications began on the 23rd. The first batch of 150 people is about to reach the limit. We hope that middle school and university students and faculty members with eye disease will apply for registration at the hospital as soon as possible. The deadline is 5 PM tomorrow. Please do not miss this opportunity.</p>
<h3>Relief for the Lonely and Destitute: Sixth People Approved in the Fifth Batch</h3>
<p>Entrusted by Elder Qingxia, this column is managing the relief effort for the lonely, destitute, and sick. In the fifth batch, twelve people applied. Except for those residing outside the area and those whose procedures were incomplete, which were temporarily delayed, six applicants were approved. These include: Chen Zhenqiu, 60,000 yuan; Liu Axiang, 50,000 yuan; Chen Zhangzhenying, 70,000 yuan; Wang Jimin, 70,000 yuan; Xu Qianru, 80,000 yuan; and Du Licai, 60,000 yuan. The above-approved individuals should bring their original neighborhood head and guarantor-signed and sealed receipts to the office to collect the funds after receiving the notification letter from this newspaper. Furthermore, the relief fund is about to be exhausted, while applications continue to arrive daily, creating a "no rice to cook" situation. The plight of the lonely, destitute, and sick, teetering on the brink of starvation, is truly miserable. We hope that kind-hearted individuals at sea will generously donate to prevent any interruption. This would be a great act of kindness.</p>
<h3>Service Briefs</h3>
<p>Lost Money to be Claimed: Mr. Fang Jin feng of the Shanghai Post Office Western Orchestra, while passing near the Social Affairs Bureau on Lin Sen Central Road, found a bundle of banknotes and a seal. The owner is requested to prepare a receipt and come to the office to claim them. Mr. Fang's honesty in not pocketing what he found on the road is commendable and worthy of respect.</p>
<p>Free Clinic and Medicine: The grass shacks and sheds in the Jum en Road area of this city are densely populated with impoverished people who lack health knowledge, making them susceptible to illness. Recognizing this, the Guan Sheng Charity Association, with the support of Mr. Wang Huiting of the Construction Industry Association, established a free clinic and medicine dispensary at No. 7, Lane 360, Jumen Road, with the contributions of various members. They have appointed two traditional Chinese medicine physicians, Ma Wenwo and Sun Siqing, to provide consultations from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM daily. The association's dedication to society and its benevolence towards the poor and sick is commendable.</p>
<p>Lost Keys to be Claimed: A reader of this newspaper found a set of keys and a flute on Third Ma Road, Huajin Lane. The owner is requested to claim them from this column.</p>
<p>Lost Certificate to be Claimed: Huang Baoyu, of 676 Linsen Central Road, found a graduation certificate from Nanhui Luxi Middle School belonging to Mr. Li Zhuen, and a packet of cash. The loser can quickly go to Mr. Huang's place to claim it.</p>

<h3>Soviet Russia in 1946: The Kremlin's One-Party Rule, but Not Against the Will of the People</h3>
<p>— Written by Atkinson, New York Times Correspondent in the Soviet Union, Translated by Dong</p>
<p>To discuss friendship and cooperation with the Soviet government, we must abandon our conventional notion of "friendship." We usually think of friendship as a close relationship or a politically well-intentioned compromise—such friendship is neither necessary, possible, nor existent in Soviet relations. Because the Soviet government is a political machine, various interpersonal approaches are ineffective.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the Russian people are admirable—sincere, hardworking, practical, powerful, sensible, and courageous. But to establish relations with the Russian people, we must first engage with the Soviet government. This government, despite its high-sounding rhetoric of "democracy," is actually a one-party dictatorship. The so-called dictatorship of the proletariat is, in practice, a dictatorship by the thirteen members of the Communist Party Politburo.</p>
<p>There is no freedom to speak of within the Soviet Union. To the best of my knowledge, this government does not act against the will of the people, nor is it corrupt, although there are occasional irregularities, such as the recent factory fraud case and the Crimean rebellion. My overall impression is that the Soviet people largely believe in and respect their government authorities.</p>
<p>However, because the Soviet government is essentially a machine, its task is to generate power and exert influence both internally and externally. Therefore, any strategy based on friendship is bound to fail. We are not enemies with the Soviet Union, but we are not friends either. In the coming years, we can only achieve a state of "armed peace" at best.</p>
<p>Never Scruple to Use Any Means to Achieve the Goal</p>
<p>When dealing with the Soviet Union, we must adopt their customary power politics when faced with conflicting interests. Of course, this is an extremely reactionary approach, but we must recognize that the spirit of the Soviet government is fundamentally reactionary. This can be seen in its attitude towards defeated nations and the Red Army's actions in the Northeast. The Soviet government, having become accustomed to using force internally, naturally thinks the same way externally. Westerners who have witnessed the Soviet Union's actions are often horrified.</p>
<p>Why is the Soviet Union so difficult to deal with? There are many reasons, of course. One is that the current Soviet leaders rose to power through violence. During the revolution, they had to seize power in a hostile environment. Even now, they believe that the methods of 1917 are the shortcut to success. Under the tyranny of the old Russian emperors, they developed a habit of absolute obedience to discipline for the sake of revolutionary work, and they also learned how to operate secretly. The Soviet leaders owe their current position to this vigilance and obedience to discipline, and they firmly believe that they must continue to do so to expand their authority.</p>
<p>A common belief among Soviet government officials is that they never scruple to use any means to achieve their goals. Perhaps it is for this reason that the first socialist country in history has not only failed to liberate workers, but has instead turned workers' labor and thoughts into slaves.</p>
<p>The Russian Revolution was originally a large-scale underground operation. It was planned underground, using deception, violence, and secret maneuvers. This approach still exists today. The Soviet government still keeps everything secret. Foreigners don't know what the Soviet government is doing, and even the Soviet people don't necessarily know much. Sometimes, they know even less than foreigners, because some information leaks abroad. The violent methods of the revolutionary era also persist. No one can say how many millions of political prisoners are imprisoned or exiled. Estimates range from ten million to fifteen million. No other government in the world has so many problems waiting to be solved. The Soviet government not only has to carry out an industrial revolution and a political revolution, but also needs to find effective and rapid ways to educate the people.</p>
<p>The Soviet government's domestic policies can be said to have achieved great success, but the general leaders always feel insecure, which is difficult for foreigners to understand. Stalin is probably the most heavily guarded person in the world. In Russia, every citizen and foreigner must carry identification cards and passports at all times. These measures, which we consider wartime measures, are the daily security guarantee in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>No Resistance Movements in Various Parts of the Soviet Union</p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge, there are no open movements resisting the Soviet government. It is widely rumored that the island of Crane is dissatisfied with the current government, believing that the island of Crane suffered excessive losses during the war and that the government should be held fully responsible. Last December, the Soviet Communist Party headquarters was burned down, which is generally believed to be an anti-Soviet conspiracy. However, the Soviet government's position is solid and it has the ability to subdue all reactionary forces. This is because it led the Soviet people to victory in the war against Japan. The Communist Party naturally takes credit for itself, even denying the contributions of various allied countries in defeating Germany, and claiming credit for defeating Japan.</p>
<p>Except for sometimes blaming the government for the hardship of life, the general public believes in the government. However, the Soviet government authorities always feel insecure. They probably believe that the country is so backward that they should have full authority to implement national policies in a short period of time in order to improve its status, and should not allow criticism or opposition. They treat domestic affairs in this way, and foreign affairs as well, except that they do not have the guarantee of news control abroad, nor the means to prohibit opposition.</p>
<p>Part of our difficulty with the Soviet Union is due to the ignorance of the Soviet rulers. Most of them have never been abroad, and have developed a morbid fear of the outside world after being isolated for so many years. The spirit of the Soviet government is xenophobic. Since the bloody purge of 1936, they have always had an inexplicable fear of foreigners, considering them either spies or enemies. Therefore, Soviet people who contact foreigners are regarded as betraying the Soviet Union, and the rulers are the same. Intimate contact with foreigners carries the risk of being relegated to the cold palace.</p>
<p>Most people believe that Stalin is the most knowledgeable person in the Soviet government. However, he still does not understand freedom or democracy. His understanding of foreign countries is mostly based on his past Marxist indoctrination and the unfair reports of his current ambassadors and journalists abroad. The leaders of the Soviet Union are all eating "isolated" pies. Despite having information about foreign countries, they lack the experience to analyze it. Because they have always lived behind the "Iron Curtain," they lack what we consider normal judgment in all foreign affairs.</p>
<p>After the Moscow Conference last December, many foreigners believed that Soviet decision-making was returning to the pre-war situation, recognizing capitalist countries as the inevitable enemies of the Soviet Union. In this atmosphere of fear of the outside world, it is naturally much easier to rule the people.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in Soviet Russia is fundamentally abnormal. The result of isolation has made its ideas and culture stagnant. The result of news censorship makes the general public have a neurotic reaction to rumors. For example, when Churchill gave a speech in the United States criticizing the Soviet Union, the news was withheld for many days. When it was finally released, the general reaction was so intense that it seemed like an atomic bomb was about to be dropped. With the experience of World War II, we all know that international political and economic cooperation is the only way to avoid war. But the Soviet Union's experience tells us the importance of global cultural and intellectual cooperation.</p>
<p>Soviet Xenophobia is Actually Neurotic</p>
<p>There are no new ideas in the Soviet Union, always rehashing old patterns. All the newspapers say almost the same thing on the same day, in almost the same way. With few exceptions, every writer's work is similar. Because of the Soviet government's isolationist and xenophobic policies, and because it strictly enforces censorship of news and prohibits the publication of news, Soviet culture has become lifeless and mired in customs.</p>
<p>I don't understand science, so I can't judge Soviet industry. I only know that the level of Soviet art is very low. From all aspects of observation, I can say with certainty that the level of Soviet drama, art, and music is low. I suspect that the Soviet people themselves are aware of this. In general, Soviet literature and art lack vitality and have reached a state of stagnation. Under the power of political suppression, people have few opportunities to develop their individuality. In this abnormal atmosphere, all mental illnesses flourish. The most unreasonable thing is the pathological fear of the Soviet government authorities. They are afraid of everything, thinking that everyone is an enemy, and fearing that they are in danger of being surrounded and attacked at any time. But in fact? With the vast territory, rich resources, and courageous people of Soviet Russia, this mentality has no basis at all.</p>
<p>There is a common cliché in the United States that the Soviet authorities are a group of extremely cunning and outstanding talents, but I believe that they are actually mediocre, do not understand democracy, and cannot see clearly the actions of democratic countries.</p>
<p>The fundamental reason for the disharmony in international relations is that the Soviet Union is a socialist country that is seeking development and a way out in a capitalist world. According to the Communist Party, as long as capitalist countries such as Britain and the United States are in a dominant position like the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union is in danger of being invaded.</p>
<p>Now, the Communist Party's view is still the same: The fascism of "monopoly capital" is preserving the power of fascism in preparation for attacking socialism. The Soviet newspapers portray the United States as a militaristic imperialist country, expanding its influence in all directions in the world and infringing upon the sovereignty of small and weak countries. The "monopoly capitalists" of the United States? They are the enemies of the world's peace-loving people.</p>
<p>International Week</p>
<h3>A Series of International Conferences, A Series of International Issues</h3>
<p>— Chu Yuchen</p>
<p>Although the world's political situation after the war is constantly in turmoil, the waves have never been as turbulent as this week. There is a sense of one wave not settling before another rises. In the middle of last week, the Ukrainian representative, Manuilsky, suddenly sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations General Assembly, Trygve Lie, regarding the continuous border conflicts between Greece and Albania, accusing Greece of endangering peace to the United Nations Security Council. He also accused British troops of staying in Greece, interfering in Greek internal affairs, and creating a turbulent situation in the Balkan Peninsula. This was a bolt from the blue, throwing a bomb at the Paris Peace Conference and causing the representatives of the 21 countries to panic and not know how to deal with it. However, the Security Council had no choice but to include this complaint in the agenda of the 28th meeting. The Soviet Union's diplomatic counterattack has thus begun.</p>
<p>Four Foreign Ministers Reopen Meetings</p>
<p>The Paris Peace Conference has been meeting for thirty days, and only heard the grand theories of representatives of the various countries. There has been no success. The proposed amendments to the peace treaty submitted by the representatives of the various countries are piled up like mountains, totaling more than 250. Taking only the draft treaty for discussion, almost every article needs to be amended. Assuming that these amendments are all proposed for discussion and representatives of the various countries are allowed to express their opinions freely, the conference will probably not be able to "successfully close" by the end of this year. However, the objective international environment does not allow the conference to be delayed in this way. First, the United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to open in New York on September 23, so whether these two important international conferences will be held simultaneously has become a serious issue. According to the current situation, the representatives of the United Kingdom and the United States advocate holding the conference and the United Nations General Assembly simultaneously. The Soviet Union believes that the United Nations General Assembly can only be held after the conference ends; China and France are in the middle, advocating that the conference should proceed slowly during the United Nations General Assembly. Therefore, in any case, the conference will lose its importance during the United Nations General Assembly, and at least international attention will be diverted. Therefore, the conference should try to speed up its work before the opening of the United Nations General Assembly. Second, Europe and the Far East are closely connected under the current international relations. If the stalemate in Europe cannot be broken, the problems in the Far East cannot be solved early. If the treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland cannot be established, the peace conference with Japan cannot be produced. Therefore, for the sake of the entire world's future, the Paris Peace Conference must speed up its work and complete its tasks as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Security Council Has Another Dispute</p>
<p>The United Nations Security Council also held a meeting in New York on the 28th of this month, first discussing the issue of several non-member countries requesting to join the United Nations organization. The countries requesting to join the United Nations organization include Afghanistan, Iceland, Sweden, Transjordan, Southern Ireland, Portugal, Albania, and Outer Mongolia. The United States representative, Johnson, advocated allowing all eight countries to join the organization, but this was opposed by the Soviet representative, Gromyko, who advocated handling them separately. Therefore, the United Nations organization membership qualification review committee of the Security Council began its work. First, it unanimously passed the admission of Afghanistan, Iceland, and Sweden to the United Nations organization. Later, when discussing the issue of the remaining five countries requesting to join the organization, opinions diverged and another dispute arose, preventing these five countries from getting what they wished.</p>
<p>Among these countries applying to join, the most noteworthy is Outer Mongolia. With the support of the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian Republic, she applied to the United Nations Security Council for membership. The United Nations Secretariat considered that the situation in Outer Mongolia was not well understood and needed to be investigated, and raised three questions for it to answer; The Chinese representative also requested the Security Council to postpone the discussion; However, the Soviet representative insisted repeatedly, so we abandoned the previous proposal. When voting, China and the Soviet Union voted in favor, and the United Kingdom and the United States voted against, so Outer Mongolia was still not approved to join the United Nations organization.</p>
<p>Accusing Greece: Britain and the Netherlands Oppose</p>
<p>The representative of the Ukrainian Republic, Manuilsky, accused Greece to the Security Council of endangering world peace due to the border conflict between Greece and Albania. However, when this issue was submitted to the Security Council for discussion, it was first met with opposition from Britain and the Netherlands, who both said that the Ukrainian representative's accusation against Greece was neither sufficiently justified nor sufficiently evidenced. Although the Soviet representative requested to invite representatives from both Greece and Ukraine to the meeting to state their opinions, this was also opposed by representatives of various countries. Therefore, this accusation was shelved.</p>

<h3>George Bernard Shaw, Still Vigorous in Old Age</h3>
<p>— (Translated from the "New York Times" by Xi Jie)</p>
<p>At the age of ninety, George Bernard Shaw is still as witty as ever—his sharp wit, gentle smile, and upright posture are still those of a straightforward thinker, forever a traitor in thought.</p>
<p>His life is serious and disciplined, and his living habits are largely the same as they were forty years ago. It's just that you will no longer see him riding around on a bicycle, or giving speeches in public; you won't run into him packing luggage, preparing for a trip around the world; and you won't see him swimming in the morning. He has long given up all of this, because he has other things to do. His day's work is quite tense, and he feels that he is too old to do those things again, while he feels that he is not old enough to deal with the intricate and complex affairs of the world. After starting a job, it takes him a long time to complete it. When that job is completed, he tells us what else needs to be done.</p>
<p>The issue that Shaw is least interested in is the issue of death. His vitality is so abundant that he wouldn't worry about such things. Many people who have long since died—William Morris, Nansen, Oscar Wilde, Wagner, Rodin, etc.—become lifelike after being touched by his few words. In his eyes, these people are still alive. Although he lives in seclusion in a remote rural area and is isolated from the world, he is actually at the heart of world affairs and has never left them.</p>
<p>Shaw is an optimist. His view of life is completely optimistic. He once said, "Life, whether it is happy or sad, successful or unsuccessful, is always very interesting."</p>
<p>Look at his daily life. He starts his day's work with intense interest. He gets up very early and doesn't go to bed until late at night. Every night, he listens to news reports from radio stations around the world, not letting a single word go easily. Regardless of whether it is sunny or rainy, snowing or stormy, he always runs to the small house at the end of his garden to work, where he sits quietly writing until noon. After meals, he closes his eyes and rests briefly on the couch. When work is particularly busy, he sacrifices his afternoon nap. In the evening, he always sits in an armchair, reading newspapers and books to relax, or listens to music or talk shows on the radio with great interest.</p>
<p>Although Shaw likes to lock himself in a room to continue writing books and articles, his life is not lonely. He often tells his friends in the old place, "I am starting to write a new drama!" In fact, the world is also eagerly waiting for him to write some new creations.</p>
<p>He is a realist. He is never pessimistic, never disappointed. He believes that everything in the world has hope of being saved, and he feels that he himself has many shortcomings that need to be corrected. He feels that as long as mankind has determination, it can also save its many shortcomings in the same way. He has tried various ways to save mankind. He has repeatedly ridiculed us, but still holds great hope, and is confident that his views are correct. He is always ready to listen to the opinions of scientists, preachers, artists, and philosophers, and pool their wisdom in the hope of finding a solution to save mankind. Shaw can be said to be a truly courageous fighter.</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw is studying and creating a new type of writing that saves time and effort. He believes that language and writing should be as simple and expressive as the chirping of birds.</p>
<p>When I see Shaw's tall and upright figure, or when he sits comfortably and talks about world affairs, I get a new era consciousness, a simple and goal-oriented era consciousness. He may not have achieved his ideal, but he has already used his laughter and roar to make us move forward one step.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn (History)</p>
<h3>Trajectory</h3>
<p>— Hong Wei Fa</p>
<p>A person's rise and fall, honor and disgrace, often relies on luck, just like gambling, and this is especially true for men of letters. For example:</p>
<p>"When Yi Fu first met the emperor, Emperor Taizong ordered him to compose a poem about the island. Yi Fu said, 'In the sun, the morning colors rise, and in the zither, night cries are heard; The imperial garden has so many trees, yet I don't share a branch to build a tower.' The Emperor said, 'I will give you the whole garden, not just a branch.'" (Records of Tang Poetry, Volume 4)</p>
<p>This is the story of Li Yifu.</p>
<p>"Emperor Ming summoned Hao Ran to recite his work. He recited, 'I have given up writing to the emperor in the north, and returned to my humble cottage in the south. The talentless are abandoned by enlightened rulers, and the ailing are alienated by old friends. White hair urges old age, and the green sun approaches the end of the year. I yearn with sorrow and cannot sleep; the pine moon shines through the empty night window.' The Emperor said, 'Did you not seek me, or did I abandon you? Why didn't you write of vaporous clouds rising over Dongting Lake, and waves rocking Yueyang City?' Therefore, he became an official." (Records of Tang Poetry, Volume 23)</p>
<p>This is the story of Meng Haoran. In fact, regarding "The imperial garden has so many trees, yet I don't share a branch to build a tower," and "The talentless are abandoned by enlightened rulers," one could say that both express resentment, or one could say that both express a desire for position. However, one met Emperor Taizong, and the other met Emperor Ming, resulting in one rising and one falling, one honored and one disgraced. Because the power of rise and fall, honor and disgrace, lies in the hands of others, and depends solely on their momentary likes and dislikes, there is naturally no trajectory to be found. If this lack of a traceable trajectory constantly occupies one's mind, it will lead to sadness and resentment, increasing the speed of one's own destruction.</p>
<p>Lu Zhaolin, one of the Four Paragons of the Early Tang, was naturally very pitiable in terms of his life experience. According to the Old Book of Tang, he "resigned from his official position due to wind sickness, and lived in the White Mountain, focusing on taking medicine. Later, his illness worsened, and he moved to Mount Jucishan in Yangdi, writing 'Discourse on Relieving Illness,' 'Five Laments,' and other works, with the style of a poet, and was highly regarded by scholars. Since Zhaolin was bedridden and disabled, unable to bear the suffering, he bid farewell to his relatives and then threw himself into the Ying River to die. He was forty years old at the time." What a tragic scene of a tragedy's ending! However, the New Book of Tang says, "Zhaolin believed that during Emperor Gaozong's time, officials were esteemed, while Empress Wu Zetian esteemed the law, and he alone esteemed Huang-Lao (Daoism); After the Empress sealed Mount Song, she repeatedly recruited virtuous scholars, but he was already abandoned. He wrote 'Five Laments' to express himself. As his illness persisted, he said farewell to his relatives and drowned himself by the Ying River." According to this account, his tragic destruction of himself was not only due to the unbearable suffering of wind sickness, but also greatly related to his constant preoccupation with the untraceable trajectory of rise and fall, honor and disgrace. This is truly self-inflicted suffering.</p>
<p>The Stories of Emperor Wu of Han says: "The Emperor once arrived at the Langshu office and saw an old man with white hair and beard, and incomplete clothing. The Emperor asked, 'When did you become a courtier, and why are you so old?' The man replied, 'My name is Yan Si, from Jiangdu. I was a courtier during Emperor Wen's reign.' The Emperor asked, 'Why have you not been successful?' Si said, 'Emperor Wen liked literature, and you like military affairs; Emperor Jing liked the elderly, and I was young; Your Majesty likes the young, and I am old: Therefore, I have not been successful in three reigns.'" The "Miscellaneous Records of a Rustic Guest" says: "This matter is very similar to Feng Tang's situation. The Bai Tie says that during the reign of Emperor Wen of Han, Feng Tang was a courtier with white hair. The Emperor asked him, and he replied, 'I have not been successful in three reigns.'" Whether it is Yan Si or Feng Tang, their spirit of not complaining about themselves and doing things their own way is always worthy of admiration. I think writers who are faithful to literature and art should continue to advance along their own trajectory!</p>
<h3>Professor and Daughter (Novel)</h3>
<p>— Shi Bei</p>
<p>Today at noon, Professor Sun returned from teaching at school, having to walk more than four li to get back to this house. This house was on the edge of a small village, with a row of low fences surrounding a corner of vegetable garden in front. Under a camphor tree on the side of the house was a wooden cage; leaning against the wall were several rows of bamboo poles for drying clothes. These were all things that Professor Sun and his daughter, Mei Jing, had put together to make the place more orderly.</p>
<p>Although the village was far from the school, the preparatory class attached to the school was located here, and every three days, people from nearby villages came here for the market, so on Sundays and market days, the place became lively. There were many osmanthus and maple trees in the village, and there was also a small river in the front village, with dense weeping willows on both banks, covering the river with green shade in the summer, making the river water look like a piece of green jade. Professor Sun's house was right next to the riverbank. To those who love rural scenery, this was a very quiet and elegant place, but some people who were used to living in urban mansions would not even be willing to take a single step inside.</p>
<p>Due to the impact of the war, Professor Sun had wandered from the coast of Central China to the southern border. One year, his wife died while fleeing, and his eldest son was studying at a university in Sichuan. Now, only sixteen-year-old Mei Jing was left to accompany him.</p>
<p>At the school, he taught courses in the history of English literature and selected English poetry. He had to go to school early every morning to teach. He once said to his students in the classroom, "I will still come as usual in stormy weather, but I will only not come if there is thunder and lightning during the storm. You can use this time as a standard for when I will be teaching. Because it is dangerous to run four or five li in the suburbs in stormy weather with thunder and lightning." He said this with a smile, but it was indeed his principle for teaching.</p>
<p>Now, he was walking closer and closer to home, dragging a faded coffee-colored cane, carrying a cloth bag containing a roll of English lecture notes and forty or fifty student attendance cards in one hand, and a bottle of oil in the other. Although he was over fifty years old, he was energetic, and his vigorous steps seemed to be measuring out the predetermined distance. His appearance and demeanor were completely that of an old English gentleman.</p>
<p>"Ah Mei! Is the rice cooked yet?" Professor Sun walked into the house, put down the things in his hand, turned around and went out the door, looking at his daughter who was drying clothes.</p>
<p>"It's already cooked, Dad. I even fried eggs for you! Waiting for you to buy oil, I can cook the vegetables and then we can eat... Rest for a while, and I'll pour you a cup of tea." Mei Jing didn't finish drying the clothes completely. She wiped her wet hands with her apron and walked briskly into the house.</p>
<p>She brought a cup of tea to her father, and then twisted the clothes in the basin dry and hung them on the bamboo poles before going back to cook.</p>
<p>It was already half past twelve, and the sun was scorching hot. There wasn't a breeze. His work at school and his life back home were as heavy and stuffy as the weather. He took a sip of tea, and beads of sweat dripped from his forehead. Mei Jing's figure, which had been turning around outside the door just now, was now active in the house. He watched silently. Although he had never mentioned his inner feelings for her to his daughter, every time he saw his daughter's thin figure, a painful scar was etched in his heart. This was something he couldn't express clearly, and he didn't know when this scar would heal.</p>
<p>He sat on the low stool in front of the door and wiped the sweat from his forehead and face with a handkerchief. The ancient red muscles of his cheeks, like the long ears of a Buddha, drooped downwards. They had once been very full, but now they were folded up. The thick lips under his mottled beard sighed softly.</p>
<p>He turned his face and looked at the clothes his daughter was drying on the bamboo pole. These were all washed for the students in the preparatory class. The monthly wage for washing clothes for the students was eight hundred yuan. At first, he didn't want his daughter to become a laundry woman, but for the sake of life, and because his daughter was born to be a diligent child, she always wanted to find some work to do at home to feel comfortable, and she also hoped to earn some rewards with her own labor to help her father. In this situation, even though he didn't agree, it had already become a reality. Now, Mei Jing was already washing clothes for more than a dozen students.</p>
<p>He saw the water dripping from the cuffs and edges of the clothes, like cold, clear teardrops falling on his heart, one by one. Gradually, he widened his eyes in pain and stared at them. He stood up, wanting to run over and twist the clothes drier for his daughter, but he saw a figure walking past outside the fence. He instinctively froze for a moment, and then suddenly sat back on the stool. The sweat on his forehead, like blooming flowers, overflowed and rolled down, overflowed and rolled down...</p>
<p>"Dad! Dinner is ready!" Mei Jing called out loudly from inside the house, and the sound of moving bowls and dishes could also be heard.</p>
<p>"Dad!..."</p>
<p>"Oh! I'm coming!"</p>
<p>"Dad, look, these two eggs were laid by our hen. These small white vegetables were sown ten days ago. I transplanted the seedlings, and they've grown so big in just a few days. Once they're cooked in oil, they're as green as a cat's eyes!"</p>
<p>He didn't say anything. He took off his glasses, which were covered with moisture from the hot rice, and moved the plate of eggs in front of his daughter.</p>
<p>"Dad, are you unhappy today?"</p>
<p>"No,... eat more eggs."</p>
<p>The scene outside the door just now continued to form a deep impression, stimulating him.</p>
<p>At dusk, a gentle breeze blew from the shade of the weeping willows on the riverbank, lightly brushing the leaves of the camphor tree, making a rustling sound. The distant clouds should have painted a beautiful picture for the late-blooming life!</p>
<p>At this time, Professor Sun looked relaxed, sitting on a bamboo recliner under the camphor tree, smoking a cigarette. He had already smoked three in a row.</p>
<p>Mei Jing was wearing a long dress with small blue flowers on a white background that she had worn two years ago. But she had grown quickly in the past two years, and the clothes no longer fit well. Because of this, her innocent and lively nature had returned to that of a child from a few years ago. She brought out a thick old photo album of her father's from the house, and also walked to her father's chair with a cup of tea in her hand.</p>
<p>"Dad, look, the cover of this photo album has fallen off. We haven't looked at this album since we left Xiamen that year," Mei Jing sat down on the stool next to her father and opened the photo album, placing it on the armrest of the recliner.</p>
<p>Mei Jing cherished this photo album the most, because it contained the shining brilliance of her golden childhood and recorded the traces of her father's dreamlike past life. Professor Sun also loved to recall past joys from this photo album. From many photos, he loved to tell about his life abroad, or the exotic customs and scenery he had personally experienced, which were things that Mei Jing never tired of hearing and had endless novelty and attraction. Professor Sun could also temporarily dissolve into the pleasure of old memories. The so-called transcendence of life is sometimes really about being able to gain imaginative satisfaction from other people's descriptions of pleasures that cannot be obtained, or being able to relive pleasures that have already disappeared. These two father and daughter gained the highest comfort at this time.</p>
<p>They talked about interesting things and looked at the old and beautiful photos. The cool evening breeze blew through their mottled white hair and dark black long hair intertwined together. Only on evenings like this could they forget the heaviness and suffering of daytime life, but this time was only a fleeting moment, and then the shadow of the night came up.</p>
<p>"Ah Mei, you go to sleep first. I still have to correct some practice notebooks."</p>
<p>"Dad, you have to go to sleep early too!"</p>
<p>After these two sentences were spoken, the shadows of the father and daughter under the tree outside the house disappeared.</p>
<p>Usually, Mei Jing was as busy as her father, doing the laundry, planting vegetables, raising chickens, and managing the household chores all by herself. She didn't mind the busyness of work, because lately her father often came home with a silent and melancholy look, so she pretended to be lively and happy. She knew that this could reduce her father's troubles. She had once thought: Why is Dad a returned student and has been a university professor for more than ten years, but she has been deprived of the opportunity to receive an education? This kind of thinking has long been driven away by her current work. Having wandered with her father for many years, she was no longer a girl who only knew how to act spoiled.</p>
<p>But her father's melancholy did not decrease. When he woke up in bed the next day at dawn, he heard the sound of his daughter washing clothes by the river. He wanted to call out "Ah Mei," but the sound reached his throat and was swallowed back down.</p>
<p>The sun rose, and morning dew covered the grassy path. Professor Sun's slow footsteps were heading in the direction of the school.</p>
<h3>Outside the Door</h3>
<p>— Hao Ran</p>
<p>Under the scorching sun of midsummer, trudging like a camel across thousands of mountains and rivers, I finally arrived safely in front of my former residence, from which I had been separated for nine years. In an instant, my spirit became unusually tense, and my hot blood boiled, as if a commoner who had lived in the city for a long time had stepped into the deep palace of a despotic emperor. In that solemn and quiet atmosphere, I deeply felt my own insignificance. Indeed, it seemed that I was no longer the owner of this house. Otherwise, why would I hesitate again and again, pacing back and forth?</p>
<p>Outside the door, everything around should not be unfamiliar! At least, in the hazy dreams of the past, a faint impression remains. After being ravaged by countless storms of wind and rain, and smoked by the daily setting sun, the red paint on the door panels has peeled off piece by piece, which is the same as the possible scene I imagined. But the two bright and shiny large copper rings are still firmly embedded in the door, radiant and shining, like a pair of giant eyes watching the distance. I reached out and gently touched them, and then retracted my hand, because I was afraid of damaging their majesty. Copper rings! Haven't you resounded in my childhood dreams? Why are you silent now?</p>
<p>Outside the door, this semi-circular, slightly raised cement stepping stone used to be the temporary bed of many beggars. Now it is still white and solid. Every square and every line on its surface is familiar in my memory. Being in this area, even without entering the hall, I have already felt a warmth that is not found outside! Because inside this door is my home, home, the tailboard of the spirit! Home, the source of happiness!</p>
<p>I stood uneasily, imagining the tense and intimate scene of our first reunion. I must cherish this scene and engrave it in the depths of my heart, so that I will never forget it even after a lifetime! Is it a dream? Is it an illusion? Or is it iron-like reality? At this moment, I doubted a little again, because in countless dreamlike scenarios, I had also experienced standing outside the door. So, I turned my head and looked at the small car repair shop opposite, at the row of slender and distracted plane trees on both sides, and at the cloud of dust rolled up by the cars passing on the dirt road.</p>
<p>Driven by some unknown force, I suddenly realized that the place where I was standing was under the scorching sun. I felt the bursts of stimulation of ten thousand silver needles all over my body. My sweat had already penetrated a layer of undershirt, and my shirt was also a little damp. Moreover, a traffic policeman cast his eyes on my hesitant expression. I could no longer appreciate the scenery outside the door, so I pressed the doorbell, preparing to let my brothers and sisters, whom I might not recognize, come out and ask the guest's surname and name in surprise.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng 22</p>
<p>This situation lasted for at most five minutes, and the gunfire stopped. Suddenly, I saw the searchlight in front of the truck light up again.</p>
<p>"Old man! Come quickly!" the child's high-pitched voice called out.</p>
<p>Before I could run close to the truck, Little Tiger had already greeted me, handing me the pistol in a relay race style. I saw that he seemed to be holding a Mauser pistol in his other hand.</p>
<p>"Tidy up here, I have to chase after them for a while, several Japanese devils have run away." Before he finished speaking, he had already run off.</p>
<p>"Tidy up!" This was the order the child gave me. I should do it as quickly and as well as possible to satisfy him; what if another truckload of Japanese soldiers chased after us?</p>
<p>I quickly inspected the truck. Except for the light on top of the cab, which had been destroyed, everything else was intact; it could be driven. I used the simplest and clearest language to explain to the drivers that the Japanese soldiers had been driven away; I told two people to carry the driver's body off the truck and throw it away (this was Little Tiger's first shot). I also told them to carry all the wounded soldiers onto the truck. We tore off the Japanese flag hanging on the truck and replaced it with a white handkerchief to avoid misunderstandings at the National Army checkpoints.</p>
<p>"What about the dead, sir?" the crowd asked me noisily.</p>
<p>"Carry them on too, as long as they are our people... Hurry... You are all patriots!" I encouraged them.</p>
<p>I saw that more than half of the drivers had blurry patches on their faces. I knew that those were wounds caused by bayonet stabs or rifle butt strikes, and the blood flowing from them was the result of the "Imperial Army's" bravery. Some of them were limping with every step; presumably their legs were injured.</p>
<p>"Did the Japanese hit you?" I asked a driver who was walking past me, staggering.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir... These past few days, it's been happening every day. I just won't let them check, can't I still pull the wounded soldiers?"</p>
<p>Listening to his tone, it seemed like this action was of a voluntary nature. "That can't be, can't you still eat?" I asked myself this question in my heart.</p>
<p>"How much should I pay? Let me pay!" I was preparing to pay them.</p>
<p>"Money? We can't fight the Japanese, can't we still be patriotic?" He stubbornly answered my insult to them.</p>
<h3>After the Snow</h3>

<h3>Traffic, Traffic</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The terrible condition of Shanghai's traffic is unsurpassed today. This situation is not only deeply felt by us pedestrians, but also deeply understood by the mayor in his car.</p>
<p>In all honesty, the environment is complex, the funding is tight, the public morality of the citizens is questionable, and there are many difficulties. Improvement is not something that can be achieved overnight. However, people will remember the words spoken by Beethoven—a great musician of the world—to the Vienna City Government in 1819:</p>
<p>"I wish to prove that those who act with kindness and nobility will surely be able to bear hardship because of it."</p>
<p>Regarding the traffic problem, which is closely related to the personal safety of all citizens, I don't know how many times it has been bothered to listen. The reason for this is nothing more than that the first responsibility lies with the municipal authorities. We even think that whether the Shanghai municipal authorities are derelict in their duties can be used as a touchstone for traffic; we even think, how was it during the Concession era, and how is it now that it has been recovered? Please take a little care of your face and stop letting people laugh at you!</p>
<p>We dare not say that it is the result of our nagging. We can only think that it is something that the municipal authorities have long been harboring. In the past few days, the efforts of the authorities, people who have passed through the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road, as well as the intersection of Nanjing Road and Xizang Road, can talk eloquently, proving that there are planned resolutions to rectify and actively improve the situation.</p>
<p>It is said that Police Chief Xuan Tiewu said at a graduation reunion of military academy classmates:</p>
<p>"If military vehicles continue to drive without license plates, please don't blame me for not considering the relationship between classmates!"</p>
<p>This conscientious attitude, combined with the planning of the Public Works Bureau, is also a major reason why the city's traffic can gradually get on the right track. We not only praise, but also are equally willing to support the efforts of the municipal authorities in this regard!</p>
<p>The municipal government has just started to do it, and it is worth our praise if it can do it, but we are willing to reserve the greatest cheers until after achievements have been made.</p>
<h3>Inside Story of Pickpockets</h3>
<p>— Jin Lu</p>
<p>When you discover that the valuables in your pocket have disappeared, you don't have to be upset. The most appropriate way is to be careful next time!</p>
<p>The Lao Zha District Branch of the City Police Department recently arrested fifty-two "pickpockets," including men, women, old, and young. In order to promote public awareness, they held a grand performance of pickpocketing techniques in the open space of the bureau, which was also fresh, interesting, and eye-opening. It is said that there are as many as a dozen different methods of theft.</p>
<p>"Pickpockets" can be divided into two categories: those who specialize in picking money are called "claws"; those who specialize in pushing people or obscuring movements are called "decoys." In some cases, many "claws" act alone, without the help of decoys. Moreover, "claws" are mostly dressed neatly, looking very much like "young masters"; "decoys" always look like guys who make people hate them. In popular places and dark places, these "experts" can be divided into "trouser pocket hands," "flies," "watch pocket hands," and "beer hands" due to different skills.</p>
<p>"Trouser pocket hands" are the most skilled tycoons in the pickpocketing industry, with extremely nimble hands and feet. "Flies" are roles who specialize in stealing women's handbags, mostly mingling in department stores and other popular shops. "Watch pocket hands" specialize in picking pockets inside men's coats. The worst is "beer hands." The so-called "beer" refers to drunks and sleeping travelers. Pickpockets who do this business don't need any skills at all, so this is also the first step in becoming a pickpocket.</p>
<p>"Pickpockets'" methods of pickpocketing also advance with the times. Sometimes, they are also very good psychologists. They often hang around places where there are signs that say "Beware of Pickpockets" because when people see these signs, they always have to touch their pockets, and the more money they carry, the faster this reaction is. This is equivalent to telling the pickpocket, "My money is here." Detectives in Cannes, France, once discovered that "pickpockets" had opened a shop that specialized in selling ties at particularly cheap prices. When customers were crowded, the store clerk shouted, "Beware of Pickpockets." At the train station in St. Louis, a vendor's balloon flew into the air by accident. People were attracted by the balloon and looked up into the air, so the "pickpockets" took the opportunity to carry out their activities on a large scale.</p>
<p>"Pickpockets" also worship "old men." The river water does not interfere with the well water. Each has its own territory, so sometimes the stolen goods can be found. Sometimes you have important documents stolen, and when they find them useless, if there happens to be your business card inside, the pickpocket will mail them to you according to the address. This is pickpocket "morality."</p>
<p>The best "fat meat" for "pickpockets" are elderly people, blind people, nearsighted people, or people with several children.</p>
<p>When we go out, we should not carry too much money with us except for what we need. In short, you should pay attention at all times. When you are pushed in a crowd, or someone uses a newspaper or other covering to block your view, or someone asks you for a light for a cigarette and leans over, you should pay attention and take precautions. Don't think he is a respectable upper-class person, because you will be fooled if you only observe the other person's appearance.</p>
<p>Dear readers, beware of pickpockets!</p>
<h3>Prediction</h3>
<p>— Qi Xian</p>
<p>At major tram stops such as the Bund on Great Horse Road, Seymour Road, and Baidu Bridge, a large number of portable travel benches or rattan chairs will be set up for the rest of light tram passengers, charging fifty or one hundred yuan per person. Passengers will have the convenience of "sitting and waiting," and those who set up the chairs will also have considerable income, which will be a win-win situation.</p>
<p>After rickshaws and pedicabs are eliminated, new-style rubber trams will arrive in Shanghai. The carriages will be stretchable and have three to five times the capacity of existing trams.</p>
<h3>Heavy Burden</h3>
<p>— Fei Ling's Work</p>
<h3>The Hope to Make Good Use of the Baojia System</h3>
<p>— You Jin</p>
<p>Now that we have the organization of the Baojia system, I hope we can make good use of it.</p>
<p>Currently, the people can probably still name the head of the Jia, but as for who is the head of the Bao, if you ask any commoner, they probably would be dumbfounded and not know what you're talking about.</p>
<p>I have several friends who are heads of Jia, and they all say in unison: "We only did something when investigating the population during January this year. Now, only the head of the Bao has relations with the district office, and the head of the Jia is just a title without substance."</p>
<p>This phenomenon is, of course, due to a lack of good use of the Baojia system.</p>
<p>For example, why not use the Baojia system for the subsidized sale of sugar to ensure universal and fair distribution, instead of going through merchants? Once white sugar and brown sugar reach the hands of merchants, they all become "black sugar." Please see the news on the second of this month, "Corrupt Merchants Illegally Selling Subsidized Sugar, Ten More Businesses Punished, Citizens Encouraged to Report at Any Time." Previously, six businesses were punished, and now ten more have been punished. This was discovered after investigation, but who knows how many more there are that have not been investigated or discovered? The white sugar has turned into black sugar, and the people cannot taste any sweetness. Yet, you still expect the people to do the reporting. While this hope is good, it is a double hardship for people who only taste bitterness, sourness, and spiciness, but not sweetness.</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope that for all subsidized goods, it would be better to use the Baojia system and distribute them according to the population. For example, I live in the 15th district, which has 35,718 households and 178,411 people. The population of each district in the city is certainly clear, so wouldn't distribution be fair and efficient? It would save the people from having to report and the authorities from having to investigate. Is it that the district and Baojia heads are not trusted, and it is feared that they will "annex the six states"? Or is it because the merchants have not yet made enough money?</p>
<h3>The Most Interesting Thing</h3>
<p>— Xiao Yi</p>
<p>Tao La Sai Fei You Si, a famous songwriter of popular songs, was very naughty as a child. Once, in the sixth grade, her teacher asked her to write an essay with the topic "The Most Interesting Thing I Have Ever Seen." She handed in her paper after one minute. The teacher took her paper and saw that it read: "The most interesting thing I have ever seen is so interesting that it cannot be described."</p>
<h3>Comic Strip: Sanmao Joins the Army (92)</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Leping</p>
<h3>Filler</h3>
<p>— Suo Bei</p>
<p>The glamorous world, the dazzling Shanghai, there are too many fascinating places, too many fascinating things. However, after thinking for a long time, the most precious things are only two: knowledge and health. The former enriches life, so that you do not come empty-handed and leave quietly; the latter gives you more time to enrich life. Scientists believe that we should live for more than just a few decades, but because of excessive enjoyment, excessive "heartbreak," we are so short-lived, which is a pity. We must strive for health. But just being a workhorse is too meaningless. Besides health, we must know the most and understand the most. If you ask what is life? The answer should be: "Knowledge plus health."</p>
<h3>Talking About Long-Lived People</h3>
<p>— Gan Lai</p>
<p>The famous biologist, Mr. Bo Zhuhong, published his research results in 1935: believing that the standard for human life expectancy should be seven times the growth period. For example, a horse needs four and a half years to mature, so its average lifespan is exactly 30 years. A person reaches adulthood at the age of twenty, and should live to 140 years old. However, in reality, human lifespan is far below this standard. Most biologists and medical experts believe this is due to excessive mental and physical labor.</p>
<p>On March 26th this year, Moscow announced: Soviet scientists have completed a longevity serum that can slow down the rate of human aging. After a certain number of years, it is hoped that the average human lifespan can be extended to 100 to 150 years. This serum is called ACS and functions to preserve the connective tissue between continuous human cells and blood vessels, stimulate cell activity, thereby improving the work of various organs and prolonging life. This serum has passed the experimental stage and is being widely used throughout the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>If it is effective, then not only will sayings like "seventy is rare since ancient times" be overturned, but "five generations living under one roof" will also be commonplace.</p>
<p>In the past forty or fifty years, there have been many "long-lived people" in various countries. For example, in the "Abkhazia" region of the Soviet Transcaucasus, there are several centenarians: the oldest one is Mr. Ai Zhen Suya, who lives in Gevada Village, and is 157 years old. The second is Mr. Ge Shiba of Garizhen, who is 132 years old, with a total of 102 descendants. He created a town with his own hands. The third is Mr. Xia Zhijukefu of Kardakfa Village, who looks no more than sixty years old, but has actually lived for a century and twenty-six years. He has written several novels and is a brave hunter.</p>
<p>The oldest person in Egypt was named Ma Kefu, who died on September 1, 1935, at the age of 153. He had a son when he was 80 years old, and his son was already 73 years old when Mr. Ma passed away.</p>
<p>We also had a centenarian, a man named Wang Daochang from Kaifeng. In the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935), he was already 108 years old, with clear eyesight and hearing, and good spirits. He ate one catty of steamed buns per meal. It is unknown whether he is still alive.</p>
<p>As for the title of "the country with the most long-lived people," it belongs to Bulgaria. Bulgaria has a population of only six million, but according to official surveys, there are 162 centenarians. This percentage of "human rui" (people of exceptional longevity) is truly unprecedented. There are several points about these Bulgarian centenarians that are worth studying: (1) All 162 people are farmers, and most are herders in mountainous areas. (2) Their bodies are not tall. (3) They all married between the ages of twenty and twenty-five. (4) Ninety-five percent of these centenarians do not eat meat throughout their lives. (5) They mostly like to drink alcohol, with only 20% not drinking. (6) Among these 162 people, 77 are men and 85 are women.</p>
<p>In Mumbai, India, there is also a "village of long life" - Belgariib - the village head is an old man of 110 years old. House number 12 in the village is home to a family of seventy, with an average age of ninety years old. The oldest in this family is an old lady, who is already 125 years old. She fell from the window of the building to the ground, although she suffered minor injuries, she soon recovered. The name "village of long life" is well deserved.</p>
