<h3 id="c1">政府發表嚴正聲明　提出最後容讓限度　中共應負破壞判全責 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕二日四時半中宣部舉行臨時中外記者招待會，由彭部長學沛，外部劉次長錯主持，彭部長首宣讀政府對當前時局之重要聲明，原文如下：</p>
<p>政府已贊成開五人會議，討論改組國民政府委員會，最近又準備開三人會議，商討停戰之辦法，不料中共昨日突然發表聲明，抹煞以上兩種會議，以專斷之方式，宣布必須無條件停戰，其他一切均不願談。政府一向主張，用談判方式，以政治方法，求得合理合法之解決，如中共拒絕談判，破壞正將開會之兩項會議，則因此而引起之一切後果，自當由中共完全負其責任。　無條件停戰，曾於本年一月六月兩度施行，但因無切實有效之保障，以致隨停隨起，因之，十個月來，國家所遭之損失，日重一日，人民所受之痛苦，亦不堪設想。前此曾有停戰協定，整軍方案，而中共尙利用休戰期間，在其兵力優勢之處，即攻佔城市，悍然不顧，在其兵力劣勢之處，則乘機充實，整理其軍備，以圖再舉攻　國軍，今共黨又一面發布動員命令，一面又提停戰口號，如再無確實之保障，則政府對於國家，負維持治安秩序，對人民負保障生命財產之責，不能任令國民長受內亂之痛苦，故必須對於政治軍事上之迫切問題，求得合理合法之解決，以求切實有效之保障，而建立氷久之和平。政府已將下列要旨，函吿馬帥及司徒大使。</p>
<p>府委及駐軍問題　應迅速予以解決</p>
<p>政府爲節省時間，掬示衷誠起見，特坦率表明，其對解決時局可能讓步之最大限度如下：</p>
<p>（一）中共不斷催促國民政府改組，而改組之關鍵爲名額之分配，政府原同意國民政府委員名額內，中共爲八名，民盟四名，共十二名；中共則要求中共十名，民盟四名，共十四名，茲政府折衷讓步，中共八名，民盟四名，無黨派名額中一名，由中共推薦，政府同意，共十三名，中共應即行提出國府委員中共方面之名單，及其國民大會代表名單，但此項協議，由非正式五人小組會議協定後，仍交由綜合小組，取得協議。（二）爲切實實施整軍方案，先行迅速規定中共十八個師之駐地，並遵照規定，期限進入駐地。此項決議，應由三人會議正式協定後，交由軍事調處執行部監督施行。</p>
<p>如中共眞有和平合作之誠意，並願迅速解決此二問題，則雙方當於獲得協議時，立即宣吿停止軍事行動。記者會旋即於六時散會，晚間記者曾以此詢中共代表團對政府聲明之反響，據發言人梅益稱，政府方面之備忘錄，已於今晚飭專人送滬，中共態度將視周恩來代表閱後並請示延安方面始可回覆。又政府此項聲明發出後，南京中央日報即於下午六時半發行號外，首都民衆均獲對時局有一新認識，並深體政府容忍謀和之苦心，時局之轉變現又復停止於期待之中矣門夫婦，一日抵京，二日下午王外長在外部官舍予以接見。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京二日電〕有關方面頃就一月十三日簽訂停戰協定以來，共軍違反協定，攻擊國軍之重要事實，作一統計，並說明其經過及影響如次：（一）東北方面（一月十三日至五月底），政府與中共於三月十日頒布停戰令後，共方運反協定，突於一月十四日攻佔營口，以後續佔撫順，本溪，四平街及畏春，哈爾濱等地，復集結十七萬兵力於四平街，攻擊我北上接收主權國軍，東北戰事因以發生，並影響關內（按東北區共軍指揮官爲林彪，使用兵力約二十萬人）。（二）山東方面（六月上旬開始），六月六日主席頒布第二次停戰令後，共方竟利用此機會，在山東大舉進攻，九日佔棗莊，十日佔德州，泰安，置軍調部之約束於不顧，並佔高密，膠縣，南泉，藍村等城鎭多處。同時在靑島外圍集結大軍五萬，濟南外圍集結十餘萬，對該兩城近郊猛烈圍攻，尤以進迫靑島之水源地南泉，黃埠，情勢最爲險惡，濟南之煤糧區，圍攻亦爲猛烈，政府爲保衛靑島，濟南，遂有膠濟路戰事（按山東區共軍指揮官爲陳毅，使用兵力約十五萬人）。（三）晋綏方面（六月上旬開始），共軍攻佔候馬，集寗後，於六月上旬與山東呼應，復向山西大舉進攻，先後佔我聞喜，朔縣，新絳，楡次，介休，絳縣，山陰，寗武，繁峙，代縣，交城，　縣，懷仁，洪洞，趙城，沁縣，應縣，渾源，五河，霍縣，靈石，汾西等廿二縣，並積極破壞正太，同蒲兩路，逐步完成對大同，太原之包圍，因之惹起晋南戰事（按晋綏邊區共軍指揮官爲賀龍，劉伯誠，韓均，聶榮臻，使用兵力約九萬人）。（四）蘇北方面（七月十三日開始），六月三十日政府發布宣言，强調政治解決意願後，共軍竟集結十六個團兵力，約四萬餘人，於七月十三日突圍攻泰興，是役，我守軍八十三師因被迫倉卒應戰，致傷亡慘重，共軍於十五日攻陷該城後，續向泰縣及長江北岸要鎭口岸攻擊，企圖威脅京，滬，國軍被迫抵抗，乃發生蘇北戰事（按蘇北區共軍指揮官爲陳毅，使用兵力約四萬人）。（五）大同方面（八月三日開始），共軍自六月中旬開始，先後攻佔大同外圍之山陰，渾源，代縣，朔縣，懷仁，繁峙，應縣，寗武，蜳縣等九縣，復於八月三日展開圍攻大同之眞面目戰鬥，使用兵力卅餘個團，約五萬餘人，攻擊共卅五次之多，使大同郊外軍民傷亡慘重，並置政府屢次警吿於不顧，於是爲解大同之圍而有之□□戰事（按大同區共軍指揮官爲賀龍，使用兵力約五萬人）。又悉，共軍破壞停戰命令，攻擊國軍，自九月十三日迄今，共達四千八百五十二次。又自日本投降後，共軍在關內外曾攻佔縣城三百四十四個。</p>

<p>〔本報南京二日電〕滬參議會工商請願團，二日晨至農林部請願後，即至政院，謁兪鴻鈞。王雲五兩部長，縱續昨日之商談。兩部長表示對該團所提各點當予重視，並允轉達宋院長，談話自十一時開始，至一時結束，共達二小時。四時，各代表謁宋院長，五時辭出，一部份代表冒雨作玄武湖之遊，晚於通商銀行歡宴，潘議長公展亦參加。請願團經兩日之辛勞，分謁蔣主席·宋院長及各有關機關首長，爲上海工商業請命後，已結束其來京任務，將於二日三日陸續返滬，向滬市四百餘萬市民報吿此行經過。</p>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕宋院長二日下午四時於行政院接見滬參議會請願團各代表時，對政府目前財政經濟政策，曾作簡單之說明，並以極誠懇態度表明政府現正盡最大努力，謀目前財政金融情况之改善，使通貨不再澎漲，物價不再上揚。對該團所提在滬組織經濟復興委會事，宋氏感覺興趣。對其他建議，亦允虛心採納，並允令有關各部會商討切實辦法，能辦者即盡力爲之，其不能辦者亦不願作不着實際之諾言。宋氏今日着淡綠色香港衫，精神健旺，以道地滬語與各代表晤談，狀殊親熱，蓋各代表中儘多與宋氏相識一二十年者。在場之財部兪部長，經部王部長，過去與上海關係亦密切。故談話始終在極和諧之空氣中進行。</p>

<p>宋氏首先說明財政與經濟息息相關，財政若無辦法，經濟決難改善，反之亦然，一般人成責政府祗重財政，忽視經濟，其實不盡然。次說明目前經濟情况，指出局勢若澄淸，經濟早已好轉，惟情勢並不如此理想，目前華南情形較好，華北則因交通受阻，運輸不能暢通，生產受其影響，例如戰前華北產棉極豐，我國棉產幾可自給自足，現不得不大部仰給外人，煤斤亦須至秦皇島運取一部份，且須向外國購買，情勢如此，支出自見增加，收入隨之减少，收支相距乃日遠，彌補辦法有二：即增發通貨與設法增加收入，前者足以造成通貨膨脹，影響物價上揚，且足提高工資與利息，並非善策，故從增加收入着手，一凡足以增加財政收入者，當局皆盡力爲之，如敵偽物資，務求以最好價格售出，不令因賤價售出，而僅使少數人得其利。此外，如設立中紡公司等，其目的皆在使法幣得以回籠，收縮通貨，使收支得以平衡或接近，盡力做到通貨不膨脹，物價不上揚。至此，宋氏以堅決並有自信之語調稱：余所做者，皆係爲各位（指各代表）爲上海與爲一般人民，並非全爲政府各位所提關於工商農業貸款辦法，政府已知悉，決虛心接納，並將令各有關部會切實研究，能辦者決予辦理，不能辦理決不空作諾言，對貴團所提成立經濟復興委會時感覺興趣，蓋經濟建設不能僅作保存殘餘工作，且須求擴充與增加，將來日本對盟國之賠償，我國可望獲得大部份，此種賠償物資與工廠，不應僅予以出賣，似可組織一機構，共謀處理，定名不一定爲復興委會，由此機構擬具整個計劃，如人造絲機器可向日本索取，但廠基與流動資金等則須切實硏討籌劃，其他工業亦可用此方法，共謀進行。最後宋氏說明政府並無與民爭利之意，據稱：政府辦理中紡公司，係爲增加政府收入，當時若將日本紡織廠全部售出，目前即不能有此大宗收入彌補國庫。政府之政策，爲大事業除非國營不可能外，極願與各方硏究組織委員會，共謀策進。我人之眼光不應專顧目前，且須兼籌將來，日本賠款數量極大，問題端在究能利用多少，深盼能與諸位共謀如何善加利用。</p>

<p>宋院長詞畢，由各代表分別發言，奚玉書首先致詞，提出下列數點：（一）盼政府金融政策能靈活宛轉，銀行專業化，能早日實現，並放寬對商業銀行之管制，允許以財產作準備金，繳準備金限期亦自每月繳納改爲每季繳納，工農貸款方面盼能簡化手續，並能週而復始，使民衆能得實惠；（二）滬工廠深感電力不足之苦，盼能及早籌劃，以渡過各季難關，並盼對工廠放款時，地產及機器等亦尤其作抵押，蓋以原料成品作抵，勢將影響成本；（三）盼稅則能去繁就簡，並能培養稅源；（四）國際貿易方面應警惕於日本之捲土重來，並望對足以掉外滙之出口物資，能大量放款，輸入方面，若干物資應設法防制其入口，並防止走私，而對機器進口則應予以便利，結滙時不應以三個月能進口者爲限；（五）市塲對外滙不時發出無稽謠言，影響物價殊鉅，希望對美鈔掀風作浪者能設下陷馬坑，使作孽者自受其害；（六）國營事業應與民營事業受同等待遇，俾能均等發展。詞畢，由宋氏作答，說明對滬電力問題，政府已設法利用美船發電。並謂：許多現象是矛盾的，譬如今年各地大熟，且有大宗善救物資協助我進行善後工作，而剩餘物資對我建設亦大有益，所惜局勢未能澄淸，致政府不得不採過渡辦法，致有顧此失彼現象。繼由金潤庠致詞，說明政府困難即人民困難，人民疾苦亦即政府疾苦，得此機會互相說明，可增加彼此瞭解，對宋院長虛心採納民意，表示感謝，盼復興委會能早成立，做到官民團結。政府目前確有困難，然不能因此忽視經濟建設，希望能兩面兼顧，共渡難關。駱淸華發言，盼能廣泛延納人才，早日成立復興委會，解除工商痛苦，對於貸款亦不致人投機者之手，而尺度應略放寬，以慰民望。末由王延松致詞，希望國營民營企業間之界限能化除，並建議財經兩部延聘在金融界工業界有歷史有資望者而成立一諮詢委會，經常開會，以聽取民營之意見。宋對此建議，允與兩部長商量。會談至此，已歷一小時左右，適司徒大使來訪院長，諸代表乃興辭而出。</p>

<h3 id="c31">不懂做賣買！　蔣廷黻辭職前後　一個頗有操守的人下臺了　他也許會重回到教室裏去 <a href="#c31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕行總署長蔣廷黻的辭職，終於由行政院核准了。這消息的確有些令人覺得意外——何以行政院一直到現在才准他辭職呢？</p>
<p>蔣氏辭職已經不止一次，而行政院對他的處置也實在頗堪玩味。例如：行政院曾命令他編造行總預算，結果是開出了一個四千三百二十億元的相當可觀的數字。而行政院竟然一反向例，不折不扣的立刻批准。蔣氏當然着實高興，不相當他預備向行政院去領款時，行政院却說，這四千三百二十億的「善後救濟基金」，早已分撥農林部，交通部，水利委員會等等各有關機關，供辦理善後救濟工作之用；行總如果要錢，你向他們要去！</p>
<p>預算是行總辦的，結果却一文沒有到手；換句話說，就是政府不給錢。蔣氏就祇得靠向銀行借款和出賣物資維持開銷了，但是中央銀行的貝總裁剛剛接事的時候，卻不客氣的說了一句：「我們辦銀行不是做慈善事業，你要借錢，先拿抵押品來看看。」當然，眞要談到抵押的話，聯總一定會馬上暴跳如雷，何况聯總的署長賴伽第亞又是著名的天不怕地不怕的霹靂火脾氣！</p>
<p>說到賣物資罷，此事早已成爲衆矢之的，行總給人家駡「救濟本署」也無非爲此。而且，有一個時期中，救濟物資祗有食糧而食糧却是後來聯總明文規定不准出賣的，於是山窮水盡，行總完全無法動彈了。蔣氏祇好向行政院提出了四項辦法：第一，請撥款；第二，請准行總向銀行借債；第三，讓行總向聯總接洽，少運一點物資來，以便節省經費；第四，就是准他辭職。</p>
<p>宋院長聽了這話大不高興，說：「你們祇會得向我要錢，沒有錢就嚷辭職！你們會辭職，我就不能辭？」</p>
<p>所以　宋院長的辦法是旣不給錢，也不准辭職——可是，中央銀行總算是俯允行總之請，借款八百億，但是有一個條件，就是：每月行總必須歸還中央銀行一百億。</p>
<p>燃眉之急是解了，但接着來的是無數零零碎碎的小刺激，可惜我們暫時還不能在此地發表。</p>
<p>蔣氏是湖南人，脾氣相當爽直，而且是學者，是一個頗有操守的人。因之，他就有一股硬幹的勁——但是也眞虧他沉得住這口悶氣！</p>
<p>上月，行總在南京召集各分署，開了一次工作檢討會議，蔣氏在這個會議裘發表了一篇鋒芒畢露的演說，一反官塲向例，說話極其露骨。南京上海立刻都傳出了蔣氏要辭職的消息，而且大家都以爲蔣氏在爲自己的工作寫結論，其勢是一定非走不可的了。却不料行總忽然又發了一個否認的消息，不過「否認」得很勉强；那時本報在記載這消息時，曾添了一句「各方仍在密切注視中」。結果是：果然來了！</p>
<p>大家都記得，當年胡適之·丁文江·翁文灝·蔣廷黻·何廉等幾個人，同時放下敎鞭，走上政治舞台。現在呢，蔣氏像是碩果僅存的一個，行總這差使雖然難當，局面不可謂不大。傅孟眞先生說得最好：「人各有其短長，蔣氏一年來雖未能滿足各方要求，與直接上司齟齬，又有何事辦得通？我親聽見宋院長說：「蔣廷黻不懂做買賣」。我才恍然襟準是如此的！」</p>
<p>蔣氏也許會重回到敎室裏去，美國已經有三只大學都請他去敎書了。蔣氏的辭職是有意義的：他似乎象徵了「學者從政」之終結。我們似乎不能想像叫學者們去專門從事於「買賣」，是不是？</p>
<p>蔣氏的後任霍寳樹氏，是在銀行界服務極久的，想來對於一買賣」之精熟，是一定够標準的了，我們深信行總從此之後，一定能够面目一新。等到聯總遠東區大會在十一月間開會的時候，我們倒很想聽聽最會挑剔的美國代表吉配屈律克和蘇聯代表塞米那斯還有什麽話說？</p>
<h3 id="c32">張君勱代表民主黨　發表對時局意見　國大召開之前應先解決兩事 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕民主社會黨領袖張君勱，日昨代表該黨發表對時局問題之意見云：上月廿八日各報登載吳文官長對法國新聞社發表談話中，有一段如下：「政府方面，仍望中共及民主同盟參加國民大會。邀請書業已發出，中共與民主同盟均在被邀之列；若謂彼等必須拒絕參加，殊無理由可言，推行政治協商會議決議，召開國民大會，乃政府之政策」。記者問：「中共倘於最後拒絕參加，而使會議破裂，政府又將如何」？吳氏稱：「無論如何，國民大會，當依照預定日期，即本年十一月十二日召開，別無更張，目前仍望中共能參加會議』。</p>
<p>我們讀完這段文章，覺得牠給人一種印象，即政府決定依照預定日期，召開國大，而中共及民主同盟在接收邀請書之後，有拒絕參加之意。這種說法。恐怕引起全國人全世界的誤會。民主社會黨是與民主同盟爲合作的團體，政府談話中旣有牽涉到民盟的地方，所以民主社會黨應將立塲說明。</p>
<p>自從正月政治協商會開始以後，各黨對政治問題有一個瞭解，即以協商方法解決一切，彼此不訴諸武力。但在協商閉幕之後，國府名單與國大代表名單，因東九省問題發生，影響政府改組與國大召開等等問題，以致國府委員國大名單，竟未能交出，四月下旬蔣主席集五方代表，商議國大召集問題時，大家因爲國大問題關係國家統一，如由國民黨一黨召集，其他黨派不同意參加，國家所賴以統一的唯一機會，從此喪失，無法彌補，換言之，中國政治上之傷痕，僅靠此一條橡皮帶，使他生出肌肉，療治傷痕，當時我個人在塲，極力主張延期。這意思承蔣主席採納，而且現任經濟部畏王雲五先生在決定延期後，又起立發言，要求決定日期，而蔣主席答以倘定日期，必須依期召集，有日期而不召集，不如不定日期，因次決定延期依政治協商會之精神來說，以協商決定延期，應該再用協商方法決定召集日期，但政府方面在七月初忽又單獨決定國大須於十一月十二日召開。在七月中看來，召集日期旣在十一月相距尙有四個餘月，所以大家也並不着急，有四個月的從容期間，國家大事，一定有轉機。所以對於政府單獨的決定的召集日期，並未反對，亦未表示贊同，祗望各黨能共同參加，自然是一件最滿意的事。</p>
<p>但是六月卅日馬帥折衷方案未能簽字，此後國內局勢日壞，到了現在已經演成全面戰爭。這種做法與正月中開政治協商會之情形，迥然不同，是不須說了。在砲火隆隆中，同胞互相殘殺，財力人力之犧牲不知多少。政府的意思要將蘇北承德及其他問題，決之於武力。此種情形等於英國歷史上之薔薇戰爭及美國之南北戰爭。在此情形下，要各黨各派參加國府，參加國大，任何人都知道是不可能的事。所以我們的意思，在國大召集以前，應該解決的兩件事：（一）停戰，（二）國府，國大及憲法草案之協商。</p>
<p>（甲）停戰問題</p>
<p>今後國內能否統一，決定整軍方案能否實行。整軍方案猶之棋盤之全局支配，這方案在重慶時代早已簽字，到了六月卅日馬帥折衷方案中，重行提出。共產黨方面，亦已承認五與一之比例，仍舊不變，並且說兩軍在六個月內集中防地，加以編練。依此方案，所謂全局支配權，還是在政府而不在共黨，雖尙不能說軍隊已經國家化，但第一步工作，算已經做到。馬帥提出此方案，蔣主席在事前定必同意，而共產黨也已承認。所以在我們看來，國內和平之基礎，已因此方案而確立，除整軍方案外，另有一區一地之得失問題如蘇北，如承德乃至東九省駐軍問題，這點我們以爲實在是這次戰爭的主要原因。我們願提出下列各點作爲解決方法，（一）蘇北共產黨在六月卅日早已承認祗留一軍，所爭執者是駐軍應在淮安或在隴海路以北。我們希望中共同意將軍隊退至隴海路以北，（二）當時共產黨提出一，保留保安隊。二，地方行政不變兩條。我們希望中共放棄這兩點，由政府另任命一個爲雙方所信托之人，如冷禦秋者爲蘇北行政長官，來撫輯兵燹後蘇北，不許人民彼此間有報復行動，並將土地問題按照耕者有其田之原則，妥爲解決，（三）關於承德、，承德一地所以爲國共雙方所必爭者，在中央言之，該地足以威脅平津及山海關鐵路，在中共言之，爲張家口與東北交通之要站，在我們看來，依五六月所談，中央佔領承德，以承德城爲界，城以北可讓與中共，自不失爲雙方滿意之解決方法，（四）張家口，張家口一地，在五六月談整軍問題時，蔣主席原有要中共退出張家口之意，後因馬帥力　，蔣主席同意，所六月折衷案中張家口仍留歸中共，此次政府所以進攻張家口，起於中共先攻大同，現在火同旣已解圍，政府自應將進攻張家口之　，及時罷休，以實現蔣主席對馬帥之　言，並且表示不因一時軍事勝利而另有擴大要求之意。（五）東九省間題在六月談判之中早已決定，齊齊哈爾以北及延吉劃歸中共，中共應將哈爾濱交出並將中東路交通恢復，俾中央得履行對蘇條約之義務。</p>
<p>國內戰爭問題，應照上文所言作結束。（下文轉入第三版）</p>

<h3 id="c33">國際協調的途徑 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>自史達林元帥向倫敦泰晤士報記者發表談話，吐露了蘇聯的緩和語調以來，一般人士或期望三巨頭問能够有一次會面，以解決若干目前主要的紛爭，或期望蘇聯能够有事實的表現，以實際行動來緩和目今的局勢。但看到最近在歐洲的新發展，例如，蘇聯曾再度照會土耳其政府，堅持　靼尼爾海峽由蘇土兩國共同防衛，廢止蒙特婁公約，要求韃靼尼爾海峽應由黑海各國訂立公約共同管制；莫斯科電台廣播文吿，指責英美違反波茨坦協定，並要求將魯爾工業區置於國際共管之下以代替目今之英軍占領。諸如此類，似乎蘇聯的一貫政策依然堅定，則所謂緩和，還是問題。</p>
<p>關於韃靼尼爾海峽問題不是在蒙特婁公約的修正。隨着環境的變遷，改正關於海峽的現有局勢，在波茨坦原已成立協議。蘇聯的主張似乎在不以蒙特婁公約爲基礎，面重新建立起一種新的海峽制度，此項新制度以黑海各國爲中心，而以蘇土共同防南海峽爲前提。此種修正，不以蒙特婁公約爲出發點，向未能爲英美所贊同。所以當前次蘇聯提出要求修正海峽局勢時，土耳其固然能同意蘇聯的要求，即英美亦未予贊同。此事擱到現在，蘇聯仍舊重中前次的要求，再度向土提出照會、可見蘇聯對外政策所持的立塲，決不輕易放棄。在這樣的情勢下面言國際合作，恐怕祗是片面的希望。</p>
<p>至於魯爾的國際化，蘇聯以爲現爲英軍占領區的魯爾工業區未能切實執行波茨坦的協定，所以蘇聯主張將該工業區置於國際管制之下。蘇聯以爲在蘇聯占領區內一切軍事組織均已解散，一切納粹與法西斯份子均已逐出行政機構，亦無任何工廠可能用於軍事目的，而爲德國軍國主義基地的魯爾工業區，却未能採納此項措施，因而要求國際共管。我們倘然拿蘇聯的指陳和美國務卿貝爾納斯在史都迦特的演說同時循誦，便可知英美如何關注戰後德國民族生活的統一，而在宰割了的故德國疆土上，同時，又有人如何企圖在建築起一道高的墻垣或鐵幕，破壞著德國民族生活的統一。凡此，均爲雙方觀點的不同，國際合作所需要的，是彼此對於對方的觀點能有認識了解，進而能從不同的觀點中覓取同意，尋求協調。這需要雙方或多方的讓步；如果各方堅持己見，而欲强別人從同，似乎有失國際合作的本意。</p>
<p>史達林元帥旣有前項的談話，希望和西方國家加緊合作，倘使大家都有減意，自不難覓取協調的途徑。杜科門總統於日前參觀西點軍校足球賽時，對該校員生發表演說，重申對於和平之信念，可見美蘇兩國元首對於基本信念，彼此均有同感，同時，美國前羅斯福內閣閣員伊克斯及毛根韜在三十一州自由黨會議中發表演說，要求杜魯門總統與艾德禮及史達林舉行會談，「從速結束驚人之戰爭談判，」可知美國輿論方面，亦主張三巨頭間能够有一次會　。以解決目前主要的紛爭。我們於此，所要申述的就是：我們主張國際間應有更緊密的合作和協調，但我們必須恪守若干基本原則。大西洋憲章，四大自由，乃至聯合國憲章等，均是基本原則。我們不惜犧牲成千萬的生命，其目的便在確保這些原則，譬如尊重各獨立國家領土與主權的完整，尊重各國人民自行決定其政制等等，所以我們決不應輕易放棄這些原則。「雅爾達」已鑄成了大錯，人類的歷史上留了汚點。我們一方面要求國際協調，另一方面却不能容許「雅爾達」的重演。</p>
<h3 id="c34">納粹戰犯的宣判 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>紐倫堡國際法庭於一日對主要納粹戰犯宣判，計處死刑者有前空軍元帥戈林，前外長李賓特洛甫，前陸軍總司令季台爾等十一人，處無期徒刑者有前海軍總司令雷特，赫斯及芬克等三人，處徒刑二十年者有希拉赫及一斯比，處從刑十五年者有前外炎牛賴特，十年者爲前海軍總司令杜尼資，而宣吿無罪開釋者有前駐土耳其大使巴本，財政家沙赫特，及前衝鋒隊領袖弗里轍。關於後三人的宣吿無罪，紐倫堡國際法庭的蘇聯法官，曾提出異議，認爲他們應該判罪而不應開釋，關於赫斯，蘇聯法官亦以爲原判決不當而應處以死刑，但此項意見，未爲國際法庭所採納；僅爲判決文書中的附件，不過用以表示蘇聯的立塲而已。</p>
<p>此次紐倫堡戰犯的審訊，在歷史上是一件饒有意義的事。「戰犯」這一個名詞，是這次世界大戰後所興起的；在第一次世界大戰後雖亦有所謂審訊「戰犯」的計議，其後因情勢的推移，始終不曾成爲事實。以戰勝國的資格審訊戰敗國主要執政人物而控以罪狀，是一種新的觀念。在過去，若干公法學家，特別是德國的公法學家，以爲戰爭爲國家政策之延續，其本身不爲罪，僅在違反有關作戰的國際規定時，如不尊重紅十字旂、號及虐待俘虜等纔構成罪行。因爲有這種吸爭本身不爲罪的觀念，所以若干國家不惜以戰爭來作爲侵略的手段。在建立國際的法律秩序上，我們首應剷除這種錯誤的觀念，確認發動戰爭本身即爲罪行，參與這種決策的執政人物即爲「戰犯」。國家的政策，決定於執政的人物，故這些執政的人物不能逃避他們所應負的責任。這是在這個意義下，我們看見有紐倫堡戰犯的審訊。這次戰犯的審訊無疑地，是人類史上一個重要的里程碑。這是建立國際法律秩序的一個實例。</p>
<p>這些納粹戰犯被控的罪狀有四：（一）陰謀作亂，（二）破壞和平，（三）發動戰爭，（四）違反人道。此項罪狀的成立，就在指出發動戰爭因而破壞和平違反人道，其本身即爲罪，參與此項決策的人均應負法律的責任。爲了未來的世界和平，我們擁　這一原則的建立，以維繫國際的法律秩序。紐倫堡所判決的納粹戰犯，都是發動此次戰事的元兇，他們現在都處以應得之刑了，由於他們的處刑，我們可以確信現在東京受訊的日本戰犯，不久亦必將步這些納粹戰犯之後，而處以應得之刑，這實是國際司法上一件足以大書特書的事。我們深願由於這種新的國際法律觀念的建立，人類能不再以戰爭來解決紛爭，人類能够在國際法律的秩序下和平相處，那纔是審訊這次戰犯的最大收穫。</p>

<p>編輯先生：衛生局長張維答復參議員質詢時曾說起，有些運糞船把糞運到半途，就傾倒在黃浦江中，「預備自己化裝去察訪一下」，足徵張局長辦事之認真。但不知我們，住在無衛生設備之里弄內，每日見到清潔夫，將馬桶內糞汁，大部倒在陰溝內，這樣妨礙公衆衛生，最好也要請局長設法改正，則市民受益無窮矣。（李善揚）</p>
<p>土地稅契豈同苛雜</p>
<p>敝人原籍川沙，素居滬市，近據鄉人來滬，知悉吾邑縣府亦已開始辦理土地產權或變賣移轉登記，敝人日前親自下鄉，向轄區鄉公所，辦理移轉登記手續，補繳土地契稅百分之六，每畝估值三十五萬計算，附加費百分之二強，另加監征費百分之二強，登記手續必須由鄉公所間接代理，故委托辦理時，又須繳納手續費百分之五之鉅。總共須納費照估值百分之十五，與公布之繳納征值，幾達數倍之差。且巧立名目，似近苛雜，鄉公所實係一保田機構，藉間接登記之便，橫加手續費照值百分之五，實有借端浮收之嫌，民人等不勝遺憾。近聞吾邑召開保民大會，實深慶幸，敝人藉此機會提出，爲便利旅滬同鄉，有直接向縣府聲請辦理登記之便，以免憑藉需索，而蘇民困。〔奚一名〕</p>
<p>願吃飯時思及農民</p>
<p>貸款的需要，針對現實，惜無良果。你看糧貸，結果領導物價上漲，雖辦了幾個小官與奸商，何能彌補，全國消費羣的損失！即是農貸，還不是替惡勢力造機會，套去囤積或高利盤剝，所有貧農仍是賣青與借到三角高利。最近報道又舉行農貸，與其有名無實，不若收購米榖，待青黃時，照原價加官息，由保甲配售貧農，豈不實惠！如舉辦常平倉，兼可穩定物價，更爲實惠，異雷聲充耳而不雨。</p>
<p>農民是生產者，同時，亦是消費者，合作事業的幼，曷能稚抵禦紙醉金迷的轉手商，一再剝削，即使一部份物資由政府配售，（糖）絞盡腦汁，黑市依然，並不思及利用保甲配給，所以高物價，是農民的致命傷。當此農民受生活高壓下，需要輸血，或因政令變質，民怨沸騰，不啻予以動派之良機，確保治安區域，隱患益深，每味「七分政治」一語，顯示農民生活之改善，爲行政之主要課題，希望執政者「吃飯」時思及農民！（潘抱一）</p>

<p>（乙）政治問題　內戰問題照上文方法解決，而吳文官長談話中有「各黨各派有拒絕參加國大之意」，還得說明一下，在戰爭現狀之下，其他黨派無法參加國大，因爲這種國大，一定是單方面的國大，中央有中央的國大，延安有延安的人民大會，其他黨派參加在內，即等於參加內戰。三四十年來不停的內戰，使大家痛心，我們總希望這一次對日抗戰結束後，全國各黨團結一致，從事於建設，所以在四月下旬我主張國大延期，便是因爲要留下這個機關，以達到全國之團結，假定中央與中共各開各的國大，其他黨派參加其間，就等於助甲打乙，或助乙打甲。我們不願意讓這種現象繼續再生於今後，所以極力主張有統一的憲法，統一的國大，以造成國家的統一。如其中央平日號召統一，此次偏偏要單獨召開國大，我想此種做法，正與平日主張統一大相違反。蔣主席平日以抗戰建國自任，在抗戰八年之後，造成分裂的國家，想來決非蔣主席所願。所以我們主張先停戰。停戰以後，各黨各派自能團結，自能協力於建國工作。如上文所說的停戰問題，誠能辦到，則正月以來，政治協商會議中和諧的空氣，決不難恢復。</p>
<p>所謂政治問題，不外三項：一·國府，二·國大，三·憲草。一·我們先從憲草來說，在三四兩月中，五方面對於憲草問題，在憲草小組中所表現者，並無甚相懸殊之處，所以已經得到一致之結論。雖然還有部分未能完成，但是百分之八十總算成立。末了一天，中共曾經起立說明，「這是一個紀錄而不是草案」，但是我們知道他所以如此說，便因爲當時有在五月中召集國大的決定，而中共還未決定參加。如其有一個中共不參加的國大，而這份憲草拿出來，說這是中共贊成的。中共怕有這種情形，所以特別聲明，這是紀錄而非草案。至於當時大家業已同意各點，我想到了現在中共還是承認，不會所對的。憲草問題如再加上一二星期的工夫，憲草一定可以完成，並且照當時協定，拿來作爲唯一的憲草，各黨約束其黨員，負責通過，我想憲草完成是沒有什麼困難的。</p>
<p>二·所謂國大問題，朋友聽到中央方面的意見，好像中央總在懷疑中共沒有參加國大的意思。在我們從政協會以來的接觸，我們不感覺中共不願意有統一的國大或憲法。祇要中央同意於停戰，中共不難有參加國大之表示，至於國大人數依照四分之三，四分之一強的比例來商量，也決不致於有大困難之發生。</p>
<p>三·國府之改組，其中有幾個問題：（一）所謂十四人問題。原來所謂政府，是應該有同樣的意見與政策的人來組織的，政府應該是一個內部意見一致的單位。協商會中決定民盟與中共佔有十四席，好像假定國民黨是一方的，民盟與中共又站在一方面。成了一個兩方對峙之情形，當時所以有此否決權之規定，在黨外人心理上便是怕三件事。一·內戰，二·破壞人民　本權利，三·在財政軍事文化各方面仍舊有維持一黨專政之行爲。假定中央政府能一變其平日所爲專心致力於和平建設，拿出公平的精神，執行國家的法律與行政，不要說民盟可以與國民黨一致，即中共亦何嘗不能與國民黨一致。所以政府之中，不要拿十四人問題當爲難題，祇問他的政策是否民主，政府誠能避免一黨專政之行爲，各黨各派決無與政府爲難或在政府中與國民黨對立的意思。（二）除去國府十四人之外，還有行政院改組問題。行政院是執行機關，國府委員是決策機關，所以行政的實權在行政院，而不在國府，假定目前行政院不改組，要到憲法頒佈以後改組，恐怕行政院之改組尚在一年之後。因爲從現在起召集國大討論憲法，至少還要三四個月，而憲法頒佈之後在六個月內舉行選舉，可見行憲之時至少在一個月之後。假定聯合政府中之國府委員在國大召開前名單決定，而負行政實際責任之行政院，要到十個月後來改組，恐怕與一新天下耳目之意，太相違反，決非全國人士所能滿意的，所以我們看來，國府與行政院之改組不是兩個問題却是一個問題。</p>
<p>從以上停戰與政治問題來說，假定政府立刻停戰，政治問題之談判，必能在和諧空氣中完成，所以我們願意從團結一方面協助政府，如其不走這路，還是以單方面意思召集國大，那末，一定有三種結果：（一）單方面之國大，會使各黨無法參加，（二）延安一定召集解放區人民代表大會，促成中國分裂的局面，（三）我們內部分裂後，蘇聯拿華北做根據，美國拿華南做根據，因爲我們的分裂，更促成美蘇在遠東的對立，前幾天，有一個外國人來談話，有一句給我深刻的印象。他說：「分裂的中國便是第三次世界大戰之發端」，我心目中有如此一副未來的圖書，所以常有一種慄慄危懼之意，所以極力希望政府先行停戰，再商談政治問題，達到中國之團結，從統一的國大，議決統一的憲法，來造成統一的中國，這是我們民主社會黨唯一的希望。</p>

<p>頌虞寄自巴黎：</p>
<p>了。另據一位法國老留學生說：在德軍佔領期間，法國百業凋敝，法文字中Natilnal原意本國的，或國產的）一字，幾爲蹩脚貨的代名字，就和俄國革命後的羅宋二字，在中文中流行的意義相同。譬如喝一杯咖啡Nationl罷，或說上家館子Ntional罷，都是起碼貨、的意思，但自德國崩潰後的一年來，這字用者漸少，漸被淡忘，由此也可知法國已在</p>
<p>逐漸恢復自信了。法國人生性樂天，隨時隨地，不忘作樂。在這次戰爭中，法國所受的創傷痛苦遠過英國，但今日遊歷法境的人，再也看不出戰時的創痕，偶而有人提及，彷彿已是很渺遠的往事，而非復爲痛切肌膚的現實景物了。這和在英國截然不同，你在倫敦隨便跑幾下，總有人或有事物提醒你，這是戰亂新愈，一切在復興重建中。記者一次從巴黎坐火車下鄕去玩，坐的是三等車，相當擁擠，多數乘客皆不得坐位，擠立車中，但站着的人似多不以擠軋爲苦，反乘機互相作弄笑謔。後來車到項吉漾，又上來二對年輕男女，也擠在人中，不久便掏出口琴來吹奏，漸漸便有人和唱，又漸一漸幾乎全車響應，待歌聲稍息，便笑謔隨之，整個車廂，立時化成了一個群衆歌詠同樂會。這種</p>
<p>縱情享樂模樣在英國很難見到。英國人總是板起臉孔，成日陰沉沉，靜悄悄地祇知埋頭苦幹，和你談不上三句，他便要吿訴你英國在作戰期間的損失如何重大了，復興工作是如何的艱辛迫切了。有時聽了令人不耐，禁不住想間他一聲，整個戰爭重任，英國到底分擔了多少。記者一次到盧森堡宮去參觀歐洲和平會議，發現在宮內附設的酒吧間中，有新聞記者二人，一邊喝酒，一邊忙着記錄從無綫電中傳來的會堪演說詞，稍有空閒，便呷幾口酒，這樣工作不忘作樂狀况，恐怕祇有能在法國見到。提起喝酒，使記者不免想到另一件事。酒和香水，都是法國的特產，什麼香檳酒，白蘭地，葡萄酒，都以法國產的爲最有名。但法國本身消耗的酒量確也可觀，普通館子每飯必有酒，無論你喝與不喝，酒賬就算在飯賬裏，算你是喝過了的，反之咖啡則另算。至於稍奢侈的食店或舞塲中，更以開多少瓶香檳，作爲表示豪富的標誌。在我們一般不慣喝酒的人看來，每飯必賠酒賬，實在有點浪費。一次我偶然向一位法國人提起，館子中每餐有酒，道於不嗜酒的人豈非是一種浪費，他說：什麼呌做浪費，</p>
<p>法國人都喝酒的。他所說的當是實情。不會喝酒的人到法國去賠錢，祇能算活該。法國人愛美，所以藝術文學特別發達，即今在經濟艱難之際，爲了裝點美觀，依然不惜工本。譬如：巴黎市上很多石像，敎堂等藝術作品，每到夜間燈火齊明，從各種角度來照射此類藝術傑作，務使其美點畢露，路人皆有充分欣賞的機會，因此燈火往往徹夜不滅。巴黎這樣的藝術偉績甚多，每脊電費支出必因此而大增，但法人並不以此爲苦，反引爲榮。反之，英國則到處以經濟爲重，倫敦的街燈至今仍祇許開放三分之一，至於爲了裝飾用的燈光，更是不許開放，六月間爲了慶祝勝利節，所有白金瑛宮一帶石像週圍的弧燈開放一週，在英國便算是一件盛事，引得四鄕來看熱鬧的人，幾乎街道都擠破，這樣，從經濟觀點着眼，自然是到了上乘，但從人生享樂觀點來看，不免稍感寒傖。現在東歐一帶生活艱苦萬分，許多藝人多在國內無法謀生，紛紛逃到法國來，求一條活路，每到夕陽西下，塞納河畔，便可見到襤褸的藝人，鬻畫賣唱。據一位朋友指給我看，說其中很多是從匈牙利逃來的，他們之所以願意留住巴黎，恐怕不盡是近水樓臺，地理上的接近而已，也正是惟有巴黎才能找到主顧，才是末路藝人的樂園。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕蘇州蘇綸紗廠總經理嚴慶祥，現年四十八歲，上海人，被控有漢奸嫌疑，前於高檢處偵査期間，曾准交二千萬元現金保免押。後經正式提起公訴，於八月十九日由高院初審時，調査之下，認爲罪嫌重大，當庭重予扣押。昨日下午開庭續審，詢問一過，諭令改期再訊。</p>
<p>按起訴書中列舉之罪狀，約略可分四點：（一）曾任僞工商部諮議（二）代「中日貿易聯合會」紡織紗布，供敵軍用。（三）任僞棉花統制委員會監事。（四）卅四年春以江蘇省代表嚴吉名義，出席僞全國民衆大會。昨被告於庭上之供詞，與上次大多相仿。略稱：廿六年冬敵佔領蘇州後，蘇綸紗廠即被接收，歸敵內外棉紗廠管理，其間僞維新政府曾邀任僞江蘇省建設廳廳長未就，後由吳亞農向僞工商部騙得諮議名義之委任狀，經該部上海辦事處向敵興亞院交涉，乃得於卅年三月收回紗廠。但該偽職名義實係虛造，可請庭上向經濟部調查偽工商部組織中，有無此名義。棉花統制委員會成立於卅年秋，由蘇浙皖三省紗廠同業所組織，其目的純爲求統購，統買，統配之便利，與僞商統會無關。本人被推爲監事，會請辭職，故始終未去。卅三年夏，敵軍擬將不開工之機器敲毁，以鐵作軍需之用，經蘇浙皖紗廠同業公會開會議決，各紗廠代「中日貿易聯合會」紡織紗布，以免機器被損。蘇綸紗廠指定棉紗三百件，及布一萬四千八百八十疋，原料由公會供給，電由公會配給，工資亦由公會頒發。該批代紡棉布，本定卅三年交貨，但拖延至卅四年七月猶全未交出。勝利後，該批物資，已於本年三月十一日移交中央信託局蘇州辦事處。關於僞江蘇省代表事，係卅四年春，僞全國民衆大會於南京召開，當時被吿寓居蘇州，由偽江蘇省長任援道派人來邀出席，因家中置有第廿五集團軍發報機一座，恐被累及，經彼等威逼之下，乃隨於開幕日以嚴吉名義出席一天，翌日即因病返蘇云云。嚴昨衣灰色長衫，黑皮鞋，內着西裝長褲，鼻架眼鏡，頦下原有之長鬚已剃去，退庭後，仍還押忠監。</p>
<p>又僞江蘇烟酒印花稅征收所所長李翰青，昨由高院判處有期徒刑五年，褫奪五權五年，全部財產除酌留家屬必需生活費外沒收。另匈牙利人依理芝被控以酒精資敵等案，調査一過，改期再訊</p>

<p>〔本報特寫〕紅十字會的名稱，是大衆所熟稔的，但是紅十字會的起源和組織，性質和任務，却並沒有普遍地受人們所注意。爲什麼世界各國都有紅十字會？而旗幟都是白地紅十字的？首先揭起這個標幟的又是誰？</p>
<p>紅十字會創始於瑞士日內瓦，一九五八年，瑞士人杜南特從北菲返籍，取道意法戰爭的沙法利諾戰塲，目擊戰塲上死傷纍纍，呻吟哀號，血洒原野，慘極人寰，特地動員附近民衆及過境商客，共起救護，把傷者安撫，死者埋葬。其後他便週遊歐洲各國，宣傳他救死扶傷的主張，經過多次國際會議的召集和國際公約的簽訂，各國紅十字會便相繼成立，各國代表爲表示對瑞士國的敬意起見，特地規定瑞士國旗紅地白十字的反式—白地紅十字，爲救護傷病的標幟。自此以還，白地紅十字旗幟，便代表博愛和平，服務社會的崇高理想事業了。亦因爲紅十字旗幟飄揚所及，便有無數人獲得解救，所以紅十字標幟，所以紅人字標幟，便益發令人欽敬了。　根據一九三九年的調査，全世界已有六十一個國家成立紅十字一萬萬計，則每三十個人中，便有紅十字會會員一人。中國紅十字會，原是其中之一環。成立於一九〇四年日俄戰爭，已有四十二年歷史，但是過去因爲種種條件的限制和宣傳工作做得不够，正式加入爲會員的，爲數很少。光復以後，來上海復員的紅十字會幹事，對徵求會員經過一番努力後，現在上海一地，會員已擴增至六萬人，但是這個數目，在美國紅十字會的負責人看來，是　爲太微小的。在紐約城中，半數以上的市民，都是紅十字會會員。</p>
<p>各國紅十字會都有它的分會，少自數十個，多至數千個，我們中國紅十安會議前已有分會五百十二處，抗戰期中，受盡敵偽的推殘，或消滅，或失聯　，損失異常浩大，絡續復員的約有七十餘處，預期在後的一年之中，分會的數目，至少要增加四五倍以上。</p>
<p>紅十字會是個民間服務團體，它從前的任務是「博愛卹兵救死扶傷」，現在它的使命擴大了，不但戰時担任救護，且於平時推進社會服務工作，是貧病的救星。但可惜在上海，真正爲貧病而服務的紅十字會，就抵一所，那是們於新閘路八五六號，一所破舊的老式房子中。</p>
<p>該會的總幹事是股新甫，主要的負責人，有幹事童星星門，幹事兼服務課長汪　萬等，他們都　是把終身獻給社會服務，默默地苦幹的一羣。目前他們正在進行的慈善事業很多，舉其重要的有下列四大工作：（一）貧病診療—僅收掛號費二百元，覆診一百元，藥費全免，每天求治者約三四百人，以外科佔多數，由診療室王任侯崧生醫師親自診治。（二）兒童營養站—該會自行總配得鮮牛奶三百箱，除經常分配給肺病患者及營養不良者（須經該會醫師證明）免費飮食外，特舉辦兒童營養服務站，每天上午八時至十時，免費供飮淡牛奶，每日前往飮食的貧苦兒童約有四百餘人。（三）施送冬衣—該會自美國紅十安會得到大批救濟寒衣，計男孩褲九百條，絨綫衫一九五件，　布睡衣四百件，女孩上衫及三角褲多套，此外還有嬰孩用具六百包。因爲這些救濟衣服都太講究了，譬如嬰孩用具的包內，都是嶄新的法蘭　料製成的，有尿布，絨毯，睡衣，外套等，恐怕連中上階級的中國孩子都難得享受得到的，所以這使該會的負責分配人員覺得爲難了，把它配給赤貧吧，恐怕他們連用法都不知道，更怕他們會轉賣市上，而使中國紅十字會的信譽受到影響，所以他們在分配的對象上，經過很多腦筋，也　了好多手續的，除了委託本市各醫院按實際需要化爲分發外，現在尙有餘下的，他們務必使它配給眞正需要的人。（四）業餘補習班—創辦的目的，原是爲了使靑年會員，如學徒等有業餘補習的機會，但是開辦結果，倒是失學兒童佔了多數，這學期學費高漲，一般經濟拮据的　水階級子女，都續不起書了，他們除了只能望着校門嘆氣外，求知慾使他們找到了這個地方。化了二千元錢的報名費，每天夜間可以補習二個鐘頭，書籍費雜費全免，教員都是號義務的，只拿五六萬元車馬費。因爲投校的人多，該會已將辦公室，候診室都　作臨時教室了。</p>
<p>該會服務課課長汪君對記者說：看到中國清貧需助的眾多，像這樣的純慈善機關，在上海一地，至少要有十個，但是到現在爲止，就祗有該會一所。該會尚餘經費二千萬，但是他們要做的服務工作正不知道有多多少少！</p>
<p>記者自紅十字會上海分會參觀回來，除了徒增無限感慨外，只覺得像五十八歲高齡的幹事童星門，尚且日夜地爲那些貧病奔走，年青的一輩，該怎樣地有所警惕啊！</p>

<p>席間並由地政局按正沈璜報告契據審査工作。就中以道契及仿　登記最爲麻煩。道契係道合衙門所發，但其中產權　國人者亦頗多。且一部份曾由敵人處分，故疑問頗多。仿單係咸　五年所發，爲時已久，輾轉變賣，以致仿單與糧串相異，更有關單，査考對證亦殊繁瑣云。</p>

<p>（一）久咳不愈</p>
<p>蔣海齡問　小女年六歲，患咳嗽已近五十日，經醫生診斷爲百日咳，並注射百日咳血清3cc，又服普通止咳藥水，均不見效。茲有疑問數點請予解答：（一）小孩久咳日輕夜重，每咳必嘔，是否爲百日咳？（二）小孩之百日咳有特效藥否？（三）注射百日咳血清是否有效？（四）如不治療，能否漸漸痊愈？</p>
<p>〔醫學博士余新恩答〕　據述症狀係爲百日咳。注射血清若及早行之，可减輕病狀，否則不易生效，如能謹慎護理，尤其營養，屆時自愈。</p>
<p>（二）孕婦頭痛</p>
<p>何雲問　內子在未結婚前，即患耳疾，一年數發，發時甚感痛苦。婚後在受孕期間，耳疾發生甚少，然心煩，頭痛等症，則相繼發生，此固爲姙婦應有之病症。但其中以頭痛爲最劇烈，每致廢寢忘食，任何操作，皆不能支持。內子已生子女各一。每受孕一次，身體健康則逐漸退步，本年又受孕，頭痛依然如故，未審是何病症？是否與耳疾有關？抑或營養不良？應服何藥？</p>
<p>〔醫學博士余新恩答〕　懷孕而有頭痛等疾候，係爲姙娠毒血症，需檢騐血壓，眼底，小便等等，迨查明原由後，再依情診治。</p>
<p>（三）右腕麻木</p>
<p>嚴秋娟問　我在十九歲時，右手腕部及五指，發覺麻木。不痛不癢，惟無力取物，（如拿筷縫針等家常工作）起初限於經濟，未曾醫治。迄今十年。目下病狀仍舊，惟下臂較左臂稍細，手指及掌皮色同右，僅稍薄嫩。請問：（一）此爲何病？（二）能否治愈？（三）可有內服藥品自己購服？</p>
<p>〔醫學博士余新恩答〕　所患似係嬰兒灘瘓症。初起時可以電療，使肌肉不致衰變，今已相隔十年難望復原。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市商會爲新所得稅法，增加過劇，一般薪工階級，不堪負担，特電財政部云：接本市銀仃商業同業公會函稱：前准重慶市銀行公會函。略以新頒布修正所得稅法，規定　給報酬所得，自五萬元以上起征。其計算方法，以實際收入額爲所得額。竊以納稅固屬人民應盡義務，惟免征額過低，値此物價高漲，　給人員實際收入，爲照物價指數折合，實甚微薄。以之維持最低生活，尙感不敷，何堪再負担如此奇重之稅項。茲事關係全國各界，究應如何辦理，希貴會討論見復等由，准此。査薪給所得稅修正稅率，自五萬元以上起徵，其免稅額確屬過低。同時，每一從業員收入，超過二十四萬元者，每千元須課稅百元，並通薪給人員，月入三十萬元者不少，計其應繳所得稅額，即需一萬三千九百九十餘元。是在其本不敷生活之費用中，復從而扣去百分之五弱。無殊使一般確依薪給爲生者，少糧食米兩斗。故征收額在此幣値動盪物價步漲乏際，究應如何始臻合理，實有兼籌並顧必要。否則，所得稅爲良稅之一種，條文非不週密詳盡，而稅率之簽訂，却難週合實際。行則民生日　，止則國課有損。想各業同有此惑。貴會領導各業，對此集體性質之案件，當早爲慮及。爲此專函奉達，尙乞酌裁示復，以憑轉致等語到會。査年來幣値變遷太速太鉅，薪給報酬所得，如擬訂一固定之稅率，斷難適應各月之變遷狀態。目前在上海三十萬元之薪給，已難維持一家數口之家用。而按照現訂稅率扣繳薪給所得，須納稅至一萬三千九百九十元之鉅。在職工方面，自不免更形拮据。因此各業職工，已有籲請免稅之舉。如不酌于調整，在職工旣受重稅壓迫，惟有以不斷增資，爲補救之計。徒然助長工潮，增加社會亂源。査最近物價比例，如以關係重要漲價較遲之食米而論，約當戰前之六千餘倍。故目前工商從業員三十萬一月之薪給，約等於戰前之五十元。戰前第二類之薪給所得稅，未及三十元者免稅。自三十元至六十元，每十元課稅五分。五十元之薪給，僅負担所得稅一角五分。目前調整辦法，擬請酌照此項成例辦理，以底薪不滿三十元，乘每月之生活指數，爲所得稅免稅點。其超過免稅點之薪給，乘生活指數未超過戰前六十元之比例者，每十元課稅五分。庶標準校爲合理，而負担或能勉力。仰祈鈞部鑒核，採納施行，實爲公便。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紗廠聯合配銷委員會，昨日循例舉行會議，討論結果，計開售二十支棉紗標準數額民營各廠一八六九·五件，紡建一一七八，五件。售價以四百磅二十支爲標準，每件仍爲一百五十五萬元。</p>
<p>昨日紗市回跌甚巨，緣客胃已臻飽和，暫未添辦，而同行迫於銀根者‘，復相繼脫貨求現，晨初特雙馬二百二十六萬成交五件後，賣戶紛至查來，一瀉而下，最後收盤價爲二百十五萬，其餘二十支十六支亦跌十萬至十六萬，四十二支跌勢尤猛，較上日小三十萬左右。</p>
<p>原因價格過高，客銷頓寂，本街櫃銷，亦以價高難以出手，採辦甚稀，同業在此種狀態下，皆以銀根甚緊，急擬脫貨之故，旋以廣帮逢低價，小有吸收，後市細支紗綫行情，回升少許。</p>

<p>— 本報卅日香港航訊　特約記者凌芳</p>
<p>「……在表面上，香港復員得很快，但香港貿易與中國商務互爲因來，香港本身祇佔了一方面。香港完全恢復戰前世界大商港的地位，尙有待中國局勢的改進。」——「渣打銀行年報」。</p>
<p>英軍重入香港又是一年了。</p>
<p>這一年的過去，香港已由軍政時期轉入民政時期，由復員階段　進建設階段，現雖還有若干『不如理想』的地方，但秩序己代替了混亂，社會安定下來，百業漸次復興，使人增强了對朱來的信心，這是一年前誰也意料不到的事。　最近有不少國內人士，不辭跋涉跑來香港觀光，遠之如京滬，武漢，（有武漢記者團），近之如粤桂，（有廣州記者團），履足島上，耳濡目染，稱譽者多，指摘者少。英人統治殖民地，不愧是斷輪老手，祗可惜經過兩次大戰，千萬人的熬血。洗不淨他們陳腐的頭腦。香港這個小鳥依舊是過去百年來中英邦交汚點的記程碑，而不能作爲兩大民族互相曲諒，開誠相處的基石。這是我們所引爲扼腕的。</p>
<p>軍政府的措施</p>
<p>在過去十二個月中，香港經過了八個月的軍政管理，英人就利用了這個過渡時間，淸理日本人遺留的渣滓。在軍政時期中，舉凡「司法，立法，行政，種種權力責任，和全港人民財產管轄權，槪由香港英國海陸空軍總司令夏憨少將負責」，把香港千頭萬緒的政務通統置於軍政府直接控制之下，軍政府帶來了大批專家，有的甚至在香港淪落之日起，便開始埋頭計劃未來重返香港的，他們根據英殖民地部所批准的方案，藉着軍政府的無上權力，從事復興工作。</p>
<p>當米字英旗再度插上香港島時，軍政府便頒佈糧食和燃料的統制令，跟着大批救濟船隻把糧食運進來，民食問題吿了解決，不惟解決，那「一元五斤」的白米，還招考無數內地人民湧來香港，支持肅條約市面，作爲未來繁榮的有力因素。水電供應也在最短期內恢復；軍政府在這個時期中，力求保存地方上的元氣，雖有無限權力，但從不採取過激行動，挑起人民的反感。例如戰前是禁娼的，軍政期中公設妓院娼寮；戰前賣物的小飯必須領取營業牌照，軍政期中你來設攤我去擺擋，戰前脚踏車車尾和三輪車是不准搭人的，軍政期中，脚踏車與三輪車常作公共汽車，載客往來，（這些現象到了恢復民政後，已次第禁止），軍政府的措施大都集中於基本工作之上：（一）舉辦生死登記，（以計人口），（二）開設租務法庭，（以安民居），（三）取締沒有戰前登記的找換店和銀號，（以固金融），（四）限令學校，社團，報紙，收　機登記，（五）執行中國籍以外的限制移民條例，（以維治安），（六）恢復交通，（以利民生），……其中尤以恢復交通一項，最賣氣力。</p>
<p>日軍投降前夕，香港港外佈滿水雷，珠江河口亦多浮雷，香港與廣州澳門的永面交通，事實上已吿停頓，當時祗有少數機帆冒險行駛，行旅視爲畏途。及至海珠汽輪在虎門外觸雷沉沒，溺斃十餘人的慘劇發生後，人們對海上浮雷，談虎色變，陸路方面，廣九鐵路到了十一月中旬，全錢修復通車，那時英海軍掃雷隊還未完成工作。今年初，英海軍又替我方淸除珠江口的水雷，香港對粤省內河的交通，遂得暢行無阻。</p>
<p>香港九龍交通方面，軍政府接管了渡輪公司，和公共汽車公司，使用殘餘的船隻，車輛，維持各地交通，頗收成效，除公共汽車漲價一倍外，渡輪還照戰前收費，這與糧食統制二者，堪爲英人最有戰力的措施。</p>
<p>五月一日，香港正式恢復民政。若說軍政府的措施是在混亂中求安定，則民政的措施便是從安定中求進步了。因此，軍政時間的「容忍」，到了這時已不復存在，港督楊慕琦宣誓就職後，跟着委出行政局和立法局的委員，恢復行政會議和立法會議。重奠「法治」的基礎，倫教派來的專家，包括政務的與技術的，絡繹抵港。他們每個人身上，幾乎是代表着每一個香港常前的問題。他們組織了種種色色的委員會，如復興計劃委員會，房屋建設委員會，擴充港口委員會，研究租務法例委員會，勞工仲裁委員會，以至汽車左駛硏究委員會。……都是縝密地檢討問題，具體地提出方案，決定了就做，絕非紙上空談，自欺欺人，聊以塞責，與官僚政風，逈然不同。　因爲恢復法治，戰前通過的法案業已陸續恢復執行，爲了調整工商供應與促進經濟繁榮，港府繼米糧統制條例後，頒佈「一九四六年物價統制條例」，不久又頒佈　用物資，（包括屋宇飛機車輛），入口貨物領照，疋頭統制？……等法條，（詳見八月九日「香港工業的躍動」一稿），計劃控制整個市塲，强迫商人從投機的路上轉回正常業務、「貿易數字，大量增加，象微香港未來的佳景，居民可完全信賴穩定及有價値的通貨」。——七月十二日匯豐銀行總經理摩斯報吿。</p>
<p>香港通貨的穩定，確是促進香港繁榮主要條件之一。港府釐定一個匯率，（港幣一元値英鎊一先令兩便士又四分之一），使港元與英鎊發生直接聯系，不特避免遭受中國法幣波動的影響，抑吸進了中國富豪大量的資金，作爲建設香港的新血輸，中國戰後新興的資本恰如昔日軍閥大地主的財富一樣，替港九的山谷或海濱，建立一幢一幢的西式房子或大工廠。</p>
<p>記者在過去的通訊中，曾指出香港工資的低廉對香港工業復興的裨益。港府不惜費盡心機制止物價刺激工資上漲，幷與資方會商一個工資定額，由各大工廠一致遵行。自民政恢復以來，香港工潮迭起，尤以電燈公司與渡海小輪公司兩次罷工，最爲嚴重。但結果工人亦無法完全達到他們的要求，因此，香港的工廠陸續復工，上海工廠亦有遷港之說，（上海外商工廠戰後轉在香港登記的已有一百一十七家）。說到這裏，我們且回顧一下這一年來我國派駐香港各機關的工作。試從接收方面說起：我們不司忘記，當日夏　少將是奉了中國戰區最高統帥委員長之命，率領英艦隊重入香港接受當地日軍投降，我軍事代表團也隨着英艦隊進入香港，我們接收所得，除了日軍殘餘武器和港中幾十艘破船外，別無什麽了，不足與京滬的「接收」作比，但日本人遺留的東西不可算少，不說別的，中環海傍的大阪碼頭，現在却變爲「渣旬碼頭」了，駐港軍事代表團凡三度易長，接收工作的難使人滿意。殆可想見。</p>
<p>英軍重入香港的初期，實力單薄，曾請求我方協助維持秩序，我憲兵隊便在日本投降後重踏上己喪失百年以前故土。其後西南國軍奉命北調，大批過港，並租用九龍塘北區的民房作臨時兵營，僑胞朝夕目覩全副武裝國軍的雄姿，（戰前港府長禁止武裝國軍入境的），甚爲興奮，八月十五日，駐九龍塘兵營的國軍，奉命開返深圳，我駐港軍事代表團，廣州行營駐港辦事處等機關亦宣佈結束。國軍忽然離港，曾引起多方忖測，有謂港府鑒於中國內爭據大，爲保守絕對中立起見，不欲再予國軍過境的方便；而另據可靠方面稱：國軍經港北上，事前與英方訂有簽定，規定至本年八月十五日期滿，國軍爲遵守信用，故於期滿後開返國境云云我政府爲官　在日人鐵蹄下三年零八個月的僑民，日本投降後，即撥匯國幣四千萬元來港辦理教濟工作，又登記僑民戰時損失，（包括軍票問題），代向日方索取賠償，最近復舉辦美金貸款，協助僑民工業復興，外交部兩廣特派員公署駐港辦事處，已於去年十二月正式成立，對僑民利益的保障不無小補，但似仍有加强工作的必要。</p>
<p>這一年間，我駐港機關與港府發生不愉快的事件，至少有兩宗，曾造成相當緊張的局面：一宗是國軍容少尉被蔔　毆辱的屈土文案，一宗是國民日報被封事件，尤以後者　動全楓，當日本報已有詳細報道，茲不另賽·實奸也是一個中英雙方屢經交涉而無妥善結果的懸案。戰後香港問題已成爲中英邦交的一個決定因素，希望舉　一致作政府的後盾，使能獲得最合理的解決。</p>
<p>現在，除了「延期付款法令」又名「中止法案」尙未撤銷外，香港經過一年來復員的努力，大體上可說已復常態。因受延期付款法案所凍結的戰前資金，單是匯　銀行一家，已逾五千萬元，港府爲了控制游資，遲遲不願撤銷這個法令。這對於港中金融的流動，貿易的發展，和工業的繁茂，不無相當的影響，但因戰時的債權與債券的關係，一時未獲適當解決，該法令也無法提前撤消，該法令旣未撤消，香港中西各大公司大企業的股份，亦不能正式公開交易。戰前各大公司大企業的股份，總値九八一，二七二四七一元，據一般估計，現當漲至十五萬萬元以上；撤銷延期付款法令，匯　銀行總理摩斯，曾呼籲於前，立法局議員亦討論於後，八月底，港府己接納立法局通過撤消該法案的提案，仍須待英廷批准，才能宣佈撤銷，但爲期恐亦不遠。</p>
<p>港督就任之始，曾宣佈今後十一個月內，港府經費預算支出七千五百萬元，而稅收不及四千萬元。港府爲彌補計，考慮徵收戰稅。七月中旬，財政司提出一九四六年度財政預算，（至一九四七年三月卅一日爲止），計達一六〇，一五一，六六五元，一全港人口一百二十萬人計，平均每人担負一百二十元以上。外傳港府自十月起，將以太平洋和約還未簽訂爲辭，繼續徵收四種戰稅，包括所得稅，過分科得稅等，倘眞屬實，居民届時能否「吃得消」，可覘香港繁榮的程度了。</p>
<h3 id="c158">獄中探巨奸 <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— 九月卅日南京訊　楊雁冰</p>
<p>周佛海說：「寫寫自白書，看看小說，獄中生活無所謂。」</p>
<p>丁默邨說：「把我們解到東，又解到西，還談什麽優待！」</p>
<p>去年八月，日本宣佈無條件投降以後，僞國民政府一羣要員，都驚慌得手忙脚亂，不知用甚麽方法來應付這突變的局面。因此，接收大員還沒有到，羣魔都東奔西逃了，惟有周逆佛海，丁逆默邨等居然還接到中央的任用，命周佛海爲軍委會上海行動隊　指揮，任援道爲先遣軍總司令，當時許多人說，這是一個奇蹟。嗣後捕奸工作積極展開，大小漢奸先後落網，惟有周逆等却解往重慶去，時隔一年，始於本月十六日用專機解到南京，在許多人心目中，又是一個奇慶。</p>
<p>廿三日下午三時，周逆佛海，丁逆默邨，羅逆君强，馬逆驥良，楊逆惺華等五『奸貴』，從寗海路十九號移到老處橋首都地院看守所，記者以某種關係，始准到獄作第二次探望。</p>
<p>他們關在幾個不同字號的監舍裏，周逆丁逆和羅逆在忠字四號，爲逆在三號，楊逆在六號房間，空氣光綫倒還充足，每天尙有二小厮日間司洒掃侍應等職，所以弄得相當整齊，只是帶來的看護廚師用人等都被遺去，不能獨享特殊的待遇，但國法對他們畢竟還是寬大。</p>
<p>當記者走到監舍門口時，周逆越坐在床上，紅光滿面，但精神稍見萎糜，抬頭看見了記者，他竟站起來，記者便問周逆獄中生活過得慣吾？他說無所謂，寫寫自白書，看看小說，一天很快過去了，於是記者再問：</p>
<p>「戴笠將軍的死對你倒是一個損失吧？」</p>
<p>周逮默默地回答：「我卅二年一月起就與中央發生關係，來掩護地下工作同志，勝利後維持江南地方治安，滬事只有戴將軍最淸楚。……</p>
<p>「那末卅二年以前呢？」記者不耐煩的打斷了周逆的話，他却啞然無言了。</p>
<p>馬逆和羅逆正在談話，見記者站在門口，也就停止了話頭。馬逆回過頭去，似乎不願讓記者看他的面孔，丁逆却自動的走過來加入談話。</p>
<p>談到重慶的生活，丁逆說：「有人以爲我們解重慶是特別優待，否則爲什慶不解別個，你想把我們解到東解封西，生活這樣不自由，還談什麼優待？」</p>
<p>「今天上午，高院又傳訊過一次，是嗎？」</p>
<p>「已經好幾次了。」周逆說：「關於過去的一切，都寫在自白書裏，是非功罪，自有公論，看他們那種心安理得的樣子，與陳逆公博至死不悟，着實可算是「異曲同工」。</p>
<p>因爲是在午飯後可以稍事自由活動的時間內，林逆柏生也從忠字舍走出來，過去林逆與周逆素不相容，所以今天一眼看見周逆便退回去了，周逆也帶着厭的口氣惡狠狠的說：「這個怪東西，每天晚上總是號啕大哭，弄得我們睡不着，不知幹什麽的？」</p>
<p>「聽說爲了法院已經判處死刑，大槪是怕死吧！」記者無形中給屬逆一個强烈的刺激，言外餘香，周逆默然無語。記者也便怱怱的退出來了。</p>
<p>記者心中想：周逆等的生死，操在最高當局手裏。縱然在卅二年一月起與中央發生關係，掩護地下工作同志，勝利後維持江南治安，使國軍得以順利接收，但總不能抵償叛國的滔天大罪吧！國人所注視的，自然是審奸當局對他們的處理問題。</p>

<p>— 十一日桂林航訊　特約記者梁小中</p>
<p>新穀像潮水一樣登塲，米價悽慘地跌了又跌，七萬，六萬，四萬，三萬，二萬七一担，米價跌得熱閙，公敎人員加薪也加得熱閙，一個月的錢普通可買五百至一千斤白米，眞是花得來。然而省級的公務員却未必便能如願以償，省府口口聲聲是「財政支絀」，看情形又要七折八扣。况且米平，別的東西却並未低首，一斤豬肉的價錢，十倍於一斤米，由此而可推及其他了。</p>
<p>霍亂在桂林撒下了一張黑綱半個月間患者達千人之多。貧乏得可憐的醫院，因爲沒有檢騐的器械，不敢確定它就是霍亂而稱之曰「類似霍亂，」而這一塲「類似霍亂，」到今天止，已經使棺材店的老板笑到眼都睜不開來，多少「類似霍亂」而死的人爲了沒有棺材，便包在一張「類似棺材」的蓆子裏抬出郊外去，醫院的急救成了一套具文，爲了藥品的缺乏，十個有六個病人是一進去便永遠不會再行着出來。甚至醫院拒收病人變了一件平常的事，報紙上一駡，第二夭便是一通「來函更正，」（一次更正便已經死了一個人。）這就是醫生的道德。</p>
<p>有一件比霍亂更駭人的新聞，原來共產黨看中了靈川，修仁等縣交界的傜山區，一批批的運軍火到裏面，準備及時而動，可惜事機不密，却在靈川縣被抄了一個滿堂紅，說起來眞有點替共產黨掃興。我敢說一句：共產黨在廣西絕對不是「無動於中」，尤其是搖旗吶喊的尾巴，可謂是苟日新，又日新。我不知道怎樣寫才算是中立的話，然而我相信，大衆的愛憎，也就是我個人的愛憎，要我更客觀地說一句，我便會吿訴你：「廣西人沒有一個不恨共產黨」。</p>
<p>擅殺縣長的倪仲濤專員公堂受審，事前奔走有方，辯護時侃侃而道，卒在方圓鼎力之下，輕輕的判了十一年徒刑。十一年的時間，並不算長，倪專員在等候着大赦，或者是「小赦」。</p>

<h3 id="c161">地圖的審查 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— 危言</p>
<p>中國的教育是不大注意地理的，例如說，學校裏面所謂主要課程是國算英等，至於地理歷史假使不及格，那是不妨碍升級的。所以在中國青年腦子裏國家的地域觀念是很淡薄。過去敵人拿去了我們的東北，以至於華北，在我們南方人的心目中並沒有感覺到嚴重，也根本不知道在地理上這些地方的重要。我們對於地理的知識太疏忽了。</p>
<p>再看看過去日本人對於地理的研究是多麼的重視。據說在日本可以找到一家書店是專門發售中國地圖的。在京滬淪陷期間敵人對於教育方面的工作第一件事便是改換地理教科書，沒收書店和各圖書館的地圖。就在這個慘痛的對照之下，我們自己頗覺雖已勝利，仍感慚愧。</p>
<p>最近報載上海世界與地學社出版「世界新形勢地圖」，其中內容誤謬百出，如台灣與朝鮮，仍認爲日本領土，并誤將葱嶺以西，至江心坡一帶之重要的地區，劃入他國境內。這荒謬已使政府不能容忍。這不是荒唐到了極點嗎？假使連這一點常識都沒有，那還配編製地圖？這也足見我國素日對於地理忽視之一斑。</p>
<p>內政部已重行修正「水陸地圖審查條例」，規定凡地圖非經審查認可，不得注册發行。這是消極的辦法。我們主張國立編譯館應會同國防部內政部組織一水陸地圖編製委員會，延聘著名地理專家編製最新地圖及地理教科書，而教育部課程標準內應規定地理不及格者不得升級或畢業，使國人重視地理的教學。</p>
<h3 id="c162">民治新論 <a href="#c162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— 胡浩然</p>
<p>土贛愚者　大東書局印行</p>
<p>自第二次世界大戰法西斯失敗，久遭白眼之民主政治，又風靡一時；無論左右兩方面都是把民主呌得霹天價　。但是第一次却英美法幾個老民主國，其乘之而起的，不是以極端國家主義相標榜的納粹或法西斯，便是以階級鬥爭爲號召的共產主義。現在國際局勢杌隉不定，更甚於第一次大戰結束之初，縱令納粹或法西斯派，一時不會捲土重來，而極權主義所推行的民主，是不是真比英國的民主進步，是不是應取英美式的民主而代之，確是一個值得檢討的問題，這本　便是供給我們檢討這個問題的，一種很好考證。</p>
<p>民治精神</p>
<p>這書首講「民治的倫理」，自第一章至第三章剖析自由平等權利與義務等觀念，證示「民治自始即有道德的內容，有高尚的鵠的。」第四章力言，「培養政風」底重要，說「實行民治的根本問題，就是如何行政權更替使有常規可循。……欲使政治健全化，除建立制度以外，尤須力求得人，力求得人以外，又不得不培養良好的政風。」因而指出「尚公」「公允」「坦直」「寬容」四點爲培養政風的主要條件。第五章提示「理想公民的精神，就是基乎「公務觀念的發揮。」最近司徒大使曾對記者說：「民主是世界最好的制度，若不負責任，也是世界最壞的制度。」也就是警告我們，趕快培養「服公務的觀念。」</p>
<p>其次「從現實看民治」分做五章看。第六章討論民主國與獨裁之差別，及獨裁政治發生之原因後，提出民主國預防獨裁侵擊的一種建議說：「祇有一面增大政府應付經濟危機的權限，一面又酌量增加這種權限以相當限制，必須權限與責任均有合理的規定，然後得使政治永遠保持其均衡。」可是怎樣增大政府的權限。怎樣增加這種權限以相當限制？這是一種徹底調整或改造民主國家整個機構的重大工作，它却沒有提出具體方案，讓人類智慧去研究。本來政制往往因國情的不同而大異其趣，不可一槪而論。孫中山先生吁衡世界大勢，觀察我們歷史社會背境，主張人民要有權，政府要有能的「權能分開」說，並擬就五權憲法，與國民大會的具體方案，或許就是人類智慧底最大貢獻，值得考量。</p>
<p>言論自由</p>
<p>第七章辦證言論自由關係民治之重要，駁斥反對言論自由者之不當，並主張切實給少數人以言論自由。他說：「一國政治的生命，大部份寄託於優秀的少數人。他們的政異的行爲，和獨特的見解，常常變爲政治措施的反映。保持政治上的均衡，決不是取締或抑壓少數人，而是寬容或保障少數人。」這話不但是民主國主政者底當頭棒喝，也是一般「主權的人民」底座右銘。不但保持政治上的均衡應如此，要使政權的更替不流血革命，也非如此不可。少數人能切實言論自由，少數黨纔可望變爲多數黨；政權根據民意而更迭之理論，纔可和平實現。否則在少數服從多數之民主制度下，少數黨將永無變爲多數黨之希望，勢必變成武力革命而後已。第八章討論「戰時議會制度」應否尊重，它底結論是主張尊重的。又第九章討論「民主國的外交」，它主張打破秘密外交，把它置在政黨督察之下。這兩點就民主原則而論，自屬當然。伹從經騐上看，兵貴神速，戰時人的問題總比法的問題更重要。如得其人，則如英國巴力門在第二次大戰設立國家支出審核委員會來監督政府底軍事行動也好，就如第一次大戰時英國會對於喬治內閣，美國會對於威爾遜總統，全不加以控制，也未見得有什麼大　，有時或反覺得有迅赴戎機的便利。至於外交與軍事有連帶關係，也要看人說話。在國際戰爭未能消滅的今日，想消滅秘密外交，談何容易；就是提倡民主最力的羅斯福，也不免要落舊式外交底窠臼。雅爾達會議關於中國主權的三強協定，到戰後半年纔宣佈，便是一個顯例，他人更不足道了。我們認爲要完全實現這種公開外交的理想，非先設法實現世界和平廢除戰爭不可。</p>
<p>免於戰爭</p>
<p>第十章討論「民主理想與和平」，說明民主關係和平之重要後，進而考究國際何以尚不能實現和平的主因。認爲（一）因在經濟不平等情况之下，「有」國與「無」國之間，態度根本旣不相同，又無共同理想，彼此當然不會爲和平而協作。（二）因民主國底「個人自由主義」，應用到國際上去，對主權不肯受絲毫的限制，如此而促成任何國際組織，縱然暫時產生，終久沒不夭折的。這確是洞見癥結的名言。但我們還想補充一點；民主制度裏面底「制衡」觀念，也要算是造成現今國際局勢的一種因素。因爲此種觀念，導源於相疑互忌，而分權以互相牽制；在國內有法治精神來維擊猶可相安無事。運用到國際方面，便演爲「均勢」政策；沒有法治精神來維擊，全靠軍事政治的均勢來支持。均勢局面一破裂，戰爭即隨之而起。第一和第二次大戰的經過，都可拿來做註脚。至於說：「國際之失敗，由於英法無決心，乏勇氣，勉強避免戰爭，不惜對德日義等國牘武者，屈膝退讓，」那猶是皮毛的看法，並與事實不相符。其實英法內部先在那裏鬥法寶，弄均勢，弄到均勢之局不能維持的時候，退讓固不行，就取強硬態度也未見得有效。要曉得西洋人是向來喜歡逞強蠻幹，不肯示弱的。現在美國是鑒於上次英法對軸心軟弱的覆轍，大改作風，想拿堅強政策防備蘇聯擴張了。可是還有人在那裏大聲疾呼，說這樣弄下去，怕會促成第三次大戰呢？</p>
<p>免於飢餓</p>
<p>再次講「民治的經濟觀。」有些地方大槪接受了馬克斯主義修正派底理論。在第十一章討論資產階級與民治；在第十二章討論自由與經濟制度，把資本主義與馬克斯主義詳細比較之後，斷定資本主義旣不足以保證大衆生活安定，使民治暢行；伹亦決非援用階級鬥爭所可完成的。</p>
<p>說到這裏，我認爲由這次大戰發展出來的「自由主義底計劃經濟，」和現在英國工黨內閣所推行的一種社會主義，確很可供我們參考。那麼王先生所說「民治國家勉強實施計劃經濟，最少是暫時放棄責任政府的精神。」及「獨裁政治的傾向，也就是採用社會主義的方法，以開闢極度　權的途徑。」又不免似乎杞人憂天了。然而這惟有民治　養深厚的英美，說　似乎不難，若在他國，資產階級旣到手的權利，是不是肯輕易放手呢？恐怕是個大大疑問？最好，是像我國在資本主義和社會主義尚未形成的時候，勵行孫中山先生的「民生主義」；一面增加生產，一面於增加生產隊過程中，預防分配的不均。切　執政諸公，不要鍇過了這個機會。第十二章解釋今日馬克斯主義所以式徼的原故，深切著明；可使那班崇拜馬氏的人們發一深省。</p>

<p>詹氏的「心理學原理」的出版，距今雖已歷相當時期，然而它在學術界的地位並不因它非新著而减損，時間不能消滅一本偉大的著作的生命，所以中國哲學會西洋哲學名著編譯委員會把詹氏的名著選譯而編成叢刋。除去「論思想流」以外，還有「論習慣」「論情緒」「論自我意識」及「論意志」等單行本，將次第出版。</p>
<p>這本薄薄八十餘頁的小册子，到可以從裏面尋出著者對於心理學一個獨特的思想體系，他研究心理學係由生理學和解剖學下手，打破從來心理學空談「意識」而涉玄妙的傳統觀念，奠定心理學的生理研究的基礎。他特別思想作用對一個人心理的影響，又由哲學上給心理學提供有力的論據。他說最基本的心理事實便是有一種思想作用在進行着，人們的思想作用支配着他們的心理活動。</p>
<p>在「論思想流」中，著者闡明思想的五種特性。每個人的思想就循着這五種特性而進行。他所說的五種思想特性槪括：（一）每個思想都具有成爲一部分個人意識的趨勢。（二）在每個人的意識之內，思想永遠是變化的。（三）在每個人的意識之內，思想覺得是連續的。（四）人類思想顯似，是應付獨立於思想之外的對象的。（五）思想對這些對象之中的有些部份具有興趣，對其餘部份不理會，並時時刻刻加以接受或加以排棄——在這些對象中加以選擇。</p>
<p>從第一種特性中，闡明思想不是完全各自獨立的，亦非通統聯成一氣。思想自然不是孤立的，每個思想都和有些別的思想在一起，和此外的思想完全分離。我們所研究的意識狀態，只是從各個具體的特殊的我和你裏才能見到。每個思想旣有成爲個人所有的趨勢，那麼我們就得把握住思想的發展。</p>
<p>詹氏所論的第二種特性，認爲思想是不斷變化的。我們的意識狀態時時在變化，沒有一個意識狀態，一經過去再能重現。我們一會在聽，一會在看，一會在推理，一會在追憶，一會在愛，一會在恨。科學的目的是把複雜化爲簡單。心理學上的「觀念說」（Theory　of　idea）即由彼此不相同的某些簡單不變的意識元素配合而成。著者認爲我們對於一件事實的每一思想總是獨一無二的，它與我們對於同一件事實的其他思想，只有在種類上的相似。遇着同一事實再現時，我們一定要按着新樣子想它，從多少不同的觀點看它。</p>
<p>著者又在思想的第三個特性中，說明每個人的思想總感覺是有連續性的。即使思想有時間上的斷絕，但斷絕後的意識總感到與斷絕前的意識是連成一氣的。</p>
<p>從思想的連續性和統一性，詹氏更開發他的思想第四特性：人類思想是應付獨立於思想之外的對象。換言之，思想含有認識作用。我們所以相信我們思想的對象有個居心外的複本存在，由於世上有多個的人類思想，個個都具有相同的對象。對於「我的思想跟他的思想有同一對象」這個判斷，即是心理學者所以認爲我們的思想知道了一個外界實物的理由。</p>
<p>在第五種特性中，詹氏更進一步說明意識的選擇作用。意識總是對它的對象的一部份比對其他部份更關切，而且意識在它思想的全部時間，往往接受一部份而拒絕其他部份。揀剔的注意作用和審慮的意志作用，便是思想選擇活動的明例。我們的所有知覺都有抑揚和輕重作用，詹氏又討論到道德觀念，他認爲思想的選擇作用高於一切，如果一種行爲不是從幾種同樣可能行爲中選擇而實踐，那麼這種行爲就沒有道德價值。</p>
<p>綜觀詹氏所論的思想特性，確爲哲學史及心理學史上一篇重要的文獻。爲了要確認具體的經騐在心理學上的地位，他以生理和哲學的觀點抨擊當時以分析的結果（如感覺）爲唯一心理的實在的傳統見解。他旣反對感覺主義，以爲人的意識狀態只有感官印象；也反對理智主義，以爲這些印象必須有比它們自身高得許多級的純粹理智作用使之綜合才有統一性。他堅持他的主張：每個人的思想是連續的，是個不斷的流。思想的統一性和綜合性，給詹氏剖析得詳盡，這可說是對心理學界的一大革命。</p>
<h3 id="c164">讀「砂丁」 <a href="#c164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— 汪放</p>
<p>這本薄薄的書——「砂丁」，是巴金先生作的。我讀了以後，並沒有慰安，而祇增加一些感慨，也許，那就是我的慰安！</p>
<p>書中主角升義哥，他便是被鄙視爲砂丁之一，他纔廿來歲的年輕小伙子，他確是爲了自身的生活和前途，信上張先生那一套鑛裏有辦法「一年至少也有三五百塊錢的工錢」，而離開了他所不想離開的家和銀姐。姐銀，是他的未婚妻，是一個慈心溫善的女　子，她起初總不放心他去，挖錫塊，在地底下爬來爬去，不見天日，尤其怕他的眼睛瞎了。然而，升義此刻正一心一意想着雪亮的銀洋錢，那麼多，那麼響得清脆好聽，他總以爲銀姐的活是出於過分的愛，太顧慮了，因爲他已深信四十來歲八字鬚子的張生先（鑛裏的同事）是一個好人，不會騙他。他還計劃着：做兩年工，也不過七百幾十天，很快地就可以過了，可以拿到千把塊錢或鑛底下他所意想的金銀財寶回來安頓他的家。在升義本身，當然是一貫的這一種直覺的想法。</p>
<p>然而，銀姐總猶豫，思念「兩年以內會看不見這年青美麗的面孔，聽不見這溫柔的清脆的聲音，一個人到那不熟習的地方去做不熟習的工作，留下她孤零零的在公館裏受苦，沒有點安慰！安慰！也許這其間發生什麼事變，甚至把他的全盤計劃打碎」因而不放心，幾乎好幾天哭泣到不讓他去。終於被千方百計的升義一個積極的思想和「兩年是很短，並不長久，很易過去」的一節話說動了他的心，而祇好讓他去了。</p>
<p>升義，終於在一天早晨，跟一羣同伴走了。走進了懸崖峭壁陰氣沉沉的山谷，所謂「死城」，就在這裏面。終天在深山僻塢裏紆廻行走。當然是很苦。他們同行的老張，小王，吳洪發，都在趙二祖宗廟下叩過響頭，要求這位開鑛祖師給他們以保佑和照護。一天兩天的走去，在一個下午到了目的地——採鑛區，可是他們所經過的地方，連小孩都脾腉他們，嘰里咕嚕地爭嚷着，又新來了一批「砂丁」。這句話倒使他們聽不慣很生起氣來，因爲他們看出那些野孩子，一副輕佻相，當然不會是善意的。因而便鑄下他們第一個惡印象。疲勞，飢餓，催促他們，於是被送到一間大屋子，不十分亮，陰森森地，他們在地上休息了一會，便蹲在地上吃飯。</p>
<p>工作開始了，不問天雨天晴，自朝至暮，一天又一天的工作下去，他們沒有清閒，沒有娛樂，他們夜晚，祇有上賭塲，找求一絲生趣，賭塲。終歸是個化錢鬧事的地方，同伴中的小王便在賭塲上被流彈打死了。但這回事，小王死了，是他們一　而散逃出賭塲以後才發覺的。等到想去尋他，又被那尖頭陰險的三角臉鑛　阻止住了。他說：「怕他沒有人收埋嗎？」他們這一羣苦難朋友，從此，又受到另一種更深刻的不可思議的威脅。</p>
<p>烏黝黝的地下工作，煤氣燈點着，坑裏泛潮着，這一來，鑛裏除了陰氣和鑛砂裏發散出的氣味外，別想有好感覺。苦日子果然到來，死的死了，被毆的傷了。然而除了一死才得了結之外，你別想休息或高興片刻。時間越長，日子越苦，被鄙視爲砂丁的，他們也過得更煩悶。想到自己對於家的絕望，更感到沒有意思。升義更思念起可愛的銀姐來，終於對「生」會由不感興趣而消極下去，覺得死已漸漸逼近。正如原作中寫的：「因爲，任何時候，每個砂丁，都被那陰影壓迫著，那陰影就像鬼一般抓住他們的靈魂」。</p>
<p>黑影漸漸　攏來，生活也漸漸變了。吃的不好，睡的不好，工作起來越苦。滂沱大雨終於到來落得鑛坑像湖澤，水牢。烏漆漆的水越來越深，越來越大。他們也跟着丟開他們最厭憎沉重的鑛鋤，向鑛口逃命。這固然是求之不得的一個出走機會，但究竟在洪流滔中冒險尋着生路。</p>
<p>各人都拆命泅水前進，他們的中途同伴——癩頭和尚固然有一股傻勁爬出了深淵。老張抵不住水力，被激流碎石幾個滾冲沒了。接上幾陣水聲一來；連哀哀呌喚銀姐的升義也不見了。可憐他，也可憐他的同伴，更可憐他們倆的心願便永遠幻滅在這磨難中。銀姐是不到一年便受了繁重的勞務和寂寞的摧殘老早折磨死了！</p>

<h3 id="c165">性格的創造 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— 王平陵</p>
<p>憧憬於古代歷史的事跡，想像製造那些事跡的歷史人物，隨便抓出一位來，描摹他是紅面還是白面，說話的聲音，像女人或像貓叫，愛着什麼衣服，有沒有鬚子，像這種手法，不過憑自己的幻想，畫出人物的輪廓，並不算是創造人物的性格。</p>
<p>人物的性格，雖不外乎下列的幾種：快樂，憂鬰，堅決，猶豫，訓果，脆弱，真實，虛偽，仁慈，殘酷，寬大，偏窄……等等相對的方面；無寗說是被後天的感受性所形塑，用明顯的話語來解答，就是，人類爲要爭取存在，不能不具備若干條件，使能密切適應現實的環境，在洶湧澎湃的生活浪潮中，尋覓生活的資源。因此，人物的性格，常不免感受生活激流的衝盪，或在時代的镕爐中再鍜鍊而逐漸變質，失去原來的本真，譬如，一個熟悉的朋友，自甲地移居乙地，隔幾年再會，他的聲音笑貌，也許依然故我，然你在稍經週旋之後，定能感覺到他的性格完全變了，這便是爲了生活，不得不使自己的性格，更適應於現實的要求。基於此義，作家們要在作品中創造真實的性格，使讀者不覺得人物的生疏與隔膜，而都是栩栩欲活，有血，有肉，有靈魂，那麼，你就得認識時代，體騐人生，澈底瞭解與生活有關的一切，時時刻刻游泳於現實的苦海。</p>
<p>要從古代的歷史中創造人物的性格，並非不可能；但必須搜集可靠的史實，意味，到那時代的精神，體騐那時代的生活和習慣，深切研究所要創造的人物在那時代所發生的影響；才能使表現的人物，不是泥塑木雕的神，而也是有血有肉的人。像太史公的描寫項羽，羅貫中的刻劃關公，施耐庵的襯托宋江，非常真切近情，絕沒有「神化」的　點。就因爲他們能够神與古會，探得歷史的現實。</p>
<p>作家們如果缺乏正確的哲學觀點，作爲認識時代，體騐人生的天秤，如果不能運用想象，觀察，分析，綜合等等的方法，根求事實的真相，那麼，你就是描寫今天發生的事實，也未必能把握現實；就是把自己當作刻劃的對象，同像是虛無漂渺，決不能接近真實的。</p>
<p>創造人物的性格，因爲作家的觀點不同，處理的方法，也就不一樣。例如：有些好作翻案文章的歷史家，都說岳飛是好戰份子，而主和的秦檜，倒是宋室的忠臣；郭沫若在近作「屈原」這一個劇本中，把風流倜儻的宋玉，描寫得像一個小丑，一個卑鄙無恥的弄臣。由於作家們的觀點不同，往往把描寫的人物，近於標新立異，完全越出了常軌。至於是否合理，那是批評家的責任。</p>
<p>作家們的責職，在明是非，辦虛偽，追求光明，指示真理，對於人物性格的創造，完全是基於正確的認識，根據故事的發展，絕不滲入個人的成見和偏見。可是，一經定型，則作家們應該站在客觀的立塲，對黑暗面的人物，必須加以仇視，咀咒，毫不留情地打擊；對於光明的人物，更應該盡力表揚嘉許，無微不至地歌頌。這樣，才可以使描寫的人物，活在紙面上，在讀者的心目中獲得深切的共鳴與反響。</p>
<h3 id="c166">離別 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— 謝紫</p>
<p>「明知這分別是不可免的，還是把眼淚變成微笑吧」！雖然這樣說着，她的眼睛裏還是閃爍着晶瑩的淚珠。不錯，與其流淚，還是微笑的好；生離死別原是椿痛苦的事，可是用微笑來送別，這裏面含有更深的回味和不得已。</p>
<p>這是幾年以前的事了，記憶已經給時間冲淡，而這依法惜別的微笑，還那樣的使人神往。</p>
<p>在人生的過程中，差不多每一步是一個離別，不管是暫時的睽隔，還是永久的分離。我們每天要碰到許多不相識的人。這些人，或許只有一面之緣，或許會再度相見，即使相見，也已記憶不清了。有時候我們碰到一個美麗的女孩子，我們爲她的美麗所吸引，不住的向她窺視，在她的眼睛裏也可以看到一種朦朧的惜別之情；是的，在這無限綿邈的時間和無限廣闊的空間裏，偶然會合，不能不說是一種機緣。只是這偶然的機緣，一轉眼就消然消逝了，想要捕捉，却也無從捕捉。在我們的生命中，有着無數這一類的分別——沈默的，沒有眼淚的，在來日朦朧的記憶中，有時候會引起懊悔的，可是爲什麼懊悔呢？爲什麼懊悔呢？</p>
<p>人生是由各種不同的滋味複合而成的苦味，正像是各種不同的顏色複合而成的黑色。可是假如我們仔細去尋味，我們還可以在這黑色中，看到各種不同顏色的渣滓——玷污了的紅色，　暗了的綠色·零亂了的紫色，而生離死別，則像是在深深的灰色上，閃爍着深紅色的星。</p>
<p>這星光代表着一種希望，一種夢想——離別的人也許會重逢，死去的人，也許會在另外一個世界裏重聚。這世間的一切，原是不可知的，在這不可知中，有着無限的痛苦，說不定也有一點意外的歡樂；到了真正重逢或重聚的時候，這些深紅色的星，會互相衝擊，互相眩耀，彷彿是黑夜中的燄火，照亮了人生背面的真實。</p>
<p>在平日親友相聚的時候，我最怕旁人提起離別，而我自己，却又不知不覺的喜歡提起它；這時候，離別的情緒，每個人心裏都已朦朧的意識到，只要有一個人提起來，就彷彿一支短笛的聲音，逐漸的喚醒了那些沈默的小提琴，喚醒了那些低音大提琴，又喚醒了鍽鼓和鋼琴，而演成了一支生離死別的大合奏。</p>
<p>假如我們用探索的眼光去觀察人生，就可以看到許多神秘而不可解的事；而生離死別更是神秘中的神秘者。它究竟是受着人們意慾的支配呢？還是受着定數的支配？它永遠站在我們生活的圈子裏，把那些散漫的日子，穿成了連續的，有系統的一串——一串神秘的真珠，一串晶瑩的淚珠，要透過這晶瑩的淚珠，去尋覓那依依惜別的微笑，幾乎是使人心痛的。</p>

<p>— 凡爾哈倫著　大椿譯</p>
<p>風車在夜的深處慢慢地慢慢地轉動，</p>
<p>背後襯出一個憂鬰而愁悶的天空。</p>
<p>他轉着復轉着，他底赤紫的布帆，</p>
<p>有無限的憂鬰，衰弱，重滯和倦怠。</p>
<p>黎明後，他底臂膊伸着似在乞憐，</p>
<p>一會兒伸起，一會兒放下。</p>
<p>現在又在那邊，灰暗的空間，</p>
<p>和似死的大自然底沉洫裏沉落。</p>
<p>在若干村落上睡着一個病態的冬日，</p>
<p>一朶朶的雲已倦於不安的旅行；</p>
<p>許多小樹林正在收拾他們的陰影，</p>
<p>逕向死的天涯跑去的是那些車轍。</p>
<p>古池旁有幾所山毛櫸的茅舍，</p>
<p>很可憐地圈坐在四周；</p>
<p>天花板下懸掛一盞銅燈，</p>
<p>微笑滑出窗口和牆頂。</p>
<p>廣裏的平原上，靜睡的水旁，</p>
<p>有這些貧困的小屋在窺望，</p>
<p>用了他們玻璃窗上的窮眼。</p>
<p>老風車轉了一圈倦了，再轉一圈停了。</p>

<p>— 楊廉沅</p>
<p>一下午，我在烟捲吐出的淡淡底霧裏，排遣難驅的寂寥。</p>
<p>……這是可能的麼？遁避世俗的魔掌，跟繁城隔離得遠遠地，我就愛那隔牆樹林給夕陽燒得緋紅，緋紅的雲霧裏，閃過一個笑；再凝視時，這個笑就教趕回歸程的夕陽帶跑了。於是這林子有如剛散塲的劇院，殘留着，給寂寞虐待得浮生　凄凉。而這笑呵，在林子裏永遠也捉摸不到了。是的，我是失落了那個笑。</p>
<p>智慧的人早就給我們說過了，人生只能有一個難再的瞬間，永恒的不會淡忘！是呵，閃現在夕陽裏的笑，一如情人彌留時嘴角上永恒的笑，但這個笑恰像哭泣，鋼樣的烙印刻入記憶，看見這個笑，比自己哭泣一整夜還要悲哀。我就像秋盡的花樹，失掉露水護持，一樹花葉像一葉詩篇，將萎的花葉低吟：芳草夕陽，來日遲遲！……</p>
<p>想着，烟蒂忽自指間落下，烟灰碰散在椅邊；唉，我是倦聽於低迴的歌聲了。剛低頭拾起墮地的烟蒂，一抬頭我真的望見一個笑，有如春三月綻開的花朶，綴滿在她臉顏，拾起的烟蒂重又滑落，眼睛剛逃出藍烟霧底重圍，真的，我迎接笑，笑從天國降下，遂辭別困人底寂寥，未燃底烟捲盡投於火。</p>
<p>一下午，沒有了烟捲，芳草夕陽全成過眼烟雲了。</p>
<p>紫色傘子</p>
<p>一下午，漫天烏雲說一個牛鬼蛇神的故事。雨霧濛濛，我真憂心那是古代的思婦白娘娘作的法來了。漂亮的瀝青路，電車站給神水包圍着，我嘲笑這現代化底交通工具，被突如其來底神水捉弄得好苦。站上鵠立一羣人，沒有表情，悵望週遭底神水發怔。天上的故事愈說愈荒唐了，整個烏雲天如同要壓下來似地，我憂心自己也許會有噩夢般底感覺：人類的末日是不是快到了？</p>
<p>「叮叮噹噹，」響着電車鈴聲，要衝破神水疾馳過去；一回頭瞥見娟秀的臉顏遮掩把紫色小傘，一舉手合攏紫色傘，娟秀的臉在黯然的天色裏閃耀着冷然的光輝，輕靈地跨進車廂；大雨珠隨即落下，抖落困惑底噩夢，我也踏進車廂了。「叮叮噹噹，」欣喜自己又走上一段路程。</p>
<p>整天生活在人羣裏的人也整天擁抱無邊的孤獨。一笑一哭，又是爲着誰呢？撐着紫色傘的行路人，請告訴我，你拭去殘留髪間的雨珠，有人在欣喜你拭去他眼眸裏的淚珠呢。路固然沒有盡頭，這列車子雖有盡頭，却仍會回來，而人羣更是永生的。紫色傘，傘上的雨珠，髪間的雨珠，你無聲的申訴說得我下淚了。</p>
<p>你只是無聲的望着欲去的地方，我也並不想探索你要去的地方。可是，我去的地方呢？回答我，望你冷然又娟秀的臉顏，我是又困惑於一次噩夢裏了。</p>
<p>天上說着的荒唐故事也該有結局了，等紫色傘移動於一列繞滿　蘿底籬牆時，天明亮了，紫色的影子遂也消失在明亮裏。</p>

<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>我撫着鼎元，就在大樹脚下伏着，其餘的人，都散開找地點伏下。我以頭上枝葉很密，看不見天空，只聽見嗡嗡的聲音，從西頭由遠而近，好像是一小隊戰鬥機，一壁飛，一壁間續的開着機槍。這時前邊大林裏的槍聲倒停止了。我以爲這隊飛機，從這裏路過，三兩分鐘也許飛過去了。誰知這可厭的一羣，儘在我們這一帶盤旋；也許剛才聽見有重機槍聲音的緣故？這樣鬧了約摸二十分鐘，又放了一陣機槍，才緩緩地向東走了。</p>
<p>「這東西多可恨！」鼎元始終說話，這時才開了口，含着笑意，對我搖了搖頭。我很明瞭他爲什麼有這點笑意。您大槪經歷過，有時您碰見一個頑劣的孩子，或是一個沒有脾胃的下流胚子，跟您無理取鬧一陣，好容易對付得他走了，您當着您朋友的面前，有些氣惱，而又不好意思認真生氣，怎麼樣？恐怕您也祇好付之一笑哩。鼎元的笑，我想就是這一類性質的笑。</p>
<p>那位青年領隊，這時我看清楚了，左耳短了一個垂珠，眼光奕奕，頗有幾分成儀；他這時跑出來，發了一個命令，大家重行上車，依照原來秩序，上路前進。我們每座汽車前面遮塵玻璃上都有一個符號，所以沿路碰見了我軍的崗哨巡哨，都不受盤阻。</p>
<p>過了田村，車子沿着公路，折向正南，天色陰暗，沉悶，因之心口上，如同壓了一片石塊，非常不舒服。一會，車子又折向西南，馳行甚速，砲火的聲音，一步比一步響了。到了一個交叉路口，見朝永定河橋的去路，有樹枝亂木壨斷了。我們的車子祇好停下。這時崗哨上有兩名弟兄，對我們揮手，好像叫我們退回原路。他們一邊揮手，一面向我們車子跑來，我們的青年領隊也下車迎了上去。我仔細注目向又道上一看，見隱隱約約沿路邊似乎有粗粗佈置的事工，還有一些弟兄們伏在那裏。我一想，有些不妙；這裏正是宛平的西北，至少也有五公里的直綫距離，砲聲響得那麼近，這裏又有佈防的形跡，換句話，宛平的前綫恐怕有些不穩定了。</p>
<p>青年領隊同崗哨談了話之後，立刻砲到我車子前來，說是宛平戰局有了變動，我們這條路，過了橋，就有流彈，問我「還是繞大圈，還是照這條路走？」我不敢回頭探詢鼎元的意見，只硬着頭皮回答說：「衝過去罷！」</p>
<p>車子剛過橋，就看見田野，山坡，沿河，像螞蟻似的，四鄉的村農，男女老少，爭先恐後，向西淌了去。再進，我發現田邊有倒下的人體，再前一些，果然就有嘶嘶的聲音，那是流彈，從頭上飛過。</p>
<p>「咦！」鼎元好像從夢裏驚醒轉來似的，「我記得咱們上午是走的宛平東邊，倒不大聽見流彈，現在走的西邊，隔開十多里哪，怎麼有流彈？……長辛店也該有流彈哪！……」</p>
<p>我怎麼答覆他呢？他的神經很衰弱，又累了這麼一天，我要告訴他真話，說不定就有很不美的現象發生。您說：「就不應該讓他再回長辛店來嗎？」這話我也很同意，可是，萬一到了長辛店，有許多意想不到的問題，必須取決於他本人，那時又怎麼辦呢？况且他的個性很強，又不是孩子，由得您播弄？」</p>
<p>「也許戰綫有些轉移吧。……」我這麼輕描淡寫地說了一句。其餘的事，祇好讓他自己想下去了。</p>
<p>「那麼，長辛店怎麼樣？……北平臨動身，可惜您沒先打個電話！」他的神色逐漸緊張起來。</p>
<p>「打也無益，不是嗎？……因爲打仗的玩意，瞬息萬變，……也許長辛店暫時不在目標之內？」</p>

<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>沒收逆產中，酌留家屬生活費問題，直到現在，逆在有關當局硏討中，並未能有一個具體的規定。</p>
<p>其所以然者，原因在主特人認爲其中有不少困難，比如逆　有多有少，其間相差極大，倘使規定了一華生活費數目，而有許多逆產的總値還不足此數，那怎麽辦？倘使規定了一百分比，而有許多逆產的千分之一，已經足够使其家屬過一種極豪奢的生活而有餘，那又怎麽辦？</p>
<p>從這樣看來，似乎很棘手，其實，認爲　難者，並沒有能把握到問題的核心。我們知道，懲治漢奸條例中其所以有酌留若干家屬生活費者，無非本「罪不及　孥」之意，根據這一種矜惜的法意，漢奸財產的多寡決不是我們處理時注意的焦點，我們　問所留的財產修不够他的家屬生活。</p>
<p>通常人的生活費用是有一個標準的，用這個標準再來決定留給的數字，倘使逆產總値不够此數，政府也沒有津貼的道理；倘使逆產爲數甚大，也更不能因爲總値大而增大其家屬的生活費。</p>
<p>據說，明天逆產處理委員會將開會商討此事，謹以此蒭見貢獻給委員諸公作參考。</p>

<p>— 魯鈍父</p>
<p>最近本市的黃牛黨，似乎氣燄萬丈，不可一世。先從最近發生的二則「黃牛黨」新聞說起：</p>
<p>一則是上海魚市場，派職員到北站搬運到埠魚貨，遭黃牛黨「當員」數名，攔途勒索，結果魚市塲職員報吿警局，前往彈壓，始吿平息。</p>
<p>有一則是大美晚報的記者，在大　戲院門前，發現一位××與一名黃牛黨黨員躱在附近巷內分贓，適有另一××想來一分一杯羹」，險乎打成一團。並且有兩位黃牛黨員向該記者兜售戲票時，有一位××在旁努力慫慂。</p>
<p>從第一則新聞，可以見到黃牛黨的潛勢力，是相當「煊赫」。居然「擁兵割據」，要經過他的「勢力範圍」，嘿嘿！快放下「買路錢」來！</p>
<p>從第二條新聞，足見黃牛黨居然有少數××在做他們的「應聲蟲」，「尾巴」！羽翼已成，狼狽爲奸，自然是「風調雨順」，「得其所哉」了。</p>
<p>何謂黃牛　「黃牛」這名詞，原是上海人用來稱人一沒有肩膀一的，（意即不負責任，）滑頭掮各，荷花大少，都是「黃牛」專家。而「黃牛」的成爲「黨」，大槪在敵僞時期，「發祥地」在北火車站。因當時鐵道交通，紊亂不堪，買票難，難於上靑天！當你提了皮箱，擠在長長的人羣中，汗流浹背，感到走頭無路的時候，會有人在你身旁掛着狡猾的笑臉，輕輕地問你：「到啥塲化？」他會掏出一大疊車票，漫天討價，你在無可奈何之下，只得忍痛作成他一筆交易。那時售黑市票的「黨員」——即曾經大紅大紫的「黑帽子」——人數衆多，也有些組織，聰明的上海人，仙送了他們「黃牛黨」的雅號。僞府時代雖也曾經「明令」取締，並且「羅靑天」好像　「私行察訪」了一次，常塲槍決「黨員」一名，「以儆傚尤一，可是他的下級幹部，却是「　　不遺餘力一，倒霉的「先烈，畢竟還是黃牛黨的元勳。</p>

<p>此種「敵僞遺風」，我們的當局自然不容漠視，看近來報上刋載「捉拿黃牛黨」的消息，我們懇切地期望着，當局應下一除惡務盡」的決心，對這些「黃牛黨」予以澈底的肅淸，並嚴厲査懲那些與「黃牛黨一狼狽爲奸的××和售票員！</p>

<p>原子筆簽發支票宣吿無效後，牠的身價並不因此而降低，因爲他對於航空人員，游泳家，旅行家，以及繁忙的人，都有很大的幫助。一般的人們，對於牠的構造，總很渴望知道的罷！</p>
<p>數年前，美國某科學家，已經公佈，他發明一種新的筆尖，可以代替現在所通用的筆尖，它的性能，是比較的優秀，省墨水，不抓着字紙，以及很多的優點，不過沒有被採用，直到去年，才被採納了。結果牠的優點，的確多於牠的劣點，而且牠的成功，是人們所想像不到的。</p>
<p>原子筆的秘密，全在乎一個筆尖，讀者如果注意一點，一定可以發現它是一粒極小的鋼珠，這鋼珠旋轉在筆的尖端的小窩中，　寫的時候，就旋轉而靠它分子的附　力，吸着極微量的墨水，而分佈成一薄層，留在紙上，成你所寫的字。</p>
<p>就因爲牠耗費　水量非常少，和筆管中容量之大，因此灌一次墨水，可以畫一條二十一英哩長的直綫，平均以常人的書寫，可以用兩年餘之久，用完墨水後，可以再灌，完全和平常鋼筆一樣，那用完後便爲廢物之說，是不確的。</p>
<p>它的筆管，不過是一個空管，含有一個尖頭，以流下墨水在　珠上，也有把它製成活動而可調換的。</p>
<p>在全筆的上端，有一個小孔，通着盛墨水的地方，在寫不出墨水時，可以用口在小孔處吹氣，而且它又可以使兩面壓力均勻，而不滲漏。</p>
<p>它所用的，不是平常的墨水，而是特製的油墨，類糊狀物，有快乾的特性，隨寫隨乾。</p>
<p>它特別的地方不止此，而且可以寫字在衣裳上，更奇特的是它可以在水中寫字，這是任何的筆所不能做的事。</p>

<p>前些時中共發言人王炳南曾經宣佈，中共軍將放棄一切據點，在全國採取大規模的游繫戰術。這個消息，並不可怕。但後來，據聯合社訊，延安電台又以廣播發出警告：「國軍在蘇北行將發現者，並非天堂，而係墳墓」，該電台並且說明了蘇北何以將成爲墳墓的原因稱：「該區共軍已注重游擊流動戰」云。語意明顯而且肯定，這就不免使蘇北人民甚至全中國人民發生幽默之感了。</p>
<p>蘇北一經有了中共軍的游擊流動戰，便將成爲　墓，則在全國範圍內，有了中共軍的游擊流動戰，自亦不難使全中國變成一個大的墳墓。中共這種爲國爲民的「忠誠抱負」，當然値得全中國人民的「喝采」。但假如中共的這一抱負果眞實現了，那整個中國又將成一種什麼樣子呢？答曰：</p>

<h3 id="e1">Government Issues Solemn Statement, Puts Forward Final Limit of Tolerance, CCP Should Bear Full Responsibility for Disrupting Judgment <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 2nd] At 4:30 PM on the 2nd, the Central Propaganda Department held a temporary press conference for Chinese and foreign reporters, presided over by Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Cuo. Minister Peng first read out the government's important statement on the current situation, the full text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>The government has already agreed to hold a five-person meeting to discuss the reorganization of the National Government Committee, and recently prepared to hold a three-person meeting to discuss ceasefire methods. Unexpectedly, the CCP suddenly issued a statement yesterday, negating the above two meetings, and announced in an autocratic manner that an unconditional ceasefire was necessary, and that it was unwilling to discuss anything else. The government has always advocated using negotiations and political methods to seek a reasonable and legal solution. If the CCP refuses to negotiate and disrupts the two meetings that are about to be held, then the CCP should be fully responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom. An unconditional ceasefire has been implemented twice this year, in January and June, but because there was no effective guarantee, it stopped and started again. As a result, the country has suffered increasingly heavy losses over the past ten months, and the suffering of the people has been unimaginable. There have been ceasefire agreements and military reorganization plans in the past, but the CCP still used the ceasefire period to occupy cities where its military strength was superior, blatantly disregarding them. Where its military strength was inferior, it took the opportunity to enrich and reorganize its military preparations in order to launch another attack on the National Army. Now the Communist Party is issuing mobilization orders on the one hand and raising ceasefire slogans on the other. If there is no real guarantee, the government, responsible for maintaining law and order for the country and protecting the lives and property of the people, cannot allow the people to suffer the pain of civil strife for a long time. Therefore, it is necessary to seek a reasonable and legal solution to the urgent political and military problems in order to seek a practical and effective guarantee and establish lasting peace. The government has sent the following main points to Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart in a letter.</p>
<p>The Issue of Government Commissioners and Garrisoned Troops Should Be Resolved Quickly</p>
<p>In order to save time and show its sincerity, the government frankly states the maximum extent to which it can compromise on resolving the current situation as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The CCP has been constantly urging the reorganization of the National Government, and the key to the reorganization is the distribution of seats. The government originally agreed that the CCP would have eight seats on the National Government Committee, the China Democratic League four, for a total of twelve seats. The CCP demanded ten seats for the CCP and four for the China Democratic League, for a total of fourteen seats. Now the government compromises by conceding eight seats to the CCP, four to the China Democratic League, and one seat among the non-party members to be recommended by the CCP. The government agrees, for a total of thirteen seats. The CCP should immediately submit the list of CCP members of the National Government Committee and the list of its representatives to the National Assembly, but this agreement should be agreed upon by the informal five-person group meeting and then submitted to the comprehensive group for agreement. (2) In order to effectively implement the military reorganization plan, the garrison locations of the CCP's eighteen divisions should be quickly stipulated, and they should enter the garrison locations within the prescribed time limit in accordance with the regulations. This resolution should be formally agreed upon by the three-person meeting and then submitted to the Military Mediation Executive Department for supervision and implementation.</p>
<p>If the CCP is truly sincere in seeking peace and cooperation and is willing to quickly resolve these two issues, then both parties should immediately announce the cessation of military action when an agreement is reached. The press conference adjourned at 6:00 PM. In the evening, reporters asked the CCP delegation about its reaction to the government's statement. According to spokesman Mei Yi, the government's memorandum was sent to Shanghai by a special person tonight. The CCP's attitude will depend on whether Representative Zhou Enlai reads it and asks for instructions from Yan'an. In addition, after the government issued this statement, the Nanjing Central Daily News immediately issued an extra edition at 6:30 PM in the afternoon. The people of the capital have gained a new understanding of the current situation and deeply understand the government's painstaking efforts to seek peace through tolerance. The change in the current situation has now stopped in anticipation. Mr. and Mrs. Men arrived in Beijing one day, and Foreign Minister Wang received them at the Foreign Ministry's official residence on the afternoon of the 2nd.</p>

The British Liberal Party believes that a strong and unified China is indispensable for lasting world peace, and therefore they are deeply concerned about China's efforts to achieve this goal.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 2nd] The Capital High Court opened a court session at 10:00 AM on the 2nd to publicly try Wang Yintai. The court debate concluded at 1:00 PM in the afternoon, and the sentence was scheduled to be pronounced at 10:00 AM on the 8th. Wang was returned to custody.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 2nd] After the arch-traitor Wang Yitang was sentenced to death by the Hebei High Court, his daughter and defense lawyer argued that Wang Yitang could not speak due to illness and that the court had proceeded directly to judgment, requesting a retrial. During this period, Wang Yitang actually published a notice in the Beiping newspaper on the 2nd, asking his lawyers Fa Zanxi and Gao Chengen to say, "The judge presiding over my case is He Chengzhuo, President of the Hejiang High Court and concurrently Chief Judge of the Criminal Court of the Hebei High Court, with the style name Kongchao. It is found that the presiding judge served as the Director of Academic Affairs of the Pseudo-Judicial Officer Training Institute affiliated to the Pseudo-North China Political Affairs Commission during the pseudo-organization period. Gui Buji (reporter's note: Gui was the Director of the North China Branch of the Pseudo-Judicial Administration Department and has been sentenced to life imprisonment) can be interrogated and the staff roster of the Pseudo-Judicial Officer Training Institute can be consulted." He continued: "If it is said that Yitang is a major traitor, the presiding judge is a minor traitor under the control of Yitang. After the restoration of the country, the work of judging traitors is actually entrusted to traitors. What will the world think of this generation? Although Yitang has political mistakes, he has read the books of sages and adheres to the teachings of shame. He is deeply afraid of leaving a great shame on the history of judging traitors in the Chinese nation. Therefore, he has not said a word in the past trials, and he has unspeakable pain. If he is sentenced to capital punishment by this traitor judge, Yitang will not rest in peace. In addition to presenting to Chairman Chiang of the National Government, President Song of the Executive Yuan, President Ju of the Judicial Yuan, President Yu of the Supervisory Yuan, and Inspector Li of Hebei, stating that the court organization is illegal, maintaining judicial dignity, and protecting national integrity, he has specially hired lawyers to publish the notice." It is reported that when Chairman Chiang first came to Ping, he secretly informed He of being a traitor, but after Deng Zhexi, President of the Hebei High Court, proved that He was acting under Deng's orders and engaged in underground work in the judicial circles of Ping, he was given a non-prosecution disposition.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 2nd] Preparations for the National Assembly are about to be completed. Hong Lanyou said on the morning of the 2nd that although the convocation order has not been issued today, given the current traffic situation, it is not too late to issue the convocation order on the day the registration begins. The Preparatory Committee will close on the day of the opening ceremony, and the Secretary-General will take over the relevant matters. When the convocation order is issued, a news group will be established, or the Central Propaganda Department will be requested to send personnel to assist. However, the number of seats for the audience is limited, and it is feared that too many reporters cannot be accommodated. It is also said that although the preparations are all in place, the authorities always hope to convene the meeting in a harmonious atmosphere.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City News] A spokesman for the Propaganda Department of the Chinese Youth Party said: "The Shanghai Ta Kung Pao Nanjing special dispatch on October 1 stated that, regarding the National Assembly representatives, 'Since the government issued the notice asking the various parties to submit the list of representatives, only the Youth Party has submitted the entire list so far.' It has been found that our party has not submitted the list of National Assembly representatives. The news is completely inconsistent with the facts."</p>
<h3 id="e17">Statistics on Communist Army's Violations of Agreement After Signing of Ceasefire Agreement <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Relevant parties recently compiled statistics on the important facts of the Communist Army's violations of the agreement and attacks on the National Army since the signing of the ceasefire agreement on January 13, and explained their process and impact as follows: (1) Northeast Region (January 13 to the end of May), after the government and the CCP issued a ceasefire order on March 10, the Communist side violated the agreement and suddenly occupied Yingkou on January 14, and subsequently occupied Fushun, Benxi, Siping Street, Weichun, Harbin, and other places, and gathered 170,000 troops in Siping Street to attack our northbound National Army that was receiving sovereignty. The war in the Northeast broke out as a result, and it affected the interior (according to Lin Biao, the commander of the Communist Army in the Northeast Region, used about 200,000 troops). (2) Shandong Region (beginning in early June), after the chairman issued the second ceasefire order on June 6, the Communist side actually took the opportunity to launch a large-scale offensive in Shandong, occupying Zaozhuang on the 9th, and Dezhou and Taian on the 10th, disregarding the restrictions of the Military Mediation Department, and occupying Gaomi, Jiaoxian, Nanquan, Lancun, and many other cities and towns. At the same time, a large army of 50,000 men was gathered on the outskirts of Qingdao, and more than 100,000 men were gathered on the outskirts of Jinan, fiercely besieging the suburbs of the two cities, especially the most dangerous situation of approaching the water source of Qingdao, Nanquan and Huangbu. The coal and grain areas of Jinan were also fiercely besieged. In order to protect Qingdao and Jinan, the government had the Jiaoji Road War (according to Chen Yi, the commander of the Communist Army in the Shandong Region, used about 150,000 troops). (3) JinSui Region (beginning in early June), after the Communist Army occupied Houma and Jining, it echoed Shandong in early June and launched a large-scale offensive against Shanxi, successively occupying Wenxi, Shuoxian, Xinjiang, Yuci, Jiexiu, Jiangxian, Shanyin, Ningwu, Fanshi, Daixian, Jiaocheng, Lishi, Huairen, Hongdong, Zhaocheng, Qin County, Ying County, Hunyuan, Wuhe, Huoxian, Lingshi, Fenxi, and other 22 counties, and actively destroying the Zhengtai and Tongpu Roads, gradually completing the encirclement of Datong and Taiyuan, thus causing the Jinan War (according to He Long, Liu Bocheng, Han Jun, and Nie Rongzhen, the commanders of the Communist Army in the JinSui Border Region, used about 90,000 troops). (4) Northern Jiangsu Region (beginning on July 13), after the government issued a declaration on June 30, emphasizing its willingness to resolve the situation politically, the Communist Army actually gathered 16 regiments, about 40,000 men, and suddenly attacked Taixing on July 13. In this battle, our defending army, the 83rd Division, was forced to fight in a hurry, resulting in heavy casualties. After the Communist Army captured the city on the 15th, it continued to attack Taixian and the important town of Kouan on the north bank of the Yangtze River, attempting to threaten Nanjing and Shanghai. The National Army was forced to resist, and the Northern Jiangsu War broke out (according to Chen Yi, the commander of the Communist Army in the Northern Jiangsu Region, used about 40,000 troops). (5) Datong Region (beginning on August 3), since mid-June, the Communist Army has successively occupied Shanyin, Hunyuan, Daixian, Shuoxian, Huairen, Fanshi, Ying County, Ningwu, Yunxian, and other nine counties on the outskirts of Datong, and launched a real battle to besiege Datong on August 3, using more than 30 regiments, about 50,000 men, and attacking a total of 35 times, causing heavy casualties to soldiers and civilians on the outskirts of Datong, and disregarding the government's repeated warnings. Therefore, there was a war to relieve the siege of Datong (according to He Long, the commander of the Communist Army in the Datong Region, used about 50,000 troops). It is also known that the Communist Army has violated the ceasefire order and attacked the National Army 4,852 times since September 13. Since the surrender of Japan, the Communist Army has captured 344 county seats inside and outside the customs.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Current Financial and Monetary Situation: The Government Resolves to Improve It. Premier Song Explains Financial and Economic Policies to the Shanghai Petition Delegation, Striving to Contract Currency and Stabilize Prices. <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The Shanghai Municipal Assembly's Commerce and Industry Petition Delegation, after petitioning the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry on the morning of the 2nd, proceeded to the Executive Yuan to meet with Yu Hung-chun and Wang Yun-wu, the two ministers, continuing the discussions from yesterday. The two ministers expressed their appreciation for the points raised by the delegation and promised to convey them to Premier Song. The talks began at 11:00 AM and concluded at 1:00 PM, lasting a total of two hours. At 4:00 PM, the representatives met with Premier Song, and departed at 5:00 PM. Some of the representatives braved the rain for a tour of Xuanwu Lake, and in the evening, attended a banquet hosted by the Bank of Communications, with Speaker Pan Gongzhan also in attendance. The petition delegation, after two days of hard work, met with Chairman Chiang, Premier Song, and the heads of relevant agencies to advocate for Shanghai's industry and commerce, concluding their mission to Nanjing. They will return to Shanghai successively on the 2nd and 3rd to report the progress of their trip to the more than four million citizens of Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] When Premier Song met with representatives of the Shanghai Municipal Assembly's Petition Delegation at the Executive Yuan at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, he gave a brief explanation of the government's current financial and economic policies, and with a very sincere attitude, stated that the government is currently making its utmost efforts to improve the current financial and monetary situation, so that the currency will no longer inflate and prices will no longer rise. Mr. Song expressed interest in the delegation's proposal to organize an economic rehabilitation committee in Shanghai. He also promised to humbly adopt other suggestions and agreed to instruct relevant ministries and commissions to discuss practical solutions. He would do his best to implement those that could be done, and he was unwilling to make unrealistic promises for those that could not. Mr. Song wore a light green Hong Kong shirt today, and was in good spirits, speaking with the representatives in fluent Shanghainese, appearing very cordial, as many of the representatives had known Mr. Song for one or two decades. Minister Yu of the Ministry of Finance and Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, who were also present, had close ties with Shanghai in the past. Therefore, the conversation proceeded in a very harmonious atmosphere throughout.</p>
<h3 id="e19">If There Is No Solution to the Financial Problem, the Economy Will Be Difficult to Improve. The Government Has No Intention of Competing with the People for Profit. <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Song first explained that finance and the economy are closely related, and if there is no solution to the financial problem, the economy will be difficult to improve, and vice versa. Some people blame the government for focusing solely on finance and neglecting the economy, but this is not entirely true. He then explained the current economic situation, pointing out that if the situation were clarified, the economy would have already improved. However, the situation is not so ideal. The situation in South China is relatively better, while North China is affected by traffic obstruction and transportation cannot be smooth, which affects production. For example, before the war, North China produced abundant cotton, and our country's cotton production was almost self-sufficient. Now, we have to rely heavily on foreigners. Coal also has to be transported from Qinhuangdao, and a portion has to be purchased from foreign countries. Under such circumstances, expenditures naturally increase, and income decreases accordingly. The gap between income and expenditure is widening. There are two ways to make up for the difference: namely, issuing more currency and finding ways to increase income. The former is likely to cause currency inflation, affect price increases, and raise wages and interest rates, which is not a good policy. Therefore, we must start by increasing income. The authorities are doing their best to do anything that can increase financial income. For example, enemy and puppet materials must be sold at the best possible price, so as not to allow a few people to benefit from the sale at a low price. In addition, the establishment of companies such as the China Textile Corporation is aimed at bringing legal tender back into circulation, contracting currency, and balancing or approximating income and expenditure, and making every effort to prevent currency inflation and price increases. At this point, Mr. Song said in a firm and confident tone: What I am doing is for all of you (referring to the representatives), for Shanghai, and for the general public, not entirely for the government. The government has learned of your suggestions regarding industrial, commercial, and agricultural loan programs, and will humbly accept them, and will instruct the relevant ministries and commissions to conduct practical research. Those that can be done will be done, and those that cannot be done will not be promised in vain. He expressed interest in the delegation's proposal to establish an Economic Rehabilitation Committee, because economic construction cannot only be about preserving residual work, but also about seeking expansion and increase. In the future, Japan's reparations to the Allied countries can be expected to be a large part of our country's share. These reparations of materials and factories should not only be sold, but an institution can be organized to jointly deal with them. The name does not have to be the Rehabilitation Committee. This institution will formulate an entire plan, such as artificial silk machines can be claimed from Japan, but factory sites and working capital must be carefully studied and planned. Other industries can also use this method to jointly carry out operations. Finally, Mr. Song explained that the government has no intention of competing with the people for profit. He said: The government's handling of the China Textile Corporation is to increase government revenue. If all Japanese textile factories were sold at that time, there would not be such a large revenue to make up for the national treasury. The government's policy is that, for large-scale enterprises, unless state-owned is impossible, it is very willing to study with all parties to organize a committee to jointly promote them. Our vision should not only focus on the present, but also plan for the future. The amount of Japanese reparations is very large. The problem lies in how much can be utilized. I deeply hope to work with you to discuss how to make good use of them.</p>
<h3 id="e20">If the Situation Is Not Clarified, It Is Inevitable That One Thing Is Neglected for Another. The Government's Difficulties Are the People's Difficulties. <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>After Premier Song finished speaking, the representatives spoke separately. Xi Yushu spoke first, raising the following points: (1) He hoped that the government's financial policy could be flexible and that banking specialization could be realized as soon as possible, and that the restrictions on commercial banks could be relaxed, allowing property to be used as reserve funds, and that the deadline for paying reserve funds could be changed from monthly to quarterly. He hoped that the procedures for industrial, commercial, and agricultural loans could be simplified and that they could be recycled so that the people could benefit from them. (2) Shanghai factories deeply feel the pain of insufficient electricity supply. He hoped that plans could be made as soon as possible to get through the difficult seasons, and that when lending to factories, real estate and machinery could also be used as collateral, because using raw materials and finished products as collateral would affect costs. (3) He hoped that tax rules could be simplified and that tax sources could be cultivated. (4) In terms of international trade, we should be vigilant against Japan's return, and he hoped that large amounts of loans could be made for export materials that could bring in foreign exchange. In terms of imports, we should find ways to prevent certain materials from entering the country and prevent smuggling, and we should facilitate the import of machinery, and the settlement of foreign exchange should not be limited to those who can import within three months. (5) The market from time to time issues unfounded rumors about foreign exchange, which greatly affects prices. He hoped that those who stir up trouble with US dollars could be set a trap so that the evildoers would suffer themselves. (6) State-owned enterprises should be treated the same as private enterprises so that they can develop equally. After he finished speaking, Mr. Song responded, explaining that the government has found a way to use US ships to generate electricity to solve the electricity problem in Shanghai. He also said: Many phenomena are contradictory. For example, this year there has been a bumper harvest everywhere, and there are large amounts of disaster relief materials to help us carry out post-disaster work, and the surplus materials are also very beneficial to our construction. It is a pity that the situation has not been clarified, so the government has to adopt transitional measures, resulting in the phenomenon of neglecting one thing for another. Then, Jin Runxiang spoke, explaining that the government's difficulties are the people's difficulties, and the people's suffering is the government's suffering. Having this opportunity to explain to each other can increase mutual understanding. He expressed his gratitude to Premier Song for humbly adopting public opinion. He hoped that the Rehabilitation Committee could be established as soon as possible to achieve unity between officials and the people. The government currently has difficulties, but it cannot therefore neglect economic construction. He hoped that both aspects can be taken into account to overcome the difficulties together. Luo Qinghua spoke, hoping that talents can be widely recruited and the Rehabilitation Committee can be established as soon as possible to relieve the suffering of industry and commerce, and that loans will not fall into the hands of speculators, and that the scale should be slightly relaxed to comfort the people's hopes. Finally, Wang Yansong spoke, hoping that the boundaries between state-owned and private enterprises can be eliminated, and suggested that the financial and economic ministries should hire people with history and qualifications in the financial and industrial sectors to establish an advisory committee that meets regularly to listen to the opinions of private enterprises. Mr. Song agreed to discuss this suggestion with the two ministers. The meeting had lasted for about an hour at this point. Just then, Ambassador Stuart came to visit the premier, and the representatives then took their leave.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Chiefs of All Departments and Offices of the Executive Headquarters Expressed Weariness. <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After Chiang Ting-fu resigned, yesterday the chiefs of all departments and offices of the Executive Headquarters expressed weariness. Liu Hongsheng also had the intention of being the executive director. However, it is generally believed that those who are bound to leave include Deputy Directors Li Zhuomin and Pu Xuefeng, General Affairs Director Hu Rishi, Investigation Director Xiang Jingyun, Distribution Director Wang Fusheng, Finance Director Dong Chengdao, and Zheng Baonan, Chen Zhimai, and Shen Weitai of the Office in the United States.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is definitely known that the British government had learned of Mr. Chiang's resignation beforehand, and had criticized that the transportation situation of the Executive Headquarters had not only not improved, but had also deteriorated. If improvements are not made, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration will consider suspending all relief supplies to China.</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday, Director Chiang went to the office as usual and worked, with a calm attitude, seemingly waiting for the handover. It is said that the internal personnel of the Executive Headquarters will undergo major changes in this reorganization, but the position of Executive Director Liu Hongsheng will not change.</p>

<p>At the Executive Headquarters work review conference held in Nanjing this month, Mr. Chiang made a detailed self-review of the work of the Executive Headquarters.

<h3 id="e25">The Changchun Railway Is Full of Scars. The Railway Tracks and Bridges Were Severely Damaged by the Communists. Currently, Less Than 600 Kilometers Are Open to Traffic. <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 2nd] The Sino-Soviet joint venture Changchun Railway, stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, has been struggling in pain for half a year due to reception and military relations, and it has been very difficult to survive. Wang Zhuting, Deputy Director of the Railway, spoke about the current situation of the railway, saying: Before March this year, the Changchun Railway was under Soviet military management. The National Army advanced into Shenyang, and the Communist Army retreated northwards step by step. In April, I flew from Harbin to Shenyang. The Harbin Railway General Bureau was managed by the Soviet Director. After the Shenyang Railway Branch Bureau was established in April, the National Army began rushing to repair and transport. The Changchun Railway merged the Middle East and South Manchurian Railways, with a total length of over 1,818 kilometers. Currently, the section that has been taken over and opened to traffic extends from Yingkou in the south to the First Songhua River in the north, with a length of over 597 kilometers. The area under the jurisdiction of the branch bureau currently has 16,600 employees, including 240 Soviet citizens, and 77 Soviet citizens in places such as the Fushun Coal Mine. There are also about 800 Japanese technical employees. Military transport and repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war are very fast. Due to the shortage of vehicles for passenger and freight transport, the maximum daily transport capacity is only 100 vehicles, most of which are grain and salt, and a small number of fruits. The daily income is only 5 to 6 million circulation coupons. Due to the large difference between income and expenditure, the government subsidizes about 150 million yuan per month. However, because the Communist Army severely damaged the railway bridges, the funds for the emergency repair project are very large. In the future, freight transport must be used to make up for the shortfall and reduce government losses. In addition, the Soviet Union has recently not expressed any opinion on the Changchun Railway. The situation of the General Bureau and the northern section of the railway is currently unknown.</p>

<p>Mr. Chiang has resigned more than once, and the Executive Yuan's handling of him is really quite interesting. For example, the Executive Yuan ordered him to compile the Executive Headquarters budget, and the result was a considerable figure of 432 billion yuan. The Executive Yuan actually reversed its usual practice and approved it immediately without deduction. Mr. Chiang was of course very happy. It was not until he was preparing to receive the funds from the Executive Yuan that the Executive Yuan said that the 432 billion yuan "post-disaster relief fund" had already been allocated to the relevant agencies such as the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Water Conservancy Commission for post-disaster relief work. If the Executive Headquarters wants money, you have to go to them!</p>
<p>The budget was prepared by the Executive Headquarters, but the result was that not a penny was received. In other words, the government did not give money. Mr. Chiang had to rely on borrowing from banks and selling supplies to maintain expenses, but when President Bei of the Central Bank took office, he said bluntly: "We run a bank, not a charity. If you want to borrow money, first show us the collateral." Of course, if you really want to talk about collateral, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration would immediately fly into a rage, especially since the Director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, La Guardia, is known for his fearless temper!</p>
<p>Speaking of selling supplies, this matter has long been the target of public criticism, and the Executive Headquarters has been scolded as the "Relief Headquarters itself" for this. Moreover, at one point, the relief supplies only consisted of food, but food was later explicitly prohibited from being sold by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Therefore, the Executive Headquarters was completely unable to move. Mr. Chiang had to submit four proposals to the Executive Yuan: First, please allocate funds; second, please allow the Executive Headquarters to borrow from banks; third, allow the Executive Headquarters to contact the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to ship a little less supplies to save expenses; fourth, allow him to resign.</p>
<p>Premier Song was very unhappy when he heard this, and said: "You only know how to ask me for money. If you don't have money, you shout about resigning! If you can resign, can't I resign?"</p>
<p>Therefore, Premier Song's solution was neither to give money nor to allow him to resign—however, the Central Bank finally agreed to the Executive Headquarters' request and borrowed 80 billion yuan, but with one condition: the Executive Headquarters must repay the Central Bank 10 billion yuan every month.</p>
<p>The immediate crisis was resolved, but what followed were countless fragmented small stimuli, but unfortunately we cannot publish them here for the time being.</p>
<p>Mr. Chiang is from Hunan and has a very straightforward temper. Moreover, he is a scholar and an ethical person. Therefore, he has a hard-working spirit—but he has really been able to suppress this bad mood!</p>
<p>Last month, the Executive Headquarters convened its branch offices in Nanjing and held a work review meeting. At this meeting, Mr. Chiang delivered a sharp speech, reversing the usual practice in officialdom and speaking extremely bluntly. Nanjing and Shanghai immediately spread the news that Mr. Chiang was going to resign, and everyone believed that Mr. Chiang was writing a conclusion to his work, and he was bound to leave. Unexpectedly, the Executive Headquarters suddenly issued a denial message, but the "denial" was very reluctant. At that time, when our newspaper recorded this news, it added the sentence "All parties are still closely watching." The result is: it really came!</p>
<p>Everyone remembers that Hu Shih, Ding Wenjiang, Weng Wenhao, Chiang Ting-fu, He Lian, and others all laid down their teaching posts and stepped onto the political stage at the same time. Now, Mr. Chiang seems to be the only one left. Although the position of the Executive Headquarters is difficult to hold, the situation cannot be said to be small. Mr. Fu Mengzhen put it best: "Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. Although Mr. Chiang has not been able to meet the requirements of all parties in the past year, and he has had disagreements with his direct superiors, what can he do? I personally heard Premier Song say: "Chiang Ting-fu does not know how to do business." I suddenly realized that this is the standard!"</p>
<p>Mr. Chiang may return to the classroom. Three universities in the United States have already invited him to teach. Mr. Chiang's resignation is meaningful: it seems to symbolize the end of "scholars in politics." We do not seem to be able to imagine asking scholars to specialize in "business," do we?</p>
<p>Mr. Chiang's successor, Huo Baoshu, has served in the banking sector for a very long time. Presumably, he is sure to be proficient in "business." We firmly believe that the Executive Headquarters will be able to have a new look from now on. When the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Far East Conference is held in November, we would very much like to hear what the most picky US representative, Gip Quirk, and the Soviet representative, Seminas, have to say?</p>
<h3 id="e32">Zhang Junmai, Representative of the Democratic Party, Expresses Opinions on the Current Situation: Two Matters Should Be Resolved Before the National Assembly Convenes <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Junmai, leader of the Democratic Socialist Party, recently expressed the party's views on the current situation, stating: "On the 28th of last month, newspapers published a statement by Chief Secretary Wu to Agence France-Presse, which included the following passage: 'The government still hopes that the Chinese Communist Party and the Democratic League will participate in the National Assembly. Invitations have already been issued, and both the CCP and the Democratic League are among those invited. There is no reason for them to refuse to participate. Implementing the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and convening the National Assembly is the government's policy.' A reporter asked: 'If the CCP ultimately refuses to participate and causes the conference to collapse, what will the government do?' Mr. Wu replied: 'In any case, the National Assembly will be convened according to the scheduled date, which is November 12th of this year. There will be no changes. Currently, we still hope that the CCP can participate in the conference.'"</p>
<p>After reading this passage, we feel that it gives the impression that the government has decided to convene the National Assembly according to the scheduled date, and that the CCP and the Democratic League intend to refuse to participate after receiving the invitations. This statement is likely to cause misunderstanding among the people of the country and the world. The Democratic Socialist Party is a cooperative group with the Democratic League, and since the government's statement involves the Democratic League, the Democratic Socialist Party should clarify its position.</p>
<p>Since the Political Consultative Conference began in January, all parties have had an understanding of political issues, namely, to resolve everything through consultation and not resort to force. However, after the conclusion of the conference, the list of National Government members and National Assembly representatives was affected by the issue of the Nine Eastern Provinces, which impacted the reorganization of the government and the convening of the National Assembly. As a result, the list of National Government members and National Assembly representatives was not submitted. In late April, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek gathered representatives from five parties to discuss the issue of convening the National Assembly. Everyone believed that the National Assembly was related to national unity. If the National Assembly was convened solely by the Kuomintang, other parties would not agree to participate, and the only opportunity for the country to achieve unity would be lost, irreparably. In other words, China's political wounds could only be healed by this "rubber band". At the time, I personally was present and strongly advocated for postponement. This idea was adopted by Chairman Chiang, and Mr. Wang Yunwu, the current Minister of Economic Affairs, stood up to speak after the decision to postpone, requesting that a date be decided. Chairman Chiang replied that if a date was set, the meeting must be convened on schedule. Having a date and not convening the meeting is worse than not setting a date. Therefore, it was decided to postpone it. According to the spirit of the Political Consultative Conference, the postponement was decided through consultation, and the date of the meeting should be decided through consultation. However, in early July, the government unilaterally decided that the National Assembly must be convened on November 12th. In early July, it seemed that the convening date was still more than four months away, so everyone was not too worried. With a period of four months, there must be a turning point in national affairs. Therefore, they did not oppose or support the government's unilateral decision to convene, only hoping that all parties could participate together, which would naturally be the most satisfactory outcome.</p>
<p>However, the Marshall mediation plan failed to be signed on June 30th. Since then, the domestic situation has deteriorated day by day, and has now evolved into a full-scale war. It goes without saying that this approach is completely different from the situation when the Political Consultative Conference was held in January. Amid the roar of artillery fire, compatriots are killing each other, and the sacrifice of financial and human resources is immeasurable. The government intends to resolve the issues of northern Jiangsu, Chengde, and others through force. This situation is similar to the Wars of the Roses in British history and the American Civil War. Under these circumstances, it is impossible for any party or faction to participate in the National Government or the National Assembly. Therefore, in our opinion, the two things that should be resolved before the National Assembly is convened are: (1) a ceasefire; (2) consultations on the National Government, the National Assembly, and the draft constitution.</p>
<p>(A) Ceasefire</p>
<p>Whether the country can be unified in the future depends on whether the military reorganization plan can be implemented. The military reorganization plan is like the overall control of a chessboard. This plan was signed long ago during the Chongqing period, and was re-submitted in the Marshall mediation plan on June 30th. The Communist Party has also acknowledged that the ratio of five to one remains unchanged and has said that the two armies will concentrate in defensive areas and be reorganized within six months. According to this plan, the so-called overall control is still in the hands of the government and not the Communist Party. Although it cannot be said that the military has been nationalized, the first step has been taken. In our view, the foundation for domestic peace has been established by this plan. In addition to the military reorganization plan, there is the issue of gains and losses in specific areas, such as northern Jiangsu, Chengde, and even the garrisoning of troops in the Nine Eastern Provinces. We believe that this is the main cause of this war. We would like to propose the following points as solutions: (1) The Communist Party in northern Jiangsu had already acknowledged on June 30th that they would only keep one army. The dispute is whether the garrison should be stationed in Huaian or north of the Longhai Railway. We hope that the CCP will agree to withdraw its troops north of the Longhai Railway. (2) At that time, the Communist Party proposed two points: First, to retain the security force. Second, to keep the local administration unchanged. We hope that the CCP will abandon these two points, and that the government will appoint someone trusted by both sides, such as Leng Yuqiu, as the administrative head of northern Jiangsu, to soothe the people after the war, to prevent people from taking revenge on each other, and to properly resolve the land issue according to the principle of "land to the tiller." (3) Regarding Chengde, the reason why both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party must compete for Chengde is that, from the central government's perspective, the area is sufficient to threaten the railways of Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanhaiguan. From the Communist Party's perspective, it is a key station for transportation between Zhangjiakou and the Northeast. In our view, according to the talks in May and June, the central government occupies Chengde, and the area north of the city can be given to the CCP, which would be a satisfactory solution for both sides. (4) Zhangjiakou. When discussing the military reorganization issue in May and June, Chairman Chiang originally intended to have the CCP withdraw from Zhangjiakou, but Chairman Chiang agreed due to Marshall's strong advocacy, so Zhangjiakou remained with the CCP in the June compromise plan. The government's attack on Zhangjiakou this time originated from the CCP's initial attack on Datong. Now that Datong has been relieved, the government should immediately cease its attack on Zhangjiakou to fulfill Chairman Chiang's promise to Marshall and to express that it will not have further demands due to temporary military victories. (5) The issue of the Nine Eastern Provinces was already decided during the negotiations in June. The area north of Qiqihar and Yanji should be assigned to the CCP. The CCP should hand over Harbin and restore transportation on the Chinese Eastern Railway so that the central government can fulfill its obligations under the treaty with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The domestic war issue should be concluded as stated above. (Continued on page 3)</p>

<h3 id="e33">The Path to International Coordination <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Since Marshal Stalin made a statement to a reporter from the London Times, revealing the Soviet Union's conciliatory tone, some people have hoped that the three major leaders could have a meeting to resolve some of the major disputes currently, or that the Soviet Union could make factual demonstrations to alleviate the current situation with practical actions. But seeing the recent new developments in Europe, for example, the Soviet Union has once again notified the Turkish government, insisting that the Dardanelles Strait be jointly defended by the Soviet Union and Turkey, abolishing the Montreux Convention, and requiring that the Dardanelles Strait be jointly controlled by a convention established by the Black Sea countries; Moscow radio broadcasted announcements accusing Britain and the United States of violating the Potsdam Agreement and demanding that the Ruhr industrial zone be placed under international co-management instead of the current British military occupation. Things like these seem to indicate that the Soviet Union's consistent policy remains firm, so the so-called relaxation is still a question.</p>
<p>The issue of the Dardanelles Strait is not a revision of the Montreux Convention. With the changes in the environment, the amendment of the existing situation in the strait was originally agreed upon in Potsdam. The Soviet Union's position seems not to be based on the Montreux Convention, but to re-establish a new strait system centered on the Black Sea countries, with the joint defense of the southern strait by the Soviet Union and Turkey as a prerequisite. This amendment, which did not start from the Montreux Convention, has not been approved by Britain and the United States. Therefore, when the Soviet Union previously requested to amend the situation in the strait, although Turkey was able to agree to the Soviet Union's request, Britain and the United States did not approve it. This matter has been shelved until now, and the Soviet Union still reiterates the previous request and submits a new note to Turkey. It can be seen that the Soviet Union's position on foreign policy will never be easily abandoned. Speaking of international cooperation in this situation is probably just one-sided hope.</p>
<p>As for the internationalization of the Ruhr, the Soviet Union believes that the Ruhr industrial zone, which is currently the British occupation zone, has failed to effectively implement the Potsdam Agreement, so the Soviet Union advocates placing the industrial zone under international control. The Soviet Union believes that all military organizations have been dissolved in the Soviet occupation zone, all Nazis and fascists have been expelled from administrative agencies, and no factories can be used for military purposes. However, the Ruhr industrial zone, which is the base of German militarism, has failed to adopt these measures, and therefore requires international co-management. If we recite the Soviet Union's accusations and U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes's speech in Stuttgart at the same time, we can know how Britain and the United States are concerned about the unification of the postwar German national life, and at the same time, someone is trying to build a high wall or iron curtain on the divided German territory, destroying the unification of German national life. All of these are differences in the views of the two sides. What international cooperation needs is that each other can have a recognized understanding of the other's views, and then find agreement from different perspectives and seek coordination. This requires concessions from both or multiple parties; if each party insists on its own opinion and wants to force others to agree, it seems to be losing the original intention of international cooperation.</p>
<p>Since Marshal Stalin has had the previous remarks, hoping to strengthen cooperation with Western countries, if everyone has reduced intentions, it will not be difficult to find a path to coordination. President Truman reiterated his belief in peace when he visited the West Point Military Academy football game the other day, which shows that the heads of the United States and the Soviet Union have the same feelings about basic beliefs. At the same time, Ickes and Morgenthau, former members of the Roosevelt cabinet in the United States, made speeches at the Thirty-First State Liberal Party Conference, requesting President Truman to hold talks with Attlee and Stalin "to end the surprising war negotiations as soon as possible," which shows that American public opinion also advocates that the three major leaders can have a meeting to resolve the major disputes at present. What we want to state here is that we advocate closer cooperation and coordination internationally, but we must adhere to some basic principles. The Atlantic Charter, the Four Freedoms, and even the United Nations Charter are all basic principles. We are willing to sacrifice tens of millions of lives, and the purpose is to ensure these principles, such as respecting the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all independent countries, respecting the right of the people of all countries to determine their political system, etc., so we must not easily abandon these principles. "Yalta" has made a big mistake, leaving a stain on human history. While demanding international coordination, we cannot allow the repetition of "Yalta."</p>
<h3 id="e34">The Sentencing of Nazi War Criminals <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The Nuremberg International Tribunal sentenced the main Nazi war criminals on the 1st. Those sentenced to death included former Air Force Marshal Göring, former Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, and former Army Commander-in-Chief Keitel, among eleven people. Those sentenced to life imprisonment included former Navy Commander-in-Chief Raeder, Hess, and Funk, among three people. Those sentenced to 20 years in prison included Schirach and Speer. Those sentenced to 15 years in prison included former Foreign Minister Neurath. Those sentenced to 10 years in prison included former Navy Commander-in-Chief Dönitz. Those acquitted included former Ambassador to Turkey Papen, financier Schacht, and former Stormtroop Leader Frick. Regarding the acquittal of the latter three, the Soviet judge of the Nuremberg International Tribunal raised objections, believing that they should be convicted and not acquitted. Regarding Hess, the Soviet judge also believed that the original verdict was inappropriate and should be sentenced to death, but this opinion was not adopted by the International Tribunal; it was only an attachment to the verdict document, used only to express the Soviet Union's position.</p>
<p>The trial of war criminals in Nuremberg this time is a meaningful event in history. The term "war criminal" arose after this World War; although there were plans to try "war criminals" after World War I, it never became a reality due to the changing circumstances. It is a new concept to try the main ruling figures of a defeated country as the victor and accuse them of crimes. In the past, some public law scholars, especially German public law scholars, believed that war was a continuation of national policy and was not a crime in itself. Only when international regulations related to combat were violated, such as disrespecting the Red Cross flag and mistreating prisoners, did it constitute a crime. Because there is this concept that war itself is not a crime, some countries do not hesitate to use war as a means of aggression. In establishing an international legal order, we should first eradicate this erroneous concept, confirm that launching a war is itself a crime, and that the ruling figures who participate in this decision are "war criminals." National policies are determined by the ruling figures, so these ruling figures cannot escape their responsibilities. It is in this sense that we see the Nuremberg war crimes trials. There is no doubt that this trial of war criminals is an important milestone in human history. This is an example of establishing an international legal order.</p>
<p>The Nazi war criminals were accused of four crimes: (1) conspiracy to rebel, (2) undermining peace, (3) launching war, and (4) violating humanity. The establishment of this charge lies in pointing out that launching a war and thus undermining peace and violating humanity is itself a crime, and that those who participate in this decision should bear legal responsibility. For the sake of future world peace, we support the establishment of this principle to maintain the international legal order. The Nazi war criminals sentenced in Nuremberg were all the masterminds of this war, and they are now being punished as they deserve. Due to their execution, we can be sure that the Japanese war criminals currently on trial in Tokyo will soon follow in the footsteps of these Nazi war criminals and be punished as they deserve. This is indeed an event in international justice worthy of great fanfare. We deeply hope that due to the establishment of this new international legal concept, humanity can no longer use war to resolve disputes, and that humanity can live together peacefully under the order of international law, which would be the greatest harvest of this trial of war criminals.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Haining] Since the outbreak of the war of resistance, the people of this county have been ravaged by the enemy. After the victory, they hoped for a good harvest to slightly relieve their suffering. Unexpectedly, heaven defied people's wishes. The spring flower income was only enough to cover wages, and the silkworms suffered a terrible loss. After autumn, first there was a severe drought, and the cotton and soybeans were scorched. The late rice produced white ears. After White Dew, it was hit by continuous autumn rain. The water level rose, and the rice stalks were broken and submerged in the water, all sprouting. The farmers worked hard all year round, but it all became nothing. The disaster is unprecedented in past years. With the disappointment of the autumn harvest, the farmers' livelihood has fallen into despair, and they have rushed to the township and town offices to report the disaster. Recently, the township and town offices of Cunshu, Chunfu, Dingqiao, Guodian, Yuanhua, and Boru have reported to the county government by telegram, requesting pity for the people's suffering and quickly sending personnel to inspect the townships, allowing the reduction or exemption of land taxes to relieve the people's hardship.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report from Xinpu on the 1st] Since the Haizhou salt-producing area was occupied by the Communist army for three-quarters, the salt tax revenue has suffered a great loss. Now, when the Communist army in northern Jiangsu is shaken, the Haizhou salt affairs authorities sent teams in two directions to advance into the Guanyun salt area on the 29th. The Communist army was unable to resist and retreated in disarray, carrying weapons and surrendering to our army. The Eastward Advancing Army recovered Zhuang such as Liuxin Zhangxu Bridge, and the Southward Advancing Army recovered Zhuang such as Zhang Yi Nong Su Zhuang. The salt field public office has sent personnel to the recovered salt area to comfort the salt workers and supervise the sweeping of the autumn salt to enrich the national tax revenue.</p>

According to Station Master Tang, the station has four recent tasks: (1) Soliciting winter clothing. In addition to asking the Suning Branch to handle it, it has also invited all sectors of society to launch a donation campaign. A portion of the donations has already been raised. (2) Distributing flour. It has been decided to distribute it on the 4th of this month. (3) Homecoming registration. A registration form has been drafted, which includes many items, divided into serial number, name, gender, age, detailed address of the original residence, current homecoming destination, how many li the journey is, how many days it will take to arrive, and the traffic situation along the way. After filling it out, the relief associations of each county will submit it to the relief station.

This matter is being urged by the county associations to be completed as soon as possible. (4) Improving the dormitories of various reception centers and adding doors, windows, and straw mats.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Large Sailboats Carry Lake Bandits to Surrender; Liao Bingnan's Troops Registered and Organized <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Suzhou Office] Since the gathering of Liao Bingnan's troops from the Taihu Lake platform at Three Mountains, the local pacification authorities here (i.e., the Taihu Lake Bandit Suppression Headquarters) dispatched staff officer Jin Jiarang, bringing uniforms and food, to Three Mountains. He led more than 150 surrendering personnel from Liao's troops, divided into ten large sailboats, which set sail at 2:00 PM on September 30th and arrived at Xukou at 11:00 PM that night. Staff officer Jiang Renjie and director Wan Zheng designated the troops to temporarily reside at the Xu Wang Temple and the Xukou Town Office. Registration and organization were scheduled to begin on October 1st.</p>
<p>[Report from our Wujiang Office] In various districts bordering this county, the reeds and rushes are not peaceful. The Taihu Lake bandit troubles have barely subsided, and bandits have risen along the eastern roads. Military police and local defense forces are exhausted from suppressing and chasing them. Recently, Li Defu, a former surplus officer from the Loyal Salvation Army, who had been stationed in the Luxu Beiku area for a long time and was very familiar with the local geography and personnel, gathered a gang of seventy or eighty people and turned to banditry. They occupied the Sanbaitang and Fenhu areas, robbing and looting, causing unrest in the villages every night. The county government decided to suppress them severely and, in addition to issuing orders to the local defense forces in each district to conduct joint patrols and encirclements, recently ordered Luo Yunlong, the captain of the Security Brigade, to lead a team to patrol the Chenhu area near Luxu on the border of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. They encountered the bandits, and five bandit boats opened fire to resist arrest. In a fierce battle lasting over an hour amidst gale-force winds and torrential rain, the bandits were eventually defeated and fled, leaving behind one bandit boat and capturing two bandits. One, Shen Shunfu, was the former town mayor of Beiku Town, and the other, Mei Zhenhua, the township head of Kuxi Township, was suspected of harboring bandits. Both were sent to the county government for legal action. He Nianchun, the district chief of Tongli, personally led a large team to patrol in order to defend the local area and prevent the bandits from fleeing into the district.</p>
<p>[Report from our Jiading Office] Wu Zhuyun, the main culprit in the 2.4 million yuan robbery of a car in this county's Lutang Town, was originally an unemployed vagrant. During the War of Resistance, he falsely claimed to be a guerrilla and committed atrocities. After the restoration of peace, he continued his evil ways and engaged in robberies everywhere. A month ago, he robbed money and bicycles on the Jia-Lou Road. After the incident, four accomplices, including Wu Xingjin, were captured. The bandit also privately engraved a seal of a certain troop, attempting to commit unlawful acts. On the evening of the 28th, he gathered Wu Daomin and five others in the Lu family residence in Zhao Lane Township, Luodian, again plotting unlawful acts. They were detected and captured, and a pistol and some bullets were found on the spot. They have been sent to the county for legal action.</p>
<p>[Report from our Jiaxing Office] Business shops and residences in various towns and villages under the county's jurisdiction and in the suburbs have repeatedly reported robberies. Although the authorities have stepped up strict arrests, few have been solved. On the night of the 28th, dozens of bandits armed with long and short weapons suddenly appeared in the ferry crossing of Daqiao Town. More than ten families, including the Cheng family in the village, were looted, losing a considerable amount of food, clothing, and legal tender. After more than two hours, they fled towards Xiangxi Township in Tangbei.</p>

<p>[Report from our Wuxi Office] Xu Xiang, an officer of the city defense command in this county, shielded opium and formed a gang to extort money. After the case was solved, he was sent to the Wuxi Command of the Capital Garrison Headquarters for interrogation. At 4:30 PM on the 30th, the military judge Pu Shizhen, Yin He, and staff officer Han Shujie of the headquarters formed a military tribunal and, after the interrogation, sentenced the main culprit Xu Xiang, a major in active service, to ten years of imprisonment in accordance with the regulations for punishing corruption. Six accomplices, including Cui Xiaoheshang, were transferred to the court for interrogation.</p>

<p>Black Market Tickets Sold in Front of the Railway Bureau</p>
<p>Yesterday, I returned to Changzhou from Shanghai. When I arrived at the North Railway Station to buy a ticket, they were sold out. At this time, a police officer was standing in front of the second-class ticket booth, peddling black market tickets. As a poor civil servant, I saw that the price of an ordinary ticket was more than double the original price. I questioned the police department of the Railway Bureau. I request that the police officer be severely punished to prevent this bad practice. This concerns the reputation of the police department and should not be ignored as a trivial matter. [Ben Fen]</p>
<p>Hygiene in Alleys Should Be Improved Quickly</p>
<p>Mr. Editor: Hygiene Bureau Director Zhang Wei said in response to a senator's question that some waste transport boats dump waste into the Huangpu River halfway, and that he is "planning to disguise himself to investigate." This shows Director Zhang's seriousness. However, I wonder if he is aware that we, who live in alleys without sanitation facilities, see sanitation workers pour most of the waste from chamber pots into the sewers every day. This hinders public hygiene. It would be best if the director could find a way to correct this, which would greatly benefit the citizens. (Li Shanyang)</p>
<p>Land Tax Deeds Should Not Be Like Excessive Levies</p>
<p>I am originally from Chuansha but live in Shanghai. Recently, I learned from my fellow villagers who came to Shanghai that the county government in my hometown has also begun to handle land property rights or transfer registration. I personally went to my hometown a few days ago to handle the transfer registration at the township office in my jurisdiction, paying 6% land deed tax, calculated at an estimated value of 350,000 per mu, plus a surcharge of slightly more than 2%, and an additional supervision fee of slightly more than 2%. The registration procedure must be handled indirectly by the township office, so a handling fee of as much as 5% must be paid when entrusting the office to handle it. In total, the fee to be paid is 15% of the estimated value, which is several times the announced payable value. Furthermore, various fees are arbitrarily created, which seems like excessive levies. The township office is actually a Bao-Tian institution, which takes advantage of the indirect registration to arbitrarily charge a handling fee of 5% of the value, which is suspected of raising fees under false pretenses, which is deeply regrettable for the people. I recently heard that a people's protection conference was convened in my hometown, which I am very pleased about. I take this opportunity to propose, for the convenience of fellow villagers in Shanghai, that they be allowed to directly apply to the county government for registration, in order to avoid blackmail and relieve the people's difficulties.

<p>May We Think of Farmers When We Eat</p>
<p>The need for loans is realistic, but there are no good results. Look at grain loans, which ended up leading to rising prices. Although a few petty officials and unscrupulous merchants were dealt with, how could they compensate for the losses of consumers across the country! As for agricultural loans, aren't they creating opportunities for evil forces to hoard or exploit high-interest rates? All poor farmers still sell their crops early or borrow at 30% interest. It was recently reported that agricultural loans will be held again. Instead of being nominal and ineffective, it would be better to purchase rice and grains and, when food is scarce, distribute them to poor farmers at the original price plus official interest. Wouldn't that be more practical! If a Constant Granary is established, it can also stabilize prices, which is even more practical, rather than loud thunder but no rain.</p>
<p>Farmers are both producers and consumers. How can the fledgling cooperative business resist the extravagant, money-worshipping merchants who repeatedly exploit them? Even if a portion of supplies is distributed by the government (sugar), no matter how much they rack their brains, the black market remains. They do not think of using the Baojia system for distribution. Therefore, high prices are the farmer's fatal wound. When farmers are under the high pressure of life, they need blood transfusions. Otherwise, if government orders are distorted, popular resentment will boil over, creating a good opportunity for rebellious elements, which will deeply conceal the hidden dangers in the safe and secure areas. Every word of "seven points politics" shows that improving the lives of farmers is the main topic of administration. I hope that those in power will think of farmers when they "eat"! (Pan Baoyi)</p>
<h3 id="e51">Zhang Junmai's Opinions on the Current Situation (Continued from Page 2) <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>(B) Political Issues: The civil war problem should be resolved in the manner described above. Regarding the statement by Administrative Director Wu that "various parties and factions intend to refuse to participate in the National Assembly," it must also be explained that other parties and factions cannot participate in the National Assembly under the current state of war because such a National Assembly would certainly be unilateral. The Central Government has its National Assembly, and Yan'an has its People's Congress. If other parties participate, it is equivalent to participating in the civil war. The incessant civil wars of the past thirty or forty years have caused everyone heartache. We always hoped that after the end of the War of Resistance against Japan, the entire country would unite as one and engage in reconstruction. Therefore, in late April, I advocated postponing the National Assembly because I wanted to preserve this mechanism to achieve national unity. If the Central Government and the CCP each convene their own National Assembly, and other parties participate in either, it is equivalent to helping A fight B, or helping B fight A. We do not want this phenomenon to continue to occur in the future, so we strongly advocate a unified constitution and a unified National Assembly to create national unity. If the Central Government usually calls for unity, why should it insist on unilaterally convening the National Assembly this time? I think this approach is contrary to its usual advocacy of unity. Chairman Chiang usually considers himself responsible for resisting Japan and building the country. To create a divided country after eight years of the War of Resistance is certainly not what Chairman Chiang wants. Therefore, we advocate a ceasefire first. After the ceasefire, all parties and factions can naturally unite and cooperate in national reconstruction. If the ceasefire problem mentioned above can be resolved, the harmonious atmosphere in the Political Consultative Conference since January will not be difficult to restore.</p>
<p>The so-called political issues are no more than three: 1. the National Government, 2. the National Assembly, and 3. the draft constitution. 1. Let us first talk about the draft constitution. In March and April, the five parties showed no significant differences on the draft constitution in the constitutional drafting committee, so a consensus was reached. Although some parts were not completed, 80% was established. On the last day, the CCP once stood up to explain, "This is a record and not a draft," but we know that the reason they said this was because there was a decision to convene the National Assembly in mid-May, and the CCP had not yet decided to participate. If there is a National Assembly that the CCP does not participate in, and this draft constitution is taken out and said to be approved by the CCP, the CCP is afraid of such a situation, so it specifically stated that this is a record and not a draft. As for the points that everyone had already agreed on at the time, I think the CCP still recognizes them now and will not deny them. If a week or two more effort is put into the draft constitution, it can certainly be completed and, according to the agreement at the time, used as the only draft constitution. Each party would restrain its members and be responsible for passing it. I think there is no difficulty in completing the draft constitution.</p>
<p>2. Regarding the National Assembly issue, friends heard from the Central Government that it seems that the Central Government always suspects that the CCP does not intend to participate in the National Assembly. In our contact since the Political Consultative Conference, we do not feel that the CCP does not want a unified National Assembly or constitution. As long as the Central Government agrees to a ceasefire, the CCP will not find it difficult to express its participation in the National Assembly. As for the number of National Assembly delegates, it can be discussed according to the proportion of three-quarters and a little more than one-quarter, and there will certainly be no major difficulties.</p>
<p>3. The reorganization of the National Government involves several issues: (1) The so-called fourteen seats issue. Originally, the so-called government should be organized by people with the same opinions and policies. The government should be a unit with consistent internal opinions. The Political Consultative Conference decided that the Democratic League and the CCP should occupy fourteen seats, as if assuming that the Kuomintang is on one side and the Democratic League and the CCP are on the other side. This creates a situation of two opposing sides. The reason for this veto power at the time was that people outside the party were afraid of three things: 1. civil war, 2. damaging the people's fundamental rights, and 3. continuing to maintain one-party dictatorship in finance, military affairs, and culture. If the Central Government can change its usual practice and devote itself to peaceful construction, and exercise the laws and administration of the country with a fair spirit, not to mention that the Democratic League can be consistent with the Kuomintang, even the CCP can be consistent with the Kuomintang. Therefore, the fourteen seats issue should not be taken as a difficult problem in the government. Just ask whether its policies are democratic. If the government can avoid one-party dictatorship, all parties and factions will certainly not make things difficult for the government or oppose the Kuomintang in the government. (2) In addition to the fourteen seats in the National Government, there is also the issue of the reorganization of the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan is the executive organ, and the National Government Committee is the decision-making organ, so the real power of administration is in the Executive Yuan, not in the National Government. If the current Executive Yuan is not reorganized and is to be reorganized after the constitution is promulgated, I am afraid that the reorganization of the Executive Yuan will be more than a year away. Because from now on, it will take at least three or four months to convene the National Assembly to discuss the constitution, and elections will be held within six months after the constitution is promulgated, so it can be seen that the implementation of the constitution will be at least one month later. If the list of National Government Committee members in the coalition government is decided before the National Assembly is convened, and the Executive Yuan, which bears the actual responsibility for administration, is to be reorganized ten months later, I am afraid that it will be too contrary to the intention of refreshing the world's eyes and ears, which will certainly not satisfy the people of the whole country. Therefore, in our view, the reorganization of the National Government and the Executive Yuan are not two problems but one problem.</p>
<p>From the above discussion of the ceasefire and political issues, if the government immediately ceases fire, negotiations on political issues can certainly be completed in a harmonious atmosphere. Therefore, we are willing to assist the government from the perspective of unity. If it does not take this path and still convenes the National Assembly unilaterally, then there will certainly be three results: (1) The unilateral National Assembly will make it impossible for all parties to participate, (2) Yan'an will certainly convene a People's Congress in the liberated areas, promoting a split in China, and (3) After our internal division, the Soviet Union will take North China as a base, and the United States will take South China as a base. Because of our division, the confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union in the Far East will be promoted even more. A few days ago, a foreigner came to talk and made a profound impression on me. He said, "A divided China is the beginning of the Third World War." I have such a future picture in my mind, so I often have a sense of trepidation, so I strongly hope that the government will cease fire first, and then discuss political issues to achieve China's unity, and create a unified China from a unified National Assembly and a unified constitution. This is the only hope of our Democratic Socialist Party.</p>

<p>[US News Service, Washington, dated 1st] Former Secretary of State Hull, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, suddenly suffered a stroke on the eve of his 75th birthday and was rushed to the Washington Naval Hospital for treatment. According to people in the hospital, his condition is quite serious.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, dated 1st] Former US Secretary of State Hull, who is seriously ill, issued a statement from his sickbed today, calling on the great powers to cooperate in this most dangerous moment in history. Hull said that although there are various dangerous disputes among the countries that won World War II, their existence is the right path to peace and security, and there is absolutely no reason to hesitate or doubt this. I believe that all countries must base their relations on a major fact, that is, the main interest of each country is also tied to ensuring security in a peaceful world, and to promoting the economy and prosperity of their people in this world. The great powers must restore the unity they lacked during the war. Since the darkest period of the war, the need for cooperation between the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, China, and France has never been greater than it is today. These countries still have a special responsibility to jointly exercise their global leadership, both within and outside the United Nations and other international institutions, to promote the unity and cooperation of all countries.</p>

<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Paris, 2nd (Emergency Broadcast from Nuremberg): The main German war criminals sentenced to death by the Nuremberg International Tribunal will be executed by hanging in Nuremberg.</p>
<p>Göring and Jodl, through their lawyers, have indirectly requested the Four-Power Control Council to be spared the dishonorable hanging and to be granted execution by a military firing squad instead. Although Keitel has expressed indifference as to how he dies, his lawyer has also made the same request on his behalf. The executions will be held inside Nuremberg Prison.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nuremberg, 2nd] The eleven Nazi war criminals sentenced to death by the International Tribunal are scheduled to be executed on the 16th of this month. The execution will not be public; only eight Allied journalists will be allowed to attend. The journalists have decided to issue a unified report, to be translated into three or four languages and published in various countries. It is also learned that former Ambassador to Turkey, Papen, and former Nazi radio propagandist, Fritzsche, were acquitted yesterday by the International Military Tribunal. However, as their accommodations have not yet been arranged, they spent last night in prison as "guests of the Americans." According to Schacht's German defense lawyer, Dix, speaking to a reporter from this agency, Schacht has not faced any risks thus far. However, risks may arise today, as some Germans may attack Schacht.</p>

Neurath served as Governor of Bohemia and Moravia after the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, during which the German Gestapo brutally murdered many Czech patriots.</p>
<p>The Rumor of Papen Becoming President of Germany</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hanfort City, Germany, 2nd] A rumor is circulating here among Germans and British, stating that a new government will soon be formed in the British and American occupation zones of Germany, headed by the three former government officials acquitted yesterday by the Nuremberg Tribunal. According to the rumor, Papen will be President, Schacht will be Finance Minister, and Fritzsche will be Minister of Propaganda. It is said that the peace issue in Europe might be resolved due to the release of these three individuals.</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Paris, 2nd (Broadcast from Nuremberg): Even Schacht's defense lawyer, Dr. Jelis, expressed extreme surprise at Schacht's acquittal, stating that it was completely unexpected. He also said that while the verdict was generally fair, it was unfair to some defendants. For example, Keitel's crimes were no more serious than Dönitz's, yet Dönitz was sentenced to ten years in prison, while Keitel was sentenced to hanging.</p>
<p>Schacht Misses His Wife and Children</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nuremberg, 1st] Former Minister of Economics and President of the Reichsbank, Schacht, was very pleased after his release. He told a reporter from this agency that the prosecutor himself understood that serious crimes should not be attributed to him. He stated that during the war, he often fought against the war, so he was confident that the court would eventually release him. He hopes to see his wife and two sons soon. When the reporter asked him about his thoughts on the court's verdict, Schacht replied that some verdicts were quite fair, but others were excessively harsh. When asked about his future plans, Schacht replied that he hoped to return home immediately and never see reporters again. When several people asked Schacht for his autograph, he smiled and said, "My two sons haven't eaten chocolate for two years. If you can give my sons candy, then I will sign for you."</p>
<p>Where Will Papen Go?</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Paris, 2nd (Broadcast from Nuremberg): Papen's son, Franz Papen, has requested the authorities in the French occupation zone to issue a pass and necessary documents so that his father can enter the French occupation zone. However, it is unlikely that permission will be granted for him to enter the French occupation zone. Papen's only way out is to go to his daughter in the British occupation zone. His daughter, who is 23 years old, resides in Hamburg.</p>

<p>Song Yu, Reporting from Paris:</p>
<p>It's over. According to a veteran French student, during the German occupation, all industries in France were in decline. The word "National" (originally meaning domestic or domestically produced) in the French language had almost become a synonym for shoddy goods, similar to the meaning of the word "Russian" after the Russian Revolution in Chinese. For example, ordering a "National" coffee or going to a "National" restaurant meant getting the cheapest stuff. But in the year since the collapse of Germany, the use of this word has gradually decreased and been forgotten, which also shows that France is gradually</p>
<p>regaining its confidence. The French are naturally optimistic and never forget to have fun anytime, anywhere. In this war, France suffered far more injuries and pain than Britain, but today, people traveling in France can no longer see the scars of the war. When someone mentions it, it seems like a distant memory rather than a painful and visceral reality. This is completely different from the situation in Britain. In London, you can't help but be reminded by people or things that the war has just ended and everything is being revived and rebuilt. Once, a reporter took a train from Paris to the countryside for fun, sitting in third class, which was quite crowded. Most passengers couldn't find seats and had to stand in the car, but the people standing didn't seem to mind the crowding and took the opportunity to tease and joke with each other. Later, when the train arrived at Xiang Jiyang, two more young couples got on, also squeezing into the crowd. Soon, they took out harmonicas and started playing, and gradually some people started singing along. Eventually, almost the entire car responded, and as the singing subsided, the teasing followed. The entire car immediately turned into a mass song and entertainment party. This kind of</p>
<p>extravagant enjoyment is rarely seen in Britain. The British always keep a straight face, looking gloomy and quietly focusing on hard work. If you talk to them, they will tell you how great Britain's losses were during the war and how arduous and urgent the recovery work is. Sometimes, it makes people impatient and can't help but ask them how much responsibility Britain shouldered in the entire war. Once, a reporter went to the Luxembourg Palace to attend the European Peace Conference and found two journalists in the palace's attached bar, drinking while recording the speeches from the radio. When they had a moment, they would take a few sips of wine. This kind of working without forgetting to have fun can probably only be seen in France. Speaking of drinking, reminds the reporter of another thing. Wine and perfume are both special products of France. Champagne, brandy, and wine are all most famous when produced in France. But the amount of wine consumed in France itself is also considerable. Ordinary restaurants always have wine with every meal. Whether you drink it or not, the wine bill is included in the meal bill, as if you have already drunk it. Coffee, on the other hand, is charged separately. In slightly more luxurious restaurants or dance halls, opening multiple bottles of champagne is used as a sign of wealth. For those of us who are not used to drinking, having to pay for wine with every meal is a bit wasteful. Once, I casually mentioned to a Frenchman that having wine with every meal in restaurants seems wasteful for people who don't drink. He said, "What's wasteful?</p>
<p>Everyone in France drinks wine." What he said was probably true. People who don't drink wine are doomed to lose money when they go to France. The French love beauty, so art and literature are particularly developed. Even now, when the economy is difficult, they still spare no expense to decorate and beautify. For example, there are many stone statues and churches in Paris, and every night when the lights come on, they illuminate these artistic masterpieces from various angles, so that their beauty is fully revealed, and passersby have the opportunity to fully appreciate them. Therefore, the lights are often on all night long. Paris has many such artistic achievements, and the cost of electricity must be greatly increased, but the French do not see this as a hardship, but as an honor. In contrast, Britain prioritizes economy everywhere. Even today, only one-third of London's streetlights are allowed to be turned on, and decorative lights are not allowed to be turned on at all. In June, for the Victory Day celebration, the arc lights around the statues around Buckingham Palace were turned on for a week, which was considered a major event in Britain. People from all over came to watch the spectacle, and the streets were almost crowded. From an economic point of view, this is naturally excellent, but from the point of view of enjoying life, it feels a bit stingy. Life in Eastern Europe is extremely difficult now. Many artists cannot make a living in their own countries and have fled to France in search of a way out. Every evening at sunset, along the banks of the Seine, you can see ragged artists selling paintings and singing. A friend pointed out to me that many of them had fled from Hungary. The reason why they are willing to stay in Paris is probably not just the proximity of the water and the geographical proximity, but also because only in Paris can they find patrons and find a paradise for artists at the end of their road.</p>

<p>The government authorities have decided to compensate for wartime ship losses. The measures were telegraphed yesterday by the Ministry of Communications to the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau for implementation: (1) For those requisitioned for military use or for blocking projects, cash compensation will be made in accordance with the provisions of the Military Requisition Law, plus a profit of 5% weekly interest. The compensation standard will be based on the ship value reported at the time of ship registration. The compensation may be calculated based on price indexes and depreciation due to the age of the ship. The compensation obtained must be used for the purpose of building ships; otherwise, the compensation will be recovered. For requisitioned ships with no registered ship value or incomplete registration documents, the Ministry of Communications will hire experts to form a compensation assessment committee to assess the value. (2) For those damaged by the enemy during military or official missions and unable to be recovered, or if recovered but unusable, the government will provide cash compensation. If they can be salvaged and repaired for use, compensation will be provided for the salvage and repair costs. (3) Commercial ships damaged during the war may apply to the government for loans. According to the results of the Shipping Administration Bureau's investigation, a total of 92 ships, totaling 130,597 tons, were requisitioned by the government during the war to block blockade lines and were damaged in military or official missions. The government will fully compensate for these ships. The remaining 316 ships damaged during the war, totaling more than 166,500 tons, will be provided with loans by the government for relief based on the actual situation.</p>

<p>Military traitor Shi Yaomin, originally from Yixing, Jiangsu, 39 years old, defected to the enemy. During the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, he was ordered to infiltrate the 63rd Division of the puppet army for counter-propaganda work. Unexpectedly, the criminal was enticed by generous rewards and defected to the enemy. Together with his subordinates, Fan Jin, Zhou Wenbin, and other traitors, he killed underground comrades, destroyed Jiang Bocheng's secret radio station in Shanghai, killed three Shanghai action personnel, including Zhang Fei, and led the enemy to attack Changyu and other places in Yixing. After the victory, he was arrested by military authorities. The criminal was executed yesterday in Song Park.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Yan Qingxiang, General Manager of Cotton Mill, Continued to be Tried Yesterday for Suspected Collaboration; Indictment Lists Four Charges; Li Hanqing Sentenced to Five Years in Prison <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Yan Qingxiang, 48 years old, from Shanghai, General Manager of the Su Lun Cotton Mill in Suzhou, was accused of being a traitor. During the investigation by the High Prosecutor's Office, he was allowed to be released on bail with a cash guarantee of 20 million yuan. After formal indictment, the High Court conducted a preliminary hearing on August 19. After investigation, the court considered the charges to be serious and ordered him to be detained again in court. The court continued the trial yesterday afternoon. After questioning, it was ordered to reschedule the hearing.</p>
<p>The charges listed in the indictment can be roughly divided into four points: (1) He served as a consultant to the puppet Ministry of Industry and Commerce. (2) He procured textiles and yarn for the enemy army on behalf of the "China-Japan Trade Federation." (3) He served as a supervisor of the puppet Cotton Control Committee. (4) In the spring of the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1945], he attended the puppet National People's Congress in the name of Yan Ji, a representative from Jiangsu Province. The defendant's testimony in court yesterday was largely the same as last time. He stated that after the enemy occupied Suzhou in the winter of the 26th year [i.e. 1937], the Su Lun Cotton Mill was taken over and managed by the enemy's Inland and Foreign Cotton Yarn Mill. During that time, the puppet Restoration Government invited him to serve as the Director of the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction, but he declined. Later, Wu Yanong obtained a letter of appointment as a consultant from the puppet Ministry of Industry and Commerce through deception. The Shanghai office of the ministry negotiated with the enemy's Asia Development Board, and he was able to recover the cotton mill in March of the 30th year [i.e. 1941]. However, the title of the puppet position was fictitious. He requested the court to investigate whether the puppet Ministry of Industry and Commerce had such a title in its organizational structure. The Cotton Control Committee was established in the autumn of the 30th year [i.e. 1941] by the cotton mill associations of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. Its purpose was purely to facilitate unified procurement, purchase, and distribution, and it had nothing to do with the puppet Commercial Control Committee. He was elected as a supervisor and requested to resign, so he never went. In the summer of the 33rd year [i.e. 1944], the enemy army planned to destroy the non-operational machines and use the iron for military needs. After discussions by the cotton mill associations of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, each cotton mill weaved textiles and yarn for the "China-Japan Trade Federation" to avoid damage to the machines. The Su Lun Cotton Mill was assigned 300 bales of cotton yarn and 14,880 pieces of cloth. The raw materials were supplied by the association, the electricity was allocated by the association, and the wages were also issued by the association. The batch of textiles was originally scheduled to be delivered in the 33rd year [i.e. 1944], but the delivery was delayed until July of the 34th year [i.e. 1945], when it was still not fully delivered. After the victory, the goods were transferred to the Suzhou Office of the Central Trust Bureau on March 11 of this year. Regarding the matter of being a representative of the puppet Jiangsu Province, in the spring of the 34th year [i.e. 1945], the puppet National People's Congress was held in Nanjing. At that time, the defendant lived in Suzhou. Ren Yuandao, the puppet governor of Jiangsu Province, sent someone to invite him to attend. Because there was a radio transmitter of the 25th Army Group at his home, he feared being implicated. Under their coercion, he attended the opening day in the name of Yan Ji. He returned to Suzhou the next day due to illness, etc. Yesterday, Yan was wearing a gray long gown, black leather shoes, and Western-style trousers. He wore glasses and had shaved off his long beard. After the court session, he was returned to Zhongjian Prison.</p>
<p>Li Hanqing, the Director of the Puppet Jiangsu Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Tax Collection Office, was sentenced to five years of imprisonment by the High Court yesterday, with five years of deprivation of civil rights. All of his property was confiscated, except for the necessary living expenses for his family. In addition, the case of Hungarian Yilizi, accused of providing alcohol to the enemy, was investigated and rescheduled for another hearing.</p>

<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Zhou Bangjun, the former General Manager of China-West Pharmaceutical Company, who has already been sentenced to three years of imprisonment for collaborating with the enemy, is currently detained in Shanghai Prison. Yesterday afternoon, at the request of the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau, the High Court brought Zhou from prison to investigate his assets. He was asked whether the China United Pharmaceutical Research Institute, located in the Minyi Amusement Park on Xinzha Road in this city, belonged to him. Zhou replied that the institute was jointly established by his eldest son, Zhou Wentong, and several classmates. The capital was small, and it was purely for research purposes. He usually did not advise them. He was then escorted back to prison by the bailiffs.</p>

<p>Social Affairs Bureau Calls for Discussion Today</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, following Mayor Wu's instructions, will first evaluate the prices of cotton cloth and woolen thread. Cotton cloth and woolen thread are needed by the general public, and their current fluctuations are quite large, which affects people's lives. The bureau decided to convene the heads of the cotton cloth and woolen thread trade associations and representatives of several manufacturers this morning to discuss the evaluation of cotton cloth and woolen thread prices. It is said that the organization of the evaluation committee will be discussed first.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Branch of the China Industrial Association, with the approval of the Ministry of Social Affairs, has provided detailed explanations regarding labor-management issues. The key points are excerpted below: (1) Regarding the issue of workers' treatment, the ministry has formulated "Measures for Wage Adjustment in Private Enterprises during the Post-Rehabilitation Period," which adjusts wages based on the base-period wage and the workers' cost-of-living index. However, for wages with a base period of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1937], those exceeding 50 yuan may be issued with a reduced percentage. Furthermore, when adjusting or after adjusting wages in various industries in accordance with these measures, if the production and operating conditions are not good and it is indeed not possible to pay wages according to the workers' cost-of-living index, the reduction in wages may be determined through labor-management consultation or by the arbitration committee. (2) Regarding the issue of workers' right to strike, the law has strict restrictions on workers' right to strike. (3) Workers are not allowed to interfere with the factory's management rights under any pretext. The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau is ordered to strictly prohibit this. However, to promote labor-management coordination and increase production efficiency, factory meetings should be held in accordance with the provisions of the Factory Law.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Participating in the Investigation Team: Five Councilors Hold a Symposium and Publish a Report to Speakers Pan and Xu <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] City Councilors Zhao Junhao, He Yuanming, Wu Jian'e, Zhu Xuefan, and Ma Junshuo have only attended several routine meetings since being recommended to participate in the work of the Investigation Team. All the work of the team had already commenced, and had been assigned to several committee members. After they joined the team, they only participated in discussions regarding the Municipal Government's acceptance of enemy and puppet automobiles, which were allocated to Wan Tai for discounted repairs, and the Municipal Government's disposal of materials from the puppet Central Market. There were no other cases assigned to them, causing the representatives to deeply feel that they had not been able to achieve any performance in their work since joining the team. The five councilors held a symposium yesterday and published a report to Speaker Pan Gongzhan and Deputy Speaker Xu Jiquan. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Allegations are Inaccurate</p>
<p>"We joined the Investigation Team for the Reception and Handling of Enemy and Puppet Materials in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Regions. On September 21st, we submitted a report to the meeting. Now that the team has concluded its work, we are submitting the following supplementary report: (1) Regarding the process of being assigned to participate in the Investigation Team's work: We accepted our appointment to the team, recognizing the importance of the mission. During the first meeting, we unanimously stated our hope that the team would provide specific instructions for cases that had already been handled, and that Director Zhang would assign work for unfinished cases. At that time, Director Zhang only brought up the Municipal Government's acceptance of enemy and puppet automobiles, which were allocated to Wan Tai for discounted repairs, and the Municipal Government's disposal of materials from the puppet Central Market. No other matters were mentioned, and all other work had already been assigned to other committee members. Therefore, we had no way to start. No other cases were brought up during the second and third meetings either. (2) Regarding the Puppet Central Market case: This case was decided to be transferred to the court for handling during a routine meeting on September 18th. Director Zhang designated Jian'e, Yuanming, and Junshuo to research the legal and accounting aspects and formulate opinions. Jian'e and Junshuo believed that the nature of this case was mostly related to administrative penalties. Yuanming originally intended to investigate the accounts, but all the accounts had already been sent to the Audit Office for review, making it impossible to access them. Subsequently, at a continued meeting on September 27th, we formally presented an oral report, and all attending committee members unanimously resolved to make a final decision on this case, which was recorded in the minutes. The reports stating that we 'undertook a thorough investigation but received no response' and that 'the written opinion has not been submitted to this day' are completely inconsistent with the facts. The contents of this case will be officially announced by the Investigation Team in the future."</p>
<p>Zhang Zhiben Issues a Statement</p>
<p>Furthermore, Director Zhang Zhiben of the Investigation Team was quite surprised to read in several newspapers the previous day that city councilors had joined the Investigation Team but had no work to do, and that Director Zhang had supposedly entrusted a case of the Central Market for thorough investigation, but no results had been seen, etc. Yesterday, he specifically stated to the representatives that this was not the case. He had not been to the team's office on Monday afternoon of this week, nor had he ever stated the aforementioned matters to reporters. He urged the representatives not to misunderstand.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Former Governor-General of Hong Kong Isoya Rensuke and Governor-General of Taiwan Tani Hisao were requested by the Chinese government to be extradited and brought to trial from the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers in Japan after the victory. On August 1st of this year, a special plane was dispatched from Japan to escort them to Shanghai, where they were imprisoned in the Shanghai Prison War Criminals Detention Center. At 4:20 PM yesterday, personnel from the First Pacification Area Military Tribunal went to the Shanghai Prison to take the two men and escorted them to Nanjing by night train. They will be publicly tried in Nanjing in the near future.</p>
<p>Changshu and Hangzhou Thoroughly Collect Evidence of War Crimes</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The First Pacification Area Military Tribunal, in order to thoroughly investigate the crimes of Mura Haruki, who murdered twenty-six patriotic martyrs in Yutai, and Shiba Hirao, who raped hundreds of women, specially dispatched the chief clerk of the tribunal, Li Yechu, to Changshu and Hangzhou via Nanjing, after escorting the war criminals Isoya and Tani to Nanjing, to collect evidence and accept reports from the local people.</p>
<p>Yuan Sheng Flour Mill Hoarding Flour; Social Bureau Conducts Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>Recently, the price of flour in the city has increased from 14,000 yuan to 17,000 yuan per bag. This kind of fluctuation is improper. Mayor Wu has already given earnest advice during a meeting with various trade associations a few days ago, and ordered the Social Bureau to instruct the flour industry association to notify all flour mills not to raise prices. Violators will be severely punished. Most flour mills have complied, and flour prices have begun to fall. However, it was discovered yesterday that Yuan Sheng Flour Mill at No. 290 Wusong Road violated the order by selling on the black market for exorbitant profits, falsely claiming to customers that there was no flour available. An investigation revealed that the mill had stockpiled as many as 1,465 bags of flour. In addition to detaining the flour, the Municipal Government has ordered the Social Bureau to conduct a thorough investigation and report the findings for further action.</p>

<p>The Chinese Architectural Society, founded in 1927, is a national technical research organization. Its members are all famous architects in the country. During the war, the society's headquarters moved west to Chongqing and continued to promote various businesses. After the victory, the society's headquarters moved back to the capital and earnestly reorganized its affairs, recruited new members, and complied with the laws and regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs. Members who did not go to the rear during the war must reapply for membership, otherwise their membership would be revoked. In addition to setting up a headquarters in Nanjing, the society also re-established a branch in Shanghai. Currently, there are eighty members. It is learned that the council meeting of the society has resolved to hold the society's 35th annual meeting at 9:00 AM on the 5th (Saturday) in the auditorium on the fourth floor of the Bank of China Building at No. 23 The Bund, Shanghai. In addition to discussing business rules, draft architectural regulations, architectural education, and other issues, there will also be speeches on urban planning, the current situation of European and American architecture, low-income housing and residential spaces, etc. In addition, directors, supervisors, and staff will be elected, and a new member induction ceremony will be held. An evening social gathering will also be held. This annual meeting of the society is the first grand event after the victory, and it coincides with the beginning of my country's construction, which is of profound significance.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Gas Company is currently encountering great difficulties. The quality of coal allocated to the company by the Fuel Management Committee is deteriorating, which is greatly affecting production. It is heard that the Public Utilities Bureau is trying to procure coal of better quality on behalf of the company. The company urges all users to conserve to the minimum extent possible. The current gas limit is 45 degrees per household, which is 4,500 cubic feet. For the time being, the limit will not be reduced.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Wear Short Clothes, Eat Brown Rice, Walk, and Send Simple Gifts: Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Drafts Thrift Regulations for Merchants <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Thrift Movement Committee previously resolved to send separate letters to various organizations to draft thrift regulations individually. It has successively received various draft thrift regulations from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Municipal Agricultural Association, Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Municipal Education Association, Municipal Women's Association, etc., which have been transferred to the Social Bureau, filed separately, and the relevant organizations have been notified to earnestly implement them. It is learned that the thrift regulations for merchants drafted by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce are as follows: (1) Clothing: The principle is not to make new clothes. Advocate short clothes, such as Zhongshan suits, student uniforms, youth uniforms, etc., which can reduce the use of clothing materials and invigorate the spirit. However, they must be washed frequently to maintain cleanliness. (2) Diet: Eating fatty and fresh foods every day does not supplement health. Eating more vegetables, plain tea, and simple meals is very hygienic. Brown rice is rich in nutrients and contains abundant vitamin B, and it is also more filling, so it should be vigorously promoted. In addition, proper banquets should be limited to ten people per table, four dishes and four bowls, one snack, and one soup. (3) Housing: The urban population is concentrated, and housing is difficult. The dispersal should be promoted, and people should move to the suburbs and Pudong, etc., which can avoid the suffering of overcrowding and have sufficient sunlight and air, which can greatly improve health and reduce disease and fatigue. Fire accidents are also an important way to save money. (4) Walking: For daily work, if the journey is not very far, you can walk. In addition, you can take a tram or have your own bicycle is best, which can exercise the body, save time and money, develop working habits, and change social atmosphere. (5) Other: Everything should be based on thrift, and extravagance should be avoided. For example, in interpersonal relations, regardless of weddings, funerals, or celebrations, all proper gifts should be limited to 10,000 legal tender. All should be in cash to ensure practical use. We must ensure that everyone is diligent and thrifty, then the restoration of industry and commerce can be expected soon, and the national construction work will surely be completed soon.</p>
<h3 id="e82">British Tram Company to Restore Two Trolleybus Lines <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The vehicles owned by the British Tram Company were severely damaged during the enemy and puppet period. At that time, overseas transportation was blocked, and all tram parts and tires could not be purchased. Therefore, new tram and trolleybus vehicles have disappeared in recent years, and old vehicles are becoming less and less day by day. After the victory, the city's population has increased sharply, and public transportation is extremely congested. The company has purchased 600 new tires from abroad, and 180 tires have arrived in Shanghai and are stored in warehouses. The old vehicles will be repaired and assembled soon, and the No. 20 and No. 18 trolleybus lines will be restored first. Line 20 runs between Jing'an Temple, Fuzhou Road, and the Bund, and Line 18 runs between the North Railway Station and Xieqiao, because these two lines are the most congested with passengers, which is intended to alleviate the situation slightly.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The unregistered shantytowns made of grass and wood near Lujiabang Road and Huining Road in Nanshi are densely packed. At around 2:15 PM yesterday, a fire broke out due to carelessness, burning down twenty-one houses in an instant. The fire was extinguished by the fire department, which dispatched vehicles to the scene. The arsonist has fled and is at large. The police are currently investigating.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Recent Activities of the Red Cross: Setting Up Free Clinics for the Poor, Distributing Winter Clothing, Establishing Children's Nutrition Stations, and Evening Remedial Classes <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] The name of the Red Cross is familiar to the public, but the origin, organization, nature, and mission of the Red Cross have not been widely noticed. Why do all countries in the world have Red Cross societies? And why are the flags all white with a red cross? Who was the first to raise this banner?</p>
<p>The Red Cross originated in Geneva, Switzerland. In 1859, Swiss man Henry Dunant returned to his country from North Africa. He passed through the battlefield of Solferino during the Italo-French War. He witnessed the battlefield full of dead and wounded, groaning and wailing, blood spilling over the fields, which was extremely tragic. He specially mobilized the nearby people and passing merchants to jointly provide relief, comforting the wounded and burying the dead. Afterwards, he traveled to various European countries to promote his idea of saving the dying and healing the wounded. After several international conferences were convened and international conventions were signed, Red Cross societies were established in various countries. Representatives of various countries, in order to express their respect for Switzerland, specially stipulated the reverse of the Swiss flag – white with a red cross – as the symbol for saving the wounded and sick. Since then, the white flag with a red cross has represented the noble ideals of universal love, peace, and serving society. Because the Red Cross flag flies wherever countless people are rescued, the Red Cross symbol is increasingly respected. According to a 1939 survey, there were Red Cross societies in sixty-one countries around the world, with hundreds of millions of members, which means that one out of every thirty people is a member of the Red Cross. The Chinese Red Cross Society was originally one of them. It was established in 1904 during the Russo-Japanese War, and has a history of forty-two years. However, in the past, due to various limitations and insufficient publicity, very few people formally joined as members. After the restoration, the Red Cross executives who returned to Shanghai made efforts to solicit members. Now, in Shanghai alone, the number of members has expanded to 60,000. However, this number is considered too small by the heads of the American Red Cross. In New York City, more than half of the citizens are members of the Red Cross.</p>
<p>Each country's Red Cross has its branches, ranging from dozens to thousands. Our Chinese Red Cross had 512 branches before the war. During the Anti-Japanese War, they suffered from the enemy and puppets' mutilation, annihilation, or loss of contact. The losses were extremely huge. About 70 branches have successively returned. It is expected that the number of branches will increase by at least four or five times in the following year.</p>
<p>The Red Cross is a folk service organization. Its former mission was "Universal Love, Caring for Soldiers, Saving the Dying, and Healing the Wounded." Now its mission has expanded. It not only provides rescue during wartime, but also promotes social service work in peacetime. It is the savior of the poor and sick. But unfortunately, in Shanghai, there is only one Red Cross society that truly serves the poor and sick, which is located at No. 856 Xinzha Road, in an old-fashioned, dilapidated house.</p>
<p>The general secretary of the society is Gu Xinpu. The main responsible persons include Executive Tong Xingxingmen, Executive and Service Section Chief Wang Wan, and others. They are all a group of people who dedicate their lives to social service and work silently. Currently, they are carrying out many charitable activities, of which the most important are the following four tasks: (1) Free Medical Clinics for the Poor - Only a registration fee of 200 yuan is charged, and a follow-up visit is 100 yuan. Medicines are free. About three to four hundred people seek treatment every day, with surgical cases accounting for the majority, and Dr. Wang Renhou Song Sheng personally diagnoses and treats them in the clinic. (2) Children's Nutrition Station - The society independently prepares 300 boxes of fresh milk. In addition to regularly distributing it to patients with lung diseases and malnutrition (must be certified by the society's doctor) for free drinking, a children's nutrition service station is specially established. Every day from 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM, diluted milk is provided free of charge. About 400 poor children go to drink every day. (3) Distribution of Winter Clothing - The society received a large number of relief winter clothing from the American Red Cross, including 900 pairs of boys' pants, 195 woolen sweaters, 400 cloth pajamas, and sets of girls' tops and triangular pants. In addition, there are 600 packages of infant supplies. Because these relief clothes are too elaborate, for example, the contents of the infant supplies packages are all brand-new flannel materials, including diapers, blankets, pajamas, coats, etc., which even middle- and upper-class Chinese children can hardly enjoy. Therefore, this makes it difficult for the personnel responsible for the distribution. If they are distributed to the extremely poor, they are afraid that they will not even know how to use them, and even more afraid that they will resell them in the market, which will affect the reputation of the Chinese Red Cross. Therefore, they have spent a lot of thought and gone through a lot of procedures in selecting the recipients. In addition to entrusting various hospitals in the city to distribute them according to actual needs, there are still some remaining. They must ensure that they are distributed to those who really need them. (4) Evening Remedial Classes - The original purpose of the establishment was to provide young members, such as apprentices, with the opportunity to make up for their studies in their spare time. However, as a result, out-of-school children accounted for the majority. This semester, tuition fees have skyrocketed, and the children of ordinary working-class families cannot afford to continue their studies. In addition to only being able to sigh at the school gate, the desire for knowledge led them to find this place. After paying a registration fee of 2,000 yuan, they can make up for their studies for two hours every night. Textbook fees and miscellaneous fees are all free. The teachers are all volunteers and only receive 50,000 to 60,000 yuan for transportation expenses. Because there are many people who want to enroll, the society has used the office and waiting room as temporary classrooms.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang, the chief of the Service Section of the society, told reporters: Seeing the large number of poor people in China who need help, there should be at least ten pure charitable organizations like this in Shanghai, but so far, there is only this one society. The society has a remaining fund of 20 million, but they don't know how many services they need to do!</p>
<p>After the reporter visited the Shanghai Branch of the Red Cross, in addition to just increasing endless emotion, I only felt that Executive Tong Xingxingmen, who is 58 years old, is still running around day and night for those poor and sick people. How should the younger generation be alerted!</p>

<h3 id="e85">Land Registration in the City Limited to the End of This Month; Land Value Tax to be Levied from November <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Director of the Land Administration Bureau Zhu Ping and Director of the News Office Zhu Xubai hosted a reception for the city's news media at the New Life Recreation Club at 7:00 PM last night. More than a dozen reporters from various newspapers attended. During the reception, Director Zhu reported that land administration work is often regarded as a cold field by the general public, but in fact, land administration is the implementation of land policy and is closely related to local autonomy, so it is not a cold field. The land registration in the six districts of the city is limited to the end of October. Those who fail to register before the deadline or fail to explain the reasons will be considered ownerless land and will be taken over by the public. However, when paying taxes, they will still need to pay a fine. As for foreign land, it must be handled separately due to treaty relations. According to the order of the Executive Yuan, land value tax must be levied this year, and will begin in November. The tax rate will be 15 per mille according to the central government's regulations, and the total amount will be 3 billion. The price will be evaluated by the evaluation committee after declaration and investigation. The central government stipulates that representatives from nine institutions should form the committee: the Municipal Council (Speaker Pan Gongzhan), the Municipal Chamber of Commerce (Xu Jiquan), the Local Court (Cha Gengjian), the Federation of Trade Unions (Shui Xiangyun), the Education Association (Zhou Feicheng), the Bankers Association, the Farmers Association, the Finance Bureau, and the Public Works Bureau, plus the Land Administration Bureau, a total of ten units.</p>
<p>Director Zhu also explained the land registration procedures. Land registration takes a long time and the procedures are cumbersome, with a total of sixteen steps: 1. Check the map. 2. Sign the drawing. 3. Fill in the application form. 4. Collect registration fees. 5. Check the documents. 6. Collect the documents. 7. Issue a receipt. 8. Mark the points. 9. Review. 10. Complete the procedures. 11. Public announcement. 12. Formal registration. 13. Map. 14. Issue the ownership certificate. 15. Match the map. 16. Issue the registration certificate. According to the law, the public announcement must be made for two months. If there is no objection, formal registration can be made. If there is a dispute, there will be more trouble. Finally, Director Zhu explained the case of Zhou Songqian impersonating a representative of the Pudong Township.</p>
<p>During the meeting, Zheng Huang, the chief of the Deed Examination Section of the Land Administration Bureau, reported on the work of deed examination. Among them, Dao Deeds and imitation registration are the most troublesome. Dao Deeds are issued by the Daohe Yamen, but many of them involve property owned by Chinese people. Moreover, some of them were disposed of by the enemy, so there are many questions. Imitation registration was issued in 1855, which was a long time ago. It has been sold and resold, so the imitation registration is different from the grain string. It is also very cumbersome to check and verify the customs documents.</p>

<p>Hechang Shenzhuang, located at No. 13 Beilingli, Jinling Road, is owned by Huang Wusheng from Chaozhou. Its business is mainly to transport and sell various Chinese and foreign goods to the inland areas. Recently, Huang ordered a large number of domestic goods from Xinhua Cotton Mill and other domestic goods manufacturers, issuing bad checks totaling more than 80 million. When the manufacturers went to collect the money on the 26th of last month, they could not find it, so they negotiated with Huang. Unexpectedly, Huang Yusheng had already fled without a trace, and even his wives and concubines were gone. The factories reported to the Huangpu Police Station, which arrested Huang's partners Xu Shizhang and Guo Jinwang. After interrogation, they were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation yesterday morning.</p>

<p>Regarding the procedures for overseas Chinese returning to the country and the issue of repatriation, there has been no specific plan announced due to the pending decision of the government of the place of residence and the UNRRA. It is learned that regarding the entry procedures for overseas Chinese and technicians returning to Malaya, the following results have been reached after detailed discussions between our Consul General in Singapore and UNRRA representative Clark and the Director of the Singapore Immigration Department: (1) For overseas Chinese returning to Malaya, in addition to obtaining a lotus license, the visa procedures will be simplified. UNRRA will be entrusted by the Singapore Immigration Department to set up offices in Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, and Guangzhou to handle the procedures on their behalf. When arriving in Singapore by ship, the Immigration Department will verify the names. If it is confirmed that they lived in Singapore before and have not been deported, they can disembark. (3) The first batch of technicians will be sent back to the country first. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has sent the list of technicians, which has been forwarded to the Immigration Bureau and fully approved for entry. (3) After the technicians arrive in Singapore, the Nanyang Overseas Chinese General Association will bear the cost of returning to their original place of residence and will handle all the procedures on their behalf. As for whether the overseas Chinese registered in the Shanghai area will be repatriated by UNRRA to the above four ports for concentration or directly repatriated from Shanghai, the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Office has requested instructions from the central government.</p>

<p>At 5:40 PM yesterday, a truck with license number 42084 was speeding along Jiangpu Road and North Jin Road in Pudong, knocking down a child named Fang Afu who was playing by the roadside. His leg was broken, and his right eyeball fell out of its socket, with blood flowing all over the ground. The nearby police officers detained the drivers Chen Dawen and Li Kuicai for interrogation and sent the injured person to the Pudong Hospital for treatment. However, his injuries were too serious and his life is in danger.</p>

<p>The UNRRA Shanghai Branch recently received a batch of high-quality cod liver oil. The association decided to distribute it to those in the city who suffer from lung disease and poor nutrition. Poor lung disease patients in various hospitals and clinics, malnourished children in children's shelters and charitable organizations, and malnourished students in public and private primary schools and kindergartens can apply to the association. The application period is until the 10th of this month. Each person can only apply once. Distribution will be on the 16th of this month. Each person can receive 45 grams. Other lung disease patients and malnourished children who hold distribution permits within the scope of the cod liver oil and milk powder distribution station run by the association can request distribution with their certificates.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Zhongshan Hospital in Fenglin Bridge to Admit Patients from the 7th <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhongshan Hospital in Fenglin Bridge, the largest hospital in the city with a capacity of 400 beds, will begin admitting patients on the 7th of this month.</p>
<p>During the occupation, Zhongshan Hospital was converted into an army hospital by the Japanese. After the victory, it was successively stationed by the US military and our army. When the Medical Treatment Business Committee sent personnel to take over, not only was the equipment inside completely gone, but also the doors, windows, water, and electricity were all damaged. Only a dilapidated shell remained. Although it has been assisted by the donation of Kong Xiangxi, chairman of the Board of Directors of the Medical Treatment Business, and the Shanghai Medical College First Red Cross Hospital Aftermath Relief and Relief Administration, the financial resources are still insufficient to fully restore it. Only the ground floor and the second floor of the six-story palace-style building have been repaired. Therefore, after the resumption of business on the 7th of this month, it can only accommodate 120 to 130 patients. The outpatient clinic will not be able to start until the beginning of November. The hospital hopes that all sectors of society can continue to donate so that all 400 beds can be restored.</p>
<p>President Shen Kefei has served as Deputy Director of the Ministry of Health, President of Chongqing Central Hospital, and President of Nanjing Central Hospital. The hospital's doctors and nurses have established close contact with Shanghai Medical College and the First Hospital of the Red Cross and will be temporarily transferred.</p>

<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Nineteen Japanese soldiers were recently discovered hiding near the Jiangwan branch of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry’s experimental farm. They were in a disheveled state. Several of them were fluent in Chinese and begged for food in the vicinity disguised as beggars. Eventually, local residents noticed and reported them to the Prisoner of War Management Office of the Ministry of National Defense. On the morning of the 27th of last month at 11:00 a.m., personnel were dispatched along with military police to arrest them. After interrogation, it was found that some were war criminals.</p>
<p>In addition, there are currently more than 1,500 prisoners of war at the Jiangwan Prisoner of War Management Office of the Ministry of National Defense. To strengthen security, in addition to the original 23rd Regiment of military police, the 146th Brigade of the Army has been requested to send additional soldiers for guard duty.</p>

<p>The quantity of materials shipped by the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) to disaster areas in other provinces in September broke all previous records, reaching an all-time high. The amount of supplies shipped domestically by CRRRA in September was equal to the amount of goods received from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). In September, UNRRA shipped 131,310 tons of materials by sea. The total amount shipped by CRRRA to other ports and distributed in Shanghai was 121,772 tons. The difference between the two is negligible. Compared to the shipping volume in August, there was an increase of 27,500 tons.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the week from September 21st to 27th, the relief materials shipped by CRRRA to various disaster areas in other provinces amounted to 21,175.5 tons, and the amount distributed locally in Shanghai was 9,908.9 tons, totaling 31,084.4 tons. Foodstuffs still accounted for the majority of the materials shipped to other provinces, accounting for 85% of the total, or 19,051.6 tons.

<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Li Yuanyuan, a plasterer from Changshu, lost his wife early in life. After coming to this city, he began cohabitating with his fellow villager, Li Qiaozhen. They had a four-year-old son named Lingling. After the victory [over Japan], Li Yuanyuan became unemployed and lived on usurious loans, making life extremely difficult. Lingling contracted a lung disease, and Li could not afford treatment. On August 6th of this year, Li Yuanyuan and his concubine quarreled over the lack of rice to cook. Li Yuanyuan felt hopeless about the future and decided to take his own life. That night, he took Lingling and jumped into the Huangpu River to commit suicide. Fortunately, someone discovered them and rescued Li Yuanyuan, but Lingling had already drowned. The District Procuratorate filed a public prosecution, and the trial concluded yesterday with a verdict: Li Yuanyuan was found guilty of murder and sentenced to five years in prison.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Leases, Sales, and Transfers of Property Confiscated from Traitors After Victory Declared Invalid, 595 Buildings Confiscated from Traitors, Occupied by Various People, Some with Six or Seven Units Sharing One House <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Regarding the measures for handling properties confiscated from traitors, the reporter has learned that the principles have been decided, but they still need to be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The property rights and lease rights of all private houses belonging to traitors should be sealed, seized, managed, and used. After seizure, the Central Trust Bureau should be immediately notified to take over the custody. As for how to use them, it should be approved by the handling bureau and entrusted to the trust bureau for management. All sales, leases, or transfers of property confiscated from traitors after August 11, 1945, are invalid. As for those before August 11, 1945, the lease should be renewed with the Trust Bureau. Those who occupy without authorization will be ordered to move out and must pay back rent.</p>
<p>Regarding the properties confiscated from traitors, a total of 595 buildings have been found. There are 15 private houses of traitors that are currently occupied by the traitors themselves, including those who have rented or borrowed a portion of the property from the traitor's family without approval. A total of 298 buildings were rented out by traitors before the victory. This is based on what the current tenants and neighbors say, and many have not produced leases. A total of 57 buildings have been temporarily occupied with the approval of the Central Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Finance, the Municipal Government, the Third Front Army, the handling bureau, and the Military Intelligence Bureau. There are 87 buildings that have been forcibly occupied, including those occupied without approval or those with leases after the victory. As for the houses leased by traitors, 74 buildings are entirely occupied by the traitors themselves. 44 buildings are partially occupied by the traitors themselves. 15 buildings have been temporarily occupied with approval, and 5 buildings have been forcibly occupied.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Improving Port Affairs, Adding Ten Buoys, Repairing Damaged Docks, Preventing Theft, Another Subcommittee Meeting to Discuss <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Port Affairs Committee held its first meeting in the Municipal Government Conference Room at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. The attendees were: Mayor Wu Guozhen, Customs Director Zhang Fuyun, UNRRA Shanghai Branch Director Liu Hongsheng, Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhao Huijue, Public Works Bureau Director Zhao Zukang, Whangpoo Conservancy Bureau Director Ding Guitang, Deputy Director Shi Konghuai, Navigation Bureau Director Li Gufan, Ministry of Transportation Representative Song Xishang, Police Bureau Director Xuan Tiewu (represented by Fang Zhichao), Navy Headquarters Wei Jimin (represented by Tang Yonggen), Water Conservancy Committee Yang Naijun, Pilotage Committee Peng Chongwei, Resources Committee Zhu Tianbing, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Wei Huanzhang, Harbor Quarantine Office Dai Fangyuan, Committee Chief Secretary and Secretary Group Leader Xie Haoling, Naval Group Leader Yuan Jin, Inspection Group Leader Huang Younan, Investigation and Security Group Leader Zheng Zhongwei, and more than twenty others. Mayor Wu presided over the meeting, introduced the important officials of the committee, and then began discussing the issue of improving the berthing facilities for ships in the port. Marine Group Leader Yuan Jin stated:</p>
<p>(1) There are currently sixty major ship mooring buoys in the port, which is insufficient for actual needs. It is proposed to add ten Class A buoys in the second and third sections of the upstream area of the port to reduce berthing congestion. (2) There are approximately sixty-one docks in the port, of which seventeen have been damaged and are unusable. It is hoped that they can be repaired and restored to their original condition to increase berth space and alleviate warehouse congestion. (3) The docks in the Jinliyuan, Ning Shao, Dada, and Nanshi areas are mostly silted up and should be dredged as soon as possible to facilitate the berthing of inland river boats. (4) Many barges in the port are rented by UNRRA and it is hoped that they can be returned to the customs. Attendees fully expressed their opinions on the above issues. The chairman summarized the following: (1) Adding ten buoys is extremely necessary and the Marine Group should first inquire with the Materials Supply Bureau and UNRRA to see if there are any remaining materials that can be used, and then proceed with the approval process. (2) The repair of damaged docks is closely related to the Whangpoo Conservancy Bureau. It is proposed that the Marine Group investigate the detailed condition of each damaged dock, and the Whangpoo Conservancy Bureau should prepare a report on the water level measurements of each dock and submit it to the next meeting for discussion. The committee will notify the owners of the docks that are deemed urgently in need of repair, and set a deadline for completion. (3) The silted docks in the Nanshi area should be dredged as soon as possible to facilitate the berthing of Yangtze River inland vessels and avoid borrowing ocean-going wharf. This case is proposed to be studied by the Whangpoo Conservancy Bureau and then reviewed. (4) Regarding the return of barges by UNRRA, the damage to the barges during the eight years of the War of Resistance was extremely serious, and there is a real need to add more. Finally, the chairman reported that he would soon convene a subcommittee meeting of the Investigation and Security Group to study in detail the responsibilities and powers for cargo loading and unloading damage, as well as how to prevent theft, so as to submit it to the next general meeting for discussion. The meeting adjourned at approximately 11:00 a.m.</p>

In July of this year, a young widow from his hometown, Chen Xiaonian, came to Shanghai to seek refuge and was staying at her relative's house at 22 Jinxiu Lane, Changan Road, Nanshi. Chen Fahua, seeing that Chen was a single woman who could be taken advantage of, used coercive and deceptive means, under the pretext of registering her household, to trick Chen into the Maigen Hotel on Maigen Road, where he forced her into sexual relations. He then tricked her into his home, where he cohabited with her. Chen Xiaonian had some savings in her hometown and had purchased two gold rings weighing more than four qian in total. Chen valued them greatly and kept them tied to her waistband day and night, never taking them off. On the morning of September 2nd, she suddenly discovered that the gold rings on her waistband were missing. When she questioned Chen Fahua, she was beaten violently. At this point, Chen Xiaonian could no longer tolerate it and reported to the police station, who transferred the case to the court. During the court hearing yesterday, Chen Xiaonian testified that Chen Fahua had considerable influence and had committed murder, for which he was sentenced to ten years in prison. Fearing future retaliation, she did not intend to accuse him of the seduction.</p>

<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Zhang Ronggen, a 38-year-old from Ningbo, married Li Xingqing, 34. After their marriage, they lived in their hometown. The relationship between the couple was good. They had one son and one daughter. Years ago, during the War of Resistance, Li Chunshan (41 years old, from Kaifeng), a soldier of a certain puppet army unit stationed in Ningbo, was lustful and coveted Zhang's wife, Li's beauty, and harbored evil intentions. Later, he took two soldiers to Zhang's residence and forcibly abducted his wife, hiding her without a trace.</p>
<p>At the time, Zhang reported the information to Li's superior, a certain regimental commander, but he was accused of slander and imprisoned for four days. Later, Li asked someone to invite Zhang to write an unconditional note, giving her to Chunshan. Zhang had to succumb to the lewd power and humiliate himself. After the victory, he came to Shanghai to investigate, and because it was difficult to find a job, he worked as a shoe shiner. Recently, he found out that Li was an old quartermaster at the Yufeng Egg Shop at 150 Da Zhan Road. Yesterday at around 1:35 p.m., Li went shopping with a trainee from the factory, Li Rongxiang. When they passed Longmen Road and Racecourse Road, Zhang spotted them. He took out a bull knife he had hidden, followed them, knocked Li to the ground, grabbed Li's chest, and stabbed him three times, one each in the head, throat, and left waist. Li fell to the ground and died. The trainee, Li Rongxiang, shouted loudly, and officers from the 2240th patrol of the Zhongzheng Road Police Station of the new branch heard the sound and arrived to arrest Zhang and take him to the branch. Li's body was taken to Renji Hospital and transferred to the autopsy room for examination.</p>

<p>Most of the employees of the Yong'an Second Yarn Factory on Changping Road in Western Shanghai are from Guangdong. A few days ago, a yellowish-gray wild dog passed by, and the workers started to catch it. During the roundup, a male worker was bitten in the leg by the dog and sent to the hospital, fortunately without any life-threatening injuries. The next day, the dog was found again outside the factory gate and was knocked down by a factory employee surnamed Guo with a shoulder pole. The rabid dog spat out venom and died shortly after. When Mr. Guo struck the dog, he used too much force, causing the tiger's mouth of his right hand to break and bleed. When he retracted the shoulder pole, he accidentally wiped the venom on the other end of the shoulder pole onto the wound on his right hand. Unexpectedly, the toxicity of the rabid dog suddenly broke out while Guo was resting at home the next day. He lay on the ground, foaming at the mouth, rolling and shouting, making the barking sounds of a rabid dog. When his family saw this, they panicked and lost their senses. Before they could send him to the hospital for emergency treatment, he died.</p>

<p>(1) Persistent Cough</p>
<p>Jiang Hailing asks: My daughter is six years old and has been coughing for nearly fifty days. She was diagnosed by a doctor with whooping cough and injected with 3cc of whooping cough serum, and has also taken ordinary cough medicine, but all have been ineffective. I have several questions to ask for clarification: (1) Is it whooping cough that the child coughs lightly during the day and heavily at night, and vomits every time she coughs? (2) Is there a specific medicine for whooping cough in children? (3) Is the injection of whooping cough serum effective? (4) If left untreated, will it gradually heal?</p>
<p>[Answered by Dr. Yu Xinen, MD] Based on the described symptoms, it is whooping cough. Injecting serum as early as possible can reduce the symptoms, otherwise it is not easy to be effective. If you can take careful care, especially nutrition, it will heal by itself when the time comes.</p>
<p>(2) Headache in Pregnant Women</p>
<p>He Yun asks: Before my wife got married, she suffered from ear diseases, which occurred several times a year and were very painful when they occurred. After marriage, ear diseases occurred less frequently during pregnancy, but symptoms such as irritability and headache occurred successively. This is of course a disease that pregnant women should have. However, the headache is the most severe, often leading to neglect of eating and sleeping, and any operation cannot be supported. My wife has one son and one daughter. Every time she becomes pregnant, her health gradually deteriorates. This year she became pregnant again, and the headache is still the same as before. I don’t know what kind of disease it is? Is it related to ear disease? Or is it malnutrition? What medicine should I take?</p>
<p>[Answered by Dr. Yu Xinen, MD] Headaches and other diseases during pregnancy are symptoms of pregnancy toxemia. It is necessary to check blood pressure, fundus, urine, etc., and then diagnose and treat according to the situation after finding out the cause.</p>
<p>(3) Numbness in Right Wrist</p>
<p>Yan Qiujuan asks: When I was 19 years old, I noticed that my right wrist and five fingers were numb. It doesn't hurt or itch, but I have no strength to pick things up (such as chopsticks, sewing needles, and other common household chores). At first, due to economic reasons, I did not seek medical treatment. It has been ten years now. The symptoms are still the same, but the lower arm is slightly thinner than the left arm, and the skin on the fingers and palms is the same as on the right, only slightly thinner and tender. Please ask: (1) What is this disease? (2) Can it be cured? (3) Are there any internal medicines that I can buy and take myself?</p>
<p>[Answered by Dr. Yu Xinen, MD] What you are suffering from seems to be infantile paralysis. In the beginning, it can be treated with electrotherapy to prevent muscle decay, but it has been ten years and it is difficult to recover.</p>

<h3 id="e111">City Chamber of Commerce Cables Ministry of Finance to Appeal for Salaried Workers: Income Tax Burden Too Heavy, Indirectly Encouraging Labor Unrest and Increasing the Sources of Chaos <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The City Chamber of Commerce believes that the new income tax law has increased too sharply and that the general salaried class cannot afford it, so it telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, saying: "Received a letter from the Shanghai Banking and Commerce Association, which said: 'Previously received a letter from the Chongqing Banking Association, which stated briefly that the newly promulgated revised income tax law stipulates that income from salaries and remuneration will be taxed from 50,000 yuan and above. The method of calculation is based on the actual income amount as the income amount. We believe that paying taxes is an obligation that the people should fulfill, but the tax exemption amount is too low. At a time when prices are soaring, the actual income of salaried personnel, when converted according to the price index, is very meager. It is not enough to maintain the minimum standard of living, let alone bear such a heavy tax burden. This matter concerns all sectors of the country. How should it be handled? We hope that your association will discuss it and reply.' Approved. It is true that the revised income tax rate for salaries and wages starts at 50,000 yuan, and the tax-free amount is indeed too low. At the same time, every employee whose income exceeds 240,000 yuan must pay 100 yuan in tax for every 1,000 yuan. There are many salaried personnel with a monthly income of 300,000 yuan, and the amount of income tax they have to pay is more than 13,990 yuan. This is equivalent to deducting nearly 5% from their already insufficient living expenses, which is no different from taking away two dou of rice from those who rely on their salaries for a living. Therefore, how to make the collection amount reasonable in the face of fluctuating currency values and rising prices is a matter that must be considered comprehensively. Otherwise, income tax, which is one of the best taxes, has provisions that are not comprehensive and detailed, but the signing of the tax rate is difficult to meet the actual situation. Implementation will harm people's livelihood, and cessation will damage national revenue. I think all industries have this confusion. Your association leads all industries and should consider this collective case as soon as possible. Therefore, I am sending this special letter to you, hoping that you will consider it and reply so that we can forward it.' Arrived at the meeting. It has been found that the currency value has changed too quickly and too much in recent years, and it is difficult to adapt to the changing state of each month if a fixed tax rate is proposed for salary and remuneration income. Currently, a salary of 300,000 yuan in Shanghai is difficult to maintain the household expenses of a family of several people. According to the current tax rate for deducting salary income, it is necessary to pay as much as 13,990 yuan in tax. On the employee's side, it is inevitable that they will be even more strained. Therefore, employees in various industries have already appealed for tax exemption. If the adjustment is not considered, the employees will be oppressed by heavy taxes and will have to increase their wages constantly as a remedy. This will only encourage labor unrest and increase the sources of social chaos. It has been found that the recent price ratio, taking food rice, which is important and has a relatively late price increase, as an example, is about 6,000 times that of the pre-war period. Therefore, the current salary of 300,000 yuan per month for industrial and commercial employees is approximately equal to 50 yuan before the war. Before the war, the income tax for the second category of salaries was tax-free for those under 30 yuan. From 30 yuan to 60 yuan, 5 cents of tax was levied for every 10 yuan. A salary of 50 yuan only bears an income tax of 1 dime and 5 cents. The current adjustment plan is to follow this precedent as much as possible, with the base salary of less than 30 yuan multiplied by the monthly cost of living index as the income tax exemption point. For salaries exceeding the tax exemption point, 5 cents of tax will be levied for every 10 yuan if the living index multiplied by the salary does not exceed the pre-war ratio of 60 yuan. The standard will be more reasonable, and the burden may be勉力. I hope that your ministry will consider and adopt it for implementation, which will be for the public good."</p>
<h3 id="e112">Multi-Headed Competition to Close Out Positions, Gold and Banknotes All Fall <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the interbank market was tight, with supply exceeding demand, and it fell slightly. The morning opening was around 2,175,000, and the high price did not exceed 2,178,000. After that, it lacked support and gradually softened. After 10:00 am, the central bank allocated 80 bars, and the price was reduced to 2,162,500. Afterwards, there was still no improvement, and the supply did not stop. Long positions were forced to close out, and the noon was the most unsustainable, falling to a low price of 2,140,000. In the afternoon, there were even more people who lowered prices to seek cash, and some even fell to 2,135,000 for immediate delivery. Next-day delivery still rose slightly, rising to over 2,150,000. As a result, it closed down 23,000 from the previous day. Ornamental gold fell to 228,000. Refined silver and silver dollars were stable. The dark rate of interbank lending was still tight, ranging from 13 to 16 cents. In the afternoon, it rose to 18 cents.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies also changed little. Under the supply of foreign bank recycling goods, coupled with speculation that the circulation of US dollars was prohibited, new purchases were restrained. From the high price of 4,000 yuan in the early morning, it gradually fell. Although there were minor setbacks in the middle, it did not help. At noon, it finally broke through the 3,900 yuan mark. In the afternoon, immediate delivery fell slightly again. Later, the gold price opened for next-day delivery and rose slightly together. Finally, it struggled around 3,900 yuan. As a result, it closed down 80 yuan from the previous day. The price difference with gold widened slightly to 550 yuan per ten taels. Hong Kong banknotes were stable, with a small increase of 5 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was still above 820 yuan due to the telegram from Hong Kong. The Indian exchange rate was selling for 1,000 yuan. The British exchange rate rose to 13,400 yuan. The US exchange rate was still not being traded.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Bond Market Weak <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Since the bulls in the bond market had made some gains, buying sentiment turned quiet. In addition, the financial sector provided some supply, so it fell. Tongbing opened slightly lower at 2,070 yuan in the morning. This price continued to be surrounded by sellers and fell continuously. At noon, it was unable to recover and fell into the 1,900 yuan range. As a result, it closed down 180 yuan from the previous day. Jiayi, Yiyi and Wuwu each fell by 100 yuan. Tongding also fell by 70 yuan. The transaction volume was approximately 5 million yuan in par value.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Foreign Stocks Also Correct Slightly <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Foreign stocks were corrected slightly as securities firms closed positions. Yisha opened at 10,200 yuan and fell to 9,600 yuan. The rest were also dragged down. Yinglian was more stable and fell very little. As a result, Yinglian, Ye Guangwei, Hede Fengzhi, Yipi, Airlines and Steel fell by a little more than half a percent. Yisha fell by slightly less than 10%.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Foreign Tea Firms Active, Baochang Reopens <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The foreign tea market is gradually strengthening. Overseas demand is still good, and the market is very strong. Some varieties have even made further progress. It is also known that the British firm Baochang, which has reorganized its forces, heard that the foreign manager and tea master had flown from England to Shanghai at 4:00 pm the day before yesterday, and may join the activities next week. As for the domestic sales of red and green tea, the shops and banks in this street and the Su-Xi area are still following one after another. At the same time, the Tianjin Gang, which had been stagnant for a long time, has also been revived, but the actual demand is very narrow, and the buying sentiment is fleeting.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Sugar Price Remains Unchanged <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Sugar Price Review Committee of the Social Affairs Bureau held the 16th Sugar Price Review Committee yesterday. It is reported that the review result is that the 16th sugar price will remain the same as the 15th period price. The calculated price is 130,000 yuan per dan for granulated sugar and 110,000 yuan per dan for raw sugar.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Impact of US Seamen's Strike, Foreign Exchange Approval for Orders to be Postponed, Exchange Settlement Period for Machinery Imports Also Adjusted <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The recent strike by US seamen has made it impossible for Shanghai importers to receive US goods on schedule. The foreign exchange letters of credit for which they have applied for approval must be extended. The Foreign Exchange Review Office of the Central Bank has agreed to the extension. The bank issued Special Circular No. 53 to designated banks yesterday, stating: "The recent strike by US seamen will inevitably delay freight. The letters of credit and entrustment purchase certificates opened by various designated banks for merchants to order goods from the United States before September 5, 1946, have not yet expired, or those opened after this date, the banks, after verifying the facts, may extend them themselves without applying for approval from this bank. The extension period shall be from the expiration date of the letter of credit and entrustment purchase certificate to the date of resumption of work by the seamen, plus one month. However, letters of credit and entrustment purchase certificates that expired before September 5, 1946, shall not be extended without the approval of this bank."</p>
<p>Currently, the Central Bank originally stipulated that the foreign exchange for which exchange settlement has been approved must be used to ship the goods purchased from abroad to Shanghai within three months. If the deadline is exceeded, it will become invalid. However, the shipping schedule for foreign machinery and production tools often exceeds three months, and some are even delayed for up to one year. This regulation is tantamount to prohibiting the import of foreign machinery, and the domestic machinery production industry has been severely damaged. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, in view of this, has agreed with the Central Bank to remedy the situation. The effective period of exchange settlement for the purchase of machinery imports from the Central Bank will be adjusted so that the import of production tools will not be restricted by time and suffer losses. This measure will greatly benefit the reconstruction of China's machinery industry.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Rayon Skyrockets and Plummets, Yesterday Up 400,000 Again, Japanese Goods Arrive, CITIC to Distribute Soon <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Rayon rebounded yesterday, with the first call at 120 Tianqiao Youguang at a minimum of 4.1 million yuan. Later, due to lack of supply, there was a market but no goods, and the price was raised again to 800,000 yuan. The maximum called was over 900,000 yuan. It was slightly smaller in the afternoon, trading at 700,000 yuan, 400,000 yuan higher than the previous day. The most stagnant Yi cargo 120 Guang in the market was traded at 3.9 million yuan yesterday.</p>
<p>CITIC Distribution Limited to Manufacturers</p>
<p>The rayon ordered by the Central Trust Bureau from Japan has indeed arrived here. The bureau sent personnel to pick up the goods yesterday (2nd) and will begin distribution soon. The distribution method is being drafted. According to Wang Zijian, director of the Committee for the Sale of Government Materials and Property, who is acting as an agent for the bureau, the distribution of this batch of rayon to Shanghai still needs to be discussed with the Textile Construction Company. The principle is to directly supply the manufacturers to avoid it falling into the hands of merchants and becoming a tool for speculation and hoarding. According to the barter agreement, MacArthur's headquarters will still supply rayon on a monthly basis next year, which can be continuously transported. There will be no problem with the supply of rayon to the market.</p>
<p>Association Investigation Actual Conditions of Each Factory</p>
<p>After the Japanese rayon arrived, the Central Trust Bureau yesterday summoned the persons in charge of the Electrical Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association to inquire about the actual conditions of each factory as a basis for allocation. Therefore, the directors and supervisors of the industry have decided to go to each factory today to conduct on-site investigations, record the current production situation and the actual quantity of rayon required in a systematic manner, and report it to the Central Trust Bureau. It is reported that the distribution will be accurately allocated according to the actual needs to eliminate the black market.</p>
<p>Textile Construction Company Sells Surplus Enemy Property</p>
<p>In order to suppress the rise in rayon prices, the Textile Manufacturing Company negotiated with the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui to allocate a portion of the enemy property rayon and decided to sell it to the market publicly today (3rd). Each silk factory that has completed the registration procedures can be allocated about one box per unit, and the sale will continue thereafter.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Rise Reaches Saturation Point, Yarn and Cloth Enter Stagnant State, High Prices Difficult to Sell, Interbank Market Too Tight, North Road Merchants Turn to Changshu and Wuxi for Procurement <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Yarn Factory Joint Distribution Committee held its regular meeting yesterday. As a result of the discussion, the standard amount of 20-count cotton yarn to be sold was 1869.5 pieces for private factories and 1178.5 pieces for Textile Construction. The selling price is still 1.55 million yuan per piece, based on 400 pounds of 20-count yarn as the standard.</p>
<p>The yarn market fell sharply yesterday. The reason is that the merchants' stomachs have reached saturation and they have not added any more. In addition, colleagues are forced to seek cash due to the interbank market, and they have sold their goods one after another. After the initial transaction of five pieces of Double Horse at 2.26 million in the morning, sellers came one after another, and it fell sharply. The final closing price was 2.15 million. The other 20-count and 16-count also fell by 100,000 to 160,000. The decline of 42-count was even more severe, about 300,000 less than the previous day.</p>
<p>The reason is that the price is too high, and sales have stopped. The price is also too high for over-the-counter sales in this street, and procurement is very rare. Under this state, all colleagues are in a tight interbank market and are eager to sell their goods. Subsequently, the Guangdong Gang absorbed a small amount at a low price, and the market for fine-count yarn and thread rebounded slightly.</p>
<p>The cloth market also gradually became stagnant yesterday. Four Gentlemen poplin was 96,000 yuan. Jumping Carp poplin was 2,000 yuan higher than the price quoted by Textile Construction, at 90,000 yuan. Caiqiu fine cloth was 86,000 to 7,000 yuan, which has also declined. Since the adjustment of the exchange rate, the price of cloth has been rising. Although the Textile Construction authorities have tried their best to suppress it at the original price, it is still useless. The continuous surge in prices in recent weeks is due to the imbalance between supply and demand. Now that the rising momentum has reached the saturation point, its reaction is also a natural reason. In addition, the interbank market is very tight, and some merchants from North Road are stationed in Changshu, Wuxi and other production areas to procure, so the dark interest rate in these two places is as high as 27%. Moreover, the Central Trust Bureau is also tendering for a large number of yarn and cloth, which makes people even more nervous. However, according to well-informed sources, the base price of the Central Trust Bureau's tender is very high. For example, the base price of Four Gentlemen old goods poplin is 92,500 yuan. The market price yesterday was about 97,000 yuan. Therefore, the tender price of the undertaker must be higher than its base price. Therefore, although the market is weak, it does not seem to be in danger of collapsing.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Wenteng, Director of the Business Department of the Textile Industry Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, recently returned to Shanghai after being promoted to Beijing on official business. He told reporters that he had contacted the Executive Yuan regarding the method of transporting yarn and cloth to the south and requested that a supplementary instruction be given to the Customs Administration so that the method could be implemented on the day the Executive Yuan's order arrived. In addition, although he had requested instructions on the method of expanding the yarn and cloth distribution organization, he had not yet obtained any specific clues.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Tight Interbank Market, Chinese Stocks Fall, Only Central Silk Announces Increase <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Chinese stocks began to fall yesterday. The interbank market was tight, and the fire was unfavorable. It was difficult to advance further. People in the securities industry and miscellaneous capital all cut their positions and sold them. Although the wealthy households entered, they were not many. The banks also provided a small amount of supply, so the overall situation was repeatedly timid and unable to recover. When the market opened in the morning, all stocks except Jingfu (hot stocks opened with Jingfu first) had already fallen slightly. Even if there was a rebound after the opening, they all failed to exceed the previous closing price. The feet were therefore weak. Subsequently, under the more common cutting of long positions, they gradually fell. However, there were frequent struggles in the middle. Ultimately, the interbank market became tighter, and many parties in the material sector closed their positions. Banks also sold slightly, and the shorts began to take action. After the low point near noon, there was a rebound after covering short positions, but because of the suppression of physical goods, it was not firm at the close. Only Central Silk, with limited chips, stood tall. As a result, Yongsasha, Meiya and Jingfu each fell by less than half a percent from the previous close, Qinxing fell by slightly more than half a percent, and Xinguang fell by only 10 yuan. Central Textile, Datong, Cement each fell by slightly less than 10% among the cold stocks. Xinyi, Tongyi, Rongfeng, Huafeng Matches, Xinya, Wuhe, Jinglun Underwear each fell by about half a percent. The rest fell slightly. The total turnover was 12.57 million shares. Most of the over-the-counter stocks also fell.</p>

<p>The rice market registered more than 15,000 stones of cargo yesterday. The Social Affairs Bureau also sold 200 bags of Taiwanese rice, but because the stores were still wealthy and the production areas were firm and expensive, the price of indica rice continued to rise by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Newly harvested glutinous rice had few arrivals and sales, and the market was stable. A small amount of newly harvested early rice (the so-called kiln seed Bagger rice) has arrived in Shanghai, but there is no surge. Baiyuanjiu was tired for a long time. Today, because of the movement of zero sales, it rebounded by 1,000 yuan. The interior reported an increase in wheat prices. Arrivals and inventory were scarce. Ningbo Gang entered the market, and there were also inquiries from other parties. The price rose by 1,000 yuan, and the situation was stable. The source of soybeans in the northeast is still available, and high-quality goods are firm. Zhongguan rebounded by 1,000 yuan. Secondary goods were stable and tired. Sesame and Suzhou were unable to digest foreign goods, and local zero sales were also weak. High-quality goods were barely stable, and medium and low goods rebounded slightly by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The Nanyang sales of raw peanuts were sluggish, and the old goods fell by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Xinshengren fell sharply by nearly 10,000 yuan. The price of vegetables and soybeans fell by 3,000 yuan. Broad beans have been rising sharply for days. Today, because the sales have turned weak, the rise has stopped and turned into a fall, decreasing by 1,000 yuan, forming a pattern of large rises and small corrections. Bran continues to be popular in rural areas, rising by another 100 to 200 yuan. Raw oil was firm in the morning and weak in the afternoon, and the price rose by more than 2,000 yuan. Soybean oil has a firm trend due to high prices in the interior. Rapeseed oil has no change. Soybean cake in Shantou and Taiwan is slightly traded, but there are not many stocks and the price has risen by 200 to 300 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Handkerchief Industry Agrees on New Prices <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The selling price of handkerchiefs in this city has always been very stable. Recently, due to the soaring price of cotton yarn, various factories have sought to adjust. The industry association convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors on September 30 to discuss the selling price. It is reported that as a result of the discussion, it was decided to sell based on the actual cost plus legal profit. The new selling price of 60-count woven 18-inch is 20,000 yuan per dozen, satin 24,000 yuan, 40-count woven 18-inch is 14,000 yuan, satin 16,000 yuan, 100-count 60-count interwoven 18-inch 35,000 yuan, 100-count 18-inch 44,000 yuan, 12-inch is calculated as half of 18-inch. Members have been notified to strictly comply and not to raise prices privately.</p>

<p>The Central Trust Bureau was ordered to purchase raw silk. So far, only two batches have been received, totaling more than 2,600 dans. The third batch is being reviewed by the China Silkworm Company. In the midst of rising silk prices, some manufacturers are waiting and hoping that the Central Trust Bureau will raise the purchase price. According to the person in charge of the Central Trust Bureau, the recent increase in silk prices was driven by rayon and is only a temporary phenomenon. It will return to its original state in the short term. The purchase price this time was carefully considered by the government, and merchants will definitely not suffer losses. Moreover, the silk price above grade D will be determined by the Purchase and Sales Committee again, and there is room for flexibility. I hope that all manufacturers will appreciate the government's hard work and not be extravagant. The government-set price is already a big loss compared to foreign market prices. It is impossible to ask for a further increase. Therefore, the purchase method will not be changed. In addition, the Central Bank has notified the Central Trust Bureau, the China Silkworm Company, and the Commodity Testing Bureau to designate representatives for the Raw Silk Purchase and Sales Committee so that it can be established.</p>

<p>Regarding the fact that MacArthur's headquarters advisor, Mr. Magana, announced the rejection of the transportation of Japanese cocoons to China, it has attracted the attention of the whole country. In addition to wiring Situ Huoshi to preside over justice, the Shanghai Three-District Silk Reeling Industry Association wired the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate strictly. The association will also convene a meeting of all directors and supervisors today to determine the negotiation policy, and then regularly invite Chinese and foreign reporters from the city to report the eight years of the Japanese looting of our silk industry.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Intense Competition, Shortage of Funds, Department Store Industry Not Easy to Develop <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Recently, a person in the department store industry told reporters that the industry's main business is retail and the sale of cotton, silk, woolen fabrics, cosmetics, enamel, rubber, etc. There are about 900 colleagues in the industry. Therefore, business competition is quite fierce. Currently, the only things that the industry can rely on to make profits are fancy goods and various rare luxury goods. Ordinary general-purpose goods, such as cotton fabrics, have recently seen a gradual increase in factory prices. However, due to competition, the retail price in stores has never been able to increase. It is reported that the recent retail sales in the industry have not improved due to the general reduction in the purchasing power of citizens. On average, only 20% of gross profit can be earned per month. The working capital is short. For example, winter goods must be fully prepared in the autumn, so they have to borrow funds from various banks. The interest owed this month alone is as high as 15%, so they really cannot bear the pressure of high-interest loans. In addition, heavy donations and taxes and the proliferation of private goods are also obstacles to the future development of the industry.</p>

If the company is approved, the relief agency will only be its employer. As for the relief agency allocating US$2 million to cooperate with it, the allocation will be made after Mr. Chennault signs a contract with the agency. However, this sum must be returned when the agency is dissolved. It is said that Mr. Chennault is flying to Beijing again to exert every effort to achieve success.</p>

<p>Timber: The market is brisk. Fir timber is still favored by buyers, and there are people searching for it. The market atmosphere for foreign pine is also good.</p>
<p>Tin Foil: The market is declining. Although existing inventory has a one-month deadline to be sold, with a tax to be paid if it is overdue, it remains to be seen whether convenient (tax-free) export will be possible within this deadline. If taxes are required, the prospects will remain weak.</p>
<p>Hardware: Prices are gradually stabilizing, and the absorption capacity of out-of-town merchants is also weakening. Local sales in this city are still good.</p>
<p>Woolen Fabrics: Autumn sales are underway. Transactions of woolen fabrics, whether in large or small quantities, retail or wholesale, are all flourishing. Out-of-town merchants also continue to increase their purchases, especially those from Nanjing, who are most diligent in purchasing. However, they are all limited to fine wool goods and overcoat fabrics.</p>
<p>Sichuan Pickled Mustard Tuber: Although the peak season for sales has passed, the amount in stock is not much, especially for high-quality goods. Top-grade [Sichuan pickled mustard tuber] from well known producers must be sold for 140,000 to 150,000 yuan, while inferior ones are less than 100,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Academic Credentials of Middle School Students from the Nine Northeastern Provinces: Ministry of Education to Adjust According to the Current Academic System <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The middle schools in the Nine Northeastern Provinces during the puppet Manchukuo period followed a four-year academic system. The academic credentials of middle school students who graduated after four years are not in accordance with the current system. The Ministry of Education has recently adjusted these academic credentials. For this year's graduates who have completed four years of study, the standard will be equivalent to the qualifications for the first year of senior high school. If they continue their studies, they can enter the second year of senior high school. Those who have completed three years of study are equivalent to junior high school graduates. The rest can be inferred by analogy. Now that the Nine Northeastern Provinces have been changed to a six-year secondary school system in accordance with the Ministry's order, all institutions will follow this method to verify the academic qualifications of students from middle schools established during the puppet Manchukuo regime.</p>

The measures set by the provincial government are divided into two categories: (A) measures to increase the salaries of middle school teachers, and (B) measures to advance salary payments. The most important aspects are that starting from August, salaries will be paid according to the standards of the [Northeast Administrative] Headquarters, and salaries will be paid monthly and on time thereafter. Starting from September, principals will be paid an advance of 15,000 yuan per month, and teachers will be paid 14,000 yuan per month.</p>

<p>[Our News] The National Third Overseas Chinese Middle School was established after the outbreak of the Pacific War to accommodate the children of overseas Chinese who returned to China.

Since its establishment, more than twenty classes have graduated from junior and senior high school, with a large number of students spread across the provinces of the country. It is recently heard that alumni in Shanghai plan to organize an alumni branch in Shanghai, initiated by He Yingjiang, Ren Zongxiu, Tan Yuefu, Li Yinghong, He Shishan, and others, and are currently making preparations.</p>

<p>Aurora University has 3,000 mu of school land in Songjiang and Qingpu counties, which was donated by Mr. Ma Xiangbo to the Catholic Church 47 years ago as an educational fund. At that time, Aurora University had not yet been established. Aurora University has accepted it from the Catholic Church for more than 40 years without incident. However, after Mr. Ma passed away, Ma Qiu Renwo, who claimed to be Ma's daughter-in-law, and her daughter Yu Zhang, relying on special forces, seized more than 7,000 shi of rent rice over the years. After the victory, they again reported to the county government, falsely accusing Lu Shixi, the rent collector of Aurora University, of being a traitor and detaining him in the Suzhou High Court detention center for three months. Taking advantage of these three months, they seized another thousand shi of rent rice in the countryside. By the time the court found Lu not guilty and released him, all the rent rice had been seized. Subsequently, Aurora University filed a lawsuit in accordance with the law and presented all the evidence. On September 23, the Songjiang Court declared a verdict confirming the ownership of Aurora University, and Ma Qiu Renwo lost the lawsuit. All losses incurred by Aurora, involving civil and criminal matters, will be pursued separately in accordance with the law.</p>

<p>The Municipal Government approved the telegram from the Ministry of Interior, which submitted instructions from the Executive Yuan, explaining two items of electoral doubts regarding municipal assembly members as follows: "(1) As farmers' associations, labor unions, fishermen's associations, education associations, and free professional organizations all have employees as members, when electing municipal assembly members, the number of seats allocated should be calculated based on the number of members actually participating in the selection of professional organizations. As for members of chambers of commerce, as the Chamber of Commerce Law clearly defines them as companies and firms, the number of seats should be calculated based on the number of companies and firms. Whether this calculation standard is fair is a legislative issue and cannot be changed by interpretation. (2) If the regulations for the election of county and municipal assembly members are completely the same, then their interpretations can be mutually applied."

<h3 id="e157">The Layers Beneath Hong Kong's Prosperity <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Ling Fang, Hong Kong Airmail Dispatch, 30th of this Month</p>
<p>"…On the surface, Hong Kong has recovered quickly, but Hong Kong's trade is mutually dependent on Chinese commerce; Hong Kong itself only accounts for one aspect. Hong Kong's complete restoration to its pre-war status as a major world trading port still awaits the improvement of the situation in China." —"Standard Chartered Bank Annual Report."</p>
<p>Another year has passed since the British troops re-entered Hong Kong.</p>
<p>In the past year, Hong Kong has transitioned from military administration to civil administration, from the recovery phase to the construction phase. Although there are still some areas that are "not as ideal," order has replaced chaos, society has stabilized, and all industries are gradually recovering, strengthening people's confidence in the future. This was something no one could have predicted a year ago. Recently, many people from mainland China have traveled all the way to Hong Kong for sightseeing. From as far as Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan (including a Wuhan reporter group) to as near as Guangdong and Guangxi (including a Guangzhou reporter group), they have set foot on the island, heard and seen things firsthand, with more praise than criticism. The British are indeed seasoned veterans in ruling colonies. It is just a pity that after two world wars, the blood and sweat of millions of people cannot wash away their outdated thinking. Hong Kong, this little bird, remains a milestone marking the stain on Sino-British relations over the past century, rather than serving as the cornerstone for mutual understanding and sincere co-existence between the two great nations. This is something we lament.</p>
<p>Measures of the Military Government</p>
<p>In the past twelve months, Hong Kong experienced eight months of military administration. The British took advantage of this transitional period to clear away the remnants left by the Japanese. During the military administration, "all powers and responsibilities, including judicial, legislative, and administrative powers, and jurisdiction over the property of all people in Hong Kong, were the responsibility of Major General Ha Han, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army, Navy, and Air Force in Hong Kong." This placed Hong Kong's complex political affairs under the direct control of the military government. The military government brought in a large number of experts, some of whom had been planning the future return to Hong Kong since the fall of Hong Kong. Based on the plan approved by the British Colonial Office, they engaged in reconstruction work, utilizing the supreme power of the military government.</p>
<p>When the Union Jack was hoisted over Hong Kong Island again, the military government issued a decree controlling food and fuel. Following this, a large number of relief ships brought in grain, resolving the food problem. Not only was it resolved, but the "one yuan for five catties" of white rice also attracted countless people from mainland China to Hong Kong, supporting the market and serving as a powerful factor for future prosperity. The supply of water and electricity was also restored in the shortest possible time. During this period, the military government strived to preserve the vitality of the local community. Although possessing unlimited power, it never took excessive actions that would provoke popular resentment. For example, prostitution was banned before the war, but during the military administration, public brothels were established. Before the war, small food vendors had to obtain business licenses, but during the military administration, people were free to set up stalls. Before the war, bicycles and pedicabs were not allowed to carry passengers, but during the military administration, bicycles and pedicabs often served as public buses, carrying passengers back and forth (these phenomena were gradually prohibited after the restoration of civil administration). The military government's measures were mostly focused on basic tasks: (1) conducting birth and death registrations (to count the population); (2) establishing tenancy tribunals (to settle residents); (3) cracking down on exchange shops and silver houses that were not registered before the war (to stabilize finance); (4) requiring schools, organizations, and newspapers to register their radio receivers; (5) enforcing immigration restrictions on those who were not of Chinese nationality (to maintain public order); (6) restoring transportation (to facilitate people's livelihood), … Among these, the restoration of transportation was the most effective.</p>
<p>On the eve of the Japanese surrender, Hong Kong's harbor and its surroundings were filled with mines, and there were many floating mines in the Pearl River estuary. In fact, surface traffic between Hong Kong and Guangzhou and Macau had ceased. At that time, only a few motorized junks risked sailing, and travelers regarded it as a dangerous journey. After the tragedy of the Haizhu Steamer sinking outside Humen after striking a mine, drowning more than a dozen people, people turned pale at the mention of floating mines at sea. On the land, the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway was fully repaired and open to traffic by mid-November, while the British naval mine-sweeping team had not yet completed its work. At the beginning of this year, the British Navy also cleared the mines in the Pearl River Estuary for us, and Hong Kong's traffic to the inland rivers of Guangdong Province was able to proceed unimpeded.</p>
<p>Regarding traffic between Hong Kong and Kowloon, the military government took over the ferry company and the bus company, using the remaining ships and vehicles to maintain transportation in various places, which was quite effective. With the exception of doubling the bus fares, the ferry fares were still charged at pre-war rates. These two measures, along with food control, can be considered the most effective measures taken by the British.</p>
<p>On May 1st, Hong Kong officially restored civil administration. If the military government's measures sought stability amidst chaos, then the civil administration's measures sought progress from stability. Therefore, the "tolerance" of the military administration no longer existed at this time. After Governor Yang Muqi was sworn in, he appointed members of the Executive Council and the Legislative Council, restoring the Executive Council and Legislative Council. The foundation of "the rule of law" was re-established. Experts sent by London, including political and technical experts, arrived in Hong Kong in succession. Almost every one of them represented every pre-war problem in Hong Kong. They organized all kinds of committees, such as the Reconstruction Planning Committee, the Housing Construction Committee, the Port Expansion Committee, the Committee for Studying Tenancy Legislation, the Labor Arbitration Committee, and even the Car Left-Hand Drive Research Committee.… They all meticulously reviewed problems, specifically proposed solutions, and acted once decisions were made, never engaging in empty talk on paper, deceiving themselves and others, or perfunctorily fulfilling their responsibilities. This was completely different from the style of bureaucratic politics. Because the rule of law was restored, laws passed before the war have been successively restored to enforcement. In order to adjust industrial and commercial supply and promote economic prosperity, the Hong Kong government issued the "1946 Price Control Ordinance" following the Grain Control Ordinance, and soon also issued laws such as regulations on the use of materials (including buildings, airplanes, and vehicles), import licenses, and the control of textiles? … (see the article "Hong Kong Industrial Leaps" on August 9th), planning to control the entire market and forcing merchants to turn from the road of speculation back to normal business. "Trade figures have increased substantially, symbolizing a bright future for Hong Kong, and residents can fully rely on stable and valuable currency." – Report by Morse, General Manager of HSBC, July 12th.</p>
<p>The stability of Hong Kong's currency is indeed one of the main conditions for promoting Hong Kong's prosperity. The Hong Kong government set an exchange rate (one Hong Kong dollar is worth one shilling, two pence, and one-quarter of a British pound), making Hong Kong dollars directly linked to British pounds, not only avoiding the impact of fluctuations in Chinese legal tender, but also absorbing large amounts of funds from wealthy Chinese people as new blood for the construction of Hong Kong. The emerging capital of China after the war, just like the wealth of warlords and landlords in the past, built Western-style houses or large factories in the valleys or seashores of Hong Kong and Kowloon.</p>
<p>In past dispatches, the reporter has pointed out the benefits of low wages in Hong Kong to Hong Kong's industrial recovery. The Hong Kong government spared no effort to prevent price increases from stimulating wage increases, and consulted with the management to set a fixed wage, which major factories uniformly complied with. Since the restoration of civil administration, labor strikes in Hong Kong have occurred repeatedly, especially the two strikes at the Hong Kong Electric Company and the cross-harbor ferry company, which were the most serious. However, the workers were also unable to fully achieve their demands. Therefore, Hong Kong's factories have resumed work one after another, and there is talk of Shanghai factories relocating to Hong Kong (117 Shanghai foreign-owned factories have registered in Hong Kong after the war). Speaking of this, let us look back at the work of our country's agencies stationed in Hong Kong in the past year. Let us start with the reception aspect: we must not forget that Major General Ha Han led the British fleet back into Hong Kong to accept the surrender of the local Japanese army on the orders of the Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese War Zone, and our military delegation also entered Hong Kong with the British fleet. What we received, in addition to the remaining weapons of the Japanese army and dozens of broken ships in Hong Kong, was nothing else. It cannot be compared with the "reception" in Beijing and Shanghai, but the things left by the Japanese were not few. Not to mention anything else, the Osaka Pier on the Central Waterfront has now become the "Standard Chartered Pier." The head of the military delegation stationed in Hong Kong has been changed three times, and the difficulty of the reception work can be imagined.</p>
<p>In the early days of the British army's re-entry into Hong Kong, its strength was weak, and it requested our assistance in maintaining order. Our military police force stepped on the former territory that had been lost a century ago after the Japanese surrender. Later, the Southwest National Army was ordered to be transferred north in large numbers, passing through Hong Kong and renting private houses in the northern district of Kowloon Tong as temporary barracks. Overseas Chinese witnessed the majestic posture of fully armed National Army troops day and night (before the war, the Hong Kong government had long prohibited armed National Army troops from entering the country), and were very excited. On August 15th, the National Army troops stationed in the Kowloon Tong barracks were ordered to return to Shenzhen, and our military delegation stationed in Hong Kong, the Guangzhou General Headquarters Office in Hong Kong, and other agencies were also announced to be closed. The sudden departure of the National Army from Hong Kong caused much speculation. Some said that the Hong Kong government, in view of the great internal strife in China, and in order to maintain absolute neutrality, did not want to provide the National Army with the convenience of passing through the country. According to reliable sources, the passage of the National Army through Hong Kong was based on an agreement signed with the British in advance, stipulating that it would expire on August 15th of this year, and the National Army returned to the country after the expiration date in order to abide by its promise. Our government allocated 40 million yuan in national currency to Hong Kong to handle education and relief work for the overseas Chinese who had been under the iron heel of the Japanese for three years and eight months. It also registered the wartime losses of overseas Chinese (including military notes) and sought compensation from the Japanese on their behalf. Recently, it also organized US dollar loans to assist in the industrial recovery of overseas Chinese. The Hong Kong Office of the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi was officially established last December, which is a small compensation for the protection of the interests of overseas Chinese, but it still seems necessary to strengthen its work.</p>
<p>During this year, at least two unpleasant incidents occurred between our agencies stationed in Hong Kong and the Hong Kong government, which caused considerable tension: one was the case of Second Lieutenant Rong of the National Army being insulted by Bu Bian, and the other was the incident of the closure of the National Daily, especially the latter which stirred up the whole maple leaf. The newspaper has already reported in detail on this incident, so I will not repeat it here. The case of the real traitor is also a pending case that has been repeatedly negotiated between China and the United Kingdom without a proper outcome. The Hong Kong issue after the war has become a decisive factor in Sino-British relations, and I hope that everyone will unite to support the government so that it can obtain the most reasonable solution.</p>
<p>Now, except for the "Deferred Payment Ordinance," also known as the "Suspension Bill," which has not yet been revoked, Hong Kong can be said to have returned to normal in general after a year of recovery efforts. The pre-war funds frozen by the Deferred Payment Act alone amount to more than 50 million yuan at HSBC. In order to control floating capital, the Hong Kong government has been reluctant to revoke this decree for a long time. This has a considerable impact on the flow of funds, trade development, and industrial prosperity in Hong Kong and China. However, because the relationship between wartime debts and bonds has not been properly resolved, the decree cannot be revoked early. Since the decree has not been revoked, the shares of major Chinese and Western companies in Hong Kong cannot be formally publicly traded. The total value of the shares of major companies before the war was 981,272,471 yuan. According to general estimates, it should now rise to more than 150 billion yuan. Morse, General Manager of HSBC, has called for the revocation of the Deferred Payment Ordinance, and members of the Legislative Council have also discussed it. At the end of August, the Hong Kong government had accepted the proposal passed by the Legislative Council to revoke the bill, which still needs to be approved by the British government before it can be announced, but it is feared that the period will not be far off.</p>
<p>At the beginning of his tenure, the Governor of Hong Kong announced that the Hong Kong government's budget expenditure for the next eleven months would be 75 million yuan, while tax revenue would be less than 40 million yuan. In order to make up for the shortfall, the Hong Kong government considered levying a war tax. In mid-July, the Financial Secretary proposed the fiscal budget for 1946 (ending March 31, 1947), totaling 160,151,665 yuan, which means that the entire population of Hong Kong, which is 1.2 million people, will bear an average of more than 120 yuan per person. It is rumored that the Hong Kong government will continue to levy four types of war taxes from October, including income tax and excessive profit tax, on the grounds that the Pacific Treaty has not yet been signed. If this is true, it remains to be seen whether residents can "afford it" at that time, and the extent of Hong Kong's prosperity can be observed.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Visiting Major Traitors in Prison <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yanbing, Nanjing Dispatch, September 30</p>
<p>Zhou Fohai said: "Writing autobiographies, reading novels, prison life is nothing."</p>
<p>Ding Mocun said: "They escorted us to the east, then to the west. What's there to talk about preferential treatment!"</p>
<p>Last August, after Japan announced its unconditional surrender, a group of senior officials of the puppet National Government were panicked and at a loss, not knowing what method to use to cope with this sudden change. As a result, before the receiving officials arrived, the demons all ran east and west. Only Zhou Fohai, Ding Mocun, and others actually received appointments from the Central Government, ordering Zhou Fohai to be the commander of the Shanghai Action Team of the Military Commission, and Ren Yuandao to be the commander-in-chief of the vanguard army. At the time, many people said that this was a miracle. Subsequently, the work of capturing traitors was actively carried out, and big and small traitors were arrested one after another. Only Zhou and others were escorted to Chongqing. A year later, they were escorted to Nanjing by special plane on the 16th of this month. In the minds of many people, this is another strange celebration.</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM on the 23rd, five "traitor nobles," including Zhou Fohai, Ding Mocun, Luo Junqiang, Ma Jiliang, and Yang Xinghua, were transferred from No. 19 Ninghai Road to the Capital Land Court Detention Center at Lao Chu Bridge. Because of certain relationships, the reporter was allowed to visit the prison for the second time.</p>
<p>They were held in several different numbered prison cells. Zhou, Ding, and Luo were in Zhongzi No. 4, Ma was in No. 3, and Yang was in No. 6. The air and light were adequate. There were also two young servants who were in charge of sweeping and serving during the day, so it was quite tidy. However, the caretakers, cooks, and servants they brought were all left behind, and they could not enjoy special treatment alone, but the national law was still lenient to them after all.</p>
<p>When the reporter arrived at the entrance of the prison cell, Zhou was sitting on the bed, with a rosy complexion, but his spirit was slightly weak. He looked up and saw the reporter, and he actually stood up. The reporter then asked Zhou if he was used to the prison life. He said it was nothing, writing autobiographies, reading novels, and the day passed quickly. Then the reporter asked again:</p>
<p>"Was General Dai Li's death a loss to you?"</p>
<p>Zhou replied silently: "I had a relationship with the Central Government since January of the 32nd year to cover underground work comrades, and to maintain the security of the Jiangnan area after the victory. Only General Dai was the clearest about the Shanghai affairs…"</p>
<p>"Then what about before the 32nd year?" The reporter impatiently interrupted Zhou's words, but he was silent.</p>
<p>Ma and Luo were talking. When they saw the reporter standing at the door, they also stopped talking. Ma turned his head away, seemingly unwilling to let the reporter see his face. Ding took the initiative to come over and join the conversation.</p>
<p>Talking about life in Chongqing, Ding said: "Some people think that our escort to Chongqing was special treatment, otherwise why not escort others? You want to escort us to the east and seal us to the west. Life is so unfree. What's there to talk about preferential treatment!"</p>
<p>"This morning, the High Court summoned you again, right?"</p>
<p>"It's been several times." Zhou said, "Everything about the past is written in the autobiography. Right and wrong, merits and demerits, will be judged fairly." Seeing their kind of peace of mind, and Chen Gongbo not realizing his mistakes until death, can really be regarded as "different tunes played with the same skill."</p>
<p>Because it was the time after lunch when they could move around freely for a while, Lin Baisheng also came out of the Zhongzi House. Lin and Zhou had always been incompatible, so when he saw Zhou today, he retreated. Zhou also said with a disgusted tone: "This strange thing always howls and cries every night, making it impossible for us to sleep. I don't know what he's doing."</p>
<p>"I heard that the court has already sentenced him to death, so he's probably afraid of death!" The reporter inadvertently gave Zhou a strong stimulus. There was a lot of meaning implied, and Zhou was silent. The reporter also hurriedly retreated.</p>
<p>The reporter thought to himself: The life and death of Zhou and others are in the hands of the highest authorities. Even if he had a relationship with the Central Government since January of the 32nd year, covering underground work comrades, and maintaining the security of Jiangnan after the victory, so that the National Army could take over smoothly, he still cannot offset the monstrous crime of treason! What the Chinese people are watching is naturally the handling of them by the traitor trial authorities.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Photo by Our Special Correspondent Zhang Liumei: Xianghe City, That Shocked the World <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Readers should still be able to recall the scene of the Communist army entering Xianghe City when the July 29th Incident occurred. The pictures published here will be used to replace written accusations: (1) During the eight years of the War of Resistance and the current turmoil, although the high walls of Xianghe City still stand here, they are covered with terrible wounds, collapse, and dilapidation, just like the suffering people, and are unbearable to look at. (2) A house at Anping Station on the Pingjin Highway was severely damaged. This is also the trace of the damage caused by the shells during the July 29th Incident. (3) After the Communist army entered Xianghe City, they demolished the city wall and dug a large number of trenches on it. (4) This is the main street of Xianghe, quiet and eerie. If it weren't for the investigation team here, it is likely that a shell would blossom inside.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Cholera Spreads a Black Net in Guilin <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Liang Xiaozhong, Guilin Airmail Dispatch, 11th of this Month</p>
<p>The new grain is hitting the market like a tide, and rice prices are falling tragically, 70,000, 60,000, 40,000, 30,000, 27,000 per dan. The fall in rice prices is lively, and the salary increase for public school teachers is also lively. An average month's salary can buy 500 to 1,000 catties of white rice, which is really affordable. However, provincial-level civil servants may not be able to get their wish, and the provincial government keeps saying "financial deficit," and it looks like it will be discounted again by 30 to 20 percent. Moreover, while rice is cheap, other things have not bowed their heads. The price of one catty of pork is ten times that of one catty of rice, and this can be inferred to other things.</p>
<p>Cholera spread a black net in Guilin, with as many as a thousand patients in half a month. The pitifully poor hospital dared not confirm that it was cholera because it lacked testing equipment and called it "similar to cholera," and this "similar cholera" has made the coffin shop owner laugh so hard that he can't open his eyes to this day. Many people who died from "similar cholera" were wrapped in a mat "similar to a coffin" and carried out to the suburbs because they had no coffin. The hospital's emergency treatment became a mere formality. Due to the lack of medicine, six out of ten patients who entered the hospital would never come out again. Even the hospital's refusal to accept patients became a common occurrence. After a scolding in the newspaper, the next day there would be a "letter of correction" (one person had already died after one correction). This is the doctor's morality.</p>
<p>There is news that is even more shocking than cholera. It turns out that the Communist Party has taken a fancy to the Yao Mountain area bordering Lingchuan, Xiuren, and other counties, and is transporting batches of military supplies into it, preparing to act when the time is right. Unfortunately, the plan was not secret, but a full house was raided in Lingchuan County. Speaking of which, I feel a little disappointed for the Communist Party. I dare to say one thing: the Communist Party is definitely not "doing nothing" in Guangxi, especially the tail that is waving the flag and shouting, which can be said to be renewing itself day by day. I don't know how to write a neutral statement, but I believe that the love and hatred of the public is also my personal love and hatred. If I were to say something more objectively, I would tell you: "No one in Guangxi does not hate the Communist Party."</p>
<p>Commissioner Ni Zhongtao, who was good at killing county magistrates, was tried in public. He had been running around beforehand, and defended himself eloquently during the defense. Finally, with the strong support of Fang Yuan, he was lightly sentenced to eleven years in prison. Eleven years is not a long time, and Commissioner Ni is waiting for a general amnesty, or a "small amnesty."</p>

<h3 id="e161">Examination of Maps <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— A Word of Caution</p>
<p>Chinese education does not pay much attention to geography. For example, the so-called main courses in schools are Chinese, arithmetic, and English. As for geography and history, it does not hinder promotion if you fail. Therefore, the concept of the nation's territory is very weak in the minds of Chinese youth. In the past, the enemy took our Northeast and even North China, and we southerners did not feel it seriously, and we simply did not know the importance of these places in geography. We are too negligent in our knowledge of geography.</p>
<p>Let's look at how much the Japanese valued the study of geography in the past. It is said that in Japan, you can find a bookstore that specializes in selling Chinese maps. During the occupation of Beijing and Shanghai, the first thing the enemy did in education was to replace geography textbooks and confiscate maps from bookstores and libraries. Under this painful contrast, we ourselves feel ashamed even though we have won.</p>
<p>Recently, it was reported that the "World New Situation Map" published by the Shanghai World and Earth Society contains numerous errors, such as still recognizing Taiwan and Korea as Japanese territories, and mistakenly including important areas west of the Congling Mountains to the Jiangxinpo area within the borders of other countries. This absurdity has made the government unable to tolerate it. Isn't this absurd to the extreme? If you don't even have this basic knowledge, how can you be qualified to compile maps? This also shows how neglected our country has been in geography in the past.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Interior has re-amended the "Regulations on the Examination of Land and Sea Maps," stipulating that all maps must be examined and approved before they can be registered and issued. This is a passive measure. We propose that the National Compilation and Translation Bureau should jointly organize a Land and Sea Map Compilation Committee with the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Interior, and hire well-known geography experts to compile the latest maps and geography textbooks, and that the education curriculum standards should stipulate that those who fail geography should not be promoted or graduated, so that the Chinese people can pay attention to the teaching of geography.</p>
<h3 id="e162">A New Discussion of Democracy <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Haoran</p>
<p>Published by the Da Dong Bookstore for Illiterate People in Jiangxi</p>
<p>Since the defeat of fascism in World War II, democratic politics, long scorned, have once again become fashionable. Both left and right wings are shouting about democracy at top volume. However, in the aftermath of the First World War, instead of the established democracies of Britain, the United States, and France, extreme nationalism in the form of Nazism or Fascism arose, along with Communism which promoted class struggle. The current international situation is even more precarious than at the end of the First World War. Even if the Nazis or Fascists do not make a comeback anytime soon, whether the democracy promoted by totalitarianism is truly more progressive than British democracy, and whether we should adopt it instead of the Anglo-American model, is a question worth examining. This book provides us with a very good source to investigate this issue.</p>
<p>The Spirit of Democracy</p>
<p>This book begins with "The Ethics of Democracy." Chapters one to three analyze concepts like freedom, equality, rights, and obligations, demonstrating that "democracy has, from the beginning, a moral content and a noble purpose." Chapter four emphasizes the importance of "cultivating political ethics," saying that "the fundamental problem in practicing democracy is how to make the replacement of administrative power follow established rules... To make politics sound, besides establishing institutions, it is especially necessary to strive to obtain capable people, and beyond that, to cultivate good political ethics." It then points out "public-mindedness," "fairness," "frankness," and "tolerance" as the main conditions for cultivating political ethics. Chapter five suggests that "the spirit of an ideal citizen is based on the development of a sense of public service." Recently, Ambassador Stuart said to reporters: "Democracy is the best system in the world, but if it is not responsible, it is also the worst system in the world." This is a warning to us to quickly cultivate a "sense of public service."</p>
<p>Next, "Looking at Democracy from Reality" is divided into five chapters. Chapter six discusses the difference between democratic countries and dictatorships, as well as the causes of dictatorial politics, and then proposes a suggestion for democratic countries to prevent dictatorial aggression: "Only by simultaneously increasing the government's authority to deal with economic crises, and appropriately limiting this authority, with both authority and responsibility having rational regulations, can politics be kept in balance forever." But how to increase the government's authority and how to add reasonable limitations to it? This is a major task of completely adjusting or reforming the entire structure of democratic countries, but it does not provide a concrete plan, leaving it to human wisdom to study. Originally, political systems often differ greatly due to different national conditions, and cannot be generalized. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, assessing the global situation and observing our historical and social background, advocated the "separation of power and ability," where the people have power and the government has ability, and proposed a Five-Power Constitution and a concrete plan for the National Assembly, which may be the greatest contribution of human wisdom and is worth considering.</p>
<p>Freedom of Speech</p>
<p>Chapter seven argues that freedom of speech is important to democracy, refuting the impropriety of those who oppose freedom of speech, and advocating giving freedom of speech to minorities. It says, "The life of a country's politics is largely entrusted to an excellent minority. Their politically heterodox behavior and unique opinions often become reflections of political measures. Maintaining political balance is definitely not about suppressing or suppressing minorities, but about tolerating or protecting minorities." This is not only a wake-up call for those in power in democratic countries, but also a motto for the general "sovereign people." Not only should maintaining political balance be done this way, but also to prevent the transfer of power from becoming a bloody revolution, it must be done this way. Only when minorities have real freedom of speech can minority parties hope to become majority parties; only then can the theory that political power changes according to public opinion be realized peacefully. Otherwise, under a democratic system where the minority obeys the majority, minority parties will never have the hope of becoming majority parties and will inevitably resort to armed revolution. Chapter eight discusses whether the "wartime parliamentary system" should be respected, and its conclusion is that it should be respected. Chapter nine discusses "the diplomacy of democratic countries," advocating breaking secret diplomacy and placing it under the supervision of political parties. From the perspective of democratic principles, these two points are natural. However, from experience, speed is of the essence in war, and the problem of people is always more important than the problem of law. If the right people are obtained, then it is good if the British Parliament establishes a National Expenditure Audit Committee during World War II to supervise the government's military actions. Just as during World War I, the British Parliament did not control the George Cabinet, and the US Congress did not control President Wilson, there was nothing major that occurred, and sometimes it was even felt that it was convenient to rush to war. As for the fact that diplomacy and military affairs are related, it also depends on who is speaking. In today's world where international wars cannot be eliminated, how easy is it to eliminate secret diplomacy; even Roosevelt, who advocated democracy the most, could not avoid falling into the old-fashioned diplomatic trap. The Three-Power Agreement on Chinese sovereignty reached at the Yalta Conference was not announced until half a year after the war, which is a clear example, and others are even less worthy of mention. We believe that to fully realize this ideal of open diplomacy, we must first find a way to realize world peace and abolish war.</p>
<p>Freedom from War</p>
<p>Chapter ten discusses "Democratic Ideals and Peace," explaining the importance of the relationship between democracy and peace, and then investigates the main reasons why international peace cannot be realized. It believes that (1) because under conditions of economic inequality, the attitudes between "haves" and "have-nots" are fundamentally different, and they have no common ideals, so they will not cooperate for peace. (2) Because the "individual liberalism" of democratic countries is applied to the international stage, they are unwilling to accept any restrictions on sovereignty. In this way, even if any international organization is temporarily established, it will ultimately be short-lived. This is indeed a famous saying that sees the crux of the problem. But we would also like to add one point: the concept of "checks and balances" in the democratic system should also be considered a factor in creating the current international situation. Because this concept originates from mutual suspicion and jealousy, and divides power to check each other; if there is a spirit of the rule of law domestically to maintain it, it can still be safe. When applied to the international arena, it evolves into a "balance of power" policy; without the spirit of the rule of law to maintain it, it relies entirely on the military and political balance of power to support it. Once the balance of power is broken, war will follow. The course of the First and Second World Wars can be used as an annotation. As for saying: "The failure of the international community is due to the lack of determination and courage of Britain and France, who reluctantly avoided war and did not hesitate to appease the aggressions of Germany, Japan, and Italy by kneeling and retreating," that is still a superficial view and does not conform to the facts. In fact, the British and French internally were first fighting for magic weapons and creating a balance of power. When the balance of power could not be maintained, retreat was not possible, and taking a tough attitude was also not necessarily effective. It must be understood that Westerners have always liked to show strength and act rashly and are unwilling to show weakness. Now the United States, learning from the previous mistakes of Britain and France being weak towards the Axis powers, has greatly changed its style and wants to use a strong policy to prevent Soviet expansion. But there are still people shouting loudly, saying that if things continue like this, they are afraid that it will lead to a third world war.</p>
<p>Freedom from Hunger</p>
<p>Next, "The Economic View of Democracy" is discussed. Some places have largely accepted the theories of the revisionist school of Marxism. Chapter eleven discusses the bourgeoisie and democracy; chapter twelve discusses freedom and the economic system, and after comparing capitalism and Marxism in detail, it determines that capitalism is not enough to guarantee the stability of the lives of the masses and allow democracy to flourish; but it is also definitely not something that can be achieved by using class struggle.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I believe that the "liberal planned economy" that developed from this war and a kind of socialism that the British Labour Party cabinet is now promoting are indeed very worthy of our reference. Then Mr. Wang's saying that "democratic countries reluctantly implementing a planned economy are at least temporarily abandoning the spirit of responsible government" and "the tendency of dictatorial politics is to adopt socialist methods to open up the path to extreme authoritarianism" seems to be worrying about something that might not happen. However, this only seems easy to say in Britain and the United States, where democracy has deep roots. If it were in other countries, would the bourgeoisie be willing to easily give up the rights they have already obtained? I'm afraid it's a big question. The best thing is to follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's "Principle of People's Livelihood," like our country, at a time when capitalism and socialism have not yet taken shape; while increasing production, we should prevent unequal distribution during the process of increasing production. I earnestly advise the ruling officials not to miss this opportunity. Chapter twelve explains the reasons why Marxism is still stimulating today, and makes deep and clear statements; it can make those who worship Marx deeply reflect.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Reading "The Stream of Thought" <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>Book Title: On the Stream of Thought</p>
<p>Original Author: W. James</p>
<p>Translator: Tang Cheng</p>
<p>Publisher: Commercial Press</p>
<p>Publication Date: First edition in Chongqing, April 1945</p>
<p>"On the Stream of Thought" is a translation by the translator of Chapter 9, "The Stream of Thought," from W. James' "Principles of Psychology." James is a highly acclaimed psychologist in modern America, and his contribution to the psychology of emotion is significant. He initially studied medicine at Harvard University, later dedicating himself to the study of the relationship between the physiology of the nervous system and psychology, eventually becoming a philosopher and psychologist of Pragmatism.</p>
<p>Although James' "Principles of Psychology" was published a considerable time ago, its status in the academic community is not diminished by the fact that it is not a new work. Time cannot extinguish the life of a great work, so the Western Philosophy Famous Works Translation Committee of the Chinese Philosophical Society selected and translated James' famous works into a series. In addition to "On the Stream of Thought," there are also single volumes such as "On Habit," "On Emotion," "On Self-Consciousness," and "On Will," which will be published in succession.</p>
<p>This thin booklet of over eighty pages allows one to discover the author's unique system of thought on psychology. He studies psychology from the perspective of physiology and anatomy, breaking the traditional concept of psychologists talking empty-headedly about "consciousness" and delving into the mysterious, laying the foundation for the physiological study of psychology. He particularly studies the influence of thought processes on a person's psychology, and also provides strong arguments for psychology from philosophy. He says that the most basic psychological fact is that there is a thought process taking place, and people's thought processes dominate their psychological activities.</p>
<p>In "On the Stream of Thought," the author elucidates five characteristics of thought. Everyone's thoughts proceed along these five characteristics. The five characteristics of thought he mentions are summarized as: (1) Every thought has a tendency to become a part of personal consciousness. (2) Within each person's consciousness, thoughts are always changing. (3) Within each person's consciousness, thoughts feel continuous. (4) Human thoughts appear to be responding to objects independent of thought. (5) Thought is interested in some parts of these objects, ignores the rest, and accepts or rejects them from moment to moment—selecting among these objects.</p>
<p>From the first characteristic, it is clarified that thoughts are not completely independent of each other, nor are they all connected as one. Thoughts are naturally not isolated. Each thought is with some other thoughts, completely separated from other thoughts. The state of consciousness that we study can only be seen from each specific special me and you. Since every thought has a tendency to become personal, we must grasp the development of thought.</p>
<p>The second characteristic discussed by James believes that thought is constantly changing. Our state of consciousness is constantly changing. No state of consciousness, once past, can be reproduced. At one moment we are listening, at another moment we are looking, at one moment we are reasoning, at another moment we are recalling, at one moment we are loving, at another moment we are hating. The purpose of science is to simplify the complex. The "Theory of Ideas" in psychology is formed by the combination of certain simple and unchanging elements of consciousness that are different from each other. The author believes that every thought we have about a fact is always unique. It is only similar in kind to our other thoughts about the same fact. When the same fact reappears, we must think of it in a new way and look at it from different perspectives.</p>
<p>The author further explains in the third characteristic of thought that everyone's thoughts always feel continuous. Even if there is a break in thought in time, the consciousness after the break always feels that it is connected to the consciousness before the break.</p>
<p>From the continuity and unity of thought, James further developed his fourth characteristic: human thought is responding to objects independent of thought. In other words, thought contains cognitive function. The reason we believe that the objects of our thoughts have a copy of the outside world is that there are multiple human thoughts in the world, each with the same object. The judgment "my thought and his thought have the same object" is the reason why psychologists believe that our thought knows an external object.</p>
<p>In the fifth characteristic, James further explains the selection function of consciousness. Consciousness is always more concerned with some parts of its objects than with other parts, and consciousness often accepts one part and rejects other parts during all the time it thinks. Selective attention and deliberate will are clear examples of the selective activity of thought. All our perceptions have intonation and weight. James also discusses moral concepts, believing that the selection function of thought is above all else. If an action is not selected and practiced from several equally possible actions, then this action has no moral value.</p>
<p>Overall, James' discussion of the characteristics of thought is indeed an important document in the history of philosophy and psychology. In order to confirm the status of concrete experience in psychology, he used physiological and philosophical viewpoints to criticize the traditional view at the time that the results of analysis (such as sensation) were the only psychological reality. He opposed both sensationalism, which believed that a person's state of consciousness only consisted of sensory impressions, and rationalism, which believed that these impressions must be synthesized by a pure intellectual function that is much higher than themselves to have unity. He insisted on his argument: everyone's thoughts are continuous, it is a constant stream. The unity and synthesis of thought are analyzed in detail by James, which can be said to be a major revolution in the psychological community.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Reading "Sardine" <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Fang</p>
<p>This thin book—"Sardine," is written by Mr. Ba Jin. After reading it, I did not find comfort, but only increased some emotions, perhaps, that is my comfort!</p>
<p>The protagonist in the book, Brother Sheng Yi, is one of those despised as sardines. He is a young man in his twenties. He certainly believed Mr. Zhang's claim that there were ways to make money in the mine, "at least three to five hundred yuan a year," for his own life and future, and left his home and Sister Yin, which he did not want to leave. Sister Yin is his fiancée, a kind and gentle woman, who was initially not at all willing to let him go to dig tin and crawl around underground, out of sight of the sun, especially fearing that his eyes would go blind. However, Sheng Yi was now single-mindedly thinking about the bright silver coins, so many and so crisply ringing. He always thought that Sister Yin's worries were due to excessive love and too much concern because he deeply believed that the forty-something Mr. Zhang (a colleague in the mine) was a good person and would not deceive him. He also planned: to work for two years, no more than seven hundred and several ten days, which would pass quickly. He could get thousands of yuan or the gold and silver treasures he imagined under the mine to settle down his family. In Sheng Yi himself, this was naturally a consistent intuitive thought.</p>
<p>However, Sister Yin always hesitated, thinking, "I won't be able to see this young and beautiful face or hear this gentle and crisp voice within two years. He will go alone to an unfamiliar place to do unfamiliar work, leaving her alone in the public hall to suffer, without any comfort! Comfort! Maybe something will happen during this period, even shattering his entire plan," and therefore was unwilling and almost cried for several days to keep him from going. Finally, Sheng Yi, through all kinds of efforts with his positive thoughts and the words "two years is very short, not long at all, it will pass easily," moved her heart, and she had no choice but to let him go.</p>
<p>Sheng Yi finally left one morning with a group of companions. They walked into the shadowy mountain valley of cliffs, the so-called "dead city," which was located here. All day long, they walked windingly in the remote mountains. Of course, it was very bitter. Their fellow travelers, Lao Zhang, Xiao Wang, and Wu Hongfa, had all kowtowed to Zhao Er's ancestral temple, asking this founder of the mine to bless and take care of them. After walking for one or two days, they arrived at their destination one afternoon—the mining area. However, even the children in the places they passed scolded them, chattering and clamoring that a new batch of "sardines" had arrived. This sentence made them uncomfortable and very angry because they saw that those wild children had a frivolous look and certainly were not well-intentioned. Therefore, they forged their first bad impression. Fatigue and hunger urged them on, so they were sent to a large house, not very bright, and gloomy. They rested on the ground for a while and then squatted on the ground to eat.</p>
<p>Work began. Whether it was raining or sunny, from morning to night, they worked day after day. They had no leisure, no entertainment. At night, they only went to the gambling den to seek a trace of fun. The gambling den was ultimately a place to spend money and cause trouble. Xiao Wang, a companion, was shot and killed by stray bullets in the gambling den. But this matter, Xiao Wang died, was only discovered after they ran away from the gambling den as a group. When they wanted to look for him, they were stopped by that pointed-headed, insidious, triangular-faced mine supervisor. He said, "Are you afraid that no one will bury him?" This group of suffering friends, from then on, suffered another kind of deeper and more inconceivable threat.</p>
<p>In the dark underground work, with gas lamps lit, the pit was damp. As a result, in addition to the darkness and the smell emitted from the ore, there was no good feeling. Hard days really came, the dead died, and the beaten were injured. But other than dying to end it, you can't think of resting or being happy for even a moment. The longer the time, the harder the days, and those despised as sardines were even more bored. Thinking of their despair for their families, they felt even more meaningless. Sheng Yi missed his lovely Sister Yin even more, and finally, he went from being uninterested in "life" to being passive, feeling that death was gradually approaching. Just as the original work wrote: "Because, at any time, every sardine is oppressed by that shadow, that shadow grabs their souls like a ghost."</p>
<p>The shadows gradually gathered, and life gradually changed. They ate poorly, slept poorly, and the work became more and more difficult. A heavy rain finally came, causing the mine pit to be like a lake, a water prison. The pitch-black water became deeper and deeper, and bigger and bigger. They also abandoned their most hated heavy mining hoes and fled towards the mine entrance. This was certainly a chance to escape that they had been seeking, but ultimately they risked finding a way out in the torrential flood.</p>
<p>Everyone disassembled their lives and swam forward. Their mid-way companion—the Scabby Monk, certainly had a silly strength to climb out of the abyss. Lao Zhang couldn't resist the force of the water and was washed away by the rapids and rocks. Then, with a few sounds of water; even Sheng Yi, who was pitifully calling Sister Yin's name, disappeared. How pitiful he was, and how pitiful his companions were, and how even more pitiful that their wishes would be forever shattered in this tribulation. Sister Yin suffered from heavy labor and the ravages of loneliness and died long ago in less than a year!</p>

<h3 id="e165">The Creation of Character <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Pingling</p>
<p>Dwelling on the deeds of ancient history, imagining the historical figures who created those deeds, casually grabbing one out, describing whether his face is red or white, whether his voice is like a woman or a cat's meow, what kind of clothes he likes, whether he has a beard, this kind of technique is just to draw the outline of the character based on one's own imagination, and does not count as creating the character's personality.</p>
<p>The characteristics of a character, though no more than the following types: happy, melancholy, decisive, hesitant, admonishing, fragile, truthful, hypocritical, kind, cruel, generous, narrow-minded... etc., relative aspects; undoubtedly are shaped by acquired sensibilities, to answer with clear words, is that, in order for humans to fight for existence, they must possess several conditions so that they can closely adapt to the environment of reality, and seek out resources for life in the surging tides of life. Therefore, a person's character is often unavoidably impacted by the torrents of life or gradually deteriorates in the melting pot of the times, losing its original authenticity. For example, a familiar friend moves from place A to place B, and when you meet him again after a few years, his voice and smile may still be the same, but after a little interaction, you will definitely feel that his character has completely changed. This is because, for the sake of life, one has to make one's character more adapted to the demands of reality. Based on this meaning, if writers want to create realistic characters in their works, so that readers do not feel the unfamiliarity and estrangement of the characters, but rather feel that they are lifelike, with blood, flesh, and soul, then you must know the times, experience life, thoroughly understand everything related to life, and swim in the sea of ​​reality at all times.</p>
<p>It is not impossible to create the character of a person from ancient history; but one must collect reliable historical facts, meanings, the spirit of that era, experience the life and habits of that era, and deeply research the impact of the character to be created in that era; only then can the expressed character not be a clay sculpture or wooden carving of a god, but also a person with blood and flesh. Like Sima Qian's description of Xiang Yu, Luo Guanzhong's depiction of Guan Gong, and Shi Nai'an's setting off of Song Jiang, they are very true and close to emotions, and there is absolutely no trace of "deification." This is because they are able to meet the spirit of the ancients and discover the reality of history.</p>
<p>If writers lack a correct philosophical viewpoint as a balance to understand the times and experience life, and if they cannot use imagination, observation, analysis, synthesis, and other methods to find the truth of the facts, then even if you describe the facts that happen today, you may not be able to grasp reality; even if you treat yourself as the object of depiction, it will be like nothingness and ethereal, and you will never be able to get close to reality.</p>
<p>Creating a person's character, because the writer's viewpoints are different, the methods of handling it will also be different. For example: some historians who like to write reversal articles say that Yue Fei was a warmonger, while Qin Hui, who advocated peace, was a loyal minister of the Song Dynasty; Guo Moruo, in his recent play "Qu Yuan," portrays the romantic and suave Song Yu like a clown, a despicable and shameless courtier. Due to the different viewpoints of the writers, they often make the described characters close to innovating and completely deviating from the norm. As for whether it is reasonable, that is the responsibility of the critics.</p>
<p>The responsibility of writers lies in clarifying right and wrong, distinguishing hypocrisy, pursuing light, and indicating truth. The creation of a person's character is entirely based on correct knowledge and according to the development of the story, never infiltrating personal prejudices and biases. However, once it is finalized, the writers should stand on an objective position. They must hate and curse the characters on the dark side and strike them mercilessly; they should do their best to praise and commend the characters on the bright side and sing their praises with utmost care. In this way, the described characters can live on paper and gain deep resonance and reaction in the minds of readers.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Farewell <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Zi</p>
<p>"Knowing that this separation is inevitable, let's turn tears into smiles!" Even as she said this, her eyes still shimmered with crystalline tears. Indeed, it is better to smile than to weep; parting, whether temporary or permanent, is inherently painful. However, sending someone off with a smile carries a deeper resonance and a sense of resignation.</p>
<p>This happened several years ago. Memory has been diluted by time, but that wistful smile still captivates the heart.</p>
<p>In the course of life, almost every step involves a separation, whether it's a temporary absence or a permanent parting. We encounter many strangers every day. We might only cross paths with these people once, or we might meet again. Even if we do, our memories will be hazy. Sometimes we come across a beautiful girl, and we are drawn to her beauty, unable to resist glancing at her. In her eyes, we might also perceive a faint hint of wistfulness. Yes, in this infinitely vast expanse of time and space, a chance encounter is undoubtedly a form of destiny. But this fleeting opportunity vanishes in an instant, impossible to grasp. In our lives, there are countless such farewells – silent, tearless, sometimes evoking regret in the hazy memories of the future. But why regret? Why regret?</p>
<p>Life is a bitter taste compounded of various flavors, just like black is a composite of different colors. But if we carefully examine it, we can still see traces of different colors within the black – tarnished red, darkened green, scattered purple. And parting, whether temporary or permanent, is like a deep red star twinkling against a background of deep gray.</p>
<p>This starlight represents a hope, a dream – that those who part may reunite, and that those who die may meet again in another world. Everything in this world is unknowable. Within this unknowability lies infinite suffering, but perhaps also a bit of unexpected joy. When true reunions occur, these deep red stars will collide and dazzle each other, like fireworks in the night, illuminating the true face of life.</p>
<p>When friends and relatives gather, I fear the mention of farewells, yet I myself unconsciously tend to bring it up. At such times, the emotion of parting is already dimly felt in everyone's hearts. Just a mention from someone is like the sound of a short flute, gradually awakening the silent violins, the deep double basses, and then the drums and piano, evolving into a grand symphony of parting.</p>
<p>If we observe life with an exploring eye, we can see many mysterious and incomprehensible things. And parting is the most mysterious of the mysterious. Is it governed by human will, or by fate? It always stands within our circle of life, threading together those scattered days into a continuous, systematic string – a string of mysterious pearls, a string of crystalline tears. To seek that wistful smile through these glistening tears is almost heartbreaking.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Windmill <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— By Emile Verhaeren, translated by Da Chun</p>
<p>The windmill slowly, slowly turns in the depths of the night,</p>
<p>Set against a melancholy and worried sky.</p>
<p>It turns and turns, its crimson-purple sails,</p>
<p>Hold endless worry, weakness, stagnation, and weariness.</p>
<p>After dawn, its arms stretch out as if begging for pity,</p>
<p>Rising and falling in turns.</p>
<p>Now again in that gray space,</p>
<p>Sinking in the heavy stupor of nature that seems dead.</p>
<p>Over several villages sleeps a sickly winter day,</p>
<p>Clouds are tired of restless journeys;</p>
<p>Many small woods are gathering their shadows,</p>
<p>And heading to the ends of death are those ruts.</p>
<p>By the ancient pond are a few beech cottages,</p>
<p>Pitifully huddled around;</p>
<p>A copper lamp hangs under the ceiling,</p>
<p>And smiles slip out of the window and from the top of the wall.</p>
<p>On the vast plain, by the quietly sleeping water,</p>
<p>These impoverished huts are peering,</p>
<p>With their poor eyes of glass.</p>
<p>The old windmill turns a circle tired, then turns another and stops.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Dock (Woodcut) <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>

<h3 id="e169">Fragrant Grass, Setting Sun (Plus One Chapter) <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Lianyuan</p>
<p>All afternoon, I dissipated my persistent loneliness in the faint mist exhaled by cigarettes.</p>
<p>...Is this possible? Escaping the clutches of worldly customs, isolating myself far from the bustling city, I love how the trees beyond the wall are burned crimson by the setting sun. In the crimson clouds, a smile flashes; when I stare again, the setting sun hurrying home takes that smile away. So this forest is like a theater after the curtain has fallen, leaving behind a floating life tormented by loneliness and desolation. And that smile, ah, can never be found again in the forest. Yes, I have lost that smile.</p>
<p>Wise men have long told us that life only has a fleeting moment that cannot be repeated, and eternity will not fade! Yes, the smile that flashes in the setting sun is like the eternal smile on a lover's lips as they pass away, but this smile is like weeping, a steel-like brand etched into memory. Seeing this smile is more sorrowful than crying all night. I am like a flowering tree at the end of autumn, having lost the protection of dew. A tree of flowers and leaves is like a poetic verse, the withering flowers and leaves murmur: fragrant grass, setting sun, tomorrow is long in coming! ...</p>
<p>Thinking, the cigarette butt suddenly falls from my fingers, and the ashes scatter by the side of the chair. Alas, I am tired of listening to lingering songs. Just as I lower my head to pick up the fallen cigarette butt, I look up and really see a smile, like a flower blooming in the third month of spring, adorning her face. The picked-up cigarette butt slips again, and just as my eyes escape the encirclement of the blue smoke, I truly greet a smile, a smile descending from heaven, so I bid farewell to the oppressive loneliness, and throw the unlit cigarettes into the fire.</p>
<p>All afternoon, without cigarettes, the fragrant grass and setting sun all become fleeting clouds.</p>
<p>Purple Umbrella</p>
<p>All afternoon, the overcast sky tells a story of demons and monsters. The rain and mist are hazy, and I really worry that it is the ancient, longing wife, Lady White Snake, casting a spell. The beautiful asphalt road and the tram stop are surrounded by holy water. I mock this modern means of transportation, so bitterly made fun of by the sudden holy water. A group of people stand like storks at the station, expressionless, gazing blankly at the surrounding holy water. The story in the sky becomes more and more absurd, and the entire overcast sky seems to be about to press down. I worry that I might have a nightmare-like feeling: is the end of mankind near?</p>
<p>"Ding-ding-dang-dang," the tram bell rings, trying to break through the holy water and speed past. Turning my head, I glimpse a delicate face sheltering under a purple umbrella. With a wave of her hand, she closes the purple umbrella, and the delicate face shines with a cold radiance in the dim sky, nimbly stepping into the carriage. Large raindrops immediately fall, shaking off the confusing nightmare, and I also step into the carriage. "Ding-ding-dang-dang," I am happy that I have once again embarked on a journey.</p>
<p>People who live in crowds all day long also embrace boundless loneliness. For whom do they smile and weep? Pedestrian holding a purple umbrella, please tell me, as you wipe away the raindrops lingering in your hair, someone is rejoicing that you are wiping away the tears in his eyes. The road certainly has no end, and although this train has an end, it will still return, and the crowds are immortal. Purple umbrella, raindrops on the umbrella, raindrops in the hair, your silent plea makes me shed tears.</p>
<p>You are just silently looking at the place you want to go, and I don't want to explore where you want to go. But, where am I going? Answer me, looking at your cold and delicate face, I am once again trapped in a nightmare.</p>
<p>The absurd story being told in the sky should also have an ending. When the purple umbrella moves along a row of fences overgrown with ivy, the sky brightens, and the purple shadow also disappears into the brightness.</p>
<h3 id="e170">An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 51 <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>I held onto Dingyuan, crouching down at the foot of the big tree, while the others scattered to find places to lie low. The branches and leaves above my head were thick, so I couldn't see the sky, but I could hear a buzzing sound approaching from the west, like a small squadron of fighter planes, firing their machine guns intermittently as they flew. At this time, the gunfire in the large forest ahead had stopped. I thought that this squadron was just passing through and would fly away in a few minutes. Who knew that this hateful group would keep circling over our area? Maybe it was because they had heard the sound of heavy machine guns just now? After about twenty minutes of this, they fired another burst of machine guns before slowly heading east.</p>
<p>"These things are so hateful!" Dingyuan hadn't been speaking, but now he opened his mouth, shaking his head at me with a smile. I understood why he had this bit of a smile. You've probably experienced it before: sometimes you encounter a mischievous child, or a shameless rascal, who makes trouble for you, and it's hard to deal with him until he finally leaves. You're in front of your friends, feeling annoyed but also embarrassed to be seriously angry. What do you do? You probably just have to laugh it off. Dingyuan's smile, I think, was of this nature.</p>
<p>I could now see the young leader clearly. He had a missing earlobe on his left ear and bright eyes, with a few traces of elegance. He came running out and gave an order: everyone get back in the cars and proceed in the original order. Each of our cars had a symbol on the windshield, so we weren't stopped by our army's sentries and patrols along the way.</p>
<p>After passing Tiancun, the cars turned south along the highway. The sky was gloomy and oppressive, making me feel like a stone was pressing on my chest, very uncomfortable. After a while, the cars turned southwest again, speeding along. The sound of artillery fire grew louder with each step. When we reached an intersection, we saw that the road to the Yongding River Bridge was blocked by tree branches and scattered wood. Our cars had to stop. At this time, two brothers on the sentry post waved to us, as if telling us to retreat back the way we came. As they waved, they ran toward our cars. Our young leader also got out of the car to meet them. I looked carefully ahead again and saw that there seemed to be some rough defensive works along the roadside, and some brothers were lying there. I thought, this isn't good. This is northwest of Wanping, at least five kilometers away in a straight line. The artillery fire is so close, and there are signs of defenses here. In other words, the front line at Wanping is probably unstable.</p>
<p>After talking with the sentries, the young leader immediately ran to my car, saying that there had been changes in the battle situation at Wanping, and there were stray bullets on this road past the bridge. He asked me, "Do you want to take the long way around, or take this road?" I didn't dare turn around to ask Dingyuan for his opinion, so I just braced myself and replied, "Let's rush past!"</p>
<p>As soon as the cars crossed the bridge, we saw that the fields, hillsides, and riverbanks were like ants, the villagers from all directions, men, women, old, and young, rushing westward. Further ahead, I found bodies lying by the fields. A little further, there was indeed a hissing sound. It was stray bullets flying overhead.</p>
<p>"Huh!" Dingyuan seemed to wake up from a dream. "I remember we took the east side of Wanping this morning, and didn't hear many stray bullets. Now we're on the west side, more than ten li away, how can there be stray bullets?... There should be stray bullets at Changxindian too!..."</p>
<p>How could I answer him? His nerves were very weak, and he was tired after a day like this. If I told him the truth, something very bad might happen. You might say, "Shouldn't you have stopped him from going back to Changxindian?" I agree with this too, but what if there were many unexpected problems in Changxindian that had to be decided by him personally? What would we do then? Besides, he has a strong personality, and he's not a child, so you can't just manipulate him."</p>
<p>"Maybe the front lines have shifted a bit..." I said this lightly. As for the rest, he could just think about it himself.</p>
<p>"So, how's Changxindian?... It's a pity you didn't call before we left Beiping!" His expression gradually became tense.</p>
<p>"It wouldn't have helped, would it?... Because things in war change in an instant... Maybe Changxindian isn't in the target area for now?"</p>

<h3 id="e171">Illegally Gained Assets <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The issue of appropriately reserving living expenses for family members during the confiscation of illegally gained assets is still under discussion by relevant authorities and has not yet reached a concrete regulation.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that the person in charge believes there are many difficulties. For example, the amount of illegally gained assets varies greatly. If a fixed amount of living expenses is stipulated, and the total value of many illegally gained assets is less than this amount, what should be done? If a percentage is stipulated, and one-thousandth of many illegally gained assets is enough for the family to live a luxurious life with plenty to spare, what should be done?</p>
<p>From this perspective, it seems very thorny. In fact, those who consider it difficult have not grasped the core of the problem. We know that the reason for reserving a certain amount of living expenses for family members in the Regulations on Punishing Traitors is nothing more than the intention of "punishment not extending to wife and children." Based on this compassionate legal intent, the amount of traitors' assets is by no means the focus of our attention when dealing with them. We only ask whether the assets left are sufficient for the family to live on.</p>
<p>Normally, living expenses have a standard. This standard should be used to determine the amount to be left. If the total value of the illegally gained assets is insufficient, there is no reason for the government to subsidize it. If the amount of illegally gained assets is very large, the family's living expenses should not be increased simply because the total value is large.</p>
<p>It is said that the Illegally Gained Assets Disposal Committee will hold a meeting tomorrow to discuss this matter. I would like to offer this humble opinion to the committee members for reference.</p>

<h3 id="e172">The Origin and Tracks of Scalpers <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Dunfu</p>
<p>Recently, the scalpers in this city seem to be rampant and invincible. Let's start with two recent news stories about "scalpers":</p>
<p>One is that the Shanghai Fish Market sent staff to the North Railway Station to transport arriving fish, but they were intercepted and extorted by several "scalper party members." As a result, the fish market staff reported to the police, who went to suppress them, and only then did the situation calm down.</p>
<p>The other is that a reporter from the Greater America Evening News discovered a certain ×× and a scalper party member hiding in a nearby alley in front of the Great World Theater, dividing the spoils. Just as another ×× wanted to "get a share of the pie," they almost got into a fight. Furthermore, when two scalper party members were trying to sell tickets to the reporter, a certain ×× was enthusiastically encouraging him from the side.</p>
<p>From the first news story, we can see that the potential power of the scalpers is quite "illustrious." They actually "occupy territory" and demand that people passing through their "sphere of influence" pay a "toll"!</p>
<p>From the second news story, it is evident that some ×× are actually acting as "echo chambers" and "tails" for the scalpers! With their wings already formed, and colluding with each other, it is naturally "smooth sailing" and "they are in their element."</p>
<p>What are "scalpers"? The term "scalper" was originally used by Shanghainese to describe people who "have no shoulders" (meaning irresponsible), slippery scalpers, and playboys. The formation of the "scalper party" probably occurred during the enemy-puppet period, with its "place of origin" being the North Railway Station. At that time, railway transportation was chaotic and buying tickets was as difficult as ascending to the heavens! When you were carrying your suitcase, squeezed in the long line, sweating profusely, and feeling like you had nowhere to go, someone would hang around you with a cunning smile, softly asking you, "Where are you going?" He would pull out a large stack of tickets, asking exorbitant prices. In desperation, you would have to grit your teeth and make a deal with him. At that time, there were many "party members" selling black market tickets – the once-famous "black hats" – and they were somewhat organized. Smart Shanghainese people gave them the elegant nickname "scalper party." Although the puppet government also "explicitly" banned them, and "Lord Luo Qingtian" seemed to have "privately investigated" once, publicly executing a "party member" as "a warning to others," his subordinates "did not spare any effort," and the unlucky "martyrs" were, after all, still the founders of the scalper party.</p>
<p>Cannot Be Ignored Therefore, the scalper party gradually expanded its "sphere of influence": to ship docks, travel agencies, airline ticket purchase places, and various streets and corners; wherever they thought there was an opportunity to profit, there were traces of the "party." After the victory, the "legacy" did not disappear. After all, Shanghainese are Shanghainese. In order to admire the thighs of American movies, they could "unsparingly" spend ten thousand yuan on a ticket. The generosity of the gentlemen fueled the development of the scalper party. At the same time, the ticket sellers in the theaters and the ×× who were responsible for suppression further supported the scalpers' misdeeds.</p>
<p>Our authorities naturally cannot ignore this "enemy-puppet legacy." Seeing the recent news reports of "catching scalpers," we earnestly hope that the authorities will make a "thorough elimination" of these "scalpers" and severely investigate and punish those ×× and ticket sellers who collude with the "scalper party"!</p>

<p>— Zhong Yu</p>
<p>Puyi, the last emperor of the Qing Dynasty, was once regarded by the braid-wearing warlord Zhang Xun as the object of restoration in 1917. After the September 18th Incident, he was spotted by Doihara and made a puppet emperor for fourteen years. Unexpectedly, now he has won the favor of "friendly countries" and is being carefully looked after. This Puyi seems to be a real "rare commodity"; but I don't know what tricks they plan to play after hoarding this "rare commodity"?</p>
<h3 id="e174">The Ballpoint Pen That Invalidates Checks <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Zixun</p>
<p>Even after a ballpoint pen was used to sign a check that was declared invalid, its value did not decrease. It still provides great help to aviators, swimmers, travelers, and busy people. The general public must be eager to know its structure!</p>
<p>Several years ago, an American scientist announced that he had invented a new type of pen tip that could replace the commonly used pen tips. Its performance was relatively superior, saving ink, not catching on the paper, and with many other advantages. However, it was not adopted until last year. As a result, its advantages were indeed greater than its disadvantages, and its success was unimaginable.</p>
<p>The secret of the ballpoint pen lies entirely in a pen tip. If the reader pays attention, they will definitely find that it is a very small steel ball. This steel ball rotates in a small socket at the tip of the pen. When writing, it rotates and relies on the adhesion of its molecules to absorb a very small amount of ink and distribute it into a thin layer, leaving it on the paper, forming the words you write.</p>
<p>Because it consumes a very small amount of ink and the pen tube has a large capacity, one filling of ink can draw a straight line of twenty-one miles long. On average, with ordinary writing, it can be used for more than two years. After the ink is used up, it can be refilled, just like an ordinary fountain pen. Therefore, the saying that it becomes useless after the ink is used up is inaccurate.</p>
<p>Its pen tube is just an empty tube with a tip to let the ink flow down onto the steel ball. Some are also made movable and replaceable.</p>
<p>At the upper end of the entire pen, there is a small hole that connects to the place where the ink is stored. When the ink cannot be written out, you can blow air into the small hole with your mouth, and it can also balance the pressure on both sides and prevent leakage.</p>
<p>It does not use ordinary ink, but a specially made oily ink, a paste-like substance, with fast-drying properties, drying as it is written.</p>
<p>Its special features are not limited to this, and it can write on clothing. More amazingly, it can write in water, which no other pen can do.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Above the Graves <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Qian</p>
<p>Some time ago, Wang Bingnan, a spokesman for the Chinese Communist Party, announced that the CCP army would abandon all strongholds and adopt large-scale guerrilla tactics throughout the country. This news is not terrible. But later, according to a United Press dispatch, the Yan'an Radio issued a warning by broadcasting: "What the National Army will find in northern Jiangsu is not paradise, but graves." The radio station also explained why northern Jiangsu would become a grave, saying: "The CCP army in the area has been focusing on guerrilla warfare." The meaning is clear and certain, which cannot help but make the people of northern Jiangsu and even the entire Chinese people feel a sense of humor.</p>
<p>Once northern Jiangsu has the CCP army's guerrilla warfare, it will become a grave. Then, within the scope of the whole country, with the CCP army's guerrilla warfare, it will not be difficult to turn the whole of China into a large grave. This kind of "loyal ambition" of the CCP for the country and the people is certainly worthy of the "applause" of the whole Chinese people. But if the CCP's ambition is really realized, what will the whole of China become like? The answer is:</p>
<p>Below the graves are the people, above the graves is democracy, and democracy stands on the graves, singing loudly "Wildfires cannot burn it out, the spring breeze blows it back to life"!</p>

<h3 id="e177">About the Atomic Bomb, Can You Answer These Questions? Test Yourself. <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The following ten questions are all about the "atomic bomb," which is of global interest and concerns the peace and war of the world. Anyone who regularly pays attention to the newspaper and has a high school student's knowledge of natural science will not find it difficult to answer each question. If you answer each question correctly, give yourself ten points. If you get eighty points or more, your score is excellent; sixty points is average; and less than forty points means your scientific knowledge seems to be lacking. Among the three options A, B, and C under each question, one must be correct.</p>
<p>(1) The principle of atomic energy used in the atomic bomb was published:</p>
<p>A Before World War I;</p>
<p>B Between World War I and World War II;</p>
<p>C One year before the first atomic bombing of Japan.</p>
<p>(2) Einstein is:</p>
<p>A The inventor and main designer of the atomic bomb;</p>
<p>B The originator of the atomic bomb principle;</p>
<p>C The advocate that the secret of the atomic bomb should be kept forever by a strong country.</p>
<p>(3) The main raw materials for the atomic bomb are:</p>
<p>A Organic high explosives;</p>
<p>B Historically unprecedented poisons;</p>
<p>C Radioactive elements.</p>
<p>(4) The successful research of the atomic bomb proved that:</p>
<p>A "Matter" cannot be transformed into "energy";</p>
<p>B "Energy" cannot be transformed into "matter";</p>
<p>C "Matter" can be transformed into "energy".</p>
<p>(5) The explosion of the atomic bomb is mainly due to:</p>
<p>A Splitting of the atoms of radioactive substances;</p>
<p>B Hydrolysis;</p>
<p>C Thermal decomposition.</p>
<p>(6) The atomic bomb must contain:</p>
<p>A The radioactive element "radium";</p>
<p>B Uranium or Plutonium;</p>
<p>C TNT and DDT.</p>
<p>(7) From the beginning of the atomic bomb research to its completion, the late President Roosevelt:</p>
<p>A Never participated in it;</p>
<p>B Personally approved the research plan;</p>
<p>C Constantly informed the other three major leaders of the research results.</p>
<p>(8) Japan asked the Allies to surrender:</p>
<p>A The day after the first atomic bomb was dropped on Japan;</p>
<p>B Before the first atomic bomb was dropped on Japan;</p>
<p>C On the day the first atomic bomb was dropped on Japan.</p>
<p>(9) The locations where the atomic bomb was dropped on Japan were:</p>
<p>A Hiroshima and Nagasaki;</p>
<p>B Tokyo and Yokohama;</p>
<p>C Kobe and Osaka.</p>
<p>(10) Some people believe that China may also use "atomic energy" in the future, because within the country:</p>
<p>A There are already factories extracting the radioactive element "lutetium";</p>
<p>B Scientific research institutions are manufacturing large quantities of "heavy water";</p>
<p>C Uranium ore deposits have already been discovered.</p>
<p>(Li Chi)</p>
<p>Answers will be revealed tomorrow.</p>
