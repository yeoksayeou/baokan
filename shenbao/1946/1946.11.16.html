<h3>憲政初階於焉肇始　國民大會開幕禮成　出席代表共一三五五人</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕中華民國開國以來之首屆國民大會，於三十五年十一月十五日晨正式揭幕。首都全市國旗招展，陽光普照，盡沐於和樂欣愉之氛圍中。九時起國府路大道上即車水馬龍，熟鬧空前，國民代表及政府首長，友邦使節相繼蒞臨。大會堂內外，相互寒喧，笑語歡聲，大會職員及記者羣均忙碌萬分。各代表步入會堂大門後，即將代表簽到卡片之第一百撕下繳於簽到處，由聯絡組職員招待入樓下會塲自由入座，政府長官及來賓于右任·蔣夢麟·孔祥熙夫婦等三十餘人，被陸續延登樓廳：坐於右手前排，外交使節團於巴西大使遊蘭略率領下，由外交部禮賓司長李駿陪至樓廳左手前排落座。</p>
<p>大會之布置，荘嚴瑰麗，自國府路上兩端牌樓至會堂門首，會場內外，處處金碧輝煌，絢爛耀目，會堂牌樓項上及大門對面照壁上之國旗，亦皆於今晨升起，迎風招展。會場內藍白紅三色錦綵及圖案，至爲悅目。會堂大門楣上橫飾「天下爲公」朱色四大字，會塲大門兩邊則爲「以建民國」。「以進大同」大字聯語，主席台上之陳設尤爲堂皇，臺　爲下　流蘇之紫紅色絲絨幕，臺身三面牆壁均以白網裱飾，後壁正中，懸巨幅國父遺像，上綴金質國花，下繫銀質嘉禾，左右國旗垂展。合中後部排高背座椅一列，前置長案，上供紫色大花瓶，滿盛菊花。案前左右各擺座椅一張，再前正中爲主席台，舖紫紅絨毯，上置麥克風，兩側設紀錄席，台口正中爲一階梯，梯口爲鐵樹兩株，前置發言台，兩邊合沿上下密陳茜草及藍白紅三色菊花，兩角各立小雪松一株，大國旗一面，於水銀燈之強光照臨下，璀璨華貴，允歎觀止。</p>
<p>吳敬恒領導宣誓　代表已足法定額</p>
<p>九時五十分，大會臨時主席吳敬恒老先生衣長袍馬褂大禮服到來，當由洪蘭友氏親迎下車，並於會堂門首留影爲念。十時整，蔣主席衣戎裝，倔靑天白日勛軍，偕夫人及秘書會聖芬。周策蹤等蒞止，逕入食堂後面之休息室小憩。旋蔣夫人亦步入會場，親自簽到，並代主席簽到後，就座於右側第一排。</p>
<p>十時十五分，蔣主席及吳敬恒，洪閘友諸氏，自左側便門步入席臺，首由洪氏宣讀國大　委會報告二事：（一）國大代表名額法定共二〇五〇人，經國府明令公布者一五八〇人，已報到者一四二〇人，出席者一三五五人，已足法定人數。（二）國大預備會議曾推舉蔣主席爲開幕式臨時主席，但蔣主席　遜堅辭，並論由代表中年事最高者担任，故改請吳（敬恒）先生擔任，吳氏乃於鼓掌中就主席位，於音樂聲中宣告開會。行禮如儀後，全體代表舉右手宣誓，旋由吳氏致開會辭（風另條）</p>
<p>吳氏致詞畢，即請國民政府蔣主席致詞，時爲十時三十五分，主席首稱：「此次國民大會是中華民國劃時代之盛舉，中正適仟國府主席，至感光榮，故特來致賀。」後即宣讓演辭全文（見另條），十時五十五分辭畢，全體代表肅立向主席致敬，至五十八分於音樂悠揚中蔣主席及吳稚老相偕退席，開幕式宣吿禮成，中國之憲政時期，乃於以肇始。</p>
<h3>吳敬恒氏開會詞　盼以讓協商制成憲法</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十五日電〕十五日晨國大開幕禮主席吳敬恒致開會詞，全文如下：</p>
<p>國民政府主席，各位代表先生，今天是我中華民國人民最愉快的一天，因爲開一個劃時代的大會，這個劃時代的大會，就是中華民國第一次國民代表大會。這個第一次國民代表大會，是國父創建了民國早定在建國大綱上的，是一個完成絕對民主還政於民的大會。這個會，近年國內各黨各派皆會督促幫助，現在開成了，足以安慰他們的民主熱望，尤其全國民衆對建國大綱的還政盼望已久，國父早早囑咐他的黨人，必須由國民黨担着這個義務，籌備了創開起來，所以國民黨兢兢業業，一直議開這個大會。自廿五年起，實現其召開之手續，曾愼重的選舉區域代表，屢次定着相宜日期，無如抗戰等等，每爲現狀所阻格，今天這個大曾居然實現，聚集在一堂開幕，國父在天之靈，必十分愉快，這是第一點，深可慶幸的。</p>
<p>國父囑咐國民黨訓政，訓政的工作本極艱巨，而且今年是民國卅五年，民國十六年以前那十五年，不但說不上什麽訓政，國民黨流離播遷，國父把他的黨都要從新改組。十六年至廿五年那十年中，開始的四五年，即遭逢江西·湖北的內戰，連以後抗戰的力量，都在那幾年喪失，一到二十年九一八的外患接踵而來，二十六年至今，更入抗戰時期，無其實而有其名的訓政，還能容許進行麼？所以二十五年國民黨就渴想國民大會開成，還了這個訓政空名，而且依着國父訓政，是要學伊尹訓太甲，周公訓成王，談何容易，惟一做他黨人的義務，要使全國一致瞭解他創建的中華，中華民國非三民主義不可，一直議立憲草，及至最近協商，全國人民與各黨各派的認中華民國是三民主義共和國，那末，最重要的目的，賴着全國民衆及各黨各派共同訓好了，還担着這個虛名做什麼？吾失了黨譽還是小，遺誤國家就大了，還不是早還政，國民黨份子到底健全的很多，不使他們追隨各黨各派在憲政時代一路協商，協商共爲民衆服務，還不開這大會，還祖負虛名做什麽呢？今天大會居然開幕，這是第二點心安理得的幸樂。</p>
<p>大會開成，得到一個最前進的憲法，爲人民後盾，則現在共同蘄求的和平安樂，是可以圓滿達到的，可是孔子說能以禮讓爲國乎何有，不但爲國須要禮讓，而保持全世界的安寗亦全賴忍讓，過去野心家出來擾亂，幸　蘇聯的史達林先生首倡忍讓，解放第三國際，制止托洛斯　派的盲動亂源，跟着美國的羅斯福總統，亦以最大的忍讓，忠吿希特勒，他說「你說我們民主政治是落伍，我們却不認落伍，但是我們行我們的民主政治，你行使你的納粹主義好了。」希特勒不聽，而因此美國務卿亦忠吿他人說，世界是大得很的，容納不同的主義，是容得了的。杜魯門總統亦說，世界的不安，就是因爲政治哲學各有異同，我想世界不但甚大，而且甚長，政治哲學每每太高深，高深的學者看了無所謂，十一般民衆便驚異得要不肯忍讓起來，便弄成世界不安，和平失望了。所以今後我們皆用忍讓，協商不已，便會在我們憲政時代得到繁榮了，所有各黨各派皆能本着協商精神來會，先後幫助制成最前進的憲法，道是第三點，希望忍讓能發揮力量，願以此三點貢獻各位參考。</p>
<h3>陸海空軍將領　招待國大代表</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕白崇禧·陳誠·顧祝同。周至柔·桂永淸·黃鎭球·能雲·湯恩伯等八將領，十五日下午四時在國防部禮堂舉行鷄尾酒會，招待國大代表，到中樞首長及代表千餘人。又谷正綱定十六日下午三時在勵志社茶會，招待出席國大職業代表，被邀請者三百餘人。</p>
<h3>國大預備會議　後日上午舉行</h3>
<p>將推定主席團並討論議程</p>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕國大十五日報到代表有葛敬恩，胡子昂等五人。又國大十六日上午原定舉行預備會，頃改期至十八日上午九時舉行。各代表十六晨將赴　谷寺陣亡將士塔獻花。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十五日電〕國大定十八日舉行預備會議，會中將推定大會主席團及大會秘書處人選，並討論大會議程，國民大會秘書處正式成立之期，當在秘書處主持人選推定之後，屆時國大籌備委員會之任務方結束，一切工作始可移交大會秘書處辦理。</p>
<h3>主席最勉代表　完成制憲任務　藉以奠定民主法治始基</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十五日電〕蔣主席今（十五）日在國民大會開幕禮中致詞全文如下：</p>
<p>各位代表諸君：</p>
<p>今天國民大會舉行開幕典禮，各位代表受人民付託之重，齊集首都，參加制定中華民國憲法的大業，這是我們中國進入民主憲政時期的開端，也是我們中華民國建國史上最莊嚴最盛大的集會。中正僅代表國民政府，向各位敬致歡迎的熱忱，並向大會表示誠摯的敬意。</p>
<p>秉承國父遺志　完成建國目標</p>
<p>回溯國父倡導國民革命，畢生奮鬥的目的，在於復興中華，建立民國實行三民主義，使中國爲民有民治民享富強康樂的國家。辛亥革命，摧毀了四千餘年的君主政體，推翻了二百餘年的滿淸專制，國父嘗論此役之意義，謂「自經此役中國民主政治已爲國人所公認」，但是民國成立以後，基礎未固，主義未行，軍閥竊國，擾攘　已，外侮紛乘，國將不國，我們國父又率勵同志繼續奮鬥，冒險犯難，再接再厲，其堅決的意志，明吿我全國國民的，一則日「中國宜於民主」，再則曰「不務民國之名而務主權在民之實」，國父民權主義的精義，在使一人民有權」，亦就是要全體人民能够管理衆人之事的政治，建國大綱的訂立，明定了革命方略的步驟，由軍政訓政而入於憲政時期，就是要使民治有鞏固的基礎，民國有堅強的保障，國民政府秉承國父遣志，所以在民國十七年北伐完成以後，就積極開始訓政，而以實行憲政完成建國爲最大目標。</p>
<p>關於實施憲政及召開國民大會的籌備，其詳細經過，主管機關富另有報告。國民政府自二十五年五月公布了憲法草案，接着頒布國民大會組織法與選舉法，全國各地就開始進行國民大會代表的選舉，抗戰以前政府原已決定於廿六年十一月十二日召開國民大會制頒憲法，那時各地代表的選舉已將完成，而日本加緊侵略發動七七戰事，政府爲捍衛民族生存，號召全國從事於神聖的抗戰，此後軍事緊張，國民大會的召集，事實上陷於困難，然而二十八年的六中全會，仍決議於廿九年十一月召開，終以戰事擴大，參政會許多同人均主張緩開，乃又因而延期，及至三十二年十一中全會，以國大會期不可不有一明確的規定，乃決議「於戰爭結束後一年內，召開國民大會」，但是中芷個人認爲，抗戰建國應畢其功於一役國民大會能及早召開，則中國根本大法得早日制定，國民政府就可以提早實現還政於民的宿願，所以在三十四年第六次全國代表大會中提議，於同年十一月十二日國父八十生辰紀念舉行國民大會，當經大會通過，幷積極展開籌備的工作。當時的意思，就是覺得實行三民主義的憲政，是國父畢生盡瘁的一個最大的志願，民國元年國父的功成不居，以及後來始終一致的奮鬥，都是爲了國家人民的福利與自由，因此我們全國同胞要紀念國父，也惟有以召開國民大會制頒憲法來紀念我們革命建國的導師。今天我們國民大會的開會，已照預定的期間後了一年，各位代表在開國偉人的遺像之前，懷念我國民主政治艱難奮鬥的歷程，定必有無窮的景慕追思之感。</p>
<p>政府寬容和協　信守政協決議</p>
<p>自從去年日本投降以後，妨碍我國統一和民主的外患是根本消除了，但是國內形勢却存在着很大的困難，武裝黨派的行動，影響了國家和平與安定，而政治意見的異同，也足以分散戰後建國的力量。國民政府深切感覺，國家經八年抗戰非常的破壞之後，必須立即進行非常的建設，而國家建設要須利進行，必須有舉國一致精誠團結的努力，因之，在今年一月召集政治協商會議，集合各黨派代表社會賢達於一堂，共商和平建國的犬計，二十天的會議，產生了關於政治軍事的五項協議，其有關國民大會者，爲五五憲單修正原則的提出國民大會代表名額的擴大，並確定本年五月五日爲召集國民大會的日期，在這些協議之中，國民政府一貫以爲國爲民的精神，體念戰後同胞的不堪痛苦，建國大計的不可稽延，始終採取寬容和協的態度，同意於各項協議的成立，而在政協會議閉幕以後，則忠實信守政協的決議，次第實施，國民大會組織法亦依據協議予以修正，其間又經過了不少的曲折，致五月五日未能如期召開，而我們全國所盼望的國民大會，到了今日，始能舉行，對於各位代表，尤其是遠通來京滯留多日的各位代表，是不能不報吿經過的。</p>
<p>兼顧理想現實爲國長治久安</p>
<p>今天到會的各位代表，分別來自各省市各地方，更有自海外遠道回到祖國來參加的，各位成則代表區域，或則代表職業，對政治有豐富的經騐，在社會上有卓越的聲望，產生的性質不同，而熱烈期望我們國家的實現民主團結與進步，則是人同此心，毫無二致的，尤其是來自曾經淪陷十四年的東北，來自新近光復的臺灣，其愛慕祖國，願爲國家貢獻效力的精神，一定是特別殷切。我相信各位必能深深說念國父所說的「國家之本在於人民」和「億兆人民緊於國家」的兩名名言，洞明國家與人民的關係和人民對國家的責任，依法執行各位的制憲任務，爲中國憲政開啓一個良好的發端。我們知道憲法是國家的根本大法，不是普通的法規所可比擬，憲法是全國共循的法典，一方面必須有遠大的理想，一方面又必須顧及國家現實的情况，我們的理想就是國父遺留的三民主義和五權憲法，我們國家的現實，就是國家社會自抗戰以來，經過長期間的演變和進步，惟有理想與現實兼顧的憲法，纔是適合國情而完善可行的憲法，纔能爲國家策長治久安，爲同胞謀眞正幸福，如果我們能專心一志，制定一部完善可行的憲法，奠立民主法治的始基，則全國各地方各階級各職業的民意，以及各政黨的意見，皆可循法定的軌轍而表達。</p>
<p>歸政全國人民　以立百年根基</p>
<p>今後一切問題，都可以依法訴諸全民的公意，以爲取決，而後我們國家，纔有眞正獨立自由統一民主的基礎，而後我們同胞纔能行使眞正的民權，確盡國民的義務，以促進國家的繁榮與進步。</p>
<p>中正追隨國父，致力革命，始終以建設中國爲獨立自由統一民主的國家爲我平生的志事，過去八年的抗戰，主旨在排除強暴侵略求得中國的獨立自由，賴我全國同胞與全體將士的努力，終於獲得最後勝利，而且在抗戰中間實現了國父廢除不平等的遺訓，與英美蘇聯等聯合國締結平等友好的新的，但是追溯生平，終覺得我們從九一八國難以來，到今天還沒有頒布憲法，實行憲政，是一件最大的遺憾。我對於結束訓政，實施憲政，以完成建國大業的希望，在此三十年之間，是沒有一時一刻忘懷的。我們革命建國的奮鬥，是爲國爲民，是要實行三民主義和五權憲法的民主政治，這是我們革命的最後目標，這一個最後目標一天不能達成，就是我們國父的遣志一天沒有達到，亦就是我們對國家對人民對五十年來的革命先烈一天沒有盡到實任。我要特別掬誠以吿各位的，中國國民黨自民國二十年受國民會議的委託，以行使政權，國民政府根據訓政時期的的法，以行便治權，在這十餘年中間，沒有一天不競競業業，如重負之在身，現在抗戰勝利，幸能無負國民的付託，所惟一期望的”就是要及早制頒憲法，實施憲政，歸政於全國人民，以立民國百年不拔的根基，而這個神聖莊嚴的制憲任務，就要我們代表諸君共同負荷。</p>
<p>各位代表諸君，我們這次國民大會，可以說是經過無數艱難，歷盡千回百折，而始能開成，我們追念國父領導革命的艱辛，及革命先烈前仆後繼的奮鬥，我們各位代表，必求道一次大會無負於國父與革命先烈的遺志，我們回想過去，受盡敵人侵略的阻撓，而稽遲了我們建國的大業，我們各位代表，又必當竭智盡忠，完成這一神聖的任務，以求安慰我八年抗戰爲國犧牲的軍民之靈。同時我們想到今日政治的不安，人民的痛苦，都由國家基本的未立，而此次制定憲法，乃爲安定國家根本的要圖，實現憲政之治的發軔，我們各位代表的使命更是何等荘嚴而重大。中正今日參加盛會，引爲無上榮幸。謹以至誠，禱祝各位代表爲國努力，並祝大會成功。（完）</p>

<p>會堂裏，主席台左右分列着三行盛開的藍的白的紅的菊花。洪秘書長藍袍玄掛，往來指揮。九點半左右，代表們已經陸續入塲了。各國使節，來賓，和政府各首長的席次是在樓上的，最引人注目的當然是銀　飄拂的于院長。開幕式才開始的時候，司徒大使的頭低垂着，如有所思。</p>
<p>稚老笑容可掬</p>
<p>吳稚老到得也早，今天，他眞像是什麼人結婚典禮中的證婚人，似乎比在上海時更發福了。藍緞棉袍，玄綢馬掛，進塲時笑容可掬，運連與熟人招呼寒暄。</p>
<p>十時十分，主席在熱烈掌聲中走上主席台。今日主席穿黃色戒服，戴白色手套，步履矯捷，莊嚴而沉毅。</p>
<p>開幕式正式開始之前，先在爲籌備國大化費了不知多少心血的洪秘書長報告，國大代表名額二千另五十人，政府明令公布者一千五百八十人，至十五日上午十時止，報到者一千四百二十人，今日到會者一千三百五十五人。前次各代表在談話會上會表示不請國府主席爲大會主席，但是主席請辭，遂推代表中年事最高者爲大會主席，而吳代表敬恒是年事最高的一位。說到稚老的大名時，各代表黨　雷動。於是稚老就主席位，開幕典禮正式開始。</p>
<p>宣誓姿態不一</p>
<p>稚老領導各代表宣幫時，各代我齊舉右手，有不少是握拳的，姿態有剛有柔，極爲美妙可觀。讚誓詞時，有說國語的，有說廣東話的，有說福建話的，會塲中像有一陣潮水衝向山石，各代表的表情都是很虔敬的。</p>
<p>稚老致詞之後，就請蔣主席致詞，全塲屛息靜聽。此時攝影記者最忙了，有一位美國攝影記者一連攝了十幾張之多。稚老致詞時有一位攝影記者的燈泡炸了，全塲瞿然。</p>
<p>會塲兩側水銀燈不少，中電正在爲這偉大的一幕攝製電影，不久，全國的同胞就都可以看見這盛典是如何莊嚴了。</p>
<p>全體起立致敬</p>
<p>主席致辭完畢後，全體代表提出臨時動議向勞苦功高的蔣主席起立致敬，一下十全體代表就肅立起來，蔣主席也起立答禮了。就在這時候，典禮在音樂聲中完成，各代表也紛紛退席，走到外面，把簽名蓋章的宣誓　送給了塲外兩個櫃子裏的女職員。有許多代表擠在臨時郵局前面，買紀念郵票。孫院長在樓梯上和邵秘書長立談片刻，似有所待，但是一轉眼又離開了。</p>
<p>記者包圍稚老</p>
<p>會堂門口，吳稚老爲有些記者們包圍了要求簽名，簡直寸步難移，一直到警衛組的人員來了才解開。無綫電廣音器在指導代表們，如何乘坐各路專門接送代表的國大交通車。此外，貼着五角星和長紙條出入證的各代表的轎車，吉普車，也就紛紛離開。大會堂又淸靜了。</p>
<p>今天的開幕式，是十時十五分開始的，十點五十分禮成。我曾問許多位代表，「什麽時候開預備會？」他們的回答幾乎不約而同的說，「我們等着看報上的消息，還是要你們吿訴我們。」</p>

<h3>毅然提出代表名單　青年黨參加國大　左舜生氏發表局面談話</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕青年黨參加國大名單巳於十五日提出，下午八時國大繼遴選代表委會，在國府禮堂開會，到吳豐昌，陳立夫，張厲生，于右任，賈景德，由吳敬恒主持，討論通過青年黨名單，今晚公布。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十五日電〕青年黨毅然參加國大，名單亦巳提出。記者特走動該黨宣傳部長左舜生氏，探詢該黨決定參加之經過及理由，承左氏發表局面談話如下：「自上月廿一日第三方面人士承政府邀約，聯袂來京，經過廿餘日奔走商談，期間不少可歌可泣之事實，對問題撤結之所在，雖巳大體明瞭，但政府與中共之間，仍有若干意見，無法接近，即第三方面之本身所見亦不無出入，延至本月十一日夜間八時，即國大原定開幕之前夕，仍無法獲利一致之協議；本黨及若干社會賢達，始決定表示可以提名單，但仍希望政府將開會日期延遲數日，以作最後之努力，此即國大開幕日期延綏三日之由來。不幸在此最後之三天，民盟既作暫不參加之決議，中共則力主停開，吾人爲促成民主憲政之實施，並與若干社會賢達表示一致之行動，更不願引起全國日陷水深火熱之人民發生過度失望之感，始將本黨代表名單毅然提出。溯自數年以來，吾人對全國團結之工作，亦爲奔走調停，不遺餘力，其所懷抱之目的，一爲爭取和平，二爲促成統一，三爲實現民主，此不僅爲朝野各方絕無異辭，即全國人民亦莫不對此殷殷期待。所不同者，有人認爲參加國大足以破壞和平，吾人則認停職既巳實行，惟一致參加國大，和平始有繼續維持之希望；有人認參加國大足以召致分裂，吾人則認分裂本爲數年來巳成之事實，惟有一致參加國大，始有促進全國統一之可能；有人認參加國大足以妨碍民主，吾人則認惟有將政協改訂之憲草，在本屆國大通過，鋒利舉國一致之支持，民主始能獲利一有力之保障。凡此若干主要目的之完成，實爲本黨創黨以來基本立塲之所在。至國大如今日期之如何決定，國府及行政院改組於國大開幕以前或稍遲數日，確亦與政協決議有關，然比較前所列舉之大者遠者，則尚屬將要。敢以此意昭告國人，功罪是非，見仁見智，一切惟有聽諸當代賢豪及後世史家之公斷。」</p>

<h3>社論　對國大代表的期望</h3>
<p>—讀　蔣主席演詞後</p>
<p>舉世矚目全國期待的國民大會，不知經過多少次的波折，終於在昨晨揭幕了。這是中華民國歷史上最重要的一天，也就是我國政治從政步入憲政的開端。凡是渴望和平蔪求民主的人民，對於這次國民大會的開幕，無不表示歡欣與慶幸；抱着滿腔的熱望；人人都希望這次國民大會能制定一部切實可行的民主憲法，替國家百年大計奠定一個鞏固的基礎。我們聽了　蔣計謀在國大開幕典禮上所發表的演說，益信國大責任的重大，並相信其必能獲得圓滿結果，但是在這具有歷史性的國大開幕典禮內，我們老百姓並沒有看見中共參加在內，這不能不令人失望，而引爲遺憾。</p>
<p>在目前的中國，迫切需要的是和平，是民主，是統一；但是如何獲致和平統一民主？其唯一的途逕，就是走上憲政的正軌。所以召開國大制定憲法，實在是全國人民日夜渴望的，也是目前政治上刻不容緩之舉。除了別有居心以外，絕無反對的理由。中共的拒不參加國大，並作進一步的表示，企圖使國家陷於分裂的境地，徒見其心勞日拙而巳，決不會獲得人民的同情，對於國大的召開以及完成其神聖的制憲任務，初無絲毫影響。至於民主同盟甘心附和中共的主張，不僅有失其原來的立塲。而且必遭人民的唾棄，所幸政府這次召開國大，一本其忍讓的精神，對於中共，對於民盟，無不以赤誠待之，國大更番的延期，就是政府始終希望他們參加國大的表示，甚至到了國大開幕之後，仍保留其代表席次，隨時可以報到參加。所以我們至今猶希望民盟能以國家爲重，幡然覺悟，早日參加國大，以完成制憲的偉業。</p>
<p>這次國民大會是中華民國的第一次國民大會，相當於法國的國民制憲會議，也就是美國獨立後所召開的美國制憲會議，其唯一的任務，厥在制定一部切實可行的民主憲法。翻閱各國的制憲歷史，再追溯我國制憲的經過，就不難知道，制憲工作，實在是一件艱難的事情，憲法本身的好壞，對於國家的前途，實有極密切的關係，所謂「壞的憲法比沒有憲法更壞」；同時制憲工作的成敗，又是國家與濾的關健。這次國民大會制定憲法，不但要求民主的實現，而且這一部憲法，關於和平，關乎統一，國民大會代表所負的責任，實在太重大了。蔣主席在國大開幕時致辭，曾剴切告誡全體代表稱：「希望諸代表於締造憲法時，大家咸能衷心合作，並容納各方面之意見，建立一部完善可行的憲法」。</p>
<p>何謂憲法？就是國家的根本大法，有關乎立國的根本。誠如　蔣主席所謂：「憲法是國家根本大法，是全國共循的法典，一方面須有遠大的理想；另一方面，又須顧及國家現實的情況」。而在今日民主時代，人民是國家的主體，對於根本大法的理想以及國家現實情況，當然人人都有所要求，都有所主張。因此對於憲法本質及其精神，形成意見龐雜的情形，並不是意外的現象，而是任何一國所不能避免的。即以美國而論，在一七八七年美國召開制憲會議時，美國人民對於憲法草案，也是意見龐雜，各邦的代表各有其成見，後來幸賴美國政治家的努力，始獲得制憲會議的通過，至今還是美國的根本大法。美國的、統一繁榮、富強，老師靠了這部真實也未能獲得全國人民一致認爲滿意的憲法。但是美國憲法是調和全國的意見而制成的。這一個友邦制憲的史實，足爲我國今日制定憲法實施憲政的示範。</p>
<p>幸而我國人民，咸能信奉　國父的三民主義，就是中共與民盟，也公認願以三民主義爲　國的最高原則，所以全國人民對於凡依照三民主義與五權憲法而起草的憲法，在原則上無有不贊同者，祇多也只有小異，不致像其他國家的人民，對於憲法的起草，漫無標凖。中共的反對國大制憲和民盟的拒不參加，都是別有用心的。這次國大開會討論憲法時，不但有一部由立法院依照　國父遺教所起草後經國府公怖的五五憲草，可以作爲討論的基礎；而且還有政協綜合小組對於憲法草案所提出的幾項修改原則，巳由王寵惠等依照了這幾項修改原則，起草了一部五五憲草修正案草案訂正稿，這是容納各黨各派暨社會賢達的意見起草而成的，也可供比較研究及抉擇。以政治學的理論而言，任何制度，有其利，必有其弊，沒有絕對的標凖，制度的取舍，有待國大代表作賢明的抉擇。姑以中央政制而論，美國式的總統制，與英法式的內閣制，在理論上各有其利害得失，我們究底應該採取那一種制度？就應該高瞻遠矚，正視現實，認爲何種政制最適合我國的國情？何種政制最切實可行？萬該決定採取何種政制。蔣主席對於這一層，也有明白指示：「唯有理想與現實兼顧的憲法，才是適合國情而完善可行的憲法，才能爲國家謀長治久安，爲同胞謀真正幸福」。</p>
<p>要而言之，憲法是國家的根本大法，有關國家將來的興衰及存亡，國民大會負有制憲的任務，代表的責任實在太重大了。所以我們希望國大代表，在討論憲法的時候，必須考慮周詳，虛心體察，尤其應該撇開個人的及團體的成見，而能容忍他人的意見。除了以三民主義爲制憲的根本原則而外，尚須綜彙大家的智慧，調和和方面的意見。務使這一部中國大憲章，成爲真正能代表全國民間的一部憲法。古今中外，有一句共同的格言，即所謂「作事慎於謀始」是也，任何事業的成敗，在其開始的時候早就決定了。這次國大的召開，爲我國走向民主的第一步，不可不特別慎重。所以我們老百姓在國大開幕之後，不得不向國大全體代表，深致期望，希望全體國大代表咸能負起這個神聖莊嚴的任務替國家制定一部切實可行的民主憲法，我國政治走上和平民主之路，開啓一個良好的發端。以促進國家的繁榮與進步。</p>
<h3>特港問題的發展</h3>
<p>自從四外長會議十一月四日在紐約開會以來，就遭遇着兩個最棘手的問題：第一是多瑙河的國際航行，第二是特港的國際共管。據法國據聞社紐約十三日電，四外長會議對於特港問題巳經成立協議三點：　巴黎和會關於特港自由區及其地位的決定當予維持。　四外長會議歡迎意大利與南斯拉夫經由直接談判所可成立的任何協議，但以此項協議不遠反巴黎和會決議爲條件。　四外長會議於本月十三日起，逐點討論法國所擬定的特港計劃。</p>
<p>這三點協議看起來是矛盾的，因爲四外長會議一方面允許義南兩國直接談話，一方面自己又在逐點討論法國所擬定的特港計劃；一方面歡迎義南兩國經由直接談判所可成立的協議，一方面又要他們不違反巴黎和會的決議。但是就實際情形來看，四外長會議既然開會，特港問題不解決，對義和約必拖延，四外長會議當然不能停止會議，靜待沒有把握的義南直接談判。在過去巴黎四外長會議及廿一國巴黎和會中間，特港問題爭執最烈，幾乎使會議陷於停頓，幸賴法國的折衷辦法，纔午後獲得外長會議及巴黎和會的通過。現在的四外長會議，自然不應輕易放棄辛苦得來的巴黎和會決議，重新引起國際的糾紛。</p>
<p>巴黎和會的決議，經過三分之二以上的通過在原則上各國都同意了。現在實施的困難，第一由於義南兩國人民僵持的姿態，第二由於蘇聯和英美勢力的競爭。南斯拉夫以戰勝國的姿態，雖然在特港人口較少，認爲特港應當併入她的版圖。意大利認爲特港本來是自己的土地，不能輕易割讓。雙方不肯妥協，暴動流血，不斷發生。人民的情結非常激昂，兩國政府均不敢輕易讓步。在這樣的情況之下，假如要安定特港，削除暴亂，除掉國際組織強有力的共管政府，一時沒有更良好的辦法。</p>
<p>至於就國際立塲來看，南斯拉夫實際上是的附庸，南斯拉夫在特港多控制一分，蘇聯的勢力就多儘入一分，這是英美所不樂意的。過去四外長會議及巴黎和會關於特港的一切爭執，癓結就在這個地方。法國國際共管的原則雖然獲得通過，然而在實施細則蹭，任何方面而儘有許多獲取控制權力的機會。如像劃界，駐軍，政府組織，選舉方式，都需要蘇聯和英美，南斯拉夫和意大利，互相讓步，纔可以成立協議。</p>
<p>法國新聞社記者認爲特港成立協議，「政治的地平綫因面明朗。」而且說：「僵局的打開，由於蘇聯外長莫洛托夫表示妥協態度所致。」當四外長會議十二日下午開始時，蘇聯建議將特港問題交各外長代表再加研究，但是其他外長反對，蘇聯外長也就立刻同意於十三日開始討論此事。從這些跡象看來，也許可以渡過了。至於另外一個最大的難關，南義兩國的僵持的，因爲雙方都表示願意直接談判，似乎也有好轉的希望。</p>
<p>按義南關係的好轉，蘇聯合社紐約十二日的消息，係　由於南斯拉夫總統狄托與意大利共産黨領袖杜格勞蒂的談話，提供積極的因素，俾在友誼基礎上就相互問題作一般的討論。枉氏曾攜同狄托的提議，主張由意大利保有特港，而以維尼齊亞格里亞省之第二大城格羅齊亞割讓與南斯拉夫，狄托的提議，意大利是否接受，當然還是問題，因爲割讓新的土地，意大利人民必然反對。不過這至少可以證明，南斯拉夫已經不堅持要兼併特港。而且從暴動鬥爭，變爲會議談判，總算一個進步。</p>
<p>特港的問題，無論從蘇聯和英美的關係方面，或者交南關係方面而論，都有了新的發展。現在四外長會議和義南直接談判，同時舉行，雙管齊下，也許更能夠成立各方面都可以通過的解決方案。</p>

<h3>縣政舉步艱難　癥結歸納有五　蘇省二區縣政檢討會　決議治安簡政等方針</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州十五日電〕第二區各縣縣政檢討會議，十五日晨九時在專署揭幕，出席專員兼區保安司令許寳光，副司令夏伯壎，各科長曁八縣長等二十人。行禮如儀後，首由許專員致閒會詞，昭示各縣在淸剿未畢，冬防繼至之秋，及各地嚴重經濟危機潛伏下，應切實確保社會治安，幷傾全力健全鄕鎭　層自治機構。</p>
<p>各縣報告</p>
<p>詞畢，各縣長相繼就民政財政敎育建設保安諸部份，提出詳細報吿，幷痛陳一年以來縣政，處於舉步艱難情况下，癥結所在，實使聽者驚心，歸納而言，可得五點：</p>
<p>（一）財政雖云恢復三級制，而事實上堪稱縣級無財政，舉例言之，田賦由上級提成二分之一，此數幷不按實收而依官額，苟不能徵齊，地方即無收益可言。</p>
<p>（二）縣級人員待遇，較縣屬稽征處待遇猶低，因而對推行庶政之效率，影響極大。</p>
<p>（三）鄕鎭經費無分文撥給，鄕鎭機補形同虛設，一般人員日事民間糾紛之排解，對政令推行漫不經心，庶政無法開展。</p>
<p>（四）過境或駐屯軍隊，視縣府爲副官，應付差遣，疲於奔命。</p>
<p>（五）縣長無人事經濟支配權，處處受牽制，使縣府無法法自治。其他各種細瑣難言之隱，尤屬不勝枚舉。各縣長情緒均極熱烈。</p>
<p>討論提案</p>
<p>大會正午休息，下午二時三十分開始討論提案，茲簡誌其結論如後：</p>
<p>（一）治安問題，爲求防範淸剿及感化之順利，除各縣幹訓所應繼續舉辦外，宜切實加強聯防聯剿，幷由區保安司令部於每縣抽調保安隊一分隊，集中訓練，統一策應指揮，其伙食自帶。</p>
<p>（二）田賦問題，所頒市秤經檢定每祖須少一斤，預計田賦額多各縣須賠損二千担左右，應請補救，幷要求省府合理調整倉耗運耗及遝費。再中央收購各縣賦糧，應參照市價，幷分地分期繳款。</p>
<p>（三）待遇問題，縣級公務人員待遇，呈請有政府調整，至少應與稽征人員保持平衡。</p>
<p>（四）禁烟問題，販吸二罪處罰互有輕重，應呈省糾正，以示公正。</p>
<p>（五）臨時兵役征集，接收頗多過份挑剔，明年正式征兵時，應組織監交機構。</p>
<p>（六）社會經濟日處艱窘，下年度預算應請省府各廳對主管事業儘可能縮小，以使切合實際，幷簡化政令，予民你養生息之機會。</p>
<p>（七）注重鄕鎭造產，以充足鄕鎭經費，傳健全基幹機構。大會至六時許始畢。</p>

<h3>浙西鹽產　將予淘汰</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州十五日電〕兩浙鹽務管理局本銷區原轄江西安徽各七縣，浙江全省及滬一市，其產區爲浙江全省，浙西部份產區原採鹽民與鹽商直接議價，而浙東產區以鹽民及產量較多，恐在淡銷時鹽賤傷及盛民，故均由該局與鹽民議價，再售與鹽商。茲悉明年一月起，兩浙將普遍採用鹽民鹽商直接議價制，該局已在麗水衢縣淳安倉儲大量食鹽，如旺銷時故意高抬鹽價，可即拋出平抑，並聞浙西部份產區以產量過少，影響農作，浪費人力，除自然淘汰外，將強制淘汰。</p>

<h3>爲浦江建橋進一解</h3>
<p>貫通浦江東西之交通建築，有主張築隧道者，有主張建橋樑者，衆意紛紜，至今尙未聞決定。</p>
<p>依筆者愚見，是項工程建橋樑實頗不易，因浦江時有巨輪進出，橋樑非至極高度不可，橋堍須延長至數里。且本埠地面下沉，兼之橋樑之本身過重，橋脚（支柱）有下陷之可龍，（橫跨蘇州河之各橋樑已有此情形）爲此數端，即可見建橋樑實爲不可能。若是築隧道的話，亦因工程浩大，困難重重，兼之經費鉅大，決非市政當局所能負擔，且建築需時，完成無日，故鄙見以建造活動浮橋爲最適宜。至於是項建築可採用立體式，其意見如下：</p>
<p>共下層爲碼頭，闊八十尺，長一百二十尺，若干座連擊而成，並裝有起重設備，旣可作橋樑而又可兼充碼頭，（其中間二座須裝設輪機以備巨輪通過時開啓之用）。</p>
<p>其上層爲行人道，兩旁建造輕便房屋，如水上飯店一般，亦可開設茶室酒吧及各種店舖等。</p>

<h3>希臘北部局勢嚴重　總理與軍事領袖及反對黨緊急會議　前外長宣稱現局可能引起世界衝突</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫數十五日廣播：希聯與南斯拉夫邊境已發生衝突，局勢甚爲嚴重，希臘國防部副部長已飛赴馬其頓前綫。據希臘官方官稱：三日前，希臘距離南斯拉夫邊境六英里處之史克拉鎭遭南軍攻佔，但經希軍反攻後已退回南國邊境，希軍於此役死五十五人。希方將以次事件向聯大會提出申訴。</p>
<p>〔聯合社雅典十四日電〕據薩尼加軍報：希臘邊境史克拉村及南斯拉夫邊界前哨站兩處，兩日前遭遊擊隊約千人襲擊，致有男女及兒童五十名，兵士四十三名羅難。希臘軍事領袖及反對黨領袖，今夜與蔡爾達里斯總理舉行緊急會議，討論北部嚴重局勢。馬其頓省長羅普洛斯亦自薩隆尼加省專機飛此，參加會議。會後宣布：陸長·參謀總長及政府代表，定明日飛往蘇聯尼加，實地視察混亂情形。</p>
<p>〔路透社社倫敦十四日電〕前希臘外長蘇非亞波洛斯單獨接見本社記者謂：希臘之見局，可能引起希臘與其北鄰之衝突，甚至世界之衝突。內戰區自北部之合少里及馬其頓省內，逐漸擴大至南部之史巴達，英國軍隊亦有加入戰團之危險。本人此次赴倫敎，係爲喚醒與論對此等嚴重局勢之注意，並欲請英國在道義上支持希臘聯合政府之組織，蓋組織各黨聯合政府，爲避免極度危局之唯一辦法也。余以爲今日已屆實行伐基蕯協定之成熟期，蓋國人了解內外危機之餘，對內亂已感厭倦，均願成立和解。若英國之政治家能予支持，則必更有助於和解之成立。聯合政府就職後之第一件工作，即爲頒佈大赦，解除兩方平民之武裝，並肅淸政·軍警·及憲兵內之不良份子，然後籌備選民册，舉行新選舉。惟自由選舉可造成國內外對希政府之信任。按蘇氏所述及之伐基薩協定，係於一九四五年二月訂立，原爲結束一九四四年十二月來之內亂者。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十五日電〕今日此問披露：保加利亞政府代表國頃發表文告，否認希臘所傳保國機械化隊及飛機集中希保土三國邊界附近之說，謂此訊實屬「可笑」。</p>
<h3>英工黨議員〔叛案〕　昨晨突有新轉變　外交修正案準提交下議院辯論　美認爲與華萊士事件如同一轍</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十五日電〕工黨議員「反叛」案，今晨突有新轉變。下院議長勃朗聲稱，渠準備將彼等所提之外交政策修正案及徵兵法修正案交付討論。昨夜一般人之觀感，皆料外交政策修正案不致交付討論，故「反叛」運動不久終將屈服，不料今晨議長有此宣布，乃使局勢一變。機本社政治記者稱，此一新發展之用意，在使爲數七十餘之「反叛」工黨議員處入困難地位。議長勃朗稱星期一當繼續辯論英王在議院之政辭，以便討論克羅斯曼等所提之修正案，如有必要，渠準備正式准許辯論此修正案。（議長有權決定何一修正案可交付辦論並表決）觀察家認爲議長之此項宣示，意在使繼續「反叛」之責任，堅定置諸「反叛」議員之肩。彼等在星期一以前，當決定是否將在議院之中，應付政府及其他工黨議員之打擊。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十四日電〕參加「反叛」工黨議員對外交政策之修正案之簽字者，今日又得十三人，總數今已達五十七名，不難超出六十之數。惟自艾德禮首相於昨日發表強力之談話後，原簽字人中意志已有搖動者，彼等對艾德禮首相態度之堅強，表示驚異。故或將不致繼續追究此事。樞密院長莫理遜，亦對此等「反叛」工黨議員提出警吿，吿以若此等「反叛」行動繼續發動，則本年初停止使用之工黨黨律仍有恢復使用之可能。一般相信此次發動「反叛」之領袖，或不免依黨律懲戒。</p>
<h3>美頗爲重視</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十四日電〕此間對英國工黨議員之「反叛」，極爲注意，認爲此乃「反美而親蘇」之行動。有人以此一事件喩美國華萊士與貝爾納斯之爭。美國報紙評論，認爲「反叛」人數不多，雖不足以變更政府之外交政策，然莫斯科則不免因此更懷疑英美立塲之一致。倫敦方面傳稱，若英政府被迫而變更外交政策，財相道爾楨將繼任外相，其就職後之第一件工作，即爲飛莫斯科，覓取英蘇合作之基礎。霍華系報紙記者丹尼謂，「反叛」工黨議員，認爲資本主義而兼帝國主義之美國，業已蠱感艾德禮與貝文使彼等甘心爲金元外交工作。</p>
<h3>南非兼併西南非　美國表反對</h3>

<p>〔路透社紐約成功湖十四日電〕澳洲代表哈斯拉克，今日在政治委會中，首先發言，指責蘇聯濫用否決權，當渠提出關於否決權之決議案時，聲明澳代表團向委會提出之問題，非爲修正第廿七條之否決權規定，而爲諸強國於採用該條時是否履行其所接受之義務。哈斯拉克繼乃將安理會之工作作一檢討，指出蘇聯使用否決權達十次之多，最明顯而惡劣之事，實乃爲一常任理事之得以任意選擇決議案，以使用其吾決權。換言之，即第廿七條所規定之特權，已被推至危險之一點，使安理會之一員不但得干涉理事會之作爲，且得干涉理事會所擬爲之事。哈斯拉克所指摘者，槪括而論計有三點：（一）憲章精神並未被遵從，否決權之使用，超出舊金山會議之原意，並違反強國在舊金山會議巾所作之保障。（二）否決權之使用方式，竟至操縱安理會之工作，破塲外界對該會之信任，减少安理會之效能。（三）常任理事以否決權爲其（國策之一部，已忘却其對憲章應負之責任，不復爲其他會員代表發言。故澳代表團提出下列辦法以資補救，（一）安理會常任理事限制否決權之使用，（二）增加五強間之意見交換，（三）改善安理會制度，使對於程序問題，不必要作不斷之表決。</p>

<h3>中華麻瘋救濟會　徵募運動開幕　當塲拍賣銅豬　徵募目標二億元可望達到</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中華麻瘋救濟會，於昨日下午四時，假座康樂酒家舉行第七屆徵募運動開幕典禮。計到該會名譽總隊長吳市長國楨，名譽副隊長張局長維，暨來賓全紹文、徐振東、谷春帆、徐永祚等百餘人。首由顔福慶代表理事長刁信德（因病遲到）致開幕詞，略謂：全國麻瘋約一百萬人。本市大塲麻瘋療養院，因修理費需款約二億元，迄未修復；現僅收容病人五十八人，亟待募足此數，期能收容一百五十人。又補充設備費約五千萬元，全國各麻瘋院津貼二千萬元，明年會務經費約三千萬元，共需約三億元。國際麻瘋救濟會巳允捐助美金二萬元，行總允贈若幹設備，務懇各界踴躍贊助。繼由吳市長致詞，略謂麻瘋病人常苦麻木，痊瘉需時。最值得大家同情救濟。隔離治愈，更可減少傳染等語。繼由張維致詞，述及麻瘋歷史，近代治療拔術，及中華麻瘋救濟會奮鬥服務熱情。員由總幹事郭志堅報告會務，暨徵求隊組織。繼由徵求隊總隊長齊致，副總隊長王繼陶，外賓李特先後致詞。末由來賓王先生拍賣銅質義豬，計分大中小號三種，百萬噸每只五十萬元，當由陸梅僧、齊致、王繼陶、齊雲青各購一隻，中號二十五萬元，由徐振東、張希齡各購一只，小號十萬元，由何杏園購去一只。</p>
<p>按義豬之由來如此：曩昔有一位熱心救濟麻瘋人士各迦德者，欲救濟麻瘋患者十人，但僅有美金二〇五元，不敷一人之數。其子雖年幼，滿具同情，澈宵未睡。翌晨向其父建議，願買小豬一只飼養，俟其長成。即以所得湊足之。同里兒童知此豬爲救濟麻瘋而飼養，悉贈以優良飼料。不數月，果肥壯異常，售得美金二十五元，即以之捐助於麻瘋救濟。此即爲義豬（Charity　Pig）之小史。</p>
<p>昨日會中，情結熱烈。預測徵募結果，似可超過原定目標。</p>
<h3>美書商談翻印書籍　有違中美商約規定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中美商約簽訂後，其中第九條關於締約國雙方應有版權及文學藝術作品等所有種之任何性質之一切權利及優例之規定，頗引起訪華出版界之關心及憂慮，一般認爲由於此約之簽訂，今後未經許可之翻印及銷售西文書籍將遭禁止，自法律及客觀立塲言自應尊重「版權所有」，惟今後大中學生將失去享受廉價翻印均衡生産書之方便矣。至於翻譯權最近外交部發言人巳有說明稱訂約時另有議定書規定，如中國法律規章對於中國人不給以禁止翻譯之保護時，則對於美國人亦不必給以同樣之保護，而我國「著作權法」則並不禁止翻譯。故商約對於一般書業界及出版界尚不有多大影響。</p>
<p>記者昨並訪中美圖書公司經理龐鐵沫，彼對中國出版界未經許可而翻印西洋書籍極致憤慨，認爲此實無異於盜竊之行爲，並指報上某某書局所登翻印解剖學之广告語記者稱：商約雖巳規定，而翻印依然如故！彼巳將此種情形報告美國出版書局俟商約有效實施後採取相當步驟雲。</p>
<h3>八年艱苦奮鬥　軍醫在進步中　江灣建國防醫藥中心　設備新穎環境優良　可能成全國示範區</h3>
<p>抗戰給我國軍醫業務一次嚴重考驗，也替它開闢了一條走向現代化的途徑。有一位高級軍官對記者客觀地檢討了軍醫在八年艱苦奮鬥中的貢獻，坦白的承認了兩點遺憾：第一是敵人火力太強，使我國的救護工作發生困難，最前線的重傷士兵，有時是無法挽回。第二是救護人員的訓練不夠，有的是知識太低，自覺的責任心不夠強，因此冒險犯難達成任務，有時是不能做到。但是，即使有以上的缺點，我們在八年抗戰之中，軍中沒有發生大規模的傳染性疾病。在一九四二年春季頃北撤退的時候，隨同退卻的人民中，忽然發生急性虎疫，每天有兩千以上的死亡。這種疾病如果在部隊中蔓延，其結果將瓦解國軍的作戰力，但是由於有效防疫工作的展開，軍隊逃過了這重厄運。因此，他說：公平的看法是，軍醫業務在戰時自有它的貢獻。當然弱點是有的，目前需要針對這些弱點，加以改進，使國軍的軍醫業務能走上現代化的大道。</p>
<p>人力物力不夠</p>
<p>在民國廿六年秋季的時候，我國的軍醫業務是不足以應付一塲長期的國際戰爭的。客觀的條件太不具備。以人力而論，國軍全部估計需要三萬名醫師。但是那裏全國的醫師只有一萬名！我們並不能名副其實的征調醫師。等到戰事轉進到後方，隨政府內遷的醫師更少了。軍醫的缺乏，直接影響到戰士的保健和救死扶傷的工夫。同時，病人的診治，百分之四十靠醫生，百分之六十靠護士，但是國軍中有訓練的護士奇缺。以物力而論，一個良好的醫院中，房子，護士，床位，三個條件不可近幾天來缺一。在戰時的我國，這些是談不上，戰士的受苦是加深了。特別是在大會戰的時候，死傷過多，更使有㛚的戰地醫院，爲之應接不暇。在淞滬大戰中，可以一日有三千人送到醫院的。在蘇嘉線上，一師人上雲，有時只有一營人回來！這種慘烈的犧牲，亦使有限的設備，不能同時照顧受傷的勇士。本來這種情形，外國也有，例如在鄧坎克大撤退中，英國的傷兵有一個星期沒有受到治療的。在頃印退軍中，受傷的軍士被遺忘了。不過，這些終是遺憾。</p>
<p>醫官派別各異</p>
<p>在人力物力不足之外，醫官訓練和程度的不同，亦引起許多不必要的困難。抗戰初起之時，部隊不夠現代化，醫官沒有經過統一的訓練。他們的教育程度不同，對於醫學的造詣也大不相同。這樣自然的産生了門戶之見，減低了工作的效率，也千萬了醫藥補給的困難。甲所學的是美國派，他要用美國藥；乙專攻德國醫學，他只會用德國藥；丙也許是一個中醫，西藥他不相信也不懂。但是軍隊不是一家百貨商店，它不能什麽都具備。因此，我們的部隊中藥品特別缺乏。同時，無可諱言的，是我國戰時的徵兵，缺點甚多。士兵的體格和年齡，在入伍之前，並沒有予以嚴密的檢查，等到入營之後，即每每發現新兵有了軍中不應有的疾病，而軍隊中並沒有這種藥品的準備。自然，藥品太少，亦是事實。在廿六工年广州未失之前，我們在香港買進了大批的藥物，甚至遭到香港政府的見怪。但是，事後想來，幸虧有這次交易，否則藥物更是不夠了。</p>
<p>服務不避艱難</p>
<p>以不充分的準備，應付空前的大戰，困難想而知。爲解決人力的不足，當時軍醫署即設短期訓練班，訓練醫官一萬人，分配與各軍服務。這些速成的醫官們，雖然知識與經驗均感不足，但是不避艱難，服務的熱誠是很夠的。在戰時軍醫工作上，我們除了物力不足之外，更吃了交通不便的大虧。譬如在美軍中，他們的醫務設備可以很複雜，很真週到，而我們只能求其簡單而易於搬運。理由是我們的交通工具太少，東西多了就會損害運動性。這些物資條件的不足，只有靠工作人員的熱情來補償。</p>
<p>藥品全賴美國</p>
<p>外來的援助主要是停靠美國。今日公平的批評是美國的確巳盡了最大的努力，但我國所得的實惠卻有限。客觀的理由是如此：首先是「歐洲第一」的原則，指導了整個的戰略和供應，不但是租借法案百分之九十以上的物資到了英國和蘇聯，就是以醫藥品而論，半數以上亦到了歐洲戰塲。次一理由是太平洋逐島戰爭，在盟友的眼光中，是遠東的主要戰塲，很多的醫藥接濟到了那裏。第三是當時中國的供應路線，只有越過「駝峯」的空運，這裏要飛過世界最高的山嶺，而且有零式機截擊的危險。許多美國藥年就犧牲在這個地區。醫藥品從這條空運線上源源不絕的運到昆明，但只是有限供應品中的一小部份。最後是中國戰塲地區太广，國軍人數很多，有限的藥品，一經各戰區分配後，數量就顯得很微小了。不過，即使外援不如我國所期望之大但想到美國是供應全球這個事實時，我們對於不避危難雪中送炭的朋友，還是應當深表感激的。</p>
<p>戰後任務有三</p>
<p>軍醫業務在勝利後，結束了戰時撐持的黯淡歲月，走向光明的現代化途徑。目前一切的計劃和努力，是和整個建軍的大計相配合的。現在的具體任務，第一是爲新軍選擇士兵，使軍隊的體格標進化，並分別其「型式」，用科學的方法，去斷定士兵的性能和他最宜於担當的任務。在美國，這種制度推行巳久，新兵像商品般的彼分門別類，人與事給密切的配合着，我國正開始向這條路走。其次是軍中的保健工作，今後在軍中將嚴格的實行。我們獲得新式武器不難，但需要有體格上精神上伊朗的士兵，去運用這些武器第三個任務是軍醫機構本身的自強工作。一切的醫療衛生工具，將加以調整和現代化。醫藥的補給標凖要軍醫將大批的訓練，以適應新軍的需要；護士的訓練和養成也不忽略。今後在部隊的衛生業務中，要使用大批的專家，不但注重體格，而且兼及心理。必須有這些設施，新的現代化國防軍才能建立。</p>
<p>江灣醫藥中心</p>
<p>部隊衛生業務現代化的努力，在上海區表現出來的，就是在江灣的國防醫藥中心的建立。在這個醫藥中心裏，核心是上海陸軍醫院，外圍是護士學校，軍醫學校，衛生實驗院，衛生勤務訓練所等機構。上海的陸軍醫院在敵僞時期，是敵人的一五七兵站醫院，目前的整理工作尚未完畢，處理顯出日本人住過的痕跡。我問過一位負責的軍官，對於日本軍醫院的批評如何？他的答覆是日本的後站醫院欠整潔，裏面的設備太陳舊。但是應有的盡有。至於日本的軍醫制度，那是相當不錯的。我國全國的陸軍醫院，邇同台灣在內，共有十二個。現在新式的醫療配備源源而來，因客觀條件的優越，江灣區的醫藥中心可能是個示範區。</p>
<p>美國捐贈基金</p>
<p>在衛生實驗院中的軍醫實驗室，至今仍是中美合作的事業。這機構，行政上隸屬於軍醫署，但它是美國醫藥援華會在經濟上的正作巨大協助。它一次撥出二十五萬美金，捐贈實驗室作爲基金，以其中十五萬元添購設備，十萬元作其他用途。在技術的指導上，他們亦居於重要的地位。我參觀了他們的備注血漿靜脈液部，動物試驗室，消毒蒸餾等各部，看見不少新式的設備和的貯藏。深感在朋友願意幫助的環境下，最重要的是本身要努力，不能辜負良機！</p>

<h3>沈嗣良昨日初審　供稱投偽係應付環境保護校產　高檢處起訴書請援情從輕議處　陳立夫顔惠慶有函作證</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前聖約翰大學校長沈嗣良，經國府密令於本年六月二十五日由淞滬警備司令部拘捕移解本市高等法院檢察處，歷四月之偵査，終以漢奸嫌疑提起公訴。起訴書列舉犯罪事實，但稱其附敵投僞，旨在適應環境，維持學校，使莘莘學十母廢母荒，與一般投僞通敵者有別，應請高院援情從輕議處。該案昨日下午在高院初審，詢問歷一小時餘始畢，庭諭案情尙待繼續調査，改期再訊，被吿仍還押。</p>
<p>沈衣灰色西服，黑皮鞋，髮己斑自，神色頽傷，語音低沉，供稱：現年五十一歲，寗波人。住聖約翰大學，在該校服務已三十年，自二十九年一月起任校長，民國二十七年時曾赴重慶，請示當時敎育部長陳立夫，囑回滬繼續維持。起訴書所舉各僞職中，僞大東亞反英美協會委員，僞新國民運動促進會委員，僞上海特別市市民福利協會敎育委員會委員等職，皆未參加，並無其事。至言偽新中國手册所載，係事先並未徵求我同意而將我名字放入，當時亦無從登報聲明。又如僞中日文化協會上海分會常務理事，亦係當時僞市長陳公博將我名字放入，僞市華全國體育協會副理事長係褚民誼所寫，皆未徽求我同意。僞敵產管理委員會，則曾出席兩次會議，係因當時學校校產由日方軍管理，大門上貼有封條，出席會議亦祗知如何接收聖約翰，且該會主任委員係張素民。至任偽上海特別市市政諮詢委員會委員，係自陳公博任僞市長時起担任，但亦祗赴會而已，並未發表意見或提案。因該會爲代表民意機構，故並無薪俸。待周佛海任僞市長，即未參加。任僞體育協會理事長及足球聯合會理事長，係因本人過去在運動方面稍有歷史，乃被推舉。但此係民衆組織，且本人對體育宗旨，祗談業餘技術方面不談政治。足球會專管季賽杯賽，其他不管。故言組織足球隊募款，供給丁默邨特工經費事，或係彼等直接與各球隊接洽，則非余所能管也。民國三十二年二月以聖約翰大學校長名義赴京出席僞第三次全國敎育行政會議，則因日人覬覦校產，奉美國主敎羅培德之命，前往敷衍，但未及閉幕即回，未發表言論亦未提案。任偽上海市保甲委員會長寗區主任委員，係由民衆公推，但因學校事忙，亦僅一月聚會一次，討論地方上事。他如出席僞反英美協會第一次大會時登合演說，及出席歡迎敵重光葵大使汪精衛等歡宴大會，均無此事。日人發起之偽大連市上海市南京市對抗競技委員會聘我任副會長，亦未參加。聖約翰大學聘有坂本義孝，田川大吉兩敎授，係担任經濟及歷課史程，並非担任顧問。亦非來監視學生。祇因當時風聞日方有意派日人到各校担任功課，乃先請此二人加以抵制。此二人爲甚督徒，對彼國內政治亦感不滿。學校之課程皆與戰前無異，無增添日本憲法，日本經濟，明治維新史等事。當時本人爲避免意外，故課外活動除基督徒團契外，其他組織一槪不准。我做校長者，亦有愛國心，一切皆爲不吃眼前虧，否則可因小問題而立刻遭受學校封閉，亦　　許因此受到一部份學生不滿。參加以上僞職，亦爲應付各方面環境，保護學校財產云。</p>
<p>呈上證件並請交保</p>
<p>辯護律師洪士豪宓錫通兩人，向法官呈上陳立夫氏合被吿回滬繼續維持學校之證函，及國際聯青社，聖約翰大學校董會主席顏惠慶等爲被吿作證之文件。證明當時被吿如何維持學校，多根據校董會之意而做。被吿並曾於戰時辦理傷兵醫院，派遺醫科學業生至滇緬公路服務。辯護律師並請庭上於下次開庭時，提詢張素民作證，並請准將被吿交保。庭諭交保事以書面具狀待合議庭評議裁定。</p>

<h3>加強管理百貨商場　警局約法六章　禁止販賣漏稅盜臟物品　棚屋商場一律勒令停業</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市當局前爲整飭市容，便利交通，曾於九月一日起下令取締攤販。各攤販因生計所繫，遂紛紛組織聯合商塲，並均經財政局，社會局之核准開設。各聯合商塲旣非公司組織，又非合夥性質，係由商塲塲主出資租屋，略加裝修後，以數方尺地位分租攤戶，每戶收取櫃費七八十萬元或百萬元不等，（每一商塲容納攤戶約在百戶上，其一次租費收入，在一億元以上）。現經警察局調査結果，此項商塲之開設，雖與市容交通無礙，惟其流弊有三：（一）商塲貪圖重利，設櫃過多，走道狹小，而顧客擁擠，秩序紊亂。（二）建築及設備簡陋，一且發生事故，實不堪設想。（三）漏稅物品或竊盜贓物，難免向此求售。</p>
<p>警局爲防止上項弊端起見，擬具管理辦法如下：（一）函知社會局，財政局，凡此種攤販商塲申請設立，應先經警察局調査許可，方准營業。（二）規定各該商塲櫃攤，走道不得少於五公尺，以免擁擠。（三）各該商場應添設太平門及裝置消防設備，以防事變。（四）塲內須經常保持淸潔，並不得販賣違警漏稅及盜贓物品。（五）凡在棚屋禁建區內，棚屋商塲一律勒令停業，（例如南海商場，建築均係木架布蓬花紙粗泥裝設），（六）請社會局對於櫃戶租金，予以合理限制。</p>
<p>上項議案，已經昨日第五十五次市政會議通過，即將開始實行。</p>

<p>社會局本定今日下午二時召開油價評議會，茲悉已延期至下週一舉行。</p>
<p>雜糧油餅零售商業公會爲自下週一起，每月即將經常配售平價食油三萬六千担，故特自十四日起，辦理全市（包括吳淞江灣等郊區）食油零售商店登記。今已爲登記最後一日，凡未登記之各零售商，均應從速前往登記。又前昨兩日登記總數，已達七百餘家云。</p>
<p>昨日生油市價，與前無甚榮辱，惟趨勢仍屬堅穩，交易散淡。民營廠大有餘大昌新曾配出豆油二百餘担，直接撥交各零售商按議價門售。</p>
<p>民營油廠，　照吳市長上次召開會議中決定，連日將存油向市塲逐日按限價拋售，已將全數售清，至各廠依照目前生產量聯合配銷，按月一萬二千担之舉，則定下週一（十八）家向市銷一千担者，則可申請四千萬元貸款，上海市銀行舉辦五億元食油貸款，其榨油業公會之會員貸款數額分配如次，（一）大有餘，一億六千萬元，（二）大昌新，一億元，（三）大德新，八千萬元，（四）長德，六千五百萬元，（五）順餘，六千萬元，（六）大生，兩千萬元，（七）爲民，一千五百萬元，該公會已按照上列各會員申貸數額，備文送交市銀行核准，至於每廠之保證及抵押品諸手續問題，該公會則擬於下週一上午，由常務理事王時新親謁該行當局接洽云。</p>
<h3>市當局協助證交　抄查證劵黑市　帳冊由監理員檢查　負責人將傳訊具結</h3>
<p>本市經營證券黑市交易之字號，自上海證券交易所開業以來，依然猖獗，並有變本加厲之勢，經營對敲，不　爲變相之賭博，違犯交易所法，擾亂金融，交易所及經紀人營業均受影響，政府對此非常注意，上决宋院長來滬，曾面令吳市長嚴厲取締，昨（十五）日上午十一時許，市府方面即令警察社會兩局，選派幹員，協同財政經濟兩部上海交易所監理員辦公處，及證交方面人員，分頭出動，抄査證券大樓以外經營證券黑市交易之非經紀人字號十餘家，將在塲人員一律問話，塡明記錄，由被問話人簽證，對講電話號碼一律抄下，對方爲誰，均經査明，所有帳册，帶監理員辦公處檢査，即將傅訊負責人，覓保具結，永不再做，聞市府方面以經營證券黑市之字號尙衆，仍將繼續澈査，務期根絕云。</p>
<h3>西商繼續收　公債逐步上漲</h3>
<p>公價昨以西商仍托三三三室來購，且買胃較健，吸收不下四百餘萬元，漲勢被激，統丙一四〇〇元開後曾低至一三六〇元，賣戶吿止，買風漸殷，逐步回升至一六四〇元，始吿回平，結果較前收計甲乙丁谷升一五〇元，統丙漲起二三〇元，統戊好二三〇元，成交不下八百萬元。</p>
<h3>米價續漲</h3>
<p>米市客貨難未减少，登記仍有一萬二千餘石，但以店方消化蟬聯，天氣轉冷，門市零化較股，北粳續漲千餘元，南粳再加一二千元，秈米步升千元，白元陰元高貨均提一二千元至二三千元不一，黃豆因今日東北大豆抵滬一艘，約六七千包，人心見軟，再入疲境，修削千元，麵粉運跌之後，消化略動，回漲二百元，麩皮仍疲，豆餅低百元，小麥到銷兩稀，生仁外埠本街納胃轉懈，下挫三四千元，形成乍升乍降之局，芝蔴貨稀挺秀，盤漲千元，紅糧酒坊進胃不貧，呆平之格，苞米靑島略動，高貨看漲，中關平平，油市未有做開，配汕明日再配。</p>
<h3>中砂白軋現</h3>
<p>昨糖市以中砂白現貨軋缺，回升三二四千元，公會劃盤中砂白初爲十三萬七千五百元，後爲十四萬元，生砂赤由十一萬六七千元升至十一萬九千元，汕頭帮開出新提靑十一萬七千元至五千元，陳黃崗靑十萬〇七八千元，棉赤十一萬五千元。</p>
<h3>人絲配售額　中信嚴格審核</h3>
<p>中信局人造絲，自上月配售以來，已達八次，十四日爲第九次配瞥日期，該局仍按原辦法，照各廠申請數量配出四百九十二箱，本月份電機絲織業申請家數，較上月爲多，數量亦增，請購三千餘箱，經該局審査結果，核定三百卅四家，核准二千三百廿二箱，據該局負責人談：本月份電機絲織業所請雖多，但經核對登記卡，其電機台數與需要數量，均有不符，顯有浮報，當然予以核减，又該局對織帶業，人絲公會所需人造絲決照數配給，惟織帶業七十七家，而所請五百餘箱，據該局調査，認爲數十箱已足，故尙未核定，將提下次委員會解決，人造絲公會各會晨所報者，未列申請數量及運銷地區，該局亦未照配。</p>
<h3>配額不足細紗狂跳　棉布價已與製造成本接近</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗市仍極堅挺，廿支紗續升三五萬，買賣均不踴躍，如特雙馬由二百卅二萬做百二百卅五萬，普通雙馬金城亦成交二百十五六萬，四十二支因所配得之綫，不數應用，各織造廠乃在市塲搜求，價遂一跳廿萬，如藍鳳牌見交三百七十餘萬，尙少供給。</p>
<p>布市運日上漲，已接近製造成本，近日因紗根甚緊，一般紗廠，均願以布易紗，而布廠亦願物物交換，總之，存底稀薄，客銷一動，價即向上高升，稍一呆滯，即往下游，昨日龍頭細布高做八萬七千五百元，其他彩球藍鷄等亦各高漲三四千元外等，惟嗶嘰漲價不多云。</p>
<h3>金價初平後漲　美鈔扳高不已</h3>
<p>烚赤昨十一時半前尙極平定，近午助買消息傳佈，立吿爭買，晨開二四五萬三，開後極爲平穩，求戶雖殷，壓力亦有，高價二四五萬八，即吿回落，逐步退至二四四萬內，始吿平定，央行以二四四萬之價，配給一〇〇條，十時後在平穩狀態中敷衍，始終徘徊於二四五萬左右，別無他變，延至十一時半後，突吿爭買，午刻漲到二四九萬而後稍回，午後隔日交割由平復堅，自二四七萬五左右又哄高至二四九萬，人心極易激動，結果較前收漲四萬二，飾金掛升至念六萬四，紋銀三千六，銀元續升，暗拆銀根平定，息價仍在一角二分左右。</p>
<p>外幣賡績向榮，美鈔暗市的四三八〇元起，逐步盤好，午刻步漲到四五〇〇元以上，午後市塲盛傳政府有改組之訊，新買更湧，最後竟扳高至四七〇〇元以上，較前收續昂半成強。港票自晨初九〇〇元左右步升至九二〇元以上，亦漲三十元。港匯帶高至九一〇元左右，印匯一一〇〇元，英匯一四七〇〇元，美匯仍無變化。成交以港匯爲多，餘皆呆滯。</p>
<h3>助買消息傳來　華股後市轉漲</h3>
<p>華股昨晨更爲悽凉，除銀行界稍做套利交易外，業內外興緻索然，開後人心虛怯，爭斬殘多，立吿下瀉，十時後新華等逢低套利，但遞交方面，經不起來自現交方面之套賣，堅勢難以持久，中途幾成賣戶天下，一再盤跌，統益在跌停板後，始稍轉穩，「遞交」永公首開跌停紀錄，十一時半後，雖有一度補空而回，但附和者少，漲勢亦暫，近午空氣更爲惡劣復在了結之情形下，瀉至低價，結果較前收計熟股永紗美亞信和景福勤興各跌一成左右，新光祗挫半成，冷股榮豐統益火柴公司麗安各跌一成強，餘者均吿微挫，遞交永紗跌百分之入，永公跌一成半，（祗有賣價朱獲成交，是以證交祇有二一七元之價，而無二〇四元之紀錄，。餘者都跌一成左右，午後聞證交在紗布大樓搜捕塲外對敲字號多家，加上國府改組之訊，激起大最買風，對敲大戶補空殷勤，檯面上普遍之買風，因屬隔週交割而更熾，一再爭貿，盤漲不止，除冷落各股外，餘者幾均以高價結束，結果較前收熱股永紗獨升，餘均小挫，信和尙平，冷股新亞尙穩，餘者自微降至跌一成不等，遞交永紗平，美亞信和景福新光微跌，永公午前曾跌停板，尙無成交，午後則並無掛牌，難於統計，塲外各股尙稱平和。</p>
<p>外股因僅前市開做，是以在環境惡劣下，各股有賣少買，無人維持，結果較前收計怡紗英聯微挫，鋼業會德豐跌半成，業廣紙業怡啤航業則各跌一成弱。</p>
<h3>寗夏羊毛　每斤千元　運費須一千八</h3>
<p>〔南京訊〕出席全國商聯會寗夏省代表喬森榮氏云，該雀出產，以羊毛及食鹽爲主，因交通不便，運出困難，目前寗夏省普通羊毛市價爲一，〇〇〇元一斤，如運至天津，上海，每斤運費須增加一千八百元，而最近上海所到之澳洲羊毛，價廉物美，故寗夏省羊毛商以輸滬無利可圖，故均不願將羊毛輸出。</p>

<h3>貨物稅開徵前　定貨存貨免稅</h3>
<p>麥粉水泥等七項新稅開徽後，所有各該貨品，概照出廠時照章完稅，惟査廠商在開徵前接受之訂貨，有開徽後尙未出廠者，應吾繳稅頗有疑問，本市貨物稅局頃奉財政部電示，此項訂貨，准由廠商於貨物稅機關公佈三日內，檢具訂貨合同及合法證件，報請査明，並核對有關賬册，准於本年十一月底前免稅出廠，逾期不得申請或免徵，至在開黴前已行銷市面之存貨，前經規定於本年十月底免稅，就地行銷茲特予展限至十一月止，惟上項定貨及存貨遇到外運及外埠運入者，仍應依照規定徵稅。</p>
<h3>出口貨發票</h3>
<p>請免貼印花稅票　貿協向呼籲</p>
<p>據悉上海直接稅局近面指定經營外匯銀行，請於出口商人申請結匯時，査騐所附發票已吾照章按千分之三實貼印花稅票，未實貼者，須由銀行移送該局法辦，中國進出口貿易協會以目前國內貨價運繳利息繼續增高，出口處境，已極不利，出口發票納貼印花，則成本更高，且出口商向各地採辦貨物時，印花稅已有納貼，今因經營出口，又須負擔鉅額支出，事涉重徵，經於昨日代電財經兩部呼籲，請准予免貼云。</p>
<h3>美桐油專家意見　供給量僅及需要三分一　改進品質並須減少剝削</h3>
<p>中美農業技術團美國團員柯賴博士，爲桐油專家本年六月奉派來我國考察桐油生產現狀，昨由京來滬，轉乘飛機返美，行前對記者談改進我國桐油事業意見：（一）目前中國桐汕生產銳减，僅及戰前半數，估計本年產量至多不過六萬公噸，約合一萬萬三千餘尤磅，戰時桐油價低，植桐無利，乃其减產主要原因，（二）桐油爲最佳之乾性油，如價格合理，市塲穩定，供應正常，世界消費量估討可達五萬萬磅（約合二十二萬七千餘公噸），本年全世界桐油產量，預計不過一萬萬五千餘萬磅，僅及世界消費量三分之一弱，中國必須迅速增產方克供應世界消費，吾刻供不應求，桐油之工業用途，將漸爲其他乾性油及代用品所奪取，（三）桐油生產零散，不能利用新法榨取，品質不一且常攙雜，此後必須集中生產，方能减低成本，提高品質，（四）桐油非森林產品，桐樹不能聽其自生自滅，必須視爲園藝作物，以栽培菓樹方法管理之，如選擇優良品種，着重無性繁殖，種於沃土，去草施肥，防治病蟲害等，方能發揮其生產效能，（五）桐油現多產於山區，運輸困難，中間轉手過多，桐盤收益太少，必須改良運銷，减低運費，並减少中間人之剝削，方能鼓勵農民推廣植桐，柯氏最後並以堅定之語氣作結論稱，在最近五年內，桐油量的增加應重於質的改進，增產須迅速而有計劃，務期產製，運銷打成一片云。</p>
<h3>白煤價回跌　到貨多銷路滯</h3>
<p>煤市白煤塊行市回跌以來。銷路仍難展開，賣戶方面因辦本關係，亦不願再自動喊低，除有大量進戶，再行議價，約照市低五萬元至十萬元不等，到貨蟬聯，市勢頗爲虛軟，昨又有南昌輸運來鴻基塊二千餘噸，現卸浦東燃管會一棧，並麥根路車站亦有焦作塊焦炭運到數車，每車約二三十噸云。而煙煤市况仍因配貨稀少，廠需殷盛，趨勢極爲俏俐。配貨同業互做價，每組貼費已至四十二四萬元。</p>
<h3>修正貨物稅條例</h3>
<p>（立法院十一月十一日修正通過）（續）</p>
<p>第四條，貨物稅稅率如左，</p>

<p>（十三）化妝品從價征收百分之四十五。</p>
<p>第五條，課征貨物稅之貨物，應以出產地附近市塲每三個月平均之批發價格爲完稅價格之計算根據。」前項平均批發價格，包括（甲）該貨完稅價格，（乙）原納貨物稅之數，即該貨物完稅價格應征稅率之數，（丙）由出產地運達附近市塲所需費用，定爲完稅價格百分之十。</p>
<p>產地附近市塲之平均批發價格×100÷（100＋該貨物稅率之數十由產地至附近市塲所需費用即10）＝核定之完稅價格</p>
<p>征收貨物稅之貨物，爲便利稽征計，財政部得斟酌情形，採行分級征稅，其分級計稅辦法，由財政部定之。（未完）</p>
<h3>燒碱狂瀉　客銷無利可圖</h3>
<p>燒碱昨日狂瀉每桶十萬元，據業中人云，因外埠價格與滬市相差無幾，所以各客帮無意裝出口，各方逢高脫貨求現，證實前幾天之狂漲，多是投機作用，嗣後可能續跌，漂粉硫黃有到貨。</p>
<h3>平粉銷路日狹　希望減低配價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據麵粉商業中人談：目前本市各麵粉廠，已日可產粉三萬袋。其中除一萬二千袋撥交各麵粉商配售外，其餘一萬八千袋，各麵粉廠多自向黑市拋售，以致連日黑市粉價，已跌至每袋一萬九千二百元。而平價配售粉，每袋尙須二萬〇五百元。故平價配粉銷路趨狹，每日前去領購者，已减至六千袋。故深望當局能再考慮减低配粉價格云。</p>

<h3>形勢緊張而不精彩　黑白敗於征輪隊　五十五比十五三相差一球　黑白女子旗開得勝</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕菲島華僑黑白藍毬隊，昨晚第二戰，逢強敵洛陽征輪隊，四十分鍾大戰，黑白不幸以五十三比五十五分受挫，上半時黑白以二十五比二十二佔先三分。僵局比賽，始終在狀態中，分數相距二三分間，直至最後幾分鍾征輪連中，方始決定戰局。</p>
<p>旗鼓相當　硬拼若幹</p>
<p>昨晚之戰，可謂勢均力敵，旗鼓相當，形勢雖緊張，精彩則不多，征輪較往日減色，戰法混亂，投擲不凖，黑白則亦在硬幹，未見有方法，於是祇看見雙方在硬拚亂打，黑白投藍亦不如羣聲，打來亦無羣聲之美，殊不勝令人戀戀於羣聲也。雙方勝負，各無把握，殊非政黨之狀態。黑白男子受挫，子女則旗開得勝，表演得相當精彩。</p>
<p>黑白女子　旗開得勝</p>
<p>五時三刻，女子組登塲，黑白女初顯身手，與青聯交綏，賽前雙方隊長互贈錦旗，青聯徐佩珍先開紀錄，黑白陳玉潤照樣奉敬，第一節終十對八，黑白佔優，前半結束，黑白以卅七對十五遙領。休息過後，重行交兵，青聯王務醴簡志光入代柳惠珊胡玉如，惟青聯益見不振，黑白戰來仍極得心應手，第三節終黑白四四青聯十七，結果，黑白女以四十九比廿九大厜青聯，旗開得勝。</p>

<h3>吉林教廳長胡體乾　談東北近代文化　表現中國堅韌民族性</h3>
<p>〔中央社長春十四日電〕吉教廳長胡體乾語記者，東北近代文化，可分三期，第一期爲掌包人，（掌包人即管錢包者），文化時期，應爲滿清及其末葉，直至「九一八」時，當時本地以及由冀魯移來松遼兩河流域間之人民，多從事各種産業，均有掌包者，對事業及環境，均有遠見，且具創造性，對開發東北文化，極爲重要，此可喻爲美洲開發時之哲斐遜性之人物。第二期爲要視察人（此爲日語，即被征服者心猶未甘，須加防範者）文化時期，應在「九一八」之後，東北人民自「九一八」後，人心向祖國，而與暴力始終抗衡，日人借東北人力物力，有所建設，但文化本質未變，此可喻爲俄國沙皇時代後期之灰色文學。第三期爲從業員文化，此即勝利以來，東北各種從業員，於混亂中盡力保存各種建設之偉大表現，彼等爲以生命與事業相搏鬥，如錦州鐵路員工擊弊縱火者，以及小　滿發電所之保存，均爲顯著之事例，此實爲中國民族性堅韌之獨特表現。胡氏爲長春人，留學美芝加哥大學五年，研究社會學，曾任廣州大學法學院主任。</p>

<h3>白帆點點綠水悠悠　安東風光旖旎</h3>
<p>— 本報東北特派員　韓清濤九日航訊</p>
<p>鴨絲江的碧水，沿着中韓國界流，從白頭山發源地，蜒蜿二百餘里，流人了黃海，白帆點點，「流筏」相接，形成了鴨綠江上的壯觀。</p>
<p>小型的船隻，溯江而上，可以到達長白以西的十三道溝，中等的船隻，來往於安東上下游，龐大的輪船，多在江口多獅島拋錨，鴨綠江在航運上，起着很大的作用。</p>
<p>鴨綠江上游，臨江到長白一帶，山勢險峻，峰　聳立，高達八百至一千公尺，有繁密的大森林，左右兩岸森林面積，據日人估計的有十六萬二千六百多哩，但因無計劃的砍伐，損害頗大，商人伐木，組成木筏，長遠里許，順流而下，達於安東市大江橋，每年以六，七，八等月是流筏盛期，江岸木材堆積如山，所以安東又有「木都」的頭銜。</p>
<p>從上遊漂下來的貸物，除了佔第一位的木材以外，就要算大豆，豆粕，高粱，包米，小豆，和蠶繭等，從安東市化行的計有：棉，絲，布，鹽，麵粉，石汕，火柴等上游人民生活必需品，從安東到海口間的貨運，多爲輸出品和運來的布疋。安東以上結冰期在十一月下旬到來年的三月間。</p>
<p>民國三十二年間，日僞爲了建設「水豐」大電力廠，修築堰堤，杜絕不筏直達安東市，所以站在鴨綠江橋頭，已經看不到形成巨覜的「流筏」，加以鴨綠江上游尙未安定，一切貨運，都得等待來年初夏了！</p>

<p>敵偽時期的「大東港」建設，也是一樁値得重視的計劃和工程，該港在鴨綠江口，形勢天成，落成後可爲東北唯一的不凍良港，港後劃有足容一百萬人口的市區和廣大的工業區域，佔地達一百七十六方公里，打算造成一個大的工業都市。</p>
<p>杜聿明將軍，爲了看看大東港的形勢，在由安市視察戰事，飛回潘陽時，特令飛機南飛，記者們隨行，在大東港上空盤旋，海水蒼茫，鴨綠江失去了碧綠，變成了一股濁流洩入海中，一串小山，伸進海面，成了很好的港灣和門戶，氣勢頗壯，可異的是沒看到建設工程。</p>
<p>大東港建設目標，在使載重四千公噸，吃水七·四公尺的船隻，在中潮水位，可以自由行駛，幷有足容貨船四艘同時裝卸的碼頭和倉庫，再修一條長二十四公里的鐵路，從大東港直達安東市，將來成功的時候，可成爲東北四大港口中的一個重要港口。</p>
<p>滿山遍野是寶藏</p>
<p>安東，僅安東市縣沿江臨海一帶，形成一狹長的平原，其餘西北部多爲山地，所以礦藏頗豐，最著名的是桓仁和寬甸兩地的鐵礙，已經大量開採，寬甸還有鎢礦，在計劃採掘中。鳳城有鉛礦。礦山在靑城子一帶，在前已由偽「滿洲礦山靑城子礦業所」採掘，礦石含有少量的銀和亞鉛，每月的產鉛一萬二千噸，是我國有數的產鉛地方，安東具有黃銅礦，已由僞「淸水礦業所」採掘，含有量的爲百分之三十，一月的處理量是十五噸，此外全省尙藏有石綿，雲母，磁石，金，銀，螢石，石灰石，煤炭等各種礦產。</p>
<p>偽滿的通化省，光復後劃歸了安東，長白，撫松，臨江，通化，輯安，輝南，金川，柳河，濛江，又是一個大礦產區域。鐵，煤，金，銀，銅，鉛，錦，白金，水銀，石綿，雲母，黑鉛，石灰石，耐火粘土，硫化鐵礦等，都很豐當，據云煤藏量可佔東北總藏量的二成，僞滿時，煤鐵兩礦，大半都由「東邊道開發會社」，從事開發，同時幷在礦地鍊鐵，當時除了日人絲制外的煤礦，還有渾江煤礦等十三處，都統轄在僞滿民國三十一年設立的「通化省煤礦組合」的裏而，日人「東邊道開發會社」所開發的主要礦產，計有臨江縣的大栗子鐵山，通化市七道溝鐵山，鐵廠子煤山，五道江煤山，右人溝煤田，烟筒溝煤山等，金，銀，砂金，多在鴨綠江一帶，銀，銅，雲母，黑鉛礦，在輯安，石灰石，在通化，又柳河，輝南，金川等地，都是廣大的石灰石地帶，石灰石是製鐵事業不可少的原料，過去已有七處開採，今天，地而尙未安定，一切都期待在將來！</p>
<p>〔木都〕和〔森林省〕</p>
<p>安東有「木都」的頭銜，光復後劃歸安東的前偽通化省，又有「森林省」的稱呼，從長白山麓延長到西北方的輝南一帶，森林茂盛，遮天蔽日，形成一大蒼鬱的樹海，此外景原有的森林，因爲被人任意砍伐，已經多半禿了。</p>
<p>剛剛由　國軍收復的鐵路，因爲共軍徹底的破壞，道軌散失了，枕木燒毀了，費盡氣力搜集來了鐵軌，沒有這木，不能舖設起來，葉柏壽到赤峯的路綫，潘陽到海龍的路綫，潘安錢上的巾間一段，都是這般情景，所以需要道木的數目字是相當龐大的，驚人的！</p>
<p>國軍收復安東了，缺乏枕木的問題，可以得到部份解決了，同時爲了開礦所需的支撑和舖架的木材，也可有了着落，安東省政府爲了共應各方迫切的需要，已經派建設廳長等多人，前往輝南和濛江間的森林區視察，以便採伐，好得早日恢復交通。</p>
<p>稻米香·魚兒肥</p>
<p>號稱五百萬人民的安東，裏面含着二十多萬的日本和朝鮮人，現在日本和朝鮮人，多半的被遺送了，剩下來的已經是少數，過去，日人是統治者，技術人員，商人，鮮人多半種稻田，和爲虎作倀的人們，這次國軍進城和社將軍　明蒞安東視察，鮮人男女老幼，持着八卦國旗，列隊歡迎，雙手高舉，大呼萬歲。</p>
<p>安東的敎育”因大部份的地區，位處閉塞的山地，所以沒有合理的發展，其中要以安東市，莊河，鳳城，通化等城市，較比好些，師資缺乏，經費無着落，學生程度低淺，是當前嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>農人當然還是佔全人口數之大多數，安東的稻米是很有名的，其中首推鳳城，那裏所產的稻米，吃起來是滿够味的；也有些是漁人，因爲安東市到莊河，約有三百浬的海岸綫，蝦·鯢·大刀魚·小蝦米·金頭魚·白魚·都有豐富出產，日偽幷擬於莊河的大五家島，建設海洋漁業的港灣，幷於那裏栽植海帶的幼芽，以期鮑蛤類的移殖；在深山裏活動的獵人和採藥材的人們也很多，像通化省著名特產物藥用人參，年可產四十萬斤，獸皮，山貨，藥草，也很多；此外柞蠶的飼育，繅絲，織綢也很有名，安東市元寳山麓的八道溝，就有好多的製絲工廠。</p>
<p>年來安東省新興工業，頗稱發達，汽車，洋灰，造船，紡織，膠皮，精鍊，輕金屬工業等，都有很好的出品，可惜的是：光復後，外人的搬運，自己家裏人的破壞，現在正不知如何　能善其後呢。</p>
<p>溫泉好　滑雪妙</p>
<p>安東風光綺麗，特殊享受頗多，在潘安綫上距離安東市西北方四十里的「五龍背」，是和遼寧南部的「湯岡子」，和「熊岳城」，並稱三姊妹的大溫泉，據傳唐太宗征高勾麗，曾在這裏駐節沐浴，從前舊「滿鐵」經營，設有五龍閣，保養館，聚樂館等旅館，設備都很舒適，另外有龍泉荘和水明莊等私營浴舍，泉質無色透明，一日湧出量千八百石，攝氏七十度，對於醫療皮膚病，神經痛，腸胃病，貧血症等，都有很大的帮助，所幸這次沒遭共軍的破壞。</p>
<p>通化四面環山，冬季　量較多，且不融化，是一天然大滑雪堪，日僞曾設置南山，龍泉，驚山，花甸子，銀廠等滑雪塲，民國卅二年二月間，日僞也曾在這裏，開了一次所謂「東亞滑雪大會」，滑雪塲設有四十五公尺的一個大飛躍臺，一個練習塲，可容百人，滑雪男女，從山頂滑下山坡，飛越高岡，山谷，急馳，跳躍，構成銀色世界裏一幅美麗的　圖。</p>

<h3>察晉綏視察記　長城內外（四）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　杭舟</p>
<p>張垣的初冬</p>
<p>不刮風，張垣的初冬是仍然可愛的。我們在張垣的幾天，據說是難有的好天氣。在平滑的柏油路上蹓躂，欣賞那些來自沙漠的龐然大物—駱駝的四條腿的搖擺，那個奇妙的駝峯的願動，頗有粗獷的詩味。這裘已是內蒙古，蒙漢人雜居在一起，組看分不出來。回胞在這裏有幾百人，堅守着他們的敎規，與非敎徒是不大往來的。他們各自爲生，一向相安無事。外籍的敎徒在這裏有百人，其中百分之九十是白俄人，現在已經恢復蘇聯籍；之外，有瑞典、挪威、比利時等國人。張垣的總人口，據最近調査是十四萬零八百餘人。</p>
<p>地方秩序在收復五天後即已恢復。十二戰區長官部有「臨時政務委員會」的組織，其工作較戰區政治部尤爲廣泛實際。當傅作義氏被任爲察哈爾省政府主席。在正式接事之前，這一委員會便暫時負責察哈爾及張垣的行政。它與軍隊同時行動，所以軍政的配合毫無問題。臨時政務會秘書長周鈞，曾任綏遠省政府秘書長，現兼代張垣市長，聽說有出任察哈爾省政府秘書長的可能。臨政會是暫時的組織，待察哈爾省政府組織後，就結束工作。</p>
<p>目前，臨政會所從事的工作中，値得重視的是有關於土地問題的處理。臨政會根據中央所頒綏靖區施政綱領參照當地實際情形訂定工作要領，其中對土地問題之處理，訂定辦法如次：</p>
<p>一、各縣設立土地處理委員會，調査土地現狀，公評處理土地分配及地租糾紛。</p>
<p>二、被共黨沒收淸算之土地，地主應提出土地所有權狀，准其無價領回。如土地所有權狀遺失，應由該管轄之保甲長及靠近其土地兩家鄰家地戶之書面證明，准其無價領回。</p>
<p>三、領得共黨淸算分配土地之耕種人，得繼續保持土地使用權，但須對地主納租。</p>
<p>四、地主得保有產權，但須依照規定限制畝數，並實行二五减租收租。</p>
<p>五、爲實行民生主義之土地政策，應逐漸實行耕者有其田，一面限制私有土地之畝數，一面由農民銀行貸款農民購買所需耕種之土地。</p>
<p>六、無主土地收歸公有。不在地主之土地收歸政府暫行保管。</p>
<p>七、政府對公地及無主土地及地主超過限制之土地應集中管理，或定價收購爲國有公有，辦理公營農塲，合作農塲，或配給復員官兵及出征軍人家屬耕種。</p>
<p>又關於收復區被共黨沒收及淸算分配之土地，本年度收穫物資之處理，亦訂定暫行辦法如次：</p>
<p>一、被共黨淸算分配之土地，其產權仍歸原地主，承種人保有收穫櫂，但須向原地王繳納百分之一五收穫物或代價。</p>
<p>二、被共黨沒收之土地收穫物，依下列辦法辦理之：</p>
<p>Ａ被共黨沒收，由共黨自耕之土地收穫物，如經證明有地主者，給予原地主百分之一五收穫物或代價，餘歸公。</p>
<p>Ｂ被共黨沒收之土地，如係交由農民代耕，，經證明有地主者，代耕人應向原地主繳納百分之一五收穫物或代價，餘歸代耕人。</p>
<p>Ｃ被共黨沒收之土地，如無地主，移交由農民代耕者，代耕人應向公家繳納百分之一五收穫物或代價，餘歸代耕人。</p>
<p>Ｄ被共黨沒收自耕之土地，如無地主，其收穫物全部歸公。</p>
<p>這樣的處理辦法是公允合理的。施行的結果，預料的糾紛都順利解決。</p>
<p>由於交通的阻塞，郵政局還沒有運來足够的郵票，在張垣寄信，像原始的方式一樣，是由收信人付郵資的。這兒還沒有黃金和美鈔的市價。各項物價，以布疋最貴，糧食尙稱便宜。至於那些爲人們所稱道的皮貨，可口的麻姑，雖然眞正名貴的己爲共軍擄掠以去，而留下的那些貨色，商人們奇貨可居，一件中等的狐皮統子已經要賣到七八十萬元了。（十日）</p>

<h3>緬甸橋胞歸航</h3>
<p>— 陳樹榮</p>
<p>十五日仰光航訊</p>
<p>緬甸的雨季快要過去了，在道幾月的雨季中，仰光河濱的江水，由於海水的潮浪，波動江水，晨曦時光順流入海，夕陽薄暮逆流滔滔，河濱一帶無形中成了公園，華僑男女時常有人在這兒蹓躂散步，觀潮水的起伏，望停泊江心的海艦多麼壯觀，然而緊壓在華僑心上的問題，却是海路何日通船？讓戰爭離散了的親人重新歡聚，讓淪陷在仰光，從虎口裏活出來的人，繞風光美麗的檳榔嶼，文化重鎭的新嘉坡，回到祖國的廣州，廈門，福州，看望看望髮已斑白，門齒脫落的年邁雙親，道種省親團圓的心思結着大多數華僑的心緒，終於好消息傳來了，聯合國救濟總署派員運送歸僑要到仰光了，該船也可載華僑回到祖國。</p>
<p>當十月八日駐仰光總領事館向報紙發出了消息—豐慶輸首次來仰，將於九月抵達本埠，此次聯總遺送歸僑，共計一千九百餘名，內梅縣歸僑一百八十名，閩僑五十名，粤僑一千六百七十多名，這樣的消息帶給人了多少興奮的情緒，也給一些婦女姊妹帶來了無限的傷痛。有位婦女早知道丈夫歸來是偕同着「抗戰夫人」，神經刺戟的澈夜不能成眠，用筆傾吐出她內心的傷痛，她這麽說：「殘忍兇暴的戰魔，牠不單毀壞了人間的和平，並且殺害了家庭夫婦間的純潔愛情；人間的和平現已恢復了，祇可惜那純潔的愛情一死就再不會活過來了！……當一種謠傳變成了現實，或是接到來書，原以爲是通知啓航日程，結果變成了報吿重婚的事實，這時候那『遺棄怨婦」的一方面是多麼失望和痛苦啊！……中國女性並未眞眞得到與男子平等的地位，所以吃虧的十居其九都是女性。離婚嗎？何以自存！改醮嗎？男人和女人們更一鼻孔出氣的駡你「失節墮行」！這是多麼殘酷的枷鎖！難道全國姊妹們就讓這沉重的枷鎖永遠嚴繫直到地球的末日嗎？……我不痛哭流涕，也不背人掩泣，我不自殺，也不削髮做尼姑！我雖沒有積蓄，還有兩個孩子須待敎養，但我總不相信自己不能自立，總不相信女人不能自食其力，離開了丈夫就要餓死！……當你丈夫跟你遠離以後，假如你是崇信佛敎的，你不是常向慈悲的觀音，至心皈命俯首膜拜，祝你丈夫早日回來團聚麼？假如你是崇信基督的，你不是常在主之前，懺悔罪惡，誠心禱吿祝你丈夫愛心無改麽？這都是多餘的事，我也曾經做了一輩的傻子，男人習慣了壓迫女性，以爲「米已成炊」，妻子終可見諒的。像男人這種暴行，不能讓牠繼續存留，我們要謀經濟的獨立，奠定兩性間的平等地位。』</p>
<p>十月九日這天，報載午後二時，豐慶號船即可抵達仰光，時間還沒到十二時，仰光五號碼頭的兩旁，早就站滿了男女老幼，瞭望水天相接處的船影，時間一秒一秒的過去，竚立在岸上的人心充滿了無限的渴望，終於午後二時壯觀的豐慶號輪船到了。汽笛一聲長鳴，岸上人頭鑽動，船上的歸僑也恨不能立刻登上岸來。　這時，尹總領事，劉副領事同英政府的海關，衛生，福利，警察，等機關首領，乘了小汽艇先到大船上去，炎熱的陽光照射着閃動的江水，也反映着人們歡欣的心波。稍經接洽交涉了一番，歸僑們手執護照證件，爸爸抱着小妹妹，媽媽拖着小弟弟，魚貫而入龐大的海關檢査所。歸僑們的精神雖然因海上生活的疲勞顯得頽靡，可是在四週環顧中，突然發見了親戚朋友，立刻狂歡的舉手，不停的揮動，互相招呼，互頌平安，這是浩刦之後的重逢，多麽慶幸啊！這時總領事指揮着歸僑，熱誠的講了一番話，歡迎他們平安的到了仰光，希望他們平安的生活下去。因之這一千多人沒有名單，詳細登記的項目如姓名住址，過去職業，親戚關係，今後動向等，一時沒法塡寫，爲了辦事手續的淸楚，又把歸僑弄回船艙內挨了一夜，羿日正逢國慶紀念，他們和她們順利的回到了自己的家，或是鄉親的會館。看到青天白日滿地紅的國旗到處飄揚。</p>

<h3>秋天的散文</h3>
<p>— 何風</p>
<p>秋天或許是詩的季節，却的確是散文的季節。</p>
<p>你用抬頭向天。秋天的天空，萬里無雲，淡藍的天幕，却在正中按上一輪光芒四射的太陽，光芒照在身上，不太熱，暖洋洋地直呌人喜歡。微風吹拂，帶着山野的草花香，你不是會想起了城市外的無邊的曠野嗎？你不會在一個晴朗的假日，上那裏去呼吸一口新鮮的空氣嗎？躺在比沙發還軟的草地上，望着高山，流水，白雲，與因着太陽強烈的照耀而反射着金黃色的閃光的稻穗，似乎是怕羞吧！都一齊俯倒了頭，不敢仰視，一陣風趕過來，田中也跟着起了一陣洶湧的波浪，閃光着金黃色，一直波動到遙遠的天邊。脚邊不知名的小野花，發散着幽香，遠處天際，翱翔着三五飛鳥。長久的凝視，也使你體味出自然的美麗了，靜寂使你沉默，使你於不知不覺中想起往事，因而消磨去整個下午。這是最偉大的山水畫，最美麗的風景圖，幾小時的欣賞，準能滌淨了你城市的庸俗和身心的疲倦，這就是秋天的散文，秋天的田野的散文。</p>
<p>或許你喜歡高山和樹林，甚于原野，我就知道你是秋天山中如火如茶的楓林了。所以你會不避艱險，遠道跑上山去。眞奇怪呢！遠看簡直是野孩子放的野火，火勢眞旺，火舌四散伸吐，可又不見那火蔓延開來。走近了，那火更旺更紅，但一切還不是好好的，像手掌一般形狀的小葉片，隨風吹散，連地上也鋪上了一層火，那是楓林—秋天的楓林。四圍當然是靜靜的，你也會靜靜的坐下來默想，再打開你的寫生版，寫下那天上的白雲和這塲偉大的火景，或是翻開你的書，低誦一首淸新的詩，一節美麗的散文。假使那山上還有溪澗，乘着澗水還沒有枯涸，在暖和的秋天你一定會找到那裏，在那課濯足，像小孩子一樣，在那裏玩水，築上一座水閘，或是在堅硬的山土上，開浚出一條小運河，更應和着澎湃的水聲，你會唱一曲高亢雄壯的歌調，顧盼羣山，也儼然有英雄之慨，這是山間的散文。</p>
<p>說起花吧！秋天的花何嘗比春天遜色呢！屈指數着，深紅的洋牡丹，淡赤的雁來紅，黃色的美人樓，……不得不特別提起的，那就是秋天的菊花了。愛花的人，還有誰會不愛菊花的呢？那樣的高傲，如出世之隱士；那樣的淸麗，似淡粧的美人；那樣的神奇，簡直數不淸她的種類與顏色；對着她，俗人也會得到典雅的啓示。就是山野間的野菊花，也是可愛的。像天上的一羣繁星，綴在一根瘦弱的梗枝上，很少有綠葉點綴，隨風擺搖，芳香四溢。再說桂花吧！那也夠令人低徊的了。靜靜的播散着那樣高貴的香味，造成一個散文的氛圍，嬌小雅淡的花朶，不也是花中的雋品麼？雖是花開易謝，足稱憾事，但那種香氣，却已足夠爲秋生色。至於詩人頭上的月桂冠，韻事留傳，又何嘗不是花中的佳話，這就是花的散文。</p>
<p>秋天的夜，那樣高，那樣爽凈，點綴滿了繁星；秋天的月，那樣明朗，那樣皎潔，中秋夜的明月，更分外圓，天空也更分外高；除了年輕不懂事的小孩，誰忍輕棄了這樣美麗的夜景，這樣難逢的佳節，不等到看過了月華，眼皮也不肯再受神經的控制了，這才戀戀不捨回房就寢。秋天的星，也分外小，分外亮，亮得令人可愛。至於秋天的白雲，那也是不能和別個季節相比擬的，舒卷在天空中，襯着蔚藍的穹蒼，每一秒鐘，都在變幻，那樣的善變，眞非人類所能描繪。祇要一眨眼，變了！從前是一只白色的北極熊，現在却是一株雪天的落葉松了，披了一件白色的外衣；也許再一眨眼，便會成一匹雄駿的白馬呢？這一切又是多麼的神秘，這便是夜與雲的散文了。</p>
<p>秋天很少雨，可是一括了東北風，氣候驟然冷下來，隨便會飄拂起細細的秋雨來了，雨細得眞像綫，長長的，似斷却又永遠不會斷，飄飄斜斜，一出門，就會沾上一身水；一下雨，就是十天半月，似乎是永遠沒有晴朗的日子了。這便是惱人的秋雨，倘若你客居他鄕，舉目無親，你的鄕思，不是會被牠喚起來麼？假使你病臥在別地，深夜，聽着這種單調的風雨聲，燭火搖晃，好像鬼魅即將現形，你不會油然興起凄凉寂寞之　嗎？就是在白天，瞧着那種灰晴冥晦的天色，還有誰會不煩愁麼？平生的坎坷不得意事，一齊都會一箍腦兒兜上心頭來。秋雨裏絕沒有歡笑，却帶來了淡淡的哀愁，好像是微微帶澀的橄欖，却有着無窮的回憶，這便是秋雨的散文。</p>
<p>連蟲豸也都得推秋天呢，秋夜，牆角庭畔，一組組的交響樂隊，便開始演奏了。一切不知名的音樂家，都各奏着一種奇異的旋律—大都是悲凉的，像邊塞的胡笳一樣—此應復和，永不會因疲倦而停歇，非到天明不肯罷休，這便是秋聲，音樂的散文。</p>
<p>秋天象徵着靜寂，孤獨，一切沉靜，冷淸淸地像古人一曲廣陵散，沒有絲亳狂熱的節奏；祇是一層幽淡寂寞的薄網，使你在其中沉思欣賞；祇是一幅畫，並不是一本好萊塢的五彩電影。一切靜寂而安定，沒有狂熱，沒有神奇，因此沒有小說，很少詩，却有無窮盡的散文—秋天的散文。</p>
<h3>詩與現實</h3>
<p>— 駱賓家</p>
<p>世界是是廣闊而豐富的，人生更是異常的變幻而複雜，所以決不會苦於沒有做時的感興；不過詩却不可不是「即興詩」，這就是說，現實是供給詩的源源不絕的成因和材料。（引自「歌德對話錄」）</p>
<h3>菊藝</h3>
<p>— 春苔</p>
<p>種植淺說</p>
<p>賞菊之期，至多半月，而培植之時一年未得稍間，明瞭種菊之難以後，參觀菊花展覽會者賞菊的興趣必更富厚了。</p>
<p>陶淵明所愛的菊花，遠不如現在所見的富麗變化，至今所稱爲「陶愛菊」即爲古種，是黃色細瓣的小花。此種野菊，經人工培養，就逐漸增大變化了。</p>
<p>春夏之交，折菊枝二三寸，插入土中，一週後即生根長發，秋時開花，較老枝所開者爲大。是爲插枝。</p>
<p>用菊枝接在另一菊本或蒿本上，其花更大，是爲接枝。接枝可使一本中開花數千朶，或紅白黃各色在一本上齊開，成爲奇異的盆景。</p>
<p>但插枝與接枝所開的花除增大以外，花的形狀顏色，均與原花絲亳無異。</p>
<p>近來所見新奇的菊種，並非天然而係人工產生者，即取菊花兩種，於開花時使之交配，而後取其成熟的種子下種發芽，是謂籽種。籽種所開花朶，即爲父種與母種的混合或折衷性，產生新的花樣。黃園主人岳淵先生所植（插圖中（一））可名爲「杏紅旗」者，即新種之美者。</p>
<p>交配時須與化花隔離，於未開花時置花房內，或玻璃窗邊，不要開窗，以免空氣中的野花粉穿竄潛入。（拙着「北京乎」中已有詳述）。</p>
<p>父種與母種二者如花開高低不齊，須用磚石墊至等高，使兩花相同對吻。花乾後，取兩花心的扁薄種子，於明春下種，即可發芽分種。所憾此種新種，多不成品，大約百盆中僅得二三種而已，而一年的培植均須周到無缺。凡菊謝以後，花子均可採種，但其結果雜亂無章，較人工配合者更難得成功。</p>
<p>此次展覽會中，劉金潮君之綠荷（二），金錫榮君之托桂（三）均有價値；尚有市政府工務局之銀針（四），新華農塲之黃梅（五），亦屬罕見者。惟參加展覽者以獨枝式較易致勝。</p>
<h3>菊</h3>
<p>— 孫福熙</p>
<h3>黃花</h3>
<p>— 石碚</p>
<p>我的窗外，雜草叢生，早晨鋪過一導白霜，草葉的綠色都脫掉了，剩下枯黃低垂的頭。這些綠色的生命快要結束了；只有草僜是，矯健地挺着幾株黃花，熬着霜露，衝破了這個寂季節的氣氛。縱然是小小的黃花，又是一支多麼倔強的生命呵！</p>
<p>陽光慢慢的撥開一層薄霧，照下來了。花朶浴着陽光，便透出一些金輝的顏色；在花葉上逐漸消化了的霜痕，也滲進一些溫暖的氣流了。</p>
<p>深秋的黃花，不像迎春開放的玫瑰，那些嫣紅紫綠的，像凝儲惆賬的微笑，瞬息便歸幻滅。也不像夏日的榴紅，那般強烈閃灼；那些開在白雪枝頭的臘梅，可又顯得過於冷淸了。只有這秋節的黃花，像一個敦厚的故人一樣，遙遠地向你申出溫暖誠篤的手。看見了它，不消說，我們會像一個踏遍荒蕪草徑浪游歸來的人，願意佇足徘徊在它的身邊。它不會用輕笑淺顰，來誘惑你，也不會用熟練挑撥的情緒，來激動你的心。它呌你思念逝去的時光，要你忠實於自己，收束起靑春的狂放！靜對黃花，你會有更多的舊情，你像是歡喜，又像是哀愁。</p>
<p>黃花也是貞忠的象徵。你有過旅居在一個古老山城裏的經騐嗎？屢年的風沙，已經剝蝕掉山城的精華了，頹殘的城闕，儘是沒落荒漠，連昔日守城烈士的故事，已經推動眞實的流傳了。但是看見城頭一年一度的黃花，能牽引你的思索，和這古城產生親切的關聯，你想着：黃花下的黃土，曾埋下多少烈士的白骨，洒落多少人民的血淚；歷史幾番的滄桑刦難。這些古壘的史實，恰像一城暮色，你要爲它劃開一個嶄新的天地。</p>
<p>或者你在疏落的籬邊，讓那些野生的黃花結伴地長着，牠們茁壯明潔，在落暉淺淡的光景裏，你和自己的影子躑躅了一會，這時雖然是看見庭前落葉飄零，或者是遇着秋風斜雨，然而你仍覺得秋景的可愛。</p>
<p>我冥坐在室內，看着窗外的天，這些寒花晚節，不正是「不羞老圃秋容淡，且看寒花晚節香，」嗎？秋畢竟帶給我一些喜訊。</p>

<p>紫燕</p>
<p>聽說世間有種呌作紫燕的鳥，那是生長在海邊，專門喜與浪潮鬥的，當牠們一嗅到大風暴將來時，牠們就飛起迎戰了。</p>
<p>而像向日葵一樣隨着太陽遷移的候鳥，也是美麗的：每次遷移中，不知有多少小鳥或老鳥落在海中，即使幸或遇見一隻大洋中的輪船，正可給牠們歇脚或覓食，據說却很少有再飛的能力，於是成了別人的糧食，或依然落入海中，就是再飛了起來吧，飛越了海洋之後更有無限的沙漠……那行程是遠遠而艱巨的。</p>
<p>雖然旅途是這樣艱苦，却從未聽到誰家樑上的燕子免除了任何一年朝聖者似的跋涉。</p>
<p>誓</p>
<p>沒有誰再比害病的人更愛生命的吧？因爲他生活在死邊緣。</p>
<p>藍天，白雲，花，風，陽光，窗外的行人……都使人留戀啊！像以前從沒接觸或瞭解過一樣。</p>
<p>如今我知道了，這一切就是生命！</p>
<p>以往的日子全是浪費了。</p>
<p>我若再度獲得生命就好了，在那些日子裏，我將如何充實地生活啊！決不讓一些微的時間或事物在我身邊溜過。</p>
<h3>賞菊</h3>
<p>— 許士騏</p>
<p>和澤周三春，淸凉素秋節，</p>
<p>露凝無遊氛，天高風景澈。（陶潛時）</p>
<p>九年來，封鎖在崇山峻嶺，蜀道崎嶇，婆娑占樹，松竹幽居的嘉陵江畔。經過了一個悠久的歲月，車返江南。祭社秋高氣爽，羣芳吐艷的黃金時節，（歐洲俗語）詩人畫家，對着這豐富而多變化的色調，絢麗而溫潤的陽光，發生了無限生趣；自然的偉大，就是能夠貢獻這不斷的創造，給人類心靈的撫慰！</p>
<p>我忙裏偷閒，去欣賞了一次，市公務員舉辦的復興公園菊花展覽五色繽紛，花團集錦，其中佳種有「冰盤托桂」，「黃鶯出谷」，「雪靈山」，「金瓣荷」等；而尤以黃園主人，出品最擅勝塲。憶陸　莊詠白　詩：「月朶暮開無絕艷，風勁時動有奇香，一點綴這淸凉素秋的時節，洗滌了幾日來紛擾俗慮。」</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　94</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「把手上傢伙仍了。……加！」那傢伙像背書似的，一字一吐，慢呑呑地命令着，聲音十分嚴厲。日人十九都是矮鬼，這傢伙却有近六呎的高大個子，聽那聲音，我知道他身體壯實；從他這獨自一人，不動聲色，探索到這裏的一點上看，可知他詭譎奸詐。他居然一人做着搜索工作，可知他的胆量，也知他必有過人的技能，本領。</p>
<p>我和虎弟聽了他的話，只得把手中的槍，仍在當地。這時面對着我們的，是手提機槍，和這虎狼一般的倭軍；身後邊却是大量的汽油和已經引燃燒着的火繩，並且我們兩人現在所處，正是日軍秘密魔窟的禁衛區內，所謂軍事的心臟，還有，他們現在已經發動全部警備，這傢伙後面，也許還有其他搜索的人和狗，跟踪前來，也僅僅只要這傢伙發出一個警號，那全部探照燈，向這裏一集中，全隊人狗向這裏一跑，我們要想逃走，恐怕眞比登天還難！</p>
<p>「拼了？」而祇要虎弟把第二隻槍搯出來一下，不問能否那麼迅疾的將敵人打中，敵人必定開槍，也只要他一開槍，地上的汽油必定着火。僅僅只要這半秒不到的時間，一轉手臂的動作，就是我與敵人死亡的關頭。話雖如此，不過我認爲還未曾達到最後拚命的時機。這，太需要急智，或天賜的好機會了。</p>
<p>「小姨，地上的火怎麼辦？」虎弟問我，雖是照例舉着手，却把身子閃開一步，好像故意叫敵人看見地上已經燒着的火。</p>
<p>「你說話，我揍你……加」鬼子吼着。</p>
<p>這傢伙也許沒看見我們引火？也許他想不到地上全是汽油？這傢伙一面吼着，一面逼近了我們兩步，一雙眼睛在地上找着火似的。同時對那浸漫全片地面的汽油，好像欣賞酒香似的，张开了鼻孔嗅着。這裏要借用一句舊小說的熟詞句：「說時遲，那時快」！那傢伙一分神看地上的火的那一剎那間—也許只有十分之一秒工夫，虎弟嚷着，「小姨站開」！人已經就地一個搶臂觔斗，有臂斜插下地，一翻一滾，塌地捲過丈來遠地面，到了那傢伙跟前。那傢伙看見虎弟突如其來這一下，大約吃了驚，正要把槍口逼正，虎弟早已順着那連翻帶滾的勢子，雙腿一挺，突地跳了起來，飛起一脚，踢在那傢伙左手肘上，那手提機槍，已經震得往開一蕩，脫了左手，正在這一剎，虎的左手橫着向外一掃，那集槍早已飛了開去。</p>
<p>「嗯」！日人馳名的鼻音也急出來了。中國話大槪也急得丟了，嘴裏暴聲暴氣，咭咭哇哇地咆吼着，料想是在罵人。他這「嗯」的一聲，似乎還未完全離開鼻孔，虎弟何等矯捷，早已跳起來，（因那傢伙比虎弟高了一個頭），左手一揚虎罩，一個虛晃，一落身勢，右手比閃電還快，由下望上一個斜插，正插在那傢伙軟肋上，翻手一絞一振。照虎弟練過的搶拿手和陰陽當來說，這傢伙，任是他身個高大壯實，一部分內臟早已燬了。</p>

<h3>覆高爾德先生</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>美國人站在美國人的立場，這並不錯誤；中國人站在中國人的立場，同樣這也不是錯誤。錯誤的是以美國立場損害到中國，以由國立場損害到美國，我這所謂損害，是指國際間的正當的邦交和合作而言。你在中國工作的時間很久，你熟悉我們，這說明你對我們有感情；你是一個報人，從同業的立場來說，我們中是更易於理解的，因此，我們感謝你這封申述意見的來信。</p>
<p>近一年來，中美間的公私關係，無可諱言地，較諸比肩作戰時期顯得不夠密切，原因自然很多，但我們總認爲許多偏狹的觀念，以小我利害作前提，再加上別的企圖者的推波助瀾的造謠，誇張，令這種形勢形成格外嚴重而緊張，這是你，爲了向好的方面，爲了消除許多誤會而促進中美眞正友誼的你，高爾德先生，以及我，特有同樣願望以及願作同樣努力的我，所感到十分不安與非常遺憾的。</p>
<p>在這種情況下，將特別感到我們報人責任的重大。我們中國有句古語：「友直，友諒，友多聞」。我們立言報道，直，諒，與多聞，其實也是很好的圭臬。其次談到自由表達坦白討論，我認爲倘越出善意的範圍，其結果恐怕將很難「帮助大家感情改善」的。而且，所表達的，所討論的，倘使完全着眼於不愉快方面，也未免失卻公正。這一點，不知你同意否？</p>
<p>至於你所感到的那個「當前的眞實的問題」，我想威爾基先生的那本「天下一家」可以帮助你獲得解答。地域，國籍，種族，不應談阻止人類共同努力來完成人類的理想的。而我們，從禮運大同篇到孫中山先生的三民主義，一貫的哲學系統，是服膺於這個理想的。</p>

<h3>性的適應</h3>
<p>— 徐榮</p>
<p>（按：如果對於性的問題不懷幼推的神秘感，不懷着「性即犯罪」感，那麼這一篇文章所談的性的實際間題，該是很嚴重的文字，讀者必能以開明而正常的心理來讀完它！）</p>
<p>美國羅星琪家庭關係研究所主任普太諾氏（Paul　Popenoe）是當代倆性問題的權威。最近對於「性的適應」（Sexual　adjustment）發表相當精闢的議論，足資一般迷惑於性的神秘的青年作一南針。他反對「試騐結婚」（Trial　marriage）的謬論，他以爲性的適應並非純粹生理問題，而是能夠由兩性互相諒解亙相合作而達到美滿的結果的。</p>
<p>試騐有一位年靑的女速記員，最近寫了一封信給普本諾氏，說她最近一年來和一個青年很要好，打算要和他結婚。但是他是有條件的向她求婚的。他說：對於結婚最重要的一件事情是在性方面美滿的適應。所以他堅持在結婚之前要設法發現他們兩個在性的方面是否互相適應。如果適應呢，他們就結婚，否則他們應該懸崖勒馬，以免發生悲劇。據他說，這是最科學化的嘗試。那位女主角希望普本諾氏給她一個答覆。下面就是普氏的意見：</p>
<p>錯誤一般人對於結婚上性德適應大多數抱着錯誤的觀念。他們以爲性的適應生來便是註定的。如果適應，則婚姻生活自然會美滿，否則祇有山於離婚一途。他們錯誤即在於以爲：性的適應是完全根據生理上的情形而決定，而其實大謬不然。性的不適應實在是心理上的因素所使然，而生理土的缺陷卻是並無特別重要的。</p>
<p>所調試騐結婚的理論完全忽略了：在任何結婚的初時，性的適應通常總是不美滿的，爲了神經緊張的緣故。</p>
<p>普氏曾經研究過一千個受過敎育的結婚歸女，其中竟然有二百五十個說在結婚初時對於首次性的經騐，覺科嫌惡。研究結果發現：祇有百分之五十一對於首次的經騐表示滿意，百分之四十的表示「尚能忍受，」而其餘則表示痛苦。</p>
<p>妻子需要等相當時間才能獲得完全的滿足。六百五十八個婦女曾經報告過關於這一點的經騐。首次就獲得滿足者百分之二十五，經過數日或數星期後才獲得滿足者百分之二十七，經過一個月或十一個月之後才獲得滿足者百分之二十六，經過一年或更長時間者百分之十六，從未獲得滿足者百分之六。</p>
<p>互信通常而論，性德適應在有利的心理和社會情形之下自然會慢慢地改進起來。這些情形包括互相信任的感情，永久安全的感覺，和不受恐怖威脅的自由。</p>
<p>顯然的，性的適應是可以爭取的，而並非先天註定的。所以試騐婚姻是不適合現實而必然遭遇許多困難的。譬如，年靑人時常閱讀了一些關於性的書本，那些大多屬於下流的書本描寫一種幻想的美滿的性生活，當他們發現試騐時並不合乎理想的時俟，他們就以爲雙方都不適應了。</p>
<p>過分憂慮，過分緊張，是性的適應上最大的敵人。舉行試騐婚姻之前，男女兩方必然覺得有所憂慮，並且過分緊張，所以結果總是不會美滿的。況且，還有許多困難：環境的不利，匆促，保守秘密，恐怕人家發現，恐怕受孕，女方恐怕對方後來會遺棄她，恐怕對方玩弄她而不準備和她結婚，而且男方很容易判　說雙方在性生活上並不適應。</p>
<p>結論結果便是：養成嚴重的自卑感。男方過分強調試騐的結果，以爲自己不能適應正常的標準。然而實在他並無不正常之處。雙方都得容易互相吹毛求疵，感情用事。這樣即使將來結婚了，也是不會有快樂的結果的。</p>
<p>那麼，怎樣才能獲得結婚上美滿的性的適應呢？他們必須具仃正常的情感和態度。他們必須具有充分性智識並互相諒解。爲了這樣，他們必須受過現實的科學的性教育，而不應　　　病　小說價所寫的幻想故事。他們必須具有　　永久的心理，他們須認清結婚生活是志在「白　齊眉，同諧到老」的。有了這樣健全的態度和心理，他們就用不着担憂性德適應問題了。</p>

<h3>國民證難領</h3>
<p>— 痴墨</p>
<p>說來也是笑話，我家的一個門口裏，同時報的戶口，而此番發下來的國民證申請書卻零零碎碎有的有，無的無，難道現在的保甲機構反而及不上敵偽時期的健全嗎？</p>
<p>我們一甲的甲長，非等閒甲長可比，他是一位「布爾喬亞」，他不欲「招搖」，所以他門口沒有甲長辦公處的招牌，反正有事總要上他衙門去央求他，甲長的官邸是一所現代化的大洋房，堅固的紫銅大門，正是門雖設而常關。</p>
<p>這考究的大門墻壁上，裝有一隻電鈴，我們就斗膽的撳了一下子，隔了好一刻辰光，大門上突然開了一個小窗洞，裏面出現一個謂願警，面孔吃得醉醺醺，兩眼血紅，他操着「石硬」的上海話，「你門啥個事體歡電鈴，」經我們告訴他的來意之後，他板起面孔說，「那能介勿識相，油歇吃飯辰光，嚕嚕嘛嘛，晏歇再來，」砰！一聲嚮小門關上了，這時候已兩點半了，巡捕老爺還在和太太碰杯進午餐，祇怪我們去得太早了些，該死。</p>
<p>四點鐘時我們又去，這位巡捕老爺把我們打量了又打量，還是不放心開大門，對我們盤查得仔細到無以復加，他看見我衣襟上的「證章」。命我除下來，他接去後像考古家研究古玩似的賞鑑了足尤十分鐘，才開門讓我們入內。</p>
<p>甲長說，這申請書因上面發下來不夠，所以用黨派的方法，沒有得到的以後再補　這是毫無辦法的，甲長收畢把兩手一伸，頭一搖，鼻孔襄出氣很重，似有微喟。</p>
<h3>抄襲風氣</h3>
<p>— 聖潔</p>
<p>古今中外，沒有一個人是天生就會寫文章的，後一代的人引用前一代人的文章，參考前一代人的技巧，原不足爲奇，不過這並不是說抄人文章，理所當然。對於他人的文章，不假思索地照抄而投稿，則無異於詐欺取財。</p>
<p>但是，最近有許多投稿者，不能改其劣根性。十三日本部某報副列登載着兩篇文章：「建立奇功的孫立人」與「坐鎭濟南的王耀武」，筆者閱後，殊覺奇怪，因爲本人也曾寫過這兩篇文章，「孫立人」這一篇係筆者卅五年九月卅日在申報自由談發表的，該報刊載時「便入西點擊校攻讀」至「更不敢隨便」，這當中一段刪掉以外，餘原文皆與筆者所作一字不差。至於「王耀武」這一篇，係筆者今年雙十節在自由談發表過的。該報所載全文與筆者所作毫無差別，我認爲這種抄製的方法太笨了！</p>
<p>我並不承認我的文章寫得好，但我不願意被人偷，我也痛恨偷文的風氣，因此揭發如上，希望各報編輯先生當心文騙子！</p>

<h3>無辜的殺人犯　4</h3>
<p>— 許桂庭</p>
<p>「老實說，我自己知道我那條腿所受的傷勢還不太嚴重。可是因爲恐怕他們發覺我還能跳來跳去，所以我一直裝着完全殘廢，睡在地下，一動也不動。後來機會來了，在一天晚上，我出盡九牛二虎之力把木椿弄鬆了，然後把它拉出來當做支撐的木棍。當時，我看見門外的一個日本鬼子正在脫下了鋼盔，略爲休息的時候，一剎那間我跳了兩三步，就跳到那個傢伙的後面，出盡吃奶的力氣把木椿敲到他的頭蓋上，當時因爲用力用得太猛，那木樁像彈簧一樣反彈過來從我的手裏飛出去了。而那個日本鬼子就是這樣魂歸天國了。我捧腹大笑一番，然從東摸西模尋到一班緬甸人。恰巧他們不是親英的就是反日的，所以由他們的幫忙，我就這樣生還了。」</p>
<p>魯遜講完之後，看一看手錶，說：「差不多五點鐘了我講得太多了嗎？你覺得不耐煩嗎？」</p>
<p>「天啊！並不覺得不耐煩。」米恩答，「不過，我以爲這次你講的東西也夠多了。讓我們結束這次的談話罷」</p>
<p>下一次，魯遜非但按時而且比平時早一些來到米恩的診所。米恩正患着頭痛，向魯遜笑一笑道：「你覺得好些嗎？」</p>
<p>「好些嗎！我覺得和以前完全不同了，你的注射藥水確然會變戲法。」</p>
<p>「這是當然的」米恩說，「你從前有許多東西悶在心胸裏，現在一部分廓清了，自然覺得輕鬆得多。那麼，我們繼續談下去罷。」</p>
<p>魯遷聽了這句話，臉龐上的笑容完全消散了，他茫然的問：「繼續下去嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的，我們還要把你悶在心頭裏的其餘東西廓清了，才能罷手。現在我們開始罷。」</p>
<p>「但是，開始什麼呢？」魯遜覺得相當迷惑地笑了一笑，「我覺得我已經完全復原了呢。」</p>
<p>「我還不敢下一斷語」，米恩鎮靜地說，「你似乎好了許多。好到什麼程度，我就不敢說。讓我進一步調查罷」</p>
<p>魯遜立刻臉紅起來，很狼狽地說：「我以爲心理分析家也需要吃飯的罷。」</p>
<p>米恩蹙一蹙眉頭，並未回答什麼。</p>
<p>魯遜忽然間大怒起來，冷酷地說：「好！我想警告你，我連一文錢都沒有，我決不能這樣繼續麻煩你。我覺得很好，所以用不着繼續那些不需要的試驗。」</p>
<p>米恩柔和地答：「你今日來這裏的目的就是想說服我，使我相信你是已經治好了。當我說仍然未能斷定的時候，你就馬上和我吵鬧起來。希望我大發皮氣，那麼，你便可以一走了之。老實說，你心胸裏顯然還有許多不可告人之事，這些東西就是你的煩惱之源。它仍然在那裏作祟，老是不放鬆的釘着你，不許你弄掉它，對不對？」未完）</p>
<h3>週末茶話</h3>
<p>— 劉隨</p>
<p>兩種食糧</p>
<p>據山西陰曲傳米消息，說目前太原市內「毒品之充塞與教科書之奇缺適成反比」。聽說井市在淪陷期中，毒氛遍地，勝利後復員歸來人員，復多染善惡習，最近　因吸食鴉片，煩瑣費時，大部改吸白粉，因爲供求相應，販運毒品者　源源不絕於平晉　上。但是另一方面晉省各縣市的中學教科書及參考書，因交通阻塞，不能運到，學生們苦悶異常，是以教育態度，低落不堪。把這兩件事聯想起來，是在使人担心得很；白粉出產在平津一帶，書籍想來同樣是要由平津供應的；白粉能問關輸運，平安到達，使市面不虞匱乏，而書籍則以「交通阻塞」不能和學生見面，別看學生們程度低，有時也很可能聰明起來的，假使他們在苦悶之餘，覺得飽食終日，太對不起家長，反正運銷白粉工作，旅途並不因難，見獵心喜，便躍身參加販運行列’浩浩蕩蕩，一本萬利；恐那時教師也要看得眼熱，再來急起直追，師生合作，那便如何是好？</p>
<p>幸未言中</p>
<p>四川最近發生過一件極風趣的新聞：渠縣女中較遠寢室內有某女教師的時鐘被竊，遍尋無着。乃求於相士，相士屈指推算，告以在該校校園水池內。該女教師遂飭令全校工友，下水尋找，仍無踪跡，大爲憤激，東猜西疑。惹得全校男女工友惶惶不安，於是全體齊集空地，焚燭賭咒，各表清自，情勢至爲嚴重。照樣子看起來，大槪這位女教師是研究心理學的。失去心愛之物既有不甘，當然就一求於卜卦，再求於賭咒；不過遺憾的是結果好像並未因她心理學的臨床實驗而有若何收穫，祗是鬧成「情勢平爲嚴重」的局面而已。但我們着實替川省教育捏了一把冷汗，因爲果真當時一卜之後在水池內就找着了失物，或是在一咒之后就發現到什麽綫索，那麼女學生們默誌在心。將來相夫教子，舉一反三，渠縣的星卜香燭等業，均將引頸翹待，大喊吾道不孤了！</p>
<p>爲了鈔票</p>
<p>本週內有兩件新聞可以歸併起米作爲茶話之資：一是河北新海縣有陳光起其人。抗戰時投身行伍，轉戰各地，妻劉氏不知在那一年上就和他的令弟合　同居起來，等到今年英雄奏凱歸來，覩狀大怒，於是演出全武行，結果互有死傷。另一則是湖南新會縣有唐朝紀其人者，家裏富有資產，雖有弟兄數人，而皆屢圖獨霸，近日唐以　嫂弟媳請分租榖，一時怒起，斧劈嫂　弟姪四人，事後自知不免，亦以剃刀自割睾丸身死。前者骨肉乖戾，起因不過是劉氏在丈夫走後生活無依；後者禍起蕭牆，也祗由於唐公對鈔票想弄到多多益善；總之其逼於生活和物價者則一。目前像這樣的事實，正恐無時無之，無地無之，縱有感慨，也屬卑之無甚高論，因而姑製標題如上，聊當一哭！</p>

        <h1>1946.11.16</h1>
<h3>The Initial Stage of Constitutionalism Begins: The National Assembly's Opening Ceremony is Completed; A Total of 1,355 Representatives Attend</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from our Nanjing Office, 15th] The first National Assembly since the founding of the Republic of China officially opened on the morning of November 15, 1946. National flags flew throughout the capital city, bathed in sunshine and an atmosphere of harmony and joy. From 9:00 AM, the Guofu Road was filled with traffic and unprecedented liveliness, as National Representatives, government leaders, and foreign envoys arrived one after another. Inside and outside the assembly hall, greetings and laughter filled the air, while the assembly staff and reporters were extremely busy. After the representatives entered the assembly hall, they tore off the 100th section of their registration card and handed it to the registration desk, where they were received by the liaison group staff and invited to take any available seat in the assembly hall downstairs. Government officials and guests such as Yu Youren, Chiang Monlin, and Mr. and Mrs. Kong Xiangxi, more than 30 in total, were successively invited to the upper balcony, sitting in the front row on the right. The diplomatic corps, led by Brazilian Ambassador Hildebrando Accioly, was escorted by Li Jun, Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to the front row on the left of the upper balcony.</p>
<p>The assembly's decorations were solemn and magnificent. From the memorial archways at both ends of Guofu Road to the entrance of the assembly hall, both inside and outside the venue, everything was resplendent and dazzling. The national flags on top of the memorial archway and on the screen wall opposite the main entrance were also raised this morning, fluttering in the wind. Inside the venue, the blue, white, and red silk decorations and patterns were particularly pleasing to the eye. The four large vermilion characters "天下爲公" ("The World is for All") were horizontally displayed above the lintel of the assembly hall's main entrance, while on both sides of the hall's main entrance were the large couplet phrases "以建民國" ("To Build the Republic") and "以進大同" ("To Advance to the Great Harmony"). The decorations on the rostrum were especially grand. The backdrop was a purple-red velvet curtain with tassels, and the three walls of the rostrum were decorated with white netting. In the center of the back wall hung a large portrait of the Founding Father of the Nation, adorned with golden national flowers on top and silver ears of grain below, with national flags hanging on the left and right. A row of high-backed chairs was arranged in the central and rear sections, with long desks in front, on which were placed large purple vases filled with chrysanthemums. In front of the desks, one chair was placed on each side, and in the very center was the rostrum, covered with a purple-red velvet carpet. A microphone was placed on it, with recording seats on both sides. In the center of the platform entrance was a staircase, with two cycads at the entrance, and a lectern in front. Both sides were densely lined with madder and blue, white, and red chrysanthemums, with a small cedar tree standing at each corner, and a large national flag, illuminated by strong mercury lights, was dazzlingly luxurious and truly breathtaking.</p>
<p>Wu Jingheng Leads the Oath; Representatives Exceed the Legal Quorum</p>
<p>At 9:50 AM, Mr. Wu Jingheng, the temporary chairman of the assembly, arrived wearing a traditional long gown and mandarin jacket. He was personally welcomed from the car by Mr. Hong Lanyou, and they took a commemorative photo at the entrance of the assembly hall. At 10:00 AM sharp, Chairman Chiang, dressed in military uniform and wearing the Blue Sky White Sun Medal, arrived with his wife and secretaries Hui Shengfen and Zhou Cecong, and went straight to the lounge behind the dining hall for a short rest. Soon after, Madame Chiang also entered the venue, personally registered, and after registering on behalf of the Chairman, took her seat in the first row on the right.</p>
<p>At 10:15 AM, Chairman Chiang and Mr. Wu Jingheng, Hong Lanyou and others entered the rostrum through the side door on the left. First, Mr. Hong announced two matters from the National Assembly Preparatory Committee report: (1) The legal quota for National Assembly representatives was 2,050. Of these, 1,580 were officially announced by the National Government, 1,420 had registered, and 1,355 were in attendance, which exceeded the legal quorum. (2) The National Assembly preparatory meeting had recommended Chairman Chiang as the temporary chairman for the opening ceremony, but Chairman Chiang declined firmly and suggested that the oldest representative should serve. Therefore, Mr. Wu (Jingheng) was invited to take the chairman's seat amidst applause. He announced the opening of the meeting to the sound of music. After the formalities were completed, all the representatives raised their right hands to take the oath, and then Mr. Wu delivered the opening address (details in a separate article).</p>
<p>After Mr. Wu finished his speech, he invited Chairman Chiang of the National Government to speak. At 10:35 AM, the Chairman began by saying, "This National Assembly is an epoch-making event for the Republic of China. Zhongzheng is honored to be the Chairman of the National Government, so I have come to offer my congratulations." He then read out the full text of his speech (see separate article). At 10:55 AM, after the speech, all the representatives stood at attention to pay their respects to the Chairman. At 10:58 AM, Chairman Chiang and Old Man Wu withdrew together to the sound of music, and the opening ceremony was declared complete. China's constitutional era had thus begun.</p>
<h3>Mr. Wu Jingheng's Opening Speech: Hoping for the Constitution to be Created Through Concession and Consultation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The following is the full text of the opening speech delivered by Mr. Wu Jingheng, Chairman of the National Assembly opening ceremony on the morning of the 15th:</p>
<p>Chairman of the National Government, esteemed representatives, today is the happiest day for the people of the Republic of China, because we are opening an epoch-making assembly. This epoch-making assembly is the first National Representative Assembly of the Republic of China. This first National Representative Assembly was established by the Founding Father of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, in the Outline of National Reconstruction. It is an assembly to complete absolute democracy and return power to the people. In recent years, all parties and factions in the country have urged and helped this assembly to be held. Now that it has been opened, it is enough to comfort their democratic aspirations. In particular, the national public has long hoped for the return of power as outlined in the Outline of National Reconstruction. The Founding Father of the Nation instructed his party members early on that the Kuomintang must take on this obligation and prepare to initiate it. Therefore, the Kuomintang has been conscientious and dedicated, constantly discussing the opening of this assembly. Since 1936, the procedures for convening it have been implemented, and regional representatives have been carefully elected. Suitable dates have been repeatedly set, but resistance and other factors have always been blocked by the current situation. Today, this assembly has finally been realized and gathered in one hall to open. The spirit of the Founding Father of the Nation in heaven must be very pleased. This is the first point, which is deeply gratifying.</p>
<p>The Founding Father of the Nation instructed the Kuomintang to exercise tutelage. The work of tutelage was originally extremely difficult, and this year is the 35th year of the Republic of China. In the fifteen years before the 16th year of the Republic of China, there was no talk of any tutelage. The Kuomintang was displaced and migrated, and the Founding Father had to reorganize his party. In the ten years from the 16th year to the 25th year, the first four or five years were met with civil wars in Jiangxi and Hubei. Even the strength for resistance in the future was lost in those few years. When the September 18th Incident of the 20th year came one after another, and from the 26th year to the present, we entered the period of resistance. Can a tutelage that exists in name only be allowed to continue? Therefore, in the 25th year, the Kuomintang yearned for the National Assembly to be opened, returning this empty name of tutelage. Moreover, according to the Founding Father's tutelage, we must learn from Yi Yin tutoring Tai Jia and the Duke of Zhou tutoring King Cheng. How easy is that? The only obligation of his party members is to make the whole country understand that the China created by him, the Republic of China, cannot do without the Three Principles of the People. We have been discussing the drafting of a constitution, and until recently, through consultations, the people of the whole country and all parties and factions recognized that the Republic of China is a republic based on the Three Principles of the People. Then, the most important goal has been achieved, relying on the joint tutelage of the people of the whole country and all parties and factions. What is the point of bearing this empty name? It is a small matter to lose the party's reputation, but it would be a great mistake for the country. Shouldn't we return power early? There are still many healthy members of the Kuomintang. If we do not allow them to follow all parties and factions to consult together in the constitutional era, consulting together to serve the people, what is the point of not opening this assembly and bearing this empty name? Today, the assembly has finally opened. This is the second point, a happy and justified joy.</p>
<p>The assembly is opened, and we obtain the most progressive constitution to back up the people. Then, the peace and happiness that we are all seeking can be fully achieved. However, Confucius said, "If one can govern the state with propriety and deference, what difficulty will there be?" Not only does the state need propriety and deference, but maintaining the peace and tranquility of the whole world also depends entirely on tolerance. In the past, ambitious people came out to cause trouble. Fortunately, Mr. Stalin of the Soviet Union took the lead in advocating tolerance, liberating the Third International and curbing the blind and chaotic source of the Trotskyites. Following this, President Roosevelt of the United States also used the greatest tolerance to advise Hitler, saying, "You say that our democratic politics are backward, but we do not admit that we are backward. However, we practice our democratic politics, and you can practice your Nazism." Hitler did not listen, and therefore the US Secretary of State also advised others that the world is very big and can accommodate different ideologies. President Truman also said that the unrest in the world is due to the differences in political philosophies. I think the world is not only very big, but also very long. Political philosophies are often too profound. Scholars who are highly educated do not care, but the general public is so surprised that they are unwilling to be tolerant, which leads to unrest in the world and disappointment in peace. Therefore, from now on, we should all use tolerance and endless consultation, and we will be able to achieve prosperity in our constitutional era. All parties and factions can come to the meeting based on the spirit of consultation, and help to create the most progressive constitution. This is the third point. I hope that tolerance can play a role. I would like to contribute these three points for your reference.</p>

<h3>The Chairman Urges Representatives to Complete the Task of Constitution-Making to Lay the Foundation for Democracy and the Rule of Law</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The following is the full text of Chairman Chiang's speech at the opening ceremony of the National Assembly today (15th):</p>
<p>Esteemed Representatives,</p>
<p>Today, the National Assembly is holding its opening ceremony. The representatives, entrusted with the heavy responsibility of the people, have gathered in the capital to participate in the great cause of drafting the Constitution of the Republic of China. This is the beginning of China's entry into the era of democratic constitutionalism, and it is also the most solemn and grand gathering in the history of the founding of the Republic of China. Zhongzheng represents the National Government in extending a warm welcome to all of you, and expresses his sincere respect to the Assembly.</p>
<p>Inheriting the Legacy of the Founding Father, Completing the Goal of Nation-Building</p>
<p>Looking back at the purpose of the National Revolution advocated by the Founding Father, which was to revive China, establish the Republic, and implement the Three Principles of the People, so that China would be a rich, strong, healthy, and happy country owned, governed, and enjoyed by the people. The Xinhai Revolution destroyed the monarchy that had lasted for more than 4,000 years and overthrew the Manchu Qing autocracy that had lasted for more than 200 years. The Founding Father once discussed the significance of this battle, saying, "Since this battle, democratic politics in China has been recognized by the people." However, after the establishment of the Republic, the foundation was not solid, the principles were not implemented, warlords stole the country, and the chaos was endless. External aggression was frequent, and the country was in danger. Our Founding Father again led the comrades to continue the struggle, taking risks and overcoming difficulties, and continuing their efforts. His firm will clearly told the people of the whole country, first, "China is suitable for democracy," and second, "We must not pursue the name of the Republic, but pursue the reality of sovereignty in the people." The essence of the Founding Father's Principle of Democracy lies in giving the people power, that is, to enable all the people to manage the politics of the people. The establishment of the Outline of National Reconstruction clearly defined the steps of the revolutionary strategy, from military administration to tutelage and then to the constitutional era, which was to consolidate the foundation of democracy and provide a strong guarantee for the Republic. The National Government inherited the legacy of the Founding Father, so after the completion of the Northern Expedition in 1928, it actively began tutelage, and took the implementation of constitutionalism and the completion of nation-building as the greatest goal.</p>
<p>Regarding the preparations for the implementation of constitutionalism and the convening of the National Assembly, the responsible authorities have reported the detailed process separately. The National Government promulgated the draft constitution in May 1936, followed by the promulgation of the National Assembly Organization Law and the Election Law. The election of representatives to the National Assembly began throughout the country. Before the War of Resistance, the government had originally decided to convene the National Assembly on November 12, 1937 to enact the Constitution. At that time, the election of representatives from various regions was about to be completed, but Japan intensified its aggression and launched the July 7th Incident. In order to defend the survival of the nation, the government called on the whole country to engage in the sacred War of Resistance. Since then, the military situation has been tense, and the convening of the National Assembly has actually been difficult. However, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee in 1939 still resolved to convene the National Assembly in November 1940, but it was eventually postponed due to the expansion of the war and the many colleagues in the Political Participation Council who advocated for a postponement. By the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee in 1943, it was resolved that "the date of the National Assembly must have a clear provision, and the National Assembly shall be convened within one year after the end of the war." However, Zhongzheng personally believes that the War of Resistance and nation-building should be completed in one battle, and the National Assembly can be convened as soon as possible, so that China's fundamental law can be formulated as soon as possible, and the National Government can realize its long-cherished wish to return power to the people as soon as possible. Therefore, at the Sixth National Congress of the Kuomintang in 1945, it was proposed to hold the National Assembly on November 12 of the same year, the 80th birthday of the Founding Father, which was approved by the Congress, and the preparations were actively launched. At that time, the idea was that the implementation of constitutionalism based on the Three Principles of the People was the greatest wish of the Founding Father's life, and the Founding Father's non-occupancy of merit in the first year of the Republic and the consistent struggle since then were all for the welfare and freedom of the country and the people. Therefore, we compatriots throughout the country want to commemorate the Founding Father, and we can only commemorate our teacher of revolution and nation-building by convening the National Assembly and enacting the Constitution. Today, our National Assembly has been convened one year after the scheduled period. Before the portrait of the great man who founded the country, we will remember the difficult struggle of our country's democratic politics, and we will surely have endless feelings of admiration and remembrance.</p>
<p>The Government is Tolerant and Harmonious, Upholding the Resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference</p>
<p>Since Japan's surrender last year, the external troubles that hindered our country's unification and democracy have been fundamentally eliminated, but there are still great difficulties in the domestic situation. The actions of armed parties have affected the peace and stability of the country, and differences in political opinions are enough to disperse the strength of post-war nation-building. The National Government deeply feels that after the country has been greatly destroyed by the eight-year War of Resistance, it must immediately carry out extraordinary construction, and the national construction must be carried out smoothly, and there must be a united and sincere effort from the whole country. Therefore, the Political Consultative Conference was convened in January this year, bringing together representatives of various parties and factions and social elites to discuss the grand plan of peace and nation-building. The 20-day meeting produced five agreements on political and military affairs, including the proposal of the five-five constitution single amendment principle, the expansion of the number of representatives to the National Assembly, and the confirmation of May 5 of this year as the date for convening the National Assembly. In these agreements, the National Government has always taken the spirit of serving the country and the people, and taken into consideration the unbearable suffering of compatriots after the war and the impossibility of delaying the great plan of nation-building, and has always adopted a tolerant and harmonious attitude, agreeing to the establishment of various agreements. After the closing of the Political Consultative Conference, it faithfully abided by the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and implemented them in order. The National Assembly Organization Law was also revised in accordance with the agreement. During this period, there were many twists and turns, which resulted in the failure to convene the meeting as scheduled on May 5, and the National Assembly that our country has been looking forward to can only be held today. For the representatives, especially the representatives who have come from afar to Beijing and have been stranded for many days, it is necessary to report the progress.</p>
<p>Balancing Ideal and Reality for the Long-Term Peace and Stability of the Country</p>
<p>The representatives who have come to the meeting today come from various provinces, cities and regions, and some have come back to the motherland from overseas to participate. The representatives represent regions or professions, have rich political experience, and have outstanding reputations in society. The nature of their production is different, and the earnest expectation that our country will realize democracy, unity, and progress is the same for everyone. In particular, those from the Northeast, which has been occupied for 14 years, and from Taiwan, which has recently been recovered, their love for the motherland and their willingness to contribute to the country must be particularly eager. I believe that you will deeply understand the famous sayings of the Founding Father, "The foundation of the country lies in the people" and "Hundreds of millions of people are tighter than the country," and clearly understand the relationship between the country and the people and the responsibility of the people to the country, and perform your constitution-making tasks according to law, and open a good start for China's constitutional government. We know that the Constitution is the fundamental law of the country, which cannot be compared with ordinary laws and regulations. The Constitution is the code of conduct for the whole country. On the one hand, it must have far-reaching ideals, and on the other hand, it must take into account the actual situation of the country. Our ideal is the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution left by the Founding Father, and the reality of our country is that the country and society have undergone long-term evolution and progress since the War of Resistance. Only a constitution that balances ideal and reality is a constitution that is suitable for the national conditions and is perfect and feasible, and it can plan for the long-term peace and stability of the country and seek true happiness for the compatriots. If we can concentrate our efforts and formulate a perfect and feasible constitution, and lay the foundation for democracy and the rule of law, then the public opinion of all regions, classes, and professions in the country, as well as the opinions of all political parties, can be expressed in accordance with the legal track.</p>
<p>Returning Power to the People of the Whole Country to Establish a Century-Old Foundation</p>
<p>In the future, all problems can be appealed to the public will of the whole people according to law for decision, and then our country will have a truly independent, free, unified, and democratic foundation, and then our compatriots can exercise true civil rights and fulfill their national obligations to promote the prosperity and progress of the country.</p>
<p>Zhongzheng followed the Founding Father and devoted himself to the revolution. He always took the construction of China as an independent, free, unified, and democratic country as his life's ambition. The main purpose of the eight-year War of Resistance in the past was to eliminate the invasion of violence and seek China's independence and freedom. Thanks to the efforts of our compatriots and all the soldiers, we finally achieved the final victory, and in the middle of the War of Resistance, we realized the Founding Father's legacy of abolishing inequality and concluding new, equal, and friendly treaties with the United Nations such as Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. However, looking back on my life, I still feel that it is a great regret that we have not promulgated a constitution and implemented constitutionalism since the September 18th Incident. My hope for ending tutelage, implementing constitutionalism, and completing the great cause of nation-building has not been forgotten for a moment in these 30 years. Our struggle for revolution and nation-building is for the country and the people, and it is to implement the democratic politics of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution. This is the ultimate goal of our revolution. If this ultimate goal cannot be achieved for a day, it means that the legacy of our Founding Father has not been achieved for a day, and it also means that we have not fulfilled our responsibility to the country, the people, and the revolutionary martyrs of the past 50 years. I want to especially sincerely tell you that the Kuomintang of China was entrusted by the National Assembly in 1931 to exercise political power. The National Government exercised its governing power based on the laws of the tutelage period. In these more than ten years, there has not been a day when it has not been conscientious and dedicated, as if a heavy burden is on its shoulders. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, it is fortunate that it has not failed the trust of the people. The only thing that is hoped is to promulgate the Constitution and implement constitutionalism as soon as possible, return power to the people of the whole country, and establish a foundation for the Republic that will not be shaken for a hundred years, and this sacred and solemn constitution-making task will be jointly shouldered by our representatives.</p>
<p>Esteemed Representatives, our National Assembly this time can be said to have been opened after countless difficulties and thousands of twists and turns. We remember the hardships of the Founding Father's leadership of the revolution and the successive struggles of the revolutionary martyrs. Our representatives must ensure that this conference does not fail the legacy of the Founding Father and the revolutionary martyrs. We recall the past, suffering from the obstruction of enemy aggression, which delayed our great cause of nation-building. Our representatives must also do their best to complete this sacred task in order to comfort the souls of the soldiers and civilians who sacrificed for the country in the eight-year War of Resistance. At the same time, we think of the political unrest and the suffering of the people today, which are all caused by the failure to establish the foundation of the country. This time, the drafting of the Constitution is a plan to stabilize the foundation of the country and realize the rule of constitutional government. The mission of our representatives is even more solemn and important. Zhongzheng is honored to participate in today's grand meeting. I sincerely pray that all representatives will work hard for the country and wish the conference success. (End)</p>

<h3>Sidelights of the Assembly</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent</p>
<p>The opening ceremony began at ten o'clock in the morning. Early in the morning, the streets of Nanjing were still deserted with few pedestrians, but the cars on Guofu Road were already coming and going in an endless stream, and the news reporters had been mobilized.</p>
<p>Representatives Gracious and Courteous</p>
<p>The main entrance of the assembly hall, with its vermilion-lacquered large round pillars, the brilliant national flags, and the blue sky, contrasted sharply and stood out. The gold badges and vermilion sashes of the representatives glittered brilliantly in the sunlight. Everyone was smiling, gracious, and courteous. This was a grand gathering of the nation's young talents, and Chinese history was unfolding a new page today.</p>
<p>Inside the assembly hall, three rows of blooming blue, white, and red chrysanthemums were arranged on the left and right sides of the rostrum. Secretary-General Hong, in a blue robe and black mandarin jacket, directed the proceedings. Around half-past nine, the representatives began to enter the hall one after another. The seats for foreign envoys, guests, and government leaders were upstairs, and the most eye-catching, of course, was President Yu, with his silver beard fluttering. As the opening ceremony began, Ambassador Stuart lowered his head as if deep in thought.</p>
<p>Venerable Elder beaming</p>
<p>Elder Wu arrived early as well. Today, he truly looked like the officiant at a wedding ceremony, appearing even more prosperous than when he was in Shanghai. Dressed in a blue satin cotton robe and black silk mandarin jacket, he entered the hall with a beaming smile, greeting acquaintances with warm words.</p>
<p>At ten minutes past ten, the chairman walked onto the rostrum amidst enthusiastic applause. Today, the chairman was wearing a yellow ceremonial uniform and white gloves, his steps were nimble, and he was solemn and resolute.</p>
<p>Before the official start of the opening ceremony, Secretary-General Hong, who had spent countless efforts preparing for the National Assembly, reported that the number of National Assembly representatives was two thousand and fifty. The government had officially announced the names of one thousand five hundred and eighty. As of ten o'clock in the morning of the fifteenth, one thousand four hundred and twenty had registered, and one thousand three hundred and fifty-five were present today. Previously, the representatives had expressed in discussions that they would not invite the Chairman of the National Government to be the Chairman of the Assembly, but the Chairman requested to resign. Therefore, the representative with the highest seniority was chosen as the Chairman of the Assembly, and Representative Wu Jingheng was the most senior. When Elder Wu's name was mentioned, the representatives applauded thunderously. Thus, Elder Wu took the chairman's seat, and the opening ceremony officially began.</p>
<p>Various Oath-Taking Postures</p>
<p>When Elder Wu led the representatives in taking the oath, each representative raised their right hand, many with clenched fists, their postures both firm and gentle, which was quite beautiful and impressive. When reciting the oath, some spoke in Mandarin, some in Cantonese, and some in Hokkien. The scene in the hall was like a tide rushing against rocks, and the expressions of the representatives were all very devout.</p>
<p>After Elder Wu delivered his address, he invited Chairman Chiang to speak, and the entire audience listened with bated breath. At this time, the photographers were the busiest, with one American photographer taking more than a dozen shots in a row. When Elder Wu was speaking, a photographer's flashbulb exploded, causing a stir throughout the hall.</p>
<p>There were many mercury lamps on both sides of the hall. China Electric was filming this great moment, and soon, compatriots across the country would be able to see how solemn this grand ceremony was.</p>
<p>Standing Up to Pay Respects</p>
<p>After Chairman Chiang finished his speech, all the representatives put forward a temporary motion to stand up and pay respects to Chairman Chiang for his hard work and great achievements. Immediately, all the representatives stood up in solemnity, and Chairman Chiang also stood up to return the salute. At this moment, the ceremony concluded amidst music, and the representatives also left the hall one after another. They went outside and handed the signed and stamped oath papers to the female staff in two counters outside the hall. Many representatives crowded in front of the temporary post office to buy commemorative stamps. President Sun stood on the stairs and spoke with Secretary-General Shao for a moment, as if waiting for something, but in the blink of an eye, he left again.</p>
<p>Reporters Surround Elder Wu</p>
<p>At the entrance of the assembly hall, Elder Wu was surrounded by some reporters who requested his autograph, making it almost impossible for him to move. It was not until the security personnel arrived that he was freed. The wireless loudspeakers were instructing the representatives on how to board the National Assembly transportation vehicles specially assigned to pick up and drop off the representatives. In addition, the representatives' cars and jeeps, with five-pointed stars and long strips of paper as entry and exit passes, also departed one after another. The assembly hall became quiet again.</p>
<p>Today's opening ceremony started at fifteen minutes past ten and ended at fifty minutes past ten. I asked many representatives, "When will the preparatory meeting be held?" Their answers were almost unanimously, "We are waiting to see the news in the papers, we still need you to tell us."</p>

<h3>Resolutely Submitting the List of Representatives The Youth Party Participates in the National Assembly Mr. Zuo Shunsheng Issues a Statement on the Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The Youth Party's list of participants in the National Assembly was submitted on the 15th. At 8:00 PM, the National Assembly's Continued Selection of Representatives Committee held a meeting in the National Government Auditorium, attended by Wu Fengchang, Chen Lifu, Zhang Lisheng, Yu Youren, and Jia Jingde, presided over by Wu Jingheng, to discuss and approve the Youth Party's list, which will be announced tonight.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The Youth Party resolutely participated in the National Assembly, and the list has also been submitted. This reporter specifically approached the party's Minister of Propaganda, Mr. Zuo Shunsheng, to inquire about the party's decision to participate and the reasons. Mr. Zuo issued the following statement on the situation: "Since the 21st of last month, individuals from the Third Force, invited by the government, came to Nanjing together. After more than twenty days of running around and discussing, there have been many moving facts. Although the crux of the problem is generally clear, there are still some disagreements between the government and the Chinese Communist Party that cannot be resolved. Even within the Third Force itself, there are differences in opinions. Until 8:00 PM on the 11th of this month, on the eve of the originally scheduled opening of the National Assembly, no unanimous agreement could be reached. Our party and some social elites then decided to indicate that they could nominate a list, but still hoped that the government would postpone the opening date by a few days for a final effort. This is the reason why the opening date of the National Assembly was postponed by three days. Unfortunately, during these final three days, the Democratic League made a resolution not to participate temporarily, and the Chinese Communist Party strongly advocated for the cessation of the assembly. In order to promote the implementation of democratic constitutionalism, and to act in concert with some social elites, and even more unwilling to cause excessive disappointment to the people of the whole country who are increasingly mired in deep water and scorching fire, we resolutely submitted the list of our party's representatives. Tracing back to several years ago, we have spared no effort in mediating and working for national unity. The purposes we have cherished are: first, to strive for peace; second, to promote unity; and third, to realize democracy. This is not only something that all parties in the government and opposition agree on without any dissent, but also something that the people of the whole country are eagerly expecting. The difference is that some people believe that participating in the National Assembly will undermine peace, while we believe that since the cessation of hostilities has already been implemented, only by unanimously participating in the National Assembly can there be hope for continued maintenance of peace. Some people believe that participating in the National Assembly will lead to division, while we believe that division has been a de facto reality for several years, and only by unanimously participating in the National Assembly can there be a possibility of promoting national unity. Some people believe that participating in the National Assembly will hinder democracy, while we believe that only by passing the revised draft constitution of the Political Consultative Conference in this National Assembly, and obtaining the support of the entire country, can democracy obtain a powerful guarantee. The completion of these several major goals is truly the fundamental position of our party since its founding. As for how the date of the National Assembly was decided today, and whether the reorganization of the National Government and the Executive Yuan occurred before the opening of the National Assembly or a few days later, it is indeed related to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, but compared to the larger and more distant goals listed above, it is still secondary. I dare to announce these intentions to the people of the country. Merit or demerit, right or wrong, opinions will vary, and everything can only be left to the fair judgment of contemporary heroes and future historians."</p>

<h3>Nanyang Siang Pau Publishes Editorial Urging the Communist Party to Come to Their Senses</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore, 15th] Today, the Nanyang Siang Pau here published an editorial on the opening of the National Assembly, making a final appeal to the Chinese Communist Party. The newspaper stated: Today is an important beginning for the Chinese Communist Party, and it is earnestly hoped that its leaders will come to their senses, hand over their troops, and participate in the National Assembly. If the Chinese Communist Party believes that after a formal military defeat, it can carry out guerrilla warfare, it is truly foolish. This kind of tactic is purely destructive and does not benefit the goals of the Communist Party at all, only increasing the suffering of the general population.</p>
<h3>Zhou Enlai's Departure Date Uncertain The Communist Party Indicates There is Still Room for Negotiation Democratic League Personages Will Make a Final Effort</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The peace talks have entered another stage. Today, apart from the New China Daily office, which did not hang the national flag, all shops and government agencies in the capital hung flags to celebrate. Tonight, this reporter went to the Democratic League office to inquire about their attitude after the convening of the National Assembly. According to Zhang Shenfu: Although the Democratic League will not participate in the National Assembly, it still does not give up hope for peaceful mediation and will wait and see. Apart from Shen Junru, who will go to Shanghai on the morning of the 16th, the rest of the Democratic League personages will remain in Nanjing and make a final effort. The Communist Party's press conference, originally scheduled for the 15th, has now been changed to 4:00 PM on the 16th.

<h3>The Executive Yuan Reiterates Previous Order Strictly Enforcing the Habeas Corpus Law</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The Executive Yuan previously issued an order stipulating that the Habeas Corpus Law would be implemented from March 15th of this year. Now, the Executive Yuan's office has learned that since the implementation of the law, some agencies executing arrests and detentions in various regions are still outwardly complying but inwardly disobeying. In order to strictly enforce the Habeas Corpus Law, respect personal freedom, and prevent unlawful infringement, a further circular is issued to all levels of government. Whenever a person is illegally arrested or detained by any agency other than a court, the executing agency should immediately, in accordance with the provisions of the Habeas Corpus Law, inform the person and their close relatives of the reasons for the arrest or detention within 24 hours. Furthermore, the executing agency should, after receiving a notice or writ of habeas corpus from the court, respond according to the schedule or deliver the arrested or detained person within 24 hours. Those who intentionally obstruct will be punished according to law. The courts receiving applications should also fulfill their duties and not delay or perfunctorily handle the matter, so as not to lose the public's trust in the law.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Returned to the Country Yesterday Arriving in Shanghai He Took a Train to Nanjing at 11:00 PM That Night He Met with Truman and Eisenhower in the United States</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, along with his wife, Dr. Dong Bingqi, and Secretary Liu Yuye, returned to the country from Tokyo on American military aircraft C45 number 5584 the night before yesterday, arriving safely at Jiangwan Airport in this city at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. Those who went to welcome him included Mayor Wu Guozhen, former Mayor Qian Dajun, Secretary-General of the City Party Headquarters Xie Renzhao, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai Chen Guokang, Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng representing Sun Qinchi, Deputy Secretary-General of the Central Planning Bureau He Qian, Tianjin Mayor Du Jianshi, Director-General of the National Government's Budget Bureau Xu Kan representing Ye Xinmin, Chief of the City Government's Public Relations Section Zhang Bide, Zhang's eldest son Ji Zheng, and more than 40 of his friends and reporters from various newspapers. The 146th Brigade of the Army also sent an honor guard to the airport to welcome him. At 9:10 AM, when the aircraft door opened, Mayor Wu was the first to board the plane and, after exchanging brief greetings with Zhang, they disembarked together to the sound of military music and accepted flowers from relatives and friends. Zhang was smiling and full of energy, wearing a dark green suit with a light gray overcoat. He then shook hands and thanked each of the welcomers and, at the request of reporters, made a short statement in the airport reception room. Zhang first said: "I went abroad on September 10th for treatment of poisonous cancer, arriving in Washington on the 14th and transferring to a New York hospital. After being hospitalized for 25 days and undergoing five operations, I was finally cured. I originally intended to investigate construction projects in the United States, but I was unable to do so due to a telegram from the government. However, I did go to Canada once to inspect water conservancy projects, so that I could learn from them after returning to the country. At the same time, the Canadian Prime Minister was very interested in the water conservancy projects in Sichuan Province of our country and expressed his willingness to provide assistance. During my time in the United States, I was deeply grateful for the concern of friends in that country for my health." Zhang also said: "In the United States, I met with President Truman and had frank discussions on everything. I also met with General Eisenhower at the Department of Defense. The United States' policy towards China will not change." Zhang said that he had not heard of the rumors about him being appointed as the head of the Executive Yuan. Zhang continued: "I have been abroad for almost two months and am quite unfamiliar with the situation in the country." Finally, Zhang mentioned that the American zoos highly value our country's precious animal, the panda. The previous panda had grown large and weighed over 300 pounds. American friends were very sorry to hear about the death of the panda in Shanghai this autumn and still hope to send another one next year. In addition, the United States and San Diego are also requesting pandas, which shows that this animal is quite reputable internationally." He was then escorted by Mayor Wu to his private residence on Shaanxi South Road and took a train to Nanjing at 11:00 PM that night.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Expectations for the National Assembly Representatives</h3>
<p>— After reading Chairman Chiang's Speech</p>
<p>The National Assembly, watched by the world and anticipated by the nation, has finally opened yesterday morning after countless twists and turns. This is the most important day in the history of the Republic of China, and it marks the beginning of our country's political transition towards constitutionalism. All people who yearn for peace and seek democracy are expressing joy and rejoicing at the opening of this National Assembly, harboring full of hope; everyone hopes that this National Assembly can formulate a practical and feasible democratic constitution, laying a solid foundation for the country's long-term plan. After listening to the speech delivered by Chiang at the opening ceremony of the National Assembly, we are even more convinced of the importance of the National Assembly's responsibility, and we believe that it will achieve satisfactory results, but in this historic opening ceremony of the National Assembly, our common people did not see the participation of the CCP, which cannot but be disappointing and regrettable.</p>
<p>In the current China, what is urgently needed is peace, democracy, and unity; but how to achieve peaceful, unified democracy? The only way is to embark on the right track of constitutionalism. Therefore, convening the National Assembly to formulate a constitution is indeed what the people of the whole country have been longing for day and night, and it is also the most urgent political task at present. Except for those with ulterior motives, there is absolutely no reason to oppose it. The CCP's refusal to participate in the National Assembly and its further expressions, attempting to put the country in a state of division, only show its futility and will never win the sympathy of the people. It has no impact whatsoever on the convening of the National Assembly and the completion of its sacred task of constitution-making. As for the Democratic League's willingness to echo the CCP's claims, it not only loses its original position but will also be despised by the people. Fortunately, the government convened the National Assembly this time, based on its spirit of tolerance, treating the CCP and the Democratic League with sincerity. The repeated postponements of the National Assembly were the government's expression of its constant hope for their participation in the National Assembly. Even after the opening of the National Assembly, their representative seats are still reserved, and they can report and participate at any time. Therefore, we still hope that the Democratic League can put the country first, realize its mistakes, and participate in the National Assembly as soon as possible to complete the great task of constitution-making.</p>
<p>This National Assembly is the first National Assembly of the Republic of China, equivalent to the National Constituent Assembly of France, or the American Constitutional Convention convened after the independence of the United States. Its sole task is to formulate a practical and feasible democratic constitution. Turning through the constitutional history of various countries and tracing the process of constitution-making in our country, it is not difficult to know that constitution-making is indeed a difficult task. The quality of the constitution itself has a very close relationship with the future of the country. As the saying goes, "a bad constitution is worse than no constitution"; at the same time, the success or failure of constitution-making is the key to the country's rise and fall. The constitution to be formulated by this National Assembly not only requires the realization of democracy, but also this constitution concerns peace and unity. The responsibility borne by the representatives of the National Assembly is indeed too great. In his speech at the opening of the National Assembly, Chairman Chiang earnestly warned all the representatives, saying: "I hope that when the representatives create the constitution, everyone can cooperate wholeheartedly, accommodate opinions from all parties, and establish a perfect and feasible constitution."</p>
<p>What is a constitution? It is the fundamental law of the country, which concerns the foundation of the country. As Chairman Chiang said: "The constitution is the fundamental law of the country, a code to be followed by the whole country. On the one hand, it must have far-reaching ideals; on the other hand, it must take into account the actual situation of the country." In today's democratic era, the people are the main body of the country. Of course, everyone has requirements and opinions on the ideals of the fundamental law and the actual situation of the country. Therefore, it is not an unexpected phenomenon that complex opinions are formed on the nature and spirit of the constitution, but it is inevitable in any country. Taking the United States as an example, when the United States convened the Constitutional Convention in 1787, the American people also had complex opinions on the draft constitution, and the representatives of each state had their own prejudices. Later, thanks to the efforts of American politicians, the Constitutional Convention was finally passed, and it is still the fundamental law of the United States. The unity, prosperity, and strength of the United States rely on this authentic constitution, even though it has never been unanimously considered satisfactory by the people of the whole country. But the US Constitution was created by reconciling national opinions. This historical fact of constitution-making by a friendly country can serve as a model for our country's constitution-making and constitutional implementation today.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the people of our country can all believe in the Three Principles of the People of the Founding Father. Even the CCP and the Democratic League also publicly recognize that they are willing to take the Three Principles of the People as the highest principles of the country. Therefore, the people of the whole country have no disapproval in principle of any constitution drafted in accordance with the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution. There are only minor differences, unlike the people of other countries, who have no standards for the drafting of the constitution. The CCP's opposition to the National Assembly's constitution-making and the Democratic League's refusal to participate are all with ulterior motives. When the National Assembly meets to discuss the constitution this time, not only is there a draft constitution of the Fifth Five-Year Plan drafted by the Legislative Yuan in accordance with the teachings of the Founding Father and promulgated by the National Government, which can be used as a basis for discussion; but also the Several Principles of Amendment to the Draft Constitution proposed by the Political Consultative Conference Comprehensive Group have been drafted by Wang Chonghui and others in accordance with these several principles of amendment, which is a revised draft of the Fifth Five-Year Plan. This draft was drafted by accommodating the opinions of various parties and factions and social figures, and can also be used for comparative research and choice. In terms of the theory of political science, any system has its advantages and disadvantages. There is no absolute standard. The choice of system depends on the wise choice of the representatives of the National Assembly. Taking the central political system as an example, the American-style presidential system and the British and French-style cabinet system have their own advantages and disadvantages in theory. Which system should we adopt after all? We should have a broad vision, face reality, and consider which political system is most suitable for our country's national conditions? Which political system is most practical and feasible? Ten thousand should decide which political system to adopt. Chairman Chiang also gave clear instructions on this level: "Only a constitution that takes into account both ideals and reality is a constitution that is suitable for the national conditions and is perfect and feasible, and can seek long-term peace and stability for the country and real happiness for the compatriots."</p>
<p>In short, the constitution is the fundamental law of the country, concerning the future rise and fall and survival of the country. The National Assembly has the task of making the constitution, and the responsibility of the representatives is really too great. Therefore, we hope that the representatives of the National Assembly must consider carefully and humbly when discussing the constitution, and especially should put aside personal and group prejudices and be able to tolerate the opinions of others. In addition to taking the Three Principles of the People as the fundamental principle of constitution-making, we must also summarize everyone's wisdom and reconcile opinions from all aspects. We must make this Chinese Magna Carta a constitution that can truly represent the people of the whole country. There is a common motto in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad, that is, "be careful in planning the beginning of things." The success or failure of any cause is determined at the beginning. The convening of this National Assembly is the first step for our country to move towards democracy, and we must be especially cautious. Therefore, after the opening of the National Assembly, our common people have to express our deep expectations to all the representatives of the National Assembly, hoping that all the representatives of the National Assembly can shoulder this sacred and solemn task to formulate a practical and feasible democratic constitution for the country, so that our country's politics will embark on the road of peace and democracy, and open a good beginning, so as to promote the prosperity and progress of the country.</p>
<h3>Development of the Trieste Port Issue</h3>
<p>Since the Council of Foreign Ministers meeting in New York on November 4, it has encountered two of the most difficult problems: first, the international navigation of the Danube River, and second, the international co-management of the Trieste port. According to a report from Agence France-Presse in New York on the 13th, the Council of Foreign Ministers has reached a three-point agreement on the Trieste port issue: The decisions of the Paris Peace Conference on the Trieste Free Zone and its status should be maintained. The Council of Foreign Ministers welcomes any agreement that Italy and Yugoslavia may reach through direct negotiations, but on the condition that this agreement does not violate the resolutions of the Paris Peace Conference. The Council of Foreign Ministers will discuss the Trieste port plan proposed by France point by point starting from the 13th of this month.</p>
<p>These three points of agreement seem to be contradictory, because the Council of Foreign Ministers on the one hand allows Italy and Yugoslavia to talk directly, on the other hand, it is discussing the Trieste port plan proposed by France point by point; on the one hand, it welcomes the agreement that Italy and Yugoslavia may reach through direct negotiations, on the other hand, it requires them not to violate the resolutions of the Paris Peace Conference. But from the actual situation, since the Council of Foreign Ministers is meeting, if the Trieste port issue is not resolved, the Italian Peace Treaty will inevitably be delayed. Of course, the Council of Foreign Ministers cannot stop the meeting and wait for the uncertain direct negotiations between Italy and Yugoslavia. In the past, during the Paris Council of Foreign Ministers and the Paris Peace Conference of Twenty-One Nations, the Trieste port issue was the most contentious, almost causing the conference to stall. Fortunately, thanks to France's compromise, the Council of Foreign Ministers and the Paris Peace Conference finally passed it in the afternoon. The current Council of Foreign Ministers should naturally not easily abandon the hard-won resolutions of the Paris Peace Conference and re-ignite international disputes.</p>
<p>The resolutions of the Paris Peace Conference have been agreed to by all countries in principle after being passed by more than two-thirds of the votes. The difficulties in implementation are first due to the stalemate between the people of Italy and Yugoslavia, and second due to the competition between the Soviet Union and the British and American forces. Yugoslavia, in the posture of a victorious country, although it has a smaller population in Trieste, believes that Trieste should be incorporated into its territory. Italy believes that Trieste was originally its own territory and cannot be easily ceded. The two sides refuse to compromise, and riots and bloodshed continue to occur. The emotions of the people are very激ang, and the governments of both countries dare not easily give in. Under such circumstances, if Trieste is to be stabilized and riots are eliminated, there is no better way than an international organization with a strong co-management government for the time being.</p>
<p>As far as the international situation is concerned, Yugoslavia is actually a vassal of the Soviet Union. The more control Yugoslavia has over Trieste, the more Soviet influence will penetrate, which is not what Britain and the United States want. In the past, all disputes concerning Trieste in the Council of Foreign Ministers and the Paris Peace Conference were centered on this point. Although France's principle of international co-management has been approved, however, in the details of implementation, any aspect has many opportunities to gain control. For example, demarcation, stationing troops, government organization, and election methods all require the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain, Yugoslavia and Italy, to make concessions to each other before an agreement can be reached.</p>
<p>Agence France-Presse reporters believe that the Trieste port agreement "makes the political horizon brighter." It also said: "The breakthrough in the deadlock is due to the Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's compromise attitude." When the Council of Foreign Ministers began on the afternoon of the 12th, the Soviet Union suggested that the Trieste port issue be handed over to the foreign ministers' representatives for further study, but the other foreign ministers opposed it, and the Soviet foreign minister immediately agreed to start discussing the matter on the 13th. From these signs, it may be possible to get through it. As for the other biggest difficulty, the stalemate between Italy and Yugoslavia, because both sides have expressed their willingness to negotiate directly, there seems to be hope for improvement.</p>
<p>According to a message from the Soviet News Agency in New York on the 12th, the improvement of Italian-Yugoslav relations is due to the talks between Yugoslav President Tito and Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti, which provided a positive factor for a general discussion of mutual issues on a friendly basis. Togliatti carried Tito's proposal, advocating that Italy retain Trieste, and that Grozia, the second largest city in the province of Venezia Giulia, be ceded to Yugoslavia. Whether Italy accepts Tito's proposal is of course still a question, because the cession of new land will inevitably be opposed by the Italian people. However, this at least proves that Yugoslavia no longer insists on annexing Trieste. And from riots and struggles to meeting negotiations, it is a progress after all.</p>
<p>The Trieste port issue, whether from the perspective of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain, or from the perspective of Italian-Yugoslav relations, has had new developments. Now, the Council of Foreign Ministers and direct negotiations between Italy and Yugoslavia are held simultaneously, using a two-pronged approach, which may be able to establish a solution that can be passed by all parties.</p>

<h3>Long-Standing Cracks Repaired at the Wrong Time: Seawall Collapses by Seven Meters: Tidal Surge Floods Chaopeng and Areas Outside the South Gate of Haining</h3>
<p>[Report from Haining by this newspaper] The seawall outside the South Gate of Mu County at "Zidoupantou" had sudden cracks months ago due to years of disrepair, and the situation was dangerous. The residents of Haining City repeatedly appealed, requesting immediate repairs, otherwise, if an accident occurred, the entire city would be flooded. However, due to the time-consuming transportation of materials and machinery, repairs have not yet been carried out. At around 8 pm on the 12th, the "Jue" character stone seawall was finally collapsed by the tide, with a gap of seven meters. Those that did not collapse were also crumbling. The tidal water rushed in and flooded the area outside the South Gate. The town government convened an emergency meeting and urgently telegraphed the Provincial Seawall Engineering Bureau, requesting that repairs be carried out quickly. Otherwise, if further damage occurs, it will be irreparable and cause an unprecedented tragedy.</p>
<p>[Report from Shaoxing by this newspaper] The Cao'e River concerns the water conservancy of Shaoxing, Shangyu, Xinchang, Shengxian and other counties. The water conservancy councils were organized by the counties, and the funds were 2.3 billion yuan. In addition to the provincial government allocating a part and the Good Relief and Relief Agency allocating work relief wheat flour, the shortfall was raised by the counties themselves.</p>
<h3>County Administration Moves Forward With Difficulty: Five Key Problems Summarized: Jiangsu Province Second District County Administration Review Conference: Resolutions on Public Security, Streamlining Government, and Other Policies</h3>
<p>[Report from Suzhou by this newspaper on the 15th] The Second District County Administration Review Conference opened at the Commissioner's Office at 9 am on the 15th. The attendees included Commissioner and District Security Commander Xu Baoguang, Deputy Commander Xia Boxun, the heads of various sections, and 20 people, including the magistrates of the eight counties. After the ceremonial greetings, Commissioner Xu gave an opening speech, indicating that the counties should ensure social security in the autumn when the suppression of bandits has not yet been completed and winter defense is continuing, and under the potential of a serious economic crisis in various places, and should make every effort to improve the autonomy of the Township-level organizations.</p>
<p>Reports from Various Counties</p>
<p>After the speech, the county magistrates successively presented detailed reports on the civil administration, finance, education, construction, and security departments, and painfully stated that the county administration has been in a difficult situation for the past year. The key problems are shocking to the listeners. To sum up, there are five points:</p>
<p>(1) Although finance is said to have restored the three-level system, in fact, there is no finance at the county level. For example, the land tax is 50% retained by the upper level. This number is based on the official quota rather than the actual collection. If it cannot be collected, the local area will have no income.</p>
<p>(2) The treatment of county-level personnel is even lower than that of the county-level tax collection offices, which has a great impact on the efficiency of promoting administration.</p>
<p>(3) Township expenses are not allocated at all, and township organs are nominal. General personnel are engaged in resolving civil disputes every day, and are indifferent to the promotion of government orders.</p>
<p>(4) Troops passing through or stationed treat the county government as an adjutant, responding to errands and being exhausted.</p>
<p>(5) The county magistrate has no power to control personnel and economy, and is restricted everywhere, making it impossible for the county government to exercise autonomy. There are countless other trivial and unspeakable secrets. The emotions of the county magistrates are extremely enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Discussion Proposals</p>
<p>The conference took a break at noon and began discussing proposals at 2:30 pm. The conclusions are briefly recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Public Security Problem: In order to ensure the smooth progress of prevention, suppression, and reform, in addition to the continued operation of the cadre training centers in various counties, joint prevention and suppression should be effectively strengthened. The District Security Command should transfer a platoon of security teams from each county, concentrate training, and unify command and coordination, with their own meals.</p>
<p>(2) Land Tax Problem: The promulgated city scales have been inspected and each tax unit is one jin short. It is estimated that the land tax quota will be more than 2,000 dans less in each county, and compensation should be requested. The provincial government should be required to reasonably adjust warehouse losses, transportation losses, and miscellaneous expenses. In addition, the central government should purchase the grain tax from various counties with reference to market prices and pay in installments in different places.</p>
<p>(3) Treatment Problem: The treatment of county-level civil servants should be submitted to the government for adjustment, at least to maintain a balance with the tax collection personnel.</p>
<p>(4) Anti-Smoking Problem: The penalties for the two crimes of trafficking and smoking are different. It should be submitted to the province for correction to show fairness.</p>
<p>(5) Temporary Military Service Conscription: There are many overly picky rejections. A supervision agency should be organized during the official conscription next year.</p>
<p>(6) Social economy is in a difficult situation every day. The budget for the next year should be requested from the provincial government to minimize the competent departments' undertakings as much as possible to make it practical, and to simplify the government orders to give the people a chance to recuperate.</p>
<p>(7) Pay attention to township production to provide sufficient township expenses and improve the infrastructure organization. The conference ended at around 6 pm.</p>
<h3>The Crabapple Blossoms</h3>

<h3>Western Zhejiang Salt Production Will Be Eliminated</h3>
<p>[Report from Hangzhou by this newspaper on the 15th] The Liangzhe Salt Administration originally administered seven counties each in Jiangxi and Anhui, the entire province of Zhejiang, and the city of Shanghai. The production area is the entire province of Zhejiang. In the western part of Zhejiang, the salt farmers and salt merchants directly negotiated prices. In the eastern part of Zhejiang, because there were more salt farmers and a larger amount of production, the Salt Administration negotiated the price with the salt farmers in order to prevent the salt from hurting the flourishing farmers during the slack season, and then sold it to the salt merchants. It is learned that starting from January next year, Liangzhe will universally adopt the system of direct price negotiation between salt farmers and salt merchants. The Administration has stored a large amount of edible salt in Lishui, Qu County, and Chun'an. If the price of salt is deliberately raised during the peak season, it can be released to stabilize it. It is also heard that some production areas in western Zhejiang will be forced to eliminate them in addition to natural elimination because the production volume is too small, which affects agricultural production and wastes manpower.</p>
<h3>Bengbu's Salt Reserves Increase: High Transportation Costs and Rising Prices</h3>
<p>[Report from Bengbu by this newspaper] Bengbu is a distribution center for Huai salt to the north of the Huai River and to the eastern counties of Henan. Since the interruption of the eastern section of the Longhai Railway and the obstruction of the salt river, transportation has been suspended. At the end of last month, there were only 20,000 dan of Huai salt in the city, and there was a shortage of supply. In view of this, the Salt Administration has strengthened the sea transportation of Huai salt to maintain the people's food, and transferred the original loan quota of 1.9 billion yuan for the five Strict Salt Provinces of Zhejiang salt to be used in the Anhui area first. The original amount of salt distributed to Bengbu City in October, November, and December was 240,000 dan. Later, after the salt merchants' efforts, another 116,000 dan were added, for a total of 356,000 dan. After the sea transportation was strengthened, the sources of Huai salt have been continuously transported to Bengbu in the past half month. There are now a total of 70,000 dan of salt in the city. However, recently, due to the gradual increase in transportation costs, the transportation cost per dan has reached 10,000 yuan, so the retail price per catty has also risen to 340 yuan.</p>

<h3>Old Woman from Lili Resurrected After Death</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Wujiang News] A farmer named Wang, from Fulu Village, Yougang Township, Lili District, in this county, is over fifty years old.

On the 8th of this month, a villager passing by heard a sound coming from inside the slightly opened coffin. He told his neighbors, who gathered to watch. They then opened the coffin and saw the corpse wriggling. Her face was gaunt and pale, and she urgently asked for a drink. Her son poured her a pot of water, which she drank in one gulp.

<h3>Request for Repair of Long-Broken Water Pipe</h3>
<p>There is an underground water pipe at the intersection of Kangding Road and Yanping Road, opposite the gate of the Municipal Yanping Road Elementary School and next to the bamboo fence, which suddenly broke at the end of last year. After being repaired, it unexpectedly broke again not long after, although not as severely as before. Clear water flowed out gurglingly, but for some reason, no one seemed to care. Later, the author left Shanghai for some business, and only returned after more than half a year. To my surprise, the broken water pipe was still unrepaired, and clear water was overflowing as before! Moreover, the road surface has been eroded into a ditch after being flooded for a long time. The clear water flows across Kangding Road, causing the road surface to be constantly damp. Recently, people have been urinating there, making it extremely dirty! As spring approaches, both sanitation and transportation are hampered. We respectfully request that the Municipal Bureau of Public Works and the Water Supply Company send personnel to inspect and repair it, and the residents there will be immensely grateful.

<h3>Further Explanation for Building a Bridge Across the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Regarding the construction of transportation connecting the east and west sides of the Huangpu River, some advocate building a tunnel, while others advocate building a bridge. Opinions are divided, and no decision has been heard of yet.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, building a bridge for this project is quite difficult because large ships frequently enter and exit the Huangpu River. The bridge must be extremely high, and the bridge abutments must be extended for several miles. Moreover, the ground in this area is sinking, and the bridge itself is too heavy, so the bridge piers (supports) may sink (this has already happened to the bridges across the Suzhou Creek). For these reasons, it can be seen that building a bridge is impossible. If a tunnel is built, the project will be huge and full of difficulties, and the cost will be enormous, which the municipal authorities cannot afford. Moreover, construction will take a long time, and there will be no end to completion. Therefore, my humble opinion is that building a floating pontoon bridge is the most suitable. As for this type of construction, a three-dimensional design can be adopted. My ideas are as follows:</p>
<p>The lower level is a pier, 80 feet wide and 120 feet long, consisting of several connected sections, equipped with hoisting equipment, which can serve as both a bridge and a pier (the middle two sections must be equipped with engines to open them when large ships pass through).</p>
<p>The upper level is a pedestrian walkway, with lightweight buildings built on both sides, like floating hotels, which can also be used as teahouses, bars, and various shops.</p>
<p>Each pier connection must have a gap of several feet, with an activity bridge to connect them tightly, to allow smaller vessels to pass through. In this way, construction will be easier, and it will be practical. I wonder what the municipal authorities think? (He Xigeng)</p>

<h3>Serious Situation in Northern Greece: Prime Minister Holds Emergency Meeting with Military Leaders and Opposition Parties: Former Foreign Minister Declares Current Situation Could Trigger World Conflict</h3>
<p>[News from Our Newspaper] London Broadcasting, 15th: Conflicts have occurred on the border between Greece and Yugoslavia, and the situation is very serious. The Deputy Minister of National Defense of Greece has flown to the Macedonian front. According to Greek officials, three days ago, the town of Skra, located six miles from the Yugoslav border in Greece, was occupied by the Southern Army, but after a counterattack by the Greek army, it retreated to the Southern border. The Greek side will lodge a complaint with the UN General Assembly regarding this incident.</p>
<p>[United Press Athens, 14th] According to the Thessaloniki Military News, two days ago, guerillas attacked Skra Village on the Greek border and a border outpost in Yugoslavia, causing the deaths of 50 men, women and children, and 43 soldiers. Greek military leaders and opposition party leaders held an emergency meeting with Prime Minister Tsaldaris tonight to discuss the serious situation in the north. The Governor of Macedonia, Loupoulos, also flew here from Thessaloniki on a special plane to attend the meeting. After the meeting, it was announced that the Army Chief of Staff and government representatives will fly to Thessaloniki tomorrow to inspect the chaotic situation on the ground.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 14th] Former Greek Foreign Minister Sophianopoulos said in an exclusive interview with our correspondent: The current situation in Greece could trigger a conflict between Greece and its northern neighbors, or even a world conflict. The civil war zone is gradually expanding from the provinces of Thessaly and Macedonia in the north to Sparta in the south, and British troops are also in danger of joining the battle. My visit to London this time is to draw attention to this serious situation and to ask the United Kingdom to morally support the organization of a united government in Greece, as organizing a coalition of parties is the only way to avoid extreme crisis. I believe that today is the mature stage for implementing the Varkiza Agreement, because after understanding the domestic and foreign crises, the people are tired of internal strife and are willing to reach a reconciliation. If British politicians can support it, it will certainly help the establishment of reconciliation. The first task of the united government after taking office would be to issue an amnesty, disarm civilians on both sides, and purge corrupt elements in the political, military, police, and gendarmerie, and then prepare voter registration and hold new elections. Only free elections can create domestic and international trust in the Greek government. According to what Mr. Su mentioned, the Varkiza Agreement was signed in February 1945, originally to end the internal strife that began in December 1944.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 15th] It was revealed here today that the Bulgarian government representative has issued a statement denying the Greek claim that Bulgarian mechanized units and aircraft are concentrated near the border between Greece, Bulgaria, and Turkey, saying that this news is "ridiculous."</p>
<h3>Sudden New Change in British Labour Party MPs' "Rebellion" Case: Foreign Policy Amendment Allowed for Debate in the House of Commons: US Believes it is Identical to the Wallace Incident</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 15th] There was a sudden new change in the Labour Party MPs' "rebellion" case this morning. Speaker of the House Brown announced that he was prepared to submit the foreign policy amendment and conscription amendment proposed by them for discussion. Last night, the general feeling was that the foreign policy amendment would not be submitted for discussion, so the "rebellion" movement would soon succumb. Unexpectedly, the Speaker's announcement this morning changed the situation. Our newspaper's political correspondent said that the intention of this new development was to place the more than 70 "rebel" Labour MPs in a difficult position. Speaker Brown said that the debate on the King's speech in Parliament will continue on Monday in order to discuss the amendments proposed by Crossman and others. If necessary, he is prepared to formally allow debate on this amendment. (The Speaker has the power to decide which amendment can be submitted for debate and vote) Observers believe that the Speaker's announcement is intended to place the responsibility for continuing the "rebellion" firmly on the shoulders of the "rebel" MPs. They must decide before Monday whether to face the attacks from the government and other Labour MPs in Parliament.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 14th] The number of signatories to the "rebel" Labour MPs' foreign policy amendment increased by 13 today, bringing the total to 57, which will not be difficult to exceed 60. However, since Prime Minister Attlee made a strong speech yesterday, some of the original signatories have wavered in their determination and expressed surprise at Prime Minister Attlee's firm attitude, so they may not continue to pursue the matter. Lord President of the Council Morrison also issued a warning to these "rebel" Labour MPs, telling them that if such "rebellious" actions continue to be launched, the Labour Party rules, which were suspended at the beginning of this year, may be restored. It is generally believed that the leaders who launched this "rebellion" may be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with party rules.</p>
<h3>US Attaches Great Importance</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 14th] Here, great attention is being paid to the "rebellion" of British Labour MPs, which is seen as an "anti-American and pro-Soviet" action. Some people compare this incident to the dispute between Wallace and Byrnes in the United States. American newspapers commented that the number of "rebels" is not large enough to change the government's foreign policy, but Moscow cannot help but doubt the consistency of the Anglo-American stance. Reports from London say that if the British government is forced to change its foreign policy, Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton will succeed as Foreign Secretary. The first task after taking office will be to fly to Moscow to seek the basis for Anglo-Soviet cooperation. Howard newspaper reporter Denny said that the "rebel" Labour MPs believe that the capitalist and imperialist United States has bewitched Attlee and Bevin, making them willing to work for gold-based diplomacy.</p>
<h3>South Africa Annexes Southwest Africa: US Expresses Opposition</h3>
<p>[Reuters Lake Success, New York, 14th] At a meeting of the United Nations Trusteeship Council today, representatives from India, Mexico, Syria, Bolivia and other countries firmly opposed South Africa's request to merge Southwest Africa. The US delegation also distributed a formal statement at the beginning of the meeting, stating that the United States was willing to express its support for the opinions of some other delegations, believing that the documents submitted to the United Nations General Assembly by the South African delegation were insufficient to enable the Assembly to approve the incorporation of the Southwest African trusteeship territory into the Union of South Africa.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Abuses Veto Power, Small Country Representatives Criticize Strongly, Australia Proposes Three Remedial Measures</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, New York, 14th] The United Nations Political Committee held a meeting today lasting three hours. Representatives from seven small countries, including Cuba, Argentina, the Philippines, and New Zealand, voiced opposition to the veto power, calling it an expression of "great power dictatorship." Only Poland defended the veto power.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 14th] Australian representative Hasluck, in his speech to the Political Committee today, first accused the Soviet Union of abusing the veto power. When he introduced a resolution on the veto power, he stated that the questions raised by the Australian delegation to the Committee were not to revise the veto power provision of Article 27, but whether the great powers had fulfilled their accepted obligations when adopting that article. Hasluck then reviewed the work of the Security Council, pointing out that the Soviet Union had used the veto power as many as ten times. The most obvious and egregious thing was that a permanent member could arbitrarily choose a resolution to use its veto power on. In other words, the privileges stipulated in Article 27 have been pushed to a dangerous point, allowing a member of the Security Council to not only interfere with the actions of the Council but also to interfere with what the Council intends to do. Hasluck's accusations can be summarized into three points: (1) The spirit of the Charter has not been followed; the use of the veto power exceeds the original intention of the San Francisco Conference and violates the guarantees made by the great powers at the San Francisco Conference. (2) The manner in which the veto power is used manipulates the work of the Security Council, undermines public trust in the Council, and reduces the effectiveness of the Security Council. (3) Permanent members use the veto power as part of their national policy, forgetting their responsibilities to the Charter and no longer speaking on behalf of other members. Therefore, the Australian delegation proposes the following measures for remedy: (1) Permanent members of the Security Council should limit the use of the veto power. (2) Increase the exchange of views among the five powers. (3) Improve the Security Council system so that procedural issues do not require constant voting.</p>

<h3>United States Considers Severing Relations with Romania, Romanian Government Infringes on Freedom of Opposition Parties</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 14th] A responsible person told this agency's reporter that US Secretary of State Byrnes is working closely with the State Department and Undersecretary of State Acheson to study the possibility of the US severing diplomatic relations with the Romanian government.

The note was signed by the Romanian National Peasants' Party, National Liberal Party, and Independent Socialist Party, demanding the restoration of the freedom and rights of the opposition parties, guaranteeing the personal freedom of voters and candidates, and that the military police and authorities should take a fair stance.</p>
<h3>Eden Advocates for British-Soviet Friendship</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 14th] The British House of Commons met today to continue debating the King's speech. Former Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech stating that if Britain and the Soviet Union can maintain a permanent friendly relationship, it will greatly benefit European peace. As for the German question, the current situation in the British occupied zone of Germany has caused extreme concern in our country. Our government must proceed steadily, face reality, and this is the time. However, if other countries are not prepared to fulfill the obligations stipulated in their international agreements, then we cannot fulfill them either. I now know that the Potsdam Agreement has become an excuse for various failures, but in fact, these failures are caused by other reasons. As for the relationship between our country and the countries of Western Europe, I also advocate that we should maintain close economic and cultural relations with France and other countries in Western Europe. Eden went on to express support for the government's protests to Poland and Romania, believing that the failure of the governments of those two countries to protect free elections was a major blow to democracy.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Attlee Urges Search for New Goods Markets</h3>

<h3>Rumor of Agreement Between China and East Indies</h3>
<p>Dutch to Reorganize Territories</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Batavia, 15th] According to sources in the East Indies, China seems to be asking the Republic of Indonesia to sign an agreement to protect the interests of the overseas Chinese in Java and Sumatra.</p>
<p>[United Press International, The Hague, 14th] The Dutch government announced today that it would completely reorganize the Dutch territories, placing the East Indies and the Netherlands on an equal footing, nominally under Dutch rule, and jointly handling foreign affairs and national defense, and, when necessary, also handling finance, economy, and culture. According to Dutch Prime Minister Peel's announcement in parliament, the Dutch Commissioner in the East Indies proposed changing the "Kingdom of the Netherlands" to the "United Nations of the Netherlands East Indies," with Queen Wilhelmina as the head of the United Nations, formed by two countries, namely the "Federation of the East Indies" and the "Kingdom of the Netherlands." The Federation of the East Indies consists of the Republic of Indonesia, Java, Sumatra, East Indonesia, and Borneo; the Kingdom of the Netherlands consists of the Netherlands proper and Surinam and Curaçao in the West Indies. This draft agreement to resolve the East Indies revolution is expected to be signed in Batavia on the 15th. Peel also announced that the Kingdom of the Netherlands will not be split, but will only adapt to the needs of the times and change its form and name. According to a senior official in Java, the Federation of the East Indies will include the former Dutch East Indies archipelago, except for regions that request separation.

<h3>Roosevelt's Telegram to Japanese Emperor Was Held Back by Staff, Witness Testifies</h3>
<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 15th] The Far East International Military Tribunal continued to hear testimony today from Shiroo Chishiro, a staff member of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Japanese Ministry of Communications, explaining the reason for the delay in delivering Roosevelt's telegram to US Ambassador Grew to Japan. Shiroo testified that on November 29, 1941, when he was a supervisor in the Telegraph Inspection Office of the Ministry of Communications, Lieutenant Colonel Tomura Morio of the Communications Section of the General Staff Headquarters came to inform him that all diplomatic telegrams must be delayed by five hours before being sent out. This order applied to all telegrams except those from the Japanese government and those related to Germany and Italy. Shiroo learned of the contents of President Roosevelt's telegram to the Japanese Emperor between 4 and 6 pm on December 7. At this time, Tomura called again to inform him that telegrams must now be delayed by fifteen hours. He did not remember who handled the president's telegram that day. At 4 am on December 18, the head of the Overseas Telegraph Section of the Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications informed Shiroo by telephone that, upon the order of the Army, all overseas communications must be stopped. Defense attorneys Kiyose and Brooks questioned Shiroo, wanting to prove that the purpose of the General Staff Headquarters' order to delay telegrams was purely to strengthen inspections, and not solely for Roosevelt's telegram, but they did not achieve their goal.</p>
<p>Hull Lambasted the Japanese Government</p>
<p>Prosecutors then produced various documents, including documents from US diplomatic relations stating that Japanese Ambassador to the US Nomura and Kurusu first requested to meet with US Secretary of State Hull at 1 pm on December 7, and then requested a delay of 45 minutes. As a result, Hull received the two at 2:28 pm, and Nomura handed the official document to Hull, saying that he was ordered to hand it over at 1 pm, but it was delayed due to translating the telegram. Hull then asked: Is this being submitted upon the order of the Japanese government? Nomura replied yes. Hull then said: In the past nine months, I have spoken to you without a single falsehood. In my fifty years of public service, I never imagined that any government on Earth could speak such words, and I have never seen a document so full of shameful falsehoods and distortions. Nomura and Kurusu remained silent and quietly withdrew. It is reported that the Japanese military launched a sneak attack on Pearl Harbor at 1:28 pm Washington time.</p>

<h3>Atomic Disease Not Yet Eradicated, Japanese Ophthalmologist Publishes Clinical Paper</h3>
<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 15th] Koyanaire Hyakufu, an ophthalmologist at Nagasaki Medical University Hospital in Japan, presented a paper on corneal or retinal burns caused by the atomic bomb at an ophthalmology conference today. It is said that more than ten patients with burns to the eyeball have been found, all of whom are unmarried women. Because the light was so strong, the retina of the eye was irritated. Mild cases can be completely cured, but severe cases are very difficult. From this, it can be seen that the symptoms of atomic disease have not been completely eliminated. Currently, there are still 280 atomic disease patients in the hospital, 130 of whom still have black spots on their eyeballs or skin of their hands and feet. Most of the others have hair loss, a unique symptom of atomic disease, but they are gradually recovering. Surprisingly, there are five people in a cement house only 0.5 meters from the blast center who were completely unharmed. The results of this comprehensive study will be published abroad in detail soon.</p>
<h3>Goering's Will Circulates Again</h3>
<p>Original Hidden in Allied Control Council</p>
<p>[Reuters, Frankfurt, 13th] A copied "Goering's Will" was recently discovered in Nuremberg. Many Germans believe that this is one of the three letters left by Goering before his suicide. Its content is undoubtedly a forgery, as the original letter is now in the archives of the Allied Control Council in Berlin, marked with the words "Absolutely Confidential, Copy Burned," which no outsider could possibly know. Nuremberg residents received the contents of Goering's "Will" printed on the wrapping paper when they received their meat rations in the morning. The will was addressed to the German people, stating: Although the Allies are smart, I am smarter. Although the Allies have won the war, it is up to you whether they can win the peace. During the Nuremberg trials, I discovered that the Germans had engaged in the most horrific acts, many of which were acts that a self-respecting German would not dare to do. The victors have sufficient evidence, even to convince me, but many other acts were necessary, such as the bombing of Warsaw, Rotterdam, and Coventry. To fight for the survival of my nation, these orders had to be issued. The Führer is dead. I can assure you that the Führer and I left you because we were confident that you did not need us and could stand up in hardship. You have learned a lot in the past thirteen years. Everything else can be forgotten, but one thing must always be remembered: that the Germans will one day be able to show the world their mission.</p>
<h3>Nobel Prize Winners Announced</h3>

<h3>American Archaeologists Uncover Mythology of Japanese Founding</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 14th] Many American archaeologists recently excavated ruins on a small island near the Matsushima Peninsula, discovering a large number of skeletons and pottery, which appear to be relics of the Ainu people. It is said that the Ainu of Hokkaido are the original people of the Japanese archipelago, but their history cannot be traced because Japanese history begins in the sixth century AD. Before this, the remains had disappeared. Therefore, the Japanese spoke nonsense, claiming that the founding ancestor Emperor Jimmu was the grandson of the Sun Goddess, thinking that there would be no evidence of death. Now that historical traces have been discovered, scholars can expose Japanese mythology and establish a reliable history for Japan.</p>
<h3>Koo Vi-kyuin's Speech Praises Nehru</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 14th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Dr. Koo Vi-kyuin was the main speaker at the Nehru birthday banquet tonight, and he praised the leader of the Indian National Government. Dr. Koo said: "I believe that what is particularly praiseworthy about Mr. Nehru is his selflessness and his heartfelt service to the country. His moral courage is exemplary. In order to achieve India's freedom, he never considered his personal freedom. We can even say that this birthday is a rebirth for him and his great country, because today Mr. Nehru has become the de facto administrative head of India."</p>

<h3>US Military Blood Plasma Flows into Black Market, Astonishing Quantity Worth Considerable Price, Red Cross Protests, Foreign Liquidation Committee is Recovering, US State Department Attaches Importance and Orders Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>[United Press, This City Report] Tens of thousands of units of blood plasma donated by the American people to the US military during the war have been transferred to the Shanghai black market and sold for US$25 per pint. According to the Shanghai branch of the Foreign Liquidation Committee, the inflow of this blood plasma into the Shanghai market was due to "lack of supervision." It is said that this blood plasma, along with a large number of medical supplies, was announced by the US Navy on Okinawa Island as "surplus materials." After being transferred to the Shanghai branch of the Foreign Liquidation Committee, the contents were not carefully inspected, so it was sold together with other medical supplies. The American Red Cross believes that the blood plasma is the property of the Association and, according to military rules, all donated blood plasma and other medical supplies from the Red Cross that have been used by the military must be returned to the Red Cross for free distribution to hospitals or other organizations. Therefore, the Red Cross protested to the Foreign Liquidation Committee, which has agreed to find a way to recover it. According to well-informed sources, the Foreign Liquidation Committee sold this blood plasma for an average price of about US$0.50 to US$0.75 per unit. The sale of blood plasma was discovered because advertisements were published in Chinese newspapers. It is reported that this blood plasma has been scattered in various warehouses and pharmacies in the city. The Foreign Liquidation Committee has contacted Chinese merchants to find ways to repurchase the blood plasma. It is estimated that the total amount of blood plasma flowing into the Shanghai market is about 290 kiloliters, worth about US$10 million.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 15th] An official announced that the State Department immediately ordered the representative of the Foreign Liquidation Committee in Shanghai to investigate the matter upon receiving the Shanghai report from the United Press stating that US blood plasma was being sold in the Shanghai black market.</p>

<h3>Mrs. Cripps Hosts Reporters at the Mayor's Residence to Discuss Aid to China; Visits Army Hospital This Afternoon; Broadcasts Domestically and Internationally This Evening</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Mrs. Cripps, President of the British United Aid to China Fund, arrived in Shanghai from Peiping the day before yesterday. At 10 a.m. yesterday, accompanied by Mrs. Miller, the Fund's Secretary-General, she held a press conference at Mayor Wu's residence to report on the establishment and work of the Fund. It was stated that after the outbreak of World War II, Sir Stafford Cripps visited India, China, the Soviet Union, and the United States before returning to England. His diaries written in China aroused Mrs. Cripps' great interest in the Chinese people. At the same time, Mrs. Cripps learned about the suffering of the Chinese people from Bishop Hall of Hong Kong, which further increased her sympathy for China, leading her to establish the British United Aid to China Fund in 1942. At that time, Mrs. Cripps broadcast to the British people to raise funds for aid to China, with a target of 500,000 pounds. However, the result was only 360,000 pounds, but this achievement exceeded any previous fundraising effort. Donations came from people of all parties and from all parts of Britain, accumulating from small contributions. The Fund's fundraising for aid to China has so far reached 1.8 million pounds. More than 700 units have been distributed to various Chinese organizations, including the China Welfare Fund Committee, run by Madame Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching-ling, which receives a monthly donation of 11 million Chinese yuan. Other recipients include the Yan'an International Peace Hospital, Shenyang Christian Hospital, and various medical institutions and children's nurseries.

However, the Fund's work to help China will continue, and will proceed after discussions with the Chinese authorities.</p>

<h3>Conclusion of the GuangZhao Association Lawsuit</h3>
<p>The lawsuit against Liang Yuming, Chairman of the Reorganization Committee of the GuangZhao Association of this city, for alleged fraud, breach of trust, and conspiracy to elect the chairman, has been ongoing for a long time. It is now learned that the two cases have been judged separately by the court, and the circumstances are as follows: After the GuangZhao Association submitted a report to the Social Bureau to appoint a reorganization committee, the committee, through corrupt election, elected Liang Yuming as the chairman. However, Feng Shaoshan, the former custodian of the association, was late in handing over the assets. Furthermore, Liu Tiemei and Zhang Wenjun, staff members of the association who were responsible for disaster relief, sued Liang Yuming in the Shanghai District Court for fraudulently obtaining more than 5 million yuan. After investigation by prosecutor Zhang Yuanzhen, it was determined that Liang Yuming had not committed fraud or breach of trust, and on October 23, a decision was made not to prosecute. At the same time, Lu Xingyuan filed a complaint in the civil court, accusing Liang Yuming of violating the charter and conspiring to elect the chairman, requesting confirmation that the election was invalid and ordering him to bear the litigation costs. After questioning by the civil court, it was determined that the allegations were not factual, and a judgment was also issued yesterday, dismissing the lawsuit and ordering the plaintiff to bear the litigation costs.</p>

The victim, Yu Peng, testified in court about the crimes of Kanohara and others, and the confrontation was accurate. Kanohara and others' implementation of violence against the arrested suspects was a clear violation of international war conventions and should be prosecuted for corruption.</p>

<h3>Fight Over Dancers: Brandishing Guns as a Show of Force; Young Master of Tongchang Car Company Detained for Three Days as a Warning</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Zhu Dechun, 24, the young master of the Tongchang Car Company on Yunnan Road, residing at No. 3, Lane 176, Jiangyin Street, and his friend Xue Zhiyi and others, had a conflict with Mao Zongshu, the young master of the Tingdali Dance Hall, over dancers sitting at their tables at the New Xianlin Dance Hall at 12 p.m. on the 24th of last month. They then started fighting. In a moment of desperation, Zhu brandished his self-defense pistol as a show of force. Officers from the Shanghai North District Inspection Office of the Garrison Command happened to pass by, and seeing the commotion inside the dance hall, and fearing trouble, they stepped forward and took the pistol from Zhu. Upon inspection, the bullets were found to be loaded. At that time, police officers from the Beijing West Road Police Station of the Jing'an Temple Sub-bureau also arrived after hearing the news, and took both parties to the sub-bureau for questioning.

<h3>Opening of the Fundraising Campaign of the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association; Copper Pig Auctioned on the Spot; Fundraising Target of 200 Million Yuan Expected to Be Reached</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Chinese Leprosy Relief Association held the opening ceremony of its 7th fundraising campaign at Kang Le Restaurant at 4 p.m. yesterday. Those present included the honorary general captain of the association, Mayor Wu Guozhen, honorary deputy captain Director Zhang Wei, and guests Quan Shaowen, Xu Zhendong, Gu Chunfan, Xu Yongzuo, and more than 100 others. First, Yan Fuling delivered the opening speech on behalf of Chairman Diao Xinde (who was late due to illness), stating that there are approximately one million leprosy patients in the country. The Da Chang Leprosy Sanatorium in this city has not been repaired due to the need for repair funds of approximately 200 million yuan; it currently only accommodates 58 patients and urgently needs to raise enough funds to accommodate 150 patients. In addition, equipment fees of approximately 50 million yuan, subsidies for leprosy sanatoriums across the country of 20 million yuan, and operating expenses for the association next year of approximately 30 million yuan, totaling approximately 300 million yuan, are needed. The International Leprosy Relief Association has promised to donate US$20,000, and the Executive Yuan will donate some equipment. He urged all sectors to actively support the campaign. Then, Mayor Wu delivered a speech, stating that leprosy patients often suffer from numbness, and recovery takes time. They deserve everyone's sympathy and relief. Isolation and treatment can reduce the spread of the disease. Zhang Wei then delivered a speech, describing the history of leprosy, modern treatment techniques, and the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association's enthusiasm for struggle and service. Secretary-General Guo Zhijian reported on the association's affairs and the organization of the fundraising team. Then, Qi Zhi, the general captain of the fundraising team, Wang Jitao, the deputy general captain, and foreign guest Mr. Lee successively delivered speeches. Finally, guest Mr. Wang auctioned off copper charity pigs, which were divided into large, medium, and small sizes. The large size was priced at 500,000 yuan each, and one was purchased by each of Lu Meiseng, Qi Zhi, Wang Jitao, and Qi Yunqing. The medium size was priced at 250,000 yuan, and one was purchased by each of Xu Zhendong and Zhang Xiling. The small size was priced at 100,000 yuan, and one was purchased by He Xingyuan.</p>
<p>The origin of the charity pig is as follows: In the past, there was a person named Mr. Card, who was dedicated to relieving leprosy patients. He wanted to relieve ten leprosy patients, but only had US$205, which was not enough for one person. His son, although young, was full of sympathy and did not sleep all night. The next morning, he suggested to his father that he buy a small pig to raise, and wait for it to grow up, and then use the proceeds to make up the difference. The children in the neighborhood knew that this pig was being raised to relieve leprosy, and all donated good feed. In a few months, it was exceptionally fat and strong, and was sold for US$25, which was donated to leprosy relief. This is the short history of the charity pig.</p>
<p>The atmosphere at the meeting yesterday was enthusiastic. It is predicted that the fundraising result will exceed the original target.</p>
<h3>American Booksellers Discuss Reprinting Books: Violates the Provisions of the Sino-American Treaty of Commerce</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After the signing of the Sino-American Treaty of Commerce, Article 9, which stipulates that both contracting parties should have all rights and advantages of any nature with respect to copyright and literary and artistic works, has aroused concern and anxiety in the publishing industry in China. It is generally believed that due to the signing of this treaty, the unauthorized reprinting and sale of Western books will be prohibited in the future. From a legal and objective standpoint, "copyright" should be respected. However, in the future, college and university students will lose the convenience of enjoying cheap reprints of balanced production books. As for translation rights, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently stated that the treaty also had a protocol stipulating that if Chinese laws and regulations do not provide protection against translation for Chinese people, then the same protection does not need to be provided to Americans. The "Copyright Law" of our country does not prohibit translation, so the treaty does not have much impact on the general book industry and publishing industry.</p>
<p>The reporter also interviewed Pang Tiemo, the manager of Sino-American Bookstore. He was extremely indignant about the unauthorized reprinting of Western books by the Chinese publishing industry, believing that this was no different from theft, and pointed to the reprint advertisement for anatomy books published by a certain bookstore in the newspaper, telling the reporter: although the treaty has been stipulated, reprinting continues as before! He has reported this situation to American publishing houses and will take appropriate steps after the treaty is effectively implemented.</p>
<h3>Eight Years of Arduous Struggle: Military Medicine Advances, Jiangwan Builds National Defense Medical Center, New Equipment, Excellent Environment, May Become a National Demonstration Zone</h3>
<p>The War of Resistance against Japan gave our country's military medical work a severe test, but it also opened up a path towards modernization. A senior military officer objectively reviewed the contributions of military medicine during the eight years of arduous struggle to reporters, frankly admitting two regrets: First, the enemy's firepower was too strong, making our country's rescue work difficult. Seriously wounded soldiers at the front lines sometimes could not be saved. Second, the training of rescue personnel was insufficient. Some had too little knowledge and lacked a strong sense of responsibility, so it was sometimes impossible to achieve their mission while taking risks. However, even with the above shortcomings, no large-scale infectious diseases occurred in the military during the eight years of the War of Resistance. In the spring of 1942, when retreating from northern Guizhou, an acute outbreak of bubonic plague suddenly occurred among the retreating people, with more than two thousand deaths every day. If this disease had spread in the troops, it would have undermined the combat effectiveness of the national army, but thanks to the implementation of effective epidemic prevention work, the army escaped this major disaster. Therefore, he said: In fairness, military medical work had its contributions during the war. Of course, there were weaknesses, and these weaknesses need to be addressed and improved so that the military medical work of the national army can embark on the road to modernization.</p>
<p>Insufficient Manpower and Resources</p>
<p>In the autumn of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), our country's military medical work was insufficient to cope with a long-term international war. The objective conditions were too inadequate. In terms of manpower, the entire national army was estimated to need 30,000 doctors. But there were only 10,000 doctors in the whole country! We could not effectively conscript doctors. When the war shifted to the rear, even fewer doctors moved inland with the government. The lack of military doctors directly affected the health care and life-saving efforts of the soldiers. At the same time, 40% of the diagnosis and treatment of patients relied on doctors, and 60% relied on nurses, but there was a severe shortage of trained nurses in the national army. In terms of material resources, a good hospital must have three conditions: buildings, nurses, and beds. In wartime China, these were out of the question, and the suffering of the soldiers was exacerbated. Especially during major battles, there were too many casualties, which made the limited field hospitals overwhelmed. During the Battle of Shanghai, three thousand people could be sent to the hospital in one day. On the Shanghai-Jiading line, sometimes only one company returned from a division! This tragic sacrifice also meant that limited facilities could not take care of the wounded warriors at the same time. Originally, this situation also existed in foreign countries. For example, during the Dunkirk evacuation, British wounded soldiers did not receive treatment for a week. In the retreat from India to Guizhou, wounded soldiers were forgotten. However, these were ultimately regrets.</p>
<p>Different Factions of Medical Officers</p>
<p>In addition to the lack of manpower and resources, differences in the training and level of medical officers also caused many unnecessary difficulties. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, the troops were not modern enough, and medical officers had not undergone unified training. Their educational levels were different, and their medical achievements were also very different. This naturally produced factionalism, reduced work efficiency, and complicated the difficulty of medical supply. Those who learned American medicine wanted to use American drugs; those who specialized in German medicine would only use German drugs; some were perhaps Chinese medicine practitioners, and they neither believed in nor understood Western medicine. But the army is not a department store; it cannot have everything. Therefore, our troops were particularly short of medicines. At the same time, it is undeniable that there were many shortcomings in our country's wartime conscription. Before enlisting, the physical condition and age of soldiers were not strictly checked. After entering the camp, new recruits were often found to have diseases that should not be in the military, and the military did not have preparations for these drugs. Naturally, there was a shortage of drugs, which was also a fact. Before Guangzhou was lost in the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), we bought a large batch of medicines in Hong Kong, which even caused the Hong Kong government to find it strange. But in retrospect, it was fortunate that this transaction took place, otherwise, there would have been an even greater shortage of medicines.</p>
<p>Serving Without Avoiding Hardship</p>
<p>It is conceivable that it was difficult to cope with an unprecedented war with insufficient preparation. In order to solve the shortage of manpower, the Military Medical Department set up short-term training classes to train 10,000 medical officers and assigned them to serve in various armies. Although these hastily trained medical officers felt that their knowledge and experience were insufficient, they did not avoid difficulties, and their enthusiasm for service was very high. In wartime military medical work, in addition to insufficient material resources, we also suffered greatly from inconvenient transportation. For example, in the U.S. military, their medical equipment could be very complex and thoughtful, while we could only strive for simplicity and ease of transport. The reason is that we have too few means of transportation, and too many things will damage mobility. The lack of these material conditions could only be compensated for by the enthusiasm of the staff.</p>
<p>Medicines Rely Entirely on the United States</p>
<p>External assistance mainly relied on the United States. Today, a fair criticism is that the United States has indeed made its best efforts, but the actual benefits our country has received are limited. The objective reasons are as follows: First, the "Europe First" principle guided the entire strategy and supply. Not only did more than 90% of the materials under the Lend-Lease Act go to Britain and the Soviet Union, but even in terms of medicines, more than half went to the European battlefield. The second reason is that the island-hopping war in the Pacific was the main battlefield in the Far East in the eyes of the Allies, and a lot of medical aid went there. Third, at that time, China's supply route was only the airlift over the "Hump," which had to fly over the highest mountains in the world and was at risk of interception by Zero fighters. Many American pilots sacrificed in this area. Medicines were continuously transported from this airlift line to Kunming, but it was only a small part of the limited supply. Finally, the Chinese battlefield area was too wide, and the number of national troops was very large. Once the limited medicines were distributed to various war zones, the quantity was very small. However, even if foreign aid was not as large as our country expected, when we think about the fact that the United States was supplying the whole world, we should still deeply thank our friends who did not avoid danger and provided timely help.</p>
<p>Three Tasks After the War</p>
<p>After the victory, military medical work ended the dark years of wartime support and moved towards a bright, modern path. All current plans and efforts are in line with the overall plan for military building. The current specific tasks are: First, to select soldiers for the new army, to standardize the physical fitness of the army, and to distinguish its "types," using scientific methods to determine the soldier's performance and the tasks he is best suited to undertake. In the United States, this system has been implemented for a long time. New soldiers are classified and categorized like commodities, and people and things are closely matched. Our country is just beginning to take this path. The second is the health care work in the military, which will be strictly implemented in the military in the future. It is not difficult for us to obtain new weapons, but we need soldiers who are physically and mentally sound to use these weapons. The third task is the self-strengthening of the military medical institutions themselves. All medical and health tools will be adjusted and modernized. The standards for medical supply require a large number of training for military doctors to adapt to the needs of the new army; the training and development of nurses will also not be neglected. In the future, a large number of experts will be used in the health work of the troops, not only focusing on physical fitness, but also on psychology. With these facilities, a new modern national defense army can be established.</p>
<p>Jiangwan Medical Center</p>
<p>The effort to modernize the health work of the troops is manifested in the establishment of the National Defense Medical Center in Jiangwan in the Shanghai area. At the core of this medical center is the Shanghai Army Hospital, and the periphery includes nursing schools, military medical schools, hygiene laboratories, and hygiene service training centers. The Shanghai Army Hospital was the enemy's No. 157 military hospital during the enemy's occupation period, and the current reorganization work has not yet been completed, and the traces of the Japanese living there are obvious. I asked a responsible military officer for his comments on the Japanese military hospital. His reply was that the Japanese rear station hospital was not clean and the equipment inside was too old. But it had everything it should have. As for the Japanese military medical system, it was quite good. There are a total of twelve army hospitals in our country, including those in Taiwan. Now new medical equipment is coming in continuously. Due to the superior objective conditions, the medical center in the Jiangwan area may be a demonstration area.</p>
<p>American Donation Fund</p>
<p>The military medical laboratory in the Hygiene Laboratory is still a Sino-American cooperative undertaking. This institution is administratively under the Military Medical Department, but it is economically and strongly assisted by the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China. It has allocated 250,000 US dollars in one lump sum to donate to the laboratory as a foundation, with 150,000 US dollars to purchase equipment and 100,000 US dollars for other purposes. They also occupy an important position in technical guidance. I visited their blood plasma intravenous fluid department, animal laboratory, disinfection distillation department, etc., and saw a lot of new equipment and storage. I deeply felt that in an environment where friends are willing to help, the most important thing is to work hard ourselves and not to live up to the good opportunity!</p>

<h3>Shen Siliang's Preliminary Hearing Yesterday; Claimed Submission to the Puppet Regime Was to Cope with the Environment and Protect School Property; The High Prosecutor's Office Indicted and Requested Lenient Treatment; Chen Lifu and Yan Huiqing Provided Letters to Testify</h3>
<p>[This newspaper reported] Shen Siliang, the former president of St. John's University, was arrested by the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters on June 25 this year under a secret order from the National Government and transferred to the Procuratorate of the High Court of this city. After four months of investigation, he was finally prosecuted on suspicion of being a traitor. The indictment listed the facts of the crime, but stated that his submission to the enemy and participation in the puppet regime was aimed at adapting to the environment, maintaining the school, and preventing students from being left without education, which was different from ordinary traitors who colluded with the enemy. It was requested that the High Court grant lenient treatment. The case was initially heard in the High Court yesterday afternoon, and the interrogation lasted more than an hour. The court ordered that the case still needed further investigation and adjourned for another hearing. The defendant was still detained.</p>
<p>Shen wore a gray suit and black leather shoes, his hair was already streaked with white, and his expression was haggard. He said in a low voice: I am 51 years old, from Ningbo. I live at St. John's University and have worked at the school for 30 years. I have been the president of the school since January 1940. In 1938, I went to Chongqing to ask the then Minister of Education, Chen Lifu, for instructions, who instructed me to return to Shanghai to continue maintaining the school. Among the puppet positions mentioned in the indictment, such as member of the puppet Greater East Asia Anti-British and Anti-American Association, member of the puppet New National Movement Promotion Association, and member of the Education Committee of the puppet Shanghai Special Municipality Citizens' Welfare Association, I did not participate in any of them, and there was no such thing. As for what was stated in the puppet New China Handbook, my name was put in without seeking my consent in advance, and there was no way to publish a statement in the newspaper at that time. Also, as for the Standing Director of the puppet Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Shanghai Branch, my name was also put in by the then puppet mayor Chen Gongbo. The Deputy Director of the puppet Shanghai National Sports Association was written by Chu Minyi, and none of them sought my consent. As for the puppet Enemy Property Management Committee, I attended two meetings because the school property was under the military management of the Japanese at that time, and there was a seal on the gate. Attending the meeting only knew how to take over St. John's, and the chairman of the committee was Zhang Sumin. As for serving as a member of the puppet Shanghai Special Municipality Municipal Advisory Committee, I took the position since Chen Gongbo served as the puppet mayor, but I only attended the meetings and did not express any opinions or proposals. Because the committee was a representative of public opinion, there was no salary. When Zhou Fohai served as the puppet mayor, I did not participate. As for serving as the chairman of the puppet Sports Association and the chairman of the Football Federation, I was recommended because I had some history in sports in the past. But this is a public organization, and my sports purpose is only to talk about amateur technology and not politics. The football association only manages seasonal games and cup games, and nothing else. Therefore, as for the organization of football teams to raise funds to supply Ding Mocun's secret service funds, it may be that they directly contacted the various teams, which I could not control. In February 1943, I went to Beijing in the name of the president of St. John's University to attend the puppet Third National Education Administration Conference, because the Japanese coveted the school property, I was ordered by the American Bishop Lo Peide to go and perfunctorily deal with it, but I returned before the closing ceremony, and did not make any speeches or proposals. As for serving as the chief of the Ning District of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Baojia Committee, I was publicly elected by the people, but because the school was busy, I only met once a month to discuss local matters. As for attending a joint performance at the puppet Anti-British and Anti-American Association's first congress, and attending the welcome banquet for the enemy Ambassador Koki Hirota and Wang Jingwei, there was no such thing. I did not participate in the commission appointed by the Japanese-initiated puppet Dalian, Shanghai, and Nanjing Anti-Sports Committee to serve as the vice chairman. Sakamoto Yoshitaka and Tagawa Daikichi, two professors, were hired at St. John's University to teach economics and history courses, not to serve as consultants. It was not to monitor students. It was only because at that time, there was a rumor that the Japanese intended to send Japanese to various schools to take on homework, so I first asked these two to resist. These two were Christian disciples and were also dissatisfied with their domestic politics. The school's curriculum was no different from before the war, with no addition of the Japanese Constitution, Japanese Economy, or History of the Meiji Restoration. At that time, in order to avoid accidents, I did not allow any extracurricular activities except for the Christian fellowship. As the president of the school, I also have a patriotic heart. Everything is to avoid immediate losses, otherwise, the school may be closed immediately due to small problems, and it may also cause dissatisfaction among some students. Participating in the above puppet positions was also to cope with the environment in various aspects and protect the school property.</p>
<p>Presenting Evidence and Requesting Bail</p>
<p>The two defense lawyers, Hong Shihao and Mi Xitong, presented to the judge a letter from Chen Lifu regarding the defendant's return to Shanghai to continue maintaining the school, and documents from the International YMCA, the chairman of the St. John's University Board of Trustees, Yan Huiqing, and others to testify for the defendant. It proved how the defendant maintained the school at that time, mostly based on the intention of the Board of Trustees. The defendant also ran a wounded soldier hospital during the war and sent medical students to serve on the Yunnan-Burma Highway. The defense lawyers also asked the court to summon Zhang Sumin to testify at the next hearing, and to allow the defendant to be released on bail. The court ordered that the matter of bail should be submitted in writing for deliberation and decision by the collegial panel.</p>

<h3>Strengthening the Management of Department Stores and Shopping Malls: The Police Bureau Promulgates Six Regulations, Prohibiting the Sale of Tax-Evasive, Stolen Goods, and Ordering All Shed Shopping Malls to Close</h3>
<p>[This newspaper reported] The authorities in this city previously ordered the banning of street vendors from September 1 to rectify the appearance of the city and facilitate traffic. Because the livelihoods of the vendors were at stake, they organized joint shopping malls, all of which were approved by the Bureau of Finance and the Bureau of Social Affairs. These joint shopping malls are neither company organizations nor partnership entities. The mall owners invest in renting houses, slightly renovate them, and then sublet the space of several square feet to vendors, charging each household a cabinet fee of 700,000 to 1 million yuan (each shopping mall accommodates about 100 vendors, and its one-time rental income is more than 100 million yuan). After investigation by the police bureau, although the establishment of these shopping malls does not hinder the appearance of the city and traffic, there are three malpractices: (1) The shopping malls are greedy for heavy profits, setting up too many cabinets, with narrow aisles, and customers are crowded and the order is chaotic. (2) The buildings and equipment are simple, and if an accident occurs, it is really unimaginable. (3) Tax-evading goods or stolen goods are inevitably sold here.</p>
<p>In order to prevent the above malpractices, the police bureau has formulated the following management measures: (1) Notify the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Bureau of Finance that all applications for the establishment of such vendor shopping malls should first be investigated and approved by the police bureau before they are allowed to operate. (2) Stipulate that the cabinet stalls and aisles of each shopping mall should not be less than five meters to avoid congestion. (3) Each shopping mall should add fire exits and install fire-fighting equipment to prevent accidents. (4) The inside of the mall must be kept clean at all times, and it must not sell police-violating, tax-evading, and stolen goods. (5) All shed shopping malls in the shed restricted construction area will be ordered to close down (such as the Nanhai Shopping Mall, the buildings are all made of wooden frames, cloth awnings, flower paper, and coarse mud), (6) Please ask the Bureau of Social Affairs to reasonably restrict the rent of the cabinet households.</p>

<h3>Landlords Are Unwilling to Pay Property Tax and Insist That Tenants Pay It; The Bureau of Finance Has Asked the Court for Interpretation</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Council decided that the property tax for this autumn and winter will be collected at 10% of the actual rent and borne by the landlord, first collected from the tenant, and then deducted from the rent by the tenant, and also passed the collection of the municipal construction donation, the calculation method is to deduct the property tax payable by the landlord from a lump sum, and the remaining amount is the municipal construction donation, which is borne by the residents. The Bureau of Finance has been following this procedure since this month, and the collection situation is very good. However, because the amount collected is the total amount of the property tax and the municipal construction donation, and both are paid by the tenant in advance, and the property tax in Shanghai has always been borne by the tenant, some landlords now insist on the original situation and do not pay the property tax, creating a situation where both donations must be borne by the tenant, which is unfair. The Bureau of Finance has asked the court for a legal interpretation on its behalf, and it is said that a reply will be issued soon.</p>
<h3>Pianist John Lewis Will Perform at the Lyceum Today</h3>

<h3>Two Merchants Involved in Corruption in Road Construction Were Sentenced; The Human Aspect Seems Unfair; The Hardware Industry Association Made Some Explanations</h3>
<p>Eight members of the Hardware Industry Association were implicated in a corruption case in road construction and were each sentenced to three and a half years in prison. The association hosted the press yesterday afternoon to explain that the government's anti-corruption punishment regulations were promulgated in Chongqing in 1943. Shanghai merchants were not aware of this law, and it is customary in Shanghai business to take commissions and accept gifts. Government laws regard this as corruption. According to the regulations, the minimum sentence is seven years, but this time it was reduced by half. The eight members are the heads of eight hardware stores. If these people are imprisoned, they will have to stop doing business. The employees and their families in each store, usually ranging from dozens to hundreds of people, will also lose their jobs and face livelihood problems. It does not seem fair to say that this is humane.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor, I read in your newspaper issue of October 12th, page 5, a news item with the headline "Heavy Reward for Receiving 3,000 Taels of Gold, Awarding Over 2,700 Taels in Bonuses; Enemy Property Handling Bureau Announces Account," which stated, "The enemy and puppet property handling bureau has basically completed the seizure and impoundment of traitors' properties to date. Regarding gold, the Shanghai area has received a total of 3,020 taels, 6 mace, and 7.8 fen. However, a portion of this was used by the former Military Intelligence Bureau to pay secret reporting bonuses, totaling 2,747 taels, 2 mace, 8 fen, and 4 li. The handling bureau's net receipt was 273 taels, 3 mace, and 9.4 fen," etc. Upon investigation, the former Shanghai office of the Military Intelligence Bureau handled the confiscation of properties of Chinese traitors, including movable and immovable properties, divided into (1) real estate, (2) bills, (3) stocks, (4) ornaments, (5) gold, silver, and currency, (6) furniture, (7) other items. In June, based on the lowest possible estimated value, the total amount of traitor property was calculated to be 5,229,700,000 yuan. According to the bureau's announcements of November 6th and December 10th of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), regarding methods of rewarding secret reporting of traitor property, 500 million yuan was allocated to the original informants as secret reporting bonuses. This allocated bonus at the time was converted into gold at the market price, totaling 2,905 taels of gold. This represents the total secret reporting bonus for the traitor property confiscated in the Shanghai area by the former Shanghai office of the Military Intelligence Bureau, not the so-called "Heavy Reward for Receiving 3,000 Taels of Gold, Awarding Over 2,700 Taels in Bonuses." (2) On November 6th, the article "Traitor Sheng's Child Interrogated Yesterday" stated that I (Sheng) "All of my property has been sealed by the Military Intelligence Bureau, it can be said to be completely confiscated. Some time ago, I saw in the Shanghai newspaper a list of my property, 62 gold bars have become 47 bars. I request the court to send a letter to the Military Intelligence Bureau and the Enemy Property Bureau." Upon investigation, the former Shanghai office of the Military Intelligence Bureau confiscated 61 large gold bars (approximately 10 taels each) and 10 small gold bars (1 tael each) from traitor Sheng (equivalent to 1 large bar), totaling 62 bars. These were recorded and transferred to the bureau long ago and have not been reduced. The property list of traitor Sheng can be used as evidence. Therefore, the above two news items do not match the facts. Accordingly, we request that you correct these reports.

<h3>Social Services: Reader Consultation</h3>
<p>Legal Questions</p>
<p>(1) Forcing the Redemption of Old Property</p>
<p>Question from Zhonghe Township Office, Nanhui: A owns a piece of land that was absolutely sold to B in November of the 28th year of the Republic (1939). In August of the 30th year (1941), B exchanged the land with C's land. After B's death, B's wife absolutely sold the exchanged land to D. Now, A's son (who joined the ××× army in the 30th year) wants to redeem the sold land from B's side at the original price. Please advise: (1) Since A's land has already been absolutely sold to B, can A's son redeem it based on his status as an active-duty soldier? (2) Can an active-duty soldier redeem sold land at the original price? (3) If redemption is possible, what are the procedures? (4) If D does not agree to the redemption, what can be done? (5) If both B and D do not agree to the redemption, if A's son uses force to coerce redemption or sues in court, will it be effective? (6) If B and D do not agree to the redemption, will any disputes that arise in between be an obstacle?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Cao Yaxia] (1) A has the right to freely dispose of his property and has already legally sold it. A's son cannot redeem the land. (2) No. (3) Impossible. (4) No remedy. (5) Ineffective. (6) No obstacle.</p>
<p>(2) Goodwill Issues</p>
<p>Question from Yingmu Weijian: I recently partnered with a friend to form a trading company engaged in import and export trade. The partnership agreement stipulates: "Goodwill will not be valued, but all transactions resulting from goodwill in the future, regardless of their nature, shall allocate 10% of the total net profit of each transaction as compensation for goodwill. Transactions unrelated to goodwill shall have no right to enjoy this compensation. The goodwill compensation is stipulated for a term of five years. If the company dissolves due to any reason within the term, the company's trademark, customer agents, and file documents shall all be unconditionally handed over to me. After the five-year term expires, the goodwill compensation stipulated in this article will terminate." (1) Does the aforementioned provision simply refer to the trademark or does it also include all new and existing customers? (2) Is the net profit from transactions resulting from the company's reputation also included in my goodwill compensation? (3) Do transactions that occur with the company due to other relationships refer to "transactions unrelated to goodwill not included in this example" or is there another meaning? (4) Does the aforementioned provision adequately express the significance of my rights? (5) If a shareholder is untrustworthy and causes me to suffer losses, what method should I use to deal with it?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Cao Yaxia] (1)(2)(3)(4) Current Chinese law does not have any provisions regarding "goodwill." Its content and scope should be clearly defined or interpreted by the parties involved when drafting the contract. Sir Lord Justice Lindley in England defined goodwill in a certain case as "including everything that increases the value of a business, such as location, name, reputation, patrons, related business, or any such circumstances, and others that I cannot think of," which can be used as a reference. (5) You can legally request compensation.</p>

<h3>Suppressing Oil Prices: City Government to Hold Meeting Today; Registration of Retailers Ends Today; Oil Price Evaluation Committee Postponed to Next Monday</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's report] Mayor Wu, in order to discuss cracking down on the black market for cooking oil, will convene representatives from oil mills, grain and oilseed cake businesses, grain and oilseed cake retail businesses, and the Social Affairs Bureau, China Vegetable Oil Factory, etc., at 10:00 AM today in the city government conference room for talks.</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau originally scheduled to convene the Oil Price Evaluation Committee at 2:00 PM today, but it has been learned that it has been postponed to next Monday.</p>
<p>The Grain and Oilseed Cake Retail Business Association will regularly allocate 36,000 dan of low-priced cooking oil per month starting next week, so it has been handling the registration of cooking oil retail stores throughout the city (including suburban areas such as Wusong and Jiangwan) since the 14th. Today is the last day for registration, and all unregistered retailers should quickly go to register. In addition, it is said that the total number of registrations in the past two days has reached more than 700.</p>
<p>Yesterday's market price of raw oil was not much different from before, but the trend was still relatively stable, and transactions were scattered. Private factories, such as Dayouyu and Dachangxin, have allocated more than 200 dan of soybean oil, directly allocating it to retailers for door-to-door sales at negotiated prices.</p>
<p>According to the decision made at the previous meeting convened by Mayor Wu, private oil mills have been selling their stored oil to the market at limited prices every day in recent days, and have sold all of it. As for the joint distribution of 12,000 dan per month by each factory according to the current production volume, it is decided that on Monday (the 18th) of next week, manufacturers can apply for a 40 million yuan loan for those who sell 1,000 dan to the market. The Shanghai Municipal Bank's 500 million yuan cooking oil loan will allocate loan amounts to members of its oil mill association as follows: (1) Dayouyu, 160 million yuan, (2) Dachangxin, 100 million yuan, (3) Dadexin, 80 million yuan, (4) Changde, 65 million yuan, (5) Shunyu, 60 million yuan, (6) Dasheng, 20 million yuan, (7) Weimin, 15 million yuan. The association has prepared documents according to the loan amounts applied for by the above members and submitted them to the Municipal Bank for approval. As for the guarantee and collateral procedures for each factory, the association plans to have Wang Shixin, the managing director, personally visit the bank authorities next Monday morning to discuss the matter.</p>
<h3>City Authorities Assist Stock Exchange in Investigating Black Market for Securities; Account Books to be Checked by Supervisors; Responsible Persons to be Summoned for Testimony</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the stock market trading firms in this city have been rampant, and the trend has intensified. Conducting matched trades is nothing more than a gambling transformation, violating the Stock Exchange Law and disrupting finance. The business of the stock exchange and brokers are affected, and the government is paying close attention to this. When President Song of the Executive Yuan came to Shanghai, he ordered Mayor Wu to severely crack down on it. Yesterday (the 15th) at around 11:00 AM, the city government ordered the police and social bureaus to select personnel to cooperate with the Shanghai Stock Exchange Supervisor's Office of the Ministry of Finance and Economy and personnel from the stock exchange to take action and investigate more than ten non-brokerage firms engaged in black market securities trading outside the Stock Exchange Building. All personnel present were questioned, filled out records, and signed by the interviewees. All telephone numbers were copied, and the identities of the other parties were identified. All account books were taken to the Supervisor's Office for inspection, and the responsible persons will be summoned to find a guarantor and sign a statement promising never to do it again. It is reported that since there are still many firms engaged in black market securities trading, the city government will continue to investigate thoroughly to eradicate the practice.</p>
<h3>Western Merchants Continue to Buy; Public Bonds Gradually Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, public debt prices rose because Western merchants were still entrusting Office 333 to purchase them, and their appetite was relatively healthy, absorbing more than 4 million yuan. The upward trend was stimulated. Unified Class C bonds opened at 1,400 yuan, then fell to 1,360 yuan. When sellers stopped selling, the buying wind gradually increased, and gradually rose back to 1,640 yuan before stabilizing. As a result, compared to the previous close, Classes A, B, D, and G all rose by 150 yuan, Unified Class C bonds rose by 230 yuan, and Unified Class E bonds rose by 230 yuan. The transaction volume was no less than 8 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>The difficulty of rice market supply has not decreased, and there are still more than 12,000 shi registered, but store consumption has been maintained. As the weather turns cold, retail sales have increased compared to wholesale. Northern japonica rice continued to rise by more than 1,000 yuan, and southern japonica rice rose by another 1,200 yuan. Indica rice rose by 1,000 yuan. High-quality white glutinous and brown glutinous rice have increased by varying amounts from 1,200 yuan to 2,300 yuan. Due to a shipment of 6,000-7,000 bags of Northeastern soybeans arriving in Shanghai today, people's confidence softened, and it entered a state of fatigue again, reduced by 1,000 yuan. After the decline in flour transportation costs, digestion moved slightly and rose by 200 yuan. Bran is still weak, soybean cake is down by 100 yuan, and the arrival and sale of wheat are both scarce. Peanut kernels from other ports and this street have become less willing to take in goods, falling by 3,400 yuan, forming a situation of sudden rises and sudden falls. Sesame seeds are scarce and strong, rising by 1,000 yuan. Red sorghum has decent brewery intake and remains stable. Corn from Qingdao moved slightly, and high-quality goods are expected to rise. Medium-quality goods are average. The oil market has not opened up, and allocation of door-to-door sales will be re-allocated tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Medium and Fine White Sugar Spot Appears</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market prices rebounded by 3,400 yuan due to the shortage of spot medium and fine white sugar. The association's quoted price for medium and fine white sugar was initially 137,500 yuan and later 140,000 yuan. Raw red sugar rose from 116,700 yuan to 119,000 yuan. Shantou traders quoted 117,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan for new deliveries and 107,800 yuan for old Huanggang green, and 115,000 yuan for cotton red.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Allocation: China Trust Strictly Audits</h3>
<p>Since the allocation of artificial silk by the China Trust Bureau last month, it has reached eight times. The 14th was the date of the ninth allocation. The bureau still followed the original method and allocated 492 boxes according to the quantity applied for by each factory. The number of electric silk weaving industries applying this month is more than last month, and the quantity has also increased, requesting to purchase more than 3,000 boxes. After the bureau's review, 334 households were approved, and 2,322 boxes were approved. According to the person in charge of the bureau: Although the electric silk weaving industry requested a lot this month, after checking the registration cards, the number of electric machines did not match the required quantity, and there was obviously an overstatement, which was naturally reduced. In addition, the bureau decided to allocate artificial silk to the weaving tape industry and the artificial silk association according to the amount required, but there are 77 weaving tape industries, and the request is for more than 500 boxes. According to the bureau's investigation, it is believed that dozens of boxes are sufficient, so it has not yet been approved and will be submitted to the next committee for resolution. The bureau also did not allocate the quantity reported by each member of the artificial silk association, which did not list the application quantity and sales area.</p>
<h3>Insufficient Quota Drives Fine Yarn Prices Wildly; Cotton Cloth Prices Close to Manufacturing Costs</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's report] Yesterday's yarn market was still extremely firm, with 20-count yarn continuing to rise by 35,000, and buying and selling were not enthusiastic. For example, Extra Double Horse was priced from 2,320,000 to 2,350,000, and ordinary Double Horse Jincheng also traded at 2,156,000. The 42-count yarn, because the allocated yarn is not suitable for application, various weaving factories are searching for it on the market, and the price has jumped by 200,000. For example, the Blue Phoenix brand has been traded at more than 3,700,000, and the supply is still short.</p>
<p>Cloth market transportation costs are rising daily, and have approached manufacturing costs. Recently, due to the tight yarn supply, general yarn factories are willing to exchange cloth for yarn, and cloth factories are also willing to barter. In short, inventory is scarce, and as soon as demand moves, prices rise. As soon as it stagnates, it flows downstream. Yesterday, high-quality fine cloth was priced at 87,500 yuan, and other colorful balls and blue chickens also rose by 3,400 yuan, etc. However, serge did not rise much in price.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Initially Level, Then Rise; US Dollar Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, gold was extremely stable before 11:30 am. Near noon, news of buying assistance spread, and buying immediately increased. The morning opening was 2,453,000, and it was extremely stable after opening. Although the demand was strong, there was also pressure. The high price was 2,458,000, and it immediately fell back, gradually retreating to within 2,440,000 before stabilizing. The Central Bank allocated 100 bars at a price of 2,440,000. After 10 o'clock, it dragged on in a stable state, always hovering around 2,450,000, with no other changes. It was delayed until after 11:30 am when buying suddenly increased. At noon, it rose to 2,490,000 before slightly falling back. In the afternoon, the next-day delivery went from level to firm, and was pushed from around 2,475,000 to 2,490,000 again. People's hearts are extremely easily excited. As a result, it closed 42,000 higher than the previous close. Gold ornaments rose to 260,000, silver ingots to 3,600, silver dollars continued to rise, unofficial silver interest rates were stable, and interest rates were still around 12%.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies continued to flourish. The black market US dollar started at 4,380 yuan and gradually improved, rising to above 4,500 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, there were widespread rumors in the market that the government would be reorganized, and new purchases poured in. Finally, it rose to above 4,700 yuan, continuing to rise by more than half a percentage point compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars rose from around 900 yuan in the early morning to above 920 yuan, also rising by 30 yuan. Hong Kong exchange rates rose to around 910 yuan, Indian exchange rates to 1,100 yuan, and British exchange rates to 14,700 yuan. US exchange rates remained unchanged. Transactions were mostly in Hong Kong exchange rates, and the rest were sluggish.</p>
<h3>News of Buying Assistance Spreads; Chinese Stocks Turn Upward in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were even more miserable yesterday morning. Apart from a little arbitrage trading in the banking sector, there was little interest inside and outside the industry. After opening, people were timid and scrambling to cut losses, and the market immediately fell sharply. After 10 o'clock, Xinhua and others took advantage of the low prices to arbitrage, but in terms of delivery, they could not withstand the selling pressure from current delivery, and the firm trend was difficult to sustain. Halfway through, it almost became the world of sellers, and it fell again and again. After Tongyi reached the limit down, it stabilized slightly. "Delivery" Yonggong took the lead in breaking the limit down record. Although there was a temporary rebound from short covering after 11:30, there were few supporters, and the upward trend was temporary. Near noon, the atmosphere became even worse, and under the circumstances of liquidation, it fell to low prices. As a result, compared to the previous close, mature stocks such as Yongsha, Meyer, Xinyi, Jingfu, and Qinxing each fell by about 10%, Xinguang only fell by half a percent, and cold stocks such as Rongfeng, Tongyi, Huochai Gongsi, and Lian each fell by more than 10%, and the rest all fell slightly. Delivery Yongsha fell by 5%, and Yonggong fell by 15% (only the selling price of Zhu was obtained, so the stock exchange only had a price of 217 yuan, and no record of 204 yuan. The rest all fell by about 10%. In the afternoon, it was heard that the stock exchange searched many off-exchange trading firms in the yarn and cloth building, coupled with the news of the reorganization of the National Government, which stimulated the largest buying wind, and major matching households were keen to cover shorts. The widespread buying wind on the table was even more intense because it was a week later for delivery, and prices continued to rise. Apart from the sluggish stocks, almost all the others closed at high prices. As a result, compared to the previous close, hot stock Yongsha rose alone, and the rest all fell slightly. Xinyi was still level, and cold stock Xinya was still stable. The rest ranged from a slight decrease to a fall of no more than 10%. Delivery Yongsha was level, Meyer, Xinyi, Jingfu, and Xinguang fell slightly, and Yonggong had previously fallen to the limit down in the morning, but there were no transactions. In the afternoon, there were no listings, making it difficult to count. The off-exchange stocks were relatively peaceful.</p>
<p>Since foreign stocks only opened for trading in the morning, under adverse circumstances, each stock had fewer sellers and more buyers, and no one maintained them. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yisha and British-American fell slightly, Steel Industry Wheelock fell by half a percent, and Yeguang, Paper Industry, Yipi, and Aviation each fell by less than 10%.</p>
<h3>Ningxia Wool: 1,000 Yuan per Jin; Freight Costs 1,800 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Nanjing News] Mr. Qiao Senrong, a representative from Ningxia Province attending the National Federation of Industry and Commerce, said that the province's production is mainly wool and salt. Due to inconvenient transportation, it is difficult to transport them out. Currently, the market price of ordinary wool in Ningxia Province is 1,000 yuan per jin. If transported to Tianjin or Shanghai, the freight cost per jin would increase by 1,800 yuan. Recently, Australian wool arriving in Shanghai is cheap and of good quality, so Ningxia wool merchants do not see any profit in exporting to Shanghai and are unwilling to export wool.</p>

<h3>Cotton Cloth Merchants Must Re-register</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's report] There are more than 1,300 cotton cloth merchants registered with the Business Department of the China Textile Construction Company. Now, the Textile Construction Company has announced that the number of requests from various manufacturers to change registration and exchange seals has been increasing daily. For the purpose of reorganization, a special notice was issued yesterday requiring each merchant to bring the original seal to the Investigation Section of the Business Department of the company before the 25th of this month to collect a blank registration card and re-register. Those who fail to do so by the deadline will be deemed to have voluntarily given up.</p>
<h3>Fine Yarn Profitable; Firewood Cotton Has Difficulty Finding a Way Out</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's report] Firewood cotton produced in Pudong, this city, has recently lacked buyers. The association believes that the purchase of firewood cotton is greatly related to the livelihoods of cotton farmers in Pudong. They have submitted a request to the Shanghai Cotton Business Association in this city, asking them to request that each yarn factory purchase it on their behalf. The industry association convened a board of directors meeting yesterday afternoon and decided to send a letter to Mayor Wu, asking him to persuade each yarn factory not to specialize in spinning with foreign cotton because fine yarn is profitable. It is also hoped that they can spin more of the 16-count or lower yarns in order to use as much domestic cotton as possible and maintain the livelihoods of cotton farmers. In addition, the industry association believes that the reports on the market prices of various raw cottons in this city are either not uniform or accurate. They now plan to designate a certain time to report the market prices of each grade of raw cotton to the Shanghai Radio Station in this city every day for reference by all sectors.</p>
<h3>Before the Commencement of Commodity Tax: Fixed Orders and Inventory are Tax-Exempt</h3>
<p>After the commencement of the new taxes on seven items such as wheat flour and cement, all of the above-mentioned goods will be subject to tax in accordance with regulations when they leave the factory. However, there is some doubt as to whether manufacturers should pay taxes on orders accepted before the commencement of the tax that have not yet left the factory after the commencement of the tax. The Commodity Tax Bureau of this city recently received instructions from the Ministry of Finance that manufacturers are allowed to report such orders to the commodity tax authority for investigation and verification within three days of the publication of the commodity tax authority's announcement, along with the order contract and legal documents, and to check the relevant account books. They are allowed to leave the factory tax-free before the end of November of this year. Applications or tax exemptions will not be allowed after the deadline. As for the inventory that has been sold on the market before the commencement of the tax, it was previously stipulated that it would be tax-free for local sales by the end of October of this year. Now, the deadline has been extended to November. However, the above-mentioned fixed orders and inventory that are transported out or into other ports shall still be taxed in accordance with regulations.</p>
<h3>Export Invoices</h3>
<p>Request for Exemption from Affixing Stamp Tax Stamps: Trade Association Appeals</p>
<p>It is reported that the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau recently designated foreign exchange banks to check whether the invoices attached by export merchants when applying for foreign exchange settlement have been affixed with stamp tax stamps at the rate of 3 per thousand. If they have not been affixed, the banks must transfer them to the bureau for legal action. The China Import and Export Trade Association believes that the domestic commodity prices, transportation, and interest rates are continuing to rise, and the export situation is extremely unfavorable. The payment of stamp tax on export invoices will increase costs even more. In addition, stamp tax has already been paid when export merchants purchase goods from various places. Now, because of operating exports, they have to bear huge expenses again, which involves double taxation. Therefore, it appealed to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs on behalf of them yesterday, requesting that they be allowed to be exempted from affixing stamps.</p>
<h3>Opinions of the American Tung Oil Expert: Supply Only One-Third of Demand, Improve Quality and Reduce Exploitation</h3>
<p>Dr. Curry, an American member of the Sino-American Agricultural Technology Group and a tung oil expert, was dispatched to China in June of this year to investigate the current state of tung oil production. Yesterday, he arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing and will fly back to the United States. Before his departure, he shared his opinions on improving China's tung oil industry with reporters: (1) Currently, China's tung oil production has sharply decreased to only half of its pre-war level. It is estimated that this year's output will be no more than 60,000 metric tons, equivalent to approximately 133 million pounds. The main reason for this reduction is the low price of tung oil during the war, making tung tree planting unprofitable. (2) Tung oil is the best drying oil. If prices are reasonable, the market is stable, and the supply is normal, the world's consumption could reach 500 million pounds (approximately 227,700 metric tons). This year's global tung oil production is estimated to be no more than 155 million pounds, only a little less than one-third of global consumption. China must rapidly increase production to meet global demand. If the current supply shortage persists, tung oil's industrial applications will gradually be taken over by other drying oils and substitutes. (3) Tung oil production is scattered, making it impossible to use new extraction methods. The quality is inconsistent, and adulteration is common. In the future, production must be centralized to reduce costs and improve quality. (4) Tung trees are not forest products. They should not be left to grow on their own but should be treated as horticultural crops, managed using methods similar to fruit tree cultivation. This includes selecting superior varieties, focusing on asexual reproduction, planting in fertile soil, weeding, fertilizing, and controlling pests and diseases to maximize their productive capacity. (5) Tung oil is currently mostly produced in mountainous areas, making transportation difficult. There are too many intermediaries, and tung farmers' profits are too small. It is necessary to improve transportation and marketing, reduce freight costs, and decrease the exploitation by intermediaries to encourage farmers to expand tung tree planting. Dr. Curry concluded with a firm tone, stating that in the next five years, increasing the quantity of tung oil should be prioritized over improving its quality. Production increases must be rapid and planned, ensuring that production, manufacturing, transportation, and marketing are integrated.</p>
<h3>The Price of White Coal Declines: More Arriving, Sales Slow</h3>
<p>Since the market price of white coal lump coal has fallen, sales have remained difficult to expand. Sellers are unwilling to further lower prices due to cost considerations, unless there are large-volume buyers who can negotiate prices, about 50,000 to 100,000 yuan lower than the market price. As deliveries continue to arrive, the market is quite weak. Yesterday, more than 2,000 tons of Hongji lump coal were shipped from Nanchang and are currently being unloaded at a warehouse of the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee in Pudong. Additionally, several truckloads of Jiaozuo lump coke have arrived at the McGann Road Station, with each truck carrying approximately 20 to 30 tons. Meanwhile, the bituminous coal market remains brisk due to the scarcity of allocated goods and strong demand from factories. Traders are bidding up prices for allocated goods, with premiums reaching 4.424 million yuan per unit.</p>
<h3>Amendments to the Commodity Tax Regulations</h3>
<p>(Passed by the Legislative Yuan on November 11) (Continued)</p>
<p>Article 4. The commodity tax rates are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Cigarettes: 100% ad valorem tax.</p>
<p>(2) Tobacco: 30% ad valorem tax.</p>
<p>(3) Imported wine and beer: 100% ad valorem tax.</p>
<p>(4) Matches: 20% ad valorem tax.</p>
<p>(5) Sugar: 25% ad valorem tax.</p>
<p>(6) Cotton yarn: 5% ad valorem tax.</p>
<p>(7) Wheat flour: 2.5% ad valorem tax.</p>
<p>(8) Cement: 15% ad valorem tax.</p>
<p>(9) Tea: 10% ad valorem tax.</p>
<p>(10) Furs: 15% ad valorem tax.</p>
<p>(11) Tin foil and spirit money: 60% ad valorem tax.</p>
<p>(12) Beverages: 20% ad valorem tax.</p>
<p>(13) Cosmetics: 45% ad valorem tax.</p>
<p>Article 5. The taxable value of goods subject to commodity tax shall be based on the average wholesale price of the nearby market of the place of production over a three-month period. The aforementioned average wholesale price shall include (a) the dutiable value of the goods, (b) the amount of the original commodity tax paid, which is the dutiable value of the goods multiplied by the tax rate, and (c) the cost of transporting the goods from the place of production to the nearby market, which is set at 10% of the dutiable value.</p>
<p>Average wholesale price in the nearby market of the place of production × 100 ÷ (100 + the commodity tax rate + cost of transportation from the place of production to the nearby market, i.e., 10) = assessed dutiable value</p>
<p>For the convenience of tax collection, the Ministry of Finance may, at its discretion, adopt a tiered tax system for goods subject to commodity tax. The tiered tax calculation methods shall be determined by the Ministry of Finance. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Caustic Soda Plummets: Unprofitable for Out-of-Town Sales</h3>
<p>The price of caustic soda plummeted by 100,000 yuan per barrel yesterday. According to industry insiders, this is because the price in other areas is similar to that in Shanghai, so out-of-town merchants have no intention of exporting. Various parties are selling off their stocks at high prices to obtain cash, confirming that the recent surge was mostly speculative. Further declines are possible. Bleaching powder and sulfur are arriving.</p>
<h3>Sales of Subsidized Flour Narrowing: Hoping for Reduced Allocation Prices</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to flour industry sources, the various flour mills in the city can now produce 30,000 bags of flour per day. Of these, 12,000 bags are allocated to flour merchants for subsidized sales, while the remaining 18,000 bags are mostly sold by the flour mills themselves on the black market. As a result, the black market price of flour has fallen to 19,200 yuan per bag in recent days. However, the subsidized flour still costs 20,500 yuan per bag. Therefore, the sales of subsidized flour are narrowing, and the number of people going to purchase it daily has decreased to 6,000 bags. Therefore, there is a strong hope that the authorities can reconsider reducing the price of allocated flour.</p>

<h3>Commemorating World Student Day: Rallies to Be Held in Nanjing and Shanghai Tomorrow, Telegram to the World Student Association to Express Respect</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Tomorrow (the 17th) is "World Student Day." During World War II, after the German army occupied Czechoslovakia, it suppressed the patriotic movement of Czech students through massacres and arrests. Starting on November 17, 1939, students and professors in Prague and other major Czech cities were subjected to mass killings, resulting in thousands of deaths. The remaining students were mostly detained in concentration camps, and all higher education institutions were closed. The World Student Congress designated this day as World Student Day in 1941. The first World Student Day commemoration was held in New York on November 17, 1942, with student representatives from thirty Allied countries signing and issuing a joint declaration. A commemoration was held in London in 1943, and China held a commemoration in Chongqing in the same year. In 1944, the British National Union of Students decided to hold another commemoration in London, and Chinese youth also held a commemoration in Chongqing. This year, the fourth Chinese commemoration will be held in Nanjing and Shanghai tomorrow, and a telegram will be sent to the World Student Association in the name of the conference to express respect, strengthen the unity of world students, and promote lasting world peace.</p>
<p>Another report: At 9 a.m. tomorrow, students from various schools in the city will hold a World Student Day commemoration at the Municipal Gymnasium. In addition to students from various universities and colleges in the city, students from the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and other Allied countries in Shanghai will also participate. According to reliable sources, Mayor Wu, Wang Chonghui, Zhu Jingnong, Gu Yuxiu, Li Ximou, and others will attend and deliver speeches. A grand parade will be held after the meeting.</p>

<h3>Flora Sinensis to Begin Compilation</h3>
<p>[Reported by the Central News Agency, Beiping, on the 15th] Botanist Hu Xiansu, director of the Fan Memorial Institute of Biology, arrived in Beiping from Shanghai the day before yesterday. He stated that the recent meeting of the Academia Sinica approved a letter from Dr. Elmer Drew Merrill of Harvard University requesting the Institute of Botany of Academia Sinica, the Institute of Botany of the Beiping Academy, and the Fan Memorial Institute of Biology to jointly compile "Flora Sinensis" with the United States. This work will take more than ten years. Hu also discussed with the Central Agricultural Experiment Station of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry the compilation of "Illustrated Manual of Chinese Forest Trees," which will be edited by Hu. This book will be an extremely important reference book for China, as the United States only has over 600 species of plants, while China has over 2,000 species. The new pine and cypress family plant discovered by him in Shuangqing and Wanxian, similar to the American "Sequoia," is named Metasequoia, with a lifespan of approximately 2,000 years. This Metasequoia tree has been cut in half but is still 34 meters high. This type of plant completely disappeared from Europe, America, Japan, Sakhalin Island, and other places due to the Ice Age millions of years ago.</p>
<h3>Coffin to Lecture in Shanghai: From the 18th to the 22nd</h3>
<p>World-renowned scholar Dr. H.S. Coffin has come to China to lecture under the auspices of the American Cushwa Foundation.

<h3>Student Public Funding Issues: Unified Regulations Established</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau recently received instructions from the Ministry of Education regarding student public funding issues, establishing unified regulations. The main points are: All discharged youth soldiers who have been approved for distribution by the ministry, regardless of whether they originally received public funding, will be given full public funding, without being restricted by their original allocation. Those who have not been distributed by the Ministry of Education are not subject to this. For displaced youth whose family economic sources have been cut off, and who have obtained feasible proof documents, if verified to be true, the school may submit a special case to the ministry for approval to grant public funding outside the prescribed quota. The granting of public funding to distributed students in the various temporary university preparatory classes shall be handled in accordance with the prescribed methods.</p>

It is heard that all procedures have been completed, and each school concurrently operating a civil school can go to claim the funds starting tomorrow.</p>
<h3>UNESCO General Conference to Be Held in Paris: Representatives from Forty-Four Countries to Attend</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 15th] The General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is scheduled to convene here on November 19 and continue until December 10. Forty-four countries will participate, each sending five representatives. The Soviet Union has also been invited, but has not yet indicated its willingness to participate. Sweden and Switzerland have been invited to send observers.</p>
<p>Complete Permanent Form</p>
<p>One of the main goals of this conference is to complete the permanent form of the organization. Since its establishment in London last November, the organization has been operating on a temporary basis, with the temporary secretariat led by Dr. Huxley. At this conference, a Director-General with a six-year term will be elected, and a secretariat will be established. At the same time, the plans of the various departments of the organization will be discussed and approved. The main departments include education, natural sciences, social sciences, fine arts, literature, philosophy, mass communication (newspapers, radio, film), libraries, museums, news, and war-torn areas. The purpose of UNESCO is to promote the highest level of exchange of information, ideas, and inventions among scientists, educators, and intellectuals from various countries.</p>
<p>Prevent International Crises</p>
<p>The report to be submitted by the preparatory committee to the conference states that there are two ways to maintain peace in the modern world: one is to establish institutions to prevent war when international crises occur, and the other is to cultivate society so that crises do not arise. With the welfare of mankind as the greatest premise, respect and understanding between countries can be promoted. After World War I, emphasis was placed on the first method. After World War II, both methods have been given equal importance. The success of UNESCO is a prerequisite for the development of international relations. Today, people base their hopes for peace, prosperity, and a friendly world on such relations. This organization is an important tool for cultivating peace and preventing war. The evolution of modern tactics and the increasing degree of destruction of civilization have further increased the importance of this organization. Unless UNESCO and other organizations aimed at safeguarding human welfare are successful, we will not have the opportunity to understand the ability of human thought.</p>
<p>Arranged Commemorative Programs</p>
<p>To commemorate this UNESCO conference, Paris has organized a "UNESCO Month," in which cultural figures from twenty countries will participate. Symphony orchestras from Paris, Liège, Amsterdam, and Prague will perform in Paris. The Paris Opera will perform a special program, including performances of Chinese opera. In addition, there will be dance performances, lectures, art, science, and education exhibitions.</p>

<h3>Tense but Not Exciting: Black and White Loses to the Zheng Lun Team by One Point, 55 to 53, Black and White Women's Team Gets off to a Good Start</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In their second game last night, the Filipino-Chinese Black and White basketball team faced the strong Luoyang Zheng Lun team. After a 40-minute battle, Black and White unfortunately lost by a score of 55 to 53. In the first half, Black and White led by three points with a score of 25 to 22. The game was close, with the score difference remaining between two and three points. Only in the final minutes did Zheng Lun score consecutively, finally deciding the outcome of the game.</p>
<p>Equally Matched, Tough Fight</p>
<p>Last night's game can be described as evenly matched. Although the tension was high, there were not many exciting moments. Zheng Lun was less impressive than usual, with disorganized tactics and inaccurate shooting. Black and White was also relying on tough play, without showing much strategy. Therefore, all that was seen was both sides fighting hard and randomly shooting. Black and White's shooting was also not as accurate as Qunsheng, and the play was not as beautiful as Qunsheng's, which was quite disappointing. Neither side was confident of winning, which was not the state of a political party. While the Black and White men's team suffered a setback, the women's team got off to a good start and performed quite well.</p>
<p>Black and White Women's Team Gets off to a Good Start</p>
<p>At 5:45 p.m., the women's teams took the court. The Black and White women's team made its debut, facing off against the Qing Lian team. Before the game, the captains of both teams exchanged pennants. Xu Peizhen of Qing Lian opened the scoring, and Chen Yurun of Black and White responded in kind. At the end of the first quarter, Black and White led ten to eight. At the end of the first half, Black and White was far ahead with a score of 37 to 15. After the break, the game resumed. Wang Wuli and Jian Zhiguang of Qing Lian replaced Liu Huishan and Hu Yuru. However, Qing Lian became even more sluggish, while Black and White continued to play with great ease. At the end of the third quarter, Black and White led 44 to Qing Lian's 17. As a result, the Black and White women's team defeated Qing Lian 49 to 29, getting off to a good start.</p>
<p>Black and White Scores Qing Lian Scores</p>
<p>Chen Yurun 12 Xu Peizhen 6</p>
<p>Yang Xiuzhi 12 Sun Fengzhu 15</p>
<p>Chen Lihu 0 Liu Huishan 8</p>

<p>Ouyang Meilan 0 Jian Zhiguang 0</p>
<p>Ye Yiqing 0 Total 29</p>
<p>Cai Shuqiong 0</p>
<p>Total 49</p>
<p>Fierce Competition, Difficult to Separate</p>
<p>Following this, the Black and White men's team met the Zheng Lun team. Qu Honglu and Zheng Zhifang served as referees. Black and White fielded Chuan Yongxin, Guo Guoye, Cai Jin, Ye Kexi, and Lin Ziyi, while Zheng Lun fielded Qian Ruizhang, Tu Wenlong, Cai Zhongqiang, Wang Binghuan, and Liu Zhengjun. After the initial contact, a fierce competition unfolded. Cai Jin of Black and White was the first to score, and Tu Wenlong of Zheng Lun responded in kind. The score was tied again at 4 and 6. Zheng Lun's offense was fierce, but their shots were inaccurate. Black and White replaced Chuan Yongxin with Xiao Bingtuo. At the end of the first quarter, Pian Lun led 10 to 8. When the game resumed, Black and White tied the score. Qian Ruizhang of Pian Lun scored twice, again taking the lead. Lin Ziyi of Black and White scored on a free throw, tying the score at 15 to 15. The two sides were evenly matched and difficult to separate. The scores of both sides rose and fell, with a difference of one or two points. As a result of the first half, Black and White came from behind to lead 25 to 21.</p>
<p>Victory Decided in the Final Quarter</p>
<p>In the third quarter, the competition between the two sides became even more intense, and the battle situation was extremely tense. Tu Guanglong scored first, and Xiao Huatu broke through the blue with one hand. The two teams tied again, with each side scoring 37 points. When the score was tied at 37, Wang Binghuan of Zheng Lun was disqualified for his fifth foul, and Zhang Gengsheng entered the game. At the end of the third quarter, Black and White led by only one point, with a score of 40 to 39. In the final quarter, both sides fought with all their strength. General Guo Guoye of Black and White was also disqualified for his fifth foul, and Ye Kexi entered as a substitute. When the score was 43 to 40, Xiao Huatu left the court due to a hand injury, and Li Jinzao entered the game. Tu Wenlong and Liu Zhengjun of Zheng Lun made long shots and close shots, taking the lead with a score of 46 to 44 in an instant. However, Black and White kept pressing hard, and the score rose and fell. There were several ties, and when the statutory time ended, Zheng Lun defeated Black and White by a difference of two points with a score of 55 to 53.</p>

<h3>Hu Tigian, Director of the Jilin Education Department, Discusses Modern Culture in Northeast China: Expressing the Tenacity of the Chinese Nation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 14th] Hu Tigian, Director of the Jilin Education Department, told reporters that modern culture in Northeast China can be divided into three periods. The first period is the culture of the "Zhangbaoren" (Zhangbaoren means those in charge of the moneybags), which should be the Manchu Qing Dynasty and its final years up until the "September 18th" Incident. At that time, the local people and those who moved from Hebei and Shandong to the Songliao River basin were mostly engaged in various industries, all with Zhangbaoren who had foresight and creativity regarding their careers and environment. They were extremely important in developing the culture of Northeast China. This can be compared to the Jeffersonian figures of the American West development. The second period is the culture of "those who must be inspected" (this is a Japanese term, referring to those who were conquered but not yet willing to submit, and must be guarded against), which should be after the "September 18th" Incident. Since the "September 18th" Incident, the people of Northeast China had their hearts set on the motherland, and constantly resisted violence. The Japanese used the manpower and resources of Northeast China to carry out construction, but the essence of the culture did not change. This can be compared to the gray literature of the late Tsarist era in Russia. The third period is the culture of employees, which is since the victory. The great expression of various employees in Northeast China doing their best to preserve various constructions amidst the chaos. Their struggles of life and career, such as the railway workers in Jinzhou resisting those who set fires, and the preservation of the Xiaofengman Power Plant, are all prominent examples. This is truly a unique expression of the tenacity of the Chinese national character. Hu is from Changchun, studied sociology at the University of Chicago for five years, and previously served as the director of the law school at Guangzhou University.</p>

<p>Brief Reports on Civil Affairs</p>
<h3>Holders of Candidate Qualification Notices May Directly Apply for Certificates: Examination Committee Informs City Government to Notify Subordinates</h3>
<p>A letter from the Examination Committee of the Municipal Government stated that, after investigation, those who are qualified for civil service positions at the county level and who have passed the examination are, in accordance with the regulations on issuing documents of qualification and simultaneously recognizing qualifications for provincial and county civil service candidate examinations, issued a qualification notice by the committee with a qualification stamp on the document. Those who have previously passed the examination and requested qualification recognition, and have been approved by the Examination Yuan to be issued a notice, the qualification notice has the same validity as a qualification certificate. Since the implementation of this procedure, there has been an increasing number of people who have obtained the qualification notice and then applied to the committee for a qualification certificate. In order to adapt to this practical situation and encourage participation in qualification recognition, it has been approved by the Examination Yuan that those who hold the qualification notice from the committee and wish to exchange it for a certificate may submit the notice and a certificate fee of thirty yuan, plus postage according to the postal regulations for each registered mail item, directly to the Secretariat of the Examination Yuan for exchange.

<h3>White Sails and Green Waters, the Beautiful Scenery of Andong</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper in the Northeast, Han Qingtao, from a Telegram on the 9th</p>
<p>The clear waters of the Yalu River flow along the Sino-Korean border. Originating from Mount Paektu, it meanders for over two hundred li before flowing into the Yellow Sea. The sight of white sails and interconnected "rafts" forms a magnificent spectacle on the Yalu River.</p>
<p>Small boats can travel upstream to the Thirteen Gou area west of Changbai. Medium-sized boats travel between the upper and lower reaches of Andong. Large ships mostly anchor at Duoshi Island at the river's mouth. The Yalu River plays a significant role in navigation.</p>
<p>In the upper reaches of the Yalu River, from Linjiang to Changbai, the mountains are steep, and the peaks tower as high as eight hundred to one thousand meters. There are dense forests. According to Japanese estimates, the forest area on both banks is more than 162,600 miles, but unplanned logging has caused considerable damage. Merchants cut down trees and form rafts, some as long as a li, which float downstream to the Dajiang Bridge in Andong City. The peak season for rafting is from June to August. The banks of the river are piled high with timber, so Andong also has the title of "Timber Capital."</p>
<p>In addition to timber, which ranks first, the goods that float down from the upper reaches include soybeans, bean cakes, sorghum, corn, small red beans, and silkworm cocoons. The goods shipped from Andong City include cotton, silk, cloth, salt, flour, kerosene, matches, and other necessities for the people in the upper reaches. The cargo transportation between Andong and the estuary mainly consists of exports and imported fabrics. The Yalu River above Andong is frozen from late November to March of the following year.</p>
<p>During the Republic of China in 1943, the Japanese puppets built a dam to build the "Shuifeng" hydroelectric power plant, preventing rafts from reaching Andong City directly. Therefore, standing at the Yalu River Bridge, one can no longer see the large "rafts." In addition, the upper reaches of the Yalu River are still unstable, and all cargo transportation must wait until early summer next year!</p>
<p>The Unfrozen [Dadong Port]</p>
<p>The construction of "Dadong Port" during the enemy and puppet period was also a significant project worthy of attention. The port is located at the mouth of the Yalu River and is naturally formed. Once completed, it could become the only unfrozen good port in the Northeast. Behind the port is an area designated for a city with a population of one million and a large industrial zone, covering an area of 176 square kilometers, with the intention of creating a large industrial city.</p>
<p>General Du Yuming, in order to see the situation of Dadong Port, ordered the plane to fly south when he inspected the war situation in Andong City and flew back to Shenyang. The reporters accompanied him. The plane circled over Dadong Port. The sea was vast, and the Yalu River lost its green color and turned into a torrent of muddy water flowing into the sea. A string of small mountains extended into the sea, forming a good harbor and gateway, with a magnificent atmosphere. What was strange was that no construction work was seen.</p>
<p>The construction goal of Dadong Port was to allow ships with a deadweight of 4,000 tons and a draft of 7.4 meters to navigate freely at high tide, and to have wharves and warehouses sufficient for four cargo ships to load and unload simultaneously. A 24-kilometer-long railway was to be built from Dadong Port directly to Andong City. When completed, it could become an important port among the four major ports in the Northeast.</p>
<p>Mountains and Fields Full of Treasures</p>
<p>Andong, only the area along the river and sea in Andong City and County forms a narrow plain. The rest of the northwest is mostly mountainous, so mineral resources are abundant. The most famous are the iron ore in Huanren and Kuandian, which have already been mined extensively. Kuandian also has tungsten ore, which is planned to be mined. Fengcheng has lead mines. The mines are located in the Qingchengzi area, which was previously mined by the puppet "Manzhou Mining Qingchengzi Mining Office." The ore contains small amounts of silver and zinc, producing 12,000 tons of lead per month, making it one of the leading lead-producing areas in China. Andong has copper mines, which were mined by the puppet "Shimizu Mining Office." The copper content is 30%, and the monthly processing volume is 15 tons. In addition, the province also has various mineral resources such as asbestos, mica, magnetite, gold, silver, fluorite, limestone, and coal.</p>
<p>The former puppet Tonghua Province was assigned to Andong after the restoration, including Changbai, Fusong, Linjiang, Tonghua, Jian, Huinan, Jinchuan, Liuhe, and Mengjiang, which is another large mineral resource area. Iron, coal, gold, silver, copper, lead, cadmium, platinum, mercury, asbestos, mica, graphite, limestone, refractory clay, iron sulfide, etc. are all very abundant. It is said that the coal reserves account for 20% of the total reserves in the Northeast. During the puppet Manchukuo period, most of the coal and iron mines were developed by the "Dongbiandao Development Company." At the same time, iron was smelted in the mining areas. At that time, in addition to the Japanese-controlled coal mines, there were also 13 coal mines such as the Hunjiang Coal Mine, which were all under the jurisdiction of the "Tonghua Province Coal Mine Association" established in 1942 by the puppet Manchukuo. The main mineral resources developed by the Japanese "Dongbiandao Development Company" included the Dalizi Iron Mountain in Linjiang County, the Qidaogou Iron Mountain in Tonghua City, the Tiezichanzi Coal Mountain, the Wudaojiang Coal Mountain, the Yourengou Coalfield, and the Yantonggou Coal Mountain. Gold, silver, and placer gold are mostly found in the Yalu River area. Silver, copper, mica, and graphite mines are in Jian. Limestone is in Tonghua. Liuhe, Huinan, and Jinchuan are all vast limestone areas. Limestone is an essential raw material for the iron and steel industry. In the past, seven mines were opened. Today, the land is still unstable, and everything is expected in the future!</p>
<p>[Timber Capital] and [Forest Province]</p>
<p>Andong has the title of "Timber Capital." The former puppet Tonghua Province, which was assigned to Andong after the restoration, is also known as the "Forest Province." The forests extending from the foot of Mount Changbai to Huinan in the northwest are lush, forming a vast and verdant sea of trees. In addition, the original forests of Jingyuan have been mostly deforested due to arbitrary logging.</p>
<p>The railways that were just recovered by the National Army have been thoroughly destroyed by the Communist Army. The rails have been lost, and the sleepers have been burned. It takes a lot of effort to collect the rails, but without the wood, they cannot be laid. The route from Ye Baishou to Chifeng, the route from Shenyang to Hailong, and the section of the Pan'an line are all in this situation. Therefore, the number of sleepers needed is quite large and alarming!</p>
<p>The National Army has recovered Andong, and the problem of the lack of sleepers can be partially solved. At the same time, there will be materials for the support and scaffolding wood needed for mining. The Andong Provincial Government has sent the Director of the Construction Department and others to inspect the forest area between Huinan and Mengjiang for logging in order to restore traffic as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Fragrant Rice and Fat Fish</p>
<p>Andong, which is said to have a population of five million, contains more than 200,000 Japanese and Koreans. Now, most of the Japanese and Koreans have been repatriated, and only a few remain. In the past, the Japanese were the rulers, technicians, and merchants, and the Koreans mostly grew rice and served as accomplices. This time, when the National Army entered the city and General Du arrived in Andong for inspection, Korean men, women, and children held the eight-trigram national flags and lined up to welcome them, raising their hands and shouting long live.</p>
<p>Education in Andong has not developed reasonably because most of the area is located in closed mountainous areas. Among them, Andong City, Zhuanghe, Fengcheng, and Tonghua are relatively better. The lack of teachers, the lack of funding, and the low level of students are serious problems at present.</p>
<p>Farmers still account for the majority of the population. Andong's rice is very famous, especially in Fengcheng, where the rice produced is very delicious. There are also some fishermen because Andong City to Zhuanghe has about 300 miles of coastline, where shrimp, eels, hairtail, small shrimp, yellow croaker, and whitefish are abundant. During the puppet regime, it was planned to build a marine fishing port on Da Wujia Island in Zhuanghe and plant seaweed seedlings there in order to transplant abalone and shellfish. There are also many hunters and herbal medicine collectors active in the deep mountains. For example, Tonghua Province's famous specialty, medicinal ginseng, can produce 400,000 catties per year. There are also many animal skins, mountain products, and medicinal herbs. In addition, tussah silkworm breeding, silk reeling, and silk weaving are also very famous. There are many silk factories in Badaogou at the foot of Yuanbaoshan Mountain in Andong City.</p>
<p>In recent years, Andong Province's emerging industries have been quite developed. Automobiles, cement, shipbuilding, textiles, rubber, refining, and light metal industries all have good products. It is a pity that after the restoration, foreigners moved away, and the destruction by our own people is now unknown how to remedy.</p>
<p>Good Hot Springs and Wonderful Skiing</p>
<p>Andong's scenery is beautiful, and there are many special pleasures. "Wulongbei," which is located 40 miles northwest of Andong City on the Anshan-Andong line, is a large hot spring known as one of the three sisters along with "Tanggangzi" and "Xiongyuecheng" in southern Liaoning. It is said that Emperor Taizong of Tang once stationed and bathed here during his expedition to Goguryeo. In the past, the old "Manchurian Railway" operated it, and there were hotels such as Wulong Pavilion, Maintenance Hall, and Jule Pavilion, with comfortable facilities. In addition, there are private bathhouses such as Longquan Village and Shuiming Village. The spring water is colorless and transparent, with a daily output of 1,800 dan and a temperature of 70 degrees Celsius. It is very helpful for treating skin diseases, neuralgia, gastrointestinal diseases, anemia, etc. Fortunately, it was not destroyed by the Communist Army this time.</p>
<p>Tonghua is surrounded by mountains on all sides, and the amount of snow in winter is large and does not melt, making it a natural large ski resort. During the puppet regime, ski resorts such as Nanshan, Longquan, Jingshan, Huadianzi, and Yinchang were set up. In February 1943, the puppet regime also held a so-called "East Asia Skiing Competition" here. The ski resort has a large 45-meter jump platform and a practice field that can accommodate hundreds of people. Skiing men and women slide down the hillside from the top of the mountain, flying over highlands, valleys, rushing and jumping, forming a beautiful painting in a silver world.</p>

<h3>Inspection Notes on Chahar, Suiyuan: Inside and Outside the Great Wall (4)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Hang Zhou</p>
<p>Early Winter in Zhangjiakou</p>
<p>Without wind, the early winter in Zhangjiakou is still lovely. During our days in Zhangjiakou, the weather was said to be unusually good. Strolling on the smooth asphalt road, appreciating the swaying of the four legs of those behemoths from the desert - camels, and the strange movements of the humps, there is a rough poetic flavor. This is already Inner Mongolia, where Mongolians and Han people live together, and it is difficult to distinguish them. There are hundreds of Hui people here, adhering to their religious rules and rarely interacting with non-believers. They each make a living and have always lived in peace. There are hundreds of foreign religious people here, 90% of whom are White Russians who have now restored their Soviet nationality; in addition, there are people from Sweden, Norway, Belgium and other countries. The total population of Zhangjiakou, according to the latest survey, is 140,800 people.</p>
<p>Local order was restored within five days of the recovery. The 12th War Zone Headquarters has an organization called the "Provisional Political Affairs Committee," whose work is even more extensive and practical than the political department of the war zone. When Fu Zuoyi was appointed as the chairman of the Chahar Provincial Government, this committee was temporarily responsible for the administration of Chahar and Zhangjiakou before formally taking office. It operates simultaneously with the army, so there is no problem in the coordination of military and government affairs. Zhou Jun, the Secretary-General of the Provisional Political Affairs Committee, who once served as the Secretary-General of the Suiyuan Provincial Government, is currently serving as the acting mayor of Zhangjiakou and is said to be likely to be appointed as the Secretary-General of the Chahar Provincial Government. The Provisional Political Affairs Committee is a temporary organization, and it will end its work after the Chahar Provincial Government is organized.</p>
<p>Currently, among the work being carried out by the Provisional Political Affairs Committee, the handling of land issues is worthy of attention. The Provisional Political Affairs Committee formulates work guidelines based on the administration program of the pacification zone promulgated by the central government and with reference to the actual situation in the area. Among them, the methods for handling land issues are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Land handling committees shall be established in each county to investigate the current state of land, fairly handle land distribution and land rent disputes.</p>
<p>2. Landowners should submit land ownership certificates for land confiscated and liquidated by the Communist Party, and they shall be allowed to reclaim it without payment. If the land ownership certificate is lost, a written certificate from the Baojia head in charge and two neighboring landholders adjacent to the land shall be provided, and they shall be allowed to reclaim it without payment.</p>
<p>3. Cultivators who have obtained land distributed by the Communist Party shall continue to retain the right to use the land, but must pay rent to the landlord.</p>
<p>4. Landlords shall retain property rights, but must limit the number of mu according to regulations and implement a 25% rent reduction.</p>
<p>5. In order to implement the land policy of the Principle of People's Livelihood, the policy of "land to the tiller" should be gradually implemented. On the one hand, the number of mu of private land should be limited. On the other hand, the Farmers Bank should provide loans to farmers to purchase the land they need to cultivate.</p>
<p>6. Ownerless land shall be confiscated by the government. Land not owned by the landlord shall be temporarily kept by the government.</p>
<p>7. The government should centrally manage public land, ownerless land, and land exceeding the landlord's limit, or purchase it at a fixed price to be owned by the state or the public, and establish public farms, cooperative farms, or distribute it to returning officers and soldiers and the families of soldiers on expedition for cultivation.</p>
<p>In addition, the following provisional measures have been formulated for the handling of this year's harvested materials from land confiscated and distributed by the Communist Party in the recovered areas:</p>
<p>1. For land distributed by the Communist Party through liquidation, the property rights still belong to the original landlord, and the tenant retains the right to harvest, but must pay the original landlord 15% of the harvested materials or the equivalent in value.</p>
<p>2. The harvested materials from land confiscated by the Communist Party shall be handled in accordance with the following methods:</p>
<p>A. If the land confiscated by the Communist Party and cultivated by the Communist Party itself has a proven landlord, the original landlord shall be given 15% of the harvested materials or the equivalent in value, and the remainder shall go to the public.</p>
<p>B. If the land confiscated by the Communist Party is cultivated by farmers on behalf of the Communist Party, and there is a proven landlord, the tenant shall pay the original landlord 15% of the harvested materials or the equivalent in value, and the remainder shall go to the tenant.</p>
<p>C. If the land confiscated by the Communist Party has no landlord and is transferred to farmers for cultivation, the tenant shall pay 15% of the harvested materials or the equivalent in value to the public, and the remainder shall go to the tenant.</p>
<p>D. If the land confiscated by the Communist Party and cultivated by the Communist Party itself has no landlord, all the harvested materials shall go to the public.</p>
<p>These handling methods are fair and reasonable. As a result of the implementation, the expected disputes were resolved smoothly.</p>
<p>Due to the blockage of transportation, the post office has not yet delivered enough stamps. Sending letters in Zhangjiakou is like in the primitive way, with the recipient paying the postage. There are no market prices for gold and US dollars here. Among various commodities, cloth is the most expensive, and food is relatively cheap. As for the fur goods praised by people, and the delicious mushrooms, although the truly valuable ones have been plundered by the Communist Army, the merchants are hoarding the remaining goods, and a medium-quality fox fur coat has already been sold for 700,000 to 800,000 yuan.

<h3>Burmese Overseas Chinese Returning Home</h3>
<p>— Chen Shurong</p>
<p>Rangoon Dispatch, 15th</p>
<p>The rainy season in Burma is coming to an end. During these several months of rain, the Rangoon River's waters, due to the tidal waves of the sea, oscillate. In the morning light, they flow smoothly into the sea, and at sunset, they surge against the current. The riverside area has become an informal park. Overseas Chinese men and women often stroll and walk here, watching the rise and fall of the tides and admiring the grandeur of the warships anchored in the river's heart. However, the question weighing heavily on the minds of the Overseas Chinese is: When will sea routes reopen? When will families separated by the war be reunited? When will those who survived the fall of Rangoon, snatched from the jaws of the tiger, be able to travel around the beautiful Penang Island, the cultural stronghold of Singapore, and return to their ancestral homes in Guangzhou, Xiamen, and Fuzhou, to see their aging parents with graying hair and missing teeth? This yearning for family reunions is the common thread in the hearts of most Overseas Chinese. Finally, good news has arrived: the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) is sending ships to Rangoon to transport returning Overseas Chinese, and these ships will also carry Overseas Chinese back to their homeland.</p>
<p>On October 8th, the Consulate General in Rangoon announced to the newspapers that the "Fengqing" transport ship would arrive for the first time in September. This time, UNRRA is repatriating over 1,900 Overseas Chinese, including 180 from Meixian, 50 from Fujian, and over 1,670 from Guangdong. This news brought much excitement, but also endless sorrow to some women. One woman, knowing that her husband was returning with a "War of Resistance wife," was so stimulated that she couldn't sleep all night and poured out her inner pain in writing. She said: "The cruel and savage war demon not only destroyed peace on earth but also killed the pure love between husband and wife. Peace on earth has now been restored, but unfortunately, that pure love is dead and can never be revived! ... When a rumor becomes reality, or when a letter arrives, originally thought to be a notice of departure, but instead reports the fact of bigamy, how disappointed and painful is the side of the 'abandoned resentful wife'! ... Chinese women have not truly achieved equal status with men, so women suffer losses in nine out of ten cases. Divorce? How to survive! Remarriage? Men and women alike will condemn you for 'losing your virtue'! What a cruel shackle! Are the sisters across the country to let this heavy shackle bind them forever until the end of the earth? ... I will not weep bitterly, nor will I hide and sob. I will not commit suicide, nor will I shave my head and become a nun! Although I have no savings and still have two children to raise, I don't believe I can't be independent. I don't believe a woman will starve to death if she leaves her husband! ... When your husband leaves you, if you are a devout Buddhist, don't you often turn to the compassionate Guanyin, wholeheartedly taking refuge and bowing in worship, wishing your husband a speedy return and reunion? If you are a devout Christian, don't you often repent of your sins before the Lord, sincerely praying that your husband's love will remain unchanged? These are all superfluous things. I was a fool for a lifetime. Men are accustomed to oppressing women, thinking that 'what's done is done,' and the wife will eventually forgive. We cannot allow this kind of tyranny by men to continue. We must seek economic independence and establish equal status between the sexes."</p>
<p>On October 9th, the newspaper reported that the Fengqing ship would arrive in Rangoon at 2:00 PM. Before noon, both sides of Rangoon's Pier No. 5 were already filled with men, women, old, and young, gazing at the horizon for the ship's silhouette. Time passed second by second, and the hearts of those standing on the shore were filled with boundless anticipation. Finally, at 2:00 PM, the magnificent Fengqing ship arrived. With a long blast of the whistle, the crowd on the shore surged, and the returning Overseas Chinese were eager to disembark immediately. At this moment, Consul General Yin, Deputy Consul Liu, along with the heads of the British government's customs, health, welfare, and police departments, boarded a small motorboat to go to the large ship first. The hot sun shone on the glittering river, reflecting the joyful waves in people's hearts. After some brief negotiations, the returning Overseas Chinese, holding passports and documents, fathers carrying their little sisters, mothers dragging their little brothers, entered the massive customs inspection station in a single file. Although the returning Overseas Chinese looked tired due to the hardships of sea travel, they suddenly discovered relatives and friends while looking around, and immediately waved their hands wildly, greeting each other and exchanging wishes of safety. This was a reunion after a great disaster, how fortunate! At this time, the Consul General addressed the returning Overseas Chinese, warmly welcoming them to Rangoon and wishing them a peaceful life. As a result, the detailed registration of over a thousand people, including their names, addresses, past occupations, relationships, and future plans, could not be completed at once. To streamline the procedures, the returning Overseas Chinese were sent back to the cabins for the night. The next day was National Day, and they successfully returned to their homes or the meeting halls of their hometown associations, seeing the national flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth flying everywhere.</p>

Chairman Chiang, with a smiling face, said: "Today's National Assembly's constitution-making is the beginning of democratic constitutionalism." Assembly Chairman Wu Zhihui said: "Today is an unprecedented grand gathering since the founding of the Republic." The assembly adjourned in harmonious and bright music, and as the delegates walked out of the venue, they still carried a surge of joyful and enthusiastic emotions. All of this has been vividly illustrated in the following pictures!</p>

<h3>Autumn Prose</h3>
<p>— He Feng</p>
<p>Autumn may be the season of poetry, but it is indeed the season of prose.</p>
<p>You look up to the sky. The autumn sky is cloudless, with a pale blue canopy, but with a radiant sun in the center. The light shines on your body, not too hot, but warm and pleasant. The breeze blows, carrying the fragrance of wild mountain flowers. Don't you remember the boundless wilderness outside the city? Wouldn't you want to go there on a sunny holiday to breathe in some fresh air? Lying on the grass, softer than a sofa, looking at the mountains, flowing water, white clouds, and the golden, shimmering rice ears reflecting the intense sunlight, it seems they are shy! All lowered their heads together, not daring to look up. A gust of wind rushes over, and a surge of waves rises in the field, shimmering with gold, undulating all the way to the distant horizon. The unnamed wildflowers by your feet emit a faint fragrance, and in the distant sky, three or five birds soar. A long gaze also makes you appreciate the beauty of nature. The silence makes you quiet, and unknowingly reminds you of the past, thus consuming the entire afternoon. This is the greatest landscape painting, the most beautiful scenery. A few hours of appreciation will surely cleanse you of the vulgarity of the city and the fatigue of your body and mind. This is the autumn prose, the autumn field prose.</p>
<p>Perhaps you prefer mountains and forests to the wilderness. I know you are like the fiery maple forests in the autumn mountains. So you will venture far up the mountain, undeterred by difficulties. How strange! From a distance, it looks like a wildfire set by a wild child. The fire is really strong, the flames spreading everywhere, but the fire doesn't seem to spread. As you get closer, the fire is even stronger and redder, but everything is still fine. The small leaves, shaped like palms, are scattered by the wind, and even the ground is covered with a layer of fire. This is the maple forest—the autumn maple forest. Of course, everything around is quiet. You will also sit down quietly and think, then open your sketchbook and write down the white clouds in the sky and this magnificent fiery scene, or open your book and recite a refreshing poem, a beautiful piece of prose. If there are still streams on the mountain, taking advantage of the fact that the stream water has not yet dried up, you will definitely find it in the warm autumn. There, you will wash your feet, like a child, playing in the water, building a dam, or digging a small canal in the hard mountain soil. Echoing the surging sound of the water, you will sing a soaring and majestic song, looking around at the mountains, and feeling like a hero. This is the prose of the mountains.</p>
<p>Speaking of flowers! Autumn flowers are no less beautiful than spring flowers! Counting on your fingers, deep red peonies, pale red goosefoot, yellow mimosa... What must be mentioned in particular is the autumn chrysanthemum. Who among flower lovers would not love chrysanthemums? So proud, like a reclusive hermit; so pure and beautiful, like a lightly made-up beauty; so magical, one simply cannot count her types and colors; facing her, even vulgar people will receive elegant inspiration. Even the wild chrysanthemums in the mountains are lovely, like a group of stars in the sky, adorning a thin stem, with few green leaves to embellish it, swaying in the wind, fragrant. Then there are osmanthus flowers! That is also enough to make people linger. Quietly spreading such a noble fragrance, creating an atmosphere of prose, aren't the petite and elegant flowers also masterpieces among flowers? Although the flowers bloom and fade easily, a regrettable thing, that fragrance is enough to add color to autumn. As for the laurel wreath on the poet's head, the anecdotes that have been passed down, aren't they also a beautiful story among flowers? This is the prose of flowers.</p>
<p>The autumn night is so high, so refreshing, adorned with stars; the autumn moon is so bright, so clear, the Mid-Autumn Festival moon is especially round, and the sky is especially high; except for young, ignorant children, who would lightly abandon such a beautiful night scene, such a rare festival, and not wait until they have seen the moonlight before their eyelids are willing to be controlled by their nerves, reluctantly returning to their rooms to sleep. The autumn stars are also especially small, especially bright, so bright that they are lovable. As for the autumn white clouds, they cannot be compared to those of other seasons, stretching and curling in the sky, against the azure dome, changing every second. So fickle, truly indescribable by humans. Just blink, and it has changed! Before it was a white polar bear, now it is a snow-covered larch, wearing a white coat; perhaps in another blink, it will become a gallant white horse? All this is so mysterious. This is the prose of night and clouds.</p>
<p>Autumn rarely has rain, but once the northeast wind sweeps in, the climate suddenly turns cold, and fine autumn rain will flutter down. The rain is so fine, it's really like threads, long, seemingly broken but never really breaking, drifting diagonally. As soon as you go out, you will get wet. Once it rains, it will last for ten days or half a month, it seems there will never be a sunny day. This is the annoying autumn rain. If you are living in a foreign land, without relatives, won't your homesickness be awakened by it? If you are sick in another place, listening to this monotonous sound of wind and rain in the middle of the night, the candlelight flickering, as if ghosts are about to appear, won't you spontaneously feel desolate and lonely? Even during the day, looking at that gray, cloudy sky, who wouldn't be worried? All the frustrations and disappointments of a lifetime will come to mind all at once. There is no laughter in the autumn rain, but it brings a touch of sadness, like slightly astringent olives, but with endless memories. This is the prose of autumn rain.</p>
<p>Even the insects have to be pushed to autumn. On autumn nights, in the corners of walls and courtyards, groups of symphony orchestras begin to play. All the unknown musicians are each playing a peculiar melody - mostly sad, like the border region's Hujia - responding and harmonizing, never stopping due to fatigue, not willing to stop until dawn. This is the autumn sound, the prose of music.</p>
<p>Autumn symbolizes silence, solitude, everything is calm, coldly like an ancient Guangling San, with no trace of frenetic rhythm; just a faint, lonely thin net, allowing you to contemplate and appreciate it; just a painting, not a Hollywood Technicolor movie. Everything is quiet and stable, without frenzy, without magic, therefore there are no novels, few poems, but endless prose—autumn prose.</p>
<h3>Poetry and Reality</h3>
<p>— Luo Binjia</p>
<p>The world is vast and rich, and life is even more extraordinarily changeable and complex, so there will never be a shortage of inspiration for doing things; however, poetry must be "impromptu poetry," that is to say, reality provides an endless stream of causes and materials for poetry. (Quoted from "Goethe's Conversations")</p>
<h3>Chrysanthemum Art</h3>
<p>— Chun Tai</p>
<p>A Brief Discussion on Planting</p>
<p>The period for appreciating chrysanthemums is at most half a month, but the time for cultivating them has not been interrupted for a year. After understanding the difficulty of planting chrysanthemums, those who visit chrysanthemum exhibitions will surely have a richer interest in appreciating chrysanthemums.</p>
<p>The chrysanthemums loved by Tao Yuanming are far less magnificent and varied than what we see now. What is still called "Tao's Beloved Chrysanthemum" is an ancient species, a small flower with yellow, thin petals. This kind of wild chrysanthemum has gradually increased and changed through artificial cultivation.</p>
<p>In the late spring and early summer, break off chrysanthemum branches two or three inches long, insert them into the soil, and they will take root and grow in a week, blooming in autumn, larger than those that bloom from older branches. This is called cutting.</p>
<p>Grafting chrysanthemum branches onto another chrysanthemum plant or artemisia plant makes the flowers even larger. This is called grafting. Grafting can make a single plant bloom with thousands of flowers, or red, white, and yellow flowers all bloom on the same plant, becoming a strange bonsai.</p>
<p>However, the shape and color of the flowers that bloom from cuttings and grafts are exactly the same as the original flowers, except for being larger.</p>
<p>The novel chrysanthemum species seen recently are not natural but artificially produced, that is, two kinds of chrysanthemums are taken and cross-pollinated when they bloom, and then the ripe seeds are taken and sown to germinate. This is called seed breeding. The flowers that bloom from seed breeding are a mixture or compromise of the father and mother species, producing new patterns. The "Apricot Red Flag" planted by Mr. Yue Yuan, the owner of Huangyuan Garden (illustrated in (1)), is a beautiful example of a new species.</p>
<p>When cross-pollinating, it must be isolated from other flowers, placed in a flower room or by a glass window before flowering, and do not open the window to prevent wild flower pollen in the air from sneaking in (detailed in my book "Beijing Huh").</p>
<p>If the flowers of the father and mother species bloom at uneven heights, bricks must be used to raise them to the same height so that the two flowers face each other closely. After the flowers are dry, take the flat, thin seeds from the centers of the two flowers and sow them in the spring, and they will germinate and be divided into separate plants. Unfortunately, most of these new species are not successful, only about two or three out of a hundred pots, and a year of cultivation must be thorough and flawless. After the chrysanthemums wither, the seeds can all be collected, but the results are chaotic and more difficult to succeed than artificial cross-pollination.</p>
<p>In this exhibition, Mr. Liu Jinchao's Green Lotus (2) and Mr. Jin Xirong's Trusting Osmanthus (3) are both valuable; the Silver Needle (4) of the Municipal Public Works Bureau and the Yellow Plum (5) of the Xinhua Farm are also rare. However, exhibitors with single-stem styles are more likely to win.</p>
<h3>Chrysanthemum</h3>
<p>— Sun Fuxi</p>
<h3>Yellow Flowers</h3>
<p>— Shi Bei</p>
<p>Outside my window, weeds grow densely. A layer of white frost covered them in the morning, and the green color of the grass leaves has all disappeared, leaving only withered and yellow heads hanging low. These green lives are coming to an end; only the grass mound is, healthily standing a few yellow flowers, enduring frost and dew, breaking through the atmosphere of this lonely season. Even if it is a small yellow flower, what a stubborn life it is!</p>
<p>The sun slowly breaks through a thin layer of fog and shines down. The flowers bathed in the sunlight, revealing some golden colors; the frost marks on the flower leaves that have gradually digested also permeated with some warm airflow.</p>
<p>The yellow flowers of late autumn are not like the roses that bloom in early spring, those bright reds and purples, like a smile that stores melancholy, disappearing in an instant. Nor are they like the bright red pomegranates of summer, so intense and dazzling; the winter plums blooming on the snowy branches seem too cold and clear. Only these yellow flowers of autumn, like a kind old friend, remotely extend a warm and sincere hand to you. Seeing it, needless to say, we will be like a wanderer who has traveled through desolate grass paths and returned, willing to stop and linger by its side. It will not use light smiles and shallow frowns to seduce you, nor will it use skilled and provocative emotions to stir your heart. It calls you to think of the past, to be true to yourself, and to restrain the wildness of youth! Standing quietly opposite the yellow flowers, you will have more old feelings, you seem to be happy, yet you also seem to be sad.</p>
<p>Yellow flowers are also a symbol of loyalty. Have you ever had the experience of living in an ancient mountain city? Years of wind and sand have eroded the essence of the mountain city, the dilapidated city walls are full of decline and desolation, and even the stories of the martyrs who defended the city in the past have been pushed away by true legends. But seeing the annual yellow flowers on the city wall can lead your thoughts and create a close connection with this ancient city. You think: under the yellow flowers and yellow earth, how many white bones of martyrs have been buried, how many blood and tears of the people have been shed; the vicissitudes of history have been several disasters. The historical facts of these ancient fortresses are just like a city of dusk, and you want to open up a brand new world for it.</p>
<p>Or you let those wild yellow flowers grow together by a sparse fence. They are strong and bright. In the dim light of the setting sun, you and your shadow walk back and forth for a while. At this time, although you see fallen leaves drifting in the courtyard, or you encounter autumn wind and oblique rain, you still feel that the autumn scenery is lovely.</p>
<p>I sit in the room, looking at the sky outside the window, aren't these hardy flowers of late autumn "not ashamed of the pale autumn appearance of the old garden, but look at the fragrance of the hardy flowers of late autumn"? After all, autumn brings me some good news.</p>
<h3>Jialing River Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Zang Zan</p>
<p>Purple Swallow</p>
<p>I heard that there is a kind of bird in the world called the Purple Swallow. It grows by the sea and specializes in fighting the waves. When they smell a big storm coming, they will fly up to meet it.</p>
<p>And migratory birds that follow the sun like sunflowers are also beautiful: during each migration, I don't know how many small birds or old birds fall into the sea. Even if they are fortunate enough to encounter a ship in the ocean, which can provide them with a place to rest or forage for food, it is said that few have the ability to fly again, so they become food for others, or still fall into the sea. Even if they fly up again, there is an endless desert after crossing the ocean... That journey is long and arduous.</p>
<p>Although the journey is so difficult, I have never heard of a swallow on anyone's beam being exempted from the pilgrimage-like trek in any year.</p>
<p>Oath</p>
<p>Who loves life more than a sick person? Because he lives on the edge of death.</p>
<p>Blue sky, white clouds, flowers, wind, sunshine, pedestrians outside the window... all make people nostalgic! Like never having touched or understood them before.</p>
<p>Now I know that all this is life!</p>
<p>All the past days have been wasted.</p>
<p>If I could get life again, how fully would I live in those days! I will never let a small amount of time or things slip by me.</p>
<h3>Appreciating Chrysanthemums</h3>
<p>— Xu Shiqi</p>
<p>With the moistening grace of the three springs, the cool and clear autumn season,</p>
<p>Dew condenses without drifting dust, the sky is high and the scenery is clear. (Tao Qian's time)</p>
<p>For nine years, I have been locked in the high mountains and steep ridges, the rugged Shu Road, the swaying Zhan trees, and the quiet bamboo dwellings on the banks of the Jialing River. After a long time, the car returned to Jiangnan. It was the golden season of high autumn and refreshing air, when all the flowers bloom (European proverb). Poets and painters, facing this rich and varied color, and the splendid and gentle sunlight, have unlimited interest; the greatness of nature is that it can contribute this continuous creation to the comfort of the human soul!</p>
<p>I took some time out of my busy schedule to appreciate a chrysanthemum exhibition held by the city government in Fuxing Park. The five colors were gorgeous, and the flowers were gathered together. Among the fine varieties were "Ice Disk Holding Osmanthus," "Oriole Leaving the Valley," "Snow Ling Mountain," and "Golden Petal Lotus"; and the products of the Huangyuan Garden owner were the most skilled in winning the arena. I remember Lu You's verse about Bai Juyi: "The moon blossoms bloom late without peerless beauty, the wind is strong and often moves with strange fragrance, a little embellishment of this cool and clear season, washing away the disturbing worldly worries of the past few days."</p>
<h3>An Inch of Territory, An Inch of Blood 94</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Put down your weapons... Charge!" The fellow recited the order like a lesson, one word at a time, slowly, with a very stern voice. Most Japanese were short, but this one was nearly six feet tall, and judging by his voice, I knew he was strong. The fact that he was alone, calmly scouting this area, showed his cunning. The fact that he was doing the search work alone showed his courage and that he must have exceptional skills and abilities.</p>
<p>Hearing his words, Tiger Brother and I had no choice but to drop our guns. Facing us were a submachine gun and this wolf-like Japanese soldier. Behind us were large amounts of gasoline and a lit fuse. We were in the restricted area of a secret Japanese lair, the so-called heart of the military. Furthermore, they had activated full security. There might be other searchers and dogs following behind him. All it would take was for him to give an alarm, and all the searchlights would focus on this spot. The whole team of men and dogs would rush here. Escaping would be harder than climbing to heaven!</p>
<p>"Fight it out?" But if Tiger Brother pulled out his second gun, regardless of whether he could hit the enemy quickly, the enemy would definitely fire. And as soon as he fired, the gasoline on the ground would ignite. In that half-second or less, the movement of an arm, was the moment of our death or the enemy's. That being said, I didn't think it was the right time for a final showdown. We needed quick wit, or a godsend opportunity.</p>
<p>"Little Aunt, what about the fire on the ground?" Tiger Brother asked me, while raising his hands as instructed, but stepping aside, as if deliberately letting the enemy see the fire on the ground.</p>
<p>"Shut up, I'll beat you... Charge!" the Japanese soldier roared.</p>
<p>Maybe this guy didn't see us start the fire? Maybe he didn't realize the ground was covered in gasoline? While roaring, he took two steps closer to us, his eyes searching for the fire on the ground. At the same time, he opened his nostrils and sniffed the gasoline covering the ground, as if appreciating the aroma of wine. Here, I must borrow a familiar phrase from old novels: "No sooner said than done!" In that split second when the guy was distracted by the fire—perhaps only a tenth of a second—Tiger Brother shouted, "Little Aunt, step aside!" He immediately performed a somersault, using his arm as a fulcrum, diving and rolling, covering more than ten feet of ground, arriving in front of the guy. The guy, seeing Tiger Brother's sudden move, was probably startled. Just as he was about to aim his gun, Tiger Brother, taking advantage of his rolling momentum, suddenly straightened his legs and jumped up, kicking the guy's left elbow. The submachine gun was jolted away, slipping from his left hand. In that instant, Tiger Brother swept his left hand outwards, sending the gun flying away.</p>
<p>"Hmm!" The famous Japanese nasal sound came out urgently. He probably forgot his Chinese in his urgency, and roared and howled, presumably cursing. As his "Hmm" hadn't even completely left his nostrils, Tiger Brother, agile as he was, had already jumped up (because the guy was a head taller than Tiger Brother), raised his left hand in a feint, lowered his body, and thrust his right hand upwards faster than lightning, stabbing into the guy's soft ribs, twisting and shaking. According to Tiger Brother's practiced grabbing techniques and yin-yang strikes, this guy, no matter how tall and strong, had already had some of his internal organs destroyed.</p>

<h3>Reply to Mr. Gold</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>It is not wrong for Americans to stand on the side of Americans; it is also not wrong for Chinese to stand on the side of Chinese. What is wrong is harming China from an American standpoint, or harming America from a Chinese standpoint. By harm, I mean harm to proper international relations and cooperation. You have worked in China for a long time, you know us well, which shows you have feelings for us; you are a journalist, and from the standpoint of colleagues, we are more easily understood. Therefore, we thank you for this letter expressing your opinion.</p>
<p>In the past year, the public and private relations between China and the United States have undeniably been less close than during the period of fighting side by side. There are naturally many reasons for this, but we always believe that many narrow-minded ideas, with selfish interests as a prerequisite, coupled with the rumors and exaggerations fueled by other schemers, have made this situation particularly serious and tense. This is something that you, Mr. Gold, who wish for the better, to eliminate many misunderstandings and promote genuine friendship between China and the United States, and I, who share the same wish and willingness to make the same efforts, feel very uneasy and very sorry about.</p>
<p>In this situation, we will feel the great responsibility of us journalists. We have an ancient Chinese saying: "Befriend the upright, befriend the forgiving, befriend the well-informed." Being upright, forgiving, and well-informed in our words and reports is actually a very good guideline. Secondly, regarding free expression and open discussion, I believe that if it goes beyond the scope of goodwill, the result will probably be difficult to "help improve everyone's feelings." Moreover, if what is expressed and discussed is entirely focused on unpleasant aspects, it would be unfair. I wonder if you agree with this?</p>
<p>As for the "current real problem" that you feel, I think Mr. Willkie's book "One World" can help you get an answer. Region, nationality, and race should not prevent humanity from working together to achieve humanity's ideals. And we, from the Great Harmony chapter of the Book of Rites to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, have a consistent philosophical system that adheres to this ideal.</p>

<h3>Sexual Adjustment</h3>
<p>— Xu Rong</p>
<p>(Note: If one does not have a childish sense of mystery about sexual issues, and does not have a sense of "sex is a crime," then this article, which discusses practical sexual issues, should be a very serious piece of writing, and readers will surely be able to read it with an open and normal mind!)</p>
<p>Paul Popenoe, director of the American Institute of Family Relations, is an authority on contemporary male-female issues. He recently published a quite insightful discussion on "Sexual Adjustment," which is enough to serve as a compass for young people who are confused about the mystery of sex. He opposes the fallacy of "Trial Marriage," believing that sexual adjustment is not purely a physiological issue, but can be achieved with satisfactory results through mutual understanding and cooperation between the sexes.</p>
<p>A young female stenographer recently wrote a letter to Mr. Popenoe, saying that she had been very close to a young man for the past year and planned to marry him. However, he proposed to her with conditions. He said: The most important thing in marriage is satisfactory sexual adjustment. Therefore, he insisted on trying to find out before marriage whether they were sexually compatible. If they were, they would marry; otherwise, they should stop before it was too late to avoid tragedy. According to him, this was the most scientific approach. The female protagonist hoped that Mr. Popenoe would give her an answer. Below is Mr. Popenoe's opinion:</p>
<p>Most people generally hold erroneous views on sexual adjustment in marriage. They believe that sexual adjustment is predetermined. If it is compatible, then married life will naturally be satisfactory; otherwise, there is only the path of divorce. Their mistake lies in thinking that sexual adjustment is entirely determined by physiological conditions, which is not the case at all. Sexual incompatibility is really caused by psychological factors, while physiological defects are not particularly important.</p>
<p>The theory of so-called trial marriage completely ignores that in the beginning of any marriage, sexual adjustment is usually not satisfactory, due to nervous tension.</p>
<p>Mr. Popenoe once studied a thousand educated married women, and as many as two hundred and fifty of them said that they felt disgusted with their first sexual experience. The research results found that only 51 percent expressed satisfaction with their first experience, 40 percent expressed "tolerable," and the rest expressed pain.</p>
<p>It takes a considerable amount of time for wives to obtain complete satisfaction. Six hundred and fifty-eight women have reported on this experience. Twenty-five percent obtained satisfaction the first time, twenty-seven percent obtained satisfaction after several days or weeks, twenty-six percent obtained satisfaction after one month or eleven months, sixteen percent obtained satisfaction after one year or longer, and six percent never obtained satisfaction.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, sexual adjustment will naturally improve slowly under favorable psychological and social conditions. These conditions include feelings of mutual trust, a sense of permanent security, and freedom from terror.</p>
<p>Obviously, sexual adjustment can be strived for and is not predetermined. Therefore, trial marriage is not suitable for reality and is bound to encounter many difficulties. For example, young people often read some books about sex, most of which are vulgar books that describe a fantasy of satisfactory sexual life. When they find that the trial does not meet their ideals, they think that both parties are incompatible.</p>
<p>Excessive worry and excessive tension are the greatest enemies of sexual adjustment. Before holding a trial marriage, both men and women will inevitably feel worried and excessively tense, so the result will never be satisfactory. Moreover, there are many other difficulties: unfavorable environment, haste, keeping secrets, fear of being discovered, fear of pregnancy, the woman's fear that the man will abandon her later, fear that the other party will play with her and not prepare to marry her, and the man can easily judge that both parties are not sexually compatible.</p>
<p>The result is: cultivating a serious sense of inferiority. The man overemphasizes the results of the trial, thinking that he cannot adapt to normal standards. However, in reality, there is nothing abnormal about him. Both parties easily find fault with each other and are emotional. Even if they get married in the future, there will be no happy results.</p>
<p>So, how can one obtain satisfactory sexual adjustment in marriage? They must have normal emotions and attitudes. They must have sufficient sexual knowledge and mutual understanding. For this reason, they must receive realistic and scientific sex education, and should not read the fantasy stories written by sickly novelists. They must have permanent psychological preparation, and they must realize that married life is aimed at "growing old together in harmony." With such a healthy attitude and psychology, they don't have to worry about sexual adjustment problems.</p>

<h3>National ID Card Difficult to Obtain</h3>
<p>— Chi Mo</p>
<p>It's a joke, really. The households in my building all registered at the same time, but some of the National ID card application forms that were sent out were complete, and some were not. Is it possible that the current Baojia system is not as sound as it was during the enemy and puppet regime?</p>
<p>Our first Jia's Jia head is not like other Jia heads. He is a "bourgeois." He doesn't want to be "ostentatious," so there is no sign for the Jia head's office at his door. Anyway, people always have to go to his office to beg him. The Jia head's residence is a modern Western-style house with sturdy bronze doors that are always closed.</p>
<p>There is an electric bell on the wall of this elaborate door. We boldly pressed it. After a while, a small window suddenly opened in the door. A drunken-looking policeman appeared, his face flushed and his eyes bloodshot. He spoke in a "stone hard" Shanghai dialect, "Why are you ringing the bell?" After we told him our purpose, he put on a stern face and said, "You're so inconsiderate, it's lunchtime, don't bother me. Come back later." Bang! The small door slammed shut. It was already 2:30 pm, and the police officer was still having lunch with his wife. It was our fault for going too early, damn it.</p>
<p>We went again at 4 o'clock. This police officer looked us up and down, still not comfortable opening the big door. He interrogated us in great detail. He saw the "badge" on my lapel. He ordered me to take it off. He took it and admired it for a full ten minutes, like an archaeologist studying antiques, before opening the door and letting us in.</p>
<p>The Jia head said that the application forms were not enough because the above-level department didn't send enough, so they were being distributed according to party affiliation. Those who didn't get them would be supplemented later. There was nothing he could do about it. The Jia head took the forms, stretched out his hands, shook his head, and exhaled heavily through his nostrils, as if sighing slightly.</p>
<h3>Plagiarism Trend</h3>
<p>— Sheng Jie</p>
<p>No one, ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign, is born knowing how to write an article. It is not surprising that later generations quote the articles of previous generations and refer to the skills of previous generations, but that does not mean that copying other people's articles is a matter of course. Copying other people's articles without thinking and submitting them is tantamount to fraudulently obtaining property.</p>
<p>However, recently many contributors cannot change their bad habits. On the 13th, a certain newspaper in the local area published two articles: "Sun Liren Who Established Miraculous Achievements" and "Wang Yaowu Who Sits in Jinan." After reading them, the author felt very strange, because I had also written these two articles. The "Sun Liren" article was published by the author in Shenbao's Free Talk on September 30, 1946. When the newspaper published it, it omitted a section from "then entered West Point Military Academy to study" to "dare not be casual," and the rest of the original text was exactly the same as what the author wrote. As for the "Wang Yaowu" article, it was published by the author in Free Talk this year on Double Ten Day. The full text published by the newspaper was exactly the same as what the author wrote. I think this method of copying is too stupid!</p>
<p>I don't admit that my articles are well written, but I don't want them to be stolen, and I hate the trend of stealing articles. Therefore, I reveal the above, hoping that the editors of various newspapers will be careful of literary swindlers!</p>

<h3>The Innocent Murderer 4</h3>
<p>— Xu Guiting</p>
<p>"To be honest, I knew myself that the injury to my leg was not very serious. But because I was afraid they would discover that I could still jump around, I pretended to be completely crippled, lying on the ground without moving. Later, the opportunity came. One night, I exhausted all my strength to loosen the wooden stake, and then pulled it out to use it as a supporting stick. At that time, I saw a Japanese soldier outside the door taking off his helmet and resting. In an instant, I jumped two or three steps and landed behind the guy, using all my strength to smash the wooden stake on his head. At that time, because I used too much force, the wooden stake rebounded like a spring and flew out of my hand. And that Japanese soldier went to heaven like that. I laughed heartily, and then fumbled around until I found a group of Burmese people. Coincidentally, they were either pro-British or anti-Japanese, so with their help, I survived like this."</p>
<p>After finishing his story, Lu Xun looked at his watch and said, "It's almost five o'clock. Did I talk too much? Are you getting impatient?"</p>
<p>"Good heavens! Not at all," Mien replied. "However, I think you've told me enough this time. Let's end this conversation."</p>
<p>The next time, Lu Xun not only arrived on time but also earlier than usual at Mien's clinic. Mien, who was suffering from a headache, smiled at Lu Xun and said, "Do you feel better?"</p>
<p>"Better? I feel completely different than before. Your injections really work like magic."</p>
<p>"Of course," Mien said. "You used to have many things bottled up in your chest. Now that some of them have been cleared away, you naturally feel much more relaxed. So, let's continue talking."</p>
<p>Hearing this, the smile on Lu Xun's face completely disappeared. He asked blankly, "Continue?"</p>
<p>"Yes, we still have to clear away the rest of the things that are bottled up in your heart before we can stop. Now let's begin."</p>
<p>"But, begin what?" Lu Xun smiled, feeling quite confused. "I feel like I've completely recovered."</p>
<p>"I dare not make a judgment yet," Mien said calmly. "You seem much better. But I don't dare say to what extent. Let me investigate further."</p>
<p>Lu Xun immediately blushed and said awkwardly, "I thought psychoanalysts also needed to eat."</p>
<p>Mien frowned slightly, without answering anything.</p>
<p>Lu Xun suddenly became furious and said coldly, "Okay! I want to warn you, I don't have a single penny, and I can't continue to bother you like this. I feel very good, so there's no need to continue with those unnecessary tests."</p>
<p>Mien replied softly, "The purpose of your coming here today is to persuade me to believe that you have been cured. When I say that I still can't make a judgment, you immediately start arguing with me. You want me to lose my temper so that you can leave. To be honest, you clearly still have many unspeakable things in your heart. These things are the source of your troubles. They are still there, plaguing you, constantly clinging to you, not allowing you to get rid of them, right?" (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Weekend Chat</h3>
<p>— Liu Sui</p>
<p>Two Kinds of Food</p>
<p>According to news from Yinqu, Shanxi, "the abundance of drugs and the extreme shortage of textbooks in Taiyuan City are inversely proportional." It is said that during the occupation, the atmosphere of poison was everywhere. After the victory, many of those returning to their former posts resumed their bad habits. Recently, because smoking opium is tedious and time-consuming, most have switched to inhaling white powder. Because the supply and demand meet, those who traffic drugs continuously transport them from Pingjin and other places. But on the other hand, middle school textbooks and reference books in various counties and cities in Shanxi Province cannot be transported due to traffic congestion, and students are extremely depressed, so their attitude toward education is extremely low. Bringing these two things together is very worrying. White powder is produced in the Pingjin area, and books should also be supplied by Pingjin; white powder can pass through customs and be transported safely, so that the market does not lack it, while books cannot meet students because of "traffic congestion." Don't think that students are of low level, they may sometimes become smart. If, in their depression, they feel that eating and doing nothing all day is too unfair to their parents, and the transportation of white powder is not difficult, they will be happy to join the ranks of trafficking. It could be a business for them to make a lot of money. Then teachers will also be jealous and rush to catch up, and teachers and students will cooperate. What will become of us then?</p>
<p>Fortunately, It Didn't Come True</p>
<p>Recently, a very interesting news story happened in Sichuan: a female teacher's clock in a distant bedroom of the Qu County Girls' Middle School was stolen, and it could not be found anywhere. So she sought the help of a fortune teller. The fortune teller calculated and told her that it was in the school's pond. The female teacher then ordered all the workers in the school to go into the water to look for it, but still found nothing, and was very angry, guessing and suspecting. This made all the male and female workers in the school panic. So everyone gathered in an open space, burned candles, swore oaths, and declared their innocence, and the situation became very serious. Looking at the way it was, this female teacher was probably studying psychology. Not wanting to lose her beloved object, she of course sought the help of divination, and then sought the help of swearing oaths; but unfortunately, the result seemed to have no harvest from her clinical experiment in psychology, but only caused a "situation of peace to become serious." But we really broke out in a cold sweat for the education in Sichuan Province, because if the lost item had really been found in the pond after a divination, or if any clues had been found after an oath, then the female students would have silently kept it in mind. In the future, when they were raising children, they would draw inferences from one case. The astrology and candle industries in Qu County would all be eagerly waiting and shouting that their cause was not isolated!</p>
<p>For Money</p>
<p>Two news stories this week can be combined as a basis for tea talks: One is that there is a person named Chen Guangqi in Xinhai County, Hebei. During the Anti-Japanese War, he joined the army and fought in various places. His wife, Ms. Liu, did not know in what year she and his younger brother got together and lived together. When the hero returned in triumph this year, he was furious and staged a full-scale martial arts fight, resulting in deaths and injuries on both sides. The other is that there is a person named Tang Chaoji in Xinhui County, Hunan, whose family is wealthy. Although there are several brothers, they have repeatedly tried to dominate the family property. Recently, Tang asked his sister-in-law and brother's wife to divide the grain rent, and was immediately angered, using an ax to chop his sister-in-law, brother, nephew and niece, four people. Afterwards, knowing that he could not avoid punishment, he also castrated himself with a razor and died. In the former case, the discord among relatives was caused by the fact that Ms. Liu had no means of support after her husband left; in the latter case, the disaster arose from the fact that Tang wanted to get as much money as possible. In short, both were forced by life and prices. At present, such facts are probably happening at all times and in all places. Even if there are feelings, they are trivial and not worthy of high discussion, so I will temporarily create the title above, just as a cry!</p>
