<h3>馬帥司使先後返京　當晚同進餐並交換意見　尋求恢復和平商談辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報牯嶺廿日電〕馬帥廿日下午二時廿分離牯返京，皮參軍宗闞隨行，聞馬帥此次下山，將以在牯與主席商談結果，與司徒雷登大使在京交換意見，繼續爲和平努力，並聞馬帥可能於本週末再登廬山。</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺廿日電〕馬歇爾元帥廿日下午二時離牯赴　飛京，行前曾邀晤俞大維長談，俞氏除與馬帥晤談外，曾於晨八時及晚七時兩度晋謁主席，並於馬帥登程時，以長途電話報告在滬之宋院長。聞昨晚七時蔣主席曾訪馬帥，並同赴行轅共進晚餐，俞亦在座，叙談至十時。</p>
<p>〔本報北平二十日電〕司徒雷登大使，二十日晨九時偕其秘書傅涇波，陶履　搭馬帥專機飛京，美陸次斐特森等同行，饒伯森等送行，司使行前並曾與饒作長談。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕馬帥及司使，廿日分別由廬山，北平飛返京，當晚七時半，司徒驅車赴寗海路馬帥行館，共進晚餐，並商談如何促使國共談判恢復問題。馬帥乘機係下午六時十分降落大較塲機塲，馬帥下機後，即入所備汽車，記者在引擎發動短促之時間內，探身訪問馬帥，記者詢以返京後，和平商談是否重開，渠答稱：我想如此，詢其關於共產黨近日對渠之批評觀感如何，答謂，我對任何批評，都無意見，馬帥並含笑告記者，馬夫人在牯甚好，其本人最近仍有赴廬可能，旋與記者道別，乘順風牌車疾馳入城。又據與馬帥同來之國府參軍皮宗闞少將稱：特使此次在牯，居留八日，曾謁蔣主席兩次，第二次係於返京前夕，二人長談數小時，由俞大維部長任翻譯。</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺廿日電〕交長俞大維此次來牯，曾將恢復交通計劃及圖表帶呈主席核閱，並送請馬帥參考。關於共軍最近破壞隴海路徐鄭段情形，亦經繪有精細圖表，聞馬帥閱後，頗表憤慨。又交部恢復交通計劃，着重於現被分成三段之津浦路，能首先全綫通車。</p>
<h3>停戰與改組政府　司使主同時並進　注意共黨激動性廣播</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕司徒雷登大使，週前由京飛平，處理燕大校務，廿日午十一時半返抵京，其私人顧問傳涇波及燕大校長陸志韋同來，大使將在京久居，故由另一飛機送來大批用器及古玩，字畫，大使抵使館後，於下午四時半接見記者，傳涇波顧問在座，大使對中國內戰擴大，表示極端焦慮，渠稱：雙方如此打下去，不惟雙方，即全國人民均將同遭慘烈犧牲。並謂：渠視中國爲第二故鄉，實無限關懷，言至此，沉默不言者良久。大使對十九日共產黨張家口播音台激動性之廣播，甚爲注意，記者應邀詳告。大使復稱：當前中國問題，停戰與改組政府二事同等重要，應同時並進。渠述及外傳美國將改變對華政策及自中國完全退出（包括美軍）問題時稱：果美國輿論如此，華府可能改變對華政策，惟現在並非如此，美軍撤退將使中國陷入更混亂之局面。記者旋詢大使對蔣主席文告有何印象，渠稱：很同意。大使最後謂：決繼續爲中國和平努力，馬帥亦無回國準備。記者等半小時之談話中，深覺大使掬誠之情，令人感佩，且無悲觀情緒。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京二十日電〕據可靠方面今日透露之消息：馬歇爾於星期日自牯嶺致電周恩來，謂政府現正計劃擴大其立塲，詢其共產黨可否提供改組政府之候補人名單。聞周氏已於當日電復馬歇爾，予以拒絕。</p>
<p>〔本報南京二十日電〕馬帥司使返京後，當晚未邀周恩來商談，亦未與周通電話。廿日竟日中，周除於上午九時偕廖承志及共產黨代表團人員赴廖仲凱墓祭掃外，無活動，廿日係廖殉難廿一週年紀念日。</p>
<h3>政府續請軍調部調處　國軍仍堅守大同　同蒲綫南段侯馬站收復</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕大同戰況在拉鋸式之狀態下，猛烈進行，共軍已迫近城郊，然經數度猛撲後，沙岑雖爲共軍攻陷，但曹福樓則仍在國軍手中，故週餘以來，共軍對大同之攻勢，雖付以極大代價，然大同城仍固若金湯。同蒲綫已被截爲三段，汾河平原汶水交城等縣共軍，又展開攻勢，同蒲綫南段侯馬站，已爲國軍收復。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿日電〕軍調部大同小組，因共方代表離城未返，政府與美方小組返平後，政府方面認爲大同在共軍猛攻下，應繼續調處，故前日曾通知共方，說明共方應另派代表，出面調處，共方已允，但尚未派出。又政府方面因大同被攻，對共方提出國軍爲援助大同守軍，有採取行動自由之備忘錄後，共方表示將在共產黨對馬司聯合聲明之反響中，一併有所表示。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿日電〕軍調部三委員，爲全面調處熱河之衝突及未決問題，昨再會議，決定重申前令，命朝陽，承德，赤峯三小組，繼續與熱河國共兩軍最高指揮官聯絡，至於日期議程由小組聯合會議決定，地點則將仍在平泉。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿日電〕軍息，共軍又自冀中調往大同三個旅，附有山砲十餘門，分在大同東西南三方外圍助戰。　作義到平後，昨晚探問病中之馬占山，馬精傳將其現駐包頭之一部兵力，空運大同增援，並請與空軍當局聯絡，勿因機塲稍欠安全而懈怠接濟</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿日電〕某軍事負責當局語記者，大規模之戰事，已在大同周圍繼續一週，數逾五萬之共軍，由賀龍聶榮臻駢肩指揮，每夜猛烈向大同進攻六次，攻擊者之部隊，常在數千人甚至萬人以上，守軍數目遠遜於共軍，但士氣極旺，作戰成績甚佳，發言人稱由於大同之戰，可供給國人判斷國事之資料：（一）究竟誰在打誰，（二）誰的兵多，誰的兵少，（三）民心向誰背誰。</p>
<h3>程潛抵牯談話</h3>
<p>鄂境僅存小股共軍</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺廿日電〕武漢行轅主任程潛，廿日下午五時抵牯述職，據語記者，鄂境自李先念部共軍違反協定西竄，掀起戰事一月，現幸全部平定，境內僅西部之竹谿，興山，房縣間山地，與東部之黃梅，英山間，各有零星小股二千餘，尚待肅清，所有復區秩序，將告恢復，人民亦相率來歸，行轅刻正謀農村經濟文化之復興。</p>
<h3>首都明故宮　設新政治區　內政部奉令主持</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二十日電〕確息：內政部奉令主持首都明故宮新政治區設計事宜後，因現値各機關還都之際，不免有準備在該區內興建屋舍者，刻已呈請政院分令各機關，在該計劃完成前，暫勿在該區內興建工程。</p>
<h3>共軍破壞北寗路　津榆錦榆間客貨車出軌</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十九日電〕北寗路榆錦段前衛與前所站間，昨又遭共軍破壞，至此，水患甫退，即時恢復交通之列車，又受阻礙，日前錦榆間不通，錦瀋間因水患須繞道而行，平瀋通車又不知延至何時矣。</p>
<p>〔中央社天津廿日電〕共軍對北寗綫仍時予破壞，津榆段金溪河，茶淀兩站間二〇三公里處，鐵軌被拆十六節，廿日上午二時五十八分，五〇七次運煤車駛至該地出軌。榆錦段前所高嶺兩站間，機車一輛，客車四輛，亦因拆軌出事。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕熱河境內共軍，在赤峯至葉柏壽一綫集中兵力，其企圖在南下截斷北寗路，唯目前尚無大舉動。</p>
<h3>國軍主力抵達開封　豫東戰況轉平靜　蘇北共軍利用日俘作戰</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕隴海路戰況，近日略轉平靜，據悉十七日十八日共軍曾企圖進擾開封，以國軍主力趕到，乃未得逞，開封已安定無虞。朱仙鎮共軍，原有西北攻中牟截斷鄭汴間鐵路，及西截平漢路企圖，經國軍增援部隊猛擊，已不支向通許一帶　竄。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕魯南共軍一部份兵力，現集中蘇北淮陰宿遷一帶，約二萬餘人，有再攻徐州或南下之可能。山東境內淄川博山一綫，續有小衝突，觀其模樣，共軍在山東方面有發動較大規模之企圖。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕豫災呼籲團該省參議長張幼山，參議員呂　儒王敬修等，一行二十日由滬抵京，該團以豫省人禍天災，難民達八百六十餘萬，近復遭共軍肆虐，開封碭山間四百餘里農作，爲人民命脈所繫，均不能如期收穫，未來影響，不可想像，特定廿二日向政院及國防部請願，要求中央派兵戡亂，並舉辦緊急振濟。</p>
<p>〔中央社徐州廿日電〕軍息，共軍近由山東調來精銳部隊二萬餘，集結於高郵宿遷淮陰一帶地區，準備向徐州外圍，以及海安等處大舉進犯。據悉，該部共軍全係舊式裝備，并附有野山砲多門，輕重機槍多挺，其射手均係日人，顯係欲在蘇北軍作大規模之進犯。</p>
<p>〔中央社徐州廿日電〕軍息，共產軍利用日俘，襲擊國軍，已屢見不鮮，共軍第三師師長黃克誠，現率所部萬餘人，開抵東台，均係日式裝備，內有日俘二千餘人，并携有輕重迫擊砲廿餘門，其射手均由日俘操縱。</p>
<h3>大連共軍數萬　已在烟台登陸</h3>

<h3>美報論中共政策　對延長內爭中共應負重大責任</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十九日合衆電〕太陽報標題爲「中國之重大假定」之社論稱：蔣主席曾稱，唯有假定共產黨能遵守協定時，則中國始可免於內爭及建立真正之民主政府，該報檢討去冬以還境況之改變，而評論此成爲目前事實之中國之重大假定謂，曾有一時期，甚多美人認爲共產黨爲具有獨立人格者，即作爲中國人爲第一義，而作爲共產黨爲第一義，於增進中國永久福利之情況下，以具有莫斯科牌號之馬克斯主義，運用於其祖國，唯目前美人漸認共黨之政策非延安方面所擬定，而爲莫斯科方面所擬定者，此種政策，爲中國政府及世界許多國家所不能接受者。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約十九日電〕値茲中國內爭擴大之際，紐約午後出版之太陽報評稱：多數美國人現已相信：「延長內爭之責任，共黨所負者更爲重大。」該報稱：根據最近來自　國之消息，多數美人現已懷疑共黨是否願遵守其與國民政府所成立之協議，多數美人現已感覺　目前使中國延長內爭之責任，共黨所負者更爲重大。」</p>
<h3>駕機迫降於延安　四空軍逃返首都　據稱劉善本以淚洗面</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕據前與劉善本駕駛（B24）重轟炸機一同飛降延安，新近逃回之四空軍人員稱：劉抵延安後，每日深居斗室，以淚洗面，據稱：彼等初抵延安時，尚以爲到達西安　　爲共軍扣留，始知已抵共軍老巢，毛澤東，朱德等最初對彼等招待殷勤，並邀彼等廣播，宣傳「係爲和平反戰而來　　並假用名義，召開空軍節擴大紀念會，其後見彼等態度強硬，遂趨冷淡，待遇亦漸差，彼等曾兩次面質朱德，謂共軍既倡言民主，何以拘留彼等，並脅迫加入共軍？朱無辭以對，四人旋即獲釋，其餘人員政府亦正向共方交涉釋放中。</p>
<h3>榮譽二師一團　奉令調駐蘇州</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州廿日電〕駐蘇一四五旅奉令他　，另有新任務。本邑城防工作，經國防部令調六十七師第一團担任，十九日已由副團長茅禮讓中校統率，移駐完畢。按該團原係派駐日本佔領軍榮譽第二師戴堅將軍部，甫經改編，暫駐呉淞口待輪東渡，國防部陸軍總司令部，因江南治安正待特別強化，故命先行移　蘇垣，團長林冠雄少將，現在京請示機宜。</p>
<h3>共軍圖全面進攻　東北復呈由雨欲來之勢　政府仍盼履行政協決議</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕共軍圖發動全面攻勢，分區進擾。據悉：在蘇北·豫東·魯南·皖北區內，共方採避實趨虛策略，企圖在該區內使國軍五十萬人膠着。豫東方面，近因國軍防剿甚力，又擬改向其他方面襲擊。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿日電〕　安未久之東北，復有由雨欲來風滿樓之勢。此間關係　爭當局，日來連接共軍調動頻繁將有大規模行動之報告。今日此間晚報載瀋陽電稱：杜聿明赴各地指揮演習歸來後，經瀋北上之軍車甚多，李立三之突然到瀋，怱怱歸去，政府當局認係觀察動靜，興城綏中一帶已有戰事，海龍東方亦有接觸，城內可聞砲聲。</p>
<p>〔路透社天津二十日電〕中宣部國際宣傳處華北辦事處稱：共軍在東北松花江一帶及長春哈爾濱鐵道沿綫積極備戰，陶賴昭近有大批共軍增援部隊開到，內有重砲隊等，哈長綫沿綫共軍已築就堅強防綫。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿日電〕中共發出全面紛亂之信號後，各方咸表痛心，中央社記者特往訪國防部白部長，叩詢對此事看法。白氏答稱：余對此事毫不驚奇，因過去談判中關於政治協商，軍事協商，以及交通協商，共產黨迄未履行一件，最近政府仍盼其履行，而中共反變本加厲，在蘇北·大同·太原·徐州·曁隴海綫到處發動攻勢。記者關心開封之安危，白部長答曰：昨日聯合社駐京特派員米爾克斯君亦曾提出同樣問題，余告以開封穩定；又爲解答京滬綫安全，余絕對可以負責。白氏末稱：吾人本中央一貫政策，希望和平，希望政治解決，最近共產黨到處發動攻勢，但吾人認爲僅憑武力不能解決問題，且一國問題或世界問題，斷非武力所能解決，共產黨迷信武力，而吾人固仍願與之協商和平也</p>
<p>〔本報江都廿日電〕共產黨公然下令發動戰爭，蘇北人民聞悉之餘，無不表示最大之憤慨，惟未顯露驚訝，蓋共軍破壞協定，發動戰爭，事實早已存在，此僅爲其行動之具體化而已，記者特走訪揚州駐軍國軍整編廿五師黃百韜師長，詢問感想，據謂：共黨此種行動，乃自絕於國人，人民於八年戰爭之後，竭望和平安定，休養生息，政府亦一再容忍，期以政治方式解決問題，而共黨執迷不悟，今公開欲以武力奪取政權，圖一試野心家之陰謀，實乃中國人民之不幸，中國之復興建設，恐將因再此落後五十年。黃氏繼述蘇北局面因此乃趨明朗化，共軍勢將聚集兵力於此一臨近京畿地區，然國軍實力雄厚，戒備森嚴，彼如來犯，必將遭受慘重打擊云。</p>

<h3>在廬山，看政局。</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　謝寶珠</p>
<p>全國人士注視牯嶺，是由蔣主席蒞牯那天（七月十四日）開始的。當時，所給予人們的，　一股興奮的波動，尤其是馬帥·司徒雷登大使的陸續登山，使大家的目前更明銳地注視過來，敏感的記者們當然更形緊張了。</p>
<p>可是，從七月十四日到目前這一段日子，局勢的演變與冠蓋來往配合起來，其緊張的程度，實非記者們登山時所料及的。而牯嶺因此也由全國人士談話的中心而一躍爲全世界人士所注視的地方了。</p>
<p>緊張的序幕</p>
<p>緊張的序幕，是展開於安平事件的發生。此事發生在七月二十九日，然而在廬山的雲霧中散布這消息已是八月一日了。於是，上至權威方面，下至開談國事的人，都認爲此案已達嚴重階段，如不能保證類似事件不再發生，以及澈查此案之事實真象，終而予以合理之處理，則美國人士素昔對華之熱忱，將遭受不可低估之影響。同時，馬歇爾特使奔走努力的和平談判，勢將受到影響。在那幾天內，不但是司徒大使和蔣主席爲這事討論過好幾次，連美第七艦隊司令柯克上將也上山了，一面固然是消夏，一面也似乎特地爲了這事而來的。當此事發生之初，美國人還不能斷定究係何方所爲，經過幾位美要員在山上陸續得到報告後，已證明係共軍所爲無疑。這個時候，每個人的心理，都覺得有點惶惶不安，再加上美國輿論方面的反應，深恐事態越擴越大。不約而同的，大家把視綫釘住在馬帥和大使身上，看他們有何反應。雖然，美大使對此事採取冷靜客觀態度，但這到底不是件小案子，所以，在馬帥三次登山的時候，觀察家和記者們同樣地一口咬定馬帥此來完全是爲了「安平事件」的。</p>
<p>當馬二次下山的時候，大家認爲是爲了與中共代表周恩來賡續交換意見的，同時，一般過度敏感的人士還猜想三人會議可能移牯重開，那知事實大非人們所料，馬帥的怱怱下山原來爲的就是爲了「安平事件」。</p>
<p>實際上，也真難怪人們神經過敏。關於這些大局的談話，絕對不是向外人所能得到一點暗示的。然而，爲了事態的嚴重，搶先的報道，又不得不來一番「推測」，而這次的結果，又告失敗，馬帥三次上山郤並非專爲「安平事件」而來，主要的乃是關於「整個和平問題」。</p>
<p>「安平事件」在和平商談所蒙上的一層陰霾，已因蔣主席，馬帥及司徒大使之英斷與遠見而消除之後，牯嶺的空氣，也好像一片茫茫雲霧，一閃間散化而去，出現的是滿目青蒼，那幾天　　在同聲嘆息焦慮的是蘇北災民的慘情，咬牙切齒的是蘇北共軍決堤的暴行。</p>
<p>馬司的聲明</p>
<p>接着的是馬帥和司徒大使的聲明傳來，一時似乎有點使人覺得凶多吉少，正像他們在發表聲明前在南京對記者表示：「中國目前局勢甚爲黯淡」一般，多數人認爲「這一下是　有希望了。」</p>
<p>可是，兩位和平使者却不願因此而灰心，大使於十二日在京對中央社記者說，「吾人現正期待談判之進展，余將不放棄希望，直至吾人認爲無從爲力爲止。」的話，他的話是兌現了。確實前面道路崎嶇，障碍重重，他們依舊要提起精神，拿出勇氣，向前邁進，尋求中國的和平。</p>
<p>可是，在「八一三」的那天，延安的廣播給予兩位老人一個很嚴重的打擊。我們一方面痛恨共黨的不近情理，一方面對兩位使者獻出加倍的敬仰，同時告訴他們，我們是始終在擁護他們，作他們的後盾，爲的是「我們需要和平」。</p>
<p>主席的文告</p>
<p>「八一四」主席的文告，在這高山上散佈出去的前後，山上的談話，記者們的訊問，政府專員們的表示，無不對此有關。但結論都是一樣：今日渴望和平者莫如國民政府，今日爭盼和平而感受困難者亦莫如國民政府。可是，現在可以告訴國人的，和平之門還是大開，只要共黨放棄其以少數黨來控制國命的野心，則和平統一，民主建設，必能達到最後的目的。不但我國同胞對這文告珍視，擁護，即國外各方輿論，亦一致贊同其實行六項方針，願意繼續協助中央政府。</p>
<p>這文告在另一方面看，亦可根據之而作三個對照：第一，共黨對於和平談判，毫無誠意，態度強硬，要求無理；而主席文告則誠懇溫和，表示出坦白正大的精神。第二，延安的廣播，明顯地在破壞馬帥和司徒大使的調處，拒絕他們爲和平奔走的協助；而「文告」則正相反，它明白地請求馬·司繼續爲着全中國的同胞求得安定，解除痛苦，同時寫實地表示政府依舊對和平前途抱着希望。第三，「八一四」文告內容實際並非根據馬司聲明而發表，但文告中所說的當前困難，也正是馬司聲明中所提到的困難，可見各方面的看法是一致的。其實這個困難也很簡單，而不難解決的。政府最高的希望，即在取得共黨的合作，實現本年一月以來成立的三大協議，而最低的要求，在共產黨撤出足以威脅和平妨碍交通的地區，和恢復交通。</p>

<h3>在廬山看政局　上文接第一版</h3>
<p>曾琦的上山　正在這個優持的局面之下，青年黨的領袖曾琦來到山上，對中華時報十一日社評建議「召集一個全國性的談話會，應使其確能代表全國民意」表示贊同。同時，從記者們各方面探聽所得綫索，政府亦正有意思想召集各大學校長及省市參議長來牯作一種不拘形式的談話，以探集各方面的意見。這樣一來，全咕嶺為之轟動，連日來記者們整日到處奔走，在秋天一般的　山依舊跑得汗流浹背，就是為了這件大事。然而，直到今天，還沒有得到一個給論，有人認為可能性很大，有人覺得此事不容易辦到，有人承認確有其事，有人鄭重否認，結果，反而弄得混亂不堪，傳說紛紜，對這種談話的本性也許己失去正確瞭解，終之，記者們也被攪得糊塗起來了，但也有人這樣解釋：也許主席陸續召見各方人士來山商談，即是在進行這工作也說不定。但不管有否此事實，所以會造成這種種值得全國上下注目的一問題，亦無非是表現了人們在這萬分苦悶的階段中，希望求得一種可以打開僵局的好辦法，一方面也是心理上的反應。</p>
<p>馬帥的再來　恰巧在大家不得不把談話會捉摸不定的空氣暫時鬆懈︸下的時候馬帥匆匆地又四登廬山。毫無疑問的，誰都不肯放鬆緊緊地注意看馬帥此行，尤其是宋院長於同時來山，不時來回於主席和馬帥行館間綠色小橋上那副忙綠的樣子，真令人不緊張也要緊張起來。而且馬帥此次來山後，已明顯地告訴我們，這是他四上匡廬最緊張的一次，甚至吃飯都不能安心下來，難怪旁觀者下意識的感到：「目前的局勢的確到了最嚴重的關頭了！」可惜記者們，甚至政府高級人員都無法得到絲毫關於主席和馬帥的談話內容，於是大家免不了作一番非正式的猜測：「也許可能繼續探求一互相讓步的辦法，以打開眼前的僵局……也許……但這次談話要作一個最後的決定，大概是將有問題的吧！」。但一切始終是個「謎」！</p>
<p>記者的苦况　最近，牯嶺的要員來來去去又似乎與二星期前大不相同了，以前是幾天來一位，這幾天卻是一天來幾位。敏感而可憐的記者們又不得不挖空心思，動動腦筋了，他們是為了參加談話會的嗎？為了……？其實，有幾位確是不折不扣專為向主席報告施政情形而來的。但前一個時期是「院長」和元老們上山時期，最近是「部長」上山時期，這似乎是有點意思的。</p>
<p>這兩個多星期來，最苦而有時苦的沒有理由的，還是新聞記者，無論在發動「神經戰」，實行「神經戰」或「凱旋歸來」，或「戰敗退回」，一直到「如何能把消息寫得恰到好處」，再到「聲嘶力竭」，疾呼電話完畢放心為止，不知費盡了多少心血，傷盡多少腦筋，經一堆亂蔴中，抽出一個頭緒來，從變化萬　的局勢中，企圖找出一些真實的事態來。</p>
<p>今後的進政目標又是什麽呢？不敢胡猜，但也不能不放在腦子裏作個準備，可能是決定應該下怎末樣一只最後的棋子吧！可能是討論如何來作成一個完善可行的憲章，為將來提交國民大會討論之準備，然後制定憲法，對擴大政府基礙問題，可達到圓滿的解決。</p>
<p>在牯嶺看政局，正和看廬山的雲霧沒有分別，一會兒伸手不見五指，一會兒山明水秀，眼前頓時一亮，千變萬化，真是令人捉摸不定。（完）</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>一年來國共商談的總結</h3>
<p>合眾社十九日南京電：據張家口電台廣播，延安不僅已頒發動員令，而且已公然宣佈戰爭狀態的存在。雖南京的中共代表團尚稱並無所聞，但證以大同圍攻的加緊與隴海路東段的大戰，則中共之欲憑藉武力，擴充地盤，奪取政權，己成為路人皆知的事實。政府雖苦心孤詣，仍希望政治問題能獲致和平解決，馬帥和司徒大使雖咋日先後返京，將再作斡旋，以挽救最後的危機，但瞻望國內政局未來的發展，由於中共的蓄謀已久，師承有自，今天殆成騎虎之勢，要盼它懸崖勒馬，恐難祇有千百分之一的希望了。</p>
<p>回想到一年之前的今日，日寇剛剛無條件投降，舉國狂歡慶祝，光明美麗的理想，在每一個人民的眼前閃鑠，而今竟有近乎幻滅的氣象了！</p>
<p>當日寇投降之初，蔣主席看到了中共軍事頭腦朱德的越軌電報，就深知共產黨問題的嚴重，如果不能早日獲致解決方案，則後患無窮，特三次電約中共領袖毛澤東赴渝會晤，共商和平建國的大計。毛氏在去年八月廿八日抵渝，曾與蔣主席會談多次，至十月十日告一段落，雖未獲致重大成就，但商得了一個共同原則，就是：國共雙方均「在蔣主席領導之下，長期合作，堅決避免內戰，建設獨立自由和富强的新中國，澈底實行三民主義。」雙方又同意「蔣主席所倡導之政治民主化，軍隊國家化，及黨派平等合法，為達到和平建國自由之途徑。」這個共同原則，見之於「雙十會談紀要」，本來應即作為雙方繼續進行談判的基礎。可惜中共並不願擴大這和平談判的基礎，却在利用軍事上的優勢，到處與政府「爭降」，不僅阻撓國軍開入熱河，而且還在蘇北及山東一帶蠢動，乘機充實軍力，鞏固地盤。後來因為受不了國人一致的譴責，中共始與政府同時頒發停止衝突的命令，同時又與政府各黨派暨社會賢達，在渝舉行政治協商會議，就（一）和平建國綱領，（二）政府組織，（三）軍事問題，（四）國民大會，（五）憲法草案等五項問題，詳加討論，經過二十餘天的辯論，總算完成了一部中國和平建國的大憲章，軍隊國家化與政治民主化都有同時實現的希望，使全國各處都充滿了一片祥和光明的景象。接着軍隊整編及統編中共部隊為國軍的基本方案也簽字了，一般人都以為軍隊國家化的實現，也更有確實的把握。</p>
<p>但是在人民慶幸政協成功之後，人民的希望，又因為共產黨到處騷擾而歸於泡影了。中共不僅在熱河·遼密·河北·山西·山東·河南·湖北·以及皖北·蘇北，爭城奪地，而且蓄心破壞全國的鐵路公路交通，以阻撓政府接收及復員工作的完成，到二月杪，中共的野心更變本加厲，又在東北假借東北聯軍的名義，造成地方割據的局面，再加以蘇聯軍隊撤退問題的久懸不決，使這個問題益形微妙與複雜，使我們的友邦也覺得中國內政問題的嚴重而深感不安。及至四月初旬，蘇畢撤退回國，中共部隊乃乘國軍實力空虛，相繼攻佔長春，哈爾濱，大有席捲整個東北之勢，同時又破壞北寗路，阻擾平瀋通車，使東北局勢陷於更混亂的狀態。馬歇爾特使雖然竭智盡能，從中調處，並幾次三番向中共要求，「退出長春，交還中央軍隊接防，以彼再談其他的問題。」可是中共始終不願接受。東北本來不在軍事調處的範圍之內，但政府忍讓為國，承認調處，只要不妨礙國軍接收主權的工作。可見共軍圍攻長春，久佔不退，這不是中共背約失信破壞協議最顯著的事實嗎？因中共製造了東北的衝突，而戰亂遂日益擴大，責任誰屬，不煩多說。</p>
<p>然而中外人士只是盼望東北衝突的早日停止，依然不再追問是非，蔣主席也為和平建國的前途計，不惜委曲求全，乃於六月六日頒發東北停戰令，限於十五日內談判恢復交通及實施軍隊復員及整編統編方案等項問題，可是到了期滿的一天，仍未商得結果，蔣主席又下令延長八天，中共的最後機會應該重視。但是在最後的八天內，共產黨依然玩弄它最高明的手法，使談判拖延下去，得不到一個結論。弄得熱心奔走和平的馬帥與司徒大使也束手無策，不得不暫時停止調處工作。</p>
<p>在上面這個簡單的敍述裏，可知我國戰亂的發生，在人民的眼光中，中共應負其責任。在談判的過程中，中共還侈談和平，高唱「無條件停戰」，僅在暗中偷偷摸摸的幹想以一手掩蓋天下的耳目。等到美兵被綁，美兵被襲，延安廣播反美，我們就預測中共已到了圖窮七見的地步了。今天中共索性撕破了假面具，公然宣佈動員令，公然宣佈戰爭狀態的存在，在我們看透中共作風的中國人民眼光中，實在沒有什麽奇怪。所可詫異的，中共這種陰狠毒辣的作法，是有所師承的，而還會有若干不明瞭中國真相的友人，以及糊塗馬虎的「中立者」，受中共的欺騙，在那裏做着中共或有一天可以無條件停戰的夢！</p>
<p>至於講到政府方面，在軍事上一直處於被動的地位。所堅持的，僅要中共停止軍事進攻，停止破壞交通，以及實行軍隊的整編與統編而已。蔣主席始終本着和平統一的方針，相忍為國，力求國內問題獲致政治解決。政府在政協會閉幕之後，對於政治民主化，確具有絕大決心，期望於國民大會於五月五日召開，制定憲法，以走上憲政的正軌。可是中共最初爭代表名額的多寡，最後竟拒不出席，因此國民大會不得不延期舉行。一直到七月三日，國防最高委員會始決定於本年十一月十二日召開國民大會，並確認政協會決議案繼續有效。蔣主席最近昭告全國同胞，亦重言申明政府必將如期召開國民大會，遵守政協會決議案，擴大政府基礎，仍採取政治方式解決內爭。政府既已探取「盡其在我」的主動精神，但願能從肅清貪污，整飭政治，提高行政效率，解除人民痛苦，切實着手，則民心向背，顯然可見。</p>
<p>老實講，共黨在中國之蔓延，一部分原因乃政治舉措為淵驅魚的結果，並不是共黨能得人民的擁護。但自從共黨在山東蘇北一帶自掘墳墓而後，也可以說共黨幫了政府的大忙，只要政府好自為之，今天收拾人心，容易極了！我們始終以為政治解決，決不僅僅指與中共進行談判而言的，當年蔣主席所昭示的「三分軍事七分政治」的原則，解決目前國內的政治問題還是適用。這是中國問題政治解決的出路，也是我們老百姓對於政府唯一的希望！</p>

<h3>美國與南斯拉夫軍隊處於半戰爭狀態</h3>
<p>特港佔領區內兩軍曾數度發生衝突美兩次照會南國措詞嚴厲</p>
<p>〔本報綜合消息〕義大利及南斯拉夫邊境之特里埃斯特港，曾成爲巴黎外長會議中激烈爭辯之問題，後經各方同意暫時置於國際共管之下，英美及南斯拉夫俱派有軍隊駐紥，各劃防區。但近兩月來，雙方已數度發生小規模衝突，並曾互致照會抗議。據聯合社華盛頓電，十九日，美國忽勃然揭穿與南斯拉夫之關係，顯露特里埃斯特所駐美軍已與南斯拉夫軍處於半戰爭狀態。國務院今日發表致南斯拉夫照會兩件，指辭嚴厲，爲歴來所罕見。指責南軍曾於六月十九日及卅日，又於七月十二日及十三日非法侵入美軍或英軍佔領區及無故攻擊美軍，並曾於六月十九日」次發生血戰。此項照會並列舉南斯拉夫對軍政府挑還行爲九起，並不惜歪曲事實，表示對軍政府之不滿，南斯拉夫政府似企間推翻特里埃斯時聯合國軍政府，造成經濟之衝突，挑撥親南斯拉夫居民之感情，並恐嚇親義大利之居民。此項照會雖尙未提及美機在奧地利與義大利之間被南斯拉夫截擊事，但此間官員正在密切調査常時情形，私下表示極度憤慨。美高級外交當局以爲西方聯合國在經濟上打擊南斯拉夫，時間已到。南斯拉夫與蘇聯關係密切，並曾接獲聯總之助甚多。此種局勢能否保持，而不致於大規模公開衝突，此間認爲並無把握。蘇聯對於南總統蒂托任何極端行動，足以牽涉東西兩方之直接衝突者，是否願爲支援，此間高級官員亦認爲不無可疑。同時，據路透社倫敦二十日電，英政府亦同時公佈五月二十日及八月十四日致南斯拉夫之兩照會，內容係以最强硬之措辭，駁斥南官方所述義南邊界盟國軍政府及斯拉夫官員衝突之情形。權威方面謂英政府相信南國發表與事實不符之衝突情形，意在使世界人士不信任當地之盟國軍政府，其最後目的則在影響巴黎和會對於特里雅斯特區之決定。英國認爲特港若在聯合國之監督下設立自由區，必須有眞正獨立之地位，其中最重要之發展，即爲舉行第一次選舉。於此乃發生是否應由盟國軍政府監督之問題，故軍政府之政績，對於和會之決定，具有重大影響。英國認南斯拉夫必反對由盟國軍政府監督首次選舉，因此遂不惜惡意宣傳，以破壞軍政府之聲譽。</p>
<h3>韃靼尼爾問題</h3>
<p>美對蘇覆牒發出同意修改條約反對蘇土聯防英法兩國產塲大致與美相同</p>
<p>〔本報粽合消息〕關於士耳其韃靼尼爾海峽問題，據聯合社業盛頓電，美政府已於二十日以照會一件送交蘇駐美大使館參贊奧律科夫，表明美國對韃海峡，所持態度。土京美國大使館亦同時將美政府立塲轉達土耳其政府，據合衆社華盛頓電，美國務院方面十九日消息，美國現已草就對蘇照會，主張由聯合國共同參預修改蒙德婁公約並反對蘇聯之觀點。此項照會之草擬，係由杜魯門總統於白宮召集會議，參加者有國務卿貝爾納斯·陸長柏德遜·海長福萊斯特爾·及海陸軍高級將領數人。</p>
<p>牒文內容包含四點</p>
<p>美國照會之包容，衆信將內括下列數點：（一）美國準備參加任何關於修改蒙德業公約之討論，（二）美國認爲，海峽問題無論組織任何機構，皆應與聯合國發生關係，蓋蒙德婁公約本係在前國際聯盟之下成立，以保證土耳其之中立者；（三）美國反對此種人之看法，即認爲韃靼尼爾僅爲一與黑海諸國有關之間題；（四）美國反對蘇聯之觀點，即認爲海峽之防衛僅係蘇土兩國之事。該次照會，聞已準備就緒，現正由國務院數高級人員硏　中，因此事極關重要，故必須縝密硏討，方予送出也。</p>
<p>據路透社倫敦電英國或將於四十八小時內，就修改蒙德婁條約事，向蘇聯遞送照會，衆料大致與之採同樣態度。一方面英駐土大使二十日曾以照會一件，送達土國外交部，說明英國對於海峽問題之見解，照會內容雖未透露，但開土國官方極表滿意，可見當是支持土國立塲者。至於法國方面，據法國新聞社巴黎十九日電，法政府已訓令該國駐英，美，蘇，土，四國大使，將法國對於韃靼尼爾海峽問題所處立塲，分別通知各國。按此項訓令，係於上星期抄發出，內容略謂，法國政府準備參加修正蒙德婁公約，但應依照原來協定之規定加以修正。</p>

<h3>百卅一歲老翁抽大學茄穿聯邦服自稱故門羅總統公子</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約二十日電〕美國第五任大總統門羅，爲作家及著名門羅主義（即禁止歐人干涉美洲事務）創導者，舉世咸知其無子，不謂本日紐約各報登載消息，謂有詹姆斯門羅少校者，業已到達紐約，其人不僅自稱生於一八一五年，（即至今一百三十一歲）且自稱爲門羅總統公子，一般人爲之將信將疑。按之大英百科全書所載門羅小傳，僅稱故總統生有二女，並無公子。該門羅少校異常機警，吸一長大學茄烟，穿着聯邦時代衣服，被體格訓練專家麥克法登之廣吿掮客在佛羅里達州發現，當即用飛機載至紐約，而公開出現於報界之前·其人之來歷固有可疑之處，但其高齡則無人置疑，因其在廿八年前度共一百零三歲誕辰時，美國雜誌界已引爲奇聞。據門羅少校稱：渠生平曾娶三妻，均已亡故，生有子女十一人，去年又墮入情網，幾乎第四次結婚。此間一般人成謂：不管此人來歷如何，觀其公開出現於報界之前，實爲一種富於噱頭之廣吿也去。</p>
<h3>我代表向和會提議國際共管義屬地　草約修正要求截至昨午夜期滿大會改今日舉行貝文將任主席</h3>
<p>〔本報綜合消息〕據合衆社訊：全會原定於今日舉行，聽取埃及，墨西哥，古巴，阿爾巴尼亞與奧地利之意見，旋因阿爾巴尼亞代表團未能及時趕到故不得不展期至星期三舉行貝文外相大約將輪値主席。據巴黎廣播：奧外長格魯貝爾二十日已抵巴黎，將於明日出席和會全會陳述意見。所擬申述者將注重於蒂洛爾省區南部之人民問題。格魯貝爾特別指出謂，奧國對蒂洛爾之日耳曼人民問題曾屢向四强外長會議及廿一國和會提出備忘錄。奧國並無從事擴張領士政策之要求，惟請和會覓取公正與滿意之解決辦法。</p>
<p>今日義大利委員會開會，經二小時之討論後，該委員會同意維辛斯基之建議，即先行考慮對義和約之序文，以及義代表團所提出之備忘錄。其後會議即並無進展，因一切實際工作之進行，須俟各方在今日午夜時限前，提出修正案之後。席間彼蘭與荷蘭代表，對於義國代表團所稱義國並未與義大利委員會之二十個會員國中之四國宣戰一點，曾陳辭予以抨擊。據法國新聞社巴黎訊：中國首先以義大利和平草約之修正案，送達和會秘書處，以供養和約各小組委員會討論。中國代表團向義大利政治及領土委員會所提之修正案，主張前義大利各殖民地歸國際管理，此案早經中國代表在和會全體大會中提出，但遭遇法國之反對。和會休息室中人士傳說，截至目前爲止，對義大利和平草約提出修正案者，僅有中國南斯拉夫及荷蘭三國。</p>
<p>義致送備忘錄要求修正序文</p>
<p>義大利要求在草約序文中，提及任何戰爭時，以「若干」聯合國爲限，而非全體聯合國，並特別規定義人民被法西斯政權「導入」戰爭。南斯拉夫代表批評義大利修正案之精神，在消滅義大利戰爭責任，使與現政權不生任何關係，此點完全不能接受。據巴黎廣播：義代表國送致和會秘書處之備忘錄，係洋洋一巨帙，其中要求修正和約序文，强調對義業經認予之非交戰國性質·關於特港及維尼哥亞求里亞問題，要求對四强外長會議所擬國際化方案予以修改，認為該國際區尤應予以擴大，將若干城鎭，例如現歸南斯拉大之波拉包括在內。至於法義邊界問題，亦曾約略提及。義國屬地盼勿包括和約之內，因屬地命運迄仍未有決定。另一方面，在屬地之將來命運未決前，表示其重返非洲屬地之意。對於經濟方面之條款，義國提出甚多之　解。義國代表團對丹吉爾方面義國之權利，尤表示有收回之意。</p>
<p>審議和約草案爭論多收穫少</p>
<p>今日開會之另一委員會，爲羅馬尼亞政治委員會，但開會不及一小時，即吿休會，因英代表反對法代表所提開始討論對羅和約之動議，認爲此事須在各項修正案將集竣事後，再行着手硏究。昨日和會有六個委員會開會，其唯一成就，即顯示各委會尙須經過一星期冗長之辯論，逐條審査五種和約草案之工作，在下星期前似尙無法着手進行。昨日各委會開會達十二小時以上，但所討論者，僅限學輪和約草案中何項塵屬於各該員會討論範圍之內，和約序文或若干條款是否塵着手討論等茫無頭緒之問題，實際收機，幾等於零。</p>
<p>美與伊朗代表會外舉行商談</p>
<p>昨日美國務　員爾納斯在其寓所，與伊朗外長拉尼瑪有所商談，據巴黎外交界消息，兩人所討論者，係關於庫齊斯坦油區發生混亂後所造成之伊朗新危機。，蓋英方因該方面局勢不穩，已在伊拉克之巴斯拉港增强兵力，並傳蘇聯因英國之行動而在伊朗北部邊境集中大量軍隊。此外，貝爾納斯與伊朗外長曾論及伊朗在全會中對義大利和約準備陳述之意見。至於會談詳情，並未有所透露。</p>

<h3>日工業總崩潰已無法避免　通貨膨脹增速物價飛升糧食無着失業人數激增</h3>
<p>〔本報東京特派員傅俊義二十日電〕據此間報載：日本工業將在下牛年總崩潰。爲了原料缺少·財政失調·及工潮澎湃，大規模的企業將無力繼續。據工商省統計，廿五種主要工業的生產設備，百分之四十遭損壞，而十種以上工業如紡織·碳·水泥·鹼·及水電，則損失百分之三十的設備。</p>
<p>要重建日本工業，除非賠款失業及通貨膨脹各項問題有了解決。假使日前情形不進步，工業全部停頓不過是時間問題。貨幣發行額的增加將不可免，生產增加將無望，糧食問題將繼續存在，結果物價將再上漲。據日本銀行權威觀察：貨幣發行到九月底將增至七千二百萬萬圓，到十二月底增至九千三百三十萬萬。物價已漲到戰前十二倍，黑市價目則爲戰前一百倍。如糧荒繼續而日政府不變其經濟政策。則因戰敗而起的經濟危機或可能在十一月發生。</p>
<p>據日厚生大臣稱：失業人數已達二百五十萬；如包括退伍軍人及遣回日僑則總數爲五百萬人。重建的民營企業可收容一百三十萬人，但要全部解決失業則非常困難。糧食問題在八九日間仍極危急，因爲天氣雖適宜，而肥料缺乏。比較樂觀的人估計，雖然肥料不足，收成亦可達六千萬貫（等於四萬九千六百二十九斗）而另一部份人估計則爲五千二百萬至五千三百萬貫，近來此間盛傳糧食配給將增至三go，月前所定之二三go恐將變更。</p>
<h3>日本賠償會議前夕一般情勢的分析　美尚未接獲蘇聯覆文擬就計劃須待關係國共同決定</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社二十日電〕日本賠償會戚定於下月初旬或月底在美國舉行，遠東委員會已以美政府名義，柬邀關係各國政府參加，要求於本片十五日以前答復。被邀各國除蘇聯外，均已　該一日期以前答復，蘇聯是否接受邀請，尙未可知。華府官方人士希望蘇聯出以任何答復，因蘇聯若果答復，則不得不對於口本士以外之日人所有資產問題，採取決定的立塲故也。蘇聯諉稱山國東九省以前日人所有資產乃爲「戰利品」，此說決不爲遠東委會十一國中之大多數所擁護，殆可斷言。截至目前爲止，蘇聯力言中國本部及東九省之日人資產，不應列入日本對聯合國賠償項目之內。美賠償專員最近曾考察全世界返國，據其估計，蘇聯將東九省價値二十萬萬元之日人資產運往蘇聯，未微聯合國方面同意，蘇聯諉稱此項工業設備爲「戰利品」。另一方面，中國對於本國境內日本人建立之工業設備，不得不與其他聯合國分享一層，並不焦慮。美當局爲應付此種情勢起見，已草其「臨時計劃」，依照該項計劃，賠償會議倘不按期舉行，則賠償項目下之日本工業設備，當以百分之二十撥歸東印度·菲律賓·及太平洋其他區域。但此一計劃並不摒絕賠償會議日後召開之可能性，因日本之賠償問題不能由片面決定，需要共同決定，亦唯其共同決定，乃能獲致未來東方整個經濟生命之安定。</p>

<h3>溥儀述偽滿內幕　關東軍以鴉片毒化東北是移民廿年間共六百萬</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京二十電〕傀儡溥儀今日續在遠東國際法庭，答覆檢察長季楠之直接詰質。據稱：關東軍保證人民禁止鴉片，但反而使其成每年廿萬萬元之商業·此乃凈利，日人甚至公然出售吸煙許可證。彼等開始發展東北種殖罌粟之兩省，煙毒推廣之後，罌粟之佈種，遍及其他三省，關東軍決心破壞中國之士氣，摧殘中國人之健康，使其無反抗侵略之機會。東北十八歲至四十五歲之人民，均須服役，爲日軍建築公路及開礦等，如有企圖逃役者，必受嚴懲。待遇中國勞工惡劣之極，病時無藥，衣服單薄，居處簡陋不堪。食物稀少且汚穢，非人所食。日人利用東北人力及出產，使東北成爲其兵工廠·二十年間，日人移入柬北者六百萬名，攫奪居田民地，僞幣在日本印刷，强迫東北人民通用云。</p>

<h3>美超空堡壨作宇宙綫測驗飛行</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十九日電〕美陸軍航空隊今日宣佈：將與軍事科學家會同探測宇由綫之神秘性俾使其成爲原子力之新源泉。B．29型超空堡壘一架定今日自台頓飛往波斯頓，載運特種設備及技師，然後從事最廣泛之飛行。另有超空堡壘一架，名一飛行實驗室」·上星期已完成加拿大至南美洲之宇宙綫實騐飛行，此次實騐與全國地理學會及巴都爾實騐基金委員會合辦。軍事科學家之實驗，將由羅西博士領導，深入地球大氣中宇宙綫分裂所產生之能力質點。其中一部份較原子彈分裂質點之力量增加數百萬倍，但此種力量是否可以應用，則成疑問。如屬可能，即足使科學界充分利用原子核，以前則未完全應用。此種能力如能發展，鈾質以外之原子亦可用以產生力量云。</p>
<h3>美全國水閘工程之父老議員瑙雷斯（下）　畢生盡瘁於水利事業</h3>
<p>— 本報美特派員毛樹清</p>
<p>一九三二年大選的那年，瑙雷斯，化了畢生最大的力量，替羅斯福鼓吹，他旅行了很多州，在每一個州演說，要國民投票給羅斯福，這一回瑙氏却勝利了。羅斯福在十一月選舉獲勝，十二月就和瑙雷斯坐火車到田納西，他們望著田納西河的波濤汹湧，憧憬著這未來偉大的水利事業，非常的歡欣，羅斯福跨在江邊的岩石上，很悠閒的抽出一支雪茄，邊吸邊說：「喬治（瑙之小名）今天該是你最快樂的時候了吧？」「是的，該是我畢生最快樂的時候了，我的夢想畢竟有機會實現了！」羅斯福感動得渾身激動，他說：「感謝上帝！一個</p>
<p>不平凡的總統</p>
<p>就要懂得怎樣做夢！」一九三三年四月十日，羅斯福總統對國會上下兩院演說，盛道瑙雷斯的偉大理想及計劃，五月十八日，總統簽署了TVA法案。從一九三三年TVA在田納西州成立起，瑙雷斯的全部心血，都集中在那兒，雖然他沒有負實際責任，事實上，他是一個TVA無形中的最高指導者。他和三位　事，經常保持聯絡，商決大計。他親自坐著汽車至看水閘工程，他親眼君見一座一座水閘的完成。TVA爲紀念他英勇的奮鬥，第一座落成的水閘，便叫做，瑙雷斯水閘，因爲水閘而將荒山改造成爲的城鎭</p>
<p>便叫瑙雷斯鎭</p>
<p>瑙雷斯並非田納西州人，但因爲他的功業，田納西人都感載他，瑙雷斯的名字，現在成爲田納西許多旅館商店的招牌，成爲許多街道的名稱。在田納西，隨處可以看到瑙雷斯的相片，一個苦幹誠篤的老年人·</p>
<p>瑙雷斯已不在人間了！他死於前年（一九四四）夏天，他死的時候，戰爭還沒有結束，但他已經知道，TVA的大量電力，已經替勝利奠立了基石。死前幾天，總工程師吿訴他：「最後一座肯塔基水閘，已經落成了，」他覺得一生的資任，已經完滿的吿一段落。瑙雷斯的肉體死了，他的精神，他的功業，得到了水生！我在諾城TVA總部的圖書館裏，被指定著看參考書。我發現很多有關瑙雷斯的傳記，這篇通訊，摘自奈堡格和凱恒合寫的「完整人格瑙雷斯」，李夫寫的「爲民主奮鬥的璃雷斯，」以及瑙雷斯先生的自傳「我爲自由奮鬥。」（完）</p>

<h3>加爾各答印回教徒流血大衝突經過　木棍石塊爲武器死傷纍纍武裝軍警全體出動施彈壓</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社新德里十九日電〕據加爾各答目擊此次騷動事件者談稱：回敎聯盟舉行「直接行動」，城內所有商店一律停業，本月十六日淸晨回敎徒羣集街頭，向印度敎徒襲擊。午前九時自和葛烈河右岸至巴利根琪住宅區一帶多處發生騷動，此項消息傳佈迅速，印度敎徒即結隊遊行，手持木棍向市中心前進，回敎徒執有圓，敎聯盟之綠旗，亦行向該處。同時有回敎徒約三百名奔赴公園街，搗毁所有印度敎徒商店，並將店主扭住毒打，於是秩序大亂，到處搶刧。旋有警察騎巡隊趕到，將長竹鞭向發羣衆亂打，暴徒四散，但見受傷者數十人躺於地上，忽另有大批回敎徒自別處衝來，即向警察反攻，警察以寡不敵衆，有若干名自馬上拖下，羣衆即以足踐踏，旋亦散去。是時多處發生類似事件，警察因不敷分配，不足以應付。正午十二時警察始用催淚彈，並向暴徒開槍，午後三時至六時間，警察未繼續干涉僅駐守若干地點，而印回敎徒衝突不已。直至傍晚，警察再行出巡，但見街頭死傷纍纍，遂即加以收拾。夜間又聞槍聲，及救護車救火車之鈴聲，市郊亦有衝突。是日傍晚，若干回敎徒來自各處，散處荒涼之市街兩旁，略相交談，即羣向某印度敎徒雜貨店衝去，排關血入，店主乃一老人，即被拉住，其子則已逸走，暴徒以石塊向老人擊去，見其頭顱破裂逐一散去。然印度敎徒之殘忍，亦不稍遜，渠等曾將回敎徒二人痛加鞭韃，奄奄待斃，乃以牛車就其身上輾過，翌日仍有血案發生，公務機關暫吿解散，電話不通，警察局之警報亦不復聞，暴徒見有警察即行竄去。警察當局應付此次騷動，殊感力量不足，幸有軍隊協助，漸能鎭壓。聞回敎軍隊若干團以其行動不可靠，留在軍營內不許外出。至於歐洲人並不遭受任何損傷，有若干外人常衝突發生時仍徘徊街頭，無人注意。目前加爾各答與別處電報電話交通均已斷絕，陷於孤立狀態之中。</p>

<h3>各業加強本身組織　配合經済革新政策　市商會召開談話會中重要提議　共謀協助政府維持物價平穩</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市商會以政府調整　率，擬輿各業公會，共同合作，維持物價起見，特於昨日下午五時，召集各有關同業公會，舉行談話會。到徐寄廣，金潤庠，　景偉，葛傑臣，潘士浩，屠　徽，嚴諤聲，社會局長代表顧炳元，及各業問業公會負責人等，共約一百餘人。首由商會理事長徐寄廣致詞，略稱：今日會議，一方面係爲報吿此次工商請顧團請願經過，一方面係因政府改訂匯率，目的在振興工商業，刺激出口品，惟　物價，勿因此而隨漲，致辜負政府調整滙率之一番善意，故特召集各有關同業公會談話。望切實與政府合作，維持平穩之物價。今日會見吳市長時，據吿昨日西藥在漲百分之八十，糖價亦激漲，故著切實　　，公體政府決策，努力抑平物價，均勿任意抬價。旋由金潤庠，壽景偉，潘士浩三氏分別報吿工商請願團晋京請願經過。</p>
<p>深望善用　議價制度</p>
<p>顧炳元致詞，略稱：政府此次調整匯率，取消出口稅，裨益工商界及出口業，實匪淺鮮，惟望各業，勿因調整匯率，而形慌張，以免招致各種窒礙。如因匯率提高，而將物價亦隨以提高，則調整匯率所獲之效果，將完全消失。且物價無理高漲後，職工生活指數遞增，又將影響於生產成本。故深望各業公會，應善爲運用現行之議價制度，在合法利潤範圍之內，切望愼重議具平廉之物價，萬勿從事黑市交易，不然，當局爲安定民生計，只有採取干涉政策。現政府方面有權處置之各物品，如紡建之紗布，台糖公司之食糖，決仍維持原價不漲。故望各業亦體察政府決心，維持平穩物價，利用現時外貨趨漲之良機，推銷國貨。各業應自動的協助政府，將物價平抑，俾便政府保護工商界之各項政策，得以逐步實施。</p>
<p>駱清華氏　提議兩點</p>
<p>駱清華氏因病不能到會，有函到會，由嚴　聲誦讀。該函提議兩點：（一）如何遵照新同業公會法，加强本身組織，配合政府經濟革新政策，以求貫淸，俾收實效。（二）如何整頓各業之同業業規，憑藉新公會法，賦予各公會之職權，運用組織力量，由各業重行分別修訂業規（明定違約罰則）。</p>
<p>新藥增價　仍不敷本</p>
<p>新藥業代表稱：自調整外匯後，新藥業公會中重要會員，並未有將藥價抬高至百分之八十之事。惟現以未入會之新藥同業頗多，且尤以攤販爲多，售價遂漫無標準。惟同業中昨日開門應市時，顧客　擁而來，大多搜購各種外貨補藥及日用藥品，實感無法應付。現各種外貨新藥，平均約漲百分之五至廿。以黃凡士林言，成本約合二百四十餘元一磅。外洋亦以到貨極多，價乃慘跌至成本以內，每磅僅二百元。以昨日市價言，每磅亦不過二百廿元至二百六十元。他如瑞士羅氏汽巴等藥廠出品，自滙率調整後，已紛紛提漲百分之六十，故新藥業中目前雖有若干外貨已增價，惟仍不敷本。甚望建立議價制度，制止市價之暴漲暴落。</p>
<p>糖業代表　陳述困難</p>
<p>糖業代表稱：批發商一個月來所領購到會糖公司第九期及第十期食糖，總共不過二萬五千包。現値夏令，食糖去路較旺。批發商方面，大多每包均加合汰利潤七千元，即吿脫售。此事重點，尙在台糖公司之不能儘最配售，且食糖又不能自由販賣。否則，糖價可望自然趨廉。渠稱：今日吳市長召見時，又飭令負責取締食糖黑市，當盡力勸諭同業照辦。惟現時向本會申請爲會員者，日必數起。且聞此項新同業，如取得社會局登記證後，即發生法律上之效力，故頗感應付爲難。關於此點，社會局顧炳元氏特提出解釋，略稱：台糖公司每期配售食糖，必由社會局商妥配售辦法，照每市担七萬元之限價配出。惟各糖商得糖後，亦有隨意處理之事發生。是同業公會本身管理，顯見不甚完密，政府即有加以管理之必要。蓋政府旣以平價糖配售，切望使各市民能普遍受惠。現社會局正考慮再改善配售辦法，務望各糖商獲得食糖後，勿囤貯拒售。至新糖行之紛紛設立及入會事宜，糖業公會及社會局，均應負責。公會方面，應切實調査各新會員之資歷，如有不正當處，應儘量通知社會局，當不發給登記證。</p>
<p>旋由馬少荃，第四區麵粉業代表紙業代表啤酒業代表等紛紛陳詞。最後決議二項：（一）請各業公會，分別召集所屬會員同業，切實會商維持平價之原則。（二）駱淸華氏提議兩則，提議商會當務理事會組織小組會硏究。</p>
<p>散會前，市商會秘書長嚴　聲氏，附帶報告：前商會分發各業公會塡報之所利得稅表，共二百四十餘份，惟迄目前爲止，僅收到一百餘份，故望尚未送到之各業公會，從速填報，以憑彙辦。</p>
<p>徐堪接見　粉業代表</p>
<p>徐堪部長昨日上午十時，在糧部駐滬辦事處，接見麵粉廠及麵粉業兩公會代表，規定麵粉業零售利潤，每袋以四百元爲限。</p>
<h3>對當前經済方案　朱斯煌提供意見</h3>
<p>頃據銀行學會秘書長朱斯煌此次新匯率之調整發表意見，略云：按照經濟原理，外匯責，先使進口貨價貴，國內貨物的價格自然跟漲，此乃經濟學自然趨勢，難以躱避。目前務須注意下列幾點：（一）民生日用品務須設法供應。（二）物價不合理之上漲，必須加以抑止，此後物價政策應求平定爲主。（三）對於囤貨者應嚴厲制裁。（四）生產工具進口，應竭力設法，整個貿易政策，應從速確定。總之、此次變動，務希工商界得到實惠，平民不致重受高生活壓迫，勿使少數捷足先得購囤外貨者，造成發財機會。</p>

<h3>盡善盡美</h3>
<p>王韻梅謝家驊劉德明　當選上海小姐</p>
<p>舞后管敏莉歌后韓菁清平劇言慧珠　新仙林盛會空前午夜始散</p>
<p>〔本報特寫〕昨夜在新仙林舞應三千餘人的歡呼聲裏，誕生了抗戰以來第一個上海小姐。王韻稱以六萬五千五百票，當選了「上海小姐」。謝家驊小姐以二萬五千四百三十票，屈居第二，劉德明小姐以八吁五百票居三。難民從她們的仁慈的活動中，因此多得九千九百餘萬的捐款，多救活了許多條可憐的生命。</p>
<p>平劇組當選事后的是言慧珠，得三萬七千七百票。歌后是韓菁淸，得二萬票。舞國皇后是管敏莉，得二萬三千一百五十票。</p>
<p>昨日新仙林舞廳，從大門以至舞應內部，佈置得富麗堂皇，入夜燈彩處處，更顯得奪人眼目。大門上端，懸着「蘇北難民救濟協會上海市籌募委員會園遊大會」紅綢金字橫額。下面吊着四盞紗燈，是「園遊大會」四字。進門便是一隻投票櫃，使人驀地又想起「競選」。沿大門兩側，是收票的職員和幾家報館在這裏贈送着當日報紙。有好些遊客及來賓們在翻閱着本報的「上海小姐特刊」。</p>
<p>順着綠陰夾道的花徑，一轉灣便是廣大平滑的花園舞池。舞池右後側舞廳的大門前搭了一座主席台。台上點綴着盆景，張掛着燈彩。大理石案桌上還放置著瓶花。台前又分置着投票櫃目左起順着序是「舞國皇后」，「平劇皇后」，「上海小姐」，「歌唱皇后」字樣的四只紥着彩綢的木箱，密封着的木蓋各有着三條隙縫，等候著選票的投入。</p>
<p>七時許，汽車流水般不絕地在大門首停下又開走，留下成千成百的嘉賓。未及八時，園內位置幾乎全已坐滿。一時釵光髮影，花枝招展，滿眼是服飾摩登的仕女。她們似穿花蝴蝶般的來去着，造成了空前的熱烈情况。</p>
<p>這時，前次義舞成績優良勝者的給獎典禮，早已在室內舞應裏面開始。先由杜月笙氏致詞，感謝參加上次義舞的舞星們。接着便由社會局長吳開先給獎，熱心義舉的舞聽都獲得了獎狀。舞女們卅餘人各得到了一枚十字榮譽獎章。</p>
<p>鐘嗚八時，樂聲四起，廻光燈三架同時向主席台上照射出强烈的銀光。話筒中發出響亮的聲音，宣布大會開始。台上坐着的是市參議會副議長徐寄廎，社會局李副局長等人。苜由協會總幹事王先靑致詞，略謂：大家此次熱心慈善發揚人類博愛互助精神，本人極爲感舊云云。繼由徐副儀長致詞，他說此次舉行競選、一方面是增加興趣，一方面也是想獲得人類同情心。徐副議長又説現在所救的災是人爲的災，這是非常痛心的，我們應該本着人類同情心，予以援救。徐氏末稱：勝利以後能有此種興致，是很快樂的。李副局長精闢的書辭，首先盛選杜月笙先生對社會救濟事業的貢獻，繼對外界若干批評與誹議，有所解　，闡明競選意義在本人類同情心而達救濟目的，末略述表面的美與內心的美之分別，議美蒼參加競選的小姐們全有偉大的同情，即是內心的美。接着楊嘯天氏也說了話。</p>
<p>當主席台上，幾位主持人發表演詞的時候，台前四隻票　絡續有人投票。而花園裏的旁觀者也在每一刻每一分地增加着，終至於比肩接踵，幾無插足餘地。園子裏草坪上每一個籘桌，坐滿了人，連那台前露天舞池裏也席地坐滿了人。每當人們　現了一個明　　眼的候選人時，立即　上了評頭品足的開觀者，王　梅坐在一架　麥拉下，與二位杜小姐及五六位關中膩友圍在一桌上，這是昨夜新聞的中心。記者川流不息地問訊，美國生活雜誌也找她照了個像。</p>
<p>遊藝節目一個一個接續着過去，有技術表演，有彈唱滑稽，人們聽着，看着，焦急的心中靜待着最後的揭曉。</p>
<p>九時四十五分，有人在話簡中宣布請歌星上台客串，台下的人潮立即捲起熱烈的回聲。催促着二位競選的歌星：韓菁淸與張伊發。先由張唱了支「薔薇處處開」。接着又是幾陣熱烈掌聲，韓菁淸終於姗姗而來，她的低低的銀鈴般的聲音，在話簡中傳出，她說：「蘇北難民太苦了，所以我來參加……」。她應了瘋狂觀衆的高呼，唱了支最所心愛的「蘿蔓娜」。雷一般的掌聲，一陣緊接着一陣，歴久不息……。</p>
<p>時間一分一秒的過去，雖然王邦夫大力士和他的兄妹按　博得了一致讀譽，可是記者們焦灼的心中，　無欣賞的心緒。一分一秒，時間遲遲的過去，王先　總幹事領著五個　潔的難童，介紹他們幸福的遭愚，……可是誰復有這耐心細細傾聽。</p>
<p>十一時十分，終於在千呼萬喚中開票了。先開「上海小姐」。騐過櫃，將櫃搬上主席台，由檢票人監票入檢出選舉票，再將空櫃示衆，一邊便將選票整理出名次來。三千餘條緊張的心弦一致靜候著最後的揭曉，三十餘架　麥拉齊候着小姐的誕生。。</p>
<p>十分鐘後，麥克風裏嘹亮地傳出了競選結果：「王　梅小姐獲選舉六五五〇〇張，當選上海小姐」，亞軍是謝家驊小姐，得二五四三〇票，劉德明小姐，八五〇〇票，潘芝宜小姐，六三七五票，等而下者，便只有五六百票至三四十票不等，當然她們的熱誠救災是一樣値得贊美的。</p>
<p>宣布結果以後，當選的前三名上海小姐俱被請上卞席台，浴在Spoiight的銀光下受開麥拉的注視。正在這時候，巧合地話筒裏傳出了個奇怪的召喚，說是：「杜先生請范紹增軍長上台談話。」這樣呼叫了二遍，失望的是范軍炎並未上台。上海小姐下台去了。</p>
<p>餘下的三組選舉也在萬分緊張的空氣中進行，結果如下：</p>
<p>〔平劇皇后〕言慧珠：得三七七〇〇票，亞后曹慧麟：得一〇六〇〇票。（外有發票二張，共二百票權）（歌星皇后）韓菁淸：得二〇〇〇〇票。亞后張伊雯：得一〇〇〇票。（舞國皇后）管敏莉：得二三一五〇票。亞后顧莉華：得五〇〇票。開票完畢後，全體當選乏「上海小姐」及各組皇后到室內舞廳中攝影，王先靑並公布加免典禮將另擇吉期舉行。園中會塲上遊藝節目還在進行，焰火的火花飛射四散空中，觀衆漸漸散去，半夜歡熱，已成尾聲。</p>
<p>舞后管敏莉</p>
<h3>會場花花絮絮</h3>
<p>上海小姐中，到場最早者爲名媛組王韻梅，王衣墨綠緞子巾袖長旗袍，胸前綫以閃燦之銀片，戴綠色絲手套，一經坐下，即爲記者羣所包圍。</p>
<p>四位皇后髮際皆飾以各色花朶，而以名媛組王韻梅者最爲精彩，該花係由鷄毛製成，染以黃色，花瓣隨風飄搖，遠遠望去，活似鮮　之孔雀毛。</p>
<p>平劇組皇后言　珠說：今天參加競選，並未大事化裝，僅希望到時候來看看熱鬧，若能引人投票，則爲災民之福也</p>
<p>開票前之一刹那空氣極緊張，負責人在台上高喊一，二，三，四，……數，至十位即停止投票。</p>
<p>開票時，先將投票箱當塲示衆，完全像變戲法者，先向觀衆交代淸楚一樣。</p>
<p>當選皇后登（台之時候，台上即鮮花亂飛，鎂光閃爍。</p>
<p>當選皇后中之最把川表情者，首推名媛組亞后謝家驊，謝小姐着大紅喬其紗長袖夜禮服，戴鮮紅紙花二大朶，登合後即以白紗手帕掩面，媚態百出，台下喝采聲不絕於耳。</p>
<p>名媛組皇后王韻梅與社月笙之大小姐及二小姐共坐一桌，言慧珠則與楊虎共坐，開票前楊虎之女小姐對言　珠說：「你當選皇后後，一定要請我吃飯。」</p>
<p>歌星組韓淸菁與張伊雯形影不離，張伊雯於開票前即表示皇后必屬韓淸菁，自己毫無希望，此次參與競選，僅爲救濟難民耳。</p>
<p>經來賓熱烈要求後，張伊雯當塲演唱「薔薇薔薇處處開」，韓清菁則唱「羅曼娜」，並當塲發表救濟難民宏論，采聲與掌聲雷動。</p>
<p>昨日塲中最出風頭者，除「皇后」以外，首推攝影記者，幾乎整觸舞台，被攝影記者所佔據。</p>
<p>會場中昨有不少扒手，乘機活躍，專竊女客皮包，經軍警當塲逮捕者，大有人在。此　　賊衣冠楚楚，且均購票人塲。聞有不少贓物，現存警察總局南部四樓偵緝課內，希失者今日前往認領。</p>
<h3>會場一插曲　報告員陳鶴　當場被檢舉</h3>
<p>曾任敵僞「大東亞反英美協會理事」及提倡「大東亞進行曲」最熱烈之陳逆鶴，昨竟担任大會報吿員，並自動高歌「熱血」，經來賓及記者羣當塲檢舉，未及終塲即遭驅逐。聞已有蒙難同志數人，聯名正式向有關當局檢舉。</p>
<h3>恒通路大火　損失數億　燒死一學徒</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕閘北恒通路九十五號某兄腐鋪，昨晨一時二十五分許，因馬達走火，突遭回祿，延燒左右隣居九十三號，九十七號，又九十九號至一〇一號某棧房內，堆有大批棉花布疋等物，一經着火，勢成燎原。雖經閘北中央消防處等均驅車到塲施救，一時不易撲滅，直至黎明五時始熄。當火熾時，該豆腐店學徒吳山會（十六歲），遍體被火灼傷，直至下午，始經人舁送公濟髒院求治，因爲時已久，火毒攻心，未幾卒吿斃命。是役損失佔計約逾數萬萬元，火首已被警局拘去究辦。</p>
<h3>破獲販賣軍火機關　俄日韓籍三要犯先后就擒　警備部偵查三晝夜煞費苦心</h3>
<p>淞滬備司令部稽査處，於八月十六日接獲密報，有國際性販賣軍火機關，在滬市秘密設立，大肆活動等情，陶處長秉承宣司令對上海治安旣定之決策，即飭交稽査組組長馮仲達副組長盛昌富指示第二組組長王頑石，負全責辦理，限期破案。當日上午十一時許，王組長偕凌霄化裝佯充買軍火者，另派張尙卿劉光麒唐明波三人擔任暗中聯絡後援，分派定當後，根據綫索，前往至一密室，黑暗異常，密不通風，靜候許久，方見一日人名壽義夫者入室，與眼綫（即原報吿人）談稱：外面風聲甚緊，俟深夜方可搬運軍火，語畢離去。六時後，壽復來，謂藏彈人他往，旋復離去，直至深夜十一時，壽復來，引導王組長等至楊樹浦吳興坊三十八號，當由俄人古進Koosin出見，允售</p>
<p>卡賓子彈</p>
<p>二千餘發，明日上午十時交貨。於是王組長等先行返組，翌日（十七）上午十時，準時出發，駕汽車兩輛，王組長偕張尙卿廉榮高及日人壽義夫坐前車引導，後車派徐大欽周家歧嚴綱等暗中隨行，若則若離，以防發生意外，車抵俄人古進家，古進適自外歸來，囑須謹愼行事，免遭失風，並云貨款須四十萬元，王等一一答允，以堅其信，當由古進雇人力車前往某處</p>
<p>提取軍火</p>
<p>王等則派員暗中尾隨，古進至楡林路光裕里八十五號取彈二匣，計藏彈二千一百二十四發，彈夾二只，其時雖人證俱在但王組長滿欲利用此種交易之效果，探求其他販賣機關，是故當時未加逮捕，當即驅車返回，斯時在該路附近四週發現滿佈俄籍之人，顯見其佈置亦甚週密也。一面暗中派員監視幫同販賣軍火犯壽義夫，一面繼續偵査販賣軍火機關。十八日王組長派李醉史維璞周振明三人爲一小組，仍邀同壽分乘汽車兩輛，復往匯山路吳興坊三十八號</p>
<p>俄人古進</p>

<h3>籌募敎育基金舉辦國貨市場　定期義賣五天　貸金目標至少十五億</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市敎育貸金委員會爲救濟本學期淸寒學生，特與國貨運動委員會合辦「國貨市塲」，籌募敎育貸金，昨日下午五時，該會假國際飯店十四樓招待本市工商敎育界，到市參議會議長潘公展，市敎育局副局長李　謀，大夏大學校長王祉偉，家庭工業社胡伯翔，國貨運動委員會田和卿，曁工商各界各學校校長各報記者等百餘人。首由主席李　謀氏致詞：略稱敎育貸金舉辦以來，現已爲第三次，而此次之需要尤爲迫切，數額尤爲鉅大。本學期因物價關係，各私立學校均增加學費甚巨，小學　爲八萬至十二萬，初中十二萬至十六萬，高中十六萬至二十萬，大學二十萬至二十萬。在此種情况下，淸寒學生當然大受影響。敎育局之立塲，雙方都要顧到，一方面須使私立學校在經濟上能够維持，一方面儘量使不影響到淸寒學生的求學機會，所以有兩點希望學校當局：（一）收費最好分兩次收，（二）每校至少有百分之二十的免費學額。截止現在向貸金委員會申請貸金的已有一萬多人，市銀行雖然也在辦貸學金，但成效如何尙不敢說。此外有若干學校如震且大學等，他們自己也在舉辦助學，不過這學期需要的貸金數目較上學期要超出十倍以上，因此現在舉辦「國貨市塲」來籌備，詳細情形請貸金委員會主任陳汝惠報吿。</p>
<p>陳氏起立稱：目前已登記之申請貸金學生已達一萬餘人，以每人十五萬元計，共需十五萬萬元。現採取重點主義，集中力量，聯合上海所有助學團體舉辦「國貨市塲」塲址設於八仙橋中法中學，會期五天，自九月一日開幕，至五日結束。希望至少有百家以上廠商贊助，捐贈義賣品及以最低批發價售與敎育貸金會，在市塲中以市價出售，所得利潤即作爲貸學基金。並稱貸金委員會擬發出代價券三十萬萬，通過各校校長請全市學生推銷，希望至少可達到十萬萬之目標云。</p>
<h3>潘議長慷慨陳詞　籌募貨金不容氣餒　更望大家激發天良</h3>
<p>主席繼請潘公展氏致詞，潘氏以激昂之言辭，獲得全塲數次熱烈鼓掌。略稱上學期錢市長發起之助學金運動亦在國際飯店開會，現在繼續努力，當然大家願意盡力。從一方面看，現在市面較半年前更壞，募款似乎很不容易。但時至今日，不獨敎育界要有遠大目光，工商界亦何獨不然。如果我們這一代的人不想種種法子使下一代的人得到受敎育的機會，如果我們熟視無睹，目光近視，那末國家前途眞是太危險了。我們年齡在四十左右的人，在今日的艱難困苦中，應該當仁不讓，責無旁貸的使靑年們進入校門，剛才聽到兩位光生說，現在的助學運動都由靑年學生自己在做，這實在是我們的悲哀，我們的祖先祇怕子弟不進學校，現在的靑年却須自己奔走求入學的機會，這真是我們的慚愧，所以我們要咬緊牙關，盡量做去。我們絕對不可先就氣餒，先打退步。十五萬萬的目標，我們却要做卅萬萬的運動，。看起來似乎很不容易，實際上祇要動員所有的幾關所有的家庭和所有的成年人，三百萬萬也不算多。試問，昨天匯率變動以後，那些到市場上搶購東西的是些什麼人？他們有的是錢，爲什么不肯拿出來，爲什么米價也漲了？金價也漲了？可以說此班人全無良心，全無骨氣。如果全上海人人都如此，中國永遠沒有希望了。我們要動員全上海的正氣來克服邪氣，來激發他們的天良，所以這一個運動不單是貸學運動，也可以説是光明運動。我們現在徴募的辦法是辦「國貨市場」，事實上國貨工商業亦已經到了埀危的地步，可以說是「同病相憐」，大家都是「窮鬼」，我們自要叫那些失去了良心的人捐出來，相信自要五人十人最多不到一百人就可全部解決了。如果全上海三百四十萬都是窮人，祇有五萬是富人，吿訴他們那是富不了長久的。我們的軍警不是專門保護他們的，我們的三民主義也不是專門保護那些暴發戶的。我們要動員所有的敎育界，所有的正人君子，要那些在昨天收購洋貨的，那些到中央銀行買外匯的，那些到朱葆三路收購美貨的人拿出錢來。相信我們祇要誠心做去，一定能够成功，否則如果預先存了退步，就水遠是弱者懦夫和不中用的鄕愿。</p>
<p>潘氏詞畢，由胡伯翔田和卿王　偉相繼致詞，闡述此次舉辦「國貨市塲」徵募貸學金之意義，至六時半始散會。</p>

<p>美鈔市況和緩·　·較前微升十元</p>
<p>外幣隨金市回落，然因所受壓力屬於間接者，所挫有限，美鈔自晨開一三八〇元光景，盤旋而下，高價未能越過三四〇〇元大關，低價亦未能打破三三〇〇元，形勢緩和，賣買差價亦大加軋攏，終以美匯仍掛三三五〇元，此價頗多購貯備用者，近午一度回升至三四〇〇元以上，午刻在三三九〇元左右，午後爲狀平穩，在三四〇〇元左右掙扎，外灘行家頻加吸收，結果較前收微升十元，對黃金差價再度軋攏至六四五元以內對十兩，港票頗爲恍惚，結果回小二十元，英匯一一五〇〇元，印匯八七〇元，港匯七〇〇元，均有售戶，美匯仍在掛牌有所對做。</p>

<h3>糧審會決議　米價維持原狀　大批洋米在市塲配出　如不能購得可以檢舉</h3>
<p>昨日米市，新貨早色雖有，而中色尚未收割，陳貨因時間關係，漸漸稀少，故各糧來源不多，粳米仍居挺秀，白元及陰元本爲花色，向無正式市價，依然上漲，昨日糧價審議委員會對本市米量價格仍維持原狀，吉明齋氏並親赴南北市塲視察米市情形，決定拋售巴西洋秈二五〇四〇包，（每包一〇〇磅）及二號西貢一二五五〇包，（每包一，二五石）其零售價格，洋秈規定每石不得超過五萬九千元一石，西貢則四萬八千元，吉氏稱食米上漲，實完全無理，如屬必要，決擬實施普遍配給制，並謂今日拋售之洋秈，足可與白粳相抵，如市民不能購得，可向當局檢舉，至昨日到米，南市塲二一七九石，北市塲三五六九石。</p>

<h3>與外匯無關　台糖仍售七萬元　配售辦法傳將予改善　當局已嚴密查禁黑市</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨據台糖公司負責人宋以信語本報記者稱：此次政府調整外匯率，對台糖公司所配售之食糖，決不發生絲毫影響。台糖公司決按原價（每市担七萬元）配售食糖。又台糖公司近來對台糖運滬問題，已獲得充份把握。以後可望源源運到，儘量低價供應云。</p>
<p>據悉：第十期糖共配出二五，六四〇包，均係配售予糖行等，供應外埠之需要。配價照舊，今日即可出貨。第十一期食糖申請期限，至本週五截止。又此後食　配售辦法，正由社會局與台糖公司商訂改良辦法中。聞爲便利各市民購糖便利起見，下次各南貨號門售平價糖時間，將考慮延長，自上午九時起至下午五時爲止。配售辦法，或將利用各保甲機構，實施計口配售。</p>
<p>又台糖公司昨日由仲凱號及海宇號兩輪，自台灣裝到大批食糖。仲凱號裝到一九〇〇噸，海宇號裝到六五八〇噸，現正起卸中</p>
<p>台糖之配售價，拆售價，零星價，均經社會局與公司規定，並未變更，但市上黑市，有抬到十萬元以上者，聞市政當局極爲憤怒，已傳該業負責人　予申斥，一面並已密派幹員，分頭澈查，如得實據，將予嚴辦。</p>
<h3>紗價回跌交易開展　·棉布實銷不動市況平靜·</h3>
<p>昨日紗市始跌終堅，晨初同行因上日紡建平價掛牌，復聞各大廠仰承市長意旨，頗有廉價供應之舉，是以開盤雙馬現貨突降至一百四十三萬，較昨狂落十八萬之巨，旋以廣帮乘廉搜現，收市時雙馬現貨做高至一百五十萬，然申新紗廠開售之雙馬棧單，實僅一百三十五萬也，其餘各支咸較前日降落十萬左右，交易開展，同行及客帮俱有吸胃，是以人心頗爲挺秀，又訊大通紗廠以一百十五萬供售大飛艇，永安紗廠以一百二十六萬供售特金城，安達大中申三統益等廠，亦有相當配售，所惜供售額甚少。</p>
<p>布市上午續見下挫，因實銷不動，且黃金大落，於是浮多更現不安之象，同時鑒於上日紡建公司開售棉紗價盤未曾提高，預料布價當然不能增漲，所以人心不過爾爾，四君子嗶嘰跌風較熾，陰丹士林布受顏料牽制，做開殊鮮，中午紡建照例開售，細布有彩球五福兩種，均照星期末之價，同業方面認爲頗廉，爭相購買，午後市面尚稱平靜。</p>
<h3>胡然而漲·胡然而跌　股市人心忐忑不定</h3>
<p>華股業中新恐慌又起，一部份從事金市者頗有損失，上塲突有斬多，永紗上塲即喊七〇〇元賣出，下跌至六七〇元，始有對手，美亞亦不能例外，頗有帶小，較冷各中小型股，市況清淡，無人詢問，初時極爲沉悶，究以熱股每況愈下，最後亦有削價脫售者，頗有回小，各熱門股初開時一度由低見秀，惟漲勢不久，即復告定，大戶無意於此，紛謀結束，塲內賣戶佔優，不久即復再低，近午再退至低價，而後略回，情況日非，結果較前收下跌頗多，計永紗跌落一成強，美亞景福新光各降一成半強，勤興跌落二成以上，較冷各中小型股，亦回跌一成至二成不等，元老股亦回小半成左右。</p>
<p>外股隨金鈔影響，均告回瀉，怡紗開出即降落至一〇〇〇〇元，始有成交，英聯亦降爲一〇四〇〇元，其他各股亦均被帶小，多頭一致湧出，形成供過於求，隔夜浮多自相踐踏，各股跌勢慘厲，但西商逢低加以吸收，惟爲數不多，無甚爲力，結果較前收計怡紗，英聯會德豐，亞洲，紙業，怡啤，鋼業，各跌一成半至二成不等，業廣則跌一成強。</p>
<p>液體燃料</p>
<p>汽油三公司均定每介侖爲七百四十元，火油前日喊價每聽五介侖一萬五千元，及至下午見三公司並無漲價象徵；致回跌至一萬一千元，昨日上午，買氣較濃，美孚亞細亞每聽價爲一萬三千元，但因供給無限，外商不爲所動，市價難以站定，瞬見下跌，柴油每噸散裝價由二十三萬升至三十三萬，亦有售三十六萬元者，惟均無成交，賣買雙方端視外商三公司之動靜爲轉移。</p>
<p>化工原料</p>
<p>前日上午行盤開價參差不一，燒碱晨喊價　桶六十萬元，至午回至五十萬元，四時市塲亦無正式開價，各物咸依照匯率加五成至六成，但無成交，昨晨行盤大都又復回至週六市價，惟鹽腦（氯化铔）反見跌廿萬元一噸，燒碱亦有喊價每桶五十二萬，但亦有叫四十五萬者，惟工業原料，貨浮於市，難望起色。</p>
<h3>倫敦中國債券　貶值後轉俏利</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十九日電〕今日倫敦外國公債市塲甚爲平靜，中國債券有人買進，蓋以爲中國法幣之貶值，可能成爲一安定之因素。</p>
<h3>白桐油　外銷有望　人心頗爲振奮</h3>
<p>白桐油自外銷停頓，已將兩月，無從發展，僅靠內銷，有時令關係，現在夏銷將次落令，故市塲上沉寂已極，日前外滙變更，出口貨可以獲得不少助力，因此市塲人心極度振奮，但對外交易尚未做開，故價格亦無從評定，惟各家內銷油現售十萬零五千元至十一萬之間，因銷極細微，袛算點綴市面而已。</p>
<p>洪江桐油雖僅供內銷，然以原料關係，成本當然亦連帶提高，惟現値夏銷落令之際，售價能否加起，殊少把握。</p>

<h3>一部份美進口貨　仍歸政府機構代辦</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿日電〕　美國之一般國外貿易大部分業已歸商業界自營，但商務部認爲大批購買中，仍有一部分將賡續由政府代理人方面經理，除遠東橡膠及古巴食糖之大批收購外，該部復縷述其他政府之收購計劃，就中包括智利赤銅，波里維亞錫鉛蔗糖酒精繩索纖維鋼玉木料及金鷄納樹皮等云。</p>

<h3>糖商觀望</h3>
<p>糖市因前日外匯波動上漲後，昨已回平，中砂破十五萬關，降萬餘元，其他亦隨鬆，但多數尚持觀望態度，故成交不多，僅與化帮開出貢粉白十六萬元，小七八千元，興赤十四萬元，成交八十餘簍，汕帮提　叫升五千元，棉赤叫十四萬五千元，均未成交。</p>

<h3>湘省救災的重心</h3>
<p>— 本報十一日長沙航訊　特派員高元禮</p>
<p>湘南是一個嚴重的災區，受災的成份最重，受災的面積也最廣，災害的種類亦最多。百多萬人民餓死，數百萬人民流徒；現在呻吟在飢餓死亡綫上的，還有千餘萬人。樓實堅忍爽直的湖南人民，他們都是忠實者，他們從不顧多訴苦，多叫屈，我們對這羣不善講話，不願講話的苦難中的人民，應該寄予更多的同情與援助。</p>
<p>戰災冠各省</p>
<p>廿七年的空前大火，燒得數十萬湘民流離失所，全湘的精華付之一炬，先後經過四次長沙會戰，二次湘南會戰，二次湘西會戰，一次衡陽大會戰。廿七年臨湘岳陽失陷，敵騎進擾，敵我兩軍隔河對峙，壓進屢退。湘北一帶，已成廢墟。治常桃會戰，洞庭糧倉，破壞無遺。廠窖之役，殺人盈野。卅三年夏，敵陷長沙，進團衡陽，旋沿湘桂綫深入，桂柳旣陷，敵轉鋒東向，由湘桂綫越粵漢，因以人粵境，卅萬人淫掠殺燒之慘，爲空前所未有。其後在桂潰退入湘境，焚掠尤甚。八載以還，湖南受災最深，災區尤廣，達五十四縣市，其戰災損失程度，爲全國各省之冠。</p>
<p>天災頻頻來</p>
<p>民國卅四年全省七十六縣，遍遭旱災，安鄕，灃縣，常德，沅江等縣，遭水災，桃源安化等縣，遭受蟲災，及各縣普遍流行之病疫，如惡性瘧疾，霍亂，傷寒，腦膜炎，天花等，疾病相乘，死亡相繼，農村破產，民不聊生，險象環生，不堪書述，以上種種都爲外界所深知的災難，此外陸續的災難都爲外界所忽略，他們不死，我們不管，然而災難與湖南早已結了不解之緣。抗戰期內，無一時無災，無一縣無災，或許是「債多了不還」，「　多了不咬」吧，人民習見，政府習聞，多以不了了之。然而不論怎樣，樸實堅忍的人民，他們忍受苦難，也有一定的限度，越過了這個限度，簡單一句話，就是死的總匯，也就是一切的毁滅，我們能看着湖南如此沉淪下去嗎？</p>
<p>我們從善救總署湖南分署可以看到許多關於各地的災情，以及他們的救濟工作，下面就是湖南災情與救濟的寫實。</p>
<p>悽厲的災情</p>
<p>受災地區五十二縣及長沙衡陽兩市，面樻五十萬方里，佔全省面積百分之七十，陷區人民達二千一百餘萬人，佔全省人口百分之七十五以上。（一）人口死亡五十七萬七千五百廿七人，（二）全省傷病人數一百六十七萬六千二百一十二人，（四）房屋損失九十四萬五千餘楝，估値二萬二千九百零五億元。（五）糧食損失四千零六十八萬石，佔値二千一百四十八億元。（六）耕牛損失六十四萬頭，估値五百億元。（七）器具衣服損失，估値四萬二千六百億元。（八）其他各種損失，四萬六千一百五十億元。（以上各數均在卅四年度估計，如以現値計，則不止此數。）</p>
<p>救濟的工作</p>
<p>（一）遣送難民，長沙，衡陽，邵陽，岳陽，零陵，沅陵，常德，安江，郴縣等九個難民服務處，自卅四年十一月至卅五年七月底止，共計遣送難民廿四萬九千人。（二）配發寇災急振，長沙，衡陽，岳陽等五十二市縣，至本年七月底止共發振款五千七百萬元。（三）製發寒衣棉被，湘分署成立之初，時届冬令，氣候酷寒，惟災民無衣無被，待振孔段，曾先後共製棉衣三萬六千餘件，分配五十四縣市，合四千餘萬元。又發長·衡·邵·之難民服務處一千萬元專製棉大衣，配發過境難民。另外又在安江第一舫紗廠，趕製棉被一千六百床，發交各難民處備用。（四）施粥廠及施粉廠，三十五年一月九日起，先後開始施粥者有長沙四廠，衛陽六廠，零陵·湘陰·岳陽各二廠，街山·東安·祁陽·臨湘·各一廠，共計收容災民一萬一千人，成績卓著，明國人士，贊許不巳。至本年五月底止，各種施粥廠改爲施粉廠，除原有各廠外，尙添常寗，衡陽等七廠，共計收容災民五萬，配發粉一千餘噸，副食費一千二百萬元。（五）急振工作隊，五月份共派出工作隊二十二隊，在長沙等災情較重二十二縣市發放麵粉，救濟災民九萬，共發粉二百九十八萬斤，以上爲第一期。自六七兩月，又分後出發工作隊一百五十三隊之多，救濟災民共計二百零二萬人，共發豆粉麵粉三千萬斤，前後共發三千三百萬斤。（六）火災急振，計發臨湘。華容·長沙·漢壽等縣。（七）粵米之分配，第一次運到衡陽食米十噸，均直接分發各縣配發災民，第二次十噸，第三次六十七噸。</p>
<p>農貸與工貸</p>
<p>（八）農賑。一，耕牛貸款共發一億四千萬元粉一百噸，二，緊急農貸，第一期一億四千萬元，第二期七千萬元，第三期十億八千八百萬元，小型農田水利貸款二千五百萬元，塘壩貸歡五億元。（九）發放種籽及肥料貸金，四十四縣市共發肥料款一億六千八百萬元，種籽八千六百萬元。（十）工振，正修築者，有零道公路，零東路，邵新路，測量中者，有衡常路。五六兩月，在工振方面共發麵粉六百二十四萬斤，救濟災民四十一萬人。（十一）平民住宅及小學校舍，平民住宅共發四億三千二百萬元，小學校舍一億三千三百萬元。（十二）善救工廠，目前已能生產者，共計四廠，經營縫紉，紡織，刺繡，捲烟，印花，針織等業務。（十三）修築堤垸，及塘壩補助各縣修築堤垸費一千四百萬元，撥發麵粉二千三百噸，在塘壩方面已發粉三百六十噸，貸款五億元。（十四）工礦貸款及小工業貸款，工鑛貸款以棉紡業爲最多，小工業貸款已達五千萬元。（十五）補助各醫院修建經費，計發十五個單位，一億八千萬元，其他救濟事業尙多，未能一一列舉。</p>
<p>重心在工賑</p>
<p>由以上的數字，可以看出湖南救濟的經過情形，雖然曾作如此的努力，但災情還是相當的重。分署主持的急振工作，配合着秋收，即將吿一段落。今後的重心，將趨重於工振方面，來做初步的善後工作，要以國際的力量，來復興湘省的工礦，交通，農田水利等工作，則破碎的農村，才會有復甦繁榮的希望，整個計劃，分署已在擬訂，即可發表。</p>

<h3>訪吳貽芳女士</h3>
<p>— 本報十四日南京訊　駐京記者張明</p>
<p>已經是該吃晚飯的時候了，驕陽稍稍減威的光彩，橫掃在寂寞的草地上，就在這蒼生的草地上矗立着紅磚宮殿式的屋宇，在訪問這位主角—吳貽芳校長以前，記者首先作了一次孤獨的參觀。</p>
<p>你自然不會相信，綠絨般的草地上已經點綴了不少高起的長草在屋宇後面，還正叢生着成堆的蔓草呢！房子，從外表看來，那是够壯觀的，但是今天，他讓頹敗的色調給塗抹上了，但是在一幢用爲敎員宿舍的屋子裏，我却見着一些盟友的女敎授們正坐着軟墊的櫈子在輕輕的撩着天。他們全是很溫靜，很樸實，宗敎的氣息散佈着。偌大的庭園，就只這一角還充滿着人羣的氣息。</p>
<p>女博士才學兼備</p>
<p>在另一幢屋子裏，記者守候了吳校長，過去，我見過她，然而今天懷着要「認識」她的心理來訪問她，於是我對她有着輪廓綫條的看法。</p>
<p>我知道她五十二歲了，她是杭州人，她是美國密歇根大學碩士和博士，她是個敎育家，—做了十五年的大學校長，她又是個政治家—擔任了八年的參政員。</p>
<p>從辦公室，走進會客室，不算矮的身材，結實的體格，頭髮是梳着結的，架着從不脫離的近視眼，一件淡靑條的布長衫，下面半高跟的黑皮鞋，無論怎麼說，她給人們一眼，就評定了她是一個才學兼備的敎育家。她很忙，一走進來就說：「我讓你久等了，很抱歉。」</p>
<p>「我知道，這是一個很不適當的時間。」記者很不安的說。</p>
<p>「因爲有幾封信必須趕快發出去。」她說。</p>
<p>「是爲招考的事吧？」</p>
<p>「不是，」於是這一個問題使她對八年來學校的變遝全部說了出來。</p>
<p>復員事備感艱辛</p>
<p>她說學校的復員是不容易的，就憑修理來說吧，前些日子，一個宿舍的修理費就化了七百萬，才勉强可以住，一共有四個宿舍，還有這麽多的校舍也全沒整頓，但是她說最重要的，是從敎學上必備的桌椅備起，因爲課桌已經被人盜跑了，沒有課桌是第）個不能上課的條件，圖書也散失了，在日本投降後，我們受降以前，這一段混亂的過渡時期裏，曾經被人盜去不少，幸而現在還收回了大部，這是不幸中之大幸，說鋼琴吧，戰前有二十餘架，等到接收時，已經只　下兩架了，現在費盡心血到上海去買了兩架，就化了三百多萬元，但是吳校長是決心要在敎學上求得一切便利的，鋼琴是音樂系必備的敎具。</p>
<p>她回憶似的吿訴我，這些屋子的建築精美，完全是創辦人對於美國敎育的觀點，認爲讀書必須要有好的環境，和舒適的住處，同時作一種長久的計劃，也因此這幢房子雖然經過了八年日本人的佔用，除去被破壞而外，還不致有其他的損壞和破壞，接着她仍然不斷的對記者說明她在敎育上的意見。</p>
<p>談學歷成績超羣</p>
<p>當記者向她探詢關於她的求學生活時，她總很謙虛的不說什麼。她說：我沒有一篇傳記，別人也無法爲我寫一篇傳記，因爲如現在就寫，未免太早，許多經歷，她都闢開不談。不得已，記者只得慢慢的和她撩家常似的，撩起天來。</p>
<p>她說，她雖是杭州人，但是她的父親是江蘇泰縣人，她生長在武昌，又到杭州進學校，所以她的幼年是顚簸在生活的旅程上的，她在國內進的兩個學校很奇妙的，都是草創的學校：一個是杭州地方上所謂維新的紳土辦的，即杭州公立女學校。進這個學校時，她已經十一歲了，雖然是小學程度，但凡進這所學校，都是拘有認眞求學的態度，所以在校內的硏究學問的空氣是好極了。這所學校創辦的主旨，也在提倡女子工作，不希望女子做爲玩物在當時，這種新思潮是很受人崇敬的，吳校長也就在這種精神下讀了三年書，後來，她進中學，可進得多了，比如蘇州景海，杭州宏道，她都是高材生，然而都沒有拿了他們的畢業文憑，最後，她進大學，也就是她現在主持的學校金陵女大，她進去時，已是該校創辦伊始，這時進金女大的學生，大部份是在社會上工作過一個時期的，她也爲了父母相繼去世，她讀了中學後，不得不到社會上去服務，因爲她不僅沒有人負擔她的學費，還有一個妹妹需要敎育·這個時期，她工作了兩年，但是好學不倦的她，始終覺得學歲不足之苦，於是又投考到金陵女大去讀書，後又由敎會把她保送到美國密歇根大學去讀書，她始終是勤學，苦學，成績超人，她的所以學有成就，敎會是一個偉大的力量·而她本身也有誨人不倦的精神，所以她主持金陵女大，是一個最適當的工作，也可以說是最適宜的事業，是的，在她的策劃中，金陵女大的前途是未可限量的。</p>
<p>重實踐不忘政治</p>
<p>她的參加政治關係，還是從抗戰次年國民參政會開始，但是她有組織和領導的能力和機會却不是那時候起，民國廿二年全世界婦女代表大會，在芝加哥召開，我國外交部就選大學敎授晏陽初等前往，吳校長也在那時出席，民國廿四年，又被選爲中華基督敎全國協進會的執委會主席，在這以前，她在民國十八年，廿年，廿二年，三次出席太平洋學會，雖然這是私人的學會，可是吳校長的成就是不小的。然而在這許多次的機會裏，她都是在敎會和敎育上努力，的。去年才是正式的政府派赴出席舊金山會議的一員，她在美國又獲得了無限的榮譽MieeS大學曾經給出席大會的五位女代表以名醫學位，常時校給學位的典禮上，吳校長就被推崇爲最有聲望的一晨，所以在照片上，效是居中而站的，當她出席參政會担任主席團時，她是這樣的持重，這麽有條不紊，當時，一些不熟悉敎育界的人士還以爲她的一鳴驚人是其他一些簡單的原因，或者說，因爲她是個女的。其實，她的成就是水到渠成的，何况她在某些一地方獲得成就後，仍然念念不忘她百年樹人的大計·她孜孜不倦的，埋首在金陵女大的校長辦公室裏，不斷的爲學校前途設計，做學子們的表率。</p>
<p>余陵女大校長吳貽芳博士</p>
<h3>揚州半月</h3>
<p>— 本報十六是揚州訊特約記者王公瀚</p>
<p>整個蘇北的局勢，不久以前，由於國軍在各綫方面予共軍以反擊以後，屢獲開展，人們一時皆大爲興奮。可是，最近兩天，雖然報紙上的消息，依舊沉寂，但難胞們在心底裏似已獲得了一新的慰藉。他們堅信着：他們是總會有回到自己故鄉的一天的。</p>
<h3>四鄉綏靖商業呈現起色</h3>
<p>其次說到揚州本縣，四鄉的共軍是幾已完全被國軍驅逐出了整個的縣境的，僅有本鄉方面的七區轄境，及北鄉九區的轄境，尙有一部份地盤猶在共軍手中。曾屢遭共眾截斷的「揚泰公路」，確是完全在國軍把握中。「　儀」（揚州至儀徵縣）和「揚天」（揚州至天長縣）兩公路，也已先後爲國軍打通。這一開展，給揚州的影響是很大的，最顯著的當然要算是江都縣的縣政，從此許多工作不會再侷促城廂一隅。他如給商業上的影響，有人這樣估計過：如果不是國軍這麽一來，頂到中秋節人揚州的一些正式商店，起碼要倒閉去三分之一，是準有可能的。像南貨店，雜貨店，五洋店，布店之類，就都比較以前多了生意。鄉鎭上的店家逐漸已來城中辦貨。</p>
<h3>秋收豐稔米價突告回降</h3>
<p>本月十號左右，當鄉間田裏的晚稻正在放花結實，也就是最需要雨的時候，老天爺特別幫忙似的，接連賜落了幾塲甘霖。那天，記者在理髪店裏理髪，直聽見理髮師和理髮師在有一句沒一句的談：「這塲雨，簡直是黃金」！「今年的早稻晚稻收成都是十足了」！「西北鄕恐怕十足還要…」之後，那一天的第二天，記者便聽說米價有了回跌。大前天，（十一日）最上好的白米由五萬幾，一下子便跌落到三萬幾，糙一點的竟跌到了二萬幾。到昨天，據調査：普通中等的新米，祇三萬一二千元。</p>
<h3>人造水災威脅尚未解除</h3>
<p>這樣人們禁不住都在開心了！但是，人們在這些開心的事之外，時刻却要在担心着另一件大事，那不是戰爭，也不是飢饉，而是人造的水災！</p>
<p>自從共軍掘決洪澤湖堤，早已爲這裏的人們注意了，比注意任何國家大事以及任何世界大事，還要來得注意。因爲：民國二十年悽慘絕倫的大水災，凡是三十歲以上的人都曾遭受過的，尤其是那悲慘的印象，至今猶深刻在人們的腦際。大水淹起來，揚州城大致尙無妨，可是裏下河之泰州，興化，東台，高郵，鹽城……等若干縣份，則均將成爲一片澤國。而這個大災禍可免與不可免的關鍵，是操在共軍手裏。由揚州沿運河而上，約計有十三個壩口，其中以邵伯過去之「昭關壩」最最緊要·據傳說：共軍已在「昭關壩」的底子挖空，此後，並有掘決洪澤湖堤威脅。記者不信這個傳說是眞實的，但也沒法證明事實究竟是怎樣。不過即使這傳說是個謠言，也可以想見，人們對事情的關注與恐懼是已到達如何的程度！</p>
<h3>大水慘劇重演成份較多</h3>
<p>爲了這件事，記者今天特走訪「蘇北運河二程局」並順便走出「福運門」看着·那知滾滾的大水，就在近兩天，江潮來的時候，已經登陸了。這和記者記憶中之二十年大水災時期「福運門」及「鈔關」一帶有水上岸的情形，相差已無幾。看上去，民二十年悽慘的大水災，是重演的成份多，可免的成份少了·因爲第一，秋汎已至，第二搶修運河的工作已失却防範未然的積極性·何况：據十三日「江都日報」載：搶修運河的材料，蘇北運河工賑局，訂於昨日至十九日方在鎭江招標呢。又「該局新任局長鄭通和，尙未到任，局務須俟該局長到任後再行展開。」第三，前面已經說過了，運河的重要壩口，是在共軍的控制中的，加培運河堤，修築運河堤，是一回事，倘共軍一且不顧一切喪心病在地將運河堤重要的處所掘決兩個口子，是另一回事呵！</p>
<p>因此。對於這件事，九個流亡的縣府機關，就更關心着。準備隨國軍的推進而各自進入各自的縣境，他們幾乎是天天都在準備着。</p>
<h3>津門八一五盛事</h3>
<p>— 十六日天津訊　特約記者李紹林</p>
<p>「八一五」早晨天津市大街小巷都懸起了國旗，旗角臨風招展，似乎在拂盪着母個人的心弦。去年今日，日本投降的消息傳遍寰宇，帶給以人在歡和一個光明的前景。大家從黑洞洞的防空室鑽出來又跑到太陽光下過份的明亮，簡直使人有些眼花撩亂，怔怔的讓心房在跳，思想給狂歡凝結住，忘記了剛才停止的慘劇，也沒有想到明天還有陰雲會掩遮陽光，從初冬到嚴冬。</p>
<p>一刹那的在歡過去後，大家的熱情隨着氣溫往下降，直降到寒暑表所顯示的零下若干度·雖然經過今春的春風吹拂，今夏的炎日烘烤，但冰凍的人心暖不起來了，看看今年「八一五」天津市上熙攘往來的行人面孔，那裏再能發現去年此日的欣悅？街頭的國旗正臨風招展·旗角似乎在拂盪着每個人的心弦·</p>
<h3>獻旗國軍衛國干城</h3>
<p>雖然如此，這畢竟是個値得紀念的日子。天津市各界在這一天舉行了慰勞盟軍國軍大會。大會的節目，從淸晨進行到深夜，大家眉宇間，談吐中，固然沒有了神經質的狂歡，但此時此地，冷靜的回憶，更富有紀念的意義。對慰勞國軍方面，重要的節目是獻旗獻花·上午十點鐘，天津市黨部書記長韓達領導着青年團員在此間九十四軍軍部天禮堂裏，舉行獻旗儀式。牟廷芳軍長把題着「衛國千城」的錦旗接受後，他說：「去年今日全國歡欣鼓舞，今年今日則建國障碍重重，人民飽受痛苦，希望明年今日能走上建國大道。」沉重的語氣，話像一字一字的從嘴裏跳出來。</p>
<h3>金石之盟中美合作</h3>
<p>慰勞盟軍的晚餐會下午八時舉行。駐華美海軍陸戰隊司令駱基中將和他的僚屬均應邀參加·晚會開始後，張廷諤市長首先代表全津市民把錦旗和簽名紀念册贈奉駱基中將。張市長在致詞裏，說出了多少人要說的話：「現在勝利已達一年，但是勝利的果實並未佈滿中國，不僅國軍未得安息，盟軍也爲了友誼性的任務，不能與久別的家族聚首，這使我們除感謝之外，更引爲遺憾·不過，我們相信中國和世界都是從黑暗走向光明的。」駱基中將在答詞裏這樣說：「去年的這一天是經過戰鬥和流血而獲得的，我們不能忘記爲戰鬥而犧牲的人民·在這一年間，大家共同奮鬥以求眞正和平比戰爭更爲困難，希望不要灰心，共同造成永久的和平！」</p>
<p>駐津的美國海軍陸戰隊第一加强師，爲紀念勝利週年紀念日，在上午九時舉行閱兵。參加檢閱的，共有陸戰隊八隊，七百餘人。我們的民衆把天津民園操塲四週看台完全佈滿了。檢閱開始的時候，美陸戰隊第一加强師樂隊，首先奏起美國國歌，接着又是中國國歌·看台上的民衆，看見塲內的人一致肅立，也都跟着站起來了。駱基中將繞視部隊行閱兵式完畢後，隨之分列式開始。上空廿四架海盜式的飛機在盤旋，機身從雲際響徹地面。八隊陸戰隊自檢閱官面前嚴肅的走過去，然後回歸他們的營房。</p>
<h3>娛樂塲所免費勞軍</h3>
<p>天津第四家舞塲，五家電影院和戲院，從下午起到深夜止，都開放着，分別免費慰勞盟軍和國軍。電影院和戲院到的人不多，結果是讓市民塡了空，舞塲的情形，比較熱鬧，籌備勞軍大會的特請了幾位白俄舞女表現舞蹈。在天津比較整齊的永安舞塲，是專爲慰勞盟軍軍官的。在十一點，有三位白俄女陸續的走進舞池，光着大腿，扭動着腰肢，表演她們的舞蹈，一節表演完畢後，跟着一陣掌聲。屋角裏孤軍的坐着一位美國軍官，招待員問他是否要一位舞伴，他說他需要靜坐與沈思，他沉思些甚麽呢？「八一五」的夜裏，落着大雨，秋意是深了。</p>

<h3>羅斯福總統對蘇妥協已引起嚴重的後果蘇向近東地中海伸張勢力</h3>
<p>— 佐溪節譯自The　SaturdayEceningPos</p>
<p>今春在巴黎舉行的四國外長會議，有人說是一種專門會議，主要的目的在完成歡洲的五個德國附庸國家的和約。但參加這次會議的人們都很明白：這不僅是一種專門會議，而是試騐羅斯福總統的「遠大計劃」是否全部失敗或者局部成功的塲所，正如二十七年以前巴黎變成了威爾遜總統的世界革新計劃的試騐塲所一樣。</p>
<p>羅斯福早在一九四三年便定了蘇聯握着世界和平的樞紐，因此他手訂了一個確立蘇聯與西方列强間友好關係的「遠大計劃」，準備把美國的未來作孤注之一擲。羅斯福爲了取得蘇聯當局的信賴，不惜背離了大西洋憲章的精神，和蘇聯締結密約，把歐洲和亞洲的富饒地區送給了蘇聯。</p>
<p>由於戰爭期間有保守軍事秘密的必要，我們無從知道美國對蘇聯的讓步究竟是些什麽。美國政府至今猶未發表自一九四一年以來美蘇關係的詳細報吿，但是我們已經獲得充分可靠的情報。這是羅斯福親自簽署的報吿，題爲「德黑爾會議之經過實况。「羅氏在該報吿中說明他在一九四三年十一月出席德黑蘭會議時携有戰後世界理想計劃一件，其最大關鍵便是如何取得蘇聯的誠意合作，以謀戰後問題之解決。羅斯福爲了賺得史達林的信任，早已準備作任何必要的讓步。當時史達林表示願意和蘇聯的友邦赤誠合作，並聲明他絕無囊括歐洲的慾望。於是羅斯福對於史達林的善意便深信而不疑。</p>
<p>可是德黑蘭會議中代表三强之一的邱吉爾却並不附和羅斯福的見解，而認爲根據廣泛的原則有取得蘇聯諒解之可能。因此英蘇間曾發生嚴重的衝突，而羅斯福便從中斡旋，企圖消除異見，以貫澈其拉攏蘇聯加入國際集團的計劃。</p>
<p>但是在德黑蘭會議閉慕以後，蘇聯曾屢次單獨行動，事前並朱和盟邦有所協商。這時羅斯福猶未放棄其對蘇協調的努力。但是在雅爾達會議結束到羅斯福病故的幾個月中，美蘇關係進入了極黯淡的階段。此時羅斯福對於蘇聯的誠意開始發生了懷疑。正當他準備重行考慮對蘇政策時，他突然死去了。當杜魯門繼羅斯福出任美國總統時，對德對日戰爭仍在進行中；他同時接受了羅斯福的對蘇友好合作政策。杜魯門處於當時情形，自未便改變此項政策。</p>
<p>在一九四五年四月杜魯門就任美國總統到同年八月聯合國在波茨坦舉行會議的一段時間裏，蘇聯的能態度漸漸倔强起來，軍隊的調動往往一意孤行，甚至和被解放國家成立協定的事情，也不通知聯合國。當波茨坦會議時，杜魯門總統爲了避免改變其前任的對蘇政策，對蘇聯給予更大的讓步。在這次會議中西方列强不顧大西洋憲章中的土地規定，批准了德國東部之割裂；也是在這次會議中，英美政府不顧美國的少數民族權之傳統主張，贊成了蘇聯的移民政策。羅斯福已經在原則上讓步於前，杜魯門總統便不得不認可於後·波茨坦會議的結果雖然秘不宣佈，但杜魯門總統從這次會議回來以後，對於蘇聯的意向較前更多懷疑，從此以後，杜魯門決計不再親自出席這種三強會議，而將美蘇關係的處理交託給外交政策專家去辦理。</p>
<p>在羅斯福逝世以前，史達林的國家主養計劃較前更加明朗化了。蘇聯明白表示有意把歐亞兩洲和蘇聯接壤的部分加以割裂，然後再以新的形式重行合併，以確保蘇聯在這些地方的經濟及政治優勢。蘇聯又根據該項計劃，使英美同意蘇聯合併立陶宛，拉脫維亞，愛沙尼亞，及芬蘭，波蘭，羅馬尼亞，捷克和德國的一部分。在亞洲方面，史達林要求我們同意蘇聯合併千島羣島，收回庫頁島的南半部，並恢復蘇聯在東北的特殊利益。此外蘇聯在巴爾幹半島，在德國，在朝鮮等地所獲得的利益更不一而足。假如蘇聯得到這許多利益而認爲滿足，那麼西方各國對於他們的這些旣得權利，也就默爾而息·偏偏蘇聯不知滿足，開始向地中海和近東伸張它的勢力。蘇聯要求在土耳其領土上建立一個要塞，以控制達達尼爾海海峽。此後蘇聯又迫使伊朗政府對蘇作重大讓步。</p>
<p>蘇聯這些政治攻勢對於英帝國是最大的威脅。英國自感力量薄弱，不得不希望美國的支援。這時杜魯門總統覺得可以表白他對於蘇聯所稱善意和合作的懷疑了。的確，蘇聯使人懷疑的地方太多了，同時蘇聯對於所謂友好合作精神的貢獻也實在太少了。杜魯門曾在波茨坦承認了羅斯福的全部讓步，並且還添加了幾項他自己提出的讓步。可是在七個月以後，他明白表示他終於否認了促使羅斯福對蘇讓步的基本信念—即所謂蘇聯的「善意」是。</p>
<p>羅斯福在對蘇讓步之外，還連帶的創造了一個聯合國機稱，可是他覺得這個機稱非經過幾年的時間以後是不會發生效力的。在此過渡時期，美國政府不得不實行强權政治，雖然多數美國人會不滿於這種作風。可是只有美國發展它本身的强有力的單獨政策，旣不偏袒英國，也不偏袒蘇聯，世界纔有保持均勢的可能。這一切條件就形成了我們的時代，而巴黎四國外長會議自始至終便是這種强權政治的十足的表現</p>
<p>羅斯福之所以在逝世前兩年中對蘇聯作了極大的讓步，是因爲那時他覺得蘇聯需要和平，願與西方各國合作，作爲獲取和平的代價。但是在羅氏逝世以前，他漸漸覺得蘇聯並無付出代價的誠意和慷慨，除非收賬員緊緊地催促他。巴黎外長會議便是收賬過程中的一個步驟——杜魯門總統就承祖了這件不愉快的工作。他不但呼籲美國人民付淸他們自己的賬單，並且慫慂戰時的盟邦付淸他們的賬單。美國櫻桃努力消除革蘇間深刻化的敵愾心，並設法調和他們的軋　。同樣，美國應使蘇聯知道，除非蘇聯堅持要以共產主義强迫推行到各國去，則美國亦決不願以其資本主義强迫推行到不需要的地方去。蘇聯所願付出代價的，不是他們的旣得權利，而是目前他們所需要的。好在蘇聯目前所最需要的是和平，而美國目前的對蘇政策，就是根據這一個信念：認爲蘇聯爲獲取和平起見，是不惜支付任何代價的，但是事實上蘇聯在這方面所表現的勉强得很，而且他們所付的代價又是那樣零零碎碎的。</p>

<h3>美國從孤立主義到國際合作</h3>
<p>美國在國際政治上所佔地位的重要，是舉世公認的事實。作家康瑪格曾就美國從孤立主義走向世界合作的過程，寫了一篇文章，發表於「美國」第二卷第八號上，要義如下：</p>
<p>美國孤立主義失敗了，大多時間而已。數的美國人，看到了孤立主義的破產之後，就轉變到國際主義來。猶如邱吉爾所說的，在一九一七年和一九一四年，新世界兩度出來拯救和解放了舊世界，美國的人民和政府現在已經準備在組織和維持新世界秩序方面，担當起適當的責任了。</p>
<p>然而國際主義怎樣會佔優勢的呢？究竟什麼力量克服了美國在地理上和歷史上主張孤立主義的理論？這決不是偶然的一回事，而是牽涉到經濟，政治和道德各方面的。</p>
<p>從某種意義上講，美國人以前雖自以爲孤立，實際上是從不孤立的。美國立國以來一向和世界政治有着密切的關係，不過美國政治家和美國人民在認識這一點之前，曾經經過相當長的一段</p>
<p>假如我們要確定指出美國以大國姿態參加世界政治的日期，我們應該說是十九世紀的九十年代。常時歐洲的政治情形變化甚劇，美國更其如此：由於開發工作的積極展開，國境已經直趨太平洋海岸，人口激增至七千五百萬，而工業革命的迅速進行，已經使美國製造商不得向世界尋取市塲，推廣生產品的銷路。此外，運輸交通的日趨便利，也使美國和世界其他部份的關係更見密切·五十年來，美國一直循着這一路徑向外發展，「門羅主義」一類思想，常然是絕對不適用的了。</p>
<p>比這些經濟和社會原因更重要的，就是政治和道德的原因。工業革命和科學發明使地球縮小，太平洋和大西洋天然防禦，已經失却了固有的意義。爲了國家的安全，就得積極參加世界政治，那是非常明顯的。美國必須和友好國家獲得諒解，相互合作，以謀維持世界和平。美國是大西洋社會的一部份，也是太平洋社會的一部份，從道德上講，世界是一個整體，我們不能和世界分隔開來。惟有世界秩序對民主政治有利的條件之下，民主政治才能在美國繁榮。最後，美國人已經發覺美國必須是世界社會的一部份，不僅是爲了經濟或政治的理由，而且也爲了最基本的道德的理由，「四海一家」的觀念，已經克服了「我行我素」的心理。</p>
<h3>瞽者復明美國「眼庫」備有死人眼膜</h3>
<p>自十二歲那年以迄去年十月間，克萊多氏一直瞎了十七年。他的眼病似乎是病入膏盲了。可是在六個月以前，他的左眼施行了一次新穎的手術竟得以重見天日。他說這種手術是「人體所能遭遇的最偉大的奇跡。」</p>
<p>簡短的幾句話概述了「眼庫」的工作目標和成就，四月中，眼庫已成立一年。跟庫的工作已很成功，本週內它將在芝加哥設立分庫，不久將來在波士頓設立另一分庫的計劃亦已振定。</p>
<p>因爲有了眼庫，去年有好幾百個瞎子逢臨到不可能的事，可是還有萬千其他瞎子仍待幫助·憑佔計，在美國二十五萬人瞎子中，施行眼角膜手術後就能重見天日的達十萬人，最大問題在於缺乏眼角膜。</p>
<p>眼角膜是什麽？假如你對鏡自照，你就可以看見眼睛中的白地，就那是眼簾，同時你會看見眼簾中央的黑色瞳子·眼角膜是瞳子和眼簾上面的透明的圓窗，在正常的眼睛裏，眼角膜時常經眼淚和眼皮洗刷·然而有時這個眼角膜的圓窗破裂，汚損或被蔽蓋了；綫祇能隱隱約約地通過它，雖則限的共他部分仍不失正常狀態，人却失明了。</p>
<p>好幾世紀以來，醫師們都想割去已損壞的眼膜並補上明朗的一片，然而這些都是徒然的，沒有成功。他們想利用玻璃，然而人們的眼睛却不能容忍外來的物體。他們曾用移植各種動物眼角膜的方法，這些動物眼角膜自猪而至於鷄都實騐過了，結果還是失敗。終於他們就用到人類自己的眼角膜，幾經失敗後終於完成了移植人的眼角膜的工作。</p>
<p>這種手術是成功的，然而那兒來這麼多人類的眼膜呢？醫生可以從幾方面得到它：常有某些病人眼睛無法保全，而眼睛却毫無毛病。不過這個來源還不够，怎能滿足萬千失明人的殷切需求呢。因此醫師們又向死人方面從事實驗，結果發現死後數小時屍體上的眼角膜仍是活生生的，可以用以恢復盲人的視力。</p>
<p>眼庫的設立就是收集捐贈人的眼睛。眼庫請求任何種族和年齡的死者捐贈其眼睛·道些眼睛送達眼庫經過檢騐後就轉送與擅於移植眼角膜的醫師·爲了眼睛能保持廿二小時還不失新鮮和美國各主要航空公司都願意輸送這些眼睛，眼庫就成爲全國性的機稱。和眼庫維持聯絡的醫院已逾八十所，自然而然地它就成爲美國的硏究眼膜手術和訓練眼科醫師的中心。</p>
<p>失明後重見天日是怎麼一回事呢？有史以來極少數人有這種經騐；移植眼膜手術發見後，這幾年來因而體騐到這回事的人或許比過去整個人類史上曾有這種經騐的人爲多。</p>
<p>克萊多就具有這種體騐，他現年二十九歲，是賓夕法尼亞州的一個農人，本文一開始就提及他·十二歲時他還是一個健全的兒童，一天，他的左眼被小朋友拋擲的雪球擊傷。這樣一來左眼就開始發炎，一如通常的眼病，右眼也受到感染·不管怎麼小心地醫治，發炎一直持續六個月還沒有好。後來痛楚總算是消失了，然而失明已成了事實。雙眼的眼膜都枯焦了，以至於光綫無法通過，他瞎了·</p>
<p>他向來沒有想到一旦他會重見大日。失明後不久，他就聽人談起移植眼角膜的事，然而那時的移植手術是失敗的，此後他忘却了它，直到去年，他才讀到（他並沒有全瞎）一篇論述眼庫的雜誌專文。後來他就要求一位到紐約去的藥劑師順便替他打聽一下關於眼庫的消息。不久以後他就親自到紐的去領受檢査，並辦理手術登記手續，眼庫的人並吿訴他隨時準備，以期於得到一片適用的眼角膜時施行手術。</p>
<p>克萊多說，「常他們叫我的時候我正在堆放秣草，諾娜——我的妻子，其時我們還沒有結婚，雖然她很願意，然而我總堅持在失明期間不和她結婚——諾娜走來吿訴我說眼庫曾有電話來，要他乘下次火車赴紐約。這是去年十月間的事。那時我極其激動，幾乎說不出話來。</p>
<p>『當他們揭去我的舊眼膜時，眼前爲之一亮。他們把新眼膜安上時，我就看見了頭上的燈和醫師的手。他們第一次把綳帶解去時我就看見了醫師的臉。一星期以後我的視力就完全恢復了。』</p>
<h3>好好先生杜魯門作風與羅斯福不同正在採取新的立塲</h3>
<p>— 君默譯述，原載美國哈普雜誌</p>
<p>杜魯門總統，正像一切密蘇里人一樣的，是個脾氣隨和的好好先生，除非人逼得他太過分。而現在，國會是有點逼得他太過分了。最近的跡象顯示，他是不得不跟國會鬥一鬥法了。</p>
<p>在行政上，杜魯門的作風和他的前任大大不同。羅斯福的天性是高遠的理想和政策，例行公事他是不感興趣的，常有許多無趣的案卷會堆在他的辦公桌上後幾個月自己霉爛。而杜魯門却是迅速，爽快的，而且他也賦與了各部的負責人以較大的權力，使許多小事情不必再擁到白宮的桌了上來。</p>
<p>這是很淸楚的，杜魯門自已主要的是個事務的人材，他採用羅斯福的老辦法，因爲他知道這些是有用的。因爲此，羅斯福才史無前例地連任了四次總統，杜魯門不是傻瓜，自然不會把自己這份好遺產丢棄的。他承襲了舊辦法，但又不敢去開罪國會。他底下的一輩人也都是那些希望和人人都弄得好的人，激進派，保守派，一律都和好。民主黨的實際政治領袖郵政總長漢納根和國內政綱的策劃入復員局長史尼德，都是這一套人。他們謹愼，認眞，細心，呆板，羅斯福時代的雄謀大略的智囊團是星散了，他們當初跟着羅斯福，是因爲羅斯福　子裏　　　　來的天堂美夢，而杜魯門却似乎只在應付着些目前的行政，最多是爲了下次的　選。這個缺陷的危險性，恐怕要　一次重大經濟危　來到的時候，才會眞正看得出來·</p>
<p>在理想上，杜魯門不及羅斯福，但在行敢上，杜魯門是超過了羅斯福的。他的國務院陣容之整齊，爲以前所朱有，他把農業部改組，把十四個駢枝的機關大刀闊斧地歸併成了一個生產貿易局。但僅是一個好的行政者並不能成爲個成功的總統，杜魯門自已也很知道。他跨進白宮之初，就曾立下兩個決心，一是要和國會弄好，別和他的前任那樣整天在和國會齟齬；二是要有一個「强力」內閣，分負一部分的行政責任，免得再被人說是「一人獨裁」。他的辦法是想一舉兩得，就是，起用從前國會的議員來做他的閣員。不幸得很，這個辦法一點也沒有成功。第一，和國會的關係並不只是一　　專問題　　　會議　　是一樣的不賣賬，有時，熱悉反而倒是妨礙，第二，國會裏沒有一個人會衷心佩服杜魯門的，美國是個崇拜英雄的社會，羅斯福還能够唬得住他們，杜魯門呢，在這點上就完全不成。　　情形已至如此田地，杜魯門要就是繼續屈服，要就是設法來壓倒國會。最近的跡象顯示，他是在走後一條路。這在三件事情上看得出來，一是他在國會的預算演講，提出把物價統制和原料統制延長十八個月，這和國會的意思顯然是剛剛相背的；二是他在無綫電廣播中直接向人民呼籲；三是他的親身出來調停最近的工潮。這種種都顯示着，杜魯門是正在取着一種新的立塲。</p>
<p>一個大政治家所需要的是遠見，能力和勇敢的判斷。羅斯福似乎是有的，杜魯門也許會證明他也有，雖然現在是還沒有十分看得出來。</p>

<h3>一剎那的晴天</h3>
<p>— 黃徑亞</p>
<p>一星期綿綿的陰雨總算停止了·當烏雲漸漸消失在天際的山後，碧王似的天空就開始遍佈着明亮的陽光，一切都似乎値得讚頌，那遠遠的山眼；澄靜的湖水；帶雨的梧桐，不都蘊蓄着豐富的美，洋溢着生命與活力嗎？</p>
<p>胡廠長的心情，也如這初晴的一刹那，明亮而淸爽，眉間緊鎖憂愁的結，也不覺地解開了，而在面部蒼老的皺紋上，抖開了幾分笑意，他也高與地想，這是一個多好的晴天啊！</p>
<p>午飯後，他踱到屋外的陽台，輕鬆地躺到竹製的長沙發上，一縷陽光從他蒼老的臉，一直透進他蒼老的心，他浸浴在這柔和溫存的氣氛中，快樂與希望撫慰他似乎年靑了。</p>
<p>他謹愼地從袋中取出一張紙，反覆的審視，面部的笑意更爲濃厚。這是一個國家銀行批准工業貸款的通知，他將牠攤開在面前的小茶桌上，然後安詳地抽上二根香烟，看那一樓輕烟溺娜迴繞；在和暖的陽光中升起，漸漸從心靈隱處飄起一絲希望，讓這希望結成了一幅五色繽紛美麗的網。</p>
<p>的確這是値得快樂的：</p>
<p>他是一個工業家，他的工作自然就是辦工廠，從學校畢業後，他就將父親遺下來整份家產放在這個目標上，以二十多年的時間，堅忍不拔的精神，努力去幹，到今天他總算站起來了，在廣大的工業園地當中。</p>
<p>一串不算得短的歲月，他艱辛地克服了多少困難，經過世界不景氣大恐慌浪潮的摧擊，不斷　淡經營與舶來品爭銷路，八年抗戰，他更艱苦地搬了又搬，在一切落後與外斷絕的後方，他也居然照常生產，這是別人都認爲奇蹟的，他却奄不在乎的應付過去了。</p>
<p>勝利的號聲，激動得他流下眼淚，立刻他又設法把工廠遷回了故地，那時他曾高興地朗笑，驕傲地自誇，以前有列强的大砲飛機威迫，而現在呢？自己的國家也是五强之一，總該要翻身了吧！</p>
<p>然而回來後的三個月中，出乎意料的困難，重重的擺在他面前，不由不令他緊鎖眉峯，長吁短嘆，令得他夫人都詫異了。物價閃電似的飛漲，原料價格增加工資頻繁調整，銷路的淡薄，竟像約定了一齊而來，一些活動殼都放了下去，但就像一片小石投人池塘，沒有一點反響。「床頭金盡壯士無顏」，所以他只有急得像　鑲熱鍋上爬，蒼老的面孔陸績刻上了許多生命的紋路。</p>
<p>朋友們勸他停工出頂，或者停工暫避風頭，但是他捨不得丢開，這就是他生命的結晶啊！在最難應付的時候，一些投機的生意朋友又來勸他：</p>
<p>「胡先生，算了吧！我看你還是立刻停工，然後把工廠出頂，或者把原料出賣，湊起十多萬萬，和我合夥做黃金美鈔棉紗生意，包管你三個月不到一本二利，安安然然的過日子，何必整天憂急，這幾天你頭髮都白了不少，唉！又何苦如此呢？」那一雙圓轉的眼珠又在轉動着。</p>
<p>「說一句老實話，辦工廠決勝不過外國人的。人家有百年的基礎，造出的東西那樣不比我們的好，價錢又便宜，還有誰來買又繁脚又貴的國貨，不瞞你老兄說，我家裏就連解大便的紙都是美國貨，嘻嘻！現在世界不同了，嘻嘻……你拿定主意，包管三個月不到一本兩利……·」</p>
<p>在朋友幾乎　成一條綫的笑　注視下，他低下頭猶豫了，「沒有銷路」，「一本兩利」，一次次打擊他的意志，迷糊·混亂·動搖，他喃喃自語「二十年心血……二十年心血……·」</p>
<p>「不！×翁，我決定了，無論如何我要把工廠支持下去，這是我二十年的心血，我不能就此丢掉，現在辦工業雖然困難重重，但政府一定會設法解決的，我決不做投機生意，這種事不是我做的……。」他肯定的拒絕了，工廠就是他生命的結晶，拋掉牠，那他以後竟是爲了什麽生存呢？他必須支持下去。</p>
<p>「現在銷路不好，也是一時的現象將來會改善的，以後國人一定會知道，他們應該買甚麼東西……。」他高興起來了，更淋漓的說：</p>
<p>「你不記得嗎？抗戰以前日貨傾銷，不管日本人怎樣兇，大家還是起來反對，　學生們還去打賣日貨的店舖呢？况且美國又是一個愛和平扶持正義的國家，他決不會毁滅我們，只有將我們扶植起來，……我敢相信，中國工業是有希望的。」他完全忘掉了憂愁困難。</p>
<p>今天忽然接到了這批准貸款</p>
<p>當他幾乎要站起來滑稽地動手勢之時，一陣小孩的吵鬧，如一把利剪，紛紛剪碎了他美麗的網，他站起來想向那草地上嬉戲的子女叱呼，一份剛送來的報紙蓋在通知單之上，一個個大標題觸入他眼簾了。</p>
<p>「五月份入口總額五百餘億，出口總額僅百餘億」，「渝民民工廠一百餘所倒閉」「宋院長宣佈內河航權開放一年」。「美大批物資陸續運華」。　他吸了口冷氣繼續看下去；</p>
<p>「上海牛奶公司大半倒閉，因克梅奶粉充溢市塲，無法競爭之故。據云行總已向美國訂購乳牛萬匹，已在來華途中」。「盧作孚晋京治商救濟津貼，民生公司蝕本卅餘億元」。「××鐵路又遭破壞，各煤礦存煤雖豐，無法運出」。「滬煤氣公司考慮採用印度煤」。</p>
<p>他如書瘧疾似，跌入了嚴寒的冰窖，無力倒在椅上，令籘條吱吱響起來。孩子的吵鬧，清晰傳入他的耳鼓。</p>
<p>「不要哭小寳！明天媽媽買個洋娃娃給你」。</p>
<p>「媽！我要美國的，中國的不好」。</p>
<p>「媽！我要買一條美國玻璃皮帶，人家同學都有了……」。</p>
<p>「媽媽！報上登美國呢絨已有一批運到，我想明天去做套西裝，哦！吉普卡也有一批發售了，媽，你叫爸爸買一部吧」！「媽媽！媽媽！昨天我看見隔壁關家姐姐穿的一件美國蔴布旗袍，我也想做一件。你不是說要買蜜絲佛陀化裝品嗎？明天我們一塊去惠羅公司好……」。</p>
<p>「哦！二實你從那裘來，跑得一身汗」。</p>
<p>「媽！我剛從外灘回來，媽媽，你看我買了一罐咖啡一聽冰淇淋粉，都是Made　in　U．S．A．這筒茶葉也是美國貨呢！你猜多少錢……」。</p>
<p>他茫茫拿起被遮蓋的通知單，那一行數字，糢糊地小下去，好像只留下一張白紙，而報紙上的標題反而更大起來，大得遮滿了整個眼眶。彷彿那一張狡猾肥胖的面孔又出現了，「哼！看你去和外國人比，一塊小石頭想擋住洶湧的大浪……」。「有誰來買又蹩脚又貴的國貨，好！我看你成功」。「可惜行政院長不是你做哩」！</p>
<p>天氣非常涼爽，正適合穿夾衣，但他郤感到酷熱，有如赤裸裸躺在烈日下，煎熬得難受。</p>
<h3>說話</h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>我最最不會說話，但是最歡喜聽人家說話。</p>
<p>有一次聽二位年輕小姐說話，一個說：「你看呀，我眞是大上其當，出來的時候明明雨點很大，只好拖拖累累穿着雨衣，那裏知道現在太陽這樣好了，多討厭！」另一個嗤的一笑道：「這件漂亮的雨衣又是表哥送你的嗎？「第一個扭扭揑揑起來，聲音裏帶着驕傲：「誰要他送，倒霉啦！」另一個似笑非笑地披了披嘴，說道：「但是有許多女人就是不怕倒霉，就免這樣賤！」第一個的粉臉有些變了：「只可惜有些女人要賤也沒人要呢！」另一個也不客氣了：「是呀！所以我常常說，像你這樣的美人，勾搭勾搭我們那個　表哥，實在可惜！若是放在上海跳舞塲裏，生意眞不知要如何興隆呢！」一聽這話，第一個勃然大怒：「什麽話？你要不要吃耳光？」另一個直跳起來：「吃耳光，吃耳光，吃你這賤貨的耳光？」……你一句，我一聲，最後越弄越不條話，我不敢再聽下去了。</p>
<p>後來一打馳，原來那二位小姐是情敵，怪不得說不上三旬話，就吵鬧起來。</p>
<p>不過即不是情敵，即使是最要好的朋友，最恩愛的夫妻，最最體面堂皇的大官大員，說說話，也往往有好好開塲，吵鬧收塲的。</p>
<p>說話之間，就難免不有衝突</p>
<p>許多人以爲說話是一種技術，我則以爲說話好像播種：你播出的是荆棘毒芒，收回的也是荆棘毒芒；你播出的是鮮花香草，收回的也是鮮花香草。</p>
<h3>青春</h3>
<p>— 史蒂</p>
<p>你以你寳貴的靑春而向人誇矜麽？你錯了，你應該認一認這裏是何等樣的國土。靑春在有些國土裏是輝煌的皇冕，在有些國土裏是鑽石珠寳，可以用錢買來鑲嵌紳士淑女們的戒指和項圈，而在有些國土裏，却祗是草尖的凝露。</p>
<p>草尖的凝露在淸晨也該有它光瑩的瞬刻，而在有些國土裏沒待到一絲曉風的撫拂，一綫晨光的照射，早給慓悍的騎蹄踐進了泥土。</p>
<p>至於你自己，我勸你認一認，你究竟置身在何等的領域？你的靑春在你的國土裏究竟成就了些什麼？</p>
<p>爲踐落在泥土裏無聲的逝者哭罷！戴上荊棘之冠，待冠上的露珠將乾，你正可綴以散落在你脚邊的淚點的珍珠。</p>
<p>沒有皇冕，然而你還是光輝的，你的晶瑩明澈更有勝於鑽石和珠實。</p>
<p>你的靑春將不再寂寞。是的，因此你還値得誇耀。的通知單，你想他怎不如久雨中忽然見到明朗的天空般快樂呢？</p>
<p>他似乎成了一隻雲雀，高傲地翱翔在希望的雲天。</p>
<p>貸款來了，他渡過了這苦難的時期，以後工廠裏生產速率增加，貨品有極大的改良，在國人中普遍得到相信，一筆筆溢出的利息，變成一座座新式的工廠，在那綠色平原後面，矗立着數不淸烟囱，早上軋軋機器聲，驚起了林中的宿鳥，傍晚放工的汽笛，驅散屋頂交織着的蝙蝠在馬路上飛馳着工人自開回家的汽車。</p>
<p>全國工業繁盛的建立起來了，他們的貨品也由雄偉的船隊載送到國外遼遠的市塲，在那裏，人們嘖嘖的稱贊，「這是中國貨呢！」</p>
<p>他還有些享受慾望，蒼老的綫紋也許會消失在舒適的生活中。他會伴着裝束入時的太太，在瑞士避暑，閒逸地並肩觀阿爾卑斯山未濬的雪，在南洋羣島過冬，人家冷得打抖之時，他們正高興沐着碧綠的海波，拾起猴子從椰梢擲下的菓實解渴。間或他們會到摩天大樓去乘涼，白金漢宮前徘徊，巴黎梧桐蔭蓋下的大道散步，渥太華或者布宜諾斯艾利斯的歡迎會上，發表工業演講………。</p>
<h3>威爾斯論</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>威爾斯的小說，有羅曼斯，有性格小說，有革命小說，有幻想和諷刺的短篇，我們嚴肅地硏究他的作品和影響，究竟把他歸入哪一類好呢？烏托邦的羅曼斯，織在「機會的輪子」（The　Wheels　of　Chance　1895），「吉潑斯」（Kipps，1905）和「海上女子」（The　Sea　Lady，1902）裏的幽默屬於他早年的文學啓示。近些年來，他失去了不少玩笑的幽默和烏托邦的幻景；他更加爲社會和政治的糾紛而憂傷，以致最近的代表長簾小說發出無休止的反抗的調子。他企圖逃到心靈的更大的領域，以改造者和哲學家的姿態向世界挑戰。這樣的調子在「吐奴笨基」（Tono-Bungay，1909）「安維洛尼伽」（Ann　Veronica，1909）以及「新墨基亞威里」（The　New　Machiavelli，1910）的篇頁裏頗多。及至「蒲里特令的達見」（Mr．Briteing　Sees　It　Through，1916）和「威廉克里校爾的世界」（The　World　of　William　Clissold，1926）出版後，這傾向更加顯著。在第一次歐戰時，他的多方面的著作讀者極多，評論者亦多，他的小說和「世界史綱」（Outline　of　History，1920）幾成爲預言。也有的批評家不稱他爲小說家，却稱他爲宣傳家；也有人稱他爲裝模作樣的人，說他那反語使人厭倦，不過却有很大的影響。他時常改變立塲；不加聲明，立刻會走到相反的途徑上去，但對於同情的讀者，他那急進的矛盾似乎是頗爲誠懇的。他的性格是複雜而有磁力的。他的思想不是傳統的，而是脫離傳統標準的。白里斯福（J．D．Beresfold）說：「其實，威爾斯是正常的，他早年的幻想並不曾因了父母，敎師和同學的敎訓而受到挫折。」</p>
<p>威爾斯生於英國的布洛木來（Bromley）。他的父親是職業棍球家，但他開商店却失敗了。他的母親是塞塞克期（Sussex）旅館老闆的女兒，結婚前還做過女僕，後來仍回到彼得園附近的上公園做女僕頭腦。這種環境的回憶都增飭地叙在吐奴笨基的前數章裏。他受過的敎育有限，十三歲就在藥房裏做店櫃的夥訂。十六歲以前還做過布店的學徒，先在溫座爾（Windsor），後來在南海。他以免費生的資格得入南懇星吞（Kensington）的科學師範學院，正在「變愛與路易茲漢君」（Love　and　Lewisham，1900）裏面的主人翁一樣。他跟隨赫胥黎硏究，得到生物物物學的榮譽獎章；他對於赫胥黎的回憶都寫在「佐安與彼得」（Joan　and　Peter，1918）裏面。當時，他說他正在「倫敦閒蕩」，參加政治的大集曾，聽摩里斯講求社會主義，格蘭斯頓講家規，布刺德羅講無神論。」</p>
<p>他在聖的翰林任過短時期的校長。他寫過一本生物學的敎科書，還算成功。因了漢立（W．E．Henley）的鼓勵，他寫散文和批評投給包爾邁爾雜誌（Poll　Mlall　Magazine），兩週評論和別的雜誌。不久，他就寫第一批幻想的傳奇小說，如「時間機」（The　Time　Machine，1895），「世界戰爭」（The　War　of　the　World　1898）之類。從一八九五到一九〇五，這十年間預言式的小說頗爲流行，如李頓（Lytton）的「未來的種族」（The　Coming　Race）·畢拉美（E．Bellamy）的「向向向後看」（Looking　Backward）之類。威爾斯改變他的觀點，與早期的機械故事不同，但他的基本觀點總還是一樣的—帶着貴族的尊貴，以反抗和不從國敎爲口號，需要自由。公正和「凈化的文明」。在世界戰爭一書中他以個人的勇敢來反對「好戰之士」。</p>
<p>在幻想傳奇以後兩部更寫實的小說就是「結婚」（Marriage，1912）和新墨基亞威里，這兩郃書與吐奴笨基同屬於自傳性質的小說。吐奴笨基中的主角，本是潛水艇的工程師，因爲貧困，不得不從事於他所不喜歡的職業，猶之於結婚中的科學家，爲了需要金錢的緣故，從實騐室裏被趕出來經商。新墨基亞威里寫出他兒時對於倫敦的印象，並不曾精密地作過計畫的發展；「那時代使我受不住，當地都是些受東縛的人民，即即即有自由和權力，也不能起一點文化上的作用。」在他看來，布洛木來只是「沉悶。無用。出了氣的人類活動，只是一大堆沒用的東西。」他更猛烈地攻擊社會及其人民，他的小說響出了破壞的調子，甚過於反抗——一個人的熱情或社會的凶惡的傳統把人生破壞了。他認爲「混亂的世界」在戰後更加混亂。這種破壞的極點，便是「威廉克里梭爾的世界」，不過仍懷有對於將來的　攏的希望，這本書裏反映出作者計於外的生活的反應和內的對於不可獲得者的努力爭取。</p>
<p>閱報，驚悉英國小說家威爾斯在一九四六年八月十三日下午四時平安逝世。他患有糖尿症，精神本來欠佳。因取馬伯爾「英美小說硏究」移譯此節，以作紀念。威爾斯的「世界史綱」有梁思成的譯本，商務版。又「簡明世界史」「生命之科學」「未來世界」也都有譯本。小說方面，伍蠡甫節譚過「安維洛尼伽」。記得文明書局所出「火星與地球之戰爭」「二十萬年後之世界」也是威爾斯的作品。林琴南似曾譯過「明限人」，即「蒲里特令的達見」。我買過一本威爾斯的科學短篇小說集，贈與顧均正先生，他似乎不曾譯過。威爾斯的小說對於中國新文壇的影響是極微的。</p>
<h3>一寸同河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風　９</p>
<p>「駐「滿」參謀木部電訊課電訊存底摘錄一束；</p>
<p>令—駐平軍特：按預定計劃，現決於於七月八日晨零時，在預定之要衝地區，發動事變。</p>
<p>目的（一）·製造事件，作外交藉口；（二）·在兵不血刃之可能範圍內，征服華北五省，作征服大陸基地。（三）·製造事件，必須事前妥善佈置。此令—七，四。</p>
<p>令—駐平軍特：事變發動之軍事配合行動，須（一）·立時佔領宛盧一帶，扼制平漢咽喉；（二）·乘虛進駐北平，控制會談地區；（三）·豐台駐軍行動，須六小時內，經廊房，到達楊村，割斷平津綫，在可能下，迅速奪駐津總站，遙應事變中心。此令七，六。</p>
<p>令—事變報吿閱悉，發動事件方式甚妥當，時刻準確，可佳。速遵計劃進展。此令——七，八，晨二時。</p>
<p>令，加急—報吿閱悉，失蹤案內之失踪兵士，雖係被迫歸隊，乃偵　方式不健全，實爲過失，現緩處罰。事變事，仍須凜遵旣定計劃，强硬圓滑進行。此令—七，八，晨八時。</p>
<p>令，加急—失踪兵士歸隊案，旣探明係支特務行爲，乃陰謀打擊我計劃作態，宜速圍剿平宛區內支特務活動。至要。此令—七，八，晨八時。</p>
<p>令，特急—加速査明K．C．C．化名，膽敢來電，諷刺本部，速逮捕，或格殺。此令——又。</p>
<p>令——駐平軍特：我駐軍力薄，可佯攻宛盧，試探佔領平津。加緊交涉，强滑並用，待援。駐滿，鮮，我大軍已出動。此令—七，十二，十三時。</p>
<p>令—駐平軍特：昨我內閣已議決，按預定計劃，實行武力解決支那，作實施田中計劃初步行動。我駐支各地潛力已加緊發動；迅速聯絡，配合行動。此令—七，十二，十六時。」</p>
<p>自從七月十一，近衛按某種旣定秘謀，通過全體內閣，發動大東亞戰爭，四日以來，我們收到各聯絡站很多報吿，都與「七封秘緘」有密切的關係。</p>
<p>尤其是七月十三，東京〇一六號來訊，探悉正本「秘緘，」確在近衛府邸，現正趕製節本二册，一交陸軍首腦，一交海軍首腦；並另已複製副本，作最高軍事會議時參考之用。</p>
<p>最呌鶴見焦躁的，是七月十五晨三時半，所得總站〇六的報吿：「蘭組首腦頃自東京抵瀋，據有根據「秘緘」大綱之軍事行動方案。」這當然指明土肥原勢力，顯然已經駕凌梅·松·兩組之上了。</p>
<p>我們自從收到這個報吿後，睡意已經打消，用心斟酌起來。鶴見感覺最不安的一點，是由於他把關於七封秘械的消息，已經通知中國特務方面，說明秘緘的關係，如何影響世界安寗，又負責要把這個秘密的內容探明，加以破壞。</p>
<p>現在不僅沒有探明秘緘內容，倒是被那個邀功的吸血魔王土肥原，捷足先登，搶到了發動大戰的方案。年靑人天然好勝，何况鶴見，他覺得好像華方的特務首腦，就在他身邊，責問他爲什麼不趕快動作，以致全世界生靈，免不了要遭一番慘酷的大刧？他感覺到慚愧。</p>
<p>我深深知道鶴見的脾氣，他絕對不歡迎勸慰式的解釋，更用不着鼓勵；惟一的方法，就如用對待活潑聰慧的兒童一般，媲他懊喪的當口，趕快提起另外一種題目，來轉移他的興趣：</p>
<p>「爲什麽不回瀋陽，先同土肥原開個小玩笑，再上東京一趟，試試偸天換日的手段？」我知道上東京探取秘械的事，簡直無異拿性命當作兒戲。日本的密探，已經够人對付，還要加上蘭·梅·松三組的反間諜網，佈置周密得像天羅地網一般；此外，還有德國的第五縱隊，參加防術的都是好手。可是我也知道，即使我不說出這一點，他始終也是要回國試試手段的。</p>

<h3>全部神經戰</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>外滙新調整，有人將它比作經濟原子彈，十九日全天引起市塲大混亂，一陣瘋狂的颶風。上海人本來就神經脆弱，於是更歇斯的里起來。美國作家辛克萊在「錢魔」裏所描寫的—「像海中的墨魚羣似的，拚命追逐那一絲絲的光亮」，就在我們眼前表演着。</p>
<p>傳聞不去談（據說十七日即有人以六萬萬元收買美鈔），我知道有個朋友在十八日調動四千萬元頭寸，一部汽車兜遍了全上海的所有大小錢莊，結果並未買到一元美金，於是退而思其次，他買了兩千萬元的美國香烟。</p>
<p>這一類的故事，發生在昨前兩天的大上海，多得不可勝數。至於質兩聽克甯奶粉，買三瓶魚肝油精丸，……那更是很尋常的事。</p>
<p>時間即黃金，就在十八十九兩天中，知道有多少歡樂多少淚呀；但，汽油從一千三百元一加侖又回到原來價錢了，黃金又跌到二三〇，……一切　神話似的，你沒有任何理由來解釋這暴漲暴落的道理，如果有理由，那祗有一個，投機。</p>
<p>全部神經戰，你感到可怕，那你還是你；否則，你的口袋裏將多出若干鈔票來。</p>
<p>有一個銀行界的朋友說：最喫虧的是我們沒有美鈔的朋友，因爲有美鈔咸外滙，他可以用來抵銷高漲的物價，兩無損失，而沒有的人，即不能從新調整得到什麼，反從物價高漲中又增多支出。</p>
<h3>匯率更改</h3>
<p>— 楊謀</p>
<p>時事雜感</p>
<p>霹靂一聲，外滙率調整了。</p>
<p>經過戰爭磨練的人們，對於經濟的感覺特別地敏感。大家都預兆到：市塲人造的混亂，物價　口的竄升。</p>
<p>儘管政府諄諄勸吿，但是，外匯的調整，畢竟被投機者利用了，帶來市塲中一片風彼。許多商店中的物品暫時失蹤了，或者碼子已經變了，美鈔，黃金，證券，當然不肯錯過機會的。</p>
<p>外滙調整，在政府用心良苦，但是，結果有人在歡笑，有人在暗哭，眞是演成一幅悲慘殘酷的圖畫。有人在宰割人家，有人在被人家宰割，不過，弄得啼笑皆非的人，大多還是因爲自己太實得，太狠心！前日一天中，投機的人，弄得落花流水者不知凡　！</p>
<p>不過訂購洋貨的，手裏有的是美金條子的，囤了大批貨色的，該大開慶功宴了。眞所謂不費吹灰之力，一夜之間，就糊裏糊塗辈的替目己的資產平空添上了許多『零』字。這批人，原只望的物價大天漲，漲，漲，自己的財產也能日進千里，固然，「皇天不負苦心人」，「囤貨千日，用在一朝」，就看今日的顏色！</p>
<p>最苦的還是公務員，待遇剛增了一點，加的錢還沒有到手，物價却毫不容情的上去了。這一點，爲政者應當迅速拿出兌現的辦法！</p>
<p>外滙調整了，許多人在拿人家的鮮血作爲美酒，熱烈的慶祝看發財大業。也有人在哀哀暗泣，爲生活擔憂，爲將來流淚！國家的政策，必須顧及大體，難免有許多人要吃虧，但是，對這些生享其成吮血的魔王奸商們，也總應該有制裁！</p>
<h3>韋爾斯　論人格</h3>
<p>— 郁芬節錄韋爾斯自傳</p>
<p>英國大文豪韋爾斯，著作等身，不幸於本月十三日溘然長辭，享年七十九歲，遺著凡百餘種，塵不傳誦一時，尤以所著「世界史綱」及「未來世界」兩書，旁徵博引，精警入微！氏有「韋爾斯自傳」一集問世，對於個人之家世，生活經歷，以及當時社會，政治，經濟情形，均有詳盡之評述，本文爲韋氏對於人格之論述·爰節錄如次，以見氏之思想與風格之一斑耳。</p>
<p>所謂人格，是一個人對於自己私有的槪念，他希望自己做那一種人，希望別人如何看待他那種觀念。牠因此提供一個標準，他根據這個標準可以判斷自己能够做什麼，應該做什麽，以及必須做什麽，個個人都有一個人格，沒有人格，自我行爲和自我解釋就不可能。</p>
<p>人格也許是非常固定的，也許變化得非常厲害，牠也許是絕對忠實的，也許牠的有些原素或全部原素是從幻想的領域內吸取來的·牠可以帶着各種各樣的姿態·存在於同一的人的精神裏·我們可以有單個的人格，也可以有好幾重的人格，而在後一情態之下，我們內心就充滿了矛盾，使我們自身和我們的朋友都跌入迷惘中。我們的人格像我們一樣地生長，變化，衰老，牠們難得是我們有知覺的精神本體之整體。各種各樣的混合物都是不完全地互相聯繫着，或根本沒有聯繫，也許會在一種完全意想不到的情態中帶着我們跑開了。</p>
<p>人格許會根本就是虛偽的東，例如許多在徒的人格一樣·牠也許是用以塡補空虛的妄想的機構，例如許多自尊自大的人一樣·但不能因此就斷定一個人　着他的情懷和動機精選出來的一個人格，也是自欺的工作。如果一個人能够依照自己想定的應如何行動的計劃而行動，他許會非常忠實地抑制·無視，甚至取消自己許多固有的動機和傾向，愉快的僞君子的假面，——人格———最後就變成他的眞面目了！</p>
<h3>外匯　放長</h3>
<p>電話裏</p>
<p>甲：喂！喂；老張是嗎？吿訴你一個緊急消息，外匯放長了，昨晚才得的消息，條子一定漲！</p>
<p>乙：眞的？喂喂，爲什麽不早吿訴我！昨天的一批定貨還沒付欵呢！糟了，糟了，條子沒買進，美鈔最近倒賣出了，唉，唉！你趕快到店裏去關照不許開市交易，聽聽風聲再講！</p>
<p>店裏</p>
<p>經理：怎樣，賬算出了嗎？虧蝕多少？</p>
<p>會計：昨天和今天的行情一個上下要相差八千多萬！</p>
<p>經理：那怎麼行：又沒有頭寸！那！那那唉！誰知道這倒霉的美國貨害了我這個貿易公司！破產了，破產了！</p>
<p>飯店裏</p>
<p>賬房：先生，請照價目單加五成計算！</p>
<p>住客：爲什麽？同業公會議定的？</p>
<p>賬房：美鈔漲了·來不及公議，先行加價五成！</p>
<h3>北站所見</h3>
<p>— 痴墨</p>
<p>跑單帮的雖然少了，可是沒有絕跡，三五成羣的依舊來往，所帶去的上海貨，大都是毛巾·糖·捲烟之類，一堆一堆的貨如山積，這些跑單帮者，其間很多少婦，她們與員工及路警，感情相當好，談話時總是有說有笑的，這與過去「黑帽子」們「認票不認人」之作風，逈然不同了。</p>
<p>售票處窗口，牌上明明寫着售票時間爲「一點四十分」，但是到了「一點五十五分」才開始售票，據說每次要延遲刻把鐘，不知什麽理由，也許是「新生活運動」應該要如此。</p>
<p>天氣這樣的熱，排隊購車票者還是這麼的擁，擠得汗流浹背，彷彿似皮匠擔上鞋子中的「楦頭」，腹背被軋得連呼吸也爲難了，而且距離賣票時間，尙有兩個多鐘點，實在令人不耐煩啦，所幸「黃牛黨」們已復員，「黑市票照常供應」，二等車票到杭州的，祗賣得六千，雖然，比較售價大些，但是並不貴，省得軋了，於是乎買他一張，牠們人頭極熱，雖是一天進賬不少，不過「黑心銅鈿公平用」，如果是「關窗嚼」而「獨呑」，那麽，有「跌」進去的可能。</p>
<p>在三等售票處的地方，活像難民羣的流亡圖，站着的，蹲着的。席地而坐的，大小包裹行李，箱子貨物，一種騷亂複雜的情形，實在不容易描寫，每一秒鐘有生動的特寫鏡頭，穴然之間，在人潮中一個年輕的旅客，兩手扭住了兩個「扒孩」，這兩孩子，看上去祗不過十一二歲的樣子，可是「隔年蚊子」　非常「老口」，他們仗着年紀小，不惹人注意，便從容撈混水魚，拎包裹，　袋袋，據云，這種「扒孩」，於十幾個，專在「北站」行竊，而且這批小扒　的服裝很整潔，希望路警注意，最好警局拘捕後，送交兒童敎養院，須經過長期的感化咧。</p>

<h3>傀儡皇帝溥儀　一人物素描</h3>
<p>— 錢蕃甫</p>
<p>辛亥革命將他從寳座趕下來，他的頭頂上一直拖着那一條「國故」，「國寳」的辮子，不少老臣和遺老，都把這一條辮子認爲「大淸帝國」復興的象徵。但是亨利要結婚，未婚妻要他把這一條「豬尾巴」截掉，才肯嫁他。這條辮子，天熱就發癢，他早就想將它去掉了的，可是他知道一開口，那幾個長鬍鬚的「老臣」準定反對，他把這意思吿訴她，她呸了他一聲：「睜眼看淸楚·像你這年紀的男孩，那有留辮子的，多不方便：……」</p>
<p>中華民國十年五月三日—頤和園內的「宣統十三年」，他攝了垂辮的最後一張照相，沐浴齋戒，吿祭太廟……侍詔替他梳好最時髦的花旗裝，又攝了一張差點兒連自己都認不出來的少年公子照片，當然，身上是一套一九二一年的洋服。</p>
<p>老臣們歎息連聲，他們索性閉門不聞外事。「大淸」就此乾乾凈凈了。</p>
<p>亨利，　儀夫婦滿不在乎，他們以爲現在的少年人，嘴裏哼不出外國話是最坍台的事，他們請了一位英國紳士—約翰斯頓敎英文，當然，他們希望也有一個英文名字，因爲她聽見兩個男女學生「喬治」，「瑪麗」的互相喊呼得有趣。於是約翰先生替他們起名亨利和伊麗莎白·那是兩個英國帝后的名字，可惜都已經躦入了墳墓，但是他們並未領略了這裏面的諷譏含義。</p>
<p>亨利曾一度想做一個詩人，可是吟出來的警句不是平仄不對工，便是令人費解。他總算知難而退。</p>
<p>「九一八」事變，亨利因爲每年的開支都是中國政府撥給，他不願得罪他的「衣食父母」，所以起先他曾大聲表示：「決不爲敵方利用！」但是，夫妻一商量，現在百物騰貴，中國政府給他們的歲給依舊祗有四百萬，不但生活比不上那些闊佬，連麻將也不敢搓大的……土肥原那個矮子答應他，祗要……那時食的—用的，簡直不用愁了。人生不過百年，樂得享現成。</p>
<p>於是，他做了傀儡皇帝，滿以爲可以穩渡一輩子的，他夢想不到……</p>
<p>眼前，他成爲全球囑目的「問題人物」，祗爲當初的一念……。其實，他不過是許多凡人中間的一個，因爲他具有一個常人的全部慾望。</p>
<h3>一笑</h3>
<p>— 陶煒</p>
<p>先生：我像你這樣年紀時，先生敎我們的書，只需一兩遍，我就懂得了，眞不像你那樣的笨，已經敎了七八遍，還是一點也不懂。</p>
<p>學生：這是你的先生比我的好，我的先生不及你的先生呀！</p>
<h3>高利貸</h3>
<p>— 承連</p>
<p>最近我們辦事的地方半年結算，這原是極平常的事，然而得了個頗出意外的結果；那便是單只利息一項就超過了事務費—包括全體職工的　津和膳食及其他的開支。</p>
<p>我們不能否認這鐵般的事實：外貨的傾銷，和高利貸的盤剝，巳使工商業到了山窮水盡，行將破產的地步。而高利貸更是敲骨刮髓，無孔不入地伸展着。</p>
<p>社會上不知有多少人在靠着高利貸過活，有的直接放出，也有「掮客」逐利其間。翻開報紙的分類廣吿，也可以找到現款出借」那些字樣，誠然，一個擁有三，五百萬現鈔者，靠利子的收人也能過不差的生活了，</p>
<p>高利貸之風不但盛行在都市裏，並也很迅速地吹擊到內地的小鄉鎭和農村，而利息之高更是嚇人聽聞，普遍一個月加三成，但四成咸五成的也有，並且十天，一星期結算利息。小商人借了高利貸永遠不要想翻身，屋層的盤剝，利子滾上利子，直滾得那些小商店關門淸理爲止。</p>
<p>至於在農村裏更索興不以利息計算了。靑黃不接的時候，農人們借一祖米，在秋收的時期還兩祖。也有「賣靑米」的，那便一担米只作三份之一的市價。「預的」賣出，先收錢，到秋割時交貨。這實在是椿非常冒險的事，不問受得住這重利的盤剝，即秋收的把握他們也都沒有，然他們不能不這樣做，爲了生活。</p>
<p>我們也曾見到政府有低利的貸款，然而似乎都變了質，眞正能到工廠，商店，農人手中究竟有多少。</p>
<p>借高利貸無異飲鳩止渴，但他們都不是笨人，只是在沒有辦法之中祇能這樣做了，顧了目前顧不來將來。</p>
<p>在高利貸的重壓下，一切的工商，農業，已只剩了遊絲似的最後一口氣，然而高利貸之風却正方興未艾，這樣下去，也許連　遊絲似的氣也快會沒有了。</p>

<h3>Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart Return to Beijing Separately - Dined Together That Evening and Exchanged Opinions - Seeking Ways to Resume Peace Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kuling, 20th] Marshal Ma left Kuling at 2:20 PM on the 20th to return to Beijing, accompanied by Military Advisor Pi Zongkan. It is reported that Marshal Ma's descent from the mountain this time will involve exchanging opinions with Ambassador Stuart in Beijing regarding the results of his discussions with the Chairman in Kuling, continuing to work for peace. It is also reported that Marshal Ma may ascend Mount Lu again at the end of this week.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kuling, 20th] Marshal Marshall departed Kuling at 2 PM on the 20th for Nanking, flying to Beijing. Before his departure, he invited Yu Dawei for an extensive discussion. In addition to his meeting with Marshal Ma, Yu visited the Chairman twice, at 8 AM and 7 PM, and reported to President Song in Shanghai via long-distance telephone as Marshal Ma was departing. It is reported that President Chiang visited Marshal Ma last night at 7 PM and dined with him at his headquarters, with Yu also present, discussing matters until 10 PM.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Peiping, 20th] Ambassador Stuart, accompanied by his secretary Fu Jingbo and Tao Lu, flew to Beijing aboard Marshal Ma's special plane at 9 AM on the 20th. Peterson of the US Army and others accompanied him, while Robeson and others saw him off. Before his departure, Ambassador Stuart also had a long conversation with Rao.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanking, 20th] Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart separately flew back to Beijing from Mount Lu and Peiping on the 20th. At 7:30 PM that evening, Stuart drove to Marshal Ma's residence on Ninghai Road for dinner, and to discuss how to promote the resumption of negotiations between the Nationalists and the Communists. Marshal Ma's plane landed at Dajiaochang Airport at 6:10 PM. After Marshal Ma disembarked, he entered the waiting car. During the brief time while the engine was starting, a reporter leaned in to interview him. The reporter asked if peace negotiations would reopen after his return to Beijing, to which he replied, "I think so." When asked about his feelings regarding the recent criticism from the Communist Party, he replied, "I have no opinion on any criticism." Marshal Ma also told the reporter with a smile that Mrs. Ma was doing well in Kuling and that he himself might return to Mount Lu soon. He then said goodbye to the reporter and sped into the city in a Ford car. According to Major General Pi Zongkan, a military advisor accompanying Marshal Ma, the special envoy stayed in Kuling for eight days and visited President Chiang twice. The second visit was on the eve of his return to Beijing, during which they had a long conversation for several hours, with Minister Yu Dawei acting as translator.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kuling, 20th] Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei brought his plan and charts for the restoration of transportation to Kuling this time for the President's review and also submitted them to Marshal Ma for reference. Detailed charts were also drawn regarding the recent damage to the Xuzhou-Zhengzhou section of the Longhai Railway by the Communist army. It is reported that Marshal Ma expressed his indignation after reading them. The Ministry of Transportation's plan to restore transportation focuses on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, which is currently divided into three sections, with the goal of making the entire line operational first.</p>
<h3>Ceasefire and Reorganization of the Government - Ambassador Stuart Advocates Simultaneous Progress - Paying Attention to Inflammatory Broadcasts by the Communist Party</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanking, 20th] Ambassador Stuart, who flew from Beijing to Peiping a week ago to handle affairs at Yenching University, returned to Beijing at 11:30 AM on the 20th. His personal advisor Chuan Jingbo and Yenching University President Lu Zhiwei accompanied him. As the Ambassador will be staying in Beijing for an extended period, a large number of utensils, antiques, calligraphy, and paintings were sent by another plane. After arriving at the embassy, the Ambassador met with reporters at 4:30 PM, with Advisor Chuan Jingbo present. The Ambassador expressed extreme anxiety about the escalation of the Chinese civil war, saying, "If both sides continue to fight like this, not only both sides but also the entire people of the country will suffer terrible sacrifices." He also said, "I regard China as my second home and have unlimited concern," and fell silent for a long time. The Ambassador paid close attention to the inflammatory broadcasts from the Communist Party's Zhangjiakou broadcasting station on the 19th, and the reporter was invited to give a detailed account. The Ambassador further stated that the current problems in China, a ceasefire and the reorganization of the government, are equally important and should proceed simultaneously. When he mentioned the rumors that the United States would change its China policy and completely withdraw from China (including the US military), he said, "If American public opinion is like that, Washington may change its China policy, but that is not the case now. The withdrawal of the US military will plunge China into a more chaotic situation." The reporter then asked the Ambassador what impression he had of President Chiang's message, to which he replied, "I very much agree." The Ambassador concluded by saying, "I am determined to continue to work for peace in China, and Marshal Ma has no plans to return home." During the half-hour conversation with the reporters, we deeply felt the Ambassador's sincerity, which was admirable, and he did not have a pessimistic outlook.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanking, 20th] According to reliable sources today, Marshall telephoned Zhou Enlai from Kuling on Sunday, saying that the government is now planning to expand its position and asking if the Communist Party could provide a list of candidates for the reorganized government. It is reported that Zhou replied to Marshall by telegram on the same day, rejecting the request.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanking, 20th] After Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart returned to Beijing, they did not invite Zhou Enlai for discussions that evening, nor did they speak to Zhou by telephone. Throughout the day on the 20th, Zhou had no activities other than visiting Liao Zhongkai's tomb at 9 AM with Liao Chengzhi and members of the Communist Party delegation. The 20th was the 21st anniversary of Liao's assassination.</p>
<h3>The Government Continues to Request Mediation by the Military Mediation Department - The National Army Still Firmly Defends Datong - Houma Station on the Southern Section of the Tongpu Railway Recovered</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanking, 20th] The battle situation in Datong is proceeding fiercely in a back-and-forth state. The Communist army has approached the outskirts of the city, but after several fierce attacks, although Shacen was captured by the Communist army, Caofulou is still in the hands of the National Army. Therefore, for more than a week, the Communist army's offensive against Datong, although paid with a great price, the city of Datong remains impregnable. The Tongpu Railway has been cut into three sections. The Communist army in the Fen River Plain, in counties such as Wenshui and Jiaocheng, has launched another offensive. Houma Station on the southern section of the Tongpu Railway has been recovered by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Peiping, 20th] The Datong group of the Military Mediation Department, because the Communist representative has left the city and not returned, after the government and the American group returned to Peiping, the government believes that Datong should continue to be mediated under the fierce attack of the Communist army. Therefore, the Communist side was notified the day before yesterday, explaining that the Communist side should send another representative to mediate. The Communist side has agreed but has not yet sent one. Also, because Datong was attacked, after the government submitted a memorandum to the Communist side stating that the National Army has the freedom to take action to aid the Datong garrison, the Communist side indicated that it would express its response in conjunction with the Communist Party's response to the joint statement by Ma and Stuart.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Peiping, 20th] The three members of the Military Mediation Department held another meeting yesterday to fully mediate the conflict and unresolved issues in Jehol, and decided to reiterate the previous order, ordering the Chaoyang, Chengde, and Chifeng groups to continue to contact the highest commanders of the National and Communist armies in Jehol. As for the date and agenda, it will be decided by a joint meeting of the groups, and the location will still be in Pingquan.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Peiping, 20th] Military news: The Communist army has transferred three more brigades from Central Hebei to Datong, with more than ten mountain guns attached, to help fight in the outer areas on the east, west, and south sides of Datong. Fu Zuoyi arrived in Peiping and inquired about the illness of Ma Zhanshan last night. Ma Jingchuan will airlift a part of his current force stationed in Baotou to Datong for reinforcement and asked to contact the air force authorities, urging them not to neglect supplies due to the slightly unsafe airport.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Peiping, 20th] A certain military official told reporters that large-scale battles have been continuing around Datong for a week. More than 50,000 Communist troops, commanded jointly by He Long and Nie Rongzhen, fiercely attack Datong six times every night. The attacking troops often number several thousand or even more than ten thousand. The number of defending troops is far less than that of the Communist army, but their morale is extremely high, and their combat performance is excellent. The spokesperson said that the battle of Datong can provide the Chinese people with information to judge national affairs: (1) Who is fighting whom? (2) Who has more soldiers, and who has fewer soldiers? (3) Whose side does the people's hearts lean towards, and who does it turn away from?</p>
<h3>Cheng Qian Arrives in Kuling and Speaks</h3>

<p>[Central News Agency, Kuling, 20th] Cheng Qian, Director of the Wuhan Pacification Headquarters, arrived in Kuling at 5 PM on the 20th to report on his duties. According to his statement to reporters, since the Communist army led by Li Xiannian in Hubei province violated the agreement and fled westward, triggering a month-long battle, it has now been completely pacified. Only small pockets of about 2,000 troops each remain in the mountainous areas between Zhuxi, Xingshan, and Fangxian in the west, and between Huangmei and Yingshan in the east, which are still to be cleared. Order in all recovered areas will be restored, and the people are returning one after another. The Pacification Headquarters is currently seeking to revive the rural economy and culture.</p>
<h3>A New Political Zone Established in the Ming Palace Site in the Capital - Ministry of Interior Ordered to Preside</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanking, 20th] Confirmed news: After the Ministry of Interior was ordered to preside over the design of the new political zone in the Ming Palace site in the capital, because it is currently the time when various agencies are returning to the capital, it is inevitable that some will prepare to build houses in the area. It has now been requested that the Executive Yuan issue orders to various agencies to temporarily refrain from building projects in the area before the plan is completed.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Destroys the Beining Railway - Passenger and Freight Cars Derailed Between Jinzhou-Yingkou and Yingkou-Jinxi</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, 19th] The Beining Railway between the Qianwei and Qiansuo stations in the Jinzhou-Yingkou section was again destroyed by the Communist army yesterday. As a result, the trains that had just resumed traffic after the flood subsided were once again blocked. Previously, traffic was blocked between Jinzhou and Yingkou, and traffic between Jinzhou and Shenyang had to be detoured due to flooding. It is unknown when traffic between Peiping and Shenyang will be resumed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 20th] The Communist army continues to destroy the Beining Railway from time to time.

<h3>Main Force of the National Army Arrives in Kaifeng - Situation in Eastern Henan Turns Calm - Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu Uses Japanese Prisoners of War in Combat</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanking, 20th] The situation on the Longhai Railway has slightly calmed down in recent days. It is reported that on the 17th and 18th, the Communist army attempted to harass Kaifeng, but failed because the main force of the National Army arrived. Kaifeng is now stable and safe. The Communist army in Zhuxian Town originally intended to attack Zhongmu from the northwest to cut off the railway between Zhengzhou and Bian, and to cut off the Pinghan Railway to the west. However, after a fierce attack by the National Army reinforcements, they could not withstand and fled towards Tongxu.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanking, 20th] Part of the Communist army in Southern Shandong is now concentrated in the Huaiyin and Suqian areas of Northern Jiangsu, numbering about 20,000. There is a possibility of attacking Xuzhou again or moving south. There are continued small clashes on the Zichuan-Boshan line in Shandong Province. Judging by the situation, the Communist army has an intention to launch a larger-scale attack in Shandong.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanking, 20th] The Henan Disaster Relief Delegation, consisting of Provincial Councilor Zhang Youshan, Councilors Lu Ru and Wang Jingshu, arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on the 20th. The delegation stated that Henan Province is suffering from both man-made and natural disasters, with 8.6 million refugees. Recently, it has been devastated by the Communist army. The 400-mile-long area between Kaifeng and Dangshan, where crops are the lifeline of the people, cannot be harvested as scheduled. The future impact is unimaginable. They specifically requested a petition to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of National Defense on the 22nd, demanding that the central government send troops to suppress the rebellion and implement emergency relief.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 20th] Military news: The Communist army has recently transferred more than 20,000 elite troops from Shandong and concentrated them in the Gaoyou, Suqian, and Huaiyin areas, preparing to launch a major offensive against the periphery of Xuzhou and Haian. It is reported that this Communist army is entirely equipped with old-fashioned weapons and has many field guns and many light and heavy machine guns. The gunners are all Japanese, apparently intending to carry out a large-scale offensive in Northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 20th] Military news: The Communist army's use of Japanese prisoners of war to attack the National Army has become increasingly common. Huang Kecheng, commander of the Communist 3rd Division, is currently leading more than 10,000 of his troops to Dongtai. They are all equipped with Japanese-style weapons and have more than 2,000 Japanese prisoners of war, as well as more than 20 light and heavy mortars, whose gunners are all operated by Japanese prisoners of war.</p>
<h3>Tens of Thousands of Communist Troops in Dalian - Have Landed in Yantai</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 20th] Military news: The Communist army has recently concentrated tens of thousands of troops with the latest equipment in Dalian and has been transporting them from Dalian to Yantai in Shandong for days. Some have landed in Yantai, and part of them are moving to the north of the Yantai-Jimo area, preparing to join forces with the Communist army of the National Government and capture Qingdao. Another part is advancing along the Yantai-Weifang highway, along the Jiaoji Railway line, attempting to cross the Jiaoji Railway and invade the Boshan area and capture Zibo. According to observers here, the current active mobilization of the Communist army in Shandong is a signal of launching a large-scale internal unrest.</p>
<h3>American Newspaper Discusses the Chinese Communist Party's Policy - The Communist Party Should Bear Major Responsibility for Prolonging the Internal Conflict</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 19th, United Press] The Sun published an editorial titled "The Major Assumption in China," which stated: President Chiang once said that China could only avoid internal conflict and establish a true democratic government if it was assumed that the Communist Party could abide by agreements. The newspaper reviewed the changes in the situation since last winter and commented on this major assumption in China, which has now become a reality, saying that at one time, many Americans believed that the Communist Party had an independent personality, that is, putting being Chinese first and being a Communist second, and using Marxism with a Moscow label to promote the permanent welfare of China in their homeland. However, Americans are now gradually recognizing that the Communist Party's policies are not formulated by Yan'an but by Moscow, and these policies are unacceptable to the Chinese government and many countries in the world.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 19th] At a time when China's internal conflict is escalating, the Sun, published in the afternoon in New York, commented: "Most Americans now believe that the Communist Party bears more responsibility for prolonging the internal conflict." The newspaper stated: "According to recent news from China, most Americans now doubt whether the Communist Party is willing to abide by the agreements it has reached with the National Government. Most Americans now feel that the Communist Party bears more responsibility for prolonging the internal conflict that is currently making China."</p>
<h3>Four Air Force Personnel Who Forced Their Plane to Land in Yan'an Escape and Return to the Capital - It is Claimed That Liu Shanben Weeps All Day Long</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanking, 20th] According to four Air Force personnel who recently escaped and returned, who had previously flown to Yan'an with Liu Shanben in a (B24) heavy bomber, Liu has been living in seclusion in his room and weeping all day long since arriving in Yan'an. It is said that when they first arrived in Yan'an, they still thought they had arrived in Xi'an and were detained by the Communist army. Only then did they realize that they had arrived in the Communist army's stronghold. Mao Zedong, Zhu De, and others initially treated them cordially and invited them to broadcast, proclaiming that they had "come for peace and anti-war" and falsely used their names to hold an enlarged memorial meeting for Air Force Day. Later, seeing that their attitude was tough, they became indifferent, and their treatment gradually deteriorated. They had twice confronted Zhu De, saying that since the Communist army advocates democracy, why are they detaining them and forcing them to join the Communist army? Zhu had no words to answer. The four were soon released, and the government is also negotiating with the Communist side for the release of the remaining personnel.</p>
<h3>The First Regiment of the Honorary Second Division Ordered to be Stationed in Suzhou</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Suzhou, 20th] The 145th Brigade stationed in Suzhou has been ordered to move elsewhere and has new tasks. The city defense work in this county has been assigned to the First Regiment of the 67th Division by order of the Ministry of National Defense. It has been completely transferred on the 19th under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Mao Lirang, the deputy commander of the regiment. According to reports, the regiment was originally assigned to the Honorary Second Division of General Dai Jian, the occupation army stationed in Japan. It has just been reorganized and is temporarily stationed at Wusongkou waiting for rotation to East, but the Army Headquarters of the Ministry of National Defense ordered them to be transferred to Suzhou first, as the security in Jiangnan needs to be particularly strengthened. The commander of the regiment, Major General Lin Guanhong, is now in Beijing asking for instructions.</p>
<h3>The Communist Army Plans to Launch a Full-Scale Offensive - The Northeast Presents a Situation Where a Storm is Brewing - The Government Still Hopes to Implement the Resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanking, 20th] The Communist army plans to launch a full-scale offensive, harassing different areas. It is reported that in the areas of Northern Jiangsu, Eastern Henan, Southern Shandong, and Northern Anhui, the Communist side is adopting a strategy of avoiding the strong and attacking the weak, attempting to tie down 500,000 National Army troops in those areas. In Eastern Henan, recently, due to the National Army's strong suppression, they are planning to change their direction of attack to other areas.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Peiping, 20th] The Northeast, which has been peaceful for a short time, is again facing a situation where a storm is brewing. The authorities here, who are concerned about the conflict, have been receiving reports of frequent movements of the Communist army in recent days, indicating that there will be large-scale actions. Today, the evening newspaper here carried a Shenyang dispatch stating that after Du Yuming returned from directing exercises in various places, many military vehicles were seen heading north through Shenyang. The sudden arrival and hasty departure of Li Lisan in Shenyang is believed by the government authorities to be an observation of the situation. There have been battles in the Xingcheng and Suizhong areas, and there have also been contacts in Hailongdong. Gunfire can be heard in the city.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tianjin, 20th] The North China Office of the International Propaganda Department of the Central Propaganda Department stated that the Communist army is actively preparing for war along the Songhua River and the Changchun-Harbin Railway in the Northeast. A large number of Communist reinforcements have arrived in Taolai, including heavy artillery units. The Communist army has built strong defensive lines along the Chang-Harbin Railway.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanking, 20th] After the Chinese Communist Party issued a signal of full-scale chaos, all parties expressed their heartache. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically visited Minister Bai of the Ministry of National Defense to inquire about his views on this matter. Bai replied that he was not surprised at all by this matter, because the Communist Party has not fulfilled any of the agreements regarding political consultation, military consultation, and transportation consultation in the past negotiations. Recently, the government still hopes that it will fulfill them, but the Chinese Communist Party has intensified its efforts, launching offensives everywhere in Northern Jiangsu, Datong, Taiyuan, Xuzhou, and along the Longhai Railway. The reporter was concerned about the safety of Kaifeng, and Minister Bai replied: "Mr. Milks, a special correspondent from the United Press in Beijing, also raised the same question yesterday. I told him that Kaifeng is stable; and to answer the safety of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, I can absolutely take responsibility." Bai concluded by saying: "We have been adhering to the central government's consistent policy, hoping for peace and a political solution. The Communist Party has recently launched offensives everywhere, but we believe that military force alone cannot solve the problem, and that neither national nor world problems can be solved by military force. The Communist Party believes in military force, but we are still willing to negotiate peace with them."</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jiangdu, 20th] After the Communist Party openly ordered the launch of a war, the people of Northern Jiangsu expressed their greatest indignation upon hearing the news, but they did not show surprise, because the Communist army's violation of the agreement and launching of the war has already existed in fact. This is only a concretization of their actions. The reporter specifically visited Huang Baitao, commander of the reorganized 25th Division of the National Army stationed in Yangzhou, to inquire about his thoughts. According to him, the Communist Party's action is self-defeating to the people of the country. After eight years of war, the people are eager for peace, stability, recuperation, and rehabilitation. The government has also repeatedly tolerated and hoped to solve the problem through political means. However, the Communist Party is obsessed and now openly wants to seize power by force, attempting to test the conspiracy of the ambitious. It is truly the misfortune of the Chinese people, and the restoration and construction of China may be delayed by another fifty years. Huang continued to say that the situation in Northern Jiangsu is becoming clear, and the Communist army will inevitably gather its forces in this area near the capital. However, the National Army is strong and heavily guarded. If they invade, they will suffer heavy blows.</p>
<h3>Liang Shuming and Zhou Xinmin Left Kunming for Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Investigation of the Li-Wen Case Completed</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kunming, 19th] Liang Shuming and Zhou Xinmin of the Democratic League came to Kunming from Chongqing on the 6th to independently investigate the Li-Wen case on behalf of the Democratic League. It is heard that they have obtained results and are scheduled to leave Kunming for Beijing on the 20th.</p>
<h3>Observing the Political Situation at Lushan</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Xie Baozhu</p>
<p>The nation's attention on Kuling began on the day Chairman Chiang arrived (July 14th). At that time, it gave people a surge of excitement, especially with Ambassador Stuart's subsequent ascents to the mountain, which caused everyone to pay even closer attention, and the sensitive reporters, of course, became even more nervous.</p>
<p>However, from July 14th to the present, the development of the situation, coupled with the comings and goings of dignitaries, reached a level of tension that the reporters did not expect when they climbed the mountain. As a result, Kuling leaped from being the center of conversation for the nation to a place watched by the people of the whole world.</p>
<p>The Tense Prelude</p>
<p>The tense prelude unfolded with the Anping Incident. This happened on July 29th, but the news spread in the clouds and mists of Lushan on August 1st. Thereupon, from the authorities above to those discussing national affairs below, everyone believed that the case had reached a critical stage. If similar incidents could not be guaranteed to not occur again, and if the truth of the case could not be thoroughly investigated and then reasonably resolved, the past enthusiasm of the American people for China would suffer an inestimable impact. At the same time, the peace negotiations that Special Envoy Marshall had been working hard to achieve would inevitably be affected. During those days, not only did Ambassador Stuart and Chairman Chiang discuss this matter several times, but also Admiral Cooke, Commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, came to the mountain. On one hand, it was to escape the summer heat, and on the other hand, it seemed specifically for this matter. At the beginning of the incident, the Americans could not determine who was responsible. After several important American officials successively received reports on the mountain, it was proven that the incident was undoubtedly committed by the Communist army. At this time, everyone felt a little uneasy, coupled with the reaction from American public opinion, there was deep fear that the situation would expand even further. Unanimously, everyone fixed their eyes on Marshall and the Ambassador, waiting to see their reaction. Although the American Ambassador adopted a calm and objective attitude towards this matter, it was, after all, not a small case. Therefore, when Marshall ascended the mountain for the third time, observers and reporters alike unanimously asserted that Marshall's visit was entirely for the "Anping Incident."</p>
<p>When Marshall descended the mountain for the second time, everyone thought it was to continue exchanging views with Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Chinese Communist Party. At the same time, some overly sensitive people even speculated that the tripartite meeting might be reopened in Kuling. Little did they know that the facts were very different from what people expected. Marshall's hurried descent was originally because of the "Anping Incident."</p>
<p>In fact, it is really no wonder that people are so nervous. The conversations about these major situations can never get the slightest hint to outsiders. However, because of the seriousness of the situation, to rush ahead with reporting, we must make a "guess," and this time the result was another failure. Marshall's three ascents to the mountain were not solely for the "Anping Incident," but mainly about the "overall peace problem."</p>
<p>After the layer of haze that the "Anping Incident" cast on the peace talks was eliminated by the wise decisions and foresight of Chairman Chiang, Marshall, and Ambassador Stuart, the air in Kuling also seemed like a vast expanse of clouds and mist, which scattered in an instant, revealing a scene of lush greenery. Those few days were filled with sighs and anxieties about the tragic situation of the disaster victims in northern Jiangsu, and gnashing of teeth about the outrageous act of the Communist army breaching the dikes in northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>Marshall's and Stuart's Statement</p>
<p>Following this was the announcement of Marshall's and Stuart's statement. For a time, it seemed to make people feel that the situation was more ominous than auspicious, just as they had said to reporters in Nanjing before issuing the statement: "The current situation in China is very bleak." Most people thought, "Now there is hope."</p>
<p>However, the two peace envoys did not want to be discouraged by this. On the 12th, the Ambassador said to a reporter from the Central News Agency in Nanjing, "We are now awaiting the progress of the negotiations. I will not give up hope until we believe that we can do no more." His words were fulfilled. Indeed, the road ahead is rugged, with numerous obstacles, but they still have to muster their spirits, summon their courage, and move forward, seeking peace for China.</p>
<p>However, on "August 13th," the broadcast from Yan'an gave the two old men a very serious blow. On the one hand, we resent the Communist Party's unreasonableness, and on the other hand, we offer the two envoys doubled respect, and at the same time tell them that we are always supporting them, acting as their backing, because "we need peace."</p>
<p>The Chairman's Proclamation</p>
<p>Before and after Chairman Chiang's proclamation on "August 14th" spread on this high mountain, the conversations on the mountain, the reporters' inquiries, and the government commissioners' statements were all related to this. But the conclusion was the same: today, no one desires peace more than the National Government, and today, no one struggles for peace and experiences difficulties more than the National Government. However, what can now be told to the people of the country is that the door to peace is still wide open. As long as the Communist Party abandons its ambition to control the fate of the nation with a minority party, then peaceful unification and democratic construction will surely achieve their final goal. Not only do our compatriots cherish and support this proclamation, but also public opinion from all foreign countries unanimously agrees with its implementation of the six guiding principles and is willing to continue to assist the Central Government.</p>
<p>This proclamation, on the other hand, can also be used as a basis for three comparisons: First, the Communist Party has no sincerity in peace negotiations, its attitude is tough, and its demands are unreasonable; while the Chairman's proclamation is sincere and gentle, expressing an open and upright spirit. Second, the Yan'an broadcast is clearly undermining Marshall's and Stuart's mediation, rejecting their assistance in striving for peace; while the "proclamation" is the opposite, it explicitly requests Marshall and Stuart to continue to seek stability and alleviate suffering for all the compatriots of China, and at the same time realistically expresses that the government still holds hope for the future of peace. Third, the content of the "August 14th" proclamation is not actually based on Marshall's and Stuart's statement, but the difficulties mentioned in the proclamation are exactly the same as the difficulties mentioned in Marshall's and Stuart's statement, which shows that the views of all parties are consistent. In fact, this difficulty is also very simple and not difficult to solve. The government's highest hope is to obtain the cooperation of the Communist Party and implement the three major agreements reached since January of this year, and the minimum requirement is for the Communist Party to withdraw from areas that threaten peace and hinder transportation, and to restore transportation.</p>

<h3>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Pan Xulun Discusses: Considering Increasing Import Taxes; Jiangsu Provincial Chairman Urges Businessmen Not to Increase Prices Rashly</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Pan Xulun stated today: The export promotion plan was drafted by the Economic Committee of the Executive Yuan. Regarding this matter, the government will begin negotiations with the U.S. government. If this measure is successful, it will be enough to save China's economic crisis. On the other hand: Increasing import taxes on foreign goods is under consideration.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 20th] The Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, fearing that prices might fluctuate due to the adjustment of the exchange rate, specially convened representatives of the province's business community to make a statement: Briefly, this adjustment of the exchange rate is an appropriate measure to balance imports and exports, support production, stabilize prices, and promote the national economy. The business communities in Jiangsu Province should understand the government's intentions, cooperate and assist, and ensure that market prices do not increase rashly as a result. The general public should especially not misunderstand the exchange rate adjustment as a military or currency issue. It should be known that this measure is precisely to achieve a reasonable harmonization of domestic and foreign currencies, so that only in this way can domestic industry and commerce be protected and the current economic crisis be resolved.</p>
<h3>Optimistic Prospects for the Silk Industry</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 20th] After the exchange rate adjustment, the price of gold in Hangzhou did not rise significantly, and today it is still hovering around 240,000. Market prices in all industries are agitated and unstable, especially the silk industry, which has risen the fastest. Rice prices have not changed much, but the shortage of japonica rice has already caused a black market. Moreover, the silk and tea industries, which were previously in a dying state, are said by relevant people to have optimistic prospects. The exchange rate adjustment for exports will allow the price of raw silk to increase to 3.6 to 3.8 million, allowing manufacturers to break even. Although the tea industry is still bleak, people are optimistic, and the market is slightly more active than before.</p>
<h3>Capital Controls Grain Prices</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] In order to prevent price increases in goods unrelated to foreign exchange due to the exchange rate adjustment, the municipal government has heard that it will take some measures. The Social Affairs Bureau has been ordered to strictly control grain prices to prevent manipulation of rice and silkworm cocoons. Street stalls are also subject to control to avoid competition with department stores.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 20th] Although Finance Minister Yu Hongjun clearly stated that the adjustment of the foreign exchange rate should not affect domestic prices, merchants in Nanjing do not share this view. Most of the prices in store windows have already been changed, with some increasing by 50%, and some even doubling. Restaurant prices have also been revised in many cases.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Export Goods Increase in Price</h3>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, 20th] After the announcement of the new exchange rate, the prices of various export goods here, such as tung oil, cinnamon, and galls, have increased by about 40%, while the prices of imported goods have increased by 20%. Business people generally believe that after prices obtain a new standard, the prices of foreign goods will still be lower than those of domestic goods. At the same time, the exchange rate has increased the cost of living.</p>
<h3>Fluctuations in Gold Prices in Wuhan</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Hankou, 20th] Since the announcement of the new exchange rate here, the financial market has suddenly fluctuated.

It has also been decided that no prices will be listed temporarily starting today.</p>

<h3>Authorities Allocate 10 Billion Yuan to Organize the Central Cooperative Treasury to Strive to Solve Rural Economic Difficulties</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] In order to attach importance to the development of the agricultural economy, Chairman Chiang previously summoned Chen Guofu, Chairman of the China Farmers Bank, Li Shuming, General Manager, and Shou Miancheng, Director of the National Cooperative Administration, to Kuling to inquire about and give instructions on agricultural cooperation and land issues.

<h3>Takashi Sakai Publicly Tried Again; His Crimes are Too Numerous to Count; Trial Ends, Sentence to be Pronounced on the 27th</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Japanese war criminal Takashi Sakai was publicly tried again by the War Crimes Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense at the Lizhi Society at 3:00 PM on the 20th. The defendant had previously been tried by the War Crimes Military Tribunal of the Army Headquarters, and a date for sentencing had long been set. However, because the evidence of the war criminal's crimes in Hong Kong was insufficient, the case files were repeatedly investigated, and finally the defendant was retried on the 20th. Mrs. Zou Lu and her daughter-in-law were invited to testify. The audience was extremely crowded. The trial was still presided over by Judge Shi Meiyu. The indictment was read out first, and then the witnesses reported their eyewitness accounts separately. The defendant initially stood to listen to the trial, but was later allowed to sit due to the doctor's explanation of his condition. His attitude was slightly calmer and more mournful than the previous time. The trial ended at 8:00 PM, and Judge Shi announced that the sentence would be pronounced at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 27th. Takashi Sakai was taken back into custody. The following are some of his crimes: (1) The defendant was responsible for general planning and conspiracy before the war; (2) Crimes of destroying peace in North China; (3) During the undeclared war, the defendant led troops to attack Hong Kong and massacred and raped our civilians, and should be held liable for crimes against humanity. Then, witness Mrs. Zou Lu reported the details of how her son was killed by Takashi Sakai. When she stood up to speak and testify, the audience all felt the pain in their hearts. Later, someone proved that Takashi Sakai had plotted to assassinate General Ma Zhanshan and Tianjin reporter Zhu Xiaofu. Takashi Sakai denied everything, claiming that his acts of aggression were in obedience to his government's orders, and that as a soldier, he should obey orders, so all responsibility should be borne by the government. Finally, he strongly stated that he was willing to go to Tokyo to confront Tanaka, but he was immediately refuted by the presiding judge. At that time, the audience all wished to see him shot immediately to satisfy the anger of the people. However, with this kind of evidence of various crimes, there is no doubt that he will be sentenced to death.</p>

<h3>Viewing the Political Situation from Lushan: Continued from First Edition</h3>
<p>曾琦's Ascent: Precisely under this delicate circumstance, 曾琦, a leader of the Youth Party, arrived at the mountain. He expressed his agreement with the eleventh-day editorial in the Chung Hua Shih Pao, which suggested "convening a national conference that can truly represent national public opinion." Meanwhile, based on clues gleaned from various reporters, the government also seemed to be considering inviting university presidents and speakers of provincial and municipal councils to Guling for an informal discussion to gather opinions from various sectors. As a result, all of Guling was abuzz. For days, reporters scurried about, sweating profusely even in the autumn-like mountain air, all for this major event. However, until today, no conclusion has been reached. Some believe it is highly likely, others think it will be difficult to accomplish, some acknowledge it is indeed happening, and others vehemently deny it. In the end, it has become a complete mess, with rumors flying everywhere. The true nature of this discussion may have been misunderstood. Ultimately, the reporters have become confused. But some explain it this way: perhaps the Chairman is gradually summoning people from all sides to the mountain for discussions, which could be the ongoing work. But regardless of whether this is actually happening or not, the fact that such an issue, worthy of the nation's attention, has arisen is nothing more than an expression of the people's desire, in this extremely distressing stage, to seek a good way to break the deadlock, and is also a psychological reaction.</p>
<p>Marshal Ma's Reappearance: Just as everyone had to temporarily relax their uncertain expectations for the discussion, Marshal Ma hastily ascended Lushan for the fourth time. Undoubtedly, no one dared to relax their close attention to Marshal Ma's visit, especially with President Song arriving on the mountain at the same time, constantly shuttling back and forth between the Chairman's and Marshal Ma's residences on the green bridge, looking so busy, it was impossible not to feel nervous. Moreover, Marshal Ma has clearly told us that this is his most tense visit to Mount Kuanglu, even unable to eat in peace. No wonder onlookers subconsciously felt: "The current situation has indeed reached a critical juncture!" Unfortunately, the reporters, and even senior government officials, could not obtain the slightest information about the content of the Chairman's and Marshal Ma's talks. Thus, everyone inevitably engaged in some unofficial speculation: "Perhaps they may continue to explore a mutually concessive solution to break the current deadlock... Perhaps... But this conversation must make a final decision, perhaps a problem is coming!". But everything remains a "mystery"!</p>
<p>The Plight of Reporters: Recently, the comings and goings of dignitaries in Guling seem quite different from two weeks ago. Before, one came every few days, but these days, several come in one day. Sensitive and pitiful reporters have to rack their brains again, are they here to participate in the discussion? For...? In fact, some are indeed here solely to report on the state of governance to the Chairman. But the previous period was the "President" and elder statesmen's time to come up the mountain, and recently it is the "Ministers" time, which seems to be somewhat meaningful.</p>
<p>For these past two weeks or so, the most miserable, and sometimes miserably without reason, have been the news reporters. Whether launching a "war of nerves," implementing a "war of nerves," or "returning in triumph," or "retreating in defeat," all the way to "how to write the news just right," then to "shouting hoarsely," and finally feeling relieved after finishing the phone call, they have exhausted countless efforts and wracked their brains, trying to extract a thread from a pile of tangled hemp, and attempting to find some real state of affairs from the constantly changing situation.</p>
<p>What will be the future political goals? I dare not guess wildly, but I cannot help but prepare in my mind. Perhaps it will be deciding how to make the final move on the chessboard! Perhaps it will be discussing how to create a perfect and feasible charter, in preparation for submitting it to the National Assembly for discussion in the future, and then formulating a constitution, so that the problem of expanding the foundation of the government can be satisfactorily resolved.</p>
<p>Watching the political situation in Guling is no different from watching the clouds and mists of Mount Lushan: one moment one cannot see one's own fingers, the next moment the mountains are clear and the waters are beautiful, and the eyes are suddenly brightened. The constant changes are truly unpredictable. (The End)</p>

<p>Anhui Land Tax Reduction</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Correspondent] During the Anti-Japanese War, Anhui Province suffered greatly. After the victory, the Communist army caused disturbances, and society was unstable. Furthermore, locust plagues and floods came one after another, leading to the desolation of people's livelihoods and widespread cries of sorrow. The burden of taxation was unbearable. The total amount of land tax in the province this year was originally 13 million yuan. Recently, Chen Zifeng, a National Assembly representative from Anhui, requested the Ministry of Food to reduce it to 11 million yuan, with each yuan requiring a three-borrow-one addition, totaling four *dou* per yuan, to be paid in market scale, with no responsibility for transportation. Remote counties may use legal tender to offset the price. The extent of military disasters and locust plagues in all counties can be truthfully reported to facilitate reduction.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Summary of the Past Year of KMT-CPC Negotiations</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 19th (United Press) – According to a broadcast from Zhangjiakou Radio, Yan'an has not only issued a mobilization order, but has also openly declared the existence of a state of war. Although the CPC delegation in Nanjing claims to have no knowledge of this, as evidenced by the intensified siege of Datong and the major battles in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, it has become a well-known fact that the CPC intends to expand its territory and seize power by force. Although the government has made painstaking efforts and still hopes that political issues can be resolved peacefully, and Marshal Ma and Ambassador Stuart have returned to Nanjing one after another yesterday to mediate again in order to save the final crisis, looking ahead to the future development of the domestic political situation, due to the CPC's long-standing planning and self-learning, it has become a situation of riding a tiger today, and it is difficult to expect it to rein in at the precipice, I am afraid there is only one in a thousand chances.</p>
<p>Thinking back to this day a year ago, the Japanese invaders had just surrendered unconditionally, and the whole country celebrated wildly. Bright and beautiful ideals flashed before the eyes of every person, but now there is an atmosphere of near disillusionment!</p>
<p>When the Japanese invaders surrendered, President Chiang saw the extraordinary telegram from Zhu De, the military leader of the Communist Party, and deeply knew the seriousness of the Communist Party issue. If a solution could not be found as soon as possible, the consequences would be endless. He specifically sent three telegrams inviting the Communist Party leader Mao Zedong to Chongqing to meet and discuss the great plan of peaceful nation-building. Mao arrived in Chongqing on August 28th last year and met with President Chiang many times. The talks ended on October 10th. Although no major achievements were made, a common principle was reached, that is: both the KMT and the CPC will "cooperate in the long term under the leadership of President Chiang, resolutely avoid civil war, build an independent, free and prosperous new China, and thoroughly implement the Three Principles of the People." Both sides also agreed that "the political democratization, nationalization of the military, and equality and legality of parties advocated by President Chiang are the path to achieving peaceful nation-building and freedom." This common principle, found in the "Minutes of the Double Tenth Negotiations," should have been the basis for the two sides to continue negotiations. Unfortunately, the CPC was unwilling to expand the basis of this peace negotiation, but used its military advantages to "compete for surrender" with the government everywhere, not only hindering the National Army from entering Rehe, but also agitating in the areas of northern Jiangsu and Shandong, taking the opportunity to replenish its military strength and consolidate its territory. Later, because it could not withstand the unanimous condemnation of the people of the country, the CPC began to issue orders to stop the conflict with the government at the same time. At the same time, it held a Political Consultative Conference in Chongqing with the government, various parties, and social elites to discuss in detail five issues: (1) the program for peaceful nation-building, (2) the organization of the government, (3) military issues, (4) the National Assembly, and (5) the draft constitution. After more than 20 days of debate, it finally completed a grand charter for China's peaceful nation-building. There was simultaneous realization of the hope for the nationalization of the military and political democratization, making all parts of the country full of a peaceful and bright atmosphere. Subsequently, the basic plan for military reorganization and the unification and compilation of the CPC forces into the National Army was also signed. The general public believed that the realization of the nationalization of the military was even more certain.</p>
<p>But after the people celebrated the success of the PCC, the people's hope vanished again because of the Communist Party's harassment everywhere. The CPC not only fought for cities and territories in Rehe, Liaoning, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, as well as northern Anhui and northern Jiangsu, but also deliberately destroyed the national railway and highway transportation in order to hinder the government's acceptance and completion of demobilization work. By the end of February, the CPC's ambition had become even more intensified, and it created a situation of local separatism in the Northeast under the guise of the Northeast Allied Forces. Coupled with the long-standing unresolved issue of the withdrawal of Soviet troops, the issue became even more delicate and complex, making our friendly nations feel uneasy about the seriousness of China's internal affairs. By early April, the Soviet Union completely withdrew from the country, and the CPC forces took advantage of the weakness of the National Army and successively occupied Changchun and Harbin, with a tendency to sweep across the entire Northeast. At the same time, they destroyed the Beining Road and hindered the opening of traffic between Peiping and Shenyang, causing the situation in the Northeast to fall into a more chaotic state. Although Special Envoy Marshall tried his best to mediate and repeatedly asked the CPC to "withdraw from Changchun and hand over the defense to the Central Army so that he could discuss other issues," the CPC was unwilling to accept it. The Northeast was originally not within the scope of military mediation, but the government endured for the sake of the country and recognized the mediation, as long as it did not hinder the National Army's work of accepting sovereignty. Is it not the most obvious fact that the CPC's siege of Changchun and long-term occupation without withdrawal is a breach of contract and a violation of the agreement? The CPC caused the conflict in the Northeast, and the war has escalated day by day. The responsibility lies with whom? No need to say more.</p>
<p>However, Chinese and foreign people only hoped for an early end to the conflict in the Northeast, and no longer questioned right and wrong. President Chiang also, for the sake of the future of peaceful nation-building, did not hesitate to compromise and issued a ceasefire order in the Northeast on June 6, limiting the negotiations to 15 days to restore traffic and implement the plan for military demobilization and reorganization and unification. However, on the last day, no results were achieved. President Chiang again ordered an extension of eight days. The CPC should value this last opportunity. But in the last eight days, the Communist Party still played its most brilliant trick, dragging out the negotiations and failing to reach a conclusion. It left Marshal Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, who were enthusiastically working for peace, helpless and had to temporarily suspend their mediation work.</p>
<p>In the simple narrative above, it can be seen that in the eyes of the people, the CPC should be held responsible for the outbreak of war in our country. In the process of negotiation, the CPC still talked eloquently about peace and sang the praises of "unconditional ceasefire," but secretly and stealthily tried to cover up the eyes and ears of the world with one hand. When American soldiers were kidnapped, American soldiers were attacked, and Yan'an broadcast anti-American propaganda, we predicted that the CPC had reached the point of revealing its true colors. Today, the CPC has simply torn off its mask and openly announced a mobilization order and the existence of a state of war. In the eyes of the Chinese people, who have seen through the CPC's style, there is nothing strange about it. What is surprising is that the CPC's sinister and vicious practices are derived from something, and there are still some friends who do not understand the truth about China, as well as muddle-headed and careless "neutralists," who are deceived by the CPC and dream that the CPC may one day unconditionally cease fire!</p>
<p>As for the government, it has always been in a passive position militarily. What it insists on is only that the CPC stop its military offensives, stop destroying traffic, and implement the reorganization and unification of the military. President Chiang has always adhered to the policy of peaceful unification, enduring for the sake of the country and striving to achieve a political solution to domestic problems. After the close of the PCC, the government was indeed determined to achieve political democratization and hoped that the National Assembly would be convened on May 5 to formulate a constitution and get on the right track of constitutional government. However, the CPC first argued over the number of representatives and finally refused to attend, so the National Assembly had to be postponed. It was not until July 3 that the Supreme National Defense Council decided to convene the National Assembly on November 12 of this year and reaffirmed that the PCC resolutions would continue to be valid. President Chiang recently announced to the people of the country that the government will convene the National Assembly as scheduled, abide by the PCC resolutions, and expand the foundation of the government, and still adopt political means to resolve internal disputes. Now that the government has adopted the initiative of "doing its best," it is hoped that it will make a real start by eliminating corruption, rectifying politics, improving administrative efficiency, and relieving the suffering of the people, and then the direction of the people's hearts will be clearly visible.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, the spread of the Communist Party in China is partly a result of political measures that drive the fish into the depths, not because the Communist Party can win the support of the people. But since the Communist Party dug its own grave in the Shandong and Northern Jiangsu areas, it can also be said that the Communist Party has done the government a great favor. As long as the government takes good care of itself, it will be extremely easy to win back people's hearts today! We have always believed that a political solution does not only refer to negotiations with the CPC. The principle of "three parts military, seven parts politics" that President Chiang proclaimed that year is still applicable to resolving the current domestic political problems. This is the way out for a political solution to the China problem, and it is also the only hope our common people have for the government!</p>

<h3>The United States and Yugoslav Troops in a State of Quasi-War</h3>
<p>Troops from both sides have repeatedly clashed in the Trieste port occupation zone; the United States has twice sent strongly worded notes to Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Combined News] The port of Trieste, on the border between Italy and Yugoslavia, had become a hotly debated issue at the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference. Eventually, it was temporarily placed under international co-administration by mutual agreement, with British, American, and Yugoslav troops stationed there, each with its own defense zone. However, in the past two months, small-scale conflicts have occurred repeatedly between the two sides, and they have exchanged protest notes. According to a United Press dispatch from Washington, on the 19th, the United States abruptly exposed its relationship with Yugoslavia, revealing that the American troops stationed in Trieste were in a state of quasi-war with the Yugoslav troops. The State Department today released two notes to Yugoslavia, which were worded so severely as to be unprecedented. The notes accuse the Yugoslav troops of illegally entering the American or British occupation zones and attacking American troops without cause on June 19th and 30th, and again on July 12th and 13th, and of engaging in a bloody battle on June 19th. The notes also list nine instances of provocative behavior by Yugoslavia against the military government, and even distort the facts to express dissatisfaction with the military government. The Yugoslav government seems to be attempting to overthrow the United Nations military government in Trieste, create economic conflict, incite pro-Yugoslav residents, and intimidate pro-Italian residents. Although the notes do not mention the incident of an American plane being intercepted by Yugoslavia between Austria and Italy, officials here are closely investigating the situation at the time and privately expressing extreme indignation. High-ranking American diplomatic officials believe that the time has come for the Western United Nations to economically strike against Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia has close ties with the Soviet Union and has received a great deal of assistance from the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). It is uncertain whether this situation can be maintained without leading to large-scale open conflict. Senior officials here also doubt whether the Soviet Union would be willing to support any extreme actions by Yugoslav President Tito that could involve direct conflict between East and West. Meanwhile, according to a Reuters dispatch from London on the 20th, the British government also simultaneously published two notes to Yugoslavia, dated May 20th and August 14th, which used the strongest possible language to refute the Yugoslav official account of the conflict between the Allied military government and Yugoslav officials on the Italian-Yugoslav border. Authoritative sources say that the British government believes that Yugoslavia's publication of conflict situations that do not conform to the facts is intended to discredit the Allied military government in the area in the eyes of the world, with the ultimate aim of influencing the Paris Peace Conference's decision on the Trieste region. Britain believes that if a free zone is established in the port of Trieste under the supervision of the United Nations, it must have genuine independence. The most important development in this regard is the holding of the first election. This raises the question of whether the Allied military government should supervise it. Therefore, the performance of the military government has a significant impact on the decisions of the peace conference. Britain believes that Yugoslavia is bound to oppose the supervision of the first election by the Allied military government, and therefore does not hesitate to engage in malicious propaganda to damage the reputation of the military government.</p>
<h3>The Dardanelles Question</h3>
<p>The United States has issued a reply to the Soviet Union, agreeing to amend the treaty but opposing a Soviet-Turkish joint defense; the stances of Britain and France are generally the same as those of the United States.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Combined News] Regarding the Turkish Dardanelles Strait issue, according to a United Press dispatch from Washington, the U.S. government delivered a note to Soviet Embassy Counselor Olyokov on the 20th, stating the U.S. position on the Dardanelles. The U.S. Embassy in Turkey also simultaneously conveyed the U.S. government's position to the Turkish government. According to a United Press dispatch from Washington, on the 19th, the U.S. State Department announced that the United States had drafted a note to the Soviet Union, advocating that the United Nations jointly participate in the revision of the Montreux Convention and opposing the Soviet Union's viewpoint. The drafting of this note was carried out by President Truman at a meeting convened at the White House, attended by Secretary of State Byrnes, Secretary of War Patterson, Secretary of the Navy Forrestal, and several high-ranking generals from the Army and Navy.</p>
<p>The Note's Contents Encompass Four Points</p>
<p>The U.S. note is widely believed to include the following points: (1) The United States is prepared to participate in any discussions regarding the revision of the Montreux Convention; (2) The United States believes that any organization established for the Strait issue should be related to the United Nations, as the Montreux Convention was originally established under the former League of Nations to ensure Turkey's neutrality; (3) The United States opposes the view that the Dardanelles is only a matter concerning the Black Sea countries; (4) The United States opposes the Soviet Union's view that the defense of the Strait is solely a matter for the Soviet Union and Turkey. It is reported that the note has been prepared and is currently being studied by several senior officials at the State Department. Because this matter is extremely important, it must be carefully studied before being sent out.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from London, Britain will send a note to the Soviet Union regarding the revision of the Montreux Treaty within 48 hours, and it is expected to adopt a similar stance. On the one hand, the British Ambassador to Turkey delivered a note to the Turkish Foreign Ministry on the 20th, explaining Britain's views on the Strait issue. Although the content of the note has not been disclosed, Turkish officials have expressed great satisfaction, indicating that it supports Turkey's position. As for France, according to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Paris on the 19th, the French government has instructed its ambassadors to Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Turkey to separately notify each country of France's position on the Dardanelles Strait issue. According to this instruction, which was issued last week, the French government is prepared to participate in the revision of the Montreux Convention, but it should be revised in accordance with the provisions of the original agreement.</p>
<h3>Six British Warships Arrive in Basra</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 19th] The Soviet news agency quoted a Tehran newspaper as saying that on the 11th and 12th of this month, a British cruiser and five troop transport ships arrived in Basra, and that British troops were active in the Iranian border area. The highway on the east bank of the Shatt al-Arab, opposite Basra, is being paved with asphalt for military use.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Notifies Iran to Retrieve Wartime Ships</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tehran, 19th] The Soviet Embassy here today notified the Iranian government to send personnel to retrieve the Iranian naval ships used by the Soviet Navy in the Caspian Sea during the war on August 30th. The number of ships was not disclosed.</p>
<h3>Portugal Suggests a Military Alliance to the United States</h3>
<p>Azores Islands Offered for American Use as an Exchange Condition</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lisbon, 19th] According to well-informed sources, Portugal has suggested to the United States that the two countries establish a military alliance. Portugal plans to grant the United States certain facilities on the Azores Islands for a period of 99 years as an exchange condition. This suggestion was conveyed to the government by the U.S. Ambassador to Portugal, and secret negotiations have been conducted since then. They had not concluded by the time the 12th U.S. Air Force squadron arrived in Portugal.</p>
<h3>Afghanistan's Membership Application Approved by the United Nations</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 20th] The United Nations Membership Credentials Committee held its 13th meeting to review the membership applications of nine countries. After five and a half hours of discussion, it reached a partial agreement and prepared to submit a report to the Security Council. During the meeting, Britain once again supported Transjordan, Poland enthusiastically supported Sweden, and Mexico strongly supported Iceland. In addition to the above three countries, the countries applying for membership also included Albania, Outer Mongolia, Siam, Afghanistan, Ireland, and Portugal. Among them, only Afghanistan's application has been fully approved by the committee. The Security Council must decide whether or not to admit new member states before August 29th.</p>
<h3>British Pacific Fleet Commander Arrives in Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Yokohama, 20th] Vice Admiral Power, Commander of the British Pacific Fleet, arrived here today aboard the flagship Belfast. He will proceed to Tokyo to meet with British diplomats and generals of the U.S. Eighth Army, and plans to visit the British occupation forces headquarters in Kure in early September.</p>
<h3>A 131-Year-Old Man, Smoking a College Cigar, Wearing a Confederate Uniform, Claims to Be the Son of the Late President Monroe</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 20th] James Monroe, the fifth President of the United States, was a writer and the founder of the famous Monroe Doctrine (which prohibits European interference in American affairs). The world knows that he had no sons. However, news published in New York newspapers today stated that a Major James Monroe has arrived in New York, claiming not only to have been born in 1815 (making him 131 years old to date), but also to be the son of President Monroe, leading many to doubt the claim. According to the entry on Monroe in the Encyclopedia Britannica, the late President only had two daughters, no sons. This Major Monroe is unusually alert, smoking a long college cigar, wearing clothes from the Confederate era, and was discovered in Florida by an advertising agent for physical training expert Macfadden. He was immediately flown to New York and made a public appearance before the press. Although his origins are questionable, his advanced age is not, as American magazines already reported his 103rd birthday as a marvel 28 years ago. According to Major Monroe, he has married three wives, all of whom have passed away, and has eleven children. Last year, he fell in love again and almost married for the fourth time. People here generally say that regardless of his origins, his public appearance before the press is a form of advertising full of gimmicks.</p>
<h3>Our Representative Proposes International Co-Administration of Italian Territories at the Peace Conference; Draft Amendment Requests Due by Midnight Yesterday; General Assembly Rescheduled for Today; Bevin to Preside</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Combined News] According to United Press, the plenary session, originally scheduled for today to hear the opinions of Egypt, Mexico, Cuba, Albania, and Austria, had to be postponed to Wednesday because the Albanian delegation failed to arrive in time. Foreign Secretary Bevin is expected to serve as the rotating chairman. According to Paris Radio, Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber arrived in Paris on the 20th and will attend the plenary session of the peace conference tomorrow to present his views. His presentation will focus on the issue of the people in the southern Tyrol region. Gruber specifically pointed out that Austria has repeatedly submitted memoranda to the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers and the 21-nation peace conference regarding the German people of Tyrol. Austria has no desire to pursue a policy of territorial expansion, but asks the peace conference to find a just and satisfactory solution.</p>
<p>The Italian Committee met today and, after two hours of discussion, agreed to Vishinsky's suggestion to first consider the preamble to the Italian peace treaty and the memoranda submitted by the Italian delegation. The meeting then made no progress because all practical work had to wait until the parties submitted amendments before the midnight deadline today. During the meeting, the representatives of Belgium and the Netherlands criticized the Italian delegation's claim that Italy had not declared war on four of the 20 member states of the Italian Committee. According to Agence France-Presse, Paris, China was the first to submit an amendment to the Italian peace treaty to the conference secretariat for discussion by the various subcommittees of the peace treaty. The amendment proposed by the Chinese delegation to the Italian Political and Territorial Committee advocated that the former Italian colonies be placed under international administration. This proposal had been made by the Chinese representative at the plenary session of the peace conference, but was opposed by France. Sources in the conference lounge said that as of now, only China, Yugoslavia, and the Netherlands have submitted amendments to the Italian peace treaty.</p>
<p>Italy Submits Memorandum Requesting Amendment of Preamble</p>
<p>Italy requested that the preamble to the draft treaty refer to "certain" United Nations, rather than all United Nations, in any war, and specifically stipulate that the Italian people were "led into" the war by the Fascist regime. The Yugoslav representative criticized the spirit of the Italian amendment, which was to eliminate Italy's war responsibility and make it unrelated to the current regime, which was completely unacceptable. According to Paris Radio, the memorandum sent by the Italian representative to the conference secretariat was a large volume, requesting amendments to the preamble to the treaty, emphasizing the non-belligerent nature already recognized for Italy. Regarding the issue of Trieste and the Venetian territories, it requested amendments to the internationalization plan proposed by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers, believing that the international zone should be expanded to include certain towns, such as Pola, which currently belongs to Yugoslavia. The issue of the Franco-Italian border was also mentioned briefly. It was hoped that Italian territories would not be included in the treaty, as the fate of the territories has not yet been decided. On the other hand, it expressed its intention to return to its African territories before the future fate of the territories is determined. Regarding economic clauses, Italy raised many objections. The Italian delegation especially expressed its intention to recover Italy's rights in Tangier.</p>
<p>Debate on Treaty Drafts Yields Little Results</p>
<p>Another committee that met today was the Romanian Political Committee, but it adjourned in less than an hour because the British representative opposed the French representative's motion to begin discussing the treaty with Romania, believing that this should be studied after all the amendments have been compiled. Yesterday, six committees of the peace conference met, and their only achievement was to show that the committees still need to go through a week of lengthy debate to review the five treaty drafts item by item. It seems impossible to start this work before next week. Yesterday, the committees met for more than twelve hours, but the discussions were limited to vague questions such as which items in the treaty drafts fell within the scope of each committee's discussion, and whether to start discussing the preamble or certain clauses of the treaty. The actual gains were almost zero.</p>
<p>U.S. and Iranian Representatives Hold Off-Site Talks</p>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. Undersecretary of State Byrnes met with Iranian Foreign Minister Najm in his residence. According to sources in Parisian diplomatic circles, the two discussed the new Iranian crisis caused by the unrest in the Khuzestan oil region. It is said that the British have increased their troops in the port of Basra, Iraq, due to the unstable situation in that area, and it is rumored that the Soviet Union has concentrated a large number of troops on the northern border of Iran in response to the British actions. In addition, Byrnes and the Iranian Foreign Minister discussed the views that Iran is preparing to present on the Italian treaty at the plenary session. The details of the talks were not disclosed.</p>
<h3>Nehru</h3>
<p>Will Personally Attend the Peace Conference to Present the Indian Government's Views</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 19th] According to reliable sources in India, Congress Party Chairman Nehru will travel to Paris to attend the peace conference and present the views of the Indian government as soon as the cabinet is formed. However, due to the tense domestic political situation and heavy responsibilities, he cannot stay abroad for long. It is expected that this trip will not exceed nine days, and he plans to stay in Paris for five days.</p>

<h3>The First Nightingale Song Heard at the Peace Conference; The Female Representative Speaks for the First Time</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 19th] In the discussions at the Paris Peace Conference today, women's voices were heard for the first time. This was Dr. Sekaninová, a female representative of the Czech delegation, who spoke at the Finnish Political and Territorial Committee of the peace conference in support of the Soviet suggestion that the committee should immediately discuss the treaty draft without waiting to receive amendment suggestions.</p>
<h3>Our Wallpaper</h3>
<p>Exports to the United States are Very Popular</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 19th] The first batch of exquisite Chinese wallpaper after the war has arrived in the United States, making homes even more splendid. This type of wallpaper, because it is hand-painted, has long been praised by Americans. The first batch of wallpaper from Denmark and Britain, competing with Chinese wallpaper, has also arrived in the United States.</p>
<p>German Prisoners of War Return Home From the United States.</p>
<p>This is the last batch of 385 prisoners held in New York State to be sent back to Germany. Only 300 prisoners of war remain in the United States for some reason.</p>

<h3>The Indian Government's List is Being Finalized; The Situation in Calcutta is Trending Towards Moderation; Postal and Telegraph Workers Trapped in the Bureau, Out of Food, Calling for Help</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Combined News] Political consultations between the Indian Congress Party and Governor-General Wavell in Delhi will soon come to an end. Acharya met with the Governor-General again this afternoon. It is said that the leadership of the Congress Party has drafted a temporary list of the interim government, but is currently awaiting the consent of some recently recommended personnel. The press speculates that the list will not differ greatly from the personnel mentioned in the Governor-General's statement on June 16, but the seats of the Muslim League will be filled by non-Muslim League personnel. It is reported that the list may be announced on Thursday. The conflict between Indian and Muslim crowds in Calcutta is trending towards moderation on the 20th. Four consecutive days of intense conflict since the 16th have plunged Calcutta, known as India's largest city, into an atmosphere of terror and desolation. Heavy rain on the 19th temporarily halted the fighting, but corpses were piled up in the streets and alleys. British army tanks patrolled the city and were ordered to shoot anyone seen gathering on the streets in groups of five or more. Most of the bodies have not been claimed or buried. Exposed to rain and sun, they emitted a foul odor, and there is a high risk of an epidemic. Hundreds of corpses floated on the river. Those evacuating from various areas gathered in refugee camps, waiting for relief. According to the latest estimates, 7,000 people have died and 24,000 have been injured in the past four days.</p>
<p>According to a broadcast from Paris on the 20th, New Delhi: The New Delhi Postal and Telegraph Authority has just received bad news from the Calcutta Central Postal and Telegraph Office, stating that the staff inside the bureau have been trapped in the office since the 16th and cannot go out. The food inside the bureau has been exhausted, and it is said that five postmen have gone out to try to deliver food, but have gone missing. They are currently requesting emergency assistance and police protection to withdraw from the Postal and Telegraph Administration. In fact, telephone and telegraph communication between New Delhi and Calcutta has not been restored.</p>

<h3>Jerusalem Situation Chaotic, British Garrison Heavily Fortified, British Cabinet to Discuss Palestine Issue Today</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] The situation in Jerusalem is chaotic. According to a French Press Agency dispatch from London, almost all of Jerusalem's military police were mobilized today. Police searched everywhere, and convoys checked pedestrians' identification cards and inspected vehicles and buses for weapons. Armored vehicles patrolled the streets and guarded intersections. Arab troops have been dispatched from Transjordan to assist British forces in protecting all government buildings. The post office has received ten warnings in one week. Furthermore, according to a Reuter's dispatch from London, the British Cabinet is scheduled to discuss the Palestine issue on the 21st. Informed sources said the government may agree to some important conditions proposed by the Jewish people for participating in a joint Arab-Jewish conference in Palestine.

<h3>Japan Escapes Wind Disaster</h3>
<p>[Rēzōsha Tokyo, 20th] MacArthur Headquarters announced today: The 12th hurricane has blown from Ōshima to the southern tip of Kyushu. At 9:00 AM this morning, it was located at 30 degrees 2 minutes North latitude and 129 degrees East longitude and is expected to blow towards Nagasaki, Sasebo, and the Korean Strait. However, it has changed direction by 20 degrees and its force has greatly diminished. The wind speed this morning has decreased to 75 miles per hour. Yesterday, southern Kyushu was spared from the hurricane. If it continues in its current direction, it should dissipate when it reaches the Sea of Japan. The most dangerous situation has passed, and Japan should escape the disaster from the largest 12th hurricane of the summer.</p>
<h3>Total Collapse of Japanese Industry Inevitable: Inflation Accelerates, Prices Soar, Food Scarce, Unemployment Skyrockets</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondent Fu Junyi, Tokyo, 20th] According to reports here, Japanese industry will face a total collapse in the second half of the year. Due to a shortage of raw materials, financial disarray, and surging labor unrest, large-scale enterprises will be unable to continue. According to statistics from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, 40% of the production equipment of 25 major industries has been damaged, and over 10 industries, such as textiles, coal, cement, alkali, and hydroelectric power, have lost 30% of their equipment.</p>
<p>To rebuild Japanese industry, the issues of reparations, unemployment, and inflation must be resolved. If the current situation does not improve, a complete shutdown of industry is only a matter of time. An increase in currency issuance is unavoidable, an increase in production is hopeless, and the food problem will persist, resulting in further price increases. According to authoritative observations from the Bank of Japan, currency issuance will increase to 72 billion yen by the end of September and to 93.3 billion yen by the end of December. Prices have already risen to 12 times pre-war levels, while black market prices are 100 times pre-war levels. If the food shortage continues and the Japanese government does not change its economic policies, the economic crisis caused by the defeat in the war may occur in November.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Minister of Health and Welfare, the number of unemployed has reached 2.5 million; including demobilized soldiers and repatriated Japanese, the total number is 5 million. Rebuilt private enterprises can accommodate 1.3 million people, but it will be very difficult to completely solve unemployment. The food problem remains extremely critical between August and September because, although the weather is suitable, there is a lack of fertilizer. Optimists estimate that, despite the fertilizer shortage, the harvest may reach 60 million kan (equivalent to 49,629 dou), while others estimate it will be 52 million to 53 million kan. Recently, there have been rumors here that food rations will be increased to 3 gō, changing the previously set 2.3 gō.</p>
<h3>Analysis of the General Situation on the Eve of the Japanese Reparations Conference: US Has Not Yet Received Soviet Reply, Plan Awaiting Joint Decision by Relevant Countries</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, 20th] The Japanese reparations conference is scheduled to be held in the United States in early or late September. The Far Eastern Commission, in the name of the US government, has invited the governments of relevant countries to participate, requesting a response by the 15th of this month. All invited countries except the Soviet Union have responded before that date. It is not yet known whether the Soviet Union will accept the invitation. Officials in Washington hope that the Soviet Union will provide some response, because if the Soviet Union responds, it will have to take a decisive position on the issue of Japanese assets outside of Japan proper. The Soviet Union claims that the assets of Japanese people in the three northeastern provinces are "war booty," a claim that is unlikely to be supported by the majority of the eleven countries on the Far Eastern Commission. To date, the Soviet Union has insisted that Japanese assets in mainland China and the three northeastern provinces should not be included in Japan's reparations to the United Nations. The US reparations commissioner recently returned from inspecting the world. According to his estimates, the Soviet Union transported 200 billion yen worth of Japanese assets from the three northeastern provinces to the Soviet Union without the consent of the United Nations, claiming that this industrial equipment was "war booty." On the other hand, China does not mind sharing Japanese-built industrial facilities within its borders with other United Nations. In order to cope with this situation, the US authorities have drafted a "temporary plan" according to which, if the reparations conference is not held on schedule, 20% of the Japanese industrial equipment under the reparations items will be allocated to East India, the Philippines, and other regions of the Pacific. However, this plan does not preclude the possibility of convening a reparations conference in the future, because Japan's reparations issue cannot be decided unilaterally and requires a joint decision, and only a joint decision can achieve the stability of the entire economic life of the East in the future.</p>

<h3>Puyi Recounts Inside Story of Manchukuo: Kwantung Army Used Opium to Poison the Northeast; 6 Million Immigrants in 20 Years</h3>
<p>[Reuter's, Tokyo, 20th] Puppet Emperor Puyi today continued to answer direct questions from Prosecutor Keenan at the Far East International Tribunal. It is said that the Kwantung Army guaranteed the people would ban opium, but instead made it a 200 million yen per year business, which was net profit, the Japanese even openly sold smoking permits. They began to develop the two provinces in the Northeast that grew poppies. After the spread of opium, poppy cultivation spread to the other three provinces. The Kwantung Army was determined to undermine the morale of the Chinese people, destroy their health, and deprive them of the opportunity to resist aggression. People in the Northeast between the ages of 18 and 45 had to serve in the labor force, building roads and mining for the Japanese army. Those who attempted to evade labor service were severely punished. Chinese laborers were treated extremely poorly, without medicine when sick, with thin clothing, and living in squalid conditions. Food was scarce and filthy, unfit for human consumption. The Japanese used the manpower and production of the Northeast to make it their arsenal. In 20 years, 6 million Japanese people immigrated to the Northeast, seizing land from local residents. Counterfeit currency was printed in Japan and the people of the Northeast were forced to use it.</p>
<h3>American United China Relief Renamed: United Service to China</h3>

Edison said that the organization is seeking to expand its long-term programs to provide lasting benefits to the Chinese people.</p>
<h3>US Superfortress Conducts Cosmic Ray Measurement Flight</h3>
<p>[Reuter's, Washington, 19th] The US Army Air Forces announced today that it will work with military scientists to explore the mysteries of cosmic rays to make them a new source of atomic energy. A B-29 Superfortress is scheduled to fly from Dayton to Boston today, carrying special equipment and technicians, and then engage in the most extensive flight. Another Superfortress, named "Flying Laboratory," completed a cosmic ray experimental flight from Canada to South America last week. This experiment is jointly organized by the National Geographic Society and the Bartol Research Foundation. The experiments of military scientists, led by Dr. Rossi, will delve into the energy particles produced by the splitting of cosmic rays in the Earth's atmosphere. Some of these particles have millions of times more power than the splitting particles of atomic bombs, but it is doubtful whether this power can be applied. If possible, it would allow the scientific community to fully utilize atomic nuclei, which were previously not fully utilized. If this power can be developed, atoms other than uranium can also be used to generate power.</p>
<h3>Old Senator Norris, Father of National Water Conservancy Project (Part II): Devoted His Life to Water Conservancy</h3>
<p>— Our American Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>In the 1932 election year, Norris exerted his greatest efforts to promote Roosevelt. He traveled to many states, giving speeches in each state, urging citizens to vote for Roosevelt. This time, Norris was victorious. Roosevelt won the election in November, and in December, he and Norris took a train to Tennessee. They looked at the turbulent waves of the Tennessee River, anticipating the future great water conservancy project, and were very happy. Roosevelt stood on the rocks by the river, leisurely taking out a cigar, and said as he smoked, "George (Norris's nickname), this should be the happiest moment of your life, right?" "Yes, it should be the happiest moment of my life. My dream finally has a chance to be realized!" Roosevelt was so moved, he said, "Thank God! An extraordinary president needs to know how to dream!" On April 10, 1933, President Roosevelt gave a speech to both houses of Congress, praising Norris's great ideals and plans. On May 18, the President signed the TVA Act. From the time the TVA was established in Tennessee in 1933, all of Norris's efforts were focused there. Although he did not bear actual responsibility, in fact, he was the highest informal leader of the TVA. He kept in regular contact with the three directors to discuss major plans. He personally drove to see the water conservancy project, and he saw with his own eyes the completion of one dam after another. To commemorate his heroic struggle, the TVA named the first completed dam the Norris Dam, and the town that was transformed from barren mountains into a town because of the dam was called</p>
<p>Norris Town.</p>
<p>Norris was not from Tennessee, but because of his achievements, the people of Tennessee all felt grateful to him. Norris's name is now the name of many hotels and shops in Tennessee, and the name of many streets. In Tennessee, you can see pictures of Norris everywhere, a hard-working and honest old man.</p>
<p>Norris is no longer alive! He died in the summer of the year before last (1944). He died before the war ended, but he already knew that the TVA's massive power had laid the cornerstone for victory. A few days before his death, the chief engineer told him, "The last Kentucky dam has been completed." He felt that his life's mission had come to a complete end. Norris's body died, but his spirit, his achievements, gained eternal life! I was assigned to look at reference books in the library of the TVA headquarters in Knoxville. I found many biographies about Norris. This newsletter is excerpted from "Norris: The Complete Personality" by Neuberger and Kahn, "George Norris: Fighting Liberal" by Lowitt, and Mr. Norris's autobiography "Fighting for Democracy."

<h3>Aftermath of the Bloody Clash Between Hindus and Muslims in Calcutta: Clubs and Stones Used as Weapons, Numerous Casualties, Armed Military Police Fully Mobilized for Suppression</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, New Delhi, 19th] According to witnesses of the riots in Calcutta, the Muslim League held "Direct Action," and all shops in the city were closed. On the morning of the 16th of this month, Muslims gathered in the streets and attacked Hindus. At 9:00 AM, riots broke out in many places from the right bank of the Hooghly River to the Ballygunge residential area. The news spread quickly, and Hindus formed groups and marched towards the city center with clubs in their hands. Muslims, holding the green flags of the Muslim League, also marched towards that location. At the same time, about 300 Muslims rushed to Park Street, destroying all Hindu shops and tying up the shop owners and beating them. The police cavalry arrived and lashed the crowd with long bamboo whips, and the rioters scattered. Dozens of injured people were lying on the ground. Suddenly, a large number of Muslims rushed from other places and counterattacked the police. The police were outnumbered, and some were dragged down from their horses. The crowd trampled on them and then dispersed. Similar incidents occurred in many places at the same time, and the police were not adequately distributed to cope. At 12:00 noon, the police began to use tear gas and fire at the rioters. Between 3:00 PM and 6:00 PM, the police did not continue to intervene but only stationed at certain locations, and the Hindu-Muslim conflict continued unabated. Until the evening, the police patrolled again and saw corpses and wounded people lying all over the streets, and immediately cleaned them up. Gunfire was heard again at night, as well as the sirens of ambulances and fire trucks, and there were also conflicts in the suburbs. On the evening of that day, some Muslims came from various places and scattered on both sides of the desolate streets. After a brief conversation, they rushed towards a certain Hindu grocery store, broke the door and rushed in. The shop owner was an old man, and he was immediately tied up, while his son had escaped. The rioters threw stones at the old man, saw his head was cracked and scattered one by one. However, the Hindus were no less cruel. They severely whipped two Muslims until they were on the verge of death, and then ran them over with an ox cart. Bloodshed continued to occur the next day. Public offices were temporarily closed, telephone lines were cut, and the alarms of the police station were no longer heard. The rioters fled as soon as they saw the police. The police authorities felt that their forces were insufficient to cope with this riot. Fortunately, with the assistance of the military, they were gradually able to suppress it. It is said that some battalions of the Muslim army were deemed unreliable and were kept in the barracks and not allowed to go out. As for the Europeans, they did not suffer any damage. Some foreigners often roamed the streets during the conflict and no one paid attention to them. Currently, telegraph and telephone communication between Calcutta and other places has been cut off, and it is in a state of isolation.</p>
<h3>Various Industries Strengthen Their Own Organizations, Coordinate with Economic Reform Policies: Important Proposals from the City Chamber of Commerce Meeting to Jointly Assist the Government in Maintaining Price Stability</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] In light of the government's exchange rate adjustment, the City Chamber of Commerce, intending to cooperate with various industry associations to maintain price stability, specifically convened a discussion meeting yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, gathering relevant industry associations. Those present included Xu Jiguang, Jin Runxiang, Shou Jingwei, Ge Jiecun, Pan Shihao, Tu Hui, Yan Esheng, Gu Bingyuan representing the Social Affairs Bureau Director, and responsible individuals from various industry associations, totaling approximately over one hundred people. The meeting began with a speech by Xu Jiguang, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, who briefly stated: Today's meeting is, on one hand, to report on the progress of the industry and commerce petition delegation's appeal; and on the other hand, it is because the government has revised the exchange rate with the aim of revitalizing industry and commerce and stimulating exports. However, in order to ensure that commodity prices do not rise in response, thereby undermining the government's good intentions in adjusting the exchange rate, we have specifically convened a discussion meeting with relevant industry associations. We hope to earnestly cooperate with the government to maintain stable prices. During a meeting with Mayor Wu today, it was reported that Western medicines had risen by 80% yesterday, and sugar prices had also risen sharply. Therefore, it is crucial to thoroughly implement government policies, make efforts to suppress and stabilize prices, and avoid arbitrarily raising prices. Subsequently, Jin Runxiang, Shou Jingwei, and Pan Shihao each reported on the progress of the industry and commerce petition delegation's appeal in Beijing.</p>
<p>Deeply Hoping for Good Use of the Price Negotiation System</p>
<p>Gu Bingyuan stated in his speech: The government's recent adjustment of the exchange rate and the abolition of export taxes have greatly benefited the industrial, commercial, and export sectors. It is sincerely hoped that various industries will not become alarmed by the exchange rate adjustment, so as not to cause various obstacles. If, due to the increase in the exchange rate, commodity prices are also raised accordingly, the effect of adjusting the exchange rate will be completely lost. Moreover, after unreasonable price increases, the cost of living for workers will increase, which will in turn affect production costs. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that various industry associations will make good use of the existing price negotiation system, and within the scope of legal profits, carefully negotiate fair and reasonable commodity prices. Do not engage in black market transactions, otherwise, in order to stabilize people's livelihoods, the authorities will have no choice but to adopt intervention policies. Currently, the government has the authority to dispose of various commodities, such as cotton yarn from textile mills and sugar from the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, which will remain at their original prices without increases. Therefore, it is hoped that various industries will also understand the government's determination, maintain stable prices, take advantage of the current good opportunity of rising foreign goods to promote domestic products. Various industries should automatically assist the government in suppressing commodity prices, so that the government's various policies to protect the industrial and commercial sectors can be gradually implemented.</p>
<p>Mr. Luo Qinghua Proposes Two Points</p>
<p>Luo Qinghua was unable to attend the meeting due to illness, but a letter was delivered to the meeting, which was read by Yan Esheng. The letter proposed two points: (1) How to strengthen one's own organization in accordance with the new Industry Association Law, and coordinate with the government's economic reform policies to achieve thorough implementation and achieve practical results. (2) How to rectify the industry regulations of various industries, relying on the powers granted to each association by the new Association Law, and using organizational strength, to revise the industry regulations separately for each industry (clearly stipulating penalties for breach of contract).</p>
<p>Increased Prices of New Drugs Still Insufficient to Cover Costs</p>
<p>A representative from the new pharmaceutical industry stated: Since the adjustment of foreign exchange rates, major members of the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association have not raised drug prices by as much as 80%. However, there are currently many new pharmaceutical companies that have not joined the association, especially stall vendors, and the selling prices are therefore lacking in standards. However, when member companies opened their doors for business yesterday, customers flocked in, mostly searching for various imported tonics and daily medicines, making it truly difficult to cope. Currently, the average increase in prices for various imported new drugs is approximately 5% to 20%. Taking yellow Vaseline as an example, the cost is approximately 240 yuan per pound. Overseas imports are also extremely high, and the price has fallen sharply below the cost, to only 200 yuan per pound. As of yesterday's market price, it was still only 220 yuan to 260 yuan per pound. As for products from Swiss pharmaceutical companies such as Roche and Ciba, they have all increased prices by 60% since the exchange rate adjustment. Therefore, although some imported goods in the new pharmaceutical industry have currently increased in price, they are still insufficient to cover costs. It is greatly hoped that a price negotiation system can be established to prevent drastic increases and decreases in market prices.</p>
<p>Sugar Industry Representatives Explain Difficulties</p>
<p>Representatives of the sugar industry stated: Wholesalers have received only 25,000 bags of sugar from the Taiwan Sugar Corporation's ninth and tenth installments over the past month. It is currently summer, and the demand for sugar is relatively high. Wholesalers mostly add a combined profit of 7,000 yuan per bag and then sell it. The main issue is that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation cannot distribute enough sugar, and sugar cannot be freely sold. Otherwise, sugar prices can be expected to naturally become cheaper. He stated: When meeting with Mayor Wu today, he was also ordered to be responsible for cracking down on the black market for sugar, and will do his best to persuade member companies to comply. However, there are several applications to join the association every day. Moreover, it is heard that once these new member companies obtain registration certificates from the Social Affairs Bureau, they will have legal effect, which makes it difficult to deal with. Regarding this point, Gu Bingyuan of the Social Affairs Bureau specifically explained: For each installment of sugar distributed by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, the Social Affairs Bureau must negotiate the distribution method to ensure it is distributed at the limited price of 70,000 yuan per shi dan. However, some sugar merchants also dispose of the sugar as they please after receiving it. This shows that the management of the industry association itself is not very thorough, and the government finds it necessary to strengthen management. As the government distributes sugar at fair prices, it sincerely hopes that all citizens can benefit universally. Currently, the Social Affairs Bureau is considering further improving the distribution method, and hopes that sugar merchants will not hoard sugar or refuse to sell it after obtaining it. The sugar industry association and the Social Affairs Bureau should both be responsible for the establishment and membership of new sugar businesses. The association should thoroughly investigate the qualifications of each new member. If there are any improper practices, it should notify the Social Affairs Bureau as much as possible, which will not issue a registration certificate.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Ma Shaoquan, representatives of the flour industry in the Fourth District, representatives of the paper industry, and representatives of the beer industry all made statements. Finally, two resolutions were passed: (1) Ask each industry association to separately convene its members and thoroughly discuss the principles of maintaining fair prices. (2) The two proposals made by Luo Qinghua will be submitted to the Chamber of Commerce's Standing Council to organize a subcommittee for research.</p>
<p>Before the adjournment of the meeting, Yan Esheng, Secretary-General of the City Chamber of Commerce, added: The Chamber of Commerce previously distributed 240 profit tax forms to various industry associations, but to date, only over 100 have been received. Therefore, it is hoped that the industry associations that have not yet submitted them will fill them out and submit them as soon as possible for compilation.</p>
<p>Xu Kan Meets with Flour Industry Representatives</p>
<p>Minister Xu Kan met with representatives from the flour mills and flour industry associations at the Grain Department's Shanghai office at 10:00 AM yesterday, stipulating that the retail profit for the flour industry is limited to 400 yuan per bag.</p>
<h3>Zhu Si-huang Provides Opinions on Current Economic Plans</h3>
<p>According to Banking Association Secretary-General Zhu Si-huang's recent statement on the new exchange rate adjustment: According to economic principles, the exchange rate responsibility is to first make imported goods more expensive, and domestic commodity prices will naturally follow suit. This is a natural economic trend and difficult to avoid. The following points must be noted currently: (1) Ways must be found to supply daily necessities for the people. (2) Unreasonable price increases must be suppressed. Price policies should focus on stability in the future. (3) Those who hoard goods should be severely punished. (4) Imports of production tools should be tried by all means. The overall trade policy should be determined as soon as possible. In short, it is hoped that the industrial and commercial sectors will benefit from this change, and that ordinary people will not suffer from high living costs, and that a few who are quick to purchase and hoard foreign goods will not be given the opportunity to make a fortune.</p>
<h3>Clearing Out Warehouse Stock</h3>
<p>Jiang Tingfu Consults with the Ministry of Communications</p>
<p>[Our Own Report] Due to the fact that the materials currently stored in the warehouses by the Executive Headquarters of the Executive Yuan are mostly equipment allocated to the Ministry of Communications, Director of the Executive Headquarters Jiang Tingfu personally went to Beijing yesterday to consult with the Ministry of Communications on ways to expedite the clearing of these stocks.</p>
<h3>Perfect and Beautiful</h3>
<p>Wang Yunmei, Xie Jiahua, and Liu Deming Elected as Miss Shanghai</p>
<p>Dance Queen Guan Minli, Song Queen Han Qingqing, and Ping Opera Yan Huizhu: The Unprecedented Xin Xianlin Event Ends at Midnight</p>
<p>[Our Special Report] Last night, amidst the cheers of over 3,000 people in the Xin Xianlin ballroom, the first Miss Shanghai since the War of Resistance was born. Wang Yunmei was elected "Miss Shanghai" with 65,500 votes. Miss Xie Jiahua came in second with 25,430 votes, and Miss Liu Deming came in third with 8,500 votes. Refugees benefited from their charitable activities, receiving over 99 million in donations, saving many more lives.</p>
<p>Yan Huizhu from the Ping Opera group was elected Empress of Ping Opera, receiving 37,700 votes. Han Qingqing was elected Song Queen, receiving 20,000 votes. Guan Minli was elected Dance Queen, receiving 23,150 votes.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Xin Xianlin ballroom, from the entrance to the interior, was magnificently decorated. At night, the lights and decorations made it even more dazzling. Above the entrance, a red silk banner with gold characters read "Shanghai Fundraising Committee of the Subei Refugee Relief Association Garden Party." Below, four gauze lanterns hung, spelling out the words "Garden Party." Upon entering, there was a voting booth, immediately reminding people of the "election." Along both sides of the entrance, there were staff collecting votes, and several newspaper offices were giving away copies of that day's newspaper. Many visitors and guests were reading this newspaper's "Miss Shanghai Special Edition."</p>
<p>Following the flower path lined with greenery, a turn led to the large and smooth garden dance floor. In front of the door to the ballroom on the rear right side of the dance floor, a platform was built. The platform was decorated with potted plants and hung with lights. Vases of flowers were also placed on the marble tables. In front of the platform, there were four wooden boxes tied with colored ribbons, labeled "Dance Queen," "Ping Opera Queen," "Miss Shanghai," and "Song Queen" from left to right, each with three slits in the sealed wooden lid, waiting for the votes to be cast.</p>
<p>Around 7:00 PM, cars stopped and left at the entrance in an endless stream, leaving behind thousands of guests. Before 8:00 PM, almost all the seats in the garden were filled. For a time, the light of hairpins and shadows, and colorful flowers were dazzling, and the fashionable women's clothing created an unprecedentedly enthusiastic atmosphere.</p>
<p>At this time, the award ceremony for the winners of the previous charity dance had already begun inside the ballroom. First, Mr. Du Yuesheng gave a speech, thanking the dance stars who participated in the previous charity dance. Then, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Kaixian, presented the awards. The dance halls that enthusiastically participated in the charity event all received certificates. More than 30 dancers each received a Cross of Honor medal.</p>
<p>When the clock struck 8:00 PM, the music started, and three spotlights simultaneously shone a bright silver light on the stage. A loud voice came from the microphone, announcing the start of the event. Seated on the stage were Xu Jilian, Deputy Speaker of the Municipal Council, and Li, Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, among others. Wang Xianqing, Executive Director of the Association, gave a speech first, briefly stating: Everyone's enthusiasm for charity and promotion of the spirit of human love and mutual assistance is deeply appreciated. Xu, Deputy Speaker of the Assembly, spoke next, saying that holding the election was on one hand to increase interest, and on the other hand to gain human sympathy. Deputy Speaker Xu also said that the disaster being rescued now is a man-made disaster, which is very painful, and we should provide assistance based on human compassion. Mr. Xu concluded: It is very happy to have this kind of interest after the victory. Deputy Director Li's insightful speech first praised Mr. Du Yuesheng's contribution to social relief, then clarified some criticisms and slanders from the outside world, explaining that the significance of the election lies in human compassion and achieving the purpose of relief, and finally briefly discussed the difference between superficial beauty and inner beauty, saying that the Misses who participated in the election all have great compassion, which is inner beauty. Yang Xiaotian also spoke.</p>
<p>While the hosts on the stage were giving their speeches, people were continuously voting in the four ballot boxes in front of the stage. The number of onlookers in the garden also increased every moment, eventually becoming shoulder-to-shoulder, with almost no room to stand. Every rattan table on the lawn in the garden was full of people, and even the open-air dance floor in front of the stage was full of people sitting on the ground. Whenever people saw a bright and beautiful candidate, they immediately began to comment. Wang Yunmei was sitting in a corner with two Miss Du and five or six close friends, which was the center of news last night. Reporters constantly asked questions, and Life Magazine also took a photo of her.</p>
<p>Entertainment programs followed one after another, with technical performances, singing, and comedy. People listened, watched, and waited anxiously for the final announcement.</p>
<p>At 9:45 PM, someone announced on the microphone to invite singing stars to perform, and the crowd immediately responded with enthusiastic echoes, urging the two singing star candidates, Han Qingqing and Zhang Yiwen. Zhang sang "Roses Everywhere." Then, after a few more bursts of applause, Han Qingqing finally arrived gracefully. Her low, silvery voice came from the microphone, she said, "The refugees in Subei are too bitter, so I came to participate..." She responded to the crowd's enthusiastic shouts and sang her most beloved "Romana." Thunderous applause, one after another, lasted for a long time...</p>
<p>Time passed minute by minute. Although the strongman Wang Bangfu and his siblings won unanimous praise, the reporters were anxious and had no mood to appreciate it. Minute by minute, time passed slowly. Executive Director Wang Xian led five clean refugee children and introduced their happy encounters, ... but who had the patience to listen carefully.</p>
<p>At 11:10 PM, the votes were finally counted amidst thousands of calls. First, "Miss Shanghai" was opened. After the box was inspected, it was moved to the stage, and the vote counters inspected the ballots and removed them. Then, the empty box was shown to the public. On one side, the votes were sorted into rankings. Over 3,000 tense heartstrings were united in waiting for the final announcement. Over 30 cameras were waiting for the birth of the Miss.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, the results of the election were loudly announced through the microphone: "Miss Wang Yunmei received 65,500 votes and was elected Miss Shanghai." The runner-up was Miss Xie Jiahua, with 25,430 votes. Miss Liu Deming had 8,500 votes, Miss Pan Zhiyi had 6,375 votes, and so on, with as few as 500-600 votes to 30-40 votes, of course their enthusiastic disaster relief is equally worthy of praise.</p>
<p>After the results were announced, the top three Miss Shanghai winners were invited to the stage, bathed in the silver light of the spotlights and watched by the cameras. At this time, coincidentally, a strange call came from the microphone, saying: "Mr. Du, please invite General Fan Shaozeng to the stage for a conversation." This was called twice, but disappointingly, General Fan didn't come to the stage. Miss Shanghai went off the stage.</p>
<p>The remaining three groups of elections were also conducted in a very tense atmosphere, with the following results:</p>
<p>[Ping Opera Queen] Yan Huizhu: 37,700 votes. Runner-up Cao Huilin: 10,600 votes. (There are two extra tickets, totaling 200 votes) (Song Queen) Han Qingqing: 20,000 votes. Runner-up Zhang Yiwen: 1,000 votes. (Dance Queen) Guan Minli: 23,150 votes. Runner-up Gu Lihua: 500 votes. After the vote count was completed, all the elected "Miss Shanghai" and queens of each group went to the indoor ballroom to take photos. Wang Xianqing also announced that the award ceremony will be held on another auspicious day. Entertainment programs were still going on in the garden, fireworks sparks flew in the air, and the audience gradually dispersed, the half-night revelry had come to an end.</p>
<p>Dance Queen Guan Minli</p>
<h3>Odds and Ends from the Venue</h3>
<p>Among the Miss Shanghai, the earliest to arrive was socialite Wang Yunmei. Wang wore a dark green satin, long-sleeved cheongsam with silver sequins on the chest and green silk gloves. As soon as she sat down, she was surrounded by reporters.</p>
<p>All four queens wore colorful flowers in their hair, but the most striking was the one worn by Wang Yunmei. The flower was made of chicken feathers, dyed yellow, and the petals swayed in the wind, looking like fresh peacock feathers from afar.</p>
<p>Ping Opera Queen Yan Huizhu said: I didn't put on much makeup when I participated in the election today. I just hope to come and see the excitement. If I can attract votes, it will be a blessing for the disaster victims.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was extremely tense a moment before the vote count. The person in charge shouted one, two, three, four... on the stage, and stopped voting at ten.</p>
<p>When the votes were counted, the ballot box was shown to the public on the spot, just like a magician showing the audience clearly first.</p>
<p>When the elected queens took the stage, flowers flew around and magnesium lights flashed.</p>
<p>Among the elected queens, the one with the most expressive expression was the runner-up of the socialite group, Xie Jiahua. Miss Xie wore a long-sleeved red chiffon evening dress and two large red paper flowers. After taking the stage, she covered her face with a white gauze handkerchief, showing all kinds of charming looks. The cheers from the audience were endless.</p>
<p>Queen Wang Yunmei of the socialite group sat at a table with Mr. Du Yuesheng's eldest and second daughters, while Yan Huizhu sat with Yang Hu. Before the vote count, Yang Hu's daughter said to Yan Huizhu: "After you are elected queen, you must treat me to dinner."</p>
<p>Singers Han Qingjing and Zhang Yiwen were inseparable. Zhang Yiwen said before the vote count that the queen must be Han Qingjing and that she had no hope herself. Participating in the election this time was only to relieve the refugees.</p>
<p>After the enthusiastic request of the guests, Zhang Yiwen sang "Roses, Roses Everywhere" on the spot, and Han Qingjing sang "Romana" and gave a speech on disaster relief, receiving thunderous applause and cheers.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the most prominent people in the venue, besides the "Queens", were the photography reporters, who occupied almost the entire stage.</p>
<p>There were many pickpockets in the venue yesterday, taking the opportunity to be active, specializing in stealing women's purses. Many people were arrested on the spot by the military police. These thieves were well-dressed and had purchased tickets to enter the venue. It is heard that there are many stolen goods, which are now stored in the detective section on the fourth floor of the Southern Police Bureau. It is hoped that those who have lost items will go to claim them today.</p>
<h3>An Incident at the Venue: Reporter Chen He Was Reported on the Spot</h3>
<p>Chen He, who once served as a director of the enemy puppet "Greater East Asia Anti-British and American Association" and was the most enthusiastic advocate of the "Greater East Asia March," was actually the announcer of the conference yesterday and sang "Hot Blood" on his own initiative. He was reported on the spot by guests and reporters and was expelled before the end of the event. It is heard that several comrades who have suffered have jointly formally reported him to the relevant authorities.</p>
<h3>Hengtong Road Fire: Hundreds of Millions in Losses, One Apprentice Burned to Death</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] A certain beancurd shop at No. 95 Hengtong Road, Zhabei, suddenly caught fire due to a motor fire around 1:25 AM yesterday, and the fire spread to its neighbors on the left and right, Nos. 93 and 97, and from No. 99 to No. 101, a warehouse containing a large number of cotton cloth and other items. Once ignited, the fire spread rapidly. Although the Zhabei Central Fire Department and other departments drove to the scene to rescue, it was not easy to extinguish for a while, and it was not until 5 AM at dawn that the fire was extinguished. When the fire was raging, Wu Shanhui (16 years old), an apprentice in the beancurd shop, was burned all over his body. It was not until the afternoon that he was carried to the Gongji Hospital for treatment, but because it had been too long, the fire poison attacked his heart, and he soon died.

<h3>Confiscating an Arms Trafficking Organization: Three Key Russian, Japanese, and Korean Suspects Apprehended After Three Days and Nights of Arduous Investigation by the Garrison Command</h3>
<p>On August 16th, the Investigation Department of the Songhu Garrison Command received a tip that an international arms trafficking organization had secretly established itself in Shanghai, engaging in large-scale activities. Director Tao, adhering to Commander Xuan's established policy for Shanghai's security, immediately instructed Investigation Team Leader Feng Zhongda and Deputy Team Leader Sheng Changfu to direct Team Leader Wang Wanshi of the Second Team to take full responsibility for the case and solve it within a set time. At approximately 11:00 AM that morning, Team Leader Wang, disguised as an arms buyer along with Ling Xiao, and dispatched Zhang Shangqing, Liu Guangqi, and Tang Mingbo to provide covert liaison and support. After assigning tasks, they proceeded to a secret room based on the lead. The room was exceptionally dark, airtight, and after waiting for a long time, a Japanese man named Toshio Ii entered the room and told the informant (i.e., the original reporter) that surveillance outside was tight, and that the weapons could only be moved late at night. After speaking, he left. At 6:00 PM, Toshio returned, saying that the person hiding the ammunition was elsewhere, and then left again. It wasn't until 11:00 PM that Toshio returned, leading Team Leader Wang and others to 38 Wuxing Lane, Yangshupu. A Russian man named Koosin came out and agreed to sell</p>
<p>Carbine Bullets</p>
<p>Over two thousand rounds, to be delivered at 10:00 AM the next day. Team Leader Wang and others then returned to the team. The following day (the 17th), at 10:00 AM, they departed on time in two cars. Team Leader Wang, accompanied by Zhang Shangqing, Lian Ronggao, and the Japanese Toshio Ii, rode in the front car, guiding the way. The rear car, with Xu Daqin, Zhou Jiaqi, Yan Gang, and others, followed covertly, keeping a distance to prevent accidents. The cars arrived at the Russian man Koosin's house. Koosin had just returned from outside and instructed them to proceed carefully to avoid exposure, also stating that the price was 400,000 yuan. Wang and the others agreed to reassure him. Koosin then hired rickshaws to go to a certain place to</p>
<p>Retrieve the Weapons</p>
<p>Wang and others sent personnel to follow secretly. Koosin went to 85 Guangyu Lane, Yulin Road, to retrieve two crates of ammunition, totaling 2,124 rounds, and two magazine clips. Although there was witness testimony, Team Leader Wang wanted to leverage the transaction to investigate other trafficking operations, so he did not make an arrest at that time. They immediately drove back. At that time, many Russians were found scattered around the road nearby, indicating that their arrangements were quite elaborate. While secretly monitoring the arms trafficking suspect Toshio Ii, they continued to investigate the arms trafficking organization. On the 18th, Team Leader Wang dispatched a team of three, Li Zuishi, Wei Pu, and Zhou Zhenming, and again invited Toshio, traveling in two cars, back to 38 Wuxing Lane, Huishan Road, to the</p>
<p>Russian Man Koosin's</p>
<p>House. Upon arrival, personnel were secretly dispatched and stationed around the area to monitor all activity. The signal to consolidate all efforts in case of an emergency was a raised right hand. Team Leader Wang and the other investigators reconnoitered the area and then entered 38 Wuxing Lane. At that time, the Russian Koosin suddenly avoided meeting them. After various ploys, Koosin was coaxed into meeting. He firmly denied being able to procure firearms and constantly observed the investigators with a sharp gaze. Team Leader Wang and others remained calm and showed no signs of suspicion. After repeated negotiations, Koosin agreed to discuss it again the next day. The investigators then left, with personnel secretly stationed around the area to</p>
<p>Secretly Monitor</p>
<p>Koosin's actions. According to another tip, the Russian Koosin was planning to leave Shanghai and return to his country soon. The investigators were extremely anxious. At noon, they returned to Koosin's house to discuss the matter. He stated that he had telegraphed various parties who agreed to procure a carbine rifle, but the price was very high, and he would need 400,000 yuan upfront. Koosin then went out, and Wang's team sent personnel to follow secretly. Ten minutes later, Koosin returned, carrying seven small cans of gun oil, valued at 17,500 yuan, and said that the gun would be retrieved at 6:00 PM, instructing them to send one person in the car with him. Zhang Shangqing and Lian Ronggao were sent on the dangerous mission, while Team Leader Wang led the personnel who were hiding in the surrounding area, following covertly in a car as backup. The car arrived at the gate of the Lyceum Theatre on Meiqi Road. Koosin asked them to stop. After a while,</p>
<p>Foreign Men and Women</p>
<p>One by one, boarded the original car and drove back to Huishan Road. Koosin then asked Zhang and Lian to get out of the car and told them to wait at the Guangming Cafe on Huishan Road. When Team Leader Wang and the others returned to the designated location, Koosin was already there, carrying a carbine, 256 rounds of ammunition, and two magazine clips. At the same time, several individuals resembling Koosin's associates were found near the Guangming Cafe, scattered around. At this point, Team Leader Wang quickly apprehended Koosin and dragged him into the car, driving back to the team's headquarters. That night, the suspects Toshio Ii and Koosin were interrogated severely.</p>
<p>Toshio Ii Confessed</p>
<p>That he was 22 years old, from Tokyo, Japan, a graduate of the Faculty of Law at Hosei University, and had served as a special intelligence officer in the General Staff Headquarters of the Japanese China Expeditionary Force. He currently resided at the house of a Korean man surnamed Fang at 133 Zha Pu Road. Before the victory, he had worked in Nanjing and Wuhu. He arrived in Shanghai in December of the 34th year (1945) and had been living in Shanghai since the victory. He had been introduced to the Russian Koosin by Fang and admitted to helping him sell weapons. The Russian</p>
<p>Koosin Confessed</p>
<p>That he was 31 years old, spoke six languages, and had been a teacher at the Harbin Middle School. He came to Shanghai in December of the 29th year (1940) and opened the Guoshan Foreign Company at 240 Gongping Road. In the 31st year (1942), he worked as a translator in the 11th Detachment of the Third War Area of China (stationed in Kunshan) for five months. Later, he served as a language instructor in the 4th Tank Battalion of the Chinese Army. He resigned when the team was deployed to the north and then hid in Shanghai. He had sold firearms and ammunition four times and confessed that he had met the Japanese Toshio Ii through a</p>
<p>Korean Introduction</p>
<p>The Fang was living upstairs at 133 Zha Pu Road. The next day (the 19th), at 6:00 PM, together with the local police station and the Baojia chief, they returned to the Russian Koosin's house for a search, confiscating carbine ammunition and nine magazine clips. Personnel were dispatched to 133 Zha Pu Road to arrest the Korean man surnamed Fang and bring him back to the station. He confessed that his name was Fang Jianshu, 30 years old, Korean, and admitted that he had been asked by the Russian to introduce the Japanese Toshio Ii to help sell firearms and ammunition. In summary, the case resulted in the arrest of the main arms trafficking suspect, a Russian named Koosin, an accessory to the crime, a Japanese named Toshio Ii, and a Korean named Fang Jianshu (with photos). Three confiscations of weapons totaled four types of items (see attached photos): carbines, bullets, magazine clips, and gun oil. From obtaining the initial leads to solving the case, it only took three days. The personnel who handled the case worked tirelessly for three days and nights, successfully dismantling an international secret arms trafficking organization, which greatly contributed to the security of the city.</p>
<h3>Raising Education Funds and Organizing a National Goods Market: Five-Day Charity Sale Scheduled, with a Fundraising Target of at Least 1.5 Billion</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Municipal Education Loan Committee, in order to provide assistance to impoverished students this semester, is co-organizing a "National Goods Market" with the National Goods Movement Committee to raise education loan funds. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, the committee held a reception at the International Hotel's 14th floor for the city's business, industrial, educational sectors. Attendees included Chairman Pan Gongzhan of the Municipal Council, Deputy Director Li Mou of the Municipal Education Bureau, President Wang Zhiwei of Datong University, Hu Boxiang of the Home Industries Association, Tian Heqing of the National Goods Movement Committee, as well as over a hundred people from the industrial and commercial sectors, school principals, and newspaper reporters. The event began with a speech by Chairman Li Mou, who stated that the education loan program has been held three times and that this time the need is particularly urgent and the amount is particularly large. This semester, due to price increases, private schools have greatly increased tuition fees: primary school fees range from 80,000 to 120,000, junior high from 120,000 to 160,000, senior high from 160,000 to 200,000, and universities from 200,000 to 250,000. In this situation, impoverished students are naturally greatly affected. The Education Bureau must take both sides into consideration. On the one hand, we must ensure that private schools can maintain themselves financially, and on the other hand, we must minimize the impact on the educational opportunities of impoverished students. Therefore, there are two points of hope for the school authorities: (1) Tuition fees should preferably be collected in two installments, and (2) Each school should have at least 20% of the tuition waivers. To date, over 10,000 people have applied to the Loan Committee for loans. Although the Municipal Bank is also providing student loans, the results are still uncertain. In addition, some schools, such as Zhen Dan University, are also providing their own assistance, but the number of loans needed this semester is more than ten times higher than last semester. Therefore, we are now organizing a "National Goods Market" to raise funds. The details will be reported by Chen Ruhui, Director of the Loan Committee.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen stood up and said: Currently, more than 10,000 students have registered for loan applications, requiring a total of 1.5 billion yuan, assuming 150,000 yuan per person. We are now adopting a focus strategy, concentrating our efforts, and jointly organizing a "National Goods Market" with all the student aid organizations in Shanghai. The market will be located at the Sino-French Middle School in Eight Immortals Bridge, and the session will last for five days, from the opening on September 1st to the closing on the 5th. We hope that at least one hundred manufacturers will sponsor by donating items for charity sale or selling them to the Education Loan Committee at the lowest wholesale price, which will then be sold at market price in the market, and the profits will be used as a student loan fund. He also said that the Loan Committee plans to issue 300 million worth of value coupons, which will be promoted to students throughout the city through school principals, hoping to achieve a target of at least 100 million.</p>
<h3>Chairman Pan Delivers an Inspiring Speech: Don't Be Discouraged in Raising Funds, and Hope Everyone Will Awaken Their Conscience</h3>
<p>The chairman then invited Mr. Pan Gongzhan to speak. Mr. Pan's passionate words received several rounds of enthusiastic applause from the entire audience. He briefly stated that the student aid fundraising campaign initiated by Mayor Qian last semester was also held at the International Hotel, and everyone is certainly willing to do their best to continue the effort. From one perspective, the situation on the market is worse now than it was half a year ago, and fundraising seems very difficult. But today, not only should the education sector have a long-term vision, but so should the industrial and commercial sectors. If those of us in this generation do not try every possible way to give the next generation the opportunity to receive education, if we turn a blind eye and have a short-sighted vision, then the future of the country is truly too dangerous. Those of us around the age of forty should not shirk our responsibility and should do our part to enable young people to enter schools. I just heard two students say that the current student aid movement is being done by the young students themselves, which is truly our sorrow. Our ancestors were only afraid that their children would not enter schools, but now young people have to run around themselves to seek the opportunity to attend school, which is truly our shame. Therefore, we must grit our teeth and do our best. We must absolutely not be discouraged or retreat. The target of 1.5 billion, we should make it a 3 billion movement. It may seem very difficult, but in fact, as long as we mobilize all the institutions, all the families, and all the adults, 3 billion is not too much. May I ask, who were the people who rushed to buy things on the market after the exchange rate changed yesterday? They have money, why are they unwilling to take it out? Why have rice prices also risen? Gold prices have also risen? It can be said that this group of people has no conscience and no backbone. If everyone in Shanghai were like this, China would never have hope. We must mobilize all the righteousness in Shanghai to overcome evil and to awaken their conscience. Therefore, this movement is not only a student loan movement, but also a movement of enlightenment. Our current fundraising method is to organize a "National Goods Market." In fact, the national goods industry and commerce have also reached a critical state and can be said to be "sympathizing with each other." Everyone is "poor," and we must call on those who have lost their conscience to donate. I believe that five, ten, or at most one hundred people can solve the problem completely. If all 3.4 million people in Shanghai are poor, and only 50,000 are rich, tell them that they will not be rich for long. Our military and police are not exclusively protecting them, and our Three Principles of the People are not exclusively protecting those upstarts. We must mobilize all the educators, all the gentlemen, and make those who bought foreign goods yesterday, those who bought foreign exchange at the Central Bank, and those who bought American goods on Zhubao 3rd Road take out their money. I believe that as long as we do it with sincerity, we will definitely succeed. Otherwise, if we are prepared to retreat in advance, we will always be the weak, the cowards, and the useless hypocrites.</p>
<p>After Mr. Pan's speech, Hu Boxiang, Tian Heqing, and Wang Wei delivered speeches in succession, elaborating on the significance of organizing the "National Goods Market" to raise student loan funds. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.</p>

<h3>Zhabei "Zengguang" - Partial Restoration of the Water and Electricity Company: Power Supply to Be Officially Resumed Soon</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company was occupied by the enemy during the war, and its machinery and lines were severely damaged over the past eight years. In the months before the victory, it could no longer function normally. After the takeover, the company authorities actively carried out restoration work under extremely scarce material and financial conditions, and have recently completed part of the power generation facilities. They have been busy testing the electricity and have already started supplying users. According to the person in charge of the company, the power supply can be officially restored within half a month at the latest. The person also said that the power test yesterday went very well, and the total load has increased to 4,000 kilowatts, with the company aiming for 5,000 kilowatts. Once the power test is successful, power can be normally supplied to users, reducing the burden on the Shanghai Electric Power Company. However, the current price limit for electricity is too low (73 yuan per kilowatt-hour), resulting in considerable waste by users, which has a significant impact on industrial electricity consumption.</p>
<p>Currently, there are over a hundred factories within the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company's business area that urgently need electricity. With the current daily power generation of 5,000 kilowatts, only one-quarter of the factories can be supplied. The company authorities are currently reapplying to the United Relief Association for a 3 billion yuan loan to repair all permanent power equipment. The company has a total of four turbine engines and seven boilers, but only one turbine engine and two boilers have been repaired. If all of them are repaired, the daily power generation can reach 34,000 kilowatts.</p>
<h3>Four Ruthless Bandits Arrested in a Riverside Shanty</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Zhabei Police Station recently received a tip that several ruthless bandits were hiding in a shanty in Changchun Lane, Changan Road, with another group scattered on boats in the riverside area of Panjiawan, plotting to rob merchants and civilians. Branch Bureau Chief Ying immediately ordered Criminal Division Chief Wang Shoubing to supervise and lead several officers to the address. They successfully captured four bandits: Yu Guangyou, Chen Jiaxi, Liu Zhaocheng, and Liu Yudong, and confiscated two handguns and seven rounds of ammunition. They were then taken back to the branch bureau. According to their confessions, (1) on March 24th, they organized a gang to go to the home of Hua Zhisun at 45 Xi'an Lane, Hongjiang Road</p>
<h3>Jingxing Ship Regularly Sails to Qingdao and Tianjin: Carrying Passengers of the Beihai Ship Heading North</h3>
<p>China Prosperity Company Orders Two Giant Ships That Have Arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The China Prosperity Steamship Company lost eight ocean liners during the war, leaving only one, the Luxing. After the victory, the company resumed operations and strived to restore its fleet. It ordered nine giant ships in the United States, excluding the Haiying and Huaqiang, which are agencies. Seven were self-purchased. Among them, the Qixing and Jingxing have arrived in Shanghai. The Qixing is scheduled to sail to Hankou today. The Jingxing is fulfilling the request of the Relief Administration to carry passengers of the Taikoo Beihai ship, scheduled to sail for the first time on the Qingdao and Tianjin Northern Ocean route on the 29th. Since the ship has no fourth-class facilities, it is currently being added. The remaining ships are said to have set sail from the United States and are expected to arrive in port in late September and October. The Luxing has arrived in Singapore and is expected to arrive in Shanghai in early September, at which time it will be switched to coastal ports.</p>
<p>The Number of Ships Sailing on the Yangtze River Gradually Increases</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Recently, the number of ships sailing on the Yangtze River line has gradually increased.

When the import was declared, it was rejected by the Customs. The American President Line ship General Maggie left Shanghai yesterday at 5:00 PM, bound for Hong Kong. Little Luzon is scheduled to return to Shanghai in early next month and then return to the United States.</p>
<h3>The Murderous Demon King Committed Heinous Crimes: Chang Yuqing, the Traitor, Finally Sentenced to Death: He Trembled and Stared Blankly When He Heard the Sentence</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Following Liang Hongzhi, Cai Pei, and Pan Da, who were sentenced to death, the High Court Criminal Division sentenced the veteran traitor Chang Yuqing to death yesterday morning, depriving him of his civil rights for life, and confiscating all his property except for the necessary living expenses for his family.</p>
<p>Chang is currently 62 years old, from Hubei Province. He used to run a bathhouse in Shanghai and served as the chairman of the dock workers' union. He was an illiterate and ignorant person. During the "January 28th" Shanghai War, he acted as an accomplice and willingly sided with the enemy, leading the enemy's way. Later, he hid in Dalian. When the "August 13th" Shanghai War broke out again and the National Army withdrew westward, he and the enemy Xichuan Osaka and Chuan Xiao'an organized the "Shanghai Maintenance Association." After the association's liberation, it colluded with enemy ruffians Takahashi Inoue and others to organize the "Huangdao Association." It recruited many disciples and specialized in creating terrorist incidents to disrupt people's minds. It once killed patriotic volunteers, cut off their heads, and hung them on telephone poles, causing great panic among the residents who were taking refuge in the concession at that time. Cai Juntu, the president of the Social Evening News, was killed by his subordinates. At that time, he was not only hated by our people, but the concession authorities also offered a reward for his capture in order to eliminate the scourge. However, Chang hid in the New Asia Hotel north of the Suzhou River, protected by the enemy, and nothing could be done. When the puppet National Government was established, Chang went to Nanjing to organize the "Anqing Association." After the victory, he was arrested by our military agency and sent to the court. However, during the trial, Chang flatly denied killing anyone and pretended to be deaf and mute, constantly chanting Amitabha Buddha, claiming that the Huangdao Association and the Anqing Association were charitable organizations. However, the court did not reduce his sentence because of his lies. This murderous demon king who killed countless people was finally sentenced to death.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Chang wore a blue silk robe with團花 patterns, lined with a white silk short shirt and pants, white socks and black shoes. He had a fat head and large ears, a bloated body, and walked unsteadily. His white hair was sparse, and he suffered from severe hearing loss. After the presiding judge read out the main text, it was announced loudly by the bailiff. When Chang heard the sentence, he trembled all over, stared blankly, did not answer a word, and was escorted back to prison by the bailiff.</p>
<h3>Kang Zhuang and Lin Fengxiang, Two Traitors, Each Sentenced to Two and a Half Years of Imprisonment</h3>
<p>On the same day, several other cases were sentenced: (1) Kang Zhuang, the former head of the puppet Pudong Sanlintang Investigation Office, was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment and deprived of his civil rights for two years. (2) Lin Fengxiang, an intelligence agent for the enemy's military police, was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment and deprived of his civil rights for three years. (3) Gao Xiaoxian, Fan Huanxin, Chen Shuqing, and Gao Tangshi, who were accused of collaborating with the enemy due to housing disputes, were acquitted for lack of evidence. Zhou Weixin and Wang Shulin were transferred to the district court for trial.</p>
<h3>Pan Yangyao's Trial Concluded: Sentencing on the 28th</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Pan Yangyao, the former secretary of the Four Banks Savings Association, was accused of serving as the chairman of "Yongfeng Bank" in Shanghai during the enemy and puppet period. The bank was suspected of having traitorous capital and of hoarding and disrupting the financial market. He was also suspected of publishing articles in the puppet newspapers that praised the enemy. The High Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution against him for the crime of treason. The case was tried again yesterday morning. Pan claimed that Yongfeng was a commercial bank organized by purely industrial and commercial figures and had no actions of collaborating with the enemy. He said that he had published articles in the puppet newspapers in a state of unrestrained passion under the circumstances, and ventured to voice his opinions. He did not expect that they would be quoted out of context and thus convicted, which was very painful. The debate on the case has ended, and the sentencing is scheduled for 9:30 AM on the 28th.</p>
<p>On the same day, the trials of Huang Xianggu, the puppet Wuxi County Magistrate and the puppet Director of the Social Savings Insurance Bureau, were concluded, and the sentencing is scheduled for the 27th. The sentencing of Sun Yaodong, the puppet General Manager of the Fuxing Bank, is scheduled for the 26th.</p>
<p>Also, the cases of Liu Zhenhua, a specialist in the secretarial office of the puppet Central Political Committee, and Zhu Shihao, a supervisor of the puppet 13th Division, were adjourned for further questioning after the initial inquiry due to attempted robbery and shooting of the victim. (2) In June, they hired a boat to sail to Beixinjing to intercept and rob merchant ships, stealing a large number of cloths and clothes. (3) In the same month, they intercepted a cargo truck on the Jielu in the North Railway Station area, robbing 24 pieces of派立司 on the spot. They confessed to the facts without reservation. The investigation of the case has been completed, and the suspects have been transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for prosecution.</p>

<h3>National Tongji University Expands the Colleges of Arts and Law: Most Department Heads are First-Class Scholars</h3>
<p>National Tongji University relocated several times during the War of Resistance. After the victory, it actively prepared to return to Shanghai. According to Mr. Dong Xifan, the newly appointed president, Tongji University originally had three colleges: Medicine, Engineering, and Science. Now, a Law School has been added, establishing a Law Department, and the College of Science has been expanded into a College of Arts and Sciences, adding departments of Philosophy, Chinese Literature, and Foreign Languages in addition to the existing departments of the College of Science. The three deans of Academic Affairs, General Affairs, and Student Affairs, as well as the deans of each college and the heads of departments, have recently been mostly appointed. Many new professors have been hired, some of whom have taught for many years at well-known universities in China, while others have taught at foreign universities or worked in factories or research institutions for many years.

<h3>Authorities Determined to Stablize Prices Completely, Market Phenomena Gradually Calming Down, Food Rice Reserves Abundant, Supplied and Sold as Much as Possible, Stores Deliberately Raising Prices Will Be Punished According to Law</h3>
<p>The government implemented adjustments to foreign exchange rates. Mayor Wu earnestly stated to the business community that the prices of various daily necessities should not be raised due to the revised exchange rates. In particular, the city's food reserves are abundant, and the bulk foreign rice ordered is continuously arriving in Shanghai. The government has a firm grasp on ensuring sufficient supply to meet market needs. Mayor Wu specifically met with reporters yesterday morning to reiterate the determination to stabilize prices, hoping that citizens would not easily believe rumors and disturb each other. It is claimed that after the adjustment of foreign exchange rates, there were many rumors in the rice market yesterday, such as refusing to sell or raising prices. According to confirmed investigations, only two rice shops in Caojiadu and Xujiahui exceeded the negotiated price, selling at 66,000 yuan per stone. This was immediately stopped. The remaining rice shops did not refuse to sell or raise prices. On the 19th, the government sold 11,000 stones of Brazilian rice, and on the 20th, it continued to sell large quantities of Brazilian rice and Annam rice. Regarding the soaring sugar prices, responsible persons of the Sugar Industry Association were summoned and warned at 3:00 PM on the 20th. If they did not comply, the police bureau would be ordered to crack down. The prices of cloth and fuel have not increased due to the revised foreign exchange rates, and the situation is still good. Prices of various goods have fluctuated slightly in the past two days, which is a temporary phenomenon. In a few days, it will inevitably stabilize. If prices continue to soar, the government will take measures to suppress them, as it is its responsibility. However, it is hoped that the business community will cooperate with the government to maintain the market.</p>
<p>Central Bank Control··Gold Prices Continue to Fall</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Central Bank continued to control the market. The opening price fell to 2.26 million. After opening, supply continued to exceed demand. Various parties gradually felt that the pressure was too great and became hesitant. The price gradually declined, and buyers gradually gave up. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 97 registered items at a price of 2.17 million. At this time, it was forced to retreat to 2.17 million. Due to the extremely bad situation, investors took the opportunity to absorb it. After the low price, it gradually stabilized, and scattered buyers came one after another. At noon, it rose back to 2.21 million before leveling off again. In the afternoon, the situation was stable because the US dollar was stable. The trend has become a thing of the past, and the entry and exit prices are very close. As a result, it fell by 145,000. Jewelry was lowered to 33,500. Bar silver and silver dollars remained unchanged. The informal short-term interest rate was balanced, and the interest rate ranged from 1.05 to 1.4.</p>
<p>The US Dollar Market is Mild··A Slight Increase of Ten Yuan Compared to Before</p>
<p>Foreign currencies fell with the gold market, but the setbacks were limited because the pressure was indirect. The US dollar opened at 3,800 yuan in the morning and hovered downward. The high price failed to cross the 3,400 yuan mark, and the low price failed to break 3,300 yuan. The situation eased, and the buying and selling spreads were greatly reduced. In the end, the US dollar was still listed at 3,350 yuan, and many people bought and stored it. Near noon, it once rose to more than 3,400 yuan. At noon, it was around 3,390 yuan. The afternoon was stable, struggling around 3,400 yuan. Experts in the Bund frequently absorbed it. As a result, it rose slightly by ten yuan compared to the previous closing. The difference in price from gold was reduced to within 645 yuan per ten taels. Hong Kong notes were very uneasy, resulting in a small fall of twenty yuan. The British exchange rate was 11,500 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 870 yuan, and the Hong Kong exchange rate was 700 yuan. There were sellers in all of them. The US exchange rate is still listed and can be traded against.</p>
<h3>The Exchange Rate Between the Taiwan Dollar and the Legal Tender Does Not Need to Be Changed, Still One to Thirty</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City News] The Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Pei Tsu-yi, told our reporter yesterday that the news that the exchange rate between the Taiwan dollar and the legal tender has been changed from one to thirty to one to forty has not yet been officially reported. However, he has reported the matter to President Song. President Song believes that Taiwan Province is one of the domestic provinces, and both the Taiwan dollar and the legal tender are domestic currencies and have nothing to do with the revision of the foreign exchange rate. He has telegraphed Taiwan Province Chief Chen, asking him to continue to follow the regulations and maintain the rate of one to thirty without any changes.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Continue to Decline Slightly</h3>

<h3>Reinstated Native Banks Transformed into Money Exchange Business</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The original deadline for banks and native banks applying for reinstatement before the war was July 15. After the expiration date, applications from those in this port who had not submitted their applications were not accepted. However, it is heard that the Ministry will still accept such documents until the end of this month, considering the great inconvenience of transportation in various places. Since the restrictions on the reinstatement of this type of bank are very strict, it is not easy to obtain approval from the Ministry. To break the deadlock, the industry applied to change to operate as a money exchange, which is said to have been approved by the Ministry.</p>
<h3>Grain Examination Committee Resolves to Maintain Rice Prices, Large Quantities of Foreign Rice Distributed in the Market, If Unable to Purchase, Can Be Reported</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market, although new goods were available early, medium-grade rice has not yet been harvested, and old goods are gradually scarce due to time constraints, so the source of grain for each grain is not much. Japonica rice still dominates the market. Baiyuan and Yinyuan were originally fancy varieties and had no formal market price. They continued to rise. Yesterday, the Grain Price Examination Committee decided to maintain the original status of the city's rice quantity and price. Mr. Jimingzhai himself went to the North and South markets to inspect the rice market and decided to sell 25,040 bags of Brazilian foreign indica rice (100 pounds per bag) and 12,550 bags of Saigon No. 2 (1.25 stones per bag). The retail price is set at no more than 59,000 yuan per stone for foreign indica rice and 48,000 yuan for Saigon rice. Mr. Ji said that rice prices rising is completely unreasonable. If necessary, he plans to implement a universal allocation system and said that the foreign indica rice sold today can offset white japonica rice. If citizens cannot purchase it, they can report it to the authorities. Yesterday's rice arrivals were 2,179 stones in the South Market and 3,569 stones in the North Market.</p>
<h3>Bank Foreign Currency Deposits</h3>
<p>Transferred to the Central Bank at the End of September</p>

Medium grades fell by five to six hundred yuan to one thousand yuan. The Yongbang picking was also loosening. The North still selected white wheat and there were some transactions. High-grade goods were still stable. Soybeans were slack, and old goods fell by a thousand yuan due to the oil mill's expectations. Raw peanuts, Guangbang continued to process, rising by a thousand yuan. Medium grades of yellow ramie were rarely accepted, falling by one to two thousand yuan. After the oil market opened, selling pressure was strong, and stores were hesitant to buy. Raw oil and soybean oil fell sharply by three to four thousand yuan. Rapeseed oil also became tired. Bean cake fell by one to two hundred yuan.</p>
<h3>Adjusted US Dollar Exchange Rate Against China</h3>

<h3>Unrelated to Foreign Exchange, Taiwan Sugar Still Sells for 70,000 Yuan, It is Rumored that the Allocation Method Will Be Improved, The Authorities Have Strictly Prohibited the Black Market</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Yesterday, the person in charge of Taiwan Sugar Company, Song Yixin, told our reporter that the government's adjustment of the foreign exchange rate will not have any impact on the sugar allocated by Taiwan Sugar Company. Taiwan Sugar Company will allocate sugar at the original price (70,000 yuan per dan). In addition, Taiwan Sugar Company has recently gained full confidence in the issue of transporting Taiwan sugar to Shanghai. In the future, it is expected to arrive continuously and supply at low prices as much as possible.</p>
<p>It is reported that a total of 25,640 bags of the tenth batch of sugar have been allocated to sugar dealers and others to meet the needs of foreign ports. The allocation price remains the same, and the goods can be shipped today. The application deadline for the eleventh batch of sugar is this Friday. In the future, the method of allocating sugar is being discussed by the Social Bureau and the Taiwan Sugar Company to improve it. It is heard that in order to facilitate citizens to buy sugar, the time for each Nanhua store to sell parity sugar will be extended, from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. The allocation method may use the Baojia system to implement allocation based on population.</p>
<p>In addition, the Taiwan Sugar Company shipped a large batch of sugar from Taiwan yesterday by the Zhongkai and Haiyu ships. The Zhongkai ship loaded 1,900 tons, and the Haiyu ship loaded 6,580 tons, which are currently being unloaded.</p>
<p>The allocation price, retail price, and retail price of Taiwan sugar are all regulated by the Social Bureau and the company and have not changed. However, the black market price has been raised to more than 100,000 yuan. It is heard that the municipal authorities are extremely angry and have summoned the responsible persons of the industry for a rebuke. At the same time, they have secretly sent officers to investigate thoroughly. If the facts are found, they will be dealt with severely.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Price Falls Back, Transactions Begin · Cotton Cloth Actual Sales Stagnant, Market Conditions Calm ·</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market initially fell and then strengthened. In the morning, dealers, due to the previous day's Textile Construction's fair price listing, and hearing that major factories, following the mayor's intentions, were likely to supply at lower prices, the opening price of Shuang Ma spot goods suddenly dropped to 1.43 million, a huge drop of 180,000 compared to yesterday. Soon after, Guangdong merchants seized the opportunity to buy up the cheap spot goods, and by the close of the market, the Shuang Ma spot price had risen to 1.5 million. However, the Shuang Ma warehouse receipts offered by Shenxin Yarn Factory were actually only 1.35 million. The prices of other yarns all fell by about 100,000 compared to the previous day. Transactions began, and both dealers and customers were eager to buy, so confidence was quite strong. It was also reported that Datong Yarn Factory offered Dafieting yarn at 1.15 million, Yong'an Yarn Factory offered Te Jin Cheng yarn at 1.26 million, and Anda, Dazhong, Shen, Santong, Yisheng, and other factories also had considerable allocations, but unfortunately, the amount supplied was very small.</p>
<p>The cloth market continued to decline in the morning due to stagnant actual sales and a sharp drop in gold prices, leading to even more anxiety among speculators. At the same time, given that the Textile Construction Company's cotton yarn price list released the previous day had not increased, it was expected that cloth prices would certainly not rise, so confidence was only so-so. The decline in Si Junzi serge was more pronounced. Indigo cloth was constrained by dyes, and transactions were rare. At noon, Textile Construction, as usual, released its price list, with both Caiqiu and Wufu fine cloths priced the same as at the end of the week. Traders considered the prices quite low and competed to buy. The market was relatively calm in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Sudden Rise · Sudden Fall, Stock Market Sentiment Uneasy</h3>
<p>A new panic arose in Chinese stocks. Some who were involved in the gold market suffered losses. There were sudden sell-offs at the opening. Yong'an Yarn opened at 700 yuan, but only found buyers at 670 yuan. Meiya was no exception and was also dragged down slightly. The market for the less popular small and medium-sized stocks was quiet, with no one inquiring. Initially, the market was extremely dull, but as the popular stocks continued to decline, some finally resorted to selling off at reduced prices, with some slight rebounds. The popular stocks initially showed a slight rise from their lows, but the upward trend was short-lived and soon stabilized. Major players had no interest and sought to close out their positions. Sellers dominated the market, and prices soon fell again. Prices retreated to lows near noon, then rebounded slightly. The situation deteriorated day by day, and the closing prices were much lower than the previous day. Yong'an Yarn fell by more than 10%, Meiya, Jingfu, and Xinguang each fell by more than 15%, and Qinxing fell by more than 20%. The less popular small and medium-sized stocks also fell by 10% to 20%. Old stocks also fell by about 0.5%.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks, influenced by gold and currency fluctuations, all plummeted. Yisheng Yarn opened at 10,000 yuan and only then had any trades. British Union also fell to 10,400 yuan. Other stocks were also dragged down. Bulls rushed to sell, creating an oversupply. Speculators trampled each other overnight, and the stock prices fell dramatically. However, Western merchants absorbed some at lower prices, but their numbers were small and had little effect. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yisheng Yarn, British Union, Jardine Matheson, Asia, Paper, Yisheng Beer, and Steel all fell by 15% to 20%, while Yeguang fell by slightly more than 10%.</p>
<p>Liquid Fuels</p>
<p>The three gasoline companies all set the price at 740 yuan per gallon. Kerosene was quoted at 15,000 yuan per 5-gallon can the day before yesterday. However, in the afternoon, seeing that the three companies showed no signs of raising prices, the price fell back to 11,000 yuan. Yesterday morning, buying interest was stronger, and Mobil and Asia were priced at 13,000 yuan per can. However, because supply was unlimited, foreign companies were unmoved, and the market price was difficult to stabilize and quickly fell. The bulk price of diesel rose from 230,000 to 330,000 per ton, with some sellers asking for 360,000 yuan, but there were no transactions. Buyers and sellers alike were watching the movements of the three foreign companies.</p>
<p>Chemical Raw Materials</p>
<p>The opening prices of the previous morning varied. Caustic soda was initially quoted at 600,000 yuan per barrel, but fell back to 500,000 yuan by noon. There were no formal price quotes at 4:00 PM. Prices for all items were increased by 50% to 60% according to the exchange rate, but there were no transactions. Yesterday morning, most opening prices returned to Saturday's levels. However, ammonium chloride fell by 200,000 yuan per ton. Caustic soda was quoted at 520,000 yuan per barrel by some, but others asked for 450,000 yuan. However, industrial raw materials were oversupplied, and it was difficult to expect any improvement.</p>
<h3>London Chinese Bonds Improve After Depreciation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] The London foreign public bond market was very quiet today. There were buyers of Chinese bonds, believing that the depreciation of Chinese legal tender might be a stabilizing factor.</p>
<h3>Bleached Tung Oil Exports Hopeful, Morale Boosted</h3>
<p>Bleached tung oil exports have been stalled for two months, with no way to expand, relying solely on domestic sales. As the summer selling season nears its end, the market has been extremely quiet. The recent changes in foreign exchange rates could provide significant support for export goods, so market sentiment is extremely boosted, but foreign trade has not yet begun, so prices cannot be assessed. However, domestic sales are currently priced between 105,000 and 110,000 yuan, but sales are minimal, only serving to decorate the market.</p>
<p>Although Hongjiang tung oil is only for domestic sales, the cost is naturally also increased due to raw material prices. However, with the summer selling season ending, it is uncertain whether the selling price can be raised.</p>
<h3>Egyptian New Cotton Government Buys All</h3>

<h3>Latest US Invention Non-Freezing Glass</h3>
<p>[US News Service, New York, 19th] A US glass manufacturer recently announced the invention of a new type of glass pane. Airplane windows using this glass will not freeze, inside or out. Its name is "Nesa," and it consists of a layer of transparent conductor applied to ordinary glass.

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 20th] Most of the United States' general foreign trade has already been returned to private businesses. However, the Department of Commerce believes that a portion of bulk purchases will continue to be managed by government agents. In addition to the large-scale purchase of Far Eastern rubber and Cuban sugar, the department also listed other government purchase plans, including Chilean copper, Bolivian tin, lead, sugar cane, alcohol, rope, fiber, corundum, wood, and quinine bark.</p>

<h3>Sugar Merchants Watch and Wait</h3>
<p>After rising due to foreign exchange fluctuations the day before yesterday, the sugar market returned to normal yesterday. Medium sugar broke the 150,000 mark, falling by more than 10,000 yuan. Other sugars also eased. But most are still holding a wait-and-see attitude, so there were not many transactions. Only Guangdong merchants opened at 160,000 yuan for tribute powder, 7,000 to 8,000 yuan lower for small sugar, and 140,000 yuan for Xingchi, with more than 80 baskets traded. Shantou merchants quoted a 5,000 yuan increase and cotton sugar was quoted at 145,000 yuan, but there were no transactions.</p>

<h3>Focus of Disaster Relief in Hunan Province</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Gao Yuanli, Changsha Dispatch, This Newspaper, 11th</p>
<p>Southern Hunan is a severely disaster-stricken area, with the most serious damage, the largest affected area, and the most types of disasters. More than a million people have starved to death, and millions have been displaced. There are still more than ten million people groaning on the line of hunger and death. The honest, resilient, and straightforward people of Hunan are all loyal. They never complain or protest much. We should give more sympathy and assistance to these suffering people who are not good at speaking and do not want to speak.</p>
<p>War Disasters Surpass All Provinces</p>
<p>The unprecedented fire of 1938 burned hundreds of thousands of Hunanese people, leaving them homeless, and the essence of Hunan was reduced to ashes. There were four Battles of Changsha, two Battles of Southern Hunan, two Battles of Western Hunan, and one major Battle of Hengyang. In 1938, Linxiang and Yueyang fell, and enemy cavalry harassed the area. The enemy and our armies confronted each other across the river, pressing forward and retreating repeatedly. The area north of Hunan has become a ruin. In the Zhichangtao Battle, the granary of Dongting was completely destroyed. The Jianjiao Battle resulted in fields filled with corpses. In the summer of 1944, the enemy captured Changsha and advanced to Hengyang, then deepened along the Xiang-Gui Railway. After Guilin and Liuzhou fell, the enemy turned east, crossing the Yuehan Railway from the Xiang-Gui Railway, and entered Guangdong Province. The tragedy of 300,000 people being raped, looted, killed, and burned was unprecedented. Later, they retreated from Guilin into Hunan, burning and looting even more severely. In the eight years since the war began, Hunan has suffered the most, and the disaster area is the largest, reaching 54 counties and cities. The extent of war damage surpasses all other provinces in the country.</p>
<p>Natural Disasters Come Frequently</p>
<p>In 1945, all 76 counties in the province suffered from drought. Anxiang, Lixian, Changde, Yuanjiang, and other counties suffered from floods. Taoyuan, Anhua, and other counties suffered from insect infestations. Various prevalent epidemics in the counties, such as malignant malaria, cholera, typhoid, meningitis, and smallpox, combined with other diseases, resulting in successive deaths. Rural areas were bankrupt, and people were unable to make a living. Dangerous situations arose one after another, making it unbearable to describe. The above are all disasters that are well known to the outside world. Other successive disasters have been ignored by the outside world. "If they don't die, we don't care." However, disaster and Hunan have long been inextricably linked. During the Anti-Japanese War, there was no time without disaster, and no county without disaster. Perhaps it's "too many debts to repay" and "too many lice to bite." People are accustomed to seeing them, and the government is accustomed to hearing about them, so they are often left unresolved. However, no matter what, the simple and resilient people have a certain limit to their suffering. Once that limit is exceeded, in simple terms, it is a summation of death, which is also the destruction of everything. Can we watch Hunan sink so deeply?</p>
<p>We can see many things about the disaster situation in various places and their relief work from the Hunan Branch of the Good Rescue General Administration. The following is a realistic description of the disaster situation and relief efforts in Hunan.</p>
<p>Tragic Disaster Situation</p>
<p>The disaster area covers 52 counties and the two cities of Changsha and Hengyang, with an area of 500,000 square li, accounting for 70% of the province's area. The people in the occupied area reach more than 21 million, accounting for more than 75% of the province's population. (1) The population deaths are 577,527 people. (2) The number of injured and sick people in the province is 1,676,212. (4) The housing loss is more than 945,000 buildings, estimated at 22,905 billion yuan. (5) The grain loss is 40.068 million dan, valued at 214.8 billion yuan. (6) The loss of cattle is 640,000 heads, valued at 50 billion yuan. (7) The loss of tools and clothing is estimated at 426 billion yuan. (8) Other various losses are 461.5 billion yuan. (The above figures are all estimated in 1945. If calculated at the current value, it will be more than these numbers.)</p>
<p>Relief Work</p>
<p>(1) Sending back refugees: Changsha, Hengyang, Shaoyang, Yueyang, Lingling, Yuanling, Changde, Anjiang, Chenxian, and other nine refugee service centers sent a total of 249,000 refugees from November 1945 to the end of July 1946. (2) Allocating disaster relief: As of the end of July this year, Changsha, Hengyang, Yueyang, and other 52 cities and counties had issued a total of 57 million yuan in relief funds. (3) Producing and distributing winter clothing and quilts: At the beginning of the establishment of the Hunan Branch, it was winter, and the weather was very cold. However, the victims had no clothes or quilts and were waiting for relief. The Branch had produced more than 36,000 cotton clothes and distributed them to 54 counties and cities, totaling more than 40 million yuan. The refugee service centers in Changsha, Hengyang, and Shaoyang were also given 10 million yuan to produce cotton coats specifically for distributing to refugees in transit. In addition, 1,600 cotton quilts were rushed to be produced at the Anjiang No. 1 Cotton Mill and distributed to various refugee centers for use. (4) Porridge and flour distribution centers: Starting on January 9, 1946, four porridge distribution centers in Changsha, six in Weiyang, two each in Lingling, Xiangyin, and Yueyang, and one each in Jieshan, Dong'an, Qiyang, and Linxiang, were opened one after another, accommodating a total of 11,000 victims, with remarkable results. Prominent figures praised them repeatedly. By the end of May this year, various porridge distribution centers had been converted into flour distribution centers. In addition to the original centers, Changning, Hengyang, and other seven centers were added, accommodating a total of 50,000 victims, distributing more than 1,000 tons of flour and 12 million yuan in non-staple food expenses. (5) Emergency relief work teams: In May, a total of 22 work teams were dispatched to 22 counties and cities with more serious disaster situations, such as Changsha, to distribute flour and provide relief to 90,000 victims, distributing a total of 2.98 million catties of flour. This was the first phase. From June to July, more than 153 work teams were dispatched in succession, providing relief to a total of 2,020,000 victims, distributing a total of 30 million catties of soybean flour and wheat flour. A total of 33 million catties were distributed before and after. (6) Fire disaster relief: Relief was issued to Linxiang, Huarong, Changsha, Hanshou, and other counties. (7) Distribution of Guangdong rice: The first shipment of 10 tons of rice to Hengyang was directly distributed to the victims in various counties. The second shipment was 10 tons, and the third shipment was 67 tons.</p>
<p>Agricultural Loans and Industrial Loans</p>
<p>(8) Agricultural relief: 1. Cattle farming loans totaled 140 million yuan and 100 tons of flour. 2. Emergency agricultural loans: the first phase was 140 million yuan, the second phase was 70 million yuan, and the third phase was 1.088 billion yuan. Small-scale farmland water conservancy loans were 25 million yuan, and pond and dam loans were 500 million yuan. (9) Seed and fertilizer loans: A total of 168.8 million yuan in fertilizer loans and 86 million yuan in seed loans were issued to 44 counties and cities. (10) Industrial relief: The ones currently under construction are the Lingdao Highway, the Lingdong Road, and the Shaoxin Road. The Hengchang Road is being surveyed. In May and June, 6.24 million catties of flour were issued for industrial relief, providing relief to 410,000 victims. (11) Civilian housing and small school buildings: A total of 432 million yuan was issued for civilian housing and 133 million yuan for small school buildings. (12) Good Rescue Factories: Currently, there are four factories that can produce goods, engaging in sewing, weaving, embroidery, cigarette rolling, printing, knitting, and other businesses. (13) Repairing dikes and embankments and subsidizing the repair of dikes and embankments in various counties by 14 million yuan, and allocating 2,300 tons of flour. 360 tons of flour have been issued for ponds and dams, and loans of 500 million yuan have been issued. (14) Industrial and mining loans and small industrial loans: Cotton spinning industry has the most industrial and mining loans. Small industrial loans have reached 50 million yuan. (15) Subsidizing the construction costs of various hospitals: A total of 180 million yuan was issued to 15 units. There are many other relief efforts that cannot be listed one by one.</p>
<p>Focus on Industrial Relief</p>
<p>From the above figures, we can see the progress of relief in Hunan. Although such efforts have been made, the disaster situation is still quite severe. The emergency relief work led by the Branch, in coordination with the autumn harvest, is coming to an end. The focus in the future will shift to industrial relief in order to do preliminary post-disaster work. It is necessary to use international forces to revitalize Hunan's industry, mining, transportation, farmland water conservancy, and other work so that the broken rural areas can have hope of recovery and prosperity. The entire plan has been drafted by the Branch and will be announced soon.</p>

<h3>Visiting Ms. Wu Yifang</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Fourteenth Day Nanjing Dispatch, Resident Beijing Reporter Zhang Ming</p>
<p>It was already time for dinner, the splendor of the fierce sun slightly diminished, sweeping across the lonely grassland. On this verdant expanse stood a red-brick palace-style building. Before interviewing the main figure—Principal Wu Yifang—the reporter first made a solitary visit.</p>
<p>You naturally wouldn't believe that the emerald-green grass was already dotted with many tall weeds. Behind the building, clumps of creeping vines grew profusely! The house, from the outside, was magnificent enough, but today, it was painted with a hue of decline. However, in a building used as faculty housing, I saw some allied female professors sitting on cushioned chairs, idly chatting about the weather. They were all very gentle, very simple, with an air of religion permeating the space. Of the entire large courtyard, only this corner was filled with the breath of human activity.</p>
<p>Female Doctor With Both Talent and Learning</p>
<p>In another building, the reporter waited for Principal Wu. In the past, I had met her, but today I came to interview her with the intention of "getting to know" her, so I had an idea of her overall character.</p>
<p>I knew that she was fifty-two years old, that she was from Hangzhou, that she had a Master's and a Doctorate from the University of Michigan in the United States, that she was an educator—having served as a university president for fifteen years—and that she was also a politician—having served as a member of the National Political Council for eight years.</p>
<p>Walking from the office into the reception room, her height was not short, her physique sturdy, her hair neatly styled in a knot, her ever-present nearsighted glasses on, and wearing a light blue striped cloth cheongsam with low-heeled black leather shoes, no matter how you looked at it, she gave people the immediate impression that she was an educator with both talent and learning. She was very busy, and as soon as she came in, she said, "I've kept you waiting too long, I'm very sorry."</p>
<p>"I know this is a very inconvenient time," the reporter said uneasily.</p>
<p>"Because there are several letters that must be sent out quickly," she said.</p>
<p>"Is it about the enrollment exams?"</p>
<p>"No," and so this question prompted her to speak about the entirety of the school's transformation over the past eight years.</p>
<p>The Difficulty of Post-War Reconstruction</p>
<p>She said that the school's reconstruction was not easy. Just considering the repairs, a few days ago, the repair costs for one dormitory alone amounted to seven million, barely enough to make it habitable. There were a total of four dormitories, and so many other school buildings that were not yet repaired. But she said that the most important thing was to start with the desks and chairs essential for teaching, because the desks had already been stolen. Not having desks was the foremost condition that made classes impossible. The books had also been scattered and lost. During the chaotic transitional period after Japan's surrender and before we took over the administration, many had been stolen, but fortunately, most have now been recovered. This is a great fortune amid misfortune. Speaking of pianos, there were more than twenty before the war, but by the time of the takeover, there were only two left. Now, after exhausting all efforts to buy two in Shanghai, it cost more than three million, but Principal Wu is determined to seek every convenience in teaching. Pianos are essential teaching tools for the music department.</p>
<p>She told me, as if recalling memories, that the buildings were exquisitely constructed, entirely reflecting the founder's view of American education, believing that studying required a good environment and comfortable living quarters, as well as a long-term plan. As a result, although the building had been occupied by the Japanese for eight years, apart from being damaged, there was no other harm or destruction. Then she continued to explain her views on education to the reporter.</p>
<p>Talking About Academic Achievements</p>
<p>When the reporter inquired about her academic life, she always humbly said nothing. She said: I don't have a biography, and others can't write one for me, because writing one now would be too early. She avoided talking about many experiences. Unable to get around this, the reporter had to slowly chat with her casually, like chatting about the weather.</p>
<p>She said that although she was from Hangzhou, her father was from Taixian, Jiangsu. She was born in Wuchang and went to school in Hangzhou, so her childhood was spent traveling on life's journey. The two schools she attended in China were both, strangely enough, newly established schools: one was the Hangzhou Public Girls' School, which was established by the so-called reformist gentry in Hangzhou. When she entered this school, she was already eleven years old. Although it was elementary school level, everyone who entered this school had a serious attitude towards learning, so the atmosphere of academic research within the school was extremely good. The school's main aim was also to promote women's work, not to hope that women would be toys. At the time, this new trend of thought was highly respected. Principal Wu studied there for three years under this spirit. Later, she went to many middle schools, such as Suzhou Jinghai and Hangzhou Hongdao. She was a top student, but she didn't get a diploma from any of them. Finally, she entered university, which is also the school she now leads, Jinling Women's University. When she entered, the school was just beginning to be established. Most of the students who entered Jinling Women's University at this time had worked in society for a period of time. She also had to go to work in society after middle school because her parents had passed away one after the other, because not only did she have no one to pay her tuition, but she also had a younger sister who needed education. During this period, she worked for two years, but she, who loved to learn tirelessly, always felt the bitterness of insufficient schooling, so she applied to Jinling Women's University to study, and later the church sent her to the University of Michigan in the United States to study. She was always diligent and hard-working, and her achievements were outstanding. The church was a great force in her academic achievements, and she herself also had a spirit of tirelessly teaching people, so her leading Jinling Women's University is the most appropriate job, and it can also be said to be the most suitable career. Yes, in her plan, the future of Jinling Women's University is limitless.</p>
<p>Emphasizing Practice, Not Forgetting Politics</p>
<p>Her participation in political affairs began with the National Political Council in the second year of the Anti-Japanese War, but she didn't have the ability and opportunity to organize and lead at that time. In 1933, the World Women's Conference was held in Chicago, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs selected university professors such as Yan Yangchu to go. Principal Wu also attended at that time. In 1935, she was elected as the chairman of the executive committee of the National Christian Council of China. Before this, she attended the Pacific Science Congress three times, in 1929, 1931, and 1933. Although this was a private academic society, Principal Wu's achievements were not small. However, in these many opportunities, she worked hard in the church and in education. Only last year was she officially sent by the government to attend the San Francisco Conference as a member. She also gained unlimited honors in the United States. Miees University gave honorary doctorates to the five female representatives who attended the conference. At the degree ceremony, Principal Wu was praised as the most prestigious one, so in the photo, she was standing in the center. When she attended the National Political Council as a member of the presidium, she was so composed, so organized. At that time, some people who were unfamiliar with the education field thought that her overnight success was due to some other simple reasons, or because she was a woman. In fact, her achievement was a natural result of her efforts. Moreover, after she achieved success in certain areas, she still never forgot her great plan for the long-term cultivation of talent. She tirelessly buried herself in the president's office of Jinling Women's University, constantly designing for the future of the school, and serving as a role model for the students.</p>

<h3>Half a Month in Yangzhou</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Sixteenth Yangzhou Dispatch, Special Correspondent Wang Gonghan</p>
<p>Not long ago, the entire situation in northern Jiangsu, after the National Army counterattacked the Communist Army on all fronts and repeatedly achieved progress, temporarily excited everyone. However, in the last two days, although the news in the newspapers remains quiet, the displaced people seem to have gained new comfort in their hearts. They firmly believe that they will eventually return to their hometowns one day.</p>
<h3>Pacification of the Countryside, Commercial Improvement</h3>
<p>Secondly, speaking of Yangzhou County, the Communist Army in the countryside has almost been completely driven out of the entire county. Only the territory under the jurisdiction of the seventh district in this township and the territory under the jurisdiction of the ninth district in the northern township are still partly in the hands of the Communist Army. The "Yangtai Highway" (Yangzhou to Taizhou), which has been repeatedly cut off by the Communist forces, is indeed completely under the control of the National Army. The "Yi-Yi" (Yangzhou to Yizheng County) and "Yangtian" (Yangzhou to Tianchang County) highways have also been opened by the National Army one after another. This development has had a great impact on Yangzhou. The most obvious impact, of course, is on the Jiangdu County administration, which will no longer be confined to the corner of the city. As for the impact on commerce, someone has estimated that if it weren't for the National Army, at least one-third of the formal shops in Yangzhou would have gone bankrupt by the Mid-Autumn Festival, which was almost certain. Stores like Nanhuo shops, grocery stores, Wuyang shops, and cloth shops have all seen more business than before. Shopkeepers in the towns are gradually coming to the city to buy goods.</p>
<h3>Bountiful Autumn Harvest, Rice Prices Suddenly Fall</h3>
<p>Around the tenth of this month, when the late rice in the fields was blooming and bearing fruit, which is when it needs rain the most, the heavens seemed to be helping out specially, sending down several waves of timely rain. That day, the reporter was getting a haircut in a barber shop and heard the barbers chatting, saying, "This rain is simply gold!" "This year's early and late rice harvests will be great!" "The northwest countryside will probably be even better..." After that, the next day, the reporter heard that rice prices had fallen. The day before yesterday (the eleventh), the best white rice fell from more than 50,000 yuan to more than 30,000 yuan, and coarser rice even fell to more than 20,000 yuan. Yesterday, according to a survey, ordinary medium-grade new rice was only 31,000 to 32,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Threat of Man-Made Flood Has Not Been Eliminated</h3>
<p>People can't help but be happy! However, in addition to these happy things, people are constantly worried about another major event, which is not war, nor famine, but a man-made flood!</p>
<p>Since the Communist Army breached the Hongze Lake dam, people here have been paying attention to it, paying more attention to it than to any national or world event. Because everyone over the age of thirty has suffered from the catastrophic flood of 1931, especially the tragic impression, which is still deeply imprinted in people's minds. When the flood rises, Yangzhou city will generally be safe, but several counties in Lixiahe, such as Taizhou, Xinghua, Dongtai, Gaoyou, Yancheng, etc., will all become a vast marshland. The key to whether this disaster can be avoided or not is in the hands of the Communist Army. Going up the canal from Yangzhou, there are about thirteen dam openings, of which the "Zhaoguan Dam" past Shaobo is the most important. According to rumors, the Communist Army has hollowed out the foundation of the "Zhaoguan Dam", and since then, there has been a threat to breach the Hongze Lake dam. The reporter doesn't believe this rumor is true, but there is no way to prove what the facts are. But even if this rumor is a rumor, it can be imagined how much attention and fear people are paying to the matter!</p>
<h3>The Replay of the Great Flood Tragedy Has More Elements</h3>
<p>Because of this, the reporter specially visited the "Northern Jiangsu Canal Second Cheng Bureau" today and went out of "Fuyun Gate" to take a look. But unexpectedly, the rolling flood has already landed in the last two days when the tide came. This is not much different from the situation of water on the shore near "Fuyun Gate" and "Chaoguan" during the great flood of 1931 in the reporter's memory. It seems that the tragic flood of 1931 has more replay elements and fewer avoidable elements. Because first, the autumn flood has arrived, and second, the work of rushing to repair the canal has lost the proactive nature of preventing problems before they occur. Moreover, according to the "Jiangdu Daily" on the thirteenth, the Northern Jiangsu Canal Public Relief Bureau will be bidding for materials to repair the canal from yesterday to the nineteenth in Zhenjiang. Also, "the newly appointed director of the bureau, Zheng Tonghe, has not yet taken office, and the bureau's affairs must be started after the director takes office." Third, as mentioned earlier, the important dam openings of the canal are under the control of the Communist Army. Strengthening the canal embankment and repairing the canal embankment is one thing, but if the Communist Army ignores everything and desperately breaches two openings in the important places of the canal embankment, it is another matter!</p>
<p>Therefore, the nine exiled county government agencies are even more concerned about this matter. They are preparing to enter their respective counties with the advance of the National Army, and they are preparing almost every day.</p>
<h3>Grand Events of August 15th in Tianjin</h3>
<p>—Sixteenth Tianjin Dispatch, Special Correspondent Li Shaolin</p>
<p>On the morning of "August 15th," national flags were hung in the streets and alleys of Tianjin City, the corners of the flags fluttering in the wind, as if touching everyone's heartstrings. Last year on this day, the news of Japan's surrender spread throughout the world, bringing joy and a bright future to people. Everyone crawled out of the dark air-raid shelters and ran into the sunlight, which was so bright that it made people dizzy. They stood there stunned, their hearts pounding, their thoughts frozen by the jubilation, forgetting the tragedy that had just ended, and not thinking that dark clouds would cover the sun tomorrow, from early winter to severe winter.</p>
<p>After the momentary joy passed, everyone's enthusiasm dropped with the temperature, dropping to several degrees below zero as shown on the thermometer. Although it has been blown by the spring breeze this spring and baked by the hot sun this summer, the frozen hearts of people cannot be warmed up. Looking at the faces of the bustling pedestrians in Tianjin City this year on "August 15th," where can we find the joy of this day last year? The national flags on the street are fluttering in the wind. The corners of the flags seem to be touching everyone's heartstrings.</p>
<h3>Presenting Flags to the National Army, Guardians of the Nation</h3>
<p>Even so, this is still a day worth commemorating. All sectors of Tianjin City held a conference to comfort the Allied and National Armies on this day. The program of the conference ran from morning to late at night. Although there was no more of the hysterical jubilation on everyone's faces and in their conversations, the calm recollection at this time and place was more meaningful for commemoration. Regarding comforting the National Army, the important program was presenting flags and flowers. At ten o'clock in the morning, Han Da, Secretary-General of the Tianjin City Party Department, led the youth league members to hold a flag presentation ceremony in the Tianli Auditorium of the 94th Army Headquarters. After Army Commander Mu Tingfang accepted the brocade flag inscribed with "Guardians of the Nation," he said: "Last year on this day, the whole country was excited, but today there are many obstacles to national construction, and the people are suffering. I hope that next year on this day, we can embark on the road of national construction." His tone was heavy, and the words seemed to jump out of his mouth one by one.</p>
<h3>Golden Alliance, Sino-American Cooperation</h3>
<p>The dinner party to comfort the Allied forces was held at eight o'clock in the afternoon. Lieutenant General Luke, Commander of the U.S. Marine Corps in China, and his subordinates were invited to attend. After the dinner party began, Mayor Zhang Ting'e first presented a brocade flag and a signed commemorative album to Lieutenant General Luke on behalf of all the citizens of Tianjin. In his speech, Mayor Zhang said what many people wanted to say: "Now it has been a year since the victory, but the fruits of victory have not been spread throughout China. Not only has the National Army not been able to rest, but the Allied forces have also not been able to reunite with their long-separated families for the sake of friendly missions. This makes us feel regret in addition to gratitude. However, we believe that China and the world are moving from darkness to light." Lieutenant General Luke said in his reply: "This day last year was won through battle and bloodshed. We must not forget the people who sacrificed for the battle. In this year, everyone has been fighting together to seek real peace, which is more difficult than war. I hope everyone will not be discouraged and will jointly create lasting peace!"</p>
<p>The First Reinforced Division of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Tianjin held a parade at nine o'clock in the morning to commemorate the anniversary of the victory. A total of eight teams of marines, more than seven hundred people, participated in the review. Our people completely filled the stands around the Tianjin People's Park playground. When the review began, the U.S. Marine Corps First Reinforced Division band first played the U.S. national anthem, followed by the Chinese national anthem. The people in the stands, seeing everyone standing up straight inside the field, also stood up. After Lieutenant General Luke inspected the troops and completed the review, the march-past began. Twenty-four Corsair-style planes circled in the sky, the sound of the engines reverberating from the clouds to the ground. The eight teams of marines solemnly walked past the reviewing officer and then returned to their barracks.</p>
<h3>Entertainment Venues Free of Charge to Comfort the Troops</h3>
<p>The fourth dance hall, five movie theaters, and theaters in Tianjin were open from afternoon to late at night, separately comforting the Allied and National Armies free of charge. Not many people went to the movie theaters and theaters, and the result was that the citizens filled the vacancies. The situation in the dance halls was more lively. The organizers of the comfort-the-troops conference specially invited several White Russian dancers to perform dances. The relatively neat Yong'an Dance Hall in Tianjin was dedicated to comforting Allied officers. At eleven o'clock, three White Russian women walked into the dance floor one after another, baring their thighs and twisting their waists to perform their dances. After one performance was completed, there was a burst of applause. In the corner of the room, an American officer was sitting alone. The attendant asked him if he wanted a dance partner. He said that he needed to sit quietly and think. What was he thinking about? On the night of "August 15th," it was raining heavily, and the autumn feeling was deep.</p>
<p>People on the Jiangtai Highway in Northern Jiangsu welcome the military and political leaders who are responsible for the work of comforting the people.</p>

<h3>Answering Readers' Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(I) Rent Increase</p>
<p>Cao Ruigui asks: (1) Whether the second landlord's rent for the third tenant should be collected at 140 times the rate stipulated by the municipal government. I moved in in 1943, and now the second landlord calculates according to the rent at that time. Is this legal? (2) The total rent paid by the second landlord for the entire house was 110 yuan in legal currency in August 1937, and 4,400 yuan in legal currency from November 1945 (three upper and three lower rooms), but the rent collected from the third tenant is only one-sixth, but the rent collected is 12,000 yuan in legal currency. Starting from April of this year, it has increased by 140 times, so the second landlord's rent is 15,400 yuan, but the rent collected from the third tenant for one-sixth of the room has been changed to 42,000 yuan. Is such profiteering proper? (3) To which agency should I apply to sanction this illegal behavior?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] (1) Calculate at 140 times the rent in August 1937. (2) Improper. (3) You can apply to the Shanghai Municipal Housing Rental Management Committee for mediation or sue in court.</p>
<p>(II) Limitation of Redemption Issue</p>
<p>Qian Baodi asks: In September 1939, I mortgaged a land business license, totaling one mu and six fen of land, to a Yao family for 2,000 yuan in legal currency, with interest at 1.5% per month. It has been six years and eight months. Now I have prepared 20,000 yuan to redeem the original certificate, but the Yao family refuses to allow the redemption and does not provide details. How much should I return according to the calculation of principal and interest?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] Reference should be made to the provisions of Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After the Restoration. If it is obviously unfair, the court should make a fair judgment to increase or decrease the payment.</p>
<p>(II) Public Debt Issues</p>
<p>Zhou Jun asks: (1) During the Anti-Japanese War, due to currency inflation and the decline in currency value, can public debt purchasers request the government to repay in silver dollars? Is the Gold Clause of the United States generally applicable in China? (2) During the restoration period, does Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Civil Litigation have the same effect on national debt? (3) After 1941, the issued U.S. dollar public debt had a face value of 10,000 U.S. dollars. At that time, the exchange rate between China and the United States was 100 yuan in national currency for 5.3125 U.S. dollars, that is, 1 U.S. dollar for 20 yuan in legal currency. People subscribed at this exchange rate. Recently, the exchange rate has been 2,000 yuan in national currency for 1 U.S. dollar. The government repays this debt at the latest exchange rate, and does not repay at the exchange rate of 20 yuan in national currency for 1 U.S. dollar. Is the government acting illegally, and can subscribers request the government to compensate for the losses?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] The above questions all belong to the administrative part and cannot be answered by laws and regulations.</p>
<h3>Unregistered School Graduation Certificates Invalid - Education Bureau Publicly Responds</h3>
<p>Editor: I am a graduate of the Jin Ke Model High School's senior high program. This semester, we are borrowing a school site from another school (because the original school building was taken back by Min Guang Middle School). Therefore, we are not yet registered, and we were not allowed to participate in the Education Bureau's qualification examination the other day. As a result, there are issues with our academic records. I have a few questions and would appreciate it if you could answer them for me. (1) Can the school be registered first, since the school site issue cannot be resolved? (2) For the sake of students' further education, can the diplomas be stamped first? (The registration is still in application, probably like Dajiang Middle School, which has had this precedent.) (3) If the school is closed down next semester, how will the academic records of this year's graduates be resolved? Please forward this to Xu Zhu Ping.</p>
<p>This column has received many letters with similar inquiries, so we immediately forwarded them to the Education Bureau for a response. Yesterday, we received the following reply: To whom it may concern: In response to reader Xu Zhuping's three questions in letter No. 160 of the Zongdu [General Reading] series dated August 3rd, which requested a response, we reply as follows: (1) Registration cannot be approved if there is no fixed school site. (2) Graduation certificates from unregistered schools will not be stamped. (3) Graduates of closed schools may apply for a qualification examination when one is held in the future. Please forward this reply accordingly. Sincerely, Li Ximou, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau.</p>

<h3>President Roosevelt's Compromise with the Soviet Union Has Already Caused Serious Consequences - The Soviet Union Expands Its Influence Towards the Near East and the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zuo Xi from The Saturday Evening Post</p>
<p>This spring's Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris, some say, was a specialized meeting, its primary purpose being to complete the peace treaties with the five German satellite states of Europe. But those attending the conference were well aware that it was not just a specialized meeting, but a testing ground to see if President Roosevelt's "Grand Design" had failed completely or succeeded partially, just as Paris became a testing ground for President Wilson's world reform plan twenty-seven years ago.</p>
<p>As early as 1943, Roosevelt determined that the Soviet Union held the key to world peace, and therefore personally drafted a "Grand Design" to establish friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the Western powers, preparing to wager the future of the United States on it. To gain the trust of the Soviet authorities, Roosevelt did not hesitate to depart from the spirit of the Atlantic Charter, and concluded secret agreements with the Soviet Union, giving away the rich regions of Europe and Asia to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Due to the need to maintain military secrets during the war, we have no way of knowing exactly what concessions the United States made to the Soviet Union. The US government has not yet published a detailed report on US-Soviet relations since 1941, but we have already obtained sufficient and reliable information. This is a report personally signed by Roosevelt, entitled "The True Story of the Tehran Conference." In this report, Roosevelt explained that when he attended the Tehran Conference in November 1943, he carried a plan for the post-war world, the biggest key to which was how to obtain sincere cooperation from the Soviet Union in order to solve post-war problems. In order to earn Stalin's trust, Roosevelt was prepared to make any necessary concessions. At that time, Stalin expressed his willingness to cooperate sincerely with the Soviet Union's friendly countries, and stated that he had no desire to encompass Europe. Roosevelt then deeply believed in Stalin's goodwill.</p>
<p>However, Churchill, representing one of the three powers at the Tehran Conference, did not agree with Roosevelt's views, and believed that it was possible to obtain Soviet understanding based on broad principles. Therefore, a serious conflict occurred between Britain and the Soviet Union, and Roosevelt mediated between them, attempting to eliminate differences of opinion in order to implement his plan to draw the Soviet Union into the international group.</p>
<p>But after the Tehran Conference closed, the Soviet Union repeatedly acted alone, without prior consultation with the allied powers. At this time, Roosevelt did not give up his efforts to coordinate with the Soviet Union. But in the months from the end of the Yalta Conference to Roosevelt's death, US-Soviet relations entered an extremely dark phase. At this time, Roosevelt began to doubt the sincerity of the Soviet Union. Just as he was preparing to reconsider his policy towards the Soviet Union, he suddenly died. When Truman succeeded Roosevelt as President of the United States, the war against Germany and Japan was still in progress; he also accepted Roosevelt's policy of friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union. Truman was in a position at the time where he could not easily change this policy.</p>
<p>During the period from Truman's inauguration as President of the United States in April 1945 to the United Nations conference held in Potsdam in August of the same year, the Soviet Union's attitude gradually became stubborn, its troop movements were often carried out unilaterally, and it even failed to notify the United Nations when concluding agreements with the liberated countries. At the Potsdam Conference, President Truman, in order to avoid changing his predecessor's policy towards the Soviet Union, gave even greater concessions to the Soviet Union. At this conference, the Western powers, disregarding the land provisions in the Atlantic Charter, approved the division of eastern Germany; it was also at this conference that the British and American governments, disregarding the traditional claims of American minority rights, supported the Soviet Union's immigration policy. Roosevelt had already made concessions in principle before, and President Truman had no choice but to recognize them afterwards. Although the results of the Potsdam Conference were kept secret, President Truman, after returning from this conference, had more doubts about the Soviet Union's intentions than before. From then on, Truman decided not to personally attend such three-power conferences again, and entrusted the handling of US-Soviet relations to experts in foreign policy.</p>
<p>Before Roosevelt's death, Stalin's national ambition plan became clearer. The Soviet Union clearly expressed its intention to divide the parts of Europe and Asia bordering the Soviet Union, and then reorganize them in a new form, in order to ensure the Soviet Union's economic and political advantages in these areas. The Soviet Union also, based on this plan, made Britain and the United States agree to the Soviet Union's annexation of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and parts of Finland, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Germany. In Asia, Stalin asked us to agree to the Soviet Union's annexation of the Kuril Islands, the recovery of the southern half of Sakhalin Island, and the restoration of the Soviet Union's special interests in the Northeast. In addition, the benefits gained by the Soviet Union in the Balkans, in Germany, and in Korea are too numerous to mention. If the Soviet Union was satisfied with obtaining so many benefits, then the Western countries would remain silent about their vested rights. But the Soviet Union was not satisfied, and began to expand its influence towards the Mediterranean and the Near East. The Soviet Union demanded the establishment of a fortress on Turkish territory to control the Dardanelles Strait. Afterwards, the Soviet Union forced the Iranian government to make major concessions to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>These political offensives by the Soviet Union are the biggest threat to the British Empire. Britain feels its strength is weak and has to hope for American support. At this time, President Truman felt that he could express his doubts about the so-called goodwill and cooperation of the Soviet Union. Indeed, there were too many reasons to doubt the Soviet Union, and at the same time, the Soviet Union's contribution to the so-called spirit of friendly cooperation was too little. Truman had recognized all of Roosevelt's concessions in Potsdam, and had even added a few concessions of his own. But seven months later, he made it clear that he finally denied the basic belief that prompted Roosevelt to make concessions to the Soviet Union—that is, the so-called "goodwill" of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>In addition to making concessions to the Soviet Union, Roosevelt also created a United Nations mechanism, but he felt that this mechanism would not take effect until after a few years. During this transition period, the US government had to implement power politics, even though most Americans would be dissatisfied with this approach. But only if the United States develops its own strong and independent policy, without favoring Britain or the Soviet Union, will the world have a chance to maintain balance. All these conditions formed our era, and the Paris Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference was a complete manifestation of this kind of power politics from beginning to end.</p>
<p>The reason why Roosevelt made such great concessions to the Soviet Union in the two years before his death was because at that time he felt that the Soviet Union needed peace and was willing to cooperate with the Western countries as the price of obtaining peace. But before Roosevelt's death, he gradually felt that the Soviet Union had no sincerity or generosity in paying the price, unless the bill collector urged him tightly. The Paris Foreign Ministers Conference was a step in the collection process—President Truman inherited this unpleasant task. He not only called on the American people to pay their own bills, but also encouraged the wartime allies to pay their bills. The United States is doing its best to eliminate the deepening hostility between the two Soviet factions and try to reconcile their differences. Similarly, the United States should let the Soviet Union know that unless the Soviet Union insists on forcibly promoting communism to various countries, the United States will never be willing to forcibly promote its capitalism to places that do not need it. What the Soviet Union is willing to pay for is not their vested rights, but what they currently need. Fortunately, what the Soviet Union currently needs most is peace, and the current US policy towards the Soviet Union is based on this belief: believing that the Soviet Union, in order to obtain peace, will not hesitate to pay any price, but in fact, the Soviet Union's performance in this regard is very reluctant, and the price they pay is so piecemeal.</p>

<h3>The United States: From Isolationism to International Cooperation</h3>
<p>The importance of the United States' position in international politics is a fact recognized by the world. The writer Comager wrote an article on the process of the United States' transition from isolationism to world cooperation, published in "America" Volume II, No. 8. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>American isolationism has failed, most of the time. A number of Americans, after seeing the bankruptcy of isolationism, have turned to internationalism. As Churchill said, in 1917 and 1944, the New World twice came out to save and liberate the Old World. The people and government of the United States are now prepared to take on appropriate responsibilities in organizing and maintaining the new world order.</p>
<p>However, how will internationalism prevail? What force overcame the United States' geographical and historical arguments for isolationism? This is by no means accidental, but involves economic, political, and moral aspects.</p>
<p>In a sense, although Americans previously considered themselves isolated, they were never actually isolated. Since the founding of the United States, it has always had close relations with world politics, but American politicians and the American people went through a long period of time before recognizing this point.</p>
<p>If we want to pinpoint the date when the United States began to participate in world politics as a major power, we should say it was the 1890s. At that time, the political situation in Europe changed drastically, and the United States changed even more so: due to the active development work, the border had directly approached the Pacific coast, the population had surged to 75 million, and the rapid progress of the industrial revolution had forced American manufacturers to seek markets around the world and promote the sales of products. In addition, the increasing convenience of transportation also made the relationship between the United States and other parts of the world closer. For fifty years, the United States has been developing outwards along this path, and ideas such as the "Monroe Doctrine" are of course absolutely inapplicable.</p>
<p>More important than these economic and social reasons are political and moral reasons. The industrial revolution and scientific inventions have shrunk the earth, and the natural defenses of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans have lost their inherent meaning. For the sake of national security, it is very obvious that it is necessary to actively participate in world politics. The United States must obtain understanding and cooperation from friendly countries to maintain world peace. The United States is part of the Atlantic society and part of the Pacific society. From a moral point of view, the world is a whole, and we cannot separate ourselves from the world. Democracy can only prosper in the United States under conditions where the world order is conducive to democracy. Finally, Americans have realized that the United States must be part of the world society, not only for economic or political reasons, but also for the most basic moral reasons. The concept of "all corners of the world are one family" has overcome the psychology of "going my own way."</p>
<h3>Blindness Restored - American "Eye Bank" Has Dead People's Corneas</h3>
<p>From the age of twelve until last October, Mr. Kleido had been blind for seventeen years. His eye disease seemed to be incurable. But six months ago, he had a novel operation on his left eye and was able to see the light of day again. He said that this operation was "the greatest miracle that a human body can encounter."</p>
<p>These few short sentences summarize the goals and achievements of the "Eye Bank." In mid-April, the Eye Bank had been established for a year. The work of the bank has been very successful, and this week it will establish a branch in Chicago. Plans to establish another branch in Boston in the near future have also been finalized.</p>
<p>Because of the Eye Bank, hundreds of blind people last year encountered the impossible, but there are still tens of thousands of other blind people waiting for help. According to estimates, among the 250,000 blind people in the United States, 100,000 could regain their sight after corneal transplant surgery. The biggest problem is the lack of corneas.</p>
<p>What is the cornea? If you look at yourself in the mirror, you can see the white area in your eyes, which is the sclera. At the same time, you will see the black pupil in the center of the sclera. The cornea is the transparent round window above the pupil and the sclera. In normal eyes, the cornea is often washed by tears and eyelids. However, sometimes this round window of the cornea is broken, soiled, or covered; only faint light can pass through it, and although the other parts of the eye are still normal, the person becomes blind.</p>
<p>For centuries, doctors have wanted to cut out the damaged cornea and replace it with a clear piece, but all of these efforts have been in vain and have not succeeded. They wanted to use glass, but people's eyes could not tolerate foreign objects. They had tried to transplant the corneas of various animals, from pigs to chickens, but the results were still unsuccessful. Finally, they used human corneas, and after several failures, they finally completed the work of transplanting human corneas.</p>
<p>This surgery is successful, but where do so many human corneas come from? Doctors can get it from several sources: certain patients often have eyes that cannot be preserved, but the eyes are flawless. However, this source is not enough to meet the urgent needs of thousands of blind people. Therefore, doctors have also been experimenting with dead people's eyes, and have found that the corneas on the bodies of people who have died for several hours are still alive and can be used to restore the sight of blind people.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Eye Bank is to collect donated eyes. The Eye Bank asks the dead of any race and age to donate their eyes. These eyes are sent to the Eye Bank, inspected, and then transferred to doctors who are skilled in corneal transplantation. In order to keep the eyes fresh for 22 hours, the major airlines in the United States are willing to transport these eyes, and the Eye Bank has become a national organization. More than eighty hospitals maintain contact with the Eye Bank, and naturally it has become a center for researching corneal surgery and training ophthalmologists in the United States.</p>
<p>What is it like to regain sight after blindness? Very few people in history have had this experience; after the discovery of corneal transplantation surgery, perhaps more people have experienced this in recent years than in the entire history of mankind.</p>
<p>Kleido has this experience. He is twenty-nine years old and a farmer in Pennsylvania. I mentioned him at the beginning of this article. He was a healthy child at the age of twelve. One day, his left eye was injured by a snowball thrown by a friend. In this way, the left eye began to become inflamed, as with a normal eye disease, and the right eye was also infected. No matter how carefully it was treated, the inflammation continued for six months without getting better. Later, the pain finally disappeared, but blindness had become a reality. The corneas of both eyes were scorched, so that light could not pass through and he was blind.</p>
<p>He never thought that he would see the light of day again. Shortly after becoming blind, he heard people talk about corneal transplantation, but the transplantation surgery at that time was unsuccessful, and he forgot about it. It was not until last year that he read (he was not completely blind) a magazine article on the Eye Bank. Later, he asked a pharmacist who was going to New York to inquire about the Eye Bank for him. Soon after, he went to New York in person to receive an examination and register for surgery. The people at the Eye Bank told him to be prepared at any time in order to have surgery when a suitable cornea was obtained.</p>
<p>Kleido said, "When they called me, I was stacking straw. Norna—my wife, we were not married at the time, although she was very willing, but I always insisted that I would not marry her while I was blind—Norna came and told me that the Eye Bank had called and asked him to take the next train to New York. That was last October. At that time, I was extremely excited and could hardly speak.</p>
<p>'When they removed my old cornea, my eyes lit up. When they put on the new cornea, I saw the lights above my head and the doctor's hand. The first time they removed the bandages, I saw the doctor's face. A week later, my vision was completely restored.'</p>
<h3>Mr. Nice Guy Truman's Style Differs from Roosevelt's; Adopting a New Stance</h3>
<p>— Translated and Described by Junmo, Originally Published in Harper's Magazine (US)</p>
<p>President Truman, like all Missourians, is a good-natured fellow, unless pushed too far. And now, Congress is pushing him a bit too far. Recent signs indicate that he has no choice but to fight Congress.</p>
<p>In administration, Truman's style is very different from his predecessor. Roosevelt's nature was one of lofty ideals and policies; he was uninterested in routine matters, and many uninteresting files would pile up on his desk and mold away after months. Truman, however, is quick, decisive, and he also empowers the heads of various departments with greater authority, so that many small matters no longer need to crowd onto the White House's desk.</p>
<p>It is very clear that Truman himself is primarily a man of affairs. He adopts Roosevelt's old methods because he knows they are useful. Because of this, Roosevelt was unprecedentedly elected president four times. Truman is no fool and would naturally not discard this good legacy. He inherited the old methods but was afraid to offend Congress. His subordinates are also those who hope to get along with everyone, radicals, conservatives, all are friendly. The practical political leader of the Democratic Party, Postmaster General Hannegan, and the policy planner for domestic politics, Director of the Retraining Bureau, Snyder, are all of this type. They are cautious, serious, careful, and rigid. Roosevelt's "brain trust" of ambitious strategists has scattered. They initially followed Roosevelt because of Roosevelt's innate dream of paradise, while Truman seems to only be dealing with current administrative matters, at most for the sake of the next election. The danger of this deficiency will probably only be truly seen when a major economic crisis arrives.</p>
<p>In ideals, Truman is inferior to Roosevelt, but in boldness of action, Truman has surpassed Roosevelt. The organization of his State Department is more orderly than ever before. He reorganized the Department of Agriculture, boldly merging fourteen sprawling agencies into a single Bureau of Production and Trade. But a good administrator alone cannot become a successful president, and Truman himself knows this. When he first entered the White House, he made two resolutions: first, to get along with Congress and not be constantly at odds with Congress like his predecessor; second, to have a "strong" cabinet to share some of the administrative responsibilities, so as not to be accused of "one-man dictatorship" again. His method was to kill two birds with one stone, that is, to appoint former members of Congress as his cabinet members. Unfortunately, this method was not successful at all. First, the relationship with Congress is not just a matter of ______. Even if ______ a meeting ______, they will not buy it. Sometimes, familiarity is a hindrance. Second, no one in Congress sincerely admires Truman. America is a society that worships heroes. Roosevelt was able to intimidate them, but Truman completely failed in this regard. As things have reached this point, Truman must either continue to yield or find a way to overwhelm Congress. Recent signs indicate that he is taking the latter path. This can be seen in three things: first, in his budget speech to Congress, he proposed extending price controls and raw material controls for eighteen months, which is clearly contrary to Congress's wishes; second, he directly appealed to the people through radio broadcasts; and third, he personally came out to mediate the recent labor strikes. All of these show that Truman is adopting a new stance.</p>
<p>What a great politician needs is vision, ability, and courageous judgment. Roosevelt seemed to have them, and Truman may prove that he has them too, although it is not yet fully apparent.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<p>Short Stories</p>
<h3>A Moment of Sunny Weather</h3>
<p>— Huang Jingya</p>
<p>A week of continuous rain finally stopped. As the dark clouds gradually disappeared behind the mountains on the horizon, the azure sky began to be covered with bright sunlight, and everything seemed worthy of praise. The distant mountains, the clear lake water, the rain-soaked parasol trees, didn't they all contain rich beauty and overflow with life and vitality?</p>
<p>Director Hu's mood was also as bright and clear as this moment of sunshine. The knot of worry tightly locked between his brows unconsciously loosened, and a few traces of a smile unfolded on the old wrinkles of his face. He also happily thought, what a wonderful sunny day it is!</p>
<p>After lunch, he strolled to the balcony outside the house and relaxed on the bamboo lounge chair. A ray of sunlight passed through his old face and penetrated straight into his old heart. He was immersed in this soft and gentle atmosphere, and the joy and hope soothed him, making him seem younger.</p>
<p>He carefully took out a piece of paper from his pocket and examined it repeatedly, the smile on his face becoming even stronger. This was a notice from a national bank approving an industrial loan. He spread it out on the small tea table in front of him, then calmly lit two cigarettes, watching the wisps of light smoke gently swirl and rise in the warm sunlight, gradually lifting a trace of hope from the depths of his soul, allowing this hope to form a colorful and beautiful net.</p>
<p>Indeed, this was something to be happy about:</p>
<p>He was an industrialist, and his job was naturally to run a factory. After graduating from school, he put his entire inheritance from his father into this goal, and with more than twenty years of time, perseverance, and hard work, he finally stood up today in the vast industrial field.</p>
<p>Over a series of not-so-short years, he painstakingly overcame many difficulties. He experienced the impact of the global economic depression, constantly managed to lightly compete with imported goods for sales, and during the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he even more arduously moved again and again. In the backward rear areas, cut off from the outside world, he still managed to maintain production, which everyone considered a miracle, but he casually dealt with it.</p>
<p>The sounds of victory moved him to tears, and immediately he found a way to move the factory back to his homeland. At that time, he laughed loudly with joy and proudly boasted that in the past he had been threatened by the cannons and planes of the great powers, but now? His own country was also one of the five great powers, and it was time to turn things around!</p>
<p>However, in the three months after returning, unexpected difficulties piled up in front of him, forcing him to knit his brows and sigh deeply, which surprised his wife. Prices soared like lightning, raw material prices increased, wages were frequently adjusted, and the sluggishness of sales seemed to come all at once. He put down some activity shell, but it was like a small stone thrown into a pond, without any response. "When the bed is full of gold, the brave man has no face," so he was as anxious as an ant on a hot pot, and many lines of life were carved on his old face.</p>
<p>Friends advised him to stop work and sell the factory, or stop work and temporarily avoid the limelight, but he couldn't bear to give it up, because it was the crystallization of his life! In the most difficult times, some speculative business friends came to persuade him:</p>
<p>"Mr. Hu, let's call it quits! I think you should stop work immediately, then sell the factory, or sell the raw materials, and put together more than a hundred thousand yuan to partner with me in the gold, dollar, and cotton yarn business. I guarantee you will make twice your capital in less than three months, and live a peaceful life. Why worry all day long? Your hair has turned quite a bit white these days, alas! Why bother so much?" A pair of round, rolling eyes were turning.</p>
<p>"To tell you the truth, running a factory can't beat foreigners. They have a hundred years of foundation, and the things they make are better than ours in every way, and the price is cheaper. Who will buy expensive domestic goods that are also troublesome? To be honest with you, even the toilet paper in my house is American, hee hee! The world is different now, hee hee... Make up your mind, I guarantee you will make twice your capital in less than three months..."</p>
<p>Under the almost ______ line of the friend's smiling ______, he lowered his head and hesitated. "No sales," "twice the capital," repeatedly hit his will, blurred, confused, shaken, he muttered to himself, "twenty years of hard work... twenty years of hard work..."</p>
<p>"No! × Weng, I've decided, no matter what, I will support the factory, this is my twenty years of hard work, I can't just give it up. Although running industry is full of difficulties now, the government will definitely find a way to solve it, I will never do speculative business, this kind of thing is not what I do..." He firmly refused. The factory was the crystallization of his life, and if he abandoned it, what would he live for in the future? He must support it.</p>
<p>"The poor sales now are also a temporary phenomenon that will improve in the future. Later, the Chinese people will definitely know what they should buy..." He became happy and said more vividly:</p>
<p>"Don't you remember? Before the War of Resistance, Japanese goods were dumped. No matter how fierce the Japanese were, everyone still rose up to oppose them. The students even went to smash the shops that sold Japanese goods, didn't they? Moreover, the United States is a peace-loving country that supports justice, and it will never destroy us, it will only support us... I dare to believe that there is hope for Chinese industry." He completely forgot his worries and difficulties.</p>
<p>Today, he suddenly received this approved loan</p>
<p>Just as he was about to stand up and comically make gestures, a burst of children's noise, like a sharp pair of scissors, cut up his beautiful net. He stood up, wanting to scold his children playing on the lawn, when a newspaper that had just been delivered covered the notice, and one large headline after another caught his eye.</p>
<p>"Total Imports in May Exceed 50 Billion, Total Exports Only Exceed 10 Billion," "More Than 100 Factories in Chongqing Closed Down," "President Song Announces Opening of Inland Water Navigation Rights for One Year," "Large Quantities of American Supplies Continuously Shipped to China." He took a cold breath and continued to read;</p>
<p>"Most of Shanghai Milk Companies Closed Down Due to Market Saturation with Klim Milk Powder and Inability to Compete. It is Said that the Executive Yuan Has Ordered 10,000 Dairy Cows from the United States, Which Are Already on Their Way to China," "Lu Zuofu Goes to Beijing to Negotiate for Commercial Relief and Subsidies; Minsheng Company Loses More Than 3 Billion Yuan," "×× Railway Damaged Again; Although Coal Mines Have Abundant Coal Reserves, It Cannot Be Transported," "Shanghai Gas Company Considering Using Indian Coal."</p>
<p>As if he had malaria, he fell into an ice cellar of severe cold, powerless to fall onto the chair, causing the rattan to creak. The children's noise clearly entered his ears.</p>
<p>"Don't cry, Xiao Bao! Tomorrow, Mom will buy you a foreign doll."</p>
<p>"Mom! I want an American one, the Chinese ones are not good."</p>
<p>"Mom! I want to buy an American glass belt, other classmates have them..."</p>
<p>"Mom! The newspaper says a batch of American woolens has already arrived, I want to make a suit tomorrow, oh! There is also a batch of jeeps for sale, Mom, ask Dad to buy one!" "Mom! Mom! Yesterday I saw the older sister next door, Guan, wearing an American linen cheongsam, I want to make one too. Didn't you say you wanted to buy Max Factor cosmetics? Let's go to Wing On Company together tomorrow..."</p>
<p>"Oh! Er Shi, where did you come from, running all sweaty."</p>
<p>"Mom! I just came back from the Bund, Mom, look, I bought a can of coffee and a tin of ice cream powder, all Made in U.S.A. This tube of tea is also American! Guess how much it costs..."</p>
<p>He blankly picked up the covered notice. That row of numbers vaguely became smaller, as if only a blank piece of paper was left, while the headlines on the newspaper became even larger, so large that they filled his entire eye socket. It seemed that a cunning, fat face appeared again, "Humph! See you try to compete with foreigners, a small stone trying to block the surging waves..." "Who will buy awkward and expensive domestic goods, good! I'll see you succeed." "Too bad you're not the Premier of the Executive Yuan!"</p>
<p>The weather was very cool, perfect for wearing a jacket, but he felt extremely hot, as if lying naked in the scorching sun, tormented and uncomfortable.</p>
<h3>Speaking</h3>
<p>— Zhongyuan</p>
<p>I am the least eloquent person, but I love to listen to people talking.</p>
<p>Once I heard two young ladies talking. One said, "Look, I'm really taken in. When I came out, the rain was obviously very heavy, so I had to drag myself along wearing a raincoat. Who knew the sun would be so good now? How annoying!" The other chuckled and said, "Did your cousin give you this beautiful raincoat again?" The first twisted and turned, her voice with pride, "Who wants him to give it to me? What bad luck!" The other smiled ambiguously and said, "But many women are not afraid of bad luck, just to avoid being so cheap!" The first's face turned a little: "It's a pity that some women are so cheap that no one wants them!" The other was not polite either: "Yes! That's why I often say, it's a pity to use a beauty like you to hook up with our cousin! If you were put in a dance hall in Shanghai, business would really be booming!" Hearing this, the first one was furious: "What are you saying? Do you want a slap?" The other jumped up: "A slap, a slap, do you want to eat a slap from a cheap slut like you?"... You said one sentence, I said one sentence, and in the end, it became more and more nonsensical, and I didn't dare to listen anymore.</p>
<p>Later, I inquired and found out that the two ladies were rivals in love, no wonder they started arguing before they said three sentences.</p>
<p>However, even if they are not rivals in love, even if they are the best of friends, the most loving husband and wife, the most decent and dignified officials, talking often starts well but ends in quarrels.</p>
<p>Conflicts are inevitable in conversation.</p>
<p>Many people think that speaking is a skill. I think speaking is like sowing seeds: if you sow thorns and poisonous awns, you will reap thorns and poisonous awns; if you sow flowers and fragrant grass, you will reap flowers and fragrant grass.</p>
<h3>Youth</h3>
<p>— Shidi</p>
<p>Do you boast about your precious youth? You are wrong, you should recognize what kind of land this is. In some lands, youth is a glorious crown; in some lands, it is diamonds and jewels that can be bought with money to be inlaid in the rings and necklaces of gentlemen and ladies; but in some lands, it is just the dew on the tip of the grass.</p>
<p>The dew on the tip of the grass should also have its bright moment in the morning, but in some lands, before a trace of morning breeze caresses it or a ray of morning light shines on it, it is already trampled into the mud by fierce riding hooves.</p>
<p>As for yourself, I advise you to recognize, in what kind of territory are you ultimately located? What has your youth ultimately achieved in your land?</p>
<p>Cry for the silent departed who have fallen into the mud! Put on a crown of thorns, and when the dew on the crown dries, you can adorn it with pearls of tears scattered at your feet.</p>
<p>There is no crown, but you are still radiant, and your crystal clarity is even better than diamonds and pearls.</p>
<p>Your youth will no longer be lonely. Yes, therefore, you are still worth boasting about. The notice, you think, how could he not be as happy as seeing a clear sky after a long rain?</p>
<p>He seemed to have become a lark, soaring proudly in the hopeful clouds.</p>
<p>The loan came, and he survived this difficult period. In the future, the production rate in the factory increased, the goods were greatly improved, and they were widely trusted by the Chinese people. The overflowing interest turned into new factories, behind the green plain, countless chimneys stood, the sound of the machine in the morning woke up the sleeping birds in the forest, and the whistle of work at the end of the evening dispersed the bats intertwined on the roof, and the workers' cars sped home on the road.</p>
<p>The national industry was thriving, and their goods were also carried by magnificent fleets to distant markets abroad, where people praised, "This is a Chinese product!"</p>
<p>He also had some desire for enjoyment, and the old lines may disappear in a comfortable life. He would accompany his fashionably dressed wife to spend the summer in Switzerland, leisurely watching the unsullied snow of the Alps side by side, and spend the winter in the South Sea Islands. When others were shivering from the cold, they were happily bathing in the green sea waves, picking up fruits thrown down by monkeys from the coconut palms to quench their thirst. Occasionally they would go to skyscrapers to cool off, wander in front of Buckingham Palace, stroll on the avenues covered with plane trees in Paris, and give industrial speeches at welcome parties in Ottawa or Buenos Aires...</p>
<h3>Wells on Novels</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Wells's novels include romances, character novels, revolutionary novels, and short stories of fantasy and satire. How should we categorize him after seriously studying his works and influence? The utopian romances woven into "The Wheels of Chance" (1895), the humor of "Kipps" (1905) and "The Sea Lady" (1902) belong to his early literary revelations. In recent years, he has lost much of his playful humor and utopian visions; he is more saddened by social and political conflicts, so much so that his recent representative long novels emit endless tones of resistance. He attempts to escape to a larger realm of the soul, challenging the world as a reformer and philosopher. Such tones are abundant in the pages of "Tono-Bungay" (1909), "Ann Veronica" (1909), and "The New Machiavelli" (1910). This tendency became more pronounced after the publication of "Mr. Britling Sees It Through" (1916) and "The World of William Clissold" (1926). During the First European War, his multifaceted works had a large readership and many commentators. His novels and "The Outline of History" (1920) almost became prophecies. Some critics do not call him a novelist, but a propagandist; others call him a pretentious person, saying that his irony is tiresome, but nevertheless has a great influence. He often changes his position; without warning, he immediately goes in the opposite direction, but to sympathetic readers, his radical contradictions seem quite sincere. His personality is complex and magnetic. His thinking is not traditional, but detached from traditional standards. J.D. Beresford said: "In fact, Wells is normal; his early fantasies were not thwarted by the teachings of his parents, teachers, and classmates."</p>
<p>Wells was born in Bromley, England. His father was a professional cricketer, but he failed in running a shop. His mother was the daughter of a Sussex innkeeper, who worked as a maid before marriage, and later returned to work as a head maid at Upper Park near Petersfield. Memories of this environment are vividly described in the first few chapters of Tono-Bungay. He received limited education, and at the age of thirteen, he worked as a shop assistant in a pharmacy. Before the age of sixteen, he also worked as an apprentice in a cloth shop, first in Windsor, then in Southsea. He was admitted to the Normal School of Science in South Kensington as a free student, just like the protagonist in "Love and Lewisham" (1900). He studied with Huxley and received an honorary medal in biology; his memories of Huxley are written in "Joan and Peter" (1918). At that time, he said he was "wandering around London," participating in large political gatherings, listening to Morris preach socialism, Gladstone lecture on family rules, and Bradlaugh speak on atheism.</p>
<p>He served as a headmaster in St. John's for a short period. He wrote a textbook on biology, which was considered successful. Encouraged by W.E. Henley, he wrote essays and criticisms for the Pall Mall Magazine, The Saturday Review, and other magazines. Soon, he wrote his first batch of fantastical novels, such as "The Time Machine" (1895) and "The War of the Worlds" (1898). From 1895 to 1905, prophetic novels were quite popular, such as Lytton's "The Coming Race" and E. Bellamy's "Looking Backward." Wells changed his views, which differed from his earlier mechanical stories, but his basic viewpoint remained the same—carrying the dignity of the aristocracy, with rebellion and dissent as slogans, requiring freedom, justice, and a "purified civilization." In "The War of the Worlds," he opposed the "warmongers" with individual courage.</p>
<p>After the fantastical legends, two more realistic novels are "Marriage" (1912) and "The New Machiavelli," both of which, along with Tono-Bungay, belong to autobiographical novels. The protagonist in Tono-Bungay is originally a submarine engineer who, due to poverty, has to engage in a profession he dislikes, just like the scientist in "Marriage" who is forced out of the laboratory to do business due to the need for money. "The New Machiavelli" writes about his childhood impressions of London, which were not developed with precise planning; "That era made me unbearable; the local people were all bound, and even with freedom and power, they could not play a cultural role." In his view, Bromley was just "dull, useless, deflated human activity, just a big pile of useless things." He more vehemently attacks society and its people, and his novels echo a tone of destruction, even more so than resistance—a person's passion or society's evil traditions destroy life. He believes that the "chaotic world" has become even more chaotic after the war. The extreme of this destruction is "The World of William Clissold," but it still harbors a vague hope for the future. This book reflects the author's reaction to external life and his internal efforts to strive for the unattainable.</p>
<p>Reading the newspaper, I was shocked to learn that the British novelist H.G. Wells passed away peacefully on August 13, 1946, at 4 p.m. He suffered from diabetes and his mental state was not good. I translated this section from Mabel's "Studies in English and American Novels" as a memorial. Liang Sicheng has translated Wells's "The Outline of History," published by the Commercial Press. There are also translated versions of "A Short History of the World," "The Science of Life," and "The Shape of Things to Come." As for novels, Wu Lifu once excerpted "Ann Veronica." I remember that the "War of the Worlds" and "The World Twenty Thousand Years Hence" published by the Civilization Bookstore are also works by Wells. Lin Qinnan seems to have translated "Mr. Britling Sees It Through," which is "Ming Xian Ren". I bought a collection of Wells's science short stories and gave it to Mr. Gu Junzheng, but he doesn't seem to have translated it. Wells's novels had a very limited impact on the Chinese New Literary scene.</p>

<p>Order—To the Special Military Unit Stationed in Ping: Our garrison is weak. We can feign an attack on Wanlu to test the occupation of Pingjin. Intensify negotiations, using both force and diplomacy, and await reinforcements. Our large armies stationed in Manchuria and Korea have already been dispatched. This order—July 12, 1 p.m.</p>
<p>Order—To the Special Military Unit Stationed in Ping: Our cabinet has decided yesterday to implement the resolution by force to solve the China issue in accordance with the planned schedule, as an initial action for the implementation of the Tanaka Plan. The potential of our troops stationed in various parts of China has been intensified and launched; quickly contact them to cooperate in the action. This order—July 12, 4 p.m."</p>
<p>Since July 11, Konoe, according to a certain established secret plot, passed the entire cabinet to launch the Greater East Asia War. In the past four days, we have received many reports from various liaison stations, all of which are closely related to the "Seven Secret Seals."</p>
<p>Especially on July 13, a message came from Tokyo 016, finding out that the original "Secret Seal" was indeed in Konoe's residence, and two abridged volumes are currently being produced, one to be given to the head of the army and one to the head of the navy; and another copy has been replicated for use as a reference during the Supreme Military Council.</p>
<p>What made Tsurumi most anxious was the report from the main station 06 obtained at 3:30 a.m. on July 15: "The head of the Orchid Group has just arrived in Shenyang from Tokyo, holding a military action plan based on the outline of the "Secret Seal." This of course indicates that the influence of Doihara has obviously surpassed the Plum and Pine Groups.</p>
<p>Since receiving this report, we have dispelled our sleepiness and carefully considered it. The point that Tsurumi feels most uneasy about is that he has already notified the Chinese intelligence about the news of the seven secret seals, explaining how the relationship of the secret seal affects the peace of the world, and is responsible for investigating and destroying the contents of this secret.</p>
<p>Now, not only has he not found out the content of the secret seal, but the power-grabbing blood-sucking demon Doihara has taken the lead and snatched the plan to launch a great war. Young people naturally love to win, let alone Tsurumi. He feels as if the head of the Chinese intelligence is right next to him, questioning him why he didn't take action quickly, so that the living beings of the whole world could not avoid suffering a cruel disaster? He felt ashamed.</p>
<p>I know Tsurumi's temper deeply. He absolutely does not welcome consoling explanations, let alone encouragement; the only way is to treat him like a lively and intelligent child, and quickly bring up another topic to divert his interest when he is frustrated:</p>
<p>"Why not go back to Shenyang, play a small joke with Doihara first, and then take a trip to Tokyo to try the means of stealing the sky and changing the day?" I know that going to Tokyo to obtain the secret seal is simply tantamount to taking one's life as a child's play. The Japanese secret agents are already enough to deal with, and the counter-espionage network of the Orchid, Plum, and Pine groups is arranged as meticulously as heaven and earth; in addition, there is the German fifth column, and those who participate in the defense are all masters. But I also know that even if I don't say this, he will always have to go back to the country to try his means.</p>

<h3>All-Out Nerve Warfare</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>The new adjustment of foreign exchange rates has been compared to an economic atomic bomb, causing chaos in the market all day on the 19th, a frenzy of hurricane. Shanghai people are already neurasthenic, so they become even more hysterical. The American writer Sinclair described in "The Money Changers"—"like squids in the sea, desperately chasing that ray of light"—is being performed before our eyes.</p>
<p>Rumors are not to be talked about (it is said that someone bought U.S. dollars for 60 million yuan on the 17th). I know that a friend mobilized 40 million yuan of funds on the 18th, and drove around all the big and small money houses in Shanghai in a car, but did not buy a single U.S. dollar. So, he retreated to the second best option, he bought 20 million yuan of American cigarettes.</p>
<p>This kind of story happened in Shanghai in the past two days, and there are countless of them. As for buying two cans of Cling-on milk powder, buying three bottles of cod liver oil pills… that is even more common.</p>
<p>Time is gold. In the past two days, I know how much joy and how many tears there were; but, gasoline went from 1,300 yuan a gallon back to its original price, gold fell to 230… everything is like a myth. You have no reason to explain the reason for this sharp rise and fall. If there is a reason, there is only one, speculation.</p>
<p>All-out nerve warfare. If you feel scared, then you are still you; otherwise, you will have a few more banknotes in your pocket.</p>
<p>A friend in the banking industry said: The most disadvantaged are our friends who don't have U.S. dollars, because with U.S. dollars and foreign exchange, he can use them to offset the rising prices, and there is no loss. Those who don't have them cannot get anything from the new adjustment, but instead increase their expenditures from the rising prices.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rate Change</h3>
<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>Occasional Thoughts on Current Affairs</p>
<p>Like a bolt from the blue, the foreign exchange rate has been adjusted.</p>
<p>People who have been tempered by war are particularly sensitive to the economy. Everyone predicts: the man-made chaos in the market, and the sudden rise in prices.</p>
<p>Despite the government's earnest advice, the adjustment of foreign exchange has been used by speculators after all, bringing a frenzy to the market. Many items in the stores have temporarily disappeared, or the prices have already changed. U.S. dollars, gold, and securities, of course, will not miss the opportunity.</p>
<p>The adjustment of foreign exchange is done with good intentions by the government, but in the end some people are laughing and some people are crying in secret, truly turning into a tragic and cruel picture. Some people are cutting others, and some people are being cut by others, but those who are left in a dilemma are mostly because they are too practical and too ruthless! In the past day, the speculators who caused a complete fiasco are countless!</p>
<p>However, those who ordered foreign goods, those who have U.S. gold bars in their hands, and those who hoarded a large number of goods should hold a grand celebration banquet. It can truly be said that without any effort, they confusedly added many "zeros" to their assets overnight. This group of people originally hoped that prices would skyrocket, so that their wealth could also increase by leaps and bounds. Sure enough, "Heaven does not disappoint those who work hard", "Hoarding goods for a thousand days, using them in one morning", just look at today's situation!</p>
<p>The most miserable are the civil servants. Their salaries have just increased a little, and the added money has not yet been received, but prices have risen relentlessly. The government should quickly come up with a way to cash out!</p>
<p>The foreign exchange has been adjusted, and many people are using other people's fresh blood as fine wine, warmly celebrating the great cause of getting rich. Some people are weeping in secret, worrying about their lives, and shedding tears for the future! The country's policies must take into account the overall situation, and it is inevitable that many people will suffer losses, but there should also be sanctions against these blood-sucking demon merchants who enjoy the fruits of their labor!</p>
<h3>Wells on Personality</h3>
<p>— Yu Fen, excerpted from Wells's Autobiography</p>
<p>The great British writer H.G. Wells, who wrote prolifically, unfortunately passed away on the 13th of this month at the age of seventy-nine, leaving more than a hundred works, which were widely circulated for a time, especially his two books "The Outline of History" and "The Shape of Things to Come," which are extensively quoted and insightful! He has a collection of "Wells's Autobiography" published, which contains detailed descriptions of his family background, life experience, and the social, political, and economic situation at that time. This article is Wells's discussion of personality. It is excerpted as follows to show one aspect of his thoughts and style.</p>
<p>What is called personality is a person's concept of what he privately is, what kind of person he hopes to be, and how he hopes others to view him. It therefore provides a standard, according to which he can judge what he is able to do, what he should do, and what he must do. Every individual has a personality; without personality, self-behavior and self-explanation are impossible.</p>
<p>Personality may be very fixed, or it may change very drastically. It may be absolutely faithful, or some or all of its elements may be drawn from the realm of fantasy. It can exist in the spirit of the same person in various postures. We can have a single personality, or we can have several personalities, and in the latter situation, our hearts are full of contradictions, causing ourselves and our friends to fall into confusion. Our personalities grow, change, and age like us. They are rarely the entirety of our conscious spiritual entity. All kinds of mixtures are incompletely connected to each other, or not connected at all, and may run away with us in a completely unexpected situation.</p>
<p>Personality may be fundamentally false, like the personalities of many hypocrites. It may be an institution of delusion used to fill emptiness, like many self-important people. But it cannot be concluded that a person who has carefully selected a personality based on his feelings and motives is also working to deceive himself. If a person can act according to a plan of how he thinks he should act, he may very faithfully restrain, ignore, and even cancel many of his inherent motives and tendencies. The mask of a pleasant hypocrite—personality—finally becomes his true face!</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange: Long Position</h3>
<p>On the phone</p>
<p>A: Hello! Hello; Is that Lao Zhang? I'm telling you an urgent message, the foreign exchange has gone long. I just got the news last night, the futures are sure to rise!</p>
<p>B: Really? Hello, hello, why didn't you tell me earlier! The last batch of orders hasn't been paid for yet! Oh no, oh no, I didn't buy the futures, and I recently sold U.S. dollars. Alas, alas! Hurry to the store to tell them not to open for trading, and listen to the wind first!</p>
<p>In the store</p>
<p>Manager: How is it, has the account been calculated? How much is the loss?</p>
<p>Accountant: Yesterday and today's market prices differ by more than 80 million!</p>
<p>Manager: That won't do! There are no funds! That! That, that, alas! Who knew that this unlucky American goods would ruin my trading company! Bankrupt, bankrupt!</p>
<p>In the hotel</p>
<p>Accountant: Sir, please calculate according to the price list plus 50%!</p>
<p>Guest: Why? Was it decided by the Trade Association?</p>
<p>Accountant: The U.S. dollar has risen. There is no time for a public discussion, so we are raising the price by 50% in advance!</p>
<h3>Seen at the North Station</h3>
<p>— Chi Mo</p>
<p>Although the runners are fewer, they have not disappeared completely. Groups of three or five still come and go. The Shanghai goods they bring are mostly towels, sugar, cigarettes, etc. Piles of goods are piled up like mountains. Among these runners, there are many young women. They have a very good relationship with the employees and the traffic police. They always talk and laugh, which is completely different from the past style of "black hats" who "recognize tickets but not people."</p>
<p>The sign at the ticket window clearly states that the ticket sales time is "1:40", but the ticket sales only started at "1:55". It is said that it is delayed by a quarter of an hour every time, for some unknown reason. Perhaps this is what the "New Life Movement" requires.</p>
<p>The weather is so hot, and the people queuing to buy tickets are still so crowded, sweating profusely, as if they were "shoe lasts" in the cobbler's burden, with their backs and chests squeezed so hard that it is difficult to breathe. Moreover, there are still more than two hours before the ticket sales time, which is really unbearable. Fortunately, the "scalpers" have returned, and "black market tickets are supplied as usual." Second-class tickets to Hangzhou are sold for only 6,000, which is a bit more expensive than the selling price, but it is not too expensive, and saves the squeeze. So, buy one from them. They are very popular, although they make a lot of money in a day, but "black money is used fairly." If they "chew in the window" and "swallow it alone," then there is a possibility of "falling" in.</p>
<p>The place at the third-class ticket office looks like a refugee group's exodus scene, standing, squatting, sitting on the ground, large and small packages, luggage, boxes of goods, a chaotic and complicated situation, which is really difficult to describe. There is a vivid close-up shot every second. Suddenly, in the crowd, a young traveler grabbed two "pickpocket kids" with both hands. These two children look like they are only eleven or twelve years old, but they are very "old-mouthed" "mosquitoes". They rely on their young age to not attract attention, and they easily fish in troubled waters, carrying bags, and probing pockets. It is said that there are more than a dozen of these "pickpocket kids" who specialize in stealing at the "North Station". Moreover, the clothes of this group of young pickpockets are very clean. I hope the traffic police will pay attention. It is best to send them to a children's home after the police station arrests them, where they need to be influenced for a long time.</p>

<h3>The Puppet Emperor Puyi: A Character Sketch</h3>
<p>— Qian Fanfu</p>
<p>The Xinhai Revolution drove him from his throne, and that "national essence," that "national treasure" queue, always trailed behind his head. Many old ministers and remnants of the old dynasty considered this queue a symbol of the restoration of the "Great Qing Empire." But when Henry wanted to marry, his fiancée demanded that he cut off this "pig tail" before she would marry him. This queue itched in hot weather, and he had long wanted to get rid of it, but he knew that if he spoke up, those few long-bearded "old ministers" would certainly object. He told her this, and she spat at him, saying, "Open your eyes and look clearly. Boys your age don't wear queues. It's so inconvenient!..."</p>
<p>On May 3rd of the tenth year of the Republic of China—in the "Xuantong 13th year" within the Summer Palace—he took his last photo with the queue hanging down, bathed and fasted, and reported to the ancestral temple... A court attendant dressed him in the most fashionable "American style" clothes, and he took another photo of himself as a young gentleman that he could barely recognize. Of course, he was wearing a suit from 1921.</p>
<p>The old ministers sighed repeatedly, and they simply closed their doors and ignored outside affairs. The "Great Qing" was thus completely cleansed.</p>
<p>Henry and his wife didn't care at all. They thought that it was most shameful for young people nowadays to not be able to hum foreign languages. They hired an English gentleman—Johnston—to teach them English. Of course, they hoped to have English names as well, because she found it amusing to hear male and female students call each other "George" and "Mary." So Mr. Johnston named them Henry and Elizabeth—the names of two British emperors and empresses, both of whom had unfortunately already entered their tombs. But they did not grasp the satirical meaning within.</p>
<p>Henry once wanted to be a poet, but the epigrams he composed were either prosodically incorrect or incomprehensible. He finally retreated in the face of difficulty.</p>
<p>After the "September 18th Incident," Henry, because his annual expenses were allocated by the Chinese government, did not want to offend his "patrons," so at first he loudly declared: "I will never be used by the enemy!" However, after discussing it with his wife, they realized that prices were soaring, and the Chinese government's annual allowance to them was still only four million. Not only was their life not as good as those rich people, but they didn't even dare to play mahjong for large stakes... The short man, Doihara, promised him that as long as... then food and supplies would be abundant. Life is only a hundred years, so it's better to enjoy the present.</p>
<p>So, he became a puppet emperor, thinking he could live a stable life. He never dreamed...</p>
<p>Now, he has become a "problematic figure" attracting global attention, all because of a single thought... In fact, he is just one of many ordinary people, because he has all the desires of a common man.</p>
<h3>A Smile</h3>
<p>— Tao Wei</p>
<p>Teacher: When I was your age, the teacher only needed to teach us a book once or twice, and I understood it. You're really not as smart as I was. I've already taught you seven or eight times, and you still don't understand at all.</p>
<p>Student: That's because your teacher was better than mine. My teacher is not as good as your teacher!</p>
<h3>High Interest Loans</h3>
<p>— Cheng Lian</p>
<p>Recently, the place where we work completed its semi-annual accounting. This is usually a very normal thing. However, the result was quite unexpected: the interest alone exceeded the operating expenses, including the salaries, allowances, meals, and other expenses of all employees.</p>
<p>We cannot deny this ironclad fact: the dumping of foreign goods and the exploitation of high-interest loans have brought industry and commerce to the end of the road, on the verge of bankruptcy. High-interest loans are even more pervasive, scraping the bone and sucking the marrow, extending into every crevice.</p>
<p>There are countless people in society who live off high-interest loans. Some lend directly, and others act as "brokers" seeking profit in between. Opening the classified ads in the newspaper, you can find phrases like "cash available for loan." Indeed, someone who has three or five million in cash can live a decent life just from the interest income.</p>
<p>The practice of high-interest lending is not only prevalent in cities but is also rapidly spreading to small towns and villages in the interior. The interest rates are even more frighteningly high, generally 30% per month, but some are 40% or 50%, and interest is settled every ten days or every week. Small merchants who borrow high-interest loans should never expect to turn around. The exploitation is layered, and interest rolls on interest, until those small shops close and liquidate.</p>
<p>As for the countryside, they don't even calculate in terms of interest anymore. When food supplies are short, farmers borrow one *zu* of rice and return two *zu* during the autumn harvest. There is also "selling green rice," where one *dan* of rice is only worth one-third of the market price. "Pre-selling" means receiving money in advance and delivering goods at harvest time. This is a very risky business. Not only can they not withstand the heavy interest exploitation, but they also have no guarantee of the autumn harvest. Yet they have to do it for the sake of survival.</p>
<p>We have also seen that the government has low-interest loans, but they seem to have changed in nature. How much actually reaches factories, shops, and farmers?</p>
<p>Borrowing high-interest loans is like drinking poison to quench thirst, but they are not fools. It's just that they can only do this when they have no other choice, caring for the present but not for the future.</p>
<p>Under the heavy pressure of high-interest loans, all industry, commerce, and agriculture are left with only a thread of final breath. Yet the practice of high-interest lending is flourishing. If things continue like this, perhaps even that thread of breath will soon be gone.</p>
<h3>Education Circle</h3>
<p>— Wen Yi</p>
<p>On the first day of the Jida University entrance exam, the first subject was Chinese, with the essay topic being "A Discourse on Using Severe Punishment in a Chaotic State," with ten annotations: "One *luan*, two *mao*, three *tong*, four tones, five dynasties, six scripts, seven compendiums, eight-legged essay, nine schools, ten wings." After the first subject was completed, in the second subject, English, one-tenth of the examinees were absent. The English essay topic was: College Student and Politics. By the afternoon, during the Civics exam, the number of those giving up the exam had reached slightly more than two-tenths. By the second day of the exam, the number of those who were absent had reached three or four-tenths.</p>
<p>A certain Hu Nan middle school in this city originally had about 500 students. This time, the number of applicants exceeded twice the original number of students at the school. Recommendation letters piled up on the desk. The school principal once said to the admissions office staff: "There is no limit to the number of applicants. Fortunately, the students who will be admitted have already been decided internally."</p>
<p>A Living Drama</p>
<h3>The Principal and His Wife</h3>
<p>— Jin Lu</p>
<p>Time: Evening of August ××, 1946 People: Principal, Principal's Wife</p>
<p>Scene: Upstairs in a lane primary school, a normal bedroom</p>
<p>The curtain rises with the wife sitting on the sofa listening to the radio. The principal enters.</p>
<p>Principal: Hey! My Queen Majesty.</p>
<p>Wife: Don't use that tone. I'm asking you: did the advertisement go up?</p>
<p>Principal: It did. This is my life, just like you...</p>
<p>Wife: (Interrupting) How is it written? Read it to me.</p>
<p>Principal: (Reciting) "A certain primary school intends to hire several female teachers who are able to endure hardship and are willing to provide partial voluntary service. Those interested please come to ×× Road, No. ×."</p>
<p>Wife: Hmm! I'll give you 60 points for the phrase "partial voluntary service."</p>
<p>Principal: (On a new topic) The semester is scheduled to start on September 1st. That's really good.</p>
<p>Wife: What's good about it? It just saves the salary for August. If it were in October, November... all the way to the holidays, that would be good, wouldn't it?</p>
<p>Principal: (Changing the subject) I'm afraid the students won't have enough seats, right?</p>
<p>Wife: More than 500 kids, divided into six classrooms. It's not really that crowded! (Suddenly remembering, complaining) I told you to collect 100,000 from each of them, but you only dared to collect 80,000, afraid they'd run away? What a *fool*! Others want to collect 120,000, and that's not even considered expensive.</p>
<p>Principal: How can I not want to collect more? It's just that I was confused for a moment and too kind! That's right! They still have to study, so where would they run to? (Hits his own head)</p>
<p>Wife: You old fool, you *idiot*, I've lost 10 million yuan for nothing. Dozens of silk stockings have been thrown into the Huangpu River for you. The rolling interest alone is not small, you know?</p>
<p>Principal: ...</p>
<p>Wife: (Acting spoiled) Are you going to compensate me?</p>
<p>Principal: I'll compensate, I'll compensate. (Viciously) In the middle of the semester, I'll find a way to earn back both the principal and interest for you. (Changing the topic) How should we set the salaries for the faculty and staff?</p>
<p>Wife: The salary? Around 100,000, without meals, one person per class.</p>
<p>Principal: That's too— If we follow the regulations and use 80% as salary, then even if there are 50 people in each class, with 1.5 teachers per class, each person would need more than 300,000 per month. They're likely to argue. What do we do?</p>
<p>Wife: Do you have to worry about that? My father, sister, cousin, and old Zhang and little Li, can't they all just add their name on the rooster and teach a class or two? Besides, are you worried that the few female teachers will rebel? You really are—an *idiot*.</p>
<p>Principal: ...</p>
<p>Wife: (Suddenly concerned) Where will my little one go to school?</p>
<p>Principal: Having opened our own school, are we still afraid of missing the application deadline?</p>
<p>Wife: I don't want to, I don't want to study here. Taking up a seat—that's 80,000 yuan. Municipal schools don't require tuition! Besides, those little devils, I get a headache just seeing them. The classroom stinks, dark and gloomy, how can they study? Ugh! Ugh! It stinks. (Spitting) I feel like throwing up—spittoon (already spit on the ground)</p>
<p>Principal: (Hastily bringing the spittoon) What's wrong? My good wife! What's wrong? Too tired...</p>
