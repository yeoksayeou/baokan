<h3>美不放棄居間斡旋　馬特使亦未氣餒　美代表國務卿艾克森談話</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十一日軍〕代理國務卿艾克森本日向報界談稱：中國時局雖然嚴重，但美國不放棄其在國共間斡旋之努力。謠傳馬歇爾特使最近將回國述職之說，並非事實。馬使對於中國和平前途，並未氣餒。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十一日電〕美國當局堅決以爲美國斡旋中國和平無意終止。據本期「世界報」雜誌載稱，美國擬留於中國，直至完成和平與統一。中國前途漆黑一片，內戰倘繼續不已，馬歇爾特使最後或不免於失敗，但並不足以改變美國政策。史達林及一部份美國人主張美軍應自中國撤退，華盛頓方面決置不理。謠傳蘇有出而干涉之可能，亦絕不足信。蘇維埃化的中國，殆爲蘇聯之目的，但爲期要員。</p>
<h3>國軍續收復懷安　張垣市街大火蔓延數理　董其武兼臨時警備司令</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十二日電〕官方宣稱：國軍已繼續收復張家口西南方之懷安。但未說明該路國軍來自何方。懷安上方之平綏路重要據點陽高，迄未聞確實報吿，僅日前有國軍收復陽高傳說。</p>
<p>〔中央社歸綏十二日電〕十二戰區部隊進駐張垣後，刻董其武兼任張垣臨時警備司令，城內情况已趨安定，惟上下堡繁華街市十一日晨被共軍縱火焚燒，火勢蔓延，達四五里之長，商民房產什物，均付一炬，車站及水塔俱被澈底破壞，所有車頭車皮，亦均焚燬，城外兩飛機塲被澈底破壞，非三二日內所能修復。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平十二日電〕此間司令部發表，國軍對張家口開始攻勢迄今，適閱三星期，傳作義部已不戰而入城，一部分軍隊繼續南下，向太行山追擊，聞共軍已退向張家口西南八十里之涿鹿，南面一百八十里之禹縣，另一部份傅軍沿平綏路轉向東南，直趨宣化，謀與北上之國軍會合。張家口收復後，不僅北平至歸綏一路業已打通，且將熱河共軍與華北之連絡完全切斷。軍事當局稱，一星期內可解除保定之團。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社北平十二日電〕察主席馮欽哉，定十三日飛往張坦視察。張垣城共軍撤退時，曾敷設地雷多枚，現正由國軍淸除中。又據張家口來人談稱，過去七星期來，張垣居民疏散者達三萬之衆，其中包括共產黨幹部，邊區政府人員，鐵路人員。礦工，學生及一部份農夫。</p>
<p>〔聯合社舊金山十一日電〕張家口之陷落，對於華北共軍爲重大之打擊，因中共在該地儲有大批軍事設備。美國戰略局於一年前獲悉，中共在張家口儲有日本式步槍五十萬枝及彈華甚多，張垣地位之重要，至少與延安相等，其防務且較延安爲固。</p>

<h3>懷來一帶　仍有激戰　賀能部共軍損失過半</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平十二日電〕平綏東段懷來一帶，仍有激戰，下花園有已被國軍收復說。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平十二日電〕據接近在平親自指揮張垣軍事之國軍總參謀長陳誠將軍方面人士稱：共軍失守張家口，係由於防衛戰略上之三大錯誤，即（一）共軍對於張垣南部外圍防線懷來之實力估計過高，（二）集結懷來之共軍數量過多，致遇酣備更齊全之國軍時，損失慘重，依理彼等應將陣綫分散，而作更富流動性之行動，（三）共軍雖曾遭遇傅作　將軍之第十二戰區部隊，但顯未逆料傳部進軍如此神速。據此間所接獲之軍事報告稱：張北防軍係由察哈爾共軍總司令聶榮所率領，其後並由聶氏率隊退出張家口，大約在一個月以前，聶氏會向記者保證，共軍不顧放棄張家口一似放棄承德，渠稱：「吾人將保衛張家口至最後一兵一卒」。但共軍遭過實力龐大之國軍時，又復不抵抗而撤退。據記者探悉，曾以對日抗戰著稱並曾親自指揮大同圍攻戰之共軍宿將賀龍，在懷來指據軍事，據國軍稱：察省戰事，共軍損失最慘重者爲懷來一役，被俘，傷亡及失踪之軍隊凡四分之三，同時賀龍在懷來一役喪失之重配備亦屬最多。</p>
<h3>熱河收復各地　縣府回城辦公　北平承德通車尙有待</h3>
<p>〔中央社承德十二日電〕熱省承德，朝陽，阜新，建平，寗城，平泉，凌源，凌南，豐寗，灤平，隆化等縣，已由國軍進駐，各縣府均已回城辦公，惟偏僻鄉村治安尙未臻鞏固，劉多基主席決協助民衆組織自衛武力，由省委李守廉主持訓練。　〔又電〕國軍進駐古北口，承德後，迭傳平，承間即可通車，但承·古間山路崎嶇，山洞復被共軍用機車由兩面開進碰撞堵閉，錦州路局雖曾派員視察，因銷軌枕木奇缺，一時尙難着手，平承通車，短期尙難實現，惟承。古間公路經趕修完成。又平泉，承德段鐵路修復進度極速，預料下月竣工後，錦州·承德火車即可直達。</p>
<h3>首都婦女團體　電傳作義慰勞</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十二日電〕中國婦女憲政硏究會等十一團體，以傅長官所部進駐張垣，頃特馳電致慰，略謂：欣聞張垣收復，共軍潰竄，旌旗所指，使割據者不得逞其武力迷夢，將軍爲國干城，全國同胞深致其崇敬，謹電慰勞。</p>

<p>〔本報徐州十二日電〕魯西單縣共軍，九月中自動携械投誠者已達三千八百餘人，呈繳各種槍枝三千餘支。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南十二日電〕膠濟路共軍突又向高密增援反攻，大戰又起，共軍使用兵力達五萬餘人，據悉，係共軍解放第五師全部，解放第六師一部，警衛第五旅及膠高支隊新到第七八九各團，並新由烟台調來之第十一，師等，以最優良之裝備，自十日早三時將國軍某某等部包圍於高密及大桃哥莊等地，企岡重佔高密，截斷交通，國軍亦奮勇反擊，戰鬥極爲慘烈，雙方傷亡極重。十一日繼續血戰，午後國軍援兵趕到，東西兩路取得聯絡，積極反攻，迄晚間已將圍攻高密之共軍擊潰，分向東北，東南兩路退去，高密情形轉緩和。</p>

<h3>應即以議塲代戰塲</h3>
<p>張家口已於十一日下午由國軍收復；同時國民政府昨日已頒令通知國民大會各代表自十一月二日起，晉京向國民大會報到，以便國民大會能於十一月十二日如期開幕。這兩件事是使半個月來的局勢急轉直下，有些人會焦慮着時局或將更形惡化，甚至懷疑周恩來氏所恫嚇的「全而破裂」會成事實。惟中共方面，據稱因待延安之指示，故如何反應，京滬代表尙守沉默。政府方面，則謂國大召集，並不妨礙和平商談，而第三方面的人士原定即日進京斡旋者，暫緩啓程。就目前形勢，判斷今後政局演變的趨向，似乎尙難捉摸。</p>
<p>惟不論政局前途如何，我們敢說，中國要達到民主憲政的建國目的，祗有「以議塲代戰塲」的一條大道，舍此以外別無捷徑；縱有若干崎嶇小道，都是徒然叫人白費精神的歧路。故執政黨也好，反對黨也好，號稱第三者方面的黨派也好，誰能澈底覺悟到這一點，立刻實行放棄戰塲逐鹿的打仗，而改用議塲辯論的方法，誰就能得國人的尊重與世界的同情。我們當前幾天馬司兩使提出最後建議，即張家口休戰十天，同時即召開三人五人兩種會議，解決軍事政治一切懸案，就以爲共產黨如有大政治家，決不會錯過這個機會，而共產黨畢竟拒絕了，以致第三方面的人士縱想再行奔走，已感不及，不禁深深地爲共黨可惜。然而亡羊補牢，猶未爲晚，共產黨果眞還想在中國做一個像模像樣的反對黨（第二大黨），則張家口雖失，和談之門依然未閉，它還是有立刻丟開戰塲走入議塲的機會的。</p>
<p>共產黨今天如果還要執抝，一定認爲「全面破裂」之機運成熟，不肯放手，不讓和談可以重開，則推測他們的用意，不外兩點：（一）以爲陣地戰縱然失利，不妨改用游擎戰，自可使中國成爲一個兵連禍結的局面，以待將來的時機　（二）以爲張家口旣下，倘接受政府的要求，繼續商談改組政府，參加國大，以及整編統編等問題，得母類於「城下之盟」。其實這樣想法，全都不智。以前者論，就算眞的兵連禍結，國家受害固不必說，於共黨究有何益？而且如此執拗下去，徒然使全國人民今後痛惡共黨更甚於往昔。以後者論，共黨代表日前曾說不爭一城一地之得失，則張家口共軍之不守，共黨正不必引以爲恥，也就無所謂城下之盟。而况如果雙方以國家民族爲至上，則「兄弟鬩牆，外禦其悔」，釋嫌脩好，正是美德的表現。至若大丈夫能屈能伸，更是常人所不易學。共黨此時倘能翻然覺悟武力之不足恃，決心變計「以議塲代戰塲」，則全國人民就全鬆了一口氣，祥和氣象立即呈現，以往人們對共黨的誤解均可一掃而空，而且對共黨將感覺其過而能改。爲共黨計，此究何樂而不爲？</p>
<p>同時，我們要力勸政府，萬勿狃於最近在戰塲上打了幾次勝仗，就遺忘了以政治解決的方法達到和平統一的一貫方針。我們相信政府也必不如此。政府雖然明令公布國大代表報到日期，但決不是表示就將獨斷獨行的。政府自必依然遵照政協的決議，熱切期望各黨各派以及社會腎達都能參加國大，共同制憲。即使在國大召開以前，政府改組一舉，也祗要共黨和其他黨派願意開示名單，政府也無有不立時可以商談改組。「以議塲代戰塲」的辦法，由政府的地位來講，可以說是最安穩的政爭方法。故共黨硬要說政府存心「全面破裂」，這是不足以使人們相信的。不過我們希望政府爲更取信於一般人民和各黨各派計，不妨即在收復張家口之際，再來一次明白的宣吿，命令前綫各地的部隊，立刻暫停軍事行動至若干時日，以爲恢復政治軍事商談更大啓其門戶。必如此，政府以前必不得已而對共軍反擊的苦心，更可見諒於天下。亦必如此，共黨以及其他各黨派必將更無理由可以拒絕與政府恢復和談。</p>
<p>總之，張家口收復了，國大也召集有期了，這正是當前和平的大轉機，中共不能錯過，政府更不能放過。而第三方面居於調解斡旋的人們，尤其應該把握時機，盡力奔走，使在戰塲上的「全武行」，變成議塲上的「羣英會」！人民之幸，國家之福！</p>

<p>揚州醫院母忽貧病</p>
<p>編輯先生：我是蘇北流亡一份子，看見省立揚州醫院，對於政府解除難民疾病痛苦的功令，陽奉陰違，覺得多麼痛心呀！先是該院本規定掛號時間爲每日（星期例假除外）下午（上午普通門診）二至四時，忽然打起一精神時間有限」的官腔，改爲星期一三五了，有錢的普通人，不但星期一三五毫未變更，還可增加二四六下午時間，待遇太不平等，就是其他完全營業性質的私人醫院，也沒有一處像這樣「唯利是圖」顯而易見。茲爲多數難民請命，籲請該院迅速改進，（　）恢復原有時間，（二）手續務求簡便，從此增加救濟效能，那就感謝不盡了！（胡鳳高）</p>
<p>清寒學生求學有着</p>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>在失學問題十分嚴重的今日，我們大夏大學的同學，却在與學校合作的原則下，解決了我們的問題。今天，我們用無限的欣喜，把我們的奮門過程，報吿一般學費還沒有着落的同學們，以供他們的參考。　大夏同學，一向是散漫的，但這次爲了自己的切身問題，我們緊緊地團結在一起。</p>
<p>從敎育貸金不足分配的消息傳出後，同學們都着急了。經許多交涉，當局在各方的懇求下，就決定設一百名全免及一百名半費額。佈吿貼出後，立刻有四百多位同學簽了名，這證明學費問題是多麼嚴重地威脅着這麼多人！因爲申請的同學這麼多，原設的名額又不够了，這四百多位同學中，勢必還有好些人會得不到貸金，但我們還在要求，我們相信學校一定會考慮增加名額，使我們大夏大學的同學，沒有一個因繳不出學費而失學。</p>
<p>我們以滿腔熱誠，提供還徬徨在校門外的夥伴們，拿出勇氣來，誠懇地向你們的學校當局請求，酌量增加免費額，或設獎學金。我們相信，只要不是學店，，賢明的學校當局，一定會替同學們解決困難，我們在這裏預祝成功！（大夏大學　一羣淸寒學生）</p>
<p>職訓班離班生呼聲</p>
<p>編者先生：我是一個失學六年的靑年，勝利後蒙前招訓會分發南京臨時中學艱業，在肄業期閱，該會又設立了一個蕪湖職業訓練班，我爲了要負担生計及感到年齡高大，毅然登記，轉入該班，企岡從今學得一專門技術，以報國家，以維生計。今春四月，該班開學典禮中，主任曾謂：「本班係靑年復學就業機構，宗旨在養成一批建國中下層幹部。「同學聞之，莫不額手稱慶。迄今結業期已臨，班方負責人宣稱：「除有六名分發工作者，及六十名蘇北籍同學准予分發升學外，其他學生，願早日離班。」我雖是一個江南人，然苦痛不亞於江北，母親在舅家度日，父親已死了九年。羣與之責問，乃曰：「我沒有這個責任，不信可向敎育部詢問。」我想這大概是實在的，他也有他的苦衷。不過敎育部既然拿了鉅額經費來救濟一批失學靑年，而不予以澈底，又有什麼用呢？徒耗人力物力財力於不顧而此輩靑年今後是否個個能復學，就業，所本到的證書，既不能投考學校。又不能申請工作，呌我們往那裏去？我們對國家的一片熱忱，恐怕就星要消滅了。〔馬如山〕</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十一日電〕新任商務部長哈里受昨日在陸海軍及國務院代表聯合會議席上發表演說，根據其從前　蘇大使任內搜集之情報，說明蘇聯外交政策之動向。略謂，史達林元帥及蘇聯其他領袖，深信資本主義與共產制度不能並立於同一世界。蘇聯因有此種信念，故決定採取一項政策，意欲出其全力，阻礙英美對於解決全世界政治問題之種稱努力。以故總統羅斯福而論，本來相信美蘇雖因制度不同，但仍有和平相處可能。但在戰爭最後數月，故總統之見解迅速改獎。羅總統今日倘若猶在人世，必將推行杜魯門總統與貝爾納斯國務卿之對蘇政策無疑也。以本人而論，亦因歐戰末期及勝利後引起之種種困難，不得不改變原來之信念。本人此際相信，蘇職之全面獨裁制度與美國之民主制度格格不入，換言之，即蘇聯禁止一切自由，美國則承認民主自由是也。共產主義確爲世界之眞正危機，一經接觸，即受其傳染。是以美國現行政策採取得大警戒，對於蘇聯之意向表示懷疑，以便最後保衛和平云。</p>

<h3>適應現代化戰爭　蘇軍大規模革新</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十二日電〕本社駐莫斯科記者唐東，甫自該地返國，以下乃其所述紅軍改革之情形：</p>
<p>莫斯科若干外國軍事武官皆謂，蘇聯軍隊正從事戰後大規模之改革，蘇最高軍事當局對近代戰其，尤其是原子彈。雷達。噴氣及火箭推進飛機等，從事最詳細審愼之研究，俾使陸海空三軍適應最新式之科學發明，同時大規模之軍事復員工作，去完成之期尙遠。蘇聯之東西邊疆，戰役旣有拓展，因此軍事上之需要亦隨之增加。</p>
<p>陸軍流綫化</p>
<p>若干外國觀察家曾吿記者，謂蘇聯陸軍正採取流綫化之方式，從事整編，對於原子彈之效能，復詳細予以分析，以供參考。除擬增加軍隊之流動性及獨立性外，並考慮增加基地供應及後備。紅軍對坦克隊及砲隊極爲注意，但對步兵仍諷之爲作戰之主體。蘇聯空軍竭力研究英美空軍戰時之戰術，蘇空軍之重轟炸機隊實力較遜，作戰知識亦較欠缺，蘇空軍戰略家目前之主要研究對象，乃爲複雜之大規模空戰攻勢學。蘇聯對於戰後飛機型式之進步，素守秘密，外界知者極鮮。　數星期前莫斯科舉行空軍節展覽時，當史達林元帥及政治局統帥部人員檢閱之際，外人始得略睹蘇聯新機之形式，受檢之飛機中有最新式之四引擎轟炸機及噴氣與火箭推進戰鬥機，蘇聯海軍亦在積極擴大中。　官方及報紙所載權威方面之消息，於此均有指示。造船所之數量及面積均有增加，蘇專家且自獲自英美及前敵國之艦隻，研究其特點，波羅的海及遠東新獲之海軍基地，均在大事擴充中，蘇聯至今仍認海空軍乃紳大陸軍之輔助。官方及報紙之言論均稱，蘇聯陸軍爲世界唯一囌維埃社會主義國家之骨幹，認係世界各地無產階級之希望。政府曾吿人民，將保持並改良紳大之陸軍，以防止資本主義家及反動派之侵略，資本主義始終被認爲侵略戰之淵源，故資本主義一日存在於世界，紅軍實力必須保持其紳大。　蘇聯復毫不忽略黨化軍隊之宗旨，該項工作近來更加緊進行，同時對軍紀標準之提高，亦極爲注意，絕對服從爲紅軍之口號，若干目前曾有新軍律頒佈，以完成此項目標，軍官之訓練，猶絲毫不稍懈怠，戰時獲得實地經騐之靑年軍官，今復忙於在書本中搜索理論。蘇軍人數乃極嚴密之秘密，今在蘇國內各處雖可見復員之現象，但當局至今尙無統計數字發表、因此外人即有猜測亦殊欠準確，當聞之估計數字乃二百萬人左右。</p>
<h3>葡政局不安　軍人譁變爲革命前奏　蕯拉柴總理地們動搖</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十一日電〕外傳西班牙軍隊在葡萄牙哥印伯拉城發生叛變之後，已越過葡國邊境，此說頃由此間負責人士予以否認，並謂吾人現正等待哥印伯拉叛變結果之消息英國與葡萄牙國向來保持友好關係，已有數百年之久，故對於該國之和平與秩序自必特別關切。外傳葡內閣總理薩拉柴之信譽業已發生動搖，官方並未加以否認，可能引起內閣辭職問題，亦未可知。此在外交界人士則認爲內政部長蒙尼茲上校，灤得薩拉柴總理之信任，有繼任內閣總理之可能。但在另一方面，葡總統加蒙那深得陸軍擁護，或可能由其組織一軍政府，要之，薩拉柴總理一旦去職，葡國局勢必將益趨艱難，殆可斷言。　〔路透社里斯本十二日電〕據未證實之報告稱，葡萄牙陸軍已向薩拉柴政府提出最後通牒，要求交出職權，否則當由陸軍接收全國之控制。此一報吿之傳出，正值里斯本及全國他處因奧博多之葡置於星期四譁變，而採取之警戒措施已漸趨鬆弛之際。里斯本與奧博多間之交通一度中斷，茲已恢復，奉政府之召而出動之軍隊仍駐在里斯本。薩拉柴總理官邸週圍架設之機關槍仍未不撤除，政府官報雖謂奧博多之譁變參加者僅七十人，已吿敉平，然觀察家則信此乃全國革命運動之前奏。若干人士且謂革命運動將在葡京爆發，此次譁變純係軍人發動，外傳有共黨參加之說，殊難置信。現可靠之報吿尙付缺如，僅悉已有多人被捕，以後將續有被捕者。迄至目前爲止，對此事發表評論者僅半官之「曼哈日報」一家，該報稱，叛軍爲破壞國家努力之人，不必予以憐惜。</p>

<p>〔聯合社紐約十二電〕「紐約時報」今日載稱：蘇聯反對設立國際常備軍，中聯介國機構用以維持世界和平。蘇聯係反對於發生任何危機之前，撥派軍隊歸聯合國機構使用，此節已具見蘇代表團於九月間提交安理會軍事委會之意見書。其中主張各點，幾與軍事委會美英中法四國代表完全不同。蘇聯對於聯合國憲草規定設立維持世界和平警備隊之解釋，認爲此項軍隊非至實際需用之時，不應指定歸安理會節制</p>

<h3>六年前一血案　白俄團丁槍殺孤軍　兇手米奇亞可夫於勝利後被捕　地院昨日初審供詞閃爍</h3>

<p>昨日下午地院第八刑庭初次審理，米奇亞可夫供稱：年二十五歲，一九四〇年加入萬國商團，民國二十九年九月十八日被派赴星加坡路孤軍營服務，該日適爲「九一八」紀念日，被告奉命値第一崗崗位，是日上午十一時許，即有市民約百餘人，圍集孤軍營四週，孤軍營士兵多人攀登圍牆，煽動羣衆，於是路人羣起向崗警圍毆，當時形勢極爲緊張，被吿警惶失措，擬開朝天槍示警，因神輕緊張不能把持，故當時不知殺人，至翌日，報載孤軍營士兵一名被　斃云」。被吿米亞可夫對殺人一點，旣不否認，亦不承認。庭上再訊證人喬麥林（白俄商團副隊長）及羅白諾夫（當年偵查該案之負責人），兩證人皆稱當時並非目擊，然聞槍聲被吿辯護律師劉劍剛提出二點：（一）該日於米奇亞可夫開槍後之三分鐘，第七崗拉希合維支亦曾開槍一響，故何玉相所中之彈，是否米奇亞可夫所射發尙待證實。（二）根據孤軍營警衛訓令第二十二條第二項第一款載。「崗警如遇脅擊，或防止强力之脅逼，與武裝之被解除時，毋庸得長官之命令，可開槍射擊」。故被吿之開槍，不能構成罪行。並請求承辦此案之檢察官季蘇到庭提供證據，要求改期再審，俾便有充分時間收集證據。庭上准其所請，改本月二十二日下午二時再審。</p>
<h3>不堪回首話當年</h3>
<p>按彼時日軍逞威本市四郊一再向當時之工部局交涉接管孤軍雖遭拒絕，然工部局對孤軍營之管制，越加嚴厲，派白俄商團於孤軍營四週嚴密戒備，於九月十四日因商團於孤軍營某出入口處架置鐵絲網，孤軍不滿，因起衝突，白俄商團曾向孤軍施放催淚彈及用自來水噴射，並將孤軍營封鎖，此項糾紛實爲血案之前奏，當案發後已故孤軍營謝晋元團長曾發表沉痛之聲明，略謂：「本營靠馬路之圍牆，牆上設有鐵絲網，牆下爲澡堂，弟兄在此說話，習以爲常，本日（十八日）上午十一時五十分，有士兵數名，在鐵絲綱空隙處向外說話，殊料距約數步之馬路站崗白俄衛兵，舉槍瞄準制止，弟兄置之不理，該白俄即開槍射擊，彈由前額入貫穿腦部，立時畢命，同時站於左邊另一白俄，亦提槍瞞準射擊，震傷一名，生死非所顧，余等已準備隨時爲公理正義及世界文明而犧牲，決不惜任何代價，奮鬥到底，余茲向上海民衆請求，吾人犧牲後，請收吾人屍骨，歸還我政府…」當時孤軍處境之艱苦，由此文吿中可見其一斑，勝利後今日，舊案重提，能不令人緬懷乎。</p>

<p>八時正，一扇大門開處，走出了兩個穿黃制服的法警，後面跟隨着一個面色萎黃的女人。穿一件紅底藍橫條旗抱，外罩淡藍色短呢火衣。脚穿肉色絲襪，白褐鑲嵌的雙色皮鞋。頭髪剪得很短，乾枯得一無光澤。一手拿着一只網綫袋，一手用手帕掩住了嘴，再戴上一副闊邊的太陽眼鏡，就這樣，她低頭跨出女監的大門。網綫袋隨即由親友接去，她默默的低頭跟隨法警到盧家　地檢處，去辦理出獄的手續。</p>
<p>這就是袁美雲，當年紅極一時的「小女伶」，又是銀幕上翩翩年少的「化身姑娘」和傾國傾城的「西施」！然而看到那因營養和消化不良所引起的萎黃虛腫和滿面的瘰　，對這昔年光芒萬丈的明星，誰能不諳然神傷！</p>
<p>踏上了預備好的企明運輸公司的十輸吉普卡，直駛向地檢處。在車上她一直低着頭，黑色的太陽眼鏡和白色的小手帕，掩蓋了她三分之二的臉部。新聞記者試用各種方式來逗引她說話，然而都失敗了，她始終不言不語。</p>
<p>八點廿五分，她到了地檢處。跳下車子，又被押進刑事被吿候審室。因好奇而到那小室的鐵柵洞去張望她的人，川流不息。袁美雲——這個被囚居了六月，將要恢復自由的人，這時正心緒不定的低頭在裏面來去徘徊。經歷過一度失去自由的滋味的人，才知道自由是怎樣的可貴，這時的一分一秒，在她是多麼長的時間啊！</p>
<p>記者們想找她談話，她本人一直無言，由受托來接她的辯護律師轉吿：「今日心亂如蔴，不知從何說起，待改日再談」。</p>
<p>有人在咕嚕：「人怕出名猪怕奘。」換別人，那有今日這許多人來看她，包圍她的人？又有人在不平的嘆息：把她關在這小室裏，讓人們不斷的到鐵當口去張望，不和動物園裏看動物一樣？這是多麼殘酷的一種虐待！</p>
<p>好容易等到九時廿五分，又被提出到庭。傳邦檢察官升座詢問姓名年齡籍貫住址等等，袁答：「二十九歲，原籍河北住中正中路恒業里十二號。本年四月十二日被捕，四月十六日進看守所，由地院判刑六月。」檢察官告以執行期已滿，今日開釋。出去以後不要再吃了。袁低頭無語。繼之，打手印具結，檢察官在紙上重震的寫下了「開釋」兩字。這囚居六月的影星，至此重又恢復自由，時爲九時卅分。她低頭匆匆跨出法庭，親友上前攙扶，一同跳進了早已預備好的淡灰色簇新的自備汽車。她的老母親從早就坐在汽車裏守候到現在，美雲倒入她懷裏，車子開動，就這樣飛馳而去了。</p>

<h3>市黨部謝書記長談今後工作方針</h3>
<p>市黨部新任書記長謝仁釗氏對今後黨務方針發表意見，略謂：本人奉命襄助，固辭不獲，殊感惶懼。然以黨務工作爲黨人對黨之一種州義務，決非作官可此，今後仍當一秉對社會服務精神，從事努力各種社會事業。至工作方針，本人之意不外下述四端：（一）以政黨作風作政黨活動，國民黨本質決非一黨專政的黨，終極目的在於還政於民。國大召開在即，國家已臨憲政時期，本黨今後當以政黨作風，作政黨活動，使政策更能深入羣衆，獲取羣衆擁護。（二）以人民的意志作宣傳之主張。民化國家之主權在民，今日民主國家之政然，先須把握多數人民之意志而後製爲政策，公諸社會，以促政府的實施，中國建國復興首重民生，本市黨務宣傳，將以有益國計民生爲第一，以反映人民之意志。而文化敎育尤爲改進生活之要素。當亦不能忽視。（三）以黨政革新運動，爭取民主政治的進步。以期蕭清貪污，轉移網氣。（四）以研究自由的態度，與合黨派保持合理之接觸，民主與自由不可分離，民主與法治尤應聯成一體。蔑親自由者決非民主，破壞法紀者亦非自由。政黨的自由必須互相尊重，國家的法紀尤賴大衆維持。政黨主張縱有不同，態度必須友善。如此可以使多數人民知所取捨，使各黨派間保持聯系，共同爲社會服務，爲人民造福。謝氏繼談：今後國事，自以　　民大會，制定憲法爲達成民主憲政之唯一步驟。國大業已定期召開，正祈待各方之努力。</p>

<h3>無限酸辛無限慘痛　中國著名小提琴家費曼爾小姐在奮鬥着　她在人生旅程中遭遇可歌可泣的悲劇　四根絃索裏傳來曲曲斷腸聲</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕馬丁路得曾說過，「音樂是上帝賜給人們最好的禮物。」可是，當我們在接受這件美妙動人的禮物時，我們也許會忘了世界上有多多少少這禮物的傳遞者，他們曾化了幾許艱難困苦，辛酸奮鬥，而把精神上的糧食貢獻給別人。記者在這裏要介紹的一位中國名小提琴家費曼爾小姐，就是其中的一個。</p>
<p>如果你對音樂發生興趣，如果你在重慶成都躭過，你一定會知道或聽到費曼爾這名字。我不願意把費小姐的藝術，大捧而特捧，可是我敢說費小姐在今天中國音樂的圈子內，有這樣的造就和地位，絕對不是一件容易的事，尤其是在她人生旅程中所遭遇的可歌可泣的悲劇，是値得我們同情和敬佩的。費小姐的丈夫空軍第三大隊隊長曾培復少校的慘死，在她生平是一個最大的打擊，可是三年來，費小姐爲了加强抗戰空軍的勇氣，始終沒有忘記自己應負的責任，繼續不斷地，各處奔走，把一曲曲斷腸之淚的結品，從她的四根絃索間帶給他們。前天雙十節，費小姐近應杭州筧橋空軍軍官學校之請，特地主持一個小小音樂團，前往參加演奏。記者很僥倖得到這個機會，隨同前去欣賞，並和費小姐作了一席談話。</p>
<p>父親很早就過世</p>
<p>費曼爾小姐是杭州人，今年才二十六歲，父親曾任當地某校敎師，但很早就過世，費小姐的母親，把她的期望，全部寄在她這位獨生的女兒身上。在她六歲的時候，就開始督促她學習鋼琴，到她十二歲的時候，又給她學習小提琴，那時候，費小姐的家仍住在杭州，可是，每個週末，她都到上海來跟着這兒有名的奧籍小提琴家普度希加敎授勸習小提琴，一直到今天，她還在努力地隨着老教授研究。在國立藝專，費小姐曾攻讀了六年，但畢業後她始終未放棄繼續學習。民國二十六年，她在上海參加倫敦音樂院考試，曾得到該院敎員文憑。</p>
<p>慈母悒　復見背</p>
<p>抗戰開始後，費小姐到了內地，七年前和曾培復少校結婚。可是，也就爲了這件事，她遇到了第二件不幸的遭遇。那時候她才十九歲，費小姐的母親，爲了她女兒的前途，不希望她太早結婚，影響她音的前途，以致時常悒鬱，竟至在第二年息腦充血逝世。</p>
<p>費小姐在痛心之餘，祇能以音樂上的造詣來安慰九泉之下的慈母，一方面也是受到了她丈夫的鼓勵。「我的丈夫，始終是鼓勵我好好上進，他的誠意，督促，使我再也不敢放鬆學習」費小姐這樣說。接着，費小姐開始了她的悲劇。</p>
<p>夫婿駕機演慘劇</p>
<p>曾少校是空軍軍官學校第六期的畢業生，在抗戰初年，曾參加過四十幾次作戰，歷建奇功。當第一次敵人驅逐機來侵略，我空軍上空迎戰的那次，曾少校就是其中的一位。那一塲惡戰四十幾位空軍將士犧牲了一半，其他一半中有重傷的，有半途而退回的，惟有曾少校一人繼續追擊，平安歸來，曾得到特級嘉獎。可是上蒼無情，三年前，曾少校正在印度克拉茲當訓練官，有一次和幾位盟軍表演訓練飛行技術，他的飛機竟不幸失事，墮地殞命，這時，他才二十八歲。我們可以想像得到那時候在成都的費小姐心中如何感覺！費小姐是一個多情的女孩子，可是她是勇敢的。</p>
<p>從那時起，她帶了她三歲的女兒小曼麗和剛生的小男孩，還有她那生命另一寄托的小提琴，在血和淚的痛苦中掙扎。</p>
<p>孩兒患病竟夭亡</p>
<p>去年冬天，費小姐到了上海，我實在不敢相信世界上有那末慘痛的悲劇，可是事實擺在你眼前。今年新年的時候，她那活像他爸爸的男孩也竟患腦膜炎而與世長辭了！像泉水一般的淚從費小姐兩眼中湧了下來，我再有沒有勇氣開口了。「空軍裘面的人對我是再好沒有了，可是我內心的痛苦，是沒有東西可以來彌補的」，費小姐短短的兩句話，該比我用任何悲哀的文字來描寫還要深切，還要悲痛！</p>
<p>「可是，爲了我那六歲的女兒（現在已開始學習鋼琴），爲了我死去的母親，丈夫和孩子，我還要活下去。」費小姐使我感動得說不出話。</p>
<p>準備赴美求深造</p>
<p>費小姐現在除了繼續練習提琴外，還跟名敎授希斯林學唱，她準備去美國深造，正在替她女兒辦護照，因爲這是她最後和最親切的一個伴侶了。費小姐是非常聰敏的，她不但能說流利的英語，還會說一口俄文，因爲她從小就常住在她老師老敎授普度希加的家裏。此外她還會駕駛飛機和汽車。</p>
<p>費小姐的確是一個萬分不幸的人，可是，在這次戰爭中，世界上有多多少少的人比妳更不幸，更可憐。妳還是那末年輕，妳有着無限的前途，上帝賦給妳天才，這不是侮個不幸人都能得到的。國家需要妳這樣的人才，我們深深地希望你「收拾起痛苦的呻吟，獻出你赤子的心情」。爲着你的理想，勇往直前。祝妳成功！（上圖爲費小姐近影本報攝）</p>

<h3>楊文道宣判無罪　十年寃獄一朝平反　聞判後頻鞠躹躬感極落淚　對當日偽證警探　將進行檢舉控訴</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日下午一時三刻，楊文適偕其子漢枝步入高院第二法院，沉默無語，表情極緊張靜候其命運之最後決定。叫時半正、法處旁　度上　　突起，楊文道亦滿而笑容，頻向堂上鞠躬，安然　開法院，已成一自由之人、</p>
<p>昨高院係開合議庭審理，審判長爲　　　，推事王可　，張世傑，　　官江公亮；　文這之辯護律師仍爲唐　羣。審訊於二時一刻開始，枸問甚嚴、　中頗有爲楊文這不安者。四時十分宣吿辨論終結，諸法官郎退　評議，四時半，法官重新就位，　審判長面含笑容，就坐後，　起立宣判，　讀主文曰：「楊文進殺人一案。　判法撤消、楊文　無罪。」楊文　開判向處上鞠躬致　時，因惑激已極，淚光　然！勞聽席上在宣判時寂無　　，聽判後當　如　。　可　推事亦不　　　　前傾向楊含笑頷首。當記者向楊氏父子　手進　時，彼　成　　　　謝之枕。　　　律　　因功　　滿歡喜無限。</p>
<p>二時一刻，法庭傳呼楊文道，空氣突見緊張。公案上堆積案卷五大疊、每疊均高達尺餘，審判長因視綫受限，特命法警於公座後另設一椅，堆置此項證件，然因堆積過高，有搖欲仆之狀。</p>
<p>楊艾　身穿米色西裝，頗爲整潔，與記着去冬往獄中接見時，幾已判若二人，足登黃色皮　，據楊文　　，十年前被捕時，即穿此鞋，在捕房中，日警即曾命其脫下後返鞋向彼頭部亂打逼供，而使彼　厥者也。宣吿無罪之楊文道</p>
<h3>被捕後飽受非刑　陰謀逼誣吳鐵城</h3>
<p>庭上首詢年籍，楊答五十二歲，廣東中山人。旋問上訴意旨，楊即答稱：中山秀雄被暗殺案，彼實完全不知。民國二十五年四月十九日晨十時，彼因出門送殯，於所住弄堂中遇譚勝在其門首逡巡，見楊時面色立頳，狀極不安。楊即問彼來此何爲，譚答訪友，本意走過三四家門面後，與楊同行之陳榮生回首見譚正向後招手，立有穿西服者三四人趨前，從後擒住雙手，立上手銬，架上一上有SMP字樣之汽車，駛至狄思威路捕房。彼當時即問被捕原因，有日籍警官答稱慢慢即知。當晚日軍即夢末移提至司令部，捕房當局未允，即送中央捕房，次早即解地院，當日未提公訴。後一日，葉海生被捕，同送公堂，指爲係暗殺　水兵中山秀雄之凶手，楊因實不知情，始終未肯承認。彼於被捕之後，捕房曾往其家搜查，有一西捕搜得一書，向彼一揚問彼是否己物，彼即谓爲係彼　藏手槍之書，而原書實係西文。叶海生被補後，每天午夜，必提至四樓「特別間」，飽歷非刑，滕部因裸跪碎石，竟致潰爛。補房中人吿彼，如能供出係吳前市長鐵城及當時之江海關監督唐海安主使，並由吳等給）洋十五萬元作暗殺代價，即可免刑。但彼寗願每夜受刑，始終未屈。不意地院開審時，竟不准發言，即判死刑，實爲寃枉，故不服而提上訴。</p>
<h3>審判長詢問　歷時一句鐘</h3>
<p>於是審判長即開始周密而銳利之詢問，達一小時餘二楊文道光述洪順互助會係於十九年成立，爲　善機關，關辦學校，介紹職業，葉海生亦該會會員之一,經費之來源則爲各會員公攤。楊對與葉海生曾在洪順會抽籤決定動手暗殺中山秀雄事，矢口否認。關於挖孔藏手槍之書，庭上問；你那本是什麼書？答：是英文，不識何書。問：是否實用物理學？答：當時不知。問：你即不識英文，何以用英文書？答：是棧房裏檢來的。問：後來見的是中文的物理書？答：載　時曾細閱，　知此書</p>
<p>並非已物</p>
<p>問：你非軍人，何以又有手槍？答：此係前文鴻恩　長提起過，由李　借給我，但固廣東之前，此槍即已交還李　。間：何以放在書裏？答：因家巾小孩多，由族姪楊建中談起可放入挖孔之書內。問：有子彈否。答：有六發。問：以前何以承認，答：葉海生會承認，但我絕未承認。問：華海生何以承認？答：　後曾於獄中吿我，係熬刑木過。日人係有組織的呌葉　　，再呌我咬吳市長唐海安。問：你何以知道？答；西探意　，</p>
<p>咬出二人</p>
<p>即可免酷刑。問：葉海生表演你去過否？答：每次均未知道，葉關在成都路捕房，我關在中央捕房。問：當年有證人中有一張珠？答二張琛磁建巾，曾元佳·鄭偉民。譚勝等曾組　體，甘心受日人指使，造成事件，嫁禍中國，其後張琛因良心發現，始將過去情形供明，請曾元曾吿彼等，如能提到楊艾　，大家就有綫化。惟張琛當夜關在捕房，即又受酷刑。問：你如何知道？答：聽張琛後來在堂上講的。問：中文物理學不是你的，有何證據？答：從未到過我手，無從知進。問：</p>
<p>書中挖孔</p>
<p>處油跡見不否？答：此書其後曾送眞茹檢騐，據書記官在堂上說有油跡，是剛從槍上脫下來的，但槍手早已乾了。孔中有PC二印，檢騐　也說是臨時壓出來的。書上有十四指紋，與我的指紋亦無一相同。楊文道述及葉海生時，　　探曾　其跪於葉前，用楊之　痛擊楊頭，膝鑿下又勢小石塊，逼楊承認。</p>
<p>江檢察官　論吿三點</p>
<p>訊　後，江檢察官即起而論吿三點：（三）原審謂楊文道敎唆葉海生殺害中山秀雄，最重要之根據爲業之口供，但葉之供詞，前後頗不一致，時而謂盟楊有關係，時而又謂無開。至謂葉之供詞出於刑求，首被拳摩肋骨，口灌涼水，按之當時檢騐報吿，情形似屬可靠，且受酷刑，恐尚不止一次，其供詞顚倒錯亂，不足採取。（二）楊文道</p>
<p>自衛手槍之物理審係英文本，　抄　之貯　行凶手槍之物理學則爲中文，外表雖　相似，其實並不吻合，且沙出之審，有　近挖空　跡。張琛作證時謂係曾　郭惠　等欲謀賞格、串通陷害，而曾兄已於另　中證明難已成爲漢奸，與日人發生關係，專門利用日人勢力，在虹口一帶橫行不法，故張琛供詞，頗有可採，（三）海生之演習犯案情形，確係受有威脅。且楊文通犯罪之動機，　判謂楊欲打死日人，在虹口造成其組會之勢力。但是時虹口係在日人勢力範團之內，打死日人，祗促該會爲日人消滅而已。蓋當時情形特殊，日人不惜犧牲，實欲造成嚴重事態而已。綜上所論，檢察官認爲楊文道犯罪嫌疑，不甚充分。</p>
<h3>律師辯護</h3>
<p>唐律帥繼起辯護稱：今日審判本案，己在自由空氣之中，然當年本案發生時，情勢實甚嚴重，虹口居民，紛紛遷移，當時軍政部長何應欽。市長吳鐵城，均特闢謠安民。當日張檢察官爲維護中國法律之尊嚴，論吿時會堅持被吿應判無罪，而此一星期內，空氣即極度緊張，乃至法院撤消辯論終結，更爲審判，被吿　被判死刑—按</p>
<p>當時事實</p>
<p>（一）法階檢走，死者距開槍人僅五公分左右，而葉海生之表演　乃距離　丈。當時　兇　逃走之皮鞋店生胡詳和供稱　身出與兇手相似之衣服，尤　淮意。（二）捕房律師張師竹曾嘗抄得之書爲美文，但後又變　中女。（三）　表演時係叫五人推來推去，是嚴「導演一，不是「表演」。（四）　是洪　會會員，楊是會　，故日人欲　葉咬楊，再　楊評　長官。（五）不意楊係　　，堅不肯招，遂又生一計，　迫葉海生承認，即作爲定案。唐律師</p>
<p>辯論完畢時，企　中央黨部致　　邱　證明，請早　　無譯，　往領　。楊文道吏　力　　　長平反其十年　　。　　　吿　　終精，追　　　後，重　　　　楊文道　之判決．</p>
<p>據　　　羅；俟本案判決確定後，楊文道不特將　吿曾元等僞證之　，　將槍當日捕房　用非　之警探，凡曾受者輩茶毒者，　　　　　　　供　實。聞　　　並有代楊向政府要求寃獄賠償之意。</p>

<h3>王部長談紡管會　吳主委下週可接事　配銷範圍逐步擴大</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部部長王　五，昨日下午主持中國紡建公司董事會例會後，接見記者。承吿：紡織事業管理委員會主任委員一職，確已由吳國楨市長兼任。政府鑒於加强紗布聯合配銷機構，單恃紡管會及各有關同業公會負責，尙嫌力量不够。例如各工廠用電量之調整，與市公用局有關。工人工作時間恢復戰前狀態，與社會有關。故爲求工作澈底有效計，地方政府勢須多負責任。故雖明知吳市長公務繁忙，仍　勉爲其難，出任主委。渠曾爲平抑紗布價格事宜，昨午與吳市長一度交換意見，雙方觀點，均極一致。至紡管會副主委，仍由李升伯兼任。此外復添聘中央銀行業務局局長林鳳苞爲紡管會委員。原主委束雲章，因兼任紡建公司總經理，精力不濟，對主委一職，提出辭呈，惟仍兼任委員。新主委及委員，下週內當可接事</p>
<p>對第一次棉紗聯合配銷經過，王部長認爲尙稱滿意。惟第二次聯合配銷情形，不盡合理想。王部長稱：渠於上次來滬時，曾與各廠酌定廿支紗每件最高配銷價爲一百五十五萬元，只能跌入此限度，而不能超出。然棉紗市價，仍跳漲不已。考其原因，實銷多，原料貴，固爲原因；惟參加聯合配銷之各紗廠，對配價是否忠實，亦負相當責任。綠聞若十紗廠，且兼設紗號。故一手雖因配紗而似形　蝕，殊不知一手仍由其所設之紗號　　。類此情事，非予嚴格澈查不可。現政府對聯合配銷之原則，總望能加强機構，配銷範圍，擬自紗擴大至布。配銷地點，擬自上海而擴及外埠。此蓋因全國整個缺少紗布，不得不進而謀聯合配銷之合理化，而由紡管會主持其事。上海爲全國生產棉紗棉布最多之地，各地紗布，大多仰給於此，故望能先自上海做起，以收穩定外埠紗有市價之效。茲者吳市長出任紡管會主委，以市府力量，協助抑平紗布市價，必能收更大之效果</p>
<p>又據吿：工商督導處組織辦法，自經通過後，現正積極籌備中，大致本月內可告成立云。</p>
<p>王部長在滬公畢，將於今晚十時，乘夜車返京。</p>
<h3>華股市氣渙散　熱門略有點綴</h3>
<p>華股昨每况愈下，晨開時雖現微昻，但大戶及新買依然絕迹，是以漲勢曇花一現不久復由高而　，塲內交易清閑。僅永紗信和兩　檯前，尙形熱鬧，新光景　略有點綴外，餘者倍形淸淡，信和由一六四號，全力供售，是以籌碼開展，幾與永紗並駕齊驅，中途絕少反抗，過程在平靜狀况中，逐節下挫，迄十一時二十五分後，始由北帮逢低補進，永紗一度自七八二元拉上十元。但爲時仍極短促，十一時半後復一瀉而下，近午都現低價，新光有銀行界購買，雖跌而尙穩，結果較前收計永紗景　新光勤興美亞各跌十分之一，信和大通跌半成弱，冷股中統益中紡內衣新亞公司中絲平平，榮　在有進少出之情形下，再好半成弱，餘者均吿小挫，總成交額爲八七一萬股，元老股以及塲外各股跌落者居多。</p>
<p>外股亦疲境重演，無力自振，除會德　外，各股均吿下游，交易有限，緒果較前收計英聯紙業怡　各跌半成光景，會德豐平平、餘者都吿微跌。</p>
<h3>紡建配售後　人造絲轉疲</h3>
<p>紡建公司昨日配售絲織廠人造絲，每一織機，約可配售二包，比上期增加半包，故昨日人造絲黑市又吿疲軟，一二〇號天橋有光，上午喊四百二十五萬元，最大二十八萬元、下午做四百二十萬元，較上日短十五萬元，雜牌有光同樣隨跌，半光貨缺較俏，昨做小十萬元，廠經堅持看好，昨CDE各級，均喊大五萬元，干經新單五担貨討價二百七十五萬至八十萬元，但無成交，綢貨穩定，無甚甚變化，華錦縐高檔做三千三百元，次貨做三千一百五十元。</p>
<h3>金市買戶踴躍　美鈔黑市仍舊</h3>
<p>烚赤昨逢週六，人心仍榮，廣帮力購，平後盤俏，晨開二一六萬五，上塲時甚爲平和，在二一六萬五左右掙扎甚久，入後廣帮購納，逐漸向上，十時後央行以二一七萬五之價，配給一〇〇條，央行雖有拋售，買戶倍感殷切，良以客銷甚暢，散戶復存奢望，近午曾回升至二二〇萬以上，午刻在二一九萬五左右徘徊，午後繼續上進，回升至二二一萬外，結果較前收漲起五萬二，飾金掛高至念三萬四，紋銀銀元均本無變化，暗息價仍爲一角半至一角八不等。</p>
<p>外幣甚爲堅定，港市申鈔低落，人心仍傾向於搜買也，美鈔雖呌三五〇〇元買進，仍無交易可做，暗盤中約四一〇〇元至四三〇〇元，略有成交，結果較前收無甚變化，港票則初平繼堅，結果較前收回升二十元，港匯九一〇元至九三〇元，印匯一一二〇元至一一四〇元，英匯一四八〇〇元至一五〇〇〇元，成交均不見暢，美匯牌價未更仍仍無成交。</p>
<h3>公債平談</h3>
<p>公債昨求供較爲均衡，成交不過三百萬元，過程遂倍形平和，統丙晨開二〇五〇元，高價不過二一一〇元，中途曾低至一九七〇元，最後在二〇二〇元掙扎，結果較前收微挫十元，甲乙丁戊各小五〇元。</p>
<h3>中砂生砂微緊</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢穩定，上落無多，公會劃盤現貨廿號中砂白初爲十四萬〇五百元，後爲十四萬元，生砂赤十二萬〇五百元，均見微緊，號貨有油頭帮開出黃崗靑十一萬三四千元，普通棉赤十一萬二千元至四千元，共計二百除包，廣帮開出淡色海南赤一百五十包，十一萬三千元，祝靑數十包，十萬〇八千元至五千元，建帮開出刁靑仍爲十萬〇八千元。</p>
<h3>客幫裏足紗市疲弱　棉布雖跌腳地尙堅</h3>
<p>昨日紗市　　下游，報載存紗登記消息，因是引起業中人吐售，客帮趨趄不前，採辦稍弱，致價　跌五七萬元，然收市有人乘廉吸買，故又復入堅穩之局，昨市四十二支　鳳做三百卅六萬元，較前小至七八萬元，二十支重磅雙馬做二百廿二萬元，輕磅爲二百十三四萬元，亦小七八萬，其他各牌紗市亦均小　。</p>
<p>布市較昨日亦小千元左右，客帮及本街銷路寥寥，同業以吳市長隔昨召集棉織業談話會剴切曉諭，且前週上漲已登峯造極，昨日紡建公司掛牌並未稍降，但市塲喊價龍頭細布九萬元，後即八萬九千元成交，喇叭童細布七萬七千元，一般廠商因藍鷄細布適用較大，且已久未開售，爭相申請，價開七萬九千元，故布市雖見小　，但供應未見圓滑，脚地仍屬堅硬。</p>
<h3>申請南運廠商　紡管派員復查</h3>

<h3>司的林漂精粉燒碱　貨缺價俏</h3>
<p>司的林澳洲久無到貨，近値旺銷，價格飛漲，在六七月間，每袋一百八十磅，價爲十八萬元，現價已達五十五六萬之間，燒碱因各客帮紛紛來滬採辦，本市印染工廠，印花漂染整理，無一不需燒碱，各方儘量扒吸，致執貨者咸望待價而沽，漂粉精，本年進口極少，但漂白粉爲美國戰時之剩餘物資，一度大量湧到，用戶亦以價廉而樂於採用，現以漂白粉消耗殆盡，價亦飛漲，故漂粉精又成奇貨可居，在本年二三月間，每桶（百市斤）價六十七萬元，迨至六七月間，曾跌至十一二萬元，六月底銀根奇緊時，曾低至每桶九萬元，現則億利頓貨已成有價無貨，美貨及日貨，每桶一一二磅，價爲三十八九萬元，現貨頗難買到。</p>

<h3>貨物稅是便利廠商的稅務署方面如此表示</h3>
<p>〔南京十二日一時電〕自財政部貨物稅釐訂新法征收後，皮毛，茶葉，水泥等業，咸感負担過重，曾具文向中央各有關部會，要求减低，現據稅務署方面稱：貨物稅之征收，係最高當局核准，且經過立法手續，該署爲行政機關，在未接舉其他明令以前，仍當極力推行，且貨物稅之中，開征新稅不多，而稅率除奢侈用品，及不必需貨物較重外，其他各類均不算高，對於外貨之　入，除關稅外，一律同樣課征貨物稅，使無偏倚，貨物稅之征收，對各廠商實爲一種便利，因旣征貨物稅後，即可運銷全國，各種地方上之特產稅，即可避免。</p>

<h3>鴻基煤巳配售　白煤市況仍堅</h3>
<p>煤市鴻基白煤業己由煤商業聯合營業處配售與各同業而市上陽泉焦作白煤塊市價，仍然堅俏，（綠此次配售數量，雖有七百餘噸，而全市同業亦有八九百單位，故平均數量極微，本市冬季需用白煤頗廣，目前來源仍無望，故人心甚爲濃厚），白煤屑承前趨勢，行情續見挺秀，烟煤塊因聯營處限制同業申購，市價又升，僅烟煤　較爲平穩。</p>
<h3>米價止跌轉堅　油糧繼續下降</h3>
<p>米市連日步跌之後，產地划申不合，早市人心趨堅，喚起一二千元，惟閘北河下存積豐厚，有米船二百餘艘，客貨登記一萬四千餘石，店胃不暢，收市仍轉平淡，結果粳米元米彷彿，秈米略挺，油市以靑島生油到源接連，漢口大連亦有少數到申，生油續疲千元，豆油帶軟，菜油平正，豆餅油頭略取，價格平平，黃豆各地銷路不動，東北尙有來源，本市電化淸懈，隴海綫亦可到貨，形成供過於求，同跌三五百至千元不一，彔豆各路來源接續，高貨交易不多，中次並無受主，回小一二千元，尙乏成交，紅糧亦疲三五百元，莞豆胃呆下挫千元，蠶豆去化减，　小千元，生仁暫無上落，花生下等貨亦小五六千元，芝蔴再低三五百元，黑蔴猛烈狂跌萬元，麩皮貨缺獨挺，赤豆新貨初見。</p>
<h3>白金跌價　每盎斯七十五元</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約十一日電〕紐約白金頃已由前此八五元與八八元間之價格，减至每盎斯八五元與七五元之間。此查種疲弱現象之重現，實應歸咎於投機人方面以每盎斯七五元之價格拋售所致，在此價格下究售出多少迄未獲得證實，其他方面雖仍扳持八五元之價格，惟目下新交易仍少做開。又悉珠　業目下擁有之貨色，遠較前此佔計者爲大云。</p>
<h3>呢羬走銷大盛</h3>
<p>日來呢羢行銷之盛，眞係出人意外，如細毛花呢嗶嘰海林棒，直貢，色子貢，宣維呢，華達呢大衣呢，平厚呢等，市價雖貴，逐日實地成交仍夥，因憾於市貨流通之缺乏，對於定貨心思遂更濃厚，不關英貨，美貨香港轉口貨，無論近　期均欲訂定，蓋欲應合時市，兼照今之國內外市價推銷，無一批不賺錢也，行商因接定湧盛，致定洋已由三五成减至二成，定價亦遠較二三個月前爲合理云。</p>
<h3>商情摘要</h3>
<p>桂圓　同安桂同昨據產電，又升一萬元，申市日前已升二三萬元，當能合算。</p>
<p>綫粉　近以到貨不多，開價較緊，復升二萬元之譜，上牌龍口粉爲三七八萬元，靑島粉三十六萬元。</p>
<p>錫箔　成交稀少，上海存貨須補徵貨物稅，故皆赴產地紹興採辦，自十月一日起，由產地出口者均有稅單，至申時，凡執有該稅單者，毋須補稅，因之紹市熱鬧，而申市趨靜。</p>
<p>五金　鐵器漲風方興未艾，元丁市價每桶又見好起一萬餘元，木羅絲經客帮大量採辦，繼續上升，新貨羊干漆存底不豐，更經多方搜羅，形成奇缺。</p>
<h3>香港英貨　壓倒美貨</h3>
<p>〔香港訊〕運來美國貨來港日漸減少，且有繼續這減之勢，最近美金下跌，是其證明之一，據某美國辦莊負責人談，美國貨可能減少來港之主要原因：（一）爲美國貨來港路綫過長，成本比較高昂。（二）美電官價難買，黑市價高，故香港市塲之英國貨，已漸漸壓倒美貨，良以所有美國有到之貨物，英國，澳洲及印度均有貨來，而成本較美國貨底，例如花布一樣，從印度來之花布，每碼僅一元五毫之成本，但以美國來者，則須二元五毫，印度布沽二元已有錢可賺，但獎貨則要虧本，澳洲來港之罐頭，近來亦已壓倒美貨，因此美貨少來，而美滙美鈔之需要遂減少，需要減少，市價遂不能不跌云。</p>

<h3>獨劍攻心</h3>
<p>— 淮陰收復記　三日淮陰快訊　本報特派員杭舟</p>
<p>記者到淮陰的當晚，住在七十四　副官處。魏振鉞參謀長聽說記者到了，非常高興，深夜　見我，津津有味地述說淮陰收復的經過。第二天一早，記者會見張靈甫師長，高大的個子，兩眼奕奕有神，頭髮稍帶點灣曲，做個美國人。他談起戰鬥的情形時，令記者響往於槍花彈雨之中。</p>
<p>我遇見的七十四師的每一個兵，都給我一個生氣蓬勃的印象。從王耀武將軍時代起，這個部隊有着一貫的作風，就是紀律嚴明，管士兵如同子弟。因此，作起戰來，每一個士兵都願意爲作戰的目的，爲長官去效死，勇往直前，毫無反顧。由於紀律嚴明，談收復區的民衆在　憶起共軍的暴行時，親熱地感覺到：「這才是眞正來解放我們的人！」</p>
<p>七十四師是經過整編的師，一共有三個旅：五一，五七，五八，人稱「三五牌」。又有人根據這三個旅的特點給它們作如下的形容：五一旅如鐵之强硬，五七旅似火般熾烈，五八若獅樣猛勇，合起來爲「鐵火獅」。—够響亮的三個字！這次收復淮陰之職，是五八，五一旅主攻，五七旅担任掩護。</p>
<p>單刀直入</p>
<p>關於這一戰役的經過，是帶着幾分傳奇的意味的。</p>
<p>七月下旬，廣西將領鍾紀統率的第七軍（尙未整編），自安徽固鎭出發，一口氣攻克靈璧，泗縣，五河三個城市，打開了蘇北的大門，可以說是淮陰戰役的前奏。繼之，該軍向東直指，於九月十四日收復泗陽，並立即渡運河，老黃河攻衆興集。共軍在泗淮公路上佈置好重兵，準備展開大戰，却料不到奇兵突然在它的左側出現。</p>
<p>這一支奇兵便是七十四師，於攻克宿遷後，隨第七軍跟進，向以情報靈通的共軍不曾發覺。待第七軍渡河成功後，七十四師突以驚人的速度，如午夜流星，自泗陽東南方，沿泗淮舊這直撲淮陰。共軍接獲情報時，已經在正理上起了恐慌。</p>
<p>七十四師使用的這一戰術，便是有名的「獨劍攻心」，或稱爲「單刀直入」。徐州綏靖主任薛岳於召見張靈甫時說：「這一戰術，爲我第一次使用。你們可能遭受包圍。任務雖然是艱鉅的，但成功則是加倍的」。七十四師這把鋒利的「劍」畢竟獲得了那顆「心」。</p>
<p>共產黨爲它軍事的失利，預先下過註解，說是在情勢不利時可以放棄城市，控制鄕村。但對於淮陰這樣一個作爲它們政治，軍事，經濟巾心的城市，新四軍軍長陳毅下過死守令；蘇皖邊區政府主席李一氓表示過」要與淮陰共存亡」。因此，它抽調在這一地區的兵力是蘇北的主力。據估計爲第二師，第四師，第六師，第五縱隊，第九縱隊及從中原突圍的一個旅，總共有廿餘團，三四萬人。</p>
<p>排除萬難</p>
<p>國軍在蘇北戰塲上被迫的還擊，頗感苦悶，原因是共軍和它們所祟拜的明末流寇李自成一樣是到處流竄的，主力很難找到。這一下碰上了，碰得正好！在過去，共軍使用主力作戰，他有泰興一仗，現在是第二次。　戰門於九月十四日開始，十六日進至激烈階段。首先激戰的地點在陳家集，該處有一道福引河。國軍敵前强渡克服了共軍的頑强抵抗。福引河一過，戰事便移到了淮陰的近郊。</p>
<p>十七，十八兩日是主力的主力決戰。十七日國軍有兩個突擊隊排除萬難衝入城內，一度傳說克複該城，即以此故。惟以後援不繼，旋即退出。十八日再接再厲，進展僅有一里路。共軍仗着人多，堅特不退。戰事在血與肉中膠持着。於是，我要說的傳奇性的故事演出了。</p>
<p>五八旅一七二團第二營營長楊勁，二等兵出身，在行伍中過了十六個年頭，一次次的戰功使他一次次的升級，最近升了營長，想有點特殊的表現。十八日晚間十點半鐘，戰事的高潮已過去。他心血來潮，集合了全營二百多個士兵，宣佈一個秘密的計劃。接着，全營排了隊，鑽隙向共軍陣地前淮進。他自己拿了衝鋒槍走在前面，士兵們好奇地跟着。每個人的心卜卜地跳躍。走得却極其自然。　走近共軍的步哨綫，睡眼惺忪的新四軍士兵問道：「那一部份的？」</p>
<p>「第四師，前方換防下來的」。楊勁隨便答出共軍的番號，黑階中看不淸面目，那哨兵只見到一連串黑影過去。　到了第二道哨位，哨兵照例問題：「口令」？</p>
<p>士兵們見第一道順利通過，胆子大了一半，就拉開嗓子喊；「他媽的，這樣囉嘛！老子打了一天的仗，不曾休息。什麼口令不口令」！　那哨兵軟了下去，心裏一陣疑惑，但不敢作聲。</p>
<p>接述過了第三道，第四道，……步哨綫。橫刺裏飛來幾顆子彈，射中了幾個士兵。受傷的沉住氣，咬緊牙，絕不還槍。—，一還槍，準誤事—他們勇敢地，機智地一共混過了七道步哨綫。眼前已是淮陰的南城。他們興奮得連心都要從口腔裏跳出來。</p>
<p>收復淮陰軍事指揮者張靈甫將軍（特派員杭舟寄）</p>
<p>勝利之火</p>
<p>時約淸晨四時許，天尙未明。他們迅速地佔領了靠城的一個據點，在那裏作了四十分鐘的工，準備進可以攻，退可以守。他們緊張地做着，共軍仍舊沒有發覺。一個共軍的連絡官糊裏糊塗的撞到他們的工事前被抓住了，詢問之下，明瞭了城內共軍的佈置，並知道城門口有二個彈　庫。楊勁這時接獲的命令是：「進城第一」！便命副營長率領一半士兵衝鋒，如果佔銷南城，放火爲號。</p>
<p>衝鋒的携着衝鋒槍，機關槍，小砲出發。守城的猝不及防，混戰一時，楊營的士兵衝進了城，立刻將彈藥庫佔領，即利用共軍的彈藥向城內四而八方一陣亂轟。共軍摸不淸來的有多少人，軍心爲之大亂。</p>
<p>火起來了—這是楊營士兵燃起的勝利火。跟着天亦亮了。城外各路國軍一齊總攻，相繼破城而入。在街道，在屋頂，在屋內，在各個角落展開猛烈的巷戰。共軍使用逐屋戰術，幾乎每一間房子，每一道牆辟都經過爭奪。十九日清晨起到午戎止，巷戰一天一夜，共軍遺屍遍地，終於不支而退。</p>
<p>日本投降後爲共軍侵佔了一年的淮陰城收複後，有兩件迷信的事：第一件，在十九日那天，李一氓公館後面王士成家裏的杏花樹開了花，杏花是春天開的，現在二度繼放，王士成說他活了七十幾年沒有見過。我特地去看了一次，還可見到殘花幾朶。無獨有偶，共黨作爲招待的葉園，現爲七十四師師部內，廿一日晚上多年沒有開放的曇花忽然像一個少女的微笑似地現了一現。這兩件事，刧後的淮陰居民，談着，引爲他們災難的結束與興兆。</p>
<p>夜奔一幕</p>
<p>這一戰，共軍企圖以主力挽救頹勢，結果是慘敗，主力被擊潰了大半。換句話說，它在蘇北作亂的木錢已經失去了四分之三，陳毅曾至城北的王營鎭指揮了兩天，自知大勢已去，最後偸偸地溜了。李一氓大喊「與城共存亡」，在十七日晚上，却演了一次「夜奔」。到霉的是那些替死鬼，陳毅惱羞之餘，槍斃了三個作戰不力的團長。</p>
<p>國軍論功行賞，楊勁由少校升了中校，全營官兵都升了一級。</p>
<p>淮陰敗軍向淮安和漣水潰退。它爲了阻擋國軍的追擊，竟施出了滅極人性的毒辣手段，決開了運河堤四處。水勢洶湧奔騰南瀉，二百里地區變成澤國。我到淮陰的時候，街道上還浸着水。我去巡視那被決的處所，每處都有五十米達長。但水除了使老百姓受更多的損害外，却擋不了爲救民於水火的國軍的前進。國軍一面設法堵口，一面繞道追擊，五十七旅於廿一日晚進入淮安，肅淸共軍，收復該城。</p>
<p>參加堵口復堤的工程，除了工兵外，還有當地的民衆。七十九歲高齡的王叔明氏熟習此道，被地方請了出來，指導督工。九月廿九日，四個口都堵上了。現在水在慢慢地退去，但共軍遺留下的仇恨，却沒有方法從人民的心中消逝！</p>
<h3>清張與收復</h3>
<p>— 九月十二日保定訊　本報特約記者楊炳森</p>
<p>河北省本月來突然顯出一新面目，即全省淸鄉工作之順利展開，月初首由冀東平東方面發動以來，旬日之間，已收穫顯著效果，但因此更加重了省政能力之擔負，冀省府及各單位，莫不全力探討有關開展之一切措施，同時伴隨收複區域之擴大，而產生了種種的因難，以是記者特將河北淸鄕工作之詳情及收復後之種種新措置，向讀者報道一下。</p>
<p>清鄉前的省政窘況我們這裏先看一看冀省當前財政的梗概，本年全省經費由中央核准者爲五十二億元，至六月底業已支出六十二億元，超出全年預定經費十億元，七月份中央撥借七億元，八月份撥借十二億元，九月份仍無着落。整個財政開源無路，節流無法，可謂已至山窮水盡，道是冀省整個財政的情形。再看一下與財政有密切關係的田賦征實，本年預期可能征收量爲八千四百萬斤，惟因小麥，在冀中冀南普遍患疸病，再加以水災，天災，人災故小麥產量，本年並不　當，截至目前止，的征收起六百餘萬斤，假如全省一百三十二縣，均能收複，估計可征收十一億斤，相差天壞。此兩項之最大原因，無疑乃全繫於治安關係，在此次未展開淸鄕工作前，全省僅收復四十二縣，不及全省縣份三分之一，其中尙無一完整縣，入縣城設治者祇有十四縣，故一切行政不能推行，財政當然無來源，一切行政支出，仍須辦理，以致整個省政陷於窘困境地，行政效率亦成「拖」之勢。</p>
<p>清鄉工作順利開展河北全省淸鄕工作開展以來，推行極順利，迄今先後收複冀東平東方面之樂亭，玉田，蘆龍，遵化，興隆，寳抵，三河，香河，薊縣，遷安，平谷等十一縣，冀中容城，冀南趙縣等二縣，同時保定地區，石家莊地區也繼冀北發動，治安圈日見擴大，爲時雖僅十餘日，省府行政已控制達六十縣，冀省政之發展，殊堪期待。</p>
<p>配合軍事開展之行政工作，省當局，處理亦極適當，軍政配合一體推進，各縣縣長，在一縣城收復後，立即樹立起縣政府招牌，實施安撫，組訓工作。甚至各縣的鄕保甲長，均爲事先派定，隨軍前進，至各該縣境，即負起村政的工作，同時各縣還鄕隊莫不興緻勃勃，拚命的來協助行政復員。冀省府民政廳長孫振邦氏，亦馳赴第一綫督導展開政治工作。</p>
<p>省府並爲顧及整個復員工作，並曾令飭全省各縣長即入縣境，協助難民還鄕，更舉行行政專員會議，研討有關復員期間之急要行政措施，並規定撥發一二等縣復員經費二百五十萬元，三等縣二百萬元。</p>
<p>首要工作救濟難民</p>
<p>首先透視一下，目前河北的災情與救濟工作，冀省本年罹水災者共二十五縣，災民百二十萬人，又流亡者二十六萬三千人，還鄉隊三萬五百五十八人，罹風，雹，旱災民十一萬二千人，失學靑年三萬三千人，失業者五萬七千四百人，一般赤貧二萬八千五百人，救濟分署調查者三十一萬三千人，新收復區域冀東十一縣，最低估計可能有十一萬新難民，再計算未收復之七十九縣約數七十九萬難民（冀省社會處統計數字）。從這個數字看出全省如均收復後，可增加難民九十萬人，故今年冬季，全省最低佔計可擁有各類各色難民二百八十餘萬嗷嗷待救。</p>
<p>再　一下實省當前的救濟工作情形本年中央撥省賑糧八千噸，賑款一千萬元，省方籌賬款三千萬元，其中以二千萬元，撥作收容難民及辦理　縣，昌黎等縣地震救濟之用，至於中央付予之糧因係接收敵僞倉庫之存有者，實際半數霉爛，半數可用，以上之　糧與賑款，截止目前已辦理之救濟工作計，賑濟人口爲二十六萬四千四百三十二人，其中包括被共軍鬥爭，流亡，還鄉，義勇壯丁隊，失學失業青年，及一般難民等目前僅餘雜糧六百噸，以此數來救濟二百八十餘萬難民，杯水車薪，相差極鉅。</p>
<p>收復後可能產生之難民九十萬之救濟工作，已成嚴重迫切之當前大問題，也即是淸鄕收複復之首要工作，故省方決定向中央各院部及四聯總處請求下列最低之救濟數字，計復興農村之緊急農貸二十八億八千萬元，普通農貸七十二億三千五百四十萬元，長期救濟賑款二百八十五億元，共三百零九億六千五百四十萬元，冀主席孫連仲並派省政府社會處長屈凌漢偕同各區難民代表四人於下月初赴京請願。　共黨控制區域內，誰都知道他們實行了鬥爭淸算的政策，民有土地有的被分配，有的被强迫出售，一且收復，小地之糾紛，乃必然產生的事件，省府爲　及於此特製定收復區土地處理要點，其內容爲（一）恢復原地主所有權，其使用權仍警　在耕種之人民，（二）壓迫出售之土地，其原地主得提證明請求行政機評定價額，收回其土地所有權，其使用權，仍暫歸現在耕種之人民，。自耕農之土地被非法分配或出售於恢復所有權外並儘先恢復其使用權，（四）行政當局規定所有土地及自耕農使用土地之最高最小額，（五）行政機關規定地租標準應在百分之三七，五以下。</p>
<p>此外省府並擬於最近成立各縣市處理土地問題之地政評議委員會而澈底整理誌，地　地地權工作，以全力來解決土地之料份事項。</p>
<h3>李天霞將軍風度</h3>
<p>在某一次宴會中，記者第一次晤見了第八十三師師長，也就是整編前第一百軍軍長李天霞將軍。</p>
<p>他嫻雅的辭令，謙虛的態度，和一種民主的，藝術的風度，留給記者一個深刻的印象。</p>
<p>師長是江蘇寶山縣人，說一口浦東話，稍爲帶一點北方的口音。個子不過高，但却足够表現出他富有年靑的朝氣和舊鬥的精神。同時，由於家鄕的濱海臨江，他更具有一顆熱烈而向由的心。</p>
<p>從師長的談吐中，我們知道，師長的才能和愛好，是多方面的　當我們每天到師部採訪戰訊的時候，時常可以聽到一陣幽靜的琴聲，隨風飄送，那便是師長在那兒作他靈魂的散步。聽說他最喜愛的一只歌是「眞善美」。據記者所知，師部樂隊配備之完善，人才之　富，實爲其他任何部隊所不及。他們之中不但有奏曲的，並且還有作曲的。記者過去所曾經聽到的「聖戰曲」和「勝利幻想曲」，就是他們爲紀念湘西大捷的結品。</p>
<p>過去師長常常寫劇本，近來，由於軍事倥偬，早已不彈此調。但他還是積極地提倡着。就該師政治部最近在泰縣軍民聯歡大會中所上演的「結婚進行曲」而論，不管在佈景，燈光及演技方面，都非完美，非常湛練。師長自已也說，像這次的演出，由於籌備的忽促，或許還不能算怎樣地精彩；可是我認爲就這樣子，在蘇北已是破天荒的舉動了。」此次公演，連續了有五天之久，師長每天必親自到塲至劇終方去。這種事實，是表示師長如何地愛好藝術，並且，又她如何地領導着人們向一個新的憧憬中追求着！</p>
<p>師長的天才，又有份發展到辭令方面去令每一個集合中，沒有師長的演說，總不會覺得太精彩：而某一個集會中一有了師長參加，人們的注意力，自然會集中到講合上去，聆聽着他滔滔不絕的無礙辯才。使會塲平添了無限的生氣。不但演說是這樣，師長在平常父際或談話上，對人的揹詞，總是那樣親熱，那樣坦率。就憑這點，他緊緊地把握住他部下幾萬人的心，爲國家也爲他去犧牲，去打勝仗。</p>
<p>他對於他部下的態度，完全民主，絲毫不搭起一個「師長」或「陸軍中將」的架子。他的工作完了，經常地自已駕一輛吉普車，四處巡視，察看他每一個部下的生活。師部裏有一處特設的中山俱樂部，這是八十三師每一個同志的靈魂休憇處，也是八十三師每一個同志的生命寄託處。在這裏，有一切高尙的娛樂。如電影，樂器，以及棋類，球類等。師長和士兵在這兒一全游戲着。他曾對士兵說：「娛樂的時候，我到了，你們不要起立或行禮。假如你們要表示歡迎我來參加的話，那麼，你們就鼓掌好了。」這是政治部的一位張同志，帶着一種興奮和驕傲的神氣吿訴我的。他並且說：「我們師長的美國作風，眞够味。」</p>
<p>師長是一個時代的軍人，他不斷地隨着時代的轉變而遇進着。他在閑的時間，看書閱報，也是他唯一的功課，即如最近京滬各報所披露的關於蘇北的報導文字，他幾乎每篇都必寓目。當傍晚時，泰縣城內中山路一帶的分局中，你或許可以看到他的足跡，他在玻璃櫉面前蹀　，找尋他精神上的食糧。因爲他記憶力特別的強，他看書看得很快。據說，有一次當他的太太詫異他一個晚上竟看去好幾本書的時候；他却不慌不忙，把書中的內容，有條不紊地摘要說出來。某天，師部軍法處某一位曾對記者們說笑過：「我們在師長面前，無論怎樣，是決不敢舞弊的因爲，在我們報告一個很冗長的數目字時，前後兩次稍一有誤，師長馬上就會給我們指出來。你想，還談到舞弊嗎？」師長對於經濟學很有研究，他常說：「世界上的一切，完全建築在數字上。」或者，正由於此點，造成了今日他優異的强記力。</p>
<p>他關注他的每一個部下，同時他也關注社會上的青年，學生。泰縣洧水橋小學復員之初，以校舍遭受偽軍破壞，不堪使用，遂發起一個游藝會，募款修理。這時，師畏除去精神方面，加以贊助外，還把他心愛的樂隊，參加演奏。更從其他方面予以側面的協助。</p>
<p>五六月間，泰縣小學教師，因待遇徵薄，不夠生活，紛紛罷敎。師長又聯合各界發動了尊師運動，作種種的擘劃，勞心勞力，始終以十分的毅力，和一片的熱誠，完成此事；使泰縣弦歌，不致因而中斷。</p>
<p>就是最近泰縣各界向省敎育麼爭設省中一事，師長也盡了很大的力量，向關係方面呼籲。　此外，如流亡靑年的集訓，師長也總是以一種悲天憫人的心，來辦理和贊助。</p>
<p>師長是王耀武將軍的舊屬。今年才只四十歲，在將領羣中，算是年靑的一位。正因爲年靑，他有膽量，有決心；在湘西，湘北歷决的會戰中，他顯露出一種新的精神出來，使敵人遭受了空前的打擊，而支持了整個戰局。戰事結束，統計軍事委員會頒發的武功狀，總數一〇七張中，他所率領的部隊獲得的有十四張，其中包括了最前的一張（第一號）和最後的一張（第一百〇七號）　勝利後，他率領一百軍的健兒，奉令渡江綏靖。他以敏捷的手腕，分散了偽軍的武力；更順利地完成了受降和遣俘的工作。方準備開始推進時，停戰令忽然頒布，未能如預定的計劃進行。事後，談到這件事，他總是帶着一種惋惜的情緒。他對於蘇北戰局始終認爲樂觀。他嘗作豪請說：「國軍並不是不打共產黨，是爲了要保持整個中華民族的元氣。假使要打的話，我敢說，一百軍可以在四小時之內淮駐　埝。」後來，事實終於證明了這句話的真確性。</p>
<p>七月間，共軍瘋狂地發動了蘇北攻勢。他們以爲國軍遵守政府一貫忍讓爲國的初衷而遲遲地不推進，是懦弱的表現。他們要試騐試騐一百軍究竟是怎樣的一支軍隊。泰興一役，吿訴了認爲武力第一的共產黨，湘江水畔，雪峯山　的輝煌戰果，決不是偶然的事。同時在另一面，更加強了泰縣人的售念：「有我們的李軍長和一百軍（到現在，泰縣人還是樣習慣地稱呼着。）我們是不怕的。」</p>
<p>由於戰略上的關係，八月中旬，傳來了八月中旬，傳來了八十三師將渡江南調的消息。泰縣各界紛電挽留無效，爲了留一點紀念，某日下午，各界假座大陸飯店舉行一個歡送會。餐前，師長向記者們談：「我覺得目前的局勢，比北伐時，抗戰時，尤爲複雜；因之，我們的責任，也就此北伐時，抗戰時還要來得重大，艱巨。此時此地，我認爲沒有一個人可以偷安，享樂，每個人都應該認淸他自巳的地位，負起他的責任來。」聚餐時，即席致詞，「本師移駐江北，於茲八月。其間荷承各界在各方面賜予大量的協助，本人於此謹致十二萬分的謝意。不過，慚愧得很，由於政府對共黨一再地容忍，我們格於命令，不能不大規模的推進，達到諸位的願望，這是一件引爲遺憾的事情。今當奉令南調，離別在即，感慨叢生，而我們可以共同感覺到的，就是—本師和泰縣各界人士的感情，將決不會因雲山修阻，而有所隔閡。我們還需要互相策勵，努力完成我們的任務。」談笑風生，開懷暢飲，直至夜闌方散。　似乎是天從人願，第二天的戰局，突吿緊張，八十三師奉令仍駐原防，應付突然轉變的局勢，於是便順便代泰縣人留下了李師長。可是，隔不了幾天，李師長終於在一片依依不捨的情緒中，離開泰縣，轉調泰興了。常然，我們相信，幾十里的路程，是冲淡不了彼此間熱烈的情感。一百二十萬的泰縣人，將永恒地惦念着他們的李軍長和一百軍。爲他和他們的成功而祝福。你看，來往於中山路上的人們，不是常會指點着那陳設在大同書局玻取櫉中的主席和師長合照的照片嗎？</p>
<p>師長初到泰縣，在各界歡迎大會上致詞說：我們極願意和各界合作，爲建國而努力；我們更願意接受「鄉先生」們的指敎和批評，使我們一百軍，永遠是一支時代的軍隊。」眞的，同情心和責任感的交流，八個月中，泰縣人與八十三師是打成一片了。</p>
<p>「天時不如地利，地利不如人和。」當此劃時代的轉變中，而臨着這支離破碎的蘇北，我們期待著李將軍進一步地發揮他優越的才能，連用這一支生龍活的部隊—三師，使光明重現於束整個蘇北。</p>

<h3>鄱陽湖畔的新秋</h3>
<p>— 九月十五日婺源訊　本報扔記者俞寗頗</p>
<p>郁達夫先生曾在十年前把富春江的景物，描寫得非凡標緻，當時曾經有人說他是有一種鄕土觀念在那裏作祟。現在筆者來寫道篇鄱陽湖的通訊，也會許有人作這樣的誤解罷？其實不然，不過筆者的故鄕，是處在鄱陽湖的上游，毘連浮梁·樂平·德興·同屬贛第五行政區，所以多少帶有鄱陽湖水性的氣息。　鄱陽湖爲我國五大湖沼之一，洞庭居長江的上游，太湖居長江的下游，鄱陽居長江的中游，出湖口滙流揚子，是昌江·信江·鄱江·集滙而成的，上自樂平·浮梁·鷹潭？下達吳城·南昌·星子·都昌·湖口·亘長三百餘里，濱湖各縣，大半是物產豐饒的純粹農村，各村的住民，除了少數經商以外，十九都是過着農夫的生活，天然的優越環境，給予他們以極肥沃的土地，使他們安樂地耕種自己的田土，湖水帶給他們安適悠閑的生活和波平如鏡靑靑原野的秋光，自然地襯托出一幅秀麗與雄偉組合而成的畫圖。鄱陽湖畔廣漠無垠的土地，都是大量的普植主要土產和雜糧，如德興的茶·稻·甘蔗·紙張·樂平的菜油·稻麥·蠶豆·黃豆·花生·靑靛·砂糖·蘿蔔·苧蔴·煤·浮梁的紅茶瓷器·鄱陽的菸葉·蓮子·米穀·雜種；瓜子。花生。萬年的稻穀·藍靛·都昌的稻穀·菸草。本年濱湖各縣早晚稻穀，都有十成的年歲，其他物產普吿豐收，民康物阜昇平時的樂歲，竟於今年達到他們的目的了，錦上添花，現在物價，仍然向上不能下落，以沼湖各縣全年農產的德值計算一下，物資威力之大，已足驚人了。</p>
<p>四大需要</p>
<p>湖濱農民，都是以勤儉耐勞而生活的。就是以血汗養活自己，是生產而不是消費，都市物質文明奢侈的風氣，，尙沒有傳入到農村，猶保持着日醇厚樸素的風度，他們的衣服，大半多是棉織品。因爲濱湖一帶盛產棉花，曾有人說過：這里棉花出產的地位，並不此煤油鋼鐵米得低，聽這句話，就可明白這里棉產的豐富了，所以濱湖農村的，婦女，差不多都紡棉花爲其主要的工作，家家都有着兩三張用竹片做成的獨輪手搖車，她們不息地自早到晚耐心的紡織着，用自己的棉花，做成紗，又由紗織成布，用不着到布舖裏買貴布來穿，衣的問題，他們已足够解決。食的問題，此衣還要來得充實，如家庭日用所需的米油麻豆粟麥酒菜糖烟猪牛羊肉，鷄鴨鵝蛋等，不但自己儘量的够喫，每年都有大宗剩餘的賣出，所需的只有食鹽是向外買進的，所以食的問題，更用不着去解决他，至於住，洋樓大厦，雖然是罕見，但土屋板房，竹籬茅舍，毫不缺少，有的戶次櫛比，有的疏落有致，建築的木村，因爲沿湖不產樹，多取給於德興。婺源。兩縣，近年各地的新建築，比戰前造得更起勁，不僅是聊蔽風雨了，行的方面，陸道有車載，水路有船行。人生四大需要衣食住行四個字，他們用不着去懷念，早已把他置諸腦後了。</p>
<p>晨曦霧罩，暮色蒼茫，湖邊的牛羊臥走，千百成羣，童農戲犢，曠樹低天，這是湖邊四時俱有的　景。月來花疎紅蓼，雁陣驚寒，月夜漁歌，凉風吹面，已顯出新秋的蕭瑟。湖畔農村的物產，多以這時爲總收穫，春華秋實，此正其時，我們試瞧瞧那銀湖波光，皓月千里，畫聽湖邊的打稻聲，夜聆湖風送來的漁光曲，和載着農村出產血汗物品幢幢來往的帆影。三百里寬廣的鄱陽湖呀！你深深地圍抱着這無數自力更生的樸素男兒，相親相愛，怎不令人羨煞？</p>

<h3>嶺南市政</h3>
<p>— 六日廣州航訊　特派員　梁風</p>
<p>最注意的。歐陽市長到任後第一砲，便是將街頭小販一律不准擺賣，雖然小販不能擺賣後生活無着是另一回事，但最低限度街道是乾净得多了！而又是爲了整飭市容，將所留本市的難民，都一律遣送到郊外，要他們還鄕去謀生活，免在此玷汚市容。這本來是「河內凶，移其民於河東，河東凶亦然。」的好方法。但目前農村破產，難民返鄕也不見得容易找到飯吃，所以一「河內河東者凶一的時候，這辦法便似乎行不通了。聽說有不少難民被遣送後又徒步潛回廣州來，大概他們都曉得，做乞丐也在城比較容易討飯吃吧！</p>
<p>現在居留未遣散的難民，大約近千之數。秋天還不十分嚴重，在中央社的疫情日誌裏，每日掩埋隊檢獲路斃的屍體不過十餘具；但秋天過後，難民們襤褸衣單，露宿街頭，饑寒交迫，而當局又無法救濟的話，那悽慘的景况，眞是不堪設想的。難民們早就發出呼籲，懇求當點設法加强救濟，而得到救濟常局的答復，却是「允予考慮」之　的官腔來搪塞，所以這幾天來，連緻發生了　餘的難民在請願，甚至憤然拆除了善救分署廣州區工作隊的招牌，一千多候船出國的僑民也在咆哮，大批失業的軍官同樣衣食無着，奔走呼號請求設法收容，這些事件也足够顯示社會不安的一斑了！</p>
<p>不過，廣州也有它的「繁榮」的一面。如果你走到長堤和漢民路一帶，那些「某某大酒家」的霓虹管會照耀到你頭暈目眩；酒家裏花枝招展的女侍，那種媚惑而慇懃的態度，會使你喪魂奪魄；不少達官貴人洋塲闊少，都在她們裙下俯首稱臣，一擲數十萬金，當不會吝惜的了；而西關某兩大酒家，那裏更有所謂歌姬侑酒，更是旖旎風光，不一而足。如果你在長堤西濠口一帶，也有不少「走私」的廣州小姐，三五成群的在街頭向你大拋媚眼，如果你有意的話，她們便會將你帶到她們的「基地」—酒店去，祇要你花一萬幾千元，便可銷魂眞個了；還有，東堤的一花艇」，也是別有天地的所在；廣州雖然是禁娼的，但有人統計：全市幹皮肉生涯的女人，總在二萬人以上，這大概又是一個社會問題了！</p>
<p>由於這種種社會不安的現象，新聞記者每每報導社會的新聞，便常常會涉及市政措施的問題，因此引起了市政當局對新聞記者的不滿。市府最初曾一度想統制新聞，並嚴禁各單位發表消息，這引起了全市記者的反感；致歐陽市長招待記者也沒有幾人出席，後來幾經解釋，始吿無事。但新聞記者們偏偏「不職抬舉」最近又不斷的對市政的弱點來報導或者批評，這倒使當局不能不示以顏色了！所以最近有一家日報和一家晚報，因爲同時轉載了一篇南京新民報的副刊文章，而被罰停刋一天，更有一家小型日報而被勒令停刊，據說因爲它刋登了一段揭發貪汚的新聞，而觸怒了當局，因而借了一個理由來要它停列的。　其實，這一切在市政當局，當然也有着許許多多的因難的；關於市政揹施的困難，歐陽市長在全省行政會議席上，已報吿得很透澈了，最重要的，當然還是經費的困難。他也曾從戰前的市政建設狀况，說到戰後的破壞的情形，最後一句也是因爲經費困難；他特別指出中央兩次補助復員費僅得五萬萬元，單用在修馬路一項都不够，其他常然更談不到了！所以巧婦實難爲無米之炊，雖然市府的稅收是月有增加，八月份是五萬萬多，而九月份已有六萬萬九千多萬，比較增加了一萬萬多，但道數月恐怕除了能够提高市府職員的待遇以外，要在其他建設，當亦無幾了！</p>

<h3>陰謀與陷害</h3>
<p>— 陶熊</p>
<p>看「清宮外史」演出</p>
<p>在渺小的人類中，存在着太多的陰謀和陷害：很多自私的人們，爲了一己的利益，不惜使用任何種不可赦免的手段去擺佈陰謀，陷害他人！「淸宮外史」中給我們充分地認識了這一點！李蓮英和李姐兒，這兩個無恥的人，在劇中代表着這兩個醜惡的名詞。</p>
<p>珍妃的被愛，引起了她自己的不幸。被李蓮英設計，買通戲子去謀害她，只爲了光緒帝沒有愛上李姐兒。</p>
<p>本來，地球在宇宙中只是滄海一粟，渺小的人在宇宙中能値多少！幾十年的生命，一瞬眼就過去了；爲什麽在這短短的生命過程中，還要做出這些不愉快的事呢？無數愚蠢的人，拼了自己的生命及其一切，去爭取他個人的享受，當他得到的時候，已經失去了他自己，或是他自己生命中最美的一段。他不能享受大自然中的眞善美和他本身最美最幸福的時光，却去追尋那些人爲的麻醉。</p>
<p>只有我們這些藝術工作者是被目爲儍子的。因爲我們願意生活在窮困裏，忍受着饑餓寒冷！我們不會陷害別人，也不會把自己的幸福去建築在別人的痛苦上！所以，我們只有忍受一切人爲的不幸！</p>
<p>假使世界上的人全像李蓮英和李姐兒那樣，這還成個什麽世界呢？</p>
<h3>人與鼠」故事</h3>
<p>— 胡天</p>
<p>夏知冰，應時傑和季若蘭三人是同學。夏知欲又深愛着他的表妹若蘭。但若蘭却和時傑結了婚。從此，知冰就在東北打　擊。時傑靠着會經營事業，成爲上海洋塲上的高等華人名流之類，若蘭以賢妻良母的姿態度着很美滿的生活。</p>
<p>一八一三」抗戰開始，知冰突然來到時傑家裏，他勸時傑爲抗戰捐獻他的財力，並且還勸他把在上海租界上的工廠遷移到內地去，充實大後方的生產力量，可是他沒有接受知冰的意見，並悄悄地到香港去度寓公生活。知冰對於時傑的懦怯和貪鄙，感到非常地失望，但他又結識了一班熱血的朋友，　是那些來請願的工人的代表們。</p>
<p>當年的十二月間，上海的國軍西撤，租界也就成了孤島，知冰和那些共過患難的工作同志們，蟄居在滬西區貧民窟阿發的家裏，繼續做着地下工作。</p>
<p>時傑和若蘭由香港回來，若蘭探到了知冰的地址，來到這陋室裏訪問他，當她看到知冰和他的朋友們的貧困生活，她就不了解是什麽力量在維繫着他們的精神。老張同着智識靑年小陸，爲了當大敵人要在南京路大遊行感覺到氣忿，他們倆在計議之下就悄悄地一人拿了一顆手榴彈走了。</p>
<p>時傑預備把工廠復工，阿發並不爲解決自己的失業問題就感到滿足，他想再勸時傑把廠，繞這香港內遷，這請求依然是被拒絕，又因爲封於抗戰的看法不同，以致阿發揭發了時傑用蔴包資敵的陰私，若　因此心裏很難受，因爲她也開始發覺了時傑的可鄙。</p>
<p>阿龍　來，他看見老張在南京路英華街口扔手榴彈炸敵人而殉國的一幕。大家在震悼老張小陸也回來了，他承認他因爲臨塲胆怯，才使老張英勇犧牲。大家以爲小陸年紀最輕，讀書不成，學劍不就，不如到後方去求學比較好，就由太家把最後的一點錢，湊給他去香港轉內地的路費。</p>
<p>米老鼠無　，是上海的暴發戶和新貴們的集合地點，這晚知冰也成了座上客，這裏也是時傑和若蘭常來的地方，所以知冰也遇見了他們。出賣了靈魂的工人阿梁，現在儼然以新貴姿態出現，知冰同阿發預定幹掉阿梁的時間快到了，但是又不能不數衍着若蘭的談話，舞塲到了要表演特別節目康加舞的時候，全塲的電燈忽然熄滅，槍聲也響了，在一陣紛擾中，若蘭看見阿發從容地退出了舞塲，知氷目送着阿發出去，才深深地舒了一口氣，密囑着若蘭不要聲張，從此着　完全了解了知永他們的工作，但是她也爲了時傑的胡作胡爲擔着心。時傑因爲同一個巨奸起了利害上的衝突，那巨奸揚言要不利於他，所以他想去香港暫避其鋒，但是那巨奸的迫害，並沒有放鬆了時傑，當時傑的車子剛一出大門，就死在亂槍之下。</p>
<p>太平洋事變爆發以後，意志不堅定的小陸，始終是徘徊在人鼠之間，終於在重利之下，他出賣了知氷。知氷與阿發是同時而異地被捕的，小陸也沒有逃出敵人的魔掌，給敵人所殘殺。同時又由着一張支票的綫索，在一個晚上，若　也被捕了。敵會想利用她來軟化知氷，並且給他們倆一個單獨談話的機會，知氷和若蘭知道他的技倆，因之也就利用這機會，談着他們自己的事情，由於往事的重提，若　揭破了知氷心底的秘密，這許多年來他所强自抑止着感情，在戀愛上一直是扮演着戲劇中的西哈諾，天亮了！他們倆迎着晨曦，踏着阿發的血跡，爲着要盡一個人的責任而犧性了生命。</p>
<h3>關於敢死警備隊</h3>
<p>一編劇有感　寇嘉弼</p>
<p>近幾天來，許多朋友要我寫一點關於「敢死警備隊」的文章，該片導演湯曉丹兄也要熱鬧一番，這麽一來，引起不少的回憶——</p>
<p>三十三年的七月，中國製片廠，用租借法案在美國弄來一大批材料，因爲國際交通的不便，在路上走了將近三年，如不即刻川掉，全部膠片即毀，當時曉丹兄拿來一片數百字的短文，槪不是大綱，又不能稱爲故事，只能說它是一段不完整的造意，要我把它編成一百多頁的一個完整的電影劇本。</p>
<p>寫電影劇本，並不像寫詩歌·小說·戲劇等那樣，因爲它不單楚純文學的，而且與現代科學有密切的關迎，必需熟悉機械和攝製的技術，寫出來的劇本，才能適用，我自己對於電影又是個外漢，實在不敢接受，經曉丹兄再三的勸告和鼓勵，勉强的作一次大胆的嘗試。</p>
<p>對於處理這個題材，感到莫大的困難，負責人指定，該片主題是要表揚戲中的主人翁，周夢禮是一個現代的新警察，其眞正的精神，是以服務爲目的，警察是民衆的保姆。但是民衆對於警察的印象，只曉得他們找麻煩，敲竹槓，欺負老百姓，是無惡不作的豺狼。如果這拍出來，觀衆都不進劇塲，只有放給自己看了。</p>
<p>當時國家在抗戰，社會在進步，制度在革新，就以新舊警察的區別，新警察服務的精神是什麽，舊警察的惡習是什麽？使民衆了解警察的職責是什麽，作爲該片的主題，朱嘗不可。</p>
<p>炎熱的暑天，坐在斗室裏，日夜的忙趕，在半個月裏，分幕的初稿算是完成了，經曉丹兄拿到中央警官學校和幾位　政專家去硏究的結果，是關於舊警察的劣點，不許暴露，以免引起糾紛來。但是，沒有秦檜的奸，怎能顯出岳飛的忠來！當時工作又不能脫手，精神上感到莫大的痛苦，可是竟有許多人，認爲這是升官發財的好階石，像一羣臭蒼蠅，扯出許多無謂的人事來。</p>
<p>凡是一部戲，必需有它的戲劇性，否則就不能成爲戲，「警魂歌」的主塲戲，是在一堪雄辯的會審中，即是全部的「高潮」，是我花了最多心血寫就的，是導演要拍的，也是演員要演的，更是觀衆要看的，正拍到這裏，膠片沒有了。</p>
<p>當時因爲國際交通的阻塞，膠片缺乏，廠方限定一部片子一萬八千尺，現在映出的前一段警官學校不是我寫的，是導演的介紹，因爲前面的舖叙太多，應響到後面膠片的不足，導演爲了工作的完成，把主塲戲删去了大半，把高潮轉移到後面，大破敵人間諜的全武行，這麽一來，淡漠了原來的主題，再加滿身的傷痕，而今問世還能能受到社會人士的稱讚，我眞是不敢掠美！</p>
<p>「警魂歌」是中央警官學校的校歌，是李敎育長士珍指定爲談片的題名，雖不恰到好處，却也符合，在重慶放映時，買座極佳，連滿二十八天，打破所有影片紀錄，這次在「滬光」放映，改名爲「敢死警備隊」，不知何人自作聽明，並未徵求作者同意，我不知渝滬兩地有什麼不同，如果爲了呌座，不如改爲「春宮性史」　好。</p>
<p>大家都曉得，一　電　　完成，不是個人的，需要多數人通力合作，警魂歌的完成，經過十五個月，在這悠長的時期中全體工作人員，受盡堅苦，忍飢挨餓，吃盡酸楚。而今天所有的廣告及大小海報的宣傳，除導演湯　丹用特號字刋出外，其餘均不列名，就連作者也在內，「中製」是國家文化機關，出品是爲推廣社會敎育，並不是要造一兩個人的特殊社會地位，大家在憤憤不平中去責間「中製」上海辦事處發行負責人彭介人後，才知發稿原出於導演本人，這種「一將成名萬骨枯」的個人風頭主義，頗令人失望。</p>
<h3>華德狄斯耐的新獻：人與卡通混合攝　之新片「南海艷遊」</h3>
<h3>本週新片批評</h3>
<p>— 馬博良</p>
<p>諜寳敢死團</p>
<p>一個舊故事通過了新形式，在極度緊張的Tempo下開展，有類似「上薩布蘭加」的小塲面，不同的是「諜報敢死團」比較沉重，它着重的是諜報人員的出生人死，兒女之情只是一條經綫，其整個的成績是川乎意料的優良。導演歐文潘茜爾手法簡　細膩，處處扣人心絃，潑刺有力，他的努力顯而易見，獨特的創造比比皆是。開首的小故事光就給人一種完全的意外，介紹各種新式武器和特工人員受訓程序，毫不多　或累贅，也可以說是幾點聽明的小噱頭，巴納電報室中被殺和愛倫一去無蹤的塲面，歐文潘茜爾巧妙地避免了正面的描寫，郤從側面加重了力量，在巴納向女電報生　情及馬丁拒絕繼續工作兩點，他的意思是和「直搗東京」一樣增添一點人情味，結尾一幕非常鮮明，悲壯有餘。也許可以說，歐文開始大大的進步了，一九四四年的「新生」他的手法平板紊亂，可是到了一九四五年，「邊城壯士」使他大受稱讚，較之「邊城壯士」，「諜報敢死團」情節數倍繁複，所以也就是說，是更成功的一張。</p>
<p>配音驚人，攝影淸新，剪接流暢，演員方面，亞倫賴德比「新生」出色多了，他和裘蘭婷菲芝琪拉有同樣可愛的演出，李　婷明澈如昔，她的眼睛依然望得那麽深遠，堅定。</p>
<p>沙漠情歌</p>
<p>一個浪漫蒂克的題名，內容是一個太浪漫蒂克的題材，我不喜歡這一種過份的誇張，也厭棄這種自大狂的美國英雄美人，「沙漠　歌」的故事如果不是像法國片「忠一義滅親」那樣有草原的獷悍，至少應該像「樂園思凡」那樣有美麗　的　夢，才不辜負了五彩煊染的平沙漫漠，爲甚麽一定要改成反納粹呢？爲甚麽不用高爾基「俄羅斯童話」中的「草原故事」的題村呢！我總記得雷門諾伐羅和美國當年銀幕情人羅拉蘭合演沙的「漠情歌」畫面的旖旎。導演不無可取，酒店艷舞的一塲和馬隊每决出擊的一幕，與那首阿拉伯戰歌應有同等的回味，但亦僅此而已。</p>
<p>新聊齋誌異</p>
<p>一束詭異的畫　展開來了，是一面殺氣騰騰的魔鏡，是一隻滑生了鬼魂的木偶，是一個古堡中的妖祟，是一個報兆的夢，陰森可怖，近似「紐約奇譚」，比較沒有順利的迎繫，但有單獨完整且美麗的故事，是在一個萎黃了的秋日的午後，幾杯茶帶出來的境界，每一個人秋燈夕坐的時候都會幻想到的驚駭，畫卷收攏來了，是一塲惡夢，但週末林木森森的道路郤又進入了夢中道路，它正是詭異神秘的畫卷的又一開始，下面的轉變的想像郤交給你了。</p>
<p>二　改名釋疑　湯曉丹</p>
<p>拙作「敢死警備隊』原名「警魂歌』。是在警報與不斷停電，而設備陳舊的大後方攝影塲裏，以一年的悠長時間完成的。其中全部工作人員曾在吃不飽餓不死的狀態下，束緊腰帶戮力從公。更因爲他們對藝事的忠誠，纔能使這部片子値得一看，今年元旦，本片在陪都唯一大戲院作首决獻映，賣座極佳，曾連映至一百二十餘塲，這算是我們在含辛茹苦中精神上的一點安慰。</p>
<p>抗戰勝利了，許多片子都紛紛還都，大家搶先恐後的在本市放映，「敢死警備隊」因爲完成在勝利之後，所以姗姗來遲。有了在渝賣座的成績，我們以爲本片根本就沒有改名的必要，因爲大多數還鄉的人，都知道這個片名，至少他們可以向自己的親友們作熱忱的推薦。但是事情偏偏出乎我們意料之外，除了文化界幾個朋友，其餘的市民並不曉得有這部片子，於是影院老闆們都主張把我們的片名改了，否則就無法呌座，於是我們被「海派」一的作風所屈服了！</p>
<p>「敢死警備隊」這個名字很通俗，是本市滬光大戲院史經理看片之後爲我們改的，他積數十年放電影的經騐，深深體會上海觀衆的心理，以這樣有把握的眼光，若說美國的影片是要根據Showman的意見，作爲製片的參考，那麼「警魂歌」的改爲「敢死警備隊』就是一個初次的考驗，反正美國片『異外的收穫』也要改成『鴛夢重溫』才能合上海觀衆的胃口，爲什麼我們的「警魂歌』也不能改爲『敢死警備隊』呢，祗怕片子不行，改一個新名字來騙人，那才傷陰德呢！</p>
<p>不出筆者所料，『敢死警備隊」以通俗的姿態在滬光上映以來，塲塲客滿，事後又在報章電影廣告欄中發現許多中國式的美國片名，如「碟報報敢死團」，「遊擊敢死隊」，都是以「敢死」二字爲號召。於是筆者更加懷疑，究竟戲院老　那麼喜歡「敢死」呢？抑還是親愛的觀衆們對於「敢死」特別感興趣？</p>
<p>不過我們這個並不是洋「敢死隊」，而是道地的國產「敢死　」罷了！</p>
<h3>轉移話劇陣地</h3>
<p>— 莫瑾</p>
<p>上海的話劇塲子只集中在舊法租界一帶，對於虹口，滬西，南市及其他區域，就是有了劇塲也沒有話劇團體肯到那些地方去上演。這些，在劇團本身當然有很多苦衷；譬如：那兒的劇塲不合乎演話劇；觀衆的數量少而影響到演川的塲數。同時也　響到營業的收入。我們站在劇團的立塲，當然希望他們能在觀衆多一點的區域里多多地演出，因爲這樣可以使劇團在營業上不致於有損失，使劇團的壽命長一點，也就是話劇的生命更持久一點！但是，站在觀衆的立塲，劇團應該爲了他們到他們環境附近去演出，使他們都能够欣賞到這　術水準較高的話劇，誘導他們走進劇塲。這些，也可以說是戲劇工作者的責任。再站在第三者的立塲說上　到底是一個大都市，五六百萬市民散居在土海每一個角落，那些離劇塲遠的觀衆，爲了時間和來　的車費，就只有忍痛犧牲他們對藝術的欣賞！假使專門要劇團排）個戲到虹口或是滬西和南市去演，我們不敢說營業一定有把握。但是把一個已經演出過的戲，再搬到那兒去演上十天八天，總該是兩全其美的辦法吧</p>
<p>「觀衆演出公司」雖然是新成立的劇團，但他們有一個偉大的目的，是　　工作者所　有的真摯的態慶！就是一切爲了觀眾！我們希望所有的劇團都有這樣宗旨；不欺騙觀衆，不欺騙藝術。更不欺騙自己！本　自己的藝術良心，把眞正的　　用　　的能慶介紹給觀衆！在這一點，不成問題的「觀　　　出公司」是已經做到了。因爲參加一觀衆演出公司」的藝術工作者們在大後方和上海的幾次演出態度里，已經爲人們所公認了！</p>
<p>爲了這樣，我們只能希望「觀衆演出公司」發起和領導這一個掘發工作：在每决演出一個戲之後，能再度據到其他的區域去上演。使那此沒有機會欣賞藝術的觀衆，也能看到這完整而又嚴肅的戲劇　術！</p>
<p>我們希望一觀衆演出公司」就從「淸宮外史」開始！搬進其他區域的劇塲里去上演，看看那些區域里的營業狀况，及其觀衆的數量！</p>

<h3>幸福島</h3>
<p>— 范泉</p>
<p>（一）金山</p>
<p>我生長在金山縣的呂巷鎭，然而在金山縣裏却找不到一個可以遊覽的山。小時候我常常幻想着：山是怎樣一種崇高的怪物呢？也許山的尖頂可以直逹到天上，因爲天上有雲，而山的尖頂上佈滿了雲。從雲，我又連想到騰雲駕霧的仙人的故事。我從街頭流行的連環畫上，看到了許多在雲堆裏走路的仙人，他們不費絲毫的氣力，可以坐在雲上，一霎眼到了上海，再一霎限可以飛到美國去。我想，要是金山縣裏有了山，那是多麼可以値得我自己的驕傲呢？我也許不辭艱辛，用我全身的氣力，從山脚一直爬到山頂。於是我在山頂上捉住了雲，讓自己的脚踏上去，站立在潔白的雲朶上。然後我吹一口氣，把雲朶從山頂上推開，不知所云地飄，飄，一直飄到我心裏想念的美麗的地方去。我想，人類又何必發明飛機呢？飛機只能搭有限數量的人，而山——那走到雲船裏去的山，却可以走無數的人，而那雲朶的廣大也是一望無垠的，它可以載全世界的人類，不分種族，更不分貴賤，無拘束的飄，飄，一直飄到人類所要願意去的地方。</p>
<p>如果人類有一個理想的幸福島，那雲是可以隨着你的意志，飄到那幸福島裏去，不限人數，更不限等級，——他是一位普渡衆生的救世主。</p>
<p>我多麽渴念着能够有一座金光燦爛的巍峨的山啊！</p>
<p>（二）碧海</p>
<p>十四歲的時候我離別了母親，孤另另地，來到朱涇鎭的金山縣中裏唸書。那時候我常常懷念着家。因爲懷念，一種憂鬱的感覺直剌到我底心頭。我從憂　而變得孤獨，常常一個人靜悄悄地躑躅在那塊操塲的草地上。於是一次又一次，我用手臂做了枕頭，仰天躺臥在空曠的原野裏。傍晚的原野顯得那麼靜謐，兩三隻烏鴉打碧色的天空裏劃過，凄然地一聲長鳴，更增添了原野的無限寂寥。可是我愛那樣的空曠和寂寥，我自在地躺臥着，仰眼眺望着遙遠的天際，使我惑染到無窮盡的人生的熱意。是的，我舉眼看到美麗的雲霧，我便連想到人生的美麗和灼熱的企岡。</p>
<p>我把我的眼睛睜大，圓圓的，穿過了萬里的長空，我看到了碧色的天。晚霞帶玫瑰的紅彩，星羅棋佈似的躱在碧空的處處。碧色的太空就好像是一片汪洋的海，而玫瑰色的晚霞就好像是散處在碧色海洋裏的島國。「海」，我在自己的心裏說着，「海應當有着怎樣廣闊的距離呢？我不能用尺來量，我不能用眼來看，但海，它是一邊接連了天涯，一邊接連了地角，它也許是一張無邊無底的太極圖啊！」</p>
<p>我呆呆地眺望着天海，眺望着彩紅的晚霞，我就好像置身於大海之中。我看見了海水裏的各種奇怪的動物，我聽到了海潮的澎湃，海鷗的吶喊，但那好像是集合了起來，成爲一種音樂的節奏。我的寂寞的心便開始激奮起來了，我覺得我是那麼愉快地在海裏跋涉，我披波拒浪，用盡我全身的氣力，在海的碧波上勇猛地前進。我這樣地在碧色的大海裏到底爲了什麼而忙碌呢？到底在那空嚝的波濤裏摸索着什麽呢？</p>
<p>「找尋幸福島！」。</p>
<p>我這樣回答。</p>
<p>音樂的節奏引領着我，我不辭艱辛，跋涉着。惟有在這樣的跋涉裏，我並不感到內心的寂寞。我好像萬千個人都跟隨了我，他們熱烈地慫恿我，指導我，訴說着走向幸福島的路途。「是的，幸福島，那不是一個人的幸福，那是萬千個人的幸福島！，那是全人類的幸福島！」我終於猛然地醒悟了過來。</p>
<p>於是，我感到了無上的愉悅。</p>
<h3>夢裏的黑白</h3>
<p>— 宋夢芹</p>
<p>爲了夜夢裏的經騐，使我終日精神在恍惚中。</p>
<p>你是什麼意思呢？</p>
<p>當你匆匆的携來黑白兩襲披風，一定要我選受其一的時候，我眞茫然了。你舉起一件黑色的遞過我面前，我更加遲疑了。就在這意緒徬徨的一剎：你換過了那一襲白色的替我加在身上，却匆匆的又去了。</p>
<p>我直到現在，依然感覺不愉快。</p>
<p>昨大，我問你：一爲什麽你不等我決定了，遺下白色的就跑了？」你笑着說：「還是這樣孩子氣！不是夢嗎？也値得思索這樣久？我給你黑的你不去接受，自然給你白的了。」</p>
<p>朋友，你的回答多麽的輕鬆！然而也正見出你並沒有深思。朋友，我的思索，並非多所事。我不迷信，我並不追味那夢的本質。我任　　　　　　　失，我亦不致於向夢中去介意。我的不愉快，是爲了你不能在那授受的一頃，給我一個申明意見的功夫。</p>
<p>黑與白在色調中佔有着相反的地位，牠們給與人們的觀感亦自絕對不同。人們看到了黑，聽到了黑，意識到黑的時候，總有一種慘鬱，冰冷，陰濕，凄黯，僵硬，末路或死的最後的絕望的感覺。這却也並非時代的觀念，古已有之了。你看，文字的組介，凡屬背棄光明的含意，不都是從黑嗎？就像：「　」，「點」，「黯」，「　」，「驂」，「黨」，「微」，「　」，「讀」等字，都是很好的例子。這些不幸的字，在人們主觀意識下做了幾千年的陰慘卑鄙絕望的象徵。「白是快樂的顏色」那是從我才一讀書，政科書上就告訴我。牠的地位在人們的意象中是如何的崇高。因而「皇」，「皎」，「晳」，「皚」，「晶」，「皜」，「　唕」，「皦」，「　」，「噅」，「嚼」這些光明純潔偉大的字意都是從白。</p>
<p>人們是應該厭黑喜白，棄黑從白的。不錯，我從幼時就喜白，也許是母親在我出生後　歡給我白色的裝束的原故。因而我凡反乎白而近乎黑的東西，我都在厭棄着，身邊的一切，但能取白的，無不盡力取白。</p>
<p>十幾年的與白相依的生活，是有些厭倦了嗎？爲什麽人的思想是那樣神秘！你還記得吧？五年前的一個秋晚的時候，好像我對你說過這樣一句話：「……我對黑色的失望，不及我對白色的担心更重些。」記得那時你說：「說你是孩子，你別動氣？……可是你的思想中却含有哲理…」什麽哲理，我並不曾注意，我只知道內心的意識是這樣的。當我看到白，聽到白，以及意識到白色時，直接立刻就會担心起來。從那時起，我一切避免接觸白。</p>
<p>朋友，你說我太多變呢？你說我的意志太不堅定嗎？你說我的人生修養太有欠缺嗎？這些我都承認的，而且早已以此引以爲疚——至少在你說話之前啊！可是情感是神秘的，我不但無法控制牠的襲來，並且我不自禁的已被牠捲去了。現在不自主的我是又在變了。最奇怪的是我會認爲這個改變是有着充足的理由來推動我。白色的喜愛好像沒有一絲的餘跡存留在我的神志中，並且我已感到替白色的担心，未免多事。我仔細的分析過，凡是章惹人們担心的事物，一槪有着牠內在的接受破壞的因素啊！對白色感覺担心，無非非是担心牠的易染。可是千千萬萬的顏色，那一樣又不是白色染成的？縱然白色牠是有意志的東西吧，秈能堅守其不染吧，可是久經日光塵埃的剝蝕，也要默默的輕籠上一層黃色了。人爲的可以避免，自然的力量却無法逃脫。白色呀！你們的最後能有幾許是純潔的？</p>
<p>就爲了這，近來有些朋友在嘲笑我是玻璃主義者。然而我的曲枉又是訴莫能及了。玻璃無非是無色透明的取意，看上去似乎超然得很。可是要知道，牠是襯上了什麽顏色，就是什麼顏色的。與其說無色透明的最中立，莫若說牠是騎牆；與其說牠是超然，　寗說牠是狡猾啊！</p>
<p>朋友，我變了，我承認我是變了。今日我才發現黑色的特點。黑，只有黑色最堅定，只有黑色最寬容只有黑色最澈底，只有黑色最永久。黑是偉大的，崇高的，然而又有誰懂得牠？是的，懂得，牠是黑；不懂得，牠亦自是黑；譏嘲牠，是黑；厭惡牠，牠也不過就是黑。惟其是被人們厭棄，才成功了牠的和平的操守；惟其是被人們認爲絕望的，才建立了牠獨立的色格。這些可是白色可能做到的？白與黑不過名以指實而已，若果必以白名爲純潔，爲偉大，似乎不妨名實調置的。然而這又決非黑色所介意。</p>
<p>朋友，你爲什麼誤解我，而且在夢裏。</p>
<h3>拓荒者</h3>
<p>— 尙莫宗</p>
<h3>期待</h3>
<p>— 聖潔</p>
<p>「期待」好似一隻向那茫茫無邊的對岸行駛的小船一樣，永遠飄泊在海洋中。</p>
<p>明知道這種期待是多餘的，還是把痛苦變爲愉快吧！痛苦不原是被過度的愉快所激成的嗎？把期待寄托在遼遠的幻想裏，也好似在長夜等待着光明一樣，用愉快的心情來期待吧！</p>
<p>一切的事都可以健忘，惟有期待是不能給任何的力量冲淡的，「期待」在人整個生命的每一個階段裏，都有着它那神秘的蹤跡。</p>
<p>在宇宙中，沒有一分一秒不是期待，不管是短促的還是永恒的。我們每天要接觸到許多人與事，這許多人與事，會影響我們產生了無數的期待；有時候，偶而看到別人發了一筆意外的財，你會羨慕他，甚至於當眞去模仿他，在你的心坎裏頓時起了最大的期待；有時候，你又碰到一個很漂亮的女人，她無意地向你廻眸凝睇，或者是一個無意的動作，你馬上被她的魔力所吸引，你的心靈給她誘惑了，心房會不住的跳動，腦際像觸電似地浮起了期待的雲幕。</p>
<p>在這廣闊的天地中，這一類的「期待」，像長江的水滔滔不絕整日整夜的流過，也可以說是一種神經過敏的刺激，但也不能不承認是一種的期待，只不過刹那間就會像流星似的溜過了，假使，你被這種期待所糾纏，那麽，感情傾刻的衝動，將變爲永久的期待；在短短歲月的人生旅途中，會給這些期待牽掛着，甚至於　入痛苦的深淵。可是，在那充滿了曙光的未來的一日，你會爲她的來臨而懷着無限奔放的熱情，期待着那麼理想的一天。詩意的夢跡消逝了你豪華的歲月，你走向荒蕪的原野中，徘徊在寒風刺骨的深夜裏，你會悵惘的靜靜地伸吐一氣，這口氣含有萬千悲酸的情緒，甚至於感覺說不出的難受。</p>
<p>人生是由各種玄妙的節拍所譜成的一支綜合的交響曲，在這曲子裏可以代表各種不同的心情，喜，怒，哀，樂……；而「期待」也正像一支美麗動人的歌曲，要是走近它去傾聽，它會給你的思索中增添了無數的煩惱，要是遠遠的默默地去欣賞，它會使你眷戀，也會給你浮起了那詩意的幻想，永遠地盤旋在你的渴慕中。</p>
<p>這歌曲是一種遼遠的希望，一種達觀的幻夢，失去的戀人會再回到自己　懷抱，遺失了心愛的東西會再度找到，死去的軀壳可以再生。人世間的一切是不能預測的，有時無限的痛苦，有時像排山倒海瘋狂的愉快。假便，「期待」到了眞正盡頭，這支美麗動人的歌曲，會放出洪亮的歌喉，盡情的歌頌，盡情的咆哮，彷彿無期徒刑的犯人在度日如年的地牢中，發現了光明與自由。</p>
<p>靑春的歲月像閃燦的星星一樣，如同夢似的飛馳過去了。在這悠長的歷程中，我的一個字一句話，一個動作，都消逝在期待中。因此，我最怕見「期待」兩個字，也討厭別人提起「期待」；然而，在另一方面矛盾的心理確又驅使着我喜歡它，離不開它，對多少數不淸的長夜裏，我曾以迢遙的遐想去「期待」；在那時，情感是不能控制的，只要有一些微風與細雨的掀動，敏感的馬上認爲是期待來臨的前奏曲，漸漸的激動了固封在心底的熱情，像瀑布似的奔放出來，這一支前奏曲，將會震驚整個的天地，像火山崩裂震動了宇宙，而造成了生命上不可磨減的企望——「期待」。</p>
<p>如果第三者站在另一個世界裏，向每一個期待的人們靜靜的觀察，他會覺得期待太可貴了。它有着不可估計的力量，神秘的搬弄着宇宙中的人羣，它究竟是人們光明的引導者呢？還是它用用誘惑的魅力來支配人羣呢？它像是久經沙塲的英雄，永遠環繞着生活的圈子，戰聞着，把那些珍貴的光陰與純潔摯誠的鍾情，變成了海洋上的一葉扁舟，任憑海風的吹拂，巨浪掀天，隨時有被打沉在海低的危險；如果，萬一僥倖的生還，將還是度着那飄泊的生涯，面對無盡頭的對岸航行，永恒的永恒的，强作歡笑地期待着，這種漫長的期待，使聰敏的人羣又多抹上一層痛苦的惆悵！</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　　61</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「老伯…！」一個尖嫩的童音。</p>
<p>「岳先生…！」一個淸脆的喉矓。</p>
<p>這是怎麼說？我費了這多事，冒着砲火趕到這裏來，豈不是爲了他們這兩個人失了踪嗎？怎麼等我趕了來，他們却好端端地站這裏，好像沒事一大堆？</p>
<p>「他們兩位也只剛剛回來，不到十分鐘功夫」那位行動司令微微笑着，「木來正休息着，聽說您來了，要求我不要說出來，……」</p>
<p>「對不住，岳先生，」　羣格格地　着「要您勞駕，費事，煩心，…這可也不能完全怪我們，可也實在沒法兒給這　通信，報告踪跡—從早晨到現在就沒閑着。」</p>
<p>她穿着一身一保安隊」的制服，武裝帶上掛着手槍，皮膚上似乎上過顏色，比前幾天見面的時候要蒼老　暗得多。頭　本來　的男裝；這們一裝扮，要是不說話，連我乍一看見，也　看不出是個玄予。而且她的聲帶頗寬，膛善也較普通女子重些，稍稍壓些嗓音，倒　像個小夥子。</p>
<p>小老虎也是同耀羣一色裝束，却是剃成一個光光的和尚頭，眼睛仍舊那麼又大又圓，圍着一圈長睫毛。本來站在耀羣身邊，見我一注目，好像有些害怕似的，把身子　在耀羣筏邊去了。</p>
<p>「那麽……」我剛張口說話。</p>
<p>「北平已經　隊長通知了，」耀羣已經猜着我要說什麼，「也請那　　了消息…本來打算請您不勞動，可是來不及…</p>
<p>「很好，」我點了點頭，「請休息去罷，回頭還想聽聽你們兩位的經過，究竟怎麽一同專……？」</p>
<p>精羣到底年青力壯，小老虎練過那麼深的武術，當然不覺疲乏，祇說「剛才已經吃過了，正要把經過的事報告一下。」我先還以爲他們兩人，最多也不過　到敵方，探了一　消息，要不就是跑到火綫上去趕了一陣熱鬧；誰不能料到他們竟是深入處穴，在敵人的魔窟中，眞可說鬧了了一個天翻地覆哩。</p>
<p>這裏，我把耀羣口述的經過，儘我所能記憶的，完全複述一回；下面的「我」，乃是耀羣本人：</p>
<p>那天早晨總隊長（即w君）把上通州的幾個要點—到什麽地方，見什麼人，幹什麽工作，—都說明白，臨動身又再三叮嚀，從車站起，就有敵方的許多特務活動；一舉一動，必須十分小心在意。又說，「我們幹事，雖然有功，不見優獎，而誤事失職，却執法極嚴。一切必須與常地本部指揮者合作，絕對不能越軌行動，除非有萬不得已，必須單獨行動之外，然也必須設法與本部聯絡。」</p>
<p>我們（即　　與虎城）到了車站，正六點七八分，因爲敵我在這一帶，常有小衝突，火車不能照行車表時刻開行，專指臨時掛牌通知。這天懸牌，說明七點正有一次車，我同虎弟便在站上候着買票。誰知候到七點只欠五分，還不見買票的動作。尤其奇怪的，除了幾個鄉下人外；竟看不見有人來候車。向站上人一打聽，原來這一向懸牌賣票的事，不大靠得住；甚至賣了票仍無車開，也是常有的事的事。普通人大旣都　小汽車，騎車，或步行。</p>

<h3>北站風景</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>秋高氣爽，人們有雅興作郊遊，我有個建議，請他去北站觀光一下。那個塲面將令有雅興者爲之爽然。仁懷者爲之惻然。</p>
<p>站台上的空隙地太少了，少到以致進出的乘客不得不在這些人牆中擠擦，或是在「人舖成的地」中捱過。「人牆」是排成的購票行列，我聽到一個脚夫的讚嘆，是形容它的長度的：「嗯！十六路哩！」「人地」完全是坐臥的形勢，有老到白髮蒼蒼鬍鬚盈尺者，有小到祗有三四個月的嬰兒，男男女女，甚至被褥枕套臥具齊全，水門汀變成了他們的旅館了。</p>
<p>這些人到底爲了什麼，我並未打聽，看模樣，並不一定是進備將北站當作收容所的，或是爲了等待購買車票罷；倘使我這估計是對的，那我不得不敬佩就在迢一塲景的對面那巍然高聳的大樓上的一些鐵路當局了。他們是沒有看見哩，還是看見了而無所謂哩！</p>
<h3>禁穿香港衫</h3>
<p>— 甘來</p>
<p>上海夏令流行的「香港衫」，本來應該稱做「夏威夷衫」，因爲這種衣服，係該羣島土人所始創，它的優點是凉爽，便利，經濟，堪稱熱帶地方的標準夏季服裝。</p>
<p>這　夏裝，由夏威夷傳到香港，再從香港流傳至中國各地以訛傳訛，換上了「香港衫」的名稱。它的傳入上海，是在民國二十八年夏天，先由幾個海外歸國的華僑子弟穿起來，招搖過市，用的衣布，有紅有綠，五光十色，上海人初見這一種短袖關腰，非中非西的怪打扮，起先祇覺驚奇不置，仿製穿着的並不多，直到二十九年夏，「香港衫」方才在上海大露頭角，差不多每一個少年人，都置備一兩製，以後，一方面爲了戰禍拖延，物源日漸枯竭，商品價格頻升不已，尤以衣布爲最，這種香港衫用料不及一件西襯衫，而且可以省却外面的一件西上裝與打領結的麻煩，比起中式的短衫褲，用料更省，而美觀過之；另一方面，適逢夏令，上海人試穿這種新夏服，果然覺得混身輕鬆，非常舒適，因此，「香港衫」便在上海風行一時，到了今日，專營香港衫的廠　店舖，不下二三百家之多，暑天一到，試望街道行人，十有八九是衣「香港衫」的。</p>
<p>廣東省接近熱帶，夏令時節，炎熱過於上海，穿「香港衫」的一定更多。但是最近廣東省政府，忽然下令所屬機關，轉誡職員在辦公時間內，一律不准穿着「夏威夷衫」，認爲這種服裝，有礙觀瞻，喪失體統。據說上月十九日，省政府某屬局的一個股長，一時忘記了禁令，竟穿香港衫直入省府主席羅卓英的私邱謁見，第二日，便由羅氏條諭撤職。看了這一則新聞，發生下面的感想：</p>
<p>香港衫有其不可抹殺的優點：經濟，便利，凉爽。廣東省政府指爲有礙觀瞻，喪失體統，雖然不是毫無根據，但仍失於苛求太過。况且今日的公務員，如果是操守廉介的，能穿上一件整齊潔凈的香港衫已經不是容易的事，難道要他們一律穿起紡綢衣服，來「以壯觀瞻，以維體面」不成？恐怕就是　主席贊成，他們的薪水，他們的父母妻女都不會答應吧？</p>
<p>禁穿香港衫，我以爲應當做笑話看！</p>
<h3>佛門多事</h3>
<p>— 紅雨</p>
<p>自從市參議會裏提出關于廟宇問題一案以後，掀起了和尙請願的軒然大波。那裏知道大波未平，而佛門之內的小波，却逐逐而起。海上最著名的靜安寺，就有德悟密迦二僧爲了漢奸嫌疑而被押于法院。跟着的是西竺寺廟產，由原主止方因密迦被捕，而慨然捐贈爲中國佛敎醫院。還有羅漢寺的住持，因爲圓寂以後，他的姘婦，另招了一個和尚到該寺權充主人，詎該寺徒衆不服，堅決反對。這件桃色糾紛案，至今還沒有解決。最近萬壽庵裏，又在鬧着樓上寄居的「武則天」販毒，（武則大，係江北婦人陳姜氏混名）。當家和尚濟源，却是個吸毒犯，而又是武則天的寄爺。這樣氤氤糾縵的佛門醜事，毋怪某處長在參議會裏，要直言談相的揚穿他們淸凈而實未淸淨的黑幕了。雖然當時聲勢洶湧，衆光頭要告他誣衊之罪，可是現在事實擺在面前，還有何說。唔！「佛國有緣，佛法相因」。難道就作這麼解釋嗎？罪過！罪過！</p>
<h3>地圖</h3>
<p>— 儲品文</p>
<p>讀六日本欄渭然先生的麻本，令人生無限的感慨，在我們中國這類情形的確相當的多，前幾天筆者也碰到一件類似的事，大約是三日的一個傍晚吧，筆者在街上閒逛，偶見一本初中用的會語書，他的名字呌「日用英語會話」，是伊文思出版的，由於好奇心的驅使，駐足翻閱了一遍，在封底上發現了一張駭人的商標，原來這商標似乎是我國的地形圖，然而在這黑色的地形岡裏只有華中華南諸省（因爲只是一個黑影，不辨究竟包括幾省），但是可以明白的辨出，新疆沒有，西藏沒有，東北更沒有，見之實令人毛骨悚然，這種荒謬的情形，或許在租界時代及昏庸的敵僞時代可能發生，前者因爲帝國主義者早把邊陲諸省不算我國的領土了，後者根本悉聽日寇指揮的，可是一看封底裏面，却明明白白的印着「中華民國三十五年五月出版，眞不知道怎麼會許他出版，大量的出售，更不知道是不是大國民風度而「不拘小節一的緣故？</p>
<h3>電報稿自述</h3>
<p>— 勁艸</p>
<p>我出生的那天，報務員在我的頭上寫了（十萬火急）四字。這是我引爲最光榮的事，譯電員將我的身份抄在一張來電紙上，並在我的頭頂劃了三個（十）字　三個圈圈後交給科員；那位科員却簽了一個日期和　上個私章，似乎毫不關心地，可是我心內是多麽的然急啊！走進科長室足足等了五小時，我頭上的三個「十」字壓得我一身冷汗。科長輕易地寫上一呈核」二字，又送到處長公館裏，處長不在家，太太把我收下來，向抽屜內一塞，從下午挨到次日中午，不是娘姨整理抽屜，我的終身也就此壽終正寢了。處長爲我被歧視而拍案頓足，將娘姨痛駡一頓，太太却一聲不響。處長在我的臉上狠狠地寫了「交×科長速辦」六個大字。科長提着筆托着頭抽完四枝捲烟才答復我而我未覺得滿意。處長連科長寫的是什麽也沒有看淸，就大揮「如擬」；再交×科員去擬稿，又是等了長長的時間，經科長的補充和修改後，處長用力地寫了一個又大又粗的「行」字，重回到譯電員手裏更換面目，到報務員將我的任務卸除時爲止，共計二又十四小時。</p>
<h3>人道主義</h3>

<p>某人食牛肉而不食蝦子醬油，羣問以故，答：「宰一牛，可食無數次，僅喪一命，一匙蝦子醬油，則喪無數生命矣，我人不能戒殺生，唯求謀少殺而已」，羣晒之。</p>

<h3>說長話短</h3>
<p>— ww</p>
<p>除了鐵面無情者外，世人多重視人情；小的說，問人家借半碗飯，要還一碗。他爲我惠了電車費，我得請客吃點心，我結婚時他送我十萬CRB，（即使在公布二百作一之日），現在他結婚，我也得照數十萬CNC。過去禮尚往來，人情之常；手頭萬不可吝，典當秋衣或絕食，亦必照辦；免得不近人情，給人家說一句刻薄</p>
<p>考我國婦女之名，取蘭菊芬芳珍珠華美者爲多，乃時代進展，一切新陳代　，也是天演定律；於是東施而取「美麗」者有之，「美」上加「美」「麗」上加「涎」者有之，甚且隱匿原名而取「莫娜」，「愛人」者有之，窮兇極惡，嘆爲觀止。更有自命爲超然派者，則「曼麗」，「莉莉」，「愛麗絲」大步歐美後塵。所以，爲父母者必須察其個性，妥爲題名；不然索性如售票員之直呼號數，來得爽氣，如海上某公，子女太多，不妨照編號辦法，佩上家徽，免得面熟陌生，貽人笑柄！</p>
<p>「天在上，地在下，良心擺在當中，　你一個銅子兒，是忘八」在千做萬做蝕本生意弗做的原則下，想不到生意人　有這麽一套斬釘截鐵的天經地義。</p>
<p>非生意人又何嘗不是如此？」咱奉民而來，爲民謀利，一不怕死，二不要錢，三—三民主義！」紅面赤耳幹嗎？聽他上任宣言，大有「鼎惠懇辭」之意，然而他掛冠論定，又是如何？玷辱三民主義的貪汚份子，我們要不要加以肅淸？</p>
<p>「雙十佳節，全市各公園免費開放，任人遊覽」。</p>
<p>「公」園而需要派司還是洋人留下的剝削政策；這回叨國慶日之光，庶民得以免費，眞要感謝先烈流血的功績。蕭規曹隨，在好的地方可行；公園是市政設施之一，豈可列爲稅源？且也公務人員憑着「梅花章」常常不「派司」，昻然而入，門警頷首擺手請進，這不是逃「稅」嗎？</p>
<p>李靑萍塗脂抹粉，描眉畫眼，正是藝術家的丰度，何足言怪？怪的倒是單上有名，却等她三天畫展結束後始予逮捕，何遲遲乃爾？</p>
<h3>歏觀止</h3>
<p>— 甘來</p>
<p>不久之前，在報上看到「黃色刋物」的廣告，淋漓盡致，有聲有色，可謂極「賞心悅目」的能事。</p>
<p>最近，廣州市有「秘書」一種，在書報攤上普遍也售，該書封而印有下面的一行字句：</p>
<p>「敬告讀者：十六歲以上，五十歲以下者，勿買此書！」</p>
<p>底下的四個字特別巨大。結果，讀者反而爭相購買，暢銷一時。</p>
<p>轉告上海的出版「商」和黃色刋物的老闆，你們大可以「依樣葫蘆」的來一次，旣可以省掉一筆鉅額廣告費，又避免了擬廣告稿時的絞腦汁，所得的效果，不見得有多少出入。何樂而不爲？</p>
<h3>談海寗潮</h3>
<p>— 羊仁</p>
<p>錢塘江潮，蔚然奇觀，但是潮汐天大有，何以只有陰曆八月十八出名呢？據民間傳說，其中自有緣故：因爲淸朝雍正皇帝殺兄自立之後，畢竟良心有虧，疑神疑鬼，非常不安，於是封乃兄爲「海潮王」做海潮之神，在海寗城內建「海神廟」以祠奉之，並定每年八月十八日爲祭享之期（或須　　　辰），大約欲以「香火萬年，血食四方」的意思，來聊慰幽靈，那時濱海居民，爲求海不鍚波，安居樂業起見，乃於祭神之日，羣趨神前，焚香禱祝，而游人商阪，亦乘興醫集，沿習旣久，遂成風俗，浸而至於現在「八月十八海寗觀潮」之轟動中外也，（核與海寗縣志海神廟建造年代相符，此一傳說，當非虛構。）</p>
<p>錢塘江裏沙的漲落，非常奇怪，有時不消數日，海面上突然漲起數十里面積的泥沙，「積沙成地」，歷百年而不塌，可以居民耕作；有時面積數十里的沙地，只要一見裂痕，也不消數日，可以全部嵐潰。</p>
<p>抗戰時期，海塘失修，傾圯日甚，海北七郡生靈的安全，也就失了確寅的保障，雖經當地官民竭力搶修，但完整的石塘，尚且擋不住怒潮的拙毀，僅僅一些泥土樹枝，何濟於事？正當危急之際，眞是「急」人天相，忽然在沿塘東西三十里一帶（自海寗東至新舊倉），接連着漲起了廣大的沙塊，這一地帶，是潮勢最猛的所在，經沙塊一擋，衝激之力，因而大减，於是殘破的石塘，以及臨時搶救的工程，居然能够一直數衍到了勝利。</p>
<p>據父老傳說：當洪楊亂時，海塘損壞不堪，也因沿塘漲沙，得未發生巨大災患。</p>
<p>誰料得到這冥頑的泥沙，却屢次有着保障民命的大功呢！</p>

<h3>Government Officials Wu Tiecheng and Others Discuss National Assembly Meeting Issues; Sun Ke Advocates Immediate Resumption of Peace Talks</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Wu Tiecheng, Wu Dingchang, Zhang Lisheng, Shao Lizi, Chen Lifu, Hong Lanyou, and others held a meeting at the Central Party Headquarters at 5:00 PM on the 12th to discuss issues related to the National Assembly meeting.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] After the official issuance of the order to convene the National Assembly as scheduled, the preparatory work of the National Assembly Preparatory Office will be completed within a limited time. Representatives from remote areas who are in Nanjing but have not yet registered are preparing to register within the specified period. Accommodation for the representatives is being urgently arranged, and the Overseas Chinese Reception Center is under repair and will be completed soon. All parties have indicated today that it is still difficult to discuss the issue of submitting candidate lists.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] Lei Zhen, Deputy Secretary-General of the National Political Council, told reporters that regarding the issue of councilors serving as National Assembly representatives, consultations were previously held with various parties, and it was proposed to increase the number of National Assembly representatives by 350, which would be allocated proportionally to each party, so that all councilors could participate. At that time, agreement was obtained from all parties, but a final decision was not made because the Political Consultative Conference Joint Committee was not convened.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Special Envoy Marshall and Ambassador Stuart have not issued any opinions after the National Army entered Zhangjiakou and the convening order for the National Assembly was issued.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The Special Envoy went to the US Embassy at noon on the 12th to meet with the Ambassador, and at noon, he and his wife picnicked at the foot of Zijin Mountain. Four</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Yesterday morning, reporters in Shanghai went to the private residence of Sun Zhesheng, President of the Legislative Yuan, to inquire about his views on the overall situation of peace. Mr. Sun said that the Central Government's recovery of Zhangjiakou should be a turning point for peace. Military action should be stopped immediately, political negotiations should be resumed, the government should be reorganized in accordance with the procedures of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions, and each party should submit a list of representatives to participate in the National Assembly. As for the convening of the National Assembly announced by the government, it is only a notification and reporting of a general nature, reporting that is not a meeting. Furthermore, there is still a month to work with, and all parties can continue to negotiate and jointly promote the realization of the overall situation of peace. It is hoped that the Chinese Communist Party can also consider reality and quickly participate in negotiations. According to reporters, representatives of social elites, the Youth Party, and the Democratic League stationed in Shanghai met with Mr. Sun yesterday morning to explain that before the government is reorganized, the parties cannot participate in the convocation of the National Assembly and that it is also impossible to discuss the reorganization of the government before military action is stopped. Mr. Sun expressed his agreement and willingness to convey this to the government, and he hoped that they would continue to work for peace and jointly reverse the deadlocked situation. It is reported that Mr. Sun is scheduled to go to Nanjing today to convey the views of the Third Force to the government in order to resume negotiations in a short period of time.</p>
<h3>Frequent Contacts Between Parties; The CCP's Attitude is Extremely Rigid</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Liang Shuming, Secretary-General of the Democratic League, arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on the morning of the 12th. After getting off the train, he went straight to Su Yi Village to visit Li Huang. It is said that Liang's trip to Shanghai was to urge Zhou Enlai to return to Beijing and to discuss compromise measures with representatives of the Political Consultative Conference. Before leaving Shanghai yesterday, it was rumored that he had obtained satisfactory results. This morning, after getting off the train, Liang learned that the government had issued a convening order for the National Assembly and immediately felt that this trip had been in vain, expressing great indignation. Li Huang of the Youth Party met with Minister Zhang Lisheng at his residence at 9:00 AM on the 12th. It is said that they discussed the issue of National Assembly representatives. Mr. Zhang stated that he welcomes the participation of all parties and that all issues can be discussed and resolved as much as possible during the period before the assembly convenes.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 12th] After arriving in Chongqing at the Te Garden at around 4:00 PM on the 11th, Zhang Lan, Chairman of the Democratic League, made a statement on national affairs to reporters from various newspapers, and the content was nothing more than peace and democracy. It is reported that Zhang will stay in Chongqing for a short time and then go to Beijing and Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Today, the political atmosphere in the capital is unstable, and some people are quite pessimistic. The Communist Party representative stated that the government's unilateral convening of the National Assembly has shown its determination to overturn the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference to the end, and that this will promote a complete break. They will not be bound by this and will never participate in the National Assembly. At the same time, the government should be held responsible for causing a long-term civil war. It was also said that the official instructions from Yan'an had not arrived as of 10:00 PM. Regarding the National Army's entry into Zhangjiakou, the spokesperson said that the Communist Party has not yet received reports of the war in Zhangjiakou. Assuming that it has been occupied by the National Army, it would be sufficient to show that the government has decided to expand the civil war, and the military and civilians in the Communist "Liberated Areas" will fight to the end with force.</p>
<h3>Cai Tingkai Arrives in Beijing; Will Visit the Chairman; Denies Organizing a New Party</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] General Cai Tingkai and his wife, Ms. Luo Xihuan, arrived in Beijing by special train from Shanghai at 1:35 PM on the 12th. A reporter from the Central News Agency made a special trip to his residence to interview him, and he said that he wished to visit the Chairman to pay his respects. He also stated that he has been in the military for more than 30 years and now, as a retired person, he entrusts his spirit to the country and the nation. The eight-year war of resistance caused heavy losses in manpower and material resources. The urgent task is to stabilize society, and all parties should be sincere and accommodating, and should not create more problems. The reporter then inquired about the reported organization of a party by Mr. Cai. The general replied, "I am a member of the Kuomintang. I hope for the success of democratic politics. I have formed a Democratic Promotion Association with a few friends to study the Three Principles of the People on how to achieve democratic association and assembly. However, outsiders are unaware and misreport, which is regrettable. He hopes that the army will be nationalized and that domestic problems should be resolved through political means. Individuals and parties must act with conscience and prioritize the country and the nation. After the war, the country's vitality has been exhausted, and it is urgent to gather wisdom and effort to build a strong country.</p>

<h3>Adjustment Method for Civil Servants' Salaries Will Change</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] It is said that the next salary adjustment for civil servants will adopt a new method, that is, in addition to a general increase in living allowances, the multiplier for wages will be divided into two levels: the lower the basic salary, the higher the multiplier; the higher the basic salary, the lower the multiplier, so that the income of high- and low-level personnel will not be too far apart. As for the detailed measures, they have not yet been decided as of now.</p>
<h3>United States Does Not Abandon Mediation; Special Envoy Marshall is Not Discouraged; U.S. Acting Secretary of State Acheson's Statement</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 11th] Acting Secretary of State Acheson told the press today that although the situation in China is serious, the United States will not abandon its efforts to mediate between the KMT and the Communists. The rumor that Special Envoy Marshall will soon return home to report on his duties is not true. Special Envoy Marshall is not discouraged about the future of peace in China.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] U.S. authorities firmly believe that U.S. mediation for peace in China is not intended to end. According to the current issue of "World Report" magazine, the United States intends to stay in China until peace and unification are completed. The future of China is bleak. If the civil war continues, Special Envoy Marshall may ultimately fail, but this is not enough to change U.S. policy. Stalin and some Americans advocate that U.S. troops should withdraw from China, but Washington has decided to ignore them. The rumor that the Soviet Union may intervene is also not credible. A Sovietized China is almost certainly the goal of the Soviet Union, but it is still far off.</p>
<h3>National Army Continues to Recover Huai'an; Fire Spreads Through Streets of Zhangyuan; Dong Qiwu Concurrently Serves as Temporary Garrison Commander</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 12th] Official sources claim that the National Army has continued to recover Huai'an, southwest of Zhangjiakou, but have not specified where the National Army came from. Yanggao, an important stronghold on the Ping-Sui Railway above Huai'an, has not been confirmed. There were only rumors that the National Army had recovered Yanggao a few days ago.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guisui, 12th] After the troops of the Twelfth War Zone entered Zhangyuan, Dong Qiwu is now concurrently serving as the temporary garrison commander of Zhangyuan. The situation in the city has stabilized. However, the prosperous streets of Shangxia Fort were set on fire by the Communist army on the morning of the 11th, and the fire spread for four or five li. The property of merchants and residents was reduced to ashes, and the station and water tower were completely destroyed. All the locomotives and cars were also burned. The two airfields outside the city were completely destroyed and cannot be repaired within three or two days.</p>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 12th] The command here announced that it has been three weeks since the National Army began its offensive against Zhangjiakou. It is rumored that the troops of Fu Zuoyi entered the city without a fight. Part of the army continued south to pursue the Taihang Mountains. It is heard that the Communist troops have retreated to Zhuolu, eighty li southwest of Zhangjiakou, and Yuxian, one hundred and eighty li to the south. Another part of the Fu army turned southeast along the Ping-Sui Railway, heading straight for Xuanhua, attempting to join up with the National Army moving north. After the recovery of Zhangjiakou, not only has the route from Peiping to Guisui been opened, but the connection between the Communist troops in Jehol and North China has been completely cut off. Military authorities said that the siege of Baoding could be lifted within a week.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Peiping, 12th] Chairman Feng Qinzai of Chahar Province is scheduled to fly to Zhangyuan on the 13th to inspect. When the Communist troops retreated from Zhangyuan City, they laid many landmines, which are currently being cleared by the National Army. According to people from Zhangjiakou, in the past seven weeks, 30,000 residents of Zhangyuan have been evacuated, including Communist Party cadres, border area government personnel, railway personnel, miners, students, and some farmers.</p>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 11th] The fall of Zhangjiakou is a major blow to the Communist troops in North China, because the CCP has stored a large amount of military equipment there. The U.S. Strategic Services Bureau learned a year ago that the CCP had stored 500,000 Japanese-style rifles and a large amount of ammunition in Zhangjiakou. The importance of Zhangyuan is at least equal to that of Yan'an, and its defenses are more solid than those of Yan'an.</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting Continues in the Huailai Area; More Than Half of He Long's Communist Troops Lost</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 12th] Fierce fighting continues in the Huailai area in the eastern section of the Ping-Sui Railway, and it is said that Xiahuayuan has been recovered by the National Army.</p>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 12th] According to sources close to General Chen Cheng, Chief of General Staff of the National Army, who is personally directing the military operations in Zhangyuan in Peiping, the Communist army's loss of Zhangjiakou was due to three major errors in defensive strategy: (1) The Communist army overestimated the strength of Huailai, the outer defensive line south of Zhangyuan. (2) The Communist army concentrated too many troops in Huailai, resulting in heavy losses when they encountered the better-equipped National Army. In theory, they should have dispersed their lines and taken more mobile actions. (3) Although the Communist army encountered General Fu Zuoyi's Twelfth War Zone troops, they clearly did not anticipate that Fu's troops would advance so quickly. According to military reports received here, the Zhangbei garrison was led by Nie Rongzhen, Commander-in-Chief of the Communist Army in Chahar Province, who also led the retreat from Zhangjiakou. About a month ago, Nie assured reporters that the Communist army would defend Zhangjiakou to the last man, just as they would not abandon Chengde. He said, "We will defend Zhangjiakou to the last man." However, when the Communist army encountered the powerful National Army, they retreated again without resistance. According to reporters, He Long, a veteran of the Communist army who was known for his resistance against Japan and who personally commanded the siege of Datong, was in charge of military operations in Huailai. According to the National Army, the Communist army suffered the most severe losses in the battle of Huailai, with three-quarters of the troops captured, killed, or missing. At the same time, He Long also lost the most heavy equipment in the battle of Huailai.</p>
<h3>County Governments Return to Cities in Recovered Areas of Jehol; Opening of Peiping-Chengde Railway Still Pending</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengde, 12th] The National Army has entered the counties of Chengde, Chaoyang, Fuxin, Jianping, Ningcheng, Pingquan, Lingyuan, Lingnan, Fengning, Luanping, and Longhua in Jehol Province, and the county governments have returned to the cities to work. However, security in remote rural areas has not yet been consolidated. Chairman Liu Duoji has decided to assist the people in organizing self-defense forces, and Li Shoulian of the Provincial Party Committee will be in charge of training. Also, after the National Army entered Koubei and Chengde, there were frequent reports that the Peiping-Chengde line would soon be open to traffic. However, the mountain roads between Chengde and Koubei are rugged, and the tunnels were blocked by the Communist army driving locomotives into them from both sides. Although the Jinzhou Railway Bureau has sent personnel to inspect, due to the severe shortage of rail sleepers, it is difficult to start work for the time being, and the opening of the Peiping-Chengde line cannot be realized in the short term. However, the Chengde-Koubei highway has been completed after rushed repairs. In addition, the railway repair work on the Pingquan-Chengde section is progressing extremely rapidly. It is expected that after completion next month, the Jinzhou-Chengde train will be able to travel directly.</p>

<h3>Li Dijun Arrives in Singapore, Reports Mission to Java to Reporters, Wishes to Visit All Regions Under Indonesian Control</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore, 11th] Special Envoy Li Dijun, dispatched to Java, arrived here this afternoon from Bangkok by plane. He held a press conference at the Chinese Consulate here, briefly explaining the mission to Java.

<h3>Insufficient Telephone Lines Between Nanjing and Shanghai, Telephone Bureau Actively Seeking Expansion</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 12th] Recently, it often takes a long time to connect telephone calls between Nanjing and Shanghai, and users have been critical.

Under the current simple equipment of lines and machinery, it is very difficult to keep every phone line clear. In order to cope with reality, in addition to important military and political regular calls, the phones of other general users should also be connected. However, because the lines are insufficient, they cannot be connected one by one according to the scheduled time.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>It Is Time to Replace the Battlefield with the Parliament</h3>
<p>Zhangjiakou was recovered by the National Army on the afternoon of the 11th; at the same time, the National Government issued an order yesterday notifying the representatives of the National Assembly to go to Nanjing to report to the National Assembly from November 2nd, so that the National Assembly can open as scheduled on November 12th. These two events have caused the situation in the past half month to take a sharp turn for the worse. Some people are anxious that the situation may worsen further, and even doubt that Zhou Enlai's threat of "complete breakdown" will become a reality. However, the CCP side, according to reports, is awaiting instructions from Yan'an, so how to react, the representatives in Nanjing and Shanghai are keeping silent. The government side said that the convocation of the National Assembly does not hinder peace talks, and the third-party figures who originally planned to go to Nanjing to mediate on the same day have temporarily postponed their departure. Judging from the current situation, it seems difficult to grasp the trend of future political developments.</p>
<p>However, no matter what the future political situation is, we dare to say that if China wants to achieve the goal of building a democratic constitutional government, there is only one main road: "replace the battlefield with the parliament." There is no shortcut other than this; even if there are some rugged paths, they are all detours that make people waste their energy in vain. Therefore, whether it is the ruling party, the opposition party, or the parties claiming to be the third party, whoever can thoroughly realize this point and immediately abandon the battle for supremacy on the battlefield and instead use the method of debate in the parliament, will win the respect of the people of the country and the sympathy of the world. A few days ago, we believed that if the Communist Party had a great politician, it would not miss this opportunity when the two envoys, Marshall and Stuart, put forward the final proposal, that is, a ten-day truce in Zhangjiakou, and at the same time, hold two types of meetings, three-person and five-person, to resolve all pending military and political issues. However, the Communist Party ultimately rejected it, so that even if the third party figures wanted to run around again, they felt it was too late, and they could not help but deeply regret it for the Communist Party. However, it is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. If the Communist Party really wants to be a decent opposition party (the second largest party) in China, then even though Zhangjiakou has been lost, the door to peace talks is still not closed. It still has the opportunity to immediately abandon the battlefield and enter the parliament.</p>
<p>If the Communist Party still wants to insist on its own way today, it must believe that the opportunity for a "complete breakdown" has matured and is unwilling to let go, not allowing the peace talks to be reopened. Then, guessing their intention, there are no more than two points: (1) Believing that even if the positional warfare is defeated, it may be better to change to guerrilla warfare, which can make China a situation of continuous war, waiting for future opportunities; (2) Believing that since Zhangjiakou has been captured, if they accept the government's demands and continue to discuss the reorganization of the government, participation in the National Assembly, and reorganization and unification, etc., it would be equivalent to a "treaty of surrender." In fact, all these ideas are unwise. In the former case, even if there is really continuous war, not to mention the harm to the country, what benefit will it bring to the Communist Party? Moreover, persisting in this way will only make the people of the country hate the Communist Party even more than in the past. In the latter case, the Communist Party representatives said a few days ago that they did not争 for the gain or loss of a city or a place, then the Communist Party does not need to be ashamed of the failure to defend Zhangjiakou, and there is no such thing as a treaty of surrender. Moreover, if both sides put the country and the nation first, then "brothers quarreling at home, but uniting to resist foreign enemies" and releasing suspicion and repairing relations is the performance of virtue. As for the great man being able to bend and stretch, it is even more difficult for ordinary people to learn. If the Communist Party can suddenly realize that military force is not reliable at this time and decide to change its plan to "replace the battlefield with the parliament," then the people of the country will all breathe a sigh of relief, and a peaceful atmosphere will immediately appear. The previous misunderstandings of the Communist Party can be swept away, and they will also feel that the Communist Party can correct its mistakes. What is the reason for the Communist Party not to do this?</p>
<p>At the same time, we want to strongly advise the government not to be content with the few victories it has won on the battlefield recently and forget the consistent policy of achieving peaceful unification through political solutions. We believe that the government will certainly not do so. Although the government has clearly announced the date for the National Assembly representatives to report, it does not mean that it will act arbitrarily and unilaterally. The government will certainly still abide by the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and earnestly hope that all parties and factions and social elites can participate in the National Assembly and jointly formulate the constitution. Even before the National Assembly is convened, as long as the Communist Party and other parties are willing to disclose the list, the government can immediately discuss the reorganization. From the government's position, the method of "replacing the battlefield with the parliament" can be said to be the most stable method of political struggle. Therefore, it is not enough to make people believe that the Communist Party insists that the government intends to "completely break down." However, we hope that the government, in order to gain more trust from the general public and all parties, may as well make a clear announcement again when Zhangjiakou is recovered, ordering the troops in various front-line areas to immediately suspend military operations for a certain period of time, in order to open the door wider for the resumption of political and military discussions. If this is done, the government's hard work in reluctantly launching a counterattack against the Communist army can be better understood by the world. Also, the Communist Party and other parties will have no reason to refuse to resume peace talks with the government.</p>
<p>In short, Zhangjiakou has been recovered, and the National Assembly has been convened on schedule. This is a major turning point for peace at the moment. The CCP cannot miss it, and the government must not let it go. And the third parties who are in the position of mediating and coordinating should especially seize the opportunity and do their best to make the "all-out war" on the battlefield become a "gathering of heroes" in the parliament! This is the happiness of the people and the blessing of the country!</p>

<h3>Suzhou Township Chiefs Flatter Bandits and Offer Favors, Provincial Order to Rectify in Order to Clear Out Bandits, End of Days Nears for Xue Yonghui's "New Fourth Army" Unit</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Office, 12th] The Suzhou Provincial Government believes that the area between the four districts of Suzhou County has become a base for the "New Fourth Army" Xue Yonghui's unit to harass. The reason why this potential force has been formed is mostly because the township chiefs in these areas flatter the bandits and offer favors, resulting in the bandits going away when the troops come, and the bandits returning when the troops leave. It is really impossible to completely eliminate them. The recent case of Lu Zhongying, the chief of Tong'anqiao Township in the fourth district of the county, being arrested by the First Pacification District for aiding the bandits, with conclusive evidence of guilt, shows that the judgment is not false. Now, in order to thoroughly eliminate the bandit scourge, it is necessary to evaluate the township chiefs in the area and adjust them. This cannot be achieved without success. Yesterday, a special telegram was sent to the Suzhou County Government, strictly ordering it to comply and immediately begin reviewing the qualifications and learning of the township chiefs, and make adjustments immediately, strictly prohibiting connivance, so as to establish a sound political foundation.</p>
<h3>Should Township and Village Chiefs Serve in the Military? Ministry of National Defense Clarifies Doubts; Suzhou Garrison District Convenes Military Service Conference of Three Counties; Hangzhou City Sets One-Month Deadline for Applying for Exemption or Deferment</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch on the 12th] Military service registration in Jiangsu Province's sixty-three counties began on October 1st. The Suzhou Garrison District Command, to solicit the opinions of county governments and accelerate the progress of the work, will convene a military service conference in mid-October, bringing together the county magistrates and military affairs section chiefs of Suzhou, Wujiang, and Changshu counties to jointly discuss implementation. Regarding the question of whether civil servants currently in office should be required to serve, various levels of military service agencies have had many doubts. The Ministry of National Defense has now provided the following clarification: (1) Township and village chiefs concurrently serving as captains or squad leaders in the National Guard are to be considered as already serving in military auxiliary service during their tenure and are to be granted deferment of conscription. Those who are deemed incompetent are not subject to this exemption. (2) Township and village guard unit deputies in each county or city who perform with excellence during their service are to be granted deferment of conscription in accordance with the same criteria as those serving in military auxiliary service.</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch] Since the Hangzhou Municipal Government issued the order for conscription, there has been much discussion in the streets and alleys, and the township chiefs have been very busy. This is the first conscription in Hangzhou since the end of the war. According to an investigation with relevant authorities, the city has established a schedule for reviewing applications for conscription exemptions for this year's recruits and is now actively proceeding accordingly. The Zhejiang Military Region Command, in conjunction with the Department of Civil Affairs, has submitted a request to Chairman Shen for approval regarding the matter of recruits with exemption, suspension, or deferment qualifications paying a fee for deferment certificates when applying. The application period runs from October 5th to October 15th.</p>
<p>[Additional News] The Zhejiang Provincial Government meeting on the 11th decided to reinstate conscription this year. The original preferential treatment and financial assistance methods have been abolished. The Department of Civil Affairs will consult with the Military Region to collect fees for deferred conscription or call-up from recruits in accordance with the new Conscription Law. These funds will be used to provide preferential treatment to families of conscripts, and will be retained entirely within the county for local use, without being submitted to the province for deduction or unified allocation.</p>

<h3>Robbers Arrested in Wuxi</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxi Dispatch] The Tonghanzhen Self-Defense Force of the urban district, while patrolling on the evening of the Double Tenth Festival at 8 PM, apprehended a thief named Wang Ruimin.

<h3>Distributors Manipulate the Market; Kerosene Panic in Taixing</h3>
<p>[Our Taixing Dispatch] The market has recently experienced a shortage of kerosene, causing panic over fuel. Originally, Zhentai, Huachang, Dasheng, Taifeng, and other firms in Taixing were contracted to handle the distribution of Meifu, Guanghua, Asia, and Deshigu brands of kerosene in Taixing. However, because of the varying prices in the Taixing market, they conceived the idea of selling the kerosene allocated to them to places such as Diaojiapu in Taizhou at higher prices, causing a shortage of kerosene in Taixing and creating an opportunity for unscrupulous merchants to inflate prices. The county chamber of commerce has now requested that these four firms transport all the kerosene allocated to them back to the county for sale and has telegraphed the four companies, Meifu in Shanghai and others, urging them to instruct their managers not to transport the distributed kerosene for sale in other counties in the future, or else they will request that their distribution rights be terminated.</p>
<h3>Political Work Delegation to Comfort Recovered Areas of Northern Jiangsu Visits Nantong and Rugao; Chairman Wang of the Province Issues Six Instructions</h3>
<p>[Our Nantong Dispatch] Chairman Wang of Jiangsu Province, concerned about the hardships of the people in the Northern Jiangsu region, has specially dispatched Chen Dabao, the head of the Political Work Delegation to the Recovered Areas of Northern Jiangsu under the Provincial Security Command, to Northern Jiangsu for comfort.

<h3>Zhenjiang Secures Six Hundred Million Yuan in Industrial and Commercial Loans</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] The Zhenjiang County Provisional Assembly Standing Committee previously noted that since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Communist Party in Northern Jiangsu had incited chaos, obstructing transportation and causing most industries and businesses in the county to stagnate. Furthermore, the dumping of American goods and the failure of financial policies to adapt to the needs of the situation led to the rise of usury, placing industries and businesses in a state of drinking poison to quench thirst and reaching a dead end. Therefore, it was resolved to implement measures to curb usury and to request swift relief from the provincial government and banks. The county chamber of commerce also engaged in similar activities with various parties. Fortunately, with the support of Chairman Wang of the provincial government and Director Dong of the Department of Finance, the bank authorities agreed to consider the matter. A reporter from this newspaper, aware of the widespread concern about this issue, made a special visit to a person in charge of the chamber of commerce on the 11th. According to the discussion, the total amount of industrial and commercial loans secured by the county is only six hundred million yuan, which is a drop in the bucket. The central China, Agricultural, and Farmers' Three National Banks are still studying the procedures, and it is unknown when the funds will be disbursed. Currently, only the Jiangsu and Jiangsu provincial banks have been approved by the provincial government to prepare to begin lending, but the amount available is only sixty million yuan. It is also learned that various counties in Northern Jiangsu that have been restored are also preparing to request industrial and commercial loans from banks, as local industries and businesses are on the verge of bankruptcy.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Actively Under Repair; Jiangshan Section to Open Next Month; Zhuji-Jinhua Section to be Completed Within the Year</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 12th] The Quzhou-Jiangshan section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is undergoing active repair and is expected to open next month. The Zhuji-Jinhua section is expected to open within the year. The Jinhua-Quzhou section is still awaiting the arrival of materials, the most lacking of which are the rails. The Ministry of Transportation has promised to allocate 700,000 ties, and some will also be purchased locally, which should be sufficient. It is learned that a batch of imported rails will be allocated to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway for use, but even if they arrive in Zhejiang quickly, the opening of the entire line will have to wait until next year.</p>
<h3>Changshu Lacks Meat</h3>
<p>[Our Changshu Dispatch] Residents of this city have been unable to find meat to accompany their meals for days. Although there are still large quantities of fresh pork available in the pig markets, all the meat shops have stopped slaughtering and selling. It is reported that this is because people have been demanding to buy meat at prices below the market rate every day, causing meat merchants to suffer excessive losses, forcing them to close down.</p>
<h3>Robbery Occurs in Broad Daylight in Downtown Suzhou; Bridge Collapse at Park Sends Visitors Plunging into Water</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch] Since the second month of this year, although public security has been emphasized, robberies have occurred one after another, but robberies in broad daylight in downtown areas have been rare. At approximately 4:00 PM on the 10th, at the home of a Mr. Sun, the Suzhou distributor of the Shanghai Ruitai Soda Company, located at No. 24, First Heaven Gate in the city's central district, where he had been running a stamp business, he obtained a loan of three million yuan from a certain location and returned home. Because he failed to conceal the money, he attracted the attention of thieves. Two thugs dressed in blue cloth shirts and pants, one about thirty-one or two years old, the other seventeen or eighteen years old, followed him to the door. As Sun had not closed the door in his haste, the two thugs boldly entered the inner room. Sun was too frightened to make a sound as the older thug grabbed two bundles of banknotes, each containing one million yuan, while the younger thug stole one million yuan. After leaving the house, they fled in different directions. Sun, taken by surprise, was initially stunned. By the time the robbers had left, he realized they were unarmed and urgently called out to a Mrs. Mou, who was in the same room, to give chase. As Sun chased one of the robbers to the entrance of the North Bureau Park, he was about to catch up, but the robber threw the money to the ground and escaped without a trace. The other robber disappeared into the crowds along Guanqian Street. Sun, having lost two million yuan out of nowhere, has reported the incident to the local police station and requested that the robbers be apprehended.</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch] The city's only public recreation area is the Central Park. Whenever the weather is pleasant, visitors gather, creating a lively and bustling atmosphere. However, it has fallen into disrepair for the past eight years, with pavilions collapsing and bridges tilting, and is no longer in its former state. Although a Park Restoration Committee has been established after the local restoration, it has been unable to commence construction due to financial constraints. The 10th was National Day, and all agencies and schools in the city had a day off, resulting in a sudden increase in park visitors. At approximately 5:00 PM, a group of visitors were standing on the wooden Nine-Bend Bridge, leaning on the railings and watching the broken lotus stalks and withered stems in the pond when suddenly, with a loud crash, the Nine-Bend Bridge broke and collapsed, sending twelve male and female visitors plunging into the pond. Fortunately, soldiers from the Umbrella Hill Brigade, who were patrolling in the park, bravely rescued them, pulling them ashore one by one. Although no major disaster occurred, the twelve male and female visitors were covered in mud and water and were in a sorry state. Currently, the local media unanimously believes that the park should allocate rent received from numerous restaurants and tea houses leasing land in the park during the summer toward repairs and has urged the Park Restoration Committee to commence work as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Bandit Apprehended in Taizhou</h3>

Unexpectedly, the bandit learned of the operation and attempted to break out. An exchange of fire resulted in the bandit forces being overwhelmed. The bandit Fang Caigui was captured on the spot. Additionally, an eight-year-old hostage named Zhang Youcai, the son of the victim, was found in the Xiaotian area. The squad has already notified his family.</p>

<h3>Director of the Xuzhou Public Works Bureau Accused of Accepting a Puppet Position</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch] The case against Zheng Yaochen (also known as Zheng Gang), the Director of the Public Works Bureau of the Xuzhou Municipal Government, who is accused of being a traitor, was heard for the first time by the Criminal Division of the Third Branch of the High Court at 10:00 AM on the 7th, with Judge Qian Songsen presiding. According to Zheng's confession, he was from Jian'ou and later moved to Shanghai. He graduated from the Civil Engineering Department of Tongji University. Before the war, he served as a technician in the Qingdao Public Works Bureau and later as the acting director. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he returned to Shanghai. In July of the 30th year of the Republic of China, due to financial hardship, he was invited by a friend to come to Xuzhou and served as the chief clerk in the Transportation Section of the Construction Department of the Puppet Su-Huai Special District Administrative Office. He left in August of the 31st year. During his time in the puppet organization, he, along with the Puppet North China Construction General Office, opened Zhongshan Road and Zhongzheng Road in this city, and built the Jizhong and Qingyun bridges. When asked by the court why he had not thought of serving the country, having received a higher education, but had instead joined the puppet organization, Zheng stammered and hesitated. At 11:00 AM, the court ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody pending investigation.</p>
<h3>Su-Ning Branch Office Relief Work: Balancing Emergency and Work Relief While Assisting Northern Refugees to Return Home</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] Zheng Tonghe, Director of the Su-Ning Branch of the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA), held his first press conference yesterday to foster communication and relationships with reporters from various newspapers stationed in Zhenjiang. Attending were Jiang Renlong, Deputy Director of the branch office; Li Juesheng (an American), Director of the CNRRA Zhenjiang Branch; Head Secretary Hedley; Executive Secretary Anderson; and over twenty reporters stationed in Zhenjiang from Beijing and Shanghai. Director Zheng gave a brief report, stating that the Su-Ning Branch has been established for over nine months now. The initial period was spent on preparatory work, and substantive work gradually began between March and August of this year, almost a year ago. Future work can be divided into two parts: emergency relief and work relief. Emergency relief will focus on northern Jiangsu, while work relief will be province-wide, especially in the southern Jiangsu counties.</p>
<p>Jiangnan Work Relief</p>
<p>Currently, there are four work relief projects being actively pursued: first, water conservancy; second, roads; third, sanitation; and fourth, education. In water conservancy, we are jointly operating the Yangtze River levee restoration project with the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, the northern Jiangsu canal project with the Huai River Diversion Committee, the Jiangnan sea dike project and the Zhenwu section canal project with the Water Conservancy Commission and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and the Qinhuai River and southern Nanjing city sewer projects with the Nanjing Municipal Government. In roads, a contract has been signed with the Highway Administration of the Ministry of Transportation to allocate funds for the repair of the Beijing-Hankou National Highway and the Shanghai-Hangzhou National Highway. We are also cooperating with the Jiangsu Provincial Highway Bureau to repair important provincial roads. In sanitation, we are cooperating with the Department of Health and the Provincial Health Department to repair public and private hospitals in more than ten counties and cities, including Zhenjiang and Yangzhou. Construction of the provincial hospital has already begun. In education, many primary school buildings were destroyed during the war. We have now approved assistance for the repair of twenty school buildings, including the Zhenjiang Teachers' Affiliated Primary School, and we plan to repair twenty primary school buildings each month going forward.</p>
<p>Northern Jiangsu Emergency Relief</p>
<p>In terms of emergency relief, many counties in northern Jiangsu have been successively recovered due to the active military progress. However, the people have suffered greatly from military operations and man-made floods. After the recovery of Huaiyin, Huai'an, and Siyang, the branch office immediately sent personnel to inspect the situation and implement emergency relief. We also observed that in Suining, Suqian, and Siyang counties, 40% of the population were in situations where they had no access to medical care, clothing, or shelter. We are now exerting our utmost efforts to rescue these victims of political hardship. To facilitate relief, we have established an office in Huaiyin and have already allocated 200 tons of flour and 400 bales of old clothing from Xuzhou. To save time and meet urgent needs, the branch office dispatched ten trucks to Xuzhou. The road from Suining to Siyang is now open to traffic, but from Siyang to Huai'an, we have to use small carts and boats for transportation. In terms of health relief, we have contacted the Department of Health to send a medical team to the recovered areas in various counties to provide medical and pharmaceutical relief.</p>
<p>Distribution of Wheat Seeds</p>
<p>We are now preparing to distribute high-quality wheat seeds in Xuzhou, Suining, Suqian, and Siyang to increase next year's crop yield. Shuyang and Lianshui are about to be recovered, and we are also preparing for emergency relief work. In addition to actively providing relief to refugees in northern Jiangsu and Xuhai, we also need to assist refugees from Hebei and Shandong and refugees from the Northeast who are stranded in Xuzhou to return home. We have contacted the Shanghai Branch about this matter. Starting from the 8th of this month, the first batch of 500 refugees will be sent from Xuzhou to Shanghai, and then they will take ships from Shanghai to return to their hometowns. After that, every five days, we can transport 300 people per batch. There are approximately 4,000 refugees stranded in Xuzhou, and they will all be transported by the end of next month at the latest. Many refugees from northern Jiangsu are concentrated in Nanjing, Shanghai, Yangzhou, and Zhenjiang. The branch office has started registering refugees for their return home and will provide appropriate travel expenses based on the distance of each refugee's journey back to their hometown.</p>
<p>Making Winter Clothes</p>
<p>For other social welfare services, sewing factories have recently been newly established in Nanjing and Zhenjiang, and able-bodied women among the refugees are selected to rush to make winter clothes for distribution to refugees for warmth. Nutrition stations for children and the elderly have also been established in Nanjing and Zhenjiang, with fifteen stations in total. Every day, more than a thousand children and elderly people go to drink milk. We plan to extend this initiative to other areas in the near future. In addition, porridge distribution centers have been established in Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Xuzhou, Huaiyin, and Huai'an.</p>
<h3>Huainan Railway Operates Intermodal Transportation</h3>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch] The Huainan Railway is operating intermodal road-rail transport from Shuijiahu via Hefei to Yuxikou. After consultation with the Anhui Highway Bureau, it was implemented on the Double Ten Festival. Passengers are assigned seats on the buses, and route security is provided. There are intermodal ticketing offices from Bengbu via Shuijiahu, Hefei, and Yuxikou to Wuhu.</p>
<h3>Many Major Traitors Still at Large in Jiading: County Government Compiles List and Requests Arrest Warrants</h3>
<p>[Our Jiading Dispatch] Jiading was occupied for eight years, and local traitors and puppets acted as accomplices to the enemy, committing heinous crimes. Since the recovery, the county government and military police organs have successively reported them, but many important figures are still at large. Recently, the county government has clearly investigated and compiled a list of the traitors whose crimes are obvious and submitted it to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Jiangsu Provincial High Court, requesting that arrest warrants be issued promptly and they be punished according to law to prevent them from escaping justice.</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch] The Suzhou High Prosecutor's Office previously received a confidential report that the local Tao Xunsun, who operates movie theaters, was a traitor. Before the war, Tao founded the Da Guangming and Suzhou cinemas and the Xin Su Hotel in Suzhou. During the occupation, he colluded with the enemy and opened the Wei Ya and Xin Ya restaurants. He also opened theaters in Shanghai and Nanjing. When the puppet China Film Company was established, Tao served as the manager of the Suzhou branch. Tao surrendered himself on the 31st of last month and was interrogated. Prosecutor Wei Weiqing detained him after the interrogation. It has been confirmed that he committed traitorous acts, and he was prosecuted by the High Court on the 8th.</p>

<p>Yangzhou Hospital Suddenly Neglects the Poor and Sick</p>
<p>Editor: I am a refugee from northern Jiangsu. I am deeply saddened to see that the Provincial Yangzhou Hospital is superficially complying with the government's orders to alleviate the suffering of refugees but secretly defying them. Initially, the hospital stipulated that registration hours were from 2 to 4 PM every day (excluding holidays) for ordinary outpatient services (ordinary morning consultations). Suddenly, it adopted a bureaucratic tone of "limited time" and changed the hours to Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. For wealthy ordinary people, not only have Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays remained unchanged, but afternoon hours have even been added on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. This treatment is too unequal. Even private hospitals that are completely profit-oriented do not "only care about profit" like this. On behalf of the majority of refugees, I urge the hospital to quickly improve by (1) restoring the original hours and (2) simplifying procedures to increase the effectiveness of relief efforts. We would be eternally grateful! (Hu Fenghao)</p>
<p>Impoverished Students Seek Education</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>In today's situation where the problem of being unable to attend school is extremely serious, we students of Great China University have resolved our problems under the principle of cooperation with the school. Today, with boundless joy, we report our struggle process to students who have not yet secured their tuition to serve as a reference for them. The students of Great China University have always been disorganized, but this time, for their own personal issues, we are tightly united.</p>
<p>After the news that the educational loan funding was insufficient for distribution was released, the students were all worried. After much negotiation, under the pleas of all parties, the authorities decided to establish one hundred full tuition waivers and one hundred half-fee waivers. After the announcement was posted, more than four hundred students immediately signed up, which proves how seriously the tuition problem is threatening so many people! Because so many students applied and the original number of slots was insufficient, some of these four hundred students will inevitably not receive the loan funding, but we are still demanding that the school consider increasing the number of slots so that no student at Great China University is unable to attend school because they cannot pay tuition.</p>
<p>With full enthusiasm, we suggest that partners who are still hesitating outside the school gates summon their courage and sincerely request their school authorities to consider increasing the number of full tuition waivers or establishing scholarships. We believe that as long as it is not a diploma mill, the wise school authorities will definitely solve the difficulties for the students. We wish you success here! (A Group of Impoverished Students from Great China University)</p>
<p>Voices from Graduates of Vocational Training Classes</p>
<p>Editor: I am a young person who has been out of school for six years. After the victory, I was assigned by the Former Recruitment Association to the Nanjing Temporary Secondary School. During my studies, the association established a Wuhu Vocational Training Class. In order to support my livelihood and feeling that I was older, I resolutely registered and transferred to the class, hoping to learn a specialized skill from now on to repay the country and maintain my livelihood. Last April, at the opening ceremony of the class, the director said: "This class is a youth re-education and employment institution. The purpose is to cultivate a group of middle and lower-level cadres for national construction." The students were overjoyed to hear this. Now that the graduation period has arrived, the person in charge of the class declared: "Except for six students who have been assigned jobs and sixty students from northern Jiangsu who are allowed to be assigned to higher education, other students are willing to leave the class as soon as possible." Although I am a Jiangnan person, my suffering is no less than that of the people of Jiangbei. My mother lives with my uncle's family, and my father has been dead for nine years. When the group questioned him, he said: "I do not have this responsibility. If you do not believe me, you can ask the Ministry of Education." I think this is probably true, and he also has his own difficulties. However, if the Ministry of Education has taken huge amounts of funding to help a group of out-of-school youth but does not completely help them, what is the use? It wastes manpower, material resources, and financial resources regardless. Can these young people be able to return to school and get a job in the future? The certificate they received cannot be used to apply to schools or apply for jobs. Where are we going? Our enthusiasm for the country may be about to disappear. [Ma Rushan]</p>

<p>Reply to Mr. Er: Regarding your report that the Central Bank's one-hundred-city version of the five-hundred-yuan note is being refused in Beijing and Wuhu, the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank has replied to our newspaper, stating: "All versions of banknotes issued by the bank are universally valid throughout the country, except for those that are damaged and unusable, which can be exchanged for new banknotes at our branches at any time. Although the refusal situation mentioned by Mr. Xiao is accidental, it is of great importance to currency credibility and public sentiment and should be corrected with great effort. In addition to instructing our Beijing and Wuhu branches to ask the relevant authorities to pay attention and correct it, we are replying accordingly." Special reply.</p>

<h3>Treaty with Bulgaria Passed: No Changes to the Greek-Bulgarian Border</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Paris, 12th, United Press] After overturning the proposal of the Four Powers on the Greek-Bulgarian border, the Peace Conference completed the treaty with Bulgaria at 1:15 AM this morning, the third treaty completed in three days. Representatives from various countries refused to accept the terms of the treaty with Bulgaria passed by the Four Powers' foreign ministers, which denied Greece any opportunity to make changes to the Bulgarian-Greek border. This move by the representatives of the Peace Conference shocked the entire General Assembly today. Greece had previously insisted on certain changes to the border to avoid being attacked and to ensure security. The General Assembly adjourned after passing the Bulgarian treaty. It then continued to vote on the treaty with Hungary at 10:00 AM. When the General Assembly voted on the economic part of the Bulgarian treaty this morning, it also followed the precedent of yesterday's Romanian treaty.

At the same time, it was decided by a two-thirds majority to grant Bulgarian civil aviation equal opportunities.

It is reported that the Greek government has told Deppsey and Crow that it cannot save the current situation unless it obtains military equipment from the UK and mobilizes Greek farmers. It is observed that the British government is considering Greece's request with a cautious attitude. Unless Greek Prime Minister Tsaldares expands the Greek cabinet to include other parties, the UK's attitude towards Greece will become lukewarm. According to people close to the Foreign Office, the UK has instructed Greek King George that Greece must form a government that is more representative of the various parties.</p>

<h3>New Secretary of Commerce Harriman Issues Warning: US Should Be Vigilant Towards the Soviet Union; Explains Trends in Soviet Foreign Policy Based on Intelligence Gathered During His Tenure as Ambassador</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 11th] New Secretary of Commerce Harriman gave a speech yesterday at a joint meeting of representatives from the Army, Navy, and State Department. Based on intelligence gathered during his previous tenure as Ambassador to the Soviet Union, he explained the trends in Soviet foreign policy. He stated that Marshal Stalin and other Soviet leaders firmly believe that capitalism and communism cannot coexist in the same world. Because the Soviet Union has this belief, it has decided to adopt a policy that intends to obstruct all efforts by the UK and the US to solve global political problems. As for President Roosevelt, he originally believed that although the US and the Soviet Union have different systems, it is still possible to live in peace. However, in the last months of the war, the late president's views changed rapidly. If President Roosevelt were still alive today, he would undoubtedly promote President Truman and Secretary of State Bernays' policy towards the Soviet Union. As for myself, I had to change my original beliefs due to the various difficulties caused by the end of the European war and after the victory. At this moment, I believe that the Soviet Union's comprehensive autocratic system is incompatible with the US democratic system. In other words, the Soviet Union prohibits all freedom, while the US recognizes democratic freedom. Communism is indeed the real crisis in the world, and once it is touched, it is infected. Therefore, the current policy of the United States adopts great vigilance and expresses suspicion of the intentions of the Soviet Union in order to ultimately defend peace.</p>
<h3>Turkish President Calls for Unity Among All Political Parties</h3>
<p>[United Press, Istanbul, 10th] Although Turkey will reject the Soviet Union's request for joint defense of the Strait of Dardanelles, it seems that it will agree to negotiations with the Soviet Union to serve as a prelude to a meeting with other countries. At the same time, Turkish President Inonu declared to the leaders of the opposition party, the Democratic Party, that the Democratic Party and the ruling People's Party have no differences. He is a "supra-party" person. It is interpreted that his words are sufficient to indicate that he is trying to unite the domestic parties to cope with external crises. Some people say that it foreshadows Inonu's resignation as President of the People's Party.</p>
<h3>Soviet Military Reforms on a Large Scale to Adapt to Modern Warfare</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] Our Moscow correspondent, Tang Dong, has just returned from that area. The following is the situation of the Red Army's reform that he described:</p>
<p>Some foreign military attachés in Moscow said that the Soviet army is engaged in a large-scale post-war reform. The highest Soviet military authorities are conducting the most detailed and cautious research on modern warfare, especially atomic bombs, radar, jet and rocket-propelled aircraft, so that the army, navy, and air force can adapt to the latest scientific inventions. At the same time, the large-scale military demobilization work is still far from completion. With the expansion of the Soviet Union's eastern and western borders, military needs have also increased accordingly.</p>
<p>Army Streamlining</p>
<p>Some foreign observers have told reporters that the Soviet army is adopting a streamlined approach to reorganization, and the effectiveness of atomic bombs is being analyzed in detail for reference. In addition to increasing the mobility and independence of the army, consideration is also being given to increasing base supplies and reserves. The Red Army pays great attention to tank and artillery units, but it still considers infantry to be the main body of combat. The Soviet Air Force is making every effort to study the wartime tactics of the British and American air forces. The Soviet Air Force's heavy bomber force is relatively weak in strength and lacks combat knowledge. The main research focus of Soviet Air Force strategists is currently the complex large-scale air offensive. The Soviet Union has always kept secret the progress of post-war aircraft types, and very few outsiders know about it. During the Air Force Day exhibition held in Moscow a few weeks ago, foreigners were able to get a glimpse of the Soviet Union's new aircraft types when Marshal Stalin and the officers of the Political Bureau of the Supreme Command inspected them. The inspected aircraft included the latest four-engine bomber and jet and rocket-propelled fighters. The Soviet Navy is also actively expanding. Authoritative information published by officials and newspapers all indicates this. The number and area of shipyards have increased, and Soviet experts are studying the characteristics of ships obtained from the UK, the US, and former enemy countries. The newly acquired naval bases in the Baltic Sea and the Far East are being greatly expanded. The Soviet Union still considers the navy and air force to be auxiliary to the Great Continental Army. The official and newspaper remarks all claim that the Soviet Army is the backbone of the only Soviet socialist country in the world and is considered the hope of the proletariat all over the world. The government has told the people that it will maintain and improve the Great Army to prevent aggression by capitalists and reactionaries. Capitalism has always been regarded as the source of aggressive war, so as long as capitalism exists in the world, the strength of the Red Army must be maintained at its Greatness. The Soviet Union does not neglect the purpose of politicizing the military, and this work has been intensified recently. At the same time, it is also paying great attention to improving military discipline standards. Absolute obedience is the slogan of the Red Army. Some new military laws have been promulgated to achieve this goal. The training of officers is still not relaxed in the slightest. Young officers who have gained practical experience during the war are now busy searching for theory in books. The number of Soviet troops is a very strict secret. Although the phenomenon of demobilization can be seen everywhere in the Soviet Union, the authorities have not yet published any statistics. Therefore, even if outsiders speculate, it is very inaccurate. The estimated number is around two million.</p>
<h3>Unstable Portuguese Political Situation: Military Mutiny a Prelude to Revolution; Premier Salazar's Position Shaken</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 11th] Reports that Spanish troops had crossed the Portuguese border after a rebellion in Coimbra, Portugal, have been denied by responsible sources here. They stated that they are awaiting news of the outcome of the Coimbra rebellion. Britain has maintained friendly relations with Portugal for centuries and is particularly concerned about peace and order in that country. Rumors that the credibility of Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar has been shaken have not been denied by officials, and the possibility of a cabinet resignation is not ruled out. Diplomatic circles believe that Interior Minister Colonel Moniz, trusted by Prime Minister Salazar, may succeed him. On the other hand, President Carmona enjoys strong support from the army and may form a military government. It is almost certain that once Prime Minister Salazar leaves office, the situation in Portugal will become more difficult. [Reuters, Lisbon, 12th] According to unconfirmed reports, the Portuguese army has issued an ultimatum to the Salazar government, demanding the handover of power, or the army will take control of the entire country. This report comes as security measures in Lisbon and elsewhere in the country, taken in response to the mutiny in Obidos on Thursday, are gradually being relaxed. Traffic between Lisbon and Obidos, once disrupted, has resumed, and troops mobilized at the government's call remain stationed in Lisbon. Machine guns around Prime Minister Salazar's residence have not been removed. Although the government gazette stated that only 70 people participated in the Obidos mutiny and that it has been quelled, observers believe it is a prelude to a national revolutionary movement. Some even say the revolution will break out in Lisbon, and the mutiny was purely military-led. Rumors of communist involvement are hard to believe. Reliable reports are still lacking; it is only known that several people have been arrested and more will follow. So far, only the semi-official "Diário da Manhã" has commented on the matter, stating that the rebels are sabotaging national efforts and should not be spared.</p>
<h3>### Japanese Female Students Strike Against Haircut Ban</h3>

<h3>### Upcoming Opening of the UN General Assembly: Expected to Hold Over 400 Meetings; International Refugee Organization to be Discussed First</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 11th] The Soviet representative to the UN General Assembly, Molotov's advisor, Lappushov, arrived in New York today with his secretary.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 11th Dispatch] The agenda of the United Nations General Assembly has increased from the original 34 items to 53.

The Four Foreign Ministers Conference and the Security Council may be held concurrently with the United Nations General Assembly. As the United Nations General Assembly nears its end, the structure of various organizations will gradually take shape. It is expected that the United Nations General Assembly will hold 45 meetings, including 35 plenary sessions.

<h3>### France Deploys Air Force: Renewed Fighting in Vietnam; Innocent Civilians Bombed</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 11th] A state of armed truce had been maintained between the French colonial authorities in Vietnam and Annamese resistance fighters since the agreement of May 6. Today, news of new conflicts has emerged. The French and Annamese accuse each other of violating the agreement, and provocations occurred at Cape Varella in southern Annam province. French fighter planes participated in the fighting. According to French sources, 75 Annamese bodies were left on the battlefield. Annamese sources claim that about 2,000 French troops encircled Annamese positions, and an unknown number of French fighter planes attacked civilians in the area. They stated that the French attack was repelled with heavy losses.</p>
<h3>### Soviet Union and Germany Hold Dissenting Views on Establishing International Armed Forces</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 12th] The "New York Times" reported today that the Soviet Union opposes the establishment of a permanent international force to be used by United Nations agencies to maintain world peace. The Soviet Union is against assigning troops to United Nations agencies before any crisis occurs. This point is evident in the memorandum submitted by the Soviet delegation to the Military Committee of the Security Council in September. The points it advocates are almost entirely different from those of the representatives of the United States, Britain, China, and France on the Military Committee. The Soviet Union's interpretation of the UN Charter's provisions for the establishment of a peacekeeping force is that such a force should not be designated to be under the control of the Security Council until it is actually needed.</p>

<h3>Preparations for Chairman's 60th Birthday: 41 Organizations and Groups Recommended to Host Celebrations; Three Methods Determined, Including Statue, School Donation, Etc.</h3>
<p>Shanghai Celebrates Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Sixtieth Birthday. All the sponsors held a general meeting at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Those present included Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Kong Xiangxi, Fang Xikong, Du Yuesheng, Guo Yunguan, Xu Jiguan, Li Ximou, Li Jianhua, Wang Xiaolai, Yong Xiangming, Xi Yuwan, Li Fusun, Hou Junren, Yu Yunzhu, Zhou Feicheng, Pang Jingzhou, and other representatives from over 400 groups and associations. Wu Guozhen chaired the meeting. After the meeting was formally opened, Chairman Wu reported that the celebration of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's sixtieth birthday was initiated by the Shanghai Municipal People's Assembly, so President Pan should be the chairman, but because Pan had an important report, he was recommended to represent as the general chairman. The name of this meeting today is "Shanghai Celebrates Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Sixtieth Birthday Sponsors' Conference". I think no one among Shanghai's four million people would disagree or not want to be a sponsor, but because of the size of the place, it cannot accommodate everyone, so I specially invited you to represent the people of the whole city to hold this conference. Then Director Fang Xikong delivered a speech, saying that celebrating Chiang Kai-shek's sixtieth birthday is a truly heartfelt initiative of the people of Shanghai. The school donation and birthday celebration initiated in this city have already been responded to by various provinces and cities, which proves that the whole country is united in celebrating enthusiastically. We deeply know that the most important thing for national construction is education, and there are countless people who need education. Moreover, the world of the future is one of competition in strength and intelligence. At this time, donating a school is a grand plan for a hundred years, hoping that this work will be completed quickly so that children can all have books to read, and I think the Chairman will also agree. Then Kong Xiangxi delivered a speech, saying that the meaning of school donation and birthday celebration is very long. I think (1) this school donation should be entirely voluntary by the people, without compulsion, otherwise it will lose its original meaning, which the Chairman would not want to see. (2) Create specialized talents who can apply what they have learned, so that people's lives can be improved. I also hope that those who preside over this matter in the future will not seek vanity, but seek practicality.</p>

<h3>Wounded Soldiers'慰劳团：First团Arrives Shanghai</h3>

<p>###財局 Investigates：Citywide Household Rent</p>
<p>[本报讯] In order to implement the two resolutions of the Council, the Municipal Finance Bureau said: "(1) The housing donation for the autumn and winter seasons of this year will be 20% of the actual rent paid, which will be borne by the landlord. The rent will first be collected from the tenant, and then the tenant will deduct it from the rent. (2) Municipal construction donations will be collected. This donation is within a lump sum, minus the housing donations to be borne by the landlord. The remaining balance will be the municipal construction donation, which will be borne by the tenant."

<h3>A Blood Case Six Years Ago: White Russian Regiment Kills孤军; Murderer Michiyakov Arrested After Victory;地院's First Instance Testimony Yesterday Was Vague</h3>
<p>[本报讯] Six years ago, the case of He Yuxiang, a soldier of my四行孤军, being shot and killed by a团丁 of the White Russian Merchant Regiment of the former Public Concession was reported to the High Procuratorate after the victory. The murderer Michiyakov was detained, but because the case was an ordinary criminal case, it was transferred by the High Procuratorate to the District Procuratorate to file a public prosecution.</p>
<p>The District Court's Eighth Criminal Tribunal first heard the case yesterday afternoon. Michiyakov testified: 25 years old, joined the万国商团 in 1940, and was assigned to serve at the孤军营 on Singapore Road on September 18, 1929 of the Republic of China. That day was the anniversary of "September 18". The defendant was ordered to serve at the first post. At about 11:00 AM that day, about hundreds of citizens gathered around the孤军营. Many soldiers of the孤军营 climbed the walls and incited the crowd, so passers-by started to encircle and beat the guards. At that time, the situation was very tense. The defendant was frightened and lost his mind. He intended to fire a shot into the sky as a warning, but he could not hold it steady due to 神 轻紧张, so he did not know that he had killed anyone at that time. It was not until the next day that the newspaper reported that one soldier of the 孤军营 had been killed." The defendant Mikiyakov neither denied nor admitted the killing. Qiao Mailin (deputy captain of the White Russian Regiment) and Luo Bainov (the person in charge of investigating the case that year) testified in court. Both witnesses said that they were not eyewitnesses at the time, but they heard gunshots. The defendant's defense lawyer Liu Jiangang raised two points: (1) Three minutes after Michiyakov fired the shot that day, Ra希合维支 of the seventh post also fired a shot, so it remains to be confirmed whether the bullet that hit He Yuxiang was fired by Michiyakov. (2) According to Article 22, Paragraph 2, Section 1 of the 孤军营 Guard Training Order, "If a guard is attacked, or to prevent violent coercion, and armed disarmament, he may fire without the order of a superior." Therefore, the defendant's firing of the gun does not constitute a crime. He also requested that the prosecutor Ji Su, who was handling the case, provide evidence and requested a change of date for retrial, so that there would be sufficient time to collect evidence. The court approved his request and changed the retrial to 2:00 PM on the 22nd of this month.</p>
<h3>In Retrospect: Remembering the Past</h3>
<p>It is said that at that time, the Japanese army repeatedly negotiated with the Shanghai Municipal Council to take over the Isolated Battalion, but were refused. However, the Municipal Council's control over the Isolated Battalion camp became increasingly strict. White Russian merchants were dispatched to closely guard the surroundings of the camp. On September 14th, a conflict arose because the merchants erected barbed wire at a certain entrance of the camp, displeasing the soldiers. The White Russians used tear gas and fire hoses against the Battalion, and blockaded the camp. This dispute was the prelude to a bloody incident. After the incident, the late Xie Jinyuan, commander of the Isolated Battalion, issued a sorrowful statement, saying in brief: "The camp's perimeter wall facing the road is equipped with barbed wire, and a bathhouse is located below the wall. It has become customary for the brothers to talk there. Today (the 18th) at 11:50 AM, several soldiers were speaking outwards through the gaps in the barbed wire. Unexpectedly, a White Russian guard standing a few steps away raised his gun and aimed to stop them. The brothers ignored him, and the White Russian immediately opened fire, the bullet entering through the forehead and penetrating the brain, resulting in immediate death. At the same time, another White Russian standing on the left also raised his gun and aimed, injuring one soldier. Life and death are of no concern. We are prepared to sacrifice ourselves at any time for justice and world civilization, and are determined to fight to the end at any cost. We hereby request the Shanghai public, that after our sacrifice, please collect our bones and return them to our government..." The arduous situation of the Isolated Battalion at that time can be seen from this announcement. Today, after the victory, the old case is brought up again, how can it not evoke memories?</p>

<h3>Food Loan Fraud Case Transferred to District Procuratorate for Investigation; Chairman Cancels Original Verdict, Deeming it Erroneous</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The case of Wang Xunzhi et al. of the Shanghai Yangtze Enterprise Company hoarding grain for illicit profits, and Wang Daren et al. of the Shanghai Grain Administration Office of the Ministry of Food engaging in corruption and dereliction of duty, was previously reviewed by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters.

<h3>Heads Bowed, Silently Speechless, This Person Alone is Withered; Yuan Meiyun Quietly Returns; A Swarm of People Gathered Before the Shanghai Prison Gates, Eager to See the Final Act of a Tragic Comedy</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] This is a tragic comedy, which played out its final act yesterday—film star Yuan Meiyun was sentenced to six months in prison for opium addiction, and has been released after serving her term.</p>
<p>At daybreak, a large crowd had gathered in front of the Shanghai Prison gates, with countless eyes fixed on the exit. Winding and turning, they passed through the gates. In front of the tightly closed iron gates of the women's prison, reporters and Yuan's relatives anxiously waited. Reporters searched everywhere for Wang Yin's trace, but everyone was disappointed.</p>
<p>At precisely 8:00 AM, the large gate opened, and two bailiffs in yellow uniforms walked out, followed by a woman with a sallow complexion. She wore a qipao with red background and blue horizontal stripes, covered with a light blue short woolen coat. She wore flesh-colored stockings and two-tone shoes with white and brown trim. Her hair was cut very short, and was dry and dull. She held a mesh bag in one hand, and covered her mouth with a handkerchief in the other. Wearing wide-rimmed sunglasses, she lowered her head and stepped out of the women's prison gates. The mesh bag was immediately taken by relatives, and she silently followed the bailiffs to the District Procuratorate on Rue Loukas, to complete the release procedures.</p>
<p>This is Yuan Meiyun, the once immensely popular "Little Actress," and the lithe and youthful "Avatar Girl" and the stunning "Xi Shi" on the screen! However, seeing her sallow, swollen face caused by malnutrition and indigestion, and covered with scrofula, who could not feel a pang of sorrow for this once radiant star!</p>
<p>She boarded the Qi Ming Transportation Company's ten-seater jeep that had been prepared and drove straight to the District Procuratorate. In the car, she kept her head down, the black sunglasses and white handkerchief covering two-thirds of her face. Reporters tried various ways to coax her into talking, but all failed. She remained silent throughout.</p>
<p>At 8:25 AM, she arrived at the District Procuratorate. She got out of the car and was escorted into the criminal defendant waiting room. People curious and eager to get a look at her were constantly flowing towards the iron bars of the small room to peek at her. Yuan Meiyun—this person who had been imprisoned for six months and was about to regain her freedom—was pacing back and forth inside, her mind filled with confusion. Only those who have experienced the taste of losing freedom know how precious freedom is. How long each moment was for her at this time!</p>
<p>The reporters wanted to talk to her. Since she was silent, the lawyer who had been entrusted to pick her up relayed: "My mind is in chaos today, I don't know where to start. Let's talk another day."</p>
<p>Someone grumbled, "People fear fame, pigs fear fattening." For anyone else, would so many people come to see her and surround her today? Others sighed in injustice: to lock her in this small room, allowing people to constantly peek through the iron bars, is this not like watching an animal in a zoo? What a cruel form of abuse!</p>
<p>Finally, at 9:25 AM, she was brought to court. Prosecutor Chuan Bang took the stand and asked her name, age, place of origin, address, etc. Yuan replied, "Twenty-nine years old, originally from Hebei, residing at 12 Hengye Lane, Zhongzheng Road. I was arrested on April 12th of this year, and entered the detention center on April 16th. The District Court sentenced me to six months." The prosecutor informed her that the term of execution had expired and that she was being released today. He told her not to take it again after going out. Yuan lowered her head and said nothing. Then, she gave her fingerprints and signed the bond. The prosecutor wrote the words "released" heavily on the paper. The film star, who had been imprisoned for six months, regained her freedom at this point. The time was 9:30 AM. She lowered her head and hurriedly stepped out of the courtroom. Relatives stepped forward to help her, and together they jumped into the light gray, brand-new car that had been prepared. Her old mother had been sitting in the car since early morning, waiting until now. Meiyun fell into her arms, the car started, and sped away.</p>

<h3>Newly Appointed Municipal Party Committee Members Fang Zhi and Others to be Sworn in Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, Fang Zhi, Secretary-General Xie Renzhao, and other committee members are scheduled to take the oath of office at the Municipal Stadium at 9:00 AM tomorrow. Wu Jingheng, a supervisor specially appointed by the Central Government, will be the oath administrator.</p>
<h3>Municipal Party Committee Secretary-General Xie Discusses Future Work Guidelines</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Secretary-General of the Municipal Party Committee, Xie Renzhao, expressed his views on the future party affairs guidelines, stating briefly: I am honored to have been ordered to assist, but I could not decline, and I feel apprehensive. However, I believe that party affairs work is an obligation of party members to the party, and it is by no means comparable to holding an official position. In the future, I will continue to uphold the spirit of serving society and devote myself to various social undertakings. As for the work guidelines, my intentions are no more than the following four points: (1) To conduct party activities with a political party style. The essence of the Kuomintang is by no means a party that practices one-party dictatorship. Its ultimate goal is to return power to the people. The National Congress is about to convene, and the country is entering a constitutional period. In the future, the party should conduct party activities with a political party style, so that policies can better penetrate the masses and gain their support. (2) To use the will of the people as the basis for publicity. In a democratic country, sovereignty resides in the people. Today, in a democratic country, it is necessary to grasp the will of the majority of the people before formulating policies and publicizing them to society to promote the implementation of the government. The revival of China's nation-building places the primary emphasis on people's livelihood. The publicity of party affairs in this city will prioritize benefiting the national economy and people's livelihood, and reflecting the will of the people. Cultural education is an essential element in improving life and must not be overlooked. (3) To strive for progress in democratic politics through party and government innovation movements, with the goal of eliminating corruption and improving the atmosphere. (4) To maintain reasonable contact with other parties with a free attitude of research. Democracy and freedom are inseparable, and democracy and the rule of law should be integrated. Those who despise freedom are not truly democratic, and those who undermine the law are not free. The freedom of political parties must be mutually respected, and the laws of the country depend on the public for maintenance. Although the views of political parties may differ, the attitude must be friendly. In this way, the majority of the people can know what to choose, and various parties can maintain contact, jointly serving society and benefiting the people. Xie continued: In the future, the nation's affairs will take the National Assembly and the formulation of a constitution as the only step towards achieving democratic constitutionalism. The National Congress has been scheduled to convene, and we are looking forward to the efforts of all parties.</p>
<h3>Former Public Training Students Present Banner to Li Xiangqi</h3>
<p>It is found that the citizens in Shanghai who received public training in the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), defended Nanshi to the last moment during the "August 13th" War of Resistance.

<h3>Boundless Bitterness and Endless Agony: Miss Fei Man'er, a Renowned Chinese Violinist, Strives On; She Encounters a Heartrending Tragedy on Her Life's Journey; from Her Four Strings Comes the Sound of Utter Grief</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] Martin Luther once said, "Music is God's best gift to mankind." However, as we receive this beautiful and moving gift, we may forget how much hardship, struggle, and bitter effort the transmitters of this gift have undergone in order to contribute this spiritual sustenance to others. The reporter here wishes to introduce Miss Fei Man'er, a famous Chinese violinist, who is one such person.</p>
<p>If you are interested in music, if you have lingered in Chongqing or Chengdu, you must know or have heard the name Fei Man'er. I am not willing to extravagantly praise Miss Fei's art, but I dare say that Miss Fei's achievements and status in today's Chinese music circle are by no means easy, especially considering the heartrending tragedy she has encountered in her life's journey, which deserves our sympathy and admiration. The tragic death of Miss Fei's husband, Major Zeng Peifu, the leader of the Third Squadron of the Air Force, was the biggest blow in her life. However, for the past three years, in order to strengthen the courage of the anti-Japanese air force, Miss Fei has never forgotten her own responsibility, continuing to travel around, bringing the crystallization of her heartbreaking tears from her four strings to them. The day before yesterday, on Double Tenth Day (October 10th), Miss Fei was invited by the Hangzhou Jianqiao Air Force Officer School to specially lead a small music group to participate in a performance. The reporter was fortunate enough to have this opportunity to accompany them to enjoy the performance and have a conversation with Miss Fei.</p>
<p>Her Father Passed Away Early</p>
<p>Miss Fei Man'er is from Hangzhou and is only twenty-six years old this year. Her father used to be a teacher at a local school, but he passed away early. Miss Fei's mother placed all her hopes on her only daughter. When she was six years old, she began to urge her to learn the piano, and when she was twelve years old, she also started to learn the violin. At that time, Miss Fei's family still lived in Hangzhou, but every weekend, she came to Shanghai to study the violin with Professor Pudo Higa, a famous Austrian violinist here. Even today, she is still diligently studying with the old professor. Miss Fei studied at the National Academy of Art for six years, but after graduation, she never gave up continuing her studies. In 1937, she participated in the examination of the London College of Music in Shanghai and obtained a diploma from the college.</p>
<p>A Loving Mother Grieves, Then Passes Away</p>
<p>After the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Miss Fei went to the interior. Seven years ago, she married Major Zeng Peifu. However, it was also because of this matter that she encountered her second unfortunate experience. At that time, she was only nineteen years old. Miss Fei's mother, for the sake of her daughter's future, did not want her to marry too early, fearing it would affect her musical prospects, which often made her depressed, and she eventually died of cerebral hemorrhage the following year.</p>
<p>In addition to feeling heartbroken, Miss Fei could only use her musical accomplishments to comfort her loving mother in the afterlife. On the one hand, she was also encouraged by her husband. "My husband has always encouraged me to make good progress. His sincerity and urging made me dare not relax my studies again," Miss Fei said. Then, Miss Fei began her tragedy.</p>
<p>Her Husband Perished in a Plane Crash</p>
<p>Major Zeng was a graduate of the sixth class of the Air Force Officer School. In the early years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he participated in more than forty battles and made outstanding achievements. When the enemy's fighter planes first invaded our air force's airspace to engage in combat, Major Zeng was one of them. In that fierce battle, more than forty air force soldiers sacrificed half of their lives. Among the other half, some were seriously injured, and some retreated halfway. Only Major Zeng continued to pursue and returned safely, earning a special commendation. However, heaven was merciless. Three years ago, Major Zeng was working as a training officer in Karachi, India. Once, while demonstrating flight techniques with several Allied soldiers, his plane unfortunately crashed and he died on the spot. At this time, he was only twenty-eight years old. We can imagine how Miss Fei in Chengdu felt at that time! Miss Fei is an affectionate girl, but she is brave.</p>
<p>From that time on, she struggled in the pain of blood and tears with her three-year-old daughter, Xiao Manli, and the newborn little boy, as well as her violin, another sustenance of her life.</p>
<p>Her Child Fell Ill and Died</p>
<p>Last winter, Miss Fei came to Shanghai. I really couldn't believe that there could be such a tragic tragedy in the world, but the facts were right in front of you. This New Year, her little boy, who looked just like his father, also died of meningitis! Tears like a spring gushed from Miss Fei's eyes, and I no longer had the courage to speak. "The people in the Air Force are so good to me, but the pain in my heart cannot be compensated by anything," Miss Fei's short two sentences are more profound and sad than any sad words I could use to describe!</p>
<p>"But, for the sake of my six-year-old daughter (who has now started learning the piano), for the sake of my dead mother, husband, and child, I must live on." Miss Fei moved me to the point of speechlessness.</p>
<p>Preparing to Go to the United States for Further Study</p>
<p>In addition to continuing to practice the violin, Miss Fei is also studying singing with the famous professor Hisslin. She is preparing to go to the United States for further study and is applying for a passport for her daughter, because this is her last and most intimate companion. Miss Fei is very intelligent. She can not only speak fluent English, but also speak Russian, because she has often lived in her teacher Professor Pudo Higa's home since she was a child. In addition, she can also drive airplanes and cars.</p>
<p>Miss Fei is indeed an extremely unfortunate person, but in this war, there are many people in the world who are more unfortunate and pitiful than you. You are still so young, you have unlimited prospects, and God has given you talent, which not every unfortunate person can get. The country needs talents like you, and we sincerely hope that you "put away your painful moans and offer your innocent heart." For the sake of your ideals, move forward bravely. Wish you success! (The above picture is a recent photo of Miss Fei taken by this newspaper)</p>

<h3>Yang Wendao Pronounced Not Guilty; Ten Years of Wrongful Imprisonment Reversed in a Day; He Bowed Repeatedly After Hearing the Verdict, Bursting into Tears of Gratitude; He Will Report and Sue the Police Detective Who Gave False Testimony on That Day</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] At 1:45 PM yesterday, Yang Wendao and his son, Hanzhi, walked into the Second Court of the High Court, silent and with tense expressions, waiting for the final decision on his fate. When the court called his name, the atmosphere suddenly changed, Yang Wendao also smiled, bowing frequently to the court, and calmly walked out of the courtroom, now a free man.</p>
<p>The High Court held a collegial panel hearing yesterday, with the presiding judge being [name missing], judge Wang Ke [name missing], Zhang Shijie, and [name missing] prosecutor Jiang Gongliang; Yang Wendao's defense lawyer was still Tang [name missing] Qun. The interrogation began at 2:15 PM and was very strict, with many feeling uneasy for Yang Wendao. At 4:10 PM, the debate was announced to be over, and the judges retired to deliberate. At 4:30 PM, the judges returned to their seats, and the presiding judge, with a smile on his face, sat down and stood up to pronounce the verdict, reading the main text: "In the case of Yang Wenjin's murder, the original judgment is revoked, and Yang Wendao is not guilty." Yang Wendao bowed to the court after hearing the verdict, and his eyes were filled with tears due to extreme emotion! The audience was silent during the verdict, and then erupted [missing text] when the verdict was delivered. Judge [missing text] also leaned forward to Yang with a smile, nodding. When reporters offered their hands to Yang and his son [missing text], they were overcome with emotion and thanked them profusely. Lawyer [missing text] was extremely happy because of his success.</p>
<p>At 2:15 PM, the court summoned Yang Wendao, and the atmosphere suddenly became tense. Five large stacks of case files were piled on the court table, each stack more than a foot high. The presiding judge, whose vision was obstructed, specially ordered a bailiff to set up another chair behind the judge's seat to place these documents, but because the stacks were too high, they seemed about to fall.</p>
<p>Yang Wendao wore a beige suit, which was quite neat. He was almost unrecognizable compared to when reporters interviewed him in prison last winter. He wore yellow leather shoes. According to Yang Wendao, he was wearing these shoes when he was arrested ten years ago. In the police station, Japanese police officers ordered him to take off the shoes and used them to hit his head indiscriminately to force a confession, causing him to faint. Yang Wendao announced to be not guilty.</p>
<h3>Tortured After Arrest; Conspired to Falsely Accuse Wu Tiecheng</h3>
<p>The court first asked about his age and place of origin. Yang replied that he was fifty-two years old and from Zhongshan, Guangdong. Then asked about the grounds for the appeal, Yang immediately replied that he knew nothing about the assassination of Nakayama Hideo. At 10:00 AM on April 19, 1936, he was going out to attend a funeral when he met Tan Sheng pacing in front of his alley residence. When Tan saw Yang, his face turned red and he looked very uneasy. Yang immediately asked him why he was there, and Tan replied that he was visiting a friend. After walking past three or four shops, Chen Rongsheng, who was walking with Yang, turned around and saw Tan waving to the rear. Three or four people in Western-style suits rushed forward, grabbed his hands from behind, handcuffed him, and dragged him into a car with the letters SMP on it, which drove to the Dithway Road Police Station. He immediately asked why he was arrested, and a Japanese police officer replied that he would know slowly. That night, the Japanese military wanted to transfer him to the headquarters, but the police station authorities did not allow it, so he was sent to the Central Police Station and then to the District Court the next morning. No public prosecution was brought against him that day. The next day, Ye Haisheng was arrested and sent to court together, accused of being the murderer of Nakayama Hideo. Because Yang really didn't know the details, he refused to admit it. After he was arrested, the police station searched his home, and a Western police officer found a book, raised it and asked him if it was his. He said that it was a book in which he hid his pistol, but the original book was actually in English. After Ye Haisheng was arrested, he was taken to the "special room" on the fourth floor every midnight and subjected to severe torture. His knees rotted from kneeling on gravel. People in the police station told him that if he could confess that Wu Tiecheng, the former mayor, and Tang Haian, the customs superintendent of Jianghai, instigated him and that Wu and others gave him 150,000 yuan as the assassination price, he could be exempted from punishment. However, he would rather be tortured every night and never yield. Unexpectedly, when the District Court opened the trial, he was not allowed to speak and was sentenced to death, which was a great injustice, so he refused to accept the judgment and appealed.</p>
<h3>Presiding Judge's Inquiry Lasted an Hour</h3>
<p>Then the presiding judge began a thorough and sharp inquiry, lasting more than an hour. Yang Wendao recounted that the Hongshun Mutual Aid Society was established in 1930 as a charitable organization that ran schools and provided job placement. Ye Haisheng was also a member of the society. The source of funding was shared by all members. Yang flatly denied that he and Ye Haisheng had drawn lots in the Hongshun Society to decide to assassinate Nakayama Hideo. Regarding the book with a hole for hiding a pistol, the court asked: What book was it? Answer: It was an English book, I don't know what book. Question: Was it Practical Physics? Answer: I didn't know at the time. Question: You don't know English, why would you use an English book? Answer: I found it in the warehouse. Question: Later you saw a Chinese physics book? Answer: I read it carefully when [text missing] and knew the book was not mine.</p>
<p>Question: You are not a soldier, why do you have a pistol? Answer: This was mentioned earlier by [text missing], the mayor of Wen Hongen, who lent it to me, but I returned the gun to [text missing] before I returned to Guangdong. Question: Why was it placed in the book? Answer: Because there were many children at home, my cousin Yang Jianzhong suggested putting it in a book with a hole in it. Question: Were there bullets? Answer: Yes, six rounds. Question: Why did you admit it before? Answer: Ye Haisheng admitted it, but I never admitted it. Question: Why did Hua Haisheng admit it? Answer: He later told me in prison that he couldn't bear the torture. The Japanese systematically called Ye [text missing] and then called me to implicate Mayor Wu and Tang Haian. Question: How do you know? Answer: The Western detective [text missing], said that if I implicated those two, I could avoid torture. Question: Did you go to Ye Haisheng's performance? Answer: I never knew about it. Ye was detained at the Chengdu Road Police Station, and I was detained at the Central Police Station. Question: One of the witnesses that year was Zhang Zhu? Answer: Zhang Chen [text missing] Ceng Yuanjia, Zheng Weimin, Tan Sheng, etc. formed [text missing] and willingly obeyed the Japanese' instructions, creating the incident and framing China. Later, Zhang Chen, out of conscience, confessed the past situation and asked Ceng Yuan[missing text] to tell them that if they could implicate Yang Wendao, everyone would be in line. However, Zhang Chen was detained in the police station that night and was tortured again. Question: How do you know? Answer: I heard Zhang Chen say it in court later. Question: The Chinese physics book is not yours, what evidence do you have? Answer: It never came into my hands, so I don't know anything about it. Question: [Text missing] Is there oil on the hole [missing text]? Answer: The book was later sent to Zhenru for inspection. According to the court clerk, there was oil on it, as if it had just been taken off the gun, but the gun hand had already dried. There were PC prints in the hole, and the inspectors also said that they were pressed out temporarily. There were fourteen fingerprints on the book, and none of them matched my fingerprints. Yang Wendao stated that when he mentioned Ye Haisheng, [text missing] detective once [text missing] forced him to kneel in front of Ye, using Yang's [text missing] to beat Yang's head severely, and using small stones [text missing] under his knees to force Yang to confess.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Jiang's Three Points of Prosecution</p>
<p>After the interrogation, Prosecutor Jiang stood up and stated three points: (1) The original trial said that Yang Wendao instigated Ye Haisheng to kill Nakayama Hideo. The most important basis was Ye's confession. However, Ye's confession was inconsistent, sometimes saying that Meng Yang was involved, and sometimes saying that he was not. It was said that Ye's confession came from torture, first being punched and rubbed on the ribs, and water being poured into his mouth. According to the inspection report at the time, the situation seemed reliable, and he suffered torture, probably more than once. His confession was chaotic and could not be adopted. (2) The physics text for Yang Wendao's self-defense pistol was in English [text missing] The physics text for the pistol used for the murder was in Chinese. Although the appearance was similar, it did not match. And the inspection [text missing] had [text missing] traces of digging. When Zhang Chen testified, he said that [text missing] Ceng Yuan [text missing] Guo Hui [text missing] and others wanted to plot a reward, colluding to frame him. Ceng’s brother had already proven in another [text missing] that it was difficult to become a traitor and had a relationship with the Japanese, specializing in using the power of the Japanese to act illegally in the Hongkou area. Therefore, Zhang Chen’s confession was quite credible. (3) The circumstances of Haisheng's practice of committing the crime were indeed under threat. In addition, the motivation for Yang Wentong's crime [text missing] said that Yang wanted to kill the Japanese and create the power of his association in Hongkou. However, at that time, Hongkou was within the sphere of influence of the Japanese. Killing the Japanese only prompted the Japanese to eliminate the association. At that time, the situation was special, and the Japanese did not hesitate to make sacrifices and wanted to create a serious incident. Based on the above, the prosecutor believes that Yang Wendao's criminal suspicion is not sufficient.</p>
<h3>Lawyer's Defense</h3>
<p>Lawyer Tang continued to defend, saying: Today's trial of this case is in a free atmosphere, but when this case happened that year, the situation was very serious. Residents of Hongkou moved away one after another. At that time, the Minister of Military and Political Affairs, He Yingqin, and Mayor Wu Tiecheng, specially dispelled rumors and reassured the people. On that day, Prosecutor Zhang insisted that the defendant should be found not guilty in order to maintain the dignity of Chinese law. But within a week, the atmosphere became extremely tense, and the court even canceled the end of the debate and conducted another trial. The defendant [text missing] was sentenced to death - based on the facts at that time.</p>
<p>(1) From the perspective of the judge, the deceased was only five centimeters away from the shooter, while Ye Haisheng's performance [text missing] was [text missing] zhang away. At that time, the shoe store clerk Hu Xianghe, who [text missing] testified that [text missing] wore clothes similar to those of the murderer. Pay special attention to this. (2) The lawyer Zhang Shizhu of the police station once copied the book in American English, but later it changed [text missing] The Chinese version. (3) [Text missing] The performance was called pushing five people around, which was a serious “director 1”, not a “performance.” (4) [Text missing] is a member of Hong [text missing], Yang is the president, so the Japanese wanted [text missing] Ye to implicate Yang, and then [text missing] Yang to evaluate [text missing] the chief. (5) Unexpectedly, Yang [text missing] firmly refused to confess, so another plan was born to force Ye Haisheng to admit it, which was used as a final decision. When lawyer Tang finished his defense, he [text missing] to the Central Party Headquarters to prove [text missing] Qiu [text missing] Please [text missing] no translation, [text missing] to receive [text missing]. Yang Wendao [text missing] Li [text missing] [text missing] the chief to reverse his ten years of [text missing]. [Text missing] Gao [text missing] finally finalized [text missing] after [text missing] chasing [text missing] [text missing] Yang Wendao's verdict.</p>
<p>According to [text missing] Luo; After the verdict in this case is final, Yang Wendao will not only [text missing] Gao Zeng Yuan and others for false testimony [text missing] but will also [text missing] the police detective of the shooting police station for using non- [text missing]. Those who have been poisoned by the tea of those who have [text missing] [text missing] [text missing] [text missing] [text missing] offer [text missing] the facts. I heard [text missing] [text missing] also intend to ask the government for compensation for the wrongful imprisonment on behalf of Yang.</p>
<h3>Review of the Preliminary Design of the Pudong Bridge; Using Tunnels Estimated to Cost Approximately 80 Billion</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Engineering Bureau is in charge of the problem of building a bridge or tunnel across the Huangpu River. After the Shanghai River Crossing Engineering Committee entrusted the China Bridge Company to design it, the preliminary design was sent to the River Crossing Engineering Committee's Technical Group Advisory Committee for review. It was decided that if a bridge was built, a double-opening movable bridge [text missing] would be adopted. The net headroom under the bridge is ten meters above the highest flood level. The width of the bridge is twelve meters, plus a sidewalk [text missing] three meters wide, for a total width of eighteen meters, with a slope of 4%, and a net height inside the bridge of six meters.

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs hosted a routine board meeting of the China Textile Construction Company yesterday afternoon and met with reporters. He stated that the position of Chairman of the Textile Industry Management Committee has indeed been concurrently held by Mayor Wu Guozhen. The government believes that to strengthen the joint distribution mechanism for yarn and cloth, relying solely on the Textile Control Commission and relevant trade associations is not enough. For example, adjusting the electricity consumption of various factories is related to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau. Restoring workers' working hours to pre-war levels is related to society. Therefore, to ensure thorough and effective work, local governments must take more responsibility. Although it is well known that Mayor Wu is busy with official duties, he was still persuaded to take on the chairmanship. He exchanged views with Mayor Wu yesterday afternoon on the issue of stabilizing yarn and cloth prices, and both sides' viewpoints were very consistent. The position of Deputy Chairman of the Textile Control Commission will continue to be held by Li Shengbo concurrently. In addition, Lin Fengbao, Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, has been appointed as a member of the Textile Control Commission. The original Chairman, Shu Yunjhang, resigned from the chairmanship due to his concurrent position as General Manager of the Textile Construction Company and insufficient energy, but he will remain a member. The new chairman and members are expected to take over next week.</p>
<p>Regarding the first joint distribution of cotton yarn, Minister Wang believes it was satisfactory. However, the second joint distribution was not ideal. Minister Wang stated that when he last came to Shanghai, he and various factories agreed that the maximum distribution price for each piece of 20-count yarn should be 1.55 million yuan, and it could only fall within this limit, not exceed it. However, the market price of cotton yarn continued to rise sharply. The reasons for this are indeed higher sales and expensive raw materials, but the yarn factories participating in the joint distribution are also responsible for whether the distribution price is accurate. It is rumored that some yarn factories also operate yarn shops. Therefore, on the one hand, they seem to be losing money due to the distribution of yarn, but on the other hand, they are still making profits through their yarn shops. Such situations must be strictly investigated. The government's principle for joint distribution is to strengthen the mechanism, and the distribution scope is planned to expand from yarn to cloth. The distribution locations are planned to expand from Shanghai to other cities. This is because there is a nationwide shortage of yarn and cloth, so it is necessary to rationalize joint distribution, with the Textile Control Commission presiding over it. Shanghai is the place with the most cotton yarn and cotton cloth production in the country, and most of the yarn and cloth in other places depends on it, so it is hoped that we can start in Shanghai first to stabilize the market prices of yarn and cloth in other cities. Now that Mayor Wu is the chairman of the Textile Control Commission, with the power of the municipal government to assist in suppressing the market prices of yarn and cloth, greater results will certainly be achieved.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the organizational method of the Industry and Commerce Supervision Office, since its passage, is now being actively prepared, and it is expected to be established within this month.</p>
<p>Minister Wang will conclude his official business in Shanghai and return to Beijing by overnight train at 10:00 PM tonight.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Stock Market Spiritless, Hot Stocks with Slight Touches</h3>
<p>The Chinese stock market deteriorated yesterday. Although there was a slight rise at the opening, major investors and new buyers were still absent, so the rise was short-lived, and it soon fell from high to low. Trading in the market was quiet. Only the counters of Yongxin and Xinhe were still lively. Except for slight touches of Xinguangjing, the rest were doubly deserted. Xinhe was fully supplied from number 164, so the chips expanded, almost keeping pace with Yongxin. There was little resistance along the way. The process gradually declined in a calm state. After 11:25, the Northern Group began to buy in at low prices, and Yongxin once pulled up ten yuan from 782 yuan. But it was still very short-lived, and after 11:30, it plunged again. The near-noon prices were all low. New Guang had purchases from the banking sector, so although it fell, it was still stable. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yongxin, Jingfu, Xinguang, Qinheng, and Meiya each fell by one-tenth. Xinhe and Datong fell by a little less than half a percentage point. Among the cold stocks, Tongyi, Zhongfang, underwear, Xinya Company, and China Silk were flat. Rongzheng was up a little less than half a percentage point due to more purchases than sales. The rest all saw small declines. The total turnover was 8.71 million shares. Most of the veteran stocks and off-market stocks fell.</p>
<p>The foreign stock market also replayed its tired state, unable to recover. Except for Jardine Matheson, all stocks fell. Trading was limited. As a result, compared to the previous close, British United Paper and Jardine Matheson each fell by about half a percentage point. Jardine Matheson was flat, and the rest all saw slight declines.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Turns Weak After Textile Construction Company's Distribution</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Textile Construction Company distributed artificial silk to silk weaving factories. Each loom could be allocated about two packages, half a package more than the previous period. Therefore, the black market for artificial silk weakened again yesterday. Number 120, Tianqiao Youguang, was quoted at 4.25 million yuan in the morning, with a maximum of 280,000 yuan, and traded at 4.2 million yuan in the afternoon, which was 150,000 yuan less than the previous day. Miscellaneous brands of Youguang also fell similarly. Semi-gloss goods were relatively scarce and popular, trading for 100,000 yuan. Factory merchants insisted on being bullish. Yesterday, CDE grades were all quoted at 50,000 yuan. Gan Jing's new single five-dan lot was priced at 2.75 million to 800,000 yuan, but there were no transactions. Silk goods were stable, without much change. Huajin crepe was made for 3,300 yuan at the high end, and 3,150 yuan for the second-grade goods.</p>
<h3>Gold Market Buyers Eager, US Dollar Black Market Remains the Same</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Friday was followed by Saturday, and the people were still prosperous. The Guangdong gang forcefully bought, and the market was bullish after being flattened. The morning opened at 2.165 million, and the market was very peaceful at the start, struggling around 2.165 million for a long time. After entering the market, the Guangdong gang bought in, gradually moving upwards. After 10:00, the Central Bank allocated 100 bars at a price of 2.175 million. Although the Central Bank sold off, buyers felt even more eager because the sales to customers were very smooth and retailers still had extravagant hopes. Near noon, it once rebounded to above 2.2 million, hovering around 2.195 million at noon. In the afternoon, it continued to move upward, rebounding to above 2.21 million. As a result, it rose 52,000 yuan compared to the previous close. Ornament gold was listed as high as 2.34 million. Sterling silver and silver dollars remained unchanged. The hidden interest rate was still between 1.5 and 1.8.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies were very firm. Hong Kong stock exchanges fell. The people still tended to buy. Although US dollars were offered at 3,500 yuan for buying, there were still no transactions to be made. In the dark market, about 4,100 yuan to 4,300 yuan, there were slight transactions. As a result, there was not much change compared to the previous close. Hong Kong tickets initially flattened and then firmed up. As a result, they rebounded 20 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong exchange rate was 910 yuan to 930 yuan, Indian exchange rate was 1,120 yuan to 1,140 yuan, and British exchange rate was 14,800 yuan to 15,000 yuan. Transactions were not smooth. The exchange rate of the US currency did not change, and there were still no transactions.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Flat</h3>
<p>The supply and demand of public bonds were relatively balanced yesterday. Transactions were no more than 3 million yuan. The process was very peaceful. The morning opening of the Tongbing bond was 2,050 yuan. The high price was no more than 2,110 yuan. In the middle, it fell to as low as 1,970 yuan. Finally, it struggled at 2,020 yuan. As a result, it fell slightly by 10 yuan compared to the previous close. Grades A, B, D, and E each fell by a small 50 yuan.</p>
<h3>Raw and Refined Sugar Slightly Tight</h3>
<p>The trend of the sugar market was stable yesterday, with not much fluctuation. The guild's listed spot price for number 20 medium sand white sugar was initially 140,500 yuan, and then 140,000 yuan. The price for raw sugar red was 120,500 yuan. Both were slightly tight. The oil gang opened at 113,400 yuan for Huanggang Qing for the brand goods, and 112,000 yuan to 4,000 yuan for ordinary cotton red, totaling about 200 packages. The Guangdong gang opened at 113,000 yuan for 150 packages of light-colored Hainan red, and 100,800 yuan to 5,000 yuan for dozens of packages of Zhu Qing. The Fujian gang opened at 100,800 yuan for Diao Qing.</p>
<h3>The Market for Guest and Lining Yarn Is Weak, Although the Price of Cotton Cloth Has Fallen, the Base Is Still Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market was in a downturn. The news of the registration of stored yarn caused people in the industry to sell, and guest merchants were hesitant to move forward and purchase slightly weakly, resulting in the price falling by 50,000 to 70,000 yuan. However, at the close, some people took advantage of the cheapness to buy, so it returned to a firm position. Yesterday, the market price of 42-count yarn was 3.36 million yuan, which was slightly down by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The price of 20-count heavy-weight Shuangma yarn was 2.22 million yuan, and the price of light-weight yarn was 2.13 to 4 million yuan, which was also slightly down by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. The market prices of other brands of yarn also declined slightly.</p>
<p>The price of cloth was also down by about 1,000 yuan from yesterday. Sales to guest merchants and local streets were few. The industry was cutely informed that Mayor Wu convened a cotton textile industry meeting the day before yesterday and repeatedly enlightened them. Moreover, the previous week's rise had reached its peak. Yesterday, the Textile Construction Company's listed price did not decrease slightly, but the market price of Longtou fine cloth was 90,000 yuan, and then it was traded at 89,000 yuan. The price of Laba Tong fine cloth was 77,000 yuan. General manufacturers were applying for Blue Chicken fine cloth because it was more applicable and had not been sold for a long time. The price opened at 79,000 yuan. Therefore, although the cloth market showed a small decrease, the supply was not smooth and the base was still firm.</p>
<h3>Textile Control Sends Personnel to Review Southern Transport Applications</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Since the Textile Industry Management Committee began handling the registration of manufacturers transporting yarn and cloth to South China a few days ago, as of yesterday, 312 distributors and 107 manufacturers had requested registration forms. Only about ten forms had been completed and submitted, but most did not include supporting documents. According to Liu Wenteng, Director of the Business Office of the Textile Control Commission, the Commission will strictly review the qualifications of the manufacturers to avoid affecting the interests of legitimate manufacturers. The Commission will send personnel to review the registration forms submitted by the manufacturers. During the review, the following points will be noted for factories: 1. Ministry of Economic Affairs factory registration certificate. 2. Municipal Social Affairs Bureau factory registration certificate. 3. Trade Association membership certificate. 4. Capital amount. 5. Date of establishment. 6. Machinery and equipment. 7. Check and sign. 8. Past production volume. For distributors, the following points will be noted: 1. Date of establishment. 2. Capital amount. 3. Business registration certificate. 4. Trade Association membership certificate. 5. Customs registration certificate for exports. 6. Past transportation types and quantities. 7. Check and sign. 8. The situation of affiliated companies in South China. In addition to the staff card and service certificate of the Commission, the foreign investigators of the Commission will also show the dispatch order of the Commission. The review will begin next week.</p>
<h3>Silk Purchase and Sales Committee Established the Day Before Yesterday, Silk Price Issues to Be Decided Next Time</h3>
<p>Regarding the handling of the China Trust Bureau's purchase of raw silk, a purchase and sales committee was jointly organized by the Central Bank, China Silk Company, China Trust Bureau, and Commodity Inspection Bureau. It is learned that the committee was formally established at 3:00 PM on (November 11) at the Central Bank and held its first meeting to discuss the price of D-grade silk and above with 70 evenness. According to the China Trust Bureau's market report to its New York agent, the price of D-grade US silk is $7.50 per pound, with a difference of only $0.25 per grade. Converted into legal tender, it is more than 111,000 yuan per dan, which is too far from the 400,000 yuan increase per grade requested by the manufacturers. For the sake of caution, the committee decided to telegraph New York again to inquire about detailed market conditions before making a decision at the next meeting. However, the price of 3.8 million yuan for D-grade will remain unchanged. The price of each grade above D-grade will still be based on foreign market prices.</p>
<p>The fifth and sixth batches of raw silk purchased by the China Trust Bureau began to be checked yesterday (November 11) and paid today (November 12). The fifth batch was 430 dan, and the sixth batch was 140 dan. Together with the previous four batches of 2,850 dan, a total of 3,420 dan were purchased, worth more than 13 billion. The seventh batch of raw silk has been approved by the China Silk Company, totaling 290 dan. It can be delivered by the company to the China Trust Bureau yesterday. The 4,000 dan of raw silk produced from this year's spring cocoons are expected to be purchased by the end of this month.</p>
<h3>The Price of Sodalin Bleaching Powder and Caustic Soda Is High Due to Shortage</h3>
<p>There has been no new Sodalin from Australia for a long time. Its prices has recently increased dramatically due to strong sales. Between June and July, a 180-pound bag was priced at 180,000 yuan, but the current price has reached 550,000 to 600,000 yuan. Caustic soda, because guest merchants have come to Shanghai to purchase, and printing and dyeing factories in the city cannot do without caustic soda for printing, bleaching, and finishing, all parties are trying to buy as much as possible, resulting in holders waiting for prices to rise. Bleaching powder essence has been imported very little this year, but bleaching powder, the surplus material from the US wartime, once flooded the market, and users were happy to use it because of its low price. Now that the bleaching powder is almost exhausted and the price has also soared, bleaching powder essence has become a rare commodity again. Between February and March of this year, the price per barrel (100 market catties) was 670,000 yuan, but it fell to 110,000 to 20,000 yuan between June and July. At the end of June, when credit was extremely tight, it fell to as low as 90,000 yuan per barrel. Now, Erlitong goods have become valuable and there is no stock. US and Japanese goods, 112 pounds per barrel, are priced at 380,000 to 90,000 yuan, and it is quite difficult to buy spot goods.</p>
<h3>Camel Brand Cigarettes - Factory Price Already Increased - Other Brands Also Raised</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 11th] R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company announced today that, starting October 4th, the price of Camel brand cigarettes will increase by $0.26 per thousand.

Earlier this week, the price of other brands of cigarettes had already increased to $6.50 per thousand.</p>
<h3>Imitation Taiwan Red Tea - Body Too Fine and Crumbly - Difficult to Expand Overseas Sales</h3>
<p>British tea merchants in the foreign tea market absorbed much of the limited supply and few transactions of Keemun tea last year due to scarcity. According to industry insiders, imitation Taiwan fine red tea produced in this city has already been shipped for export by white head firms (tea companies dealing in bulk tea). It is said that while overseas customers are satisfied with the tea liquor, they regret that the tea leaves are too fine and crumbly, which affects something. Domestic sales of green tea in this street's Hakka shops and trading groups remain unchanged. However, Guo Men Hua tea from local tea factories is becoming increasingly active, with top grade fragrant tea already exceeding 50,000 yuan per dan (a unit of weight). Medium grade fragrant tea is following suit, while other teas remain stable.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics Shipped from South Africa - Unloading Yesterday - Besides 5,000 Cases of Cotton Cloth - The Rest Were Woolens and Yarn</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The steamship "Gem-Chys-Weston," managed by the Fook Lai Shipping Company, arrived from South Africa with a large quantity of woolen piece goods, as previously reported. It is now known that the ship is docked at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong and is being unloaded. It has been found that the ship carries a total of over 9,000 tons of goods, of which 5,000 cases are UNRRA cotton cloth, and the rest are woolens and yarn, with no serge. The majority of the woolens are handled by the import department of the "He Yi" foreign firm, and most of the yarn was purchased by "Kai Rui" Yarn Company. The rest of the companies have only small quantities. It is feared that the ship will not be completely unloaded within a week.</p>
<h3>Commodity Tax is a Convenience for Manufacturers - Tax Bureau Affirms</h3>
<p>[Nanjing, 12th, 1:00 PM] Since the Ministry of Finance established new regulations for the collection of commodity tax, industries such as fur, tea, and cement have felt that the burden is too heavy and have submitted documents to relevant central ministries and commissions requesting a reduction. The Tax Bureau now states that the collection of commodity tax was approved by the highest authorities and has gone through legislative procedures. As an administrative agency, the bureau will continue to vigorously promote the tax until further orders are received. Among the commodity taxes, there are not many newly levied taxes, and the tax rates are not high for most categories, except for luxury goods and non-essential items. Foreign goods entering the country are subject to the same commodity tax as domestic goods, in addition to customs duties, to ensure impartiality. The collection of commodity tax is actually a convenience for manufacturers, because after the commodity tax is collected, goods can be transported and sold throughout the country, avoiding various local special product taxes.</p>
<h3>Newspaper Prices Rise by $10 - $84 USD per Ton</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] The U.S. Office of Price Administration today raised the maximum price of newsprint by $10 per ton, but rejected newspaper publishers' request to lift price controls. The maximum price of standard newsprint will now be $84.</p>
<h3>Hongji Coal Already Distributed - White Coal Market Remains Firm</h3>
<p>The Hongji white coal business has been distributed to various businesses by the Coal Business Joint Sales Office, but the market price of Yangquan Jiaozuo white coal lumps in the market remains firm. (Although the amount distributed this time was over 700 tons, there were also 800-900 units in the city's industry, so the average quantity was extremely small. The city's demand for white coal is quite extensive in the winter, and the source is still hopeless, so people's hearts are very strong). White coal dross continues the previous trend, and the market price continues to show resilience. The price of bituminous coal lumps has risen again due to the joint business office's restrictions on industry applications. Only bituminous coal slurry is relatively stable.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Stop Falling and Turn Firm - Oil and Grains Continue to Decline</h3>
<p>After consecutive days of falling rice prices, disputes over origin allocations and applications caused market sentiment to firm in the morning market, calling for a raise of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, but the accumulation of goods in Zhabei and the river downstream is abundant, with more than 200 rice boats and registered customer goods of more than 14,000 shi (a unit of volume). The shop stomach (ability to absorb goods) is not smooth, and the market closes down again, becoming bland. As a result, Japonica rice and Yuan rice are similar, and Indica rice is slightly firmer. In the oil market, with consecutive arrivals of Qingdao raw oil and a small number of arrivals in Hankou and Dalian, raw oil continues to weaken by 1,000 yuan, soybean oil is slightly soft, rapeseed oil is fair, and soybean cake oil head is slightly taken, and the price is flat. The sales of soybeans from various places are stagnant, and there are still sources in the Northeast. The city's electrification is clear, and the Longhai Line can also deliver goods, forming an oversupply, and falling by 300-500 to 1,000 yuan. The source of green beans from various roads continues, and there are not many transactions of high-quality goods. There are no buyers for medium and lower-quality goods, and they are returned to 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and there is still a lack of transactions. Red sorghum is also fatigued by 300-500 yuan, peas are sluggish and fall by 1,000 yuan, the removal of broad beans is reduced, down 1,000 yuan, raw kernels have no up or down for the time being, and lower-quality peanuts are also down by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Sesame seeds are reduced again by 300-500 yuan, black sesame seeds plummet by 10,000 yuan, and bran is firm due to a shortage of goods, red beans have new goods appear for the first time.</p>
<h3>Platinum Price Falls - $75 per Ounce</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 11th] The price of platinum in New York has recently been reduced from a previous price between $85 and $88 to between $85 and $75 per ounce. The re-emergence of this weakness is attributed to speculators selling at a price of $75 per ounce. It has not yet been confirmed how much has been sold at this price. Others are still holding the price of $85, but there are currently few new transactions being made. It is also learned that the jewelry industry currently owns more goods than previously estimated.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics Sales are Booming</h3>
<p>The recent booming sales of woolen fabrics are truly unexpected. For example, fine wool gabardine, serge, Hailing stick, Zhigong, Sezi tribute, Xuanwei flannel, Warden flannel overcoats, plain thick flannel, etc. Although the market price is expensive, there are still many actual transactions every day. Due to the lack of circulation of goods in the market, the desire to order goods is even stronger. Regardless of British goods, American goods, or Hong Kong transshipment goods, people want to order recent goods, because it is intended to meet the market demand and promote them according to current domestic and foreign market prices, and no batch does not make money. Merchants have reduced the deposit for ordering foreign goods from 30-50% to 20% due to the surge in orders, and the pricing is also much more reasonable than two or three months ago.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Longan: According to telegrams from Tong'an yesterday, Tong'an gui (cinnamon) rose another 10,000 yuan, and the Shanghai market has risen by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, which should be considered worthwhile.</p>
<p>Vermicelli: Recently, due to few arrivals, the asking price is tighter, and it has risen again by 20,000 yuan. Superior Longkou vermicelli is 3.78 million yuan, and Qingdao vermicelli is 3.6 million yuan.</p>
<p>Tin Foil: There are few transactions. Shanghai inventory must be subject to commodity tax, so they all go to the production area of Shaoxing to purchase. Since October 1, those exported from the production area have tax bills, and those who hold the tax bills do not need to pay taxes when they arrive in Shanghai. Therefore, the Shaoxing market is lively, and the Shanghai market is quiet.</p>
<p>Hardware: The ironware price increase is in full swing. The market price of Yuan Ding (pig iron) has risen again by more than 10,000 yuan per barrel. Wood screws have been purchased in large quantities by Hakka trading groups, and continue to rise. The inventory of new goods, raw lacquer, is not abundant, and has been searched for in many ways, forming a rare shortage.</p>
<h3>British Goods in Hong Kong - Overwhelming American Goods</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong News] The number of American goods arriving in Hong Kong is gradually decreasing, and there is a tendency to continue to decrease. The recent fall in the US dollar is one proof of this. According to a person in charge of a certain American office, the main reasons why American goods may decrease in Hong Kong are: (1) The route for American goods to Hong Kong is too long, and the cost is relatively high. (2) It is difficult to buy official US dollars, and the black market price is high. Therefore, British goods in the Hong Kong market have gradually overwhelmed American goods, because the United Kingdom, Australia, and India all have goods that the United States can arrive, and the cost is lower than that of American goods. For example, for the same calico, the cost of calico from India is only 1.5 yuan per yard, but it costs 2.5 yuan from the United States. It is profitable to sell Indian cloth for 2 yuan, but it will lose money to sell American goods. Canned goods from Australia have also overwhelmed American goods recently. Therefore, fewer American goods are coming, and the demand for US dollars has decreased, and the market price cannot but fall.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Promotes Normal Education - 500,000 Normal Students to be Added in Five Years</h3>
<p>[Nanjing News] The Ministry of Education has recently started to rectify normal education and has recently issued a five-year normal education implementation plan for various provinces and cities after the war to gradually promote it. It is planned to add 500,000 normal students within five years. According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Education told reporters: The Ministry of Education will have several major reforms in normal education. First, normal education will be established independently in principle. Schools that are jointly established by middle school normal schools should be independently established within a limited time.</p>
<p>Separate Schools for Male and Female Students</p>
<p>Second, emphasize and expand women's normal education, and implement separate schooling for male and female students. If it is unavoidable, classes will be taught separately. Third, normal education will be managed by the government in a unified manner. Normal schools will be run by the province, simple normal schools will be run by the county, and private schools will be transferred to the government or temporarily entrusted to the government. Fourth, special normal subjects will continue to be operated as before, and attention will be paid to cultivating music, art, labor, and other specialized teachers for national education.</p>
<p>Simple Normal Schools Changed to a Three-Year System</p>
<p>Fifth, normal schools may establish simple normal departments or subjects. Simple normal schools must raise the age of students to 15 years or older and change to a three-year system. In the absence of national education teachers, the system of alternating training and practice and the special normal class or simple normal class attached to high schools and junior high schools for one year should be promoted as much as possible, and high school and junior high school graduates should be recruited and given professional normal training. Sixth, the normal education areas divided by the provinces should be adjusted in area, and should not be too large. Each normal education area should have at least two normal schools, each school should have at least 12 classes, and each class should recruit 50 students, at least one of which should be a girls' school. Seventh, each county should establish at least one simple normal school, each school should have at least six classes, and each class should recruit 50 students. If necessary, several counties may jointly establish a school and increase the number of schools and classes year by year according to the needs of teachers.</p>

<p>Civil Affairs Briefs</p>
<h3>Regulations Stipulate that District and Bao Methods Must be Clearly Indicated in Household Registration and Notification Forms</h3>
<p>For the sake of easy distinction of district and bao in the household number column of the household registration book, the Civil Affairs Department has specifically stipulated that the district name abbreviation and bao number should be added between the household number and the number. It also provided detailed explanations for the completion of the resident registration notification form and sent a circular to all district offices for verification and implementation, with the following three points:</p>
<p>(1) It was found that in the household number column of the household registration book, one household was originally designated as one number, with bao as the starting and ending point. However, it was impossible to distinguish which district and bao this number belonged to. It is now stipulated that the district name abbreviation and bao number should be added between the household number and the number, such as "Household Number Pu (2) 98". The character "Pu" refers to Putuo District, (2) refers to the second bao, and 98 is the number, which will be clear at a glance. This wooden stamp will be self-printed by each bao. The district name abbreviations will use the male abbreviations on the National Identification Card.</p>
<p>(2) The household number on the resident registration notification form must clearly indicate the district name abbreviation and bao number, such as: "Pu (2) 98"</p>
<p>(3) Residents listed as migrants in this city on the resident registration notification form refer to those registered in the migration registration book.</p>

<h3>Piercing the Heart with a Single Sword</h3>
<p>— Record of the Recovery of Huaiyin Three-Day Huaiyin Express News Special Correspondent Hang Zhou</p>
<p>The reporter stayed at the adjutant's office of the 74th Division on the night of arrival in Huaiyin. Chief of Staff Wei Zhenyue was very happy to hear of the reporter's arrival and met with me late at night, recounting the recovery of Huaiyin with relish. Early the next morning, the reporter met with Division Commander Zhang Lingfu, a tall man with bright eyes and slightly wavy hair, resembling an American. When he talked about the battle, it made the reporter yearn for the midst of gunfire and bullets.</p>
<p>Every soldier of the 74th Division I met gave me an impression of vigor. From the time of General Wang Yaowu, this unit has had a consistent style, which is strict discipline and treating soldiers like their own children. Therefore, in battle, every soldier is willing to die for the purpose of the war, for their superiors, advancing bravely and without hesitation. Because of the strict discipline, when the people in the recovered area recalled the atrocities of the Communist army, they warmly felt: "These are the people who truly came to liberate us!"</p>
<p>The 74th Division is a reorganized division with a total of three brigades: 51st, 57th, and 58th, known as the "Three Fives." Some people also describe them as follows based on the characteristics of these three brigades: the 51st Brigade is as hard as iron, the 57th Brigade is as fiery as fire, and the 58th is as fierce as a lion. Together, they are "Iron Fire Lion"—three loud words! The task of recovering Huaiyin this time was mainly undertaken by the 58th and 51st Brigades, with the 57th Brigade providing cover.</p>
<p>Straight to the Point</p>
<p>The course of this battle has a somewhat legendary meaning.</p>
<p>In late July, the Seventh Army (not yet reorganized) led by Guangxi General Zhong Ji set out from Guzhen, Anhui, and captured the three cities of Lingbi, Sixian, and Wuhe in one go, opening the door to northern Jiangsu. This can be said to be the prelude to the Battle of Huaiyin. Following this, the army pointed directly east, recovered Siyang on September 14, and immediately crossed the Yunhe River and the old Yellow River to attack Zhongxingji. The Communist army deployed heavy troops on the Si-Huai Highway, preparing for a major battle, but unexpectedly, a surprise force suddenly appeared on its left side.</p>
<p>This surprise force was the 74th Division, which followed the Seventh Army after capturing Suqian. The Communist army, which was known for its intelligence, did not detect it. After the Seventh Army successfully crossed the river, the 74th Division suddenly rushed towards Huaiyin from the southeast of Siyang along the old Si-Huai River with amazing speed, like a shooting star in the middle of the night. When the Communist army received the information, panic had already arisen in its reasoning.</p>
<p>The tactic used by the 74th Division was the famous "Piercing the Heart with a Single Sword," or "Straight to the Point." When Xue Yue, the commander of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, summoned Zhang Lingfu, he said: "This tactic is the first time I have used it. You may be surrounded. Although the mission is difficult, success will be doubled." The sharp "sword" of the 74th Division ultimately obtained that "heart."</p>
<p>The Communist Party had pre-annotated its military failures, saying that it could abandon cities and control rural areas when the situation was unfavorable. But for Huaiyin, a city that served as their political, military, and economic center, Chen Yi, the commander of the New Fourth Army, issued a death order to defend it. Li Yimang, the chairman of the Su-Wan Border Region Government, stated that he would "live and die with Huaiyin." Therefore, the troops it drew from this area were the main force in northern Jiangsu. It was estimated that there were more than 20 regiments, 30,000 to 40,000 people, including the Second Division, Fourth Division, Sixth Division, Fifth Column, Ninth Column, and a brigade that broke through from the Central Plains.</p>
<p>Overcoming All Difficulties</p>
<p>The National Army felt quite depressed in its forced counterattacks on the northern Jiangsu battlefield because the Communist army, like the Ming Dynasty rebel Li Zicheng they admired, was fleeing everywhere, and it was difficult to find the main force. This time they ran into each other, and it was just right! In the past, the Communist army used its main force in battle, such as the Taixing battle. This was the second time. The battle began on September 14 and entered a fierce stage on the 16th. The first place of fierce fighting was Chenjiaji, where there was a Fuyin River. The National Army overcame the stubborn resistance of the Communist army by forcibly crossing the river in the face of the enemy. After crossing the Fuyin River, the battle moved to the suburbs of Huaiyin.</p>
<p>The 17th and 18th were the decisive battles of the main forces. On the 17th, two assault teams of the National Army overcame all difficulties and rushed into the city, which is why it was once rumored that the city had been captured. However, they soon withdrew due to lack of reinforcements. On the 18th, they tried again and made progress of only one li (approximately 0.5 kilometers). The Communist army relied on its large number of troops and stubbornly refused to retreat. The battle was glued together in blood and flesh. Then, the legendary story I want to tell unfolded.</p>
<p>Yang Jin, the battalion commander of the 2nd Battalion of the 172nd Regiment of the 58th Brigade, came from the ranks of a private. He had spent 16 years in the army. Repeated military exploits had led him to rise through the ranks. He had recently been promoted to battalion commander and wanted to make a special performance. At 10:30 PM on the evening of the 18th, the climax of the battle had passed. He had a whim and gathered more than 200 soldiers from the entire battalion, announcing a secret plan. Then, the entire battalion lined up and advanced towards the Communist army's position through the gaps. He took a submachine gun and walked in front, with the soldiers following curiously. Everyone's heart was pounding. But they walked very naturally. Approaching the Communist army's sentry line, a sleepy-eyed New Fourth Army soldier asked: "Which unit are you from?"</p>
<p>"The Fourth Division, relieved from the front," Yang Jin casually replied with the Communist army's designation. In the darkness, it was difficult to see faces clearly. The sentry only saw a series of dark shadows passing by. When they arrived at the second sentry post, the sentry asked as usual: "Password?"</p>
<p>Seeing that the first post had been successfully passed, the soldiers were half as bold and shouted at the top of their lungs: "Damn it, what's with all the questions! We've been fighting all day and haven't rested. What password or no password!" The sentry softened, feeling a moment of doubt, but dared not make a sound.</p>
<p>They continued to pass the third, fourth, ... sentry lines. A few bullets flew sideways, hitting several soldiers. The wounded calmed down, gritted their teeth, and never returned fire. - If they returned fire, they would definitely mess things up - They bravely and cleverly mingled through a total of seven sentry lines. The south gate of Huaiyin was already in front of them. They were so excited that their hearts were about to jump out of their mouths.</p>
<p>General Zhang Lingfu, military commander of the recapture of Huaiyin (Special Correspondent Hang Zhou Post)</p>
<p>The Fire of Victory</p>
<p>It was about 4:00 AM, and the sky was not yet bright. They quickly occupied a stronghold near the city and worked there for 40 minutes, preparing to advance to attack or retreat to defend. They were working nervously, but the Communist army still did not notice. A Communist liaison officer stumbled in front of their fortifications in a daze and was captured. Under interrogation, they learned the Communist army's deployment in the city and knew that there were two ammunition depots at the city gate. At this time, Yang Jin received the order: "Be the first to enter the city!" He ordered the deputy battalion commander to lead half of the soldiers to charge. If they occupied the South City, they would set a fire as a signal.</p>
<p>The charging soldiers set off with submachine guns, machine guns, and small cannons. The guards of the city were caught off guard. In the chaotic battle, the soldiers of Yang's battalion rushed into the city and immediately occupied the ammunition depot, using the Communist army's ammunition to bombard the city in all directions. The Communist army could not figure out how many people had come, and their morale was greatly disrupted.</p>
<p>The fire started - this was the fire of victory ignited by the soldiers of Yang's battalion. Then, the sky also brightened. The National Army from all directions outside the city launched a general attack and entered the city one after another. Fierce street battles unfolded in the streets, on the roofs, in the houses, and in every corner. The Communist army used house-to-house tactics, and almost every house and every wall was contested. From the morning of the 19th to noon, the street battle lasted all day and night. The Communist army left corpses everywhere and finally retreated in defeat.</p>
<p>After Huaiyin City, which had been occupied by the Communist army for a year after Japan's surrender, was recovered, there were two superstitious events: First, on the 19th, the apricot tree in the home of Wang Shicheng behind Li Yimang's mansion blossomed. Apricot blossoms bloom in spring, and now they have bloomed a second time. Wang Shicheng said that he had never seen this in his 70 years of life. I specially went to see it once, and I could still see a few remaining flowers. Coincidentally, the Epiphyllum oxypetalum, which had not bloomed for many years in Yeyuan, the guesthouse used by the Communist Party and now the headquarters of the 74th Division, suddenly appeared like the smile of a young girl on the evening of the 21st. After the calamity, the residents of Huaiyin talked about these two events, citing them as the end of their disaster and a sign of prosperity.</p>
<p>A Scene of Night Flight</p>
<p>In this battle, the Communist army attempted to save its declining position with its main force, but the result was a crushing defeat, with most of the main force being routed. In other words, it had lost three-quarters of the capital it had used to cause trouble in northern Jiangsu. Chen Yi went to Wangying Town north of the city to command for two days, but knowing that the situation was hopeless, he secretly slipped away. Li Yimang shouted "Live and die with the city," but staged a "night flight" on the evening of the 17th. Those who suffered were the scapegoats. Chen Yi, out of shame and anger, shot three regimental commanders who had failed in combat.</p>
<p>The National Army rewarded meritorious service. Yang Jin was promoted from major to lieutenant colonel, and all officers and soldiers of the entire battalion were promoted one rank.</p>
<p>The defeated Communist army retreated towards Huai'an and Lianshui. In order to block the pursuit of the National Army, it resorted to extremely inhuman and vicious methods, breaching the Yunhe River dike in four places. The torrents surged south, turning a 200-li area into a swamp. When I arrived in Huaiyin, the streets were still flooded. I went to inspect the breached places, each of which was 50 meters long. But the water, in addition to causing more damage to the common people, could not stop the advance of the National Army, which was rescuing the people from the water and fire. While the National Army was trying to block the breaches, it detoured and pursued the enemy. The 57th Brigade entered Huai'an on the evening of the 21st, clearing out the Communist army and recovering the city.</p>
<p>In addition to the engineers, local people also participated in the breach-blocking and dike-restoration project. Wang Shuming, a 79-year-old man who was familiar with this work, was invited by the local people to guide and supervise the work. By September 29, all four breaches had been blocked. Now the water is slowly receding, but the hatred left by the Communist army has no way to disappear from the hearts of the people!</p>
<h3>Clearing the Countryside and Recovery</h3>
<p>— Baoding News, September 12 Our Special Reporter Yang Bingsen</p>
<p>Hebei Province has suddenly shown a new face this month, that is, the smooth development of the province's work of clearing the countryside. Since the beginning of the month, it was first launched in the eastern part of Hebei and Pingdong. In a short period of ten days, it has achieved significant results, but this has further increased the burden on the province's administrative capacity. The Hebei Provincial Government and all units are making every effort to explore all measures related to development. At the same time, with the expansion of the recovered areas, various difficulties have arisen. Therefore, the reporter will report to the readers the details of Hebei's countryside clearing work and the various new measures taken after the recovery.</p>
<p>The Provincial Government's Predicament Before Clearing the Countryside First, let's take a look at the current financial situation in Hebei Province. This year, the province's expenses approved by the Central Government are 5.2 billion yuan. By the end of June, 6.2 billion yuan had already been spent, exceeding the planned expenses for the whole year by 1 billion yuan. The Central Government allocated 700 million yuan in July and 1.2 billion yuan in August, but nothing has been settled in September. The entire financial source has no way to open, and there is no way to reduce expenditure. It can be said that it has reached the end of the road. This is the situation of the entire financial situation of Hebei Province. Let's take another look at the collection of field tax and in-kind, which is closely related to finance. It is expected that the possible collection this year will be 84 million catties. However, because wheat is generally infected with jaundice in central and southern Hebei, coupled with floods, natural disasters, and man-made disasters, the wheat production this year is not high. As of now, more than 6 million catties have been collected. If all 132 counties in the province can be recovered, it is estimated that 1.1 billion catties can be collected, which is a huge difference. The biggest reason for these two items is undoubtedly entirely related to security. Before the launch of the countryside clearing work, only 42 counties in the province had been recovered, less than one-third of the total number of counties in the province. Among them, there was not a single complete county, and only 14 counties had established governance in the county towns. Therefore, all administrative functions could not be implemented, and of course, there was no source of finance. All administrative expenditures still had to be handled, resulting in the entire provincial administration being in a difficult situation, and administrative efficiency also became a "drag."</p>
<p>The Smooth Development of Clearing the Countryside Since the launch of the countryside clearing work in Hebei Province, the implementation has been extremely smooth. Up to now, 11 counties in the eastern part of Hebei and Pingdong have been recovered one after another, including Leting, Yutian, Lulong, Zunhua, Xinglong, Baodi, Sanhe, Xianghe, Jixian, Qian'an, and Pinggu, and two counties in central Hebei, Rongcheng, and southern Hebei, Zhaoxian. At the same time, the Baoding area and the Shijiazhuang area also followed the mobilization in northern Hebei, and the security circle is expanding day by day. Although it has only been more than ten days, the provincial government's administration has controlled 60 counties, and the development of Hebei Province's administration is highly anticipated.</p>
<p>The administrative work in coordination with the military development has also been handled very appropriately by the provincial authorities. Military and administrative coordination is promoted as a whole. After a county town is recovered, the county magistrate immediately sets up the county government sign and implements appeasement and training work. Even the township and baojia chiefs of each county are designated in advance and advance with the army. When they arrive in their respective county borders, they take charge of village administration. At the same time, the home returning teams of each county are all enthusiastic and desperately assisting administrative rehabilitation. Sun Zhenbang, the director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Hebei Provincial Government, also rushed to the front line to supervise the launch of political work.</p>
<p>In order to take into account the entire rehabilitation work, the provincial government also ordered all county magistrates in the province to enter the county and assist refugees in returning home. It also held an administrative commissioner conference to discuss urgent administrative measures during the rehabilitation period and stipulated the allocation of 2.5 million yuan in rehabilitation funds for first- and second-class counties and 2 million yuan for third-class counties.</p>
<p>The Most Important Work is Relief for Refugees</p>
<p>First, let's take a look at the current disaster situation and relief work in Hebei. A total of 25 counties in Hebei Province suffered from floods this year, with 1.2 million victims. There are also 263,000 refugees, 35,558 home returning teams, 112,000 victims of wind, hail, and drought disasters, 33,000 young people out of school, 57,400 unemployed people, and 28,500 extremely poor people. The relief sub-office surveyed 313,000 people. In the newly recovered 11 counties in eastern Hebei, it is estimated that there may be at least 110,000 new refugees. Calculating the 79 counties that have not yet been recovered, there are approximately 790,000 refugees (statistics from the Hebei Provincial Social Affairs Department). From this figure, it can be seen that if all the provinces are recovered, it can add 900,000 refugees. Therefore, this winter, the entire province is expected to have more than 2.8 million refugees of all types waiting for relief.</p>
<p>Let's take another look at the current relief work in Hebei Province. This year, the Central Government allocated 8,000 tons of relief grain and 10 million yuan in relief funds to the province. The province raised 30 million yuan, of which 20 million yuan was allocated for accommodating refugees and handling earthquake relief in Changli and other counties. As for the grain paid by the Central Government, because it was stored in warehouses taken over from the enemy and puppet regimes, half of it was actually moldy and rotten, and half of it was usable. As of now, the relief work handled with the above grain and relief funds has included providing relief to 264,432 people, including those who were struggled against by the Communist army, refugees, home returning teams, volunteer strong men's teams, out-of-school and unemployed youth, and general refugees. Currently, only 600 tons of miscellaneous grains remain. Using this number to provide relief to more than 2.8 million refugees is a drop in the bucket, with a huge difference.</p>
<p>The relief work for the 900,000 refugees who may be generated after the recovery has become a serious and urgent current problem, and it is also the most important work of clearing the countryside and recovering. Therefore, the provincial government decided to request the following minimum relief figures from the central ministries and commissions and the Four Joint Offices, including emergency agricultural loans of 2.88 billion yuan for rural revival, ordinary agricultural loans of 7.2354 billion yuan, and long-term relief funds of 28.5 billion yuan, totaling 30.9654 billion yuan. Sun Lianzhong, Chairman of Hebei, also sent Qu Linghan, Director of the Social Affairs Department of the Provincial Government, along with four refugee representatives from various regions to Beijing at the beginning of next month to petition. Everyone in the area controlled by the Communist Party knows that they have implemented a policy of struggle and liquidation. Some of the people's land has been distributed, and some has been forced to sell. Once it is recovered, disputes over small land plots will inevitably arise. In order to take this into account, the provincial government specially formulated the main points for handling land in the recovered areas, the content of which is: (1) Restore the ownership of the original landlords, and the right to use the land will still be temporarily in the hands of the people who are cultivating it. (2) For land sold under pressure, the original landlord may submit proof to request the administrative agency to assess the price and recover the ownership of the land, and the right to use the land will still be temporarily in the hands of the people who are currently cultivating it. . In addition to restoring ownership, the land of self-cultivating farmers that has been illegally distributed or sold will be given priority in restoring the right to use it. (4) The administrative authorities stipulate the maximum and minimum amount of all land and land used by self-cultivating farmers. (5) The administrative agencies stipulate that the land rent standard should be below 37.5%.</p>
<p>In addition, the provincial government plans to establish land administration review committees in various counties and cities in the near future to thoroughly reorganize land registration and land rights work, so as to fully resolve land-related matters.</p>
<h3>General Li Tianxia's Demeanor</h3>
<p>At a certain banquet, this reporter had the first opportunity to meet General Li Tianxia, commander of the 83rd Division, formerly the commander of the 100th Army before the reorganization.</p>
<p>His refined diction, humble attitude, and a democratic, artistic demeanor left a deep impression on this reporter.</p>
<p>The division commander is from Baoshan County, Jiangsu, and speaks a Pudong dialect, slightly tinged with a northern accent. He is not particularly tall, but he exudes a youthful vigor and the spirit of a veteran fighter. At the same time, due to his hometown being by the sea and the river, he possesses a passionate and aspiring heart.</p>
<p>From the division commander's conversation, we learned that his talents and hobbies are multifaceted. When we visited the division headquarters daily to gather war news, we often heard a quiet melody drifting in the wind; that was the division commander taking a stroll with his soul. It is said that his favorite song is "Truth, Goodness, and Beauty." As far as this reporter knows, the division's band is equipped with unparalleled completeness and talent compared to any other unit. They not only play music but also compose it. The "Holy War March" and "Victory Fantasia" that this reporter had heard in the past were their creations commemorating the great victory in Western Hunan.</p>
<p>In the past, the division commander often wrote plays, but recently, due to military affairs, he no longer indulges in this pursuit. However, he still actively promotes it. Regarding the "Wedding March" recently performed by the division's political department at the Tai County military-civilian gala, regardless of the scenery, lighting, or acting, it was perfect and extremely skillful. The division commander himself also said, "The performance this time might not be considered particularly brilliant due to the hasty preparations; however, I believe that even as it is, it is a groundbreaking endeavor in northern Jiangsu." This public performance lasted for five consecutive days, and the division commander personally attended every performance until the end. This fact demonstrates how much the division commander loves art and how he leads people to pursue new aspirations!</p>
<p>The division commander's talent extends to his eloquence. At every gathering, it never feels complete without his speech. Once the division commander participates in an assembly, people's attention naturally focuses on the platform, listening to his uninterrupted eloquence. It adds endless vitality to the venue. Not only is it true of his speeches, but in ordinary interactions or conversations, the division commander's vocabulary towards others is always so warm and frank. Based on this alone, he firmly grasps the hearts of his tens of thousands of subordinates, inspiring them to sacrifice for the country and for him, to fight and win battles.</p>
<p>His attitude towards his subordinates is completely democratic, without the slightest pretense of being a "division commander" or a "lieutenant general." After finishing his work, he often drives a Jeep himself to inspect and observe the lives of each of his subordinates. There is a specially established Sun Yat-sen Club in the division headquarters, which is a spiritual resting place for every comrade in the 83rd Division and a place where their lives are entrusted. Here, there is all kinds of noble entertainment, such as movies, musical instruments, chess, and ball games. The division commander and soldiers play together here. He once told the soldiers: "When entertaining, if I arrive, you don't have to stand up or salute. If you want to express your welcome to my participation, then you can clap your hands." This was told to me by a comrade Zhang from the political department with excitement and pride. He also said, "Our division commander's American style is really something."</p>
<p>The division commander is a soldier of the times, constantly advancing with the changes of the times. In his spare time, reading books and newspapers is his only homework. For example, he almost always reads every piece of reporting on northern Jiangsu disclosed in the newspapers of Beijing and Shanghai. In the evening, you might see his footprints in the branch offices along Zhongshan Road in Tai County, where he lingers in front of the glass windows, seeking his spiritual nourishment. Because his memory is particularly strong, he reads very quickly. It is said that once, when his wife was surprised that he had read several books in one night, he calmly and methodically summarized the contents of the books. One day, a certain person from the military law department of the division headquarters joked to the reporters: "In front of our division commander, we would never dare to cheat, no matter what. Because if we report a very long number with a slight error twice, the division commander will immediately point it out to us. Do you think we would still talk about cheating?" The division commander has a great interest in economics. He often says: "Everything in the world is completely built on numbers." Perhaps this is the reason for his excellent memory today.</p>
<p>He cares about every one of his subordinates, and he also cares about the youth and students in society. When Weishui Bridge Elementary School in Tai County was restored after the war, because the school building was destroyed by the puppet army and was unusable, a variety show was launched to raise money for repairs. At this time, in addition to providing spiritual support, the division commander also had his beloved band participate in the performance. He also provided assistance from other aspects.</p>
<p>In May and June, the elementary school teachers in Tai County went on strike because their treatment was meager and insufficient to live on. The division commander also joined forces with all walks of life to launch a campaign to respect teachers, making various plans, working hard, and finally completing the matter with great perseverance and enthusiasm, so that the music of Tai County would not be interrupted.</p>
<p>Even recently, the division commander has made great efforts to appeal to relevant parties regarding the matter of establishing a provincial secondary school in Tai County. In addition, regarding the training of refugee youths, the division commander always handles and sponsors it with a compassionate heart.</p>
<p>The division commander is a former subordinate of General Wang Yaowu. He is only forty years old this year, and he is considered a young man among the generals. Because he is young, he has courage and determination. In the fierce battles in Western Hunan and Northern Hunan, he revealed a new spirit, inflicting unprecedented blows on the enemy and supporting the entire battle situation. After the end of the war, in the statistics of the military commission's issued military merit certificates, out of a total of 107, the troops he led obtained 14, including the very first one (No. 1) and the last one (No. 107). After the victory, he led the brave soldiers of the 100th Army to cross the river to maintain stability. He dispersed the armed forces of the puppet army with swift skill and smoothly completed the work of accepting surrender and sending away prisoners. Just as he was preparing to advance, the cease-fire order was suddenly issued, and the planned plan could not be carried out. Afterwards, when talking about this matter, he always had a feeling of regret. He has always been optimistic about the battle situation in northern Jiangsu. He once said boldly: "The national army is not unwilling to fight the Communist Party, but to maintain the vitality of the entire Chinese nation. If we want to fight, I dare say that the 100th Army can be stationed in Huaiyin and Nian in four hours." Later, facts finally proved the accuracy of this statement.</p>
<p>In July, the Communist army frantically launched an offensive in northern Jiangsu. They thought that the national army's slow advancement in compliance with the government's consistent intention to be tolerant for the sake of the country was a sign of weakness. They wanted to test what kind of army the 100th Army really was. The Battle of Taixing told the Communist Party, which believed in force first, that the brilliant victories on the banks of the Xiang River and the Xuefeng Mountains were not accidental. At the same time, on the other hand, it strengthened the conviction of the people of Tai County: "With our Division Commander Li and the 100th Army (to this day, the people of Tai County still habitually call them that), we are not afraid."</p>
<p>Due to strategic reasons, in mid-August, the news came that the 83rd Division would be transferred to southern Jiangsu. All sectors of Tai County sent telegrams to plead for them to stay, but it was ineffective. In order to leave a souvenir, one afternoon, all sectors held a farewell party at the Continental Hotel. Before the meal, the division commander told the reporters: "I feel that the current situation is even more complicated than during the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance; therefore, our responsibilities are even greater and more arduous than during the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance. At this time and place, I don't think anyone can steal peace and enjoy themselves. Everyone should recognize their own position and take on their responsibilities." At the dinner, he gave an impromptu speech, "Our division has been stationed in northern Jiangsu for eight months. During this period, we have received a great deal of assistance from all sectors in all aspects. I would like to express my sincere gratitude. However, I am very ashamed that due to the government's repeated tolerance of the Communist Party, we were unable to make a large-scale advance to achieve everyone's wishes, which is a regrettable thing. Now that we are about to leave, I feel a variety of emotions. What we can all feel together is that the feelings between our division and the people of Tai County will never be hindered by the obstruction of the mountains and clouds. We still need to encourage each other and strive to complete our tasks." Talking and laughing freely, drinking to their hearts' content, until the night was late before they dispersed. It seemed that heaven followed people's wishes. The next day, the battle situation suddenly became tense, and the 83rd Division was ordered to remain in its original defense to deal with the sudden change in the situation, so it conveniently left Division Commander Li to the people of Tai County. However, after only a few days, Division Commander Li finally left Tai County and was transferred to Taixing amid a reluctance. Of course, we believe that the distance of dozens of miles cannot dilute the warm feelings between each other. The 1.2 million people of Tai County will eternally remember their Division Commander Li and the 100th Army, and wish him and them success. Look, do the people coming and going on Zhongshan Road not often point to the photo of the chairman and the division commander displayed in the glass window of Datong Bookstore?</p>
<p>When the division commander first arrived in Tai County, he said at the welcome meeting of all sectors: "We are very willing to cooperate with all sectors to work hard for national construction; we are even more willing to accept the guidance and criticism of the 'rural gentlemen' so that our 100th Army will always be an army of the times." Indeed, with the exchange of sympathy and responsibility, the people of Tai County and the 83rd Division have become one in eight months.</p>
<p>"The timing of heaven is not as good as the advantage of the terrain, and the advantage of the terrain is not as good as the harmony of the people." At this epoch-making transformation, and facing this fragmented northern Jiangsu, we expect General Li to further develop his superior talents and use this vibrant and active unit - the 83rd Division - to bring light back to the entire northern Jiangsu.</p>

<h3>New Autumn on the Banks of Poyang Lake</h3>
<p>— Wuyuan, September 15th, this newspaper's reporter Yu Ning</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Dafu described the scenery of the Fuchun River extraordinarily beautifully ten years ago. At that time, some people said that he had a kind of local sentimentality at work. Now, if this writer writes this article about Poyang Lake, will someone make such a misunderstanding? In fact, it is not so. However, this writer's hometown is located in the upper reaches of Poyang Lake, adjacent to Fuliang, Leping, and Dexing, all belonging to the fifth administrative region of Jiangxi, so it has a bit of the atmosphere of Poyang Lake. Poyang Lake is one of the five largest lakes in our country. Dongting Lake is located in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, Taihu Lake is located in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and Poyang Lake is located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. It flows into the Yangtze River from the lake mouth. It is formed by the confluence of the Chang River, the Xin River, and the Po River. From Leping, Fuliang, and Yingtan in the upper reaches to Wucheng, Nanchang, Xingzi, Duchang, and Hukou in the lower reaches, it spans more than 300 miles. Most of the counties along the lake are purely agricultural areas with abundant products. Most of the residents of each village, except for a few who do business, live the lives of farmers. The natural superior environment gives them extremely fertile land, allowing them to cultivate their own fields in peace. The lake water brings them a comfortable and leisurely life, and the calm and mirror-like green autumn scenery naturally sets off a beautiful and magnificent picture. The vast land on the banks of Poyang Lake is widely planted with major native products and miscellaneous grains, such as Dexing's tea, rice, sugarcane, and paper; Leping's rapeseed oil, rice and wheat, broad beans, soybeans, peanuts, indigo, sugar, radishes, ramie, coal; Fuliang's black tea porcelain; Poyang's tobacco leaves, lotus seeds, rice, miscellaneous grains; melon seeds, peanuts; Wannian's rice, indigo; Duchang's rice, tobacco. This year, the early and late rice crops in all the counties along the lake have a 100% harvest. Other products have also been widely harvested, and the prosperous and peaceful years of well-being have finally reached their goal this year. To add icing to the cake, prices are still rising and cannot fall. If we calculate the total value of agricultural production in each county around the lake throughout the year, the magnitude of the material power is already amazing.</p>
<p>Four Major Needs</p>
<p>The farmers on the shores of the lake live by being diligent and hardworking. They support themselves with blood and sweat. They are producers, not consumers. The extravagant atmosphere of urban material civilization has not yet spread to the countryside, and they still maintain a pure and simple style. Their clothes are mostly cotton fabrics. Because cotton is abundant in the lake area, some people have said: The status of cotton production here is not lower than that of kerosene, steel, or rice. From this statement, we can understand the abundance of cotton production here. Therefore, in the rural areas around the lake, women almost all spin cotton as their main job. Every family has two or three hand-cranked spinning wheels made of bamboo strips. They tirelessly spin and weave from morning to night, using their own cotton to make yarn, and then weaving the yarn into cloth. They don't need to buy expensive cloth in cloth shops to wear. They have already solved the problem of clothing. The problem of food is even more substantial than clothing. Such as rice, oil, beans, millet, wheat, wine, vegetables, sugar, tobacco, pork, beef, mutton, chicken, duck, goose eggs, etc. needed for daily household use, they not only eat as much as they can, but also sell a large surplus every year. The only thing they need to buy from outside is salt. Therefore, there is no need to solve the problem of food. As for housing, although foreign buildings and mansions are rare, there is no shortage of earthen houses, plank houses, bamboo fences, and thatched cottages. Some households are close together, and some are sparsely arranged. The wood for construction is mostly taken from Dexing and Wuyuan counties because there are no trees along the lake. In recent years, new buildings have been built everywhere more vigorously than before the war. Not only are they just to shield from the wind and rain, but also to provide shelter from the elements. In terms of travel, there are cars on land and boats on water. They don't need to miss the four major needs of life, namely food, clothing, shelter, and transportation, and they have long put them behind them.</p>
<p>Dawn and fog, dusk and vastness, cattle and sheep lie and walk along the lake, in groups of hundreds and thousands, children and farmers play with calves, vast trees and low sky, this is the scenery that is always available by the lake. The flowers of the moon are sparse, and the red reeds and geese are startled by the cold. The fishing songs on moonlit nights and the cool breeze blowing on the face have already revealed the bleakness of the new autumn. The products of the rural areas by the lake are mostly harvested at this time. Spring bloom and autumn harvest, this is the right time. Let's take a look at the silver lake and the bright moonlight for thousands of miles. Let's listen to the sound of rice threshing by the lake and listen to the fishing songs sent by the lake wind, and the shadows of the sails carrying the blood and sweat of the rural products. Poyang Lake, which is 300 miles wide! You deeply surround countless self-reliant and simple men, loving each other, how can people not envy you?</p>
<p>Huaiyin South Gate was renamed "Lihua Gate" in memory of the 57th Brigade of the 74th Division, which was the first to enter with the number "Lihua". This newspaper's special correspondent (5th from the left) and Brigade Commander Lu Xing (6th from the left) and Battalion Commander Yang Jing (2nd from the right) took a photo for memory. (Special Correspondent Hang Zhou sent) The Guangzhou Municipal Government is committed to rectifying the city appearance.</p>
<h3>Lingnan Municipal Administration</h3>
<p>— Guangzhou Air News, 6th, Special Correspondent Liang Feng</p>
<p>Most attentive to. The first move after Mayor Ouyang took office was to prohibit all street vendors from selling, although the fact that vendors could not make a living after being banned was another matter, but at least the streets were much cleaner! Also, in order to rectify the city's appearance, all the refugees left in the city were sent to the suburbs, asking them to return to their hometowns to make a living, so as not to tarnish the city's appearance here. This was originally a good method of "If there is a famine in Henan, move its people to Hedong, and if there is a famine in Hedong, do the same." However, at present, rural areas are bankrupt, and it is not easy for refugees to find food when they return to their hometowns. Therefore, when "both Henan and Hedong are experiencing famine," this method seems to be unworkable. It is said that many refugees sneaked back to Guangzhou on foot after being sent away, probably because they all knew that it was easier to beg for food in the city!</p>
<p>There are approximately a thousand refugees who have not yet been sent away. Autumn is not very severe, and in the Central News Agency's epidemic diary, the burial team only recovers more than a dozen corpses that die on the streets every day; however, after autumn, the refugees will be ragged and sleep on the streets, suffering from hunger and cold. If the authorities are unable to provide relief, the tragic situation is truly unimaginable. The refugees have long issued appeals, pleading with the authorities to find ways to strengthen relief efforts. However, the reply from the relief authorities is the officialdom's polite phrase of "allowance for consideration." Therefore, in the past few days, more than a dozen refugees have petitioned, even angrily removing the signboard of the Guangzhou District Working Team of the Good Rescue Branch. More than a thousand overseas Chinese waiting for ships to leave the country are also roaring, and a large number of unemployed officers are also without food and clothing, running around and calling for help, requesting that they be taken in. These events are enough to show a glimpse of social unrest!</p>
<p>However, Guangzhou also has its "prosperous" side. If you walk to the Bund and Hanmin Road, the neon lights of those "so-and-so large restaurants" will shine so brightly that you will feel dizzy; the charming and attentive attitude of the charming waitresses in the restaurants will make you lose your mind; many dignitaries, wealthy merchants, and young masters are bowing to them under their skirts, spending hundreds of thousands of gold, and will not be stingy at all; and in a certain two major restaurants in Xiguan, there are even so-called singing girls serving wine, which is an even more beautiful scene, and there is no end to it. If you are in the Xihakou area of the Bund, there are also many "smuggling" Guangzhou girls, who gather in groups of three or five on the streets and throw flirtatious glances at you. If you are interested, they will take you to their "base"—a hotel—and you can indulge yourself for only ten to twenty thousand yuan; also, the "flower boat" on the East Bund is also a world of its own; although prostitution is prohibited in Guangzhou, some people estimate that there are more than 20,000 women in the city who are engaged in the flesh trade, which is probably another social problem!</p>
<p>Due to these various phenomena of social unrest, newspaper reporters often report on social news, which often involves municipal measures, thus arousing the dissatisfaction of the municipal authorities with newspaper reporters. The municipal government initially wanted to control the news and strictly prohibit various units from releasing information, which aroused the resentment of reporters throughout the city. As a result, few people attended Mayor Ouyang's reception for reporters, and things only calmed down after several explanations. However, the newspaper reporters just happened to be "unwilling to accept favors" and have recently continued to report or criticize the weaknesses of the municipal administration, which made the authorities have to show them some color! Therefore, recently, one daily newspaper and one evening newspaper were fined for simultaneously reprinting an article from the supplement of the Nanjing Xinmin Daily, and were ordered to stop publication for one day. There was also a small daily newspaper that was ordered to stop publication, allegedly because it published a piece of news exposing corruption, which angered the authorities and was used as a reason to stop its publication. In fact, the municipal authorities, of course, also have many difficulties; regarding the difficulties of municipal implementation, Mayor Ouyang has reported very thoroughly at the provincial administrative meeting. The most important thing, of course, is the lack of funding. He also talked about the situation of municipal construction before the war and the situation of destruction after the war, and the last sentence was also because of the lack of funding; he specifically pointed out that the central government only subsidized 50 million yuan in reconstruction funds twice, which was not enough to repair the roads alone, and it was even more impossible to talk about other things! Therefore, it is difficult for a clever woman to cook without rice. Although the municipal government's tax revenue is increasing every month, it was more than 50 million yuan in August and more than 69 million yuan in September, an increase of more than 10 million yuan, but it is feared that apart from being able to improve the treatment of municipal government officials in the past few months, there will be little left for other construction projects!</p>
<p>In the recovery of Huaiyin and other countries, the transportation of the national army relied mainly on ox carts, except for a few artisanal tools. (Photo by Central News Agency)</p>

<p>Xia Zhibing, Ying Shijie, and Ji Ruolan were classmates. Xia Zhibing was deeply in love with his cousin, Ruolan. However, Ruolan married Shijie. From then on, Zhibing fought against the Japanese in the Northeast. Shijie, relying on his business acumen, became one of the high-society Chinese celebrities in Shanghai's foreign concessions, while Ruolan led a fulfilling life as a virtuous wife and loving mother.</p>
<p>When the "1931" War of Resistance began, Zhibing suddenly came to Shijie's house. He urged Shijie to donate his wealth to the war effort and also persuaded him to move his factory in the Shanghai concessions to the interior, to strengthen the rear's production capacity. However, Shijie did not accept Zhibing's advice and secretly went to Hong Kong to live a life of leisure. Zhibing felt extremely disappointed in Shijie's cowardice and greed. However, he also met a group of passionate friends, who were representatives of the workers who came to petition.</p>
<p>In December of that year, the National Revolutionary Army in Shanghai retreated westward, and the concessions became isolated islands. Zhibing and his comrades, who had shared hardships, lived in seclusion in the home of A'Fa in the slum area of western Shanghai, continuing their underground work.</p>
<p>Shijie and Ruolan returned from Hong Kong. Ruolan found out Zhibing's address and came to visit him in this humble abode. When she saw the impoverished lives of Zhibing and his friends, she did not understand what force was sustaining their spirits. Lao Zhang, together with the intellectual youth Xiao Lu, felt indignant about the major demonstration the enemy was planning on Nanjing Road. After discussing it, they secretly each took a grenade and left.</p>
<p>Shijie was preparing to resume production at his factory. A'Fa was not satisfied with merely resolving his own unemployment problem. He wanted to persuade Shijie again to move the factory to the interior via Hong Kong. This request was still rejected. Furthermore, due to differing views on the War of Resistance, A'Fa exposed Shijie's secret dealings of supplying the enemy with hemp sacks. Ruolan felt very hurt because of this, as she also began to realize Shijie's contemptibility.</p>
<p>A'Long came and witnessed the scene of Lao Zhang throwing a grenade at the enemy at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yinhua Street, sacrificing himself for his country. Everyone mourned Lao Zhang. Xiao Lu also returned, admitting that he had become cowardly at the critical moment, causing Lao Zhang to bravely sacrifice himself. Everyone thought that Xiao Lu was the youngest, had not succeeded in his studies, and had not mastered swordsmanship, so it would be better for him to go to the rear for further education. So, everyone gathered their last bit of money to give him travel expenses to go to the interior via Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The Mickey Mouse Ballroom was a gathering place for Shanghai's nouveau riche and social climbers. That night, Zhibing also became a guest. This was also a place where Shijie and Ruolan often came, so Zhibing also met them there. A'Liang, a worker who had sold his soul, now appeared as a nouveau riche. The time that Zhibing and A'Fa had planned to eliminate A'Liang was approaching, but they also had to deal with Ruolan's conversation. When the ballroom reached the point of performing a special Conga dance, all the lights in the ballroom suddenly went out, and gunshots rang out. In the chaos, Ruolan saw A'Fa calmly leaving the ballroom. Zhibing watched A'Fa leave and then deeply breathed a sigh of relief, secretly instructing Ruolan not to make a scene. From then on, Ruolan fully understood Zhibing's work, but she was also worried about Shijie's reckless behavior. Shijie had a conflict of interest with a major traitor, and that traitor threatened to harm him. So, he wanted to go to Hong Kong to temporarily avoid the danger, but the traitor's persecution did not let up on Shijie. As soon as Shijie's car left the gate, he died in a hail of gunfire.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Pacific War, Xiao Lu, whose will was not firm, constantly wavered between man and mouse, and finally, under the lure of great profit, he betrayed Zhibing. Zhibing and A'Fa were arrested at the same time but in different locations. Xiao Lu also did not escape the enemy's clutches and was killed by the enemy. At the same time, following a check as a clue, Ruolan was also arrested one night. The enemy wanted to use her to soften Zhibing and gave them both a chance to talk alone. Zhibing and Ruolan knew his tricks, so they took advantage of this opportunity to talk about their own affairs. Due to the retelling of past events, Ruolan revealed the secret in Zhibing's heart. The feelings that he had suppressed for so many years, he had always played the role of Cyrano in love. Dawn broke! They faced the morning sun, following A'Fa's bloody footprints, sacrificing their lives to fulfill their responsibility as human beings.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Dare-to-Die Commando</h3>
<p>— A Screenwriter's Thoughts, Kou Jiabi</p>
<p>In recent days, many friends have asked me to write something about "Dare-to-Die Commando." Director Tang Xiaodan also wants to make a big splash. This has evoked many memories—</p>
<p>In July of the thirty-third year [1944], the China Film Studio used the Lend-Lease Act to obtain a large batch of materials from the United States. Due to the inconvenience of international transportation, it took nearly three years on the road. If the material was not used immediately, all the film would be destroyed. At that time, Director Xiaodan brought a short text of several hundred words, which was neither an outline nor a story. It could only be said to be an incomplete idea, and he wanted me to turn it into a complete film script of more than one hundred pages.</p>
<p>Writing a film script is not like writing poetry, novels, or plays, because it is not only purely literary but also closely related to modern science. One must be familiar with mechanical and filming techniques to write a script that is applicable. I myself am a layman when it comes to film and really dare not accept. After Director Xiaodan's repeated persuasion and encouragement, I reluctantly made a bold attempt.</p>
<p>I felt enormous difficulty in handling this subject matter. The person in charge specified that the theme of the film was to praise the protagonist, Zhou Mengli, as a modern new policeman whose true spirit was to serve the people, the police being the nanny of the people. But the public's impression of the police was that they only knew how to cause trouble, extort money, and bully the common people, being ruthless wolves. If this was filmed, the audience would not enter the theater and it would only be shown to ourselves.</p>
<p>At that time, the country was resisting the war, society was progressing, and the system was reforming. So, we could use the differences between the new and old police, what the new police's spirit of service was, and what the bad habits of the old police were, to make the public understand the duties of the police as the theme of the film. Why not try it?</p>
<p>In the sweltering summer, sitting in a small room, I rushed day and night. In half a month, the first draft of the scene division was completed. Director Xiaodan took it to the Central Police Academy and several experts to study. The result was that the shortcomings of the old police were not allowed to be exposed, so as not to cause disputes. However, without Qin Hui's treachery, how can Yue Fei's loyalty be shown! At that time, I could not get out of the job, and I felt great pain in my spirit. But there were many people who thought this was a good stepping stone to promotion and wealth, like a group of stinky flies, pulling out many unnecessary personnel matters.</p>
<p>Every play must have its dramatic quality; otherwise, it cannot become a play. The main scene of "Ode to the Police Soul" was in an irrefutable joint trial, which was the entire "climax." It was what I spent the most effort writing, what the director wanted to film, what the actors wanted to act, and what the audience wanted to see. Just as we were filming here, the film ran out.</p>
<p>At that time, because of the obstruction of international transportation, there was a shortage of film. The studio limited each film to 18,000 feet. The first part of the police academy that is now showing was not written by me; it was the director's introduction. Because there was too much foreshadowing in the front, it affected the lack of film in the back. In order to complete the work, the director deleted most of the main scene and moved the climax to the back, a full-scale fight to destroy enemy spies. This diluted the original theme. In addition, with all the scars, I am truly afraid to take credit for it still being praised by people in society now!</p>
<p>"Ode to the Police Soul" is the school song of the Central Police Academy and was designated by Dean Li Shizhen as the title of the film. Although not exactly appropriate, it is still in line with the film. When it was shown in Chongqing, it was extremely popular, running for 28 consecutive days, breaking all film records. This time, it is being shown in "Hu Guang" and renamed "Dare-to-Die Commando." I don't know who made the decision on their own and did not seek the author's consent. I don't know what the difference is between Chongqing and Shanghai. If it is for ticket sales, it is better to change it to "Spring Palace Erotic History."</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the completion of a film is not a personal matter but requires the cooperation of most people. The completion of "Ode to the Police Soul" took 15 months. During this long period, all the staff endured hardships, suffered hunger, and tasted all the bitterness. But today, all the advertisements and posters, large and small, do not list the names of anyone except for Director Tang Xiaodan, who printed his name in special type. Even the author is not included. "China Production" is a national cultural institution, and its productions are to promote social education, not to create a special social status for one or two people. In indignation, everyone went to question Peng Jieren, the person in charge of distribution at the "China Production" Shanghai office, only to find out that the manuscript originated from the director himself. This kind of personal egoism of "one general succeeds and ten thousand bones wither" is quite disappointing.</p>
<h3>Walt Disney's New Offering: A New Film Combining Live Action and Cartoons, "Song of the South"</h3>
<h3>New Film Reviews This Week</h3>
<p>— Ma Boling</p>
<p>Spy Ring Commando</p>
<p>An old story unfolds through a new form, at an extremely tense tempo. It has small scenes similar to "Upper Salsblinga," but "Spy Ring Commando" is more somber. It focuses on the lives and deaths of intelligence agents, with romantic love being just a subplot. The overall result is unexpectedly excellent. Director Irwin Penzel's technique is simple and delicate, gripping at every turn, and vigorous. His efforts are evident, and there are many unique creations. The small story at the beginning immediately gives people a complete surprise. The introduction of various new weapons and intelligence personnel training procedures is not at all verbose or redundant and can be said to be a few clever gimmicks. In the scene of the murder in the Barna telegraph room and Ellen's disappearance, Irwin Penzel cleverly avoided direct depiction but strengthened the power from the side. In Barna's courtship of the female telegraph operator and Martin's refusal to continue working, his intention is to add a bit of human touch, like "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo." The ending scene is very vivid and full of tragic grandeur. It can perhaps be said that Irwin has made great progress. In the 1944 film "Enchantment," his technique was flat and chaotic, but in 1945, "Along Came Jones" made him highly praised. Compared with "Along Came Jones," "Spy Ring Commando" has several times more complex plot, so it is, in other words, a more successful film.</p>
<p>The dubbing is amazing, the photography is fresh, the editing is smooth, and in terms of actors, Alan Ladd is much more outstanding than in "Enchantment." He and Loretta Young have equally lovely performances. Leah Baird is as clear as ever, and her eyes still look so far and firm.</p>
<p>Desert Song</p>
<p>A romantic title, the content is an overly romantic theme. I don't like this kind of excessive exaggeration, and I also hate this kind of megalomaniac American hero and beauty. If the story of "Desert Song" did not have the wildness of the grasslands like the French film "Les Fils de la Nuit," it should at least have the beautiful dreams like "Ugetsu," so as not to waste the colorful and dazzling flat sands. Why must it be changed to anti-Nazi? Why not use the theme of "The Steppe Story" from Gorky's "Russian Fairy Tales"! I always remember the beautiful scenes of Raymond Novarro and Lola Lane, America's screen sweetheart at the time, co-starring in the "Desert Song." The director has his merits. The hotel dance scene and the cavalry's all-out attack scene, along with that Arabic war song, should have the same aftertaste, but that is all.</p>
<p>Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio</p>
<p>A bundle of bizarre paintings unfolds, a murderous magic mirror, a puppet haunted by ghosts, a demon in an ancient castle, a portentous dream, eerie and terrifying, similar to "New York Stories," with less smooth connection, but with separate, complete, and beautiful stories. It is in the withered autumn afternoon that a few cups of tea bring out the realm, the horror that everyone imagines when sitting by the autumn lamp in the evening. The painting scroll is folded up, it is a nightmare, but the forest-lined road on the weekend enters the dream road again. It is precisely the beginning of another bizarre and mysterious painting scroll, and the changing imagination below is left to you.</p>
<h3>Explanation of Renaming — Tang Xiaodan</h3>
<p>My humble work "Dare-to-Die Commando," originally titled "Ode to the Police Soul," was completed in the rear filming location, which was full of air raid alarms, constant power outages, and outdated equipment, over a leisurely period of one year. All the staff, in a state of barely being able to eat and not starving to death, tightened their belts and worked hard for the public good. It was because of their loyalty to the arts that this film was worth watching. On New Year's Day this year, the film premiered at the only large theater in the capital city, Chongqing, and it was extremely popular, running for more than 120 screenings. This can be considered a bit of spiritual comfort to us amidst our hardships.</p>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance, many films returned to the capital one after another, and everyone scrambled to show them in this city. "Dare-to-Die Commando" was completed after the victory, so it was late in coming. With the success of the Chongqing box office, we thought that there was no need to rename the film at all because most of the returnees knew the film's name, or at least they could enthusiastically recommend it to their friends and relatives. But things turned out to be beyond our expectations. Apart from a few friends in the cultural field, the rest of the citizens did not know about this film. So, the theater owners all advocated that we change the film's name; otherwise, it would be impossible to attract audiences. So, we were subdued by the "Shanghai-style" approach!</p>
<p>The name "Dare-to-Die Commando" is very popular. It was changed for us by Manager Shi of the Shanghai Hu Guang Theater after watching the film. He has decades of film screening experience and deeply understands the psychology of Shanghai audiences. With such a confident vision, if we say that American films should be based on the opinions of showmen as a reference for production, then the change of "Ode to the Police Soul" to "Dare-to-Die Commando" is a first test. Anyway, the American film "Random Harvest" also needs to be changed to "Waterloo Bridge" to suit the tastes of Shanghai audiences. Why can't our "Ode to the Police Soul" also be changed to "Dare-to-Die Commando"? I am only afraid that if the film is not good, changing to a new name to deceive people would be damaging to virtue!</p>
<p>As expected, "Dare-to-Die Commando" has been showing in Hu Guang with a popular image and has been full every time. Afterwards, many Chinese-style American film titles were found in the newspaper film advertising columns, such as "Spy Ring Dare-to-Die Commando" and "Guerrilla Dare-to-Die Commando," all using the words "Dare-to-Die" as a slogan. So, I am even more suspicious. Do theater owners like "Dare-to-Die" so much? Or are our dear audiences particularly interested in "Dare-to-Die"?</p>
<p>However, ours is not a foreign "Dare-to-Die Commando" but an authentic domestic "Dare-to-Die" after all!</p>
<h3>Shifting the Base of Spoken Drama</h3>
<p>— Mo Jin</p>
<p>Shanghai's spoken drama theaters are only concentrated in the old French Concession area. For Hongkou, western Shanghai, Nanshi, and other areas, even if there are theaters, no spoken drama troupes are willing to perform in those places. Of course, the troupes themselves have many difficulties. For example, the theaters there are not suitable for performing spoken drama, and the number of audience members is small, which affects the number of performances. At the same time, it also affects business income. From the troupe's point of view, of course, we hope that they can perform more in areas with more audiences because this can prevent the troupe from suffering losses in business and extend the troupe's lifespan, which means that the life of spoken drama will be more lasting! However, from the audience's point of view, the troupe should perform near their environment for their sake so that they can all appreciate this higher-artistic-level spoken drama and guide them into the theater. This can also be said to be the responsibility of theater workers. From a third-party standpoint, Shanghai is, after all, a big city, and five or six million citizens are scattered in every corner of Shanghai. Those audiences far from the theater have no choice but to painfully sacrifice their appreciation of art because of the time and transportation costs! If we specifically want the troupe to rehearse a play to perform in Hongkou or western Shanghai and Nanshi, we dare not say that business is guaranteed. But moving a play that has already been performed to those places to perform for ten or eight days should be a win-win solution, right?</p>
<p>Although the "Audience Performance Company" is a newly established troupe, they have a great purpose and a sincere attitude that all theater workers should have! That is, everything is for the audience! We hope that all troupes have such a purpose: do not deceive the audience, do not deceive art, and do not deceive yourself! Based on their own artistic conscience, introduce the true art and full talent to the audience! On this point, the "Audience Performance Company" has undoubtedly already done it. Because the artistic workers who participated in the "Audience Performance Company" have been recognized for their attitude in several performances in the rear and in Shanghai!</p>
<p>For this reason, we can only hope that the "Audience Performance Company" initiates and leads this pioneering work: after each performance of a play, they can move it to other areas for performances again so that those audiences who do not have the opportunity to appreciate art can also see this complete and serious dramatic art!</p>
<p>We hope that the "Audience Performance Company" will start with "Unofficial History of the Qing Palace"! Move into theaters in other areas to perform and see the business situation and the number of audience members in those areas!</p>

<h3>Happiness Island</h3>
<p>— Fan Quan</p>
<p>(1) Jinshan</p>
<p>I was born in Lüxiang Town, Jinshan County, but I couldn't find a single mountain to visit in Jinshan County. When I was a child, I often imagined: What kind of sublime monster is a mountain? Perhaps the peak of the mountain can directly reach the sky because there are clouds in the sky, and the peak of the mountain is covered with clouds. From the clouds, I also thought of the stories of immortals riding the clouds and fog. I saw many immortals walking in the clouds in the popular comic strips. They did not expend any effort and could sit on the clouds, reaching Shanghai in an instant and flying to America in another. I thought, if there were mountains in Jinshan County, how proud I would be of myself! I might not hesitate to endure hardships and use all my strength to climb from the foot of the mountain to the top. So, I would catch the clouds on the top of the mountain and let my feet step on them, standing on the white clouds. Then I would blow a breath and push the clouds away from the top of the mountain, drifting aimlessly, drifting, drifting all the way to the beautiful place I longed for in my heart. I thought, why did humans have to invent airplanes? Airplanes can only carry a limited number of people, but the mountain—that mountain walking into the cloud ship—can carry countless people, and the vastness of the clouds is boundless. It can carry all of humanity, regardless of race or social status, drifting freely, drifting, drifting all the way to the place where humans want to go.</p>
<p>If humanity has an ideal Happiness Island, the clouds can drift to that Happiness Island according to your will, without limiting the number of people or social rank—it is a savior who saves all living beings.</p>
<p>How much I longed to have a golden, magnificent mountain!</p>
<p>(2) Blue Sea</p>
<p>When I was fourteen years old, I left my mother and came alone to study in the Jinshan County Middle School in Zhujing Town. At that time, I often missed home. Because of homesickness, a feeling of melancholy pierced my heart. I became lonely from melancholy and often quietly wandered on the grass of the playground. So, again and again, I used my arms as pillows and lay face up in the open field. The evening field seemed so quiet. Two or three crows划过过过through the azure sky, and a desolate long cry added to the infinite desolation of the field. But I loved that kind of emptiness and desolation. I lay there freely, looking up at the distant horizon, which made me feel the infinite enthusiasm of life. Yes, when I raised my eyes and saw the beautiful clouds, I thought of the beauty of life and the burning desire.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes wide, round, and passed through the vast sky. I saw the azure sky. The rosy sunset glow, like stars scattered everywhere in the azure sky. The azure sky seemed like a vast sea, and the rosy sunset glow seemed like islands scattered in the azure ocean. "Sea," I said in my heart, "What a vast distance the sea should have! I cannot measure it with a ruler, and I cannot see it with my eyes, but the sea, it connects the ends of the earth on one side and the corners of the earth on the other. It may be a boundless and bottomless Taijitu!"</p>
<p>I stared blankly at the sky and the sea, at the colorful sunset glow, as if I were in the sea. I saw all kinds of strange animals in the sea. I heard the roar of the tide and the cries of the seagulls, but it seemed to be gathered together, becoming a kind of musical rhythm. My lonely heart began to stir. I felt like I was happily wading in the sea. I was breaking through the waves, using all my strength to move forward bravely on the azure waves of the sea. What was I busy for in the azure sea? What was I groping for in the empty waves?</p>
<p>"Looking for Happiness Island!"</p>
<p>I answered like this.</p>
<p>The rhythm of music led me, and I did not hesitate to endure hardships and wade forward. Only in such wading did I not feel lonely in my heart. It seemed like thousands of people were following me. They enthusiastically encouraged me, guided me, and told me about the road to Happiness Island. "Yes, Happiness Island, that is not the happiness of one person, it is the Happiness Island of thousands of people! It is the Happiness Island of all mankind!" I finally suddenly realized.</p>
<p>So, I felt supreme joy.</p>
<h3>Dreams of Black and White</h3>
<p>— Song Mengqin</p>
<p>Because of an experience in a night dream, my spirit is in a daze all day long.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>When you hurriedly brought two cloaks of black and white, insisting that I choose one, I was truly at a loss. You raised a black one and handed it to me, making me even more hesitant. In that moment of indecision, you switched to the white cloak and put it on me, then hurriedly left again.</p>
<p>Even now, I still feel unhappy.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I asked you, "Why didn't you wait for me to decide and just leave the white one behind and run off?" You laughed and said, "Still so childish! Isn't it just a dream? Is it worth pondering for so long? If you didn't accept the black one I offered, naturally I'd give you the white one."</p>
<p>Friend, your answer is so lighthearted! But it also shows that you haven't thought deeply. Friend, my contemplation is not about the dream itself. I'm not superstitious, and I don't chase after the dream's essence. I can let things slip by, and I won't hold a grudge about a dream. My unhappiness stems from the fact that you didn't give me a chance to express my opinion in that moment of receiving and giving.</p>
<p>Black and white occupy opposite positions in the spectrum, and the feelings they give people are absolutely different. When people see black, hear black, or are aware of black, there is always a feeling of misery, coldness, dampness, desolation, rigidity, the end of the road, or the ultimate despair of death. This is not just a modern concept; it has existed since ancient times. Look at the construction of characters; aren't all meanings that abandon light derived from black? Like the characters "黝," "點," "黯," "黛," "黲," "黨," "黴," "墨," "讀," etc., are all good examples. Under people's subjective consciousness, these unfortunate characters have been symbols of gloom, baseness, and despair for thousands of years. "White is the color of happiness," that's what the political science textbook told me as soon as I started reading. Its position in people's imagery is so lofty. Therefore, the bright, pure, and great meanings of the characters "皇," "皎," "晳," "皚," "晶," "皓," "皓," "皓," "皎," "暾," "暉," "嚼" all come from white.</p>
<p>People should dislike black and like white, abandon black and follow white. Indeed, I have liked white since I was a child, perhaps because my mother liked to dress me in white after I was born. Therefore, I reject everything that is the opposite of white and close to black, and I try my best to choose white for everything around me.</p>
<p>Has living with white for more than ten years made me a little tired of it? Why is human thought so mysterious! Do you remember? One autumn evening five years ago, I seemed to have said something like this to you: "...my disappointment in black is not as heavy as my worry about white." I remember you said at the time, "Don't get angry when I say you're a child... but your thoughts contain philosophy..." I didn't pay attention to what philosophy it was, I only knew that my inner consciousness was like this. When I see white, hear white, and am aware of white, I immediately start to worry. From that time on, I avoided contact with white.</p>
<p>Friend, do you say I'm too fickle? Do you say my will is too weak? Do you say my cultivation of life is lacking? I admit all of these, and I have long felt guilty about it - at least before you said it! But emotions are mysterious; not only can I not control their arrival, but I have involuntarily been swept away by them. Now, involuntarily, I am changing again. The strangest thing is that I think this change has sufficient reason to drive me. The love of white seems to have no trace left in my mind, and I already feel that worrying about white is meddling. I have carefully analyzed it, and all things that cause people to worry have an inherent factor that accepts destruction! The feeling of worrying about white is nothing more than worrying about its being easily stained. But of the thousands upon thousands of colors, which one is not dyed by white? Even if white is something with a will, how can it hold fast to its unblemished state? But after a long time of erosion by sunlight and dust, it will silently be enveloped in a layer of yellow. Human efforts can be avoided, but the power of nature cannot be escaped. White! How much of your final state can be pure?</p>
<p>Because of this, some friends have recently ridiculed me as a "glass idealist." However, there is no way for me to tell the injustices I suffer. Glass is nothing more than taking the meaning of colorless and transparent, which seems very detached. But you must know that it reflects whatever color is behind it. Rather than saying that colorless and transparent is the most neutral, it is better to say that it is sitting on the fence; rather than saying that it is detached, it is better to say that it is cunning!</p>
<p>Friend, I have changed, I admit that I have changed. Today I discovered the characteristics of black. Only black is the most steadfast, only black is the most tolerant, only black is the most thorough, and only black is the most permanent. Black is great and noble, but who understands it? Yes, understood, it is black; not understood, it is still black; ridiculed, it is black; hated, it is still just black. It is precisely because it is rejected by people that it succeeds in its peaceful integrity; it is precisely because it is considered hopeless that it establishes its independent color personality. Can white possibly do these things? White and black are just names that refer to reality; if white must be named pure and great, it seems that it would not hurt to switch the name and the reality. But this is definitely not something that black cares about.</p>
<p>Friend, why did you misunderstand me, and in a dream?</p>
<h3>Pioneer</h3>
<p>— Shang Mozong</p>
<h3>Expectation</h3>
<p>— Shengjie</p>
<p>"Expectation" is like a small boat sailing towards the vast and boundless shore, forever wandering in the ocean.</p>
<p>Even though I know that this kind of expectation is superfluous, I still turn pain into pleasure! Isn't pain caused by excessive pleasure? Entrust your expectations to distant fantasies, just like waiting for light in a long night, look forward to it with a happy mood!</p>
<p>Everything can be forgotten, only expectation cannot be diluted by any force. "Expectation" has its mysterious traces in every stage of a person's entire life.</p>
<p>In the universe, there is not a single second that is not expectation, whether it is short or eternal. We come into contact with many people and things every day, and these people and things influence us to produce countless expectations; sometimes, when you occasionally see someone else make a windfall, you envy him, and even sincerely imitate him, and the greatest expectation suddenly arises in your heart; sometimes, you meet a very beautiful woman, and she unintentionally turns her head and gazes at you, or makes an unintentional movement, and you are immediately attracted by her magic, your heart is tempted by her, your heart will keep beating, and a cloud of expectation floats in your mind like an electric shock.</p>
<p>In this vast world, this kind of "expectation" flows like the endless water of the Yangtze River, day and night, and can also be said to be a kind of nervous stimulation, but it cannot be denied that it is a kind of expectation, but it will pass like a shooting star in an instant. If you are entangled by this kind of expectation, then the impulsive emotion will turn into a permanent expectation; in the short journey of life, you will be concerned by these expectations, and even fall into the abyss of pain. However, on that future day filled with the dawn, you will have unlimited enthusiasm for her arrival, expecting such an ideal day. The poetic traces of dreams disappear from your luxurious years, you walk into the desolate wilderness, wandering in the bitter cold of the night, you will wistfully and quietly exhale a breath, this breath contains thousands of sad emotions, and even feels indescribably uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Life is a comprehensive symphony composed of various mysterious rhythms, and this piece can represent various different moods, joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness...; and "expectation" is also like a beautiful and moving song, if you go closer to listen to it, it will add countless troubles to your thinking, if you appreciate it silently from a distance, it will make you nostalgic, and it will also evoke that poetic fantasy, forever hovering in your yearning.</p>
<p>This song is a distant hope, an optimistic fantasy, a lost lover will return to his arms, a lost beloved thing will be found again, a dead body can be reborn. Everything in the world is unpredictable, sometimes infinite pain, sometimes wild joy like a landslide. If "expectation" really comes to an end, this beautiful and moving song will release a loud voice, singing to its heart's content, roaring to its heart's content, as if a prisoner serving an indefinite sentence in a long and dreary dungeon has discovered light and freedom.</p>
<p>The years of youth are like glittering stars, flying past like a dream. In this long process, my every word, every sentence, every action, has disappeared in expectation. Therefore, I am most afraid of seeing the two words "expectation," and I also hate others mentioning "expectation"; however, on the other hand, a contradictory psychology does drive me to like it, to be inseparable from it, and in countless sleepless nights, I have used distant reverie to "expect"; at that time, emotions cannot be controlled, and as long as there is some stir of breeze and drizzle, the sensitive will immediately recognize it as the prelude to the arrival of expectation, gradually stimulating the enthusiasm sealed in the heart, bursting out like a waterfall, this prelude will shock the entire world, like a volcanic eruption shaking the universe, and creating an indelible hope in life—"expectation."</p>
<p>If a third party stands in another world and quietly observes each expecting person, he will feel that expectation is too precious. It has immeasurable power, mysteriously manipulating the crowd in the universe. Is it a bright guide for people? Or does it use seductive charm to control the crowd? It is like a hero who has been on the battlefield for a long time, always surrounding the circle of life, fighting and listening, turning those precious moments and pure and sincere affection into a small boat on the ocean, allowing the sea breeze to blow, the huge waves to overturn the sky, and always being in danger of being sunk at the bottom of the sea; if, by chance, it survives, it will still live a wandering life, sailing towards the endless other shore, eternally and eternally, forcing a smile and expecting, this long expectation makes the intelligent crowd add a layer of painful melancholy!</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 61</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Uncle...!" a tender childish voice.</p>
<p>"Mr. Yue...!" a clear and crisp throat.</p>
<p>What is this all about? I went to all this trouble, braving the gunfire to get here, wasn't it because these two people were missing? Why, when I get here, are they standing here safe and sound, as if nothing had happened?</p>
<p>"These two have just returned, less than ten minutes ago," the action commander said with a slight smile. "Mu Lai was resting, and when she heard you were coming, she asked me not to say anything..."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Mr. Yue," Yaoqun giggled, "to trouble you, cause you so much trouble and worry... but we can't completely blame us either, it's just that there was really no way to communicate and report our whereabouts - we haven't been idle from morning till now."</p>
<p>She was wearing a "security team" uniform, with a pistol hanging on her armed belt. Her skin seemed to have been dyed, and it was much older and darker than when I saw her a few days ago. She was originally dressed as a man; dressed like this, if she didn't speak, even I wouldn't be able to tell at first glance that she was a woman. Moreover, her vocal cords were quite wide, and her chest cavity was heavier than that of ordinary women. If she suppressed her voice a little, she sounded like a young man.</p>
<p>Little Tiger was dressed in the same way as Yaoqun, but he had a shaved head like a monk, his eyes were still so big and round, surrounded by a circle of long eyelashes. He was originally standing next to Yaoqun, but when he saw me staring, he seemed a little scared and hid his body behind Yaoqun's clothes.</p>
<p>"So..." I just opened my mouth to speak.</p>
<p>"The Beiping has already notified the team leader," Yaoqun had already guessed what I was going to say, "and asked them to dispel the news... I originally planned to ask you not to bother, but it was too late..."</p>
<p>"Very good," I nodded. "Please go and rest. I'd like to hear about your experience later, how exactly did you two go together...?"</p>
<p>After all, Jingqun was young and strong, and Little Tiger had practiced such deep martial arts, so of course he didn't feel tired. He just said, "We just ate, and we were just about to report what happened." At first, I thought that the two of them had, at most, gone to the enemy's side to scout out some information, or just ran to the front line to join in the fun; who could have expected that they had gone deep into the lair, and in the enemy's den, it could be said that they had caused a heaven-overturning change.</p>
<p>Here, I will repeat Yaoqun's oral account as completely as I can remember; the "I" below is Yaoqun herself:</p>
<p>That morning, the team leader (i.e., Mr. W) explained clearly the key points of going to Tongzhou - where to go, who to meet, what work to do - and repeatedly instructed them before setting off that there were many enemy agents active from the station onwards; every move must be very careful. He also said, "Although we are rewarded for doing things, we are not given preferential treatment, but we are severely punished for mistakes and dereliction of duty. Everything must be done in cooperation with the commander of the Changdi headquarters, and there must be no going beyond the rules, unless there is no other choice but to act alone, but you must also try to contact the headquarters."</p>
<p>We (i.e., Yaoqun and Hucheng) arrived at the station at exactly 6:07 or 6:08. Because the enemy and I often have small conflicts in this area, the train cannot run according to the timetable. The only way to know is to hang a temporary sign to notify. On this day, the sign was hung, indicating that there would be a train at 7:00 sharp. I and my younger brother Hu waited at the station to buy tickets. Who knew that we waited until 5 minutes before 7:00, but still didn't see any action to buy tickets. What was especially strange was that apart from a few villagers, I didn't see anyone waiting for the train. When I asked someone at the station, I found out that the matter of hanging signs to sell tickets was not very reliable; even if the tickets were sold, there was still no train, which was also a common occurrence. Ordinary people mostly take cars, ride bikes, or walk.</p>

<h3>Scenery of the North Station</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>The autumn sky is high and the air is crisp, and people have the leisure to go on an outing. I have a suggestion, please ask him to take a sightseeing tour of the North Station. That scene will make those with elegant interests feel refreshed, and those with benevolent hearts feel compassion.</p>
<p>There is too little empty space on the platform, so little that the passengers coming in and out have no choice but to squeeze through these walls of people, or endure the "ground paved with people." The "walls of people" are the rows of people lined up to buy tickets. I heard a porter's sigh, which described its length: "Um! Sixteenth Road!" The "human ground" is completely in a sitting or lying position, with old people with white hair and long beards, and babies as young as three or four months old, men and women, even quilts, pillows, and bedding are complete, and the cement has become their hotel.</p>
<p>I didn't inquire about what these people were there for. Judging from their appearance, they weren't necessarily treating the North Station as a shelter, or waiting to buy train tickets; if my estimate is correct, then I have to admire some of the railway authorities in the towering building opposite that scene. Did they not see it, or did they see it and not care?</p>
<h3>Banning Hong Kong Shirts</h3>
<p>— Ganlai</p>
<p>The "Hong Kong shirt" that was popular in Shanghai in the summer should actually be called the "Hawaiian shirt," because this kind of clothing was originally created by the natives of that archipelago. Its advantages are that it is cool, convenient, and economical, and it can be called the standard summer clothing for tropical regions.</p>
<p>This summer outfit was transmitted from Hawaii to Hong Kong, and then spread from Hong Kong to various parts of China. By mistake, it was changed to the name "Hong Kong shirt." It entered Shanghai in the summer of the 28th year of the Republic of China. It was first worn by a few overseas Chinese children who returned to China, swaggering through the streets. The cloth used was red and green, and the colors were colorful. When Shanghai people first saw this kind of short-sleeved, waist-hugging, non-Chinese, non-Western, strange dress, they only felt surprised at first, and there were not many people who imitated it. It was not until the summer of the 29th year that the "Hong Kong shirt" began to show its face in Shanghai, and almost every young person prepared one or two sets. Later, on the one hand, due to the delay of the war, the source of materials gradually dried up, and the prices of goods rose frequently, especially clothing cloth. The material used for this kind of Hong Kong shirt is less than a Western shirt, and it can save the trouble of a Western top and tie. Compared with the Chinese-style short shirt and trousers, the material is more economical, and the appearance is more beautiful. On the other hand, it happened to be summer, and Shanghai people tried wearing this new summer clothing, and they really felt relaxed and very comfortable. Therefore, the "Hong Kong shirt" became popular in Shanghai for a while. Today, there are no less than two or three hundred factories and shops specializing in Hong Kong shirts. When summer comes, if you try to look at the pedestrians on the street, eight or nine out of ten are wearing "Hong Kong shirts."</p>
<p>Guangdong Province is close to the tropics, and the summer season is hotter than Shanghai. There must be more people wearing "Hong Kong shirts." However, recently, the Guangdong Provincial Government suddenly ordered its affiliated agencies to warn employees not to wear "Hawaiian shirts" during office hours, believing that this kind of clothing is unsightly and loses decorum. It is said that on the 19th of last month, a section chief of a certain subordinate bureau of the Provincial Government temporarily forgot the ban and actually wore a Hong Kong shirt directly into Luo Zhuoying's private Qiu to pay his respects to the chairman of the Provincial Government. The next day, he was dismissed by Luo's order. After reading this news, the following thoughts arise:</p>
<p>Hong Kong shirts have their undeniable advantages: economy, convenience, and coolness. Although the Guangdong Provincial Government's accusation of being unsightly and losing decorum is not without basis, it is still too demanding. Moreover, today's civil servants, if they are honest and upright, it is not easy to wear a neat and clean Hong Kong shirt. Do you want them to all wear silk clothes to "enhance the appearance and maintain decorum"? I'm afraid that even if the chairman agrees, their salaries, their parents, wives, and daughters will not agree, right?</p>
<p>Banning Hong Kong shirts, I think, should be taken as a joke!</p>
<h3>Many Things in the Buddhist Temple</h3>
<p>— Hongyu</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Council raised the issue of temples, it has stirred up a huge wave of monks' petitions. Who knew that the big wave had not subsided, but the small waves within the Buddhist temple were rising one after another. In Shanghai's most famous Jing'an Temple, two monks, Dewu and Mika, were arrested by the court on suspicion of being traitors. Following this, the property of Xizhu Temple was generously donated by the original owner, Zhifang, to the Chinese Buddhist Hospital because Mika was arrested. There was also the abbot of Luohan Temple, who, after his death, his mistress recruited another monk to temporarily act as the owner of the temple, but the disciples of the temple refused to accept it and firmly opposed it. This scandal has not yet been resolved. Recently, in Wanshou Nunnery, there has been a scandal of the "Wu Zetian" (Wu Zetian is the nickname of Chen Jiangshi, a woman from Jiangbei) who lives upstairs, selling drugs. The head monk, Jiyuan, is a drug addict and is also Wu Zetian's adopted father. With such tangled Buddhist scandals, no wonder a certain director in the council wanted to frankly reveal their clean but not really clean inside story. Although the momentum was turbulent at the time, and the crowd of bald heads wanted to accuse him of defamation, the facts are now in front of us, so what is there to say? Alas! "Buddhist countries have fate, and Buddhist teachings are related." Is that how it should be explained? Sin! Sin!</p>
<h3>Map</h3>
<p>— Chu Pinwen</p>
<p>Reading Mr. Weiran's linen book in the Sixth Column of Japan makes one feel infinite emotion. This kind of situation is indeed quite common in our China. A few days ago, the author also encountered a similar thing. It was an evening around the third day. The author was wandering on the street and happened to see a conversational book for junior high school students. Its name was "Daily English Conversation," published by Evans. Driven by curiosity, he stopped and flipped through it. On the back cover, he discovered a shocking trademark. It turned out that the trademark seemed to be a topographical map of our country. However, in this black topographical map, there were only the provinces of Central and Southern China (because it was just a black shadow, it was impossible to tell exactly which provinces were included). However, it could be clearly distinguished that there was no Xinjiang, no Tibet, and no Northeast. Seeing it was really frightening. This absurd situation may have occurred in the concession era and the fatuous enemy-puppet era. In the former, because the imperialists had long not considered the border provinces as our country's territory, and in the latter, they simply listened to the commands of the Japanese invaders. However, looking at the inside of the back cover, it was clearly printed: "Published in May of the 35th year of the Republic of China." I really don't know how he was allowed to publish it and sell it in large quantities. I don't even know if it is because of the great national style and "not being concerned with trifles"?</p>
<h3>Self-Description of a Telegram Draft</h3>
<p>— Jingcao</p>
<p>On the day I was born, the telegraph operator wrote the four characters "(Extremely Urgent)" on my head. This is what I am most proud of. The code translator copied my identity on a telegram paper and drew three "ten" characters and three circles on top of my head and handed it to the clerk. The clerk signed a date and stamped a private seal on it, seemingly unconcerned. However, how anxious I was in my heart! I waited for a full five hours in the section chief's office. The three "ten" characters on my head made me sweat all over. The section chief easily wrote the two characters "for review" and sent it to the director's mansion. The director was not at home, and his wife took me down, stuffed me into a drawer, and I suffered from afternoon until noon the next day. If it wasn't for the maid tidying the drawer, my life would have come to an end. The director was furious and stamped his feet because I was discriminated against, and scolded the maid severely, but the wife didn't say a word. The director wrote the six big characters "Hand it over to Section Chief × to handle quickly" on my face. The section chief held his pen and rested his head, smoking four cigarettes before replying to me, but I didn't feel satisfied. The director didn't even see clearly what the section chief had written, and then waved "as proposed"; then handed it over to the clerk × to draft, and waited a long time again. After the section chief's supplement and modification, the director forcefully wrote a big and thick character "Okay," and returned to the code translator's hand to change his appearance. By the time the telegraph operator removed my task, a total of two and fourteen hours had passed.</p>
<h3>Humanitarianism</h3>
<p>— Li Xiao</p>
<p>A talked about retribution, saying, "Killing cows in this life, reincarnating as a cow in the next life, killing pigs in this life, turning into a pig in the next life, even killing a bird, an insect, or an ant, you must turn into a bird, an insect, or an ant in the next life." B said, "Then, you can only kill people."</p>
<p>Someone eats beef but does not eat shrimp paste soy sauce. Everyone asked why. He replied, "Killing a cow can be eaten countless times, only one life is lost. One spoonful of shrimp paste soy sauce loses countless lives. We humans cannot abstain from killing, we only seek to kill less." Everyone ridiculed him.</p>

<h3>Short Takes</h3>
<p>— ww</p>
<p>Except for those with hearts of stone, most people value relationships. In small matters, if someone lends you half a bowl of rice, you must return a whole bowl. If someone pays for my streetcar fare, I must treat them to snacks. When I got married, they gave me 100,000 CRB (even on the day it was announced that 200 was equivalent to 1), now that they are getting married, I must also give them 100,000 CNC. In the past, reciprocity was the norm in human relations; one absolutely could not be stingy. One would pawn their long underwear or go hungry, but it had to be done to avoid being considered unkind and giving people reason to speak harshly.</p>
<p>Consider the names of our Chinese women, mostly choosing orchids, chrysanthemums, fragrant pearls, and beautiful jade. However, with the progress of the times, everything new replaces the old, which is also the law of natural selection. Thus, there are those who, despite being like Dong Shi, choose "Beautiful" for a name. There are those who add "Beauty" to "Beauty" or "Saliva" to "Beauty," and even those who hide their original names and choose "Mona" or "Lover." This is utterly appalling and breathtaking. Even more, there are those who consider themselves avant-garde and choose "Manly," "Lily," or "Alice," following in the footsteps of Europe and America. Therefore, parents must observe their children's personalities and choose appropriate names; otherwise, it would be better to call out numbers like ticket sellers, which is more straightforward. Like a certain gentleman at sea who has too many children, it might be better to use a numbering system and wear a family crest to avoid being unfamiliar and becoming a laughingstock!</p>
<p>"Heaven is above, earth is below, conscience is in the middle, if you cheat me out of a penny, you are a bastard." Under the principle of never doing business that loses money no matter how many deals you do, it's unexpected that businessmen have such a decisive and inviolable principle.</p>
<p>Aren't non-business people the same? "We come from the people, to seek benefits for the people, not afraid of death, not wanting money, three—Three Principles of the People!" Why the red face and ears? Listening to his inaugural declaration, it sounds like he earnestly wants to decline gifts. However, what will it be like when he resigns? Should we eliminate the corrupt elements who disgrace the Three Principles of the People?</p>
<p>"On the Double Tenth Festival, all parks in the city are open for free, allowing anyone to visit."</p>
<p>Having to have a "pass" to enter a "public" park is still an exploitative policy left by foreigners. This time, thanks to the glory of National Day, common people can enter for free. We must truly thank the martyrs for their bloodshed. Following old customs is acceptable in good areas. However, parks are one of the city's municipal facilities, so how can they be listed as a source of tax revenue? Furthermore, public officials often enter without a "pass" by virtue of their "plum blossom badge," swaggering in while the gatekeepers nod and wave them in. Isn't this tax evasion?</p>
<p>Li Qingping's applying of rouge and powder, drawing eyebrows and eyes, is precisely the demeanor of an artist. Why is there any need to consider it strange? What is strange is that she was on the list, yet they waited until three days after her art exhibition ended before arresting her. Why the delay?</p>
<h3>Breathtaking</h3>
<p>— Ganlai</p>
<p>Not long ago, I saw an advertisement for "yellow publications" in the newspaper, described in vivid and graphic detail, truly a feat of "pleasing the eye and delighting the heart."</p>
<p>Recently, there is a type of "secretary" in Guangzhou that is also commonly sold at newspaper stands. The cover of the book is printed with the following line of words:</p>
<p>"Notice to Readers: Those above the age of sixteen and below the age of fifty should not buy this book!"</p>
<p>The four words below are especially large. As a result, readers rushed to buy it, making it a bestseller for a time.</p>
<p>Tell the publishing "merchants" in Shanghai and the bosses of yellow publications that you can "imitate" this once. You can save a huge amount of advertising fees and avoid racking your brains when drafting the advertisement, and the resulting effect may not be that much different. Why not do it?</p>
<h3>Talking About the Haining Tide</h3>
<p>— Yang Ren</p>
<p>The Qiantang River tide is a magnificent spectacle. However, tides exist everywhere in the world, so why is only the one on the eighteenth day of the eighth lunar month famous? According to folklore, there is a reason for this: After Emperor Yongzheng of the Qing Dynasty seized the throne by killing his brother, his conscience was troubled, and he became suspicious and anxious. Therefore, he named his elder brother "King of the Tide" to be the god of the tide. He built the "Temple of the Sea God" in Haining City to worship him and set the eighteenth day of the eighth lunar month as the date of sacrifice (or according to the appropriate hour), probably with the intention of "everlasting incense and eternal offerings" to appease the spirit. At that time, coastal residents, to ensure that the sea would not cause trouble and for their own peaceful lives, would gather before the god on the day of the sacrifice, burn incense, and pray. Tourists and merchants also gathered to enjoy the spectacle. Over time, it became a custom, eventually evolving into the famous "Watching the Haining Tide on the Eighteenth Day of the Eighth Month" that is known at home and abroad. (According to the Haining County Chronicle, the construction date of the Temple of the Sea God matches this legend, so this story is likely not fictional.)</p>
<p>The rise and fall of sand in the Qiantang River are very strange. Sometimes, in just a few days, dozens of square miles of sand suddenly rise from the sea, "accumulating sand into land," lasting for hundreds of years without collapsing, allowing residents to cultivate the land. Sometimes, areas of sand covering dozens of square miles can completely collapse in just a few days once a crack appears.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, the seawall was neglected and deteriorated day by day. The safety of the people in the seven counties north of the sea was also lost. Although local officials and civilians made every effort to repair it, even a complete stone seawall could not withstand the destruction of the raging tide. What good would some dirt and tree branches do? Just when things were critical, it was truly a "heavenly blessing in times of emergency." Suddenly, a vast expanse of sand rose along the thirty-mile stretch of the coast (from Haining East to Xinjiu Cang). This area was where the tide was most powerful. With the sand blocking it, the force of the impact was greatly reduced. As a result, the dilapidated stone seawall and the temporary rescue efforts were able to last until victory.</p>
<p>According to elders, when the Taiping Rebellion occurred, the seawall was severely damaged. A major disaster was avoided due to the sand rising along the coast.</p>
<p>Who would have thought that this stubborn sand has repeatedly played a major role in protecting the lives of the people!</p>
