<p>〔本報重慶廿七日電〕政治協商會議大部份已獲協議，政府組織組及國大組，商討次一步之部長等問匙，據一般推測，大原則旣已解決，則次要問題亦可順利完成。關於國大舊代表問題，只要政府對於修改憲草等要項有所保證，則亦可有謀得協議。至於改組政府問題，因現尙爲訓政時期，故政府將於二月間舉行二中全會，在全會中通過後再施諸實行。據吳國楨表示，出版法亦將於二月一日開始修改。</p>
<p>〔本報重慶廿七日電〕出席政治協商會議中共代表周恩來，廿七日晨九時飛返延安，廿八日下午可返渝，參加廿九日之閉幕禮。據悉：周氏返延，係報告此次協商會議經過，並對軍事三人小組商談中共軍隊整編情澎與停止軍事衝突等問題，均有所請示。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿七日電〕政治協商會議政府組織組及國大組兩委員會，今未舉行會議，預定廿八日下午開會，繼續協商。</p>
<p>〔合衆社重慶廿七日電〕政治協商會議民主同盟代表雖暫時退席，今日據宣布，關於政府組織一案，刻正計劃採取內蘭制，准許各黨各派參加，此項消息傳出後，會議又有圓滿結束之希望矣。據決議，中國新憲法將規定組織兩院內閣制，而非總統制之政府。至此政治協商會議已獲充分進步，使觀察家相信，實際之聯合政府，雖須在國民大會制定憲法並舉行大選以後始能成立，但臨時政府即將組織成立，由各黨各派參加。</p>

<p>〔聯合社重慶廿七日電〕政治協商會議各小組委員會，原定今日開會，討論國民大會及政府改組問題，旋因民主同盟退出會議而臨時取消。民主同盟之退會，乃對於警察不法搜查該黨若干黨員寓所，表示抗議，並因中央不能實踐本月十日所宣布之保障身體權利，賦予政黨合法權利，扶植地方自治政府及釋放純粹政治犯一等四　諾言，表示不滿。據民主同盟發言人羅隆基談稱：本黨已於昨夜向蔣主席提出醫面抗議，靜候回答，對付警察非法搜查本黨黨員寓所，如能獲得滿意保證，蔣主席如能決定日期，說明其對四項諾言之立塲，則民主同盟可立即停止退會。政府代表張羣，今晨曾訪問民主同盟總部，殆欲阻止其退會，但發現部內　無一人，同時，此間一般感覺，退會問題如不能立刻解決，則原定廿九日閉幕之協商會議，有繼續延長會期必要。</p>
<p>〔聯合社重慶廿六日電〕民主同盟代表羅隆基，今日在政治協商會議中發表爆炸性之言辭，據稱：民主同盟代表黃炎培住宅，竟遭警察搜查，苟政府對此事未能作滿意解釋，民主同盟將退出政治協商會議。據羅隆基談稱：共黨代表周恩來今晨曾發表演說，要求政府對各代表加以充分保護，重慶中共辦事處亦會有警察光臨，託詞調查戶口，史良及張申府住宅，亦有警察造訪，至於各小組商談結果，羅氏謂已議定，將來總統發布命令，須由國府會議核准，國府會議五分之三之多數所通過之決議，總統無否決權。關於此層，國民黨原要求須三分之二之多數，國府委員名額定爲四十人，國民黨佔半數，其他各黨各派佔半數，此項改組計劃，周恩來已獲得延安同意，國民大會如何組織一項，尙未獲解決。</p>

<p>〔聯合社重慶二十七日電〕外國著名人物，悄然來渝，避免引人注意，原屬數見不鮮，但美國駐蘇大使哈里曼，今日無意之間，完成此舉。哈里曼係自莫斯科取道回國，到達重慶機塲，較預定時間早二十四小時，結果機塲無人照料，但此種情形，立刻設法補救，哈氏經與馬歇爾大使官邸通電話後，即有侍從一人急往機塲，同時蔣主席聞訊，亦暫擱他務，招待哈氏，馬歇爾原來計劃亦經改變，主席遣人邀其同餐，並在主席官邸過宿，馬使驅車至官邸會晤哈氏，三人共同談話，哈氏定二十九日晨離渝，在返國以前，將赴朝鮮及日本一行。</p>

<p>突擊總隊本日表演的課目有三，首爲定點降落，在二千英尺上空操縱降落傘，設法使之落於定點內，這不是一件容易的工作，當時第一個降落者，爲錢明年少校，一個廿一歲的北平靑年，在軍校十七期炮科畢業後，即由軍訓部選送赴美，投入喬治亞州傘兵學校受訓，卅三年九月，學成歸國，現在該隊傘訓處兼主任。據聞他是中國在美受傘兵敎育的第一人，在校時成續甚佳，故於今日表演中博得觀衆好評，當其降落後，他的四十二歲的母親，親往扶持擁抱，並在其蒙塵的雙頰上，狂吻了半分鐘，觀衆稱奇。第二個跳傘者，係一位臨時參加的將軍，本前毫未徵求其夫人的同意，當其降落後，隨觀衆之後鼓堂趨迎，審視之乃其丈夫，張前司令驚奇之餘，報以嘉慰的言笑。據張氏談稱：此次跳傘表演，實係處女作，當離機前，曾有半秒鐘的猶豫，初張傘時，神志頗糢糊，約一分鐘始告淸醒，遂能操縱自如速度的在目標圈內降落。</p>
<p>精彩的戰鬥跳傘</p>
<p>繼爲延期張傘，在六干英尺高空自由降落，至一千五百英尺以下始張傘，從雲　到着地，歷時約三分鐘，担任此次表演者，爲祝宗權上尉，他是西南聯大地質系學生，初任突擊總隊譯員，旋在該隊受傘兵訓練，卒業後即任敎官。當其跳傘畢，某要公之姪女孔氏姊妹甚表嘉勉，梅校長貽琦亦頷首微笑，陳納德將軍緊握其手，稱讀不已。這個課目演過後，輪到了最精彩的傘兵分隊戰鬥跳傘，參加者爲傘訓處全體官兵廿四人，人員與武器，在八百英尺低空降落後，十五分鐘內即集合成戰鬥隊形，以火箭砲，火熖噴射器等，羣向假設目標作實彈進擊，參觀的美軍見其槍法不錯，贊賞雀躍。</p>
<p>陳納德將軍講評</p>
<p>十一時五十分表演畢，該隊馬司令即召集演習歸來的官兵請陳納德將軍講評，陳氏略謂：此次參觀演習個人很感興趣，兩年前中國即有訓練傘兵計劃，但其時深感各種裝備缺乏，後因各位的堅强奮鬥，致有今日之成果。今日表演時，動作迅速，紀律良好，足證各位平時的訓練很佳，嗣後在馬司令指揮下努力邁進，前途益無限量。講評畢，錢少校之母即以橘子分片，慰勞各傘兵，堪稱一幕小餘興。</p>

<p>〔本報北平二十七日電〕本報記者今午乘調處部飛機飛抵赤峯，該處遠在十三年前之春，即綱東三省而倫陷，光復未久之今日，復因中蘇軍交接防務及政府軍與共軍衝突，而吸引舉國目光。今午美機七一五三號降落赤峯郊外二十里機場後，首先得自附近農民之報告，即赤峯蘇軍確已於一月二十三日乘汽車向林西一帶撤退，市內由似在共黨領導下之常地保安隊維持秩序惟警戒機塲之保安隊劉姓隊長則又聲稱，彼等純爲日軍退後之地方自衛組織，當非入路軍。距赤峯不遠亦有八路軍，八路軍目前與政府軍之距離爲二十里，最近無衝突，今日吾等僅見之該處代表人物之保安隊，於飛機降落半小時後，自東南方徒步走至機塲，共的二十餘人，皆穿繳自日軍之皮大衣，有一官佐軍帽上之緣星帽徽亦未取去，槍械三八式與韓麟春式各有若干。帶隊之劉隊長，爲一中等身材，瘦削而謙和之軍人，自稱九一八前服務東北軍，其後即在熱河一帶經商，另一不知姓名之年輕官佐，自稱係山西平遙人，淪陷後被拉至熱河作挖煤苦工，彼曾檢查調處部來人所携物件，經記者解釋勸阻乃止。吾等曾延彼二人至機上，共享美軍帶來之糕點·糖果，彼等受寵若驚，一時羞澀幾無法下咽。今日飛機於上午十一時四十分到達距北平約九百餘里之赤峯機塲後，熱心之合衆社記者與美籍駕駛員二人，急欲至赤峯城會見和平小組人員附近農民以毛驢三頭供其代步，行未二里，即被巡邏之保安隊斕回，飛機塲與赤峯城電話破壞，保安隊乃差人騎馬代吾等送一信至城中，請和平小組速派汽車來接，直至下午三時半，金烏西墜，持望遠鏡頻頻遠眺，猶不見有何車彤，吾等遂於保安隊官兵瞠目莫知所措中，乘機起飛轉回北平。然該處人民對國家之熱愛，將永印記者腦海，蜂湧而來瞻望飛機與新客之農民中，有一人獲悉吾等由平至該處，僅費一時半之時間，不勝興奮謂：「祖國復與了，眞有辦法」。自飛機下鳥瞰赤峯，爲山巒環抱中之一平原，田疇相接，村落棋布，非如想像中之一片沙漢。直貫腹地之一條鐵路，雖僅僅破車三五，亦爲此半原始地帶帶來不少現代化氣息。大地樹木　寥，氣候與北平無大差異，僅山巔有薄雪，奔至機塲之兒童，皆僅穿棉襖褲，田間農民已開始堆集肥料，準備春耕，農田物主要爲高梁，大豆，小米，去年有五六成收獲，日人未及徼糧即敗退，農村尙有存糧，現保安隊開始按戶借糧，舊年將屆，人民已奉令攤派肉菜勞軍。目前該處仍通行僞滿票，至蘇聯軍用標，市塲幾已不能使用。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據倫敦二十八日廣播稱，靈通方面宣稱，明日下午三時召開之安全理事會，將討諭伊朗與蘇聯申訴，關於此事，世界均極注目。但據最近消息，安全理事會鑒於伊朗已表示願與蘇聯直接談判，故將暫緩予以討論，視談判結果再作決定，此事料將在明日之安全理車會會議中宣佈。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦二十六日電〕聯合國大會伊朗代表團今日再度以二千字照會一件，送呈安全理事會，聲稱，蘇聯干涉伊朗內政，可以提供充分證據。安全理事會現定于星期一討論伊朗問題，惟伊朗新總理沙丹納與蘇聯素稱親善，以是聯合國大會各國代表咸揣測，伊朗對蘇控訴或有自動撤消從事直接談判之可能。不意伊朗代表適在此際，又提出新照會，用以答覆蘇聯所提出之備忘錄。該備忘錄曾稱，依據一九二一年條約，蘇聯在伊朗地位係屬合法，伊朗所控各節，全非事實。伊朗照會則稱，蘇聯政府不許伊朗軍隊在伊朗領土內通過，顯係違反一九四二年三國協定及德黑蘭宣言，依照此項宣言，各聯合國應尊重伊朗領土完整，主權及政治之獨立。先是伊朗駐美大使赫辛阿拉曾在華府發表談話稱，希望新總理不致放棄請求安全理事會解決伊朋問題，與蘇聯直接交涉勢必徒費時間，致失去向安全理事會申訴之機會。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二十六日電〕據權威方面透露；美國要求英國禁止印緬鴉片之生產及吸食（合法之醫藥用途不在此例），英方已提出對案，主張由聯合國機構處置有關鴉片生產及私賣之整個問題。英方提議由聯合國機構社會經濟委員會設置一委員會，負責處置此項問題。英方顯欲創設一類似國際聯盟甲鴉片諮詢委員會之機關，以處置有關鴉片之一切問題。美官方對於英國建議自必贊同，但仍以取締來源最爲妥善。美方估計印度年產鴉片五百噸，並謂印度醫藥上所需要之鴉片不過一百噸，其餘均私運出口。據消息靈通方面表示，緬甸之鴉片問題亦殊棘手，英方指出緬甸北部之居民大都煙癮甚深，且常應用於宗敎儀式中，故英人雅不願加以干涉。伊朗及印度爲鴉片之二大產地，英人曾於一九三四年允許在奪回之日軍佔領區內，廢止鴉片國家專賣及禁止鴉片之吸食。就英人而論，此事對於香港及馬來影響最大，預料英人將在該處實踐其諾方。荷印在戰前之情勢並不嚴重，因該處並不生產鴉片，吸食鴉片者計土著不足四萬人及華僑約四萬人。印度未曾被日軍佔領，對於英國所作之諾言似無關係，故英人對於印度鴉片問題，迄無明白表示。</p>

<p>〔聯合社漢城二十六日電〕朝鮮政治舞台上又出現一神秘人物，其身世經歷，傳說紛紜，一如傳奇中所記載者。此即朝鮮共產黨英雄金貽蓀將軍是，韓人知其名者數以千計。據傳，此人曾在中國東北一帶領導遊擊戰抵抗日軍先後十五年。關於此人之一切報道，類多近於神話，雖難予證實，其名已深深印入無數韓人腦海之中，則屬毫無疑問。韓國兒童作兵　之　，竸以扮作金鈄軍為榮。日人欲加逮捕，費巨資殆近百萬元。此人自一九三一年後，曾兩度獲得蘇聯勛軍，據最近未證實消息，彼已自延安到達朝鮮北部蘇聯佔領下之京城，同來者有遊擊隊數千人。當地人士聞其將來漢城，即紛紛組織歡迎團體，惟右派對其回國消息，公開加以嘲笑。金九臨時政府發言人稱，此人久已不在人世，來韓之英雄係屬冒充。據傳現在京城之金貽蓀年事尙經，約在卅三歲至三十七歲之間，懷疑者稱，金氏年齡如此之輕，足以證明其在一九三一年即領導遊擊戰之說，未免失實。朝鮮左傾報人某君今日宣稱，彼曾往京城與金氏會唔四次，並謂金氏現爲朝鮮北部共產黨秘書，隊計劃從事政治活動，金氏儀表非凡，身材高大，爲普通三十五歲之韓人中所僅見。金氏所率領之遊擊隊到韓時，已被蘇軍解除武裝，但許其招集軍隊二十萬人。現可確信者，朝鮮北都左傾份子，咸一致擁護金氏，無論爲眞爲假，爲軍人爲政客，彼終將成爲朝鮮之强有力人物云。</p>

<h3 id="c40">秦淮槳聲渺遠·燈影灰冷　夫子廟刼後風情 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— 本報南京廿一日通訊　周鳳</p>
<p>提起南京，就好像忘不了夫子廟似的，尤其是經過日人燒刧後的夫子廟，引起多少外鄕人的關心。其實夫子廟也確實令人戀念，形形色色，亂雜之中太多了花紋，把一整天的日子劃分成幾個片斷：早晨，多半的南京人，上茶園喝茶去，來一碗豆漿，幾個鴨油酥餅，或者要一盅蜜甜的酒釀圓子，加上二個雞蛋，坐上這麼三二個鐘點。商家的接洽，朋友的閒談，只要在上午，就忘不了夫子廟的茶園。</p>
<p>館子店的好買賣</p>
<p>除了茶園，還有更多的大飯店和小吃館。到了中午，尤其是晚上，塞滿了食客，像是吃了不要付錢的，好在南京是個政治中心，多的是大人先生們。今天你邀客，明天我還請，確實替館子店做了不少的好買賣。飯店門前並列着一輛輛勢利的汽車，玻璃裏襯着某某機關的通行證，獃在寒風裏像在問：「常常到這裏，是上辦公室？這樣黑的天了！」復員，復員，刦後的夫子廟裏，成績斐然可觀！</p>
<p>秦淮河年華老去</p>
<p>夫子廟前面，是一條留着多少膩事艷跡的秦淮河，現在可以划舟的，僅僅從文德橋到淮淸橋的那一段。河水依舊那麼混混沌沌，兩旁頹頹偏偏的房子，更襯出秦淮河的年華已老。那些迷人的畫舫，不堪破壞地披上了一層灰沙，悵悵地泊在河邊，寒冷的天了，歇過了一冬再說。河面靜靜的，偶而在早晨的陽光裏，還有幾樓飄飄忽忽烟雨般的水氣，到底遮掩不了冷寂的凄凉，相形於夏夜的輕顰低笑，弦歌不　，要觸起多少的感嘅。</p>
<p>風流五孫今猶在</p>
<p>「春花秋月何時了」，那裏唱得盡人間的悲歌。一代又一代，以要有衣不得穿暖，食不得求飽的一天，秦淮河旁歌聲永遠那麼的惆悵，少女的靑春，一直在此地消磨，望着落花流水，那裏會想到得自己的天上人間？風流王孫的求歡，要括盡她們的笑臉。人生幾何，難道就給美人與金錢所消磨？</p>
<p>相逢何必要傾軋</p>
<p>刧後的夫子廟，很快地就恢復了原來亂哄哄的一團。有歌塲，有茶園，有飯館，有各式各樣的商店，勝利後更添了不少的舞塲，久不見面的霓虹燈，又閃鑠地耀人眼目，那蕩人心魂的爵士音樂，存心要奪去「依依拉拉」古老的琴聲。同是天涯淪落人，相逢何必要傾軋？</p>
<p>奎光閣寳珠遭刧</p>
<p>先前，秦淮河中，有個茶館，叫奎光閣，據傳亭頂上有顆晶亮的寳珠，閃閃鑠鑠地像顆星，當日本兵燒毀夫子廟後，就掠去這顆寳珠，南京人一提起奎光閣，就替那顆寳珠可惜，據說還不知是那一朝的皇帝所欽賜的呢。總之，奎光閣在河裏的那個亭子毀了，却是鐵一般的事實！</p>
<p>四大商塲的概觀</p>
<p>夫子廟裏有個永安商塲，也是刧毀後新造起來的，外貌活像一家大公司。高高的樓，晶亮的櫉窗，集合了各式各樣的商店，大家像合夥一樣地聚在一起，各管各做自己的買賣。（像上海的「靜安商塲」「新市塲」之類）可是，比上海的造得考究，連走廊上面也蓋着整塊整塊的玻璃窗。南京現在有四大商塲，（中央市塲，復興商塲，健康商塲？永安商塲），建築設備，都相當不錯，外貌也頗壯麗。其範圍和外貌，可與上海的四大公司相媲美。</p>
<p>九流三敎的雜要</p>
<p>夫子廟的一角，是奢侈的，是妖淫的，染上了太多的淫華，是有錢人的遊樂塲。可是，誰又想到另一角的情形，恰恰相反？以前的孔廟，被這次燒刧後，破垣瓦塲，四週矮矮的平房，恢復不了。這個孔廟，僅有一圈圍墻，反是九流三敎的「英雄」們用武之地了，白天一圈一圈塲子的雜要，竪旗杆，說書，彈詞，相聲，看西洋景，賣膏蔣，要刀鎗……那些人一臉的粗率笑容，只要你觸犯他一點，包管他破口就駡。</p>
<p>江湖味懂得甚麼</p>
<p>夜裏，白大的「英雄」看着人家熱鬧了，墨暗裏有一蓋半　的油燈，看相先生拉着遊客的手，相着燈光，看看他的臉，看看他的衣服，看看……於是叫他一聲：「老兄」，接着滔滔不絕地說着過去，未來，哄的大家笑出來，有撤撤腿走了，嘴裏嚕着說：「江湖味，懂點什麼？」然而，只有江湖的一切，大家才願天天圍着這幾個攤頭邊笑着。</p>
<p>姑娘們穿梭往來</p>
<p>武廟舊址的塲地前，是一般「落魄英雄」的遊戲地，他們看見那些年靑的姑娘，只要在此地穿來穿去，他們會經薄地向她調笑，粗氣粗聲地，有時還會勾肩搭背。</p>
<p>泮宮前，廣塲裏，昔日有最下等的妓女在此地拉客，只要你肯「冒險」，唉，說也可憐，多少的苦力在此地找安慰，今雖被警局禁止，偶而還有三個兩個在覓取她們的「所歡」，口裘咕噥着：「我們家去玩玩」……這一角落裏，唉，生的糜費！</p>
<p>南京，壩京是個堂堂皇皇的首都，可是，夫子廟，夫子廟又是南京的最閙區，刧，刧不了南京，刧不了這可憐又可愛的夫子廟！</p>

<p>三代表在北平　（右圖）下機時合影（自右至左）</p>
<p>政府代表：沈毅和藹的鄭介民將軍</p>
<p>美方代表：大使館代辦羅伯遜將軍</p>
<p>共黨代表：落拓不覊的葉劍英將軍</p>
<h3 id="c41">調處部展開工作三代表在北平　本報十八日航訊　文湧寄自故都 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>被派赴北平執行國民政府及共黨共同決定頒佈的停戰令之三代表，於十四日搭機抵達此間。目下停戰委員會已正式設立了執行部，白底黑字長方形的大匾，就掛在協和醫院門首，頗足使故都人士聳動視綫。</p>
<p>這三位代表，可說是目前北京飯店中的貴賓，任何人都寄以無限的熱望。共黨代表住一樓，政府代表住二樓，美方代表住三樓，通宵燈火，可見其工作緊張之一斑。</p>
<p>此次，在三位代表聯合招待平市記者時，美方代表羅伯遜將軍以『一個友好而中立性的觀家家』（羅氏如此說）的地位說：『我所要努力的，就在於執行國民政府及共黨之間已經獲得了的協議』。這正與李宗仁將軍的口胞相似，他說：我國內爭，猶如一個家庭中兩兄弟失了和睦，不煩勞鄰人從旁勸解，日子久了，也自會言歸於好的。不過，經了鄰人的勸解，好起來則比較容易得多。葉劍英將軍爲了這一點，除了表示感激之外，又表示了慚愧。其原因，就是因爲在勸解方面，美國給我們的帮忙實在太多了。</p>
<p>政府代表鄭介民將軍，審視了一下記者所提的書面問題後，便滔滔不絕地給了我們以非常滿意的答復。一眼望去，便可看出他是一位沉毅莊重藹然可親的將軍，並且胸有成竹，精練活潑。鄭將軍圓臉兒，生氣虎虎。身體也很堅挺。他是繼楊宣城担任軍政部第二廳廳長，專司軍事宣傳工作，爲各方所欽仰的人材。他跟葉劍英將軍是廣東同鄕，所不同者，葉將軍多一　黑鬚，是俄國留學生而已。當他跟記者談話時，蔡參謀長文治將軍就坐在他身畔，一聲不響，笑容可掬。此外，隨同來平者，有第二廳，外事局，軍統局，及憲兵司令部各方面調派出來的人員。其中最使記者印象深刻的是担負宣傳重責的季澤晉將軍。他代表政府方面的言諭新聞宣傳，其所處的地位，與代表共黨工作之　澎女士相等。</p>
<p>現在要談到共黨代表葉劍英將軍了，他一到北京，就下榻北京飯店，並立即會見了平市記者。他吿訴記者說：作爲共黨代表的我，從重慶飛到這裏來，也正如我們從延安被派到重慶一樣，就是爲了「修文偃武」，就是爲了要實現和平統一，就是爲了要停止內戰，大家應該在這時候，迎風轉舵，華洋一體轉舵。在答復記者問話時候，龔澎小姐是始終片刻不離左右的。她是那有名的共黨政論家喬木的夫人，英文造詣，據說相當高深，在重慶一向很活躣，担任新華日報記者及共黨國際宣傳工作，曾名噪一時，現在她所担負的工作，是調處部新聞組的共方代表之一員。附帶報道一點葉將軍的履歷：</p>
<p>葉劍英將軍，字宜偉，一九〇三年生於廣東梅縣一個商人之家。雲南講武堂第二期畢業生。曾在福建陳　明部隊供職。後調赴廣州，加入共黨，在黃埔軍官學校當敎官，北伐時，任二十一師師長。一九二九年赴俄。通俄德兩國言語。回國後，任共軍參謀長，共黨政治局委員，抗戰期間任八路軍總參謀長，以迄於今。葉將軍素有落拓不羈的作風。</p>
<p>執行小組，業已分赴各地，積極展開其工作。</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>茲謹隨函附奉文稿一篇。我寫這篇文字是正義的激發，請貴報予以發表，文責可仍由本人自責。萬一「新四軍」明天打進揚州城裏來了，我將仍然承認這是我的文字！王瀚謹上，一月廿三日夜，揚州。</p>
<p>光復後的蘇北，人們萬萬沒有想到，淸江·淮安·寳應·興化·高郵·鹽城·如皋·東台等縣城，會又遭受一次砲火的洗禮和兵獎之災。僥倖沒有讓「新四軍」攻陷的揚州城裏，以及鎭江等地，會像荒年一樣，有逃難的人們躑躪街頭。更意外的，在煇煌的對日英勇抗戰的過程裏，人們未嘗知道過「新四軍」曾攻打高郵·興化·東台，……抗戰結束了，「新四軍」却來攻打這些城池了，還表現了他們的最英勇的戰鬥行爲！「戰士」犧牲的壯烈，動輒號稱死傷數千人。幷且每次都是預先準備好「疊鹹魚」（雜亂地裝載死屍也）的船隻。這種偉大的塲面，在蘇北抗戰史中，頗難找出像樣的紀載的。</p>
<p>「動輒數千人」嗎？蘇北「新四軍」的人數究竟有着幾多呢？</p>
<p>是的，這正是需要鄭重來說明一下的。</p>
<p>每次攻城犧牲的「戰士」，並非「新四軍」的固有部隊，而是臨時在鄉間强拉的壯丁，以及一般老百姓，其中行商和小販皆有，誰碰上了就活該送命，而且靠得住的送命。被驅上火綫了，前面是對平方噴射着火舌的機關槍，後面又是等待張口的機關槍，那是「新四軍」對付所謂「不英勇」退却下來的「歪種」的。</p>
<p>這等人因爲是毫無訓練的，他們並沒有一桿長槍，但攤派的任務却是打頭陣—衝鋒與爬城！每人有手溜彈兩枚，假如說這就是「新四軍」給爬城者的武器，不如說是給爬城者放在身邊或揑在手內壯壯胆子的。這和另一種法術，用棉被數條，浸水後覆於一方桌之上及遮起四周，驅令「打頭陣」者數人頂之前進，並壯其胆子說，這是可以避槍彈的「坦克」。等到一批一批犧牲的時候，那橫豎是他們死活不管的時候了。而每次作戰，這樣犧牲一批批無辜者，用以寒對手的心，减對手的鬥志，使對手的兵士不忍心再射擊這批無辜者，此正是「新四軍」光復以來所用的一種戰術。</p>
<p>「新四軍」指揮人員雖有豪語說：「機關槍一梳子彈五十發，我們用五十一個肉彈和你拚，五十個肉彈犧牲了，你的一梳子彈打完了，我們的第五十一個肉彈奪得你的機關槍了！」</p>
<p>這種豪語，眞恐怕連世界的任何軍事家的豪語也及不上它的雄壯！</p>
<p>可是我們來想想吧：那些一批批犧性掉的無辜，算什麼呢？我想，任何人了解了這種情形以後，一時會說不出什麼淸楚的道理來，然心頭會有無限的悲痛和憤慨吧？！而反對內戰，反對「新四軍」，是心底吶喊的最高聲音。</p>
<p>所以，人們每每因怨恨「新四軍」的「攪亂」行爲，竟會連帶地怨恨國軍爲什麼不能也不管一切地用武力將「新四軍」解決掉。人們知道蘇北現在國軍有的是足够殲滅「新四軍」的兵力，至少攻克江都的幾個隣縣是不成問題的。</p>
<p>政治協商會議的一大寳貴產物！「停戰命令」，明文是「十三日夜一時」（？）全國應一律停止衝突。便是十四日晚，邵伯的前綫上有這樣一件小小趣事：（這裏用趣事一詞，我得承認我是患有歇斯底里症的人了！）是日淸晨，「新四軍」在一棵大樹梢上，高地張起「奉命停戰」等字條，國軍見了落得相安無事了。那知到晚來，沒有防備，「新四軍」竟來一個突擊。戰果是：國軍死傷百餘人。這幾天，「新四軍」則在大舉圍攻六合</p>
<p>縣城，今天（請注意：今天是離「伴戰命令」實施日整整一旬了，）的消息，「新四軍』又在　攻鄰縣泰州，（即泰縣）。因爲「新四軍」不守法文，爲防其遺使便衣歐再作「混城」活動（前次發生過了。）揚州城裏這兩天在忙着整理保甲，嚴查戶口，「居住證」將又或爲人們行路務必執有的護照，新名稱是「居民證」當然是要重行向警察局申請具領的。三百元左右的照相費，及買「申請書」的費用二十五元，在富有者自然毫不成問題，可是普通人家，有六個人口的，意外的二千餘元的開支，當此廢曆年關迫近，用項繁多的時候，想想便不由的要發恨！「新四軍眞坑死人」一句話，便到處流露在人們嘴邊！</p>
<p>每晚十時禁街，軍政等人員非因公一概不準通行，又軍政機關及任何居民人家，概不得讓外人留宿，報戶口者例外。這些都是當局最近爲防範「新四軍」混城的舉指。</p>
<p>在親戚朋友家裏，你每每可以遇到來自興化，高郵，鹽城，淸江等地的流亡者，旅館裏自然不用說的，還有「××縣流亡靑年招待所」，那裏則全是因新四軍攻陷他們的故鄕而避難揚州</p>
<p>又艱於生活的靑年。和他們攀談攀談，你除了不得不相信許多人談的「新四軍」的攪亂及罪孽行爲全屬事實。最明顯的，你立刻會覺得，他們對「新四軍」的憤慨是更大的，也最深刻不過的。譬如說吧：他們認爲「停止衝突命令頒布以後，「新四軍」旣然依舊向國軍攻擊，參加政治協商會議的共產黨代表周恩來等，國府很可以不承認他們的代表資格，至少要毛澤東先生負責任！他們有這樣的了解：蘇北「新四軍」的組成份子，好多原是地痞流氓</p>
<p>之類，更有偽軍改編的，「中共中央」的命令，根本就不能普遍下達。而這些份子，往往當攻陷一城鎭時，攪着一票便「逃之夭夭」，「新四軍」為了湊補人數，又不得不補充些莠民進去，這樣，老百姓可糟糕透了！憤慨得最火的要算是：『讓我們根據「漢奸懲治條例」來檢舉，「新四軍」的行爲看有何理由辯說成不是漢奸行爲？反抗政府，擅自擴軍，擁兵黷武，拉攏敵寇，收編僞軍，强徵壯丁，發行「抗幣」，擅設政府，禍害人民，………』這和昨天（廿二日）報載：滬上記者視察團致政治協商會議政府代表及共黨代表之電文，「—和平實現，團結成功，全國人民，逖聽之餘，無不額手稱慶……」云云的看法，適成反此例。</p>
<p>人們都奇怪滬上的某些報紙，竟還爲共產黨的許多詭辯作帮腔，而許多報紙的評論，對於共產黨部隊罪大惡極的行爲事實，鮮有澈底的批評，迎平實的報導文字也很少。許多副刊上更看不見反映或評述共黨行爲的文字。他們的這種不滿，我得說多少，未免嫌偏狹了，祇想到自已的一面。隊如美國Dale　Carnegic說過的，「人們頭頸上生了一粒瘡，比非洲的大地震還使他關心。」他們沒有想到：第一，上海和蘇北本就是十四層大厦與茅屋對比的兩個世界；第二，上海是國際的都市，人們注意的問題是闊大的，進步的，國際性的，因爲人們的視野是闊大的，進步的，國際性的呀！</p>
<p>但是，當看到滬上記者組視察團將來蘇北視察的消息，他們又快慰了！他們在引頸期待着視察團的早日到來，還抱了不勝歡迎的態度及無任感激的心懷！</p>

<p>— 楊幼炯</p>
<p>民主政治之實施，已爲我全國朝野一致努力的鵠的。但我們知道民主政治應以理智作根據的，祗有政府與人民以理智爲基礎時，民主憲政才能遵循一定的軌道進行，而國內政治纔能發生正常的適當關係。由於這一個前提，我願國人以理智來正確的認識今後國內政治變動的眞相。</p>
<p>多黨的政黨政治在中國又將開始實現了。多黨政治在國人眼中原非新奇的東西；民國元年到十年之間中國也曾經實行了類似歐西的多黨政治，民元國民黨在北京發布的宣言就說：「一國政黨之興也，祗宜兩黨對峙，不宜小羣分立」。國民黨固未嘗不主張政黨政治，但因民國成立後之十年中大小政團不下數十，共結果無裨國政，終於無形消滅。我們推源其故，由於各派政團祗在爭取現實的權利，並無永久的政網，未能得到廣大民衆　擁護。英美的政黨，遵循已定的憲政常軌，共奉一種主義—自由主義，祗是在政策上鬥智爭雄，以求取得民衆的擁護，獲得政權。自從兩黨更替執政的法治常軌確立後，以武力爭奪政權的局面，就永久消除。我們基於這一點上，對於以後的政黨政治能够在　國父手訂之建國程序與全國民衆一致擁護的最高建國原則—三民主義的準繩之下，爲民主政治之推進而致力，特致其無窮的希望。</p>
<p>但是我們回顧到二十年前的政黨鬥爭史，對於今後的政黨政治不能不喚醒國民，提高警覺，而予以密切的注意。政黨的存在，必須以政見相結合，而不以對人的問題相結合。二十年前政黨敗壞的史跡，似應不致爲國人所忘懷。化黨爲朋，固非政黨的正當途徑；而今日結一黨，明日立一社，徒以爭取政權爲事者，也必爲國人所不容。我們所希望於未來的各派政黨者，必須有鮮明的主張，有建國的至誠，並確有多數的黨員，如此始能促進民治。一黨多黨之爭，在中國政壇上亦曾發生不少的論戰，但不可忽視國家建國的傳統，時代的精神，以及民衆的傾向。今日諭政者動輒以國民黨一黨當政爲詬病，即隔靴搔癢的國外人士亦多不明瞭，我們願以國民客觀的立塲，略一叙中華民國建國之傳統，更希望國內外論政之士，勿抹煞我革國先烈熱血所換來的民國建國史於不顧。中國國民黨者是建造中華民國之革命的政黨，五十年來的中華民國直接間接都在國民黨的三民主義之孕育與創建之中，猶之蘇維埃聯　是蘇聯共產黨之所創建與治理一樣。我們旣同意蘇聯共產黨因革命環境之需要，而長久實行其一黨專政，則對於中國國民黨之根據建國程序，逐步實現其還政於民之宏願，固無所用共非議。至於「以黨訓政」一層，祗是一種建國途徑中的一個過渡時期。我們試詳考中華民國創始者的孫中山先生之遺敎，及中國國民黨五十年來之文獻，無一有永久把據政權而不實行還政於民之主張，則今日之諭一黨專政者，對於此點更應有所認識。即以「訓政」而論，國民黨之「訓政」與蘇聯共黨之「專政」不同。所謂「階級獨裁」與「一黨專政」，其精神與目的，乃以政權始終專于一階級或一黨為歸宿；而國民黨之訓政，其精神與目的，實以政權付諸國民爲其最終的目的，其旨趣與歸宿適與專政相反。民國二十四年美國哈佛大學敎授霍爾康（Holcombe）來我國講學，對于國民黨的訓政，有精確的說明。氏以爲「在軍政時期以後，憲政時期以前，有一個訓政時期，乃極合中國的需要。在這個時期中，可以養成許多政治上的習慣，累積着許多關於國家基本制度的先例，成爲新中國的憲法，結果是行得通的，適合國情的」。賀氏的話，最能代表西洋政治學者客覜的見解。我們希望國內外人士勿再以此爲攻擊國民黨的口實。十五年來國民政府信誓旦且，宣示終必還政於民，祗以日寇的長略下，國內的不安，致延長其期限，本年五五召開國民大會，國民黨還政於民之宏願得償，建國初志自可昭告中外。惟望國人對此一建國論據有正確的了解，而國民黨黨員應堅守其黨的一貫建國的誓願，勿自棄其所信。此其一。</p>
<p>其次，三民主義者，非國民黨一黨的主義，乃中華民國建國的最高原則。民國十七年頒行的「訓政綱領」及「國民政府組織法」是正式以文書宣布「本革命之三民主義五權憲法建設中華民國」之開端。此後「訓政時期的法」，「抗戰建國網領」，以及尙待實施的「中華民國憲法草案」又　是規定以三民主義爲建國的最高準經。自是三民主義在法律上已搆成建國的主義，實爲中華民國政權發動的原動力。全國國民對於上述已經頒布的基本法律，旣搆成一種權力服從的關係，對於三民主義在法律上更有信仰與服從的義務。而在各黨派方面，過去及現在亦均明白表示遵奉三民主義爲建國的主義，則今後各黨派自應在三民主義的建國最高原則之下從事活動，猶如英美兩國政黨都在信奉民主的大原則下從事活動。換言之，各黨派的活動不得違反三民主義，或企圖推翻三民主義，亦猶之英美以自由主義立國，英美的主要政黨不得反對自由主義一樣。因此，無論在英美，或是在我國，祗有一種立國的主義，沒有一個國家有兩種並行不悖的立國主義，這是現代國家所共有的特徵。過去中國的政黨多沒有認識這個基本原則，於是各種主義紛至杳來，　成中國政治長期的混亂。今日各黨派表示遵奉三民主義爲共有的主義，是一大進步。我願國人以此爲各黨派活動的是非之試金石。祗有在立國原則三民主義之下，各黨派才有合法的地位。此其二。</p>
<p>至於今後的中國，不諭其實行一黨制或多黨制，在憲政實施後國民黨還政於民，雖居於普通政黨，然仍不失其領導建國的首要地位。因爲各黨派旣奉行三民主義，則產生三民主義創建民國的國民黨，無論在朝在野，仍當本其一貫建國的志願，領導國民，督促三民主義之實現。所應討論者，則中國今後是否採兩黨對峙，還是各黨聯合，此一問題，應値得國民的重視。五權憲法之制度，實大異於英美制度，它旣非責任內閣制，又非總統制，而是以國民大會爲中心的政權與治權分立的一種民選政府制。儘管各黨派在國民大會中多所活動，但似乎很難有一黨可以包辦政權。作者以爲今後各黨分立的局勢造成之後，不外兩種趨勢：一是以國民黨與共產黨爲中心，各吸收其他黨派以成兩大黨對立；一是林林總總的各黨派分立，不是今天喊聯合，便是明天鬧拆夥。凡此趨向如何，都要看今後局勢的演變，但無論如何，全體國民必是今後政治趨向的抉擇者。望國民先認淸政局之眞相，繼則發揮國民之威力，督促各黨派堅守憲　之常軌，勿得有毀法亂紀之行爲。必如是，憲政百年之始基，始能奠定於全國國民雙肩之上。</p>

<p>中國紡織建設公司將於今日起，再接管與紡織事業有關之工廠十六家，其中有毛織廠六家，計宏康·永典·華興·中和·公大·等五廠，及上海第六廠。染織廠七家，計一達·中華·惠美·華强·興華·桂州·美華。製麻工廠三家，計日華一二廠，上海一二廠，東亞。今日起分別由經濟部特派員辦事處移交。惟大部人事未予更動，祗將各廠改隸紡建公司系統之下，俾統一管理。此外尙有敵僞針織廠廿餘單位，可由該公司接收。惟各針織廠大多規模較小，在管理上殊多不便，故接管與否，正在考慮中，大致一部份將撥歸民營。</p>

<h3 id="c49">電力公司當局表示　正當要求樂予考慮　勞方不堅持到廠談判 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕電力公司工測僵持已達五日，昨日因職工代表不再堅持必須資方蒞廠談判，故工潮解決漸有轉機。惟職工代表堅持不再與原代表羅根（英人）及陶英傑協議，因工方認彼等二人蒙蔽大班法雷斯。昨日該廠招待記者，請記者將此意轉達法雷斯，俾直接之談判得能迅速進行。</p>
<p>勞資雙方即可會商</p>
<p>記者昨曾訪該公司正大班霍浦金，據其表示，彼願代表公司當局負責宣吿，職工方面之任何正常要求，無不樂於考慮接受，類如解雇工人之復職，待遇之調整等等。惟此等條件彼亦僅於報上見到，並未接得職工方面正式之請求，故殊感惶惑不解。此點待今明雙方當局直接會見後，當可各自瞭解對方眞意之所在。</p>
<p>職工代表有所解釋</p>
<p>職工代表等昨又言：彼等並無任何過奢之要求，故願資方勿循討價還價之慣例予以减削。至前所以堅持談判地點必須在廠內者，係因多次依照資方出外談判，朱獲要領，故全體如此要求來廠，使彼等能明瞭談判之經過情形，獲知代表之是否盡職，並遇有任何爭執時，可隨時召集全體大會討論，以決定是否接受或拒絕。並鄭重聲明工會理事沈涵絕無偸電情事，其原因爲沈之鄰居歐亞理髮店，電綫損壞，擅自接在沈之電表上，事實上即使獲沈同意，亦仍照章付費，故偸電罪名根本不能成立。</p>
<p>對調解人希望諒解</p>
<p>關于被解雇之十職工，均非臨時工人，且有兩人一已服務廿餘年，另一亦已有十年歷史，故際此工作緊張之時，資方實無藉口「不需要」而隨便予以解雇之理。關於負責調解之市黨部委員王先靑，彼等深感滿意，挾持王氏及妨害其自由之舉，謂可以生命担保其必無，惟因王氏勸吿先復工後談判一點，未予照辦，或使王氏深感不快，希望王氏諒解。</p>
<p>百貨公司尙待調解</p>
<p>本市永安，先施等九大百貨公司職工三千餘人，要求加薪未遂，乃於二十三日起開始怠工，迄今已歷五日，雖迭經當局調解，仍未獲解決。昨日上午十時社會局調解科張振遠科長又邀集勞資雙方代表磋商，勞方之最低薪津要求由三萬五千元减爲三萬四千五百元（供膳食），資方則根據工資評議會之決定最低薪津為三萬地，膳食自理，如膳食仍由公司供給，需扣除飯資七千五百元，則最低薪給爲二萬二千五百元，後經張科長分別勸導，資方允提高至二五千元（供膳），勞方則仍堅持三萬四千五百元（供膳），相持不決，乃定於今日下午一時再行調解。</p>
<p>美軍司機昨日復工</p>

<p>編者先生：鄙人鑒於科學的重要性，對科學發生很大的興趣，我的腦中設計一部不用燃料藉氣力的原動機，根據我的理解，是能够成功的。但是，未經過實地試騐，總歸尙欠把握。還有待尋材料而研究的十餘種，試驗是經濟力不許可，而所處的環境，是不合我旨趣的，亦不能充份找尋材料，因而我的難題就不易解決，即影饗做其他的事也無心力，簡單的說，實在惑覺苦悶得很。現在我想投到適合旨趣的環境中去，研究試騐，而又不得門徑。敬請先生指導介紹，俾開茅塞，使能加速進行研究。同時，又連想到，害我這同樣苦悶病者，決不祇我一人，而且，一定很多。殺好，先生能爲吾等迫於經濟，環境，日坐愁城的有志科學者，發出有力的呼籲，請當局設一個俱備科學參考資料的書籍及供給試騐儀器的科學試騐硏究所，俾使吾等的想像，圖表，去研究試騐，這是最渴望的，特此奉托，順頌　撰安　高成功上</p>
<p>（編者按）高先生：像你這樣有科學頭腦，有進取精神的靑年，我是十二分欽佩的。你說沒有經濟力，沒有實騐所也確是不易發展你的懷抱。中國是科學落後的國家，但現當建國開始時期，正需要大量堅忍刻苦的靑年，齊向科學方而去努力。八年抗戰，原有學術上的設備，已被敵人摧毀殆盡—相信以後會慢慢地建設起來，千萬別性急，勿消極。至於你理想中的「原動機」，最好先繪圖樣，詳加說明，送來讓我介紹給物理學者審核，倘使眞能成爲事實，不愁沒有試騐製作的地方，你以爲怎樣？</p>

<p>〔本報訊）全上海的進出口商，都在等候着發表外匯率。</p>
<p>最早接到外商定貨的是中國的藥材行，在剛剛勝利之後，上海物價普遍下跌，然而國藥中的所謂「營口貨」却是例外，因爲澳洲有去路。所謂「營口貨」，是因爲在營口轉運而得名的，多數是東北各省的出產，不想勝利之後，東北的秩序一直沒有恢復，營口更成爲一個重要的軍事據點，於是貨源斷絕，根本連本街需要都無法供給，自然更談不上出口了。但藥材商人却表示，在外匯率沒有確定之前，他們本來就不願擔了極大的風險來做出口賣買。</p>
<p>美商進出口商行之中，海寗洋行可以做一個代表。他們在戰前出品的美女牌糖果，固然早已在上海頗負盛名，但他們在我國各地搜羅鷄蛋，運往歐美（尤其是英國），却歷史更久，規校更大，最近又在美國定購了大批白報紙，第一批在下月就可以到上海。現在，該行已經復業，美籍負實人海寗生氏也已經到達上海，但是業務却還是不易推進。鷄蛋最大的來源是津浦綫一帶，而津浦綫一帶目前尙無法派人前去收購。紙張雖然不久即可源源而來，但是在外匯率沒有發表之前，他們也覺得不易定出一個最確當的價格。</p>
<p>怡和洋行在戰前長專門「出產」公共租界工部局的總董的，在外人握有領事裁判權時代，他們的勢力眞是灸手可熟。現在重慶的第二支店，已遷到上海，但第一，他們和太古洋行一樣，內河航行的權利取消了，以前膾灸人口的「太古船」「怡和船」都將成爲歷史名詞。他們說，「我們有船，有人，而中國目前正感缺乏交通工具和人才，總希望還能給我們一點機會。」怡和的出口部中，蠶絲是很主要的一門，戰後已經運出了一些，但是他們拿到一塊美金之後，祇能在上海中國銀行「借」五百元法幣，而且手續相當麻煩。如果純粹從牟利的目光看來，把蠶絲運到美國還不如在上海脫手有利，因爲上海的絲價已經相當高，而成交之後，可以收到全部的貨欲，以供週轉。普通人也許以爲，國產貨物在外國拋售之後，也許就可以用這筆款子買洋貨回來，那麼不但可以免受外匯率延不發表的影響，而且獲利更可豐厚，但是，那位怡和洋行的高級職員吿訴我，這是政府所不許的。他還說，進口交易也極為困難，第一是外國的船隻目前也受統制，第二是英美銀行裏的資金至今還凍結着，你想買東西也沒有錢。（平齊）</p>

<p>〔新滬社訊〕自物價高度飛漲以來，滬地失學孩童，年見增加，學校旣不能無理增加學費收入，彌補不足，於是經濟遂處於垂危的困境。另有一般祇圖私利之學店老關，對於敎育事業，未有深切興趣，及眞實認識敎育原理，鑒於敎育事業已不如昔日之可獲厚利，又不背减却一己之優裕生活，乃惟有改弦易輒，從减薪裁員方面着想。最近滬上有少數私小校長，儼然以資本家的手段，逼壓敎師，使爲神聖事業而工作的敎師，被無辜裁撤而失業者有之。至於待遇菲薄，不能維持個人生活，差不多已成普遍事實。這種情形如長此以往，則眞置敎員之生活保障於何地。本市小學敎師聯合進修會，有鑒及此，特於昨日（廿七日）假山海關路育才中學，舉行小學敎師生活保障促進會，開第一次理事會議，將草擬文稿，向各界作普遍之呼籲云。</p>

<p>生產建設特輯</p>
<h3 id="c86">發刋旨趣 <a href="#c86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>抗戰勝利以後，各項建設，就需要積極展開，幾個月來，因爲一切恢復正常，需要相當的時間，截止目前爲止，尙沒有一點具體的成效。</p>
<p>然而我們決不能等待，決不能遲延，要加緊工作，努力前進。在各項建設之中，經濟建設，是各項建設的重點，而且是一切建設的先務，我們要促成經濟建設，那末從事生產是刻不容綏的。蔣主席在最高經濟委員會中曾經說：「在進行這種重要的建設及發展工作的時候，本委員會必須認淸我國的問題，決不能祇希望別的國家在帮忙解決，我們必須自已帮助自己。」所謂自己帮助自己，不外乎「自力更生」，要「自力更生」。那末唯有努力生產，由生產而進入建設的階段，是最合理的辦法。</p>
<p>目前從事生產，困難正多，問題重重。但惟其如此，就需要共同來討論，研究，使在千艱萬辛之中，打開一條路；在千頭萬緒中，理出一根絲。所以在這時候，每星期發刊一次生產建設特輯，正可以使從事生產的工業界，發表意見，供各方研究參考；叙述困難，使政府從事扶助；介紹世界趨勢，俾能策勵前進。本刊的使命，就在這三點：但要完成本刊的使命，還需要讀者的合作與匡正。</p>
<h3 id="c87">錢昌照先生談：工業建設的作風 <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— 費文</p>
<p>最近資源委員會副主任委員錢昌照先生發表談話，說工業建設的作風，應該「大·快·早。」他解釋關於「大」的一點，我國過去建設太零星，以後應該大規模的把新中國建設起來。有大手筆，才能迎合大時代。應該用人的時候就得用，應該用錢的時候就得用。關於「快」的一點，我國過去建設太慢，環境固然不好，而一般人怕負責，不求有功，但求無過，也是一個極重要的原因。以後負經濟建設責任的人一定要有擔當勇往直前，在經濟建設的過程中，即使有些疏誤，政府和社會應該原諒。關於「早」的一點，我國過去建設往往推動得太晚，左顧右慮，不敢開始。因之錯過時間。以後建設一定要有嘗試精神，一件事情有六七成把握就得推動。十全十美的環境，是永遠不會來的。</p>
<p>錢先生所說的大·快·早三點，事實上實在是一個整個的計劃問題。有了計劃，就可以易於實施，中國人做事最大的錯誤，就是沒有具體的計劃，在目前這個時候，從事計劃，更要配合環境。有了計劃以後，就可以用大·快·早的三種方式實行。</p>
<p>關於整個計劃一點，正可以參考最近宋院長為中國紡織建設公司所發表的書面意見中關於日本在國外紗布市塲情形，原文說：「在此次抗戰以前，日本在國外紗布市塲，每年約有美金三萬萬元，其所用原料，大部均由我國獲取，日本紡織業各集團在其本國，自己對自己，固然必有競爭，但對國外，則取一致的行動，無論在運輸方面，金融方面，保險方面，政府及各項企業組織，組成一體，如此盈虧係屬整個計算，故能具有這樣的成功？」</p>
<p>宋院長所說的情形，正是目前我國工業界應該辦到的情形，照着那種情形實行起來，就可以採取「大·快·早」的作風而獲得成功。</p>
<h3 id="c88">建設輕工業與木紗綫業 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— 羅立羣</p>
<p>本刊爲使讀者明瞭各廠情况起見，每期介紹一　於工廠方面過去的努力和今後的方　。本期特請中國飛綸廠主持人羅立羣先生撰文說明木紗業的情况—編者</p>
<p>一·建國與國家工業化</p>
<p>自從抗戰勝利以來，應該迎頭幹去的工作，就是使國家工業化，在進步的國家裏，高速度的工業設備，已經進展到原子時代，但我國因爲戰事關係，連一點點微弱的工業基礎也被破壞了。爲今後百年大計，我們實在應該立刻開始努力於國家工業化的任務。</p>
<p>二·重工業與輕工業</p>
<p>國家工業化的建設，可以分爲國防工業和民生工業二方面，國防工業是重工業，如造船·鐵路·航空·汽車·鍊鋼等，需要龐大的資本，豐富的資源和傑出的人才，有待於政府的推動和盟邦的協助。民生工業是輕工業，如紡織·製綫造紙等類，就我國民族資本的力量比較容易成就，所以在我們從事工業者的立塲，最切要的工作，就是先就本位努力從事輕工業的建設。以我國人口之多，消耗量之大，可以先做到自給自足，然後再向外發展，所以紙要努力做去，中國輕工業的前途是未可限量的。</p>
<p>三·從紡織業論木紗業的重要</p>
<p>在一般民生工業之中，紡織業可以說是最重要的，因爲紡織業可以解決人生四大要素之一—衣—的。要製或一件衣服，就少不了綫。在手工業時代，我們有國產的絲綫和土紗可用，所以木紗並不爲人重視。但是製衣的技術是已進展不用手製而利用縫紉機，同時因爲都市工業的發達，西式衣服，逐漸普遍，木紗就成爲製衣的必需品，牠的使用從製衣業達到每一個家庭，銷路廣大，因此在戰前英國製的練條牌和俄國製的地球牌，行銷各地，大量輸入，即在窮鄕僻壤，也是家喩戶曉。</p>
<p>四·國貨萌芽</p>
<p>在民國十四五年的時候，因為練條牌銷路的廣大，逐漸引起國人注意，起而製造，但因爲國貨木紗業的資力設備原料種種不及舶來品相繼失敗。</p>
<p>中國飛綸製綫廠適在十六年創立起來，與外貨抗爭，那時候飛輪牌在市塲上很爲人信仰，逐漸挽回國貨木紗業的頹勢，不意綿華洋行藉外人在華特權，在上海設廠製造福桃牌木紗，與飛輪　競銷，挾其雄厚資力以買一羅送二打的傾銷政策爲掠奪市塲的手段，予國貨業輪牌以嚴重的壓力。當時飛輪廠雖在資力懸殊的劣勞下，毫不却步，同時筆者特到華北東北廣港等地考察，另闢銷路維持生產，一方而不斷在技術上予以改進，做種種準備工作。</p>
<p>五·國貨崛起時期</p>
<p>國貨木紗業在一度沉寂之後，到二十七年歐戰風雲日益緊張，外貨來華漸稀，迨大戰爆發，南洋僑商，激於愛國熟忱，紛紛來滬採辦國貨，予國貨木紗業以重振的機會，飛綸廠在十餘年埋頭硏究的苦幹工作下出品技術的改進，己不讓外貨，生產設備，也日就充實，因爲生產設備工作的成就，大爲僑商歡迎，銷路在南洋各島之新加坡，爪哇，婆羅洲，蘇門答臘，暹邏，緬甸，越南，更遠及南美等處，大有供不應求之勢，聲譽可與練條牌媲美，那時候，不但是飛綸廠，其他製綫　廠，也佔了僑商之惠，呈顯着蓬勃的氣象。</p>
<p>六·在困難中救生存</p>
<p>國貨木紗業正在生機活躍的時候，太平洋戰事發生，南洋各地銷路驟遭阻斷，那時國內也因爲戰區日益擴大，日寇厲行封鎖政策，接着僞政府收買紗布，國貨木紗業受到銷路與原料的雙重摧殘，都抱着消極主義，認爲已陷絕境，紛紛停閉或改營他業，那時候飛綸廠當然也免不了同樣的遭遇，同樣厄運，但是絕不悲觀，一方面收縮生產，一方面在本市發動進展，努力推銷，終因爲品質精良，首先推進到永安先施新新中國國貨等公司，繼而擴展到各華洋百貨號，不到一年，在全市的各處都可見到飛輪牌木紗，雖不能如出口南洋時期的繁榮，但在本市的地位也可以佔着首席了。</p>
<p>同時除苦心維持固有地位，更默默地擴展生　　　備，購置廠基，添設自製木　　　，自備染色，並預置拚綫　筒子車，寳塔筒子車及自動車等精密機械，希望在抗戰勝利後成爲國內唯一設備完美的製綫廠。</p>
<p>七·今後的工作與任務</p>
<p>在抗戰勝利以後，生活水準自必相當提高，從前爲了生活爲了節省物資，穿着破黃衣服，旣在我們是應該換衣服的時候了。同時國家的建設，也需要製綫業的努力，所以製綫的飾途，可以說是方興未艾。</p>
<p>八·出口貿易與洋貨的競爭</p>
<p>我們建設輕工業，不應以自給自足爲滿足，應該爲國家爭回已經失去的金錢，爲國家奠下一塊富强的基石，所以我們要注意出口貿易，南洋各地，便是我們爭取出口貿易最好的對象，因爲南洋僑胞在外經商，愛國熱忱，較國內尤强，而且南洋地廣人衆，需要股切，所以祇要品質優良不雖獲得發展。</p>
<p>在國內我們有兩種希望，一方面是要注意外國的再輸入，我們必須努力品質的改良，使可與外國相媲美，一方面是希望國人要愛護國人經營的廠商的出品，使國貨可以廣泛的行銷，而發揚光大，結果還是國人自食其利的。</p>
<h3 id="c89">TVA組織可取的地方 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— 王鸎</p>
<p>TVA就是美國泰納西河管理德局Tennessee　Valley　Authrity的簡稱，該局劍設於十二年前，是美國高瞻遠囑的大政治家故羅斯福總統施政中卓越成就之一，牠非但復活了美國一片荒而未治的宵源，拯救了美國經濟的恐慌，並在這次大戰中，貢獻其民主國兵工廠的偉大。</p>
<p>我國揚子江三峽水力發電的計劃，已在進行實施之中，牠的前途，對於中國未來的工業化方面，和人民生活財富的命運關係，非常重大。</p>
<p>對於TVA的組織方面，有二點是值得特別提出，並且可以作爲一般工業的參考的。就是該局在董事局下面，設顧問及秘書和總經理，而在總經理下面，設宣傳總長和預算總長。再在下面設立各個工作部門。</p>
<p>關於宣傳和預算兩方面，該局特設立總長，可見重視之一斑，這一點正是中國一般工業界所忽略的。</p>
<p>中國的工業界，向來忽視宣傳，以爲宣傳並不是重要的事，即以一般工廠謝絕參觀一點而論，就可說明對於宣傳工作的忽略。一個工廠，絕對沒有什麼秘　可以保守或值得保持，工廠的長處，正可以供外界或同業參考，這樣纔會有進步，而且，因為要公開，就非處理得井井有條不可，所以今後的工業界，應該歡迎參觀，接受外界的批評。</p>
<p>同時宣傳的工作，可以分爲對外和對內兩方面講，對外的宣傳，就是說明某一種工業的需要和價值，使社會注意，使社會同情；對內方面，可以使職工們明瞭他們所參加的工作是有意義的，有價值的。在內外一致的情形之下，就可以有迅速發展，而且宣傳也完全以事實做根據，要有好的宣傳，就非有良好的事實表現不可，良好的事實表現，就是進步。</p>
<p>關於預算一　，對於事業的成敗，關係非常密切，但中國一般工業，祗有估計，沒有預算，即使有預算也是局部的預算，因此決算與預算終究相差多少，也無從研究。</p>
<p>有了預算，就可以　成具體的計劃，譬如某一項計劃要在五年中完成就成爲一個五年計劃，這五年計劃，就是預算工作的一部份。</p>
<p>而且預算和宣傳，更可以相輔而行，根據預算，從事實傳，預算和宣傳就成爲整個組織的靈魂，再由各部份分工合作，自然進行可以順利，所以對於TVA這一點可取的地方，是值得效法的。</p>
<h3 id="c90">方興未艾的內衣業 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— 傅良駿</p>
<p>說起內衣業，歷史並不長，因爲中國人開始穿世界裝，還是最近十幾年來，方始逐漸風行的。在穿中裝的時候，對於內衣，並不十分講究，也用不到用縫機縫紉。內衣業的剏始，也和其他行業一般，是從極低微的地位逐漸擴展的，最初時候，祗要有一二個人，買了原料，從事裁剪·縫紉，就可以出貨，根本談不上什麼品質和標準，因此從事內衣製造的人，並不會具備遠大的目光和充分的學識。</p>
<p>然而時代是在進展的，由於各方面需要的日益廣大。內衣的生產量就逐漸增進；由於社會大衆鑒別力的一點點堅强，內衣的製造就要逐漸注意技術和標準。</p>
<p>回憶十幾年前創辦新光標準內衣廠的時候，無非因爲市上需要有較好的襯衫，就以業餘的時間來經營，因爲一方面需要日多，同時因爲注重質料，所以組織逐漸擴大，行銷逐漸普遍，結果內衣方面，也自成一業，在最盛的時候，同業的數目，共有一百幾十家。</p>
<p>內衣事業，到了目前的地步，已經爲各界所認識，認爲是一種新穎而可爲的事業。在剏始時到目前爲止，也曾經過許多次的困難和挫折，但每經一次困難，更加强了前進的毅力，因爲任何事業，都是不能直線發展的。</p>
<p>以新光標準內衣廠而論，在抗戰開始的時候，已經行銷南洋各地，在那裏佔居優秀的地位，但在太平洋戰事爆發以後，交通斷絕，就不得不在本國行銷，同業之中所受的影響，雖不若新光之大，但處境正是相同。接着而來的，就是棉布的收　，使生產幾乎完全停頓。</p>
<p>本來經營事業，有兩種方法，一種是適應環境，另一種是創造環境，在前途茫茫的時候，唯有創造環境，方能够克服一切困難，當收買棉布實施之後，爲了要完成預期的目的，於是不惜任何阻礙，建設新光標準內衣染織整理廠，使原料可以自供自給，因此品質更有把握，產量更無問題，而社會因此對於內衣一業有更進一步的認識；這一點，同業的努力，也是重要的因素。</p>
<p>至於今後的內衣業，我以爲正是方興未艾，因爲穿着世界裝的人將日益增多，祇要質與量能够兼顧並進，在國內的銷路，一定日增月盛。同時對外出口，也是大有可爲，因爲「衣」是人生四大要素之一，最近宋院長在滬發表書面談話，說到政府責成中國紡織建設公司，在短期間內領導紡織事業，同時由招商局及其他中國輪船公司國外航綫，國家銀行之外匯銀行，以及我國各保險公司共同協助，俾能獲得日本以前在國外之每年三萬萬元美金的紗在市塲。</p>
<p>製造內衣，不但需要紗布做原料，而且內衣的售價之中，尙包括製成內衣時的勞工的工資，因此如果以內衣出口，不但可以獲得紗布上應得的潤潤，更可以向國外獲取中國勞工所需的工資，所以內衣事業，如果能與各方面配合起來，前途是相當光明的，值茲申報創刊生產建設周刊，編者向我徴稿，用述梗槪，與同業共勉。</p>
<h3 id="c91">胡西園先生談工業界情況 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>本刊爲使各方面知道工業界的一切情形起見，預備經常和工業界接觸，聽取意見，日前特專訪方自後方來滬的胡西園先生。胡先生在民國二十六年戰事方起的時候，就把工廠移到四川，在二星期前，方始來滬，實在是去得最早，來得最遲，因此對於後方在抗戰中的工業界的一切困苦，身歷其境，知道得最爲詳細。</p>
<p>我們用談話的方式，從在抗戰期間的後方工業界，說到今後工業界的展望，以及工業界所期望於社會人士的各占。現在特把胡先生所發表的意見，歸納為下列各　。</p>
<p>抗戰期間的後方工業界。</p>
<p>在抗戰期間，許多工廠隨着政府移到大後方去，一般人的意思，是要把他們的力量，貢獻給政府，以增强抗戰的力量。因此很有許多人才，到大後方去埋頭苦幹。有直接參加抗戰工作的，如製造軍需品等；有間接參加抗戰工作的，如儘量利用代替品等（例如燈泡上所用的銅，可以作爲製作彈壳之用，就設法用磁質的燈頭）。同時因爲物質的缺乏，一切事務的進行要比平時費力十倍。譬如因為煤的缺乏，就不得不集合幾家工廠到產煤區去直接遝煤；有許多工程方面本來要用金屬品的，不得不用木材代替，到幾百哩以外的森林裘去選取木材。凡是能够設法用代替品的，都用代替品，例如以松節油代替松香水，用人造汽油代替煤氣，這樣的例如舉不勝舉，因此工業界祇求能够應付環境，不能再在技術上求進步。但由於這一種環境的支配，却打破了一般人墨守舊法牢不可破的惡習慣。以前有許多工程師製造貨品，如非要指定一種出品不可，即使同是英國出品，更換了一個牌子，他們就不願意應用，但在抗戰期間，根本沒有外國貨可用，就把目光移到中國所有的物資，加以利用</p>
<p>勝利後的工業破產</p>
<p>在抗戰初期，一般工廠，都按照着正軌經營，希望在經營之餘，能够獲得合法的利潤，但是由於物資態用愈少，又因爲通貨膨脹，物價一天天的高起來，於是在帳面上的數字，日益龐大，實際上工廠的存底却愈弄愈薄弱。本來可以製造一百種貨品的，等到貨品出售以後，祇能補進八十件的貨品的原料，這樣幾個轉身，數字愈弄愈大，工廠的基礎，愈弄愈危險。同時由於數字的龐大，利潤在表面上非常豐厚，政府的稅收，也就成爲一筆很大的數目。有許多工廠，爲應付稅款起見，甚至向金融界借貸以後去付稅款，也有出賣機器生財，以謀應付的，這種「虛盈實稅」的情况，維持了幾年，　以後方的工業界，在抗戰末期，責在已經非常危險。等到勝利來臨，物價驟跌之後，就弄得不可收拾。一般工廠，求生不得，求死不能，要求生，實在沒有力量，要求死，那末連解散費都無從籌措。這種情形，惟有希望政府能够同情那些工廠，在抗戰期間對政府所作的貢獻，他們移到後方去，實在是想盡一點國民的責任，現在抗戰勝利，但他們的事業，已經到了無法生存的地步，如果政府不加援助的話，那末工業界就要犧牲許多努力份子，而且許多克苦耐勞的專門人才，就要流離失所，所以救濟後方的工業界，對於國家的前途，有很密切的關係。</p>
<p>今後的工業要平均發展</p>
<p>關於今後的工業，那末應該向各地平均分配，集中在一個地方，並不是很好的辦法。上海的工業界，可以把他們的事業，至少支配到長江流域去，這樣就可以使各地的地價，生活標準，逐漸改善，不要因爲一個地方的畸形發展，造成了一地的繁榮。</p>
<p>關於工業的經營上，那末祇要努力做去，埋頭苦幹，前途是有希望的。因為關於資本方面，如果不够，可以吸引市上的游資，祇要工廠辦理着有成效，一般人是願意投資的，關於技術方面，那末不妨採取前進國家的最新方法；可以聘請外籍的技師，和派遣專門人才到國外去從事學習，一批一批地造就人才，那末我們雖則不能和國外工廠競爭，祇少不致於落後到怎樣程度。所以今後的工業界，固然要守着自已的崗位去努力，但這假崗位，應該是一個新式的崗位，要用高瞻遠矚的態度去吸收前進國家的新知識，在國內儘量運用起來，同時還要不斷努力，迎頭趕上。</p>
<p>目前上海的勞資料紛，一日數起，罷工事件，到處皆是，在中國工業方在蘇醒，開始前進的時候，除了其他各方面的問題之外，如果對于勞工問題，不能解決，那末對於工業界的前途，大有影響，勞資雙方，爲了今後的生存起見，要互相諒解，互相協調，資方決不能剝削勞方，勞方也不能要挾資方，雙方應該明白彼此唇齒相關，決不能處於敵對地位。如果沒有背景，不妨平心靜氣的對論，如果有背景的，那末不要受人利用。</p>
<p>生活標準應該配合環境</p>
<p>最後要談到舶來品的問題，這一個問題，的確是目前工業界最嚴重的問題，因爲國外的工廠，設備旣新，人才又多，新發明層出不窮，日新月異，又因爲他們大量生產，成本減低，到中國來傾銷，售價反比國貨爲低。在這種情形之下，中國的工業界即使用盡氣力，也是無法競爭的。這一點，唯有希望社會大衆，要明白自已國家所處的地位，因爲工業界生產的對象，是社會大衆，如果社會大衆摒棄中國工廠的產物，那末中國的工業界，不如整個毀滅，但毀滅以後，還是中國的社會大衆，自食其果。因此社會大衆實在要把目光放遠，在目前這個時候，不能一味求生活上的享受，要處處顧到中國工業界的情形，而儘量扶助中國工業界，採用中國工業界的生產品，那末中國的工業界，可以滋長繁榮，接着民生安定，自然而然可以享受安居樂業的生活，如果一味信仰舶來品，把自己的生活標準提得比美國還高，那末到了相當時候，國家經濟，整個破產，社會大衆，也沒有安定的生活可過了。</p>

It is understood that Mr. Zhou returned to Yan'an to report on the progress of the Consultative Conference, and to seek instructions on the issues of the reorganization of the CCP army and the cessation of military conflict, which were discussed by the Military Affairs Three-Person Group.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] The Government Organization Group and the National Assembly Group of the Political Consultative Conference did not hold meetings today and are scheduled to meet on the afternoon of the 28th to continue consultations.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 27th] Although the representatives of the Democratic League of the Political Consultative Conference temporarily withdrew, it was announced today that an inland cabinet system is currently planned for the government organization case, allowing participation from all parties and factions. With this news, there is renewed hope for a satisfactory conclusion to the conference. It has been decided that the new Chinese constitution will stipulate a two-chamber cabinet system, rather than a presidential system. The Political Consultative Conference has made sufficient progress, leading observers to believe that while a true coalition government will only be established after the National Assembly formulates the constitution and holds general elections, a provisional government will soon be organized with the participation of all parties and factions.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] In our country's War of Resistance against Japan, we relied on the unity of the military and the people and the cooperation of allied nations to achieve today's final victory. In order not to forget the suffering, displacement, and tragic sacrifices of wartime, the Military Affairs Commission and the Executive Yuan have specially stipulated three methods for issuing air raid alarms, and have ordered all provinces and cities across the country to uniformly implement them every Sunday morning at 9:00 AM starting in February of the 35th year of the Republic [1946], so that our military and people may be vigilant and work hard to build the great cause of national reconstruction. The methods for issuing air raid alarms are recorded as follows: (1) Electric and hand-cranked air raid sirens, factory-owned steam whistles, etc., shall sound a long tone for three minutes, and alarms and gongs shall be struck slowly for three minutes.

<h3 id="e7">Police Search Representatives' Residences; Democratic League Withdraws from Conference <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 27th] The subcommittees of the Political Consultative Conference were originally scheduled to meet today to discuss the National Assembly and the reorganization of the government, but were temporarily canceled due to the withdrawal of the Democratic League from the conference. The withdrawal of the Democratic League was a protest against the illegal search of the residences of some members of the party by the police. It also expressed dissatisfaction with the central government's failure to fulfill the four promises announced on the tenth of this month: to guarantee the right to bodily integrity, to grant legal rights to political parties, to support local autonomous governments, and to release purely political prisoners. According to Democratic League spokesman Luo Longji: The party has submitted a written protest to Chairman Chiang last night and is awaiting a reply. If a satisfactory guarantee can be obtained regarding the illegal search of party members' residences by the police, and if Chairman Chiang can determine a date to explain his position on the four promises, then the Democratic League can immediately cease its withdrawal. Government representative Zhang Qun visited the Democratic League headquarters this morning, presumably to prevent its withdrawal, but found no one inside. At the same time, it is generally felt here that if the issue of withdrawal cannot be resolved immediately, the consultative conference, originally scheduled to close on the 29th, may need to extend its session.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 26th] Democratic League representative Luo Longji made explosive remarks at the Political Consultative Conference today. He stated that the residence of Democratic League representative Huang Yanpei was actually searched by the police. If the government fails to provide a satisfactory explanation for this matter, the Democratic League will withdraw from the Political Consultative Conference. According to Luo Longji, CCP representative Zhou Enlai delivered a speech this morning demanding that the government provide full protection to all representatives. The Chongqing CCP office was also visited by the police under the pretext of investigating household registrations. The residences of Shi Liang and Zhang Shenfu were also visited by the police. As for the results of the discussions of the various subcommittees, Luo said that it has been agreed that future orders issued by the President must be approved by the State Council. The President has no veto power over resolutions passed by a three-fifths majority of the State Council. Regarding this, the KMT originally requested a two-thirds majority. The number of State Council members is set at forty, with the KMT occupying half and other parties and factions occupying half. Zhou Enlai has obtained Yan'an's approval for this reorganization plan. How to organize the National Assembly has not yet been resolved.</p>

<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 27th] It is not uncommon for famous foreign figures to arrive quietly in Chongqing to avoid attracting attention, but U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Harriman inadvertently completed this feat today. Harriman arrived at the Chongqing airport on his way back to the United States from Moscow, 24 hours earlier than scheduled, resulting in no one at the airport to greet him. However, this situation was immediately remedied. After Mr. Harriman spoke to Ambassador Marshall's residence, a servant rushed to the airport. At the same time, Chairman Chiang, upon hearing the news, temporarily put aside other matters to receive Mr. Harriman. Marshall's original plans were also changed, and the Chairman sent someone to invite him to dinner and to stay overnight at the Chairman's residence. Marshall drove to the residence to meet with Mr. Harriman. The three spoke together. Mr. Harriman is scheduled to leave Chongqing on the morning of the 29th and will travel to Korea and Japan before returning to the United States.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chongqing, 27th] US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Averell Harriman, returning to the United States from the Soviet Union, flew to Chongqing this afternoon and stayed overnight at Chairman Chiang's summer villa, fifteen miles outside the city.

He repeated his previous remarks in a speech to the Maryland Bar Association tonight, and specifically pointed out that his predecessor as US Ambassador to China, Gauss, had predicted that the National Government led by Chairman Chiang would collapse in 1944, accusing Gauss of being pro-communist and anti-Chiang, and obstructing US foreign policy. Hurley reiterated his resignation statement, saying that all the facts have not yet been made public. Gauss commented in Washington that Hurley's statement was incorrect and that he did not wish to say more at this time.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Army Assault Brigade Performs Parachute Show; Breaking Months of Silence at Kunming Airport <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>[From Our Kunming Correspondent, 26th] Today, the first-ever Chinese paratrooper combat parachute show, a groundbreaking event in the history of China's construction of a new army, was held at Kunming Airport. Although the Kunming citizens are not used to getting up early, by around 9:00 AM, the Wujiaba Airport had more than a thousand spectators. Cars and carriages shuttled back and forth on the sidewalks, enlivening the large airport that had been silent for months. In the specially set up guest seats in the field, the first to arrive was General Chennault, followed by Commander-in-Chief Huo Kuizhang, Principal Mei Yiqi, Commander Yan Yucong, and hundreds of others. Reporters from Kunming newspapers were also invited to sit in. Among the most noteworthy, besides the Kong sisters, were Commander Ma Shigong, who personally served as a greeter, and Deputy Commander Zhang Xuzi, who took the stage to perform, collaborating quite well.</p>
<p>Major Qian Spot Landing</p>
<p>The Assault Brigade performed three subjects today, the first being spot landing. Controlling the parachute in the air at 2,000 feet, trying to make it fall within a fixed point, is not an easy task. The first parachutist at the time was Major Qian Mingnian, a 21-year-old Beiping youth. After graduating from the artillery department of the 17th class of the military academy, he was selected by the Military Training Department to go to the United States, where he entered the Parachute School in Georgia for training. In September of the 33rd year of the Republic [1944], he returned to China after completing his studies and is now the director of the parachute training department of the team. It is said that he was the first person in China to receive parachute training in the United States, and he performed very well at school, so he won praise from the audience in today's performance. After he landed, his 42-year-old mother went to support and embrace him, and kissed his dusty cheeks wildly for half a minute, which amazed the audience. The second parachutist was a general who participated temporarily. He had not sought his wife's consent beforehand. After he landed, she followed the audience and rushed to greet him. Upon closer inspection, it was her husband, former Commander Zhang. Surprised, she replied with comforting smiles. According to Mr. Zhang, this parachute performance was a maiden work. Before leaving the plane, he had hesitated for half a second. When he first opened the parachute, his mind was quite blurred, and it took about a minute to regain consciousness, so he was able to control the speed freely and land within the target circle.</p>
<p>Wonderful Combat Parachute</p>
<p>Following was delayed parachute opening, free-falling from 6,000 feet in the air until the parachute was opened below 1,500 feet. It took about three minutes from leaving the cloud to landing. The performer this time was Captain Zhu Zongquan, a student in the Department of Geology at Southwest Associated University. He initially served as an interpreter for the Assault Brigade, then received parachute training in the brigade, and became an instructor after graduation. After he finished parachuting, the Kong sisters, nieces of a certain important official, expressed their admiration, Principal Mei Yiqi nodded and smiled, and General Chennault shook his hand tightly and praised him endlessly. After this subject was performed, it was the turn of the most exciting paratrooper platoon combat parachute jump. The participants were 24 officers and soldiers of the parachute training department. Personnel and weapons landed at a low altitude of 800 feet. Within fifteen minutes, they assembled into a combat formation and used rocket launchers, flamethrowers, etc. to launch live ammunition attacks on assumed targets. The American soldiers who watched the performance praised and cheered because their marksmanship was good.</p>
<p>General Chennault's Comments</p>
<p>At 11:50 AM, after the performance was over, Commander Ma of the team summoned the officers and soldiers who had returned from the exercise to ask General Chennault for his comments. Chen briefly said: "I was very interested in this visit and exercise. China had a plan to train paratroopers two years ago, but at that time, I felt that various equipment was lacking. Later, thanks to everyone's strong struggle, there are today's results. Today's performance was fast and disciplined, which proves that your usual training is very good. Afterwards, under the command of Commander Ma, we will work hard and move forward, and the future will be boundless." After the comments, Major Qian's mother distributed slices of oranges to comfort the paratroopers, which can be called a small scene of entertainment.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Guilin, 26th] Leng Tikun, the former head of the East Suburb District and commander of the Self-Defense Force in Guilin, abused his authority by committing murder and robbery.

<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 27th] After a temporary halt in the construction of the Pingshan Airfield in Hong Kong, it was found that the work stoppage was merely a break. Construction has recently resumed. On the 21st, foreign engineers burned farmland in the area, and local villagers went to stop them. Due to language barriers, misunderstandings arose, leading to conflict and scuffles. British troops were then dispatched to reinforce the area and set up machine guns in front of the village, creating an extremely tense situation. The situation was eventually mediated by Magistrate Butler, preventing a tragedy. However, the villagers still insist on maintaining the status quo and temporarily halting construction until negotiations between us and the British side yield results.</p>

<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 27th] (1) Chairman Chiang sternly telegraphed all departments, forbidding public servants in recovered areas from engaging in commerce. (2) As the situation in the North remains uncertain, the headquarters of the First, Second, Eleventh, and Twelfth War Zones will not be closed for the time being. The Hebei Provincial Government has decided to move to Baoding for the convenience of work. (3) Sun Lianzhong's trip to Tianjin is to inspect the repatriation of Japanese prisoners and residents. (4) The book censorship in Beiping has been ordered to be canceled. (5) The method of distributing flour by the Hebei-Tianjin branch of the Post-War Relief Administration has received a poor response from the public. People believe that the price of 150 yuan per catty is too high, negating the meaning of relief. The quantity of only 10 catties distributed per household is too small, and the procedure for receiving it is too complicated. Some people have been queuing for two days and still haven't received the 10 catties of flour.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] Gu Zhengzhi, the former Japanese ambassador to the puppet regime in Jiangning, surrendered himself to the Japanese Resident Management Office in this city after being declared a war criminal by the United States. The Management Office then handed him over to the Japanese Resident Self-Government Association for custody. It has been found that Gu Zhengzhi committed numerous evil deeds during his time in China and was listed as one of the main war criminals on our side's blacklist long ago. The Japanese Resident Management Office has received an order from the highest authorities to escort him to the Nanjing Army Headquarters for investigation. Yesterday morning at 8 o'clock, the Management Office dispatched two military police officers to the Japanese Resident Self-Government Association to take Gu into custody. Gu was wearing a leather overcoat and a top hat, and his attitude was arrogant. When a photojournalist took a close-up shot of him, Gu's face showed a hint of embarrassment. The prisoner was escorted to Beijing by personnel from the Management Bureau at 9 o'clock last night and transferred to the Army Headquarters.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Fields Connected, Villages Scattered: A Bird's-Eye View of Chifeng After the Recovery, Our Reporter Flew to Inspect Yesterday <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 27th] Our reporter flew to Chifeng this afternoon on an airplane from the Mediation Department. This place, located far away, had been occupied with the three eastern provinces for thirteen years, and today, not long after its recovery, it has attracted the attention of the entire country due to the handover of defense between the Chinese and Soviet armies and the conflicts between the government and communist forces. After the American plane number 7153 landed at the airport 20 miles outside Chifeng this afternoon, the first report received from nearby farmers was that the Soviet army in Chifeng had indeed retreated by car to the Linxi area on January 23. Order within the city is maintained by the local security team, seemingly under the leadership of the Communist Party, while the security team leader guarding the airport, surnamed Liu, claimed that they were purely a local self-defense organization after the retreat of the Japanese army and were not the Eighth Route Army. There is also the Eighth Route Army not far from Chifeng. The current distance between the Eighth Route Army and the government forces is 20 miles, and there have been no recent conflicts. Today, we only saw the security team, the representative figures there, who walked on foot to the airport from the southeast half an hour after the plane landed, totaling more than 20 people. They were all wearing leather overcoats seized from the Japanese army, and one officer even had the edge star cap badge on his military cap still in place. Their weapons included both the Type 38 and Han Lanchun types. The leader of the team, Captain Liu, was a medium-sized, thin, and modest soldier who claimed to have served in the Northeast Army before the September 18 Incident and then engaged in business in the Rehe area. Another young officer, whose name is unknown, claimed to be from Pingyao, Shanxi, and was forced to work as a coal miner in Rehe after the occupation. He inspected the items carried by the personnel from the Mediation Department but stopped after the reporter explained and dissuaded him. We invited the two to the plane to share the pastries and candies brought by the American army, and they were flattered and embarrassed to the point of being unable to swallow. Today, after the plane arrived at the Chifeng Airport, which is about 900 miles from Beiping, at 11:40 am, a enthusiastic reporter from the Associated Press and two American pilots eagerly wanted to go to Chifeng City to meet with the peace group personnel. Nearby farmers provided three donkeys for them to ride, but they were stopped by a patrolling security team before they had traveled two miles. The telephone between the airport and Chifeng City was damaged, so the security team sent someone on horseback to deliver a letter to the city on our behalf, requesting the peace group to send a car to pick us up as soon as possible. Until 3:30 pm, when the sun was setting in the west, and we were still looking into the distance with binoculars, we did not see any sign of a car. Therefore, amidst the security team officers and soldiers staring blankly and at a loss, we took off and returned to Beiping. However, the people's love for the country there will be forever imprinted in the reporter's mind. Among the farmers who flocked to see the plane and the new visitors, one person, upon learning that we had arrived there from Beiping in just one and a half hours, exclaimed with excitement: "The motherland has been restored, it's really working!" Looking down at Chifeng from the plane, it is a plain surrounded by mountains, with fields connected and villages scattered, not a desolate desert as imagined. A railway running straight through the interior, even with only three or five broken carriages, brings a lot of modernity to this semi-primitive area. There are few trees, and the climate is not much different from Beiping's, with only a thin layer of snow on the mountaintops. The children running to the airport were only wearing cotton-padded jackets and pants, and the farmers in the fields had already started to collect fertilizer in preparation for spring plowing. The main crops in the fields are sorghum, soybeans, and millet, and there was a 50-60% harvest last year. The Japanese did not have time to collect grain before they were defeated, and the villages still have reserves. The security team has now started to borrow grain from households, and the people have been ordered to apportion meat and vegetables to comfort the army as the old year draws to a close. Currently, the puppet Manchurian currency is still in circulation there, as is the Soviet military currency, and the market can hardly use it.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Iranian Representative Submits New Note, Accuses Soviet Union of Violating Agreement, New Iranian Prime Minister Expresses Willingness to Negotiate Directly with Soviet Union, It is Reported that the Security Council Will Announce Suspension of Discussion <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to a London broadcast on the 28th, informed sources claim that the Security Council, scheduled to convene at 3:00 PM tomorrow, will discuss the complaints of Iran and the Soviet Union, which has attracted worldwide attention. However, according to the latest news, in view of Iran's expression of willingness to negotiate directly with the Soviet Union, the Security Council will suspend discussions for the time being and make a decision after considering the results of the negotiations. This matter is expected to be announced at tomorrow's Security Council meeting.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 26th] The Iranian delegation to the United Nations General Assembly today submitted another 2,000-word note to the Security Council, claiming that it could provide sufficient evidence of Soviet interference in Iranian internal affairs. The Security Council is now scheduled to discuss the Iranian issue on Monday. However, because the new Iranian Prime Minister, Sadana, is known to be friendly with the Soviet Union, representatives of various countries to the United Nations General Assembly speculate that Iran may automatically withdraw its complaints against the Soviet Union and engage in direct negotiations. Unexpectedly, the Iranian representative submitted a new note at this time to respond to the Soviet Union's memorandum, which stated that the Soviet Union's position in Iran was legal under the 1921 treaty and that all Iranian accusations were untrue. The Iranian note stated that the Soviet government's refusal to allow Iranian troops to pass through Iranian territory was a clear violation of the 1942 Tripartite Agreement and the Tehran Declaration, which states that all United Nations should respect Iran's territorial integrity, sovereignty, and political independence. Earlier, Iranian Ambassador to the United States, Hassin Ala, stated in Washington that he hoped the new Prime Minister would not give up requesting the Security Council to resolve the Iranian issue, as direct negotiations with the Soviet Union would only waste time and lose the opportunity to appeal to the Security Council.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 27th] Iranian Prime Minister Sandana, in an exclusive interview with a reporter from this agency, stated, "I believe that the complaints submitted to the United Nations by the previous cabinet have already become a *fait accompli*. As the complaint has reached its current stage, I do not intend to withdraw it. However, I will still negotiate directly with the Soviet government, which is not incompatible with the United Nations Charter. I believe that if possible, Iran should negotiate directly with the Soviet Union to avoid increasing the burden on the United Nations."</p>
<h3 id="e23">UN General Assembly Passes Amendment to Election Procedures, Elections Should Have Open Nominations <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 26th Dispatch] After a lengthy three-hour debate, the 18th session of the United Nations General Assembly passed an important amendment to the United Nations General Assembly election procedures by a vote of 25 to 18. According to the United Nations Preparatory Committee's rules on election procedures, elections should be conducted by secret ballot, but there is no provision regarding the nomination of candidates. After the first meeting to elect the President of the General Assembly, the Ukrainian delegation proposed an amendment to the procedures, arguing that all candidates for the General Assembly and various council officers should be nominated publicly, although voting should be done in secret. After important discussions by the Legal Subcommittee last week, Ukraine's proposal was rejected. On the other hand, the Lebanese delegation also proposed another amendment, clearly advocating that there should be no nominations. This proposal was passed by the Legal Subcommittee by only 22 votes to 21, with 8 abstentions. Therefore, when the Legal Subcommittee submitted this proposal to the General Assembly for approval today, it again sparked a heated debate on its merits and demerits. Those who expressed opposition to this amendment included Ukraine, Norway, the United States, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Poland. Those who supported it included the United Kingdom, Lebanon, and Uruguay. Today, in addition to the countries that spoke above, China, France, New Zealand, and India also supported open nominations for elections. Our representative, Gu Weijun, as President of the General Assembly, asked the General Assembly to decide whether the vote on this amendment should be passed by a two-thirds majority or only by a majority. It was unanimously decided that it could be passed by only a majority, and as a result, the amendment was passed by a vote of 25 to 18.</p>

<p>[United Press, London, 26th] Nine US political groups today sent a memorandum to United Nations General Assembly President Spaak, urging the United Nations to grant independence to non-self-governing nations around the world. The memorandum arrived at the General Assembly on the eve of the Security Council's discussion of disputes involving Iran, Indonesia, and Greece, and contained three main points: namely, the independence of mandated territories and colonies, equal economic opportunities for all countries, and balanced immigration for all nationalities. The memorandum specifically mentioned Indonesia, Greece, Palestine, Vietnam, India, Korea, Puerto Rico, and the British West Indies, and advocated for the disarmament of Japanese forces to prevent civil war in China, as well as the severance of diplomatic relations with Franco's Spain.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] According to a London broadcast on the 28th, a surprising demonstration took place here today, with more than 2,000 participants, including British members of parliament, British and Dutch sailors, and American pilots. They passed two resolutions at a mass meeting: (1) Recognizing India's right to independence, allowing India to immediately elect a constituent assembly so that Indians can decide their own fate, opposing the British authorities' imprisonment of Indian patriots and suppression of popular movements. (2) Opposing British interference in Indonesian internal affairs, demanding that British troops immediately cease combat and withdraw from Indonesia.</p>

<h3 id="e26">United Nations Headquarters May be Temporarily Located in New York <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 27th] New York may become the temporary location of the United Nations, as the design of necessary buildings will take several years after the selection of a permanent headquarters. The chairman of the group surveying possible locations for a permanent headquarters in the United States, Yugoslav representative Gavrilovic, has already been informed by New York Mayor O'Dwyer of the necessary facilities, including a land area of 135,000 square feet for the construction of the Secretariat building. This year, the Secretariat will have 1,356 personnel, and by 1949, that number will increase to 2,210, requiring 221,000 square feet of space. For the facilities where the various councils and special committees hold meetings from time to time, including two conference rooms accommodating 600 people each, three conference rooms accommodating 300 people each, and twelve small committee rooms of about 1,500 square feet each, there is also a need for a library with 400,000 volumes, a press room, a document storage room, a cafe, a bar, and a recreation room. The General Assembly, which meets once a year from the beginning of September to October, needs an assembly hall accommodating 3,000 people, committee rooms, a press room accommodating 1,500 journalists, a document room attached to the assembly hall, and at least sufficient living space for 3,000 representatives, advisors, and staff. The required hotel accommodations include 150 suites, 1,000 first-class rooms, and 1,350 second-class rooms. Given the current situation in New York, this is a difficult problem, as reservations for hotel rooms in New York must be made several weeks in advance.</p>
<h3 id="e27">US Asks Britain for Cooperation to Ban Opium, Taking Action at the Source is the Best Solution, Britain Has Proposed a Counterproposal <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 26th] According to authoritative sources, the United States has asked Britain to ban the production and consumption of opium in India and Burma (excluding legitimate medicinal uses). Britain has proposed a counterproposal, advocating that the United Nations handle the entire issue of opium production and private sales. Britain proposed that the United Nations Economic and Social Council establish a committee to be responsible for handling this issue. Britain apparently wants to create an organization similar to the League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee to handle all issues related to opium. US officials will certainly agree with Britain's proposal, but still believe that taking action at the source is the best solution. The US estimates that India produces 500 tons of opium per year and says that India only needs 100 tons of opium for medical use, with the rest being smuggled for export. According to informed sources, the opium problem in Burma is also very thorny. The British pointed out that the residents of northern Burma are heavily addicted to opium and often use it in religious ceremonies, so the British are unwilling to interfere. Iran and India are the two major opium-producing areas. In 1934, the British allowed the abolition of the opium state monopoly and the banning of opium consumption in the areas recaptured from Japanese occupation. For the British, this matter has the greatest impact on Hong Kong and Malaya, and it is expected that the British will implement their promise there. The situation in the Dutch East Indies before the war was not serious, as it did not produce opium, and there were less than 40,000 indigenous opium users and about 40,000 overseas Chinese. India has not been occupied by the Japanese army, and the promises made by Britain do not seem to apply, so the British have not made a clear statement on the Indian opium problem.</p>

<p>[United Press, London, 26th] Eleanor Roosevelt stated in a speech to 400 US troops at a theater in London today that she intends to propose within the United Nations that schools around the world should be forced to teach a common international language. Language barriers are most likely to hinder world peace, so she hopes that the United Nations can stipulate that children around the world, in addition to their native language, must also learn a world language. The United States is economically and politically inseparable from other countries, and we should understand the needs of the people of all countries and think about them. Americans have embraced isolationism, but they do not know that if we cannot understand the rest of the world, a third sacrifice may be unavoidable.</p>

<p>[French News Agency, Ankara, 26th] Political observers here believe that if there are changes within the Turkish government, the Soviet Union's attitude towards Turkey may change. If the Turkish cabinet can express greater understanding of the Kars and Ardahan regions, it is believed that the Soviet Union's trust in Turkey will also increase. The Turkish government does not seem to intend to change the current government, believing that in fact, President İsmet and Prime Minister Saraçoğlu have consistent support. Observers believe that Soviet-Turkish relations are unlikely to change before the close of the United Nations General Assembly's current session and the resolution of the Iranian-Soviet issue.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Mysterious Figure on the Korean Political Stage, Kim Il-sung Led Guerrilla Warfare Against Japan for Fifteen Years <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 26th] Another mysterious figure has appeared on the Korean political stage, whose life and experiences are full of legends, just as described in legends. This is General Kim Il-sung, a hero of the Korean Communist Party, whose name is known to thousands of Koreans. It is said that this person led guerrilla warfare in northeastern China against the Japanese army for fifteen years. Although most of the reports about this person are close to mythology and are difficult to verify, there is no doubt that his name has been deeply imprinted in the minds of countless Koreans. Korean children play soldiers, competing to dress up as Kim Il-sung's army as an honor. The Japanese wanted to arrest him, spending nearly one million yuan. This person has received the Soviet Order of Military Merit twice since 1931. According to recent unconfirmed reports, he has arrived in Seoul, North Korea, under Soviet occupation, from Yan'an, accompanied by thousands of guerrillas. Locals have heard that he will come to Seoul and have organized welcoming groups, but the right wing has publicly ridiculed his return. A spokesperson for the Kim Gu Provisional Government claimed that this person has long been dead and that the hero who came to Korea is an imposter. It is said that the Kim Il-sung in Seoul is still young, about 33 to 37 years old. Skeptics say that Kim's age is so young that it proves that the claim that he led guerrilla warfare in 1931 is untrue. A Korean leftist journalist claimed today that he had met with Kim four times in Seoul and said that Kim is now the secretary of the Korean Communist Party in North Korea, planning to engage in political activities. Kim has an extraordinary appearance and is tall, which is rare among ordinary 35-year-old Koreans. When Kim's guerrilla team arrived in Korea, they were disarmed by the Soviet army, but they were allowed to recruit an army of 200,000 people. It is now certain that the leftist elements in North Korea unanimously support Kim. Whether he is real or fake, a soldier or a politician, he will eventually become a powerful figure in Korea.</p>

In De Gaulle's cabinet last November, he served as Minister of State. Guy Mollet is 60 years old, the founder of "Le Robert" newspaper, which ceased publication after the establishment of the Vichy regime.

<p>Emergency Repairs to Dangerous Dikes Along Hangzhou-Haiyan Sections: The Qiantang River coastal project has not been repaired for eight years due to the war. Currently, the stone dikes along the Haiyan, Yanping, and Shaoxiao sections have many collapses and breaches, especially in the Haining Eight Fort area, which is particularly dangerous. The Emergency Repair Association of the Seawall has decided to first repair the dikes with the characters Du, Hao, Zhong, and Dai in Haining and the dikes near Tengyabridge in Haiyan. Tenders will be invited immediately to purchase engineering materials such as wooden piles and accelerate the work. The Zhejiang-Fujian branch of the Good Rescue General Office has allocated 2,000 tons of flour to replace work with relief. The Hangzhou office of the United Relief Administration plans to allocate 500 barrels of cement to meet the needs of the repair work. The provincial government has approved an allocation of 6 million yuan to start the Haiyan project on the south bank of the Wenjia Dike.

<p>Suspicious Acting Clergyman Detained: The police chief of the East District Police Station yesterday found a suspicious traveler named Zhang Jinjing, 44 years old, from Yancheng, on a Liyang steamer. He was a Jesus follower planning to preach in various places. A travel permit from the bandit-occupied area was found on Zhang. According to his statement, he came from Su to Wuxi and then to Liyang to preach. He claimed that Yancheng was divided into Jianyang, Yanbu, and Yandong counties by the bandit army after it was occupied. The travel permit was issued by the Xinyang Town Government of the Sixth District of Jianyang County. According to the police station, Zhang held a road pass from the bandit area and came from the bandit area. Although he claimed to be a missionary, there was no evidence. Moreover, Zhang had considerable knowledge of social and political affairs, which raised suspicions. A special document was prepared and submitted to the General Bureau for interrogation and verification.</p>
<p>Xiyi Highway Resumes Traffic: The Xiyi Highway is an important road in Jiangnan. During the war, the road surface and bridges were destroyed by the enemy and puppets, and traffic was blocked, so only waterways were available between Wuxi and Yixing. After the victory, the Provincial Construction Department and the Third Front Army made every effort to repair it, and two-thirds of it has been repaired, and it will soon be completed. Local people in this county have organized the Xiyi Long-Distance Bus Company to purchase a large number of vehicles to facilitate commercial travel between Xiyi. The vehicles have been shipped from Shanghai to Wuxi. Before the road surface and bridges are completely repaired, interval buses will be operated first, from Wuxi to Xueyan Bridge, with four round trips daily, starting from the 28th of this month.</p>

<p>— Our Newspaper Nanjing, 21st Dispatch, Zhou Feng</p>
<p>When Nanjing is mentioned, it's as if people can't forget Fuzimiao, especially Fuzimiao after the Japanese burnt it, which has aroused the concern of many outsiders. In fact, Fuzimiao is indeed memorable, with its colorful and chaotic patterns dividing the day into several segments: In the morning, most Nanjing people go to teahouses to drink tea, order a bowl of soy milk, a few duck oil pastries, or a cup of sweet fermented rice balls with two eggs, sitting there for two or three hours. Business negotiations, casual chats with friends, as long as it's morning, one can't forget the teahouses of Fuzimiao.</p>
<p>Good Business for Restaurants</p>
<p>Besides teahouses, there are even more large restaurants and small eateries. At noon, especially in the evening, they are filled with diners, as if they don't have to pay. Fortunately, Nanjing is a political center, with many adults and gentlemen. Today you invite guests, tomorrow I'll return the favor, which indeed brings good business to the restaurants. Cars lined up imposingly in front of the restaurants, with passes from certain agencies displayed in the windows, as if asking in the cold wind: "Visiting here often, is it for office work? It's such a dark day!" Restoration, restoration, the achievements in Fuzimiao after the calamity are remarkable and impressive!</p>

<p>In front of Fuzimiao is the Qinhuai River, which holds countless stories of intimacy and romance. Now, only the section from Wende Bridge to Huaiqing Bridge can be used for boating. The river water is still murky, and the dilapidated houses on both sides further accentuate the aging of the Qinhuai River. Those charming painted boats, badly damaged and covered with a layer of dust, are forlornly moored on the riverbank, hibernating for the winter in the cold weather. The river surface is quiet, and occasionally in the morning sunlight, there are a few wisps of mist-like water vapor, which ultimately cannot conceal the cold desolation. Compared to the light smiles and soft songs of summer nights, it is bound to evoke many sighs.</p>
<p>Elegant Descendants Still Exist Today</p>
<p>"When will the spring flowers and autumn moon end?" It can't sing the sad songs of the world. Generation after generation, there will always be days when people have clothes but can't keep warm, and food but can't eat their fill. The songs by the Qinhuai River are always so melancholic. The youth of young girls is constantly consumed here, watching the falling flowers and flowing water, without thinking about their own heaven and earth? The courting of elegant descendants requires them to exhaust their smiles. How much of life is there? Is it just consumed by beauties and money?</p>
<p>Why Must There Be Strife?</p>
<p>Fuzimiao after the calamity quickly restored its original chaotic state. There are singing venues, teahouses, restaurants, and all kinds of shops. After the victory, many dance halls were added. The long-absent neon lights flashed dazzlingly, and the soul-stirring jazz music deliberately夺走了 the old琴声 of "依依拉拉". We are all fellow sufferers in this world, why must there be strife?</p>
<p>Kuiguang Pavilion's Precious Pearl Robbed</p>
<p>Previously, there was a teahouse in the Qinhuai River called Kuiguang Pavilion. It is said that there was a crystal clear pearl on the top of the pavilion, shining like a star. When the Japanese soldiers burned Fuzimiao, they plundered this pearl. When Nanjing people mention Kuiguang Pavilion, they feel sorry for that pearl. It is said that it was bestowed by an emperor from an unknown dynasty. In short, the pavilion in the river where Kuiguang Pavilion was located was destroyed, which is an ironclad fact!</p>
<p>Overview of the Four Major Shopping Malls</p>
<p>There is a Yong'an Shopping Mall in Fuzimiao, which was newly built after being destroyed in the calamity. Its appearance resembles a large company. Tall buildings, crystal clear display windows, bring together all kinds of shops, as if everyone is joining hands, each managing their own business. (Like Shanghai's "Jing'an Shopping Mall" and "Xinshi Market," etc.) However, it is built more exquisitely than those in Shanghai, and even the corridors are covered with entire pieces of glass windows. Nanjing now has four major shopping malls (Central Market, Fuxing Shopping Mall, Jiankang Shopping Mall, Yong'an Shopping Mall), with relatively good architectural facilities and quite magnificent appearances. Its scope and appearance are comparable to Shanghai's four major companies.</p>
<p>The Necessities of the Nine Streams and Three Religions</p>
<p>One corner of Fuzimiao is extravagant and seductive, tinged with too much licentiousness, and is a playground for the wealthy. However, who would have thought that the situation in the other corner is the opposite? The former Confucius Temple was destroyed in this fire, with broken walls and tiles, and the surrounding low bungalows cannot be restored. This Confucius Temple, with only a circle of walls, has become the arena for the "heroes" of the nine streams and three religions. During the day, there are various杂要of the square, erecting flagpoles, storytellers, ballad singers, crosstalk performers, peep shows, ointment sellers, and wanting knives and guns... Those people have crude smiles on their faces, and as long as you offend them a little, they are guaranteed to burst into abuse.</p>
<p>What Does the Jianghu Taste Know?</p>
<p>At night, the "heroes" of the daytime watch the others enjoy themselves. In the dark, there is a dim oil lamp. A fortune teller holds the hand of a tourist, looking at the light, looking at his face, looking at his clothes, looking at... Then he calls him "brother," and then talks incessantly about the past and the future, coaxing everyone to laugh. Some leave with their legs dragging, muttering in their mouths, "Jianghu taste, what does it know?" However, only with everything Jianghu, is everyone willing to surround these stalls every day, laughing.</p>
<p>Girls Shuttle Back and Forth</p>
<p>In front of the square of the former Martial Temple, it is the playground for ordinary "disgraced heroes." They tease the young girls when they see them walking back and forth in this area, coarsely and loudly, and sometimes even put their arms around their shoulders.</p>
<p>In front of Pan Palace, in the square, there used to be the lowest-grade prostitutes soliciting customers. As long as you are willing to "take the risk," alas, it is pitiful to say, how many coolies find comfort here. Although it is now prohibited by the police, occasionally there are still two or three looking for their "pleasure," muttering: "Let's go play at my house..." In this corner, alas, life is wasted!</p>
<p>Nanjing, Nanjing is a magnificent capital, but Fuzimiao, Fuzimiao is the most bustling district in Nanjing. Calamity, calamity cannot destroy Nanjing, cannot destroy this pitiful and lovely Fuzimiao!</p>

<p>Three Representatives in Beiping (Photo) Taking off the Plane Together (From right to left)</p>
<p>Government Representative: Shen Yi and Amiable General Zheng Jiemin</p>
<p>US Representative: Chargé d'Affaires of the Embassy General Robertson</p>
<p>Communist Representative: Unruly and Unrestrained General Ye Jianying</p>
<h3 id="e41">Mediation Department Launches Work, Three Representatives in Beiping, Our Newspaper 18th Dispatch, Wen Yong from the Old Capital <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The three representatives who were sent to Beiping to implement the ceasefire order jointly decided and promulgated by the National Government and the Communist Party arrived here by plane on the 14th. At present, the Ceasefire Committee has officially established an executive department, and a large rectangular plaque with white characters on a black background is hung at the entrance of the Xiehe Hospital, which is enough to attract the attention of the people of the old capital.</p>
<p>These three representatives can be said to be the VIPs in the Beijing Hotel at present, and everyone places unlimited hope on them. The Communist representative lives on the first floor, the government representative lives on the second floor, and the US representative lives on the third floor. The lights are on all night, which shows the intensity of their work.</p>
<p>At the joint reception of reporters in Ping City by the three representatives, US Representative General Robertson said from the position of "a friendly and neutral 家家" (that's what Robertson said): "What I want to work hard for is to implement the agreement that has already been reached between the National Government and the Communist Party." This is similar to General Li Zongren's tone, who said: Our internal strife is like two brothers in a family who have lost their harmony. There is no need for neighbors to persuade them from the side. After a long time, they will naturally return to good terms. However, after the persuasion of neighbors, it is much easier to get better. General Ye Jianying expressed gratitude and shame for this, because the United States has given us too much help in the persuasion aspect.</p>
<p>Government Representative General Zheng Jiemin, after reviewing the written questions raised by the reporters, gave us a very satisfactory answer in a continuous stream. At a glance, you can tell that he is a calm, dignified, amiable, and approachable general, with a well-thought-out plan, skilled and lively. General Zheng has a round face and is full of energy. His body is also very strong. He succeeded Yang Xuancheng as the Director of the Second Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs, specializing in military propaganda work, and is a talent admired by all parties. He and General Ye Jianying are fellow villagers in Guangdong. The only difference is that General Ye has a black beard and is a Russian returnee. When he was talking to reporters, Chief of Staff Cai Wenzhi was sitting beside him, silent and smiling. In addition, those who came to Ping with him included personnel dispatched from the Second Department, the Foreign Affairs Bureau, the Military Statistics Bureau, and the Military Police Headquarters. Among them, the one who impressed the reporters the most was General Ji Zejin, who was responsible for publicity. He represents the government's views on news propaganda, and his position is equivalent to that of Ms. Gong Peng, who represents the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Now we want to talk about Communist Representative General Ye Jianying. As soon as he arrived in Beijing, he stayed at the Beijing Hotel and immediately met with reporters in Ping City. He told reporters that as a Communist representative, I flew here from Chongqing, just like we were sent to Chongqing from Yan'an, in order to "stop fighting," in order to realize peaceful reunification, in order to stop the civil war. Everyone should take the wind in our sails at this time, and take the wind in our sails together with foreigners. When answering reporters' questions, Ms. Gong Peng was always by his side. She is the wife of the famous Communist political commentator Qiao Mu. Her English proficiency is said to be quite high. She was very active in Chongqing, serving as a reporter for Xinhua Daily and engaging in Communist international propaganda work, and was once famous. Now her job is one of the Communist representatives of the News Group of the Mediation Department. Attached is a brief biography of General Ye:</p>
<p>General Ye Jianying, styled Yiwei, was born in 1903 in a merchant family in Meixian, Guangdong. He graduated from the second term of the Yunnan Military Academy. He once served in Chen Jiongming's troops in Fujian. Later, he was transferred to Guangzhou, joined the Communist Party, and served as an instructor at the Whampoa Military Academy. During the Northern Expedition, he served as the commander of the 21st Division. In 1929, he went to Russia. He is fluent in Russian and German. After returning to China, he served as the Chief of Staff of the Communist Army, a member of the Communist Party's Political Bureau. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he served as the Chief of Staff of the Eighth Route Army until now. General Ye has always had an unruly style.</p>
<p>The executive groups have already gone to various places to actively launch their work.</p>

<h3 id="e43">A Cry from the People of Northern Jiangsu <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Editor,</p>
<p>Enclosed please find a manuscript. I wrote this piece out of righteous indignation. Please publish it in your newspaper, and I will take full responsibility for its content. Even if the "New Fourth Army" marches into Yangzhou tomorrow, I will still stand by these words! Respectfully, Wang Han, Yangzhou, late on January 23rd.</p>
<p>After liberation, the people of Northern Jiangsu never imagined that cities such as Qingjiang, Huai'an, Baoying, Xinghua, Gaoyou, Yancheng, Rugao, and Dongtai would once again suffer the ravages of artillery fire and the calamities of war. Yangzhou, which was fortunate enough not to be captured by the "New Fourth Army," and places like Zhenjiang, are filled with refugees wandering the streets, as in a famine year. Even more unexpectedly, during the glorious war of resistance against Japan, people never knew that the "New Fourth Army" had attacked Gaoyou, Xinghua, Dongtai... Now that the war of resistance is over, the "New Fourth Army" has come to attack these cities, displaying their most valiant combat behaviors! The "warriors" are said to have sacrificed themselves heroically, with casualties often numbering in the thousands. And each time, ships loaded with "stacked salted fish" (dead bodies packed haphazardly) are prepared in advance. It is difficult to find similar records of such grand scenes in the history of the resistance against Japan in Northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>"Often numbering in the thousands"? How many people does the "New Fourth Army" in Northern Jiangsu actually have?</p>
<p>Yes, this is something that needs to be seriously clarified.</p>
<p>The "warriors" who sacrifice themselves in each city assault are not the regular troops of the "New Fourth Army," but rather strong young men and ordinary people forcibly conscripted from the countryside, including merchants and peddlers. Whoever gets caught is destined to die, and they must be reliable in dying. Driven to the front lines, they face machine guns spewing fire, and behind them are more machine guns waiting, used by the "New Fourth Army" to deal with those who "unheroically" retreat.</p>
<p>These people, because they are completely untrained, don't even have a rifle. But their assigned task is to be the vanguard—charging and scaling the city walls! Each person has two hand grenades. To say that this is the "New Fourth Army's" weapon for those scaling the walls is not as accurate as saying it's something to give them courage to hold in their hands. This is similar to another tactic: using several cotton quilts, soaking them in water, covering a square table with them, and covering the surroundings. They then force several people to push it forward, telling them it's a "tank" that can deflect bullets. When batches of them are sacrificed, they no longer care whether they live or die. And each time they fight, they sacrifice batches of innocent people to intimidate the enemy, reduce their morale, and make the enemy soldiers unwilling to shoot at these innocent people. This is precisely a tactic that the "New Fourth Army" has been using since liberation.</p>
<p>Although the commanders of the "New Fourth Army" boast: "One burst from a machine gun is fifty bullets. We'll use fifty-one human bombs to fight you. After fifty human bombs are sacrificed and your burst of bullets is finished, our fifty-first human bomb will seize your machine gun!"</p>
<p>Such boasting is probably more magnificent than the boasting of any military strategist in the world!</p>
<p>But let us consider: What about those innocent people who are sacrificed in batches? I think that anyone who understands this situation will be at a loss for words for a moment, but their hearts will be filled with infinite sorrow and indignation! And opposing the civil war, opposing the "New Fourth Army," is the loudest cry from the bottom of their hearts.</p>
<p>Therefore, people often hate the "New Fourth Army's" "disruptive" behavior so much that they even hate the National Army for not being able to resolutely use force to eliminate the "New Fourth Army." People know that the National Army in Northern Jiangsu now has enough forces to annihilate the "New Fourth Army." At the very least, capturing the several neighboring counties of Jiangdu is not a problem.</p>
<p>The Political Consultative Conference's most precious product! The "Ceasefire Order" clearly states that "at 1:00 AM on the 13th" (?), all conflicts nationwide should cease. Yet on the evening of the 14th, there was a small, amusing incident on the front lines of Shaobo (I must admit that I am suffering from hysteria when I use the word "amusing" here!). That morning, the "New Fourth Army" erected a sign with the words "Ceasefire Ordered" on a tall tree, and the National Army, seeing this, was left in peace. However, that evening, without warning, the "New Fourth Army" launched a surprise attack. The result: over a hundred National Army soldiers were killed or wounded. In the past few days, the "New Fourth Army" has been besieging Luhe County on a large scale. Today (please note: today is exactly ten days after the "Ceasefire Order" took effect), the news is that the "New Fourth Army" is attacking the neighboring county of Taizhou (i.e., Taixian). Because the "New Fourth Army" does not abide by the law, to prevent them from sending plainclothes soldiers to engage in "city infiltration" again (as happened before), Yangzhou is busy organizing the baojia system and strictly checking household registrations. The "residence permit" will once again be the passport that people must carry when traveling. The new name is "resident certificate," which of course must be re-applied for at the police station. The cost of the photograph, around 300 yuan, and the 25 yuan fee for buying the "application form" is of course not a problem for the wealthy, but for ordinary families with six members, an unexpected expense of over 2,000 yuan, at a time when the end of the lunar year is approaching and expenses are numerous, makes people resentful! The phrase "the New Fourth Army is really killing people" is on everyone's lips!</p>
<p>Every night, there is a street curfew at 10 PM. Military and government personnel are not allowed to pass through unless on official business. Furthermore, military and government agencies and any residents are not allowed to let outsiders stay overnight, except for those reporting to the household registration. These are the latest measures taken by the authorities to prevent the "New Fourth Army" from infiltrating the city.</p>
<p>In the homes of relatives and friends, you can often meet refugees from Xinghua, Gaoyou, Yancheng, Qingjiang, and other places. Naturally, this is also true of hotels. There is also a "Refugee Youth Reception Center of [X] County," which is full of young people who fled to Yangzhou because the New Fourth Army captured their hometowns and because they have difficulty living. When you chat with them, you have no choice but to believe that the "New Fourth Army's" disruptive and sinful acts are all true. Most obviously, you will immediately feel that their indignation towards the "New Fourth Army" is greater and more profound than anything else. For example, they believe that since the "New Fourth Army" is still attacking the National Army after the "Ceasefire Order" was issued, the Nationalist government could very well refuse to recognize the credentials of the Communist Party representatives, such as Zhou Enlai, who participated in the Political Consultative Conference, and that at the very least, Mr. Mao Zedong should be held responsible! They have this understanding: many of the members of the "New Fourth Army" in Northern Jiangsu were originally local bullies and ruffians, and even former puppet troops reorganized. The orders of the "Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party" cannot be universally disseminated. And these elements often "elope" with a gang after capturing a town. The "New Fourth Army" then has no choice but to supplement its numbers by adding some undesirable elements, so the common people are in terrible trouble! The most fiery indignation can be summed up as: "Let us use the 'Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors' to accuse them. Is there any reason to defend the New Fourth Army's actions as anything other than traitorous behavior? Resisting the government, expanding the army without authorization, engaging in militarism, colluding with the enemy, incorporating puppet troops, forcibly conscripting young men, issuing 'resistance currency,' establishing governments without authorization, and harming the people..." This stands in stark contrast to yesterday's (22nd) report: the Shanghai journalists' inspection team sent a telegram to the government representatives and Communist Party representatives at the Political Consultative Conference, stating, "...Peace has been achieved, unity has been successful, and the people of the whole country are overjoyed..."</p>
<p>People are wondering why some newspapers in Shanghai are still helping the Communist Party make many sophistical arguments, while the commentaries in many newspapers rarely thoroughly criticize the facts of the Communist Party's extremely wicked behavior, and there are very few fair and factual reports. Furthermore, you can't see any articles in many supplements that reflect or comment on the Communist Party's behavior. I must say that this dissatisfaction of theirs is somewhat narrow-minded, only thinking of their own side. As Dale Carnegie said, "A sore on one's own neck is more concerning than an earthquake in Africa." They haven't considered that: first, Shanghai and Northern Jiangsu are two worlds, like comparing a 14-story building to a thatched hut; second, Shanghai is an international city, and the problems that people pay attention to are broad, progressive, and international, because people's vision is broad, progressive, and international!</p>
<p>However, when they see the news that a Shanghai journalists' inspection team is coming to inspect Northern Jiangsu, they are overjoyed! They are eagerly anticipating the early arrival of the inspection team and are holding attitudes of great welcome and boundless gratitude!</p>

<h3 id="e44">Understanding the Current Political Situation <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Youjiong</p>
<p>The implementation of democratic politics has become the shared goal of our entire nation. However, we know that democratic politics should be based on reason. Only when the government and the people are based on reason can constitutional democracy proceed along a fixed track, and can normal and appropriate relations develop within domestic politics. Given this premise, I hope that the people of our country will use reason to correctly understand the truth of future domestic political changes.</p>
<p>The multi-party political system is about to begin again in China. Multi-party politics is not something new in the eyes of the Chinese people; from the first year of the Republic of China to the tenth year, China also implemented a multi-party political system similar to that of Europe and the United States. In the declaration issued in Beijing in the first year of the Republic of China, the Kuomintang stated: "The rise of political parties in a country should be characterized by the confrontation of two major parties, not the separation of small factions." The Kuomintang has never failed to advocate for party politics, but because there were no fewer than dozens of large and small political groups in the ten years after the founding of the Republic of China, the result was detrimental to national politics, and they eventually disappeared invisibly. We trace the cause to the fact that the various political groups were only vying for immediate power, without permanent political programs, and failed to gain the support of the broad masses of the people. The political parties of Britain and the United States follow a set constitutional path, sharing the same principle—liberalism—and only engage in intellectual competition on policies to seek the support of the people and gain power. Since the establishment of the legal path of alternating governance between the two parties, the situation of using force to seize power has been permanently eliminated. Based on this, we express our infinite hope that future party politics can work towards the promotion of democratic politics under the guidance of the nation's founding father's established nation-building program and the supreme nation-building principle unanimously supported by the entire nation—the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>However, when we look back at the history of party struggles twenty years ago, we cannot but awaken the people, raise vigilance, and pay close attention to future party politics. The existence of political parties must be based on the combination of political views, not on the combination of personal issues. The history of the corruption of political parties twenty years ago should not be forgotten by the people of our country. Forming parties based on personal connections is not the proper path for political parties; and those who form a party today and establish a society tomorrow, only for the sake of seizing power, will also not be tolerated by the people of our country. What we hope for from future political parties is that they must have clear positions, genuine sincerity in building the nation, and indeed a large number of party members. Only in this way can they promote democracy. The debate over one-party versus multi-party rule has also occurred many times on the Chinese political stage, but the nation-building tradition, the spirit of the times, and the tendency of the people cannot be ignored. Today, those who discuss politics often criticize the Kuomintang's one-party rule, and even foreigners who scratch an itch from afar often do not understand. We are willing to briefly narrate the nation-building tradition of the Republic of China from the objective standpoint of the people, and we hope that those who discuss politics at home and abroad will not ignore the history of the founding of the Republic of China, which was exchanged for the blood of our revolutionary predecessors. The Kuomintang of China is the revolutionary party that built the Republic of China. The Republic of China over the past fifty years, directly and indirectly, has been nurtured and created under the Three Principles of the People of the Kuomintang, just as the Soviet Union was created and governed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Since we agree that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has long implemented its one-party dictatorship due to the needs of the revolutionary environment, we have no reason to criticize the Kuomintang of China for gradually realizing its grand vision of returning power to the people based on the nation-building program. As for the "tutelage by the party" level, it is only a transitional period in the nation-building path. If we examine in detail the teachings of Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Republic of China, and the documents of the Kuomintang of China over the past fifty years, none of them contain the claim of permanently holding power without implementing the return of power to the people. Therefore, those who discuss one-party dictatorship today should have some understanding of this point. Even in terms of "tutelage," the Kuomintang's "tutelage" is different from the Soviet Communist Party's "dictatorship." The spirit and purpose of the so-called "class dictatorship" and "one-party dictatorship" is to ultimately concentrate political power in one class or one party; while the spirit and purpose of the Kuomintang's tutelage is to ultimately transfer political power to the people, its purpose and destination are exactly the opposite of dictatorship. In 1935, Professor Holcombe of Harvard University in the United States came to China to lecture and gave an accurate explanation of the Kuomintang's tutelage. He believed that "after the military administration period and before the constitutional administration period, there is a tutelage period, which is very suitable for China's needs. During this period, many political habits can be developed, and many precedents regarding the basic national system can be accumulated, becoming the constitution of the new China, and the result is workable and suitable for national conditions." Mr. Holcombe's words best represent the objective views of Western political scholars. We hope that people at home and abroad will no longer use this as an excuse to attack the Kuomintang. For fifteen years, the National Government has solemnly declared that it will eventually return power to the people, only the long-term invasion of the Japanese pirates and domestic unrest have prolonged the deadline. The convening of the National Assembly on May 5th of this year will fulfill the Kuomintang's grand vision of returning power to the people, and the original intention of building the nation can be announced to China and the world. I hope that the people of the country have a correct understanding of this nation-building argument, and that the Kuomintang members should adhere to the consistent nation-building vows of their party and not abandon what they believe in. This is the first.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Three Principles of the People are not the principles of the Kuomintang alone, but the highest principles of nation-building in the Republic of China. The "Program for Political Tutelage" and the "Organization Law of the National Government" promulgated in 1928 officially announced the beginning of "building the Republic of China with the Three Principles of the People of this revolution and the Five-Power Constitution" in documents. Since then, the "Laws of the Tutelage Period," the "Outline for Resistance War and Nation Building," and the "Draft Constitution of the Republic of China" that are yet to be implemented all stipulate that the Three Principles of the People are the highest standards for nation building. Since then, the Three Principles of the People have legally constituted the principles of nation building and are the original driving force behind the political power of the Republic of China. The people of the country have already formed a relationship of obedience to the aforementioned basic laws that have been promulgated, and they have a legal obligation to believe in and obey the Three Principles of the People. In terms of the various parties, they have all clearly stated in the past and present that they follow the Three Principles of the People as the principles of nation building. Therefore, the various parties should engage in activities under the highest principles of nation building of the Three Principles of the People, just as the political parties of Britain and the United States engage in activities under the great principle of democracy. In other words, the activities of the various parties must not violate the Three Principles of the People or attempt to overthrow the Three Principles of the People, just as the main political parties in Britain and the United States must not oppose liberalism, which is the founding principle of Britain and the United States. Therefore, whether in Britain, the United States, or in our country, there is only one founding principle, and no country has two parallel founding principles. This is a characteristic shared by modern countries. In the past, most of China's political parties did not recognize this basic principle, so various ideologies flocked to China, leading to long-term chaos in Chinese politics. Today, the various parties have expressed their adherence to the Three Principles of the People as a common principle, which is a major step forward. I hope that the people of our country will use this as a touchstone to judge the right and wrong of the activities of the various parties. Only under the nation-building principle of the Three Principles of the People can the various parties have a legitimate status. This is the second.</p>
<p>As for the future of China, regardless of whether it implements a one-party system or a multi-party system, after the implementation of the constitution, the Kuomintang will return power to the people. Although it will be an ordinary political party, it will still not lose its primary position in leading the nation. Because the various parties all follow the Three Principles of the People, the Kuomintang, which created the Republic of China, should still lead the people and urge the realization of the Three Principles of the People, whether in power or in opposition, based on its consistent nation-building aspirations. What should be discussed is whether China should adopt a two-party confrontation or a multi-party coalition in the future. This is an issue that should be valued by the people. The system of the Five-Power Constitution is very different from the British and American systems. It is neither a responsible cabinet system nor a presidential system, but a system of popularly elected government with the National Assembly as its center and the separation of political and governing powers. Although the various parties are very active in the National Assembly, it seems unlikely that one party can monopolize power. The author believes that after the situation of separate parties is created in the future, there will be only two trends: one is that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will be at the center, and each will absorb other parties to form two major opposing parties; the other is that various parties will be separated, and there will be calls for unity today and breakups tomorrow. The development of all these trends depends on the evolution of the situation in the future, but in any case, the entire nation must be the decision-maker of future political trends. I hope that the people will first recognize the truth of the political situation, and then exert the power of the people to urge the various parties to adhere to the normal path of the constitution and not engage in any acts of destroying the law or disrupting discipline. Only in this way can the foundation of a century of constitutionalism be laid on the shoulders of the people of the country.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Minister Chen Cheng and General Xue Yue Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday on the Yong Sui Warship: Chen Will Seek Treatment for Duodenal Disease <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Minister of Military Affairs and concurrently Chief of Naval Affairs Chen Cheng arrived in Shanghai on the Yong Sui warship after departing from Nanjing at 8 AM yesterday morning. This reporter went to the Naval Affairs Office pier on Huangpu Road in the city at approximately 3 PM yesterday afternoon to await their arrival. At nearly 4 PM, the Yong Sui warship was faintly visible in the distance. At 4:05 PM, it docked at the pier. This reporter, along with those welcoming them, boarded the ship successively. General Chen, wearing a light-colored cape, with slightly graying temples but in high spirits and with a welcoming smile, shook hands and exchanged pleasantries with each of those welcoming him. Accompanying General Chen were his wife, Ms. Tan Xiang, along with their six sons and daughters, who disembarked from the ship in an orderly fashion.</p>
<p>Chen's Remarks</p>
<p>General Chen told this reporter: His arrival was to seek treatment for duodenal disease and dental ailments. The reorganization of troops and the adjustment of various levels of the former Naval Department had also been considered for some time, but there was nothing to announce at present. However, he plans to hold a public reception for the press in the near future to speak freely. He then took his family by car to their residence on Linsen West Road to rest.</p>
<p>Welcoming Personnel</p>
<p>Those who went to the pier yesterday to welcome them included Mayor Qian, Special Commissioner Zhao Zhiyao of the Military Affairs Ministry's Nanjing-Shanghai Area, Deputy Chief Zhou Xianzhang of the Naval Affairs Office, Director Wei Jimin of the Naval Affairs Office's Shanghai Office, Commander Luo Youlun of the Youth Army 207th Division, Commander Rong Youlue of the Shanghai Municipal Defense General Corps, Deputy Commander Li Jilan of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Director Sun Qinchi of the Municipal Government's General Affairs Office, and Director Chen Shiquan of the Land Administration Bureau, among others.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Inventory of Seized Enemy Property Should Be Created <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Upon investigating enemy and puppet properties, according to the Executive Yuan's regulations, they should be handled uniformly by the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau. Before the establishment of the Bureau's Enemy Property Division, many properties were sealed off and occupied by various parties, often leading to disputes over issues such as housing. At the same time, the families of traitors were also able to take advantage of this chaotic situation to conceal and evade their property. Furthermore, unscrupulous individuals, taking advantage of their influence, forcibly occupied or shielded enemy property, thereby pursuing their attempts to fish in troubled waters, making investigation and handling extremely difficult. It is understood that the Administration Bureau, in order to comply with regulations, unify authority, improve efficiency, and eliminate malfeasance, has formally issued a public announcement as of today and has sent letters to relevant authorities stating that if there is any enemy property that has been previously seized, sealed off, or occupied, a detailed inventory must be created and transferred to the Bureau for handling by February 10th. However, if the previous handling agencies truly need the property for official purposes, they may still complete the procedures to temporarily borrow it. If the inventory is not transferred by the deadline, or if any unauthorized seizure, sealing off, or occupation occurs after the Bureau's approval has not been obtained, it will be considered a crime of forcibly occupying enemy property.</p>

<p>The China Textile Construction Company will, starting today, take over another sixteen factories related to the textile industry. Among them are six woolen mills: Hongkang, Yongdian, Huaxing, Zhonghe, Gongda, and Shanghai Factory No. 6; seven dyeing and weaving factories: Yida, Zhonghua, Huimei, Huaqiang, Xinghua, Guizhou, and Meihua; and three hemp factories: Rihua Factory No. 1 and 2, Shanghai Factory No. 1 and 2, and Dongya. The transfer will be carried out by the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. However, most personnel will not be changed, only the factories will be reorganized under the Textile Construction Company system for unified management. In addition, there are more than twenty enemy and puppet hosiery factories that the company can take over. However, most of these hosiery factories are small in scale, which makes management inconvenient. Therefore, whether to take them over is under consideration, and it is expected that a part will be transferred to private operation.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Foreigners Requesting Soviet Citizenship Increase Sharply; Soviet Ship Reported to Arrive in Shanghai <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Soviet Consulate General in this city has been busy processing passport applications recently. Most of those applying for Soviet citizenship are White Russians in this city, with some people from Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia. In the past seventeen days alone, the number of applicants has exceeded six thousand, while the total number of applicants during the war was only about two thousand, a significant increase. According to the consulate staff, they will speed up the registration process so that passports can be issued as soon as possible. There is no deadline for registration. The registration process only started three weeks ago. It is said that an average of about five hundred people register every day, and it is rumored that a Soviet ship named "Shanfu" will soon arrive in this city, the first Soviet ship to arrive in Shanghai in several years.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Power Company Officials State: Reasonable Demands Will Be Considered; Labor Refuses to Insist on Negotiations at the Factory <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[Our Report] The labor dispute at the power company has been deadlocked for five days. Yesterday, because the workers' representatives no longer insisted that the management come to the factory for negotiations, there was a turnaround in resolving the strike. However, the workers' representatives insisted on no longer negotiating with the original representatives, Luo Gen (British) and Tao Yingjie, because the workers believed that the two were deceiving the general manager, Faires. Yesterday, the factory invited reporters and asked them to convey this message to Faires so that direct negotiations could proceed quickly.</p>
<p>**Labor and Management to Meet Soon**</p>
<p>The reporter visited Mr. Hopkins, the general manager of the company, yesterday. According to him, he is willing to represent the company and announce that any reasonable demands from the workers will be considered and accepted, such as the reinstatement of dismissed workers and the adjustment of salaries. However, he has only seen these conditions in the newspaper and has not received any formal request from the workers, so he feels confused and puzzled. This point can be clarified after a direct meeting between the two parties today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>**Workers' Representatives Offer Explanation**</p>
<p>The workers' representatives also said yesterday that they do not have any excessive demands, so they hope that the management will not reduce them using the usual bargaining tactics. The reason they insisted that the negotiation location must be inside the factory is because they have negotiated outside the factory with the management many times, but without gaining a key understanding. Therefore, everyone is demanding that the management come to the factory so that they can understand the progress of the negotiations and know whether the representatives are doing their best. If there are any disputes, they can convene a general meeting at any time to discuss and decide whether to accept or reject them. They also solemnly stated that Shen Han, a director of the union, was not stealing electricity. The reason was that Shen's neighbor, the Ouya Barber Shop, had damaged wires and connected them to Shen's meter without permission. In fact, even if Shen agreed, they would still pay according to the rules, so the charge of stealing electricity is simply unfounded.</p>
<p>**Hope for Understanding from the Mediator**</p>
<p>Regarding the ten dismissed workers, none of them are temporary workers, and two of them have been serving for more than twenty years, and another has been serving for ten years. Therefore, at this time of work shortage, the management has no reason to dismiss them casually on the pretext of "not needing" them. Regarding Wang Xianqing, a member of the Municipal Party Committee who is responsible for mediation, they are deeply satisfied with him. They said that they can guarantee with their lives that they did not kidnap Wang and obstruct his freedom. However, because they did not follow Wang's advice to resume work before negotiating, it may have made Wang feel unhappy, and they hope Wang will understand.</p>
<p>**Department Stores Still Awaiting Mediation**</p>
<p>More than 3,000 employees of nine major department stores in this city, such as Yong'an and Sincere, have been on strike since the 23rd due to failed salary increase requests. Although the authorities have mediated many times, no resolution has been reached. Yesterday morning at 10:00 a.m., Zhang Zhenyuan, the chief of the mediation section of the Social Affairs Bureau, invited representatives of both labor and management to discuss the matter again. The labor side reduced their minimum salary requirement from 34,500 yuan (with meals provided), while the management, based on the decision of the Wage Assessment Committee, set the minimum salary at 30,000 yuan, with employees providing their own meals. If meals are still provided by the company, the food cost of 7,500 yuan will be deducted, so the minimum salary is 22,500 yuan. After Chief Zhang's separate persuasion, the management agreed to raise it to 25,000 yuan (with meals provided), while the labor side still insisted on 34,500 yuan (with meals provided). As no agreement was reached, it was decided to mediate again at 1:00 p.m. today.</p>
<p>**US Military Drivers Resumed Work Yesterday**</p>
<p>The strike of drivers and workers in the US military transportation department has come to an end. The US military authorities made some concessions and agreed to issue salaries in advance today so that they can spend the lunar New Year. At the same time, starting on the first of next month, the salaries of all drivers and workers will be doubled. As a result, more than 1,500 Chinese drivers and workers officially resumed work yesterday.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The February allocation work of the National Shipping Allocation Committee has also been set. Eleven ships will be allocated to the Chongqing-Yichang section. Because it is still in the orange water season, the transportation efficiency may not be increased. Therefore, the allocation volume is 300 people less than in January, set at 6,000 people. The allocation method is: 1,800 people for various agencies, 400 people for civil transport, 2,800 people for returned military transport, and 1,000 other officers and soldiers. It is reported that a second line will be opened for the Chongqing-Beijing return transport.

<p>**Continuous Groundings of Ships on the Yangtze River**</p>
<p>The Yangtze River water level has decreased sharply, making navigation very difficult. According to the shipping industry, the water level in Hankou is as low as 3.7 feet. It has been slightly higher in recent days, but it is still more than four feet lower, resulting in frequent ship groundings. The Changxing ship of the former Sanbei Company was grounded in Dongliu and has now been rescued and launched. It is expected to arrive today. The Jiangshun ship of the China Merchants Bureau was also grounded at the grounding site of the Changxing ship, and the Jiangning ship was also grounded nearby and has not yet been rescued.

<p>Editor: I, being aware of the importance of science, have developed a great interest in it. I have designed a prime mover in my mind that doesn't use fuel but relies on air power, and based on my understanding, it can be successful. However, without practical experimentation, I still lack confidence. There are also more than ten kinds of materials waiting to be researched, but experimentation is financially impossible, and the environment I'm in doesn't suit my interests, nor can I fully find the materials. Therefore, my problem is not easily solved, which also affects my willingness to do other things. To put it simply, I feel very distressed. Now I want to invest in an environment suitable for my interests to research and experiment, but I can't find a way. I respectfully ask you, sir, to guide and introduce me to open my mind so that I can speed up the research. At the same time, I also think that I am definitely not the only one suffering from this same distress, and there must be many others. It would be great if you, sir, could make a strong appeal for us ambitious scientists who are forced to sit in worry due to economic and environmental constraints. Please ask the authorities to establish a scientific experiment and research institute with books containing scientific reference materials and providing experimental instruments, so that our imaginations and diagrams can be used for research and experimentation. This is what we desire most. I specially entrust this to you, and wish you good health. Gao Chenggong</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) Mr. Gao: I am twelve points admirable of youths like you who have scientific minds and enterprising spirits. What you said about not having the economic means and not having a laboratory is indeed not easy to develop your aspirations. China is a country with backward science, but now is the beginning of national construction, and we need a large number of persevering and hardworking youths to work towards science. The original academic equipment was almost completely destroyed by the enemy during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War—I believe it will be slowly built up in the future, so don't be impatient or passive. As for the "prime mover" in your ideal, it is best to first draw a diagram, explain it in detail, and send it to me to introduce it to physicists for review. If it can really become a reality, there is no need to worry about finding a place for experimental production. What do you think?</p>

<p>The money supply in this city was quite tight last week due to (1) the approaching Lunar New Year, with all industries busy settling accounts, and the money industry contracting, with loans only coming in and not going out, (2) most of the old-brand large banks were preparing a 20% deposit reserve, which was transferred to the Central Bank, and (3) the textile and construction companies sold as much coarse and fine cotton yarn and cotton cloth as possible, the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau released 1,500 boxes of rayon, soap, miscellaneous grains, edible oil and other materials, and the Grain Administration Bureau sold 20,000 dan of Wuhu indica rice, absorbing a lot of floating capital. The daily rate for 1,000 yuan of interbank lending in the money industry, although nominally at 3%, the actual interest rate has risen to 1.3%, and the year-end rate is as high as 1.5%. The local money industry is still prohibited from mortgaging. The customs limit the amount of gold jewelry transported to the Northeast to 37.7994 grams, only about 7.6 qian. Northern gangs and securities gangs sold 900,000 yuan at the end of the week, a decrease of 27,000 yuan from the previous week. Foreign banks and money houses sold US dollars in kind. In addition, after the new foreign exchange was announced, the demand will be greatly reduced, and buyers are waiting and watching. The price fell 45 yuan compared with the previous week. The Shantou gang dumped Hong Kong dollars, and both old and new goods fell 10 yuan. The silver market saw a new high price of 800 yuan per tael of silver bullion due to the demand for jewelry from silver shops at the end of the year, the purchase from the Jiangbei gang, and news of Japan raising silver prices. Silver coins were 500 yuan each, and Mexican silver dollars were even more expensive.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Speculative Funds Are at Work, Public Bonds Fall and Chinese Stocks Rise <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The talk of repaying Unified Bonds with Sun Yat-sen banknotes and customs gold gradually revealed an extravagant expectation that was not in line with public opinion. The Sichuan gang banks and securities gangs continued to sell gradually before the end of the year. Grade C bonds hit a low of 1,000 yuan, half of the peak of 2,000 yuan ten days ago. Finally, a major player pushed it up, and it rebounded to 1,300 yuan, a decrease of 400 yuan from the previous week. The remaining Grades A, B, D, and E each fell by 470 to 80 yuan. Chinese stocks rose because of the air of the resumption of trading in the Securities Exchange and the distribution of dividends by textile factories. The Guangdong gang bought 50,000 to 60,000 shares of Wing On Textile Factory, reaching 1,630 yuan at the end of the week, an increase of 200 yuan from the previous week. The remaining large and small popular and unpopular stocks all looked up. Foreign stocks saw a new high price at the beginning of the week. Finally, the lane trading was intervened by the authorities, and the bullish turned to sell before the end of the year, and the Jewish gangs waited and watched. Ewo Silk Factory fell 600 yuan, and Wheelock fell 2,000 yuan, most of which were 100 to 500 yuan less than the previous week.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Overview of Silk and Satin This Week, Silk Goods Market Was Active Yesterday <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Last week, rayon fell back on Tuesday due to the implementation of raw material rationing, and both spot goods and warehouse warrants were announced to fall back. Afterwards, it gradually eased. Spot goods for 120 Tianqiao fluctuated between 1.12 million and 150,000 yuan, which was 20,000 yuan weaker than last Saturday. The warehouse warrants fell in a straight line, which was more than 300,000 yuan less than last Saturday. The factory price was very stable last week, with very little fluctuation, and each grade rose by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Silk and satin were mediocre. Although there were ups and downs in the middle, the difference was very small compared with last Saturday. Meiya quilt cover was up to 775,000 yuan per 100 pieces, and a minimum of 730,000 yuan. Dacheng Gebi crepe was up to 2,470 yuan per yard, and a minimum of 2,220 yuan. Minsheng brocade fluctuated by 500 yuan, and finally was the same as last Saturday. Only Huajin crepe fell by 150 yuan per yard. Yesterday, on Sunday, the silk goods market was very active. Meiya quilt covers were priced at 820,000 yuan per 100 pieces, and Dacheng Gebi crepe was the most popular, with a transaction price of 2,660 yuan per yard. Minsheng Shi brocade was priced at 11,000 yuan per piece according to the original board, and Huajin crepe was sold at a miserable price of 850 yuan per yard due to many people seeking to sell.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Authorities Dumped Stored Goods, Price Increase Was Slightly Suppressed <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Rice and food were first bought by street food households at the end of the year, and speculative big players participated, and thick japonica and indica rice rose above the 10,000 yuan mark. Then, the Grain Administration Office dumped a large number of Wuhu indica rice, asking for 7,500 yuan per dan, and each grade of rice was leveled by it. As a result, it was 200 to 300 yuan up and down from the previous week. What is strange is that each rice store in the market did not have this Wuhu indica rice from the Grain Administration Office, which shows that there are hoarders who have taken it all. Among miscellaneous grains, beans rose by 100 to 200 yuan due to the need for the New Year, peanuts were stable, bean cakes were weak by 50 yuan, and edible oil rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan per dan following the rise of soybean raw materials. Cotton yarn first fell to 1 million yuan for 42 counts and 700,000 yuan for 20 counts due to the continuous sale of cotton yarn by the textile and construction company. Then, due to the prevalence of wage and salary strikes in the yarn factory, the cloth factory and the Xichang guest gang bought back and rose. As a result, only 42 counts rose by 30,000 yuan compared with the previous week, and the rest were flat. Cotton spinning, Shenxin, Rongfeng, Anda, and Tongyi bought it, and the cotton industry was busy closing at the end of the year. Fine lint fell by 5,000 yuan per dan, and seed cotton fell by 500 yuan. Cotton cloth dyeing and weaving factories searched for white blank fine cloth, and each piece rose by 2,000 yuan. Colored cloth and 16-pound coarse cloth had few outlets, and were weak by 1,000 yuan. The arrival of fuel coal blocks has increased slightly, and each ton fell by 10,000 yuan. Coal dust is slightly firm due to wage relations, and coal balls are popular for high-quality goods and weak for inferior goods. Firewood hawkers cross the year to sell, and the price has dropped slightly by 100 yuan. Tea is sold well for New Year gifts, and the Yingkou gang also bought it. Medium flag guns and jasmine green tea each reached 140,000 to 50,000 yuan per dan. Sugar from Taiwan has arrived, and the price of medium sand sold at 440 yuan per catty has softened the hearts of the people. Matches and soap are being searched for by the North China gang and are trending up. Cigarettes are sold well on this street, and the Unified Tax Bureau has increased the tax rate. British and American Yizhong cigarettes have risen by 10%, and the Great Britain brand is particularly popular. Chinese cigarettes have only risen by 50%. The paper industry has been investing in goods by the guest gang. Although it is said that foreign goods have arrived, the market price has reached another peak. White paper has risen to 26,000 yuan per ream. Western medicines are firm, and industrial raw materials are generally flat due to cheap overseas orders. American caustic soda is 220,000 yuan per barrel of 600 catties, which is 50,000 yuan less than the previous week.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Tinplate Rises Again, Wire Nails Have Fallen Back <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>There was once a rumor that tinplate had arrived, and the price had also returned slightly. After confirming that it was not true, the market returned to prosperity. For example, 200-pound double-linked tinplate was sold from 75,000 yuan to 80,000 yuan per box, and yesterday a certain number sold it for 100,000 yuan, setting a new record.</p>
<p>The smooth sales of wire nails in the past two or three months were the best in the big hardware industry. Until recently, transactions have gradually become light, and there is a tendency for prosperity to be difficult to continue. The green factory has been producing an endless stream, and customers' stomachs have been full, and they have temporarily stopped purchasing. Therefore, the market is hovering and there is a slight return wind.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Economic Briefing <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Commercial money houses and banks, in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance, should pay 20% of their deposit balance to the Central Bank as a reserve. According to the Central Bank's banking bureau, as of now, the Shanghai side has received a deposit reserve of 5 billion yuan, which is still increasing.</p>
<p>The Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau has gradually taken over the enemy and puppet import and export trade and business. Among them, the materials that can be exported, such as raw silk, tung oil, leather, etc., are worth hundreds of millions. It is planned to sort out, transport and export them separately, and set up a fifth group in the bureau to be responsible for this.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance previously stipulated that the cigarette tax rate for machine-made cigarettes was 100%, and the tax rate for handmade cigarettes was 60%. Now, in order to promote the improvement of handmade cigarettes, the tax authorities have revised the tax rate for handmade cigarettes to 100% from this month.</p>
<p>The latest tax regulations of the Guangdong Customs are that all goods imported from Hong Kong must be taxed, even if they are domestic products. Only domestic products shipped to the province by the original ship and not loaded and unloaded in Hong Kong can be granted tax-free treatment. Therefore, Shanghai and Guangdong merchants plan to transport them directly internally to avoid trouble.</p>
<p>The Guangdong Customs' tax revenue in September last year was more than 4 million yuan, more than 16 million in October, four times more than in September, 150 million in November, and more than 300 million in December.</p>
<p>The Jing'an Temple Office of the Postal Savings Bureau is located at No. 9 Haige Road and will open on the 28th.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will put a large number of kerosene on sale from now on.</p>
<p>The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration will sell a large number of steel pipes, which were recently shipped from the United States. The inner diameter is about 6 inches, about 9 tons, a total of 400, about 10,000 feet in total length, but the pipe has no attachments and reducing sections, and there are no threads at both ends. Those who want to buy can contact the finance department of the department from now on.</p>
<p>The China National Federation of Industries suggested to the National Bank that since most of the equipment of factories and mines is old, and there has been little opportunity to supplement and replace them during the Anti-Japanese War, when factories and mines order foreign equipment, they should separately collect a percentage of the payment for the goods, issue letters of credit or provide guarantees, and pay for the goods on behalf of the equipment upon arrival, and recover the money in installments. It is heard that the National Bank is forwarding the letter to the relevant parties for review.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, the small machinery factories established in the accompanying capital were all shut down. The authorities recently approved the closure of the fourth, fifth and sixth batches and purchased their equipment, so that a total of 89 factories could dismiss their employees. Most of them are machinery factories, and the rest are electrical appliance factories. Thirteen factories have partially suspended operations, and the rest have completely suspended operations.</p>
<h3 id="e72">An Example of Filling in Book Capital <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] Since the implementation of industrial and commercial registration, the issue of filling in the amount of capital has been a problem because the instructions of the Ministry have not yet been issued. Recently, Sun Rui and others from the Shanghai Paint and Wood Industry Rectification Committee have proposed that the industry is similar to contracting and has no fixed capital. It is planned to fill in the value of the existing surplus materials and the property in the store according to the current currency. It has been approved.</p>
<h3 id="e73">The Exchange Rate Has Not Been Determined, It Is Difficult for the Import and Export Industry to Develop, It Is Said That White Paper Will Arrive Next Month <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] All the importers and exporters in Shanghai are waiting for the publication of the exchange rate.</p>
<p>The first to receive foreign orders were Chinese medicinal materials stores. After the victory, the prices in Shanghai generally fell, but the so-called "Yingkou goods" among Chinese medicines were an exception because there was a way to Australia. The so-called "Yingkou goods" are named after the transshipment in Yingkou. Most of them are produced in the northeastern provinces. Unexpectedly, the order in the Northeast has not been restored after the victory, and Yingkou has become an important military stronghold. Therefore, the source of goods is cut off, and even the needs of this street cannot be supplied, let alone exports. However, medicinal material merchants said that they are unwilling to take the extremely high risk to do export business before the exchange rate is determined.</p>
<p>Among the American import and export firms, Haining Foreign Company can be a representative. Their Beauty brand candy, which was produced before the war, has long been famous in Shanghai, but their search for eggs in various parts of our country and transportation to Europe and the United States (especially the United Kingdom) has a longer history and a larger scale. Recently, they have ordered a large number of white paper from the United States, and the first batch can arrive in Shanghai next month. Now, the firm has resumed business, and Mr. Haining, the American person in charge, has also arrived in Shanghai, but it is still not easy to promote business. The largest source of eggs is the Jinpu Line area, and it is currently impossible to send people to purchase them in the Jinpu Line area. Although paper will be available soon, they also find it difficult to determine the most accurate price before the exchange rate is published.</p>
<p>Before the war, Jardine Matheson was a company that specialized in "producing" the director-general of the Public Concession Public Bureau. In the era when foreigners held consular jurisdiction, their power was really hot. Now the second branch in Chongqing has moved to Shanghai, but first, like Swire, the right to navigate inland rivers has been cancelled, and the previously popular "Swire ship" and "Jardine ship" will become historical terms. They said, "We have ships and people, and China is currently feeling the lack of transportation and talent. We always hope to give us a chance." Among the export departments of Jardine Matheson, silk is a very important department. Some have been shipped out after the war, but after they get a US dollar, they can only "borrow" 500 yuan in legal currency from the Shanghai Bank of China, and the procedures are quite troublesome. If you look at it purely from the perspective of profit, it is more profitable to sell silk in Shanghai than to transport it to the United States, because the price of silk in Shanghai is already quite high, and after the transaction, you can receive all the goods to provide for turnover. Ordinary people may think that after domestic goods are sold in foreign countries, they may be able to use this money to buy foreign goods back, so not only can they avoid the impact of the delayed publication of the exchange rate, but also the profit can be more abundant. However, that senior official of Jardine Matheson told me that this is not allowed by the government. He also said that import transactions are also extremely difficult. The first is that foreign ships are currently also subject to control, and the second is that the funds in British and American banks are still frozen, and you can't buy anything without money.

<p>[This City News] Students from more than 20 schools, including Soochow University, University of Shanghai, Utopia University, and St. John's University in this city, have initiated a student aid fund-raising campaign because they are aware that tuition fees will inevitably rise several times in the next semester, and more than 5,000 students will drop out of school.

<p>[New Shanghai News] Since the soaring of prices, the number of out-of-school children in Shanghai has increased year by year. Schools cannot unreasonably increase tuition fees to make up for the shortfall, and thus their finances are in a precarious situation. In addition, some school administrators only seek personal gain and lack a deep interest in education or a true understanding of educational principles. Seeing that the education business is no longer as profitable as it once was, and unwilling to reduce their own comfortable lifestyles, they resort to changing their approach, considering salary cuts and layoffs. Recently, some private elementary school principals in Shanghai have been using capitalist tactics to oppress teachers, resulting in the innocent dismissal and unemployment of teachers who work for a sacred cause. Furthermore, meager salaries that cannot sustain personal livelihoods have become almost universal. If this situation continues, where will the living security of teachers be? The Shanghai Elementary School Teachers Joint Advancement Association, in view of this, held the first board meeting of the Elementary School Teachers Living Security Promotion Association yesterday (the 27th) at Yucai Middle School on Shanhai Pass Road, to draft documents and make a general appeal to all sectors of society.</p>

<p>[Dahua News Agency, Guangzhou] The Guangdong Provincial Government, in light of the large number of private middle schools that have not yet resumed classes since the victory, has formulated measures for handling private middle schools that have not resumed classes. They are required to develop resumption plans by the end of February of the 35th year (1946) through the school board, send personnel to prepare for resumption, and report for record. They are also required to resume classes before the autumn of the 35th year (1946). Those who fail to comply will be considered to have automatically closed, and their school board registration and school registration will be revoked, and they will not be allowed to use the school name to enroll students in the future.

As for private middle schools that have automatically closed, their school properties will be liquidated by local county and city governments in conjunction with the school board, and reported for approval. The school board and school seals should be cut off and handed over for cancellation.

<p>[Our Newspaper] The Lixin Accounting School in this city was founded by Mr. Pan Xulun. When the Pacific War broke out, it moved to Beibei, Sichuan, and was approved by the Ministry of Education to open classes. It also established an evening accounting school in downtown Chongqing to facilitate the studies of working youth, and the school's operations were quite vigorous. Now, after a resolution by the school board, it will cease enrolling new students from this spring and return to Shanghai. However, in order to take care of the educational needs of young people in Sichuan, the current senior vocational courses will be expanded into a senior accounting vocational school to continue cultivating accounting talents in the southwest. On the Shanghai side, after the decision to return to school, it is also actively planning expansion. It is reported that this spring, it plans to recruit 100 new students with high school diplomas or equivalent qualifications, divided into day and night classes. The duration of study is set at two years for the day class and two and a half years for the night class. There is also an attached accounting training course that graduates in one and a half years. Originally, there were 80 public-funded students subsidized by the Ministry of Education, with full tuition and board fees waived. It is now planned to apply to the Ministry of Education in Shanghai this spring to recruit a number of such students. However, the school's existing campus on Henan Road is insufficient to accommodate them, so Mr. Pan Xulun has donated five of his private houses on Rue Poussin to the school as part of its campus. It is also reported that the school plans to be renamed a business school in the near future and add a five-year accounting specialization program. It is currently working on raising a construction fund of 500 million yuan in stages. The first phase plans to raise about 200 million yuan first, and then gradually build school buildings on the Hongqiao Road campus purchased before the war, so as to last forever.</p>

<p>The first graduating class of the Research Department of the China Journalism College, because they have been together for a long time and are about to separate, held a teacher-student party at the school on Rue Albert yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>Yu Zhong, the principal of Shengcheng Elementary School in this city, in order to commemorate alumnus Zhang Haigen who died for the country (that is, during the August 13th Incident, which caused a sensation in the city, he participated in the 2149th Boy Scout Regiment Special Service Team. He served in the 55th Division of the Army in Pudong and died from shrapnel wounds.), has set up a total of twenty-four Zhang Haigen Scholarship free places in each grade (i.e., three in each grade). Students from poor families with excellent character and academic performance can go to the school's academic affairs office at 507 Jiashan Road every morning to obtain application forms for free admission.</p>
<p>Yan Zhuanlin, the training director of Zhiyi Elementary School in Dazhongli, Zhongzheng North First Road, in memory of his deceased sister Pei Zhen, generously donated eight scholarship amounts. The method: select the best-performing students among the new students applying to the school in this session, and waive half of their tuition and miscellaneous fees. If the admitted students perform well in the future, Mr. Yan is willing to continue to subsidize them until graduation. Those who wish to apply for the Pei Zhen Scholarship can quickly register at the school.</p>
<p>Zhongzheng Night Middle School in this city has already ended this semester. The next semester is scheduled to start on February 18, and new students will continue to be recruited, divided into first-year junior high and first-year senior high classes. Registration will begin on February 6, at Yucai Middle School on Shanhai Pass Road. It is reported that the school tuition is free, and only a small amount of miscellaneous fees are charged.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning's football league was not held due to venue issues. In the afternoon, the Class A match between Qingbai and Hequn was held as scheduled. Qingbai was even stronger yesterday with the help of Cao Qiuting, but the absence of Li Yichen and Fei Chunhua was a mixed blessing. As a result, Qingbai defeated Jinqun by a score of five to one.</p>
<p>After the start, Qingbai's attack was very sharp. Hequn worked hard to defend. At seven minutes, Qingbai's Gu Yisa broke through alone and succeeded in one fell swoop, scoring the first goal. Later, Qingbai's attack became even more vigorous. At twenty minutes, Gao Baozheng passed the ball to Luo Shoufu, and Xiao Luo shot hard and hit the target. In less than two minutes, Hequn's Qian Changrong awarded a penalty kick, which was taken by Cao Qiuting. In the first half, the score was four to one, with Qingbai winning. In the second half, at twenty minutes, Cao Qiuting's corner kick came at just the right time, and Meng Yiliang headed the ball straight into the goal, making the score five to one. Afterwards, Qingbai seemed to be slack, and until the end of the game, both sides did not score again. The final result was five to one.</p>

<p>Special Issue on Production and Construction</p>
<h3 id="e86">Editorial Purpose <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, various construction projects need to be actively launched. In the past few months, because everything needs considerable time to return to normal, there has been no concrete result to date.</p>
<p>However, we must not wait, we must not delay, we must step up our work and move forward. Among the various construction projects, economic construction is the focus of all construction, and it is the priority of all construction. If we want to promote economic construction, then engaging in production is imperative. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once said in the Supreme Economic Committee: "In carrying out this important construction and development work, this committee must recognize the problems of our country and must not only hope that other countries will help solve them. We must help ourselves." The so-called helping ourselves is nothing more than "self-reliance." If we want to be "self-reliant," then the most reasonable way is to work hard to produce, and then enter the stage of construction through production.</p>
<p>At present, there are many difficulties and problems in engaging in production. But because of this, we need to discuss and study together, so that we can open up a path in the midst of thousands of hardships; and sort out a thread in the midst of thousands of things. Therefore, at this time, publishing a special issue on production and construction once a week can enable the industrial sector engaged in production to express their opinions and provide research and reference for all parties; describe difficulties and enable the government to provide assistance; and introduce world trends so as to encourage progress. The mission of this publication lies in these three points: but to complete the mission of this publication, we also need the cooperation and correction of readers.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Mr. Qian Changzhao Talks About: The Style of Industrial Construction <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Wen</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Qian Changzhao, Deputy Director of the Resources Committee, gave a speech saying that the style of industrial construction should be "large, fast, and early." He explained the "large" point, saying that in the past, China's construction was too scattered, and in the future, we should build the new China on a large scale. Only with grand strokes can we meet the great era. We should use people when we should use them, and we should use money when we should use it. Regarding the "fast" point, China's construction in the past was too slow. The environment was certainly not good, but the general fear of taking responsibility and not seeking merit, but seeking no fault, was also a very important reason. In the future, people who are responsible for economic construction must have the courage to take responsibility and move forward. Even if there are some mistakes in the process of economic construction, the government and society should forgive them. Regarding the "early" point, China's construction in the past was often pushed too late, looking left and right, and not daring to start. Therefore, we missed the time. In the future, construction must have a spirit of experimentation. If a thing has a 60-70% chance of success, it must be promoted. The perfect environment will never come.</p>
<p>The three points of large, fast, and early that Mr. Qian said are in fact a whole planning problem. With a plan, it can be easily implemented. The biggest mistake Chinese people make in doing things is that they do not have concrete plans. At this time, planning should be more in line with the environment. With a plan, it can be implemented in the three ways of large, fast, and early.</p>
<p>Regarding the whole plan, we can refer to the written opinion recently issued by President Song for the China Textile Construction Company on the situation of Japanese yarn and cloth in foreign markets. The original text said: "Before this war, Japan's yarn and cloth market in foreign countries was about 300 million US dollars per year. Most of the raw materials used were obtained from our country. Each group of Japanese textile industry must have competition among themselves in their own country, but in foreign countries, they take unified action. Whether in transportation, finance, or insurance, the government and various enterprise organizations form a whole. Thus, the profit and loss belong to the whole calculation, so they can have such success?"</p>
<p>The situation described by President Song is exactly what the Chinese industrial sector should do now. If we implement it according to that situation, we can adopt the "large, fast, and early" style and achieve success.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Building Light Industry and Wood Thread Industry <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Liqun</p>
<p>In order to make readers understand the situation of each factory, this publication will introduce the past efforts and future direction of a factory in each issue. This issue is specially invited Mr. Luo Liqun, the person in charge of China Flying Wheel Thread Factory, to write an article to explain the situation of the wood thread industry — Editor</p>
<p>1. Building a Country and National Industrialization</p>
<p>Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the work that should be done head-on is to industrialize the country. In advanced countries, high-speed industrial equipment has advanced to the atomic age, but in our country, because of the war, even a little bit of weak industrial foundation has been destroyed. For the sake of the next hundred years, we really should immediately start to work hard on the task of national industrialization.</p>
<p>2. Heavy Industry and Light Industry</p>
<p>The construction of national industrialization can be divided into two aspects: national defense industry and people's livelihood industry. National defense industry is heavy industry, such as shipbuilding, railways, aviation, automobiles, steelmaking, etc., which requires huge capital, abundant resources, and outstanding talents, and needs the promotion of the government and the assistance of allied countries. People's livelihood industry is light industry, such as textiles, thread making, paper making, etc., which is relatively easy to achieve with the strength of our national capital. Therefore, from the standpoint of those of us engaged in industry, the most important work is to first work hard on the construction of light industry in our own position. With the large population and large consumption of our country, we can first achieve self-sufficiency, and then develop outwards. Therefore, if we work hard, the future of China's light industry is unlimited.</p>
<p>3. From the Textile Industry, Discuss the Importance of the Wood Thread Industry</p>
<p>Among the general people's livelihood industries, the textile industry can be said to be the most important, because the textile industry can solve one of the four major elements of life—clothing. To make or a piece of clothing, there must be thread. In the handicraft era, we had domestic silk thread and native yarn available, so wood thread was not valued. However, the technology of making clothes has progressed to using sewing machines instead of hand-making. At the same time, because of the development of urban industry, Western-style clothes have gradually become popular, and wood thread has become a necessity for making clothes. Its use has reached every household from the clothing industry, and the sales are wide. Therefore, the British-made Lien Tiao brand and the Russian-made Earth brand were sold all over the world before the war, and were imported in large quantities. Even in poor rural areas, they were household names.</p>
<p>4. The Budding of National Products</p>
<p>Around 1925-26, because of the wide sales of the Lien Tiao brand, it gradually attracted the attention of Chinese people, who started to manufacture it. However, because the capital, equipment, and raw materials of the domestic wood thread industry were not as good as imported products, they failed one after another.</p>
<p>The China Flying Wheel Thread Factory happened to be established in 1927 to compete with foreign goods. At that time, the Flying Wheel brand was highly trusted in the market, and gradually reversed the decline of the domestic wood thread industry. Unexpectedly, the Cotton &amp; Hua Yang Company used the special rights of foreigners in China to set up a factory in Shanghai to manufacture the Fortune Peach brand wood thread, competing with the Flying Wheel. It used its strong capital to adopt a sales policy of buying one ro and giving two dozen as a means to plunder the market, giving the domestic Flying Wheel industry serious pressure. At that time, although the Flying Wheel Factory was at a disadvantage in terms of capital disparity, it did not retreat. At the same time, the author went to North China, Northeast China, Guangzhou and Hong Kong and other places to investigate, and opened up another sales channel to maintain production, while constantly improving the technology and making various preparations.</p>
<p>5. The Rise of National Products</p>
<p>After a period of silence, the domestic wood thread industry saw the increasingly tense situation in the European War in 1938, and foreign goods gradually became scarce in China. When the war broke out, overseas Chinese businessmen in Nanyang were motivated by patriotic enthusiasm and came to Shanghai to purchase domestic goods one after another, giving the domestic wood thread industry a chance to revive. The Flying Wheel Factory, after more than ten years of hard work and research, had improved its production technology to be no less than that of foreign goods, and its production equipment was also becoming more and more complete. Because of the achievements in production equipment work, it was greatly welcomed by overseas Chinese businessmen, and the sales in Singapore, Java, Borneo, Sumatra, Siam, Myanmar, Vietnam, and other islands in Nanyang, and even as far as South America, had a tendency to exceed demand, and its reputation was comparable to that of the Lien Tiao brand. At that time, not only the Flying Wheel Factory, but also other thread factories, benefited from the overseas Chinese businessmen and showed a significant flourishing atmosphere.</p>
<p>6. Surviving in Difficulties</p>
<p>Just when the domestic wood thread industry was thriving, the Pacific War broke out, and sales in various parts of Nanyang were suddenly cut off. At that time, because the war zone in the country was expanding, the Japanese invaders vigorously implemented a blockade policy, followed by the puppet government's purchase of yarn and cloth. The domestic wood thread industry was subjected to the dual devastation of sales and raw materials. They all held a negative attitude, thinking that they had fallen into a desperate situation, and closed down or switched to other industries one after another. At that time, the Flying Wheel Factory was of course unavoidable from the same encounter and the same misfortune, but it was never pessimistic. On the one hand, it reduced production, and on the other hand, it launched and developed in this city, and worked hard to promote sales. Finally, because of its excellent quality, it first advanced to Yong'an, Sincere, New New China National Goods and other companies, and then expanded to various Chinese and foreign department stores. In less than a year, the Flying Wheel brand wood thread could be seen everywhere in the city. Although it could not be as prosperous as the period when it was exported to Nanyang, it could also occupy the top spot in the city.</p>
<p>At the same time, in addition to painstakingly maintaining its inherent position, it also silently expanded production preparations, purchased factory sites, added self-made wood thread machines, self-prepared dyeing, and pre-set splicing thread bobbins, cone bobbins, and automatic machines and other precision machinery, hoping to become the only thread factory in the country with perfect equipment after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>7. Future Work and Tasks</p>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the standard of living will inevitably be considerably improved. In the past, in order to live and save materials, we wore broken yellow clothes, and now it is time for us to change our clothes. At the same time, the construction of the country also needs the efforts of the thread making industry, so the prospects for thread making can be said to be just beginning to flourish.</p>
<p>8. Export Trade and Competition with Foreign Goods</p>
<p>Our construction of light industry should not be satisfied with self-sufficiency. We should win back the money that has been lost for the country and lay a strong foundation for the country. Therefore, we must pay attention to export trade. Nanyang is the best target for us to strive for export trade, because overseas Chinese in Nanyang are more enthusiastic about patriotism than those in the country, and Nanyang has a vast territory and a large population, and needs are urgent, so as long as the quality is excellent, it will not be difficult to develop.</p>
<p>In the country, we have two hopes. On the one hand, we must pay attention to the re-import of foreign countries. We must work hard to improve the quality so that it can be comparable to foreign countries. On the other hand, we hope that Chinese people will cherish the products of manufacturers operated by Chinese people, so that domestic products can be widely sold and promoted, and the result is still that Chinese people benefit themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e89">The Merits of the TVA Organization <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Ying</p>
<p>TVA is the abbreviation for the Tennessee Valley Authority in the United States. Established twelve years ago, it is one of the outstanding achievements of the late President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a visionary American statesman. It not only revitalized a vast, undeveloped region of America and rescued the American economy from panic, but also contributed greatly to the democratic arsenal during this great war.</p>
<p>China's Yangtze River Three Gorges hydropower project is already underway. Its future is of great importance to China's future industrialization and the fate of the people's lives and wealth.</p>
<p>Regarding the TVA's organization, two points are worth highlighting and can serve as a reference for general industries. These are that the authority has advisors, a secretary, and a general manager under the board of directors, and under the general manager, there are a director-general of publicity and a director-general of budget. Below these are various working departments.</p>
<p>The fact that the authority has specifically established directors-general for publicity and budget demonstrates the importance it places on these areas. This is precisely what the Chinese industrial sector generally neglects.</p>
<p>The Chinese industrial sector has always overlooked publicity, believing that it is not important. This is evident in the general practice of factories refusing visitors, which illustrates the neglect of publicity work. No factory has any secrets that need to be kept. The strengths of a factory can be used as a reference for outsiders or fellow businesses, which will lead to progress. Furthermore, the need for transparency necessitates proper and organized management. Therefore, the industrial sector should welcome visits and accept external criticism.</p>
<p>At the same time, publicity work can be divided into two aspects: external and internal. External publicity involves explaining the need and value of a particular industry, attracting social attention and sympathy. Internal publicity can make employees understand that the work they are participating in is meaningful and valuable. With internal and external consistency, rapid development can be achieved. Furthermore, publicity should be based entirely on facts, and good publicity requires good factual performance. Good factual performance is progress.</p>
<p>Regarding the budget, it is closely related to the success or failure of an enterprise. However, Chinese industries generally only have estimations, not budgets. Even if there is a budget, it is a partial budget. Therefore, it is impossible to study the difference between the final accounts and the budget.</p>
<p>With a budget, a concrete plan can be formulated. For example, if a project is to be completed in five years, it becomes a five-year plan. This five-year plan is part of the budgeting work.</p>
<p>Moreover, budgeting and publicity can complement each other. Based on the budget, facts can be communicated through publicity. The budget and publicity become the soul of the entire organization. With the division of labor and cooperation among various departments, progress can naturally be smooth. Therefore, the merits of the TVA are worth emulating.</p>
<h3 id="e90">The Budding Underwear Industry <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Fu Liangjun</p>
<p>Speaking of the underwear industry, its history is not long. It is only in the last decade or so that Chinese people have started wearing Western clothing, which has gradually become popular. When wearing Chinese clothing, underwear was not particularly important, and sewing machines were not needed. The start of the underwear industry, like other industries, gradually expanded from a very humble position. In the beginning, only one or two people were needed to buy raw materials and engage in cutting and sewing to produce goods. There was no talk of quality or standards at all. Therefore, those engaged in underwear manufacturing did not have long-term vision or sufficient knowledge.</p>
<p>However, times are progressing. Due to the increasing demand from all aspects, the production volume of underwear has gradually increased. As the public's ability to discern quality gradually strengthens, underwear manufacturing must gradually pay attention to technology and standards.</p>
<p>Recalling the establishment of the Xinguang Standard Underwear Factory more than ten years ago, it was simply because there was a need for better shirts on the market. We operated it in our spare time. Because the demand increased day by day, and because we focused on quality, the organization gradually expanded, and sales gradually became widespread. As a result, the underwear sector became an industry in itself. At its peak, there were more than one hundred companies in the same industry.</p>
<p>The underwear business has now reached a point where it is recognized by all sectors as a novel and promising enterprise. From its inception to the present, it has gone through many difficulties and setbacks. However, each difficulty has strengthened the determination to move forward because no business can develop in a straight line.</p>
<p>Taking the Xinguang Standard Underwear Factory as an example, at the beginning of the war of resistance against Japan, it had already been selling to various parts of Southeast Asia, where it occupied an excellent position. However, after the outbreak of the Pacific War, transportation was cut off, and it had to be sold domestically. Although the impact on the industry was not as great as on Xinguang, the situation was the same. What followed was the government monopoly of cotton cloth, which brought production to a near standstill.</p>
<p>Originally, there are two ways to run a business: one is to adapt to the environment, and the other is to create the environment. When the future is uncertain, the only way to overcome all difficulties is to create the environment. After the government monopoly of cotton cloth was implemented, in order to achieve the expected goals, we spared no effort to build the Xinguang Standard Underwear Dyeing and Weaving Factory, so that raw materials could be self-supplied. Therefore, the quality was more guaranteed, the output was no longer a problem, and society had a deeper understanding of the underwear industry. The efforts of the industry are also an important factor in this.</p>
<p>As for the future of the underwear industry, I believe it is just beginning to flourish. As the number of people wearing Western clothing will increase day by day, as long as both quality and quantity can be taken into account and progress is made together, domestic sales will definitely increase day by day. At the same time, there is great potential for exports because "clothing" is one of the four essential elements of life. Recently, President Song published a written statement in Shanghai, saying that the government has instructed the China Textile Construction Corporation to lead the textile industry in a short period of time. At the same time, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and other Chinese shipping companies' foreign routes, the state bank's foreign exchange bank, and China's insurance companies will jointly assist in order to obtain the 300 million US dollars worth of Japanese yarn that used to be on the market abroad every year.</p>
<p>Manufacturing underwear not only requires yarn and cloth as raw materials, but also the price of underwear includes the labor wages of workers who make the underwear. Therefore, if underwear is exported, it can not only obtain the profits that should be obtained on yarn and cloth, but also obtain the wages needed by Chinese workers from abroad. Therefore, if the underwear business can be coordinated with all aspects, the future is quite bright. On the occasion of the founding of the Shen Bao Production and Construction Weekly, the editor asked me to contribute an article, so I have described the general situation to encourage my colleagues in the industry.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Mr. Hu Xiyuan Talks About the Situation in the Industrial Sector <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>In order to let all parties know about the situation in the industrial sector, this publication intends to maintain regular contact with the industrial sector and listen to opinions. Recently, we interviewed Mr. Hu Xiyuan, who had just arrived in Shanghai from the rear. Mr. Hu moved his factory to Sichuan when the war started in 1937. He only arrived in Shanghai two weeks ago. He really was the first to leave and the last to return. Therefore, he has personally experienced all the hardships of the industrial sector in the rear during the War of Resistance and knows them in the most detail.</p>
<p>We used a conversational approach, from the industrial sector in the rear during the War of Resistance to the prospects of the industrial sector in the future, as well as the expectations of the industrial sector for people from all walks of life. Now, we have summarized Mr. Hu's opinions into the following points.</p>
<p>The Industrial Sector in the Rear During the War of Resistance</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, many factories moved to the rear with the government. The general idea was to contribute their strength to the government to enhance the power of resistance. Therefore, many talented people went to the rear and buried themselves in hard work. Some directly participated in the work of resisting Japan, such as manufacturing military supplies. Some indirectly participated in the work of resisting Japan, such as making extensive use of substitutes (for example, the copper used in light bulbs could be used to make cartridge cases, so magnetic lamp holders were used). At the same time, due to the lack of materials, everything was ten times more difficult than usual. For example, due to the lack of coal, several factories had to gather together and go directly to the coal-producing areas to dig coal. Many projects originally required the use of metal products, but had to be replaced with wood, and they went to forests hundreds of miles away to select wood. All substitutes that could be used were used. For example, turpentine oil was used to replace rosin, and synthetic gasoline was used to replace gas. There are countless examples like this. Therefore, the industrial sector only sought to cope with the environment and could no longer seek progress in technology. However, this kind of environmental control broke the unbreakable bad habit of generally sticking to old methods. Previously, many engineers who manufactured goods would not use anything other than a specified product. Even if it was the same British product, they would not use it if the brand was changed. However, during the War of Resistance, there were no foreign goods available at all, so they turned their attention to all the materials available in China and utilized them.</p>
<p>Industrial Bankruptcy After Victory</p>
<p>In the early days of the War of Resistance, most factories operated according to the right track, hoping to obtain legitimate profits in addition to operating. However, due to the decreasing use of materials and inflation, prices rose day by day, so the figures on the books became increasingly large, but the actual inventory of the factory became increasingly weak. Originally, one hundred kinds of goods could be manufactured, but after the goods were sold, only the raw materials for eighty goods could be replenished. After several turns, the numbers became larger and larger, and the foundation of the factory became more and more dangerous. At the same time, due to the large numbers, the profits were very substantial on the surface, and the government's tax revenue also became a very large amount. Many factories, in order to pay taxes, even borrowed from the financial sector and then paid taxes, or sold machinery to raise money to cope with the situation. This situation of "virtual profit and actual tax" lasted for several years, and by the end of the War of Resistance, the industrial sector in the rear was already very dangerous. After the victory came, the price of goods plummeted, and it became unmanageable. Most factories could not survive and could not die. To survive, they really had no strength. To die, they could not even raise money for liquidation fees. In this situation, they only hoped that the government could sympathize with those factories and the contributions they made to the government during the War of Resistance. They moved to the rear because they really wanted to fulfill a little of their national responsibility. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, their businesses have reached a point where they cannot survive. If the government does not provide assistance, then the industrial sector will have to sacrifice many hardworking members, and many hardworking specialized talents will be displaced. Therefore, helping the industrial sector in the rear is closely related to the future of the country.</p>
<p>Future Industrial Development Should Be Balanced</p>
<p>Regarding the future of industry, it should be distributed evenly throughout the country. Concentrating it in one place is not a good idea. The industrial sector in Shanghai can distribute their businesses to at least the Yangtze River basin. This will gradually improve land prices and living standards in various places, and prevent the formation of prosperity in one place due to the distorted development of one area.</p>
<p>Regarding the management of industry, as long as you work hard and bury yourself in hard work, the future is promising. Because regarding capital, if it is not enough, you can attract idle funds in the market. As long as the factory is run effectively, people are willing to invest. Regarding technology, you may wish to adopt the latest methods from advanced countries. You can hire foreign technicians and send specialized talents abroad to study, training talents in batches. Then, although we cannot compete with foreign factories, we will at least not lag behind to what extent. Therefore, the industrial sector in the future must hold on to their positions and work hard, but this fake position should be a new type of position. They must use a farsighted attitude to absorb the new knowledge of advanced countries and use it as much as possible in the country. At the same time, they must continue to work hard to catch up.</p>
<p>At present, labor-management disputes in Shanghai are occurring several times a day, and strikes are everywhere. At a time when Chinese industry is awakening and starting to move forward, in addition to various other issues, if labor issues cannot be resolved, then it will have a great impact on the future of the industrial sector. For the sake of survival in the future, labor and management should understand each other and coordinate with each other. Management must not exploit labor, and labor must not coerce management. Both sides should understand that they are interdependent and cannot be in an adversarial position. If there is no background, they may as well have a calm and rational dialogue. If there is a background, then do not be used by others.</p>
<p>Living Standards Should Match the Environment</p>
<p>Finally, we must talk about the issue of imported goods. This issue is indeed the most serious issue facing the industrial sector at present. Because foreign factories have new equipment and many talents, new inventions emerge one after another, and they are changing with each passing day. Moreover, because they produce in large quantities, their costs are reduced, and when they are sold in China, the price is even lower than that of domestic goods. In this situation, even if the Chinese industrial sector uses all its strength, it will not be able to compete. The only hope is that the general public should understand the situation of their own country. Because the target of the industrial sector's production is the general public, if the general public abandons the products of Chinese factories, then the Chinese industrial sector might as well be completely destroyed. But after the destruction, it is still the Chinese public who will suffer the consequences. Therefore, the general public must really take a long-term view. At this moment, they cannot simply seek enjoyment in life. They must take into account the situation of the Chinese industrial sector everywhere and try their best to support the Chinese industrial sector and use the products of the Chinese industrial sector. Then, the Chinese industrial sector can grow and prosper, and then the people's livelihood will be stable, and naturally they can enjoy a life of peace and prosperity. If they blindly believe in imported goods and raise their living standards higher than those of the United States, then by the time it is appropriate, the national economy will be completely bankrupt, and the general public will not have a stable life to live.</p>
