<h3>三人會義仍在擱淺中　馬帥提整軍折衷案　如不能獲協議談判卽無法繼續　癥結乃在防區制問題</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕馬歇爾於今晨九時許，曾赴主席官邸將周恩來向馬帥所提整軍對案中之具體意見轉陳主席，迄十二時半始離去。午後，周恩來再於三時半起赴馬帥行館，迄七時許始辭出。據關係方面透露：政府對中共所提整軍對案中之三原則，因內容空洞，缺乏誠意，認為越出整軍範圍，不能切合墓前國民之要求，無法討論，軍事三人會議已面臨一前所未經之重要難關。現悉馬帥正草擬一過渡辦法，徵求雙方同意，如無結果，局勢即不容樂觀。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕軍事三人會議已因中共在整軍對案中提出之空洞三原則而吿擱淺。聞馬使曾為此而失眠，然仍以不眠不休之精神，於昨夜草成一過渡式之折衷方案，以期打開此不死不活之僵局。但依據今日個別商談後之種種跡象觀察，此一方案似尙未獲得雙方同意。據有資格之觀察家談。馬使可能就今日與雙方談話之結果，重行修正其昨夜所擬之整軍折衷方案，以便於明晨十時前作最後努力，如此一折衷方案之過渡辦法能獲致協議，將立刻召集軍事三人會，迅速將東北停戰，恢復交通，馬使公斷權，整編·統編·軍令·四問題逐項提出作最後決定。（按前三者均已獲得初步協議，但未簽字。）如馬使所提折衷方案之過渡辦法不能獲致協議，和平談判即無法繼續，停戰限期亦無法再延，故局勢之發展，至為可慮也。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕目前國共整軍談判之　結，乃在防區制之問題。聞主席與馬歇爾晤談時，曾堅決表示必須實行防區制，以舛亂源，而安人心。中共方面則堅決反對防區制，表示如果中共同意退出蘇北各點，則必須有一基本條件，即中共在該區域內原建立之經濟·政治·法律制度，必須保留。此項問題，雙方意見距離甚遠，故田馬帥提出一折衷方案，作為過渡辦法，藉以打破目前之僵局，但此過渡辦法之內容，尙無所悉。傳馬帥明晨將以此項辦法携呈主席商談，如政府及中共均能同意，三人會議即可舉行，和平談判之最後關鍵，將　於明日主席與馬帥之會談。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿八日電〕今晚據悉：馬歇爾將軍之新整軍方案，已於今日向國共雙方提出。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平廿八日電〕察省旅平難民對報戲馬帥提折裏方案，將察省劃爲中共駐軍區，表示拒絕，曾派代表分赴主席行轅，十一戰區長官部，及軍調部請願，並於今日招待記者痛述察民疾苦。</p>
<h3>中共空洞對案　帶來低氣壓　第三方面張申府等　昨與政府代表會談</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕今日下午四時半，　　路八號邵力子公館花園中幽靜之紅磚小洋房內，又展開一席會議。聞此一集會，乃由邵力子，當震，兩氏邀請第三方面人士會談，計到政府方面有張厲生，王世杰，第三方面張甲府，章伯鈞，羅隆基，黃炎培，梁漱滇，陳啓天，張君勱、及莫德惠諸人，至六時三刻始畢。王世杰於未畢會前，忽忽離去。散會後，記者曾叩詢邵氏關於今日會談之內容，邵稱：今日之會，仍在交換意見，對和平談判，盼能於此僅餘之兩日內，作部份解決。邵氏對於和平前途之看法、曾以「有希望」三字為答，唯邵氏接待記者之能）度，過去均極表平靜，但今日之神情則顯示煩悶，京中人士焦　之低氣歷，業　中共整軍對案中之空澗的三原則面俱來。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕據第三方面入士稱：今日在邵氏寓邸談話內容，其重心乃在希望中共能在軍事上有所讓步，政府方面則在政治上有所讓步，並盼於此最後之兩日內，能首先將整軍方案之東北部份予以解決。據聞：此項第三方面意見將由政府代表王世杰於今晚或明晨轉陳蔣主席。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京二十八日電〕中國四萬萬七千萬人之前途，藏於三座不相稱房屋之後，則南京商業區外褐色之磚屋一所，警衛森嚴之軍校高牆內之住宅一所，及有空氣調節設備，房間舒適），庭園寬敞之前億國大使館是也。第一所住宅係周恩來所居，第二所住宅係蔣主席所居，第三所住宅係馬歇爾特使之行館，此三所房屋自本年五月初頭以來，即成為首都活動中心。活動現已進於頂點，因馬使力謀在三十日東北停戰協定終止前，使國共雙方成立協議。馬使今日與蔣主席會義三小時，討論中共最後整軍提案，談話內容雖不詳，但聞馬使利用種種辯解，使國共雙方融和。馬使於今日午餐後，接見周恩來，周氏在馬使行館聽取蔣主席對於中共提案之答復。據中共人士談稱：東北整軍問題已超過每一方駐軍數額問題，此一問題已多少解決，目前根本問題乃在設立每一方之權力範圍，中共贊成分區制度，即中共軍隊控制主要城市一處，政府則控制另一處，蔣主席則堅持中共軍限制及集中於若干商定區域，至少在最近會議以前堅持此見，最後協定即使在停戰限期截止前成立，馬使之任務仍未完畢，政治問題，尙諸端待理。</p>

<h3>「庸劣的戰術」</h3>
<p>英文大美　晚報社論</p>
<p>〔本報特譯〕本市英文大美晚報廿七日發表社論，題爲「庸劣戰術」，對自稱上海人民團體聯合會的發言人陶行知日前對外國記者所發表的談話，加以抨擊，並痛斥共黨的反美運動。</p>
<p>該社論的大意說：「就一個自稱企求和平的人而論，陶行知博士以乎在準備引起麻煩，此外，他似乎還有一種「死人不關」的不負責精神」。</p>
<p>陶博士爲了十位「和平代表」在南京被毆事件，招待新聞記者，聲明此輩不遵從政府意志的人們的舉動，非常無聊！</p>
<p>據我們看來，陶博士承認反美標語是他的一派人的所作所爲之後，已使他的「內戰問題」整個塲面黯然失色。這些標語，已引起不少煽動性的結果，此點可由牽涉美人在內的不愉快事件證明之。</p>
<p>陶博士的藉口是：「美軍一日留在中國，那麼就會產生更多的麻煩。」讓我們講講明白吧：在目前局勢日趨微妙的時候，對於美軍是否應該留駐中國問題，在美人之中（包括軍人官員與平民，）意見並不一致，但是有點事實是很明白的，美軍來華並不是推行帝國主義，而却是打倒日本。關於後一點，他們已經做到，而且把一個民族從束縛中解放出來，但是竟然有人企岡令人忘却這種事實，而轉向含有誘惑性的赤色的一頁走去。</p>
<p>我們是一張美國報紙，是不是免不了懷着徧見呢？毫無疑問，因爲現在受打擊的就是我們，因此，我們可以坦白承認，我們是覺得非常的激憤，所有不以感情用事的人們，必定同意：目前發動反美運動，決非任何負資的中國團體和私人所應爲，美國應該獲到反美運動的報應嗎？美國借款給中國，技術援助中國等等，對於中國人民眞的一些印象也沒有嗎？</p>
<p>我們可以答覆自己的問題：在中國許多人都比陶博士來得穩重，而且有良心。</p>
<p>我們深信：陶博士和他那個組織的同黨，發動反美運動的目的，無非是要引起麻煩，然後加以利用，我們以爲他的戰術，決無所獲，漁翁得利的祗是那些失意份子。」</p>
<h3>社論　不要打，卻更不許拖！</h3>
<p>我們對於今天中國的大局，有一個極簡單的看法，就是：不要打，却更不許拖！打是有痛苦的，而拖的痛苦則更厲害！打是危險的，而拖的危險可使國家民族拖到精疲力盡，萬劫不復！</p>
<p>中國今天的時事，眞使人頭痛腦脹。中國人民，在政府和共黨打打談談，談談打打的糾葛之中，死旣死不得，活又活不了。中國的經濟，勝利以來，爲了時局不安定。交通被破壞，釀成高物價高工資的病態，情况惡劣，瀕於崩潰。中國在抗戰勝利以後，機會空前，本應是中國人民努力建國的黃金時代，而今竟爲了好戰之徒製造內戰，拖了十個月，眼見黃金時代轉瞬消逝，不但機會失而不可復得，抑且國家勢將墜於無可自拔的深淵。這是「打」的過失，却更是「拖」的罪孽！</p>
<p>這個「拖」的責任，中國共產黨固應負其咎，而國民政府尤不能卸其責。中國人民原來對共產黨領敎得很够，固存「與人爲善」之心，但究竟沒有多大的仰望。可是中國人民對於領導抗戰的國民政府，總認爲它應該努力安定大局，領導建國的，而國民政府在法律上在事實上確也責無旁貸，義不容辭。何以政府當局因循敷衍，舉棋不定，忽而打，忽而談，談了又打，打了又談，這樣的一拖再拖，竟拖下十個月之久？十個月了！懷胎的孕婦要分娩了，嬰兒也可呱呱隨地了，而我們則運開誠布公求得一個「和平」還做不到。十個月了！人民的處境，如水益深，如火愈熱，還談什麼「出水火而登袵席」！我們要責備賢者，國民政府在這十個月來應該負擔「拖」字誤國的責任。明天將是停戰延期八天的最後一天了，我們願先提醒政府，並勸吿共黨，要解決，就得在今明兩天以內解決，絕對不許再拖。</p>
<p>說起停戰談判來，也眞令我們够傷心，够痛憤！停戰令一發再發，期限也一展再展，可是延長日期祗剩一天了，談判復談判，三人小組會究竟有了什麼成就？馬帥到昨天還在忙着起草方案，而共黨還是不肯接受。說停戰吧，未必！而且共黨在山西，正加緊圍攻大同；在山東，又襲濰縣；在東北，則林彪招待記者，誇張其發動大野戰的準備。一片殺聲，似乎更將響亮，那裏像停？說恢復交通吧，也只聽樓梯響，不見人下來。兪大維周恩來諸君忙個不了，畢竟那裏已經許可修路隊去修路？津浦路幾時可通？平漢路幾時可走？天曉得，依然紙上談兵，空中樓閣！說整編統編吧，明明白白早已規定好國軍五十師，共軍十師的比例，三方面所，同意的，此時都又要求必須改變，這等於說話簽字都可完全不算，至於防區問題，時而不肯讓出侵佔的省市，時而主張以鄉村爲根據地，時而又要求兵隊統駐城市，總之，千言萬語，不使落到整編縮編的本題上，大家也就摸不着頭腦。這樣談下去，不要說祗剩一天工夫，就是再展延十天百天，甚至無期延期，也還是一個談判不了之局。</p>
<p>老實講：我們希望雙方談，希望雙方誠意的談，必須談出一個結局，辦到和平。可是，我們絕對反對如過去那樣毫無誠意的談法，貌合神離的談法，講斤估兩市儈式的談法；我們尤其不願看見借了「談」作幌子，來掩護「打」的行動。再進一步說：我們誠然渴望和平，但「和」如畢竟可望而不可即，則在「打」與「拖」之中，我們在絕望之餘，不得已而求其次，寗取「打」而絕不要「拖」。這並非我們主張打。相反地，我還們是堅決的說「不要打！」不過不打就得痛痛快快的「和」。如果不打不和，又打又和，長此走上「拖」的路子，則簡直是葬送國家，要老百姓的命了！</p>
<p>和平，和平！人人寤寐以求之，可是「和平」只是我們的目的，我們要有一個和平安定的中國。而怎樣爭取和平，則全看方法。譬如人患毒　惡瘡，遍體俱發。要治好它，只是目的，而如何去治乃是方法。敷藥，服藥，打針，開刀，那樣有效，貴乎因時制宜，決沒有強迫聲生只許敷藥服藥，不許打針開刀之理。今天中國，我們要和平，絕對的要和平。但是談麼？打麼？這都是方法，而「拖」則不是方法，絕對要不得的。可談則談，談好就和；到了不可談，不必談，談而終無效果的時候，我們與其「拖」，還不如忍痛一時聽「打」。因爲打未必死，而拖則必死！服了藥又想開刀，開刀到了中途，却又想敷藥，這樣六神無主，手足無措的下去，病人大槪拖死完結！中國今天的大局，不幸的很像要走上這條絕路，而這條拖的絕路實在是萬萬不能再走了！</p>
<p>於此，我們還得再說明白一點：和與打，我們無條件的百分之百的希望和。可是萬一不能和而剩下了打與拖，我們却又無條件的百分之百的反對再拖。惟其如此，有一綫和平希望的時候，我們人民要求政府和共黨千萬誠意的求取和平；但是到了和平眞己絕望的時候，我們絕不應諱疾忌醫，依然阻止醫生爽快乾脆的開刀。蘇北魯南流亡難民之所以呼喊打回老家去」者，大概也是這種不耐煩心理的表現吧。</p>
<p>最後，時下有一句似是而非的話，說「打是打不出民主來的」，那末難道拖倒可以拖得出民主來嗎？我們以爲：兵凶器，戰危事，仁者用心，止戈爲武，非萬不得已，何必用兵？但是說民主決不能打出來的，却也未必是眞理。美國的南北戰爭，史家也稱之爲「內戰」。林肯總統爲了解放黑奴，引起了道塲「內戰」，打是打了，美國民主的基礎却更鞏固了，常時也沒有聽到「反內戰」的呼聲，而打也何嘗打不出民主來？第一次世界大戰，打敗了成廉第二，創造了蘇維埃聯邦，而蘇聯共產黨也曾與白俄大打「內戰」，畢竟打是打了，也打出世界上一個「新型」的民主國家——蘇聯來了。這次世界大戰，擊潰了法西斯的德·日·義三大寇，民主國家的生存纔解除了威脅，打是打了，而未來德·日·義三國的民主政制也將由此孕育起來了。從這些例子，都可以證明打也許有時可以打出民主來的，而拖則決無此望。故我們第一希望和能够不打，總是千萬不要打。但不打不和而只拖，終陷國家民族於危亡之境，那眞是千秋萬世的罪人！</p>

<h3>四國外長盡最大努力　通盤討論和約草案　清除障礙俾和會能如期召集　目前癓結仍在特港主權問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿八日廣播：四強外長會議因特港問題而陷於僵局，今日四外長開會時，曾就義大利及巴爾幹國家簽約問題作最大努力，企圖打破僵局，但結果未詳。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿八日電〕四國外長今日繼續會議，作最後一分鐘之努力，通盤討論對義·保·羅·匈·芬五國和約，以便清除荊棘，使廿一國和平會議，得於七月間在巴黎舉行。四外長昨日已解決杜特坎尼斯羣島及法義邊界問題，頗感振奮，各塲次長提出對五國和約之草案，於今日會議中討論。衆認特港問題仍為解決各項縣案之關鍵所在。縣案中頗多基本問題，如賠款·殖民地·剩餘軍艦之分派等問題均是。對巴爾幹各國和約之主要問題，乃與多瑙河航行自由及對各該國通商自由有關。對芬和約，並無根本之意見分歧。據英方人士意，四外長昨日會議雖有豐富收穫，然彼等自定今日爲完成對五國和約工作之期限，能否如願，尚有疑問。且和會能否於七月十五日召開，亦殊可疑。</p>

<p>按杜特坎尼斯羣島共有十三小島，原屬土耳其，係於一九一一年由義大利佔領，人口共四萬，多屬希臘漁民。戰時蘇聯曾要求在該島建立海空軍基地。</p>

<p>那一天，正是斯退丁紐斯向杜魯門總統提出辭職的一天，也是總統「遏止罷工法案」在議會慘遭敗北的後兩天。斯退丁紐斯不願出任美國駐安全理事會的全權代表，理由是與杜魯門貝爾納斯的政見不合，不合的焦點雖未明說，但隱隱約約也有一點蛛絲馬跡可尋。在斯退丁紐斯辭職消息公布前一星期，紐約　壇報的記者說，聯合國安理會對於伊朗案件的討論，意見頗不一致，他又說：「斯退丁紐斯先生，認為伊朗案件，發展到這一個局面，似乎可以允許蘇聯的請求，在議事程序上撤銷」。但那位記者在最後一段上說：「美國的態度，是要繼續討論下去的，除非蘇聯對伊內政的壓力，完全解除」。斯退丁紐斯旣是美國的全權代表，然與美國政府的外交决策，意見各殊。果然，四五天之後，就發表了斯氏辭職的消息。我以為：斯退丁紐斯辭職，僅不過美國民主黨外交，走入歧途口的象徵而已。常今美國的人才，汗牛充棟，要找一個代替的人，坐在安理會上唱唱「留聲機」，並不是一件了不起的大事，問題的重心，却在今後這一個外交緊張的關鍵，民主黨應該如何掌握它？</p>
<p>慕尼黑第二</p>
<p>具爾納斯國務卿，到巴黎去開了一次四强外長會議，匆匆的回來了，同去的兩位外交健將，范登堡和康納利，這次和貝爾納斯，都有了空前的合作，回來後，對貝爾納斯的堅毅果斷，讚不絕口，范登堡在巴黎的某一天晚上，和紐約論壇報的記者，通了一次長途電話，論壞報原本　　和黨有歷史淵源，對於共和黨中第一流的大健將，常然是記載唯恐不詳。電話的一問一答，每一句，每一個字，都記錄了下來。那篇長途電話的訪問記，最中心的意思，是范登堡先生，在巴黎看見了當年的所謂「慕尼黑」，他說：這是眞正的又一個「慕尼黑」，沒有什麽可以再開會討論的了。他說：開會本來是相互對論的，但在巴黎，除非美國步步遷就蘇聯，才有結果，「莫洛託夫的意見，就是聖經，我們是無權修改的」？</p>
<p>但是，范登堡，在電話裏笑了起來，「慕尼黑時代，還有一個拿著洋傘僕僕風塵的張伯倫先生，除今，可沒有那樣的好人了。」他吿訴論壇報的記者：「我馬上回華盛頓，再也沒有什麽討論的了！」事實上，范登堡，康納利和貝爾納斯回華盛頓的日子，較電話中預定的，遲了五天，巴黎會議上，雖然沒有張伯倫，但，貝爾納斯他們，渴求諒解的心理，是和張伯倫一樣的。</p>
<p>第三次大戰　無法避免？</p>
<p>巴黎會議是戰後民主黨外交的一個轉捩點，巴黎會議慘酷無情的失敗，使杜魯門政府的決策，不能不作慕尼黑以後第二步的打算。范登堡的電話裏，沒有講到「戰爭」一個字，論壇報的記者問他：「如果會議無結果，如果以後世界的局面更惡劣，該怎麽辦？」范登堡祗笑著說：「我不知道。」但貝爾納斯飛同華盛頓以後的廣播，却說得非常明顯了，他說：倘若蘇聯沒有存心求和平，則第三次世界大戰，殆已無法避免。」一個領導國家的外交部長，說出這樣嚴重的公開文獻，我們不能以平常的眼光，衡斷他的份量！在這樣一個大轉捩的決策之下，我不敢說，美國一定會立刻步入戰爭，但在這兩年杜魯門政府的期限之中，美國的一點滴，都會向這一個大原則走的。軍事根據地的大規模擴展，冰島，大西洋島嶼，裏海，美國的基地談判，在許多國家同時展開著。英國的五十萬萬大借款通過了，交換條件，是美國自由使用太平洋上的英國根據地。法國的十二萬萬五千萬大借款也通過了，七十多歲的老頭子萊翁勃侖，拚著老命奔來美國，借款成功了，萊翁勃侖也飛回法國去了。可能的結果，是法國社會黨的力量，會大大伸展，從前模稜兩可的法國態度，也逐步在澄淸了。古盎安內閣表示法美關係將更加友善，在安理會中，瘦長臉的法國代表，從前專門跟美國碰釘子，也常常嘲笑中國代表的傢伙，以後會乖乖的替美國舉手了。金元外交是現實中最現實的手段之一，但無論如何，在今日世界上是有著他的權威的。</p>
<p>「金元外交」　與對蘇貸款</p>
<p>李希海軍上將，現係總統的軍事顧問，也忽然坐著飛機到了英國，任務沒有宣佈，紐約一張報紙上說：李希的任務，是佈置英美的軍事聯防。莫斯科電台發覺了，這幾天，正拚命廣播，攻擊美國的基地政策。然而蘇聯人並沒有了解基地政策，是要靠「金元外交」來撑腰的，難這莫斯科的宣傳家，不能更深一層地批評一下「金元外交」嗎！</p>
<p>間題的重點在這裏：在莫斯科提出的大借款，沒有百分之百地絕望以前，蘇聯還是願意寫一個短時期的緘默。我沒有詳細探聽過借款的詳細本末，但知道，已經通過了的借款，有比利時，法國和英國，沒有通過的是中國，波蘭和蘇聯。中國的借款，由國會授權給馬歇爾將軍了，問題比較簡單，波蘭的借款一度交換過意見，認為在目前波蘭的現狀之下，是要法商談借款的。議員們說：「我們的要求很簡單，最低限度，要能使波蘭的新聞自由完全開放了，才可以談判借款。」波蘭的新聞自由，要向別一個國家去請示的，因之，案件就被擱置了下來。好像還沒有討論過蘇聯的借款，案件還根本沒提到國會。我在華盛頓的時候，在國會休息室裏聽記者們和議員們聊天。有位議員說了一番話，我認為非常深入而淺出。他翹着手指說：「美國人現在不放心蘇聯，蘇聯也不信任美國。要蘇聯相信美國不容易，但要美國信任蘇聯，只要做到三件事就成：第一，要準許美國新聞記者們，可以從蘇聯任何地方報導新聞出來，即所謂新聞交換的自由。第二，兩國互相派遣軍事參謀團，互相監督不作挑動戰爭的準備。第三，兩國必須交換留學生。可惜的是：現在這三件事都無法做到，全世界任何國家，都有留學生在美國，唯獨蘇聯闕如。（未完）</p>
<h3>聯珠式運用否決權　蘇代表無理取鬧　安理會條例殊有修正必要　伊西問題擬提交大會討論</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約廿七日電〕聯合國安理會會員多人頃宣稱，目前鑒於蘇聯之利用否決權，以反對最多數決議，安全理事會之否決權條例殊有加以修正之必要。如昨夜討論西班牙弗朗哥問題歷六小時，蘇聯代表葛洛米哥竟兩次使用否決權，推翻多數之決議，若不予以修改，則各國委託理事會處理國際和平與安全問題時，將失却其信仰。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿七日電〕蘇代表葛羅米柯昨在安理會聯珠式運用其否決權，澳代表伊代特曾斥為一種「譭謗」行動。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿八日電〕自蘇聯代表葛羅米柯在安理會討論西班牙問題時，提出三次否決辦法後，聞英美現正計劃將複雜之西班牙及伊朗問題，自安理會中提出，交由九月召開之聯合國大會討論。蓋聯合國大會並無大國之否決權，惟根據安理會程序規則，上述二案得由七國之程序表決，予以撤消。故將該二案自安理會議程中移去之技術，將成為極重要之問題。同時據悉，澳代表伊伐特將於九月之大會中繼續力爭取消五強否決權，至少亦須將否決權予以限制。</p>
<h3>原子能委會</h3>
<p>商討規程問題　拒絕記者旁聽</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿八日電〕聯合國原子能委會蘇聯代表，今日通知該委會謂，通過任何議案必須經三分之二之代表投票贊成。原子能委會今日舉行第一次執委會議，開始討論管理原子能之永久辦法。惟現因蘇聯代表之通知，將於會議時，對投票問題光予討論。聯合國安理會規程專家昨日曾通過一項規定，任何措置一經委會十二代表中多數通過即可施行，蘇聯規程專家認為不然，聲明保留，亦於今日向委員會提出此一問題之權。今日會議因大部份係有關規程問題，故不允新聞記者等旁聽。</p>
<h3>蘇聯責美　把持原子秘密</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿七日電〕蘇聯電合評論員奧西博夫，今日在莫斯科廣播，重行聲明蘇聯反對美代表巴魯克所提之原子能管理計劃，並謂美國欲鞏固其原子能專利權，以稱覇世界。　奧氏宣稱，撇　蘇聯而能决定國際問題之時代已成過去，頑固派因盲目的憎恨民主而失去其一切，理應謹記此項敎訓。蘇聯之原子能管理方案，係由堅定不移的爭取國際和平與親善而產生者。</p>
<h3>第四顆原子彈　投擲期迫近　白鼠山羊權充試驗品　白朗第推測炸後結果</h3>
<p>〔聯合社原子彈試騐記者船阿派拉欽號廿七日電〕美陸海軍之原子彈試騐準備，截至目前為止，對於新聞報道方面，可謂已歸失敗。除非電訊交通能於今數日內大加改善，各記者咸恐世界第四枚原子炸彈之爆炸，將等於無綫電單獨表現，報紙不能及時刊載。阿派拉欽號船上各記者，無人能充分說明電訊阻滯之原因。據電訊交通管理員稱，本船各種信號，發出甚為强大，但珍珠港與舊金山方面不能適當收聽。初步試騐迄未獲得任何照片，比基尼珊瑚礁之攝影員已受安全會條例之限制。同時廣大之無綫電節目亦已預備，以便報吿轟炸情形。新聞船與本土接觸困難，故星期一初步演習之消息，於六小時後，始行到達美國。美國各科學家以為倘因氣候惡劣，將第一次原子彈試騐延至八月間第三星期舉行，則今年不致舉行試騐，因</p>
<p>颱風季將臨</p>
<p>矣，至於原子彈之爆炸是否將引起颱風，此問題尙不能解答，但可靠之氣象家均不以為然。即使有颱風發作，亦不致危及原子試騐船隻及人員，因颱風初起時，並不猛烈。此種颱風且亦不致危及美國海岸，因風勢向菲律濱方面移動不變，旋即轉北，消散於阿留申方面。同時各靶子艦已分別停泊於指定地點，內有美海軍戰艦「阿剛薩斯」號，「紐約」號，「尼伐達」號及本雪凡尼亞」號，重巡艦「本薩古拉」號及「鹽湖城」號，航母「薩拉多加」號，輕航母「獨立」號等。日戰艦「長門」號，日輕巡艦「佐川」號及德重巡艦「歐琴親王」號，亦在其列。其餘之靶子艦為登陸艇及運輸艇。第一枚原子炸彈之靶子中心點為「尼伐達」號，該艦排水量二萬九千噸，漆成淡橘色，上置</p>
<p>白鼠三百頭</p>
<p>一部份山羊將　在靶子艦上各曝露處，另有一部份分別隔離。一部份山羊將蔽以種種布疋，亦置於曝露處，迫近靶子中心點者將敷以各種反光膏，以資保護。各種軍事材料及糊食，自四十六噸重之戰車及兩噸重之炸彈，以至罐裝豌豆，自各式彈藥以至火汕煤斤，將依軍略方式曝露於靶子艦上，以測騐火燄熱力，震盪及無綫電動力對無生物與彈藥之效力。除測騐核心爆炸對軍艦之效力外，此項試騐另有其他各項目標：（一）測騐對於飛機之效力。（二）進一步獲悉對於人類之效力。（三）獲悉原子彈對於兵艦與其他目標之比較價値。（四）獲悉原子爆炸同時發生現象之一般科學價値。指責此項試騐者佔計，此次試騐將耗去五億元以上，但據海軍負責人裘里哈中尉稱：</p>
<p>全部試驗費</p>
<p>不致超過一億一千萬元。據原子試騐司令白朗第稱：不知艦船及靶子將發生何項實際結果，但相信不致引起下列諸事：（一）不致炸死海中魚類之半數，惟將殺死礁湖之魚類。（二）不致引起地震或產生新山脈，亦不致引起海嘯。（三）不致在水中發生連爆性反應，使全部化為毒氣，而使海洋各處所有船隻沉入海底。（四）不致破壞地心吸力。至本月卅日拂曉時，比基尼島將無人跡，其所留唯一生物，為靶子船上之白鼠與山羊而已。</p>

<h3>日關軍不受節制　發動九一八事變　若槻出席國際法庭作證　宇垣供述相任內政情</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京廿八日專電〕九一八事變時任日首相之若槻禮次郞今晨向國際戰罪法庭作證稱：關東軍完全不受節制，其佔領東北係違反內閣之願望，內閣雖力謀由當時有力之二政黨組織聯合內閣，俾將陸軍置於管制之下，加以壓力，渠之內閣在九一八事變發生後一日，即一九三一年九月十九日始獲悉該項事變，旋即被迫辭職云。</p>
<p>若槻訊問畢，即傳喚過去日政界「惑星」宇垣一成大將出庭作證，庭上頓形緊張，檢察官海倫宜讀其口供錄稱：「一九二四年余任陸相，命令縮小陸軍成功。濱口內閣之陸相時代一九三一年一月或二月間，憲兵隊將校報吿謂大川周明博士計劃於議會作某種示威行動。同年三月底大川來書勸余就任昭和維新運動首領。其後參謀本部甚多將校報吿此事，乃與小磯軍務局長及杉山次官商談，兩人報吿謂大川等陰謀傾覆政府，並預定余為革命政府首揆。余即命小磯杉山立即中止使用陸軍實行革命之一切計畫該陰謀即三月事件，余隨濱口內閣於一九三一年四月十三日辭職，並自動退出陸軍。一九二八年廣田內閣瓦解後，余曾受組閣命令，因余任陸相時縮小軍備，拒絕協助黷武派三月事件，常時陸軍三長官所薦候補陸軍大臣三人拒絕就任，因此組閣未成」。</p>
<h3>犬養毅子　供詞矛盾</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿八日電〕日前首相犬養毅子犬養健今日在遠東國際軍事法庭繼續作證，惟關於日皇裕仁在「滿洲事變」中之地位仍未能十分明瞭，犬養健昨日之供詞一方面謂日皇愛好和平，一方面又謂其拒絕下詔撤回滿洲日軍，首席法官魏勃指為自相矛盾，不願再聆其言，惟有一部份法官欲令犬養健就此點再加說明。今日據其繼續供稱：犬養毅實際曾否請日皇下詔，或僅向宮內大臣接洽，未能確知，但信其確有令日皇結束滿洲事變之意。</p>

<h3>十萬擔川米運抵滬　七千餘包啟封配售</h3>
<p>宋院長電令徐部長夤夜來滬</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕連日米市又起劇烈波動，當局正力謀抑制中。除嚴誡糧商不得有囤匿或黑市買賣等非法行爲外，一面書量設法增加米糧來源。日昨市府派員與警備司令部商妥，將糧貸舞弊案中三泰米行長江公司及在協大亨萬順福兩米行被封存之米糧七千餘包，飭令稽查處啓封後，交由社會局公開配售，所得價款一律解繳中央銀行國庫。至於詳細配售辦法及規定價格，均由社會局擬具後，呈田吳市長决定。又據社會局消息：該批食米之售價，規定每石爲三萬八至四萬六千元云。</p>

<h3>醒醒吧　做著黃金夢的人！</h3>
<p>暴漲暴落混「油水」的時代過去了</p>
<p>明知道黃金是飢不能餐，寒不能衣，上海人却偏多的是黃金迷。與其說八年的抗戰帶來了急遽的通貨膨脹，透澈地說，該是加深了上海人拜金主義的瘋狂程度！</p>
<p>話其不信，請看今日的上海灘，張三李四，伸出手來，總少不了有個金戒十。爲了迎合一般市民對金飾的愛好，新興銀樓正像雨後春筍般蓬勃着。談房地產汽車等等買賣，討價還價，是幾根或是幾條，這是交易市塲中的口頭禪。</p>
<p>記者是執筆的醫文者，對黃金的一切，素來是寡聞鮮見，這一來却引起了訪問金舖的興趣。記者選了好幾家具有數十年歷史的金舖，跟幾位年已六十開外的店主東，做了一番瑣碎的長談。</p>
<p>一扯開話盒子，他們都本能憧憬到逝去了的青年時代，民國八九年時上海的黃金，不過是十八九元一兩。而那時用的還是　秤，以十六兩爲一斤。改爲市秤後，一斤只有以前的十三兩六錢四</p>
<p>現在市面上所通稱的烚赤，顧名思義，應該是足赤的。可是這句話，只能相對的講。因爲在上海就沒有這樣的設備及火功，可提煉到這樣的純凈程度。據說：最高只能提煉到九九四五。可是這句話，也只能在二十年前這樣說，因爲現在流通的烚赤，成色是九九三。</p>
<p>條子的來源</p>
<p>談到本市黃金的來源，在國內通常是以東九省地帶的砂金條子，很負盛名。但其成色却因地段而有不同，大致有八九八八至八一八八不等。錦州地方產金，成色較高，大致是九七或九八不等。他如山東招遠牟平兩地，也有小量產金運來。成色就較差了，最低的只二三成，高的七八成也有。</p>
<p>說起市塲上流通的金條來，大致有毛條和光條二種。毛條都是本市各金舖熔鑄的。每條長約五吋，闊約一寸，厚約二分餘。一面有熔鑄金舖的陰文牌號。這批金條，表面都凹凸不平，面貌顯得很醜陋，於是得了「毛條」的雅號，可是成色却都是九九三。另一批是敵人收買紗布所發出來的「光條」，表面是光滑平正，也沒有鐫刻牌號，成色在九九一至九九二之間。據說：最近中央銀行分批自國外運來的金條，大多是四百昻士（英兩）一條，成色都近九九九，與足赤差一絲而已，所以委託各金鋪熔鑄時，成色方面，還得冲淡一下。</p>
<p>談到這裏，記者就實地參觀了一所金條的熔鑄工塲。主要的設備，不過是一個陳舊的炭電頭。中間燃着一小堆熊熊的炭火。熔金的盛器，是一個直徑約摸半呎的瓦罐。熔時要先試騐它的耐熱性。一小罐就可熔金二百餘兩。熔解後，用鐵火鉗夾着像醬油碟大小的陶盆，往熔金罐裏陶滿了一小盆，剛够注滿鐵製的金條模型槽裏。在槽裏冷却的過程中，還要用吹管不時的吹。冷凝後，糟子裏傾倒出來的，不正是瘋狂了上海交易市塲上的金條。可是它誕生的過程，又是那末的醜陋！</p>
<p>石上顯原形</p>
<p>新聞辭令裏用慣了的「試金石」，終於也在金舖裏見到了。它是一塊扁薄橢圓形的石頭，顏色黑黝黝的。據說：此物產量極少，大多來自四川，石質要擇其輕而嫩，容易磨上金子，而且易於顯色。試騐金子成色時，只要把金子往試金石上磨上十來下，黑色的石底上，就襯托出一道道鮮艷的金色。然後再把這金色跟小塊的金對牌細細核對。這種金對牌，共分淨混兩串，淨的有六七十塊，混的有一百廿餘塊，每塊代表一種成色。在磨金人精銳眼光核對之下，任何金子的好醜，無不原形畢露。可是一個磨金人要訓練到爐火純靑的地步，非十年廿年莫辦！</p>
<p>據說：黃金近來的活躍，銀樓實銷鼎盛，是一個主因。這正說明了新興銀樓蓬勃的理由了！南京路一家新銀樓，不惜以九十條的驚人代價，來頂門面。老西門的某銀樓，也化了七十多條的代價頂門面。難道開張後眞能「　得翻倒」麼？金業領袖們的解答是够凄慘的。他們說：現在大同行每天實銷約百兩左右，中小型的約四五十兩。每兩的毛利，是萬把塊錢。可是須除去師父，做手，夥計等拆賬三千五百元，營業所得稅千分之十五，以每兩廿萬元計，就是三千元。賸下來的還要支付一應開支等，利潤怎樣，不言可喻。所以目前許多新開銀樓中，不少在喊救命的。到了今年底，怕還有即景可看！</p>
<p>黃金的幻夢</p>
<p>上海人對黃金的估價，一向是高的。隨着投機市塲的逐步收縮，他們又憧憬到黃金市塲前途的幻夢。人人都那末想着：總有一天，黃金要猛竄一下。可是出現在金業領袖們口中的話，却正與上海人的幻想相反。他們說：上海人吞金的胃口，好比吞砒霜，不分靑紅皂白的往下吞。單餘中央銀行最近三個月來拋售黃金的數字講，已達卅餘萬兩。收回通貨，已近六百億元。可是中央銀行還是不斷的拋售。</p>
<p>據估計：上海的存金量，在八一三事變前，已相當可觀。敵偽時期，敵人也先後帶來了一批黃金。至敵人投降時止，偽中央儲備銀行的庫房裏，據說還存有黃金四十萬兩。現在散處在上海人手裏的存金，估計也在百萬兩以上。至於中央銀行的庫房裏，現成的黃金，至少在「數」百萬兩以上。這個「數」字的大小，讓讀者自己去下斷語。不過値得注意的是，中央銀行還在美國源源運金而來，就已拋售的卅餘萬兩而言，不過是滄海一粟而已。</p>
<p>醒醒吧，做着黃金夢的上海人，暴漲暴落混「油水」的時代，已成過去。不過，公債市塲總崩潰的創痛猶新，希望黃金潮不再是個覆轍！（蒼龍　）</p>

<p>〔又訊〕本市戲劇業公會，廿六日晨推派代表，分謁吳市長等，要求：（一）延遲營業時間至晚十二時，（二）取銷票價限價，（三）减少百分之二十保衛附加捐，以第三項减捐請求未獲結果，乃於前日召開全體會員大會，決定於七月一日起全體停業。昨晨市府舉行之市政會義中，對該案曾提出討論，決定對戲劇業公會之要求：（一）准許延長營業時間至十二時，（二）除三分之一座位售最低票價外，餘准放寬票價，（三）娛樂捐仍持原議，徵百分之五十。會後並即由社會局吳局長轉知戲劇業公會理事長周劍星，請分別通知該公會各會員云。</p>
<h3>一波未平　一波又起　許士滙許佩璜父子　攻擊法院被控誹謗</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海地方法院檢察處全檢察官匋，近日起訴一侮　法院之案件，微有聖芳濟中學學生許佩璜，因騎脚踏軍行經中正東路江西路時，碰撞沈姓老者致死，經地院刑庭判處徒刑四月，緩刑二年。而許不服，不由上訴之法定程序，而於本年五月十九日新聞報「讀者之聲」欄內，爲文謂地院玩法判刑，並稱：「他們與家父談判，囑以廿五根金條了結，並可代爲上訴，宣判無罪，不知他們有何通天本領，把莊嚴之國法玩弄，我立誓在此，以上事實如有虛言，甘願受大眾裁判……。」全檢察官閱報，即行追查，許佩璜竟說不知是誰要金條，而其父許士滙，則謂係對造之趙姓親眷，其要金條之目的在民事賠償和解云云。經偵訊後，法院方面認爲一十五歲之少年，竟愍不畏法，胡亂攻擊，其父不無敎唆之處，乃以共犯刑法第二十八條第二十九條第一項第二項及第三百十條第二項加重誹謗之罪嫌，由全檢察官依法提起公訴。</p>

<h3>軍事法庭提審義人巴達底尼　供受墨索里尼命令　國際公法是否觸犯頗堪研究</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前上海義大利海軍陸戰隊指揮官巴達底尼昨由軍事法庭唐鳴時法官開庭提審。首提被吿供稱：當時義僑自集中營受釋及協助日軍在江南造船廠工作等事，均係奉墨索里尼政府之命令，彼曾赴東京與義國代表商議後返滬，僅負管理僑民之職。在江南造船廠工作之義僑約二百餘人，其中頗多爲謀解決生活問題而自動應徵參加者。庭上繼傳當時任聯絡及醫官之鮑佛利等四義人上庭作證，據稱：因日方對工作者有米麵配給，故確有多人爲生活問題而自動應徵，所做工作，亦僅爲搬運等苦力工作。至此庭諭改期再審。據唐法官語記者：此案雖並不嚴重，然爲一頗饒興趣之國際法上之問題，因當時義大利有兩政府，一爲義王主持，一爲墨索里尼主持，被吿　奉後者命令，是否觸犯國際公法，頗堪研究云。</p>

<h3>特稿　跛足的青年數學家　華羅庚談蘇聯觀感</h3>
<p>本報昆明十八日航訊　特派員張生力</p>
<p>談到清華大學的敎授，一般人常注意到兩個較爲特殊的人物，—一是獨足的　光旦，一是跛足的華羅庚；一個研究優生，一個專攻數學；一個當談民主，一個不問政治；一老一少，各有千秋。潘敎授成名甚久，茲姑略而不論。而華羅庚三字，在最近數年中。始爲少數人所注意。老牌敎授說：「他是後起之秀」。社會上一般人說：「他也是敎授」？去冬，陳辭　部長請他到重慶，爲了一張飛機票，他陂听謂「起碼的要人」，擠下了三次，最近，他田蘇聯載譽歸來後，雖只穿上一身極普通的西服，許多人忽然把他靑作學術上的要人，使他忙於講演，會客，竟有人伸出大姆指說：「我們中國」，或者說：〔我們聯大」，「也有這位了不起的人物」！</p>
<p>關於十華羅庚的生平，報紙上曾有片段的記載。華氏生於江蘇　壇，現年三十七歲。幼時家小康，乃父經營棉花店，因年邁力衰，每况愈下。華氏在金壇初中肄業時，數學成績常是五十分，但其師王維克，發現他有數學天才，故常予以鼓勵與帮助。十五歲畢業後，找不到職業，也無法升學，遂在家担任小掌櫃，歷時五年餘。其後因獲王維克先生之援引，出任金壇初中庶務會計，兼敎課一班。但被人攻擊爲不合格敎員，旋即辭去。二十一歲時，同鄉康佩金先生，（現任中大敎務長），介紹他到淸華，任算學系助理，四年內，連升三級，他的職位，已由助理而至研究員。他的數學天才，至此始獲發展與表現的機會。在校任研究員三年，被派至英國劍橋火學深造，越二年返國。二十八年來昆。任淸華敎授，執敎於聯人。</p>
<p>華氏在數學上的成就，固由於其、天才與努力，而其夫人亦曾予以較大的帮助。二十歲結婚，現有三男一女。據華氏云：〔我是初中畢業，她是小學畢業，眞可算是門當戶對」。結婚的那年，金壇流行傷寒症，縣城居民死於此疫者極多，華氏亦染此病，經中西醫治療後，轉成關節炎，雖幸免於死，而其左腿即因此而跛。華氏此次訪蘇，蘇醫學界人士，認爲治癒其腿，是一件極簡單的事，只需四個月即可，華氏因爲特問所限，故未就醫。有一次，他到一個醫學研究所打防疫針，醫生又談到他的腿，華氏問要多少錢，醫生很奇怪的說：「這要錢嗎？」華氏反問曰：「這不要錢嗎？」彼此相視而笑。</p>
<p>華氏此次訪蘇，係受其著作之賜。一九四一年華氏將其歷年著作，整編爲「堆壘素數論」，送請蘇聯科學院出版，但因德蘇戰爭而擱置。歐戰勝利後，科學院即將該書譯成俄文，蘇數學家認爲該　　稱數學佳作之一，　視華氏的成就，已達世界第一流標準。故由科學院聘請華氏赴蘇。他於二月二十五日離昆，取道印度，伊拉克，伊朗，赴莫斯科，五月二十五日循原道返抵昆明，歷時共三月。在蘇五十餘天，曾在莫斯科，列甯格勒，巴庫特比利西等地參觀講演，但因俄語根底較差，故常需借助於翻譯。返昆後，他在公私塲合中，不談蘇聯政治，也不提及原子彈，一些好奇的訪問者，多因此而失望。</p>
<p>關於訪蘇觀感，華氏會就蘇聯的科學與高等敎育，作過幾次簡略的公開講演，據談：在蘇聯的新五年計劃中，最重要的目標有二：（一）使生產恢復到戰前的百分之一百四十；（二）注重科學的發展。蘇聯在一九四四年時，敎育文化科學方面的經費預算，是五一四萬萬盧布，其中敎育費二一一萬萬，公共衛生費一〇四萬萬，科學研究費十三萬萬，培植專家的費用四十四萬萬，這此數字，並不包括全部研究機關，例如全蘇科學院，各種人民委員會研究所，學校研究所，人民團體研究所，其經費另有預算，由此可見其科學費用的龐大。全蘇科學院分八例部門，七十六個研究所，一九四〇年有工作人員五千人，一九四二年增至七千人，另有許多實騐室，天文台，測量站。科學院的組織，最高行政機　是由一百一十八個研究員組成的，此外有一百八十個通訊員，和五個榮譽研究員，史達林即其中之一。全蘇科學院，即是掌握在這些研究員的手中。當有研究員出缺時，首由各研究所及社團推薦候選人，次由科學院組織委員會審查資格，然後提交該院火會通過，獲得三分之二的票數始可當選。故在蘇當研究員是極困難與極光榮的，研究員和敎授的待遇均較優，一個普通大學敎授，月薪一萬二千盧布，約合美金一千元。若以美國而論，愛因斯坦的全年薪俸，只有一萬到一萬二千美金，還不及蘇聯一個普通敎授，至於研究員，月薪爲二萬二千盧布。政府另設有科學家商店，出售廉價物品，除科學家外，他人不能進去購物。在精神方面，有兩種金質獎章，一爲勞動英雄章，一爲史達林獎章，全蘇科學獲此獎章者僅十五人，其中有兩位數學家。</p>
<p>華氏談到其他小共和國的科學研究，舉出了兩個較特殊的例子：（一）亞塞爾拜然共和國，僅有人口一百萬，主政的四個部長，年齡均在三十八歲以下，其科學家的中心工作，爲研究提煉石油及地質調查，他們在這方面的貢獻極大；（二）喬治亞共和國，是史達林的故鄉，首都特比利亞，是數學的天地，敎育部長，大學校長，科學院長，都是全蘇知名的數學家，喬治亞大學學生二千人，學數學的有六百人，莫斯科大學有敎授百餘位，其中五十二人是敎數學的，由此可見蘇聯的重視數學。華氏素極景仰的大數學家潘楚雅琴，五歲時就瞎了眼睛，他在莫斯枓大學首次遇見這位敎授時，感到非常奇怪，他覺得這在別的國家，實不易作到。</p>
<p>關於蘇聯的大學敎育，華氏曾在雲南大學講演過。據談：蘇聯的大學只分系，不分院，系數較少的大學裏，有一個指導員（等於校長），兩個副指導員（即副校長）。系數較多的大學，各系有一個指導員，學校的行政事務，即由這些人共同負責。工業專科學校，大都有六系。農業研究所，普通只有二至三系。凡能稱爲大學的，至少須有七系，如莫斯科大學即有十一系。大學裘除系之外，尙有許多講座，講授特殊科目，莫斯科大學，有一百二十幾種學科設有講座。談到高等敎育機關的數目，現在全蘇共有七百六十二所高等學校，一百二十八所工業高等專門學校，二十三所藝術短期學校，八十七所醫藥高等專門學校，二十九所大學，一百一十二所師範學校，六十九所農藝高等學校。大學生五十六萬人，敎授四萬人，戰後因爲校舍缺乏，許多學校還是輪班上課。莫斯科及列甯格勒的大學，學生每期交學費四百盧布，但可向學校領得許多獎學金，每月約可獲二百到三百盧布，足供一月之用，各項獎學金，佔全校預算的三分之一，這是他國沒有的·中小學各五年，完全免費，十年後升入大學。大學六年，畢業生的工作，早已訂在國家五年計劃之內，對於某種學科有特別心得者，可繼續入研究院，每月發給研究費七百五十盧布，前兩年研究特殊科目，第三年做論文。畢業後又可進博士研究院，每月研究費一千五百盧布，研究一年，論文及格，得博士學位。</p>
<p>談到蘇聯的一般情况，華氏云：戰時物價漲了百分之五十，戰後物價已跌了百分之四十，糧食不成問題，衣着比較英美差，一般人的臉孔雖很瘦，但未見到叫化子。各地復員建設工作，正在積極的進行，他們似乎沒有不復員的情事。他說：「蘇聯這個國家，不管你喜歡她或討厭她，都是値得我們了解的」。這位苦幹成功的靑年數學家，此次訪蘇歸來後，頗有感觸於衷，他熱望我們的國家，也應該一致的幹起來。（六月十八日）</p>

<h3>撥配制照常實施中　米號竟無貨應市</h3>
<p>主管當局正籌劃澈底穩定辦法　吳市長召米業負責人垂詢情形</p>
<p>本市民食趨勢，日來又漸趨嚴重，米號無貨應市，刺激人心不少，惟米市塲仍將每日登記客米照市撥配各該登記米號，無如粥少僧多，因此疏通米源，充裕存底，殊爲常前要務，蓋自米號採取撥配制後，一般米客將運滬米糧拒不向市塲登記，私自在外交易，以致發生黑市交易，同時米商則以已無重利可圖，故採購乏勁，現本市主管當局正在星夜籌劃，謀澈底穩定本市民食，僉以米糧來滬稀少，存底不充，固為促使米市不穩狀態之一因，然間有若干米　，從中作祟，企岡抬價漁利，以致人心忐忑，亦屬主要原因，今當局對此種情事，將次第設法解除，如有人非法囤積食米，或米號隱匿不售，任人檢舉，以憑究辦，市社會局，警察局均已派員密查，吳市長幷在市府召見米號案公會負責人，垂詢米市情形，幷有重要指示。</p>
<p>各路來源絡繹　客貨登記增加</p>
<p>米糧來源增加，昨日米市塲客貨登記總達四千二百八十二石，較前市增加一三一七石，其中以碾秞居最多數，一二〇五石，蕪湖糙秈二五〇石，杜秈一九石，埠秈九四〇石，薄稻五〇石，白粳四五石，米號自運自銷一七七二石，又五〇包，至於市塲趨勢，一如往昔，未有變更，麵粉亦少上落，油市生油貨少，加千元，豆油貨多，平正，黃豆仍居呆局，豆餅汕頭略取，市形上升一二百元，午時轉懈，蠶豆平庸，生仁平疲，麩皮胃呆，價小一二百元，綠豆去化不爽，市勢不振，小麥外埠消化寥寥，形勢軟化。</p>
<h3>川米運輸量</h3>
<p>七月份可增爲三萬噸</p>
<p>運濟湘鄂京滬之川糧三百萬石，因船隻缺乏，預定每月運米萬噸之計劃，致難如期實現，茲悉現當局正增調船隻趕運，尤注重川江一段之運輸，重慶至宜昌一段，民生公司大小船隻，已調用十餘艘，招商局之江合，江慶，强華之華源，華同，協大之協興，合衆之長虹，長征，大達之江康等，均征調宜渝段運糧，下月我接收美方之登陸艇十五艘，亦增加該段使用，據聞下月份起，川米運量可增至三萬噸，預計八月中旬，則可運輸竣事。</p>
<h3>無湖米價平疲</h3>
<p>蕪市米價曾極度波動，嗣經各方努力平抑，已告穩定，現蕪市米價，機米每石三萬六千元，熟米三萬一千元，糙米三萬元。</p>
<h3>公價續挫</h3>
<p>公債昨續吿微挫，交易仍在零星點綴之下，稍形活動，惟大勢已無特變，起仆有限，統丙高價八百元，低價七〇〇元，想差不過一百元，雜牌更爲呆滯，結果各使復吿微挫。</p>
<h3>花呢成交不惡</h3>
<p>呢絨市面昨仍穩平，除夏令貨爲時間關係而下游外，餘均形成欲漲乏力，欲跌不能之狀况，蓋其產存枯乏異常，美貨運到祗有女色呢企呢等寥寥數種，以致造成賣方看漲，買方看跌之怪現象，細毛綫織成之袍料及西裝花呢，素色板四條子人字方格元棕藏灰藍綠靑色昨則咸有談判成交，蓋因市貨流通缺乏，銷路不久即可發動云。</p>
<h3>國藥交易蘭珊　手片獨放異彩</h3>
<p>國藥父易俱屬零星，故市鮮榮辱，惟手片獨放異彩，蓋因存底枯竭，適在銷令，各方需胃孔亟，執貨者奇貨可居，遂致冉升，竟高呌七千元左右。</p>
<h3>紗價逐步向上　現棉交清價俏</h3>
<p>昨日紗市益形堅挺，大型雙馬高據在上，站定一五八萬左右，與上日無甚漲跌，惟中小型廿支紗，叩取者衆，價升二三萬，良以與雙馬價距太多，頗有逐漸爬上之趨勢，四十二支雙股及卅二支單紗，仍無進展，午時紡建照例開紗，價與上期相仿，惟卅二支藍鳳單紗標低二萬元。</p>
<p>昨日紐約美棉電訊漲風變本加厲，又在漲五十至五十五磅音，計近期美金三一·〇三，遠期三一·二〇，米特林現貨三一·六六，本埠現棉市况價俏交淸，因結賬假在邇，一部份廠商預備結束賬務，不願多所舉動，是以交易不若上日之旺，僅新生紗廠採辦普通米特林四百包，價格仍高二三千元。</p>
<h3>中央施展壓力　金價較前收稍跌　港票套買交易仍殷</h3>
<p>烚赤昨再進展至二〇五萬以上高價，中央稍施壓迫，堅後趨盤，晨開平平，開後求過於供，游資續來活動，盤高至二〇五萬左右，始感受壓力，漲勢遭阻，十時後中央配給一一三條，價二〇二萬五，十時後開始回挫，多方稍感失望，買氣銷沉，近午曾破入二百萬元大關少許，惟爲時亦暫，午刻在二〇一萬以上掙扎，午後銀根報緊，斬殺之風復起，金融界恐慌盛傳，回跌至一九八萬光景，結果較前收跌四萬二，飾金廿一萬，紋銀銀元均平，暗拆銀根微緊，息價自一角半至一角八不等。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔仍顯疲態，開後雖被金價帶高至二七四〇元，惟爲時至暫，不久即復軟化，迨金市回挫，午刻又退至二六九〇元左右，午後金市回跌，更爲不振，結果較前收回跌六十元，套頭在七四四元左右對十兩，港票套買仍殷，惟因連朝多日離六百元目光已近，昨市買方見高稍止，結果仍漲十元，港電五六〇元，印匯六九〇元，英匯九千元，成交以印匯居多，美匯仍乏變化。</p>
<h3>六底封關影響　華股賣風大熾</h3>
<p>華股昨以封關之故，大部份做至昨日爲止，拆息激起賣風，多方了結頻仍，開後最高時永紗五五二元，美亞三五〇〇元，景福二三八元，新光二五〇元，勤與二〇〇元，陸續步跌，午刻均呈低價，冷門中小型亦都被帶小，結果較前收計永紗美亞回跌半成，景福等三小熱所跌有限，冷門中小型各跌半成左右，元老股尙平，收後塲外喊價續低。</p>
<p>外股受華股同一影響，浮多不能支持，紛有了結，以致高價時不易持久，惟低後仍有大戶吸收，尙形平穩，近午轉盤，怡紗上塲一〇三〇〇元，英聯九五〇〇元，怡啤二三〇〇元，不久即被出籠所壓制，怡紗曾退至九一〇〇元而後稍回，結果較前收怡紗鋼業各跌半成强，怡啤會德豐微升，亞洲英聯微挫，業廣紙業則平。</p>

<h3>華茶無法出口　總由成本太高</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨訪某茶業中人，詢以最近華茶外銷情况。據談：目前棗茶內銷及外銷前途，均呈黯淡。以內銷言，過去國內茶葉最大之銷塲爲東九省。茲以時局不靖，茶商多觀望。最近各地茶葉集中天津後，皆未出關運銷東北各省市，故天津茶價，亦吿瀉跌。至華茶外銷前途，以月前之現狀言，實無法抬頭。良以多年戰亂，我國一般物價，陸續騰踊約五千倍。而美英諸國一般物價，不過漲起三成。物價步漲之比例，相去太遠。遂使向以價廉物美著稱之華茶，竟成外人目中之奢侈品。美英各國對華茶之需要雖甚殷切，惟價格方面，實感無法迎合。故甚望政府當局，對華茶外銷，應設法以津貼辦法補助，以救華茶垂危之局云。</p>
<h3>福州經茶　英商派員搜購　已有相當數量</h3>
<p>日前本市英商怡和協和兩洋行，鑒於滬市茶價高昂，難合胃口因聞福州產區，市而廉宜，故均紛紛派員前往搜購，茲據同業消息，已有相當數量之紅茶成　，每担約在國幣四萬元間，不久均擬打包出口，至於本市茶葉市况，各稱內銷茶，貨方仍一味扳售不鬆，惟本街店莊鑒於六底迫臨，胃納趨減，致趨勢大有進出兩寂之槪，交易遂見遜色，情况一再堅穩不變，惟其中以台灣紅茶及芽茶，無錫，宜興等地去化賡續蟬聯，市氣仍被拉抬向上。</p>
<h3>輸入品設計會　已在滬開始辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕外匯開放時，中央規定設置輪入品設計委員會，隸屬於最高經濟委員會，爲審核進出口貨之諮詢機關，還都以後，以本埠爲吾國經濟重心，擬將該會移滬，茲悉，此事業已實現，其主任委員爲李榦，已由京來滬主持一切，其地點在外灘中央銀行樓上，該會成立以後，對進出口物資，將切實加以研討，該會並將聘請專家多人，參加工作。統計專家盛灼三氏，已由該會羅致矣。</p>
<h3>美棉激漲原因　價格統制法案　參院可能通過</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約廿八日電〕昨日紐約棉花做價甚高，其原因係由於參議院可能通過價格統制法案，通過後總統即將簽字，按該法案正式成立以後，棉花將完全成爲「自由」貿易，昨日開盤時尙頗平穩，但至下午即縱漲增高，佔計昨日成交約三二五，〇〇〇包。</p>
<h3>綸昌棧單交涉</h3>
<p>持單人推定代表</p>
<p>棉布公會爲英商綸昌印染廠所出棉布棧單糾紛，召集全體棧單持有人會議，商討交涉方針事，已誌昨日本報，昨日該公會開會，到棧單持有人九十四單位，並有公會法律顧問王效文律師等出席，當由董理事長久峰主席，報告本事件自去年十二月中發現，以迄現在之呈請交涉經過情形，旋經討論交涉方針，議決同意於公會所擬之分攤辦法，並推定陳國樑王天授丁兆蘭卜宗道董久峰曹者禧陳振華陳寳新鄭緯章等九人爲持單人代表，向綸昌廠交涉，並由全體持單人前往該廠要求提貨云。</p>
<h3>土糖雖相繼到滬　糖市現貨軋缺</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕招商局海皖輪，前日自汕頭到滬，運來食糖一千七百餘包，又延閱輸自廈來滬，運來食糖三千二百餘包，昨已起卸，但糖市續在現貨軋缺狀態下，冉冉上升，公會劃盤現貨中砂白初劃十一萬七千元，旋至十二萬元及十一萬九千元，第五期棧單十一萬三千元，路貨十萬〇九千元至八千元，提靑劃出少數，價爲十萬〇七千元，號貨開出興化赤百餘簍，十一萬五千元，刁靑一百包，十萬元，升二千元，黃崗靑八十包，十萬〇二千五百元，市象暫乏髻象。</p>
<h3>商情摘要</h3>
<p>木材　杉木價仍步漲不已，柳安夾板價亦見好，餘貨亦一致堅穩。</p>
<p>苧蔴　以銷路呆滯，價格遂呈呆板狀態，外埠裝滬之苧蔴，因運費浩大，成本甚高，行商又不能提高收價，故到貨亦少。</p>
<p>野蠶絲近來到貨稀少，攷其原因，一方面由於運輸不暢，另一方面則爲滬價尙低，對外埠未能起吸引作用，業中人推測，最近各項野　絲價格，或將予以提高，以利外銷云。</p>
<p>牛油　為夏季生產之工業油脂，工業用戶，因季節關係，多競購儲用，一月以來，價漲一倍有餘，昨日市上喊價，已達十三萬五千一担，但僅可買到小量貨色。</p>
<p>柏油　價亦復上颶，原因係牛油報漲，柏油亦隨之跟上，加以產地價格，與滬相彷，兼之阨於運輸，價遂難平復。</p>
<p>草蓆　旺銷期已成過去，致市况頗為穩定，僅軟蓆一項，因汽車坐熱需用頗多，故市銷轉暢，價亦稍升。</p>
<h3>桐油外銷七千噸　戰前每年達七十萬噸</h3>

<h3>訪老戰士褚輔成　一個爭取民主民意的典型</h3>
<p>— 特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>杭州廿五日通訉</p>
<p>當「民主」被人們利用著作爲幌子，而真民主黯然失色的時候，記者惦念着一位畢生爲民主而奮鬥的老戰士褚輔成先生。褚先生的一生，可謂是中國民主的民意代表的模範。從民國初年參與國會起，一直到現在担任國民參政員止，無一時無一處不是代表着眞正的民意的。</p>
<p>反袁被拘　擊獄兩載</p>
<p>民國四年，袁世凱與日本締結二十一條不平等條約，褚先生當時在北平，盡力反對，後來察知袁世凱在企圖完成其稱帝的迷夢，便奔走呼號，堅決反對。結果被袁軟禁起來，硬要他贊成帝制，他仍是悍然反對，袁馬上派兵把他拘禁，原想送到浙江的山地裏去監囚，但褚先生是浙江人，深恐對他有所優待，所以改送安徽囚禁，在獄中足足的挨度了兩年，但他還不灰心，還是一樣的戰鬥着。民國六年，褚先生鑒於國事日非，於是南下廣東，組織非常國會，褚先生被推爲非常國會副議長，選舉國父爲非常大元帥。</p>
<p>痛恨曹錕　退出國會</p>
<p>民國十二年國會衆議員選舉大總統，當時褚光生爲衆議院議員，無恥的曹錕想强姦民意，行賄議員，選舉自己爲大總統，常時褚先生堅決反對，而且在議會上公開攻擊，認爲在民主正在萌芽的時候，橫遭曹錕如此摧殘，眞是痛心疾首，所以褚光生沒有選舉，便宣吿退出國會。後來鑒於國家益形衰弱，政治益形腐敗，人民在水深火熱之中，而當政者猶爭構奪剝，他便又南下參加北伐，回到了自己的家鄉，曾主持過一個時期的浙江政權，但總究抱着爲民呼籲的精神而重又回到了民間。從民國十六年到民國廿六年這一段冗長的歲月裏，他在上海辦學。廿六年隨國都至西南，爲國事奔走，爲抗戰努力。</p>
<p>此次南來　呼籲兩事</p>
<p>抗占勝利了，褚先生才於今年五月由重慶乘輪到南京，由南京到上海，由上海到他的老家嘉興，再由嘉興到杭州來。他已八九年沒有回家了，回到家鄉，目覩着農村受敵偽的蹂躪後的殘破情形，實在有無限的感慨。記者在一個將近傍晚的下午，在淸泰路一輛小轎車中訪晤着了褚先生。我見他比在重慶時更淸瘦了些，但精神仍很健旺，一種堅挺不拔的神情，由他睜得大大的眼睛中表達出來。他吿訴記者說：此來並非遊習性質，而是爲着兩件事：一件就是嘉興平湖的徵購軍糧，似嫌過重，所以想訪晤沈主席後，籲請减少一些。一件是爲了田賦微實，他了解政府田賦徵實的意義，他對於田賦徵實原則上是贊成的，但因着田賦徵實的一些零星問題，比如儲運，度量衡，成色等，以往有很多弊病，現在希望能設法免除。所以他一面要向沈主席說，一面要和浙省臨時參議會議長朱獻文老先生商量，尋求一條解決這些問題的途徑。</p>
<p>根本問題　復與經濟</p>
<p>他捋着　動的髯　說：「事在人為，問題總可以解決的！「眞够積極的語氣，我順便問：「國共談判的問題，你看如何呢？」</p>
<p>「我看是有辦法的。」又是積極的語氣。他接着說：「我們看一樁事情，要向有辦法處去看，如國共合作的問題，我看到政府處處容忍，處處讓步，共產黨實際上也不想戰爭，又加馬歇爾在中間調解，我想遲早總可以獲得合作的協議的。</p>
<p>「老實說，你問一問中國隨便那一個老百姓，誰還願意內戰呢？旣然老百姓不願意作內戰，那麼誰發動內戰，就是誰違背民意，現在共產黨在束北與蘇習皖邊區動武，致使人民流亡，確是痛苦萬狀，怨聲載道。這與政府將勝利時接收人員的不得法，不得人，同樣的違背民意，失却民心的，也許其嚴重性更甚於接收大員當時的情形。」</p>
<p>「我認爲目前的根本問題，就在如何解決當前的經濟問題。如果還要作戰，經濟眞要頻於不可收拾之境了！現在老百姓偽是到山窮水盡痛苦難忍的時候，實在不能再以戰學的痛苦加諸人民身上了！」</p>
<p>「這次國共問題在整軍方案上，共產黨堅持成見，國民黨也認爲這是最低限度，談判比較因難吧？」記者又提及這個問題。</p>
<p>「整軍方案不難解決，整軍的整個原則，已在一月間就決定了的。駐軍區的問題，我很相信馬歇爾一定有一個比較公正的處理。馬歇爾我對他也很信任的啊！」</p>
<p>第三方面　務要公正</p>
<p>他又說：「希望第三者方面的態度要不偏不倚，不偽自已打算。要眞正站在公正的立塲上說話，這樣才有團結的好果，才有眞正表達民主民意的機會。」褚先生講完了這幾句話，仍舊抱着樂觀積極的態度。我看他精神上如此年輕活潑，令我回憶起在兒時嘉興公共體育塲講演廳上聽他揮動拳頭大勝演講的神情。我眞想不到他已是七十四歲的高齡了。</p>
<p>他的體軀雖被頻年奔走奮鬥的經歷减弱了不少，但他隱約可辨的幾根嶙峋的肩骨是非常堅賓鐵硬。</p>
<p>我們的小轎車已到褚先生暫寓的英士路五十四號門前，記者下了車，道一聲「謝謝」！褚先生吿訴記者：「我二十七日下午，就回上海去了。國家的前途還是樂觀的啊！」</p>
<h3>空軍第八大隊東渡記</h3>
<p>— 朱民威</p>
<p>離滬　前夕</p>
<p>六月十八日晚上，上海空軍俱樂部裏面空軍第八大隊宴請前任大隊長徐康良司令陳嘉尙處長以後，在舞廳的光滑地板上，軍官們與舞伴夾雜着穿行跳舞。安錫九科長在我們的桌子邊坐下。</p>
<p>「你們定於後天走，知道嗎？」</p>
<p>他說的「後天走，」是說二十日這天飛東京。記者得到空軍總司令局至柔將軍准許，隨機飛東京一次之後，來上海等候起飛，已經有十多天了，聽到行期就在目前，心中自然高興。</p>
<h3>王大隊長　舞得那麼興奮</h3>
<p>我心目中對於第八大隊的全部人員是懷養好感的，大隊長王世　雖也相熟，但相處時間不多，對於他的爲人及性格，只聽他人傳言，還不能說十分淸楚。我聽了安科長說王大隊長自己也去，才明白今天晚上他在舞池裏與太太跳舞那麼興奮的原因了。</p>
<p>他的太太謝滿珍是成都華西壩區域裏的一個牙醫學生，豐滿而修長，一付恬靜面孔與不多言的沉寂態度，構成美麗的外表，王大隊長因為在空軍任職，且在實地戰爭，遲到卅歲任空軍第二大隊大隊長時方才結識謝，才戀愛，才結婚，婚後人們都說他夫妻間情感濃厚，我與王大隊長數次晤談，都在軍營中，今晚他遞過來招呼的眼色是那麼活潑愉快，我忽然感覺這不是一個三十五歲空軍中校大隊長，二千人的小統帥，而是一個年靑的飛行員，而且正在追回消失於戰爭歲月中的靑春，正在向一個年靑美麗姑娘戀愛的飛行良。</p>
<p>這一個晚上，我　　了久已想一晤的劉益之少校。益之是浙江鎭海人，高大身材，說一口浙東音的普通話。他在作戰歲目中，除了一般軍官業務外，尙能以其愛思棠的習慣從中國空軍見地去想一想許多空軍的間題，並且有很多系統的想法寫出來。一本單行本「銀色的迷彩」可說是他的思潮大海中一朶小浪花。</p>
<p>我座上有人設：</p>
<p>「王大隊長太太以及別幾位太太不是跳得很好嗎？錢祖倫先生爲何不跳呢」？</p>
<p>「王大隊長後天要出發，誰願分割他們夫婦間的良宵」？</p>
<p>精悍堅強　劉少校不下海</p>
<p>人們永遠同情行將別離的人，尤其是經過戰爭殘酷生活後，格外人們珍貴情感生活。像劉益之少校這種生活態度，多少因爲在戰爭生活中弄得相當堅强而理智，他在國內不是不可以學跳舞，但覺得要花腦力體力的地方還多，所以沒有分精神到這上面來。到美國學飛Ｂ-24的一年間，不是不能學跳舞，也因爲忙於吸收美國高度科學精神食糧，面孔上皺紋現出來，跳舞的愉快終於放棄了。他說：</p>
<p>「慢慢我也要學一學的。」　我忽然想到一個空軍建設的根本問題。</p>
<p>「你以爲空軍建軍的根本問題是什麼？」</p>
<p>「機械！」他很直率而毫不思索的答覆，旋即加以補充：</p>
<p>「飛行，這一方面可以說只要有訓練，就毫無問題，譬如抗戰八年中，中國飛行員對於什麼飛機只要學一樣，總可以會一樣。現在Ｂ-25　Ｂ24兩稱飛機中國人都可以飛，Ｐ-40,　Ｐ38　Ｐ51都也能飛，可是世界上飛機一天一天在進步，我們辛辛苦苦學會飛的飛機，在人家早已又成了古董。一旦國際戰爭發生，古董是對抗不了新武器的，國際和平時代，你沒有力量，均勢不能樹立，必然要落於人後而不能並駕齊驅。要解決空軍建設問題根本非在機械方面樹立相常基礎不可。」</p>
<p>我們在俱樂部樂隊的柔和迷人的聲音中眼看着一塲跳舞接着一塲跳舞，談話是無法深入的，只好東扯西拉。我知道這些年靑人知道的事多，因爲他們經常擠在世界大排塲里，看人家力的表現，感觸特多，爲了預祝東京往返順利，我也很高興的去舞池裏舞了一陣子。</p>
<p>機塲風光</p>
<p>上海第二個大飛機塲是在大塲，空軍第八大隊就在這機塲附近駐營這營房，先前是日本空軍　營，矮矮的小平屋，小小的間頭，在里面辦公，休息，眞是有點嫌小。可是如果回溯第八大隊過去八年間所駐的成都太平寺軍營，蘭州新營房軍營，四川彭山軍營，也就不覺得不適了。大塲軍營里在進餐時，軍官們聚集得最多，他們這些不成立家庭的硬小夥子，有說有笑的在白桌布台面上邊吃邊談。</p>
<p>十九日傍晚，我到大塲軍營，會見副隊長　彭年，大隊附陳景祜等。飯後我去看醫務長劉錫恭，他談到夏天二千八的集團醫務。如像噴D.D.T.，爲全體人員及眷屬注射霍亂預防針以及每天七十名左右士兵的診療。不知不覺談到整個空軍醫務。他提到杭州筧橋空軍軍官學校校醫院的設計工作。他的意見是空軍醫務必須從根本上建立配合飛行業務，否則飛行業務將受損害。劉醫務長雖在第八大隊，可是他的氣魄及寬坦性格，常叫他想到全局。</p>
<p>飛行準備　全部陸續完成</p>
<p>晚間豪雨如注，心中非常想家中人，感情的作用在我心中常起波動，但我已慣於壓制情感。二十日淸早，起身後，收拾了行李包，還借了三十三中隊的日本地圖，即搭車赴大塲機塲。雨是止了，機塲地面水門汀跑道已乾，但跑道外柔泯草塲上均有積水，天空雨雲濃厚，遇簫强兄。他是八大隊氣象官，隨他到飛行管理室看天氣，才知由上海起，到日本本土止，沿途海上是漫天風雲，雲很低，不及一千尺高。雲厚二萬尺，如果雲是可以使用的物質，這一天儲　可驚人。風速是二十英里，順航綫向東北吹，王國南上尉已於淸晨赴江灣美軍基地，取天氣預報，並塡簽飛行許可表。飛機早已準備好，機號四百八十五，停在靠近管理室的滑行道旁邊。搭乘這飛機的駐日代表國朱世明團長及其十二名團內工作人員，亦陸續乘車到達。王大隊長世　也到了，一切飛行準備均已完成，只等飛行員王國南由江灣回來。</p>
<p>楊槐爲我借了一具坐傘，這東西我有一年多沒接近過了，因爲海洋飛行，又找了一具浮水圈。楊槐爲我套上，並敎我用時把二粒黑電木柄一拉，即爲輕氣充溢其中，這裏面夾層縫了一袋半磅白藥粉。在巡邏飛機經過漂海地點時一拉開藥包，海水即會把白藥粉製成一大塊白烟，引起機上人來發現這個孤獨而急於求救的漂海者。</p>
<p>鳴啦一聲　我機開始轉動</p>
<p>我擠在Ｂ-24的駕駛艙與炸彈艙之間六尺見方的無綫電室內。這小小的地方，左邊是油箱數量表，暖氣開關，以及管制機械的儀表，右邊是無綫電員的工作桌面。就在這小小的室內，擠了朱世明團長與四位女打字負，我，以及卅四中隊機務一長徐書林上尉，通信員陳功　中尉，領航員黃爾毅中尉等八個人，駕駛臉內王大隊長坐右面，王國南坐左面。飛機的機門是在機腹下，用開關管制的。等到人都登機，（另七名搭乘人員，在後面射擊艙內。）以後，鋁質波紋形機門嘩嘩的閉上了。這以後，全機中人的命運全在駕駛員的手中揑着了。</p>
<p>機務長徐書林在駕駛室二個駕駛員座椅後站着，他生得大眼大鼻頭，還有一張大嘴。身材中等，結實壯健，他注意駕駛艙的儀表，並且聽着王大隊長在四個發動機噪音中，大聲唸讀黑表上的白字。那每個字是代表飛機上飛行時所必需的每一個機關。這種起飛前的逐一檢查，等於是過一個重要關口。王大隊長唸一道，王國南上尉就注視一下他所唸的儀表。等到這幾十個字讀完，幾十個儀表衣也檢查完畢，徐書林就打開無綫電室天窗，伸頭在窗外指揮飛機向跑道滑行，飛機機械發出「嗚拉」「嗚嗚拉」的怪聲。飛機在轉移，兩王的手把握着駕駛盤，左轉右轉。進到跑道起點，這時是九點十五分，天空雲幾乎散在三百尺高的低空。雨點從徐書林所站的天窗裏打進來。這是海上要刮風暴，落大雨的時候，兩王開始起飛，這架銀色Ｂ24在轟轟的機聲中離開了大塲機塲，浸沉於漫空的白雲與大雨之中。（廿二日）</p>

<h3>促建浦江大橋</h3>
<p>主筆先生：報載市公用局正計劃建築下列各項新事物：（一）二十條地道，（二）蘇州河上架設更多橋樑，（三）興起高架電車，通至四郊。該項計劃，對於本市交通大有裨益。因勝利以來，本市車輛大增，而街道不甚寬闊，拆屋拓路，又不易實施，惟有另謀良策方能補救。彼歐美及日本各大都市，因早有是項交通設備矣，深盼市公用早局日將此計劃付諸實現。今另有一項，擬請亦列入計劃之中，即前曾一度提及之興建黃浦江大橋是也。建造此橋，至少有下列五大優點：（一）便利交通，節省時間與金錢。（二）疏散人口至浦東地區，可免市區過份擁擠。（三）利用浦東地價較廉，大量建造平民住宅及公務員宿舍，可减除市區房荒之嚴重性。（四）造橋時需要大量建築人才與工人，可補救一部份失業問題。（五）發展浦東商業，直接增加政府稅收。造橋材料，聯總援華救濟物資中亦有運到。如因該項材料較小致不能全部適用，可轉請行總代爲申請。至建築所需一切費用，除由政府担負若干，外餘可由市府發行公債。預料橋成之後，浦東商業必大爲繁榮，稅收亦可大增，即以所增稅金分期還本，常無甚困難也。曹俊靑謹上，六月十一日。</p>
<h3>小学畢業額外收費</h3>
<p>編者先生：我是一個學生。像我的家，父母出錢讓子女去讀書，當然是很困難的。我的妹妹是在南京路慈淑大樓底層的××小學校六年級讀書，今年暑期畢業。昨天妹妹放學回家，對我訴說，校中有位被學生呼爲師母的女敎師盛某，向學生提議開畢業大會，每人必需交一萬元作爲送禮。我聽後頗爲詫異！一個學校畢業時開畢業大會是有的，可是又要什麼錢送禮呢？所以我跟妹妹說，咱第二次學費也交過了，什麼雜費也交齊了，開畢業會每人也用不了一萬元，老實說，咱交不起。而妹妹却哭着說，先生說不交就不予畢業，限這星期內交齊。我無法，祇得好言相哄。先生，您是熱心敎育的人，難道畢業必需出一萬元的代價嗎？金壽謹上。六月十八日。</p>

<h3>心安理泰</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>跛者不忘履，眇者不忘視，一個人生理上有缺陷，心理上也容易不平衡，心理上有恐懼種種情况，亦然。</p>
<p>嚴淺近的例子，可以用戴太陽眼鏡來說明，有許多不相干的女人，無論天晴天陰，無論室內室外，總是那麼一副，她們之中固然有不少認爲「此乃時髦」，但大多數恐在不能示人以色相罷！</p>
<p>在國際外交舞臺上翻手爲雲覆手爲雨的日戰犯前外相松岡洋右頃已病死於東京帝大醫院，在投機前曾寫小詩一首，大意是：「不怨天，不尤人，我沿着黑暗的路往下走」。</p>
<p>騙款一億二千萬的飛達證券號主童成德，到了拘留所後，會找機會和那位交際花談話，呌她不要承認藏在家裏的美金票和公債，吾則罪無可這等語。</p>
<p>松岡與童成德，身分大不相同，行徑亦迥然有異，然而他們心理上的恐慌則一，所以最後會不白禁地吐露出「心曲」來的。</p>
<p>談到這里，又將牽扯到性善性惡的爭論了。一個人，老實說，總在求心安理泰，天下其所以沒有秘密的事存在者，原因就在每個人都在追求心安理理泰。別以爲邦些用非法的手段攫取了非份的享受的人煊赫一時，令人艷羨，而靈魂的最深處，其苦痛不是汽車洋房女人金條所可塗飾的。而這個社會之所以並未完全墮落到人喫人，人騙人，人不像人的境地者，正有若千心安理泰之人，也正有若干人以心安理泰爲人生同標耳。</p>
<h3>吃狗肉</h3>
<p>— 方君</p>
<p>狗肉是廣東人特嗜的一種肉類，雖則說，不吃狗肉的廣東人也有；然而，不吃狗肉的廣東人之在廣東，除非是老一輩的女性，或者是有其不吃的原故的男人外，可以說是鳳毛麟角了。狗在廣東，在另一種塲合上看來，要不是牠超過了年齡，全是被認爲無上妙品的。所謂超過年齡也者，以其年齡超過三歲以上則不適宜於食，故俗語有云：「老狗嫩貓兒，食死有（作無字解）人知」。以其年齡長了，肉便有毒，跟河啄一樣，食之足以致命；但河豚祗要烹調得法，尙無大礙，老狗則不然，其爲害之烈，使嗜食狗肉者也談而色變。</p>
<p>狗肉的烹調在廣東人那種技術特有專長，能够烹出各種不同味兒的菜色，有人而且可以將之烹成九　。但普通烹法多是紅燜，以古勞麵豉，生薑，油，酒，糖之類滲和，以瓦鍋置炭爐中，隨燒隨食，有的還加附子，或者烏豆，最後是加青菜。其味腴美，還加上一個「香」字，故又名「香肉」。香肉普遍於廣東令省的民間，尤其是夏至及重陽兩個節候所不能免的食品。民間有以狗肉來招待新客的，我八年前回到鄉間，就有父老專誠請我去吃狗筵。不過鄉間吃狗肉不能在家裏吃的，多數在菓園之中，大樹之下或者郊外，這原故我不大明瞭，然而婦女們則避之若侮了。</p>
<p>廣東人對狗肉是一種特嗜之外，還當它是補品。假如，有人受着長期的瘧疾，給醫治痊可了，在那痊可了之後的兩星期至一個月之中，定以狗肉來作培補之物，據說，它不但是補虛培元，抑且是防止瘧疾永不再發。是否我固不知，每個鄉人却都抱着如此的見解。但，這是一種很普遍的情形，要是廣東人，除了上說的之外，在一年裏面如其不會吃過狗肉，總認是一件憾事，比害過瘧疾的人對於這種需求來得急切。</p>
<p>我對於狗肉本來不大愛好，雖然回鄉時也曾有鄉中父老請過我吃了幾回，然都是淺嘗　止，不敢　量，因此引動了父老讓我的體質不佳，就因爲不多食狗肉的原故。他們說：「黃狗補膊，黑狗補腎，脾腎兩强，弱從何來？病從何致？」我不敢以他們的理論爲然，雖每一位鄉人都這麼强調的說。可是，我自從三年前給狗嚇過一回之後，就更恨起狗來了，對於狗肉也多吃了。第一是恨至要「食其肉」，以至於這種畜生的像人而不是人的同類-主子。</p>
<p>香港吃狗肉的地方很多，例皆隱名「三六」或者「香肉」，以其向有禁例，不許屠宰。但這禁例已等具文，屠者自屠，而食者白食。狗肉攤上祇是隱去一個狗字，固不必掛上羊頭，而食家已自然聞而自至了。不過，這種狗肉攤子的狗肉類多先用綠豆水泡過的。用綠豆水泡過的狗肉浮厚了許多，然而鮮腴之味就差遠了，不如自烹的來的可口。自烹不免太費手脚，要使人忙上大半天，始得解饞。而且，屠的人也得要事先請上一位，否則，你縱然有鋼刀在手，不一定就可成爲「屠狗之輩。」</p>
<p>狗函的味與猪牛羊的大有不同，而且油而不膩，尤其香味十足，在烹調時，使人在老遠也能聞到。</p>
<p>廣東人固是無狗不食，但也有他揀擇之處，是以有句話：「第一黃，第二烏，斑白不如無。一這是說明狗肉以黃狗的爲第一（補脾）黑者為第二（補腎），花毛狗與由毛狗則有不如無，以其不補脾又不補督也。</p>
<p>在上海的廣東人是不大吃狗肉的，他們都說：「上海是佛地，吃了狗肉會死人」。所以我在上海以前住上了二十年就不會見有廣東人屠狗，然而，也許是自已沒有見到罷。至於「上海是佛地」這句話兒，尤其無稽得可以。</p>

<h3>官有二口　上隻講是　下隻講否</h3>
<p>— 馮憶</p>
<p>做「官」，天生有二隻口，上隻口講是，下隻口講吾，頭上戴着一項大帽子，說話有絕對自由。</p>
<p>節約糧食，最好的方法，多吃「維他命丸」，「魚肝油精」，「克寗奶粉」和「花旗橘子」。</p>
<p>一位外國朋友盛讚中國人吃飯有藝術，「認爲用刀用叉還有些原始時代的意味，中國人用筷子，僅僅憑着五個指頭，二條小槓子，可以做到一切，已是到達人類進化史上爐火純靑的地步，這顯然是進化，是文明！」常我聽到進化和文明的時候，不免受　若驚，不知道是捧場呢？還是諷刺？</p>
<p>高工資和高物價所引起的經濟嚴重問題，外尚在替我們乾着急。可是我們這些進口商人，正認爲這是混水摸魚，賺錢的好機會。要不是「高工資，高物價」，外貨如何能銷得動？</p>
<p>「欲求交通管制有辦法，必光淘汰人力車」，「欲朮淘汰人力車，必先利用機動車」，於是不久將來，將有大批公共汽車和大量吉普車參加行駛，但願從此以後，交通管制果如理想中的有條不紊，鷄犬皆寗！</p>
<p>太平洋戰事期間，美軍賴以噴火器殲滅琉璜島頑抗的日軍，想不到從琉璜島進駐天津的美軍，居然還有借重噴火器的一天，而用來　滅軍糧城的蝗災。同樣一件武器，前者可以殺人，後者可以救人，這就是「戰爭與和平」唯一的不同點！</p>
<p>據南京電訊：「孫院長科平日代步之別克小轎車照會爲四個一字，頗引人注意，聞此車爲敵偽產業接收以後，由馬市長超俊轉贈院長者。」由此使人聯想到一些芝蔴綠荳官，神通廣大，遠較院長有辦法，所謂「山不在高，有仙則靈」，信哉此言！</p>
<h3>印話　章法</h3>
<p>— 高甜心</p>
<p>章法，即布白，亦即安頓，亦即研究如何配字。方寸之間，所蓄者精，所含者廣，其用心不亞於作一丈八尺之畫，蓋一小天地也。刻印有四法：篆法，筆法，章法，刀法。四法之中，愚見則以章法最爲緊要。何則，作畫書對體大，印則體小。故印之筆法，尙可馬虎，筆法自然要考據精當。刀法蒼勁得之矣。此三者皆不能單獨成事，惟有章法一門獨具巧竅。章法好，即爲美印。印之美醜，完全關係章法也，而印之所以可頑，亦即頑的章法。而刻印一藝最難者，亦即要先得章法，其有章法脫俗，出奇，美感，藝術者，鮮有作者不曾嘔過一翻心血也。致於章法要能得好的來源，第一要多看原拓好印譜，第二要有天才。原拓好印譜，價甚昂，窮印人，刻字匠，如何買得起？如何買得全？故坐令一班有財力之無聊文人視印人之作品，奇貨可居，惟我獨尊，專家印人，鳳毛麟角突。慨夫天才，乃於疎密有致之中，得失寸心知，意會而不可言傳，但還是要兩者配合起來才有根據，才會佳妙。</p>
<h3>吃五方　和尚的隨員</h3>
<p>— 王瑛元</p>
<p>在一個角落裏，存在着這麼一個組織，多少人靠這奇怪的收入維持着生計。</p>
<p>原來那地方附近，有着許多廟宇寺院，裏面當然有些和尙。這些和尙，平常就不守淸規，終年酒肉不斷。每到春天，他們就成霧結歐去隣省化緣，收入郤頗豐富，足够一年揮霍。原來這班禿兒們，雖不「正」派，究竟還算有「資格」到後來，擴充了。</p>
<p>大概每一二正式的和尙爲一單位，先在附近鄉村，邀集三五無知農民，爲隨員，組爲一小組，每人衣鉢全套，由和尙率領出發化緣。一切開支，統由和尙統籌墊款，隨從工資，由和尙酌量給予，隨從的任務，大概在旅途時，司挑伕責，駐定時則日夜分頭沿街唸經，頗爲辛苦，而和尙反而看家。唸經工作吿竣後，和尙與隨員再一同挨戶化緣，收入當然不錯。</p>
<p>到後來，「假」貨日增，幾乎每村子成年男人，每年全部化裝出發。但「眞」貨有限，不能每組均有，於是每組成了全部「假」和尚。全套服裝道具或因經濟能力較差不能先行墊款自備者，則另有一種人，應運而生，就是出租道具，每月收租金若干，於是出租人又有了生活。</p>
<p>此類和尚多目不識丁，能唸句阿彌陀佛，或寫得一筆賬，就算首領了。他們印了很多名山勝境圖。但事實上那裏來這麼許多眞山呢，於是控空心思，把屋後的土坵，也幻想成有樓台亭閣，瀑布山峯，請人畫成寫景國，眞像逢萊仙島一樣，及修理某名山某大殿緣起等文件，這是準備到目的地散發或張貼的。然後各組先後出發，分往各省各地。到達一地後，先行拜訪鄉鎭長，幷餽贈火腿等珍貴禮物。除一人看家外，其餘每人負責一區械，穿全套僧衣，背韋陀像手敲木魚，唸阿彌陀佛。大概白日一次，夜間一次，風雨無阻。不論深更半夜也要穿過森林田野，萬一遇到狼羣就算倒楣。三日後，由鄉鎭保長同往挨戶寫捐，據說近來情形很好，大多數即刻付現，一二千元者大槪放進荷包了事，數萬元以上，始能在捐薄留名。這樣約達四五個月之久，就滿載還鄉。據說今年的生活程度而論，大概除開支外，每人的可分得數十萬或一百餘萬元。</p>
<p>他們爲了農村窮困，才遠走他鄉，也可說是用血汗換售一點酬勞。從某一方面說那些佛弟子們，反正願意樂捐，救救這些人倒也可算慈悲。</p>
<h3>玻璃櫃檯</h3>
<p>— 墨痴</p>
<p>現在散播於各區行人道的那些，動時是車子，靜時是櫃檯的攤頭，這種露天交易，倒不是應運而生，這批玻璃櫃檯，還是　生於上海淪陷時期。那時候每夜「防空」，因此晚上活動於馬路上的市民，身邊都有一段硬绷绷的傢伙——電筒。所以這些玻璃櫃檯的營業範圍，大都是「電料」「捲烟」「糖果」。勝利後這些玻璃櫃檯，曾一度「英雄無用武之地」而擱置了好久。</p>
<p>自從U·S·A·貨品絡續地大批到滬之後，這些玻璃櫃檯又出現於街頭了。目前自命爲時髦的上海人，已一律「美式配備」。試瞧，他們弊架坡璃脚的「抗日鏡」，口袋裏不插一派克」金筆，却樹着一支玻璃木梳，腰　玻璃褲帶，如果是雨天，當然外罩一件玻璃雨衣。可借這血肉之軀的臭皮囊，却不是「發拉史的克」的「來路貨」。</p>
<p>這些玻璃櫃檯，喜歡集中交易，這是迎合買客選擇使利起見，如石路的衣莊，四馬路的醫店。所以大新公司附近以及林森中路的中心地段，是玻璃櫃檯商的大本營。至於售價是否便宜，無奈筆者冥頑不靈，藥用國貨，故對美國貨品之售價，無從介紹，非常抱歉。</p>

<h3>手續簡化　待遇調整</h3>
<p>— 武陵人</p>
<p>上海郵政局通吿，大意謂「爲增進快遞掛號郵件之速率起見，對處理是項郵件之手續試行簡化，請寄信人勿將支票。紅票·郵政匯票·郵票等，裝於快掛郵件之內交寄，以免發生意外時受有損失。」讀此，頗令人　疑到處理手續簡化之後，是吾快掛郵件將增多不能遞到的危險。</p>
<p>颱風登陸後，忽變爲低氣壓，上海得免被襲。關心時局的人也正盼望產局勢像此香颱風的突然變爲低氣壓一樣，無形的消散了，豈不大佳。</p>
<p>當局對國營事業各機關職員待遇，將予减低；中紡公司所屬高級職員之薪津，將自七十萬元减至四十萬元。這當然是非常合理的辦法。只怕除去了一個津貼項目，却又增加了一個項目，結果還是减而未减。</p>
<p>杭州地檢處非法拘押了大同日報記者胡滄粟，激動公憤，結果高院向「後援會」去函表示遺憾和不安，此案總算吿一段落。司法要維持尊嚴，新聞要爭取自由，但如不顧公理，那就談不到「維持」和「爭取」，浙高院之前倨而後恭，便是忽略了這一點，自食其果。</p>
<p>武漢行營召集若干日軍官憲兵，舉行測騐，若　對犯罪行爲，多不承認。日本人的思想和能態度，到今日還是如此，實在應該注意。</p>

<h3>黃汎區搶堵工程</h3>
<p>— 本報記者徐守廉攝</p>
<p>黃河岸畔的花園口，自從廿七年決口後，經連年冲刷，其缺口已擴大到一千四百六十公尺。抗戰勝利以還，政府對於黃災認爲有立即防範的必要，命令黃河水利委員會籌劃堵口復堤工程，同時聯合國善後救濟總署爲協助中國救濟工作，派遺技術人員並運來大量物資，協助我國政府，以謀早日恢復常態。我們就在這種共同合作之下，終於在本年三月一日正式開始動工了。</p>
<p>這當然是一件非常艱鉅的工程，人力雖然沒有問題，可以用以工代賑的方式，來解決難胞的生活，但是因爲交通阻滯，（從上海起運到鄭州的各項物資，非得經過較長的時間無法得達目的地，同時每次所運的材料，又是那末地稀少。）再加上共軍到處阻撓，直到現在，擬在故道下遊挑挖引河的一段工程，還在協商之中，而竟致不能依照原定計劃順利推進，沿河兩岸數千百萬難民，至今尙在水深火熱中，無法援手拯救。</p>
<p>經過四個月來不斷的工作結果，關於堵口工程部份，大部已將完成。此次本報記者隨上海記者團出發視察，本月二十日行抵花園口時，西壩灘上土堤已完成者約一千公尺，東壩亦已完成六十公尺，其間四百公尺的決口，因爲水流湍急，故先打樁搭架便橋，然後再在橋上拋石平堵合龍。最近此項工程，已入拋石階段，不久當可堵塞合龍。花園口，在昔日，原爲一小鎭，並不十分繁盛，現以工作人員驟增，數達萬人以上，成爲熱鬧市鎮。彼等每天工餘之暇輒往「蓮花大鼓」「河南墜子」等娛樂處所苦中尋樂，以求精神上之慰籍。下列各岡，係記者在此次旅途中所攝，茲特實之於每週畫刋，俾讀者亦得領略黃河堵口復堤工程其爲　何根　也、</p>

<h3>說理詩</h3>
<p>— 虞文</p>
<p>我們涉獵古今詩家的名作，發現除去派別，格調等等有　著的差異外，在詩的本質上又可分爲「抒情的」與「說理的」兩種。前者倘　是「尙文」的，而後者則是「尙用」的了。</p>
<p>有些文學批評家以爲詩歌僅可抒情，而說理則　詩。淸代袁枚論詩，標舉性靈，不廢驗體，並援引孔子：「情欲信，辭欲巧」二語以自重。糜島松南的「娛語」評慈湖詩也說：「詩賦之體，宜吟咏有餘韻，如慈湖詩，道學先生幾句議論，讀之梗　，非知詩者也……」云云，大槪詩歌一入說理，不免泥於莊重，陷於苦澁，多失輕妙洒脫之趣，更談不到什麼「筆落成風雨，詩成泣鬼神」了。</p>
<p>然而有的批評家則力主詩歌應該「言中有物」，應該「說理」！並爲達成「厚人倫美敎化，易風俗」的目的。詩歌必須是說理的。葛洪抱朴子辭義篇云：「古詩刺過失，故有益而貴；今詩純慮譽，故有損而賤。」這一派詩論家目進一步將抒情詩目爲無聊的閒話，認爲根本無此浪費筆墨寫作的必要。宋程頤即說一某素不作詩，亦非是禁止不作，但不欲爲此閒言語。且如今言詩無如杜甫，如云：「穿花峽蝶深深見，點水蜻蜓款款飛一，如此閒言語，道出做甚！……」</p>
<p>平情而論，抒情固是詩之上乘，說理亦不失詩之一格。如李誠之所作「山如仁者壽，水似聖之淸」一類的詩句讀來固然覺得理學氣太重，毫無情趣可言；然在中國的屈原，社甫，西洋的史溫朋，華資華斯諸大名家詩歌內，實不乏說理簡明，紀事精鍊之作，那些作品在倫理方面的價値並不爲其在藝術方面的價値所掩，如此說來，可證詩除「抒情」，仍可「說理」！</p>
<p>說理詩近人雖間有作者，但佳篇殊少。記得昔年曾同一般朋友奔走大後方的西北西南從事教化民衆工作，彼時陳立夫先生即曾遙寄一詩云——</p>
<p>中華重邦敎，禮樂爲之輪，成俗貴易俗，化民在親民，風人詢木鐸，終致周南淳，勗哉二三子，耕耘勿辦辛！</p>
<p>此詩有事有物，讀之並不覺其便　，詩趣在有意無意之間，並非全無情感，可以引作說理詩之佳例。</p>

<h3>霉　（小說）　（上）</h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>黃霉大，風裏夾着潮氣。牆壁·桌椅·黑板·書本·甚至身上的衣服，手裏的粉筆，摸上去都是濕膩膩，熱逢蓬，好像剛從蒸籠裏取出來一樣。</p>
<p>馮增壽在黑板上寫完三課書的生字，實在熱得不能耐了。他摸出一塊七穿八洞的手帕揩了揩額上的汗，回過牙來，將手裏一本「復興國語敎科書」在講台上亂拍幾下，向幾十個正在吵鬧的學生喊着：</p>
<p>「這樣熱，吵什應？靜點！靜點！抄生字用不到嘴巴，用不到嘴巴！」</p>
<p>敎室裏果然靜了一靜。然而這一靜中，馮增壽的眼睛，突然觸到一樣東西，——一隻用綠色油光紙摺成的小官帽，端端正正地放在他講合的右角上。</p>
<p>馮增壽蒼白的觀角驀地紅了起來。雖然他敎了十五年書，平素對小學生，還算有涵養。但一瞥見這東西，他再也涵養不住。「砰」的一擊檯子，他衝過去拖住了坐在講台右旁的一個學生，厲聲喝着：</p>
<p>「誰？……誰？……一定又是你……又是你……」</p>
<p>那學生名呌張康元。僅十三四歲光景，可是兩顆烏溜溜的眼烏珠已顯得非常狡滑。被馮先生拖住衣管，他絲毫不怕。因爲他知道自己的爸爸張義林，是地方上的大亭，學校裏的校董。連校長先生的飯碗都揑在他爸爸手裏，還有什麼要怕的？</p>
<p>張康元不怕馮先生。他若無其事地坐着，還賊忒嘻嘻地向旁邊的人扮鬼險。</p>
<p>「你！……你！……你侮辱師長！……」馮先生怒極了，聲音都發了抖，「你給我立起來，……立起來！……」</p>
<p>張　元並沒有立起來，却望著馮先生靑筋凸暴的臉孔，低低的喚了聲「綠帽子」！</p>
<p>「小鬼！你發瘋！……你竟取辱駡師畏！……我拖你去見校長　　去見校長！……」</p>
<p>可是像每次一樣，馮增壽的氣熖高漲到「去見校長」，就突然平熄下來了。這原因，倒不是爲了張康元的父親是大亨，是校驚，覺得害怕。憑良心說，如果跟他搗蛋的不是校董的兒子張康元，而是校工的兒子周小毛，他也不會眞的去見校長的。雖然那種侮辱，簡直比用尖刀刺他的心還厲害，然而開頭無論如何發怒，結果，他至多抓起檯上那隻綠油光紙摺成的小官帽，向牆角裏用力一丟，算是把所有的恥辱也丟了過去，便完了。</p>
<p>今天，馮增壽又好像把所有的恥辱丟在牆角裏了。他沾了滿頭粉筆灰跨出敎室，看見穿西裝的敎務主任楊克仁立在外面，趕緊裝着笑臉喊了聲：「早啊！老楊！」</p>
<p>楊克仁回了聲「平」，但沒有回稱他「老馮」，也沒有笑；却鄭重其事地看了看手錶，問他：「下一堂有課嗎？我有點話想同你談談。」</p>
<p>楊克仁年紀雖輕，記性似乎不大好。明明是他自己派的課程，他派給馮增壽每星期三十五節課，除了每星期期六下午有一堂空外，其餘五犬，塞得螞蟻都爬不進一個、那裏有什麼空課可談話</p>
<p>所以，直到下午散學之後，馮增壽才拍拍掉身上的粉筆灰，跨進了楊克仁的敎務室。</p>
<p>天還是那般悶熱。馮增壽看見楊克仁已把淺灰色的西裝上衣脫下，露着雪白的紡綢襯衫，心裏　實有點羨慕。可是頃刻之間，他的注意力從白紡綢襯衫移到了楊克仁的臉孔，心裏猛然一跳</p>
<p>他看見楊克仁的臉孔上有一股冷氣，聲音也是冷冷的：</p>
<p>「馮先生，照理，你的年齡，你的經騐，都比我大。我是不應該來向你說的，不過爲了學校的名譽，爲了學生的前途，我似乎不能不說，……不能不說！……近來，好像先生的名聲不大好，到底……尊夫人……」</p>
<p>馮增壽不住地用那塊七穿八洞的手帕揩着臉上的汗。聽到「尊夫人」三個字，他淸楚地覺得自己的心在勃突勃突亂跳，可是跳得太輕，似乎不够抵擋楊克仁嘴巴裏繼續送出來的一枝枝冷箭</p>
<p>「是的，我的老婆不大規矩。但與敎務沒有多大關係吧？」似乎實在受不住了，他向楊克仁說了一句，僅這麼一句。</p>
<p>「怎麼沒有多大關係？」楊克仁鄭重其事的聲音：「像今天早晨，我走過六年級敎室，聽聽裏面唸書聲音倒沒有，却在辦着什麼綠帽子紅帽子的交涉。那種情形，非但敗壞學校名譽，更荒廢授課時間，眞是……」</p>
<p>楊克仁滔地「眞是」下去，一篇大道理。馮增壽坐着，靜靜地聽，不動不嚮，像根木頭。</p>
<p>傍晚。天空裏幽暗，悶熱，充滿了難聞的潮氣。</p>
<p>馮增壽木頭似的同到家裏來了。</p>
<p>什麼都像平日一樣，房門上着鎖，開進去後，一眼睛亂七八糟；上上堆滿五顏六色的衣服，床底下堆滿五顏六色的鞋子。檯子上堆滿五顏六色的胭脂，花粉，木梳，臉盆，香肥皂，……</p>
<p>滿眼睛的五顏六色，滿眼睛的昏黑，可是有一樣東西是永遠整齊淸潔的，就是放在窗口的一張小書桌。那上面，有一疊他最心愛的書籍，有他師範畢業時得到的獎牌，還有一張十年前他和妻于在杭州度蜜月時攝的照片。</p>
<p>他默默的走到書桌前，默默的坐了下來，默默的嘆了一口氣</p>
<p>有好幾倘月了，差不多每天下午回家來，他是這個樣十坐在書桌前的。他彷彿把這張書桌當作唯一的朋友。任何疲乏，任何痛苦，只要上坐到這張桌前，就會無聲無息地消散開去。</p>
<p>可是今天，情形變了！他在書桌前坐了將近半小時，渾身的疲乏，滿腔的氣憤，依舊重重地困壓着他。他睜大眼睛盯住桌上的書籍，獎牌，照片；希望像平日一樣，能從這些心愛的東西上面，得些安慰，得些鼓勵，得些諒解；然而沒有用，今天什麼東西都變了！</p>
<p>變了！他眼面前只有一張楊克仁的充滿冷氣的臉孔！</p>
<p>「笑話！這麼一個乳臭未乾的小子，竟敢來敎訓我！」他幾乎這樣喊出來，一隻揑着拳頭的手，幾乎向桌面上擊下去。可是他沒有敢喊，沒有敢繫，他記起了那乳臭未乾的小子，末了一聲冷冷的笑：</p>
<p>「呵呵！馮先生！你別見氣啊！我們天家做夥計，就這樣坦白地談談。當然我決不會去吿訴李校長的，這個請你放心！」</p>
<p>多奸滑的傢伙！竟掮出校長來唬嚇他！呸！吿訴校長便怎麼樣？校長能一口吞掉他嗎？……</p>
<p>他咬咬牙齒。可是僅咬咬牙齒而已。他的喉嚨裏，依舊連蚊子叫那樣「嗡」的一聲，也不敢發出來。他知這，固然校長不能一口吞掉他，但校長有着比一品吞掉他更凶的威力，——能叫他活活餓死！</p>
<p>「活活餓死……活活餓死……活活餓死…」</p>
<p>他痛苦地反覆着這四個字眼。他問自己：竟如此怕死嗎？當然不見得！然而他的確還不願意就死，允其是餓死。他說不出那理由，也不敢去思索。他只常常感到四周有許多莫名的恐懼和威脅，使他變得非常胆怯。</p>
<p>天黑下來了，他還在書桌前坐着。雪亮的燈光從對而人家窗口裏射過來，燈光下有一個年輕的主婦，笑瞇瞇地，立在桌子前安排夜飯。</p>
<p>似乎是一種刺激，馮增壽不願看見這景像，伸手去把一塊藍布窗帘拉上了。</p>
<p>黑暗包圍攬來，他有些怕，將頭伏在桌面上。不多一會，他的妻子回來了。</p>
<p>霉天的深夜。暗濕，凄涼。</p>
<p>二更敲過。妻子早疲乏地熟睡了。但馮增壽還在一盞慘黃的油燈下看書。</p>
<p>不，他實在並不在看書，乃是在看他的妻子。</p>
<p>他不能不承認他妻子的美麗，三十也出外的人了，却依然像處女一樣白嫩紅潤。他也不能不佩服自己當初的手段，能在四五個追逐她的男同事中，獨佔勝利，娶到了她。</p>
<p>然而，娶到了她，他幸福嗎？</p>
<p>他能板著指頭算得出，僅三十天，就是在杭州度蜜月的三十天，他是幸福的。此後，他漸漸明白了，一僩美麗的女人，等於一條美麗的金魚，應該養在考究的玻璃缸裏，安放在細巧的紅木架上。他也明白了，愛情决不是什麼不朽壞的鋼鐵金石，而僅是一棵嬌弱的植物，必需不斷地用肥料水分去培養，才會結子開花，否則，立刻就會枯乾而死。</p>
<p>他記得：最初幾年，天下太平，做個小學敎師，總還不愁飢寒，因此他的妻子尙能勉强忍受。之後，天下大亂，什麼都變了，他的妻子也就變了。</p>
<p>不過他並不怪她。他知道自已太窮，沒法義活她。他甚至非常感激她。因爲有時候她仍會回來給他一點安慰，倒在他懷裏稱他一聲「可憐的孩子，」然後摸出一疊鈔票塞到他手裏，嬌聲說着：「者你弄得眞像個癟三了，快去買件新長衫吧！」（未完）</p>

<h3>落日</h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>我站在一座荒凉的山頂。微風漸緊。雀鳥漸歸。濃重的雲塊漸漸從東方堆來。一輪疲弱的晚陽，退入了西天的角落，跌下去，暗下去，快沉沒在昏黑的晚霧中了。</p>
<p>「夜來了!」我這樣說着，心中很寗靜。可是刹那間，美麗的迴光出現了：</p>
<p>一個淡紅色的圓球，從西天的角落跳出，放出萬道奇光，飛出金色的火焰，銀色的光圈，紅色的花朶，和紫色的星星。</p>
<p>天空明亮了：雲片飛舞，星星跳躍！</p>
<p>山頭明亮了：樹影婆娑，綠草搖曳!</p>
<p>然而僅一分鐘，迴光去了，一切又重歸寂然。暗的天。黑的山，不知名的小鳥在枝頭低低哀啼。</p>
<p>眞正的夜才開始。</p>
<p>「夜來了！」我又這樣說着，可是我的心在跳。</p>
<p>「夜來了！」我再這樣說着，我的心還是在跳。</p>
<p>「夜終必要來！」一末了我這樣重重地說着，然而我的心，已永不能得到寗靜。</p>
<p>朋友，這就是我要埋怨你的：爲什麼在你咽下最後一口氣的時候，還要放出萬道奇光，還要用顫抖的手指執住了你的朋友們，向他們說：「我愛你們，我忘不了你們！」而不肯燦然而來，悄然而去，讓你的朋友們得到一點寗靜？</p>

<h3>雙宿雙飛（六八）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>輸着麗華上塲了，在沒有上塲之前她站在舞台的門帘口處向台下先眺望了一番，起初，她心裏本能地跳了起來，但很快就鎭定了。她敏捷地用一種「從容就義」的思想，鎭定了自己！她想着：即如遺舞台今天是斷頭台，爲了她的生身之母要她死，她也以好服從！一個人，連「死」都不怕了，還怕什麼呢？她又想着：她到舞台上去唱，唱給那台下的許多人聽；供他們開心；就做她的生身之母，她的師父；叫她學戲，爲他們掙錢；是一個樣的道理。因此，她以後只有拿敷衍她的生身之母，她的師父的心情；再來」敷衍」這台下的許多人。她把登台唱戲也看作了是向這許多人盡義務，正如當初她把學戲看作是向她的生身之母和師父盡「義務」一樣。</p>
<p>於是，應華聽見台上的正德皇帝在叫着「消保」的時候，她在裏面立刻應了聲「來了」，便接着翩翩然姗姗走出。她洒拓地唱着，表演着，她自始至終沒有往台下看一眼，她像置身於無人之境，熟練而精彩地完成了她粉墨生涯的第一頁！</p>
<p>全塲子掌聲雷動，誰都驚異着這是神童下凡！</p>
<p>墨太太，翁二太太，張弦都爲麗華揑了把冷汗！也都開心得發了在！</p>
<p>「怎麼樣？石老板！我沒說錯吧？「瓜瓜叫」的嗓子，「瓜瓜叫」的作工，瞧着啵！不出兩年，準得」掛頭脾」！「掛頭脾」！」張弦驕傲地向石玉樓吹着，一面把麗華抱起來，舉得高高的，有點像對石玉樓示威的神氣。</p>
<p>「這孩子也眞是吃這碗「開口飯」的命，奇怪！爲什麼在台上一點也不怯呢？」石玉樓看着麗華，也很奇異地說。</p>
<p>「沒什麼「奇怪」！還是一句話：張弦的徒弟，沒錯兒！」張弦翹起大拇指說</p>
<p>「興的，都是師父敎的好，才有今天！」墨太太也恭維着張弦。</p>
<p>大家都在爲麗華的成功高興。就是麗華吧，她不但毫不因麗華之比她好而被妬，並且因麗華之散贊賞而驕傲！她眞是一個單純得可愛的孩子。</p>
<p>但只有麗華自已不快活，當她聽見石玉樓給她下了判語：說她「是吃這碗開口飯命」時，她幾乎哭了出來！因爲她想到她將要永遠這樣「盡義務」下去；、永遠這樣給大家「解悶兒」，永遠爲人「掙錢」！然而，她自已得到的是什麼呢？是虛偽的贊賞，是羞辱的榮耀，想到這裏，現在她倒不能鎭定了！她匆匆卸了裝；離開了道人間地獄的後台；回到家裏；不吃東西；也不脫衣服；鑽進被窩裏便嗚嗚咽咽啼不成聲了！她提着自己的小胸口嚷着：「我才十歲，我還要過哆久這樣的日子呢？爸爸！爸爸！你在哪裏？快救救我吧！把我帶到你的世界去！我受不了啦！」她虔誠地祈禱着一種力量來超脫她，但是這力量却不是死了的墨老爺所能給予她的，雖然墨老爺生前很愛地。</p>

<h3>The Three-Man Committee's Deliberations Remain Stalled: General Marshall Proposes a Compromise Plan for Military Reorganization; Negotiations Cannot Continue Without an Agreement; The Crux Lies in the Issue of Demarcation Zones</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 28th] General Marshall visited the Chairman's residence this morning around 9:00 AM to relay to the Chairman the specific opinions of Zhou Enlai regarding General Marshall's proposed counter-plan for military reorganization. He did not leave until 12:30 PM. In the afternoon, Zhou Enlai again went to General Marshall's residence, arriving around 3:30 PM and departing around 7:00 PM. According to sources, the government believes that the three principles proposed by the Chinese Communists in their counter-plan for military reorganization are too vague, lack sincerity, go beyond the scope of military reorganization, do not meet the demands of the nation, and are not suitable for discussion. The Military Three-Man Committee is facing an unprecedented and significant impasse. It is understood that General Marshall is currently drafting a transitional solution to seek agreement from both sides. If no agreement is reached, the situation is not optimistic.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 28th] The Military Three-Man Committee has been stalled due to the vague three principles proposed by the Chinese Communists in their counter-plan for military reorganization. It is said that General Marshall has lost sleep over this matter, but with tireless spirit, he drafted a transitional compromise plan last night in the hope of breaking this deadlock. However, based on observations of various indications after individual discussions today, this plan does not appear to have gained the agreement of both sides. According to qualified observers, General Marshall may revise the military reorganization compromise plan he drafted last night based on the results of his talks with both sides today, in order to make a final effort before 10:00 AM tomorrow. If this transitional solution can reach an agreement, the Military Three-Man Committee will be convened immediately to promptly address the issues of ceasefire in the Northeast, restoration of transportation, General Marshall's power of arbitration, and the reorganization/consolidation/military command, one by one, for a final decision. (Note: Preliminary agreements have been reached on the first three issues, but no signatures have been affixed.) If the transitional solution proposed by General Marshall does not reach an agreement, peace negotiations cannot continue, and the ceasefire deadline cannot be extended. Therefore, the development of the situation is extremely worrying.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 28th] The current stalemate in the military reorganization negotiations between the Nationalists and the Communists lies in the issue of demarcation zones. It is reported that the Chairman, in his meeting with General Marshall, firmly stated that demarcation zones must be implemented to eliminate the source of unrest and reassure the people. The Chinese Communists, on the other hand, firmly oppose demarcation zones, stating that if the Communists agree to withdraw from various points in northern Jiangsu, there must be a fundamental condition: that the economic, political, and legal systems originally established by the Communists in that area must be preserved. The opinions of both sides on this issue are far apart. Therefore, General Marshall has proposed a compromise plan as a transitional solution to break the current deadlock. However, the content of this transitional solution is not yet known. It is rumored that General Marshall will present this plan to the Chairman for discussion tomorrow morning. If both the government and the Chinese Communists can agree, the Three-Man Committee can convene. The final key to peace negotiations will depend on the Chairman's meeting with General Marshall tomorrow.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 28th] It was learned tonight that General Marshall's new military reorganization plan was presented to both the Nationalists and the Communists today.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 28th] Refugees from Chahar Province in Peiping expressed their rejection of General Marshall's proposed compromise plan to designate Chahar Province as a military zone for the Chinese Communists. They sent representatives to the Chairman's headquarters, the Eleventh War Zone Command, and the Military Mediation Department to petition, and today hosted reporters to bitterly describe the suffering of the people of Chahar.</p>
<h3>The Communist's Vague Counter-Proposal Brings a Low-Pressure Atmosphere; Zhang Shenfu and Others from the Third Force Held Talks with Government Representatives Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 28th] This afternoon at 4:30 PM, another meeting unfolded in the quiet red brick bungalow in the garden of Shao Lizi's residence at Number 8 [address]. It is said that this gathering was a meeting invited by Shao Lizi and Dang Shi Xuan for people from the "Third Force." From the government side, there were Zhang Li-sheng and Wang Shi-jie. From the Third Force, there were Zhang Shenfu, Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Huang Yanpei, Liang Shuming, Chen Qitian, Zhang Junmai, and Mo Dehui. The meeting ended at 6:45 PM. Wang Shi-jie abruptly left before the meeting concluded. After the meeting, reporters inquired of Shao about the content of today's meeting. Shao said: Today's meeting was still exchanging opinions, hoping that the peace negotiations could reach some resolution within these remaining two days. Shao's view on the future of peace was answered with the words "there is hope." However, Shao's demeanor in receiving reporters, which had always been very calm in the past, showed signs of anxiety today. The low-pressure atmosphere in Nanjing is entirely due to the three vague principles in the Communist's counter-proposal for military reorganization.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 28th] According to sources from the Third Force, the focus of the talks at Shao's residence today was on hoping that the Communists could make some concessions on military matters, and that the government could make some concessions on political matters. They also hoped that within these last two days, the Northeast portion of the military reorganization plan could be resolved first. It is reported that this Third Force opinion will be conveyed to Chairman Chiang by government representative Wang Shi-jie tonight or tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 28th] The future of China's 470 million people lies behind three mismatched houses: a brown brick house outside the Nanjing commercial district, a heavily guarded residence within the high walls of a military academy, and the air-conditioned, comfortable, and spacious former U.S. Embassy. The first house is where Zhou Enlai lives, the second is where Chairman Chiang lives, and the third is General Marshall's residence. These three houses have become the center of activity in the capital since the beginning of May this year. The activity has now reached its peak, as General Marshall strives to get the Nationalists and Communists to reach an agreement before the end of the Northeast ceasefire agreement on the 30th. General Marshall met with Chairman Chiang for three hours today to discuss the Communist's final military reorganization proposal. Although the content of the talks is not known, it is said that General Marshall used various arguments to bring the Nationalists and Communists closer together. After lunch today, General Marshall met with Zhou Enlai, who heard Chairman Chiang's response to the Communist proposal at General Marshall's residence. According to Communist sources, the Northeast military reorganization issue has gone beyond the issue of troop numbers on each side; this issue has been somewhat resolved. The fundamental issue now is the establishment of each side's sphere of influence. The Communists support a demarcation system, with Communist troops controlling one major city and the government controlling another. Chairman Chiang insists that Communist troops be restricted and concentrated in certain agreed-upon areas, at least until the most recent meeting. Even if a final agreement is reached before the ceasefire deadline, General Marshall's mission will not be completed, and political issues still need to be resolved.</p>
<h3>Mongolian Banner Delegation Arrives in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 28th] The eight-member delegation of Mongolian Banners Celebrating Victory and Returning to the Capital arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. The purpose of this trip is to celebrate victory and return to the capital, respectfully pay tribute to the Head of State, and request central government guidance on how to handle the complex environmental and post-war recovery issues of the Mongolian banners. Furthermore, the Mongolian banner representatives brought Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty's personal battle belt and saber used in his campaign against Galdan, as well as a brocade banner, rug, and leather clothing, intending to present them to Chairman Chiang. They plan to stay in Nanjing for about a month, waiting for all issues to be resolved before returning to the Mongolian region. According to Rong Xiang, the Mongolian Banner Commissioner, they hope to achieve autonomy, but not the independence of Outer Mongolia.</p>
<h3>Communist Army's Cruel Actions: Enticing People to Take Secret Photos, Then Pursuing and Killing Them to Silence Them</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Hankou Office, 28th] A person from Hanchuan reported that Zhao Fangwen and another person, owners of the Shiguang Photography Studio in that county, were lured by the Communist army to Daowen Lake to take secret photos for half a month. Just as they were about to be sent back, the Communist army, to silence them, sent personnel to kill the studio owners en route and dump their bodies in the lake. Several days later, fishermen discovered the bodies, which were rotten and a gruesome sight.</p>
<h3>Students of Northeast Provisional University Prick Their Fingers to Write Letter to the Chairman, Bitterly Denouncing Current Evils and Listing Entire Suggestions; Chairman's Reply Praises and Encourages Students, Who Are Extremely Excited</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Fanyang Office, 28th] During Chairman Chiang's last visit to the Northeast, all the students of the Northeast Provisional University sent 17 representatives to present a blood letter to the Chairman on May 30th, containing more than 50 clauses, bitterly denouncing the current evils. They listed comprehensive suggestions for the construction and restoration of politics, economy, and education in the Northeast. The Chairman at the time added encouragement and took the blood letter to Nanjing for detailed review. Yesterday, a reply from Chairman Chiang was received. It is understood that the letter stated briefly: "Your loyalty and love for the country, and the purity of your aspirations, are deeply moving by pricking your fingers to write a letter. The various points you have presented are insightful and should be taken into consideration for review. In the future, if you have any opinions, you can express them to the best of your ability," and so on. It is said that the students and general youth of the university were greatly excited after receiving the letter, and deeply hope that the various points presented can be implemented in reality.</p>
<h3>Changchun Military Mediation Detachment Decides to Send More Groups to Northeast; Will Depart as Soon as Both Sides Agree</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Peiping Office, 28th] Good news of peace must wait until the end of the month to be revealed, but the American people who long for peace in China are already carrying out their good peace preparation work at the Changchun Military Mediation Detachment. After Barber arrived in Changchun, he had specific suggestions for the location of the additional groups in the Northeast: the 33rd Group would be stationed in Jiamusi, the 34th Group in Lafa, and the 35th Group in Harbin. They will depart as soon as the government and the Communists agree. The Northeast has been generally peaceful recently, but small conflicts continue to occur. According to a telegram from Du Weiming: (A) At 3:00 PM on the 18th, the garrison troops in the Sanjialing Jinkeng area, five kilometers west of Xiaoshi, were suddenly surrounded and attacked by more than 3,000 troops from the 3rd and 5th Brigades of the Communist army. Our troops were forced to withdraw to the line of Daxiling, Xiaobaigou, and Niuxintai. (All are east of Benxihu) (B) On the morning of the 20th, the Communist army entrenched in Niuxintai (about 15 kilometers southeast of Liaoyang) suddenly shelled our positions on Chongjia Mountain with more than 20 shells. (C) The railway bridges and utility poles near Yiqi Mu (about 15 kilometers east of Yingpan) have been destroyed by the Communist army in recent days. (D) According to a person from Andong, the Communist army is gathering four brigades of troops, preparing to attack Haicheng and Dashiqiao.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Fanyang Office, 27th] Cai Wenzhi, Chief of Staff of the Military Mediation Department, summoned Cai Zonglian, the leader of the 27th Group, and Wang Tianren, the leader of the 29th Group, on the morning of the 27th to give instructions. On the 28th, he will fly to Changchun with He Yingqin, and is scheduled to stay in Changchun for one day, to summon the small groups in Changchun. He will fly back to Peiping with He on the 29th. Furthermore, Cai Zonglian of the 27th Group will lead his members by train to Changchun on the 28th. General Sun Liren, commander of the New First Army, came to Shenyang from the defense zone on the 27th to pay respects to the authorities, report, and request instructions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 28th] Major General Cai Zonglian, the government leader of the 27th Group of the Military Mediation Department, was ordered to be transferred to serve as the government director of the Changchun Branch of the department. He will go to Changchun by special train on the 28th to take office. The vacancy left by the leader of the 27th Group will be filled by Colonel Dong Chenglie.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 28th] Communist representative Rao Shushi left Changchun by plane for Peiping today.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Peiping Office, 28th] Shi Zhiren, Director of the Peiping-Tianjin Railway Bureau, returned to Peiping today after participating in the restoration of transportation negotiations in Nanjing. He immediately convened a meeting to discuss technical issues related to repairing the railways. It is understood that as soon as the agreement to restore transportation is signed, work will begin immediately to repair the Tianjin-Pukou and Jiaoji Railways, which can be completed within three months. However, the sleepers prepared earlier are no longer sufficient due to the construction of pontoon bridges after the destruction of various bridges in recent months.</p>
<h3>Hill and Other Representatives from Three Parties to Inspect Tianjin-Pukou Railway Lines</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Peiping Office, 28th] Zhang Liushi, the government representative of the Executive Headquarters Transportation Department, Huang Yiqun, the Chinese Communist representative, and Hill, the American representative, will fly to the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, Jiaoji Railway, and the eastern section of the Longhai Railway for inspection within days. According to responsible sources, the Nanjing Three-Man Committee has reached an agreement on the restoration of transportation. Once the military reorganization is negotiated, it can be signed together. Their trip is to provide spiritual encouragement to the various transportation groups and to convey the content and spirit of the transportation restoration agreement to the local military so that the railway repair work in various places can be smoothly launched once the agreement is signed. Of the three railways that the Three-Man Committee decided to repair first, the Jiaoji Railway and the Longhai Railway have already been partially opened to traffic, only waiting for the connecting project, except that the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has been damaged too much and the repair will take a long time. Also, the 15th Group of the Executive Headquarters' Mediation Department, which is in charge of handling the Jiaodong disputes, flew from Peiping to Qingdao today.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 28th] Since the beginning of the month, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and Jiaoji Railway have been repeatedly sabotaged by the Communist army.

<h3>He Yingqin Flies to Changchun, Meets with Reporters and Expresses His Feelings Upon Arriving in Changchun; May Leave Changchun and Return to Peiping Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 28th] General He Yingqin flew from Shenyang to Changchun by special plane at 11:10 AM on the 28th. Those who came with him included Vice Minister Li Weiguo, Chief of Staff Cai Wenzhi, Chief of Staff Zhao Jiaji, Pan Gongbi, and Wang Ruo. Deputy Commander Zheng Dongguo, Chairman of the Concurrent Post Liang Huasheng, and Commander Liao Yaoxiang all welcomed him at the airport. He received flowers after getting off the plane, reviewed the honor guard, and then drove directly to the former South Manchuria Railway President's residence in the city to rest. On the main street through the city, the welcoming line stretched for several miles, with constant cheering. He will visit various places this afternoon and may leave Changchun on the 29th to return to Peiping.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 28th] He Yingqin inspected the scenic spots and major buildings here at 4:00 PM this afternoon, accompanied by Zheng Dongguo, Liang Huasheng, Liao Yaoxiang, Shang Chuandao, and others. He did not return to the former South Manchuria Railway President's residence until 7:30 PM. In the evening, Zheng Dongguo hosted a banquet to welcome him, and the film of Wang Jingwei's visit to the Northeast was shown to add to the fun.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 28th] He Yingqin met with reporters from various newspapers and news agencies at the former South Manchuria Railway President's residence at 12:15 PM today. He said that before going to the United States as the head of the Chinese military delegation to attend the Military Staff Committee of the United Nations Security Council, he took time to travel and inspect various places. The trip to Changchun was his first in his life, so when the plane flew over Changchun, he felt extremely excited. The Northeast is the lifeline of China. The people of the Northeast spent 14 years in a life of servitude, exchanging blood and sweat for some construction, but unexpectedly it is now in a state of irreparable destruction. Thinking of this, he deeply hopes that the Communist Party members will keep the nation and the people in mind and not recklessly destroy it, so that the nation's vitality can be preserved. The issue that the people of the country are concerned about is peace, unification, and unity, but this depends on the Communist Party being sincere and implementing the established resolutions, such as unified reorganization of military issues. Then, other political issues will be easily resolved.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Peiping Office, 28th] A person from the Northeast today said that He Yingqin's sudden arrival in the Northeast amidst rumors of the reorganization of the Northeast Headquarters has attracted much attention. Changchun has a saying that General He will succeed Xiong in presiding over the Northeast, but this saying has not been confirmed by the most reliable sources.</p>

<h3>The Enemy Property Handling Bureau Auctions Materials; Total Value May Reach 500 Billion; The Nanjing Office Auctioned Four Times, Obtaining 1 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 28th] Since the Enemy and Puppet Industry Handling Bureau's Nanjing office began sorting out enemy and puppet materials last month, it has auctioned four batches, totaling just under 1 billion yuan. According to a spokesman for the office, the auction of enemy and puppet materials is entrusted to the Central Trust Bureau. However, for the sake of rationality and caution, the Audit Department, the Trust Bureau, and the office send personnel to estimate the price within the one-week bidding period. The principle is to set a minimum price based on the market price, minus the merchant's transportation costs, legal profits, and material depreciation. By the deadline for bidding, the three parties will jointly determine an average reserve price. The bidder who is closest to this reserve price will be qualified, so that malfeasance can be prevented. It is hoped that the materials currently kept by military agencies will be quickly handed over, and the Supervisory Yuan and the Provisional Senate are already negotiating separately.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 28th] The newly appointed Mayor of Guangzhou, Ouyang Ju, and his party arrived here by plane from Nanjing at around 4:00 p.m. on the 27th and stayed at the Victory Building. In an interview with our reporter, he said: "General Chen Ce repeatedly and firmly declined due to excessive fatigue.

The date of taking office will be determined after consulting with various superiors and discussing with Mayor Chen, possibly on July 1st. Future municipal facilities will be reformed after taking office and observing the situation." He also said: "Our eight years of War of Resistance resulted in enormous losses.

In the future, I will, based on my past spirit of responsibility as the police chief here, gradually find ways to overcome all difficulties. I hope that the media will provide frank criticism and guidance so that there can be improvements." It is understood that Ouyang Ju was originally a Central Committee member and lieutenant general and deputy commander of the Gan-Yue-Min border region.

<h3>"Clumsy Tactics"</h3>
<p>Editorial in the English-Language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post"</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special Translation] The English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post" published an editorial on the 27th entitled "Clumsy Tactics," attacking the remarks made to foreign reporters by Tao Xingzhi, a spokesman for the self-proclaimed Shanghai People's United Association, and denouncing the Communist Party's anti-American movement.</p>
<p>The gist of the editorial said: "For a man who claims to be seeking peace, Dr. Tao Xingzhi seems to be preparing to cause trouble. In addition, he seems to have a 'dead man doesn't care' irresponsible spirit."</p>
<p>Dr. Tao invited news reporters to address the incident in Nanjing, where ten "peace representatives" were beaten, declaring that the actions of these people who did not comply with the government's will were very boring!</p>
<p>In our view, Dr. Tao has darkened the entire scene of his "civil war problem" after admitting that the anti-American slogans were the work of his faction. These slogans have caused many inflammatory results, as evidenced by the unpleasant incidents involving Americans.</p>
<p>Dr. Tao's excuse is: "The longer the American troops stay in China, the more trouble will be caused." Let's be clear: At a time when the situation is becoming increasingly delicate, opinions are divided among Americans (including military officials and civilians) on whether American troops should remain in China. But some facts are very clear: the arrival of American troops in China was not to promote imperialism, but to defeat Japan. On the latter point, they have done it, and have liberated a nation from bondage, but some people are trying to make people forget this fact and turn to the seductive red page.</p>
<p>We are an American newspaper, so are we inevitably biased? Undoubtedly, because we are the ones being attacked now, so we can frankly admit that we feel very indignant. All those who are not emotional must agree: launching an anti-American movement at this time is by no means something that any responsible Chinese group or individual should do. Should the United States receive the retribution of an anti-American movement? Does the American loan to China, technical assistance to China, etc., not leave any impression on the Chinese people?</p>
<p>We can answer our own questions: There are many people in China who are more stable and conscientious than Dr. Tao.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that the purpose of Dr. Tao and his party's anti-American movement is simply to cause trouble and then take advantage of it. We believe that his tactics will gain nothing, and the only beneficiaries will be the disgruntled elements."</p>
<h3>Editorial: We Don't Want Fighting, But Even More, We Must Not Allow Delay!</h3>
<p>Regarding the current situation in China, we have a very simple view: We don't want fighting, but even more, we must not allow delay! Fighting brings pain, but the pain of delay is even greater! Fighting is dangerous, but the dangers of delay can exhaust the nation and its people, leading to irreversible ruin!</p>
<p>Today's events in China are truly causing headaches and mental fatigue. The Chinese people, caught in the entanglement of the government and the Communist Party fighting and negotiating, negotiating and fighting, cannot die even if they wish, and cannot live well even if they want to. Since the victory [of the Second World War], China's economy has suffered due to instability. Damaged transportation has led to the abnormal conditions of high prices and high wages, and the situation is deteriorating, nearing collapse. China's opportunities since the victory against Japan were unprecedented; it should have been a golden age for the Chinese people to strive for national reconstruction. Instead, warmongers have created civil war, dragging on for ten months. The golden age is swiftly vanishing; not only is the opportunity lost and unrecoverable, but the nation is on the verge of sinking into an abyss from which it cannot escape. This is the fault of "fighting," but even more so, it is the sin of "delay!"</p>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party should certainly bear the blame for this "delay," but the National Government cannot shirk its responsibility either. The Chinese people have long understood the Communist Party quite well, and while they may have a "desire to be kind to others," they do not place much hope in it. However, the Chinese people always believed that the National Government, which led the war of resistance, should strive to stabilize the overall situation and lead national reconstruction. The National Government is indeed legally and practically obligated to do so. Why has the government been indecisive, procrastinating, sometimes fighting, sometimes negotiating, negotiating and then fighting, fighting and then negotiating, delaying again and again for as long as ten months? Ten months have passed! A pregnant woman would have given birth, a baby would be cooing on the ground, but we still haven't achieved "peace" through open and honest communication. Ten months have passed! The people's situation is worsening, like water deepening or fire intensifying. What are we talking about "escaping from water and fire and ascending to a comfortable seat"? We must criticize the leaders; the National Government should bear the responsibility for "delaying" and harming the country over these ten months. Tomorrow is the last day of the eight-day extension of the ceasefire. We would like to remind the government and advise the Communist Party that if a solution is to be found, it must be found within these next two days, and absolutely no further delay should be allowed.</p>
<p>Speaking of the ceasefire negotiations, it truly makes us sad and indignant! Ceasefire orders are issued and reissued, and deadlines are extended again and again. But with only one day left in the extended deadline, what has the Three-Man Committee achieved in its repeated negotiations? Marshal Ma was still busy drafting a plan yesterday, but the Communist Party still refuses to accept it. To say there is a ceasefire is doubtful! Moreover, the Communist Party in Shanxi is intensifying its siege of Datong; in Shandong, it is attacking Weixian; and in the Northeast, Lin Biao is hosting reporters, exaggerating his preparations for launching a large-scale field battle. A chorus of killing sounds seems to be growing louder. Where is the "ceasefire"? Speaking of restoring transportation, we only hear the sound of footsteps on the stairs, but no one comes down. Mr. Yu Dawei and Mr. Zhou Enlai are busy as can be, but where has permission been granted for road repair crews to repair the roads? When will the Tianjin-Pukou Railway be open? When will the Pinghan Railway be usable? Heaven knows, it's still just empty talk and castles in the air! Speaking of reorganizing and unifying the armies, it was clearly stipulated long ago that the National Army would have 50 divisions and the Communist Army would have 10 divisions. All three parties agreed, but now they all demand changes. This is equivalent to saying that words and signatures are completely meaningless. As for the issue of defense zones, sometimes they refuse to cede the provinces and cities they have occupied, sometimes they advocate using villages as their base, and sometimes they demand that troops be stationed together in cities. In short, with a thousand words and ten thousand phrases, they never get to the main point of reorganization and reduction, and everyone is at a loss. If negotiations continue like this, not to mention that there is only one day left, even if they are extended for another ten days, a hundred days, or even indefinitely, it will still be a stalemate.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking: we hope that both sides negotiate, and hope that both sides negotiate sincerely, and that they must negotiate a conclusion and achieve peace. However, we absolutely oppose the insincere negotiations of the past, the negotiations that are outwardly united but inwardly divided, the negotiations that are haggling and petty like merchants. We especially do not want to see the "negotiations" used as a pretext to cover up "fighting." Furthermore, we sincerely long for peace, but if "peace" is ultimately something that can be hoped for but not attained, then between "fighting" and "delay," we, in despair, have no choice but to seek the lesser of two evils, preferring "fighting" to "delay." This is not to say that we advocate fighting. On the contrary, we firmly say "Do not fight!" But if we do not fight, then we must achieve "peace" quickly and decisively. If we neither fight nor make peace, but both fight and make peace, and continue down the path of "delay," then it is simply to bury the country and kill the people!</p>
<p>Peace, peace! Everyone yearns for it day and night, but "peace" is only our goal. We want a peaceful and stable China. How to achieve peace depends entirely on the method. For example, if a person suffers from a toxic and malignant sore that breaks out all over their body, curing it is just the goal, and how to treat it is the method. Applying medicine, taking medicine, getting injections, having surgery: which one is effective depends on the circumstances. There is no reason to force someone to only apply medicine or take medicine, and not allow injections or surgery. Today in China, we want peace, absolutely want peace. But negotiate? Fight? These are all methods, and "delay" is not a method, absolutely unacceptable. If we can negotiate, then negotiate, and if we negotiate well, then we will make peace. When negotiations are impossible, unnecessary, or ultimately ineffective, we would rather endure the pain of "fighting" for a while than "delay." Because fighting may not kill us, but delay will surely kill us! Taking medicine and then wanting surgery, starting surgery halfway and then wanting to apply medicine, continuing down this path of losing our minds and being at a loss will likely end with the patient being delayed to death! The current situation in China, unfortunately, seems to be heading down this dead end, and this dead end of delay must not be taken again!</p>
<p>Here, we must make it even clearer: Regarding peace and fighting, we unconditionally and one hundred percent hope for peace. However, if peace is impossible and only fighting and delay remain, we unconditionally and one hundred percent oppose further delay. Only in this way, when there is a glimmer of hope for peace, do we, the people, demand that the government and the Communist Party sincerely seek peace; but when peace is truly hopeless, we must not avoid treatment and prevent doctors from performing surgery quickly and decisively. The reason why refugees from northern Jiangsu and southern Shandong are shouting "Fight back to our old homes!" is probably a manifestation of this impatience.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a seemingly true but actually false saying these days: "Fighting cannot bring about democracy." Then can delay bring about democracy? We believe that weapons are ominous, war is dangerous. The benevolent use their minds to stop war. We should not resort to arms unless absolutely necessary. But saying that democracy can never be achieved through fighting is not necessarily the truth. The American Civil War is also called a "civil war" by historians. President Lincoln started the "civil war" in order to free slaves. Fighting did occur, but the foundation of American democracy became more solid. At that time, we never heard the call of "anti-civil war." And how could fighting not bring about democracy? The First World War defeated Wilhelm II and created the Soviet Union. The Soviet Communist Party also fought a major "civil war" with the White Russians. After all, fighting did occur, and it brought about a "new type" of democratic country in the world—the Soviet Union. This World War defeated the three fascist bandits of Germany, Japan, and Italy, and only then was the survival of democratic countries free from threats. Fighting did occur, and the future democratic systems of Germany, Japan, and Italy will be nurtured from this. From these examples, we can prove that fighting may sometimes bring about democracy, but delay has no such hope. Therefore, our first hope is that peace can be achieved without fighting, and we must always try our best not to fight. But not fighting and not making peace, but only delaying, will ultimately plunge the country and its people into a dangerous situation, and that is a crime for thousands of generations!</p>
<h3>Local Correspondence: Wu County Telegraph Bureau Hosts Reporters, Explains Business Difficulties</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Correspondent] The Wu County Telegraph Bureau has been in operation for ten months since its takeover. Although various businesses have been actively reorganized, the prospects for business development are limited by technical, mechanical equipment, and economic problems, which are indeed difficult to overcome. As a result, users often feel inconvenience. In order to make the outside world understand the actual situation, the bureau specially invited reporters from local and foreign newspapers to a tea party at about 3:00 pm on the 26th. First, Director Chen Tianzuo reported on the history, equipment, business overview, and future plans of the bureau, briefly stating: Although the Suzhou bureau has more than 2,500 telephones, less than 2,000 are available for use. Currently, telegrams can be directly transmitted to Shanghai, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Changshu, Kunshan, Jiaxing, Wujin, Wuxing, Wujiang, Shengze, and other places. The recent business plan is to widely install public telephones, install rural telephones, increase long-distance telephone lines, and repair telephones. Due to the shortage of mechanical equipment, many difficulties are expected. However, the bureau is determined to make every effort. Chen also particularly emphasized the depletion of funds. Each telephone costs an average of more than 10,000 yuan, while the rent collected is only 1,500 yuan. According to the Suzhou bureau's minimum expenditure, it loses more than 13 million yuan per month. The total loss on the Jinghu line is estimated to be 500 million yuan, which is a major obstacle to the development of the telecommunications business. He appealed to the press for deep sympathy. After Chen's speech, he earnestly requested the attendees to express their opinions, and in response to the request of Wu Shouren, a reporter from our newspaper stationed in Suzhou, he agreed to make every effort to quickly connect the news telephone between Suzhou and Shanghai in the future. Finally, he led them to visit the bureau's various equipment rooms, and the gathering photographed at around 6:00 pm before dispersing.</p>
<h3>Reduced Military Grain Purchase Price: Telegram to the Province Urges Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Taicang Correspondent] The Taicang County Temporary Assembly, County Party Department, Youth League, and others, because County Magistrate Shen Yuanming recently set a deadline for the requisition of 10,784 dan of military grain, which is too large a difference from the 856 dan that the provincial capital verified should be continued to be paid by this county, and Shen County Magistrate's purchase price is not the 13,000 yuan per dan after the provincial government increased the price, but only paid a purchase price of 5,000 yuan per dan, which caused public outrage. Various social organizations and agencies have jointly telegraphed the provincial government, appealing to send personnel to thoroughly investigate.</p>

<h3>Son Arrests Father's Murderer</h3>
<p>Shen Sanfu of Liu Xia Township, Qingpu, in June of the thirty-second year [of the Republic, i.e., 1943], was extorted for ten dan of white rice by Chen Guanlin, the pseudo-chief of the pseudo-first bao of the township, in collusion with the pseudo-chief of the township and the pseudo-chief of the pseudo-third bao. On the evening of the 11th of the same month, the pseudo-chief of the third bao guided six armed bandits, who abducted Shen, beat him with hoes, etc., and buried him alive. Sanfu's son, Zuxiu, heard the news and wanted to avenge his father's grievances, but because the evil forces were rampant, he had to endure it and live in hiding in Sijing. It was not until April 5 of this year that Zuxiu encountered his father's enemy, Chen Guanlin, in the town and handed Chen over to the police station. The station transferred Chen Guanlin to the Songjiang County Police Bureau for detention. It is learned that Shen Zuxiu has requested the county government to punish him, and the County Party Department and the People's Freedom Protection Committee have also sent letters to the county government, requesting that the case be handled impartially and strictly.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Province Conducts Comprehensive Elimination of Bandits</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Security Command, in order to thoroughly eliminate bandits and ensure local security, has instructed all districts and counties to conduct a comprehensive elimination. The counties under the second district of Shaoxing have already actively prepared and started the elimination work. It is learned that Lanxi has also begun to organize elimination agencies. Because the five townships of Haolu, Dayuan, Boshe, Majian, and Shiqu in the northern district of the county have been occupied for a long time and the situation is special, County Magistrate Fan personally led two detachments of the Self-Defense Force and a team of detectives with 20 police officers to preside over the elimination work. The office is located in Majian, and the elimination work is scheduled to be completed by the 30th of next month.</p>

<h3>Four Foreign Ministers Make Greatest Efforts, Discuss Peace Treaty Draft Comprehensively, Remove Obstacles so that Peace Conference Can be Convened as Scheduled. Current Deadlock Still Lies in the Sovereignty Issue of Trieste Port</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] London, 28th Broadcast: The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference is deadlocked over the Trieste port issue. At today's meeting, the four foreign ministers made their greatest efforts to sign agreements on Italy and the Balkan countries in an attempt to break the deadlock, but the results are unknown.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 28th] The four foreign ministers continued their meeting today, making last-minute efforts to comprehensively discuss the peace treaties with Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Finland, in order to clear obstacles so that the 21-nation peace conference can be held in Paris in July. The four foreign ministers were quite encouraged after resolving the Dodecanese Islands and Franco-Italian border issues yesterday. Each sub-minister submitted a draft of the peace treaties with the five countries, which were discussed at today's meeting. It is generally believed that the Trieste port issue is still the key to resolving all issues. There are many fundamental issues among the issues, such as reparations, colonies, and the distribution of remaining warships. The main issues of the peace treaties with the Balkan countries are related to the freedom of navigation on the Danube River and the freedom of trade with those countries. There are no fundamental differences of opinion on the Finnish peace treaty. According to British sources, although the four foreign ministers had a fruitful meeting yesterday, there is still doubt as to whether they can fulfill their self-set deadline of today to complete the work on the peace treaties with the five countries. It is also very doubtful whether the peace conference can be convened on July 15th.</p>
<h3>Achieved Several Agreements: Dodecanese Islands Returned to Greece, Revision of Franco-Italian Border, Restriction of Bulgarian Navy, Disposition of Romanian Foreign Funds</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 27th] The four foreign ministers decided this afternoon to return the Dodecanese Islands to Greece, accept France's claim to revise the Franco-Italian border, and agree on measures to restrict the Bulgarian navy and dispose of Romanian foreign funds. Near the end of this afternoon's meeting, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov stated that he had completed his research on the Dodecanese Islands issue and was prepared to agree to return the islands to Greece, subject to the condition that the islands must be designated as a demilitarized zone. This condition was unanimously approved on the spot. The Foreign Ministers' Conference is scheduled to continue at 4:00 pm tomorrow to discuss the Balkan treaties and other unresolved issues. Regarding the Franco-Italian border issue, France requested to acquire the Cenis Plateau and the areas of Tenda and Briga. Molotov indicated that he could accept this proposal, but Italians must be allowed to share the hydroelectric power plants in the Tenda and Briga areas. US Secretary of State Byrnes said that this was the consistent position of the United States, and the issue was successfully and fully agreed upon. Regarding the Bulgarian Navy, it was limited to 7,250 tons and the naval personnel must not exceed 3,100. Regarding the free navigation of the Danube River, the restoration of United Nations property in Romania, and the two articles related to aviation in the Romanian treaty, no final agreement has yet been reached.</p>
<p>Note: The Dodecanese Islands consist of 13 small islands, originally belonging to Turkey, and occupied by Italy in 1911. The population is 40,000, mostly Greek fishermen. During the war, the Soviet Union requested to establish naval and air bases on the islands.</p>

<h3>The Zigzags of American Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent in America, Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>New York, June 7th Dispatch The New York Sun published a provocative cartoon on the last day of May. A group of rowdy children were fighting in a circle, making a complete mess, while two leisurely onlookers stood outside the circle. The word "Democratic Party" was written inside the circle, and "Republican Party" was written on the backs of the onlookers. The cartoon's caption ended with a question mark: "Is this a small-scale civil war?"</p>
<p>Democratic Diplomacy at a Crossroads</p>
<p>That day was the day Stettinius resigned from his position as Secretary of State to President Truman, and it was also two days after the President's "anti-strike bill" was disastrously defeated in Congress. Stettinius was unwilling to serve as the U.S. representative to the Security Council because of disagreements with Truman and Byrnes' policies. Although the focus of the disagreement was not explicitly stated, there were faint clues to be found. A week before the announcement of Stettinius' resignation, a reporter from the New York Herald Tribune said that the UN Security Council had quite different opinions on the discussion of the Iranian case. He also said, "Mr. Stettinius seems to believe that the Iranian case has developed to a point where it is permissible to grant the Soviet request to withdraw it from the agenda." But the reporter said in the final paragraph: "The U.S. position is to continue the discussion unless the Soviet pressure on Iran's internal affairs is completely removed." Stettinius, as the U.S. representative, had different opinions from the U.S. government's diplomatic decisions. Sure enough, four or five days later, the news of Stettinius' resignation was announced. I believe that Stettinius' resignation is merely a symbol of American Democratic diplomacy entering a crossroads. Today, America has an abundance of talent, and finding a replacement to sit on the Security Council and play the "gramophone" is not a big deal. The crux of the matter is: how should the Democratic Party grasp this crucial point of diplomatic tension in the future?</p>
<p>Munich the Second</p>
<p>Secretary of State Byrnes went to Paris for a meeting of the four foreign ministers and returned in a hurry. The two diplomatic stalwarts who went with him, Vandenberg and Connally, cooperated with Byrnes to an unprecedented degree this time. After returning, they praised Byrnes' firmness and decisiveness. Vandenberg made a long-distance call to a reporter from the New York Herald Tribune one night in Paris. The Herald Tribune originally had historical ties with the Republican Party, and it naturally recorded the words of the first-class stalwarts in the Republican Party in great detail, fearing nothing was left out. Every sentence and every word of the question-and-answer session of the long-distance phone interview was recorded. The central meaning of that long-distance telephone interview was that Mr. Vandenberg saw what he called "Munich" in Paris. He said: This is really another "Munich," and there is nothing more to discuss in meetings. He said: Meetings are supposed to be about mutual debate, but in Paris, results will only come if the U.S. makes concessions to the Soviet Union step by step. "Molotov's opinion is the Bible, and we have no right to modify it"?</p>
<p>However, Vandenberg laughed on the phone, "In the era of Munich, there was still a Chamberlain with an umbrella, covered in dust, but today, there is no such good person." He told the reporter from the Herald Tribune: "I am going back to Washington immediately, there is nothing more to discuss!" In fact, Vandenberg, Connally, and Byrnes returned to Washington five days later than scheduled in the phone call. Although there was no Chamberlain at the Paris conference, Byrnes and the others had the same desire for understanding as Chamberlain.</p>
<p>Is World War III Inevitable?</p>
<p>The Paris Conference was a turning point in the Democratic Party's postwar diplomacy. The tragic and ruthless failure of the Paris Conference forced the Truman administration to make plans for the second step after Munich. Vandenberg's phone call did not mention the word "war." The Herald Tribune reporter asked him: "If the meeting is fruitless, if the world situation deteriorates further, what should be done?" Vandenberg just laughed and said, "I don't know." But Byrnes' broadcast after flying back to Washington was very clear. He said: "If the Soviet Union does not intend to seek peace, then World War III is almost inevitable." A foreign minister leading a country made such a serious public statement. We cannot judge its weight with ordinary eyes! Under such a major turning point in decision-making, I dare not say that the United States will immediately step into war, but during the two years of the Truman administration's term, every bit of the United States will move toward this big principle. The large-scale expansion of military bases, Iceland, Atlantic islands, the Caspian Sea, and U.S. base negotiations are unfolding simultaneously in many countries. The British loan of 3.75 billion dollars has been passed, and the exchange condition is that the United States has free use of British bases in the Pacific. The French loan of 1.25 billion dollars has also been passed. The old man, Léon Blum, in his seventies, rushed to the United States at the cost of his life. The loan was successful, and Léon Blum also flew back to France. The possible result is that the power of the French Socialist Party will greatly expand, and the previously ambiguous French attitude is also gradually becoming clear. The Gouin cabinet stated that Franco-American relations would be more friendly. In the Security Council, the French representative with the thin face, who previously specialized in bumping into nails with the United States and often ridiculed the Chinese representative, will obediently raise his hand for the United States in the future. Dollar diplomacy is one of the most realistic means in reality, but in any case, it has its authority in today's world.</p>
<p>"Dollar Diplomacy" and Loans to the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Admiral Leahy, now the President's military advisor, also suddenly flew to England. The mission was not announced. A New York newspaper said: Leahy's mission is to arrange military cooperation between the United Kingdom and the United States. Moscow Radio discovered this, and these days, it is desperately broadcasting, attacking the U.S. base policy. However, the Soviets do not understand that the base policy relies on "dollar diplomacy" for support. Isn't it difficult for the propagandists in Moscow to criticize "dollar diplomacy" in greater depth!</p>
<p>The crux of the matter is this: Before the large loan proposed by Moscow is 100% hopeless, the Soviet Union is willing to write a short period of silence. I have not explored the details of the loan in detail, but I know that loans have already been approved for Belgium, France, and the United Kingdom, and loans have not been approved for China, Poland, and the Soviet Union. The Chinese loan has been authorized to General Marshall by Congress, and the issue is relatively simple. Opinions were once exchanged on the Polish loan, and it was believed that under the current situation in Poland, it was necessary to discuss the loan with French businessmen. The congressmen said: "Our requirements are very simple, at a minimum, we must be able to fully open up freedom of the press in Poland before we can negotiate the loan." Poland's freedom of the press must be consulted with another country, so the case was shelved. It seems that the Soviet loan has not yet been discussed, and the case has not been mentioned in Congress at all. When I was in Washington, I listened to reporters and congressmen chatting in the congressional lounge. One congressman said something that I thought was very insightful and easy to understand. He curled his fingers and said: "Americans are now uneasy about the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union does not trust the United States. It is not easy for the Soviet Union to trust the United States, but for the United States to trust the Soviet Union, it only takes three things: First, American journalists must be allowed to report news from anywhere in the Soviet Union, which is the so-called freedom of news exchange. Second, the two countries should send military advisory groups to each other to supervise that no preparations for war are being made. Third, the two countries must exchange students. Unfortunately, these three things cannot be done now. Every country in the world has students studying in the United States, but the Soviet Union is the only one that is missing.

<h3>Chain-Style Veto Usage: Soviet Representative Makes Unreasonable Trouble; Security Council Rules Must Be Revised; Iran-Iraq Issue to be Submitted to General Assembly for Discussion</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 27th] Multiple members of the UN Security Council recently stated that, in light of the Soviet Union's use of its veto power to oppose the majority's resolutions, the veto rules of the Security Council must be revised. For example, last night's discussion of the Franco problem in Spain lasted six hours, and Soviet representative Gromyko used the veto twice to overturn the majority's resolution. If not revised, the faith of nations entrusting the Council to handle international peace and security issues will be lost.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 27th] Soviet representative Gromyko yesterday used his veto power in a chain-like fashion in the Security Council. Australian representative Evatt denounced it as a kind of "slanderous" action.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 28th] Since Soviet representative Gromyko proposed three veto methods during the Security Council's discussion of the Spanish problem, it is rumored that Britain and the United States are now planning to remove the complex Spanish and Iranian problems from the Security Council and submit them to the UN General Assembly to be convened in September. The UN General Assembly has no great power veto, but according to the Security Council's rules of procedure, the above two cases can be revoked by a procedural vote of seven countries. Therefore, the technology of removing the two cases from the Security Council agenda will become extremely important. At the same time, it is learned that Australian representative Evatt will continue to strive to abolish the veto power of the five powers at the September General Assembly, or at least limit the veto power.</p>
<h3>Atomic Energy Commission</h3>
<p>Discusses Procedural Issues; Refuses Press Attendance</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 28th] The Soviet representative to the UN Atomic Energy Commission notified the commission today that the passage of any bill must be approved by a two-thirds vote of the representatives. The Atomic Energy Commission held its first executive committee meeting today and began discussing permanent methods for managing atomic energy. However, due to the Soviet representative's notification, the voting issue will be discussed at the meeting. UN Security Council rules of procedure experts yesterday passed a provision that any measure can be implemented as long as it is approved by a majority of the twelve representatives of the commission. Soviet rules of procedure experts disagreed, declared a reservation, and also raised this issue to the committee today. Today's meeting was mostly about procedural issues, so reporters were not allowed to attend.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Accuses U.S. of Holding Atomic Secrets</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 27th] Soviet Radio commentator Osipov, broadcast in Moscow today, reiterating the Soviet Union's opposition to the atomic energy management plan proposed by U.S. representative Baruch, and said that the United States wants to consolidate its atomic energy patent rights in order to dominate the world. Osipov declared that the era of deciding international issues without the Soviet Union has passed. Stubborn elements have lost everything because of their blind hatred of democracy, and should remember this lesson. The Soviet Union's atomic energy management plan is the result of unwavering efforts to strive for international peace and amity.</p>
<h3>Fourth Atomic Bomb: Imminent Deployment; White Rats and Goats Serve as Test Subjects; Blandy Speculates on Post-Bombing Results</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Atomic Bomb Test Reporter, Ship Apalachin, 27th] The preparations for the U.S. Army and Navy's atomic bomb test, as of now, can be said to have failed in terms of news reporting. Unless telecommunications can be greatly improved in the next few days, reporters are afraid that the explosion of the world's fourth atomic bomb will be equivalent to a solo performance by radio, and newspapers will not be able to publish it in time. None of the reporters on the Apalachin can fully explain the reason for the telecommunications delays. According to telecommunications managers, the ship's various signals are very strong, but Pearl Harbor and San Francisco cannot receive them properly. No photos have been obtained from the initial tests, and photographers at Bikini Atoll have been restricted by the Safety Council's regulations. At the same time, extensive radio programs have also been prepared to report the bombing situation. News ships have difficulty contacting the mainland, so news of Monday's preliminary exercises only reached the United States six hours later. American scientists believe that if the first atomic bomb test is postponed to the third week of August due to bad weather, then there will be no test this year, because the typhoon season is approaching. As for whether the explosion of the atomic bomb will cause a typhoon, this question cannot be answered, but reliable meteorologists do not think so. Even if a typhoon occurs, it will not endanger atomic test ships and personnel, because the typhoon is not violent when it first starts. This kind of typhoon will also not endanger the U.S. coast, because the wind moves towards the Philippines and remains unchanged, and then turns north and dissipates in the Aleutians. At the same time, the target ships have been parked at designated locations, including the U.S. Navy battleships "Arkansas," "New York," "Nevada," and "Pennsylvania," the heavy cruisers "Pensacola" and "Salt Lake City," the aircraft carrier "Saratoga," and the light aircraft carrier "Independence." The Japanese battleship "Nagato," the Japanese light cruiser "Sakawa," and the German heavy cruiser "Prinz Eugen" are also in the list. The remaining target ships are landing craft and transport craft. The target center point for the first atomic bomb is the "Nevada," a ship with a displacement of 29,000 tons, painted light orange, with 300 white rats placed on it.</p>
<p>A portion of the goats will be placed in exposed areas on the target ship, while another portion will be isolated. A portion of the goats will be covered with various fabrics and placed in exposed areas, and those approaching the target center point will be coated with various reflective creams for protection. Various military materials and food, from 46-ton tanks and 2-ton bombs to canned peas, from various ammunition to coal, will be exposed on the target ships in a military strategy to test the effects of flame heat, shock, and wireless power on inanimate objects and ammunition. In addition to testing the effectiveness of core explosions on warships, this test has other goals: (1) To test the effectiveness on aircraft. (2) To further understand the effectiveness on humans. (3) To understand the comparative value of atomic bombs for warships and other targets. (4) To understand the general scientific value of phenomena occurring simultaneously with atomic explosions. Those who criticize this test estimate that the test will cost more than 500 million dollars, but according to Navy official Lieutenant Commander Juryha:</p>
<p>Total Test Costs</p>
<p>Will not exceed 110 million dollars. According to atomic test commander Blandy, it is not known what actual results will occur to the ships and targets, but it is believed that the following things will not occur: (1) It will not kill half of the fish in the sea, but it will kill the fish in the lagoon. (2) It will not cause earthquakes or create new mountains, nor will it cause tsunamis. (3) It will not cause a continuous explosive reaction in the water, turning it all into poisonous gas and sinking all ships into the seabed. (4) It will not destroy gravity. By dawn on the 30th of this month, Bikini Island will be uninhabited, and the only living creatures left will be the white rats and goats on the target ships.</p>

<h3>Kwantung Army Unrestrained: Initiates September 18th Incident; Wakatsuki Testifies at International Court; Ugaki Testifies on Political Situation During Tenure</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th Special Dispatch] Wakatsuki Reijiro, who was the Japanese Prime Minister at the time of the September 18th Incident, testified to the International War Crimes Tribunal this morning that the Kwantung Army was completely unrestrained, and its occupation of the Northeast violated the wishes of the cabinet. Although the cabinet tried to organize a joint cabinet by the two powerful political parties at the time in order to place the army under control and exert pressure, his cabinet only learned of the incident one day after the September 18th Incident, on September 19th, 1931, and was forced to resign immediately.</p>
<p>After Wakatsuki's interrogation, General Ugaki Kazushige, formerly a "planet" in Japanese politics, was called to testify, and the court suddenly became tense. Prosecutor Helen宜 read his testimony: "In 1924, when I was Minister of the Army, I successfully ordered the downsizing of the army. During the time of the Hamaguchi cabinet as Minister of the Army, in January or February 1931, a non-commissioned officer of the military police reported that Dr. Okawa Shumei planned to carry out some kind of demonstration in the parliament. At the end of March of the same year, Okawa wrote a letter advising me to take the lead in the Showa Restoration Movement. Later, many officers in the General Staff Headquarters reported this matter, so I discussed it with Koiso, the director of the military affairs bureau, and Sugiyama, the deputy minister. The two reported that Okawa and others were plotting to overthrow the government and had designated me as the prime minister of the revolutionary government. I immediately ordered Koiso and Sugiyama to immediately stop all plans to use the army to carry out the revolution. That conspiracy was the March Incident. I resigned with the Hamaguchi cabinet on April 13, 1931, and voluntarily withdrew from the army. After the collapse of the Hirota cabinet in 1928, I received an order to form a cabinet. Because I reduced military preparations when I was Minister of the Army and refused to assist the militarist March Incident, the three military ministers recommended at that time refused to take office, so the cabinet was not formed."</p>
<h3>Inuikai Tsuyoshi's Son Makes Contradictory Statements</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 28th] Inuikai Tsuyoshi's son, Inuikai Ken, continued to testify at the Far East International Military Tribunal today, but the position of Emperor Hirohito in the "Manchurian Incident" was still not clear. Inuikai Ken's statement yesterday stated on the one hand that the Emperor loved peace, and on the other hand, he refused to issue an edict to withdraw the Japanese army from Manchuria. Chief Judge Webb pointed out that it was self-contradictory and did not want to listen to his words again, but some judges wanted Inuikai Ken to explain this point further. According to his continued testimony today: Inuikai Tsuyoshi actually requested the Emperor to issue an edict, or only contacted the Minister of the Imperial Household, but it was not clear, but he believed that he definitely intended to order the Emperor to end the Manchurian Incident.</p>
<h3>Trial Lacks Drama; Many Japanese People in the Audience</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 28th] The trial of war criminals by the International Tribunal was originally expected to become the largest dramatic performance in Asia, but it is now silent and uninteresting, and the number of audience members is gradually decreasing. The criticism of the U.S. Prosecutor's Office staff in San Francisco for their poor work has caused widespread indifference, and it seems that judges, audiences, and reporters are all affected by it. Unlike the Germans, the Japanese have automatically become enthusiastic viewers. They want to know the truth about the military regime for fifteen years. In the past, propaganda was deceiving, and now they all want to open their eyes and see for themselves.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] International Tribunal Prosecutor Keenan declared today that Prosecutor's Office staff member McMorling requested a promotion and failed, and resigned out of disappointment. The resignation has been approved. McMorling issued a statement this morning accusing the prosecution of being poorly managed, negligent and ineffective.</p>

<h3>Bread Rationing to be Implemented Nationwide in Britain Starting July 21st, Lasting at Least 18 Months, Housewives' League Expresses Opposition</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] According to authoritative sources, Britain will implement bread rationing for the first time in its history starting July 21st, with a possible duration of at least eighteen months.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] British Food Minister Strachey announced to Parliament today that bread and flour will be rationed starting July 21st. The implementation of food restrictions, which were avoided even at the height of the Atlantic war, fourteen months after the end of the European war, immediately aroused strong protests from all sides. Opposition leader Churchill stated to Parliament that this was one of the most serious measures taken during peacetime. The British Housewives' League also expressed its opposition, as this measure would particularly affect the lower and middle classes, whose staple food is bread, which is one of the reasons for their opposition. It is understood that the specified ration amounts are as follows: approximately nine ounces per day for adults, twelve ounces for children aged eleven to eighteen, eight ounces for children aged five to eleven, four ounces for children aged one to five, two ounces for infants under one year old, and additional rations for manual laborers and breastfeeding mothers.</p>
<h3>Hungary Issues New Banknote with a Face Value of One Trillion</h3>

In 1939, one pengő was approximately equal to one shilling, but its value is now impossible to estimate due to hyperinflation.</p>

<h3>Two Railway Administrations Discover a Major Embezzlement Case</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Zhang Bokang, the chief of the Procurement Section of the Materials Department of the Two Railway Administrations, colluded with a senior staff member to embezzle public funds for personal gain. The scheme was leaked, and the Two Railway Police Department has detained them. This reporter visited the person in charge of the Railway Administration to inquire about the truth. According to him, since the restoration last year, all necessities have been purchased by the Procurement Section. The responsible personnel of the section took advantage of their positions to embezzle public funds, which the Railway Administration had long heard about, but they were unable to arrest them due to lack of evidence. However, the definite evidence of their corruption was discovered when a large number of blue khaki uniforms were定制 (dìngzhì, custom made) for the employees of the Two Railways a few days ago. The sewing cost for each set of khaki uniform on the market is only 20,000 yuan, but when the section contacted a certain place to order the uniforms, it actually paid 30,000 yuan. The evidence of their collusion and embezzlement was finally discovered through various searches. The embezzlement of procurement materials by the section is not limited to this one incident. There have been frequent anonymous reports since last October, so the amount of embezzlement is very alarming. The seriousness of the embezzlement case is no less than that of the grain loan case.</p>
<p>Regarding the details of the case, the person in charge of the Railway Administration stated that the investigation is still in progress, and it is intended to postpone the announcement for the time being. The implications are quite extensive, and the bureau intends to invite accountants to conduct a detailed audit of all past accounts. Zhang Bokang and several others are currently in custody and are being closely interrogated by the Police Department.</p>
<h3>100,000 Dan of Sichuan Rice Arrives in Shanghai, Over 7,000 Packages Opened for Distribution</h3>
<p>Premier Song Telephones Minister Xu to Come to Shanghai Overnight</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The rice market has experienced drastic fluctuations again in recent days, and the authorities are making every effort to suppress it. In addition to strictly prohibiting grain merchants from engaging in illegal activities such as hoarding or black market trading, they are also trying to find ways to increase the rice supply. Yesterday, the municipal government dispatched personnel to consult with the Garrison Headquarters and decided to release the more than 7,000 packages of rice seized from the Santai Rice Firm, Changjiang Company, and the Wan Shunfu Rice Firm in Xie Daheng, which were sealed in the grain loan embezzlement case. The Inspection Department was ordered to open them and hand them over to the Social Affairs Bureau for public distribution, with all proceeds remitted to the National Treasury of the Central Bank. As for the detailed distribution methods and prescribed prices, they will be drafted by the Social Affairs Bureau and submitted to Mayor Wu for decision. According to news from the Social Affairs Bureau, the selling price of the rice is set at 38,000 to 46,000 yuan per shi (石, unit of dry measure, approx. 100 liters).</p>
<p>[Another report] The central authorities previously decided to transport two million shi of stored rice from Sichuan Province to Shanghai to regulate the food supply for the people. It has now been confirmed that the first batch of 100,000 dan (担, unit of weight, approx. 50 kg) arrived here yesterday. Mayor Wu visited Premier Song at 9:00 yesterday morning to ask for instructions on how to distribute the Sichuan rice. He suggested that since the Sichuan rice belonged to the Ministry of Food, Minister Xu Kan should be invited to Shanghai to discuss the matter. It is reported that Premier Song immediately telegraphed Minister Xu, ordering him to take the overnight train to Shanghai last night. It is expected that after Minister Xu arrives in Shanghai today and consults with the municipal government, the 100,000 dan of Sichuan rice will be distributed to various retail rice shops at a fair price within one or two days. Mayor Wu also discussed with Mr. Song during the meeting yesterday the issues of smoothing and regulating the source of food in the city in the future. It is reported that a comprehensive method has been determined to ensure that there will be no shortage of food in the city in the future. According to Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, after the Sichuan rice arrives in Shanghai, it will be directly distributed to various retail rice shops at the prescribed price of 46,000 yuan per dan at a fair price. The rice shops must mark the price and sell the rice openly when selling the Sichuan rice. If any violations are found, the subsequently arrived Sichuan rice and other government-controlled food will never be allocated.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu also summoned Qu Zhenhua and five other executive directors of the Rice Industry Association at 2:00 PM yesterday to talk about the recent intentional hiding of rice by some rice shops, which has affected the food supply for the people. He sternly reprimanded them and informed them that the Sichuan rice has arrived in Shanghai and will soon be distributed to various rice shops for sale, and discussed the distribution methods with them.</p>
<p>Garrison Headquarters Re-interrogates Two Grain Officials</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] As a result of the continuous investigation and interrogation by the Military Law Office of the Garrison Headquarters into the Grain Loan Case, it was found that there were some key points that were not yet clear. Therefore, Ren Xingya in Da Ren was re-interrogated yesterday. The official letter from the headquarters to the Ministry of Food for investigation was issued on the 24th, but the Ministry of Food has not yet responded. Also, the District Procuratorate previously sent a letter requesting the extradition of Wu Rong-sheng and Wang Xun-zhi, but it was unsuccessful. According to reporter inquiries, it is likely that these two will not be extradited at present.</p>
<p>[Another report] Regarding whether the statements made by Wang Daren to the Garrison Headquarters in the grain merchant loan case were true, a telegram was sent to the Ministry of Food for inquiry. The date of the telegram was June 24th. The Ministry of Food received it on the evening of the 27th and replied by telegram on the 28th.</p>
<p>Grain Administration Office Transfers Archives</p>
<p>After the closure of the Shanghai Grain Administration Office of the Ministry of Food, it has been decided that all its administrative affairs will be taken over by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. A portion of the archives related to regulating the food supply for the people, market transaction management, and control registration will also be transferred to the Social Affairs Bureau for reception. It is understood that the Grain Administration Office has now transferred the unregistered rice shop case files to the Social Affairs Bureau. The bureau plans to establish a Food Division on July 1st to handle the matter specifically, and the budget has been submitted to the municipal government, but has not yet been approved. However, the work of the Grain Administration Office is currently being handled by the bureau, temporarily managed by the Fourth Section of the First Department before the Food Division is established.</p>

<h3>Two Russian Leaders of the Fascist Party Arrested in Shanghai</h3>
<p>They Used Alcohol to Finance the Enemy and Assisted German and Japanese Work</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The former Russian leader of the Fascist Party in China, Paishafsky, and the leader of the Shanghai branch, Oklovsky, were active in Shanghai during the enemy occupation. Recently, the 　局 (jú, a government bureau/department) was ordered by the Military Commission to arrest Oklovsky at No. 3, Lane 70, Leli Road on the 15th. After taking him to the bureau for questioning, he confessed that he had used alcohol to finance the enemy during the puppet regime, and also confessed that Paishafsky, the leader in China, was hiding at No. 375 Mercer Road. So they rushed to the address and arrested him as well. A large number of reactionary books were found in Pai's room, including two books written by Pai, one titled "Meaning and Life" and the other titled "About Our Truth and Rights". The words were absurd and the content was biased towards the Axis powers. They were all taken to the bureau for interrogation. According to the confession, the highest leader of the party in the Far East was Luo Chai Aifu Siji, who is not currently in Shanghai. They directly admitted that they helped Japan and Germany work during the puppet organization. Now that the interrogation has been completed, they were transferred to the Garrison Headquarters at 3:00 PM yesterday and then to the Military Tribunal of the Military Commission for trial.</p>

<h3>Repatriation of German Overseas Chinese Postponed, Houses Left Behind Temporarily Not to be Received</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to the list approved by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the German Overseas Chinese Management Committee originally planned to repatriate the first batch of more than 700 German overseas Chinese back to their country tomorrow.

<h3>Wake Up, You Who Dream of Gold!</h3>
<p>The era of soaring and plummeting prices and profiting from the "oil and water" is over.</p>
<p>Even though everyone knows that gold cannot be eaten when hungry nor worn when cold, Shanghai residents are particularly obsessed with gold. Rather than saying that the eight years of war brought about rapid inflation, it is more accurate to say that it deepened the frenzy of materialism in Shanghai!</p>
<p>If you don't believe it, look at Shanghai today. Zhang San and Li Si, when they extend their hands, almost always have a gold ring on their finger. To cater to the general public's fondness for gold jewelry, new silver shops are springing up like mushrooms after a rain. When discussing real estate, cars, or other transactions, asking for a certain number of "bars" or "strips" of gold is the common language in the trading market.</p>
<p>As a writer, this reporter has always been poorly informed and rarely seen anything related to gold. This has piqued my interest in visiting gold shops. I selected several gold shops with decades of history and had lengthy, trivial conversations with several shop owners who were over sixty years old.</p>
<p>As soon as the conversation started, they instinctively reminisced about their youth. During the Republic years 8 or 9 (1919 or 1920), gold in Shanghai was only 18 or 19 yuan per tael. At that time, they still used the "dan" scale, with sixteen taels making a "jin" (catty). After switching to the municipal scale, one "jin" only had thirteen taels and six qian and four fen compared to before.</p>
<p>The "sha chi" (cooked red) commonly referred to in the market should, as the name suggests, be pure gold. However, this statement can only be made relatively. This is because there is no such equipment or skill in Shanghai to refine it to such a pure degree. It is said that the highest purity that can be achieved is 99.45%. But this statement could only be made twenty years ago, because the currently circulating "sha chi" has a purity of 99.3%.</p>
<p>The Source of the Bars</p>
<p>Regarding the source of gold in this city, gold bars made of placer gold from the northeastern provinces are usually very famous domestically. However, their purity varies depending on the location, generally ranging from 89.88 to 81.88. Gold produced in Jinzhou has a higher purity, generally around 97 or 98. Other places, such as Zhaoyuan and Muping in Shandong, also produce and transport small amounts of gold. The purity is lower, with the lowest being only 20-30% and the highest being 70-80%.</p>
<p>Speaking of the gold bars circulating in the market, there are generally two types: "mao tiao" (rough bars) and "guang tiao" (smooth bars). "Mao tiao" are all melted and cast by various gold shops in the city. Each bar is about five inches long, one inch wide, and just over two fen thick. One side has the shop's brand name in engraved characters. These gold bars have uneven surfaces and look very ugly, hence the nickname "mao tiao". However, their purity is 99.3%. The other type is "guang tiao," which are issued by the enemy in exchange for buying gauze. The surface is smooth and flat, and there is no engraved brand name. The purity is between 99.1 and 99.2. It is said that the gold bars recently transported from abroad by the Central Bank in batches are mostly 400 troy ounces each, and the purity is close to 99.9, only a slight difference from pure gold. Therefore, when entrusting the gold shops to melt and cast them, the purity has to be diluted a bit.</p>
<p>At this point, the reporter actually visited a gold bar casting workshop. The main equipment is just an old carbon arc furnace. A small pile of burning charcoal is in the middle. The container for melting the gold is a clay pot about half a foot in diameter. When melting, it is necessary to test its heat resistance first. A small pot can melt more than two hundred taels of gold. After melting, a pottery bowl the size of a soy sauce dish is held with iron tongs and filled with a small bowl from the melting pot, just enough to fill the iron gold bar mold. During the cooling process in the mold, a blowpipe is used to blow air from time to time. After it solidifies and is poured out of the mold, it is none other than the gold bar that has driven the Shanghai trading market crazy. But its birth process is so ugly!</p>
<p>Revealing the True Colors on the Touchstone</p>
<p>The "touchstone" that is often used in news rhetoric was finally seen in the gold shop. It is a flat, thin, oval-shaped stone, dark black in color. It is said that the output of this item is extremely small, mostly from Sichuan. The stone should be light and tender, easy to grind gold on, and easy to show color. When testing the purity of gold, just grind the gold on the touchstone a dozen times, and the black stone bottom will highlight bright golden streaks. Then, carefully check this gold against small pieces of gold standards. These gold standards are divided into two strings, pure and mixed, with sixty or seventy pieces in the pure string and more than one hundred and twenty pieces in the mixed string, each piece representing a different purity. Under the sharp eyes of the gold assayer, the good or bad quality of any gold will be revealed in its true form. However, it takes ten or twenty years of training for a gold assayer to reach a state of perfection!</p>
<p>It is said that the recent activity in gold, with silver shops experiencing booming sales, is a major reason. This explains the reason for the flourishing of new silver shops! A new silver shop on Nanjing Road spared no expense, paying an astonishing price of ninety gold bars to secure a prime storefront. A certain silver shop in Laoximen also spent more than seventy gold bars to secure a prime storefront. Is it really possible to "earn it all back" after opening? The answers from gold industry leaders are quite bleak. They said that the large companies currently sell about a hundred taels a day, and the small and medium-sized companies sell about forty or fifty taels. The gross profit per tael is ten thousand kuai. However, after deducting 3,500 yuan for the master, craftsman, and shop assistant's share, and 1.5% business income tax, which is 3,000 yuan per tael based on 200,000 yuan per tael, what is left must be used to pay for all expenses, so the profit is self-evident. Therefore, many newly opened silver shops are crying for help. By the end of this year, there will probably be sights to see!</p>
<p>The Illusionary Dream of Gold</p>
<p>The people of Shanghai have always valued gold highly. With the gradual shrinking of the speculative market, they are again indulging in the illusionary dream of the future of the gold market. Everyone thinks that one day, gold will skyrocket. However, the words that appear in the mouths of gold industry leaders are exactly the opposite of the fantasies of the people of Shanghai. They say that the appetite of Shanghai people for swallowing gold is like swallowing arsenic, swallowing it indiscriminately. Just speaking of the figures for the Central Bank's sale of gold in the past three months, it has reached more than 300,000 taels. Nearly 60 billion yuan has been withdrawn from circulation. However, the Central Bank is still continuously selling.</p>
<p>It is estimated that Shanghai's gold reserves were already considerable before the August 13th Incident. During the enemy occupation period, the enemy also brought in a batch of gold one after another. As of the enemy's surrender, the vaults of the puppet Central Reserve Bank were said to still contain 400,000 taels of gold. It is estimated that the gold currently scattered in the hands of Shanghai residents is also more than one million taels. As for the Central Bank's vaults, the readily available gold is at least "several" million taels. Let the readers draw their own conclusions about the size of this "several" number. However, it is worth noting that the Central Bank is still continuously transporting gold from the United States, and the more than 300,000 taels that have already been sold is just a drop in the bucket.</p>
<p>Wake up, Shanghai people who are dreaming of gold. The era of soaring and plummeting prices and profiting from the "oil and water" is over. However, the trauma of the total collapse of the government bond market is still fresh. Hopefully, the gold rush will not be a repeat of that disaster! (Cang Long)</p>

<h3>The Drama Community Sympathizes with the Theater Industry. The Municipal Council Meeting Decided Yesterday to Accept Two Requests.</h3>
<p>The entertainment tax is still levied at 50 percent.</p>
<p>(Our newspaper's report) The Shanghai Theater Industry Association requested the Municipal Government to reduce the entertainment tax the day before yesterday, but it was not approved. The association then decided to automatically suspend business from July 1st. The association also invited the drama community yesterday afternoon to request unified action. However, the drama community's taxes have already been reduced by the Municipal Government, so there is no need to suspend business at present. However, out of sympathy, it was unanimously decided to suspend all performances for one day on July 1st in response. It is also reported that the film industry does not intend to participate this time.</p>
<p>[Another report] The Shanghai Theater Industry Association sent representatives on the morning of the 26th to visit Mayor Wu and others to request: (1) extending business hours to 12:00 midnight, (2) abolishing price limits on tickets, and (3) reducing the defense surtax by 20 percent. As the third request for tax reduction did not yield results, a general meeting of all members was convened the day before yesterday, and it was decided to suspend all business from July 1st. In the Municipal Council meeting held yesterday morning, the case was brought up for discussion. It was decided on the theater industry association's request: (1) to allow extended business hours to 12:00 midnight, (2) to allow flexible ticket prices except for one-third of the seats sold at the lowest price, and (3) to maintain the original entertainment tax, levying it at 50 percent. After the meeting, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau immediately informed Zhou Jianxing, the chairman of the Theater Industry Association, and asked him to notify all members of the association.</p>
<h3>One Wave Has Not Subsided, Another Wave Rises. Xu Shihui and Xu Peihuang, Father and Son, Are Accused of Defamation for Attacking the Court.</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's report] Tao, the chief prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office, recently filed a case against someone who insulted the court. The case involves Xu Peihuang, a student at St. Francis Xavier High School, who collided with and killed an elderly Mr. Shen while riding a bicycle on Jiangxi Road in Zhongzheng East Road. The Criminal Court of the District Court sentenced him to four months in prison, suspended for two years. Xu refused to accept the sentence and, instead of following the legal procedure of appealing, wrote an article in the "Voice of the Readers" column of the Xinwen Bao newspaper on May 19th, stating that the District Court was illegally sentencing him. He also claimed: "They negotiated with my father, asking him to settle the matter with 25 gold bars and promising to appeal on his behalf and declare him innocent. I don't know what kind of extraordinary powers they have to play with the solemn national law. I swear here that if the above facts are false, I am willing to be judged by the public..." After reading the newspaper, Chief Prosecutor Quan immediately investigated. Xu Peihuang actually said that he didn't know who wanted the gold bars. His father, Xu Shihui, said that it was Zhao, a relative of the opposing party, and that the purpose of asking for gold bars was for civil compensation and settlement. After investigation, the court believed that a fifteen-year-old boy dared to disregard the law and attack the court recklessly. His father was not without incitement. Therefore, Quan, the prosecutor, filed a public prosecution against them for the crime of aggravated defamation, as accomplices to Articles 28, 29, Paragraph 1, Paragraph 2, and 310, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law.</p>
<h3>The Telecommunications Bureau Prohibits Messengers from Extorting.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau has always strictly prohibited messengers from extorting tips from customers. Public notices have been issued and orders have been solemnly filed. However, recently, two people were specifically accused of the above-mentioned behavior. After verification, they were immediately dismissed. Afterwards, it was heard that some people were still requesting tips on various pretexts. The municipal military and political authorities dispatched officers to assist the bureau, offering earnest persuasion and warning them not to engage in any excessive actions such as work slowdowns. Therefore, no incidents occurred. It is also heard that the military and police authorities are closely monitoring anyone who intends to incite trouble.</p>
<h3>Military Tribunal Tries the Righteous Man Batardini. Testimony Shows He Was Under Mussolini's Orders. Whether International Law Was Violated Is Worth Studying.</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's report] Former commander of the Italian Marine Corps in Shanghai, Batardini, was brought to trial by Judge Tang Mingshi of the Military Tribunal yesterday. At the beginning, the defendant testified that matters such as the release of Italian expatriates from concentration camps and the assistance to the Japanese army in working at the Jiangnan Shipyard were all under the orders of the Mussolini government. He went to Tokyo to discuss with the Italian representative and then returned to Shanghai, only responsible for managing the expatriates. There were about 200 Italian expatriates working at the Jiangnan Shipyard, many of whom voluntarily participated to solve their livelihood problems. The court then summoned four Italian expatriates who served as liaison officers and doctors, including Baofoli, to testify. They stated that because the Japanese side provided workers with rations of rice and flour, many people did indeed voluntarily participate to solve their livelihood problems, and the work they did was only hard labor such as transportation. At this point, the court ordered a postponement for retrial. Judge Tang told reporters that although this case is not serious, it is an interesting question of international law. Because there were two governments in Italy at the time, one presided over by the Italian King and one presided over by Mussolini, it is worth studying whether the defendant's obedience to the latter's orders violated international law.</p>

<h3>Fuya School Holds Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] The Shanghai Fuya School for the Deaf and Mute, located at No. 33 Huangjiasha Hua Road, held an art exhibition on the 27th, displaying over 200 works of Chinese painting, Western painting, pastels, calligraphy, bamboo carvings, plaster sculptures, bas-reliefs, and self-made New Year's cards, all of which were carefully created by the school's deaf and mute students. Although the deaf and mute suffer from sensory impairments, their brainpower, eyesight, and wrist strength are often healthier than those of ordinary people, so their interest in art is also more intense than that of ordinary people. The school authorities have taken advantage of this trend and achieved remarkable results. This exhibition is also the first since the victory.</p>
<h3>Xingdong Football Expeditionary Force Flies Back to Hong Kong This Morning</h3>
<p>Overall, the Record in Shanghai of Four Wins and Four Losses is Still Good, and Departure for Australia is Scheduled for Early July</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Xingdong Football Expeditionary Force, which arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong at the end of this month, played eight matches in Shanghai, winning four and losing four. In the first match, they defeated the British Navy 6-0, in the second match, they defeated Xilian 4-1, in the third match, they defeated the Jews 5-3, and in the fourth match, they defeated Donghua 5-2. Subsequently, their fortune waned. In the fifth match, they lost to Qingbai 1-3, in the sixth match, they lost to Hualian 2-3, in the seventh match, they were defeated by Qingbai again 1-2, and in the eighth match, a small-scale football demonstration, they lost to Xilian 3-5. With mixed success and failure, the results are still satisfactory. It is now learned that the team's expedition to Shanghai has come to an end, and the entire team of sixteen people is scheduled to take a China Airlines plane back to Hong Kong at 8 a.m. this morning. Yesterday, the reporter visited the team's captain, Xu Jingcheng, to inquire about his feelings in Shanghai and the expedition to Australia. According to him: "The Shanghai fans' interest in football matches is more enthusiastic than that of Hong Kong, and the level of football skills is also quite ideal. The expedition to Australia had already been prepared in detail before coming to Shanghai. The entry procedures in Australia are troublesome, and the entry deposit certificate also needs to be raised. However, after leaving Shanghai, Hu Hao will be responsible for handling it immediately. The round trip to Australia will take 40 days, and assuming 16 matches are played there, it will take about a month, so the total time required will be two months. If we leave on July 10, we will return to Hong Kong in early September. The Hong Kong football season has already begun, and we are currently in contact with the British Air Force Command to try to arrange a flight, which would allow us to reach Australia in three days, and the journey would be more relaxed." The reporter also asked when he would come again, and he said: "I have been away from Shanghai for ten years, and I am very excited to return this time. If there is an opportunity in the future, I would like to come again, and I have heard that Shanghai will have a team to visit Hong Kong, which is very welcome." Finally, he expressed his gratitude to the sports news circles in this city.</p>

<h3>Special Article: The Crippled Young Mathematician Hua Luogeng Talks About His Impressions of the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Kunming, This Newspaper, 18th, Airmail Special Correspondent Zhang Shengli</p>
<p>Speaking of the professors of Tsinghua University, people often notice two more special figures—one is the one-legged Pan Guangdan, and the other is the crippled Hua Luogeng; one studies eugenics, one specializes in mathematics; one talks about democracy, one does not ask about politics; one is old and one is young, each with their own merits. Professor Pan has been famous for a long time, so we will omit it for now. And the name Hua Luogeng, in the past few years. Only a few people began to pay attention. Veteran professors say: "He is a rising star." The general public says: "He is also a professor"? Last winter, Minister Chen Ci invited him to Chongqing, for an airplane ticket, he sighed and said "the most basic important person," squeezed down three times, recently, after he returned from the Soviet Union with honor, although he only wore a very ordinary suit, many people suddenly regarded him as an important person in academia, making him busy with lectures, meeting guests, and some even held out their thumbs and said: "Our China," or said: "Our Southwest United University," "also has this amazing figure"!</p>
<p>Regarding the life of Hua Luogeng, there have been fragmented records in the newspapers. Hua was born in Jintan, Jiangsu, and is now thirty-seven years old. His family was well-off in his childhood, and his father ran a cotton shop, but due to old age and frailty, it went from bad to worse. When Hua was studying at Jintan Junior High School, his math scores were often 50 points, but his teacher Wang Weike discovered that he had a mathematical talent, so he often encouraged and helped him. After graduating at the age of fifteen, he could not find a job and could not go to school, so he worked as a small shopkeeper at home for more than five years. Later, he was introduced by Mr. Wang Weike to serve as a general affairs accountant and teach a class at Jintan Junior High School. However, he was attacked as an unqualified teacher and resigned immediately. At the age of twenty-one, his fellow villager Mr. Kang Peijin (currently the Dean of Academic Affairs at National Central University) introduced him to Tsinghua University to work as an assistant in the mathematics department. Within four years, he was promoted three levels, and his position went from assistant to researcher. His mathematical talent was developed and demonstrated at this point for the first time. After serving as a researcher at the school for three years, he was sent to Cambridge University in England for further study, and returned to China after two years. He came to Kunming in the twenty-eighth year and served as a professor at Tsinghua University, teaching at Southwest United University.</p>
<p>Hua's achievements in mathematics are due to his talent and efforts, and his wife has also given him great help. He married at the age of twenty and now has three sons and one daughter. According to Hua: "I graduated from junior high school, and she graduated from elementary school. It can be said that we are a perfect match." In the year of their marriage, typhoid fever was prevalent in Jintan, and many residents of the county town died from this epidemic. Hua also contracted this disease and, after treatment with traditional Chinese and Western medicine, developed arthritis. Although he was lucky enough to escape death, his left leg was crippled as a result. During Hua's visit to the Soviet Union, Soviet medical circles believed that curing his leg was a very simple matter and would only take four months. Hua did not seek medical treatment because of special questions. Once, he went to a medical research institute to get a vaccination, and the doctor talked about his leg again. Hua asked how much it would cost, and the doctor said strangely, "Does this cost money?" Hua asked in return: "Doesn't this cost money?" They looked at each other and laughed.</p>
<p>Hua's visit to the Soviet Union was due to his writings. In 1941, Hua compiled his writings over the years into "Additive Prime Number Theory" and sent it to the Soviet Academy of Sciences for publication, but it was shelved due to the German-Soviet War. After the victory of the European War, the Academy of Sciences translated the book into Russian. Soviet mathematicians considered the book one of the finest mathematical works and regarded Hua's achievements as having reached the world's first-class standard. Therefore, the Academy of Sciences invited Hua to the Soviet Union. He left Kunming on February 25, traveled through India, Iraq, and Iran to Moscow, and returned to Kunming via the same route on May 25, a total of three months. He spent more than fifty days in the Soviet Union, visiting and lecturing in Moscow, Leningrad, Baku, Tbilisi, and other places. However, because his Russian foundation was poor, he often needed the help of a translator. After returning to Kunming, he did not talk about Soviet politics or mention the atomic bomb in public or private, which disappointed some curious visitors.</p>
<p>Regarding his impressions of the Soviet Union, Hua gave several brief public lectures on Soviet science and higher education. According to him: In the Soviet Union's new five-year plan, the two most important goals are: (1) to restore production to 140% of pre-war levels; (2) to focus on the development of science. In 1944, the Soviet Union's budget for education, culture, and science was 514 million rubles, of which 211 million was for education, 104 million was for public health, 13 million was for scientific research, and 44 million was for training specialists. These figures do not include all research institutions, such as the All-Union Academy of Sciences, various People's Committee research institutes, school research institutes, and people's organization research institutes, whose funding is budgeted separately. This shows the enormous scale of scientific expenditure. The All-Union Academy of Sciences is divided into eight departments, 76 research institutes, and had 5,000 staff members in 1940, which increased to 7,000 in 1942. There are also many laboratories, observatories, and measuring stations. The highest administrative body of the Academy of Sciences is composed of 118 researchers, in addition to 180 correspondents and five honorary researchers, one of whom is Stalin. The All-Union Academy of Sciences is controlled by these researchers. When a researcher position becomes vacant, candidates are first recommended by various research institutes and social organizations, then their qualifications are reviewed by the Academy of Sciences organizing committee, and then submitted to the academy's general meeting for approval, requiring a two-thirds vote to be elected. Therefore, being a researcher in the Soviet Union is extremely difficult and extremely glorious. Researchers and professors receive relatively high salaries. An ordinary university professor earns 12,000 rubles per month, which is about US$1,000. In the United States, Einstein's annual salary is only US$10,000 to US$12,000, which is less than that of an ordinary Soviet professor. Researchers earn 22,000 rubles per month. The government also has a scientists' store that sells cheap goods, and no one other than scientists can enter to shop. In terms of spiritual rewards, there are two types of gold medals: the Hero of Labor Medal and the Stalin Medal. Only 15 people in the All-Union Academy of Sciences have received these medals, including two mathematicians.</p>
<p>Hua mentioned the scientific research in other small republics, citing two more special examples: (1) The Azerbaijan Republic, with a population of only one million, the four ministers in charge are all under the age of 38, and the focus of their scientists' work is on researching oil refining and geological surveys, to which they have made great contributions; (2) The Georgian Republic, the hometown of Stalin, the capital Tbilisi, is a mathematical paradise, the Minister of Education, the President of the University, and the President of the Academy of Sciences are all well-known mathematicians in the Soviet Union, there are 2,000 students at the University of Georgia, 600 of whom study mathematics, and there are more than 100 professors at Moscow University, 52 of whom teach mathematics, which shows the Soviet Union's emphasis on mathematics. Hua extremely admired the great mathematician Pontryagin, who lost his sight at the age of five, and he felt very strange when he first met this professor at Moscow University, he felt that this was not easy to achieve in other countries.</p>
<p>Regarding Soviet university education, Hua gave a lecture at Yunnan University. According to him: Soviet universities are only divided into departments, not colleges, universities with fewer departments have a supervisor (equivalent to the president) and two deputy supervisors (i.e., vice presidents). Universities with more departments have a supervisor for each department, and the administrative affairs of the school are jointly responsible by these people. Industrial colleges generally have six departments. Agricultural research institutes usually only have two to three departments. Any institution that can be called a university must have at least seven departments, such as Moscow University, which has eleven departments. In addition to the departments, universities also have many lecture halls, teaching special subjects, Moscow University has lectures in more than 120 subjects. Speaking of the number of higher education institutions, there are currently 762 higher schools, 128 industrial higher vocational schools, 23 art short-term schools, 87 medical higher vocational schools, 29 universities, 112 normal schools, and 69 agricultural colleges in the Soviet Union. There are 560,000 university students and 40,000 professors. After the war, due to a lack of school buildings, many schools still operate in shifts. At the universities of Moscow and Leningrad, students pay a tuition fee of 400 rubles per semester, but can receive many scholarships from the school, about 200 to 300 rubles per month, enough for a month's use, scholarships account for one-third of the school's budget, which is not available in other countries. Primary and secondary schools are completely free for five years each, and after ten years, they enter university. University graduates' jobs have long been included in the national five-year plan. Those who have special knowledge in a certain subject can continue to enter the graduate school, and a research fee of 750 rubles is paid monthly. In the first two years, they study special subjects, and in the third year, they write a thesis. After graduation, they can enter the doctoral graduate school, and the monthly research fee is 1,500 rubles. After one year of research, if the thesis passes, they will get a doctoral degree.</p>
<p>Speaking of the general situation in the Soviet Union, Hua said: Prices rose by 50% during the war, and prices have fallen by 40% after the war. Food is not a problem, and clothing is worse than in Britain and the United States. Although the faces of ordinary people are very thin, no beggars have been seen. Reconstruction work is actively underway everywhere, and they seem to have no situation where they are not recovering. He said: "The Soviet Union, whether you like her or hate her, is worth understanding." This young mathematician who worked hard and succeeded was deeply touched after returning from his visit to the Soviet Union. He hopes that our country should also work together. (June 18)</p>

<h3>Allotment System Still Being Implemented: Rice Shops Actually Have No Goods to Supply</h3>
<p>Relevant Authorities Are Planning Thorough Stabilization Measures; Mayor Wu Summons Rice Industry Leaders to Inquire About the Situation</p>
<p>The trend of people's food in this city has gradually become serious in recent days. Rice shops have no goods to supply, which has caused no small stimulus to people's hearts. However, the rice market will still register daily guest rice and allot it to the registered rice shops. However, there is too little gruel and too many monks. Therefore, dredging the source of rice and replenishing the reserves are extremely important current tasks. Since the rice shops adopted the allotment system, the general rice merchants have refused to register the rice they transport to Shanghai in the market and trade privately outside, resulting in black market transactions. At the same time, rice merchants believe that there is no heavy profit to be made, so they lack the energy to purchase. The relevant authorities in this city are now working day and night to plan and seek thorough stabilization of the people's food in this city. It is generally believed that the scarcity of rice arriving in Shanghai and the insufficient reserves are one of the reasons for the unstable state of the rice market. However, it is also a major reason that some rice worms are causing trouble from the middle, trying to raise prices and profit, causing people to feel uneasy. Now the authorities will gradually find ways to resolve this kind of situation. If anyone illegally hoards food rice, or rice shops hide it and do not sell it, anyone can report it for investigation. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau have sent personnel to investigate secretly. Mayor Wu also summoned the responsible persons of the Rice Shop Public Association at the City Hall to inquire about the rice market situation and gave important instructions.</p>
<p>Various Sources Arriving Continuously: Registration of Guest Goods Increases</p>
<p>The source of rice has increased. Yesterday, the total registration of guest goods in the rice market reached 4,282 dan, an increase of 1,317 dan compared with the previous market. Among them, milled glutinous rice accounted for the largest number, 1,205 dan, Wuhu coarse indica rice 250 dan, Du indica rice 19 dan, Bu indica rice 940 dan, thin rice 50 dan, white japonica rice 45 dan, and rice shops transported and sold 1,772 dan, plus 50 bags. As for the market trend, it is the same as in the past, with no changes. There is also little fluctuation in flour. The vegetable oil market has a shortage of goods and a thousand yuan increase, while soybean oil has plenty of goods and the price is fair. Soybeans are still in a sluggish state, and soybean cakes in Shantou are slightly picked up, and the market price has risen by one to two hundred yuan. At noon, it turned sluggish, broad beans were mediocre, raw peanuts were flat and tired, bran was sluggish, and the price was slightly lower by one to two hundred yuan. Mung beans were not selling well, and the market was depressed. The digestion of wheat outside the port was rare, and the situation softened.</p>
<h3>Rice Shipments from Sichuan</h3>
<p>The volume for July can be increased to 30,000 tons</p>
<p>Three million shi of grain from Sichuan are being shipped to aid Hunan, Hubei, Nanjing, and Shanghai. Due to a shortage of ships, the planned monthly shipment of 10,000 tons of rice has been difficult to achieve as scheduled. It is now known that the authorities are increasing the dispatch of ships to expedite the transport, paying particular attention to the Sichuan River section. On the Chongqing to Yichang section, more than ten ships, large and small, of the Minsheng Shipping Company have already been mobilized. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiang He, Jiang Qing, and the China Navigation Company's Hua Yuan, Hua Tong, and the China Merchants Union Steam Navigation Company's Xie Xing, as well as the Hopuson Steam Navigation Company's Chang Hong, Chang Zheng, and the Dada Steam Navigation Company's Jiang Kang, have all been requisitioned to transport grain along the Yichang to Chongqing section. Next month, we will receive 15 landing craft from the US, which will also be added to the use on that section. It is said that starting next month, the volume of rice shipments from Sichuan can be increased to 30,000 tons, and it is estimated that the transportation can be completed by mid-August.</p>
<h3>Wuhu Rice Price Remains Weak</h3>
<p>The rice price in Wuhu City once fluctuated sharply, but after efforts from all sides to stabilize it, it has stabilized. The current rice prices in Wuhu City are: machine-milled rice at 36,000 yuan per shi, cooked rice at 31,000 yuan per shi, and unpolished rice at 30,000 yuan per shi.</p>
<h3>Public Bond Prices Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Government bonds continued to decline slightly yesterday, with trading still sporadic. Activity was slightly better, but the overall trend remained unchanged, with limited fluctuations. Unified Class C bonds had a high price of 800 yuan and a low price of 700 yuan, a difference of no more than 100 yuan. Miscellaneous brands were even more sluggish, and the result was a further slight decline for all bonds.</p>
<h3>Broadcloth Sales Not Bad</h3>
<p>The broadcloth market remained stable yesterday. Except for summer goods, which were declining due to seasonal factors, the rest of the market was in a state where prices could not rise or fall. This was because production and inventory were extremely low. Only a few types of American goods, such as women's broadcloth and gabardine, were available, leading to a strange phenomenon where sellers were bullish and buyers were bearish. Fine wool yarn woven into robe material and suit broadcloth in plain colors, four-stripe patterns, herringbone, square checks, tan, dark gray, blue, green, and cyan were all negotiated and traded yesterday. This was because there was a lack of circulation in the market, and sales would soon be activated.</p>
<h3>National Medicine Trading is Sparse - Hand-Cut Slices Alone Shine</h3>
<p>The trading of both Chinese and Western medicine is sporadic, so the market rarely prospers or declines. However, hand-cut slices alone shine brightly. This is because the inventory is exhausted and it is the sales season, so all parties have an urgent need. Those holding the goods consider them a rare commodity, leading to a gradual price increase, reaching as high as around 7,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Gradually Increase - Current Cotton Delivery is Quick</h3>
<p>The yarn market was even firmer yesterday. Large Double Horse brands were firmly positioned at around 1.58 million, with little change from the previous day. However, small and medium-sized 20-count yarns were in high demand, with prices rising by 20,000 to 30,000. This was because the price difference with Double Horse was too large, so there was a tendency to gradually rise. 42-count two-ply and 32-count single yarn still made no progress. At noon, Fang Jian opened the yarn market as usual, with prices similar to the previous period, but 32-count Blue Phoenix single yarn was marked down by 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York American cotton telegram showed an intensified upward trend, rising another 50 to 55 points per pound. The near-term price was US$31.03, the long-term price was US$31.20, and the middling spot price was US$31.66. The local spot cotton market had quick sales at good prices. Because the end-of-month settlement was approaching, some manufacturers were preparing to close their accounts and were unwilling to take many actions, so trading was not as strong as the previous day. Only the Xinsheng Yarn Factory purchased 400 bales of ordinary middling cotton, with prices still 2,000 to 3,000 yuan higher.</p>
<h3>Central Government Exerts Pressure - Gold Price Falls Slightly Compared to Previous Close - Hong Kong Dollar Arbitrage Trading Still Active</h3>
<p>Raw gold advanced to a high price of over 2.05 million yesterday. The central government exerted some pressure, and the market stabilized. The opening price was flat, but demand exceeded supply after the opening, and speculative funds continued to be active. The market rose to around 2.05 million before feeling the pressure, and the upward trend was blocked. After 10:00 AM, the central government allocated 113 gold bars at a price of 2.025 million. The market began to decline after 10:00 AM, and many parties felt disappointed, causing buying interest to fade. Near noon, the price briefly fell below the 2 million yuan mark, but only temporarily. At noon, it struggled above 2.01 million. In the afternoon, credit tightened, and the selling frenzy resumed. Panic spread throughout the financial community, and the price fell back to around 1.98 million. As a result, it closed 42,000 lower than the previous close. Jewelry gold was at 210,000, and both silver bullion and silver dollars were flat. The unofficial overnight interest rate was slightly tight, with interest rates ranging from 15% to 18%.</p>
<p>Foreign currency, especially US dollars, remained weak. Although it was pushed up by the gold price to 2,740 yuan after the opening, it was only temporary and soon softened. As the gold market declined, it retreated to around 2,690 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, the gold market fell further, making the situation even worse. As a result, it closed 60 yuan lower than the previous close, with the arbitrage spread at around 744 yuan for every ten taels. Hong Kong dollar arbitrage trading remained active, but because the market had been close to 600 yuan for several consecutive days, buyers in yesterday's market paused slightly at the high price. As a result, it still rose by 10 yuan. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers were at 560 yuan, Indian remittances were at 690 yuan, and British remittances were at 9,000 yuan. Transactions were mostly in Indian remittances, while US dollar exchanges remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Impact of Closure at End of June - Large-Scale Selling of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were mostly traded until yesterday due to the closure at the end of the month. The increase in overnight interest rates triggered a selling frenzy, and many parties closed out their positions frequently. At the highest points after the opening, Yongxing Yarn was at 552 yuan, Mei Ya was at 3,500 yuan, Jingfu was at 238 yuan, Xinguang was at 250 yuan, and Qin Yu was at 200 yuan. They gradually declined, and all were at low prices at noon. Lesser-known small and medium-sized stocks were also affected. As a result, Yongxing Yarn and Mei Ya closed half a percent lower, while the declines for the three smaller hot stocks like Jingfu were limited. Lesser-known small and medium-sized stocks fell by around half a percent. Yuanlao stocks remained flat, and the asking price was lower after the close.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were affected by the same factors as Chinese stocks. Many short positions could not be sustained and were closed out, making it difficult to sustain high prices. However, large institutions absorbed the stocks after the prices fell, so they remained relatively stable. At noon, the market turned around. Ewo Yarns went up to 10,300 yuan, British American Tobacco was at 9,500 yuan, and Ewo Brewery was at 2,300 yuan. They were soon suppressed by the release of shares. Ewo Yarns retreated to 9,100 yuan before recovering slightly. As a result, Ewo Yarns and Steel each fell by more than half a percent, Ewo Brewery and Wheelock rose slightly, Asia and British American Tobacco fell slightly, and Yeguang Paper remained flat.</p>
<p>China Underwear held its shareholders' meeting yesterday and adjusted its capital from puppet currency 100 million yuan to legal tender. It also issued a dividend of one fen per share and a bonus of one fen per share.</p>
<h3>Chinese Tea Cannot Be Exported - Mainly Due to High Costs</h3>
<p>[Our reporter] Yesterday, I visited a tea industry insider to inquire about the recent export situation of Chinese tea. According to him, the prospects for both domestic and foreign sales of tea are bleak. Domestically, the largest market for tea in the past was the Nine Eastern Provinces. Currently, tea merchants are mostly taking a wait-and-see attitude due to the unstable situation. Recently, tea from various places has been concentrated in Tianjin, but it has not been shipped out of customs to the northeast provinces and cities, so the price of tea in Tianjin has also fallen sharply. As for the prospects for Chinese tea exports, given the current situation a month ago, there is really no way to recover. This is because after years of war, the general price level in our country has risen successively by about 5,000 times. However, the general price level in the United States and Britain has only risen by 30%. The ratio of price increases is too far apart. As a result, Chinese tea, which was once known for its low price and high quality, has become a luxury item in the eyes of foreigners. Although the United States and Britain have a great need for Chinese tea, they really feel unable to meet the price. Therefore, it is hoped that the government authorities will find ways to subsidize Chinese tea exports in order to save the precarious situation of Chinese tea.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Tea - British Merchants Send Personnel to Purchase - A Considerable Quantity Already Available</h3>
<p>Recently, Jardine Matheson and Dent &amp; Co., two British trading houses in this city, in view of the high tea prices in Shanghai, which are difficult to accept, heard that the production area in Fuzhou is both cheap and suitable. Therefore, they have all sent personnel to purchase. According to industry sources, a considerable quantity of black tea has been produced, at about 40,000 National Currency per dan. They all plan to pack and export them soon. As for the tea market situation in this city, the sellers of domestic tea are still stubbornly selling without budging, but the shops in this street, in view of the imminent arrival of the end of June, have reduced their appetite, resulting in a situation of both entry and exit being quiet. Transactions have become less colorful, and the situation remains stable and unchanged. However, Taiwan black tea and bud tea, as well as Wuxi and Yixing tea, continue to be popular, and the market atmosphere is still being boosted.</p>
<h3>Design Committee for Imported Goods - Already Starting Operations in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our reporter] When foreign exchange was opened, the central government stipulated the establishment of a Design Committee for Imported Goods, under the Supreme Economic Council, as a consulting body for reviewing import and export goods. After the return of the capital, considering Shanghai as the economic center of our country, it was planned to move the committee to Shanghai. It is now known that this matter has been realized. The chairman is Li Gan, who has come to Shanghai from Beijing to preside over everything. The location is on the top floor of the Central Bank on the Bund. After the establishment of the committee, it will conduct practical research on import and export materials. The committee will also hire many experts to participate in the work. The statistical expert Sheng Zhuosan has already been recruited by the committee.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Sharp Rise in American Cotton - Price Control Bill - Senate May Pass It</h3>
<p>[Reuters News Agency, New York, 28th] Yesterday, the price of cotton in New York was very high. The reason is that the Senate may pass the Price Control Bill. After the passage, the President will sign it. According to the bill, after it is officially established, cotton will become a "free" trade commodity. The opening price was quite stable, but in the afternoon, it rose sharply. It is estimated that about 325,000 bales were traded yesterday.</p>
<h3>交涉倫昌棧單</h3>
<p>持單人推定代表</p>
<h3>Negotiations Regarding Lun Chang Warehouse Receipts</h3>
<p>Representatives Designated by Warehouse Receipt Holders</p>
<p>The Cotton Cloth Association convened a meeting of all holders of warehouse receipts of cotton cloth issued by the British Lun Chang Dyeing Factory to discuss negotiation strategies regarding the dispute over the warehouse receipts. This was reported in this newspaper yesterday. Yesterday, the association held a meeting attended by 94 units of warehouse receipt holders, as well as Wang Xiaowen, the association's legal advisor, and others. Chairman Dong Jiufeng presided over the meeting and reported on the progress of the submission and negotiation of this incident since it was discovered in mid-December of last year. After discussion of the negotiation strategies, it was resolved to agree to the apportionment plan proposed by the association and to designate Chen Guoliang, Wang Tianshou, Ding Zhaolan, Bu Zongdao, Dong Jiufeng, Cao Zhexi, Chen Zhenhua, Chen Baoxin, and Zheng Weizhang as representatives of the warehouse receipt holders to negotiate with the Lun Chang Factory and request delivery of the goods by all the warehouse receipt holders.</p>
<h3>Although Native Sugar Arrives in Shanghai One After Another - Spot Sugar Market is Tight</h3>
<p>[Our reporter] The China Merchants Bureau's Hai Wan ship arrived in Shanghai from Shantou the day before yesterday, carrying more than 1,700 bags of sugar. In addition, the Yan Yue ship transported more than 3,200 bags of sugar from Xiamen to Shanghai. Both have been unloaded yesterday. However, the sugar market continues to rise rapidly due to the shortage of spot goods. The Association's quoted price for spot medium-grade white sugar initially opened at 117,000 yuan, then rose to 120,000 yuan and 119,000 yuan. Fifth-term warehouse receipts were at 113,000 yuan, and roadside goods were at 100,900 yuan to 8,000 yuan. A small number of early shipments were quoted at 100,700 yuan. Numbered goods opened with more than 100 baskets of Xinghua red sugar at 115,000 yuan, 100 packages of Diaoxing sugar at 100,000 yuan, up 2,000 yuan, and 80 packages of Huanggang Qing sugar at 100,250 yuan. The market is temporarily lacking a rising trend.</p>
<h3>Summary of Business Conditions</h3>
<p>Lumber: The price of fir continues to rise unabated, the price of Lauan plywood is also improving, and the remaining goods are consistently stable.</p>
<p>Ramie: Due to sluggish sales, the price is in a stagnant state. Ramie shipped from other ports to Shanghai has high transportation costs and very high costs. Traders cannot raise the purchase price, so few goods arrive.</p>
<p>Wild Silkworm Silk: Arrivals have been scarce recently. The reason is that transportation is not smooth on the one hand, and Shanghai prices are still low on the other, failing to attract foreign ports. Insiders speculate that the prices of various wild silks will be raised recently to facilitate export sales.</p>
<p>Butter: As an industrial oil produced in the summer, industrial users are competing to purchase and store it due to seasonal factors. Since January, the price has more than doubled. Yesterday, the market asking price reached 135,000 per dan, but only a small amount of goods could be bought.</p>
<p>Asphalt: The price has also risen sharply. The reason is that the price of butter has risen, and asphalt has followed suit. In addition, the price at the place of origin is similar to that in Shanghai, and it is also difficult to transport, so the price is difficult to stabilize.</p>
<p>Straw Mats: The peak sales period has passed, resulting in a very stable market situation. Only soft mats, due to the high demand for car seat cushions, have seen a rebound in sales and a slight price increase.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Exports 7,000 Tons - Pre-War Average Reached 700,000 Tons Annually</h3>
<p>[Our reporter] According to the person in charge of China Vegetable Oil Factory, tung oil has always been one of our special products for foreign trade, but production has decreased sharply in the past eight years due to the impact of the war. In Zhejiang, the output is only three-tenths of the pre-war level. In Sichuan, it is only seven-tenths of the pre-war level. It is expected that it will take at least three years to restore to the pre-war production state. As for the export volume of tung oil in our country before the war, the annual average was about 700,000 tons. During the war, exports were in a stagnant state. After the victory, tung oil exports gradually became active again. However, at the beginning, it was only a few hundred tons per month. Recently, it has increased to more than 2,000 tons. According to statistics, since the victory, the number of tung oil exports in our country has reached about 7,000 tons.</p>
<h3>Two Types of Domestic Products Listed - Sprayers ... Bicycles</h3>
<p>According to authoritative sources in the Western medicine industry, the most imported Western medicines this month are penicillin and various sprayers. There is now a domestic DDT automatic sprayer, with a beautiful design and extremely strong spraying power, reaching a maximum height of more than ten meters, which is very suitable for apartments, hotels, and restaurants. It is said that the sprayer is produced by Nanyang Pharmacy.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Machine Factory of the Resources Committee, its First Factory on Tangshan Road, manufactures bicycles. It is reported that the factory has produced more than 1,000 wrench-brand bicycles since July, with a selling price of 180,000 yuan per bicycle. It is reported that the factory is currently purchasing various raw materials from abroad, and once they arrive, it will be able to produce in large quantities. The Second Factory, located in Zhabei, is currently manufacturing diesel engines.</p>
<h3>Hangfu Sawmill</h3>
<p>Tobacco Factories Invest in Organization - Self-Operated Wooden Boards for Cigarette Boxes</p>
<p>Tobacco Factory Invests in Self-Operated Wooden Boards for Cigarette Boxes - The amount of board required by larger tobacco factories in this city is substantial, so a large tobacco factory plans to construct their own sawmills in Fuyang and Hangzhou, Zhejiang in order to obtain cigar boxes directly. It is expected that the manufacturing of these boxes will take place in two locations with factory pieces. Most of the tobacco factories may take part in these investments.</p>

<h3>Visiting Veteran Revolutionary Chu Fucheng - A Model for Striving for Democratic Public Opinion</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>Hangzhou, 25th Dispatch</p>
<p>When "democracy" is being used by people as a front, and true democracy is fading, this reporter remembers Mr. Chu Fucheng, a veteran revolutionary who has fought for democracy all his life. Mr. Chu's life can be described as a model representative of democratic public opinion in China. From his participation in the National Assembly in the early years of the Republic of China to his current position as a National Senator, he has always and everywhere represented true public opinion.</p>
<p>Imprisoned for Opposing Yuan - Imprisonment for Two Years</p>
<p>In the fourth year of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai concluded the Twenty-One Demands, an unequal treaty with Japan. Mr. Chu was in Peiping at the time and did his best to oppose it. Later, upon learning that Yuan Shikai was attempting to fulfill his dream of becoming emperor, he spoke out and resolutely opposed it. As a result, he was placed under house arrest by Yuan, who insisted that he support the imperial system. He still vehemently opposed it. Yuan immediately sent troops to arrest him, originally planning to send him to a mountainous area in Zhejiang for imprisonment, but because Mr. Chu was from Zhejiang, he was afraid that he would be treated favorably, so he was sent to Anhui for imprisonment, where he endured two full years in prison. However, he was not discouraged and continued to fight. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Chu, in view of the increasingly deteriorating state affairs, went south to Guangdong and organized an Extraordinary National Assembly. Mr. Chu was elected Deputy Speaker of the Extraordinary National Assembly, and the Father of the Nation was elected Extraordinary Generalissimo.</p>
<p>Hates Cao Kun - Withdraws from the National Assembly</p>
<p>In the twelfth year of the Republic of China, the members of the National Assembly elected the president. At that time, Chu Gusheng was a member of the House of Representatives. The shameless Cao Kun wanted to rape public opinion by bribing members of the National Assembly to elect himself as president. At the time, Mr. Chu resolutely opposed it and publicly attacked him in the parliament, believing that at a time when democracy was just beginning to sprout, it was truly heartbreaking to be so ravaged by Cao Kun. Therefore, Chu Gusheng did not participate in the election and announced his withdrawal from the National Assembly. Later, in view of the increasingly weak country, the increasingly corrupt politics, and the people in deep water, while those in power still fought for power and plunder, he went south again to participate in the Northern Expedition. He returned to his hometown and presided over the Zhejiang government for a period of time, but ultimately he held the spirit of appealing for the people and returned to the people. From the sixteenth year of the Republic of China to the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, during this long period of time, he ran a school in Shanghai. In the twenty-sixth year, he followed the capital to the southwest, working for the country and striving for the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Two Matters Appealed for on This Trip South</p>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance, Mr. Chu only arrived in Nanjing by boat from Chongqing in May of this year, then from Nanjing to Shanghai, from Shanghai to his hometown of Jiaxing, and then from Jiaxing to Hangzhou. He had not been home for eight or nine years. Returning to his hometown and witnessing the devastation of the countryside after being ravaged by the enemy and puppets, he felt infinite emotion. One afternoon near dusk, this reporter visited Mr. Chu in a small car on Qingtai Road. I saw that he was thinner than when he was in Chongqing, but his spirit was still very strong, and a firm and unyielding expression was expressed in his wide-open eyes. He told the reporter that this trip was not for sightseeing, but for two things: one was that the conscription of military grain in Jiaxing Pinghu seemed to be too heavy, so he wanted to visit Chairman Shen and appeal for a reduction; the other was for the land tax in kind. He understood the significance of the government's land tax in kind, and he approved of the principle of land tax in kind. However, due to some sporadic problems with the land tax in kind, such as storage, transportation, weights and measures, and quality, there were many abuses in the past. He now hoped to find ways to eliminate them. Therefore, he wanted to talk to Chairman Shen on the one hand, and to consult with Mr. Zhu Xianwen, the Speaker of the Zhejiang Provincial Provisional Council, on the other hand, to find a way to solve these problems.</p>
<p>Fundamental Problems - Restoration and Economy</p>
<p>Stroking his beard, he said: "It is up to people to make things happen, and problems can always be solved!" This was a very positive tone. I asked casually: "What do you think of the problem of the negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party?"</p>
<p>"I think there is a way." Again, a positive tone. He continued, "When we look at something, we have to look at it in a way that there is a solution. As for the problem of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, I see that the government is tolerating and conceding everywhere. The Communist Party does not actually want war, and with Marshall mediating in the middle, I think an agreement on cooperation will eventually be reached."</p>
<p>"To be honest, if you ask any ordinary Chinese citizen, who still wants a civil war? Since the people do not want a civil war, then whoever starts a civil war is violating public opinion. Now the Communist Party is using force in the Northeast and the Su Wan border areas, causing the people to flee, which is truly painful and full of complaints. This, along with the government's improper reception of personnel at the time of victory, is equally in violation of public opinion and the loss of popular support, and perhaps its seriousness is even greater than the situation of the reception officials at the time."</p>
<p>"I believe that the fundamental problem at present lies in how to solve the current economic problems. If we have to fight again, the economy will really be on the verge of collapse! Now the people are at a point where they are exhausted and in unbearable pain, and we really cannot add the pain of war to the people again!"</p>
<p>"This time, on the issue of military reorganization between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the Communist Party insisted on its own views, and the Kuomintang also believed that this was the minimum limit. It is difficult to negotiate, right?" The reporter mentioned this problem again.</p>
<p>"The military reorganization plan is not difficult to solve. The entire principle of military reorganization was decided in January. I am very confident that Marshall will have a more just handling of the issue of garrison areas. I also trust Marshall very much!"</p>
<p>The Third Party - Must Be Just</p>
<p>He also said: "I hope that the attitude of the third party will be impartial, without being selfish. It must truly stand on a just standpoint and speak, only in this way can there be good fruits of unity, and only in this way can there be a real opportunity to express democratic public opinion." After Mr. Chu finished these words, he still held an optimistic and positive attitude. I saw that he was so young and lively in spirit, and I was reminded of the scene of him waving his fist and giving a great speech at the Jiaxing Public Sports Field lecture hall in my childhood. I really didn't expect that he was already seventy-four years old.</p>
<p>Although his body has been weakened a lot by the experience of years of running around and fighting, the few visible and bony shoulder bones are very strong and hard.</p>
<p>Our small car had arrived in front of No. 54 Yingshi Road, where Mr. Chu was temporarily staying. The reporter got out of the car and said "Thank you!" Mr. Chu told the reporter: "I will go back to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 27th. The future of the country is still optimistic!"</p>
<h3>A Record of the Eighth Air Force Group Going to Japan</h3>
<p>— Zhu Minwei</p>
<p>The Eve of Departure from Shanghai</p>
<p>On the evening of June 18th, at the Shanghai Air Force Club, after the Eighth Air Force Group hosted a banquet for the former Group Leader, Commander Xu Kangliang, and Director Chen Jiashang, officers and their dance partners mingled and danced on the smooth floor of the ballroom. Section Chief An Xijiu sat down at our table.</p>
<p>"You are scheduled to leave the day after tomorrow, do you know?"</p>
<p>His "the day after tomorrow" meant flying to Tokyo on the 20th. The reporter had obtained permission from General Zhi Rou of the Air Force Headquarters to fly to Tokyo once and had been waiting in Shanghai for the flight for more than ten days. Hearing that the departure date was imminent, I was naturally happy.</p>
<h3>Commander Wang Dancing So Enthusiastically</h3>
<p>I have always held a favorable impression of all the personnel of the Eighth Squadron. Although I am also acquainted with Squadron Leader Wang Shi, we haven't spent much time together. My understanding of his character and personality comes only from what others have said, so I can't claim to know him well. It was only after hearing Section Chief An say that Squadron Leader Wang himself was going that I understood why he was dancing so enthusiastically with his wife in the ballroom tonight.</p>
<p>His wife, Xie Manzhen, is a dental student in the Huaxi Dam area of Chengdu, full-figured and slender. Her serene face and quiet demeanor create a beautiful appearance. Squadron Leader Wang, due to his service in the Air Force and his involvement in actual combat, only met Xie, fell in love, and married her when he was appointed Squadron Leader of the Second Air Force Squadron at the late age of thirty. After their marriage, people said their relationship was very close. My several meetings with Squadron Leader Wang had all been in military camps. Tonight, the welcoming glance he gave me was so lively and cheerful. I suddenly felt that this wasn't a thirty-five-year-old Air Force Lieutenant Colonel and commander of a small army of two thousand men, but a young pilot, trying to reclaim the youth lost in the war years, and a fine pilot in love with a young, beautiful girl.</p>
<p>This evening, I finally met Major Liu Yizhi, whom I had long wanted to meet. Yizhi is from Zhenhai, Zhejiang, tall in stature and speaks Mandarin with a strong Zhejiang accent. In the years of combat, in addition to his general officer duties, he was able to use his passion to consider many issues related to the Air Force from the perspective of the Chinese Air Force, and he wrote down many systematic ideas. A booklet titled "Silver Camouflage" can be said to be a small wave in the sea of his thoughts.</p>
<p>Someone at my table asked:</p>
<p>"Isn't Commander Wang's wife and several other wives dancing very well? Why isn't Mr. Qian Zuren dancing?"</p>
<p>"Commander Wang is leaving the day after tomorrow, who would want to interrupt their marital bliss?"</p>
<p>**Strong and Resolute - Major Liu Stays Off the Dance Floor**</p>
<p>People always sympathize with those who are about to part, especially after the cruel realities of war, people cherish emotional life even more. Major Liu Yizhi's attitude towards life is largely due to becoming quite strong and rational in the wartime environment. It's not that he couldn't learn to dance in China, but he feels that there are more things that require mental and physical effort, so he didn't devote his energy to it. During his year in the United States learning to fly the B-24, it wasn't that he couldn't learn to dance, but he was too busy absorbing the high-level scientific spirit of America, and wrinkles appeared on his face. He finally gave up the joy of dancing. He said:</p>
<p>"I'll learn it slowly." I suddenly thought of a fundamental problem in the construction of the Air Force.</p>
<p>"What do you think is the fundamental problem in building the Air Force?"</p>
<p>"Machinery!" He replied very directly and without hesitation, and then added:</p>
<p>"In terms of flying, we can say that as long as there is training, there is no problem at all. For example, during the eight years of the War of Resistance, Chinese pilots could learn any type of aircraft as long as they studied it. Now Chinese people can fly both B-25 and B-24 aircraft, and they can also fly P-40, P-38, and P-51. However, aircraft in the world are improving day by day. The aircraft we painstakingly learn to fly have already become antiques in other countries. Once an international war breaks out, antiques cannot compete with new weapons. In an era of international peace, if you don't have strength, a balance of power cannot be established, and you will inevitably fall behind and be unable to keep pace. To solve the fundamental problems of Air Force construction, we must establish a corresponding foundation in machinery."</p>
<p>Amidst the soft and enchanting sounds of the club's band, we watched dance after dance, and the conversation couldn't go too deep, so we just chatted about this and that. I know these young people know a lot because they often hang out in the world's big arenas, watching other people's displays of power, and have many feelings. To wish them a smooth round trip to Tokyo, I also happily went to the dance floor and danced for a while.</p>
<p>Airport Scenery</p>
<p>Shanghai's second largest airport is in Dachang. The Eighth Air Force Squadron is stationed near this airport. The barracks used to be the Japanese Air Force barracks, with low, small bungalows and small rooms. It's a bit small for working and resting inside. But if you look back at the Chengdu Taiping Temple military camp, the Lanzhou new military camp, and the Pengshan military camp in Sichuan, where the Eighth Squadron was stationed in the past eight years, you won't feel uncomfortable. In the Dachang military camp, the officers gather the most during mealtimes. These bachelors, who haven't started families, eat and talk on the white tablecloth-covered tables, laughing and joking.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 19th, I went to the Dachang military camp to meet Deputy Squadron Leader Peng Nian and Squadron Adjutant Chen Jinghu, among others. After dinner, I went to see Medical Officer Liu Xigong. He talked about the group medical services for two thousand eight hundred people in the summer, such as spraying DDT, vaccinating all personnel and their families against cholera, and treating about seventy soldiers a day. Unknowingly, we started talking about the entire Air Force medical system. He mentioned the design work of the Air Force Officer School Hospital in Jianqiao, Hangzhou. His opinion is that Air Force medical services must be fundamentally established to support flight operations, otherwise flight operations will be impaired. Although Medical Officer Liu is in the Eighth Squadron, his ambition and broad-minded personality often lead him to think about the overall situation.</p>
<p>Flight Preparations - All Progressing Gradually</p>
<p>Heavy rain poured down in the evening, and I missed my family very much. Emotions often fluctuate in my heart, but I am used to suppressing them. On the morning of the 20th, after getting up, I packed my luggage and borrowed a Japanese map from the 33rd Squadron, and then took a car to Dachang Airport. The rain had stopped, and the concrete runway of the airport was dry, but there was still water accumulated on the grassy areas outside the runway. The sky was covered with heavy rain clouds. I met Xiao Qiang, the Eighth Squadron's meteorologist, and went with him to the flight management office to check the weather. I learned that from Shanghai to the Japanese mainland, the sea route was covered with clouds and fog, and the clouds were very low, less than a thousand feet high. The cloud layer was twenty thousand feet thick. If clouds could be used as a material, the storage today would be astonishing. The wind speed was twenty miles per hour, blowing northeast along the route. Captain Wang Guonan had gone to the Jiangwan US military base early in the morning to obtain weather forecasts and fill out flight permit forms. The aircraft was already prepared, aircraft number 485, parked next to the taxiway near the management office. The head of the resident representative delegation to Japan, Zhu Shiming, and his twelve staff members, also arrived by car one after another. Squadron Leader Wang Shi also arrived. All flight preparations were completed, waiting only for pilot Wang Guonan to return from Jiangwan.</p>
<p>Yang Huai borrowed a parachute for me. I hadn't been near this thing for more than a year. Because it was an ocean flight, I also found a life preserver. Yang Huai put it on me and taught me to pull the two black bakelite handles when using it, which would immediately fill it with gas. Inside, a half-pound bag of white powder was sewn into the interlayer. When a patrol plane passes over the sea location where one is drifting, pulling open the powder bag will cause the seawater to turn the white powder into a large cloud of white smoke, attracting the attention of people on the plane to discover this lonely person in desperate need of rescue.</p>
<p>With a Swoosh - Our Plane Starts Moving</p>
<p>I squeezed into the six-foot square radio room between the cockpit and bomb bay of the B-24. In this small space, on the left were the fuel gauge, heater switch, and instruments for controlling the machinery. On the right was the radio operator's desk. In this small room, there were also Delegation Leader Zhu Shiming and four female typists, myself, and 34th Squadron Maintenance Chief Lieutenant Xu Shulin, Communications Officer Lieutenant Chen Gongjun, Navigator Lieutenant Huang Eryi, and eight people in total. Squadron Leader Wang was sitting on the right side of the cockpit, and Wang Guonan was sitting on the left side. The aircraft door was located under the belly of the plane and was controlled by a switch. After everyone boarded the plane (the other seven passengers were in the rear gunnery compartment), the corrugated aluminum door clanged shut. After this, the fate of everyone on the plane was in the hands of the pilot.</p>
<p>Maintenance Chief Xu Shulin was standing behind the two pilot seats in the cockpit. He had big eyes, a big nose, and a big mouth. He was of medium height, sturdy and strong. He paid attention to the cockpit instruments and listened to Squadron Leader Wang loudly reading the white words on the black board amidst the noise of the four engines. Each word represented every mechanism necessary for the aircraft to fly. This pre-takeoff check was like passing an important checkpoint. As Squadron Leader Wang read each item, Captain Wang Guonan would look at the instrument he was reading about. After these dozens of words were read and dozens of instruments were checked, Xu Shulin opened the skylight of the radio room, stuck his head out the window, and directed the aircraft to taxi to the runway. The aircraft's machinery made strange noises, "Woo-la," "Woo-woo-la." The aircraft was moving, and both Wangs held the steering wheel, turning left and right. Reaching the starting point of the runway, it was 9:15 a.m. The clouds in the sky were almost scattered in the low sky at a height of three hundred feet. Raindrops fell from the skylight where Xu Shulin was standing. This was when a storm was about to blow and heavy rain was about to fall at sea. The two Wangs began to take off. The silver B-24 left Dachang Airport in the roar of the engines, immersed in the vast white clouds and heavy rain. (22nd)</p>

<h3>Promoting the Construction of the Pudong Bridge</h3>
<p>Editor: According to reports, the Municipal Public Works Bureau is planning to build the following new facilities: (1) Twenty tunnels, (2) More bridges over the Suzhou River, (3) Elevated trams extending to the suburbs. This plan will greatly benefit the city's traffic. Since the victory, the number of vehicles in the city has increased greatly, but the streets are not very wide, and demolishing houses to widen roads is not easy to implement. Only by finding other good solutions can we make up for this. Major cities in Europe, America, and Japan have had this type of transportation infrastructure for a long time. I deeply hope that the Municipal Public Works Bureau will implement this plan as soon as possible. Now, I would like to suggest that another item be included in the plan, namely the construction of the Huangpu River Bridge, which has been mentioned once before. Building this bridge has at least the following five major advantages: (1) It will facilitate transportation and save time and money. (2) It will disperse the population to the Pudong area, avoiding excessive crowding in the city center. (3) By taking advantage of the lower land prices in Pudong, a large number of affordable housing and civil servant dormitories can be built, reducing the severity of the city's housing shortage. (4) Building the bridge will require a large number of construction workers, which can alleviate some of the unemployment problem. (5) It will develop Pudong's commerce and directly increase government tax revenue. Some bridge-building materials have also been shipped as part of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's aid to China. If the amount of this material is too small to be fully used, a request can be made to the China National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for additional assistance. As for all the costs required for construction, in addition to the government bearing some of it, the remainder can be financed by the city government issuing public bonds. It is expected that after the bridge is built, Pudong's commerce will greatly prosper, and tax revenue will also greatly increase. Even using the increased tax revenue to repay the principal in installments will not be very difficult. Respectfully submitted by Cao Junqing, June 11th.</p>
<h3>Extra Fees for Elementary School Graduation</h3>
<p>Editor: I am a student. For families like mine, it is certainly difficult for parents to pay for their children to go to school. My younger sister is studying in the sixth grade at the ×× Elementary School on the ground floor of the Cishu Building on Nanjing Road, and she will graduate this summer. Yesterday, my sister came home from school and told me that a female teacher in the school, whom the students call "Teacher's Wife" Sheng, suggested holding a graduation ceremony, and each student must pay 10,000 yuan as a gift. I was quite surprised to hear this! Schools sometimes hold graduation ceremonies, but why is money needed for gifts? So I told my sister, "We've already paid the second tuition fee, and we've paid all the miscellaneous fees. It won't cost 10,000 yuan per person to hold a graduation ceremony. To be honest, we can't afford it." But my sister cried and said, "The teacher said that if we don't pay, we won't be allowed to graduate, and we have to pay it all within this week." I had no choice but to comfort her. Sir, you are a person who cares about education. Is it really necessary to pay a price of 10,000 yuan to graduate? Respectfully submitted by Jin Shou, June 18th.</p>
<h3>Social Services - The Compassionate Heart of Old Man Qingxia</h3>
<p>Genuine Poor and Sick Can Apply According to Regulations</p>
<p>This column published a letter and the editor's response on the 26th regarding "Old Man Qingxia's Willingness to Provide Relief to Genuine Orphans, Widows, the Poor, and the Sick." The next day, we received a reply from Old Man Qingxia, who first sent 500,000 legal currency, instructing us to temporarily hold it, and allocate it appropriately. This column will certainly act in accordance with his wishes to fulfill the old man's compassionate heart of relieving suffering and rescuing those in need. We have formulated a set of simple rules, hoping that genuine orphans, widows, the poor, and the sick who are in urgent need can apply by letter. The main points of the old man's two letters and the interim rules are recorded below:</p>
<p>Respected Sir: I was deeply moved by your newspaper's response this morning. I would like to entrust you with full authority to handle the matter of assistance, and I am sending a check for 500,000 yuan for you to hold temporarily. If there are any applicants mentioned in the previous letter, please investigate carefully to ensure they are genuine and allocate the funds appropriately. I have always admired your newspaper's dedication to public welfare and its integrity and impartiality, and I am especially entrusting you with this matter. As for the relief methods, please also devise them on my behalf, so that those seeking help can directly receive practical benefits. My humble efforts are limited, and I hope you will not laugh at my meager wishes. I had planned to visit you in person, but I do not wish to appear, so I am troubling you. I am infinitely grateful for your kindness. Sincerely, Old Man Qingxia, July 26th</p>
<h3>Interim Rules for Old Man Qingxia's Relief of Orphans, Widows, the Poor, and the Sick, Handled by the Shen Bao Social Services Department</h3>

<h3>Responding to Readers</h3>
<p>Medical and Health</p>
<p>(1) Wang Fengdao asked about his late-stage eye disease that has left him blind for over a year. He originally planned to commit suicide to end his miserable life. (Note: Suicidal thoughts are unacceptable!) My mother is weak and my children are young, and they have no one to rely on. I have no choice but to temporarily provide some peace. If there are any kind gentlemen who are confident in treating this disease, please teach us, and the merit will be immeasurable. The course of the disease: He usually suffers from a deficiency of both the liver and kidneys. Several months before he became ill, he often lost his vision. At the same time, the area around his molars was swollen and painful, and he couldn't open his jaw. He had to stuff food in one grain at a time. After about forty days of this, he walked a hundred miles for two days for some reason, and was exposed to wind and dampness. The next morning, he felt chills and had a fever. On the third, fourth, and fifth days, he had a high fever, and his joints were sore and he couldn't move. That night, the whites of his eyes and eyelids turned red, he was sensitive to light, and felt a stinging pain like needles. When he opened his eyes, tears immediately flowed. The black pupils of his eyes were slightly yellow and somewhat cloudy. The pupils gradually shrank until they disappeared. On the sixth day, he could no longer see anything. It has been over a year since then, and there are now red streaks in his eyes, but no other pain. He can open and close his eyes as usual.</p>
<p>[Dr. Xian Yuqi, MD, replies] Based on the description you provided, it is likely that he has rheumatic arthritis, which has affected his optic nerves, etc. A thorough examination and study must be conducted before surgery or internal medicine can be used.</p>
<p>(2) Chen Huimin reads your column every day and feels that the doctors are prescribing medicines according to the patients' symptoms. To receive your guidance is so great and sacred! I take the liberty of writing to you to ask for your guidance, I am extremely grateful. (1) What medicine can cure nocturnal emission, and is there any hope of a full recovery? (2) What medicine can cure impotence and premature ejaculation, and is there any hope of a full recovery? (3) In addition to taking medicine for treatment and support, are there any other ways to help me? (4) If my body slowly becomes healthier, can these diseases gradually recover? (5) What kind of nourishing diet is the most economical and effective for supporting my body? (6) Should I abstain from smoking, alcohol, and other things? (7) Is Carnation milk powder or light soy milk better for nourishment?</p>
<p>[Dr. Gu Yuqi, MD, replies] (1) Lupulin and Cowp are very effective for nocturnal emission. The dosage must be prescribed and treated by a doctor. (2) Impotence and premature ejaculation can be treated with tonics to strengthen the body and blood, and various vitamin pills. At the same time, male hormones can be taken internally and injected. (3) (4) After the body becomes healthier, the disease will gradually recover. (5) Exercising and stretching are both ways to strengthen the body. (6) It is best to avoid smoking and alcohol. (7) Carnation milk powder is better, as soy milk is more likely to spoil in hot weather.</p>

<h3>Surplus Soldiers and Officers Cultivating Border Regions</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yangquan</p>
<p>Chengdu, 17th (Air Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Sichuan Provincial Government, recognizing that the climate and soil conditions in the border counties differ from those in the inland counties and are largely unsuitable for rice cultivation, recently convened a meeting of geologists and agricultural experts to study the utilization of uncultivated land and productive work in the border counties, as well as methods of development. Furthermore, many councilors of the Provincial Assembly proposed gathering and organizing the remaining officers and soldiers who were dismissed after the Wang-Zhang conflict, along with those aspiring to work in the border regions, and sending them to cultivate the wasteland in the border regions.</p>
<p>For the examination of army personnel studying in the United States, 84 candidates registered in the Chengdu region. After the first-stage qualification review, 30 were accepted; after the second-stage physical examination, 23 were accepted; after the third-stage English examination, 14 were accepted. The fourth-stage examination on military science and general knowledge has been completed and is currently being graded. It is uncertain how many will achieve "success on the imperial examinations."</p>
<p>The Kang-Dian Railway Surveying Team of the Ministry of Transportation's Railway Surveying Bureau, which has been surveying the Kunming-Xichang railway line for a month, has concluded that the route from Kunming via Wuding and Yuanmou to Xikang is too difficult due to the steep mountains and deep valleys between Wuding and Yuanmou, making construction nearly impossible. They plan to survey an alternate route from Kunming along the Dian-Mian Railway to Guangtong, then via Yanxing and Yuanmou to Xikang.</p>
<p>The Junlian County previously held a campaign to improve the treatment of soldiers, raising over 366,000 yuan beyond the original quota, which has now been entirely donated to Chengdu Lie Wu Middle School.</p>
<p>The Chengdu city government has finally resolved the long-standing issue of garbage removal. The city government has requisitioned 50 boats, with 5 operating daily, each carrying 7 tons. It is estimated that all the garbage can be cleared within 50 days.</p>
<p>Among the refugees from various provinces who came to Sichuan during the war, excluding those who have already returned home, there are still 92,093 people urgently awaiting repatriation. However, due to the lack of transportation, it is difficult to achieve this in the short term.</p>
<p>All universities in Chengdu have already begun their vacations, and secondary schools are now holding graduation ceremonies one after another.</p>
<p>The weather in the city has turned overcast, and "plum rain" falls frequently. After a rain, it is necessary to wear a lined coat to ward off this "summer cold." The streets are muddy, and pedestrians are complaining and blaming the heavens.</p>
<p>The drought in various counties of Sichuan Province has not abated, and disaster reports continue to flood the provincial government. The authorities have initially allocated 200 million yuan in relief funds as an emergency measure, pending the approval and allocation of the 1 billion yuan requested from the central government, which will then be used to reimburse the initial funds.</p>
<p>There are currently nine newspapers in Chengdu: Central, New News, Whampoa (Military Academy), New China (Youth Party), Chengdu Express, Southwest News, West China, New People, and Public Times (Democratic League). Evening editions include New People, Public Opinion, Chengdu, East, and West China, totaling five. This marks the most prosperous era in the past nine years.</p>
<p>The Sichuan Provincial Administrative Conference, which is normally held once a year, will be held in early July this year in Chengdu and Chongqing. The provincial government authorities will present plans for Sichuan's construction.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs has dispatched personnel to Guanxian to plan the Dujiang Power Plant project, which reportedly includes: (1) "Hanjia Dam Plant" located on the left side of the Dujiangyan Irrigation System. (2) "Ma Xi Power Plant" located upstream on the Min River. (3) "Pujiang Thermal Power Plant" located in the Yang River bend area, Huangwadian. The Dujiang Water and Electricity Plant project must first complete this thermal power plant to support the progress of the massive engineering project.</p>
<p>The Sichuan Provincial Construction Experimental Zone requires at least 60 billion yuan according to the five-year plan formulated by the provincial government. This is estimated at current prices, and does not yet include the impact of currency devaluation and rising prices.</p>
<p>Zhang Honghu, the county magistrate who passed this year's Sichuan provincial examination, and Wang Sunqing, the county magistrate assigned by the central government, are undergoing internships in the Secretariat and Civil Affairs departments during their waiting period for appointment.</p>
<p>In order to expedite the delivery of newspapers, the Western Sichuan Postal Bureau is planning to add newspaper and express mail delivery runs from 10 PM to 12 AM, allowing the Chengdu-Jiajiang, Chengdu-Ya'an, Chengdu-Guanxian, Chengdu-Pengxian, and Chengdu-Zhaojue lines to read the newspapers as early as possible.</p>
<p>Due to strict enforcement in the urban area, opium dens in Chengdu City have recently infiltrated the riverbanks. Recently, someone opened an opium den on the sand dunes beneath the Shiniu Weir east of the city, and it was discovered, leading some to praise it as a "floating opium den."</p>
<p>The provincial government has announced that the counties in Sichuan Province with the highest cotton production in each major river basin are: in the main stream of the Yangtze River, Fengjie, Jiang'an, Hechuan, Wushan, Wuxi, etc., totaling 18 counties. In the Min River basin, Renshou, Yibin, Jiajiang, etc., totaling 15 counties. In the Tuo River basin, Rongxian, Jianyang, etc., totaling 14 counties. In the Fu River basin, Suining, Shehong, Santai, etc., totaling 11 counties. In the Jialing River basin, Nanbu, Bazhong, etc., totaling 11 counties, for a total of 55 counties.</p>

<h3>Peace of Mind and Rational Tranquility</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>A lame person does not forget shoes, and a blind person does not forget sight. A person with a physical defect is also prone to psychological imbalance, and so it is with psychological fears of various kinds.</p>
<p>A superficial example can be illustrated by the use of sunglasses. There are many unrelated women who, regardless of whether it is sunny or cloudy, whether indoors or outdoors, always wear them. While some of them certainly believe that "this is fashionable," most are probably afraid of showing their faces to others!</p>
<p>Former Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke, a Japanese war criminal who turned his hands to clouds and covered them with rain on the international diplomatic stage, has recently died of illness at Tokyo Imperial University Hospital. Before surrendering, he wrote a short poem, the gist of which was: "I don't blame heaven, I don't blame others, I walk down the dark road."</p>
<p>Tong Chengde, the owner of Feida Securities, who defrauded 120 million yuan, will find an opportunity to talk to that socialite after arriving at the detention center, telling her not to admit to hiding US dollar bills and bonds in her home, or that his crime is beyond reproach.</p>
<p>Matsuoka and Tong Chengde are of very different statuses and their actions are very different, but their psychological panic is the same, so they ultimately unwittingly revealed their "inner thoughts."</p>
<p>Speaking of this, it will again involve the debate of the inherent goodness or evil of human nature. Honestly, everyone is always seeking peace of mind and rational tranquility. The reason why there are no secrets in the world is that everyone is pursuing peace of mind and rational tranquility. Do not think that those who have seized undue enjoyment by illegal means are powerful and enviable, but in the deepest part of their souls, their pain cannot be painted over by cars, foreign houses, women, and gold bars. And the reason why this society has not completely fallen into a state of cannibalism, deception, and inhumanity is that there are some people with peace of mind and rational tranquility, and there are some people who regard peace of mind and rational tranquility as the common goal of life.</p>
<h3>Eating Dog Meat</h3>
<p>— Fang Jun</p>
<p>Dog meat is a meat that Guangdong people particularly enjoy, although it is said that there are also Guangdong people who do not eat dog meat; however, those who do not eat dog meat in Guangdong, unless they are older women, or men who have a reason not to eat it, can be said to be as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. In Guangdong, dog meat, in another context, is considered a supreme delicacy unless it exceeds a certain age. The so-called exceeding age also means that if its age exceeds three years, it is not suitable for consumption, hence the saying, "Old dog, tender kitten, eating it to death no one will know." As its age increases, the meat becomes poisonous, like pufferfish, eating it is fatal; but pufferfish, as long as it is cooked properly, is not a major problem, but old dog is not the case, its harm is so great that even those who love to eat dog meat turn pale at the mention of it.</p>
<p>The cooking of dog meat in Guangdong people has a special skill, able to cook various dishes with different flavors, and some can even cook it into nine different dishes. However, the most common cooking method is braising in soy sauce, mixing with Gulao fermented soybeans, ginger, oil, wine, sugar, etc., placing it in a clay pot on a charcoal stove, cooking and eating at the same time, some also add aconite, or black beans, and finally add green vegetables. Its taste is rich and delicious, and it also has a "fragrant" taste, so it is also called "fragrant meat." Fragrant meat is common among the people of Guangdong Province, especially during the summer solstice and Chongyang Festival, which are indispensable foods. There are people in the folk who use dog meat to entertain new guests. When I returned to my hometown eight years ago, some elders specially invited me to a dog meat feast. However, eating dog meat in the countryside cannot be done at home, mostly in orchards, under large trees, or in the suburbs, I don't quite understand the reason for this, but women avoid it like the plague.</p>
<p>Guangdong people not only have a special fondness for dog meat, but also regard it as a tonic. For example, if someone suffers from long-term malaria and is cured, in the two weeks to a month after recovery, dog meat is used as a nourishing food, it is said that it not only nourishes the body and strengthens the original qi, but also prevents malaria from recurring. Whether this is true I do not know, but every villager holds such a view. However, this is a very common situation, if a Guangdong person, apart from the above, does not eat dog meat in a year, they always consider it a regret, more urgent than the demand of those who have suffered from malaria.</p>
<p>I originally didn't like dog meat very much, although when I returned to my hometown, some elders invited me to eat it a few times, but I only tasted it a little, not daring to eat much, so the elders thought that my constitution was not good because I didn't eat enough dog meat. They said, "Yellow dog nourishes the spleen, black dog nourishes the kidneys, if the spleen and kidneys are strong, where does weakness come from? Where does disease come from?" I didn't dare to agree with their theory, although every villager emphasized it so strongly. However, since I was scared by a dog three years ago, I have hated dogs even more, and I have eaten more dog meat. The first is hate to the point of "eating its flesh," to the point of eating the same kind of animal that is like a human but not a human - the owner.</p>
<p>There are many places to eat dog meat in Hong Kong, all hidden under the names "36" or "Fragrant Meat", because there is a ban on slaughtering. But this ban is only a formality, the slaughterers slaughter on their own, and the eaters eat openly. The dog meat stalls only hide the word "dog", so there is no need to hang up a sheep's head, and diners will naturally come when they hear about it. However, the dog meat at these dog meat stalls is mostly soaked in mung bean water first. Dog meat soaked in mung bean water becomes much thicker, but the fresh and fatty taste is much worse, not as delicious as homemade. Homemade is inevitably too much trouble, it takes half a day to satisfy one's craving. Moreover, the slaughterer must be invited in advance, otherwise, even if you have a steel knife in hand, you may not necessarily become a "dog butcher."</p>
<p>The taste of dog meat is very different from that of pork, beef, and lamb, and it is oily but not greasy, especially fragrant, so that people can smell it from a distance when cooking.</p>
<p>Guangdong people do not eat any dog without exception, but they also have their choices, so there is a saying: "First yellow, second black, spotted white is worse than none." This means that yellow dog meat is the best (nourishes the spleen), black dog meat is the second best (nourishes the kidneys), and spotted or white dog meat is worse than none, because it does not nourish the spleen or the kidneys.</p>
<p>Guangdong people in Shanghai don't eat much dog meat, they all say, "Shanghai is a Buddhist land, eating dog meat will kill people." So I lived in Shanghai for twenty years and never saw a Guangdong person slaughtering a dog, but maybe I just didn't see it. As for the saying "Shanghai is a Buddhist land", it is especially absurd.</p>

<h3>Officials Have Two Mouths: The Top One Says Yes, the Bottom One Says No</h3>
<p>— Feng Yi</p>
<p>To be an "official" is to be born with two mouths, the top one says yes, and the bottom one says no. Wearing a big hat, they have absolute freedom of speech.</p>
<p>The best way to save food is to eat more "vitamin pills," "cod liver oil," "Klening milk powder," and "Florida oranges."</p>
<p>A foreign friend praised the art of Chinese people eating, "believing that using knives and forks still has some primitive era meaning, the Chinese use chopsticks, relying only on five fingers and two small sticks, they can do everything, which has reached the peak of human evolutionary history, this is obviously evolution, is civilization!" Whenever I hear the words evolution and civilization, I can't help but be surprised, not knowing whether it is flattery or sarcasm?</p>
<p>Foreigners are still anxiously worried about the serious economic problems caused by high wages and high prices. But we importers are thinking of this as a good opportunity to fish in troubled waters and make money. If it weren't for "high wages, high prices," how could foreign goods be sold?</p>
<p>"To have a way to control traffic, you must eliminate rickshaws," "To eliminate rickshaws, you must first use motor vehicles," so in the near future, a large number of buses and a large number of jeeps will participate in driving, I hope that from now on, traffic control will be as orderly as expected, and chickens and dogs will be at peace!</p>
<p>During the Pacific War, the US military relied on flamethrowers to annihilate the stubborn Japanese troops on Iwo Jima. Unexpectedly, the US military stationed in Tianjin from Iwo Jima still had to rely on flamethrowers one day, and used them to annihilate the locust plague in the military food city. The same weapon, the former can kill people, the latter can save people, this is the only difference between "war and peace"!</p>
<p>According to a Nanjing telegram: "The Buick sedan that President Sun Fo uses to travel usually has license plates with four number ones, which is quite eye-catching. It is heard that this car was a property received from the enemy and puppets, and was given to the president by Mayor Chao Jun." This makes people think of some sesame seed green bean officials, who are so capable, much more capable than the president. As the saying goes, "Mountains are not high, but immortals make them famous," this is true!</p>
<h3>Seal Language: Composition</h3>
<p>— Gao Tianxin</p>
<p>Composition, that is, layout, that is, arrangement, that is, studying how to match characters. Within the square inch, what is stored is refined, and what is contained is broad. The effort is no less than making a painting of one and a half feet. It is a small world. There are four methods for carving seals: seal script method, brushwork method, composition method, and knife method. Among the four methods, I think the composition method is the most important. Why? Because painting and calligraphy have large bodies, while seals have small bodies. Therefore, the brushwork of seals can be sloppy, and the knife method can be vigorous. All three of these cannot be done alone, only the composition method has its own unique skills. A good composition is a beautiful seal. The beauty or ugliness of a seal is entirely related to the composition, and the reason why a seal can be playful is also the playful composition. And the most difficult thing about seal carving is to first obtain the composition, and the works of those whose composition is detached from vulgarity, unusual, beautiful, and artistic have rarely been made without having put in a lot of effort. As for the source of good composition, the first is to see more original rubbings of good seal manuals, and the second is to have talent. Original rubbings of good seal manuals are very expensive, how can poor seal carvers and craftsmen afford to buy them? How can they buy them all? Therefore, a class of wealthy and bored literati regard the works of seal carvers as rare commodities, only I am the greatest, and expert seal carvers are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Alas, talent is to know the gains and losses of an inch in the midst of sparse and dense arrangement, to understand by intuition and not to be expressed in words, but the two must be combined to have a basis, and then it will be wonderful.</p>
<h3>Eating the Five Directions: A Monk's Entourage</h3>
<p>— Wang Yingyuan</p>
<p>In a corner, there exists such an organization, and many people rely on this strange income to maintain their livelihood.</p>
<p>It turns out that there are many temples and monasteries near that place, and of course there are some monks in them. These monks usually do not abide by the monastic rules and are constantly indulging in wine and meat all year round. Every spring, they form gangs to go to neighboring provinces to beg for alms, and the income is quite rich, enough to squander for a year. It turns out that these bald men, although not "orthodox", are still considered to have "qualifications". Later, it expanded.</p>
<p>Probably every one or two formal monks is a unit. First, in nearby villages, they invite three or five ignorant farmers to be attendants and form a small group. Each person has a full set of robes, led by the monk to set off for alms. All expenses are planned and advanced by the monk, and the attendants' wages are given by the monk at his discretion. The attendants' tasks are probably to carry luggage during the journey, and to recite scriptures along the street day and night when stationed, which is quite hard work, while the monk stays at home. After the recitation work is completed, the monk and the attendants go to each household to beg for alms together, and the income is of course good.</p>
<p>Later, "fake" goods increased day by day, and almost every adult man in every village set off in disguise every year. But the amount of "real" goods is limited, and not every group can have them, so every group became a group of all "fake" monks. If the whole set of costumes and props cannot be prepared in advance due to poor economic ability, there is another kind of person who has emerged, that is, renting out props, collecting a certain amount of rent every month, so the renter has a life.</p>
<p>Most of these monks are illiterate. Being able to recite a sentence of Amitabha Buddha or write a bill is considered the leader. They printed many pictures of famous mountains and scenic spots. But in fact, where do so many real mountains come from? So they racked their brains to imagine the earth mound behind the house as having pavilions, towers, waterfalls and mountain peaks, and asked someone to paint a landscape painting, which looks like Penglai Immortal Island. They also have documents such as the origin of repairing a certain famous mountain or a certain hall. This is prepared for distribution or pasting at the destination. Then each group sets off one after another, going to various provinces and regions. After arriving in a place, they first visit the township mayor and give gifts such as ham. Except for one person staying at home, the rest are responsible for an area, wearing a full set of monk's robes, carrying a Viidu statue and knocking on a wooden fish, reciting Amitabha Buddha. Probably once during the day and once at night, rain or shine. They have to pass through forests and fields in the middle of the night, and it is unlucky if they encounter wolves. Three days later, the township chief and the security chief will go to each household to ask for donations. It is said that the situation has been very good recently, and most of them pay in cash immediately. Those who donate one or two thousand yuan usually put it in their pockets, and those who donate more than tens of thousands of yuan can leave their names in the donation book. This lasts for about four or five months, and they return home fully loaded. It is said that based on this year's living standards, after deducting expenses, each person can get hundreds of thousands or more than one million yuan.</p>
<p>They traveled far and wide because the countryside was poor, and it can be said that they exchanged a little reward with their sweat and blood. From a certain point of view, those Buddhist disciples are willing to donate, and it can also be considered compassionate to save these people.</p>
<h3>Glass Counter</h3>
<p>— Mo Chi</p>
<p>Those stalls that are now scattered on the sidewalks in various districts, moving as cars and static as counters, this kind of open-air transaction is not born by chance. This batch of glass counters was born in Shanghai during the period of its occupation. At that time, there was "air defense" every night, so citizens who were active on the road at night all had a hard, tight thing by their side - a flashlight. Therefore, the business scope of these glass counters is mostly "electrical materials", "cigarettes" and "candies". After the victory, these glass counters once had "no place to use their skills" and were shelved for a long time.</p>
<p>Since the U.S.A. goods have arrived in Shanghai in large quantities, these glass counters have reappeared on the streets. At present, the Shanghainese who claim to be fashionable are all "American equipped". Look, they are wearing "anti-Japanese glasses" with glass legs, and instead of inserting a "Parker" gold pen in their pockets, they are wearing a glass comb. They are wearing glass belts. If it rains, they are wearing a glass raincoat. It is regrettable that the stinking skin of this flesh and blood body is not "Flashy's" "imported goods".</p>
<p>These glass counters like to concentrate their transactions. This is to cater to the convenience of customers' choices, such as clothing stores on Shilu Road and medical stores on Sima Road. Therefore, the area near the Daxin Company and the central section of Lin Sen Middle Road are the base camps of glass counter merchants. As for whether the price is cheap, unfortunately, I am ignorant and use domestic products, so I cannot introduce the price of American goods. I am very sorry.</p>
<p>Brief Collection of Comments</p>
<h3>Simplified Procedures, Adjusted Treatment</h3>
<p>— Wu Lingren</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Bureau issued a notice, roughly saying that "In order to increase the speed of express registered mail, the procedures for handling this type of mail will be simplified on a trial basis. Please do not send checks, red tickets, postal money orders, or stamps in express registered mail to avoid losses in the event of an accident." Reading this makes people suspect that after the handling procedures are simplified, there will be an increase in the danger that our express registered mail cannot be delivered.</p>
<p>After the typhoon landed, it suddenly turned into a low pressure, and Shanghai was spared from being attacked. People who are concerned about the current situation are also hoping that the current situation will suddenly turn into a low pressure like this fragrant typhoon, and dissipate invisibly. Wouldn't that be great?</p>
<p>The authorities will reduce the treatment of staff of state-owned enterprises and agencies; the salaries and allowances of senior staff of China Textile Corporation will be reduced from 700,000 yuan to 400,000 yuan. This is of course a very reasonable method. I am only afraid that after removing an allowance item, another item will be added, and the result will still be a reduction without a reduction.</p>
<p>The Hangzhou District Procuratorate illegally detained Da Tong Daily reporter Hu Cangsu, which aroused public indignation. As a result, the High Court sent a letter to the "Support Association" expressing regret and anxiety. This case is finally coming to an end. The judiciary must maintain its dignity, and the news must strive for freedom, but if it ignores the principles of justice, then there is no talk of "maintaining" and "striving." The Zhejiang High Court's arrogance before and humility later ignored this point and suffered the consequences.</p>
<p>The Wuhan Headquarters summoned several Japanese officers, police officers, and soldiers for testing, and most of them did not admit to criminal behavior. The Japanese people's thinking and attitude are still the same today, and we should really pay attention.</p>

<h3>Yellow River Flood Diversion Area Blocking Project</h3>
<p>— Our reporter Xu Shou Lian photographed</p>
<p>The Huayuan口 (Huayuankou) on the banks of the Yellow River, since the breach in the 27th year [1938], has, after years of erosion, expanded to 1,460 meters. Since the victory of the War of Resistance, the government has recognized the immediate need to prevent Yellow River disasters, and ordered the Yellow River Conservancy Commission to plan the project of blocking the breach and restoring the dike. At the same time, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), in order to assist China's relief efforts, dispatched technical personnel and transported large quantities of materials to assist our government, in order to restore normalcy as soon as possible. Under this joint cooperation, we finally officially started construction on March 1 this year.</p>
<p>This is, of course, a very difficult project. Although manpower is not a problem, it can be solved by using work-for-relief to solve the lives of displaced people, but because of traffic disruptions (various materials shipped from Shanghai to Zhengzhou cannot reach their destination without a long time, and at the same time, the materials transported each time are so scarce.) In addition, the Communist army obstructs it everywhere, and until now, the section of the project planned to excavate a diversion canal in the lower reaches of the old course is still under negotiation, and it cannot be smoothly advanced according to the original plan. Millions of refugees along both banks of the river are still in dire straits and cannot be rescued.</p>
<p>After four months of continuous work, most of the breach blocking project has been completed. This time, our reporter set off with the Shanghai press corps for an inspection. When we arrived at Huayuankou on the 20th of this month, the earthen embankment completed on the West Dam Beach was about 1,000 meters, and the East Dam was also 60 meters. The 400-meter breach in between, because the water flow is turbulent, so first, pile and build a temporary bridge, and then throw stones on the bridge to fill the gap. Recently, this project has entered the stage of throwing stones, and it will soon be able to block and close the gap. Huayuankou, in the past, was originally a small town and not very prosperous. Now, with the sudden increase in staff, reaching tens of thousands of people, it has become a lively town. They often go to entertainment venues such as "Lotus Drum" and "Henan Storytelling" during their spare time to seek happiness in suffering in order to seek spiritual comfort. The following photos were taken by the reporter during this trip. They are specially published in the weekly pictorial so that readers can also understand the root of the Yellow River breach blocking and dike restoration project.</p>

<h3>Poem of Reason</h3>
<p>— Yu Wen</p>
<p>We have browsed through the famous works of poets, ancient and modern, and found that in addition to the differences in schools, styles, etc., there are two types of essential differences in poems: "lyrical" and "reasoning." The former is "valuing writing," while the latter is "valuing use."</p>
<p>Some literary critics believe that poetry can only be lyrical, and reasoning is not poetry. Yuan Mei of the Qing Dynasty advocated spirituality in poetry, did not abandon verification, and quoted Confucius's two sayings, "Emotions should be sincere, and words should be skillful," to emphasize his own position. Mi Dao Songnan's "Amusing Words" also commented on Cihu's poems: "The style of poetry and fu should be recited with lingering charm. Cihu's poems are like a few arguments from a moralist. Reading them is stiff and awkward. Those who do not understand poetry..." and so on. Generally speaking, once poetry enters reasoning, it inevitably becomes serious and falls into bitterness and astringency, losing its light and agile charm, and there is no talk of "the pen falls like wind and rain, and the poem moves ghosts and gods to tears."</p>
<p>However, some critics strongly advocate that poetry should "have something to say" and should "reason"! In order to achieve the purpose of "enriching human relations, beautifying education, and changing customs," poetry must be reasoning. Ge Hong's *Baopuzi* says: "Ancient poems criticized faults, so they were beneficial and valuable; modern poems are purely concerned with praise, so they are harmful and cheap." This school of poetry critics further regards lyrical poems as boring idle talk, believing that there is no need to waste ink writing them at all. Cheng Yi of the Song Dynasty said that someone did not write poetry, not that he was forbidden to write, but that he did not want to write such idle words. "Now when talking about poetry, it is like Du Fu, such as saying: 'Butterflies deep in the gorge flutter through flowers, Dragonflies gently skim the water,' Such idle words, what is the point of saying them!"</p>
<p>In all fairness, lyricism is the superior quality of poetry, and reasoning is also one of the styles of poetry. If you read poetry like Li Cheng's "Mountains are like the longevity of the benevolent, and water is like the purity of the sage," you will feel that it is too heavy in Neo-Confucianism and has no emotional appeal. However, in the poems of great Chinese and Western masters such as Qu Yuan, Du Fu, Swinburne, and Wordsworth, there is no shortage of works that are simple in reasoning and concise in narrative. The ethical value of those works is not overshadowed by their artistic value. Thus, it can be proved that poetry can still "reason" in addition to "lyricism"!</p>
<p>Although there are occasional authors of reasoning poems in recent times, there are few fine works. I remember that in the past, I and a group of friends rushed to the Northwest and Southwest hinterland to engage in educating the public. At that time, Mr. Chen Lifu remotely sent a poem saying -</p>
<p>China values education, Ritual and music are its wheel, Changing customs is valued, Transforming the people lies in loving them, The poet asks the bell, To ultimately achieve the purity of Zhou and Nan, Strive, young men, Plow and cultivate without fear of hardship!</p>
<p>This poem has events and things, and reading it does not feel awkward. The poetic interest is between intention and unintentionalness, and it is not without emotion. It can be cited as a good example of a reasoning poem.</p>

<h3>Mildew (Novel) (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Zhong Yuan</p>
<p>The yellow plum rain is heavy, with moisture in the wind. The walls, desks, chairs, blackboards, books, and even the clothes on your body and the chalk in your hand feel wet and sticky, as if they have just been taken out of a steamer.</p>
<p>After writing the new words of the third lesson on the blackboard, Feng Zengshou could not bear the heat any longer. He took out a tattered handkerchief to wipe the sweat on his forehead, turned around, and slapped a "Fuxing National Language Textbook" on the podium a few times, shouting to the dozens of noisy students:</p>
<p>"It's so hot, what are you yelling about? Quiet! Quiet! Copying new words doesn't require your mouth, doesn't require your mouth!"</p>
<p>The classroom was indeed quiet for a moment. However, in this silence, Feng Zengshou's eyes suddenly touched something - a small official hat folded from green oiled paper, placed squarely on the right corner of his podium.</p>
<p>Feng Zengshou's pale temples suddenly turned red. Although he had been teaching for fifteen years, he was usually quite tolerant of elementary school students. But at a glance at this thing, he could no longer restrain himself. With a "bang" he hit the desk, rushed over, grabbed a student sitting next to the podium, and shouted sharply:</p>
<p>"Who? ... Who? ... It must be you again ... It must be you again ..."</p>
<p>That student's name was Zhang Kangyuan. Only thirteen or fourteen years old, but his two black, shiny eyes already looked very cunning. Being grabbed by Mr. Feng, he was not afraid at all. Because he knew that his father, Zhang Yilin, was a big man in the area and a school director. Even the headmaster's job was in his father's hands, so what was there to be afraid of?</p>
<p>Zhang Kangyuan was not afraid of Mr. Feng. He sat there nonchalantly, even making faces at the people next to him.</p>
<p>"You! ... You! ... You insult the teacher! ..." Mr. Feng was furious, his voice trembling, "You stand up for me, ... stand up! ..."</p>
<p>Zhang Kangyuan did not stand up, but looked at Mr. Feng's face with bulging veins and softly called out "green hat"!</p>
<p>"Little devil! You're crazy! ... You dare to insult and scold the teacher! ... I'll drag you to see the headmaster ... I'll drag you to see the headmaster! ..."</p>
<p>But like every time, Feng Zengshou's anger rose to the point of "going to see the headmaster" and then suddenly died down. The reason for this was not because Zhang Kangyuan's father was a big shot and a school director, and he was afraid. In all honesty, if it wasn't Zhang Kangyuan, the school director's son, who was messing with him, but Zhou Xiaomao, the school janitor's son, he wouldn't really go to see the headmaster either. Although that kind of insult was even more painful than stabbing his heart with a sharp knife, no matter how angry he was at the beginning, in the end, he would at most grab the small official hat made of green oiled paper from the table, throw it hard into the corner, as if throwing all his shame away, and then it would be over.</p>
<p>Today, Feng Zengshou seemed to have thrown all his shame into the corner again. He walked out of the classroom covered in chalk dust and saw Yang Keren, the dean of studies, standing outside in a suit. He quickly put on a smile and called out: "Good morning! Lao Yang!"</p>
<p>Yang Keren replied "Hmm", but did not call him "Lao Feng", nor did he smile. Instead, he seriously looked at his watch and asked him: "Do you have a class next period? I have something to talk to you about."</p>
<p>Although Yang Keren was young, his memory did not seem to be very good. It was clearly he who had arranged the curriculum. He had assigned Feng Zengshou 35 periods a week. Except for one period on Saturday afternoon, the remaining five days were so packed that even an ant couldn't crawl in. Where would there be any free time to talk?</p>
<p>Therefore, it was not until after school in the afternoon that Feng Zengshou patted the chalk dust off his body and walked into Yang Keren's office.</p>
<p>The weather was still so hot and stuffy. Feng Zengshou saw that Yang Keren had taken off his light gray suit jacket, revealing a snow-white silk shirt, and he was actually a little envious. But in an instant, his attention shifted from the white silk shirt to Yang Keren's face, and his heart jumped violently.</p>
<p>He saw a cold air on Yang Keren's face, and his voice was also cold:</p>
<p>"Mr. Feng, in principle, your age and experience are greater than mine. I shouldn't be the one to say this to you, but for the sake of the school's reputation and the students' future, I seem to have to say it ... have to say it! ... Recently, it seems that your reputation is not very good, especially ... your wife ..."</p>
<p>Feng Zengshou kept wiping the sweat on his face with that tattered handkerchief. Hearing the words "your wife," he clearly felt his heart beating wildly, but it was beating too lightly, not enough to resist the cold arrows that Yang Keren continued to shoot out of his mouth.</p>
<p>"Yes, my wife is not very well-behaved. But that doesn't have much to do with teaching, does it?" Feeling that he really couldn't bear it, he said to Yang Keren, just this one sentence.</p>
<p>"How can it not have much to do with it?" Yang Keren said in a serious tone: "Like this morning, I walked past the sixth-grade classroom and didn't hear any reading, but they were dealing with some green hat, red hat stuff. That kind of situation not only ruins the school's reputation, but also wastes class time. It really is ..."</p>
<p>Yang Keren launched into a long speech about "it really is". Feng Zengshou sat there, listening quietly, without moving or responding, like a log.</p>
<p>In the evening, the sky was dark and gloomy, filled with unpleasant dampness.</p>
<p>Feng Zengshou went home like a log.</p>
<p>Everything was the same as usual, the door was locked, and after opening it, there was a mess at a glance; the cabinets were piled with colorful clothes, and the bottom of the bed was piled with colorful shoes. The table was piled with colorful rouge, powder, combs, washbasins, scented soaps ...</p>
<p>Eyes full of colorfulness, eyes full of dimness, but one thing was always neat and clean, which was a small desk placed by the window. On it, there was a stack of his favorite books, the medal he received when he graduated from normal school, and a photograph taken ten years ago when he and his wife honeymooned in Hangzhou.</p>
<p>He silently walked to the desk, silently sat down, and silently sighed.</p>
<p>For several months, almost every afternoon when he came home, he would sit in front of the desk like this. He seemed to regard this desk as his only friend. Any fatigue, any pain, as long as he sat down at this desk, would dissipate silently.</p>
<p>But today, the situation has changed! He sat in front of the desk for nearly half an hour, and the fatigue and anger in his body were still weighing heavily on him. He stared wide-eyed at the books, medals, and photos on the table, hoping to get some comfort, some encouragement, and some understanding from these beloved things, as usual; but it was no use, everything had changed today!</p>
<p>Changed! All he could see in front of him was Yang Keren's cold face!</p>
<p>"What a joke! This kid who still smells of milk dares to lecture me!" He almost shouted it out, and a hand clenching a fist almost slammed down on the table. But he didn't dare to shout, didn't dare to hit. He remembered that the kid who still smelled of milk had given a cold laugh at the end:</p>
<p>"Hehe! Mr. Feng! Don't be angry! We're all just working together, so let's talk frankly. Of course, I would never tell Principal Li, please rest assured!"</p>
<p>What a cunning fellow! He even brought out the principal to scare him! Bah! What if you tell the principal? Can the principal swallow him in one bite? ...</p>
<p>He gritted his teeth. But he only gritted his teeth. He didn't even dare to make a "buzzing" sound like a mosquito in his throat. He knew that the principal couldn't swallow him in one bite, but the principal had a more terrible power than swallowing him in one bite - he could starve him to death!</p>
<p>"Starve to death ... starve to death ... starve to death ..."</p>
<p>He painfully repeated these four words. He asked himself: Am I so afraid of death? Of course not necessarily! But he really didn't want to die yet, especially to starve to death. He couldn't say the reason, and he didn't dare to think about it. He only often felt many inexplicable fears and threats around him, making him very timid.</p>
<p>It was getting dark, and he was still sitting at the desk. Bright light shone in from the windows of the house opposite, and under the light was a young housewife, smiling, standing in front of the table arranging dinner.</p>
<p>As if it were a kind of stimulus, Feng Zengshou didn't want to see this scene and reached out to pull the blue cloth curtain.</p>
<p>Darkness surrounded him, and he was a little afraid, so he rested his head on the desk. Not long after, his wife came home.</p>
<p>A mildewy night. Dark, damp, and desolate.</p>
<p>It was past 10 PM. His wife had long fallen asleep tiredly. But Feng Zengshou was still reading under a dim yellow oil lamp.</p>
<p>No, he wasn't really reading, he was looking at his wife.</p>
<p>He had to admit that his wife was beautiful. Even though she was over thirty, she was still as fair and rosy as a virgin. He also had to admire his own methods at the time, being able to win her heart among four or five male colleagues who were pursuing her.</p>
<p>However, did he find happiness in marrying her?</p>
<p>He could count on his fingers that he was happy for only thirty days, the thirty days of their honeymoon in Hangzhou. After that, he gradually realized that a beautiful woman was like a beautiful goldfish, which should be kept in a sophisticated glass tank and placed on a delicate mahogany frame. He also realized that love was not an indestructible steel or stone, but only a delicate plant that needed to be constantly cultivated with fertilizer and water to bear fruit and blossom; otherwise, it would wither and die immediately.</p>
<p>He remembered that in the first few years, the world was at peace, and being an elementary school teacher was not worried about hunger and cold, so his wife could barely endure it. Later, the world fell into chaos, everything changed, and his wife changed.</p>
<p>But he didn't blame her. He knew he was too poor to support her. He was even very grateful to her. Because sometimes she would still come back to give him a little comfort, lean into his arms and call him "poor child," then take out a stack of banknotes and put it in his hand, saying in a coquettish voice: "You've made yourself look like a beggar, go buy a new long gown!"

<h3>Chapter of Depression (II)</h3>
<p>— Hu Shanyuan</p>
<p>The Depression of Writers</p>
<p>All people have an upward spirit. If it is not a last resort, and to willingly degenerate, this is rare. As a leader of the intellectual community, the writer is willing to write out their maxims and beautiful articles, in order to treasure them in famous mountains and pass them on to future generations, or to awaken the deaf and inspire the society. They themselves are already so willing, and if there is encouragement from readers, they are of course even more willing.</p>
<p>But what use is their willingness! They write dutifully, writing with conscience, not appealing to people's base emotions, not selling gimmicks. Once an article is sent out, the editor of the publication shakes their head. The more polite ones say that this kind of empty talk and ideals are out of touch with the times and not what is needed. They are sorry and cannot publish it, and it is returned to you. The impolite ones do not even bother to look at it because they have what they think is needed. They simply discard your work in the wastepaper basket. Or they may still take a look, but the result is still that they put you in the wastepaper basket without giving you a word! The original manuscript of the book is sent out, and you think that it has been written with much effort and painstaking care. While its content cannot startle the heavens or make the ghosts weep, at least you can look up and not be ashamed of heaven and look down and not be ashamed of people. However, the editor of the publishing house, after seeing it, still shakes their head and says that the cost is high now. If a book goes out and cannot get to its second or third edition, the principal and profits will not be recouped, so no one dares to take the risk to lightly have it typeset. After typesetting, they lightly put it on the shelves to be printed. Of course, these publication editors and book company directors will also use a good intention to advise you on what kind of works they need. You debate with them, saying that some works that can be used as spiritual food should be published. They either flatter you a few times, keeping the ghosts and spirits at a distance, or they avoid the topic and talk about something else, ignoring you!</p>
<p>What will you do? You can only cry out in depression. You are condemned by readers, and you feel very embarrassed. You want to stick to your principles, but there is no way to implement your principles. You want to change your tune and join the mainstream, but you still have a conscience, and you are unwilling and cannot bear to. At the same time, perhaps you make a living by writing. You cannot help but write, and you have to seek the next best thing and reconcile yourself. Naturally, you can only avoid writing hard-line propaganda and soft-line entertainment, and instead write some harmless commercial works. Even when writing commercial works, you cannot escape depression, because after all, this is not what you want to write.</p>
<p>The readers do not understand you, and you cannot ask the readers to understand you. You can only be depressed! The editors do not understand you even more, and you cannot ask the editors to understand you. You can only be even more depressed! The readers' demands are right, and you do not blame them. The editors' views are wrong, and in addition to depression, you naturally only have to express your anger to the editors and criticize them.</p>
<h3>Setting Sun</h3>
<p>— Zhong Yuan</p>
<p>I stood on a desolate mountaintop. The breeze gradually tightened. Birds gradually returned. Thick clouds gradually piled up from the east. A round, tired evening sun retreated into the corner of the western sky, falling, dimming, quickly sinking into the dark evening mist.</p>
<p>"Night is coming!" I said this, my heart very calm. But in an instant, a beautiful afterglow appeared:</p>
<p>A pale red sphere jumped out from the corner of the western sky, emitting thousands of strange lights, flying out golden flames, silver halos, red flowers, and purple stars.</p>
<p>The sky was bright: clouds fluttered, stars jumped!</p>
<p>The mountain top was bright: tree shadows swayed, green grass rippled!</p>
<p>But in just one minute, the afterglow was gone, and everything returned to silence. Dark sky. Black mountains. Unknown birds cried softly on the branches.</p>
<p>The real night had just begun.</p>
<p>"Night is coming!" I said this again, but my heart was jumping.</p>
<p>"Night is coming!" I said this again, my heart was still jumping.</p>
<p>"Night will inevitably come!" Finally, I said this heavily, but my heart could never be calm.</p>
<p>Friend, this is what I want to complain to you about: Why, when you took your last breath, did you have to emit thousands of strange lights, and use trembling fingers to hold onto your friends, and say to them, "I love you, I can't forget you!" Instead of coming brilliantly and leaving quietly, letting your friends have a little peace?</p>
<p>Extended Serial Novel</p>
<h3>Double Flying (68)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Lihua was about to go on stage. Before going on, she stood at the curtain of the stage entrance and gazed at the audience below. Initially, her heart instinctively leaped, but she quickly calmed down. She deftly used a kind of "willing to die for a cause" mentality to steady herself! She thought: Even if this stage were a guillotine today, she would obediently accept her death for the sake of her birth mother! If one is not even afraid of "death," what else is there to fear? She also thought: She goes on stage to sing, singing for the many people below; entertaining them; it's the same principle as her birth mother and her master who taught her opera, having her learn it to earn money for them. Therefore, from now on, she would only take the attitude of appeasing her birth mother and her master; to "appease" these many people below the stage. She regarded performing on stage as fulfilling her obligation to these many people, just as she initially regarded learning opera as fulfilling her "obligation" to her birth mother and master.</p>
<p>Thus, when Yinghua heard the Zhengde Emperor on stage calling out "Xiao Bao," she immediately responded "Here!" from within, and then gracefully and slowly walked out. She sang and performed freely, without looking at the audience below once. She was as if in a deserted place, skillfully and brilliantly completing the first page of her painted-face career!</p>
<p>The entire audience applauded thunderously, everyone marveling that this was a child prodigy descended from the heavens!</p>
<p>Mrs. Mo, Second Mrs. Weng, and Zhang Xian all sweated for Lihua! They were all overjoyed!</p>
<p>"How is it? Boss Shi! Was I wrong? A 'gua-gua' calling voice, 'gua-gua' calling acting, see? In less than two years, she'll definitely be 'headliner'! 'Headliner'!" Zhang Xian boasted to Shi Yulou, while picking up Lihua and holding her high, with a hint of challenging Shi Yulou.</p>
<p>"This child is truly destined to eat this 'open-mouth meal' [perform on stage], strange! Why isn't she even a bit timid on stage?" Shi Yulou said, looking at Lihua with amazement.</p>
<p>"There's nothing 'strange'! Still one sentence: Zhang Xian's disciple, no mistake!" Zhang Xian raised his thumb.</p>
<p>"All thanks to the master's good teaching, that's why we have today!" Mrs. Mo also complimented Zhang Xian.</p>
<p>Everyone was happy for Lihua's success. Even Lihua herself, she was not only not jealous because Lihua was better than her, but also proud because Lihua received praise! She was truly a simple and lovable child.</p>
<p>But only Lihua herself was unhappy. When she heard Shi Yulou give his verdict: saying that she "is destined to eat this open-mouth meal," she almost cried! Because she thought that she would have to "fulfill her obligation" in this way forever; forever "relieving boredom" for everyone, forever "earning money" for others! However, what did she get for herself? False praise, humiliating glory. Thinking of this, she couldn't calm down now! She hastily removed her makeup; left the backstage, which was like a living hell; returned home; didn't eat anything; didn't even take off her clothes; burrowed into the quilt and sobbed uncontrollably! She clutched her little chest and cried out: "I'm only ten years old, how much longer do I have to live like this? Papa! Papa! Where are you? Hurry up and save me! Take me to your world! I can't take it anymore!" She devoutly prayed for a power to transcend her, but this power could not be given by the deceased Mr. Mo, although Mr. Mo loved her very much when he was alive.</p>
