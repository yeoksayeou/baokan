<h3>專機接回漢口三人小組　馬使重視中原戰火陳周等五人昨舉行會談</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕政府代表陳藏·王世杰·邵力子與中共代表周恩來·董必武五人，今日下午在瑯琊邵寓再度聚會，至七時始出。據聞談話內容仍為收復區行政權問題，雖經記者多方探詢，雙方意見均未透露一字。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕（參攷訊）頃據有關方悉：馬帥對返國述職一事已在攷慮中，並聞返國後將與杜魯門總統商討對華政策，唯聞馬帥於返國後將仍再度來華。又傳聞行將行覆新之美國駐華大使司徒雷登，可能為馬帥圻裏地位之第二人。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕中共代表團原定今日下午四時招待記者，報告中原戰事，現因不及凖備，改於明日下午四時在梅園新村辦事處舉行記者招待會。屆時將由重調部駐漢口第九小組中之中共代表鄭紹文少將出席報告。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕馬歇爾特使為明瞭中原戰事相起見，特電邀軍調部駐漢口之第九執行小組美方代表何柱堅上校，政府代表慮濟時少校，中共代表鄭紹文少將，及駐宣北化店之第三十二執行小組美方代表白羅索中校，政府代表李桂流中校，中共代表任仕舜來京，以便於聽取三方代表報告後，進行調處。現三方代表已於昨日午後三時二十五分乘馬使之專要抵京，何柱堅，白羅索已晉見馬使，報告共軍中原軍區李先念部由平漢鐵路西竄，沿途與國軍發生衝突經過甚詳。聞馬使於聽取美方代表報告後，尚擬探詢政府與中共對於中原戰事之意見，然後再決定辦法，着手調處。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十日電〕以歇爾特使今日轉移其和平談判目標，而致力於撲滅日益滋張之戰火。自危急之鄂北區域召回第九執行小組，聽取緊急報告。</p>
<h3>司徒雷登博士　任駐華大使　杜魯門巳正式宣佈　我朝野一致表歡迎</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕美總統杜魯門九日在華盛頓宣布，任命司徒雷登為美國駐華大使，並不影響馬歇爾特使在華之工作，此項消息傳至首都後，馬歇爾特使於今午發表談話，表示歡迎。略謂：「新任美國駐華大使司徒雷登，為非官史之美國人，旅華最久，不僅深明中國國情，且為中國朝野各方良友，渠之出任美國駐華大使，實為余之良好助手。」馬氏之聲明，顯示渠將繼續以杜魯門總統特使資格，留華工作，為中華之和平與團結努力。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓九日電〕杜魯門總統今日推監任命燕京大學校長司徒雷登為美國駐華大使，以繼前任大使赫爾利遺缺。據白宮發出之聲明稱：司徒雷登與蔣主席夫婦，及其他政府要人相知有年。司徒雷登過去曾力言美蘇兩國於對對華政策成立諒解，為解除中國許多糾紛之先決條件。</p>
<p>〔又電〕杜魯門總統今日宣稱：司徒雷登之被任為駐華大使，並不影響馬歇爾特使之地位。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十日電〕外交部發方人今日宣稱：美國任命燕京大學校長司徒雷登為駐華大使，尚未向外部徵求同意，惟此項任命如已正式確定，中國政府自極歡迎。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕司徒雷登出任美國駐華大使外部劉次長鍇特於外記者招待會表示歡迎，譽司徒氏為「中國之良友」。</p>
<p>司徒博士談話</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平十日電〕美國新任駐華大使司徒雷登今日在此間聯合社記者發表談話，謂「深感處境困難，惟當在任何方面盡力襄馬歇爾特使，完成其促進和平之使命。余對於馬氏之政策熱忱贊同」，此項任命將使余獲得新的經騐。司徒以學者出任外交官，尚屬生平第一次，事前對此曾有所知，但獲悉任命尚數小時，現當向燕大暫時請假，教育工作，不得不暫告中斷，其為可惜。一俟部署就緒，即當於日內赴京覆新。燕大校長繼任何人，尚無暇物色。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十日電〕教育家及傳教士司徒雷登突然任為美國認為杜魯門總統已物色中國各黨派最歡迎之人物。中央領袖周恩來稱：「余本人對司徒博士極其尊敬，並熱烈歡迎其任命，此項任命，遵得中國全處人民之深刻信賴」云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十日電〕葉府外交當局今日預料七十高齡之長老會教士司徒雷登出任駐華大使，將增強馬歇爾特使之力最，以團結中國國共兩黨，惟猜測馬使及司徒兩人完成使命之速率及程度，則未敢過事樂觀。</p>
<h3>胡適否認組黨</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日他報傳胡適返國後，將號召集進步的知識份子與自由主義者，組一新黨。茲據胡氏告本報記者，此說絕非事實，彼並無另組政黨之意。（另有與胡適有關之教育新聞，請參閱教育版。）</p>
<h3>中共「七七」宣言　純為宣傳烟幕　彭部長詳加解剖嚴予駁斥</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕外記者招待會十日午後四時半舉行，由彭部長學沛劉次長增主持，茲錄主要問題如次：</p>
<p>（問）政府對於中共在七七紀念日，所提出之四項新建議，態度如何，又政府對於中共反美宣傳誠度如何。</p>
<p>（彭部長答）中共七七宣言，乃為宣傳烟幕，而非真實建議，實於尋求和平途徑之外，別有用心。首二決非新聞題，停止衝突，堅於整編軍隊，確定駐地。政協重開，繁於中共覆得政協之原有各項決議。其餘二點，則恰巧揭開所謂反美運動之謎，此項反美宣傳，乃由於中共在國內政治利益上之需要，與政府及國民之意願完全相反。至於所謂拒絕美國援助，否認美國借款，實不值得認真討論。</p>
<p>目前軍事情情（問）部長六月卅日聲明，曾稱：如共軍進攻國軍，當予以抵抗或驅除，爾後會有此種行動發生否，現在受共軍攻擊之城市如何。</p>
<p>（彭部長答）目前軍事形，商要述之，為：（甲）共軍集中重兵，包圍海門六合等地，似將猛攻，此事政府極為注意，（乙）共猛攻天津南方之青縣，（丙）共軍繼續圍攻大同，（丁）共軍李先念部還反協定，從鄂北原駐地，向西突進，現逼近襄陽，以下為詳細情形，自七月一日以來，共軍不但未停止對山東西及東北之攻擊，且繼續湖北，河南，蘇北大規模攻勞，山東境內，津浦路大汶外國之晏城，一日至三日，被連續攻擊，青島以北之白沙，黃埠水源地，二日被攻擊，膠濟沿綫金岑鎮，淄河店，臨淄，濰縣，青州及即墨各附近均遭其不斷攻擊，現並向竟州附近增兵，淄川，博山以西地區，亦集有其兵力四五萬，似復有新行動。山西境內之寗武，一日被攻陷，繁峙四日被攻陷，並以十萬之衆圍攻大同。且增兵聞喜，侯馬及稷王山以東地區，凖備攻擊稷山。鄂東之羅出，鄂北之棗陽，南漳，豫南之鄧縣，皖省之焊，豫北之湯陰，武陟，及溫縣境內，迄今繼續被攻擊中。鄂東蔴城，已被攻陷，鄂北宜城，情況已入於不明，蘇北三個師，分向六合，來安方向猛進，其集結盟，沛，陽，永等縣之間二萬人及增至東海附近之共軍所編之偽軍郝　舉部，正分向楊山，通海進逼。河北之青縣，滄縣，及馬廠自六日起，仍被攻擊中。平漢，津浦，膠濟，同蒲，正太各儀路，均遭繼續破壞。一日以來，東北各地被攻擊地區，計有懷德西之伏龍泉，營日南之二道溝，臨場，松花江北岸等地。四日共軍並向松花江南岸砲擊，熱河省北票北之蒙古營子，及確區，一日亦被共軍攻擊</p>
<p>共軍佔領區域（問）關於共軍力量，可否請詳以見示，共軍在戰時及戰後軍隊數目若干，共軍佔領之區域，戰時戰後各若干。</p>
<p>（彭部長）共軍在廿六年九月廿二日，發表宣言，自願取銷紅軍番號，當時只有四萬五千人，遵從政府命今，改為三個師。政認繼又准其成立新四軍轄五個支隊，中央於廿九年七月十六日，復提示十八集團軍除編為三軍六師三個補充團外，並加兩個補充團，新四軍為二個師，不准成立支隊，嗣後新四軍違反軍紀，經中央於卅年元月十七日明令撤銷，卅三年共軍要求改編為十六個師，當時政府只允其改編為八個師至十個師。去年共軍與政府談判時共方復要求改編至十六師軍四十八個師，比開佔之初增加十六倍，當時政府勉應共方要求准其改編為廿個師，共軍亦未遵令改編。計共軍在整軍協議前，共有總司令部一，軍部一，師部十二，迄至本年六月，據調查所得，已擴編有總司令部二（東北一）軍部十四，（東北五），師部四十三（東北九），軍區五十五，獨立旅八十一，（東北十三），獨立團六十三（東北及地方團隊未詳）。此外共軍在東北方面者，有「民主聯軍」，在華北方面者，有「冀墊遼普綏」「晉冀」「魯豫」，「晉冀察」，「山東」，「陜甘寗」，「華中」，「中原」等八個野戰軍區，及「民主建國軍」「民主第二聯軍」等，其總兵力（連同地方團隊以及民兵）計在八十萬以上，至於共軍所佔領之區域，日本投降前，為七十四縣，自日本投降至本年一月十三日，再佔二百四十一縣，至一月十三日停止衝突命令後，又加佔廿二縣，總共佔據三百三十七縣。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十一日電〕社會部谷部長正綱以南通方面難民臨集，急須前往督導救濟，特於今日上午十一時，偕蘇主席王樊功乘京滬車赴鎮江轉南通。</p>
<h3>司徒雷登博士小傳</h3>
<p>司徒雷登博士（Gohn　Lcighton　Stuart）一八七六年生於中國杭州。父親司徒爾，是一個虔誠的基督教徒，很早來華宣教，所以司徒博士在幼年時代，過着中國的生活，隨着父母到中國各地去旅行，學習中國語方及文字。他家庭本是學校，醫院，社會的綜合物孤立在異族文化的環境中，這對於他是有很重要的影響的。在十一歲時，他被送回到美國去求學。一八九二年，他進行了哈普頓西德尼大學，他最大的興趣是希臘文和拉丁文。這時他就有一個大學教授的願望，一八九六年他獲得了文學士學位，一八九九年入了協和神學院。但是他對於傳這的工作覺得毫無意味，一九〇二年，他在神學院畢業之後，就在南方教堂中旅待了兩年，為教會募捐，這工作有驚人的成就，在旅行之中。邂逅遇見了羅安琳女士，極為傾慕，乃於一九四〇年來華之前，他和羅安琳女士結了婚。至一九三〇年，比寨斯登大學授以文學博士學位。</p>
<p>司徒博士於一九〇四年回到杭州之後，便幫助他父親，共同做傳教的工作，繼續有三年之久。這時，他開始研究古　文。一九〇八年，被聘為南京神學院的教員，從那時起，他在南京過了十一年學校生活，他對於這安靜的環境，十分滿意，這時他發表了許我的中文的著作。一九一八年起，北平匯文書院與河北通縣臨河書院合併為燕京大學，司徒博士被聘為燕京大學的校長。他不辭艱苦，毅然去担任創校的工作，一直到現在。燕京大學繼他用了三十年的心力，締造經營，纔達到今日的地位，門牆桃李遍海內，也可以自慰了。</p>
<p>民國廿六年蘆溝橋事變發生以後，北平環境日劣，司徒博士以不屈不撓的精神，繼續進行他的事來，經日方幾次阻撓，但仍處之泰然。抗戰期間，曾三度去渝，商談辦校事宜，以保持與中國當局的聯絡。至民國三十年太平洋戰事發生，日本對英美十分仇視，燕京大學遂被迫停學，司徒博士亦遭日方的拘禁，達三年又八個月之久。在司徒博士被拘禁時間，日方曾提出停戰條件，要他帶至重慶，司徒博士斷然拒絕。其對於中國之忠誠，由此可見。直至三十四年日本抽降後，纔被釋放出來。</p>
<p>司徒博士生於中國，一生事業，也在中國，中國是他的第二故鄉，他自已早已認為是中國人了。</p>

<h3>在無錫周涇巷之間　京滬車昨突出軌　司機及旅客卅餘受傷</h3>
<p>〔本報無錫十日電〕京滬路第二次凱旋號特快車，於十日晨十時許由滬駛京，過周巷站時，因路軌事先遭人破壞，致車頭及客車四輛突然出軌，傷重客卅餘人，損壞綫軌二十九條。木百餘根，幸未有死亡。交通中斷，現正在積極候理中。</p>
<p>〔本報蘇州十日電〕京滬路十日晨七時由上海開出之一次凱旋號特快車，於十時許駛至蘇碼段周涇巷與無錫南門之間，第一百二十公里第一十根電桿處，司機突覺車身震動，急忙煞車，綫車MCMA713號，已行出軌，乘勢前進，衝至路旁傾倒，機車後第一輛行李車，隨之出軌傾倒，行李車後二等車兩輛，頭等車兩輛全部出軌，餐車一輛，衹前四輪出軌均未傾倒，除司機李金山受重傷外，另有乘客三十餘人受輕傷，均已送無錫鐵道醫院醫治。傾倒車輛，觸及電桿，以致電訊同時受阻，時適有查道工人吳明祿經將情形報告周涇巷站站長，發電請搓，當由上海常州兩站，於十一點雙方開出救援列車，前往搶救，同時並由上北站開出汽油車，至出事地點，將凱旋號一部份旅客載回囘，該路侯副局長，北同工務處梅處長張副處長萬九、工務段馮段長，運輸段歐陽段長，機務段李段長及醫師護士等，乘汽油車前往，督同搶修。記者前往時，見車頭深陷泥淖中，路軌旁電桿被衝倒一根，電綫從橫交織，枕木損壞處已將修竣，乘客則均徒步至無錫南門，另搭別車，據路局方面稱：一切破壞決於今晨天明前修複，俾今日各班客車照常行駛。致此次出軌原因，查後發覺係共黨事前有計劃之陰謀，其目的在破壞交通。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕京滬綫凱旋號二次車出軌後，總站當即電命常州無錫站念開救援車至出事地點，將旅客轉載至無錫站，復搭乘六號車（原由京至滬出事後至無錫折回）來京，全部　旅客已於晚十時安全抵京。</p>
<h3>路軌即可修竣交通今晨恢復</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日上午七時，自上海北站開出之第二次特快車「凱旋」號，九時卅分駛至周涇巷與無錫南門間（約離上海一百二十公里處），一部份車輛出軌事，據調查結果：MCMA713號機車，及BMG882號行李郵件車，均告傾覆。SP70007515號二等車廂，及FP660.665號頭等車廂，均告出軌。FD614號頭等號車，前輪出軌。上海北站於接獲出事報告後，即召集各處負責人員，乘汽油車達至出事地點。十一時許，又開出救險車一列，裝載大批修路工人及路軌枕木工具等，運往出事地點搶修。同時，戚墅車站，亦有救陰車開出。各損毀車輛，業由超重機分別移開，一面加工搶修。大致今晨三時左右，可告修竟。聯明晨七時，凱旋號列車，將照常自北站開出。</p>

<h3>聯總工業設備　即日起暫停運華　重要糧食則不在其內</h3>
<p>〔美國新開處華盛頓九日電〕聯合善後救濟總署長賴伽第亞本日宣佈：自即日起，聯總一切工業與農業設備停止運華。賴氏稱：聞總物資在中國內地之分配情形不能認為滿意，中國各口岸必須出清聯總之物資，以便將此行等供應品照聯總軌事人員所認為滿意之辦法，分配與需要之人。賴氏稱：渠會料及中國各口岸擁擠之情形，並會設法對付之，渠會於六月六日通知蔣主席謂：各口岸若不出清，渠將採取行動。出清各口岸之工作計劃已擬成，並於本月付諸實施，因而中止工業與農業設備之運往中國，但已經載上船隻之貨物則不在此例。賴氏之佈告又稱：重要糧食如小麥，白米，五穀及牛乳等仍繼續運華，但亦以中國政府迅速出清各口岸及行總將救濟物資運至中國內地。以滿意方法分配為條件。</p>
<h3>聯總之行動早在意中蔣廷將總答覆</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自「聯總」署長賴伽第亞宣佈救濟物資自昨日起停運我國後，記者特往「行總」探詢。「行總」發言人因該署尚未得到正式通知，招物　,而事實上亦確有不得不然之苦衷。至所謂分配不能均勻云云，其要點似指共黨區域內所得較少，殊不知主要原因，亦即由於交通不便，苦干由共黨控制之區域內物資極度缺乏，確係事實，但「行總」亦已盡力運輸救濟物資，前往臨沂豫北及湖北禮山等共軍區域，且蔣署長亦曾與周恩來氏約定四點：（一）凡共區內受到戰禍者不分種簇，宗教與政治信仰，一律予以救濟；（二）行總絕不干涉地方行政；（三）共黨可派代表能加颶環「共區」之救濟工作；（四）如遇救濟工作人員或車輛被扣，「行總」即退出。一切工作，正秉此原則努力進行也。一般推測，賴伽第亞此次禁運物資來華，當係暫時性質？</p>
<h3>行總在烟台設立辦事處</h3>
<p>「又訊」「行總」發表，該署不日即將在烟台設一直屬總署之辦事處，由華島無黨派之華僑王師亮任主任，王氏已率屬員十餘人，及聯總黑德納氏，首途前往，籌備一切，並有LST輪一艘，載物資二千噸，駛至烟台。惟該辦事處因直屬總華關係，現正呈請行政院核辦中。按此實為「行總」在中共區內所成立之第一個辦事處。</p>
<h3>行總副署長答覆指責出賣糧食有苦衷</h3>
<p>〔路透社南京十日電〕自聯總職員聯名至電署長賴伽第亞指責中國政府使用聯總物資不當後，共產黨發言人謂此等指責，全係事實。根據共方數字，聯總物資之運抵共軍區者，僅千分之五。又據行政院善後救濟總署副署長稱：政府未曾供給行總適當經費，使其不得不出資無數飢民所需之糧食，此乃事實，但亦不得因此指責政府，行總固得出售一部份聯總物資，以補經費之不足也。但行總今又遭遇新困難，譬如麵粉等物，因飢民衆多已不復能售，且工價漲起數倍，一船物資之卸貨開支，即達法幣一萬萬元，倉庫堆棧費等尚不包括在內。已卸貨之船舶，共已達一百七十至一百八十艘，故行總在該方面之支出，已屬不貲。行總經費雖不由政府供給，但政府已於預案中撥出四三二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元作為本年度之善後及救濟費，其中交通一項，如鐵路公路水道之修濬即佔去約三八〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元。關於聯總職員指責之第二點，則並不確實。彼等謂中國政府違背協定中禁止以聯總物資之運往共產區者，僅總數之百分之二。迄至目前為止。其中如火車，鐵軌，木材及一部份藥品，須交給政府機關，故所謂某區獲幾分之幾者，須僅以直接供給人民之物品計算。火車鐵軌等等，應自總數中除去，交通阻斷，為分配救濟物資之最大困難，但行總仍盡力輸送，東北亦已在若干聯總物資獲得。蔣主應對於救濟物資之分配，亦素主以公允為原則云。</p>
<h3>財政部准糧食業　免征營業稅一年</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕勝利後財部為協助平抑糧價曾規定糧食業免征營業稅一年，初僅限於米麥雜糧等項，凡經加工製造者則不在免稅之列。茲悉：財部為普通救濟民食，業經推質範圍，凡麵婁玉米粉高糧粉以及豆類雜製成之粉未，不分製造與販賣業，准予照案自去年十月起免征營業稅一年，其已教之稅，准予憑證退還各地直接分局正遵辦中。</p>

<h3>蔣主席訓令政院　盡力協助聯總　通令全國各機關切實遵辦</h3>

<h3>歡迎司徒雷登大使</h3>
<p>前天，美國杜魯門總統任命司徒雷登博士為駐華大使。這是使我們何等愉快的一個喜訊！尤其在此遠東局勢杌隉不安之際，以素主美蘇二國對華政策應獲致諒解的司徒雷登博士出使中國，當更可為遠東和平效力，我們對於這位新任大使的歡迎，自不待言。</p>
<p>中美兩國邦交，素稱敦睦，經過八年炮火的洗煉，益形鞏固，且已成為患難之交。美國對於我們抗戰，初則在精神上寄以同情，繼則在物質上盡量援助，中國人民固已非當感激，而尤其難得的，美國常能為中國之睜友，忠告善道，使戰後中國向民主大道前進，且不惜以任何代價，協助中國成為強大統一的民主國家。自去年十二月間杜魯門總統發表對華政策以來，一直向着這個目標邁進，從未變更。此次美國駐華大使的更迭，雖是外交上的尋常事件，但國際關係日臻密切，國與國間之互助互信，實有賴於彼此的互相認識，司徒雷登博士可以說是美國認識中國最清楚的第一人，今番奉命使華，不僅足以增進中美兩國的睦誼，並且可進一步使整個遠東局勢受到良好的影響。</p>
<p>司徒雷登博士生於中國的杭州。他七十歲的年月，有五十年在中國生活着，說中國是他的第二故鄉，一些也不過分。他不僅了解我國的國情及民族的特質，而且洞悉我國的政情和人民的意見。他又因久居中國之故，熱諳中國語言文字，其言行思想，頗能與中國人相往來。他對於中國的貢獻，除了致力教育，歷任燕京大學校長三十年，桃李遍天下。他一生最令人感佩的地方，就是在太平洋戰爭爆發之後，被日軍拘禁於集中營，但是他的亮節高風，使日本人不能不肅然起敬，雖千方百計，威迫利誘，請其携帶日本對華媾和條件到重慶去，而他大義凜然，斷然拒絕，寗願挨餓受苦，不廿為日寇奔走。這種精神，永遠值得我們的感念產。我國政府於今年他七十誕辰的一天，特頒明令褒揚，這是中美文化交流史上光榮的一頁。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統任命這樣一位「中國之友」為駐華大使，也可以看出他對於中國問題的重視。最近幾星期來，因為共產黨根據了莫斯科報紙的反議論，多方企圖向中國人民煽動反美情緒，甚至不惜用種種手段，在美國友朋社會裏散播不利中國的謠言，製造中美間的隔膜，例如聯總暫停救濟物資運華等等，然後再利用這些事實，以為挑撥中國人反美的機會。中美兩國，原是志同道合患難之交，而偏有中共從中播弄，故中美兩國邦交，似乎將遭遇到一重考驗，不論在美國方面或在中國方面，在此時都應該把面前的一層薄雲一掃而空。本報為有七十餘年歷史之報紙，願以報人代表中國一般人民之意見，以為外面愈有破壞中美的邦交詭計，中美兩國愈有推心置腹披盱瀝膽的必要。故司徒雷登博士此時的使命，不但在加緊兩國政府的携手，尤其要促進兩國人民的親密合作。</p>
<p>司徒雷登博士天生有着雙重資格：一方面是美國紐約的法定公民；另一方面又生於中國杭州，以中國為其第二故鄉。美總統以這樣的人物，出使中國，對於促進中美兩國人民互相了解，固已較他人為適當，而況他又是一位教育工作者，以教育家任外交官，更能完成這個使命。因人我們還相信，真要國際能合作，真要世界能和平，世界的再教育，似乎是一個不可忽視的因索。近年的世界，因在戰亂時期，道德普遍降落，人性幾瀕泯滅，人類智慧似全用之於殺人利器，人類的文明，有整個毀滅的危險。我們要人類生存，要世界和平，非喚醒沈迷的人類不可。司徒雷登博士在中國，從事教育工作数十年，平津淪陷之後，雖在颠沛困難之中，猶假「美国教育会」的招牌，主持燕大校務，协助敵後抗戰的青年，真不愧為當代偉大的教育家。此次出任大使，必能本其教育家的本色，針對時弊，使人羣多向和平的大道前進，而對於馬歇爾特使，也必能予以極大的助力，使其艱鉅的使命終得完成。</p>
<p>今日遠東政局，端賴中美兩國的通力合作，但是英蘇兩國的勢力，尤其是北方的蘇聯，也是安定遠東的一大因素。司徒雷登博士在北方已久，對於蘇聯動向，知致，則當能盡其才力，更促進中蘇與美蘇的激底諒解，從而為遠東和平奠定鞏固的基礎。我們歡迎此新大使，不僅為中國，而實為遠東也為世界。</p>

<h3>蘇代表放棄頑固態度　和會決由五強召集　聯合國大會改九月廿三舉行　美蘇商討德國問題發生激辯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十日廣播：英美在四強外長會議中，今日又獲一重要勝利，而此勝利實與中國之體面大有關係。經英美施用壓力後，蘇外長英洛托夫已不再反對中國成為廿一國利會之邀請國。蘇聯放棄頑固態度，對於和會前途使人感覺樂觀。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎九日電〕今日蘇聯表示讓步，四強已決定將中國包括於和平大會遞請國之內。按廿一國和平會議已定於七月廿九日在巴黎召開。蘇聯初要求不將中國包括於和會邀遞請國之內，認為此事應由四強單獨辦理。美國務卿貝爾納斯當時雖認此舉有辱中國，但結果同意此項要求。中國政府對於此項辦法曾表示抗議，認為遠背莫斯科協定，因該協定中規定和平會議應由「全體外長會議」召集。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十日電〕四強外長昨議決請求聞合國秘書長賴依，將原定九月三日召開之聯合國全體大會，延至九月二十三日舉行。賴依前會致函外長會議，徵求關於聯大召開日期之意見。貝爾納斯謂和平大會開幕後，四國外長猶須集會討論和約最後之協定，故聯大召開日期必須移後，結果同意改期九月廿三日舉行。</p>
<p>關於廿一國和平會議程序法，四外長經若干修正後，已成立完全協議，關於持里埃斯特問題，經貝爾納斯之建議，議定設立特別委員會，研究該港之地位，於和會召開以前提出報告。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎九日電〕四強外長會議已於今日下午進入最後階段，自昨夜商留僉出請柬之成議後，遂獲廓清討論有關德國復雜問題之途徑。四外長討論德國問題，至晚上十九時三十分始已。莫洛夫曾嚴詞抨擊美國務卿貝爾納斯於四月廿九日所提出之管理德國廿五年計劃，主張延長至四十年。貝爾納斯亦予以嚴詞反駁，謂該一條約僅以解除德國武裝為目標，不涉賠款等問題，後者渠已建議交外長代表另行討論。現距離召開和會之期已不及三星期，而外長會議結束在即，故會議方面人士皆料在此期內對於解決德國問題一事，恐不致有何進展。英美對德國之問題，待於下屆外長會議中提出報告。德國問題之後，現尚有奧地利及義大利之政局問題，皆仍為外長會議正式議程之一。</p>

<h3>蘇聯違反莫斯科協定　英美報一致抨擊　各國對此退讓實為一種恥辱</h3>
<p>〔中央守紐約八日專電〕紐約時報今日論蘇外長之堅持阻撓中國為和會之邀請國，謂「此顯係受其歪曲之遠東政策之指示。」該文抨擊蘇聯，係遣反其先前自已之協定，並指出去歲十月莫斯科舉行之外長會議係包括中國在內。該文攻擊蘇聯堅持由四強擬定和會之程序規則，謂「無一自軍之代表能忍受蘇聯所提議之此種命令。」尤有進者，「蘇聯之欲強行制定和會程序規則，無系疑係企圖使和會一如安理會屈服於其意志之下，無法採取行動」，該報謂，民主國家如對此點退讓，必致使整個和會，僅為一種恥辱。</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦九日專電〕每日電訊報論蘇聯之堅決斥中國於和會邀請國之外，謂其胸襟過於狹窄，各報電均刊載中國之抗議，但每日電訊尚係唯一之撰論批評者。</p>
<h3>菲律賓總統羅哈斯　首次接見我記者　表示中菲商約即可簽訂　菲島僑胞可獲平等待遇</h3>
<p>〔中央社記者李宜培馬尼刺八日電〕記者本日下午往訪菲總統於馬六甲宮總統府，詢以菲國對我僑胞之一船政策。承答菲島華僑可獲國際公法所規定之標利及特權，在法律上將獲同等之機會及保護。菲國有各民族待遇平等之條律，其他兩外國記者馬費城公報記者寶達及美國「本週」雜誌記者林德女士，此係菲總統就任以來第二次接見外國記者，接見我國記者則尚屬首次。菲總統談及在簽訂中之中菲商約稱，盼該約「即可」簽字，渠稱，中國可獲與其他國家同等之最惠國條款，惟不與美國相同而已。因菲律賓仍與美國保持特殊關係，美國務院之顧間將協助菲共和國與其他各國締結各種商約。記者以菲政府是否擬派商業代表團赴國外。羅哈斯總統答稱，菲律賓人士目前所注意者，為自外購進而非向外輸出，目前尚無此種計劃。關於在南京設立大使館或公使館問題尚未十分決定。談及渠之訪華日期時，記者保證中國政府與人民均將對渠熱烈歡迎。渠笑答稱，「承君相告，至為感謝，餘亟欲訪華一行，蓋以余已多次前往貴國，當余九歲時，曾往廣州，然因目前冗務待理，最近將來恐不能成行。」</p>
<h3>我訪菲代表團　今日離菲返滬</h3>

<h3>顧維鈞大使　訪晤艾克遜</h3>

<h3>對日定制會開會　美代表艾其森　抨擊共產主義　指勞工法含濃厚色彩　於民主化日本不適用</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京十日電〕四國管制日本委員會今晨開會，討論：（一）返國日人復歸正常生活問題，（二）檢疫問題，（三）預防傳染病問題，（四）糧食及藥品法，（五）統一糧食販賣者及糧食配給機關之取締法（以上麥帥提案），（六）戰爭調查會問題，（七）日本之勞動法，（八）軍需補償問題（以上　代表提案）。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京十日專電〕四強對日委員會今晨開會時，空氣頗不融洽，緣英代表鮑爾解釋使遣送返國之日軍民加入其國民生活問題與一切其他問題有關時，曾兩度被會議主席美代表艾其森打斷其發言，其後又因與會各代表拒絕討論麥帥新提之四事，而遭挫折。各代表拒絕討論四事之理由，為各事過於專門，且又與僅對日管制政府無關也。我代表朱世明宣稱，倘上項請求被堅持，則中國政府凖備供給盟軍總部，以上述各問題之專家，英蘇代表亦有同樣表示。</p>
<p>〔改造社電〕旋由蘇代表提出其所擬勞工法修正案，主張廠方關閉工廠時，由工人代廠方直接管理工廠時，由工人代廠方直接管理生產，由工人代廠方直妝管理　生產。艾契生乃對此作重要發言，猛烈抨擊共產生義稱，關於蘇聯之建議，應有加以問明之必要，第一建議各點多已實行，似不能作為新提案交本委會討論。關於日本勞動之目標，乃在確立民主主義原則，自應根據此原則，決定日本之勞動法規，倘遇於詳細指示，則聯合國未免失諸獨裁，且亦違北波茨坦宣言。最高司令官值軍事佔領之時，實無以武力強制日本實行各種規定之意，蓋以武力強制行事，亦與此時吾人正給與日人之自由背道而馳。細察蘇聯之建議案，覺帶有色彩，並有宣傳性，今日在日本發生共產主義乃至共產主義者之勞力問題，殊覺遺憾。余對於蘇聯之共產主義制度，並不敢苛責，但不欲培植共產主義於日本，惟將使日本實行民主主義原則，日人亦將為自身福利計，正在努力求得民主主義之恩惠。</p>
<h3>日本吳港發現　毒氣庫七處</h3>

<h3>朱世明將軍在東京　檢閱美騎兵師　特鳴砲十一響致敬</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京九日專電〕我赴日參與盟國對日管制委員會代表團團長朱世明，今午疲邀檢閱美駐日騎兵第一師部隊暨坦克車隊，檢閱後，該師師長蔡斯中將，並邀朱將軍共港午膳。朱將軍甫抵據繞東京城區之該師營地時，即有儀隊歡迎，蔡斯並親趟迎接。且按朱氏官階，鳴咆趕不上一響致敬，第一騎兵師隊，旋由軍隊前導，以美倰姿態，步過檢閱台，繼之簡單受動儀式，並對獲獎者致賀。渠於進膳後，即被邀參觀營地，並被介紹蔡斯之高級僚屬晤面。</p>

<h3>關東軍下落何在？　美報稱迄無一人返日</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約八日電〕紐約時報提及關車軍之命運，承認被俘日軍返日，然未聞有關車軍一名返日之事。時報載稱：「美理應注意此一歷大軍隊之下落，蓋蘇已利用此支軍隊為工具，強索在雅爾達會議中得自吾人及英人之讓步也」。該報復聞關東軍以及韓北及庫實島所有日軍均被裝運西伯利亞，同時約有廿萬人，由審陽移往貝加爾湖地區。據云：彼等之工作係將在中之工廉，移建於該區，故關東軍之命運，仍屬一謎。</p>
<h3>東京市長　五人被撤職</h3>

<h3>比內閣辭職</h3>
<p>參院投不信任票</p>
<p>〔路透社布魯塞爾九日電〕比內閣在參院中未能獲得信任票後，已向攝政查利親王提出辭呈，攝政黨予接受，並屬總理范亞克於新內閣成立前，繼續供職。參院昨係以七十九票對七票通過不信任內閣。基督社會黨所組織之整個左冀反對黨，在參院中均表示不信任內閣，自由黨。共黨，社會黨則贊助政府。比京人士認為此次參院之投不信任票，主要原因在反對司法部長葛拉貝克，對宣大奸逆，過於寬容之政策。</p>

<p>制憲會議之權力今僅限於二項事件，即（一）少數民族間題，及（二）與印度之條約問題。少數民族問題純為內政事件，吾人對此皆望能獲得滿意之解決，對於英印之將來關係，吾人亦希望能成立和議之條約，一俟國大黨參加制憲會議後，當將效力促其實現。國大黨今將先行研究英國代表團建議所造成之局勢。</p>

<h3>國際法庭檢察處　宣讀我外交部文件　清算日侵華血賬　荒木田中供辭暴陰謀　羅斯福致電日皇事重提</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京十日專電〕國際法庭檢察處今日於繼續摘要宣讀荒木貞夫之口供時稱：荒木貞夫會露佈除東北三省外，熱河省亦包括在關東軍偵領區內，以防止張學良利用該省作反攻東北之根據地。此係在日區密院會義中所決定者，嗣後經御前會議一致通過。按日御前會議參加者有閣員，及傴密院顧問官。當時美駐日大使羅勃斯會有電致美國務卿稱：日政府曾向渠保證，中國主權將不受損害。一九三一年十二月一日，日政付曾派員至美國駐日大使館，向美大使福勃斯保證日本將不擴大東北事件，而不致使中國喪失主權。嗣後福勃斯在該電中繼謂：「日方仍積極凖備，以期將來進一步深入東北，而日軍閥一旦獲得自由行動機會，即可發動」。第一電報係於一九三一年十一月廿四日發出。內稱：日外相幣原喜重郎，曾通知肅勃斯謂：日首相，陸相及參謀總長已同意決不讓錦州發生戰事。東北地方匪勢猩獗，故該地日僑必需有日軍加以保護云。</p>
<p>六年侵略</p>
<p>〔改造社東京十日電〕其次檢察官進達宣讀我外交部所公布「民國廿年九月十八日迄民國廿六年八月三日間日軍侵略行為」中「日軍佔領遼·吉·黑·熱四省」一節稱：「日軍占領遼寗·吉林·黑龍江後，繼績其侵略西方之計劃，民國廿一年春淞滬戰役結束後，增強其在東北各省之兵力。民國廿一年七月中旬，日藉口日軍將校石本失蹤，開始攻擊熱河，七八兩月發動兩次總攻擊，但遭中國軍隊抵抗，未獲進展。民國廿二年初，啓戰端於機關，山海關，九門口相繼陷落，中日情勢告爭。同年二月廿二日，日軍以傀儡「滿洲國」名議，對中國發出最後通諜，稱熱河非中國領土，要求熱省內中國軍隊於廿四小時內撤退。同年二月廿五日，戰擊遂啓。日軍由通達。綏由據點美工始總攻擊。同年三月二日，熱河省亦以軍政治理由為日本本所占領」。</p>
<p>繼由檢察官劉愛琳女士宣讀塘沽協定全文中，復由檢察官海達提出各種證據文件。最後庭諭因天氣炎熱，今日下午停止審理，改十五日晨再開，屆時庭上可裝成通風設備。魏勃稱：「此乃空前未有之巨案，吾人應有合理的舒適。吾人籛</p>

<p>珠港前夕</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京九日電〕一九四一年底，故羅斯福總統以私人電致日皇裕仁，呼績最後和平，當時裕仁反響如何，今日又復舊事重提。數星期以前，預料此一問題在戰犯審訊中將澈底探討。據當時任外務省美洲課長之山本談稱：日皇接到此電，凖備在珍珠港事變前不久作有希望的答復。但據前內大臣木戶去年九月問告記者，謂裕仁於接到此電後，拒絕作答，因內閣各大臣告以「與國內戰潮相抗，無濟於事。」目前能正確知悉此事者，僅有少數人而已。其中一人為前外相東鄉，一般人以為東鄉於是日清晨自前美國駐日大駛格魯接到此電，即已是遞日皇。關於此一重大時期之各項問題。其他日人意見不一。其中一人稱：日皇於御前會議時接到此電，退入私齊，對於和平難保，曾為之痛哭；但此說迄未能證實。山由卽未參加會議，故僅可間接獲得報告，得悉東鄉會將故羅總統之電擱忱，直至日進攻珍珠港後廿五分鐘，始呈遞日皇。日皇當親自開始草擬復電，表示願和平。法庭一部份證人力言，日皇對於滿洲事變，獲得充分報告，特無力加以制止耳云。</p>

<p>〔中央社東京九日專電〕東京國際法庭檢察官今以日本各報所載前日陸相南次郎於一九三一年在日軍師長會議中之演辭摘要，交國際法庭，蓋此演辭為官方紀錄也。該演辭抨擊中國之政策，有不利於日本之傾向，且強調滿蒙當保持密切關係，不論自國防觀點，或政治經濟觀點視之，均有此需要。辯護律師猛烈反對，僅以摘要提出法庭，要求提交演辭全文。渠抨擊檢察官提出此種證據，並稱：「予知檢察官有全文在手」。檢察官證明渠確無法獲得全文，復被告律師乃收回抨擊，並向渠表示歉。</p>

<h3>路局大舞弊案偵訊　女職員聯袂出庭　侃侃述貪污內幕　受賄諸犯盡俯首處長依然說不知　郁香嚴又投「尺素」</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕路局舞弊巨案，於昨日上午十一時半起，又由全檢察官開庭偵查，被提訊者計有主犯材料長張鴻圖，及從犯陳景耀·張伯康·經偉鈞·丁澍惠等五名，秘密告發人黃汝珍·沈珪璋亦於同時傳訊。昨晨九時許，諸犯即被法警從看守所中提出，不久告發人亦向地檢處報到。沈·黃二人原為該處女職員，昨日傳訊時，沈珪璋衣黑香雲紗旗袍，白皮鞋，黃汝珍則穿粉紅色小圓花短旗袍，赤脚穿白皮鞋，年紀均在二十餘歲，因不願收受配給贓款每人法幣廿萬元，向上峯密報，遂能破獲此案。據稱全部贓款，張鴻圖分得三成，副處長經偉鈞與材料科張伯康各得二成，其餘三成則分給該處職員俞佩恩·丁澍惠·張澤隆·王人懋·朱培宗·顧振民·朱必聞·夏定武·陳景耀·李潔·孫學三·李潤生·張開源等人。因沈·黃二人分述貪污分贓之經過頗詳，不得不使受賄之諸犯俯首默認，僅主犯張鴻圖仍一口推說不知。至下午一時半，始告偵訊完畢，沈珪璋·黃汝珍二人均飭回，其他諸犯仍還押。又徐傳貴·　志道·何祖恩三人，已自路局移解至地檢處，曾經略訊一過，亦覊押於看守所內，聞莫罪嫌頗輕，惟據全檢察官語記者：彼擬從速了結該案，故各犯均不輕予交保，現除郁香嚴在逃未獲，工役李潤生交保外，其他十八名被告均暫押地院看守所，以便每天提訊。又據可靠消息：今日上午全檢察官仍將開庭偵查張鴻圖等諸犯。</p>

<p>〔又訊〕路局舞弊案要角，至今尚未投案之郁香嚴，昨又致函本報，並附答兩路局長陳伯莊及警務處長王兆槐函一件，有所辯白，兩函原文摘錄如下：（一）「……兩路舞弊案之發生，其中另有內幕隱情，其主要是不與他們合作……，幸現在當局不乏賢明之官吏，我們總可雪寃一天云云……。」（二）「陳伯莊局長召集兩路職員發表談話：「該案真相大白，主犯郁香嚴。張鴻圖因其妻潛逃而被押，候妻到，即可釋放。並限四十八小時內將款項繳還公家。郁香嚴携帶舞弊款八千萬元，限張鴻圖將妻找到」等語。王兆槐處長說：「郁香嚴即使不能說是主犯，但是旣和本案主犯張鴻圖是夫婦關係，當然是正犯之一。」……似這兩位長官所說的話，所做的事，都是代表一個國家機關說話，如此朝秦暮楚，今我接受那一項罪好呢？如果聽王處長的話，好像在法律上，以我看法似乎沒有犯罪，我不過一個犯罪的妻子而已。如果根據陳局長說話，證據確實，妻是主犯，張鴻圖不過因妻潛逃代妻受過……」。該信騐查郵戳，知仍為本埠寄發者。又悉，該案有關人犯經路局警務處移解地檢處後，該處復發現材料處上海材料倉庫職員王三川，亦有串同舞弊嫌疑，遂予看管，經偵訊後，確有實據，即於九日上午解送地檢處，併案辦理。外傳路局又發現新舞弊案說，並非事實。</p>

<h3>探女監</h3>
<p>提籃橋上海監獄第一分監，是本市唯一的女監所在地，平日門禁森嚴，一道道的大鐵門上，加上了重重的大鎖，閒人是沒有法子進去的，記者昨承狄監長的招待，進去作了一番觀光，覺得裏面一切的設施，堪稱中國女監的模範。</p>
<p>監獄共分五層，底下一層是工作人員的辦公處，二樓是女漢奸的囚房，現在關在裏面的有大小漢奸七個，以殺人不眨眼聞名的女漢奸佘愛珍，就是其中之一。</p>
<p>三樓是普通犯人的囚房，房中有新式衛生設備，每間六人，上面舖了「塌塌咪」，房間雖然不大，但也足够六人伸展而睡了。記者參觀時，房中都是空的，因為犯人們都上工場工作去了。據監長相告，監中囚犯的生活極有規律，每天從早晨六時至八時為識字和運動的時間，八時以後至下午六時，則須為監中作生產工作，所以白天留在監房中的，除年老無力的老太婆外，還有帶嬰兒的母親。原來這些人的丈夫死了，家裏沒有親人，自己犯了罪，（她們大多數犯的是販賣白麵罪）懷中的孩子就無人照料，對於這種犯人，監方特別通融，允許她們把孩子帶進來，並且對於這些無辜的兒童，加以特別優待，每天可喝牛奶少許。據說其中有二個嬰孩還是生產在監獄中的，而他們的母親，已經被判了十一年的徒刑，那麼這個在獄中生長的孩子，雖然不能說他是不見天日，但是當他十一歲時，踏出監獄的大門，看到外面花花綠綠的一切，和盲人重見天日的情景，又有什麼兩樣呢？</p>
<p>餐塲一瞥</p>
<p>監獄中每一層都有工場和餐塲，當記者走近餐塲，看守監獄的職員用嚴肅的聲調高喊「起立」！裏面受過訓練的犯人都放下了手中的工作，立正起來，彬彬有禮的表情，叫人非常感動，同情之心，油然而生。記者到餐塲的時候，差不多近中午了，所以犯人們正忙着燒菜，長桌子上一排排的放着剛燒好的蕃茄煮青菜，紅綠相間的顏色，加上熱騰騰的蒸氣，實在是非常誘人的！但是這些優美的菜肴，是專供監中職員吃的。犯人的飲食，監中有一定的規定，每天二餐，第一頓早晨九時，第二頓下午三時，其份量為每餐白飯二十兩（約三碗），素菜四兩，監二兩（由伙食公司專送，每天擇菜塲上較便宜的，）油一錢。因為女子的飯量小，所以這些食糧，大槪還不至於挨餓。</p>
<p>工塲小景</p>
<p>沿着餐塲進去，便是工塲，工場分三部分，第一間是專做女人旗袍的，並備有洋機二架。第二間是專做囚衣的，因為獄中的犯人都須穿一律的藍布制服，目前因囚衣不敷應用，所以由犯人在趕製中。第三間是專打絨綫的，五顏六色的絨綫堆滿了長桌子，這些都是由外界接來的工作，據負責人說：這些女犯人都極聰明，只要略加指導，便可以做得很好，當記者踏進工場時，場內鴉雀無聲，一排排整齊的犯人，都在埋頭專心工作，秩序的良好，叫人不得不佩服當局的管理有方。</p>
<p>女犯統計</p>
<p>上海女監中的犯人總計一二七人，其中以販毒最多，計七十九個，此外殺人，盜搶，詐欺，風化，妨害家庭，傷害死亡等都有，年齡平均以三十至四十五歲的最多數，最小的是十五歲，最大的是六十五歲。其中有二個外藉犯人，一個是奧人，一個是俄人，是同案的犯者，所犯的罪很重，據說是在酒排間內殺了一個人，其中的一個，是惟一被判死刑的。</p>
<h3>不堪回首話影星　悲愴悽凉袁美雲</h3>
<p>在這些犯人中，比較惹人注目的是犯吸毒罪的電影明星袁美雲和夏佩珍，夏佩珍因為近日患牙痛，所以睡在病房裏，袁美雲在初解入時，也因鬧胃病而常感不適，但是近日來已經全好了，所以生活很正常，她與夏佩珍同房，室中共住六個人，都是吸烟犯。依照判決，她要到十月十一日才可期滿出獄，但是聽說她可以提早釋放，因為在事實上，她現在已經沒有癮了。當記者參觀時，她正坐在工塲裏安靜地打絨綫，白晳的皮膚，似乎比電影裏更胖了，從外表觀察，的確找不出一絲的烟容。當記者踏進工塲時，她抬起頭來，臉上還帶着微笑，但是當她瞥見攝影記者手中的照相機時，她的頭馬上了低下去，第一張照片拍成後，她的頭是更低了，等到拍第二張照片時，她竟然以手帕蒙臉，立時跟隨起來了。記者當初驚奇為什麼袁美雲如此善哭，但是轉念一想，這是難怪的，當美光燈亮起的時候，她一定會立刻追想起普日活躍在水銀燈下的明星生涯，撫今追昔，難免要流一滴悲愴悽凉的眼淚了！</p>
<h3>準備招待記者　報告事實經過</h3>
<p>記者詢以在獄中的感想和將來的計劃，她拒不回答，說是因為近日情緒惡劣，並且表示對這次的判決非常不滿，她說等到釋放以後，預備大規模的招待記者，報告事實的經過，和今後的工作。</p>
<p>據監長相告，袁美雲的丈夫王引，曾經到監中探望過她，但是照監獄規則，犯人是絕對不能任意接見的，所以夫妻並沒有相會，但是監長為了同情她，所以曾另約時間，命王引再來，然而王引表示反正袁美雲出獄期不遠了，還是省此一舉，免得彼此太動感情，因此直到現在，他們還沒有見過面。</p>
<p>據記者探悉：袁美雲已經收到執行監察官傳邦代其申請免除餘刑之申請書，不日經地院沈天保推事裁定後，恢復自由的日子，為期當在不　了。（聖心）</p>
<h3>暴風雨下的西藥製造廠　記信誼鮑廠長談片</h3>
<p>勝利以前，因為外國貨來源顯絕及戰時的需要，上海的西藥製造廠總數達一百七十餘家，生意都不差；但在今日，由於外國藥傾銷，由於國人迷信舶來品，上海的新藥製造廠只剩七十家，而且這七十家中，大部份都陷於停頓或半停頓的狀態中。</p>
<p>還在日夜繼續出品，而仍然可以維持的，目前只有幾家規模較大的藥廠，它們資力比較充裕，出品比較有歷史。信誼藥廠便是其中之一。</p>
<p>信誼總廠在中正中路，最最大的廠房不是總廠而是馬斯南路廿號。此外還有陸家路一二〇號，北京路九一四號，普陀路二一一號，林森路六七〇號等處，都是具有規模的製藥工塲。最近，他們又在崇明路八二號，弄到了一個大工塲，這是面積達十五萬平方呎的鋼骨水泥五層樓房，本來是德鄰公寓。將來這座高樓大槪將是信誼的總廠。</p>
<p>機械設備</p>
<p>信誼最珍貴的一種機械是「複式蒸餾水機」，這是在太平洋戰爭以前自美國運來的。據說這是最新式的設備，這種蒸餾機的蒸餾水，完全不與空氣接觸，十分潔凈，其所造成的注射劑，可以避免一切反應和不良副作用。在上海，只有信誼具有這優良的設備。</p>
<p>此外，他們還有單式蒸餾水機，冷氣設備，旋轉式軋片機，新式軋片機，自動安　製造機等等，配備的確不差。</p>
<p>中藥西　製</p>
<p>中國本草大多為植物性，在醫理上，有其獨到的功效，惜國藥的配製還不够科學化，效用因而减低；所以，中藥西製早就有人提倡並試騐。信誼的中藥西製，已獲得相當成功，據該廠廠長鮑國昌說，現在為止，當歸，大黃及川貝母等，都已開始用西法配製。其中的「使君子」，經西製後可以代替「三道年」，而且效力比「三道年」強。這些西製的中藥，不特製成了粉·丸，而且還製成注射劑。用國藥「生山切」製成的針藥，便是很好的止血強心劑。</p>
<p>困難種種</p>
<p>鮑廠長說得很對，外國貨傾銷，目前只不過是開端，真正的大量傾銷，還在一九四七年。那時，我們如沒有辦法抵制，將感到百倍於目前的威脅了。現在，英國貨出產仍有限，歐洲各地需要還很大，美國國內需要也很大，到中國市塲來銷的藥品還有限，到了明年他們多數的兵工廠都變成藥廠，所有的士兵統統復員，那時候我們的化學工業將真正吃不消了！</p>
<p>我們的困難：人工貴，生產速度低，原料又從外國來，故無法競爭。例如，西藥原料的關稅率是百分之二十五，而外國藥的製成品也不過百分之三十，我們的成本怎樣和人家競爭。</p>
<p>還有，他們國家銀行經常以一分半的利息貸款給藥商，而我們今日的利息又是那麼高。再以機器來說，一九四一年的機器（我們所認為最新式的）和現在最新的機器來比，其生產速度相差達四十倍，我們怎樣與人家競爭？</p>
<p>不過信誼藥廠在半年以後，將以與美國今日同樣的新配備來增產，所以，前途還不太暗淡。但是，時至今日，我們化學工業的前途，絕不是信誼一家的問題。這是極其顯然的。（索貝）</p>

<h3>碼頭倉庫擁塞　停泊船雙日達廿艘　每日損失一萬萬元以上</h3>
<p>「本報訊」據中華碼頭公司總理劉念智吿稱：邇來本市各碼頭及倉庫，因大批敵僞物炎，逐步出淸；美軍亦陸續騰出碼頭，且濬浦局之挖泥工作，已積極推進，故擁塞情形，視前已略見進步。惟公家及救濟總署方面所堆存之物資仍夥，往往數月不動。倉庫地位，盡爲呆擱。外來船隻所載貨物，遂不能隨到隨卸，因而滯留港內者，每日平均達廿艘。滯留時間，常達二星期之久。平均每船因滯留，而日需耗用達美金三千元。故以廿艘言，則一日間不必要之耗損，已達法幣一萬萬元以上。此項耗損，直接間接，均轉嫁於政府及人民之肩上。故劉氏建議：爲發展上海之對外貿易，繁榮上海之港口計，碼頭倉庫之停泊與堆貨，均應富有流動性。時期應短，俾使貨暢其流。建設方面，應力求上海碼頭倉庫之機械化，多用機器發動，以代人工。旣可節省勞工成本，又可使工作簡捷化。劉氏深望政府對所接購之美軍剩餘物資中，應將碼頭適用之機械，設法從速利用，或發售於各碼頭使用。據估計，利用機器結果，至少可照目前人工費用，節省五倍至十倍。劉氏又述及最近碼頭倉庫所盛行之偸竊行爲。據吿：此項大規模之偷竊行爲，極有組織。外來船隻到埠時，船上船員常輿起艙小工勾串，在艙底即施行偸竊。拋江過駁時，即有小舢板（俗稱水老鼠）　集，分批竊運而出。又貨物在碼頭起卸時，上下小工進出繁多，更屬防不勝防。劉氏特別指出：因該項偸竊，俱屬有組織之行爲，故爲防止計，警察局，水上警察，輪船公司，及各碼頭倉庫之主管當局，應庥體合作，曾商切實而有效之防止辦法。無論船艙及碼頭倉庫，於上下貨物時，均應遴派幹員，嚴密監視。並應訂定賞罰規則，俾促進工作效率云。</p>
<h3>白米價格提高以後　南北市到米踴躍　米號拒絕承售平價糙米</h3>

<p>〔又訊〕市政當局爲顧到一般貧苦市民之食米問題，前昨兩日均擬繼續配給糙米各五千包，交各米號按照限價平售，但米號拒絕收售，現當局已令各區公所指定米店數家，經售平價米，日內開始實行云。</p>
<p>糧食部上海總倉庫此次撥付市府食米五萬石，聞最後一批五〇〇噸，於昨晨由招商局五六〇號鐵駁運埠，交付後，五萬石米亦即全數交淸。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕招商局所接收之美登陸艇二十艘，其間五艘並已分配與民生公司接管，現均在改裝中，頃據糧食總倉庫葉主任云，是項登陸艇係專爲運米之用，每艘可裝米二〇〇噸至三〇〇噸云。</p>

<h3>煤市交易活躍</h3>
<p>煤業市塲昨久雨初晴，客戶添購頗股，同業交易亦呈活躍，白煤篩塊來源因受辦本利息高及遝輸時間長之影響，辦貨者尙難獲厚利，故到貨仍少，是以行情突見猛升，烟煤塊與煤屑行市仍爲背馳，塊煤因缺貨及殭石損耗奇重，喊價又高，煤層浦東棧單二號層則見十四萬五千元新低價。</p>

<p>支票之劃有平行綫或特別平行綫者，（即在平行綫內開明某某銀行等）僅能對銀錢業者，或特定銀錢業者支付之，係票據法第一三四條所規定，，換言之，即劃綫支票，僅可由銀行錢莊代收，特別劃綫支票，僅可由指定之行莊代收，近來縱據習慣，於本票匯票上，亦有加劃平行綫及特別平行綫者，認爲效力一如支票，實則然，四聯總處前爲此事，特函請財政部核復，茲已復到，略謂：「依照民事法例，法律所未規定者依習慣，票據法第九條旣有強制規定：『票據上記載票據法所不規定之事項者，不能發生票據上效力。』故本票及匯票，劃有平行綫二道者，不能發生票據法第一三四條關於支票所規定之效力。」此項復文，係根據司法院院字第二八三〇號解釋。</p>

<h3>憑弔蘆溝橋</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員張劍梅　七月五日北平通訊</p>
<p>時間槅了九年　創痕猶新</p>
<p>七月二日，北平幾位同萊，以拜抗戰聖地的心情，訪問了蘆溝橋。</p>
<p>蘆溝橋在北平西南卅裏，一條日本人修的平整柏油公路，把它們緊密地連接在一起。過彰儀門經過一次檢查，我們的汽車便向西駛去。除了一箭開外星羅棋布的黃色碉堡，公路上是一片熙攘往來的和平氣氛。鄉下人的運糧大馬車，和賣瓜果的担挑迤邐北行，在向北平輸血。兩旁的麥子早已收割了，因為缺雨，秋莊稼還沒種上，大部的土地都在裸露著。</p>
<p>不到半點鍾，已經到了宛平域了，這個城才真正是戰爭的起點。九年以前的七月六日，牟田口聯隊要通過這個城到永南河以南演習，被守城國軍擋駕了，他們藉口七月五日在永定河彼岸演習時缺了兩名兵，一定要進城尋找，仍被守軍拒絕，牟田口聯隊便在第二天東方微明時，發動了震動世界的七七事變。雖然時隔九年，侵略者所給予宛平的創痕猶新。北城門兩旁的城牆，被砲彈打的七零八落，後來日本人在破壞的地方，砌補了新磚。但是新磚與黝黑的古城砌在一起，充分表現了創傷和不調和。宛平城本來很小，從北到南不過一里的直徑。城內九年前被砲轟毀的房屋，至今沒有修理，到處是敗瓦頹垣，碎磚爛木，地上滋生著巨窩　草，天空　遊著鷹　烏鴉．城裏除了駐軍，人民已很少了，宛平縣政府不曉得是耐不住宛平荒城的寂寞呢，還是供應不了過往軍隊的　，爽性搬到辛店了。現在城裏只有一個蘆溝橋鎮公所。</p>
<p>北國十景之一　蘆溝曉月</p>
<p>馬哥包羅到過的蘆溝橋，就在宛平南門不到百米的地方。是一座長約四十米，寬約三米的石橋。雄　的跨在黃蕩蕩的永定河上．這從金朝大定廿九年開工，整整作了四年，建築得夠精緻了。每一個橋欄桿上都鵰著一座髙可一尺的獅子，但是每個獅子的腿下還蹲著許多小獅子。橋上賣甜瓜的說：「大獅子有數，小獅子沒數」。七百五十七年來人間的改朝換代，戰亂風雨，好像還沒有給予它過多大打擊。幾百個小獅子中只有三個獅子的頭部被劈去了一部分。</p>
<p>橋北端上有著一座碑，上書「蘆溝曉月」，據說這是北京十景之一，大概從橋上去看永定河上西沉的曉月，是別有一番風趣的，可惜我們到達時太晚了。和蘆溝橋遙遙相對的，是西邊的平漢路鐵橋，它是一座長達百五十餘米修長美麗的黑色鐵橋化，亦覆壓在永定河上，它是夠現代化了，但是我們勿甯更喜歡古色斑斑的蘆溝橋。不是由於「蘆溝曉月」的美麗。以及當駱駝載著鈴聲過橋所引起的懷古幽情，而是因為它是我們偉大的抗戰的出發點。當七七以後平漢路永定河大橋時，這座古橋在我們拿著大刀的廿九軍弟兄手裏始終固若金湯，直到七月卅日國軍退出北平後，橋上的守軍才自動撤退。</p>
<p>往日煊赫豐碑　陷泥土中</p>
<p>日本軍隊最初在宛平城以西的一文字山邱陵向我軍開了第一砲。所以日本人也把這塊地方當做了他們侵略中國的「發祥地」。在一片石礫場中，除了幾間白色的丟了門窗的破房，記者幾乎找不到任何東西。最後才在一座小土山尋到被推倒狼狽的躺在半山坡的可憐的紀念碑。碑以白石製成，主文是：</p>
<p>「一文字山支那事變發端之地，」另外一面注明：「昭和十二年七月八日　二十九日至二儿牟田口部隊，戰場同二十八日野口騎兵部隊激戰　積」（表示這是牟田口聯隊和野口騎兵隊的戰場）碑座的四面也刻著字「支那事變勃發一週年紀念　日」方　北京在留邦人之　並敘述建碑經過：「因二碑面　書八毛　此　地　木標二　牟田口部隊長　筆蹟　寫刻乜　（表示碑面的字是根據牟田口部隊長木牌上的筆蹟刻的）最後注明立碑日期：「昭和十三年七月七日帝國在鄉軍人會北平分會」。原來牟田口部隊和野口騎兵隊的那些人們今日也許變做砲灰了，也許做了戰犯了。逎往日赫赫的「豐碑」，也被推橫臥在泥土中了。</p>
<p>將軍來自徐州　卜葬忠骨</p>
<p>另一面呢，七七事變時領導蘆溝橋守軍的一一九旅旅長何基　將軍——現在徐州綏署任第三綏靖區副司令——卻以勝利者身份同河北第五區專員黃任材在一文字山的邱陵間散步，來憑弔這個戰場了。何將軍剛從徐州飛來，他這次來主要任務，是想在一文字山為九年前死在南苑抗戰的趙登禹將軍尋一塊長眠之地。趙將軍的忠骨，現在還浮厝於北平的一個廟裏。何將軍和一些老朋友，已為趙將軍呈請國葬。</p>
<h3>做美蘇間的橋樑　為世界和平確立百年大計　——論國際形勢與外交政策——</h3>
<p>— 儲玉坤</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>在現行國際情勢之下，「四海一家」還是一種理想，離開實現的時期，還有相當的距離；因此任何一個國家，任何一個民族，欲生存於這個世界上，必須有其自衛的力量。大家都知道，何衛國家生存的力量有兩種；一是有形的武力，這就是國家的軍備；另是無形的智力，這就是國家的外交。在戰爭時期，固有賴強大的軍備，在戰場上爭取一日的；但是唯力是視，不能運用智力，以外交作為軍事的先驅，猶不足以保全生存；這次世界大戰的結果，窮兵黷武的德日兩國，一敗塗地，就是一個很好例子。反之，對於軍事與外交如能兼顯並重，一方面以外交為軍事的先鋒，另一方面又以軍事為外交的後盾，雙管齊下，無往而不利。在這次大戰中的英國，軍事上雖不及納粹德國，但卒能轉敗為勝，可以說完全靠了邱吉爾的外交成功。</p>
<p>至於講到承平時期，不論是軍備或者外交，都是各國最注意的事情，以美國來說，不僅要保守原子能的秘密，而且還要把徵兵法延長，使其陸海空三軍保持戰時的水準。最近美國海際兩軍又在比基尼試驗原子炸彈，以查明原子炸彈對於海軍究有何種威力，同時美國又在外交上作種種的攻勢，不但要使聯合國機構成為維持世界和平唯一的有效工具，而且還要發起各種國際會議，提出各國國際條約，便戰後的世界逐漸安定下來，不再受戰事的威脅。美國為什麼要這樣？我們把論調提髙一點說，這是美國為了國際和平與世界安全，不得不如此；如把論調降低一點說，這是美國為了本身的安全與繁榮而出。因為美國人民沒有一個不「世界其他各國若為戰爭或內亂把摧毀，若受到發荒，貧困與疾病的威脅，那末美國也不能在她國內獨享和平與繁榮」。</p>
<p>此在蘇聯，她是一個社會主義的國家，不論在思想上或在理論上，她是另成一系統的，與英美資本主義國家，截然不同；在這次大戰中，飽受痛苦的教訓，對於保衛自已生存的兩種力量，不得不格外重視，所以戰後的蘇聯，除了埋頭於物質的建設，增強生力軍的力量而外，並致力於外交，欲將其四週的鄰邦，都做她的「安全地帶」。</p>
<p>所以在平時的國際間，「軍備競爭」與「企求安全」的外交戰，都是不可避免的。</p>
<p>回頭看我國，素以「世界大同」為理想，而以擁護集體安全制為手段，但是估計一下保衛國家生存的力量，實令人不寒而慄，先以軍備而論：今日的世界，已步入原子時代，而我們工業化的時期還沒有成熟，產業既不能工業化，所謂軍備就沒有基礎，不論陸海空三軍，都要瞠乎其後，不能迎頭趕上去，欲以武力保衛自己的生存，顯嫌不足，其次是外交，戰後中國的外交，又俳徊在華盛頓與莫斯科的歧途上。再加以自己實力不夠，而想依賴集體安全制及聯合國機構，是可恃而不足久恃的，所以今日的中國，不論是軍備或外交，都不足以保衛自己的生存，故對於當前的處境，不能不提髙警覺，隨時注意國際局勢的演變，重行攷慮我國既定的外交政策。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>我國艱苦抗戰八年，物質的條件，雖不及敵人，但至最後，卒獲勝利，這不能不說是我國外交的成功。因為在我國發動全面抗戰的時候，國際形勢並不完全有利於我國，但是我國最髙當局，洞察國內外情勢，毅然決定了五項原則。</p>
<p>（一）本獨立自主精神，聯合世界上同情於我國之國家與民族，為世界和平與正義而奮鬥。</p>
<p>（二）對於國際和平機構及保障國際和平之公約，盡力維護，並充實其權威。</p>
<p>（三）聯合一切反對日本帝國主義侵略之勢力，制止日本侵略，樹立並保障東亞之永久和平。</p>
<p>（四）對於世界各國現存之友誼，當益求增進，以擴大對我國之同情。</p>
<p>（五）否認及取消日本在中國領土內以武力造成之一切僞組織，及其對內對外之行為。</p>
<p>在這七八年的歲月之中，國際局勢，千變萬化，有時有利於我國抗戰，也有時不利於我國抗戰，但是我國外交當局，在最髙領袖之下，本著這既定外交方針，始終不渝，即所謂「以不變御萬變」，卒使不利於我的國際局勢變為有利於我的情勢。不像日寇的外交，舉棋不定，動輒得咎，甚至有時「兩面吃耳光」，一誤再誤，陷於不可挽救的困境。</p>
<p>七八年來我國在外交上的措置，不一而足，當非本文所能詳述。但是綜合起來，千言併一句，抗戰期間的外交，是完全成功的。不僅所有的措置，均能恰到好處，而且我國的理想：「對內求自立，對外求共存」，完全能做到了。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>抗戰勝利結束了，國際形勢，也跟著發生了空前的變化。因為聯合國的共同敵人，都被打倒了。於是在聯合國之間，就沒有一個共同的目標；而相互之間的利害關係，反而發生種種矛盾，戰時可以通力合作，而現在卻不能合作了；戰時能夠互忍讓，但戰後卻互相猜疑。這樣在聯合國之間。就發生了裂痕。都是非常明顯的。因此在歐洲，一再召案外長會議，始無法解決這些問題，一直到今天，才能決定於七月廿九日召開廿一國和平會議；而且它的前途很難樂觀。此在遠東，也是如此，歐洲的僵局打不開，遠東問題不能單獨解決。</p>
<p>我國在這種國際情勢之下，究竟應該採取何種外交政策呢？在原則上，是以「世界大同」為最髙理想，而以擁護集體安全制的聯合國機構為手段的。可是打採取這種手段，是否能達到這個目標？在現行國際環境之下，不是不成問題的。</p>
<p>上面已指出，戰後的國際局勢，還在動盪不定的狀態下，不論在歐洲或在遠東，都有著「分」的趜勢，而沒有「合」的現象，為什麼呢？最主要的因素，還是美蘇關係的愈趜愈遠，愈分愈疏，甚至處處站在對立的地位，好似冰和炭。積不相容。在美蘇矛盾的夾縫中，我國外交的途徑，更加狹隘了，同時「四海一家」的理想，更沒有實現的可能。</p>
<p>在現階段的美蘇關係上，美蘇兩國意見的分歧點，是很明顯的。在美國言，她要維持世界和平，擁護集體安全制；但是聯合國機構怎樣始能發生效力呢？她認為非有實力做它的後盾不可，所以她堅持著原子能的秘密，不可公開，非至蘇聯說明她對於歐洲對於遠東的領土要求之後，不能將原子能交由國際管制。此在蘇聯，認為美國保守原子能的秘密，意在威脅她，因此她感到自己的安全，漫無保障，不得不斤斤於她的「安全地帶」。同時對於聯合國機構，因為蘇聯曲髙和寡，不得不以少數制多數，堅持聯合國安全理事會常任理事國，應有使行「否決權」的權利　去十個月之中，蘇聯到處　個特權，使美國無可奈何。　以美國現正發生一種有力的國際運動，主張在任何國際會議中，均不能有否決權的存在。否則聯合國機構就不能成為維持世界和平的有效工具。</p>
<p>由此可知，今日的世界，還在戰爭與和平的歧途上，我國應該採取何種政策？確是值得研究的問題。今年一二月間，政治協商會議，也曾討論至今後的外交政策，各黨派及無黨派人士，一致同意四項原則：</p>
<p>（一）遵守大西洋憲章，開羅宣言，莫斯科四國定宣言及聯合國憲章，積極參加聯合國組織，以確保世界和平。</p>
<p>（二）根據波茨坦宣言，清算日本在中國之殘餘勢力，並與同盟共護日本問題之解決，並防止日本法西斯軍國主義勢力之再起，以保障東亞之安全。</p>
<p>（三）與美蘇英法及其他民主國，敦睦邦交，遵守條約信義，並致力經濟文化之合作，以共策世界之繁榮與進步。</p>
<p>（四）本平等互惠之原則，迅速與有關各國訂立通商條約，並改善僑胞的地位。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>這四項原則，並不新穎，且我外交當局，也早已依照著這幾個原則去幹。現在的問題，乃係在現在錯綜複雜的國際環境之下，如何去幹，始能實現我國外交政策的目標？我們特別提出下列幾點意見，以供我外交當局的參考。</p>
<p>第一，我們應該認清，在現行國際環境之下，四海一家，還是一種理想，一時不能實現，我們決不能依賴成性，專門想依賴聯合國機構，保聯我們的安全。而應該「自力更生」，以自己的武力智力來保衛國家的生存，這就是說：除了埋頭建國，充實國防，增強軍備而外，還要運用智力，發動自主的外交攻勢，不要拘泥於理想主義，一成不變；也不要處處以現實主義為出發點，只知有利，而不知有義。對於任何國際事件，都要以國家民族的利益為前提。全國人民對於內政，容有意見的不一致，但對於外交，應該有共同的主張，統一的步伐。</p>
<p>第二，中國需要和平，需要在和平的氛圍裏致力於建國復興的偉業，所以對於世界各國，希望她們能夠「合」，而不要「分」唯有「合」的國際局勢，有利於中國。尤其對於美蘇兩國，不能混和任何意氣或感情作用，而應該一視同仁。不分彼此，國民黨固然需要蘇聯的友誼，在共產黨也需要美國的好意，若有人主張反美或反蘇，對於中國均屬不利。而且，我們還可進一步，做美蘇之間的橋樑，促進美蘇兩國的諒解，釋嫌言好，共同合作，為世界和平確立百年大計。例如美國國務卿貝爾納斯最近主張在歐洲，由英美迭蘇四張，練結解除德國武裝廿五年條約，在遠東，也向中英蘇三國提出解除日本武裝廿五年條約，以防止德日兩國勢力的再起。蘇聯對此似極冷淡，我國外交黨局應該在美蘇之間盡極大的努力，從中拉攏，使這兩種條約得以同時成立，俾為歐洲和平與遠東安全，樹立兩個堅固的基石。</p>

<p>隆重的粵漢區鐵路全綫復路通車典禮，如期在七月一日舉行。　天，廣州東部（原日大沙頭站，現黃沙部改稱為廣州南站）內，佈置得煥然一新，來參與盛典的各界首長來賓千作人，將車站擠得幾乎水洩不通，大家都呈現著無限興奮和愉快的顔色。下午四時，典禮開始，該路的社局長鎮遠，因事不能來穗參加。早已有電來嘉獎全體員工艱苦完成通車任務，於是那天的典禮，便由李副局長輝祥主持。李氏將該路修築的略曆，和這次奉命趕修的經過，詳盡的報告了一番。接著省府羅主席，行營交通處長黃樹忠等致詞過後，赴會者相續的步出月台，走至那八輛編成一列的廣武列車前頭。在樂聲悠揚中，出陳市長女公子瓊英剪綵，引擎發動，那載著首批三百一十九名的列車在鞭砲聲樂聲和聲黨中，笛聲一鳴，便慢慢地直向武昌北駛，時為下午五時卅分，預期在六十八小時後則可到達武昌了。</p>
<p>會後記者即分別訪問李副局長耀祥，運輪副組長文伯常等，便我們知道了他們這次修復通車的詳細經過，和該路許多工程艱難鉅的地方。</p>
<p>先求通車徐圖完備</p>
<p>粵漢鐵路全綫長達一千零九十六公裏，橋樑計有英德橋，曲江橋等五十作座；並有髙廉村，夫沿水，歧門等十七隧道在全綫淪陷時，均分別予以破壞，所有大橋　及鋼樑，完全炸至不能再用，各隧道亦以卡車滿載鐵　駛入搗塞，然後再施爆炸，所以這些橋樑與隧道要修復，自然要相當浩大的工程。如曲江的鐵橋的橋躉，前炸毀至深一公尺，施工時正當雨季，在這湍急的濱江之上施工，其困難可以想見。又如韶關以北的高廉村，和長沙三百多公尺的山洞等，因為被破壞得體無完膚，正式修復實不容易。況且目前交通梗阻，工款接濟不容易，修築材料缺乏，現祗有一切因陋就簡，橋樑不能修復的，就暫時駕設便橋，隧道就從旁加設便綫，繞過隧道，至於枕木方面，則差不多全數取用於沿路附近的杉木，但這些橋樑根基不穩，倘遇山洪爆發，難免有沖毀之虞，待外洋鋼樑趕速運到，再架搭正橋，以期永固。同時路軌方面，因散失甚多，現一部份係由湘桂，黔桂等路移設，將來材料到達，仍須抽換的。</p>
<p>載客為主　貨運有待</p>
<p>在「先求其通，後求其備」的原則下，該路全綫已算復路通車；但由於物質缺乏，設備未臻完善，目前僅能以載客為主，貨運尚須稍待時日。現全路除每週開行廣州武昌直通車兩次外，九龍至衡陽每日經常開行物資車一次，其餘廣州至韶關，韶關至衡陽，衡陽至長沙，長沙至武昌各段，每日亦有區間車來往。廣州武昌直達特別快車，是每逢星期一四日對開，上行車二次在廣州下午七時三十分開，下行一次在武昌徐家棚開，票價業經奉令調整，三等收二萬七千六百五十元，二等加倍，頭等則二三等票價相加，即八萬二千九百五十元。另臥鋪票價是：頭等上鋪每夜國幣八千元，下鋪每夜一萬元。本來，由廣州至武昌直通車全程，預期六十八小時可抵達，但最近霉雨不絕，影響行車，或將會延至八十或九十小時始能抵達，因為廣韶段新建軌道，路基過鬆，每小時祗能行十五公里。韶武段以下，可以開行較快，每小時約達廿五公里，平均以每小時行二十公里計算，則行程亦須四天哩！</p>
<p>不出半年　恢復舊觀</p>
<p>機車是該路局目前最感缺乏的東西，據該局估計，全綫應需機車三百七十六輛，合客車三百九十輛，客車一千五百四十輛，貨車三十五輛，方可適應運輸的需要。但他們現在就殘存中拼湊中修理好的，卻祗有機車八十輛，合客車四十八輛，客車一百四十一輛，所以通車後，運輸能力有限，恐怕不能供應社會需要，是難免的事；不過，據李副局長表示：各項運輸器材如能源源供應的話，則半年後，粵路自然能完全恢復戰前狀態了！</p>

<h3>浙省公務員　生活苦?風潮多</h3>
<p>— 本報杭州一日訊　特派員儲裕生寄</p>
<p>浙江省公務員待遇，經調整後，其基本數五萬五千元，加倍數二百四十倍，相差京滬基本數一萬五千元，加倍數一百四十倍。公務員得悉待遇調整後，以杭市物價頗貴，且不亞於京滬之理由，表示並不愜意，省政府決定將浙省生活實際情形，報告中央，同時勸慰各公務員，努力從公。茲將其前情後節，彙報如次：</p>
<p>在這八九年的抗戰中，公務員們隨著浙江政府播遷了三次，由杭州到金華，由金華到方岩，由方岩到雲和，那時後有追兵，前途茫茫，不過他們有一個共同的信仰，就是「抗戰必勝！」扶老攜幼，不顧一切犧牲，走遍了崇山峻嶺，到達了浙江的邊緣。</p>
<p>勝利終於來臨了，又從浙江的邊緣扶老攜幼的回到了杭州來，這嫵媚的西子，終於仍舊得見了，待遇雖然清苦，但想這一定能夠合理解決，這暫時的現象，是不可避免的。生活高了，一切都漲價了。只累壞了公務人員，他們的待遇卻並沒有漲價，他們只期待著物價能夠平定一些，待遇能夠改善一些。</p>
<h3>霹靂一聲發宣言　要求合理新待遇</h3>
<p>果然，行政院的公務員人員待遇終於調整了，毗鄰上海，接近南京的杭州市，基本數為五萬五千元，薪俸加倍數為二百五十倍，那麼一百元底薪的公務員連頭帶尾只拿七萬九千一百元，比前增加了一萬九千元。我們觀乎此間的生活程度和上海相仿，或比南京更加超過些，而靠薪水生活的公務員，憑良心講，實在是維持起來艱難的。</p>
<p>杭州公務員得著調整待遇的消息後，由愁苦而成了共同的意念，就是要求合理待遇。省會各機關都接到一件「公務人員緊急宣言」，內容大意有：（一）我們要求合理的平等待遇，解決最低的生活。（二）我們反對這次不合理的調整――津貼倍數。（三）我們擁護上次立法院提出的調整待遇方案――生活補貼助費二十萬元，加成一千倍。（四）我們決定六月七日下午四時，在杭州市商會集會全體公教人員總請假出席。在這一個霹靂也似的號召下，下午市商會內擠滿了公教人員，足足有一千五六百人，有的慷慨陳詞，有點振奮得喉嚨都嘶了，有的提出總罷工，有的提出總辭職，有的提出總請假。</p>
<h3>調整並非好方策　尋求澈底解決法</h3>
<p>省政府得到這個消息後，各省級機關的負責人分別勸解和寬慰，但是八日的總請假終於還是實行了。省級機關的負責人，已經急電南京的沈主席請示，聽說沈主席也在南京據理陳詞。想不久也該有解決了。</p>
<p>但是調整待遇如果真的照浙江省的公務員的意見調整了後又怎樣呢？「物價」是一隻很刁滑的吃人的老虎，牠還是會舞動牠的爪牙，向公教人員撲來的。甚至牠還在暗地好笑，你們逃不出我的手掌呢？所以我們一定要注意物價上漲的原因，是不是因為物少人多的關係。關於這，記者曾和經濟學權威專家研究過，他說照杭州市的人口，和杭州市的產品，絕對不該如此漲。恐怕京滬一帶也是如此的吧。既不是自然的原因，當然有人為的原因在，這種人為的因素不根除，我們薪水階級的公務人員不知要吃虧到什麽時候呢？</p>
<p>我們很眼見政府在說：「來源充裕」，「不准漲價」，但事實上不漲自漲，這裡面到底是什麽原因呢？我看有些忍在無形中袒護奸商，有些人過且過，有些人只要自己不吃虧。原來這些都是中國人的習慣，中國人的「習慣」是不澈底的。我們要尋求病根，澈底解決，使這樣不幸的總請假事件不再發生。</p>

<p>來函更正　編輯先生：六月廿五日</p>
<p>貴報載有武君揚真通訊「防虎疫豈可分界限」一則，又六月卅日貴報蘇州通訊，謂滬市衛生局統制疫苗，禁止銷售外埠一則，查均與事實不符。謹覆如次：（一）按善後救濟總署待與本局卡車十輛，係為清除垃圾之用；又行總分署撥款二千萬元，購置防疫器材，協助地方防疫，均屬愈前局長任內經辦，大半早經交貨，惟供始交足，本人到職後，函請行總借用汽車十輛，未蒙允許，承覆「歉難照辦」。嗣再三商懇，始允每日派接送署中職員之卡車五輛，以其餘暇，接送防疫工作人員。由美軍部借用卡車十輛及消防處借用救護車二輛，在防疫總總動員事竣已全部收回。此外由美紅會借到棉花四八〇〇磅。DDT四九八〇磅，注射針頭二一〇只，及行總借到噴射器四十五只，ＤＤＴ六二五磅。均須於三個月內歸還。顯無厚薄界限之分。（二）本局所用疫苗，均由本局衛生試驗所自製，早有相當儲量，現每月仍可製造四萬劑。毋庸向市面購買。所云「統制疫苗禁消外埠」等語。絕非事實，以上二則，敬希倂賜更正為荷！張維謹啟示，七月一日。</p>

<h3>答覆讀者　法律質疑</h3>
<p>（一）蕭山周志民間　鄙友某君，在某縣於抗戰前租用房屋一棟，經營商業，當出押租法幣數百元，現在房主索房甚急，勢須退租，但戰前的法幣價格與現時之法幣價格，相差懸殊，問題就在幣值上產生。（一）政府法令解釋，如戰前以法幣一萬元存入銀行，到現在支付時，僅加利息而已，決不能以戰前的幣值折成物質，在此刻是否正確？（二）房客向房東索還押租，可否以戰前的幣值折成物質，在此刻支付時，再以今日的物價，折成幣值，以為結束手續，上述辦法，在法令上有無根據？</p>
<p>「朱亞揆律師答」雖不能依幣值折算物質，再依物質折成幣值，但應依照復員後辦理民事訴訟補條例第十二條，如顯失公平者，得請求法院公平裁量之。</p>
<p>（二）盧偉雄問　民國卅二年春，有一英商，以友情商借中儲券拾萬元，說明將來面還。有信為憑，（當時他正入集中營，米價為偽幣四百元一擔）今抗戰勝利，該英人重獲自由，現生活寬裕，但對該項借款，卻置之不理。</p>
<p>1．法律上可有規定，依今市價歸還？</p>
<p>2．若不歸還，應如何解決？可否法律起訴？手續如何？</p>
<p>請詳細回答，感激不盡。</p>
<p>「朱亞揆律師答」（一）（二）依照復員後辦理民事訴訟補充條例第十二條規定，即法律行為成立後，因不可歸責於當事人之事由，致情事變更，非當時所得預料，而依其原有效果，顯失公平者，法院應公平裁量，為增減給付或變更其原有效果之判決。君所詢可照上開條例請求法院酌量增加之。</p>

<h3>無證件學生的苦悶</h3>
<p>編者先生：今天在佈告板上看見一張佈告，其要點為「奉教育局諭，諸生之證件，務須尅日交來，以便呈報教育局查核。無證件者不能核准。若三日內不繳，以附讀生論」。糟啦，我麼沒有證件的同學，竟應受到如此的處分嗎？附讀生就是校中的附屬品，學期結束了沒有轉學證書，畢業了，又無畢業文憑，換一句話說，社會上不承認我們是個高中生，我們的求學便受到極大的影響了。證件的目的，是證明一個學生的資格程度，有什麽資格，給什麽證件，現在我們有的是資格，爲什麽不給我們該有的證件呢？再說，一張證件就能絕對保證學生的資格程度嗎？沒有資格的學生，他只要有錢啊，可以買文憑，他有朋友的面子，可以情商道轉學證書。這是社會上的黑暗面，我們自信我們的學識能夠得上水準了，這可以參考我們的小考成績。教育局要知道我們的學識如何，會考也是正當的辦法，爲什麽不採取？假使會考後我們的資歷是不夠高中一的話，留級我們也心甘願服。現在「附讀生」這個名詞，我們絕對不能承當。試問目前中國開設了多少工廠，多少公司，可以供給我們這班好像「判了死刑」沒有出路的「附讀生」工作呢？說到這裏，一定有人要責問我們了：「你們為什麽沒有轉學證書」？我可以告訴他，我們有一部份人是在偽校讀書的，「偽校」被「真校」接收了，我們就被淘汰了。還有一部份的人，戰爭期間逃難到鄉間，依然未失去讀書的素志，苦苦自修，勝利後他們沒有證書，也要受到「附讀生」的厄運了。更有一部份的人，證件遺失了，校已停辦了，無法補繳，豈不叫苦連天？有人一定又要問：「爲什麽到偽校讀書？爲什麽不到大後方去讀書？」我們唯一回答，是一句話：「沒有錢」。所謂偽校。我沒有讀到「大東亞」「日本神國」「和平建國」這一類奴化教育的書。至於「日文」，淪陷區中國人開辦的學校，幾乎沒有一校不讀「日文」的。假使不應讀日文，請教育部把現在的「德文班」都停閉了吧。淪陷區的人民，水深火熱的日子過了，現在還要受民主政府的這種打擊嗎？我們高乙級八十人中，差不多有一半沒有證書，其他各級大概也如此，別的學校有此種情形者亦正不少呢。糟呀，多多少少的青年同學們，他們的前途都將被葬送了！最後，我們懇求著教育部把這辦法緩期兩年再實行吧。素知貴報言論公正，為民喉舌。今為此文，望即披露。肇和中學高乙級無證件學生余冠鰲何志堅王金林同啟。</p>
<p>同等學力應可考大學</p>
<p>主筆先生：前些時貴報社諭談及留學生考試選拔真才問題，末段略謂，留學資格不應祗限於有文憑的大學畢業生，因為有不少苦學自修的青年，已有大學畢業的程度，而有志出國深造，但因無文憑，不能參與考試，結果還是國家認才方面的損失，故選拔真才，只要考試嚴格，何必一定要文憑。讀後，覺得十分感奮。這些都是無文憑的有志青年的腑肺之言，也可說是一種苦悶，幸經貴報鄭重提出，最近教育部頒佈留學考試資格，加入「高等考試」一項，高考時考試院考選委員會所舉行的，雖然與貴報所說尚有一段距離，但於此可見教育部也注意及此，而有所實行。因此，連帶想起大學投考資格，似宜加入「同等學力」一項。因為在此八年抗戰中，有不知多少青年失學了，直接的家園被毀，不僅失學二十流亡；間接的，因戰爭關係，父兄所人不能維一家生活。而筆者是早歲失怙的孩子，平時靠老母一些積蓄，勉強還能求學，但至物價狂漲，生活都成問題之時，也只能綴學就商了。父兄何忍令子弟受失學之痛苦？老母又何忍令筆者年青時就挑起生活之重擔？然而我們這些失學青年，都把酸淚往肚裏吞，「自願綴學」就業了。可是，業餘的補習是不會忘了的，於是像工讀，卻又不如工讀。工讀是上正式學校求學，課餘尋工作維持個人的生活，而我們卻得把所得維持一部或全部的生活費用，忙中偷閒，補習些主要科目，如國?英文之類。但高等教育，專門研究某科學術的，補習學校是沒有的。幸運的滬江東吳大夏三大學，誠明文商學院，立信會計專科學校，都有夜班的設立，純為職業青年而設。然而除了立信有「同等學力」可投考一項。此外部要文憑！國家之教育人民，猶如父母之養育子女，是責任，也是義務。人民受教育，是權利的享受。因此，國家務使每個人民都能得此全份權力，即使低能兒或聾啞者，也都要設法使之受到相當的教育。現在教部對流亡青年收留招訓，社會對無力負擔學費的家長，舉辦助學金，學校也有清寒獎學金。凡此，均欲使青年不致失學。因此，希望各有夜班的大學加入同等學力於投考資格項下。（立信專校上期已有，廿五日華美晚報有關於中央大學投考情形，投考資格項中亦有同等學力。）只要考試嚴格，不致有程度相差太遠的混入。但程度較差一些的，亦宜從寬錄取的，在第一學期試讀，試讀後發現平時成績太差，再予以補習機會，務使隨班循序而進。若試讀成績尚可，即升下第二學期正式生。如此，才不致把失學青年摒諸校外。讀者高中唐謹啟。六月廿六日。</p>

<h3>改造中國教育之路</h3>
<p>— 張文郁</p>
<p>莊澤宜著　中華書局出版</p>
<p>卅五年一月初版</p>
<p>抗戰勝利結束了，中國大局隨着世界大局改變了，中國的教育應該走向那一條路子呢？這個問題，作者在本書裏面並未指不出來。蓋因本書成於民國卅年，係作者在廿九年秋向嶺南大學教育研究生授「中國教育問題」之講稿。對於谷種教育問題，先述各問題過去解決方法及其困難與缺點，再補充作者二十年來所主張應採途徑。茲先撮述其要點：</p>
<p>（一）學術教育——作者主張大學教育應注重學術之研究，與培養技術之專門性質或職業性質之專科學校分道而馳。大學中所開功課應以教授的專長而定，不能先定課程而後强非所長的教授去擔任。因之，大學校長與教授須爲學術專家，不許政客市儈容身其間。大學學生的入學考試應該選拔眞才，不應該爲資格所限制。選派留學生出國，本來有兩種目標，一是學以致用，一是硏究學術，但自抗戰以來，乃有一種消極的留學政策，完全忽略了學術硏究。</p>
<p>（二）專門與職業教育——專科學校的性質和地位在於訓練專才，爲培養各種技術的機關。專科學校的設立應該因時因　制宜，須與中央或各省建設計劃發生密切關係。抗戰以後，後方各省設置的地方幹部人員訓練所，太着重於形式上的訓練而忽視技能的訓練。作者認爲訓練地方幹部應參考山東鄒平鄕村建設硏究院的先便，分硏究。訓練二部。中等職業人才之培養，應與公私工廠·交通·醫藥·調查·會計等機關聯繫，並普設初級實用職業學校。同時，注意職工訓練與補習教育之推進。國民師資的培養如仍採用師範學校的辦法，恐少實效。要實行三位一體制，國民及中心學校校長兼爲地方建設幹部人員，師資訓練可採取鄒平鄕建訓練部辦法，招收初中畢業學生加以訓練培養。至於各種中等學校師資的培養，普通中學師資應由師範學院培養，大學文理各系應准輔修教育十餘學分以備充作師資，職業學校之師資須由農工商專門學院培養。</p>
<p>（三）普通教育——普通中學是升學準備機關，普通中學兼作職業準備，結果兩無成就。中學旣爲升學準備機關，課程編製當以升學爲根據。畢業會考妨礙學業妨礙健康，如能嚴厲執行升級淘汰，畢業會考實無必要。現制國民教育四年，但以國家財政及國民經濟狀况而言，極難成就，如將入學年齡提高，修畢兩年，再施以補習教育，收效較宏。高小制度抄自日本，如取消高小而將中學改為八年制，初高各四年，更易收效。</p>
<p>（四）社會教育——失學民衆基本教育的普及，注重識字教育亦注重常識灌輸。民教館。圖書館。博物館等的設置，應臘到物力人力。在民教館方面，生計部份的設施更重於　文部份。電化教育欲求實施有效，須有專門人才管理，此專門人才可由各省建設學院培養之。其他如戲劇音樂，亦爲推行社教的重要工具，自須加以提倡。附論邊疆教育與羣僑教育，邊疆教育應分爲兩種，一爲邊地的漢民，一爲蒙藏回苗諸族的教育，邊地漢民教育應與本部漢人無二，各族教育，絕對以平等精神待退。關於僑教，浩標在於人才經費，治本則在於僑教設施鞏固，增進華僑地位。</p>
<p>（五）教育行政及經費——中央教育行政的權限應逐漸縮小，以期各地有更適合於當地所需教育之自由發展。省縣地方教育行政機關應有所改進，各省多設師範以負各區教育行政之職，縣以下的教育和政人員亦應使其職有所專。視察與輔導應同時推動，參議與研究機關應切實設置，教員待遇必須改善，並對教師職業有以保障，教育經費不僅需要增籌並須運用得當，私立學校應予重視並加獎勵。</p>
<p>讀完本書，有種感覺，覺得作者條分縲析，面面俱到，這是他的長處。書名「改造中國教育之路」，但改造的路向怎樣呢？作者沒有指出改造中國教育的基本趨向，也沒有提出針對中國貧·弱·愚·私的教育背景的改造方案。中國現在需要的是培養民主法治的教育，培養科學建設的教育。提倡學術須有自由發展的硏究，訓練技藝自然要以生活福利爲標的。所以，民主和科學是改造中國教育總的路向。</p>
<h3>尼赫魯自傳</h3>
<p>— 朱家慶</p>
<p>譯者：畢來　出版：新知書店</p>
<p>「印度的最終目標，是一個統一的，自由的，民主的國家：她與別的自由民族一道，密切地連繫在一個世界大聯邦之內」。——尼赫魯。</p>
<p>尼赫魯先生是印度國會黨的領袖。他一八八九年十一月十四日誕生在阿拉哈巴德。父親與伯父，都從業律師。尤其是他的父親，雖然是位崇尙英國紳士風度的印度布爾需亞，而却是一位熱心於民族獨立運動的健將，他的母親，妻子與妹妹等，在印度的獨立運動中，也都能貢獻她們的努力。這在尼赫魯先生的人格上，有着很深遠的影響。</p>
<p>尼赫魯先生的幼時年代，在一個養尊處優的環境裏生活，那時的印度人民，不僅忍受着英國壓迫的痛苦；同時還飽嘗了英印混血族以及印度社會階級的欺凌。這種種不平的現象，與慘痛的教訓；在尼赫魯先生小小的心靈上，銘刻了一個深刻的印象。</p>
<p>尼赫魯先生在十五歲的時候，就離開印度，到英國去求學。英國是一個對於政治興趣濃厚的國家，那時的印度，也不斷地在展開民族獨立的爭鬥；這就决定了他回國後的生活形態。當他在劍橋的時候，在精神上早已響應了蒂拉克的急進派，主張以英雄的姿態，反對向英國屈膝。</p>
<p>那時英國的費邊社會主義（Jabian　Social　Sm）流行一時，尼赫魯先生對牠很感興趣；這在他的政治思想上，奠定了一個基礎。</p>
<p>一九一二年秋、尼赫魯先生取得資格。回國執行祖傳的律師業務。那時正當第一次大戰爆發的前夕，民族主義與愛國思想，充溢了整個世界；印度當然也大受騷動。獨立運動由此就積極展開。隨着就是英國殘酷的壓制，促成一個劇烈的鬥爭，結果大批印度人民，慘遭殺戮或拘捕。尼赫魯先生與他的父親，看到了這種情形，就毅然放棄了職業，參加了這個印度民族的鬥爭。他們響應了聖雄甘地的文明抵抗運動；從事各種反帝國主義，反封建制度的鬥爭。</p>
<p>那時印度的政治運動，祗以布爾喬亞爲中心；而忽略了這廣大的農工羣衆。尼赫魯先生，就憑着他的大無畏精神，從事於各項農工運動；深得他們的愛戴。</p>
<p>一九二一年，由於不合作運動的蓬勃，同時各地反對英皇太子的印度之遊；構成了一次全印大暴動。國民大會的工作同志，多被逮捕。尼赫魯先生與他的父親，也就相繼入獄。這是他從事政治活動以來的第一次過這種獄中生活，因於印度革命運動的澎湃，所以在尼赫魯先生是家常便飯，隨時準備。不過他却很能利用獄中生活，以閱讀與寫作；以研究各項印度與國際的問題。</p>
<p>尼赫魯先生在政治鬥爭中，被捕入獄不下十餘次，最長的監禁，也將有三年之久，直到最近，我們還能在新聞裏讀到他被捕與被釋的消息呢！</p>
<p>尼赫魯先生曾兩度主席國民大會，也曾不少次數地担任着大會的秘書。在這個國民大會裏，有時也因政治情境的變演，分化爲「溫和派」。「急進派」，或「修改派」與「維持派」。在實際上，所謂「溫和」與「修改」也者，不過是企圖向英國妥協而已。其中當然以「分區自治主義」的呼聲爲最高。</p>
<p>分區自治主義的理論之荒個，爲尼赫魯先生等所不齒。他們以回教爲基點，强調「囬教文化」。他們認爲印度與回教之間的文化。不可調和。所以他們的結論；英國的統治，必須永遠存在於印度；俾得調和雙方文化的衝突。這種主張，眞是爲虎作倀。我們在印度獨立運動的成功上，寄以無限的憾意。</p>
<p>尼赫魯先生的政治主張，是一種澈底的革命；而不是一種表面的刷新。他爲印度所奮鬥的是完全的獨立；而決不是向英國乞憐，企圖得到幾許恩惠而已。</p>
<p>這種主張與聖雄甘地的又逈然異趣。聖雄甘地的，在注意個人在宗教上的感化；明確地說:這簡直政治宗教化。尼赫魯先生則不然；他雖然擁護聖雄甘地的革命手段，但是對於贊美「貧窮」「困苦」的「制慾主義」；對於提倡「簡樸的農民生活」；對於否認「科學足以改善人類生活」的見解，未能同意。總之，聖雄甘地的思想是純印度的，個人的，宗教的，後退的；而尼赫魯先生的思想是歐化了的，民族的；科學的，前進的。</p>
<p>賣際上，這本「尼赫魯傳記」，與其把他當作傳記看；毋寗把他當作印度民族革命史來讀，來得更較切當。當然尼　赫齊先生的這種強烈的民族意識，　愛國的熱忱，是足為我們靑年所敬的。</p>

<p>（一）「無綫電世界」月刋——這是C．A．R．L．主辦的刋物，由全國無綫電業餘家執筆，創刋於重慶，因受物質條件限制，僅發行四開報紙型一張，共同二期，勝利後，曾一度停頓。本年二月在京復刋已出四期，該刋內容較廣泛，計分專論，實騐，通訊，初學指導，珍聞，業餘風光等欄。取材較深，除無線電入門之長篇連載甚合初學者之口味外，實騐稿費較少，聞正在漸改進中，並增加實騐稿件，及參考綫路，俾有助於初學者。該刊頗多精彩稿件，值得業餘同志研究參考。</p>
<p>（二）實用無綫電雜誌——該刋創刋於戰前、上海陷落後停刋。現已於本年一月復刋，出版三期，內容亦因業餘研究受戰爭影響停頓，而缺乏實騐稿件。惟取材及編排已較載前之「　電」大加改良與充實，且趨向於無綫電理論之探討。執筆者都爲在滬之業餘家。</p>
<p>（三）業餘無綫電雜誌——這一個刋物並不是由中國業餘無綫電協會辦的，而與C．A．R．L．一無關係。它是由業餘無綫電硏究社所出版。戰前已發行，上海淪陷後停刋，本年五月復刋，內容仍與戰前無異。貧乏異常，雖多綫路圖，然均屬未經實騐之實騐稿件。效力如何未可輕信，尙望該刊能全力改善，俾有助於業餘研究者。</p>
<h3>評張東蓀著「思想與社會」</h3>
<p>— 傳統光</p>
<p>前在本刋上介招過張東蓀先生的「知識與文化」一書幷略有所評述，東蓀先生信說：「所評各端皆深中肯棨，頗爲感謝「。後來他寄來一本最近在重慶出版的「思想與社會」，係前書的績編，並且告訴我九月底再將出版「理性與民主」一書，這是他在淪陷時所寫成的三書。我們覺得在抗戰期閒張先生已經盡了他的天職，我們更希望以後張先生還能把他大部分的時間精力致力於哲學著述，這並不是不贊成張先生過問政治，不過我願意他仍舊保持哲學家的態度，而他自己也說：「哲學家本人不負行政的責任。因爲如果變為行政首領，恐怕就不能保守其理想而不能不有所遷就了。哲學家的可貴就在能於見到理想，能知何者爲眞善」。（思想與社會第一九四頁）</p>
<p>近幾年張先生所作的硏究工夫就是想從心理學，哲學和社會學三方面來建立一個完整的知識論。這一點他已在「知識與文化」一書中詳爲發揮。現在我們所要評述的「思想與社會」其目標在說明「以哲學爲代表的理論知識與有社會性的實際生活之關係究竟如何」。他在一方面是解釋理論知識如何受人類的社會生活所決定；另一方面是申述理論的玄想對於社會進展和人事行為有甚麼指導的作用。這個問題也正是本人近年來所要解答的，拙作「教育與社會改造」也正想在這方面找一條出路。不過拙作比較偏重於社會演進方面，而張先生的「思想與社會」仍比較是偏向於哲學理論方面。張先生本書的基本態度是認爲「一切已往的哲學都祗是社會思想的理論化，「而他自己所創出的一種新哲學乃是「應乎這個時代的文化需要」。總之，理論知識一方面是社會生活的產物，一方面對於社會生活又發生有指導性的影響。因而附帶的他找到了一條出路來說明何以他同時治哲學而又讀政治。</p>
<p>全書共爲九章可分爲六部分：（一）汎論人類思想的社會因素（原書第一章）；（二）說明三種知識系統；（三）哲學與社會組織的關係（原書第三第四兩章）；中國的道統—家思想和理學思想（第五第六兩章）；（五）西洋的道統—耶教思想，社會主義，和　　主義（第七第八兩章）；（六）中國文化的出路（第九章）。關於其中內容本刋前曾作過一個簡單的介紹，本文只預備直接的提出幾　加以批評。不過讀張先生的書不能支離破碎，而應作一個完整的看法，所以讀者欲了解整個張先生的思想，必須一氣讀完原書。</p>
<p>從張先生的著述中我們看得出他有兩個優點，同時也正是他的缺點。張先生的智力很高，所以往往他有很深刻的「透智」，他把握得住問題的核心；提得出豐富的見地。這是他第一個長處。可是因爲他有很高的智慧和豐富的風地，所以往往他直接了當的提出很多的結論，而忽略指示讀者一條清晰的邏輯理路，很少給我們　證的理由（Arguments）。所以當我們讀張先生的書的，隔一會兒又會跳到那兒去了。</p>
<p>其次，張先生有淵博的學識，讀書之多實在令人佩服，所以他的思想是多方面的，而意思非常複議。往往遇見了一個問題，他馬上就覺得有千言尤語滔滔不絕，傾吐不盡。結果，他會把讀者彎彎曲曲的引到莫知所止的地方。他答應讀者要解決這個問題，但是他剛說過之後，又談到另一個問題上去了。讀者覺得似乎答非所問。其實，其間未始沒有密切的聯繫，惜乎太複雜，或太冗長，使我們把握不住了。</p>
<p>張先生談中西的通統祗說到幾個支配槪念在思想史上的連繫性，至於何以這些槪念是適應當時的文化需要，它們怎樣影響當時的社會情况，張先生並沒有吿訴我們，這似乎不甚符合全書的主旨。</p>
<p>最後，關於中國文化的出路，張先生祗着重於士階級（即知識份子），似乎只要他們做社會的出氣筒，對於全文化有所貢獻，「把文化自身所有的化爲殭石之趨勢不斷加以撓阻」，這個民族就可以復興起來。這一點我不敢相信。我們民族性自有其生活背景的。假使生活背景不改變，只靠一般士階級發發淸議，我認爲民族是沒有法子改進的。在我看起來，假使政治不上軌道，經濟生活不改善，即使「教育公會」順利的成立，至多不過養成一般書呆子。要知道假使蜜蜂不採花蕊，而吃樹根，它們是釀不出蜜來的，一個知識份子或一羣知識份子在在一個吃不飽，餓不死，整日爭權奪利的政局之下，絕造不出新血液來的。當然，我幷不是說思想對於社會情境沒有影響，不過欲替一種文化找出路，除思想的激勵之外非在政治經濟社會風氣各方面同時角工夫不可。</p>
<h3>「早戀」讀後</h3>
<p>— 鄭家璦</p>
<p>拉維姆·夫雷雅曼（RuvimFrayerman）是一位多才的，年輕蘇維埃小說家；他初次　動蘇維埃讀者的，是一篇講到中國東三省革命青年的長篇小說，名曰：Vassaka　Red　Partisan。一九四〇年他的第一部鉅作Early　live「早戀」已被譯成英文，刋在「國際文學」（Intermational　Literatue）第一·二·三月號上；後來，這篇小說，曾經改編爲新劇，在「莫斯科少年觀衆劇院」上演。一九四一年春天，由胡山源先生譯成中文，介紹給我國讀者。</p>
<p>「早戀」的題名，很容易使人誤他爲一本「純愛情」的曠世悲劇，可是你讀了以後，才會發覺這裏並沒有曲折離奇的傳奇小說；正如譯者所說的：「你如抱了什麼「奇情」或「艷情」的心思，來看牠的情節，你是會失望的，你還得用欣賞一篇絕世妙文的結構的眼光來看牠，你才會如願以償，滿載而歸。。」；誠然，這是文藝品中，不容忽視的一部好小說，作者的特點，是「富於抒情的語句和心理的分析。」「早戀」是以兒童爲主人翁的，夫雷雅曼在描寫這幾個兒童「雕像」時，充份發展了他的天才和聰明，最平淡的故事原是最雋永的，也是最生動的；「早戀」裏尋找不出「愛」，或「喜歡」等二字眼，可是整個故事中，却處處洋溢了不滅的友情和愛。</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>丹雅，那個剛滿十五歲的女孩子，一向是南奈少年斐爾加的好朋友，每年夏季剛盡，野營生活結束的時候，他們就回到家裏來，等候另一個學期的開始。</p>
<p>丹雅和她的母親，還有一個老保姆住在一起，她小小的家裏永遠是很平靜的，母親是醫院中的好助手，丹雅在學校裏讀書，可是她不滿足，不愉快，因爲她從來沒有見過他的父親，——現在他住在老遠的莫斯科，愛着另外一個婦人，在許多年前，丹雅還是嬰兒的時候，他就和牠的妻子分手了</p>
<p>這一次，丹雅剛從野營歸來，她在無意之中，發現了父親寄來的一封信，是給她母親的，說是快要回來了，並且還帶了他的情婦和情婦的姪兒叫高里雅的一同來。她帶着喜悅的心情，在那個淸晨上趕到碼頭，去迎接父親，可是等船上的旅客走盡了，她找不到所要接待的人，只好怏怏而返，臨去時牠把百合花放在睡在舁床上的男孩身旁，牠低低地飲泣了，誰知這男孩就是高里雅。</p>
<p>父親終於來看丹雅了，她得到時了無限的喜悅，然而父親還是和情婦住在別處，丹雅的心情是凄苦的。</p>
<p>在學校裏，斐爾加原是丹雅的好友，自從高里雅進來了，他却更能使丹注意着她傾心於他，斐爾加感到難堪的痛苦，可是並不去傷害他們的友情，他寳愛丹雅，勝過自己；雖然丹雅不像先前那樣鐘情了。</p>
<p>節日，新年，許多開心的日子過去了，在一次猛烈的風暴下，丹雅爲了救獲高里雅，遭遇到困難，幸得斐爾加領着衆人去援救，他們才得脫離危險。斐爾加一直是個良善的少年。</p>
<p>最後，丹雅决心捨棄戀愛，爲了她唯一母親的幸福，她離開了那二個男孩子；可是他們之間，誰都忘不了誰，丹雅永遠是他們心目中的好朋友。</p>
<p>「早戀」的作者，憑着他精確的心理分析和優越的技術，把一幅色彩鮮明的圖畫，呈現在我們眼前，雖然這故事的背景是在冰雪嚴寒的北國，雖然主角們的個性是那樣粗野，剛愎，雖然裏面沒有動人偉大的塲面；「早戀」依舊是美麗的；起這個名字，就可以令人回憶到那裏的氣氛：兒童們所愛的河在黑沉：長滿樅樹的山間流着，螞蟻爬滿在粹樹皮上，孩子們用着雪白的牙齒在咀嚼樹脂，他們更喜歡吃鹿肉，冬天的時候，大雪掩蓋了廣闊的平原和山崖。有時應有可怕的風暴來臨這本小說不僅渲染了濃厚的地方色彩，最不能忽略的就是心情方面的描摹；我們知道兒童最後一個時期的心理，頂複雜，微妙；修養較差的寫作者，很難能生動地刻劃出來，然而夫雷雅曼是成功的，他寫得細膩又美，許多婉麗的詞旬，很自然的流露出來，像深山中的潺潺溪水，你的心情就隨著牠飄逸到那個境地去，於是你好像淸淅地看見了那地方的山，水，草木，風雪和禽獸，你的情緒更緊緊地爲孩子們的喜悅和悲哀所扣住了，擺脫不開。當丹雅第一次靠近他父親的身旁時，作者這樣寫着；</p>
<p>「她輕輕地靠着他的肩頭。</p>
<p>「你都吿訴我聽，也許我能够幫你，什麼事情爲難你，你心裏有什麼事？」</p>
<p>但是她不說什麼，因爲那時她所想的是：「我有一個母親，一個家，一頓飯，甚至一條狗和一頭貓，但我却沒有父親…。」</p>
<p>她只向他擠緊些，靠着他的胸間。</p>
<p>可是，啊，擠靠在父親的胸間，那是何等地甜蜜呀！躍然現在不是春天，雖然在寒雨之後，這裏戶外很潮濕，雖然在單薄的衣衫之下有一些寒戰，可是即使在這深秋的傍晚，丹雅也覺得了溫暖？她和她的父親同坐了好久，直等到她自己所愛的羣星光彩，照到了往堡壘去的道路，照到了洒着石灰的小徑，照到有玻璃門的房子。」</p>
<p>下面是描寫丹雅的畫夢：</p>
<p>「…那末今天發生了些什麼事情呢？是不是那長流入海的江河，將這些奇異的想頭放進了她的頭腦裏？她曾帶着模糊的預覺，注視着這河流，她曾希望和牠一同浮着，可是往那裏去呢？爲什麼澳洲野狗的思想那樣誘惑着她呢？澳洲野狗干她什麼事呢？這是不是由於她的兒童時代正在稍稍地溜去了？誰能確實知道，什麼時候兒童時代會結束而下一個時代會開始？……」</p>
<p>後來，丹雅要離開她的老家了，斐爾加知道了這消息非常難堪，他用白紙裁成了五個字母「Tanya」（丹雅）放在胸脯上，每火讓太陽去晒灼着，結果，他的身上留下了白色的名字。他被丹雅看到了：「你是這樣一個小孩子，斐爾加，可是冬天一來，你穿上了煖衫，牠就要完全褪去了。」斐爾加的面色沮喪起來，他惶惑地看過四週的天，熱沙和河在山嶺間爍着，好像是一個黃金的山谷。他心頭的煩亂到了極點，他完全忘記了冬天，他向灼人的太陽露出他的身體時，一些也沒有想到冬天。</p>
<p>「喔，我是一個什麼樣的　子呢！」他哭着說。</p>
<p>「但是太陽是那樣的有力，他固執地說「牠不會完全消滅的吧。也許有什麼東西會留下來的丹雅？」他懇求着。</p>
<p>丹雅想了一下就同意了。</p>
<p>「你是對的」她說，「有些東西是一定會留下來的。一切都要消滅，這是不會的。否則對於我們永遠的友誼，那裏說得過去呢？」</p>
<p>這兩個兒童擁抱了煖熱的空氣扇著他們的面頰，孤單的鳥從牠們高高的枝頭探出頭來看着牠們。</p>
<p>兒童時期已經終止了！可是恰在什麼時候呢？誰能够替他們解決這個謎呢？不是沙，不是森林不是石頭，那些都是常和他們在一起的。……」</p>
<p>「早戀」是一本精湛的小說，我願意介紹給愛好文藝的讀者們。</p>

<h3>略談小說的技巧</h3>
<p>— 胡山源</p>
<p>最近道幾個月，曾經發一個狠，將所有新出版各雜誌上的長短篇小說，都看了一遍。所得的結果是這樣：</p>
<p>凡是正規的小說，就是登載在正規雜志上的小說，除了極小部分略帶娛樂性或宣傳性以外，其內容大都可以稱頌，有可貴的主題，會使人鼓舞·奮發·或深思。然而其技巧，却適得其反，可以和最優秀或最新式的技巧相比的，簡直寥寥無幾，大都不是頭重脚輕，便臃腫畸形，或說書·或談情·或致介紹詞·或撰說明書，不像在寫小說。倒反是若干娛樂性雜誌上所登沒有嚴肅的深刻的內容的小說，會有極可令人滿意的技巧：眞可以當得骨肉停勻，銖輛悉稱的評語。</p>
<p>爲什麼會有這種現象呢？當然，與其內容不佳，還不如技巧不佳。內容佳，到底沒有浪費筆墨，單單技巧佳，決不是小說應有的使命。然而有了好的內容，再配上好的技巧，那又是何等美滿的事情呢！而且，有了好的技巧，要安上好的內容，很不容易，因爲內容是如可以强求的，而技巧只是經騐和工夫，有了好的內容要獲得好的技巧，却並不困難。現在好的內容沒有好的技巧配上去，其理由也許就是這幾點：</p>
<p>一是過份强調內容的重要，而忽視了技巧。如果有內容的作者能够在技巧上多注意一些，一定就可以解決技巧上的種種困難和缺點。一是根本看不起技巧。這只有請道種作者很够消除他的成見。一是作者不知道怎樣寫才會合格。道也並不困難，只要多參考些擅長技巧的作家和作品就可以知道。</p>
<p>已往，魯迅和葉紹鈞的短篇小說，都可以作爲技巧的範本。長篇小說則以茅盾的技巧比較地最成功。如以國家而論，那就很多了，較遠些的莫泊桑不必說，較近些的高爾基都很合格，最近的作家也大都可以效法。（正言報上登的「凱旋門」，實在是很好技巧的標本，登的時候沒有多人注意，現在竟不登了，很可惜！）</p>
<p>最近幾年來，就上海而論，小說寫得好的，就是有正當的內容和優秀的技巧的，有這幾個人：如像沈寂·石琪·郭朋·湯雪華。現在石琪還看得見他的作品，其他諸人都看不見了，不知道他們還在寫吾。我沒有捧他們的意思，有心硏究的人，不妨將他們的作品找出來看看。</p>
<p>現在在內地的老作家都在逐漸回來了，我希望不久就可以多多看見於內容之外在技巧上令人滿意的小說。</p>
<h3>幻滅（小說）</h3>
<p>— 君平</p>
<p>劉淸華從大後方回來後的第一件大事便是宣吿失業。</p>
<p>妻感到很焦灼，他自己也很焦灼，暫時的生活雖還能維持，但以後下去怎麼辦？過去在大後方教書，生活雖然淸苦，終還能硬着頭皮活下去，現在簡直連如何活下去都大成問題。而且在後方的最初三年，劉清華還是一個單身的飄泊者，現在他已經是二個孩子的父親，他想不到從昆明回到上海後居然會無事可做，他更想不到現在的生活情况比過去幾年中最狼狽的時候還要狼狽。</p>
<p>妻不僅是一個宿命論者，而且還是一個非常善良的女人，她對於現狀毫無怨言，但她對於孩子們的缺乏營養，卻不能不感到焦慮，這些情形都使劉淸華感到難以形容的內疚，他覺得她和孩子們都是無辜者，她們不應當這樣受罪，他旣然做了人家的丈夫和父親，即使在道義上也應該維持她們，何况他今天所要盡的責任，決非僅止道義上的責任。</p>
<p>大淸早他走出門口就看見妻和聘聘，甜甜二個孩子站在弄堂口，聘聘看見他爸爸走來，就一把拉牢他的長衫：「爸爸替聘聘帶個洋娃娃來。」</p>
<p>「好的，好的，」</p>
<p>「爸爸，囡囡也要糖糖喫。」甜甜也走過來拉牢他。</p>
<p>「準定帶來，準定帶來。」</p>
<p>「你們不要拉牢爸爸的衣服，爸爸等會就要帶來給你們的。」妻奔過來解了他的圍。</p>
<p>像這樣的空頭支票，他對孩子們不知開過多少次了，後來連孩子們都對他的諾言表示懷疑起來。有一次聘聘對他說：</p>
<p>「爸爸，隔壁的小妹妹昨天買了一輛小汽車，你爲什麼不替我買個洋娃娃呢？」</p>
<p>「爸爸準定替你去買。」</p>
<p>「爸爸說話不算數，到底幾時去買？」</p>
<p>到底幾時去買？實在連他自己都毫無把握，但他不願看見孩子的失望表情，他儘可能還是騙着他們，雖然孩子們被騙已經有着說不淸的次數；</p>
<p>「明天去買，一定明天給你去買。」</p>
<p>天天說明天，然而天天沒有買回來，孩子們雖不懂得世故，但經騐吿訴他們爸爸的話說過算數，從來沒有實現的日子，劉淸華心裏很苦痛，但嘴裏不便說什麼，也不能說什麼，他以爲連孩子們這一點起碼的要求都無法如願，實在太對不住他們，但今天不要說是洋娃娃，就是日常生活所必需的柴米油鹽都弄得焦頭爛額，那末孩子們這種額外的要求出諸敷衍態度，似乎也不能說是過份。</p>
<p>晚上他從街頭踱回去的時候孩子們都已睡覺，妻坐在床邊沿上看書，沉默中似乎還帶着點挹鬱。</p>
<p>「徐校長今天去看到嗎？」妻表示非常關懷。</p>
<p>「看是看到的，不過……」他的神色不很好：「不過看到他和不看到他其實並沒有二樣。」</p>
<p>「爲什麼？他不能替你設法？」</p>
<p>「他說這一學期，已經無法可想，下學期教師如有缺額，一定替你設法安插，這話不是等於不說嗎？下學期離現在還有六個星期，你看我們這些錢能不能維持六個星期？」</p>
<p>「節省一些的用，四個星期或者還能勉强敷衍。」</p>
<p>「求人不如求己，與其打拱作揖的託人帮忙，要求援引安插，還不如自己去找職業，路是由人們走出來的。你說是不是？」</p>
<p>妻點點頭，因爲她實在無話可說，這許多日子中，劉清華不是不在謀事，可是除了換來冷諷熱嘲以外，便是一味的敷衍，人一窮即使是平時熟悉的親友也會陌生起來，如果人間確實還有溫情的話，也僅僅聞之於耳，而並沒有見之於目。現在不僅劉清華對於人世間的許多事物開始懷疑，就是妻對於託人找事也覺得很少樂觀成份。然而妻還是不得不問他：</p>
<p>「你說自己去找職業，怎樣去找呢？」</p>
<p>「我今天看到報上有一家企業公司要聘請文牘，待遇除月薪二十萬元外，還供給膳宿，我很去試一試，不管成功不成功。」</p>
<p>妻聽了很興奮，因爲她知道他對於文牘工作並非外行，此去雖不能說有什麼把握，但在許多沒有把握的事件中，這件事似乎多少還有點把握。</p>
<p>第二天早晨劉清華匆匆的趕到大勝企業公司，那家企業公司借了人家的一間右廂房在辦事，規模小得可以，他走進右廂房，僅僅看見二個油頭滑腦的小伙子坐在沙發上聊天。</p>
<p>「請問，這裏是大盛企業公司嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的，你貴姓？」</p>
<p>「我叫劉清華，你們這裏是不是聘請文版？」</p>
<p>「不錯，劉先生來應徵，我們很歡迎，不過我們過去並不認識，對於劉先生我們照規矩應當考騐一下．」</p>
<p>「那當然，那當然。」</p>
<p>經過筆試和口試以後，一個小伙子到外面去喊了一個穿西裝的大塊頭來，那個大塊頭自稱是大盛企業公司的總經理，他看了看劉清華的筆試後，很客氣的說：</p>
<p>「劉先生對於文牘確有相當經騐，欽佩得很！我們公司裏的業務近來非常發達，這一次準備錄取八個文牘來辦理本公司所有的文書工作，這裏臨事辦事處立刻就要結束，我們已經在環龍路頂下一座大洋房，五天以後就要搬到那邊去辦公。」</p>
<p>劉清華發覺他多少有些語無倫次，因爲他說了一大套話，並沒有把要說的話說出來，這話就是劉清華究竟有沒有被錄取？他索性直截了當的問他。</p>
<p>「那末你看了我的筆試，當然可以知道我有沒有被錄取的可能？」</p>
<p>「那還用說嗎？」大塊頭拍拍他的肩膀：「當然錄取，當然錄取，待遇一項現在暫定二十萬元，不久就要提高，我們這裏每年年底還有花紅可分，花紅的數目是很可觀的，去年本公司的職員每人都分到十二個月花紅，比方說你劉先生的薪俸是二十萬元，到了年底就可分到二百四十萬元的花紅今年本公司盈餘比去年恐怕還要多，花紅的數目當然也隨着這個比個增加。」</p>
<p>「那末我甚麼時候起到公司裏來工作？」</p>
<p>「最好明天就來，」大塊頭表示很關切：「明天來時順便帶三百萬元現鈔來。」</p>
<p>「爲甚麼？」他感到很詫異</p>
<p>「我們這裏的職員一律都是現金保的。」</p>
<p>「舖保不可以嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，這是本公司用人的章則，章則是不能隨便修改的。」</p>
<p>大塊頭的的話雖然說得很漂亮，但經騐告訴他這是一幕佈置周詳的活劇，如果不要三百萬元，即使浪費時間和精神，他或者也會去試一下，以廣見識，然而三百萬元那裏可以去張羅呢？</p>
<p>在歸去的途中，他的心沉重得像一塊鉛石。……</p>

<h3>雙宿雙飛（八一）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>直奉之戰發生了！</p>
<p>于是各業停頓，紛紛逃奔外鄉。麗華所在的戲園子全班同行，由張弦領導，避向華中一帶，順便作跑馬頭的演出。麗華自然不能離開這個組織，墨太太，以及麗雲，都參加了張弦的團體。他們乘津浦車到了徐州。就在這兒停下來，和一個戲園千訂了半年合同。</p>
<p>這是廣華粉墨生涯的流浪第一頁。</p>
<p>換了一個新環境，便不免有一些新的煩惱。關華身爲戲班的「台柱」，總不能不應酬應酬地方人士，此所謂「拜碼頭」。幹這行，不這樣作，就會有許多麻煩。麗華只好咬着牙週旋一番，她開始感到：唱戲並不簡單，當台柱更不簡單。她以前祗知道唱戲就是盡義務，義務之外沒有別的了。如今才知道「義務」之外，還有責任—交際人事關係的責任。從這裏又增加了麗華很大的痛苦，她可以對同行們尊嚴；對張弦尊嚴；甚而對墨太太尊嚴；但却不能對一個新環境的社會人士—軍閥；官宦；紳士；名流；有錢有勢的大爺們尊嚴！她得向這些人謙虛，恭敬；她得向這些人拍萬，吹牛；她得向這些人獻媚，討好；她得向這些說說笑笑！儘管她自己不直接這樣表現，而張弦墨太太會代她這樣表現。她像一個淪落異鄕的叫化子，她伸着手；屈着膝；向這些人要飯吃！而且是替許多人要飯吃！她雖然覺得比唱戲的羞辱還要羞辱，可她只有「閉着眼睛」承受下來！</p>
<p>在徐州，麗華依然很紅，紅得像「天上的星星」！紅得多少大爺們着了迷，年老的要認她作乾女兒，年少的想和她交朋友。哪裏是什麼「認乾女兒」？哪裏是什麼「交朋友」，都不過想藉口一親芳澤罷了。</p>
<h3>心鄉</h3>
<p>— 凌羽</p>
<p>從蘇北出走，一眼已經半年了。</p>
<p>這半年來我們一家分在三處，每逢看到亮晶晶的月半的夜月，的確要使人記憶起白居易的「一夜鄕心五處同」的詩句。</p>
<p>戰亂使人流浪，使人瀕於絕境，也使人的心變得更其煩躁與零落，每當看到又一批的人從蘇北　出來的慘景時，我眞不敢相信中國還是什麼「五强」之一，中國還有什麼「大國民」。</p>
<p>慢慢的我對鄕愁只有成爲幻滅。</p>
<p>這兩天已經是黃梅時節了，我寄居的地方，一到傍晚遠遠近近傳來不斷的蛙鳴，彷彿在自己家園躺在籐榻上仰首看天河時的一幅景像，但我坐的却是從鄰居家借來的竹櫈，身旁是一塊被敵寇八年前轟掉的殘垣！遠望出去全是頹壁，沒有一處整齊的房舍，南風吹來，有時就帶著一陣令人作嘔的霉臭味，據說在附近的幾塊廢瓦堆里就被鬼子活埋過不少靑年男女。這是一所遭受敵人摧毁最慘的小城池。</p>
<p>我看到這一派斷垣殘壁，怎不叫人對遙遠的蘇北平原鈎起無限懷念的鄉心？</p>
<p>昨天接到妻子的信，她吿訴我在另一塊城池帶着兩個孩子在高物價下挨命，她說：「這麼大熱天，兩個孩子，一步不離的要照應他們……」她又說：「勝利後六個月的流亡，就好像又加多了六年淪陷的苦難生活。」信末附着八歲大孩子的兩行字，孩子寫着：「爹爹，你在外頭可好？你可想家，想家里桃樹上的桃子」嗎？</p>
<p>我讀了這兩行字，不禁一眶熱淚潤濕了眼皮，孩子天眞的語言感動了我，是的，我實在想家，由於孩子的喚起，我想到我家屋後園子里的桃樹，那是由丁家所一個農園里移植過來的改良種水蜜桃，近四年來一到五月，總是結得累累實實的，孩子實貝它，輕易不肯送人，除非他喜愛的長輩和他的小朋友，可是今年正當桃　結實的時候，我們一架都離開了那所寄居近卅年的古屋和一處小小的後園。</p>
<p>我拿起筆寫什麼話安慰孩子哩？但我終於寫著：「孩子，馬上可以回家了，你要吃桃子，請媽媽買給你吧！」我明知這句話對天眞的孩子是一種欺騙，我曉得戰亂的烽火還不會被撲熄。</p>
<p>想到這里，我的心越加沉重，可是我却衷誠的祈望着正和平的實現，一種濃烈的渴念的鄕心又起伏着！</p>

<p>住在大都市里，每天看到的是鱗鱗比比的蜂窩似的高樓大厦，灰色的水門汀地，烟一樣的混雜着細粒的煤屑的塵埃，還有，那成千成萬鑽動着的人頭。……聽到的儘是汽車喇叭聲，喧囂的人聲，每當早晨，倚在高樓的窗邊，睜眼向遠天眺望，想從遼遠的地方找尋一些綠色，來潤澤一下久枯的心靈，可是那更高大的巨獸似的矗立着的她築物，卻殘酷地用灰色的陰影把尋夢者的眼睛掩遮了。悠長的歲月像一隻沉重的、鐵輪，緩慢地滾過去，希望，懷戀和渴慕黏在這輪圈的鐵齒上，被碾軋出一道鮮紅的血痕！……</p>
<p>都市生活是多麼使人厭倦呵！那巨獸似的樓厦，灰色的烟塵和灰色的水門汀地……：人們永遠看不到那一片綠色的原野。在這都市的外圍，躺着混濁的江水，帶一樣迂伸到遼遠的天邊，隔斷了旅人的遐思。每天侷促地生活在蜂窩似的樓房里，眷念着鄉土的消息，渴慕着孰諳的無垠的綠色；蓊鬱的松柏，嫋娜的柳枝，和柔軟的芳草，有時思想給痛楚攪得紛亂了，偶而鑽出斗室，步出大厦，獨自向江邊走去，鵠立岸旁，希望能看到一堆從遠方隨晚風飄過來的桑梓的雲彩，但，江水的呻吟嗚咽，却把旅人從記憶里拉回來，像許多尖針，刺痛了我的心靈！</p>
<p>在孤獨，抑鬱的包圍里，我打發了一連串的日子，幾乎是每天，而且是常常，我渴慕着遠方原野的綠色，爲着綠色的渴慕，在一個昏暗的落着狗子毛一般的細雨的午夜，我悄悄地用手帕拭去從眼角滾下來的熱辣的淚水。</p>
<p>年靑的時候，像一隻燕子，到處飛翔，從這一城市到那一城市。那十餘年的時光，替我的生命史上留下了珍貴的一頁。每年的假期，是爲旅人轉換生活環境而排定的，都市的日子過得膩煩了，又像燕子似的振起自山的雙翅起始飛翔，飛到自己的鄕土，投入原野的懷抱，親吻那一片綠色的土地！蓊鬱的綠，嫋娜的綠，柔美的綠，……給予我和平恬靜的感覺，在我的心靈的深處刻土幽美而又溫馨的綫紋，在我的身畔描繪着靜麗的圖畫，可是，想不到有一天，綠在我身邊褪色了。留下的是一縷迷離和悵惘。</p>
<p>戰爭的火炬在古老土地的每個角落燃起了，千萬無無辜者的血匯成一道紅色的浪，滲人祖國的原野，綠色的鄕土和南北東西的角落一樣，在火藥味的彌漫里，在每個渴慕綠色的人的身邊，消失了它和平，莊嚴、溫馨而又靜麗的丰姿。帶着迷離和悵惘，別離了父母妻兒，依戀地走出故園，踏着芳草，穿過松柏，又像燕子似的向遠方飛翔，可是從那一回，燕子的雙翅變得沉重了，失去了年靑時的輕盈和活潑，而且從那一回，一離開鄕土就是好幾個年頭。</p>
<p>八年的亂離，　風宿露，越山踄水，在風沙中顚沛，從一個陌生的鄉鎮又到一個陌生的城市。流浪人裹着沉痛和悲酸挨過一串悠長的歲月，在黝黑的長夜跋跡了一程沙漠的行旅。</p>
<p>這其間，天天做着絲色的夢，渴望着能有這麼一天、躺在原野的懷抱里，狂熱地吻着那綠色的胸膛，用我誠摯的淚水洗凈她腥汚的血痕！治好她被蹂躪的創傷！</p>
<p>終于黎明降臨了，勝利的呼聲到處飛揚。迎着晨曦，拖着疲乏沉重的脚步，流浪人又來到這一個熟悉的大都市，溫度的倦憊，當第一次小心地拂去衣衫的風塵時，內心揪起難言的喜悅。度挨了八年悠長的歲月呵，興奮的熱淚隨着微笑掛下來。綠色的記憶起始在面前幌動。</p>
<p>我要奔向原野去！</p>
<p>可是黎明後的迷霧却蒙蔽了我的眼睛，一陣暴風雨，壓斷了燕子的疲憊的雙翅。有家書自遠天來，吿訴我四年前老家已經被毁滅，原野上現在還繼續搬演着殺人的故事；那是更殘酷的人間的悲劇！家人們都好，三個孩子都長得很結實，不過在新舊創傷塗滿了褪了色的綠的原野上，他們過着每况愈下的日子，生活得更痛苦。…</p>
<p>我不明白那是怎樣的一幕殘酷悲劇的連續？</p>
<p>希望給碾得粉碎，悲哀，痛楚人我的情緒里。裹着更深的創痕，我提起脚步走了。</p>
<p>綠色的渴慕像毒蛇咬嚙着我的靈魂，一顆心像一張黃色的枯葉。隨著風雨的剝蝕，深切的渴　又仿佛泥沼似的，陷落下去。</p>
<p>可是，生活在都市的蜂窩似的高樓的斗室里，　丁在灰色的水門汀地上，一片日夜無休止的喧囂聲里，你能向那兒去找絲綠色的潤澤呢！</p>

<h3>米蛀蟲</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>外國人發明了DDT,中國人却另有妙用，用以自殺，這是出乎發明人意想之外的。有一位仁兄說：連自殺還要用外國貨，真是洩氣！</p>
<p>凡百事體，上海人的確都得風氣之先，有DDT自殺，這也是時髦也，截至現在止，報紙上已出現過兩件這樣的新聞，其一，業已鳴呼哀哉，另一，祇說危在旦夕，下文如何，尚不得而知。DDT殺蚊蟲蚤虱，原來也同樣能殺人的。</p>
<p>提起殺蟲，DDT却有一個意外，它對於一種虫是無可奈何的，這一種虫就是米蛀虫。</p>
<p>我有一個朋友，對於生物學特別有興趣，他為了試驗DDT的殺傷力，特別搜集了臭虫，蚊蚋，跳蚤，蟲虱，蜈蚣，百脚，蟋蟀，蚯蚓，米蛀，…各種虫類，用DDT加以掃射，在掃射之下，立時所有的虫類都停止活動，奄奄一息，而且逐漸斃去。朋友並沒有丟掉他們，仍舊放在那里，看第二天如何。</p>
<p>第二天，再去看時，所有的虫類都死去了，惟有米蛀蠕蠕地在這些虫屍中活動，大概想找點喫的，而且顯得格外神氣。期意若曰：又將奈我何？</p>
<p>這是朋友的報告，絕對真實的一個報告，如有不信，好在這兩天正是黃梅天氣，米蛀虫多的是，大家儘可以實地試驗一下！</p>
<h3>也談自卑</h3>
<p>— 墨萸</p>
<p>讀了前兩天本欄關於「自卑」的幾篇文章後，不禁使我想起下屬對於上司的「自卑」來，我想對酉廷君有一點補充：</p>
<p>一個人不是生來就具自卑感的，試看年青人十九都有一股初生之犢的自命不凡的憨勁，但是這種憨勁在踏入社會後就會因種種打擊而不得不自動的揣摩校正，酉廷君把自卑的養成歸罪於家庭中的父母，其實做父母的沒有不酷愛自己子女能夠自傲而感至慰藉的，祇是自己是識途老馬，曉得社會上任何階層都不允許你先從「自卑」做起，所以不能不想法用訓誡，誘導去壓抑兒女們向「自卑」就范，曾國藩諄諄告誡子弟的家書，也就是他從湘勇團練爬上京朝都堂的一生的辛酸的經歷，他知道社會祇是容許自卑者立足的，因此雖貴為一品，依然要學「自卑」；他晚年功成之後，偶然興至諷刺了左宗棠幾名閑話，歷史家就替他寫了：「休休有容，寗無慚德」。你縱有匡危扶傾的汗馬功勞也還得要「自卑」，否則你就失去了「風度」，就是懂做人的道理！</p>
<p>記得我在離開學的時候，幾個前業同學就很善意的規勸過我用「自卑」去爭取上司青睞的秘訣；等我開始服務之後總覺得這真是金玉良言。你如果天真，有點憨勁，那簡直是每天要碰上無數軟硬釘子。上司都是萬能的，縱然他有不懂或稍為尷尬的地方要來就教你，你千萬不能直接了當的挺起胸去接受，你要受寵若驚的誠惶誠恐的表示我原來也是不十分懂得或是會做的，但是我將竭盡所能效忠於這一件事，等辦完之後你還得裝出汗流浹背但恐尚未臻妥當的窘態去請示，上司明知道這是故弄玄虛，但他一定非常欣賞你這副俯首貼的自卑的神情，你就因此可以得到青睞，就不定上司在空下來的時候要來找你聊天，下棋，那你就要隨時留意，處處自卑，因為自卑纜可以襯托出你的上司是如何的英明和飽學。</p>
<p>我很喜愛軍隊裏長官責罰士兵們的場面，當長官叱吼着：「你暈混蛋傢伙！」士兵們一定高聲挺胸應着　：「是！」這已經不是「自卑」了，這是忠實，服從，有禮貌；「自卑」在這裏已經昇畢，這種自卑是率真，不虛偽，有人性！</p>
<p>沒有錢，沒有勢的人都是要自卑的，酉延君說這是嚴重的心理病，但是我認為毋　說它是嚴重的社會病。</p>
<p>寫到這裏，想起上次美國在滬的一個上等兵謁見他們的陸軍部長，上等兵能夠見着部長，部長能夠和他握手，兩者之間都有勇氣去陳述，傾聽。我真有點神往了。</p>
<h3>電子絨毯</h3>
<p>— 知微</p>
<p>電子科學發明之電子器具，已有多種。便便利於日常生活之應用者仍寥若晨星。最近美國西門公司，發明一種電子絨毯，（Electronic　Blanket）業已試驗成功，並將大量出產。每條價疲於美鑫四十元。此物於一九四六年春問世，毯分二層，中間逢有二根繞在一起之電綫；一以通電，使絨毯發熱；另一則連接一三管之溫度調節器，以測毯中溫度，而加以調節，試以調節器之針指着七十八度，而室內降低，則測溫之電綫能使大量電流通過，絨毯因以加熱。如室內溫度增加時，則此絨毯能自動減低溫度，至標準七十八度為止。當吾人夜間之體溫略降時，此毯亦能自動增加溫度，如此則可避免夜因着涼而思增被之煩。電子絨毯甚輕，故可使人安睡，亦可預先熨熱牀被，實為冬季怕入冷被者之福音。</p>
<p>此種電子絨毯之功效，可以下列二種試驗證明之：一。如以多數電子燈照射之，此毯熱度大增，但經調節器之作用，仍能保持七十八度之正常溫度，且所費電流僅十瓦特。二，如毯上鋪滿冰塊，溫度大減，但經調節器作用毯內溫度亦自動升至七十八度，惟所耗電流達一百九十八瓦特。</p>
<p>電子絨毯雖用電流發熱，因裝置嚴密，絕無觸電之危險，輕便舒適，無與比倫。</p>
<h3>雀斑與活力</h3>
<p>— 中繩</p>
<p>許多小姐在很小的時候，就會睜大着眼睛對了鏡子說：</p>
<p>「哦，多討厭呵，長滿了那麼些雀斑」！本文就是寫給有雀斑的小姐的。</p>
<p>女皇后妃，用朝露來塗抹她們的面部，舊法的美容家則配處硝石和甘油。咱們家母的時代却用玫瑰水混了硼砂，在酸牛奶中洗。</p>
<p>但是近代的科學家，却告訴我們，說雀斑是值得我們引以為榮，足以自傲的東西！愛爾蘭著名的婦科專家郭倫海博士說：「女子不該因為有雀斑而害臊，她得感到開心。雀斑是充滿活力的表現，也是一種性的引誘」。郭倫海博士對雀斑怎麼會知道得那末詳細呢？這兒有一個奇特的故事，郭氏的許多病人，碰巧有許多是長雀斑的，而大概有雀斑的女子所生底孩子總是特別壯健漂亮。他發現若是女子停止生育，那她也會停生雀斑。他又注意到：女子年紀愈大，她們的雀斑愈少。老太太總不會有雀斑的，雖然在年輕的時候也許她們的臉上是佈滿着雀斑。郭博士的結論，不過是研究雀斑的開端，到如今已經毫無疑問地可以證明。有雀斑的女子，要比臉蛋兒白如百合花的女子有活力得多！</p>
<p>近來我們常聽到一種從女性賀爾蒙中提出來的物質，可用以製造返老還童膏。在高貴的化粧品中，有時候也用到。這種性賀爾蒙，可以在雀斑的女子底身上，大量找到。</p>
<p>一般人常說紅頭女郎是最活潑的情人，但是現代科學却說使男人歡心的不是紅頭髪而是雀子斑。女子的頭髮無論銀色金色還是黑色，一反一般舊說，是無足輕重的。最有關係的倒是雀斑底有無。</p>
<p>有許多人雖有雀斑，你却不疑心她們有。有些人雖雀斑，但非肉眼能見到。在眼科學中，普通看不出的雀斑，一經紫外光綫或短波紫光照射之下，就原形畢露了。</p>
<p>喬漢克勞福在她成長期中，是個雀斑臉的小東西，茂娜特洛嫣也是有雀斑的。凱薩玲海波和珍尼麥唐納亦復如此。此外買賣和琪美史勺華也都是雀斑臉。羅斯福總統是有雀斑的，羅太太在女孩子時代還是滿臉雀斑。羅太太說這就是她為什麼變得難看了的原因之一。</p>
<p>還有一件奇怪的事：凡有雀斑的人，他們組織中的維他命C的供應，必定是非常豐富。美國政府科學家在碼麗蘭地方為設有試驗站，結果證明維他命C與性動力大有關係。他們所試驗的是雌牛和雄牛，但他們相信男人和女人也是一樣。（譯自禮拜六家庭周報）</p>

<h3>別被俘虜！</h3>
<p>— 黃澗</p>
<p>「給一個愛情的俘虜者」</p>
<p>XX：</p>
<p>我一口氣把你寄來的兩封信讀完，從這兩封不同的信中，我發現你們兩個是從兩個完全陌生的世界裏長大起來的，愛情的橋沒見得能把你們連接起來。一個是自命為「娜拉」式的人物，懷着孤高，倨傲，與自大，想在人生舞台上好好扮演一下，博得幾聲觀眾的喝彩；一個却是生下地的小犢，眼前看見的是一片碧綠，天真，樂觀，好奇，純潔，但是帶着一些幼稚氣。</p>
<p>我從這兩種不同的個性中，看不出協調的可能性，如果你不嫌我的話說得直率，最好早日把她的念頭丟開。</p>
<p>正如她所說的，我們學工程的人，應當富於理智。我們對於任何一件事，應該提得起，入得下，擺脫得開，我們平日常犯的一個毛病就是：一經心愛上的東西，不管是人或物，便覺得世界上沒有比這更好的了，這是由於我們見聞有限，眼光狹窄的緣故。你天天住在南山脚下，你天天看見的祇限於南山上的蟲木花鳥，你自然會覺得天下之美，盡在南山，假若你肯多跑幾個地方，多結納一些人緣，你就會禁不住自己嘲笑，你從前的趣味，顯得多麼低劣！你從前津津迷戀過的東西，拿現在的標準來衡量，離水準不知多遠，？莫洛亞說過一句話：「逃開給你痛苦的地方，你的痛苦就會慢慢醫好。」所以你想出來跑跑地方，我很贊成。一則眼不見，痛苦可以讓時間慢慢沖淡；二則也可以借此增加不少見聞。</p>
<p>人生有一些刺激原是好的。有了刺激，內在的潛能激發出來。人生也應該有一些事留着作不到，有一些東西高懸着得不來。這樣纔有希望的機會，努力的對象。假如件件事都順順利利的達到了，件件東西都稱心快意的獲得了，跟着得到的快感，便是「不過原來如此」的失望。只有奮鬥而後得到手東西，纔覺得愈嚼愈甜。我們愈是在失望沮喪的時候，愈要求期放達得開。年青的歌德，不是到處鍾情嗎？然而當他看見他的愛人像西天的太陽沉落時，他便掉回頭來欣賞東升的明月。我們應當學習歌德這樣的氣魄。推動的就讓他失去好了，何以哭喪着臉念念不忘舊情呢？</p>
<p>老實說，她摒棄你是因為看不起你終日嬉皮笑臉，沒有一點丈夫氣，她對你驕傲，不見得是毫無理由的，一個人能驕傲，敢驕傲，一定有幾分不平凡，你的來信上說：「她一天比一天活躍了，替報館寫社評，替各雜誌撰稿，我仍然無聲臭的摸我的機器。」你自甘無聲無臭，她當然看不上眼了。朋友，假如和她比較之下，你覺得自己相形見絀，也用不着長吁短嘆；從今天起你還來得及努力，太羨慕人家長進而自己不長進是無用的。只有以你自己的長進，來平衡人家的長進，你纔能操之在我，永遠是主人，而不是奴隸。人生最怕凡庸，遲滯，沒出息，你天天能製造「驚異」，旁人那敢小看你？只要你有作為，說不定你們還有和好的機會，萬一做不到，在你的努力過程中，你一定可以獲得不少新進度，偷嘗了許多奮鬥所生的樂趣。到頭來你的努力在旁的方面獲得超越的成就，胃口改了，眼光高了，創傷已經讓時間鋪平。你猛回頭來，看看遠落你後的她，於是你會稱心快意的說「瞧！我今天怎麼樣？」</p>
<p>朋友，我們要過強者的生活，不應該弱！弱是罪惡，是賊天之性，是給活着有用的人浪費糧食。在輕視我們的人面前，我們要拿出行動來。只要抓住現在好好幹，那麼每個明天，你會發現自己比昨天優秀。「讓它已死的過去，埋葬它已死的屍首。」從現在進起，趕快努力吧！</p>
<h3>釣魚的故事</h3>
<p>— 庭</p>
<p>倫敦出版的一本雜誌「旁觀者」（Spectator），登載一篇短短的小品文。四強共管德國的心理狀態，可以從一面的故事看出來：</p>
<p>「有一天，一個蘇聯人，一個法國人，一個美國人和一個英國人，正在參觀着一隻金魚缸。正在欣賞的興高烈采的時候，四條金魚突然從缸裏跳出來。蘇聯人見了，便立刻把其中的一條金魚一脚踏死了。那法國人便立刻蹲下去，抬起一條，放到袋裏，帶回家裏煮熟當晚餐。美國人則完全無動乎中，簡直不予理會。但是英國人呢，他把第四條金魚拾起來，很斯文地試去了塵埃，把它放回缸裏去，然後把缸裏的水從新換過。」</p>
<h3>溥儀之罪</h3>
<p>— 菲菲</p>
<p>偽滿傀儡兒皇帝溥儀，據報載引渡手續已經辦妥，本月二十日左右可海參威運抵上海，然後再由上海軍機解京，以重要戰犯身份受審。</p>
<p>溥儀在東北做了十四年的兒皇帝，十四年來他一直唯敵酋裕仁和關東軍的馬首是瞻，置東北人民於水深火熱之境。在奴化教育政策之下，二十幾歲左右的青年將不知有祖國，十歲左右的孩子却從來沒有看見過穀，在東北中國人吃大米是犯法的。</p>
<p>如果偶而偷吃而被發現，所受處罰比上海人吸食雅片還要嚴重；但日本人吃大米却不在此例，因為他們是征服者。中國人能夠不受侵略者干涉祇有一條，那便是販賣雅片和吸食雅片。</p>
<p>溥儀雖然是兒皇帝，雖然是天字第一號的大傀儡。例如在宮中祇能吸日本貨的香烟，英美貨的三五牌香烟，日本軍閥就禁止他吸。許多重要的工作他還是和日本軍閥同惡想濟，狼狽為奸的。</p>
<p>如果今天在東北發行一次民意測驗，問問東北人民對於處置溥儀的意見，東北全體人民可能要求政府用淩遲或殺頭的方式來處決溥儀；因為溥儀和日本軍閥過去就是用這種方法來對付東北的義勇軍。如果以其之道，還治其人之身。溥儀當然受之無愧。可惜中國現在已沒有了這一種刑罰。</p>
<p>兒皇帝的伏法終是遲早要實行的事僅先以此文為兒皇帝弔！</p>

<h3>寄給亡婦鳳君（三）</h3>
<p>— 周瘦鵑</p>
<p>有一天，在上海服務的小青兄的愛女育真小姐因事回蘇，和她母親上醫院來探望你；育真小姐是個虔誠的基督徒，就苦口婆心的勸你信仰基督，說惟有基督可以治你的病，救你的命。那時我還沒有到醫院，你不肯自作主張，說要得我的同意；唉！鳳，你也太迂執了！要是基督真能治你的病，救你的命，我有不同意的嗎？所以我一到醫院，聽得了這回事，就立時　　信信基督教，並旦許下願來，等我安葬好了那位畢生信佛的老母以後，也追隨你同作基督的信徒。好個育真小姐，忙着跪下來給你祈禱，直使我感動得甚麼似的。隨後我就時時借基督來鼓勵你持着信心，信基督定救護你的。可是半月以後，黃醫師却說注射空氣針並沒有多大成效，還是回家去好好休養吧；我聽了不免暗暗失望，而你却喜形於色，因為你一方面受不了注射的痛楚，一方面也為了戀家心切，以為醫院中沒有家中的舒服；我沒奈何，只得付清了賬，懷着一顆沉重的心，伴着你回家了。</p>
<p>回家以後，仍請吳醫師間日來給你注射那三種針藥，聽說美國派克但維司藥廠的混合維他命很有補益於病體，就寫快信給上海的錚兒，買了一百粒來，每天照服一二料。並且不斷的買了橘子奶粉和其他滋補的東西給你吃。我知道你一向是省吃儉用的，就苦苦勸你不要担心我經濟的來源，我手頭很是寬裕，要甚麼儘可買甚麼來。你想吃蜜棗，想吃葡萄幹，想吃榨菜，我走遍了觀前街，居然買到了，興沖沖地帶回來放到你手中，可是你只吃了兩個蜜棗，幾粒葡萄幹，就說太甜太膩，吃了一塊榨菜，又說太鹹太辣，都給擱下了。一日三餐，我在旁瞧着，總勸你多吃一些，你苦笑着未嘗不想多吃，無奈吃不下去，大概今生吃的比分快要滿了吧？我呵止你不許說這些不吉利的話，你也就住了口不再說了。可憐我千方百計，總想使你營養充足，用作抵抗病魔的武器；然而給你吃雞蛋，吃豆漿，吃牛肉汁，總是吃不多天，就不想再吃，就是其他你所愛吃的蝦腰鮑魚白雞醬鴨之類，也往往淺甞即止；你皺着眉說：「我的胃口不知被甚麼封鎖住了，為甚麼吃任何東西都不覺得有多大鮮味啊？」</p>
<p>你是一向愛好整潔的，在上海時雖出入廚下，還是衣履楚楚；如今雖在病中，仍要保持你整潔的故態，自已雖沒氣力，每天早上總得掙扎着起來，請葆妹給你統一條辨子，鋪一下牀，整理一下被褥，趁這機會，我就扶着你到廊下去，在藤　椅上靠坐道麼半小時，吸收一些清新的空氣，間接的曬一些陽光。你有興時，還得扶你去看看那欣向榮的花木，你也願而樂之。</p>
<p>農曆三月十日，是你五十歲的壽辰，我和兒女們都很看重這一天，預備替你慶祝一番，並且都希望過了這一天，你的身體會一天天硬朗起來。前一天，錚兒果然偕同你的四個妹妹玲，梅，杏，瑛，表弟兆熙，還有梅的兒子心泰，杏的夫婿俊卿兒子平生，一行九人，浩浩蕩蕩的從上海趕回來了，只有媳婦玉帶身懷六甲，快將臨盆，梅的夫婿鏡人又為診務所牽，因此都不會趕來；你眼瞧着這一　兒女至至誠誠的回來向你祝壽，紛紛的獻上禮物，穿的吃的，整堆的堆在你牀上，直使你高興得流下眼淚來。第二天早上，我們全體動員，佈置禮堂，當中掛發外工筆花草畫成的大壽字幅，供着壽字的銅燭臺，銅香爐，和一座可插七枝蠟燭的新型燭臺，園丁獻了斤通大紅燭和壽字香，便連同七枝紅蠟燭一齊都點了起來，桌子的中央，供了景海女師許秀珍女士所贈的壽麵和媳婦託錚兒代獻的壽字蛋糕，兩面的長供桌上，都供着古銅器，居然也很像一個禮堂的模樣兒了。我為了表示隆重起見，前幾天已託蘇友代定了一桌魚翅席；到了正午時分，合家團坐在圓桌子上並請許女士來參加，真是喜氣洋溢；你坐在正中，眉宇間也透着十分愉快的神情。這一席菜肴很為豐盛，你雖不能多吃，我却偏要你每樣都嘗試一些，並且把家釀的玫瑰花酒觴上臺，你也勉強的沾一沾唇；大家瞧了，教興奮得甚麼似的。你不願意掃我們的興，直至席散之後，方始上牀去休息。午後照例吃麵吃蛋糕，你也吃了一些，這一個壽辰，雖不會驚動朋友，而總算做足了「家慶」兩個字；不過你因自己有病，一概不許拜壽，這是使兒女們都覺得歉然於心的。</p>
<h3>宵禁與戒嚴</h3>
<p>— 洪因</p>
<p>宵禁取消後，當局宣稱戒嚴並不取消。許多人弄得莫明其妙，他們說兩者有何分別？</p>
<p>其實很簡單：宵禁專指夜間禁止通行，（在上海，是午夜十二時後開始。）它是戒嚴的方式之一。至於戒嚴令，則視事實之需要隨時可以宣佈，因不限於夜間耳。</p>
<p>弄明白了嗎？</p>

<h3>Special Plane Brings Back the Hankou Three-Person Group; Marshall Emphasizes the Central Plains War; Chen, Zhou, and Other Five Hold Talks Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Government representatives Chen Cheng, Wang Shijie, and Shao Lizi, along with CCP representatives Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu, met again this afternoon at Shao Lizi's residence in Langya, adjourning at 7:00 PM. It is said that the content of the talks still concerned the issue of administrative power in the recovered areas. Despite repeated inquiries from reporters, neither side revealed a single word of their opinions.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] (Reference News) According to relevant sources, Marshal Marshall is considering returning to his country to report on his duties and is expected to discuss China policy with President Truman after his return. However, it is rumored that Marshal Marshall will return to China again after his trip. It is also rumored that the soon-to-be-replaced American Ambassador to China, John Leighton Stuart, may be the second person in Marshal Marshall's position.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The CCP delegation originally planned to host reporters at 4:00 PM today to report on the Central Plains war situation. However, due to insufficient preparation, it has been changed to 4:00 PM tomorrow at the Meiyuan New Village office. At that time, Major General Zheng Shaowen, the CCP representative from the 9th group stationed in Hankou, will attend the report.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] In order to understand the situation of the Central Plains war, Special Envoy Marshall specifically telegraphed Colonel He Zhujian, the American representative of the 9th Executive Group stationed in Hankou under the Military Mediation Department; Major Lu Jishi, the government representative; Major General Zheng Shaowen, the CCP representative; Lieutenant Colonel Bai Luosuo, the American representative of the 32nd Executive Group stationed in Xuanbei Huadian; Lieutenant Colonel Li Guiliu, the government representative; and Ren Shishun, the CCP representative, to come to Nanjing to hear reports from the three parties' representatives before proceeding with mediation. The representatives of the three parties arrived in Nanjing on a special plane chartered by Marshall at 3:25 PM yesterday. He Zhujian and Bai Luosuo have already met with Marshall and reported in detail the movements of Li Xiannian's unit of the CCP's Central Plains Military Region westward along the Pinghan Railway and the clashes with the National Army along the way. It is reported that after listening to the reports from the American representatives, Marshall intends to inquire about the opinions of the government and the CCP on the Central Plains war before deciding on a plan and starting mediation.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] Special Envoy Marshall shifted his focus in peace negotiations today to putting out the growing flames of war, recalling the 9th Executive Group from the critical northern Hubei region to hear emergency reports.</p>
<h3>Dr. John Leighton Stuart Appointed Ambassador to China; Truman Officially Announces; Overwhelming Welcome from Our Government and Public</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] US President Truman announced in Washington on the 9th that he had appointed John Leighton Stuart as the US Ambassador to China and that it would not affect Special Envoy Marshall's work in China. After this news reached the capital, Special Envoy Marshall issued a statement this afternoon, expressing his welcome. He stated: "The newly appointed US Ambassador to China, John Leighton Stuart, is a non-official American who has lived in China for the longest time. He not only deeply understands the national conditions of China but is also a good friend to all parties in the Chinese government and public. His appointment as US Ambassador to China is a good assistant to me." Marshall's statement shows that he will continue to stay in China as President Truman's special envoy and work for China's peace and unity.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] President Truman today recommended and appointed John Leighton Stuart, President of Yenching University, as the US Ambassador to China, to fill the vacancy left by former Ambassador Hurley. According to a statement issued by the White House, John Leighton Stuart has known President Chiang Kai-shek and his wife and other government officials for many years. John Leighton Stuart has previously argued that an understanding between the United States and the Soviet Union on their China policy is a prerequisite for resolving many disputes in China.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] President Truman announced today that John Leighton Stuart's appointment as Ambassador to China will not affect the status of Special Envoy Marshall.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that the United States has appointed John Leighton Stuart, President of Yenching University, as Ambassador to China without seeking the approval of the Ministry. However, if this appointment is officially confirmed, the Chinese government will certainly welcome it.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Kai welcomed John Leighton Stuart's appointment as US Ambassador to China at a press conference, praising John Leighton Stuart as "a good friend of China."</p>
<p>Dr. Stuart's Talk</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 10th] The newly appointed US Ambassador to China, John Leighton Stuart, made a statement to the United Press reporter here today, saying, "I deeply feel the difficult situation, but I will do my best in any way to assist Special Envoy Marshall in completing his mission of promoting peace. I enthusiastically agree with Marshall's policy." This appointment will give me new experience. It is John Leighton Stuart's first time as a diplomat as a scholar. I knew something about it beforehand, but I only learned about the appointment a few hours ago. Now I have to temporarily ask for leave from Yenching University. Educational work has to be temporarily interrupted, which is a pity. Once the arrangements are in place, I will go to Nanjing to assume my new post in a few days. There is no time to look for a successor as President of Yenching University.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] The United States' sudden appointment of educator and missionary John Leighton Stuart is seen as President Truman having found a figure welcomed by all parties in China.

<h3>Hu Shih Denies Forming a Party</h3>

<h3>The CCP's "July 7th" Declaration is Purely a Propaganda Smoke Screen; Minister Peng Analyzes and Refutes it in Detail</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] A foreign press conference was held at 4:30 PM on the 10th, presided over by Minister Peng Xuepei and Vice Minister Liu Zeng. The main questions and answers are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Question) What is the government's attitude towards the four new proposals put forward by the CCP on the anniversary of the July 7th Incident, and what is the government's attitude towards the CCP's anti-American propaganda?</p>
<p>(Minister Peng's Answer) The CCP's July 7th Declaration is a propaganda smoke screen, not a genuine proposal. It has ulterior motives other than seeking a path to peace. The first two points are not new issues: stopping the conflict, insisting on reorganizing the army, and determining the garrison locations. Reopening the Political Consultative Conference requires the CCP to reiterate the original resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. The remaining two points happen to reveal the mystery of the so-called anti-American movement. This anti-American propaganda is due to the needs of the CCP's domestic political interests and is completely contrary to the wishes of the government and the people. As for the so-called refusal of American aid and denial of American loans, it is not worth discussing seriously.</p>
<p>Current Military Situation (Question) Minister Peng stated on June 30th that if the Communist army attacks the National army, it should be resisted or driven away. Will such actions occur in the future, and what are the cities currently under attack by the Communist army?</p>
<p>(Minister Peng's Answer) The current military situation can be summarized as follows: (A) The Communist army is concentrating heavy troops to besiege Haimen, Liuhe, and other places, and seems to be launching a fierce attack. The government is paying close attention to this matter. (B) The Communist army is fiercely attacking Qingxian, south of Tianjin. (C) The Communist army continues to besiege Datong. (D) Li Xiannian's unit of the Communist army violated the agreement and, from its original garrison in northern Hubei, broke through westward and is now approaching Xiangyang. The following are the detailed situations: Since July 1st, the Communist army has not only not stopped its attacks on western Shandong and the Northeast, but has also continued large-scale attacks on Hubei, Henan, and northern Jiangsu. Within Shandong, Yancheng, outside Dawen, on the Jinpu Railway, was continuously attacked from the 1st to the 3rd. Baisha and Huangbu water source, north of Qingdao, were attacked on the 2nd. Jin Cen Town, Zihe Store, Linzi, Weixian, Qingzhou, and areas near Jimo along the Jiaoji Railway have all been subjected to constant attacks. Now it is also increasing troops near Jingzhou, and there are also 40,000 to 50,000 troops gathered in the area west of Zichuan and Boshan, and it seems that there is new action again. Ningwu in Shanxi Province was captured on the 1st, and Fanshi was captured on the 4th, and 100,000 troops besieged Datong. And increasing troops in Wenxi, Houma, and the area east of Jiwang Mountain, preparing to attack Jishan. Luochu in eastern Hubei, Zaoyang and Nanzhang in northern Hubei, Dengxian in southern Henan, Han in Anhui Province, Tangyin, Wuzhi, and Wenxian in northern Henan are still under attack. Macheng in eastern Hubei has been captured, and the situation in Yicheng in northern Hubei has become unclear. Three divisions in northern Jiangsu are advancing fiercely towards Liuhe and Lai'an. 20,000 people are gathered between Meng, Pei, Yang, and Yong counties, and the pseudo-army Hao Ju unit, which has been increased to the vicinity of Donghai by the Communist army, is pressing towards Yangshan and Tonghai in two routes. Qingxian, Cangxian, and Machang in Hebei have been under attack since the 6th. The Pinghan, Jinpu, Jiaoji, Tongpu, and Zhengtai railways have all been continuously destroyed. Since the 1st, the areas attacked in the Northeast include Fulongquan west of Huai'de, Erdaogou, Linchang, and the north bank of the Songhua River south of Yingri. On the 4th, the Communist army also shelled the south bank of the Songhua River. The Mongolian Yingzi and Que District north of Beipiao in Rehe Province were also attacked by the Communist army on the 1st.</p>
<p>Communist Army Occupied Areas (Question) Regarding the strength of the Communist army, can you please show us in detail how many troops the Communist army had during and after the war, and how many areas the Communist army occupied during and after the war?</p>
<p>(Minister Peng's Answer) The Communist army issued a declaration on September 22nd of the 26th year of the Republic, voluntarily canceling the Red Army designation. At that time, there were only 45,000 people, and they followed the government's orders and were reorganized into three divisions. The government then approved the establishment of the New Fourth Army under five detachments. On July 16th of the 29th year of the Republic, the Central Government again proposed that in addition to being organized into three armies, six divisions, and three supplementary regiments, the Eighteenth Group Army should also add two supplementary regiments, and the New Fourth Army should have two divisions, and no detachments should be established. Afterwards, the New Fourth Army violated military discipline and was expressly abolished by the Central Government on January 17th of the 30th year of the Republic. In the 33rd year of the Republic, the Communist army requested to be reorganized into sixteen divisions, but the government only allowed it to be reorganized into eight to ten divisions. Last year, when the Communist army negotiated with the government, the Communist side again requested to be reorganized into sixteen armies and forty-eight divisions, sixteen times more than at the beginning of the occupation. At that time, the government reluctantly responded to the Communist side's request and allowed it to be reorganized into 20 divisions, but the Communist army did not comply with the order to reorganize. Before the military reorganization agreement, there were a total of one general headquarters, one army headquarters, and twelve division headquarters. As of June of this year, according to investigations, it has been expanded to two general headquarters (one in the Northeast), fourteen army headquarters (five in the Northeast), forty-three division headquarters (nine in the Northeast), fifty-five military districts, eighty-one independent brigades (thirteen in the Northeast), and sixty-three independent regiments (details of the Northeast and local teams are unknown). In addition, the Communist army in the Northeast has the "Democratic Allied Army," and in North China, there are the "Ji Re Liao Pu Sui," "Jin Ji," "Lu Yu," "Jin Cha Ji," "Shandong," "Shaan Gan Ning," "Central China," and "Central Plains" eight field military regions, and the "Democratic Founding Army," "Democratic Second Allied Army," etc. Its total strength (including local teams and militia) is estimated to be over 800,000. As for the area occupied by the Communist army, before the Japanese surrender, it was 74 counties. From the Japanese surrender to January 13th of this year, another 241 counties were occupied. After the order to stop the conflict on January 13th, another 22 counties were occupied, for a total of 337 counties.</p>

<h3>A Brief Biography of Dr. John Leighton Stuart</h3>
<p>Dr. John Leighton Stuart was born in Hangzhou, China in 1876. His father, Stuart, was a devout Christian who came to China to preach very early, so Dr. Stuart lived a Chinese life in his childhood, traveling with his parents to various parts of China, learning Chinese language and writing. His family was a composite of schools, hospitals, and society, isolated in an alien cultural environment, which had a very important influence on him. At the age of eleven, he was sent back to the United States to study. In 1892, he entered Hampton-Sydney College, where his greatest interest was Greek and Latin. At this time, he had a desire to become a university professor. In 1896, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree, and in 1899, he entered the Union Theological Seminary. However, he felt that preaching work was meaningless. In 1902, after graduating from the seminary, he stayed in the Southern Church for two years, raising funds for the church, which was a remarkable achievement. During the trip, he met Miss Luo Anlin and admired her very much. Before coming to China in 1940, he married Miss Luo Anlin. In 1930, the University of Bezeston awarded him an honorary doctorate.</p>
<p>After returning to Hangzhou in 1904, Dr. Stuart helped his father to do missionary work for three years. At this time, he began to study ancient Chinese characters. In 1908, he was hired as a teacher at Nanjing Theological Seminary. From then on, he spent eleven years of school life in Nanjing. He was very satisfied with this quiet environment. At this time, he published many Chinese works. From 1918, Beiping Huiwen College and Linhe College in Tongxian, Hebei were merged into Yenching University, and Dr. Stuart was hired as the president of Yenching University. He did not resign from the hard work and resolutely took on the work of founding the school, until now. Yenching University has used his thirty years of efforts to create and manage, to reach today's position, and it can be comforting that there are many students all over the world.</p>
<p>After the Lugouqiao Incident in the 26th year of the Republic of China, the environment in Beiping deteriorated day by day. Dr. Stuart continued his career with an indomitable spirit. He was obstructed by the Japanese several times, but he still remained calm. During the Anti-Japanese War, he went to Chongqing three times to discuss school matters, in order to maintain contact with the Chinese authorities. Until the outbreak of the Pacific War in the 30th year of the Republic of China, Japan was very hostile to Britain and the United States, and Yenching University was forced to suspend classes, and Dr. Stuart was also detained by the Japanese for three years and eight months. During the time that Dr. Stuart was detained, the Japanese side proposed ceasefire conditions and wanted him to take them to Chongqing. Dr. Stuart flatly refused. His loyalty to China can be seen from this. He was only released after Japan surrendered in the 34th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Dr. Stuart was born in China, and his life's work is also in China. China is his second hometown, and he has long considered himself to be Chinese.</p>

It is reported that the President's official residence in Lushan was occupied by Germans during the period of the Japanese occupation. Later, after the establishment of the German-Japanese Axis, it was moved in by French priests, so the house was not greatly damaged, but many of the internal furniture were moved away. After sending personnel to take care of it, it has now been completely renovated and furnished and is guarded by military police and attendants. In addition, the sedan chair taken by the President and his wife to the mountains has been slightly damaged due to its long disuse, and it has also been equipped and completed. The style is quite beautiful. The sedan body is slightly similar to a rickshaw, and the sedan awning is made of rainproof material. The President has three cars and many jeeps, all of which have been transported to Jiujiang. Marshall's residence is quite close to the President's official residence, about ten houses apart.

<h3>Dai Buer Men's Flight to Changchun Postponed; Dulin Meeting Expected to be Delayed; Shenyang Authorities Prepare to Take Over Qiqihar</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, 10th of this Month] The meeting between Dulin and Lin in Changchun, originally scheduled for the 16th, has to be postponed due to Lin's uncertain travel plans to Changchun. It is now learned that the Communist side must wait for Rao Shushi to go to Beijing to meet with Zhou Enlai for consultations. After returning to Harbin, he will meet with Lin to discuss the matter before a definite date can be set. The rumor that it would be postponed to the 14th is merely speculation.

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th of this Month] The Capital Outlying Reporters Association, whose four members were beaten while covering news in Xiaguan, had requested a subsidy from the Central Propaganda Department. This request has been approved and disbursed on the 9th. This sum is a loss subsidy requested by the association from the Central Propaganda Department. The United Press's Nanjing dispatch on the 9th referring to it as "compensation" is completely inconsistent with the facts. Furthermore, the dispatch mistakenly identified Gao Ji as a reporter from the Dagang News, and the reported figures for the allocation of the subsidy are also incorrect.</p>

<h3>Train Derailment Occurs Between Zhoujingxiang and Wuxi; Driver and Over 30 Passengers Injured</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Wuxi, 10th of this Month] The Second Triumph Special Express train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, heading from Shanghai to Beijing, derailed at Zhouxiang Station at around 10 a.m. on the 10th due to sabotage of the tracks. The locomotive and four passenger cars suddenly derailed, injuring over thirty passengers and damaging twenty-nine sections of the line, and over a hundred wooden sleepers. Fortunately, there were no deaths. Traffic has been disrupted, and active handling is currently underway.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Suzhou, 10th of this Month] The First Triumph Special Express train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, which departed from Shanghai at 7 a.m. on the 10th, derailed at approximately 10 a.m. between Zhoujingxiang and the South Gate of Wuxi in the Suma section, at the 10th telegraph pole of the 120th kilometer. The driver suddenly felt the train shake and immediately braked. Locomotive MCMA713 derailed and continued forward, crashing and overturning on the side of the road. The first baggage car behind the locomotive also derailed and overturned. The two second-class cars and two first-class cars behind the baggage car all derailed. The dining car only had its front four wheels derailed and did not overturn. In addition to the seriously injured driver, Li Jinshan, more than thirty passengers suffered minor injuries and have been sent to the Wuxi Railway Hospital for treatment. The overturned carriages struck the telegraph poles, causing a simultaneous disruption of communications. Wu Minglu, a track inspector, reported the situation to the stationmaster of Zhoujingxiang Station, who telegraphed for assistance. Rescue trains were dispatched from both Shanghai and Changzhou stations at 11 a.m. Simultaneously, a gasoline car was dispatched from the North Shanghai Station to the accident site to transport some of the Triumph Express passengers back. Deputy Director Hou of the Railway Bureau, Director Mei of the Engineering Department, Deputy Director Zhang, Wan Jiu, Section Chief Feng of the Engineering Section, Section Chief Ouyang of the Transportation Section, Section Chief Li of the Mechanical Section, and doctors and nurses traveled by gasoline car to supervise the rescue efforts. When the reporter arrived, the locomotive was deeply embedded in the mud, and one telegraph pole lay toppled beside the track with telegraph wires crisscrossing. The damaged sleepers were already being repaired. The passengers had all walked to the South Gate of Wuxi to take other trains. According to the Railway Bureau, all the damage will be repaired by dawn this morning so that passenger trains can run as usual today. An investigation revealed that the derailment was a premeditated conspiracy by the Communists with the aim of disrupting traffic.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 10th of this Month] After the derailment of the Second Triumph Express train on the Beijing-Shanghai Line, the main station immediately telegraphed Changzhou and Wuxi stations to dispatch rescue trains to the accident site to transfer the passengers to Wuxi Station, who were then transported to Beijing on Train No. 6 (originally from Beijing to Shanghai, but turned back to Wuxi after the accident). All passengers arrived safely in Beijing at 10 p.m.</p>
<h3>Track Repairs to be Completed Soon; Traffic to Resume This Morning</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Regarding the derailment of some carriages of the Second Special Express train "Triumph", which departed from North Shanghai Station at 7 a.m. yesterday and occurred between Zhoujingxiang and the South Gate of Wuxi (approximately 120 kilometers from Shanghai) at 9:30 a.m., the results of the investigation showed that locomotive MCMA713 and baggage and mail car BMG882 were overturned.

<p>It is reported that this derailment incident was a planned action by the Communist Party with political implications. The Railway Bureau regularly sends personnel to strictly inspect the railway situation, so it is definitely not a technical oversight.</p>
<h3>Xi'an Reporters' Delegation Arrives in Shanghai This Morning</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Xi'an Reporters' Delegation, after arriving in Beijing, made a detour to Shanghai for sightseeing. When they took the special express train from Beijing to Shanghai at 9 a.m. yesterday morning, they encountered the derailment of some carriages of the Triumph Express train, which departed from North Station at 7 a.m. and occurred between Zhoujingxiang and the South Gate of Wuxi.

<h3>UNRRA Industrial Equipment; Shipments to China Suspended Immediately; Essential Foodstuffs Not Included</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Washington, New Haven Office, 9th of this Month] UNRRA Director LaGuardia announced today that shipments of all UNRRA industrial and agricultural equipment to China are suspended, effective immediately. LaGuardia stated that the distribution of UNRRA supplies in mainland China is not considered satisfactory. All Chinese ports must clear UNRRA supplies so that these goods can be distributed to those in need in a manner deemed satisfactory by UNRRA personnel. LaGuardia stated that he anticipated congestion in Chinese ports and would address it. He notified Chairman Chiang on June 6 that he would take action if the ports were not cleared. A plan to clear the ports has been drafted and will be implemented this month, resulting in the suspension of shipments of industrial and agricultural equipment to China, but goods already loaded onto ships are not included. LaGuardia's announcement also stated that essential foodstuffs such as wheat, rice, grains, and milk will continue to be shipped to China, but only on the condition that the Chinese government quickly clears the ports and that UNRRA transports relief supplies to mainland China and distributes them in a satisfactory manner.</p>
<h3>UNRRA's Actions Were Expected; Jiang Ting's Response</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] After UNRRA Director LaGuardia announced that relief supplies would be suspended to our country starting yesterday, the reporter specifically went to the "Executive Headquarters" to inquire. A spokesperson for the Executive Headquarters stated that the agency had not yet received official notification. In fact, it was due to unavoidable circumstances. As for the so-called uneven distribution, it seems that the main point is that the Communist areas received less. However, the main reason is also due to inconvenient transportation. The extreme lack of supplies in areas controlled by the Communist Party is indeed a fact, but the Executive Headquarters has also tried its best to transport relief supplies to Communist areas such as Linyi, northern Henan, and Lishan in Hubei. Furthermore, Director Jiang also agreed with Mr. Zhou Enlai on four points: (1) All those in the Communist areas affected by war, regardless of race, religion, or political belief, will receive relief; (2) The Executive Headquarters will never interfere in local administration; (3) The Communist Party can send representatives to participate in the relief work in the "Communist area"; (4) If relief workers or vehicles are detained, the Executive Headquarters will withdraw. All work is being carried out in accordance with this principle. It is generally speculated that LaGuardia's current ban on the shipment of supplies to China is temporary in nature.</p>
<h3>Executive Headquarters Establishes Office in Yantai</h3>
<p>[Another Report] The Executive Headquarters announced that it will soon establish an office directly under the headquarters in Yantai, with Wang Shiliang, a non-partisan overseas Chinese from Washington, as the director. Mr. Wang has already led more than ten staff members and Mr. Hedener of UNRRA to set off and prepare everything. There is also an LST vessel carrying 2,000 tons of supplies heading to Yantai. However, because the office is directly under the headquarters, it is currently being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is said that this is the first office established by the Executive Headquarters in a Communist area.</p>
<h3>Executive Headquarters' Deputy Director Responds to Accusations of Selling Food, Citing Difficulties</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 10th of this Month] After UNRRA staff sent a joint telegram to Director LaGuardia accusing the Chinese government of misusing UNRRA supplies, a Communist Party spokesperson stated that these accusations were all true. According to Communist figures, only 5/1000 of UNRRA supplies were transported to Communist-controlled areas. According to the Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the government has not provided the Executive Headquarters with adequate funding, forcing it to sell food needed by countless starving people. This is a fact, but the government should not be criticized for this. The Executive Headquarters is allowed to sell part of UNRRA supplies to make up for the funding shortfall. However, the Executive Headquarters is now facing new difficulties. For example, flour and other items can no longer be sold because there are too many starving people, and labor costs have risen several times. The unloading expenses for one ship of supplies amount to 100 million Legal Tender, not including warehouse storage fees. A total of 170 to 180 ships have been unloaded, so the Executive Headquarters' expenditure in this area is already considerable. Although the Executive Headquarters' funding is not provided by the government, the government has allocated 432,000,000,000,000 yuan in the budget for this year's rehabilitation and relief expenses, of which approximately 380,000,000,000,000 yuan is allocated to transportation, such as the repair of railways, highways, and waterways. Regarding the second point of criticism from UNRRA staff, it is not accurate. They said that the Chinese government violated the agreement by prohibiting the transport of UNRRA supplies to Communist areas, which only accounted for 2% of the total. So far, items such as trains, rails, timber, and some medicines must be handed over to government agencies. Therefore, the so-called percentage obtained by a certain area must only be calculated based on items directly supplied to the people. Trains, rails, etc., should be removed from the total. Transportation disruption is the biggest difficulty in distributing relief supplies, but the Executive Headquarters is still trying its best to transport them, and some UNRRA supplies have also been obtained in the Northeast. Chairman Chiang also consistently advocates for fairness in the distribution of relief supplies.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves One-Year Exemption of Business Tax for the Grain Industry</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th of this Month] After the victory, the Ministry of Finance stipulated a one-year exemption from business tax for the grain industry to help stabilize grain prices. Initially, it was limited to rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains, excluding items that had been processed. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance has expanded the scope to include flour, corn flour, sorghum flour, and flour made from beans and miscellaneous grains, regardless of whether they are manufactured or sold. The tax exemption will be granted from October of last year for one year, and the taxes that have already been paid will be refunded upon presentation of a certificate to the local direct branch bureaus, which are complying with the order.</p>
<h3>Disastrous Conditions in Central and Southern Hubei</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hankou, 10th of this Month] The grain and disaster situation in the areas of Hubei Province are severe. Along the Hankou-Yichang-Xiangyang-Shashi highways, wasteland is everywhere, and beggars fill the roads. Jingmen has suffered more than Yichang, but no one has reported it, so outsiders are unaware.</p>
<h3>Successful Test Run of the Pinghan Railway Express Train Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hankou, 10th of this Month] The Pinghan Railway express train successfully completed its test run from Hankou to Xiaogan yesterday. It is scheduled to officially begin operations on the 16th, and it will be possible to reach Zhengzhou from Hankou on the same day. The authorities have adopted the expert opinion and decided to locate the site of the Central China Steel Plant in Shihuiyao, Hubei Province, and have appointed Cheng Zhongshi and Liu Jian to oversee the preparations.</p>
<h3>Active Efforts to Plug Breaches in Hankou City</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 9th of this Month] The Hankou City Flood Prevention Committee is actively plugging breaches surrounding Hankou City. Currently, half of the entire project has been completed. The dike at Yijiadun is extremely dangerous, and the committee has sent technicians with flood prevention equipment to rush repairs. Although the Wuhui Dike in Wuchang County is being repaired, there is no stone or earth nearby, and transportation is extremely difficult due to limited conditions. The river water has been overflowing in recent days, and the danger is greater than before, which is extremely concerning.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Instructs the Executive Yuan to Assist UNRRA to the Best of Its Ability; Orders All National Agencies to Comply Strictly</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th of this Month] Chairman Chiang is extremely concerned about the work of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. This month, he specially instructed the Executive Yuan to order all national military and political agencies to assist to the best of their ability. The original order stated: The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration was jointly established by our country and the Allied nations in November of the year before last. Its main task is to provide residents of recovered areas in this war with food, clothing, and shelter, as well as to provide assistance and relief to prevent epidemics and restore health, and to engage in the rehabilitation of agricultural and industrial production and public utilities. All distribution and disbursement of rehabilitation and relief supplies will not discriminate against disaster victims based on race, religion, or political affiliation. UNRRA is now successively providing material assistance to our country and sending experts to assist the government. The Executive Yuan has specially established the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to oversee national relief and rehabilitation matters, which is a major task after the war. However, this matter is extensive and complex, and all relevant agencies should do their best to assist in order to achieve results as soon as possible, especially military agencies and troops, which should assist at any time and any place. Regarding transportation, priority should be given to the transportation of relief and rehabilitation supplies and personnel, and no delays or obstruction of passage should be allowed. In addition, existing hospitals and housing in various places that are currently used for military purposes should be vacated immediately so that the medical supplies provided by UNRRA can be fully utilized through this existing architecture. Furthermore, military vehicles from various units that can be used to transport relief supplies should also be temporarily lent as much as possible, and efforts should be made to work together, act righteously, and be courageous so that disaster relief can be timely and the wounds of the people can be healed as soon as possible, which is deeply hoped.</p>
<h3>Repeating the Old Trick of the Traitor Chu Minyi; Traitor Mei Siping Seeks Retrial; The Capital High Court Tried Traitor Chen Junhui Yesterday; The Eldest Son of Traitor Wang Was Indicted, The Second Son Was Released</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th of this Month] The date of execution of traitor Mei Siping is being closely watched by all parties. However, according to news from the Capital High Court on the 10th, traitor Mei actually repeated the old trick of traitor Chu Minyi, submitting a petition to the court for a retrial. The reasons cited were: (1) He maintained security and order in the Beijing Railway; (2) He assisted in the central government's takeover work; (3) He maintained public utilities; (4) He assisted in the war of resistance; (5) He was beneficial to the people. It is reported that the High Court will review the case to decide whether to accept it.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 10th of this Month] Pseudo-Industry Minister, traitor Chen Junhui, was tried at the Capital High Court this morning at 10 a.m. According to traitor Chen, he was most opposed to the organization of the pseudo-government at the time, but because of his deep relationship with traitor Wang, he could not bear to leave. He defended himself with fifteen points, recounting his excuses for serving in the pseudo-government, such as repairing water conservancy, manufacturing agricultural implements, protecting industry, and sheltering underground workers. The court stated that his statements were all empty words with no basis and announced that the case would be retried after collecting evidence.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th of this Month] Wang Zhaoming's eldest son (Mengjin), who was previously arrested by the Capital High Court on charges of treason, was formally indicted on the 10th. Wang's second son, Wendi, was sentenced to one year and six months imprisonment with a five-year suspended sentence by the Capital High Court on June 26 for treason. Since neither the defendant nor the prosecutor requested a review of the case during this period, the court officially released him today and ordered the Northern District Police Bureau to be responsible for his protection.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 10th of this Month] Cultural traitor Luo Qingshan was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment, deprived of public rights for 10 years, and all property confiscated by the Hebei High Court Criminal Division this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Welcoming Ambassador Stuart</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday, U.S. President Truman appointed Dr. Stuart as the U.S. Ambassador to China. This is such delightful good news for us! Especially at this time of precarious and unsettling situation in the Far East, the dispatch of Dr. Stuart, who has always advocated that the U.S. and Soviet Union should reach an understanding on their policies towards China, to China as ambassador will certainly contribute to the peace in the Far East. Our welcome to this new ambassador goes without saying.</p>
<p>The relationship between China and the United States has always been known for its cordiality. After being tempered by eight years of war, it has become even more solid and has become a friendship forged in adversity. The United States initially extended sympathy to our resistance against Japan in spirit, and then provided as much assistance as possible in terms of material. The Chinese people are indeed deeply grateful, and what is especially rare is that the United States has often acted as China's honest friend, offering faithful advice and good guidance, enabling China to move forward on the road to democracy after the war, and not hesitating to help China become a strong, unified, and democratic nation at any cost. Since President Truman announced his China policy in December of last year, he has been moving towards this goal without change. Although the change of the U.S. Ambassador to China is a common event in diplomacy, with international relations becoming increasingly close, mutual assistance and trust between countries rely on mutual understanding. Dr. Stuart can be said to be the first person in the United States to have the clearest understanding of China. This time, he has been ordered to visit China, which will not only enhance the friendship between China and the United States, but also further have a positive impact on the entire Far East situation.</p>
<p>Dr. Stuart was born in Hangzhou, China. For fifty of his seventy years, he lived in China. It is not an exaggeration to say that China is his second hometown. He not only understands our country's national conditions and the characteristics of our nation, but also has a deep understanding of our country's political situation and the opinions of our people. Moreover, because he has lived in China for a long time, he is well-versed in Chinese language and writing, and his words, actions, and thoughts can interact well with Chinese people. His contribution to China includes his dedication to education, serving as the president of Yenching University for thirty years, with students all over the world. What is most admirable about him throughout his life is that after the outbreak of the Pacific War, he was detained in a concentration camp by the Japanese army, but his noble integrity made the Japanese have to respect him. Although they tried every means to coerce and tempt him, asking him to carry the Japanese conditions for peace with China to Chongqing, he resolutely refused with righteousness and dignity, preferring to go hungry and suffer rather than running errands for the Japanese invaders. This spirit is forever worthy of our gratitude. On the day of his seventieth birthday this year, our government specially issued a decree praising him, which is a glorious page in the history of Sino-U.S. cultural exchange.</p>
<p>President Truman's appointment of such a "friend of China" as ambassador to China also shows his emphasis on the China issue. In recent weeks, because the Communist Party has based its arguments on anti-American arguments in Moscow newspapers, it has tried to incite anti-American sentiment among the Chinese people in various ways, and even at the cost of spreading rumors that are unfavorable to China among American friends, creating estrangement between China and the United States, such as the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) temporarily suspending the shipment of relief supplies to China, etc., and then using these facts as an opportunity to provoke the Chinese people's anti-American sentiment. China and the United States were originally like-minded friends in adversity, but the CCP has been sowing discord from within. Therefore, the relationship between China and the United States seems to be encountering a test. Whether in the United States or in China, at this time, the layer of thin clouds in front of us should be swept away. This newspaper, which has a history of more than seventy years, is willing to represent the opinions of the general public of China as a reporter, believing that the more conspiracies there are to undermine the relationship between China and the United States, the more necessary it is for China and the United States to be frank and sincere with each other. Therefore, Dr. Stuart's mission at this time is not only to strengthen the cooperation between the two governments, but especially to promote close cooperation between the peoples of the two countries.</p>
<p>Dr. Stuart is naturally endowed with dual qualifications: on the one hand, he is a legal citizen of New York, USA; on the other hand, he was born in Hangzhou, China, and China is his second hometown. The U.S. president dispatched such a person to China as ambassador, which is already more appropriate than others in promoting mutual understanding between the people of China and the United States, and moreover, he is an educator. Employing an educator as a diplomat can better accomplish this mission. Therefore, we also believe that if international cooperation is truly desired, if world peace is truly desired, the re-education of the world seems to be a factor that cannot be ignored. In recent years, the world has seen a general decline in morality and the near extinction of human nature due to the war. Human wisdom seems to be entirely used for lethal weapons, and human civilization is in danger of complete destruction. If we want human survival and world peace, we must awaken the deluded humanity. Dr. Stuart has been engaged in education in China for decades. After the fall of Peiping and Tianjin, even in the midst of hardship and difficulty, he still used the name of the "American Education Association" to preside over the affairs of Yenching University, assisting the young people who were resisting the war behind enemy lines, and he is truly worthy of being a great educator of our time. This time, he will be appointed as ambassador, and he will surely be able to use his educational background to address current malpractices, so that the people will move more towards the path of peace, and he will also be able to provide great assistance to Special Envoy Marshall, so that his arduous mission can be completed in the end.</p>
<p>Today, the political situation in the Far East depends entirely on the close cooperation between China and the United States, but the power of Britain and the Soviet Union, especially the Soviet Union in the north, is also a major factor in stabilizing the Far East. Dr. Stuart has been in the north for a long time and knows the movements of the Soviet Union well. Then he should be able to do his best to further promote a thorough understanding between China and the Soviet Union and the United States and the Soviet Union, thereby laying a solid foundation for peace in the Far East. We welcome this new ambassador not only for China, but also for the Far East and for the world.</p>

<h3>The Three Provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Establish Silk Reeling Loans with a Total Amount of 10 Billion, Zhejiang Can Receive Half of the Allocation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou Express] Silk manufacturers in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces previously appealed to the Executive Yuan, requesting that the Four Joint Offices be instructed to provide silk reeling loans of 12 billion to prevent silk mills from shutting down due to lack of funds. Now, the Zhongfu Company and the Shanghai Silver Group of the Central Bank have settled the matter and approved the loan amount of 10 billion, stipulating that the degree of uniformity be 20 and 22 points at 900,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight), and 13 and 15 points at 1.2 million yuan per dan. The loan will be paid after each batch of five dan of silk is produced. The Zhejiang District Collection and Management Office received a telegram from Shanghai on the 9th, stating that the loan was formally signed on the 8th. Manufacturers in Zhejiang Province can sign contracts with the management office separately after the original copy of the contract is sent, and follow the procedures for payment. After the implementation of this loan, the silk mills can be fully operational. At the same time, the 75,000 dan of dried cocoon purchased by the government from Japan have been concentrated in Kobe. General Manager Ge of Zhongfu has completed the passport procedures in Shanghai and will go to receive them with Director Du of the Technical Department in order to transport them back to China to be used as raw materials for various silk mills. It is said that the silk mills in Zhejiang Province can be allocated 5 billion yuan from this silk reeling loan.</p>

<p>Military Police Arrest a Derelict Official</p>
<p>Zhou Weixin, a lieutenant adjutant of a certain regiment in Shanghai, is thirty years old. He often frequented singing halls and dance halls. Last month, he met a beautiful young woman named Wang Bingzhong. After pursuing her with all his might, they eventually had an affair and got engaged. Zhou spent lavishly for more than a month and was in dire financial straits. He secretly sold public property and embezzled public funds. When his superiors discovered this, Zhou, fearing punishment, took a large sum of public funds and fled through the border. He first went to Nanjing, then to Changshu, and then married Wang Bingzhong. On the 5th of this month, he came to Suzhou with his family to seek a job, using the alias Huang Jianan. He stayed at the Lixiang Hotel at No. 113. After the military police team stationed in Suzhou learned of the situation, they arrested him on the 8th and will send him to be dealt with according to law soon.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>A Fake County Magistrate Rampages in Tai Lake</p>
<p>Before the war, Tai Lake was always a lair for bandits. The government believed that the lake surface was vast and beyond its reach, so the bandits' whereabouts were constantly being suppressed. After the victory, the enemy bandits collapsed. Yang Yibin, a local resident who had served as the director of the puppet Jiangsu Security Office and the puppet county magistrate of Wuxi and Wujiang, claimed to be the commander-in-chief of Tai Lake. Recently, the self-defense team of Huazhuang Town in the area received secret reports that a large number of lake bandits, more than 3,000 people, were using more than 40 ships. They were divided into four teams, implementing abductions for ransom and looting passing merchants. A team was specially dispatched to patrol to prevent banditry. A few days ago, a villager named Feng from Jing County, who often transported water from Changxing, Zhejiang, to Wuxi for sale, was intercepted by lake bandits on the way through Cangshan in Tai Lake and robbed of many valuable clothes and 6 million national currency.</p>

<p>At 2:00 PM on the 5th of this month, more than 8,000 Communist troops, carrying more than ten cannons, launched a fierce attack on the National Army's positions in Yaojiadai and Shilibu in Taixing. The artillery fire was unprecedentedly intense. The Communist troops only began to withdraw after 9:00 AM on the 6th, but they are still gathering nearby, appearing to be preparing to attack Taixing County.</p>

<p>National Army Captures Disguised Bandits</p>
<p>Eight new bandits here, disguised as egg vendors, were passing through the Pulu Highway. After being questioned by the National Army, one of the bandits attempted to escape and was shot, but not killed. He has now been taken to the 58th Brigade for interrogation. Seven bandits infiltrated the urban area to gather information. Among them were a monk and a rural woman. They were captured a few days ago and handed over to the county government for custody, pending disposal.</p>

<p>The Municipal Office Plans to Establish a New Power Plant</p>
<p>The existing power plant here has outdated machinery, and its power generation efficiency is gradually declining. The Municipal Preparatory Office recently plans to set up a new plant in Bengbu. Director Zhang Xuexin of the Bureau of Public Works was sent to Shanghai to contact the Executive Headquarters to purchase and transport new machines. The result was very satisfactory. It will cost more than 30,000 yuan. The Municipal Office is actively raising funds.</p>

<p>Implementing a Surprise Household Registration Check</p>
<p>In order to tighten household administration and maintain public security, the county government, together with the county party headquarters and the police station, implemented a surprise household registration check starting on the night of the 1st of this month. It was divided into four groups with 28 subgroups. 112 inspectors were deployed by the county self-defense brigade to conduct patrols and inspections by bao and jia (administrative divisions). That night, they found 13 unregistered households and suspects, who were sent to the police station for investigation according to law.</p>
<h3>Correction Letter</h3>
<p>I have read the news item on page 2 of your newspaper on July 7th, which stated that Lu Facheng served as a border area committee member in the puppet regime, which is not true. It was found that in May of the 29th year, the puppet organization unilaterally published a notice listing Facheng as a puppet border area committee member. At that time, Facheng was the county magistrate of Qingpu. After reading the newspaper, he wrote to clarify the facts. In June of the same year, he reported to the Third War Zone Headquarters and the Jiangsu Provincial Government and received telegrams of commendation. He was also appointed to continue working in the Jiangnan Administrative Office until the victory, without ever stepping into the occupied area. The facts are all there. I am writing to request a correction. Sincerely, Lu Facheng</p>

<h3>Soviet Representative Relinquishes Stubborn Attitude The Peace Conference Will Be Convened by the Five Powers The United Nations General Assembly Will Be Held on September 23rd The United States and the Soviet Union Engage in Heated Debate Over the German Question</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] London, 10th Broadcast: Britain and the United States achieved another important victory in the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference today, and this victory is closely related to China's dignity. After pressure from Britain and the United States, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov no longer opposes China becoming an invited nation to the 21-Nation Peace Conference. The Soviet Union's abandonment of its stubborn attitude makes people feel optimistic about the future of the peace conference.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 9th] Today, the Soviet Union showed its concession, and the Four Powers have decided to include China in the list of nations invited to the peace conference. According to the original plan, the 21-Nation Peace Conference was scheduled to be held in Paris on July 29th. The Soviet Union initially requested that China not be included in the list of nations invited to the peace conference, believing that this matter should be handled solely by the Four Powers. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, although he recognized that this move would be an insult to China, ultimately agreed to this request. The Chinese government protested this method, believing that it was far from the Moscow Agreement, which stipulated that the peace conference should be convened by the "Council of Foreign Ministers."</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 10th] The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference decided yesterday to request UN Secretary-General Lie to postpone the United Nations General Assembly, originally scheduled to be held on September 3rd, to September 23rd. Lie had previously sent a letter to the Foreign Ministers Conference, seeking opinions on the date of the UN General Assembly. Byrnes said that after the opening of the peace conference, the four foreign ministers still need to meet to discuss the final agreement of the peace treaty, so the date of the UN General Assembly must be postponed. As a result, it was agreed to change the date to September 23rd.</p>
<p>Regarding the procedural law of the 21-Nation Peace Conference, the four foreign ministers reached a complete agreement after some amendments. Regarding the Trieste issue, at Byrnes's suggestion, it was agreed to establish a special committee to study the status of the port and submit a report before the convening of the peace conference.</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 9th] The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference entered its final stage this afternoon. After the agreement on the issuance of invitations was reached last night, it cleared the way for discussing the complex issue of Germany. The four foreign ministers discussed the German issue until 7:30 PM. Molotov severely criticized U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes's 25-year plan for the management of Germany, which was proposed on April 29th, and advocated extending it to 40 years. Byrnes also retorted sharply, saying that this treaty only aims to disarm Germany and does not involve issues such as reparations, which he has suggested be discussed separately by representatives of the foreign ministers. With less than three weeks until the convening of the peace conference and the Foreign Ministers Conference coming to an end, conference officials expect that there will not be any progress in resolving the German issue during this period. Britain and the United States will submit a report on the German issue at the next Foreign Ministers Conference. After the German issue, there are still the political issues of Austria and Italy, which are still on the official agenda of the Foreign Ministers Conference.</p>
<h3>Abyssinia Opposes the Decision on Italian Territories</h3>
<p>Submitting a Protest to the Four Foreign Ministers</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] New York, 10th Broadcast: Abyssinia today submitted a strong protest to the Four Powers through diplomatic channels, opposing the decision made at the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference to postpone the final decision on Italian colonies for one year. It stated that if Italian East Africa is still returned to Italy, it will be an unreasonable act and will affect the economic stability of the region.</p>
<h3>Those Arrested in Trieste Hold a Mass Hunger Strike Demanding Soviet Intervention</h3>
<p>[Reuters Trieste, 9th] After many people were arrested in the recent riots in Trieste, they began a hunger strike at midnight on Saturday and demanded that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov intervene "to protect the democratic organizations of Venezia Giulia." The number of people arrested is unknown, but it is reported that there are about a hundred people in the Via Cologna prison.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Violates the Moscow Agreement British and American Newspapers Unanimously Criticize Concessions to This Are a Disgrace</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency New York, 8th Special Dispatch] The New York Times commented today on the Soviet Foreign Minister's insistence on obstructing China from being an invited nation to the peace conference, saying, "This is clearly directed by its distorted Far East policy." The article criticized the Soviet Union for violating its own previous agreement and pointed out that the Foreign Ministers Conference held in Moscow last October included China. The article attacked the Soviet Union's insistence on the Four Powers formulating the rules of procedure for the peace conference, saying, "No representative of any country can tolerate such an order proposed by the Soviet Union." Furthermore, "The Soviet Union's desire to forcibly formulate the rules of procedure for the peace conference undoubtedly attempts to make the peace conference, like the Security Council, succumb to its will and be unable to take action." The newspaper said that if democratic countries concede on this point, it will make the entire peace conference merely a disgrace.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency London, 9th Special Dispatch] The Daily Telegraph commented on the Soviet Union's firm rejection of China from being among the nations invited to the peace conference, saying that its heart is too narrow. All newspapers carried China's protest, but the Daily Telegraph is still the only one to write a critique.</p>
<h3>Philippine President Roxas Meets With Our Reporter for the First Time He Says the Sino-Philippine Trade Agreement Will Be Signed Soon Overseas Chinese in the Philippines Will Receive Equal Treatment</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Reporter Li Yipei Manila, 8th] This reporter visited Philippine President Roxas at the Malacañang Palace this afternoon and asked about the Philippines' one-boat policy toward overseas Chinese. He replied that overseas Chinese in the Philippines will receive the most favored nation status and privileges stipulated by international law and will receive equal opportunities and protection under the law. The Philippines has laws that treat all ethnic groups equally. The other two foreign reporters, Boda of the Philadelphia Bulletin and Ms. Linde of the American "This Week" magazine, were also present. This is the second time that the Philippine President has met with foreign reporters since taking office, but it is the first time that he has met with a reporter from our country. President Roxas spoke about the Sino-Philippine trade agreement that is about to be signed and said that he hopes the agreement "will be signed soon." He said that China will receive the most favored nation clause equivalent to that of other countries, but not the same as the United States. Because the Philippines still maintains a special relationship with the United States, advisors from the U.S. State Department will assist the Republic of the Philippines in concluding various trade agreements with other countries. The reporter asked whether the Philippine government intends to send a commercial delegation abroad. President Roxas replied that the current focus of the Philippine people is on importing from abroad rather than exporting, so there is no such plan at present. The issue of establishing an embassy or legation in Nanjing has not been fully decided. When talking about the date of his visit to China, the reporter assured him that the Chinese government and people would warmly welcome him. He smiled and replied, "Thank you for telling me, I am very grateful. I am eager to visit China, because I have been to your country many times. When I was nine years old, I went to Guangzhou, but because there are many tasks to be dealt with at present, I am afraid that I will not be able to make the trip in the near future."</p>
<h3>Our Delegation to the Philippines Will Leave the Philippines for Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Manila, 9th] Our delegation to the Philippines is scheduled to fly directly to Shanghai on the morning of the 11th on the same plane. Special Envoy Gan Naiguang and Consul General Duan Maolan visited U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines McNutt at 2:00 PM this afternoon for a 30-minute meeting. It is reported that Gan handed over several photos given by Chairman Chiang to McNutt. Trade negotiations between China and the Philippines have not yet begun. As Roxas hinted, the Sino-Philippine trade agreement may be signed after the delegation leaves the Philippines.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Gu Weijun Visits Acheson</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service Washington, 9th] Before presenting his credentials to President Truman, the new Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, visited Acting Secretary of State Acheson for the first time today. Ambassador Gu then told reporters that he hoped that the mission of President's Special Envoy General Marshall in China would be successful and that a solution to all problems could be found.</p>
<h3>The Control Council for Japan Meets U.S. Representative Acheson Attacks Communism Points Out That the Labor Law Contains a Strong Ideological Flavor and Is Not Applicable to a Democratized Japan</h3>
<p>[Remodeling Society Tokyo, 10th] The Four-Power Control Council for Japan met this morning to discuss: (1) the issue of returning Japanese to normal life, (2) the issue of quarantine, (3) the issue of preventing infectious diseases, (4) the food and drug law, (5) the law on controlling unified food salespersons and food distribution agencies (above are proposals by MacArthur), (6) the issue of the War Investigation Committee, (7) Japan's labor law, (8) the issue of military compensation (above are proposals by the Soviet representative).</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo, 10th Special Dispatch] The atmosphere at the Four-Power Council for Japan meeting this morning was quite discordant. The reason was that British representative Bower was interrupted twice by the meeting's chairman, U.S. representative Acheson, when explaining the issue of integrating the repatriated Japanese soldiers and civilians into their national life was related to all other issues. Later, the meeting was frustrated because the representatives refused to discuss the four new matters proposed by MacArthur. The reason for the representatives' refusal to discuss the four matters was that the matters were too specialized and not related to the government controlling Japan only. Our representative Zhu Shuming declared that if the above request was insisted upon, the Chinese government would be prepared to provide experts on the above issues to the Allied Headquarters. The British and Soviet representatives also made similar statements.</p>
<p>[Remodeling Society Telegraph] Then the Soviet representative put forward its proposed amendment to the labor law, advocating that when the factory closes the factory, the workers should directly manage the factory's production on behalf of the factory. Acheson then made an important speech on this, fiercely criticizing the definition of common production, saying that it is necessary to ask questions about the Soviet Union's proposals, and that many of the first suggestions have been implemented and should not be submitted to the Committee for discussion as a new proposal. The goal of labor in Japan is to establish democratic principles, and Japanese labor laws and regulations should be decided according to these principles. If detailed instructions are encountered, the United Nations may be accused of dictatorship and violate the Potsdam Declaration. The Supreme Commander does not intend to forcibly enforce various regulations on Japan during military occupation, because forcibly enforcing things is contrary to the freedom that we are giving the Japanese at this time. After carefully examining the Soviet Union's proposal, I felt that it had ideological colors and was propagandistic. It is regrettable that communism and even the labor problems of communists are occurring in Japan today. I dare not criticize the Soviet Union's communist system, but I do not want to cultivate communism in Japan. I only want to make Japan implement democratic principles, and the Japanese are also striving to obtain the benefits of democracy for their own welfare.</p>
<h3>Seven Poison Gas Depots Discovered in Kure, Japan</h3>
<p>Storing 1,700 Tons of Gas</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 8th] According to the Japanese Affairs Office, seven poison gas depots have been discovered near Kure, Japan, containing 1,700 tons of egg gas, including mustard gas, Lewisite, tear gas, smoke bombs, and other types of poison gas, stored in containers, bombs, or tanks.</p>
<h3>General Zhu Shuming Reviews U.S. Cavalry Division in Tokyo, Saluted with Eleven Gun Salute</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] Zhu Shuming, the head of the Chinese delegation to the Allied Control Council for Japan, reviewed the U.S. First Cavalry Division and tank squadron stationed in Japan this afternoon upon invitation. After the review, Lieutenant General Chase, the division commander, invited General Zhu to lunch. When General Zhu arrived at the division's camp surrounding Tokyo, he was greeted by an honor guard, and Chase personally welcomed him. According to Zhu's rank, he was honored with an eleven-gun salute. The First Cavalry Division then marched past the reviewing stand in a majestic manner, followed by a simple award ceremony.

<h3>Where is the Kwantung Army? U.S. Newspaper Says Not a Single One Has Returned to Japan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 8th] The New York Times, mentioning the fate of the Kwantung Army, acknowledges that captured Japanese soldiers have returned to Japan, but there have been no reports of any Kwantung Army soldiers returning. The Times reported, "The United States should pay attention to the whereabouts of this large army, as the Soviet Union has used this army as a tool to demand concessions from us and the British at the Yalta Conference." The newspaper further reported that the Kwantung Army and all Japanese troops in North Korea and Sakhalin Island have been transported to Siberia, while approximately 200,000 people have been moved from Shenyang to the Lake Baikal region. It is said that their job is to relocate factories from China to that region, so the fate of the Kwantung Army remains a mystery.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 10th Broadcast: Nehru declared at a meeting of the Indian National Congress today that India will conclude an important agreement with Britain, which will be realized before the establishment of the Indian interim government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Bombay, 10th] Nehru held his first press conference since taking office as Chairman of the National Congress Party, stating that the National Congress Party cannot accept any treaty that Britain wants to impose on India, nor can it accept its attempt to retain its vested interests in India. If it can be accepted, the National Congress Party does not have any tasks for the Constituent Assembly, only knowing how to serve the people.</p>
<p>The powers of the Constituent Assembly are now limited to two matters, namely (1) minority ethnic issues, and (2) treaties with India. Minority ethnic issues are purely domestic matters, and we all hope to achieve satisfactory solutions. Regarding the future relationship between Britain and India, we also hope to establish a treaty of peace. Once the National Congress Party participates in the Constituent Assembly, it will work to achieve it. The National Congress Party will first study the situation created by the British delegation's recommendations.</p>

<h3>"Atomized Coal" Powder Engine: High Speed and Low Cost</h3>
<p>[United Press, Baltimore, 9th] The United States has recently invented a locomotive powered by coal, which is said to be faster than diesel-powered locomotives and will soon be tested. The locomotive's power comes from a gas turbine that burns coal powder as fine as talcum powder.  This "atomized" coal powder is cheaper than diesel fuel. The Locomotive Improvement Research Committee, affiliated with the U.S. Coal Research Institute, said that the new gas turbine locomotive has been successful. The research of the new locomotive is being led by engineering physicist Yerutti. The new locomotive operates as follows: First, coal is crushed and ground into powder, then blown into a disperser by compressed airflow, turning it into a fine powder, which enters the burner and is burned with compressed air. The combustion of coal powder generates tremendous heat, increasing the air temperature and rotating a high-speed turbine. The turbine can then drive a generator to supply electricity and turn the wheels.</p>
<h3>International Tribunal Prosecutor Reads Documents from Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Liquidating the Blood Debt of Japanese Aggression Against China: Araki and Tanaka's Confessions Expose Conspiracy: Roosevelt's Telegram to the Japanese Emperor Repeated</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] The International Tribunal prosecutor, while continuing to summarize Araki Sadao's confession today, stated that Araki Sadao revealed that, in addition to the three northeastern provinces, Jehol Province was also included in the Kwantung Army's occupation area to prevent Zhang Xueliang from using the province as a base for a counterattack against the Northeast. This was decided in a secret council meeting in Japan and later unanimously approved by the Imperial Conference. Participants in the Imperial Conference included cabinet members and advisors to the Privy Council. At that time, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Forbes telegraphed the U.S. Secretary of State stating that the Japanese government had assured him that Chinese sovereignty would not be harmed. On December 1, 1931, the Japanese government sent officials to the U.S. Embassy in Japan to assure Ambassador Forbes that Japan would not expand the Northeast Incident to the point where China lost its sovereignty. Forbes then continued in the telegram: "The Japanese are still actively preparing for further incursions into the Northeast in the future, and the Japanese military once they have the opportunity to act freely, can launch". The first telegram was sent on November 24, 1931. It stated that Japanese Foreign Minister Kijuro Shidehara had notified Forbes that the Japanese Prime Minister, Minister of the Army, and Chief of Staff had agreed not to allow war in Jinzhou. Because banditry was rampant in the Northeast, Japanese residents in the area needed the protection of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Six Years of Aggression</p>
<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 10th] Next, the prosecutor read the section of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' announcement of "Japanese Military Aggressions from September 18, 1931, to August 3, 1937" titled "Japanese Military Occupation of the Four Provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Jehol," stating: "After occupying Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, the Japanese military continued its plan to invade the west. After the end of the Shanghai War in the spring of 1932, it strengthened its military force in the northeastern provinces. In mid-July 1932, the Japanese, on the pretext of the disappearance of Japanese army officer Ishimoto, began attacking Jehol. In July and August, they launched two general offensives, but they were resisted by the Chinese army and made no progress. At the beginning of 1933, war broke out at Juyuanguan, Shanhaiguan, and Jiumentou fell successively, and the situation between China and Japan worsened. On February 22 of the same year, the Japanese, in the name of the puppet 'Manchukuo', issued an ultimatum to China, claiming that Jehol was not Chinese territory and demanding that Chinese troops in Jehol Province withdraw within 24 hours. On February 25 of the same year, fighting began. The Japanese army launched a general offensive from the bases of Tongda and Suiyuan. On March 2 of the same year, Jehol Province was also occupied by Japan for military and political reasons."</p>
<p>Prosecutor Liu Ailin then read the full text of the Tanggu Truce Agreement, and Prosecutor Haider then presented various evidentiary documents. Finally, the court adjourned the hearing due to the hot weather, and it will resume on the morning of the 15th, when ventilation equipment can be installed in the courtroom. Wiebe said: "This is an unprecedented major case, and we should have reasonable comfort."</p>
<p>Tanggu Truce Agreement [Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 10th] After the Japanese aggression against the Northeast, they then forcibly attempted to seize North China, which was testified by former Military Affairs Bureau Chief Yuzhong Takashi in court. At that time, Deputy Minister of National Defense Tsung-chun, who was in charge in North China with Doihara, will also testify in court. The truth at that time will surely come to light. According to the Japanese invasion of North China, the Shanhaiguan incident on New Year's Day in 1935 marked the beginning. After the occupation of Jehol Province in March, it came to an end, and then the Xu Yue Great Wall went south. At that time, the Kwantung Army was doing its best to carry out political work. In April, the Japanese army challenged Gutsu and attacked various passes of the Great Wall. In May, they approached Pingjin, resulting in the establishment of the Tanggu Truce Agreement. From the establishment of the agreement to the establishment of the pseudo-organization in eastern Hebei in December of the same year, the work of the Japanese invasion of North China was roughly successful. Japan carried out military and political work in this way, causing the July 7th Incident. The reasons are as follows: (1) The Tanggu Truce Agreement (May) made the Pingjin area a demilitarized zone, and Japan re-consolidated its basis for sweeping North China and excluding our central forces from the five provinces of North China. (2) The Bomei Agreement (June) officially recognized the Tanggu Truce Agreement. (3) The Zhangbei Incident (June) Four Japanese soldiers forcibly passed through Zhangjiakou (4) The Doihara and Qin Dechun Agreement (June), Japan resolved the Zhangbei Incident by this agreement, expelled the central forces of Chahar Province, and supported De...(5) The Fengtai Incident (September), on the pretext of the conflict between the Chinese and Japanese armies in Fengtai, increased the garrison force of the Japanese army. (6) The Bailing Temple Incident (from summer to autumn), the Dewang, manipulated by the Japanese army, had an armed conflict with General Chuan Zuoyi, and Japan failed. (7) The establishment of the so-called Eastern Hebei Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee, Yin Rugeng was willing to be a puppet, organized a regime, and was used by the Japanese army politically and economically. (8) The establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee (December) At that time, Japan attempted to appease General Song Zheyuan, who had strength in North China, and appointed him as the chairman of the committee to separate North China from the central government. Doihara was very active at that time.</p>
<p>Eve of Pearl Harbor</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 9th] What was Emperor Hirohito's reaction to President Roosevelt's personal telegram in late 1941 urging a final peace? The matter is now being raised again. A few weeks ago, it was expected that this issue would be thoroughly explored in the war crimes trials. According to Yamamoto, who was then the head of the American Affairs Section of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Emperor received the telegram and prepared a hopeful reply shortly before the Pearl Harbor attack. However, according to former Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Kido, who told reporters last September that Hirohito refused to answer the telegram because cabinet ministers told him that "resisting the domestic war trend would be futile." Currently, only a few people know the truth about this matter. One of them is former Foreign Minister Togo. It is generally believed that Togo received the telegram from former U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew that morning and immediately submitted it to the Emperor. Opinions differ among other Japanese regarding various issues during this important period. One of them claimed that the Emperor received the telegram at the Imperial Conference, retired to his private quarters, and wept over the difficulty of ensuring peace, but this claim has not been confirmed. Yamamoto did not attend the meeting, so he only received the report indirectly. He learned that Togo had shelved the telegram of President Roosevelt until 25 minutes after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor before submitting it to the Emperor. The Emperor then personally began to draft a reply expressing his desire for peace. Some witnesses in court strongly argued that the Emperor received full reports on the Manchurian Incident but was powerless to stop it.</p>
<p>Tanaka's Testimony Completed</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] Lieutenant General Tanaka Ryukichi, who testified for the prosecution and was questioned by defense lawyers in the war crimes trials for the past four days, left the witness stand this afternoon. Some lawyers attempted to dismiss his testimony by claiming that he was mentally deranged, but they failed.</p>
<p>Reading of Nanjiro's Speech</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] The Tokyo International Tribunal prosecutor submitted to the International Tribunal a summary of the speech delivered by former Japanese Army Minister Nanjiro at a meeting of Japanese division commanders in 1931, as published in Japanese newspapers, as an official record. The speech criticized China's policies, which were unfavorable to Japan, and emphasized that Manchuria and Mongolia should maintain close relations, regardless of whether viewed from the perspective of national defense or political economy. The defense lawyers strongly opposed submitting only a summary to the court and demanded the submission of the full text of the speech. They criticized the prosecutor for presenting such evidence, saying, "I know the prosecutor has the full text in hand." The prosecutor proved that he was indeed unable to obtain the full text, and the defense lawyers withdrew their criticism and apologized to him.</p>

<h3>Investigation of the Major Corruption Case in the Railway Bureau: Female Employees Appear in Court Together: Candidly Narrating the Inside Story of Embezzlement: All Bribery Suspects Bow Their Heads in Admission, but the Director Still Says He Knows Nothing: Yu Xiangyan Throws Another "Letter"</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The major corruption case in the Railway Bureau was opened for investigation again by Prosecutor Quan at 11:30 AM yesterday. Those who were brought in for questioning included five suspects, namely the main offender, Director of Materials Zhang Hongtu, and accomplices Chen Jingyao, Zhang Bokang, Jing Weijun, and Ding Shuhui. Secret informants Huang Ruzhen and Shen Guizhang were also summoned at the same time. Yesterday morning, at about 9:00 AM, the suspects were brought out of the detention center by bailiffs, and soon after, the informants also reported to the District Procuratorate. Shen and Huang were originally female employees of the bureau. During yesterday's interrogation, Shen Guizhang wore a black silk cheongsam and white leather shoes, while Huang Ruzhen wore a pink short cheongsam with small floral patterns and white leather shoes barefoot. They were both in their twenties and reported the case because they did not want to accept the embezzled funds of 200,000 yuan per person. It is said that Zhang Hongtu received 30% of all the embezzled funds, Deputy Director Jing Weijun and Materials Section Zhang Bokang each received 20%, and the remaining 30% was distributed to employees Yu Peien, Ding Shuhui, Zhang Zelong, Wang Renmao, Zhu Peizong, Gu Zhenmin, Zhu Biwen, Xia Dingwu, Chen Jingyao, Li Jie, Sun Xuesan, Li Runsheng, and Zhang Kaiyuan. Because Shen and Huang described the details of the embezzlement and distribution of spoils in great detail, the bribery suspects had to admit to the bribes. Only the main suspect Zhang Hongtu continued to deny everything. The interrogation ended at 1:30 PM. Shen Guizhang and Huang Ruzhen were both ordered to return home, while the other suspects were still sent back to the detention center. Also, Xu Chuangui, He Zhidao, and He Zu'en have been transferred from the Railway Bureau to the District Procuratorate. After a brief interrogation, they were also detained in the detention center. It is heard that their crimes are relatively minor. However, according to Prosecutor Quan's statement to reporters, he intends to resolve the case as soon as possible, so all suspects will not be easily granted bail. Currently, except for Yu Xiangyan, who is still at large, and worker Li Runsheng, who has been released on bail, the other eighteen defendants are temporarily detained in the District Court detention center for daily interrogation. It is also reliably informed that Prosecutor Quan will open the court again this morning to investigate Zhang Hongtu and other suspects.</p>
<h3>Another Staff Member Colluded in Fraud</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] Yu Xiangyan, a key figure in the Road Bureau fraud case who has not yet turned himself in, sent another letter to this newspaper yesterday. He included copies of letters to Chen Bozhuang, the Director of the Two Road Bureaus, and Wang Zhaohuai, the Chief of the Police Department, in which he defended himself. Excerpts from the original letters are as follows: (1) "…The occurrence of the Two Road Bureaus fraud case has an inside story, the main reason being a lack of cooperation with them… Fortunately, the current authorities are not lacking in virtuous officials, and we will eventually have our grievances redressed…." (2) "Director Chen Bozhuang of the Two Road Bureaus convened a meeting of the bureau's staff and made the following statement: 'The truth of the case is clear: the principal offender is Yu Xiangyan. Zhang Hongtu is being held because his wife fled. He will be released once his wife arrives. He is required to return the funds to the public within 48 hours. Yu Xiangyan carried away 80 million yuan in fraudulent funds, and Zhang Hongtu is required to find his wife.' Chief Wang Zhaohuai said, 'Even if Yu Xiangyan cannot be said to be the principal offender, since she and the principal offender Zhang Hongtu are husband and wife, she is naturally one of the principals.'... It seems that what these two officials say and do represents a national institution. Which side should I believe? If I listen to Chief Wang, it seems that, in the eyes of the law, I have not committed a crime. I am merely the wife of a criminal. If I believe Director Chen, the evidence is solid, my wife is the principal offender, and Zhang Hongtu is only suffering for his wife who fled…" The postmark on the letter shows that it was still mailed from this city. It is also learned that after the Road Bureau and Police Department transferred the relevant suspects to the District Procuratorate, the procuratorate discovered that Wang Sanchuan, an employee of the Shanghai materials warehouse of the Materials Department, was also suspected of colluding in the fraud. He was taken into custody. After interrogation, solid evidence was found, and he was sent to the District Procuratorate on the morning of the 9th to be processed together with the other suspects. Rumors that the Road Bureau has discovered a new fraud case are not true.</p>

<h3>Zhang Sumin on Trial - Stubbornly Refused to Admit Guilt</h3>

The court adjourned for further trial.</p>

<h3>Authorities Encourage Citizens to Report Private Possession of Firearms</h3>
<p>(This Newspaper) In order to prevent the occurrence of illegal activities due to the private possession of firearms, the Municipal Police Department has specifically requested the Civil Affairs Department to expand publicity and encourage citizens to report those who possess firearms privately.

<h3>Visiting the Women's Prison</h3>
<p>The First Sub-Prison of the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison is the only women's prison in the city. Usually, it is heavily guarded. Heavy locks are added to the large iron doors one after another, making it impossible for outsiders to enter. Yesterday, the reporter was invited by Warden Di to visit the prison and felt that all the facilities inside could be called a model for Chinese women's prisons.</p>
<p>The prison is divided into five floors. The bottom floor is the office for the staff. The second floor is the prison cells for female traitors. There are currently seven traitors, large and small, imprisoned inside. Among them is She Aizhen, a female traitor known for her mercilessness.</p>
<p>The third floor is the prison cells for ordinary prisoners. The rooms have new-style sanitation equipment, each for six people, with "tatami" mats laid on top. Although the rooms are not large, they are large enough for six people to stretch out and sleep. When the reporter visited, the rooms were empty because the prisoners had gone to the workshop to work. According to the warden, the lives of the prisoners in the prison are very disciplined. Every day from 6:00 AM to 8:00 AM is the time for literacy and exercise. From 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM, they have to do production work for the prison. Therefore, those who stay in the prison cells during the day, apart from the old and weak elderly women, are mothers with babies. It turns out that these people's husbands have died, and they have no relatives at home. They committed crimes (most of them are guilty of selling heroin), and there is no one to take care of the children in their arms. The prison makes special allowances for these prisoners, allowing them to bring their children in, and gives special treatment to these innocent children, allowing them to drink a little milk every day. It is said that two of the babies were born in the prison, and their mothers have been sentenced to eleven years in prison. So, although this child who grew up in prison cannot be said to be out of touch with the world, what difference will there be when he steps out of the prison gate at the age of eleven and sees everything outside that is colorful and dazzling, and the scene of a blind person seeing the light of day again?</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Dining Hall</p>
<p>There are workshops and dining halls on each floor of the prison. When the reporter approached the dining hall, the prison guard shouted "Stand up" in a solemn tone! The trained prisoners inside put down their work and stood up, their polite expressions touching people and arousing sympathy. When the reporter arrived at the dining hall, it was almost noon, so the prisoners were busy cooking. Rows of freshly cooked tomatoes and greens were placed on the long table, the colors of red and green intertwined, plus the steaming steam, were really tempting! But these beautiful dishes are for the exclusive use of the prison staff. The prisoners' diet is regulated by the prison. There are two meals a day, the first at 9:00 AM in the morning and the second at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The amount is 20 liang (about three bowls) of white rice per meal, 4 liang of vegetarian dishes, 2 liang of meat (specially delivered by the catering company, choosing the cheaper ones on the vegetable market every day), and 1 qian of oil. Because women have small appetites, these rations are probably not enough to keep them from starving.</p>
<p>A Small Scene in the Workshop</p>
<p>Walking along the dining hall is the workshop. The workshop is divided into three parts. The first room is dedicated to making women's cheongsams and is equipped with two Western-style machines. The second room is dedicated to making prison uniforms, because the prisoners in the prison must wear uniform blue cloth uniforms. Currently, because the prison uniforms are not enough, the prisoners are rushing to make them. The third room is dedicated to knitting wool. Colorful wool threads are piled up on the long table. These are all jobs brought in from the outside. According to the person in charge, these female prisoners are very smart, and they can do very well with just a little guidance. When the reporter stepped into the workshop, there was silence in the room. Rows of neat prisoners were all immersed in their work, and the good order made people admire the authorities' effective management.</p>
<p>Statistics on Female Prisoners</p>
<p>There are a total of 127 prisoners in the Shanghai Women's Prison, most of whom are drug dealers, totaling 79. In addition, there are also cases of murder, robbery, fraud, public morals, obstruction of family, injury, and death. The average age is mostly between 30 and 45 years old. The youngest is 15 years old, and the oldest is 65 years old. There are two foreign prisoners, one Austrian and one Russian, who are accomplices in the same case. The crime they committed is very serious. It is said that they killed a person in a wine shop. One of them is the only one who has been sentenced to death.</p>
<h3>Unbearable to Recall the Film Star - The Tragic and Miserable Yuan Meiyun</h3>
<p>Among these prisoners, the most noticeable are the film stars Yuan Meiyun and Xia Peizhen, who are guilty of drug addiction. Xia Peizhen has been suffering from toothache recently, so she is sleeping in the sick ward. When Yuan Meiyun was first admitted, she was often uncomfortable due to stomach problems, but recently she has fully recovered, so her life is very normal. She and Xia Peizhen share a room with a total of six people, all of whom are smokers. According to the sentence, she will be released from prison on October 11, but it is said that she can be released early because, in fact, she is no longer addicted. When the reporter visited, she was sitting quietly knitting wool in the workshop. Her fair skin seemed even fatter than in the movies. From the outside, it was impossible to find a trace of drug use. When the reporter stepped into the workshop, she looked up, with a smile on her face, but when she caught sight of the photographer's camera, she immediately lowered her head. After the first photo was taken, her head was even lower. When the second photo was taken, she even covered her face with a handkerchief and immediately cried. The reporter was initially surprised why Yuan Meiyun was so good at crying, but then she thought, this is no wonder. When the limelight lights up, she will immediately recall her star career that was active under the spotlight in the past. Looking back on the past and looking at the present, it is inevitable to shed a tear of tragic misery!</p>
<h3>Preparing to Host Reporters - Reporting on the Facts</h3>
<p>When the reporter asked her about her feelings in prison and her future plans, she refused to answer, saying that she has been in a bad mood recently, and expressed great dissatisfaction with this sentence. She said that after her release, she plans to host reporters on a large scale, report on the facts, and talk about her future work.</p>
<p>According to the warden, Yuan Meiyun's husband, Wang Yin, had visited her in prison, but according to prison rules, prisoners are absolutely not allowed to be visited arbitrarily, so the couple did not meet. However, the warden sympathized with her, so he arranged another time for Wang Yin to come again, but Wang Yin said that since Yuan Meiyun's release date was not far away anyway, it would be better to save this effort to avoid being too emotional with each other. Therefore, they have not met until now.</p>
<p>According to the reporter's investigation: Yuan Meiyun has received the application from the Executive Supervisory Officer Chuan Bang to apply for exemption from the remaining sentence on her behalf. After the presiding judge Shen Tianbao of the District Court rules in the near future, the date of her restoration to freedom will be not far away. (Sacred Heart)</p>
<h3>West Pharmaceutical Factory Under Storms - Notes from Manager Bao of Sinyi Talking About Tablets</h3>
<p>Before victory, due to the near-complete cessation of foreign goods and wartime needs, the total number of West pharmaceutical factories in Shanghai reached over 170, and business was generally good. However, today, due to the dumping of foreign drugs and the Chinese people's blind faith in imported goods, only 70 West pharmaceutical factories remain in Shanghai, and most of these 70 are in a state of shutdown or semi-shutdown.</p>
<p>Only a few larger pharmaceutical factories, with more abundant resources and a longer history of production, are still producing day and night and managing to survive. Sinyi Pharmaceutical Factory is one of them.</p>
<p>Sinyi's main factory is on Zhongzheng Middle Road, but the largest factory building is not the main factory but rather Number 20 Masnan Road. In addition, there are also factories at 120 Lujia Road, 914 Beijing Road, 211 Putuo Road, and 670 Linsen Road, all of which are sizable pharmaceutical manufacturing plants. Recently, they also acquired a large factory at 82 Chongming Road, a five-story steel-reinforced concrete building with an area of 150,000 square feet, which was originally the Delerin Apartments. This high-rise building will likely become Sinyi's main factory in the future.</p>
<p>Mechanical Equipment</p>
<p>One of Sinyi's most valuable pieces of machinery is a "compound water distiller," which was shipped from the United States before the Pacific War. It is said to be the latest type of equipment. The distilled water from this type of distiller does not come into contact with the air at all, making it extremely clean. Injections made with this water can avoid all reactions and adverse side effects. In Shanghai, only Sinyi has this excellent equipment.</p>
<p>In addition, they also have single water distillers, air conditioning equipment, rotary tablet presses, new tablet presses, automatic ampule manufacturing machines, and more, a truly well-equipped factory.</p>
<p>Chinese Herbs Prepared with Western Methods</p>
<p>Most Chinese medicinal herbs are plant-based, and they have unique efficacy in medical theory. Unfortunately, the preparation of Chinese medicines is not scientific enough, which reduces their effectiveness. Therefore, there have long been advocates for preparing Chinese herbs with Western methods, and experiments have been conducted. Sinyi has achieved considerable success in preparing Chinese herbs with Western methods. According to factory manager Bao Guochang, to date, Angelica, rhubarb, and Sichuan fritillary bulb have all begun to be prepared using Western methods. Among them, "Quisqualis indica" can replace "Santonin" after Western processing, and its efficacy is stronger than "Santonin." These Western-processed Chinese medicines are not only made into powders and pills, but also into injections. The injection made from the Chinese medicine "raw mountain sliced" is a very good hemostatic and cardiotonic agent.</p>
<p>Various Difficulties</p>
<p>Manager Bao is very right that the dumping of foreign goods is only the beginning. The real massive dumping will occur in 1947. At that time, if we don't have a way to resist, we will feel a hundred times the threat we feel now. Currently, British goods still have limited production, and the needs in various parts of Europe are still very large. The domestic needs in the United States are also very large, so the amount of pharmaceuticals coming to the Chinese market is still limited. By next year, most of their military factories will have been converted into pharmaceutical factories, and all the soldiers will have been demobilized. At that time, our chemical industry will be truly overwhelmed!</p>
<p>Our difficulties are: high labor costs, low production speeds, and raw materials that come from foreign countries, so we cannot compete. For example, the tariff rate for Western pharmaceutical raw materials is 25%, while the tariff rate for finished foreign pharmaceuticals is only 30%. How can our costs compete with theirs?</p>
<p>Moreover, their national banks often lend to pharmaceutical merchants at an interest rate of 1.5%, while our interest rates today are so high. Furthermore, in terms of machinery, the production speed of machinery from 1941 (which we consider to be the latest type) is 40 times slower than the latest machinery today. How can we compete with them?</p>
<p>However, Sinyi Pharmaceutical Factory will increase production in half a year with the same new equipment as the United States today, so the future is not too bleak. However, today, the future of our chemical industry is by no means just a problem for Sinyi alone. This is extremely obvious. (Suo Bei)</p>
<h3>An Interlude in the Rong Case: A Fake Culprit Leads to the Real Culprit - The Mystery of Deng Boyuan Unveiled</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Details of the capture of some of the main criminals in the Rong Desheng case have been recorded in this newspaper in the past two days. The arrest of the main criminals in the case, Lu Wenqing and Yuan Zhongzhu, benefited greatly from the widespread rumor in the city half a month ago that Deng Boyuan, the main criminal in the Rong case, had been arrested. According to reporters from relevant sources yesterday: Although Deng Boyuan did not participate in the kidnapping of Rong, he is not without indirect relationship to the Rong case. According to the facts, this person is also a figure in the lower class of society. After Mr. Rong was kidnapped, the police made every effort to investigate but had not yet gained any clues, Deng Boyuan suddenly came to inform, claiming that he had obtained some clues about the Rong case and was willing to assist in the investigation. At that time, the relevant authorities gave him some necessary expenses, instructing him to work hard. Unexpectedly, after Deng obtained the money, he not only did not engage in tracking down the Rong case kidnappers, but instead spent his days indulging in a certain "swallow's nest". The police then arrested him. At that time, the person leading the capture was a senior officer of the Garrison Headquarters. A police officer from the Police Bureau assisting at the scene asked whether it was the Rong case, and he vaguely responded in a hurry. The next day, it was widely rumored in the city that Deng Boyuan, the main criminal in the Rong case, had been arrested. In addition, the bandits who kidnapped Rong were divided into three gangs. In addition to Lu Wenqing, the leader of the Shanghai gang, and Yuan Zhongzhu, the leader of the Sheng County gang, who have already been arrested, another gang leader is still being intensively pursued.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The two people arrested by the Police Bureau, Zhan Rongpei and Zheng Liantang, were originally scheduled to be transferred to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters the day before yesterday, but were temporarily postponed due to the discovery of important clues during continued interrogation.

<h3>Mathematician Hua Luogeng Arrives in Beijing from Shanghai</h3>
<p>Should Go to the United States for Research in a Short Time</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Professor Hua Luogeng, an internationally renowned genius mathematician, came to Beijing from Shanghai on the 4th of this month. He has recently been hired by Princeton University in the United States and will go abroad for research in a short period of time for a period of one to two years. This spring, Mr. Hua was invited to the Mathematics Research Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and went to Moscow, Leningrad, and other places to give academic lectures and participate in academic research societies, which were extremely welcomed by the Soviet government and the public. Mr. Hua's creation of "Additive Prime Number Theory" was translated into Russian by Vinogradov, an authority in the Soviet mathematics community, and published by the Stakho Research Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Mr. Hua told reporters: "I stayed in the Soviet Union for 50 days this spring, and my deepest impression was that the Soviet Union promotes science with all its strength, scientists have a good life, and are highly respected by the government. The government awards the highest honor of the Soviet Union, the Hero of Labor, and the Stalin Medal to those who have made outstanding contributions to the scientific community." Regarding the situation of scientific research in China, Mr. Hua said that the government should pay attention to ensuring the livelihood of scientists. China's industry and natural science are much behind Western countries. If we want to seek the highly development of science, we must cultivate the foundation for training scientific research talents.</p>

<h3>Central Industrial College This Year's Enrollment Exam - Provinces Can Recommend Excellent Students</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Chongqing] The Central Industrial College has decided on matters concerning the enrollment of new students this year at a faculty meeting. It will recruit new students on the 15th of this month, holding examinations simultaneously in Chengdu and Chongqing. It has also sent letters to county middle schools in Sichuan Province, instructing them to recommend outstanding graduating students to study at the school.

<h3>Publicly Funded Students in Hubei Province</h3>
<p>Summer Vacation Leave Procedures</p>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Hankou] The Hubei Education Department's method for issuing public funds to publicly funded students who remain in school during this summer vacation is: one-third will be issued in July, none in August, and one-sixth will be issued in September. Publicly funded students who remain in school are deeply worried about this method and have repeatedly petitioned the Education Department to issue funds as before in order to maintain their livelihood. It is now heard that the Education Department has ordered each school to handle the situation with discretion from the remaining funds of the original public funds.</p>
<h3>Secondary School Textbooks: Ministry of Education Hastens Review</h3>
<p>Reducing Circulation of Erroneous Texts</p>
<p>[Ta Hua News Agency, Nanjing] Previously, for subjects in primary and secondary schools for which the Ministry of Education did not compile national textbooks, such as elementary school manual arts, drawing, singing and games, and secondary school English, mathematics, physics and chemistry, zoology and botany, mineralogy, physiology, hygiene, music, physical education, manual arts, home economics, and Boy Scouts, the Ministry of Education revised the curriculum standards between 1941 and 1942. These new standards differed significantly from the old standards of 1937. There was an urgent need to publish an authorized version of the new standards to coordinate with the national textbooks based on the new standards and facilitate teaching. This would embody the true meaning of "national textbooks and authorized textbooks being used concurrently." However, the number of textbooks compiled and submitted for review by various bookstores according to the new standards has been scarce. Those already submitted to the Ministry are being reviewed as quickly as possible to reduce the circulation of erroneous texts. Furthermore, according to Ministry of Education regulations, the National Institute for Compilation and Translation is the competent authority for textbook review. Current employees of the institute are prohibited from serving as chief editors or compilers of primary and secondary school textbooks for bookstores during their tenure to prevent corruption. Recently, the institute will thoroughly enforce this prohibition, and all textbook editing contracts between employees and bookstores will be declared invalid.</p>
<h3>Over a Thousand Demobilized Youth Army Soldiers Assigned to Universities</h3>
<p>More than Fifty Register for Government-Funded Overseas Study</p>
<p>[Ta Chung News Agency] According to the person in charge of the Demobilized Youth Army Committee, the issue of further education for demobilized Youth Army soldiers is being gradually resolved. Temporary university preparatory classes for the Youth Army have been established in Hangzhou and Yuyao. More than 1,700 demobilized Youth Army soldiers have registered for these classes. After rigorous screening, more than 600 were eliminated, leaving just over 1,100 admitted. Classes at the school began in July and will end in early September. Those who pass the final examinations will be assigned to various universities for further study. In addition, after the deadline for registration for government-funded and self-funded overseas students handled by the Municipal Bureau of Education, registration for government-funded overseas study for Youth Army soldiers continues. However, only just over fifty Youth Army soldiers have registered so far, indicating a lack of enthusiasm. The registration deadline will be July 13th.</p>
<h3>Encouraging Service in the Navy</h3>
<p>Another report: Among the demobilized Youth Army soldiers, many aspire to join the Navy. It is reported that, to cultivate naval talent and encourage Youth Army soldiers' interest in serving in the Navy, the naval authorities, after conducting an evaluation, have granted permission to more than 600 demobilized Youth Army soldiers to enlist. They will soon be led to England by Lieutenant Colonel Zheng Zhaoxiang, who is going to receive British-gifted ships, where they will undergo rigorous training abroad and then be assigned to various gifted ships.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Orders National Schools to Give Priority Admission to Children of War-Dead Soldiers: Public Schools Provide Free Education, Private Schools Also Give Priority to Free Quotas</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper report, Nanjing] Instruction No. 4525 from the Ministry of Education, addressed to the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities, states: "During the eight years of war, we were fortunate to have the loyal and brave soldiers of the nation fight valiantly and selflessly, ultimately achieving final victory. Now, in this time of postwar reconstruction, education comes first. The children of soldiers who died in the war have fulfilled their duty to the nation, and if they are orphaned and without support, they should be given preferential treatment with free education to nurture them and comfort the souls of the fallen. It is hereby stipulated that, from this year onwards, all levels of public schools nationwide, whether enrolling new students or transfer students, shall give priority to admission and enrollment for children of soldiers who died in the war who hold certificates and apply for examination. After admission, they may apply for free education in accordance with the regulations for free education for the children of war heroes. The application shall be submitted by the schools to the competent education administrative authorities for approval. The competent education administrative authorities at all levels should also allocate a special allowance within their respective financial budgets, in accordance with the regulations for free education for the children of war heroes, to facilitate the reimbursement of expenses. According to regulations, applications for free education for such expenses are limited to public schools. However, if the children of soldiers who died in the war voluntarily enroll in private schools and those private schools have free quotas, they may apply for priority. Please comply with these instructions and implement them accordingly." (Bai)</p>
<h3>Public Grain for Elementary School Teachers: All Converted to Cash Payments</h3>
<p>Executive Yuan Orders Ministry of Education to Comply</p>
<p>[Our newspaper report, Nanjing] Public grain for elementary school teachers was originally provided from 30% of the land tax collected in each county. After the victory in the War of Resistance, land taxes in various provinces were exempted, and the co-collection was simultaneously halted, severing the source of public grain for elementary school teachers. In view of this situation, the Ministry of Education submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for relief. Recently, an order was received that public grain for elementary school teachers should be converted to cash payments. The methods are as follows: (1) In provinces where land taxes have been exempted, the central government will allocate a subsidy equal to 30% of the county tax based on the original actual collection amount in each province, and the employees' salaries will be supplemented by the county government by incorporating the original public grain portion into the living allowance. (2) In provinces where land taxes have not been exempted, the county government will still co-collect 30% of the land tax, and the county government will sell the original in-kind items at the local market price and incorporate the proceeds into the living allowance.

<h3>Dr. Minsed Flies to Guangzhou to Discuss Merger with Lingnan University</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper report] Dr. Minsed, Executive Director of the United Board for Christian Colleges in China, is scheduled to fly to Guangzhou today to discuss merger plans with the Board of Directors of Lingnan University.

After returning to Shanghai, he will fly to Wuhan, Chongqing, and Chengdu to inspect the area and assemble joint plans for the universities. Then, he will return from Chengdu to Wuhan, and from Wuhan, he will fly to Beiping to deal with Yenching University.</p>
<p>Church University Merger Plan</p>
<p>Dr. Minsed went on to discuss the merger plan, stating: "According to the plan, with the exception of Shanghai, Nanjing, and Fuzhou, only one university will remain in each of the cities of Beiping, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Wuhan, and Chongqing. Each university will become a part of a 'United University,' and their departments will not duplicate each other. Research institutes will be established in Beiping, Shanghai, and Nanjing so that graduates can obtain doctoral degrees. According to the original plan, the four Christian universities in Shanghai will merge into one East China University."</p>
<p>Zhejiang University and Soochow University Accept Recommendations</p>
<p>Currently, Zhejiang University and Soochow University have accepted the merger recommendations. Shanghai University is not planning to participate for the time being, and St. John's University has not yet decided and is awaiting discussion by the board of directors. Dr. Minsed repeatedly emphasized that this plan is merely a suggestion, and the final decision to accept or reject it rests with the university authorities. However, in terms of saving manpower and resources and raising the standard of culture and scholarship, this merger plan is extremely valuable.</p>

<p>Teerpalka Changes His Name and Joins the Chinese Nationality; Will Go to Hong Kong to Join the Eastern Star Expedition Team</p>
<p>When the Hong Kong Eastern Star Football Team visited Shanghai for matches, there was enthusiastic publicity about their planned expedition to Australia.

Mr. Qu Yaokang, an enthusiast of sports, was entrusted to handle the procedures for Teerpalka to change his nationality to Chinese and rename himself Tan Degao.

<h3>Methods for Appointment, Dismissal, and Transfer of District and Bao Staff: District Offices May Not Alter Without Authorization</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of autonomous organizations at all levels, changes in personnel at district offices and Bao-Jia have been frequent, and personnel matters have been inconsistent. This is sufficient to affect the progress of autonomous undertakings. To establish the personnel foundation of autonomous organizations at all levels, the municipal government has specifically stipulated the following four methods for the appointment, dismissal, and transfer of district and Bao staff in the future:</p>
<p>(1) The transfer of personnel at all levels, whether it be removal, resignation, transfer, promotion, or demotion, must first be reported to the municipal government for approval. District offices may not alter without authorization. (2) The appointment of commissioned personnel must be approved before they can be appointed. They must not be dispatched and assigned to their posts by the district office in advance. (3) If there are mistakes made by staff at all levels and if there is no major error or illegal and corrupt activity, they may only be given reprimands or demerits as punishment. They should not be easily dismissed or transferred for minor offenses to stabilize their work. (4) If the staff of district offices and Bao cadres are unsuitable for the current environment, the district office may request their transfer. The above four items have been issued for compliance.</p>
<p>Another report: The municipal government has recently tended to emphasize academic qualifications and experience when appointing staff at all levels, often neglecting general physical conditions. As a result, those who are weak, sick, and elderly and unable to handle their duties may be fortunate enough to be appointed, which greatly affects work efficiency. Therefore, it has formulated ten methods for physical examinations of employees to select personnel. The above methods were sent out yesterday with an order for all agencies to comply.</p>

<h3>Dock Warehouse Congestion: Twenty Ships Berth Daily, Daily Losses Exceeding 100 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>"Reported by this newspaper" According to Liu Nianzhi, General Manager of China Wharf Company, recently, the various docks and warehouses in this city have seen some improvement in congestion due to the gradual clearance of large quantities of enemy and puppet goods, the continuous vacating of docks by the U.S. military, and the active promotion of dredging work by the Bureau of Hydraulic Engineering. However, the materials stockpiled by government and relief agencies remain considerable, often remaining untouched for months. The warehouse space is completely occupied. As a result, the goods carried by incoming ships cannot be unloaded upon arrival, resulting in an average of twenty ships being detained in the port each day. The detention time often reaches two weeks. On average, each ship spends 3,000 US dollars per day due to detention. Therefore, with twenty ships, the unnecessary loss reaches over 100 million legal tender per day. This loss, directly or indirectly, is passed on to the government and the people. Therefore, Mr. Liu suggests that in order to develop Shanghai's foreign trade and prosper Shanghai's port, the berthing and stacking of goods in dock warehouses should be fluid. The time should be short so that goods can flow smoothly. In terms of construction, efforts should be made to mechanize Shanghai's dock warehouses, using more machinery to replace manual labor. This can save labor costs and simplify work. Mr. Liu hopes that the government will quickly utilize or sell to various docks the machinery suitable for docks from the surplus materials of the U.S. military that it has acquired. It is estimated that the use of machinery can save at least five to ten times the current labor costs. Mr. Liu also mentioned the recent prevalence of theft in dock warehouses. It is reported that this large-scale theft is highly organized. When foreign ships arrive at the port, the crew often colludes with the stevedores to carry out theft in the hold. When lightering goods into the river, small sampans (commonly known as "water rats") gather and steal goods in batches. In addition, when goods are loaded and unloaded at the docks, there are many stevedores going in and out, making prevention even more difficult. Mr. Liu specifically pointed out that because these thefts are organized, the police bureau, water police, shipping companies, and the competent authorities of various dock warehouses should cooperate and discuss practical and effective prevention measures. Whether in the ship's hold or at the dock warehouse, supervisors should be dispatched to closely monitor when goods are loaded and unloaded. Reward and punishment rules should also be established to improve work efficiency.</p>
<h3>After the Price of White Rice Increased: North and South Markets Eagerly Receive Rice, Rice Shops Refuse to Sell Subsidized Brown Rice</h3>

The resolution on yesterday's white rice prices was in accordance with the prices agreed upon the day before. Since the meeting set the prices for various types of white rice the day before yesterday, transactions in the North and South rice markets have become active. The North market received 4,080 dan of rice, and the South market received 1,851 dan, totaling 5,921 dan. The retail price should not exceed 71,000 yuan.</p>
<p>[Another report] In order to take care of the rice needs of the general poor citizens, the municipal authorities planned to continue distributing 5,000 bags of brown rice each for the past two days, and hand them over to rice shops to sell at subsidized prices, but the rice shops refused to accept and sell them. Now the authorities have ordered several rice shops designated by the district offices to sell subsidized rice, which will be implemented in the coming days.</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Warehouse of the Ministry of Food has allocated 50,000 dan of rice to the municipal government. It is reported that the last batch of 500 tons was transported to the port by the China Merchants Bureau's Iron Barge No. 560 yesterday morning. After delivery, all 50,000 dan of rice were delivered.</p>
<p>[Another report] Of the 20 U.S. landing craft received by the China Merchants Bureau, five have been allocated to the Minsheng Company for takeover and are currently being refitted. According to Director Ye of the General Grain Warehouse, these landing craft are specifically for transporting rice, and each can load 200 to 300 tons of rice.</p>
<h3>Many Rumors in the Black Market: Public Bond Prices Surge Again</h3>
<p>The public bond market has rekindled. There were rumors in the market yesterday that the principal would be repaid in silver coins and that many brokerage companies were organizing, leading to a buying spree. With the encouragement of a few brokers, buyers participated enthusiastically. "Tong Bing" bonds rose from 800 yuan in the morning to 1,200 yuan, and then slightly stabilized. Two major players on the fifth and seventh floors covered their short positions. As a result, the closing price rose by 320 yuan compared to the previous day. Class A and B bonds rose by 200 yuan, Class D bonds rose by 290, and Class E bonds rose by 350 yuan alone.</p>
<h3>Active Coal Market Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the coal market saw increased purchases from customers after a long period of rain. Transactions among peers were also active. Due to the high cost of capital and long transportation times, it was still difficult for those who handled white coal screenings to obtain substantial profits. Therefore, arrivals were still low, and the market price suddenly rose sharply. The market prices for bituminous coal lumps and coal dust still diverged. Due to the shortage of lump coal and the severe loss of gangue, the asking price was high. The price of coal seam in Pudong, two-layer stack, was a new low of 145,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Crossing Out Promissory Notes and Bills of Exchange: No Legal Effect</h3>
<p>Recently Instructed by the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>If a check has parallel lines or special parallel lines (i.e., specifying a certain bank within the parallel lines), it can only be paid to money dealers or specified money dealers, as stipulated in Article 134 of the Negotiable Instruments Law. In other words, a crossed check can only be collected by a bank or money shop, and a specially crossed check can only be collected by the designated bank or money shop. Recently, according to custom, parallel lines and special parallel lines have also been added to promissory notes and bills of exchange, believing that the effect is the same as a check. However, this is not the case. The Joint Treasury has previously sent a letter to the Ministry of Finance for verification, which has now been received, stating: "According to civil law, matters not stipulated by law shall be governed by custom. Article 9 of the Negotiable Instruments Law has mandatory provisions: 'Matters not stipulated by the Negotiable Instruments Law recorded on a negotiable instrument shall not have the effect of a negotiable instrument.' Therefore, parallel lines drawn on promissory notes and bills of exchange shall not have the effect stipulated for checks in Article 134 of the Negotiable Instruments Law." This reply is based on the Interpretation No. 2830 of the Judicial Yuan.</p>
<h3>Few Buyers in the Yarn Market: Mosquito Netting Made of Raw Cotton is Very Popular</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market improved slightly. Customers from Tianjin and Guangdong remained inactive, but the Yangtze River Road and the Jingwu Railway Line took advantage of low prices to purchase yarn. Although the amount was not large, it added some color to the market. Sentiment among peers remained weak, and factories were willing to sell off, but there were few buyers, and the trend still showed no signs of significant recovery. At noon, the Textile Construction Company opened the yarn market as usual, with prices similar to the previous period, but 32-count Xiantao cone yarn was marked down by 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York's American cotton futures rose by 48 to 51 points per pound. The near-term price was 32.53, the far-term price was 32.79, and the Middling spot price was 33.22, all of which were unprecedented highs. The local raw cotton market remained stable, and transactions remained smooth. State-owned yarn mills such as Tongyi, Dufeng, Jiafeng, Xinsheng, and Qingchang all made purchases, and transactions among cotton dealers were also lively. Some cotton dealers exchanged yarn from Xinsheng Yarn Mill for Middling cotton at a rate of 11.5 dans per dan.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Applications for Brokers: Securities Exchange Actively Renovating</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Since the Shanghai Securities Market Preparatory Committee began processing broker applications on the 9th, it has issued more than 1,000 application forms as of yesterday, indicating widespread enthusiasm for applications. It is reported that the interior of the Securities Market has also been actively recruiting workers and contractors to build two separate markets for securities and bonds. The tenants on the second and third floors of the Securities Exchange Building have been asked to move to the vacant space vacated by Guanghua University on the eighth floor of the same building. At the same time, an agreement has been reached with the Shanghai Telephone Company to install 300 telephones in each market. However, all lines must be moved from the telephone line station in the Baxianqiao District of the company, so even if workers rush to install day and night, it will take at least four weeks. The complete renovation of the market will take at least one month.</p>
<h3>Flat Sales of Cotton Cloth</h3>
<p>The cloth market was unusually sluggish. Actual sales from customers were flat. In addition, the yarn market was trending downwards, causing the related cloth to be affected. Grey cloth and bleached cloth fell by 500 yuan to 750 yuan. Twill was stable, but colored balls were being sought in the North, rising by 1,000 yuan alone. Everything else remained in a soft position.</p>
<h3>No Improvement in Foreign Tea Market</h3>
<p>In the foreign tea market, the trading was difficult to conclude due to the price suppression of Chen Zhenmei by Xiehe Foreign Company, Xinhua, Wang Yutai, and others. However, various tea companies, considering the relatively suitable selling price of Wuyuan Chenchou Tribute tea, were quite happy to continue absorbing it. As for the new export teas that have been traded back and forth in recent days, the negotiations between the two sides still have a huge gap, and the situation has not improved. Although the Jiangbei and Tianjin gangs rarely purchase various domestic sales varieties, there are many additions from the Susong and local street shops, resulting in a stable market situation, with prices varying slightly depending on the quality of the goods.</p>
<h3>Re-establishment, Construction, Military Needs: Three Types of Government Bonds Drawn by Lottery Yesterday: Total Principal Repaid 10.22 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance held the lottery drawing for the repayment of principal for three types of government bonds, including Re-establishment, Construction, and Military Needs, at 9:00 AM yesterday at its Shanghai office. Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department, Ge Jiecun of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Mao Xikang of the Audit Department, Yang Samo of the Bankers Association, Xu Junqing of the Central Bank, Mei Shaocheng of the Bank of China, Zhang Yu of the Bank of Communications, Cao Boquan of the Money Dealers Association, and others attended. First, Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department, reported on the process of the lottery drawing for the repayment of principal for the three types of government bonds. The Re-establishment Government Bonds of 1936 (Republic Year 25) were being repaid for the 21st time, and 18 tickets were to be drawn, with the winning tickets totaling 6.12 million yuan. The second phase of the Construction Government Bonds of 1939 (Republic Year 28) were being repaid for the 10th time, and 7 tickets were to be drawn, with the winning tickets totaling 2.1 million yuan. The first phase of the Military Needs Government Bonds of 1941 (Republic Year 30) were being repaid for the 7th time, and 5 tickets were to be drawn, with the winning tickets totaling 2 million yuan. The supervisors were then invited to inspect the ticket tubes, number tickets, and ticket ledgers. The lottery drawers then performed the lottery drawing. The winning numbers were: Re-establishment Government Bonds: 009, 063, 154, 260, 296, 317, 328, 401, 458, 577, 588, 688, 692, 738, 846, 898, 927, 942; second phase of the Construction Government Bonds: 077, 203, 351, 439, 556, 751, 962; first phase of the Military Needs Government Bonds: 119, 387, 698, 854, 901.</p>
<p>Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department, also told reporters that the payment deadline for the repayment of principal and matured interest coupons for various government bonds was originally set at three years. In order to protect the rights and interests of bondholders in the occupied and remote areas during the eight-year war of resistance, the government has specifically stipulated that from July 1 of this year to the end of this year, all outstanding repayments of principal and matured interest coupons for various government bonds can still be collected from the Four Banks and Two Bureaus or their agent treasuries.</p>
<h3>Need to Settle Import Goods: U.S. Dollars and Hong Kong Notes Surge Again: Gold Prices Rise to Over 30,000</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign exchange remained stable. It opened high in the morning due to the rumor of coinage, but securities firms selling gold to exchange for shares caused it to fall from around 1.94 million. The Central Bank allocated 140 bars at a price of 1.925 million, which was similar to the market price at the time. After that, it fluctuated between 1.92 million and 1.93 million. In the afternoon, a large amount of buying came from U.S. dollars, pushing it back up to around 1.95 million. As a result, the closing price rose by over 30,000 compared to the previous day. Ornamental gold was 10,800, silver was 1,800, the underground money market eased again, and interest rates were about 1.5 to 1.8 corners.</p>
<p>The U.S. dollar was quite stable. It opened flat in the morning and remained very stable after opening. Settlement was more active. Although it retreated from 2,480 yuan to 2,440 yuan, it was only temporary. Soon it gradually rose, hovering around 2,480 yuan at noon. With ships arriving one after another, settlement was even more active. In the afternoon, it approached the 2,600 yuan level again before leveling off slightly. As a result, the closing price rose by 180 compared to the previous day. Hedging squeezed closer to 756 yuan per 10 taels. The Hong Kong note market actually exceeded the telegraphic transfer price in the afternoon, surging by 20 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate rose along with the note market to 540 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 650 yuan, the British exchange rate was 8,600, and the U.S. exchange rate remained flat.</p>
<h3>White and Brown Sugar Both Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market softened again due to a wait-and-see attitude towards actual sales. The association's marked price for No. 20 medium-grade white sugar was initially 100,450 yuan, then 4,500 yuan, then 4,000 yuan, and finally 2,000 yuan, a drop of 45,000 yuan. Stacking orders available today are 98,000 yuan. Raw brown sugar was slightly tighter due to a shortage of goods, at 100,200 yuan. Green sugar was increasingly weak due to oversupply. The Chao Gang opened dozens of bags of Huanggang green sugar at a price of 81,200 yuan, another drop of 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The sixth phase of the Taiwan Sugar Company's auction is scheduled to be held tomorrow. The selling price is under consideration. In three or four days, the "Hai Gui Wheel" will arrive in Shanghai from Taiwan, bringing a large batch of Taiwan sugar.</p>
<h3>Food Company</h3>
<p>Must First Go Through Company Procedures, Then Obtain Food Department License</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Ministry of Food recently stipulated that all food firms organized as companies must first go through the registration procedures in accordance with the Company Law and obtain the registration documents from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Then, they must submit these documents along with the company's articles of association, business plan, list of directors and supervisors, and food merchant registration form to the Ministry of Food for issuance of a food merchant license before they are allowed to operate. It is reported that this has been communicated to all provinces and cities for compliance.</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Money Discovered in Various Places</h3>
<p>Recently, it has been discovered in various places along the Jinghu and Huhang lines that the Central Bank's 50-yuan notes printed by Delarue Company in 1941 (Republic Year 30) have been altered to 500 yuan. These altered notes involve pasting another piece of paper over the original "50" characters to change them to "500". Also, counterfeit banknotes of the Central Bank's blue 2,000-yuan version have been discovered. These counterfeit notes are exquisitely printed, and it is difficult to distinguish the paper quality and printing ink from the real ones. Only through close comparison can they be identified as counterfeit. The differences are that the lines of the portrait of Sun Yat-sen on the front are uneven in thickness, and the ink color is slightly blurred. The five characters "Central Printing Factory" printed on the lower center edge are blurred, especially the three characters "Printing Factory", which are quite unclear due to the many strokes. The pen strokes of the director's signature on the back are also slightly thicker than those of the genuine banknotes. The Ministry of Finance has already issued notices to the provincial and municipal governments based on reports from various parties, ordering their subordinates to pay attention to the investigation and prosecution in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Hot Trading Concentrated in Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>But High Prices Could Not Be Sustained, Resulting in Slight Gains</p>
<p>Chinese stocks were stimulated by rumors when the market opened yesterday morning, appearing to be hot. The financial strength of the industry was limited, so they could only concentrate their efforts on the most popular stocks, leaving them with no time to attend to the less popular ones. There were sellers, and small stocks soon fell back down. High prices for large stocks were also difficult to sustain, but they were still seeing-sawing at noon. Small stocks all saw lower prices. When they were most popular in the middle of the day, Yongshen was as high as 473 yuan, Maya was 2,900 yuan, Jingfu was 195 yuan, Xinguang was 220 yuan, and Qinxing was 173 yuan. By noon, the results were that Yongshen and Maya had risen slightly, while Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing had all fallen by more than half a percent. Small and medium-sized cold stocks continued to decline slightly. Selling pressure on old stocks was high, making them difficult to sell off, and the decline was greater.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the major popular stocks in the foreign stock market were unable to rise, remaining relatively flat. Smaller stocks varied according to supply and demand, with some still being liquidated in large quantities, showing more declines than gains. The overall trend fluctuated, but by noon, Yishen and British Union were flat compared to the previous day, while Huide, Sichuan Yibei, and others rose slightly. Paper industry, steel industry, Asian industry, and Guangzhou industry all fell slightly.</p>
<h3>Yellow and White Printing Paper Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Product of Taiwan Paper Company</p>
<p>The Zhaoshang Bureau's Hai Chen Wheel, carrying white and yellow printing paper from Taiwan, unloaded its cargo in Pudong yesterday morning. This printing paper is a product of the Taiwan Paper Company. The company uses its own forests to make pulp and paper, making it the largest paper-making institution in the country. It is reported that part of this shipment will be transshipped to various ports in the interior, with only a small amount being supplied to local manufacturers in Shanghai. It is expected that it will be regularly shipped to Shanghai in the future.</p>
<h3>U.S. Gold Reserves Total Over 20 Billion U.S. Dollars</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] It has been reported that U.S. gold reserves, which sharply decreased during the war, are now gradually increasing again. According to the Treasury Department, the current U.S. gold reserves are valued at approximately $20,270,000,000. The highest record in the past was October 1941, when gold reserves reached a value of $22,799,700,000.</p>
<h3>U.S. Spice Market: Chinese Goods Rank First</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 10th] According to the American Spice Trade Association: Recently, seven sources of spices, the markets of which have been reopened, have been counted. The most important of these should be China. Normally, the amount of spices China exports to the United States is second only to India and the Dutch East Indies. The seven reopened source countries are listed below: China...cinnamon, fennel, cassia; Argentina...poppy seeds; Haiti...Tonka beans; Cyprus...aniseed, fennel, cassia; Greece...basil, mint, cassia; Yugoslavia...pepper, basil; Sweden...mustard, poppy.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Grains: Flour was firm in the morning but weak in the afternoon. Shandong wheat was slightly inquired about, but the rate of consumption was still slow. Yellow beans were high in price, then weakened. The soybean cake market was flat and weak. Oil prices remained lackluster. Bran continued to decline by 200 yuan.</p>
<p>Hardware: A large batch of grinding wheels ordered by Tongyi Foreign Company before the war has arrived. At the same time, a large number of Ace Brand files from Asia Steel Plate Foreign Company have also arrived. Prices will remain unchanged for the time being. It is reported that those who own the goods want to sell them off at low prices due to tight credit conditions.</p>
<p>Tung Oil: [United Press, Washington, 9th] It was learned here today that China is gradually restoring its position as a tung oil exporting country. In the first three months of this year, 1.5 million pounds of tung oil were shipped to the United States. However, due to transportation difficulties, it is difficult to see an increase for the time being.</p>
<p>Dried Lily Flowers: Recently, dried lily flowers have been arriving one after another, but sales have been very slow. In addition, the new goods are softer in quality and cannot be stored for long. The only option is to sell them off cheaply, which has led to repeated price declines. Dozens of bags were traded in the market yesterday, falling another 30% or so. The total decline has reached 40%, indicating that the weakness has reached an extreme point.</p>
<p>Diesel: China Oil Factory's diesel exports amounted to 3,800 tons last month, worth US$3 million. 90% was shipped to the United States, and the remaining 10% was shipped to the Soviet Union. It is generally speculated that this month will decrease to around 1,500 tons due to transportation disruptions in the production areas.</p>

<h3>Commemorating Lugou Bridge</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Zhang Jianmei, Beiping Correspondence, July 5th</p>
<p>Nine Years Have Passed, Yet the Scars Remain Fresh</p>
<p>On July 2nd, several colleagues from Beiping visited Lugou Bridge with the reverence one might have for a hallowed site of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Lugou Bridge is located thirty *li* southwest of Beiping, connected closely by a smooth asphalt road built by the Japanese. After passing through Zhangyi Gate and undergoing an inspection, our car headed west. Apart from the yellow blockhouses scattered like stars outside of arrow range, the highway exuded an atmosphere of bustling peace. Farmers' large carts transporting grain and vendors carrying gourds and fruits plodded north, supplying Beiping with sustenance. The wheat on both sides had already been harvested, but due to lack of rain, autumn crops had not yet been planted, leaving most of the land bare.</p>
<p>In less than half an hour, we had reached Wanping territory. This city was truly the starting point of the war. On July 6th, nine years prior, the Mutaguchi Regiment wanted to pass through the city to conduct exercises south of the Yongnan River. The defending national army refused them passage. Using the excuse that two soldiers were missing during exercises on the other side of the Yongding River on July 5th, they insisted on entering the city to search, but were still refused by the defending army. The next day at dawn, the Mutaguchi Regiment launched the July 7th Incident, which shook the world. Although nine years have passed, the scars inflicted on Wanping by the invaders remain fresh. The city walls on both sides of the north gate were riddled with bullet holes, and the Japanese later filled the damaged areas with new bricks. However, the new bricks, juxtaposed against the dark, ancient city walls, fully displayed the trauma and discord. Wanping City was originally small, with a diameter of only one *li* from north to south. The houses within the city, destroyed by shelling nine years ago, have not been repaired to this day, leaving ruins of broken tiles, collapsed walls, shattered bricks, and rotten wood everywhere. Giant weeds grow on the ground, and eagles and crows circle in the sky. Besides the garrison, few people remain in the city. The Wanping County government, perhaps unable to endure the loneliness of the desolate city or unable to supply the passing troops, simply moved to Xindian. Now, only the Lugou Bridge Township Office remains in the city.</p>
<p>One of the Ten Scenic Spots of the Northern Kingdom: Lugou at Dawn</p>
<p>Lugou Bridge, visited by Marco Polo, is located less than a hundred meters from the south gate of Wanping. It is a stone bridge about forty meters long and three meters wide, majestically spanning the vast, yellow Yongding River. Construction began in the twenty-ninth year of the Dading reign of the Jin Dynasty and lasted four years, making it exquisitely built. Each balustrade is carved with a lion about a foot tall, with many small lions squatting at the feet of each large lion. A melon vendor on the bridge said, "The number of large lions is known, but the number of small lions is unknown." In the seven hundred and fifty-seven years since, dynastic changes, wars, and wind and rain seem not to have inflicted much damage. Only three of the hundreds of small lions have had parts of their heads chipped off.</p>
<p>At the northern end of the bridge stands a stele inscribed with "Lugou at Dawn," said to be one of the ten scenic spots of Beijing. Presumably, watching the setting dawn moon over the Yongding River from the bridge is uniquely charming, but unfortunately, we arrived too late. Directly across from Lugou Bridge is the Pinghan Railway Bridge to the west, a long and beautiful black iron bridge over one hundred and fifty meters long, also spanning the Yongding River. It is modern enough, but we still prefer the ancient Lugou Bridge, not just because of the beauty of "Lugou at Dawn" and the nostalgic sentiments evoked by the sound of camel bells crossing the bridge, but because it is the starting point of our great War of Resistance. When the Pinghan Railway's Yongding River Bridge was taken after the July 7th Incident, this ancient bridge remained impregnable in the hands of our 29th Army brothers wielding broadswords, until the national army withdrew from Beiping on July 30th, when the troops guarding the bridge automatically retreated.</p>
<p>The Once-Illustrious Monument, Now Trapped in the Mud</p>
<p>The Japanese army fired the first shot at our army from the Yiwenzishan hills west of Wanping City. Therefore, the Japanese also considered this place to be the "birthplace" of their invasion of China. In a field of gravel, besides a few white, dilapidated houses with missing doors and windows, the reporter could find almost nothing. Finally, on a small earthen hill, we found the pitiful monument, pushed over and lying awkwardly on the hillside. The monument was made of white stone, with the main text:</p>
<p>"Yiwenzishan, the Place Where the China Incident Began." The other side stated: "July 8th, Showa 12 [1937]. Mutaguchi Unit from the 29th to the 2nd, Battlefield Fierce Battle with Noguchi Cavalry Unit on the 28th. Merit" (indicating that this was the battlefield of the Mutaguchi Regiment and the Noguchi Cavalry Unit). The four sides of the base of the monument were also engraved with the words "First Anniversary of the Outbreak of the China Incident, Day, Square, Beijing Residents' Association." and described the construction process: "Because the characters on the two sides of the stele were written by Mr. Hachi, two wooden markers were placed at this location, written by the Mutaguchi Unit Commander. Copied and engraved." (indicating that the characters on the monument were engraved based on the handwriting on the wooden signs of the Mutaguchi Unit Commander). Finally, the date of the monument's erection was noted: "July 7th, Showa 13 [1938], North China Branch of the Imperial Veterans Association." Perhaps those people from the Mutaguchi Regiment and the Noguchi Cavalry Unit have become cannon fodder or war criminals today. The once-illustrious "monument" has also been pushed over and lies prostrate in the mud.</p>
<p>A General from Xuzhou Selects a Burial Place for Loyal Bones</p>
<p>On the other hand, General He Jifeng, the commander of the 119th Brigade who led the Lugou Bridge garrison during the July 7th Incident—now the Deputy Commander of the Third Pacification Zone in the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters—walked among the hills of Yiwenzishan with Huang Rencai, the Special Commissioner of the Fifth District of Hebei, in the capacity of a victor, to commemorate this battlefield. General He had just flown in from Xuzhou. His main task this time was to find a final resting place on Yiwenzishan for General Zhao Dengyu, who died in the Battle of Nanyuan nine years ago. General Zhao's remains are currently temporarily placed in a temple in Beiping. General He and some old friends have petitioned for a state funeral for General Zhao.</p>
<h3>Acting as a Bridge Between the US and the Soviet Union: Establishing a Century-Long Plan for World Peace—On the International Situation and Diplomatic Policy—</h3>
<p>— Chu Yukun</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Under the current international circumstances, "All Under Heaven Are One Family" is still an ideal, and there is still a considerable distance from its realization. Therefore, any country or nation that wishes to survive in this world must have the power to defend itself. As everyone knows, there are two types of power that protect a country's survival: one is tangible military force, which is the country's military strength; the other is intangible intelligence, which is the country's diplomacy. In times of war, it is of course necessary to rely on strong military equipment to fight for victory on the battlefield. However, relying solely on force and failing to use intelligence, with diplomacy as a precursor to military action, is not enough to ensure survival. The result of this world war, in which the militaristic Germany and Japan were utterly defeated, is a good example. Conversely, if military and diplomacy can be equally emphasized, with diplomacy as the vanguard of military action on the one hand, and military strength as the backing of diplomacy on the other, then success is assured. In this war, although Britain's military strength was not as great as that of Nazi Germany, it was able to turn defeat into victory, which can be said to be entirely due to Churchill's diplomatic success.</p>
<p>As for peacetime, both military preparedness and diplomacy are matters of utmost concern to all countries. The United States, for example, not only wants to keep the secret of atomic energy, but also wants to extend the conscription law, so that its army, navy, and air force maintain wartime levels. Recently, the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps conducted atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll to determine the power of atomic bombs against the navy. At the same time, the United States is making various diplomatic offensives, not only to make the United Nations a unique and effective tool for maintaining world peace, but also to launch various international conferences and propose international treaties to stabilize the post-war world and prevent it from being threatened by war. Why does the United States do this? To put it in broader terms, this is what the United States must do for international peace and world security; to put it in narrower terms, this is for the sake of its own security and prosperity. Because no American does not believe that "if other countries in the world are destroyed by war or internal strife, or threatened by famine, poverty, and disease, then the United States cannot enjoy peace and prosperity within its own borders."</p>
<p>As for the Soviet Union, it is a socialist country, and both in thought and in theory, it forms a separate system, completely different from the capitalist countries of Britain and the United States. Having suffered painful lessons in this war, it has to pay special attention to the two forces that protect its own survival. Therefore, in the post-war Soviet Union, in addition to burying itself in material construction and strengthening the power of the armed forces, it is also committed to diplomacy, wanting to make its surrounding neighbors its "safe zone."</p>
<p>Therefore, in peacetime international relations, both "military competition" and the diplomatic war of "seeking security" are unavoidable.</p>
<p>Looking back at our country, we have always regarded "World Harmony" as our ideal and collective security as our means. However, estimating the power to protect our country's survival is chilling. First, in terms of military preparedness: today's world has entered the atomic age, but our industrialization period has not yet matured. Since industry cannot be industrialized, the so-called military preparedness has no foundation. Whether it is the army, navy, or air force, we are lagging behind and cannot catch up. It is obviously insufficient to protect our own survival by force. Secondly, in terms of diplomacy, China's post-war diplomacy is again hovering on the divergent paths of Washington and Moscow. In addition, our own strength is insufficient, and relying on collective security and the United Nations is reliable but not for long. Therefore, today's China, whether in terms of military preparation or diplomacy, is not enough to protect its own survival. Therefore, we must raise our vigilance, pay attention to the evolution of the international situation at all times, and re-examine our country's established diplomatic policy.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Our country fought a hard-fought war of resistance for eight years. Although the material conditions were not as good as those of the enemy, we finally won. This cannot but be said to be the success of our country's diplomacy. Because when our country launched a full-scale war of resistance, the international situation was not entirely favorable to our country, but our country's highest authorities, having insight into the domestic and international situation, resolutely decided on five principles:</p>
<p>(1) To maintain the spirit of independence and autonomy, unite with countries and nations in the world that sympathize with our country, and strive for world peace and justice.</p>
<p>(2) To do our best to maintain international peace organizations and conventions that guarantee international peace, and to strengthen their authority.</p>
<p>(3) To unite all forces that oppose Japanese imperialist aggression, to stop Japanese aggression, and to establish and guarantee the permanent peace of East Asia.</p>
<p>(4) To further enhance the existing friendship with all countries in the world in order to expand sympathy for our country.</p>
<p>(5) To deny and cancel all puppet organizations created by Japan by force in Chinese territory, and their internal and external activities.</p>
<p>During these seven or eight years, the international situation has changed dramatically. Sometimes it was favorable to our country's war of resistance, and sometimes it was unfavorable to our country's war of resistance. However, our country's diplomatic authorities, under the highest leader, have always adhered to this established diplomatic policy, that is, the so-called "using the immutable to deal with the ever-changing," and finally turned the international situation that was unfavorable to us into a situation that was favorable to us. Unlike the Japanese invaders' diplomacy, which was indecisive and often made mistakes, sometimes even "getting slapped on both sides of the face," making one mistake after another and falling into an irreparable predicament.</p>
<p>Over the past seven or eight years, our country's diplomatic measures have been countless, which cannot be described in detail in this article. However, to sum it up, in a nutshell, diplomacy during the War of Resistance was a complete success. Not only were all the measures appropriate, but also our country's ideal of "seeking self-reliance internally and seeking coexistence externally" was fully achieved.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>The War of Resistance has ended in victory, and the international situation has also undergone unprecedented changes. Because the common enemies of the United Nations have been defeated. As a result, there is no common goal among the United Nations, and the conflicts of interest between each other have instead caused various contradictions. They could cooperate fully during the war, but now they cannot cooperate; they could tolerate each other during the war, but after the war they suspect each other. Thus, a rift has developed among the United Nations. All this is very obvious. Therefore, in Europe, repeated meetings of foreign ministers have been convened, but these problems cannot be solved. It was not until today that it was decided to convene a 21-nation peace conference on July 29th; and its future is difficult to be optimistic about. The same is true in the Far East. If the deadlock in Europe cannot be broken, the problems in the Far East cannot be solved alone.</p>
<p>Under this kind of international situation, what kind of diplomatic policy should our country adopt? In principle, it is to take "World Harmony" as the highest ideal and to take the United Nations, which supports collective security, as a means. However, whether adopting this means can achieve this goal is not a question under the current international environment.</p>
<p>As pointed out above, the post-war international situation is still in a state of turbulence. Whether in Europe or in the Far East, there is a tendency to "divide" but no phenomenon of "uniting." Why? The main factor is that the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union is getting farther and farther apart, more and more estranged, and even standing in opposition everywhere, like ice and charcoal, which are incompatible. Caught in the cracks of the contradictions between the United States and the Soviet Union, our country's diplomatic path has become narrower. At the same time, the ideal of "All Under Heaven Are One Family" is even less likely to be realized.</p>
<p>In the current stage of US-Soviet relations, the points of divergence between the US and the Soviet Union are very obvious. From the US point of view, it wants to maintain world peace and support the collective security system; but how can the United Nations be effective? It believes that it must have strength as its backing, so it insists on keeping the secret of atomic energy, which cannot be made public until the Soviet Union explains its territorial demands for Europe and the Far East, and then atomic energy can be handed over to international control. As for the Soviet Union, it believes that the United States' keeping the secret of atomic energy is intended to threaten it. Therefore, it feels that its own security is not guaranteed and has to haggle over its "safe zone." At the same time, for the United Nations, because the Soviet Union is too high and few agree with it, it has to use the minority to control the majority and insist that the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council should have the right to exercise the "veto." In the past ten months, the Soviet Union has used this privilege everywhere, making the United States helpless. Therefore, the United States is now developing a strong international movement that advocates that there should be no veto in any international conference. Otherwise, the United Nations cannot become an effective tool for maintaining world peace.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that today's world is still at a crossroads between war and peace. What kind of policy should our country adopt? It is indeed a question worth studying. In December of this year, the Political Consultative Conference also discussed future diplomatic policy. All parties and non-partisans unanimously agreed on four principles:</p>
<p>(1) To abide by the Atlantic Charter, the Cairo Declaration, the Moscow Four-Nation Declaration, and the United Nations Charter, and actively participate in the United Nations organization to ensure world peace.</p>
<p>(2) To liquidate Japan's remaining forces in China based on the Potsdam Declaration, and to cooperate with the Allies to protect the solution of the Japanese problem and prevent the resurgence of Japanese fascist militarist forces in order to ensure the security of East Asia.</p>
<p>(3) To maintain friendly relations with the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and other democratic countries, to abide by treaties and good faith, and to strive for economic and cultural cooperation in order to jointly promote world prosperity and progress.</p>
<p>(4) To quickly conclude commercial treaties with relevant countries based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and to improve the status of overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>These four principles are not new, and our diplomatic authorities have already been working according to these principles. The problem now is how to implement them in the current complex international environment in order to achieve the goals of our country's diplomatic policy. We would like to offer the following suggestions for the reference of our diplomatic authorities.</p>
<p>First, we should recognize that under the current international environment, the idea of "All Under Heaven Are One Family" is still an ideal that cannot be realized for the time being. We must not be dependent and only want to rely on the United Nations to protect our security. Instead, we should "rely on our own efforts" and use our own military and intelligence to protect the country's survival. That is to say, in addition to burying ourselves in national construction, strengthening national defense, and increasing military preparedness, we must also use our intelligence to launch an independent diplomatic offensive. We should not be bound by idealism and remain unchanged, nor should we always take realism as our starting point, only knowing what is beneficial and not knowing what is just. For any international event, we must take the interests of the country and the nation as the premise. The people of the whole country may have differences of opinion on domestic affairs, but on diplomacy, they should have a common position and unified steps.</p>
<p>Second, China needs peace and needs to devote itself to the great cause of national construction and revival in a peaceful atmosphere. Therefore, we hope that all countries in the world can "unite" rather than "divide." Only a "united" international situation is beneficial to China. Especially for the United States and the Soviet Union, we cannot mix any emotional or emotional factors, but should treat them equally, without distinction. The Kuomintang needs the friendship of the Soviet Union, and the Communist Party also needs the goodwill of the United States. Anyone who advocates anti-American or anti-Soviet sentiment is detrimental to China. Moreover, we can go further and act as a bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union, promote understanding between the two countries, resolve suspicions and reconcile, and work together to establish a century-long plan for world peace. For example, US Secretary of State Byrnes recently advocated that in Europe, the UK, the US, the Soviet Union, and France should sign a 25-year treaty to disarm Germany, and in the Far East, he also proposed a 25-year treaty to disarm Japan to China, the UK, and the Soviet Union to prevent the resurgence of the power of Germany and Japan. The Soviet Union seems to be very cold about this. Our diplomatic authorities should make great efforts between the United States and the Soviet Union to bring them together so that these two treaties can be established at the same time, so as to establish two solid cornerstones for European peace and Far East security.</p>
<h3>A Major Artery Connecting North and South: The Canton-Hankow Railway is Revived!</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Guangzhou, Correspondent Ran Feng, 2nd</p>
<p>The Canton-Hankow Railway – this major artery traversing the three provinces of Hubei, Hunan, and Guangdong, connecting North and South – ever since Chairman Chiang ordered its complete repair and reopening by the end of June this year, the Railway Bureau, in order to fulfill this mission, has had all its employees working day and night, exerting themselves to the utmost to accelerate the repairs, and mobilized hundreds of thousands of civilians along the route. Starting work in January of this year, they have completed the task in just six months, despite extreme difficulties in manpower, materials, and finances; now, the entire line has been reopened.</p>
<p>Joyful Music, Train Starts</p>
<p>The grand ceremony for the full reopening of the Canton-Hankow Railway was held as scheduled on July 1st. On that day, eastern Guangzhou (formerly the Dashatou Station, now the Huangsha section renamed Guangzhou South Station) was decorated in a completely new fashion. Thousands of leaders and guests from all walks of life who came to participate in the grand ceremony crowded the station, almost blocking it entirely, all displaying expressions of boundless excitement and joy. At 4:00 PM, the ceremony began. Director Zhen Yuan of the Railway Bureau could not come to Guangzhou to participate due to other business. He had already sent a telegram commending all employees for their hard work in completing the reopening task, so the ceremony that day was presided over by Deputy Director Li Huixiang. Mr. Li gave a detailed report on the brief history of the railway's construction and the process of rushing the repairs this time as ordered. Following speeches by Chairman Luo of the Provincial Government, Director Huang Shuzhong of the Xingying Transportation Department, and others, the attendees successively stepped out onto the platform and walked to the front of the Guangzhou-Wuchang train composed of eight carriages. Amid the joyful music, Miss Qiongying, daughter of Mayor Chen, cut the ribbon, the engine started, and the train, carrying the first batch of 319 passengers, amidst the sounds of firecrackers and music, with a blast of the whistle, slowly headed straight towards Wuchang North, at 5:30 PM. It is expected to arrive in Wuchang in 68 hours.</p>
<p>After the meeting, the reporter interviewed Deputy Director Li Yaoxiang, Deputy Chief of Transportation Section Wen Bochang, and others, and learned from them the detailed process of this repair and reopening, and the many difficult and huge engineering aspects of the railway.</p>
<p>First Seek Reopening, Then Strive for Completion</p>
<p>The entire length of the Canton-Hankow Railway is 1,096 kilometers, with a total of 50 bridges, including the Yingde Bridge and the Qujiang Bridge; and 17 tunnels such as Gaolian Village, Fuyanshui, and Qimen. During the fall of the entire line, all were separately destroyed. All the large bridges and steel beams were completely blown up beyond repair. The tunnels were also filled with trucks loaded with iron ore and then detonated, so the repair of these bridges and tunnels naturally required considerable and extensive engineering. For example, the bridge piers of the Qujiang Railway Bridge were blown up to a depth of one meter. Construction took place during the rainy season on this turbulent Binjiang River, and the difficulty can be imagined. Also, such as the Gaolian Village north of Shaoguan and the mountain cave more than 300 meters long in Changsha, because they were completely destroyed, formal repairs were really not easy. Moreover, current transportation is obstructed, funds are not easily supplied, and construction materials are lacking. Now, only everything is being done in a simple and crude manner. Where bridges cannot be repaired, temporary bridges are temporarily built. Tunnels are bypassed by adding temporary lines. As for sleepers, almost all of them are taken from fir trees near the road. However, the foundations of these bridges are unstable, and if mountain floods break out, there is a risk of being washed away. After the steel beams from overseas are rushed to the site, the main bridges will be built to ensure permanent stability. At the same time, due to the loss of many railway tracks, some of them are now being transferred from the Xiang-Gui, Qian-Gui, and other lines. In the future, when the materials arrive, they will still need to be replaced.</p>
<p>Passengers First, Freight to Wait</p>
<p>Under the principle of "First Seek Reopening, Then Strive for Completion," the entire line has been reopened; but due to a lack of materials and imperfect equipment, it can only focus on passenger transport for the time being, and freight transport will have to wait for a while. Currently, in addition to two direct trains between Guangzhou and Wuchang per week, a material train runs daily from Kowloon to Hengyang. The Guangzhou to Shaoguan, Shaoguan to Hengyang, Hengyang to Changsha, and Changsha to Wuchang sections also have shuttle trains operating daily. The Guangzhou-Wuchang direct special express train departs every Monday and Thursday. The upward train departs from Guangzhou at 7:30 PM, and the downward train departs from Xujiapeng, Wuchang. Fares have been adjusted by order: 27,650 yuan for third class, double for second class, and the sum of second and third class fares for first class, which is 82,950 yuan. The sleeper ticket price is: 8,000 yuan national currency per night for the upper berth of first class, and 10,000 yuan per night for the lower berth. Originally, the entire journey from Guangzhou to Wuchang by direct train was expected to take 68 hours, but recently, incessant rainy weather has affected the journey, and it may be extended to 80 or 90 hours, because the newly built track in the Guangzhou-Shaoguan section has too loose a foundation, and can only travel 15 kilometers per hour. The Shaoguan-Wuchang section and below can travel faster, about 25 kilometers per hour. Calculated at an average speed of 20 kilometers per hour, the journey will take four days!</p>
<p>Return to Former Glory Within Half a Year</p>
<p>Locomotives are what the Railway Bureau currently lacks the most. According to the bureau's estimate, the entire line needs 376 locomotives, 390 combined passenger cars, 1,540 passenger cars, and 35 freight cars to meet transportation needs. But what they have now, pieced together and repaired from remnants, is only 80 locomotives, 48 combined passenger cars, and 141 passenger cars, so the transportation capacity is limited after the reopening, and it is inevitable that it cannot meet social needs; however, according to Deputy Director Li, if various transportation materials can be supplied steadily, then in half a year, the Canton-Hankow Railway can naturally fully restore to its pre-war state!</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Civil Servants' Bitter Lives? Many Protests</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Hangzhou, Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>After the adjustment of salaries for civil servants in Zhejiang Province, the base salary is 55,000 yuan, with a multiple of 240, which is different from the base salary of 15,000 yuan and a multiple of 140 in Beijing and Shanghai. After learning of the salary adjustment, the civil servants expressed their dissatisfaction, arguing that the price level in Hangzhou is quite high and no less than that in Beijing and Shanghai. The provincial government decided to report the actual living conditions in Zhejiang to the central government and at the same time persuade the civil servants to work hard for the public. The details of the situation are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>During these eight or nine years of the War of Resistance, the civil servants moved three times with the Zhejiang government, from Hangzhou to Jinhua, from Jinhua to Fangyan, from Fangyan to Yunhe. At that time, there were pursuers behind them, and the future was uncertain, but they had a common belief, which was "Victory in the War of Resistance is certain!" Supporting the old and carrying the young, they disregarded all sacrifices and traveled all over the mountains and ridges, reaching the edge of Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Victory finally came, and they returned to Hangzhou from the edge of Zhejiang, supporting the old and carrying the young. They could finally see the charming West Lake again. Although the salaries were meager, they thought that this could be reasonably resolved and that this temporary phenomenon was unavoidable. The cost of living increased, and everything rose in price. Only the civil servants suffered, their salaries did not increase, and they only expected prices to stabilize and salaries to improve.</p>
<h3>A Declaration Like a Thunderbolt, Demanding Reasonable New Treatment</h3>
<p>As expected, the salaries of civil servants in the Executive Yuan were finally adjusted. Hangzhou, which is adjacent to Shanghai and close to Nanjing, has a base salary of 55,000 yuan and a salary multiple of 250, so a civil servant with a base salary of 100 yuan only gets 79,100 yuan in total, an increase of 19,000 yuan. We observe that the cost of living here is similar to that of Shanghai, or even higher than that of Nanjing, and civil servants who live on salaries, to be honest, find it difficult to maintain a living.</p>
<p>After civil servants in Hangzhou learned of the salary adjustment, their sorrow turned into a common idea, which was to demand reasonable treatment. All agencies in the provincial capital received an "Emergency Declaration of Civil Servants," the main contents of which were: (1) We demand reasonable and equal treatment to solve the minimum living standards. (2) We oppose this unreasonable adjustment - subsidy multiple. (3) We support the salary adjustment plan proposed by the Legislative Yuan last time - a living allowance of 200,000 yuan, multiplied by 1,000 times. (4) We decided to hold a general meeting of all public school teachers and staff on June 7th at 4:00 PM in the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce and take leave of absence to attend. Under this thunderbolt-like call, the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce was packed with public school teachers and staff in the afternoon, a total of 1,500 to 1,600 people. Some made impassioned speeches, some were so excited that their throats were hoarse, some proposed a general strike, some proposed a general resignation, and some proposed a general leave of absence.</p>
<h3>Adjustment is Not a Good Policy, Seek a Thorough Solution</h3>
<p>After the provincial government received this news, the heads of various provincial-level agencies separately persuaded and comforted them, but the general leave of absence on the 8th was finally implemented. The heads of the provincial-level agencies have urgently telegraphed Chairman Shen in Nanjing for instructions. It is said that Chairman Shen is also arguing reasonably in Nanjing. It is expected that there will be a solution soon.</p>
<p>But what if the salary adjustment is really adjusted according to the opinions of the civil servants in Zhejiang Province? "Prices" are a very cunning and man-eating tiger, and it will still wave its claws at the public school teachers and staff. It may even be laughing secretly, saying that you can't escape my grasp! Therefore, we must pay attention to the reasons for rising prices, whether it is due to a shortage of goods and a large population. Regarding this, the reporter consulted with an authoritative expert in economics, who said that according to the population of Hangzhou and the products of Hangzhou, it should definitely not rise so much. I am afraid that the same is true in Beijing and Shanghai. Since it is not a natural reason, there must be artificial reasons. If this artificial factor is not eradicated, how long will we salary-earning civil servants suffer?</p>
<p>We clearly see the government saying, "Sufficient sources," "No price increases allowed," but in fact, prices are rising on their own. What is the reason for this? I see that some people are tacitly protecting profiteers, some people are just getting by, and some people just don't want to suffer losses themselves. Originally, these are all Chinese habits, and Chinese "habits" are not thorough. We must find the root of the problem and solve it thoroughly so that such an unfortunate incident of a general leave of absence will not happen again.</p>

<p>Correction from a Letter to the Editor Mr. Editor: June 25th</p>
<p>Your newspaper published a communication from Wu Junyangzhen entitled "How Can There Be Boundaries in Preventing Tiger Plague," and on June 30th, your newspaper's Suzhou communication stated that the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau controlled vaccines and prohibited sales to other cities. After investigation, both are inconsistent with the facts. The reply is as follows: (1) According to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, ten trucks were provided to our bureau for the purpose of clearing garbage; and the Executive Yuan allocated 20 million yuan to purchase epidemic prevention equipment to assist local epidemic prevention. Both were handled during the tenure of the former director Yu Qian, and most of them had already been delivered, but the supply was only fully delivered now. After I took office, I sent a letter to the Executive Yuan requesting to borrow ten cars, but it was not approved, and the reply was "Sorry, I cannot comply." After repeated requests, it was agreed to send five trucks every day to pick up and drop off the staff of the office, and to use the remaining time to pick up and drop off epidemic prevention workers. Ten trucks were borrowed from the US military and two ambulances were borrowed from the fire department, and all were returned after the general mobilization for epidemic prevention was completed. In addition, 4,800 pounds of cotton, 4,980 pounds of DDT, 210 injection needles, and 45 sprayers and 625 pounds of DDT were borrowed from the US Red Cross. All must be returned within three months. It is clear that there is no distinction between thickness and thinness. (2) The vaccines used by our bureau are all made by our bureau's Health Experimental Institute and have a considerable reserve. It can still produce 40,000 doses per month. The words "controlling vaccines and prohibiting sales to other cities" are absolutely not true. For the above two items, please correct them together! Zhang Wei, July 1st.</p>

<h3>Answering Readers' Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(1) Zhou Zhimin from Xiaoshan: A friend of mine rented a house in a certain county before the War of Resistance to run a business, and paid a deposit of several hundred yuan in legal tender. Now the landlord is very anxious to get the house back and must terminate the lease, but the price of legal tender before the war is very different from the current price of legal tender, and the problem arises in the value of the currency. (1) According to the government's interpretation of laws and regulations, if 10,000 yuan in legal tender was deposited in the bank before the war, only interest will be paid when it is paid out now, and it is definitely not possible to convert the pre-war value of the currency into materials. Is this correct at this moment? (2) Can the tenant ask the landlord to return the deposit by converting the pre-war value of the currency into materials, and then converting the materials into currency at today's prices to complete the formalities? Is there any legal basis for the above method?</p>
<p>"Answer by Lawyer Zhu Yakui" Although it is not possible to convert the currency value into materials and then convert the materials into currency value, according to Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Lawsuits After the Recovery, if it is obviously unfair, the court may be requested to make a fair ruling.</p>
<p>(2) Lu Weixiong asks: In the spring of 1943, a British merchant borrowed 100,000 yuan of Central Reserve Notes out of friendship, explaining that he would pay it back in face value in the future. There is a letter as proof (at that time, he was entering a concentration camp, and the price of rice was 400 yuan of puppet currency per dan). Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the British man has regained his freedom and is now living a wealthy life, but he is ignoring the loan.</p>
<p>1. Is there a legal provision for returning the loan at today's market price?</p>
<p>2. If he does not return it, how should it be resolved? Can I file a lawsuit? What are the procedures?</p>
<p>Please answer in detail, I am very grateful.</p>
<p>"Answer by Lawyer Zhu Yakui" (1) (2) According to Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Lawsuits After the Recovery, that is, if after the establishment of a legal act, due to reasons not attributable to the parties, the circumstances change, which could not have been foreseen at the time, and if the original effect is obviously unfair, the court should make a fair ruling and make a judgment to increase or decrease the payment or change its original effect. What you are asking about can be requested from the court to increase the amount at its discretion in accordance with the above article.</p>
<h3>Chaozhou and Shantou Disaster Victims Appeal: Save Disaster by Saving Food</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor: After reading the newspaper, I saw that the Chaozhou and Shantou Association in Shanghai respectfully informed the fellow villagers in Shanghai to save at least one day of food per month, one thousand yuan per day. After reading it, I was very moved, and I would like to appeal to the fellow villagers in Shanghai on behalf of the disaster victims in Chaozhou and Shantou for help. I urge your newspaper to disclose this. In Chaozhou and Shantou today, where the rice famine is serious and the starving people are everywhere, all of us fellow villagers in Shanghai should actively participate in saving food, donate more, and be generous. The disaster victims are fortunate, and the homeland is fortunate! I would like to appeal to the fellow villagers in Shanghai on behalf of the disaster victims in Chaozhou and Shantou, "Save one more day of food" and "Save one more life," so that the disaster victims in Chaozhou and Shantou can avoid starving to death. The merits are immeasurable. The disaster situation in Chaozhou and Shantou is serious and truly unbearable to witness. Corpses are seen on the road every day. How can our enthusiastic people sit idly by and not save them? Finally, I would like to beg for help from all the benevolent people in Shanghai. Although Chaozhou and Shantou are small cities, they are also citizens of the Republic of China. Please treat everyone equally. The merits are immeasurable. Zheng Xingwen, one of the disaster victims in Chaozhou and Shantou, respectfully.</p>

<h3>The Anguish of Students Without Credentials</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor: Today, I saw a notice on the bulletin board, the main point of which was, "By order of the Bureau of Education, all students must submit their credentials by a specific date for verification by the Bureau of Education. Those without credentials will not be approved. If they are not submitted within three days, they will be considered auditing students." Oh no! Are we students without credentials to be subjected to such punishment? Auditing students are merely appendages in the school. At the end of the semester, they don't receive transfer certificates, and upon graduation, they don't receive diplomas. In other words, society does not recognize us as high school students, and our education is greatly affected. The purpose of credentials is to prove a student's qualifications and level. What qualifications you have dictates what credentials you get. We have the qualifications, so why aren't we given the credentials we deserve? Moreover, can a single credential absolutely guarantee a student's qualifications and level? A student without qualifications, if they have money, can buy a diploma; if they have connections, they can finagle a transfer certificate. This is the dark side of society. We are confident that our academic knowledge is up to standard, which can be seen in our quiz scores. If the Bureau of Education wants to know our academic level, an exam is a legitimate method, so why not use it? If, after the exam, our qualifications are not enough for high school, we would willingly repeat a year. We absolutely cannot accept the term "auditing student." May I ask how many factories and companies are currently open in China that can provide work for us "auditing students" who seem to be "sentenced to death" with no way out? Speaking of which, someone will surely question us, "Why don't you have transfer certificates?" I can tell you that some of us studied in "puppet schools." When the "puppet schools" were taken over by "real schools," we were eliminated. There are also some who fled to the countryside during the war, but still did not lose their ambition to study, diligently studying on their own. After the victory, they don't have certificates and will also suffer the fate of being "auditing students." There are even more who lost their certificates and whose schools have closed, making it impossible to resubmit them. Wouldn't that be a cry of endless suffering? Someone will surely ask again, "Why study at a puppet school? Why not study in the Great Rear Area?" Our only answer is one word: "No money." As for the so-called puppet schools, I didn't read books like "Greater East Asia," "Divine Japan," or "Peaceful Nation Building," which promoted slave education. As for "Japanese," almost every school opened by Chinese in the occupied areas taught "Japanese." If we shouldn't study Japanese, please have the Ministry of Education close all the current "German classes." The people in the occupied areas have endured days of deep suffering, and now they have to suffer such a blow from the democratic government? In our High School Class B, with eighty people, almost half don't have certificates. It's probably the same in other grades, and there are quite a few other schools with this situation. Oh no! The futures of so many young students are going to be buried! Finally, we earnestly request that the Ministry of Education postpone the implementation of this measure for two years. We know that your newspaper's opinions are fair and speak for the people. We are writing this article in the hope that it will be published. Signed, Yu Guan'ao, He Zhijian, and Wang Jinlin, students without credentials from High School Class B, Zhaohe Middle School.</p>
<p>The Same Academic Ability Should Qualify for University Entrance</p>
<p>Mr. Editor: Some time ago, your newspaper discussed the issue of selecting talented students for studying abroad. The last paragraph briefly stated that the qualifications for studying abroad should not be limited to university graduates with diplomas, because there are many young people who study diligently on their own and have the equivalent of a university degree, and aspire to study abroad, but because they don't have a diploma, they cannot participate in the exam, which is still a loss in terms of the country recognizing talent. Therefore, to select true talent, as long as the exam is strict, why is a diploma necessary? After reading it, I felt very encouraged. These are the heartfelt words of ambitious young people without diplomas, and it can also be said to be a kind of anguish. Fortunately, your newspaper solemnly raised it. Recently, the Ministry of Education issued the qualifications for the study abroad exam, adding the item of "Higher Examination," which is held by the Examination Yuan's Examination and Selection Committee during the Higher Examination. Although there is still a distance from what your newspaper said, it can be seen that the Ministry of Education is paying attention to this and is taking action. Therefore, it reminds me that the qualifications for university entrance examinations should also include the item of "equivalent academic ability." Because during these eight years of the War of Resistance, countless young people lost their education. Directly, their homes were destroyed, and they not only lost their education but also became refugees. Indirectly, due to the war, their parents or siblings could not maintain the family's livelihood. And I am a child who lost my father early in life. Usually, I rely on my old mother's savings to barely continue my studies, but when prices soared and even making a living became a problem, I could only drop out of school and go into business. How could my parents bear to let their children suffer the pain of losing their education? How could my old mother bear to let me take on the heavy burden of life at a young age? However, we, these young people who lost our education, swallowed our bitter tears and "voluntarily dropped out of school" to work. However, we never forgot to study in our spare time, so it was like work-study, but not as good as work-study. Work-study is going to a formal school to study, and finding work outside of class to support one's personal life, but we have to use what we earn to maintain part or all of our living expenses, stealing time from our busy lives to study some main subjects, such as Chinese and English. But higher education, specializing in a certain science, is not available in tutoring schools. Fortunately, Hujiang, Soochow, and Datong Universities, Chengming College of Commerce, and Lixin Accounting School all have evening classes set up purely for working youth. However, only Lixin has the item of "equivalent academic ability" that can be taken in the exam. The Ministry of Education educates the people, just like parents raise their children, it is a responsibility and an obligation. People receiving education is the enjoyment of a right. Therefore, the country must ensure that every person can obtain this full right, even disabled or deaf-mute people, they must also find ways to provide them with a corresponding education. Now the Ministry of Education takes in and trains refugee youth, and society provides student aid to parents who cannot afford tuition, and schools also have scholarships for the poor. All of these are intended to prevent young people from losing their education. Therefore, I hope that universities with evening classes will add equivalent academic ability to the qualifications for entrance examinations. (Lixin Vocational School already has it in the last issue, and the Chinese American Evening Post on the 25th had information about the entrance examination of National Central University, and equivalent academic ability was also included in the qualifications for the entrance examination.) As long as the exam is strict, there won't be people with too much difference in level mixing in. But those with slightly lower levels should also be admitted leniently, and given a probationary period in the first semester. If, after the probationary period, their grades are too poor, they should be given the opportunity to make up for it, so that they can keep up with the class in an orderly manner. If the probationary grades are still acceptable, they will be promoted to the second semester as formal students. In this way, young people who have lost their education will not be excluded from the school. Reader, Tang Jin, High School. June 26th.</p>

<p>— Zhang Wenyu</p>
<p>By Zhuang Zeyi, Published by Zhonghua Book Company</p>
<p>First edition, January of the 35th year of the Republic</p>
<p>The War of Resistance against Japan has ended in victory, and the overall situation in China has changed with the global situation. Which path should Chinese education take? The author does not clearly point out this question in this book. This is because the book was completed in the 30th year of the Republic, and is based on the author's lecture notes on "Chinese Education Problems" given to postgraduate students of education at Lingnan University in the autumn of the 29th year of the Republic. Regarding education issues, the author first describes past solutions to various problems, as well as their difficulties and shortcomings, and then supplements them with the paths that he has advocated for the past 20 years. Here is a summary of the main points:</p>
<p>(1) Academic Education – The author advocates that university education should focus on academic research and be separated from specialized schools of a technical, professional, or vocational nature. The courses offered in universities should be determined by the professors' expertise, and the curriculum should not be predetermined and then forcing professors to teach courses that are not their strengths. Therefore, university presidents and professors must be academic experts, and politicians and merchants should not be allowed to interfere. University student entrance exams should select true talent and should not be limited by qualifications. There are two goals for sending students abroad: to apply what they have learned and to conduct academic research. However, since the War of Resistance against Japan, there has been a passive policy of studying abroad that completely ignores academic research.</p>
<p>(2) Specialized and Vocational Education – The nature and status of specialized schools lie in training specialists and cultivating institutions for various technologies. The establishment of specialized schools should be adapted to the times and circumstances and must be closely related to the central or provincial construction plans. After the War of Resistance against Japan, the training institutes for local cadres established in the rear provinces placed too much emphasis on formal training and neglected skills training. The author believes that the training of local cadres should refer to the prior experience of the Shandong Zouping Rural Construction Research Institute, dividing it into research and training departments. The training of mid-level vocational talents should be linked to public and private factories, transportation, medicine, surveying, accounting, and other institutions, and practical vocational schools should be widely established. At the same time, attention should be paid to promoting vocational training and supplementary education for workers. If the method of teacher training in normal schools is still adopted, it is feared that it will be less effective. A three-in-one system should be implemented, with principals of national and central schools also serving as local construction cadres. Teacher training can adopt the method of the Zouping Rural Construction Training Department, recruiting junior high school graduates for training. As for the training of teachers for various secondary schools, normal colleges should train teachers for ordinary middle schools, and departments of arts and sciences in universities should be allowed to minor in more than ten credits in education to prepare them for teaching positions, while teachers for vocational schools must be trained by agricultural, industrial, and commercial specialized colleges.</p>
<p>(3) General Education – Ordinary middle schools are institutions that prepare students for further education, and ordinary middle schools also serve as vocational preparation, resulting in neither achieving either goal. Since middle schools are institutions that prepare students for further education, the curriculum should be based on further education. Graduation exams hinder academic progress and health. If grade promotion and elimination are strictly enforced, graduation exams are not necessary. The current national education system is four years, but in terms of national finance and the national economic situation, it is extremely difficult to achieve. If the age of enrollment is raised and completed in two years, and then supplementary education is provided, the effect will be greater. The senior elementary school system is copied from Japan. If the senior elementary school is abolished and the middle school is changed to an eight-year system, with four years for junior high school and four years for senior high school, it will be easier to achieve results.</p>
<p>(4) Social Education – Popularizing basic education for out-of-school people, focusing on literacy education and also focusing on the instilling of common knowledge. The establishment of civil education centers, libraries, museums, etc., should take into account material resources and human resources. In terms of civil education centers, the facilities for livelihood should be more important than the literacy section. To effectively implement electrical education, there must be specialized personnel to manage it. These specialized personnel can be trained by the construction colleges in various provinces. Other things such as drama and music are also important tools for promoting social education and must be promoted. Addendum on education in the border areas and education for overseas Chinese. Border education should be divided into two types: one for the Han people in the border areas and one for the education of the Mongolian, Tibetan, Hui, Miao, and other ethnic groups. Education for the Han people in the border areas should be no different from that of the Han people in the interior, and education for all ethnic groups should be treated with absolute equality. Regarding education for overseas Chinese, the goals are talent and funding, and the fundamental solution lies in consolidating the facilities for education for overseas Chinese and enhancing the status of overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>(5) Educational Administration and Funding – The authority of the central educational administration should be gradually reduced to allow for the free development of education in various places that is more suitable for local needs. Provincial and county local educational administrative agencies should be improved, and more normal schools should be established in various provinces to be responsible for the educational administration of various regions, and educational and political personnel below the county level should also be specialized in their positions. Inspection and guidance should be promoted simultaneously, and advisory and research institutions should be established in a practical manner. The treatment of teachers must be improved and the teaching profession must be guaranteed. Not only should educational funding be increased, but it must also be used properly. Private schools should be valued and encouraged.</p>
<p>After reading this book, I have a feeling that the author's analysis is well-organized and comprehensive, which is his strength. The title of the book is "The Road to Reforming Chinese Education," but what is the direction of the reform? The author does not point out the basic trend of reforming Chinese education, nor does he propose a reform plan that targets the poor, weak, ignorant, and selfish educational background of China. What China needs now is education that cultivates democracy and the rule of law, and education that cultivates scientific construction. The promotion of academics must have free development research, and the training of skills must naturally take life and welfare as its goals. Therefore, democracy and science are the general directions for reforming Chinese education.</p>
<h3>Nehru's Autobiography</h3>
<p>— Zhu Jiaqing</p>
<p>Translated by Bi Lai, Published by Xinzhi Bookstore</p>
<p>"The ultimate goal of India is a united, free, and democratic country: she is closely connected with other free nations in a world federation." – Nehru.</p>
<p>Mr. Nehru is the leader of the Indian National Congress. He was born in Allahabad on November 14, 1889. His father and uncle both practiced law. Especially his father, although he was an Indian bourgeois who admired the British gentleman's style, he was a fervent veteran of the national independence movement. His mother, wife, and sisters also contributed their efforts to the Indian independence movement. This had a profound influence on Mr. Nehru's personality.</p>
<p>Mr. Nehru lived in a pampered environment in his childhood. At that time, the Indian people not only endured the pain of British oppression, but also suffered from the bullying of Anglo-Indian mixed-race people and the Indian social classes. These unequal phenomena and painful lessons left a deep impression on Mr. Nehru's young mind.</p>
<p>Mr. Nehru left India for England to study at the age of fifteen. England was a country with a strong interest in politics. At that time, India was also constantly launching a struggle for national independence. This determined the form of his life after returning to China. When he was in Cambridge, he had already responded to Tilak's radicals in spirit, advocating opposing kneeling to England in a heroic posture.</p>
<p>At that time, the Fabian Socialism (Jabian Social Sm) in England was popular for a while, and Mr. Nehru was very interested in it; this laid a foundation for his political thought.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1912, Mr. Nehru obtained his qualifications. He returned to China to carry out his family's law business. At that time, it was just before the outbreak of the First World War, and nationalism and patriotism filled the whole world; India was of course greatly disturbed. The independence movement was actively launched from this. Following that was the brutal suppression by the British, which led to a fierce struggle. As a result, a large number of Indian people were massacred or arrested. Seeing this situation, Mr. Nehru and his father resolutely gave up their careers and participated in the struggle of the Indian nation. They responded to Mahatma Gandhi's civil resistance movement and engaged in various anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggles.</p>
<p>At that time, the Indian political movement was centered on the bourgeoisie and ignored the vast masses of workers and peasants. Mr. Nehru, with his fearless spirit, engaged in various labor movements and won their love and support.</p>
<p>In 1921, due to the vigorous development of the non-cooperation movement, and the opposition to the visit of the British Crown Prince in various places in India; it constituted a full-scale Indian riot. Many colleagues working in the National Assembly were arrested. Mr. Nehru and his father were also imprisoned one after another. This was the first time in his political activities that he had lived such a prison life. Because of the surging Indian revolutionary movement, it was commonplace for Mr. Nehru and he was ready at any time. However, he was very good at using his prison life to read and write; to study various Indian and international issues.</p>
<p>Mr. Nehru has been arrested and imprisoned more than a dozen times in political struggles. The longest imprisonment has lasted for nearly three years. Until recently, we could still read news of his arrest and release in the news!</p>
<p>Mr. Nehru has chaired the National Assembly twice, and has also served as the secretary of the Assembly many times. In this National Assembly, sometimes due to the evolution of the political situation, it was divided into "moderates", "radicals", or "revisionists" and "conservatives". In fact, the so-called "moderate" and "revision" are just attempts to compromise with the British. Among them, of course, the voice of "regional autonomy" is the highest.</p>
<p>The absurdity of the theory of regional autonomy is despised by Mr. Nehru and others. They take Islam as the starting point and emphasize "Islamic culture". They believe that the culture between India and Islam is irreconcilable. Therefore, their conclusion is that British rule must always exist in India in order to reconcile the conflict between the two cultures. This argument is really aiding and abetting the tiger. We place unlimited regrets on the success of the Indian independence movement.</p>
<p>Mr. Nehru's political proposition is a thorough revolution; not a superficial renewal. What he is fighting for for India is complete independence; and it is by no means begging for favor from Britain, attempting to get some favor.</p>
<p>This proposition is very different from that of Mahatma Gandhi. Mahatma Gandhi's attention is on the personal religious influence; to put it plainly: this is simply political religionization. Mr. Nehru is not like this; although he supports Mahatma Gandhi's revolutionary means, he cannot agree with the views of praising "poverty", "suffering", and "self-control"; promoting "simple peasant life"; and denying that "science is enough to improve human life." In short, Mahatma Gandhi's thought is purely Indian, personal, religious, and backward; while Mr. Nehru's thought is Europeanized, national, scientific, and progressive.</p>
<p>In fact, this "Nehru Biography" is better to be read as a history of the Indian national revolution than as a biography. Of course, Mr. Nehru's strong national consciousness and patriotic enthusiasm are worthy of our young people's respect.</p>

<h3>Introducing Several Radio Publications</h3>
<p>— Mu Zai</p>
<p>After the war, the radio amateur activities that had been interrupted for a while have gradually recovered their past prosperity, and radio publications have also appeared one after another. They are introduced separately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) "Radio World" Monthly – This is a publication sponsored by C.A.R.L., written by amateur radio operators from all over the country. It was founded in Chongqing. Due to material limitations, only one sheet of four-open newspaper type was published, a total of two issues. After the victory, it was once suspended. It has been revived in Beijing in February of this year and has published four issues. The content of the publication is more extensive, divided into columns such as special essays, experiments, communications, introductory guides, rare news, and amateur scenery. The selection of materials is deeper. In addition to the long series of introductions to radio, which is very suitable for beginners, the experimental fee is less. It is heard that it is gradually being improved and experimental manuscripts and reference circuits are being added to help beginners. The publication has many wonderful manuscripts and is worthy of amateur comrades' research and reference.</p>
<p>(2) Practical Radio Magazine – The publication was founded before the war and was suspended after the fall of Shanghai. It has now been revived in January of this year and published three issues. The content is also lacking in experimental manuscripts because amateur research was affected by the war and was suspended. However, the selection of materials and layout have been greatly improved and enriched compared to the previous "Electrical Engineering", and it tends to explore radio theory. The writers are all amateurs in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(3) Amateur Radio Magazine – This publication is not run by the Chinese Amateur Radio Association, and has nothing to do with C.A.R.L. It is published by the Amateur Radio Research Society. It was published before the war and was suspended after the fall of Shanghai. It was revived in May of this year. The content is still the same as before the war. Extremely poor, although there are many circuit diagrams, they are all experimental manuscripts that have not been tested. The effectiveness is not to be easily believed. It is hoped that the publication can fully improve and help amateur researchers.</p>
<h3>Review of Zhang Dongsun's "Thought and Society"</h3>
<p>— Traditional Light</p>
<p>I previously introduced and briefly reviewed Mr. Zhang Dongsun's book "Knowledge and Culture" in this publication. Mr. Dongsun wrote to say, "Your comments were insightful and deeply appreciated." Later, he sent me a copy of his recently published "Thought and Society" in Chongqing, a sequel to the former book, and informed me that "Reason and Democracy" would be published by the end of September. These are three books he wrote during the period of occupation. We feel that Mr. Zhang has fulfilled his duty during the Anti-Japanese War. We further hope that Mr. Zhang will devote most of his time and energy to philosophical writing in the future. This is not to discourage Mr. Zhang from concerning himself with politics, but I would prefer that he maintain the attitude of a philosopher. As he himself said, "A philosopher is not responsible for administration. Because if he becomes an administrative leader, he may not be able to preserve his ideals and will inevitably have to compromise. The value of a philosopher lies in his ability to see the ideal and to know what is true and good." (Thought and Society, page 194)</p>
<p>In recent years, Mr. Zhang's research has aimed to establish a complete epistemology from the perspectives of psychology, philosophy, and sociology. He has elaborated on this point in detail in his book "Knowledge and Culture." The goal of "Thought and Society," which we are reviewing now, is to explain "the relationship between theoretical knowledge, represented by philosophy, and practical social life." On the one hand, he explains how theoretical knowledge is determined by human social life; on the other hand, he expounds on the guiding role of theoretical speculation in social progress and human behavior. This question is also what I have been trying to answer in recent years. My humble work "Education and Social Reconstruction" also seeks a way out in this regard. However, my humble work focuses more on social evolution, while Mr. Zhang's "Thought and Society" is still more inclined toward philosophical theory. Mr. Zhang's basic attitude in this book is that "all past philosophies are merely the theorization of social thought," and that the new philosophy he has created is "in response to the cultural needs of this era." In short, theoretical knowledge is both a product of social life and has a guiding influence on social life. Thus, he incidentally finds a way to explain why he studies philosophy and also engages in politics.</p>
<p>The entire book consists of nine chapters, which can be divided into six parts: (1) A general discussion of the social factors of human thought (Chapter 1 of the original book); (2) An explanation of three systems of knowledge; (3) The relationship between philosophy and social organization (Chapters 3 and 4 of the original book); (4) China's Daoist tradition—family thought and Neo-Confucian thought (Chapters 5 and 6); (5) The Western Daoist tradition—Christian thought, socialism, and ____-ism (Chapters 7 and 8); (6) The way out for Chinese culture (Chapter 9). This publication has previously provided a brief introduction to the content. This article only intends to directly raise a few points for criticism. However, Mr. Zhang's books should not be read in a fragmented way but should be viewed as a whole. Therefore, readers who wish to understand Mr. Zhang's entire thought must read the original book in one sitting.</p>
<p>From Mr. Zhang's writings, we can see that he has two strengths, which are also his weaknesses. Mr. Zhang has a very high intellect, so he often has very profound "insights." He grasps the core of the problem and puts forward rich insights. This is his first strength. However, because he has high wisdom and rich insights, he often directly presents many conclusions, neglecting to guide the reader along a clear logical path, and rarely gives us reasons for proof (Arguments). Therefore, when we read Mr. Zhang's book, we jump around from one place to another.</p>
<p>Secondly, Mr. Zhang has extensive knowledge, and his reading is truly admirable. Therefore, his thinking is multifaceted and his meaning is very complex. He often feels that he has a thousand words to say and can't stop pouring them out when he encounters a problem. As a result, he leads the reader meanderingly to an unknown destination. He promises the reader to solve this problem, but after he has just said it, he talks about another problem. The reader feels that the answer seems irrelevant to the question. In fact, there may be a close connection between them, but it is too complex or too lengthy for us to grasp.</p>
<p>When Mr. Zhang discusses the Daoist tradition of China and the West, he only talks about the connection of a few dominant concepts in the history of thought. As for why these concepts are adapted to the cultural needs of the time and how they affect the social situation at the time, Mr. Zhang does not tell us, which does not seem to conform to the main theme of the book.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the way out for Chinese culture, Mr. Zhang only focuses on the scholar class (i.e., intellectuals), as if as long as they serve as the outlet for society and contribute to the entire culture, "constantly resisting the tendency of culture itself to become petrified," this nation can be revived. I dare not believe this. Our national character has its own living background. If the living background does not change, and only a general scholar class expresses pure opinions, I believe that the nation has no way to improve. In my opinion, if politics does not get on the right track and economic life does not improve, even if the "Education Association" is successfully established, at most it will only train a group of bookworms. It is important to know that if bees do not collect flower stamens but eat tree roots, they cannot produce honey. An intellectual or a group of intellectuals cannot create new blood in a political situation where they are not fed enough, are barely alive, and are constantly fighting for power and profit. Of course, I am not saying that thought has no impact on the social situation, but if you want to find a way out for a culture, in addition to the inspiration of thought, you must work simultaneously in politics, economy, social atmosphere, and other aspects.</p>
<h3>After Reading "Early Love"</h3>
<p>— Zheng Jia'ai</p>
<p>Ruvim Frayerman is a talented young Soviet novelist; he first moved Soviet readers with a full-length novel about the revolutionary youth of Northeast China, called: Vassaka Red Partisan. In 1940, his first masterpiece, Early live "Early Love," was translated into English and published in "International Literature" in the January, February and March issues; later, this novel was adapted into a new play and performed at the "Moscow Young Audience Theater." In the spring of 1941, Mr. Hu Shanyuan translated it into Chinese and introduced it to our country's readers.</p>
<p>The title "Early Love" easily leads people to mistake it for a "pure love" tragic masterpiece, but after you read it, you will find that there is no tortuous and bizarre romantic novel here; as the translator said: "If you hold any 'romantic' or 'erotic' thoughts in mind when you look at its plot, you will be disappointed. You still have to look at it with the eyes of appreciating the structure of a peerless masterpiece, then you will get your wish and return fully loaded…"; indeed, this is a good novel that cannot be ignored in literary works, and the author's characteristic is "rich in lyrical sentences and psychological analysis." "Early Love" takes children as the protagonists. Frayerman fully developed his talent and intelligence when describing these children's "statues." The most ordinary stories are the most meaningful and the most vivid. "Early Love" cannot find the words "love" or "like," but the whole story is full of immortal friendship and love.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Danya, the girl who had just turned fifteen, had always been a good friend of Nanna youth Philga. Every year, when summer was over and the camping life ended, they returned home to wait for the start of another semester.</p>
<p>Danya and her mother lived with an old nanny. Her small home was always very peaceful. Her mother was a good assistant in the hospital, and Danya studied at school, but she was dissatisfied and unhappy because she had never seen her father——now he lived far away in Moscow, loved another woman, and separated from his wife many years ago when Danya was still a baby.</p>
<p>This time, Danya had just returned from camping, and she unintentionally found a letter from her father to her mother, saying that he was coming back soon, and also bringing his mistress and the mistress's nephew, called Gaoliya, with him. With a happy mood, she rushed to the pier on that morning to greet her father, but when the passengers on the ship were gone, she could not find the person she wanted to receive, so she had to return disappointed. Before leaving, she put lilies beside the boy sleeping on the stretcher. She sobbed softly, who knew that this boy was Gaoliya.</p>
<p>Father finally came to see Danya, and she got infinite joy, but Father still lived with his mistress elsewhere, and Danya's mood was sad.</p>
<p>At school, Philga was originally Danya's good friend. Since Gaoliya came, he was even more able to make Danya pay attention to her and fall in love with him. Philga felt unbearable pain, but did not hurt their friendship. He cherished Danya more than himself; although Danya was not as fond of him as before.</p>
<p>Festivals, New Year, and many happy days passed. In a violent storm, Danya encountered difficulties in saving Gaoliya, but fortunately, Philga led everyone to rescue them, and they were able to escape the danger. Philga had always been a good boy.</p>
<p>Finally, Danya decided to give up love for the sake of her only mother's happiness, and she left the two boys; but none of them could forget each other, and Danya was always a good friend in their minds.</p>
<p>The author of "Early Love" presents a vivid picture before our eyes with his precise psychological analysis and superior technology. Although the background of this story is in the ice and snow of the northern country, although the personalities of the protagonists are so rough and stubborn, and although there are no moving and great scenes in it; "Early Love" is still beautiful; the name can remind people of the atmosphere there: the river that children love is dark; the mountains covered with fir trees flow, ants crawl all over the bark, children chew resin with their snow-white teeth, and they prefer to eat venison. In winter, heavy snow covers the vast plains and cliffs. Sometimes there should be terrible storms coming. This novel not only renders a strong local color, but the most unforgettable thing is the description of the mood; we know that the psychology of children in the last period is very complicated and subtle; writers with poor cultivation are very difficult to portray vividly, but Frayerman is successful. He wrote delicately and beautifully, and many beautiful words flowed out naturally, like a gurgling stream in a deep mountain, and your mood followed it to that realm, so you seemed to clearly see the mountains, waters, vegetation, wind, snow and birds and animals in that place, and your emotions were more closely tied to the children's joy and sorrow, unable to get rid of them. When Danya first approached her father, the author wrote this;</p>
<p>"She leaned gently on his shoulder.</p>
<p>"Tell me everything, maybe I can help you, what is bothering you, what's on your mind?"</p>
<p>But she said nothing, because what she was thinking at that time was: "I have a mother, a home, a meal, even a dog and a cat, but I don't have a father…"</p>
<p>She only squeezed closer to him, leaning on his chest.</p>
<p>But, ah, leaning on Father's chest, how sweet that is! Jumping now is not spring, although it is humid outdoors here after the cold rain, although there are some chills under the thin clothes, but even on this late autumn evening, Danya felt warm? She and her father sat together for a long time, until the stars she loved shone on the road to the fortress, on the lime-sprinkled path, and on the house with glass doors."</p>
<p>The following is a description of Danya's dream:</p>
<p>“…So what happened today? Is it that the river flowing into the sea put these strange thoughts into her head? She had watched the river with a vague premonition, she had hoped to float with it, but where to go? Why are the thoughts of Australian wild dogs so tempting to her? What do Australian wild dogs have to do with her? Is this because her childhood is slowly slipping away? Who can really know when childhood will end and the next era will begin?…”</p>
<p>Later, Danya was about to leave her old home, and Philga was very embarrassed when he learned the news. He cut the five letters "Tanya" (丹雅) out of white paper and put them on his chest, letting the sun scorch them every day. As a result, his body left white names. He was seen by Danya: "You are such a child, Philga, but when winter comes, you put on a warm shirt, and it will fade completely." Philga's face was depressed, and he looked around in confusion, the hot sand and the river sparkled in the mountains, like a golden valley. His inner turmoil reached its peak, he completely forgot about winter, and when he exposed his body to the scorching sun, he didn't think about winter at all.</p>
<p>"Oh, what kind of person am I!" he cried.</p>
<p>"But the sun is so powerful, he insisted, "It won't disappear completely, will it? Maybe something will be left, Danya?" he pleaded.</p>
<p>Danya thought for a moment and agreed.</p>
<p>"You are right," she said, "Something will definitely be left. Everything will disappear, that won't happen. Otherwise, where will our eternal friendship go?"</p>
<p>The two children embraced, and the warm air fanned their cheeks, and a lonely bird poked its head out from their tall branches to look at them.</p>
<p>Childhood has ended! But exactly when? Who can solve this mystery for them? Not sand, not forest, not stones, those are always with them….”</p>
<p>"Early Love" is an excellent novel, and I would like to introduce it to readers who love literature and art.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on the Techniques of Novels</h3>
<p>— Hu Shanyuan</p>
<p>In the past few months, I have made up my mind to read all the short and long stories published in various new magazines. The result is this:</p>
<p>All formal novels, that is, novels published in formal magazines, except for a very small part that is slightly entertaining or propagandistic, can be praised for their content, have valuable themes, and can inspire, motivate, or make people think deeply. However, their techniques are the opposite, and they can be compared with the most excellent or the latest techniques. There are very few of them, and most of them are either top-heavy, or bloated and deformed, or tell stories, or talk about love, or write introductions, or write manuals, unlike writing novels. On the contrary, some novels published in entertainment magazines without serious and profound content have very satisfactory techniques: they can really be worthy of the evaluation of well-proportioned bones and flesh, and careful weighing.</p>
<p>Why is this happening? Of course, it is better to have poor techniques than poor content. Good content does not waste ink, and good techniques alone are definitely not the mission of a novel. However, what a wonderful thing it would be to have good content paired with good techniques! Moreover, with good techniques, it is not easy to install good content, because content is as if it can be forced, and techniques are just experience and effort. With good content, it is not difficult to obtain good techniques. Now the reason why good content is not paired with good techniques may be these points:</p>
<p>One is that the importance of content is overemphasized, while techniques are ignored. If authors with content can pay more attention to techniques, they will definitely be able to solve various difficulties and shortcomings in techniques. One is that techniques are fundamentally looked down upon. This only requires that the author eliminate his prejudice. One is that the author does not know how to write to qualify. It is not difficult, as long as you refer to writers and works who are good at techniques.</p>
<p>In the past, Lu Xun's and Ye Shaojun's short stories could be used as models of techniques. As for long novels, Mao Dun's techniques are relatively the most successful. In terms of countries, there are many, not to mention Maupassant, who is farther away, Gorky, who is closer, is very qualified, and most of the recent writers can also be imitated. (The "Arch of Triumph" published in Zhengyan Newspaper is really a good specimen of techniques. Not many people paid attention when it was published, and now it is not published anymore, which is a pity!)</p>
<p>In recent years, in Shanghai, there are several people who write novels well, that is, those with proper content and excellent techniques: such as Shen Ji, Shi Qi, Guo Peng, and Tang Xuehua. Now Shi Qi can still see his works, but the others cannot be seen. I don't know if they are still writing. I don't mean to praise them. People who are interested in research may wish to find their works and take a look.</p>
<p>Now the old writers in the mainland are gradually returning, and I hope that I can soon see many novels that are satisfactory in techniques in addition to content.</p>
<h3>Illusion (Novel)</h3>
<p>— Junping</p>
<p>The first major event after Liu Qinghua returned from the Great Rear Area was to announce his unemployment.</p>
<p>His wife felt very anxious, and he himself was also very anxious. Although they could maintain their current life for the time being, what would they do in the future? In the past, when he taught in the Great Rear Area, although life was poor, he could still live on by gritting his teeth. Now, it was simply a big problem how to even survive. Moreover, in the initial three years in the rear, Liu Qinghua was a single wanderer, but now he was the father of two children. He never imagined that after returning to Shanghai from Kunming, he would have nothing to do. He never imagined that his current situation would be even more wretched than the worst times in the past few years.</p>
<p>His wife was not only a fatalist but also a very kind woman. She had no complaints about the current situation, but she couldn't help but feel anxious about the children's lack of nutrition. These situations made Liu Qinghua feel indescribable guilt. He felt that she and the children were innocent and should not suffer like this. Since he had become someone's husband and father, he should support them even in terms of morality, let alone the responsibility he had to fulfill today was far more than just a moral one.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, when he stepped out the door, he saw his wife, Pingping, and Tian Tian, the two children, standing at the entrance of the lane. Pingping saw her father coming and immediately grabbed his long gown: "Daddy, bring Pingping a doll."</p>
<p>"Okay, okay,"</p>
<p>"Daddy, Tian Tian wants candy too." Tian Tian also came over and grabbed him.</p>
<p>"Definitely bring it, definitely bring it."</p>
<p>"Don't pull on Daddy's clothes. Daddy will bring it to you later." His wife hurried over to relieve him.</p>
<p>He didn't know how many times he had given the children such empty promises. Later, even the children began to doubt his promises. Once, Pingping said to him:</p>
<p>"Daddy, the little sister next door bought a toy car yesterday. Why don't you buy me a doll?"</p>
<p>"Daddy will definitely buy one for you."</p>
<p>"Daddy doesn't keep his word. When exactly are you going to buy it?"</p>
<p>When exactly was he going to buy it? Even he himself had no certainty. But he didn't want to see the children's disappointed expressions. He tried his best to keep deceiving them, even though the children had been deceived countless times.</p>
<p>"Buy it tomorrow, definitely buy it for you tomorrow."</p>
<p>He said tomorrow every day, but he never bought it back. Although the children didn't understand the ways of the world, experience told them that Daddy's words were never reliable and had never been fulfilled. Liu Qinghua felt very bitter inside, but he couldn't say anything and wouldn't say anything. He thought that he couldn't even fulfill this minimal request of the children, and he really felt sorry for them. But today, not to mention dolls, even the daily necessities such as firewood, rice, oil, and salt were causing him headaches. So, it didn't seem like an excessive request to offer a perfunctory attitude towards the children's extra demands.</p>
<p>When he strolled back from the street in the evening, the children were already asleep. His wife was sitting on the edge of the bed reading a book, and there seemed to be a hint of melancholy in the silence.</p>
<p>"Did you see Principal Xu today?" his wife asked with great concern.</p>
<p>"I saw him, but..." His expression wasn't very good: "But seeing him and not seeing him is actually no different."</p>
<p>"Why? Can't he find a way to help you?"</p>
<p>"He said that this semester, there's no way to think of anything. If there are any teacher vacancies next semester, he will definitely find a way to arrange something for you. Isn't that the same as saying nothing? There are still six weeks until next semester. Do you think we can maintain our lives for six weeks with this money?"</p>
<p>"If we use it sparingly, we can barely manage for four weeks."</p>
<p>"It's better to rely on yourself than to ask for help from others. Instead of bowing and scraping to ask people for help and seeking referrals, it's better to find a job myself. Roads are made by people walking. Don't you think so?"</p>
<p>His wife nodded because she really had nothing to say. During these many days, it wasn't that Liu Qinghua wasn't trying to find work, but all he got in return was cold ridicule or just empty talk. Once a person becomes poor, even familiar relatives and friends will become strangers. If there really is warmth in the human world, it's only heard of and not seen. Now, not only was Liu Qinghua starting to doubt many things in the world, but even his wife felt that there was little optimism in asking others to find a job. However, his wife still had to ask him:</p>
<p>"You said you'll find a job yourself. How are you going to find it?"</p>
<p>"I saw in the newspaper today that a business company is hiring clerks, and the salary is 200,000 yuan per month, in addition to providing board and lodging. I'm going to try it out, whether it succeeds or not."</p>
<p>His wife was very excited because she knew that he wasn't a layman in clerical work. Although he couldn't say he had any certainty in this, among many uncertain events, this seemed to have a little bit of certainty.</p>
<p>The next morning, Liu Qinghua hurried to the Dasheng Enterprise Company. The enterprise company borrowed a right wing room from someone to do business, and the scale was very small. He walked into the right wing room and only saw two slick young men sitting on the sofa chatting.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, is this the Dasheng Enterprise Company?"</p>
<p>"Yes, what is your name?"</p>
<p>"My name is Liu Qinghua. Are you hiring clerks here?"</p>
<p>"That's right. We welcome Mr. Liu to apply, but we haven't met before. According to our rules, we should test Mr. Liu."</p>
<p>"Of course, of course."</p>
<p>After a written test and an oral test, one of the young men went outside and called in a large man in a suit. The large man claimed to be the general manager of Dasheng Enterprise Company. After looking at Liu Qinghua's written test, he said very politely:</p>
<p>"Mr. Liu certainly has considerable experience in clerical work. I admire it very much! Our company's business has been very prosperous recently. This time, we plan to recruit eight clerks to handle all the company's paperwork. This temporary office is about to close. We have already rented a large Western-style house on Huanlong Road, and we will move there to work in five days."</p>
<p>Liu Qinghua realized that he was a bit incoherent because he said a lot of things, but he didn't say what he wanted to say. That sentence was: had Liu Qinghua been hired? So he simply asked him directly.</p>
<p>"Then after looking at my written test, you can certainly know whether I have a chance of being hired?"</p>
<p>"Does that even need to be said?" The large man patted him on the shoulder: "Of course you're hired, of course you're hired. The salary is temporarily set at 200,000 yuan, and it will be increased soon. We also have year-end bonuses here. The amount of the bonus is very considerable. Last year, each employee of our company received a 12-month bonus. For example, if your salary, Mr. Liu, is 200,000 yuan, you can receive a bonus of 2.4 million yuan at the end of the year. This year, our company's profits will probably be even higher than last year, so the amount of the bonus will naturally increase accordingly."</p>
<p>"Then when do I start working at the company?"</p>
<p>"It's best to come tomorrow," the large man said with great concern. "When you come tomorrow, please bring 3 million yuan in cash."</p>
<p>"Why?" He was very surprised.</p>
<p>"All of our employees are required to pay a cash deposit."</p>
<p>"Can't I use a guarantor?"</p>
<p>"No, this is our company's rules for hiring people. The rules cannot be changed casually."</p>
<p>Although the large man's words were very beautiful, experience told him that this was a well-planned performance. If he didn't need 3 million yuan, he might even try it to broaden his horizons, even if it was a waste of time and energy. But where could he find 3 million yuan?</p>
<p>On the way back, his heart was as heavy as a lead stone...</p>

<h3>Flying Together (81)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>The Zhili-Fengtian War broke out!</p>
<p>As a result, all industries were shut down, and people fled to other places. The entire troupe from the theater where Lihua was working, led by Zhang Xian, fled to the Central China area to perform as a traveling troupe. Naturally, Lihua couldn't leave this organization. Mrs. Mo, as well as Liyun, also joined Zhang Xian's troupe. They took the Jinpu train to Xuzhou. They stopped there and signed a six-month contract with a theater owner.</p>
<p>This was the first page of Guanghua's nomadic career as a performer.</p>
<p>Changing to a new environment inevitably brings some new troubles. As the "star" of the troupe, Guan Hua couldn't help but socialize with local people, which is called "paying respects to the local bosses." If you don't do this in this business, there will be a lot of trouble. Lihua had to grit her teeth and deal with it. She began to feel that performing was not simple, and being a star was even more difficult. She used to only know that performing was just fulfilling an obligation, and there was nothing else besides the obligation. Now she realized that in addition to the "obligation," there was also a responsibility - the responsibility of social relationships. This added a lot of pain to Lihua. She could maintain her dignity with her colleagues; with Zhang Xian; and even with Mrs. Mo; but she couldn't maintain her dignity with social people in a new environment - warlords; officials; gentry; celebrities; rich and powerful masters! She had to be humble and respectful to these people; she had to flatter and boast to these people; she had to be obsequious and ingratiating to these people; she had to talk and laugh with these people! Even though she herself didn't directly express it this way, Zhang Xian and Mrs. Mo would express it for her. She was like a beggar fallen into a foreign land, stretching out her hand; bending her knees; asking these people for food! And she was asking for food for many people! Although she felt that it was even more humiliating than performing, she could only "close her eyes" and endure it!</p>
<p>In Xuzhou, Lihua was still very popular, as red as the "stars in the sky"! So red that many masters were fascinated by her, the old ones wanted to recognize her as a goddaughter, and the young ones wanted to make friends with her. What "recognizing as a goddaughter"? What "making friends"? They just wanted to take the opportunity to get close to her.</p>
<h3>Homesickness</h3>
<p>— Ling Yu</p>
<p>It's been half a year since I left Northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>In the past six months, our family has been separated in three places. Whenever I see the bright, half-moon night, it really makes me remember Bai Juyi's poem "One night of homesickness in five places at the same time."</p>
<p>War makes people wander, brings people to the brink of despair, and makes people's hearts even more restless and desolate. Whenever I see another group of people coming out of the tragic situation in Northern Jiangsu, I really can't believe that China is still one of the "Five Powers" and that China still has "great citizens."</p>
<p>Slowly, my homesickness has only become disillusionment.</p>
<p>These past two days have been the plum rain season. In the place where I'm staying, the croaking of frogs comes from far and near every evening, as if it were a scene of lying on a rattan mat in my own home, looking up at the Milky Way. But I'm sitting on a bamboo stool borrowed from a neighbor, and next to me is a ruined wall bombed by the enemy eight years ago! Looking into the distance, all I see are dilapidated walls, with no neat houses anywhere. The south wind blows, sometimes carrying a nauseating musty smell. It is said that many young men and women were buried alive by the Japanese devils in the nearby piles of broken tiles. This is a small city that has suffered the most from enemy destruction.</p>
<p>When I see this scene of broken walls and ruins, how can I not feel infinite homesickness for the distant plains of Northern Jiangsu?</p>
<p>Yesterday, I received a letter from my wife. She told me that she was in another city, struggling to survive with two children amidst high prices. She said, "It's so hot, and I have to take care of the two children every step of the way..." She also said, "Six months of exile after the victory feels like adding six more years of suffering from the occupation." Attached to the end of the letter were two lines written by my eight-year-old child. The child wrote, "Daddy, are you doing well outside? Do you miss home, miss the peaches on the peach tree in our garden?"</p>
<p>When I read these two lines, I couldn't help but have tears well up in my eyes. The child's innocent words moved me. Yes, I really miss home. Because of the child's call, I thought of the peach tree in the garden behind my house. It was an improved variety of honey peach transplanted from a farm in Dingjia. For the past four years, it has always been full of fruit in May. The child cherished it and was reluctant to give it away easily, unless it was to his favorite elders and his little friends. But this year, just when the peaches were bearing fruit, we all left the old house where we had lived for nearly thirty years and a small garden.</p>
<p>What words should I pick up my pen to comfort my child with? But in the end I wrote: "Child, we can go home soon. If you want to eat peaches, ask Mom to buy them for you!" I knew that this sentence was a deception to the innocent child. I knew that the flames of war would not be extinguished.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, my heart became even heavier, but I sincerely prayed for the realization of true peace, and a strong longing homesickness surged up again!</p>

<h3>Yearning for Green</h3>
<p>— Hu Shuo</p>
<p>Living in a big city, what I see every day are densely packed, beehive-like skyscrapers, gray cement ground, smoke-like dust mixed with fine coal particles, and the thousands upon thousands of heads of people moving around... What I hear are car horns and the clamor of people. Every morning, leaning by the window of a high-rise building, I open my eyes and look out at the distant sky, wanting to find some green from the distant places to moisten my long-parched soul, but the taller, more gigantic beast-like buildings cruelly cover the eyes of the dream-seeker with gray shadows. The long years pass slowly like a heavy iron wheel, and hope, longing, and yearning are glued to the iron teeth of this wheel, crushed into a bright red streak of blood!...</p>
<p>How tiring is city life! The beast-like buildings, the gray smoke, and the gray cement ground... People can never see that green field. On the outskirts of this city lies the turbid river water, stretching like a belt to the distant horizon, cutting off the traveler's reverie. Living narrowly in the beehive-like buildings every day, cherishing the news of the homeland, yearning for the familiar, boundless green; the lush pines and cypresses, the graceful willows, and the soft fragrant grass. Sometimes my thoughts are disturbed by pain, and occasionally I sneak out of my small room, walk out of the building, and walk alone to the riverbank, standing tall on the shore, hoping to see a pile of clouds from my distant homeland floating in with the evening breeze, but the groaning and sobbing of the river water pulls the traveler back from memory, piercing my soul like many sharp needles!</p>
<p>In the encirclement of loneliness and depression, I spent a series of days, almost every day, and often, I yearned for the green of the distant fields, and for the sake of the yearning for green, in a dim midnight with drizzle falling like dog fur, I quietly wiped away the hot tears that rolled down from the corners of my eyes with a handkerchief.</p>
<p>When I was young, I flew around like a swallow, from this city to that city. Those ten years left a precious page in my life. Every year's vacation was arranged for travelers to change their living environment. When city life became boring, I would flap my wings and start flying again, flying to my homeland and throwing myself into the embrace of the fields, kissing that green land! Lush green, graceful green, soft green... giving me a feeling of peace and tranquility, engraving beautiful and warm lines in the depths of my soul, and drawing a quiet and beautiful picture around me. But I never thought that one day, the green would fade away from my side, leaving behind a trace of blurriness and disappointment.</p>
<p>The torch of war was lit in every corner of the ancient land, and the blood of millions of innocent people converged into a red wave, seeping into the fields of the motherland. The green homeland, like the corners of the north, south, east, and west, disappeared from the side of everyone who yearned for green in the midst of the smell of gunpowder, losing its peaceful, solemn, warm, and quiet beauty. With blurriness and disappointment, I bid farewell to my parents, wife, and children, reluctantly walked out of my old home, stepping on the fragrant grass, passing through the pines and cypresses, and flew to the distance like a swallow again, but from that time on, the swallow's wings became heavy, losing the lightness and agility of youth, and from that time on, leaving my homeland meant several years.</p>
<p>Eight years of turmoil, sleeping in the wind and dew, crossing mountains and wading through water, stumbling in the wind and sand, wandering from one unfamiliar town to another unfamiliar city. The wanderer endured a long series of years wrapped in pain and sorrow, and traveled a desert journey in the dark night.</p>
<p>During this time, I dreamed of silk-colored dreams every day, hoping that one day I could lie in the embrace of the fields, kissing that green chest wildly, washing away her bloody wounds with my sincere tears! Healing her wounds of trampling!</p>
<p>Finally, dawn came, and cries of victory flew everywhere. Facing the morning sun, dragging my tired and heavy steps, the wanderer came to this familiar metropolis again. When I carefully brushed off the dust from my clothes for the first time, I felt an unspeakable joy in my heart. Eight long years have passed, and tears of excitement hung down with a smile. The green memories began to flicker in front of me.</p>
<p>I want to rush to the fields!</p>
<p>But the fog after dawn blocked my eyes, and a storm broke the weary wings of the swallow. A letter from home came from afar, telling me that my old home had been destroyed four years ago, and the story of murder continues to be staged in the fields; that is an even more cruel human tragedy! My family is fine, and all three children are growing up very well, but on the field, which is covered with new and old wounds and faded green, they are living a life that is getting worse and worse, and living more painfully. ...</p>
<p>I don't understand what kind of cruel tragedy is continuing?</p>
<p>Hope was crushed to pieces, and sorrow and pain filled my emotions. Wrapped in deeper wounds, I lifted my steps and left.</p>
<p>The yearning for green gnawed at my soul like a poisonous snake, and my heart was like a yellow, withered leaf. With the erosion of wind and rain, the deep thirst seemed to sink into the mire again.</p>
<p>But, living in the small room of the beehive-like skyscrapers in the city, treading on the gray cement ground, in a ceaseless clamor of noise, where can you find the nourishment of silk green!</p>

<h3>Rice Weevils</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Foreigners invented DDT, but the Chinese have another ingenious use for it: suicide. This is beyond the inventor's expectations. One brother said: Even suicide has to use foreign goods, it's really disheartening!</p>
<p>In all matters, Shanghai people are indeed the first to catch the trend. Having DDT suicide is also fashionable. To date, two such news items have appeared in the newspapers. One has already passed away, and the other only said that he was in critical condition. How the story goes on is still unknown. DDT kills mosquitoes, insects, fleas, and lice, and it turns out that it can also kill people.</p>
<p>Speaking of killing insects, DDT has one unexpected result. It is helpless against one type of insect: the rice weevil.</p>
<p>I have a friend who is particularly interested in biology. In order to test the killing power of DDT, he specially collected bedbugs, mosquitoes, fleas, lice, centipedes, millipedes, crickets, earthworms, rice weevils... various insects, and used DDT to spray them. Under the spraying, all the insects immediately stopped moving, were dying, and gradually died. My friend did not throw them away, but left them there to see what would happen the next day.</p>
<p>The next day, when he went to look again, all the insects were dead, except for the rice weevils, which were wriggling in the corpses of these insects, probably looking for something to eat, and looked particularly energetic. It seemed to be saying: What can you do to me?</p>
<p>This is my friend's report, an absolutely true report. If you don't believe it, fortunately, these two days are the plum rain season, and there are plenty of rice weevils. Everyone can try it out for themselves!</p>
<h3>Also Talking About Inferiority</h3>
<p>— Mo Yu</p>
<p>After reading the articles about "inferiority" in this column the past two days, I couldn't help but think of the "inferiority" felt by subordinates towards superiors. I would like to add something to what Mr. You Ting said:</p>
<p>A person is not born with a sense of inferiority. If you look at young people, nineteen out of ten have the naive energy of a newborn calf who thinks highly of himself. However, this naive energy, after entering society, has to be automatically adjusted and corrected due to various setbacks. Mr. You Ting blames parents in the family for the development of inferiority. In fact, no parents do not deeply love their children and feel comforted when their children can be proud. It's just that the parents, being experienced, know that no level in society allows you to start from "inferiority." Therefore, they cannot help but try to suppress their children from succumbing to "inferiority" through admonishment and guidance. Zeng Guofan's earnest family letters to his children are also his bitter experiences from climbing up to the capital court from the Xiang Army militia. He knew that society only allows inferior people to stand, so even though he was a first-rank official, he still had to learn "inferiority." In his later years, after achieving success, he occasionally satirized Zuo Zongtang in a few casual remarks, and historians wrote about him: "Generous and tolerant, how can you not be ashamed of your virtues." Even if you have contributed greatly to saving the country, you still have to be "inferior," otherwise you will lose your "demeanor" and not understand the principles of being a person!</p>
<p>I remember when I was about to leave school, several former classmates kindly advised me on the secret of using "inferiority" to gain the favor of superiors. After I started working, I always felt that this was invaluable advice. If you are naive and a little憨, you will simply encounter countless hard and soft nails every day. Superiors are all-powerful. Even if they have something they don't understand or are slightly embarrassed about and come to ask you, you must not directly and frankly stand up and accept it. You must be flattered and apprehensive, expressing that you didn't really understand or know how to do it, but you will do your best to be loyal to this matter. After completing the task, you still have to pretend to be sweating profusely but afraid of not being perfect, and ask for instructions. The superior knows that this is deliberately mystifying, but he will definitely appreciate your bowing and subservient inferior expression. You can therefore gain favor, and the superior may even find you to chat and play chess when he has free time. Then you must always pay attention and be inferior everywhere, because an inferior person can highlight how brilliant and knowledgeable your superior is.</p>
<p>I really like the scene of officers in the army punishing soldiers. When the officer shouts, "You muddled-headed bastard!" the soldiers must respond loudly and with chest puffed out: "Yes, Sir!" This is no longer "inferiority," it is loyalty, obedience, and politeness. "Inferiority" has been sublimated here. This kind of inferiority is sincere, not hypocritical, and humane!</p>
<p>People without money and power all have to be inferior. Mr. You Ting says this is a serious psychological illness, but I think it should be said that it is a serious social illness.</p>
<p>Writing to here, I recalled the last time an American private first class visited their Secretary of the Army in Shanghai. The private first class was able to see the Secretary, and the Secretary was able to shake hands with him. Both had the courage to state and listen. I'm really a little envious.</p>
<h3>Electronic Blanket</h3>
<p>— Zhiwei</p>
<p>Many electronic devices have been invented in the field of electronic science. However, those that are convenient for daily life are still few and far between. Recently, Siemens in the United States invented an electronic blanket, which has been successfully tested and will be produced in large quantities. Each blanket costs 40 US dollars. This item was introduced in the spring of 1946. The blanket is divided into two layers, with two intertwined wires in the middle: one to conduct electricity to heat the blanket, and the other to connect to a three-tube temperature regulator to measure the temperature in the blanket and adjust it. If the needle of the regulator points to 78 degrees and the room temperature drops, the temperature-sensing wire can cause a large amount of current to pass through, thereby heating the blanket. If the room temperature increases, the blanket can automatically lower the temperature to the standard 78 degrees. When a person's body temperature drops slightly at night, the blanket can automatically increase the temperature, thus avoiding the trouble of adding blankets due to catching a cold at night. The electronic blanket is very light, so it can make people sleep soundly, and it can also preheat the bed, which is truly good news for those who are afraid of getting into a cold bed in winter.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of this electronic blanket can be proven by the following two tests: 1. If it is illuminated by multiple electric lamps, the heat of the blanket will greatly increase, but through the action of the regulator, it can still maintain the normal temperature of 78 degrees, and the current consumption is only 10 watts. 2. If the blanket is covered with ice, the temperature will greatly decrease, but through the action of the regulator, the temperature inside the blanket will automatically rise to 78 degrees, but the current consumption will reach 198 watts.</p>
<p>Although the electronic blanket uses electric current to heat, it is tightly installed, so there is no danger of electric shock. It is lightweight, comfortable, and unparalleled.</p>
<h3>Freckles and Vitality</h3>
<p>— Zhong Sheng</p>
<p>Many young ladies, when they are very young, will widen their eyes and say to the mirror:</p>
<p>"Oh, how annoying, so many freckles!" This article is written for young ladies with freckles.</p>
<p>Empresses and concubines used morning dew to smear their faces, and old-fashioned beauticians prescribed saltpeter and glycerin. In the era of our mothers, they used rose water mixed with borax and washed in sour milk.</p>
<p>However, modern scientists tell us that freckles are something we should be proud of and take pride in! Dr. Guo Lunhai, a famous Irish gynecologist, said: "Women should not be ashamed of having freckles, they should feel happy. Freckles are a sign of vitality and a kind of sexual attraction." How could Dr. Guo Lunhai know so much about freckles? Here is a peculiar story. Many of Dr. Guo's patients happened to have many freckles, and the children born to women with freckles were always particularly strong and beautiful. He discovered that if a woman stopped childbearing, she would also stop producing freckles. He also noticed that the older a woman got, the fewer freckles she had. Old ladies never have freckles, although when they were young, their faces might have been covered with freckles. Dr. Guo's conclusion is only the beginning of the study of freckles, and now it can be undoubtedly proven. Women with freckles have much more vitality than women with lily-white faces!</p>
<p>Recently, we often hear about a substance extracted from female hormones that can be used to make anti-aging creams. It is sometimes used in high-end cosmetics. This sex hormone can be found in large quantities in the bodies of women with freckles.</p>
<p>It is commonly said that redheads are the most active lovers, but modern science says that what pleases men is not red hair but freckles. The color of a woman's hair, whether silver, gold, or black, is unimportant, contrary to general opinion. What matters most is whether or not they have freckles.</p>
<p>Many people have freckles, but you don't suspect that they do. Some people have freckles, but they are not visible to the naked eye. In ophthalmology, freckles that are not normally visible become fully visible under ultraviolet light or shortwave violet light.</p>
<p>Joan Crawford was a freckled little thing in her youth, and Myrna Loy also had freckles. Katharine Hepburn and Jeanette MacDonald are also like that. Besides, May Valli and Chimay Storwah are also freckled faces. President Roosevelt had freckles, and Mrs. Roosevelt had a freckled face when she was a girl. Mrs. Roosevelt said that this is one of the reasons why she became ugly.</p>
<p>Another strange thing: people who have freckles must have a very rich supply of vitamin C in their tissues. American government scientists set up a test station in Maryland, and the results proved that vitamin C is closely related to sexual energy. They tested cows and bulls, but they believe that men and women are the same. (Translated from the Saturday Family Weekly)</p>

<h3>Don't Be Captured!</h3>
<p>— Huang Jian</p>
<p>"To a captive of love"</p>
<p>XX:</p>
<p>I finished reading the two letters you sent in one breath. From these two different letters, I found that you two grew up in two completely foreign worlds. The bridge of love doesn't seem to be able to connect you. One is a self-proclaimed "Nora" figure, with lofty, arrogant, and conceited intentions, wanting to play well on the stage of life and win a few cheers from the audience; the other is a newborn calf, seeing a green, naive, optimistic, curious, and pure world in front of him, but with some childishness.</p>
<p>From these two different personalities, I can't see the possibility of coordination. If you don't mind me speaking frankly, it's best to get rid of her thoughts as soon as possible.</p>
<p>As she said, we who study engineering should be rich in rationality. We should be able to pick up, put down, and get rid of anything. One of the common problems we often make is: once we fall in love with something, whether it is a person or a thing, we feel that there is nothing better in the world. This is because our knowledge is limited and our vision is narrow. You live at the foot of Nanshan Mountain every day, and what you see every day is limited to the insects, trees, flowers, and birds on Nanshan Mountain. You will naturally feel that all the beauty in the world is in Nanshan Mountain. If you are willing to travel to more places and make more friends, you will not be able to help but laugh at yourself. How inferior your previous tastes seem to be! The things you used to be so fascinated with, when measured by today's standards, are far from the level. Maurois said a word: "Run away from the place that gives you pain, and your pain will slowly heal." So I agree with your idea of running around to different places. First, out of sight, pain can be slowly diluted by time; second, it can also increase a lot of knowledge.</p>
<p>Some stimulation in life is good. With stimulation, inner potential is stimulated. Life should also have some things left undone, and some things that are hung high and cannot be obtained. Only in this way can there be hope and an object of effort. If everything is achieved smoothly, and everything is obtained satisfactorily, the feeling that follows is the disappointment of "but that's all there is to it." Only things that are obtained after struggle taste sweeter and sweeter. The more disappointed and frustrated we are, the more we should seek to be open-minded. Wasn't the young Goethe in love everywhere? However, when he saw his lover sinking like the sun in the west, he turned back to appreciate the rising bright moon in the east. We should learn from Goethe's spirit. Let what is going to be lost go, why mourn the old love with a sad face?</p>
<p>To be honest, she rejects you because she looks down on you for always smiling and not having the masculinity of a husband. There is no reason why she is proud of you. A person who can be proud and dares to be proud must have something extraordinary. Your letter says: "She is becoming more and more active every day, writing editorials for newspapers and articles for various magazines. I am still silently fiddling with my machine." If you are willing to be silent, she will of course not look up to you. Friend, if you feel that you are inferior to her, you don't need to sigh; from today on, you still have time to work hard. It is useless to envy others for making progress while you are not making progress. Only by using your own progress to balance the progress of others can you control things and always be the master, not the slave. Life is most afraid of mediocrity, stagnation, and lack of success. If you can create "surprise" every day, how dare others look down on you? As long as you have achievements, maybe you still have a chance to reconcile. If you can't do it, you will definitely gain a lot of new progress in the process of your efforts and secretly taste the joy of struggle. In the end, your efforts will gain surpassing achievements in other aspects, your taste will change, your vision will become higher, and the wound will have been smoothed over by time. When you look back, look at her who is far behind you, then you will be able to say contentedly, "Look! How am I today?"</p>
<p>Friend, we must live the life of a strong person, we must not be weak! Weakness is a sin, a theft of heaven's nature, and a waste of food for people who are useful to live. In front of people who despise us, we must take action. As long as we seize the present and work hard, then every tomorrow, you will find yourself better than yesterday. "Let the dead past bury its dead." Start from now and work hard!</p>
<h3>A Fishing Story</h3>
<p>— Ting</p>
<p>A London magazine, "The Spectator," published a short essay. The psychological state of the four powers jointly administering Germany can be seen from a story:</p>
<p>"One day, a Soviet, a Frenchman, an American, and an Englishman were visiting a goldfish bowl. While they were enjoying it with great interest, four goldfish suddenly jumped out of the bowl. Seeing this, the Soviet immediately stepped on one of the goldfish and killed it. The Frenchman immediately squatted down, picked up one of them, put it in his bag, and took it home to cook for dinner. The American was completely unmoved and simply ignored it. But what about the Englishman? He picked up the fourth goldfish, very gently wiped off the dust, put it back in the bowl, and then changed the water in the bowl."</p>
<h3>Puyi's Crime</h3>
<p>— Feifei</p>
<p>Puyi, the puppet emperor of the puppet Manchukuo, has reportedly completed the extradition procedures and is scheduled to be transported from Vladivostok to Shanghai around the 20th of this month, and then escorted from Shanghai to Beijing by military aircraft to be tried as an important war criminal.</p>
<p>Puyi was a puppet emperor in the Northeast for 14 years. For 14 years, he always followed the lead of the enemy chiefs Hirohito and the Kwantung Army, placing the people of the Northeast in dire straits. Under the policy of enslavement education, young people around the age of 20 would not know their motherland, and children around the age of 10 had never seen rice. It was against the law for Chinese people in the Northeast to eat rice.</p>
<p>If they were occasionally caught stealing rice, the punishment they received was more severe than that of Shanghai people smoking opium; but Japanese people eating rice was not subject to this rule, because they were conquerors. There was only one way for Chinese people to be free from interference by the invaders, and that was to sell opium and smoke opium.</p>
<p>Although Puyi was a puppet emperor, he was the number one puppet of the puppet Manchukuo. For example, in the palace, he could only smoke Japanese cigarettes. The Japanese warlords forbade him to smoke the British and American Three Five brand cigarettes. He and the Japanese warlords still colluded and acted as accomplices in many important tasks.</p>
<p>If a public opinion survey were conducted in the Northeast today, asking the people of the Northeast for their opinions on the disposal of Puyi, all the people of the Northeast might ask the government to execute Puyi by slicing or beheading him; because Puyi and the Japanese warlords used this method to deal with the volunteer army in the Northeast in the past. If we use their methods to treat them in turn, Puyi would certainly deserve it. Unfortunately, China no longer has this kind of punishment.</p>
<p>The execution of the puppet emperor is an inevitable matter sooner or later. I will first use this article to mourn the puppet emperor!</p>

<h3>Sent to My Deceased Wife, Fengjun (3)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>One day, the beloved daughter of Brother Xiaoqing, Yu Zhen, who works in Shanghai, returned to Suzhou for some business, and she and her mother came to the hospital to visit you. Miss Yu Zhen is a devout Christian, so she earnestly persuaded you to believe in Christ, saying that only Christ can cure your illness and save your life. I had not yet arrived at the hospital at that time, and you were unwilling to make your own decision, saying that you needed my consent. Alas, Feng, you are too stubborn! If Christ could really cure your illness and save your life, would I disagree? So as soon as I arrived at the hospital, after hearing about this, I immediately agreed to believe in Christianity, and even made a vow that after I had buried my old mother, who had believed in Buddhism all her life, I would follow you and become a follower of Christ. What a good Miss Yu Zhen, she was busy kneeling down to pray for you, which moved me very much. Afterwards, I often used Christ to encourage you to maintain your faith, believing that Christ would definitely protect you. However, half a month later, Dr. Huang said that injecting air was not very effective, so it was better to go home and recuperate. I couldn't help but feel secretly disappointed when I heard this, but you looked happy, because on the one hand, you couldn't bear the pain of the injections, and on the other hand, you were eager to go home, thinking that the hospital was not as comfortable as home. I had no choice but to pay the bill and accompany you home with a heavy heart.</p>
<p>After returning home, I still asked Dr. Wu to come every other day to give you those three kinds of injections. I heard that the mixed vitamin from Parke, Davis &amp; Company in the United States was very beneficial to the sick body, so I wrote a express letter to Zheng'er in Shanghai to buy a hundred pills and take one or two doses every day. And I kept buying oranges, milk powder, and other nutritious things for you to eat. I knew that you had always been frugal, so I earnestly advised you not to worry about my source of income. I had plenty of money on hand, and you could buy whatever you wanted. You wanted to eat candied dates, you wanted to eat raisins, you wanted to eat pickled vegetables. I searched all over Guanqian Street and managed to buy them. I brought them back excitedly and put them in your hands, but you only ate two candied dates, a few raisins, and said they were too sweet and greasy. After eating a piece of pickled vegetable, you said it was too salty and spicy, and put them all aside. I watched you at every meal and always advised you to eat more. You smiled bitterly and never wanted to eat more, but you couldn't eat it. Probably the amount you were going to eat in this life was almost full? I stopped you from saying these unlucky words, and you stopped talking. Poor me, I tried every means to make you have enough nutrition, to use it as a weapon to resist the disease; however, whether it was giving you eggs, soy milk, or beef juice, you always didn't want to eat any more after a few days. Even other things you loved to eat, such as shrimp, abalone, white chicken, and sauced duck, you often tasted only a little and stopped. You frowned and said, "I don't know what has blocked my appetite. Why don't I feel much flavor in anything I eat?"</p>
<p>You have always loved cleanliness. When you were in Shanghai, although you went in and out of the kitchen, you were still neatly dressed. Now, even though you are sick, you still want to maintain your clean state. Although you have no strength yourself, you always have to struggle to get up every morning, ask Aunt Bao to comb your hair, make the bed, and tidy up the bedding. Taking this opportunity, I would help you to the corridor and lean on the rattan chair for half an hour to absorb some fresh air and indirectly get some sunlight. When you were in the mood, I had to help you to see the thriving flowers and trees, and you were willing and happy to do so.</p>
<p>The tenth day of the third lunar month was your 50th birthday. My children and I all valued this day very much. We planned to celebrate it for you and hoped that after this day, your health would improve day by day. The day before, Zheng'er really came back from Shanghai with your four sisters, Ling, Mei, Xing, and Ying, your cousin Zhao Xi, Mei's son Xin Tai, Xing's husband Junqing, and son Pingsheng, a total of nine people. Only your daughter-in-law Yundai was six months pregnant and about to give birth, and Mei's husband Jingren was busy with his clinic, so they couldn't come. You watched all your children sincerely return to wish you a happy birthday, and they all offered gifts, clothes and food, piled on your bed, which made you so happy that you shed tears. The next morning, we all mobilized to decorate the hall, hanging a large longevity character painted with meticulous brushwork of flowers and plants in the middle, offering copper candlesticks, copper incense burners, and a new type of candlestick that could hold seven candles. The gardener presented a large red candle and longevity incense, and lit them all together with the seven red candles. In the center of the table, there were longevity noodles presented by Ms. Xu Xiuzhen of Jinghai Women's Normal School and a longevity cake that your daughter-in-law asked Zheng'er to present on her behalf. On the long offering tables on both sides, there were antique bronzes, which actually looked like a hall. In order to show solemnity, I had asked Su You to order a table of shark fin soup a few days ago. At noon, the whole family sat around the round table and invited Ms. Xu to participate, which was really full of joy. You sat in the middle, and your eyebrows also showed a very happy expression. This meal was very rich. Although you couldn't eat much, I insisted that you try everything, and I also brought the homemade rose flower wine to the table, and you reluctantly took a sip. Everyone looked at it and was very excited. You didn't want to spoil our fun, and only went to bed to rest after the meal was over. In the afternoon, you still ate noodles and cake as usual, and you ate some too. Although this birthday did not alarm friends, it was considered to have fully fulfilled the two words "family celebration." However, because you were sick yourself, you did not allow anyone to bow to you, which made your children feel sorry for you.</p>
<h3>Curfew and Martial Law</h3>
<p>— Hong Yin</p>
<p>After the curfew was lifted, the authorities declared that martial law would not be lifted. Many people are confused, asking what the difference is between the two.</p>
<p>Actually, it's very simple: a curfew specifically refers to the prohibition of movement at night (in Shanghai, it begins after midnight). It is one of the means of implementing martial law. As for a martial law order, it can be declared at any time depending on the actual needs, because it is not limited to nighttime alone.</p>
