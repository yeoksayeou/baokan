<h3>和平之門更見敞開　政府準備隨時停戰　主席主先召開三五人會</h3>
<p>〔合眾社南京十四日電〕立法院院長孫科政協秘書長邵力子，今日稱：政府願發出停戰命令。據孫院長稱，並重行召開政協綜合小組與憲草審查小組，惟有若干條件，如共產黨亦發出停戰命令，周恩來返歸南京參加三人會以處理各項技術問題，則政府即可將停戰命令發出。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕孫院長科十三日自滬返京後，與政府方面代表對國是所集議之意見，於十四日午主席召見時業已面陳，並得主席同意，該項意見即於今晚由政協秘書長雷震專車赴滬轉達各黨派，時局有無轉機，當視滬方反應如何，一二日內，當可定奪，主席十四午在官邸召見者，有孫科，邵力子，吳鐵城，王世杰，陳布雷，陳立夫，張厲生，吳鼎昌，雷震諸氏，由孫科報告在滬與各黨派接見情形及所提意見，幷陳述昨日會商結果，主席聆悉報告後，即指示一切，復於下午五時再度召見雷震有所指示，本報記者下午八時特定訪孫院長於其私邸，承發表談話如下：「本人此次在滬，曾與各黨派人士接見，各方提供意見甚多，旋以本月十一日國軍進駐張家口，次日宣佈國大召集令，使若干人士認爲政府方面業已關閉和平之門，無法再行商談，本人返京即以此向政府加以說明，並候政府方面表示意見，上海方面看法，實不盡正確，國大召集令雖已發出，但現距開會時期尚有二十餘日如可商談，未嘗來不及，目前亟待商談者，不外：一，停止軍事衝突，二，政府改組，三，大家參加國民大會，四，憲草修正案問題。茲分別說明如次：第一，政府對於停止軍事衝突，不但願意商談且願越提早越好，但停戰爲雙方之事，以往雙方亦曾有協議下過停戰令，但仍無法維持，至軍事衝突，仍不能避免，因此目前必須求得澈底停戰辦法，雙方商談妥定成立協議，雙方遵守始能一勞永逸，因此爲商討停戰問題，故必須立刻召開軍事三人會議，使停戰早日實施。</p>
<p>盼周恩來返京　即行參加商談</p>
<p>並盼周恩來即來京出席參加商談；第二，政府改組一事，曾經司徒大使建議召開非正式五人小組，專討論改組政府問題，建議提出時周恩來即曾表示同意，後卒告停頓，現在應使其實現，俟獲得協議再召開政協綜合小組，如此即可依次解決參加國大及提交名單之事；第三，國大召開目的，在於制憲，政協憲草審議會自二月初迄今隨時集會研究，全部憲草已研討完畢，然在還都以前，中共對此事曾加申明，憲草即使經過審查程序仍須全部保留，政府亦表同意，故目前雖已研討完畢，因未經雙方協議，不能成立，以是目前應即召開憲草審議會繼續未了任務，並提交立法院完成立法程序，再交國民大會制定。孫氏繼稱，軍事上最重要者，爲停戰，整編，統編諸事，則必須召開軍事三人小組協商，政治方面，五人小組商討政府改組，一有協議，政府即可實行改組，如能在國大開會前一切獲得協議則國大即可改組後之新政府下舉行，最後孫氏加重語氣稱，和平之門不但未關閉，且更加敞開，希望共產黨民盟及各黨派早日返京，進行各小組會議，本人此次返京，向政府所陳述者，即爲上述各點，各黨必須依照此種步驟進行，始可求得全部問題之解決，本人認爲前途很有希望，記者旋辭出，據悉此項意見，已獲主席同意。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕和談停頓中馬司兩使甚少活動，十四日下午二時半英大使施諦文曾訪司使，談近一小時，旋司使即出訪蘇大使彼得羅夫，一小時後，又赴外部訪王外長，並再訪馬特使，至七時始返，司使定十八日赴杭一行廿一日返京，傳經波將同行。</p>
<h3>雷震來滬之使命　將訪晤各黨代表</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十四日電〕政協秘書長雷震，今晚搭車赴滬，據悉：雷氏此去將訪晤在滬各黨派代表，就目前時局問題交換意見</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕張家口克復後，上海中共方面始終保持沉默，然眾信和平之門，仍未關閉。青年黨領袖李璜自京返滬後，前日深夜曾於海格路青年黨總部邀集第三方面留滬各領袖，舉行會談，當時黃炎培因病，錢新之因足疾夜間向不外出，郭沫若因遠在虹口不及趕到，皆未參加，故出席者僅青年黨曾琦·陳啟天·左舜生·楊永浚·李璜；民盟羅隆基·張君勵·沈鈞儒·梁漱溟·章伯鈞等。席間李璜曾有報告。而昨晨政府方面各政協代表，亦曾在京有所會談，並曾將會談經過，報告主席，而政協秘書長雷震，即於昨日午後，趕至上海，夜十時並訪左舜生商談，一般人士觀察，雷氏必已將政府方面政協代表之決議，通知上海第三方面。</p>
<p>據參加歷次會談之第三方面某政協代表稱：如此後政府不願第三方面是否加入，逕行如期召開國大，或中共逕即退出談判，發動游擊戰爭，則即爲兩方本身着想，亦非解決問題之妥善辦法。反之，若能適可而止，先行召開政協小組，則第三方面當無拒不參加之理，蓋政協法議案曾經各黨派之三十八代表共同簽字，各昭信守，除此之外，實無其他途徑，可供遵循也。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕市黨部方主任委員宣誓後，昨午偕書記長謝仁釗，委員陳驊首次拜訪在滬各黨派領袖，與周恩來氏晤談並敦促早日晋京，商討和平大計同時分訪左舜生·張君勵·曾琦·沈鈞儒·章伯鈞諸氏，希望促成和平團結共同參加國大。</p>
<h3>中共代表團否認將離京</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕梁漱溟十四日上午訪雷震，對報載共產黨登記民盟失業員工表示抗議。下午七時半訪莫德惠長談，莫有赴滬說，共產黨代表團十四日無活動，發言人僅作以下兩點之申明：一，否認共產黨辦事處有撤離南京之說，二，否認共產黨宣佈主動的全面破裂。</p>
<h3>史迪威遺體將舉行火葬</h3>
<p>骨灰將散布太平洋</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約十三日電〕今日紐約各報俱以首頁顯著地位，刊載史迪威死訊。史氏因肝病入醫院治療，施行手術，若干日後情形日趨惡化，卒於昨日溘然長逝。各方將依照史氏願望，不舉行公共議式，其遺體將舉行火葬，骨灰由飛機散布於家鄉附近太平洋中。</p>
<p>宋院長唁電　[中央社青島十四日電]宋院長子文養疴青市，頃聞史迪威將軍病逝，甚爲悼惜，特電史將軍夫人致唁。電云：史迪威夫人禮鑒，驚聞史將軍逝世，不勝悼惜，史將軍在中國之功績，中國人民永不忘懷。</p>
<h3>中美商約定稿</h3>
<p>政院今決定簽訂期</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕中美商約經研商多日，業已定稿，九日國防最高委會開會時，曾提付討論，大體已獲通過。十五日政院會議即可決定簽訂日期，據聞如不再需修正，日內即可正式簽訂。</p>
<h3>國府昨日明令發表察綏兩省府改組　傅作義董其武分任主席</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十四日電〕國府十五日令：（一）察哈爾省府委員兼主席馮欽哉，綏遠省府委員兼主席傅作義，另有任用，均應免本兼各職。（二）任命傅作義爲察哈爾省府委員。（三）任命傅作義兼察省府主席。（四）任命董其武爲綏遠省府委員。（五）任命董其武兼綏遠省府主席。據關係方面消息，察哈爾省政府主席馮欽哉，已奉令調爲第十二戰區副司令長官。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十四日電〕馮欽哉十四日晨偕秘書長宋雲峯，教育廳長胡子垣及其他各廳處職員五十餘人，乘汽車赴懷來，定十五日到張家口，省府即日起在張家口辦公。</p>
<h3>洪蘭友訪晤俞大維　商空運國大代表　記者將列入被招待部分</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕國大籌備會秘書長洪蘭友，日來對大會之事務籌備事項極形忙碌，十三日曾竟日開會討論，十四晚洪語記者，大會新聞組工作，即交由中宣部辦理，對於記者列席旁聽均將由新聞組負責辦理，至原定記者席一百二十座，現決予擴充，以免有向隅之事。洪並稱：此次大會，記者將列入被招待部份，雖不能與代表同樣待遇，但可享受相等便利，使記者在會塲之地位可與若干國際性會議旁聽之記者地位相埒，並在會塲旁特設記者休息室，各大報出席記者每單位決不衹一席，至會塲布置月杪可全部完成屆時當招待記者參觀，並報告一切籌委會於月前結束，大會開幕即交大會秘書處辦理。又各地代表來京交通問題，洪十四晨曾與俞交長商討，可無問題，空運除中國·中央兩公司外，空運大隊亦可予協助，各地代表集中地點及時間，即可公布，每省集中地約有三處，江蘇爲徐州·鎮江·上海。又今日已對各代表發出通知，準備集中。至國大名單問題，洪稱：十五日可由國府正式公布一部份，各黨派名單，仍在催請中。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕國大如期召集令頒佈後各黨派態度未完全明瞭，和平商話前途亦尚未見明朗，記者頃詢某權威方面，據談，政府對於國大如期召集，已屬絕對堅確，仍盼各黨派如期參加，關於此事日來正在協談之中，或有相當結果，倘竟不能如期齊集，好在會期甚長，儘可隨時參加，幷謂和平商談各方尚在努力，政府方面爲國忍認，在政治方面預料將有讓步可能，倘共方以國家爲重，自不致趨於極端。</p>
<h3>平古綫激戰</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十四日電〕平古綫懷柔，密雲間之統軍莊，昨夜起被襲擊，十四日上午在激戰中。</p>
<h3>平漢北段沉靜</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十四日電〕察省大戰告終之時，平漢路北段呈現劇勸前夕之沉靜，國軍兵力漸加強，共軍則按兵不動，兩軍似皆在準備中。昨晚涿縣南方鐵路被破壞一段，南下車通涿縣，由石家莊北開車，十四日已通至定縣，但新樂鐵橋須徒步聯絡。</p>
<h3>陝北綏德共軍　進襲榆林邊境　擾歸綏舊城共軍撲滅</h3>
<p>〔本報天津十四日電〕陝北共軍綏德警備司令吳貸峯，近率部二萬餘人侵襲榆林邊境，分向距榆林一三〇里之鎮川堡及武鎮，橫山等地進犯，國軍迎阻，十三日起已發生戰鬥，眾信共軍圖攻佔榆林，榆林軍事當局正妥籌防範。</p>
<p>〔中央社歸綏十三日電〕歸綏舊城西南角，十三晚九時有共軍小股竄擾，當即撲滅。</p>
<h3>興化城內聞槍聲　殘餘共軍隨時準備撤退</h3>
<p>〔本報泰縣十四日電〕據興化來人談：十二日起，興化城內已不時聽到前綫之斷續機槍聲。</p>
<p>〔本報泰縣十四日電〕據悉，興化縣殘餘共軍已作退計，各個士兵之行裝，均已收拾妥當，隨時可以開拔，夜間睡眠則強借民間之宿舍。</p>
<p>〔本報泰縣十四日電〕興化縣之收復，僅剩時間問題，流亡此間之該縣縣政府，日來工作緊張異常，準備入境。</p>
<h3>運河兩岸國軍已會師汜水鎮</h3>
<p>〔中央社淮陰十三日電〕蘇北運河沿岸南北兩端，國軍十二日已在高郵，憲應中間之汜水鎮（界首以北）會師，十三日已有漣水難民數人自揚州循陸路北來，行抵淮陰，此間估計，此路一通，鏖集京，滬，鎮，揚各地之難民，首批將有四萬餘人於短期內重返家園，故當前救濟工作，實需各方全力合作。淮陰專署宣布，即淮陰，淮安，漣水，阜寗，宿遷，泗陽六縣流亡人口，總數已有一百零四萬人。</p>
<h3>膠濟沿綫休戰</h3>
<p>蘇北共軍退回魯境</p>
<p>〔本報濟南十三日電〕膠濟路沿綫已轉入暫時休戰狀況，膠東共軍雖已退離交通綫，仍有二三萬人，留據高密南，北八公里至十二公里地區，有隨時再度發動戰事之企圖。膠濟路沿綫交通，現完全入於國軍掌握中，下月中旬濟南，青島間汽車可直達，但火車全通則須在新年左右。魯西南一帶國軍收復區域，地方秩序已大部安定，共軍冀魯豫軍區楊勇全部三四萬人，已退出魯西南，集結於魯西北范縣，壽張，陽　一帶，準備抵抗北上之國軍。至赴蘇北作戰之新四軍，亦漸次退回山東，其第一師日前過臨沂北開，已抵沂水一帶，似在補充調整之中，將來企圖尚難判定。</p>
<h3>孫連仲長官由前綫返平</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十四日電〕十一戰區長官孫連仲，連日往返於前綫北平間，倍極勞碌，昨晚自前綫返來，兩足泥濘，未稍休息，即赴陳總長處報告。據熟悉此次察省戰役之某氏談：共軍之最大失敗，在於不悉戰略，僅顧正面，忽略背後空虛，招致傅作義部隊以神速進軍，由北方一鼓而下。張垣，懷來戰綫，共軍正面堵擊雖力，而國軍左右兩翼包抄，越過懷來，一鼓而入下花園，形成一大包圍，此包圍圈內之共軍，不下三萬餘人，潰滅者當在半數以上，此又共軍一大失策。共軍原計劃分兵一支截斷平漢路，進而威脅平津，以收牽制之效，結果僅在平漢路小有擾亂，而未敢進窺平津，此計劃亦歸失敗。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十四日電〕陳總長誠十四日仍留平，一度外出視察，原定十五日離平返京，可能因指辦之公事趕辦不及延遲一日。</p>
<h3>北寗綫遭破壞　昨日行軍全停</h3>
<p>〔本報天津十四日電〕北寗綫十三晚至十四晨間，有七外遭共軍大肆破壞，津榆段十四日行車全停。遭破壞處計：（一）平津途中安定，萬莊間，電桿被砍十二根。（二）津榆間新河，北塘途中六號橋被炸毀。（三）北塘金溪河間十號橋全部被炸。（四）田莊唐坊間路軌被炸四根。（五）唐山開平間三一二四次壓道車，十三日晚於二七六公里處遇雷，機車及空車四輛出軌。（六）石門安山間路軌被拆三公里，並移去鋼軌十餘根，林木三千根，電桿亦被毀甚多。（七）安山後封台間，被拆走鋼軌三根，路局正分別搶修，十五日可望通車</p>
<h3>安東方面國軍　昨進駐柳河縣</h3>
<p>〔中央社　陽十四日電〕安東方面梅河口以南之柳河縣，十四日上午九時爲國軍進駐，原在該地共軍向通化潰退。</p>
<h3>傅作義飛張視察　入察國軍已有數路會師　共軍對大同又採新攻勢</h3>
<p>〔本報歸綏十四日電〕傅作義長官，十四日下午二時專機飛張家口視察。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十四日電〕關係方面稱：察東國軍傅作義與孫連仲兩部，昨晚會師於宣化東方，但據十二戰區消息，宣化與下花園間尚有據點未克復，故兩軍之會師或在十四日晚。另息，收復懷來，下花園之國軍，已分兵一路向南追擊中，涿鹿即可收復。收復多倫之杜聿明部，昨已兼程趕到張垣，與傅作義部會師。又由張垣西進之傅部傳已迫柴溝堡，即將與自平綏西段東進之另一部在該方面會師。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平十四日電〕平綏綫國軍，十三日完全收復懷來後，懷來·延慶一帶共軍，一部竄入懷來以北，延慶以西之山地，其主力則竄懷來西南之　山堡一帶，國軍已過土木堡桑園西進。</p>
<p>〔本報歸綏十三日電〕張垣近郊共軍，已經孔家莊左衛城間向蔚縣潰退，市內電燈自來水公司及清河橋重要建築，均行澈底破壞，車站僅有貨車一輛，距城十五里許之兩處機塲亦被破壞，經工兵搶修，十三日已有飛機降落。商都投誠之共軍保安大隊，自動組織肅奸團，將共方七個區的行政組織搗毀，又巫雲共軍縣長魯平，近帶共軍二百人在涼城廠汗營慘殺響應國軍之人民，晋綏邊境已成恐怖世界。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十四日電〕平綏路東段之搶修工作，正於軍隊掩護下積極進行中，十四日已修至青龍橋西方之西撥子。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社南京十四日電〕據可靠消息，中共軍又向大同進攻，大同西北兩市鎮已入共軍之手，預料不久將發生激戰，大批國軍已自晋南兼程北上增援，以解大同之圍。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京十四日電〕共軍又自大同之北及西北，向該城進攻，共方雖稱大同又陷於孤立，然國防部發言人則謂，共軍對大同之新攻勢，並非嚴重之威脅，蓋晋北該段共軍之兵力，實不逾五千人也。</p>
<h3>晋北共軍調動頻繁</h3>

<h3>白部長報告整軍　聲明不欲消滅共黨軍隊　盼勿割據地盤阻礙和平</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十四日電〕中樞紀念週十四日晨九時舉行，蔣主席親臨領導行禮，國防部白部長崇禧，出席報告軍事，白氏首述抗戰勝利後，整編軍隊情形，渠稱，整軍建軍之目的，乃在建立現代化之陸海空軍，保衛國土，隴海以南之整編工作，業已進行，隴海以北軍隊，亦本應整編，但不幸共軍不遵屢次停戰協定，稱兵作亂，甚至進攻南通，幾至威脅京滬，政府爲保衛地方，保護人民，故有蘇北之戰。白氏繼報告隴海，膠濟，同蒲，平津各綫軍事情形，繼稱，全國將士，在蔣主席德威及陳參謀總長指揮之下，不得已而用兵，但最後目的，終要和平統一，並實行軍隊國家化，不容任何一人或一黨派有其軍隊，故就軍事上言，吾人並不欲消滅共黨軍隊，只希望共軍整編爲國家軍隊，不割據地盤，與阻止恢復交通工作，早實現和平統一，建立三民主義之新國家。</p>

<h3>美應助蔣主席　成立聯合政府</h3>
<p>紐約時報之評論</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約十三日電〕紐約時報本日撰論稱，共產黨之喪失張垣，爲自戰爭結束以來最慘重之失敗，美國應充分援助蔣主席成立一種可以實現之聯合政府，馬歇爾將不回國，美國亦不撤退駐華之少數軍隊，吾人可以同時亦必須希望獲得某種中國式保全「面子」之折衷方案，最大之困難，爲混合兩種相反之理想，於一個民主政府之中，雙方之政治理想，雖有甚大距離，然蔣主席實居於二黨之上，渠已作若干讓步，誠心成立一種可以實現之聯合政府。</p>

<h3>美英蘇波茨坦協定秘密部份應公布　美對華政策協會之要求</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十三日電〕美國對華政策協會，十三日由司庫柯爾柏發表函件一通，請求杜魯門總統將所傳「有關中國之波茨坦秘密協定」予以公開宣布。該協會謂此次協定之存在，「已由國務院向本會證實」。惟國務院官方否認此點。柯氏將該協會與國務院之往來函件予以發表，以證明史達林，杜魯門及艾德禮，在一九四五年第三次波茨坦會議時所訂有關山國之秘、密協定。據該函件透露：美國對華政策協會曾於致　國務卿艾古遜之函件中。指摘該項波茨坦秘密協定訂有下列各項：（一）外蒙古脫離中國，此舉違反雅爾達秘密協定之條款。（二）朝鮮之分割，（三）自中國東北給與蘇聯以額外賠償，（四）强迫中國政府接納中共組織聯合政府，而不解散或合併中共原有之軍隊，（五）倘美國不能迫使中國執行第一三四各項，則蘇聯將向由行動，單獨負責」。國務院中國科對於上述特殊條款加以否認，指其「毫無專實根據」，但並不切實否認某種秘密協定之存在。根據柯爾柏所透露之函件，渠曾於九月十三日及廿六日兩度致函國務院稱：根據國務院覆函，認爲足以證明波茨坦會議中確有有關中國之秘密協定。渠詢問國務院此種解釋是否錯誤，國務院迄未作覆。然今日據與此事有關之國務院負責官員告記者稱：波茨坦會議中「並未成立有關中國之協定」，同時，國務院亦不擬再將此意通知該協會。</p>

<h3>我鎢砂產量　正力謀增加</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕鎢砂出產，一我國最多而質地最佳，記者頃據一資源委員會國外貿所所負責人稱一：我國鎢砂產量正逐謀增加中，勝利一年來，因政局動　，物價不穩定，致產量未較戰前增加，因鎢砂爲重工業中重要五金屬之一種，故政府自戰前迄今一向予以管制，商民不得自由運輸，其售銷槪由國外貿易所主持，爲我國在國際貿易市塲之重要出口之一，故產鎢　區礦廠均係國營，鎢砂本可精　後輸出，因成本昻貴，故僅以鎢砂輸出，運銷英·美·蘇聯等國，此外鋅之產銷亦爲國有，不准自由買賣，我國對銻之冶煉爛技術已頗優良，可冶煉至百分之九九·九，普通各國煉銻僅至百分之九九·七五，故從技術方面講，我國已不較外國遜色，祇須整個國家經濟穩定後，此項稀有金屬之產銷，對國家收入不無相當裨益也。</p>

<p>據張氏對記者談，我國經濟建設問題，必須把握兩點：（一）國民所得平均，（二）國際收支平衡。平均國民所得之方法，無論動產及不動產，宜採取一人一名，一名一戶制度。此外戶口方面應實施科學方法，切實調查統計。至平衡國際收支，當前對策爲（一）獎勵出口，（二）提倡節約，（三）减少消耗。然國貨與洋貨無論在品質上成木上終不能拮抗，其餘解救途徑莫若速謀幣制穩定，銀行利率减低，他如吸引工業機器進口，促進土產亦爲要圖。換言之，生產工具不厭多，消耗物品不嫌其缺，再者我國國貨商除內銷外，更應注意南洋市塲，在日本工業未復興前，先行爭取地位云。</p>

<h3>所期望滬市黨部者</h3>
<p>中國國民黨上海市黨部主任委員方治氏暨新任各委員，昨最舉行宣誓就職典禮於上海市體育館，同時滬市各界舉行擴大總理紀念週，自中央監誓員吳敬恒氏以次，各有致詞。而方主任委員更明白宣告，將以政黨作風完成革命的止的，以革命精神實現黨的主義，尤足使本市的黨員認清他們今後應該努力的路綫。昨日參加典禮者不下五六百人，報獲有一種新印象，以爲國民黨的作風，勢將爲之一變。</p>
<p>本來，國民黨黨員乃信奉三民主義而堅決奮鬥之一羣人。他們如以「爲民前鋒」爲職志，則應站在民衆前面引導；他們如信「人生以服務爲目的」，則應不求名，不求利，埋頭苦幹，爲民衆服務。無論抱那一種觀念，黨員必須與民衆親近，而黨部更必須爲黨員之家庭。主持黨務者，萬不可祇視黨部火門以內若干工作人員爲其幹部，而應看所有黨員均爲其一切工作之幹部；不僅此也，黨旣站在民衆前面，爲民衆服務，則黨的工作應該即是民衆所迫切需要的工作，換言之，黨所要做的，即是民衆所要做的，則民衆亦應即是黨的一切工作之幹部。</p>
<p>上海市黨部今後果能樹立新的作風，鼓舞全市的黨員，乃至激勵全市的民衆，不狹隘，不偏私，一切以民之所好好之，民之所惡惡之爲準則，而勇往　　，則我們敢信全市的黨員乃至全市的民衆必均樂爲之用，而黨的人才不可勝用了。我們所期望於上海市黨部者，莫大於此。</p>
<h3>法國新憲法的完成</h3>
<p>法國制憲會議，於上月廿九日，通過的法國憲法草案，已於前天提交公民投票表決，本部各省陸續開票的結果，截至作者執筆爲止，人民投票贊成新憲草者九，一四三，三一〇票，投反對票者，亦有八，〇八四，〇六七票。法國新憲草草必能獲得公民投票通過，已是不成問題的了。這次公民投票的結果，不僅可使戰後法國的臨時政體得告一段落，而且可以決定法國政治的形態，以致影響及整個歐洲政局的演變，所以世人對於這交法國的公民投票，都子以密切的注視。</p>
<p>法國自獲得解放以來，一直保持着臨時政體的形態。法國政治家雖然盡極大的努力，制成了一部最新頴的最民卞的憲法，但在本年五月五日提付公民投票表決，終究被推翻了。以致今日，法國元首還稱爲臨時總統。但是最近幾個月來，法國不論在內政上或外交上，存在着許多亟待解決的問題；因此一般民衆，莫不渴望臨時政體早日結束，而得走上憲政的常軌，使這些問題易於解決。所以法國三大政黨（即天主敎進步黨，社會黨和共產黨）的領袖，在制憲會議中，極盡妥協的能事，終於另外制定了一部新憲草，交付公民投票表示，以視民意的向背；同時三大政黨的領袖，並指示各黨的黨員及羣衆，一致擁護這個新憲草。論理這個新憲草獲得公民投票的通過，本是不成問題的；但是在舉行公民投票的前夕，抗戰英雄戴高樂將軍，却在各地發表演說，攻擊這部新憲草，並籲請公民投票反對，當能左右一部份公民的意見，尤其是天主教　步黨的份子。因此世人對於這部新憲草的命運，能否爲一般公民所接受，又不敢過份樂觀了。</p>
<p>戴高樂將軍因有領導抗戰的功績，在一般法國人民的心目之中，有着不可動搖的地位，據測騐法國民意的結果，擁護戴氏爲領袖的佔百分之三十五，爲任何政黨領袖所不及。惟在今日的法國，因在大戰期間備受德國的蹂躪與摧殘，元氣斵傷，迄未恢復，故自解放到現在，饑荒的迫切，物資的匱乏，交通的阻塞，物價的飛漲，以及社會的不安，在在都是非常嚴重的問題；再加以國際形勢的未能改善，締造世界和平之不易，英美集團與斯拉夫集團的對峙，法國究將往何處去，更是不易解決的問題，戴高樂雖有軍事的戰略和領導的天天，但是有無政治外交家的手段，不是沒有問題的。這些現公民投票情形，暴露無遺。第一是公民棄權的衆多，幾　百分之三十。法國公民投票的不踴躍，足以說明法國人民對於政治的苦悶，在左右兩派鬥爭的夾縫裏，深感無所適從的痛苦。第二一是贊成與反對的相差無幾，由此也可以知道載高樂在民間的地位，是不可輕視的。今後戴高樂將軍如仍從事政爭運動，則法國的政潮，勢將方興未艾，使我們對於法國政治的前途，實在不能不採取若干保留態度。</p>
<p>法國新憲草的條款款，尚未公佈，其內容如何？羅然還不十分明瞭；但是這部新實草，是法國三大政黨妥協的結果。各方意見的紛歧，在憲草中，已縮到最小限度，所以不顧戴高樂的反對，仍能獲得公民多數通過，是決非偶然的。在黨派之間，能以和平商談的方式，解決政治上所有一切的爭議，最後卒能成立協議，完成成一部新憲草，再由公民投票通過，使法國的政治，從臨時政體走上憲政的常軌，這一個好榜樣，在今日實在値得我們的參考。</p>
<h3>漫談物價管制</h3>
<p>物價管制的目的有二：一爲物價的平穩，一爲分配的合理要達到第一目的，第一，全部物資，須把握得住；第二，須把生產機構加以充分地和不斷地運用着。</p>
<p>要達到第二目的，第一，須查明消費的對象；第二，須健全分配的機構；第三，須且有充分的權力。</p>
<p>假如上述的前提不誤，那末，不脫下列的情形和用意時，實際辦不到眞正的管制：</p>
<p>（一）平價其名，賺錢其實。始終和黑市賽跑的；</p>
<p>（二）分配的對象，是手中現存的物資，不是對方適用的需要；</p>
<p>（三）物資太少，不足以供需要；</p>
<p>（四）物資統一不住，配售以外，還有自由市塲；</p>
<p>（五）只管配銷，不管生產，以致產銷脫了節，來源發生問題”或產價和配價無法配合；</p>
<p>（六）配貨無法管束，紛紛流入黑市；</p>
<p>（七）消費的對象，沒有弄得淸楚，以至配非其人，或配非所用；</p>
<p>（八）人事不健全，事權不統一，管制的本身，即發生了問題；</p>
<p>（九）經濟無界限，而管制壓力；卻局於一隅；</p>
<p>（十）根本並無管制的決心和準備，不過迫於當前的情勢，聊以塗飾耳目的；</p>
<p>（十一）或是假借管制的名義，來實行某種壟斷企圖的。</p>
<p>現在管制的機構，日益加多了，論其性質，有由中央辦理的，也有地方辦理的，又有半官半商辦理的。但上面所舉的幾種缺陷，是否盡能避免，在當局自然認識較淸，用不着我們來過慮。不過一經舉辦，我們極希望力求完善，能達到預期的目的。否則治絲愈棼，徒然加深當業者的困難，有　政府威信，而一般民衆，又未必能得到實惠，實覺得不償失。平價，限價，和配銷這一類辦法，過去失敗的經騐太多了。事實證明了單打官話，在經濟的措施上，並沒有多大效果。所以不談管制則已，要談管制，便存不得宣　　簡單的心理，更不可忽視經濟上的因素。</p>

<p>莘莊究竟屬松屬滬</p>
<p>敝處住在滬西莘莊，値此省市劃界未解決之前，關於本年度田賦問題，頗爲本鎭附近居民所關心，現將事實寫在下面：一月以前，松江縣政府遍貼佈吿：謂欲徵收田賦，借糧，並征收自治捐稅，經上海市二十六區十五六保聯合辦事處，呈報市府核示；現據保辦事處宣布：已接奉市府指令內開，已專電江蘇省政府，令松江縣政府撤回莘莊辦事處，並警察分駐所，及停止徵賦借糧征稅等由。而松江縣莘莊辦事處方面，近正催令各鄉地保繳解。竊思人民處此立塲，究應順從何方，而能不違法令？爲特懇借貴報「讀者意見」一角，予以披露，或費神轉呈省市當局務求明確解釋，免使人民徬徨歧途，莫知所適，實不勝感激之至。（張務農）</p>
<p>速頒房屋租賃條例</p>
<p>自戰時房屋租賃條例於戰事結束六個月後依法廢止後，因戰爭造成之惡性房荒，即因無一合理之緊急法令加以管理而益形嚴重矣！法院援引民法之租賃法規爲解決現行，房荒糾紛之繩準，所作判決，若以定期契約承租人所處環境及事實而言，頗覺不當也。　夫戰爭之結束，並非即因戰爭所引起之一切惡性後果）併消除之謂也。觀乎前戰時租賃條例之規定於戰後六個月後廢止一事，即可知當時立法諸公估計戰事終止後六個月後，房荒問題方可消除。豈料外患方除，內憂未絕，於今一年有零，形勢更形惡化。大都市人口　集，房荒嚴重，糾紛不斷，理應另訂適當房屋租賃管理條例，以備法院判斷之繩準。然當局不暇及此，致使多數出租人得藉口依法中止租賃，以遂其金條出頂之貪欲，深覺遺憾！</p>
<p>反觀其他因戰事造成之後果，如通貨膨脹，有高物價以資調劑，敎育低落，則漸求整頓，交通不便，即令飭改善，獨房荒嚴重。未見着力救濟，反廢止僅有針對此一問題之租賃條例，而以現行民法租賃法規代之，猶似將九年前所製長袍一襲，令一無論身長身寬均有極大改變之人穿着，旣不雅觀，又不適用，豈非笑話！</p>
<p>進而言之，法院接受出租人終止租賃關係訴訟後，若爲定期契約，即令限期遷讓，今滬上租屋大多訂有期限，若期到即訟，（其實多數早已逾期）訟後令遷。且不論人情事實是否合理，即就承租人被逐露宿街頭，積少成多，致交通爲之阻梗，對治安行政，恐兩感未便也。夫法律乃根據風俗人情，道德習慣，與夫環境事實，交錯縱合而成，豈可離開上述因素，獨立而行；其所判是非，自難合理矣！故現行民法租賃法規，不但未能制定房荒，恐將因此產生其他不必要之糾紛及後果。</p>

<h3>公民投票棄權者多　法國新憲複決通過　揭櫫民治民有民享三原則</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十四日電〕法國新憲法草案昨日經公民投票表決，最後票數點淸如下：（一）法國本土暨北非屬地阿爾熱利亞·摩洛哥及都尼西亞，贊成票計九·一四三·三一〇票，反對票計八·〇八四·〇六七票，贊成票比反對票多出一·〇五九·二四三票。（二）法國本土方面（柯西加省除外）贊成票九·〇〇二·四六七票，反對票七·七九〇·六七六票，棄權者七·七七六·八九三票。此在本年五月間初次憲草表決時，全國並各屬地贊成票爲九·一〇九·七七一票，反對票爲一〇·二七二·五八六票。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十四日電〕越南各地昨日舉行公民投票，表決法國新憲法。據初步報告，反對者較贊成者爲多。南圻方面選民百分之九十均表反對，計贊成票五五二票，反對票二·九三四票。河內方面亦然，選民總數五·二六五名，投票者僅二·七〇一名，其中贊成票五〇九票，反對票二·一九二票。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十三日電〕法國新憲法今日由人民投票複決。此項憲草謀根據美總統林肯所揭築之民治，民有，民享三原則建立政府，其意義確已訂入憲法。前總統戴高樂及其他反對派之爭，僅在細節，其最後公斷者則爲全國人民，此乃民卞政治之基本原則。按照新憲法草案大綱，政府各部組織如下：</p>
<p>（一）「行政」設總統與總理各一人；（二）「立法」設立議會，由國民議會與共和議會兩院合組；（三）「司法」設立最高法院與高等法院；（四）「諮詢議會」設置經濟委會及法蘭西聯邦議會，以備諮詢。</p>
<p>戴高染堅稱兩院中之一院，即國民議會，對於行政司法兩部所保持之權力過大。其言是否正確，姑置勿論，惟此項權限之分配，係由法國共產，社會，及人民共和運動三大黨所決定，此三大黨代表法國一千五百萬選民，足以保證其所訂憲法爲人民所接受。但以戴高樂之聲望，亦足與之作劇烈競爭，因此其結果不易預言。</p>
<p>新憲法序言中稱，人人皆有不可剝奪之權利，無分種族，宗敎或信仰，依憲法，人人皆有加入工會及罷工之權，工人不僅可參預其工作條件之決定，幷可參加實業之管理。一切財富及一切實業之經營，具有全國公共事業或獨佔事業性質者，實際必須成爲全體人民所共有。序言中保證法國不作征服戰，並允於其地各國同意時，限制其主權，以維持及保衛和平所必要者爲限。國民議會議員六百十七人，由直接選舉法選出。共和議會代表二百五十至三百二十名，一部份由國民議會推舉，一部份由選舉院推舉，僅國民議會有完全立法權。共和議會可起草法案，提交國民議會作最後決定。</p>
<p>戴高樂精神勝利</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十三日電〕法國新憲草，今日舉行公民複決，據此間各投票所報告，早上投票者人數寥寥，天氣雖晴朗，至午刻爲止，若干投票所人民前往投票者，僅及五月份複決憲草時投票人數之一半。但據各種强烈指示，全國選民中將有百分之二十放棄投票權。越南老撾省因地處邊隅，交通困難，乃將法國新憲草副本用降落傘投於四郊各區。據擁護戴高樂者稱，此次投票棄權者甚多，反對票亦必不少，此爲戴高樂將軍之精神的勝利。戴氏以新憲法未能建立一種可以遝用之政體，且有變成無政府及獨裁制度趨勢，曾勸國民加以否決。惟共產·社會·及人民共和運動三大黨均贊成此項憲草，戴高樂雖熱烈反對，各黨領袖則力勸國民加以接受。</p>

<h3>日本之政黨與議會（下）</h3>
<p>戰局進展順利時，圖從戰果中取巧分肥，彼等現仍在</p>
<p>政治幕後活躍</p>
<p>，以爲目前國際情形，對彼等有利，盼望美蘇關係惡化，誇張中國國共衝突，在貴族院中造成反華空氣。內相大村淸一在九月九日貴族院中，答覆山田良三關於韓人及合胞之取締問題時，居然稱中國人爲第三國人，而非同盟國人，後經此間代表團去信更正，始乃聲明爲誤會。大藏省主稅局局長池田勇人本月九日在貴族院中，答覆松谷順助關於財產稅徵收問題時，亦欲將台胞視作第三國人，而將</p>
<p>台胞不列華籍</p>
<p>。根據盟國當局規定，同盟國人在日本並無納稅義務，而主稅局畏池田居然在議會中聲明關於台胞之財產稅徵收一事，政府刻正在商討中。此一連串之事實皆說明保守勢力利用此輩政客作工具，</p>
<p>以圖死灰復燃</p>
<p>。爲欲强化陣營，大同團結乃必然之歸宿，故最近保守勢力結成統一戰綫之聲甚囂塵上。據各報所載：吉田最近曾親與進步黨總裁幣原商談兩黨合併問題，認爲現在祗應有急進與保守兩政黨存在，以促進</p>
<p>日民主之實現</p>
<p>，並曾對聯合社記者發表此種主張。同時，自由黨文計嘉六（前上海敵特務機關兒玉秀雄機關之重要份子）與進步黨河合厚相，曾就合併問題舉行密談。據悉：合併後之新黨領袖，將由吉田担任，幣原及齋籐隆夫則出任最高顧問。兩黨內部意見雖尚未完全一致，但合併僅係形式問題，實際上早已</p>
<p>組成聯合陣營</p>
<p>。十月中舉行之各地方選舉，自由進步兩黨且曾決定互相協力，以擴大保守派勢力。自由黨對進步黨之地方選舉候補者，並願予以實力上之援助。此點說明兩黨在實際上已</p>
<p>實行大同圑結</p>
<p>。社會黨及係去年十一月間，由安部磯雄·賀菱豐彥·高野岩等社會運動前輩集戰前工農會最高幹部所組成，爲議會中最大在野黨。最高的理想在經過議會而實行社會主義，主張在維持天皇制之範圍內實行社會民主主義。此種主張在社會黨向議會提出之</p>
<p>憲法改正草案</p>
<p>中，表現甚爲明顯。社會黨經此第二次全國代表大會後，議會中心主義之色彩益爲濃厚。該黨政策本以勞工會總同盟爲活動中心，領導羣衆遝動以擴張黨勢；惟因該黨在議會中爲最大在野黨，故此部份勢力不得不傾注於議會活動方面，且最近</p>
<p>勞運中心指導</p>
<p>勢力落於共產黨之手，社會黨多處於被動的地位，故對此次船員罷工，國營鐵道員工罷工，及新聞廣播事業罷工，均採旁觀態度。社會黨內構成份子亦甚複雜。議會總選舉時，社會黨當選議員中有廿餘名係各公司董事長，同時又有主張與共黨提携之人民戰綫派，及聲明與自由黨合作之反共份子。此次全國代表大會選舉結果，</p>
<p>右派勢力獲勝</p>
<p>，即以勞工工會總同盟爲活動地盤之西尾末廣當選爲書記長，而片山哲升任爲中央執行委員長。此次大會中，中立派森戶辰琦說明社會黨聲明拒絕共黨參加救國戰綫之原委時，引起左部分子之不滿，在塲內，左右兩派</p>
<p>發生一塲惡門</p>
<p>左派青森縣代表大澤久明質問右派謂如欲組成民主戰綫，必須與共黨合作。社會黨在此次大會中，對目前之勞動運動幾採取否定立塲。大會主席水谷長三郞答覆右派代表大塚英五郞之質問稱二現工會指導者是否了解工會精神，誠屬疑問，現係須加以反省之時，並謂：在議會提出吉田</p>
<p>內閣不信任案</p>
<p>亦甚簡單；但打倒吉田內閣並非簡單之事，此次大會中，共黨曾派代表野坂參三前往遊說，要求與社會黨合作，結成人民戰綫，惟未得結果。同時社會黨本部並令各地支部，停止與共黨合作，足見社會黨有逐漸變爲政府與黨之勢。吉田口中亦露出自由，進步，社會三黨合併之議，社會黨內亦有與吉田組織聯立內閣之意。此次</p>
<p>全國代表大會</p>
<p>中，各方對該黨幹部非難之聲不絕於耳，對民主戰綫未能實現，甚感不滿，懷疑該黨幹部是否尚有誠意實現該黨所標榜之社會主義。一部份子如加藤勘十郞，木茂三郞，荒烟寒村，高津正等，有分裂之說。同時與此政治攻勢相呼應之代表，保守經濟勢力之經濟團體，亦先後宜告成立，如關東經營者協會，經濟同友會，新產業人聯盟者，均已正式成立。雖井坂孝鄉，古潔，達山愛一郞，松本太郞，島田勝之助，因肅淸令關係自經濟界表面穩避，但仍有藕斷絲迎之關係。此種保守勢力之主流如何發展，頗有値得吾人注意與監視之必要。</p>

<h3>議員被檢舉漢奸說　高院表示未接控訴　筱快樂劇團播音不應辱罵陸克明　潘議長昨發表重要談話</h3>
<p>本市勝利遠東兩電台，連日有筱快樂劇團播音，辱罵參議員陸克明·潘議長昨特爲此向記者發表談話稱：參議會中確有建議政府對廣播節目應予審查之議案，但非陸參議員所提議，且與筱快樂無涉，何況參議員在會塲發言，依法對外不負責任，該劇團更不能隨便根據報載傳說，濫施攻計，如陸參議員認爲該劇團公然侮辱，妨害名譽，自可依法控訴。至於電台廣播，原有主管機關，其節目內容，核發執照者，確應負責注意審查，倘有違背法律之處，當可依法取締，播音劇團屬於游藝人員，亦必有其同業組織，市社會局即爲其主管機關，如有不合舉動，主管當局諒亦不致坐視也云。</p>
<p>又關於最近有人對少數市參議員提出漢奸嫌疑問題，潘公展以議長資格表示意見稱：對於漢奸嫌疑之檢舉，乃以行爲而非以職務爲標準，本屆市參議員之資格，均經公職候選人資格甄審委員會審查合格，如認爲不當，應由該會負責，與市參議會無涉，同時對於檢舉漢奸，行政與司法當局，應有統一之觀點與解釋，該問題僅涉及個人附逆問題，因此對該會如加攻擊，實屬不當。又高等法院首席檢察官負責表示：迄現時爲止，該院未曾接獲人民對於市參議員有漢奸嫌疑之控訴云。</p>

<h3>關於檢舉問題　候補議員意見不一　對少數人假用名義表示不滿　招待記者會中引起互相攻訐</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日來本市盛傳檢舉兩逆參議員一事，頗爲各界所注意。上海市候補參議員聯誼會爲聲明對此事之立塲及意見起見，特於昨日下午二時在新生活俱樂部招待新聞界。到該會常務理事魏裕農，楊志千，尹勇，謝大荒，王知本等五人，及候補參議員曹亞俠，吳仁勳，黃筱文及本市各報社記者三十餘人。由魏裕農任主席，說明該會於九月間成立，推定理事十五人，常務理事五人，理事會下設總務與研究兩組，總務組下設文書，會計，庶務三股，研究組下設調查，設計，編審三股，幷另設民政，財政，警務，經濟，交通，教育，福利，衛生，土地，法規等十種研究委員會。其中心工作爲謀候補參議員聯絡感情，對市政設施，共同研究，互換意見，提供當局注意改善，以冀達到爲民眾謀福利，故與當選之參議員本質上，是絕對合作的，決非對立的。</p>
<p>報告意見四點</p>
<p>繼由曹亞俠報告該會意見四點：（一）依據立法院頒佈之僞組織或其所屬機關國體任職人員候補選任用限制辦法第三條規定「曾任僞組織或其所屬機關團體担任職務，未依懲治漢奸條例判罪者，二年內不得爲公職候選人，」故希望當局自行檢肅，合法調整。（二）公教機關服務人員不得當選爲參議員，市立中小學校長亦不得爲參議員。（三）鄭重提出聲明本會會員絕不是要想遞補參議員而爲檢奸工作，參議員中有附逆事，自有法律制裁。本會僅在代表民意推動此項工作。</p>
<p>檢舉引起舌戰</p>
<p>關於檢舉附逆參議員一點，楊志千並解釋聯誼會中不但無此舉動，並無此動機。若有人偕用本會名義檢舉，我們是絕對反對的。</p>
<p>常務理事王知本對於用聯誼會名義檢舉附逆參議員事極爲不滿，起立聲稱：候補參議員有一百八十一人，決不能照一二人之意見代表全體。檢舉漢奸乃每一市民都能做的事。報載有鋤奸委員會之成立，並稱魏裕農爲負責人，對於此點，本人表示疑問。</p>
<p>魏裕農當即表示「負責人」此名義並非本人自我宣傳，而係報上所載，此事並無可出風頭者，有人「氣不過」即出此言。兩方意見引起衝突。王知本認爲根本無所謂「氣不過」，既非出風頭事，又何必以少數人名義出面自認代表眾意，本人亦爲常務理事，尚且對一切事情毫無所知。檢舉附逆漢奸，顯係少數人有包辦作用。又據王氏告記者稱:聯誼會會址本在威海衛路二百七十號，嗣後其他各理事突然將會址遷移，本人並未知情，實屬神秘云云。</p>
<p>後經楊志千聲明各常務理事意見實際上亦與王氏相同，目的在否認聯誼會有此舉動。希望各界勿予誤會。招待會至此即告結束，關於賽馬具有賭博行爲，應拒絕開放一點亦未及說明。</p>

<h3>市黨部新任主委暨委員　昨舉行宣誓典禮　中委吳敬恆監誓儀式隆重</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市各界擴大紀念週暨新任市黨部主任委員方治及委員兼書記長謝仁釗，秘書處長徐冠亞，組訓處長陳保泰，宣傳處長陶百川，委員吳開先，沈春暉，錢劍秋，謝大荒，周斐成，陳寶驊等，宣誓典禮，於昨晨在陝西路市體育館合併舉行。會塲佈置，頗爲莊嚴。中央電影攝影塲並派員蒞塲攝取新聞片。九時正，監誓人中委吳敬恒及市長吳國植，潘議長公展，暨各界來賓杜月笙，程滄波，徐寄　，奚玉書，李熙謀，胡西園等五百餘人相繼蒞會。九時半典禮開始，行禮如儀後，方主委領導宣誓。</p>
<p>吳敬恆致訓　·發揚民主·</p>
<p>宣誓畢由監誓人吳委員敬恒致詞，略謂：「目前上海已成爲東方政治的重心，對於西方政治重心的紐約一切批評，大家都很重視，今後的上海，也同樣值得重視，我們萬不可把上海再看成一個「十里洋塲」的都市了。談到政治，最時髦的名稱是「民主」我們國民黨就是爲民主奮鬥而成立的，我們對於民主一天沒有拋棄。現在有人要拿民主督促我們，以爲我們不熱心民主，這是大大的錯誤，因此我們希望在政治重心的上海，從黨部做起，能够把民主精神發揚出來。抗戰期間，方主任委員曾在政治重心的重慶，主持黨務，成績很好，此次來滬，駕輕就熟，一定有更好的建樹。各位委員，也都是黨的重要人士，定可以與方主任委員合力完成此項偉大的使命」</p>
<p>吳市長詞　希望三點</p>
<p>繼來賓致詞：首由吳市長致詞稱：今天參加方主任委員及各位委員的宣誓典禮，特別提出三點，對於我們每個黨員的希望：（一）要有捨生取義艱苦犧牲的精神，（二）要有見義勇爲爲人服務的熱忱，（三）要有寗人負我，我不負人的情抱。具備這三個條件，我想全國同胞，沒有一個不愛我們的黨。今後上海的黨務，在方主任委員及各位委員領導之下，一定可以把國民黨的精神發揚光大，完成我們黨的任務。</p>
<p>·潘議長語·　要有新作風</p>
<p>潘議長繼起致詞謂，「上海的黨，盼今後要有的新作風，不獨國民黨員，應爲三民主義奮鬥，而且要發動全市市民，亦願爲三民主義奮鬥。上海市黨部，應把全市市民都看作忠實的三民主義的同志，以建設三民主義的國家，三民主義的上海」，嗣王參政員曉籟致詞，渠盼望「黨政一體」、全國人民在黨的領導之下，實現三民主義，完成世界大同的理想。</p>
<p>方治答詞　貫澈革命</p>
<p>嗣由方主任委員代表宣誓人致答詞，略謂，「願提出幾點今後的願望：（一）遵守中央法令及中央決議，實事求是，埋頭苦幹，決不敷衍，因循·誇張·欺騙。（二）黨政一體，政和黨，彼此應保持密切聯繫，我們當配合民意機關，共同協助，吳市長推行政令，建設大上海，目前尤以抑平物價扶助工商，救濟失業爲最重要。（三）「爲政不在多言」之時代已過去，民主政治下之政黨，應儘量表示自己政策與決策，全市民眾亦應積極建設與批評，言不在多，而要說真話。（四）鞏固統一，保障和平，尤其是中央法定最近就要召開國民大會，關係長治久安百年大計的憲法，就要制定，希望各黨派社會賢達，團結一致，共謀國是。」最後宣讀黨員守則，高呼口號，十時半奏樂禮成。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕本市各機關爲表示歡迎新任市黨部方主任委員起見，特於今日下午三時，假麗都飯店，設筵歡宴，並備有餘興。</p>

<h3>懲治漢奸條例內「所屬團體」字義　商會電請明日解釋</h3>
<p>市商會爲懲治漢奸條例第十條之「所屬團體」字義，亟須早頒批令，明白解釋，俾正視聽，而安人心，昨特分別電呈行政院內政部，組織部，暨上海市政府籲請，茲探錄原電如下，「竊屬會於本年五月間，爲懲治漢奸條例第十五條之「所屬團體」字義，請求補充解釋，如非在僞組織特設之團體任職者，不以「所屬團體」論，不受於一定限期內不得爲公職候選人之限制以魚代電呈請組織部暨社會部核示嗣屬會本屆當選理事駱清華因公入都復進謁中樞當局詳細陳述，將魚電面遞並以淪陷期內各處有保甲之組織，十戶一甲，凡里巷稍具身家之人，均被指認爲甲長保長聯保長，在當時居民既無法脫離虎穴，競赴內地，亦惟有担任虛史名，名遭橫禍，因其組織普及，敵牽涉範圍更廣，如照懲治漢奸條例第十五條辦理，於一定年限內停止其公權，則十戶之中，必有一人波及，能爲地方辦理公共事務之人，幾於一網打盡，在若干時期以內無復可以驅策任使之人，關係實屬太巨，擬請解除文綱，與民更始，且曾在淪陷時期內任保甲職務，而無媚敵殃民之行爲，現在推行地方自治，仍舊當選者，應依照處理漢奸案件條例第二條第十款規定辦理，免受懲治漢奸條例第十五條之限制，呈請鑒核主持辦理在案。嗣於八月九日奉組織部敬指字第七〇五四號八月魚代電內開：前據呈請補充解釋懲治漢奸條例第十五條疑義一案，當經函請政部核辦，准復稱，該商會所請與行政院解釋願意，顯有差異，爲慎重起見，已錄案呈請行政院會同司法院統一解釋，能行全國，俾成定案，而釋羣疑等語。特電知照等因下會。迄今行政院會同司法院之統一解釋，尚未奉有明文而卅五年八月九日行政考試兩院公布之「僞組織或其所屬機關團體任職人員候選及任用限制辦法」訂明本辦法自公布日施行，其適用範圍，自應以「僞組織或其所屬機關」任職人員爲限。法文含義，至爲明白，不容混淆，本已無待解釋。但仍有人曲解法文，欲以「所屬」兩字，與「敵僞管轄範圍內」之人民團體，混爲一談，意在羅織，盼遂私圖。報章傳載，莫辨是非，殊足淆惑觀聽擾亂人心竊按處理漢奸案件條例第二條第十款：「敵僞管轄範圍內之文化，金融，實業，自由職業，自治，或社會團體人員，憑藉敵僞勢力，侵害他人，經告訴或告發者」之規定。查同業公會與商會，爲本款所指之金融或實業團體，而各級保甲組織，則爲本款所稱之自治團體，其任職人員，必須有本款後段之罪嫌，經告訴或告發者，始合厲行檢舉之規定。所謂「管轄範圍」內之團體，與同條例其他條款所稱之「所屬」機關或團體，其輕重截然不同。而行政院考試院八月九日公布之限制辦法亦已明白規定爲「所屬」團體，是在敵僞管轄範圍內之同業公會，及保甲人員，均應不受本辦法之限制。務請迅賜明白批令解釋，以正視聽，而安人心」云云。</p>
<h3>八年中敵人欠下的一筆血債　罪行調查登記統計　去年十一月到今年四月　總數已達三萬餘件</h3>
<p>〔本報特稿〕這是血債！是敵人在八年侵略期間所欠下，至今尚未清償，將來不知如何了結這血債？</p>
<p>請看一看上海地方法院檢察處自去年十一月到今年四月敵人罪行調查登記的統計：</p>
<p>卅四年十一月份　一二九七件</p>
<p>十二月份　一一九一九件</p>
<p>卅三年一月份　一〇一六〇件</p>
<p>二月份　六六〇九件</p>
<p>三月份　四二二件</p>
<p>四月份　二三一件</p>
<p>總計　三〇六三八件</p>
<p>這裏的敵人兩字，包括了敵憲，敵軍，和敵僑。而三萬零六百卅八件的罪行中，被害人能指出犯罪人的姓名和所屬部隊的，衹有四百八十八件，佔總數百分之一點六都不到。其罪行之分類爲：</p>
<p>謀害與屠殺　七一件</p>
<p>對平民施以酷刑　九八件</p>
<p>強姦　三件</p>
<p>拘留人民予以不人道之行爲　五八件</p>
<p>軍事佔領期間有　奪主權之行爲　二件</p>
<p>搶刦　一五件</p>
<p>沒收財產　一二〇件</p>
<p>勒索非法　過度之捐款與征發　二件</p>
<p>肆意破壞財產　一一九件</p>
<p>總計　四八八件</p>
<p>我們試閉眼想一想這三〇六三八的數字中，包有着，多少慘絕人寰的故事？而在這多少條人命，多少堆血淚中，亦有着多少寫不盡的激昂慷慨，可歌可泣的史料啊！難道做了大國民就把這一頁血賬輕輕的抹去了嗎？</p>
<p>當勝利後，司法行政部命令地檢處舉辦這敵人罪行調查登記時，那些扶老携幼從四鄉趕來的善良的同胞，慘痛的訴說着當年家園和親人怎樣受到敵人殘酷的燒殺時，一滴滴的熱淚從眼眶中不斷的流出。現屆清償的時候了，他們衹有一個願望，—懲治那些殺人的兇手。雖然有許多不識字的，善良的鄉人，大多不能道出行兇者的姓名和部隊，但他們聽到有處可申訴，特地不怕麻煩遠道趕來登記的那種精神，是萬分虔誠的。他們信—殺人者終將受到應得的報償。</p>
<p>說到這裏，我們該回顧一年來，審訊日戰犯的工作進展得怎樣了，至今全國一共懲治了幾個？拿他來和敵人罪行調查登記的數字比一比吧！佔了幾分之幾？</p>
<p>「三〇六三八」，這血淚斑斑的數字！然而我們得認清，這還衹是上海附近敵人罪行的一部份？那些默默犧牲無人知曉的，那些未曾去登記的，那全國千百萬倍於上海附近一角的敵人罪行—千百萬倍的「三〇六三八」，又將如何來洗雪呢？這問題，在敵人罪行下死難的同胞，正期待着我們生者給予答覆！</p>
<p>說不盡多少血淚斑斑的故事，這是血債！是敵人在八年侵略期間所欠下，至今尚未清償，將來不知如何了結的血債！</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市楊樹浦復興島倉庫，曾於上月中句，述續發生封存五金物資被竊，事後經有關方面派員偵査，迄無綫索。緣該島於勝利後，即由海軍駐守，戒備甚爲嚴密，宵小活動，事實上決不容易，顯係另有內情。因此常局乃從側面着手，直至上月廿八日始發現北京路德豐里八號協泰昌五金號，有出售是項五金材料，乃派員將該號店主紹興人陳振昌（卅三歲）予以拘捕，經偵訊後供稱：上項鉸鏈共計七箱（五百五十打），係由華龍路八四八號安徽人葛傑介紹，向席迺椿處北京路顧家弄七十三號）以二百二十五萬元代價購來。當局據供後，即按址前往將席葛兩名拘獲，據席供稱：在三四日前經葛傑及另一河南人張新民（住南市方浜路德安里三號）之介紹，認識復興島海軍警衛營第八連述長沙振華，謂有大批五金私貨，價廉物美，如欲購買，可由沙負責包送，余因一時惑於重利，當予允諾，翌日即由沙派武裝海軍兩名押運五金鉸鏈兩搨車，計大小廿一箱，至本人住處，索價八百萬元，惟經余常塲檢點，發覺箱內並非全屬鉸鏈，故當時僅接受鉸鏈八箱，計代價爲三百四十九萬元，後以二百廿五萬元凑足五百五十打售予協泰昌，結果非但未能獲利，反虧本百餘萬元之鉅。至此全案眞相太白，當局遂將該監守自盜主犯沙振華在復興島海軍警衛連部予以逮捕，一經鞫訊直認偸竊不諱，至於由席處退回之其餘五金材料計銅鎖八箱，拉練五箱，則寄存於中正中路大中里一七八號徐州人殷林生處，亦已由當局前往吊出，惟拉練已另裝麻袋二袋，此外，尙發覺該犯在本案發生前並曾盜賣十匹馬力之馬達及帮浦，由葛傑轉手以七十萬元代價出售於一名「阿七」者，評情尙在繼續偵查中。主犯沙振華因係海軍現役軍人，故已由當局解交海軍軍法處依法懲辦，其餘各犯則移送地檢處偵査起訴。</p>

<h3>美軍法庭　續審納粹戰犯　日軍情報部長出庭作證</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕德國投降以後投效日本繼續從事諜報工作之德駐華間諜機關歐哈德局重要人員二十七人，昨由美軍法庭繼續開審，出庭作證者係前駐華日軍情報部長日高孝少佐。彼舉出歐哈德局與日軍當局合作之一例稱：當冲繩島作戰時，日軍賴歐哈德局廣州支部之報吿，而覓得美海陸軍之方位及佈置。該項報吿由廣州支部首腦希嬰具名，並蓋有支部之暗號。　供述至此，被吿辯護人方面當庭提呈一文件，係證人簽字之對</p>
<p>首席辯護人勞佑中校所言，內述不能確定該項報吿係何人所寫，因當時彼在南京，而報吿則來自廣州，且係由華南日第二十三軍情報部所轉來。</p>
<p>因此辯護人認爲證人之言前後矛盾，不足爲憑，但檢察官杜威少校則指斥辯護人所提供之文件於簽字時未經美軍部人士在塲，故不能成立。</p>
<p>雙方激辯良久，始由證人繼續證述。據稱歐哈德局各部份人員之主要工作爲截取美海陸軍之無綫電通訊而譯出其密碼。冲繩島戰役之後，日軍在華北之活動亦有賴於歐哈德局之情報云。</p>

<h3>皮革業處境困難　無力負担新稅　生產萎縮營業不敷開支　工資利息太高競爭不易</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕値茲工商業不景氣，生產萎縮之秋，本市製革工業，亦以面臨絕境，萬難再行負担新稅聞。日昨下午七時，該業公會各理監事，假銀行俱樂部，招待新聞界，痛陳該業近况。據該會理事長張善璋稱：目前制革工業，已臨危機，萬難負担百分之十五之貨物稅。張氏旋列舉該業目前最嚴重之困難四點：（一）捐稅繁：（甲）營業稅：不分整賣另賣，一列課稅千分之十五。自原料商（生皮商），售與製造商，轉售與批發商，再售與零售商，或皮革製品商，每經一商，付稅一次，重疊課征。（乙）印花稅：本年四月修正公佈之印花說率，每千元貼花三元，無異加征營業稅千分之三，而重疊之課稅，復與營業稅問。（二）工資高昻：戰前工資與現在之比較，約增一萬倍，而熟皮之舊價，則較戰前僅高四千倍。現在工資佔成本總數百分之十三。（三）高利貸：政府生產貸款，以押品及各種手續等限制頗嚴，不易獲得，而市上利息高至二角左右，即以一角五分計算，底皮製造耗時三月，耗於利息者佔成本總數百分之二十四。面子皮，製造亦須一個半月，而利息的佔總成本百分之十七（四）洋貨傾銷：根據上述三種原因，國產皮革成太高昻，而洋貨則以一切機械設備完善，成本特康。復因外匯率祗及戰前一千倍，乃得大量來華傾銷。目前國產底皮，每市斤成本約計六千餘元。而市價頭號底皮，祗售三千餘元。南美洲來方底皮侮磅僅舊二千餘元。國產面子牛皮每方尺（一百平方英寸）成本的爲三千元以上。而　價僅二千元左右。澳洲產紋皮普通貨每方呎（一百四十四平方英寸）爲二千餘元。品質既優，尺碼几大。故國貨雖如此貶價，猶乏銷路。</p>
<p>職是之故，三四月來，各同業以賣得貨款，抵付工資及業務上之開支尚感不敷者，比比皆是。於是工作時斷時續，產量大减。上月調查：大中製革廠每月產量，由十萬磅減至二萬磅。大華廠由六萬磅减至一萬磅。中南廠由六萬磅减至六千磅。中國廠由六萬磅减至一萬四千磅。協源昌由一萬五千磅减至四千磅。手工皮坊力量脆薄，現在停頓狀態中者，已達十分之二。長此以往，則本業之總崩潰，可指日而待。乃又有貨物稅之開征、稅率百分之十五，高於營業稅達十倍之多，是誠加速其屆潰，數千工人，將告失業。而各廠廠主，亦將被迫改業。結果惟有一任生皮出口，候外人加工製造後，再以熟皮或製成品輪入·利權外溢，殊堪痛惜。</p>
<p>最後分由該會常務理事杜剛，監事襲應奎，分別致詢，略稱：政府開徵新稅，人民當有納稅之義務。惟前提仍應顧及本業是否付力負担。否則，因小失大，反失國家　植工業之初衷。故擬籲請暫緩開征貨物稅，待本業危機過去後，再行重訂稅率，從輕征收。聞該業將於日內推派代表晋京，向常局陳述困難情形，請求暫緩開征貨物稅。</p>
<h3>烚赤市況平穩　美鈔成交頗少</h3>
<p>烚赤昨形勢平穩，央行續加管制，晨開一三〇萬五，客銷尚股，買氣未泯，曾　升至二二二萬，始有壓力，穩後轉盤，十時後央行以二二〇萬七五之價，配給一五〇條，入後漸漸由平轉疲，退入二二〇萬大關，央行隨市稍加調節，多方不支了結，迨午降至二一八萬，午刻在二一九萬元光景盤旋，午後在二二〇萬關口掙扎，甚爲平穩，結果較上週六回小一萬二，飾金紋銀均平，銀元北銷又滯，回落甚多，暗拆平平，息價在一角半至一角八不等？</p>
<p>外滙形勢已漸緩和，美滙依然沈寂、英滙一四七〇〇元至一四九〇〇元，印滙一一三〇元左右，港滙九二〇元左右，略有成交，美鈔門市仍以三五〇〇元爲買價，難獲成交，喑盤約四二〇〇元至四四〇〇元，並無多大成交，結果與上週六相彷彿，港滙因港申電及期鈔均已回升，自九三〇元退至九二〇元有售，結果較上週六回小千元。</p>
<h3>債市清淡</h3>
<p>公債成交不過三百餘萬，求供雙方仍無整數，散多續賣，七縷某大戶稍有納胃。形勢尚穩，統而晨開二一〇〇元，高價不過二一五〇元至二一八〇元之問，有些微掙扎，中途復回落至二〇五〇元以下，始稍平穩，結果較前收微升三〇元，甲乙亦好二〇元，丁戊尚平。</p>
<h3>寗紅新貨佈樣</h3>
<p>寗州紅茶，今年新貨，已由忠信昌茶棧首批運到，的五百餘箱，刻下雖佈樣應市，惜在賣戶喊價奇昻下，尚未開盤，其他花色，品質較佳之陳茶，出口行俱仍垂愛，且尤以高檔紅茶，英莊注視更緊，惟過程均因貨稀供缺，交易並不熱烈，至于本年新特貢，新珍眉，聞白頭行頗有躍躍欲試之態度，目前正擬向貨方展開談判，而紅綠茶內銷，祁門花香，土莊製茶廠咸抱來者不拒，陳婺炒，本街店莊略有問訊，餘則成議甚少。</p>
<h3>各方觀望不前　華股交易不振</h3>
<p>華股苦悶更甚，各熱股櫃檯前亦頗爲沉寂，塲外對敲旣已逐步抬頭塲內交易一落千丈，晨初開出曾告小漲，交易十分淸稀，不久即由穩告疲，中途起仆殊微，節節下游，檯面帮遂乘勢放空，中途曲折毫無，僅由北帮略納，難敵賣氣，近午時浮空抵補，一度見回，無如買氣至暫，在塲外供源，迄未中斷之壓迫下，臨收時再告屈服，結果與上週六相較計新亞水泥各跌一成，勤興小十分之八，內衣五和中絲麗安統益信未中紡新光景福各跌半成左右，永紗美亞大通火柴華豐挫落百分之二三，公司榮豐景綸則微挫，總成交額共約七〇〇萬股，塲外各股在買主缺乏中，續告疲落。</p>

<p>中央信託局前自日本運抵人造絲四千餘箱，決公平分配全市各絲廠應用，茲悉首次配貨本週內即可實行，昨日起正由該業公會辦理各廠請購人造絲登記、限三日內完成，並由公會員責告誡登記廠商，務須依照實際需要量塡寫，不得謊報，如一旦查出，與實際用量不符，不但將取消配絲權利，且追償歷次配貨，聞中信局人造絲配給，將較中紡公司所配者爲低，前中紡配價爲一二〇號天橋，每箱二百八十萬元，中信局將爲二百五六十萬左右云。</p>
<h3>天橋又升五萬</h3>
<p>人造絲市價尚未能見平，昨一二〇號天橋有光始終做四百二十五萬元，中間减過三十萬元，結果水上週末又提升五萬元，各號雜牌有光及半光等均各漲五萬元至十萬元不等，廠經市况平靜，交易淸淡，現貨亦異常缺乏，昨D字等級有成交價做三百七十一萬元中，不過是陳絲，且條份色澤均非上乘，普通五担老單子價做三百五十五萬元，亦屬次貨，干經未見做開，綢貨昨市寂寞，去胃呆滯，故各貨價均未見增减。</p>
<h3>絲織業　擬組公庫　目的在便於抵押</h3>
<p>上海市絲織業同業公會負責人稱，該業於過去數月中，幾瀕於危，其主要原因，厥爲原料之困難，與高利貸之重壓，目下原料方面，因日本人造絲已運到四千八百箱，今後尚有六千箱繼續運來，由中信局依據各會員商廠實際需要數量，每月分八次配售，故原料問題略可解決，至於高利貸之壓迫，現正由該會向　業銀行方面，商討組織　業公庫，　使各會員廠商，得將原料及製成品，辦理抵押，以　活資金之運用，現正擬具辦法中，一俟組織成功，則該業前途，可轉光明。</p>

<h3>塲外對敲復活　證交當前的嚴重問題</h3>
<p>證交市面，未見暢旺，經紀人皆感煩悶，市塲　資，顯未能導入投資市塲，實爲始料所未及。</p>
<p>我們知道黑市交易的興旺，有賴於對講電話者實多。證交對正當經紀人與營業員曾允許裝懂對講綫五其，經紀人與經紀人之間，絕對不許有對講電話存在，但這張支票，並沒有兌現。</p>
<p>上市股票又實在太少了。仿照美化的上市費及年費，使國產廠家望而却步。第一批上市的二十種股票中，五熱門輪不到塲內，投資者對其餘的十幾種冷門，實在無十分興趣，反之，好的股票，被摒於塲外的太多，亦使投資而做股票的，裏足不前。</p>
<p>塲外對敲交易漸漸地復活了，如何領導游資，從賭博式的對敲大戶手中，移轉到投資市場去活動呢？塲外交易的蔓延，究如何設法防止呢？這實在是當前的嚴重問題。（舊人）</p>
<h3>麵粉管制了　小麥未管制　廠商稱原料不敷</h3>
<p>麵粉市塲自外滙調整後，即日趨混亂，當局雖管制粉價，但對小麥價格，迄未予以管制，致麵粉黑市猖獗，近當局對管制粉價，已下決心，並飭令五大粉廠，增加拋售量，昨據本市茂新麵粉廠負責人談，五大粉廠之拋售麵粉充其量，頂多每日一萬包，此並非生產量不足，實因小麥來源不暢，故粉廠方面亟望小麥之價格，予以管制，並疏通其來源，俾增麵粉生產。</p>
<h3>平價粉配售法</h3>
<p>按現在五廠聯合平價麵粉配售處，自上月二十五日開始配售麵粉以來，迄上星期六止，業已配出十二萬　左右，每袋重量四四斤，配價一三，九〇〇元，配售對象，均係麵粉商號，該處除星期或例假停配外，其餘每美配售數額，定九千袋，申請辦法，依照第一次核定之粉號，共計七十家，按過去銷敷，酌予核定，每天派配，據第四區麵粉工業同業公會負責人稱，本市麵粉工廠，現開工者約十七八家，照現有設備，每天可製十萬袋。</p>
<h3>米價堅定雜糧轉疲</h3>
<p>米市河積仍豐，客貨登記一萬五千餘石，店方挾巧拾取，市形早堅午疲，結果粳米略淡，秈米無榮無辱，內地價榕挺立，暫成　旋之狀，惟白元貨稀，零化活潑，續升一二千元，黃豆各路來貨湧旺，仍然不脫疲境，勢難向榮，蠶豆胃呆，步跌千元，菉豆津浦南段來源亦多，依然乏神而少交，中下略小千元，紅糧站定，芝蔴漢口來貨甚湧，再居下游，步跌一二千元，生仁供過於求，市而平疲，新赤豆　小三四千元，惟麩皮仍然牢硬，豆餅無軒輊，油市各油均見　小三五百元。</p>
<h3>配價未動　存紗遵令申報　漲風並未稍戢　棉布呆滯約小二三千元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日紗市晨初，因公會佈告諄諄告誡業中人，遵照市長論，據實中報存貨，人心一度趨軟，據悉市長面論，棉紗業同業公會，飭令限期辦理棉紗登記，其日期極爲短促，自即日起，至明（十六）日止，即行截止，凡棉紗業同業公會會員現存棉紗數量，均須於明日下午五時前辦妥登記手續，由該同業公會　報，以憑核辦，然以客銷活躍，買戶踵至，織廠帮採辦甚勁，加以常錫走化獨健，開盤後逐步上升，廿支紗均好四五萬，三十二支細紗尤爲缺缺俏，與四十二支雙股綫同漲十三五萬之多，脚地甚堅，並未因紗登記事而稍衰焉。</p>
<p>紗　聯合配銷會，昨日下午循例開紗，計民營各廠配售六五一件，紡建公司配售六一七，五件。配價以廿支紗爲標準，每件仍爲一百五十五萬元。總計第二期集團配紗共三萬件，此中民營各廠佔一萬八千件，現尚配存一，八七九件。紡建公司佔一萬二千件，現尚配存一·四五一件。紡建公司昨日所開各支棉紗，十支立馬筒紗配內衣帆布業。廿支豐年配染繼及毛巾業。卅二支立馬配針織，手帕，駱駝絨業，四十二支藍鳳配染廠。六十支彩球配內衣業。</p>
<p>布市頗沉悶，無起色，價亦疲落，良以客帮採辦岑寂，本街之走化復呆，實因時令雖屆深秋，而氣候仍和暖，是以概銷不暢，因此逐轉形冷淡，昨市龍頭細布做八萬六千元，藍V八萬四千元，二十支無牌細布七萬四千元，四君子嗶嘰九萬三千元，藍鷄七萬八千五百元，其中除嗶嘰外，約小二三千元不等，故昨日市價，較週六紡建開價，亦跌五百元至一千元云。</p>

<h3>台灣糖　到六千餘噸　十八期已配出　約二萬四千包</h3>

<h3>白煤價已出百萬關　來源阻滯市上存底日薄</h3>
<p>煤市白煤節塊陽泉及焦作因無來貨，市上存底日薄，貨主扳價甚緊，喊價高至一百零五萬元，一百萬至一百零二萬元，略有少數成交，新鴻基因現有配售，爲數雖少，然因此次配貨中尚摻雜開抱·馬克等白煤，故市價反較陽泉爲低，成交價較前市微升一二萬元。</p>
<h3>進口業的痛苦　約計之共有六端</h3>
<p>勝利以來，獲利最多之營業，盡人皆知爲進口業，但據進口業商談，其困難亦甚多，（一）爲英美各國對進出貨物管制甚嚴，出口貨物須經該國核准，甚至於貨物裝輪之際，忽吊銷出口證書，（二）爲出口廠商父貨時間無定，（三）爲根據外匯管理暫行辦法，請求外匯之後，必須於三月內結匯，到期不能結算，由中央銀行照該日市價收買，如是則交易尚未成功，須先損失匯率及手續費。（四）爲一般商家爲成本及减少麻煩起見，多採辦同樣貨色，以致某種貨物或至供過於求，（五）沿途損壞，碼頭盜竊情事，（六）爲高利貸，在訂貨時，申請外匯，普通須交百分之三十至五十之保證金，而交貨日期却毫無把握，照每月一角六七分複利計算，僅需五個月貨物未到，利息便與本金相等，如時間再長，則所得利潤更微云。</p>

<h3>蘇島血痕　印尼第二次暴動內幕</h3>
<p>— 九月廿日蘇門答臘峇眼亞比航訊　茂明</p>
<p>自本年三月十二日因國旗被辱，僑長被殺，房屋被焚，致與印尼發生衝突之事件和解後，峇眼亞比華僑總會當局認淸際此非常時期，欲求地方之繁榮與安全，非促進華巫兩民族間之和睦團結不可，故盡量運用國民外交，冀能避禍於此靑黃不接之期而保全埠中僑衆之生命財產。故舉凡政府之措施，盡力予以協助，對印尼之紀念日，則予以慶賀或參加慶祝，對望加麗北千峇汝長官之蒞臨，均盛宴招待之。最近再應政府之倡議，組織國際俱樂部，中巫印三民族，均行參加，該會方於九月三日宣告成立。</p>
<p>事變發生與發展</p>
<p>繼一般印度尼西亞極端派，尤其是武人，對三月十二日事件之和釣，（乃由北千分州長調解而簽訂）頗認爲不滿，而亞沙漢。班哖一帶印度尼西亞極端派，素以華僑爲俎上肉，更不滿峇眼政府當局對華僑之軟弱（？）。且該地帶，隊伍紛雜，爭權奪利，非另覓新地盤，似不足以飽其私慾，故約於兩個月前，所謂班哞之海軍部隊（長髮）未經照會本地政府，擅自越界侵佔本地屬轄之利巴咸埠向當地華僑强徵軍糧，且將華僑拘禁毆打，無所不至，當時華總即向當地政府交涉，並電北千請求着令該外屬軍隊離境，雖蒙尤爲照辦，但並無效果，及數星期前該部隊復推進到離本埠僅二小時水程之龜務埠，僑商物資悉被搬取一空，曾有一艘馬來亞貨船在附近海面被扣，二位瓊籍華僑被殺害，該部隊進而在海面截刦，不論商船以及檜枰之物資，多有被搶奪者，華總據情向當地政府交涉取締，政府雖答應仍無效果，最後本地郡長及警長曾再三向本會保證，謂該部隊若一再抗令，政府將採必要處置之，並稱若非經本政府事先許可，該部隊最擅自在本埠登陸，則政府不惜以武力解決之。因有政府之保證，故僑衆恐懼之心理减輕，而全埠居民，仍得安居樂業。</p>
<p>嗣後武吉丁宜國民軍上校，北千峇汝警察長，望加麗分州長憲兵隊長，及數十名武裝部隊聯袂來埠。據云其使命即爲解決利巴咸及龜務之問題，僑衆對政府之注意處理該無紀律之部隊，私心頗覺欣慰，該批長官抵埠後，亦曾召見僑領談話，促華巫應合作親善，各僑領無不應諾。九月十八日晨，該批長官官向吾僑借用電船，謂將親往龜務埠解決抗令之班哖海軍，但僅帶少數部隊同行，該船開行約一小時後，即見其會同另一電船拖帶數艘舢舨駛返本埠而來，船中滿係軍隊，僑衆頗覺驚異，及見該軍隊在碼頭登陸，人數的二百名，武器守備，多數爲班哖海草，於是華僑沿途逃避。商店關門閉戶，秩序大亂，此時華總人員尚出而勸導各僑胞應鎭靜勿誤會，該軍隊一出海關即分一部會同各長官前往政府機關，另一部份即鳴槍爲號，並率向市中心區衝擊，爲首者提機關槍，逢人射擊，一潮州人躱避不及，應聲倒地，僑衆以事臨最後關頭，備有武器者，即舉槍還擊，一時槍聲卜卜，展開激烈巷戰印尼機關槍手及前鋒數人，被擊命中，不敵遂退守海關倉庫，僑衆即困守海關口，另一方面，兵營之印尼兵一聞槍聲，立即包園華人住宅區，並佔華僑樹膠廠（該廠爲四層樓）爲堡壘。控制數條街道。僑衆以腹背受敵，形勢危殆，決意先消滅海關倉庫之班哖匪軍，經數度之衝鋒，卒於下午一時將該批匪軍擊退，入夜雙方均嚴密戒備，未有接觸，惟僑胞以住宅區之大批婦孺均受敵人控制，消息不通，憂心如焚，澈夜不能入眠。十九日淸晨，槍聲復起，但雙方均採守勢，一小部份僑眷冒險於黎明時逃出火綫，避入市區，報告印尼軍之橫行，謂有數名婦孺巳被擊斃，而大部已被拘禁，所有住宅物資已被洗刦一空，此消息益增僑胞之煩心。</p>
<h3>背水搏鬥三小時　印尼逃亡敗退高豎白旗</h3>
<p>總會恐事態不可收拾，特擇於一印尼人以轉達總會之意旨，請警署及各長官應設法調解此次爭端，並開始和平談判，二小時後得政府覆函，贊同和平談判。惟請總會全體委員須持白旗到郡長公署談判，政府祖保各委員來回之安全，總會則懇請政府派代表到市區內談判，總會將保護政府代表之平安，然政府置之不覆，而印尼兵進攻益急，彼等依靠優勢之武器，控制大部十字路口逢人射擊，致市區交通，多處已被切斷，情形之惡劣，無可言喩，僑衆感覺殺身之禍已迫在眉前。</p>
<p>語云：困獸猶鬥，何况人類？背水爲陣，茍非戰勝將無顦類，於是較有阻略者羣起鼓勵反攻，衆多響應，最初目標，爲奪回樹膠廠。遂分數路前進，不顧槍林彈雨勇往直前，經二小時之激職，印尼不支敗退。於是膠廠即被克復，乘勢收復巾華公學及民德書報社（均在住宅區）此時在該地區受困之僑眷，紛紛脫險入市區，此時民氣極盛，乘勢圍攻兵營，旋即攻陷之，繼而攻佔郵電局（內有伏兵）最後圍攻繁署（警署武器最多，旣不能維持治安，亦應保持中立，但警署却以大量武器供給印尼兵，復向住宅及居民不斷射擊）此時動員之民衆，數達一二千人，鑼笛之聲不絕於耳，衝鋒陷陣聲勢赫赫，卒將警署團團圍住，警察胆寒，紛紛逃亡，最後警長乃持白旗投降。此塲反攻，頓同僑之同心協力，勢如破竹，歷時僅三小時，卒將市區內之印尼反動勢力，予以肅淸，而被拘禁之吾僑婦孺五六百人，至是乃得慶生還，而印尼之殘餘勢力，則竄入郊外之森林中矣。</p>
<p>據報告：印尼兵在危急時，原擬將集中營吾僑俘蘿殺害，適管理集中營之印尼人帶鎖匙出走，後雖經印尼兵用刀將鎖砍開，而吾僑已追踪而至，誠可調險矣，又據報被拘禁之婦孺中，有遭受印尼兵之毆擊及姦淫者。</p>
<p>觀此次事變，印尼兵行動之神速，顯爲有計劃之陰謀。政府口口聲聲，提倡親善合作，今竟假借解解決龜務之叛軍，而集中各地之軍力以謀我，兵不抵禦敵國，而用以擾民，安得不引起公憤。</p>
<p>至印尼兵此次尋釁之目的：一爲報復三月十二日蠻幹之失敗。二則因印尼之經濟力薄弱，將以暴力鎮壓市區而後向吾僑任意勒索。</p>
<p>印尼兵曾受相當訓練，且軍械充足，集合各地精銳並警察及暴徒人數千名，且有預先之計劃，乃竟在二日短期內敗於素無訓練及武器缺乏且無準備之僑衆。此乃吾僑爲自衛生存而鬥爭，理直氣壯。而印尼採用暴力侵犯他人，實傷天理，故一經接觸即告崩潰，然吾僑之傷亡亦達百餘名矣。</p>

<h3>提防印尼再反攻　華僑積極佈置呼籲援救</h3>
<p>當十八日上午事變後，印尼即拍電各地請派援軍，當晚吾僑亦曾派代表向伍總領事及馬來亞之同胞請設法援助，及至十九日晚本埠大局已定，惟恐外地印尼援軍源源開到，萬一抵檔不住，則二萬餘僑衆將被屠殺一光，故二十日晚再派代表四名到馬來亞呼籲救助，並載受傷者七名（槍彈未出）往馬醫治。</p>
<p>廿一日全市積極佈防，以汽車運輸樹膠片堆積於各路口作爲沙包之代替品，以利防守。下午派武裝隊伍護送約百名之印尼婦孺返回郊外。據探傍晚有運儎印尼援軍之電船二艘，在離本埠約七公里之亞羅港停泊，該處與本埠水陸兩路均可通達。</p>
<p>廿二日淸晨，探悉印尼援軍的百餘名，已在亞羅港登陸，因恐外來援軍繼續集中後，將會合本地敗兵包圍市區，故決先發制人攻其無備，即派隊水陸並進。上午的十一時由馬來亞返回電船二艘，報告伍總領事已向英荷當局交涉，請求支援，並曾訪英特派員基倫勳爵請其到吧城調解印荷爭端時，順向印尼總理沙厘氏提出抗議；電船並運到接濟品若干，僑衆心理爲之稍安。下午進攻部隊平安返回。據云敵軍深藏森林，毫無蹤跡，無法作戰，而停泊該港之二艘電船，乃馬來亞華僑所有，係在北干被印尼當局扣押運兵前來。該軍曾帶機關槍二挺，步槍數十枝，吾進攻部隊當即將該二艘被押電船放回木埠。據該電船人員稱：儎有華僑代表及七位受傷者之金海利電船，在潛水港海面，被印尼扣押往望加麗埠，人員生死未明，僑衆頗爲焦急。</p>
<p>廿三日上午九時半，聯軍飛機二架繞市空飛翅偵察地面情形，約十分鐘。僑胞精神爲之奮發，有如獲得救兵。據由馬來亞返回之僑胞報告，此乃領事向總督交涉之効果。下午據傳龜務華僑三百名，已被扣禁；而八名被殺，惟切實情形未悉。保衛團下午開會，討論加强武裝組織及選任正副指揮，並將隊伍分別爲海陸防衛隊。</p>
<p>因敵船不斷運儎援兵並扣押船隻，故廿四日晨武裝海龍號即開往海面巡邏，上午飛機再來偵察。路邊小販本日多已復業。據潛水港華僑訊：該處印尼兵已退走，華僑平安。</p>
<p>廿五日上午飛機再來偵察，碼頭僑胞打旗語請援，路上禁羣衆觀望，秩序頗佳。下午據海面檜枰捕魚者報告稱：曾有一亞沙漢電船之華人船員向渠宣稱：亞沙漢曾封押十四艘電船，準備運儎援軍來此促峇眼華僑注意。而據一位由村落逃難者稱：在文冬牙村中之卅餘名華僑已被慘殺。於是人心惶惶，不可終日。晚倫敦及重慶廣播電台均報告峇眼之事件謂，吾政府將派代表前來調查眞相。又本晨運儎三名重傷者往馬來亞之電船，又在海面被印尼扣押，後經海龍輪之追擊，始將電船放四，然五名華僑已被拘捕而去。</p>
<p>廿六日上午飛機照常來偵察。華僑以白布寫英文字置於碼頭上，內書「受包圍請速救援」字樣。晚重慶廣播謂：「據吧城電，峇眼華巫衝突已逐漸和緩，蔣總領事曾表示，一個中巫聯合調查團已於廿五日起程。據一位由蘇島前往吧城之印尼要員稱：此次事變乃由自稱爲印尼海軍而實是荷蘭間諜之煽動者到達峇眼後所發生」。「歡迎調查團蒞臨」此决印尼極端派之暴動，吾僑奮勇抵抗，乃純爲自衛，蓋若非將該批匪軍擊敗，則將被大屠殺，彼等所希望者，爲安居樂業，故望該調查國能從速完成其使命。</p>
<h3>鄭州掠影</h3>
<p>— 二日鄭州航訊　本報特約記者王瘦梅</p>
<p>車到鄭州，天已經快黑了。在站上隨着旅館兜生意的茶房，一道去旅館，看了幾家，都是破破爛爛的，髒得要命，就沒有讓人滿意的房間。可是價錢並不低，三千元一天，連上茶水同加一的捐稅，一個旅客每天要花四五千元。吃飯更不用提，吃頓飯。就得兩三千元，鄭州的生活程度，確實比開封要高一倍。</p>
<p>鄭州給隴海平漢兩路十字形的穿過，形成了中原交通樞紐約重鎭，每天在它底懷抱裏投入來自不同地方的旅客，而每天也吐出很多旅客，讓他們走上自己的目的地去。鄭州一天天在從荒凉中復甦，在一天天走向繁榮。</p>
<p>橫遭摧殘迄未透氣</p>
<p>鄭州是橫遭過敵人摧殘與破環的城市，到今天它還沒喘過氣來，表面上的熱鬧，總掩飾不下內裏的凄凉。這裏沒有一條像樣而淸潔的街道，來往不斷的汽車吉普車，大卡車，飛揚着大量的塵土，讓人喘氣都不舒服。</p>
<p>大同路，德化街，是這裏最先走向繁榮的地方，商店的貨物都是從漢口或上海運來的。不多。一到晚上，街上充滿着行人，店鋪裏刺人眼睛的汽油燈，可並沒有把他們吸引了去。原來，匯聚在這裏的人羣，有很多是因爲戰事，交通斷絕，被阻在這裏的。</p>
<p>這裏是五花雜處，秩序非常紊亂的城市，搶案在最近就一連發生了兩起，可是，很快的就給負警備責任的劉家康團長破獲了。綏署顧兼主任正飭令劉團長整頓軍風紀，在嚴厲的執行下，成效已相當顯著。在今天，各個城市裏的駐軍，都以態度同風紀差池，給予人民很壞的影響。</p>
<p>一動一靜異於開封</p>
<p>鄭州同開封是相距一百四十里的兩個城市，但是兩個城市里的氣氛，可完全不同。一個太靜，一個太動。把開封比作北平的話，鄭州可有點像唐山。在太靜與太動的城市裏，同時都帶給人以難堪的窒息。鄭州沒有一家能稱爲報紙的觀得上眼的報紙，而讓當天的開封報同漢口報紙，把讀者爭了去，誰不說這是一個笑話呢？這裏書店裏同開對一樣，充滿着軟性而荒淫的讀物，精神食糧是很缺乏的。倘若你不是太庸俗的人，你會深深感到寂寞的。舊戲院子裏，唱河南墜子，說大鼓書的去處，人擠得滿滿的。像樣的電影院沒有，而且都是演着敵僞時代的影片。徐聲領導的劇宜一隊，綏署政治部的演劇隊，雖也不斷演出，但是並不能把這裏的沈寂打開，自然他們的努力精神是很値得人欽佩的。爲了加强活動，爭取新的進步，由劇宣隊副隊長陳鐘主持，成立了中華戲劇協會鄭州分會，推行舊劇的改進工作，希望這羣拓荒者本着戲劇工作者傳統精神不懈地努力下去。</p>
<p>防疫救災成績可觀</p>
<p>鄭州這城市擁有三四千的妓女，在這些妓女集聚的逍「里」那「里」，有着大量的客人，那雜亂的情形是可想見的。日前發生的詐財案，就是發生在一家妓院裏的。針對着這些現象，劉團長會同着專員縣長進行淸查戶口，保甲組訓，自衛隊訓練，各階層的普訓工作，加强了警備工作，有計劃地使這沒秩序的城市走入正軌。連西北隅的老墳崗，那攤販·流氓·地痞·散兵遊勇麕集的去處，也改作成國民市塲，修劃出街道，使「人必歸戶，戶必歸甲，」以减少盜匪。竊賊的潛伏與活動。</p>
<p>鄭州是一個骯臟的城市，現在正流行着時疫。當局組織的衛生委員會，正推行着防疫，淸除垃圾，整理陰溝，建立公共厠所的工作，還舖了和濟分署的工作隊射噴DDT，在路口强迫注射防疫針，來减輕疾病對這城市居民的威脅。</p>
<p>這裏正推行着救災運動，成績比開封好。他們拿出工作成績來，不像開封似的以「靜街」來討好。「靜街」這名詞，在別的地方從北伐以後早已忘記了！</p>
<p>上次我從上海回來，曾匆匆地路過這城市，而這次得有機會住上兩天，飽看了這城市後，心裏覺得很快樂。鄭州是「亂」，是「餠」，但是它到處都在改進，都充滿着生氣。這正是它値得我們快樂的地方。</p>
<p>台省楓港台東間隧道（特派員江暮雲寄）</p>
<h3>台南紀程</h3>
<p>— 九日台南航訊　本報特派員江暮雲</p>
<p>記者於九月中旬離省都台北，作本島中南部行，爲時半月，於本月初漏夜北返。原定計劃尚擬作澎湖，台東行，可是旣存的交通已感困難，而九月二十五日的颱風更把海上和山巓的航路阻斷了，衛生局派往澎湖縣急救霍亂的醫師和看護十餘人，蹲在高雄旅社裏兩週以上，僅有百噸以內的台交丸，也不能定期行駛；而從屏東到合東的公路，在平時已使旅人認爲畏途，即使能抵達台東，到花蓮港以後的臨海公路，自上次經地震後，在花蓮縣部份，迄今尚未修復，這兩地顯然和省內隔絕了，使記者環島行的計劃，直接受了影響，迫使遄返台北。獲有好成績</p>
<p>田賦征實　獲有好成績</p>
<p>不到台灣中南部，不知台灣之大，更不知台灣的富饒。在歷史上，中南部是文化之區，也是政治中心，它所擁有的背景是一脈平原，收獲着每年兩期的穀。有適宜的天時和人爲的水利，保障農產的豐收，三百萬以上的農民生息於斯，終老於斯。過往日本人的公私有士地佔百分之六十，台灣拓植株式會社就是最具剝削能力的大地主。農民們取得統治者肥料種籽的配給，需價付二分之一的收成，同時廉價搜購食糧，以血汗獻給統治者。光復以後，這租佃制度顯然已有了大的改革，若千日產土地已轉讓農民耕種；若干官有土地，則以低廉的租價交付了耕者，反映在這次破天荒的田賦徵實，全部獲有十分之八九的成績，就足以說明農民對應納稅的義務底深度。但官方以征實的米穀和貸金，將取怎樣運用的方式，是農民們所最關心的，因爲這是來年的股鑒，也是政治施策的絕好試騐。可是官方不盡沒有可以商榷之處，荒瘠的山林，和不能生息的「敷地」（地產），其徵收額依二十六年漲起的八十倍以上，使納稅人不再能負担，以事前未予考慮，終使人民提出「抗議」。（本省人提抗議，是口頭禪）蔚成新風氣</p>
<p>反對現實　蔚成新風氣</p>
<p>記者在兩週內走進南部各大城市，也曾接觸着各階層的地方士紳，靑年和農工，以及代表民意的縣市參議員。他們都有滿腹牢騷要求發洩，更有無數問題亟待解答，他們常以去年今日的熱情奔放，滿腔希望針對着現實來較量，一般的部以咒詛現實憤恨規實爲談話和討論的主題，說得露骨一點，他們在失望之餘，以反對政府造成了一種新的風氣。</p>
<p>這種新風氣演變的結果是人民與政府，軍隊與民衆，民衆與民衆之間的齟齬和隔膜，短見的省人，就歸咎於外省人。在南部，他們和外省來的是「阿山吓』，這是一句諷語，而在高雄港，兩者之距離更疏且遠。若干小事常引起軒然大波，若干不成問題的問題，結果成了大問題。我們不能說省人的小題大做，因爲他們離開祖國的年代太久，他們的脾氣是偏狹的，急躁的帶有熱帶工業地區的性質。可是就這樣，常給地方官史和諷眞工作者以莫大的灰心。</p>
<p>人們說，輿情爲什麼挑撥政府與人民間感情？而人民却責怪着爲什麼政府不能面對現實，採納民意，而與人民保持很遠的距離？</p>
<h3>包辦民意的紳士</h3>
<p>在台灣代表民意的參議員，大都是醫學工作者，過去日本人容許本省人獲得醫學博士的學位，而限制一般受中，高等教育的機會。他們在光復之後，便被民眾選舉爲地方縣市參議員，而且部份的還兼任鄉鎮長。記者在新營參加了台南縣府召開的七十六鄉鎭長會議，他們之中，大多數就是縣參議員，而且部份的是醫生，敎育程度都在中學以上。對於鄉鎮長，他們還保留着以前的觀念，自己尊重也被人尊重。這情形在高雄縣也是一樣，五十六位參議員內有二九人兼任鄉鎭長。政府在決定本月十六日後實行鄉·鎭·區長民選之前，發佈了兩條命令，其一是現參議員不得兼任鄉鎭長，其二是日本皇民奉公會人員不得出任公職。前者目前大都已辭去鄉鎭長職位，專任參議員，後者却使參議員感到惶恐不安，事實上在日本人時代顯露頭角的若干也正是現在相當紅的人，尤其是每一地方的參議員，像嘉議市二十一位參議員，據告祗有兩位不屬於以前的皇民會，這兩位都是女性。省胞憤慨地說，御用紳士包辦了民意，可是除了這批紳士，還可以挑選多少參議員，這是問題。政府也正爲了這，不得不採取寬容的態度，訂定檢舉的辦法，這是政府的苦衷</p>
<p>工廠停閉　失業成問題</p>
<p>省胞不滿現實的是物價高漲，貪官汚吏橫行。對於物價，他們爰以去年今日作比，其實要海島不承受外來的波濤，是困難的。對於貪官汚吏，政府鼓勵人民提供具體事實，依法嚴辦，但他們就並不能這樣做，只是在咆哮，在牢騷。我曾問過好幾位負有某一單位的主管，他們都是本省人，他很坦誠地說，偏狹而意見不統一的本省同胞，實在不易容對付，光復時他們以爲取得日本人地位的，理該是本省人，事實上却並不盡然，台省並不能與國內脫幅而一切統歸自我，結果他們失望了。目前他們唯一引爲嚴重的是失業問題，這却是事實。記者在南部參觀了三個糖廠，其中之一是屛東台灣製糖會社分廠，具有白糖三千噸的生產能力，現在正停着工，台糖公司準備在年內使若干工廠恢復，但蔗田的面積顯已縮小到五分之二，尤以台中一帶米蔗兩可地帶，人們更抱着萬分疑慮，不願施種甘蔗，縱或公司一再宣傳肥料有辦法，並予蔗苗每甲（十五畝）三千至六千，耕作三千至四千元的貸金，但仍觀望不前。先前不得零售的甘蔗，現在到處成了市塲，工人們則望蔗田而唏噓。隨着蔗糖而停工的有紙。和酒精等工廠，嘉義市的丁醇廠，全盛時期有三千多職工，全部財產在二千萬合格以上，生產着汽油·阿莫尼亞·葡萄酒·殺蟲劑等，目前却需要三千萬台幣的修理費，始可復工，現在工人有二百餘，資方因爲原料飛漲，不能即爲修理開工，尚須裁撤二分之一，留百人担任警衛，記者參觀時，這批職工，正在竊竊私議，爲失業問題而恐慌。其他的農產加工工廠，甚至豐田都是一樣，原料和人工的高漲，迫使廠方不能再爲生產，不生產則已，一生產就告虧蝕，這是危機。</p>
<h3>北國秋色無邊</h3>
<p>— 九月廿八日北平航訊　毓新</p>
<p>平津一帶「間歇式」的秋雨，數日不晴，事後一經調查，北平可用道句話槪括：「墻倒屋塌，七拉垮叉，屋頂茂草，脚下泥窪」。尤其宣外會館區一帶破舊失修的屋宇，雨後多半屋頂「洞開」，或是東倒西歪，未被雨勢砸塌的，屋脊以下滋蔓一堆靑草，微風過處，新生小草，面對簷前行客，頻頻點首，似在自鳴得意。此外畸曲小巷，經過迎日小雨，眼見泥悼處處、難得下脚，路上行人，大有「行不得也哥哥」之苦。</p>
<p>近日咫尺的天津碼頭，也鬧着塌屋案，接二連三不止。</p>
<p>淸查團人們，經千呼萬喚的督促，始翩翩出現。兩地久已接收的倉庫食糧—這些霉爛不堪的物質，已成了勝利後的淤血。老天放晴了！一紙「停職令」的頒佈，却無異加諸留用人員的天外霹靂！</p>
<p>一些衝要街口，却給北平加上一層彩繪，披上一束新裝，試過前門西單一游，便知：「烙」·「烤」·「涮」·市招已高掛於酒家門臉，用來號召老婆。眞的，秋蟲上市了，宣柿束子店一帶是個蛐蛐「集」，愛好蛐蛐的買主蜂擁而至，挑那振冀高鳴，强而有力者，稱做上品，出價五千，買者揮金似土，售者仍有吝色。次等的蟋蟀，（蛐蛐也叫蟋蟀）也値百元二百元不等。</p>
<p>蛐蛐的發掘出土之多，佔到秋蟲世界的首位。這動物喜在不乾不濕的士裏潛伏，據聞北平宣外陶然亭一帶不乏從事捕捉者，其中兒童尤多，一組二三人携帶一付傢具：鐵罩籬，土罐，小布囊，空心紙捲。孩子們天眞可笑，也有乾脆就伏在墳丘掏取，他們愛捉二意兒（蛐蛐頭上有二個觸鬚），三意兒，老米嘴。一會兒由紙捲引到罐裏幽閉，罐內如果相鬥高叫，必引起皆大歡喜。這些孩子們頭上的秋雲，嬝嬝飛舞，陶然亭墻外在洋一般的葦塘，一望無際，妝點得秋色無邊！同時，向兩側一看：農作物都已成熟，大花生是四葉相連，茄子頭上綻開紫花，充作淸秋少女的一項襟飾，那是多麽雅緻美麗！附近傾斜不齊的農家小舍，伴着這些遠近田畝，不愧爲一個田園都市了。</p>

<h3>美國婚姻之錯誤的</h3>
<p>— 端木萍</p>
<p>五分之一的美國婚姻都以離婚結束，而二十至三十歲的女人又佔了三分之一。爲什麼呢？美國的婚姻基於一種可笑的觀念—幻想的愛，又着重性感。那些男孩子把理想的妻子常作年輕的母親或操作的伴侶呢，還是以爲性感至上？後者生下的孩子又如何處糧？</p>
<p>他也許說孩子該受女人管，他自己以盡父職爲瘋狂，對孩子又認爲羞恥，這種性愛和浪漫的愛擋去了父愛的光輝。</p>
<p>婚姻的根本錯誤限明顯，在美國沒有人敎授「父職」。但是它却是男性存在的基本。這種本能要由經騐，閱歷，同時由孩提時非有一個眞正的父親接觸而來的。可是當孩子生下後那些美國的父親就大都消失了，白天他在公事房，晚上不是出外就是宴客，要不然就是太累了。孩子們對他因此很生疏，父親的熱情，瞭解，榜樣和本能的關切都不存在</p>
<p>爲代行父職或母職，我們的社會發明了許多引孩子人勝的東西—無綫電，故事書，電影，幼稚園或夏令營，那些校務又當諸婦人之手，因此美國的男孩生命之百分之九十是由婦人領導訓育，爲父者輕視了一已的責任。</p>
<p>有多少男子花了精力，時間，金錢去專心父職呢？有多少人的注意過學校的情形，有多少人精明地解決那些幼年的罪行？那是天賦給男性在家的職務，失去了它就能令妻子愁慮而致許多趨向離婚。</p>
<p>但男子對這種婚姻只該員一半責，女孩子更傾向幻想的愛。追求書中或電影上的英雄那種愛，所以當她一有這種感覺就忙着結婚，以爲一定有圓滿結果，這種情形下那些英雄又大都沒有錢·這種愛忽略了幾點：第一。錢財不能有助於男子的性格，反之他却常是嬌養了的。第二，婚姻不是一切的具結，更不能保證圓滿，結婚實在只是個起端。</p>
<p>火都的美國新娘都以爲結婚是無盡的求愛，把結婚當作訂婚的後果，只要物質舒適，孩子的可能性緩談，這就是她們所調的愛。婚後求愛的方式取消了，家庭不可作爲將來的投機，它是兩性相伴的處所，結婚不免是爲了性的基本解決。</p>
<p>不忠實是離婚的最大原因，而基於姦行的婚禮早晚要離婚的，因爲他們對那相伴終身之目的佔錯。</p>
<p>還有一點，許多美國男女孩子都抱着「唯一」的信條，要是女孩子們只交一個男孩，決不可能就遇到個性相合的。這種「唯一」的信條也可說是婚姻的障礙，因爲一個人若先夢想了對象然後結婚，那末他就會以夢想應用到生活上，在這種情形下，許多人都以爲是婚姻錯誤而忍受着，實在是他們的思想錯了，甚致有的因失望而喋喋不休或從慾；但是大半是離婚後仍去追求他們的「唯一」。</p>
<p>總之，男性若無做父親的根本意念就尙未長成，女性若欲保持新娘常態或是當了母親而不盡妻職就是未成熟，，妻子是一個眞實父親的夥伴。</p>
<p>家是國家社會的基礎，所以我們必須成立正式的家。人若對孩子引爲厭物而竭力避開他們，這樣長大的人就會引婚姻爲厭物。生命並不只是追求歡樂，我們如果要快活就得尋求快活而非歡樂，一個快活的人常是寬以待人嚴以責己的。</p>
<p>我們如果打算把婚姻起始做好，一定得改變那些人對婚的的觀念和佔價。年靑的男人不應想：誰是最漂亮的一個；年輕的女子也不可想：誰能永久把我常新娘般待。</p>
<p>正當的人生問題是；她是我爲孩子們選的最好母親嗎？他是最好的父親嗎？或者這樣設想：我願做她或他的孩子嗎？（譯自讀者文摘）</p>

<h3>女子的出路</h3>
<p>— 李營</p>
<p>每個女孩子到了相當年齡，學校裏功課也管修到某一階段的時候，自然的，對自己前途考慮起來，出嫁呢？還是求職？出嫁當然不是旦夕的事，尤其在現代，更須一長時期的考擇，於是就職了，一方面爲結婚的過渡，另方面私人經濟，也能自立·</p>
<p>她們在學校裏，受到新文化的灌溉，和年靑人固有的驕傲性，以爲自己了不起，滿嘴的男女平等，爲社會服務，做一個時代女性；然而，一離校門，曾幾何時，改變了初衷·固然，幾千年來的封建流毒，還遺留在現社會裏，可是，大半的女孩子，初出茅廬，抵不住外來物質的引誘，一念之差，遽爾失足，而羨慕虛榮過份，墮落的也不少。</p>
<p>很多職業婦女，她們的意志堅强，繼續苦守自己的崗位，一天天，一年年，眼見着年輕的小妹妹，一個個出嫁了，而她照舊忙忙碌碌，終日奔波，突然，有一股悲哀襲了她，不是悲哀單身的苦悶，也不是職務的煩惱，而是老年的難堪，到一旦再不能做事的時候，一個孤另另的老婆婆，如何生活？常然，須要一個歸宿，而歸宿就兌嫁人，於其到了「出嫁」之年，還不如趁年靑，結果，她們嫁了！</p>
<p>我反對「女子回到廚房去」「出嫁是女子最好的職業」，因爲前者是窮兵凟武壓迫女子的手段，後者正好是腦滿腸肥者凌辱婦女的藉口。不過，女子却一定要懂得料理家務，這是她們的天責。在美國和日本，都有「新娘學校」，這就可見得婦女對於家庭的重要，出嫁並不是一件倚靠男子的低卑的職務，相反的，是一樁最　聖的工作，做賢妻，帮助丈夫求事業的發展，做良母，敎養兒女，請人類的進化。而且，女子都獨身自立，世界不也絕種而毁滅了嗎？</p>
<p>有少數的女孩子，她們家庭環境好，資質又聰　，更有向上進取心，不妨中學大學，甚至鍍金深造，將來謀眞正的自立，爲社會服務，不過，須要絕對放棄自私的享受。假使半途而廢，嫁了人，生了孩子，家庭的瑣事，兒女的糾纏，包你沒有一刻休暇，除非你是沒有人性的。</p>
<p>最後，借用美前總統羅斯福的夫人的意見，結束我的拙筆：「要視環境情形而定，不可論斷，亦無固定的途徑可尋」。</p>

<h3>蟹粉球</h3>
<p>— 一鶴</p>
<p>時令又屆秋季，「無陽公子」又爲一般人所愛好·這裏，我介紹一種吃蟹的方法，主婦們不妨試試看，’、</p>
<p>〔材料〕蟹四隻——最好是雌的；蛋三隻，馬鈴薯一斤，鹽·薑·葱少許，味精及動物油。</p>
<p>〔製法〕先拿蟹煮熟，將其中的黃與肉分別地拆出，弄碎，再將馬鈴薯煮熟，去皮，搗　加入　，味精，薑　，蔥等，加以拌勻，使不過　。又將　蛋黃及白分開調和，以蛋白加人蟹肉內，蛋黃加入蟹黃肉。後各拌人爲鈴薯中使成兩堆。取黃色的馬鈴薯糊及白色的馬鈴薯糊各一半，做成一個個半白半黃的球，最好上面再加　　粒蝦仁。將此球放入油鍋中煎後，取出稍冷，便可吃了，其味鮮美無比。惟冷食即走味，以起鍋即上餐桌爲宜。</p>
<h3>义麻將　是中國民主娛樂嗎？</h3>
<p>— 方齊</p>
<p>上海一般家庭婦女，最愛好的消遣莫過於叉麻將。</p>
<p>我曾暗地調査幾十個家庭的主婦的日常生活，結果是大多喜歡叉麻將，只是喜歡的程度不同罷了。這結果頗使我驚奇，爲什麽她們喜歡叉麻將？原來最大的原因是生活過得去，不必爲開門七件事憂愁，也不必出去爲生活而奔走，一天到晚空閑着。錢由丈夫去賺，不必自己担心。家裏的一切又都有人料理：燒飯洗衣有娘姨，孩子有奶媽，差不多都是閑得沒事做，她們旣不願空坐，又沒有一種正當的嗜好，於是就想起叉麻將來消遣啦！而几义麻將並不限於未受敎育的主婦，很像是一種流行病似的普遍。</p>
<p>义麻將也像有癮的，叉慣了每天非义可。於是；</p>
<p>第一，浪費生命與金錢，麻將總有輸贏，金錢總受損失。而八圈十六圈的，甚至深更半夜的叉下去，弄到白天睡覺，晚上叉麻將，這實在是十分耗損精力的。</p>
<p>第二，夫婦間可能因了叉麻將的關係而時常發生爭吵或打架，以致情感上發生裂痕。</p>
<p>第二，有時因了一張牌的關係，朋友也可能爭論起來，有時雖不爭論，而各人心中已不快活了。</p>
<p>以上還是小事，最大的害處莫如對於孩子的影響；</p>
<p>（一）養成孩子的變態心理，大多數愛叉麻將的主婦，她們一天的開心不開心，多以這一天贏錢或輸錢爲準。於是喜怒無常，假使輸錢的話，時常會因小事或無事而打駡孩子。因此養成孩子一種見了母親怕，不敢言動的變態心理，使他不能儘　發展自己而妨害了他的將來。</p>
<p>（二）孩子是時時需要父母留意的，只要一刻不留意，他就會什麽都做出來，而且一次做了以後就時常會做。若母親喜歡义麻將，她就很少會管到她的孩子了，因此孩予往往會養成了許多惡習，而家裏還不知道。</p>
<p>（三）孩子最會模仿，父母有賭錢的習慣，孩子因爲耳濡目染的關係，很小很小就會叉麻將了。</p>
<p>（四）父母因要使牌局安寗，不惜以金錢供給孩子使他離開自去買吃的玩的，而結果養成了孩子揮霍的習慣。</p>
<p>所以，我希望一般家庭婦女即使不爲自已，也該爲了孩子一國家下一代主人的緣故，而痛改前非，不再沉迷於麻將。</p>
<h3>小兒的哭聲</h3>
<p>— 德華</p>
<p>育小兒，最爲麻煩，因爲他的發音器還沒完全。所以他一有不舒服不如意，不能由言語說出來，大多由筋肉和面部的表情表示出他不樂意之外，往往放聲大哭，但一般做母親的不易知道他哭的理由，與是很難處置，現在由兒童心理學者用其實騐和經騐所得，研究出小兒哭聲和他不舒服的關係，大體分爲兩個階段幸做母親多加注意：</p>
<p>（一）生後六個月的小兒哭聲：</p>
<p>一，用力高聲大哭——表示不自在，須要代替他按摩。</p>
<p>二，哭聲哀哀而不出淚——這是飢餓的表示。</p>
<p>三，腿部緊縮用力間歇的哭——這大槪是肚痛。</p>
<p>四，哭時欠伸——表示疲倦欲睡。</p>
<p>五，高聲用力的哭頭向左右動——表示頭痛或耳痛。</p>
<p>（二）一週歲小兒的哭聲：</p>
<p>一，臉上現紅流淚的哭——表示頭面上疼痛。</p>
<p>二，眼睛張開含淚，哭聲不大——這是表示抱法不好。</p>
<p>三，眼睛半開今淚，並咿咿的哭—這是躺得不舒服，或被褥不平。</p>
<p>四，眼睛半開流淚很少，哭聲帶長調—這是表示飢餓或是口喝。</p>
<p>五，突然皺眉混身戰抖高聲大哭——表示受驚。</p>
<p>六，兩腿縮緊並高聲大哭——表示肚痛。</p>
<p>七，眼睛張開無淚頭左右轉間斷的哭——表示不耐煩。</p>

<h3>論日記</h3>
<p>— 習喜</p>
<p>日記是最直接可靠的文獻了，但也有時爲下意識所驅使不知寫出什麽話來，若是一味相信親筆寫的東西，也不免誤入歧途的。不但日記，什麼自叙迴憶一類的東西都免不了這種毛病。近代名人李越縵翁文恭二公的日記都曾經以手迹付印，看他們治學治事之精密有條理，及記載內容之　富，不能不有觀止之歎。但是在這兩部日記裏就可以發見一件極可驚訝的漏洞</p>
<p>越縵日記的最後幾册在樊增祥手裏始終沒有交出來，所以影印的到五十一册爲止。自己丑至他死的一年—甲午冬天—總還有些文章議論。他死於甲午冬見於平步靑所作的傳。問之老輩亦記得是如此，而翁文恭日記則於乙未年某日忽然記着一條說拜李蒓客，此人名士也云云。此時李氏應已不在人間，如果說是筆誤，則口吻的確指的見李氏，如果說年月有錯誤，則日肥是按日寫下去的，如何會錯，而且李是翁的庚辰門生，名重一時，李之下世翁也不應略不提起，這是疑莫能明的一重公案。可惜李之日記後幾册不能公表來勘對一下。</p>
<p>李越縵的學問文章到晚年更純熟得全無火氣，他有些詩詞不但不存稿，也不寫在日記上。曾經看見一卷小畫是陶方琦畫的烟雨樓泛舟圖這是癸未年四月陶氏與樊增祥同訪許景澄於嘉興一段記游的手蹟。决年樊氏到京，越縵題了一段在後面：</p>
<p>「十年六夕宿鴛湖，淸景平生未易摹，五度帆檣依夜火，再來棋閣人平蕪。中興漸復千家集，久客空懷一櫂孤，難得故人携粉本。輭紅塵裏見冰壺。</p>
<p>錦袍靑翰似飛仙，二妙同乘下者船，雉堞山光分綠野，鷗波樹影接遙天；題襟並證西湖月，飛鳥高衝上郡烟。安得會稽能借令，栽花同老五雲邊雲門老弟以烟雨棋泛舟圖屬題，余自己未至辛未六過此湖，惟乙丑以哺，餘俱以夜，未嘗一登，己未在暮春，烟樹微明，樓閣如畫；乙丑以後惟敗甎零甓在荒莽中而已。今展茲卷，依然綺泓，鏡櫂蘋花，中流容與，羈懷塵目，彌增歸興而雲門將出宰定陽，余亦有津沽之行，話別臨歧，率成二律。何時提問挈鷺，重證舊游邪？甲申芳春節越縵老人。」</p>
<p>陶氏是湖南學使丁憂，許氏也於出使之後奉諱居家，樊氏則是年正回京起復，所以得與越縵見面。此時正有越南問題，而詩中只作吟風弄月之語，殊不能反映時代意義。陶氏不久病卒，越縵最爲悼惜，許氏以庚子之役被害，却是他所不及見的。詩旣不載集中，也不見於日記，但仍不失爲好詩。</p>
<p>因論日記想起這段軼聞。</p>
<h3>文學界的拿破崙　巴爾札克</h3>
<p>— 馬超英</p>
<p>巴爾札克（Honore　de　Balzac）是法國的小說家，他是浪漫主義和寫實主義之間的過渡作家。他的寫作方法；是寫實的，科學的。當他和一個人物，一個地方，一件事情，一個景象接觸時，他的眼睛，他的耳朵，他的一切感官都立刻活動起來，去觀察，去分析。同時他又有很豐當的想像力，可以使他所要寫的每一個人物和景象都生動地顯現在他的眼前。只要可以作爲他的小說取材的對象，不管是怎樣庸俗，醜陋，他都敢大膽地去採用。所以，他是十九世紀的一個大膽的冒險作家。</p>
<p>七九九年五月二十日，巴爾札克生於法國的圖爾城（Tours）。他的父親是一個學法律的人，巴爾札克在家庭中是他父親的長子，他有一個弟弟和兩個妹妹。</p>
<p>巴爾札克幼年時，在凡登城（Vendone）的一所敎會學校裏讀書、他在校課上是一個很平庸的學生，但是在　十三歲時，他使開始對於文學名著感到了興趣，便整天沉溺在閱讀中間，他讀書沒有節制，因此就影響了他的健康。於是在家裏修　了好多時。</p>
<p>一八一三年，巴爾札克的家搬到巴黎，於是他也到巴黎來完成他父親替他指定的法學敎育。出了學校之後，他繼續在一位律師的手下實習了一年半，接着又在一個登記官手下做了一年半的助手。但是巴爾札克不久便對他的職業表示反對，他立志要做一個文人。當時爲了這個意見，他的家庭　　起了很大的亂子，但是這些困難終於讓巴爾札克的堅持戰勝了，他的家庭允許他試騐兩年。</p>
<p>在這時，巴爾札克的家已經離開巴黎，獨有他仍住在巴黎的一所破舊的房子裏，他的家庭中每年只給他很少的用度，少得幾乎不够維持他的生活。但是他並不因此而氣餒，反之，他却以一種樂觀的，幽默的態度來對付他的貧困，在他那斗室裏，很努力地寫成了一部關於克朗姆威爾（Cromwell)的悲劇，可是沒有成功，但是他仍舊對於自己不失望，他相信只須自己不斷地努力，總有一次會成功的。</p>
<p>在一八二五年的時候，巴爾札克爲了賺錢起見，和幾個朋友組織了一個書店和一個印刷所，但是這些企業不久都失敗了。從這個時候起，巴爾札克便墜入了窘境，他只好寫文章來賺錢。</p>
<p>巴爾札克寫作工作的持久性是可驚的，他平常總是在晚上六點前後睡覺，到午夜十二點或一點起來，一寫便是十七八小時，有時甚至例外地幹上二十五小時也不休息。爲了支持這長時間的興奮起見，他總是喝大量的濃咖啡；這習慣成了他的致命大原因</p>
<p>從一八二九年起，巴爾札克開始在當時的法國文壇上佔了重要的地位。一八三五年的時候，他的名望已很大了。在一八四〇年以後的時期，這是他名望最盛的時候。</p>
<p>一八五〇年三月十四日的那大，巴爾札克度完了他的一生，便死在巴黎了。當時他娶了他遺求了十五年的　斯夫人（　Madame　Hanska）還不過幾個月呢！</p>
<p>巴爾札克的作品，在他自己手訂的全集，就有九十多卷，他給它一個總題叫「人類的喜劇」La　ＣomedieHumaine，這其中包括了六組「生活寫眞」Soenesde　la　vie和兩組「研究」Etude.他所寫的範圍，非常廣泛，描寫得亦細膩有致。由他的作品，我們可看到「王政復古」及「七月專制」時的全部法國社會，在那個時代的營利者·高利貸·投機業者·大銀行的代理人·外交官·大臣·商人·農民·僧侶·官吏·罪犯·警察等等，都活動如生的表現着。他這樣對於當時法國現社會的忠實的描寫，實在是當時浪漫派的異流。巴爾札克在世時，常自稱爲「文學界的拿破崙」，誠然，他的著作雄心，實不下於拿破崙赴敵的勇敢。</p>
<h3>種子</h3>
<p>— 張白懷</p>
<p>有一次我在夢中的荒原上發現一粒種子，我不知道這是什麽種子，但是這荒原的乾涸·貧瘠，我似乎忽然澈悟到一個久經思索的問題了。</p>
<p>這是我自己的問題。</p>
<p>我底希望的種子，確是落在涸瘠的荒原上的。說來我是個沒有受過好敎養的少年，我雖不愚笨，也從不浪費時間，並且我做的小小的工作，也很得到人們的讚美；然而，倘說我是一顆種子吧，那末，我正在想，此刻是春天，儘管萌芽，挺出在泥土之上，欣欣向榮地接受雨露和陽光的濯注，但隔不了幾天，要向地層吸收的水份，感覺不够了，伸出來的葉子，便也發黃了，道麽下去，春天還在天空翱翔，我的枝葉便已經枯萎。我是幾乎相信這譬喩會成爲讖語的。</p>
<p>爲了掙扎，我於是不得不時常注意我底種子的健全。一粒健全的種子，成長起來是一株茁壯的樹，茁壯的樹，才可以在貧瘠乾涸的泥土之上，經得住風暴，而在最後結出它美麗的菓子·</p>
<p>健全，那無疑是未來幸福的基礎了。</p>
<p>我怎樣才可以健全？</p>
<p>我是矛盾的，行爲和思想常常是不一致的；我是脆弱的，感情和理智常常是不平衡的；我是夢幻的，現實和理想常常是使我苦痛的；我，就是這樣的我，那當然還祇是抽象的我，但也可見我是在怎樣的不健全，在怎樣的虛浮的基礎上了。</p>
<p>我首先去追問健全的意義。</p>
<p>「健全的意義就是人性的完整」，這是一個人的回答：「人的精神，通德，和思想的的表現完整。」</p>
<p>「那可以說健全的人是太少的了。」我說。</p>
<p>「這世界的人們大多沒有品性，差不多所有的人，都是沒有品性的，惡的，不道德的。這不是我獨創的話，一個悲劇地戰鬥了一生的俄羅斯偉大藝術家就這麽說。這還不够，人們還對他們自己肯定，快洽，好似完全的人一樣呢！道才是最可憎獻的！」</p>
<p>我仍然不能瞭解健全的人的形象。</p>
<p>「它的最好的說明是人的外表，它的最好的象徵就是人的智慧。」這是另一個人在解釋着：「健全的人有健全的微笑，那不同於你所見的邪惡淫逸的笑：健全的人有健全的痛哭，他不會號啕悲痛而失去復仇的力量。健全的人，我們遠看，莊嚴而偉大，親近他，溫順而慈祥。觸怒他的，就是你違背自己良心的時候，取悅他的，你是完成你的某個希望了。健全的人，不偏私，不作無謂的憂慮和遲疑；他也做夢的，然而永不沉醉在夢中，他也會痛苦的，但痛苦不能壓倒他。健全的人，他的智慧像光，光的閃動可以明亮黑暗；像花朶，花朶在茂密的生命園林中，散放濃郁的香氣，使所有的人們都能够親近他的芳澤。」</p>
<p>我想，要成爲一個健全的人是難的。</p>
<p>「那末，」我間，「什麽是健全的基礎呢？」</p>
<p>「健全的基礎是由自己奠定的，」這是回答：利用一切機會，不要對你自己放鬆一步。」</p>
<p>「那是眞的太難做到了。」</p>
<p>「那不難做到，」這是他說：「好和壞是變成的。紀德說道：「如果人並非一向如此，怎樣可以說人永遠如此呢？人是變成的！相信他。」</p>
<p>我沒有再問，我也記起了他所說的「新的糧食。」我在無限欣快中找到了那本書。</p>
<p>「不止世界會變，」A·紀德說：「人也如此。將要從那處出現呢？那個新人？不會從外邊，同志，想法在你身上發現他，而且，像從金鑛裏提煉出無渣的純金屬，從你身上抽他出來，那個久盼的人，從你身上得出他。大胆去變成你所將是的。別輕易放過你自己，每一種生物是都有種種可佩的可能性。相信你自己的力量—自己的靑春，知道不斷的對自己說：「全在我！」</p>
<p>全在我健全呵！一顆荒原上的種子，已經在貧瘠的泥上上生長了，相信我也能够經得住風暴，開花結實，給人們嚐到很美麗的很甜的幸福的果子。（破殘的手記之一）</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　　63</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>因爲汽車靠不住，只好再候火車，却以一小時爲限，如再不開車，我們打算再僱汽車，走多少算多少，然後歩行，反正只有四十幾里地。過了不到半小時，忽然聽得食堂外，驟然嘈雜起來，隔窗一看，却是已經賣票，人也多了。後來才知道，站上雖然懸牌，不過廣告性質，必等人多，才賣票開車。而且車子要是走不過去，碰見衝突，也許停上一半天，也許打回票</p>
<p>上車時候，在軍上，我們很留心找那婦人，却不見她踪影。我們也料到在車上必有其他這一類的人，這一類的事，我已預先關照虎弟，無須逃避。東北自從淪陷之後，這一類的小偵探眼錢，沿路極多，這是日人的家常便飯；所以每個行人，必得遭到許多麻煩，有時軟來，有時硬幹，必得把你的來踪去跡，做什麽，什麽人，打聽得一淸二楚，才肯放心。</p>
<p>果然不到一會，我們對坐的一個中年男子，的莫既十多歲，商人打扮，突然打個呵欠，一伸腿，踢了虎弟一脚。虎弟一瞪眼就要發作。祗見那傢伙趕緊身身下去，替虎弟撫摸了幾下，一　連聲的陪着小心。藉此就同虎弟　話；問這問那。虎弟知道這又是鄉下婦人那一套，也不用矯裝，就拿他那自然的孩子頑皮勁，連賭氣帶侮駡，狠排喧了他一頓。那　伙受了這一頓，雖然勉強笑着，可也眞的氣得有些耳赤面紅。看那樣子，似乎還想軫機報復。</p>
<p>這時我陡然起了一陣不安的感覺，心下也有些懊悔。甚麽緣故呢？因我冷眼觀察一下，這一節車裏，僅我同虎弟的行動，有些呌人覺得岔眼。第一，只看那車上的茶伕，上茶上水的當兒，對每個人都那麽親熱，好像都是熟人，對我們就是一副死眉呆眼。第二，車上不管男女老小，都彼此有搭沒一搭撩着，談些家常，我們却不同人說話；這表示我們是另一路的人，顯得孤立。還有，這平通綫，不過一條短支路，常來常往的，我想大約也就是這些人，面孔都看熟了；我們，在那些人眼光中，大概有些生眼。要呌我們，在這條路上，當着日人或漢奸的走狗特工，當然對於像我們這一路的人，也要特別注意了。我懊悔什麽呢？原來未動身前，總隊長木來勸過我們改裝，沿路跟鄉下人　在一起。作爲掩蔽，要不，還是用部裏車子送去。無奈我們不願麻煩部裏，並且少年氣盛，沒把這些，孤羣狗黨看在眼裏。更重要的理由，我們雖說年靑，然而却是國家委派的「堂堂之師」，何必那樣鬼鬼祟祟，矯裝打扮呢？却不知道，這一着未免太有些心驕氣傲了。何以呢？幹着特務工作的人，似乎應當儘量避免一切意外麻煩；因爲我們的工作是有目標的，爲了氣盛，惹下麻煩，別的沒有什麽，萬一因此憤事，豈非失職而又悮事？</p>

<h3>揩油</h3>

<h3>猶太的恐怖組織</h3>
<p>— 問真</p>
<p>當民主獨立的烽火燃在亞洲各個角落時，流浪近二千年的以色列後裔，一定也感到飄零的痛苦，準備來一個復國運動吧！不錯，這運動在第二次世界大戰後，正在如火如荼地展開，每天在國外新聞版上，少不了關於他們復國運動的報導，諸如移民巴勒斯坦，猶阿民族衝突，英美政府由於對此運動觀點不同而發生齟齬等是。</p>
<p>領導猶太復國運動的有兩大派，一派是激進派，就是一這裏所說的恐怖組織，另一是溫和派，所謂柴恩主義（Zionism）者即屬於這一派，（柴恩是耶路撒冷的一座山名），柴恩主義，不在本文所述範圍之內，容後爲文另記，所可以預告的是後者主張用合法，民主，政治和外交的手段，達到復國的目的，至於激進派則想用武力直截地驅逐英人出境，而組織一個自由獨立的猶太祖國。</p>
<p>一九四四年十一月六日，英國駐中亞專員莫恩爵士（LordMoyne）在開羅他的別野森林中，爲兩個年輕的猶太人所暗殺，兇手一個二十七歲，一個才祇二十歲。結果是被處絞刑。之前經過一次審判，兩個兇手，常庭激昻地指責英人在巴勒斯坦措置的失當，爲此英方警告報館訪員不准將審判詳情判戰報上。可是其後消息終於洩遝，兇手終於到他們預期的目的—將世人的目光轉移到巴勒斯坦去！</p>
<p>這兩個兇手隸屬猶太恐怖組織中的司登團（Stern　Band）猶太恐怖組織有兩支，司登團是其中規模較小但最激烈的一支。</p>
<p>司登團什麼時候組成的，現在已不很淸楚，所知道的是由一個波蘭猶太人司登所創立。該團團員俱稱爲「自由以色列戰士」，專門從事個別的暗殺。其傑作有謀殺　察總監專劇省（Wilkim），高級專員莫爾客勳爵（SirMichael）,上述的莫恩博士等</p>
<p>司登是一個有毅力，狂熱的詩人，一九四二年被殺於阿剌伯牛島的單阿米物地方，死時還不到三十五歲，他的暗殺劇體，出五十個暗殺手，一百五十個助手（如情報員，宣傳員等）所組成。司登歿後，由他的副手綽號「狂熱的　曰眼睛」葉林所繼承。</p>
<p>至於恐怖組織的另一支是國民軍事團，通常給人稱爲NMO，就是該團的爲首三個英文字母。MNO由一個瘦骨嶙嶙的法科學生皮肯所領導，他善於打游擊，　　罷工和製造恐怖這一組織的武器是炸彈，他們時常集體要業英政府在巴勒斯坦的行政機構，警察，收稅吏，甚至英軍。MON的規模，實力，在在比司登團强，組成份子大部是過去波蘭軍隊裏的猶太特務隊員。一九四一至四二年，該隊由蘇俄退至中亞其中不少隊員就加入NMO，他們供給情報，利用波蘭軍用卡運送糧草彈藥，利用營帳藏匿兇手。本年七月廿二日，巴勒斯坦與英軍總部所在地的大衛王旅館，曾發生　動世界的燦炸案，就是NMO的成績。</p>
<p>猶太的恐怖組織，談到此處爲止，至於他們的復國運動，是否有阿刺伯民族的主權，那是政治家與外交家的課題。站在小百姓的立塲上，祇覺得猶太靑年，爲了復國所表現的那種慷慨就義前仆後繼的烈士精神，着實値得我們的敬仰。看到猶太民族復國的如是不易，再回顧我們好不容易抗戰成功保存下來的國家，在今日却拼命的進行內戰，實在令小百姓傷心得很。</p>

<h3>賽馬在甘肅</h3>
<p>— 幼南</p>
<p>上海資馬問題尚無下文，究竟如何，權在市府，我們姑暫不聞問，這里先談談甘肅的「賽馬」。</p>
<p>每逢舊歷新歲，在元月初六日，甘肅的番民·照例舉行賽馬會，不過他們的賽馬，儀式和作用，都與本市在租界時期　賽馬大不相同。</p>
<p>那時氣候依舊非常寒冷，又値民間閒暇無事，到了當日，番民穿了盛服，馬鞍也用金銀珠寳裝飾起來，用大紅色的綢繫着馬尾，馬頸背上的鬃毛，也分梳成幾條小辮，束以一色的綠綢。番民跨乘馬背，興高釆烈，揚場自得，集合在一處指定的廣塲上·</p>
<p>同時那些僧官喇嘛，男女百姓，步行乘馬，跟蹤而至，成了人頭擁擠，熱鬧非常。等到主持跑馬的官吏到塲之後，便當衆宣讀「活佛」旨意，說：「凡參加賽馬者，如有跌死或被馬踏斃者，均不負責任。佛法無邊，一言爲定，不幸遇有意外傷亡，則爲速登天國，不必怨恨。」</p>
<p>舉行養馬時，先分五匹馬爲一組，每兩組比賽一次，然後將各組首選的人，集合舉行決賽，奪獲冠軍者，番民紛紛趨前向他道賀，譽爲今年的「馬上英雄」，引爲光榮。還記得民國二十五年舉行賽會，英雄一席，是一個名呌「華登朵浪」的甘肅番民所奪得，他的年齡不過二十歲。</p>
<p>甘肅的賽馬，祇是一種競技述動，宗旨純正，似乎無可非議，比起目前世界各大都市，以賭博營利爲目的的賽馬，確要高尚得多了。</p>

<h3>羅斯福　如何應付史達林（2）</h3>
<p>— 法蘭絲·潘金著　葛春樑譯</p>
<p>「我覺得很失望，假使僅祇是公事公辦的紙上工作，那麼我何必不遠千里而來作此長途旅行，來應允俄國人的請求呀，他們自己不肯到美國，或是歐洲任何地方來的，於是我不得不到他們那裏來和史太林結交的，我覺得非常的失望，因爲我尋不出頭緒來如何的進行，現在我們所做到的事情，僅祇那些外交官們就可以做得到的了。</p>
<p>「我想了整整的一個晚上，我決定了要做一些絕望中逃生的事，我決不能够永遠的在德黑蘭，我必須將這冰冷的表面打破，於是以後，我可以用私人名義用電話或是信札來和他通訊的。在會談的時期，我很少單獨地會見邱吉爾因爲我有一個感覺，俄國人會以爲那是不對的，假使我和邱吉爾在談着我們所曉得的，而非他們所明瞭的。</p>
<p>「早晨，當我們到會議廳中去的時候，我追上了溫司頓（邱吉爾的名字），我僅和他說了一句話。「溫司頓，我希望你對於我將要做的事，不要因此而動氣。</p>
<p>「溫司頓把雪茄的烟灰彈了一彈，　了一聲，我必須要說的是他以後的行爲的確很好。</p>
<p>「走進了會議廳，我就立刻開始實行了，我私自地和史太林談話着。雖然一切我所說的話，都是已經說過了的，但是態度上比較親熱，比較密切，以致於另外的俄國人們都加入了來聽，却始終沒有微笑。</p>
<p>「於是，我遮起了一隻手，裝成輕聲低語的樣子，說了一句話，立刻被翻譯過去了。我說：「今天早晨，邱吉爾的性情很暴燥，因爲他醒轉來時，發覺他自已睡的是床底下。」</p>
<p>「史太林的眼裏，起了一層迷的微笑。於是，我決定了我所走的路是對的，坐在會議桌旁時，我開始惹弄着邱吉爾，譏笑他的英國態度，譏笑「約翰，水牛」（Jobn　Bull）英國人的綽號，譏笑他的雪茄，譏笑他的習慣，漸漸地使史太林起反應了。溫司頓漲紅了臉，咆哮起來了。他越是如此，史太林越是微笑。最後，史太林忍耐不住深刻地開心地大笑起來了。三天來，於是我第一次才開始看見了亮光。我繼續的燃弄着，直到他跟隨着我一同大笑了。這時，我便開始呌他「喬叔叔」（Uoce　Joe)。在上一天，他還待我像陌生人一般，但是，在他大笑的那天，他自己走過來，緊握我的手。</p>
<p>「從那個時候起，我們的關係開始密切了。史太林有時候他自己也偶然參加一二個笑話，表面上的冰是打破了，我們像普通男人般的，像兄弟般的談話着。</p>
<p>「你知道嗎？」總統繼續的說；「他是深刻地被邱吉爾從英政府帶來供獻給他的那支劍所感動着呢，那支形式華麗的劍，放在紅色鵝毛絨的氈墊上，邱吉爾說了一篇他最精彩的簡短的演講。邱吉爾他自己充滿着的情感，在說明着英國人民對俄國的奮勇作戰，和對史太林偉大的領導是如何的景仰！（未完）</p>
<h3>憶史迪威</h3>
<p>— 聖潔</p>
<p>轉戰印緬戰場的名將史迪威，在美逝世，這消息使我熱淚盈眶！</p>
<p>將軍原籍美國，但其生平的二十年都服務於中國。他熟悉中文，也懂日文，對於我國風土人情頗熟悉。因此，他對中國的認識，格外深刻。一九四二年，他再度由美來華，歷任中國戰區參謀長，中印緬戰區美軍司令，東南亞盟軍副司令等職。印緬一役中，打通了中國的新供應路綫，連接了滇緬路。這是他給予中國人民最深刻的印象。爲了紀念史將軍的豐功偉績，這一條路因而也呌做『史迪威公路」。</p>
<p>留　在印緬戰塲最有趣的一個故事，就是一個中國士兵論史將軍的幾句話，成爲了全印緬盟軍官兵茶餘酒後的談資。</p>
<p>史將軍在逝世前，雖已爲六十　外的老將，但他並沒有　一般　年人衰弱的徵象。他好似一個年靑力壯的靑年軍官。在印緬戰塲，他常戴着中國的軍帽，背着衝鋒槍，出入於槍林彈雨中，到處視察。</p>
<p>說中國話</p>
<p>有一次，史將軍在前綫視察，一個中國士兵看見了，很替這一個六十多歲的老丘八性命躭憂。士兵們談道：「這個老傢伙眞是活得太不耐煩了，存心到這兒來找死！」</p>
<p>誰知道史將軍立刻用中國官話官回答說：「我不是老傢伙，我是你們的史總指揮官。「士兵們相顧失色。</p>
<p>奔走不懈</p>
<p>他是在英國領土上指揮一支中國遠征軍的美國人，但他絕不能染指中英政治，也不讓中英政治關係，妨　他的計劃。爲了克服這許多政治上困難，他不　干幸苦、，飛越一萬八千英尺高的喜馬拉雅山。周旋能盟國當局之間。</p>
<p>他終於達到了在緬北之戰的三個目的：（一）打開一條通往中國的新供應路綫述接滇緬路；（二）摧毀日寇主力；（三）證明有適當訓練武裝及領導的中國陸軍和世界任何國好的陸軍，並無兩樣。</p>
<p>今天中國士兵和盟國的戰友，已用另一種眼光來看他了，他是盟軍每個士兵的老人，軍隊的家長，當他路過傷兵野戰醫院，總要去觀一觀中國的傷兵，用中國話慰問那些戰士。</p>
<p>在另一方面，他時常同中美士兵坐在一起吃他們的醃菜，喝他們的咖啡，和他們隨便談。在叢林小路上，史將軍的影子到處出現，當他遇見露齒微笑的中國士兵時，總要向他們交談一下。這就是他能獲得中國士兵信仰的全要因素。</p>
<p>史迪威，一個典型的民主美國的將領，他將永恒的活在中國光榮的抗戰史上！</p>

<h3>The Door to Peace Opens Further: The Government Prepares for an Immediate Ceasefire; Chairman Proposes a Three-to-Five Person Meeting First</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 14th] Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke and Political Consultative Conference (PCC) Secretary-General Shao Lizi stated today that the government is willing to issue a ceasefire order. According to President Sun, they are also reconvening the PCC Comprehensive Group and the Constitutional Draft Review Group, but with certain conditions: the Communist Party must also issue a ceasefire order, and Zhou Enlai must return to Nanjing to participate in a three-person meeting to handle various technical issues, before the government can issue the ceasefire order.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] After President Sun Ke returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 13th, he presented the consensus of opinions gathered with government representatives on national affairs to the Chairman when he was summoned on the afternoon of the 14th. The Chairman agreed, and the consensus was to be conveyed by PCC Secretary-General Lei Zhen via special train to the various parties in Shanghai tonight. Whether there will be a turning point in the situation will depend on the response from Shanghai. A decision is expected within a day or two. Those summoned by the Chairman at his official residence on the afternoon of the 14th were Sun Ke, Shao Lizi, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Shijie, Chen Bulei, Chen Lifu, Zhang Lisheng, Wu Dingchang, and Lei Zhen. Sun Ke reported on his meetings with various parties in Shanghai and the opinions they offered, as well as the results of yesterday's discussions. After listening to the report, the Chairman gave instructions and summoned Lei Zhen again at 5:00 PM for further instructions. This newspaper's reporter specifically visited President Sun at his private residence at 8:00 PM in the afternoon, who made the following remarks: "During my visit to Shanghai, I met with people from various parties, and many opinions were provided. However, the National Army's entry into Zhangjiakou on the 11th of this month and the announcement of the National Assembly convocation order the following day led some people to believe that the government had closed the door to peace and that further negotiations were impossible. Upon my return to Nanjing, I explained this to the government and awaited their opinion. The view in Shanghai is not entirely correct. Although the National Assembly convocation order has been issued, there are still over twenty days before the meeting, and if negotiations are possible, it is not too late. The most urgent matters for negotiation are: 1. Cessation of military conflict; 2. Government reorganization; 3. Participation of all parties in the National Assembly; 4. The issue of constitutional draft amendments. I will explain each separately as follows: First, the government is not only willing to negotiate a cessation of military conflict but also desires it as soon as possible. However, a ceasefire is a matter for both sides. In the past, both sides had agreements and issued ceasefire orders, but they could not be maintained, and military conflict remained unavoidable. Therefore, it is now necessary to find a thorough ceasefire solution. Both sides must negotiate and reach an agreement that both sides adhere to in order to achieve lasting peace. Therefore, in order to discuss the ceasefire issue, a three-person military conference must be convened immediately to implement the ceasefire as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Hoping Zhou Enlai Returns to Beijing and Immediately Participates in Negotiations</p>
<p>We also hope that Zhou Enlai will come to Beijing immediately to attend and participate in the negotiations. Second, regarding the reorganization of the government, Ambassador Stuart proposed convening an informal five-person group to specifically discuss the issue of government reorganization. When the suggestion was made, Zhou Enlai expressed his agreement, but it eventually stalled. Now it should be realized. After an agreement is reached, the PCC Comprehensive Group can be convened. In this way, the matter of participating in the National Assembly and submitting a list of names can be resolved sequentially. Third, the purpose of convening the National Assembly is to enact a constitution. The PCC Constitutional Draft Review Committee has been meeting and studying at any time since early February. The entire constitutional draft has been discussed. However, before the return to the capital, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had stated that even if the constitutional draft went through the review process, it should still be reserved in its entirety. The government also expressed agreement. Therefore, although the study is complete, it cannot be established without mutual agreement. Therefore, the Constitutional Draft Review Committee should be convened immediately to continue its unfinished task and submit it to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process before submitting it to the National Assembly for enactment." Sun continued that the most important military matters are ceasefire, reorganization, and unified command, which must be negotiated by a three-person military group. In the political field, a five-person group should discuss government reorganization. Once an agreement is reached, the government can implement the reorganization. If an agreement can be reached on everything before the National Assembly convenes, the National Assembly can be held under the new government after reorganization. Finally, Sun emphasized that the door to peace is not only not closed, but is even more open. He hopes that the Communist Party, the Democratic League, and various other parties will return to Beijing as soon as possible to conduct the meetings of the various groups. What I presented to the government upon my return to Beijing were the points mentioned above. The various parties must proceed according to these steps in order to achieve a solution to all the problems. I believe that the future is very promising. The reporter then took his leave. It is understood that these opinions have been approved by the Chairman.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] With peace talks stalled, the two ambassadors, Stuart and Ma, have been less active. On the afternoon of the 14th, at 2:30 PM, British Ambassador Stevenson visited Ambassador Stuart for nearly an hour. Ambassador Stuart then visited Soviet Ambassador Petrov. An hour later, he visited Foreign Minister Wang at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and revisited Special Envoy Ma, returning at 7:00 PM. Ambassador Stuart is scheduled to visit Hangzhou on the 18th and return to Beijing on the 21st, reportedly accompanied by Berg.</p>
<h3>Lei Zhen's Mission to Shanghai: To Visit Representatives of Various Parties</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] PCC Secretary-General Lei Zhen traveled to Shanghai by car tonight. It is understood that Lei will visit representatives of various parties in Shanghai to exchange views on the current situation.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] After the recovery of Zhangjiakou, the CCP in Shanghai has remained silent. However, many believe that the door to peace has not been closed. After Youth Party leader Li Huang returned to Shanghai from Beijing, he convened a meeting of the leaders of the Third Force remaining in Shanghai at the Youth Party headquarters on Haig Road late the night before last. Huang Yanpei was ill, Qian Xinbo did not go out at night due to foot problems, and Guo Moruo was too far away in Hongkou to attend, so only Zeng Qi, Chen Qitian, Zuo Shunsheng, Yang Yongjun, and Li Huang of the Youth Party, and Luo Longji, Zhang Junli, Shen Junru, Liang Shuming, and Zhang Bojun of the Democratic League attended. Li Huang gave a report during the meeting. Yesterday morning, the government's PCC representatives also held talks in Beijing and reported the results of the talks to the Chairman. PCC Secretary-General Lei Zhen rushed to Shanghai yesterday afternoon and visited Zuo Shunsheng to discuss matters at 10:00 PM. Observers generally believe that Lei has notified the Third Force in Shanghai of the resolutions of the government's PCC representatives.</p>
<p>According to a certain PCC representative of the Third Force who has participated in previous talks: If the government is unwilling to include the Third Force and convenes the National Assembly as scheduled, or if the CCP withdraws from negotiations and launches a guerrilla war, it would not be a proper way to solve the problem, even for the sake of both sides. On the contrary, if it can be done appropriately and the PCC group is convened first, the Third Force has no reason to refuse to participate. The PCC Act proposal was jointly signed by thirty-eight representatives of various parties, and they should all abide by it. There is no other way to follow.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] After taking the oath of office, Party Headquarters Director Fang, along with Secretary-General Xie Renzhao and Committee Member Chen Hua, visited the leaders of various parties in Shanghai for the first time yesterday afternoon. They met with Zhou Enlai and urged him to go to Beijing as soon as possible to discuss peace plans. At the same time, they visited Zuo Shunsheng, Zhang Junli, Zeng Qi, Shen Junru, and Zhang Bojun, hoping to promote peace and unity and jointly participate in the National Assembly.</p>
<h3>CCP Delegation Denies Imminent Departure from Nanjing</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Liang Shuming visited Lei Zhen on the morning of the 14th to protest against newspaper reports about the Communist Party registering unemployed employees of the Democratic League. He visited Mo Dehui in the afternoon for a long conversation. There was talk of Mo going to Shanghai. The CCP delegation had no activities on the 14th. The spokesperson only made the following two points of clarification: First, they deny that the CCP office is withdrawing from Nanjing. Second, they deny that the CCP has declared a proactive, comprehensive breakdown.</p>
<h3>Stilwell's Remains to be Cremated</h3>
<p>Ashes to be Scattered in the Pacific</p>

<p>Premier Soong's Condolence Telegram [Central News Agency, Qingdao, 14th] Premier Soong Ziwen, recuperating in Qingdao, was deeply saddened to hear of General Stilwell's death. He sent a telegram of condolence to General Stilwell's wife. The telegram read: "To Mrs. Stilwell, deeply saddened to hear of General Stilwell's passing. The Chinese people will never forget General Stilwell's contributions to China."</p>
<h3>Draft of Sino-American Commercial Treaty Finalized</h3>
<p>Executive Yuan to Decide on Signing Date Today</p>

<h3>Hong Lanyou Visits Yu Dawei to Discuss Air Transport of National Assembly Representatives; Reporters to be Included in the Invited Group</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, has been extremely busy preparing for the National Assembly. He held meetings all day on the 13th. Hong told reporters on the evening of the 14th that the work of the Assembly's news group will be handled by the Central Propaganda Department. The News Group will be responsible for allowing reporters to attend and listen. The original plan for 120 reporter seats has been expanded to avoid disappointment. Hong also said that reporters would be included in the invited group for this Assembly. Although they will not receive the same treatment as the representatives, they can enjoy equal convenience, making their status at the Assembly comparable to that of reporters attending some international conferences. A special lounge for reporters is set up next to the Assembly hall. Each major newspaper will have more than one seat. The Assembly hall will be completely decorated by the end of the month, at which time reporters will be invited to visit and report. The Preparatory Committee will end its work the month before, and the Assembly Secretariat will handle the opening of the Assembly. Regarding transportation for representatives from various locations to Beijing, Hong discussed it with Minister Yu Jiaju on the morning of the 14th, and there should be no problem. In addition to China and Central Airlines, the Air Transport Brigade can also assist. The locations and times for representatives from various places to gather will be announced soon. There are approximately three gathering points in each province, with Xuzhou, Zhenjiang, and Shanghai for Jiangsu. Notifications have been sent to the representatives today to prepare to gather. Regarding the list of National Assembly members, Hong said that a portion can be officially announced by the National Government on the 15th. The lists of the various parties are still being urged.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] After the convocation order for the National Assembly was issued as scheduled, the attitudes of the various parties have not been fully clarified, and the future of the peace talks is still unclear. When the reporter inquired with a certain authoritative source, it was said that the government is absolutely determined to convene the National Assembly as scheduled and still hopes that the various parties will participate as scheduled. Negotiations on this matter have been underway recently, and there may be considerable results. If they cannot gather as scheduled, it is fortunate that the Assembly period is very long, and they can participate at any time. It was also said that all parties are still working hard on the peace talks. The government is enduring for the sake of the country, and it is expected that there will be concessions in the political field. If the Communist Party prioritizes the country, it will not tend towards extremism.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting on the Pinggu Line</h3>

<h3>Calm on the Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] As the great battle in Chahar comes to an end, the northern section of the Pinghan Railway is showing a calm before the storm. The National Army's forces are gradually increasing, while the Communist Army is holding its ground. Both sides seem to be preparing. Last night, a section of the railway south of Zhuozhou was damaged. Trains southward to Zhuozhou and northward from Shijiazhuang are running to Dingzhou on the 14th, but the Xinle Railway Bridge requires pedestrian connection.</p>
<h3>Communist Army in Suide, Northern Shaanxi, Attacks the Border of Yulin; Communist Army Raiding Old City of Gui Sui Suppressed</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Tianjin, 14th] Wu Daifeng, commander of the Communist Army's Suide Garrison in northern Shaanxi, recently led more than 20,000 troops to invade the border of Yulin, advancing towards Zhenchuanbao and Wuzhen, Hengshan, which are 130 li from Yulin. The National Army intercepted and resisted, and fighting has been ongoing since the 13th. Many believe that the Communist Army intends to capture Yulin. The Yulin military authorities are properly planning defenses.</p>

<h3>National Army Units on Both Banks of the Grand Canal Have Converged at Sishui Town</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Huaiyin, 13th] On the 12th, National Army units from both the north and south ends along the Grand Canal in northern Jiangsu converged at Sishui Town (north of Jieshou) between Gaoyou and Xianying. On the 13th, several refugees from Lianshui came north from Yangzhou by land and arrived in Huaiyin. It is estimated here that once this route is open, the refugees gathered in Nanjing, Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, and other places will return to their homes in large numbers in a short period of time. Therefore, relief work urgently requires the full cooperation of all parties.

<h3>Armistice Along the Jiaoji Railway Line</h3>
<p>Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu Retreats Back into Shandong Province</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Jinan, 13th] The Jiaoji Railway line has entered a temporary armistice. Although the Communist Army in eastern Shandong has withdrawn from the transportation lines, 20,000 to 30,000 troops remain in the area 8 to 12 kilometers south and north of Gaomi, with the intention of launching further military operations at any time. Traffic along the Jiaoji Railway line is now completely under the control of the National Army. Cars can travel directly between Jinan and Qingdao by the middle of next month, but full train service will have to wait until around the New Year. In the areas recovered by the National Army in southwestern Shandong, local order has been largely stabilized. The Yang Yong unit of the Communist Army's Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region, totaling 30,000 to 40,000 troops, has withdrawn from southwestern Shandong and gathered in the Fanxian, Shouzhang, and Yanggu areas of northwestern Shandong, preparing to resist the National Army heading north. The New Fourth Army, which went to northern Jiangsu to fight, is also gradually retreating back to Shandong. Its First Division recently passed through Linyi and headed north, reaching the Yishui area, apparently for replenishment and reorganization. Its future intentions are still difficult to determine.</p>
<h3>Commander Sun Lianzhong Returns to Beiping from the Front Lines</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] Sun Lianzhong, commander of the Eleventh War Zone, has been traveling back and forth between the front lines and Beiping for days, extremely fatigued. He returned from the front lines last night, his feet muddy, and reported to Chief of Staff Chen immediately without resting. According to someone familiar with the Chahar campaign, the Communist Army's greatest failure was in its lack of strategic understanding, focusing only on the front and neglecting the emptiness behind, which led to Fu Zuoyi's troops advancing rapidly and descending from the north in one fell swoop. On the Zhangjiakou-Huailai front, although the Communist Army's frontal resistance was strong, the National Army's left and right wings encircled and bypassed Huailai, entering the Xiahuayuan in one fell swoop, forming a large encirclement. More than 30,000 Communist troops were annihilated within this encirclement, with more than half being溃灭, which was another major miscalculation by the Communist Army. The Communist Army originally planned to send a division to cut off the Pinghan Railway and threaten Tianjin and Beiping to achieve a diversionary effect, but the result was only minor disturbances on the Pinghan Railway, and they did not dare to spy on Tianjin and Beiping. This plan also failed.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng remained in Beiping on the 14th and went out to inspect at one point. He was originally scheduled to leave Beiping and return to Nanjing on the 15th, but he may delay it by one day because he is rushing to complete the official business under his direction.</p>
<h3>Beining Railway Line Damaged; All Train Services Suspended Yesterday</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Tianjin, 14th] The Beining Railway Line suffered extensive damage by the Communist Army from the evening of the 13th to the morning of the 14th. All train services on the Tianjin-Yuhua section were suspended on the 14th. The damage included: (1) Twelve power poles were cut down between Anding and Wanzhuang on the way from Tianjin.

<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] Sources stated that the Fu Zuoyi and Sun Lianzhong units of the National Army in eastern Chahar converged east of Xuanhua last night, but according to the Twelfth War Zone, there are still strongholds between Xuanhua and Xiahuayuan that have not been recovered, so the two armies may have converged on the evening of the 14th. In other news, the National Army that recovered Huailai and Xiahuayuan has sent a division south in pursuit and will soon recover Zhuolu. The Du Yuming unit that recovered Duolun has rushed to Zhangjiakou and converged with the Fu Zuoyi unit. It is also reported that the Fu unit advancing west from Zhangjiakou is approaching Chaigoubu and will soon converge with another unit advancing east from the western section of the Ping Sui Railway.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 14th] After the National Army on the Ping Sui Line completely recovered Huailai on the 13th, the Communist Army in the Huailai-Yanqing area fled into the mountains north of Huailai and west of Yanqing, while the main force fled southwest of Huailai into the 　Shanbao area. The National Army has advanced west past Tumubao and Sangyuan.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Guisui, 13th] The Communist Army near Zhangjiakou has collapsed towards Weixian through Kongjiazhuang and Zuo Weicheng. The city's electricity, water, and the important buildings of Qinghe Bridge have been completely destroyed. The station only has one freight car. The two airfields about 15 li from the city were also destroyed. After the engineers rushed to repair them, planes landed on the 13th. The Communist Army Security Brigade that surrendered in Shangdu automatically organized a anti-traitor group and destroyed the administrative organization of the Communist Party's seven districts. Lu Ping, the Communist County Chief of Wuyun, recently led 200 Communist troops to brutally kill people who responded to the National Army in Liangcheng Changhanying.

The towns northwest of Datong have fallen into the hands of the Communist Army, and fierce fighting is expected soon. A large number of National Army troops have been rushing north from southern Shanxi to reinforce Datong and relieve the siege.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 14th] The Communist Army is attacking Datong again from the north and northwest of the city. Although the Communist side claims that Datong is isolated again, a spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense said that the Communist Army's new offensive against Datong is not a serious threat, because the strength of the Communist Army in that section of northern Shanxi does not exceed 5,000 men.</p>
<h3>Frequent Communist Army Movements in Northern Shanxi</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] According to sources, amidst the National Army's advance on Zhangjiakou, the Communist Army in northern Shanxi is moving frequently. The He Long unit, which collapsed from Jining and Fengzhen to Zuoyun and Youyu, has been reorganized and moved to the area south of Huairen, numbering approximately 6,000 to 7,000. The Communist Army has also transferred more than 3,000 troops from the vicinity of Zhouzhuang north of Shanyin. Approximately 6,000 Communist troops have also gathered in the area near Hunyuan, all of whom are actively building fortifications and conscripting grain and labor, attempting to defend the corridor from northern Shaanxi to the Taihang Mountains.</p>
<h3>Minister Bai Reports on Military Reorganization, Declaring He Does Not Wish to Eliminate the Communist Army, Hoping They Will Not Seize Territory and Obstruct Peace</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The Central Memorial Week was held at 9:00 AM on the 14th. Chairman Chiang himself led the ceremony. Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi attended and reported on military affairs. Bai first discussed the reorganization of the army after the victory of the War of Resistance. He stated that the purpose of military reorganization is to establish a modern army, navy, and air force to defend the country. The reorganization work south of the Longhai Railway has been underway, and the troops north of the Longhai Railway should also be reorganized. Unfortunately, the Communist Army did not abide by repeated ceasefire agreements, raised troops and created chaos, and even attacked Nantong, almost threatening Nanjing and Shanghai. The government had the Battle of Northern Jiangsu to protect the local area and the people. Bai then reported on the military situation on the Longhai, Jiaoji, Tongpu, and Tianjin-Beiping lines. He continued that the soldiers across the country, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang and the command of Chief of Staff Chen, were forced to use troops, but the ultimate goal is still peaceful reunification and the implementation of the nationalization of the army, not allowing any one person or party to have its own army. Therefore, militarily speaking, we do not want to eliminate the Communist Army, but only hope that the Communist Army will be reorganized into the national army, will not seize territory, and will not hinder the work of restoring transportation, so as to achieve peaceful reunification as soon as possible and establish a new country of the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<h3>Zheng Jiemin to Return to Beijing</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] Zheng Jiemin, the government member of the Military Mediation Headquarters, will return to Beijing to report on his work within a day or two. Ji Lun began working at the headquarters on the 14th. The personnel on the Communist side appear quite deserted.</p>
<h3>The United States Should Help Chairman Chiang Establish a Coalition Government</h3>
<p>Commentary in the New York Times</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 13th] The New York Times wrote in its commentary today that the Communist Party's loss of Zhangjiakou was the most serious failure since the end of the war. The United States should fully assist Chairman Chiang in establishing a feasible coalition government. Marshall will not return home, and the United States will not withdraw its small number of troops stationed in China. We can and must hope to obtain some kind of Chinese-style compromise to save "face." The greatest difficulty is mixing two opposing ideals in a democratic government. Although the political ideals of the two sides are very different, Chairman Chiang is above the two parties. He has made some concessions and sincerely wants to establish a feasible coalition government.</p>
<h3>Cü Zheng's Resignation Intent Firm</h3>
<p>Vice President Qin Zhen Also Submits Resignation</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Judiciary Yuan President Cü Zheng's recent submission of his resignation to the Executive Committee and the National Government Chairman Jiang, indicates a rather resolute intention to retire. His resignation had already been drafted a month ago. Recently, with the term of office of the National Government Committee expiring on National Day, he formally submitted it to the highest authorities. He himself expressed to those around him that he believed it would certainly be approved. It is heard that if Cü retires, his possible successors will be Zhang Ji, Wang Huijü, or Zou Lu. However, it is generally believed that before the National Congress is convened, his resignation will likely not be accepted by the highest authorities, as Chairman Jiang and Cü have a very close friendship. On the eve of National Day, he personally visited him at the Central Hospital in a light car with a small entourage, and they spoke at length for about fifteen minutes. Furthermore, the 17th of this month (the 23rd day of the ninth lunar month) is Cü's seventy-first birthday. Cü will soon return to his ancestral home in Guangji for a visit.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] Judiciary Yuan Vice President Qin Zhen, since being transferred from the Vice President of the Legislative Yuan to his current position, was elected as a member of the National Government Committee in the thirty-second year of the Republic. He concurrently served as the Vice President of the Yuan. Recently, due to the expiration of his term as a committee member and being plagued by old age and illness, he decided to retire on his own initiative. He has submitted requests to the Central Committee and the National Government Chairman Jiang, to resign from his position as a member of the National Government Committee, as well as from his substantive and concurrent positions as Vice President of the Court. It is said that he has also requested to resign from his concurrent position as Chairman of the Central Government Employees Disciplinary Committee.</p>

<h3>US-UK-Soviet Potsdam Agreement Secret Parts Should Be Published - Request of the US Policy Association</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] The US Policy Association, on the 13th, issued a letter through its treasurer, Kerber, requesting President Truman to publicly announce the rumored "secret Potsdam Agreement concerning China." The association stated that the existence of this agreement "has been confirmed to this association by the State Department." However, the State Department officially denies this point. Mr. Kerber published the correspondence between the association and the State Department to prove the secret agreement concerning China made by Stalin, Truman, and Attlee at the third Potsdam Conference in 1945. According to the letter, the US Policy Association, in a letter to Secretary of State Acheson, accused the secret Potsdam Agreement of containing the following provisions: (1) Outer Mongolia's separation from China, which violates the terms of the Yalta Secret Agreement. (2) The division of Korea. (3) Granting the Soviet Union extra reparations from Northeast China. (4) Forcing the Chinese government to accept the Chinese Communist Party organization into a coalition government without dissolving or merging the CCP's original army. (5) If the United States cannot compel China to implement items 1, 3, and 4, then the Soviet Union will take action and be solely responsible. The China Desk of the State Department denied the above-mentioned specific provisions, stating that they "have no factual basis," but did not explicitly deny the existence of a certain secret agreement. According to the letter revealed by Kerber, he wrote to the State Department twice, on September 13th and 26th, stating that based on the State Department's reply, he believed it sufficient to prove that there was indeed a secret agreement concerning China at the Potsdam Conference. He asked the State Department whether this interpretation was incorrect, but the State Department has not replied. However, today, a responsible official of the State Department related to this matter told reporters that "no agreement concerning China was concluded" at the Potsdam Conference. At the same time, the State Department does not intend to notify the association of this view again.</p>

This time, I was also able to pay my respects to Chairman Jiang and his wife, which I will always remember. I have never felt like a stranger in your country, because about seven years ago, when my husband, Mr. Cripps, met with Chairman Jiang in Chongqing, the Chinese people treated him with such friendship and care, as if I were there myself. Now I am about to begin visiting various parts of your country, and the convenience you have given me has given me the courage to observe all aspects of the lives of your people, and I hope to improve them. Britain will deeply appreciate this expression of your friendship. I very much hope that upon returning to Nanjing, I can report to you everything I have seen. Furthermore, I believe that being able to enter the interior of China is the greatest experience that anyone could hope for."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] Lady Cripps and her party arrived safely at Jiulongpo Airport at 2:30 p.m. today.

In addition to admiration, I cannot help but recall the necessity and value of Sino-British friendship. I am very grateful for the warm welcome I have received from all parties during this visit to China. Later, the reporters asked questions, and Lady Cripps and the General Secretary of the Association, Mrs. Miller, replied, saying: The future direction of the British Aid China Association's work will depend on the entire economic environment of the British Empire. The funds they donate do not come from wealthy merchants, but from ordinary British citizens who are sympathetic to China, accumulating small amounts into large ones. However, they will continue to maintain the donation of one penny per week from 780,000 people and other fundraising. This donation is purely raised for the people, regardless of party affiliation and without political overtones. Therefore, she will go to the Communist area on the 27th or 28th at the invitation of Zhou Enlai to inspect various military hospitals that receive this donation.</p>

<h3>Fuxin Coal Mine in Rehe Province - Reserves are the Largest in the Far East - The Government Allocates 70 Billion for Development</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tianjin, 14th] Local newspapers report that during the occupation of Rehe Province, the Japanese spent a large sum of money and considerable time and effort to increase coal production at the Fuxin Coal Mine in Rehe Province. Today, it has become the coal mine with the richest reserves and the greatest hope in the Far East. It will be managed by the Resources Committee. The government has allocated 70 billion yuan as the first batch of funds, and the rest is still under negotiation. The main purpose of the allocation is to purchase the necessary machinery and equipment, which has been ordered from the United States. Mining experts from the United States have also been hired. The mine currently employs 10,000 workers and produces 5,400 tons of coal per day.</p>
<h3>Our Tungsten Production - Efforts are Being Made to Increase It</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Our country has the most tungsten production and the best quality. A person in charge of the Foreign Trade Office of the Resources Committee recently told a reporter: Our country's tungsten production is gradually increasing. In the year since the victory, production has not increased compared to before the war due to political instability and unstable prices. Because tungsten is one of the important non-ferrous metals in heavy industry, the government has always controlled it from before the war to the present. Merchants are not allowed to transport it freely, and its sales are managed by the Foreign Trade Office. It is one of our country's important exports in the international trade market. Therefore, the mines in the tungsten producing areas are all state-owned. Tungsten ore can be refined and then exported, but because the cost is high, only tungsten ore is exported. It is transported to countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. In addition, the production and sales of zinc are also state-owned, and free trade is not allowed. Our country's smelting technology for antimony is quite good, and it can be smelted to 99.9%. Ordinary countries only smelt antimony to 99.75%. Therefore, from a technical point of view, our country is not inferior to foreign countries. Only after the overall national economy stabilizes, will the production and sales of this rare metal be of considerable benefit to the country's income.</p>
<h3>Northeast Cement Industry</h3>
<p>Of the Original Fourteen Factories Including Jilin, Less Than Half Now Remain</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 14th] In the past, the cement industry in the Northeast, operated by the Japanese, included fourteen factories: Dalian, Jilin, Liaoyang, Fushun, Benxi Lake, Harbin, Quanzhou, Anshan, Jinxi, Miyahara, Miaoling, Andong, Mudanjiang, and Xiaotun. The highest annual output reached 2.16 million tons, exceeding the total output of all cement plants within the customs. Currently, the Jilin, Quanzhou, and Miyahara factories have been completely destroyed. The Harbin, Dalian, and Mudanjiang factories are still in the hands of the Communists. The Anshan factory has been destroyed by more than 60%. The Jinxi, Liaoyang, and Fushun factories have machines that are mostly outdated. The damage to other factories is relatively minor. It is estimated that after resumption of work, the output will be less than half of what it was in the past, but within the country, it will still occupy a significant position.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xiaomei to Go Abroad Tomorrow to Inspect the Economy</h3>
<p>First Flies to Japan, Then to the United States</p>
<p>[This City News] Dr. Zhang Xiaomei, a specialist member of the Supreme National Defense Council, has recently been dispatched by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to inspect overseas economies. He is scheduled to take a US transport plane tomorrow (16th) to Tokyo first, where he will stay for ten weeks to observe Japan's post-war recovery. He will then transfer to New York and Washington, with an estimated itinerary of about six months in the United States. He will also take the opportunity to visit Europe.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Zhang's conversation with reporters, the economic construction of our country must grasp two points: (1) Average national income, (2) Balance of international payments. The method of averaging national income, whether movable or immovable property, should adopt a system of one name per person, one name per household. In addition, scientific methods should be implemented for household registration, and thorough surveys and statistics should be conducted. As for balancing international payments, the current countermeasures are (1) Encouraging exports, (2) Promoting thrift, (3) Reducing consumption. However, whether in terms of quality or cost, domestic goods and foreign goods ultimately cannot compete. The remaining solutions are to quickly seek currency stability and lower bank interest rates. Other essential measures include attracting the import of industrial machinery and promoting local products. In other words, there can never be too many means of production, and there is no shame in a lack of consumer goods. Furthermore, our domestic goods merchants should pay attention to the Southeast Asian market in addition to domestic sales and seize positions before Japanese industry recovers.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Expectations for the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>Fang Zhi, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, and the newly appointed committee members, held a swearing-in ceremony yesterday at the Shanghai Stadium. At the same time, all circles in Shanghai held an expanded Commemoration Week for the Premier. Starting with Wu Jingheng, the central oath administrator, each person gave a speech. Director Fang also clearly declared that he would complete the revolution in a political party style and realize the party's principles with a revolutionary spirit, which is enough to make the party members in this city recognize the path they should strive for in the future. No fewer than five or six hundred people attended the ceremony yesterday, and the newspaper received a new impression that the style of the Kuomintang would undergo a change.</p>
<p>Originally, Kuomintang members are a group of people who firmly believe in and fight for the Three Principles of the People. If they take "vanguard for the people" as their mission, they should stand in front of the people and guide them; if they believe that "life is for service," they should not seek fame or profit, but work hard and serve the people. Regardless of which concept is held, party members must be close to the people, and the party headquarters must be a home for party members. Those in charge of party affairs must not regard only a certain number of staff within the fire door of the party headquarters as their cadres, but should regard all party members as cadres for all their work; moreover, since the party stands in front of the people and serves the people, the party's work should be the work that the people urgently need. In other words, what the party wants to do is what the people want to do, and the people should also be the cadres of all the party's work.</p>
<p>If the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters can establish a new style in the future, encourage the party members in the city, and even inspire the people in the city, without being narrow or biased, and take what the people like as what they like and what the people hate as what they hate as the standard, and move forward bravely, then we dare to believe that all the party members in the city and even all the people in the city will be happy to use them, and the party's talents will be inexhaustible. What we expect from the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters is nothing greater than this.</p>
<h3>The Completion of the New French Constitution</h3>
<p>The French Constituent Assembly passed the draft of the French Constitution on the 29th of last month, and it was submitted to a referendum for a vote the day before yesterday. According to the results of the vote counts in various provinces of the headquarters, as of the time of this author's writing, 9,143,310 people voted in favor of the new draft constitution, and 8,084,067 people voted against it. It is no longer a question that the new draft constitution of France will be passed by a referendum. The result of this referendum can not only bring an end to the temporary political system in France after the war, but also determine the form of French politics, and even affect the evolution of the entire European political situation, so people all over the world are paying close attention to this French referendum.</p>
<p>Since France gained its liberation, it has maintained a temporary political system. Although French politicians have made great efforts to create the newest and most democratic constitution, it was ultimately overthrown in a referendum on May 5th of this year. As a result, the French head of state is still called the interim president. However, in recent months, France has faced many problems that urgently need to be resolved, both in domestic and foreign affairs; therefore, the general public is eager for the temporary political system to end as soon as possible and to embark on the normal track of constitutional government, so that these problems can be easily resolved. Therefore, the leaders of the three major political parties in France (namely the Catholic Progressive Party, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party) have done their utmost to compromise in the Constituent Assembly, and finally drafted another new draft constitution and submitted it to a referendum to show the support of public opinion; at the same time, the leaders of the three major political parties also instructed the members and masses of their respective parties to unanimously support this new draft constitution. Logically, it should not be a problem for this new draft constitution to be passed by a referendum; however, on the eve of the referendum, the anti-Japanese war hero General de Gaulle gave speeches in various places, attacking this new draft constitution and appealing to the citizens to vote against it, which can certainly sway the opinions of some citizens, especially members of the Catholic Progressive Party. Therefore, people are not too optimistic about whether the fate of this new draft constitution will be accepted by the general public.</p>
<p>Because of his merits in leading the anti-Japanese war, General de Gaulle has an unshakable position in the minds of the general French people. According to the results of testing French public opinion, those who support de Gaulle as leader account for 35%, which is unmatched by any political party leader. However, in today's France, which has suffered from the German ravages and destruction during the war, its vitality has been damaged and has not yet recovered, so since liberation, the urgency of famine, the lack of materials, the obstruction of transportation, the soaring prices, and the social unrest have all been very serious problems; in addition, the international situation has not improved, the creation of world peace is not easy, the confrontation between the Anglo-American group and the Slavic group, and where France will go are even more difficult to solve. Although de Gaulle has military strategy and leadership every day, it is questionable whether he has the means of a politician and diplomat. These current referendum situations are fully exposed. The first is the large number of citizens who abstained, nearly 30%. The lack of enthusiasm of French citizens in the referendum is enough to show the French people's suffering from politics, and they feel deeply at a loss in the gap between the struggles between the left and right factions. Second, there is little difference between those who approve and those who disapprove. From this, we can also know that de Gaulle's position among the people cannot be underestimated. If General de Gaulle continues to engage in political struggles in the future, then the political tide in France will be just beginning, making us have to take some reservations about the future of French politics.</p>
<p>The clauses of the new French constitution have not yet been published, and its contents are not yet very clear; however, this new constitution is the result of a compromise between the three major political parties in France. The differences of opinion from all parties have been reduced to a minimum in the constitution, so it is by no means accidental that it can still be passed by a majority of citizens despite de Gaulle's opposition. Among political parties, it is truly worth our reference today to be able to resolve all political disputes through peaceful negotiation, finally reach an agreement, complete a new constitution, and then pass it by referendum, so that French politics can move from a temporary political system to the normal track of constitutional government.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Price Controls</h3>
<p>There are two purposes of price controls: one is to stabilize prices, and the other is to rationally allocate resources. To achieve the first purpose, first, all materials must be controlled; second, production mechanisms must be fully and continuously utilized.</p>
<p>To achieve the second purpose, first, the targets of consumption must be identified; second, distribution mechanisms must be sound; third, there must be sufficient authority.</p>
<p>If the above premises are not mistaken, then it is virtually impossible to achieve true control without escaping the following situations and intentions:</p>
<p>(1) Fair prices in name, making money in reality; constantly racing against the black market.</p>
<p>(2) The object of distribution is the materials currently in hand, not the appropriate needs of the other party.</p>
<p>(3) There are too few materials to meet the demand.</p>
<p>(4) Materials cannot be unified, and there is a free market in addition to rationing.</p>
<p>(5) Only manages distribution, not production, resulting in a disconnect between production and sales, and problems with sources, or production prices and distribution prices cannot be matched.</p>
<p>(6) Rationed goods cannot be controlled and flow into the black market one after another.</p>
<p>(7) The object of consumption has not been clarified, resulting in improper distribution, or distribution for the wrong purpose.</p>
<p>(8) Unsound personnel, lack of unified authority, and the control itself causes problems.</p>
<p>(9) The economy has no boundaries, but the control pressure is limited to one corner.</p>
<p>(10) There is fundamentally no determination or preparation for control, but it is only to deceive people in the face of the current situation.</p>
<p>(11) Or using the name of control to implement some kind of monopoly attempt.</p>
<p>Now the control agencies are increasing day by day. In terms of their nature, some are handled by the central government, some are handled by local governments, and some are handled by semi-official and semi-commercial entities. But whether the above-mentioned defects can be avoided as much as possible is naturally clearer to the authorities and does not require us to worry too much. However, once it is held, we very much hope to strive for perfection and achieve the expected purpose. Otherwise, the more you try to sort it out, the more confused it becomes, only deepening the difficulties of those involved, undermining the credibility of the government, and the general public may not be able to get practical benefits, which is really not worth the loss. There have been too many past failures with methods such as fair prices, price limits, and rationing. Facts have proven that simply talking official language does not have much effect on economic measures. Therefore, don't talk about control, but if you want to talk about control, you can't have a simple-minded mentality, and you can't ignore economic factors.</p>

<h3>Eliminating Pirates Promotes Fisheries: Zhejiang Province Strengthens Maritime Police Force; Requests Allocation of Vessels, Loan of Ten Billion</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 14th] Pi Zuoyi, Director of the Zhejiang Construction Department, and Li Xing, Section Chief of the First Section, returned to Hangzhou yesterday after going to Shanghai to discuss fisheries, water conservancy, transportation, and other matters in Zhejiang Province. According to Mr. Pi, speaking to our reporter, the main task of this trip was to purchase fishing boats, discuss the Qiantang River Ferry, the Xixing Wharf, and negotiate with the Executive Yuan for construction funds and flour. In addition to purchasing five L.C.M. landing craft from the Materials Supply and Sales Office at a price of US$5,000 each, the China Aquatic Products Company is willing to lend two vessels free of charge, but they need slight repairs. Zhejiang Reclamation Company and Zhejiang Haiyu Fisheries Company can each lease one vessel, totaling nine vessels. In addition to the two landing craft that will be allocated to the Qiantang River Ferry, the remaining seven vessels will be listed as fishing protection vessels. Four vessels will be sent to Ningbo, and three vessels will be allocated to the coastal areas of Wenzhou and Taizhou. The above-mentioned vessels are all under 100 tons. Although they are not as ideal as 160 tons, equipped with light and heavy machine guns, together with the original two vessels in Dinghai, and allocated to the maritime police of the four detachments, they will be enough to make the pirates who have plagued the coast of Zhejiang for a long time have nowhere to hide. The coast of Zhejiang is the largest fishing ground in our country, and the fishing season is in November and December. In order to promote the development of the fishing industry and protect the safety of fishermen, the above-mentioned fishing protection vessels can go to sea at the end of October, so that pirates can be contained. The Zhejiang Provincial Government is also in contact with the Executive Yuan, requesting the Joint Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to allocate materials for 5,000 wooden sailboats and 500 engines, so that they can be used by fishermen during the fishing season at the end of the year. In order to take care of the welfare of fishermen, the Provincial Government is negotiating with the Farmers Bank of China for a fishing loan of ten billion yuan in order to turn around funds and repair fishing gear. As for the Qiantang River Ferry and the Xixing Wharf, raising funds will not be a problem. Mr. Mao Yisheng has been invited to Hangzhou for inspection, so that he can design and construct them. In terms of water conservancy and transportation, some permanent projects will be reported to the central government in Nanjing for instructions to determine the overall plan.</p>
<h3>It is rumored that Jingfang firmly stated that the suppression will be completed by the end of this month</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou dispatch, 14th] Taihu Suppression Area Commander Fu Jingfang, in view of the fact that the suppression work has already started and the appeasement work is also proceeding smoothly, but bandit traces are still found in Wuxian County from time to time, disturbing the area, according to reliable reports, they are all committed by the bandit troops claiming to be the "New Fourth Army," which should be sanctioned in order to complete the suppression. He specially invited Su County Magistrate Lu Jianhua and Military Section Chief Guo Pingyan to Mudu at 9:00 a.m. on the 13th to discuss countermeasures. It was decided to first improve the Baojia system, so that the bandit troops have nowhere to hide, and then wipe them out in one fell swoop. The reporter met with Mr. Fu at about 2:00 p.m. and asked about the recruitment situation. He said that the Liao Bingnan Department has excellent discipline after being incorporated, and the supplies and equipment are very complete. As for the other two departments, Xie Decheng and Hu Zhiying, Commissioner Jin Jiarang is in the process of contacting them, and they can generally surrender. Yang Yanbin once went to Wangting to recruit scattered bandits in the area, but the effect was minimal. The headquarters believes that the suppression work must be completed by the end of October, so if the bandit troops continue to be stubborn, they will launch a large-scale search and suppression.</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou News] At about 12:00 a.m. on the day before yesterday, two bandit ships carrying more than 20 bandits, holding one machine gun and more than a dozen rifles, suddenly appeared in Hengjing Xu Zhuang Township of this county, intending to land and loot. They were discovered by the local self-defense team, who fired first. Seeing that the shore was prepared, the bandit ships sailed towards Huanglu Township. At that time, the Huanglu Township self-defense team also heard the sound of gunfire and had already prepared. When the bandit ship approached the area, the self-defense team ordered it to approach the shore. Seeing that the shore was also prepared, knowing that there was no way to spy, the bandit ship quickly raised its sails and fled towards West Taihu.</p>
<p>[Our Qingpu News] Since the bandit group of Li Defu fled back to the county on the morning of the 7th of this month after being encircled and suppressed by various counties, its momentum has become even more rampant. It has now been broken up into three groups, with light machine guns, Thompson submachine guns, and other new weapons, disturbing various districts and appearing in broad daylight without any scruples. Considering the importance of politics during the bandit suppression period, the local authorities specially formed a special propaganda team composed of party, government, military, police, and interim council members, divided into two groups in the east and west townships, led by the interim council and the county party department respectively, and set off immediately to publicize government orders, in order to achieve the effect of "three points military, seven points political." The working time for the first departure is stipulated as three weeks.</p>
<p>[Our Dangtu News] The suppression work here has completed the initial stage, and the bandits in the Meili District can be expected to be eliminated. More than 100 people have been captured and surrendered, and are being dealt with separately. A part of the suppression troops has returned to their original defense, and the rest are concentrated and waiting for orders. County Magistrate Pan and others will go to Dongtang City to inspect and direct the suppression.</p>
<h3>Xiangshan, Sanmen, Ninghai: Abundant Harvest, Cheap Rice</h3>
<p>[Our Yuyao News] Xiangshan, Sanmen, and Ninghai counties have had bumper harvests this year. The early rice and autumn harvest are both bountiful. The single-season rice, glutinous rice, and double-season late rice in Xiangshan are particularly outstanding, with yields doubling in previous years. Recently, the price of rice in these areas is only about 30,000 yuan per stone. Because the index of other prices is increasing day by day, the cheap grain hurts farmers, and farmers are calling out in succession.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Chinese Medicine Practitioners Launch Petition: Three Requirements for Examination and Verification</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 14th] The examination and verification of Chinese medicine practitioners, previously stipulated by the central government to be held simultaneously in 14 places across the country on November 1, is of great importance as this examination is to determine the qualifications of doctors. Therefore, the Chinese Medicine Practitioners Association of this county has specially united with neighboring counties and set the joint meeting at 2:00 p.m. on the 18th of this month at the Old School Chinese Medicine Practitioners Training Institute. Invitation letters have been sent to the Chinese Medicine Practitioners Associations of Changshu, Wujiang, Kunshan, and other counties, inviting them to send representatives to attend on time. The focus of the meeting is to discuss the formation of a joint petition group of several counties, to go to Beijing on a regular basis to petition, requesting: (1) Examination and verification should be held separately in each county; (2) The examination and verification standards should be based on the 1943 Physicians Law; (3) Those who have lost their civil affairs licenses should be allowed to be examined and verified in accordance with the law after the board of directors and supervisors of each physicians association prove it.</p>
<h3>Xiaofeng Bamboo Restores Sales</h3>
<p>[Our Xiaofeng News] Xiaofeng County produces more than 100,000 pieces of bamboo per year, which are sold to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and other provinces. It is a major income for the people of Xiaofeng, and their livelihood depends on it for half a year. During the Anti-Japanese War, due to traffic blockages, it was not easy to transport and sell. Recently, the ships have been restored and the routes are smooth. The bamboo merchants of the county presented it to the Second District Special Commissioner's Office and approved the establishment of the Xiaofeng County Forestry and Agricultural Cooperative in Meixi Town, specializing in the promotion and sales of bamboo, which has already opened.</p>
<h3>Youth Army Garrisoned on Two Routes: The 202nd Division Headquarters Moves to Suzhou: Responsible for Collecting and Training Refugee Youths</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 14th] The 202nd Division of the Youth Army recently received an order from the Ministry of National Defense that, in order to facilitate the collection and training of refugee youths in northern Jiangsu, the division headquarters and directly subordinate troops moved from Hangzhou to Suzhou. Chief of Staff Major General Fang Maokai led the troops to arrive and surveyed the former site of the Traffic Police Training Regiment on Xueshi Street as the division headquarters. Mr. Fang met with this newspaper's special correspondent stationed in Suzhou alone on the evening of the 13th and made a statement, elaborating on the mission of the division in great detail, saying: The mission of this division is to garrison in Suzhou under orders, and the tasks are as follows: (1) Collect and train refugee youths from counties and cities along the Beijing-Shanghai railway line, which must be completed by the end of this year. (2) Starting from January next year, be responsible for handling the centralized training of educated youths from Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Taiwan provinces. At this moment, high school or university students among the draft-age men must participate in centralized training according to the provisions of the new conscription law. However, in order to adapt to China's current social education situation and the disparity in cultural standards, the government has specially stipulated that educated youths will be centrally trained by the Youth Division, and ordinary draft-age men will be centrally trained by the Division/Regiment Management Area or ordinary division to avoid the difficulty of uneven procedures in education and training. Mr. Fang continued to say: The two brigades and four regiments under the division will be stationed in important strongholds along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. The deployment will be completed within days. Division Commander Lieutenant General Luo Zewen is currently in Beijing asking the Ministry of National Defense for instructions and will come to Suzhou soon. In addition to the heads of the departments of the division headquarters, there are also Lieutenant Colonel Zhang Zhongqu, staff officer of the Training Department of the Reserve Forces of the Ministry of National Defense, and a technician from the Engineering Department to guide the collection and training and survey the barracks. As for the conscription location for the centralized training of educated youths next year, it will be decided after the Ministry of National Defense designates it.</p>

<h3>Chongqing Labor Association Dispute: Court Hearing Today</h3>

It is learned that the defendant Zhu Xuefan just received the summons yesterday (the 14th), and it is actually difficult to rush to court, so he telegraphed to request permission to entrust the inquiry, and it is learned that Mr. Zhu now intends to petition the Shanghai District Court to transfer the case to the Chongqing District Court for inquiry in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Changshu and Qingpu Rush to Repair Highways</h3>
<p>[Our Changshu News] The county government followed the instructions of Provincial Chairman Wang's inspection in Changshu and rushed to build the bridges and culverts of the coastal highways from this city to Fushan and Twelve Fort Port to meet military needs, expanded and laid telephone lines in various townships to facilitate transportation, and requisitioned workers to dredge the main river. A total of more than 80 million yuan is required, which has been submitted to the province for approval, so that construction can start as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Our Qingpu News] During the bandit suppression period, the rush repair of highway transportation is a top priority. The Suhu Highway passes through a section of this county.

<h3>Rogue Prank: Grand Theater Scare</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou News] The Grand Theater in Beiju, this county, once received a threatening letter some days ago. The matter was reported to the police and other relevant agencies for protection. At about 5:00 p.m. on the 12th, just as the theater was showing the second movie and was about to end, an object emitting light suddenly exploded in the auditorium with a loud noise. The audience panicked and fled, and the order was disrupted. The theater telegraphed various military and police agencies to dispatch a large number of personnel to the scene to suppress the situation. At the same time, the emergency exits were opened to evacuate the audience, and fortunately there were no injuries. After searching, a cigarette butt was found under the tenth row of seats downstairs. There were two burnt match sticks inside the cigarette butt, and there were residual traces of magnesium powder for photography on the outside. It was discovered that the loud noise and white light were caused by this. Therefore, the explosion was loud and there was light, but there was no destructive power, which was obviously a rogue prank. The city defense headquarters and the military police team believe that this action is enough to endanger public safety and must not be tolerated simply because no damage occurred. It was decided to strictly investigate and arrest the perpetrators and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>The Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu is Exhausted and Continues to Send Spies to Disturb Southern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>[Report from our Suzhou correspondent] Recently, the Communist army in Northern Jiangsu, due to repeated military defeats and exhausted resources, in an attempt to reverse the declining trend, dispatched Ye Jingbo, a senior counselor of the Communist Suwan Border Region government, along with more than 200 of his special agents, disguised as refugees and other various personas, to cross the Yangtze River from places such as Jiangdu, sneaking into the vicinity of the Nanjing-Shanghai railway line, with the intention of waiting for an opportunity to sabotage the railway and disrupt public order.

<h3>Jiaxing Collects Land Tax in Kind, Request to Convert to Rice Denied</h3>
<p>[Report from our Jiaxing correspondent] The collection of land tax in kind in this county is about to begin. However, local public opinion organizations and farmers' associations believe that Jiaxing farmers do not store grain, so they telegraphed the Provincial Land and Grain Department, requesting to pay land tax in rice. The Provincial Department forwarded the request to the Ministry of Food for approval. Now, the Ministry has replied, stating that rice is easily spoiled and damaged and cannot be stored for long, so grain must still be paid and conversion to rice is not allowed.</p>

<h3>1.5 Billion Yuan in New Shares to Revive the Changxing Coal Mine, Coal Expected to be Produced Within Seven Months</h3>

<p>Whether Xinzhuang Belongs to Songjiang or Shanghai</p>
<p>We live in Xinzhuang, West Shanghai. Before the provincial and municipal boundary demarcation is resolved, the issue of this year's land tax is of great concern to the residents near our town. The facts are written below: More than a month ago, the Songjiang County Government posted notices everywhere, stating that they wanted to collect land tax, borrow grain, and collect autonomous donations and taxes. The joint office of the 15th and 16th Baos of the 26th District of Shanghai City reported this to the Municipal Government for review. Now, the Bao office announced that it had received instructions from the Municipal Government stating that it had telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government, ordering the Songjiang County Government to withdraw the Xinzhuang office and the police station, and to stop collecting taxes and borrowing grain. However, the Songjiang County Xinzhuang office is currently urging the local landlords to pay. I think that the people are in this position, which party should they obey in order to not violate the law? I would like to ask your newspaper's "Reader's Opinions" column to disclose this, or to bother the provincial and municipal authorities to seek a clear explanation, so as to prevent the people from being confused and not knowing what to do. I would be very grateful. (Zhang Wunong)</p>
<p>Quickly Promulgate Housing Lease Regulations</p>
<p>Since the "Wartime Housing Lease Regulations" were legally abolished six months after the end of the war, the malignant housing shortage caused by the war has become increasingly serious due to the lack of reasonable emergency laws to manage it! The courts invoke the leasing regulations of the Civil Code as a benchmark for resolving current housing shortage disputes, and the judgments made are quite inappropriate in terms of the circumstances and facts faced by tenants under fixed-term contracts. The end of the war does not mean that all the malignant consequences caused by the war have been eliminated. Looking at the fact that the wartime leasing regulations were abolished six months after the war, it can be seen that the legislators at that time estimated that the housing shortage problem could be eliminated six months after the end of the war. Unexpectedly, the external troubles have been eliminated, but the internal worries have not been resolved. More than a year has passed, and the situation has deteriorated. Population concentration and serious housing shortage in major cities has led to constant disputes. Appropriate housing lease management regulations should be formulated to provide a benchmark for court judgments. However, the authorities have no time for this, causing most landlords to be able to legally terminate leases on the pretext of pursuing their desire to be paid in gold bars, which is deeply regrettable!</p>
<p>Looking at other consequences caused by the war, such as inflation, high prices are used to regulate it, education has declined, and efforts are gradually being made to rectify it, and traffic is inconvenient, and orders are given to improve it. Only the serious housing shortage has not seen any effort to alleviate it. Instead, the only leasing regulations targeting this problem have been abolished, and the current Civil Code leasing regulations are used instead, which is like having someone whose height and width have changed dramatically wearing a robe made nine years ago. It is neither elegant nor applicable, is it not a joke!</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the court accepts the landlord's lawsuit to terminate the lease relationship, if it is a fixed-term contract, it will immediately order the tenant to move out within a limited time. Most leases in Shanghai now have a term, and if the term expires, a lawsuit is filed (in fact, most have already expired), and the tenant is ordered to move out after the lawsuit. Regardless of whether the human feelings and facts are reasonable, just the fact that the tenants are being evicted and sleeping on the streets will gradually increase and obstruct traffic. This may be inconvenient for both security and administration. Law is based on customs, human feelings, moral habits, and environmental facts, and it is formed by intersecting and combining them. How can it be independent from the above factors? The judgment of right and wrong is naturally difficult to be reasonable! Therefore, the current Civil Code leasing regulations will not only fail to formulate a solution to the housing shortage but may also cause other unnecessary disputes and consequences.</p>
<p>The Bloody Tears of Christians in Northern Jiangsu</p>
<p>The Christians in Northern Jiangsu are in deep waters, without clothes or food, like beggars, suffering from war disasters, and living a hard life. The relief for national refugees has not reached the Christians in Northern Jiangsu at all. They have no permanent property and no ability to resume business. I hope that fellow believers will be enthusiastic and help each other. (Hong Sheng)</p>

<h3>Many Abstentions in the Referendum, France Passes New Constitution, Promulgating the Three Principles of Government of the People, by the People, for the People</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 14th] The draft of the new French Constitution was voted on by referendum yesterday. The final vote counts are as follows: (1) In mainland France and the North African territories of Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia, 9,143,310 votes were in favor, and 8,084,067 votes were against, with 1,059,243 more votes in favor than against. (2) In mainland France (excluding Corsica), 9,002,467 votes were in favor, and 7,790,676 votes were against, with 7,776,893 abstentions. During the initial constitutional draft vote in May of this year, the total number of votes in favor for the country and its territories was 9,109,771, and the number of votes against was 10,272,586.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 14th] A referendum was held in various parts of Vietnam yesterday to vote on the new French Constitution. According to preliminary reports, more people are against it than for it. In Cochinchina, 90% of voters opposed it, with 552 votes in favor and 2,934 votes against. The same was true in Hanoi, where out of a total of 5,265 voters, only 2,701 voted, with 509 votes in favor and 2,192 votes against.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 13th] The new French Constitution was voted on by the people today. This constitutional draft seeks to establish a government based on the three principles of government of the people, by the people, and for the people, as established by US President Lincoln, and its meaning has been incorporated into the constitution. The dispute between former President De Gaulle and other opposition parties lies only in the details, and the final judgment rests with the people of the whole country, which is the basic principle of democratic politics. According to the outline of the new constitutional draft, the organizations of the various government departments are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) "Executive Branch": There will be a President and a Prime Minister. (2) "Legislative Branch": A parliament will be established, composed of the National Assembly and the Council of the Republic. (3) "Judicial Branch": A Supreme Court and a High Court will be established. (4) "Advisory Council": An Economic Committee and a French Federal Council will be established for consultation.</p>
<p>De Gaulle firmly believes that one of the two houses, namely the National Assembly, retains too much power over the executive and judicial departments. Whether his statement is correct is debatable, but the allocation of these powers is determined by the French Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Popular Republican Movement, which represent 15 million voters in France, which is enough to guarantee that the constitution they have drafted will be accepted by the people. However, De Gaulle's reputation is also enough to compete fiercely with them, so the outcome is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>The preamble to the new constitution states that everyone has inalienable rights, regardless of race, religion, or belief. According to the constitution, everyone has the right to join a trade union and strike. Workers can not only participate in the determination of their working conditions but also participate in the management of enterprises. All wealth and the operation of all industries that have the nature of national public undertakings or monopolistic undertakings must actually be owned by all the people. The preamble guarantees that France will not engage in wars of conquest and agrees, with the consent of various countries in the area, to limit its sovereignty to the extent necessary to maintain and defend peace. The 617 members of the National Assembly are elected by direct election. The Council of the Republic has 250 to 320 representatives, some elected by the National Assembly and some elected by the Electoral College. Only the National Assembly has complete legislative power. The Council of the Republic can draft bills and submit them to the National Assembly for final decision.</p>
<p>De Gaulle's Moral Victory</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 13th] The new French constitutional draft was put to a popular vote today. According to reports from various polling stations here, the number of voters in the morning was very small. Although the weather was clear, by noon, the number of people who went to the polls at some polling stations was only half of the number of voters during the May referendum on the constitutional draft. However, according to various strong indications, 20% of the voters nationwide will abstain from voting. Because Laos and other provinces in Vietnam are located in remote areas with difficult transportation, copies of the new French constitutional draft were dropped by parachute in various districts on the outskirts. According to supporters of De Gaulle, there are many abstentions in this vote, and there must also be many votes against it, which is General De Gaulle's moral victory. De Gaulle believes that the new constitution has failed to establish a workable political system and tends to become an anarchic and dictatorial system, and he has advised the people to reject it. However, the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Popular Republican Movement all support this constitutional draft, and although De Gaulle strongly opposes it, the leaders of the various parties are urging the people to accept it.</p>

<h3>Japanese War Criminals Request Court to Summon Litvinov to Testify</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] During the war crimes trial today, the prosecutor presented documents believed to be from the diary of former Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov. The defendants requested that Litvinov be summoned to testify in Tokyo. The court is considering this matter. According to the diary presented by the Soviet prosecutor, the document reveals that Japan rejected the Soviet Union's attempt to establish a non-aggression pact in 1931.</p>
<h3>Report Says Siam Decides to Return Territory on Vietnamese Border</h3>

<h3>International Women's Conference Opens in New York</h3>
<p>Delegates from 53 Countries Attending</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 14th] The International Women's Conference initiated by Mrs. Roosevelt opened in New York today, with 200 women delegates from 53 countries attending. The conference will spend ten days discussing world political, social, economic, and religious issues. Former enemy countries such as Germany, Italy, and Japan also have representatives participating. Although the Soviet Union was invited, it did not send a delegation. The U.S. representative, Dr. Vera Micheles Dean, Director of Research for the Foreign Policy Association, first presented her views on the conference's first major topic, "The Problem of World Political Organization," calling on women around the world to reject old-fashioned nationalism and eliminate the concept of national sovereignty to build international trust. Mrs. Roosevelt will travel from Hyde Park to attend and speak at the conference on the 20th.</p>
<h3>Summary of Five-Nation Treaties: Europe's Map Sees Only Minor Changes; Prevent Aggression, Establish Democratic Principles</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 14th] Considering the treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland, as proposed by the Paris Peace Conference, the map of Europe will see only minor changes. The four major powers' foreign ministers will draft the final treaties based on these five draft treaties and hand them over to the five former enemy countries for signing. The principles of the five treaties are largely the same, and the main issues addressed are nothing more than preventing future aggression, Europe's economic recovery, and establishing democratic principles and human rights. It is hoped that after the five former enemy countries satisfactorily resolve the various issues of the treaties, they can join the United Nations organization as members. Allied forces will withdraw from each of the former enemy countries within ninety days of the treaties coming into effect. Only the Soviet Union may maintain troops within Hungary and Romania to maintain its communication lines with Austria. The territorial changes this time are very small, with Italy suffering the most losses. The Balkan borders will only see minor adjustments, and will largely revert to their old borders of 1939. Trieste will establish a free zone, formulate a democratic constitution, and have an official stationed by the United Nations Security Council. Regarding</p>
<p>Disarmament</p>
<p>each of the five former enemy countries may only retain a small military force to maintain domestic security and border and air defense. The remaining armaments will be handed over to the Allied forces. Military training, except for authorized individuals, is generally prohibited. Other security measures include the establishment of demilitarized zones in specific areas such as the Greek-Bulgarian border, prohibiting the construction of permanent fortresses capable of firing upon Allied territories. The prohibition of certain weapons includes atomic weapons, self-propelled bombs, long-range artillery, automatic mines, one-man torpedoes, bombers, and (except for the Soviet Union) motor torpedo boats.</p>
<p>Regarding Politics</p>
<p>each treaty has provisions forcing the government to guarantee the democratic rights of the people. Except for Italy, each country clearly stipulates that there must be no fascist or anti-United Nations organizations. Except for Bulgaria, this clause specifically mentions the Soviet Union. War criminals and Allied traitors must be handed over, and the Allied countries will repatriate the prisoners of war of each former enemy country as far as possible.</p>
<p>Economic Clauses</p>
<p>that have been agreed upon include: (1) Granting most-favored-nation treatment to each United Nations country within ten months. Italy must grant most-favored-nation treatment to the United Nations within a period of three years. (2) Respecting the internal sovereignty of each former enemy country, except where the country's economic legislation has state-run monopolies. (3) Restoring the property rights of the Allied countries in the defeated countries and providing compensation for damages. This compensation is paid in local currency to facilitate their economic recovery.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale U.S. Military Exercise in Japan; Various Army, Navy, and Air Force Units Participate; Completion of All Programs to Take Five Days</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] The U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force began their largest exercise since the occupation of Japan today, at a landing site selected before Japan's surrender. High-speed bomber squadrons will conduct bombing exercises against targets on the beach at treetop level, lasting five days. The Navy will conduct a simulated attack in Tokyo Bay. B-61 "Black Widow" night fighters and A-26 attack bombers will create dense smoke screens on the beach. P-51 "Mustang" bombers will destroy enemy bunkers with thousands of pounds of bombs. Paratroopers will also participate in the exercise. Only combat troops will land on the first day of the exercise, and heavy equipment will remain on the ships. Some equipment will land tomorrow, and all equipment will land on the 17th, thus completing the exercise.</p>
<h3>New Japanese Constitution to Be Promulgated on November 3rd</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] The Japanese government has decided to promulgate the new constitution on November 3rd, the birthday of Emperor Meiji. The constitution will take effect six months later.</p>
<h3>Uranium, the Raw Material for Making Atomic Bombs, Sold by the U.S. to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 13th] The New York American, affiliated with Hearst, reported that the United States secretly sold 500 pounds of black uranium oxide, the most precious metal in the world and raw material for making atomic bombs, to the Soviet Union in 1943. At that time, no more than a hundred people knew about the Manhattan Project (which was responsible for making the atomic bomb), and although those involved in the atomic bomb's manufacture protested this sale at the time, the U.S. government still approved it. The Soviet Purchasing Commission handled the purchase for the Soviet Union, claiming that it was for medical research and non-military scientific experiments.</p>
<h3>Philippine President Roxas Refuses to Accept Franco's Medal</h3>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 13th] According to a report from Madrid, the Spanish Franco government intended to award medals to Philippine President Roxas and Vice President and Foreign Minister Quirino. Roxas announced today that he would refuse the award, because the constitution stipulates that foreign medals may not be accepted without the consent of Congress. This Spanish medal is the same as the one awarded to Argentine President Perón.</p>
<h3>Main Base of British Pacific Fleet to Be Established in Australia; Rumor of Seeking a Summer Naval Station in China Is Untrue</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] The Sunday Times reported that its Beijing correspondent telegraphed that naval issues in the Far East were gradually becoming the focus of speculation. Britain does not intend to maintain a large naval base in Hong Kong or Singapore. The main base of the British Pacific Fleet will be established in Australia. Rumors that Britain wants to obtain a summer naval station in China, and that China has asked Britain to send naval instructors to train the Chinese Navy, are all untrue.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] The War Office announced the appointment of Major General Erskin, acting Chief of Staff of the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the British Army of the Rhine, as Commander of the British Army in Hong Kong. The Major General served as head of the British Military Mission in Belgium from 1944 to 1945.</p>
<h3>Japan's Political Parties and Parliament (Part Two)</h3>
<p>When the war situation progressed smoothly, they attempted to take advantage of the spoils of war, and they are still</p>
<p>active behind the scenes</p>
<p>in politics, believing that the current international situation is favorable to them, hoping that relations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union will deteriorate, exaggerating the conflict between the Chinese Nationalists and Communists, and creating an anti-China atmosphere in the House of Peers. When Interior Minister Omura Seiichi answered Yamada Ryozaburo's question regarding the crackdown on Koreans and "compatriots" in the House of Peers on September 9th, he even referred to the Chinese as "people of a third country," rather than people of an Allied country. Only after the local delegation sent a letter correcting this did he declare it to be a misunderstanding. Ikeda Hayato, Director of the Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, also wanted to treat Taiwanese as people of a third country and</p>
<p>not list Taiwanese as Chinese citizens</p>
<p>when answering Matsutani Junnosuke's question regarding the collection of property taxes in the House of Peers on the 9th of this month. According to the regulations of the Allied authorities, citizens of Allied countries have no tax obligations in Japan, but Ikeda of the Tax Bureau actually stated in Parliament that the government was currently discussing the collection of property taxes from Taiwanese. All of these facts illustrate that conservative forces are using these politicians as tools</p>
<p>to attempt a resurgence</p>
<p>. In order to strengthen their camp, a grand union is the inevitable outcome, so recently the calls for a unified front of conservative forces have been deafening. According to various newspapers, Yoshida recently personally discussed the merger of the two parties with Shidehara, the president of the Progressive Party, believing that there should only be two political parties, radical and conservative, to promote</p>
<p>the realization of democracy in Japan</p>
<p>, and he expressed this view to a United Press reporter. At the same time, Kajii Karo (an important figure in Kodama Yoshio's organization, a former enemy intelligence agency in Shanghai) of the Liberal Party and Kawai Kosae of the Progressive Party held secret talks on the merger issue. It is said that Yoshida will be the leader of the new party after the merger, and Shidehara and Saito Takao will serve as top advisors. Although the opinions within the two parties are not yet fully unified, the merger is only a matter of formality, and they have already</p>
<p>formed a united front</p>
<p>in practice. In the local elections to be held in mid-October, the Liberal and Progressive parties have even decided to cooperate with each other to expand the power of the conservative faction. The Liberal Party is also willing to provide practical assistance to the Progressive Party's local election candidates. This illustrates that the two parties have actually</p>
<p>implemented a grand union</p>
<p>. The Socialist Party was formed in November of last year by social movement pioneers such as Iso Abe, Toyohiko Kagawa, and Takano Iwasaburo, the top leaders of pre-war labor and peasant associations, and is the largest opposition party in Parliament. Their highest ideal is to achieve socialism through Parliament, advocating for social democracy within the framework of maintaining the Emperor system. This view is very clearly expressed in the</p>
<p>draft constitutional amendment</p>
<p>submitted by the Socialist Party to Parliament. After this Second National Congress, the Socialist Party's focus on parliamentarianism became even more pronounced. The party's policy was originally to use the General Federation of Labor as its activity center, leading mass movements to expand the party's power; however, because the party is the largest opposition party in Parliament, this part of its power had to be devoted to parliamentary activities, and recently the</p>
<p>leadership of the labor movement center</p>
<p>has fallen into the hands of the Communist Party, and the Socialist Party has been in a passive position in many cases. Therefore, it has adopted a bystander attitude towards the recent seamen's strike, the national railway workers' strike, and the news and broadcasting industry strike. The composition of the Socialist Party is also very complex. Among the Socialist Party members elected in the general parliamentary election, more than 20 were chairmen of various companies, and at the same time there were People's Front factions advocating cooperation with the Communist Party, and anti-communist elements who declared cooperation with the Liberal Party. As a result of the election at this National Congress,</p>
<p>the right-wing forces won</p>
<p>, with Suehiro Nishio, whose activity base is the General Federation of Labor, being elected as Secretary-General, and Tetsu Katayama being promoted to Chairman of the Central Executive Committee. At this congress, Tatsuki Morito, a neutral faction member, explained the reason why the Socialist Party declared its refusal to participate in the Communist-led National Salvation Front, which aroused dissatisfaction among left-wing members, and</p>
<p>a fierce quarrel</p>
<p>broke out between the left and right factions in the field. Ozawa Hisaaki, a representative from Aomori Prefecture, questioned the right wing, saying that if they wanted to form a democratic front, they must cooperate with the Communist Party. At this congress, the Socialist Party took a generally negative stance on the current labor movement. Mizutani Chosaburo, the chairman of the congress, answered the question of Otsuka Eigoro, a right-wing representative, saying that it was doubtful whether the current labor union leaders understood the spirit of labor unions, that it was time to reflect on this, and that it was very simple to submit a</p>
<p>motion of no confidence in the Yoshida cabinet</p>
<p>to Parliament; but that overthrowing the Yoshida cabinet was not a simple matter. At this congress, the Communist Party sent Nosaka Sanzo as a representative to lobby for cooperation with the Socialist Party to form a People's Front, but to no avail. At the same time, the Socialist Party headquarters ordered its local branches to stop cooperating with the Communist Party, which shows that the Socialist Party is gradually becoming a government party. Yoshida also revealed the idea of a merger of the Liberal, Progressive, and Socialist parties, and there is also an intention within the Socialist Party to form a coalition cabinet with Yoshida. At this</p>
<p>National Congress</p>
<p>the party's cadres were constantly criticized from all sides, and there was great dissatisfaction with the failure to realize the democratic front, and there was doubt as to whether the party's cadres still had the sincerity to realize the socialism that the party had proclaimed. Some members, such as Kato Kanjuro, Kimori Saburo, Arayan Hanmon, and Takatsu Tadashi, are said to be splitting off. At the same time, economic groups representing conservative economic forces, echoing this political offensive, have successively announced their establishment, such as the Kanto Management Association, the Keizai Doyukai, and the New Industrialists League, all of which have been formally established. Although Kosa Yuzo, Furuetsu Kiyoshi, Tatsuyama Aiichiro, Matsumoto Taro, and Shimada Katsunosuke have retreated from the surface of the economic world due to the purge order, they still have a lingering connection. How the mainstream of these conservative forces will develop is something that we need to pay attention to and monitor.</p>

<h3>Councillor Accusations of Treason; High Court Says No Complaint Received; Xiao Kuai Le Troupe Should Not Insult Lu Keming in Radio Broadcast; Speaker Pan Issues Important Statement Yesterday</h3>
<p>For days, the Xiao Kuai Le Troupe has been broadcasting insults against Senator Lu Keming on the Shengli and Yuandong radio stations. Speaker Pan spoke to reporters about this yesterday, stating that there was indeed a proposal in the Senate to suggest that the government should review radio programs, but it was not proposed by Senator Lu, and it had nothing to do with the Xiao Kuai Le Troupe. Furthermore, senators are legally not responsible to the outside world for speeches made in the assembly, and the troupe cannot casually rely on rumors reported in the newspapers to launch attacks. If Senator Lu believes that the troupe's actions are a public insult and damage his reputation, he can file a complaint according to law. As for radio broadcasts, there are original regulatory agencies, and those who issue licenses for program content should be responsible for paying attention to the review. If there are violations of the law, they can be banned according to law. Broadcasting troupes belong to entertainers, and they must also have their professional organizations, and the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs is the supervisory authority. If there are inappropriate actions, the supervisory authorities will not sit idly by, he said.</p>
<p>Regarding the recent issue of some municipal senators being accused of treason, Pan Gongzhan expressed his opinion in his capacity as speaker, stating that accusations of treason are based on actions rather than positions. The qualifications of the current municipal senators have all been reviewed and approved by the Public Officials Candidate Qualification Review Committee. If it is deemed inappropriate, the committee should be responsible, which has nothing to do with the Municipal Senate. At the same time, the administrative and judicial authorities should have a unified point of view and interpretation regarding the accusation of treason. The issue only involves the personal problem of surrendering to the enemy, so attacking the Municipal Senate is inappropriate. The Chief Prosecutor of the High Court responsibly stated that as of now, the court has not received any complaints from the public accusing municipal senators of treason.</p>
<h3>Municipal Senate's Finance and Self-Government Committees Hold Second Meetings Respectively; Factory Confiscated by Enemy and Puppet Regimes Petitions for Return to Original Owner; Request Banks to Offer Low-Interest Loans to Suppress Daily Commodity Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Finance Committee, the second group of the Municipal Senate, held its second subcommittee meeting at the Bank of Communications yesterday afternoon to discuss eight proposals: (1) Regarding the cotton cloth and factories forcibly purchased during the enemy and puppet regime periods, request the municipal government to forward a letter to the central government, ordering the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui areas to return the remaining cotton cloth to the original owners, and allow the original owners to redeem the factories sold under duress at the original selling price, according to the price index, to relieve the people's hardships. It was resolved to pass it according to the original method, that is, the committee will detail the reasons and request the municipal government to forward a letter to the central government, ordering the Bureau to return the remaining cotton cloth to the original owners in proportion to the purchase vouchers, and allowing the original owners to redeem the factories sold under duress by calculating the amount obtained at the original selling price according to the current price index and preparing the funds. (2) Request the Shanghai Municipal Bank to offer low-interest loans to suppress daily commodity prices and ensure the safety of the lives of the majority of the people. It was resolved to pass it in principle, requesting the municipal government to notify the Shanghai Municipal Bank to consider handling it, and requesting the Bankers Association to handle it together.</p>
<h3>Sell Enemy and Puppet Property to Compensate for People's Losses</h3>
<p>(3) Suggest that the government should use the proceeds from the sale of enemy and puppet property confiscated in Shanghai to compensate the people of this city who suffered losses in the January 28th and August 13th incidents in advance. It was resolved to request the government to promptly compensate for the losses that the people of this city have already registered as a priority. (4) Regarding the request of the Shanghai Soap and Candle Industry Association to request exemption from the commodity tax on soap, it was resolved to notify the person in charge of the association to attend and explain at the next meeting of the group before further discussion.</p>
<h3>Ham and Cured Meat Request Tax Exemption</h3>
<p>(5) The Shanghai Ham Commercial and Cured Meat Commercial Associations requested the abolition of the ham and cured meat tax. As the case has already been resolved by the general assembly to be exempted, the committee decided to request the municipal government to act accordingly. (6) The Shanghai Film and Theater Industry Association submitted a case for the excessively high entertainment tax rate, providing additional reasons for requesting a reduction in the tax rate. The committee believed that the original application was not without reason, but the group had no right to change the decision of the general assembly, and requested that it be submitted to the next general assembly for discussion.</p>
<h3>Allocate Funds to Acquire the Racecourse</h3>
<p>(7) Request the municipal government to forward a letter to the central government, allocating a portion of the funds obtained from the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau's bidding and sale of enemy and puppet materials as funds for the acquisition of the racecourse. (8) Request the municipal government to allocate public funds to each district so that each district can follow the laws to implement production. It was resolved to reserve both cases for discussion at the next meeting.</p>
<p>In addition, there was a temporary motion, which was passed, stating that in the future, applicants should attend and report on all application cases.</p>
<h3>Various District Offices Request Allocation of Housing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Self-Government Committee, the first group of the Municipal Senate, held its second subcommittee meeting at the Municipal Senate in Fuming Village yesterday afternoon, proposing to request the municipal government to allocate office housing for self-government agencies to facilitate the implementation of self-government. Five articles were passed. Secretary-General Xiang Changquan also reported on the housing conditions of various district offices. Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, supplemented the difficulties, hoping that the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau would allocate housing for lease by the district offices with funds. Mayor Wu attended the meeting and stated that he himself would inspect the locations of the district offices starting in November and then decide on a reasonable solution. However, he hoped that each district office could earnestly achieve two points, namely (1) thoroughly complete the household registration work, and (2) maintain the cleanliness and tidiness of each district.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Police Affairs Committee, the sixth group of the Municipal Senate, is scheduled to hold its second committee meeting at the Municipal Senate at 3:00 PM today. During the meeting, Police Chief Xuan Tiewu will report on smoking ban matters.</p>
<h3>City Government to Reduce Staff and Simplify Administration; Mayor States Completion Possible Within the Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] At yesterday's meeting of the Municipal Council's Autonomy Committee, Mayor Wu stated in response to the committee's proposal to request the city government to reduce staff and simplify administration, while also establishing welfare programs for current employees to increase administrative efficiency, that he had decided to fully implement the plan by the end of this month, adhering to the councilors' resolution to reduce staff by 15 percent. He also stated that since taking office, he had already reduced staff by 500 people. Councilors present also requested the mayor to consider reducing the number of puppet officials in the city government. The following is a statistical table of the number of simplified, recommended, and appointed staff in the Shanghai Municipal Government's various departments and bureaus, based on the draft organizational regulations of the Shanghai Municipal Government:</p>

<h3>Regarding the Issue of Denunciation; Alternate Councilors Hold Differing Views; Dissatisfaction Expressed with a Few Individuals Falsely Using the Name; Mutual Attacks Erupted at the Press Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The recent rumors in the city about the denunciation of two traitorous councilors have attracted much attention from various sectors. To clarify its position and views on this matter, the Shanghai Alternate Councilors Association specially hosted a press conference at the New Life Club at 2:00 PM yesterday. Five people attended, including Wei Yunong, Yang Zhiqian, Yin Yong, Xie Dahuang, and Wang Zhiben, who are standing directors of the association, as well as alternate councilors Cao Yaxia, Wu Renxun, Huang Xiaowen, and more than 30 reporters from various newspapers in the city. Wei Yunong served as chairman and explained that the association was established in September, electing 15 directors and 5 standing directors. The board of directors established two groups: General Affairs and Research. The General Affairs Group established three sections: Documentation, Accounting, and General Services. The Research Group established three sections: Investigation, Design, and Editing. In addition, ten research committees were established for Civil Affairs, Finance, Police Affairs, Economy, Transportation, Education, Welfare, Health, Land, and Regulations. The central task is to promote emotional connection among alternate councilors, jointly research municipal facilities, exchange opinions, and provide suggestions to the authorities for improvement, in order to achieve the goal of seeking welfare for the people. Therefore, its nature is absolutely cooperative with the elected councilors, and it is definitely not confrontational.</p>
<p>Four Points of Opinion Reported</p>
<p>Subsequently, Cao Yaxia reported the association's four points of opinion: (1) According to Article 3 of the "Measures for Restricting the Candidacy and Appointment of Personnel Who Served in Puppet Organizations or Their Subordinate Agencies and Institutions" promulgated by the Legislative Yuan, "Those who have served in puppet organizations or their subordinate agencies and institutions and have not been convicted under the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors shall not be candidates for public office within two years." Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities will conduct self-inspection and make legal adjustments. (2) Personnel serving in public education institutions shall not be elected as councilors, and principals of municipal primary and secondary schools shall also not be councilors. (3) It is solemnly declared that the members of this association absolutely do not want to replace councilors by engaging in anti-traitor work. If any councilors are involved in collaboration with the enemy, they will be subject to legal sanctions. This association is only representing public opinion to promote this work.</p>
<p>Denunciation Triggers Verbal Sparring</p>
<p>Regarding the denunciation of traitorous councilors, Yang Zhiqian also explained that not only has the association not taken such action, but it also has no such motive. If anyone uses the association's name to denounce, we are absolutely opposed to it.</p>
<p>Standing Director Wang Zhiben expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the use of the association's name to denounce traitorous councilors, and stood up to declare: There are 181 alternate councilors, and the opinions of one or two people cannot represent the entire body. Denouncing traitors is something every citizen can do. It is reported that a committee for eliminating traitors has been established, and it is said that Wei Yunong is the person in charge. On this point, I express doubt.</p>
<p>Wei Yunong immediately stated that the title "person in charge" was not self-proclaimed, but was reported in the newspaper. There is nothing to show off about in this matter, and someone "couldn't stand it" and said this. The opinions of the two sides clashed. Wang Zhiben believed that there was no so-called "couldn't stand it" at all. Since it is not a matter of showing off, why come forward in the name of a few people to claim to represent the public's opinion? I am also a standing director, and I still know nothing about everything. Denouncing traitors is obviously a few people acting alone. According to Wang, the association's address was originally at 270 Weihaiwei Road, but later other directors suddenly moved the address without my knowledge, which is really mysterious.</p>
<p>Later, Yang Zhiqian stated that the opinions of the standing directors are actually the same as Wang's, the purpose is to deny that the association has taken such action. It is hoped that all sectors will not misunderstand. The reception ended here, and the point that horse racing has gambling behavior and should be refused to be opened was not even explained.</p>
<p>Oath Supervisor Wu Jingheng, Committee Chairman Fang, and the Entire Committee Members and Guests Take a Group Photo (Taken by Our Newspaper)</p>
<h3>New Chairman and Committee Members of the Municipal Party Department Held Swearing-In Ceremony Yesterday; Central Committee Member Wu Jingheng Supervised the Solemn Ceremony</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Celebration Week and the swearing-in ceremony of the newly appointed Chairman of the Municipal Party Department, Fang Zhi, and Committee Member and Secretary-General Xie Renzhao, Director of the Secretariat Xu Guanya, Director of the Organization and Training Department Chen Baotai, Director of the Propaganda Department Tao Baichuan, Committee Members Wu Kaixian, Shen Chunhui, Qian Jianqiu, Xie Dahuang, Zhou Feicheng, Chen Baohua, etc., were held in conjunction at the Municipal Gymnasium on Shaanxi Road yesterday morning. The layout of the venue was quite solemn. The Central Film Photography Studio also sent staff to the scene to take newsreel footage. At 9:00 AM, the oath supervisor, Central Committee Member Wu Jingheng, Mayor Wu Guozhi, Speaker Pan Gongzhan, and guests from all walks of life, Du Yuesheng, Cheng Cangbo, Xu Jiyu, Xi Yushu, Li Ximou, Hu Xiyuan, etc., totaling more than 500 people, arrived at the meeting one after another. The ceremony began at 9:30 AM, and after performing the rituals as required, Chairman Fang led the oath.</p>
<p>Wu Jingheng's Speech: Promote Democracy</p>
<p>After the oath, Oath Supervisor Wu Jingheng delivered a speech, stating: "Shanghai has now become the center of Eastern politics. Everyone attaches great importance to all criticisms of New York, the center of Western politics. Shanghai in the future is also worthy of attention. We must not regard Shanghai as a 'ten-mile foreign concession' city again. Speaking of politics, the most fashionable term is 'democracy'. Our Kuomintang was established to fight for democracy, and we have never abandoned democracy. Now some people want to urge us to be democratic, thinking that we are not enthusiastic about democracy. This is a big mistake. Therefore, we hope that in Shanghai, the center of politics, starting from the Party Department, we can promote the spirit of democracy. During the War of Resistance, Chairman Fang presided over Party affairs in Chongqing, the center of politics, and achieved great results. This time he came to Shanghai, he is familiar with the job and will definitely make even greater achievements. All committee members are also important figures in the Party, and they will definitely be able to work with Chairman Fang to complete this great mission."</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's Speech: Three Hopes</p>
<p>Guests then delivered speeches: Mayor Wu first delivered a speech, stating: "Today, I am attending the swearing-in ceremony of Chairman Fang and all committee members. I would like to specially put forward three hopes for each of our party members: (1) We must have the spirit of sacrificing our lives for righteousness and enduring hardship and sacrifice. (2) We must have the enthusiasm to do what is right and serve others. (3) We must have the sentiment of rather others betraying me than I betray others. With these three conditions, I think there is not a single compatriot in the country who does not love our Party. In the future, under the leadership of Chairman Fang and all committee members, the Party affairs of Shanghai will definitely be able to promote the spirit of the Kuomintang and complete the task of our Party."</p>
<p>Speaker Pan's Words: A New Style</p>
<p>Speaker Pan then delivered a speech, saying, "It is hoped that the Party in Shanghai will have a new style in the future. Not only Kuomintang members should strive for the Three Principles of the People, but also mobilize the citizens of the entire city to be willing to strive for the Three Principles of the People. The Shanghai Municipal Party Department should regard all citizens of the city as loyal comrades of the Three Principles of the People, in order to build a country of the Three Principles of the People, and a Shanghai of the Three Principles of the People." Subsequently, Councilor Wang Xiaolai delivered a speech, hoping that "the Party and government are integrated" and that the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Party, will realize the Three Principles of the People and achieve the ideal of universal harmony.</p>
<p>Fang Zhi's Reply: Implement the Revolution</p>
<p>Subsequently, Chairman Fang, on behalf of the oath takers, delivered a reply, stating, "I would like to put forward a few hopes for the future: (1) Comply with central laws and central resolutions, be practical and realistic, work hard, and never perfunctorily, follow old customs, exaggerate, or deceive. (2) The Party and government are integrated, and the government and the Party should maintain close contact with each other. We should cooperate with public opinion organs to jointly assist Mayor Wu in promoting government orders and building a greater Shanghai. Currently, the most important things are to suppress prices, support industry and commerce, and provide relief to the unemployed. (3) The era of 'government is not about talking too much' has passed. Under democratic politics, political parties should try their best to express their own policies and decisions, and the citizens of the whole city should also actively build and criticize. Words are not about quantity, but about telling the truth. (4) Consolidate unity, ensure peace, especially the National Assembly, which will be convened soon according to the central law. The constitution related to the long-term stability and security of the country for a hundred years will be formulated. It is hoped that all parties and social leaders will unite and work together to seek national affairs." Finally, the Party members' code of conduct was read aloud, slogans were shouted, and the music was played at 10:30 AM to complete the ceremony.</p>

<h3>National Products Exhibition Hall Grand Opening Today; Covers an Area of Ten Mu and Has 200 Rooms</h3>

<h3>The Meaning of the Words "Subordinate Organizations" in the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors; The Chamber of Commerce Sends a Telegram Requesting Explanation Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce urgently needs to issue an order to clarify the meaning of the words "subordinate organizations" in Article 10 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, in order to correct misunderstandings and reassure people. Yesterday, it sent separate telegrams to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Organization, and the Shanghai Municipal Government to appeal. The original telegram is excerpted as follows: "Your association, in May of this year, requested a supplementary explanation of the meaning of the words 'subordinate organizations' in Article 15 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, that those who do not hold positions in special organizations established by puppet organizations shall not be regarded as 'subordinate organizations' and shall not be subject to the restriction that they cannot be candidates for public office within a certain period of time. In lieu of a telegram, it was submitted to the Ministry of Organization and the Ministry of Social Affairs for review. Later, Luo Qinghua, the elected director of your association, went to the capital on official business and visited the central authorities in detail, handing over the telegram in person and stating that during the period of occupation, there were Baojia organizations everywhere, with ten households forming a Jia. Anyone in the neighborhoods with a little wealth was designated as Jia head, Bao head, or Lianbao head. At that time, residents could not escape the tiger's den. Those who went to the interior could only take on a false name and suffer unexpected disasters. Because the organization was widespread, the scope involved by the enemy was even wider. If it is handled in accordance with Article 15 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, and their civil rights are suspended within a certain number of years, then one out of ten households will be affected. Those who can handle public affairs for the local area will be almost wiped out in one fell swoop. Within a certain period of time, there will be no one to drive and use. The relationship is really too great. It is proposed to lift the restrictions and start anew with the people. Those who held Baojia positions during the period of occupation and did not engage in behaviors that pleased the enemy and harmed the people, and who are still elected when promoting local autonomy, should be handled in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 10 of the Regulations for Handling Traitor Cases, and be exempted from the restrictions of Article 15 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. It is submitted for review and handling. Later, on August 9, your association received Telegram No. 7054 from the Ministry of Organization, stating: 'Regarding the case previously submitted requesting a supplementary explanation of the doubts in Article 15 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, it has been referred to the Ministry of Political Affairs for review, and it has been replied that the request of the Chamber of Commerce is obviously different from the interpretation of the Executive Yuan. For the sake of prudence, it has been recorded and submitted to the Executive Yuan and the Judicial Yuan for unified interpretation, which can be implemented nationwide, so as to form a final decision and dispel doubts.' etc. Special telegram notification etc. So far, the unified interpretation of the Executive Yuan and the Judicial Yuan has not been officially issued, and the 'Measures for Restricting the Candidacy and Appointment of Personnel Who Served in Puppet Organizations or Their Subordinate Agencies and Institutions' promulgated by the Executive Yuan and the Examination Yuan on August 9, 1935, stipulate that these measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation, and their scope of application should be limited to personnel who served in 'puppet organizations or their subordinate agencies'. The meaning of the legal text is very clear and cannot be confused. It is already unnecessary to explain. However, some people still distort the legal text and want to confuse the words 'subordinate' with the people's organizations within the 'enemy-puppet controlled area', with the intention of fabricating charges and hoping to achieve personal gains. Newspaper reports are indiscriminate and confusing, which is enough to confuse the audience and disturb people's minds. According to Article 2, Paragraph 10 of the Regulations for Handling Traitor Cases: 'Personnel of cultural, financial, industrial, freelance, autonomous, or social organizations within the enemy-puppet controlled area who rely on enemy-puppet forces to infringe upon others, upon accusation or report', the provisions of this article are applicable. It is found that trade associations and chambers of commerce are the financial or industrial organizations referred to in this article, and Baojia organizations at all levels are the autonomous organizations referred to in this article. Their incumbents must have the crimes mentioned in the latter part of this article and be accused or reported before they can be strictly investigated. The organizations within the 'controlled area' are very different in severity from the 'subordinate' agencies or organizations mentioned in other articles of the same regulations. The restriction measures promulgated by the Executive Yuan and the Examination Yuan on August 9 also clearly stipulate 'subordinate' organizations, so trade associations and Baojia personnel within the enemy-puppet controlled area should not be subject to the restrictions of these measures. Please promptly give a clear order to explain, in order to correct misunderstandings and reassure people."</p>
<h3>A Blood Debt Owed by the Enemy in Eight Years; Investigation, Registration, and Statistics of Crimes; From November of Last Year to April of This Year; The Total Number Has Reached More Than 30,000 Cases</h3>
<p>[Special Article from Our Newspaper] This is a blood debt! It is owed by the enemy during the eight years of invasion, and has not yet been paid off. It is unknown how this blood debt will be settled in the future?</p>
<p>Please take a look at the statistics of the investigation and registration of enemy crimes by the Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate from November of last year to April of this year:</p>
<p>November of the 34th Year 1,297 cases</p>
<p>December 11,919 cases</p>
<p>January of the 33rd Year 10,160 cases</p>
<p>February 6,609 cases</p>
<p>March 422 cases</p>
<p>April 231 cases</p>
<p>Total 30,638 cases</p>
<p>The word "enemy" here includes enemy military police, enemy troops, and enemy expatriates. Among the 30,638 crimes, only 488 cases, less than 1.6% of the total, have victims who can point out the name of the perpetrator and the unit to which they belonged. The classification of the crimes is as follows:</p>
<p>Murder and Massacre 71 cases</p>
<p>Torture of Civilians 98 cases</p>
<p>Rape 3 cases</p>
<p>Detention of People and Inhumane Treatment 58 cases</p>
<p>During Military Occupation There Were Acts of Seizing Sovereignty 2 cases</p>
<p>Robbery 15 cases</p>
<p>Confiscation of Property 120 cases</p>
<p>Extortion of Illegal and Excessive Donations and Levies 2 cases</p>
<p>Wanton Destruction of Property 119 cases</p>
<p>Total 488 cases</p>
<p>Let us close our eyes and think about how many tragic stories are contained in the number 30,638? And in these many lives, many piles of blood and tears, there are also many inexhaustible and inspiring, commendable and tearful historical materials! Could it be that we, as great citizens, will lightly erase this page of blood debts?</p>
<p>When the Ministry of Judicial Administration ordered the Local Procuratorate to conduct this investigation and registration of enemy crimes after the victory, those kind compatriots who came from the countryside, bringing their old and young, tearfully recounted how their homes and relatives were cruelly burned and killed by the enemy, and tears kept flowing from their eyes. Now it is time to pay off the debt. They have only one wish: to punish those murderers. Although many illiterate and kind villagers mostly cannot name the perpetrators and their units, they are very sincere in their spirit of not being afraid of trouble and coming from afar to register when they hear that there is a place to appeal. They believe that murderers will eventually receive their due reward.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, we should review how the work of trying Japanese war criminals has progressed in the past year. How many have been punished nationwide so far? Compare it with the number of enemy crime investigations and registrations! What fraction does it account for?</p>
<p>"30,638", this number stained with blood and tears! However, we must recognize that this is only a part of the enemy's crimes near Shanghai? Those who sacrificed silently and were unknown, those who did not register, the enemy's crimes across the country that are millions of times greater than the corner near Shanghai - millions of times "30,638", how will they be avenged? This question, the compatriots who died under the enemy's crimes, are waiting for us, the living, to give an answer!</p>
<p>Inexhaustible stories stained with blood and tears, this is a blood debt! It is owed by the enemy during the eight years of invasion, and has not yet been paid off. It is unknown how this blood debt will be settled in the future!</p>

<h3>Panda Flies from Chengdu to Shanghai Today; Recovering from a Minor Illness; Arriving Late; After a Short Rest, Will Cross the Sea to the United States; US Military Officer Acts as a Flower Protector</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Another panda Miss has already taken off from Chengdu yesterday, spent the night in Chongqing, and will arrive in Shanghai this afternoon.</p>
<p>Miss was born in Western Sichuan, and her name has not yet been determined. The mission of her trip is to cross the ocean and go to the New York Zoo to fill the position of the previous Miss who died there three years ago.</p>
<p>Panda Miss recently suffered from a minor illness, so she missed a flight, which made the people taking care of her busy. Fortunately, Miss recovered soon, and the staff on the China Airlines flight arranged everything comfortably for her on this trip to Shanghai.</p>
<p>She will soon cross the Pacific Ocean by presidential ship. It was originally scheduled for a United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) staff member to accompany her, but he valued work more than "beauty" and could not spare the time. Now, a US military officer has voluntarily volunteered to be a "flower protector" and be her companion along the way.</p>
<p>The first panda Miss to go abroad was taken to the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago by an American explorer in 1938, which made people all over the world crazy about her. Since then, six more Misses have gone abroad one after another, two to the United States and four to the United Kingdom. The one going abroad now is the eighth Miss.</p>
<h3>Puppet Municipal Government Advisor Miyashita Manjiro Arrested; Procured Military Rice and Collected Materials for the Japanese Army; Disguised and Lurked in Hongkou after the Victory, Planning to Escape</h3>
<p>Miyashita Manjiro, a senior economic advisor to the puppet municipal government, was arrested a few days ago at his residence at No. 163 Ruikangli, Hongkou, by a certain military agency. Miyashita Manjiro is from Hokkaido, Japan, and is 57 years old. He came to Shanghai to do business before the war, opening the Rongtai Foreign Firm. When the War of Resistance against Japan broke out and the Japanese army occupied Shanghai, because he was familiar with the highest authorities of the enemy navy and army, he contracted military rice and specialized in enemy military uniforms. He also opened the Datong Transportation Company to transport goods for customers. Later, he became a senior economic advisor to the puppet municipal government. The policy of controlling cotton cloth and cotton yarn promulgated by the puppet government in the 32nd year was the plot of this criminal. The puppet municipal government's iron and copper donation movement was also a masterpiece of this criminal. Taking advantage of his position, he indiscriminately recruited disciples. Many shameless merchants coveted his power or heavy profits and joined his ranks. Each person paid a "seeing gift" of 2 million yuan. As a result, the criminal made a fortune and bought many properties in Shanghai. After the victory, he lurked in Hongkou, disguised as a small businessman, trying to avoid attention, but was eventually discovered and arrested by a certain military agency.</p>

<h3>Embezzlement of Sealed Materials Uncovered on Fuxing Island: Armed Escort Guard Company Commander Arrested and Confesses; Large Amounts of Stolen Goods Recovered from Hardware Stores on Beijing Road and Elsewhere</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Fuxing Island warehouse in Yangshupu, Shanghai, experienced continuous thefts of sealed hardware materials in the middle of last month. The relevant authorities sent personnel to investigate, but no clues were found. After the victory, the island was guarded by the navy with strict security. Petty theft was practically impossible, indicating internal involvement. Therefore, the 常局(local authorities) approached the matter from the side. On the 28th of last month, they discovered that Xietai Chang Hardware Store at No. 8 Defeng Lane, Beijing Road, was selling this hardware material. They arrested the store owner, Chen Zhenchang (33 years old, from Shaoxing). After interrogation, Chen confessed that the 550 dozen hinges (seven boxes in total) were introduced by Ge Jie (from Anhui, living at No. 848 Hualong Road) and purchased from Xi Naichun (at No. 73 Gujia Lane, Beijing Road) for 2.25 million yuan. Based on this confession, the authorities went to the addresses and arrested Xi and Ge. According to Xi's confession, three or four days ago, Ge Jie and another man, Zhang Xinmin (from Henan, living at No. 3 Dean Lane, Fangbang Road, Nanshi), introduced him to Sha Zhenhua, the company commander of the 8th Company of the Fuxing Island Naval Guard Battalion. Sha claimed to have a large number of private hardware goods, cheap and of good quality. If Xi wanted to buy them, Sha would be responsible for delivery. Tempted by the prospect of high profits, Xi agreed. The next day, Sha sent two armed navy soldiers to escort 21 boxes of hardware hinges to his residence in two horse-drawn carts, asking for 8 million yuan. However, after Xi inspected the boxes, he discovered that they did not all contain hinges. Therefore, he only accepted eight boxes of hinges at the time, paying 3.49 million yuan. He later sold 550 dozen to Xietai Chang for 2.25 million yuan. As a result, he not only failed to profit but lost over 1 million yuan. At this point, the truth of the case became clear. The authorities arrested the main culprit of the inside job, Sha Zhenhua, at the Fuxing Island Naval Guard Company headquarters. After interrogation, Sha admitted to the theft. The remaining hardware materials returned by Xi, including eight boxes of copper locks and five boxes of zippers, were stored at Yin Linsheng's residence (from Xuzhou) at No. 178 Dazhong Lane, Zhongzheng Middle Road. The authorities have already retrieved these items. The zippers had been repackaged into two sacks. In addition, it was discovered that the perpetrator had previously stolen and sold a 10-horsepower motor and water pump before this incident, which Ge Jie resold to a man named "A Qi" for 700,000 yuan. The investigation is ongoing. The main culprit, Sha Zhenhua, is an active-duty naval officer and has been handed over to the Naval Military Law Office for punishment according to the law. The remaining suspects have been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Representatives Petition in Nanjing Last Night: Requesting Revocation or Postponement of Elimination</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Shanghai Rickshaw Commercial Guild's petition group traveled to Nanjing by night train last night to petition the highest authorities to revoke the order to abolish rickshaws. The petition group consisted of nine directors and supervisors of the guild: Chen Zhiyao, Bai Zhenggang, Wang Kun, Zhang Baolin, Ge Jinbiao, Deng XieSan, Xu Baokun, Yu Lianjin, Qiu Jiran, as well as Secretary Ji Jimin and staff member Ge Jiandong. Xu Baokun, Qiu Jiran, and Ge Jiandong had traveled to Nanjing the night before to make arrangements. The purpose of the petition group is primarily to have the order revoked. If that is not possible, they request that the elimination be carried out within the period of 1950 to 1953, in accordance with the decision of the Municipal Council. Finally, they hope that the rickshaw licenses to be eliminated can be changed to tricycle licenses. The group's itinerary in Nanjing is as follows: 15th morning, visit the Nanjing Rickshaw Guild; afternoon, entertain representatives from all sectors in the capital. 16th morning, go to the National Government and the Executive Yuan; afternoon, go to the Central Party Headquarters and the Supreme National Defense Commission. 17th morning, go to the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of National Defense; afternoon, go to the Senate.</p>

<h3>Director Wu Convenes Meeting: Rickshaw Elimination Inevitable</h3>
<p>Regarding the elimination of rickshaws in this city, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau convened more than ten directors of the Rickshaw Guild, including Chen Zhiyao, to the bureau for discussions at 4:00 PM yesterday.

Mayor Wu and Director Wu have thoroughly discussed the implementation and follow-up issues to ensure that they are practical. As for the request to delay the elimination and convert the rickshaws into tricycles, that is impossible. The preliminary measures for eliminating rickshaws have been decided: (1) The lottery method has been abolished and replaced with an equal allocation method. (2) Rickshaws owned by a single person who pulls his own rickshaw will be eliminated last. Underage rickshaw pullers will be eliminated first. Whether rickshaw owners with fewer than ten rickshaws will also be subject to allocation for elimination has not yet been decided. Representatives of the rickshaw owners then presented their opinions, and the meeting adjourned around 5:00 PM.</p>

<h3>US Military Tribunal Continues Trial of Nazi War Criminals: Japanese Military Intelligence Chief Testifies</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Twenty-seven important personnel from the German spy agency Oehard, which continued to engage in espionage work for Japan after Germany surrendered, were on trial again yesterday by the US Military Tribunal. The person who testified was Major Hidakao, the former Chief of Intelligence of the Japanese Army stationed in China. He cited an example of the cooperation between the Oehard Bureau and the Japanese military authorities, stating that during the Okinawa campaign, the Japanese army relied on reports from the Guangzhou branch of the Oehard Bureau to find the location and deployment of the US Navy and Marine Corps. The report was signed by the head of the Guangzhou branch, Hi Ying, and bore the branch's code. At this point, the defendant's defense presented a document signed by the witness, stating that it could not be determined who wrote the report because the witness was in Nanjing at the time, and the report came from Guangzhou and was forwarded by the Intelligence Department of the 23rd Japanese Army in South China.</p>
<p>Therefore, the defense argued that the witness's words were contradictory and unreliable. However, the prosecutor, Major Dewey, pointed out that the document provided by the defense was not signed in the presence of US military personnel, so it could not be established.</p>
<p>After a long and heated debate, the witness continued to testify. According to the witness, the main task of the personnel of each section of the Oehard Bureau was to intercept the radio communications of the US Navy and Marine Corps and translate their codes. After the Battle of Okinawa, the activities of the Japanese army in North China also relied on the intelligence of the Oehard Bureau.</p>
<h3>Daxiang Ship Owner Appeals for Return: Management Bureau Promises to Intervene</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Xu Zhongxin founded the Daxiang Shipping Company before the war, with a total of six ships. Five of them were sunk in the Jiangyin Fortress during the August 13th Incident. The only remaining ship, the Daxiang, was forcibly bought by the enemy. After the victory, the Management Bureau entrusted the China Merchants Bureau to keep it in custody. Xu Zhongxin applied for its return. After the Management Bureau requested instructions from the Executive Yuan, it was decided that the original owner should redeem it at a price of more than 100 million yuan. Xu Zhongxin has paid all the money, and the Management Bureau instructed the China Merchants Bureau to return the ship to Xu. However, the China Merchants Bureau stated that the Shipping Association believed that the ship was still in dispute and delayed its return. Xu Zhongxin recently appealed to the Management Bureau, and Liu Gongyun promised to intervene with the China Merchants Bureau. However, Xu Xueyu, the General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau, is currently not in Shanghai. The Management Bureau's opinion is that there are no property rights issues with the ship and that the China Merchants Bureau should return it.</p>

<h3>Ostensible Underground Work Used to Raise Funds; Selling Forged US Dollar Savings Bonds; Chen Gaoyong and Six Others File a Private Prosecution</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] This city's cultural, educational, and journalistic circles of Chen Gaoyong, Chu Yukun, Dai Jimin, Huang Dalin, Ji Xizong, You Zhi, and Wang Naixu, having been deceived by mistakenly purchasing forged US dollar savings bonds, have filed a complaint with the local court against Jin Dingguo and Chen Jue. It is alleged that last autumn, Jin and Chen, under the guise of raising funds for underground comrades, sold seventeen savings bonds of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China savings offices, and the Yunnan Branch of the Central Trust Bureau, each bond being in denominations of US$500, US$1,000, and US$1,500, totaling US$17,000, to various people. Chen Gaoyong, Chu Yukun, and the other seven, driven by patriotic zeal, helped resell them to relatives and friends. When the bondholders attempted to cash the savings bonds at the Bank of Communications in April of this year, they discovered that they were forgeries. Upon hearing this, Chen and the others presented all the savings bonds, and after examination by the Bank of Communications, they were confirmed to be entirely forged. They then filed a private prosecution with the local court, but Jin and Chen had already fled. The District Procuratorate held two hearings, but the defendants did not appear. Yesterday morning, the local court held a hearing, but the plaintiffs also did not appear, so the hearing was postponed. The local court has issued arrest warrants for the two defendants, Chen and Jin, and is attempting to bring them to justice.</p>

<h3>Xin Fu Chinese Medicine Store Initiates Expanded Lung Treatment and Free Medicine Campaign</h3>
<p>Registration Provisionally Set to Begin on the First of Next Month for 200 People</p>
<p>[Exclusive Report from This Column] Since this column published the verified prescription for lung disease sent by Zhang Xixian, Chief of the Fengxiang County Police Bureau in Shaanxi Province, on May 19, it has attracted close attention from all quarters. Dozens of letters inquiring about it arrive daily. Compiling the reports from patients who have taken the medicine, they all say that this prescription is indeed effective for first and second-stage pulmonary tuberculosis. Once tuberculosis is contracted, vitality is immediately lost, and if not properly treated and nurtured, recovery is rare. The harm to humanity is truly not insignificant! Our people have long been called the "Sick Man of East Asia," and the spread of tuberculosis is particularly widespread. It directly causes losses in spirit and finances, and indirectly worries the nation and the people. Mr. Ren Xia, of the Xin Fu Chinese Medicine Store at No. 14, Lane 522, Hankou Road in this city, recognizing this, independently launched a campaign on July 24 to donate medicine and prescriptions, and entrusted this column to handle the registration. All lung disease patients could apply. To date, more than 1,500 patients have applied and received medicine, with an average of ten doses per person. The cost of each dose is estimated at 2,000 yuan, so the total cost has exceeded 30 million yuan. Now, in order to expand the distribution and benefit the poor and sick, Mr. Ren recently suggested at a board meeting of the Chinese Medicine Trade Association that this matter be handled collectively by the Shan Qing Society of the Medicine Trade Association. The medicine would be raised from colleagues throughout the city. The entire board passed the motion, and Mr. Ni Xizhang, the chairman of the association, also expressed his strong support. Subsequently, the two directors of the association, She Shengyuan and Fang Bingzhang, were elected to be responsible for handling the matter. Registration will begin on November 1. All truly poor lung disease patients, after being certified by the Jia and Bao chiefs, can come to the hall to fill out an application. Once the application is approved, they can begin receiving medicine. According to those with experience, lung disease patients need to take about 50 to 60 doses continuously to be effective. Those who stop after taking only ten doses will have no effect at all. This time, each person will receive about 50 or more doses, with the aim of curing the disease. This is truly good news for the poor and sick. (Yan)</p>

<h3>Leather Industry in Difficult Circumstances; Unable to Bear New Taxes; Production Shrinking; Business Insufficient to Cover Expenses; Wages and Interest Too High; Competition Difficult</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At a time when industry and commerce are in recession and production is shrinking, the leather manufacturing industry in this city is also facing a desperate situation and will be unable to bear any new taxes. Yesterday afternoon at 7:00 PM, the directors and supervisors of the industry association hosted the press at the Banking Club to lament the current situation of the industry. According to Zhang Shanzhang, chairman of the association, the leather manufacturing industry is currently facing a crisis and cannot bear the 15% commodity tax. Zhang then listed the four most serious difficulties currently facing the industry: (1) Heavy Taxes: (A) Business Tax: Regardless of wholesale or retail, a 15% tax is levied. From the raw material merchant (raw hide merchant) who sells to the manufacturer, who resells to the wholesaler, who resells to the retailer, or the leather product merchant, each merchant pays the tax once, resulting in overlapping taxation. (B) Stamp Tax: The stamp tax rate amended and promulgated in April of this year is 3 yuan per thousand yuan, which is equivalent to an additional 3% business tax, and the overlapping taxation overlaps with the business tax. (2) High Wages: Comparing wages before the war with the present, they have increased about 10,000 times, while the old price of finished leather is only 4,000 times higher than before the war. Currently, wages account for 13% of the total cost. (3) High-Interest Loans: Government production loans have strict restrictions on collateral and various procedures, making them difficult to obtain, while market interest rates are as high as 20% per month. Even at 15% per month, the manufacture of sole leather takes three months, and the interest cost accounts for 24% of the total cost. The manufacture of upper leather also takes one and a half months, and the interest cost accounts for 17% of the total cost. (4) Dumping of Foreign Goods: Due to the above three reasons, the cost of domestic leather is too high, while foreign goods have perfect mechanical equipment and particularly low costs. Moreover, because the exchange rate is only 1,000 times that of before the war, they can be dumped in large quantities in China. Currently, the cost of domestic sole leather is about 6,000 yuan per catty. However, the market price of first-class sole leather is only about 3,000 yuan. Sole leather from South America costs only a little over 2,000 yuan per pound. The cost of domestic bovine upper leather is more than 3,000 yuan per square foot (100 square inches). The market price is only about 2,000 yuan. Australian patterned leather of ordinary quality costs a little over 2,000 yuan per square foot (144 square inches). The quality is excellent, and the sizes are large. Therefore, even though domestic goods are so devalued, there is still a lack of sales.</p>
<p>For this reason, in the past three or four months, many colleagues have found that the proceeds from sales are insufficient to pay wages and business expenses. As a result, work is intermittent, and production has been greatly reduced. According to a survey last month, the monthly output of large and medium-sized leather factories has decreased from 100,000 pounds to 20,000 pounds. Dahua Factory has decreased from 60,000 pounds to 10,000 pounds. Zhongnan Factory has decreased from 60,000 pounds to 6,000 pounds. China Factory has decreased from 60,000 pounds to 14,000 pounds. Xieyuanchang has decreased from 15,000 pounds to 4,000 pounds. Handmade leather workshops are weak, and 20% of them are currently in a state of suspension. If this continues, the total collapse of the industry is just around the corner. Now, with the imposition of a commodity tax at a rate of 15%, which is ten times higher than the business tax, it will accelerate its demise, and thousands of workers will face unemployment. The factory owners will also be forced to change industries. The only result will be that raw hides will be exported, processed and manufactured by foreigners, and then imported as finished leather or manufactured goods. The loss of rights and interests is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>Finally, Du Gang, the executive director of the association, and Xi Yingkui, the supervisor, inquired separately, stating briefly that the people should have the obligation to pay taxes when the government levies new taxes. However, the premise should still be to consider whether the industry can afford it. Otherwise, the small loss will lead to a big loss, which will run contrary to the original intention of the state to develop industry. Therefore, they propose to postpone the imposition of the commodity tax until the crisis in the industry has passed, and then re-determine the tax rate and collect it lightly. It is said that the industry will send representatives to Beijing in the next few days to explain the difficult situation to the Central Government and request a postponement of the imposition of the commodity tax.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Stock Market Steady; Few US Dollar Transactions</h3>
<p>The situation in Shanghai yesterday was stable. The Central Bank continued to increase controls. The opening price in the morning was 1.305 million. There was still some sales to customers, and the buying interest had not diminished. It once rose to 2.22 million before encountering pressure. After stabilizing, it turned sideways. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 150 lots at a price of 2.2075 million. Afterward, it gradually turned from stable to weak, retreating to the 2.2 million level. The Central Bank slightly adjusted the market. The various parties were unable to support it and closed out their positions. By noon, it had fallen to 2.18 million. At noon, it hovered around the 2.19 million mark. The afternoon was very stable, struggling around the 2.2 million level. As a result, it was slightly down 12,000 yuan from last Saturday. Gold ornaments and silver ingots were both flat. Silver dollars were again sluggish in North sales, falling back a lot. Dark market trading was flat. Interest rates ranged from 15% to 18% per month.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange situation has gradually eased. The US dollar remained quiet. The British pound was at 14,700 yuan to 14,900 yuan, the Indian rupee was around 1,130 yuan, and the Hong Kong dollar was around 920 yuan, with some transactions. The retail price of the US dollar was still 3,500 yuan, but it was difficult to close deals. The dark market price was about 4,200 yuan to 4,400 yuan, with not much trading. The results were similar to last Saturday. The Hong Kong dollar fell from 930 yuan to 920 yuan for sale due to the rebound in Hong Kong telegraphic transfers and forward contracts. As a result, it was down slightly 1,000 yuan from last Saturday.</p>
<h3>Bond Market Dull</h3>
<p>Bond trading volume was no more than 3 million yuan. There was still no round lot trading between buyers and sellers. Most were scattered sales. A large account from Seventh Avenue made some modest purchases. The situation was still stable. The Unified Bond opened in the morning at 2,100 yuan. The high price was no more than between 2,150 yuan and 2,180 yuan. There was some slight struggle. Midway, it fell back below 2,050 yuan before stabilizing slightly. As a result, it was up slightly 30 yuan from the previous close. A and B bonds were also up 20 yuan. D and E bonds were flat.</p>
<h3>Ninghong New Goods Samples</h3>
<p>The first batch of this year's new Ningzhou black tea has arrived from Zhongxin Chang Tea Store, with more than 500 cases. Although samples are being displayed on the market, trading has not yet begun due to the surprisingly high prices demanded by sellers. Other varieties of aged tea with better quality are still favored by exporters. High-end black tea is especially closely watched by English companies. However, the process is not enthusiastic because of the scarcity of goods and lack of supply. As for this year's new special tribute tea and new Zhenmei tea, it is said that the Baitou firms are eager to try. They are currently planning to start negotiations with the suppliers. For domestic sales of red and green tea, Qimen floral tea and local tea factories welcome all comers. There were some inquiries about aged Wucao tea from stores on this street, but there were very few agreements.</p>
<h3>All Parties Watch and Wait; Sluggish Trading in Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were even more depressed. The counters of various hot stocks were also quite quiet. Over-the-counter scalping has gradually gained ground, and trading on the exchange has plummeted. The opening price in the morning initially showed a slight increase, but trading was very thin. Soon, it turned from stable to weak. The rise and fall in the middle were minimal, and it went all the way down. The floor traders took the opportunity to short. There were no twists and turns in the middle, only slight purchases from the Northern Gang, which could not resist the selling pressure. Near noon, short covering saw a brief rebound, but the buying interest was temporary. With the pressure of off-market supply never ceasing, it succumbed again at the close. Compared with last Saturday, Xinya Cement fell by one-tenth, Qinxing fell by eight-tenths of one-tenth, and Nei Yi, Wuhe, Zhongsi, Lilian, Tongyi, Xinwei, Zhongfang, Xinguang, and Jingfu each fell by about one-half of one-tenth. Yongsasha, Meiya, Datong Match, and Huafeng fell by two or three percent. Company Rongfeng and Jinglun fell slightly. The total turnover was about 7 million shares. In the off-market, various stocks continued to fall due to a lack of buyers.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were unable to rise. Apart from Yeguang, which was flat, small stocks were even more lackluster. Compared with last Saturday, Yisha and Yinglian Steel each fell by a little less than one-half of one-tenth. Yeguang was flat, while Navigation alone fell by more than one-tenth. The rest each fell by one-half.</p>
<h3>China Trust Allocates Rayon; Can Be Implemented Within This Week; Registration Procedures Must Be Completed Within Three Days</h3>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau previously shipped more than 4,000 cases of rayon from Japan and decided to distribute them fairly to various silk factories in the city for application. It is now known that the first allocation can be implemented within this week. The industry association is now handling the registration of each factory's purchase of rayon, which must be completed within three days. The association members are responsible for warning the registered manufacturers to fill in the amount according to actual needs and not to report falsely. If it is found that the actual usage does not match, not only will the right to allocate rayon be cancelled, but also the previous allocations will be recovered. It is said that the rayon allocated by the China Trust Bureau will be lower than that allocated by the China Textile Corporation. The previous allocation price of No. 120 Sky Bridge was 2.8 million yuan per case, while the China Trust Bureau will be about 2.56 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Sky Bridge Rises Another 50,000</h3>
<p>The market price of rayon has not yet stabilized. Yesterday, No. 120 Sky Bridge with luster consistently sold for 4.25 million yuan, with a decrease of 300,000 yuan in the middle. As a result, the weekend price rose by another 50,000 yuan. Various grades of miscellaneous brands with luster and semi-luster each rose by 50,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan. The factory and merchant market was calm, and trading was sluggish. There was also an abnormal shortage of spot goods. Yesterday, the transaction price for D-grade was 3.71 million yuan, but it was old silk, and the quality and color were not superior. The price of ordinary five-dan old orders was 3.55 million yuan, which was also second-rate. Dried silk was not seen trading. The silk goods market was lonely yesterday, with stagnant sales. Therefore, the prices of all goods did not increase or decrease.</p>
<h3>Silk Weaving Industry Plans to Establish a Public Treasury for Easy Mortgaging</h3>
<p>Responsible persons of the Shanghai Silk Weaving Industry Association said that the industry has been on the verge of danger in the past few months. The main reasons are the difficulty in obtaining raw materials and the heavy pressure of high-interest loans. At present, regarding raw materials, because the Japanese rayon has been shipped to 4,800 cases, and another 6,000 cases will continue to arrive, the China Trust Bureau will distribute them eight times a month according to the actual needs of each member manufacturer. Therefore, the raw material problem can be slightly solved. As for the pressure of high-interest loans, the association is currently discussing with the industry bank to organize an industry public treasury, so that each member manufacturer can mortgage raw materials and finished products to revitalize the use of funds. Methods are currently being drafted. Once the organization is successful, the future of the industry can be bright.</p>
<h3>Construction Fir Arrives</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the timber market was flat and weak for fir. It is said that about one million feet of goods arrived from Fujian. The price of foreign pine was stable, but plywood was still in demand. The price of Taichang Poplar Plywood Factory was 15,000 yuan per piece.</p>
<h3>Over-the-Counter Scalping Revives; A Serious Problem Facing the Stock Exchange</h3>
<p>The stock exchange market has not been prosperous, and brokers feel bored. Market funds have apparently failed to be introduced into the investment market, which was completely unexpected.</p>
<p>We know that the prosperity of the black market depends on the fact that there are many who use telephone conversations. The stock exchange once allowed legitimate brokers and salespersons to install five telephone lines for conversations. Brokers and brokers are absolutely not allowed to have telephone conversations, but this check has not been cashed.</p>
<p>There are also too few listed stocks. The American-style listing fees and annual fees make domestic manufacturers flinch. Among the first batch of 20 listed stocks, the five hot stocks are not available on the exchange. Investors are not very interested in the remaining dozen or so unpopular stocks. Conversely, too many good stocks are excluded from the exchange, which also makes investors hesitant to invest in stocks.</p>
<p>Over-the-counter scalping trading has gradually revived. How to lead floating funds from gambling-style scalping giants to the investment market for activity? How to prevent the spread of over-the-counter trading? This is really a serious problem facing us. (An Old-Timer)</p>
<h3>Flour is Controlled, But Wheat is Not; Manufacturers Say Raw Materials are Insufficient</h3>
<p>The flour market has become chaotic since the foreign exchange adjustment. Although the authorities control flour prices, they have not yet controlled wheat prices, resulting in rampant black market flour. Recently, the authorities have resolved to control flour prices and ordered the five major flour mills to increase sales. Yesterday, the responsible person of the Maoxin Flour Mill in this city said that the five major flour mills can at most sell 10,000 bags of flour per day. This is not because production is insufficient, but because the source of wheat is not smooth. Therefore, the flour mills urgently hope that wheat prices will be controlled and that the source will be unblocked to increase flour production.</p>
<h3>Flat Price Flour Distribution Method</h3>
<p>According to the current joint flat price flour distribution office of the five factories, since the distribution of flour began on the 25th of last month, about 120,000 bags have been distributed by last Saturday. Each bag weighs 44 catties, and the distribution price is 13,900 yuan. The distribution targets are all flour merchants. The office distributes 9,000 bags per day, except on Sundays or holidays. The application method is based on the flour numbers approved for the first time, totaling 70 companies, and the amount is approved according to past sales. According to the responsible person of the Flour Industry Association in the Fourth District, there are currently about 17 or 18 flour factories operating in this city, and they can produce 100,000 bags per day with existing equipment.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Firm; Miscellaneous Grains Turn Weak</h3>
<p>The rice market still has abundant river accumulation. Customers and goods registered more than 15,000 stones. The store side seized the opportunity to pick it up. The market shape was firm in the morning and weak in the afternoon. As a result, japonica rice was slightly weak, and indica rice was neither honored nor humiliated. The price of inland areas stood firm, temporarily forming a stalemate. However, white yuan goods were scarce, and retail was lively, continuing to rise by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Various roads of soybeans poured in, but they still could not get rid of their weak state. They were difficult to prosper. Broad beans were stagnant and fell by 1,000 yuan. The source of mung beans in the Jinpu southern section was also numerous, still lacking spirit and little trading, slightly less than 1,000 yuan in the middle and lower grades. Red sorghum stood firm. The shipment of sesame from Hankou was very high, and it continued to be downstream, falling by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The supply of raw peanuts exceeded demand, and the market was flat and weak. New adzuki beans decreased by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. However, wheat bran remained firm, and soybean cakes were unchanged. The prices of various oils decreased by 300 to 500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flat Price Unchanged; Existing Yarn Reported According to Order; Rising Trend Not Even Slightly Abated; Cotton Cloth Stagnant and Reduced by 2,000 to 3,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday morning, the yarn market initially softened because the association's bulletin earnestly warned industry insiders to report existing inventory truthfully according to the mayor's discussion. It is known that in the mayor's face-to-face discussion, the Cotton Yarn Industry Association ordered that cotton yarn registration be completed within a limited time. The deadline is very short, starting from now until tomorrow (16th). All cotton yarn quantities currently held by members of the Cotton Yarn Industry Association must complete registration procedures before 5:00 PM tomorrow, and reported by the association for verification. However, due to active sales to customers and the arrival of buyers, the Weaving Factory Gang purchased vigorously. In addition, the Changxi market walked on its own, gradually rising after the opening. 20-count yarn rose by 40,000 to 50,000, and 32-count fine yarn was especially short and in demand, rising by as much as 135,000, the same as 42-count double-strand thread. The foundation was very firm, and it did not weaken slightly due to the yarn registration.</p>
<p>The Yarn Joint Sales Association opened yarn as usual yesterday afternoon, with private factories allocating 651 pieces and the Fangjian Company allocating 617.5 pieces. The allocation price was based on 20-count yarn as the standard, still 1.55 million yuan per piece. The total group allocation of yarn in the second phase was 30,000 pieces. Among them, private factories accounted for 18,000 pieces, and there are currently 1,879 pieces remaining. Fangjian Company accounted for 12,000 pieces, and there are currently 1,451 pieces remaining. The various counts of cotton yarn opened by Fangjian Company yesterday were: 10-count Lima cone yarn allocated to the underwear and canvas industry; 20-count Fengnian allocated to the dyeing and towel industry; 32-count Lima allocated to the knitting, handkerchief, and camel fleece industry; 42-count Blue Phoenix allocated to the dyeing factory; and 60-count Rainbow Ball allocated to the underwear industry.</p>
<p>The cloth market was quite depressed, with no improvement, and prices were also weak. The reason was that customer gangs were quiet in purchasing, and the sales on this street were stagnant. It was because the season was late autumn, but the weather was still warm, so the overall sales were not smooth, and therefore gradually turned cold. Yesterday, the market price of Longtou fine cloth was 86,000 yuan, Blue V was 84,000 yuan, 20-count unlicensed fine cloth was 74,000 yuan, Four Gentlemen serge was 93,000 yuan, and Blue Chicken was 78,500 yuan. Among them, except for serge, the prices were reduced by about 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Therefore, yesterday's market price was also down 500 yuan to 1,000 yuan compared to the opening price of Fangjian last Saturday.</p>
<h3>Fangjian's New Initiative: Establishing a Company in the Northeast; Retail Department Opens Today</h3>
<p>The China Fangjian Company has now decided to establish a Northeast branch to manage textile production in the area. The company recently resolved at a board meeting that in order to develop yarn and cloth production in the Northeast and to understand the actual situation there, Deputy General Manager Wu Wei has been sent to the Northeast for observation. Mr. Wu left Shanghai by plane yesterday, transferred in Ping, and headed to the Northeast. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai in two weeks. In order to make it easier for citizens in this city to purchase various fabrics, the company has set up a retail department to sell various fabrics. It has now been prepared and will officially open today. According to the business director of the company, this retail department is the same as other stores in terms of business nature, and the prices are slightly cheaper than ordinary cloth stores.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar: Over 6,000 Tons Arrive, 18th Batch Already Distributed - Approximately 24,000 Bags</h3>
<p>The Taiwan Sugar Corporation recently had 6,200 tons of sugar delivered by the Tai-An Company's Tai-An ship. The ship arrived in port yesterday, and unloading has already begun. Furthermore, the 18th batch of Taiwan sugar has been distributed since last week, totaling 23,900 bags. The types include raw sugar, medium sugar, coarse sugar, first-grade white sugar, and thick first-grade white sugar, totaling five varieties. The allocated price for raw sugar is 110,000 yuan, medium sugar is 130,000 yuan, coarse sugar is 170,000 yuan, refined first-grade white sugar is 180,000 yuan, and solid first-grade white sugar is 150,000 yuan. A portion of this cargo has not yet left the warehouse, and the situation should be clear in the next day or two. It is understood that the 19th batch of Taiwan sugar is scheduled to begin distribution and sale this Thursday.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw minimal activity due to destocking. Transactions were scarce, and the guild marginally lowered prices. Spot market prices for 20th-grade medium white sugar were 188,000 yuan, and raw red sugar was 120,000 yuan. Only Shantou merchants offered green goods at 117,000 yuan. While cotton red sugar was quoted at 120,000 yuan, no transactions occurred. Xinghua white sugar sold for 128,000 to 129,000 yuan, with a total of a few hundred deals completed.</p>
<h3>Capital of 30 Billion Yuan: Aw Boon-Haw and Others Actively Preparing for the Fujian Economic Construction Company</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese are initiating the establishment of the Fujian Economic Construction Joint Stock Company. On September 8th, the preparatory committee convened at the Victoria Club in Singapore. Committee members Aw Boon-Haw and Lim Keng Lian, among others, attended or sent representatives. Aw Boon-Haw and Lim Keng Lian served as co-chairmen of the committee, with Aw Boon-Haw also serving as the director of preparations. Lim Keng Lian, He Bao-ren, Huang Chong-ji, and Huang Jing-cheng were elected as representatives for fundraising in various ports. The total capital amounts to 30 billion yuan in national currency, with 10 billion yuan to be raised in Malaya, 10 billion yuan in the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, Siam, Vietnam, and Burma, and 10 billion yuan in Fujian, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. The capital will be paid in two installments: half by the end of November this year and the other half by the end of January of the 36th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1947]. Those who pay in full at once will be accommodated.</p>
<h3>White Coal Price Exceeds Million-Yuan Mark: Supply Disrupted, Market Inventory Dwindling</h3>
<p>The coal market sees white coal lump, Yangquan, and Jiaozuo varieties experiencing dwindling inventories due to a lack of new shipments. Vendors are tightly holding onto prices, with asking prices reaching as high as 1.05 million yuan, with some minor transactions occurring between 1 million and 1.02 million yuan. Although New Hongji's current allocation is small, the presence of Kaibao and Mark white coal varieties has resulted in prices lower than those of Yangquan, with transaction prices rising slightly by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan compared to the previous market.</p>
<h3>The Suffering of the Import Industry: Approximately Six Grievances</h3>
<p>Since the victory [end of WWII], everyone knows that the most profitable business is the import industry. However, according to importers, there are many difficulties: (1) The United Kingdom and the United States have very strict controls on imports and exports. Exported goods must be approved by those countries, and export permits are sometimes even revoked while goods are being loaded onto ships. (2) Export manufacturers have no fixed delivery times. (3) According to the provisional measures for foreign exchange management, after applying for foreign exchange, settlement must be completed within three months. If settlement cannot be completed by the deadline, the Central Bank will purchase the exchange at the market price on that day, meaning that even before a transaction is successful, exchange rate and handling fee losses must be incurred. (4) For the sake of cost and reducing trouble, most merchants tend to purchase the same goods, leading to a surplus of certain items. (5) Damage during transit and theft at the docks. (6) High-interest loans: When placing orders, applying for foreign exchange typically requires a deposit of 30% to 50%. However, there is no guarantee of delivery dates. At a compound interest rate of 1.67% per month, the interest will equal the principal in just five months of non-arrival. If the time is extended, the profit margin will be even smaller.</p>
<h3>Autumn Silk Harvest Only 10,000 Dan</h3>
<p>According to a silk industry magnate, this year's autumn silk harvest in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is the worst in a decade. A total of 320,000 sheets of autumn silkworm eggs were sold to silkworm farmers in Jiangsu Province, and 180,000 sheets in Zhejiang Province, totaling 400,000 sheets. With an estimated yield of 6.5 jin of dry cocoons per sheet, the total amount of dry cocoons should have been 25,000 dan. However, since the autumn silk harvest began, silk factories from various regions have been opening for business and purchasing in the production areas. As of the 13th, Jiangsu Province has collected approximately 23,000 dan of fresh cocoons, which can only be converted into 8,000 dan of dry cocoons based on a conversion rate of 290 jin of fresh cocoons to one dan of dry cocoons. The autumn cocoon production in Zhejiang Province has been even more drastically reduced, with the province only collecting approximately 4,500 dan of fresh cocoons, which can only be converted into approximately 1,600 dan of dry cocoons using the same conversion rate. The total amount of dry cocoons collected is only around 10,000 dan. The price of fresh cocoons is lower in Jiangsu, at 160,000 yuan per dan, while it is higher in Zhejiang, at 180,000 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Tong'an Dried Longan Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Recently, due to a shortage of ships, Tong'an dried longan has not been transported, and sporadic sales here have led to gradually increasing prices. However, destocking has not been particularly smooth. According to telegrams from the production area yesterday, prices have increased by another 20,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>National Physical Education Implementation Plan: Ministry of Education Intensifies Supervision and Promotion in Provinces and Cities</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing] Since the Ministry of Education's Organizational Regulations for the National Physical Education Committee were approved and promulgated by the National Government last summer, the Ministry has been restructuring its physical education administration, expanding its organization, appointing representatives from relevant departments, and inviting individuals with research contributions in physical education. Ministry members have also been assigned to form the National Physical Education Committee and undertake various physical education initiatives. The organization of the National Physical Education Committee, its actual staff, and its tasks are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>Organization</p>
<p>The National Physical Education Committee consists of 21 members. In addition to one representative each from the Ministries of Interior, Military Administration, Conscription, Social Affairs, Military Training, and the Department of Health, as well as the Director of the Social Education Department of the Ministry of Education and one advisor, totaling eight individuals, the Ministry of Education has appointed 13 individuals with research or significant contributions to physical education, namely Hao Gengsheng, Yuan Dunli, Dong Shouyi, Wu Yunrui, Fang Wanbang, Ma Yuehan, Wu Bangwei, Kuang Zi, Xu Minhui, Jin Zhaojun, Zhang Jiwu, Cheng Dengke, and Jiang Lianggui, who are all physical education experts.

In addition, there are several staff members and assistant staff members who carry out the tasks of each group under the direction of their supervisors.</p>
<p>Tasks</p>
<p>The tasks of the National Physical Education Committee are:</p>
<p>Eight: (1) Planning and implementation of national physical education plans; (2) Guidance and assessment of national physical education; (3) Review of national physical education funding; (4) Inspection and statistics of national physical fitness; (5) Training and certification of physical education teachers; (6) Research on physical education academic subjects; (7) Management of sports competitions; (8) Other national physical education matters. It is reported that under the leadership of Minister Zhu, the committee is vigorously promoting its work. The Ministry of Education has recently intensified its supervision of the National Physical Education Committees of education departments in all provinces and cities across the country to actively promote national physical education implementation plans. It is also reported that Yuan Dunli will travel abroad to recruit foreign physical education experts to assist in the promotion of national physical education in China.</p>

<h3>Bloodstains on Sumatra: Inside the Second Riot in Indonesia</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Bagan Apiapi, Sumatra, September 20th, by Mao Ming</p>
<p>Since the resolution of the conflict with Indonesia on March 12th of this year, which was caused by the humiliation of the national flag, the murder of the overseas Chinese leader, and the burning of houses, the authorities of the Bagan Apiapi Overseas Chinese General Association have clearly recognized that in these extraordinary times, the prosperity and safety of the area can only be achieved by promoting harmony and unity between the Chinese and Indonesian people. Therefore, they have made every effort to engage in national diplomacy, hoping to avoid disaster during this difficult period and preserve the lives and property of the overseas Chinese in the port. They have spared no effort to assist with government measures, celebrating or participating in celebrations of Indonesian commemorative days. They have also held lavish banquets for the arrival of officials from the Bukit Batu and Qianba Ru areas. Recently, in response to the government's proposal, they organized an international club with the participation of Chinese, Malay, and Indonesian people. The club was formally established on September 3rd.</p>
<p>The Occurrence and Development of the Incident</p>
<p>However, some Indonesian extremists, especially military personnel, were dissatisfied with the peaceful resolution of the March 12th incident (which was mediated and signed by the Bukit Batu Governor). Extremists in the Asahan and Tanjungbalai areas have always viewed the overseas Chinese as meat on the chopping block and were even more dissatisfied with the Bagan government's (supposed) weakness toward the overseas Chinese. Moreover, in these areas, the troops were disorganized, vying for power and profit. They felt the need to find new territory to satisfy their selfish desires. Therefore, about two months ago, the so-called Tanjungbalai naval forces (long-haired) occupied the town of Liba Ham, under local jurisdiction, without notifying the local government. They forcibly requisitioned military rations from the local overseas Chinese, detaining and beating them, leaving no abuse uncommitted. At that time, the General Association immediately contacted the local government and telegraphed Bukit Batu requesting that the foreign troops be ordered to leave the area. Although the government agreed to comply, it had no effect. Several weeks ago, the troops advanced to the town of Gui Wu, only two hours by water from the port. The goods of overseas Chinese merchants were taken. A Malayan cargo ship was detained in nearby waters, and two Hainanese overseas Chinese were killed. The troops then intercepted ships at sea, robbing commercial vessels and properties. The General Association reported the situation to the local government and requested that they be suppressed, but although the government agreed, nothing was done. Finally, the local magistrate and police chief repeatedly assured the General Association that if the troops continued to disobey orders, the government would take necessary measures. They also stated that unless authorized in advance by the government, the troops were not allowed to land at the port. They would use force if necessary. With the government's assurances, the overseas Chinese were less fearful, and residents were able to live and work in peace.</p>
<p>Later, a national army colonel from Bukit Tinggi, the police chief of Bukit Batu, the Bukit Batu Governor, the military police chief, and dozens of armed troops came to the port together. They said their mission was to resolve the problems of Liba Ham and Gui Wu. The overseas Chinese felt gratified that the government was paying attention to dealing with the undisciplined troops. After arriving at the port, the officials also summoned overseas Chinese leaders to talk, urging the Chinese and Indonesians to cooperate and be friendly. The overseas Chinese leaders all agreed. On the morning of September 18th, the officials borrowed a motorboat from the Chinese, saying they would personally go to the town of Gui Wu to resolve the rebellious Tanjungbalai navy. However, they only took a small number of troops with them. About an hour after the boat left, it returned, accompanied by another motorboat towing several sampans. The boats were full of troops. The overseas Chinese were quite surprised. When they saw the troops land on the dock, numbering about two hundred, armed and ready, most of whom were Tanjungbalai troops, the overseas Chinese fled along the way. Shops closed their doors, and order broke down. At this time, the General Association personnel came out to persuade the overseas Chinese to calm down and not misunderstand. As soon as the troops left the customs office, they split into one group that went to the government offices with the officials, and another group that fired their guns as a signal and rushed to the city center. The leader carried a machine gun and shot at anyone he encountered. A Chaozhou person could not avoid it and fell to the ground. The overseas Chinese, seeing that the situation had reached a critical point, took up arms and returned fire. The sound of gunfire erupted, and a fierce street battle began. The Indonesian machine gunner and several vanguards were shot and retreated to the customs warehouse. The overseas Chinese surrounded the entrance to the customs office. On the other hand, the Indonesian troops in the barracks immediately surrounded the Chinese residential area and occupied the Chinese rubber factory (a four-story building) as a fortress, controlling several streets. With enemies on both sides, the overseas Chinese were in a precarious situation. They decided to eliminate the Tanjungbalai bandits in the customs warehouse first. After several charges, they finally drove the bandits back at 1 p.m. At night, both sides were on high alert, but there was no contact. However, the overseas Chinese were extremely worried because a large number of women and children in the residential area were under enemy control, and news was cut off. They could not sleep all night. On the morning of the 19th, gunfire resumed, but both sides adopted a defensive posture. A small group of overseas Chinese families risked escaping from the line of fire at dawn and fled into the city, reporting the atrocities of the Indonesian troops. They said that several women and children had been killed, and most had been detained. All the residences had been looted. This news increased the overseas Chinese's worry.</p>
<h3>Three Hours of Desperate Fighting: Indonesians Retreat and Raise White Flag</h3>
<p>The General Association, fearing that the situation was getting out of control, selected an Indonesian to convey the General Association's intentions, requesting the police station and officials to find a way to mediate the dispute and begin peace negotiations. Two hours later, they received a reply from the government agreeing to peace talks, requesting that all members of the General Association carry a white flag to the magistrate's office for negotiations, with the government guaranteeing the safety of the members to and from. The General Association requested that the government send representatives to negotiate in the city, and the General Association would protect the safety of the government representatives. However, the government did not respond, and the Indonesian troops intensified their attack. They relied on superior weapons, controlled most of the intersections, and shot at anyone they encountered, cutting off traffic in many parts of the city. The situation was extremely dire. The overseas Chinese felt that death was imminent.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "A cornered beast will still fight." Even more so with humans. When backing water as a battle position, one will have no mercy for the category if cannot win. Therefore, those with more strategic sense rose up to encourage a counterattack, and many responded. The initial goal was to retake the rubber factory. They advanced in several directions, bravely charging forward regardless of the gunfire. After two hours of fierce fighting, the Indonesians were unable to hold out and retreated. The rubber factory was recaptured, and they took the opportunity to recapture the Zhonghua Public School and the Minde Bookstore (both in the residential area). At this time, the overseas Chinese families trapped in the area escaped to the city. Morale was extremely high, and they took advantage of the momentum to besiege the barracks and quickly captured it. Then they occupied the post and telegraph office (with ambush inside). Finally, they surrounded the police station (the police station had the most weapons. Since it could not maintain order, it should have remained neutral, but the police station supplied the Indonesian troops with a large number of weapons and continued to shoot at the residences and residents). At this time, the number of mobilized people reached one or two thousand. The sound of gongs and flutes was endless, and the momentum of the charge was overwhelming. They finally surrounded the police station. The police were frightened and fled. Finally, the police chief surrendered with a white flag. This counterattack was a concerted effort by the overseas Chinese, with the force of a thunderbolt. In just three hours, the Indonesian reactionary forces in the city were cleared, and five or six hundred overseas Chinese women and children who had been detained were able to celebrate their survival. The remaining Indonesian forces fled into the forests outside the city.</p>
<p>According to reports, the Indonesian troops originally planned to massacre the overseas Chinese prisoners in the concentration camp in an emergency. However, the Indonesian in charge of the concentration camp took the keys and fled. Although the Indonesian troops used a knife to cut the lock open, the overseas Chinese had already arrived, which was truly a dangerous situation. It was also reported that some of the detained women and children were beaten and raped by Indonesian troops.</p>
<p>Looking at this incident, the speed of the Indonesian troops' actions clearly indicates a planned conspiracy. The government repeatedly promotes friendship and cooperation, yet now it uses the excuse of resolving the rebel army in Gui Wu to concentrate military forces from various places to attack us. Troops are not used to defend against foreign enemies but to harass the people. How can this not arouse public anger?</p>
<p>The purpose of the Indonesian troops' provocation this time was: 1. To avenge the failure of the reckless actions on March 12th. 2. Because Indonesia's economic power is weak, they want to suppress the city by force and then extort money from the overseas Chinese at will.</p>
<p>The Indonesian troops were well-trained and had sufficient weapons. They gathered elite troops from various places, as well as police and thugs, numbering thousands, and had a pre-planned plan. Yet, they were defeated in a short period of two days by the overseas Chinese, who had no training, lacked weapons, and were unprepared. This is because the overseas Chinese fought for self-defense and survival, and they were righteous. The Indonesians used violence to invade others, which is against reason. Therefore, as soon as they made contact, they collapsed. However, the casualties among the overseas Chinese also reached more than a hundred.</p>

<h3>Guard Against Another Indonesian Counterattack: Overseas Chinese Actively Deploy and Call for Rescue</h3>
<p>After the incident on the morning of the 18th, the Indonesians telegraphed various places to request reinforcements. That night, the overseas Chinese also sent representatives to Consul General Wu and compatriots in Malaya to ask for assistance. By the night of the 19th, the overall situation in the port had stabilized, but they feared that Indonesian reinforcements from other places would continue to arrive, and if they could not resist, more than 20,000 overseas Chinese would be massacred. Therefore, on the night of the 20th, they sent four more representatives to Malaya to call for rescue, and seven injured people (with bullets still lodged) were transported to Malaya for treatment.</p>
<p>On the 21st, the entire city actively deployed defenses, using cars to transport rubber sheets and piling them up at various intersections as substitutes for sandbags to facilitate defense. In the afternoon, armed troops escorted about a hundred Indonesian women and children back to the suburbs. According to investigations, two motorboats carrying Indonesian reinforcements were anchored in the port of Yaluo, about seven kilometers from the port. The port is accessible from both land and sea.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 22nd, it was learned that the Indonesian reinforcements numbering more than a hundred had landed at the port of Yaluo. Fearing that reinforcements would continue to concentrate and surround the city with local defeated soldiers, they decided to strike first and catch them unprepared. They sent troops by land and sea. At 11:00 a.m., two motorboats returned from Malaya, reporting that Consul General Wu had contacted the British and Dutch authorities to request support. He also visited Lord Killion, a special envoy of the British, asking him to mediate the Dutch-Indonesian dispute in Batavia and protest to Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir. The motorboats also transported some supplies, which slightly eased the anxiety of the overseas Chinese. In the afternoon, the attacking troops returned safely. They said the enemy troops were hiding deep in the forest, with no trace, and they could not fight. The two motorboats anchored in the port belonged to overseas Chinese in Malaya and had been seized by the Indonesian authorities in Pekanbaru to transport troops. The troops had two machine guns and dozens of rifles. The attacking troops immediately released the two seized motorboats back to their port. According to the motorboat personnel, the Jinhaili motorboat carrying the overseas Chinese representatives and seven injured people was detained by the Indonesians off the coast of Qianba Ru and taken to Bukit Batu. The lives of the personnel are unknown, and the overseas Chinese are very anxious.</p>
<p>At 9:30 a.m. on the 23rd, two Allied aircraft circled over the city to survey the ground situation for about ten minutes. The morale of the overseas Chinese was boosted, as if they had received reinforcements. According to reports from overseas Chinese returning from Malaya, this was the result of the consul's contact with the governor. In the afternoon, it was reported that 300 overseas Chinese in Gui Wu had been detained and eight had been killed, but the exact details were unknown. The defense force held a meeting in the afternoon to discuss strengthening the armed organization and electing commanders and deputy commanders, and dividing the troops into naval and land defense teams.</p>
<p>Because enemy ships continued to transport reinforcements and detain ships, the armed Hailong vessel patrolled the sea on the morning of the 24th. Aircraft came to reconnoiter again in the morning. Many roadside vendors have resumed business today. According to news from overseas Chinese in Qianba Ru, the Indonesian troops there have retreated and the overseas Chinese are safe.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 25th, aircraft came to reconnoiter again. Overseas Chinese at the dock signaled for help with flags. Crowds were prohibited from watching on the road, and order was fairly good. In the afternoon, fishermen at sea reported that a Chinese crew member of an Asahan motorboat had told them that Asahan had sealed up fourteen motorboats in preparation for transporting reinforcements here, urging Bagan overseas Chinese to pay attention. According to a refugee from the village, more than 30 overseas Chinese in the village of Bentongga have been massacred. As a result, people were panic-stricken and could not live in peace. In the evening, radio stations in London and Chongqing reported the Bagan incident, saying that the government would send representatives to investigate the truth. Also, the motorboat that carried three seriously injured people to Malaya this morning was detained by the Indonesians at sea again. After the Hailong vessel pursued it, the motorboat was released, but five overseas Chinese were arrested and taken away.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 26th, aircraft continued to reconnoiter as usual. The overseas Chinese wrote English words on white cloth and placed them on the dock, stating "Surrounded, please rescue quickly." In the evening, Chongqing Radio said: "According to a dispatch from Batavia, the conflict between the Chinese and Indonesians in Bagan has gradually eased. Consul General Jiang expressed that a joint Chinese-Indonesian investigation team has departed since the 25th. According to a high-ranking Indonesian official who went to Batavia from Sumatra, the incident was caused by agitators who claimed to be the Indonesian Navy but were actually Dutch spies after arriving in Bagan." "Welcome the arrival of the investigation team." This resolved the Indonesian extremists' riot. The brave resistance of the overseas Chinese was purely for self-defense. If they had not defeated the bandits, they would have been massacred. What they hope for is to live and work in peace, so they hope that the investigation team can complete its mission as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Glimpses of Zhengzhou</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Zhengzhou, 2nd Day of the Month, by Reporter Wang Shoumei</p>
<p>The car arrived in Zhengzhou, and it was almost dark. I followed a teahouse attendant who was touting for business at the station to a hotel. I looked at a few, and they were all dilapidated and terribly dirty. There were no satisfactory rooms. But the prices were not low. It cost three thousand yuan a day, including tea and a 10% tax. A traveler would have to spend four or five thousand yuan a day. Not to mention eating. A meal costs two or three thousand yuan. The cost of living in Zhengzhou is indeed twice as high as in Kaifeng.</p>
<p>Zhengzhou is crossed by the Longhai and Pinghan railways, forming a key transportation hub in the Central Plains. Every day, it welcomes travelers from different places, and every day, it sends out many travelers, allowing them to reach their destinations. Zhengzhou is reviving from desolation and moving towards prosperity day by day.</p>
<p>Devastated and Unable to Recover</p>
<p>Zhengzhou is a city that has been devastated and destroyed by the enemy. It has not yet recovered. The superficial bustle cannot hide the inner desolation. There is not a single decent and clean street here. The constant stream of cars, jeeps, and trucks stir up a lot of dust, making it uncomfortable to breathe.</p>
<p>Datong Road and Dehua Street are the first places to prosper here. The goods in the shops are all shipped from Hankou or Shanghai. Not many. In the evening, the streets are full of pedestrians, but the dazzling gasoline lamps in the shops do not attract them. It turns out that many of the people gathered here are stranded due to the war and the disruption of transportation.</p>
<p>This is a city of mixed elements and very chaotic order. There have been two robberies recently, but they were quickly solved by Commander Liu Jiakang, who is responsible for security. Director Gu Jian of the Pacification Headquarters has ordered Commander Liu to rectify military discipline. Under strict implementation, the results are quite significant. Today, the troops stationed in various cities have given people a very bad impression due to their poor attitude and discipline.</p>
<p>Different Atmosphere Compared to Kaifeng</p>
<p>Zhengzhou and Kaifeng are two cities only 140 li apart, but the atmosphere in the two cities is completely different. One is too quiet, and the other is too dynamic. If Kaifeng is compared to Beiping, then Zhengzhou is a bit like Tangshan. Both the too quiet and too dynamic cities give people an uncomfortable feeling of suffocation. Zhengzhou does not have a decent newspaper that can be considered a newspaper, and the readers are taken away by the Kaifeng and Hankou newspapers of the day. Who wouldn't say this is a joke? The bookstores here, like those in Kaifeng, are full of soft and obscene reading materials, and spiritual food is lacking. If you are not too vulgar, you will feel deeply lonely. In the old theaters, places where Henan opera and storytelling are performed are packed with people. There are no decent cinemas, and they are all showing films from the enemy-puppet era. Although the drama troupe led by Xu Sheng and the drama troupe of the Political Department of the Pacification Headquarters are constantly performing, they cannot break the silence here. Naturally, their spirit of hard work is worthy of admiration. In order to strengthen activities and strive for new progress, the Zhengzhou branch of the Chinese Drama Association was established under the leadership of Chen Zhong, the deputy captain of the drama propaganda team, to promote the improvement of old dramas. It is hoped that this group of pioneers will continue to work tirelessly in the traditional spirit of drama workers.</p>
<p>Remarkable Achievements in Epidemic Prevention and Disaster Relief</p>
<p>Zhengzhou, a city with three or four thousand prostitutes, has a large number of customers in the Xiaoyao Lane where the prostitutes gather. The chaotic situation is conceivable. The fraud case that occurred the other day happened in a brothel. In response to these phenomena, Commander Liu, in conjunction with the commissioner and county magistrate, is carrying out a census, Baojia organization, self-defense team training, and general training for all levels, strengthening security work, and systematically bringing this disordered city onto the right track. Even the old graveyard in the northwest corner, a gathering place for vendors, rogues, local bullies, and stray soldiers, has been transformed into a national market, with streets laid out to ensure that "people must be registered in households, and households must be registered in Jia" to reduce the lurking and activities of bandits and thieves.</p>
<p>Zhengzhou is a dirty city, and an epidemic is currently prevalent. The health committee organized by the authorities is carrying out epidemic prevention, clearing garbage, tidying up sewers, and building public toilets. The working team of the Relief Administration is also spraying DDT and forcing residents to be vaccinated at intersections to reduce the threat of disease to the city's residents.</p>
<p>Disaster relief efforts are being promoted here, and the results are better than in Kaifeng. They show their work achievements, unlike Kaifeng, which uses "quiet streets" to please people. The term "quiet streets" has been forgotten in other places since the Northern Expedition!</p>
<p>The last time I came back from Shanghai, I passed through this city in a hurry, but this time I had the opportunity to stay for two days and fully observed the city, and I felt very happy. Zhengzhou is "chaotic" and "poor," but it is improving everywhere and full of vitality. This is exactly what makes us happy.</p>
<p>Tunnel between Fenggang and Taitung, Taiwan Province (Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun)</p>
<h3>A Journey in Tainan</h3>
<p>— A dispatch from Tainan on the 9th, by our special correspondent, Jiang Muyun</p>
<p>In mid-September, I, the reporter, departed from the provincial capital, Taipei, for a journey to the central and southern parts of the island, lasting half a month, and returned north late at night at the beginning of this month. The original plan also included trips to Penghu and Taitung, but the existing transportation had already become difficult, and the typhoon on September 25th further blocked the sea and mountain routes. More than a dozen doctors and nurses dispatched by the Health Bureau to Penghu County to provide emergency assistance for cholera were stranded in Kaohsiung hotels for more than two weeks. Even the Taiwan Transportation Vessel (台交丸) of less than a hundred tons could not operate on a regular schedule. Moreover, the highway from Pingtung to Hedong was already considered a daunting journey by travelers in normal times. Even if one could reach Taitung, the coastal highway after Hualien Port had not yet been repaired in the Hualien County section since the last earthquake. These two places were obviously isolated from the rest of the province, directly impacting my plan to circumnavigate the island, forcing me to return to Taipei prematurely.</p>
<p>Grain Collection Exceeds Expectations</p>
<p>Without visiting the central and southern parts of Taiwan, one would not know its size, let alone its wealth. Historically, the central and southern regions were cultural centers and political hubs. They possess a vast plain, yielding two harvests of grain each year. Favorable weather conditions and man-made irrigation systems ensure abundant agricultural production. More than three million farmers live and die here. In the past, Japanese public and private landholdings accounted for 60 percent. Taiwan Takushoku Co., Ltd. was the most exploitative of the big landlords. Farmers had to pay half of their harvest for the rulers' allocation of fertilizer and seeds, and they also had to sell their food grains cheaply, offering their blood and sweat to the rulers. After the retrocession (光復), this tenancy system has obviously undergone major reforms. Some Japanese-owned land has been transferred to farmers for cultivation, and some government-owned land has been leased to farmers at low rents. This is reflected in the unprecedented grain collection, which has achieved 80 to 90 percent success, sufficient to illustrate the depth of farmers' sense of obligation to pay taxes. However, farmers are most concerned about how the government will use the collected rice and loan funds, because this will be the blueprint for next year and an excellent test of political measures. However, the government is not without its questionable aspects. The assessment of barren mountains and forests, and unproductive "敷地" (real estate), has increased more than eighty times since 1937, making it impossible for taxpayers to bear, and the failure to consider this beforehand has ultimately led people to lodge "protests" (raising protests is just a catchphrase among the people of this province), fostering a new atmosphere.</p>
<p>A New Trend of Opposing Reality</p>
<p>During my two weeks in the major cities of southern Taiwan, I also came into contact with local gentry, youth, farmers, and workers from all walks of life, as well as county and city councilors representing public opinion. They all had a bellyful of grievances to vent and countless questions that needed answering. They often used the enthusiasm and passion of the previous year, full of hope, to challenge reality. In general, cursing reality and hating the status quo were the main themes of their conversations and discussions. To put it bluntly, in their disappointment, they have created a new atmosphere of opposing the government.</p>
<p>The result of this new atmosphere is discord and alienation between the people and the government, the military and the people, and the people and the people. Short-sighted provincials blame it on the mainlanders (外省人). In the south, they call mainlanders "阿山吓," a sarcastic term. In Kaohsiung Port, the distance between the two is even greater. Some minor incidents often trigger major disturbances, and some problems that shouldn't be problems become big problems. We cannot say that the provincials are making a mountain out of a molehill, because they have been separated from the motherland for too long, and their temperament is narrow, impatient, and bears the characteristics of a tropical industrial region. But in this way, local officials and satirical workers are often greatly disheartened.</p>
<p>People ask, why does public opinion provoke the feelings between the government and the people? And the people blame the government for not facing reality, adopting public opinion, and maintaining a great distance from the people.</p>
<h3>Gentry Who Monopolize Public Opinion</h3>
<p>In Taiwan, the councilors who represent public opinion are mostly medical professionals. In the past, the Japanese allowed Taiwanese to obtain medical doctorates but restricted general opportunities for secondary and higher education. After the retrocession, they were elected by the people as local county and city councilors, and some even served concurrently as township chiefs. I attended the meeting of 76 township chiefs convened by the Tainan County government in Xinying. Most of them were county councilors, and some were doctors, with education levels above middle school. They still retain their previous ideas about township chiefs, respecting themselves and being respected by others. This situation is the same in Kaohsiung County, where 29 of the 56 councilors also serve as township chiefs. Before the government decided to implement the popular election of township/district chiefs after the 16th of this month, it issued two orders: first, current councilors may not concurrently serve as township chiefs; second, members of the Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association (皇民奉公會) may not hold public office. The former have mostly resigned from their township chief positions and now serve solely as councilors. The latter has made councilors feel uneasy. In fact, some of those who distinguished themselves during the Japanese era are now quite prominent, especially the councilors in each locality. For example, in Chiayi City's 21 councilors, it is said that only two did not belong to the former Imperial Rule Assistance Association. Provincials said with indignation that the government-appointed gentry monopolized public opinion, but apart from this group of gentry, how many councilors can be selected? This is the problem. The government, for this reason, has had to adopt a tolerant attitude and establish a method of reporting, which is the government's dilemma.</p>
<p>Factory Closures and Unemployment Become a Problem</p>
<p>What makes provincials dissatisfied with reality is the high prices and rampant corruption. Regarding prices, they compare them to those of the previous year. In fact, it is difficult for an island to avoid external waves. Regarding corruption, the government encourages people to provide concrete facts and deal with them strictly according to the law, but they cannot do so, only roar and complain. I asked several supervisors in charge of a certain unit, all of whom were provincials. He said very frankly that narrow-minded and disunited provincial compatriots are really not easy to deal with. At the time of retrocession, they thought that the positions held by the Japanese should rightly belong to the provincials. In fact, this was not the case. Taiwan province cannot detach itself from the mainland and unify everything on its own. As a result, they were disappointed. Currently, the only thing they consider serious is the unemployment problem, which is indeed a fact. I visited three sugar factories in the south, one of which was the Pingtung branch of Taiwan Sugar Corporation, which has a production capacity of 3,000 tons of white sugar. It is currently shut down. Taiwan Sugar Corporation plans to restore some factories this year, but the area of sugarcane fields has obviously shrunk to two-fifths. Especially in the rice-sugarcane interchangeable area around Taichung, people are very doubtful and unwilling to plant sugarcane, even though the company has repeatedly advertised that fertilizer is available and provides loans of 3,000 to 6,000 yuan per hectare (15 mu) for sugarcane seedlings and 3,000 to 4,000 yuan for cultivation, but they still hesitate. Sugarcane, which could not be sold retail before, is now available everywhere in the market, and workers look at the sugarcane fields and sigh. Along with sugarcane, factories such as paper and alcohol factories are also shut down. The butanol factory in Chiayi City had more than 3,000 employees at its peak, with total assets of over 20 million yuan, producing gasoline, ammonia, wine, insecticides, etc. Currently, it requires NT$30 million in repairs to resume work. Now there are more than 200 workers, and the capitalists, due to soaring raw material prices, cannot immediately repair and start work, and must lay off another half, leaving 100 people to serve as guards. When I visited, these employees were discussing privately, panicking about the unemployment problem. Other agricultural product processing factories, and even Fengtian (豐田), are the same. The high prices of raw materials and labor force the factories to stop production. If they don't produce, it's already a loss. Once they produce, they suffer a loss. This is a crisis.</p>
<h3>Boundless Autumn Scenery in the North</h3>
<p>— A dispatch from Beiping on September 28th, by Yuxin</p>
<p>The "intermittent" autumn rains in the Beiping-Tianjin area have not cleared for several days. After an investigation, Beiping can be summed up in one sentence: "Walls have collapsed, houses have fallen, roofs are overgrown with grass, and the ground is muddy." Especially in the dilapidated and poorly maintained houses in the embassy district outside Xuanwumen, most of the roofs are "wide open" after the rain, or they are leaning east and west. Those that have not been smashed by the rain have a pile of green grass growing below the ridge. As a gentle breeze passes, new small grasses nod frequently to the passing pedestrians in front of the eaves, as if they are congratulating themselves. In addition, in the crooked alleys, after a small rain that greets the sun, you can see mud everywhere and it is difficult to find a foothold. Pedestrians on the road have the suffering of "I can't go, brother."</p>
<p>Recently, there have also been cases of collapsed houses at the Tianjin wharf, one after another.</p>
<p>The cleanup team people, after being urged a thousand times, finally appeared. The food grains in the warehouses that have been taken over for a long time in both places—these moldy substances have become the淤血 (stagnant blood) after victory. The sky is clearing! The issuance of a "suspension order" is tantamount to adding a thunderbolt from the blue to the retained personnel!</p>
<p>Some key intersections have added a layer of color and a new look to Beiping. Try touring Qianmen and Xidan, and you will know: the signs "烙," "烤," "涮" are hung high on the faces of the restaurants to attract old wives. Really, autumn insects are on the market. The area around Xuanwumen Shizi Street is a cricket "market." Buyers who love crickets flock here, picking those with high-pitched, strong, and powerful wings, which are called top-quality, priced at 5,000 yuan. Buyers spend money like dirt, and sellers are still reluctant to sell. Second-class crickets (crickets are also called 蟋蟀) are also worth hundreds or two hundred yuan.</p>
<p>The excavation of crickets accounts for the top spot in the world of autumn insects. This animal likes to lie dormant in soil that is not dry or wet. It is said that there are many people engaged in capturing them around Taoranting outside Xuanwumen in Beiping, especially children. A group of two or three people carry a set of furniture: an iron cover fence, a clay pot, a small cloth bag, and a hollow paper tube. The children are naive and funny, and some simply lie on the mounds to dig them out. They love to catch 二意儿 (crickets with two antennae), 三意儿, and 老米嘴. After a while, they use the paper tube to guide them into the pot for confinement. If they fight and call loudly in the pot, it will definitely cause great joy. The autumn clouds above these children's heads flutter and dance. The reed pond outside the Taoranting wall, like an ocean, is endless, decorating the boundless autumn scenery! At the same time, looking to both sides: the crops have all ripened, the peanuts are connected by four leaves, and purple flowers bloom on the eggplants, serving as a collar decoration for the young women of Qingqiu. How elegant and beautiful! The nearby tilted and uneven farmhouses, accompanied by these fields near and far, are worthy of being a pastoral city.</p>

<h3>The Errors of American Marriage</h3>
<p>— Duanmu Ping</p>
<p>One-fifth of American marriages end in divorce, and women aged 20 to 30 account for one-third of them. Why? American marriage is based on a ridiculous concept—illusory love—and emphasizes sensuality. Do those boys often regard their ideal wives as young mothers or operating partners, or do they think that sensuality is paramount? What will happen to the children born to the latter?</p>
<p>He may say that the children should be managed by women, and he himself is crazy about fulfilling his fatherly duties, but he is ashamed of the children. This kind of sexual love and romantic love blocks the brilliance of fatherly love.</p>
<p>The fundamental error of marriage is obvious. In America, no one teaches "fatherhood." But it is the basis of male existence. This instinct must come from experience, experience, and contact with a real father as a child. But after the children are born, most of those American fathers disappear. During the day, he is in the office, and at night he is either out or attending banquets, or he is too tired. The children are therefore very unfamiliar with him. The father's enthusiasm, understanding, example, and instinctive concern do not exist.</p>
<p>To act as a father or mother, our society has invented many things that lead children to victory—radio, storybooks, movies, kindergartens, or summer camps. Those school affairs are also handled by women, so 90 percent of American boys' lives are led and educated by women, and fathers despise their own responsibilities.</p>
<p>How many men have spent their energy, time, and money to concentrate on fatherhood? How many people have paid attention to the situation in schools? How many people have cleverly solved those early crimes? That is the duty given to men at home. Losing it can cause wives to worry and lead to many tendencies toward divorce.</p>
<p>But men should only bear half the responsibility for this kind of marriage. Girls are more inclined to illusory love. They pursue the kind of love that is found in books or movies, so when she has this feeling, she rushes to get married, thinking that there will be a perfect result. In this case, those heroes usually have no money. This kind of love ignores a few points: First, money cannot help a man's character, but on the contrary, it often spoils him. Second, marriage is not the conclusion of everything, nor can it guarantee perfection. Marriage is really just the beginning.</p>
<p>Most American brides in the fire believe that marriage is an endless courtship, treating marriage as the result of engagement. As long as they are materially comfortable, they can talk about the possibility of having children later. This is what they call love. After marriage, the method of courtship is cancelled. The family cannot be used as a future speculation. It is a place where the two sexes accompany each other. Marriage is inevitably for the basic solution of sex.</p>
<p>Infidelity is the biggest cause of divorce, and marriages based on adultery will be divorced sooner or later, because they have mistaken the purpose of being together for life.</p>
<p>Another point is that many American boys and girls hold the belief of "only one." If girls only date one boy, it is impossible to meet someone with a compatible personality. This "only one" belief can also be said to be an obstacle to marriage, because if a person dreams of an object before getting married, then he will apply the dream to life. In this case, many people think that marriage is wrong and endure it. In reality, their thoughts are wrong, and some even become nagging or indulgent because of disappointment; but most of them still pursue their "only one" after divorce.</p>
<p>In short, men are not fully grown unless they have the fundamental idea of being a father. Women are not mature if they want to maintain the state of a bride or if they are mothers but do not fulfill their duties as wives. A wife is a partner of a real father.</p>
<p>The family is the foundation of the national society, so we must establish a formal family. If people find children annoying and try to avoid them, people who grow up like this will find marriage annoying. Life is not just about pursuing happiness. If we want to be happy, we must seek happiness instead of joy. A happy person is often tolerant of others and strict with himself.</p>
<p>If we plan to start marriage well, we must change those people's views and prices of marriage. Young men should not think: who is the most beautiful one; young women should not think: who can always treat me like a bride forever.</p>
<p>The proper life question is: is she the best mother I have chosen for my children? Is he the best father? Or think like this: would I like to be her or his child? (Translated from Reader's Digest)</p>

<h3>Women's Outlets</h3>
<p>— Li Ying</p>
<p>When every girl reaches a certain age and her studies at school have reached a certain stage, she naturally considers her future: getting married? Or seeking employment? Getting married is certainly not a matter of overnight, especially in modern times, it requires a long period of consideration. So she takes a job, partly as a transition to marriage and partly to be economically independent.</p>
<p>They have been irrigated with new culture in schools, and they have the inherent pride of young people, thinking that they are great, full of talk about equality between men and women, serving society, and being a woman of the times; however, as soon as they leave school, how long does it take for them to change their original intentions. Of course, the feudal poison of thousands of years still remains in modern society, but most girls, when they first enter society, cannot resist the temptation of external materials, and with a single mistake, they fall into ruin, and many are corrupted by excessive admiration for vanity.</p>
<p>Many professional women have strong wills and continue to work hard at their posts, day after day, year after year. Seeing the younger sisters getting married one by one, while she is still busy and running around all day long, suddenly, a wave of sadness strikes her. It is not sadness for the loneliness of being single, nor is it the trouble of her job, but the embarrassment of old age. When she can no longer work, how will an old maid live? Of course, she needs a home, and home is getting married. Rather than waiting until the year of "getting married," it is better to take advantage of youth. As a result, they got married!</p>
<p>I object to "women returning to the kitchen" and "getting married is the best career for women," because the former is a means of exhausting soldiers and oppressing women, and the latter is exactly an excuse for the brainy and fat-bellied to humiliate women. However, women must understand how to manage housework, which is their natural responsibility. In the United States and Japan, there are "bride schools," which shows the importance of women to the family. Getting married is not a humble job that relies on men. On the contrary, it is a most sacred job: being a virtuous wife, helping her husband seek career development, and being a good mother, teaching and raising children, please evolve humanity. Moreover, if women are all single and independent, will the world not become extinct and destroyed?</p>
<p>A small number of girls have good family environments, smart qualifications, and more progressive aspirations. They may as well go to middle school, university, or even gilding for further study, and seek genuine independence and serve society in the future. However, they must absolutely abandon selfish enjoyment. If you give up halfway, get married, and have children, the trivial matters of the family and the entanglement of the children will keep you from having a moment of rest, unless you are inhuman.</p>
<p>Finally, let me end my clumsy writing by borrowing the opinion of Mrs. Roosevelt, the former president of the United States: "It should be determined according to the circumstances of the environment, without judgment, and without a fixed path to seek."</p>

<h3>Crab Meat Balls</h3>
<p>— Yihe</p>
<p>The season is autumn again, and "Mr. Wuyang" (crab) is loved by everyone. Here, I would like to introduce a method of eating crab. Housewives may wish to try it.</p>
<p>[Ingredients] Four crabs—preferably female; three eggs, one catty of potatoes, a little salt, ginger, scallions, monosodium glutamate, and animal oil.</p>
<p>[Preparation] First, boil the crabs until cooked. Separate the roe and meat, break them into pieces. Then, boil the potatoes until cooked, peel them, mash them, add salt, monosodium glutamate, ginger, scallions, etc., and mix them evenly so that they are not too thin. Also, mix the egg yolks and whites separately. Add the egg whites to the crab meat, and the egg yolks to the crab roe and meat. Then, mix each into the mashed potatoes to make two piles. Take half of the yellow mashed potatoes and half of the white mashed potatoes to make balls, preferably with a few shrimp kernels on top. Fry the balls in a frying pan, take them out and let them cool slightly, then you can eat them. The taste is incomparably delicious. However, the taste will be lost if eaten cold, so it is advisable to serve it on the table as soon as it comes out of the pot.</p>
<h3>Is Playing Mahjong a Democratic Entertainment in China?</h3>
<p>— Fang Qi</p>
<p>The most favorite pastime for ordinary housewives in Shanghai is playing mahjong.</p>
<p>I have secretly investigated the daily lives of dozens of housewives, and the result is that most of them like to play mahjong, but the degree of liking is different. This result surprised me quite a bit. Why do they like to play mahjong? The biggest reason is that they can make a living and don't have to worry about the seven daily necessities, nor do they have to go out to run for a living. Their husbands earn the money, so they don't have to worry about it themselves. Someone takes care of everything at home: the babysitter cooks and washes clothes, and the nanny takes care of the children. They are almost all idle and have nothing to do. They don't want to sit idle, and they don't have a proper hobby, so they think of playing mahjong to pass the time! And playing mahjong is not limited to uneducated housewives, it seems to be a common epidemic.</p>
<p>Playing mahjong is also like an addiction. Once you get used to it, you have to play it every day. So;</p>
<p>First, it wastes life and money. Mahjong always has wins and losses, and money is always lost. And playing eight rounds or sixteen rounds, or even until late at night, sleeping during the day and playing mahjong at night, is really very exhausting.</p>
<p>Second, couples may often quarrel or fight because of mahjong, which can cause cracks in their relationship.</p>
<p>Third, sometimes friends may argue because of a card. Even if they don't argue, everyone is unhappy in their hearts.</p>
<p>These are still minor matters. The biggest harm is the impact on children;</p>
<p>(1) It cultivates abnormal psychology in children. Most housewives who love to play mahjong base their happiness or unhappiness for the day on whether they win or lose money that day. So they are capricious. If they lose money, they will often beat and scold their children for minor or no reason. This cultivates an abnormal psychology in children of being afraid of their mothers and not daring to speak or move, which prevents them from fully developing themselves and hinders their future.</p>
<p>(2) Children need their parents to pay attention to them at all times. As long as they are not careful for a moment, they will do anything, and once they do it, they will often do it. If a mother likes to play mahjong, she will rarely take care of her children, so children often develop many bad habits, and the family doesn't even know.</p>
<p>(3) Children are most likely to imitate. If parents have a gambling habit, children will play mahjong very young because they are influenced by what they see and hear.</p>
<p>(4) In order to keep the game quiet, parents do not hesitate to provide money to children to make them go away to buy food and play, which results in cultivating children's habit of spending money extravagantly.</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope that ordinary housewives, even if not for themselves, should change their ways and no longer be addicted to mahjong for the sake of their children, the masters of the next generation of the country.</p>
<h3>The Crying of Children</h3>
<p>— Dehua</p>
<p>Raising children is the most troublesome thing, because their vocal organs are not yet fully developed. So when they are uncomfortable or unhappy, they cannot express it in words. Most of them express their unhappiness with the expressions of their muscles and faces, and often cry loudly. However, it is not easy for mothers to know the reason for their crying, and it is very difficult to deal with. Now, children's psychologists have used their experiments and experiences to study the relationship between children's crying and their discomfort, which can be roughly divided into two stages. Fortunately, mothers should pay more attention:</p>
<p>(1) The crying of children under six months of age:</p>
<p>1. Crying loudly and forcefully—indicates discomfort and needs to be massaged.</p>
<p>2. Crying sadly without tears—this is a sign of hunger.</p>
<p>3. Crying intermittently with the legs contracted forcefully—this is probably a stomachache.</p>
<p>4. Yawning while crying—indicates tiredness and wanting to sleep.</p>
<p>5. Crying loudly and forcefully with the head moving left and right—indicates a headache or earache.</p>
<p>(2) The crying of one-year-old children:</p>
<p>1. Crying with a red face and tears—indicates pain in the head and face.</p>
<p>2. Crying with the eyes open and tears, but not loudly—this indicates that the way they are being held is not good.</p>
<p>3. Crying with the eyes half-open, tears, and babbling—this indicates that they are lying uncomfortably, or the bedding is uneven.</p>
<p>4. Crying with the eyes half-open and few tears, with a long tone—this indicates hunger or thirst.</p>
<p>5. Crying suddenly with a frown, shivering all over, and crying loudly—indicates being frightened.</p>
<p>6. Crying loudly with the legs contracted tightly—indicates a stomachache.</p>
<p>7. Crying intermittently with the eyes open, no tears, and the head turning left and right—indicates impatience.</p>

<h3>On Diaries</h3>
<p>— Xi Xi</p>
<p>Diaries are the most direct and reliable documents, but sometimes one is driven by the subconscious to write things without realizing it. If one blindly believes in what is written in one's own hand, one cannot avoid being misled. Not only diaries, but also autobiographies, memoirs, and the like are prone to this problem. In modern times, the diaries of the famous Li Yueman and Weng Wengong were both printed from their handwriting. Seeing the precision and order with which they conducted their studies and affairs, and the richness of the recorded content, one cannot help but sigh in admiration. However, a very surprising loophole can be found in these two diaries.</p>
<p>The last few volumes of Yueman's diary were never handed over by Fan Zengxiang, so the photocopy only goes up to volume fifty-one. From his own Chou year to the year of his death—the winter of Jiawu—there were still some essays and discussions. His death in the winter of Jiawu is mentioned in the biography written by Ping Buqing. When asked, older people also remember it that way, while Weng Wengong's diary suddenly records a line on a certain day in the year of Yiwei, saying that he visited Li Chunju, a famous scholar. At this time, Li should have already passed away. If it is said to be a writing error, then the tone does indeed refer to seeing Li. If it is said that there is an error in the year and month, then the diary is written day by day, how could it be wrong? Moreover, Li was Weng's Gengchen student and was highly regarded at the time. Weng should not have mentioned nothing about Li's passing. This is a doubtful case that cannot be clarified. It is a pity that the last few volumes of Li's diary cannot be published for comparison.</p>
<p>Li Yueman's learning and writing became even more refined in his later years, completely without any fiery temper. He did not keep drafts of some of his poems and lyrics, nor did he write them in his diary. I once saw a small painting, a misty rain pavilion boating scene painted by Tao Fangqi. This was a handwritten record of a trip to Jiaxing in the fourth month of Guiwei year when Tao and Fan Zengxiang visited Xu Jingcheng together. In the Jue year, Fan went to Beijing, and Yueman wrote a passage at the end:</p>
<p>"For ten years, I have slept by Yuan Lake for six evenings, and the beautiful scenery is not easily copied in my life. Five times the sails have leaned against the night fire, and the chess pavilion has become desolate again. The Zhongxing is gradually restoring thousands of families, and the long-term guest emptily misses a single oar. It is rare that an old friend carries a copy of the painting, and I see an ice pot in the soft red dust.</p>
<p>Brocade robes and green feathers resemble flying immortals, and the two beauties ride the lower boat together. The city walls and mountain light divide the green fields, and the shadows of the seagull waves connect the distant sky. The inscription on the collar proves the West Lake moon, and the flying birds soar high above the Shangjun smoke. How can Kuaiji be borrowed to order, to plant flowers and grow old together by the side of the five clouds. Old Brother Yunmen asked me to inscribe on the misty rain chess boating picture. I have been to this lake six times from Jiwei year to Xinwei year, only in Yichou year did I not because I was nursing a child, the rest were all at night and I never boarded the pavilion. In Jiwei, it was late spring, the misty trees were faintly visible, and the pavilions were like paintings; after Yichou, only broken bricks and tiles remained in the wilderness. Now, when I unfold this scroll, it is still a beautiful rainbow, a mirror oar, and floating duckweed. My homesickness and worldly eyes increase my desire to return home, and Yunmen is about to govern Dingyang, and I also have a trip to Tianjin. We bid farewell at the fork in the road, and I hastily composed two poems. When will we ask about the egrets and revisit the old journey? Jia Shen, Spring Festival, Yueman, the old man."</p>
<p>Tao was observing mourning leave after serving as a Hunan provincial education commissioner, and Xu was also at home after his mission abroad. Fan was returning to Beijing that year to take up a new position, so he was able to meet with Yueman. At this time, there was the Vietnam issue, but the poem only speaks of singing about the wind and moon, and it cannot reflect the significance of the times. Tao soon died of illness, and Yueman mourned him the most. Xu was killed in the Gengzi Incident, which he did not live to see. The poem is not included in his collected works, nor is it found in his diary, but it is still a good poem.</p>
<p>This anecdote came to mind when discussing diaries.</p>
<h3>The Napoleon of Literature Balzac</h3>
<p>— Ma Chaoying</p>
<p>Honoré de Balzac was a French novelist, a transitional writer between Romanticism and Realism. His writing method was realistic and scientific. When he came into contact with a person, a place, a thing, or a scene, his eyes, his ears, and all his senses immediately became active, observing and analyzing. At the same time, he had a very rich imagination, which allowed every character and scene he wanted to write about to appear vividly before his eyes. As long as it could be the subject matter for his novels, no matter how vulgar or ugly, he dared to adopt it boldly. Therefore, he was a bold and adventurous writer of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Balzac was born on May 20, 1799, in Tours, France. His father was a lawyer. Balzac was the eldest son in his family, with one younger brother and two younger sisters.</p>
<p>In his early years, Balzac studied at a church school in Vendôme. He was a mediocre student in class, but at the age of thirteen, he became interested in literary masterpieces and immersed himself in reading all day long. He read books without restraint, which affected his health. So he rested at home for a long time.</p>
<p>In 1813, Balzac's family moved to Paris, and he also came to Paris to complete the legal education that his father had assigned to him. After leaving school, he continued to practice under a lawyer for a year and a half, and then worked as an assistant to a registrar for another year and a half. But Balzac soon expressed opposition to his profession, and he was determined to become a writer. At that time, a big mess arose in his family because of this idea, but these difficulties were finally overcome by Balzac's persistence. His family allowed him to try for two years.</p>
<p>At this time, Balzac's family had already left Paris, and only he still lived in a dilapidated house in Paris. His family only gave him a small allowance each year, so little that it was barely enough to maintain his life. But he was not discouraged by this. On the contrary, he dealt with his poverty with an optimistic and humorous attitude. In his small room, he worked hard to write a tragedy about Cromwell, but it was not successful. But he was still not disappointed in himself. He believed that as long as he continued to work hard, he would succeed one day.</p>
<p>In 1825, in order to make money, Balzac and a few friends organized a bookstore and a printing house, but these businesses soon failed. From this time on, Balzac fell into a difficult situation, and he had to write articles to earn money.</p>
<p>Balzac's persistence in writing was astonishing. He usually went to bed around six o'clock in the evening, got up at twelve or one o'clock in the middle of the night, and wrote for seventeen or eighteen hours, sometimes even exceptionally for twenty-five hours without rest. To support this long-lasting excitement, he always drank a lot of strong coffee; this habit became the main cause of his death.</p>
<p>From 1829, Balzac began to occupy an important position in the French literary world at that time. By 1835, his reputation was already very high. The period after 1840 was the time of his greatest fame.</p>
<p>On March 14, 1850, Balzac finished his life and died in Paris. At that time, he had only been married to Madame Hanska, whom he had been pursuing for fifteen years, for a few months!</p>
<p>Balzac's works, in his own ordered complete works, are more than ninety volumes. He gave it a general title called "The Human Comedy" La Comedie Humaine, which includes six groups of "Scenes of Life" Soenesde la vie and two groups of "Studies" Etude. The scope of his writing is very wide, and the descriptions are meticulous and detailed. From his works, we can see the entire French society during the "Restoration of the Monarchy" and the "July Monarchy." The profiteers, usurers, speculators, agents of large banks, diplomats, ministers, merchants, farmers, monks, officials, criminals, police, etc. of that era are all vividly portrayed. His faithful depiction of the contemporary French society was truly a deviation from the romantic school of the time. Balzac often called himself the "Napoleon of Literature" during his lifetime. Indeed, his writing ambition was no less than Napoleon's courage in facing the enemy.</p>
<h3>Seed</h3>
<p>— Zhang Baihuai</p>
<p>Once, in a dream, I discovered a seed on a barren wasteland. I didn't know what kind of seed it was, but the dryness and barrenness of this wasteland seemed to suddenly make me realize a question I had pondered for a long time.</p>
<p>This is my own question.</p>
<p>The seed of my hope is indeed falling on barren wasteland. To tell the truth, I am a young man who has not received a good education. Although I am not stupid, I never waste time, and my small works are also praised by people; however, if I were to say that I am a seed, then I am thinking, now is spring, even if it sprouts and sticks out above the soil, joyfully accepting the nourishment of rain and dew and sunshine, but after a few days, the water absorbed from the strata will not feel enough, and the outstretched leaves will also turn yellow. If it goes on like this, even though spring is still soaring in the sky, my branches and leaves will have already withered. I almost believe that this metaphor will become a prophecy.</p>
<p>In order to struggle, I have to pay attention to the health of my seed. A healthy seed grows into a strong tree, and only a strong tree can withstand storms on barren and dry soil, and finally bear its beautiful fruit.</p>
<p>Health is undoubtedly the foundation of future happiness.</p>
<p>How can I be healthy?</p>
<p>I am contradictory, my actions and thoughts are often inconsistent; I am fragile, my emotions and reason are often unbalanced; I am dreamy, reality and ideals often make me suffer; I am such as I am, that is, of course, only the abstract me, but it can also be seen how unhealthy and on what a shallow foundation I am.</p>
<p>I first went to inquire about the meaning of health.</p>
<p>"The meaning of health is the completeness of human nature," this is one person's answer: "The complete expression of a person's spirit, virtue, and thought."</p>
<p>"Then it can be said that there are too few healthy people," I said.</p>
<p>"Most of the people in this world have no character, almost all people are without character, evil, immoral. This is not my original saying, a great Russian artist who fought tragically all his life said so. That's not enough, people still affirm themselves, happy, as if they were complete people! That's the most hateful thing!"</p>
<p>I still cannot understand the image of a healthy person.</p>
<p>"Its best explanation is a person's appearance, its best symbol is a person's wisdom," this is another person explaining: "A healthy person has a healthy smile, which is different from the evil and licentious smile you see; a healthy person has a healthy cry, he will not wail in sorrow and lose the power of revenge. A healthy person, when we look at him from afar, is dignified and great; when we are close to him, he is gentle and kind. What angers him is when you go against your conscience, what pleases him is when you fulfill one of your hopes. A healthy person is impartial, does not make unnecessary worries and hesitations; he also dreams, but never indulges in dreams, he also suffers, but suffering cannot overwhelm him. A healthy person, his wisdom is like light, the flashing of light can illuminate the darkness; like a flower, the flower blooms in the dense garden of life, emitting a rich fragrance, so that all people can be close to its fragrance."</p>
<p>I think it is difficult to become a healthy person.</p>
<p>"Then," I asked, "what is the foundation of health?"</p>
<p>"The foundation of health is laid by oneself," this is the answer: "Take advantage of every opportunity, don't relax yourself even one step."</p>
<p>"That's really too hard to do."</p>
<p>"That's not hard to do," this is what he said: "Good and bad are changing. Gide said: "If man has not always been like this, how can it be said that man will always be like this? Man is changing! Believe him."</p>
<p>I didn't ask any more questions, and I also remembered what he said about "new food." I found that book in infinite joy.</p>
<p>"Not only does the world change," A. Gide said, "but so does man. Where will it appear from? That new person? Not from the outside, comrade, try to find him in yourself, and, like extracting pure metal without slag from a gold mine, draw him out of yourself, that long-awaited person, obtain him from yourself. Dare to become what you will be. Don't easily let go of yourself, every creature has all kinds of admirable possibilities. Believe in your own strength - your own youth, know to constantly say to yourself: "It's all in me!"</p>
<p>It's all in my health! A seed on a barren wasteland has already grown on barren soil, and I believe I can also withstand storms, blossom and bear fruit, and let people taste very beautiful and very sweet fruits of happiness. (One of the broken and incomplete manuscripts)</p>

<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 63</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Because the car was unreliable, we had to wait for the train again, but it was limited to one hour. If the train didn't leave again, we planned to hire a car again, going as far as we could, and then walk, anyway, it was only forty-some miles. Less than half an hour later, we suddenly heard a sudden commotion outside the dining hall. Looking through the window, it turned out that tickets were already being sold, and there were more people. Later, I learned that the station, although it had a sign, was just for advertising purposes. It would only sell tickets and start the train when there were enough people. Moreover, if the train couldn't pass and encountered a conflict, it might stop for half a day, or it might return the tickets.</p>
<p>When we got on the train, in the military, we were very careful to look for that woman, but we didn't see her踪影. We also expected that there must be other people of this kind on the train, and things of this kind. I had already told my younger brother Hu in advance that there was no need to escape. Since the Northeast fell, there have been many small detectives and informers of this kind along the way. This is a common practice for the Japanese; therefore, every pedestrian must encounter a lot of trouble. Sometimes they come soft, sometimes they come hard, and they must find out your whereabouts, what you do, and who you are before they are relieved.</p>
<p>Sure enough, before long, a middle-aged man sitting opposite us, in his teens, dressed as a merchant, suddenly yawned, stretched his legs, and kicked my younger brother Hu. My younger brother Hu glared at him and was about to explode. I saw that the fellow quickly bent down and stroked my younger brother Hu a few times, apologizing repeatedly. He took this opportunity to talk to my younger brother Hu, asking this and that. My younger brother Hu knew that this was another trick like the country woman's, and he didn't need to pretend. He just used his natural childish and mischievous energy, scolding and insulting him with anger. The fellow, after receiving this scolding, although he was smiling reluctantly, was really a little red in the face with anger. Looking at the way he looked, it seemed that he still wanted to seize the opportunity to retaliate.</p>
<p>At this time, I suddenly felt a burst of uneasiness, and I was also a little regretful. What was the reason? Because, after a cold observation, only my actions and those of my younger brother Hu in this section of the car made people feel out of place. First, looking at the tea boy on the train, when he served tea and water, he was so kind to everyone, as if they were all acquaintances, but he had a dead look in his eyes towards us. Second, everyone on the train, regardless of men, women, old or young, were talking to each other, chatting about everyday life, but we didn't talk to anyone; this showed that we were a different kind of people, appearing isolated. Also, this Pingtong line is just a short branch line, and people who come and go often, I think, are probably these people, and their faces are all familiar; we, in the eyes of those people, are probably a little strange. To call us, on this road, the running dogs and special agents of the Japanese or traitors, of course, they will pay special attention to people like us. What do I regret? Originally, before setting off, the team leader Mu Lai had advised us to change our clothes and stay with the country people along the way. As a cover, or use the department's car to send us there. But we didn't want to trouble the department, and we were young and energetic, and we didn't take these gangs of traitors seriously. More importantly, although we are said to be young, we are "upright soldiers" appointed by the state, why should we be so sneaky and disguised? But I didn't know that this move was a bit too arrogant. Why? People who are doing special work should try to avoid all unexpected troubles as much as possible; because our work has a goal, and if we cause trouble because of arrogance, there is nothing else, but if we cause an accident because of this, wouldn't it be a dereliction of duty and a mistake?</p>

<h3>Squeezing Oil</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>A few days ago, I wrote an article "White Collar Criminals," which was based on the news that the security authorities in Fuzhou punished those who watched free shows and rode free cars. I said that the method was very humorous, although it was joking and abusive, but the intention was quite profound. The next day, I received a letter from an armed comrade, who had the following opinions on this issue:</p>
<p>"...(Omitted above) The problem of riding free cars in Shanghai did not start today. It has been popular long before the war and during the enemy puppet period. The whole knot lies with the country and the competent authorities, not because a person is willing to disregard shame and squeeze oil to ride free cars, suffering discrimination and secret laughter. It is really because the treatment of national soldiers and general junior civil servants is too low. To give an example, a civil servant cannot reimburse travel expenses for official business unless there are special circumstances, and the twists and turns are especially numerous, with too many cumbersome procedures such as proving, responsible supervisor approval, and responsible personnel. Therefore, there are general military officers above the rank of lieutenant, who all squeeze oil to ride free cars. Junior soldiers and civil servants have no money to ride in cars, so they can only follow suit and squeeze oil. (Omitted in the middle) In summary, watching free shows and cracking down on theater owners has resulted in repeated detentions and punishments of the perpetrators to warn others, but the number of people watching free shows has not decreased from the past. Although there is a free invitation to national troops at noon every Saturday, the date and time are not appropriate. The theater, for the sake of business, does not give them spare time to entertain themselves, resulting in the inability to completely eliminate watching free shows. Only those who watch free shows and squeeze oil should be punished, but those who ride free cars for official business and for their livelihood should be forgiven with a loud voice." I am willing to publish this publicly here, and I would like to ask everyone to study it.</p>

<h3>Jewish Terrorist Organizations</h3>
<p>— Wenzhen</p>
<p>When the flames of democracy and independence are burning in every corner of Asia, the descendants of Israel, who have been wandering for nearly two thousand years, must also feel the pain of drifting and prepare for a national revival movement! That's right, this movement is unfolding vigorously after World War II. Every day, on the foreign news pages, there are reports about their national revival movement, such as immigration to Palestine, conflicts between the Jewish and Arab peoples, and disagreements between the British and American governments due to different views on this movement.</p>
<p>There are two major factions leading the Jewish national revival movement. One faction is the radical faction, which is the terrorist organization mentioned here, and the other is the moderate faction, to which the so-called Zionism belongs. (Zion is the name of a mountain in Jerusalem). Zionism is not within the scope of this article, and will be recorded in another article later. What can be predicted is that the latter advocates using legal, democratic, political and diplomatic means to achieve the goal of national revival. As for the radical faction, they want to directly expel the British from the country by force and organize a free and independent Jewish homeland.</p>
<p>On November 6, 1944, Sir Lord Moyne, the British Minister of State in the Middle East, was assassinated in the forest of his villa in Cairo by two young Jews. One of the murderers was twenty-seven years old, and the other was only twenty years old. As a result, they were sentenced to be hanged. Before that, after a trial, the two murderers indignantly accused the British of improper measures in Palestine, for which the British warned reporters not to report the details of the trial. But later the news finally leaked out, and the murderers finally achieved their expected goal—shifting the world's attention to Palestine!</p>
<p>These two murderers belonged to the Stern Gang in the Jewish terrorist organization. There are two branches of Jewish terrorist organizations, and the Stern Gang is the smaller but most radical branch.</p>
<p>When the Stern Gang was formed is not very clear now. What is known is that it was founded by a Polish Jew named Stern. The members of the group are all called "Free Israeli Fighters" and specialize in individual assassinations. Its masterpieces include the murder of Inspector General Wilkim, Senior Commissioner Sir Michael, and the aforementioned Dr. Moyne.</p>
<p>Stern was a resolute, fanatical poet who was killed in 1942 in the area of ​​the Arabian Peninsula, Dan Amuw. He was less than thirty-five years old when he died. His assassination team consisted of fifty assassins and one hundred and fifty assistants (such as intelligence officers, propagandists, etc.). After Stern's death, his deputy, nicknamed "Fanatical Red Eyes," Yellin, took over.</p>
<p>As for the other branch of the terrorist organization, it is the National Military Organization, usually referred to as NMO, which are the first three letters of the group's name. MNO is led by a skinny law student Picken. He is good at guerrilla warfare, strikes, and creating terror. This organization's weapon is bombs. They often collectively attack the British government's administrative agencies, police, tax collectors, and even the British army in Palestine. The scale and strength of the MON are stronger than those of the Stern Gang. Most of the members are Jewish special agents from the past Polish army. From 1941 to 1942, the team withdrew from the Soviet Union to Central Asia, and many of its members joined the NMO. They provided intelligence, used Polish military cards to transport food and ammunition, and used camps to hide murderers. On July 22 of this year, the world-shaking bombing case at the King David Hotel, where the headquarters of the British army in Palestine was located, was the achievement of the NMO.</p>
<p>The Jewish terrorist organization ends here. As for whether their national revival movement infringes on the sovereignty of the Arab nation, that is a topic for politicians and diplomats. Standing in the position of ordinary people, I only feel that the spirit of Jewish youth, who show their generosity and dedication to justice and follow in each other's footsteps for the sake of national revival, is truly worthy of our admiration. Seeing how difficult it is for the Jewish nation to revive their country, and then looking back at our country, which we have worked so hard to win the War of Resistance against Japan and preserve, but is now desperately engaged in civil war, it is really heartbreaking for ordinary people.</p>

<h3>Horse Racing in Gansu</h3>
<p>— You Nan</p>
<p>The Shanghai horse racing issue remains unresolved, and the decision ultimately rests with the municipal government. We will temporarily set that aside and discuss "horse racing" in Gansu.</p>
<p>Every year during the Lunar New Year, on the sixth day of the first month, the Tibetan people of Gansu traditionally hold a horse racing festival. However, their horse racing ceremony and purpose are very different from the horse racing held in the Shanghai concessions during that period.</p>
<p>At that time, the climate was still very cold, and the people were idle. On the appointed day, the Tibetan people dressed in festive attire, and their saddles were decorated with gold, silver, and jewels. Red silk ribbons were tied to the horses' tails, and the manes on their necks and backs were combed into small braids, bound with uniform green silk. The Tibetan people rode their horses, full of joy and pride, and gathered in a designated public square.</p>
<p>At the same time, monks, lamas, men and women, and ordinary people arrived on foot and horseback, creating a crowded and lively scene. After the officials in charge of the horse race arrived, they publicly announced the "Living Buddha's" decree, stating: "Those who participate in the horse race will not be held responsible for any deaths or tramplings. The Buddha's Dharma is boundless, and this is final. If there are any accidental injuries or deaths, it is considered a swift ascent to heaven, and there should be no resentment."</p>
<p>During the horse racing event, five horses were first divided into a group, and each two groups competed once. Then, the top horses from each group were gathered for a final race. The winner was congratulated by the Tibetan people, who hailed him as the "Hero on Horseback" of the year, considering it a great honor. I remember that during the competition in the 25th year of the Republic (1936), the champion was a Tibetan man from Gansu named "Hua Deng Duo Lang," who was only twenty years old.</p>
<p>Horse racing in Gansu is simply a form of athletic competition with a pure purpose, seemingly beyond reproach. Compared to horse racing in major cities around the world, which is aimed at gambling and profit, it is indeed much more noble.</p>
<h3>Odds and Ends</h3>
<p>— w. w.</p>
<p>The unmarried want to marry, the married want to be single, and the divorced want to remarry. Once married, people forget their parents; once they have children, they abandon their parents. Filial sons are still filial sons, but when their sons grow up, they imitate their behavior.</p>
<p>This is called the cycle of life.</p>
<p>The Canadian Ambassador is concerned about our country, saying that he is worried about the export of raw materials in exchange for manufactured goods. If China were still the "center of the world" as in the past, then his heartfelt words would truly reflect his concern for the world before himself.</p>
<p>Looking back at our compatriots, it is painful to realize that they cannot live without foreign goods!</p>
<p>The three daughters of Mr. × went abroad. Not only have they adopted foreign styles, but even their names have been replaced with foreign ones. We, the poor, can only sigh in admiration!</p>
<h3>How Roosevelt Dealt with Stalin (2)</h3>
<p>— Written by Frances Perkins, Translated by Ge Chunliang</p>
<p>"I felt very disappointed. If it were just a matter of official paperwork, why would I travel such a long distance to fulfill the Russian's request? They themselves were unwilling to come to America or anywhere in Europe. Therefore, I had to go to them to make friends with Stalin. I felt very disappointed because I couldn't figure out how to proceed. All we've accomplished are things that diplomats could have done.</p>
<p>"I thought about it all night and decided to do something desperate to survive. I couldn't stay in Tehran forever. I had to break through this cold surface so that I could communicate with him privately by phone or letter afterward. During the meetings, I rarely met with Churchill alone because I had a feeling that the Russians would think it was wrong if Churchill and I were talking about things we knew but they didn't.</p>
<p>"In the morning, when we went to the conference hall, I caught up with Winston (Churchill's name). I only said one sentence to him: 'Winston, I hope you won't be angry about what I'm going to do.'</p>
<p>"Winston flicked the ash off his cigar and grunted. I must say that his behavior afterward was indeed very good.</p>
<p>"Entering the conference hall, I immediately began to act. I talked to Stalin privately. Although everything I said had already been said, my attitude was more cordial and intimate, so that the other Russians joined in to listen, but they never smiled.</p>
<p>"Then, I covered my mouth with one hand and pretended to whisper something, which was immediately translated. I said, 'Churchill is in a bad mood this morning because he woke up and found himself sleeping under the bed.'</p>
<p>"A faint smile appeared in Stalin's eyes. Then, I decided that I was on the right track. Sitting at the conference table, I began to tease Churchill, mocking his English manner, mocking 'John Bull' (the nickname for the English), mocking his cigar, and mocking his habits, gradually eliciting a response from Stalin. Winston turned red and roared. The more he did so, the more Stalin smiled. Finally, Stalin couldn't help but laugh deeply and happily. For the first time in three days, I began to see a glimmer of hope. I continued to tease him until he laughed along with me. At this point, I began to call him 'Uncle Joe.' The day before, he had treated me like a stranger, but on the day he laughed, he walked over and shook my hand tightly.</p>
<p>"From that moment on, our relationship began to become closer. Stalin himself occasionally joined in a joke or two. The ice on the surface was broken, and we talked like ordinary men, like brothers.</p>
<p>"Do you know?" the President continued. "He was deeply moved by the sword that Churchill brought from the British government as a gift. The ornate sword was placed on a red velvet cushion, and Churchill gave one of his most brilliant short speeches. Churchill himself was filled with emotion, explaining how the British people admired Russia's courageous fighting and Stalin's great leadership! (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Remembering Stilwell</h3>
<p>— Sheng Jie</p>
<p>The news of the death of General Stilwell, the famous general who fought in the India-Burma theater, in the United States, brought tears to my eyes!</p>
<p>The general was originally from the United States, but he served in China for twenty years of his life. He was fluent in Chinese, understood Japanese, and was quite familiar with Chinese customs and practices. Therefore, his understanding of China was particularly profound. In 1942, he came to China again from the United States and successively served as Chief of Staff of the China Theater, Commander of the U.S. Forces in the China-India-Burma Theater, and Deputy Commander of the Allied Forces in Southeast Asia. During the India-Burma campaign, he opened up a new supply line to China, connecting the Yunnan-Burma Road. This was the most profound impression he left on the Chinese people. To commemorate General Stilwell's great achievements, this road was also named the "Stilwell Road."</p>
<p>The most interesting story left in the India-Burma theater is a few words from a Chinese soldier about General Stilwell, which became the talk of the town among the Allied officers and soldiers in India and Burma after dinner.</p>
<p>Before his death, General Stilwell was already an old general in his sixties, but he did not show the signs of weakness typical of older people. He was like a young and vigorous young officer. In the India-Burma theater, he often wore a Chinese military cap, carried a submachine gun, and inspected the front lines in the midst of gunfire.</p>
<p>Speaking Chinese</p>
<p>Once, General Stilwell was inspecting the front line when a Chinese soldier saw him and was very worried about the life of this sixty-year-old old soldier. The soldiers said, "This old fellow is really tired of living and deliberately came here to die!"</p>
<p>Who knew that General Stilwell immediately replied in Mandarin: "I am not an old fellow, I am your Chief Commander Stilwell." The soldiers looked at each other in dismay.</p>
<p>Unrelenting Efforts</p>
<p>He was an American commanding a Chinese expeditionary force on British territory, but he must not interfere in Sino-British politics, nor allow Sino-British political relations to hinder his plans. To overcome these many political difficulties, he spared no effort to fly over the 18,000-foot-high Himalayas, mediating between the Allied authorities.</p>
<p>He finally achieved the three goals of the North Burma campaign: (1) opening up a new supply line to China to connect the Yunnan-Burma Road; (2) destroying the main force of the Japanese invaders; and (3) proving that properly trained, armed, and led Chinese armies are no different from the best armies in the world.</p>
<p>Today, Chinese soldiers and Allied comrades have begun to view him in a different light. He is the old man of every soldier in the Allied forces, the head of the army. When he passes by a field hospital for wounded soldiers, he always goes to see the Chinese wounded soldiers and comforts those soldiers in Chinese.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he often sits with Chinese and American soldiers, eating their pickled vegetables, drinking their coffee, and chatting with them casually. General Stilwell's shadow appears everywhere on the jungle paths. When he meets Chinese soldiers with toothy smiles, he always chats with them. This is the key factor in his ability to gain the trust of Chinese soldiers.</p>
<p>Stilwell, a typical democratic American general, will forever live in the glorious history of China's War of Resistance!</p>
