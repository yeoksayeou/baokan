<p>〔中央社徐州九日電〕共軍向蘇北發動大攻勢後，現正積極擴大其進犯地區，陷入共軍包圍之海門，情勢曾任緊，共軍正由四面繼續向海門城猛進。其由　南增調之三個師，已到達淮陰·高郵·東臺一喧，會合該地共軍於六日分向六合，來安急進，共軍第三師當日下午由高郵渡過高郵湖，在菱塘橋登陸，繼續向六合以東猛進。共軍第二師七日已進至來安附近，後續部隊繼續跟進中。集結豐沛碭山永城間地區共軍，約達二萬人，正向碭山進迫，並圖切斷隴海路交通。共軍收編之偽軍郝鵬舉部，亦進至白塔埠沙河鎮等地，正繼續向東海進逼。</p>
<h3>棗陽共軍被擊退　新野陷落宜城情況不明　津南共軍集結漳河北岸</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口九日電〕中原軍區共軍李先念部，連日分股向棗陽猛撲，戰事正激烈進行中。竄至棗陽以北十五公裏之青臺附近共軍，因搶刦糧食，曾遭當地鄉民反抗。</p>
<p>〔中央社鄭州九日電〕共軍「中原軍區」自六月廿九日發動大規模攻勢，迄八日已繼續十日之久，其侵至鄂北之文建武縱隊，王樹聲縱隊各一部，曾猛攻隨陽店棗林店及劉替，企圖奪取棗陽，已被國軍擊退。渡越襄河進犯宣城之共軍王樹聲部，已增援向城　圍攻，現該城情況不明。同時共軍劉伯誠部亦於豫北集結八萬人，發動大規模攻勢，正分賂湯陰武陟溫縣猛烈攻擊中。據此問觀察家稱，李先念劉伯誠兩部於同時向鄂豫各地發動大規模攻勢，顯已揭開其發動全面內亂之序幕。</p>
<p>〔中央社鄭州九日電〕分向豫南鄂北竄擾共軍二萬餘，已有向老河口襄河西岸會竄趨勢，老河口北六十裏之孟家樓，九日晨已發現共軍。李先念之先遣部隊王樹聲部，八日亦已由宜城向茨河穀城方面前竄，李先念指軍之一縱隊，八日一部由棗陽北七十裏郭灘前竄，其一股八日上午攻陷新野，一股竄抵鄧縣南四十裏之構林集，另一部由南陽南七十裏之沙堰前竄，八日下午由范集渡越白河，竄抵鄧縣東六十餘裏之急灘。</p>

<h3>盧漢孫立人等抵潘　戴伯爾門今飛長　佈置杜聿明林彪會晤</h3>
<p>〔本報北平九日電〕目前之潘陽，又將星雲　，盧漢·孫立人兩將軍皆新蒞潘，與杜聿明有所商談，東北機構改組之說，又甚囂塵上。杜聿明與林彪是否能如期會晤，而不展期，尚待事實證明，但此間官方與共方均不重視此會晤，則係事實，惟在若幹地方小問題上，亦可能獲得解決人。聞政府方面已準備在杜林戴會議中，提議共軍勿破壞小縣滿向潘陽　電線路，及釋放長春被俘人員事。戴伯爾門今日尚留此，定明天日飛長春佈置杜林會晤，官方對戴氏來平原因，作極輕松之解釋，謂渠係返平，向執行部美方要衣物食糧補組者。</p>
<p>〔本報潘陽九日電〕近傳哈爾濱共軍有撤退說。經記者向軍政當局探詢結果，均謂對此未獲正式情報，一切靜待事實證明。</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕關於陸軍總司令顧祝同赴東北之任務，記者訪白部長崇禧，承答：顧氏此行為一普通之出巡而已，短期內即可返京。</p>
<h3>平成立防空部　注重訓練民眾</h3>
<p>〔本報北平九日電〕北平防空司令部已於七月一日先行成立，人事猶待佈置，地址將設中南海　臺內。副總司令胡伯翰語記者：舉世各國均有防空司令部之設，中國自不能例外，故司令部為常設性質，該部首要工作注重訓練民眾。</p>
<h3>北平太原間　鐵路已暢通</h3>
<p>〔本報北平九日電〕北平與太原間之鐵路，刻已暢通無阻，平漢正太線各站，已辦理客貨聯運，單幫商人，往來極多，惟各站皆禁運食糧出境。井陘煤除軍運外，不許自由出境。軍調部對恢複平漢交通，尚不能為有效措施，路局方面現已作修路準備，業令各站不重要義道拆除改運，以備石家莊向南修築需要。</p>
<p>〔中央社濟南八日電〕膠濟路西段七日已修復至普集，刻正繼續向東搶修，期早至普集，刻正繼續向東搶修，期早日全線通車，濟南至棗陽寺間交通車，定九日起展駛至明水。</p>
<h3>首都政治空氣仍沉寂　主席召見徐永昌　馬使與陳邵王交換意見</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕聞蔣主席今　曾召見軍事三人會議之政府代表徐永昌將軍，有所指示。</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕政治空氣依然沉寂，　今午　　說今晚有召開三人會議可能，然至午夜止，尚未有此動態。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京九日電〕馬歇爾特使今日會晤王世傑，陳誠，邵力子三人，交換意見，會議結果則未宣布。是為今日首都方面唯一重要會議。</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕因见於中原戰事之調處問題，馬歇爾今日特派專機赴漢口，邀約在漢之執行小組內美方及中共之代表來京，彼等於下午三時抵達，日內即將向馬帥報告，俾馬師於調處時有所依據。</p>
<p>〔中面社南京九日電〕記者自政府負責方面探悉：所謂五人會議雲雲、並無此項組織之規定，令係政府及共產黨雙方代表，臨時交換意見而已，外傳此後商談，即以此固定形式舉行會議說，實係誤傳。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京八日電〕共產黨發言人今日宣稱：局勢異常危急，其原因有二：一為和平談判已完全停頓，二為各地戰事　起，政府方面亦同樣悲觀。周恩來曾與蔣主席及政府代表會議三次，政府堅決拒絕共常要求在共軍撤退區域保留地方政府，毫無妥協希望，因此周氏已入棄與政府直接談判，國民黨發言人則謂，此項僵局自六月初即已存在，雖經種種努力，迄未能將其打開。</p>
<h3>羅隆基訪馬使</h3>
<p>民盟將在滬開會議</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕民主同盟代表羅隆基於今晨十一時許訪晤馬歇爾特使，對五人會談未決之政治問題，有所商談，並交換打開目前僵局之意見，談約一小時許　出，羅今晚十時乘夜車赴滬。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：民主同盟有在滬舉行會議說。羅隆基已定昨晚乘夜車由京來滬，留滬民盟黃炎培，章伯鈞，沈鈞儒等，一俟在京之代表羅隆基，張申府，梁　溟等到滬後，即開始會商。屆時，對國共問題將集議草擬一折衷解決方案，提供雙方。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京九日電〕民盟出席政協會議代表明日將在上海開會，聽取民盟發言人羅隆基報告目前局勢，以故政治僵局又極有打開希望。據羅氏據：今晨曾要求會見馬使，俾得聆取最佳消息。余將赴滬　告當前局勢後，再商討民盟是否可以提出一雙方滿意之建議，　使和平談判得以重開。本人認為打開人僵屍之唯一辦法，厥為恢復軍事三人小組會議，馬使可於會議時以必要壓力施諸雙方，國　談判未獲成功，民盟殊感失望。政府既已拒絕召開政協會議之綜合小組會議，討論政治問題，則由馬使主席，重開軍事三人小組會議，殆為起向和平之唯一途徑。民盟對召開國民大會並不反對，但由單方面決定會期，則堅決反對。</p>
<h3>下關受傷記者　獲藥賠償費</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京九日電〕下關事件中受傷之南京新聞記者四人，今日獲得中宣部現款賠償，計大剛報高集及新民報浦熙修，各得三十五萬元，大中報徐土年得十萬元。據中宣部宣稱，賠款係補助醫藥費及個人物件衣衫損失之用。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾接見曾琦　商當前時局問題　馬氏表示決續為我和平而努力</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕五人會談無形停頓後，熟望中國和平統一之馬歇爾特使至感焦灼。今日上午十時，馬使曾於官邸接見青年黨主席曾琦，以不盡不休之精神，為中國和平努力，表示無上之謝意，對於美政府所持積級援華之政策，表示敬佩，並以舉國公認之謝意，對於美政府所持積極援華之政策，表示敬佩，並以舉國公認之第三者中立之立場，向馬使致慰，希望馬使勿因當前局勢之困難而稍灰心。馬使聽取曾氏意見後，曾以墾摯謙遜之語氣答謝曾氏，並謂，美國全國人民無問朝野，莫不以最大之熱誠，盼望中國和平團結統一，成為一富強康樂之國家渠個人更樂望中國和平而不斷努力。聞馬曾會談約達一小時。馬使曾詢問青年黨政策甚詳，曾氏當告以青年黨之立場，乃國共以外，始於保持獨立與中立之第三大黨，代有小資產階級，亦即謂中層社會之人民，而青年黨所表現之特性，乃為（一）獨立性，（二）中和性，（三）建設性，馬周談話歷一小時。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京八日電〕首都黨員黨政革新運動座談會，八日下午首次集會，約請京市各區黨部負責人參加。到梁寒操，余井塘等二百餘人，賀衷寒主席。首由梁寒操報告發動黨政革新運動　過，並分述其動　與意義，渠強調必須發揮：（一）團結革命同志實行黨內民主；（二）打倒官僚資本，實行民生主議；（三）肅清官官僚主義，實行民主政治；（四）發揚民族正氣，保衛國家主權等　種基本精神，始足以言從事革新運動。最後希望此次運動將來擴及各當刮目省各縣市，使到處皆有討論研究之空氣，與要求革新之呼聲，俾促成一革新之大變動。詞畢，京市各區黨部負責人，對加強黨的組織，實行黨員總清查，健全區黨　等問題，發表　見甚多，最後決定請各區黨部負責人於短期內，發動各單位舉行座談會，並定隔兩週後之星期一，舉行第二次座談會，綜合各區黨部同志意見，再加研討。</p>
<h3>美海長昨飛京　專誠晤宋院長</h3>
<p>當晚來滬即返美國</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕美海長福萊斯特爾於離京飛平後，原擬即飛滬返美。茲因福氏以未能與宋院長會晤意圖，故今日特自平飛京，於下午二時半抵京，與宋院長會晤，暢談至四時半，逕飛滬。即由宋院長親自送至機場，福氏即乘機飛滬轉返美國。</p>
<h3>蘇聯反對美援華　意在不顧我強大</h3>
<p>紐約時報記者之分析</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約九日電〕紐約時報駐莫斯科通訊員密得爾頓報告，一週以來，莫斯科報界激烈反對美國干涉中國事件，如真理報甚至指責美國違反不干涉中國內政，莫斯科協定，謂此析蘇聯持此種態度之理由，謂此種攻擊，乃由於蘇聯於東方強國日本在第二次世界大戰崩潰後，以為蘇聯遠東之發展及計劃，從此可以無阻，並希望不可再有另外強國代起，而為蘇聯之敵，故吾人慶以此種眼光觀察，蘇聯責備美軍事援華也。渠並指示蘇聯世界政策中之對華部分，謂雖然蘇聯於戰後　於最強國之列，但自戰爭結束後，種種形勢之發展，在在使其所期待之蘇聯擴張時期之希望，趨於微弱，此種形勢發展之一，為美國繼續援華，蘇報評論表示，中國以其巨大人力及「反動」政府可能變為軍事發展之域，以干涉蘇聯於西伯利亞內地及濱海地方之計劃。蘇聯以為自日本壓力消失後，蘇聯應有權在東西兩面，從似所欲，初不欲美國援助一唯一可為蘇聯匹敵之亞洲致府也。此種意義，於各報評論中，甚為明顯。</p>

<p>〔本報南京九日電〕蔣主席於今日下午四時，在官邸接見昨日下午抵京之中美農業技術合作代表團赫契生，郝默爾，白凱，麥宜爾，艾　茜小姐，柯籲，葛軾，謝志，沈宗瀚，葉謙吉，運萬森，楊懋春，林剛，吳晋淸，馬保之等一行十八人，由農林部長周貽春陪同前往。該團美籍代表三人，於今日上午十二時三十五分曾拜謁馬歇爾特使，九十兩日將集體拜候中央各院部長，十一日起開始討論有關農業之教育硏究，推廣金融各議題，預定十九日參觀金陵大學中央大學農學院及其附設農場。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京九日電〕中美農業技術合作團今日由蔣主席予以接見，招待茶會。據美國各專家談稱：主席極其慇懃，對於本團計劃，深爲關切，並垂詢各項問題。</p>
<p>〔又電〕中美農業技術合作團，今日開始硏究，希望能擬具一種計劃，使中國民食無憂，同時恢復其主要農產品之輸出，藉以供給外匯，維持國家經濟。團員二十人，十人係美國農業專家，由美政府選派，十人爲中國農業及貿易人材，由政府遴選。各團負擬赴瀋陽及北滿，並望中共領袖與之合作，俾赴共軍「解放區」內，調查其農業狀况。該團除考察中國農業技術之落後，診斷其病狀，以謀增加生產，提高品質外，並將擬具計劃，以改善中國桐油，絲，茶，地曁及漁業，並增加其產量。代表團將分爲五隊，每隊中至少有美國專家一人，曾同中國團員，詳細考察其產銷方法，該團將注重中國出口貨之品質，並使其標準化。過去中國及其他東方國家之出口貨缺乏標準，今批裝出之貨，品質殊不一律，以致推銷方面大爲困難，農業團主要問題之一，即在建議一種辦法，使紐约或倫教方面向中國採購桐油地氈者，可確知其听購貨物之品質如何。一俟考察完畢，將在南京或上海重行集合，準備提出建議。</p>
<h3>法經濟代表團　談中法貿易關係　將與我討論促進之方</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社南京九日電〕法國駐遠東經濟代表團團長亨利莫氏，來京公幹，本日發表談話稱。法國駐遠東經濟代表團之目的，乃欲促成中法兩國間技術，工業及貿易關係之發展。法國歷來對華出口，以工業設備及化學品爲大宗，同時自中國輸入生絲，茶葉及其他特別製造品，如電燈泡及法國工業上必需之稀有礦物之類。越南對華出口，以食米煤斤及橡膠爲主，越南治安恢復後，食米有恢復出口可能，法國交通鋼業已恢復，重工業亦已活動，故法國可能恢復其在世界市塲之地位。目前對華貿易關係，受中國高物價之阻碍，日後本人與中國當局舉行談判時，此點即將爲討論項目之一。余可斷言，至本年九月時，法國輪船可在上海海防及西貢間恢復行駛，屆時中國與越南之貿易，將大爲發展。此外，余望關於法國航空綫通過中國一項問題，亦能成立協定，但兩國間恢復正常航空交通，尙無確定日期之可能。</p>

<h3>政院工程計劃團建議　興建三大公路綫　全部經費逾三億美金</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：我國戰後公路之建設，由於復員經費之限制，以及國內局勢之動盪不定，目前之階段，仍將側重於保養工作，至於新的公路，暫行決定興建三綫：（一）自上海經南京，漢口至重慶，（二）自西安至漢口，（三）自北平至塘沽。此三綫公路之興建，係由行政院工程計劃團所建議，業經公路總局採納，並派員分批出發各段，從事勘察及測繪工作。三綫公路均屬甲等標準國道，路面寬度擬定爲六公尺至七公尺，路基寬度擬定九公尺至十二公尺。路面擬鋪以水泥，倘水泥產量不敷，則改用柏汪路面或瀝青路面。三綫原有之舊路，毁壞程度太大，坡度亦距標準太遠，是以新路之興建，將不利用舊路，全部另闢路綫。惟此項工程至鉅預計經費需美金三三七，三九五，二五〇元。工程之正式展開，胥視美國之貸款而決定。</p>

<h3>溥逆儀罪同汪陣　決不能視作戰犯</h3>
<p>首都高院趙院長談話</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕「傀儡皇帝」溥儀，勝利後爲蘇捕獲，拘禁於伯力，經我政府數度交涉後，蘇已允引渡我國，近有押解來京，以戰犯罪受審之說。今日記者晤首都高等法院趙琛院長，叩詢此事，據談：溥逆原爲中華民國之公民，其在東九省甘受敵利用，妄自稱帝，所犯之罪行，與汪逆精衛，陳逆公博大同小異，自當以漢奸論罪，決不能視作戰犯，蓋戰犯須備有侵略國家及引起戰爭之罪行，「僞滿洲國」未經我國承認，國際間亦未予承認，况東北今已爲我收回，凡前僞滿官吏，皆應以漢奸治罪，漢奸與戰犯絕不能混爲一談。</p>
<h3>社論　請盟邦瞭解中國</h3>
<p>中國是聯合國中五大國之一。在世界交通日益發達的今天，中國與各盟邦，往來頻繁，關係密切，自不待言。中國人必須瞭解盟邦，盟邦亦必須瞭解中國。羅斯福總統夫人曾說，要求國際合作，必從國際瞭解開始，這實在是一針見血的話。而我們今天先須請盟邦瞭解中國者，有很基本的幾點。</p>
<p>第一，中國是愛好和平的國家，中國人尤其是愛好和平的人民。中國傳統的思想，向來反對「窮兵黷武」；所謂「止戈爲武」，「善戰者服上刑」，這一類名言，尤爲中國人民所服膺。馬歇爾特使在爲馮玉祥將軍餞行的席上，說中國人民素好哲學，而現則大異於前，似乎不好哲學面好戰。馬帥這句話，或許愛之深不覺言之切，談笑風生，近於幽默，其實中國一般人民決非好戰之徒。目前中國有許多地方在「停停打打」的內戰，其原因在於有少數「玩火」者想藉弄兵以爭地盤，而決非人民之所願。甚至他們口頭愈說「反內戰」，實際上「打內戰」愈打得熱烈。故人民所希望者，不是「反內戰」的漂亮口號，乃是根據正義公道而消弭內戰的事實。中國人民以爲制止內戰的方法，祇有主張正義公道，判別是非曲直，然後給破壞和平者以應有的制裁，使之不敢挑釁，方有效力，否則勢將勞而無功。馬帥夫人說馬帥因調處工作而睡不好，吃不好，我們固然慚感交幷，而馬帥沒有能够行使他調處人的公斷權，實在是拖延不决的一大因素。故我們先請盟邦瞭解，不是中國人好戰而不愛和平，乃是共產黨反對公斷而阻撓和平。</p>
<p>第二，中國人民今日旣不甘心媚外，亦决不有意排外。媚外或排外都是由於民族的自卑感造成的，惟有養成媚外奴性的人方有排外的言論與行動，二者同出於一源。中國爲聯合國之一員，不平等條约且已廢除，中國人應該自立自强，何苦媚外？而凡以平等待我之民族，根據恕道，也一定不希望中國再去謟媚它們。至於排外，則抗戰八年，得道多助，我們現在力求與盟邦携手合作之不暇，豈有妄圖閉關自守之理？而况美國對我眞誠援手，美軍目前駐華負有使命，中國人民更無絲毫反美心理。延安共黨「七七宣言」中，雖還根據莫斯科報紙的反美議論與毛澤東氏的反美廣播，仍在叫囂「美軍撤離中國」，但明眼人一定可以看出這種淺薄呼聲的司令台在什麼地方，而決非一個愛國的中國人民所願發的。美國遠東問題權威裴斐教授最近來華，與南京記者暢論我國時局，說中國當前迫切需要國家的和平統一；美國也眞心希望中國民主和平統一，絕無政治的領土的野心，美軍駐在中國，有利於中國和平，而引起蘇聯的疑懼，惟中國不能再利用國際矛盾，無論希望以蘇抗美或以美抗蘇，都是錯誤。近年來盟邦人士之了解中國，裴斐教授要算得數一數二的了。</p>
<p>第三，中國人民决不願見世界再有大戰，尤其不願見世界戰火在中國大地首先爆發。因此，中國萬無利用國際矛盾自討便宜的意思。老實說，中國名爲五强之一。而尙爲五强之「弱」，我們祇有掬誠相見，始可取信於盟邦。滿淸末年，辦洋務的人雖有「以夷制夷」的想法，我們相信國民政府決不採取這種下策。在今日中國國內，討論到國際路綫，也許有兩種截然不同依賴美國，以抵抗蘇聯的壓迫。其實這兩種見解，非愚即妄，都是要不得。中國在美蘇之間，縱不能盡兩國間橋樑的使命，至少是絕不想利用美蘇衝突，引起戰禍，因爲戰爭如果不免，則首先受害者不是美蘇，而將是淪爲戰塲的中國。我們要請盟邦瞭解的，中國今日祇知與平等待我之民族携手，祇知遵守中國所簽訂之國際條约，絕不反蘇，亦絕不反美；但同時亦更不願一部分人，仰承外人鼻息，來迎合那一國，反對那一國。中國人民自立之道在此；中國國家維護世界和平之道亦在此。</p>

<h3>由美英蘇法四國召集　和會請柬昨日發出　附有議事程序修正案　四外長會議開始商談德國問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦九日廣播：法國政府今日已發出請柬，邀請廿一個國家參加七月廿九日舉行之和平會議，此項請柬係用四強外長名　送出。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎九日電〕四國外長會議前因召開和會問題，陷於僵局，歷四日始打開，今日轉而討論德國問題，現在殷切等候蘇聯發表其對德政策之「重要宣言」。各方對此宣告之性質，猜測不一，或謂蘇聯擬會同美英法三國，在聯邦德國境內，成立中央管理機構，一說蘇方將譴責美英兩國「在蘇聯背後從事秘密談判」。外長會議於討論德國問題結束後，將商討奧地利問題及義大利政局，然後四外長或將休會，以便出席和會，和會程序條規，將於今晨由四國外大擬具，定午後提交四外長批准。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎八日電〕關於本月廿九日和會進行程序，四國外長會議頃已成立協議，並決定於本日午後即以請柬分送參加各國共十七國，此項協議乃應法總理兼外長皮杜爾之請，舉行秘密會議，並以皮杜爾所提出之折衷方案作為基礎，始告成立。</p>
<p>本日四國外長除舉行秘密會議一次而外，並於上下午舉行公開會議各一次，第一次係由美國務卿貝爾納斯主席，歷二時一刻之久，當休會時，四外長對於和會召集問題，猶未商獲成議。蘇外長莫洛托夫謂，和會召集日期既已共同決定，渠無意重行加以考慮，並主張立即發出請柬，但望和會進行程序草案能以附於請柬之內。關於議事程序，法國方面所提出之建議，可作為討論基礎，僅須附以修正案，載明無論和會全體大會或各委會凡所通過之決議，均須獲得出席人數三分之二多數。程序問題除外，祇須獲有普通多數，即可通過。美國務卿貝爾納斯答雲，四外長會議，前已決定和會召開日期，自應照辦，但若以默書方式，強令和會接受一種議事程序，則有未可。要之美代表團堅持立即發出請柬，其對於和會程序所有建議，並準備加以討論。英外相貝文所見從向，並謂和會任便修正議程之權利，如不加以限制，則渠本人準備考慮一切建議，同時又暗示請柬發出之後，法蘇兩國所提建議，均可加以討論。</p>
<p>至是貝爾納斯以主席資格，詢問英，法，蘇三國外長雲，「請柬應否即行發出」，英法代表均作肯定答辭，莫洛托夫則重行聲明無意展期召集和會，但仍認為有將議事程序草案附入請柬之必要，並謂，關於程序問題，已有三項先例可以援引：（一）一九一九年和會議事程序，係在事前決定；（二）聯合國大會議事程序，係由預備委員會預先決定；（三）關於此層，法代表團前於本年四月間有所建議，各方在原則上均未提出異議，此項建議，益以蘇聯方面所提出之修正案，（見上）均可附入請柬發出。莫洛托夫並暗示四外長會議，如因和會程序問題不能同意，則四外長凡所通過之決議，恐將再度成為問題。</p>
<p>美國務卿貝爾納斯亦即明白聲明，美代表團當在廿一國和會中，擁護四外長所一致通過之任何決議案，例如關於特港隸屬問題，賠款問題暨其他問題所已成立之決議案。英外相貝文意見從同，但各項問題凡未完全解決者，英代表團仍保留重行考慮之權。四國外長會議乃宣告休會，至午後五時，再度舉行秘密會議。</p>
<h3>巴黎外長會議中　蘇對德態度分析　須充分保障民治主義之實施　外軍應長期留駐俾確保安全</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科八日電〕巴黎四國外長會議即將討論德國問題，蘇聯對於此一問題所抱態度如何，自為各方所關切。據此間外交界人士談稱，關於德國未來問題，蘇政界及報界均未宣布任何具體方案。但蘇聯對德國問題之一般態度，可於德國戰敗以前所已奠定之各項原則中窺見一斑。該項原則規定德國負有戰爭責任，應喪失領土，但德國整個人民不應受懲處。德國務須保持統一，但須充分保障民治主義之實施。外國軍隊將繼續長時期佔據德國，以確保歐洲其他各國之安全。其中第一項原則規定德國人民。德國國格及國體均不在摧這列。德國人民須繼續在其領土範圍內行施其主權，德國應保持精社的政治的及經濟的團結。其尤重要者，即德國將來應永遠停止對於其他各國和平與自由之威協。惟欲達到此一目的，非求德國政治與經濟機構及民族精神之根本民治化不可。至於其他各項原則，均屬次要性質，可置不論。</p>
<p>以言瓜分德國使成為若幹獨立小邦一事而論，非但絕不能確保共同的和平，且將自始即形成威協，良以此種菉爾小邦，除被帝國主義者玩弄於掌握之內，將一無作為可言。蘇政府方面認為德國應負戰爭責任，自無疑義，並承認德國整具人民對於其　武領袖並未發生多大反抗，但同時亦認為德國人民不應不分皂白，一體治罪。——為德國人計，不僅應允許賠欵，且須割讓領土，俾德帝國主義之侵略行動，永不再見。蘇聯政府認為德國邊境現行修正狀態，乃為既成事實，此項修正對於蘇聯與其他東歐盟國，均有利益。蘇政府人士對於最近波蘭公民投票之結果，亦特別重視，波蘭此次以絕大多數贊成波蘭之新國界。蘇聯方面充分承認法國在不及一百年內，連受德得侵略三次，該國自有權獲得安全之保障。德國魯爾工業區應不復作為軍事與經濟武器及直接攻擊法國之兵工廠，但魯爾區同時亦不可成為反蘇聯之據點。</p>
<p>要之，蘇政府尚未就蘇聯對於　西部未來地位之見解，提出具體方案，政府人士僅　　蘇代表亟謀解決德國問題，充分準備加以討論。蘇政府人士當然亦承對德和約之成立猶嫌未足　剷除國社主義。推行民治。及根絕　武思想，均為長期艱辛工作。德國之佔據，必須歷相當時期，以蘇聯而論，該國若鬥幾及三年，始將希特勒之手下之侵略者驅逐，痛定思痛，對於此點，自無讓步餘地雲。</p>
<h3>同盟國信義安在　我未列入邀請國　外交協會滬會嚴正表示　堅決要求當局據理力爭</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎八日電〕四強外長今夜議決，於明日發出邀請參加七月廿九日所召開廿一國和會之請柬，並附以和會程序草案。中國結果仍未為和平會議之請柬，並附以和會程序草案。中國結果仍未為和平會議之召集國。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕中國國民外交協會上海分會，對於蘇聯外長莫洛托夫反對中國為和會邀請國認為失態，不僅無一再抗議，終未荷同意，至表遺憾，刻正草擬電文，分致美英法蘇等國，促其重行考慮。並電南京總會暨王外長及錢泰大使，作嚴正之表示，堅決要求據理力爭，以尊重中國之地位。</p>

<p>〔聯合社紐約九日電〕聯合國安理會近曾接獲阿爾巴尼亞·　羅·外豪·及阿富汗四國之入會要求，頃又有外約但王國請求加入為會員國，致潛在的衝突起因，今日似已在形成中，因此等新申請之國家，有一部份對於理事會即將考慮之各項問題，深具褊見，此點或將對是否准許各該國入會之問題，引起意見上之不睦。安理會現定明日下午七時會議，討論臨時條規，及研究技術上決定辦法，俾使設於海牙之國際法院對非會員國一致開放。</p>
<h3>原子能委員會　定今日開會　美擬就新備忘錄</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約八日電〕美國今日向原子委員會提出一新備忘錄，內中包含實行原子能管理章程之詳細提義，及懲罰違約辦法之精要。美代表巴魯克已命其屬員準備就緒，俟六國小組會於今日下午六時半（開會討論原子能管理問題時即可提出）。</p>
<h3>韓立法機構　在南部宣告成立</h3>
<p>〔合眾社　　九日電〕美佔領軍司令　奇中將今日核准在韓美軍佔領區內，成立一立法機關，但此非成立政府之謂，俟臨時政權成立之後，此一　關即將予以撤銷。</p>
<h3>菲律賓中部各省　武裝農民動亂　馬尼刺東南郊發生激戰</h3>
<p>〔聯合社馬尼刺八日電〕菲律賓武裝農民今日黎明前，在馬尼刺東南效外六裏美國第十三空軍　司令部麥金萊要塞附近發生激占工，旋被菲憲兵所驅散。此種戰鬥是否為政黨鬥爭，或僅盜匪火併，尚不得而知。同時呂宋島中部之無形戒嚴，亦有加強趨勢。據內長蘇呂泰宣布，騷擾區域菲憲兵員額將增加，自七月四日停戰協定失敗以來，中部各省衝突次數已日見增加。憲兵奉令追逐不法份子至其藏匿處所，加以隔絕，直至其允解除武裝而後已。據中部各省視察員談秒稱，政府此種政策，欲望武裝農民部隊就範，不啻椽木求魚。此外，新埃西嘉省政府代表報告，該省胡克族人不允登記或繳出槍械，該省稻田百分之八十均告荒廢，因農民無充分保護，鹹不敢下田工作。</p>
<h3>胡克族領袖　責政府施策</h3>
<p>〔聯合社馬尼刺八日電〕菲律賓胡克族領袖泰魯克今日向本社記者發表談話，指責羅哈斯總統及其他政府領袖之反動政策，謂此項政策足以妨礙呂宋島中部恢復和平，並引起全國騷擾。據稱，農業改革仍為根本問題，但菲憲兵之不法暴行，已引起騷動。呂宋島中部憲兵百分之八十為前日軍佔領時代之警察，農民對此輩恨之切骨。最近某村農民與政府人員衝突結果，農民百人殞命，巴邦加省農婦到處被憲兵強女奸，農會領袖兩人曾被割去舌頭。</p>
<h3>國際紅十字會　戰後首次會議　蘇聯代表尚未到達</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦八日電〕國際紅十字會頃在牛津舉行會議，此乃大戰以還第一次大會，到五十二國代表約二百人。蘇聯代表團雖已應允參加，（此亦屬第一次），但尚未到達牛津，美紅會會長奧孔諾爾致開幕詞。</p>
<h3>美報駐蘇訪員觀察　美蘇親睦不可能　蘇聯人民純真苦幹重實際　處獨裁政府不無自由可言</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約八日專電〕甫自蘇聯返美之紐約時報駐蘇特派員愛金生頃著論稱：美蘇親睦數年內尚不可能，而以友誼之道與蘇聯政府交往，亦必趨失敗之途，愛氏在其論文第一篇中，即謂「曾欲與蘇聯發生適當之關係，則吾人必須擯棄若幹有關友誼之通常熟習之觀念。」繼解釋稱，含義為親密聯擊政治妥協之「友誼」，並非吾人所需要，事實上既不可能，亦非此處所談及者。蓋蘇聯政府機構為一政治工具，而人類普通友誼之結交，則迥不相同。愛氏作結論謂，「吾等雖非敵人，然亦非友人，吾人所可冀求者至多，亦為維持數年之武裝和平」依愛氏之言，就大體而論，「蘇聯人民為可敬之人民，純真苦幹重實際，然在吾人與蘇聯人民之間，不幸而有蘇聯政府在，在旅蘇將近一年後，愛氏觀察得知，無產階級專政，實際上乃共黨政治局內十三委員之專政，蘇俄聯邦內根本無自由可言。」愛氏在調往莫斯科以前為重慶特派員時，曾謂，蘇聯政府因在聯邦境內慣於使用武力，故在其外交上亦具有其本能性之武力觀念，至此愛金生即主張美國亦須運用相等力量。並稱，「吾人利益所在，必須在相對方面施用相等威力，此乃處理國際事務之最反動方法，然自蘇聯政府對戰敗國之態度及東三省蘇軍之行為觀之，其政府之根本精神，即為反動。」</p>
<h3>田中隆吉追述　七七前夕　藉口反共製造自治</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京九日電〕前任關東軍參謀長田中隆吉今日繼續在國際法庭供稱：日擬在華北設立自治區時，欲謀有所藉口，最後乃決定採取「反共」口號。此為一九三五年所決定，關東軍即派遣土肥原至北平。田中避免提及日本任何侵略意向，其答語意欲證明中共遊擊隊及抗日份子追使日本出此。庭上聞此種行動是否促使關東軍及華北日軍決定設立華北五省自治區，田中答稱：此乃反共口號理由之一。山西半省被中央佔據，其目的在抗日救國。中央及遊擊隊使滿洲不安，日本欲設立緩衝區，以防中共軍繼　自中國本部初入滿洲。田中繼稱：多四與土肥原曾因華北駐軍問題發生爭執，友誼破裂；但兩人對於設立華北五省自治區問題見解相同。庭上部日本企圖在中國滋事否？田中厲聲答曰：「余謂自治運動意在對中國引起摩擦，已不止一次」。田中對於當時之關東司令南次郎，則作有利之辯護。同時，被告平沼騏一郎之辯護人要求將平沼自　集監獄遷至東京帝國醫院，被審判長魏勃駁斥。</p>
<h3>荒木在獄供辭</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京九日電〕國際法庭今日復審，檢察官提出被告前陸相荒木貞夫在巢鴨監獄中之口供，據稱：一九三一年十二月日　密院舉行會議，決定由陸軍佔據東北四省，是皇裕仁亦曾出席，但未發言，叩以日皇對佔領計劃是否批准，答稱：日皇對佔領計劃毫無所知，本人就任陸相後，不久即決定東北四省必須加以佔領平定。</p>

<h3>阿拉伯聯盟七國家　致英美備忘錄　請根據聯合國憲章精神　制定巴勒斯坦之新地位</h3>
<p>〔路透社開羅八日電〕阿拉伯聯盟上月召開理事會後，各阿拉伯國家即個別以備忘錄送達英美。該項備忘錄今夜由阿拉伯聯盟發表，內稱，巴勒斯坦之現狀必須終止，應代以根據聯合國憲章之精神及規定而確立之新地位。</p>
<p>〔路透社耶路撒冷八日電〕阿拉伯聯盟今夜發表文告，答覆美國就美調查報告發表之備忘錄，略謂：吾人感覺猶太復國會之政策，將促成阿拉伯東方與美國間之利益衝突，巴勒斯坦問題並非納粹迫害猶太人之結果，乃英國自第一次世界大戰時政策錯誤所直接造成。倘美國能以人道原則全面解決種族迫害問題，則自能獲阿族大擁護。</p>
<h3>美國新武器　細菌戰研製成功　破壞性比原子彈更可怕　傳一度擬用以襲擊日本</h3>
<p>在我們這大時代中因為細菌武器的成功，又免增加了人們的恐怖，由國會的參考資料中得來，海軍部對秘密武器已研究成功。這新武器的研究成功之重要，不僅是國際性，即目前美國國情如此，也不能忽略對它的一點常識。這裏先要聲明的是細菌用為武器的發現和研究成功，並不單是海軍部。美國對生物戰的試驗，早設有一獨立機構。這生物武器的破壞性，較原子彈更為可怕，然而卻不似原子彈製造時危險。除海陸軍兩部外，還有許多科學家和公務員參加這試驗工作，這些人中最重要的一個要算是喬穆克。</p>
<p>有三種功效</p>
<p>這種武器的功效可分為三種：第一種功效是它有烈性的毒質可以引起鼠疫。對獸類所做的試驗證明這種武器的毒性傳染開始時，可以很快的而且大量的殺死敵人。這種毒質是由一種常期有繁殖性和易於輸移的細菌中抽出來的。這細菌所繁殖的種子可在空氣中或土地上生存一個相當時期，並不需要特殊培養或專門的器械來培植。在這種情形之下，可把這些新生的種子制成炸彈投擲，或由特務人員攜帶到敵人境內散布，使其毒性發作。第二種功效是這種武器的毒性對植物和獸類也可以引起各種惡性病。</p>
<p>彈小毒性大</p>
<p>曾經有以這種方式對日本施用這種武器的傳說。假如原子彈在日投擲後不能促使日本屈膝，以這種細菌製成的一片似普通藥片的大小，可以將一片田地的稻田完全毒枯。當初預備對日施用這種武器的目的是要以它來斷絕日本食糧的供應。第三種功效是加濃毒性，施用的時候，可使它的作用及於極多數的人，譬如說，將這製成加濃毒性的武器放置敵人的水源中，凡飲水的人都要中毒。凡以這種細菌製成的毒片拌入食物中，如果份量稍重，中毒的人於五分鐘內之一刻可以死去。如果份量較少，就是上吐下瀉。醫好之後人弱無力，中了這種毒之後，究竟需要多少時候復原，現在還不知道。</p>
<p>殺人不見血</p>
<p>對這種新武器稍微想一下，就可知道這是帶有革命性的，新武器與原子彈的價值相同。自然這種細菌彈與原子彈不同之處是它並不似原子彈可以毀壞敵人的生產機構，而是從殺人的效能方面說，也不是絕對的；但在軍事方面說，價值之重大，仍是不可估計，因為這種武器的功效是殺人不見血的方式。這種武器可製成炸彈型，也可製成小型的藥片，隨身攜帶到敵人境內施用。最棘手的問題是統制這種武器比較原子彈要難得多。製造原子彈的方法非常管繁鎖複，而且需要許多設備；但生物武器呢？據一位權威說，在普通的麥酒廠裏就可以製造。</p>
<p>菌彈與和平</p>
<p>這些事實無疑的加重了美國在聯合國原子能委員會代表巴魯克先生肩頭的責任。目前在原子能管制有限的各種方式中沒有一種，可逃出一個基本的定論。如果原子能的管制可以成功，那麼凡參加的國家都要犧牲一部份的主權。艾其森所提議的原子能管制方法，最每個國家所需犧牲主權的最低限度。巴魯克或許要求每一個國家犧牲更多的主權，巴魯克最近到華盛頓是想在他正式對杜魯門提出建議書之前，做最後一次，對原子能管制政策的檢討。目前如每個參加這原子能管制會議的國家肯對這管制會犧牲一部份主權，那麼這國際機構就可在相當期間真正生效，利用這有效的國際機構，以和平的方式來解決國際間的問題，掃除彼此間的懷疑，而不致再蹈第二次世界大戰的覆轍。這就是美國政策的最後目的。（中央社譯自五月卅一日紐約前鋒論壇報）</p>

<h3>擴展上海市偉大計劃</h3>
<p>本市建築師與工程師八人，得技術專家之協助，費時五月，已擬定初步偉大計劃，將上海擴大為容納一千五百萬市民之成都市，是項計劃，現已呈交市府各局長研究，俾市政當局從而擬具詳細工作計劃，改造上海市，其第一階段以五年為期。依照初步計劃，本市商業區將擴展至南市，而南市錯綜複雜恍如迷宮之狹道小街，均須拆除，全部重造。漢口路將放闊，成為次要交通大道，西端貫穿跑馬廳，該廳本身一部份劃為民政管理機關中心地，餘者改建公園，全市其他各處，亦將添闢公園及運動場，距商業區食愈遠·則供市民遊散之公園面積愈大，以期增進市民健康。上海市郊區域將擴展至太湖畔及杭州灣邊之乍浦，主要工業區設在吳淞附近之蘊藻浜，主要港口依照總理遺訓，設在乍浦，吳淞區設次要港口。浦東方面開闢住宅區，惟什九仍將留供種植之用。據計劃設計人稱，中國人口居住都市者，約佔百分之五，根據他國情形推斷，中國逐漸實行工業化，可使都市人口增至百分之四十，理想中之上海人口為二千五百萬人左右，然容納此龐大人口所必要之區域，現在已經建立者，尚不足什一，故上海將有其他大都市所未獲之絕好機會，可在處女地上設計新的都市區域及完善之交通。數百年來，都市設計人僅致力於計劃龐大，對於現代生活中行動迅速之車輛交通，則類多忽視其重要性，故計劃中上海應闢有科學化設計闊達二百米之主要交通大道，及七十米闊之次要交通大道，以便就會繁路之車輛交通。設計人此次擬具計劃時，因乏各種統計及調查，致工作時異常困難，然費時五個月，已告完成，較諸倫敦及紐約都市計劃之設計，費時數載者，迅速多多。</p>

<h3>三告訴人分述受辱經過</h3>
<p>張庸　稱：在青年會任會計已四五年，廿三日午後在二樓圖書館看書時，突衝進二十餘人，手持木棍，總有糾察臂章，聲稱欲專捉破壞隊伍散發傳單之人，當告以青年會係宗教機關，不會有此事。是時九樓食堂內，適有一茶役手持由外拾得之傳單在看，遂被指為發傳單者，並指稱在九樓向隊伍丟擲洋瓶碟子等物，強欲架之以去，當與之論理稱，如欲捕人，出外叫警察來捉，不可用此種手段，遂被誣為特務，邊推邊打，出門口，又被綑綁遊行。走至馬浪路時，林漢達指揮稱：「國特」應加搜查，遂將鋼筆等特搜去，並將衣服剝下，一女學生走至背後以油漆寫上「特工」兩字，繼被押上卡車至復興公園，林漢達高立車上稱：現在抓到「國特」應該公審否？茲起附和。後適警局派人前來，乃跟往警局。隔日即出至南洋醫院醫治，當時我並未發現傳單，四被告中徐大毛即為在青年會打我者。張並當庭呈上是日被人紅漆塗寫之污衣三件。</p>
<p>俞晋榮　稱：中華職業學校學生，廿三日未參加遊行，但自上海市學生反內亂大同盟領得傳單五六百張，在河南路南京路口散發，被捕挨打，並被在背上寫字，拉上卡車，，當時徐朱刁皆在車上，而徐即為參加打毆打之一人。</p>

<h3>傳詢證人　目睹毆打情形</h3>
<p>另人告訴人邱生慶未到。證人中黃家慶亦缺席。傳詢其他兩證人顧欽　與李兆麟。</p>
<p>顧稱：曾參加反內亂之遊行，亦參加廿三日歡送所謂「人民代表」之遊行，是日行經青年會協大祥布號附近，有人來說青年會中有「國特」，我們包圍進攻。是時林漢達對眾言：捉到後是否需要公審？下面即喊處死刑等。彼等即自青年會押出一剃光頭穿西服姓張者，後旁邊有人見我手中拿有宣傳品，乃亦指為「國特」，將我抓住，問我是否為三民主義青年團團員，答稱不是。因無證件，故被稍打後即釋放。及回至反內亂大同盟辦事處報告，偕數人趕往復興公園以觀「公審」結果，至蒲柏路福煦路口，適扭交警局。</p>
<p>李稱：中正夜校學生，廿三日飯後在青年會圖書館看書，忽有遊行華眾擁入打人，阮光裕在旁呼打，後被帶走一人，數小時後在二樓問訊處見阮乘電梯自上下來，乃將阮帶往警局，在此民主時代，不應有此種妨害他人自由之事發生，我之所以將阮扭往警局，欲藉此問知真正之凶手。審訊至此告一段落，辯護律師起立稱：案卷未曾閱過，亦未曾接見過被告，下次當有反證提出，並請求將在押之徐大毛與朱講生交保，庭上未予允·該案展期至十六日上午九時再審·刁敏之阮光裕交原保徐大毛朱講生還押。</p>

<h3>榮德生綁案中接洽贖票一要犯　龍華寺內捉獲鄭連棠　事後布置周密原是此中一老手　女婿家中煤炭籮下吊出美金兩包</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕榮德生綁案內幕之複雜，以及破案經過之艱難，實為本市空前所未有·目前軍警當局所逮捕之各犯，雖已達二十餘名，惟據關係方面宣稱：尚不足該案全部人犯之半數。昨據本報記者獲悉：此次匪方負責與榮氏家屬接洽贖票手續之另一要犯鄭連棠（見圖），其捕獲經過亦費盡心計，鄭犯以前曾犯有綁案三起，一次被判無期徒刑，扣奉大赦開釋，另一次被捕後判處徒刑十二年，最近一次係在去年九月廿五日由袁仲杼主使與駱文慶等綁架本市泗涇路天和錢莊經理朱鄰圃未遂。故自榮案發生後，軍警當局緊密合作之結果，即得悉主犯係屬袁仲杼駱文慶兩名，根據綫索，從事偵查，其時榮氏家屬深恐肉票被撕，故所有接洽，均守口如瓶，因之不得已而求其多犯，惟經警局派員至鄭連棠住處（戈登路康脫路金司徒廟）隔壁時，亦已人去樓空，由此更證明鄭必屬同犯無疑。</p>
<p>榮氏出綁後不數日，警局接獲情報，謂鄭因此案而分得贓款四萬餘美金現存於金司徒廟內佛像腹中，當派幹員馳往該廟僅有老尼一名，經訊問結果，據云確有人以紙包一件藏在佛像腹，惟不知為何物，且已由「培德嫂」取去，及訊其「培德嫂」為何人？信何處？則又云不知。於是警局不得不從「培德嫂」着手，不久，終於得悉確有「培德」其人，係屬鄭之徒弟，旋在鄭家木橋將其夫婦拘獲，經訊問後供稱：「鄭在二日前至其寓處，娛樂邇來捕奸甚急，本人過去因有附逆嫌疑，故須暫避風頭，現有重要文件一包，藏於金司徒廟內，可囑汝妻速往一取，送至靜安寺路電車站，交一手執白扇足穿白鞋之男子，今後並望注意報紙記載云云。」警方根據是項綫索，逐步追究，最後在「培德」口中得悉鄭匿於龍華寺內，乃於七月五日清晨，風雨交作中按址前往搜捕，至時鄭尚臥於鼓樓中，彼本擬是日逃往他處，因天雨而止，遂束手就擒。據供贓款藏於其女婿家中，警方前往在煤炭籮底下抄出，一包計一萬元，另處抄出一包計兩萬元。據其婿供稱：鄭交與彼時，稱係私買之雅片，切勿開口以免氣味外溢，故始終未知究竟云云。至於鄭如何得能寄宿法華寺，據該寺和尚供稱：鄭平日茹素唸佛，常至該寺燒香，因而認識，此次鄭託詞與家庭口角，至寺中暫住，以解煩惱云云。</p>
<p>又該案幕後唆使犯申新二廠廠長詹榮培（見圖），經警局偵查後，發覺詹在榮案發生前，曾墊出國幣念萬元，作為進行綁架之資本，其所開具交與吳志剛之支票已吊出。</p>

<h3>駱文慶之妻亦被捕繼續起出贓款一部</h3>
<p>又訊：關於榮案破獲後，日前黃浦分局長杜醇文又得據密報，該案業已落綱之主犯駱文慶有一部份贓款，尚存入乃妻王翠英處，距王氏聞悉駱文慶業已就逮，深恐累及，將所有贓物皮箱，交與其妹唐王氏代為保管，托詞赴杭，暫避鋒頭，臨行時並將兩孩寄養。當時杜分局長不知駱妻下落，但風聞有業美昌夾計廠主馮景清者，詳悉其情，乃於昨日午後四時由股長周光輝股員曹儀蘭警長趙海如董海申等至吉祥街吉如里三號慎泰號探職美昌夾針廠址，獲悉馮景清寓居滬西愚園路一四二三弄梅邨八號，隨即按址馳住，將其拘獲。續往諸家橋十二號，又將唐山王氏就擒，一併帶局偵訊。訊王氏供稱：其姊王翠英所寄放之皮箱，現寄在城內侯家浜紫華路對過一二八號張緯良家，至於諸家橋十二號房屋，由馮景清代為租頂，嗣各警員據供，前往上述地點除將寄贓犯張緯良一併捕獲外，並抄獲皮箱一隻，內備美金票三萬五千元，金戒四只，共值國幣八千萬元。至有無其他發展，現正在嚴予偵訊中。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市聯青社·昨日中午在八仙橋青年會聚餐·市長吳國楨亦往參加，席間對於最近米市情形，曾發表談話，略謂本人蒞任之初，認為可以將來價壓平，惟事實上因上海環境複雜，加之潛在惡勢力之作崇，迄今黑市猖獗。若干奸刁米商及有組織之黃牛黨實難於對付。現經決定用配售米質地雖較差，恐僅為中下級市民所願購買，然目前我人最大努力即在解決此斗升小民之生活。吳氏最後並希望社會上之〔好人〕能與當局合作。</p>

<h3>問題中之行莊自行設法調整中　軋頭寸風波顯已過去</h3>
<p>［本報訊］本市金融市場，自受統債市價狂瀉，六底比期結帳之重重打擊後，先有大亞銀行之倒閉。本月四五兩日，市面頭襯驟緊，結果又有若干金融機構，遭受威脅，傳聞敦裕錢莊已出盤於揚子建業公司。大康銀行已出盤於長城銀行。尚有少數頭襯不甚充裕者，亦已紛紛拉攏有力份子重行改組，惟據票據交換所消息：自上週六起，各交換行莊之頭襯，已趨鬆動。交換所存款總額，已軋存三十億之鉅。故認為金融風波，已成過去。記者昨又以此次金融市場之風波，叩詢中央銀行金融機構業務檢查處長李立俠氏，據談：此次金融市場之風波，並不如外界所傳之嚴重。總計上海多刺機構，大小共達三百餘家，而發生問題者，不過三五家。中央銀行之立場，非至必要時，對金融市場，不擬有所措施。尤以對此次事件，如出而協助，不帝對此等機構，予以獎掖，李氏旋舉去年八月底至九月半時，重慶金融市場之波動為例，是時因影響過大，中央銀行乃出面維持，風潮終至平息。李氏末謂：本市投機氣氛，向較他處為濃。深望各金融機構經營業務，應以穩健為主。</p>

<h3>台糖公司負責人談糖價飛漲經過情形　下星期或將直接配售市民</h3>
<p>［本報訊］日來糖價飛漲，各界均表關注，對台灣糖業公司工作情形，評述尤多，記者因於昨日特訪該公司部經理宋以信氏，承告：遠東產糖中心，向為荷印，菲列賓，台灣三處，因土地，氣候及人工種種關係，各地價格不等，以戰前而論，爪哇糖每磅約合美金三分，菲島糖每磅須五分之多。我國每年所需糖量，除東北外，達六十萬噸至八十萬噸之鉅，大多皆從荷印採購，經理此項荷糖者，即太古洋行。至於台糖則因價昂之故，戰前從無進口，即或偶有小額發見，亦係日人走私而來。至菲島之糖，則皆免稅運銷美國，故我國亦不進口。</p>
<p>台灣糖之產銷</p>
<p>台灣糖業，自經日人一再鼓勵，產量確亦增加，故先時年產雖僅三十萬噸，而至一九三九年，竟一躍而至年產一百四十萬噸之最高峯，至其增產主因，實因日人強迫勞工制度使然。其後二年，略見減少，至一九四一年太平洋戰事發生後，日人因糧食恐慌，在台減少種蔗，而多種雜糧。糖之產量，因而劇減，至最近我國前往接收時，年產已低至二三十萬噸，當時實存糖共十五萬噸。自十二月至三月中，又於存蔗中製糖九萬噸，故台灣糖業公司開業之時，手頭所有，亦祇此二十四萬噸而已。目前台灣人民，皆不願植蔗，因台灣天氣種稻一年可二熟或三熟，而種蔗則須十八個月始能收穫一次，故預計明年產量，恐不過三四萬噸，連該公司所有之二十四萬噸，共二十七八萬噸，須維持國內銷路十八個月之久，困難實多，故台糖雖能來滬，若謂即能打倒洋糖，實屬言之過早，政府實深盼古巴等地之糖，能源源進口，以解恐慌，因荷印此數年來積聚之糖一百五十餘萬噸，已盡於此次內戰中全部毀損，爪哇今日所需之糖，竟亦仰仗進口，決無銷售我國之可能也。</p>
<p>四次拋售經過</p>
<p>該公司成之初，本擬每月運滬一萬噸，但招商局因種種關係，船隻發生困難，故至本年七月二日為止，祇到六千噸，此次糖價之漲，運輪實為主因之一。該公司係於五月一日成立，廿四日開始配售，至配售辦法，係以五十包為一組，由糖業公會各會員申購，每星期配售一次，第一期一千噸，每百斤售價六萬六千元，第二期一千三百噸，價格不變，第三期一千二百噸，售價六萬六千五元元，各糖商均能照申購數量全部購得，所得利潤約百分之十至百分之十五。至第四期（六月十三）配貨時，各糖商回知該公司運輪困難，存貨不充，明知有利可圖，申購量突增至四千五百噸之多，超過該公司存量胡鉅，乃與糖業公會商定，根據以往三期申請額平均核減，售出九百噸，而在六月八日以後新成立之糖行，則均被拒絕售給，以杜投機倖進之途。當時市價已抬至八萬一千元，該公司為維護國家利益，而免糖商暴利，遂將糖價亦酌增至每百斤七萬三千元，於是未能買得之糖商　怨聲四起，而集矢於該公司，謂為「有糖不賣」，同時糖價又抬至每担十二萬，該公司無可奈何，乃托糖業公會之掮客，自六月二十日起，直接至市場拋售，因該公司如不經該公會掮客之手，實無至公會售糖之地位也。且若巡由該公司職員前往拋售，則高低之間，又何從而洗偏倚私之嫌？食糖每包十餘萬元，而掮客所得佣金，每包祇二百五十元，若謂因此二百五十元之佣金而即增加糖商之負担，則所增亦可謂極微。</p>
<p>該公司旋接台灣來電，謂六月二十三日右有糖般一艘來滬，乃於六月二十五日，將所有存糖全部出售（八百噸），價為每担九萬八千元。且因確知有貨可來，又出售期貨三千噸，每担九萬五千元。不意在此來貨即將湧到之頃，人心看低，加之銀根又緊，銷路大減，故至今糖商竟尚有三四萬包未能提貨，目前竟有反對跌價，唯恐再受損失者。</p>
<p>優待糖業辦法</p>
<p>實則該公司為維護糖行利益，亦已煞費苦心，凡公會會員購糖，均有九九折扣，每袋並另加糖兩斤，而銷運外埠者，該公司並指派職員，專為彼等代辦執照等手續，故深望各糖商皆能自覺，一方面請政府鼓勵國人自外國購糖，俾我國能解決不日即來之嚴重糖荒也。</p>
<p>可能直接配售</p>
<p>宋氏又稱，下星期起，該公司當可接奉上峯命令，對配售辦法，或有更變。宋氏並暗示有與市府合作直接配售各市民之可能。</p>
<p>昨日台灣糖業總公司來酌，說明辦理經過及方針，與上述一致相同，故不重錄。記者</p>

<h3>上海市公用事業　迴顧與前瞻（續）（完）</h3>
<p>— 趙曾珏</p>
<p>煤氣方面</p>
<p>關於煤氣方面，按本年五朋份統計，本市英商上海煤氣公司產量，每日平均為三·七五〇·〇〇〇立方英尺，吳淞煤氣廠產量，每日平均為六〇·〇〇〇立方英尺，共計為三·八一〇·〇〇〇立方英尺，兩廠用戶總數為一九·六一五戶，平均每日用量約二〇〇立方英尺，惟夏日煤氣用量，較之冬季約少百分之十一，且到了冬季，煤氣供應，將更成問題，故如何設法增加煤氣公司之煤氣產量，是當明最迫切的問題，茲將治標治本兩方面略談如下：</p>
<p>（一）先談治標方面，可分為兩部言之：</p>
<p>（甲）督促英商上海煤氣公司與吳淞煤氣廠聯合供應東區虹口一帶住戶所需之煤氣，此事須裝置輸送站及儲氣櫃之設備，一切詳細設計，正由該廠研究擬辦中</p>
<p>（乙）英商上海煤氣公司與市公用局局長趙曾珏研究，擬酌量採用印度煤；因為印度煤氣之用，按一般印煤成份，固定炭約含45%，揮發物40%，硫化物1%，水份及炭份頗低，約為1%及13%，較之其他煤類含水份5%灰份15-22%為少，在運輪可以減少重量，且因所含固定炭及揮發物成份較多，每日可增產一百萬立方英尺，並促其增添水煤氣設備，俾達供應之目的。</p>
<p>惟在英商上海煤氣公司及吳淞煤氣廠產量尚未增加以前，本市各煤氣用戶，應儘量節省，避免不必要之消耗。</p>
<p>（二）再談治本方面：</p>
<p>現在煤氣公司所供給的煤氣，每立方英尺的熱力，不過三五〇BTU,因為煤質的差，現在用的是開藻煤，中興煤比較合宜，印度煤當然更好，如吾們能用適當的煤，每立方英尺的煤的熱力可以提高至四〇〇BTU，因為吾們購買煤氣，並不是為煤氣，乃是為熱力。</p>
<p>煤氣是最經濟清潔的燃料，並且還有價值之副產品。</p>
<p>關於將來本市之煤氣事業，須積極擴充並完成一個完整的高壓煤氣綱（High　pressure　gas　grid）方能供應大都市我民之需用，全市不妨先分成三區，（甲）吳淞閘北區，由吳淞煤氣廠負責供應（乙）舊法租界及舊公共租界區，收英商上海煤氣公司負責供應，（丙）南市區，另行籌設新廠負責供應，各廠總管互相聯繫，以免供應民生阻礙。</p>
<p>碼頭倉庫</p>
<p>本局現在管轄之碼頭，除沿蘇州河兩岸之小型碼頭外，計有舊工部局所有之外灘碼頭十五座，舊法公董局的有之天文台碼頭等六座，舊日軍遺下之碼頭六座，共廿七座，其中有五座，為美海軍佔用，二座為海關佔用，一座為郵局佔用，一座早已沉沒，一座為水警佔用，一座為市輪渡使用，實際能使用者祇十六座。</p>
<p>舊工部局外灘碼頭尺度短小，戰前僅供並泊鐵駁及小輪，法公董局之碼頭祇作並泊木駁及機船，現因碼頭太少，大部輪船均指泊於外灘碼頭。</p>
<p>據五月份統計，以上十六座碼頭，並泊鐵駁輪船，共二千五百七十二艘，共三十三萬二千零六十四噸。（木駁帆船不在內）平均每日並泊八十三艘計一萬〇七百餘噸，以十六座碼頭負担如許並泊船隻，基不能適應當前環境，顯然可見。</p>
<p>我們為緊急補救起見，準備從速推進下列各事：</p>
<p>（一）恢復南市碼頭：戰前南市碼頭共十一座，接收時祇剩敵人遺下六座，且超出濬浦綫約七十尺，不合定章，現擬將上項碼頭及舊有碼頭，合共十一座，先在裝置地位上予以調整，調整以後，再在騰出之地位上，建築新碼頭十一座。</p>
<p>（二）與航商合作或貸款興建碼頭倉庫：為應急起見，擬在沿浦適當地點劃出公地若干，與杭商合作投資，或向金融機關貸款，興建碼頭倉庫，各若干座，以應需要。</p>
<h3>調整價格</h3>
<p>至於治本計劃，亦必須配合上海都市建設計劃，依據港口布置，作精密設計，大致將來所有碼頭倉庫，應集中在下列各處：</p>
<p>（一）自江灣虬江碼頭至吳淞鎮一帶，闢作深水港之港埠區域，停泊海洋船隻，以便轉運國內外貨物，及供應該處工廠之用。</p>
<p>（二）日暉港連接滬杭鐵路，作中等淺水港港埠之用，專供沿海船隻及該處工業原料貨物進出之用</p>
<p>（三）浦東和豐船廠附近碼頭，俟浦東繁榮後，再進行建築。</p>
<p>（四）蘇州河河口至曹家渡一帶，工廠甚多，該地應作為淺水港布置碼頭倉庫。</p>
<p>以上各碼頭之建築，應具備新型碼頭設備，各碼頭之裝卸物資應分類組合，如煤，糧食，機械，油類等分別地區裝卸，其設備應照起卸貨物之性質，作最新式之裝置。</p>
<p>本市物價不斷上漲，加上工資激增，各公用專業公司收支，無法平衡，沒有一個不虧負累累。這種現象，不但使投資者裹足不前，事業不能擴充，就是舊有設備的修復，經常事業的維持，也將無從措手。這樣除掉接受公司請求予以合理的調整外，簡直另無辦法。</p>
<p>本局復員以來，對於公用事業價格，已作三次調整，但均採取顧到小用戶的負担，節約大用戶的方式，經過精密的計算，務求合理，其情形大概如下：</p>
<p>（一）電價：是按煤價增漲率決定的去年調整價格時，曾規定煤價每噸高下一千元時，各級電價可隨之高下二元，所以到本年三月終，四月初，配給煤價，每噸增至二萬九千九百七十元，比前高出一萬三千餘元，因核准各級各電每度加二十六元，其他暫不顧及。</p>
<p>（二）自來水價格的核定：先調集各公司所開成本計算書，綜合研究，取最少用料最低物價計算，水價每立方公尺必須國幣一百二十元，因即以此數為核定價。</p>
<p>（三）煤氣價格的決定：先將有關售價之各因素，列成一固定計算公式，再調查各因素的現時準確價格，分別代入公式，然後算出合理的價格，根據此次計算之結果，因核定調整價格，為每度四百元。</p>
<p>（四）電車及公共汽車：因公司虧蝕過鉅，不特舊車無無法修復，即經常維持費用也將無法維持。車輛損毀，乏款修理，造成更嚴重的局勢，所以必須定以比較寬裕價格，電車頭等自九十元至二百元，三等自六十元至一百元，無軌電車自九十元至一百八十元，公共汽車自一百元至三百元，惟調整以後，規定各公司必須酌提相當數目，搶修舊車，務使所有車輛，在短時期內均得為市民服務，同時為顧及市內行政機關公務人員及學校員生負担起見，責成各公司發售半價月季票，以示優待。</p>
<p>（五）電話價格：因現時話務超載過重，所有設備萬難應付，如欲添置器材，一時也不易購到。這為使公司收支確保平衡，誘導市民節制使用電話起見，故採用累進收費辦法，即通話次數在規定限度以內，取費甚廉，超過限度取費比例加高，使通話次數較少之小用戶，不致過分加重負担，而公司方面，卻可增加相當收入，彌補積虧，（調整後之話費，每月在一百次以內，平均每此二十五元，一百次以上每次五十元，二百次以上，每次一百元，三百次以上，每次一五〇元，超過四百次，每次二百元，公用電話一律每次一百元。）公用事業固應以服務為前提，但亦不能不顧到其業務的維持。假如業務一旦停頓，市民所受的損失與痛苦更大。因此我們對於市民負担不容忽略，必須在雙方兼顧的原則下，折衷取決，截至現在止，上海的水，電，煤氣，電車，汽車等公用事業的價格，較中國任何一地為便宜。</p>

<h3>防疫聲中的幾個問題</h3>
<p>— 伯淦</p>
<p>霍亂愈來猖獗。從衛生局發表的數字看來，患者與死亡日見增多。截至本月二日為止，已有患者一〇三四人，此數已達一九二六年（民國十五年）大流行時的紀錄之半，而目前的時令，照往年的情形來說，還沒有進入霍亂季節，或者僅是霍亂季節的開始。又據專家就過去霍亂流行的紀錄，指出上海在今年可能確到霍亂的週期。所以我們急切的為霍亂而担心。我們希望全上海的一致努力，撲滅這種可怕的疫病，同時也格外注意衛生當局對於防疫方面的種種措施。</p>
<p>上海的衛生當局，認為防疫一事，責無旁貸，此種態度，實足欽佩。但是衛生當局究竟有多少辦法，則請看下列的敘述：</p>
<p>第一，關於疫苗問題。我們記得去年九月接收開始的時候，上海一度發生霍亂，當時衛生當局曾經公開宣稱，上海市的霍亂疫苗，供給一市，尚有餘之裕。依常理說，上海是個工商業中心，凡屬此一中心的附庸地區，其所需用的疫苗一類物品，自然將仰給於上海。易言之，上海對其附庸地區負有供應疫苗的義務。再從防疫的需要來說，當此交通頻繁的時代，上海與附近大小城市之間互相聯繫，不可自劃範圍。倘若上海四周霍亂大盛，則上海亦難保於安全。所心附近城市在防疫上如有需要幫助之處，上海衛生當局應當慨然加以考慮，斷不可籠統拒絕。我們知道上海衛生局過去曾將局內所製的疫苗供給其他省市，就此推想，本市疫苗不僅取給敷足，而且確有餘裕。可是此刻疫情緊張，我們忽然聽說衛生局禁止疫苗銷售外埠而提抗戰。人們對於禁銷外埠上點，認為如非本市存貨過缺，不宜有此舉措。同時因此我們懷疑：究竟衛生局自身所生產的疫苗是否足夠該局推行防疫工作用？上海市所製的疫苗，是否足應上海市的需要而無匱乏之慮，衛生局對此須有一個精確的計算；倘使計算結果並無不足，便應將此計算公開。</p>
<p>第二，關於病床問題。霍亂病人日益增多，幾處隔離醫院皆有人滿之患。據本月一日報載，本市共有隔離病床五九〇張，市立第一第二傳染病醫院共二百五十張，西藏路時疫醫院一百五十張，上海傳染病醫院二十張，廣慈醫院一百張，急救時疫醫院七十張。其中除廣慈醫院尚有二十餘張空床位之外，其他各醫院均已宣告額滿。西藏路時設醫院因其地點適中，而且具有歷史性，來抽病人特多。據計本月二日該院共有住院病人一百四十八人，門診病人六百八十二人。有些霍亂病人，送到醫院，因為沒有病床，只好注射一陣之後，馬上打發回去。病床不足，於此可見。衛生當局對於這一點，一定是很明白的。我們也曾聽說衛生局將由善後救濟總署捐贈活動木屋，正在請款搭建，又聽說國立上海醫學院於必要時可以將楓林橋的中山醫院借作時疫醫院。可是直到現在為止，我們只聽見衛生局在計劃在準備，卻不曾見在什麼地方確確實實為霍亂病人添了幾張病床。這原因是病床難添麼？還是做事的效率問題？過去上海每逢霍亂流行，都有社會人士出來義務的組織臨時時疫醫院，去年重慶發生霍亂，也有許多社會團體致力此事。現在上海的霍亂憶成燎原之勢，衛生局如果自身力量不夠，就應當赽將社會力量發動起來。</p>
<p>第三，關於經費問題。本月二日報上，我們看到一個消息，說是衛生局防疫總隊消毒工作人員，因為六月份止半月的薪津沒有發下，所以拒絕出去。這個消息即在平時聽到，也是十分驚人的，何況正在「防疫如救火」的時候！此刻各機關經費困難，我們十分明暸，同時我們也希望吃公務飯的人賠錢幹事。不過對於衛生局欠薪怠工一點，我們三願意一明真相。經過多方面的探聽，我們知道市政府所屬各局，已照新頒標準發放了六月份的薪津，惟有衛生局，到今日為止，僅僅發放了六月份上半月的薪津，而且是按舊標準發的。同時，我們又聽說衛生局有一部分職員在行總兼差，他的出納行長就是兼差的一位，所以常不在局。我們覺得，上述種種，倘若屬實，那末今日的衛生當局非但不足以防疫，並且不足以辦任何公事。試想目前公務員，如此菲薄的薪津，到了月底還不能發放，叫人如何過活？再論經費的調度，如果一個機關連薪工都不能按期發放，則其他經費可知。如此情形，應付常態猶有未可，如何還能應付緊急局勢？</p>
<p>以上所提三點，都是最簡單，最具體的瓿。其他有關於防疫者，如宣傳與教育，如飲食品之管理，如環境衛生之推行等等，也有許多需要改善或加強的地方。我們十分贊佩衛生當局平素所表白的勇於負責與樂於改進的精神，但疫勢猖獗如此，空言無補實際，希望衛生當局格外努力。</p>
<p>社會服務</p>
<h3>答覆記者　法律質疑</h3>
<p>（一）金履中間　民國十一年間，先父將田產憑中抵押於X姓，當成立契約五年為期，將租作息，至三十一年先父亡故，鄙人當即會同原中向X姓取贖，均得面允，嗣後屢向催促，以期早清手續，不料故意托詞延宕，迄今又去信催促，忽接通得復信稱：「清理不動產條例，典當辦理第八條以立約之日起十年內准許贖出。如十年外，當然不能取贖，況此田已屆二十餘年條例具有明文，斷非杜斷可以欺人」云云：</p>
<p>如此看來，已不能取贖，但既於三十一年及以後幾次允贖在前，何今回絕於後，顯見欺人太過，蓄意侵吞，現擬訴諸於法，下列數則，請予賜覆：（一）不動產條例典當辦法究為立契之日起幾年之後作放棄論？（二）在抗戰八年期內，如申述不能照規定年限清理之理由，則能否成立？（三）立約時之契價為銀洋或為紗洋，有何計算標準？</p>
<p>（曹亞俠建律師答）（一）十年；（二）如抗戰時期猶在得回贖之期限內者，則得按照復員後辦理民事訴訟補充條例第七條規定，於該條例施行後二年內行使回贖權；（三）並無計算標準，出典人得以數量相同之法幣返還，但典權人得依前條例第十二條之規定請求增加給付。雙方發生爭議時，得訴請法院公平裁量。</p>
<p>（二）沈漢英問　讀者於戰前向某君押進生財及雜具，後因戰事發生，敝處首當其衝，故所押進之物件，損失大半，當時付過押款，今某君欲還款收回自用，現在有疑問兩則：（一）因戰事所損失之物，押進者是否負賠償之責？（二）如負責賠償，可否照押進時物價計算？敬請答覆。</p>
<p>（曹亞俠建律師答）（一）因戰事不可抗力所致之損失，可不負賠償之責。（二）對於回復請求人。僅以因減失或毀損所受之利益為限。負賠償之責。</p>
<p>（三）陳伯康問　先父於廿六年十一月亡故，遺有房屋一幢，迄今猶未過戶，現欲過入鄙人戶名，但先父亡故時遺產稅尚未施行，現在過戶，不知要納遺產稅否？</p>
<p>（曹亞俠建律師答）據收復區直接稅征免辦法乙項之規定，遺產稅部分，收復區在淪陷期內，（即民國三十四年九月二日以前）所發生遺產繼承事實，一律免征遺產稅。</p>

<h3>廣東的新生</h3>
<p>廣東是南中國的一座堡壘，這府堡壘的堅固與否，影響及於全中國者非常重大；因此全國人士，對於廣東省復員以後的情況，表示十二分的關切。而況筆者，對於桑梓的關懷，更非尋常可比。最近將竟路回去住了一個多月，對於廣東最近的施政情形作了一點比較深刻的考察，現在就把自己所知道的一切，簡單地寫在下面，以供時賢之改正</p>
<p>為政不在多言</p>
<p>省主席羅卓英先生，是一位有名的實幹人物。他過去治軍，曾以富於建設性的作風，為當世所稱道。現在到廣東來主持省政，更使人認識了他的為人與才具；他的人生觀，好像只有一個單純的「幹」字；而他的才具卻是多方面的；他的舊學好根底甚好，對於懦家學術中的經世之學，他是很有心得的。在當兵的時候，每到一處，必然教他的軍隊。幫助當地的老百姓修築道路，甚至修建文廟和公園等等有關文化的建設事業。後來，他在桂林，在重慶的青年軍，更運用軍隊的力量，把附近的公共事業整理得井井有條。至今桂林的李家村，和重慶的大抨，還有成績擺在那裏呢，不過，筆者在此，並不想替羅卓英先生寫傳記，所以要加以說明的緣故，是讓讀者知道我們廣東的政治，所以能夠漸漸走上新生的道路，決不是一件偶然的事。</p>
<p>去年九月，羅主席一到廣東的時候，就遵照中央的指示，在省府會議上通過了五條施政大綱：（一）選賢任能，樹立廉正風氣。（二）扶植農工，改善人民生活。（三）健全縣政，鞏固憲治基礎。（四）獎勵科學，促進現代文化。（五）發揚僑務，充實建設力量。</p>
<p>這此綱領，一經決定，就馬上見諸實施，沒有折扣，也不知道偷懶。唱高調三字，在他們的字典上找不到的。</p>
<p>往事回憶種種</p>
<p>廣東並不是一個簡單的省份啊！凡是熟悉一點政治情形的人，總還記得吧？廣東一向是很複雜的。又加上淪陷七年，敵人為了要打通和保持所謂大陸生命綫起見，曾經殘酷地摧毀了粵中和粵南的所有物質設備。對於淪陷區的血腥統治和剝削也遠甚於其他各省，何況又是汪逆的家鄉，陳逆壁君，經常在廣州坐鎮，歷來的偽省長，者是汪，陳的親戚。於是爪牙廣佈，荼毒殘害，無所用其極，因此廣東省逃入內地的義民也特別多。</p>
<p>勝利以後，義民們蜂擁回家；可是家園破碎了，不但房屋和家私蕩然無存，就連最起碼的耕田器具也已不知去向。於是義民一變而成難民，輾轉各地，過其流離的生活。</p>
<p>廣東省在復員之初計提出「撫輯流亡」「恢復交通」「清除盜匪」，「安定民生」，這四項初步的計劃。一面向中央竭力呼籲救濟，經過半年多的努力，破碎的廣東，才處有了一點復蘇的希望。</p>
<p>現在廣州一地，就有二百八十餘所平民寄宿舍收容難民。有十七所平民食堂供難民進食。（每一餐飯，僅收國幣五十元）此外，又發動各慈善團體及女青年會等機關，施送飯票和麵包，實行緊急的救濟。</p>
<p>各江的交通，亦漸漸安定，義民們陸續返回各地，靠著縣政府的幫助，都在整理家園或者作些小生意。各地社會情形漸漸恢復戰前的狀態了。</p>
<p>廣東新生跡象</p>
<p>與善後工作同時並進的，就是如何建設新廣東的問題了。</p>
<p>健全幹部，是推行新政的先決條件。復員初期，省府就設立了一個訓練團，訓練地方行政的幹部人員。如今觀音山的下面，中山紀念堂的後邊，這個富有歷史意義的所在，已成了革新廣東政治的搖籃——全省的專員縣長，以至其他各部門的行政工作人員，都要調來此地受訓練；內中科目很少，大致可以分為政治訓練和專業訓練兩類。那時候，全省的行政費，都是拮據萬分，這個團自然更不用說，常常這伙食也有朝不保夕的情況。可是他們很有朝氣，即使窮的飯多吃不飽的時候，而全團自上至下的人們，莫不精神奮發，一個個實行「窮幹」「實幹」的主張，在緊張中充滿新生和樂觀的氣象。羅主席兼團主任。張明先生任教育長。這位張先生的幹勁也特別大。簡直到了拼命的程度。因為房子不夠用，要添造幾間，沒有錢；於是張教育長，就發起了一個揀磚頭的運動，規定每人每天揀一百塊磚頭回來。張教育長自己也親自動手，反正有的是敵人炸剩下來的無主的斷磚破瓦。不到一個月的流汗工作，房子修起來了。替公家省了十分之七以上的費用。</p>
<p>他們這種幹的精神，我不禁從心裏減出：「佩服」兩字，以這樣一班人出去做地方官，廣東的地方政治還有不能改善的嗎？</p>
<p>這些都是南中國的精神堡壘啊！</p>
<p>最後的幾句話</p>
<p>最近省府又決定了一個復興廣東的五年建設計劃：一，首重經濟建設1.以奠定工業化基礎謀人民衣食兩項物資之大量增加，以改善人民生活，充實國防力量為主。2.農業方面，除謀增產糧食個，並注意提倡博取外匯之農產品。3.興修水利，發展交通，開發礦藏等有關經濟建設的事業。二，文化建設：1.國民教育，則以一保一校為原則。2.中等教育，職業與師資並重。3.注意邊民教育，使廣東之少數民族，得享受同等之教育。三，政治建設：1.健全民間機構。2.注重公共衛生。3.提倡社會福利培養社會風氣。4.扶助歸僑，辦生產事業。</p>
<p>以上，只是計劃的大意，至於他的原文很長很多，筆者恕不在此一一抄錄了。</p>
<p>這個計劃，很顯然是以經濟建設為主，並且側重於工業方面。建設工業化的廣東，條件是夠了的。且看怎樣去實施就是了。（筱莊述·琢卿筆錄）</p>

<h3>空前饑荒彌漫全球！　五萬萬人已正在饑餓綫上掙扎</h3>
<p>— 此文係美農長安德生所著，君默譯自柯里亞雜誌</p>
<p>已無充分糧食救濟世界饑荒</p>
<p>聯合國糧食會議已經開過了。我們也許可以希望他們能想出些方法，使將來的世界不致再遭饑饉，但目前，能夠使饑荒不再變得更嚴重，就已經算是很好的了。因爲事實是：世界上已沒有足夠的糧食，可以解救這遍及全球的，空前的大饑荒。</p>
<p>五萬萬人民正掙扎在饑餓綫上。假使我們美國人少吃一點，假使我們能減少百分之四十的小麥消耗，那末，成千成萬在死亡邊緣上的人民，也許就可以得慶更生。但即使如此，也只不過能稍稍減輕一點饑荒的痛楚，要想把整個的饑饉從世界上驅走，已經是不可能的了。</p>
<p>即使糧食豐足的國家竭其所能來援助他們，世界上五萬萬飢餓的人民，也仍難都得到解救。而且，即使我們美國人今天也是和他們一樣地饑餓，我們也決難真正了解他們的痛楚，因爲他們在長年的戰爭中已經飽嚐了凍餓，到今天，已無法能像從前吃飽過肚子的人那樣忍受饑餓了，許許多多人已奄奄一息，——許許多多人已經餓死，許許多多人因爲營養不良，難抗疾病，而致於死了。</p>
<p>如果一個美國人多吃了一塊原可不吃的麵包，那他事實上，就是促使了在印度，中國，意大利，南斯拉夫，或者奧大利的一個人的死亡。</p>
<p>本年上半年，世界上饑餓的國家需要兩千萬噸的小麥。但世界上小麥過剩之國家，最多也只能輸出一千二百萬噸。同時，遠東吃米的國家，印度，中國，和日本，今年所缺的米糧，要超過全世界能輸出的總量的兩三倍。</p>
<p>只有在美洲和澳洲的一部分，能供給相當數目的多餘糧食。在美國上半年最低的目標是希望能輸出小麥七百萬噸。這個目標能不能夠超過，或者能不能夠達到，——就全靠美國人能不能夠自己節食了。</p>
<p>似乎是上天有意的惡作劇，在這饑荒遍地的時候，世界上的兩個食糧生產國家，阿根廷和澳洲，也因爲旱災而收成不佳。雖然如此，輸出還是有希望。在加拿大和澳洲，主要的食糧仍在定量配給；在阿根廷，燃料永遠是不夠的，我們準備供給他們煤和油料，使他們不必再用糧食和菜油來當柴燒了。</p>
<p>兩天吃一次慢性的餓死</p>
<p>到今年七月一日，美國的小麥含量大概有一二五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美斗。至目前止，氣候的情形是異常良好，今年冬天的小麥收成可能達到八三〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美斗。把我們的情形和歐洲的一萬萬飢民比一比吧：百分之七十四的奧國人，百分之四十三的芬蘭人，百分之七十五的德國人，百分之五十九的意大利人，百分之五十的匈牙利人，他們一天只吃幾小片麵包，——這簡直是慢性的餓死呀。</p>
<p>在美國，孩子們在學校裏有中飯吃，但在歐洲的許多國家裏，孩子們餓得無力讀書，先生們餓得無力教，父母們餓得無力指導他們溫習功課。在美國，孩子們在學校裏有牛奶吃，但在希臘，已只能把麵包搗溶在橄欖油裏算是牛奶了。當聯總的第一批糧食運到一個南斯拉夫的小村時，那裏的村長緩緩地說：</p>
<p>「我們的孩子們只隔天吃一頓。」</p>
<p>歐洲的飢荒，主要的是兩種原因，第一是旱災，近代史上最嚴重的一次旱災，使地中海兩岸，北非，西班牙，法國和巴爾幹半島的禾稼盡枯。而且歐洲的土地是靠了肥料的，戰爭間斷了施肥的工作。事實上，戰爭本身也是一個致命的原因，農地變成了戰塲，加上農業器械的缺乏，人力和獸力的不足，使歐洲的收穫弄得十分可憐，而內陸交通的破壞，更是增加了飢饉的嚴重性。</p>
<p>疾病與死亡戰爭的代價</p>
<p>假使歐洲的惟一的飢餓之土，那末世界上的糧食危機原已是够嚴重的了，但不幸，世界的其他部分，也一樣地是一片災荒。</p>
<p>世界上百分之九十的米是產在「亞洲衣角」的幾個國家的，——緬甸，　羅和越南。中國，日本，馬來亞和印度則一向是約略地可以自給的。但今年的情形是十分悽慘。緬甸，從前是世界最大的米庫，今年所能運出的只不過十萬噸。</p>
<p>在中國，一千萬以上的人正在受著飢餓。有許多已經餓死了。在秋天收穫以前，更多的人將要餓死，因爲在這滿目瘡痍的國家裏，交通已在戰爭中受了巨大的破壞，糧食的輸給已追不上飢餓的競走了。湖北，廣西，廣東，貴州都是一片飢餓的土地，但這一切都沒有比河南更嚴重的了。在那裏，爲了要遏制一九四五年日本人最後一次的蠢動，黃河的堤口掘開了，使二百萬英畝的土地盡成澤國，這片土地是供給着三百萬中國人的糧食的。</p>
<p>但我們要明白，這樣大規模的世界饑荒，乃是大規模的世界戰爭的成果。是戰爭摧毀了農田，破壞了交通。在每一次大規模的爭鬥以後，世界看見了，戰爭的代價就是饑荒，疾病和死亡，讓我們希望，人類在下一次的戰爭爆發之前，能夠記得這個教訓吧。</p>
<h3>「玻璃」時代</h3>
<p>英美科學家曾經屢次說過：「差不多沒有一件東西不可用玻璃塑料（Plastic）製造的。」的確，你看：玻璃褲帶，玻璃雨衣，玻璃皮包，玻璃皮鞋，玻璃木梳，玻璃……要不是原子炸彈　生於此時，恐怕大家都在　著「玻璃時代」了。</p>
<p>實在「玻璃時代」確已降臨了。美國和英國工業家正在努力製造玻璃塑料，以應戰後的大量需要。</p>
<p>其實我們所見到的玻璃……，祇不過是一些奢侈品而已。中國所真正需要的不是這類奢侈品，而是用玻璃塑料製造的無線電機，電話機和電氣用具之類。</p>
<p>英國的大工廠裏正在大量製造玻璃塑料的無線電機，電話機，電缺用具，汽車零件和建築材料。許多構造複雜的零件用玻璃塑料塑成整塊的形體，製造簡便而且經久耐用。製造塑料器皿時，大抵用壓榨機壓榨而成，每方吋塑料所受的壓力有數噸至數十噸之大。有一壓榨機用每方吋七十五噸的壓力製造玻璃木梳，每小時出貨數百隻。另外一家工廠每星期生產塑料電話機和無線電收音機各數千具。有一種塑料簡直和普通的玻璃分辨不出，另外一種塑料可以用作光學玻璃。單單英國一處，從事這一種工業的工人就有四萬人之多。塑料工業發展之速，誠有一日千裏之槪。在目前它已經成爲最時髦的一種工業了。我們準備著迎接「玻璃時代」的到來！</p>
<h3>又一新發明</h3>
<p>蛀牙是一種極普通的毛病，但是對人體健康可以發生極嚴重的影響。著名牙科醫師哥脫里勃博士發明了幾種價廉的化學藥品。用這幾種藥品刷牙之後，一小時之內就可以保證你不患蛀牙，效力達百分之九十到一百。</p>
<p>這位醫生現年六十一歲，原藉奧地利，在德軍佔領該國時逃往美國。</p>
<h3>準確統計</h3>
<p>蘇軍搬走德國機器</p>
<p>蘇聯人究竟從德國蘇軍佔領區內搬走了多少工業設備？這是軍政當局以至新聞記者所極關心的問題。上星期「新聞週刊」從軍政府工業軍事管理部所提供的檔案中，獲得了比較最準確的估計，數字如下：</p>
<p>金屬工廠設備被搬走百分之五十；鹼水製造廠被搬走百分之八十；硝酸廠被搬走百分之七進；苛性鹼工廠被搬走百分之五十；其他化學工廠被搬走百分之七十五；賽璐珞工廠被搬走百分之一百；造紙廠被搬走百分之六十；煉糖廠被搬走百分之八十。</p>
<p>據說，蘇方還搬走了二千公里鐵路軌道（等於一千二百四十英里），事實上恐還不止此數。</p>
<h3>原子彈試驗成績　不如也不太壞　投彈者一失手成千古恨</h3>
<p>— 佐溪譯述</p>
<p>這次美國陸海空聯合在比基尼珊瑚島舉行原子彈轟炸試驗，各國人士對於試驗結果的批判，眾說紛紜，莫　一是。茲將美國合眾社的六位特派記者從空中和海上各方位目擊轟炸情景後，所提到的個人印象，譯述於後，以供揣摩。</p>
<p>第一位記者巴塞洛米，當原子彈降落之際，正翱翔於比基尼島的上空。他說：「從空中望過去，和當初預測的情景相差甚遠，不免使人失望。可是在第二天從低飛的飛機上俯瞰被炸目標的全景，發覺那受害的區域旣很廣大，同時損害的程度也很慘重。一般人之所以感到失望，正如一張優良的影片，事前鼓吹得太過火了，待看到時便覺得平淡無奇了」</p>
<p>第二位記者泰利搭乘合眾社專輪阿派拉將號參觀原子彈試驗，他說：「原子炸彈是可怕的，即使從二十英里以外遙望過去，也還覺得它的可怕。世界上無論何種軍器決不能發生這種鉅大的閃光，能於一擊之下沉艦五艘並損壞其他船艦四十艘之多。」</p>
<p>第三位記者邁勒乘著白蘭第中將的旗艦作壁上觀，他說：「我敢說這顆炸彈的破壞力和猛烈的情景完全符合它的一切報告，雖然比較起投在長崎的那顆炸彈來是相形見拙的。我的印象是：這次試驗在科學研究講是不很成功的，原因有二：那顆炸彈沒有擊中奈伐達號；却把載有重要儀器的軍界艦吉連號擊沉了。」</p>
<p>第四位記者彭尼霍夫說：「轟炸手伍德少校不能將炸彈投於靶子艦五百呎以內，結果使歷史上的第四顆原子炸彈不克致成十足的損害程度並供給預期的科學資料。實際上它是在半空中爆發的，這在攻擊海軍船艦的戰略上是不很高明的。」</p>
<p>第五位記者摩勒乘坐巴那敏脫觀察船觀察，他說：「心平氣和地說來，那顆炸彈的火力比較當初預期的要小得多，但是經過實地巡視礁湖以後，我對於那顆炸彈的重視隨之增強起來。根據我在日本的觀察，這顆炸彈和丟在廣島上面的那顆炸彈具有同樣的破壞力，由於那裏的建築脆弱和人煙稠密之故，表面的損失似乎大些。但是這顆炸彈似乎沒有長崎的那顆猛烈可怕」。</p>
<p>坐在阿派拉將號專輪上觀察的第六位記者說：「我對於這次試驗的所得到的印象是一種失望，因爲除了尋常的　狀烟柱外沒有其他驚人的景象。不過我相信那炸彈雖然不若理想的可怕，畢究是對付艦隊的一種猛烈的武器」。</p>

<h3>讚美詩</h3>
<p>— 梁酉廷</p>
<p>宗教與藝術，曾經結過緣。</p>
<p>誠然，宗教利用了藝術，正如豐子愷先生所說，在中世紀，音樂做了宗教的奴隸。但許多藝術也依賴着宗教而傳播。一個禮拜堂，裏面綜合了建築，彫刻，美術，詩歌（讚美詩）的藝術，來做爲佈道的工具。他們利用那堂皇的建築，雄偉的佈置，莊嚴的歌聲，使你一走進了禮拜堂，心理上便起了反應，覺得那環境的崇高與偉大，歌聲的動人，而自己彷彿越來越渺小了。這是傳教者的用心。如果就藝術的獨立性來看，當然藝術已被俘虜，做爲人家的附屬品；但在每次大戰亂後，藝術仍能傳留下來，也不能不歸功於宗教。正如音樂與文字結合後，音樂的本身成爲美麗文詞的附屬品，但沒有文學的結合，又覺得那幽婉的旋律富麗的和聲，沒有寄託了。「標題音樂」（Program.me　Music）的產生，原因亦在此。</p>
<p>所以對於宗教音樂無需敵視。我覺得那正大的旋律，沉着的節奏，的確可以潤澤一下我們的心靈。都市裏的人們終日爲名利而爭逐，神經經常地緊張，確平需要常常有機會澄清一下心靈。即使你不願意機械式地做禮拜，但如果在日常生活裏，在起身的清晨，入睡前的夜晚，能夠抽空聽或者唱一首讚美詩，一定可以使你的腦海裏有着善與美的憧憬。我們不必相信靈魂與天國，但如果你假定那壯麗的歌聲是來自遙遠的「天國」，那天國象徵著一塊聖潔的境界，那時候煩惱與痛苦交　着的心靈，將頓時安靜下來，而有着深遠的寄託。我常覺得宗教的形式很美，內容很善，我們雖不必定信奉它，但却可以常常欣賞它的美，嚮往着它的善。這其實也是to　enjoy　life的方法之一。</p>
<p>不要以爲宗教音樂是屬於宗教的，其實讚美詩的旋律，原來並非爲讚美詩而作；許多讚美詩的曲譜，本來原是名家的心血結晶或著名的民謠，是宗教家把這些藝術的精華，拿去當宗教的工具的。例如有名的讚美詩Holy　Night，其曲譜本是德國的民謠，而中國的古曲「滿江紅」，「陽關三疊」，也都被收入讚美詩集內。所以，宗教音樂，本來都是很好的音樂，不能因爲它被加上宗教的色彩而予以歧視。</p>
<p>不過有人嫌讚美詩太「千篇一律」，覺得乏味；記得，前年的音樂節，我們在后方舉行演奏會，其中有一小段宗教樂歌的合唱，聽者均不耐煩地說：「做禮拜吧！」這正等於許多人只能接受Jazz的道理一樣。當然，我也不否認聽了太多的讚美詩也會疲勞，但把它作爲你的音樂愛好節目中的一部份—也就是日常生活中的一部份，一定是很有益的。</p>
<p>讚美詩我欣賞它。</p>
<h3>悼</h3>
<p>— 姚迺予</p>
<p>雪烟，我的孩子！想不到你在受了八年的苦難以後，會匆匆地結束了你的生命。八年前的今日，我和你母親帶着未出世的你，依戀地離開了上海，而八年後，我們纔得重返家園，全家歡聚，你却悄悄地離開了人間！</p>
<p>回憶去年年底，我們回到上海，又轉回故鄉的時候，心里覺得何等徼倖，何等歡欣！苦熬了這悠長的歲月，我們終于又重見了八年來在夢中的故鄉。母親在門口迎接我們，她爲了見到兩個在想念中的孫女——你和你的妹妹冰芝，把將流出的眼淚又咽下去，隨着，你羞澀地叫了聲奶奶，使母親喜歡得將你抱起來，用乾枯的手摩撫着你，忘了八年來在敵人鐵蹄下所身受的磨難，痛苦，和一切的創傷，孩子，我私自爲你慶幸，也爲母親祝福。</p>
<p>你在鄉間住了四個多月，主要的是爲了我在上海找不到房子，但鄉村的生活，對你那瘦弱的身軀是有益的。學校開學了，你進了故鄉的小學校。你開始認識那些陌生的小朋友，也認識了那些的鄉人的臉。你那間有的聰敏，溫馴的性格，博得了每個人的喜愛和稱許。孩子！故鄉是保留著十八世紀淳樸的舊風的，人們都勤儉做事，不大愛管人家的事，尤其是一個別人家的女孩子，更不屑一談。可是，孩子，你却像在故鄉平靜的湖面上投了一把西砂，激起了一陣綺麗的漣漪。你牽動了他（她）們古老的神經，使他（她）們每天化上些時間來談論你，你造成了故鄉的一個奇蹟。</p>
<p>故鄉和上海相離咫尺，每逢星期日，我有暇使坐了自行車回去看你們，你總像平日我工畢回家的時候一樣，携了冰芝的手，邊跳邊　着爸爸來歡迎我；當我離家的時候，你你又揚著手高喊著「爸爸再見」。你好像很高興，對故鄉的生活似乎也很滿足。但你的母親告訴我，你常會偸偸地問你媽媽：「爸爸找到房子了沒有？」或是「爸爸怎麼還沒找到房子？」孩子，我明白你的心理，你雖然爲故鄉所歡迎，所頌讚，你的心却常常飛到我的身旁。我於是更盡力四處託人，找尋房子，終於在上月初找到了。十二日那天，我從鄉間把你們接到上海來，爲了學校的功課，行前我曾試着讓你在故鄉讀完這學期，但你無論如何不願意，我也不忍過拂你的意思，因爲你從沒離開過我啊！誰知你到上海才十天就病了。你的病，西醫說是慢性腦膜炎—無藥可治的絕症！中醫說是濕溫症，爲你開方醫治，究也無效，你終於離開了我。我後悔幾個月的奔走，竟斷送你的小生命！</p>
<p>你彌留的時候，我最後一次也是永遠地送你回到故鄉。多少喜愛你的人來看望你，多少喜愛你的人流着眼淚，呼喚着你的名字，而你那雙明亮的眸子已不會再閃動，不復再辨認那些曾是陌生而成親暱的臉龐了；你那薄薄的嘴唇，不會再嬌柔地叫一聲爸爸了。六月八日的十二時五十分，你呼吸了最後的一口呼吸！</p>
<p>孩子！你去了。你靜靜地睡在木板上，芳妹替你施好脂粉，穿上了你所喜歡的紅色的旗袍；她又爲你梳理一頭長長而烏黑的髮絲，編結成兩只光潔的小辮，打上紅綢的蝴蝶結，像你第一次回到故鄉的時候一樣，你還是那樣娟美，那麼玲瓏。孩子啊！誰說你已死去呢？我疑惑是自己的神經失常了。我撲上來想吻你一下，被圍着的人拖了開去。有人正在焚化你的衣服，火光熊熊，照澈屋內。我睇視着那可怕的火，它燃燒着你的漂亮的衣服，也燃燒着我的心，但却燃燒不起你的心臟的跳動。</p>
<p>我坐在東廂房的門檻上，呆望着你烏黑可愛的小辮，那裏面藏着八年來的故事，一幕幕地在我眼前顯映。你生長在海邊的山城，那遼闊的海面，柔滑的沙灘，是你常常戀念着的。我們在那裏曾經捱過了三年零十個月的借貸生活；其後，我們跨過了四個省份，九個大城，曾經在長江的渡船上，人人爭渡，爲了你的安全，我破例跟人吵架，幾乎動武；爲了沒有食糧，你曾經啃食花生餅充飢，反而使你餓了兩日；在一個大城中不同的地點，我和你同時遭受到空中的襲擊，結果幸無傷害；你曾經爲我被敵人鞭笞而暗暗流淚，不讓我知道；你爲了過度的受驚而有時心悸，有時失眠；你……孩子，這一切不堪回憶的往事，你又讓我重溫—將永遠在悲痛中，一遍又一遍地重溫了啊！</p>
<p>孩子，學校放晚學了，你的小朋友都荷着書包，打我家的門前經過，哭聲驚動了他們，他們都好奇地停住了腳步，擎着書包，抬頭向裏看望。孩子，我爲你打開了你的書包：兩本學校發給你的教科書而外，有着我新近買給你的一只筆盒和一個洋娃娃；抄費薄上的第一頁，你抄着「孫中山先生的故鄉是……」，那本算術簿上有着我最後爲你所出的算題。我彷彿看見你的手在揮動，在簿子上書寫。但你的手畢竟不再揮動了。你被捺入那只帶走人間歡笑的木盒。我將你的書包輕輕地放在你的身旁，我苦苦呼叫你，孩子，你却不再道聲「爸爸再見」了！</p>
<p>孩子，你去了！你的死，對於這世界也許是漠然的；但對於我是一個不可彌縫的傷痕。你帶走了你的智慧，你的溫馴，你也帶走了你在故鄉造成的奇蹟。八年的偎依，隨着你生命的結束而結束。但是，我將永遠記着這一切，永遠記着這一切，永遠記着你！</p>
<h3>母與子</h3>
<p>— 謝紫</p>
<p>「他若是牆，我們要在其上建造銀塔，他若是門，我們要用香柏木板圍護他……」這段話對我格外熟稔，約模是兩年以前吧，有一天我們已作完了晚　，母親突然把舊約雅歌一章打開來，要我把作有印記的地方讀給她聽，並要我試着来講解，可是我從沒有看過這一章，我不想聖經裏會有這樣的文字呢！</p>
<p>「我真的不懂。母親。」我不好意思的說，「而且我也不需要懂呢！」</p>
<p>「不，你要懂的。否則你也不懂我是怎樣的愛護你了。」她輕輕的微笑着——這是怎樣一種溫柔的嚴肅啊．「親愛的孩子」，她用手輕撫着我的髮，讓我俯伏在她膝上。「前天夜晚我到你房裏去看你。你不知道吧？」</p>
<p>「前天夜晚？是不是下大雨的那一晚呢。母親？」</p>
<p>「是的。就因爲下雨很冷我才想着去你的。怎麼你連窗子也不關，燈也沒有熄。是不是你在不想睡着的時候。已經睡着了」？她停了一下又說。「那天夜晚你有沒有作過什麼夢呢，我的梅？」</p>
<p>我抬起眼來看看母親，也正微笑的盯着我。</p>
<p>「沒有，」我說，「我記不清了。」</p>
<p>「我却還替你記着呢！那是不是一個很惱人的夢？唉！當我去給你蓋被的時候。你簡直是個淚人兒呢，你的眼角上掛滿了淚珠。連臥枕也給你弄濕了一半，當時我很想喚醒你，問問你到底是怎麼一回事。或者至少可以使你從惱人的夢境裏解脫。可是想了一下。我還是不那樣了。我知道這不會有什麼旁的緣故的。你一直是養在一個澄明的家庭裏啊？」說到這兒。她的聲音簡直溫柔到有如耳語。「當你在襁褓中的時候。我就猜着你是個多情的女兒了。可是。我兒啊，這種性格，加在母親的愛情上固然會變作憐惜。加在母親的責任上，却變成一個沈重的擔子了。」</p>
<p>我默然俯伏着，好像一個三兩歲的孩子，我覺得自從那天以後，母親對我格外親切了。實在不止是親切，我該怎樣說呢？我看到過好多人的家庭，在那兒都像是沒有陽光的。而我，我是在作夢嗎？我在人世上能享有這麼綿密的愛？</p>
<p>剛才母親又來過的。「你還沒有睡？」她輕聲的訝異着。</p>
<p>「我在想着你，母親」在這種心心相印的時刻，我簡直有點楚楚欲啼了。「哥哥剛回來。他說他想來看看你的。我告訴他你已經睡了。沒想到你却在這兒凝想呢！可是你也該睡了呀。母親，」我藹然的說，「你看月光已經照滿窗幃了！」</p>
<h3>二個母親</h3>
<p>— 中原</p>
<p>最近看見一個四十餘歲篤信上帝的母親，寫信給她的獨生兒子。那兒子已經二十歲，身強力壯，在某大學讀書，這天忽然寄一封快信回家，說是已考入某某軍隊，不久即將出國訓練。那位母親鎮靜地把兒子的信讀了幾遍，立刻寫一封回信給兒子，她這樣寫着：</p>
<p>「若是你是去救人愛人，你就是飄流到天涯海角，永不回來，我也決不會捨不得你，可是你是去訓練殺人，訓練流人血的勾當，我覺得這不是上帝的旨意，我要用全力來阻擋你！」</p>
<p>看到這個母親，不由得使人想起另外一個母親，就是那故事書上很著名的斯巴達婦人：從前斯巴達與別國戰爭的時候，有一個婦人，先把大兒子送上戰塲，不久戰死了，惡耗傳來，她一點不悲傷，立刻把第二個兒子送上戰塲，不久也戰死了，她仍舊不悲傷，再把第三個兒子送上戰塲，可是不久第三個兒子也戰死了，這一次惡耗傳來時，那婦人號啕大哭，人家問她爲什麼這一次如此悲傷，她答道：「我一共只有三個兒子，如今都死了，我已沒有兒子再可以爲國家作戰犧牲了！」</p>
<p>二個母親，一個酷愛和平，反對流血，一個勇敢愛國，不怕犧牲，我們不能否認她們都是偉大的。不過是非觀念，因時因地而異，像現在這種世界裏，當然是斯巴達的母親來得更偉大了。否則，你愛和平，你怕殺人流血，而阻擋兒子去從軍；人家卻不愛和平，不怕殺人流血，而鼓勵兒子來打你，那你不是只好坐以待斃嗎？</p>
<p>但事實雖如此，我們理想不妨有一個吧。</p>
<p>我常常閉着眼睛理想着：假使有一天，全世界的每一個母親，都像這個酷愛和平反對流血的母親一樣，用全力來阻擋兒子從軍，那麼，將成功一個何等幸福可愛的世界呢！</p>

<h3>雙宿雙飛　（十八）</h3>
<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>麗華如今不僅是在戲園子的地位高了起來，在家裏的地位也高了起。關於她掙來的利益方面的事，她是不聞不問，一切都由墨太太經手。但關於她私人的行動方面的事，墨太太却不能過分的聞問。比如她喜歡看書；她不願意出去應酬；這些墨太太都不得干涉她。這個最低限度的權利，是她所爲墨太太掐來的利益換得的，也是她近年來的生活上的一點進步。她已不像從前，全部任憑墨太太支配，她是一個被支配的傀儡。如今，她總算是由墨太太的手心，又贖回了一部分「自己」，墨太太多少還要遷就了她？她變得緘默之外，嚴肅，莊重！無論在戲園子裏；在家裏；她不大理那些七分像鬼，三分像人的同行；也很少理張弦和墨太太；甚而麗雲。她在台上是爲了「義務」，有哭；有笑；有說；有唱；下了台，她就是不開口的啞巴。別人把她無可奈何，也不敢奈何。這又是她精神上的一點進步，她能夠使人們對她起了尊敬！</p>
<p>唯獨張弦這小子還不改舊病，常常嬉皮笑臉想逗逗麗華。因爲他仗着他是麗華的師父，麗華不能罵他。又仗着麗華需要他拉胡琴，麗華不能離開他。因此，別人怕麗華，他不怕！別人尊敬麗華，他不尊敬！這使麗華非常痛苦，幾次向墨太太交涉，辭卸了張弦，可是墨太太不肯，墨太太知道麗華的一半成功是要靠着這把胡琴的。但若麗華氣急了，向墨太太威脅不再唱了的時候，墨太太也會輕輕用好言勸戒張弦幾句。張弦知道麗華的脾氣，也不敢十分去惹她，却也絕不對這朶含苞未放的好花，輕易死了心！</p>
<p>就這樣，麗華在說平靜，而又不平靜的生活環境中，度過了第十四個年頭。忽然北京市面起了異乎尋常的騷動，接着兵荒馬亂，人心惶了！幾天之後，烽火連天，炮聲隆隆！</p>

<h3>新聞補白</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>宋院長的記者招待會上，有若干地方，新聞中語焉不祥，茲作一補充。</p>
<p>宋院長說：我主持中國銀行九年，從未引用過一個私人，大家不相信，可以調查。我認為他們能奉公守法，勤懇所職，就是我的人。以勝利後設立的三個敵偽產業處理局局長而論，劉功芸從前係中國銀行同事，當時他還反對我，現在我仍然用他，因為他廉潔，勇敢，肯做事，負責任；孫越崎和林繼庸，事前我決不認識，有人說他們好，我就用他們，直到他們接事才見面。</p>
<p>宋院长說：公教人員的確太苦了，他們當中，最好的一等人是變賣衣特來維持生活，第二等人發牢騷，發牢騷的也是好人。還有一等人，那就是舞弊了。</p>
<p>宋院長說：日本投降當時共有三百五十萬錠子，原有的紗廠已陷入無法經營的窘境，明知接收過來將來紗價一定高漲，政府為什麼把這些錠子出賣，而讓少數人獲暴利呢？政府沒有這個義務。與其讓少數暴利，無寧使它對國家財政有貢獻。</p>
<p>記者會採取對號入座的辦法，席上有香烟，點心，和咖啡。一個問題接着一個問題，詢問者很踴躍，很熱烈。詢問者剛坐下，宋院長即立刻站起答覆，迅速，直率，也很誠摯。場面的確動人。要不是宋院長還有其它事務，延長下去，怕會到天黑還不得罷休。</p>
<h3>米呢？</h3>
<p>— 時靖</p>
<p>記得吳市長在清華校友會上說過：我參加一次校友會，米的風潮就抑平一次。這次米的風潮已鬧有一個多星期了還未見賢明的市長拿出抑平的方法來，我想這定是清華校友會還未曾開會的緣故吧！不然的話，米的風潮老早就抑平了。</p>
<p>市府配給米糧給米店是事實（報載七月五日市府配給米店越七千包）；上海各大小米店開着店門，店裏顆粒米也沒有已有一個多星期了也是事實；老百姓拿了國家銀行發行出來的鈔票，至米店裏固然買不到米，就是街頭巷尾偶而有一些米販負了幾斗米，也在物希為貴你爭我奪之下一哄而賣光，其價格要超過價一倍有奇，尤非我輩窮措大所能垂涎，而且這種情形，不是每日都有的形成了有錢買不到米的畸形現象，這更加是事實，老百姓在恐慌着將來會有無米吃的一日，因為我們倒底是中國人應吃中國的大米飯，而不能改變日常生活方式去吃西餐呀，這問題實在太嚴重了。我們市民不能不大聲的喊了：「敢問市長米到那裏去了」！</p>
<h3>電報七十年</h3>

<p>我國之有電報設備，至今尚不及七十年，敷設電綫，始於淞滬綫，經營其事者為丹麥商行之大北電報公司。清同治十三年，兩江總督沈葆奏陳電報之利。但以故未能實行。實際上中國之有自設電報路綫，則在光緒二年。是年李鴻章架設由天津達大沽北塘砲台之電綫，此為中國自辦電服之始。</p>
<p>電報進入中國，乃在同治光緒年間，主其事者為丹麥大北電報公司。其時中外海運已通，國外新奇事物，陸續傳抵中國；洋槍火砲固為前所未知者，即洋龍（救火車）火油以及煤氣之類，亦皆目為新奇事物。至於電報傳郵，更被認為鬼神作怪不可思議之事。大北電報線行內，通報成功後，初刊告於光緒二年之七十年前申報。文曰：「近年西法之巧，無過於電報者，以重洋數萬里，尋常寄信，數月始達，今立時即可飛致。倘千百里之遙，則頃刻便可有回音也。故各國皆設電信，在朝廷則飛報機密重事，在商買則飛報貨物行情，實為至妙至要之法。……」當時各種西學尚示流傳中國，故對電服一物，衆皆以「順風耳」視之。</p>
<p>大北電報公司係屬於丹麥京師電報公司，五口通商條約簽訂前後，在中國日本通商口岸數設電綫，在其所刊之廣告中，指明「吳淞海口·蛇山海島·廈門·香港·越南·新加坡·新金山·（即今墨爾本）長崎·橫濱·神戶·箱館·以至印度·歐羅巴·亞美利加·均可通達。該公司為便利華人通報計，並延攪專人，編成電碼一書，此亦有廣告可證。其文云：「本公司現已造成華字電報書一本，便於華人通曉其事。其中用法，以數目字代中國字。此書存於本公司並各處分館。凡欲寄電信來館者，即贈書一冊，並可詳言其妙。另有送信遠近價目單，庶可一覧而知也。」</p>
<p>迄光緒六年，李鴻章又奏請指撥餉銀十七萬八千七百兩，開辦南北洋電報，敷設上海天津綫，並天津·大沽·濟寗·清江·鎮江·蘇州·上海等電報局七所。是年十二月二十四日，全綫開始通報，光緒八年，復沿揚子江引一綫向西行，由鎮江·南京·經蕪湖而至漢口，費時二年、始告工竣。十年一月，復延長興香港接通，同年十月上海廣州綫亦由青廷建設。北方則由天津展至北京，一面展至山海關及保定，並由濟南引二支綫達芝罘及青島。此均光緒十年事也。迨光緒二十三年，由北京橫斷蒙古抵恰克圖之綫築成，我國陸地通至歐洲之綫路於此乃告完成。</p>
<p>國府奠都南京後，次年夏全國統一，召開全國交通會議，鋻於大北，大江，太平洋三水綫公司歷年來之設施及所訂合同內容至為不公，歷經折衝，（合同於十九年十二月三十一日期滿）將三公司收發處實行接收，至此中國電信局遂告統一。總計中國電信事業，自創設以迄於今，為時尚不及七十年，現今不特全國均已可以通報，即無綫電台及廣播電台亦已各地林立，其發達不能為不速。惟今日英美各國無綫電傳影無綫電影片，已由實騐而入營業時期，尚望國人急起直追，庶免處處遠落人後也。……」</p>
<h3>上海騐妓之始</h3>
<p>— 溪居</p>
<p>報載滬市娼妓，驚局業已令飭登記，同時據方另一消息，謂駐滬美軍患花柳病者，人數激增，函請我政府協助解決此一問題。回憶二三月前、何處欽在報告中亦曾提及軍中性病問題見嚴重，促請各方注意。據悉上海衛生當局為防止性病蔓延，消極方面對於本市娼妓將加緊檢騐工作，積極方面正計劃添設性病醫院，以期撲滅花柳病菌。</p>
<p>上海公娼制度始於何時，已不可攷，但工部局創議騐妓，則遠在光緒二年丙子六月五日。據是年六月十三日申報載：「月之初五日，本埠工部局聚議，不特商人在內，即麥領事與水師提督暨工部業水師醫生亦皆與會，其所議者以妓女或受淫毒，難免不傳染於人，須開設一館，延醫生逐人騐看，無毒則從之，為娼有毒，則收其牌，令在醫館調治，俟愈後再行接客。此舉在香港已有之，大約一切章程均相彷佛也。以鄙見測之，當事為「鹹水妹」（注：專家接外國水兵這妓女）起見，誠恐水手與之狎暱，或受毒瘡，未能於行間出力耳」據謂工部局當時並未令「書庽」「長三」「么二」「花烟間」亦須逐一檢騐，理由顯為上述妓女之嫖客均為華人，與洋人無涉，採取放任政策，該文末段又謂：設此等「書庽」「長三」「么二」「花烟間」亦欲逐人檢點，則未免羣雌粥粥，滿面妖羞矣。現議先行試辦，俟看經費約需幾何，再行定奪。」</p>
<p>同月十五日申報對於騐妓一事撰評論述，謂：「西醫騐妓，在華人視之，殊形穢褻，然西人視之，頗為美舉。查十餘年前，泰西各國，每謂人之情慾本屬天性，茍恣意而行，無所節制，則不免災及其身，此自作之孽而天因之以示儆，原不必國家興聞也。嗣因國家詳加查察，凡為娼妓者閱人較多，受毒必重，一經水手兵役等人與之狎暱傳染，小者生瘡發毒，大者傷生絕嗣，庸愚無知，情殊可憫。故特明定章程，設局派醫騐看，遇有受病妓女，為之加意診治，一俟醫愈，仍即發回，倘或其間有不願復為娼者，局中代為擇配從良，妓女因此脫籍而得離火坑者正復不少。現在西國各口仿照辦理，均各悉臻妥善，此舉匪特娼妓多獲保全，即軍民亦同受裨益，刻下工部局倡議舉辦，正屬實事求是，默寓生成之美意，願聞見者勿以怪事晒之。」</p>
<p>目前我國對於娼妓問題，中央未有明確政策之規定，若干城市採取放任政策，但亦有都會賣行禁娼者。吾人姑不論二者孰為得策，而檢騐娼妓之舉，不僅事屬合理，且實有此必要。戰後世界各國，均患性病猖獗，我國雖無切確統計，然其蔓延之廣，且已遍及窮鄉僻野矣。設不急予撲滅，今後民族健康堪虞，故檢騐娼妓不惟為當務之急，且應全國倣行，庶幾可免絕種敗族之虞也。</p>

<h3>月球旅行</h3>
<p>— 東方荊</p>
<p>遠在「雷達」還沒有和月球接觸之前，美國已有一千多個人計劃到月球上去旅行了。這些遠見的人們，隸屬於「美國火箭社」——一個不以牟利為目的的團體；一九四二年時，創建於伊利諾州。會員包括工程師，天文學家，化學家，及其他科學家，職業的和業於的都有。是全世界最龐大的「火箭熱」團體。</p>
<p>據該社副社長過去的估計，一架火箭船旅行到月球上，約需二千五百萬美金。現在應用原子能，所費已減低到三十萬美金。原子能能並將減少燃料的供應，以便裝載更多的船員及其他儀器。</p>
<p>這個團體認為，在戰後的今日，月球旅行，不信一定能夠如願以償。我們且等着瞧這一奇蹟的實現吧！</p>

<p>是一個人，總或多或少地喜歡着人們的諂諛，程度難免自然是依個性而參諛，好惡也依個性而不同。</p>

<p>不過，無論諂諛人家，或是被人家諂諛，可受可諛之間，自已總應該有適當的權衡，否則，也一定會被人訕笑了。</p>

<h3>寄給亡婦鳳君（二）</h3>
<p>— 周瘦鵑</p>
<p>這一個農暦新年，我並沒有好好度過，一方面忙着檢點東西，作遷蘇的凖備；一方面暗中憂着你的病，偶然出外遇見了親友，總以此為談話的題材，希冀博得他們的同情和慰藉，而他們的見解也正和程醫師一模一樣，因此我的心就放寬了一些，滿以為回到了蘇州，你就可以慢兒的脫離病魔的魔手了。可是我們的故園環境幽靜，花木茂美，空氣和陽光都很充足，正是一個天造地設的療養院，你回去休養麼一二個月，一面打針服藥，積極療治，病魔雖兇，也得知難而退；你也很為樂觀，只等候度過了元宵節，就可以重見山溫水軟的蘇州了。</p>
<p>到得家具付物全都運上了船之後，我們就在十八日那天早上動身了，錚兒小夫婦倆和葆妹母子都預定伴送到蘇；老友劉漢君少將知道了，先派員上火車去佔好了幾個頭等座位，隨又派一位上尉用吉普車來接我們，這樣的厚誼，真使我感激得很！這天天氣並不冷，却刮着一些兒風，你雖穿着厚駝絨的大衣，還怕你受不住，我把圍巾圍住了你的口鼻和勃子，更把大帕子裹住了你的頭，一路上問你冷不冷，舒服不舒服？你總微笑着回說不冷，很舒服，安我的心。上火車時，由媳婦扶着你走了好一段路，你走得很快，也並不氣喘；在車上和我相對而坐，隨時有說有笑，很為高興。到了蘇州站下了火車，仍由媳婦扶着你走了好一段路，方出車站，隨又坐了二十分鐘顛顛頓頓的人力車到達家裏，你那清瘦的臉上仍還掛着一絲微笑，說是並不覺得累；我料知你為了重見闊別八年的故園，所以情不自禁的樂而忘倦了。</p>
<p>第二天，我忙去訪問幾位醫友，地愛克司光照片給他們瞧，都說情形不算嚴重，且把鈣和維他命BC三種針藥注射起來，於是由那位退休的龐醫師介紹了鄰近一位年青的吳醫師給我，間日來注射一次，以鈣維他命C注射肌肉，那時你每天的熱度進升時降，高則比常人超出二度，低則超出一度，總沒有退盡的時光，起初並不瞞你，使你焦慮得甚麼似的，可是我也沒有法兒安慰你。過了半個多月，老友程小青兄弟回蘇州來了，聽說你熱度未退，主張該注射空氣針，他的夫人和他那位曾患肺病而尚在休養的世兄育德也以為非打空氣針不可，光是注射鈣等三種針藥是沒有用的，事到如今，再也不容躭誤了。我很感激老友的熱情，就請他替你在博習醫院中定了個頭等病房，過一天他們院中執事就把擔架來抬去了。我在家留守，由那個在我家工作了二十多年的葉媽主持家務，讓葆妹在醫院中陪伴你，以免寂莫。過了兩天，就由黃醫師給你在右肺上注射了空氣針，我在旁觀戰兢兢地瞧着，你的臉色變得很難看，似乎胸部很窒悶，醫師去後，你還說：「悶極了，悶極了，怎的透不氣來？」我着了慌，忙去問醫師，據說這是注射後應有的現家，一會兒就沒有甚麼了。過了十多分鐘，果然逐漸復原狀，那時我很樂觀，因為曾聽得育德說，空氣針倘打得進，那麼一逕打下去，定可以肺部打癌，病菌沒有法活動了；我把這話安慰你，彼此都有了喜色。你在醫院中住着我天天早上總來探望你，在你病牀旁邊的方兒上供了一個藍地白花的長型花瓶，見園中有甚麼花，就採甚麼花來讓你欣賞，從綠梅換到白玉蘭一朶朶向董你姹婭欲笑。而一轉眼已住滿半個月了，每隔三天注射一次空氣針，左右兩肺已各注兩次，並且間日仍注射鈣等三種針藥，外加比荷苛靈針也注射了四次，一面還服着醫院中的藥水，每天總是三四次。查是不知怎的，你的熱度還是時升時降，沒有多大進步，我只得請護士們帶着我撒謊，對你說熱度已退盡了。鳳，你得體諒我的苦衰，我的斯騙你，全為了要使伯寬心啊！</p>

<h3>CCP Plans to Launch Full-Scale Internal Strife; All Deployments Completed; Held Military Conference to Appoint Commanders-in-Chief for Each Route; Communist Troops in Northern Jiangsu Prepare for War, Reaching Fever Pitch</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 9th] It is learned that the Communist army has already completed deployments to launch a full-scale internal strife. The Communist Party leaders convened a military conference in late June, deciding everything and appointing Nie Rongzhen as Commander-in-Chief for the attack on Taiyuan, Liu Bocheng as Commander-in-Chief for the Pinghan Railway Line, Chen Yi as Commander-in-Chief for the Jinpu Railway Line, Su Ke as Commander-in-Chief for the attack on the Xiji-East Hebei-Jehol area, Yao Zhe as Commander-in-Chief for the attack on Datong, Yang Chengwu and Chen Geng as Commanders-in-Chief for the encirclement of Beiping and Tianjin, Li Zhinian as Commander-in-Chief for the Henan-Hubei-Anhui Border Region, Li Dongchao as Commander-in-Chief for the Shandong-Jiangsu-Henan-Anhui Border Region, He Long as Commander-in-Chief for the Joint Defense of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-Suiyuan-Chahar Five Provinces, and Xiang Fei as Air Force Commander.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 9th] The Communist troops in Northern Jiangsu are extremely busy preparing for war, reaching a fever pitch. It is learned that between Donghai and Xuzhou, and from Xuzhou north to Pukou, effectively up to Shaobo, there are gatherings of 70,000 to 80,000 Communist troops in each location. Especially south of Shaobo, around the Grand Canal dikes, martial law is in effect, with landmines extensively laid, cutting off pedestrian traffic. Furthermore, Li Yimin, Chairman of the Communist Party's Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region government, accompanied by Liu Ze, commander of the Communist 9th Regiment, Huang Yisan, commander of the 25th Regiment, and about thirty attendants, traveled from Huaiyin by small speed boat to the Gaoyou-Shaobo area on the 8th to inspect and convene a secret military conference of cadres.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 9th] After launching a major offensive into Northern Jiangsu, the Communist army is now actively expanding its areas of encroachment. Haimen, surrounded by the Communist army, faces a critical situation, with Communist troops continuing to advance fiercely towards the city from all sides. Three divisions transferred from the south have arrived in the Huaiyin, Gaoyou, and Dongtai area, joining the Communist forces there and rapidly advancing towards Luhe and Lai'an on the 6th. The 3rd Division of the Communist army crossed Gaoyou Lake from Gaoyou in the afternoon and landed at Lingtangqiao, continuing its fierce advance towards the east of Luhe. The 2nd Division of the Communist army advanced to the vicinity of Lai'an on the 7th, with subsequent units continuing to follow. The Communist forces gathered in the area between Fengxian, Pei County, Dangshan, and Yongcheng number about 20,000 and are pressing towards Dangshan, attempting to cut off traffic on the Longhai Railway. The puppet troops under Hao Pengju, incorporated by the Communist army, have also advanced to Baitabu and Shahezhen and are continuing to press towards Donghai.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Repulsed in Zao Yang; Xinye Falls; Situation in Yicheng Unclear; Communist Troops Gather North of the Zhang River in Southern Tianjin</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 9th] The Communist forces under Li Xiannian of the Central Plains Military Region have been fiercely attacking Zao Yang in successive waves for days, and fighting is in progress. The Communist troops who infiltrated near Qingtai, 15 kilometers north of Zao Yang, were resisted by local villagers for looting grain.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 9th] The "Central Plains Military Region" of the Communist army launched a large-scale offensive on June 29th, and it has continued for ten days until the 8th. The Wen Jianwu column and parts of the Wang Shusheng column, which invaded northern Hubei, fiercely attacked Suiyangdian, Zaolin Store, and Liuti, attempting to seize Zao Yang, but were repulsed by the National Army. The Wang Shusheng column of the Communist army, which crossed the Xiang River to invade Xuancheng, has increased reinforcements to besiege the city, and the situation there is unclear. At the same time, the Liu Bocheng column of the Communist army also gathered 80,000 troops in northern Henan and launched a large-scale offensive, fiercely attacking Tangyin, Wuzhi, and Wenxian in separate directions. Observers here believe that the simultaneous large-scale offensive launched by the Li Xiannian and Liu Bocheng columns towards various places in Hubei and Henan clearly marks the opening of their full-scale internal strife.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 9th] Over 20,000 Communist troops who have been harassing southern Henan and northern Hubei are trending towards joining forces on the west bank of the Laokou and Xiang Rivers. Mengjialou, 60 li north of Laokou, was found to be occupied by Communist troops on the morning of the 9th. The vanguard unit of Li Xiannian, the Wang Shusheng column, also infiltrated from Yicheng towards Cihe and Gucheng on the 8th. One unit of the First Column under Li Xiannian's command infiltrated from Guotan, 70 li north of Zao Yang, on the 8th; one unit captured Xinye on the morning of the 8th; one unit infiltrated Goulinji, 40 li south of Deng County; and another unit infiltrated Shayan, 70 li south of Nanyang, crossed the Bai River from Fanji on the afternoon of the 8th, and infiltrated Jitan, over 60 li east of Deng County.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 9th] The Communist troops on the Zhengtai Railway are actively withdrawing southward. The Zhengtai Railway has been restored to peace. The 5th Brigade of the Communist army, which previously attacked Niangziguan, has withdrawn to Gaoyi, trending towards the Zhang River. The Communist troops in Yuanshi have also withdrawn to the vicinity of the Zhang River, seemingly intending to concentrate heavy troops near the Zhang River to prevent the National Army from opening up the Pinghan Railway.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 9th] Qingxian in the northern section of the Jinpu Railway is still surrounded by the Communist army. Communist troops are also harassing the vicinity of Maguan. A rail repair train heading north from Cangxian reached Xingji on the 9th. A rail repair train heading south is currently working in Chen Guantun. Zhaopo, 15 hua li southeast of Xiaocangxian, was captured by the Communist army on the 6th, and they are currently attacking the city walls.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 9th] The seven columns under the jurisdiction of the Communist army's Jin-Ji-Yu Military Region (each column has three brigades, and each brigade has three regiments), plus about 100,000 Communist troops from southern Hebei and northern Henan, are gathering on the north bank of the Zhang River.</p>
<h3>Lu Han, Sun Liren, etc., Arrive in Shenyang; Dai Berleman Flies to Changchun Today; Arrangement for Du Yuming-Lin Biao Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 9th] Shenyang is once again a gathering place for military stars. Generals Lu Han and Sun Liren have both newly arrived in Shenyang to discuss matters with Du Yuming. Rumors of a reorganization of the Northeast institutions are again rampant. Whether Du Yuming and Lin Biao can meet as scheduled without postponement remains to be seen, but it is a fact that both official and Communist sides here do not attach importance to this meeting. However, some minor local issues may be resolved. It is heard that the government side is prepared to propose at the Du-Lin-Dai meeting that the Communist army not destroy the small county's telephone and telegraph lines to Shenyang and release the captured personnel in Changchun. Dai Berleman is still staying here today and will fly to Changchun tomorrow to arrange the Du-Lin meeting. Officials have given a very relaxed explanation for Dai's visit to Beiping, saying that he is returning to Beiping to request clothing and food rations from the American side of the Executive Headquarters for replenishments.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 9th] Recently, there have been rumors of the Communist army withdrawing from Harbin. After reporters inquired with military and political authorities, all stated that they had not received official information on this and would wait for the facts to prove it.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] Regarding the mission of Army Commander-in-Chief Gu Zhutong to the Northeast, the reporter interviewed Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi, who replied: Mr. Gu's trip is just a routine inspection and he will return to Nanjing in a short time.</p>
<h3>Beiping Establishes Air Defense Department; Emphasizes Training of the Public</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 9th] The Beiping Air Defense Headquarters was established on July 1st. Personnel assignments are still pending. The address will be located in Zhongnanhai inside the Yintai. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Hu Bohan told reporters: All countries in the world have air defense headquarters, and China cannot be an exception. Therefore, the headquarters is of a permanent nature. The primary task of the department is to focus on training the public.</p>
<h3>Railway Between Beiping and Taiyuan is Open</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 9th] The railway between Beiping and Taiyuan is now open without obstruction. All stations on the Pinghan and Zhengtai lines have resumed joint passenger and freight transport. Many independent merchants are traveling back and forth. However, all stations are prohibited from transporting food out of the area. Except for military transport, coal from Jingxing is not allowed to be freely transported out. The Military Mediation Department has not been able to take effective measures to restore Pinghan Railway traffic. The Railway Bureau is now making preparations for road repairs and has ordered all stations to dismantle and transport unimportant branch lines in preparation for construction southward from Shijiazhuang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 8th] The western section of the Jiaoji Railway was repaired to Puji on the 7th and is continuing to be repaired eastward, with the goal of achieving full operation soon. The traffic train between Jinan and Zao Yang Temple is scheduled to extend to Mingshui starting on the 9th.</p>
<h3>Political Atmosphere in the Capital Still Quiet; Chairman Receives Xu Yongchang; Marshall Exchanges Views with Chen Cheng and Wang Shijie</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] It is heard that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek summoned General Xu Yongchang, the government representative to the Military Three-Person Committee, today and gave instructions.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] The political atmosphere remains quiet. Spokespersons said this afternoon that a meeting of the Three-Person Committee might be convened tonight, but as of midnight, there had been no such development.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 9th] Special Envoy Marshall met with Wang Shijie, Chen Cheng, and Shao Lizi today to exchange views. The results of the meeting were not announced. This was the only important meeting in the capital today.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] In view of the mediation of the Central Plains war, Marshall specially dispatched a special plane to Hankou today to invite the American and Communist representatives in the Executive Team in Hankou to Nanjing. They arrived at 3 pm and will report to Marshall within days to provide a basis for Marshall's mediation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] A reporter learned from responsible government sources that the so-called Five-Person Committee is a misnomer. The representatives of the government and the Communist Party are only exchanging views temporarily. Rumors that subsequent discussions will be held in this fixed format are incorrect.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 8th] A Communist Party spokesman announced today that the situation is extremely critical for two reasons: first, peace talks have completely stalled, and second, fighting has broken out in various places. The government is equally pessimistic. Zhou Enlai met with Chairman Chiang and government representatives three times. The government resolutely refused the Communist Party's request to retain local governments in the areas from which the Communist army withdraws, with no hope of compromise. Therefore, Zhou has given up direct negotiations with the government. A Kuomintang spokesman said that this deadlock has existed since the beginning of June, and despite various efforts, it has not been broken.</p>
<h3>Luo Longji Visits Marshall; Democratic League to Hold Meeting in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] Luo Longji, a representative of the Democratic League, visited Special Envoy Marshall at around 11:00 am this morning to discuss unresolved political issues in the Five-Person Committee talks and exchange views on breaking the current deadlock. He left after about an hour. Luo took the night train to Shanghai tonight.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] It is learned that the Democratic League plans to hold a meeting in Shanghai. Luo Longji was scheduled to take the night train from Nanjing to Shanghai last night. Huang Yanpei, Zhang Bojun, Shen Junru, and other members of the Democratic League in Shanghai will begin discussions as soon as the representatives from Nanjing, Luo Longji, Zhang Shenfu, and Liang Shuming, arrive in Shanghai. At that time, a compromise solution to the Kuomintang-Communist Party issue will be collectively drafted and offered to both sides.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 9th] Representatives of the Democratic League attending the Political Consultative Conference will meet in Shanghai tomorrow to hear a report from Democratic League spokesman Luo Longji on the current situation, so there is hope that the political deadlock will be broken. According to Luo, he requested to meet with Marshall this morning in order to obtain the best information. After I go to Shanghai to report on the current situation, I will discuss whether the Democratic League can propose a proposal that satisfies both sides so that peace talks can be reopened. I believe that the only way to break the deadlock is to restore the Military Three-Person Committee meeting. Marshall can exert necessary pressure on both sides during the meeting. The Democratic League is very disappointed that the Kuomintang-Communist negotiations have not been successful. Since the government has refused to convene a comprehensive committee meeting of the Political Consultative Conference to discuss political issues, then having Marshall chair and reopen the Military Three-Person Committee meeting is the only way to move towards peace. The Democratic League is not opposed to the convening of the National Assembly, but it firmly opposes unilaterally deciding the date of the meeting.</p>

<h3>Party and Government Reform Movement; First Symposium Held by Party Members in the Capital; Liang Hancao Emphasizes Four Basic Principles</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The first symposium on the Party and Government Reform Movement for Party members in the capital was held in the afternoon on the 8th, inviting responsible persons from the various district Party headquarters in the capital to participate. About 200 people including Liang Hancao and Yu Jingtang attended. He Zhonghan chaired the meeting. First, Liang Hancao reported on the start of the Party and Government Reform Movement and described its motivation and significance. He emphasized that it is necessary to develop: (1) Unity of revolutionary comrades and implementation of democracy within the Party; (2) Overthrow of bureaucratic capitalism and implementation of the Principle of People's Livelihood; (3) Elimination of bureaucratic officialdom and implementation of democratic politics; (4) Promotion of national integrity and defense of national sovereignty, and other basic principles, to be able to say that we are engaged in the reform movement. Finally, he hoped that this movement will be extended to various counties and cities in all provinces, so that there will be an atmosphere of discussion and research everywhere, and a call for reform, so as to promote a major change in reform. After the speech, responsible persons from the various district Party headquarters in the capital expressed many views on strengthening the Party's organization, implementing a general census of Party members, and improving the district Party headquarters. Finally, it was decided to ask the responsible persons of the various district Party headquarters to launch symposiums in various units in the short term, and the second symposium will be held two weeks later on Monday to comprehensively study the opinions of comrades from various district Party headquarters.</p>
<h3>US Navy Secretary Flies to Nanjing Yesterday; Specifically to Meet Premier Song; Arrived in Shanghai That Evening and Returned to the United States</h3>

<h3>Soviet Opposition to US Aid to China Intended to Prevent Our Strength; Analysis by New York Times Reporter</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 9th] New York Times correspondent in Moscow, Middleton, reports that for a week, the Moscow press has fiercely opposed U.S. interference in Chinese affairs. Pravda even accused the United States of violating the Moscow Agreement not to interfere in China's internal affairs. The reason for the Soviet Union's attitude is that after the collapse of the powerful Eastern nation of Japan in World War II, the Soviet Union believed that the development and plans of the Soviet Far East could proceed unimpeded from now on, and hoped that no other powerful nation would rise up to be the Soviet Union's enemy. Therefore, we should observe this from this perspective: The Soviet Union blames the U.S. for military aid to China. He also pointed out the Chinese part of the Soviet Union's world policy, saying that although the Soviet Union was among the strongest countries after the war, the development of various situations since the end of the war has weakened the hopes of the Soviet Union's expected expansion period. One of these developments is the continued U.S. aid to China. Soviet newspapers commented that China, with its huge manpower and "reactionary" government, could become an area of military development to interfere with the Soviet Union's plans in the Siberian interior and Primorsky Krai. The Soviet Union believes that after the disappearance of Japanese pressure, the Soviet Union should have the right to do what it wants on both the east and west sides and does not want the United States to assist an Asian government that is uniquely capable of rivaling the Soviet Union. This meaning is very clear in the comments of various newspapers.</p>

<h3>Sino-American Agricultural Technology Mission Paid Respects to Chairman and Ambassador Ma Yesterday and Will Immediately Begin Studying Our Agricultural Problems</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Chairman Chiang received the Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Delegation at his official residence at 4:00 PM today. The delegation, which arrived in Nanjing yesterday afternoon, consisted of eighteen people: H. H. Love, Homer, Buck, Meier, Miss A. C., Ke Yu, Ge Shi, Xie Zhi, Shen Zonghan, Ye Qianji, Yun Wansen, Yang Maochun, Lin Gang, Wu Jinqing, Ma Baozhi, and others. They were accompanied by Zhou Yichun, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry. The three American representatives of the delegation paid a courtesy visit to Special Envoy Marshall at 12:35 PM this morning. In the next few days, they will collectively visit the ministers of various central ministries. Starting from the 11th, they will begin discussing issues related to agricultural education, research, promotion, and finance. They are scheduled to visit the Jinling University and National Central University agricultural colleges and their affiliated farms on the 19th.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Delegation was received by Chairman Chiang today, who hosted a tea party. According to the American experts, the Chairman was extremely cordial, deeply concerned about the delegation's plan, and inquired about various issues.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Delegation began its research today, hoping to formulate a plan to ensure that the Chinese people have no worries about food and to restore the export of its main agricultural products to provide foreign exchange and maintain the national economy. The delegation consists of twenty members, ten of whom are American agricultural experts selected by the U.S. government, and ten are Chinese agricultural and trade talents selected by the government. The delegation is tasked with going to Shenyang and northern Manchuria, and hopes that the CCP leaders will cooperate with them to investigate the agricultural situation in the "liberated areas" controlled by the Communist army. In addition to investigating the backwardness of Chinese agricultural technology, diagnosing its ailments, and seeking to increase production and improve quality, the delegation will also formulate plans to improve China's tung oil, silk, tea, carpets, and fisheries, and increase their output. The delegation will be divided into five teams, each with at least one American expert, who will work with Chinese members to thoroughly investigate their production and sales methods. The delegation will focus on the quality of Chinese export goods and standardize them. In the past, exports from China and other Eastern countries lacked standards, and the quality of each batch of goods was inconsistent, making sales difficult. One of the main problems for the agricultural delegation is to suggest a method so that those purchasing tung oil carpets from China in New York or London can be sure of the quality of the goods they are purchasing. Once the investigation is complete, they will reconvene in Nanjing or Shanghai to prepare to make recommendations.</p>
<h3>French Economic Delegation Discusses Sino-French Trade Relations and Will Discuss Ways to Promote Them with Us</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Henri Hoppenot, head of the French Economic Delegation to the Far East, who came to Nanjing on official business, issued a statement today, saying that the purpose of the French Economic Delegation to the Far East is to promote the development of technical, industrial, and trade relations between China and France. France has historically exported industrial equipment and chemicals to China, while importing raw silk, tea, and other special manufactured goods, such as light bulbs and rare minerals necessary for French industry. Vietnam's exports to China are mainly rice, coal, and rubber. After the restoration of security in Vietnam, the export of rice may resume. France's transportation and steel industries have recovered, and heavy industry is also active, so France may regain its position in the world market. Currently, trade relations with China are hindered by high prices in China, and this point will be one of the items to be discussed when I hold negotiations with the Chinese authorities in the future. I can confidently say that by September of this year, French ships can resume sailing between Shanghai, Haiphong, and Saigon, and trade between China and Vietnam will be greatly developed. In addition, I hope that an agreement can be reached on the issue of French airlines passing through China, but there is no definite date for the resumption of normal air traffic between the two countries.</p>

<h3>U.S. Import Trade Increases, While Our Exports to the U.S. Decrease</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service Washington Dispatch, 8th] U.S. importers are now doing their best to purchase goods from various countries. The total amount of U.S. imports is currently about $4.5 billion annually, which is an increase compared to 1929 and not far from the record high of $5.28 billion in 1920. Sixty percent of U.S. imports are supplied by ten major countries. The current ten countries are (in order of supply of goods): (1) Canada, (2) Brazil, (3) Cuba, (4) India, (5) Mexico, (6) Argentina, (7) South Africa, (8) Colombia, (9) Australia, (10) United Kingdom. As for the ten major countries that supplied goods to the United States in 1937, they are very different from the current situation. Countries such as China and the Philippines have declined. This rise and fall can be clearly seen in the following table. The rankings in 1937 were: Canada, British Malaya, UK, Japan, Cuba, Argentina, Philippines, Brazil, Dutch East Indies, China.</p>

<h3>Executive Yuan Engineering Planning Group Recommends Construction of Three Major Highway Lines Total Expenses Over Three Hundred Million U.S. Dollars</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] It is reported that the construction of highways in our country after the war, due to the limitation of reconstruction funds and the unstable domestic situation, will still focus on maintenance work at the current stage. As for new highways, it has been tentatively decided to construct three lines: (1) from Shanghai via Nanjing, Hankou to Chongqing, (2) from Xi'an to Hankou, (3) from Beiping to Tanggu. The construction of these three highway lines was recommended by the Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan, adopted by the Highway Administration, and personnel have been dispatched in batches to various sections to carry out surveying and mapping work. All three highway lines are first-class standard national highways, with a road surface width planned to be 6 to 7 meters and a roadbed width planned to be 9 to 12 meters. The road surface is planned to be paved with cement. If cement production is insufficient, asphalt or bitumen pavement will be used instead. The original old roads of the three lines are too badly damaged and the slopes are too far from the standard. Therefore, the construction of the new roads will not utilize the old roads, and new routes will be opened up entirely. However, this project is huge, with estimated expenses of US$337,395,250. The official commencement of the project depends on the loan from the United States.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The tasks of the American consultants of the Engineering Planning Group of the Executive Yuan have been largely completed, and they will gradually leave China and return to the United States in the near future. Also, Hou Jiayuan, the leader of the group, went to Beijing yesterday morning (9th) on official business.</p>

<h3>Cultural Traitor Wen Yuanmo Publicly Tried at the Nanjing High Court Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Wen Yuanmo, one of the major traitors in North China, was tried for the first time at the Capital High Court on the 9th. Wen Yuanmo is 55 years old, a native of Guiyang. He studied natural sciences in Japan in his early years. After returning to China, he served as a lecturer at Central University, Peking University, Normal University, and Fu Jen Catholic University. Since August of the 27th year, he willingly accepted the invitation of the traitor Tang Erhe, served as the dean of the Faculty of Science of the puppet Peking University, and was appointed by the enemy as the director of the Faculty of Engineering of the East Asian Cultural Association. In March of the 29th year, he also served as the director of the North China Observatory, and later served as a member of the puppet North China Political Affairs Committee and concurrently as the supervisor of the Education General Office, and also served as a member of the Puppet Xinmin Society General Assembly. When he was interrogated on the 9th, Court President Ge Zitan presided over the trial and announced that the trial would be adjourned to 9:00 AM on the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu High Court Procuratorate Warrants the Arrest of Traitor Gao Zhongli</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou Dispatch, 9th] The Jiangsu High Court Procuratorate issued an arrest warrant for the traitor Gao Zhongli on the 9th. Gao Zhongli became attached to the enemy at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, serving as a member of the standing committee of the Second District of the puppet Lianglu Party Department and the deputy director of the Shanghai North Station. In October of the 28th year, he induced the arrest of Li Dasan, a member of the Lianglu Party Department. Recently, the Special Party Department Executive Committee of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways reported him to the Jiangsu High Court Procuratorate. When the Railway Management Committee detained him, Gao Zhongli absconded in fear of punishment.</p>
<h3>Puyi's Crimes are the Same as Wang Jingwei's and Should Not Be Regarded as a War Criminal</h3>
<p>Statement by Zhao Chen, President of the Capital High Court</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Puyi, the "puppet emperor," was captured by the Soviets after the victory and detained in Boly. After repeated negotiations by our government, the Soviets have agreed to extradite him to our country. Recently, there have been rumors that he will be escorted to Beijing and tried as a war criminal. Today, a reporter met with Zhao Chen, President of the Capital High Court, and inquired about this matter. According to his statement: Puyi was originally a citizen of the Republic of China. His actions in the Nine Eastern Provinces, willingly being used by the enemy and falsely claiming to be emperor, are similar to the crimes of Wang Jingwei and Chen Gongbo. He should be convicted as a traitor and should not be regarded as a war criminal. War criminals must have committed the crimes of invading a country and causing war. The "Manchukuo" puppet regime has not been recognized by our country, nor has it been recognized internationally. Moreover, the Northeast has now been recovered by us. All former officials of the puppet Manchukuo should be punished as traitors. Traitors and war criminals should never be confused.</p>
<h3>Editorial: Please Allied Nations Understand China</h3>
<p>China is one of the five major powers of the United Nations. In today's world of increasingly developed transportation, China and its allies have frequent exchanges and close relationships, which goes without saying. The Chinese people must understand the allied nations, and the allied nations must also understand China. Mrs. Roosevelt once said that demanding international cooperation must begin with international understanding, which is indeed a penetrating statement. And today, we must first ask the allied nations to understand China, and there are several fundamental points.</p>
<p>First, China is a peace-loving country, and the Chinese people are especially peace-loving. Traditional Chinese thought has always opposed "aggression"; sayings such as "stopping war to show power" and "those who are good at war should be severely punished" are especially embraced by the Chinese people. Special Envoy Marshall said at a farewell banquet for General Feng Yuxiang that the Chinese people used to be fond of philosophy, but now they are very different from before, and seem to be fond of war. Perhaps Marshal Marshall's words were spoken in jest, out of deep affection, but in fact, the Chinese people in general are definitely not fond of war. Currently, there are many places in China where there is an "on-and-off" civil war, the reason for which is that a few "fire-starters" want to use military force to争夺地盘, which is definitely not what the people want. Even the more they say "oppose the civil war," the more vigorously they actually "fight the civil war." Therefore, what the people hope for is not the beautiful slogan of "opposing the civil war," but the fact of eliminating the civil war based on justice and fairness. The Chinese people believe that the only way to stop the civil war is to advocate justice and fairness, distinguish right from wrong, and then give the peace disruptors the punishment they deserve to make them dare not provoke, which will be effective; otherwise, all efforts will be in vain. Mrs. Marshall said that Marshal Marshall could not sleep or eat well because of his mediation work. While we are ashamed and grateful, the fact that Marshal Marshall was unable to exercise his right of arbitration as a mediator is indeed a major factor in the delay in making a decision. Therefore, we first ask the allied nations to understand that it is not that the Chinese people are fond of war and do not love peace, but that the Communist Party opposes arbitration and obstructs peace.</p>
<p>Second, the Chinese people today are neither willing to be subservient to foreigners nor intentionally xenophobic. Subservience to foreigners or xenophobia is caused by a sense of national inferiority. Only those who have cultivated a subservient mentality toward foreigners will have xenophobic words and actions. The two come from the same source. China is a member of the United Nations, and unequal treaties have been abolished. The Chinese people should be self-reliant and self-strengthening. Why be subservient to foreigners? And all nations that treat us as equals, based on forgiveness, certainly do not want China to flatter them again. As for xenophobia, we have received much help during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War. We are now striving to work hand in hand with the allied nations, so how can we妄图閉關自守? Moreover, the United States has sincerely helped us, and the U.S. military is currently stationed in China with a mission, so the Chinese people have no anti-American sentiment at all. Although the Yan'an Communist Party's "July 7th Declaration" still clamors for "U.S. troops to withdraw from China" based on the anti-American arguments of Moscow newspapers and Mao Zedong's anti-American broadcasts, discerning people can definitely see where the command post of this shallow cry is, and it is definitely not what a patriotic Chinese people want to issue. Professor Pei Fei, an authority on U.S. Far Eastern affairs, recently came to China and discussed the current situation in our country with reporters in Nanjing, saying that China urgently needs national peace and unity. The United States also sincerely hopes that China will be democratically and peacefully unified, and has no political or territorial ambitions. The stationing of U.S. troops in China is beneficial to China's peace and causes suspicion in the Soviet Union, but China can no longer use international contradictions. Whether it hopes to use the Soviet Union to resist the United States or the United States to resist the Soviet Union is wrong. In recent years, Professor Pei Fei can be counted as one of the best in understanding China among the allied nations.</p>
<p>Third, the Chinese people are determined not to see another world war, especially not to see the flames of world war break out on Chinese soil first. Therefore, China has no intention of exploiting international contradictions for its own benefit. Frankly speaking, China is nominally one of the five powers, but it is still the "weakest" of the five. We can only treat each other with sincerity to gain the trust of the allied nations. In the late Qing Dynasty, those who handled foreign affairs had the idea of "using barbarians to control barbarians," but we believe that the national government will never adopt this inferior strategy. In today's China, when discussing international routes, there may be two completely different opinions: relying on the United States to resist the oppression of the Soviet Union. In fact, both of these views are either foolish or妄, and are unacceptable. China, between the United States and the Soviet Union, even if it cannot fulfill the mission of being a bridge between the two countries, at least does not want to use the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union to cause war, because if war is inevitable, then the first victims will not be the United States and the Soviet Union, but China, which will become a battlefield. What we want the allied nations to understand is that China today only knows how to work hand in hand with nations that treat us as equals, only knows how to abide by the international treaties that China has signed, and will never oppose the Soviet Union, nor will it ever oppose the United States; but at the same time, it does not want a part of the people to rely on foreign influence to cater to one country and oppose another. This is the way for the Chinese people to be self-reliant; this is also the way for the Chinese state to maintain world peace.</p>

<h3>After the Opening of the Shanghai-Hankou-Kunming Line, the Transportation to Kunming Improves</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Kunming Aviation News] Nearly a year after Japan's surrender, everything here is still not much different from the war period. More than 100,000 people from other provinces who have been in Kunming for several years, even if their hearts are set on returning home, have not been able to leave Kunming by more than one-third due to the lack of transportation. The news of the restoration of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is still extremely vague, and there is no possibility of opening the line within this year due to the lack of materials. In terms of air transport, the China Aviation Corporation is doing a good job. Passengers on the Kunming-Chongqing and Kunming-Hanoi lines can make their trips on schedule after registering. However, it is heard that tickets for flights or ship berths from Chongqing to Beijing, Shanghai, Beiping, and Tianjin are extremely difficult, so Chongqing is called a "dead end." Returnees here regard it as a dangerous road and dare not go there rashly. Since the Central Company's Shanghai-Hankou-Kunming flight opened on the 1st of this month, a new route has been opened for returnees in Kunming.</p>

<h3>Summoned by the Four Nations of the US, UK, USSR, and France: Peace Conference Invitations Issued Yesterday, Accompanied by Proposed Amendments to the Rules of Procedure; Four Foreign Ministers Begin Discussions on the German Question</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch] London, 9th (Broadcast): The French government has today issued invitations to twenty-one countries to attend the Peace Conference to be held on July 29th. These invitations were sent out in the names of the four foreign ministers.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 9th]: The Four Foreign Ministers Conference, previously deadlocked over the convening of the peace conference, broke the impasse after four days and has today turned to discussing the German question. The Soviet Union's "important declaration" on its German policy is now eagerly awaited. There is much speculation about the nature of this announcement, with some suggesting that the Soviet Union intends to establish a central administrative body within the Federal Republic of Germany, together with the US, UK, and France. Others say that the Soviet side will condemn the US and UK for "engaging in secret negotiations behind the Soviet Union's back." After the Foreign Ministers' Conference concludes its discussion of the German question, it will discuss the Austrian question and the Italian political situation. The four foreign ministers will then perhaps adjourn in order to attend the Peace Conference. The rules of procedure for the Peace Conference will be drafted this morning by the four national advisors and submitted to the four foreign ministers for approval in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 8th]: Regarding the procedures for the Peace Conference to be held on the 29th of this month, the Four Foreign Ministers Conference has reached an agreement and decided to send invitations to the participating countries, a total of seventeen, this afternoon. This agreement was reached at the request of French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Bidault, who held a secret meeting and used his compromise proposal as a basis.</p>
<p>Today, the four foreign ministers held one secret meeting and two open meetings, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. The first meeting was chaired by US Secretary of State Byrnes and lasted for two hours and fifteen minutes. At the adjournment, the four foreign ministers had not yet reached an agreement on the convening of the Peace Conference. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov stated that since the date for convening the Peace Conference had already been jointly decided, he had no intention of reconsidering it and advocated issuing invitations immediately, but hoped that a draft of the rules of procedure for the Peace Conference could be attached to the invitations. Regarding the rules of procedure, the French proposal could serve as a basis for discussion, with only the addition of an amendment stating that all resolutions passed by the Peace Conference plenary session or its committees must be approved by a two-thirds majority of those present. Except for procedural matters, a simple majority would suffice for passage. US Secretary of State Byrnes replied that the Four Foreign Ministers Conference had previously decided on the date for the Peace Conference and should abide by it, but it would be unacceptable to force the Peace Conference to accept a set of rules of procedure by dictation. The US delegation insisted on issuing invitations immediately and was prepared to discuss all suggestions regarding the procedures of the Peace Conference. British Foreign Secretary Bevin held the same view and said that he was prepared to consider all suggestions, provided that the right of the Peace Conference to amend the agenda was not restricted. He also implied that the proposals put forward by France and the Soviet Union after the invitations were issued could be discussed.</p>
<p>Thereupon, Byrnes, in his capacity as chairman, asked the foreign ministers of the UK, France, and the Soviet Union, "Should the invitations be issued immediately?" The British and French representatives gave affirmative answers. Molotov reiterated that he had no intention of postponing the convening of the Peace Conference, but still believed it was necessary to attach a draft of the rules of procedure to the invitations. He said that there were three precedents that could be cited regarding procedural matters: (1) The rules of procedure for the 1919 Peace Conference were decided in advance; (2) The rules of procedure for the United Nations General Assembly were decided in advance by a preparatory committee; (3) Regarding this matter, the French delegation had made suggestions in April of this year, to which all parties had not raised any objections in principle. These suggestions, together with the amendments proposed by the Soviet Union (see above), could be attached to the invitations for issuance. Molotov also implied that if the Four Foreign Ministers Conference could not agree on the procedures for the Peace Conference, then the resolutions passed by the four foreign ministers might become problematic again.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Byrnes also made it clear that the US delegation would support any resolution unanimously passed by the four foreign ministers in the twenty-one-nation Peace Conference, such as the resolutions that had already been established regarding the issue of Trieste's affiliation, reparations issues, and other matters. British Foreign Secretary Bevin agreed, but the British delegation reserved the right to reconsider any issues that had not been fully resolved. The Four Foreign Ministers Conference then adjourned until 5:00 PM, when it would hold another secret meeting.</p>
<h3>Analysis of Soviet Attitude Toward Germany in the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference: Full Guarantee of the Implementation of Democracy Required; Foreign Troops Should Remain Stationed for a Long Time to Ensure Security</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 8th]: As the Paris Four Foreign Ministers Conference is about to discuss the German question, all parties are concerned about the Soviet Union's attitude toward this issue. According to diplomatic sources here, the Soviet political and journalistic circles have not announced any specific plans regarding the future of Germany. However, the Soviet Union's general attitude toward the German question can be seen in the various principles that had been established before Germany's defeat. These principles stipulated that Germany should bear responsibility for the war and should lose territory, but the entire German people should not be punished. Germany must remain unified, but the implementation of democracy must be fully guaranteed. Foreign troops will continue to occupy Germany for a long time to ensure the security of other European countries. The first principle stipulates that the German people, the German national character, and the German state should not be destroyed. The German people must continue to exercise their sovereignty within their territory, and Germany should maintain spiritual, political, and economic unity. Most importantly, Germany should forever cease to threaten the peace and freedom of other countries. However, to achieve this goal, it is essential to fundamentally democratize the political and economic institutions and national spirit of Germany. As for the other principles, they are of secondary nature and can be ignored.</p>
<p>Regarding the division of Germany into several independent small states, not only would it never ensure common peace, but it would also form a threat from the very beginning, because these small states would have no other role to play except to be manipulated by imperialists. The Soviet government believes that Germany should bear responsibility for the war, without any doubt, and recognizes that the entire German people did not offer much resistance to their militarist leaders, but at the same time also believes that the German people should not be punished indiscriminately. For the sake of the German people, not only should reparations be allowed, but territory must also be ceded, so that the German imperialist acts of aggression will never be seen again. The Soviet government believes that the current state of the German border revision is a fait accompli, and this revision is beneficial to the Soviet Union and other Eastern European allies. The Soviet government also attaches particular importance to the results of the recent Polish referendum, in which the vast majority voted in favor of Poland's new borders. The Soviet Union fully recognizes that France has been invaded by Germany three times in less than a hundred years, and the country has the right to obtain security guarantees. The German Ruhr industrial zone should no longer be used as a military and economic weapon and a military factory for direct attacks on France, but the Ruhr area should also not become a stronghold against the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>In short, the Soviet government has not yet put forward a specific plan on the Soviet Union's view of the future status of western Germany. Government officials only believe that the Soviet representatives are eager to solve the German problem and are fully prepared to discuss it. Soviet government officials certainly also admit that the establishment of a peace treaty with Germany is still insufficient; eradicating National Socialism, promoting democracy, and eradicating militarist ideas are all long-term and arduous tasks. The occupation of Germany must last for a considerable period of time. As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, it took nearly three years to drive out the aggressors under Hitler's command. After suffering a painful lesson, there is no room for compromise on this point.</p>
<h3>Where is the Faith of the Allied Nations?: We Were Not Included in the Invited Countries; The Shanghai Branch of the Diplomatic Association Expressed Its Solemn Position, Firmly Demanding that the Authorities Argue on the Basis of Reason</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 8th]: The Four Foreign Ministers resolved tonight to issue invitations tomorrow to the twenty-one-nation Peace Conference to be convened on July 29th, accompanied by a draft of the Peace Conference procedures.

<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch]: The Shanghai branch of the China National Diplomatic Association believes that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's opposition to China being invited to the Peace Conference was inappropriate.

A telegram is currently being drafted and sent to the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and other countries, urging them to reconsider. It also telegraphed the Nanjing General Assembly, Foreign Minister Wang, and Ambassador Qian Tai, making a solemn statement and firmly demanding that they argue on the basis of reason to respect China's status.</p>

<h3>Five Small Countries Apply to Join the United Nations: Conflict Lurks in the Security Council</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 9th]: The United Nations Security Council recently received membership requests from four countries, Albania, Ireland, Portugal, and Outer Mongolia, and now the Kingdom of Transjordan has also requested to join as a member state, leading to the potential causes of conflict that seem to be forming today. Because some of these newly applying countries have deeply biased views on the issues that the council is about to consider, this point may cause disagreements on the issue of whether to allow these countries to join. The Security Council is now scheduled to meet tomorrow at 7:00 PM to discuss temporary rules and study technical decision-making methods so that the International Court of Justice in The Hague will be open to non-member states uniformly.</p>

<h3>Armed Farmers Riot in Central Provinces of the Philippines: Fierce Battle Occurs in Southeastern Suburbs of Manila</h3>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 8th]: Armed farmers in the Philippines engaged in a fierce battle before dawn today near the headquarters of the US 13th Air Force near Fort McKinley, six miles southeast of Manila, and were dispersed by the Philippine constabulary. It is not yet known whether this battle was a party struggle or just a clash between bandits. At the same time, the invisible martial law in central Luzon Island also has a strengthening trend. According to Interior Minister Sulyte, the number of Philippine constabulary in the disturbed area will increase. Since the failure of the July 4 truce agreement, the number of conflicts in the central provinces has been increasing daily. The constabulary is ordered to pursue lawbreakers to their hiding places and isolate them until they agree to disarm. According to inspectors from the central provinces, the government's policy of wanting the armed farmers to submit is like trying to catch fish by climbing a tree. In addition, the representative of the government of Nueva Ecija province reported that the Huk people in the province refuse to register or hand over their guns, and 80% of the province's rice fields have been abandoned because farmers do not have sufficient protection and dare not go to the fields to work.</p>
<h3>Huk Leader Accuses Government of Implementing Policies</h3>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 8th]: Philippine Huk leader Taruc told a reporter from this agency today, accusing President Roxas and other government leaders of reactionary policies, saying that this policy is enough to hinder the restoration of peace in central Luzon Island and cause national disturbances. It is said that agricultural reform is still a fundamental problem, but the illegal violence of the Philippine constabulary has caused turmoil. Eighty percent of the constabulary in central Luzon Island were police officers during the former Japanese occupation, and farmers hate this group to the bone. Recently, as a result of a conflict between villagers and government personnel, 100 farmers died, and farmers' wives in Pampanga province were raped by constables everywhere. Two labor union leaders had their tongues cut off.</p>
<h3>International Red Cross Holds First Meeting After the War: Soviet Representative Has Not Yet Arrived</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 8th]: The International Red Cross is holding a meeting in Oxford, which is the first conference since the end of the war.

President O'Connor of the American Red Cross delivered the opening speech.</p>
<h3>Observation by American Reporter Stationed in the Soviet Union: Amity Between the US and the Soviet Union is Impossible; Soviet People are Pure, Hardworking, and Practical; There is Still Some Freedom Under a Dictatorial Government</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 8th Special Dispatch]: Atkinson, a special correspondent for the New York Times who has just returned to the United States from the Soviet Union, recently wrote that amity between the United States and the Soviet Union is not possible for several years, and that dealing with the Soviet government in a friendly way will inevitably lead to failure. In the first article, Atkinson said, "If we want to have a proper relationship with the Soviet Union, we must abandon some of the usual familiar concepts of friendship." He then explained that the meaning is "friendship" with close links to political compromise is not what we need. In fact, it is neither possible nor what is being discussed here. Because the Soviet government agency is a political tool, and the friendship between ordinary human beings is completely different. Atkinson concluded, "Although we are not enemies, we are not friends either. What we can hope for at most is to maintain armed peace for several years." According to Atkinson, generally speaking, "the Soviet people are respectable people, pure, hardworking, and practical, but unfortunately, there is a Soviet government between us and the Soviet people. After traveling in the Soviet Union for nearly a year, Atkinson observed that the dictatorship of the proletariat is actually the dictatorship of the thirteen members of the Politburo of the Communist Party. There is no freedom at all in the Soviet Union." When Atkinson was the special correspondent in Chongqing before being transferred to Moscow, he said that the Soviet government is accustomed to using force within the union, so it also has its instinctive concept of force in its diplomacy. At this point, Atkinson advocated that the United States also needs to use equal force, and said, "Where our interests lie, we must apply equal power on the opposite side. This is the most reactionary method of dealing with international affairs, but judging from the Soviet government's attitude towards the defeated countries and the behavior of the Soviet army in the three northeastern provinces, the fundamental spirit of its government is reactionary."</p>
<h3>Tanaka Ryukichi Recalls: On the Eve of July 7th, Using Anti-Communism as an Excuse to Create Autonomy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 9th]: Former Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, Tanaka Ryukichi, continued to testify in the International Court today, saying that when Japan planned to establish autonomous regions in North China, it wanted to find an excuse. Finally, it was decided to adopt the slogan of "anti-communism." This was decided in 1935, and the Kwantung Army sent Doihara to Peiping. Tanaka avoided mentioning any aggressive intentions of Japan, and his answers intended to prove that the CCP guerrillas and anti-Japanese elements forced Japan to do so. When asked whether this action prompted the Kwantung Army and the Japanese army in North China to decide to establish an autonomous region in the five provinces of North China, Tanaka replied: This is one of the reasons for the anti-communist slogan. Half of Shanxi Province was occupied by the central government, and its purpose was to resist Japan and save the country. The central government and guerrillas made Manchuria uneasy. Japan wanted to set up a buffer zone to prevent the CCP army from entering Manchuria from the Chinese headquarters. Tanaka continued: Doihara and Doihara had a dispute over the issue of stationing troops in North China, and their friendship broke down; but the two had the same views on the issue of establishing autonomous regions in the five provinces of North China. The court asked whether Japan intended to create trouble in China? Tanaka replied sharply: "I said that the autonomy movement was intended to cause friction with China more than once." Tanaka made a favorable defense of Minami Jiro, the commander of the Kwantung Army at the time. At the same time, the defense counsel for defendant Hiranuma Kiichiro requested that Hiranuma be transferred from Sugamo Prison to Tokyo Imperial Hospital, but was rejected by Presiding Judge Webb.</p>
<h3>Araki's Confession in Prison</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 9th]: The International Court resumed trial today. The prosecutor presented the confession of former Army Minister Araki Sadao in Sugamo Prison, stating that in December 1931, the Japanese Privy Council held a meeting and decided that the army should occupy the four northeastern provinces. Emperor Hirohito also attended, but did not speak. When asked whether the Japanese Emperor approved the occupation plan, he replied: The Japanese Emperor knew nothing about the occupation plan. Shortly after I took office as Army Minister, I decided that the four northeastern provinces must be occupied and pacified.</p>
<h3>American Government Doesn't Plan to Prosecute Burmese Puppet Prime Minister</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 8th]: Authoritative sources said today that the US plans to release Ba Maw, the Prime Minister of the puppet government of Burma under the former Japanese occupation, from Sugamo Prison near Tokyo. The US government will notify the British side within a few days that it does not intend to file charges against Ba Maw.</p>
<h3>Seven Arab League Nations Send Memorandum to Britain and the United States, Requesting a New Status for Palestine Based on the Spirit of the United Nations Charter</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 8th] Following the Arab League Council meeting last month, each Arab nation individually sent a memorandum to Britain and the United States. The Arab League released this memorandum tonight, stating that the current status of Palestine must end and be replaced by a new status established according to the spirit and provisions of the United Nations Charter.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 8th] The Arab League issued a statement tonight in response to the American memorandum regarding the U.S. investigative report, stating: We feel that the Zionist policies will lead to a conflict of interest between the Arab East and the United States. The Palestine problem is not a result of Nazi persecution of Jews, but a direct consequence of Britain's erroneous policies since World War I. If the United States can comprehensively resolve the issue of racial persecution based on humanitarian principles, it will gain the widespread support of the Arab people.</p>
<h3>New American Weapon: Germ Warfare Successfully Developed; More Terrifyingly Destructive Than the Atomic Bomb; Reportedly Once Planned for Use in Attacking Japan</h3>
<p>In this great era of ours, the success of germ weapons has once again increased people's terror. According to information obtained from congressional references, the Navy Department has successfully researched and developed secret weapons. The significance of this new weapon's successful research is not only international, but also cannot be ignored given the current situation in the United States. It should be stated here that the discovery and successful research of bacteria for use as weapons is not solely the work of the Navy Department. The United States has long had an independent institution dedicated to biological warfare testing. The destructive power of these biological weapons is more terrifying than that of the atomic bomb, yet its manufacturing is not as dangerous as that of the atomic bomb. In addition to the Army and Navy, many scientists and civil servants participated in this testing, the most important of whom is arguably Joe Muck.</p>
<p>Three Types of Effects</p>
<p>The effects of this weapon can be divided into three types: The first is that it has a potent toxin that can cause plague. Tests on animals have shown that the toxicity of this weapon can quickly and massively kill enemies at the beginning of infection. This toxin is extracted from a type of bacteria that is constantly reproductive and easily transferable. The seeds propagated by these bacteria can survive in the air or on the ground for a considerable period without the need for special cultivation or specialized equipment. In this situation, these newly generated seeds can be made into bombs and dropped, or carried into enemy territory by special agents and dispersed to trigger their toxicity. The second effect is that the toxicity of this weapon can also cause various malignant diseases in plants and animals.</p>
<p>Small Bomb, Great Toxicity</p>
<p>There have been rumors that this weapon was to be used against Japan in this manner. If the atomic bomb failed to force Japan to surrender after being dropped, a piece of this bacteria, the size of an ordinary pill, could completely poison a field of rice paddies. The original purpose of preparing to use this weapon against Japan was to cut off its food supply. The third effect is increased concentrated toxicity. When applied, it can affect a very large number of people. For example, if this concentrated toxic weapon is placed in the enemy's water source, everyone who drinks the water will be poisoned. If a toxic pill made from this bacteria is mixed into food, a slightly larger dose can kill the poisoned person within a minute. If the dose is smaller, it will cause vomiting and diarrhea. It is currently unknown how long it will take to recover after being poisoned by this toxin.</p>
<p>Bloodless Killing</p>
<p>Just a little thought about this new weapon reveals that it is revolutionary, with the same value as the atomic bomb. Naturally, the difference between this germ bomb and the atomic bomb is that it does not destroy the enemy's production facilities like the atomic bomb does, but rather it is absolutely effective in terms of its killing power; however, in military terms, its value is still inestimable because the effect of this weapon is a bloodless form of killing. This weapon can be made into a bomb or a small pill that can be carried into enemy territory and used. The most difficult problem is that it is much more difficult to control this weapon than the atomic bomb. The method of manufacturing an atomic bomb is very complicated and requires a lot of equipment; but what about biological weapons? According to an authority, it can be manufactured in an ordinary brewery.</p>
<p>Germ Bombs and Peace</p>
<p>These facts undoubtedly add to the responsibility on the shoulders of Mr. Baruch, the U.S. representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. None of the various methods currently used to limit the control of atomic energy can escape a basic conclusion. If the control of atomic energy is to be successful, then all participating countries must sacrifice a portion of their sovereignty. The method of atomic energy control proposed by Acheson requires each country to sacrifice the minimum amount of sovereignty. Baruch may ask each country to sacrifice more sovereignty. Baruch's recent trip to Washington was to conduct a final review of atomic energy control policies before formally submitting a recommendation to Truman. At present, if each country participating in this atomic energy control conference is willing to sacrifice a portion of its sovereignty to this control, then this international institution can truly take effect for a considerable period, using this effective international institution to solve international problems in a peaceful manner, eliminate mutual suspicion, and avoid repeating the mistakes of World War II. This is the ultimate goal of American policy. (Translated by the Central News Agency from the New York Herald Tribune, May 31)</p>

<h3>A Grand Plan to Expand Shanghai</h3>
<p>Eight architects and engineers in this city, with the assistance of technical experts, have spent five months drafting a preliminary grand plan to expand Shanghai into a metropolis capable of accommodating 15 million citizens. This plan has now been submitted to the heads of various municipal departments for study, so that the municipal authorities can formulate a detailed work plan to transform Shanghai, with the first phase lasting five years. According to the preliminary plan, the city's commercial district will be expanded to Nanshi, and the intricate maze-like narrow streets of Nanshi will all be demolished and rebuilt. Hankou Road will be widened to become a secondary thoroughfare, with its western end running through the racecourse. A portion of the racecourse itself will be designated as the central location for civil administration agencies, with the remainder rebuilt into a park. Parks and sports fields will also be added throughout the city, with the area of parks for citizens to stroll in increasing with distance from the commercial district, to improve the health of citizens. The suburban area of Shanghai will be expanded to the shores of Taihu Lake and Zhapu on the edge of Hangzhou Bay. The main industrial area will be located near Yunzaobang in Wusong, and the main port will be located in Zhapu, in accordance with the teachings of the President, with a secondary port in the Wusong area. Pudong will be developed as a residential area, but nine-tenths of it will still be used for cultivation. According to the designers of the plan, the urban population of China accounts for about 5 percent. Based on the situation in other countries, the gradual industrialization of China could increase the urban population to 40 percent. The ideal population of Shanghai is around 25 million, but the area necessary to accommodate this huge population is currently less than one-tenth established. Therefore, Shanghai will have an excellent opportunity that other large cities have not had, to design new urban areas and perfect transportation on virgin land. For centuries, urban designers have only focused on planning on a grand scale, and have largely ignored the importance of rapid vehicular traffic in modern life. Therefore, Shanghai should open up main thoroughfares scientifically designed to be 200 meters wide, and secondary thoroughfares 70 meters wide, to meet the vehicular traffic on congested roads. The designers encountered great difficulties during this planning due to a lack of various statistics and surveys, but it was completed in five months, which is much faster than the urban planning design of London and New York, which took several years.</p>
<h3>Public Trial of Four Defendants in Assault and Injury Case during Parade; Charged with Obstructing Freedom and Causing Injury; Xu Damao and Zhu Jiangsheng Not Allowed Bail</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The case of "Publicly Trialing Spies" and obstructing the freedom of others, which occurred during the "June 13th" parade to see off "People's Representatives" Ma Xulun and others to Beijing and protesting the civil war, has been investigated by the District Prosecutor's Office and prosecuted. A public trial was held yesterday morning at the District Court. Many listeners came, mostly young students, and the Fourth Tribunal was almost unable to accommodate them. The trial was temporarily moved to the First Tribunal, and the opening time was delayed from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM.</p>
<p>Of the four criminals, Xu Damao and Zhu Jiangsheng were in custody, while Diao Minzhi and Ruan Guangyu were out on bail. Yesterday, they reported for questioning. Plaintiffs Zhang Yong, He Xuechun, Yu Yinrong, and others filed ancillary civil suits and hired five lawyers: Duanmu Kai, E Miao, Yu Chuanding, Lu Jiayi, and Zhao Zuwei to appear in court. The defendants also hired three lawyers: Sha Qianli, Yu Zuoliang, and Zhu Shaowen to defend them.</p>
<h3>Prosecutor Fang States the Main Points of the Prosecution</h3>
<p>The case was presided over by Judge Wu Shaochang. After taking the stand, he ordered the bailiffs to bring Xu and Zhu in, and Diao and Ruan stood together in the defendant's dock. After asking for their names, ages, and places of origin, Prosecutor Fang Zheng stood up and stated the main points of the prosecution: Defendants Zhu Jiangsheng, Xu Damao, Diao Minzhi, and Ruan Xianyu, on June 23rd, due to the "People's Representatives" Ma Xulun and others going to Beijing to request peace, participated in a parade. While passing Henan Road, Lin Sen Central Road, the YMCA entrance on Xizang Road, and Fuxing Park, because the victims Yu Jinrong, He Xuechun, Zhang Yong, and others were distributing leaflets, the defendants Xu Damao, Zhu Jiangsheng, and Diao Minzhi beat them. Defendant Ruan Guangyu shouted encouragement in the background. Qiu Shengqing was also beaten and injured in front of the YMCA entrance. The victims Yu Jinrong, He Xuechun, Zhang Yong, and Qiu Shengqing were tied up with ropes and forced to march with the parade. At Fuxing Park, the victims Zhang Yong and others were imprisoned in trucks and guarded by the defendants Diao Minzhi and Zhu Jiangsheng. The police brought the defendants to justice and transferred them for interrogation. When the defendants Xu Damao, Diao Minzhi, and Zhu Jiangsheng committed the assault, students Gu Qingzheng, Huang Jiaqing, and Li Zhaolin witnessed it and gave separate statements to the case. There is also the Nan Yang Hospital injury report submitted by the victims as evidence. The defendants Zhu Jiangsheng, Diao Minzhi, and Xu Damao are jointly charged with the crime of obstructing freedom under Article 302, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. Defendant Ruan Guangyu is charged with Article 30, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law for shouting encouragement and assault. In accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a joint prosecution is filed, requesting legal action be taken.</p>
<h3>Interrogation of the Defendants; All Four Deny the Charges</h3>
<p>Xu Damao stated: 24 years old, working at the No. 1 Woolen Mill of the Central Textile Factory. He participated in the parade as a patrolman on that day. (Question) Why did you march? (Answer) To demand peace and send off the "People's Representatives." (Question) Why does the plaintiff say you beat him, and point out that you beat him in front of the YMCA? (Answer) The plaintiff mistook me. I don't even know where the YMCA is. (Question) How were you arrested? (Answer) After the meeting ended, I was riding a rickshaw back to the factory, passing Guiba Road. Because I had a patrol badge and a patrol stick, I was shouted at and taken to the police station by an unknown young man.</p>
<p>Zhu Jiangsheng stated: 29 years old, a teacher at a school, participating in a primary school teacher's joint training association. They hold a literary morning meeting at Yucai Middle School every Sunday. After arriving at the meeting on June 23rd, it was temporarily decided to postpone the meeting until next week. He immediately formed a team to participate in the parade, with the aim of stopping the civil war, demanding peace, and sending off the "People's Representatives." He knows nothing about the beating incident. (Question) How were you arrested? (Answer) I saw a large truck outside the park entrance. I heard that it was going to western Shanghai, so I jumped on for a ride. I didn't expect the car to drive to the Taishan Branch. Because I was wearing a patrol badge, Branch Chief Zhu called me down for a talk and I was detained. (Question) Was there a "spy" publicly tried in the park? (Answer) I only heard about it. (Question) Were there people on the car or on your body who were "written on"? (Answer) No. (Question) Were you serving as a guard during the public trial? (Answer) No. (Question) Did you hit or arrest anyone on Nanjing West Road and at the YMCA? (Answer) I was at the back of the team, I don't know anything.</p>
<p>Diao Minzhi stated: 19 years old, a second-year student at Lianhua Commercial Practical School. He was notified directly by the "Shanghai Students' Association for Peace" to go to the North Station to welcome the "Representatives." My job was to put up slogans. (Question) How were you arrested? (Answer) I picked up a camera case in Fuxing Park and wanted to find the person in charge to return it. After searching everywhere, I saw a truck and thought the person in charge was on the truck, so I jumped on the truck, and the truck immediately started. When it arrived at the Taishan Road branch, I was taken to the bureau. (Question) Did you see the plaintiff with the words "Spy" and "Bad Egg" written on his body? (Answer) I saw it, but the handwriting was unclear. I only saw a patch of black ink. The court then said, "There were many people distributing leaflets, why did you only grab him? There is no such coincidence that the car would start immediately after you jumped on." Diao could not argue at this point, so he held up two Boy Scout food bags and presented them to the court, saying: "This can prove that the two bags were for the people who posted slogans on that day." The court said: "This bag can also be used to put other things in, so it cannot be established as evidence." Again, (Question) The biggest reason why you arrested those people was because they were distributing leaflets and disrupting the team. Do you know what they said in the leaflets? (Answer) Oppose internal turmoil and demand peace. (Question) Since you are for peace and they are for peace, you are the same and want peace, then their distribution of leaflets cannot be called disruptive behavior, especially the distribution of leaflets cannot be called "National Special Agent." Diao blushed and said, "Yes, yes, yes, I am too young, I am too young."</p>
<p>Chen Guangyu stated: 18 years old, a third-year student at Gezhi Middle School. He came to participate in the parade. He went to the YMCA to watch a ball game, and he doesn't know how they got him to the police station. To this day, I don't know why.</p>
<h3>Three Plaintiffs Describe the Insults They Suffered</h3>
<p>Zhang Yong stated: He has been working as an accountant at the YMCA for four or five years. On the afternoon of the 23rd, when he was reading a book in the library on the second floor, more than 20 people rushed in, holding wooden sticks and wearing patrol armbands. They claimed that they wanted to arrest people who were disrupting the team and distributing leaflets. He told them that the YMCA was a religious organization and that this would not happen. At that time, a tea servant in the dining room on the ninth floor was holding a leaflet he had picked up from outside and was reading it. He was accused of distributing leaflets and throwing foreign bottles and plates at the team from the ninth floor. They forcibly tried to take him away. He argued with them, saying that if they wanted to arrest someone, they should call the police to arrest them, and they should not use this method. He was then falsely accused of being a spy, pushed, and beaten. When he exited the gate, he was tied up and paraded. When he walked to Ma Lang Road, Lin Handa ordered: "National Special Agents" should be searched. His pens and other items were searched, and his clothes were stripped off. A female student walked behind him and wrote the words "Special Agent" on his back with paint. He was then escorted onto a truck to Fuxing Park. Lin Handa stood on the truck and said: "Now we have caught a 'National Special Agent', should we publicly try him?" There was then chorus of agreement. Later, the police sent people to the scene, and he followed them to the police station. The next day, he went to the Nan Yang Hospital for treatment. At that time, I did not find any leaflets. Xu Damao, one of the four defendants, was the one who hit me at the YMCA. Zhang also presented three pieces of dirty clothes painted with red paint on that day.</p>
<p>Yu Jinrong stated: He is a student at the Chinese Vocational School. He did not participate in the parade on the 23rd, but received five or six hundred leaflets from the Shanghai Students' Anti-Internal Turmoil Alliance and distributed them at the intersection of Henan Road and Nanjing Road. He was arrested, beaten, and had words written on his back. He was pulled onto a truck. At that time, Xu, Zhu, and Diao were all on the truck, and Xu was one of the people who participated in the beating.</p>
<p>He Xuechun stated: He is a student at the Sino-French Middle School. He did not participate in the parade on the 23rd. He distributed leaflets from the roof of the high-rise building where he lived on Lin Sen Central Road. He was arrested by a group of people who rushed up, and beaten while walking. When he arrived at Ma Lang Road, his pens, money, diary, and other items were searched and taken away. He was escorted onto the St. John's School bus, and ink was used to write words on his back. After entering Fuxing Park, a chief patrolman asked the public: "Now that we have caught a 'Special Agent', how should we deal with him?" Some people shouted, "Publicly try him," others shouted, "Beat him to death," and others shouted, "Execute him." Later, the police arrived, and they forced us to stand up three times to show the public, and threatened us that if we continue to engage in activities in the future, we should be careful. We were then sent to the police station. He also presented a piece of clothing that was torn at that time.</p>
<h3>Interrogation of Witnesses; Witnessing the Beating</h3>
<p>Another plaintiff, Qiu Shengqing, was absent. Witness Huang Jiaqing was also absent. Two other witnesses, Gu Qinzheng and Li Zhaolin, were interrogated.</p>
<p>Gu stated: He participated in the anti-internal turmoil parade and also participated in the so-called "People's Representative" farewell parade on the 23rd. That day, while passing near the Xie Da Xiang cloth shop at the YMCA, someone said that there were "National Special Agents" in the YMCA. We surrounded and attacked. At that time, Lin Handa said to the crowd: "After they are caught, do we need to publicly try them?" The people below shouted, "Execute them," etc. They then escorted a person with a shaved head and wearing a Western suit surnamed Zhang from the YMCA. Later, someone next to me saw that I was holding propaganda, so they also pointed me out as a "National Special Agent" and grabbed me. They asked me if I was a member of the Three People's Principles Youth League, and I replied no. Because I had no documents, I was slightly beaten and then released. When I returned to the Anti-Internal Turmoil Alliance office to report, I went with several people to Fuxing Park to observe the "public trial" results. I was then transferred to the police station at the intersection of Bopu Road and Fuxu Road.</p>
<p>Li stated: A student at Zhengzheng Night School. After dinner on the 23rd, I was reading a book in the YMCA library when a crowd of paraders rushed in and started beating people. Ruan Guangyu was shouting and hitting from the side. Later, a person was taken away. Several hours later, I saw Ruan coming up and down in the elevator in the questioning office on the second floor, so I took Ruan to the police station. In this democratic era, there should not be such an incident of obstructing the freedom of others. The reason why I took Ruan to the police station was to find out who the real murderer was. The trial was adjourned at this point. The defense lawyers stood up and said: "The case files have not been read, and the defendants have not been interviewed. We will present rebuttal evidence next time." They also requested that Xu Damao and Zhu Jiangsheng, who are in custody, be released on bail. The court did not approve it. The case was adjourned to 9:00 AM on the 16th for further trial. Diao Minzhi and Ruan Guangyu remained on original bail. Xu Damao and Zhu Jiangsheng were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Most of the German僑 (Overseas Chinese) Who Evaded Repatriation Have Been Arrested and Detained; Only Nine People Landed Temporarily</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] There are about dozens of German Nazi Party members in this city who were in hiding to avoid being repatriated. It is now known that most of those who were in hiding have been arrested and detained by the relevant parties. It is heard that the list of those arrested is currently being compiled by the US military authorities. As to whether they should be sent to concentration camps for detention in the future, it must be determined after requesting instructions from the government authorities. In addition, of the first batch of Germans repatriated, nine people, including Li Men, Franz, Miss, Hiblitz, Heishe, Oberme, Roki, Hermann, and Andanqi, were approved by the Executive Yuan to stay here three hours before the "Robin" ship left Shanghai. However, the families and luggage of the nine people were taken back home because they could not be returned in time. Seven of the nine people are technicians and will join several agencies in this city to serve, while the two doctors Roki and Hermann will work in the hospitals of the Chinese Ministry of Health. In addition, three people, Asstedt, Lent, and Heiser, also requested to stay in China and were approved, but before they were ready to leave the ship, the ship had already set sail.</p>

<h3>Key Criminal in the Rong Desheng Kidnapping Case Negotiating Ransom Arrested in Longhua Temple; Careful Planning Afterward Shows He is an Old Hand; Two Packages of US Dollars Found Hidden Under Coal Baskets in Son-in-Law's Home</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The complexity of the Rong Desheng kidnapping case and the difficulty of solving it are unprecedented in this city. Although more than 20 criminals have been arrested by the military police, it is claimed by related parties that this is less than half of the total number of people involved in the case. According to reports from this newspaper, the arrest of Zheng Liantang (pictured), another key criminal responsible for negotiating the ransom procedures with the Rong family, also required considerable effort. Zheng had previously committed three kidnapping cases. In one case, he was sentenced to life imprisonment, but was released after a general amnesty. In another case, he was sentenced to twelve years in prison after being arrested. The most recent case was on September 25th of last year, when he, instigated by Yuan Zhongzhu and others including Luo Wenqing, attempted to kidnap Zhu Linpu, the manager of Tianhe Money Exchange on Sijing Road in this city, but failed. Therefore, since the Rong case occurred, the military police authorities cooperated closely and learned that the main culprits were Yuan Zhongzhu and Luo Wenqing. Based on the clues, they began investigating. At that time, the Rong family was deeply afraid that the hostage would be killed, so all negotiations were kept secret. As a result, it was necessary to seek more information from other criminals. However, when the police sent personnel to Zheng Liantang's residence (next door to Jin Situ Temple on Kangtuo Road, Gordon Road), it was already empty. This further proved that Zheng must be an accomplice.</p>
<p>A few days after the Rong family was released, the police received intelligence that Zheng had received more than 40,000 US dollars in赃款from the case, which was now stored in the belly of a Buddha statue in Jin Situ Temple. Officers were immediately dispatched to the temple, where there was only an old nun. After questioning, she said that someone had indeed hidden a paper package in the belly of the Buddha statue, but she did not know what it was, and it had been taken away by "Sister-in-law Peide." When asked who "Sister-in-law Peide" was and where she lived, she said she did not know. Therefore, the police had to start with "Sister-in-law Peide." Soon, they finally learned that there was indeed a person named "Peide," who was Zheng's apprentice. He and his wife were arrested in Zhengjia Muqiao. After questioning, they confessed: "Zheng came to his residence two days ago, saying that the crackdown on adultery has been very strict recently. He himself had a past suspicion of being a collaborator, so he needed to avoid the limelight temporarily. He now has a package of important documents hidden in Jin Situ Temple, which he instructed his wife to quickly retrieve and send to the Jing'an Temple Road tram stop, to be handed over to a man holding a white fan and wearing white shoes, and also asked to pay attention to newspaper reports, etc." The police followed these clues step by step, and finally learned from "Peide" that Zheng was hiding in Longhua Temple. On the morning of July 5th, in the midst of wind and rain, they went to search the address. At that time, Zheng was still lying in the drum tower. He had originally planned to escape to another place that day, but stopped due to the rain, and was captured. According to his confession, the赃款was hidden in his son-in-law's home. The police found a package containing 10,000 yuan at the bottom of the coal basket, and another package containing 20,000 yuan elsewhere. According to his son-in-law's confession: Zheng told him that it was privately purchased opium and that he should not open it to avoid the smell from leaking out, so he never knew what it was. As for how Zheng was able to stay in Fahua Temple, the monks of the temple said that Zheng usually ate vegetarian food and chanted Buddha, and often came to the temple to burn incense, so they knew each other. This time, Zheng said that he had a family quarrel and came to the temple for a temporary stay to relieve his worries.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhan Rongpei (pictured), the factory director of Shenxin No. 2 Factory, who instigated the crime behind the scenes, was found by the police to have paid out 200,000 national currency before the Rong case occurred as capital for the kidnapping. The check he issued to Wu Zhigang has been traced.</p>

<h3>Luo Wenqing's Wife Also Arrested; More赃款Continues to be Recovered</h3>
<p>Another report: Regarding the Rong case, Du Chunwen, the Director of the Huangpu Branch Bureau, received a tip-off that Luo Wenqing, the main culprit who had already been apprehended, had some赃款stored with his wife, Wang Cuiying. After Wang learned that Luo Wenqing had been arrested, she was deeply afraid of being implicated, so she handed over all the stolen goods in suitcases to her sister, Tang Wang, for safekeeping, and claimed to be going to Hangzhou to avoid the limelight temporarily, and fostered her two children. At that time, Director Du did not know the whereabouts of Luo's wife, but it was rumored that Feng Jingqing, the owner of Yumeichang Knitting Factory, knew the details. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 p.m., Section Chief Zhou Guanghui, staff members Cao Yilan, police chief Zhao Hairu, and Dong Haishen went to the address of Shen Taihao at No. 3 Jiru Lane, Jixiang Street to investigate Yumeichang Knitting Factory and learned that Feng Jingqing lived at No. 8 Meicun Lane 1423, Yuyuan Road, West Shanghai. They immediately went to the address and arrested him. They then went to No. 12 Zhujia Bridge and arrested Tang Wang, and brought them both back to the bureau for interrogation. Wang confessed that the suitcases entrusted by her sister Wang Cuiying were currently stored at the home of Zhang Weiliang at No. 128 Zihua Road, opposite Houjiabang in the city. As for the house at No. 12 Zhujia Bridge, Feng Jingqing rented it on her behalf. Subsequently, the police officers went to the aforementioned location according to the confession and arrested the suspect Zhang Weiliang, who was storing the stolen goods, and seized a suitcase containing US$35,000 in banknotes and four gold rings, worth a total of 80 million national currency. Whether there will be further developments is currently under strict investigation.</p>

<h3>YMCA Luncheon: Mayor Discusses Grain Issues</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The YMCA of this city held a luncheon at the YMCA in Baxianqiao yesterday noon. Mayor Wu Guozhen also attended. During the luncheon, he made a speech on the recent rice market situation, stating that when he first took office, he believed that he could stabilize rice prices, but in fact, due to the complex environment of Shanghai and the machinations of hidden evil forces, the black market is still rampant. It is difficult to deal with some cunning rice merchants and organized scalpers. It has now been decided to allocate rice, although the quality is relatively poor, which may only be desired by lower-middle-class citizens. However, our greatest effort at present is to solve the livelihood of these common people. Wu also hoped that the "good people" in society could cooperate with the authorities.</p>
<h3>American Soldier Robs Police Officer's Handgun</h3>
<p>Police Officer Li Guilin of the Hongkou Police Station was on duty at the intersection of Tianzha Road and Wusong Road at 10 p.m. the night before when he was suddenly pushed down by five American sailors, who seized his handgun and left. A truck passed by, and four soldiers boarded it and fled. Another soldier was apprehended by Li and taken to the police station. The four soldiers who escaped have also been found yesterday. It is reported that the US Naval Headquarters has agreed to compensate for the handgun.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xiaotong Died Tragically: Forced to Drink Poison, Strangled to Death, and Buried; Four Culprits Under Trial Still Attempt to Deny Everything</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Guo Menglin from Jiashan, Liao Keyun from Changzhou, Liu Bingyuan from Zhuan'an, and Tong Guozhong from Nantong, originally served under Su Nide in the Shanghai Office of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Central Party Headquarters. In 1939, Su betrayed the central government and joined the puppet regime's Special Operations Headquarters at No. 76, West Shanghai, and was transferred to be the Chief of the Nanjing District of the puppet department. They also joined the puppet regime and remained under Su. Guo Menglin served as the "Registration Section Chief" and the director of the internal detention center. Liao Keyun served as a member of the Investigation Section, Liu Bingyuan as the Chief of the Action Section, and Tong Guozhong as the Deputy Section Chief of the Investigation Section of the puppet department. In March 1940, Zhang Xiaotong, a member of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, was arrested while working in Shanghai and sent to Nanjing, where he was imprisoned in the puppet detention center and killed by them. Su sent Guo, Liao, Tong, and Lü Beizhen (deceased) to secretly dig a deep pit near the roots of a tree on the Xuanwu Lake. Later, Su, together with Liu Bingyuan, escorted Xiaotong to the site by car. After asking if he had anything to say, Su took out a cup of poison and forced him to drink it. He immediately vomited and fainted. Guo Menglin and Lü Beizhen strangled him with a rope, and Tong Guozhong kicked his abdomen violently. After he died, Liao Keyun found a wooden door, and the four of them, Lü, Guo, Liu, and Tong, carried the body into the pit and buried it. Su gradually took photos and strictly prohibited anyone from disclosing the incident. However, our side learned of the secret, so after the victory, they were arrested and brought to justice one by one. But they still tried to deny everything, saying that they did not know about the incident at all, and claimed: "We sympathize with Zhang Xiaotong very much, but please ask the judge to investigate the real murderer." Liu Bingyuan even cried out "injustice" when answering questions, and even burst into tears when meeting his brother after the interrogation. His brother said that they had not seen each other for ten years, so he was moved to tears. However, he was stopped by the bailiff and sent back to prison within a few minutes.</p>
<h3>Retrial of Special Agent Pan Da: Two Victims Appear in Court to Testify</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The puppet government's special agent Shi Kui Pan Da was retried in the High Court yesterday. Pan Sansheng and Xia Zhongming were called to court to testify. Zhang Zhiwei and Tao Guisong, the victims, were also called to court to testify. According to Pan Sansheng's testimony: the house at No. 40 Jisi Feier Road, where Pan Da lived, was originally rented from the landlord Tao Guisong by Pan Sansheng, who then lent it to Pan Da. Xia Zhongming said that he did not know what Pan Da's job or work was. Tao Guisong testified that Pan Da lived in his house for more than two years, but only paid two months' rent. At that time, he was forced by Pan's power, so he dared not argue with him. Finally, Zhang Zhiwei was called to testify. According to his testimony: his brother Zhang Zhixin was arrested by Pan when the puppet government held a celebration in Zhaofeng Garden and imprisoned in the puppet West Shanghai Police Station, where he was tortured and died. Pan tried his best to deny this. The court hearing was adjourned to be retried. The head of the puppet Social Insurance Bureau was originally a postal worker in the Shanghai Postal General Bureau and a standing committee member of the Shanghai Postal General Bureau Union. Later, he was introduced to the puppet regime by Feng Yixian and presided over the workers' movement. He made great efforts to promote the puppet regime's party affairs, social affairs, and civil movement, and used the Three Principles of the People to incite social sentiment and train puppet party members, which was a serious crime. However, Zhang claimed that he did not harm the people, and had worked hard in social welfare and surrendered himself. After the defendant's lawyer defended him, the court decided to pronounce the verdict at 9:00 a.m. on the 16th.</p>

<h3>Minsheng Company Lost More Than 3 Billion in the Past Five Months; Lu Zuofu Went to Beijing Again Yesterday with Suggestions to Report to the Authorities</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] This reporter recently visited Minsheng Industrial Company to inquire about the recent business development. It is understood that the company's current business is in a very distressed environment. The main reasons are: (1) During the Anti-Japanese War, the company assisted the country in transportation, and the government provided subsidies from time to time, which slightly made up for the losses. After the victory, the subsidies were cancelled, which had an impact on the company's financial adjustment. (2) Since the victory, all the company's ships have been ordered to transport grain, troops, and civil servants, with limited freight charges, while expenses have increased month by month, and revenue and expenditure cannot be matched, resulting in huge monthly losses. (3) All of the company's ships have never been thoroughly repaired in docks during the eight-year Anti-Japanese War, and now all have passed the repair period, and it is difficult to repair them all. Currently, the repair costs for some of the ships have reached 4 billion yuan. (4) Although the Yangtze River ships are smaller than ocean liners and have less tonnage, they have very high horsepower and consume a lot of fuel, and the risk of sailing is also greater than that of ocean liners, and there are frequent unexpected repairs. However, the manpower and equipment on board are not less than that of ocean liners, so it is more difficult to maintain them. (5) The company has been operating the route from Yichang to Chongqing for 20 years, but recently a large number of technical personnel have been moving elsewhere, which makes it difficult for the company to cope. Mr. Lu Zuofu, the General Manager of the company, returned to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago. According to people close to Mr. Lu: Mr. Lu visited Chairman Chiang, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Communications during his trip to Beijing and made some statements about the company's current situation. However, it is reported that no clues have been obtained. It is learned that Mr. Lu went to Beijing again yesterday, carrying a proposal for the future of the shipping industry, to report to the authorities. According to Mr. Lu, the company's total loss in the five months of this year reached more than 300 million, and the debt also increased to more than 300 million. Mr. Lu said that the procedures for borrowing money from Canada to purchase 18 ships have not been fully finalized, and he will need to go abroad in the near future.</p>

<h3>Continuous Rain Breaks 68-Year Record</h3>
<p>The continuous rain in this city has caused inconvenience to the citizens. According to Zheng Zizheng of the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory of the Central Meteorological Bureau, the continuous heavy rain is due to seasonal reasons. In previous years, the mold season was in late May to early June, but this year, due to the seasonal lag, the city did not enter the mold season until the beginning of July.

<h3>Few British Goods are Exported, and it is Difficult for Chinese Businesses to Order</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] According to Mr. Hanmen, the secretary of the British Commercial Counselor, there are currently 140 British companies operating in Shanghai, most of which are companies that resumed business before the war, and only five or six new companies have been established, and they are not important. Mr. Hanmen also said that British businessmen are willing to continue to operate in China after the war, and only a few have closed down due to the death of the owners. Soon, more British businesses will resume business in Shanghai. The above 140 companies include the Shanghai British Business Electricity Company, the Water and Fire Company, the Royal Chemical Company, and the Gu Zhong Tobacco Company. Mr. Hanmen believes that there are currently few British goods exported, so it is extremely difficult for Chinese businesses in Shanghai to obtain orders.

After investigation by the police, Zhou was finally arrested on the third floor of No. 51, Lane 240, Hartung Road, and two handguns were found. According to his confession, Zhou Dunlu and Ma were old acquaintances. When she was a dancer in Kosman a year ago, he patronized her every night, spending a lot of money.

<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] Dr. Kesley, Executive Secretary of UNESCO, presented a memorandum to the bureau's preparatory meeting today, advocating breaking the whole into parts by establishing branches of the bureau in various locations. He suggested dividing the world into ten regions: North America and the West Indies, South America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, the Middle East (including North Africa and Africa south of the Sahara), India (including Burma and Ceylon), the Far East, and Australia. A branch would be established in each region. He advised that care should be taken when planning and conducting work to prevent the bureau from being controlled by any one powerful nation.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 8th] Dr. Somme Selte, the Norwegian representative to UNESCO, said: This organization should concentrate all its efforts on completing one project, instead of reaching too high and far. For example, the illiteracy eradication program is a worthwhile endeavor.</p>

<h3>Civil Affairs Bureau Orders Districts to Distribute National Identification Cards Door-to-Door; Citizens Who Have Not Yet Received Cards May Apply at Any Time</h3>
<p>With the exception of the 11th District, which has not yet completed the process, and the 12th District, where the district government offices have been sealed off by the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, preventing timely distribution, all other districts in the city have completed stamping national identification cards. The Civil Affairs Bureau has issued them to the district government offices for distribution to residents. It is learned that the Civil Affairs Bureau also intends to issue nine points for attention to the district government offices for compliance regarding this work.</p>
<p>(1) The stamped identification cards should be distributed door-to-door immediately by the neighborhood administrators in conjunction with the block leaders, and should not be kept for citizens to pick up themselves, in order to expedite the process. (2) If the cardholder is traveling elsewhere or has other reasons for needing to wait for a period of time to pick up the stamped identification card, it should be turned over to the district government office for safekeeping and should not be kept at the neighborhood office. (3) If the cardholder is deceased, has moved elsewhere, or for other reasons cannot be issued the stamped identification card, a list should be compiled and the identification card returned level by level to the bureau for verification and cancellation. (4) Foreigners who have obtained Republic of China nationality or have naturalized in China according to law are eligible to receive national identification cards, but must submit their documents to the district government office for special processing and stamping. The circumstances and timing of obtaining nationality or naturalization should be noted in the remarks column of the identification card, and the original nationality should not be entered in the nationality field.</p>
<p>(5) After the first issuance of national identification cards, those who become legally eligible to apply for national identification cards must be urged to complete the application form at any time, follow the prescribed procedures, and submit a formal request to the bureau for stamping. If there are a large number of applications, an index should be included. This verification work should be done as it comes, without waiting to accumulate a certain number or process it in batches, in order to expedite the process. (6) If a citizen who applied for a national identification card during the first issuance lost it while it was being stamped, resulting in not receiving it, they should be urged to complete a supplementary application form and identification card, attach a list, and submit it to the bureau for verification and stamping. (7) If a citizen who has already received a national identification card moves, they should submit the identification card along with the relocation application form to the local neighborhood administrator, who will forward it to the district head/household registration director for registration of the new address in the "Change of Address Registration" section of the identification card and return it after stamping with the district head's name.</p>
<p>(8) If a stamped identification card has a photograph that has fallen off due to improper adhesion, the cardholder should be instructed to submit a replacement photograph, which will then be sent to the bureau for restamping. (9) If identification cards from District A are mixed in with those of District B due to carelessness during the stamping process, they must be sorted out and sent to the bureau for redistribution.</p>
<p>Furthermore, citizens aged 14 and above who have not applied for a national identification card should immediately complete an application. Those who subsequently move into the city with the intention of residing permanently, who apply for registration or have resided for more than one month, may apply for a national identification card at the local neighborhood office at any time.</p>

<h3>Authorities Determined to Eradicate the Black Market; Regulations Set Maximum Retail Price for White Rice; Subsidized Rice to be Distributed by District Starting Tomorrow; Five Sheng Per Person Available Upon Presentation of Household Registration</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Grain Price Review Committee held its first meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Representatives from rice shops, including Qu Zhenhua and Zhang Xichao, rice dealers, including Yang Jiuzi, and bean and rice operators, including Wang Bingkun and Gu Yisheng, attended. The meeting was presided over by Ji Mingqi, Chief of the Grain Section, to discuss the price of white rice. The representatives brought various rice samples for reference. The meeting decided on the following prices for white rice: top-grade white *geng* rice, 65,000 yuan; slightly lower-grade rice, a bit less; *yangjian* rice, 65,000 yuan; *buyou* rice, 62,000 yuan; *baodao* rice, 65,000 yuan; milled *you* rice, 58,000 yuan; white *you* rice, 56,000 yuan.</p>
<p>About 20 rice shops in the north and south markets and in the city will have white rice for sale starting today. The price cannot exceed the above limits, and the final price, plus the legitimate profit margin of the rice shop, cannot exceed 71,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The Grain Section of the Social Affairs Bureau also has 5,000 *dan* of Brazilian rice, which will be allocated at a limited price to rice shops that have applied to the Social Affairs Bureau. Groups and factories can apply to the Social Affairs Bureau for purchasing certificates to purchase directly from other locations.</p>
<h3>Rice Shops to Sell Subsidized Rice; District Government Offices to Assist in the Process</h3>
<p>A meeting on subsidized rice sales was held at the municipal government yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, chaired by Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government. Ji Mingqi, Chief of the Grain Section, gave a report on the recent rice situation. Representatives from more than 22 district government offices attended. The meeting decided that each district should assist in the authorities' efforts to sell subsidized rice. It was stipulated that at least three rice shops in each district must sell subsidized rice. In order to prevent black market scalpers and to completely eradicate the black market, the following three concrete measures for purchasing rice were resolved: (1) Citizens must purchase rice based on their household registration certificate. After use, the rice shop will stamp it to prevent fraud and hoarding. (2) Each person is limited to purchasing no more than five *sheng* of rice at a time, and it was decided that purchases can only be made once every five days, so that each person can purchase an average of one *sheng* per day (e.g., a family of five can purchase two *dou* and five *sheng* of rice every five days). (3) When rice shops retail, neighborhood administrators and district representatives will supervise at all times. The above decisions will be implemented across the board starting tomorrow.</p>
<p>It is learned that the municipal government has ordered the police bureau to assist the Social Affairs Bureau in strictly cracking down on rice shops that do not sell allocated rice in accordance with regulations and to strictly prohibit black market scalpers from buying allocated rice to sell on the black market. The police bureau will reportedly dispatch police officers to rice shops distributing rice every day to maintain order. Anyone who attempts to purchase rice without a household registration certificate will be treated as a black market scalper and strictly detained. Citizens without household registration certificates should apply to their neighborhood administrator for a certificate in accordance with regulations.</p>
<h3>Grains Soften</h3>

<h3>Gold and Paper Money Both Mediocre</h3>
<p>The black market rate for US dollars was very mediocre yesterday. It opened at 19.025 million, but the US dollar did not rise. It slightly decreased, and after 10:00 AM, it dropped below 18.9 million. The Central Bank distributed 12 bars at a price of 18.85 million, and it became even more stagnant afterwards. It stabilized somewhat near noon, approaching the 19 million mark. In the afternoon, the US dollar suddenly became popular, boosting demand and rising back to around 19.2 million. As a result, it closed up 25,000 compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments were 200,400, and silver bullion and silver dollars were both flat. The secret commissions ranged from 1.5 to 1.8 *jiao*. The money market continued to loosen.</p>
<p>The initial rate for foreign currency, US dollars, was flat and stable, very mediocre. It retreated from 2,370 yuan to 2,320 yuan when the market opened, and stabilized somewhat near noon, rising to over 2,360 yuan. In the afternoon, the supply dried up, and as soon as demand increased, it rose immediately. Talk of 100 yuan resurfaced. As a result, it closed up 80 yuan. The swap rate for gold was squeezed to around 784 yuan for ten *liang*. The Hong Kong dollar was stable after a flat start, and closed up 5 yuan compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 525 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 635 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 8,500 yuan. Supply still exceeded demand, and trading was sluggish. The US exchange rate remained [blank].</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Rise</h3>
<p>Public bonds continued to see new activity, and short positions were squeezed again. Unified Class C rose from 600 yuan, hovering and rising, and finally approached the 800 yuan mark. The trend revived, which was quite unusual. As a result, it closed up 200 yuan compared to the previous close. Classes A and B also rose 130 yuan, Class D rose 100 yuan, and Class E also rose 150 yuan.</p>
<h3>*Hong* and White Tung Oil Show No Improvement</h3>
<p>The white tung oil market has seen a slight improvement recently due to changes in domestic sales, but exports are becoming increasingly unprofitable and have been temporarily suspended pending price adjustments. The *Hongjiang* tung oil market has also seen a break in the doldrums as towns are preparing for winter sales and purchasing from Shanghai. The market is gradually improving. The current selling price for white tung oil is 77,000 to 78,000 yuan. Old brands of *Xifu Hongjiang* oil are around 80,000 yuan per barrel, slightly down to 74,000 to 75,000 yuan. The local factory's *Hong* oil is 67,000 to 68,000 yuan to 70,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Rise Then Fall; Foreign Stocks Have a Dim Future, Trading is Scarce</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks lacked momentum yesterday and fell again. Small stocks were even more disappointing, while large stocks were still trying to hold up. Midday high prices included Yongsheng Yarn at 460 yuan, Meiya at 2,900 yuan, Jingfu at 198 yuan, Xinyuan at 220 yuan, and Qinxing at 170 yuan.

The gains and losses of medium-sized stocks were minor, while small, unpopular stocks were flat. Veteran stocks were extremely bleak, with more sell orders than buy orders.</p>
<p>Trading in foreign stocks was significantly reduced. The stock exchange's resumption of trading lacked clear regulations for foreign stocks, causing disappointment among holders and shrinking buying interest. With any sell orders, dangerous situations arose. The decline was in order of coldness and heat. Jardine Matheson was the most fearful and weary. Smaller stocks were still mediocre. As a result, only steel was flat. Jardine Matheson fell by 15%. Paper, Asia, Guangyi, and beer were all slightly down. Ewo and the British Alliance fell into flatness.</p>
<h3>Sino-Soviet Trade Begins; Transactions Calculated in US Dollars</h3>

Transactions are calculated in US dollars. Ships traveling between Shanghai and Vladivostok will also call at Tianjin to handle passengers and cargo.</p>
<h3>Yuantaihe Declares Liquidation</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yuantaihe Silver Firm on Henan Road and Jiujiang Road declared a suspension of business and liquidation of accounts yesterday (the 9th) due to market fluctuations affecting capital turnover.</p>
<h3>Conserving Paper; British Newspapers Reduce Size</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] Commerce Minister Cripps told the Lower House that the UK consumed a total of 72,100 tons of newsprint in January, February and March of this year, only 26 percent of pre-war consumption, all because newspaper sizes have been reduced.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Plummet</h3>
<p>The yarn market plummeted significantly yesterday. From the opening to the close of trading, it was completely dominated by sell orders. Traders rushed to sell before others, and factories lowered prices drastically. 20-count *Shuangma* yarn plummeted by 120,000 to 130,000. Small and medium-sized 20-count and 16-count yarn also followed suit, falling by 30,000 to 50,000. At the close of trading, Tongyi Yarn Factory dumped 100 bales of 20-count special Golden Rooster yarn, priced at only 1.18 million yuan, which was the lowest recent price for large yarn.</p>
<h3>Leasing Livestock Market; Forming Joint Venture; Request from Fresh Pig Industry Association</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Since the municipal government ordered the revocation of the livestock market, it has been closed and managed by the Social Affairs Bureau. However, the original equipment of the livestock market is quite complete. Recently, due to the special situation in northern Jiangsu, the transportation of pigs has been difficult, and the pig pens in Wusong and Yunzaobang are poorly equipped. The City's Fresh Pig Industry Commercial Association believes that the livestock market has equipment for boiling oil and quarantining diseased pigs, making it the best pig pen in the city. The association has recently submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau to lease the original site and equipment of the former livestock market, and that the industry would form a joint pig pen. It is reported that preparations will begin as soon as approval is granted.</p>
<h3>Coal Industry Joint Venture Held Establishment Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Coal Industry Association jointly initiated the organization of a coal industry joint venture, which has now been prepared and held its establishment meeting yesterday morning at 9:00 AM at the industry market at 405 Tianjin Road. The organization charter was amended, and the meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM. It is reported that the venture's mission is mainly to purchase domestic and foreign coal and distribute it to actual users and dealers.</p>
<h3>Struggling Banks and Firms are Taking Steps to Adjust; The Liquidity Crunch Seems to Have Passed</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Since the Shanghai financial market suffered heavy blows from the sharp drop in the price of Unified Bonds and the period-end settlement at the end of June, the Daya Bank failed first. On the 4th and 5th of this month, market liquidity tightened sharply, and as a result, several financial institutions were threatened. Rumor has it that Dunyu Qianzhuang has been offered to Yangzi Jianye Company. Dakang Bank has been offered to Great Wall Bank. A small number of those with insufficient liquidity have also been trying to bring in powerful figures to reorganize. However, according to news from the clearing house, liquidity among the clearing banks has been easing since last Saturday. The total amount of deposits in the clearing house has reached 3 billion yuan. Therefore, it is believed that the financial turmoil has passed. Yesterday, the reporter asked Mr. Li Lixia, Director of the Business Inspection Department of Financial Institutions of the Central Bank, about the financial turmoil. According to him, the financial turmoil was not as serious as rumored outside. In total, there are more than 300 large and small financial institutions in Shanghai, and only three to five have had problems. The Central Bank's position is not to take any measures in the financial market unless absolutely necessary. Especially in the case of this event, assisting would be to reward these institutions. Mr. Li then cited the example of the turmoil in the financial market in Chongqing from the end of August to mid-September last year. At that time, because the impact was too great, the Central Bank stepped in to maintain the market, and the crisis finally subsided. Mr. Li concluded that the speculative atmosphere in Shanghai has always been stronger than elsewhere. He hopes that financial institutions will operate their businesses with stability as the main goal.</p>
<h3>Yongqing Qianzhuang Reopened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chongqing Yongqing Qianzhuang, founded by Lai Shanducheng in 1924, with a wolf's ambition, established its Shanghai branch in 1931. It withdrew automatically after the Anti-Japanese War and reopened yesterday at 108 Ningbo Road.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Cloth Market Weak: The cloth market continued to be weak due to stagnant demand and tight credit, making it difficult for the market to improve. The textile company's opening sale continued to supply V-brand at 53,500 yuan, down 500 yuan from the previous period. The rest was flat, but *Shilin* cloth from the Sichuan region had some purchasing activity, making the situation slightly better.</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Sales Brisk: Yesterday's New York American cotton telegram reported that due to inflation, prices soared 98 to 100 points per pound, with near-term cotton at US$32.06, forward cotton at US$32.30, and spot Midling cotton at US$32.71. Local raw cotton trading is becoming more brisk. The textile company handled 2,000 bales of Midling cotton, and private yarn factories such as Sulun, Jiafeng, Defeng, and Zhenxin also had considerable demand. Market prices rose another 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Hardware Sales Stagnant: Large quantities of Elephant brand shellac have recently arrived from the United States, but the quality is similar to the previous batch, and it is feared that it will still be difficult to get a good price. Many blue *hezi* belt buckles have also arrived, with prices only reaching 8,000 yuan per *he*, compared to local factory goods. The previously popular Rongchang belt buckles have faded, and no one is asking about them. The crisis in the industrial sector is becoming more serious.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Corporation Official Discusses the Soaring Sugar Prices: Direct Sales to Citizens May Begin Next Week</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The recent surge in sugar prices has drawn widespread concern, and there has been much commentary on the operations of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation. Our reporter therefore paid a special visit yesterday to Mr. Song Yixin, the manager of the corporation's department, who explained that the Far East's sugar production centers have historically been in the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and Taiwan. Due to factors such as land, climate, and labor, prices varied among these regions. Before the war, Java sugar was about three US cents per pound, while Philippine sugar was more than five cents per pound. China's annual sugar demand, excluding the Northeast, was a substantial 600,000 to 800,000 tons, mostly purchased from the Dutch East Indies, with Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. acting as the agent. As for Taiwan sugar, it was never imported before the war due to its high price. Even if small quantities occasionally appeared, they were smuggled in by the Japanese. Philippine sugar was all shipped to the United States tax-free, so China also did not import it.</p>
<p>Taiwan Sugar's Production and Sales</p>
<p>Taiwan's sugar industry, after repeated encouragement from the Japanese, did increase its production. Although initial annual production was only 300,000 tons, by 1939 it had jumped to a peak of 1.4 million tons annually. The main reason for this increase was the forced labor system implemented by the Japanese. Production decreased slightly in the following two years. After the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941, the Japanese, fearing food shortages, reduced sugarcane cultivation in Taiwan and increased the planting of miscellaneous grains. Sugar production thus drastically decreased, and by the time China took over, annual production had fallen to a low of 200,000 to 300,000 tons. The actual sugar stock at the time was 150,000 tons. From December to mid-March, another 90,000 tons of sugar were produced from existing sugarcane. Therefore, when the Taiwan Sugar Corporation began operations, it only had 240,000 tons on hand. Currently, the people of Taiwan are unwilling to plant sugarcane because rice can be harvested two or three times a year in Taiwan's climate, while sugarcane requires 18 months to harvest only once. Therefore, it is estimated that next year's production will probably be no more than 30,000 to 40,000 tons. Together with the company's existing 240,000 tons, this makes a total of 270,000 to 280,000 tons, which must sustain domestic sales for 18 months. The difficulties are numerous. Therefore, although Taiwan sugar can come to Shanghai, it is premature to say that it can defeat foreign sugar. The government deeply hopes that sugar from Cuba and other places can be imported continuously to alleviate the panic, because the 1.5 million tons of sugar accumulated in the Dutch East Indies over the past few years have been completely destroyed in the recent civil war. Java today also relies on imports to meet its sugar needs and has no possibility of selling to China.</p>
<p>Four Rounds of Sales</p>
<p>When the company was first established, it planned to ship 10,000 tons to Shanghai each month. However, due to various reasons, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had difficulties with its ships, so by July 2nd of this year, only 6,000 tons had arrived. The rising sugar price is mainly due to transportation issues. The company was established on May 1st and began distribution on the 24th. The distribution method was to group 50 bags together, which sugar trade association members would then apply to purchase. Distribution occurred once a week. In the first round, 1,000 tons were sold at 66,000 yuan per 100 catties. In the second round, 1,300 tons were sold at the same price. In the third round, 1,200 tons were sold at 66,500 yuan per 100 catties. All sugar merchants were able to purchase the full amount they applied for, with profits of approximately 10% to 15%. When the fourth round of deliveries (June 13th) occurred, the sugar merchants were informed that the company was having transportation difficulties and insufficient stock. Knowing that there were profits to be made, the amount of their applications suddenly increased to more than 4,500 tons, exceeding the company's stock by a large amount. It was then agreed with the sugar trade association to proportionally reduce the amount based on the average amount requested in the previous three rounds, and 900 tons were sold. Sugar merchants established after June 8th were refused sugar in order to prevent speculation. At that time, the market price had risen to 81,000 yuan. In order to protect national interests and prevent sugar merchants from making excessive profits, the company increased the sugar price to 73,000 yuan per 100 catties. As a result, the sugar merchants who could not buy sugar complained and focused their criticism on the company, saying that it was "not selling sugar." At the same time, the sugar price rose to 120,000 yuan per dan. The company had no choice but to ask the sugar trade association's brokers to sell directly in the market starting from June 20th, because the company did not have the authority to sell sugar at the association without going through the association's brokers. Furthermore, if the company's staff went to sell the sugar themselves, how could they avoid suspicion of bias and favoritism? Each bag of sugar cost more than 100,000 yuan, while the brokers only received a commission of 250 yuan per bag. If it is said that this 250 yuan commission increased the burden on the sugar merchants, then the increase can be said to be extremely small.</p>
<p>The company then received a telegram from Taiwan stating that a sugar ship would arrive in Shanghai around June 23rd. On June 25th, it sold all of its remaining sugar (800 tons) at a price of 98,000 yuan per dan. And because it was certain that goods would be arriving, it also sold 3,000 tons of futures contracts at 95,000 yuan per dan. Unexpectedly, just as the goods were about to arrive, people's expectations turned bearish, and sales decreased sharply due to tight credit conditions. Therefore, the sugar merchants still have 30,000 to 40,000 bags that have not been collected, and currently there are those who are opposing price drops, fearing further losses.</p>
<p>Preferential Measures for Sugar Merchants</p>
<p>In fact, the company has been working hard to protect the interests of the sugar merchants. All association members who purchase sugar receive a 1% discount and an additional two catties of sugar per bag. For those who sell and transport sugar to other ports, the company also assigns staff to handle license procedures on their behalf. Therefore, it is hoped that all sugar merchants can be self-aware and, on the one hand, ask the government to encourage Chinese people to purchase sugar from foreign countries so that China can resolve the serious sugar shortage that is coming soon.</p>
<p>Possible Direct Sales</p>
<p>Mr. Song also said that starting next week, the company will receive orders from superiors and there may be changes to the distribution method. Mr. Song also hinted at the possibility of cooperating with the municipal government to directly distribute sugar to citizens.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the head office of Taiwan Sugar Corporation came to discuss and explain the handling process and policies, which were consistent with the above, so they will not be repeated here. Reporter</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Public Works Retrospect and Prospect (Continued) (Conclusion)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Zengjue</p>
<p>Regarding Gas</p>
<p>Regarding gas, according to statistics from May of this year, the average daily output of the Shanghai Gas Company, a British-owned enterprise in the city, was 3,750,000 cubic feet. The average daily output of the Wusong Gas Plant was 60,000 cubic feet, for a total of 3,810,000 cubic feet. The total number of users of both plants was 19,615 households, with an average daily usage of approximately 200 cubic feet. However, gas usage in summer is approximately 11% less than in winter, and gas supply will become even more problematic in winter. Therefore, how to increase the gas output of the gas companies is the most pressing issue at present. The following is a brief discussion of both temporary and permanent solutions:</p>
<p>(1) First, regarding temporary solutions, they can be divided into two parts:</p>
<p>(A) Urge the Shanghai Gas Company (British-owned) and the Wusong Gas Plant to jointly supply gas to residents in the Hongkou area in the eastern district. This requires the installation of transportation stations and gas storage tanks. The detailed design is currently being studied and planned by the plant.</p>
<p>(B) The Shanghai Gas Company (British-owned) and Zhao Zengjue, the director of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, studied the possibility of using Indian coal. According to the general composition of Indian coal, the fixed carbon content is approximately 45%, volatile matter 40%, sulfide 1%, and water and ash content are quite low, approximately 1% and 13%, respectively. This is less than other types of coal, which contain 5% water and 15-22% ash. Transportation can reduce weight, and because it contains more fixed carbon and volatile matter, it can increase daily production by one million cubic feet. It also encouraged the company to add water gas equipment to achieve the purpose of supply.</p>
<p>However, before the output of the Shanghai Gas Company (British-owned) and the Wusong Gas Plant increases, all gas users in the city should save as much as possible and avoid unnecessary consumption.</p>
<p>(2) Now, regarding permanent solutions:</p>
<p>The heat energy of the gas supplied by the gas company is only 350 BTU per cubic foot, because the quality of the coal is poor. The coal currently used is Kai Zao coal. Zhongxing coal is more suitable, and Indian coal is of course better. If we can use suitable coal, the heat energy of the coal per cubic foot can be increased to 400 BTU, because we buy gas not for the gas itself, but for the heat energy.</p>
<p>Gas is the most economical and clean fuel, and it also has valuable by-products.</p>
<p>Regarding the city's gas industry in the future, it is necessary to actively expand and complete a complete high-pressure gas grid to meet the needs of the metropolis and its people. The city may be divided into three districts: (A) Wusong Zhabei district, which is supplied by the Wusong Gas Plant. (B) The former French Concession and the former International Settlement area, which is supplied by the Shanghai Gas Company (British-owned). (C) The Nanshi district, where a new plant will be set up separately to be responsible for the supply. The managers of each plant should maintain close contact with each other to avoid hindering the supply of people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>Wharves and Warehouses</p>
<p>The wharves currently under the jurisdiction of the bureau, in addition to the small wharves along the Suzhou River, include the 15 Bund wharves owned by the former Shanghai Municipal Council, the 6 astronomical observatory wharves owned by the former French Municipal Council, and the 6 wharves left by the former Japanese army, for a total of 27 wharves. Among them, 5 wharves are occupied by the US Navy, 2 wharves are occupied by the Customs, 1 wharf is occupied by the Post Office, 1 wharf has already sunk, 1 wharf is occupied by the Water Police, and 1 wharf is used for city ferries. Only 16 wharves can actually be used.</p>
<p>The Bund wharves of the former Shanghai Municipal Council were short and small, and before the war, they were only used for berthing iron lighters and small ferries. The wharves of the former French Municipal Council were only used for berthing wooden lighters and motorized boats. Now, due to the shortage of wharves, most ships are berthed at the Bund wharves.</p>
<p>According to statistics from May, a total of 2,572 iron lighters and ships, totaling 332,064 tons, were berthed at the above 16 wharves. (Wooden lighters and sailing boats are not included.) On average, 83 ships totaling over 10,700 tons were berthed daily. It is obvious that the burden on the 16 wharves to accommodate such a large number of ships cannot meet the current environment.</p>
<p>In order to provide emergency relief, we are preparing to promote the following matters as soon as possible:</p>
<p>(1) Restore the Nanshi Wharf: Before the war, there were 11 wharves in Nanshi. Only 6 wharves left by the enemy remained at the time of takeover, and they exceeded the dredged channel line by approximately 70 feet, which was not in accordance with the regulations. It is now planned to adjust the location of the above wharves and the existing wharves, for a total of 11 wharves. After the adjustment, 11 new wharves will be built on the vacated location.</p>
<p>(2) Cooperate with shipping companies or provide loans to build wharves and warehouses: As an emergency measure, it is planned to designate a certain amount of public land in a suitable location along the Pu River to cooperate with shipping companies to invest or borrow from financial institutions to build a certain number of wharves and warehouses to meet the needs.</p>
<h3>Adjusting Prices</h3>
<p>As for the permanent solution plan, it must also be coordinated with the Shanghai urban construction plan and designed precisely based on the port layout. In general, all future wharves and warehouses should be concentrated in the following locations:</p>
<p>(1) The area from Jiangwan Qiujiang Wharf to Wusong Town should be designated as a deep-water port area for berthing ocean-going ships in order to transship domestic and foreign goods and supply the factories in the area.</p>
<p>(2) The Riyuegang port connects to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and is used as a medium-sized shallow-water port, specifically for the import and export of coastal vessels and industrial raw materials.</p>
<p>(3) The wharf near the Hefeng Shipyard in Pudong will be constructed after Pudong prospers.</p>
<p>(4) The area from the mouth of the Suzhou River to Caojiadu has many factories, and the area should be arranged as a shallow-water port with wharves and warehouses.</p>
<p>The construction of the above wharves should have new-style wharf equipment. The loading and unloading of materials at each wharf should be classified and grouped, such as coal, grain, machinery, and oil, which should be loaded and unloaded in separate areas. The equipment should be the latest model, according to the nature of the goods being loaded and unloaded.</p>
<p>Commodity prices in the city continue to rise, and wages have increased sharply. The income and expenses of various public utility companies cannot be balanced, and none of them are losing money. This phenomenon not only makes investors hesitate to move forward, but also prevents the expansion of the business. Even the repair of existing equipment and the maintenance of normal operations will be impossible. In addition to accepting the company's request for reasonable adjustments, there is simply no other way.</p>
<p>Since the Bureau resumed operations, it has made three adjustments to the prices of public utilities, but all of them have adopted the method of taking into account the burden on small users and saving on large users. After careful calculation, we strive to be reasonable. The situation is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Electricity price: It is determined according to the rate of increase in coal prices. When adjusting prices last year, it was stipulated that when the coal price increases or decreases by 1,000 yuan per ton, the electricity price at all levels can increase or decrease by 2 yuan. Therefore, at the end of March and the beginning of April of this year, the allocated coal price increased to 29,970 yuan per ton, which was more than 13,000 yuan higher than before. It was approved to add 26 yuan to each kilowatt-hour of electricity at all levels, and other factors were temporarily ignored.</p>
<p>(2) Approval of water prices: First, the cost calculation books opened by various companies were collected and studied comprehensively. The minimum amount of materials and the lowest prices were used to calculate that the water price must be 120 yuan per cubic meter, so this number was used as the approved price.</p>
<p>(3) Determination of gas prices: First, all factors related to the selling price were listed in a fixed calculation formula, and then the current accurate prices of each factor were investigated and substituted into the formula to calculate a reasonable price. Based on the results of this calculation, the approved adjustment price was 400 yuan per unit.</p>
<p>(4) Streetcars and buses: Because the company's losses were too large, not only could old cars not be repaired, but also normal maintenance costs could not be maintained. Vehicle damage and lack of funds for repairs created a more serious situation, so a relatively generous price must be set. Streetcar first class: 90 yuan to 200 yuan, third class: 60 yuan to 100 yuan, trolley bus: 90 yuan to 180 yuan, bus: 100 yuan to 300 yuan. However, after the adjustment, it was stipulated that each company must set aside a considerable amount of money to rush to repair old cars, so that all vehicles can serve the public in a short period of time. At the same time, in order to take into account the burden on civil servants of municipal administrative organs and teachers and students of schools, each company was ordered to issue half-price monthly tickets to show preferential treatment.</p>
<p>(5) Telephone prices: Because the current call volume is overloaded, all equipment is difficult to cope with, and it is not easy to purchase new equipment for a while. In order to ensure that the company's revenue and expenditure are balanced and to guide citizens to use the telephone sparingly, a progressive charging method is adopted. That is, the fee for the number of calls within the specified limit is very low, and the fee for exceeding the limit is increased proportionally, so that small users with fewer calls will not be excessively burdened. The company can increase considerable income to make up for accumulated losses. (After the adjustment, the telephone fee is 25 yuan per call on average within 100 calls per month, 50 yuan per call above 100 calls, 100 yuan per call above 200 calls, 150 yuan per call above 300 calls, and 200 yuan per call above 400 calls. Public telephones are 100 yuan per call.) Public utilities should be based on service as a prerequisite, but they must also take into account the maintenance of their business. If the business is suspended, the loss and suffering suffered by the public will be even greater. Therefore, we must not ignore the burden on the public, and we must reach a compromise under the principle of taking both sides into account. As of now, the prices of water, electricity, gas, streetcars, and buses in Shanghai are cheaper than anywhere else in China.</p>

<h3>Several Questions Amidst the Anti-Epidemic Efforts</h3>
<p>— Bo Gan</p>
<p>Cholera is becoming increasingly rampant. According to the figures released by the Health Bureau, the number of patients and deaths is increasing daily. As of the 2nd of this month, there have been 1,034 patients, a figure that has reached half of the record of the major epidemic in 1926 (Year 15 of the Republic of China). Moreover, according to the usual situation in previous years, the current season has not yet entered the cholera season, or is only the beginning of the cholera season. Furthermore, according to experts' records of past cholera epidemics, Shanghai may indeed reach the cholera cycle this year. Therefore, we are urgently worried about cholera. We hope that all of Shanghai will work together to eradicate this terrible epidemic, and at the same time pay special attention to the various measures taken by the health authorities in terms of epidemic prevention.</p>
<p>The Shanghai health authorities believe that they have an unshirkable responsibility for epidemic prevention, and this attitude is truly admirable. But how many solutions the health authorities actually have, please see the following description:</p>
<p>First, regarding the vaccine issue. We remember that when the takeover began last September, cholera once occurred in Shanghai. At that time, the health authorities publicly declared that Shanghai's cholera vaccine could supply the entire city, with plenty to spare. According to common sense, Shanghai is a commercial and industrial center, and the affiliated areas of this center will naturally rely on Shanghai for items such as vaccines. In other words, Shanghai has the obligation to supply vaccines to its affiliated areas. Furthermore, from the perspective of epidemic prevention needs, in this era of frequent transportation, Shanghai and the surrounding cities are interconnected, and the boundaries cannot be self-drawn. If cholera is prevalent around Shanghai, then Shanghai will also find it difficult to guarantee its safety. If the surrounding cities need assistance in epidemic prevention, the Shanghai health authorities should generously consider it, and should not categorically refuse it. We know that the Shanghai Health Bureau has in the past supplied vaccines produced by the bureau to other provinces and cities. From this, we infer that the city's vaccine supply is not only sufficient, but indeed has a surplus. However, at this moment of tense epidemic situation, we suddenly heard that the Health Bureau prohibited the sale of vaccines to other places on the pretext of resisting the war. People believe that such measures should not be taken unless there is a shortage of inventory in the city. At the same time, therefore, we doubt: Is the vaccine produced by the Health Bureau itself sufficient for the bureau to carry out epidemic prevention work? Is the vaccine produced in Shanghai sufficient to meet Shanghai's needs without fear of shortage? The Health Bureau must have an accurate calculation on this. If the calculation results show that there is no shortage, then this calculation should be made public.</p>
<p>Second, regarding the issue of hospital beds. The number of cholera patients is increasing day by day, and several isolation hospitals are all overcrowded. According to a report on the 1st of this month, there are a total of 590 isolation beds in the city: 250 beds in the Municipal First and Second Infectious Disease Hospitals, 150 beds in the Xizang Road Epidemic Hospital, 20 beds in the Shanghai Infectious Disease Hospital, 100 beds in Guangci Hospital, and 70 beds in the Emergency Epidemic Hospital. Among them, except for Guangci Hospital, which still has more than 20 empty beds, all other hospitals have declared themselves full. The Xizang Road Epidemic Hospital has a particularly large number of patients because of its central location and historical significance. It is estimated that on the 2nd of this month, the hospital had a total of 148 inpatients and 682 outpatients. Some cholera patients, when sent to the hospital, have to be injected for a while and then sent back immediately because there are no beds available. The shortage of beds is evident here. The health authorities must be very clear about this point. We have also heard that the Health Bureau is applying for funds to build mobile wooden houses donated by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and we have also heard that the National Shanghai Medical College can lend the Zhongshan Hospital on Fenglin Bridge as an epidemic hospital if necessary. However, until now, we have only heard the Health Bureau planning and preparing, but we have not seen any additional beds actually added for cholera patients anywhere. Is the reason that it is difficult to add beds? Or is it a problem of efficiency? In the past, whenever cholera was prevalent in Shanghai, social figures would come out to organize temporary epidemic hospitals on a voluntary basis. Last year, when cholera occurred in Chongqing, many social groups also devoted themselves to this matter. Now that cholera in Shanghai has become a prairie fire, if the Health Bureau's own strength is not enough, it should quickly mobilize social forces.</p>
<p>Third, regarding the issue of funding. On the 2nd of this month, we saw a news report saying that the disinfection staff of the Health Bureau's anti-epidemic team refused to go out because half a month's salary for June had not been paid. Hearing this news would be shocking even in normal times, let alone when "epidemic prevention is like putting out a fire"! We fully understand that all agencies are currently experiencing financial difficulties, and at the same time, we hope that people who eat public meals will be willing to work even if they have to spend their own money. However, we are willing to clarify the truth about the Health Bureau's wage arrears and work stoppage. After many inquiries, we know that the various bureaus under the municipal government have paid the salaries for June according to the newly promulgated standards, but the Health Bureau, to this day, has only paid half of June's salary, and it was paid according to the old standards. At the same time, we have also heard that some staff members of the Health Bureau are working part-time in the Executive Yuan, and their head of finance is one of those working part-time, so he is often not in the bureau. We feel that, if the above is true, then today's health authorities are not only insufficient to prevent epidemics, but also insufficient to handle any official business. Just imagine, the salaries of civil servants are so meager, and they cannot be paid on time at the end of the month, how can people survive? Furthermore, regarding the allocation of funds, if an agency cannot even pay salaries on time, then other expenses can be imagined. In this situation, it is still impossible to cope with normal situations, how can it cope with emergencies?</p>
<p>The three points mentioned above are the simplest and most concrete. There are also many areas related to epidemic prevention that need to be improved or strengthened, such as publicity and education, management of food and drink, and promotion of environmental hygiene. We greatly admire the spirit of responsibility and willingness to improve that the health authorities have always expressed, but the epidemic is so rampant that empty words cannot help the reality. We hope that the health authorities will work harder.</p>

<h3>Answering Reporters' Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(1) Jin Lüzhong: In the 11th year of the Republic of China, my late father mortgaged his farmland to someone surnamed X, with a contract term of five years, and the rent was used as interest. In the 31st year, my father passed away, and I immediately, together with the original intermediary, redeemed the land from X, and both were verbally agreed. Afterwards, I repeatedly urged him, hoping to clear the formalities as soon as possible. Unexpectedly, he deliberately made excuses to delay. When I wrote to urge him again, I suddenly received a reply saying: "According to Article 8 of the Regulations on the Disposal of Real Estate, redemption is allowed within ten years from the date of signing the contract. If it is more than ten years, of course, it cannot be redeemed. Moreover, this land has been more than twenty years, and the regulations have clear provisions, and it is definitely not possible to deceive people with arbitrary judgment," and so on.</p>
<p>Judging from this, it is no longer possible to redeem it. But since redemption was agreed several times in and after the 31st year, why is it now rejected? This is obviously too deceitful and deliberately intends to embezzle it. Now I plan to sue in court. Please give your reply to the following questions: (1) According to the Regulations on Real Estate Mortgage, how many years after the date of signing the contract is it considered abandoned? (2) During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, if a reason is stated for not being able to clear it within the prescribed time limit, can it be established? (3) Is the contract price at the time of signing the contract in silver dollars or yarn dollars, and what is the calculation standard?</p>
<p>(Answer by Lawyer Cao Yaxia): (1) Ten years; (2) If the redemption period was still within the redemption period during the Anti-Japanese War, then the right of redemption can be exercised within two years after the implementation of Article 7 of the Supplementary Regulations on Civil Litigation after Recovery; (3) There is no calculation standard. The mortgagor can return the same amount of legal tender, but the mortgagee can request an increased payment in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the aforementioned regulations. If there is a dispute between the two parties, they can sue the court for a fair judgment.</p>
<p>(2) Shen Hanying asks: Before the war, the reader pawned means of livelihood and sundries to a certain gentleman. Later, due to the outbreak of the war, our place was the first to be hit, so most of the pawned items were lost. The pawn money had been paid at that time. Now, the gentleman wants to return the money and take back the items for his own use. Now there are two questions: (1) Is the pawner responsible for compensating for the items lost due to the war? (2) If responsible for compensation, can it be calculated according to the price of the items at the time of pawning? Please reply.</p>
<p>(Answer by Lawyer Cao Yaxia): (1) No responsibility for compensation for losses caused by force majeure of war. (2) For the claimant to recover, the liability for compensation is limited to the benefits received from the loss or damage.</p>
<p>(3) Chen Bokang asks: My late father passed away in November of the 26th year. He left a house that has not yet been transferred. Now I want to transfer it to my name, but the inheritance tax was not yet implemented when my father passed away. I don't know if I have to pay inheritance tax now that it is transferred?</p>
<p>(Answer by Lawyer Cao Yaxia): According to the regulations on the collection and exemption of direct taxes in the recovered areas, the inheritance tax portion of inheritance facts that occurred in the recovered areas during the period of enemy occupation (i.e., before September 2, 34th year of the Republic of China) are all exempt from inheritance tax.</p>
<h3>Wang Rongsheng of Shaoxing Visits, Newly Destitute</h3>
<p>The Hateful Pickpocket Makes People Beggars on the Spot</p>
<p>Chen Xiguang (Tiemin) brother-in-law: Your nephew came to Shanghai last month. The address, letter, and money presented to you at the station were all picked up by thieves. I only know that you live at No. 15, Jiyi Lane, but I don't know the name of the road, and there is nowhere to ask. I am adrift in Shanghai, my pockets are empty, I have no place to stay or eat, and I have no travel expenses to return to Shaoxing. I am in extreme pain. Please inquire at the entrance of the Zhonghua Times at No. 241 Nanjing Road. If any of my brother-in-law's relatives see the report, please also inform them. I will be eternally grateful. Respectfully, Wang Rongsheng from Qianqing.</p>
<h3>The New Life of Guangdong</h3>
<p>Guangdong is a fortress in South China. Whether this fortress is strong or not has a very significant impact on the entire China; therefore, the people of the whole country are expressing great concern about the situation in Guangdong Province after its recovery. Moreover, the author's concern for his hometown is more extraordinary than ordinary. Recently, I went back to Sangzi Road and lived there for more than a month. I made a more in-depth investigation of the recent administration of Guangdong Province. Now I will simply write down everything I know below for the revision of current sages.</p>
<p>Governance Lies Not in Much Talk</p>
<p>Mr. Luo Zhuoying, the chairman of the province, is a well-known man of action. In the past, his military governance was praised by the world for his constructive style. Now that he has come to Guangdong to preside over provincial affairs, he has made people recognize his character and talent even more; his view of life seems to have only one simple word "do"; and his talents are multifaceted; his foundation in old learning is very good. He has a very good understanding of the practical studies in Confucian academics. When he was a soldier, he taught his troops wherever he went. He helped the local people build roads, and even built cultural construction projects such as Confucius temples and parks. Later, in Guilin and the Youth Army in Chongqing, he used the power of the army to organize the nearby public utilities in an orderly manner. To this day, the Li Family Village in Guilin and the Daping in Chongqing still have achievements there. However, I don't want to write a biography for Mr. Luo Zhuoying here, so the reason for explaining it is to let readers know that the politics of our Guangdong can gradually embark on a new life. It is not an accidental thing.</p>
<p>In September last year, as soon as Chairman Luo arrived in Guangdong, he followed the instructions of the central government and passed five guidelines for administration at the provincial government meeting: (1) Select the virtuous and appoint the capable, and establish a clean and upright atmosphere. (2) Support agriculture and industry, and improve people's lives. (3) Strengthen county administration and consolidate the constitutional foundation. (4) Encourage science and promote modern culture. (5) Promote overseas Chinese affairs and enrich construction strength.</p>
<p>Once these guidelines were decided, they were immediately put into practice without discount, and they did not know how to be lazy. The words "singing high-sounding tunes" cannot be found in their dictionary.</p>
<p>Recalling the Past</p>
<p>Guangdong is not a simple province! Anyone familiar with the political situation will still remember it? Guangdong has always been very complicated. In addition, after seven years of enemy occupation, in order to open up and maintain the so-called mainland lifeline, the enemy cruelly destroyed all the material equipment in central and southern Guangdong. The bloody rule and exploitation of the occupied areas was far more severe than in other provinces. What's more, it was the hometown of Wang Ni and Chen Ni Bijun, who often sat in Guangzhou, and the past pseudo-provincial governors were relatives of Wang and Chen. As a result, they spread their claws and poisoned and harmed them in every possible way. Therefore, there were particularly many righteous people in Guangdong Province who fled to the interior.</p>
<p>After the victory, the righteous people flocked home; but their homes were broken, not only were their houses and furniture gone, but even the most basic farming tools were gone. As a result, the righteous people were transformed into refugees, traveling around and living a displaced life.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the recovery, Guangdong Province planned to put forward four preliminary plans: "appeasing the refugees," "restoring transportation," "clearing bandits," and "stabilizing people's livelihood." On the one hand, it made every effort to appeal to the central government for relief. After more than half a year of efforts, the broken Guangdong finally had a glimmer of hope for recovery.</p>
<p>Now, in Guangzhou alone, there are more than 280 civil dormitories that accommodate refugees. There are 17 civil canteens that provide meals for refugees. (Each meal costs only 50 yuan in national currency.) In addition, charitable organizations and the Young Women's Christian Association and other agencies have been mobilized to send meal tickets and bread to implement emergency relief.</p>
<p>Transportation in various rivers has gradually stabilized, and the righteous people have returned to various places one after another. With the help of the county government, they are all tidying up their homes or doing some small business. The social situation in various places has gradually returned to the state before the war.</p>
<p>Signs of New Life in Guangdong</p>
<p>The problem of how to build a new Guangdong is proceeding at the same time as the post-disaster work.</p>
<p>Strengthening cadres is a prerequisite for promoting the new administration. In the early days of recovery, the provincial government set up a training group to train local administrative cadres. Now, under Guanyin Mountain, behind the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, this place with rich historical significance has become the cradle of reforming Guangdong politics—commissioners and county magistrates throughout the province, as well as administrative staff in other departments, must be transferred here for training; there are few subjects in it, and they can be roughly divided into political training and professional training. At that time, the administrative expenses of the entire province were extremely tight, and this group naturally goes without saying, often the meals also had a precarious situation. But they are very energetic, even when they are so poor that they cannot eat enough, the people from top to bottom of the group are all energetic, and each one implements the proposition of "poor doing" and "doing in practice," full of new life and optimism in the tension. Chairman Luo also serves as the director of the group. Mr. Zhang Ming serves as the director of education. This Mr. Zhang is also particularly energetic. It is simply to the point of desperate. Because there are not enough houses, we need to add a few, but we don't have money; so Director Zhang launched a brick-picking campaign, stipulating that each person should pick up 100 bricks a day and bring them back. Director Zhang also personally started doing it himself, anyway, there are many ownerless broken bricks and tiles left over from the enemy's bombing. In less than a month of sweating work, the house was built. It saved more than 70% of the cost for the public.</p>
<p>I can't help but take out the two words "admire" from my heart for their spirit of doing it. With such a group of people going out to be local officials, can the local politics of Guangdong not be improved?</p>
<p>These are all spiritual fortresses in South China!</p>
<p>The Last Few Words</p>
<p>Recently, the provincial government decided on a five-year construction plan to revitalize Guangdong: 1. First priority is economic construction 1. To lay the foundation for industrialization and seek a large increase in people's food and clothing materials, so as to improve people's lives and enrich national defense strength. 2. In terms of agriculture, in addition to seeking increased grain production, attention should be paid to promoting agricultural products that earn foreign exchange. 3. Undertake economic construction projects such as water conservancy, transportation development, and mineral development. 2. Cultural construction: 1. For national education, the principle of one school per guarantee is adopted. 2. Secondary education, vocational and teacher training are equally important. 3. Pay attention to the education of border residents, so that the ethnic minorities of Guangdong can enjoy the same education. 3. Political construction: 1. Improve civil institutions. 2. Focus on public health. 3. Promote social welfare and cultivate social customs. 4. Support returned overseas Chinese and run production enterprises.</p>
<p>The above is just a summary of the plan. As for the original text, it is very long and there are many of them. I will not copy them here one by one.</p>
<p>This plan is obviously focused on economic construction, and it focuses on the industrial aspect. There are enough conditions for building an industrialized Guangdong. Let's see how to implement it. (Narrated by Xiaozhuang, recorded by Zhuoqing)</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Famine Spreads Globally! Five Hundred Million People Are Already Struggling on the Brink of Starvation</h3>
<p>— This article is written by American Secretary of Agriculture Anderson, translated by Jun Mo from Collier's magazine.</p>
<p>Insufficient Food to Relieve World Hunger</p>
<p>The United Nations Food Conference has already taken place. We may hope that they can devise some methods to prevent future famines in the world, but at present, it would be good enough to prevent the famine from becoming more serious. Because the fact is: there is not enough food in the world to alleviate this unprecedented global famine.</p>
<p>Five hundred million people are struggling on the brink of starvation. If we Americans eat a little less, if we can reduce wheat consumption by forty percent, then tens of thousands of people on the verge of death may be able to be reborn. But even so, it can only slightly alleviate the pain of the famine. It is impossible to completely drive out the famine from the world.</p>
<p>Even if food-abundant countries do their best to help them, it will still be difficult to save all five hundred million hungry people in the world. Moreover, even if we Americans are as hungry as they are today, we will never truly understand their pain, because they have endured freezing and starvation in the long years of war. Today, they can no longer endure hunger as people who used to be full. Many, many people are dying—many, many people have already starved to death, and many, many people have died because of malnutrition and difficulty resisting diseases.</p>
<p>If an American eats an extra piece of bread that he could have done without, then in fact, he is hastening the death of a person in India, China, Italy, Yugoslavia, or Australia.</p>
<p>In the first half of this year, the hungry countries in the world need 20 million tons of wheat. But the countries with a surplus of wheat in the world can export at most 12 million tons. At the same time, the rice-eating countries in the Far East, India, China, and Japan, will lack two to three times the total amount that the world can export this year.</p>
<p>Only parts of the Americas and Australia can supply a considerable amount of surplus food. In the United States, the minimum goal for the first half of the year is to export 7 million tons of wheat. Whether this goal can be exceeded or even achieved—depends entirely on whether Americans can restrain themselves.</p>
<p>It seems to be a deliberate prank of heaven that, at this time of widespread famine, the two food-producing countries in the world, Argentina and Australia, also have poor harvests due to drought. Nevertheless, there is still hope for exports. In Canada and Australia, staple foods are still rationed; in Argentina, fuel is always insufficient, and we are prepared to supply them with coal and oil so that they no longer have to burn food and vegetable oil as fuel.</p>
<p>Dying Slowly, Two Days Between Meals</p>
<p>By July 1 this year, the United States had approximately 125,000,000 bushels of wheat. So far, the weather has been exceptionally good, and this winter's wheat harvest may reach 830,000,000 bushels. Let's compare our situation with the 100 million starving people in Europe: 74% of Austrians, 43% of Finns, 75% of Germans, 59% of Italians, and 50% of Hungarians eat only a few small pieces of bread a day—this is simply slow starvation.</p>
<p>In the United States, children have lunch at school, but in many European countries, children are too hungry to study, teachers are too hungry to teach, and parents are too hungry to guide them in their homework. In the United States, children have milk at school, but in Greece, they can only mash bread in olive oil as milk. When the first batch of UN food arrived in a small Yugoslav village, the village chief slowly said:</p>
<p>"Our children eat only every other day."</p>
<p>The famine in Europe is mainly due to two reasons. The first is drought, the most severe drought in modern history, which withered the crops on both sides of the Mediterranean, North Africa, Spain, France, and the Balkans. Moreover, European land relies on fertilizers, and the war interrupted the work of fertilization. In fact, the war itself was a fatal cause: farmland became battlefields, coupled with the lack of agricultural machinery and insufficient manpower and animal power, making the European harvest extremely poor, and the destruction of inland transportation further increased the severity of the famine.</p>
<p>Disease and Death: The Price of War</p>
<p>If Europe were the only famine-stricken land, then the world's food crisis would already be serious enough, but unfortunately, other parts of the world are also in the midst of disaster.</p>
<p>Ninety percent of the world's rice is produced in the countries on the "hem of Asia"—Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam. China, Japan, Malaya, and India have always been roughly self-sufficient. But the situation this year is very bleak. Burma, formerly the world's largest rice granary, can only export 100,000 tons this year.</p>
<p>In China, more than ten million people are suffering from hunger. Many have already starved to death. More people will starve to death before the autumn harvest, because in this war-torn country, transportation has been greatly damaged in the war, and food distribution cannot keep up with the race of hunger. Hubei, Guangxi, Guangdong, and Guizhou are all lands of hunger, but none of this is more serious than Henan. There, in order to contain the last foolish attempt of the Japanese in 1945, the Yellow River embankment was opened, turning two million acres of land into a marsh, which supplied food for three million Chinese people.</p>
<p>But we must understand that this large-scale world famine is the result of a large-scale world war. It is war that destroyed farmland and disrupted transportation. After every large-scale conflict, the world sees that the price of war is famine, disease, and death. Let us hope that mankind can remember this lesson before the next war breaks out.</p>
<h3>The "Glass" Age</h3>
<p>British and American scientists have repeatedly said: "Almost nothing cannot be made of glass plastic." Indeed, look: glass belts, glass raincoats, glass handbags, glass leather shoes, glass combs, glass... If atomic bombs hadn't been created at this time, everyone would probably be shouting, "The Glass Age has arrived!"</p>
<p>In reality, the "Glass Age" has indeed arrived. American and British industrialists are working hard to manufacture glass plastics to meet the large-scale needs after the war.</p>
<p>In fact, the glass products we see... are just luxury goods. What China really needs is not these kinds of luxury goods, but rather radios, telephones, and electrical appliances made of glass plastics.</p>
<p>Large factories in England are mass-producing glass plastic radios, telephones, electrical appliances, auto parts, and building materials. Many complex parts are molded into a single piece using glass plastics, making manufacturing simple and durable. When manufacturing plastic utensils, they are mostly pressed with a press, with each square inch of plastic subject to a pressure of several tons to dozens of tons. One press uses a pressure of 75 tons per square inch to manufacture glass combs, producing hundreds of them per hour. Another factory produces thousands of plastic telephones and radios each week. One type of plastic is simply indistinguishable from ordinary glass, and another type of plastic can be used as optical glass. In England alone, there are 40,000 workers engaged in this industry. The speed of development of the plastics industry is truly astonishing. At present, it has become the most fashionable industry. We are preparing to welcome the arrival of the "Glass Age"!</p>
<h3>Another New Invention</h3>
<p>Tooth decay is a very common problem, but it can have a very serious impact on human health. Famous dentist Dr. Gottlieb has invented several inexpensive chemical drugs. After brushing your teeth with these drugs, you can guarantee that you will not suffer from tooth decay within an hour, with an effectiveness of 90 to 100 percent.</p>
<p>This doctor is sixty-one years old, originally from Austria, and fled to the United States when the German army occupied the country.</p>
<h3>Accurate Statistics</h3>
<p>Soviet Army Removes German Machinery</p>
<p>How much industrial equipment did the Soviets actually remove from the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany? This is a question of great concern to the military administration and even journalists. Last week, "Newsweek" obtained a relatively accurate estimate from the files provided by the Military Government's Industrial and Military Administration Department, the figures are as follows:</p>
<p>50% of metal factory equipment was removed; 80% of alkali manufacturing plants were removed; 70% of nitric acid plants were removed; 50% of caustic soda factories were removed; 75% of other chemical plants were removed; 100% of celluloid factories were removed; 60% of paper mills were removed; 80% of sugar refineries were removed.</p>
<p>It is said that the Soviet side also removed 2,000 kilometers of railway track (equivalent to 1,240 miles), and in fact, the number may be even higher.</p>
<h3>Atomic Bomb Test Results: Neither Too Good Nor Too Bad; The Bomber's Mistake Will Be Regretted Forever</h3>
<p>— Translated and Narrated by Zuo Xi</p>
<p>In this joint US Army, Navy, and Air Force atomic bomb test held at Bikini Atoll, there are many different opinions from people of various countries regarding the test results, and there is no consensus. The following is a translation of the personal impressions mentioned by six special reporters from the United Press who witnessed the bombing from the air and sea from various angles, for consideration.</p>
<p>The first reporter, Bartholomew, was soaring over Bikini Island when the atomic bomb fell. He said: "Looking down from the air, the situation was far different from what was predicted at first, which inevitably makes people disappointed. But the next day, looking down at the panoramic view of the bombed target from a low-flying plane, I found that the affected area was very large, and the extent of the damage was very severe. The reason why people feel disappointed is just like an excellent movie, which is hyped too much beforehand, and when you see it, you feel it is bland."</p>
<p>The second reporter, Terry, participated in the atomic bomb test aboard the United Press special ship Appella Jiang, saying: "The atomic bomb is terrifying, even when viewed from twenty miles away. No military weapon in the world can produce such a huge flash, and it can sink five ships and damage more than forty other ships with one blow."</p>
<p>The third reporter, Myer, observed the bombing from the flagship of Lieutenant General Blandy, saying: "I dare say that the destructive power and fierce scene of this bomb fully meet all the reports, although it pales in comparison to the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. My impression is that this test was not very successful in terms of scientific research, for two reasons: the bomb did not hit the Nevada, but sank the Gillen, a military ship carrying important instruments."</p>
<p>The fourth reporter, Pennyhoff, said: "Bomber Major Wood failed to drop the bomb within 500 feet of the target ship, resulting in the fourth atomic bomb in history failing to achieve its full extent of damage and provide the expected scientific data. In fact, it exploded in mid-air, which is not very clever in the strategy of attacking naval ships."</p>
<p>The fifth reporter, Moller, observed from the observation ship Panamint, saying: "Calmly speaking, the firepower of that bomb was much smaller than initially expected, but after inspecting the lagoon on the ground, my emphasis on that bomb increased accordingly. Based on my observations in Japan, this bomb has the same destructive power as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Because the buildings there are fragile and the population is dense, the superficial losses seem to be greater. But this bomb does not seem as fierce and terrifying as the one in Nagasaki."</p>
<p>The sixth reporter, who observed from the Appella Jiang special ship, said: "My impression of this test is one of disappointment, because there was nothing surprising except for the usual mushroom-shaped smoke column. However, I believe that although the bomb is not as terrifying as ideal, it is ultimately a fierce weapon against the fleet."</p>

<h3>Hymns</h3>
<p>— Liang Youting</p>
<p>Religion and art have been connected.</p>
<p>Indeed, religion has made use of art, as Mr. Feng Zikai said, in the Middle Ages, music was the slave of religion. But many arts also rely on religion to spread. A chapel combines the arts of architecture, sculpture, fine arts, and poetry (hymns) as a tool for preaching. They use that magnificent architecture, majestic arrangement, and solemn singing to create a psychological reaction when you walk into the chapel, making you feel the sublime and greatness of the environment, and the moving sound of the singing, making you feel smaller and smaller. This is the intention of the missionaries. If you look at the independence of art, of course, art has been captured and used as an accessory; but after each major war, art can still be preserved, and this cannot be attributed to religion. Just as after music and words are combined, the music itself becomes an accessory to the beautiful words, but without the combination of literature, the melodious melody and gorgeous harmony feel without attachment. The emergence of "Program Music" is also due to this.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is no need to be hostile to religious music. I think that the upright melody and calm rhythm can indeed nourish our souls. People in the city are constantly competing for fame and fortune all day long, and their nerves are constantly tense, and they really need to have opportunities to clear their minds often. Even if you are not willing to mechanically go to church, if you can take the time to listen to or sing a hymn in your daily life, in the clear morning when you get up, or in the night before going to sleep, it will definitely give your mind a vision of goodness and beauty. We do not have to believe in the soul and heaven, but if you assume that the magnificent singing comes from the distant "heaven," and that heaven symbolizes a sacred realm, then the mind entangled with troubles and pain will suddenly calm down and have a far-reaching sustenance. I often feel that the form of religion is very beautiful, and the content is very good. Although we do not necessarily believe in it, we can often appreciate its beauty and yearn for its goodness. This is actually one of the ways to enjoy life.</p>
<p>Don't think that religious music belongs to religion. In fact, the melodies of hymns were not originally written for hymns; many hymn scores were originally the crystallization of the hard work of famous musicians or famous folk songs, and religious people took these artistic essences to use as religious tools. For example, the famous hymn Holy Night, its score was originally a German folk song, and the ancient Chinese songs "Man Jiang Hong" and "Yangguan Sandie" have also been included in hymn collections. Therefore, religious music is originally very good music, and it should not be discriminated against just because it is given a religious color.</p>
<p>However, some people complain that hymns are too "monotonous" and feel boring; I remember that at the music festival the year before last, we held a concert in the rear, and there was a short chorus of religious songs, and the listeners impatiently said: "Let's go to church!" This is just like the reason why many people can only accept Jazz. Of course, I do not deny that listening to too many hymns can also be tiring, but treating it as a part of your musical hobby program—that is, a part of your daily life—must be very beneficial.</p>
<p>I appreciate hymns.</p>
<h3>In Memoriam</h3>
<p>— Yao Naiyu</p>
<p>Xueyan, my child! I never imagined that after enduring eight years of suffering, you would end your life so hastily. Eight years ago today, your mother and I, carrying you unborn, reluctantly left Shanghai. And eight years later, we finally returned home for a family reunion, only for you to quietly leave this world!</p>
<p>I recall last year, when we returned to Shanghai and then back to our hometown, how fortunate and joyous we felt! After enduring these long years, we finally saw the hometown we had dreamed of for eight years. Your grandmother greeted us at the door, suppressing the tears that welled up when she saw her two granddaughters, you and your sister Bingzhi. Then, you shyly called out "Grandma," making her so happy that she picked you up and stroked you with her withered hands, forgetting the hardships, pain, and all the wounds she had suffered under the enemy's iron heels for eight years. Child, I secretly rejoiced for you and blessed your grandmother.</p>
<p>You lived in the countryside for over four months, mainly because I couldn't find a house in Shanghai. But the rural life was beneficial to your frail body. When school started, you entered the local elementary school. You began to recognize those unfamiliar children and the faces of the villagers. Your inherent intelligence and gentle nature won the love and praise of everyone. Child! The hometown retained the simple old customs of the eighteenth century. People were diligent and frugal, not inclined to meddle in others' affairs, especially those of a girl from another family, which they considered unworthy of discussion. But, child, you were like a handful of fine sand thrown onto the calm surface of the hometown lake, stirring up a beautiful ripple. You stirred their ancient nerves, causing them to spend some time each day talking about you. You created a miracle in the hometown.</p>
<p>The hometown was close to Shanghai. Every Sunday, when I had time, I would ride my bicycle back to see you. You would always be like when I returned home from work, holding Bingzhi's hand, jumping and shouting, "Daddy's here!" to welcome me. When I left home, you would wave your hand and shout, "Goodbye, Daddy." You seemed very happy and satisfied with life in the hometown. But your mother told me that you often secretly asked her, "Has Daddy found a house yet?" or "Why hasn't Daddy found a house yet?" Child, I understood your feelings. Although you were welcomed and praised by the hometown, your heart often flew to my side. So I tried my best to ask people everywhere to help me find a house, and finally found one at the beginning of last month. On the twelfth, I took you from the countryside to Shanghai. For the sake of your schoolwork, I had tried to let you finish this semester in the hometown before leaving, but you were unwilling under any circumstances. I couldn't bear to go against your wishes, because you had never left me before! Who knew that you would fall ill only ten days after arriving in Shanghai. The Western doctor said your illness was chronic meningitis—an incurable disease! The Chinese doctor said it was damp-heat disease and prescribed medicine for you, but it was also ineffective. You finally left me. I regret that my months of rushing around ruined your little life!</p>
<p>When you were dying, I returned you to the hometown for the last time, forever. Many people who loved you came to see you. Many people who loved you shed tears and called out your name. But your bright eyes would no longer twinkle, no longer recognize those faces that had once been unfamiliar but had become intimate. Your thin lips would no longer softly call out "Daddy." At 12:50 PM on June 8th, you took your last breath!</p>
<p>Child! You are gone. You lay quietly on the wooden board. Aunt Fang put on makeup for you and dressed you in your favorite red qipao. She combed your long, black hair and braided it into two smooth little braids, tied with red silk ribbons, just like the first time you returned to the hometown. You were still so beautiful, so exquisite. Child ah! Who says you are dead? I wonder if my nerves are failing. I rushed up to kiss you, but the people around dragged me away. Someone was burning your clothes, and the flames blazed, illuminating the room. I stared at the terrifying fire. It burned your beautiful clothes, and it burned my heart, but it couldn't ignite the beating of your heart.</p>
<p>I sat on the threshold of the east wing, staring blankly at your black and lovely little braids, which contained the stories of the past eight years, displayed before my eyes scene by scene. You grew up in a mountain city by the sea. That vast sea and the soft beach were what you often longed for. We had spent three years and ten months there living on borrowed money. Later, we crossed four provinces and nine major cities. We were once on a Yangtze River ferry, where everyone was scrambling to cross. For your safety, I broke my rule and argued with people, almost resorting to violence. Because there was no food, you once ate peanut cakes to satisfy your hunger, which only made you hungry for two days. In different locations in a big city, you and I were simultaneously attacked from the air, but luckily we were unharmed. You once secretly shed tears because I was whipped by the enemy, not letting me know. You sometimes had palpitations and insomnia because of excessive fright. You... child, all these unbearable memories, you have made me relive—and will forever relive again and again in grief!</p>
<p>Child, school is dismissed for the evening. Your little friends are carrying their schoolbags and passing in front of our house. Their cries startled them, and they stopped curiously, holding their schoolbags and looking inside. Child, I opened your schoolbag for you: in addition to two textbooks issued by the school, there was a pencil box and a doll that I had recently bought for you. On the first page of your notebook, you copied "Sun Yat-sen's hometown is..." On your arithmetic book were the last arithmetic problems I had given you. I seemed to see your hand waving, writing in the book. But your hand will never wave again after all. You were put into that wooden box that takes away the laughter of the world. I gently placed your schoolbag beside you. I cried out to you bitterly, child, but you no longer say "Goodbye, Daddy"!</p>
<p>Child, you are gone! Your death may be indifferent to this world, but to me, it is an irreparable wound. You took away your wisdom, your gentleness, and you also took away the miracle you created in the hometown. Eight years of cuddling together ended with the end of your life. But I will always remember all of this, always remember all of this, always remember you!</p>
<h3>Mother and Child</h3>
<p>— Xie Zi</p>
<p>"If she is a wall, we will build silver battlements on her, and if she is a door, we will enclose her with panels of cedar..." This passage is particularly familiar to me. It must have been about two years ago. One day, after we had finished our evening chores, Mother suddenly opened the Song of Songs in the Old Testament and asked me to read to her the marked passages and try to explain them. But I had never read this chapter before. I never thought there would be such words in the Bible!</p>
<p>"I really don't understand, Mother," I said embarrassedly, "and I don't need to understand either!"</p>
<p>"No, you need to understand. Otherwise, you won't understand how much I love you." She smiled gently—what a gentle solemnity! "My dear child," she stroked my hair and let me lie on her lap. "I went to your room to see you the night before last. You didn't know, did you?"</p>
<p>"The night before last? Was it the night of the heavy rain, Mother?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I was thinking of you because it was raining and cold. Why didn't you even close the window or turn off the light? Were you asleep when you didn't want to fall asleep?" She paused and then said, "Did you have any dreams that night, my Mei?"</p>
<p>I looked up at Mother, who was also smiling at me.</p>
<p>"No," I said, "I can't remember."</p>
<p>"But I still remember for you! Wasn't that a very annoying dream? Alas! When I went to cover you with a blanket, you were simply a weepy child. Your eyes were full of tears, and even your pillow was half wet. At the time, I really wanted to wake you up and ask you what was going on. Or at least I could free you from the annoying dream. But after thinking about it, I didn't do that. I know there won't be any other reason for this. You have always been raised in a clear family, haven't you?" As she said this, her voice was simply as gentle as a whisper. "When you were in swaddling clothes, I guessed that you were an emotional daughter. But, my child, this kind of character, added to a mother's love, will certainly turn into pity. Added to a mother's responsibility, it becomes a heavy burden."</p>
<p>I lay in silence, like a two or three-year-old child. I felt that since that day, Mother had been particularly kind to me. It was really more than just kindness. How should I say it? I have seen many people's families, where it seems like there is no sunlight. But me, am I dreaming? Can I enjoy such close love in this world?</p>
<p>Mother just came again. "You're not asleep yet?" She said in a soft surprise.</p>
<p>"I was thinking about you, Mother." At this moment of perfect understanding, I was almost moved to tears. "Brother just came back. He said he wanted to come and see you. I told him you were already asleep. I didn't expect you to be pondering here! But you should go to sleep, Mother," I said gently, "Look, the moonlight is already filling the window!"</p>
<h3>Two Mothers</h3>
<p>— Zhongyuan</p>
<p>Recently, I saw a letter written by a deeply religious mother in her forties to her only son. The son was already twenty years old, strong and healthy, and studying at a certain university. One day, he suddenly sent a quick letter home, saying that he had been admitted to a certain army and would soon go abroad for training. The mother calmly read her son's letter several times and immediately wrote a reply to her son. She wrote:</p>
<p>"If you are going to save people and love people, even if you drift to the ends of the earth and never come back, I will never be reluctant to let you go. But if you are going to train to kill people, train to shed blood, I don't think this is God's will, and I will do everything in my power to stop you!"</p>
<p>Seeing this mother, one can't help but think of another mother, the very famous Spartan woman in the storybooks: In the past, when Sparta was at war with another country, a woman first sent her eldest son to the battlefield. Soon, he died in battle, and when the bad news came, she was not sad at all. She immediately sent her second son to the battlefield. Soon, he also died in battle, and she was still not sad. She sent her third son to the battlefield, but soon the third son also died in battle. This time, when the bad news came, the woman wailed loudly. People asked her why she was so sad this time. She replied, "I only had three sons in total. Now they are all dead, and I no longer have a son who can fight and sacrifice for the country!"</p>
<p>Two mothers, one who loves peace and opposes bloodshed, and one who is bravely patriotic and not afraid of sacrifice. We cannot deny that they are both great. However, the concept of right and wrong varies according to time and place. In today's world, of course, the Spartan mother is greater. Otherwise, you love peace and are afraid of killing and bloodshed, and you stop your son from joining the army; but others do not love peace and are not afraid of killing and bloodshed, and encourage their son to fight you, then wouldn't you just sit and wait for death?</p>
<p>But even if that is the case, we might as well have an ideal.</p>
<p>I often close my eyes and imagine: If one day, every mother in the world, like this mother who loves peace and opposes bloodshed, does everything in her power to stop her son from joining the army, then what a happy and lovely world will be created!</p>

<h3>Double Flying Swallows (18)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Lihua's status has not only risen in the theater, but also at home. Regarding the profits she earns, she does not ask or interfere, and everything is handled by Mrs. Mo. But regarding her personal actions, Mrs. Mo cannot excessively inquire. For example, she likes to read; she does not want to go out for social events; Mrs. Mo must not interfere with these things. This minimum right is what she has earned in exchange for the profits she brings to Mrs. Mo, and it is a little progress in her life in recent years. She is no longer like before, completely at the mercy of Mrs. Mo, a puppet to be manipulated. Now, she has finally redeemed a part of "herself" from Mrs. Mo's palm, and Mrs. Mo has to accommodate her to some extent. She has become silent, serious, and dignified! Whether in the theater or at home, she hardly pays attention to those colleagues who are seven parts ghost and three parts human; she also rarely pays attention to Zhang Xian and Mrs. Mo; even Liyun. On stage, she is doing it for "duty," crying, laughing, speaking, and singing; off stage, she is a mute who does not speak. Others can do nothing about her, and dare not do anything about her. This is another little progress in her spirit, she is able to make people respect her!</p>
<p>Only Zhang Xian, this kid, still does not change his old ways, often trying to tease Lihua with a playful smile. Because he relies on the fact that he is Lihua's teacher, and Lihua cannot scold him. And he relies on the fact that Lihua needs him to play the huqin, and Lihua cannot leave him. Therefore, others are afraid of Lihua, but he is not afraid! Others respect Lihua, but he does not respect her! This makes Lihua very painful. She has negotiated with Mrs. Mo several times to dismiss Zhang Xian, but Mrs. Mo refuses. Mrs. Mo knows that half of Lihua's success depends on this huqin. But if Lihua gets angry and threatens Mrs. Mo that she will not sing anymore, Mrs. Mo will also gently persuade Zhang Xian with kind words. Zhang Xian knows Lihua's temper and does not dare to provoke her too much, but he will never easily give up on this beautiful flower that has yet to bloom!</p>
<p>In this way, Lihua spent her fourteenth year in a seemingly peaceful, yet not peaceful, living environment. Suddenly, there was an unusual commotion in Beijing, followed by war and chaos, and people were panicked! A few days later, the flames of war blazed, and the sound of artillery rumbled!</p>

<h3>News Snippets</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>In President Song's press conference, there were several places where the news was unclear, and I will now make a supplement.</p>
<p>President Song said: I have presided over the Bank of China for nine years, and I have never appointed a single private individual. If you don't believe it, you can investigate. I believe that those who can be law-abiding, diligent in their duties, are my people. Taking the directors of the three enemy and puppet property disposal bureaus established after the victory as an example, Liu Gongyun used to be a colleague of the Bank of China. At that time, he opposed me, but I still use him now because he is honest, brave, willing to work, and responsible. Sun Yueqi and Lin Jiyong, I definitely did not know them beforehand. Someone said they were good, so I used them. I didn't meet them until they took over the job.</p>
<p>President Song said: Public and teaching personnel are indeed too hard. Among them, the best are selling clothes to maintain their lives, and the second best are complaining. Those who complain are also good people. There is also a third group, and that is corruption.</p>
<p>President Song said: When Japan surrendered, there were a total of 3.5 million spindles. The original yarn factories had fallen into a difficult situation to operate. Knowing that the yarn price would definitely rise after receiving them, why did the government sell these spindles and let a few people gain huge profits? The government has no such obligation. Rather than letting a few people make windfall profits, it is better to make it contribute to the country's finances.</p>
<p>The press conference adopted a numbered seating arrangement, with cigarettes, snacks, and coffee on the seats. One question followed another, and the questioners were very enthusiastic and passionate. As soon as the questioner sat down, President Song immediately stood up to answer, quickly, directly, and very sincerely. The scene was indeed moving. If President Song didn't have other business, if it was extended, it might not have ended until dark.</p>
<h3>Where is the Rice?</h3>
<p>— Shijing</p>
<p>I remember Mayor Wu said at the Tsinghua Alumni Association: Every time I participate in an alumni association, the rice crisis will be suppressed once. This time, the rice crisis has been going on for more than a week, and I have not seen the wise mayor come up with a way to suppress it. I think this must be because the Tsinghua Alumni Association has not yet held a meeting! Otherwise, the rice crisis would have been suppressed long ago.</p>
<p>It is a fact that the city government distributes rice to rice shops (reported on July 5 that the city government distributed more than 7,000 bags of rice to rice shops). It is also a fact that all the large and small rice shops in Shanghai have their doors open, but there is not a single grain of rice in the shops for more than a week. It is also a fact that the common people take the banknotes issued by the National Bank, but they cannot buy rice in the rice shops. Even if there are occasional rice vendors on the streets and alleys carrying a few dou of rice, they are sold out in a rush due to scarcity and competition, and the price is more than double the usual price, which is beyond the reach of poor scholars like us. Moreover, this situation does not happen every day, forming an abnormal phenomenon where money cannot buy rice. The common people are panicking that there will be a day when they have no rice to eat, because we are ultimately Chinese and should eat Chinese rice, and we cannot change our daily lifestyle to eat Western food. This problem is really too serious. We citizens cannot help but shout loudly: "May I ask the mayor, where has the rice gone"!</p>
<h3>Seventy Years of Telegraphs</h3>
<p>— Xi Ju</p>
<p>The installation of telegraph equipment in our country has not even reached seventy years yet. The laying of telegraph lines began with the Shanghai-Songjiang line, and the company responsible for its operation was the Great Northern Telegraph Company, a Danish trading house. In the thirteenth year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing dynasty, the Governor-General of Liangjiang, Shen Baozhen, submitted a memorial detailing the benefits of telegraphs, but it was not implemented due to certain circumstances. In practice, China's own self-established telegraph line dates back to the second year of the Guangxu reign. In that year, Li Hongzhang laid a telegraph line from Tianjin to the Dagu Beicang Fort, marking the beginning of China's self-managed telegraph service.</p>
<p>The telegraph entered China during the Tongzhi and Guangxu reigns, primarily managed by the Danish Great Northern Telegraph Company. At that time, maritime transport between China and foreign countries had been established, and novel foreign objects were continuously introduced to China. While foreign guns and cannons were previously unknown, foreign dragons (fire engines), kerosene, and gas were also considered novelties. As for telegraphic communication, it was even regarded as an unbelievable act of ghosts and spirits. After the successful opening of the Great Northern Telegraph line, an announcement was first published in the Shenbao newspaper of the second year of the Guangxu reign, seventy years ago. The text read: "In recent years, the ingenuity of Western methods is unparalleled by telegraphs. Over tens of thousands of miles across the ocean, ordinary letters take months to arrive, but now they can be delivered instantly. Even if it is thousands of miles away, a response can be received in an instant. Therefore, all countries have established telegraph services. In the imperial court, they transmit confidential and important matters. In commerce, they transmit market prices of goods. It is indeed a most ingenious and essential method..." At that time, various Western studies had not yet spread to China, so the telegraph service was regarded by the public as a "clairaudient."</p>
<p>The Great Northern Telegraph Company belonged to the Danish Jing Shi Telegraph Company. Around the time of the signing of the Five Ports Treaty, it established telegraph lines in several trading ports in China and Japan. In its published advertisements, it specified that "Wusong Seaport, Snake Island, Xiamen, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, New Gold Mountain (now Melbourne), Nagasaki, Yokohama, Kobe, Hakodate, and even India, Europe, and America are all reachable. To facilitate communication for the Chinese, the company also hired specialists to compile a telegraph codebook, as evidenced by this advertisement. The text reads: "Our company has now created a Chinese character telegraph book, convenient for Chinese people to understand its use. The method involves using numbers to represent Chinese characters. This book is available at our company and various branches. Those who wish to send telegrams to our offices will receive a free copy of the book, along with a detailed explanation of its wonders. There is also a price list for sending telegrams to various distances, so that one can know the cost at a glance."</p>
<p>By the sixth year of the Guangxu reign, Li Hongzhang again petitioned for the allocation of 178,700 taels of silver to establish the Northern and Southern Seas Telegraph, laying the Shanghai-Tianjin line and establishing seven telegraph offices in Tianjin, Dagu, Jining, Qingjiang, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, and Shanghai. On the twenty-fourth day of the twelfth month of that year, the entire line began operation. In the eighth year of the Guangxu reign, another line was extended westward along the Yangtze River from Zhenjiang to Nanjing, passing through Wuhu and reaching Hankou. It took two years to complete the project. In January of the tenth year, it was further extended to connect with Hong Kong. In October of the same year, the Shanghai-Guangzhou line was also constructed by the Qing government. To the north, the line was extended from Tianjin to Beijing, and from there to Shanhaiguan and Baoding, with two branch lines from Jinan reaching Zhifu and Qingdao. These were all matters of the tenth year of the Guangxu reign. By the twenty-third year of the Guangxu reign, the line from Beijing across Mongolia to Kyakhta was completed, and our country's land line to Europe was thus completed.</p>
<p>After the national government established its capital in Nanjing, national unification was achieved in the summer of the following year. A national transportation conference was convened, and given the facilities and contracts of the Great Northern, Yangtze River, and Pacific submarine cable companies over the years, which were deemed extremely unfair, after various negotiations (the contracts expired on December 31st of the nineteenth year), the receiving and sending offices of the three companies were taken over. Thus, the Chinese Telegraph Bureau was unified. In total, the Chinese telecommunications industry, from its inception to the present, is less than seventy years old. Now, not only can the entire country communicate by telegraph, but wireless radio stations and broadcasting stations have also sprung up everywhere, its development cannot be considered slow. However, today, the United Kingdom and the United States have already entered the business phase of wireless radio image transmission and wireless radio films from the experimental stage. It is hoped that the Chinese people will catch up quickly to avoid being left far behind everywhere..."</p>
<h3>The Beginning of Prostitute Inspection in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Xi Ju</p>
<p>Reports state that the Shanghai Municipal Police Department has already ordered the registration of prostitutes in Shanghai. Meanwhile, another source claims that the number of American soldiers stationed in Shanghai suffering from venereal diseases has increased sharply, and has sent a letter requesting our government's assistance in solving this problem. Recalling two or three months ago, He Chuqin also mentioned the serious problem of sexually transmitted diseases in the military in his report, urging all parties to pay attention. It is understood that the Shanghai health authorities, in order to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, will intensify the inspection of prostitutes in the city on the negative side, and are planning to add sexually transmitted disease hospitals on the positive side, in order to eradicate venereal disease bacteria.</p>
<p>The system of public prostitution in Shanghai began, and the history is no longer verifiable, but the Shanghai Municipal Council's proposal to inspect prostitutes dates back to the fifth day of the sixth month of the second year of the Guangxu reign, in the year of Bingzi. According to the Shenbao newspaper of the thirteenth day of the sixth month of that year: "On the fifth day of the month, the Shanghai Municipal Council held a meeting, not only merchants were present, but also Consul Macgregor, the naval commander, and the naval doctor of the Municipal Council were also present. The matter discussed was that prostitutes may be infected with venereal diseases, which are bound to be transmitted to others. It is necessary to open a hall and have doctors examine each person. Those who are free of disease will be allowed to work as prostitutes. Those who are infected will have their licenses revoked and be ordered to be treated in the medical hall. They will be allowed to receive customers again after recovery. This measure already exists in Hong Kong, and the procedures are roughly similar. From my humble opinion, the matter is for the sake of the 'salty water girls' (note: prostitutes who specialize in receiving foreign sailors). It is feared that sailors who are intimate with them may contract sores or venereal diseases, and be unable to exert their efforts in their duties." It is said that the Shanghai Municipal Council did not order the "Shu Yu," "Chang San," "Yao Er," and "Hua Yan Jian" prostitutes to be inspected one by one at that time. The reason was obviously that the patrons of the above-mentioned prostitutes were all Chinese, and had nothing to do with foreigners, and a laissez-faire policy was adopted. The last paragraph of the article also stated: "If these 'Shu Yu,' 'Chang San,' 'Yao Er,' and 'Hua Yan Jian' are also to be inspected one by one, it would inevitably be a chaotic and shameful scene. It is now planned to conduct a trial run first, and then decide how much the expenses will be before making a final decision."</p>
<p>On the fifteenth day of the same month, the Shenbao newspaper published a commentary on the inspection of prostitutes, saying: "Western doctors inspecting prostitutes seems quite indecent to the Chinese, but Westerners consider it a commendable act. More than ten years ago, various Western countries believed that human desires are inherent in nature, but if they are indulged without restraint, disasters will inevitably befall the body. This is a self-inflicted sin, and heaven uses it as a warning, which the state need not interfere with. Later, after the state carefully investigated, it was found that prostitutes have more contacts and are more likely to be infected. Once sailors, soldiers, and other personnel are intimate with them, they will transmit the infection. The minor cases will develop sores and toxins, and the major cases will damage life and lead to infertility. The ignorant and foolish are pitiable. Therefore, special regulations are made to establish bureaus and assign doctors to examine them. Prostitutes who are found to be infected will be given careful treatment. Once they are cured, they will be sent back. If there are those who do not want to be prostitutes again, the bureau will help them find suitable matches and marry them off. Many prostitutes have thus been removed from the register and escaped from the fiery pit. Now, various ports in the West are following suit, and all are well-managed. This measure not only protects many prostitutes, but also benefits the military and civilians alike. The Shanghai Municipal Council's proposal to implement it is a practical move, silently embodying the beauty of creation. It is hoped that those who hear and see it will not treat it as a strange thing."</p>
<p>Currently, our country does not have a clear policy on the issue of prostitution at the central level. Some cities have adopted a laissez-faire policy, while others have banned prostitution. Regardless of which is considered the better policy, the inspection of prostitutes is not only reasonable, but also necessary. After the war, all countries in the world are suffering from rampant venereal diseases. Although our country does not have accurate statistics, its spread is widespread and has already reached remote rural areas. If it is not eradicated urgently, the health of the nation will be threatened in the future. Therefore, the inspection of prostitutes is not only a matter of urgency, but should also be followed nationwide, so as to avoid the danger of extinction and national decline.</p>

<h3>Travel to the Moon</h3>
<p>— Dongfang Jing</p>
<p>Long before "radar" made contact with the moon, more than a thousand people in the United States had planned to travel to the moon. These visionary people belong to the "American Rocket Society" - a non-profit organization; founded in Illinois in 1942. Members include engineers, astronomers, chemists, and other scientists, both professional and amateur. It is the largest "rocket craze" group in the world.</p>
<p>According to past estimates by the vice president of the society, a rocket ship traveling to the moon would cost about US$25 million. Now, with the application of atomic energy, the cost has been reduced to US$300,000. Atomic energy will also reduce the supply of fuel to accommodate more crew and other instruments.</p>
<p>This group believes that in the post-war world, lunar travel will surely be realized. Let's wait and see the realization of this miracle!</p>

<h3>Changing Places is Good - Honest and Weak</h3>
<p>— Wuling Ren</p>
<p>There was a man who did not see his elder brother for many years. When he became an official, the official ordered him to call out "brother" a hundred times in court. The man's conscience was moved, and he embraced his brother and wept bitterly, and they eventually reconciled. As the saying goes, "Seeing each other brings three points of affection," especially for siblings. However, there are exceptions, which is truly incomprehensible.</p>
<p>A large number of county magistrates in Zhejiang Province have been accepted by the Zhejiang Higher People's Court for committing crimes of corruption and dereliction of duty. Among them, three are still working as county magistrates in various counties in Jiangsu Province, and have been doing so for quite some time. It seems that they are getting along quite well. Can a county magistrate maintain integrity? Is it also related to whether the person and place are suitable or unsuitable? Or is it because Zhejiang is designated as the "Year of Law and Discipline" this year that a large number of corrupt officials have been reported?</p>
<p>Most rice shops in Hongkou have no rice for sale, causing great distress to the citizens living in Hongkou; the only solution is to move. Fortunately, there are plenty of rice shops in Nanshi, Zhabei, and Xujiahui. Perhaps not living in Hongkou will allow one to buy rice?</p>

<p>A correspondence from Taiwan says that life there is better. Many people who go to Taiwan seem to be able to cope economically like Americans in China. In fact, Americans in Shanghai are now complaining bitterly. Sailors on warships sell daily necessities, and can be seen along the road, almost selling their pants. If it were eight or nine years ago, it would have been a joke, but now it is no longer surprising.</p>
<h3>Humorous Sketches</h3>
<p>— Jiang Ping</p>
<p>After the court sentenced Little Peter and Big Peter to twenty years of imprisonment each; Little Peter straightened his chest and said confidently: "Big Peter is already fifty years old this year, but I am only twenty years old. I believe Big Peter has at most two or three years of life left, so he will at most serve two or three years of his sentence. But I am still a young man, so my life will certainly not be shorter than Big Peter's. So, if you calculate it this way, Big Peter will only have two or three years of imprisonment, while I will have twenty years of imprisonment."</p>

<h3>Flattery</h3>
<p>— Yang Mou</p>
<p>When you are sitting there getting your shoes shined, and the shoe shiner compliments how good the style of your shoes are or how sophisticated they are, even if your shoes are already broken or old, he seems to reopen the brilliant history of the past for you, and you often can't help but smile.</p>
<p>As a human being, one always likes people's flattery to a greater or lesser extent. The degree inevitably depends on personality, and likes and dislikes also vary with personality.</p>
<p>I remember such a fact that one person refused all praise and flattery, but when someone complimented him as the person in the world who loved flattery the least, he would also nod and smile.</p>
<p>Everyone has their own position and attitude towards life, and they all vary from person to person and from place to place. But, in a word, who can jump out of its circle?</p>
<p>However, whether flattering others or being flattered by others, one should always have appropriate consideration between the acceptable and the flattering, otherwise, one will definitely be ridiculed.</p>

<h3>Sent to My Deceased Wife Fengjun (2)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>I didn't spend this Lunar New Year well. On the one hand, I was busy checking things and preparing for the move to Suzhou; on the other hand, I was secretly worried about your illness. Occasionally when I went out and met relatives and friends, I always used this as a topic of conversation, hoping to gain their sympathy and comfort, and their views were exactly the same as those of Dr. Cheng. Therefore, my heart was a little relieved. I fully believed that when I returned to Suzhou, you would be able to slowly get rid of the clutches of the disease. However, our hometown has a quiet environment, lush flowers and trees, and plenty of air and sunshine. It is a natural sanatorium. If you go back to recuperate for one or two months, actively treat with injections and medicine, even if the disease is fierce, you must know that it is difficult to retreat; you are also very optimistic, just waiting to spend the Lantern Festival, you can see the gentle mountains and soft water of Suzhou again.</p>
<p>After all the furniture was loaded onto the ship, we set off on the 18th morning. Zheng'er and his young couple and Bao Mei and her son were all scheduled to accompany us to Suzhou; my old friend Major General Liu Hanjun knew about it and first sent someone to the train to reserve a few first-class seats, and then sent a captain to pick us up in a jeep. Such kindness really made me very grateful! The weather was not cold that day, but there was some wind. Even though you were wearing a thick camel hair coat, I was still afraid you couldn't stand it. I wrapped a scarf around your mouth, nose, and neck, and wrapped a large handkerchief around your head. Along the way, I asked you if you were cold or uncomfortable? You always smiled and said you weren't cold, you were very comfortable, putting my mind at ease. When getting on the train, the daughter-in-law helped you walk a long way, you walked very fast, and you didn't pant; sitting opposite me in the car, you were always talking and laughing, very happy. When we got off the train at Suzhou Station, the daughter-in-law still helped you walk a long way before we left the station. Then we took a rickety rickshaw for twenty minutes to reach home. Your thin face still had a smile on it, saying that you didn't feel tired; I knew that you were so happy and forgetful because you were seeing your hometown after eight years of separation.</p>
<p>The next day, I was busy visiting a few medical friends and showing them the X-ray photos. They all said that the situation was not serious and that calcium and vitamin BC should be injected. So, the retired Dr. Pang introduced a young Dr. Wu next door to me, who came to inject it every other day. The calcium and vitamin C were injected into the muscle. At that time, your fever rose and fell every day. When it was high, it was two degrees higher than normal, and when it was low, it was one degree higher than normal. There was never a time when it was completely gone. At first, I didn't hide it from you, which made you very anxious, but I couldn't comfort you. After more than half a month, my old friend Cheng Xiaoqing and his brother returned to Suzhou. Hearing that your fever had not subsided, he suggested that you should get air injections. His wife and his cousin Yude, who had suffered from lung disease and was still recuperating, also thought that air injections were necessary. It was useless to inject only calcium and other three kinds of medicines. Now that things have come to this point, there is no room for delay. I was very grateful for my old friend's enthusiasm, so I asked him to book a first-class ward for you in Boxi Hospital. The next day, the person in charge of the hospital sent a stretcher to carry you away. I stayed at home to keep guard, and Grandma Ye, who had been working in my house for more than twenty years, took care of the housework, so that Bao Mei could accompany you in the hospital to avoid loneliness. Two days later, Dr. Huang gave you an air injection on your right lung. I watched trembling beside you. Your face turned very ugly. It seemed that your chest was very stuffy. After the doctor left, you still said: "It's extremely stuffy, extremely stuffy, how can I not breathe?" I panicked and went to ask the doctor. He said that this was a phenomenon that should occur after the injection, and it would be nothing in a while. After more than ten minutes, it gradually recovered. At that time, I was very optimistic, because I had heard Yude say that if the air injection could be given, then as long as it was given, the lungs could be killed, and the bacteria would have no way to move; I comforted you with these words, and we both had joy. While you were staying in the hospital, I always came to visit you every morning. A long blue and white patterned vase was placed on the side of your sickbed. When there were any flowers in the garden, I would pick them for you to enjoy, from green plums to white magnolias, each flower seemed to be smiling at you. In a blink of an eye, half a month had passed. Air injections were given every three days, and the left and right lungs had been injected twice each, and calcium and other three kinds of medicines were still injected every other day, plus bihekoling was also injected four times, and medicine from the hospital was taken, always three or four times a day. But I don't know why, your fever still rose and fell, and there was not much progress. I had to ask the nurses to lie to you and tell you that the fever had completely subsided. Feng, you must understand my suffering, my deceiving you is all to make you feel at ease!</p>
