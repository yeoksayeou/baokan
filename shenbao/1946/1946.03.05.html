<h3>俞鴻鈞出席二中全會　闡述八項財政措施　今後將步入平時狀態</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶四日電〕二中全會四日上午舉行第三次大會，財政部長俞鴻鈞作財政金融問題報告，略稱：今天對大會報告財政金融問題，所有九個月來財政部工作詳細情形，已經另具書面報告，呈由行政院彙編分發，現在僅擇其中最重要，而爲各位所最關心之數項，提出簡單的報告。本報告分爲以下八項：（一）當前財政中心政策，（二）租稅制度改進問題，（三）變更物資管制問題，（四）金融管制問題，（五）穩定幣値問題，（六）充裕地方財政問題，（七）平衡國庫收支同題，（八）整　稅務人員風紀問題。</p>
<p>當前財政中心政策</p>
<p>一，當前財政中心政策　本會議之舉行，距一中全會之期約九閱月，在過去九個月當中，國內外情况都有重大的變化，政府一切政策當然也要隨着而有種種新決定與新揹施。今日之財政，是由支持戰爭的戰時財政，走向復興建設的平時財政之過渡狀態，就是以復員爲中心的財政政策。本部過去數月所實施，並爲今後計劃所循依的方針，是　改進租稅制度，以平均人民財富之分配，幷促進國內產業之發達，2劃撥省縣稅收，充裕地方財政，以期推進經濟建設，完成自治。3以國際合作，穩定匯價以黃金外匯物資穩定幣値，因而减少法幣發行，導金融於生產途徑，並促進狄國之國際貿易，4利用敵僞產業與國際剩餘之經濟力量，以補充國家之財力，進謀國庫收支之平衡。凡此種種，都是根據本黨主義　　全大會所次誠本黨政綱政策之各項原則抽繳歸納而得來的。以下所報告的各項問題，就是本部依照這幾條原則而推行的。</p>
<p>租稅制度改進問題</p>
<p>二，租稅制度改進問題　勝利以後，國家財政應漸由戰時轉入平時，我國現行租稅制度，多已從新檢討，加以改進，期能適應今後建國的需要。改進之目標，舉其要者有三：第一，力求稅制的簡單化，第二，配合今後的經濟建設，第三，運用稅制，以改善社會財富的分配。勝利後改進稅制，在直接稅方面，已採用各種生活必需費的减免規定，同時對各新的累進稅率又酌予提高。一方面實行有錢出錢的原則，一方面復减免貧苦者的負擔。我國稅制經此改進以後，似以時日，生產事業發達，即可以直接稅爲主幹，各種貨物稅備之，完成一種健全的稅制體系。</p>
<p>變更物資管制問題</p>
<p>三，變更物資管制問題　勝利以前我政府先後管制之物資品類甚　，屬於本部所主管者，如花紗布之管制，食鹽之專賣，麥粉·糖類統稅物品之征實及桐油。猪鬃。羊毛。茶葉·生絲等統購統銷都是，現在全已變更過去辦法，一方面可以暢通貨運，便利商民，另一方面也可藉資促進生產，增加稅收。現在花紗布的管制已經取銷，食鹽的管制亦已廢止，統稅征實部分　又已回征稅款。關於進出口物資原屬純內戰時需要而管制者，已分別予以修改或廢止，（一）廢止物資進出封鎖議禁運及檢查之規定，（二）取銷桐油·猪鬃。羊毛·茶葉·生絲等統購統銷辦法　（三）簡化管制物資之品目，戰時主管此項業務之貿易委會及其附屬之三公司，亦已先後裁撤，最近並公布實施進出口貿易暫行辦法。</p>
<p>關於金融管制問題</p>
<p>四，金融管制問題，抗戰勝利，金融政策方面，首在健全銀行制度，使各種銀行得依法營業，本部現已草成九種法規，業經呈奉政院會議通過，送請完成立法程序，不久當可付之施行，今後各種銀行經營皆有途轍可尋，而銀行制度亦賴以健全。次爲管理銀行業務，現在抗戰勝利，管理銀行法令，自應酌予放寬，使金融發展力量，以培養經濟，惟在此復興建設時期，銀行資金運用，當以扶助生產事業爲主要，本部自應督促繼續辦理，以期健全銀行會計制度，推行票據制度，以健全信用工具，平抑市塲利率，發展經濟，均經訂有辦法，可資遵循，今後如交通恢復正常，工廠逐漸復工，國際路綫暢通，俾管理銀行業務得以配合進行，則本部對於金融之管制，當可表現相十當成效。</p>
<p>穩定幣値充裕財政</p>
<p>五，穩定幣値問題　第一是開放外匯市塲，第二爲整理敵僞鈔劵，第三爲一處理台灣及東北鈔劵。至於中央銀行管理外匯暫行辦法之要點，可槪括爲三：（一）廢止官價，（二）中行得隨時供給或收買外匯，藉以穩定外匯市塲，黃金亦得同樣辦理，（三）所有外匯存款，不得增加，各存戶至遲應於本年九月底，將存款餘額依照當日市價售予中央銀行。</p>
<p>六，充裕地方財政問題　財政部依據本黨政策，隨時注意自治財政之改進，勝利以後，爲謀財政復員，業已擬有計劃，經過財政專門委會之研議，現正　請國防會核示中。</p>
<p>七，平衡國庫收支問題　本年度抗戰已經結東，在財政復員計劃中，平衡國庫收支，自屬先決條件，因本下列方針，進行　製預算，在收入方面：（一）以恢復戰前收入爲目標，（二）確實佔計稅率稅額與物價之關係，（三）擴大一切可能收入之範圍。在支出方面：（一）儘可能求得軍費比例之合理，（二）切實配合善後救濟計劃，（三）緊縮不必要之支出。</p>
<p>整飭稅務人員風紀</p>
<p>八，整飭稅務人員風紀問題　本部在過去一年間，先後裁撤附屬機關共六一〇單位，各級人員共一八〇，八六人，目的在調整業務，簡化機構，亦即健全人事，樹立制度之初步準備，現正通盤檢討。今後用人方針，擬從考試入手，以杜　營，從　考核，以正風氣，優定待遇，以攬賢良，加强保障，以勵永業。在消極方面，本部對於貪汚案件之舉　發，素所鼓勵，凡檢舉案件，無論匿名。具名，一律受理，其經查有不法情事或貪汚屬實者，一律從嚴辦理，不稍姑息，以資警惕。結論，以上是本部對常前財政金融幾個重要問題的措施槪况，謹切實檢討，簡明報告於大會諸同志之前。</p>

<h3>財政經濟金融報告　今晨將繼續檢討　昨各委發言多主增加生產</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶四日電〕二中全</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶四日電〕二中全會三次大會，於四日下午三時廿分繼續舉行，由白委員崇禧主席，翁文灝作經濟報告，歷時一小時二十分始畢。休息後，五時繼續開會，主席宣告檢討財政經濟金融之報告，首由陳希豪發言，渠指出新疆幣制迄未整理，至使物價日高，邊疆工作同志幾無以爲生，希望從速整理新幣及提高邊疆工作同志之待遇。楊繼曾以爲，依照幣制比例，則現在國家預算不能謂爲過大，政府應有辦法可以控制預算，使收支平衡。潘公展謂，財政經濟，如經濟生產事業無辦法，則財政收支之平衡爲不可能，　舉上海一帶工廠至今尚在停頓中，接收物資究有若干，亦無確數，據經濟部認爲，接收最令人滿意之上海區，尚且如此，則他處可想而知。因工廠停頓，游資無正當出路，遂羣趨於投機之途，而政府對於黃金及外匯價格，又久不決定，予投機者以可乘之隙，數月來由於黃金，美鈔價格波動之刺激，物價普遍高漲，以上海爲例，去年十月間至今年二月，物價指數竟高漲四倍，今後全國各界應協助監督財政富局，緊縮通貨，一面收回人民手中之大量通貨。渠並代表東南各省人民呼籲當局應繼續收兌僞幣。宋宜山提出節流開源及獎勵儲蓄，使法幣回籠這意見。程中行强調地方財政之極端困難，以爲地方有辦法，中央始有辦法，自從豁免田賦之後，地方政府已陷於紊亂不堪之窘境，渠又提出京·滬沿綫各縣之私人銀行·錢莊均陷停頓，應速謀整理及各地動力亟應恢復，以增加地方生產。關於各省區敵僞產業之處理，僅由地方人士參與其事，而中央監察機關無從過問，渠認爲係違反五權，忽視監察權力，而表示抗議。鄧飛黃以爲，財政之困難，金融之紊亂，可以兩例說明，一即黃金政策之失信於民，二即僞幣法幣二百比一之不合。渠並質問，在美國凍結之資金，何以迄未提用，國難財及投機非份之收入，何以不能調查，課以重稅，檢討至此，已下午六時，主席宣告散會。秘書處報告，五日上午大會繼續檢討財政金融經濟並報告外交。</p>
<h3>東蒙要求自治行營已予拒絕</h3>
<p>〔聯合社北平四日電〕東蒙代表四人，由蒙古人民議會派來提出獨立要求，代表之一桑克嘉布氏昨在此間私人談話中披露，彼等欲向中央政府請求自治，已遭東北行營拒絕。桑氏稱，三十五年來蒙古欲獲自治，現已第四次，彼等並無任何黨派或外國勢力爲後盾。蒙古人民力量不足，不欲成立共和國。彼等要求自治之區域，自長春迤北一百五十公里起至外蒙邊界止，東迄呼倫，西止平泉，人口約一百七十萬。蒙古人民均明瞭目前國際關係，錯縱複雜，要求自治，尚非其時，故願先俟中國獲得和平與安全，惟中央政府如果不允自治，則蒙古人民將起而爭鬥。蒙古人民議會議員五百五十三人，工農佔百分之六十，小工業商人百分之十，軍人百分之十二，官史百分之八，其餘百分之十爲地主，　嘛及婦女等均係十一月一日選出。蒙古人民堅決反對中央政府，共產黨，或蘇方之壓迫，無論何方企圖干涉，蒙古人民均將反抗之</p>
<h3>東北大批日俘　已被運往蘇聯</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約三日電〕據哥倫比亞廣播公司駐瀋陽通訊員摩拉　報告稱：東北蘇軍司令史丹凱維區，於昨日招待新聞記者時告美國記者稱：大批日本俘虜，五十萬至一百萬人已運往蘇聯。又據稱，史氏曾謂：「關於美國遣送東北日僑回國這計劃，渠絕無所知。」</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三日電〕華盛頓明星晚報今日載社論稱：在蘇聯搬運東北工業設備之問題未臻明朋化以前，美國之顧慮與猜疑不能消除。蘇聯未經通知美國，中國及其他聯合國國家，而遽採取此項行動，顯係投機取巧之行爲。蘇聯對於東北設備縱有分嘗一臠之權，但次無於此時搬取任何物件之理由，此一問題，「顯然」應由聯合國合組之賠價委員會處理之。</p>
<h3>京日俘五千　疏濬秦淮河</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京四日電〕日軍俘虜五千人，現已飭令担任秦淮河濬河工作。最後一批日僑二千零三十八人，今日赴滬，以備遣送回國。現留此間日僑，僅有六百人，分派各機關工作。</p>
<h3>張周馬飛歸綏延安　三氏定今日赴武漢視察</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口四日電〕軍事三人小組張治中·周恩來·馬歇爾等，定明午飛漢視察，其先遣人員今日可到達此間，各界正準備盛大歡迎。又共黨中原軍區司令朱先念。參謀長鄭位三。政治委員陳首道等，昨自宣化店抵漢，定今日訪郭總司令。據朱氏談稱，此行任務係向張周馬三氏，報告華中區軍事調處情形。</p>
<p>〔中央社太原四日電〕張周馬一行卅五人，今晨九時廿分分乘兩巨機，由此起飛赴歸綏，開始其第四日之視察旅程，在綏垣稍作停留，即將於下午轉赴延安，此間黨政軍團各首長曁執行小組三代表，均赴機塲歡送。</p>
<p>魯省　處雷克功績</p>
<p>〔聯合社濟南三日電〕軍事調處執行部濟南小組美國代表雷克上校，體力健碩，向有幹練稱譽，數星期來在此間一帶進行軍事調處，曾在被共軍園困之三城市中，救出數萬軍民。馬歇爾等三人委員會方於今日蒞臨濟南實地考察調處情形，雷克上校亦前往報告。其左右爲記者道其工作經過如次：當時雷克發現兗州，聊城及泰安均遭共軍圍攻，城內守軍係僞軍改編之中央軍，因共軍厲行封鎖，城內斷糧，軍民俱奄奄待斃。雷克得小組內中央及中共代表全力支持，即採取嚴岐行動，下令以專車裝載糧食，親自押送，開入共軍陣綫。某次一中央任命之縣長，偷過封鎖綫，向雷克籲請發給食糧，歸途被煽動者所圍攻，聲言其戰時曾與敵僞政府有關，須將其絞次。據目擊者稱，雷克即挺身而出，告衆人曰，「汝等不能將其絞次，汝等儘可將予絞次，但事情並不能因此解次。」衆人却退，於是食糧，縣長，及雷克均獲通過封鎖綫入城。雷克調處之成功，一以其胆勇，一以其不折不撓，任何問題必力謀解次始已，故信孚雙方。大約此即所以雷克今日能向馬歇爾提出如是報告：「在此區域內，局勢平靖，被圍各城人民均獲糧食接濟，目前似已無困難。」</p>

<p>打中正路上溜溜，盡是茶葉，雨傘，　，漆器，水菓鋪子。人像潮湧，沒有汽車，有的是叮零作叮鈴作響載著尖箬捷走的狹小的黃包車，三輪車夫，偶面有一輛吉普卡，却惹起人們莫大的注意。小巷，大街，同樣的特徵是很整潔，縱使在正午熱流沖激時，滿飄著灰沙。人們可以作為娛樂的是，土著的閩戲，被上海人遺忘的前十年的影片。有兩家跳舞場，皇后和國際，皇后是用留聲機伴奏的，國際只是三五個從上海大世界來的吹打手，奏著脫了接拍的靡靡之音，舞女是土著的姑娘，妓女，私娼，土　交際花，打扮得花枝招展的跳著牛步舞，抱着從上海香港去過　的舞客底腰，用最單純的閩式官話迷惑找尋刺激的公務人員和旅客。茶錢三百元，只有清茶，沒有其他。這裏不是舞場，是公開的人肉市場。</p>
<p>物價扶搖直上　何時平貴回窰</p>
<p>驚人飛漲的物價，把卅一萬人民生活從平淡變了緊張，同時也助長了消費面的擴大。市面上流行著到台灣，上海去發洋財的暴發戶的逸話，他們以投機取巧操縱居奇而成鉅富。即以最近幾天的米價而論，從七八千元一石暴漲到一萬五千元，緊跟著米糧，其他日用品也統在上漲。政府一面舉辦平　，一面請求五萬二千石賦糙，加速啟運來榕。這個嚴重問題，急煞了　鎭水上將，連日邀集士紳商賈，籌組救濟民生協會，更由警局將米奸林渭藩等遊街示眾。在十五日的粹報上有這樣刺激性的標題：「福州米價達一萬五千元，省政首長聽到了沒有？平糶望眼欲穿，何時「平貴回窰？」省府發言人公開表示，要抑平到一萬元一石，各報一致要求「兌現」！食米之外的茶葉，聞名的福建香片，前十天還是十萬一担，如今却漲到四十萬左右，尚告缺貨。一般的食品店，却較滬低廉。</p>
<p>女學生穿裙子　男學生着制服</p>
<p>淫面的看，榕市的學校相富多，但一般的教育水準實在太差。我們參觀過幾個國民小學，學生科卷上改錯的字太多。青年會的中學裏，初中一不考英文。街頭酒坊和店鋪鎖帖的條子，不通的居多，即是在旅館裏，官方衛生事務所的通告，內有「本所人員，無多耳目，難周檢查，容有疏忽…」這種文法，却很少見。不過女學生着裙，男學生穿制服，且都能說普通話，這現象是挺給人滿意的。</p>
<p>報界病態百出　認自由為虐政</p>
<p>教育水准的低落，物價的高漲，影響了治安的困難，也影響了文化出版界的活躍。從上海來的報章雜誌，都相隔半個或一個月，讀者購買力薄弱得很。福州現有中央日報，正義日報，民主報，閩海日報，南方日報，粹報等六家，都是用土紙印的，十六日起聯合漲價，維持血本。實際上的銷數都很慘，而報導又是共同的。熟悉新聞界內幕的人，嚴厲的指出，福州新聞界的病態：他們不切望於檢查制度的廢除，如此反而增加了報社和編者的重負。對於政府所給予的新聞自由，言論自由，實在是精神和業務上的虐政！</p>
<p>赴台船隻不夠　渡海難於登天</p>
<p>福建的天時地理，都承受台灣的影響，兩省之間，雖隔着惡性的峻險的海峽，事實上却保持密切的聯繫。尤其是在交通工具缺乏的目前，福州更成為台灣的後方供應站。人們都從這裏到對省去，經商從政，用帆船或是燒柴油重一百噸左右的棚棚船。有許多商人，在台灣省台幣未折合法幣和未統制出口之前，發了大財，主要的交易，是糖，香蕉等。現在有幾條船，經常開台省的，但是他們願意載貨，不願意載客，因為一噸貨物的運費，已由三萬漲到十二萬，而客票祗是從六千漲到一萬二。所以截至目前為止，躭在福州的赴台工作人員，有千餘人，統是困居逆旅，無法渡海。報紙上有福州至台北的航綫，據說義嶼機場的滑道壞了，要修築，須費時二月或三月。這使到台北的交通綫更減少了。</p>
<p>花樣的海濱都市—福州，經過敵偽的兩度摧殘，除了　前山上還留有一點殘跡外，已經找不到其他的蹄痕。著都市正像絕麗的奇葩，只要社會環境興風尚，　從複雜整理到單純，切實的建設，配合着自然的環境，灌溉着三月的春水，這花朶次不会凋殘的。</p>
<p>古老的南中國都市的情調，够使人們　引起　長得記憶和懷念！</p>
<h3>海南島的現代建築物</h3>
<p>孤懸海外的海南島，設備充實，跟台灣一樣象徵着中國之一對眼睛。收復以來，加上整理與利用，將如畫龍點睛，美不勝收。最近派赴海南為省主席辦公處主任的蔡勁軍氏說：「海南島今日正象徵着ー個容貌端正的村姑，薄施鉛華，便楚楚可人」。—眞的，讓這個村姑快快打扮一下罷！</p>
<h3>共黨代表在徐州作客</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　姜軍寄</p>
<p>三民主義青年團銅山分團部，最近居住着一羣「怪客」——調處第四小組的中共代表及其隨從人員。所謂「怪客」者，因為那些客人在過去是三民主義的政敵，是共產主義的信徒們。</p>
<p>爲了好奇心的驅使，爲了這一羣陌生的面孔，關係我國軍政統一和民族復興的前途，人們經過它的門前，都不免要扭轉頭來，向它投擲一個飛眼。</p>
<p>這是一幢新式的建築，靜靜地站在啟明路旁，自從它變成中共代表羣的招待所以來，戶外添了兩名戒備保護的憲兵，當記者前往訪問的時候，我仿佛感觸到這一座屋子添上了幾分「莊嚴」。</p>
<p>經過一番嚴密的盤詢，憲兵同志帶我會見徐州綏靖公署的聯絡副官，我說明了來意，約摸五分鐘的時間，傳令兵領我前去。二道內門和樓梯入口，各有一名憲兵崗位，待到登上最高一層樓，傳令兵折返，另由中共士兵「引渡」。這時，我發現：樓上和樓下之隔，正好比目前的軍事局勢一樣，樓上完全是重工的世界，衛兵都是藍色邊圈，白底藍字的「新四軍」背章。我心裏案子忖度：「我已進入共軍區域了」。</p>
<p>「您進來的手續很方便嗎」？不待我開口，中共代表王世英劈頭向我發出這一個疑問。</p>
<p>「很方便」。我忠實的答覆他</p>
<p>於是，他向我解釋：過去新聞記者去訪問他，必須經過多次的交涉，而且，要佩戴着「綏署」的符號。他附帶告訴我：我是第五個會見他的記者。</p>
<p>副參謀長王世英</p>
<p>王世英中等身材，體格魁偉，是一個典型的北方人。山西口音，說起話來，時常露出上牙床鑲有的兩枚金牙。外表好像是個木匠，又好像是個廚司，可是，待人態度，粗中有細，不斷會說些新名詞。他身穿一　新製的呢貭改良式的軍服，少將領章。他的名片是：「國民革命軍第十八集團軍副參謀長」</p>
<p>王世英副參謀長說：「徐州調處小組的工作範圍，包括徐州綏靖公署所轄的整個區域。截至目前止，調處工作，尚無具體進展」。</p>
<p>「中共控制區域，在徐州調處小組範圍以內者，計有「華中軍區」，（蘇北一帶）「山東軍區「和「冀魯軍區」的一部。（以山東省內金浦鐵路為界，路綫以東為「山東軍區」，路綫迤西爲「冀魯軍區」）各該區域有「新四軍」，也有「八路軍」。</p>
<p>雙方後撤六十里</p>
<p>「關於軍事調處執行部限令雙方軍隊後撤六十里，中共認為此項規定，對國軍有利，礙難遵辦」。</p>
<p>記者提出：中共要求國軍撤出臨城棗莊，是否有碍津浦鐵路的恢復？是否有碍調處工作的進行？他說：「在中共軍隊控制的廣大區域內，臨城和棗莊位居中心的一點，中共認為威脅太大，必須要求國軍撤退。」</p>
<p>「雙方如能互相讓步，調處工作，終必可以完成。」這是他最後對記者「聊以解嘲」的說明。</p>
<p>這一天，王世英爲了招待記者，特地飭人買了一包「吉士」香烟。</p>
<p>正式代表韋國清</p>
<p>王世英是徐州調處小組中，方面的共時代表臨早幾天他已飛赴北平，正式代表韋國清，是「新四軍」第二師代師長。此人棉布灰軍服，布鞋，衣着樸素，不苟言笑，談吐深沈，共產黨的氣味似乎較濃厚。多少還帶有「廣西人」的家鄉味兒。當記者和韋國清交談的時候，旁座一位年輕小伙子，手持筆記本，用極快的速度，把我們的談話，記錄存查，據說：他是「新四軍」政治部的工作人員，這位共產主義的政工同志，待人說話，更和藹，更親切，我是一個隨便慣了的人，當我被處於如此狀態之下，彷彿有點「那個」。</p>
<p>綏署招待膳食好</p>
<p>中共代表及其隨從人員，凡二十餘人，他們在徐州的生活，由徐州綏靖公署負責招待，每日菜蔬，四菜一湯，白麵饅頭和大米飯，伙食很好。飯後消遣是做乒乓球運動，生活興趣相當濃厚。外出的交通工具，政府還為他們特備汽車一輛。「新四軍」和「八路軍」背章的中共士兵，服裝和國軍差不多，有草綠包，也有灰色，惟上裝較長，下垂及膝，代表及隨員全部是嶄新的，顯然是爲了「作客」而特備的。這些中共士兵，似乎都是受過嚴格訓練的智識份子，待人接物，謙恭有禮。他們和「中央憲兵」之間，相處和睦，如果從這一點可以象徵整個國共關繫的未來，我們可以斷言：中國一定有辦法。</p>
<h3>祖國巨眼孤懸海外　海南島，躍進罷！</h3>
<p>— 本報航訊　慕生寄自三亞灣</p>
<p>與台灣並稱為「中國之兩巨眼」的海南島，自去年十月十七日由四十六軍韓軍長錬成率領所部一八八師與新十九師分頭接收以來，一切均在順利進展中，迄現在止，各區都跟隨着祖國的光榮勝利而陸續收復了。如果這裏眞是所謂「世外桃源」的話，那末，現在正是要使這兒「桃源化」的時候，而記者之所謂「桃源化」，意思就是在廢墟中建設與復興工作之具體化。今就記者一週調查所得，把各種固有的設備及其現狀，作一次綜合報導，諒亦為本報讀者所樂聞歟？</p>
<p>在我方接收大員尚未到達海南島以前，據悉頑惡的日人會將大量軍械，物資，秘密運往海岸各口，沈没在那裏，並將許多布匹付諸敵熖，這些都是大可痛惜的，不知道我當局是否將日方的闖禍者以相當的處分，否則似未免太便宜了敵人了吧？</p>
<p>民眾耐苦　富進取心</p>
<p>此間人民生活雖苦，但其刻苦耐勞，活潑而富於進取的精神，却不是祖國其他地區所可望其項背。只要政治能迅速的踏上軌道，各種企業能陸續恢複生產，則不難成為祖國的一個最豐饒的部分，而這對於祖國的前途也將發出更燦爛的光彩。在農林方面，自然林遍地皆是，良材取之不盡。未開墾的荒地，比已開墾的的還多。天氣溫和，冬季亦和暖如春。此間(三亞灣)向有「常夏之區」的稱呼，這是臨近赤道，天氣較熱的原故。冬天的椰林風光，往往呈現着一片春色或秋色。假若水利開發，每年可耕種三次，糧食將有剩餘，以補粵省各地的不足。選種，施肥等問題，三亞試驗場，已有成績，倘若繼續這未竟的工作，這些問題當不難解決。</p>
<p>工廠設備　尚稱完好</p>
<p>可喜的是現成物資和日用品工業，（如醬油及皮革等）接收最早，並已予以利用，開工生產。工礦設備尚稱完好，可望不久着手開工。可是重工業及由三亞到北黎的一段鐵路，以及海口的一個特殊設備麻瘋病院，則迄今猶未見接收。工人陷於失業，陷於凍餒者，不在少數，倘不施行緊急救濟，不僅這些工人將陷於絕境，即使當地治安秩序恐怕也將成為嚴重的問題，據說我主管當局對此已密切注意到，並且在加以縝密考慮對策了。</p>
<p>目前的海南島，還滯留在青黃不接的苦悶的門檻上。社會上呈現着一般的混淆，工商界也都表現着停頓的狀態。商民們因現狀混亂，紛紛蠢動，其最惡劣者，則認此為渾水摸魚之好機會，不惜造作種種名目，與地方特殊勢力相勾結，實行其巧取豪奪的手腕，使必要的商品也無法通行，馴至正常的營業就沒有其立足或發展的餘地。我政府當局雖已明令免徵各收復區田賦一年，但此間仍有利用某種名義徵收糧食的怪現象。今日海南民眾，在受盡了敵偽方面七年來窮兇極惡的榨取博學之餘，竟還要再受這種可免而未免的摧殘呢？</p>
<p>工礦方面，則海南島得天獨厚，雖因缺乏煤，而且河流短小，不能建大規模水力發電廠，以供應動力，頗難成為一獨立的工業單位，然而擁有極優良的鐵礦。可惜我國目前尚沒有這麼大規模的鐵工廠，以消費年產三百萬噸的鐵砂，兩年內很難有復工的希望。但這重要的資源，是早晚會成為建設新中國的寶庫的。</p>
<p>海南島今後必要予以利用的事業很多，其中主要的可分為軍用事業，礦業，造船業，水路運輸業，電氣業，化學工業等部門。在軍事上，最重要的設備，有最完善的空軍基地三所，有規模巨大的海軍醫院，有細菌研究室，有養氣製造廠，有長達一百八十公里的輕軌鐵道（由榆林通到北黎）。</p>
<p>開發資源　貢獻特多</p>
<p>礦藏是海南島的重要資源，儲藏量極豐，礦質也極優良，最主要者爲鐵，過去日方所經營者計有田獨鐵礦與石碌鐵礦兩個，其設備大都完好如昔，可立即予以利用。</p>
<p>最後，記者希望當局能積極利用當日敵人所遺下的軍事設施，加以改善或調整，達到鞏固祖國海陸軍基地任務的目的，因此，在目前，誰也不應該斤斤計較着什麽私利和小利，而辜負了全島三百萬民顒顒望治的熱烈心腸。起來龍！為國防，為民生，迅速確立一個萬世不滅的基礎！（元月十五日）</p>
<h3>讀者意見　平抑物價一得之見</h3>
<p>主筆先生：近日黃金政策有無改善，人民尚不得知；而事實上則實未見作何有效措施。又如久已傳聞之孫票，亦是刺激物價和法幣價値之利器。現在大家爭購赤金物資，而不敢收存法幣過夜。如政府欲解決窮苦人民隱痛，維持社會秩序，則急應採納下列諸措施：</p>
<p>（一）首先要將經濟政策與將來幣制改革之辦法確實宣佈，如含有與民爭利，和足以刺激物價之因素，應即改除；尤其要使人民對政府保障法幣有相當信仰。</p>
<p>（二）當局應向人民公佈孫票事實和與法幣比値，如果孫票發行確將影響法幣價値，或政府根本無此計劃，則應請當局作詳盡聲明</p>
<p>（三）政府應即將大量黃金照較廉之官價儘量拋出。按照各地情形，立定平抑物價之法案，即刻宣佈。如再有奸商或敗類居奇操縱者，執法以綱，能如此則物價自然跌落。葉錫珪（二月廿六日）</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>弗朗哥政權的摧毀</h3>
<p>聯合國成立以來，對西班牙弗朗哥政權，曾不斷施予壓力，認為西班牙政局必須澈底改組，實現民選政府，然後西班牙始能重新參加國際政治。最近法西關係突緊，法政府下令封鎖法西兩國邊界，認為西班牙現局足以「危害國際安全」，要求推翻弗朗哥政權。法西邊境於是劍拔弩張，同時列強對弗朗哥政權所加之壓力亦提高。人國政府於接獲法國政府請求與弗朗哥政權斷絕關係后，會照會英法兩國，所提內容，雖未經發表：然據外交方面宣稱：　國殆係提議由美英法三國政府聲明不贊成弗朗哥，並對弗朗哥政府之繼續存在，表示不滿。英美法三國同時并擬發表聯合聲明，要求結束弗朗哥政　。弗朗哥政權　　　　形勢下如何應付，以及西班牙人民對英法美諸國所加予弗朗哥的壓力而引起的反動如何，雖尚有待於此後事熊發展的證明，我們對於西班牙局勢的發展，似也不能不有一言，因為這裏面包含有國際關係上一個極重要的原則，這種原則在此後國際關係上的遭遇如何，不特關係各民族的獨立生存，抑且有關世界的安危。</p>
<p>我們要首先申明的就是我們對於弗朗哥政權不但沒有好感，而且還有相當敵意。弗朗哥政權對於軸心國家的奉承，因而承認出現在中國的傀儡政權；這在中國人民心中將永不會寬恕的事。就國家的立場來說，我們不但同情而且贊成英美法諸國對弗朗哥政權所取的態度與措施。但若使我們從另一個角度來看列強對弗朗哥政權的措施，我們很担憂在國際關係上一個很重要的原則，將被拋棄。這原則是什麽？這就是內政的不干涉。曾記得大西洋憲章有不干涉內政的諾言，今列強所加予弗朗哥證券的壓力，究其實際，實無異干涉內政。弗朗哥政權是目今西班牙惟一的安定政權，無論從道義及法理上講，列強似不能以國際壓力加諸此在西班牙爲唯一的安定政權，使之崩潰。民主運動必須是內發的，弗朗哥政權的推翻，必須由西班牙人民自發的起而爲之，若一政權因不容于列強，而由列強加以壓力迫之摧毀，此一原則，若被承認，則各民族將不複有獨立自主的生存；此在將來的國際關係上，將是一個危險的先例。</p>
<p>倫敦日矅泰晤士報近爲維護不干涉內政原則曾著論對西班牙局勢有所指陳，其言曰：「在英國的戰時及目前很少有人會擁護弗朗哥所取的政策，但他的行爲却不能認爲足以「危害國際安全」實際上西班牙在目前孤立的形勢下對於任何人都不能成爲威脅。在此情形之下，對弗朗哥聯合行動的要求無寗說是在從聯合國當前許多嚴重難決的問題中移轉世人的注意，此項移轉實亦無其必要。西班牙的人民對外國的干涉他們內政將引起不滿，此正足以使西班牙人民從攻擊弗朗哥反而予以支持。此項干涉內政的結果將無止境，英國在採取行動以前必須審慎考慮，因此項行動可能使不干涉原則及對於法律的尊嚴遭到損害，而爲維護這些原則是使英國加入一九三九年的戰爭，即在今日，英國又欲在東歐見其有效，雖其成功，未必一致。」在舉世滔滔的今日，倫敦日躍泰晤士報能特別提出不干涉原則及法律尊嚴的不可傷害此在泰晤士報，固原有用意，但與我們所見，可謂巧合。</p>
<p>總之，我們對於弗朗哥政權沒有愛戀，就國家的立場，我們願見其早日崩潰；但如以國際壓力迫使其崩潰，終覺損害了不干涉內政的原則及法律的尊嚴．如果將來的國際關係要築在法制的基礎上，是對於法律尊嚴的損害，將爲足以遺憾的先例。</p>

<h3>同業操縱配售日用品不均　違反平抑物價原意　烟兌店三百數十家請澈查</h3>
<p>〔本　專訊〕本　　兌　　　　　　　　，　　　　　等三百五十一　，　　　　　處理局發售之平價肥皂等日用品，被少數人操縱，大部份同業皆不能派到，故昨日下午三時推派代表數十人，赴市政府求見錢市長，並聯名呈請澈查。據代表稱，本市烟兌業共約一萬家，而處理局歷次發售之平價貨品，如肥皂·火柴等，皆由七百多家與公會有特殊關係之烟兌店分後，於黑市中出售，多數同業咸不能染指，殊有遠反抑平物價原意。又謂處理局發售平價皂已五次，共約四十餘萬箱，第一次發售之平價皂，官價每箱爲九千五百元，而黑市即售一萬八千元，最近之第五次，官價二萬元，黑市二萬八千元，因平價貨被少數同業操縱，流入黑市，故市民未能受惠云。同時訊者又訪該業公會負責人，據稱，本會同業僅四千餘家，依營業範圍之大小，分甲。乙·丙·了四等，甲乙等皆已有平價貨派到，丙·丁等店因爲數較多，且不能迅速籌款，處理局恐發售手續過於麻煩，故未派購，公會現正呈文申請中，至於平價物以黑市出售，甚願同業相互督促檢舉云。</p>

<h3>外匯實施開放　市塲反應良好　實施開放</h3>
<p>昨日宣布對美電匯二〇二〇元　外貨源源運來物價將漸趨跌</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕多方囑目之外匯市塲，昨晨十時，在中央銀行宣佈當日對美電匯率爲二〇二〇元後，已告正式開放。該項電匯率，終日未動。二十七家指定銀行及核定之外匯經紀人，均參照銀行及經紀人，以外匯市塲開放伊始，對中行所規定之各項買賣手續，不無生疏之感，且各經紀人與指定銀行問之對講電話，又未裝置完竣，故全日交易極爲清淡，匯市始終平穩。其間中國銀行在外匯率未決定前，曾接受各出口商之押匯借款，當時暫照一千元之匯率計算，昨日各出口商，乃分往結取押匯借款之匯率差額，中國銀行槪照一九三〇元之匯率結付之，至遠期外匯之買賣，尚未開做。</p>
<p>指定各銀行昨首次會議</p>
<p>記者曾於昨晚趨訪中央銀行外匯審核處長林維英氏，承告：中央銀行開放外匯市塲，宣佈當日對美電匯率後，市塲反應極良好，行市終日平靜。中行今日已將各式申請表格，印刷竣事，昨日甲種准許經營行號往中行申請者，有十餘家，乙種准許經營行號往巾行申請者，有中國旅行社一家，又悉：二十七家指定銀行，曾於昨日下午，在中國銀行之召集下，舉行首次會議。席間對籌組指定經營外匯銀行業同業公會，及今後業務之開展聯繫，討論頗詳。</p>
<p>外匯經紀人公會已成立</p>
<p>至業經核定之外匯經紀人十六家，昨亦假博物院路九號，成立上海市外匯經紀人業同業公會。出席全體會員十六家，當席推定郭寳樹。溫德華。韋伯祥。董璇笙·克拉克五人爲委員，而以郭寳樹爲生任委員，溫德華爲副主任委員云。</p>
<p>人心極安定前途殊樂觀</p>
<p>又昨據市商會理事長王曉籟談，外匯開放後，本市商界咸以外貨將可源源運華，故人心極爲安定，對前途允抱樂觀，預料本市物價將由平穩而漸趨下跌云。</p>
<p>預訂奢侈品進口須申請</p>
<p>政府公佈之「進出口貿易暫行辦法」，規定各項奢侈品屬於第三類禁止進口物品，本市進。商以該辦法公佈前向外國訂購之奢侈品，數量甚鉅，或已啓運在途，或以合同訂明，不能退貨，莫不焦急萬分。記者昨向江海關當局探詢，據告如在三月一日以前訂購之不准進口物品，必須在十日以內向海關由請，獲得核准後，始能進口，逾期不能接受。又禁止出口物品，如係於三月一日前由外商訂購者，亦須申請核准後，始能出口。</p>
<h3>長江上游水　輪運困難日增</h3>
<p>長江上游水位低落，與歷年相比，實屬罕見。據航業界訊，上月下旬宣昌報告，最低爲水位零下九時，致航運益增困難。民生公司民福·民來·兩輪，於上月底由宜上駛，經靑　絞　時，絞　竟遭折斷，因之無法過　。爲避免危險計，已回駛宜昌。據航粟界稱，如水位不再上漲，恐船舶將不能直駛宜昌。渝宜段運輸，須分兩段，即渝萬段，萬宜段，故長江全綫勢將分爲四段矣。又訊，二月份由渝東下之船隻，共二十次，除二三兩次已駛京漢外，其餘全部駛至宜昌。共計運客六千一百四十餘人，貨運八百六十餘噸，爲復員以來運輸最低數量，其原因實爲水枮。</p>

<h3>囚犯吳江冷　以殺人罪被控　自稱爲政治犯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自政府決定釋放政治犯後，各方皆甚表關切。記者頃自提籃橋上海監獄方面探悉，該獄現並無政治犯覊押，前敵僞時代因愛國工作被捕之人犯，已於去年八九月間保釋。日來會向報界呼籲而自稱爲政治犯之楊執中等七人，係以前由僞保安司令部所逮捕，近已由高檢處偵訊後，於二月二十三日移解接收該部之淞滬警備司令部辦理。彼等宣稱曾絕食五日，要求早日援政治犯例釋放，但事實上彼等减食則有之，若眞絕食至五日之久，則彼等恐早已餓斃。現獄中自稱爲政治犯者祇吳江冷一人，但彼乃以殺人罪被控，故高院仍以普通刑事犯視之。</p>
<h3>日戰犯石原勇　受美軍法庭審訊</h3>
<p>充任翻譯主任作惡多端</p>

<p>下午續審傳訊證人</p>
<p>午間，傳矢澤利彥到處作證。彼曾在吳淞與江灣兩處工作，曾親見石　勇虐待各戰犯。當時各戰犯多爲美海軍陸戰隊隊員，或各地美國這領事館員。石原勇爲要收取各人口　，不恥下此毒辣手叚。該證人自稱：「　親敎不說謊言，故今日作證，均是實話」。但其後矢澤利彥又稱，石原勇爲人不偏不倚，視法令軍紀，如山似鐵，雖曾虐待戰犯，但又爲營內戰犯福利着想，並請敎士到營中爲各人　　，並解私囊，以牛奶供給病者。原告辯護人問：石原勇旣如此「仁慈」，爲何「　打戰犯」？答：「以彼爲人守法」。其再後傳森迫一記出庭作證。與矢澤所供略同。彼二人均曾任江灣與吳淞兩集中營翻譯，與石原勇同事，此案定今晨九時再審。</p>

<p>昨爲外匯開放之第一日，交易時間，由中央銀行規定爲每星期一二四五上午十時至十二時，下午二時至三時，星期三六，祗有上午市面，下午停做，昨爲星期一，中央業務局外匯科，遵章於上午十時公佈美金電匯率爲二千〇二十元，即以此價格通知十六名之外匯經紀人，及廿七家指定銀行，期貨買賣暫不開做，對英匯價，亦未決定，可由美金匯價推算，此項價格，並非固定，將視市面供求情形，隨時伸縮，指定銀行亦可依頭寸多寡及交易多少爲轉移，昨日各行以請結外匯申請書等未及印就，故均無交易，又訊結進外匯，其進口商品須先呈請海關當局簽准，而後由指定銀行代爲辦理，如賣出，先向銀行治妥外匯數額，再向海關呈驗出口商品，一切賣買均須爲正常貿易，其數額微少並僑外人員生活費等，可經與銀行當局陳述理由，並具相當證明，亦得賣買，至於黃金買賣，依照中央規定，本與美匯同樣辦理，但昨日亦未正式公佈云。</p>

<h3>一部份遊資活動　新港票又步漲　美鈔回好三十元</h3>

<h3>溫紅茶價再跌</h3>
<p>溫州紅茶，今日市上現貨散佈甚多，客方相繼傾吐，是以價格支持無力，結果每担比上週再降二千元，其他花色，依然平穩，惟行情以貨品軒輊不一，故較前榮辱互見，實則大有名動暗定之勢，至於洋行方面，邇來仍見垂青，且尤以南美洲需貨更亟，聞本市有一部份制茶廠，於日內擬復工趕製。</p>

<p>德孚洋行顏料，自萬歷年前開派一批後，迄無開出，後經染織業工會向敵偽產業處　局申請放寬派貨額度，並建議根據各廠生產能力派獲，不能祗以廠存坯布爲調查對象，雖經覆兩贊同，而最近所開派之第二批貨，爲數仍不多，且其價提升甚速，其中如陰丹士林　第一批派價，每担近三百萬元左右，而此次竟漲至一千六百二十萬之鉅，染織公會正在要求核低派價云。</p>

<h3>戰時浙江文化搖籃　國立英士大學掠影（上）</h3>
<p>— 黃藍</p>
<p>國立英士大學，這在收復區的人看來也許還是個陌生的名字。爲的是它成立的歷史太短暫了；也爲的是它在戰爭中的流浪播　太劇烈了。實際上從杭嘉　失守浙大遷黔後，它便是浙江唯一的一所完整大學。七年來它一直蟄伏在山間，分佈于小鎭，在在給各地有志向學青年以繼續進修的機會，也在在給從苦難中尋找新生的祖國培育了不少新的人才。如今杭戰是勝利了，在戰後建設的廣泛需要之下，它之必得卸却舊服穿上新裝這是絕無疑義的，這兒讓筆者把它的產生經過以及目前情形，未來展望做個綜合報告如下：</p>
<p>（一）產生經過</p>
<p>民國二十八年間，浙江省敎育局爲紀念革命先烈陳英士先生生前的豐功偉績，一面爲補救當時文化中心西移後東南高等敎育的　枯現象，乃發起成立「浙江省立英士大學」一所於浙東之　水域。計設農，工，醫三院，用　國家培養實科人才之意。這便是目前英大的前身。民國三十二年，陳立夫先生接長敎部，認爲英大有調整擴大的必要，乃一面將其改歸國立，一面將東南聯大法學院全部劃歸英大。另又析出工學院獨立而爲「國立北洋工學院」；並在英大添設行政，財政，會社，合作，藝術五種專修科。校址因戰事影響從麗水撤至雲和，復由雲和遷到泰順之里光司前諸鄉。客　朱家驊先生就任敎長時，下令再度調整全國高等敎育，英大醫學院聯合作藝術兩專科　合改倂；「國立北洋工學院」重新劃歸英大，這便造成月前法，農，工三院和其他三專修科的局面。其後，抗戰勝利。留在雲和之三種專修科追隨省府轉進杭州，英大校本部亦因便利復員計　遷至　　之溫州，以上便爲英大七年來變遷的經過情形。</p>
<p>（二）校務概況</p>
<p>目前法學院計設法律，政治，經濟三系。農學院設農藝，畜牧獸醫，農業經濟三系。工學院設機電工程，土木工程，化學工程三系。劇校長杜佐周氏發表談話：下年度次增設一文理學院，將來更擬恢復醫學院，添辦師範學院等。最近全校行政會議，通過一重要決議案，即建議敎部准予本校於系之下採用分組制，藉以應和戰後各項需要。茲探得其分組計劃如下：計法學院法律系分司法，行政法學兩組（按係部令），政治系分理論政治，行政，外交三組。經濟系分財政學，金融學，計政學，經濟學四組。農學院農藝系分農作物，農業化學，植物病虫害三組。畜牧獸醫系分畜牧，獸醫兩組。農業經濟系分農業經濟學，農業金融兩組。工學院等酌情添系，不另分組。現正　具計劃報部審查中，一俟　准，即可付諸實行云。</p>

<h3>換我們的靈魂來！</h3>
<p>— 喬政</p>
<p>抗戰勝利，勝利帶給我們的是什麽？八年淪陷的痛苦，我們覺得悲傷，頹唐。任什麽花舌巧語，說得天圓地方，亦挽不回我們破碎的心靈！我們祗覺得空虛，失　。</p>
<p>我們是一羣可憐的學徒，也和學校中的學生一樣，我們是學藝來的，但是我們却過着奴隸似的生活，我們好似一羣猴子，老板經理則好似牽猴兒的賣藝者，我們爲他們出血汗，他們却坐收漁利。我們做着牛馬還不如的事，有事還要受他們的咤駡，甚至還要挨鞭笞，而我們一月所得的零用錢，還不夠他們買幾包煙的錢！每日吃的只是殘羹冷飯！</p>
<p>報上的社評說得好：『……敎育爲建設的根本，我們正應移其注意於敎育，我們很同意目前應是「敎育至上」……』八年中，多方面的痛苦，迫得我們喘不過氣來，我們拋棄了書本，離了學校，幹着受人歧視的學徒生涯，做着牛馬還不如的事，我們雖然物質上受到痛苦，但我們的精神上很愉快，我們的心靈上有着極大的理想，盼望勝利的及早來臨，使我們重有求學的機會，願光明之火溫暖了我們的心房。如今勝利雖然來臨，然光明之火在那裏呢？我們的心冷了，我們的希望成了泡影，怎不呌我們痛心疾首！</p>
<p>我們只有義務，沒有權利，我們也是人啊！我們也是父母所養，也有血有肉，有頭顱，也有眼，鼻和口，但爲什麽我們却要過着似牛馬的生涯？爲什麽我們的靈魂却抓在別人的掌握中呢？我們也有理智，有情感，爲什麽我們的自由要讓別人支配？我們不是一羣「聽天由命」的任人宰割者，我們需要高呼：還我們的靈魂來！我們也是人！</p>

<h3>時間的運用</h3>
<p>— 小山</p>
<p>時間是我們最大的財產，需要好好的運用。</p>
<p>用時間去生活。時間原是爲着生活的。浪費時間，等於不想生活——自殺。</p>
<p>用時間去工作。生活裏第一件事就是工作，不做工是對人生的一個虧欠。</p>
<p>用時間去友愛。人生是「彼此」的，永遠不能一個人走到終點。朋友多是一種超絕的榮耀。</p>
<p>用時間去思想。思想是產生權利的，牠會對你發令，也會對人類發令。</p>
<p>用時間去遊玩。伴着老年人玩，你會從他的白髮裏得到智慧；伴着小孩子玩，小孩子會把你的虛僞洗淨；伴着青年人玩，青年人是新鮮的製造廠。</p>

<h3>一筆算不清的賬</h3>
<p>— 徐濖卿</p>
<p>戰前戰後的千債關係，如果涉起訟來原被兩造的目的，一定是南轅北轍，相去遙遠，而雙方的理由，也一定是公說公有理，婆說婆有理，各有其理。假使國家沒有適當的新法令頒佈，那司法官將大傷腦筋，而兩造都會感到審判不公約，所以我奉勸債權債務人，最好大家不要涉訟，下面所述的「一筆算不清的賬」，便是絕好的一個例子。</p>
<p>我有一個相識的老嫗，在抗戰開始（廿六年秋間）那年，以法幣一千元存入一家米行，利息當然極微，存入數年，本利均未支取，後來那地方淪陷了，這老嫗退入自由區，對於這筆存款，索性置之度外了。而這米行在淪陷以後，因爲通行僞幣，而且法幣兩元，祗値僞幣一元，所以把一切存欠款項，一概結算，折成僞幣。當然老嫗所存法幣一千元，加上兩三年來的利息五六百元，本利合計有一千五六百元，兩作一折成僞幣祗有七八百元了。去年敵人投降，老嫗返籍，因爲環境遠不如昔，所以派人向米行提取這筆存款，那米行執事人說歷年利息，雖都揭清，而本年的利息，還待核算，準於明日送奉。那人去後，司賬的結算之下，老嫗存款，本利在內，不足僞幣二千元，如果易以法幣，就是不到十元。司賬員把這話向經理報告以後，經理不覺笑了起來說，我們賬憑簿據，按時折合，論情論理，原無不錯，但是人家存入時是法幣一千元，而我們現在時隔七八年，本利一併在內，還不到法幣十元，可以說人家以法幣一百元，存在我們行內七八年，連本合利，還給他法幣一元，這是大笑話。何況這存戶和本行是有相當關係的呢？可是司賬員請敎經理怎樣結算時，那經理也祗是笑着沒有滿意的辦法。最後那經理吩咐司賬員摘了一紙帳單，結存僞幣一千幾百幾元，派人送交老嫗。那老嫗請人細細閱看，而且解釋怎樣法幣折合僞幣，那老嫗聽說所存不到法幣十元，隨即把那張帳單撕毀。她說我那時所存法幣一千元，米價每石祗法幣九元，一千元法幣，可以買米一百十石有餘，現在十元錢有什麽用呢？我現在窮也窮了，要它何用呢？</p>
<p>這筆算不清的賬，因爲雙方都有情感關係，最後由那米行經理送給老嫗食米三石，算是了清這項存款。可是老嫗還在背地裏說，我眞是倒楣，一百十多石米，存了七八年，祗有三石了。同時那米行經理也在說，現在米價每石五千元（時政府規定米價五千元市上也不相上下），三石米計法幣一萬五千元，合僞幣三百萬元，不到二千元的存款，還了三百萬元，平均每一元還一千五百元，眞是有說不出的苦！</p>
<p>在這樣和平解決之下，雙方的論調尚且各執其詞，倘使涉起訟來，試問怎能呌兩造都感滿意呢？</p>

<h3>上海的水道交通</h3>
<p>— 一鳴</p>
<p>水利除供灌溉田園外，對於交通上亦佔着重要的地位，單說上海，陸路很是發達，可以算是江南一帶陸道之總樞，但是，在水道方面呢？除了外洋航路外，就簡直說不出多大値得頌述的。如蘇州河，原係上海的內河交通總匯，下流至黃浦江，上溯可及蘇州，可惜，現在的蘇州河上，已是汙塞不堪，每日除了潮漲的時候外，河面就驟然大窄，以致難能行駛船隻。這雖是一件小事，但一件平常的事，對於上海交通上，商業上的影響，確是不能渺視的，窃思如欲增加上海商業上的繁榮，及欲使內河交通暢達，必須注意下列二點：</p>
<p>（一）疏浚　河流在汙塞的時候，必須疏浚，否則日日積之，水淺而舟難行，有妨水道交通，上游又多有泛濫的危險。</p>
<p>（二）公德　河流的汙塞，雖多由上游的泥沙沖積所成，但一方面是因人民不顧公德所致。眼看着蘇州河畔，堆足着垃圾一類的東西，這就是蘇州河所以汙塞的一大根原。所以欲蘇州河不至汙塞，人民務須以公德爲重，而當局亦須加以督促。</p>
<p>好癖</p>
<h3>蒐集鈕扣</h3>
<p>— 虹光</p>
<p>今日美國除了集郵票和集古幣，最盛行的第三種嗜好，是蒐集鈕扣。最近洛杉磯集鈕會開第三次年會時，有二十萬種類以上的鈕子展覽着，有的價値數百元美金，可是沒有人能夠估計出全部展覽品的價值。</p>
<p>集鈕的流行，祗在最近四年中才奇妙地興起來。但是它實在起源於一八九〇年的娛樂節，那一次年輕的女郎蒐集了鈕子，做一種呌做迷人繩的玩藝，做的時候要留心：不要將九百九十九種相同的鈕子穿在一根繩上，傳說那得到一千只相同鈕子的人，將永遠做老處女，這種嗜好傳了不久，就冷淡下去，可是今日全美國倒又有千萬個蒐集鈕子的人了，像加利福尼亞省，有專爲兒童與青年設的初級集鈕會，這種鈕子多數係由骨動店或佔衣鋪裏購得的，全國集鈕總會欲使得這種嗜好較爲科學化起見，曾出版了一本八十頁的季刊雜誌，刊載着新式或稀見的各種消息。</p>

<h3>Yu Hongjun Attends the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee, Elaborating on Eight Financial Measures, Future Will Enter a Peacetime State</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 4th] The Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee held its third general meeting on the morning of the 4th. Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun delivered a report on financial issues, stating briefly: Today, I am reporting to the general meeting on financial matters. Detailed information about the work of the Ministry of Finance over the past nine months has already been compiled into a written report, submitted to the Executive Yuan for compilation and distribution. Now, I will only select the most important and concerning aspects for everyone to present a simple report. This report is divided into the following eight items: (1) Current central financial policy, (2) Improvement of the tax system, (3) Changes in materials control, (4) Financial control issues, (5) Stabilizing currency value, (6) Enriching local finances, (7) Balancing national treasury revenue and expenditure, (8) Rectifying the discipline of tax officials.</p>
<p>Current Central Financial Policy</p>
<p>1.  Current central financial policy. The convening of this meeting is approximately nine months from the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee. In the past nine months, there have been significant changes in both domestic and international situations, and the government's policies must naturally undergo various new decisions and implementations. Today's finance is in a transitional state from wartime finance supporting the war to peacetime finance for reconstruction, which is a financial policy centered on demobilization. The guidelines implemented by the Ministry in the past few months and to be followed in future plans are: 1. Improve the tax system to equalize the distribution of people's wealth and promote the development of domestic industries; 2. Allocate provincial and county tax revenues to enrich local finances, in order to promote economic construction and complete self-government; 3. Use international cooperation to stabilize exchange rates with gold, foreign exchange, and materials to stabilize currency value, thereby reducing the issuance of legal tender, guiding finance to productive avenues, and promoting the country's international trade; 4. Utilize enemy and puppet industries and the surplus economic power of the international community to supplement national financial resources and further balance national treasury revenue and expenditure. All of these are based on the various principles extracted and summarized from the various principles of the Party's program and policies passed sincerely by the entire congress. The various issues reported below are what the Ministry has implemented in accordance with these principles.</p>
<p>Improvement of the Tax System</p>
<p>2.  Improvement of the tax system. After the victory, national finance should gradually transition from wartime to peacetime. Our country's current tax system has mostly been reviewed and improved to meet the needs of future national construction. The objectives of improvement can be summarized into three main points: First, strive for simplification of the tax system; Second, coordinate with future economic construction; Third, utilize the tax system to improve the distribution of social wealth. After the victory, in terms of direct tax improvements, various exemptions for necessities have been adopted, and the new progressive tax rates have also been appropriately increased. On the one hand, the principle of "those with money contribute money" is implemented, and on the other hand, the burden on the poor is reduced. After this improvement of our country's tax system, it seems that with time and the development of production industries, direct taxes will be the main framework, supplemented by various commodity taxes, to complete a sound tax system.</p>
<p>Changes in Materials Control</p>
<p>3.  Changes in materials control. Before the victory, the types of materials controlled by our government were numerous. Those under the jurisdiction of the Ministry included the control of cotton yarn, the monopoly of salt, the taxation in kind of wheat flour and sugar, and the unified purchase and sale of tung oil, bristles, wool, tea, raw silk, etc. Now, all past methods have been changed, which on the one hand, can facilitate the flow of goods and benefit merchants and people, and on the other hand, can also promote production and increase tax revenue. Now, the control of cotton yarn has been abolished, the control of salt has also been abolished, and the taxation in kind part has been changed back to collecting tax payments. Regarding import and export materials originally controlled solely for wartime needs, they have been amended or abolished separately. (1) Abolish the regulations on blocking, prohibiting, and inspecting materials entering and exiting; (2) Abolish the unified purchase and sale methods for tung oil, bristles, wool, tea, raw silk, etc.; (3) Simplify the items of controlled materials. The Trade Commission, which was in charge of this business during the war, and its three affiliated companies have also been abolished one after another. Recently, the Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade have been announced and implemented.</p>
<p>Regarding Financial Control Issues</p>
<p>4.  Financial control issues. After the victory of the war, the first priority in financial policy is to improve the banking system so that various banks can operate in accordance with the law. The Ministry has drafted nine regulations, which have been approved by the Executive Yuan meeting and sent for completion of the legislative process. They will be implemented soon. In the future, various banks will have paths to follow in their operations, and the banking system will rely on this to be sound. The second is to manage banking operations. Now that the war of resistance has been won, the laws and regulations for managing banks should be appropriately relaxed to enable financial development to cultivate the economy. However, during this period of reconstruction and construction, the use of bank funds should focus on supporting productive industries. The Ministry should urge continued processing to improve the bank accounting system and promote the bill system to improve credit instruments, stabilize market interest rates, and develop the economy. Methods have been formulated for compliance. In the future, if transportation returns to normal, factories gradually resume work, and international routes are unblocked, so that the management of banking operations can proceed in coordination, then the Ministry's control over finance can show considerable results.</p>
<p>Stabilizing Currency Value and Enriching Finance</p>
<p>5.  Stabilizing currency value. The first is to open the foreign exchange market, the second is to reorganize enemy and puppet banknotes, and the third is to handle banknotes in Taiwan and the Northeast. As for the main points of the Central Bank's provisional measures for managing foreign exchange, they can be summarized into three: (1) Abolish official prices; (2) The Central Bank may supply or purchase foreign exchange at any time to stabilize the foreign exchange market, and gold can be handled in the same way; (3) All foreign exchange deposits must not be increased, and each depositor should sell the remaining balance to the Central Bank at the market price on the day no later than the end of September of this year.</p>
<p>6.  Enriching local finances. The Ministry of Finance, based on the Party's policy, pays attention to the improvement of autonomous finance at any time. After the victory, in order to plan for financial reconstruction, a plan has been drafted, which has been studied by the Financial Professional Committee and is now being submitted to the National Defense Council for instructions.</p>
<p>7.  Balancing national treasury revenue and expenditure. This year's war of resistance has ended. In the financial reconstruction plan, balancing national treasury revenue and expenditure is a prerequisite. Therefore, follow the following guidelines to carry out budget preparation. On the revenue side: (1) Aim to restore pre-war revenue; (2) Accurately estimate the relationship between tax rates, tax amounts, and prices; (3) Expand the scope of all possible revenue. On the expenditure side: (1) Seek a reasonable proportion of military expenditure as much as possible; (2) Effectively coordinate with post-war relief plans; (3) Tighten unnecessary expenditures.</p>
<p>Rectifying the Discipline of Tax Officials</p>
<p>8.  Rectifying the discipline of tax officials. In the past year, the Ministry has abolished a total of 610 affiliated institutions and 180,86 people at all levels. The purpose is to adjust operations, simplify institutions, and prepare for the initial stage of improving personnel and establishing systems. A comprehensive review is currently underway. In the future, the policy of employing personnel will be to start with examinations to prevent favoritism, conduct assessments to rectify the atmosphere, provide good treatment to attract talents, and strengthen guarantees to encourage long-term careers. On the negative side, the Ministry has always encouraged the reporting of corruption cases. All reported cases, whether anonymous or signed, are accepted, and those found to have illegal activities or proven corruption will be dealt with severely without any leniency to serve as a warning. Conclusion: The above is a general overview of the Ministry's measures on several important current financial issues. I hereby conduct a thorough review and provide a concise report to all comrades of the Congress.</p>

As for the various speculations from the outside, they are all intentional slander and not worth refuting. Subsequently, Cheng Qian, He Chengjun, and Zhang Zhiben successively expressed their opinions, emphasizing the necessity of party and government reform. Zhang also said that the reform movement is actually a "restoration movement," that is, to restore the revolutionary spirit of the Kuomintang fifty years ago in order to realize the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution. The whole audience applauded warmly, and the meeting adjourned at 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 3rd] After Ma, Zhang, and Zhou arrived in Bing, they listened to the group's report and held talks with the military and political leaders here until 10:00 PM without reaching an agreement. It is currently determined that the take-off time tomorrow (4th) will be delayed by one hour, and a meeting will be held again in the early morning.</p>
<h3>Financial, Economic, and Monetary Report Will Continue to Be Reviewed This Morning. Yesterday, Various Committee Members Spoke Mostly Advocating Increased Production</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 4th] Second Central Committee</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 4th] The Third General Assembly of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee continued to be held at 3:20 PM on the afternoon of the 4th. Committee Member Bai Chongxi presided, and Weng Wenhao delivered an economic report, which lasted one hour and twenty minutes. After the break, the meeting continued at 5:00 PM. The Chairman announced the review of the financial, economic, and monetary reports. Chen Xihao spoke first, pointing out that the monetary system in Xinjiang has not yet been reorganized, which has led to rising prices and made it almost impossible for comrades working in the border areas to make a living. He hoped to speed up the reorganization of the new currency and increase the treatment of comrades working in the border areas. Yang Jizeng believed that according to the currency ratio, the current national budget cannot be said to be too large. The government should have a way to control the budget to balance revenue and expenditure. Pan Gongzhan said that with regard to finance and economy, if there is no way to deal with economic production, then it is impossible to balance financial revenue and expenditure. He cited that factories in Shanghai and other areas are still at a standstill, and there is no exact number of received materials. According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, even the most satisfactory Shanghai area in terms of reception is still like this, so the situation in other places can be imagined. Because factories are at a standstill, idle funds have no proper outlet, so they tend to speculate, and the government has not decided on the prices of gold and foreign exchange for a long time, giving speculators an opportunity to take advantage of. Over the past few months, due to the stimulation of fluctuations in gold and US dollar prices, prices have generally risen. Taking Shanghai as an example, the price index has risen by four times from October last year to February this year. In the future, all sectors of the country should assist in supervising the financial situation, tightening the currency, and recovering the large amount of currency in the hands of the people. He also called on the authorities on behalf of the people of the southeastern provinces to continue to redeem puppet currency. Song Yishan proposed saving money and increasing revenue and encouraging savings to bring legal tender back into circulation. Cheng Zhongxing emphasized the extreme difficulties of local finances, believing that if local areas have solutions, the central government will have solutions. Since the exemption of agricultural taxes, local governments have fallen into a state of chaos. He also pointed out that private banks and money shops in the counties along the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) line have all been suspended and should be reorganized as soon as possible, and the power in various places should be restored to increase local production. Regarding the handling of enemy and puppet industries in various provinces and regions, only local people participate in the matter, and the central supervisory agency has no way to intervene. He believes that this violates the five powers and ignores the power of supervision, and expresses his protest. Deng Feihuang believed that the difficulties in finance and the disorder in finance can be explained by two examples: one is the loss of confidence in the gold policy, and the other is the mismatch between the puppet currency and the legal tender at a ratio of 200 to 1. He also questioned why the funds frozen in the United States have not yet been withdrawn, and why it is not possible to investigate national disaster wealth and speculative non-share income and impose heavy taxes on them. The review ended at 6:00 PM, and the Chairman announced the adjournment. The secretariat reported that the conference will continue to review financial, economic, and monetary affairs on the morning of the 5th and report on foreign affairs.</p>
<h3>Eastern Mongolia Requests Autonomy and the Northeast Headquarters Has Refused</h3>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 4th] Four representatives from Eastern Mongolia, sent by the Mongolian People's Assembly to make independence requests, were disclosed in a private conversation here yesterday by one of the representatives, Mr. Sangkejabu. They wanted to request autonomy from the central government, but were rejected by the Northeast Headquarters. Sang said that Mongolia has wanted to obtain autonomy for 35 years, and this is the fourth time. They do not have any party or foreign forces as their backing. The Mongolian people do not have enough strength and do not want to establish a republic. The area they are requesting for autonomy extends 150 kilometers north of Changchun to the border of Outer Mongolia, east to Hulun, and west to Pingquan, with a population of about 1.7 million. The Mongolian people all understand the current complex international relations and feel that the time is not yet right to request autonomy, so they are willing to wait until China has achieved peace and security. However, if the central government does not allow autonomy, the Mongolian people will rise up and fight. The 553 members of the Mongolian People's Assembly, 60% are workers and farmers, 10% are small industrial merchants, 12% are soldiers, 8% are government officials, and the remaining 10% are landlords, monks, and women, etc. were all elected on November 1. The Mongolian people firmly oppose oppression from the central government, the Communist Party, or the Soviet Union. No matter who tries to interfere, the Mongolian people will resist.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Japanese Prisoners of War in the Northeast Have Been Transported to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 3rd] According to a report from the Columbia Broadcasting Company's correspondent in Shenyang, Mora, the commander of the Soviet army in the Northeast, Stankevich, told American reporters yesterday when he hosted a press conference that a large number of Japanese prisoners of war, from 500,000 to 1 million people, have been transported to the Soviet Union. It is also said that Shi said: "He has no knowledge of the US plan to send Japanese expatriates in the Northeast back to their country."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The Washington Evening Star published an editorial today stating that the US's concerns and suspicions cannot be eliminated until the issue of the Soviet Union's removal of industrial equipment in the Northeast is clarified. The Soviet Union's sudden action to take this action without notifying the United States, China, and other United Nations countries is clearly an opportunistic act. Even if the Soviet Union has the right to share a portion of the Northeast's equipment, it has no reason to take any items at this time. This issue should "obviously" be handled by a compensation committee jointly formed by the United Nations.</p>
<h3>5,000 Japanese Prisoners of War in Nanjing Dredge the Qinhuai River</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 4th] 5,000 Japanese prisoners of war have now been ordered to undertake the work of dredging the Qinhuai River. The last batch of 2,038 Japanese expatriates left for Shanghai today in preparation for repatriation. There are only 600 Japanese expatriates left here, who are assigned to work in various agencies.</p>
<h3>Zhang, Zhou, and Ma Fly to Gui Sui and Yan'an, Three People Scheduled to Inspect Wuhan Today</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Hankou, 4th] The three-person military group, Zhang Zhizhong, Zhou Enlai, and Marshall, are scheduled to fly to Wuhan tomorrow afternoon for inspection. Their advance team will arrive here today, and all sectors are preparing a grand welcome. In addition, Zhu Xiannian, commander of the Communist Central Plains Military Region, Chief of Staff Zheng Weisand, and Political Commissar Chen Shoudao, and others arrived in Hankou yesterday from Xuanhua Store and are scheduled to visit Commander-in-Chief Guo today. According to Zhu, the purpose of this trip is to report the military mediation situation in the Central China region to the three people of Zhang, Zhou, and Ma.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 4th] Zhang, Zhou, Ma, and a group of 35 people took off in two large planes this morning at 9:20 AM and flew to Gui Sui, starting their fourth day of inspection. After a short stay in Suiyuan, they will transfer to Yan'an in the afternoon. The heads of the party, government, military, and groups and the three representatives of the executive group went to the airport to see them off.</p>
<p>Lei Ke's Achievements in Shandong Province</p>
<p>[United Press, Jinan, 3rd] Colonel Lei Ke, the American representative of the Military Mediation Executive Department in Jinan, is physically strong and has a reputation for being capable. For several weeks, he has been conducting military mediation in the area around here and has rescued tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians from three cities surrounded by the Communist army. The three-person committee of Marshall and others came to Jinan today to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of the mediation situation, and Colonel Lei Ke also went to report. His subordinates described his work process as follows to the reporter: At that time, Lei Ke discovered that Yanzhou, Liaocheng, and Tai'an were all under siege by the Communist army. The defending troops in the city were central troops reorganized from puppet troops. Because the Communist army implemented a strict blockade, there was a food shortage in the city, and the soldiers and civilians were dying. With the full support of the central and Chinese Communist representatives in the group, Lei Ke took strict actions and ordered special vehicles to be loaded with food and personally escorted them into the Communist lines. On one occasion, a county magistrate appointed by the central government secretly passed the blockade line and appealed to Lei Ke to issue food. On the way back, he was besieged by agitators who claimed that he was related to the enemy and puppet governments during the war and that he must be executed. According to eyewitnesses, Lei Ke stepped forward and told the crowd, "You cannot execute him, you can execute me, but things will not be resolved because of this." The crowd backed down, and so the food, the county magistrate, and Lei Ke all passed through the blockade line into the city. Lei Ke's success in mediation is due in part to his courage and in part to his tenacity. He must strive to resolve any problem before it is resolved, so he is trusted by both sides. Perhaps this is why Lei Ke was able to submit such a report to Marshall today: "In this area, the situation is calm, the people in the besieged cities have been supplied with food, and there seem to be no difficulties at present."</p>
<p>Communist Troops Levy Grain and Allocate Funds in Henan Province</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 3rd] (1) More than 1,000 people from the Independent Regiment and the Anlu County Brigade fled from Lishan to Shoushan to assist the Communist Party in collecting agricultural taxes in Anlu County. (2) The Communist army recently collected more than 26,000 shi of grain in Xuanhua Store and is still continuing to plunder. (3) The Communist army in the south of Guangshan has recently repeatedly levied grain and allocated funds from the people. The first time, each bao (unit of organization) was asked for 15,000 catties of grain and 300,000 yuan. The second time, each bao was asked for 50,000 catties and 600,000 yuan. One bao was asked for 500,000 catties of grain and 500,000 yuan. (4) More than 1,000 people from the Communist army's Huang Lin Department recently detained many bao chiefs in Shanghe Store, Quexi, and ordered each bao to pay 5,000 catties of grain and 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 4th] Liu Bocheng, commander of the Communist Taihang Military Region, came to Bing with the three-person group on the 3rd and left Bing for Anyang on the morning of the 4th.</p>
<h3>Second Plenary Session Holds Memorial Week for the Premier; President Chiang Personally Attends and Instructs, Urging Calm and Composed Practical Discussions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 4th] The Second Plenary Session held the Premier's Memorial Week at 9:20 AM on the 4th. Attendees included President Chiang, Wu Jingheng, Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, Sun Ke, Dai Chuanxian, Li Jishen, Chiang Song Meiling, Wang Chonghui, Chen Cheng, Chen Guofu, and 291 others. President Chiang presided, leading the ceremonies. He then delivered an impromptu address, stating: The comrades have been enthusiastically reviewing issues for three days. I place immense hope in this spirit of love for the Party and the nation. This plenary session is related to the success or failure of our Party and the survival of the nation. All comrades must remain calm and composed, recognize the reality of the domestic and international environment, and study practical solutions, avoiding superficial and fragmented observations, and habitual grandstanding and empty rhetoric. The President then provided a detailed analysis of international relations and domestic conditions. Regarding the Political Consultative Conference, he believes this is a demonstration of the Party's responsibility to the nation and the people. We should promote its implementation for the benefit of the nation. However, the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution are the Party's consistent goals and are inseparable. Some people believe that as long as the Three Principles of the People are recognized, there is no need to adopt the Five-Power system. This point needs to be clarified in detail. The Constitution is a grand plan for the nation's long-term stability, and comrades should review it based on the Premier's important legacy. However, as decisions have already been made at the conference, we can only carefully plan remedies for the major deficiencies. Finally, he encouraged all comrades at the plenary session to ensure that all words and actions are purposeful, policy-driven, and magnanimous, avoiding being overly concerned with temporary gains and losses. The meeting should promote Party ethics, demonstrate a democratic spirit, and respect discipline, to complete the Party's mission of revolution and nation-building. The speech lasted 50 minutes, with enthusiastic applause several times throughout. After the speech, the Party member code of conduct was read, and the ceremony concluded.</p>
<h3>Tens of Thousands Boarding Ships in Kowloon; New First Army to Depart for the Northeast; Approximately Ten or More Soviet Divisions in the Eastern Nine Provinces</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] Chongqing Report: According to those recently returning to Chongqing from northern Cambodia, the exact number of Soviet troops in the Northeast is difficult to estimate, as they come and go frequently, wanting to leave but staying again, returning after leaving, with such instances occurring repeatedly. However, the approximate number is believed to be ten or more divisions (including the three divisions in Dalian), which is highly credible. As for the number of senior Soviet technical personnel who have already arrived in various locations in the Northeast in fields such as electrical appliances, chemicals, mining and metallurgy, civil engineering, construction, agriculture, meteorological research, and military industrial arts, the number is at least approximately 1,500 or more. The Japanese technical personnel currently remaining in the Northeast have been recruited by the Soviet army and are being prepared for further education. The number is astonishing. It is said that in the three major central mining complexes in the Fushun mining area alone, there are more than a thousand Japanese technicians. In recent days, the Soviet army has conducted exercises of varying scales in Dalian, Lushun, Changchun, and Shenyang. This is not surprising, as their spirit of "not forgetting danger in times of peace" has become an excellent tradition.</p>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 4th] Tens of thousands of soldiers from the Chinese New First Army, all seasoned veterans of the Burma campaign, are boarding American transport ships in Kowloon daily, preparing to depart for Qinhuangdao to strengthen the National Army's forces in the eastern nine provinces. This well-equipped unit began loading on the 21st of last month and will require ten more days to complete the transfer. The ships responsible for transportation were originally American landing ships, capable of carrying tanks and other mechanized equipment. Each warehouse-style warship's deck carries approximately 800 soldiers, crowded on top of rice sacks or other packages, along with over a dozen Jeeps and trucks arranged in rows. The entire army carries over 2,000 motorized vehicles and approximately 6,000 horses. The coastline is experiencing rough waves, and although the American sailors are skilled at navigation, they will likely struggle to cope. The First Army is a formidable Chinese force, well-dressed, and equipped with heavy firepower. During their operations in Burma, British and American officers praised their strong combat capabilities.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Shenyang Dispatch] Although the Soviet authorities returned the administrative authority of Shenyang to the Chinese government on December 25th of last year, to date, the number of Chinese municipal personnel and technicians sent to take charge of municipal work is no more than one thousand. Since January of this year, 15,000 troops from the "Chinese Government Army" have arrived in Shenyang, with troops arriving daily from the Jinzhou area. According to General Stankevich, commander of the Soviet garrison in Shenyang, the Soviet garrison in Shenyang began to withdraw in November of last year, but was subsequently ordered by his superiors to remain partially stationed. Although the Soviet military authorities have received orders not to interfere in Chinese diplomatic affairs, the numerous current problems compel me to contact General Peng Bisheng, commander of the Chinese army in Shenyang, and Mr. Dong Wenqi, mayor of Shenyang. The military situation around Shenyang is quite chaotic. There are frequent visits from individuals claiming to be generals of the Chinese government army, stating that they have thousands of troops under their command, but investigations reveal that they are imposters, and a few have been arrested by General Peng. There are also instances of armed forces impersonating government troops within the city, but they are not easily identified. Chinese government troops or other units are stationed in the villages around Shenyang. Regarding the issue of the withdrawal of Japanese prisoners of war, to my knowledge, 60,000 Japanese prisoners of war in the Shenyang area have been disarmed and then withdrawn, with their destination unknown. The Japanese army destroyed some of its military equipment, including multiple aircraft. Furthermore, Mr. Shi did not specify how the Soviet Union used the weapons received from Japan, only stating that some of them have been transferred to the Chinese police.</p>
<h3>Memorial Service Held in the Provisional Capital for Zhang Xinfu Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 4th] The memorial service for Mr. Zhang Xinfu and other eight martyrs who died on duty, was held by all circles of the provisional capital at the Youth Hall on the morning of the 4th. Representatives from the National Political Council and other national and local organizations, as well as schools, totaling approximately 3,000 people from 400 units attended. President Chiang, President Song, and the governments of the nine northeastern provinces and two municipalities sent representatives to present wreaths and elegiac couplets. Kong Geng presided over the memorial service, with Mo Dehui as the chief celebrant, and representatives from all sectors as attendant celebrants. Zhang Jia'ao, representing Li Junfu, provided a detailed account of the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Zhang Xinfu and the other eight martyrs, as well as the negotiations before and after the incident, based on a recent telegram from Mayor Dong Wenqi.</p>
<h3>U.S. Marine Corps in China Reduced by 12,000</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 4th] It was disclosed here today that 4,000 officers and soldiers from the U.S. Third Amphibious Force will be withdrawn from North China via Tanggu and Qingdao within the next week to implement the plan to gradually reduce the Marine Corps strength to 12,000. By the end of March, the available ships will be increased to complete the troop reduction. After the announcement was released yesterday by the China Theater Headquarters in Shanghai, the Third Amphibious Force immediately disclosed today that although the Marine Corps stationed in North China will be reduced by 12,000 officers and soldiers, the tactical effectiveness of the combat elements within the amphibious force will still be retained. The brief news release also stated, "The troop reduction will be completed by April 1st. This operation is in parallel with the reduction of personnel in the Pacific units of the Marine Corps to peacetime levels." The statement emphasized that the result of the troop reduction is to streamline and reorganize the Third Amphibious Force, but it does not mean the dismissal of any officers or soldiers.</p>
<h3>Attlee's Speech</h3>

<h3>Zaozhuang Declared Relieved Yesterday, Designated as a Co-Managed Area by Both the Nationalists and Communists</h3>
<p>Discussions are underway to restore transportation and ship out stored coal.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th Urgent Telegram] After Marshall, Zhang Zhizhong, and Zhou Enlai personally inspected Xuzhou this time, Zaozhuang, which had been besieged for three months, was declared relieved at 9:00 AM this morning. The Xuzhou Group of the Military Mediation Department is continuing technical discussions on the two major difficult problems of restoring transportation and shipping out 240,000 tons of stored coal from the Zhongxing Company. It is widely believed that after the stored coal in Zaozhuang is shipped out, coal prices in Nanjing and Shanghai will fall. The Zhongxing Coal Mining Company in Zaozhuang has been besieged for three months, but fortunately, most of the equipment is in the south, and the losses are not significant. However, due to the dispersal of the laborers and the lack of food, it will be difficult to resume work in the short term. It is reported that the relevant authorities intend to send personnel to assist in handling the aftermath. Zaozhuang has now been designated as a co-managed area, and it is said that the scope of co-management includes coal mines, transportation, and general security. Therefore, the reorganization and restoration of the Zhongxing Coal Mine will also have to wait until the management committee jointly formed by the Nationalists and Communists is established before it can be launched.</p>

<p>[Reuters, New York, 4th] In an article for the New York Times, Nehru stated: Colonialism must be abolished.

An empire in collapse attempting to rescue another empire that has collapsed earlier will only accelerate its own dissolution because colonialism is no longer suitable for modern trends.

The joint withdrawal plan for British and French troops in Lebanon is still under review.</p>
<h3>To Resist the Atomic Bomb, American Scientists Propose Four Effective Measures</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berkeley, California, 3rd] Physicist Dr. Robert stated in a report for the Naval Weapons Laboratory that the United States can resist an atomic bomb attack if it takes all effective defensive measures. As far as can be foreseen at present, the power of the atomic bomb will continue to develop, enough to cause a part of the country to collapse, but if there is sufficient defense in advance, the United States cannot be destroyed in one fell swoop. The effects of an atomic bomb attack can be mitigated by the following four measures: (1) Continue to maintain a leading position in atomic bomb research; (2) Maintain a sufficiently strong army, navy, and air force, all of which are trained in the use of the latest weapons; (3) Move important industries and munitions industries underground to protect them; (4) Maintain a sufficient intelligence agency operating abroad.</p>
<h3>The World's Greatest Sluice Gate</h3>
<p>This illustration offers a glimpse of the core equipment of the world's greatest sluice gate—the "Grand Coulee Dam" in America. This world's number one great dam, built on the Columbia River by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, aims to control and rectify the river's turbulent currents, develop electricity, supply water for irrigating farmland, and serve other state purposes. The dam's highest point is 553 feet (equivalent to 165.9 meters), and its reservoir extends upstream for 151 miles (equivalent to 231.6 kilometers), reaching all the way to the Canadian border. In the next twenty-five years, the water supplied by the "Grand Coulee" dam can irrigate 1.2 million acres of land (equivalent to 480,000 hectares) and power hydroelectric plants. The electricity generated from these hydroelectric plants can also supply electricity for lighting and power in rural villages, pastures, and cities, and drive machinery in various factories, as part of America's electrification plan. More than 40% of America's six million farms now have electric lighting and power equipment. This large dam project in the United States can serve as a good example for many countries to develop rural electrification after the war.</p>
<h3>Three Days of Heavy Snow in Paris, Two Feet Deep</h3>
<p>Unprecedented in History</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 3rd] Heavy snow fell for three days here, only stopping today. The situation is unprecedented in history.

<h3>Life Has Joy, Why Overthink?</h3>
<p>Anthropologist Issues Warning</p>
<p>[United Press Chicago, 4th] Anthropologist Dahlberg stated today: Humans should be carefree and not overthink. If we cannot do so, we will only be heading towards destruction. Dahlberg pointed out that the atomic bomb is only the beginning of the destruction caused by humans using "wax power." If we spend less time splitting atoms and more time enjoying the pleasures of life, the end of humanity is just around the corner.</p>

<p>The enemy Wu Zhilong, who served as the leader of the Special High Group of the enemy's military police in Wuxi, repeatedly led the enemy to carry out large-scale sweeps, killing countless patriotic comrades. At that time, the people of Wuxi changed color when they heard his name because of the many spies under his command. However, since the enemy's surrender, Wu knew that he would not be tolerated by national law and fled without a trace. It was once rumored that he had escaped into the Taihu Lake Maji Mountain and Xishan as a bandit leader, robbing passing merchant ships. After being besieged by the National Army without success, the military, political, and police organs in Wuxi, following the military commission’s order, are now issuing a warrant for his arrest and severe punishment.</p>

Most of them held short guns and flashlights, dressed in gray cloth uniforms or mixed with short clothes, carrying dry food bags, and one bandit wore a red duty belt. First, they set up outposts at the south end of the street, cut off the outdoor telephone lines, and then rushed to the residences and shops, using the excuse of checking household registration to lure them to open the doors and break in, prohibiting them from making a sound, and arbitrarily searching and robbing. They also forced them to hand over cash, gold, silver jewelry, and valuables. They carried the loot away by the original route at 3:00 AM. A total of ten households were robbed, including an old woman surnamed Zhang, who was tied up and injured. Zhang himself was burned by the bandits.</p>

This matter has been rumored in Tokyo for the past week, but the financial authorities neither admit nor deny it. After stealing 600,000 yen, the youth spent lavishly. In a large restaurant, he met a hostess who used to be a geisha. To win her heart, he showed off his wealth, which ultimately led to the case being solved. 150,000 yen was found on him, and 420,000 yen was found in his residence. This youth spent only 30,000 yen in new currency in a few days.</p>

<h3>Diverse Coastal City in South China: Fuzhou, a Kaleidoscope</h3>
<p>— Special dispatch by our newspaper on February 24th, from Mu Yun</p>
<p>After a full three days, the reporter traveled 450 nautical miles from Shanghai to Fuzhou.</p>
<p>Fuzhou—a diverse coastal city, truly brings warmth to travelers. Here, it is already late spring. Ancient banyan trees spread their enormous wings, quietly waiting for passersby to rest. Peach blossoms, white orchids, and nameless small flowers all face the spring breeze, emitting fragrance. Oranges, tangerines, loquats, olives... hang on the branches, waiting to be picked. Wheat ears and rapeseed flowers are spread flat in the fields of the plains. The quiet green Min River is filled with large, high-masted sailing ships drifting from overseas. Small boats, painted bright red, float under the long bridge. Drum Mountain and Flag Mountain on both sides embrace the soft streams and dilapidated long bridges. People are like being in the beautiful mountains, inhaling the breath of the spring earth. Life seems more active here.</p>
<p>Banyan City Has Many Beauties: Simple and Relaxed</p>
<p>Banyan City produces beauties. We have certainly paid attention to this rumor. The women here, just like other anti-Japanese inland areas, have a simple yet lively and cheerful tone. In the hot spring bathhouses on Shuibu and Wenquan Roads, there are female attendants and female back scrubbers (though not very openly). There are low-class "water girl"-like prostitutes, as well as private prostitutes who speak fluent Shanghai and Beijing dialects, and boat girls who row small boats during the day and live a mythical goddess life at night. Like rats (there is a not-so-severe plague going on now), Fuzhou has plenty of these types of women.</p>
<p>Superficially a Dance Hall, Actually a Flesh Market</p>
<p>Strolling along Zhongzheng Road, you'll find tea, umbrella, lacquerware, and fruit shops. People surge like tides. There are no cars, only narrow pedicabs that ring and run quickly. Occasionally, there is a Jeep, which attracts a lot of attention. The alleys and streets share the same characteristic: cleanliness, even when filled with swirling dust during the heat of noon. People can be entertained by the local Min opera and pre-war films forgotten by Shanghai residents. There are two dance halls, Queen and International. Queen uses a gramophone for accompaniment. International has only three or five musicians from Shanghai's Great World, playing out-of-tune, decadent music. The dancers are local girls, prostitutes, private prostitutes, and local socialites, dressed flamboyantly, dancing the bull walk, hugging the waists of dancers from Shanghai and Hong Kong, using the simplest Min dialect to seduce civil servants and travelers looking for excitement. Tea costs 300 yuan, only clear tea, nothing else. This is not a dance hall, but an open flesh market.</p>
<p>Prices Soaring: When Will Cheapness Return?</p>
<p>Alarming soaring prices have turned the lives of 310,000 people from ordinary to tense, and have also fueled the expansion of consumption. There are anecdotes circulating in the city about nouveaux riches who have made fortunes by going to Taiwan and Shanghai. They have become wealthy through speculation and manipulation. Taking rice prices in recent days as an example, they have soared from 7,000-8,000 yuan per stone to 15,000 yuan. Following rice, other daily necessities are also rising. The government is holding price stabilization efforts, and requesting 52,000 stones of tax rice to be shipped to Fuzhou as soon as possible. This serious problem has worried the Zhenshui Naval General, who has been inviting gentry and merchants to form a relief association, and the police station has paraded rice profiteers such as Lin Weifan in the streets to warn others. The Cuibao newspaper on the 15th had such a provocative headline: "Fuzhou rice prices reach 15,000 yuan, have the provincial leaders heard? Stabilizing prices are eagerly awaited, when will 'Pinggui return home'?" The provincial government spokesman publicly stated that they want to suppress prices to 10,000 yuan per stone, and all newspapers unanimously demanded "fulfillment!" Besides rice, tea, the famous Fujian Xiangpian, was still 100,000 yuan per dan ten days ago, but now it has risen to about 400,000 yuan and is still out of stock. However, general food stores are cheaper than those in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Female Students Wear Skirts, Male Students Wear Uniforms</p>
<p>From the perspective of education, Fuzhou has many schools, but the general education level is really too poor. We visited several elementary schools, and there were too many corrected words on the students' test papers. In the YMCA middle school, English is not tested in the first grade of junior high school. Most of the notices posted on the doors of wine shops and stores on the streets are illiterate. Even in the hotel, the notice from the official health office contains the phrase "Our staff has no many eyes and ears, and it is difficult to check everything, and there may be negligence...", a grammar that is rare. However, the fact that female students wear skirts and male students wear uniforms, and that they can all speak Mandarin, is quite pleasing.</p>
<p>The Press Suffers from Many Ailments: Freedom Is Seen as Tyranny</p>
<p>The decline in education levels, the high prices, and the difficulty in maintaining public order have also affected the activity of the cultural publishing industry. Newspapers and magazines from Shanghai are half a month or a month late, and the purchasing power of readers is very weak. Fuzhou currently has six newspapers, including Central Daily News, Justice Daily, Democracy News, Minhai Daily, Southern Daily, and Cuibao, all printed on local paper. They jointly raised prices on the 16th to maintain their capital. The actual sales volume is very poor, and the reports are common. People familiar with the inside story of the news industry severely pointed out the ailments of the Fuzhou news industry: They do not look forward to the abolition of the censorship system, as this would increase the burden on the newspaper and the editors. The freedom of the press and freedom of speech given by the government is actually spiritual and business tyranny!</p>
<p>Not Enough Ships to Taiwan: Crossing the Sea Is Harder Than Ascending to Heaven</p>
<p>Fujian's climate and geography are influenced by Taiwan, and although the two provinces are separated by a malignant and dangerous strait, they are actually closely linked. Especially with the current lack of transportation, Fuzhou has become Taiwan's rear supply station. People go from here to the neighboring province for business and politics, using sailing ships or shed boats that burn diesel and weigh about 100 tons. Many merchants made a fortune in Taiwan Province before the Taiwan dollar was converted into legal currency and before exports were controlled. The main transactions were sugar and bananas. There are now several ships that regularly go to Taiwan Province, but they are willing to carry goods, not passengers, because the freight rate per ton has increased from 30,000 to 120,000, while passenger tickets have only increased from 6,000 to 12,000. Therefore, as of now, there are more than a thousand people stranded in Fuzhou waiting to go to Taiwan, all trapped in inns and unable to cross the sea. There is a route from Fuzhou to Taipei on the newspaper. It is said that the runway at Yiyu Airport is broken and needs to be repaired, which will take two or three months. This will further reduce the traffic line to Taipei.</p>
<p>The diverse coastal city—Fuzhou, after being devastated twice by the enemy and puppets, has not found any other hoof prints except for some remnants left on Gushan Mountain. This city is just like a beautiful flower. As long as the social environment and customs change from complex to simple, and with practical construction, combined with the natural environment, irrigating the spring water in March, this flower will not wither.</p>
<p>The ancient South China city's style is enough to evoke long memories and nostalgia!</p>
<h3>Modern Buildings on Hainan Island</h3>
<p>Hainan Island, isolated overseas, is well-equipped and, like Taiwan, symbolizes one of China's eyes. Since its recovery, with organization and utilization, it will be like the finishing touch, making it even more beautiful. Cai Jinjun, who was recently sent to Hainan as the director of the Provincial Chairman's Office, said: "Hainan Island today is like a fair-looking village girl. With a touch of makeup, she will be charming." - Really, let this village girl quickly dress up!</p>
<h3>Communist Party Representatives Guests in Xuzhou</h3>
<p>— Special correspondent of this newspaper, Jiang Jun</p>
<p>Recently, a group of "strange guests" have been residing in the Tongshan branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League in Xuzhou – the Communist Party representatives and their entourage in the Fourth Mediation Group. The so-called "strange guests" are because these guests were previously the political enemies of the Three People's Principles, the believers of communism.</p>
<p>Driven by curiosity, and for the sake of this group of unfamiliar faces that are related to the future of our nation's military and political unity and national rejuvenation, people who pass by its door can't help but turn their heads and give it a fleeting glance.</p>
<p>This is a new-style building, quietly standing next to Qiming Road. Since it became the reception center for the Communist Party representatives, two guards of military police have been added outside to protect it. When the reporter went to visit, I felt that this house had a bit of "solemnity" added to it.</p>
<p>After a strict interrogation, a military police comrade took me to see the liaison adjutant of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters. I explained my purpose, and after about five minutes, the messenger led me to go. There was a military police guard at each of the two inner doors and the entrance to the stairs. When I reached the highest floor, the messenger returned, and a Communist soldier "escorted" me instead. At this time, I discovered that the separation between the upper and lower floors was just like the current military situation. The upper floor was completely a Communist world. The guards all wore blue-edged, white-bottomed, blue-lettered "New Fourth Army" badges. I thought to myself: "I have entered the Communist Army area."</p>
<p>"Was the procedure for you to come in very convenient?" Before I could open my mouth, Communist Party representative Wang Shiying asked me this question head-on.</p>
<p>"Very convenient." I truthfully replied to him.</p>
<p>So, he explained to me: In the past, when newspaper reporters went to visit him, they had to go through multiple negotiations and had to wear the "Pacification Headquarters" symbol. He added that I was the fifth reporter to meet him.</p>
<p>Deputy Chief of Staff Wang Shiying</p>
<p>Wang Shiying is of medium height, a burly physique, and a typical Northerner. He speaks with a Shanxi accent and often reveals the two gold teeth inlaid in his upper gums. He looks like a carpenter or a cook, but his attitude towards people is rough but meticulous, and he constantly uses new terms. He wore a newly made woolen, modified military uniform, with the rank insignia of a major general. His business card read: "Deputy Chief of Staff of the National Revolutionary Army Eighteenth Group Army."</p>
<p>Deputy Chief of Staff Wang Shiying said: "The scope of work of the Xuzhou Mediation Group includes the entire area under the jurisdiction of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters. As of now, the mediation work has made no concrete progress."</p>
<p>"The areas controlled by the Communist Party within the scope of the Xuzhou Mediation Group include the 'Central China Military Region' (the Subei area), the 'Shandong Military Region,' and a portion of the 'Jilu Military Region' (with the Jinpu Railway in Shandong Province as the boundary, the area east of the railway line is the 'Shandong Military Region,' and the area west of the railway line is the 'Jilu Military Region'). There are 'New Fourth Army' and 'Eighth Route Army' in each of these areas."</p>
<p>Both Sides Withdraw Sixty Li</p>
<p>"Regarding the Military Mediation Executive Department's order for both sides to withdraw their troops sixty li, the Communist Party believes that this regulation is beneficial to the National Army and difficult to comply with."</p>
<p>The reporter asked: Does the Communist Party's request for the National Army to withdraw from Lincheng and Zaozhuang hinder the restoration of the Jinpu Railway? Does it hinder the progress of the mediation work? He said: "Lincheng and Zaozhuang are located in the center of the vast area controlled by the Communist Army. The Communist Party believes that the threat is too great and must demand that the National Army withdraw."</p>
<p>"If both sides can make concessions, the mediation work will eventually be completed." This was his final explanation to the reporter, "to comfort himself."</p>
<p>That day, Wang Shiying specifically ordered someone to buy a pack of "Chesterfield" cigarettes to entertain the reporter.</p>
<p>Formal Representative Wei Guoqing</p>
<p>Wang Shiying is the Communist Party representative in the Xuzhou Mediation Group. A few days earlier, he flew to Peiping. The formal representative, Wei Guoqing, is the acting commander of the Second Division of the "New Fourth Army." This person wears a cotton cloth gray military uniform, cloth shoes, and is plainly dressed, not smiling, and speaks in a deep and solemn tone. The Communist Party's atmosphere seems to be stronger. He also has a bit of the "Guangxi" hometown flavor. When the reporter was talking with Wei Guoqing, a young man sitting next to him held a notebook and recorded our conversation at a very fast speed. It is said that he is a staff member of the Political Department of the "New Fourth Army." This Communist political work comrade speaks more kindly and affectionately. I am a person who is used to being casual, and when I am placed in such a state, it seems a bit "that way."</p>
<p>Pacification Headquarters Offers Good Meals</p>
<p>The Communist Party representatives and their entourage, more than 20 people in total, live in Xuzhou and are hosted by the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters. Every day, there are four dishes and one soup, white flour steamed buns, and rice. The food is very good. The after-dinner pastime is playing table tennis, and the life interest is quite strong. The government has also specially prepared a car for their transportation when they go out. The Communist soldiers with the "New Fourth Army" and "Eighth Route Army" badges wear uniforms that are similar to those of the National Army, with both grass green and gray packages, but the upper garment is longer, hanging down to the knees. The representatives and entourage are all brand new, obviously specially prepared for "guesting." These Communist soldiers seem to be all intellectuals who have received rigorous training and are courteous in dealing with people. They get along harmoniously with the "Central Military Police." If this point can symbolize the future of the entire relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, we can assert that China will definitely have a solution.</p>
<h3>The Motherland's Giant Eye, Alone Overseas: Hainan Island, Leap Forward!</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Our Correspondent Mu Sheng, Sanya Bay</p>
<p>Hainan Island, along with Taiwan, is known as one of "China's two giant eyes." Since October 17th of last year, when the 46th Army, led by Commander Han Liancheng, with its 188th and 19th New Divisions, began taking over the island in separate directions, everything has progressed smoothly. As of now, all areas have successively been recovered, following the glorious victory of the motherland. If this place is truly the so-called "Shangri-La," then now is the time to "Shangri-La-ize" it. By "Shangri-La-ize," the reporter means the embodiment of reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts. Based on the reporter's week-long investigation, this report provides a comprehensive overview of the various inherent facilities and their current status, which the readers of this newspaper will hopefully find informative.</p>
<p>It is reported that before our officials arrived in Hainan Island to take over, the stubborn and wicked Japanese had secretly transported large quantities of military equipment and supplies to various coastal ports and sunk them there. They also set fire to many textiles. All of these are greatly regrettable. It is unknown whether our authorities will impose appropriate punishments on those Japanese wrongdoers. Otherwise, it seems it would be too lenient on the enemy.</p>
<p>People Endure Hardship, Possess a Strong Drive</p>
<p>Although the people here live in hardship, their spirit of perseverance, diligence, liveliness, and strong drive is unmatched by other regions of the motherland. As long as politics can quickly get on track and various enterprises can gradually resume production, it will not be difficult for this island to become one of the most fertile parts of the motherland, which will radiate an even brighter light on the future of the motherland. In terms of agriculture and forestry, natural forests are everywhere, and good timber is inexhaustible. The uncultivated wasteland is more abundant than the cultivated land. The weather is mild, and even winter is as warm as spring. This area (Sanya Bay) has long been known as the "Region of Perpetual Summer," which is due to its proximity to the equator and warmer weather. The coconut groves in winter often present a scene of spring or autumn. If water conservancy is developed, it would be possible to cultivate three times a year, and there would be a surplus of grain to supplement the deficiency of various regions in Guangdong Province. In regards to the problems of seed selection and fertilization, the Sanya Experimental Farm has already made progress. If this unfinished work is continued, these problems will not be difficult to solve.</p>
<p>Factory Equipment Still in Good Condition</p>
<p>It is gratifying that ready-made materials and daily necessities industries (such as soy sauce and leather) were the first to be taken over and have already been utilized and put into production. The industrial and mining equipment is still in good condition and is expected to be put into operation soon. However, heavy industry, the section of the railway from Sanya to Beili, and the leper hospital with special equipment in Haikou have not yet been taken over. A considerable number of workers are unemployed and starving. If emergency relief is not implemented, not only will these workers be in dire straits, but even local public order may become a serious problem. It is said that our competent authorities have paid close attention to this issue and are carefully considering countermeasures.</p>
<p>Currently, Hainan Island is still stuck on the threshold of a difficult transition period. The society is generally confused, and the business community is also in a state of stagnation. Merchants and residents, because of the current state of chaos, are restless. The most unscrupulous ones consider this to be a good opportunity to fish in troubled waters, fabricating various pretexts and colluding with local special forces to implement their tactics of seizing by force, making it impossible for essential commodities to circulate, so that normal business has no room to stand or develop. Although our government has clearly ordered the exemption of land taxes in all recovered areas for one year, there is still a strange phenomenon here of collecting grain under certain names. After suffering seven years of relentless exploitation by the enemy and puppet regime, is it necessary for the people of Hainan to suffer this avoidable and yet unavoidable devastation?</p>
<p>In terms of industry and mining, Hainan Island is uniquely blessed. Although it lacks coal and has short rivers, making it difficult to build large-scale hydroelectric power plants to supply power, making it difficult to become an independent industrial unit, it has extremely good iron ore. Unfortunately, our country does not currently have such a large-scale iron factory to consume 3 million tons of iron ore per year. It is difficult to expect a resumption of work within two years. However, this important resource will sooner or later become a treasure trove for building a new China.</p>
<p>There are many undertakings that must be utilized in Hainan Island in the future. The main ones can be divided into military undertakings, mining, shipbuilding, waterway transportation, electrical industry, and chemical industry. Militarily, the most important facilities include three well-equipped air force bases, a large-scale naval hospital, a bacteria research laboratory, an oxygen manufacturing plant, and a 180-kilometer-long light rail line (from Yulin to Beili).</p>
<p>Developing Resources, Contributing Greatly</p>
<p>Mineral deposits are an important resource of Hainan Island, with extremely rich reserves and excellent mineral quality. The most important is iron. In the past, the Japanese operated two iron mines: the Tiandu Iron Mine and the Shilu Iron Mine. Most of their equipment is still in good condition and can be utilized immediately.</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter hopes that the authorities can actively utilize the military facilities left behind by the enemy, improve or adjust them, and achieve the goal of consolidating the motherland's naval and air bases. Therefore, at present, no one should be preoccupied with personal gain or petty profits and betray the ardent desire for governance of the 3 million people on the island. Rise up! For national defense, for people's livelihood, quickly establish a foundation that will last for all time! (January 15th)</p>
<h3>Reader Opinions: A Suggestion for Stabilizing Prices</h3>
<p>Editor: The people are still unaware of whether there has been any improvement in the gold policy recently. In fact, no effective measures have been seen. Also, the rumored Sun Yat-sen banknotes are also a sharp weapon to stimulate prices and the value of legal tender. Now everyone is scrambling to buy red gold and materials, and dare not keep legal tender overnight. If the government wants to solve the hidden pain of the poor and maintain social order, it should urgently adopt the following measures:</p>
<p>(1) First of all, the economic policy and the future currency system reform methods must be clearly announced. If there are factors that compete with the people for profit, or are enough to stimulate prices, they should be eliminated immediately. In particular, the people should have considerable faith in the government's protection of legal tender.</p>
<p>(2) The authorities should announce to the people the fact of Sun Yat-sen banknotes and their value compared with legal tender. If the issuance of Sun Yat-sen banknotes will indeed affect the value of legal tender, or the government has no such plan at all, the authorities should make a detailed statement.</p>
<p>(3) The government should immediately release a large amount of gold at a relatively low official price as much as possible. According to the situation in various places, establish a bill to stabilize prices and announce it immediately. If there are any unscrupulous merchants or degenerates hoarding and manipulating, enforce the law strictly. If this can be done, prices will naturally fall. Ye Xigui (February 26th)</p>

<h3>The Destruction of the Franco Regime</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the United Nations, it has continuously exerted pressure on the Franco regime in Spain, believing that the Spanish political situation must be thoroughly reorganized to achieve a democratically elected government, and then Spain can rejoin international politics. Recently, Franco-French relations have suddenly become strained. The French government has ordered the closure of the Franco-Spanish border, believing that the current situation in Spain is sufficient to "endanger international security" and demanding the overthrow of the Franco regime. The Franco-Spanish border is thus fraught with tension, and the pressure exerted by the great powers on the Franco regime has also increased. After receiving the French government's request to sever relations with the Franco regime, the American government consulted with the British and French governments. Although the content of the consultation has not been released, diplomatic sources claim that the United States is proposing that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France declare their disapproval of Franco and express their dissatisfaction with the continued existence of the Franco government. The United States, Britain, and France are also planning to issue a joint statement demanding an end to the Franco regime. How the Franco regime will cope with the situation and how the Spanish people will react to the pressure exerted on Franco by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France remains to be proven by subsequent developments. It seems that we cannot help but say a word about the development of the Spanish situation, because it contains a very important principle in international relations. How this principle will be encountered in future international relations not only concerns the independent survival of all nations, but also concerns the safety of the world.</p>
<p>What we want to state first is that we not only have no goodwill towards the Franco regime, but also have considerable hostility. The Franco regime's flattery of the Axis powers and its recognition of the puppet regimes that appeared in China is something that the Chinese people will never forgive. From the standpoint of the nation, we not only sympathize with but also support the attitude and measures taken by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France towards the Franco regime. But if we look at the measures taken by the great powers against the Franco regime from another perspective, we are very worried that a very important principle in international relations will be abandoned. What is this principle? This is non-interference in internal affairs. It is remembered that the Atlantic Charter made a promise of non-interference in internal affairs. In fact, the pressure exerted by the great powers on Franco securities is no different from interfering in internal affairs. The Franco regime is the only stable regime in Spain at present. Whether from a moral or legal point of view, it seems that the great powers cannot put international pressure on this only stable regime in Spain to make it collapse. The democratic movement must be internal. The overthrow of the Franco regime must be initiated by the Spanish people themselves. If a regime is intolerable to the great powers and is destroyed by pressure exerted by the great powers, if this principle is recognized, then the nations will no longer have independent and autonomous survival. This will be a dangerous precedent in future international relations.</p>
<p>The London Daily Times recently wrote an article to maintain the principle of non-interference in internal affairs and pointed out the Spanish situation, saying: "Few people in Britain during the war and now would support Franco's policies, but his behavior cannot be considered sufficient to 'endanger international security'. In fact, Spain, in its current isolated situation, cannot pose a threat to anyone. Under these circumstances, the demand for joint action against Franco is undoubtedly to divert the world's attention from the many serious and undecided issues facing the United Nations. This diversion is not necessary. The Spanish people will be dissatisfied with foreign interference in their internal affairs. This is enough to make the Spanish people support Franco instead of attacking him. The result of this interference in internal affairs will be endless. Britain must consider carefully before taking action, because this action may damage the principle of non-interference and the dignity of the law. It was to protect these principles that Britain joined the 1939 war. Even today, Britain wants to see its effectiveness in Eastern Europe, although its success is not necessarily consistent." In today's world, the London Daily Times is able to specifically put forward the principle of non-interference and the inviolability of the dignity of the law. The Times has its original intentions, but it coincides with what we see.</p>
<p>In short, we have no love for the Franco regime. From the standpoint of the nation, we would like to see it collapse sooner rather than later. However, if we use international pressure to force it to collapse, we ultimately feel that it damages the principle of non-interference in internal affairs and the dignity of the law. If future international relations are to be built on the basis of the rule of law, damage to the dignity of the law will be a regrettable precedent.</p>

<h3>Uneven Distribution of Daily Necessities Controlled by Industry Associations: Violates Original Intention of Price Stabilization; 351 Tobacco Retailers Request Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from This Paper] 351 tobacco retailers from this city have jointly requested a thorough investigation into the unfair distribution of daily necessities such as low-priced soap sold by the Handling Bureau. They claim that the distribution is controlled by a small number of people, and most retailers do not receive their share. Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, dozens of representatives went to the Municipal Government to see Mayor Qian and submitted a joint petition for a thorough investigation. According to the representatives, there are approximately 10,000 tobacco retailers in this city. The low-priced goods, such as soap and matches, sold by the Handling Bureau on several occasions have been distributed to only 700 or so tobacco retailers who have special relationships with the industry association and then sold on the black market. The majority of retailers are unable to get their hands on these goods, which is a serious violation of the original intention of stabilizing prices. It was also said that the Handling Bureau has sold low-priced soap five times, totaling more than 400,000 cases. The official price for the first sale of low-priced soap was 9,500 yuan per case, while it was sold on the black market for 18,000 yuan. For the most recent fifth sale, the official price was 20,000 yuan, while it was 28,000 yuan on the black market. Because the low-priced goods are controlled by a small number of retailers and flow into the black market, the citizens have not benefited. At the same time, this reporter also visited the person in charge of the industry association, who said that there are only more than 4,000 retailers in the association. According to the size of the business, they are divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D. Retailers of grades A and B have already received low-priced goods. Because there are more stores of grades C and D and they cannot quickly raise funds, the Handling Bureau is afraid that the distribution procedures will be too troublesome, so they have not distributed to them. The association is currently submitting a document to apply. As for the sale of low-priced goods on the black market, he hopes that retailers will supervise and report each other.</p>
<h3>Brave Police Chief Dies in Line of Duty While Arresting Two Thieves; Shot in the Leg and Stabbed More Than Ten Times in the Head</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday afternoon at 5:30 PM, a rural household in a village in the north of Longhua Town was suddenly robbed by bandits. As the thieves fled toward the highway, the victim followed closely and shouted "Robbers!"</p>
<p>At that time, a police chief with badge number 8601 from the Longhua Branch, accompanied by two policemen, was returning to the station on official duty. Upon hearing the cries of "Robbers!", he bravely rushed forward. He saw four bandits rushing towards him. The police chief took a step forward and captured two bandits on the spot. He then handed them over to the policemen to guard. The remaining bandits fled into the darkness. The police chief took a step forward and gave chase. One bandit was finally grabbed by the waist. Unexpectedly, the bandit had a firearm and fired three shots, all hitting the police chief in the left leg. However, the injured police chief still held on tightly to the bandit. Another bandit immediately took out a sharp blade and stabbed him in the head, totaling more than eleven wounds. The police chief, due to his severe injuries, collapsed. The two bandits took the opportunity to escape. Before long, a rice truck passed by. At the request of the remaining policemen, they helped the wounded police chief, who was barely breathing, onto the truck, intending to send him to the police hospital for treatment. However, due to excessive blood loss, he died when he arrived at the entrance of the Taishan Branch.</p>
<h3>Factories Damaged During the War Seek Reparations from the Enemy</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factory Association believes that the damages suffered by factories during the War of Resistance were extremely serious. They have prepared two investigation forms, which have been distributed to all members to fill out and submit to the Social Affairs Bureau for reporting to the central government and seeking reparations from the enemy. It is now learned that the Social Affairs Bureau issued an order to the association yesterday, approving the collection of reported losses.</p>
<p>Hu Xiyuan, the standing committee member of the Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factory Association, said that before the War of Resistance, the association served national goods factories and achieved remarkable results. During the War of Resistance, it was unable to operate and temporarily ceased operations. Now that light has returned, the national goods factories are starting to resume production, so the association has also been reinstated, and a new office has been set up at No. 13, Lane 525, Minquan Road. New and old members are welcome to contact them there.</p>

<h3>Exchange Rate Implementation Liberalized, Market Responds Well: Implementation of Liberalization</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Announcement of US Dollar Telegraphic Transfer Rate of 2020 Yuan; Foreign Currency Sources Arriving Continuously, Prices Will Gradually Fall</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The foreign exchange market, which has attracted much attention, was officially opened yesterday morning at 10 AM, after the Central Bank announced the telegraphic transfer rate for the US dollar that day at 2020 yuan. The telegraphic transfer rate did not fluctuate throughout the day. All 27 designated banks and approved foreign exchange brokers referred to the rate set by the Central Bank. Since the foreign exchange market was just opened, they felt unfamiliar with the various buying and selling procedures stipulated by the Central Bank. Moreover, the telephones for communication between the brokers and the designated banks were not yet fully installed, so the transaction was very sluggish throughout the day, and the exchange market remained stable. In the meantime, before the foreign exchange rate was determined, the Bank of China had accepted mortgage loans from various exporters, and the exchange rate was temporarily calculated at 1,000 yuan. Yesterday, the various exporters went to settle the exchange rate difference of the mortgage loan. The Bank of China settled it at an exchange rate of 1,930 yuan. As for the buying and selling of forward foreign exchange, it has not yet started.</p>
<p>Designated Banks Hold First Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>This reporter visited Mr. Lin Weiying, the director of the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank, last night. He said that the market responded very well after the Central Bank opened the foreign exchange market and announced the telegraphic transfer rate for the US dollar that day. The market was calm throughout the day. The Central Bank will have printed all kinds of application forms today. Yesterday, more than ten type A approved business firms applied to the Central Bank, and one type B approved business firm, China Travel Service, applied to the Central Bank. It is also learned that the 27 designated banks held their first meeting yesterday afternoon under the convening of the Bank of China. During the meeting, there was a detailed discussion on the formation of a trade association of designated foreign exchange banks and the future development and connection of business.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Brokers Association Established</p>
<p>The 16 approved foreign exchange brokers also established the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Brokers Trade Association at No. 9, Museum Road yesterday. All 16 members attended. Guo Baoshu, Wen Dehua, Wei Boxiang, Dong Xuanheng, and Clark were elected as committee members, with Guo Baoshu as the full-time committee member and Wen Dehua as the deputy director committee member.</p>
<p>People's Hearts are Extremely Stable, and the Future is Extremely Optimistic</p>
<p>According to Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, after the opening of foreign exchange, the business community in this city believes that foreign goods can be transported to China in a continuous stream, so people's hearts are extremely stable and optimistic about the future. It is expected that the prices in this city will gradually fall from stability.</p>
<p>Applications Required for the Import of Reserved Luxuries</p>
<p>The "Temporary Measures for Import and Export Trade" promulgated by the government stipulate that various luxury goods are prohibited items in the third category. Importers in this city believe that the luxury goods ordered from foreign countries before the promulgation of these measures are very large in quantity, or have already been shipped, or have been contracted to cannot be returned, and are all extremely anxious. This reporter inquired with the Jianghai Customs yesterday and was told that if the prohibited items were ordered before March 1, they must be applied to the Customs within 10 days and can be imported only after obtaining approval. Applications must also be submitted for the approval of prohibited export items if they were ordered by foreign merchants before March 1, before they can be exported.</p>
<h3>Difficulties in Water Transport in the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River Increasing Daily</h3>
<p>The water level in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River is low, which is rare compared with previous years. According to the shipping industry, the Xuanjiang report at the end of last month reported the lowest water level was nine feet below zero, making navigation more difficult. Minfu and Minlai, two ships of the Minsheng Company, sailed from Yishang at the end of last month. When passing through Qingjiang, the Qingjiang was broken, making it impossible to pass. In order to avoid danger, they have returned to Yichang. According to the shipping industry, if the water level does not rise again, it is feared that ships will not be able to sail directly to Yichang. The transportation between Yu and Yi must be divided into two sections, namely, Yuwan section and Wanyi section, so the entire Yangtze River will be divided into four sections. Also, according to news, there were a total of 20 ships sailing from Yudong downstream in February. Except for two or three that have sailed to Jinghan, the rest have all sailed to Yichang. A total of more than 6,140 passengers and 860 tons of cargo were transported, which is the lowest transportation volume since the restoration. The reason is actually due to water logging.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Iron Gate Closed; 1,500 Workers Conduct Work-to-Rule Yesterday; Six Demands Previously Made Without Reply or Solution; Labor Side Unable to Agree</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Over 1,500 workers from the Jianghai Customs on the Bund and the Taxation Bureau on Hart Road began a work-to-rule campaign starting at 2:00 PM yesterday. The iron gates of the Jianghai Customs were tightly shut, and pickets were stationed to prevent unauthorized entry and exit. Although customs officials did not participate, the work-to-rule by workers in the communications department, telephone room, and other areas, along with the shutting off of the main power switch for the lights, made it impossible for officials to work, thus paralyzing the entire customs organization. According to labor representatives, a work-to-rule action occurred on the 23rd of last month due to demands for improved treatment, and six conditions were proposed. At that time, Vice Chief Inspector Ding resolved the matter by temporarily lending each worker two months' salary, with future salaries to be adjusted in line with the cost of living. A response was promised within a week. As the deadline has passed without a reply, a work-to-rule action was implemented. Customs authorities stated that after the work-to-rule incident last month, Chief Secretary Li Du specially flew to Chongqing to seek instructions from the Executive Yuan. Coincidentally, President Song visited Shanghai, and he has been preoccupied with the opening of foreign exchange, leaving him with no time to address the matter. However, the customs authorities had promised a response by this morning, making the workers' work-to-rule action regrettable. At 4:00 PM yesterday, the authorities proposed a solution: before a formal salary adjustment, workers would receive a temporary payment of 84,000 yuan for skilled workers and 68,500 yuan for ordinary workers. However, the workers did not agree to this proposal, and the work-to-rule action continues.</p>
<p>Court Civil Servants Submit Application</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] All civil servants of the Shanghai District Court, to secure a stable livelihood, jointly submitted an application requesting a salary increase. Representatives elected by them, including Judge Cao Zuwei and six others, held a small group meeting yesterday and submitted the application to President Cha Liangjian. The reported demands include a monthly salary of 200,000 yuan for judges, 150,000 yuan for secretaries and translators, and a minimum salary of 80,000 yuan. If a satisfactory resolution is not reached, the entire court intends to cease operations starting on the 15th.</p>
<p>Labor Dispute at Jingchang Factory Resolved Yesterday</p>
<p>(1) Over 120 workers at the Jingchang Dyeing and Weaving Factory on Binlang Road, who had been conducting a work-to-rule action since the 25th of last month to demand improved treatment, completely resolved their dispute yesterday through mediation by the General Labor Union and have fully resumed work. (2) Over 500 workers at the Zhenzhong Dyeing and Weaving Factory at 841 Xikang Road, who had put forward fifteen demands for improved treatment, were persuaded by representatives from the General Labor Union and resumed work at 4:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>Typesetting Industry Workers Find It Difficult to Sustain a Living</p>
<p>Workers in the city's typesetting industry have presented four demands for improved treatment to employers, requesting their acceptance. The Social Affairs Bureau has scheduled a meeting for today to convene representatives from both sides for mediation.</p>
<h3>Automobile Injures Pedestrian</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] A small automobile from the Municipal Police Bureau, while traveling near the Taishan Branch Office on Linsen Road at 7:30 PM last night, collided head-on with a rickshaw puller. The passenger, Wang Honglin, a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine, suffered a head injury and is in serious condition.</p>
<h3>Prisoner Wu Jiangleng, Accused of Murder, Claims to be a Political Prisoner</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Since the government decided to release political prisoners, all parties have expressed great concern. This reporter has learned from the Shanghai Prison at Tilanqiao that there are currently no political prisoners detained there. Those arrested during the enemy puppet regime for patriotic activities were released on bail in August and September of last year. Yang Zhizhong and six others, who have been appealing to the press in recent days claiming to be political prisoners, were arrested by the puppet Security Command. After interrogation by the High Procuratorate, they were transferred to the Songhu Garrison Command, which took over that department, on February 23. They claim to have been on a hunger strike for five days, demanding to be released under the political prisoner amnesty, but in reality, they reduced their food intake. If they had truly been on a hunger strike for five days, they would have starved to death long ago. Currently, only Wu Jiangleng in the prison claims to be a political prisoner, but he is accused of murder, so the High Court still treats him as an ordinary criminal.</p>
<h3>Japanese War Criminal Ishihara Isamu Tried by US Military Tribunal</h3>
<p>Serving as Chief Translator, Committing Many Evils</p>
<p>The US War Crimes Tribunal yesterday tried Japanese war criminal Ishihara Isamu. During the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, he served as the chief translator at the Wusong and Jiangwan concentration camps, acting as a lackey of the aggressors. He treated the 1,200 American prisoners of war in the camps harshly, inflicting beatings, whippings, waterboarding, and other cruel tortures. After the Japanese surrender, he was charged by the US side. Ishihara Isamu is 36 years old and studied in Hawaii in his youth. He has lived in China for ten years and is fluent in Chinese and English in addition to his native Japanese. The US military has accused him of seven counts of abusing prisoners of war, specifically Sergeant Minack, Sergeant Skurka, Sergeant Stout, Sergeant Stewarts, Sergeant Beets, and Americans Gatto and Linau.</p>
<p>Opening Court Session Reads Indictment</p>
<p>The court session opened at 9:00 AM, with Trial Officer Captain Middleton and Colonels Whither, Meeshaw, Svenson, and Georgiason serving as judges. The plaintiffs' prosecutors were Captain Galante and Major Osborne, and the defendant's defenders were Major Lewin and Major Dona. The plaintiffs' prosecutors began by reading the indictment. The defendant's defense attorney requested the dismissal of the case on the grounds that the United States had no right to establish a court in China. The presiding judge opposed the request, stating that China had not objected to the matter, and a formal trial was scheduled for the afternoon.</p>
<p>Afternoon Session Continues with Witness Testimony</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Yazawa Toshihiko was called to testify. He had worked at both the Wusong and Jiangwan camps and witnessed Ishihara Isamu abusing prisoners of war. At the time, most of the prisoners of war were members of the US Marine Corps or employees of American consulates in various locations. Ishihara Isamu resorted to vicious tactics to extort money from the prisoners. The witness claimed: "My parents taught me not to lie, so my testimony today is entirely truthful." However, Yazawa Toshihiko also stated that Ishihara Isamu was impartial, regarded laws and military discipline as unyielding, and, while he abused prisoners of war, also considered the welfare of the prisoners in the camp. He even invited clergymen to the camp to preach to the prisoners and used his own money to provide milk to the sick. The plaintiff's prosecutor asked: If Ishihara Isamu was so "benevolent," why did he "beat prisoners of war"? The witness replied: "Because he was a law-abiding person." Subsequently, Morosako Ichiki was called to testify. His testimony was similar to that of Yazawa. Both had served as translators at the Jiangwan and Wusong concentration camps and worked with Ishihara Isamu. The case is scheduled to resume at 9:00 AM this morning.</p>
<h3>Recruiting Laborers for the Enemy; Two Traitors Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Shen Anfa Declared Not Guilty</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] In 1943, the Japanese company Yamakyu in this city, commissioned by the enemy naval attache's office, recruited 180 shipbuilding carpenters from Lubandian to work in the Philippines. After the victory, Jiang Yougen, the "Director" of the Zhejiang Hongbang Carpenter's Guild responsible for the matter, and Zuo Ming, the translator for Yamakyu, were reported to the authorities and arrested. Carpenter Shen Anfa was also implicated. After several trials, the High Court at Tilanqiao announced the verdict yesterday afternoon: Jiang Yougen and Zuo Ming, jointly conspiring with the enemy to recruit military laborers, are sentenced to life imprisonment, and their civil rights are revoked for life. All property, except for the necessary living expenses for their families, will be confiscated. Shen Anfa is found not guilty. If the defendants have any objections, they may apply for a retrial within ten days of receiving the written judgment.</p>
<h3>Chinese Merchants' Electricity Company Incurs Significant Losses After the War</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] This city's electricity industry has suffered greatly during the eight years of war. Currently, all are under control, but crises are lurking. In the past, due to excessively low electricity prices, electricity theft, and high operating expenses, all Chinese merchant companies have incurred significant losses and are unable to sustain themselves. Therefore, they have specifically questioned the municipal government: (1) Approve a reasonable increase in electricity prices to achieve a balanced budget. (2) The Nanshi and Pudong companies should negotiate with the Shanghai Electric Power Company to connect electricity directly through the former French Concession and the Huangpu River to avoid roundabout routes and power loss. (3) The repairs of the Zhabei Pudong Chinese Merchant Water and Electricity Company should be assisted by the Relief Administration, etc. The Four Allied Relief Organizations should also provide large loans to restore power generation as soon as possible. (4) Urge all electrical companies in the city to cooperate, coordinate the actual needs for the next few years, and start expanding power generation facilities to prevent future problems.</p>
<h3>Tap Water Tastes Salty; Safe to Drink</h3>
<p>Caused by High Tides</p>
<p>Recently, the tap water in the city has had a salty taste, which is caused by high tides, low river water levels, and seawater flowing back into the river. According to the records of the Municipal Public Utility Bureau, this phenomenon usually occurs every year between January and March. Although this salty taste is inconvenient for the city's residents to drink, it does not affect their health.</p>
<h3>Dance Schools Renamed Dance Arts Training Centers</h3>
<p>Six Regulations Formulated</p>

Despite assistance from the company's military police to persuade them, there was no resolution as of last night.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Xinjiang Road in the Early Morning</h3>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Eagerly Awaited by All Parties; Foreign Exchange Market Opens; Futures Trading Temporarily Not Conducted</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of the foreign exchange market opening. The Central Bank stipulated that trading hours would be from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. On Wednesdays and Saturdays, only morning sessions would be held, and afternoon sessions would be suspended. Yesterday was Monday, and the Foreign Exchange Department of the Central Business Bureau followed the regulations and announced the US dollar telegraphic transfer rate at 2,020 yuan. This price was immediately notified to the sixteen foreign exchange brokers and twenty-seven designated banks. Futures trading was temporarily not conducted. The exchange rate for British pounds was also not determined but could be calculated from the US dollar exchange rate. This price is not fixed and will be adjusted at any time based on market supply and demand. Designated banks can also make changes based on the size of their positions and the volume of transactions. Yesterday, transactions did not take place because application forms for settling foreign exchange had not yet been printed. It is also reported that for foreign exchange settlements, the imported goods must first be approved by the customs authorities, and then the designated bank will handle the matter on their behalf. If selling, the amount of foreign exchange must first be settled with the bank, and then the export goods must be presented to customs for inspection. All transactions must be for normal trade. For small amounts and living expenses for overseas personnel, sales and purchases can be made with the bank by stating the reasons and providing sufficient proof. As for gold trading, it is handled in the same way as the US dollar according to central regulations, but it was not officially announced yesterday.</p>
<h3>Silver Shops' Actual Sales Resume Brisk; Gold Price Rises Compared to Previous</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the large number of small shops and silver shops exchanging gold, gold ornaments were priced up to 167,000. Trading was remarkably lively, with Shengkai opening at 1,520,000 for purchases. Silver shop gangs competed to bid up, once raising the price to the 1,600,000 mark. Securities gangs sold on hearing the news, causing the price to fall to 1,480,000. At this point, buyers and sellers waited quietly for changes. The foreign exchange listing was revealed, hovering around the 1,500,000 mark, then fell to 1,440,000. At noon, it struggled at 1,480,000. In the afternoon, silver shop sales resumed briskly, and the price rebounded to above 1,500,000. As a result, it rose slightly by 30,000 compared to last week. Gold ornaments were priced at 164,000, tael silver at 1,800, and silver dollars stopped falling and started to rise, attracting some speculative funds, rising by 50 yuan.

<h3>Some Speculative Funds Active; New Harbor Bonds Rise Again; US Dollars Rebound by 30 Yuan</h3>
<p>Foreign currency US dollars were stimulated by the foreign exchange market. There were buyers at 1,980 yuan at the opening in the morning, and the price once rose above 2,050 yuan.

Later, it decreased by 20 yuan and settled at around 1,960 yuan. In the afternoon, the gold price rebounded, and the US dollar hovered around the 2,000 yuan mark. As a result, it rebounded by 30 yuan compared to last Saturday. Some speculative funds concentrated on new bonds, rising from 80 yuan to above 90 yuan, resulting in a gain of 10 yuan for 1936 bonds compared to last Saturday. Although 1937 bonds also gained 10 yuan, their base was looser than 1936 bonds.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Fluctuate; Subsidized Vegetable Oil Planned</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market was weak in the morning and firm in the afternoon. Early southern japonica rice, bojin early rice, and sheep-tail indica rice did not fluctuate, but baiyuan rice was in short supply and traded actively, rising by 1,000 yuan. Northern japonica rice was slow to move, with prices down slightly by 300-500 yuan. Flour was unchanged. Soybean cake traded fairly and returned slightly by 100-200 yuan. Yellow soybeans were tight, rising by 300-500 yuan. Bean curd skin turned firm, and raw peanuts were strong. The oil market rose by more than 1,000 yuan, with the closing price flat. One ship of foreign wheat is expected to arrive within days, approximately 4,000-5,000 tons. The Relief Administration will contract Maoxin Flour Factory to produce flour for local beneficiaries. The foreign wheat stored in various factories in Shanghai is being processed into flour day and night. To date, the Relief Administration has sold no less than 500,000 bags of subsidized flour, so the city's flour users are well-supplied. It is reported that large quantities of subsidized oil will be put on sale soon and is currently being planned.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Transactions Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn and cloth market was relatively stable. Although customer purchases were not very active, sporadic transactions were very lively. 20-count horse brand yarn rose again to 1,080,000, and small-scale 20-count yarn was around 900,000, with a stable trend and improved sentiment. Fangjian Company sold yarn in the morning and added the sale of cotton cloth in the afternoon, totaling sixteen types. It is reported that local cloth is about 10% cheaper than market prices.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market was still active. Fangjian Company handled 200 bales of Mitlin cotton at 82,000 yuan and imported 200 bales of Brazilian cotton at 78,000 yuan. Private yarn factories imported San Yu Zhen cotton at 83,000 yuan and Huoxuan cotton at 75,000 yuan. The prices are all factory prices. Zhouchuan cotton has not opened yet, and market prices are similar to the previous week.</p>
<h3>Silk Fabric Factory Yarn Transactions Sparse, Prices High; Silk Market Weak; Artificial Silk Also Turns Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the artificial silk market started firm but then weakened. The cash price of 120-count Sky Bridge artificial silk opened at 1,910,000 yuan, then declined and closed at 1,820,000 yuan.

Minsheng brocade satin was at 17,000 yuan per piece.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou Black Tea Prices Fall Again</h3>
<p>Wenzhou black tea is abundant in the market today. Customers are continuously selling, so the price support is weak. As a result, the price per dan is down by 2,000 yuan compared to last week. Other grades remain stable, but the market varies depending on the quality of the goods, so there are mixed results compared to the previous period. In reality, there is a hidden trend of setting prices. As for foreign firms, they are still paying attention, especially since South America is in urgent need of goods. It is reported that some tea factories in the city plan to resume production soon.</p>
<h3>Credit Tightens, Bulls Exit, Securities Fall Across the Board</h3>
<p>Government bonds started stable yesterday but then weakened. Trading was not active. As a result, Categories A and B fell slightly by 50 yuan, Category C and D fell by 80 yuan, and Category E fell by 120 yuan. This was due to the impact of the stock market falling. The process was very ordinary. After the bulls' formation collapsed last Saturday, shares became scarce in the market. The gold price stimulated the market slightly. Yongsheng Yarn and America Asia were initially similar to last Saturday's prices. Jingfu was higher than last Saturday. Afterwards, yarn factories decided to sell after buying, resulting in a collapse. Credit tightened, and many parties sold off, lacking support. Near noon, most closed at low prices. Compared to the previous close, Yongsheng Yarn fell by 250 yuan, America Asia by 180 yuan, and Jingfu by 2 yuan. In the afternoon, overseas shares were also affected by the stock price, falling by 5-10%.</p>
<h3>Burned Alkali Order Arrives; Indanthrene Dye Prices Too High</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The price of burned alkali once plummeted at the beginning of last winter. Afterwards, due to supply shortages and increasing demand, it gradually rose, recently reaching 1.1 million, similar to the highest price at the beginning of last winter. Now it is reported that an order from Brunner Mond &amp; Co. has arrived and will be opened for sale soon. It is noted that this order was placed before the Sino-Japanese War, with an order value of over 40,000 yuan. Adding taxes and water transport costs, the amount is also limited, so the market price of burned alkali is expected to be stabilized.</p>
<p>Since De Fu Foreign Firm dispatched a batch of dyes before the war, no further shipments have been made. Later, the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association applied to the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau to relax the allocation quota and suggested that allocations should be based on the production capacity of each factory, rather than solely on the amount of grey cloth in stock. Although this was agreed to, the second batch of goods recently released is still small in quantity, and the price has risen rapidly. For example, the first batch of Indanthrene dye was allocated at nearly 3 million yuan per dan (unit of weight), but this time it has soared to a massive 16.2 million yuan. The Dyeing and Weaving Association is currently requesting a reduction in the allocation price.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Adjusts Elementary Education Titles in Recovered Areas; Publicly Established Schools Named National Schools; Privately Run Schools Can Only Be Named Elementary Schools</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing] Regarding elementary education in the recovered areas nationwide, the Ministry of Education will first restore existing schools. Secondly, in accordance with the National Education Law, all elementary schools must be renamed National Schools and Central National Schools. In provinces and counties, Central National Schools will be established in townships and National Schools will be established in villages, depending on local conditions. In cities, Central National Schools will be established by district, and National Schools will be established by village. During this winter vacation, Nanjing City has already renamed municipal elementary schools as Central National Schools and National Schools. It is reported that National Schools established by the government in accordance with the National Education Law include both children's and adult departments (adult education belongs to the adult department). Although some National Schools only run children's departments and do not have adult departments, privately run schools can only establish children's departments, called elementary schools, and cannot establish National Schools with village-run adult education departments.

<h3>Principles for Returning Overseas Chinese Students to Resume Studies</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Dagong News Agency, Chongqing] Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, remittances from Southeast Asia have been cut off, and overseas Chinese students studying in China have faced financial hardship. The government has provided assistance in terms of clothing, food, housing, transportation, and education to enable them to continue their studies. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has formulated three principles for the repatriation of overseas Chinese students to resume their studies: (1) Once overseas remittances are restored, all forms of assistance will be discontinued. However, those who experience changes in family circumstances or temporary difficulties will continue to receive assistance as appropriate to enable them to complete their studies. (2) Overseas Chinese students studying in secondary or higher schools should continue to complete their studies and return to their original schools. Those who must return to their original place of residence should provide valid documents and register with the Commission to be repatriated as general returning overseas Chinese. (3) Overseas Chinese students who have graduated from colleges or universities should return to their original place of residence to serve if possible and may request the Commission to provide assistance. It is reported that the specific measures have been sent by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to the Ministry of Education for distribution to provincial and municipal education authorities for compliance.</p>
<h3>Student Diplomas Must Be Signed by the Current Principal</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education Circular to Provincial and Municipal Education Bureaus [Dispatch from Dahua News Agency, Chongqing] The Ministry of Education recently noted that student diplomas from various secondary schools are often issued with the signature of a former principal, while still listing the students' original graduation dates. Furthermore, replacement diplomas requested for lost original diplomas also sometimes list the name of the former principal and the student's original graduation date, all of which is inappropriate and should be corrected. It specifically notified provincial and municipal education bureaus that, in the future, regardless of whether the current principal is creating diplomas for former graduates or issuing replacement diplomas due to lost original diplomas, the current principal must sign the diploma, listing the actual date of creation or replacement, while also noting the original graduation date and the reason for the replacement to reflect the actual situation and avoid misunderstandings.</p>

<h3>Glimpses of National Yingshi University, the Wartime Cultural Cradle of Zhejiang (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Huang Lan</p>
<p>National Yingshi University, this may still be an unfamiliar name to people in the recovered areas. This is because its history is too short, and because its wandering and displacement during the war were too intense. In fact, after the fall of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou and the relocation of Zhejiang University to Guizhou, it was the only complete university in Zhejiang. For seven years, it has been hidden in the mountains and distributed in small towns, providing opportunities for young people with aspirations to continue their studies, and also cultivating many new talents for the motherland seeking a new life from suffering. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, and under the extensive needs of post-war construction, there is no doubt that it must shed its old clothes and put on new ones. Here, let me give a comprehensive report on its origin, current situation, and future prospects:</p>
<p>(1) Origin</p>
<p>In the 28th year of the Republic (1939), the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, in order to commemorate the heroic deeds of the revolutionary martyr Chen Yingshi and to remedy the phenomenon of the decline of higher education in the southeast after the cultural center shifted westward at that time, initiated the establishment of "Zhejiang Provincial Yingshi University" in the eastern Zhejiang water area. It established three colleges: Agriculture, Engineering, and Medicine, intending to cultivate practical talents for the country. This is the predecessor of the current Yingshi University. In the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), Mr. Chen Lifu took over as the Minister of Education and believed that Yingshi University needed to be adjusted and expanded. He nationalized it and transferred the entire law school of the Southeast Associated University to Yingshi University. In addition, he separated the College of Engineering and made it independent as "National Beiyang Institute of Technology"; and added five specialized courses to Yingshi University: Administration, Finance, Accounting, Cooperation, and Art. Due to the impact of the war, the school site was moved from Lishui to Yunhe, and then from Yunhe to Ligongsiqian in Taishun. When Mr. Zhu Jiahua took office as the president, he ordered another adjustment of higher education nationwide. The College of Medicine and the two specialized courses of Art of Yingshi University were merged; "National Beiyang Institute of Technology" was reassigned to Yingshi University. This created the situation of three colleges of Law, Agriculture, and Engineering and three other specialized courses a month ago. Later, the War of Resistance was won. The three specialized courses remaining in Yunhe followed the provincial government to Hangzhou, and the Yingshi University headquarters also moved to Wenzhou for the convenience of repatriation. The above is the process of changes in Yingshi University over the past seven years.</p>
<p>(2) School Affairs Overview</p>
<p>Currently, the College of Law has three departments: Law, Political Science, and Economics. The College of Agriculture has three departments: Agronomy, Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine, and Agricultural Economics. The College of Engineering has three departments: Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Civil Engineering, and Chemical Engineering. President Du Zuozhou stated in an interview: A College of Liberal Arts will be added next year, and it is planned to restore the College of Medicine and add a Normal College in the future. Recently, the school's administrative conference passed an important resolution, namely to recommend that the Ministry of Education allow the school to adopt a group system under the department, in order to respond to various post-war needs. The following is the plan for grouping: The Department of Law of the College of Law is divided into two groups: Judicial and Administrative Law (according to the Ministry order), the Department of Political Science is divided into three groups: Theoretical Politics, Administration, and Diplomacy. The Department of Economics is divided into four groups: Public Finance, Finance, Accounting and Politics, and Economics. The Department of Agronomy of the College of Agriculture is divided into three groups: Crops, Agricultural Chemistry, and Plant Diseases and Insect Pests. The Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine is divided into two groups: Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine. The Department of Agricultural Economics is divided into two groups: Agricultural Economics and Agricultural Finance. The College of Engineering and other departments will add departments as appropriate, without separate groups. It is currently preparing a plan to report to the Ministry for review, and it can be implemented as soon as it is approved.</p>

<h3>Return Our Souls!</h3>
<p>— Qiao Zheng</p>
<p>What does victory bring us? Eight years of pain under occupation make us feel sad and depressed. No matter how eloquent someone is, they can't bring back our broken hearts! We only feel empty and lost.</p>
<p>We are a group of pitiful apprentices, just like the students in schools. We are here to learn skills, but we live like slaves. We are like a group of monkeys, and the bosses and managers are like street performers who lead the monkeys. We shed blood and sweat for them, but they reap the benefits. We do things that are worse than what cattle and horses do, and we are still subjected to their scolding and even whipping. And the pocket money we get each month is not enough for them to buy a few packs of cigarettes! Every day we eat only leftovers!</p>
<p>The editorial in the newspaper said it well: "…Education is the foundation of construction, and we should pay attention to education. We agree that 'education first' should be the guiding principle…" During the eight years of war, the multiple sufferings made it difficult for us to breathe. We abandoned our books, left school, and engaged in the apprentice life that was discriminated against, doing things that were not as good as those of cattle and horses. Although we suffered materially, we were spiritually happy. Our hearts were filled with great ideals, hoping that victory would come soon so that we could have the opportunity to return to school and that the fire of light would warm our hearts. Now that victory has come, where is the fire of light? Our hearts are cold, our hopes have become bubbles. How can we not be heartbroken!</p>
<p>We only have obligations and no rights. We are also human beings! We are also raised by our parents, with flesh and blood, heads, eyes, noses, and mouths, but why do we have to live a life like cattle and horses? Why are our souls in the hands of others? We also have reason and emotion. Why should our freedom be controlled by others? We are not a group of "fatalists" who are at the mercy of others. We need to shout: Return our souls! We are also human beings!</p>

<h3>The Use of Time</h3>
<p>— Xiaoshan</p>
<p>Time is our greatest asset and needs to be used well.</p>
<p>Use time to live. Time is originally for living. Wasting time is equal to not wanting to live -- suicide.</p>
<p>Use time to work. The first thing in life is work. Not working is a debt to life.</p>
<p>Use time to love. Life is "mutual", and you can never reach the end alone. Having many friends is a supreme honor.</p>
<p>Use time to think. Thought produces power, it will issue orders to you, and it will also issue orders to mankind.</p>
<p>Use time to play. Playing with the elderly, you will gain wisdom from their white hair; playing with children, children will wash away your hypocrisy; playing with young people, young people are fresh manufacturers.</p>

<h3>An Account That Cannot Be Settled</h3>
<p>— Xu Yuqing</p>
<p>In pre-war and post-war debt relationships, if a lawsuit arises, the goals of both the plaintiff and the defendant are bound to be completely different, far apart, and the reasons of both sides are bound to be each saying they have a point, each with its own reason. If the country does not promulgate appropriate new laws, then the judicial officer will be very troubled, and both sides will feel that the judgment is unfair. Therefore, I advise creditors and debtors to not get involved in litigation. The following "account that cannot be settled" is a perfect example.</p>
<p>I have an acquaintance, an old woman, who deposited 1,000 yuan in legal tender in a rice shop in the year the War of Resistance began (autumn of the 26th year of the Republic, 1937). The interest rate was of course very low. The principal and interest were not withdrawn for several years. Later, that place was occupied, and the old woman retreated into the free area. She simply put this deposit out of her mind. After the fall of that area, because the puppet currency was in circulation, and two yuan of legal tender were only worth one yuan of puppet currency, all deposits and debts were settled and converted into puppet currency. Of course, the 1,000 yuan in legal tender deposited by the old woman, plus five or six hundred yuan in interest over the past two or three years, totaling one thousand five or six hundred yuan, was only worth seven or eight hundred yuan in puppet currency when converted at two to one. Last year, the enemy surrendered, and the old woman returned to her hometown. Because her circumstances were far worse than before, she sent someone to the rice shop to withdraw the deposit. The person in charge of the rice shop said that although the interest for previous years had been cleared, the interest for this year was still to be calculated and would be delivered tomorrow. After that person left, the accountant calculated that the old woman's deposit, including principal and interest, was less than 2,000 yuan in puppet currency, which was less than 10 yuan in legal tender. After the accountant reported this to the manager, the manager couldn't help but laugh and say, our accounts are based on vouchers and records, converted on time. There is nothing wrong with the logic, but when people deposited it was 1,000 yuan in legal tender, and now, after seven or eight years, the principal and interest together are less than 10 yuan in legal tender. You can say that people deposited 100 yuan in legal tender in our shop for seven or eight years, and we gave them one yuan in legal tender, including principal and interest. This is a big joke. Moreover, this depositor has a considerable relationship with this shop! However, when the accountant asked the manager how to settle the account, the manager just smiled and did not have a satisfactory solution. Finally, the manager instructed the accountant to extract a bill, showing a balance of one thousand several hundred several tens of yuan in puppet currency, and send it to the old woman. The old woman asked someone to carefully read it and explain how the legal tender was converted into puppet currency. When the old woman heard that what she had deposited was less than 10 yuan in legal tender, she immediately tore up the bill. She said that when I deposited 1,000 yuan in legal tender, the price of rice was only 9 yuan per stone, and 1,000 yuan in legal tender could buy more than 110 stones of rice. What is the use of 10 yuan now? I am poor now, what do I need it for?</p>
<p>This account that could not be settled was finally resolved by the rice shop manager giving the old woman three stones of rice, which was considered to have cleared the deposit, because both sides had emotional connections. However, the old woman was still saying behind her back, I am really unlucky, more than 110 stones of rice, deposited for seven or eight years, now only three stones are left. At the same time, the rice shop manager was also saying that the current price of rice is 5,000 yuan per stone (at that time the government stipulated that the price of rice was 5,000 yuan and the market price was about the same), three stones of rice totaled 15,000 yuan in legal tender, equivalent to 3 million yuan in puppet currency. A deposit of less than 2,000 yuan was repaid with 3 million yuan, an average of 1,500 yuan repaid for every one yuan deposited. It is really unspeakable suffering!</p>
<p>In such a peaceful resolution, the arguments of both sides are still clinging to their own views. If a lawsuit were to arise, how could both sides be satisfied?</p>

<h3>Water Transportation in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Yi Ming</p>
<p>Water conservancy, in addition to providing irrigation for fields, also occupies an important position in transportation. Just speaking of Shanghai, land transportation is very developed and can be considered the central hub of land routes in the Jiangnan area. However, what about waterways? Apart from ocean routes, there isn't much to praise. For example, the Suzhou Creek was originally the central hub of inland water transportation in Shanghai, flowing downstream to the Huangpu River and upstream to Suzhou. Unfortunately, the current Suzhou Creek is terribly polluted and blocked. Every day, except during high tide, the river surface suddenly becomes very narrow, making it difficult for ships to navigate. Although this is a minor matter, the impact of an ordinary issue on Shanghai's transportation and commerce cannot be ignored. I believe that to increase Shanghai's commercial prosperity and ensure smooth inland water transportation, the following two points must be noted:</p>
<p>(1) Dredging: When rivers are polluted and blocked, they must be dredged. Otherwise, they will accumulate day by day, the water will become shallow, making it difficult for boats to travel, hindering water transportation, and posing a risk of flooding upstream.</p>
<p>(2) Public Morality: While the pollution and blockage of rivers are often caused by siltation from upstream, it is also due to the public's disregard for public morality. Just looking at the banks of the Suzhou Creek, they are piled with garbage and similar things. This is a major root cause of the pollution and blockage of the Suzhou Creek. Therefore, to prevent the Suzhou Creek from being polluted and blocked, the people must prioritize public morality, and the authorities must also provide supervision and enforcement.</p>

<h3>Collecting Buttons</h3>
<p>— Hong Guang</p>
<p>Today, besides stamp collecting and coin collecting, the third most popular hobby in the United States is button collecting. At the recent third annual meeting of the Los Angeles Button Club, over 200,000 types of buttons were on display, some worth hundreds of US dollars, but no one could estimate the value of the entire exhibition.</p>
<p>The popularity of button collecting has only miraculously risen in the last four years. However, it actually originated from an entertainment festival in 1890, when young girls collected buttons to make a game called "Lover's Knot." While making it, they had to be careful not to string nine hundred and ninety-nine identical buttons on a rope. Legend had it that whoever obtained one thousand identical buttons would remain an old maid forever. This hobby faded away soon after, but today, there are tens of thousands of button collectors throughout the United States. In California, there are junior button clubs specifically for children and young people. These buttons are mostly purchased from secondhand stores or pawnshops. The National Button Society, in order to make this hobby more scientific, has published an eighty-page quarterly magazine, publishing news about new or rare varieties.</p>
