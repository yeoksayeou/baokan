<h3>蘇搬運東北工業設備　美國聲明決不承認　對處置日本在外資產　正與有關各國討論中</h3>
<p>〔美新聞處華盛頓一日電〕發言人今日稱：報戰來自東北之消息，謂蘇聯正在東北搬運所謂「戰爭勝利品」一節，已促使美國向蘇政府聲明美國對此事之關心。該發言人稱：美國約在三星期之前，已開始經由莫斯科美大使館與蘇政府討論，最近則與其他有關係國家之政府開始討論，但未說明何國政府。發言人指出，此種討論並非謂已經獲知蘇聯搬運所謂戰爭勝利品之事，蓋美國對於此事，並未接得直接情報，亦未正式獲悉此事之實際情形。國務院對於此事，發表聲明如下：「吾人與蘇聯政府或任何其他政府，並無關於東北「戰利品」之秘密協定或其他協定，美國政府不承認「戰利品」之解釋爲包括工業或其組織要素，如東北之日本工業與設備等在內。若干時前，吾人曾通知蘇政府，處置日本在外資產，如東北之工業等，係共同利益之問題，凡對於擊敗日本曾負較大負擔之盟國均有關係，在此時期，以此等工業資產作爲「戰利品」，而由東北運走，或以中·蘇兩國對管制此等資產之協定，對日本在東北之國外資產作任何最後之處置，均爲不合之舉，美國政府對於如何處置日本國外資產作爲賠款之問題，最近已與各有關係之政府開始討論」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社北平二日電〕美國務院宣布美國不承認蘇聯在中國東九省攫佔之日方工業設備爲其「戰利品」一節，重慶中國人士均表歡迎，且認此次宣布，可證明美國將就東北中蘇爭端，對蘇聯採取更堅定之政策，故益感振奮。目前此間人士之主要希望，厥爲中國得以不受阻撓，在東北重樹主權，因蔣主席近曾訓令東北行營，示明對蘇談判之原則，乃料凡足以侵犯中國主權之要求，中國均不致接受。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約一日電﹞美戰略局前任局長杜諾芳，昨夜於海外新聞記者俱樂部演說謂，美曾對中國東北之日軍力量估計過高，致使聯合國爲蘇參加對日戰爭，而付予蘇過多之報酬。杜氏稱：而雅爾達會議爲使蘇參加對日戰爭所作對蘇報酬之秘密協定，則係於美方缺乏關於日關東軍之情報窘境中而簽訂者。</p>
<h3>熱烈檢討黨務工作　各委員坦率陳詞　二中全會昨舉行兩次大會</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶二日電〕今天下午三時後，太陽照滿了軍事委員會的大院子，委員們聚精會神，都預備下午要有熱烈的辯論，戴傳賢上了主席台，申明對於黨務報告檢討，要大家發言，每人以五分鐘爲限，沒有一次大會有今天下午言論之坦白澈底，有歷史的意義，眞是谷正綱所說，現在是大家要負起責任，是黨內要拿出民主的精神。這次的會，較前幾次無論那方面都進步得多，發言的各位像黃宇人的慨激，谷正綱的深刻沉重，陳肇英的關心人民的痛苦，胡秋原的發揚政治眞義，陳逸雲代女子呼不平，都予人以深刻的印象。直至燈火齊明，主席乃宣告黨務報告推潘公展，賀衷寒，鄧錫朋等審查。</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶二日電〕六屆二中全會第一次大會，二日上午九時卅分舉行，出席執委于右任，戴傳賢等二百廿六人，監委吳敬恒·王寵惠等八十人，由于委員右任主席，開會如儀後，主席宣告全體肅立，爲全國抗戰陣亡將士及死難同胞默哀致敬，繼由秘書處報告出席人數，宣牘預備會議祀錄及報告委員請假函電後，主席團報告會議日期，議事日程等事項，決議報告畢，委員蕭錚·黃宇人·張厲生·張道藩·周伯敏·苗培成·蕭同茲·程中行·谷正綱·甘乃光·鄭亦同·　魯·戴傳賢·劉廉克·吳國楨·王星卅·白海風等對主席團報告提出意見，討論極爲熱烈，結果主席團決定事項第三項撤銷，第四五兩項由主席團撤回另議，第七項修正通過，十時午王席宣告休息·十五分鐘後，繼續開會，由秘書長吳鐵城作黨務報告，歷時五十五分鐘，　十一時四十分散會。</p>
<p>〔中央重慶二日電〕二中全會二日下午三時廿分舉行第二次大會，傳賢主席，宣布檢討黨　報告，征求各委員發表意見，發言者計十八人，對於木黨優點及缺點曾作極坦率之批評，對於今後改進之方，尤多闡發，其熱烈情形，爲歷屆大會所罕見。至六時概討完畢。王席宣千開始檢討後，首由任卓宜發言，渠即指出軍訓宣傳及民衆運動諸般工作缺點，認爲必須防止官僚主義之侵蝕。李敬齋則謂，本黨須注視民衆之疾苦。谷正鼎主張加强民主作風及黨的領導，且須肅淸黨內游移份子。胡健中謂，應改善工作，因事實即有力宣傳解次各種矛盾。苗培成泛論外交政策，主張公開研究。黃宇人强調黨的革新及團結民主之必要，並質詢六全代會及一中全會次議案之實施情形。吳鐵城主張嚴伸黨紀。羅貢華以三民主義皆未成功，而民權，民生尤待努力。格桑澤仁對邊疆問題提出意見。鄧飛黃以卅年前在靑年時代之限光，對黨作嚴格之檢討。蕭錚要求對黨的制度及人事作　底淸算，以明瞭利弊得失及其責任問題。檢討至此，主席宣告休息十五分鐘，五時編續開會，各委員續有發言，劉成燦述及地方民生疾苦宜速改善。陳肇英報告視察所及，各地同志情緒極爲高漲，至足樂觀，惟各級公務人員待遇菲薄，應予設法解次困難。鄧文儀就黨員成份及軍隊黨員轉移情形加以解釋。胡秋原提出責任觀念及人才主義爲，改進黨務之先次條件。谷正綱就黨的形態，黨的本質，黨的基礎有所中述，並謂救國必先救黨，應以革命精神，反對反革命之勢力。彭昭賢分析目前內外環境，並對黨與政府，黨與黨員，黨與民衆之關係，作坦白之檢討。最後由陳逸雲指出行政院報告之空洞，並抗戰保障女權之未能令人滿意，至此已下午六時，主席宣告停止發言，將黨務報告及各委員意見交付審查，繼即提出黨務審查委員會名單散會。三日上午第三次大會報告受降情形，並作檢討，下午休息。</p>
<h3>孫科因雨滯滬　改定今晨飛渝</h3>
<p>﹝本市訊﹞立法院長孫科自粵抵滬後，原定前日飛渝，出席二中全會，惟日來春雨連綿，致未能成行，如今晨天氣良好，即將格機飛渝。記者昨晨往訪孫院長於寓所，首談關於憲草間題，孫院長稱：民主國家之憲法，應受時間環境之不同而改變。目前五五憲草有多項條文已不合時宜，故有多處需加以增補修正。又如戰前所定法律中，有各地當局所捕人犯必須於二十四小時內移送司法機關辦理一項規定，但至今尚未實行，因有附則之限制，今後當取消該項附則，促其實現。記者詢及東北問題時，孫院長稱：東北所以成爲問題者，乃因國內團結的有問題故也。對於較塲口事件，孫院長不願多談，認此爲丟臉之事。</p>
<h3>湘餘糧徵額　當局准核减</h3>
<p>漢平賣敵僞物資</p>
<p>〔本報漢口二日電〕（一）湘省餘糧徵額，經各方申述困難後，糧政當局已准核减。又湘救濟分署爲使農民復耕，特撥欵億元，購買種子發放各縣，農戶等以災情慘重，春耕尚難進展。（二）此間敵偽物資，次舉辦平賣，由政院特派員會同市商會辦理，日內發售，定月底結束，內多日用品。</p>

<h3>東北問題可望開展　熊式輝等即離渝　張嘉璈將携新方案飛長</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二日電〕重慶訊：此間一般人相信，日前蘇大使彼得羅夫訪晤王外長，對於東北問題之前途，可能有新的發展。又訊：東北行營主任熊式輝，聞日內即自平飛返錦州。又東北行營經委會主委張嘉激氏，日內即將飛赴長春。此行聞携有我政府所擬之新方案，可能在資本及技術方面，予蘇方以相當讓步。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿八日電〕（遲到）張治中稱：蘇聯一定撤兵，且爲期非遠，整軍以外之東北軍事問題，於此次視察華北各地回渝後，可望成立協議。將來軍事調處部將派人員赴東北工作，馬歇爾離渝前，曾有赴瀋陽視察之意，茲因時機未成熟，暫緩前往。</p>
<p>〔本報重慶一日電〕蘇方日前發表蘇眾自東北撤退消息，極爲各方注意，惟官方迄未獲蘇軍撤退之任何報告，又據東北傳來之消息，蘇軍尚無撤退跡象，且新增調部隊分布哈爾濱，旅順，大連各地。又蘇方所宣布之消息，係爲一種宣傳作用，以圖緩和我民衆之愛國情緒，考其居心所在，當爲我全國民衆所認識，據一般觀察，如蘇軍再不撤退，則係破壞中蘇友好條約，一切責任當由蘇方負責，陪都各團體頃督促我政府，嚴重向蘇方交涉撤兵。</p>
<p>〔中央社昆明二日電〕昆市參議會，以東北蘇軍一再延期未撤，今電請國府嚴重交涉，並宣告我國不受雅爾達秘的之約束。</p>

<h3>軍會發言人闢謠</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶二日民〕據軍委會發言人二日發表談話稱：本日新華日報刋截東北三月一日電，妄稱「杜聿明在通遼槍斃中共黨員郭亞臣等廿九人」云云，查該報所傳毫無事實根據，迄今爲止，開人東北國軍僅到達彰武，距離通遼尚有一百四十餘公里，國軍既未開抵通遼，該報誣　杜長官在通遼槍殺中共黨員一節，可不辯自明。政府派赴東北之部隊，均係正式國軍，並無所謂光　部隊，更無先造軍第七師及師長周緒武其人，新華日報不察事實，一意造謠，殊非所宜。</p>

<h3>上海到秦皇島（二）</h3>
<p>— 本報東北特派員　韓淸濤</p>
<p>—隨軍北征海上六日記—</p>
<p>當地特價頗高，白麵三百多元一斤，大米每斗四千六百元，粳米每斗三千六百元（每斗十六斤），豬牛肉四百元一斤，粉條每斤四百至四百六十元，塊煤每噸二萬元，碎煤一萬元，老刀和哈德門都是一百六十元一小盒，其他日用物品，也倍於上海。市面尚通用「僞聯合準備銀行」鈔票，比値是每五元換國幣一元，好多生意人都從此地出關，設法至瀋陽購辦貨物，獲利頗厚，原因是瀋陽物價抵，所以每天北去的火車，十分擁擠，從這裏到天津，更是擠得水洩不通，火車票價甚廉，從秦皇島到天津，僅合國幣四五百元。</p>
<p>在行政劃分上，是　於臨檢縣的一個地方，縣府在秦皇島設有辦事處，人口兩萬多，敎育還長相當的發達，市內有縣立初中一所，內分男女中和小學部，合計千餘人，另有公私立小學六七校，平均各有學生的三百人，各小校已於二十一日開學，縣中因駐軍等關係，二十五日線得開課。</p>
<p>幾位敎育界人士對記者說：「淪陷區的敎育界，在過去的八年裏，受盡了折磨和苦難，在華北方面，除了極少數例外外，都是忍氣呑聲，堅貞自守，對於維繫國家敎育命脈上，貢獻頗大。所有學牛更能專心學業，不事外務，河山光復後，正應有所慰藉之，今天不但不如此，而反以「僞」字加於敎員和學生身上，頗使人憤慨寒心」。</p>
<p>秦皇島的警備，現在新六軍和保安隊等負責，在碼頭上則另有美海軍陸戰隊擔任警務和維持秩序，據聞，其他的幾個北方港口，美海軍也派有陸戰隊，執行臨時警衛。</p>
<p>這次帮助我們運輸新六軍和靑年軍，以及新一軍（新一軍大部，已於二十五日運抵秦皇島，即行北上）等的美國海軍登陸艦，都是屬於七十八和第十四兩個體隊的，由曼尼斯上校指揮，他們也都是參加過硫磺島和菲律賓登陸戰役的名船，好多的還在司令台士，油繪着擊落日機和打沉日艦數目等戰績的記號。</p>
<p>艦上有小砲，機槍，高射機槍等裝備，船頭置有電動啓閉鐵門，以便艙內坦克，戰車，吉普人馬等上下。我們的健兒，就坐息在這長約四十丈許的大艙裏，可由前端大梯走上甲板，大梯也是可以用電力吊起或放下的。船的兩側，各有艙窗，每面配有吊床四一十張，並有廁所，洗澡，醫療等房間，他們讓出了一面，給我們的大小官長，至於船上工作人員衣食起居，則多在船後端。</p>
<p>各船美國工作人員，精神飽滿，工作很負責任，不過因爲習慣上的不同，以及我們一切太貧乏等原因，雙方曾發生了許多不愉快事體，就拿記者第一次所搭乘的第五九六號來說，就可推及一般了。</p>
<p>在第一天上船的時候，艦上堅持要我們健兒卸下槍枝分批捆紮，連同火藥，一槪送入彈藥庫，理由是在前次運輸時，會發生軍火和武器出事的事體，我們竟不能不丟掉「行軍槍不離身」約定例，依照他們規定辦理了。</p>
<p>一個營長隨從背着的新式衝鋒槍，被一個美國水兵奪了去，竟而沒有了踪影，幾經交涉，在換船的時候，僅由船長出一證明：「被其部下收管失落」了事。</p>
<p>此外，在煮飯，廁所，用水以及其他行動上，也發生了許多齷齪，在這期間，都由美軍所派遣船的一個中尉聯絡官，帶着一個中國譯員，代爲傳派雙雙方意見，或代解答問題，因爲運輸國軍北上，是美陸軍當局允代負責的事體，後以飛機不便，乃轉請海軍代辦，所以美陸軍所派聯絡官，不能多作主張，記者所搭登陸艦聯絡官是Graftoa，人很熱心負責。</p>
<p>我們部隊的意見，美國海軍人員和水手，是執行們們上峯命令，協助我們運輸，僅能在技術上帮忙，不能多所干预和指揮我們的行動。又如遇發生事故，以及他們認爲不合的地方，可向我們部隊指揮官交涉商談，不能自作武斷的主張。</p>
<p>此次，記者隨軍上船六天，船行三晝夜，恳想萬千，難以盡述，今願寫些當局有責任，大家也有責任，迫切需要共諜改善和實行的課題：第一，我們行軍飲食太困難，隨時需要　鍋造飯，笨重，費時，汚穢，不經濟，營養不够，所以要採用人家的優點，製造我們適用的行軍糧秣，尤其搭乘火車和船隻的時候有此需要。</p>
<p>其次軍人待遇仍需謀得合理解次辦法，因爲現在又和其他各界人士收入相差太遠了，又軍中設備仍甚貧乏，精神物資，兩感苦悶，這在軍人健康和情緒上，是有很大損失的。</p>
<p>再有一切行動，需要切實實行新生活，行動敏捷，淸潔保持，需要人人澈底做去，此次靑年軍在船上，一般情形尚好，雖然在唾痰和便溺上，船上人員還有不滿，但比起一般好隨地吐痰和到處小便的朋友們，要差强人意了。此外，在上船有時候，青年軍都被打上了減蝨粉又在船上　了一次消毒藥水。</p>
<p>船出吳淞口，很少看到我們船隻，有的，那是江上林立的帆檣，以及海上的孤帆，相反的，來來往往的都是他國船隻，當局和全體同胞，要共同起來，帮助國家建設航海船隻，完全依靠人家是太不行了，太危險了，尤其希望投機家們，不要在操縱物價上兜圈子，眼光要放大些，看遠些！（二月二十五日於秦皇島）</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓二日電〕杜魯門總統今日向國會建議，增加美國進出口銀行貸欵能力十二億五千萬美元，俾可貸欵於英國以外之其他國家。其咨文內稱：國會如通過對英借欵三十七億五千萬元，美國庫存之欵僅將用以貸與英國，其他借款人須向進出口銀行聲請。若使該行之貸款能力增加十億美元，政府可共獲三十二億五千萬美元，以應付各國借款，至一九四七年六月底爲止。據國務院要人宣稱：蘇聯於去年八月間即向美國聲請借款十億美元，最近竟在政府檔案中失去，現已請蘇聯派員至華盛頓談判此項借款。</p>

<h3>主力艦是否無用？母艦是否成古董？　原子彈試驗後方可獲解答</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約二日電〕今夏在馬紹爾羣島比基尼島舉行之原子彈試騐，不但可以測騐原子彈對於主力艦之破壞力，且可決定今後戰具分配之方式。美國及世界之海軍專家目前已有懷疑主力艦是否無用，航空母艦是否將成博物院內之古董者。美當局之重視比一問題，可由決定停止繼續建造四五〇〇〇噸巨型主力艦坎塔基號一事見之，海軍部船舶司長奈許，己請衆院海軍委員會於原子彈試騐後，有決定以何種方式配備坎塔基號。海軍當局擬使其成爲最堅强之軍艦，或許將配以較十六吋口徑大砲更超級之新武器，此等新武器，或僅爲一小型之球體，或則爲火箭放射設備。同時探悉美海軍正在建造中之新艦三十七艘中，已有八艘被拆卸，中有重巡洋艦一艘，驅逐艦兩艘，坦克登陸艦一艘，驅逐護送艦兩艘，潛艇一艘，及驅逐艦一艘。此八艦之總建造費共三千二百萬鎊，已耗之費用亦已達二千萬鎊。杜立特將軍曾告參院稱：海軍所以供運輸登陸部隊，陸軍可以使侵入本土成功，然而B二九型機已能消滅利用海陸軍之必要。主力艦早已無用，航空母艦亦即將無用。海軍專家，對於航空母艦之效用，近來爭辯殊烈，尼米資大將認爲艦載飛機爲對日戰爭勝利之因素，原子彈必須載至距目標接近之地，始能使用，然則使用海軍仍爲必要。關於此次原子彈試騐之費用，非正式方面估計，當在一千萬元以上。平民對於此次試騐之價値，已有發生肄問者，有認此次供犧牲之船舶九十七艘，均預先妥置各處，其損害均已儘可能預先予以計算，然則除證實已知之結果外，恐不能有新發現，且供試騐之船舶，均屬無能爲力者，常不能認爲現代海軍適當之試騐。新聞記者已得允許前往參觀者共一百五十名，如屆時適常順風，彼等可進至距離爆炸地七哩之處，經澈底檢查炸後之反響後，記者等即可至被炸區視察船舶被損之情形。試騐時在該島週圍之珊瑚礁置有鋼箱保護之自動攝影機，攝製爆炸情形。在空中復有無綫電操縱之無人飛機，自空中攝取照片，其上更有人類駕駛之飛機，攝製活動影片，供試騐之船舶，大部份已拖往該處，巴基尼島以及距該島二百哩處加蘭島上之士人，均將令其撤退，參加兩次試驗之人員共二萬人，海軍當局謂彼等次無任何危險。</p>
<h3>原子彈之可怖高熱　廣島生靈立化灰燼</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓二日電〕遠東委員會代表團印度代表沙克西那歸來後，談視察日本廣島之情形稱，原子彈在廣島爆炸後調查，謂有一萬七千人失踪，料此一萬七千人均已爲炸彈發出之可怖高熱當場化爲灰燼。該市死者總數當有八萬一千名，發見之屍體共四萬七千具，有一萬七千人於炸後，因不勝炸彈爆炸後毒氣之侵入，而絡續死亡，其餘失踪之一萬七千人則恐已當場化爲灰燼。醫院中尚有少數可望生存之人，然亦不免終身留有瘢痕。</p>
<h3>美發起民間縮食運動　救濟全世界災黎　擔保增加對華食品接濟</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓一日電〕前總統胡佛今日與杜魯門總統及其他熟心人士，在白宮舉行會議，討論救濟世界民食問題，事後招待記者稱，美國將盡全力擔保增加食品接濟中國。美國民間縮食運動將立即發動，世界各地需麥二千萬噸，現僅可得一千五百萬噸，不足之數將由美國供給其大部份。救濟飢荒問題不能以種族·信仰·膚色之不同而加以歧視，故日本亦將列入救濟計劃之內，世界各國現待救濟者約在五萬萬人以上。</p>

<h3>江南四月暖風吹來時　主席住在那裏？　還都前的一個謎</h3>
<p>〔本報南京粇訊〕南京在鬧屋荒，連蔣主席住宅問題，到現在也還沒有解決。四月，一會兒便要來到，這個問題苦煞了馬超俊市長！</p>
<p>在抗戰以前，主席的官邸，在中央軍校的東北角，一座小小的紅色洋房，兩邊有兩座較大的辦公廳及會客室，和一些不大藝術的呆板的小屋給侍從人員住。這些屋，經過日本人一度利用後，實在不大成樣子了。軍校目前是陸軍總部所在地，總部聽說在五月間要撤消了，以後做甚麼用處，尚不可知。主席住在這東北角荒凉區域，實在太不合適。</p>
<p>中央軍校兩度下榻</p>
<p>去年十二月底，主席來京，住在這個地方，據說自來水電燈都發生過問題。這一次，主席來京，又住在這裏，夫人沒有來，這個荒凉地帶，更加警衛森嚴，實在不適於六十歲老年人的居住。他一生是嚴肅的，但是至少要給他一點溫暖的環境，藝術的環境，而這一角却像一片荒野。</p>
<p>不飲盜泉不住奸屋</p>
<p>汪精衛在城北西康路，造有一座大洋房，考究極了，偉大極了，舒適得不可想像。市府當局是留下來給主席住的。前次主席夫婦來，夫人心中以為大鬧屋荒的時候，住住也無妨。她同主席來看房子，主席一進去，便老大不舒服，厲聲說：「是誰要我來住這個地方的？」左右嚇得不敢作聲，夫人也不堅持，因為主席是完全講氣節的：「便是口乾，也不飲盜泉，」便是咱沒得房子住，也不住大漢奸住過的房子。這一次夫人沒有來京，房子問題更是擱起來了。</p>
<p>無恥溫逆盤踞大樓</p>
<p>在國府路的國民政府有主席大樓，那是他辦公約地方，抗戰以前所造。四層呆呆板板的建築，第一層是各單位人員辦公室，第二層正中一小間朝南的，是主席辦公室，第三層是國府會議廳，四層是電台。這個房子，汪精衛沒有用過，是給偽立法院院長溫宗堯享受了一些時候。溫宗堯這個獃子，養了許多姨太太，怕姨太太跟人跑了，於是都住在他辦公室附近的房子裏。</p>
<p>風吹雨打漏損甚鉅</p>
<p>原來的文官處處長辦公室，參軍處處長辦公室，都是姨太太。門上的玻璃窗，為怕姨太太隨便偸看別人，也用柳安薄板釘上，溫逆的女兒也住在裏面。每層樓都有一個鐵門，以防暗殺。連米煤等都堆在裏面。漢奸過的日子可以想見。這座大樓雨打風吹，現在漏損得不成樣子，據說一修要數千萬元。現雖還都期近，可是還沒有開始動工哩！</p>
<p>步行出入不合情理</p>
<p>這裏原來是太平天國洪秀全的天王宮，曾國藩打下南京，變成兩江總督署，大是大極了。由大門到主席辦公大樓，足足要走十分鐘，汽車又開不進去，眞是走累了主席，要六十歲的老人走進走出，實在太不合理。</p>
<p>蔣主席要正式還都了，他住在那里才好呢？</p>

<h3>一千三百萬顆心熾燃着！廣西人在苦難中</h3>
<p>— 本報航訊　梁小中寄自桂林</p>
<p>刦後的廣西，像一個崩坍了堤岸，長滿了蔓草的池塘，荒凉而又寂寞。桂林淸麗的山水，遮掩不了戰火的殘痕，七星岩裏的白骨，獨秀峯前的忠骸，和着一片斷壁敗垣，寫下了一篇水遠塗　不去的歷史。再走遍了西江兩岸的漠野，十室九空的情狀，更會令你不忍看，不敢想，但是，可喜的是一千三百萬顆心都沒有冷！</p>
<p>過去桂省的政治，許多人都知道算得上修明兩個字，今天的環境多少有了變化，但是要替八桂找出一條新生的大路底人却沒有忘記這一着。</p>
<p>省務會議開一次　總撤免幾個縣長</p>
<p>「與民生息」這四個大字，是政府的希望，百姓的要求，甚麼人敢茍擾飽受了苦難的人民，遲早總會遭殃，每一次省務會議，一定脫不了幾個縣長撤職，幾個縣長免職，於是桂林破破爛爛的馬路上，新縣長，舊縣長，想做縣長的，滿街跑，求情，求差，求路，大家都在想法子「更新」自己。一個卸掉了縣長的公務員嘆了一口氣說「這世界眞難，一張郵票也可以換掉一個縣長。」是的，廣西的現階段施政要點裏，說明對百姓一定要好，對幹部一定要嚴，從省境光複到今天，沒有一個縣不換過了父母官，可惜的是：省裏辦事的人心是一樣，到了縣裏辦事的心腸，又是另外一條。官難做，好的官也確難找。不到一年，因貪汚凟職而被拿起來的不下二三十個，（廣西只有九十多個縣。）</p>
<p>廣西的民衆是無助的，沒有人來接收他們的心。他們只是在自己安慰着自己。南國的農民實在太馴良了，還在無言地忍受着一切苦難，不願意說更多的話。譬如說：收復區豁免了田賦，但是一部分的縣份，（如武鳴·天保一帶·）却在装痴装聾的補殺，或者是另外立一個征收倉儲征的名目，桂東一帶花樣百出的稅捐，更弄到百姓莫明其妙，呌苦連天，農民賣了他們的命根——牛，典盡了一切可憐的財產，捐淸了，身家也淸了，再加上一向就窮得慘，於是賊骨頭出來了。</p>
<p>難民領到急賑費　悄無一語哭嚎啕</p>
<p>廣西的治安，向來是出名的好，這自然是得力於訓練有素的團隊，然而自從一次大災大難以後，小災小難就更兼連夜雨，一場大苦難，全省却只領到五千萬元的救濟費，得過五十噸的救濟品，不是說眼紅，光只一個浙江大學的復員費已經是三億元，五千萬元實在做得甚麼呢？廣西眞是太悲哀了！難民最近才領過「一筆」急賑費，數目是每名一次過三百元，三百元在今日可以買兩斤米，或者是半斤牛肉，或者是半包香烟，難道難民傾家蕩產之餘，就只値這三百塊。</p>
<p>一個難民領到錢後，當塲把鈔票撕掉，嚎啕大哭起來，一句話也不說！他們還能够說甚麼呢？自然，我們並不是說政府厚此薄彼，不過沒有注意到實情，體察到人民心裏的苦痛，却是事實。政府究竟應該想一個甚麼更好的辦法來滋潤一下，這羣生活在死亡綫上的人民！光只看見幾個城市恢復繁榮，只是近視的看法，我們要求政府看一看一直到今天還沒有得過半分農貸，半粒種籽的農村！</p>
<p>大牛車塞住公路　呼嘯一聲羣盜來</p>
<p>生產的凋敝，再加上運輸的阻滯，遂至調節無門，形成了物價的升官圖。首先是米價起來發難，最可怕的是桂西南一帶，從六千多元的價錢漲過了一萬五千元的大關，桂北有湘米運濟，桂東有來自廣州的泰米，所以還徘徊在一萬二三千之間，但是，大批的軍糧還要從這片乾了的土地上採購出去，再有小奸商的從中作祟，於是物價步步靑雲，黃金打過了十四萬，最壞的土布也要四五百元一尺，像樣一點的旅店要二三千元一夜，要行，更是「行不得也哥哥。」從南寗到廣州一段短短的旅程，非四萬元動不了身，桂林到南寗的旅費也差不了多少，衣·食·住·行，四難皆幷，今日的廣西，已非理想的樂園了。談起經濟，廣西確實沒有操縱市塲的巨擘，小商人作不了大風波，但是銀行以別的命義去開金舖，少數人把握着一個「執經濟牛耳」的企業公司，看下去多少總覺得有點不十分順眼。最近，商人也派遣了五個代表去重壓請求救濟，請求跟着多了。桂西北的山林瘴　，本來就是綠林的逋逃藪，到了今天，為了窮，為了餓，再加上一小部分有組織有野心的煽動，（如去冬竄擾十萬大山的股匪。）許多有用的漢子賣了山，買了槍，幹起了「月黑殺人，風高放火」的勾當。不論鄕村小鎭，治安力較薄弱的如左右兩江的小縣份也都風聲鶴唳，岌岌自危，山林地帶如此，平原腹地也未見例外。强盜最垂涎的，是公路上塞滿了貨，塞滿了客的汽車，（沒有客貨，汽車輪胎也是目標，一個輪胎，就是十多萬，）搶車的方法眞妙：先把兩輛大牛車塞住公關，讓迎面而來的汽車開不過去，於是羣盜呼嘯一聲，蜂擁而至，洗刦一空，而且廣西的强盜頗小氣，大多是「先要命，再要錢，」於是命案也就層出不窮，雖然不能說是萑苻遍地，也實在是羣盜如毛，忙煞了政府，急煞了保安隊。</p>
<p>桂省向以窮出名　現在是雙倍困苦</p>
<p>於是有計劃地來一個大淸鄕，由各縣縣長親自督率團隊出發，剿撫並進，一直到今天，收的效力自然不小，做的好的固然地方寗靜，做得不好的也未嘗不雞飛狗走，為了淸鄕而向輿論界訴苦的，也層見不窮。淸鄕是治標的辦法，根本的辦法還是要小心看一看支離破碎的農村，再何苦透了的農民援一援有力的手，這便要看政府的整個次策了。在此我們不妨看一看廣西的救濟工作。</p>
<p>憑良心說：廣西實在是雙倍的苦，從來就以窮出名。</p>
<p>家儲白米一小罎　即視若稀世珍品</p>
<p>舉一個例：桂西桂北的農民，一向就長年茹素地吃着包粟和薯芋，偶一有較為過得去的家庭會有一個小罎子裝着米，這些米甚麼時候吃呢？除了每年除夕吃一頓，春節吃幾餐之外，簡直視若稀世之珍。記者久別家鄕，囘到家裏，天天啃白米飯，每餐必有多人圍攏過來，好奇的望着我，奇怪的是我餐餐吃飯而不吃包粟，說起來，實在啼笑皆非。偏偏再加上年前的一場浩刦，八十七個縣份的土地荒蕪了泰半，屋漏商業貸欵，請求償還徵用物資，如此這般，豈僅農民要救濟？</p>
<p>有水無舟行路難　黔桂路亦未修復</p>
<p>商民的請求中，要求立即修復黔桂路，自然商人的出發點是為了便利商運，但是實際說來，黔桂路湘桂路的趕修，（最近合稱為湘黔鐵路，）不但合乎商民的需要，其實也針對着國防的需要，現現成成被拆去的鐵路，還要趕着恢復，豈有因為抗敵而毀的路反而丟在腦後不予修理的道理？消息最初的報道是：「限期三月底修復黔桂路桂段，」後來又是「改期四月初動工，」其實等的是器材，一批員工早就在宜山住着了。席西的交通，今天就全指望公路，桂林，柳州，南寗，梧州，（通到戎圩）欽州，廣州灣，長沙，越南，全有汽車聯運，搭車因為商營運輸行的競爭，所以還便利，就是票價貴了一點，而且總多少有點危險性就是了。公路的迅速修復，興建，純粹是民衆的力量，征工搶修，老百姓一征就來，一來就幹，硬是服從到少有。</p>
<p>至於水路運輸，廣西今日有的是河，缺的是船，除了梧州到廣州有輪船可達而外，其他機邕江，鬱江，柳江，撫河，漓水一帶，爛汽船也少得見，船不是沒有十多條，只是一槪都給拉到下河廣肇一帶而沒有囘頭而已。</p>
<p>賠了夫人又折兵　為文化鞠躬盡瘁</p>
<p>文化，敎育，不說還好，說起來傷心。「最高學府」國立廣西大學領到復員費十多萬，從貴州還沒有「復」到廣西境，就已經「完」了。現在算是在柳州鷓鴣江一列不像模樣的房舍裏上課，但是千多個孩子却讀得起勁，儘管圖書儀器散失的散失，沒錢運回的沒錢運回，還是一樣算是一個國立的大學，校長現在還呆在重壓，想亦法要一點經費之類。中小學也都早便恢復了上課，教師的薪水折了又和，還有拖欠，一樣咬着牙關，替五十年代的國家樹人，學潮的事情少到沒有大家都明白地互相體諒着。</p>
<p>全省的報章雜誌屈指可數：廣西中央日報的桂林版和南寗版，廣西日報的桂林版，柳州版和百色版（最近遷南寗）算是大報，此外各縣一分日報，或者是油印的簡報，大多由縣黨部主辦，三二百份銷路而已。雜誌在桂林頗有雨後春筍之槪，如半日文萃，嶺表論壇，建設月刋……等等，多數是廣西人辦，廣西人看，比起前兩年來，不堪回首極了，書店出版社之類，更是絕無僅有，還有一點奇怪，就是這裏一年多看不見外地輸入的一本刋物！</p>
<p>「中國是世界各國遭受損失最重大的國家，而廣西則為全中國遭遇破壞最澈底的省份」，這句話一點也不誇張。要政府注意這一片土地，也是一千三百萬人帶着眼淚的請求。八桂的子弟出了錢，出了力，出了命，難道換來的就只是五千萬元的救濟？我們相信政府不會無動於中，更不會讓南疆重陲的廣西荒凉下去！自然，努力克服當前的困難，也正是廣西子弟自己的責任所在！</p>
<h3>解次上海住宅問題</h3>
<p>— 邱旱雲</p>
<p>上海為我國門戶，工業中心，國際貿易，薈萃於斯，人烟稠密，建築物供不應求，在戰前已呈恐慌之現象。自日本侵華以來，燬於砲火者為數甚夥，而內地生產機構破壞，加以治安不良，四方流亡，咸視上海為樂土，扶老携幼而來者，如水就下，於是住宅問題，更有岌岌不可終日之勢。一屋之出租，一室之相讓，其黑費輒以黃金數十百兩計，薪水階級，無力問津，惟有望門興歎而已。至於勞働階層，蜷伏於鴿窩，跼處於草棚者，更無抬頭之望。今欲解次此項問題，惟有提倡大量建築，而建築之先次問題，則在土地之利用。如果有志建築者而無土地，與有土地者而不願建築，則此一問題，永無解次之日。環境市內公有之塲地，私人之園圃，所在皆是，令人眞有富連阡陌貧無立錐之感。勢不得不期待政府之努力，依照平均地權之原理原則，實行干涉主義，强制建築，以適應大衆之需要。茲舉其步驟如左，願關心社會福利者，一討論之。</p>
<p>廢止跑馬塲改為住宅區</p>
<p>跑馬塲位於市區中心，佔地數百畝，平時荒廢不用，每年一度兩度供西人跑馬，其目的不過為賭博斂財之工具，有百害而無一利，縱使以鍛練馬術為言，則郊外亦可為之，此皆西人豪華之舉措，有背我國善良風俗。現在租界收囘，主權在我，亟宜明令廢止，為適應公衆需要起見，宜測量劃分編號，任市民投標競買，限期建築。如此則市內建築物，在短期內即有一部分增加，供求關係，雖不能驟躋於平，總可期獲有幾分接近。一而將競賣所得之地價，指定為建築平民住宅之基金，妥愼運用，建築第一批平民住宅，廉價出租，其收費以塡補此項基金之利息為限，更向銀行借欵，進行第二批之建築，週而復始，無處竭蹶，數年以後，上海住宅問題，當可解次泰半。顧有一部分人士，主張改跑馬塲為公共體育塲者，猶是西人豪華觀念，未嘗注意平民福利之論調也。吾人權衡輕重，未敢茍同，因跑馬塲位置衝要，競賣結果，可獲巨價，足供建築平民住宅之運用，調劑供求關係，即無異平均地權於全上海市民也。公共體育塲可於郊外設置，殊無浪費市區中心之必要。</p>
<p>調查私有土地强制建築</p>
<p>按私有土地，在三民主義理論下，殊無處分之自由。除運動塲工作塲及名勝園林可供公共遊覽者外，私人園圃，佔地不得過於其建築物之面積。有超過於其建築物之面積者，皆可以自私自利妨害公衆居住論。政府宜派廉員明確調查，指定界綫，限令地主在一定期限內自行建築，過期不建築者，則由政府强制徵收之，以為建築平民住宅基地。其强制徵收所應給之代價，則發行　期公債以應付之。不得動用前項指定之建築基金，以免影響政府建築之資力。</p>
<p>公設地上權以廣招徠</p>
<p>前項强制徵收之結果，可供建築之曠土，為數必多。如政府無此財力，可以儘量建築，則宜招徠需要土地之市民，及有志建築之資本家，承領所需要之土地。在一定年限內（二十年至三十年）許期有建築使用之權。期滿仍由政府收囘，增建平民住宅。此種法律關係，可名之為公設地上權。承領人須一次繳納相當於强制徵收之價金，作為徵收土地短期公債準備金，專供此項公債付息還本之用。承領人在一定年限內不再給付地租，期滿時可拆卸建築物取囘其材料，政府無收買其建築之義務，亦不退還其承領時所繳之價金。</p>
<p>調查私有建築物强制出租</p>
<p>上海市內房屋恐慌，固係事實。而豪華之房主，房屋過剩廢棄不用者，與夫貪婪之房主，需索黑費封閉不租者，仍所在多有。政府宜派廉員實地調查，限期出租，過期則由政府介紹租戶，房主不得拒絕。如此實行干涉，亦抑平供求關係之一道。</p>
<p>設立房屋介紹所</p>
<p>依照職業介紹所辦法，設立房屋介紹所。因前項調查結果，凡屬於强制出租之房屋，介紹所應繪圖登記，並詢明房主要求最低之租價，照租戶登記之先後，為合理之配合。租戶登記時，應報明家屬人數，需要房屋間數，及最高租價之負擔力。介紹所配合以後，仍令直接訂立租約，雙方對於租價，如有齟齬，可聲請評價委員會評定之。</p>
<p>設立房屋評價委員會</p>
<p>前項租約，固待評價而成立。尚有租賃契約成立多年，房主要求增租，房客置之不理，形成僵局者。必須有公平之評價，俾雙方知所遵守，方能相安於無事。雖然，評價不難，而欲評價之合理實難。評價過高，致租戶疲於負担，固屬不仁。評價過低，直接的固係剝削房主應得之利潤，間接的則影響投資者心理，咸認建築為無利可獲，人人裹足不前，供求關係，愈趨愈遠，殊非獎勵建築之道，亦屬不智之事。平心論之，當此百物騰貴之際，有產者與無產者同感困苦，故租金不可不增，而黑費在所必禁。</p>
<p>以上所陳，關係上海全市民衆之福利，甚願賢明當局，社會名流，見義勇為，排除萬難，一致起而圖之。</p>
<p>讀者意見</p>
<h3>從X光檢查統計數字中看上海　原來是一個肺癆都市</h3>
<p>在大戰以後，食物醫藥俱感缺乏，肺癆蔓延各國，均遭遇嚴重之襲擊。上海為我國人口最多之都市，肺癆之猖獗亦遠較其他城市為甚，因肺癆為傳染病，每一患者能散播無數之傳染種子，骨肉親友，時相接觸，無不有被傳染之可能，而大都市中患者愈多，則公共健康所受之危害亦愈大，人口密集，接觸頻繁，無人能確保自身之不受傳染，X光檢查，一方可使病者獲早期治癒之機會，而自絕傳源，一方可使人知所防範，而避免受染，實為公衆健康獲得安全保障之最切要工作。</p>
<p>記者為明瞭肺病猖獗的情况下，特於日前往訪虹橋療養院主持人。該院對於X光檢查之推行，年來非常努力。頓據該院發表一年來之檢查統計，共二四三五人，其中心肺正常者不足半數，而患有肺病者，竟達六二六人，佔全數百分之二四强，為數實堪驚人。（參看X光檢查統計表。）</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>向蘇聯抗議·向中共忠告</h3>
<p>— 王亞明</p>
<p>東北蘇軍食言爽約，至今不撤，且進而作久駐準備，同時蘇方對我傳有「四項要求」提出，迫我承認其特權，東　於此時忽提出所謂自治要求，領土主權的割裂分離，不斷醞釀。張莘夫之被害，寗有不同於蔡公時之被殺？藩陽同殉的　射，亦異殊於北大營的砲聲。</p>
<p>現在當然是大戰方終，參戰各國，無論勝負，國力祇有减損，次無增長，死的死，傷的傷，固然，應不會有任何國家企圖發動戰爭，但即此不欲發動戰爭的心理，却是促成外交戰的最好引誘，因為厭戰，遂可以「戰爭威脅」來獵取更多外交戰果。現在這些心理上行動上竭力避免戰爭的國家，都受到姿態上行動上疾進急取的國家的威脅，這是戰後國際局勢不安的事實。中蘇間關於東北問題的緊張，亦即此種國際局勢中嚴重的一個環節。茲分述四點，以說明我們對這一問題的看法。</p>
<p>「安全需要」與勢力範圍</p>
<p>國際糾紛在未發之前，必有糾紛所產生的主體，這主體常常是國際糾紛的主角，也就是「不滿現狀」的國家。在此次戰前，那些不滿現狀的國家，發出「領土資源重分配」的呼聲，紛紛向他國問鼎，製造許多國際糾紛，以至世界大戰的爆發。現在那些高呼一領土資源重分配的國家，已經被公判了，處刑了，被認為侵略國家而敗亡了；因此，今日不滿現狀的國家，便有新的口號了，他們認為不向外伸張，在國境綫外，建立緩衝地帶，或緩衝國，甚至劃入勢力範圍，便無法保障他國家的安全，他們是為了「安全需要」而向外伸張。蘇聯人民外交委員長莫洛托夫於十月革命廿八週年紀念演詞說：「我們沒有一個任務比鞏固我們的勝利的那一個任務更重要的了。這勝利是我們在堅毅的鬥爭中得到的，它打開了一條走上我們國家的新的偉大的興起和將來改善我們人民的生活水準的道路。我們從來沒有面臨過，規模如此巨大的社會主義建設的前途，和蘇維埃聯邦威力的增長的這種可能」。蘇聯是現實主義地掌握其史無前例的機遇，擴張領土主權，以鞏固其勝利的成果。以保障其國家「安全」。但在一國的安全，必須向外伸張始能保障的時候，國際糾紛便接踵而起了。蘇聯憧憬着「帝俄時代的威權」，在雅爾達協定中留下了有傷國際和平的陰影。殆中蘇條約訂立，他們又企圖在東北建立其安全綫，把東北成為緩衝地帶，甚或為勢力範圍。可是中國的安全被破碎了，中國的領土主權被割裂了，牽涉到了中國國族存亡的問題，問題十分嚴重。</p>
<p>「人民政權」與國家分裂</p>
<p>造成國際糾紛的動機，一定是某一國家的「向外伸張」，這向外伸張的對象，一定是比較弱的國家，向外伸張的方式是策動弱國內的動亂，像日本那樣直接干涉的愚蠢行為，當然是落後了，在國內動亂之中，便能進行其拓展勢力的圖謀。中國的東九省，也正出現了所謂「人民政府」與「人民聯軍」。尤其可怕的是在中國出現的人民政府，雖然很有幾個，但他們各自之間，也不能形成統一的組織，這是分裂中的分裂，而這種作風，比之日本把中國分為滿洲溥儀與南京汪偽一樣，把侵佔的地方，漢奸傀儡也分裂開來，不相統一，然後可以遂其實際控制的目的。</p>
<p>戰爭與和平</p>
<p>日本投降以後，史達林委員長說：「現在我們可以認為我們的祖國在西方已經解除了德國侵略的威脅，在東方已經解除了日本侵略的威脅。」以國力空前膨脹的蘇聯說，「解除威脅」，並不就是蘇聯該認為滿意的目的。她更需要的是「安全保障」。蘇聯為鞏固勝利，為掌握千載一時的機遇，其擴大領土主權的行動有三：一是兼倂如波蘭白俄羅斯蘇維埃，捷克的外克爾巴阡烏克蘭，羅馬尼亞的莫爾達維亞，波羅的海克尼斯堡不凍港，波羅的海三小國倂稱蘇維埃共和國，芬蘭的貝查木區，日本的南庫頁烏和千島羣島的倂入蘇聯版圖，已經成為蘇聯的領土，其次成立緩衝地帶，如北太平洋的染指，及受制日本的爭執，希臘，伊朗間與英國的衝突，是屬於這一類的。第三是劃分勢力範圍，建立親蘇政權在中國東北的現勢與演變，頗有傾向於這個目的。</p>
<p>據筆者的看法，和平與戰爭不是絕對的，如果為間接的利害衝突，即僅為緩衝地的爭執，這是尚可以維持相當均勢的讓步，戰爭不會輕易發生，但若直接的利害衝突，或「均勢」將被打破的時候，即利害關係涉及勢力範圍與領土主權的時候戰爭會突然而作。慕尼黑協定英國所以犧牲捷克而不與德國破臉，波蘭被侵就決定對德宣戰；「九一八」事發，中國已不能不準備着武裝的保衛，而蘆溝橋砲火，却展開了全面抗戰的序幕，這就是和平與戰爭的分界。然則今天東北問題，是否可能成為世界和平的威脅呢？我以為今日蘇聯實際上已席捲了外蒙，並且在東蒙和新疆，也牽引着「特殊化」的運動，轉瞬間頗可能變為蘇聯的勢力範圍，那時，無論是中國的抗議或國際的干涉，都有引發戰爭的可能，時至今天，和平與戰爭之間，已經沒有一個「慕尼黑」的空隙了。</p>
<p>愛國與「排外」</p>
<p>東北局勢陰霾密佈之中，全國靑年激於義憤，舉行示威遊行，高呼口號，要求蘇聯撤兵東北，要求蘇聯尊重我國領土主權的完整，要求各黨派放棄私利，團結一致，共紓國難。中國共產黨人由於與蘇聯的情誼，很卑視這種愛國的熱情，他們說「愛國與排外必須分開，中國應與國際合作，不要引中國作排外行動，中國過去把愛國與排外混在一起，今日希望不要把愛國行動引至排外。」這幾句話，彷彿說愛國決不能抗議蘇聯，抗議蘇聯便不是愛國。她的意思是說抗議蘇軍不撤出東北，就是「反蘇」，「反蘇」就是排外，然而這與日本在八年前說中國「排日」「反日」的理由，又有何區別？日本以「排日」的罪名來打擊我國民衆的愛國行動，終致發動了「七七」事變，今日我們的靑年學生是天眞的，他們記憶以「排日」的罪名來壓迫還不敢公然附和，現在我們抗議蘇聯食言爽約，遲不撤兵，殺害接收人員，運走東北物資，就是漢奸也不敢辯護的事，中共竟大言不慚，叫靑年學生不要「排外」。我們的國家固然需要與國際合作，但像八年前以「經濟提携」「共同防共」等題目，來强迫我們合作的合作，能夠應允他們嗎？中共沒有看見蘇聯製造中國的分裂，侵害中國的國權，以及奪取中國的物資，却看見靑年學生在「排外」，在「反蘇」，於是不勝遺憾地誣陷學生的愛國就是「排外」，這我們不必替中共硏究，中共對於國家分裂運動，實已屬於「罪首」的地位，對於蘇軍久駐，無異認為衷心感激，這種媚外逞願的心理，則已昭然若揭。</p>
<p>最後幾句</p>
<p>由於上述的觀察，我們可知東北問題的嚴重，實已構成第二「九一八」的形勢，如果蘇聯沒有侵略的野心，也該在這時改途易轍，不可以把盟邦作伸張勢力的對象，如果蘇聯眞有侵略的野心，那末在這時東九省還不能成為確定勢力範圍之前，應該予以制止，否則一旦事態造成，對蘇聯的利害關涉擴大，再欲阻遏，便不可能了。至於中共，我們也願意促他們覺醒，「兄弟關於墻外禦其侮」，否則中共即使能在蘇聯孵翼下好像一時有所「成功」，其可憐的程度，恐怕與溥儀汪精衛沒有差別的呵！因此，我們向國際要喚起正義的重視，要提　慕尼黑的失着；在國內要激起土耳其的精神，以嚴正的外交修正國際間帶着侵略意味的行動。</p>

<h3>中行負責調劑匯市　金市人心轉好　美鈔實貨不易脫售</h3>
<p>赤昨因中行貝總裁發表談話，認為下週一實行調劑匯市，並不實行掛牌，隨自然水準調度，人心稍見轉好，市況亦因而較為活躍，過程穩定，晨開一四三萬，買戶連秧而來，交易雖少，一度哄抬至一五〇萬以上，證券幫逢高仍有供給，逐漸回挫至一四一萬，錢兌業代雜行　　吸收尚股，午刻又一度　榮，惟一五〇萬大關迄難穿越，午後仍不支而退，最低達一四二萬賣價，最後仍在一四七萬以上，（內中有隔週交易）較前收績升七萬，中行餘　取市價為調之依據，大　將有一番盤旋，銀　飾金掛十五萬人，紋銀一千八，銀元八五〇元，有　，暗拆仍站原價，高價二角半，低價一角八。</p>
<p>外幣美鈔隨金市而進退，情形已略好轉，　頭仍在七一〇元對十兩問進出不一，入後始終屈居二千元大關以內，中途雖有回升，為時至　，業外人不易脫售，批持鈔者繼續恐慌，一度缺乏　主，而退至一九二〇元賣價，後以金市回升，被動帶好少許，結果較前收毫無榮辱，對黃金套價最後竞拔開至七四元對十兩，人心對現鈔輕視，可見一斑，港要稍稍轉穩，惟交易不多，結果老貨回升至十元，新貨好起三元。</p>
<h3>證券回疲</h3>
<p>公債堅後稍回，雜牌追隨趨榮，丙種自晨初一九五〇元，回落至一八〇〇元，舊多頗有出籠者，銀錢業小型餘資尚有吸納，結果尚較前收好起少許，甲乙丁各好八十元，戊種升五十元，華股上場再告挺進，終以交易尚　公開性不甚活潑，獲利者逢高有所脫手，銀根亦緊，堅後轉疲，永紗最高二九〇〇元強，美亞二三〇〇元，景福一四〇元以上，午刻回落一成結束，較前收計永紗跌五十元，美亞七十元，景福五元，外股亦與華股同趨回落，怡紗自六五〇〇元調價回小一成，其他各股亦跟之難支，結果較前收大股跌半成，小股則一成以上</p>

<h3>陰雨影響來源　米價繼續上漲　油豆餅亦均回升</h3>
<p>昨日米市以天雨連綿，來貨減少，店胃尚股，致價格再升千元有零，油價連疲之後，店言乖巧納取，消化轉活，回漲二三千元，豆餅亦升一二百元，黃豆高貨平平，中關見升千元，麵粉則因消化轉　，外埠納胃停止，價回小二三百元，皮胃呆，價續疲一二百元，形勢不振。</p>
<h3>絲綢交易轉盛</h3>
<p>近日來絲綢又見抬頭，銀根雖緊，交易尚稱不惡，昨市廠絲高五担貨價與止日相仿，下午普通五担貨有成交，價二百念七萬元，另担與十經價比上日較高，人造絲一二〇號天橋現貨一百八十二萬元開　，開後續升至八十四五萬元，收　達一百九十萬元，較上日高十萬元，綢市非常有興，交易頻繁，以致各檔俱見做高，美亞　而每百條一百三十萬元，大　格璧　開盤每碼四千元，後做至四千二百元，民生織綿　，每件一萬七千五百元，林記　　紗每碼二十元</p>
<h3>溫紅供多價跌　其他　平定如恒</h3>
<p>日前抵埠之溫州喬登門紅茶，客方已有接洽，乃市上現貨頓見充斥，價格方面達被迫轉疲，結果下跌甚巨，比前竟小去四五千元之　，其他花色續在供求雙方談盤羅殊中，是以做開交易依然不多，而　勞平定如故，至於福建方面，聞於日內將有相當敷最之紅綠花茶運滬。</p>
<h3>紗市盤旋　現棉交易平疲</h3>
<p>昨紗市因前日下降已巨，買戶稍有吃胃，金價已告回升，紗價乃見轉定，計二十支　馬復出百萬大關，最後成交百零二萬，較昨約升六萬之謵，其餘各支亦好三四萬左右，人心尚　，且下之紗市似人盤旋之局面，紡建公司平售各色　呢毛毯等類，聞下週一　開售棉紗外，尚　開售大宗棉布云。</p>
<p>昨日現棉交易無其進寶，惟紡建略有問津，曾港美棉米得林二百件，價定四十一元美金計算，此外民營小型紗廠做開巴西花及三餘鎮花價均九萬元，同業互做周浦籽花價為一萬五千五百元，市價大致平疲。</p>
<h3>女色呢暢銷</h3>
<p>女色呢日來銷路仍頗暢達，頭號每碼批　一萬五六千元，二號一萬元左右，三號六七千元，賣買雙方俱因吃本較輕，而利益不薄，均藥於經售，廠方有驗於此，兼為原料成本關係，生產乃較細毛花呢為夥。</p>
<p>本市呢羢同業公會現已整理就緒，昨分函各會員店號，准於下星期三在天后宮市商會內召開大會，選舉理監事。</p>
<h3>外銷桐油　每担評價八萬</h3>
<p>桐油本因有出口去路，似與各物不同，業此者非常注意，旋以外匯遲不宣布，致均存觀　之心，近聞外匯宣布在即，興味轉濃，惟能配合出口銷場者，已評價至每市撥八萬元矣，內銷者亦須七萬六七千元，洪江桐油，自西副到後，形勢已變，本地自製之廠，自知不敵，勢將收東，淮　正西洪至亦不多，故各家雖定批售每桶六萬元，然均不肯多售云</p>

<h3>首都臨大學生案　檢察官提議緩刑　辯論終結三月六日宣判</h3>
<p>〔本報南京訊〕首都臨時大學學生滋事代表八人，經交保停止羈押，旬日前開過調查庭，調查事實完竣，於二月二十七日下午二時，由首都地方法院開辯論庭，出席推事三人，檢察官一人，書記官一人，被告並有義務律師八人出庭辯護，旁聽人數達四百人，自下午二時半開庭，至晚九時始散。法官以學生聚眾威脅，妨礙公務及自由兩項論處，學生聲述當日情狀，律師代為辯護，認為未在王主任實行公務時有所妨害公務，又謂王主任自動到敎部，非學生威脅而往，總說無罪，而法官考證笨事當時之實際情形，與偵察調查結果，仍欲繼之以法。辯論至久，由檢察官起立發言建議，以為學生完全為學業席捲之要求，而發生不幸事件，雖有千犯，其動機尚蜀純潔，無其他作用，情有可原，請審判長援引刑法上條交之規定，予以緩刑。再經各律師之辯論，遂由審判長宣告辯論終結，即行退庭，定三月六日宣判。據一般觀察，如宣判學生有罪，而予以緩刑，學生名義上有受刑事之限制，在刑期內，　奪公權，不能參與選舉。而實際上緩刑，未予執行刑事，仍可自由讀書，於人情法理，雙方兼願。</p>

<h3>共黨在冀南商都　籌設北方大學</h3>
<p>〔聯合社北平二日電〕共產黨正在冀南商都新設大學一所，名日北方大學，校長方萬綸，精研經史，歷三十二年，係民國六年畢業北大，曾任北大，中法大學等敎授。方氏之計劃，擬在北方大學使學術研究與實際應用，熔於一爐。方氏在北平共黨總部告聯合社記者稱，共黨並不主張廢棄原有之四書五經，恰與外間一般傳　相反，實則共黨亦極注意經籍，俾發現中國現時及未來發展之意義。北方大學不僅將作科學方法之研究，並將以實地經騐及應用相輔。學生與敎授，俱須費一牛時間，在其所修習學科中取得實際知識及經騐，俾追隨日新月異之科學發明而不致落伍。近年來科學與工業俱有迅速進展，中國必需迎頭趕上，方能廁身於強國之林。對於學生與敎授之政見，完全取超然態度，蓋傎正進步之敎育，必須首先有政治上及個人思想上之絕對自由。校方意欲將共產及醬主義之社會組織兼收並蓄，學生與敎授信服共產主義者，僅可照共產配給制度生活。現時報名入學者，已達七百餘人，敎授亦聘到十人，但開學之期，尚未確定。學校組織分級，（一）為預科，俾在過去數年中因生活動　而未獲卒業中學者得以補習，（二）為四年大學本科，（三）為研究院。</p>

<p>江蘇省立敎育學院，招考農業敎育學系，社會敎育學系，社敎系，地方自治敎育組，勞作師資　專修事組，新生各一班，定於本月十三十四兩日舉行入學考試，師範學校畢業者，得免試，英文改試敎育概論，投考家事組者得免試英文，報名自十一日起至十二日止，偽蘇敎院學生未經到院補習，而有志轉入　業者，投考如經錄取，得享受公費待遇。</p>
<h3>國民敎育與地方自治</h3>
<p>— 盧冠六</p>
<p>地方自治工作，除　　保甲，辦理　衛外，最重要的，就是推進國民敎育了。所以在行政區的組織中有文化敎育股，主持敎育工作，可知各區的負責人，都有推進國民敎育的義務。在新縣制裏更有詳細的規定，政府對於各區國民敎育的成績如何，更定為考成之一，因為地方自治和國民敎育，都是我國的基本工作，地方自治工作完成的地方，國民敎育的實施，易有良好的成績，國民敎育發達的地方，地方自治工作，也易於進行，二者相輔相成，實有不可分離的關係。</p>
<p>現在本市各行政區已先後成立，戶口調查也將告一段落，各行政區長就職以後，大都以整編保甲推行敎育為己任，這實在是良好的現象。現在有許多區的國敎工作雖已居積極推進，可是還有少數區政人員，對於推行國敎，不知從何着手，所以還沒有相當的成績表現出來。</p>
<p>（一）在調查戶口時，應同時調查識字人數及失學人數。在本區中學　兒童有多少？失學成人有多少？應該一一調查清楚，一方面既可明瞭本區敎育情形，另一方面更可以做執行國民敎育的準備，務使本區文　，有全部　除的一天。</p>
<p>（二）除戶口調查外，還要注意於學校調查。本區內的學校有多少？本區的學校數是否已能應付實際上的需要？如果學校嫌少，那末應該設法增設。學校分佈如何？如果分佈情形疏密不勻，應該設法調整。</p>
<p>（三）本區內的公地公產，也應加以調查。因為有公地廟屋，方可以開辦學校；有公產公款，才可以有學校基金。對於發展國民敎育，也是很有關係的。</p>
<p>（四）國民學校又稱公立學校。經費來源，除由政府撥款補助外，還要　地方人士自動籌集。所以區公所負責人應該設法推動本區熱心敎育及熱心公益人士，組織國民敎育經費籌募委員會，作為本區辦理國民敎育的經費，並須籌集基金，為擴充設備的費用。</p>
<p>（五）對於本區已辦的學校，更有　促和輔導的義務，因為各校辦理的的良否，對於受敎育兒童的前途關係很大。所以對於辦理認傎成績卓　的學校，應該給以　勵，對於辦理成績不良的學校，也應該給以指正，同時對於本區敎育研究的工作更協力推進，那末本區敎育成績的進度，就可以一日千里了。</p>
<p>敎育是建國工作中最重要的部門，對於兒童個人的事業，國家社會的前途，關係　大，希望負責地方自治人員積極注意，力謀改進，並確定計劃，分期實行，那末敎育事業，才能有突飛猛進的一天。</p>

<p>V隊—青聯（女組）五時卅分仁餘—V隊（甲二）六時一刻江灣—藍隊（甲一）七時一刻</p>

<h3>作家的生活問題</h3>
<p>— 唐紹華</p>
<p>改善作家的生活，這個問題曾經許多人提出，也多少引起了社會人士的注意。戲劇電影作家原是可以　於作家之　的，所以現在與其單獨來研討戲劇電影作家的生活問題，倒不如廣泛的來談一談作家的生活。誠然，作家在社會中的地位，是被稱為「智識份子」或「文化人」的，然而他們生活的艱苦，却是非　　所能形容。他們　天埋頭　案，攥緊毛　，挖腦絞血，也不過只能寫出幾千字來，設或「文章憎命」，到處　　，全家便要餓肚皮了。或幸而被採用了，所得的稿費，又能夠換幾升米麵呢？所以社會的　應該注意到作家的生活問題，說得更切實一點，便是作家的命運，現在已達到死活的分界線了！</p>
<p>再說，文化是社會的靈魂，作家便是運個簽魂的支撐者。我們不能讓作家的生活陷於艱苦，甚至難以維持，所以改善作家的生活，我們應該是贊同的。此外，作家人尊　，和他作品價值，也同是重要的問題。同時，一個作家，應該站在他自己的崗位上，　力發揮他所有的能力，負起推進社會文化，啓發文明思想的任務。在今日建國時期，更應為國家民族宣傳復興建國的道理，喚起全民共挽國運。尤其重要的，便是應該要有大無畏的精神，能夠做到「富貴不能淫，貧窮不能移，威武不能屈」的超然獨特的意志。為了忠於自身的任務，要以犧牲小我而利大我的精神，將自己的福利置於　衆的福利之下，作家的筆鋒，要成為　衆的前鋒，或推進社會的使舵者。無論在怎麼惡劣的環境之中，或強暴的劫持之下，要堅決而倔強地執行本位的工作，為才上的本色，和作家崇高人格的表現。所以關於改善作家生活的問題，是不會影響於作家所應有的精神的。</p>
<p>可是現在許多　　然以作家自命的，實際上他們却忘了自己本身的任務和本分的工作，善於標榜清高的，祇是花花月月，織口不談天下事，其更甚者，做了傳聲筒或應聲虫，淆亂黑白，歪曲是非，並利用作家的身份，掛起「前進」「自由」「民主」的招牌，詆毀當道或勾引青年向墮落的歧途上去。那麼，像這樣的作家，值得改善他們的生活嗎？——而且他們的生活也許比一般人還要奢豪得多——寄語親愛的作家們，若　要負起推進社會文化的任務，首先便要放棄那些胡思亂想，站在國家至上，民族至上的立場，探討真理，建樹新文化，而後來研討改善生活，這才不致本末倒　！</p>
<h3>演員的藝術創造</h3>
<p>— 殷燕</p>
<p>中國的演劇藝術，在日前雖然已經越過襁褓時代，可是離開成熟的階段尚有相當的距離。確實地說中國的演劇藝術仍然在學步中，還沒有能夠堅強的站立起來。不容否認近年來我們的劇　已經產生了不少優秀的演員，可是事實上這些優秀的演員，多數是憑著他們的天才在摸索，他們所得嚴格的經驗與知識，都不免太零碎，太抽象。而我以為演員目前必須研討的問題，應該是比較具體的，本質的。</p>
<p>現階段演員的藝術創造似乎運停留在一般人性的模仿上，在目前的演出上我們所看到的演員所創造的角色，大都我們總覺得非常單薄，很少能創造出典型來。一般地說或許是生活的不夠豐富，另一方面我想是沒有把握著人生形態的多樣性與復雜性。一個角色性格的把握是應該着重內發於心而形於外的原理。</p>
<p>演員在藝術創造里往往不善於揉合由人生所提取的素材，而以片斷的素材作為模仿的準　。然而典型的創造決不是單單憑依實生活中極少數的人物模仿而成的，而是以我們正確的藝術的認識，在許多人物中提鍊出各種各樣本質最具體的形態揉合而成的。明晰地說，我們當易於直接模仿片段的人生而稱這逼真的確模仿為藝術，這種論斷我以為是錯誤的，雕刻家W·W·Story說「藝術之成為藝術，因為它不是自然—所以自然最完美的模仿也不能算是藝術，藝術是精神的明鏡，所反映出來的自然都帶著精神中種種情感。」名畫家J·Lqfarge說得更簡明：「藝術是藝術家眼中的世界。」詩人歌德也這樣說：「藝術作品所以許可存在，唯一的理由是她與自然相異」。綜言之，一切被稱為藝術的作品，決不是單純地對客體之模仿，我們不應當忘懷「心的作用」，我們應當向我們心中由客體喚起而經過剪裁的影像模仿。</p>
<p>那末，什麽是演員藝術創造的準繩呢？亞理斯多德說得好：「最高藝術的創造，不但訴之於情感，且訴之于理知」。情感與理知的調協就是我們演員藝術創造的準繩。Air　Henry　Irving也曾說過：「演員應當充分表現出詩人所創造的思想與情感，而要做到這一步，他必須完全理解這些思想與情感，另一位是經驗　當注重實踐的法國戲劇家BC．Coquelin他這樣說：「成為演劇藝術的東西，　是那活的典型的創造，那是一切藝術中最人性的，因此我認為那才是藝術，換言之，那才是在與理的表現中混淆着「詩」的韻味和「理想」的影像」。歸納起來說，詩與哲學乃一切藝術的泉源，演員藝術創造也就是詩與哲學的依　與發陽。</p>
<p>「詩」能幫助演員創造想像，而「想像」乃是演員最大的資產，沒有了想像，便沒有了創造。一個演員在處理他的角色的時候，應該學習　詩人在處理他的素材一樣；將他的思想集中于某件具體的人生上，緊隨思想之集中，立即激起一種情感，同時　集起許多影像來，在這些感情的激動下，用綜合的方法將這些影像漸漸明亮起來，取得確定的形態以模擬人生種種色調。這些影像由我們的意志支配，並以德才人的靈感將其　濟，這樣演員的藝術創造便會漸漸地　當與充實起來。</p>
<p>哲學驟看起似乎與演員的藝術創造沒有什麽深切的聯緊，而實際上，戲劇是人生的表現，演員自然必須理解人生，要理解就非從哲學着手不可，人生的內涵是復雜的，多樣的，它是人類各種意志的棠流，歷史與環境的結晶，我們若要探索其本質，我們必須覺得完善的工具，而哲學正是最理想的工具。同時我們演劇的意義不僅在表現人生，並且要指示人生的道路；深言之，我們的任務不但在解釋世界，更要變革世界，什麽是正確的道路呢？只有哲學能夠幫助我們　找。</p>
<p>哲學幫助我們把握主題，幫助我們創造典型，它能使我們確定角色的人生觀，而這人生觀的認識，正是建樹典型的堅實的骨幹。</p>
<p>從另一方面看，最高價值的藝術必須含有一種「永存的意志」，它是美的靈魂，藝術家生命最高的表現與歡愉。繪畫藉畫布，音樂藉樂識，文學藉文字傳達其「永存的意志」。可是我們演員的藝術，為時間所限制，幾乎失去它的「永存的意志」。更明顯地雕刻與建　，以它們自己的身臨與時間抗術以表現其不可磨滅的「永存的意志」。可是我們演員的藝術，為時間所限制，幾乎失去它的「永存的意志」，然而果傎我們失去它，我們辛勞的藝術創造者將是如何的空虛呵！那末我們將怎樣來把將為時間所捲失的永存的意志呢？我們為我們演員藝術的永存意志是我們所表現的傎理，它永生於人類，以其倔強的意志，　人成千成萬的觀眾的心中，他們將用以變革世界改進人生，並予歷史直接的影響，而使我們身後的世代蒙受其利，使其輾轉傳留至無畫期，因此我們更必須去研究哲學，探索傎理，用以傳導我們藝術創造的「永存的意志」。</p>
<p>總言之，演員應向詩與哲學學習，它們能使我們的藝術創造益趨充實與豐富，詩是我們藝術創造的血與肉，而哲學是我們藝術創造的幹骨，它們能使我們的演劇藝術更結實地站立起來。</p>
<h3>關於歷史性的電影</h3>
<p>— 萊明</p>
<p>關於電影中含有歷史性的作品，已有很多的出現，但每一部歷史電影作品其中所包含的意義，大多由於每一個時期的不同而相異，如果我們去精密的檢查一下，就可樣探視出每一個時期中歷史電影的不同。</p>
<p>當今歷史電影，在中國及外國各有相繼的出現，至於我國的歷史電影，資料尤其相當丰厚，因有數千年的歷史長久，足夠為電影中所需要的歷史事實，但我國比較真實的歷史電影非常欠缺，原因一方面當然是人材的緣故，一方面因我國人民的智識比較淺薄，如過去的「孔夫子」一片，他雖然是一部很適合於學者的歷史電影，但結果不能受到大多數觀眾的瞭解，這是一個很明顯的例舉；歷史電影最多的國家那要算過去的德國，德國自第一次世界大戰後，衰落到極點，人民所求歷史電影中蜀含羅曼斯為戀愛書卷，這是個時期的歷史電影，自納粹獨捏裁權後，電影必然為染上了納粹的英雄色彩，作為宣傳的目標，更用來作為敎育國民必須混讀品了。其次要算電影國營最早的蘇聊，亦是應用社會主義的光榮歷史電影來鼓勵民衆，至於美國的歷史電影之多，早已聞名世界各國。</p>
<p>但是歷史電影，必須受批判的感染，為了站在歷史的事實之誤謬的訂正的前方，必須檢點他的歪斜的宣傳性，來防止假歷史電影的侵入觀眾。</p>

<h3>Soviet Transport of Northeastern Industrial Equipment; U.S. Declares Non-Recognition; Disposition of Japanese Assets Abroad Under Discussion with Relevant Countries</h3>
<p>[U.S. News Service, Washington, 1st] A spokesman stated today that news reports from the Northeast indicating that the Soviet Union is transporting so-called "war booty" from the region have prompted the United States to express its concern to the Soviet government. The spokesman said that the U.S. began discussing this matter with the Soviet government through the U.S. Embassy in Moscow about three weeks ago, and has recently started discussions with the governments of other related countries, without specifying which governments. The spokesman pointed out that these discussions do not mean that the U.S. has received confirmation of the Soviet Union's removal of so-called war booty, as the U.S. has not received direct intelligence on this matter, nor has it been officially informed of the actual situation. The State Department issued the following statement on the matter: "We have no secret or other agreements with the Soviet government or any other government regarding 'war booty' in the Northeast. The U.S. government does not recognize the interpretation of 'war booty' as including industrial or organizational elements, such as Japanese industries and equipment in the Northeast. Some time ago, we notified the Soviet government that the disposition of Japanese assets abroad, such as industries in the Northeast, is a matter of common interest and concerns all Allied nations that bore a greater burden in defeating Japan. During this period, it would be inappropriate to treat such industrial assets as 'war booty' and transport them from the Northeast, or for China and the Soviet Union to make any final disposition of Japanese assets abroad in the Northeast through agreements on the control of such assets. The U.S. government has recently begun discussing the issue of how to dispose of Japanese assets abroad as reparations with the governments concerned."</p>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 2nd] The U.S. State Department's announcement that the United States does not recognize the Soviet Union's seizure of Japanese industrial equipment in the three eastern provinces of China as "war booty" has been welcomed by Chinese figures in Chongqing. They believe that this announcement proves that the United States will adopt a firmer policy towards the Soviet Union regarding the Sino-Soviet dispute in the Northeast, and are therefore greatly encouraged. Currently, the main hope of people here is that China can re-establish its sovereignty in the Northeast without hindrance, as Chairman Chiang recently instructed the Northeast Headquarters, clarifying that the principle of negotiations with the Soviet Union is that China will not accept any demands that infringe upon Chinese sovereignty.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 1st] Former Director of the U.S. Office of Strategic Services, Donovan, said in a speech last night at the Overseas Press Club that the United States overestimated the strength of the Japanese army in Northeast China, resulting in the United Nations giving the Soviet Union too much reward for its participation in the war against Japan. Donovan stated that the secret agreement on rewards to the Soviet Union made at the Yalta Conference to get the Soviet Union to participate in the war against Japan was signed because the U.S. lacked intelligence on the Japanese Kwantung Army.</p>
<h3>Earnest Review of Party Affairs; Committee Members Speak Frankly; Second Plenary Session Holds Two General Meetings Yesterday</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 2nd] After 3 p.m. today, the sun filled the courtyard of the Military Affairs Commission. The committee members were attentively preparing for a heated debate in the afternoon. Dai Chuanxian took the chair and stated that everyone should speak on the review of the party affairs report, with a time limit of five minutes per person. No general meeting has ever been so frank and thorough in its discussions as this afternoon, which is historically significant. It is truly as Gu Zhenggang said, now is the time for everyone to take responsibility and for the party to show a spirit of democracy. This meeting was much more progressive in every aspect compared to previous ones. The speeches of Huang Yuren, full of passion and indignation, Gu Zhenggang's deep and serious thoughts, Chen Zhaoying's concern for the suffering of the people, Hu Qiuyuan's promotion of the true meaning of politics, and Chen Yiyun's plea for women's rights, all left a deep impression. Until the lights were all on, the chairman announced that the party affairs report would be reviewed by Pan Gongzhan, He Zhonghan, Deng Xipeng, and others.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] The first general meeting of the Second Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee was held at 9:30 a.m. on the 2nd. 226 members of the Executive Committee, including Yu Youren and Dai Chuanxian, and 80 members of the Supervisory Committee, including Wu Jingheng and Wang Chonghui, attended. The meeting was presided over by Committee Member Yu Youren. After the meeting began as scheduled, the chairman announced that the whole body should stand in silence to pay tribute to the officers and soldiers who died in the national war of resistance and to the compatriots who died in the disaster. Then, the Secretariat reported the number of attendees, read out the records of the preparatory meeting, and reported on letters and telegrams of leave requests from committee members. The Presidium then reported on the meeting dates, agenda, and other matters. After the report was resolved, Committee Members Xiao Zheng, Huang Yuren, Zhang Lisheng, Zhang Daofan, Zhou Bomin, Miao Peicheng, Xiao Tongzi, Cheng Zhonghang, Gu Zhenggang, Gan Naikang, Zheng Yitong, Lu, Dai Chuanxian, Liu Lianke, Wu Guozhen, Wang Xingzhou, Bai Haifeng, and others raised their opinions on the Presidium's report, and the discussion was extremely heated. As a result, the Presidium decided to withdraw the third item and the fourth and fifth items for further discussion. The seventh item was revised and passed. At 10:00 a.m., the Chairman announced a break for 15 minutes, after which the meeting continued. Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng made a report on party affairs, which lasted 55 minutes. The meeting adjourned at 11:40 a.m.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] The Second Plenary Session held its second general meeting at 3:20 p.m. on the 2nd. Chairman Chuanxian announced a review of the Party report, soliciting opinions from the committee members. Eighteen people spoke, making extremely frank criticisms of the merits and demerits of the Party, and elaborating on ways to improve in the future. The enthusiasm was unprecedented in previous meetings. The discussion ended at approximately 6 p.m. After Chairman Wang Xuanqian began the review, Ren Zhuoyi was the first to speak. He pointed out the shortcomings of military training propaganda and mass movements, and believed that it was necessary to prevent the erosion of bureaucracy. Li Jingzhai said that the Party must pay attention to the suffering of the people. Gu Zhengding advocated strengthening democratic practices and party leadership, and eliminating wavering elements within the party. Hu Jianzhong said that work should be improved, as facts are powerful propaganda for resolving various contradictions. Miao Peicheng spoke broadly on foreign policy, advocating open research. Huang Yuren emphasized the necessity of party innovation, unity and democracy, and questioned the implementation of the resolutions of the Sixth National Congress and the First Plenary Session. Wu Tiecheng advocated strict party discipline. Luo Gonghua said that the Three People's Principles had not been successful, and that civil rights and people's livelihood still needed to be worked on. Gesang Zeren raised opinions on border issues. Deng Feihuang used his limited experience in his youth thirty years ago to conduct a rigorous review of the Party. Xiao Zheng demanded a thorough review of the Party's system and personnel to clarify the gains, losses and responsibilities. At this point in the review, the chairman announced a fifteen-minute break. The meeting continued at five o'clock, and the committee members continued to speak. Liu Chengcan described the difficulties of local people's livelihoods and said that they should be improved quickly. Chen Zhaoying reported that the morale of comrades in various places was extremely high, which was encouraging, but the treatment of public officials at all levels was meager, and methods should be found to solve the difficulties. Deng Wenyi explained the composition of party members and the transfer of party members in the army. Hu Qiuyuan proposed a sense of responsibility and talent-based theory as the primary conditions for improving party affairs. Gu Zhenggang gave a summary of the Party's form, nature, and foundation, and said that saving the country must first save the Party, and a revolutionary spirit should be used to oppose counter-revolutionary forces. Peng Zhaoxian analyzed the current internal and external environment, and made a frank review of the relationship between the Party and the government, the Party and party members, and the Party and the people. Finally, Chen Yiyun pointed out the emptiness of the Executive Yuan's report, and that the failure to protect women's rights during the war of resistance was unsatisfactory. By this time it was 6 p.m. The chairman announced the cessation of speeches and handed the party affairs report and the opinions of the committee members over for review, and then proposed the list of the Party Affairs Review Committee and adjourned the meeting. The third general meeting on the morning of the 3rd reported on the surrender situation and made a review, and rested in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Delayed in Shanghai Due to Rain; Rescheduled to Fly to Chongqing This Morning</h3>
<p>[This City News] Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke arrived in Shanghai from Guangdong and was originally scheduled to fly to Chongqing the day before yesterday to attend the Second Plenary Session, but he was unable to travel due to continuous spring rain. With good weather this morning, he will soon fly to Chongqing. Yesterday morning, a reporter visited President Sun at his residence. First, they discussed the issue of the draft constitution. President Sun said: The constitution of a democratic country should be changed according to the different times and environments. Many provisions of the current draft constitution are out of date, so many places need to be added and revised. For example, one of the laws established before the war stipulated that the authorities in various places must transfer the criminals they captured to the judicial organs for handling within 24 hours, but this has not yet been implemented because there is a restriction in the supplementary provisions. In the future, this supplementary provision should be cancelled to promote its implementation. When the reporter asked about the Northeast issue, President Sun said: The reason why the Northeast has become a problem is because there is a problem with domestic unity. Regarding the Jiaochangkou Incident, President Sun was unwilling to say much, considering it a disgraceful matter.</p>
<h3>Hunan Surplus Grain Quota; Authorities Approve Reduction</h3>
<p>Hanping Sells Enemy and Puppet Materials</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Hankou, 2nd] (1) After various parties stated the difficulties of the surplus grain quota in Hunan Province, the grain administration authorities have approved a reduction. In addition, the Hunan Relief Branch has allocated one hundred million yuan to purchase seeds and distribute them to various counties to enable farmers to resume cultivation. However, due to the severity of the disaster, it is still difficult to advance spring plowing. (2) The enemy and puppet materials here will be sold cheaply for the second time, handled by the special commissioners of the Executive Yuan in conjunction with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Sales will begin within days and are scheduled to end by the end of the month. Most are daily necessities.</p>

<h3>Northeast Issue Expected to Make Progress; Xiong Shihui and Others to Leave Chongqing Soon; Zhang Jia'ao to Fly to Changchun with New Proposal</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanking, 2nd] Chongqing News: It is generally believed here that Soviet Ambassador Petrov's visit to Foreign Minister Wang the other day may bring new developments to the future of the Northeast issue. Also, Northeast Headquarters Director Xiong Shihui is said to be flying back to Jinzhou from Peiping within days. In addition, Zhang Jia'ao, Director of the Economic Commission of the Northeast Headquarters, will fly to Changchun within days. It is said that this trip carries a new proposal drafted by our government, which may give the Soviet side considerable concessions in terms of capital and technology.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Peiping, 28th] (Delayed) Zhang Zhizhong stated: The Soviet Union will definitely withdraw its troops, and the time is not far away. Military issues in the Northeast other than troop reorganization are expected to be resolved after this inspection of various places in North China upon return to Chongqing. In the future, the Military Mediation Department will send personnel to work in the Northeast. Before leaving Chongqing, Marshall had intended to inspect Shenyang, but it has been postponed due to the immaturity of the timing.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 1st] The Soviet Union's recent announcement of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Northeast has attracted much attention from all parties. However, the authorities have not received any reports of the Soviet army withdrawing. According to news from the Northeast, there are no signs of the Soviet army withdrawing, and newly mobilized troops are distributed in Harbin, Lushun, Dalian and other places. The Soviet Union's announcement is a propaganda effort to ease the patriotic sentiments of our people. Its intentions should be recognized by the people of the country. According to general observation, if the Soviet army does not withdraw, it will be a violation of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Treaty, and all responsibility will be borne by the Soviet side. Various groups in the accompanying capital are urging our government to seriously negotiate with the Soviet side on the withdrawal of troops.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 2nd] The Kunming City Council, due to the repeated postponements of the Soviet army in the Northeast, telegraphed the National Government today to seriously negotiate and declared that our country is not bound by the Yalta Secret Agreement.</p>
<h3>People from All Walks of Life in Shijiazhuang Hold Mass Rally</h3>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanking, 2nd] Zhenjiang News: Students from elementary and middle schools in Zhenjiang held a patriotic movement parade on the 1st due to the delayed withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Northeast, shouting slogans such as "Defend Northeast Sovereignty" and distributing leaflets along the way.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] The Yu Xi schools students in Chongqing held a memorial meeting for Zhang Xinfu and other seven gentlemen today in the auditorium of Shapingba Middle School.</p>
<h3>Military Spokesperson Refutes Rumors</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] According to a statement issued by the military spokesperson of the Military Affairs Commission on the 2nd: The Xinhua Daily published a telegram from the Northeast on March 1 today, falsely claiming that "Du Yuming shot and killed 29 CCP members including Guo Yachen in Tongliao." After investigation, the report has no factual basis. So far, the National Army that entered the Northeast has only reached Zhangwu, more than 140 kilometers away from Tongliao. Since the National Army has not arrived in Tongliao, the newspaper's false accusation that Commander Du shot and killed CCP members in Tongliao is self-evident. The troops sent by the government to the Northeast are all formal National Army troops, and there is no so-called Guang Division, nor are there any Seventh Division of the First Army and Division Commander Zhou Xuwu. The Xinhua Daily did not investigate the facts and deliberately fabricated rumors, which is inappropriate.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 2nd] After Zhang, Zhou, and Marshall arrived in Jinan, they first listened to a report by Colonel Kirk of the Jinan Group. Then Zhang Zhizhong, Zhou Enlai, and Marshall spoke separately. Zhang Zhizhong said: In the future, the Shandong situation should be based on the spirit of mutual trust and mutual concession, and sincere cooperation. Zhou Enlai said: Now that some major problems have been solved, there should be no difficulty in solving minor problems. After thanking the Jinan Group, Marshall used baseball as an example, saying that although the U.S. is not an umpire, it should inform both sides of the baseball rules and ethics that should be followed.

<p>Marshall's Speech</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 2nd] Before leaving Jinan, Marshall said at the lunch hosted by Commander Wang and Chairman He: The handling of some pending issues depends on the rapid restoration of transportation, which is of great importance to the revival of the entire China. The agreement we have reached is an agreement that both parties can agree to. We will not discuss who was right and who was wrong in the past, but only do what should be done now. I wish China an unlimited future. Those who participated in the banquet included Zhang, Zhou, and Marshall and their entourage, government and CCP officials in charge of military and political affairs in Shandong, and U.S. personnel.</p>
<p>Arrived in Xuzhou in the Afternoon</p>

<h3>From Shanghai to Qinhuangdao (2)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper in the Northeast, Han Qingtao</p>
<p>—Six Days at Sea Following the Northern Expedition with the Army—</p>
<p>Local prices are quite high. White flour is more than 300 yuan per jin, rice is 4,600 yuan per dou, glutinous rice is 3,600 yuan per dou (each dou is 16 jin), pork and beef are 400 yuan per jin, vermicelli is 400 to 460 yuan per jin, lump coal is 20,000 yuan per ton, crushed coal is 10,000 yuan, Lao Dao and Hademen cigarettes are 160 yuan a small box. Other daily necessities are also priced twice as high as in Shanghai. "Puppet United Reserve Bank" currency is still in general circulation, with an exchange rate of five yuan for one yuan of national currency. Many businessmen leave through this port to purchase goods in Shenyang for significant profits because prices in Shenyang are low. Therefore, trains going north are extremely crowded. The journey from here to Tianjin is even more packed. Train fares are very cheap, with a ticket from Qinhuangdao to Tianjin costing only 400 to 500 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>In terms of administrative division, it is under a place in the Linjian County. The county government has an office in Qinhuangdao. The population is over 20,000, and education is relatively developed. There is a county-run junior high school in the city, divided into middle and elementary school sections for both boys and girls, totaling over 1,000 students. There are also six or seven public and private elementary schools, each with an average of 300 students. The elementary schools have already started on the 21st, and the county middle school is scheduled to open on the 25th due to the presence of troops.</p>
<p>Several people in the education field told the reporter: "The education community in the occupied areas suffered greatly during the past eight years. In North China, with very few exceptions, they endured humiliation and steadfastly defended themselves, making significant contributions to maintaining the lifeline of national education. All students were able to concentrate on their studies and avoid external affairs. After the recovery of the country, they should have been rewarded. However, not only is this not the case today, but the term 'puppet' is added to teachers and students, which is quite infuriating and disheartening."</p>
<p>The garrison of Qinhuangdao is currently the responsibility of the New Sixth Army and the security forces. At the docks, the US Marine Corps is responsible for police affairs and maintaining order. It is reported that the US Navy has also sent Marines to several other northern ports to perform temporary guard duties.</p>
<p>The US Navy landing ships that helped us transport the New Sixth Army, the Youth Army, and the New First Army (most of the New First Army arrived in Qinhuangdao on the 25th and immediately headed north) belong to the 78th and 14th Squadrons, commanded by Colonel Mennes. They are famous ships that participated in the landing operations on Iwo Jima and the Philippines. Many still have painted markings on the command deck showing the number of Japanese aircraft shot down and Japanese ships sunk.</p>
<p>The ships are equipped with small cannons, machine guns, and anti-aircraft machine guns. The bow of the ship has electrically operated iron gates to allow tanks, armored vehicles, jeeps, and personnel to enter and exit the cabin. Our soldiers rested in this large cabin, about 40 zhang long, and could walk up to the deck via a large staircase, which could also be raised or lowered electrically. Each side of the ship has cabin windows, each fitted with forty-one hammocks, as well as toilets, showers, medical rooms, etc. They gave up one side to our officers of all ranks, while the crew's living arrangements were mostly at the rear of the ship.</p>
<p>The American crew members of each ship are energetic and responsible in their work. However, due to differences in customs and our extreme poverty, many unpleasant incidents occurred between the two sides. The No. 596 ship, which the reporter first boarded, can be taken as an example.</p>
<p>On the first day of boarding, the ship insisted that our soldiers unload their guns, tie them up in batches, and send them to the ammunition depot along with the gunpowder, because accidents involving munitions and weapons had occurred during previous transports. We had no choice but to abandon the "guns should always be with the soldiers" rule and follow their regulations.</p>
<p>A new type of submachine gun carried by a battalion commander's attendant was taken away by an American sailor and disappeared without a trace. After much negotiation, only a certificate was issued by the captain when changing ships, stating that it had been "taken and lost by his subordinates."</p>
<p>In addition, many unpleasant things happened regarding cooking, toilets, water usage, and other activities. During this period, a lieutenant liaison officer dispatched by the US military, accompanied by a Chinese translator, conveyed the opinions of both sides or answered questions. Because the US Army authorities agreed to be responsible for transporting the National Army northward, they later requested the Navy to handle it due to the inconvenience of airplanes. Therefore, the liaison officers sent by the US Army could not make many decisions. The liaison officer on the landing ship I boarded was Graftoa, who was very enthusiastic and responsible.</p>
<p>The opinion of our troops is that the American Navy personnel and sailors are executing the orders of their superiors and assisting us in transportation. They can only help technically and cannot interfere with or direct our actions. Also, in the event of an accident or if they believe something is inappropriate, they can negotiate and discuss it with our troop commander and cannot make arbitrary decisions.</p>
<p>This time, the reporter followed the army on the ship for six days, sailing for three days and three nights. I have many thoughts that are difficult to describe in full. Today, I would like to write about some urgent issues that the authorities and everyone have a responsibility to improve and implement together: First, our marching diet is too difficult. It requires cooking on the spot at any time, which is cumbersome, time-consuming, dirty, uneconomical, and does not provide enough nutrition. Therefore, we must adopt the advantages of others and manufacture marching rations suitable for us, especially when traveling by train and ship.</p>
<p>Secondly, soldiers' compensation still needs to be reasonably addressed, because the current income is too far from other sectors of society. Also, the equipment in the military is still very poor. Both mental and material conditions are depressing, which is a great loss to the health and morale of the soldiers.</p>
<p>Thirdly, all actions need to thoroughly implement the New Life Movement. Agility and cleanliness need to be thoroughly implemented by everyone. This time, the Youth Army generally did well on the ship. Although the crew was still dissatisfied with spitting and urination, they were better than the general public who spit and urinate everywhere. In addition, the Youth Army was dusted with delousing powder upon boarding and sprayed with disinfectant once on the ship.</p>
<p>Leaving the mouth of Wusong, we rarely saw our ships. What we saw were the numerous sails on the river and the isolated sails on the sea. On the contrary, foreign ships came and went. The authorities and all compatriots must work together to help the country build merchant ships. It is too dangerous to rely entirely on others. In particular, I hope that speculators will not circle around manipulating prices but broaden their horizons and look further ahead! (February 25th, Qinhuangdao)</p>

<h3>Franco Remains Unrepentant, Deploys 200,000 Troops on Spanish Border, Vowing to Safeguard Security at Any Cost</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 2nd Broadcasting: After convening an emergency meeting today, the Spanish Cabinet issued a declaration by Franco, stating that the current deterioration in relations between France and Spain is entirely due to "Communist elements stirring up trouble." It also stated: "Red terror is spreading, forcing Spain to seal the borders between France and Spain." Franco claimed: "Communist elements are now supplying weapons to Spanish guerrillas, attempting to overthrow the current regime." Franco also denounced "attempts by certain countries to overthrow the Spanish regime." He also stated: "Spain will defend its national security at any cost."</p>
<p>According to a Paris dispatch, Franco has deployed 200,000 troops on the French-Spanish border.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 2nd Broadcasting: The Spanish people's resistance to the Franco regime is intensifying, especially the activities of the guerrillas. The guerrillas are spread throughout the country, and their traces can even be found in Madrid. It is reported that Franco has decided to take terror measures to cope with the current domestic crisis. In order to maintain the Fascist foundation, Franco intends to carry out a restoration under the "guise of democracy."</p>
<p>[Associated Press Madrid Dispatch, 2nd] The Spanish Franco government today pointed out that France's closure of the Spanish border is the responsibility of the "Communist group that listens to foreign slogans." A statement issued by the Spanish Cabinet stated that the Spanish government "holds an unwavering heart, is determined to maintain order, and guarantees national security, knowing that this is an expression of the unanimous feelings of all the Spanish people. At the same time, it calls on the conscience of all to oppose this unprecedented movement, which attempts to plunge an orderly and peaceful country into chaos and unrest by the worst means. This country adheres to international obligations and does not lag behind others." The statement also stated that the "movement" against Spain was launched as a protest against the recent execution of ten Spaniards, in an attempt to "glorify ordinary criminals as martyrs for political ideals."</p>
<p>[United Press New York Dispatch, 2nd] The New York Times today reported in a Washington dispatch that officials from the Army, Navy, and State Department are currently informally seeking ways to supply fighter jets to France in the event of war between France and Spain.</p>
<h3>Rumor: Franco Has Been Notified to Hand Over Power Within a Month</h3>
<p>[United Press London Dispatch, 1st] The London Evening Standard "Star" today published in a prominent front-page position: Franco has been notified to end his regime in Spain within a month. The newspaper also stated that if Franco does not hand over Spain to a democratic government, the United Nations Security Council in New York is scheduled to begin taking action within three weeks to force him to comply.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington Dispatch, 2nd] The US State Department announced last night that the British government, following France, has in principle accepted a US-proposed trilateral declaration condemning the Franco regime. It continued, stating that the declaration may be published simultaneously in London, Washington, and Paris tomorrow.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington Dispatch, 2nd] High-ranking government officials here said that the wording of the joint statement by the United States, Britain, and France demanding that Spanish dictator Franco step down and prepare for fair elections in Spain has in fact been agreed upon.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington Dispatch, 1st] The content of the US proposal on the Spanish issue has not been officially announced, but according to diplomatic sources, the US government suggests that the first point is that the three countries publicly announce their opposition to the Franco regime, hoping that the Spanish people will rise up to replace it as soon as possible. The second point is that the three countries will recognize the Spanish interim government as soon as Franco steps down, in preparation for the country to hold free elections. A State Department spokesman announced that Britain and France hope to continue to consider this proposal before issuing a statement.</p>
<p>[French News Agency London Dispatch, 1st] The British Foreign Office has received a French note stating that the French government is urging the British authorities to pay attention to Franco's deployment of troops to the French-Spanish border to increase defenses, and declaring that Spain's concentration of heavy troops is enough to endanger world peace.</p>
<p>[French News Agency French Perthus Dispatch, 1st] The border between France and Spain has been closed since noon yesterday, but no accidents have occurred. Both sides have increased the number of officials to prevent accidents before the closure. The last batch of travelers crossed the international bridge at 10:30 PM.</p>
<h3>US Export-Import Bank to Increase Lending Capacity</h3>
<p>Truman Recommended to Congress Yesterday</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington Dispatch, 2nd] President Truman today recommended to Congress to increase the lending capacity of the US Export-Import Bank by $1.25 billion, so that it can lend to countries other than Britain. His message stated that if Congress approves the $3.75 billion loan to Britain, the US reserves will only be used to lend to Britain. Other borrowers must apply to the Export-Import Bank. If the bank's lending capacity is increased by $1 billion, the government can obtain a total of $3.25 billion to meet the loan needs of various countries until the end of June 1947. According to key officials of the State Department, the Soviet Union applied to the United States for a loan of $1 billion in August last year, but it has recently been lost in government files. The Soviet Union has now been asked to send personnel to Washington to negotiate this loan.</p>
<h3>Hurley Severely Criticizes Britain and the Soviet Union for Violating the Atlantic Charter, Saying Imperialist Ideas Cannot Be Tolerated</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Albuquerque, New Mexico Dispatch, 1st] Former US Ambassador to China General Hurley delivered a speech here, criticizing American foreign policy, saying that the moral support, productive power, and armed forces of the United States should not be tainted with robbery ideas. We have proven that the principles we are fighting for show that we are stronger in production and stronger in combat, but weaker in diplomacy. Hurley severely criticized Britain and the Soviet Union for not complying with the principles of the Atlantic Charter, and said, "We certainly did not tell the soldiers that we are fighting to promote Soviet territorial annexation and imperialism, or for the imperialism and dictatorship of France and the Netherlands in their colonies."</p>
<h3>The United Nations Once Planned to Build a 2 Million Ton Aircraft Carrier, Using a Mixture of Ice and Wood Pulp as Material</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Washington Dispatch, 1st] Classified wartime documents released by the United States, Britain, and Canada show that the United Nations Chiefs of Staff once planned to build an aircraft carrier weighing 2 million tons using a mixture of ice and wood pulp, but it was never realized. This aircraft carrier was like a floating iceberg on the ocean. Once built, it would be over one-third of a mile long and have 50-foot-thick walls, making it impervious to torpedo attacks. The body would also have air conditioners to prevent the ice from melting. A 1,000-ton model was once built on a lake in Canada, but it was destroyed after six months. The purpose of building this cold-material aircraft carrier was to travel to the frigid areas of the North Atlantic to search for German submarines and serve as a mobile base for the European Air Force. According to the authorities of the United States, Britain, and Canada, ordinary ice is too fragile to build this aircraft carrier, so a mixture of ice and wood pulp was used to prevent it from breaking under severe shocks. The original British plan was to build an artificial iceberg, 2,000 feet long, 300 feet wide, and 200 feet deep, weighing 2 million tons, requiring about 70 million yuan, equipped with electric motors to propel it forward, and anti-aircraft guns on the deck. After the Quebec Conference in August 1943, the US Navy authorities once planned to build this ice ship to attack Japan, but later decided to abandon it.</p>
<h3>US Surplus Silver to Be Sold Abroad</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Washington Dispatch, 1st] It was learned from reliable sources today that the US Surplus Property Administration may soon unfreeze 57.4 million ounces of silver as surplus metal for sale abroad at 75 cents per ounce. The shortage of silver is becoming increasingly apparent, but it is no longer within military supplies. The result of the government's sale of surplus silver will be a net profit of approximately $2 million. At the same time, Congressman Pengge submitted a bill to Congress requesting that the price of gold be raised to $56 per ounce, so that the price of silver would be set at $1.29 per ounce.</p>
<h3>Prime Minister of East Indies Resigns, Parliament Unanimously Approves Reconstruction of Government, 2,000 Dutch Troops Land on Bali</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Batavia Special Dispatch, 2nd] After fierce debate, the National Committee of the Indonesian Parliament yesterday expressed its support for the recent proposal by the Executive Committee to reconstruct the Indonesian government, passing it by a vote of 140 to 67.</p>
<p>[Reuters Batavia Dispatch, 2nd] It has just been learned from the Netherlands that Dr. Shari, the Prime Minister of Indonesia, has resigned.

<h3>US State Department Clarifies Economic Policy Toward Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 1st] The State Department today issued a formal declaration, outlining for the first time the clear and precise framework of the United States' economic policy toward Japan. It stated, "We have not, and will not, assist Japan in rebuilding its export industries with economic power. Generally speaking, the policy of the United States is to encourage Japan to produce and export non-military or non-defense-related goods in order to obtain the necessary foreign exchange to purchase food, fertilizer, and other essential imports to maintain a minimum standard of living, and to prevent the occupation forces' burden from increasing. Therefore, the United States will encourage the production and export of silk, tea, pottery, coarse fabrics, and other handicrafts." This declaration is generally similar to the economic policy towards Germany, with the quantity of exports being limited to what is necessary to obtain domestic necessities. The State Department stated that General MacArthur is fully responsible for all import and export affairs of Japan, and at an appropriate time, American agents and the Japanese government can also be used.</p>

<h3>Local Dispatches</h3>
<p>Kunshan</p>
<p>Formulating a City Construction Plan: The county government, in order to rebuild the city after the war, has formulated a city improvement and construction plan in light of local conditions and people's lives. In addition to widening the main and branch roads in the city to 12 meters, 10 meters, and 6 meters respectively, the plan also widens various highways, such as Kun-Hu and Kun-Tai. The total construction area reaches 1.45 square kilometers. It is expected that after the implementation of the plan, Kunshan's urban area will be completely renewed.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Rice Market Improved After Suppression: Since the county government took emergency measures to suppress [prices], the county's rice market has gradually improved. The market is in good order, and recently, goods from the countryside have continued to arrive in Suzhou. Therefore, high-quality white rice has fallen below the 25,000 yuan mark. High-quality coarse rice opened at 20,500 yuan, and inferior goods are only over 17,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Maintaining Sovereignty, Telegram to Protest: Chairmen and directors of the East China, Southeast China, and Chongqing branches of the Chinese National Industries Association telegraphed the Chinese National Industries Association to request the issuance of a protest and declaration to China and abroad to clarify the standpoint of China's industrial community in order to recover territorial sovereignty over the Northeast. (Telegram omitted)</p>
<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Discusses Suppressing and Stabilizing Prices: After the rice store riot in Hangzhou, a similar incident occurred in Yongjia, and it also affected various cloth stores at the same time. Yesterday, the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce convened various trade associations and, after discussion, passed six measures to suppress and stabilize prices: (1) Trade associations in the city will earnestly advise and be responsible for suppressing and stabilizing the prices of goods in their respective industries, standardizing prices in each store. (2) The association will assess and determine prices based on the actual situation of the source, and stores may not change them without authorization. (3) The assessed prices will be tabulated once every five days and reported to the city government for approval by the City Chamber of Commerce. (4) When raising prices, a cost table should be created, and for imported goods, prices should be based on the Shanghai market quotations and announced to the public to build trust in the community. (5) The market prices of gold, silver, and new medicines are based on Shanghai telegrams. If there are any changes in selling prices at any time, the Chamber of Commerce will submit them to the City Government for approval and variations. (6) Request the Security Command, Provincial Government's Department of Social Affairs, and City Government Police Bureau to pay close attention and prevent unexpected events from occurring.</p>
<p>Administration Distribution of Flour: The Zhejiang-Fujian Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief Administration will directly distribute flour to Hangzhou for emergency relief.

<p>Secret Agent and Traitor Arrested in Fengxian</p>

After the victory, the traitor remained at large and transformed himself into a patrol officer in the Fengxian Police Bureau. Unexpectedly, the net of justice is inescapable. He was encountered by a fellow villager in Fengxian, who, moved by righteous indignation, reported him to the local authorities, who immediately detained him.</p>
<h3>Are Battleships Useless? Are Aircraft Carriers Obsolete? The Answer Will Be Revealed After the Atomic Bomb Test</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 2nd] The atomic bomb test to be held this summer at Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands will not only test the destructive power of the atomic bomb on battleships, but will also determine how weapons will be distributed in the future. Naval experts in the United States and around the world are already questioning whether battleships are useless and whether aircraft carriers will become museum antiques. The US authorities' emphasis on this issue can be seen from the decision to stop the continued construction of the 45,000-ton giant battleship Kentucky. Naval Shipbuilding Director Nash has asked the House Naval Affairs Committee to decide how to equip the Kentucky after the atomic bomb test. The Navy authorities intend to make it the strongest warship, perhaps equipped with new weapons even more powerful than the 16-inch guns. These new weapons may be just a small sphere or a rocket launch device. At the same time, it has been learned that of the 37 new ships the US Navy is building, eight have been dismantled, including one heavy cruiser, two destroyers, one tank landing ship, two destroyer escorts, one submarine, and one destroyer. The total construction cost of these eight ships is £32 million, and £20 million has already been spent. General Doolittle told the Senate that the Navy is so that it can supply transport landing troops, and the Army can make the invasion of the mainland successful, however, the B-29 aircraft has been able to eliminate the need to use the navy and army. Battleships have long been useless, and aircraft carriers are about to become useless. Naval experts have recently debated fiercely the effectiveness of aircraft carriers. Admiral Nimitz believes that carrier-based aircraft were a factor in the victory in the war against Japan. Atomic bombs must be carried close to the target to be used, so the use of the Navy is still necessary. The unofficial cost of this atomic bomb test is estimated to be over $10 million. Civilians have already begun to question the value of this test. It is believed that the 97 ships sacrificed in this test have been properly placed in various locations in advance, and their damage has been calculated as much as possible in advance. Therefore, in addition to confirming known results, it is feared that no new discoveries will be made, and the ships used for testing are all incapable of acting. It cannot be regarded as a modern naval appropriate test. 150 reporters who have been granted permission to visit can be allowed to go to a point seven miles away from the explosion site, if the wind is fair at the time, after thoroughly checking the post-bombing reaction, the reporters can visit the bombed area to inspect the damage to the ships. During the test, automatic cameras protected by steel boxes were placed on the coral reefs around the island to film the explosion. There are also radio-controlled unmanned aircraft in the air, taking photos from the air, and there are also manned aircraft taking moving pictures, most of the ships for testing have been towed to the island, and the people of Bakini Island and Karan Island, which is 200 miles away from the island, will be ordered to withdraw, a total of 20,000 people will participate in the two tests, and the Navy authorities say that they are at no danger.</p>
<h3>The Terrible Heat of the Atomic Bomb Instantly Turned the Living Beings of Hiroshima to Ashes</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] After returning from a visit to Hiroshima, Japan, Mr. Saksena, the Indian representative of the Far Eastern Commission, said that an investigation after the atomic bomb exploded in Hiroshima revealed that 17,000 people were missing. It is expected that all 17,000 people were instantly turned to ashes by the terrible heat emitted by the bomb. The total number of deaths in the city should be 81,000, with a total of 47,000 bodies found. 17,000 people died one after another after the bombing due to the intrusion of toxic gases after the bomb explosion, and the remaining 17,000 missing people are feared to have been turned to ashes on the spot. There are still a few people in the hospital who are expected to survive, but they will inevitably have scars for life.</p>
<h3>US Launches Civil Frugality Campaign to Help Famine Victims Worldwide, Guarantee to Increase Food Aid to China</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 1st] Former President Hoover held a meeting today at the White House with President Truman and other interested parties to discuss the issue of global food relief. Afterwards, he told reporters that the United States will do its best to guarantee increased food aid to China. The US civil frugality campaign will be launched immediately. 20 million tons of wheat are needed around the world, but only 15 million tons are currently available. The shortfall will be supplied mostly by the United States. The famine relief issue cannot be discriminated against based on differences in race, religion, or skin color. Therefore, Japan will also be included in the relief plan. There are currently more than 500 million people in need of relief worldwide.</p>

<h3>When the Warm Winds of April Blow in Jiangnan, Where Does the Chairman Reside? A Mystery Before Returning to the Capital</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch] Nanjing is experiencing a housing shortage, and even the issue of Chairman Chiang's residence remains unresolved. April is fast approaching, causing Mayor Ma Chao-chun considerable distress!</p>
<p>Before the war, the Chairman's official residence was located in the northeast corner of the Central Military Academy, a small red Western-style house, flanked by two larger office buildings and reception rooms, along with some uninspired, drab little houses for the staff. After being used by the Japanese, these buildings are in a sorry state. The Military Academy is currently the headquarters of the Army General Headquarters, which is reportedly to be disbanded in May. Its future use remains unknown. It is truly inappropriate for the Chairman to reside in this desolate northeast corner.</p>
<p>Twice Lodged at the Central Military Academy</p>
<p>When the Chairman came to Nanjing at the end of last December, he stayed in this place, and it is said that problems occurred with both the water and electricity supply. This time, the Chairman has come to Nanjing and is staying here again. The Madam did not accompany him, and this desolate area is even more heavily guarded, making it truly unsuitable for a sixty-year-old man to reside in. He is a man of great integrity throughout his life, but at least he should be given a warm and artistic environment, whereas this corner resembles a wilderness.</p>
<p>Not Drinking from Robber's Spring, Not Residing in Traitor's House</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei built a large Western-style house in the West Kang Road in the north of the city, which is extremely elaborate, grand, and unimaginably comfortable. The municipal government intended to reserve it for the Chairman's residence. The previous time the Chairman and Madam came, the Madam thought that it would be acceptable to stay there amidst the severe housing shortage. She went to see the house with the Chairman, but as soon as the Chairman entered, he felt extremely uncomfortable and sternly said, "Who wants me to live in this place?" Those around him were too frightened to speak, and the Madam did not insist, because the Chairman is a man of great integrity: "Even if thirsty, one would not drink from Robber's Spring," even if we have no house to live in, we will not live in a house once occupied by a great traitor. This time the Madam did not come to Nanjing, and the housing issue has been further shelved.</p>
<p>Shameless Traitor Wen Occupied the Building</p>
<p>In the National Government building on Guofu Road, there is the Chairman's Building, which is where he conducts official business, built before the war. It is a four-story, dull and drab building. The first floor houses the offices of various departments, the second floor has a small south-facing room in the center, which is the Chairman's office, the third floor is the National Government conference hall, and the fourth floor is the radio station. Wang Jingwei never used this building; it was enjoyed by Wen Zongyao, the head of the puppet Legislative Yuan, for a while. Wen Zongyao, the idiot, kept many concubines, and fearing that his concubines would run off with others, he housed them in the buildings near his office.</p>
<p>Wind and Rain Cause Significant Leaks</p>
<p>The original offices of the chief of the Civil Affairs Department and the chief of the Military Affairs Department were all occupied by concubines. The glass windows on the doors were covered with lauan plywood to prevent the concubines from secretly peeking at others. Wen's daughter also lived inside. Each floor had an iron door to prevent assassination. Even rice and coal were piled up inside. One can imagine the life of a traitor. This building has been battered by wind and rain, and now it leaks severely. It is said that repairs would cost tens of millions of dollars. Although the return to the capital is imminent, work has not yet begun!</p>
<p>Walking in and out is Unreasonable</p>
<p>This place was originally the Heavenly King Hong Xiuquan's palace of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. After Zeng Guofan captured Nanjing, it became the Viceroy of Liangjiang's yamen, which was extremely large. It takes a full ten minutes to walk from the main gate to the Chairman's office building. Cars cannot drive in, truly tiring the Chairman. It is truly unreasonable to have a sixty-year-old man walking in and out.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang is about to formally return to the capital. Where would it be best for him to reside?</p>

<h3>Thirteen Million Hearts Burning with Passion! The People of Guangxi in Suffering</h3>
<p>— Our Air Mail Dispatch, Liang Xiaozhong from Guilin</p>
<p>Guangxi after the calamity is like a pond where the embankment has collapsed, overgrown with weeds, desolate and lonely. The beautiful scenery of Guilin cannot hide the scars of war. The white bones in the Seven Star Cave, the loyal remains in front of Solitary Beauty Peak, along with a scene of broken walls and ruins, write a historical account that can never be erased. Wandering along the desolate fields on both sides of the West River, the sight of nine out of ten houses empty will make you unable to bear to look, afraid to think, but what is gratifying is that thirteen million hearts have not grown cold!</p>
<p>In the past, Guangxi's politics were known to be enlightened. Today's environment has changed somewhat, but those who seek a new path for Bagui have not forgotten this goal.</p>
<p>Every Provincial Affairs Meeting Results in Several County Magistrates Being Dismissed</p>
<p>"Resting with the people" is the government's hope and the people's demand. Anyone who dares to disturb the suffering people will eventually suffer the consequences. At every provincial affairs meeting, several county magistrates are inevitably dismissed or removed from office. As a result, on the dilapidated streets of Guilin, new county magistrates, former county magistrates, and those who aspire to be county magistrates are running around, seeking favors, seeking positions, seeking connections. Everyone is trying to "renew" themselves. One civil servant who was dismissed as a county magistrate sighed and said, "This world is truly difficult. A single postage stamp can replace a county magistrate." Indeed, the key points of Guangxi's current administration emphasize that the people must be treated well and the cadres must be treated strictly. Since the province was recovered, every county has changed its local officials. Unfortunately, the people handling affairs in the province have one mindset, but those handling affairs in the counties have a different one. It is difficult to be an official, and it is indeed difficult to find good officials. In less than a year, no fewer than twenty or thirty people have been arrested for corruption and dereliction of duty (Guangxi has only over ninety counties).</p>
<p>The people of Guangxi are helpless, and no one is there to receive their hearts. They are merely comforting themselves. The farmers of southern China are truly docile and are still silently enduring all hardships, unwilling to say more. For example, although recovered areas are exempt from land taxes, some counties (such as Wuming and Tianbao areas) are pretending to be deaf and dumb, collecting the taxes anyway, or establishing another item for collection under the name of warehousing. In the Guidong area, the taxes are so varied and numerous that the people are confused and cry out in distress. Farmers sell their lifeblood—cattle, and pawn all their pitiful property, paying off the taxes and clearing their debts, coupled with their long-standing poverty, so bandits have emerged.</p>
<p>Refugees Receive Emergency Relief Funds, Silently Crying Loudly</p>
<p>Guangxi's public security has always been famously good, which is naturally due to well-trained troops. However, since one major disaster, small disasters have followed one after another like rain during the night. After one major calamity, the entire province received only 50 million yuan in relief funds and received over fifty tons of relief goods. Not to be envious, just the demobilization expenses for Zhejiang University alone are 300 million yuan. What can 50 million yuan really do? Guangxi is truly too tragic! Refugees recently received "a sum" of emergency relief funds, with each person receiving 300 yuan at a time. Today, 300 yuan can buy two pounds of rice, half a pound of beef, or half a pack of cigarettes. Are the refugees, after losing everything, only worth these 300 yuan?</p>
<p>One refugee tore up the banknotes on the spot after receiving the money and cried loudly without saying a word! What else can they say? Of course, we are not saying that the government favors one over the other, but it is a fact that it has not paid attention to the actual situation and understood the suffering in the hearts of the people. What better way should the government come up with to nourish these people living on the brink of death! Only seeing the recovery and prosperity of a few cities is a myopic view. We ask the government to take a look at the rural areas that have not received any agricultural loans or seeds to this day!</p>
<p>Ox-carts Block the Highway, and a Band of Robbers Comes Howling</p>
<p>The withering of production, coupled with the obstruction of transportation, has led to the lack of regulation and formed a ladder of price increases. First, the price of rice rose to cause trouble. The most terrible is the Guixinan area, where the price has risen from over 6,000 yuan to over 15,000 yuan. Guibei has Xiang rice transported to help, and Guidong has Thai rice from Guangzhou, so it still hovers between 12,000 and 13,000, but a large amount of military grain has to be purchased from this arid land, and then there are small profiteers who make trouble from it, so prices are rising rapidly. Gold has passed 140,000, and the worst native cloth costs 400 to 500 yuan a foot. A decent hotel costs 2,000 to 3,000 yuan a night. Traveling is even more of a problem. A short trip from Nanning to Guangzhou cannot be made without 40,000 yuan. The travel expenses from Guilin to Nanning are not much less. Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are all difficult, and today's Guangxi is no longer an ideal paradise. Speaking of the economy, Guangxi indeed has no giants manipulating the market. Small merchants cannot cause big storms, but banks opening gold shops under other names, and a small number of people grasping an "enterprise company that holds the economic reins," looks somewhat unpleasant overall. Recently, merchants have also sent five representatives to Chongqing to request relief, and more requests are following. The mountains and forests of Guixi are originally the refuge of outlaws. Today, due to poverty and hunger, coupled with the instigation of a small group of organized and ambitious people (such as the bandits who invaded the Shiwan Dashan last winter), many useful men have sold their mountains, bought guns, and started doing "murder in the dark of the moon, arson when the wind is high." Whether in rural villages or small towns, the public security force is relatively weak, such as the small counties on the left and right rivers, which are also filled with rumors and on the verge of danger. The mountainous areas are like this, and the plains are no exception. The robbers are most covetous of cars filled with goods and passengers on the highway (without passengers and goods, car tires are also a target, one tire is more than 100,000). The method of robbing cars is truly ingenious: first, block the highway with two large ox-carts to prevent oncoming cars from passing. Then, a band of robbers comes howling, swarming up to loot everything, and the robbers in Guangxi are quite petty, mostly "wanting life first, then money," so cases of murder emerge one after another. Although it cannot be said that robbers are everywhere, they are indeed numerous, keeping the government busy and the security team anxious.</p>
<p>Guangxi Has Always Been Known for Its Poverty, Now It Is Doubly Difficult</p>
<p>Thus, a large-scale clearing campaign is planned, with the county magistrates personally leading the teams to set out, suppressing and appeasing at the same time. Up to today, the effect is naturally not small. In places where it is done well, the area is naturally peaceful. In places where it is not done well, chickens and dogs are chased all over the place. There are countless complaints to the media about the clearing campaign. Clearing is a stopgap measure. The fundamental solution is to carefully look at the shattered rural areas and lend a helping hand to the utterly exhausted farmers. This depends on the government's overall strategy. Here, we might as well take a look at Guangxi's relief work.</p>
<p>To be honest, Guangxi is indeed doubly difficult, and has always been known for its poverty.</p>
<p>A Small Jar of White Rice at Home Is Regarded as a Rare Treasure</p>
<p>To give an example, the farmers in Guixi and Guibei have always been eating corn and sweet potatoes year-round. Occasionally, a more well-to-do family will have a small jar filled with rice. When is this rice eaten? Except for a meal on New Year's Eve every year and a few meals during the Spring Festival, it is simply regarded as a rare treasure. The reporter, after being away from home for a long time, returned home and ate white rice every day. Many people gathered around and curiously looked at me, surprised that I ate rice every meal and not corn. Speaking of which, it is truly both funny and sad. On top of that, the great calamity before the new year left most of the land in eighty-seven counties barren. Housing leaks, commercial loans, requests for repayment of requisitioned materials, how can only farmers need relief?</p>
<p>Difficult to Travel with Water but No Boat, Qian-Gui Road Has Not Been Repaired</p>
<p>Among the merchants' requests is the urgent repair of the Qian-Gui Road. Naturally, the merchants' starting point is to facilitate commercial transport, but in fact, the hurried repair of the Qian-Gui Road and the Xiang-Gui Road (recently jointly referred to as the Xiang-Qian Railway) not only meets the needs of merchants but also addresses the needs of national defense. The existing railways that have been dismantled should be rushed to be restored. How can the roads that were destroyed to resist the enemy be left behind and not repaired? The initial report of the news was: "The Guilin section of the Qian-Gui Road will be repaired by the end of March," and later it was "the construction will be postponed to the beginning of April." In fact, they are waiting for equipment, and a group of employees has been living in Yishan for a long time. Today, transportation in Guixi relies entirely on highways. Guilin, Liuzhou, Nanning, Wuzhou (connected to Rongxu), Qinzhou, Guangzhouwan, and Changsha, all have car intermodal transport. Taking a car is still convenient due to the competition of commercial transport companies, but the fare is a bit expensive, and there is always some danger. The rapid repair and construction of highways is purely the power of the people. The people come as soon as they are conscripted for forced labor, and they work as soon as they come, obedient to the point of being rare.</p>
<p>As for waterway transportation, Guangxi today has plenty of rivers but lacks boats. Except for Wuzhou to Guangzhou, where there are steamers, there are few rotten steamships on the Gui River, Yu River, Liu River, Fu River, and Li River. It is not that there are no boats, just that they have all been pulled to the lower reaches of Guangzhou and Zhao and have not returned.</p>
<p>Lost the Lady and Broke the Soldiers, Striving for Culture</p>
<p>Culture and education are better left unsaid, as it is heartbreaking to talk about them. The "highest institution of learning," National Guangxi University, received over 100,000 yuan in demobilization funds, but before it "recovered" from Guizhou to Guangxi, it was already "finished." It is now taking classes in a row of unsightly houses in Yujiang, Liuzhou, but thousands of children are studying hard. Although books and instruments have been lost or cannot be transported back due to lack of money, it is still considered a national university. The principal is still staying in Chongqing, probably to find some funding. Primary and secondary schools have also resumed classes early, and teachers' salaries are reduced again and again, and there are still arrears, but they are still gritting their teeth and cultivating talents for the country in the 1950s. There are few student movements, and everyone understands and sympathizes with each other.</p>
<p>The number of newspapers and magazines in the province is limited. The Guilin edition and Nanning edition of Guangxi Central Daily News, and the Guilin edition, Liuzhou edition, and Bose edition (recently moved to Nanning) of Guangxi Daily are considered major newspapers. In addition, each county has a daily newspaper, or mimeographed bulletin, mostly hosted by the county party headquarters, with only three or four hundred copies sold. There are quite a few magazines in Guilin like bamboo shoots after a rain, such as Banri Wenhui, Lingbiao Forum, and Construction Monthly, etc. Most are run by Guangxi people and read by Guangxi people. Compared to the previous two years, it is too unbearable to look back. Bookstores and publishing houses are even rarer. One strange thing is that no publications imported from other places have been seen here for more than a year!</p>
<p>"China is the country that has suffered the most severe losses in the world, and Guangxi is the province that has been most thoroughly destroyed in all of China." This statement is not an exaggeration at all. Asking the government to pay attention to this land is also the tearful request of thirteen million people. The sons and daughters of Bagui have contributed money, effort, and lives. Is all that they get in return just 50 million yuan in relief? We believe that the government will not be indifferent, let alone allow Guangxi, the important frontier in the south, to remain desolate! Naturally, striving to overcome the current difficulties is also the responsibility of the sons and daughters of Guangxi themselves!</p>
<h3>Resolving the Shanghai Housing Problem</h3>
<p>— Qiu Hanyun</p>
<p>Shanghai is our nation's gateway, an industrial center, and a hub for international trade. Its population is dense, and the demand for buildings far exceeds the supply, a situation that was already reaching a crisis point before the war. Since Japan's invasion of China, a considerable number of buildings have been destroyed by artillery fire. Furthermore, the destruction of production facilities in the interior, coupled with poor security, has led to an influx of refugees from all directions, who view Shanghai as a promised land. They come with their old and young, like water flowing downwards, further exacerbating the housing problem to an unsustainable degree. The rent for a single house or even a single room is often charged with "black money" amounting to tens or hundreds of taels of gold, making it inaccessible to salaried workers, who can only sigh in despair at the sight of the door. As for the working class, crouching in pigeonholes and huddled in shacks, they have even less hope of improvement. If we wish to resolve this problem, the only solution is to promote large-scale construction, and the primary issue before construction is the utilization of land. If those who aspire to build lack land, and those who possess land are unwilling to build, then this problem will never be solved. Within the city, there are public spaces and private gardens everywhere, creating a stark contrast between the wealthy, who own vast estates, and the poor, who have nowhere to stand. We must rely on the government's efforts, implementing interventionist policies based on the principles of equal land rights, to force construction to meet the needs of the masses. The following steps are suggested for discussion by those who care about social welfare:</p>
<p>Abolish the Racecourse and Convert it into a Residential Area</p>
<p>The racecourse is located in the city center, occupying hundreds of acres of land. It is usually left unused, only serving the Westerners' horse races once or twice a year, with the sole purpose of gambling and accumulating wealth. It is harmful in every way and beneficial in none. Even if it were for practicing horsemanship, the suburbs would suffice. These are all extravagant practices of the Westerners, contrary to our nation's good customs. Now that the concessions have been reclaimed and sovereignty is in our hands, we should abolish it by decree. To meet the public's needs, it should be surveyed, divided, numbered, and open for public bidding, with a deadline for construction. This would increase the number of buildings in the city in a short period. While the relationship between supply and demand may not immediately reach equilibrium, it can be expected to come somewhat closer. Furthermore, the land price obtained from the auction should be designated as a fund for building affordable housing, carefully used to construct the first batch of affordable housing for rent at low prices. The rent should only cover the interest on this fund. Loans should then be taken out from banks to finance the construction of the second batch, continuing the cycle without depletion. After a few years, the Shanghai housing problem should be largely resolved. However, some people advocate converting the racecourse into a public sports field, which is still a Western concept of luxury and fails to consider the welfare of the common people. Weighing the importance of each option, we dare not agree. The racecourse is located in a crucial area, and the auction can yield a large price, sufficient for building affordable housing and regulating the supply and demand relationship, which is equivalent to equalizing land rights for all Shanghai citizens. Public sports fields can be set up in the suburbs, without the need to waste space in the city center.</p>
<p>Investigate Privately Owned Land and Force Construction</p>
<p>According to the Three Principles of the People, privately owned land should not be entirely at one's disposal. Except for sports fields, workplaces, and scenic gardens that can be used for public recreation, the area of a private garden should not exceed the area of its buildings. Any area exceeding the area of its buildings can be considered selfish and harmful to public housing. The government should send honest officials to conduct a clear investigation, define boundaries, and order landowners to build within a certain timeframe. Those who fail to build by the deadline should have their land forcibly acquired by the government to be used as a base for building affordable housing. The compensation for the compulsory acquisition should be paid with the issuance of short-term government bonds. The previously designated construction fund should not be used to avoid affecting the government's construction funds.</p>
<p>Establish Public Surface Rights to Attract Investment</p>
<p>The compulsory acquisition of land will undoubtedly result in a large number of vacant lots available for construction. If the government lacks the financial resources to build on all of it, it should attract citizens who need land and capitalists who are interested in construction to lease the required land. They should be granted the right to build and use it within a certain period (20 to 30 years). After the expiration of the term, the land should be reclaimed by the government to build more affordable housing. This type of legal relationship can be called "public surface rights." Lessees must pay a one-time fee equivalent to the price of the compulsory acquisition as a reserve fund for short-term government bonds used to acquire the land, specifically for paying interest and repaying the principal of these bonds. Lessees will not pay any further land rent during the term. At the end of the term, they can dismantle the buildings and retrieve their materials. The government has no obligation to purchase the buildings or refund the fee paid at the time of leasing.</p>
<p>Investigate Privately Owned Buildings and Force Rental</p>
<p>The housing crisis in Shanghai is a reality. However, there are still many extravagant landlords with surplus houses left unused and greedy landlords demanding "black money" and refusing to rent them out. The government should send honest officials to conduct an on-site investigation and set a deadline for renting them out. After the deadline, the government should introduce tenants, and landlords must not refuse. This intervention will also help to balance the supply and demand relationship.</p>
<p>Establish Housing Referral Centers</p>
<p>Establish housing referral centers according to the methods of employment agencies. Based on the results of the aforementioned investigation, the referral centers should draw up a registry of all houses subject to compulsory rental, inquire about the landlord's minimum rental price, and make a reasonable match based on the registration order of tenants. When registering, tenants should declare the number of family members, the number of rooms needed, and the maximum rent they can afford. After the referral center makes a match, the lease should be directly established, and if there are disagreements on rent, either party may petition the Evaluation Committee to assess it.</p>
<p>Establish a Housing Evaluation Committee</p>
<p>The aforementioned lease must be evaluated before it can be established. There are also many cases where leases have been established for many years, and landlords are demanding increased rent, which the tenants ignore, resulting in a stalemate. A fair evaluation is necessary so that both parties know what to abide by, in order to live in peace. However, while evaluation is not difficult, reasonable evaluation is very difficult. Evaluating too high, causing tenants to struggle to pay, is unkind. Evaluating too low directly exploits the landlord's due profits, and indirectly affects the investor's psychology, making them believe that construction is unprofitable, leading to hesitation, further widening the gap between supply and demand. This is neither a way to encourage construction, nor is it wise. In all fairness, at a time of high prices for all goods, both property owners and those without property feel distressed, so rent cannot but be increased, but "black money" must be prohibited.</p>
<p>The above concerns the welfare of all citizens of Shanghai. We sincerely hope that wise authorities and social elites will act righteously, overcome all difficulties, and unite to address this issue.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Seen Through X-Ray Statistics: A City Riddled with Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>Since the end of the war, there has been a shortage of food and medicine, and tuberculosis has spread to various countries, causing serious attacks. Shanghai is the most populous city in our country, and the prevalence of tuberculosis is much greater than in other cities. Because tuberculosis is an infectious disease, each patient can spread countless infectious seeds. Close relatives and friends are often in contact, and all have the potential to be infected. The more patients there are in a large city, the greater the harm to public health. With dense population and frequent contact, no one can ensure that they will not be infected. X-ray examination can not only allow patients to get early treatment and cut off the source of infection, but also allow people to know how to prevent and avoid infection. It is the most important work to ensure the safety of public health.</p>
<p>To understand the rampant tuberculosis epidemic, a reporter recently visited the host of the Hongqiao Sanatorium. The sanatorium has been working very hard to promote X-ray examinations in recent years. According to the sanatorium's annual examination statistics, a total of 2,435 people were examined, and less than half of them had normal lungs. As many as 626 people suffered from lung disease, accounting for more than 24% of the total, which is alarming. (See X-ray examination statistics table.)</p>
<h3>X-Ray Examination Statistics</h3>
<p>Analysis of the Condition | Number of People out of 2,435 | Percentage</p>
<p>Normal Lungs | 941 | 37.21%</p>

<p>Deep Hilar Lymph Node Shadow | 53 | 2.09%</p>
<p>Enlarged Aortic Shadow | 6 | 0.24%</p>
<p>These statistics are a confirmation of the rampant tuberculosis in this city. Living in this big city, we should be vigilant and deeply realize that this examination is not only for our own benefit, but also for public safety, and should not be ignored.</p>
<p>According to the sanatorium's statistics on the age of tuberculosis patients: the youngest is 2 years old, and the oldest is 19. The next highest are 20 years old and 23 years old, each accounting for 41 people. From 19 to 28 years old is the peak of tuberculosis patients, totaling 369 people, accounting for nearly 60% of the total. It is not unreasonable to call it the most dangerous age of life. We sincerely hope that young people will pay attention to it and not let the golden age be destroyed by tuberculosis. (Chen Ziming)</p>
<p>Special Commentary</p>
<h3>Protesting Against the Soviet Union, Advising the Chinese Communist Party</h3>
<p>— Wang Yaming</p>
<p>The Soviet army in Northeast China broke its promise and failed to withdraw by the agreed date, and is now preparing for a long-term stay. At the same time, the Soviet side has allegedly made "four demands" on us, forcing us to recognize their privileges. The Dongbei faction suddenly proposed so-called autonomous demands, constantly brewing the division and separation of territorial sovereignty. Is Zhang Xinfu's murder any different from Cai Gongshi's assassination? The volley of gunfire that killed many officials in Fanyang is also dissimilar to the artillery fire at Beidaying.</p>
<p>Now, of course, the war has just ended, and all the participating countries, whether victorious or defeated, have only weakened their national strength, not increased it. The dead are dead, and the wounded are wounded. Of course, no country would attempt to start a war. But this very psychology of not wanting to start a war is the best inducement for diplomatic warfare, because the aversion to war can be used to extract more diplomatic gains with "war threats." Now, these countries that are striving to avoid war, both psychologically and behaviorally, are being threatened by countries that are rapidly and aggressively advancing, both in attitude and in action. This is the uneasy reality of the international situation after the war. The tension between China and the Soviet Union over the Northeast issue is a serious part of this international situation. The following four points are elaborated to illustrate our views on this issue.</p>
<p>"Security Needs" and Spheres of Influence</p>
<p>Before international disputes erupt, there must be a subject that generates the dispute. This subject is often the protagonist of the international dispute, that is, the country that is "dissatisfied with the status quo." Before this war, those countries dissatisfied with the status quo shouted the slogan of "redistribution of territory and resources," vying for territory from other countries and creating many international disputes, leading to the outbreak of the world war. Now those countries that shouted a redistribution of territory and resources have been publicly condemned, punished, and regarded as aggressor nations and defeated. Therefore, today's countries dissatisfied with the status quo have a new slogan. They believe that unless they expand outward and establish buffer zones or buffer states outside their borders, or even carve out spheres of influence, they cannot guarantee the security of other countries. They are expanding outward for "security needs." Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov said in his speech commemorating the 28th anniversary of the October Revolution: "We have no task more important than consolidating our victory. This victory was obtained in our unyielding struggle, and it opened a road to a new and great rise of our country and the future improvement of our people's living standards. We have never faced such a vast prospect of socialist construction and the growth of the power of the Soviet Union." The Soviet Union is realistically seizing its unprecedented opportunity, expanding its territorial sovereignty to consolidate the fruits of its victory in order to guarantee its national "security." But when a country's security must be guaranteed by outward expansion, international disputes will arise one after another. The Soviet Union yearns for the "authority of the Tsarist era" and left shadows that harmed international peace in the Yalta Agreement. After the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, they attempted to establish their security line in Northeast China, making Northeast China a buffer zone or even a sphere of influence. But China's security has been shattered, China's territorial sovereignty has been divided, and the issue of China's national survival is involved. The problem is very serious.</p>
<p>"People's Regime" and National Division</p>
<p>The motive for creating international disputes must be a country's "outward expansion." The target of this outward expansion must be a relatively weak country. The way to expand outward is to instigate unrest in the weak country. Stupid behaviors like Japan's direct intervention are, of course, outdated. They can carry out their plans to expand their power amid domestic unrest. The nine eastern provinces of China are also experiencing so-called "people's governments" and "people's armies." What is especially frightening is that there are several people's governments in China, but they cannot form a unified organization among themselves. This is a division within a division. This approach is the same as Japan dividing China into Manchukuo Puyi and Nanjing Wang Jingwei, dividing the occupied areas and the traitorous puppets, and not unifying them, so that they can achieve the purpose of actual control.</p>
<p>War and Peace</p>
<p>After Japan surrendered, Chairman Stalin said: "Now we can believe that our motherland has been freed from the threat of German aggression in the West and the threat of Japanese aggression in the East." For the Soviet Union, whose national strength has expanded unprecedentedly, "eliminating the threat" is not the purpose that the Soviet Union should be satisfied with. What she needs more is "security guarantees." The Soviet Union has three actions to consolidate its victory and seize the opportunity of a thousand years. The first is the annexation of territories such as the Polish Belarusian Soviet, the Czechoslovakian Outer Carpathian Ukraine, the Romanian Moldavia, the Baltic ice-free port of Königsberg, the three Baltic countries claiming Soviet republics, the Finnish Petsamo region, and the incorporation of Japan's South Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands into the Soviet Union, which have already become Soviet territory. The second is the establishment of buffer zones, such as the dabbling in the North Pacific and the dispute over Japan under control, and the conflicts between Greece, Iran, and Britain, which belong to this category. The third is the division of spheres of influence and the establishment of pro-Soviet regimes. The current situation and evolution in Northeast China tend to this goal.</p>
<p>In the author's view, peace and war are not absolute. If it is an indirect conflict of interest, that is, only a dispute over a buffer zone, this can still maintain a considerable balance of concessions, and war will not easily occur. But if it is a direct conflict of interest, or when the "balance" is about to be broken, that is, when the conflict of interest involves spheres of influence and territorial sovereignty, war will suddenly break out. The reason why Britain sacrificed Czechoslovakia in the Munich Agreement and did not break with Germany was that Poland was invaded and decided to declare war on Germany. After the "September 18th Incident," China had to prepare for armed defense, and the Lugouqiao artillery fire launched a full-scale war of resistance. This is the boundary between peace and war. So, is the Northeast issue today likely to become a threat to world peace? I believe that today the Soviet Union has actually swept up Outer Mongolia, and in East Mongolia and Xinjiang, it is also driving the "specialization" movement, which may soon become a Soviet sphere of influence. At that time, whether it is China's protest or international intervention, there is a possibility of triggering a war. To this day, there is no "Munich" gap between peace and war.</p>
<p>Patriotism and "Exclusionism"</p>
<p>Amidst the dark clouds looming over the Northeast situation, the youth of the whole country, moved by righteous indignation, held demonstrations and parades, shouting slogans, demanding that the Soviet Union withdraw its troops from Northeast China, demanding that the Soviet Union respect the integrity of our country's territorial sovereignty, and demanding that all parties abandon their selfish interests, unite as one, and jointly relieve the national crisis. Because of their friendship with the Soviet Union, the Chinese Communists despised this patriotic enthusiasm. They said, "Patriotism and exclusionism must be separated. China should cooperate internationally and not lead China into exclusionist actions. In the past, China mixed patriotism and exclusionism. Today, we hope not to lead patriotic actions to exclusionism." These words seem to say that patriotism must not protest against the Soviet Union, and protesting against the Soviet Union is not patriotism. What she means is that protesting against the Soviet army's failure to withdraw from Northeast China is "anti-Soviet," and "anti-Soviet" is exclusionism. But what is the difference between this and the reason why Japan said that China was "anti-Japanese" eight years ago? Japan used the crime of "anti-Japanese" to suppress the patriotic actions of our people, which eventually led to the "July 7th Incident." Today, our young students are innocent. They still dare not openly echo the memory of being oppressed with the crime of "anti-Japanese." Now we are protesting against the Soviet Union's breach of promise, delayed troop withdrawal, killing of receiving personnel, and removal of Northeast materials. Even the traitors dare not defend this. The CCP actually shamelessly called on young students not to be "exclusionist." Our country certainly needs to cooperate internationally, but can we agree to cooperation that forces us to cooperate with topics such as "economic cooperation" and "joint anti-communism" eight years ago? The CCP did not see the Soviet Union creating China's division, infringing on China's national rights, and seizing China's materials, but saw young students being "exclusionist" and "anti-Soviet," so they regrettably slandered the students' patriotism as "exclusionism." We don't need to study this for the CCP. The CCP has already been in the position of "chief criminal" for the national division movement. It is no different from sincerely appreciating the long-term stationing of the Soviet army. This flattering and wishful thinking is already obvious.</p>
<p>Final Remarks</p>
<p>From the above observations, we can see the seriousness of the Northeast issue, which has already constituted the form of a second "September 18th." If the Soviet Union has no intention of aggression, it should change its course at this time and not treat its allies as objects of power expansion. If the Soviet Union really has an intention of aggression, then before the nine eastern provinces become a defined sphere of influence, it should be stopped. Otherwise, once the situation is created and the Soviet Union's interests are expanded, it will be impossible to stop it. As for the CCP, we also want to urge them to wake up, "Brothers fight outside the wall to defend against insults." Otherwise, even if the CCP can seem to have "succeeded" for a while under the Soviet Union's wings, its pitiful degree is probably no different from Puyi and Wang Jingwei! Therefore, we want to awaken the importance of justice internationally, and to raise the lesson of the failure of Munich. Domestically, we must arouse the spirit of Turkey to correct international actions with aggression through strict diplomacy.</p>
<h3>Designation of Twenty-Seven Banks to Operate Foreign Exchange Business, Meeting Convened Today, Listing to Commence Simultaneously Tomorrow, Foreign Exchange Brokers' Association to Dispatch Representatives to Liaise with the Central Bank for Qualification Application Procedures</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Bank yesterday formally announced that a total of twenty-seven Chinese and foreign banks are designated as "Designated Banks" to operate foreign exchange business in accordance with the "Provisional Measures for Foreign Exchange Management by the Central Bank," and are permitted to display foreign exchange rates. Among the full list, Chinese merchants occupy sixteen positions, and foreign merchants occupy eleven positions. The Chinese merchants include the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, Chung Hsing Bank, Kin Cheng Banking Corporation, Bank of East Asia, The Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Chekiang Industrial Bank, Overseas Chinese Bank, and Kiu Hing Bank. Foreign merchants include American Citibank, Chase Bank, and American Asiatic Underwriters. British HSBC, Mercantile Bank of India, London and China, Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, and David Sassoon &amp; Co., Limited. Russian Moscow Narodny Bank. Dutch Hollandsche Bank-Unie and Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij. Belgian Banque Belge pour l'Etranger.</p>
<p>The above-listed banks will simultaneously commence listing from Monday. They will buy and sell foreign exchange within the scope of the laws and regulations promulgated by the Central Bank and will be free to trade. However, the total amount of their transactions must be reported to the Central Bank each week for record. If the market requires too much and the banks' own funds are insufficient, the Central Bank will provide as much as possible. The Central Bank itself will not list its own rates, with the aim of bringing foreign exchange into the right track and facilitating importers to apply for foreign exchange, so as to develop domestic and foreign trade. Mr. Pei Tsu-yi, President of the Central Bank, will also convene a meeting of the heads of the designated banks at 3:00 PM today at the bank to discuss various relevant matters related to foreign exchange management.</p>
<p>Application for Operating Firms</p>
<p>As for Category A and B foreign exchange operating firms and brokers, applications will begin tomorrow morning. The various application forms are currently being rushed to print by the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank, and are expected to be fully printed tonight. According to estimates from related parties, the number of Category A firms permitted to operate will be as many as forty or fifty. Category B is for travel agencies. According to surveys, only China Travel Service, Lao Keelung Travel Agency, and Huitong Travel Agency are qualified to apply. As for the qualifications of foreign exchange brokers, they are limited to those who operated foreign exchange business before the War of Resistance. The number of quotas will depend on the results of the application review. The applications of Category A and B firms and brokers will be decided by the Examination Department within two or three days after being submitted to the Central Bank. Those who are permitted will be immediately issued a certificate of permission to operate and buy and sell foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Furthermore: The members of the former Foreign Exchange Brokers' Association of this city have now appointed Guo Baoshu, Wei Boxiang, and Sheng as representatives of the members to liaise with the Central Bank to handle the procedures for applying for foreign exchange broker qualifications. It is heard that the association originally had as many as sixty-seven members. With the outbreak of the Pacific War, the association ceased its activities, and now only has more than thirty members, of which Chinese merchants occupy sixteen positions.</p>
<p>Central Bank News: The Business Department of the bank has decided that all cases of foreign exchange settlement at official prices approved by the Foreign Exchange Committee before February 23 of this year will still be allowed to be settled, provided that the applicant completes the settlement procedures with the bank before March 15. Overdue applications will be invalid.</p>

<h3>All Opium Smokers in the City Required to Submit a Pledge of Reform Before the End of This Month</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government, in accordance with the Central Government's measures to eliminate opium in the recovered areas, and using a self-reform approach in conjunction with inspection and reporting methods, instructed the Police Bureau to earnestly and responsibly handle the matter. Those who plant, manufacture, transport, or sell opium are allowed to submit a pledge of reform before the end of March. Those who fail to do so will be sent to the military judicial organs for legal punishment. Those who are addicted to opium are allowed to submit a pledge of reform before the end of March of this year, and must quit opium before the end of June of the same year. Those who fail to do so will be sent to the military judicial organs for legal punishment.

Those who are reported and acknowledge or are verified to be true will be exempt from punishment, but they must pledge to hand over all opium and related utensils to the police station. The rumor that the Neighborhood Chiefs in the various districts of the city will lead the Jia Chiefs to inspect opium smokers and privately stored opium door-to-door and that registration forms should be filled out by each resident and reported to the various district offices is purely a rumor and is not true. Regarding all measures to ban opium, the Police Bureau will completely handle matters in accordance with the law, so that opium smokers can reform themselves and quit their bad habits. The various district offices have never launched a door-to-door inspection of opium smokers.</p>

Securities firms continued to supply at high prices, and the price gradually fell back to 1.41 million. Money exchangers and miscellaneous firms were still absorbing shares. The price rose again at noon, but it was difficult to break through the 1.5 million barrier. In the afternoon, it weakened again, reaching a low of 1.42 million. Finally, it remained above 1.47 million (including some transactions for next week), up 70,000 from the previous close. The Bank of China will use the current market price as the basis for regulation, and the market is expected to fluctuate. Gold jewelry was listed at 150,000 per item, silver at 1,800, and silver dollars at 850 yuan. The hidden interest rate remained at the original price, with a high of 0.25 and a low of 0.18.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market for U.S. dollar notes fluctuated along with the gold market, and the situation has slightly improved. The key still revolved around 710 yuan per ten taels, with the advance and retreat inconsistent. After entry, it remained below the 2,000 yuan mark. Although there was a rebound in the middle, it was temporary, and outsiders found it difficult to sell. Those holding notes continued to panic, and there was once a lack of buyers, causing the selling price to fall to 1,920 yuan. Later, due to the rebound in the gold market, it improved slightly passively. As a result, there was no change from the previous close. The arbitrage price against gold finally widened to 74 yuan per ten taels, indicating that people are looking down on cash. The Hong Kong dollar has stabilized slightly, but transactions were not significant. Old Hong Kong dollar rose to 10 yuan, and new Hong Kong dollar was three yuan higher.</p>
<h3>Securities Weaken</h3>
<p>Government bonds were slightly weaker after being strong. Miscellaneous stocks followed the upward trend. Type C bonds fell from 1,950 yuan in the morning to 1,800 yuan. Many old shares emerged, and small amounts of surplus funds from silver and money companies were still being absorbed. As a result, they closed slightly higher than the previous close. Type A, B, and D each rose by 80 yuan, and Type E rose by 50 yuan. Chinese stocks continued to advance on the exchange, but because trading was not active and lacked transparency, those taking profits sold at high prices, and credit tightened. After being strong, they weakened. Yong Yarn was the strongest at 2,900 yuan, Meiya at 2,300 yuan, and Jingfu above 140 yuan, but they fell back by 10% at noon. Compared to the previous close, Yong Yarn fell by 50 yuan, Meiya by 70 yuan, and Jingfu by 5 yuan. Foreign stocks also followed the same downward trend as Chinese stocks. Yisha was marked down 10% from 6,500 yuan. Other stocks also struggled, resulting in large stocks falling by half a percent and small stocks falling by more than 10% compared to the previous close.</p>

<h3>Rice Prices Continue to Rise Due to Rainy Weather Affecting Supply; Oil, Soybean Cake Also Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market saw a reduction in supply due to continuous rain. Vendors and firms still had shares, which caused prices to rise by more than 1,000 yuan. After continuous weakness, oil prices recovered with a brisk digestive rate, rebounding by 2-3,000 yuan. Soybean cake also rose by 1-200 yuan. High-quality yellow soybeans were steady, while medium-quality yellow soybeans rose by 1,000 yuan. Flour prices declined slightly by 2-300 yuan because the digestive rate had decreased, and the intake from out-of-town firms had stopped. Hide and leather remained sluggish, and prices continued to fall by 1-200 yuan, indicating a weak trend.</p>
<h3>Silk Trade Becomes More Active</h3>
<p>Recently, silk has resurfaced, and although credit is tight, transactions are still decent. Yesterday, high-grade raw silk was priced similarly to the previous day. In the afternoon, ordinary five-dan raw silk changed hands at 2.7 million yuan. Other lots were priced higher than the previous day. 120-count Rayon from Tianqiao opened at 1.82 million yuan and continued to rise to 845,000 yuan, closing at 1.9 million yuan, 100,000 yuan higher than the previous day. The silk market was very active, with frequent transactions, causing prices to rise across the board. Meiya was listed at 1.3 million yuan per 100 threads. Dage Bige opened at 4,000 yuan per yard and later traded at 4,200 yuan. Minsheng Brocade was 17,500 yuan per piece, and Linji yarn was 20 yuan per yard.</p>
<h3>Abundant Supply Causes Wen Hong Tea Prices to Fall; Other Teas Remain Steady</h3>
<p>The Wenzhou Jordan-brand black tea that arrived a few days ago has been in contact with the client-side, but the spot market has been inundated with supply, forcing prices to decline sharply, falling by as much as 4-5,000 yuan compared to before. Other varieties continue to be discussed between supply and demand, so trading remains limited, and prices remain stable. As for Fujian tea, it is reported that a considerable amount of red and green scented tea will be shipped to Shanghai within days.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Fluctuates; Spot Cotton Trading is Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market saw some buying interest due to the large decline the previous day. Gold prices rebounded, and yarn prices stabilized. 20-count yarn rose back above the 1 million mark, with the final transaction at 1.02 million, an increase of about 60,000 yuan from yesterday. Other counts also rose by about 3-40,000 yuan. Confidence is still lacking, and the yarn market appears to be in a fluctuating state. The Fangjian Company is selling various colors of flannel blankets at flat prices. It is reported that in addition to opening sales of cotton yarn next Monday, a large amount of cotton cloth will also be sold.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market saw little activity, but Fangjian did inquire about 200 bales of Texas American cotton from Hong Kong and the price was set at 41 U.S. dollars. In addition, small private yarn factories traded Brazilian cotton and Sanyu Zhen cotton at 90,000 yuan, and the industry traded Zhoupu seed cotton at 15,500 yuan. Market prices were generally flat and sluggish.</p>
<h3>Women's Fabric Sells Well</h3>
<p>Women's fabrics continue to sell well. First-grade fabrics wholesale for 15-6,000 yuan per yard, second-grade fabrics are around 10,000 yuan, and third-grade fabrics are 6-7,000 yuan. Both buyers and sellers are benefiting from low capital requirements and good profits, so they are eager to sell them. Factories have realized this, and due to raw material costs, they are producing more women's fabrics than fine wool fabrics.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Woolen Fabric Trade Association has been reorganized and notified all member shops to attend a general meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce in Tianhou Temple next Wednesday to elect directors and supervisors.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil for Export Valued at 80,000 per Load</h3>
<p>Tung oil has an export route, so those involved are very attentive. However, the delay in announcing foreign exchange rates has led everyone to adopt a wait-and-see attitude. It is recently reported that the foreign exchange rate will be announced soon, and interest is growing. Those who can match export sales have already valued it at 80,000 per load in the Shanghai market, while domestic sales require 76-7,000 yuan. Since the arrival of Hongjiang Tung Oil from Western Sichuan, the situation has changed. Local manufacturers know they cannot compete and will have to close down. The supply of Huaixi Hongjiang Tung Oil is also limited, so although each company has set the wholesale price at 60,000 yuan per barrel, they are unwilling to sell too much.</p>
<h3>Sugar, Tea, and Fruit Shipped in Large Quantities from Taiwan</h3>
<p>The Taipei, a ship chartered by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, arrived from Keelung on the previous day (the 1st), carrying over 37,140 bags of sugar, over 2,000 pieces of tea, over 3,000 pieces of oranges and bananas, and a total of over 58,200 pieces of miscellaneous goods.

<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Sugar: Four and a half cars of white sugar sold for 87,000 yuan, and three and a half cars sold for 76,500 yuan. The price of medium sugar was relatively flat, opening at 50,000, and was actually sold for 51,000. There were no transactions for Qing sugar.</p>
<p>Top-grade longan pulp has recently arrived in limited quantities. Grade is priced at 115,000 yuan to 130,000 yuan, which is slightly tighter than before.</p>
<p>The timber market was stable yesterday. Supply and demand were equal. It is reported that sawmill workers have resumed work and can supply the market as usual.</p>

<p>Industrial raw materials: Due to reports that 600 Shun of soda ash had arrived in Shanghai, holders were eager to sell, and prices fell all the way down. Other raw materials were dragged down, and transactions remained limited.</p>
<p>Due to the continuous rain in Shanghai in recent days, the prices of various rubber shoes have increased by more than double.</p>
<h3>Economic Briefs</h3>
<p>The Shanghai coal market has recently experienced considerable chaos. It has been learned that the authorities have instructed the industry association to cease all illegal transactions, or they will face legal sanctions if discovered. The association has issued a notice to all members to comply.</p>
<p>It is rumored that Sun Chaoju, Director of the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, and Shi Shouchang, Director of the Jiangsu Direct Tax Bureau, will soon be exchanged. The Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau on Dihua Road is currently rushing to complete the handover, and work is very busy.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau has begun to implement property leasing and sales income tax. All warehouses, sales or leases of production equipment, and buildings must be reported in accordance with the law, and income tax must be withheld. It is reported that rent for buildings exceeding 3,000 yuan must be withheld. The bureau has now sent personnel to the Jing'an Temple district to investigate rental income from November 1st to December 31st of last year.</p>
<p>Wuxi is known as a silk and rice producing area. Since the beginning of spring, farmers have been preparing to raise silkworms on a large scale, but they are lacking high-quality silkworm eggs, causing prices to soar. The local sericulture production and sales cooperative has requested the county government to forward a request to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction and the Jiangsu Agricultural Cooperative Bank to allocate reasonably priced silkworm eggs to provide relief.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau has reported that from October 21, 1945, to February 28 of this year, Shanghai's total revenue from stamp duty was 1,076,451,465.00 yuan. These stamp duty tickets were sold by the Central, China, Communications, and Agricultural Banks and the Postal Savings Bureau.</p>

As of February 26 of this year, 1,076,311,778.099 yuan had been paid into the treasury, leaving a shortfall of 214,524,941.89 yuan. It is reported that this winter business tax will not be fully collected until April of this year.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the Shanghai Unemployment Relief Committee of the Ministry of Social Affairs, the initial number of unemployed workers receiving relief was 125,550. Currently, only over 70,000 people are receiving relief flour, indicating that the others have found employment.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's exchange of counterfeit Central Reserve Certificates (Zhongchu Sha) has been extremely crowded recently since it began last November. It is rumored that the deadline will need to be extended. The Dagon Society has learned that this is not true, but the exchange procedures will be improved.</p>
<h3>South America Needs Chinese Tea: Tea Merchants Are Rushing to Produce</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Chinese tea exports from Shanghai have almost come to a standstill since the outbreak of the Pacific War. Since the victory, there have been increasing inquiries from overseas. However, due to the lack of smooth shipping and the uncertain exchange rate, there have been few large shipments. Now that the authorities are expected to announce the foreign exchange rate soon, inquiries from Europe, America, and other countries are becoming more enthusiastic. South America has requested tea samples and is preparing to place orders. Although some tea merchants in Shanghai are rushing to produce, their stockpiles are very depleted, so it will be difficult to develop. It is expected that the future of Chinese tea exports will be promising when the new tea season begins.</p>
<h3>Entire Faculty of Jiaotong University Appeals for Improved Treatment, Sends Telegram to Chairman Chiang, President Soong, and Minister Zhu Requesting Resolution or Forced Retirement</h3>
<p>[Local News] The entire faculty of National Jiaotong University, in an appeal to demand improved treatment, specifically telegraphed Chairman Chiang, the Second Plenary Session, President Soong, and Education Minister Zhu, stating: "To Chairman Chiang of the Nationalist Government, the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, President Soong of the Executive Yuan, and Minister Zhu of Education: The treatment of professors at national universities is indeed meager, and their living conditions are exceptionally difficult during the war. They have endured and persevered. Now that the war of resistance has been won and reconstruction is underway, in this age of atomic energy, everything depends on science. The responsibility of higher education is therefore particularly significant. The Chairman has also repeatedly emphasized the importance of education. However, the monthly income of professors is only two-thirds that of laborers at national banks. Other business institutions provide various forms of subsidies to improve living conditions, such as additional meals, extra months of pay, or cost-of-living allowances. Even civil servants, who are also public employees, often receive benefits in kind. Professors, however, only receive a meager monthly income in legal tender. We do not consider the treatment of other professions to be excessively high and in need of reduction. In fact, such higher treatment is somewhat more reasonable. However, the treatment of professors in our country is excessively unreasonable. It is a common practice in all countries to treat professors well, and their income is invariably among the highest in the nation. In the United States, professors' salaries are determined by the professors themselves. Countries like the Soviet Union and Germany, mindful of the significant mission they bear, provide ample support. We sincerely appeal for improvement because our income is truly insufficient to cover our expenses and we cannot continue to make ends meet. Therefore, we urge a practical solution within the month of March, otherwise, we will be forced to collectively abandon teaching and seek alternative employment. This urgent telegram conveys our pressing situation. Respectfully, the Faculty Association of National Jiaotong University." Attached are suggestions for improving treatment: (1) Multiply the first one hundred yuan of salary by the cost-of-living index. (2) For every fifty yuan above one hundred yuan, multiply by a certain percentage of the cost-of-living index, making it progressively reduced.</p>
<p>Middle School Teachers Telegram for Relief</p>
<p>More than forty representatives of municipal middle school teachers and staff held a meeting yesterday (the 2nd) at Gezhi Middle School on Shanhai Pass Road. The chairman's committee reported on previous appeals to the municipal government. They were received by Shen Shihua, representing Mayor Qian, but the results were unsatisfactory. Therefore, they have telegraphed the Second Plenary Session in Chongqing requesting relief. Otherwise, they will take practical action and have already organized the Municipal Middle School Teachers and Staff Association.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Secondary Schools to Increase Instruction in Constitutionalism</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Chongqing] The Ministry of Education, considering that the current government is practicing democracy and that it is necessary to increase the constitutional knowledge and abilities of students in higher and secondary schools, has formulated specific measures. For example, the portion of the curriculum related to constitutional law in the civics course standards for senior middle schools and normal schools should be taught in greater detail, and supplementary teaching materials related to the constitution should be added appropriately. The Ministry of Education has issued an order to all provinces and cities to implement the above decision uniformly.</p>
<h3>Beijing and Shanghai Promote Broadcast Education</h3>

Beijing and Shanghai are taking the lead, and then the program will be gradually promoted throughout the country. ()</p>

<p>[Local News] To prevent private schools from arbitrarily suspending operations and dismissing teachers without cause, the Municipal Education Bureau issued a special order yesterday instructing all private schools to pay attention.

If there are difficulties, measures for relief can be prepared in advance. Furthermore, the positions of teachers and staff are protected by law and must not be terminated without cause. Besides disseminating this order, we hereby instruct you to comply. Any deliberate violation will be dealt with according to law."</p>
<h3>Deputy Minister Zhu of Education Flies to Chongqing, Deputy Minister Hang to Come to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing] Deputy Minister of Education Zhu Jingnong will fly from Nanjing to Chongqing on March 1st to attend the Second Plenary Session and report to the Minister on the key educational policies implemented in the ten provinces and cities under his jurisdiction.

<h3>Decision to Change to National Status, Zhu Guang Appointed Preparation Director</h3>
<p>[Dahua News Agency, Chongqing] The Executive Yuan has decided to change Anhui Provincial Anhui University to national status and plans to restore the school in its original location. Preparatory personnel have been appointed. Zhu Guang has been appointed as the Director of the Preparatory Committee, and Tao Yinmin has been appointed as the Committee Member and Secretary. Many other committee members are also senior educators from Anhui.

It is said that the people of Anhui are generally pleased that someone capable is in charge of higher education.</p>
<h3>Capital Temporary University Student Case: Prosecutor Proposes Suspended Sentence, Debate Concludes, Verdict on March 6th</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing] The eight student representatives involved in the Capital Temporary University disturbance have been released on bail. The investigative court was held ten days ago and the investigation of the facts has been completed. On the afternoon of February 27th, at 2:00 PM, the Capital District Court held a debate. Three judges, one prosecutor, one clerk, and eight defense lawyers for the defendants were present. Four hundred people attended the hearing. The court session opened at 2:30 PM and adjourned at 9:00 PM. The judges charged the students with gathering to threaten, obstructing official duties, and obstructing freedom. The students stated the circumstances of the day, and the lawyers defended them, arguing that they did not obstruct Wang's official duties at the time and that Wang went to the Ministry of Education voluntarily, not under the students' threats, ultimately arguing that they were not guilty. However, the judges examined the actual circumstances at the time of the incident and the results of the investigation and still intended to pursue legal action. After a lengthy debate, the prosecutor stood up and suggested that the students were completely driven by their desire for academic pursuits and that the unfortunate incident, although a transgression, was motivated by pure intentions and had no other purpose, which was excusable. He requested that the presiding judge invoke the relevant provisions of the criminal law to grant a suspended sentence. After further debate by the lawyers, the presiding judge announced the conclusion of the debate, adjourned the court, and scheduled the verdict for March 6th. According to general observation, if the students are found guilty but given a suspended sentence, the students will be nominally subject to criminal restrictions, and they will be deprived of their civil rights and unable to participate in elections during the term of the sentence. However, since the sentence is suspended, the criminal sentence will not be executed, and they will still be free to study, which is desirable for both sides in terms of human feelings and legal principles.</p>
<h3>Students from Vocational Schools in Recovered Areas May Participate in Judicial Examinations, But Must Pass Screening</h3>
<p>[Ta Kung Pao News Agency, Local] The first higher examination for judicial personnel after the victory has been scheduled to take place simultaneously in twelve locations, including this city, on April 1st of this year.

<h3>Communist Party Plans to Establish Northern University in Handan, Southern Hebei</h3>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 2nd] The Communist Party is establishing a new university in Handan, Southern Hebei, called Northern University. The president is Fang Wanlun, a scholar of classical texts for thirty-two years. He graduated from Peking University in 1917 and has served as a professor at Peking University and Sino-French University. Fang plans to combine academic research with practical application at Northern University. Fang told a United Press reporter at the Communist Party headquarters in Beiping that the Communist Party does not advocate abandoning the Four Books and Five Classics, contrary to general rumors. In fact, the Communist Party also pays close attention to the classics in order to discover the meaning of China's current and future development. Northern University will not only conduct scientific research using scientific methods, but will also be complemented by practical experience and application. Students and professors must spend half of their time acquiring practical knowledge and experience in the subjects they are studying, so as to keep up with the ever-changing scientific inventions. In recent years, science and industry have made rapid progress, and China must catch up in order to join the ranks of strong nations. The school will take a completely detached attitude towards the political views of students and professors, as truly progressive education must first have absolute freedom in politics and personal thought. The school intends to embrace both communist and nationalist social organizations, and students and professors who believe in communism may live according to the communist distribution system. Currently, more than 700 students have registered, and ten professors have been hired, but the opening date has not yet been determined. The school is organized into three levels: (1) preparatory courses, so that secondary school students who have not graduated due to living movements in the past few years can make up for it, (2) four-year undergraduate programs, and (3) graduate schools.</p>

<h3>Brief News</h3>

The Rehabilitation Committee has decided to organize an Educational Donation Committee to raise 50 million yuan for the rescue of Jiangyin's education.</p>

<h3>National Education and Local Self-Government</h3>
<p>— Lu Guanliu</p>
<p>In local self-government work, in addition to organizing security and public health, the most important thing is to promote national education. Therefore, there is a cultural education section in the organization of the administrative region to preside over education work, which shows that the responsible persons of each district have the obligation to promote national education. There are more detailed regulations in the new county system, and the government's performance in national education in each district is set as one of the criteria for assessment, because local self-government and national education are the basic works of our country. In places where local self-government work is completed, the implementation of national education is easy to have good results. In places where national education is developed, local self-government work is also easy to carry out. The two complement each other and are inseparable.</p>
<p>Now that the administrative districts of this city have been established one after another, and the household survey is coming to an end, most of the district chiefs have taken the reorganization of security and the promotion of education as their responsibility after taking office, which is really a good phenomenon. Although the national education work in many districts is now being actively promoted, there are still a few district government personnel who do not know where to start in promoting national education, so there are no corresponding achievements yet.</p>
<p>(1) During the household survey, the number of literate people and the number of out-of-school people should be surveyed at the same time. How many middle school students are there in this district? How many out-of-school adults are there? These should be surveyed clearly one by one. On the one hand, it can clarify the education situation in this district, and on the other hand, it can be used to prepare for the implementation of national education, so that the illiteracy in this district will be completely eliminated one day.</p>
<p>(2) In addition to the household survey, attention should also be paid to the school survey. How many schools are there in this district? Can the number of schools in this district meet the actual needs? If there are too few schools, then ways should be found to increase them. How is the distribution of schools? If the distribution is uneven, ways should be found to adjust it.</p>
<p>(3) The public land and public property in this district should also be surveyed. Because there must be public land and temple houses to run schools; there must be public property and public funds to have school funds. This is also very important for the development of national education.</p>
<p>(4) National schools are also called public schools. The source of funds, in addition to government appropriations, should also be raised automatically by local people. Therefore, the person in charge of the district office should try to promote enthusiastic education and public welfare people in this district to organize a National Education Funding Committee to serve as the funds for national education in this district, and must raise funds for the expansion of equipment.</p>
<p>(5) There is also the obligation to supervise and guide the schools that have been run in this district, because the quality of the schools has a great relationship with the future of the educated children. Therefore, schools that are run seriously and have excellent results should be encouraged, and schools that are run poorly should also be corrected. At the same time, we should cooperate in promoting the work of educational research in this district, so that the progress of education in this district can be rapid.</p>
<p>Education is the most important department in the work of national construction. It is very important for the career of individual children and the future of the country and society. It is hoped that those in charge of local self-government will pay attention to it actively, strive to improve it, and determine a plan to implement it in stages, so that the education business can have a day of rapid progress.</p>

<h3>Football Postponed, Basketball As Usual: Three Games Tonight</h3>
<p>The fine rain all day long made it impossible for the football league to proceed, thus this week's ball game has become a desolate situation. Fortunately, the basketball game can be held as usual, which is a consolation. There will still be three games in the stadium ball room on South Shaanxi Road starting at 5:30 this afternoon. The women's V Team will compete with Qinglian, the second division A will be Ren Yu vs. V Team, and the last game of the first division A will be Jiangwan vs. Blue Team. Although the three games are not the most exciting, the strengths of each team are similar, and there is hope for a fierce battle at that time.</p>
<p>The women's V Team has won three of the five games in the league, while Qinglian has won two of the five games, and the results are close. This game is related to the fourth seat, and Xu Peizhen, the former record of Qinglian, has made rapid progress and has good prospects. If she can play well today, the V Team will be greatly threatened.</p>
<p>Ren Yu and V Team, the former has the ambition to win the championship, while the latter has lost all five games. The hope of winning is indeed Ren Yu, and the spirit of resistance of the V Team, the score will never be too far behind.</p>
<p>Jiangwan meets the Blue Team, Jiangwan team is in the league, it is difficult to take care of things at the same time, and once suffered a poisonous hand from the Shan team, and the battle with Tengke was also judged as a change, so there are currently two losses on record, and the strength is difficult to beat the Blue Team, there will also be a fierce battle. The order of the three games is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>V Team—Qinglian (Women's Group) 5:30 PM Ren Yu—V Team (Second Division A) 6:15 PM Jiangwan—Blue Team (First Division A) 7:15 PM</p>

<h3>The Problem of Writers' Livelihoods</h3>
<p>— Tang Shaohua</p>
<p>The issue of improving the livelihoods of writers has been raised by many and has attracted some attention from society. Theater and film writers can originally be considered as a part of the writers' circle, so rather than discussing the issue of theater and film writers' livelihoods alone, it is better to discuss the livelihoods of writers more broadly. Indeed, writers in society are known as "intellectuals" or "cultural figures," but the hardship of their lives is beyond description. They bury themselves in their desks all day, gripping their pens tightly, racking their brains, but can only write a few thousand words. If "writing is hated by fate" and they are rejected everywhere, the whole family will starve. Or if they are fortunate enough to be adopted, how many liters of rice can the royalties they receive buy? Therefore, society should pay attention to the issue of writers' livelihoods. To put it more bluntly, the fate of writers has now reached the dividing line between life and death!</p>
<p>Furthermore, culture is the soul of society, and writers are the supporters of this soul. We cannot allow writers' lives to fall into hardship, even to the point where they can hardly sustain themselves. Therefore, we should support improving writers' livelihoods. In addition, the respect for writers and the value of their works are equally important issues. At the same time, a writer should stand on their own post, exert all their abilities, and take on the task of promoting social culture and enlightening civilized thought. During the period of national reconstruction today, they should also promote the principles of national and ethnic revival and reconstruction for the country and the nation, and awaken the whole people to jointly save the national destiny. Especially important is that they should have a spirit of great fearlessness, able to achieve the transcendent and unique will of "being incorruptible by wealth and status, unyielding in poverty, and unbowed by force." In order to be loyal to their own tasks, they must sacrifice the individual for the benefit of the whole, placing their own welfare below the welfare of the masses. The writer's pen must become the vanguard of the masses, or the helmsman who promotes society. No matter how harsh the environment or how violent the abduction, they must resolutely and stubbornly carry out their own work, to show the true color of talent and the noble personality of a writer. Therefore, the issue of improving writers' livelihoods will not affect the spirit that writers should have.</p>
<p>However, many people who claim to be writers now have actually forgotten their own tasks and duties, and are good at flaunting their integrity. They only talk about flowers and the moon, and never talk about world affairs. Even worse, they become megaphones or echo bugs, confusing black and white, distorting right and wrong, and using their identity as writers to put up the signboard of "progress," "freedom," and "democracy" to slander the authorities or lure young people to a path of depravity. Then, are such writers worth improving their livelihoods? — And their lives may be more luxurious than ordinary people — I would like to tell my dear writers that if you want to take on the task of promoting social culture, you must first abandon those wild ideas, stand on the position of the country above all else, the nation above all else, explore the truth, build a new culture, and then discuss improving your lives. Only then will you not be putting the cart before the horse!</p>
<h3>The Artistic Creation of Actors</h3>
<p>— Yin Yan</p>
<p>Although China's theatrical art has passed its infancy, it is still quite far from reaching maturity. To be precise, Chinese theatrical art is still learning to walk and has not yet been able to stand firmly. It cannot be denied that our theater has produced many excellent actors in recent years. However, the fact is that most of these excellent actors are groping around with their natural talent. The rigorous experience and knowledge they have gained are inevitably too fragmented and too abstract. And I believe that the problems that actors must study at present should be more concrete and fundamental.</p>
<p>At this stage, the artistic creation of actors seems to be stuck in the imitation of general human nature. In the performances we see at present, the characters created by the actors generally feel very thin, and few can create archetypes. Generally speaking, perhaps it is because life is not rich enough. On the other hand, I think it is because they have not grasped the diversity and complexity of human life forms. The grasp of a character's personality should emphasize the principle of originating internally and manifesting externally.</p>
<p>Actors in artistic creation often fail to integrate the materials extracted from life, and instead use fragmented materials as the basis for imitation. However, the creation of an archetype is by no means based solely on the imitation of a very small number of people in real life, but rather on our correct artistic understanding, refining the most concrete forms of various qualities from many people and integrating them. To put it clearly, we are prone to directly imitating fragments of life and calling this realistic imitation art. I think this judgment is wrong. Sculptor W.W. Story said, "Art becomes art because it is not nature—so the most perfect imitation of nature cannot be considered art. Art is a mirror of the spirit, and the nature reflected in it carries various emotions from the spirit." Famous painter J. La Farge put it more succinctly: "Art is the world in the artist's eye." Poet Goethe also said: "The only reason why a work of art is allowed to exist is that it is different from nature." In summary, all works called art are by no means a simple imitation of the object. We should not forget the "role of the heart." We should imitate the images that are awakened by the object in our hearts and tailored.</p>
<p>So, what is the criterion for the artistic creation of actors? Aristotle said it well: "The creation of the highest art not only appeals to emotion, but also to reason." The harmony of emotion and reason is the criterion for our artistic creation of actors. Air Henry Irving also said: "The actor should fully express the thoughts and emotions created by the poet, and to achieve this, he must fully understand these thoughts and emotions." Another is the experienced French dramatist B.C. Coquelin, who emphasized practice. He said: "What becomes the art of acting is the creation of that living archetype, which is the most humane of all arts, therefore I think that is art, in other words, that is the blending of the 'poetic' charm and the 'ideal' image in the expression of reason." In summary, poetry and philosophy are the sources of all art, and the artistic creation of actors is also based on and promotes poetry and philosophy.</p>
<p>"Poetry" can help actors create imagination, and "imagination" is the actor's greatest asset. Without imagination, there is no creation. When an actor is dealing with his character, he should learn from the poet in dealing with his material; concentrate his thoughts on a specific aspect of life. Following the concentration of thought, a kind of emotion is immediately aroused, and at the same time many images are gathered. Under the excitement of these emotions, the images are gradually brightened up by means of synthesis, and definite forms are obtained to simulate the various colors of life. These images are governed by our will, and aided by the inspiration of virtue and talent. In this way, the artistic creation of actors will gradually become appropriate and enriched.</p>
<p>Philosophy seems at first glance to have no deep connection with the artistic creation of actors, but in fact, drama is the expression of life, and actors must naturally understand life. To understand it, they must start with philosophy. The connotation of life is complex and diverse. It is the confluence of various human wills and the crystallization of history and environment. If we want to explore its essence, we must find perfect tools, and philosophy is the most ideal tool. At the same time, the significance of our drama is not only in expressing life, but also in indicating the way of life; in depth, our task is not only to interpret the world, but also to change the world. What is the right path? Only philosophy can help us find it.</p>
<p>Philosophy helps us grasp the theme and create archetypes. It enables us to determine the character's outlook on life, and this understanding of the outlook on life is the solid backbone of building archetypes.</p>
<p>From another perspective, art of the highest value must contain a kind of "eternal will," which is the soul of beauty, the highest expression and joy of the artist's life. Painting uses canvas, music uses music, and literature uses words to convey its "eternal will." But our art of actors is limited by time and almost loses its "eternal will." More clearly, sculpture and architecture resist time with their own presence and express their indelible "eternal will." But our art of actors is limited by time and almost loses its "eternal will." However, if we lose it, how empty will our hard-working artistic creators be! Then how will we capture the eternal will that will be swept away by time? The eternal will of our acting art is the truth we express. It lives forever in humanity, with its stubborn will, impressing the hearts of tens of thousands of viewers. They will use it to transform the world, improve life, and give direct influence to history, so that future generations will benefit from it and pass it on to infinity. Therefore, we must further study philosophy and explore the truth in order to transmit the "eternal will" of our artistic creation.</p>
<p>In summary, actors should learn from poetry and philosophy. They can make our artistic creation more substantial and rich. Poetry is the blood and flesh of our artistic creation, and philosophy is the backbone of our artistic creation. They can make our theatrical art stand more firmly.</p>
<h3>About Historical Films</h3>
<p>— Lai Ming</p>
<p>There have been many works containing historical elements in films, but the significance contained in each historical film work varies greatly due to the differences in each period. If we examine it closely, we can explore the differences in historical films in each period.</p>
<p>Today, historical films are appearing one after another in China and abroad. As for historical films in our country, the materials are especially rich, because there are thousands of years of history, which is enough for the historical facts needed in films. However, there is a great lack of relatively true historical films in our country. One reason is of course the lack of talent, and the other is that the knowledge of our people is relatively shallow. For example, the film "Confucius" in the past, although it was a historical film very suitable for scholars, could not be understood by most audiences, which is a very obvious example. The country with the most historical films should be Germany in the past. After the First World War, Germany declined to the extreme, and the people sought historical films that contained romance, that is, romance novels. This was the historical film of that period. After the Nazis seized power, the film was inevitably stained with the heroic color of the Nazis as a propaganda goal, and it was also used as education for the people to be mixed up. Secondly, the Soviet Union, which was the first country to nationalize films, also used the glorious historical films of socialism to encourage the people. As for the number of historical films in the United States, it has long been famous in various countries around the world.</p>
<p>However, historical films must be infected by criticism. In order to stand at the forefront of correcting historical factual errors, we must examine its skewed propaganda to prevent the intrusion of fake historical films into the audience.</p>
<h3>The Origin of the March 3rd Friends' Day</h3>
<p>— Yong Wang</p>
<p>It is said, "At home, rely on parents; when out, rely on friends." This shows that friends are very important. I hereby suggest that the central government stipulate that March 3rd of each year be "Friends' Day" to arouse the people's attention to the way of making friends, how to make friends, what kind of friends to make, and how to treat friends. The purpose and methods are briefly described below, hoping that people from all walks of life will cooperate to promote it and give corrections. (1) Purpose: Everyone feels that human beings need mutual assistance and cooperation. The current society needs to revive morality. Launching "Friends' Day" is to make compatriots across the country speak of integrity, value morality, and keep promises, especially among friends. Everyone should cooperate and help each other, promote the movement of good etiquette, make good friends, be loyal to friends, and should be responsible for persuading friends if they have improper behavior, and should help sick friends. (2) Methods: On "March 3rd Friends' Day," newspapers publish special issues or more articles about making friends, various groups hold symposiums; schools hold lectures and recreational activities; families hold dinner parties or tea parties; individuals write to friends at home and abroad, reporting on their recent situations, or discussing academics and careers, or sending letters of greetings. "March 3rd Friends' Day" is promoted uniformly across the country, carrying out friend-benefiting undertakings, cultivating good friendship between friends, and carrying out public welfare and charitable undertakings for the country and society.</p>
