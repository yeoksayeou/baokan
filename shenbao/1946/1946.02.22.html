<h3 id="c15">專論　門戶開放與現階段的中國均勢（續昨） <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— 施志剛</p>
<p>三　美國對中國的關心</p>
<p>由於近來局勢的斷淡，美國對中國已日漸關心起來。我們可以說，美國關心中國不自今日始，不過近來的趨勢更爲明朋罷了。華盛頓宣佈雅爾泰協定之後，輿論譁然。雅爾泰協定第二條明白指出「蘇聯應恢復以前俄羅斯帝國之權利，因一九〇四年日本之詭譎攻擊而受破壞」，同時，美報於該協定宣佈後，一致批評，特別關切蘇聯在我國東北之情形。如「紐的先驅論暨報一二月十二日社評：</p>
<p>「蘇聯參加太平洋的代價是在雅爾泰協定中規定的。一般對於雅爾泰協定，雖有若十的批評，可是蘇聯倘能遵守然諾，尊東中國的主權，這也是未楞厚非的一件事：倘使蘇聯在精神和文字上，都能够堅定地遵守它底諾言，來維持中國的主權，那麼一切都是很好。不過，近月以來，在東九省地方的軍事官長的行動，還有些未盡如人意。有時中國的官員幷沒有得到適當的待遇。大宗的食糧和機器被遷走了，有若干軍械精良的地方軍隊，現在勢力頗爲膨脹。還有所謂的獨立運動也出現了。美國對於維持中國領土（包括東九省在內）的完整，具有重大的關切。過去　十年來，美國曾經反對一個外國來統治中國任何部份的每一企圖。因爲上述的原因所以蘇聯將來對東九省的行動，將成爲美蘇關係展望或好或壞的一個最佳試騐」。</p>
<p>正因爲美國不放心「蘇聯這樣，一個强大的國家」，所以要「反對一個外國來統治中國任何部份」。而表現爲重申「門戶開放」政策，維持中國領土主權完整。</p>
<p>從這裘我們可以得到一個概念：英美爲了减少對日作戰中自己的犧牲，所以遷就蘇聯，慷他人之慨。寗可出諸事後的追悔。就在日宼剛剛投降，全世界民主國家的人民給勝利衝昏了頭腦的時候，已早有人冷酷地提出來了。（如本埠密勒氏評論報鮑威爾等的言論，美國至今方纔看重。）</p>
<p>「紐約先驅論壇報」二月七日社評也說：「……雖然美國商人的利益必須老獻，但是美國在東九省的基本願望，應該是維持中國領土完整的傳統勢力。東九省在種族上語言上與文化上都是中國的，不是蘇聯的。對於中蘇兩國在東九省的正常經濟關係，不應反對。但是對於蘇聯企圖步日本的後塵，對於富庶的東九省作帝國主義的控制，則必須加以强烈的反對。……中國與朝鮮的獨立與福利，却應該最先加以考慮。」</p>
<p>不但與論界如此，美國政府當局更公開表示。雅爾泰協定宣佈之前，美國國務卿貝爾納斯更重中維持中國「門戶開放」之旨。又申明對中蘇談判深表關切，據華雄頓美國新聞處十二日電：「美國國務卿貝爾納斯昨日在答覆記者問題時宣稱：對於外蒙獨立之決定，中國國民政府將予尊重。……貝氏繼謂蔣委員長曾表示中蘇雙方已就處置東北日方財產與配備問題進行談判。美方請求中國隨時以談判情形見告，我等現已自中國獲得報吿一起。我人認爲此項問題，應由遠東委員會（尤其是該方面成立之賠償委員會）加以討論。</p>
<p>而十三日重慶合衆社又有如次一報道：美國國務鄕貝爾納斯要求中國政府將中蘇談判經過通知美國。此事已引起中國官方人士歡迎。彼等相信此事可减少在蘇軍撤退前中國將作之意外讓步，且使引起中國政府焦慮之問題得以公開。彼等贊成貝爾納斯之意見，由遠東委員會處置日本戰利品。</p>
<p>從此可看出美國的焦慮已達到「衝口而出」的地步了。眼看這種情勢發展下去，中國人從旁觀的立塲來觀察中國前途，不將和黎巴嫩，叙利亞，伊朗，希臘，荷印陷入同一的命運嗎？</p>
<p>四　從歷史的敎訓中尋求出路</p>
<p>中國戰勝了日宼，少數人驕妄自大的心理並不在一閉關時代」之下，我們不由自主地進入二十世紀五十年代，而我們的頭腦始終並不瞭解自身眞正的命運。道和歷史上的「閉關時代」有什麼不同？</p>
<p>惟有接受歷史的敎訓，再可以從中尋求出民族今後的出路。所以我們得瞭解歷史。</p>
<p>吾們須認識，東方的失敗於西方，乃是雅片戰爭時代的事。淸朝的失策，使東方陷於菲洲印度的命運。所謂「秦失其鹿，天下共逐之。」中國海沿岸的近代史，正是一部列强均勢演變史，中國局勢之動盪與東方國際均勢無不息息相關。</p>
<p>日本在七七以前，曾有一個極長的時期，它在中國的地位可以超然於列强之上。它的勢力挿入東亞大陸英俄兩大之間。隨後，帝俄瓦解，日本已繼承了它的地位，它的優勢又凌駕英國而上，英國又適逢其會逐漸衰退沒落，使日本自覺躊躇滿志。這促成了它的侵略野心……而終於又招致堅持「門戶開放」政策者美國的致命打擊。</p>
<p>本來中國恢復强盛之後，大陸均勢可以完全消滅。而事實上是「有名無實」，中國現在仍然孱弱。所以，東亞現在的情形，只是恢復了帝俄在東方勢力盛時的情形，而不是恢復了淸帝國盛時的局勢。中國可能挽回它的頹勢，而並非打敗日本即把頹勢挽回。開羅宣言以後，中國躋於列强之林，去年戰勝日本，國際地位，漸見穩固；加以百年來所遭束縛，諸如領事裁判權，租界等不平等條約均已廢除，所以大可剩此時機，力圖振作，以求名實相符。</p>
<p>然而新的不平等條約業已加上，中國自由發展的前途仍受障碍。中國與伊朗朝鮮同其命運。道正是客觀的新均勢在作崇，而美國竟不期然喚出重申中國「門戶開放」政策的呼聲。這在困鬥百年初獲解放而不旋踵又將就縛的中華民族，將　何警覺惕勵以圖力洗恥辱啊？眼看轉弱為強的機會稍縱即逝，我願大家快回過頭來看看，不要儘自己人哄着鬧分贓了。</p>
<p>我們目覩當前西北與東北的危機，我們回想北宋，南明招致外援的結果，眞使人不寒而慄。但是我們預料，中國前途的命運，尙不致完全聽命於外來的「北族」。這正是國際均勢作了我們的救星，但是如果完全仰仗「門戶開放」，全身投入外國的懷抱，中國將是怎樣一個世界？前途寗非萬刧而不復？須知利用國際均勢是無法之中的法子，可一而不可再，更不　因此　倖而得意忘形！而這一回眼看又將不得不走上老路，　是被迫，外交次不是我們眞正出路。我們必須自力更生。前面有兩條路任憑大家抉擇，何去何從？</p>
<p>辛亥革命的失敗是太看重打倒滿洲而忽視共他一切。如果抗戰勝利的現階段，也太看重了打倒日本帝國主義所得的勝利，而忽視了今後的建設工作，還須大家和衷共濟，那麼我們八年來的努力，其成就也不會在辛亥革命之上。辛亥革命以後根本不知道有國際的均勢，甚至軍閥自己也捲入了列强勾心鬥角的　過之中，結果是民國十四年前的一團糟，而外蒙和西藏的問題始終不得正當的解次。抗戰勝利後的現階段，次不容許重蹈覆轍。我們當前的任務是建立基本國策，我們並不排外，我們要研究怎樣維持道一個均勢，不再使某一方面「獨佔』中國或「共享」中國；而是使中國從國際的夾縫中衝出去，寇成民族眞正自由獨立的使命。（完）</p>

<p>編者先生：今有一個敎育問題，請予解答，或請轉陳有關當局解釋。因見貴報敎育欄，載有收復區敵偽專科以上學校畢業生舉辦登記甄審。此所謂「敵僞」，當然指敵僞設立之學校而言，不知抗戰軍興後，上海私立之專科以上學校，禾及取得敎育部認可資格，而太平洋戰事發生，日宼侵佔租界，不甘敵僞壓迫，不願供其利用，以致停辦，其忠貞自守之精神，有足多者。在此塲合，其已畢業之學籍，今敎育部尙未有明文頒布，反而敵僞設立之學校，獨沾勝利之光。况當日求學擇校，旣無力往大後方，淪陷區內之高等學府，與其人敵僞之門，不如就私立學校，比較淸白，亟盼敎育當局，注意及之，以爲漯身自好者勉。（楊啓）</p>
<p>編者按：楊君所云，不無見地。太平洋戰爭發生以前，本市私立專科以上學校，雖未經敎部認可資格，但其已畢業之學籍，除附逆學校外，概應變通辦理，予以承認，所以示撫慰，亦所以明順述。拙見如此，不知敎育當局以爲何如？</p>

<h3 id="c67">南園 <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— 施濟美</p>
<p>昨天，我去過南園，像浪跡多年的遊子從異鄕歸來——憂愁的，但是不無甜味的歸來。</p>
<p>那兩扇黑色的大鐵門還是那樣的開着，只是看門的却換了個年輕人，我恍然才想起從前的老許，那個忠厚誠實的老頭兒已經在鄉下被敵人打死了。</p>
<p>還有門房窗口掛着的一隻八哥呢？那倘老許的愛物，牠會說：「羅先生來啦！羅先生來啦。」這是老許敎牠的，因爲我們沒事就要溜出校外去，羅先生是提起來也呌人胆戰的訓育主任。</p>
<p>現在，那隻八哥沒有了，也許和愛牠的老許一樣，早就離開這個世界了。</p>
<p>灰色的圍牆依然無恙，刦後餘生的幾株大樹，葉子落盡了，向上伸出的粗悍的枝挜，好像巨人的手掌，托住了暗沉沉的像要落下來的灰巴多雲的天。</p>
<p>我眞後悔來的，尤其是在這樣的天氣，又沒有的一二個當初的朋友。</p>
<p>沒有太陽。灰色的牆，灰色的校舍，灰極的雲天，灰色的舊地，重來的心……</p>
<p>在會客室裏，我看見了孫先生，現在的校長，也就是已故金校長的夫人。她慈和的笑着，親切的招呼我坐，像看見闊別多年的一家人。</p>
<p>『你比以前高了許多，』孫先生說：『難怪我們要老了。』</p>
<p>『不、您還是從前那個樣兒，』我吿訴她，却並非是虛詞。</p>
<p>『要是在路上碰見，我認識您，您可未必記得我是誰吧？』</p>
<p>『怎麼不記得？』她搖搖頭，否認了我的話“『我還能說出你的幾個好朋友的名字，沙黎，奚家姊妹……』</p>
<p>「還有幽蘭夫人李淸仁，皮球黃德徵，』我搶着接下去：『我們自稱六君子。』</p>
<p>孫先生笑了，關於『六君子」的許多有趣事情她還不十分淸楚。『淸仁已經結婚，在杭州我知道，其餘的四個人呢？她們都好？</p>
<p>我將她們的近况告訴她，說起沙黎的死，全都不勝感慨，那樣一個絕頂聰明的女孩子，爲什麼天不假年？</p>
<p>之後我們又談起許多許多的人，麗珠，克紋，和微中；還有昭明，她還記得是我們班上最美而又有才氣的一個。</p>
<p>提起寧祥，我們比忱惜沙黎的死更爲難受，她現在大概仍在成都，勝利的今朝，戰爭不再，當她提起「壯志未酬身先死」的威齌的時候，她將何以為懷？是悲？是喜？是悲喜無主的度着往後的一日如一年的日子？還有那連父親一面也沒見過的小女娃望回，現在或許已經入幼稚園了。</p>
<p>道一切觸動了孫先生的心事，她沉默了大半天，是不是想起了過世的金校長？在戰亂初起的時候，金校長不顧自已身體的衰弱，忙着學校遷移，嚐受了那麼多的奔波之苦，因此才一病不起，丟下他的太太，惟一的愛女，和他親手創辦的學校。要是沒有戰爭也許金枚長現在仍然健在。</p>
<p>我深悔自己失言，連忙談些一別的話。</p>
<p>有一陣輕盈的笑語，從走廊那一端傳過來，不知是那一班的女孩子下課了？</p>
<p>我覺得已經坐了好久，於是辭別了孫先生，她叮嚀着有空再到南園來。</p>
<p>我走下石級，看見園裏大概的情形，有一種物是人非的感慨。</p>
<p>小橋，流水，假山都還在，只是梅花樹已經沒有了，那一定是被日本兵砍掉的，因爲這是我們的國花。</p>
<p>窗前的冬靑旁，有山茶正開着花，從前並沒有，從前這兒只有像山茶一樣嬌艷的女兒的臉，有許多次捉迷藏的時候有人躲在這兒的。</p>
<p>鞦韆架還在，愛湯踿韆的沙黎呢？</p>
<p>茅亭沒有了，記得分離的前夕，我們『六君子』在那兒秉燭而談了一個漫漫長夜，直到天明的時候。</p>
<p>對過宿舍裏有人走出來，　小玲瓏的身材，披着綠色的雨衣，她多像當年的楚玉呀！</p>
<p>有雨絲風片飄過，我不能再多流連了。</p>
<p>走出南多園，我想起上一次我離開這兒，正是榴花開得正紅的時節，一九三七年，蘆溝橋事變的前半個月。</p>
<p>八年多了，這滄海桑田的一別。</p>
<p>一陣鐘聲，隔着圍牆，從南園裏傳出來，傳出來，我不知道是上課還是下課？這聲音似生疏而又熟悉，經過幾年敵軍的佔駐，校址一再移遷，這個鐘想必早不是當初的那個鐘了，敲鐘的人自然也換了一個，聽着這鐘聲上課下課的女孩子們更不是從前的那些人了。然而這聲音，這響亮淸澈的聲音，無論是發自當初的鐘或是現在的鐘，無論是誰敲，也無論是爲誰而敲，牠的意義永久如此，永久是今昔無異的在吿訴人指示人人學習，休息，工作，休息……</p>
<p>因此我想起心力交瘁的金校長，以及繼鑫枚長遣志而熱心辦學的孫先生，我相今天南園的鐘聲將永遠這響著。</p>
<p>我走得漸漸的遠了，但是那鐘聲，響亮淸澈的鐘聲還在耳畔響着，永遠，永遠……</p>

<p>— 趙清閣</p>
<p>墨老爺太器重廳華的緣故，從這時侯起，他便開始敎她認字。可是墨太太反對，她說：女孩兒家用不着今書，「無才便是德。」墨老爺不以爲然，雖不敢公然抗議，背地裏却照舊履行他的敎務。麗華非常聰明，凡是墨老爺敎過她一遍的字，她都能熟諗地記住。她很愛念書，不大喜歡玩兒。手裏緊抱着一本「千字文」，嘴裘不斷「吱咕吱呫』地背誦着。</p>
<p>寳鈴如今已是十六歲的人了！兩年前墨老爺把他送進一個初中學堂裏念書，因爲墨老爺懂得舊的東西完了，應當追求新的東西。寳鈴非常感激墨老爺給予他的這種提拔，沒有墨老爺，他便不能够趕上時代，而跟着時代進步。</p>
<p>墨老爺把整個希望都寄托在兒女的身上，也盡他最大的力量培植他們。而對於他自己，依然是苟延殘喘的態度。他已經沒有什麼玄想了，也沒有什麼苛求。他是在逐漸地衰弱，與逐漸地蒼老下去了！</p>
<p>墨太太健康如恒，依然唯我獨尊地倣居一家之上！也照樣和墨老爺處得不投機。她也愛麗華，但是當她看見麗華常爲墨老爺所吸引去的時候，她又嫉妒。她恨墨老爺分剝了孩子們對她的感情。她記得，麗華第一次看見墨老爺的時侯，曾經大哭，當時她還以爲麗華和墨老爺無緣，討厭墨老爺。可是如今不然，墨老爺會用書誘惑她，像從前誘惑寳鈴那樣，一個個都疎遠了墨太太，使墨太太一切撲了個空。因此，她賭咒立誓，永遠不再生孩子。她說：『我栽樹，讓別人來乘凉，這是不公道的。』所以她武斷地認爲孩子應當屬于她自己。爲了這個問題，他們爭吵過很多次。</p>
<p>『你可以讓孩子們不睬我呀！』</p>
<p>有一次老爺就這樣搪塞墨太太。但他心裏却悄悄地說：</p>
<p>『只要你有力量能够控制孩子們。』</p>
<p>『你少拿幾本子破書引誘他們就夠了！』</p>
<p>『可是，這是我作父親的責』任。墨老爺理直氣壯地說。</p>
<p>『責任？』墨太太瞪大了眼睛看着他說。『作父親的責任是要養他們，可是，你拿錢來！』墨太太說罷，向黑老爺伸出兩手。</p>

It was decided that they would come to Chongqing on the 22nd to hold the parade. They also drafted a declaration and slogans, demanding that the Soviet army immediately withdraw from the Northeast, Inner Mongolia should not be special, and the Chinese Communist Party should thoroughly implement the provisions regarding the Northeast in the armistice agreement.

The students participating in the strike are extremely emotional, even holding up a huge banner that reads "We are not afraid to fight." The patriotic movement of Chinese students has reached such a fervent level, which is unprecedented since the Japanese seized the Northeast in 1931. The ten thousand students are scheduled to participate in a large-scale demonstration parade on Friday, which will pass through the streets and suburbs of Chongqing, and will collectively go to the Soviet embassy to submit a written protest, while also sending a letter to the headquarters of the Communist Party, criticizing their new policy on the Northeast and urging the party to prioritize national interests above all else.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Chongqing of This Newspaper on the 21st] This morning, this reporter visited the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was informed that (1) Negotiations on the Northeast economic issue are continuing in Chongqing. (2) Our country will not make concessions on the Northeast issue beyond the Sino-Soviet Treaty. (3) The crux between China and the Soviet Union mainly lies in different views and interpretations of the treaty. For example, in Article 1 of the annex to the Sino-Soviet Treaty regarding the Chinese Changchun Railway Agreement, the phrase "subsidiary undertakings directly for the use of the railway" is viewed very differently by both parties. However, there is no issue of interpretation regarding the withdrawal of troops and the return of materials.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Peiping of the Associated Press on the 21st] Foreign observers here believe that the situation in Northeast China has quickly unfolded. The Chinese side now openly admits that the takeover work in the Northeast has completely come to a standstill. According to the Chinese-language evening newspaper, General Xiong Shihui, Director of the Northeast Headquarters, is currently stationed in Peiping, maintaining absolute silence and awaiting the final orders of the government.

They will go to Chongqing. Liu Guangpei also left here. According to reports, this plane flew from Peiping this morning, which is the only Chinese plane seen here in the past eight days.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Changchun of This Newspaper on the 20th] The group of 45 Hailar Mongolian Banner representatives who accompanied Chairman Wu of Xing'an Province to Peiping today arrived here from Hailar a few days ago. Their trip is related to the "Eastern Mongolia" autonomy issue. Hailar belongs to Xing'an Province, and the provincial government is still controlled by Boyan Mandu, the former puppet Manchukuo provincial governor. Boyan has long sought independence, and has in fact created an autonomous independent state. This time, sending representatives to Changchun and then to Peiping is clearly to seek a legal basis.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Army to Implement Reduction in Size Within Six Months, Quota Set at 800,000 <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Army Organization Temporarily Retained Before Military Orders are Unified</p>
<p>[Express Dispatch from Nanjing of This Newspaper on the 21st] Chongqing News: Although the new organization of the National Defense Army has not been announced, judging from the report of Lin Wei, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Military Administration, at the Political Consultative Conference, the second deliberation of this Military Reorganization Conference, and General Wedemeyer's recent speech at the Military Reorganization Conference, the army organization after the reorganization, before the unification of military orders, will temporarily retain the organization of the Group Army and the Army. Once military orders are unified, transportation is restored, and public security is ensured, the Group Army will be abolished, and the Army will be reduced to the Division, the Division to the Brigade, and the organization of the Regiment will be enriched and strengthened to meet modern requirements (the current strength of the national army, in terms of organization, includes 89 infantry armies and 140 divisions, including the three divisions of the Communist 18th Group Army). The cavalry consists of 10 armies and 13 divisions. In terms of numbers, there are approximately 3.8 million soldiers. If the expanded army and the puppet troops in North China and Northeast China are included, the total number is at least 4.5 million. Based on the national population of 450 million, each hundred people support one soldier, which should be sufficient to maintain peace at home and abroad. However, the current situation is the opposite. Therefore, after the news of President Chiang's advocacy of 精兵主義 (elite troopism) at the Reorganization Conference was released, generals and the people across the country unanimously supported it. It is reported that the Military Affairs Commission has decided to reduce the existing army strength to 1.8 million within six months, which is a major prerequisite for saving and building the country. The progress of this plan is currently encountering obstacles. According to qualified military personnel, the reorganization of the army has been delayed due to obstacles, and China's finances will also face an unimaginable crisis.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing of the Central News Agency on the 20th] The preliminary investigation report on the crimes of the enemy in the capital city, compiled by the Chief Prosecutor Chen Guang of the Capital City Local Court Prosecutor's Office, was officially disclosed. The first section of the investigation report provides an overview of the investigation process and its difficulties, and, based on the materials obtained in the first phase, confirms that the number of people massacred in Nanjing has exceeded 300,000, and it is estimated that no fewer than 100,000 people have not yet been definitively accounted for. Future investigation work will continue to be actively carried out by all relevant agencies in an open manner, striving for thoroughness. The second section is divided into six sections: massacre, injury, rape, robbery, destruction, and other, recording this tragic situation in human history. The third section describes the investigation of individual crimes committed by the enemy and the massacre of people in groups. Regarding the enemy's massacres, the units involved included the Nakajima Battalion, the Nakayama Battalion, the Hasegawa Battalion, the Minoura Battalion, the Inoki Battalion, the Tokugawa Battalion, the Mizuno Battalion, and the Osui Battalion, totaling nine units. They massacred 279,586 of our compatriots, including 2,873 buried in the court grounds, more than 7,000 in the vicinity of the arsenal and the Tiger God Temple outside the South Gate, 73,718 in Caoxie Gorge, more than 3,000 at Hanzhong Gate, and more than 2,000 at Linggu Temple. In addition, the Red Swastika Society buried more than 155,300 corpses. The burial locations and numbers are very clear and have been attested to by the handlers. To further clarify the burial situation of each agency, more than 20 photos of the burial areas, the few remaining scorched areas, have been taken as evidence. The final section describes the thoughts and suggestions after the investigation, totaling four points: (1) Commemorate the military and civilians who suffered disasters; (2) Provide relief to the victims and their families; (3) Commend charitable organizations; (4) Establish a wax museum to ensure that the crimes of the enemy are forever etched in the minds of the Chinese people.</p>

<p>— Shi Zhigang</p>
<p>3.  American Concern for China</p>
<p>Due to the recent fading situation, the United States has become increasingly concerned about China. We can say that American concern for China did not begin today, but recent trends have become more obvious. After Washington announced the Yalta Agreement, public opinion was in uproar. Article 2 of the Yalta Agreement clearly pointed out that "the Soviet Union should restore the rights of the former Russian Empire, which were damaged by Japan's cunning attack in 1904." At the same time, American newspapers unanimously criticized the agreement after its announcement, especially regarding the situation in Northeast China. For example, the editorial of the "New York Herald Tribune" on December 12 stated:</p>
<p>"The price of Soviet participation in the Pacific is stipulated in the Yalta Agreement. Although there are some criticisms of the Yalta Agreement in general, if the Soviet Union can abide by its promises and respect Chinese sovereignty, this is not something to criticize too harshly. If the Soviet Union can firmly adhere to its promises in spirit and in letter to maintain Chinese sovereignty, then everything will be fine. However, in recent months, the actions of military officials in the three eastern provinces have been somewhat unsatisfactory. Sometimes Chinese officials have not been treated properly. Large quantities of food and machinery have been moved away, and some well-equipped local armies are now expanding their power. There have also been so-called independence movements. The United States has a significant concern in maintaining the territorial integrity of China (including the three eastern provinces). For the past ten years, the United States has opposed every attempt by a foreign country to rule any part of China. For the above reasons, the Soviet Union's future actions in the three eastern provinces will be the best test of whether US-Soviet relations will improve or worsen."</p>
<p>Precisely because the United States does not trust "such a powerful country" as the Soviet Union, it wants to "oppose a foreign country ruling any part of China," and it expresses this by reiterating the "Open Door" policy and maintaining China's territorial sovereignty and integrity.</p>
<p>From this, we can get a concept: In order to reduce its own sacrifices in the war against Japan, Britain and the United States accommodated the Soviet Union, being generous at the expense of others. They would rather regret it later. Just as the Japanese pirates had just surrendered and the people of democratic countries around the world were overwhelmed with victory, some people had already coldly pointed it out. (Such as the remarks of Powell and others in the local "Millard's Review," which the United States is only now taking seriously.)</p>
<p>The "New York Herald Tribune" editorial on February 7 also said: "...Although the interests of American merchants must be sacrificed, the basic desire of the United States in the three eastern provinces should be to maintain the traditional forces of Chinese territorial integrity. The three eastern provinces are Chinese in race, language, and culture, not Soviet. Normal economic relations between China and the Soviet Union in the three eastern provinces should not be opposed. However, any attempt by the Soviet Union to follow in Japan's footsteps and exercise imperialist control over the wealthy three eastern provinces must be strongly opposed. ...The independence and welfare of China and Korea should be given the highest priority."</p>
<p>Not only public opinion circles think so, but the American government authorities have also publicly stated this. Before the announcement of the Yalta Agreement, US Secretary of State Byrnes reiterated the importance of maintaining China's "Open Door" policy. He also stated that he was deeply concerned about the Sino-Soviet negotiations. According to a Washington dispatch from the US News Service on the 12th: "US Secretary of State Byrnes declared yesterday in response to reporters' questions that the Chinese National Government will respect the decision on the independence of Outer Mongolia. ...Byrnes continued that President Chiang had indicated that China and the Soviet Union were negotiating on the handling of Japanese property and equipment in the Northeast. The US has requested China to keep it informed of the progress of the negotiations, and we have now received a report from China. We believe that this issue should be discussed by the Far Eastern Commission (especially the compensation committee established in this regard)."</p>
<p>And on the 13th, the Chongqing United Press had the following report: US Secretary of State Byrnes requested the Chinese government to inform the United States of the progress of the Sino-Soviet negotiations. This matter has been welcomed by Chinese officials. They believe that this can reduce the unexpected concessions that China will make before the Soviet withdrawal and make it possible to publicize issues that cause anxiety to the Chinese government. They agree with Byrnes's opinion that the Far Eastern Commission should handle Japanese spoils of war.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that America's anxiety has reached the point of "blurting out." Seeing this situation developing, from the perspective of an observer, wouldn't China's future be the same as that of Lebanon, Syria, Iran, Greece, and the Dutch East Indies?</p>
<p>4.  Seeking a Way Out from Historical Lessons</p>
<p>China defeated the Japanese pirates, but the psychology of arrogance and self-importance among a few people is no different from that of a "closed-door era." We have involuntarily entered the 1950s, but our minds still do not understand our true destiny. What is the difference between this and the "closed-door era" in history?</p>
<p>Only by accepting the lessons of history can we seek a way out for the nation in the future. Therefore, we must understand history.</p>
<p>We must recognize that the East's defeat by the West was a matter of the Opium War era. The Qing Dynasty's missteps led to the East falling into the fate of Africa and India. As the saying goes, "When the Qin loses its deer, the whole world chases after it." The modern history of China's coastline is a history of the evolution of the balance of power among the great powers, and the turmoil in China's situation is closely related to the international balance of power in the East.</p>
<p>Before the July 7th Incident, Japan had a very long period of time when its position in China was superior to that of other powers. Its power was inserted between the two great powers of Britain and Russia in the East Asian continent. Later, Imperial Russia disintegrated, and Japan inherited its position. Its advantage surpassed that of Britain, and Britain happened to gradually decline, which made Japan feel complacent. This promoted its aggressive ambitions... and eventually led to the fatal blow from the United States, which insisted on the "Open Door" policy.</p>
<p>Originally, after China regained its strength, the balance of power on the continent could be completely eliminated. But in fact, it is "nominal but not real." China is still weak now. Therefore, the current situation in East Asia is only a restoration of the situation when Imperial Russia's power was at its peak in the East, not a restoration of the situation when the Qing Empire was at its peak. China may be able to reverse its decline, but defeating Japan does not mean that it has reversed its decline. After the Cairo Declaration, China joined the ranks of the great powers. Last year's victory over Japan has gradually stabilized its international status. In addition, the shackles it has suffered for a century, such as consular jurisdiction and concessions, have been abolished, so it can take advantage of this opportunity to strive for revitalization in order to match its name with its reality.</p>
<p>However, new unequal treaties have already been added, and China's prospects for free development are still hindered. China shares the same fate as Iran and Korea. This is precisely the objective new balance of power at work, and the United States has inadvertently called out the call to reiterate China's "Open Door" policy. How should the Chinese nation, which has just been liberated after a century of struggle and is about to be bound again, be vigilant and strive to wash away its humiliation? Seeing the opportunity to turn weakness into strength fleeting, I urge everyone to turn around and take a look, and stop letting our own people bicker and squabble over the spoils.</p>
<p>We have witnessed the current crises in the Northwest and Northeast. We recall the results of the Northern Song and Southern Ming dynasties seeking foreign aid, which makes people shudder. But we predict that China's future destiny will not be completely at the mercy of foreign "northern tribes." This is precisely because the international balance of power has acted as our savior, but if we completely rely on the "Open Door" policy and throw ourselves into the arms of foreign countries, what kind of world will China be? Isn't the future doomed to eternal destruction? It must be understood that using the international balance of power is a method of last resort, which can only be used once and not again, and one must not become complacent as a result! But this time, it seems that we will have to go down the old road again, which is forced. Diplomacy is not our real way out. We must rely on our own efforts. There are two paths ahead for everyone to choose, which way to go?</p>
<p>The failure of the Xinhai Revolution was because it placed too much emphasis on overthrowing the Manchus and neglected everything else. If, at the current stage of victory in the Anti-Japanese War, we also place too much emphasis on the victory gained by defeating Japanese imperialism and neglect the construction work in the future, and everyone still does not work together harmoniously, then our efforts over the past eight years will not be more successful than the Xinhai Revolution. After the Xinhai Revolution, we didn't know about the international balance of power at all. Even the warlords themselves were involved in the power struggles of the great powers, resulting in a mess before the 14th year of the Republic of China, and the problems of Outer Mongolia and Tibet were never properly resolved. At the current stage after the victory in the Anti-Japanese War, we cannot allow history to repeat itself. Our current task is to establish basic national policies. We are not xenophobic. We want to study how to maintain this balance of power, so that one side no longer "exclusively occupies" China or "shares" China; but that China can break through the international cracks and achieve the true freedom and independence of the nation.

<h3 id="e17">The Soviet Union Announces the Incorporation of the Kuril Islands and Southern Sakhalin Island into its Territory; All Banks and Enterprises Are Nationalized; Japan Requests the Repatriation of People from Soviet-Occupied Areas <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 21st] The Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Presidium issued an order yesterday, announcing that the transportation, banks, enterprises, public utilities, and transportation equipment of the Kuril Islands and Southern Sakhalin Island would be nationalized. The two places were ceded to the Soviet Union by the secret agreement of the Yalta Conference. Another order combines the Kuril Islands and Southern Sakhalin Island into one province, incorporating them into the Khabarovsk Krai of the Soviet Far East. Sakhalin Island is a long, narrow island off the northeast coast, which was previously divided between the Soviet Union and Japan. The southern part of the island belonged to Japan, but is now occupied by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 20th] The Japanese government has repeatedly formally requested the United Nations to assist in the repatriation of Japanese people from Soviet-occupied areas. Its most recent request was forwarded by the Supreme Commander's Headquarters to the Washington government two days ago. Further actions will be decided by Washington. According to Japanese government reports, there are currently a total of 2,640,000 Japanese people in the three eastern provinces, northern Korea, the Kuril Islands, and Southern Sakhalin Island, of which 855,000 were originally soldiers. There are 1,200,000 civilians and 700,000 soldiers remaining in the Soviet Union and the three eastern provinces (including Kwantung). There are 250,000 civilians and 90,000 soldiers in northern Korea. There are 15,000 civilians and 45,000 soldiers in the Kuril Islands. There are 300,000 civilians and 20,000 soldiers in Southern Sakhalin Island. To date, very few Japanese people have returned from Korea and the Kuril Islands. Reports say that they escaped from these two places, rather than being repatriated. There is no news from the three eastern provinces, which is causing increasing anxiety among their relatives. Yesterday, a mass rally was held in Tokyo to petition the government to make further efforts to repatriate Japanese residents.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] Moscow Radio broadcast a statement by the Soviet government yesterday, saying that some Soviet spies had obtained certain technical information from Canada. However, after research, it was found that the Soviet Union's technology in this area was even more advanced than what was learned. The actions of these spies were not ordered, so they have been withdrawn. Since the Canadian government first announced the "leak of secrets," Canadian newspapers and radio stations have abused me with attacks. The Soviet government believes that it is necessary to draw their attention to the fact that the Canadian government's attitude directly encourages attacks on the Soviet Union, which is not in line with normal relations between the two countries. The above statement has been delivered to the Canadian Chargé d'Affaires in the Soviet Union by the Soviet Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>[United Press, Ottawa, 21st] A government spokesman declared today that the Soviet Union is making a big fuss about the Canadian spy case. The Soviet Union's official note should arrive here this Thursday. The Canadian government will immediately give a brief reply, and then wait for the results of the thorough investigation of the case. Then it will reply to the Soviet Union point by point.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Ottawa, 20th] The Canadian government denied today that the severance of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Canada is imminent, and denied that it has ever considered this.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Ottawa, 21st] Regarding the leak of certain secrets, the Royal Commission is still conducting a major investigation. The Canadian government is being urged by the parties to publish a new official report on this matter as soon as possible. The British and American governments are in close contact with the Canadian authorities and are receiving notifications of the progress of the investigation at any time.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Ottawa, 21st] The Ottawa Daily News reported yesterday that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police have captured the leader of a foreign spy network operating in Canada, who used the alias Arthur Adams.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 20th] According to Ottawa sources, the Canadian authorities have arrested many Allied spies, most of whom are Canadians and are employed by foreign groups involved in the atomic spy case.</p>
<p>[United Press, Birmingham, 20th] Professor Oliphant, a physics professor at the University of Birmingham and a British atomic bomb expert, confirmed US Secretary of State Byrnes's statement that the secrets of the atomic bomb are still exclusively possessed by the United States. Oliphant participated in the manufacture of the atomic bomb in the United States. He said: "I am very pleased with Byrnes's revelation. British scientists have long known about this. We all know the manufacturing method of a certain raw material, but I do not intend to announce what the second raw material is. We only know its general outline. No Englishman participated in the manufacturing of that part of the atomic bomb."</p>

<p>[Our Report] A London broadcast on the 21st said that the Royal Indian Navy sailors' strike is expanding.

<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] The British House of Commons began a two-day foreign policy debate yesterday. Conservative MP Macmillan, who served as Cabinet Minister Resident in the Mediterranean during the end of the war, made an important speech, solemnly warning that the spirit of cooperation between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union during the war has been undermined by a high degree of suspicion. Soviet diplomacy seems to be focusing pressure on the Mediterranean region and the Middle East, infringing on long-established and recognized British interests in the region. Relations between the great powers have reached an alarming level of tension. What does Soviet Russia want? What is its underlying motivation? Is it the same as the expansionist policy of the Tsarist era in the 19th century? Does Soviet Russia have the ambition to rule the world? Is its purpose to realize its imperialism, or to restore its international communist ideals? Are the militarists regaining their power? The above questions are all possible explanations for Soviet actions. He also said: "Today's world has indeed been divided into economic, political, and military spheres of influence. We must not conceal the differences of opinion between the great powers. Statesmen should seek ways to resolve them. As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, I believe that it can only be resolved through personal contact or direct negotiations. Why doesn't Marshal Stalin take the lead in restoring the past relations between the three powers? All of this has created an atmosphere of suspicion. The only thing missing is large-scale espionage activities."</p>

The exact amount cannot be estimated at this time; (3) Transportation: All countries are busy with restoration. The United States is willing, but the main destination for overseas students is the United States. Unless transportation equipment is available, it will be impossible to start the journey.

<h3 id="e36">Letter to the Editor: The Issue of Academic Status of Private Schools in Shanghai during the Anti-Japanese War <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Editor: I have an educational question to ask for an answer or to forward to the relevant authorities for explanation. Because I saw in the education column of your newspaper that graduates of enemy and puppet vocational schools and above in the recovered areas are holding registration and examination. The so-called "enemy and puppet" of course refers to schools established by the enemy and puppet governments. I do not know whether private vocational schools and above in Shanghai after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War had obtained the qualification recognized by the Ministry of Education, and when the Pacific War broke out, the Japanese invaders occupied the concession, unwilling to be oppressed by the enemy and puppets, and unwilling to be used by them, they were forced to close down. Their spirit of loyalty and self-preservation is commendable. In this situation, the Ministry of Education has not yet promulgated a clear statement on their academic status of graduates. Instead, the schools established by the enemy and puppets alone enjoy the light of victory. Moreover, when choosing a school to study in those days, I had no strength to go to the rear area, and in the occupied area, instead of entering the door of the enemy and puppet, it was better to go to a private school, which was relatively clean. I earnestly hope that the education authorities will pay attention to this in order to encourage those who seek to be good. (Yang Qi)</p>
<p>Editor's note: Mr. Yang's remarks are not without merit. Before the outbreak of the Pacific War, although the private vocational schools and above in this city had not been recognized by the Ministry of Education, their academic status of graduates, except for the schools attached to the enemy, should be handled flexibly and recognized, so as to show consolation and to clarify the obedience. That is my humble opinion. What do the education authorities think?</p>

<h3 id="e38">Important Emergency Measures by the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration: Unlimited Sale of Flour <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Recently, food prices have soared, and flour is no exception. The black market has risen to about 8,500 national currency per bag. In order to cooperate with the government's parity policy, the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration had to take emergency measures. From yesterday, in addition to announcing the fundamental cancellation of the low-price sale to big cake stalls, noodle shops, and pasta snack shops that have been implemented for the past two months, the following new methods were adopted for completely unrestricted distribution: (1) The qualifications of buyers are not limited, and anyone can buy; (2) The quantity is not limited, and any number of bags are prepared for supply; (3) The price is set at 6,000 national currency per bag, which is 2,500 yuan lower than the market price; (4) Calculated in units, each household must apply to buy at least one unit at a time, and each unit has a total of 20 bags, and the total number of units is unlimited; (5) The administration has entrusted 12 banks to handle various procedures, including the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau at 36 Jiujiang Road, the Shanghai Commercial Savings Bank at 50 Ningbo Road, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank at 123 Fuzhou Road, the China Industrial Bank at 130 Beijing Road, the Zhejiang Xingye Bank at 630 Beijing Road, the Continental Bank at 111 Jiujiang Road, the Guohua Bank at 356 Beijing Road, the Zhongnan Bank at 110 Hankou Road, the Jin Cheng Bank at 200 Jiangxi Road, the China Reclamation Bank at 239 Beijing Road, the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank at 348 Henan Road, and the Zhonghui Bank at 143 Zhongzheng Road. It is heard that the procedures are very simple.</p>
<p>The administration is currently handling this unrestricted supply method in Shanghai and will soon spread it to other places, and food prices across the country may fall sharply. As for the flour that the administration has already prepared for emergency relief, it will continue to be distributed free of charge.</p>

<p>Grain Administration Authorities Post Notice to Strictly Manage Rice Market</p>
<p>At a time when the voices of cracking down on speculation and suppressing prices are soaring, gold and white rice rose sharply again yesterday under the manipulation of speculators, and other daily necessities all rose in unison, and the market situation was quite chaotic. Yesterday, gold reached a new price of 1.75 million yuan, and US dollars were also coaxed to 2,300 yuan. The most superior white japonica rice has reached 26,000 yuan, and it is still reluctant to sell, citing a scarcity of sources.</p>
<p>Restricting Entry Permits to the Rice Market</p>
<p>In order to restrict transactions, the Grain Administration Special Envoy's Office posted a notice in the market yesterday, saying: "In the case of the market being the place for the Shanghai rice industry to discuss transactions, when rice prices fluctuate indefinitely, the market should pay attention to strengthening management, preventing speculation, and avoiding manipulation, so that rice prices in the city tend to be stable. In the past, the market issued entry permits to members of the bean rice industry and rice industry associations, as well as brokers, etc., with a large and complex number of people, and management was difficult. Starting from today, the market should print new entry permits and strictly fill them out. Each rice firm should issue at most two entry permits. Rice firms that do not settle silver and goods in the market should be limited to one permit. The entry permits of brokers should be issued with special care. As for vendors, their rice is entrusted to rice firms for sale, and rice firms have their own reputation, so there is no need for temporary entry permits. Hereafter, those without permits shall not enter the market, and non-rice merchants shall not trade. If there is any private transfer or borrowing of names, once found, the person in charge of the market shall be responsible for revoking the entry permit and canceling their entry qualifications. The above items should be complied with and reported, and management measures should be drafted and reported to the office for review. This order."</p>

<h3 id="e56">Rice Prices Rise Uncontrollably: Food Problem for the People is Serious <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Subsidized Rice Sold at 18,000 [yuan] per Dan, Jardine Matheson Orders Australian Flour</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market saw strong sales, but the supply was limited. Retailers were busy buying from each other in the market, but because supply could not meet demand, prices gradually increased, rising more than 2,000 yuan from the previous day. The situation was extremely chaotic. The Grain Administration Bureau entrusted the same trade to sell indica rice at 18,000 yuan per dan, and retailers competed to buy it, which reduced market transactions. The Relief Administration also sold a large amount of subsidized flour, so although flour rose by 200-300 yuan, people’s hearts were softened. Yellow beans increased by 1,000 yuan, bean cakes by 200 yuan, and wheat bran by 200-300 yuan. The oil market saw strong buying from retailers, and prices jumped by 5,000-6,000 yuan. Cottonseed cakes also increased by 1,000 yuan, and corn rose by 1,000 yuan. It is said that Jardine Matheson is in contact to order a large quantity of Australian flour.</p>
<h3 id="e57">US Dollar Reaches New High <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US dollar reached a new high because free merchant ships imported goods, and yarn and cotton dealers aggressively bought more. Settlements for American cotton futures were re-established, opening at around 2,080 yuan in the morning and gradually rising to around 2,230 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, because gold trading became more inconvenient, the US dollar was even more sought after by the public, finally reaching a new high of around 2,380 yuan, a total increase of 330 yuan. Hong Kong dollars were also being bought by banks, with old notes rising by 45 yuan and new notes by 17 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Government Bonds and Chinese Stocks Rise <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Government bonds and Chinese and foreign stocks continue to be traded privately, with only a few deals being made. Category C bonds rose from 1,400 yuan to 1,750 yuan. Miscellaneous brands had less speculative activity and were only considered stable. Compared to the previous close, Categories A and B rose by 100 yuan, Category C by 300 yuan, Category D by 220 yuan, and Category E by 80 yuan. As for Chinese stocks, Wing On Textile rose to 2,250 yuan, American Asiatic to 1,750 yuan, Jingfu to 118 yuan, Xinguang to 110 yuan, and Quanxing to 95 yuan, fluctuating back and forth. Compared to the previous close, each rose by more than 10%. Foreign stocks were even quieter, with only more active inquiries for Jardine Matheson Textile and British &amp; Chinese Corporation. Jardine Matheson Textile rose by 10%, with demand exceeding supply. In the afternoon, prices for all items continued to rise.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Yarn, Cotton, and Cloth All Rise <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market became even more strong. Double Horse and Blue Phoenix each rose by one level. Double Horse was traded at 1.1 million, and Blue Phoenix was also priced at 1 million. Other brands were also boosted. 42-count double-strand yarn was particularly profitable, trading at 1.95 million, a sharp increase of 200,000 from the previous day. In the afternoon, gold prices rose again, and it was rumored that yarn prices at a certain teahouse continued to rise by 30-50,000, with little supply available.</p>
<p>Yesterday, spot cotton trading showed some improvement, and the market seemed to be tightening. Fangjian Company’s procurement of 42-count American cotton (Middling) increased sharply, with one brand accounting for 600 bales, and Xinsheng also imported 200 bales each of Nanlu, Taicang, and Haihuo machine-picked cotton. In addition, cotton firms also traded with each other, with transaction prices rising by 3,000-4,000 yuan across the board.</p>
<p>As black market speculation frequently reached new highs, the cloth market followed suit, and because customers had slightly increased their appetite, dyeing and weaving factories also aggressively sought plain white fabrics. Moreover, because the dyeing prices for various colored fabrics, shirts, and poplins were about to be adjusted, those holding goods had even more of an excuse [to raise prices].</p>
<h3 id="e60">Silk and Satin Rise Again <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Silk and satin, which had been sluggish for several days, showed a high-flying trend in the market yesterday. 120-count Tianqiao rayon spot goods opened at 2.05 million yuan and rose to close at 2.2 million yuan. In the afternoon, the asking price even reached 2.3 million yuan, 500,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Orders for stack documents were prohibited, and off-market prices were between 1.3 million and 1.4 million yuan. Factory silk trading was quiet, and prices rose with gold. Each grade increased by 50,000 yuan. Qianjing's five-dan head traded at 1.5 million yuan. Flannelette goods also experienced a surge in prices. American Asiatic bedspreads (100 pieces) cost 1.28 million yuan. Dachenggfeng was approximately 4,350 yuan per yard, an increase of 15% compared to the previous day. Linji wax feather yarn rose by 200 yuan per yard.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Ministry of Food Plans to Loan Money to Purchase Rice <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Due to the daily soaring rice prices in Shanghai, the Ministry of Food plans to first issue loans to rice traders, who will send personnel to purchase rice in the surrounding countryside, and then sell it to the Ministry of Food at the purchase price. The Ministry of Food will store the rice in the vaults of the Four Banks [a group of major state-owned banks] to increase rice reserves.</p>
<p>In order to understand the grain prices in various regions, the special commissioner of the Grain Administration stationed in Shanghai has dispatched personnel to Wuxi, Changshu, and other rice-producing areas, as well as Hangzhou and Huzhou (Wuxing), to conduct on-site investigations to adjust grain prices.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Black Market Speculation Reaches 1.75 Million: Black Market Jumps Higher and Higher <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spirit of speculation was even higher. International news helped buyers. Although it was a case of nervous overreaction and catching shadows based on rumors, the rumors had spread deep into the streets and alleys, with considerable influence. In the afternoon, the public security authorities took emergency measures, and it was rumored that arrests were being made. The trade stopped doing business, and the supply was even smaller. Although demand was sporadic, it was urgent. Transactions were even less transparent, and the source of goods was non-existent. The asking price was extraordinarily high. It was found that it opened in the morning at 1.53 million, hovering around 1.55 million for a long time. Later, as the authorities' inspections became stricter, the market price rose even faster due to the urgent needs of hot money, climbing to around 1.63 million by noon, more than 10% higher than the previous close. In the afternoon, the authorities took action to arrest people. Although demand was strong, it was extremely difficult to find a counterparty. The asking price continued to rise, and people felt even more panicked. After the banks closed, it had reached a new high of around 1.755 million. In addition to banning speculation, the authorities have no fundamental countermeasures. Things are valued according to their scarcity, and the future is unimaginable. Decorative gold has no market. Refined silver is at 1,600, and silver dollars are favored by scattered hot money, soaring to 950 yuan. Hidden interest rates are around two jiao.</p>

<p>The tea market situation is generally stable, but Keemun tea has made progress because the inventory on the market is weak, and major sellers insist on not selling, so prices have risen by more than 10,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Nanyuan (South Garden) <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>Yesterday, I went to Nanyuan, like a wandering son returning from a foreign land after many years – sorrowful, but not without a hint of sweetness.</p>
<p>The two large black iron gates were still open as before, but the gatekeeper had been replaced by a young man. It suddenly dawned on me that the old Xu of the past, that honest and sincere old man, had been killed by the enemy in the countryside.</p>
<p>And what about the myna bird hanging in the window of the gatehouse? That was old Xu's beloved pet. It would say, "Mr. Luo is here! Mr. Luo is here." Old Xu had taught it that because we would sneak out of the school whenever we had the chance, and Mr. Luo was the director of student affairs, whose name alone made people tremble.</p>
<p>Now, that myna bird is gone. Perhaps, like old Xu who loved it, it had long since left this world.</p>
<p>The gray walls were still unharmed. The leaves had fallen from the few large trees that had survived the disaster. The rough branches that stretched upwards resembled the palms of giants, holding up the dull, gray, cloudy sky that seemed about to fall.</p>
<p>I really regretted coming, especially on such a day, and without one or two of my original friends.</p>
<p>There was no sun. Gray walls, gray school buildings, an extremely gray sky, a gray old place, a gray state of mind upon returning...</p>
<p>In the reception room, I saw Mrs. Sun, the current principal, who was also the wife of the late Principal Jin. She smiled kindly and greeted me warmly to sit down, as if she were seeing a member of her family whom she had not seen for many years.</p>
<p>"You've grown so much taller than before," Mrs. Sun said, "No wonder we're getting old."</p>
<p>"No, you're still the same as before," I told her, but these were not empty words.</p>
<p>"If we met on the street, I would recognize you, but you might not remember who I am, right?"</p>
<p>"How could I not remember?" She shook her head, denying my words. "I can still name a few of your good friends: Sha Li, the Xi sisters..."</p>
<p>"And Madam Youlan Li Qingren, Piqiu Huang Dezheng," I interjected, "We called ourselves the Six Gentlemen."</p>
<p>Mrs. Sun laughed. She was not very clear about many of the interesting things about the "Six Gentlemen." "Qingren is already married. I know she is in Hangzhou. What about the other four? Are they all well?"</p>
<p>I told her about their recent situations. When I mentioned Sha Li's death, we were all filled with emotion. Why did heaven not grant that extremely intelligent girl a longer life?</p>
<p>After that, we talked about many, many other people: Lizhu, Kewen, and Weizhong; and Zhaoming, who she still remembered as the most beautiful and talented in our class.</p>
<p>When we mentioned Ningxiang, we felt even more sorrow than when we mourned Sha Li's death. She is probably still in Chengdu now. In this victorious era, when the war is over, when she mentions the prestige of "dying before realizing one's ambitions," what will she feel? Will she be sad? Happy? Or will she spend her days, feeling neither sad nor happy, in a monotonous routine? And what about her little daughter, Wanghui, who never even met her father? She may already be in kindergarten.</p>
<p>All of this touched Mrs. Sun's heart. She was silent for a long time. Was she thinking about the late Principal Jin? At the beginning of the war, Principal Jin, regardless of his own failing health, busied himself with the school's relocation, enduring so much hardship that he became seriously ill and passed away, leaving behind his wife, his only beloved daughter, and the school he had founded with his own hands. If there had been no war, perhaps Principal Jin would still be alive today.</p>
<p>I deeply regretted my indiscretion and quickly changed the subject.</p>
<p>A burst of light laughter came from the end of the corridor. I wondered which class of girls had just finished their lesson.</p>
<p>I felt that I had been sitting for a long time, so I bid farewell to Mrs. Sun. She urged me to come to Nanyuan again when I had time.</p>
<p>I walked down the stone steps and looked at the general scenery of the garden. I felt a sense of things changing, people remaining the same.</p>
<p>The small bridge, the flowing water, and the artificial mountains were still there, but the plum trees were gone. They must have been cut down by the Japanese soldiers because it is our national flower.</p>
<p>Next to the Chinese holly in front of the window, camellias were in bloom, which had not been there before. Before, there were only the faces of the girls, as beautiful as camellias, and there were many times when people hid here during games of hide-and-seek.</p>
<p>The swing set was still there. Where was Sha Li, who loved to swing?</p>
<p>The thatched pavilion was gone. I remember that on the eve of our parting, we, the "Six Gentlemen," sat there holding candles and talking all night long, until dawn.</p>
<p>Someone came out of the dormitory opposite, a small and delicate figure wearing a green raincoat. She looked so much like Chu Yu back then!</p>
<p>Rain and wind blew past. I could no longer linger.</p>
<p>As I walked out of Nanyuan, I remembered the last time I left this place. It was when the pomegranate flowers were in full bloom, in 1937, half a month before the Lugou Bridge Incident.</p>
<p>More than eight years had passed, a separation that felt like an eternity.</p>
<p>A bell rang, passing through the walls, from inside Nanyuan. I didn't know if it was for the start or end of class. The sound seemed both unfamiliar and familiar. After several years of occupation by the enemy army and repeated relocations of the school, this bell must not have been the same bell as before, and the person ringing the bell must have been replaced. The girls listening to this bell for class must not have been the same girls as before. However, this sound, this clear and resonant sound, whether it came from the original bell or the current bell, whether it was rung by whomsoever, and whether it was rung for whomever, its meaning remained the same forever. It was forever the same, telling and instructing people to study, rest, work, rest...</p>
<p>Therefore, I thought of Principal Jin, who was exhausted in mind and body, and of Mrs. Sun, who inherited Principal Jin's will and enthusiastically ran the school. I believed that today, the bells of Nanyuan would continue to ring forever.</p>
<p>I walked further and further away, but the sound of the bell, the clear and resonant sound, still rang in my ears, forever, forever...</p>

<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Master Mo valued Lihua too much, and from that time on, he began to teach her to read. But Madam Mo objected, saying: Girls don't need books, "Lack of talent is a virtue." Master Mo disagreed. Although he did not dare to protest openly, he continued to fulfill his teaching duties in secret. Lihua was very smart, and she could remember everything Master Mo taught her once. She loved to read and did not like to play very much. She held a copy of the "Thousand Character Classic" tightly in her hands and kept reciting it.</p>
<p>Bao Ling was now sixteen years old! Two years ago, Master Mo sent him to a junior high school to study, because Master Mo understood that the old things were over and that new things should be pursued. Bao Ling was very grateful to Master Mo for giving him this opportunity. Without Master Mo, he would not be able to catch up with the times and keep up with the progress of the times.</p>
<p>Master Mo placed all his hopes on his children and did his best to cultivate them. As for himself, he continued to take a resigned attitude. He no longer had any fantasies, nor did he have any unreasonable demands. He was gradually weakening and growing old!</p>
<p>Madam Mo was still as healthy as ever, still dominating the family! And she still did not get along well with Master Mo. She also loved Lihua, but when she saw Lihua often being attracted to Master Mo, she became jealous. She hated Master Mo for dividing the children's feelings for her. She remembered that Lihua had cried the first time she saw Master Mo, and at that time she thought that Lihua and Master Mo were not meant to be together, and that she disliked Master Mo. But now it was different. Master Mo would use books to tempt her, just as he had tempted Bao Ling before, and one by one they all became estranged from Madam Mo, leaving Madam Mo with nothing. Therefore, she swore that she would never have another child. She said: "I plant the trees, and others come to enjoy the shade. This is unfair." So she dogmatically believed that children should belong to her. They had argued many times about this issue.</p>
<p>"You can make the children ignore me!"</p>
<p>Master Mo once used this excuse on Madam Mo. But in his heart, he quietly said:</p>
<p>"As long as you have the power to control the children."</p>
<p>"Just stop using those broken books to lure them!"</p>
<p>"But, this is my responsibility as a father," Master Mo said with confidence.</p>
<p>"Responsibility?" Madam Mo looked at him with wide eyes. "The responsibility of a father is to raise them, but you bring the money!" After Madam Mo finished speaking, she stretched out her hands to Master Mo.</p>

<p>Mr. Editor: You are concerned with all of humanity's problems, providing the highest level of social service, and are friends of mankind. Now, I need to trouble you to answer two pressing issues, and I hope you can inform me. I am from Sichuan. Five years ago, due to circumstances, I married someone who was not ideal. My husband is a typical warlord. Although I have ample food and clothing, I am not satisfied with mere material comfort. I want to create a life according to my own wishes. Therefore, taking advantage of the restored transportation, I ventured here alone last month. During the journey, I endured all kinds of human suffering, experiencing cold and war I had never known before! But I still do not regret it. I intend to work here and study at night. However, my relatives told me that I must wait for an opportunity. I have been waiting here for ten days now, and I still have to wait. Day after day passes. How can my current situation allow me to wait long? Before I succeed in my work, my heart is so anxious! Today, I read in your newspaper's literary section: "The New Woman's Re-departure," which reflects my view of life. Now, I truly wish to work here as a nurse, but I cannot find any recruitment advertisements. How should I proceed?</p>
<p>Second, I have a child who is almost four years old. I must first send her to a nursery. Are there any nurseries here? Where are they located? As someone unfamiliar with the people and the place, I feel difficulties everywhere. Please answer these two questions. I am deeply grateful. (Liu Zhenjun bows) (Answer) After reading your letter, I admire your courage and sympathize with your difficult situation. I hope you can find a way out with your perseverance. Nursing schools are not currently recruiting for this semester. Recruitment will begin in the next semester. If the transfer procedures are complete, it may be possible to arrange for you to join a class midway. This column is willing to assist with the introduction. For nurseries, please consult the YWCA in person.</p>
